[00:23:04] <BrazenBraden> why doesnt this work? http://jsfiddle.net/LDdfn/1/
[00:23:47] <BrazenBraden> is it because once the select is disabled, events are no longer fired for it?
[00:26:42] <bigbugjava> why fancybox and bootstrap corusal are event related..
[00:29:08] <Andy_G3> pheeew.  Just created a new website, a maraton 22 hour coidng session, i'm shattered now, but in a fulfilling kind of way :D
[00:29:41] <BrazenBraden> Andy_G3: can we see what you made?
[00:30:03] <Andy_G3> I'm nervous.. I don't want to show it yet, sorry :p
[00:30:12] <BrazenBraden> -.- then why tell us?
[00:30:30] <Andy_G3> dunno, was proud of myself I guess ^^
[00:30:48] <Andy_G3> It's a business website, so i'm abit cautios
[00:30:53] <Andy_G3> *cautious
[00:31:05] <zombieLemon> Im still waiting for my host provider to activate my account
[00:31:13] <zombieLemon> then I can finally get the website online :/
[00:31:31] <kevireilly> BrazenBraden: seems like it is related to it being disabled. Interesting.
[00:33:05] <iaj_> Lo there folks.
[00:50:10] <iaj_> I got a task to solve, I set up a jsfiddle for that one, available at http://jsfiddle.net/GcL9m/2/   -- here's what I want to do with jQuery: when the select box get's changed to some date, all the a hrefs of the buttons should change their id, but all to different ids (which I will in advance get from a database - like if date 2015 gets selected: button1's href should become id 9, button2's href should become id 12, button3's href sho
[00:53:42] <iaj_> oh the current fiddle is 3, http://jsfiddle.net/GcL9m/3/
[01:10:28] <bigbugjava> Someone must have happend this before, if I active box modals, dialogs, my bootstrap corusel disappears, cant seem to find a logic reason
[01:35:16] <trampi> Where is the changelog for jQuery Mobile 1.4.1 located?
[01:37:02] <Cork> doesn't look like there is one
[01:58:51] <iaj_> When I know the value I want to set a selectbox to (have that value selected), how can I actually perform that with jQuery?
[02:03:11] <Cork> iaj_: $(select).val(newValue)
[02:04:12] <iaj_> Cork: ahhh thanks tried with val() = ...
[02:04:13] <iaj_> :)
[02:05:53] <iaj_> Cork: shall I use $('a').prop("href", "link") .. or $('a').attr("href", "link")
[02:06:00] <iaj_> to set a link with jQuery?
[02:06:33] <Cork> iaj_: doens't matter
[02:06:38] <Cork> both will work
[02:06:53] <Cork> i usually use attr, but it really doesn't matter there
[02:12:55] <iaj_> Thanks :)
[02:13:18] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[02:14:18] <nicolas_FR> got a problem with closure / callback. Anyone could figure out why order of alerts is ACB for me (instead of ABC) ? http://jsfiddle.net/g65RH/2/
[02:15:02] <sacho> iaj_, there's no difference in this specific case since the prop and attribute update each other accordingly(although if you read the prop, it will always be an absolute url, while the attr will be whatever you set the prop/attr to)
[02:16:05] <iaj_> Cork: Is that the correct way of setting all values+hrefs of buttons when I change a selectbox?  http://jsfiddle.net/GcL9m/4/   <- does this cover when a user uses cursor keys to change the select box?
[02:16:10] <iaj_> sacho: ah thanks for the insight
[02:16:22] <Cork> nicolas_FR: you don't have a frozen value for i
[02:17:12] <Cork> hmm
[02:17:21] <Cork> nicolas_FR: btw looks like this is chrome only
[02:17:51] <Cork> nicolas_FR: btw do you really mean to call all timeouts at the same time?
[02:18:26] <Cork> nicolas_FR: if so, why not just move the for loop into the timeout function
[02:19:09] <Cork> iaj_: it is a way to do it yes
[02:19:17] <Cork> though i usually don't keep such data in js
[02:20:21] <Cork> nicolas_FR: so in other words; what is it exactly your trying to do?
[02:20:37] <Cork> iaj_: btw define your variables
[02:21:19] <nicolas_FR> Cork :) thanks for looking. Those are just examples to understand the way they work
[02:21:36] <Cork> nicolas_FR: well they don't make any sense
[02:22:15] <Cork> why user several timers if you want to delay the exact same amount of time?
[02:22:44] <nicolas_FR> Cork : why ? I though it was showing that the i variable was isolated in the closure or callback example
[02:23:10] <Cork> nicolas_FR: ya, sorry that was the first example
[02:23:36] <nicolas_FR> Cork : yes and first is wrong, it's on purpose
[02:23:42] <Cork> the later comes from timer intersission
[02:24:22] <Cork> you start 3 timers with ~2-3 ms apart
[02:24:30] <sacho> nicolas_FR, like I said in #javascript, you don't have any sequencing of those timers - you can't expect them to go in a certain order when you've scheduled them all for the same time
[02:24:45] <Cork> the browser will align them a bit
[02:24:55] <Cork> and in chrome you end up with a scrambled order
[02:25:10] <Cork> ya
[02:25:23] <nicolas_FR> sacho : why no guarantee ?
[02:25:29] <Cork> some engines to, but you aren't guaranteed that
[02:25:33] <Cork> nicolas_FR: it's async
[02:25:35] <sacho> why would you expect a guarantee?
[02:25:49] <Cork> by definition it isn't meant to go in order
[02:26:11] <Cork> if you want them in order, either chain them
[02:26:14] <nicolas_FR> sacho cork : well I though we were calling 3 timers quickly, but still first is first... ?
[02:26:23] <Cork> or move the timer outside the for loop
[02:26:25] <sacho> no, the standard doesn't specify any order
[02:26:30] <Cork> nicolas_FR: no
[02:26:40] <Cork> you are scheduling timers
[02:27:11] <Cork> inpersission in os timers means you don't know what order they will fire
[02:27:13] <iaj_> Cork: thanks:) Last question.. is it a good way to use a datarepresentation like $somearray["13.02.2014"] = 20
[02:27:38] <sacho> javascript arrays are not php arrays
[02:27:41] <Cork> iaj_: depends on the circumstance
[02:27:50] <Cork> and ya it is object not array
[02:28:27] <Cork> javascript arrays is what arrays is in most languages except in php
[02:28:45] <Cork> and assosiated arrays in php is what most languages calls maps, hash or objects
[02:28:57] <iaj_> Basically what I want is a way to have the same value thats being used as a value in the selectbox, which is a date actually.. to deliver me a certain id from an array.
[02:29:18] <iaj_> so like $foo["$date"] = $idfromthatdate;
[02:29:22] <iaj_> agh
[02:29:29] <iaj_> without the "
[02:29:36] <iaj_> Hm yeah I'm used to php :)
[02:29:42] <Cork> iaj_: then ya sounds like a good place for js objects
[02:29:59] <iaj_> Cork: can you tell me ahandy example?
[02:30:00] <Cork> it is the most efficient way to do value translations
[02:30:10] <iaj_> exact. thats how its called =D
[02:30:25] <Cork> var ids = { "13.02.2014": 20 };
[02:30:39] <Cork> or var ids = {}; ids["13.02.2014"] = 20;
[02:30:56] <abishek> I have a basic html page and within which I have an IFrame which loads a another page. The page within the iframe is bootstrap based. I have a modal inside the iframe, is it possible to invoke and show the modal on the parent page?
[02:30:56] <RageYL> hi
[02:31:23] <iaj_> perfect thanks Cork
[02:31:27] <Cork> abishek: is the page from the same domain?
[02:31:36] <iaj_> Then I can juust get the stuff by ids[currentdate] right?
[02:31:42] <Cork> yes
[02:31:48] <RageYL> i bind the keydown event and attach the tab event, but it overwrite my browser bindings, so i can't do ctrl + tab anymore...
[02:31:54] <RageYL> what can i do ?
[02:32:01] <abishek> Cork, yes, currently if I try to load the modal, it gets loaded within the iframe and not on the parent
[02:32:22] <Cork> oh
[02:32:27] <Cork> missed the last part of the question
[02:32:35] <nicolas_FR> cork / sacho : sorry but I don't see how to get the timers to be in the right order, if I want all 3 alerts to appear 1s after the loop call, but in the right order...
[02:32:46] <Cork> abishek: you have the modal on the parent page for that to work
[02:32:57] <Cork> abishek: you can't push content from an iframe to the parent
[02:33:27] <Cork> nicolas_FR: use the timer and in the callback run the for loop
[02:33:33] <Cork> no need for multiple timers
[02:33:48] <abishek> Cork, can you take a look at this http://cssdeck.com/labs/phx2s9ai
[02:34:05] <Cork> nicolas_FR: http://jsfiddle.net/g65RH/4/
[02:34:13] <Tomashe> hey guys, can u help me decide what method will be better for ajax post data.. : 1. generate the html inside a function and place right data in and then just place the entire html in the page. OR get the data and .find element , and replace .. for each value
[02:34:19] <Cork> opps syntax error :X
[02:34:20] <abishek> Cork, this code creates 2 iframes and the modal is within the iframe and is invoked
[02:34:21] <Tomashe> i want the best from resources and speed
[02:34:48] <Cork> nicolas_FR: http://jsfiddle.net/g65RH/5/
[02:35:04] <nicolas_FR> Cork : ah ok, I get it. So fact is we can have multiple timers with the same duration that will end in an expected way right ?
[02:35:16] <nicolas_FR> can > can't
[02:35:45] <Cork> nicolas_FR: cause of duration snapping you don't know where they end up ya
[02:36:15] <Cork> nicolas_FR: timers isn't a precise instrument
[02:36:26] <Cork> and for most cases is best to avoid if you can
[02:36:36] <Cork> (setInterval is even worse)
[02:36:37] <Tomashe> ?
[02:36:37] <nicolas_FR> Cork : ok thanks
[02:37:06] <Cork> abishek: if it is invoked inside the iframe it is limited to the view of the iframe
[02:37:11] <Cork> abishek: no way around that
[02:37:36] <Cork> nicolas_FR: there are other alternatives
[02:37:42] <Cork> but not sure what your trying to do so...
[02:38:29] <nicolas_FR> Cork : I was not trying to do anything, just looking into closure and the way they work
[02:38:35] <nicolas_FR> isolating variables
[02:39:36] <Tomashe> hey guys, can u help me decide what method will be better for ajax post data.. : 1. generate the html inside a function and place right data in and then just place the entire html in the page. OR get the data and .find element , and replace .. for each value . i want the best from resources and speed
[02:40:09] <Tomashe> so 10 finds , or object with 10 values that ggenerate html and place it in the right place ?
[02:40:30] <iaj_> Cork: Don't I have to use $ids?
[02:41:51] <Cork> iaj_: depends if you name the variable with $ in it
[02:42:04] <Cork> iaj_: $ is just a character like any other in javascript
[02:42:09] <iaj_> oh
[02:42:10] <Cork> it isn't special at all :)
[02:42:14] <iaj_> so I dont have to use $?
[02:42:18] <Cork> no
[02:42:20] <iaj_> :) thnks
[02:42:38] <Cork> jquerys use of $() is just a function $() {} (simplified)
[02:44:21] <Tomashe> hmm
[03:04:46] <Tomashe> hey guys, can u help me decide what method will be better for ajax post data.. : 1. generate the html inside a function and place right data in and then just place the entire html in the page. OR get the data and .find element , and replace .. for each value . i want the best from resources and speed
[03:07:55] <Cork> Tomashe: the html dump is by far the fastest
[03:08:15] <Cork> Tomashe: the second has the upper hand if you want to preserve event listeners though
[03:08:34] <Cork> Tomashe: also it depends on how much changes you need to make
[03:08:55] <Cork> if the number of changes isn't many the value change can be faster
[03:09:10] <Cork> it really all depends on the situation
[03:10:39] <Tomashe> hmm
[03:10:59] <Tomashe> arround 20values
[03:11:11] <Cork> so you just want to update 20 fields?
[03:11:12] <Tomashe> on each profile view
[03:11:15] <Tomashe> ues
[03:11:17] <Tomashe> Yes
[03:11:34] <Cork> if you would replace the entire html would you have to run js to restore functionality again?
[03:11:52] <Tomashe> what u mean?
[03:11:53] <Cork> like sliders or buttons or...
[03:12:06] <Cork> or is it just static html
[03:12:11] <Tomashe> its not static
[03:12:18] <Tomashe> i have event listerns ...
[03:13:39] <Cork> ok
[03:13:52] <Cork> well you could move the event listeners to be delegated
[03:13:58] <Cork> or ya update the values
[03:14:37] <Cork> but ya replacing the html is normally the fastest way if you don't need to restore js parts if you do
[03:15:04] <Tomashe> i dont need to restore any js parts
[03:15:23] <Tomashe> my entire js is on js files and event listeners to the body
[03:44:35] <bigbugjava> I have a problem with Bootstrap Corusel, the image slider works, but when I active an dialog from fancybox or box modal from bootstrap him self, the corusel disappears... any ideas?
[03:47:33] <fattest> why doesn't my second popover work? is it because they have the same id? I want to use the exact html code to create many popovers without changing the js, is it possible? http://jsfiddle.net/VUZhL/81/
[03:50:35] <terminal_geek> how can i refresh the page automatically after two minutes? I have 100 AJAx requests firing off, but some of them dont return... page refreshes when all 100 have come back, but theyre not so i need to just tell it to refresh anyway
[03:51:11] <bigbugjava> terminal_geek settimeour
[03:51:13] <terminal_geek> is it set interval or set timeout or something?
[03:51:14] <bigbugjava> settimeout
[03:51:21] <terminal_geek> settimeout cool
[03:51:40] <bigbugjava> umm interval seems more right actually, haven't code it. did set timeout
[03:51:49] <terminal_geek> setTimeout(function(){//blah},180);  like that?
[03:54:03] <terminal_geek> argh! is that milliseconds?
[03:56:15] <abishek> how can i access the elements inside an iframe from the parent page?
[04:05:41] <Cork> abishek: sure if the iframe is from the same domain you can access it with contains()
[04:05:44] <Cork> ?api contains
[04:05:44] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:05:50] <Cork> ?api contents
[04:05:50] <b-ot> Cork: .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[04:06:13] <bigbugjava> Corkkrkrkr
[04:06:16] <bigbugjava> ;)
[04:06:19] <Cork> abishek: if it is from a different domain, you can't though
[04:06:26] <Cork> ?
[04:06:37] <Cork> don't get the joke
[04:06:42] <abishek> Cork its on the same domain
[04:06:56] <bigbugjava> you might have an idea, cant find a solution with google anywhere
[04:07:07] <bigbugjava> wasn't a joke.. was calling for HELP.. lol
[04:07:59] <abishek> Cork, $('#iframeId').contents() ?
[04:08:05] <Cork> abishek: ya
[04:08:19] <abishek> Cork, throws and error TypeError: Object #<HTMLIFrameElement> has no method 'contents'
[04:08:46] <Cork> abishek: then you run it on the element not the jquery object
[04:09:14] <Cork> $('#iframeId').contents().find('something on the iframe page')
[04:10:32] <abishek> Cork, it throws TypeError: Object #<HTMLIFrameElement> has no method 'contents'. Wont your code do the same?
[04:12:31] <Cork> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/g7UyQ/
[04:15:23] <abishek> Cork, that looks the exact same code as what I have an it throws the error
[04:15:48] <Cork> abishek: then $ isn't jquery for you
[04:16:41] <abishek> $('#iframeId') outputs the iframe element, but $('#iframeId').contents() throws the error
[04:17:20] <Cork> abishek: $() shouldn't output the element
[04:17:30] <Cork> abishek: it should give you the jquery object
[04:17:39] <Cork> and that is why it fails for you
[04:17:47] <Cork> cause contents() isn't a dom function
[04:17:53] <Cork> it's jquery
[04:18:07] <abishek> ok
[04:32:40] <fRAiLtY-> In jquery-ui, if I  use .sortable to display a list of database objects, i.e an array returned from a query, can I still save their start and finish positions if sorted as when I refresh it loses their pos, could this be because I order them in the query?
[04:33:14] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/wdvQY/
[04:33:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you could use serialize()
[04:33:58] <drager> I have some json data; Object {data: "[{"answer": "Yes"}, {"answer": "No"}]"} how should I get the value "answer"? https://dpaste.de/6CyJ
[04:34:35] <Cork> krambiorix: you missed a ' http://jsfiddle.net/wdvQY/1/
[04:34:45] <Cork> krambiorix: or if you mean why you get is amount
[04:35:04] <Cork> 't' isn't 0-9$ . or , so it should be true
[04:35:30] <krambiorix> Cork, ok fixed the '
[04:35:41] <krambiorix> Cork, it should alert 'not an amount', no?
[04:35:49] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  What would I need a text string for? The query returns a list (of div's using .sortable) and I want to be able to move them about, which works, but maintain their position on refresh etc?
[04:36:07] <Cork> js> print(/[^0-9]/.test('a'))
[04:36:11] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:36:13] <Cork> js> print(/[^0-9]/.test('7'))
[04:36:16] <b-ot> Cork: false
[04:36:19] <Cork> js> print(/[0-9]/.test('7'))
[04:36:21] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:36:56] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you would have to send or store the serialized value
[04:37:05] <Cork> then you can use it to order the list
[04:37:17] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Excuse my ignorance, but send to where?
[04:37:25] <Cork> the server
[04:37:27] <krambiorix> Cork, so my jsfiddle is correct?
[04:37:35] <Cork> or store it in localstorage or similar
[04:37:50] <Cork> krambiorix: except the console.log
[04:38:02] <Cork> krambiorix: and you might want to not invert the tests
[04:38:18] <krambiorix> Cork, why invert?
[04:38:20] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/wdvQY/2/
[04:38:32] <Cork> you are inverting it right now
[04:38:41] <Cork> and you might want to not do so
[04:40:07] <krambiorix> Cork,  if test !== false ----> then it's a number, no?
[04:40:23] <Cork> krambiorix: with the last link yes
[04:40:27] <Cork> with the old one no
[04:40:42] <Cork> it tests if the string DOESN'T include 0-9 $ , or .
[04:40:54] <krambiorix> ooow
[04:41:24] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot for the lesson
[04:41:32] <Cork> also you could simplify the regex a bit
[04:41:48] <Cork> /[0-9$,.]+/ should be enough
[04:42:09] <Cork> or actually
[04:42:35] <Cork> /^[0-9$,.]+$/ if you just want to allow those and nothing else
[04:43:21] <krambiorix> Cork, only numbers and comma and dot
[04:43:33] <krambiorix> and nothing else
[04:45:52] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/TWpTT/ Little bit stuck, so I'm trying to serialise them then log what's happening :x
[04:47:10] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize
[04:47:23] <Cork> it isn't an option to serialize
[04:47:29] <Cork> opps to *sortable
[04:53:03] <lng> Hi! How do I suppress link opening in .on() block?
[04:53:19] <Cork> event.preventDefault()
[04:53:48] <lng> thanks!
[04:54:02] <drager> I have some json data; Object {data: "[{"answer": "Yes"}, {"answer": "No"}]"} how should I get the value "answer"? https://dpaste.de/6CyJ
[04:54:51] <lng> How may I get value of href attr?
[04:55:10] <Cork> drager: data[0].answer
[04:55:24] <Cork> lng: .attr('href')
[04:56:22] <lng> Cork: I need to get it from 'this'
[04:56:23] <drager> Cork: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'answer' of undefined
[04:56:39] <Cork> lng: $(this).attr('href') or just this.href
[04:56:50] <Cork> lng: though those two arn't exactly the same
[04:57:05] <Cork> this.getAttribute('href') would be
[04:57:33] <Cork> drager: wait the content of data is an object with a key data
[04:57:39] <Cork> and it's value is a string?
[04:57:40] <lng> Cork: thanks!
[04:57:49] <Cork> drager: looks like you should fix the server
[04:57:54] <Cork> that data looks messed up
[04:58:12] <drager> Yeah.. wait
[04:58:19] <Cork> drager: if you could show the raw response it would help
[04:58:57] <Cork> easiest would be to grab it from the browser network tab
[04:59:11] <drager> Cork: {"data": "[{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}, {\"answer\": \"No\"}]"}
[04:59:17] <Cork> ugg ya
[04:59:29] <Cork> you have json stringified inside json
[04:59:49] <Cork> that really should be fixed
[05:00:15] <drager> Cork: Yeah, will do
[05:00:17] <drager> Thanks man
[05:00:19] <Cork> JSON.parse(data.data)[0].answer if you can't fix it
[05:00:30] <Cork> (though it is an ugly hack)
[05:06:48] <lng> Why do I get "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLSpanElement> has no method 'prev'" using this.prev() on '</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil"></span>'?
[05:08:15] <drager> Cork: Now it works just fine, thanks
[05:08:28] <drager> (fixed the json output from the server)
[05:08:39] <Cork> lng: you need to wrap the dom element if you want to run jquery on it
[05:08:43] <Cork> lng: $(this).prev()
[05:09:24] <solucien> hi guys ! Is there such thing as a jquery on class change event?
[05:09:44] <Cork> solucien: no
[05:10:09] <Cork> there is no cross browser way to get this announced
[05:10:12] <solucien> for example if a button gets a .selected class , i want to execute a function that would change the background image of the button
[05:10:14] <lng> Cork: thanks
[05:10:26] <solucien> thanks ! i will try to do it some other way
[05:10:37] <Cork> solucien: why not do it in css?
[05:10:45] <Cork> sounds like it should solve that just fine
[05:11:02] <lng> Can anybody help me to get 59Ty2EM4 from <td class=""><span>59Ty2EM4</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil"></span></td> which is the content of this please/
[05:11:23] <Cork> lng: what is this in that list?
[05:11:25] <Cork> the td?
[05:11:39] <Cork> or the tr?
[05:11:40] <Cork> or?
[05:11:57] <lng> Cork: <td class=""><span>59Ty2EM4</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil"></span></td>
[05:12:03] <Cork> ?
[05:12:06] <Cork> ok?
[05:12:15] <Cork> what element is "this"?
[05:12:46] <Cork> i can't say how to get to the span if i don't know where you start
[05:12:47] <lng> Cork: sorry
[05:13:07] <solucien> because i have a lot of buttons , and they all use a bacground image url that is called "image1-selected.png" and "image1.png". I can't remove the "-selected" from a url in css
[05:13:16] <solucien> as far as i've researched
[05:13:26] <lng> Cork: this holds <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil"></span>
[05:13:42] <Cork> solucien: you mean you have <img> as buttons or what?
[05:13:55] <lng> Cork: there is previos sibling span I need value from
[05:14:02] <Cork> lng: $(this).prev().text()
[05:14:03] <solucien> i've used divs with background images as buttons
[05:14:07] <lng> Cork: wow
[05:14:20] <lng> nice
[05:14:27] <Cork> solucien: then you should easily be able to control the image from css
[05:14:38] <lng> Cork: cheers
[05:14:43] <Cork> lng: yw
[05:14:53] <solucien> but can i control the url("myurl") attribute in css?
[05:14:59] <Cork> sure
[05:15:06] <solucien> i need to change the myurl to myurl-selected
[05:15:55] <Cork> .button-type1 { background-image: url(myrul); } .button-type1.selected { background-image: url(myurl-selected); }
[05:16:01] <drager> Cork: How can I get the data in my Class? https://dpaste.de/AKyW
[05:16:25] <Cork> drager: you can't like that
[05:16:32] <Cork> ajax is async so you can't return it
[05:16:39] <Cork> you need to use the callback functions
[05:17:52] <drager> Cork: Hm, like how?
[05:18:20] <Cork> fetchData(url, callback)
[05:18:41] <Cork> this.fetchData(url, function(data) { /* work with data */ })
[05:19:00] <Cork> or use deferred if you like that structure better
[05:21:01] <drager> hm
[05:24:59] <drager> Cork: https://dpaste.de/nytv
[05:25:26] <solucien> Cork: thing is i have 7 buttons and they all use the same class . I don't have a button1, button2...button7 class. They are all using the same class , and the only difference between them is the fact that they use a different background-url
[05:25:27] <Cork> drager: as long as you don't try to use mm in the same code flow it would work ya
[05:25:37] <Cork> drager: though there is a race risk
[05:26:00] <Cork> solucien: and the url is set inline you mean?
[05:26:08] <solucien> exactly
[05:26:13] <Cork> then move it into the css file where it should be :)
[05:26:18] <Cork> and use class names
[05:26:28] <solucien> the url is coming from my CMS , since i'm creating a template
[05:26:40] <Cork> yuck...
[05:26:52] <Cork> why are cms systems always so horrible at handling these things...
[05:26:59] <solucien> so the user should be able to change the button  image
[05:27:14] <Cork> solucien: there is other way to do that
[05:27:28] <Cork> but server cms often just don't care
[05:27:38] <drager> Cork: Hm, I need to access this.mm in another file.
[05:28:01] <solucien> i am sure there is .. i don't want to have to dynamically generate my css file using php
[05:28:05] <Cork> drager: in response to an event, or as a result of calling your code?
[05:28:29] <Cork> solucien: well that would only be needed if you need to define it through php
[05:28:36] <Cork> it could be static set of options
[05:28:41] <Cork> and you just used them in php
[05:30:19] <michelem> hello folks
[05:30:42] <michelem> I'm looking for ideas to avoid captchas on a public form
[05:30:48] <drager> Cork: https://dpaste.de/LnK8
[05:30:58] <lng> Cork: sorry, I was a it wrong of the value I need. Actually I need the very first "td" value (OslDnnZL): http://pastebin.com/qHjnkt1S
[05:31:48] <michelem> I'm considering: 1) computational challenges automatically done in JS 2) a display:none "link" trap field that ignores the submit it filled
[05:31:58] <lng> Cork: could you help me once more?
[05:34:09] <lng> $(this).parent().parent() gives me tr. How to refer to the first td?
[05:34:40] <Cork> lng: $(this).closest('.even').find('.sorting_1').text()
[05:35:05] <lng> Cork: it might be odd as well :)
[05:35:18] <Cork> lng: or if you can't depend on .sorting_1 $(this).closest('.even').children().first().text()
[05:35:29] <Cork> ah
[05:35:34] <Cork> lng: $(this).closest('tr').find('.sorting_1').text()
[05:35:38] <lng> Cork: can't depend on those classes
[05:35:39] <Cork> lng: or if you can't depend on .sorting_1 $(this).closest('tr').children().first().text()
[05:35:57] <lng> awesome
[05:36:33] <lng> it works
[05:36:38] <lng> thanks
[05:38:47] <drager> Cork: So result in other words
[05:39:17] <Cork> drager: ah, sorry
[05:39:24] <Cork> ya, line 27 isn't possible
[05:39:38] <Cork> cause mm will be undefined there
[05:39:46] <drager> yeah
[05:39:48] <drager> but hm
[05:39:58] <drager> how should I get the data I want?
[05:39:58] <drager> :D
[05:39:58] <Cork> it won't be defined before the callback from the ajax call fires
[05:40:07] <Cork> drager: you would have to use a callback
[05:40:10] <Cork> like i said
[05:40:27] <Cork> you can't ever return the value from async calls
[05:40:39] <drager> I though I did
[05:40:43] <drager> +t
[05:40:44] <Cork> cause you will almost always try to access it before it exists
[05:41:01] <Cork> drager: line 9 + line 27 is the same thing as a return
[05:41:15] <Cork> drager: lets explain the code flow
[05:41:27] <Cork> * line 25 creates the class
[05:41:37] <Cork> * line 4 executes
[05:41:51] <Cork> line 8 is executed and calls line 15
[05:41:55] <PatBateman> how to query: "i want to find an input field with a specific class that has a value of 1" ?
[05:42:03] <Cork> * line 17 creates a call to the server
[05:42:04] <PatBateman> hi sorry
[05:42:14] <Cork> line 20 and line 13 executes
[05:42:20] <Cork> * line 27 executes
[05:42:25] <Cork> * line 29 executes
[05:42:34] <Cork> * line 18 executes
[05:42:41] <Cork> uhh just saw you use return callback there
[05:42:45] <Cork> that won't work
[05:43:04] <Cork> function(data) { callback(data); } is what you want
[05:43:31] <Cork> drager: the async nature of the code means line 18 is after line 27
[05:43:43] <Cork> *29
[05:44:40] <Cork> drager: so only way to pass the data from the function to another function is that the function that has the data calls a function to pass the data to
[05:45:16] <Cork> PatBateman: $('.someclass').filter(function() { return this.value == '1'; })
[05:46:27] <drager> Hm
[05:48:53] <bobbob72863> hi all
[05:49:09] <drager> Cork: So this is what I have atm; https://dpaste.de/VCae
[05:49:11] <bobbob72863> i'm looking for a good way to manage a big form
[05:49:39] <bobbob72863> a dynamic form
[05:50:04] <bobbob72863> does exist some good jquery plugins?
[05:51:50] <Cork> drager: again line 10 isn't possible
[05:51:57] <Cork> for the same reason as before
[05:52:29] <bobbob72863> no one? :)
[05:52:43] <drager> aw, im getting crazy
[05:55:53] <bobbob72863> :(
[05:56:46] <seutje> huh? I thought 'use strict' enforced you to explicitly leak to the global scope
[06:00:28] <drager> Cork: So how should I solve it?
[06:01:42] <Cork> drager: you need to write the code in a way where it works with callbacks instead of returns
[06:03:05] <Cork> drager: so ex. ClassObject.processData(function() {}) or something
[06:03:25] <skypce> hello guys , i have this code:http://pastebin.com/H0dtvkR0  for work with tabs, i need when page loads begin in a custom tab : example <li><a class="active"> how can i do it please?
[06:05:42] <nicolas_FR> jquery validation problem : I have 2 phone inputs, each with its own label for messages (success / error / tips) and I would like them to be valid as soon as at least 1 is filled. I was using "require_from_group" from the additionnal_methods from validation plugins, but it doesn't work if user don't click each input...
[06:06:18] <drager> Cork: I dont follow...
[06:06:50] <Cork> drager: have the caller of the class request the access to the data from a callback function call
[06:06:58] <Cork> then you can provide access that way
[06:07:31] <PatBateman> thanks
[06:07:35] <PatBateman> -> Cork
[06:09:13] <drager> Cork: Yeah, but in my fetchData I have the callback
[06:09:41] <doug65536> skypce: you're saying, how do I make sure that at least one tab has class=active ?
[06:09:43] <Cork> drager: you have a callback to the caller in the constructor
[06:10:01] <Cork> but not from the constructor to where you need the data
[06:10:40] <skypce> doug65536, yes when you load page the tab menu element will be the <a> with active class
[06:11:23] <skypce> doug65536, when load page begin with the tab that i choose
[06:12:54] <doug65536> skypce: to make the first tab active, a line before the code in your paste could be: $('ul.tabs').eq(0).addClass('active')
[06:13:47] <doug65536> change 0 to something else if you want the 2nd, 3rd etc initially selected
[06:13:54] <drager> Cork: Yeah, but I dont understand how to
[06:14:26] <skypce> very thank you doublerebel i will try
[06:14:37] <skypce> very thank you doug65536
[06:16:05] <reuf> hello - $("li").last() will get me the last li element of list, how do i get the element which is last-1, that is one before the last?
[06:16:47] <doug65536> reuf: $('li').eq(-2)
[06:16:58] <reuf> doug65536: thanks
[06:20:14] <Cork> drager: something like this https://dpaste.de/6yGy
[06:20:17] <reuf> doug65536: $('li').eq(-2) - when i get this element there is an element span within li  how do i get the span element?
[06:21:33] <doug65536> reuf: $('li').eq(-2).children('span').first()
[06:21:45] <reuf> doug65536: thanks
[06:21:51] <doug65536> if there is only one span child, you can omit .first()
[06:23:29] <andrewSC> hi all
[06:23:38] <doug65536> reuf: another approach might be $('li span').eq(-2)
[06:23:45] <doug65536> oops
[06:23:49] <doug65536> reuf: another approach might be $('li > span').eq(-2)
[06:23:59] <andrewSC> for jquery ui selectmenu plugin, is there a way to change multiple select menus without firing a change event every time you change the menu?
[06:23:59] <reuf> doug65536: thanks looks more clean
[06:24:08] <drager> Cork: Sweet, a big thanks to you
[06:24:14] <andrewSC> as in, one selectmenu changes manually via user and the others change automatically?
[07:02:49] <zafu> hi, with the parents() selector can I find the previous-sibling of each found parent?
[07:05:50] <Cork> zafu: yes
[07:05:58] <Cork> $().parents().prev()
[07:06:02] <zafu> yep :)
[07:06:41] <ankurk> How can I do column sorting using jQuery?
[07:10:00] <darthy> hello , http://jsfiddle.net/y2UYX/68/ in this fiddle , can someone explain me how the this.css = function (p) function is being used
[07:11:25] <Cork> DarkGhost: $.path.arc().css()
[07:14:10] <petey> what the hell am i doing wrong here? http://jsbin.com/kibav/1/edit
[07:14:20] <petey> i have flickering on hover but I set it on the container instead of the actual item
[07:15:19] <darthy> Cork: what is p ? how is it being passed? from where is it being passed?
[07:19:06] <fRAiLtY-> Why is data blank here? http://jsfiddle.net/8xzmz/
[07:19:25] <seutje> petey: img_container has no id
[07:19:44] <seutje> so mleh is undefined
[07:21:36] <petey> seutje sorry there's supposed to be area
[07:21:56] <petey> I forget that this is collaborative
[07:22:05] <petey> the javascript should be .img_container area and the area has an ID
[07:22:07] <petey> but it flickers like crazy
[07:23:02] <panzi> what do I need to do to build jquery ui from git so that I get the various modules and not one minified file?
[07:23:13] <darthy> Cork : any help? ideas
[07:23:49] <panzi> the readme only mentions "grunt concat", which builds one single file
[07:24:17] <panzi> simply copying the files under ui/ does not replace @VERSION with something meaningful, of course
[07:25:18] <seutje> petey: oh, I see, using hoverIntent would probably solve that
[07:26:07] <petey> Is there anyway I can solve it wihtout using a plugin seutje?
[07:26:16] <petey> I'm assuming it's because the li is interfering with the area
[07:26:27] <petey> I'll be back in a second.
[07:28:10] <seutje> sure, u could recreate the plugin in custom code
[07:28:25] <seutje> or debounce it... but I guess that's also considered a plugin
[07:33:11] <darthy> hello , http://jsfiddle.net/y2UYX/68/ in this fiddle , can someone explain me how the this.css = function (p) function is being used?
[07:33:17] <darthy> what is p ? how is it being passed? from where is it being passed?
[07:33:23] * darthy needs some help
[07:38:33] <mrbubbles> hey guys, if i've got an id of #contact form on my page, can I not use $(document).scrollTo('#contact-form'); to scroll to it? (I don't want animation, just literally to jump to the element like it would if you clicked on an href="#contact-form" link
[07:38:34] <mrbubbles> Thanks :)
[07:47:32] <lng> How do I find positional number of <td> (like array index) knowing one of <td> descendant?
[07:50:20] <pachet> walk up until you find the td, loop over previousSibling() until you hit null
[07:50:30] <pachet> the number of times that previousSibling() doesnt return null is your index
[07:51:37] <lng> pachet: I see, thansk
[08:02:41] <BillCriswell> lng: If you just need it from that row you can do $('td').index()
[08:06:40] <petey> Back
[08:06:42] <petey> seutje, are you still around? Any idea how I can fix that without using HoverIntent? http://jsbin.com/kibav/1/edit
[08:06:46] <petey> That flickering scroll is going to drive me nuts, but I am assuming its the overlay and the area fighting over the hover
[08:15:53] <ankurk> In this fiddle, why the text is getting split first? http://jsfiddle.net/ukW2C/3/
[08:17:14] <HenryCH> Hi guys I asked this in javascript with no luck so far, maybe someone here can help: http://jsfiddle.net/yMUaq/5/  the display: none seems to mess with the masonry library layout, but without that I can't hide the images and get the grey splashscreen to cover the whole screen (although the images are then in the correct layout). any ideas?
[08:17:20] <lng> pachet: why is it undefined? https://gist.github.com/lngphp/d6f0543627052d53a1a5
[08:17:38] <lng> BillCriswell: oh nice!
[08:19:15] <BillCriswell> lng: I think he meant el.prevAll().length
[08:19:47] <pachet> lol
[08:20:03] <pachet> to be honest i forgot this was #jquery, not ##javascript
[08:20:04] <pachet> sec
[08:20:16] <lng> BillCriswell: great! thanks!
[08:20:41] <lng> $(this).parent().index() is what I need
[08:22:19] <petey> http://jsbin.com/kibav/1/edit any idea how I can fix this flickering? I'm assuming that the overlay and the area map are fighting for the hover
[08:22:34] <petey> Someone else reccomended I use a plugin but I think it's an easy enough fix
[08:22:37] <lng> how may I substitute password property with variable? resp.user.password
[08:22:43] <petey> I just don't know what the missing link is, I know I"m almost there.
[08:22:56] <mrbubbles> Is there a jQuery version of document.getElementById('contact-form').scrollIntoView(true); ? Calling it on $('#contact-info') doesn't seem to work
[08:23:36] <BillCriswell> mrbubbles: You would need to do $('#contact-info')[0].scrollIntoView(true);
[08:24:06] <mrbubbles> Thanks BillCriswell
[08:24:22] <BillCriswell> If you're only doing $('#contact-info') to do $('#contact-info')[0] it's pretty pointless though.
[08:24:38] <lng> I need to use variable instead of password - resp.user.password
[08:24:54] <lng> something like resp.user.$password
[08:24:59] <lng> how can I do it?
[08:25:19] <BillCriswell> lng: Not sure I'm following you.
[08:25:29] <BillCriswell> lng: Og.
[08:25:30] <BillCriswell> Oh*
[08:25:39] <bee_keeper> can i do something like this with jquery - $(this).wrap("<div class='wrapped_img' style='{fl_dir}'></div>"); but {fl_dir} would be the name of my variable?
[08:25:57] <HenryCH> petey I only saw a flicker the first time I opened it
[08:26:12] <BillCriswell> resp.user.$password = 'whatever' should work I think.
[08:26:47] <petey> Gah it's not working right now HenryCH, are the overlays popping up for you?
[08:26:51] <lng> BillCriswell: var $password = 'foo' should be defined, right?
[08:27:04] <BillCriswell> It doesn't need to be.
[08:27:38] <petey> http://jsbin.com/kibav/4/edit
[08:28:01] <BillCriswell> resp.user.$password = resp.user.password; delete resp.user.password;
[08:28:07] <lng> BillCriswell: it is not substituted
[08:28:59] <HenryCH> nothing's popping up petey
[08:29:18] <BillCriswell> lng: I'm back to not following you.
[08:30:05] <petey> http://jsbin.com/kibav/4/edit if you hover over the image there should be an overlay HenryCH
[08:31:48] <HenryCH> yep see it now, and the flickering
[08:34:51] <petey> HenryCH any idea how I can fix that?
[08:36:01] <thomaslindstr_m> How can you tell from an event callback whether or not it was organic (not triggered by jQuery)?
[08:36:30] <duch_kazatel> I don't know that you can, thomaslindstr_m
[08:36:43] <thomaslindstr_m> Well shit
[08:36:47] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[08:37:23] <HenryCH> giving it a try petey but I'm no expert..
[08:37:31] <thomaslindstr_m> I'd like to know whether or not a scroll event was fired by jQuery or the user. It'd be so much simpler if I could just check the event callback, but nevermind if I can't
[08:38:05] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m are you firing the non-user-initiated scroll?
[08:38:11] <thomaslindstr_m> Yes
[08:38:26] <duch_kazatel> why not do something like event.preventDefault();?
[08:38:46] <duch_kazatel> or event.stopImmediatePropagation();
[08:38:52] <thomaslindstr_m> That'd defeat the purpose as I'm animating the scroll
[08:39:25] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you don't want something to fire in one case, but you do in another, right?
[08:39:46] <thomaslindstr_m> Pretty much, yes.
[08:40:05] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need to do some hand wiring.
[08:40:16] <thomaslindstr_m> I figured as much
[08:40:29] <thomaslindstr_m> Well, that's lame
[08:40:31] <thomaslindstr_m> but thank you
[08:41:07] <BillCriswell> petey: I did something similar a bit ago.
[08:42:10] <dcherman> thomaslindstr_m: When you say fired by jQuery, do you mean that *you* triggered a scroll event in JS?
[08:42:34] <BillCriswell> petey: Ok I remember what I did now.
[08:42:36] <thomaslindstr_m> Yes, of course. It's an animation
[08:42:57] <petey> BillCriswell is it because the layers are fighting for the hover?
[08:43:15] <phelix> Anyone know of a good tutorial that will show a newbie how to submit and get the results of a form from a submit button without having to reload the whole page?
[08:43:17] <thomaslindstr_m> but what I'd like is $(window).scroll(function(e) { if (e.isFromjQuery()) do something })
[08:43:33] <BillCriswell> Yes. What I did was put a transparent gif over the image that should have the image map and put the image map on that.
[08:43:43] <BillCriswell> petey: http://www.xmarkfitness.com/-strse-template/musclezone/Page.bok Just remembered the site
[08:44:27] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m i'd dump through the even object and see what's in there
[08:44:34] <duch_kazatel> *event
[08:44:46] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: I tried, saw no immediate differences
[08:45:05] <BillCriswell> The images load slow... they're too big I guess. With the right image optimizations you shoudl barely notice petey.
[08:45:56] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: Hang on.. the jQuery event seems to have a result key
[08:45:58] <petey> Howd you go about doing it?
[08:46:16] <BillCriswell> I can set up a fiddle for you.
[08:46:27] <petey> If you don't mind
[08:47:09] <BillCriswell> It's basically just layering things. The background is on the bottom, the highlighted area in the middle, and a transparent image on top with the image map and I just change the middle layer based on mouseover of certain areas.
[08:47:58] <petey> See I think that's what I have, but for some reason it still flickers
[08:49:15] <duch_kazatel> brb
[08:49:19] <jop008> Hi I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/123/ looks fine in Chrome safari and FF but fails in IE8 or IE9
[08:49:24] <jop008> where to start?
[08:50:03] <BillCriswell> petey: http://jsbin.com/mogab/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:52:33] <petey> Ah cool thanks BillCriswell!
[08:52:40] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:53:02] <farn5w0rth> if i have a table with many decimal places, how do i limit that to say 2 decimal points?
[08:53:05] <pugtor> Hey guys, is there anyway with Chrome's Dev Tools (or anything else!) that can show me jquery dynamic styling? I mean it's normally fairly easy to spot .css calls in a jquery script but this one is a pita to try and decipher. I thought about simply doing removeAttr( 'style' ); but I'd like for it to be a little more clean. :-/
[08:53:26] <HenryCH> Could you not replace toggle with show and then have the exit pointer callback hide()?
[08:54:15] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: toFixed(2)
[08:54:58] <farn5w0rth> oh beautiful - thanks BillCriswell
[08:55:05] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:56:34] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m have you checked out the isTrigger property on the event object?
[08:56:43] <duch_kazatel> that might actually contain what you're looking for.
[08:57:27] <duch_kazatel> aaaand bingo - that's exactly what that is.
[08:58:00] <daholby> does running a single page website, using ajax to load all it's content, affect SEO? I imagine it would right?
[08:58:17] <duch_kazatel> daholby it can.
[08:58:38] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: I can't see it, what jQuery version is it?
[08:58:41] <duch_kazatel> daholby make sure those initial requests are serving up the correct, raw markup for the requested page.
[08:59:06] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m anything after 1.7 should have it.
[08:59:37] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m http://jsfiddle.net/5QLMX/
[08:59:38] <daholby> Thanks duch_kazatel could you help me navigate this a little better. I'm very very new to this channel
[08:59:53] <duch_kazatel> daholby i can try :)
[09:00:04] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: "undefined"
[09:00:31] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m which browser are you in?
[09:00:36] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: safari
[09:01:19] <duch_kazatel> wat.  webkit should show 3
[09:01:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5QLMX/1/
[09:01:31] <duch_kazatel> that should work fine.  weird if it doesn't.
[09:01:40] <thomaslindstr_m> ahh
[09:01:45] <thomaslindstr_m> it does now
[09:03:10] <duch_kazatel> cool
[09:03:30] <duch_kazatel> daholby here's some good info about ajax and crawling btw: https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/
[09:03:40] <duch_kazatel> it takes some effort, but it's doable.
[09:05:18] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: sadly it doesn't work when you animate scroll
[09:05:46] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m hrm.  could you share a sample of what you've got?
[09:05:51] <thomaslindstr_m> sure
[09:09:01] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xvIeE
[09:10:02] <duch_kazatel> let me poke at it.  one sec.
[09:15:57] <phelix> Anyone able to help me figure why I am getting this error. http://pastie.org/8730377
[09:17:19] <grafi> phelix include jquery above jquery form
[09:18:32] <phelix> hmm not sure how or where to include this. Sorry jQuery is really new for me.
[09:18:51] <duch_kazatel> thomaslindstr_m http://jsfiddle.net/8xVtt/1/
[09:18:55] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[09:19:14] <duch_kazatel> you could attach a namespace, or trigger a custom event.
[09:20:32] <thomaslindstr_m> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[09:22:01] <duch_kazatel> bummer - i was going to point out that he needed to make sure he added some good comments to explain what he was doing.
[09:23:17] <phelix> grafi: Could you please explain a bit more what you mean?
[09:23:41] <duch_kazatel> one of these days I'll start using my IRL name on IRC.
[09:23:57] <grafi> just switch the script tags around phelix
[09:24:27] <phelix> add type="text/javascript" ?
[09:24:55] <phelix> dont understand what to switch around
[09:25:03] <zumba_addict> I have a question about REST but now sure which channel would be ideal
[09:25:07] <grafi> you take the latter script tag
[09:25:21] <grafi> and move it before the other one
[09:25:42] <phelix> put the google src above the github src ?
[09:25:45] <phelix> ahh
[09:32:54] <lolmaus_> I've got a collection of items: `$items = $('.my-container').children();`. Now i would like to create another item, e. g. `$newItem = $('<div>Foo</div>');`. Do i have to do two things manually: append item  to `.my-container` and add item to $items? Or both can be done i a single step?
[09:34:27] <phelix> grafi: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/ this is what I am using to try and figure out how to submit my form without reloading the page. It still reloading the page when I hit submit. Do you have any idea what could be causing this or know of a good tutorial I could use that could teach me how to accomplish this?
[09:36:36] <bdoherty> phelix, it sounds like the library isn't initializing correctly
[09:36:50] <bdoherty> are you sure it's on the page?
[09:37:14] <bdoherty> are there any other JS errors on the page that could be stopping the library from working?
[09:37:15] <phelix> yes I can view source and see them above the </head> tag
[09:37:25] <phelix> in the console I am not getting a single error
[09:37:37] <duch_kazatel> lolmaus_ $items is a cached representation of that selector, so if you add things to the selector, you have to "re run" the cache
[09:37:48] <phelix> you can see the page here. http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment
[09:38:44] <lolmaus_> duch_kazatel: i assume that doing  `$items = $('.my-container').children();` for the second time is more expensive than `$items.add($newItem);`, is it not?
[09:39:24] <duch_kazatel> the second one might be more performant.  i'd have to set up a test case.
[09:39:25] <bdoherty> phelix, you have a ton of forms on the page, all with the same ID
[09:39:27] <duch_kazatel> and I am lazy.
[09:39:45] <bdoherty> that's no bueno, only one UNIQUE element on the page should have an ID
[09:40:01] <phelix> ahh ok let me fix that up
[09:40:07] <bdoherty> try adding a class on each one of the form elements
[09:40:11] <bdoherty> like "ajax-form" or something
[09:40:27] <bdoherty> and update the selector that inializes the ajax form to ".ajax-form"
[09:40:28] <phelix> does this class have to be unique also?
[09:40:32] <bdoherty> no
[09:40:41] <duch_kazatel> phelix you can reuse a class many times - that's the point.
[09:40:43] <bdoherty> classes can be used multiple times, ID's should only be used once
[09:40:45] <duch_kazatel> IDs can only be on a page once.
[09:40:47] <lolmaus_> duch_kazatel: thank you.
[09:40:52] <duch_kazatel> lolmaus_ sure.
[09:40:59] <phelix> $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() { to $('#myForm').ajax-form(function() { ?
[09:41:37] <phelix> ops i mis read that sorry.
[09:42:08] <bdoherty> $(".ajax-form").ajaxForm()
[09:42:16] <bdoherty> also, it looks like your form elements don't have an action set on them
[09:42:36] <phelix> I want it to submit to the same page
[09:42:36] <bdoherty> so the plugin won't know where to send the data
[09:42:54] <phelix> can it not send to the existing page?
[09:43:27] <bdoherty> you can, it's just kind of weird from an architecture stand point
[09:43:44] <phelix> Well after they submit I want to display the results of that section
[09:43:55] <bdoherty> alright
[09:43:56] <phelix> I wanted todo this without a button but I can't for the life of me get the values of those sliders
[09:44:15] <phelix> only way to get them seems to be to submit as a form
[09:44:25] <duch_kazatel> you can post back to the current page just fine.  postbacks aren't uncommon
[09:46:13] <bdoherty> yeah those inputs are weird
[09:46:17] <bdoherty> for the slider
[09:46:28] <phelix> yes really weird.
[09:46:40] <phelix> the data fills in the input field on the page but it doesn't update inside the html at all
[09:47:03] <duch_kazatel> 5 bucks says shadow dom.
[09:47:06] <phelix> would be awesome to just have it automatically populate the total at the bottom but not sure it can be done with these sliders.
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> which slider are you using
[09:47:31] <phelix> http://nikorablin.com/slideControl/
[09:49:25] <duch_kazatel> yup, those numbers are in the shadow dom.
[09:49:48] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to interface entirely via javascript for those.
[09:49:53] <phelix> yah weird, im to much of a jquery newbie
[09:50:02] <phelix> unless you know of a tutorial that may show how this can be done.
[09:50:04] <duch_kazatel> nah, shadow dom isn't a jquery thing.
[09:51:03] <duch_kazatel> that's not a very featureful slider.  the documentation is lacking, too.
[09:51:10] <bdoherty> what a dumb slider
[09:51:23] <bdoherty> i just looked through the source, doesn't seem like there is a "get the val" method
[09:51:38] <phelix> yah there isn't. not that I could find
[09:51:48] <bdoherty> maybe use jQuery UI's slider instead?
[09:52:04] <phelix> yah maybe i should check that one out
[09:52:11] <bdoherty> I've used it before, and it's got a ton of features, and it's pretty easy to implement
[09:52:14] <duch_kazatel> use noUISlider if you don't want to load all of jqueryui
[09:53:47] <andrewSC> so here's the problem
[09:54:21] <andrewSC> basically I have a bunch of select menus and when one of them changes i need the others to auto change because "defaults"
[09:54:52] <andrewSC> my problem is when i make this change the event handler that's tied to each selectmenu .on('change') fires
[09:55:03] <andrewSC> how do i change the dom without an event firing
[09:55:24] <andrewSC> or, how do i only listen on human interaction and not programmatic change of the dom?
[09:55:30] <duch_kazatel> andrewSC check out event namespacing.
[09:57:28] <petey_> BillCriswell, I fixed it by adding a transparent image over the image map
[09:57:43] <petey_> http://jsbin.com/kibav/12/edit
[09:57:47] <andrewSC> duch_kazatel: i don't see how namespacing solves this problem? I still have to have a listener to 'change' no?
[09:58:12] <duch_kazatel> you have a listener on the namespaced event.
[09:58:18] <duch_kazatel> you can also trigger custom events instead.
[09:58:25] <BillCriswell> petey_: What a brilliant plan. =p
[09:59:51] <duch_kazatel> andrewSC see http://jsfiddle.net/8xVtt/4/
[10:00:20] <naeluh_NSA> hey I have a question is there instance where jquery would run and do nothing cause I am trying to check for visibility and it does nothing is there a way to keep checking over time
[10:01:03] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA huh?
[10:01:47] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA rephrase the question.
[10:04:32] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: ok so I have been using css3 keyframe animations and I was trying to add a class to an id when it was on screen to therefore trigger the animation however when I add the jquery it does not work but when I add the jquery to the console after the fact it says true and triggers it so what would the deal be it seems like it is only running once and at the begining therefor false so...
[10:04:33] <naeluh_NSA> ...I was trying to run it on every div to check some kind of condition like .current-page so the id hasClass .current-page so it should be true but then nothing happens
[10:05:13] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA and your code is in a document ready.
[10:05:16] <duch_kazatel> right?
[10:05:27] <naeluh_NSA> it was window.load
[10:05:51] <duch_kazatel> $(function() {/* your code here*/});
[10:05:52] <duch_kazatel> use that.
[10:05:57] <duch_kazatel> not window.load
[10:06:18] <naeluh_NSA> i tried both neither worked it reall seems like its running once at the begining but I will try that
[10:06:30] <naeluh_NSA> instead of window.load
[10:06:57] <duch_kazatel> document ready runs after the document has loaded.  if you have other code coming in and injecting/preparing things (like a plugin), you have a race condition.
[10:07:20] <naeluh_NSA> ok cool
[10:07:32] <duch_kazatel> kinda like your questions yesterday.
[10:07:57] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: you know me so well at least I know where I am confused haha
[10:08:05] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:08:14] <naeluh_NSA> thanks for the help fo sure
[10:08:21] <duch_kazatel> of course.  s'what i do.
[10:08:26] <duch_kazatel> these were pain points for me at one point.
[10:09:31] <naeluh_NSA> yeah its totally worth it I am making something for this girl for valentines day so hopefully she likes it haha if not oh well I will show what I got when I figure it out
[10:10:14] <naeluh_NSA> but I am sure liking the combo of css3 animation and jquery for conditional elements some reall nice results
[10:11:19] <lonejack> hope this is the right place to ask about jqueryui.... So my question: working 1.10.4. All the widgets have the method "destroy". That is:
[10:11:37] <lonejack> $(selector).widget("destroy")
[10:11:51] <lonejack> to remove the widget completely
[10:12:04] <lonejack> how can I destroy a buttonset?
[10:12:24] <duch_kazatel> from the button widget/
[10:12:55] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jqueryui.com/button/#methods
[10:13:38] <lonejack> duch_kazatel, are you sure it works?
[10:13:54] <duch_kazatel> dunno - I don't use jqueryUI :)
[10:14:20] <duch_kazatel> but if it's in the docs, it likely works.
[10:15:06] <lonejack> duch_kazatel, I'll repeat the test
[10:21:22] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment I am trying this nouislider. Seems partially there. Any idea what I am missing
[10:24:35] <duch_kazatel> open your console and look for yourself, phelix :)
[10:24:48] <phelix> I am not getting any errors in my console.
[10:25:04] <duch_kazatel> I am.
[10:25:18] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/Zdifwqh.png
[10:25:19] <phelix> ahh ok here we go weird. I wasn't before
[10:26:24] <phelix> Well why would slider not be a function? Shouldn't it be created by including the required /js files?
[10:26:44] <duch_kazatel> it's not slider.  it's jquery.
[10:27:42] <phelix> Well why would their examples not be doing it right? Sorry I am pretty new to this
[10:27:54] <phelix> I am doing this how they show in their example page.
[10:27:55] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: I was right it was running once at the beginning then stops so I only get one check then nothing
[10:27:56] <duch_kazatel> and btw your html root node is all wrong.
[10:28:45] <naeluh_NSA> I have a button that triggers the transition maybe I will just bind the condition to that
[10:28:47] <phelix> do some of these scripts need to be called before another one?
[10:28:54] <duch_kazatel> phelix you have some major problems with your markup.
[10:29:21] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA can you give an example in a fiddle?
[10:29:22] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I am running drupal so it does a lot of this
[10:29:49] <naeluh_NSA> let me see real quick
[10:29:57] <duch_kazatel> phelix did you do anything with the html node or anything like that?  check out what's getting rentered.
[10:30:21] <phelix> k let me start there
[10:30:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix but either way, jquery should be loaded before the plugin.
[10:30:45] <duch_kazatel> then all your scripts should be in a document ready.
[10:32:38] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Why do they not give the scripts already in a document ready?
[10:32:58] <duch_kazatel> they do.  yours need to also be in a documnt ready.
[10:32:58] <phelix> if that is how they are supposed to be? How does someone that doesn't know much about jquery like me supposed to know what to put in top of these scripts?
[10:33:12] <duch_kazatel> nonono, not the external ones, the ones you write.
[10:33:20] <Mattx> Hello
[10:33:56] <phelix> ohh like this one? http://www.thecompleteleader.org/sites/www.thecompleteleader.org/themes/completeleader/js/cs.js?n0y64e
[10:34:00] <Mattx> when I do .appendTo("body").draggable() on a div it works, but it's shown on the very end of the page
[10:34:06] <duch_kazatel> phelix exactly.
[10:34:25] <duch_kazatel> Mattx yup.  you're appending it to the body.
[10:34:28] <Mattx> actually .appendTo .draggable .show
[10:34:35] <Mattx> right
[10:34:45] <phelix> I am getting that from here. http://refreshless.com/nouislider/example-keyboard weird they don't show it properly there
[10:35:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix they're assuming you know at least a little about jquery.
[10:35:09] <Mattx> the question is, what if you want it to appear in the middle of the screen? regardless of the scrollbar
[10:35:17] <phelix> I dont think that i need the keypress so i probably just shouldn't even include it
[10:35:30] <duch_kazatel> phelix either document ready OR do it after the html.
[10:35:47] <duch_kazatel> Mattx apply position: fixed to it.
[10:36:48] <phelix>  http://www.thecompleteleader.org/sites/www.thecompleteleader.org/themes/completeleader/js/cs.js
[10:36:53] <phelix> so must be added like so
[10:37:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a smart idea.
[10:37:15] <Mattx> hmn, I thought it only works with position relative
[10:37:17] <Mattx> ok, let me check
[10:37:39] <duch_kazatel> Mattx dunno how draggable works, but position: fixed positions them against the viewport
[10:38:09] <duch_kazatel> Mattx you could add it as the first node in body instead and style it from there.
[10:40:12] <Mattx> never mind, position fixed works
[10:40:12] <ankurk> Is there an easy way to sort date in a table?
[10:40:30] <Mattx> I know why I didn't use it, it's because it wasn't possible to center the div
[10:40:48] <Mattx> but yeah, it does work as expected
[10:40:58] <ankurk> I am currently doing this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8981151
[10:43:22] <ankurk> I don't want to use a plugin for some reason
[10:44:39] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment it seems that I am doing this properly.. any ideas?
[10:45:00] <phelix> getting the document read is not a function
[10:45:53] <duch_kazatel> put your jquery code in a script file and load it like the others.  don't put in in the page.
[10:46:47] <phelix> ok that is done. with cs.js
[10:47:35] <duch_kazatel> also fix your html root node problem.
[10:48:36] <phelix> Not sure how to fix that as most of them are being generated by drupal
[10:48:54] <duch_kazatel> "most of them" - hrm?
[10:49:10] <phelix> well all of them. <?php print $scripts; ?>
[10:49:29] <duch_kazatel> did you change anything with any of that?
[10:49:38] <duch_kazatel> because you currently have an invalid page.
[10:49:39] <phelix> I add my .js files to a .info file
[10:49:45] <phelix> I can change the order of some of these that are loaded
[10:50:01] <duch_kazatel> the .js is going to be problematic until you fix your html tag.
[10:50:18] <duch_kazatel> you currently have two "active" html nodes
[10:51:59] <phelix> ok fixed that
[10:52:33] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i might be able to help with jquery and drupal, but I kind of came in in the middle of your issue :-)
[10:52:46] <duch_kazatel> phelix are do you have noconflict set anywhere?
[10:53:06] <phelix> not sure what noconflict is.
[10:53:18] <phelix> don't think its any type of a drupal function
[10:53:22] <duch_kazatel> Paul_B_Hartzog http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment - phelix is having some issues
[10:53:35] <Paul_B_Hartzog> thx
[10:53:38] <phelix> yes, can't seem to get these sliders working properly.
[10:53:49] <phelix> Trying to implement this inside a drupal site.
[10:54:17] <Paul_B_Hartzog> so you are debugging this error? Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[10:54:24] <duch_kazatel> Paul_B_Hartzog right now, yeah
[10:54:35] <duch_kazatel> the page had two html tags and a TON of plugins on it.
[10:54:49] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:55:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> and you've done this?
[10:55:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
[10:55:45] <phelix> well inside my custom file cs.js I added that yes
[10:55:53] <phelix> ohh not exactly.
[10:56:00] <phelix> i have. $( document ).ready(function() {
[10:56:15] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you can't use $
[10:56:19] <Paul_B_Hartzog> it's a no-conflict issue
[10:56:26] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you need the whole line I posted
[10:56:44] <phelix> yah changed that.
[10:56:47] <phelix> its partially working now lol
[10:56:48] <Paul_B_Hartzog> see here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10807200/jquery-uncaught-typeerror-property-of-object-object-window-is-not-a-funct
[10:56:56] <Paul_B_Hartzog> ignore the WordPress stuff
[10:56:56] <phelix> for one of the sliders anyway
[10:57:20] <Paul_B_Hartzog> no errors in JS console now.  that's good.
[10:57:41] <zirak> loktar: What a coincidence meeting you here!
[10:58:26] <phelix> do I need to put that cs.js script at the bottom of each item? I have it loading in the header right now and it seems that its only working on a single item
[10:58:57] <loktar> zirak: omg dude hey
[10:59:06] <loktar> sorry for ignoring you I was writing jquery plugins
[10:59:21] <zirak> It's been years! How's that jquery girlfriend project going along?
[10:59:38] <loktar> its going alright, its taken a ton of $ but itll all be worth it once I get into her dom
[11:00:23] <zirak> Awesome stuff. Did you fix that weird bug, where it periodically started leaking memory and blood?
[11:00:33] <loktar> haha I wish it still does it once a month
[11:00:38] <loktar> and its not always the same day
[11:00:40] <loktar> its so weird
[11:02:09] <phelix> Paul_B_Hartzog: Yah its working now on a single slide. Any idea why its not on the rest?
[11:02:20] <phelix> I have just set each item to have a unique ID
[11:02:49] <Paul_B_Hartzog> right
[11:02:56] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: I was able a jsbin http://jsbin.com/timep/2/ I think you can see basically what is going
[11:02:57] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i thought i'd let you move forward until you hit a new snag
[11:02:59] <Paul_B_Hartzog> :-)
[11:03:13] <phelix> yah that didn't take me long lol
[11:12:10] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: never mind I got it working
[11:18:10] <ankurk> Hey guys. any easy way than this to sort dates in ascending or descending order? https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8981151
[11:23:54] <phelix> Paul_B_Hartzog: You have an idea on how to get this slider to work on all elements on my page?
[11:24:09] <Paul_B_Hartzog> looking
[11:24:48] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you saw this, right?
[11:24:48] <Paul_B_Hartzog> Uncaught Error: Slider was already initialized.
[11:25:14] <Paul_B_Hartzog> You are using a javascript console to develop, right?
[11:25:24] <Paul_B_Hartzog> to see the errors
[11:25:26] <Paul_B_Hartzog> :-)
[11:26:44] <Paul_B_Hartzog> since the issue is that Slider is already initialized, I'd just google for "multiple sliders" and whatever module or plugin you are working with
[11:27:08] <Paul_B_Hartzog> my guess is that each instance of Slider needs a unique id
[11:27:14] <Paul_B_Hartzog> Slider1, Slider2
[11:27:23] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you can do that programatically or manually
[11:36:42] <phelix> Paul_B_Hartzog: Yes, and I have created a unique ID for each one
[11:36:55] <phelix> and replicated it in hte code below each slider to initialize it
[11:37:15] <Paul_B_Hartzog> make a jsfilddle with just two sliders and i'll take a look
[11:37:44] <phelix> ok
[11:38:07] <Paul_B_Hartzog> btw, kewl sliders
[11:38:41] <phelix> haha, colors will change. Was just playing with the css figuring out how to modify that bg color etc
[12:07:06] <JSON_voorheez> Is there way to get $.param to set an array with one key to a comma separated list?
[12:07:14] <JSON_voorheez> like this... https://pastee.org/n2wyw
[12:11:10] <ddssc> how do I find the first "tr" parent of an element inside a table and set its class?  right now I'm using $("element").parent("tr").addClass("classname") but it's not working.
[12:11:27] <ddssc> the element is a child of tr
[12:11:51] <ddssc> or rather, how do I find the first relative of an element
[12:12:17] <NoiseEee> $(element).closest('tr').addClass('youAreCloseToMeBeMyValentine')
[12:18:09] <skypce> hello again guys
[12:18:52] <skypce> please tell me : http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/bz/  how can i expand hover area to right?
[12:19:22] <curu> hi
[12:19:29] <curu> I would like to know if someone managed to get the ui autocomplete plugin working with bootstrap 3
[12:26:29] <ddssc> want to use .change to catch the "change" event of a checkbox. this works fine if the change happened through user action on the page. however if I change it's state programatically the $(checkbox).change doesn't trigger
[12:27:07] <ddssc> the $(checkbox).change doesn't catch $(checkbox).attr("checked", checked) event
[12:29:50] <Paul_B_Hartzog> gotta bail :-)
[12:30:54] <andrewSC> how do you update the dom without firing a .on('change') event?
[12:30:56] <andrewSC> you can't right?
[12:32:49] <whoisthis> I was wondering if someone would be able to give me some pointers on modifying my code. I am trying to get a popover working. I currently have it displaying on hover, but it is getting generated on hover and does not allow the user to hover over the popover. would like to get the code to generate on pageload instead. Is that the correct way?
[12:54:15] <duch_kazatel> sweet lord it's hot in my office.
[13:00:56] <saml> $('table.data td a');   how can I select only those <table class="data">  where it's not hidden?
[13:01:13] <saml> I have many <table class="data"> but some of them have  style    display: hidden
[13:03:36] <duch_kazatel> $('table.data:visible td a')
[13:03:55] <duch_kazatel> also, if tables are the only things with class data, drop the table part of the selector.
[13:10:08] <MariusIT> hey guys, i need help optimizing this small script http://jsfiddle.net/pmtWn/1/
[13:10:16] <MariusIT> any ideeas?
[13:10:35] <duch_kazatel> what are you otpimizing?
[13:11:24] <duch_kazatel> *optimizing
[13:14:11] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: line 4
[13:17:13] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment I have it themed and working properly now
[13:18:07] <phelix> Well there is a piece of functionality that i am now trying to figure out. How would be the best route to go about calculating the results from this. Once that slider is moved. I want to get the value without re-loading the page. What route should I go to try and acomplish this?
[13:21:04] <duch_kazatel> sorry was away for a sec.
[13:22:07] <duch_kazatel> MariusIT I mean, unless you start attaching IDs or classes to things, that's basically that you can do.  is that not performing very well?
[13:22:33] <duch_kazatel> phelix there should be a "getvalue" method or something.
[13:22:40] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to look at the documentation for the slider
[13:22:49] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: works well, but searching something that's allready selected ....
[13:22:52] <phelix> $("#sample-read").val();
[13:22:58] <phelix> this is all it has on reading values
[13:23:00] <MariusIT> i used alert($(this).attr("title")); instead
[13:23:21] <duch_kazatel> phelix and that doesn't work, or...?
[13:23:30] <duch_kazatel> MariusIT you can also cache selectors.
[13:23:44] <duch_kazatel> var $mySelector = $('#mySelector');
[13:23:44] <phelix> Well, it gets the value of it from when the page just loads which is 0. Its not updating as the slider is updated.
[13:23:47] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Got a minute? I've been working on this project: >http://winningfundraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html< When you begin the game, try clicking the movement arrows. Up and left always seem to work, but right and down have problems regardless of my approach. Is there anything in this code block that you can see is causing it? >http
[13:23:47] <pom_life> ://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/fQk6s/<
[13:23:50] <duch_kazatel> that saves you a lookup.
[13:24:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix ah.  bind to the click or change event.
[13:24:24] <duch_kazatel> pom_life I'll try to help in a minute :)
[13:24:36] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Take your time~
[13:25:27] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/8731112
[13:25:30] <phelix> that is what i was trying
[13:25:35] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: thanks for the tip, but every selector has it's own message, won't work
[13:26:35] <duch_kazatel> MariusIT hrm.  i'd store that data elsehwere so you don't have to do a lookup through the DOM all the time, but who know.
[13:26:44] <duch_kazatel> phelix and is that alerting, or are you getting errors?
[13:27:03] <phelix> no errors and no alert
[13:27:31] <phelix> does it appear that I am doing it correctly?
[13:27:37] <duch_kazatel> phelix do a console.log($('#<?=$uid?>'));
[13:27:51] <duch_kazatel> phelix not really - you're dynamically generating javascript which usually points ot problems.
[13:28:10] <duch_kazatel> you should be using static values, like classes, and binding to those instead of dynamically generating things.
[13:28:25] <phelix> not sure its possible with how this is setup
[13:28:39] <phelix> i have to work within the way drupal does things
[13:28:45] <phelix> Object[div#sample-change-keypress-666.noUi-target]
[13:28:51] <duch_kazatel> so?  you can attach IDs or Calsses to things, right?
[13:28:53] <phelix> this is the result from console
[13:29:12] <phelix> Well where this is being done is a couple template files its not all done in a single page
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> phelix you should have one javascript file.
[13:29:53] <duch_kazatel> for your handrolled stuff.
[13:30:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah you're really overcomplicating this setup.
[13:30:36] <duch_kazatel> see the error about " Slider was already initialized."
[13:31:20] <phelix> duch_kazatel: yes that is because it duplicates an ID as it goes down the page more. I know how to resove it but just fixed it for as far as the sliders are going down the page now. Was gonna try to get what I have working first then fix it for the rest of the items
[13:31:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix bind to a class instead of dynamically generated IDs.
[13:31:55] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I can't have just one .js file because it needs to be generated and match each ID for every slider
[13:31:55] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're going to have headaches.
[13:32:01] <phelix> ahh
[13:32:05] <duch_kazatel> then you're doing something wrong.
[13:32:08] <phelix> didn't know you could do that
[13:32:10] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[13:32:40] <duch_kazatel> if you're generating JS, you're doing it wrong, basically.
[13:33:39] <dkphenom> anyone know a responsive jquery slider that would help me achieve this effect: http://coolcarousels.frebsite.nl/c/2/, with a truncated next & previous slides?
[13:34:03] <duch_kazatel> bxslider is my go-to slider.
[13:35:45] <dkphenom> @duch_kazatel, can't seem to get it done in bxslider :/
[13:38:36] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I almost have it with just that single cs.js file. But I am not getting the data to populate inside the input field anymore
[13:38:40] <phelix> any ideas?
[13:39:09] <krz> find('input[name=foo]') works if the name of the input is foo. what if the name is foo[bar]
[13:39:15] <krz> how can i get the selector to work?
[13:39:52] <Kotarou> I am searching for a jQuery or JS plugin that enables a swiping gesture on mobile devices. I am not very keen on using jQuery Mobile, due to it's weight, hence I ask: Are there any decent alternatives?
[13:41:14] <pom_life> what a day
[13:41:36] <krz> anyone?
[13:42:08] <Kotarou> krz why would you give the input a property of name=foo[bar]?
[13:42:27] <NoiseEee> Kotarou: why not?
[13:42:53] <Kotarou> NoiseEee Why not foo-bar?
[13:43:09] <NoiseEee> perhaps he's processing foo on the backend where bar represents different types of foo
[13:43:17] <krz> well said
[13:43:23] <NoiseEee> fubar
[13:44:25] <phelix> duch_kazatel: You still around?
[13:44:34] <Kotarou> With a small function it would also be possible to convert foo-bar to foo[bar] however
[13:45:06] <duch_kazatel> sorry, I'm at work and getting pulled aside
[13:45:16] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/75CBx/ @ krz
[13:45:29] <phelix> its all good. I am using a single .js file now and when I move the slider it changes the input value everywhere
[13:45:42] <phelix> it seems each item needs to be unique for this to work properly.
[13:46:25] <duch_kazatel> you might have to do manually enumerate through the elements on the page and init that way.
[13:46:47] <phelix> uggh, this is probably way beyond my skill level..
[13:47:04] <phelix> Might be better to have it how I was doing it. That way seemed to work just fine
[13:47:11] <duch_kazatel> not really - .each()
[13:47:28] <duch_kazatel> your real issue is you're trying to do things without actually understand what you're doing.
[13:48:00] <remaxerdeviator> If you would like to accept a challenge, download Candy Invasion on Play Store and TRY to beat the highscore of 3150
[13:48:13] <phelix> I understand most of it. Some pieces are still vauge. But im super new with jquery. and I don't have enough time to learn jquery before I complete this project. I mean I am learning a ton
[13:48:53] <NoiseEee> remaxerdeviator: fuck off already. you shouldn't need to be told twice.
[13:49:11] <remaxerdeviator> NoiseEee: Sorry
[13:49:19] <duch_kazatel> remaxerdeviator wtf don't spam.
[13:49:20] <NoiseEee> don't Sorry, quit spamming as you've been told multiple times.
[13:49:21] <remaxerdeviator> I did not know I already posted it on this channel
[13:49:23] <duch_kazatel> what's your problem?
[13:49:32] <remaxerdeviator> Sorry
[13:49:34] <remaxerdeviator> I did not know
[13:49:37] <remaxerdeviator> It is not spam
[13:49:43] <NoiseEee> it is entirely spam. enough.
[13:49:44] <remaxerdeviator> I am not spamming anything
[13:49:51] <NoiseEee> its entirely off topic.
[13:49:53] <remaxerdeviator> Anyway I am sorry
[13:50:00] <duch_kazatel> yes yopu are.  you are going to each channel and pushing your crappy game.
[13:50:10] <phelix> duch_kazatel: How would I go about adding this .each into my .js?
[13:50:21] <remaxerdeviator> duch_kazatel: I am just promoting
[13:50:26] <remaxerdeviator> duch_kazatel: as everyone would do
[13:50:37] <duch_kazatel> you are spamming and are all ready being reported for working against the rules for the network
[13:50:52] <krz> NoiseEee: theres a cleaner solution
[13:50:54] <duch_kazatel> phelix https://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:51:01] <krz> i rmemeber doing this quite a while ago
[13:51:07] <krz> theres no need to escape like that
[13:53:45] <mariuscc> what does .unbind('focus.validation') mean ?
[13:54:10] <duch_kazatel> unbind any event handlers for focus.validation
[13:54:22] <NoiseEee> krz: pretty sure thats the solution, but if not, please followup fiddle
[13:55:09] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://www.thecompleteleader.org/sites/www.thecompleteleader.org/themes/completeleader/js/cs.js?n0yezu ?
[13:55:25] <mariuscc> duch_kazatel: for focus.validation is a selector ?
[13:55:44] <mariuscc> shouldnt be event type ?
[13:55:46] <duch_kazatel> mariuscc no, focus.validation is the event
[13:56:37] <duch_kazatel> phelix go read the docs again, but I don't have time any more to dump through your javascript =/
[13:57:20] <phelix> duch_kazatel: k, could you just please then before your done give me a sudgestion on how I would gather the values of those sliders after they have been adjusted?
[13:57:42] <duch_kazatel> which slider are you using?
[13:57:52] <phelix> noUiSlider
[13:58:16] <duch_kazatel> http://refreshless.com/nouislider/reading-values
[13:58:30] <phelix> yes I have made it that far.
[13:58:50] <phelix> But it displays 0 as the slider hasn't been changed yet. Need to figure out how to get the value after the slider has been moved.
[13:59:19] <duch_kazatel> $('.slider').on('change', function(){$(this).val()});
[13:59:27] <duch_kazatel> that event might be wrong though.
[13:59:37] <duch_kazatel> change .slider to whatever class you've given your sliders.
[13:59:47] <phelix> ok, let me play with that. thank you for your help
[13:59:52] <ZeuZ> to match an id equaling "test" all I've got to do is $("#test").on("click",function(){alert ("this item"); }); right?
[14:00:02] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ yep
[14:00:08] <stongo> anyone had any problems with jQuery 1.10.2 and IE8 ?
[14:00:38] <stongo> console logs 'jQuery is undefined' and 'bootstrap requires jQuery', etc
[14:01:02] <stongo> but I confirmed it's loading the jQuery script
[14:01:22] <duch_kazatel> stongo make those scripts are getting loaded after jquery
[14:01:24] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, it's weird, I've got that code, and this html: http://codepad.org/w9yB74Li --> and not even through firebug can I make it work
[14:01:58] <ZeuZ> (replace test with botonDescargar)
[14:02:20] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ because you're trying to bind an event handler before the element exists.  wrap your code in a document ready, like $(function(){/* your code here */});
[14:03:06] <ZeuZ> come again? something akin to if(document.ready) { /* code? */ }
[14:03:24] <ZeuZ> ?
[14:03:35] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ literally put $(function(){ before your code in that js file, and }); after
[14:05:11] <stongo> duch_kazatel: jQuery is the first script added
[14:05:23] <ZeuZ> is that the jQuery way? didn't see that in w3c school, sorry to be asking this
[14:09:41] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ w3schools is terrible and bad.  that's a shorthand for $( document ).ready(function() {});
[14:11:28] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: image editor off the top of your head similar to paint, free, with transparency?
[14:12:15] <duch_kazatel> paint.net
[14:12:20] <pom_life> thats right
[14:16:39] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Got a second now? I don't have any issues at the moment I need help with, but it'd be rad if you check out my progress so far. Try running into the laser, then try triggering the switch to turn the laser off. For now you have to refresh on death. >http://winningfundraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html<

[14:59:19] <dw0rd> I am having an issue with the datepicker. It keeps leaving the previous selected year in the text field everytime you select a new date. http://jsfiddle.net/TW7hU/
[14:59:24] <dw0rd> I would greatly appreciate some assistnace
[15:00:15] <dw0rd> The fiddle is very easy, it has like 2 lines of code XD
[15:03:22] <BillCriswell> dw0rd: yy-mm-dd seems to work
[15:03:35] <BillCriswell> Why it's just yy I have no idea.
[15:03:40] <dw0rd> strange
[15:04:06] <duch_kazatel> yy = 4 digit year iirc.
[15:04:13] <duch_kazatel> you're saying "do the year twice"
[15:04:27] <BillCriswell> I was thinking of it as YYYY-mm-dd
[15:04:44] <BillCriswell> dw0rd: It is documented with yy-mm-dd though
[15:04:50] <BillCriswell> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[15:05:01] <duch_kazatel> yy is the 4 digit
[15:05:05] <dw0rd> Ohhhhh
[15:05:15] <dw0rd> that is not cool, but cool you made me aware of it
[15:05:43] <duch_kazatel> api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate
[15:05:48] <duch_kazatel> there are your formats
[15:06:14] <dw0rd> thanks BillCriswell duch_kazatel

[15:18:32] <bashusr> what does $(function() { }) syntax mean?
[15:18:56] <BillCriswell> bashusr: Just short for $(document).ready(function(){ ... });
[15:18:58] <bashusr> i thought $() was a selector, how can you have a closure in there like that?
[15:19:44] <BillCriswell> $() can do a bunch of shit.
[15:20:07] <bashusr> amazing
[15:20:42] <bashusr> so how do i debug if it isn't working? I have a simple $(function() { alert("hello world"); }); and it isn't running the alert
[15:20:42] <BillCriswell> If it's passed a function I guess it just takes it as wait for the focument to be ready and do that.
[15:21:13] <BillCriswell> bashusr: You probably don't have jQuery included.
[15:22:11] <BillCriswell> bashusr: http://jsbin.com/zuxog/1/edit?html,js,output
[15:23:12] <bashusr> BillCriswell, yeah, i know it works
[15:23:16] <bashusr> i've used it a bunch of times before
[15:23:29] <bashusr> but it's like at the moment the code is there, jquery isn't
[15:23:50] * bashusr playing around with backbone.js and a bunch of other libraries 
[15:24:01] <bashusr> i don't know if something is killing $
[15:24:17] <duch_kazatel> what other libraries?
[15:24:28] <BillCriswell> Try jQuery(function(){ alert('Yo'); }); Could just be a conflict.
[15:27:14] <bashusr> nope, i just did a console.log($), and it spit out the jquery function
[15:27:32] <bashusr> duch_kazatel, backbone and underscore
[15:29:25] <BillCriswell> Would need to see some code at this point haha.
[15:29:53] <duch_kazatel> you said "a bunch of other libraries" and then listed two.  i am confused :(
[15:31:29] <bashusr> duch_kazatel, yeah, i disabled 'em all, nvm :)
[15:31:42] <bashusr> BillCriswell, yeah, i'm ok, it's complicated
[15:31:59] <bashusr> i'm also using symfony on the backend and stitching together all these libraries using a twig templating system
[15:32:02] <BillCriswell> Fuck yes. THUNDERSNOW
[15:45:36] <krisek101> hi
[15:47:31] <pom_life> for arrow keys, should I use keydown() or keypress()?
[15:47:46] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[15:47:56] <pom_life> I know
[15:48:03] <pom_life> .on('keydown'? or 'keypress'?
[15:48:29] <duch_kazatel> keydown.
[15:48:47] <krisek101> Could you tell me, how to add html code do jquery? I want to use append() and inside it i want put html code.
[15:49:02] <duch_kazatel> $('<div>some text</div>')
[15:49:11] <duch_kazatel> feed it a string, done.
[15:49:20] <duch_kazatel> creates a fragment and everything for you, evem
[15:49:22] <duch_kazatel> *evem
[15:49:43] <ZeuZ> If I need to get the URL I'm in, whereas what's important is the variable name like for example from test.php?important_value=important_data, will $(location).attr('pathname') show it?
[15:50:05] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:50:19] <BillCriswell> krisek101: .append('<div>THUNDERSNOW</div>')
[15:50:28] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ are you looking for the url of the current page?
[15:50:30] <krisek101> I did as you say
[15:50:36] <krisek101> http://jsfiddle.net/6DQJX/
[15:51:17] <duch_kazatel> krisek101 you have mismatches on your quotes.
[15:51:29] <duch_kazatel> that needs ot be one big like.
[15:51:59] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, yeah, the current URL
[15:52:13] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ you want window.location.href
[15:52:27] <ZeuZ> .attr('href') ?
[15:52:36] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:52:42] <duch_kazatel> window.location.href is the current URL.
[15:52:55] <ZeuZ> ain't there a "jQuery way?"
[15:53:05] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[15:53:11] <BillCriswell> krisek101: http://jsfiddle.net/6DQJX/1/ one line.
[15:53:16] <duch_kazatel> i mean, it's totally unnecessary.
[15:53:35] <ZeuZ> It's just to keep it consistent with the use of the framework
[15:54:01] <duch_kazatel> .attr() is to grab an attribute from a node
[15:54:24] <duch_kazatel> the window location is not a node.
[15:54:58] <duch_kazatel> there is no "jquery way" to do it because that's kind of an absurd idea.
[15:55:07] <krisek101> ahh, so  it all have to be in one line?
[15:55:19] <krisek101> Thank you so much
[15:55:50] <duch_kazatel> krisek101 you can split it up if you surround each line with qutoes and slap a + at the end of all but the last line.
[15:55:59] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, thanks!
[15:56:00] <BillCriswell> Yeah. You can do like "Something" + then a new line then more "stuff" but You can't have a new line inside the quotes.
[15:57:26] <krisek101> :Dok, now I understand:D
[16:00:58] <upsidedownhug> #mysql
[16:01:07] <upsidedownhug> oops lol
[16:03:03] <pom_life> BillCriswell: You in a spot where you can safely hear audio?
[16:05:54] <BillCriswell> I can in a bit. Jeopardy is on haha
[16:08:18] <pom_life> BillCriswell: The gist of the issue is that doing certain things causes a sound effect to occur. Right now, to activate that effect, I'm using $('body').append("<audio></audio>"); This works, but because the browser has to load the file it's delayed. When I step on the secret tile, it plays the "tilestep" sound effect about a second too late.
[16:08:46] <pom_life> Is there a better way to do it? Maybe preload the sound effect and "enable" it when necessary? disabled doesn't work on <audio>
[16:10:33] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Are you adding the element every time?
[16:11:19] <pom_life> BillCriswell: On certain events I'm adding the element. Ideally, I'd have all the possible sound effects on the page onLoad, and then play them one by one when needed. That way, they execute immediately instead of having to be loaded.
[16:12:50] <BillCriswell> You could do: var step = new Audio('tile.wav'); then when you want to play it just do step.play()
[16:13:33] <pom_life> Audio is a built in object? is 'tile.wave' the relative path of the sound effect?
[16:13:59] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[16:16:33] <cheebamba> Hi, how do i check if checkbox is checked ? Ive tried so far: .is(':checked')   .prop('checked')     .checked     and nothing works -it always true or always false :(
[16:17:09] <BillCriswell> cheebamba: All of those ( besides .checked ) should work.
[16:17:39] <BillCriswell> cheebamba: Are you testing at the right time?
[16:17:58] <cheebamba> BillCriswell: what do you mean ?
[16:18:10] <christophe_v_e> Hey, I'm using columnizer: http://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/ - it works on my demo but I can't seem to get it to work on my live site, I was wondering if anybody could take a look and see if anything is conflicting ..  It works fine stripped to the bare minimum. http://www.efnweb.be/?page_id=5126
[16:18:56] <cheebamba> BillCriswell: nvm i think i got it XD

[16:23:42] <pom_life> oh
[16:28:31] <BillCriswell> Movie time. Night!
[16:44:45] <solucien> hey .. is there such thing as a scroll spy in native jQuery?
[16:44:57] <duch_kazatel> that's a plugin.
[16:46:56] <cheebamba> Why this doesnt alert ? http://jsbin.com/megot/6/edit
[16:47:15] <cheebamba> nvm
[16:47:16] <cheebamba> fixed XD
[16:49:32] <bradix14> Somehow the jQuery Mobile CSS scripts are changing all my hrefs to #.  Anyone heard of this?  When I disable the CSS, the links work. When the CSS is applied all the hrefs turn to # when I view source

[16:52:32] <bashusr> does anyone know if i can do DOM manipulation on an underscore template?
[17:01:41] <bashusr> can you use jquery to edit html within a javascript variable?
[17:02:59] <bashusr> ie. html='<div><ul id="collection"></ul></div>'; and then select the #collection id and append some html such as <ul id="collection"><li>Test</li><li>Test 2</li> </ul> ?
[17:04:38] <duch_kazatel> bashusr that's not "html in a javascript variable",  that's just text.
[17:05:11] <duch_kazatel> to more succinctly answer your question, no.  not unless you do something like $myHTML = $('<div><ul id="collection"></ul></div>');
[17:05:24] <duch_kazatel> you can then interact with $myHTML like you normally would since it's in a fragment.
[17:05:36] <bashusr> duch_kazatel, i'm a tad bit confused, how can i tell if i have a fragment or just text?
[17:05:46] <bashusr> it looks the same when i look at it in console.log()
[17:05:50] <duch_kazatel> does it look like what you posted, or what I posted?
[17:05:55] <duch_kazatel> the declaration part, I mean.
[17:06:18] <bashusr> duch_kazatel, i used underscore template to create this variable
[17:06:41] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember if underscore templates are fragments or not.
[17:07:01] <bashusr> template:_.template($("#main-catalog-template").html()),
[17:07:32] <bashusr> and in my render, i want to attach a backbone.js view to the template
[17:07:37] <duch_kazatel> THAT is a fragment
[17:08:23] <bashusr> ok, great, now how can i attach anything to it?
[17:08:35] <bashusr> all my operations on the fragment dissapear when i try to append it to anything
[17:09:24] <duch_kazatel> oh wait, that's not a fragment, my bad.
[17:09:31] <duch_kazatel> i'm actually not familiar with underscore templates at all.
[17:09:39] <coderego> Hey guys, I am trying to select a grand child by ID. Like this: $("tr.edit_e_tr #amount_input_"+ID).show();
[17:09:42] <coderego> is that correct?
[17:10:59] <bashusr> coderego, try it, and if it don't work, then you probably have to show us some code
[17:11:13] <bashusr> coderego, off the back of my hand, nothing looks wrong with it
[17:11:25] <coderego> bashusr: okay. let me publish..
[17:11:39] <duch_kazatel> coderego wait, you're trying to select something by ID?
[17:12:19] <duch_kazatel> ah, i get it.
[17:12:38] <coderego> http://pastebin.com/RmcEk8Ua
[17:13:15] <coderego> duch_kazatel: im trying to select by ID if its a specific grand child. I have TWO forms. the first form is selecting just based on the ID--works perfect. Second form--the IDs may be the same so I want to differentiate. Renamed the class.
[17:13:36] <duch_kazatel> coderego you can just select the ID directly, since IDs are unique.
[17:13:50] <coderego> duch_kazatel: the ID wont be unique as I have two differnt forms at the same time
[17:14:08] <duch_kazatel> coderego then your page is invalid.
[17:14:13] <duch_kazatel> IDs can only occur once per page.
[17:14:21] <duch_kazatel> if you have more than one, you'll have problems.
[17:14:23] <coderego> duch_kazatel: yes...this is a good point. the problem is i have multiple in the dbase lol
[17:14:47] <coderego> duch_kazatel: you gave me an idea, i think i can solve it. thanks
[17:18:10] <duch_kazatel> i am the rubber duck of #jquery these days.
[17:18:29] <coderego> rubber duck?
[17:20:30] <duch_kazatel> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[17:21:14] <bashusr> what's the convention for using $ and not using it?
[17:21:22] <bashusr> i'm a bit confused why i randomly see $ in variables
[17:21:48] <bashusr> i understand it is the jquery superfunction, but i don't know why sometimes we have $el and sometimes it is just vars
[17:22:48] <pom_life> $ is a function
[17:22:50] <duch_kazatel> bashusr lots of folks prepend vars with $ when they hold jquery objects.
[17:22:55] <duch_kazatel> so it's easy to see what's what.
[17:23:08] <pom_life> Yeah. I always set $VariableName = $('#VariableName');
[17:23:22] <pom_life> instead of var VariableName = #('#VariableName');
[17:23:32] <duch_kazatel> that way you can do myNode = $('.aNodeSet')[0];
[17:23:41] <duch_kazatel> because myNode in that case is NOT a jquery object.
[17:24:06] <bashusr> thanks guys
[17:24:09] <bashusr> i got to get used to this
[17:24:24] <bashusr> js is too magical ;-)
[17:24:34] <pom_life> js is average. jq is magical :]
[17:24:40] <bashusr> and so loose
[17:24:58] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: You see my question earlier?
[17:34:16] <duch_kazatel> sorry, was lolling at coldfusion and its idiocy
[17:35:17] <duch_kazatel> pom_life sorry I did not.  what's up?
[17:35:34] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: > http://winningfundraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html <  When completing the first level, notice the RoomGrid fades out and the LevelComplete image fades in. Any idea why it loads a thousand + times? Here's the code for it. > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/8mVNB/ <
[17:37:05] <duch_kazatel> how do I complete the first level again?
[17:37:38] <pom_life> the space at [7][1] is a tile you step on to stop the laser
[17:38:44] <duch_kazatel> woah that crashed firefox.
[17:39:16] <duch_kazatel> so the first question is why you feel the need to run that in an interval like that?
[17:39:16] <pom_life> ._.
[17:39:46] <duch_kazatel> instead, check position after the user clicked an arrow.
[17:40:00] <pom_life> but each level is different
[17:40:12] <pom_life> if i hardcode it into the movement, it'll only work for a specific level
[17:40:54] <pom_life> as it is, I have each interval (doorInterval, switchInterval, laserInterval) check user position and perform an action every 250ms
[17:41:12] <pom_life> and eahc level layout is a different case in currentGame.levelLayout();
[17:41:14] <duch_kazatel> imo create a function that handles passing of a level globally, and then create handling for a win condition based on an actual event, instead of a timer.
[17:43:00] <pom_life> I'll look into that. In the meantime, do you know why it doesn't self-terminate once getting a "hit"? Logically, the interval should clear itself as soon as the user's position is at [0][4];'
[17:43:07] <vinex08> yoh guys,, any good links that will teach me how to create a basic content slider? no plugins..
[17:43:21] <vinex08> i want to fully understand how it works
[17:43:28] <pom_life> the jQuery track on codecademy goes over that
[17:43:28] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 it's pretty simple in practice.
[17:44:17] <duch_kazatel> pom_life so in that fiddle, I'm seeing it's running a bunch of checks over and over - do you ever terminate that timer when the level passes?
[17:44:31] <vinex08> duch_kazatel: do you have a fiddle for that?
[17:44:44] <vinex08> maybe can you create one .. with comments?
[17:44:54] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 lol not in my spare time.  but think about it.
[17:45:29] <vinex08> spare a few minutes :)
[17:45:52] <vinex08> it doesnt have to be good looking, as long as the functionality is there..
[17:46:03] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: under the if condition, it checks if the user's position is [0][4]. If it is, it appends the Level Complete image, removes the background music, logs to console that the level is finished and > clearInterbal(doorInterval) < , which is the interval this exists within.
[17:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 1: if I write it myself, you won't write it yourself and learn.  2: i'm at work ;)
[17:46:18] <vinex08> because right now i always rely on plugins, such as flexslide or bxsliders
[17:46:40] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 try starting from the beginning and step through it.
[17:47:15] <duch_kazatel> pom_lifeare you might want to makje sure those conditions are getting met with an alert(),  or use a breakpoint.
[17:49:28] <vinex08> what do you mean from the beginning?
[17:49:42] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 what's the first thing you'd do? then go from thre.
[17:49:52] <tebrkwn> Hello
[17:50:11] <vinex08> ok ill create the html and css for you :)
[17:50:25] <tebrkwn> I need some help with jQuery. I have a jsFiddle
[17:50:32] <duch_kazatel> !ask
[17:50:32] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:50:40] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ tebrkwn
[17:50:40] <b-ot> tebrkwn: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:50:48] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 start with that, then do the javascript.
[17:51:51] <tebrkwn> I'm having trouble with an active class and scrolling problem. Here is the jsFiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/251/ - basically I want the 2 dots within the red to be the opposite but still act the same.
[17:52:07] <tebrkwn> Could someone help me on the above problem?
[17:54:30] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: what do you mean "be the opposite but still act the same" ?
[17:55:11] <tebrkwn> Like I want them to act the same but be different colors if that makes sense?
[17:55:45] <tebrkwn> On white background it's ok because it's red and grey but when it's on the red background You can only see the grey...
[17:56:24] <Velveeta> so the one that's currently red on a red background, what color do you want it to be when it's active?
[17:56:24] <tebrkwn> You know what i mean?
[17:56:28] <pom_life> What's a common way to check if a div has an element with a certain id in it?
[17:56:30] <Velveeta> yeah i think so
[17:56:39] <tebrkwn> I want that to be white
[17:56:48] <Velveeta> pom_life: you can do $('your div').find('#yourId').length
[17:57:02] <tebrkwn> With the other circle light red.
[17:58:02] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: you can use css selector specificity to override that style and apply your new one: http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/252/
[17:58:14] <Velveeta> create a rule for #portfolio .active { background-color: #fff; }
[17:58:25] <Velveeta> so it only affects .active elements inside of the #portfolio element
[17:59:34] <tebrkwn> Ok i'll try that
[17:59:50] <Velveeta> i already made the change for you in that jsfiddle link above
[18:00:17] <tebrkwn> Will take a look
[18:00:44] <vinex08> duch_kazatel: does it have to be a list?
[18:00:48] <Velveeta> look to the very bottom of the css pane
[18:00:51] <tebrkwn> How can i make the grey circle in the red to be a light red
[18:01:09] <tebrkwn> this color to be exact: #fb474d
[18:02:57] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: let me take a look
[18:03:06] <tebrkwn> Thanks
[18:04:25] <Velveeta> you'd want to use a similar method to what i just showed you, but instead of targeting .active, you'd probably want to just target .circle
[18:04:48] <Velveeta> and you should put it before the rule that targets .active, so the .active background color will take precedence
[18:05:01] <tebrkwn> red on red should be white
[18:05:09] <tebrkwn> woops*
[18:05:32] <tebrkwn> Ahh yup that might be it
[18:05:37] <Velveeta> css will look at selector specificity first, and take whatever is the most specific... when dealing with items of the same specificity, it takes whichever one comes last
[18:06:00] <tebrkwn> Yup that works
[18:06:02] <tebrkwn> Although
[18:06:11] <tebrkwn> When I press RUN the red circle doesnt show until i scroll?
[18:06:12] <Velveeta> so #portfolio .active and #portfolio .circle are the same specificity, #id .className... so when a circle is also active, you want that rule to come last so it uses the active background-color
[18:06:13] <duch_kazatel> all right, off to home.
[18:06:18] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks
[18:06:38] <tebrkwn> Yup got you
[18:06:49] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: that's because you have that active class bound to a scroll event
[18:07:05] <tebrkwn> So what would I need to change?
[18:07:16] <Velveeta> if you want that to fire immediately, you could trigger scroll immediately, once, just to set the classes
[18:07:35] <tebrkwn> What if i put active inside the class
[18:07:48] <Velveeta> what do you mean?
[18:10:07] <tebrkwn> I put active within the class of html
[18:10:18] <tebrkwn> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/253/
[18:28:08] <pom_life> Velveeta: Interested in seeing what I've been working on these last few hours?
[18:33:51] <Velveeta> pom_life: sure, wanna send me a link?
[18:34:51] <tebrkwn> I'll be keen to see too
[18:36:02] <pom_life> http://winningfundraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html
[18:40:33] <Velveeta> looking pretty good, you seem to have some event listener stacking going on when game over hits
[18:40:39] <Velveeta> so it's doubling and tripling up your listeners
[18:40:46] <Velveeta> but it's getting there :)
[18:40:54] <pom_life> yeah I know how to fix those
[18:40:58] <pom_life> just a matter of doing it. lol
[18:41:22] <Velveeta> heheheh
[18:41:34] <pom_life> This stuff is so addicting. I started this project about 24 hours ago, and I've already put 14~ hours into it
[18:41:56] <Velveeta> i made it to level 2
[18:42:19] <pom_life> that's all there is for now :) I've done the main work on the engine primarily. Adding new levels is as simple as adding a "mini module"
[18:42:30] <Velveeta> pom_life: yeah, i still find this stuff to be addictive, not game development, but in my case it's ui components
[18:42:33] <pom_life> I had to do the music, sound effects and art too
[18:42:38] <Velveeta> programming in general gets addictive :)
[18:42:52] <pom_life> yeah. I can definitely see myself doing any kind of programming for a living
[18:42:56] <pom_life> days pass so fast
[18:43:25] <Velveeta> yeah, i always wanted to do programming, but went to school for network administration, and did that for close to 3 years before i was able to transition into development
[18:43:31] <tebrkwn> Velveeta
[18:43:40] <Velveeta> and now i've been doing development for close to a decade, and absolutely love my job
[18:43:43] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: yassir?
[18:43:47] <tebrkwn> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/254/
[18:43:50] <tebrkwn> Problem
[18:44:03] <tebrkwn> When you click that first grey circle within the white container
[18:44:34] <tebrkwn> it will take you to red, yes, but when you click the left circle within the red and it takes you back to top.
[18:44:45] <tebrkwn> both circles are grey...
[18:47:21] <pom_life> I need to tighten up the graphics on level 3... anyone got a playstation controller?
[18:50:44] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: part of your problem is that you're misusing id attributes
[18:50:56] <Velveeta> id's have to be unique in the document, only 1 element should have any given id
[18:51:06] <Velveeta> i see multiple #menu-center elements
[18:51:14] <Velveeta> that should be a class instead of an id
[18:52:25] <tebrkwn> Would you be able to edit?
[18:58:32] <tebrkwn> Any luck?
[19:06:07] <nahtnam> Hey! I need some help! I am using bootstrap 3.1.0. I put some alerts on my site and was wondering how I could make it "expire" or "time out"
[19:06:13] <tebrkwn> velveeta
[19:06:29] <Velveeta> i'm here
[19:06:47] <Velveeta> that's not something i can edit, because i don't know where all you have duplicate id's in your markup, and i don't want to dig through all of it to find them
[19:07:00] <tebrkwn> In the jsFiddle?
[19:07:03] <Velveeta> so you need to go through and change any duplicate id's to be classes instead, or else make them unique
[19:07:04] <Velveeta> yep
[19:07:15] <tebrkwn> There aint that much HTML
[19:07:18] <Velveeta> and then go through the css and alter any styles that might be tied to those ids, to use class selectors instead
[19:07:34] <Velveeta> and then go through the code and update the id selectors that were pointing to duplicates, and make them point to classes instead
[19:07:36] <tebrkwn> I'm confused as to what you mean
[19:08:27] <Velveeta> i mean if you have 2 elements with id="menu-center", you need to either change them to id="menu-center1" and id="menu-center2" or else make them class="menu-center" instead
[19:08:45] <Velveeta> and the same would go for any other elements where you have duplicate id's
[19:09:36] <tebrkwn> I see.
[19:09:48] <tebrkwn> I changed them to classes instead
[19:09:56] <tebrkwn> Still no luck
[19:12:53] <Velveeta> send me an updated link to the latest fiddle
[19:17:07] <tebrkwn> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/255/
[19:17:13] <tebrkwn> I took it back a few steps.
[19:17:16] <tebrkwn> ^^
[19:17:19] <tebrkwn> ^^^
[19:20:12] <Velveeta> looks like it's working to me
[19:20:28] <tebrkwn> There's a couple of errors
[19:20:31] <nahtnam> Hey! I need some help! I am using bootstrap 3.1.0. I put some alerts on my site and was wondering how I could make it "expire" or "time out"
[19:21:03] <tebrkwn> When you press the second circle within the white container
[19:21:08] <nahtnam> nevermind
[19:21:09] <nahtnam> I got it
[19:21:26] <tebrkwn> then press the first circle. It will take you back to top and the circles are both grey.
[19:21:55] <Velveeta> when i did it, it behaved as it should, it had the first circle set as active
[19:23:15] <tebrkwn> You sure?
[19:23:21] <tebrkwn> Sometimes it doesn't
[19:23:38] <Velveeta> seems to work for me
[19:23:50] <Velveeta> can you find a reproducible way of making it not work?
[19:23:58] <tebrkwn> Try it a couple of times and it wont!
[19:24:11] <tebrkwn> Not really.
[19:27:25] <tebrkwn> Velveeta
[19:27:33] <tebrkwn> Ok i can see why it's not working sometimes
[19:28:07] <tebrkwn> If you run/refresh and press the active red button first and THEN the second circle, which will take you to the red.
[19:28:19] <tebrkwn> Then press the first circle and it will take you back to top
[19:28:22] <tebrkwn> Both are grey.
[19:29:22] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: what's the purpose of your onScroll function?
[19:29:57] <Velveeta> this may have something to do with the way you're on/off'ing your scroll events, and i'm not sure that scroll events are even necessary here
[19:30:07] <tebrkwn> The onScroll function checks whether the scroll has reached that id.
[19:30:43] <tebrkwn> So for example if I reach the id #portfolio it will then change those circles
[19:31:15] <tebrkwn> The reason i want the function is so that they change when you pass the div. It looks quite nice!
[19:32:46] <Velveeta> but why not just keep them in sync with each other all the time? despite whether a user is scrolling or not?
[19:33:29] <tebrkwn> So you are suggesting to remove the scroll function?
[19:33:30] <Velveeta> what you're doing is an expensive operation for one thing.. there are, say, 500 pixels, between the top set and the bottom set, which means you're gettin 500 triggers of that scroll event, and then it's parsing the dom and executing those checks, 500 times along the way
[19:34:04] <tebrkwn> Hmm true. Could you edit the jsfiddle to what you are suggesting?
[19:34:06] <Velveeta> yeah, i would just remove the onscroll function and have just constantly keep those circles in sync with each other, when one changes in the top or bottom, automatically change the one in the other area to match
[19:37:46] <tebrkwn> Just using classes?
[19:39:23] <Velveeta> tebrkwn: here's an example of how to do it, and i removed all of the extra code: http://jsfiddle.net/Dxtyu/256/
[19:41:48] <tebrkwn> Problem
[19:41:58] <tebrkwn> When you scroll they don't change?
[19:42:12] <tebrkwn> That's what the scroll function was doing.
[19:42:58] <Velveeta> oh ok, now i see what it was doing then
[19:43:06] <Velveeta> so those denoted which section you were looking at or something?
[19:43:19] <tebrkwn> Yes correct.
[19:43:22] <tebrkwn> Anything we can do here?
[19:43:23] <Velveeta> i just assumed they were radio style buttons you wanted to keep in sync with each other
[19:43:52] <Velveeta> probably, yes, but not right now, i gotta help the wife w/ some cleaning
[19:44:08] <Velveeta> you'll be best off rolling back to 255 to undo my changes, and experimenting with it some
[19:45:44] <tebrkwn> Ok then fair enough. You've been great help.
[20:10:16] <zumba_addict> if using ie9 browser, does ajax works?
[20:10:44] <pom_life> What is not valid about var finishLevelInterval = setInterval(function(){
[20:10:44] <pom_life>     console.log("Hi!");
[20:10:44] <pom_life>    };
[20:11:15] <pom_life> whoops bad copy.paste
[20:15:21] <Velveeta> zumba_addict why wouldn't it?
[20:15:44] <Velveeta> pom_life: you have no closing parens, or time interval
[20:16:01] <pom_life> Velveeta: Was a bad copy.paste, I do have that stuff :p
[20:16:25] <Velveeta> then you need to remove the semicolon also, that should be a comma
[20:16:29] <Velveeta> after your closing curly brace
[20:17:35] <BillCriswell> Dallas Buyers Club was awesome.
[20:21:04] <Velveeta> you know what else was?
[20:21:10] <Velveeta> everything star trek
[20:21:19] * Velveeta high-fives himself and mutters "nailed it!"
[20:21:45] <tw2113> sup pepperjack?
[20:22:59] <pom_life> Star trek? Whatta nerd.
[20:23:15] <pom_life> <codes for 8 more straight hours unrelenting>
[20:23:26] <Velveeta> :D
[20:23:31] <Velveeta> proud of it!
[20:23:48] <Velveeta> tw2113: everytime i see your name, i think of the old tradewars game from my bbs days
[20:23:53] <BillCriswell> peppa jack love fraggle rock.
[20:23:56] <pom_life> were you nerdy in school? just curious.
[20:25:03] <Velveeta> i'm not gonna say i was nerdy... but i took keyboarding class twice, 2 years of computer science, got up through calculus before dropping out, and never had a girlfriend
[20:25:28] <Velveeta> i found out that calculus, physics, and marijuana don't exactly mix well....... and marijuana won
[20:26:09] <pom_life> when's the last time you smoked some mj, anyway? not sure how old you are, but some of the new stuff makes the old stuff seem like oregano.
[20:26:35] <Velveeta> i'm 35 now, haven't smoked any in close to 15 years, i'm sure the modern stuff would knock me on my ass
[20:27:11] <pom_life> My mom recently tried a bit since it became legal. One hit and she was done for the entire night.
[20:27:42] <Velveeta> i lie, i think i smoked 1 or 2 hits about a decade ago, at a party with my ex-wife
[20:28:31] <pom_life> What stops you from smoking now every once in awhile? Legality? Disinterest? You a beer guy?
[20:31:54] <Velveeta> all of the above
[20:32:01] <jagan123> Hi, I have to embed my chat to client website by using small script . What is the best way to do?
[20:32:26] <Velveeta> i've become quite a lover of beer, and it's legal, and i really have no interest in getting stoned, because all i ever did back then was sit around on the couch and eat, no ambition to do anything else
[20:32:48] <Velveeta> jagan123: i don't understand what you're trying to ask
[20:33:41] <pom_life> Funny how MJ affects people differently. When I smoke, all I want to do is practice music or sketch out designs for sites/games. I can do certain things while high (sweep picking, etc) much better than if I were sober. I get inspired heavily when I smoke, but other people seem to just get lazy.
[20:34:02] <Velveeta> i'm the lazy kind
[20:34:22] <pom_life> I think it has to do with what strain you smoke, too.
[20:34:33] <pom_life> Sativa and Indica as they're called have different effects
[20:35:05] <BillCriswell> I just hate the act of smoking.
[20:35:24] <pom_life> Ever tried vaping or edibles?
[20:36:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah. It's more tolerable but I'm also really lazy.
[20:36:36] <pom_life> Fair.
[20:36:41] <BillCriswell> I'll take a couple good beers any day of the week.
[20:36:43] <Velveeta> vaping or edibles?
[20:36:48] <Velveeta> billcriswell: +1
[20:36:58] <Velveeta> as in eating pot?
[20:37:03] <pom_life> I quit smoking cigarettes December 1st. I can definitely say mary jane has helped me through these dark times.
[20:37:08] <Velveeta> i don't know how you vape pot
[20:37:27] <Velveeta> i quit smoking a little over 3 years ago.. i still miss it
[20:37:34] <BillCriswell> I've used a vaporizer. It was quite a night.
[20:37:39] <Velveeta> so there's your silver lining :D
[20:37:42] <pom_life> edible = take saucer, put in butter, sprinkle in bud, sautee for hours, filter, use as butter in ingredients
[20:37:46] <BillCriswell> And weed brownies area a good time.
[20:37:58] <Velveeta> yeah i had pot brownies back in the day
[20:38:04] <BillCriswell> Having touched anything in like 3 years though. DOn't like it enough to do it consistently.
[20:38:05] <Velveeta> didn't do much for me
[20:38:16] <pom_life> Velveeta: wasnt made right then
[20:38:24] <pom_life> A small amount will knock you on your ass if done correctly
[20:38:30] <Velveeta> well, it had about a quarter ounce in it
[20:38:44] <pom_life> how long was the cannabutter sauteed for is the question
[20:38:51] <pom_life> the longer you hold out, the better it is
[20:39:05] <Velveeta> but i really have no desire to sit here and debate the merits of various types of edible preparations of something i haven't even thought about doing in a decade
[20:39:27] <pom_life> fair enough :] i hope you don't think i was forcing the conversation on you
[20:39:31] <Velveeta> i *used* to be a pothead, now i'm just a drunk
[20:39:52] <Velveeta> not at all, i just don't want to continue talking about it, because i still have no interest in it :D
[20:40:09] <Velveeta> plus i'm sure there are more appropriate channels for that discussion ;)
[20:40:18] <Uhkis> #jquery-addictions :-D
[20:40:40] <Velveeta> #dev-crutches
[20:40:47] <BillCriswell> My only addiction is... sadly the fucking internet.
[20:40:51] <Velveeta> lol
[20:41:06] <pom_life> so I need to append my selector #FourTwenty to #SwisherSweet. How can I do this?
[20:41:08] <Velveeta> i know what you mean, i often tell people "i'm always online, like the fuckin lawnmower man"
[20:41:31] <BillCriswell> If I wasn't making a living building websites I'd like to think I can turn around and never look back, but I doubt it.
[20:41:39] <pom_life> By the way: Why are css classes/ids not allowed to have a number as the first character?
[20:41:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah. I hate it about myself.
[20:41:43] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: isn't everybody addicted to the internet these days
[20:41:45] <Velveeta> $('#SwisherSweet').empty().append('#FourTwenty')
[20:42:49] <BillCriswell> pom_life: I'm sure there's a really good nerd reason.
[20:42:52] <Velveeta> pom_life: i would imagine just because the spec says so?
[20:42:59] <pom_life> it's so iritating :|
[20:43:04] <pom_life> s/iritating/irritating
[20:43:10] <BillCriswell> I rarely use any numbers in my class or id attributes now that I think about it.
[20:43:11] <Velveeta> why do you have need to do that?
[20:43:14] <BillCriswell> Probably never.
[20:43:16] <Velveeta> same here
[20:43:30] <pom_life> I don't "need to"... I'd like to sometimes. IDK.
[20:43:30] <Velveeta> any numeric values you're trying to track as part of a name should be stored as a data-* attribute
[20:44:03] <Velveeta> uhkis: if everybody's addicted to the internet, then nobody is, huzzah!
[20:44:07] <pom_life> Velveeta: Didn't you mention a downside of setIntervals the other day? What was that about?
[20:44:26] <Velveeta> that's like saying everybody is addicted to breathing and eating.. if everybody does it, it's just..... life
[20:44:45] <Velveeta> pom_life: i don't think so, but i may have mentioned a downside to dom polling
[20:44:51] <Velveeta> *using* a setInterval
[20:45:53] <Velveeta> oh, and also, chris coyier says that while #hashTagSelectors won't work for id's that start with a number, you *can* use [id="123abc"] for a valid selector: http://css-tricks.com/ids-cannot-start-with-a-number/
[20:47:26] <pom_life> That's strange
[20:48:05] <BillCriswell> There's a lot of shit you can do that you shouldn't be able to. Not sure how I feel about the leniency but I don't think vendors have a choice.
[20:48:34] <Velveeta> there are some areas of the spec that are left completely up to the vendors by design
[20:48:56] <Velveeta> certain rules that need to be followed, but the implementation details are optional
[20:49:39] <Velveeta> i would imagine this is one of those cases, where it says something like id selectors can't start with a number, so #123 is invalid, but attribute-matching selectors have no such constraint, so matching against the id attribute is valid for "123"
[20:50:08] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Good argument.
[20:51:24] <Velveeta> here's a fun bit of trivia: when the browser does matching for the css parser, does it match elements from top down or bottom up as far as parsing the dom tree for selector matching?
[20:51:54] <BillCriswell> I'd assume top down. I'm bad at guessing though.
[20:52:01] <Velveeta> close!
[20:52:09] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: document.getElementById('123').innerHTML = 'Bye'; Do you think that should work?
[20:52:12] <Velveeta> but on a 50/50 question, close === wrong :D
[20:52:21] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Hahaha true.
[20:52:22] <Velveeta> i would think it shouldn't
[20:52:38] <Velveeta> but i'm not sure
[20:52:39] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It does work, in Chrome at least.
[20:52:51] <Velveeta> yeah i was gonna say it depends on whether it runs through querySelector or not
[20:53:10] <Velveeta> but i forgot, that relationship is probably backwards, querySelector probably optimizes through getElementById when it can
[20:53:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: So it goes from bottom up and reverses it?
[20:54:25] <Velveeta> so the reason for the bottom up matching for css selectors is that it's much less expensive for something like "div p span span.text" to just find all spans of class "text", and see if it has a an ancestor of type span, with an ancestor of type p, with an ancestor of type div, then for it to start at the top of the dom tree and parse N different paths down to the very bottom
[20:55:05] <Velveeta> yepyep, once you find all of the bottom level nodes that match the end of the selector string, you only need to walk up through parentNode after parentNode until you hit the top and see if it satisfied everything along the way
[20:55:11] <BillCriswell> Oh, I misinterpreted that.
[20:55:25] <Velveeta> whereas the other way, you're walking N branches with N branches with N branches all the way down to the bottom of every single path
[20:55:49] <BillCriswell> So it goes out on the furthest branches then works its way in?
[20:55:58] <Velveeta> yep
[20:56:17] <BillCriswell> That makes sense
[20:56:18] <Velveeta> it just does like a getElementsByTagName, and then walks up the dom from each of those endpoints
[20:56:40] <Velveeta> yeah, the first time the question was put to me, i answered the same as you
[20:56:49] <Velveeta> and then when it was explained to me, i was like "that makes absolute sense"
[20:57:31] <zumba_addict> just got back Velveeta
[20:57:56] <BillCriswell> Going to bed and dreaming of no snow on the ground tomorrow morning.
[20:57:57] <Velveeta> wb
[20:58:05] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.
[20:58:26] <zumba_addict> at work, another dev is working on a PUT method issue. I think it's because what we are trying to fix is an app running on our localhost and it;s doing a PUT on a remote server. I think it's called CORS
[20:58:45] <zumba_addict> it works fine in Chrome but not on IE9
[20:59:14] <Velveeta> yeah, if you want to have access to remote servers via ajax, it has to be done w/ a jsonp request as far as i know
[20:59:39] <Velveeta> but that's not ajax not working, that's standard browser security across all browsers
[21:16:53] <diegoviola> hi
[21:17:08] <diegoviola> is there a way to hide a div with its content with a link or something? i'm looking to do just that
[21:17:12] <diegoviola> any idea where to look please?
[21:17:41] <diegoviola> hide/unhide
[21:20:23] <zumba_addict> so Velveeta, I remember someone told me that IE9 dislike the way we are doing it similar to what you said. So there is no workaround for it?
[22:17:59] <lamilami> hey, does anyone know why cookies aren't being sent with the request when I use $.ajax? the ajax call is across subdomains but the cookies are sent in the request for the actual page
[22:47:13] <the8thbit> .css() doesnt seem to do anything for me
[22:49:17] <Whiskey> whats wrong here "{$.now() + 2}" try to get unixtime + 2 seconds
[22:53:46] <the8thbit> nvm im dumb
[23:02:04] <bi> Whiskey: I think you are adding 2ms, not 2 seconds.  Might want "... + 2000"?
[23:23:39] <the8thbit> can I do $( #elm ).data()?
[23:25:14] <Cork> the8thbit: yes
[23:25:26] <Cork> that will give you an object with all the values on the object
[23:25:28] <Cork> *element
[23:26:30] <the8thbit> Cork: thanks
[23:29:49] <krz> how can i select input fields with name=foo[bar]?
[23:33:29] <Cork> $('input[name="foo[bar]"]')
[23:36:33] <krz> ah nice, thanks Cork
[23:52:41] <Hilton> .toggle() has a few ways it can be called, one if which is .toggle(true/false) which is a great shortcut over if (this == that) { $(...).show(); } else { $(...).hide(); } - instead use $(...).toggle(this == that);. However, the function cannot accept a DURATION in this manner, nor does there seem to be a way to pass the "showOrHide" parameter via another method (like the options array). Is...
[23:52:43] <Hilton> ...there another function which will act like .toggle(showOrHide), but let me specify an animation duration?
