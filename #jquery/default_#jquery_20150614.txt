[00:39:23] <Meir`> joy4u although it's a 3rd party plugin, i assume that a bit of code will help people to answer you
[00:41:03] <Meir`> also, it seems like this plugin is discontinued

[02:42:33] <Rayne> Hello *. I have added jQuery Mobile to my website and now clicking on a link fades the website out and the new content in. What is the name of this feature and how do I disable it? (A custom jQuery Mobile build with touch-only events doesn't fade the content in and out.)
[03:01:06] <Meir`> Rayne, what's the defaultPageTransition
[03:01:18] <Meir`> you can change it before loading the jquery mobile js file
[03:02:03] <Meir`> $( document ).on( "mobileinit", function() { $mobile.defaultPageTransition = 'none'; });
[03:02:36] <Rayne> Great, thank you for your help Meir`
[03:02:41] <Meir`> do it after loading jquery and before loading jquery-mobile
[03:03:04] <Meir`> you can see various other default settings here: https://api.jquerymobile.com/global-config/
[03:04:22] <Meir`> [12:59:32] <Meir`> Rayne, what's the defaultPageTransition
[03:04:30] <Meir`> that's ** :) had to fix hehe
[03:04:33] <Meir`> no problem
[04:22:09] <Parsec300> Hi, I'm trying to understand the combobox widget and it is very confusing for me (novice javascript). I've tried to copy the code from http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/06/a-jquery-ui-combobox-under-the-hood and put it in a test document like this: http://pastebin.com/FuhW83VK, but FireBug keeps telling me that TypeError: input.data(...) is undefined and the box partially works. But instead of showing t
[04:22:15] <Parsec300> he options possible options neatly in a box that unfolds, it just shows a lot of text with very letter in <strong>
[04:23:10] <Parsec300> Oh wait, the latter is probably a css problem, which I haven't included yet
[04:25:23] <Parsec300> With the CSS added, it still displays weirly in the box
[04:26:51] <Parsec300> Like http://pasteboard.co/1dn7xdJM.png
[04:32:47] <vdeep> Parsec300 can you share your complete code?
[04:32:57] <vdeep> Or maybe create a fiddle
[04:53:45] <Parsec300> vdeep, that is the complete test.hmtl code
[04:54:18] <Parsec300> But I've noticed that the code of the actual widget differs from the code in the explanation of the widget
[04:54:50] <Parsec300> And I've used and posted the explanation code. The actual code works quite well
[04:54:59] <Parsec300> And I'm trying to figure out how it works
[04:56:49] <vdeep> Parsec300 I can't check logBook.js like this
[05:03:00] <Parsec300> vdeep, Oh that, it actually doesn't do anything in this paste. It was copied indeliberately during some code copy-paste
[05:08:02] <decx> fiddle?
[05:16:36] <Parsec300> decx, https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=wA5kyRrqgR
[05:16:51] <Parsec300> But it doesn't work in jsfiddle. I probably pasted it wrong
[05:16:54] <decx> i dont want to together js :p
[05:17:02] <decx> the shit's creepy af
[05:17:30] <Parsec300> https://jsfiddle.net/rf8cwhLw/
[05:17:59] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/rf8cwhLw/1/
[05:18:07] <Parsec300> It's suppoed to work like https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox (although I removed the button and the arrow button
[05:19:01] <Parsec300> Ah, ok.
[05:20:05] <Parsec300> In the _source: function( request, response ), where does the function get the request and response from?
[05:20:53] <Parsec300> It is called like source: $.proxy( this, "_source" )
[05:20:56] <decx> those are the arguments for that function
[05:21:11] <Parsec300> Yes, but I never see it being passed any arguments
[05:21:29] <decx> because widgets are weird
[05:22:40] <Parsec300> Apparently
[05:23:19] <decx> ^you'll have to dig in ui's core to really get it
[05:23:40] <decx> note, i never did
[05:25:38] <Parsec300> Ok, I would like to make my own combobox. I'd like to know the basic logic behind it
[05:25:43] <Parsec300> So you have two elements
[05:25:54] <Parsec300> You hide one
[05:26:28] <Parsec300> Have the input of the second one show a selection box of the first one?
[05:27:37] <decx> it's mapping the options into an on object that the source function understands
[05:29:28] <Parsec300> I don't understand
[05:31:37] <earational> hey
[05:38:57] <Parsec300> Hi
[05:50:25] <Parsec300> So, decx, the autocomplete already has a drop-down list built in. Is the 'select' merely used for data-source?
[05:51:51] <decx> yes
[05:53:12] <Parsec300> So, If I have javascript retrieve a json object as a data-source I could use it instead of the 'select' and leave the select out completely
[05:53:25] <lintguy> I couldn't find any so i'll ask here, do anyone know of a drag/drop menu editor for jquery that uses JSON for the structure?
[05:54:37] <Parsec300> lintguy, if I get your question, you are looking for a wysiwyg menu editor?
[05:54:57] <lintguy> wysiwyg for me is an editor, but sure.
[05:58:15] <Parsec300> I can't help you though
[06:00:13] <lintguy> Ah, ok
[06:02:19] <Pazician> Hola everyone. Just a quick question, what's your thoughts about copying a already made design from eg a site like YouTube and then coding it up just to practice coding and then showing of in my portfolio, is that alright or should I use Lorem Ipsum as text and other images but still have the design?
[06:04:31] <Parsec300> Well, you can't go wrong with the second option
[06:06:08] <Pazician> Parsec300: You mean it's not cool to copy and have the design just like a practice and say "Hey, this is what I can build"?
[06:11:26] <Parsec300> I'm very new to the whole programming, so I don't dare suggest to you that the first option is ok. Personally I don't think it's a problem as long as you don't post it online and use it
[06:12:07] <Pazician> It will be online, since I'm planning to put it on my portfolio as an example of what I can build.
[06:13:49] <Parsec300> Don't know what others will think, but I'd say go for it
[06:15:16] <Pazician> Yeah, alright. Well, the thing is that I'm really bad at getting stuff designed, like no creativity at all. But I do have a passion for code.
[06:22:57] <Parsec300> Pazician, that seems to be not uncommon
[06:23:25] <Parsec300> That's why generally within companies they tend to have different people for those tasks
[06:23:44] <Parsec300> People good at designing tend not to be good at code. There are of course some exceptions
[06:26:59] <Pazician> So basically it would be just fine to copy the design to use it like a showcase on my portfolio?
[06:27:29] <jamshed> hello, i have seen website where after scrolling down, the background gets stuck at one point and the text on it scrolls up, and when the text is scrolled up, the scroll moves down to show the rest of the page like a normal scoll, I know its parallax, can anyone point me to a tutorial/plugin which can do this, Thanks
[06:28:31] <Pazician> jamshed: Google "Parallax tutorial" there's so much out there, also check out DevTips at YouTube.
[06:37:48] <Parsec300> Pazician, I don't think I can be of much help here other than state my personal opinion
[06:38:23] <Pazician> No worries, I do really appreciate your thought and opinions
[06:42:14] <leporello> Hi. How to capture window.load or window resize event on parent nodes before childs?
[06:47:42] <Meir`> leporello, what do you mean by parent and childs? is it frames and opened window handling?
[06:48:32] <leporello> Meir`, i want my outer div receive window.resize event before its children
[06:49:54] <Meir`> leporello, from what i know, DOM element don't "receive" window events
[06:50:23] <Meir`> do you have $( window ).resize(function() { }); ?
[06:50:41] <leporello> Meir` on('load resize, blahblah)
[06:51:22] <leporello> Outer div runs handler after children, i need it to run before
[06:51:53] <Meir`> leporello, but this is binded to the window
[06:52:29] <Meir`> e.g. $window.on('load resize, blahblah)
[06:52:42] <Meir`> sorry, $(window).on('load resize, blahblah)
[06:54:15] <leporello> Meir`, really.
[06:54:41] <leporello> So how can I handler queue? Seems like children put theri handler earlier
[06:55:44] <Meir`> leporello, please describe what you're trying to do.
[06:56:11] <leporello> it's really angular question, but they aren't asking.
[06:56:17] <leporello> I have a carousel directive
[06:56:42] <leporello> which is placed in outer div and changes size of background on window resize and load
[06:57:03] <Meir`> i'm not really familiar with angular, but i hope i can help with jquery related issues
[06:57:25] <leporello> And then i have some inner divs with their directives, which are looking on window resize and need to take that changed size
[06:57:41] <Meir`> and the background is of the carousel itself?
[06:57:59] <leporello> Meir`?
[06:58:17] <leporello> It's horizontal scrolling with fullscreen background
[06:58:19] <Meir`> and what that divs do with the changed size?
[06:59:00] <leporello> Meir`, they place 3d-twisted image over backgournd. It doesn't matter really, the only thing - they should know actual size of background.
[07:00:17] <leporello> Meir`, i can pass that size to them via variable, but I want to have some independency. There can be carousels without inner divs or inner divs without carousel.
[07:00:36] <Meir`> leporello, simply use same calucaltion for the background and the divs
[07:01:31] <Parsec300> Pazician, you're welcome
[07:01:37] <Meir`> with $(window).height() and $(window).width()
[07:01:41] <leporello> Meir`, inner directive is attached to image. It should be any image - resizable or not.
[07:02:46] <Meir`> you said that those divs place image on top of the background, according to the background size
[07:03:03] <Meir`> and this background size changed with the window resize
[07:03:06] <Meir`> right?
[07:03:15] <Meir`> changes*
[07:04:31] <leporello> Meir`, outer div is always depends on window resize.
[07:04:55] <leporello> Inner div can have a connection to any image set as an atribute.
[07:05:06] <leporello> If it's background, then it is resizable.
[07:05:52] <Meir`> leporello, and how do you determine that connection?
[07:06:01] <leporello> I need correct event handler order. Seems like my inner div places event handler earlier, than outer.
[07:06:18] <leporello> Meir`, via for='imageId' attribute
[07:07:04] <Meir`> ok so i can assume that you know the imageId of the background
[07:07:05] <Meir`> right?
[07:08:03] <leporello> <carousel><carousel-section id='bkImage'><sg-plate for='bkImage'></sg-plate><carousel-section> ... </carousel>
[07:09:15] <leporello> carousel-section changes its size on load and reszie. Then sg-plate SHOULD get that bkImage size and do some calc depending on that size. But it's opposite.
[07:12:22] <Meir`> $(window).on('load resize', function() { $("carousel #bkImage).css( { height: $( window ).height(), width: $( window ).width() });
[07:12:28] <Meir`> errr
[07:12:44] <Meir`> sent accidently
[07:14:08] <Meir`> $(window).on('load resize', function() { $("carousel #bkImage).css( { "height": $(window).height(), "width": $(window).width() }); $("g-plate[for='bkImage']").css({ ........ }); });
[07:14:22] <Meir`> leporello, have a look ^
[07:15:07] <Meir`> the "........ " at the end is for you to do whatever you want with every "g-plate" that is connected to "bkImage"
[07:15:34] <Meir`> you can use there $(window).height() and $(window).width(), as i used for the "bkImage" itself
[07:16:13] <Meir`> by the way, i think you can use plain css to achieve what you want
[07:16:28] <Meir`> if the carousel should fill the whole page
[07:16:30] <leporello> Meir`, more common question. How can I see window event queue?
[07:16:48] <Meir`> simply define its width and height in css to 100%
[07:17:05] <Meir`> then you can do the same with carousel-section id='bkImage'
[07:19:13] <jamshed> hello, which is the best parallax scrolling plugin and most widely used?
[07:22:01] <Meir`> leporello, sorry, but i can't understand what do you mean by "window event queue"
[07:22:29] <leporello> Meir`, window object has it's listeners queue
[07:22:31] <leporello> or should have
[07:22:34] <Meir`> every time you resize the window, the "resize" event is triggered once, and it's binded to the whole window
[07:22:51] <Meir`> you want to cache multiple resizings?
[07:23:14] <leporello> I want to understand how listeners are attached to widnow object.
[07:23:26] <leporello> And understand the order they run.
[07:25:52] <Meir`> leporello, you mean in case that there are duplicate $(window).on('load resize' ?
[07:28:30] <leporello> Meir`, my directives put event handlers in incorrect order.
[07:28:39] <leporello> That's the only reason of my problem.
[07:29:00] <leporello> Meir`thank you anyway for your time
[07:30:11] <Meir`> i think there's kind of miscommunication in this conversation
[07:30:57] <Meir`> anyway, my main idea was: if you bind something to the background size, and you bind the background size to the window size
[07:31:10] <Meir`> so you can bind that "something" to the window size too
[07:31:38] <Meir`> so you won't have any syncronization issues
[08:27:03] <SuperTyp> when I set contentType to false, what contentType is ajax expecting to return so that it triggers the .done and not .fail?
[08:30:25] <snover> SuperTyp: contentType is for the content type header for the transmitted data not the received data.
[09:09:53] <SuperTyp> yes but if I set dataType to json and I do not return a proper json it would return a fail even with status code 200 OK, right?
[09:10:30] <SuperTyp> so if contentType is false I can't set header( 'Content-Type: application/json' );
[09:10:37] <SuperTyp> (I figured it out by myself now)
[09:17:32] <bradbrad> Guys im using jquery to sum the totals of a column, and right not it displays an alert, but I need it to rather replace the contents with another div with the class "total"... what would i use instead of alert(sum);?

[09:36:06] <ashemark> Hi!
[09:40:30] <ashemark> I'm using jQuery to communicate with a rest api that responds with json data, and dynamically add the same to my html with handlebars.
[09:40:58] <SuperTyp> jQM: I have a popup which I had on one page first but now on everypage (so as child of body) now when the popup shows up the icon for the close button is text and no more the icon...http://jsfiddle.net/kmegysqa/1/
[09:41:18] <ashemark> with each row, I'm also displaying a button, pressing which should initiate an ajax call with that row's data as parameter..
[09:41:29] <SuperTyp> http://jsfiddle.net/kmegysqa/1/
[09:41:49] <ashemark> how do I get the row data on button press?
[10:17:13] <SuperTyp> solved, enhanceWithin needs to be called to the popup element
[10:54:44] <haroldjfks> hi :-)
[10:55:06] <haroldjfks> $("#mioframe").contents().find... ok understood
[10:55:32] <haroldjfks> but if i want to find if the p (paragraph inside the iframe) contains something?
[10:55:53] <haroldjfks> that is, if contains a text...
[10:57:13] <haroldjfks> i tried $("#myframe").contents().find("p:contains('something')").hide();
[10:57:21] <haroldjfks> but it doesn't work... can you help me?
[11:00:16] <Pistachio> Anyone have any idea how to set default value from the database with the x-editable address extension?
[11:09:09] <haroldjfks> anyone here to help me with the paragraph inside the iframe, please?
[11:28:30] <SuperTyp> haroldjfks: be patient
[11:31:06] <placidb> hi. I've been having some trouble getting my slideshow animation/navigation to work properly. when I navigate to random positions in the slideshow, the order gets messed up. I suspect it has to do with the animation not properly stop()ing or finish()ing. any help would be greatly appreciated. dev: http://olivesandmore.greyhat.nl/
[11:33:46] <placidb> if I interrupt an animation and navigate to another slide, the order of the items seems to get messed up. I've been researching this for a while now, but not getting anywhere :/
[11:36:03] <SuperTyp> haroldjfks: your iframes src is not cross domain right?
[11:43:16] <SuperTyp> placidb: that link though...
[11:43:43] <puddle> hi I have a json that contains information like this {"password":["The password field is required."]} can someone please tell me how can I iterate through the json to only get the "The password field is required." part?
[11:44:31] <perint43> SuperTyp: no, it's loaded from the same domain
[11:44:33] <puddle> or loop through it maybe that is the proper word for it
[11:44:45] <placidb> SuperTyp: what do you mean?
[11:49:33] <SuperTyp> placidb: provide a correct link, nobody here wants to search the slideshow first
[11:50:18] <SuperTyp> perint43: I am confused now, are you haroldjfks? :)
[11:50:31] <perint43> yes...
[11:51:08] <SuperTyp> puddle: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4424518/accessing-json-data-from-jquery
[11:51:15] <perint43> i didn't change nick myself... maybe disconnected for a while lol
[11:52:31] <puddle> SuperTyp thanks i tried it but im doing something wrong
[11:52:54] <SuperTyp> puddle: provide some code then (jsfiddle/pastebin/pastie...)
[11:53:54] <puddle> SuperTyp https://gist.github.com/felyx/f5040d74cd4f825beb4c
[11:53:59] <SuperTyp> perint43: did you tried this $("#myframe").contents().find("p").contains('something')).hide(); ?
[11:54:21] <puddle> SuperTyp console.log(errors); results in this: {"password":["The password field is required."]}
[11:54:29] <puddle> but the one below gets me error
[11:55:24] <placidb> SuperTyp: I understand. this is a more specific link: http://olivesandmore.greyhat.nl/catalog/view/javascript/common.js (starting at line 158)
[11:56:12] <SuperTyp> puddle: array index starts at 0 not at 1
[11:57:36] <puddle> SuperTyp since this json will contain errors for all fields is there a way ti loop through the jason and get all the attributes without providing properties?
[11:57:57] <SuperTyp> placidb: is that a custom slideshow?
[11:58:18] <puddle> SuperTyp btw I changed the index to 0 and i get ane rror still Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[11:58:45] <placidb> SuperTyp: yes.
[11:59:04] <perint43> SuperTyp: this on console ".find(...).contains is not a function"
[11:59:05] <SuperTyp> puddle: please show complete structure of data
[11:59:26] <puddle> 1 sec
[11:59:35] <SuperTyp> placidb: why? so many plugins, none did fit your needs?
[12:00:03] <SuperTyp> puddle yes with foreach function maybe
[12:00:27] <puddle> {readyState: 4, responseText: "{"password":["The password field is required."]}", responseJSON: Object, status: 422, statusText: "Unprocessable Entity"}
[12:00:31] <placidb> SuperTyp: correct. none did exactly what I needed, specifically, none had the specific responsive nature that I required.
[12:00:38] <puddle> this is the data object
[12:01:22] <DJDan_> How does JQueryGrid (jqxGrid) differ from the default JQuery Grid?
[12:01:46] <dimi1947> does anynbody know the input type reset button when it resets a form from where it takes the values?
[12:02:33] <dimi1947> does is takes them from the value attribute of the input form?
[12:02:51] <SuperTyp> puddle: did you type that by hand or copy paste?
[12:03:09] <puddle> some of it I copied
[12:03:12] <SuperTyp> puddle: doesn't seem to be valid JSON to me and jsonformatter
[12:06:26] <perint43> SuperTyp: are you sure that i can use find... contains ?
[12:06:35] <placidb> SuperTyp: also, I prefer to keep my code as light as possible.
[12:06:41] <perint43> 'cause here it says it's not a function
[12:07:15] <rcyr> contains doesn't exist...
[12:07:26] <rcyr> find and includes are ES6 so most browsers don't have it.
[12:07:52] <rcyr> Unless you're talking about the jQuery functions :)
[12:08:28] <rcyr> If you, you might have an unwrapped node (not jQueryfied)
[12:08:32] <rcyr> *If so
[12:08:51] <SuperTyp> perint43: nope not sure
[12:10:31] <puddle> SuperTyp i had to turn it into a json object with JSON.parse now it works, I can get the keys for (var key in errors) { console.log(key); }
[12:10:39] <puddle> now i need to figure out how to get the values not the keys
[12:10:56] <perint43> rcyr: i'm here for jQuery lol contains doesn't exist?
[12:11:21] <rcyr> perint43: In javascript, no. In jQuery yes
[12:11:22] <rcyr> :)
[12:11:22] <perint43> jQuery 1.7.2 ... if i use p:contains ... it exists lol
[12:12:23] <perint43> rcyr: $("#myframe").contents().find("p").contains('here').hide(); why doesn't work?
[12:13:19] <rcyr> perint43: That line looks fine, does it make an error in your console?
[12:13:49] <perint43> rcyr: "....find(...).contains is not a function"
[12:14:17] <perint43> jQuery is loaded on the page...
[12:14:47] <rcyr> Seriously, this should work :/
[12:16:19] <SuperTyp> perint43: correct me if I am wrong but does .contains() work for strings like text?
[12:16:46] <SuperTyp> "Description: Check to see if a DOM element is a descendant of another DOM element."
[12:16:56] <SuperTyp> this means 'here' must be a DOM element
[12:17:03] <SuperTyp> or not?
[12:25:01] <perint43> I need to find if the p inside iframe contains a text: how to do it?
[12:25:21] <perint43> IF p inside the iframe contains "something" i have to hide it lol
[12:42:41] <SuperTyp> perint43: maybe it helps: http://jsfiddle.net/7zjgd7p3/
[12:47:24] <SuperTyp> with combination of contents() it should work
[13:10:22] <perint43> SuperTyp: pardon, what a button has to do with iframe? lol
[13:11:14] <perint43> 1) the iframe is already loaded on the page 2) inside the iframe I have to find the p which contains "something" and hide it...
[13:11:16] <perint43> easy
[13:26:19] <perint43> I found the issue... I tried to change the html content and then it goes overwritten 'cause iframe is not ready loaded
[13:26:53] <perint43> then i tried "('#myframe').load(function() { $('#myframe').contents().find('body').html('<div> blah </div>'); });"
[13:27:05] <perint43> but the "blah" is overwritten again...
[13:27:24] <perint43> so how to do it AFTER the iframe is entirely loaded?
[14:43:32] <perint43> I solved it loading the jquery inside the iframe too... easier lol
[16:03:28] <jamshed> anyone familiar with scrollorama here?
[16:35:14] <Sal> i have a list of <li><a..></li>
[16:35:26] <Sal> how can i trigger a click from the first link?
[17:20:51] <BillCriswell> You can use .first().trigger('click') on the collecton.. or .eq(1)
[17:21:18] <BillCriswell> Er, eq(0)
[17:28:09] <Voyage> Max-P,  It is well known that most sites now days do NOT allow their contents to be injected in an iframe e.g facebook. "X-Frame-Options: DENY". Can we just get those sites to be viewed in a div by help of javascript?
[17:43:26] <Voyage> can anyone see why this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/xq0jxfuz/
[17:46:28] <Voyage> can anyone see why this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/xq0jxfuz/1/
[17:46:37] <rcyr> Because of the same origin policy restriction.
[17:50:23] <Voyage> work around?
[18:02:08] <Woet> what are you actually trying to do?
[18:02:28] <Woet> i assume you don't want google's HTML on your website
[19:06:31] <Max-P> Voyage: Yes, it's common. It's a gigantic security flaw to allow so, so most websites that have a login page and such block that. Because otherwise ANY malicious website could just, say, load up facebook.com and steal the keys and get full unrestricted access to your account. Which is bad
[19:06:39] <znf> Is there a better way to write this code? http://pastebin.com/jHUVENFS
[19:06:44] <znf> I feel it's too spaghetti-ish
[19:07:07] <Voyage> Max-P,  so no workaround?
[19:07:27] <Max-P> Voyage: Nope. Unless the website explicitely offers you a way to cooperate, it's not doable
[19:07:48] <Max-P> Although since you're doing a browser extension, there might be a special API to disable the security, but I don't know for sure.
[19:07:52] <Voyage> Max-P,  we have made the extensions but now at mercy of those sites. If they update, ext will break
[19:08:16] <Voyage> Max-P,  one way is to put a server in middle and pipe data. but that involves too much
[19:09:49] <Max-P> Voyage: Yeah, I really don't know at this point. Browsers have a bunch of extra APIs for extensions but I don't know them. Read the docs, I'm sure there's a way, you just need to figure out how.
[19:10:30] <Voyage> hm thanks
[19:10:48] <Max-P> znf: Not much. I can compact it to about 4 lines, but it will still be as ugly. You probly want to try adding classes to the elements instead of accessing them all by ID
[19:11:10] <znf> Can't edit the actual html
[19:11:11] <Max-P> znf: Or maybe change the DOM structure entirely to make it more logical
[19:11:16] <znf> (userscript)
[19:11:31] <Max-P> oh
[19:15:52] <Voyage> How to send CORS request by jQuery? http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
[19:17:05] <Max-P> znf: That's about as good as it can get: http://d.max-p.me/temp/irc/jquery/znf-1.txt
[19:17:09] <Voyage> nvm, found it
[19:17:32] <znf> Max-P, Ha. Nice.
[19:18:00] <Max-P> Could do a bit of math to calculate the numbers (8 maps to 0, 9 maps to 1) in a for loop, bit it's a bit more complicated and won't expand well if the logic gets broken somehow
[19:18:24] <Max-P> But since you're at the mercy of the site you add a userscript to, yeah, it's bound to be ugly :/
[19:18:56] <Voyage> well didnt
[19:25:22] * Max-P learns that CORS is yet another Javascript kludge to add features on top of other broken features

[20:44:33] <Max-P> This was ridiculous and pointless
[20:48:26] <Poppabear> ^ agreed
[20:49:47] <jamshed> wtheck was that for
[20:50:05] <Max-P> I wonder why people aren't insta-banned by the server itself
[20:50:20] <jamshed> i thought flooding would result in auto ban?
[20:50:23] <jamshed> or kick
[20:50:32] <Max-P> Not here, apparently
[20:51:33] <snover> what do you think this is quakenet
[21:40:10] <arc_> is it possible to find the hash you are scrolled past on scroll
[23:22:01] <Cork> arc_: collect the elements and check the position().top
[23:37:24] <dimi1947> I want to use remove() to remove from the DOM a specific number of input elements....initially there is always 2 input or more elements and I just want to add the ones added on retrospect which of course their number may vary   https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/hdxfxomu/53/
[23:50:53] <Cork> dimi1947: you mean like https://jsfiddle.net/hdxfxomu/54/ ?
[23:51:59] <dimi1947> exactly right....and as I see the code was too simple...
