[03:26:35] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know why the text here is not set to update? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/33dc57a03734c1b504cd7efe82335d17
[03:28:49] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: create a jsfiddle
[03:29:10] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: a warning though you store the .name element in $NewRow not the full element
[03:29:22] <Cork> (from the template)
[03:29:55] <Cork> (the reason i ask for a jsfiddle is that you have no context at all so it isn't possible to tell what is going on)
[03:31:00] <KnightsOfNi> well I made a jsfiddle and I don't have the prolblem in there :(
[03:31:33] <Cork> so the problem is most likely outside the code you pasted
[03:31:45] <KnightsOfNi> let me try to add some more context
[03:35:43] <KnightsOfNi> Oh yeah, the problem was related to what you said Cork
[03:35:46] <KnightsOfNi> got it now
[03:36:02] <Cork> :)
[04:05:27] <undefined_bob> does anyone have an idea why ie11 doesnt display my menu items when they have sub-menus? could it be something jQuery/JavaScript related? does ie11 handle that stuff differently than other browsers?
[04:13:53] <AdamPDotty> Does MSIE support HTML yet?
[04:19:38] <KnightsOfNi> What is the difference between doing $el.data('id', 5) and $el.attr('data-id', 5) ?
[04:42:57] <undefined_bob> AdamPDotty: lol I'm not sure about that. its pretty annoying that everything works well on every browser except MS edge and ie11
[04:43:53] <undefined_bob> I thought someone might have experience with how those two browsers handle jq/js. maybe there is something general, which I dont know
[04:44:03] <KnightsOfNi> screw all MS browsers
[04:44:14] <KnightsOfNi> I don't even test in those anymore
[04:44:29] <undefined_bob> not even edge?
[04:52:58] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: the first stores the number 5 in the data reference in jquery, the second stores the string "5" as an attribute on the element
[04:53:16] <Cork> so it is quite different
[04:53:41] <Cork> .data('id') will read the attribute data-id, if jquery haven't seen a value for it yet
[04:53:55] <Cork> (and do json parsing of the content)
[04:54:51] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: basically, you want to use attr('data-*', ) if you want css to have access to id, and .data for everything else
[04:55:12] <Cork> s/access to id/access to it/
[04:55:12] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> KnightsOfNi: basically, you want to use attr('data-*', ) if you want css to have access to it, and .data for everything else
[05:01:39] <KnightsOfNi> yes ok
[05:01:41] <KnightsOfNi> thanks
[06:55:57] <devi8> how can I setup a named animation queue that I can dequeue later...and can queues be setup to be recycled or used again?
[06:56:21] <Cork> they can't be recycled
[06:56:32] <Cork> when a function is executed it is removed from the queue
[06:56:57] <Cork> to have a queue you can run "later" just give it a different name then the default
[06:57:17] <devi8> but I can't clone a queue, for example
[06:57:22] <Cork> no
[06:57:31] <Cork> a queue is just a chain of function calls
[06:57:39] <Cork> you can execute it, or remove it
[06:57:41] <Cork> that's it
[06:57:55] <Cork> (well add new functions to the end of it is a third option)
[06:58:03] <devi8> There used to be a thing called "Fuse" for actionscript that enabled queueing of actionscripts with changeable targets
[06:58:20] <Cork> actionscript isn't what you have in browsers
[06:58:30] <devi8> this was back during the flash days
[06:58:39] <Cork> ya
[06:58:45] <Cork> and that isn't part of browsers
[06:59:04] <devi8> it was a great library. I wish the same existed in js.
[06:59:19] <devi8> I have been trying (half-heartedly) to duplicate it.
[06:59:29] <Cork> you could most likely do it, but it isn't what jquery does
[08:16:13] <tilerendering> I m using $.getJSON and it works fine but the server actually sends cookies in the response “page” which I cant access in my $.getJSON response - is there a way for me to access them?
[08:18:17] <Cork> .done(data, status, xhr) { xhr.getResponseHeader('Set-Cookie') }) should work
[08:19:21] <tilerendering> merci
[08:29:54] <tilerendering> hm. kind of doesnt, returns null
[08:30:49] <tilerendering> however, when I point my browser to the ajax call url, the server will respond with a document (json) that will be displayed in the browser, and the browser tells me there is a server set cookie. in javascript, on that response page, I can access that cookie
[08:36:02] <Cork> tilerendering: is the json served from the same domain as you run the script from?
[08:42:09] <tilerendering> Cork: the domains are identical: the cookies domain is “http://localhost”, its path is “/BackendAPI”
[08:42:38] <tilerendering> the json is server from http://localhost/BackendAPI/loginresult.html for instance
[08:42:44] <tilerendering> forget the .html
[08:42:49] <tilerendering> server=served
[08:43:23] <tilerendering> I just examined the response in ff dev tools
[08:43:29] <tilerendering> “Set-Cookie” Header is there
[08:43:41] <tilerendering> but I guess js is prohibiting me accessing it
[08:43:43] <tilerendering> for some reason
[08:44:25] <tilerendering> maybe the path attribute is the problem? maybe Path property “/BackendAPI” should be completed with the domain and be set to Path: http://localhost/BackendAPI ? but I doubt that
[08:45:20] <Cork> no, / is local so it shouldn't be blocked
[08:45:38] <Cork> never had to fiddle with cookies for ajax calls though
[08:45:57] <Cork> it is normally the other way around (you login and ajax need the cookie)
[08:45:59] <tilerendering> hm, I just want to use it in order to store session relevant information for as long as the session cookie lives
[08:46:07] <Cork> and that works automatically
[08:46:17] <tilerendering> so that when the user opens a new tab
[08:46:23] <tilerendering> session relevant variables are preserved
[08:46:29] <tilerendering> I do not want to use localstorage for that
[08:46:35] <Cork> ya
[08:46:52] <Cork> you might have to do a page reload to set the window.cookies value
[08:47:13] <tilerendering> window.cookies? never heard of that, what is it good for?
[08:47:34] <Cork> when the page loads the server normally sends a coookie for the session
[08:47:42] <Cork> that gets stored there for the page
[08:48:06] <Cork> except its documend and singular -_-' https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie
[08:48:24] <tilerendering> maybe the problem is that I m having nginx proxying an app server in the front. so nginx will route the requests. and currently I have: proxy_pass_header set-cookie;
[08:48:24] <Cork> i really show i haven't fiddled with cookies for a long time >_>
[08:48:30] <Cork> no
[08:48:42] <Cork> it might be a cookie restricted to network only though
[08:48:55] <tilerendering> that would be httponly true then, which is not the case
[08:49:01] <tilerendering> how do you store variables across tabs?
[08:49:12] <Cork> you don't
[08:49:34] <Cork> modern browsers start to have serviceWorker, but you can't depend on it yet
[08:49:47] <tilerendering> that’s awful for single page apps
[08:49:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API
[08:50:16] <tilerendering> I mean I can of course store session relevant info on my backend api but that would mean I would implement session management in a goddamn database
[08:50:25] <Cork> well there is the sessionStorage and localStorage
[08:50:32] <tilerendering> both wont work across tabs
[08:50:38] <Cork> they do
[08:51:01] <Cork> unless you use something like anonymous tab or something like that
[08:51:25] <tilerendering> “Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause a new session to be initiated.”
[08:52:28] <tilerendering> what’s wrong with localstorage then? still, all those solutions are suboptimal because I really want the variables to live for only as long as the session cookie lives (and that is exactly the time during which the user is considered to be logged in)
[08:52:28] <Cork> well not really, it is more that the interface is broken so for performance the browser has to cache it so make it syncronous
[08:52:40] <Cork> so it is not one state
[08:53:06] <tilerendering> hm
[08:53:11] <Cork> tilerendering: you could have a look at indexedDB
[08:53:18] <Cork> it is async so it might not have that problem
[08:53:35] <tilerendering> what s the best way of finding out whether the cookie in question is actually persisted somewhere?
[08:53:52] <tilerendering> so that I can be sure it is not just thrown away or just a reference
[09:36:23] <KnightsOfNi> @cork - still here?
[10:02:59] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: been busy, give me a few minutes to straighten it out
[10:06:10] <KnightsOfNi> I haven't asked it yet :)
[10:07:02] <KnightsOfNi> I'm making a shopping cart... each item in the cart is a .row div with a data-id=PRODUCTID
[10:08:49] <KnightsOfNi> But now a product can have 'extras' - like 'extra mayonnaise' - 'extra pickles' - these extras also have an idea... would it be good to store those like this: data-extras="ID1|ID2|ID3|ID4" on the row div?
[10:08:55] <Cork> there
[10:08:56] <KnightsOfNi> and then send that to the server?
[10:09:03] <KnightsOfNi> or how would you do it?
[10:09:15] <Cork> i would recommend using json
[10:09:26] <Cork> then jquery will automatically parse it for you
[10:09:43] <Cork> so $().data('extra')[2]
[10:10:46] <Cork> if you store it as <elm data-id="" data-extras="[]"> or <etm data-options="{"id:"","extras":""}" is up to you (don't forget to entity encode the json)
[10:12:05] <KnightsOfNi> I don't understand... with json you mean to make it a form and put it as hidden fields and then serialize the form?
[10:12:13] <Cork> no
[10:12:33] <Cork> <div data-extras="[&#x22;ID1&#x22;,&#x22;ID2&#x22;,&#x22;ID3&#x22;,&#x22;ID4&#x22;]"></div>
[10:12:42] <Cork> $('div').data('extras')[0]
[10:12:49] <Cork> would be "ID1"
[10:13:06] <Cork> oh, lovely jsfiddle is broken >_>
[10:13:08] <KnightsOfNi> and then json enocd that?
[10:13:10] <KnightsOfNi> encode
[10:13:14] <Cork> that is json encoded
[10:13:30] <Cork> the content in data-extras is ["ID1","ID2","ID3","ID4"]
[10:13:40] <Cork> entity encoded json
[10:13:49] <KnightsOfNi> but you put it on the actual html element? Not just in the .data() thing, like we discussed earlier today?
[10:14:11] <KnightsOfNi> when a product with 5 extras is added
[10:14:11] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: are the data comming with the html or are you just storing it from js?
[10:14:35] <Cork> what i explained is if it comes with the html
[10:14:37] <KnightsOfNi> those ids come from the the product overview
[10:14:45] <KnightsOfNi> as hidden fields
[10:14:54] <Cork> else you can just do $().data('extras', idArray)
[10:15:17] <KnightsOfNi> ohh that's possible to have an array there
[10:15:28] <Cork> .data can stor anything you can point a variable at
[10:15:38] <KnightsOfNi> Ok I will try that
[10:15:39] <Cork> cause it IS basically just a variable
[10:15:56] <KnightsOfNi> I'm a bit hesitant about sending database ids - but ok
[10:16:05] <KnightsOfNi> my whole form is full of database ids
[10:16:13] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: ids shouldn't be sensitive :)
[10:16:23] <Cork> restful uses them exposed A LOT :)
[10:16:40] <KnightsOfNi> well they're not really sensitive, but they do give away how many records you have and such
[10:16:48] <Cork> not really
[10:16:59] <Cork> you can bump the number at random intervals if you like
[10:17:07] <KnightsOfNi> user_id = 4000 - this site has 4K users!
[10:17:12] <Cork> or start at a number other then 0
[10:17:19] <KnightsOfNi> or use guids
[10:17:24] <KnightsOfNi> would you do that?
[10:17:27] <Cork> no
[10:17:37] <Cork> sorting becomes a mess if you do
[10:17:43] <Cork> guids isn't sequensial
[10:18:04] <KnightsOfNi> if I could do random increases, it would be fine
[10:18:32] <Cork> just run an sql query against the database with a cronjob and modify AUTO_INCREMENT for the table
[10:19:04] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[10:19:32] <Cork> personally i would prob just grab a random number and start from that instead of 0
[10:19:39] <Cork> then leave it from there
[10:20:04] <Cork> ppl would have to know the starting number to know how many you have
[10:20:19] <Cork> also if records get removed it would sqeue anyway
[10:20:48] <KnightsOfNi> that's true
[11:19:23] <KnightsOfNi> How do I extract the values from a string like this? &options%5B%5D=300&options%5B%5D=306&options%5B%5D=288&options%5B%5D=295&options%5B%5D=312 - I'd need the id values
[13:34:28] <pokmo> hi
[13:34:32] <pokmo> i'm trying to use $.ajax
[13:35:01] <pokmo> my argument has a['success'] = function() {console.log("success!");}
[13:35:20] <pokmo> but after calling $.ajax(a), it doesn't print "success!"
[13:35:22] <pokmo> anyone know why?
[13:35:48] <robertmaxrees> pokmo is the ajax call actually succeeding?
[13:36:00] <pokmo> i *think* so
[13:36:24] <robertmaxrees> try agging an a.error = function() { console.log('fail') };
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> *adding
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> if you hit that, there's your answer.
[13:37:09] <pokmo> hmm nothing either
[13:37:17] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:37:24] <pokmo> nope
[13:37:26] <pokmo> all quiet
[13:37:33] <robertmaxrees> does your network tab even show the request firing?
[13:37:40] <pokmo> nope
[13:37:43] <pokmo> nothing at all
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> so then the ajax call isn't firing.
[13:38:02] <pokmo> oh gosh
[13:38:04] <pokmo> ignore me
[13:38:12] <pokmo> i'm at a breakpoint...
[13:38:14] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> :D
[13:38:18] <pokmo> thanks
[13:38:25] <pokmo> the ajax succeeds
[13:52:38] <SlimmPrimm> Hey guys
[13:53:13] <SlimmPrimm> I'm a bit stuck. I have an <ul> list with 16 <li> items and I need some jQuery way to only display 4 at a time
[13:53:17] <SlimmPrimm> With prev/next buttons
[13:53:27] <SlimmPrimm> So when next is clicked, show the next 4
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> SlimmPrimm any reason it has to be one ul with 16 lis in it
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:00:20] <SlimmPrimm> Yeah, the contents of it are pulled by the theme
[14:00:26] <SlimmPrimm> So I can't modify them easily
[14:00:32] <SlimmPrimm> robertmaxrees
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> SlimmPrimm yikes
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd break that out into a few divs and then you're basically making a carousel.
[14:01:14] <SlimmPrimm> Hm
[14:01:27] <SlimmPrimm> I think you're onto something
[14:01:31] <SlimmPrimm> But the contents vary
[14:01:42] <SlimmPrimm> I can set it up so there's say
[14:01:50] <SlimmPrimm> 4x4 divs
[14:01:59] <SlimmPrimm> But the fourth may contain 3 elements, or even none
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:02:05] <SlimmPrimm> So I need to hide the NEXT button
[14:02:12] <robertmaxrees> that's all pretty easy.
[14:02:14] <SlimmPrimm> If there's nothing in these divs
[14:02:15] <SlimmPrimm> Hm
[14:02:17] <SlimmPrimm> Thanks
[14:57:58] <tsukasadt> Is there an "easy" way to use jQuery to detect all content from one child to another? i.e., I want to to "select" everything from one H1 child to the next (excluding the next) and then do a $.wrapAll(). In the event of no more of the designated child, it would select all remaining children.
[15:00:14] <rapidecho> So apparently jQuery doesn't play well with CSS3's `column-count`? jQuery only seems to find the children in the first column of the div that has column-count set, and can't see any of the children in the subsequent columns. Is there a way around this?
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> rapidecho could you show what you mean in a fiddle?
[15:10:35] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt https://stackoverflow.com/a/863428/923919
[15:10:55] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt otherwise, I'd probably do something with slice() and the indexes of the elements in question.
[15:11:35] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I actually just finished writing this: https://jsfiddle.net/tsukasadt/aqs292Ld/
[15:12:41] <tsukasadt> Not quite what I wanted, but it works for my purposes.
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt fwiw the index gets passed to each()
[15:20:38] <rapidecho> robertmaxrees: It seems I may've blamed jQuery too soon. I made a codepen to demonstrate but the code pen worked just fine
[15:20:57] <rapidecho> Basically I'm getting weird behavior where Katex is displayed in one column but not the other
[15:21:09] <rapidecho> So I guess it's Katex's fault
[15:23:21] <robertmaxrees> well there you go :)
[15:27:32] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, This is basically what I'm trying to do: https://jsfiddle.net/tsukasadt/aqs292Ld/1/ Clearly I got it working, I was more curious about if there were a simpler/more efficient/proper way to do it. ^^'
[15:29:37] <robertmaxrees> there is!
[15:29:40] <robertmaxrees> .filter()
[15:30:25] <robertmaxrees> also: $.each(content.splitChildren('h1') - use the normal .each() for that.
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> though with .filter() you wouldn't need that at all :)
[15:54:33] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, could you show me how I'd use .filter() for it? From that I've read in the documentation, filter would pull out the designated tags, not allow me to group sections. :S
[15:56:05] <Stackoll> Hey guys
[15:56:19] <Stackoll> Very stuck on something, would really appreciate any help
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll just ask your question - if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:56:54] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt right, you get those, and then $('<div>').append(theResults);
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:57:01] <Stackoll> I need a way to change HTML contents of a div when another div is clicked
[15:57:10] <Stackoll> But it's a bit tricky
[15:57:16] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll can you show us in a fiddle?
[15:57:18] <Stackoll> Let me codepen it or something
[15:57:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:57:25] <robertmaxrees> that would be excellent.
[15:59:13] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/
[15:59:16] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[15:59:24] <Stackoll> Basically when a li item is clicked
[15:59:55] <Stackoll> I need the "maintitle" div text to change to the text inside the "swappable-title" div
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:00:05] <robertmaxrees> so - what have you tried? :)
[16:00:19] <Stackoll> I've found some solutions like this one
[16:00:37] <Stackoll> https://thepasteb.in/p/Z4hPRPDPYYGIG
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> that's close.
[16:01:15] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to fix the handler and then how you're grabbing the text.
[16:01:19] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic idea.
[16:01:21] <Stackoll> The problem is that this fires with "this" basically only working when the text itself is clicked
[16:01:22] <Stackoll> I need it to fire when a li is clicked
[16:01:22] <Stackoll> With the text inside that li only
[16:01:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:01:42] <robertmaxrees> you can bind a handler to the LI.
[16:01:58] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how to do that?
[16:02:15] <Stackoll> I can't edit any HTML because all this content is output by this weird plugin
[16:02:20] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:02:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to edit the html.
[16:02:27] <Stackoll> Ah
[16:02:27] <robertmaxrees> you can do all this with js.
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to bind a listener to a class?
[16:02:43] <Stackoll> Then I don't understand how to do that I suppose :/
[16:02:52] <Stackoll> No
[16:03:04] <robertmaxrees> so in that example you linked:
[16:03:05] <robertmaxrees> $(".rec1").click(function(event) {
[16:03:07] <robertmaxrees> see this?
[16:03:35] <Stackoll> Yep!
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think that's doing?
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:04:03] <Stackoll> Hm, basically "when .rec1 is clicked"
[16:04:10] <robertmaxrees> and what is .rec1 ?
[16:04:11] <Stackoll> do X
[16:04:21] <Stackoll> A CSS class
[16:04:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:04:28] <Stackoll> In this case my li item
[16:04:33] <robertmaxrees> so.
[16:04:41] <robertmaxrees> now do you see how to bind a listener to a class?
[16:04:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:04:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw classes aren't just for CSS.
[16:05:01] <Stackoll> Hm, so I simply replace .rec with my li?
[16:05:17] <robertmaxrees> or with your clickme class.
[16:05:28] <Stackoll> Ah, but it can't be the clickme class
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[16:06:04] <Stackoll> I'm not sure how best to explain - when the whole div box is clicked, I need this to happen
[16:06:11] <Stackoll> If I used the clickme class
[16:06:19] <Stackoll> Well, it would only fire when the title itself was clicked
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:25] <Stackoll> And the title has to stay hidden
[16:06:33] <Stackoll> I know :/
[16:06:35] <robertmaxrees> you're changing your story.
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> do you want this to happen when anywhere on the LI is clicked?
[16:07:29] <Stackoll> Yes
[16:07:41] <robertmaxrees> so then use the class on the LI.
[16:07:43] <Stackoll> Even when it's not the .clickme class
[16:07:45] <robertmaxrees> that's how you handle that.
[16:07:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:07:52] <Stackoll> Yes but there's
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean including all children, right?
[16:08:12] <Stackoll> There's about 10 identical li items
[16:08:12] <Stackoll> With identical class names
[16:08:21] <robertmaxrees> that's fine...
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> why would that be an issue?
[16:08:40] <robertmaxrees> you can easily get the text of the one you clicked.
[16:08:53] <robertmaxrees> and the handler will only fire for the single one you clicked.
[16:08:54] <Stackoll> Won't it try to replace it with all instances of "swappable-title"
[16:08:59] <Stackoll> Yes, just the one I clicked - that's what I need. But the pastebin I sent doesn't do that
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:09:08] <robertmaxrees> we'll fix that part :)
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> that's trivial.
[16:09:22] <Stackoll> Good to know :D
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> so start by binding that listener to the LIs.
[16:10:21] <Stackoll> One nanosec
[16:11:03] <Stackoll> Done
[16:11:09] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what youi've got now?
[16:11:50] <Stackoll> https://pastebin.com/vkPfMMBC
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/1/
[16:12:05] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle :)
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> so now what's next?
[16:12:28] <Stackoll> Ah, that makes sense
[16:12:54] <robertmaxrees> you need to replace the text in .maintitle with the text of the clicked LI, right?
[16:13:20] <Stackoll> Yep!
[16:13:29] <Stackoll> But the li has a lot of text in it that I don't need
[16:13:36] <robertmaxrees> okay, so refine that statement,.
[16:13:45] <Stackoll> So it only needs to be replaced with the text from the swappable-title div
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:13:52] <Stackoll> within the clicked li
[16:13:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:14:08] <Stackoll> Sorry, yeah, I understand this is relevant now
[16:14:14] <robertmaxrees> so.
[16:14:21] <Stackoll> Completely slipped my mind - my bad :/
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> you have three distinct operations you need to do there :)
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> 1) select the .swappable-title under the clicked LI. 2) grab said text. 3) replace the text in .maintitle
[16:16:35] <Stackoll> So far 2) and 3) i think are working okay: https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/3/
[16:17:05] <Stackoll> But I don't know how to select the .swappable-title under the currently clicked item
[16:17:06] <robertmaxrees> so .html() isn't what you wnat fwiw.
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> you want .text9)
[16:17:11] <robertmaxrees> * .text()
[16:17:29] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, you need to use .find()
[16:17:30] <Stackoll> Fixed
[16:17:51] <robertmaxrees> you can chain .find('selector') off any jquery object to find any descendent that matches your selector.
[16:19:41] <Stackoll> Like so?
[16:19:41] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/4/
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> that look like it's doing what you want? :)
[16:20:05] <robertmaxrees> also: use vars to make this even easier to read.
[16:20:17] <robertmaxrees> and also: do you really need event.preventDefault() in there?
[16:20:37] <Stackoll> Yeah, I think it's working! Thanks a lot!
[16:20:42] <Stackoll> I'm not sure what it does
[16:20:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:20:58] <Stackoll> I'm running a bunch of different events once this div is clicked
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not binding a bunch of separate handlers, are you?
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> also: easier to read - https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/6/
[16:22:36] <Stackoll> TBH I'm not sure myself
[16:22:47] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:22:57] <Stackoll> I got in something way over my head and I'm not very good with jQueyr
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> are you using .click a bunch of times on the same elements.
[16:23:10] <Stackoll> Yes, definitely
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's bad.
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:23:52] <Stackoll> It can cause conflicts?
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> it's sloppy heh.
[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> really hard to track down bugs.
[16:24:29] <robertmaxrees> and if you do enough it can cause performance issues.
[16:25:41] <Stackoll> Hmm
[16:26:00] <Stackoll> Well
[16:26:03] <Stackoll> It's a nightmare tbh
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:26:14] <Stackoll> I just landed a very nice job
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> :/
[16:26:37] <Stackoll> It's been understood I don't know jQuery
[16:26:37] <Stackoll> A client sent a very complex mockup
[16:26:51] <Stackoll> Foolishly I thought it can be done without any custom development, so I gave it the OK
[16:27:03] <robertmaxrees> your call.
[16:27:15] <Stackoll> The payments were made, the deadlines were set
[16:27:15] <Stackoll> Now once I've gotten into it
[16:27:17] <Stackoll> I have 2 days to create a fully custom video player
[16:27:31] <Stackoll> So sloppiness is OK I suppose
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> feel bad for the next person to work on it.
[16:27:50] <Stackoll> This one time :/
[16:28:14] <robertmaxrees> plus that reflects poorly on you since the question always comes up - "Who did this?!"
[16:28:18] <robertmaxrees> but hey, your choice :)
[16:29:00] <Stackoll> TBH you're right
[16:29:17] <Stackoll> I do php mostly, I hate sloppy solutions and avoid them like the plague
[16:29:43] <Stackoll> hm
[16:33:15] <Stackoll> Okay
[16:33:22] <Stackoll> Another tricky one if anyone knows how
[16:33:53] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:34:00] <Stackoll> So the text div that's changing on click
[16:34:10] <Stackoll> Also needs to already be changed to the very first value from the very first li class onload
[16:34:25] <robertmaxrees> also easy.
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> start by breaking the problem down :)
[16:34:38] <Stackoll> One nanosec
[16:34:44] <Stackoll> https://thepasteb.in/p/mwh1Y1ABqYqI5
[16:35:03] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:35:24] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said you needed to change the text in a div,.
[16:35:30] <Stackoll> It's basically a video element. The code above pulls a URL from the first grid item into it
[16:35:42] <Stackoll> This is something I've sorted already
[16:35:46] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:35:53] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting stuck?
[16:36:14] <Stackoll> What I've linked (althought I'm not sure what it does - just know that it works) works in replacing the video URL
[16:36:32] <Stackoll> But can I modify this to replace the text too?
[16:36:35] <robertmaxrees> look at the code and see if you can't decipher it :)
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> you won't be able to add to that code, no.
[16:36:51] <robertmaxrees> not to do what you want.
[16:37:06] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(".wp-video-shortcode").attr() is changing attributes on .wp-video-shortcode
[16:37:24] <robertmaxrees> however, jQuery(".video-playlist-item").eq(0).attr("moviesurl") - this should give you a hint.
[16:38:37] <Stackoll> I had an idea based on that
[16:38:42] <Stackoll> And did this
[16:39:03] <Stackoll> jQuery('.video-title').text(jQuery(".video-playlist-item").eq(0).find('.fl-post-title').text());
[16:39:12] <Stackoll> It's not working though
[16:39:13] <robertmaxrees> try relating it back to https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/6/
[16:39:14] <Stackoll> Hm
[16:39:18] <robertmaxrees> since i can't see your actual HTML.
[16:39:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:39:35] <Stackoll> That makes sense, thanks, one sec
[16:40:27] <Stackoll> Okay what
[16:40:32] <Stackoll> It works in the fiddle
[16:40:32] <Stackoll> :/
[16:40:32] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/m8j1knwk/7/
[16:40:46] <Stackoll> So I'm messing up somewhere on the site
[16:41:00] <robertmaxrees> does .maintitle exist on pageload?
[16:41:16] <Stackoll> Yep
[16:41:28] <robertmaxrees> and your code's in a doc ready?
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> no console errors?
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> etc.?
[16:42:58] <Stackoll> Wrong class >.<
[16:42:58] <Stackoll> Fixed it
[16:42:58] <Stackoll> Thank you so much
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[16:43:08] <Stackoll> You've helped me out incredibly
[16:43:13] <robertmaxrees> what we're here for :)
[16:43:30] <robertmaxrees> i might hit up http://learn.jquery.com one of these days.
[16:43:36] <Stackoll> I may keep this job yet
[16:45:04] <Stackoll> Ahhh I'll look it up
[16:45:11] <Stackoll> Definitely need to learn more
[16:45:14] <Stackoll> Much more
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> there's also try.jquery.com
[16:45:29] <Stackoll> Just got shoved into jQuery so fast so I'm scrapping for solutions
[16:45:44] <robertmaxrees> it's all goodf.
[16:45:46] <robertmaxrees> *good
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> luckily the api is relatively simple once you get used to it.
[16:47:01] <Stackoll> Nah man, folks like you are the reason there are good things on the internet. Truly appreciate it
[16:47:33] <Stackoll> I wouldn't have a career if I wasn't piggybacking off of people selflessly sharing solutions
[16:47:33] <Stackoll> Whether stackoverflow or in IRC
[16:53:20] <robertmaxrees> we all owe a lot back to the comminities that power the stuff that make our careers easier.
[17:30:15] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[17:30:38] <Stackoll> if you're still about
[17:30:38] <Stackoll> I have one last question
[17:32:08] <Stackoll> I'm trying to move this title div which we just used to replace the text
[17:32:20] <Stackoll> Inside mediaelement.js's mejs-controls div
[17:32:51] <Stackoll> Since there are several video players I'm trying to move it to the closest one, but it's buried as a child of a div of a div of a div
[17:34:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta show me what you've got  markup wise.
[17:38:31] <Stackoll> It's really messy
[17:38:31] <Stackoll> Basically this
[17:38:32] <Stackoll> fiddling it
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:39:27] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/1/
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> so...
[17:40:00] <Stackoll> The controls div is buried as a child of a million other divs
[17:40:10] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to move .video-data to its cloeset .mejs-controls?
[17:40:14] <robertmaxrees> *closest
[17:40:44] <Stackoll> Yep, pretty much!
[17:40:54] <robertmaxrees> and there are multiple .mycustomsolution elements?
[17:41:38] <Stackoll> No, thankfully not
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:41:57] <robertmaxrees> can you update the fiddle to show what multiples would look like?
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> because that might make things a little more painful...
[17:42:13] <Stackoll> Each video has a different class name
[17:42:13] <Stackoll> So I could target by that
[17:42:13] <Stackoll> Class ID
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> class OR id.
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:42:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/3/ is it something like this?
[17:43:07] <Stackoll> Basically this https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/4/
[17:43:30] <robertmaxrees> can you add a class to those two IDs?
[17:43:37] <Stackoll> No, the uppermost parent is different
[17:43:38] <Stackoll> Yep
[17:43:40] <Stackoll> Can do
[17:43:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/5/ like this.
[17:43:57] <robertmaxrees> or whatever name you want.
[17:44:18] <Stackoll> Hm, let me check just in case
[17:44:29] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise this is going to be a pain.
[17:44:45] <Stackoll> But I'm 99% I can
[17:44:59] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> for starters.
[17:45:15] <robertmaxrees> you want to treat each jQuery(".video-data") individually, right?
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> because they'll wind up in different places.
[17:45:40] <Stackoll> Yep, absolutely
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> rad.  so to do that
[17:46:11] <Stackoll> It can be done BTW
[17:46:12] <Stackoll> Just checked
[17:46:12] <Stackoll> So I'll go ahead and add the same class everywhere
[17:46:12] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to use .each() with jQuery(".video-data")
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> then, you'll need to get to that .video-container
[17:48:10] <Stackoll> Trying
[17:48:24] <robertmaxrees> lemme know if you get stuck.
[17:49:22] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:49:34] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/6/
[17:49:34] <Stackoll> Like so?
[17:50:25] <robertmaxrees> alright, back.
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll any luck?
[17:52:03] <Stackoll> Just this https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/6/
[17:52:03] <Stackoll> Looking into why prependTo isn't working
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> right so.
[17:52:22] <robertmaxrees> you have two issues.
[17:52:37] <robertmaxrees> first off,  jQuery(".video-data") is still getting all .video-data elements on the page.
[17:52:44] <robertmaxrees> remember earlier with the click handler?
[17:52:55] <Stackoll> Which ones?
[17:52:58] <Stackoll> Ah
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> so what did you do in the click handlers to say "the current thing"?
[17:55:35] <Stackoll> Like so?
[17:55:36] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/8/
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:55:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/9/
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> ignoring everything else for a second.
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> try to get the parent .video-container of $(this)
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> oh wait you're starting at video container.
[17:57:11] <robertmaxrees> y bad.
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> so select the descendent video-data of the current container.
[17:58:49] <Stackoll> Hmm
[17:58:50] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/10/
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> .find
[17:59:12] <Stackoll> Ah, sorry
[17:59:12] <Stackoll> it should be find
[17:59:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/11/.c
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> err, https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/11/
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[17:59:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you want to append that to?
[17:59:42] <robertmaxrees> or prepend it to, or whatever.
[18:00:14] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/13/
[18:00:16] <Stackoll> Like so?
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[18:00:35] <robertmaxrees> so now what did you want to do?
[18:02:11] <Stackoll> Hmm
[18:02:15] <Stackoll> Trying
[18:02:19] <Stackoll> My markup is likely off
[18:02:32] <robertmaxrees> try it in the fiddle first.
[18:02:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/14/ btw this has jquery added.
[18:03:03] <Stackoll> Yes, that's where I'm trying
[18:03:13] <Stackoll> Ah
[18:03:14] <Stackoll> Hm
[18:03:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:03:44] <Stackoll> Still trying :/
[18:03:51] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried so far?
[18:04:03] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/16/
[18:04:23] <robertmaxrees> still missing jquery on that one :)
[18:04:29] <Stackoll> Well I have this solution on stackoverflow
[18:04:29] <Stackoll> $("#source").prependTo("#destination");
[18:04:34] <Stackoll> So I've tried replacing
[18:04:34] <Stackoll> Ah
[18:04:55] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Idemamz.png
[18:05:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5oL36tnv/18/
[18:05:57] <Stackoll> Oh
[18:05:59] <Stackoll> Damn
[18:05:59] <Stackoll> Oh
[18:06:01] <Stackoll> I see
[18:06:10] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[18:06:16] <Stackoll> I'm embarassed to say I looked at that image
[18:06:16] <Stackoll> Way too long
[18:06:17] <robertmaxrees> are they where you want them?>
[18:06:43] <Stackoll> Should be! Testing live
[18:06:48] <robertmaxrees> rad
[18:11:13] <Stackoll> Hm
[18:11:16] <Stackoll> It's not working live
[18:11:22] <Stackoll> It's possible that mejs-controls
[18:11:26] <Stackoll> Is being generated later
[18:11:43] <Stackoll> I'll try to introduce a delay
[18:12:36] <Stackoll> mejs-controls is outside of my code
[18:14:28] <Stackoll> Not working agh
[18:23:21] <Stackoll> OK
[18:23:27] <Stackoll> I am the worst bootlegger of all the bootleggers
[18:23:33] <Stackoll> I've ran the script in the footer
[18:23:37] <Stackoll> And it worked
[18:29:07] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:29:08] <sumyunseal> umm
[18:29:10] <sumyunseal> no
[18:29:20] <sumyunseal> oh hey robertmaxrees
[18:29:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:30:19] <sumyunseal> im losing my scroll handler
[18:30:22] <sumyunseal> event
[18:30:33] <sumyunseal> .on(scroll)
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:30:44] <sumyunseal> when popup is opened the scrollbar disapears
[18:30:53] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like CSS.
[18:31:05] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees I think the .mejs-controller div is getting loaded later, because putting the script in the footer works - but only on the uppermost element on the page
[18:31:09] <sumyunseal> and the scroll event gets detached
[18:31:17] <Stackoll> So the video near the top works
[18:31:20] <sumyunseal> how do i find it again
[18:31:27] <grapheti> sounds like overflow: hidden
[18:31:27] <Stackoll> The video near the bottom of the page (with the same markup) won't work
[18:31:37] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll sounds like you have a race vondition maybe window load?
[18:31:51] <robertmaxrees> or you'll need to use a callback for those/
[18:33:35] <grapheti> or height of content not big enough for a scrollbar
[18:33:43] <Stackoll> Hm, how do I do that robertmaxrees
[18:33:59] <sumyunseal> no when i close popup scrollbar appears again
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you've pretty much validated it heh
[18:34:03] <sumyunseal> but even doesnt comeback
[18:34:35] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal are you trying to un-set overflow: hidden; in your JS somewhere?
[18:34:55] <sumyunseal> its a popup
[18:35:00] <sumyunseal> like a overlay
[18:35:11] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my question.
[18:35:23] <sumyunseal> i need answers
[18:35:32] <sumyunseal> comon guys
[18:35:33] <robertmaxrees> we can't help until we get more clarification.
[18:35:41] <sumyunseal> stop screwing about
[18:35:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:36:18] <Stackoll> wew
[18:37:10] <sumyunseal> hmm
[18:37:26] <sumyunseal> scrolbar comes back after i close popup
[18:38:22] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees window load doesn't work
[18:38:41] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll you'll need to start looking into callbacks then, I'm afraid.
[18:38:50] <robertmaxrees> or see if the plugin will help you costomize things at all.
[18:39:13] <Stackoll> Is that even doable considering that
[18:39:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:39:24] <robertmaxrees> depending.
[18:39:31] <Stackoll> the mejs player is beyond my reach?
[18:39:31] <Stackoll> The player which contains the div
[18:39:40] <Stackoll> It's integrated in Wordpress
[18:39:41] <robertmaxrees> does it offer a callback?
[18:40:20] <Stackoll> Looking up mediaplayer.js callback
[18:40:25] <Stackoll> Brings up nothing
[18:41:01] <robertmaxrees> got a link to the docs for the js thing you're using?
[18:41:26] <Stackoll> It should be this https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/docs/api.md
[18:41:52] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/docs/api.md#events
[18:42:54] <Stackoll> Okay, so these are things I'll need to edit somehow
[18:42:58] <Stackoll> Hm
[18:43:00] <robertmaxrees> not edit.
[18:43:07] <robertmaxrees> bind to
[18:43:10] <sumyunseal> its a fancybox overlay
[18:43:30] <Stackoll> Now I'm completely lost :/
[18:43:35] <Stackoll> Hm
[18:43:45] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll they're events.
[18:43:51] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll just like click is an event.
[18:44:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd try using .on() instead - .on('eventname', function() {})
[18:44:08] <sumyunseal> Stackoll, can you help me
[18:44:11] <robertmaxrees> see if that gets you anywhere.
[18:44:18] <Stackoll> sumyunseal I can try
[18:44:36] <Stackoll> One sec robertmaxrees
[18:44:40] <sumyunseal> fancybox is blocking my .scroll
[18:44:42] <Stackoll> Just trying
[18:45:14] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal because sommething is adding overflow: hidden; to it.
[18:45:16] <Stackoll> okay, so basically you can't scroll in the background once fancybox is opened?
[18:45:53] <Stackoll> whew
[18:47:06] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees I think I'm dumb but I can't understand. The video player JS is embedded into the WP version itself, I think. So if I am to change .on('eventname') I can't do this in my own JS file
[18:47:28] <Stackoll> I'd need to dig into the core files, right?
[18:47:30] <sumyunseal> no
[18:47:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> why can't you do use .on() in your own js?
[18:48:12] <sumyunseal> i am
[18:48:19] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll
[18:48:27] <Stackoll> Basically the div .mejs-controller where we've moved the .video-data earlier
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll okay?  and?
[18:48:40] <sumyunseal> i dont get why its not rebinding
[18:48:41] <Stackoll> This div seems to be loaded and generated by the mediaelement.js video player
[18:48:49] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal we can't help until we see more.
[18:49:03] <Stackoll> So the script which is doing this should be in the mediaelement.js file
[18:49:04] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll and?
[18:49:10] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll nope.
[18:49:32] <sumyunseal> when the fancybox is closed it should scroll again
[18:49:51] <Stackoll> sumyunseal did you try temporarily deleting all your CSS
[18:49:54] <Stackoll> Disabling plugins
[18:50:17] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll you can bind in your own js file.
[18:50:28] <Stackoll> Oh, hm
[18:50:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if those events bubble.
[18:51:12] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('theeventname', function() { console.log('foo') });
[18:51:18] <robertmaxrees> try this and see if it happens
[18:53:17] <Stackoll> Nothing :/
[18:54:40] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.dailymotion.com/player#player-api-methods
[18:54:41] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:54:52] <robertmaxrees> gotta use addEventListener on the player object itself.,
[18:54:56] <robertmaxrees> you might need to do some refactoring.
[18:55:08] <Stackoll> augh
[18:55:26] <Stackoll> sounds bad
[18:55:39] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:55:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:55:46] <Stackoll> wait
[18:55:51] <robertmaxrees> just effort.
[18:55:51] <Stackoll> I'm dumb as bricks
[18:55:54] <Stackoll> 0.1 nanosec
[18:57:12] <Stackoll> OK, my attempt just now didn't work
[18:57:21] <robertmaxrees> what was your attempt?
[18:57:37] <Stackoll> giving the .mejs-controls class name
[18:57:39] <Stackoll> To the titles
[18:57:43] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:57:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:57:50] <robertmaxrees> so backing WAAAAY up.
[18:57:59] <Stackoll> Because the video player has it's own script which hides the .mejs-controls based on a variety of events
[18:57:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying toi accomplish?
[18:58:03] <Stackoll> Well
[18:58:15] <Stackoll> There's a video player, it's controls are fading out when the video is paused
[18:58:36] <Stackoll> Generally detecting various events going on with the video and doing stuff based on those events
[18:58:45] <Stackoll> I have this custom content I'd like to be part of the controls
[18:59:02] <Stackoll> Hence moving the content into the controls - now the content is fading in/out when the video is paused/replayed
[18:59:26] <Stackoll> But
[18:59:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.  so you're trying to modify the player itself?
[18:59:42] <Stackoll> In a way
[18:59:51] <Stackoll> Just visually I suppose
[19:00:04] <Stackoll> Not the js that's running the real player
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not "in a way".
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> that's "yes"
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's what I mean.
[19:00:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't touch the JS files for stuff like that.
[19:01:14] <Stackoll> The issue I'm having is me being unable to open the actual mediaelement HTML to put my custom content in there
[19:01:16] <Stackoll> I mean, I could
[19:01:22] <Stackoll> But it's basically a plugin
[19:01:27] <Stackoll> Once they put an update out
[19:01:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:01:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:01:39] <Stackoll> I'm risking all kinds of trouble
[19:01:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:01:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't ever modify plugin source.
[19:01:55] <robertmaxrees> like, as a general rule of thumb.
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.dailymotion.com/player#player-customisation
[19:01:58] <Stackoll> Yeh
[19:02:05] <robertmaxrees> so here's your bigger issue.
[19:02:15] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to get the player to do stuff it's not really meant to do.
[19:02:40] <robertmaxrees> unless you use https://developer.dailymotion.com/tools/sdks#sdk-javascript
[19:02:47] <sumyunseal> im risking
[19:03:01] <Stackoll> Believe me, I know :/
[19:03:05] <Stackoll> This is the tip of the iceberg
[19:03:09] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll basically, you'll want to actually use the sdk at this point.
[19:03:19] <sumyunseal> y does it unbind my scroll
[19:03:21] <robertmaxrees> especially if you're planning on more customizations/etc.
[19:03:29] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal we can't know until we see a test case.
[19:03:40] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees this is what I'm using http://www.mediaelementjs.com/
[19:03:42] <Stackoll> tho
[19:04:08] <Stackoll> In all honesty
[19:04:16] <Stackoll> This is the first time I've heard of the term SDK in my life
[19:04:20] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll ...
[19:04:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:04:24] <Stackoll> The deadline is tomorrow and it's 1 AM now
[19:04:27] <Stackoll> Is it even worth trying?
[19:04:29] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[19:04:30] <robertmaxrees> uh.,
[19:04:34] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[19:04:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean, if you don't want to sleep.
[19:04:45] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[19:04:53] <Stackoll> I've made peace with that already but
[19:04:56] <Stackoll> What if I told you
[19:04:57] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/docs/api.md - contains links that go to https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/api
[19:05:02] <Stackoll> The questions I'm posting here
[19:05:11] <Stackoll> are customizations 1,2,3
[19:05:17] <Stackoll> From a list of about 60
[19:05:18] <sumyunseal> Stackoll, u wont make it
[19:05:29] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll you're kind of tempting fate there.
[19:05:36] <robertmaxrees> since you're not familiar with the SDK at all.
[19:05:48] <Stackoll> I got no choice mate
[19:05:58] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:06:00] <Stackoll> Too deep to pedal back
[19:06:00] <Stackoll> Ahhhhhhh
[19:06:01] <robertmaxrees> then good luck.
[19:06:04] <Stackoll> Panic mode
[19:06:10] <Stackoll> Can I do it without SDK?
[19:06:11] <Stackoll> Like
[19:06:15] <robertmaxrees> waaaait a sec.
[19:06:16] <Stackoll> Defer loading of some scripts?
[19:06:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah so.
[19:06:39] <robertmaxrees> so you're looking to customize the players, right?
[19:06:43] <Stackoll> Yeah
[19:06:44] <robertmaxrees> what's your source for the vidfeos?
[19:06:46] <robertmaxrees> *videos
[19:06:55] <Stackoll> Those are custom fields
[19:07:04] <Stackoll> So basically the client goes into the backend
[19:07:05] <robertmaxrees> what's your source for the videos?
[19:07:08] <Stackoll> Specifies the URL
[19:07:08] <robertmaxrees> FB, YouTube?
[19:07:14] <robertmaxrees> so from your own server?
[19:07:16] <Stackoll> On the server itself
[19:07:41] <Stackoll> mp4 and webm files
[19:08:22] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, you'll need to build this out yourself and use the SDK.
[19:08:36] <robertmaxrees> you said you're not really having any luck with what you've been doing up until now, right?
[19:09:19] <robertmaxrees> because this lib doesn't really seem to support customization outside of "just do it right the first time".
[19:09:27] <Stackoll> TBH I've made headway
[19:09:46] <Stackoll> The rest I think I can figure out somehow
[19:09:51] <Stackoll> But yeah
[19:10:00] <Stackoll> They've basically sent a fully custom video player solution
[19:10:16] <Stackoll> With playlists, related videos, custom fields, custom player events, swiping motions
[19:10:43] <Stackoll> We've told them that we can't do it within 2 days, if they rely on a plugin to handle the videos, it can be done
[19:10:51] <Stackoll> They send a link to a plugin  and a design
[19:11:00] <Stackoll> So I'm thinking "they've incorporated the plugin"
[19:11:04] <Stackoll> The plugin does nothing
[19:11:22] <Stackoll> And like an idiot I say yes before finding that out
[19:11:22] <Stackoll> So eh
[19:11:45] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[19:11:50] <Stackoll> I've set a timeout function
[19:11:57] <Stackoll> And forced it to load 10 seconds later
[19:12:02] <Stackoll> Just to check
[19:12:06] <Stackoll> It still isn't working
[19:12:27] <Stackoll> Is it possible that this is not a problem with the scripts clashing at all?
[19:13:54] <Stackoll> a timeout should fix this I'd reckon? Esp if it's 10 seconds long, I'd imagine everything in that player was loaded already
[19:21:22] <Stackoll> wait
[19:21:24] <Stackoll> wait
[19:21:26] <Stackoll> hold up
[19:21:33] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[19:21:39] <Stackoll> does .find work on hidden elements?
[19:23:22] <robertmaxrees> back
[19:23:31] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll yeah.
[19:23:37] <robertmaxrees> .find() works against the document entirely.
[19:23:46] <robertmaxrees> regardless of what the CSS is doing.
[19:24:03] <Stackoll> OK I am officially retarded
[19:24:08] <robertmaxrees> woah hey
[19:24:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:24:19] <robertmaxrees> *made a mistake
[19:24:21] <Stackoll> 1 sec
[19:25:27] <robertmaxrees> and the issue with timeouts is they're not guaranteed, plus you're going to wait an awfully long time for the page to update.  which is poor UX.
[19:26:05] <Stackoll> robert... my HTML structure was wrong
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> hah
[19:26:12] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[19:26:14] <Stackoll> I had a </div> where it shouldn't have been...
[19:26:21] <robertmaxrees> get it all fixed up then?
[19:26:25] <Stackoll> I think so
[19:26:31] <robertmaxrees> rad
[19:26:35] <Stackoll> Just re-checking
[19:26:43] <Stackoll> 1AM so I'm
[19:26:46] <Stackoll> last lap
[19:27:56] <Stackoll> Yes
[19:28:00] <Stackoll> My HTML was wrong
[19:28:01] <robertmaxrees> rad
[19:28:01] <Stackoll> God
[19:28:05] <Stackoll> Thank you for your patience
[19:28:08] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.
[19:28:11] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out :)
[19:28:30] <Stackoll> Thanks
[19:28:37] <Stackoll> Just 3 more dumb features to go
[19:28:50] <Stackoll> Then I can try the rest in the morning
[19:29:19] <Stackoll> This whole site is like a bootleg Frankenstein
[19:33:24] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[19:33:33] <Stackoll> You seem like someone who knows his stuff
[19:33:38] <Stackoll> In your professional opinion
[19:33:42] <Stackoll> From what you've seen here
[19:33:56] <Stackoll> Are all these solutions we've tried
[19:34:18] <Stackoll> Going to be risky and cause a lot of issues down the road? What do you reckon?
[19:34:27] <robertmaxrees> honestly?
[19:34:40] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're hacking a lot of things in which is going to cause some headaches.
[19:34:49] <Stackoll> Moving a div to another div on pageload
[19:34:53] <Stackoll> Hm
[19:34:54] <robertmaxrees> you're modifying things on pageload and using js as a bandaid.
[19:35:04] <Stackoll> Yeah, pretty much, good comparison
[19:35:31] <Stackoll> I'm not familiar enough with how browsers respond to jQuery
[19:35:39] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[19:35:58] <Stackoll> If it's possible for this code to not run
[19:36:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:36:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:36:13] <Stackoll> Or something...
[19:36:13] <robertmaxrees> it's just js.s
[19:36:17] <Stackoll> Sorry, been up at this since 9 AM
[19:36:26] <robertmaxrees> *so long as the code's there, the browser will try to run it.
[19:36:46] <Stackoll> Can't quite put it together. This poor code may affect loading times I'm assuming, and future development
[19:36:57] <Stackoll> But generally the frontend should be working fine?
[19:36:58] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[19:37:06] <robertmaxrees> it'll impact the perceived load time.
[19:37:12] <robertmaxrees> which is distinct from the actual load time.
[19:37:17] <robertmaxrees> it may or may not function.
[19:37:21] <robertmaxrees> I haven't actually seen the site.
[19:37:43] <robertmaxrees> and there's a lot that goes into an evaluation beyind just "from these few snippets", y'know?
[19:37:57] <Stackoll> From what I see it's surprisingly working so far... In Chrome, moz, IE, android
[19:38:03] <Stackoll> True
[19:38:03] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.
[19:38:06] <robertmaxrees> it'll "function".
[19:40:17] <Stackoll> Well, I suppose that'll have to do for now
[19:54:02] <Stackoll> robertmaxrees
[19:54:07] <Stackoll> Can I pester you one final time
[19:54:14] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask :)
[19:54:16] <Stackoll> This is the last one
[19:54:25] <Stackoll> I've managed to solve all the other ones :D
[19:54:25] <robertmaxrees> ask your question - if somebody can help, they will :)
[19:54:43] <Stackoll> Fiddling it :)
[19:56:11] <sumyunseal> alright gaize
[19:56:15] <sumyunseal> figures
[19:56:26] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:56:31] <sumyunseal> change $(window to $(document
[19:56:34] <sumyunseal> and works
[19:56:56] <sumyunseal> no need to even disable the scroll locking on overlay
[19:57:38] <robertmaxrees> uh, okay?
[19:57:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:57:51] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[19:58:14] <Stackoll> https://jsfiddle.net/kes2mxuh/
[19:58:38] <Stackoll> Basically what I'm trying to achieve here is to only show 4 blocks
[19:58:50] <Stackoll> Next scrolls to the next 4
[19:58:51] <Stackoll> Previous goes back
[19:59:05] <sumyunseal> sumyunseal, 1 Stackoll 0
[19:59:07] <sumyunseal> :D
[19:59:09] <Stackoll> There are going to be 9 - 12 max at any time
[19:59:23] <Stackoll> I solved my issue matey
[19:59:31] <sumyunseal> damit
[19:59:33] <Stackoll> 99 left tho
[19:59:45] <Stackoll> Joking, last one
[19:59:55] <sumyunseal> cheers mate
[19:59:57] <robertmaxrees> Stackoll so you want a carousel.
[20:02:58] <Stackoll> I think so, looking for "carousel" solutions doesn't bring up much on stackoverflow though
[20:03:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:03:08] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup at all?
[20:04:39] <Stackoll> Not much sadly
[20:04:44] <robertmaxrees> :/
[20:04:46] <Stackoll> I can add classes and remove them
[20:04:47] <Stackoll> But
[20:04:55] <Stackoll> If I modify one class
[20:05:00] <Stackoll> They will all modify
[20:05:13] <robertmaxrees> "they" being...?
[20:05:24] <Stackoll> So basically anything I do/add to the .childclass reflects on all .childclass elements
[20:05:29] <robertmaxrees> ....
[20:05:32] <robertmaxrees> well yeah....
[20:05:42] <robertmaxrees> this is getting automatically generated I would assume.
[20:05:53] <robertmaxrees> so your fix here is a lot of CSS.
[20:05:56] <robertmaxrees> and a little js.
[20:06:03] <Stackoll> Yeah :/
[20:06:03] <Stackoll> Hm
[20:06:06] <Stackoll> That I can do
[20:06:16] <Stackoll> :nth-child?
[20:06:29] <robertmaxrees> why do you think n-th child is useful?
[20:06:56] <Stackoll> Not sure, I'm assuming I can target the first four divs etc. with it
[20:07:15] <Stackoll> To make them visible initially
[20:07:23] <robertmaxrees> also: you're going to have a helluva time getting this to work.
[20:07:29] <Stackoll> Ouch
[20:08:00] <Stackoll> Well, I'm prepared
[20:08:56] <robertmaxrees> so your first goal is going to be to get all those .childclass elements to display horizontally.
[20:09:23] <Stackoll> Ah, and overflow their parent?
[20:09:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:09:35] <robertmaxrees> then set margins and whatnot.
[20:12:22] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/443700/div-with-horizontal-scrolling-only
[20:12:27] <robertmaxrees> for the css portion.
[20:12:37] <sumyunseal> i wonder y window.on vs docuemnt.on would make a diff
[20:12:50] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal depends on the event,.
[20:12:56] <sumyunseal> scroll
[20:13:18] <robertmaxrees> generally you want window for that if it's for the whole page.
[20:13:27] <sumyunseal> i read fancybox does thing with wheel
[20:13:43] <robertmaxrees> though the APIs between document and window can cause some confusion.
[20:13:59] <Stackoll> On it robertmaxrees
[20:19:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm off to home.
[20:19:59] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
