[02:40:39] <loganlee> hello can someone have a look at this? https://codepen.io/logan-lee/pen/BaadBxg
[02:41:42] <loganlee> i need to fix the dropdown menu
[03:56:35] <ringzer0> anyone see anything wrong with this tertiary assignment operator fail https://pastebin.com/Jku5ypMy
[03:58:29] <Cork> 'false' will always be true
[03:58:40] <Cork> you don't compare it with anything
[03:58:52] <ringzer0> got it; thanks.
[04:04:49] <loganlee> dropdown menu items they overlap https://codepen.io/logan-lee/pen/BaadBxg
[04:05:37] <loganlee> also sub items are not in line with parent item
[04:06:44] <loganlee> ringzer0, 'false' is a non-empty string therefore it is true
[07:28:11] <loganlee> hello any1 know about this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58590013/nested-menu-items-overlap-each-other
[08:03:23] <Cork> loganlee: should prob ask in bootstrap about there widgets
[09:08:40] <Paradisee> hello
[09:08:57] <Paradisee> i'm having a "getAttribute" error on IE 11, how can i fix it?
[09:11:17] <Cork> Paradisee: how long is a rope...
[09:11:30] <Paradisee> :O
[09:11:32] <Cork> that question is completely impossible to answer without context
[09:12:54] <Paradisee> ie does not support getAttribute
[09:12:57] <Paradisee> that's the erorr
[09:14:59] <Cork> what you do what?
[09:15:10] <Cork> that is the context
[09:27:48] <Paradisee> i do nothing
[09:28:09] <Paradisee> i'm using a web component
[09:28:31] <Paradisee> but it's not related to the one i'm using
[09:28:39] <Paradisee> the error points to jquery
[09:31:27] <Cork> well i need to know what your doing to be able to guess what causes it
[09:31:56] <Cork> also what version of jquery are you using?
[09:32:26] <Cork> (shouldn't affect ie11 though...)
[10:23:20] <Paradisee> Cork: kinda difficault to explain
[10:23:36] <Paradisee> all i know is that i get this error
[10:23:52] <Cork> well jquery won't thorw that on it's own
[10:24:05] <Cork> so without knowing what you call into it to get the error, i can't really help you
[10:24:14] <Paradisee> i don't own a window machine so i can't tell you more about right now
[10:24:34] <Cork> if you know your code you shouldn't need it
[10:24:39] <Paradisee> where ever i click i get that error
[10:24:40] <Cork> the stacktrace should point at what your calling
[10:24:54] <Paradisee> it's not my code that's the point
[10:25:05] <Cork> yes it is
[10:25:10] <Paradisee> i mean, my code don't cause that error, it's someone else code that does
[10:25:18] <taplar> *that you support
[10:25:27] <Cork> sure the crash might happen in jquery, but it comes from what you call
[10:25:37] <Cork> and most of the time, from what you ask jquery to process
[10:25:48] <Paradisee> i would love to give you more information but i can't
[10:25:59] <Cork> then there isn't much we can do either
[10:26:06] <Paradisee> i need someone with a window pc near me
[10:26:17] <Paradisee> acutally everyone is working
[10:26:31] <Cork> "something somewhere happens when something calls something (probably related to jquery)" is absolute nothing to work with
[10:26:45] <Paradisee> i understand
[10:27:11] <Paradisee> another problem i'm getting is the type date on an input
[10:27:20] <Paradisee> on IE wont' work
[10:27:30] <Cork> ie doesn't support newer html
[10:27:42] <Cork> edge does, but not ie
[10:27:57] <Cork> if it isn't in html 4 your out of luck
[10:30:37] <Cork> best option might be to just drop old ie support
[10:31:20] <Cork> heck not even microsoft support ie11 anymore
[10:31:37] <Cork> (as you can only get it through win7)
[10:32:53] <Cork> huh, rememberd wrong was default browser in win8 too
[10:33:15] <taplar> i've forgotten win8 was a thing
[10:33:20] <Cork> :D
[10:33:31] <Cork> ya, haven't run windows in a few years my self
[10:33:39] <Cork> win7 was my last windows install
[10:33:49] <Cork> well, except for servers that is
[10:34:06] <taplar> win7 has been my last home install.  haven't built a new rig yet to force me to upgrade
[10:34:34] <taplar> and too many games for me to drop windows entirely
[10:34:48] <Cork> ya, moved completely to linux about 3-4 years ago, from a dual install
[10:35:29] <taplar> heh, my home box is a win7 that all it has are games on it, and a vmware instance of linux mint that I do everything else in
[10:36:01] <Cork> ya, used to be the same where, except i had a separate install instead of a vm for linux
[10:36:20] <Cork> but when the linux graphic stack got good enough i just dropped the windows install and ya
[10:36:38] <taplar> i tried the dual boot option, but I kept messing upgrades up and messing up my boot
[10:37:03] <Cork> that was only a thing in older windows installs
[10:37:23] <Cork> from win7 microsoft got quite good at not fucking up the boot settings
[10:37:45] <Cork> been dual booting since win98 so :)
[10:37:58] <Cork> was A LOT messier back then...
[10:38:06] <taplar> i can imagine
[10:38:39] <Cork> then you basically had to keep a backup of the boot menu as each windows update would make the linux systen unbootable
[10:39:15] <Cork> but from windows 2k that went to rarely happening, and win7 made it never as far as i remember
[10:39:41] <Cork> well unless you ran recovery that is :)
[10:42:29] <Cork> Paradisee: btw you know microsoft provides free ie compatibility images right?
[10:42:46] <Cork> could spin up a vm and test the problem personally
[10:43:22] <Paradisee> i'm gonna let others do this work
[11:05:26] <taplar> interesting.  IE marketshare is around 2.23% now
[11:07:15] <taplar> 3.52% when scope reduced to the SU
[11:07:16] <taplar> *US
[12:42:31] <shoky> i'm still supporting a site that only works "good" in IE, quirks mode. so like.. IE6 equivalent or smth :S
[12:44:06] <shoky> it actually warns you if you're not using IE :|
[12:46:19] <taplar> oh wow
[12:50:00] <shoky> it's also using an ancient IBM http server that only supports TLS 1.0  which is gonna stop working in a few months (at least in firefox?)
[12:50:09] <shoky> i gotta find a way to update that shit
[12:50:38] <shoky> i suppose it doesn't matter for IE tho
[12:51:15] <shoky> but limited functionality does work on modern browsers so i do want to support that :\
[12:51:34] <taplar> not a system that has to meet credit card standards, i take it
[12:51:50] <shoky> heh nah
[12:51:55] <shoky> this crap  https://www.radiopoint.net
[12:52:06] <shoky> not that you can login. but you can see the warning ;p
[12:52:27] <shoky> you can probably login also if you try to hack it for 10 minutes
[12:52:48] <taplar> if only i was still in my teens, heh
[12:52:56] <shoky> heh
[12:53:31] <taplar> hmm, i don't see a warning in firefox
[12:53:52] <shoky> really. i do..
[12:54:05] <shoky> https://i.imgur.com/FCKhBx0.png
[12:54:16] <shoky> maybe you waited till it disappears
[12:55:36] <taplar> ah, yeah that was it.  for some reason my network is being super slow loading some pages.  looks like it went away by the time i got back to it.
[12:55:55] <agile_prg> I want to make an editable table with jquery and bootstrap, can anyone assist?
[12:56:21] <taplar> @agile_prg depending on what you're after, you can do that with plain html
[12:56:33] <taplar> with the contenteditable attribute i believe
[12:56:53] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable
[12:57:58] <agile_prg> hi taplar, thanks for answering, I know I "could" do it with pure html etc... just trying to avoid massive amounts of effort/coding
[12:58:18] <agile_prg> a simple plugin that allows for editing would be ideal, even a kind of spreadsheet would be great
[12:58:18] <shoky> ;D https://i.imgur.com/hluOSMi.png
[12:58:19] <taplar> I mean, an attribute on a td seems like very little code?
[12:59:26] <agile_prg> jexcel looks pretty cool
