[15:23:47] <goddard> hey
[15:23:59] <goddard> how can i see if a <tr> has an attribute?
[15:24:05] <robertmaxrees> which attribute?
[15:24:08] <goddard> sometimes it exists and sometimes it doesn't
[15:24:20] <goddard> my own
[15:24:28] <robertmaxrees> so a data attribute?
[15:24:38] <goddard> it can be i guess
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> (you're technically not supposed to create your own custom attributes)
[15:24:47] <robertmaxrees> if it's a data attribute, then .data('foo')
[15:24:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, .prop('id') or w/e.
[15:25:01] <goddard> ok
[15:25:38] <goddard> if(!$(this).prop('no_click')) {
[15:25:50] <goddard> i basically wanna be able to set tr elements in a table that aren't clickable
[15:26:01] <robertmaxrees> with the existence of a custom attribute?
[15:26:05] <goddard> ya
[15:26:19] <robertmaxrees> use css for that.
[15:26:29] <goddard> what do you mean?
[15:26:33] <robertmaxrees> .noClick { pointer-events: none; }
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> then add the class noClick to any elements you don't want the user to click.  bam done.
[15:26:53] <goddard> ok
[15:26:55] <goddard> $('#all-quiz-table tr').on('click', function() {
[15:26:59] <goddard> that wont grab it?
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:27:13] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[15:27:24] <goddard> just a table with clickable rows
[15:27:31] <goddard> doing ajax when clicked
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> sure - can you make a fiddle?
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> the issue i'm having is you're adding/changing requirements as i'm trying to answer your question :)
[15:31:42] <goddard> its really simple to check if a value is set in php
[15:31:50] <goddard> not really sure how to do it in jquery
[15:32:02] <goddard> i console.log the attr and it is undefined
[15:32:11] <goddard> i check if it == undefined and it doesn't work
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> why not set a class and check for the existence of the class in the click handler then?
[15:32:34] <robertmaxrees> if i'm understanding your question.
[15:33:07] <goddard> ok i can do that
[15:35:40] <goddard> ok thanks im an idiot i was putting it on the wrong row when testing
[15:36:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:38:45] <robertmaxrees> goddard fwiw the jsfiddle didn't need to be all that complicateD: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yjn4Lpck/ :)
[15:38:52] <robertmaxrees> takes all of 60 seconds ot make.
[15:52:02] <goddard> sure
