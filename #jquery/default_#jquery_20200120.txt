[03:30:47] <tibyan_> hello all, when i submit this form https://pastebin.com/bq9dxHt2 ... entered values like CardNumber, ... are cleared on submit, any ideas?
[03:31:58] <tibyan_> hello all, when i submit this form https://pastebin.com/bq9dxHt2 ... entered values like CardNumber, ... are cleared on submit, any ideas?
[03:32:40] <Cork> the server has to set the value in the fields when it response with the new form
[03:33:07] <Cork> form values are only cept when you do ajax submits, as it doesn't reload the page
[03:36:13] <tibyan_> Cork: is there a way to get values from form before submit and send them on submit?
[03:38:47] <Cork> not in a page reload, as javascript is restarted
[03:39:03] <Cork> (it is a new page load after all)
[03:39:16] <Cork> well... except you could possibly store it in localstore and then set it on load
[03:39:28] <Cork> but that would be on any page load after... wouldn't recommend it
[03:41:14] <tibyan_> Cork: also credit card info shouldn't be in localstore.. have to filled before submit
[03:41:28] <Cork> ug, ya definitely
[03:41:46] <Cork> so ya, two options use ajax or config the server to put the values back
[03:42:54] <tibyan_> OK, how to do that?
[03:46:09] <Cork> uh, the server code that generates the new html fields puts the values in them?
[03:46:54] <Cork> or if you mean ajax https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[04:09:38] <tibyan_> Cork: I used event.preventDefault(); on submit but doesn't work.. is there a way to save values in js file
[04:09:56] <tibyan_> and submit them back
[04:10:00] <Cork> no
[04:10:21] <Cork> as javascript is garbage collected by the browser when the page unloads
[04:10:28] <Cork> so what ever you stores there will be lost
[04:10:52] <tibyan_> ok .. give me example with ajax
[04:11:18] <Cork> you will have to read up on the basics
[04:11:23] <tibyan_> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/two-or-more-form-submit-buttons-value
[04:11:25] <Cork> i linked you to a tutorial before
[04:11:27] <tibyan_> read this
[04:24:31] <pavonia> Also relevant: https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[17:56:13] <sydbarret> how can I scrape this table? https://propertydevelopment.ssc.nsw.gov.au/T1PRPROD/WebApps/eproperty/P1/eTrack/eTrackApplicationSearchResults.aspx?Field=D&Period=LM&Group=DA&SearchFunction=SSC.P1.ETR.SEARCH.DA&r=SSC.P1.WEBGUEST&f=SSC.ETR.SRCH.DLM.DA
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> have more of a problem statement?
[17:56:34] <sydbarret> it has paginated pages
[17:56:40] <robertmaxrees> like, what are you going to be using this for?
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do this via the client or using some kind of server?
[17:57:06] <sydbarret> robert you talking to me?
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> :")
[17:57:35] <sydbarret> im just using python requests
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> ah - wrong channel then.,
[17:57:41] <sydbarret> but it has js
[17:57:43] <robertmaxrees> *then
[17:57:58] <sydbarret> is the correct channel because i cant realize how to ge the url
[17:58:05] <sydbarret> since the url remains same when i ckick
[17:58:07] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript would be a better bet.
[17:59:34] <sydbarret> jquery and js are quite similar you must know
[17:59:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery is written in js.
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> but that's not what's handling the pagination here.
[17:59:50] <sydbarret> what i think is that i have to supply 2 more arguments?
[17:59:52] <robertmaxrees> so you're doubly wrong :)
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> notice how the page fully reloads when you press a page?
[18:00:34] <sydbarret> <a href="javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$Content$cusResultsGrid$repWebGrid$ctl00$grdWebGridTabularView','Page$2')">2</a>
[18:00:46] <sydbarret> i downloaded postman
[18:01:00] <sydbarret> to try to post the main url with those 2 arguments
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, open up you dev tools and check out the post bodies of a few pages and go from there.
[18:01:07] <sydbarret> but the response are just the same  first page
[18:01:17] <robertmaxrees> because the form body likely requires more.
[18:01:58] <sydbarret> more than those 2 args?
[18:02:04] <robertmaxrees> mmhmm
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> iu
[18:02:17] <robertmaxrees> *i'm seeing 6 in the post body.
[18:03:12] <robertmaxrees> so really, you're looking at the rudiments of dealing with form here.
[18:03:14] <robertmaxrees> *forms here
[18:03:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd start with the basics outlined here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data
[18:05:14] <sydbarret> you mean i have to send 4 more parameters besides __EVENTTARGET and __EVENTARGUMENT ?
[18:05:22] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:05:35] <robertmaxrees> read the guide above and check out your dev tools for more information.
[18:05:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, we're way off topic for this channel.  hopefully that gets you started!
[18:11:20] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees but do you think its possible to retrieve the real urls?
[18:11:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:11:43] <robertmaxrees> it's the same URL, just a different post body.
[18:12:01] <robertmaxrees> check out the network requests, read up on the basics of dealing with forms, and you'll figure it out.
[18:12:15] <robertmaxrees> either way, this has nothing to do with jquery :) moving on!
[18:12:15] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees  questions is will it be possible to enter each page and scrape
[18:12:37] <robertmaxrees> yes.  now let's move on and get back to the topic.  thanks!
[18:12:38] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees enter javascript channel
[18:12:42] <robertmaxrees> i already did.
[18:12:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm choosing to not answer because the issue isnt' javascript.
[18:12:56] <robertmaxrees> :) happy hacking.
[18:13:05] <sydbarret> hah
[18:13:19] <sydbarret> do i have to inspect network js?
[18:13:27] <sydbarret> it says initiator column
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> that sentence doesn't make sense.  either way - moving on :)
[18:13:36] <sydbarret> and has some like ports in the url
[18:13:45] <robertmaxrees> please find a more suitable place to ask.
[18:14:03] <sydbarret> where should I ask then?
[18:14:09] <sydbarret> these stuff is interrelated
[18:14:21] <robertmaxrees> it has nothing to do with jQuery :)
[18:14:35] <sydbarret> send me a pvt msg with the answer so I can save a couple of hours
[18:14:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't offer support over pm :/
[19:59:46] <sydbarret> robertparkerx you can join html I have provided all the parameters but doesnt work
[20:00:40] <sydbarret> I even tried the d: and t: query string parameter from network tab headers
