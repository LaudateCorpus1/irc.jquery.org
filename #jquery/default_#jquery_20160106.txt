[00:14:34] <ZeuZ> Guys, I'm having a problem with .on('click',function(){}); being triggered only sometimes
[00:14:47] <ZeuZ> Can somebody give a look at it?
[00:16:13] <ZeuZ> The responsable code for that part is: http://ideone.com/vsRP4A
[00:16:26] <ZeuZ> it should bring a "custom" context menu based on:
[00:16:36] <ZeuZ> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4495626/making-custom-right-click-context-menus-for-my-web-app
[00:17:01] <ZeuZ> but the click on 'menu-contextual li' is not always triggered
[00:17:16] <ZeuZ> erhm, make that '.menu-contextual li'
[00:20:45] <unnotused> how do i make a FormData() object with the current form values listed? i.e.  on submit( "// get values from form and store them in formdata object ")    ,   ajax form information
[00:27:56] <stanmancan> Any idea why on a mobile device http://villagespizza.xyz/ the graphics don't show up until you expand the menu?
[00:45:09] <knight2131> Hello, I need you help please.. I've 3 associative arrays and I want to send them in 1 json to my server but I can't get it to work? can someone please help me with that...
[00:49:07] <phiz_> knight2131: so make an array of the arrays
[00:56:28] <knight2131> phiz_: can you give me example how to create array of multiple assotive arrays?
[01:12:04] <dopie> hey guys can someone help me here
[01:13:12] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/2bd61898a6aecaa81288
[01:13:12] <dopie> im getting $fnLn is not a function
[01:13:12] <dopie> .each
[01:13:12] <dopie> what am i doing wrong?
[01:24:20] <arup_r> Here is a simple testcase of my problem, https://jsfiddle.net/07nmzj95/9/ .. You see there as I have bounded the click 3 times, the text "Test" is getting added 3 times on click. I want that click to add only 1 time evenif the click handler on `.outer` was bounded more than once. I used the `.bind()` and `.unbind()` method, but couldn't handle it..
[01:24:28] <arup_r> Any pointer ?
[01:24:47] <rcyr> dopie: An array doesn't have a each method.
[01:25:05] <rcyr> dopie: Use $.each($fnLn, function........
[01:25:59] <dopie> ahhhh ok
[01:30:45] <arup_r> here is the solution I tried, https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/2/ .. but it didn't help problem is: https://jsfiddle.net/07nmzj95/9/
[01:36:37] <arup_r> ok fixed it https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/5/ .. some closure thing ..
[01:38:12] <arup_r> This is fixed and expected code https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/5/ .. and this was the bug https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/2/ .. Now, my question is why https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/4/ didn't solve the issue ?
[01:38:22] <arup_r> I am messing with closure of JS it seems..
[01:38:35] <arup_r> Please help me to understand this concept
[01:43:36] <arup_r> nvm, I got it.. both https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/6/ and https://jsfiddle.net/tncL2xs5/5/ will work.
[01:48:45] <One3yed> 2 days wasted learning polymer, just for something Materialize could of done... =(
[02:14:27] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/cd06fhg4/17/
[02:14:44] <dopie> im trying to do somewhere where if both are true in the else statement, do somehting
[02:38:28] <hellyeah> hey anyone around
[02:39:03] <hellyeah> i tyr to add title to insidebody to show dialog box in insidebody can you check line4 why is it not working http://jsfiddle.net/qmfjshLd/8/
[03:09:38] <dopie> hey guys i have a question
[03:09:40] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/cd06fhg4/55/
[03:09:56] <dopie> when you click on a input box and then enter in text it works fine...
[03:10:07] <dopie> my question is if you GO BACK and then enter more text
[03:10:11] <dopie> it still +1
[03:10:24] <dopie> how can i change it where if there is text already there it doesnt +1 ?
[04:59:43] <DreamStiffler> hi guys. Im trying to changed any small letter entered to Uppercase in the field as the user type. How do i do this? Where do i insert it? : https://jsfiddle.net/4vyv29we/
[05:01:55] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: question
[05:02:24] <wa5ted> https://jsfiddle.net/4vyv29we/1/
[05:02:28] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: ^ this work?
[05:09:34] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: exactly. thanks. now i need to compare. cheers
[05:09:44] <wa5ted> sure
[05:09:51] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: not so fast
[05:10:08] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: too easy. my God
[05:10:16] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: what do you mean not so fast?
[05:10:35] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: if you want comparison, remember the css property only applies to the styling
[05:10:37] <wa5ted> not the actual value
[05:10:43] <wa5ted> if you tes teh value it will be still lower case
[05:10:44] <wa5ted> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase
[05:10:51] <wa5ted> ^ this might be a bit better to use
[05:11:20] <wa5ted> so while the CSS handles showing the text as uppercase, that method handles it when you compare, and typically comparisons are done in lowercase
[05:11:23] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: ^
[05:11:30] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: why so?
[05:11:44] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: i was trying to do that but wasnt sure which or what tod o
[05:11:53] <wa5ted> well what sthe en goad
[05:11:54] <wa5ted> goal*
[05:18:03] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: does that link help?
[05:20:12] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: like what you gave ...meaning allowing user to key in small letters but appear as capital
[05:20:38] <wa5ted> yup
[05:20:45] <wa5ted> but you mentioned something aobut comparing
[05:20:50] <wa5ted> DreamStiffler: thats why i said not so fast
[05:21:05] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: oh nothing...i thought you were giving me jquery scripts
[05:21:29] <DreamStiffler> wa5ted: so i didnt see any comments...i thought i need to compare with my previous code to see the difference
[05:41:23] <cjdc> hi everyone. quick question about jquery autocomplete
[05:42:53] <cjdc> $("#div").autocomplete({source: myvar, minLength:2}).data("ui-autocomplete")._renderItem = function (ul, item) { return $("<li></li>")                     .data("item.autocomplete", item)                     .append("some text")                     .appendTo(ul); };
[05:43:27] <cjdc> shouldn't "some text" appear together with each suggestion on the autocomplete box?
[05:45:42] <dan_j> I'm using jquery animate. It's working fine in most places, but in one place, there is a delay when the animate line is executed before the animation actually starts.
[05:46:10] <dan_j> There is an identical animation using code thats been copied and pasted and runs fine.
[05:46:37] <dan_j> What could delay an animation from starting, or how can I debug it? Debugging the code doesnt help me because it just pauses on the animate line.
[05:49:01] <dan_j> This is the code i'm using where it freezes for about 1 second. $('#widget_apartments').animate({opacity:0,marginTop:"-30"},500)
[07:23:39] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I have a problem with cross-browser compatibility, Chrome does sometimes ignore the clicking on a custom context-like div that pops up as the context menu for some elements, but the code for the clicking is really straightforward (http://ideone.com/bAUysS) is it somehow wrong? can I show you a live-example? Can't replicate it in jsfiddle for some reason..
[07:25:35] <ZeuZ> Actually, it only works as expected on Firefox and Opera, where every click gets logged into  console, but not on IE and CHrome seems to have problems and only sometimes gets to that point
[07:33:04] <Xentil> ZeuZ: show me it in action, give me link to working site
[07:33:31] <ZeuZ> Xentil, http://190.226.242.37/NVR/Diseno3.php --> still no domain, sorry
[07:33:49] <ZeuZ> right clicking the img's div or img will pop "the context menu"
[07:34:05] <ZeuZ> and upon clicking any of the menu's ordered list, it should write in the console
[07:34:18] <ZeuZ> but somehow in chrome/IE it doesn't
[07:34:21] <ZeuZ> (not always)
[07:35:47] <Xentil> ok, i will check
[07:39:46] <wa5ted> im in such a good mood today :D
[07:41:46] <ZeuZ> wa5ted, enough like not to kill me for my ugly code? :P
[07:42:01] <Xentil> ZeuZ: for me it displays console log message in Chromium Browser
[07:42:14] <ZeuZ> every time you click?
[07:42:40] <ZeuZ> Meaning, everytime you popup the message with right-click and click some of the menu items?
[07:42:56] <Xentil> ZeuZ: yes
[07:43:09] <ZeuZ> Xentil, might as well be a problem with my browser then
[07:43:51] <Xentil> ZeuZ: i have a Chromium Browser under Linux Mint
[07:44:06] <ZeuZ> Xentil, thanks for trying it out then, do you have any suggestions about the JS code? I'm all in for making it better
[07:44:24] <ZeuZ> Xentil, here it fails under Windows Google CHrome
[07:46:30] <ZeuZ> Xentil, also just tried in my gentoo box, with chromium and google-chrome-bin, both fail
[07:50:01] <Xentil> ZeuZ: i don't have any suggestions for now
[08:03:06] <sigdk> hello, any idea why "foo is not defined" here: https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/4/  ?
[08:03:14] <sigdk> you 've to click on the green icon and then on the right radio button
[08:03:19] <sigdk> to see the error at console
[08:21:20] <Xentil> sigdk: i am analyzing it but i don't know why the foo() is not defined ;)
[08:27:20] <Xentil> sigdk: Ok, i found the solution
[08:29:11] <Xentil> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/6/
[08:30:27] <sigdk> Xentil, why calling the function doesn't work ?
[08:30:47] <Xentil> sigdk: maybe it is because it was defined in other frame
[08:32:48] <sigdk> I've another question... basically my main one. The undefined foo works more or less at my original code (I don't know why not at jsfiddle)
[08:33:20] <Xentil> i think it is because it is definded in other frame than it is called
[08:33:48] <sigdk> currently, if the datatable row is expanded, I just close it. If closed, I do an ajax request and fetch some data from the backend
[08:33:58] <sigdk> and pass them to getHTMLForExpandedRow where I render them
[08:34:12] <Xentil> sigdk: maybe it is only some jsfiddle behaviour
[08:34:21] <sigdk> whenever the user clicks on the radio button, I want to refresh the whole thing
[08:34:56] <sigdk> how do I call some sort of "refresh this line" within foo() ?
[08:36:10] <Xentil> sigdk: ok, i will try to invent how
[08:41:55] <sigdk> Xentil, what I can do is expect from the user to click on the green icon so it goes up and down and refreshes itself
[08:42:05] <sigdk> but this is not handy
[08:56:50] <ZeuZ> How can I do to load a jpg image into an ajax request? I'm currently doing it with a GET request and changing attr src
[08:57:07] <Xentil> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/8/
[08:57:08] <ZeuZ> is there any way to fetch the image as a text response and then give that text response as the src?
[08:59:41] <Xentil> ZeuZ: maybe http://danielmclaren.com/2008/03/embedding-base64-image-data-into-a-webpage
[09:01:04] <sigdk> Xentil, this looks ok, but it will get complex in my original code. Let me see it a bit
[09:01:09] <sigdk> thanks in advance
[09:09:31] <sigdk> Xentil, what does .parent() do ? goes down to the function call stack ?
[09:10:18] <Xentil> sigdk: .parent() get parent element in html DOM tree
[09:13:24] <sigdk> Xentil, in my case getHTMLForExpandedRow() is called like this: https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/10/
[09:13:37] <sigdk> as I said before, I do an ajax request and pass some data
[09:13:47] <sigdk> how can I patch the version you sent ?
[09:16:16] <Xentil> sigdk: what does table.fnOpen() do ?
[09:16:49] <sigdk> Xentil, expands the current line of the table after you click on the icon
[09:17:40] <Xentil> sigdk: and what are the arguments for getHTMLForExpandedRow( /* data */ ) ?
[09:18:14] <sigdk> Xentil, data that I fetch from the backend after an ajax call
[09:18:21] <sigdk> whenever the line is closed and I click on icon
[09:18:24] <Xentil> sigdk: ok
[09:18:28] <sigdk> I do an ajax request and fetch some data
[09:18:31] <sigdk> then I expand them
[09:18:47] <sigdk> *display them on the expanded row
[09:19:42] <Xentil> sigdk: can you do the same in $.foobar() ?
[09:28:25] <sigdk> Xentil, foobar takes place whenever I click the radio button. I'm not sure I understood
[09:28:37] <sigdk> I'd like to do a refresh of this expanded row in there
[09:30:30] <Xentil> sigdk: and $(event.target).parent().parent().html(getHTMLForExpandedRow()) is not doing that ?
[09:33:09] <Xentil> sigdk: give me a moment...
[09:34:33] <Xentil> sigdk: look at this : https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/11/
[09:36:46] <sigdk> Xentil, how is that different from the previous one ?
[09:36:48] <sigdk> It might be my fault, not explaining properly what I want... or it might be very simple (I'm really new to javascript/jquery)
[09:36:58] <sigdk> I'll try show you in a while a new version
[09:37:19] <Xentil> sigdk: i updated $.foobar(), andded ajax request
[09:37:48] <Xentil> sigdk: and tell me what do you want to do now, what is a problem now ?
[09:39:00] <sigdk> Xentil, well, the problem is that I don't know what parameters should I pass at that point to my request
[09:39:06] <sigdk> but I think it's a matter of refactoring
[09:40:24] <Xentil> sigdk: in $.foobar() you want to refresh only one line with radio buttons ?
[09:40:37] <sigdk> yes
[09:40:47] <Xentil> sigdk: ok
[09:40:49] <sigdk> so I need to pass an identifier up to that point
[09:40:58] <sigdk> it's ok, I think I can rewrite it
[09:41:03] <sigdk> if I stuck I'll ask you
[09:41:05] <Xentil> sigdk: what identifier ?
[09:41:05] <sigdk> thanks a lot
[09:41:14] <Xentil> sigdk: ah, ok
[09:41:16] <sigdk> of the corresponding table line
[09:42:27] <hellyeah> hey
[09:43:02] <hellyeah> i try to use localstoragew what my aim is to remember all text in input box what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/21/
[09:45:41] <Xentil> hellyeah: replace $(this).text() with $(this).val()
[09:46:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:46:42] <hellyeah> but this apply just the val of last input box to all input box how can i handle that https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/22/
[09:47:00] <rfr> Happy New Year. I have a function that ends in a query call. to my server  var Cresult = $.post('NFG_COF', {  body: JSON.stringify(body)  }); return Cresult; }; Can anyone tell me how I can make the $.post wait for the response some the server so that it sends back a coherent (valid or invalid) response? The full function is here: http://pastebin.com/9nqRAexU Thanks
[09:47:21] <rfr> some=from
[09:47:28] <Xentil> hellyeah: and previous version what would do in this situation ?
[09:47:49] <hellyeah> pervious version?
[09:48:07] <Xentil> with $(this).text()
[09:48:13] <hellyeah> ah
[09:48:15] <hellyeah> nothing
[09:48:16] <Xentil> not with $(this).val()
[09:48:40] <hellyeah> this doesnt return anything
[09:49:26] <hellyeah> i just need a mechanism that remember all value for input boxes seperately
[09:49:31] <_TWG_> Anyone familiar wit mustache.js?
[09:49:37] <hellyeah> actually i knoıw the problem how can i handle it
[09:49:48] <hellyeah> _TWG_: template?
[09:49:57] <Xentil> and version with $(this).val() is not working ?
[09:50:09] <hellyeah> this is working
[09:50:17] <hellyeah> type some text and refresh the page
[09:50:23] <hellyeah> you will see what is wrong_
[09:50:39] <_TWG_> Yeah trying to figure out how to structure my template with my data.  Let me type up what my data looks like.
[09:51:03] <hellyeah> actually there must be examples on the net
[09:51:11] <hellyeah> handlebars.js seems easier
[09:51:36] <hellyeah> Xentil: i added all values to input in setItem
[09:51:40] <Xentil> hellyeah: yes
[09:51:52] <hellyeah> i should add those value to array oor something i guess
[09:52:00] <Xentil> hellyeah: i think so
[09:52:16] <hellyeah> because next value overwrite pervious value
[09:52:28] <hellyeah> the thing i dont know how can i use arr there?
[09:52:30] <Xentil> hellyeah: yes, exactly
[09:53:09] <hellyeah> do you know that?
[09:54:28] <_TWG_> Xentil: Here is what my ata looks like.  http://kopy.io/5VMvX#cazZlh4GeEp3jE.  I'm trying to figure out how to loop through all of my months.
[09:55:20] <Xentil> hellyeah: i think yes, you're right
[09:55:22] <hellyeah> hmm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-to-store-an-array-in-localstorage
[09:55:27] <sigdk> Xentil, how can I find out at which level of handler am I, when calling .parent().parent() ... I need a debug method
[09:56:43] <Xentil> sigdk: i try figure it out from inspecting html DOM elements
[09:57:36] <Xentil> sigdk: look at elements tree
[09:58:13] <Xentil> _TWG_: give me a moment
[09:58:58] <_TWG_> Not a problem
[10:00:19] <_TWG_> I think it might be as simple since I don't have a top level index for the months.
[10:00:30] <_TWG_> might not be *
[10:03:11] <wo03ie> How much of an understanding should one have of Javascript before moving on to Jquery?
[10:07:03] <hellyeah> taplar: do you have patience today for me :XD
[10:08:02] <ZeuZ> $(this).attr('src','data:image/png;base64,'+data); data is valid base64, same thing (replacing this with the selector) works fine, but not that line of code, the image never displays.. ideas?
[10:08:22] <Xentil> _TWG_: look at this : https://jsfiddle.net/a3ead7fv/1/
[10:08:48] <hellyeah> i try to use locastorage and all input box must remember its text what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/25/
[10:08:55] <Xentil> _TWG_: but i don't know why it tell me that $ is not defined
[10:09:15] <hellyeah> jquery 2.1.3
[10:09:20] <hellyeah> you should load it
[10:09:56] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/a3ead7fv/2/
[10:10:29] <hellyeah> gave undefined
[10:12:16] <_TWG_> It's not consoling anything
[10:13:18] <hellyeah> _TWG_: https://jsfiddle.net/a3ead7fv/3/
[10:14:34] <_TWG_> still nothing.
[10:14:44] <Xentil> hellyeah: exactly
[10:14:53] <hellyeah> check console
[10:15:03] <Xentil> i did forget arguments for .each()
[10:15:13] <hellyeah> ic january and february on console
[10:15:35] <_TWG_> I checked it and on my app I get nothing.
[10:16:01] <hellyeah> :xd
[10:16:02] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/a3ead7fv/4/
[10:16:08] <hellyeah> dunno about that
[10:16:13] <Xentil> _TWG_: aree you looking at Javascript console ?
[10:16:19] <hellyeah> but foreach argument is index,element
[10:16:43] <_TWG_> yes I'm looking at the only console tab in Chrome
[10:17:06] <taplar> hellyeah: what is wrong with your fiddle?
[10:17:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:17:28] <hellyeah> it just remember last input box val and apply it to all input boxes
[10:17:29] <taplar> and fwi i'm doing work stuff so i may be in and out today
[10:17:40] <hellyeah> thats fine
[10:17:53] <hellyeah> i just want all input boxes remember its value
[10:17:59] <taplar> it is.  if you change the first box and then re-run the fiddle it loads them all
[10:18:14] <hellyeah> if you type text to all input bpx
[10:18:18] <hellyeah> and refresh the page
[10:18:26] <hellyeah> it remember just thirrd box val
[10:18:45] <taplar> you realize your storing every input in the same local storage key?
[10:18:51] <Xentil> _TWG_: https://jsfiddle.net/a3ead7fv/5/
[10:18:57] <hellyeah> taplar: i know that problem
[10:19:08] <taplar> so fix it?
[10:19:09] <hellyeah> i just realized i need to use array or something
[10:19:13] <taplar> no
[10:19:18] <taplar> use different keys, :s
[10:19:23] <hellyeah> i guess you ccan use json.parse or json.stringify
[10:19:45] <Xentil> _TWG_: can you see some alerts ?
[10:19:46] <hellyeah> taplar: that input boxes will be generated dynamically
[10:19:54] <hellyeah> it could be 1000 inpput boxes
[10:20:05] <hellyeah> or 100000 input boxes
[10:20:07] <_TWG_> There is nothing showing in the console.log
[10:20:10] <hellyeah> or just 10
[10:20:11] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:20:11] <Xentil> hellyeah: use array
[10:20:28] <taplar> is their order guarenteed to be the same?
[10:20:42] <_TWG_> That's not my issue though.  I'm trying to figure out how to loop through all of the months using mustache.js
[10:20:48] <hellyeah> their oırder i dont i understand
[10:21:04] <taplar> the order in which the inputs appear on the page.  will it always be the same
[10:21:14] <hellyeah> no
[10:21:15] <taplar> or will it appear A B one time, but B A another?
[10:21:25] <hellyeah> you remember user construct group for buttons
[10:21:35] <hellyeah> droppable div will have title
[10:21:49] <taplar> if the inputs will not be in the same order every time, you can't use an array
[10:21:54] <taplar> you need something else
[10:21:55] <hellyeah> i plan to add input box when droppable div is created
[10:22:10] <hellyeah> and user type something to input box
[10:22:11] <taplar> you need in the least an identifier for what data goes with which field
[10:22:31] <taplar> position based logic is inherently brittle
[10:22:31] <hellyeah> user can create many droppable div
[10:22:48] <hellyeah> i cannot use position based logic
[10:23:01] <hellyeah> user can construct a group "droppablediv"
[10:23:04] <hellyeah> randomly
[10:23:34] <hellyeah> all i need to do is "remember all text in every input box seperately"
[10:23:43] <hellyeah> and i dont know the amount of input boxes
[10:23:56] <taplar> but to be able to restore them to were they should go, you have to know WHERE they should go
[10:23:56] <hellyeah> may be i can use something
[10:23:59] <hellyeah> else
[10:24:06] <taplar> and if all you have is position, and that can change, your fked
[10:24:15] <hellyeah> hahaha,
[10:24:17] <hellyeah> hahehaehahe
[10:24:38] <hellyeah> taplar: if you said this i probably give up fucking my mind with this for my healt
[10:24:40] <hellyeah> ahahahaha
[10:24:59] <hellyeah> hmm may be when you hit enter
[10:25:06] <hellyeah> you just save the value to input box
[10:25:10] <hellyeah> that can be possible
[10:25:17] <hellyeah> you type something and you hit enter
[10:25:24] <taplar> for now figure out a way to identify the specific elements.  if you can do that you could still use an array, but it would need to contain that identifier
[10:25:27] * taplar wanders off
[10:25:33] <hellyeah> when you hit enter text will be written to val
[10:25:50] <hellyeah> what does wanders off mean?
[10:26:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:26:36] <hellyeah> may be i can do a div for text
[10:26:45] <hellyeah> user type text and then hit the enter
[10:26:56] <hellyeah> and the text of div become the value of input box
[10:27:02] <hellyeah> does it sound logical?_
[10:28:44] <hellyeah> may be not
[10:28:47] <hellyeah> brb
[10:29:25] <rfr> Hi, Can anyone tell me how I can capture the results from this AJAX call http://pastebin.com/Sv2AheP2 ? Thanks
[10:29:58] <ZeuZ> http://ideone.com/sdSlic ---> why don't the img tags redraw with the data parameter? it's correct base64 without spaces that, upon calling the same line manually instead of from the script, happens as expected
[10:34:08] <Limarson> ZeuZ: Could it be, that $(this) is pointing to another object (anonymous function callback)? Maybe you need to use jquery.proxy to give the correct object into that function
[10:34:30] <shoky> ZeuZ: `this` is not the same inside the ajax callback as outside, it changes in function calls.  you can do  var elem = $(this)  outisde and then use elem inside.  or use the $.ajax `context` option to set "this" inside e.g. `context: this`, or use .bind(this) on the callback
[10:34:51] <ZeuZ> Limarson, shoky, ah, thanks! will try
[10:36:04] <ZeuZ> indeed, that was it
[10:36:35] <Limarson> Nice :)
[10:40:20] <ZeuZ> one more thing.. how can I syncrhonize that while one ajax request in an anonymous function hasn't ended, the next one doesn't occur?
[10:41:53] <taplar> ZeuZ: start your second ajax call in the done() of the first
[10:42:19] <Limarson> ZeuZ: You could do several things, the worst is to make the ajax call synch: true, you could also make the next ajax call inside the .done function or you use promises (jquery.when etc.)
[10:43:58] <taplar> rfr: take a look at the documentation for $.post().  it takes a success method in which you do whatever logic you want with the results returned
[10:44:14] <_TWG_> Can anyone tell me why only the UL is created in my mustache template?  https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/78dvqhL6/
[10:45:26] <rfr> taplar: But how do I capture that result? Sorry I am very new to jquery and JS.
[10:45:46] <taplar> $.post will give the result to the success callback as a parameter
[10:46:00] <taplar> _TWG_: your first {{{}}} looks like it's missing a } ?
[10:46:18] <taplar> i don't know much about mustache
[10:46:55] <ZeuZ> May I show a live example of what I'm trying to achieve? There are issues for what I can't put a testcase in jsfiddle
[10:47:02] <_TWG_> Okay so now it created the first li.  Thanks for that taplar
[10:47:36] <ZeuZ> I've still got two problems, one on('click'...) that gets executed only sometimes in chrome, and a lot of generated pending requests on the network tab..
[10:49:21] <taplar> rfr: also if your new you should give try.jquery.com and learn.jquery.com a once through for some intro information
[10:49:34] <rfr> taplar: Thanks for the replies and sorry for my ignorance but could you tell me in my case what that paramter would be? What would I put in the alert() to display it?
[10:50:07] <Limarson> ZeuZ: *Sometimes* Problems are the best... ;)
[10:50:15] <taplar> rfr: $.post(url, dataObject, function(result){ /* do something with result */ });
[10:51:11] <ZeuZ> Limarson, http://190.226.242.37/NVR/actual.php ---> it ALWAYS works on firefox, though it doesn't work on chrome all the time, nor in IE (no kiddin' :P )
[10:51:17] <taplar> the parameter 'result' can be called anything.   parameter names in js are not restricted to any set names, provided they are valid syntax and not a reserved word
[10:51:39] <ZeuZ> Limarson, might be my plugins though, Xentil told me it worked for him..
[10:51:57] <_TWG_> Okay.  So my data is being loaded by a promise.  I can't for the life of me figure out how to implement my mustache template with it.  https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/78dvqhL6/1/
[10:53:43] <Limarson> ZeuZ: What do all those GET queries do?Oo  My Console is freaking out :D
[10:54:18] <ZeuZ> Limarson, those get requests get a base64 string of a image that are behind a firewall
[10:54:30] <ZeuZ> from a serie of cameras
[10:54:53] <Limarson> ZeuZ: Yeah I got that, but every time a refresh finishes it starts again Oo
[10:55:04] <taplar> ZeuZ: uh, one thing about your script.  your doing some selectors and then doing an each on those and inside all your doing is binding an on 'click' to them.
[10:55:05] <ZeuZ> it's the idea, the cameras don't have video stream
[10:55:10] <taplar> don't do that, just bind to the selector
[10:55:26] <ZeuZ> taplar, but each one needs to pass a parameter from the correct parent
[10:55:53] <ZeuZ> Limarson, the cameras don't have a video stream, just take photos (snapshots) so in order to produce a video, I get one image after another
[10:55:53] <taplar> so?
[10:55:55] <rfr> taplar: Thank you very much. That is what I needed to get past my mental block.
[10:56:08] <ZeuZ> there's a C program on the server that keeps fetching and saving to then convert to a video stream
[10:56:12] <taplar> $(this) inside the each and $(this) inside the click handler are the same thing
[10:56:25] <ZeuZ> oh, cool!
[10:56:32] <taplar> :s
[10:56:52] <ZeuZ> I kind of get lost in that sometimes
[10:57:05] <taplar> just consider what you are acting upon
[10:57:08] <taplar> that is the 'this'
[10:57:33] <taplar> $(selector).on(...) will do the each for you
[10:58:44] <Limarson> ZeuZ: So you're trying to achieve 'somewhat'-Realtime?
[10:59:12] <ZeuZ> Limarson, something like that :P
[10:59:56] <Limarson> I don't know why, but that feels bad to me :D I'd make a global timeout every n seconds that refreshes the camera pictures - that's why "live streams" from holiday locations always refresh like every 5 seconds
[11:00:22] <Limarson> And they don't kill the browser with so much GET-Requests
[11:00:37] <ZeuZ> this cameras in particular have some code that refreshes every 900msecs
[11:00:42] <ZeuZ> tey come preinstalled with it
[11:00:46] <ZeuZ> lemme paste it somewhere
[11:01:33] <Limarson> Well then, make a window.setTimeout with a function that calls your refresh cameras every 1000ms and you're out of the reload-hell
[11:03:38] <ZeuZ> setTimeout or setInterval?
[11:04:14] <Limarson> ZeuZ: setinterval sorry
[11:04:44] <taplar> you probably want timeout
[11:04:53] <taplar> the request could possibly take over a second
[11:05:12] <taplar> in which case you'd have overlaps
[11:06:19] <Limarson> Yeah, than one picture might go backward...
[11:07:01] <ZeuZ> So it would be a setInterval and then call self from .done() of the ajax request?
[11:07:15] <taplar> no setTimeout
[11:08:08] <Limarson> I'd solve it maybe like this: create a variable which stores true/false, then make a function which has a deferred ajax calls and sets the variable back to false and an interval which checks if something is in progress
[11:08:20] <Limarson> I'm going to make some example...
[11:08:29] <ZeuZ> Much appreciated
[11:09:26] <taplar> (function loopImageLoad(){ $.ajax(...).done( setTimeout(loopImageLoad, 1000); })()
[11:09:47] <taplar> (function loopImageLoad(){ $.ajax(...).done(function(){ setTimeout(loopImageLoad, 1000); })()
[11:10:09] <taplar> blah, still missing some ), but that's the general idea
[11:10:42] <_TWG_> does anyone have a library for making quizes that they recommend?
[11:11:25] <Limarson> ZeuZ: What about something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/sym5ru9p/
[11:11:45] <Limarson> If one ajax call is still in progress, it'll skip the loop, otherwise it will refresh every second
[11:11:59] <taplar> -_-
[11:12:12] <ZeuZ> Limarson, the only problem I've got with that is that each camera should refresh individually
[11:12:27] <taplar> lol, your creating an artifical construct to keep track of if it's running or not, instead of just using the existing done logic.
[11:13:11] <Limarson> taplar: Yeah, because I thought all cameras should be refreshed in sync
[11:14:22] <ZeuZ> to make matters worse, dad didn't even purchase a decent internet connection :P
[11:15:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sym5ru9p/1/
[11:19:09] <Limarson> I'm going home now, have a nice evening everyone^^
[11:20:12] <ZeuZ> taplar, will try to implement it.. but first: eating something is a must :P
[11:20:14] <ZeuZ> thanks!
[11:27:31] <cjohnson> Is there a way to use data properties for selectors?
[11:27:43] <cjohnson> [data-foo=bar] only seems to work on the attribute
[11:27:55] <cjohnson> so if the data changes the selector won't work
[11:28:15] <taplar> you want to use a filter for that
[11:28:24] <cjohnson> ah alright, thanks
[11:28:31] <taplar> you -can- use them in selectors, but it's not really advised
[11:29:01] <cjohnson> just for my own curiousity how do you do that in selectors
[11:29:20] <taplar> $('[attribute="value"]')
[11:29:52] <taplar> if your going to do it that way, make sure to scope it down as much as possible to limit the amount of a dom scan you do
[11:30:01] <cjohnson> so $foo.data('something', 'someval');  and then $('[something=someval]') ?
[11:30:05] <shoky> that won't work for data properties you set with .data()
[11:30:13] <cjohnson> right that's what I'm asking about
[11:30:16] <taplar> ah, that's true
[11:30:20] <taplar> yeah, filter those suckers
[11:30:25] <cjohnson> alrighty
[11:30:31] <shoky> but you can do it via some extension, e.g. https://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/   but that's really gross
[11:30:33] <shoky> just use filter ;)
[11:30:37] <cjohnson> yeah not worth it
[11:31:00] <cjohnson> I already had a collection of maybe 5 elements and I just wanted to .is('[data-foo=bar]') it
[11:31:05] <cjohnson> filter works tho
[11:31:17] <cjohnson> or maybe not .is but whatever
[11:31:35] <shoky> you can also .get().some() ;p
[11:32:23] <shoky> er, no pun intended
[11:32:26] <cjohnson> oooh nice
[11:32:30] <cjohnson> lol
[11:32:45] <taplar> oh no, i'm unfamiliar with some() thing
[11:32:57] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[11:33:21] <taplar> interesting
[11:33:35] <cjohnson> es6 right?
[11:33:46] <cjohnson> I love all the new array methods
[11:33:58] <cjohnson> oh wow 5.1
[11:33:59] <shoky> es5 i believe
[11:34:02] <cjohnson> never even knew
[12:06:42] <harry_> I'm trying to de-select a form select, this empties the list correctly: $("[id$='MyDiv']").empty();
[12:06:53] <harry_> but this one de-select
[12:06:54] <harry_> $("[id$='MyDiv']").prop("selected", false);
[12:07:05] <duch_kazatel> you mean a dropdown?
[12:07:06] <harry_> *won;t
[12:07:11] <harry_> dp-down yes
[12:07:14] <duch_kazatel> and that's a terrible selector btw.
[12:07:26] <duch_kazatel> just use a class.
[12:07:27] <harry_> MyDiv?
[12:07:33] <duch_kazatel> [id$='MyDiv']
[12:07:45] <harry_> just to demonstrate I used MyDiv
[12:07:54] <harry_> I'm not actually using that :)
[12:08:17] <duch_kazatel> kind of strange to use the endswith for demonstrative purposes, but ok.  i also assume you're not actually targeting a div, right?
[12:08:53] <harry_> no it's an id of a select, sorry that was a stupid example i posted
[12:09:01] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:09:09] <harry_> tired and drained
[12:09:13] <duch_kazatel> this is why fiddles are cool.  anyway, you should be able to use .val('')  iirc.
[12:09:41] * taplar considers making a harry potter joke, but is too lazy

[12:10:01] <harry_> you the man! that works :)
[12:10:03] <harry_> TY!
[12:10:04] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:13:45] <zoe_infp> Hi! I need to know why it doesn't work https://github.com/Zoeinfp/generateur-de-formulaire.git
[12:14:23] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:14:40] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:14:58] <duch_kazatel> zoe_infp why what doesn't work?
[12:15:18] <zoe_infp> this http://celisoft.com/dev/zoe/generator/
[12:15:30] <duch_kazatel> what should happen that isn't?
[12:15:35] <duch_kazatel> you're not giving me anything to work with here.
[12:16:51] <zoe_infp> It supposed to make a text area appear
[12:17:13] <duch_kazatel>  $('hr').after('<div id= ?
[12:17:41] <duch_kazatel> you realize that there's no hr element on the page, yeah?"
[12:18:27] <zoe_infp> Thanks
[12:18:34] <zoe_infp> That's a good point
[12:18:48] <duch_kazatel> also: there's a lot of replicated code in here and potential for duplicated IDs.
[12:18:48] <zoe_infp> I did follow a video lesson
[12:19:09] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a good resource.
[12:19:13] <zoe_infp> Yes I can figure it
[12:19:18] <zoe_infp> ok thank you
[12:50:24] <waxoff> Is there another alternative to if() in jquery? like I want to do if(window.width < 960){ do something} without having to use if
[12:50:49] <taplar> hate if?
[12:50:51] <duch_kazatel> nope.  jquery is a dom abstraction library.  it doesn't replace basics to the language.
[12:51:04] <duch_kazatel> but you shouldn't be using ifs in cases like that anyway.
[12:51:20] <waxoff> No, it's just using javascript waits until the dom is loaded vs using jquery :(
[12:51:30] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:51:37] <duch_kazatel> jquery still has to wait.
[12:51:46] <duch_kazatel> but it sounds like you want media queries instead.
[12:52:35] <waxoff> I was thinking about media queries but I can't change a class with css
[12:52:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:53:00] <waxoff> I'm trying to change classes to certain elements based on window size
[12:53:09] <duch_kazatel> why?
[12:53:20] <duch_kazatel> just apply the CSS you want to use instead.
[12:57:17] <arc_> media queries are used to override the css you have applied to certain elements, using the selectors you are already using
[12:57:27] <duch_kazatel> right.
[14:06:11] <cannap> yo its not possible to use import {ajax} from 'jquery' ?
[14:06:15] <cannap> will this be possible in 3.0?
[14:06:17] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[14:06:22] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:06:25] <duch_kazatel> slow your roll.
[14:06:32] <duch_kazatel> context?
[14:07:28] <cannap> me?
[14:07:32] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:07:56] <cannap> its not possible to use jquery modular like import {ajax} from 'jquery'
[14:08:06] <cannap> i can only use import $ from 'jquery'
[14:08:08] <duch_kazatel> you mean using like require?
[14:08:10] <duch_kazatel> or....?
[14:08:14] <cannap> yea
[14:08:18] <cannap> but with es6 syntax
[14:08:26] <cannap> and only the modules i need
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> since part of the draw of jquery is support for a wide array of browsers, many of which might not support ES6, i'm not sure how they're implement that.
[14:09:43] <cannap> i use with webpack
[14:09:56] <duch_kazatel> you can do custom builds of jquery if you'd like.
[14:10:12] <duch_kazatel> but jquery 3.0 likely isn't build with ground-up es6 support like that.  i could be wrong though,.
[14:10:26] <duch_kazatel> you could grab 3.0 and test that yourself.
[14:11:15] <cannap> yea
[14:11:19] <cannap> i will wait or quit jquery dont know
[14:11:23] <cannap> i tested some alternatives
[14:11:23] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[14:11:29] <cannap> but this is not like they say^^
[14:11:30] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[14:11:36] <duch_kazatel> what is not like who says?
[14:11:41] <cannap> minfied as example
[14:11:45] <cannap> stuff is more complicated
[14:11:49] <duch_kazatel> huh
[14:11:49] <duch_kazatel> ?
[14:11:53] <cannap> i mean jquery is a easy thing
[14:12:10] <duch_kazatel> it fills a niche
[14:12:19] <duch_kazatel> just so happens to be a big niche.
[14:12:29] <cannap> yea its not a big problem for my project atm
[14:12:35] <cannap> but i thinked it would be nice
[14:12:38] <cannap> when jquery was modular
[14:12:52] <duch_kazatel> jquery IS modular.
[14:12:57] <duch_kazatel> you can do custom builds if you want.
[14:13:09] <taplar> deja vew
[14:13:15] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:24:37] <persina> In terms of rendering speed which is better, an svg path or circle element?
[14:24:53] <duch_kazatel> are you seeing performance issues?
[14:25:05] <persina> duch_kazatel: yes.
[14:25:38] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[14:26:03] <persina> duch_kazatel: just plotting like 1000 points using path.  Wondering if circle elements would be faster?
[14:27:50] <duch_kazatel> i'd maybe ask in #web or ##javascript?  i'm not really sure.
[14:28:12] <persina> duch_kazatel: alright.

[15:04:57] <rrva> how do I filter out elements which have text-decoration strikethrough with a selector?
[15:05:34] <taplar> you can try a filter, but i think that only works on inline styles
[15:07:20] <shoky> .filter() and .css() should work
[15:07:47] <rrva> .css('text-decoration')
[15:07:50] <rrva> ok
[15:07:54] <rrva> will try, thanks
[15:08:32] <shoky> or .not() if you wanna filter out

[15:18:21] <taplar> doesn't seem to do anything
[15:18:38] <taplar> any specific input I should give it?
[15:18:40] <skypce> i have navigation with #anchor and normal navigation, i need add class active to they ? can you help me please
[15:19:03] <skypce> i have navigation with #anchor and normal navigation, i need add class active to current active element ? can you help me please
[15:19:15] <chingyy938> taplar no input is required
[15:19:42] <taplar> i click it, it doesn't do anything.  no console log, no network requests
[15:19:57] <chingyy938> Thanks for testing, no problem
[15:20:31] <chingyy938> Taplar would it be complicated to fix this problem? http://108.61.174.129/ just trying to make this work
[15:20:45] <chingyy938> when you click go it should list jobs
[15:20:56] <taplar> like i said, i don't know what the problem is.  I don't see anything
[15:21:24] <chingyy938> okay then
[15:22:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xwzn6t1o/
[15:24:38] <taplar> da da da, just looking around.  in your ajax call, why are you using extend to build your data object?
[15:25:38] <chingyy938> that's one i found on the internet, but my version is on the main page,  http://108.61.174.129/ the one you posted is http://108.61.174.129/test2.php but yeah
[15:25:41] <chingyy938> I give up hah
[15:26:15] <chingyy938> I don't know much about ajax jquery javascript, just trying to build things and see how it works
[15:26:39] <taplar> ok, your main page looks differently
[15:26:54] <taplar> you wouldn't really use extend there.  doesn't buy you anything
[15:27:55] <taplar> ok, main page.  i see the default submit prevented message and that's the only thing i see.  other than in the network tab it not finding the bootstrap css files
[15:29:04] <chingyy938> Yes bootstrap is loading fine, but i was trying to load jobs from indeed.com on my site, but it doesn't work. That's all really
[15:31:28] <taplar> cross site?  you may be hitting a cors restriction
[15:37:44] <taplar> i don't see in your ajaxget where your making your request
[15:38:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e21nrgtp/

[16:33:53] <ismarkup> Hello, I'm getting an error...specifically a TypeError kind of error when trying to declare this var quantity = Number(View.quantity.val()) || 0;
[16:34:08] <ismarkup> I'm getting this error TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'View.quantity.val')
[16:34:32] <ismarkup> I was wondering what am I doing wrong, thanks
[16:34:34] <duch_kazatel> are view and view.quantity defined?
[16:34:45] <duch_kazatel> and if so, is it a jquery object?
[16:35:22] <ismarkup> yes they are, var View = {quantity: null,}
[16:35:27] <ismarkup> err -,
[16:35:31] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:35:45] <ismarkup> sorry, there's some other declared
[16:35:50] <ismarkup> didn't want to paste them all
[16:36:16] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: what I want to understand is why I'm getting that error
[16:36:20] <ismarkup> if you don't mind
[16:36:34] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to use something as if it's an object.
[16:36:37] <duch_kazatel> but it's null.
[16:36:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm going to guess quantity doesn
[16:36:53] <duch_kazatel> *doesn't actually have a value.
[16:37:06] <ismarkup> well, it gets the value from an input
[16:37:35] <duch_kazatel> i can only tell you based on the information in front of me :)
[16:37:40] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're making an assumption.
[16:38:20] <ismarkup> I mean, I have an input where the user should type the quantity..
[16:38:30] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't tell me anything i need to know to help you.
[16:38:34] <duch_kazatel> your error is because you'
[16:38:41] <duch_kazatel> *you're trying to use something even though it's null.
[16:38:47] <ismarkup> no, I'm completely sure about that..hehe
[16:38:48] <duch_kazatel> can you show me the code?
[16:38:51] <ismarkup> it is me
[16:38:55] <ismarkup> yes of course
[16:39:00] <ismarkup> hold on a sex
[16:39:02] <ismarkup> err sec
[16:40:33] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: oh..it is null because when the web starts...there's no input in the field...that could be it right?
[16:40:45] <duch_kazatel> i have literally no way of knowing.
[16:40:55] <ismarkup> yup I'm doing a fiddle
[16:40:57] <ismarkup> thanks a million
[16:40:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what your code looks like, what it's doing, when, etc...
[17:16:17] <cannap> what
[17:16:25] <duch_kazatel> who
[17:16:50] <cannap> you dont have jquery.crystalball.min.js ?
[17:24:42] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: you don't mind looking at a large file right?
[17:24:50] <duch_kazatel> actually i kind of do.
[17:25:10] <duch_kazatel> standalone test cases are awesome.
[17:28:06] <robin_sz> question, generally, are newer versions of jquery backwards compatible?
[17:28:14] <duch_kazatel> wrong question :)
[17:28:29] <duch_kazatel> backwards compatible with /what/ ?
[17:28:39] <robin_sz> earlier version
[17:28:50] <duch_kazatel> largely, yes, but there are some exceptions to that.
[17:28:53] <duch_kazatel> like 1.9
[17:28:59] <robin_sz> umm ...
[17:29:00] <duch_kazatel> and 3.0 will probably break a bit, too.
[17:29:26] <duch_kazatel> things occasionally get removed/changed, so it's hard to guarantee either way./
[17:29:30] <robin_sz> errm .. this project is on 1.4.4
[17:29:36] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[17:29:46] <duch_kazatel> you're going to have a hard time updating.
[17:29:46] <robin_sz> yes, I know, shoot me
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> current latest is 1.11.3/2.1.4
[17:30:06] <duch_kazatel> you have a project in front of you :)
[17:30:08] <robin_sz> ok, I'll just leave it then, as it seems to work
[17:30:15] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:30:24] <duch_kazatel> that's actually exactly the opposite of what i'd suggest.
[17:30:32] <duch_kazatel> newer versions contain fixes for newer browsers, as well.
[17:30:41] <duch_kazatel> you'll want to update eventually.
[17:30:50] <duch_kazatel> might as well do it now before you have more incompatible code.
[17:31:10] <robin_sz> I think it highly unlikley I used anything beyons basic features and selectors
[17:31:34] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter.
[17:31:52] <robin_sz> I'll leav it for now then if its going to be a project
[17:31:52] <duch_kazatel> newer browsers can be more broken/inconsistent than you may thing.
[17:32:00] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/y4pk1wer/
[17:32:02] <duch_kazatel> it's a very worthwhile project imo, but ok.
[17:32:15] <duch_kazatel> isaacdurazo that's... a few hundred lines.
[17:32:16] <ismarkup> the function is clientInvestmentTotal()
[17:32:21] <ismarkup> the one that makes the calculation
[17:32:52] <duch_kazatel> uh
[17:32:56] <duch_kazatel> okay - how to i replicate the bug?
[17:33:32] <ismarkup> yes I just want you to look at three things..the View declaration, the function, and line 267 to 322 crazyness
[17:33:48] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[17:33:52] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:34:12] <duch_kazatel> this is really hard to understand.
[17:34:16] <ismarkup> I don't want you to spot the bug because I want your opinion on how the file is built
[17:34:20] <ismarkup> lol
[17:34:22] <ismarkup> I know :(
[17:34:27] <ismarkup> I'm sorry it is not mine..
[17:34:57] <ismarkup> basically I can't manage to declare quantity as we tried a few lines above
[17:35:00] <ismarkup> it errors
[17:35:01] <duch_kazatel> View.quantity gets redeclared like 3 tiumes.
[17:35:03] <robin_sz> duch_kazatel, all becuase I forgot to include the auto_complete widget in the custom jquery-ui min I built all those years ago
[17:35:37] <robin_sz> maybe I should just recruit a starving programmer
[17:35:45] <duch_kazatel> that's... kind of messed up, but OK.
[17:36:52] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: thanks btw..I know it is a mess, I want to rebuild it and make it more understandable
[17:37:10] <duch_kazatel> ismarkup basically, you're trying to do foo.bar = $().on('event', function() { console.log(foo.bar) });
[17:37:12] <duch_kazatel> see the issue there?
[17:37:34] <ismarkup> well, yes..it makes no sense
[17:37:36] <ismarkup> haha
[17:37:38] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:37:40] <duch_kazatel> you can't do that.
[17:38:01] <duch_kazatel> this smacks of somebody who doesn't understand $(this)
[17:38:40] <ismarkup> so, that's why the declaration that we are trying to do, fails.
[17:38:52] <ismarkup> seriously man, I do not understand that View approach
[17:38:58] <ismarkup> :(
[17:39:02] <duch_kazatel> that's not really a "view" for what it's worth.
[17:39:06] <duch_kazatel> this is painfully ad hoc.
[17:39:18] <duch_kazatel> lots of repetition.
[17:39:28] <duch_kazatel> very little abstraction
[17:39:32] <ismarkup> don't you think that stripping all this to regular variables would be better?
[17:39:39] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:39:43] <duch_kazatel> what is this trying to do?
[17:39:53] <duch_kazatel> because that's a loaded question :)
[17:40:02] <duch_kazatel> that won't actually solve any of your problems.
[17:40:11] <ismarkup> well..it monitors the DOM for changes and makes calculations according to the input on the fly
[17:40:33] <ismarkup> then on submit it writes it to a DB
[17:40:36] <duch_kazatel> then 90% of this code is unnecessary.
[17:40:42] <ismarkup> lmfao
[17:40:46] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:40:54] <duch_kazatel> it's trying too hard to be clever.
[17:41:05] <duch_kazatel> for instance, all those event bindings?
[17:41:31] <duch_kazatel> you could replace that massive chunk with a single delegated listener.
[17:41:37] <ismarkup> those View.clientPrice repeated thousand of times?
[17:41:57] <duch_kazatel> yep.  and you don't need the declarations, either.
[17:42:00] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: man, could you give me an example with...for example...clientPrice...so I can replicate it
[17:42:08] <ismarkup> if you don't mind my asking
[17:42:12] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:42:18] <duch_kazatel> not going to fix anything in that file.
[17:42:22] <duch_kazatel> i'd start over if I were you.
[17:42:30] <ismarkup> lol
[17:42:45] <ismarkup> I understand..but maybe a separate fiddle with the listener example
[17:42:57] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:43:05] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:43:07] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:43:20] <ismarkup> very fair
[17:43:22] <ismarkup> hehe
[17:43:27] <ismarkup> thanks a ton I'm going to read
[17:43:41] <duch_kazatel> if you get confused, make a fiddle that shows me what you've tried ;)
[17:43:54] <ismarkup> of course I'll do, thanks a ton
[17:47:41] <Newtonianb> I have a responsive design and at some point one class gets the display:none attribute applied to it (based on browser width). Is there a way I can "listen" for when that display:none gets triggered based on the responsive rules?
[17:48:11] <duch_kazatel> Newtonianb you can listen to the window resize, but I'd avoid that.
[17:48:14] <duch_kazatel> it's code smell.
[17:49:23] <Newtonianb> the place where I need to know when display:none triggers doesn't know the responsive logic and is in a different context
[17:49:34] <duch_kazatel> then you're kind of SOL.
[17:49:37] <Newtonianb> so I was trying to find ways to trigger without relying on the actual width
[17:49:51] <duch_kazatel> why do you need that?
[17:51:17] <arc_> seems like there should be an event for when a media query is applied
[17:51:18] <Newtonianb> hard to explain briefly, essentially dealing with an SPA where the header that needs to show the sidebar button is a completely different system than the actual content which MIGHT have a sidebar or not. the content has also different version so when to show the sidebar button varies based on the content
[17:54:39] <Newtonianb> i think i'm going to go the resize way with some buffer throttling so performance doesn't goe to sheet
[17:54:50] <duch_kazatel> store things ahead of time.
[17:54:55] <duch_kazatel> keep as much outside of the handler as possible.
[17:55:46] <Newtonianb> when the sidebar starts hiding is calculated through some calculations in CSS so I'm a bit stuck
[17:56:06] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you might need to unwind some of what you've built.
[17:56:08] <Newtonianb> so I don't know when to show the sidebar button, all I know is when the div is display none its time to show it
[17:56:29] <duch_kazatel> also: i wouldn't totally worry about this particular problem.
[17:56:41] <duch_kazatel> most people aren't going to be resizing their browser window like that during normal use.
[17:57:31] <Newtonianb> but I still have the problem if the page is loaded from a mobile / tablet, I still don't know whether to show the sidebar or not as the math conditions are css based and vary constantly
[17:57:55] <duch_kazatel> err, then you're going to need to have that information in your js regardless.
[17:57:56] <Newtonianb> *show the sidebar button
[17:58:48] <duch_kazatel> and showing the sidebar button should be controlled via css anyway.
[17:59:46] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/dqnfbkh8/1/  you mean something like this?
[17:59:59] <duch_kazatel> functioning fiddle.
[18:00:04] <duch_kazatel> and i have no idea what the html looks like.
[18:01:01] <ismarkup> duch_kazatel: ok, understood, but you thing that the event is correctly stated?
[18:01:09] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:01:18] <duch_kazatel> probably not, but i have no way of knowing without seeing your markup.
[18:01:38] <duch_kazatel> what kind of element is #quantity?
[18:01:43] <ismarkup> an input
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> then definitely not.
[18:01:57] <arc_> heh
[18:02:03] <ismarkup> of type text
[18:02:05] <ismarkup> oh
[18:02:18] <duch_kazatel> you didn't read the docs ;)
[18:02:37] <rogger_h> hello all, im seeking for a way to make preformances better , what is the best way to search $("#test") , $(".test"), $(".something").children(".x").children("#test") ?
[18:02:55] <duch_kazatel> rogger_h errr.
[18:02:57] <duch_kazatel> $('#test')
[18:03:04] <rogger_h> why
[18:03:12] <duch_kazatel> uses document.getElementByID() directly.
[18:03:15] <rogger_h> why not the drill down full path
[18:03:15] <duch_kazatel> which is stupid fast.
[18:03:37] <rogger_h> but document.getelementbyid wont use on LIVE updated content right?
[18:03:42] <duch_kazatel> sure it will.
[18:03:50] <duch_kazatel> as long as you run it after the element's been added.
[18:03:52] <rogger_h> and that means i wont get the jquery functions to the elements
[18:03:59] <duch_kazatel> uh
[18:04:05] <duch_kazatel> right, which is why you use $('#test')
[18:04:19] <duch_kazatel> it just happens to make use of document.getElementById() to find the element.
[18:04:21] <duch_kazatel> which is very fast.
[18:04:27] <rogger_h> ok
[18:05:00] <rogger_h> ok wil try thanks
[18:05:18] <duch_kazatel> ismarkup you also misunderstood my suggestion :)
[18:06:03] <unnu> okay, so i have a form, and i wanna basically say  for each input in the form, log to console the type of input
[18:06:17] <duch_kazatel> unnu okay - what do you have so far?
[18:07:33] <unnu> $('#form>input').each(function(){conosle.log($(this).attr('type'))});
[18:07:42] <duch_kazatel> usually you want .prop()
[18:07:46] <duch_kazatel> but yep, that'll do it.
[18:08:12] <unnu> hrmmm
[18:08:16] <unnu> i get an empty array object
[18:08:27] <duch_kazatel> you probably want .prop('type')
[18:09:23] <unnu> woot
[18:10:19] <duch_kazatel> that fix it?
[18:11:24] <unnu> I am still having problems building a FormData() object, passing my ajaxed form in as the constructor, so my thought was to do a $.each('input',   // psuedo    if(type = text) FormDataObject.append('id', 'val'),  if(type=file) FormDataObject.append('id', this.files[0])  etc . . .
[18:11:29] <duch_kazatel> ij
[18:11:32] <duch_kazatel> *uh
[18:11:33] <duch_kazatel> what?
[18:12:19] <duch_kazatel> you realize you can bass formdata a form element right?
[18:12:42] <unnu> instead of var formDataObject = FormData($('#myform'));    i am just doing var formDataObject = new FormData(); then appending each input to it
[18:12:52] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:12:55] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:13:08] <duch_kazatel> your first one doesn't work because FormData needs a raw DOM node, not a jquery object.
[18:13:32] <duch_kazatel> var formDataObject = FormData(document.querySelector('#myForm'));
[18:15:23] <unnu> well i will be a sombitch
[18:15:33] <unnu> duch_kazatel <3
[18:15:35] <duch_kazatel> it pays to read documentation ;)
[18:15:49] <unnu> i should have read it better
[18:16:05] <unnu> ive been pretty sick today . . . seems like i am not getting any work done when my brain is hazy
[18:16:16] <unnu> thanks so much
[18:16:18] <unnu> :)
[18:30:02] <rogger_h> duch_kazatel $("#test") wil still be fast if i have HUGEamount of html?
[18:30:10] <rogger_h> and ALOT of click events
[18:30:13] <duch_kazatel> there's only one #test, right?
[18:30:29] <duch_kazatel> you're confused about how the browser handles this :)
[18:30:45] <duch_kazatel> basically, the browser has a built-in shortcut for IDs - you'll be fine.
[18:30:56] <duch_kazatel> the selector itself will not cause problems/.
[18:34:16] <unnu> duch_kazatel, any reason why it wouldn't pick up some values but does others?  (FormData())
[18:34:30] <duch_kazatel> unnu nope.
[18:34:32] <duch_kazatel> no clue.
[18:34:36] <unnu> darn
[18:34:56] <unnu> won't pick out #first-name, but gets #address just fine
[18:35:12] <duch_kazatel> try in ##javascript ;)
[18:35:25] <unnu> will do

[18:49:22] <dopie> see if im doing it wrong because i know i am
[18:49:31] <duch_kazatel> ask a question.
[18:49:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to play guessing games.
[18:49:40] <dopie> im having a problem when the user re focuses on the input box it still adds a +1
[18:49:55] <duch_kazatel> please be specific.
[18:50:10] <duch_kazatel> "when I do x, i expect y, but i'm getting z"
[18:50:22] <dopie> was just about to do that
[18:50:24] <dopie> :)
[18:52:32] <dopie> when the user fills out the first inputbox correctly it gives a +1 than when the user focuse son the 2nd inputbox and fills i tout correctly it gives a +1 now.... if the user fills out the box again adding more text to the inputbox it automatically adds another +1 which makes it +3 ... how can i have it where if he re edits the input box adding additional text it doesnt add a +1
[18:52:38] <dopie> phew
[18:52:41] <dopie> hah
[18:53:05] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:53:08] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost.
[18:53:21] <dopie> ok.. if you fill the first input box with foo
[18:53:24] <dopie> you get a +1
[18:53:37] <duch_kazatel> ok.
[18:53:51] <dopie> if you goto another inputbox and comeback to the the one with foo and add other text to it you get another +1
[18:54:13] <duch_kazatel> you mean it increments.
[18:54:31] <duch_kazatel> you want $acceptedNamed to be the number of things that are filled in?
[18:56:21] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:58:59] <dopie> yes
[18:59:11] <duch_kazatel> .filter()
[18:59:16] <duch_kazatel> do you see why your current code breaks?
[19:02:13] <dopie> no
[19:02:18] <dopie> why does it break?
[19:02:34] <duch_kazatel> for starters, $acceptedNamed
[19:02:43] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to hold state the way you want it to.
[19:02:57] <duch_kazatel> have a freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cd06fhg4/58/
[19:04:03] <dopie> ugh
[19:04:11] <duch_kazatel> stop thinking so hard ;)
[19:05:31] <dopie> I was close
[19:05:44] <duch_kazatel> err.
[19:05:45] <duch_kazatel> lol
[19:05:51] <dopie> :)
[19:06:00] <duch_kazatel> global state is something avoid, either way.
[19:06:24] <dopie> ok... so filter im reading the docs can you dumb it down
[19:06:25] <dopie> :)
[19:06:34] <duch_kazatel> uh
[19:06:38] <duch_kazatel> what do you think it does
[19:20:23] <Jay305> Hi guys, i'm stuck on this for a long time :( http://108.61.174.129/ when you click "Go" it gives me all the data i need as xml, but i'd like to instead put that on the main page below the section.
[19:20:56] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery?
[19:21:35] <Jay305> I'd like to use jquery
[19:22:02] <duch_kazatel> so give it a shot and let us know when you get stuf :)
[19:22:06] <duch_kazatel> *stuck
[19:23:17] <Jay305> http://108.61.174.129/ ok i used preventdefault action for the form, but where does the information go when i click go?
[19:23:22] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[19:23:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:23:39] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't go anywhere.
[19:23:51] <Jay305> is it possible to put the url i get into a variable?
[19:24:02] <duch_kazatel> yes...
[19:24:12] <duch_kazatel> do you have any experience with JS/jquery?
[19:24:20] <Jay305> am i going in the right direction using preventdefault?
[19:24:27] <duch_kazatel> you'll start there, yes.
[19:24:31] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com - check this out.
[19:25:04] <Jay305> whatever lol
[19:25:07] <duch_kazatel> ?
[19:25:33] <Jay305> If you don't feel like answering me don't.
[19:25:58] <duch_kazatel> i'm trying to give you resources so you can help yourself :)
[19:26:02] <dopie> Jay305:  are you from miami?
[19:26:18] <Jay305> Resources are available all over the internet, i just cant find the right one to help me
[19:26:32] <duch_kazatel> so it sounds like you need to cover some basics.
[19:26:38] <duch_kazatel> which is why i suggested the learning center.
[19:27:04] <Jay305> dopie: how is that relevant :D
[19:27:25] <dopie> It might help you
[19:27:27] <dopie> :)
[19:27:36] <Jay305> I don't understand
[19:27:43] <dopie> well are you!@?
[19:27:51] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[19:28:33] <Jay305> I know you guys don't like helping people for free, just don't answer me, there's no need for it lol
[19:28:43] <dopie> Jay305: im a noob :)
[19:28:46] <duch_kazatel> the entire point of this channel is free help.
[19:28:56] <dopie> duch_kazatel: is le bomb :)
[19:29:00] <duch_kazatel> the point IS to teach you how to fish, so to speak.
[19:29:10] <dopie> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help , i understand filter now its like select in ruby
[19:29:24] <duch_kazatel> dopie you can give it selectors or functions - it's neat.
[19:29:46] <dopie> yeah reading the docs... i just was like wait a minute here... wth is going on and had to process the information
[19:30:34] <Jay305> Most back end devs are always unlikely to  help you than front-end devs lol
[19:30:37] <Jay305> Noticed that
[19:30:52] <dopie> jquery is front end :)
[19:31:17] <Jay305> completely front-end?
[19:31:18] <dopie> Jay305: Most developers help in their own manner as in RTFM or with examples, or with links to help you learn
[19:31:19] <Jay305> yea sure lol
[19:31:39] <dopie> Or are just rude... its pretty normal ... just accept it and go with it...
[19:31:44] <Jay305> If you tell a baby to read the dictionary he can't
[19:31:58] <duch_kazatel> but you're not a baby ;)
[19:32:02] <duch_kazatel> we can help you learn to learn.
[19:33:25] <dopie> I can try to help but I suck
[19:33:36] <Jay305> Hi, can anyone give me some clue explaining without giving me the answer on how to submit the form data to a variable without refreshing the page, thank you!
[19:33:41] <Jay305> http://108.61.174.129/ is my url
[19:33:48] <duch_kazatel> that question doesn't make sense.
[19:33:56] <dopie> Jay305: i think its Ajax request
[19:34:05] <dopie> AJAX request
[19:34:09] <duch_kazatel> but i think what you want is ajax.
[19:34:31] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you want to use ajax to submit a form and then display some results.
[19:34:40] <dopie> yes he does
[19:34:52] <duch_kazatel> (let him answer for himself ;) )
[19:35:18] <Jay305> k
[19:36:40] <dopie> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp
[19:36:50] <dopie> In short; AJAX is about loading data in the background and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.
[19:36:51] <duch_kazatel> don't use w3schools.
[19:36:59] <dopie> mdn?!
[19:37:05] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[19:37:18] <duch_kazatel> the learning center and api docs are far better resources for jquery.
[19:37:30] <duch_kazatel> use MDN for the rest of JS/CSS/HTML/etc.
[19:37:52] <dopie> and if that doesnt help join those online academies
[19:39:43] <duch_kazatel> sure, though lots of people don't want to do an entire tutorial just to answer one question.
[19:40:12] <dopie> It looks like he could need help with basics
[19:40:19] <dopie> just like I do
[19:40:31] <duch_kazatel> sure - and he may not learn the same way or may have different constraints.
[19:40:55] <dopie> I think all statements are valid in helping him figure out the right way to learn ajax
[19:41:08] <duch_kazatel> there's no need to be an endless contratian.
[19:41:42] <duch_kazatel> *contrarian.  i'm simply pointing out that, for a variety of reasons, expecting somebody do an entire online academy course to get an answer to a question can be unreasonable.
[19:42:07] <dopie> But from what it seems he would benefit from the foundational knowledge
[19:42:20] <duch_kazatel> sure, but that may not be appropriate at this moment.
[19:42:27] <duch_kazatel> pretty obvious they're in the middle of a project.
[19:42:29] <Jay305> duch_kazatel: i'll do the entire course for ajax javascript and jquery, no problem i'll figure it out one day, can you stop talking about me now, thx
[19:42:31] <dopie> yep
[19:42:43] <duch_kazatel> Jay305 we're not giving you a hard time - no offense meant.
[19:42:50] <Jay305> No problem
[19:42:52] <dopie> Yeah we really aren't :)
[19:42:56] <duch_kazatel> i'm admitting that people learn differently and sometimes you just need a nudge in the right direction.
[19:43:05] <dopie> <3
[19:45:36] <duch_kazatel> Jay305 and i'm not suggesting you actually do all that fwiw.
[19:45:49] <dopie> rofl...
[19:45:56] <dopie> he just wanted a simple answer and got paragraphs :)
[19:46:42] <Jay305> Yea i'd just like you both to stop referencing or indirectly talking about me, like i said i'll figure it out. I know your knowledge is valuable .
[19:46:52] <dopie> hahaahaha
[19:46:57] <duch_kazatel> we're not directly or indirectly talking about you.
[19:47:00] <duch_kazatel> we're being generic.
[19:47:16] <Jay305> Yea whatever free internet, say what you like..
[19:47:32] <dopie> so Jay305 are you in miami?
[19:47:39] <duch_kazatel> dopie drop it.
[19:47:58] <dopie> whaaaaaaaaa... dude has a 305 as for an area code... just curious
[19:48:18] <dopie> if he is in miami i can definitely help him find local help
[19:49:47] <z1haze> Any recommendations for an infinte scroll jquery plugin that is still being maintained?
[19:54:09] <duch_kazatel> z1haze i'd probably just roll my own at this point.
[19:54:22] <duch_kazatel> though i think most folks have pretty much abandoned infinite scroll.
[19:54:36] <z1haze> should rather paginate?
[19:54:42] <duch_kazatel> imo yeah
[19:54:55] <z1haze> am building a forum
[19:55:16] <z1haze> and for my 'all conversations' page i thought infinite scroll would be nice
[19:55:39] <duch_kazatel> there are a lot of usability issues that crop up for infinite scroll.
[19:56:00] <z1haze> oh like what
[19:56:20] <duch_kazatel> linking to specific things.
[19:56:27] <duch_kazatel> that's a huge one.
[19:56:35] <z1haze> what do you mean? the links are not right?
[19:56:58] <z1haze> well in my case every conversation has its own page/slug
[19:57:11] <z1haze> and each category if you are browsing a specific category would be paginated
[19:57:14] <duch_kazatel> imagine you want to link somebody to a particular "page" - now think of all the frontend calculation it'll take to get there.
[19:57:22] <z1haze> i just thought the general 'all conversations' list would be nice to have infinite scroll
[19:57:27] <duch_kazatel> just speaking from experience with using infinite scroll.
[19:57:41] <z1haze> it wouldnt take any in this case it would just be /conversations/this-post-is-where-we-wanna-gop
[19:57:58] <z1haze> why would you want to link anyone to a specific paginated page of a forum?
[19:58:02] <duch_kazatel> and when the user click into something and then clicks back?
[19:58:19] <duch_kazatel> just pointing out all the little things that users end up wanting.
[19:58:19] <z1haze> ah yea
[19:58:25] <z1haze> thats a good point
[19:58:30] <z1haze> theyd have to start all over
[19:58:44] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could build it so it doesn't, but it might not necessarily be worth it.
[19:58:45] <z1haze> i know discourse still uses infnite scroll
[19:58:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah, there's a way to get that interaction right.
[19:58:58] <duch_kazatel> but you have to be careful with it.
[19:59:07] <duch_kazatel> one of those "can be neat, but there are tradeoffs"
[19:59:56] <z1haze> im not sure how to get back where you said, but i just tested on a discourse forum and they have it figured out xD, clicking back takes me back to where i was in the infinite scrolll
[20:00:13] <duch_kazatel> then there you go.
[20:00:17] <duch_kazatel> feel free to take a swing.
[20:00:18] <duch_kazatel> :)
[20:00:36] <z1haze> thanks for pointing that out for me ahead of time, at least now i know what i think should be the toughest part
[20:03:45] <z1haze> can i select an element by its rel= data?
[20:04:01] <duch_kazatel> sure, but you should avoid doing so if possible.
[20:04:28] <z1haze> well i just want to test something, and my paginator is built automatically in the framework so it uses rel for the next page button
[20:04:34] <z1haze> how would it look?
[20:04:45] <duch_kazatel> you want an attribute selector.
[20:04:45] <z1haze> a[rel="next"]?
[20:04:52] <duch_kazatel> but you should avoid that as much as possible.
[20:05:03] <duch_kazatel> give them classes and bind to that class, then check the rel property in your handler.
[20:06:22] <z1haze> same issue with using something like :last to get the last link in the list because last is always next button
[20:06:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[20:07:04] <z1haze> heh
[20:07:15] <z1haze> .pagination li:last-of-type a
[20:07:28] <duch_kazatel> i really don't like overly complex selectors.
[20:07:46] <z1haze> well without creating a custom paginator i have to work with whats given
[20:08:07] <duch_kazatel> well, the current paginator doesn't do what you really want, right?
[20:33:23] <z1haze> well, sure, it paginates
[21:21:53] <One3yed> anyone know a good page slider using swipes for mobile?  this one: http://stereobit.github.io/dragend/ seems to be buggy on android webviews
[22:56:28] <hackel> In the docs for bind, it says: As of jQuery 1.4.2 duplicate event handlers can be bound to an element instead of being discarded.  How can I get it to discard duplicate event handlers, or check myself prior to adding them?
[23:51:11] <Bloomer> $.scrollTo('.section_4','+=200px', 500); what is the second and third parameters for?
