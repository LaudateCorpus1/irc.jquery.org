[00:03:49] <enerel> can form select dropdown open programatically?
[00:04:19] <enerel> when i select option from select then i want to open next select and focus
[00:04:58] <enerel> can?
[00:05:56] <bobbyhay> nope
[00:06:50] <Garfield-fr> b0nes: http://jsfiddle.net/tFwun/1/
[00:07:10] <enerel> why
[00:07:23] <enerel> then jquery sucks
[00:08:16] <bobbyhay> apparently Chrome can do it, but it's something they've done on their own and is a bit hackish
[00:08:33] <enerel> i see
[00:08:35] <bobbyhay> it's similar to how we can't simulate actual keypresses
[00:10:47] <enerel> acnowlodged
[00:20:33] <bobbyhay> the reason I know is because I tried to make a select open on hover a few days back
[00:21:11] <bobbyhay> instead I just made a css only dropdown instead. fun exercise. didn't cheat
[00:27:34] <P1RATEZ> i wonder if its possible to detect the onhover or focus and fire a click event on the select menu
[00:27:39] <P1RATEZ> to do that effect
[00:28:09] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[00:29:12] <P1RATEZ> oh me nothing really, just pondering bobbyhay's comment
[00:30:54] <sacho> the hell is a "form select dropdown"?
[00:31:03] <ravenzz> lal
[00:31:07] <ravenzz> a custom select I guess
[00:31:30] <sacho> and how do you open it?
[00:31:48] <ravenzz> on click?
[00:32:31] <P1RATEZ> probably a vertically flyout menu <div>
[00:32:36] <ravenzz> and fallback to the hover state when js is disabled
[00:32:57] <ravenzz> oh and on focus of course
[00:33:44] <bobbyhay> onclick doesn't do anything
[00:34:09] <ravenzz> anyway my policy is style selects with CSS(3) and don't give a shit about legacy browsers
[00:34:22] <ravenzz> bobbyhay that doesn't help do you have a demo?
[00:34:30] <ravenzz> /testcase?
[00:38:25] <bobbyhay> http://jsfiddle.net/juKNz/
[00:39:10] <bobbyhay> does jQuery index/something form elements? or is input[type=text] really expensive?
[00:39:25] <bobbyhay> well, relatively expensive
[00:40:08] <ravenzz> oh wait are you trying to open a select?
[00:41:40] <bobbyhay> well, that's what enerel asked
[00:44:08] <ravenzz> I joined the discussion few minutes ago
[00:44:16] <ravenzz> anyway you can't I think
[00:44:48] <ravenzz> you can select an option but you can't open the select with js
[00:46:54] <ravenzz> so you either give up or you convert it into an ul or something
[00:47:15] <ravenzz> a "dropdown menu"
[00:47:16] <bobbyhay> sorry, I'm on the web irc at work so I turned off the join/part messages
[00:47:32] <bobbyhay> yeah, that's exactly what I did :)
[00:47:43] <bobbyhay> css dropdown
[00:47:52] <ravenzz> but why would you open it with js?
[00:48:11] <bobbyhay> open what?
[00:48:21] <bobbyhay> my css dropdown?
[00:48:22] <ravenzz> the select
[00:48:56] <Cronoh> you know you need to change your design when browsers dont support the action
[00:49:02] <bobbyhay> I wanted to build a dropdown for quick options on a site with a userscript
[00:49:04] <iaj> Hi there. When I want to prevent the default operation that happens upon clicking a <a class="foo"> tag but want to change its class only, how owuld I do that?
[00:49:28] <Cronoh> iaj: preventDefault() and addClass()
[00:49:43] <bobbyhay> so I'd have to do a lot less work if I could just build the select, and do a 'click' on hover
[00:50:19] <bobbyhay> so instead I spent 30 minutes coming up with a css dropdown as a test of my skillz
[00:50:27] <bobbyhay> moderate, as they may be
[00:50:33] <iaj> Cronoh: and before .click(function (){ â€¦ }); ?
[00:51:52] <Cronoh> no , inside of it, iaj
[00:53:36] <iaj> huh?  sorry :(
[00:56:22] <Cronoh> $('#mylink').click(function() { this.preventDefault(); this.addClass('myNewClass'); });
[00:56:28] <Cronoh> something along those lines, completely untested
[00:56:57] <Cronoh> $('#mylink').click(function() { $(this).preventDefault(); $(this).addClass('myNewClass'); });
[00:56:58] <Clex> iaj: I think it's $('#mylink').click(function(e) { this.addClass('myNewClass'); e.preventDefault(); });
[00:57:13] <Cronoh> yea maybe that
[01:01:05] <bobbyhay> what's the difference between preventDefault and return false?
[01:09:25] <iaj> hm the link still goes to its destination :D
[01:09:28] <iaj> :-(
[01:11:42] <dangerousdave> Function1 is called on every page, function2 is called only on a single page. What is the best way to remove the duplication between these two functions specifically the reference to 'a.dialog'. http://pastie.org/8065641 thanks
[01:13:17] <sacho> aghast
[01:13:35] <sacho> where's the duplication?
[01:14:00] <iaj> Clex: I try $j("li.last a").click(function(e) { this.addClass('myNewClass'); e.preventDefault(); });   on http://server-84-33-2-64.static.serverclienti.com/products   whcih should be the log in on the top right
[01:14:02] <sacho> I assume the handler?
[01:14:05] <sacho> just factor it out then
[01:14:13] <iaj> But it still goes to the login page
[01:14:27] <dangerousdave> sacho: 'a,dialog'
[01:14:38] <dangerousdave> sacho
[01:15:04] <dangerousdave> sacho: if i change the attribute, it could introduce bugs
[01:15:16] <sacho> huh/
[01:15:26] <sacho> which part of that code is duplication?
[01:15:41] <dangerousdave> sacho: 'a.dialog'
[01:15:47] <sacho> dude
[01:15:51] <dangerousdave> sacho: in the code you will see it twice
[01:15:51] <sacho> that's not even a line of code
[01:16:00] <grafi> iaj have you checked if the handler is triggered at all?
[01:16:29] <sacho> dangerousdave, if you don't want it in multiple functions, then don't select in them
[01:16:32] <sacho> select in an initializer
[01:16:48] <sacho> and pass the links without a.dialog to function1, and a.dialog to function2
[01:17:28] <dangerousdave> sacho: ok, so an initialiser would just set a global veriable?
[01:18:32] <sacho> that's not what I said, but sure, whatever
[01:20:19] <dangerousdave> sacho: i am trying to understand what you said, the reason I am here is my jquery is poor.
[01:21:43] <grafi> you bind to the links
[01:22:17] <grafi> then in the handler you inspect if the clicked link is a.dialog or not, and call the functions resprectively
[01:22:28] <grafi> that way you dont have to change a.dialog in two places
[01:22:37] <iaj> grafi: I tried with $j("li.last a").click(function(e) { alert("YOYOYOYO");});  that works.
[01:23:24] <grafi> thats good
[01:23:43] <sacho> dangerousdave, you could use a global variable. Or you could pass parameters to your functions. This isn't jquery - it's just basic javascript.
[01:23:50] <dangerousdave> grafi: sacho: thanks, I will try
[01:24:17] <iaj> grafi: yeah. $j("li.last a").click(function(e) { this.addClass('myNewClass'); e.preventDefault(); })   but that doesnt work as expected :D
[01:24:26] <grafi> iaj try $(this).addClass() instead of this.addClass
[01:25:24] <iaj> agh. thansk!
[01:35:27] <progzer> Hi, I'm building a dynamic page using jQm (with local data in JSON similar to the example in the documentation). I'd like to show the loading indicator immediately after hooking into the pagebeforecreate event.
[01:35:43] <iaj> grafi: I now embedded a somehow dimming for login on my page here.. (if you click on LOGIN on the top right)... What would be the smartest way to be able to dismiss the dimmer when one clicks somewhere in the black/dimmed range?  http://server-84-33-2-64.static.serverclienti.com/
[01:36:14] <progzer> My JSON structure/code also accounts for being able to load certain data externally via ajax (to load into the dynamically generated page) - I'd also like to show the standard "loading error" dialog when my ajax receives a 404 etc.
[01:37:07] <grafi> iaj you can just do $j('.dimmer').click(function() { $(this).hide(); })
[01:40:17] <zulu-gula> var re = /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z])[0-9a-zA-Z]{6,}$/; alert(re.test("password!"); <-- this is my regular expression that chceks for password to has at least one number and letters and minimum lenght = 7
[01:40:45] <zulu-gula> I would like to update it so user could add at least one number or special char (example: !@#$^&* etc)
[01:41:43] <progzer> could or must?
[01:43:03] <progzer> Anyway, my question is essentially - how do I programmatically trigger the standard "loading" or "page load error" UI?
[01:44:00] <geoffb> I would like to include a jquery-ui menu on a page, and fill the the menu with content returned by a GET request. I have content that works well if I paste it straight into the page. struggling with the 'GET' bit. May I have some help, please.
[01:45:00] <progzer> geoffb, not sure if you're figuring out similar stuff as I was yesterday (using jquery *mobile*)
[01:45:03] <grafi> show some code geoffb
[01:45:40] <progzer> But in jQm, if you want to dynamically generate pages, you have to "let the framework know" by triggering 'create' or 'refresh'
[01:47:34] <zulu-gula> progzer, could
[01:47:48] <zulu-gula> so special chars would be the same treated as numbers
[01:48:42] <geoffb> progzer: I'm not working with mobile... want it to work in 'generic' first!
[01:48:51] <geoffb> grafi: OK, gimme a minute...
[01:48:54] <progzer> zulu, don't know if this is very "performant" (but does it really need to be?): You could just check 4 regexes - one for each - number{1,}, letters{1,}, special characters{1,}, total character{6,}
[01:50:03] <progzer> So, if(hasAtleastOneNumber, hasAtleastOneLowerOrUpperCharacter, hasAtleastOneSpecial, hasAtLeastSixCharacter) { /* accept */ } else { /* please choose a better password */ }
[01:50:42] <progzer> Oops, the commas in the if should be ANDs (&&)
[01:51:35] <progzer> Maybe we just start thinking in more complex ways when we see a pronunciation defying regex that we forget we can just have more than one.
[01:53:50] <progzer> Anyone, how can I trigger the showLoadMsg programmatically
[01:55:07] <progzer> Hmm I think this should be it (demos/widgets/loader/
[01:55:50] <geoffb> grafi, progzer: this is what I have so far... https://gist.github.com/bchgys/5829856
[01:57:03] <progzer> PS: gimme some views https://coderwall.com/p/_fkcba :)
[01:58:10] <progzer> Ah
[01:58:26] <progzer> geoff, I think your issue is related to missing that the ajax request is asynchronous.
[01:58:56] <progzer> Don't you really want to call $( "#menu" ).menu(); AFTER the data is received from the server?
[01:59:03] <grafi> geoffb well first of all you use $html in the function head and then in the replaceWith you use html
[01:59:11] <JosephFerano> hey guys, I have some basic collision detection going on where I check the x, y of both the top-left and bottom-right corners to the x, y position of an image
[01:59:12] <geoffb> progzer: ah, yes, I wondered if it might be something like that...
[01:59:18] <JosephFerano> however, when I use zoom, it messes it up, are there other ways I can try and use collision detection that will automatically adjust itself to the zoom feature, I'm getting the positions of these elements with jquery's offset function, which I think doesn't recognize a css zoom
[01:59:24] <progzer> You should add that call after the $("#dialogTeacherMenu").replaceWith(html); call
[01:59:41] <geoffb> progzer: so perhaps stick the $('#menu') call up in the ajax success call?
[01:59:48] <progzer> Yes
[02:00:35] <geoffb> grafi: gah! a newb error! well spotted!
[02:00:43] <progzer> Even though the function to replace the text shows up in the code before the code that calls .menu(), the replacing stuff actually gets called afterwards.
[02:01:28] <grafi> geoffb its the whole 'fresh set of eyes' kind of deal with those errors ;)
[02:02:11] <progzer> Not sure how experienced you already are with ajax but baise a mental flag every time you do any ajax - "this code is asynchronous, think of when I inted stuff to be called"
[02:02:12] <geoffb> grafi: very much so... it's been a long day, my eyes aren't seeing so well right now!
[02:02:26] <progzer> *raise
[02:02:29] <geoffb> grafi, progzer, between you, you've fixed it for me, thank-you. Works like a charm now!
[02:02:36] <grafi> thats always a good point to take a break ;)
[02:03:34] <geoffb> grafi: I've been at this until midnight every night this week. it's 7pm friday now (sydney.au)... I it must be getting pretty close to beer o'clock! :D
[02:03:47] <grafi> :D
[02:04:02] <geoffb> ^ s/I it/I think it/;
[02:04:13] <progzer> :D
[02:06:18] <progzer> In general, I would consider returning JSON from my server url, that way the url can serve as an api for say perhaps a native mobile client too.
[02:06:35] <progzer> (Instead of the markup for the menu)
[02:07:16] <geoffb> progzer: that's intended for me?
[02:07:48] <geoffb> ('cos if I find out now that I could have just fed JSON to the menu, imma scream! :-P)
[02:08:14] <progzer> Yes
[02:08:24] <progzer> Haha, I don't know if you can but probably.
[02:08:26] <grafi> probably maybe not ?
[02:08:35] <grafi> i mean, why would it ^^
[02:08:40] <progzer> It's not difficult to create the markup from JSON on the client side anyway.
[02:08:57] <beachandbytes> grafi, http://jsbin.com/uvojip/2/edit
[02:09:01] <geoffb> you can... $39.95 :-P http://jquery-menu.com/jquery-json-menu.html
[02:09:08] <grafi> ^^
[02:09:20] <progzer> But then again, there are some scripts/frameworks I've seen that take json (like http://listjs.com/)
[02:09:49] <grafi> maybe i should make one for $35
[02:09:53] <grafi> and get rich
[02:09:54] <grafi> :P
[02:10:09] <geoffb> make it $34.95, grafi, it sounds... better...
[02:10:30] <grafi> brrr
[02:10:47] <grafi> my shop can only handle integer values
[02:10:51] <grafi> that could be a problem :P
[02:10:58] <progzer> Haha
[02:11:27] <geoffb> and only accepts bitcoin!
[02:11:36] <progzer> I worked with a remote team once which was building a wrapper for a payment gateway and it only accepted integers when I received access to the build!
[02:11:53] <grafi> funny
[02:12:29] <grafi> beachandbytes nice that you built that for me, but I dont need it :P
[02:13:10] <beachandbytes> ya i saw i was slow :)
[02:13:21] <geoffb> beachandbytes: :-)
[02:14:15] <juria_roberts> Is there a way by which I can take screenshot of the webpage?
[02:14:22] <geoffb> I don't suppose anyone knows if it's possible to assign different width properties to the first and second levels of the menu?
[02:14:35] <grafi> juria_roberts there is
[02:14:40] <grafi> i just dont know how :)
[02:14:58] <juria_roberts> grafi: but there is way right?
[02:15:03] <grafi> jup
[02:15:12] <juria_roberts> grafi: through javascript?
[02:15:42] <geoffb> juria_roberts: I was messing about with perl, javascript and mozrepl to remote-control firefox last week. works fairly nicely. IIRC there's a mechanism for screenshotting in that.
[02:15:52] <grafi> https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/Screen-Capture juria_roberts
[02:17:00] <juria_roberts> grafi: thanks
[02:17:06] <grafi> np
[02:17:13] <geoffb> juria_roberts: this looks fairly hackful: https://github.com/bard/mozrepl/wiki/Interactor:-Screenshot-server   and  http://hyperstruct.net/2009/02/05/turning-firefox-into-a-screenshot-server-with-mozrepl/
[02:18:01] <geoffb> ok, I like grafi's approach to screenshot better. doing it with mozrepl is ... a hack! :-P
[02:18:16] <grafi> hacks are cool ^^
[02:18:49] <geoffb> grafi: oh, I it looks so cool I'll even try it some day... but I wouldn't put it into production! :-P
[02:20:28] <grafi> ^^
[02:28:59] <Auctus> i forget why I think $(document).on("click","#thing",function(){ is better than $("#thing").click( ... it was something to do with the latter being incompatible somewhere. Is that right, or do I have that backwards?
[02:29:32] <beachandbytes> if thing is added dynamically the first one will still catch the event
[02:29:46] <Auctus> Oh yeah! That was it! Thanks.
[02:29:51] <sacho> Auctus, think about how many elements you are selecting in each case.
[02:29:56] <sacho> And how many listeners you're adding.
[02:30:08] <beachandbytes> but would better if you added it to the immediate parent of #thing
[02:44:29] <themojowill> I have the following, it's pretty self explnatory. But it only works on the first time the select box is changed not after that (select box values are populated via ajax call) https://gist.github.com/mojowill/5822753

[03:18:11] <grafi> cool

[03:26:52] <deeprogram> hi ?
[03:27:02] <deeprogram> How to rebind event handler when ajax update dom ?
[03:28:28] <grafi> dont, bin to a parent element thats not replaced by ajax with $(elementNotBeingRlaced).on(event, element, function() {});
[03:29:49] <deeprogram> grafi: but
[03:30:18] <deeprogram> grafi: I don't know the handler what binded to the dom and I want to get the handler and rebind when ajax update
[03:30:34] <deeprogram> grafi: I know .live() .delegate() but I can't use it
[03:30:51] <grafi> why?
[03:31:01] <deeprogram> grafi: can I use .data("events") to get handler of event ?
[03:31:22] <deeprogram> grafi: because I don't know what looks like the handler of event
[03:32:00] <grafi> is it not your site?
[03:33:00] <deeprogram> grafi: I use drupal CMS :(
[03:33:54] <grafi> i dont know if its possible to get events the way you want, could be though
[03:35:23] <b0xa> theres plenty of doc on drupal api functionality
[03:36:12] <deeprogram> b0xa: no no no... because javascript Closures ...
[03:36:41] <deeprogram> grafi: sorry, I know how to get back the handler but because javascript closures problem, it can't work sometime
[03:37:50] <deeprogram> thanks, guy
[03:54:39] <neffe> hello
[03:56:07] <grafi> hi
[03:56:58] <neffe> grafi how are you ?
[03:57:19] <grafi> fine
[03:57:21] <grafi> :)
[04:00:02] <neffe> i have a query about jquery
[04:01:07] <beachandbytes2> select * from jquery
[04:01:55] <neffe> lol
[04:02:00] <neffe> this is not my question
[04:10:52] <neffe> sifu from uk
[04:11:10] <neffe> one of my friend is sifu
[04:38:01] <Coltaine> I made this function with jquery http://jsfiddle.net/AGPHh/ it should only be triggerd when i mouseenter a link with the class .tooltipLink but insead it always fires when I mouseover any link. what did i wrong?
[04:39:34] <sammich> $(this) doesn't even exist in that scope
[04:41:23] <sammich> well it does, but not what you think
[04:42:13] <Coltaine> $(this) should be the .tooltipLink
[04:42:26] <sammich> not in that instance
[04:43:27] <sammich> you'll be fine if you just get rid of the brackets
[04:43:46] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/AGPHh/2/
[04:46:37] <themojowill> xec_ tried your suggestion but stil doesn't fire on the second time
[04:47:48] <xec_> ?demo @ themojowill
[04:47:48] <b-ot> themojowill: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:48:50] <themojowill> xec_ not possible without db as select2 is populated by db,
[04:49:07] <themojowill> select2 is poulated by ajax call
[04:50:50] <Coltaine> sammich: i removed the brackets but now the event won't fire
[04:51:43] <xec_> themojowill: reproduce with dummy data and fake ajax? or live site?
[04:55:49] <GreatPotato> Can somebody explain to me what this means:
[04:55:50] <GreatPotato> if(!context.animation(element, html))
[04:55:57] <sammich> Coltaine: http://jsfiddle.net/AGPHh/4/
[04:55:59] <GreatPotato> If not a function?
[04:56:33] <sammich> if that function returns false*
[04:57:17] <ph88> how do i append a div with an id to body ?
[04:57:21] <Coltaine> sammich: yeah this would be the best but these .tooltipLink Links are being created after an ajax call so I can't access them like this :(
[04:57:59] <systemfault> ph88: The same way you would append a div without an id to the body
[04:58:10] <ph88> then how do i set the id ??
[04:58:18] <sammich> so...call the ajax first?
[04:58:38] <ph88> $('body').append('div[id="hai"]');  ??
[04:58:43] <systemfault> ...
[04:58:45] <sammich> $('body').append('<div id="eyedee"></div>')
[04:58:52] <sammich> or that
[04:58:57] <sammich> I should use that pattern
[04:59:01] <systemfault> sammich: ++
[04:59:06] <ph88> sorry what am i doing wrong ??
[04:59:31] <sammich> atm, we're not even sure if you're doing at all
[04:59:41] <ph88> o_O
[05:00:00] <sammich> we need an example
[05:00:04] <sammich> ?demo @ ph88
[05:00:05] <b-ot> ph88: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:00:25] <sammich> ?jsfiddle
[05:00:33] <sammich> I don't know these arcane commands
[05:01:06] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/yhZq2/
[05:01:32] <horacsio4> hello?
[05:01:40] <ph88> so i can only add elements if i put the full html ??
[05:01:46] <horacsio4> gee... I'm having issues with my connection!
[05:01:54] <systemfault> ph88: yes.
[05:01:58] <ph88> oki thx
[05:02:09] <sammich> hmm, I thought it would take systemfault's thing
[05:02:19] <sammich> oh well, I win :)
[05:02:51] <ph88> it was my assumption ..
[05:03:01] <horacsio5> tell me I have this http://ww.jsfiddle.com/qAXD8/1/ I need that umba and cumba to show vumb :)
[05:03:17] <ph88> ww. ?
[05:03:20] <ph88> haxed
[05:03:48] <GreatPotato> Ok really struggling here, here is a plugin:
[05:03:49] <GreatPotato> http://pastebin.com/YxbiRDCL
[05:03:52] <horacsio> how do I sum '.umba' and '.vumba'?
[05:03:56] <sammich> more like .com
[05:04:09] <ph88> i clicked it :|
[05:04:14] <GreatPotato> Line 313, how can i make it append instead?
[05:04:29] <sammich> yeah I did too but I have that site blocked on my router so
[05:04:43] <ph88> jsfiddle.com ?
[05:04:45] <sammich> besides, chrome would've picked it up as bad
[05:04:54] <GreatPotato>  if(!context.animation(element, html)) is always undefined?
[05:04:57] <ph88> is he a virus bot then ?
[05:04:59] <GreatPotato> Is it a bug?
[05:08:15] <Coltaine> sammich: call the ajax first doesn't make any difference. this solution works http://jsfiddle.net/Kufsd/1/ but i need to hover the links twice before the tooltip appears.
[05:08:54] <GreatPotato> Any ideas?
[05:10:21] <sammich> can you make a working example on jsfiddle?
[05:10:56] <GreatPotato> sammich: me? I can but it won't work on its own unfortunately
[05:10:57] <grafi> change it to append() ? oÃ´
[05:11:09] <GreatPotato> Yeh but this is in the core of an commerce system
[05:11:37] <grafi> so you want to change it to append but you cant?
[05:11:41] <sammich> okay, gimme a sec
[05:11:45] <grafi> but you still want to append?
[05:11:46] <GreatPotato> Basically I call .sendRequest('my_handler', { update: {'my_container':'my_partial'} })
[05:12:05] <GreatPotato> And this uses .html(), but it one instance i need to append instead
[05:12:27] <GreatPotato> It looks like i can use the animation option, but i think there is a bug
[05:12:59] <sammich> sorry, I'm not sure I can be of help here. got a link to docs?
[05:13:00] <grafi> so what exactly is the instance when you need to append?
[05:13:07] <grafi> how does it differ from the rest?
[05:13:30] <GreatPotato> I think it'd be something like this, but i think line 313 is causing the issue
[05:13:30] <GreatPotato> http://pastebin.com/cEq5HDws
[05:13:53] <GreatPotato> Im loading images from an api, only 24 per request
[05:13:59] <GreatPotato> So its a "load more" button
[05:14:16] <Coltaine> here is the jsfiddle where i can reproduce the bug: http://jsfiddle.net/Kufsd/5/ i need to hover twice over the link for the tooltip to appear.
[05:14:58] <GreatPotato> There is docs, but the animation option is undocumented
[05:15:00] <sammich> ah, I see it now :D
[05:15:06] <sammich> @ Coltaine
[05:15:15] <GreatPotato> http://lemonstand.com/docs/lemonstand_front_end_javascript_framework/
[05:15:33] <grafi> so the portion with !context.animation is from you?
[05:15:42] <sammich> the $.tooltip just builds binds the behavior to the element
[05:15:57] <sammich> so what you're doing is doing the binding on the first mouseover
[05:16:04] <GreatPotato> Nope none of it is mine
[05:16:09] <sammich> you should ideally be running the binding on load
[05:16:13] <GreatPotato> But i think thats what is causing the issue
[05:16:17] <sammich> and the mouseover isn't necessary
[05:17:07] <sammich> so that context.animation is running properly when you call it?
[05:17:25] <GreatPotato> Nope it still uses html(), not my append version instead
[05:17:48] <sammich> sorry, let me back up. What was the issue?
[05:18:10] <grafi> so its probably never actually called?
[05:18:11] <GreatPotato> Line 313, even if i overwrite the animation function like so: http://pastebin.com/cEq5HDws
[05:18:33] <GreatPotato> if(!context.animation(element, html)) is always undefined
[05:18:45] <GreatPotato> so it does line 314 instead
[05:18:47] <GreatPotato> element.html(html);
[05:19:02] <GreatPotato> So its impossible (i think) for me to append...
[05:19:04] <grafi> hm
[05:19:21] <sammich> ah sorry, long day :) so this isn't any of your code. Was it ever working or is this a new implementation?
[05:20:18] <GreatPotato> This all works fine, its been part of LemonStand for years...
[05:20:23] <grafi> seems like what you are trying to do should work though
[05:20:27] <GreatPotato> But i want to append and not overwrite
[05:22:07] <grafi> do you have a site online where i can try it myself? triggering the sendrequest thingie?
[05:23:52] <sammich> Coltaine: did you get what I said? You also said that the classes aren't present until after an ajax call. Sounds like you should be calling 'maketooltip' inside the .done() on ajax success
[05:24:34] <sammich> write the classes to the elements, then call $('.tooltipLink').tooltip({ /**/ })
[05:24:51] <GreatPotato> Not the site I'm working on but you can try http://demo.lemonstand.com/
[05:25:37] <GreatPotato> http://demo.lemonstand.com/product/mens-oxford-shoes/ <- the onclick attr on the add to cart button you can modify
[05:25:39] <sammich> whoo, non-minified
[05:27:04] <GreatPotato> Ah shit, sorry one sec
[05:27:26] <sammich> I found it
[05:27:37] <sammich> not the solution, but the line ;)
[05:29:54] <sammich> crap
[05:30:18] <sammich> duh. so !undefined is always true
[05:30:26] <GreatPotato> Think i found the issue
[05:30:37] <sammich> and I don't see why replacing append with html would cause it to fail
[05:30:45] <sammich> but I've no idea what it's overwriting
[05:30:56] <GreatPotato> When overwriting the option, element and html are both underfined
[05:31:32] <GreatPotato> http://pastebin.com/cEq5HDws
[05:31:43] <GreatPotato> element + html are not defined in the above
[05:32:53] <sammich> but on line 313, they should be defined
[05:33:09] <sammich> not sure where your new snippet is from
[05:34:41] <GreatPotato> This fixes it:
[05:34:42] <GreatPotato> http://pastebin.com/NMRrqPg3
[05:34:54] <GreatPotato> Is there a better way of doing it?
[05:35:04] <Coltaine> sammich: yes i understood. i call now the makeTooltip function from the success function from the ajax call and it works :) thank you very much
[05:38:00] <PAGO> Hello ppl. I've got a simple Buttoneffect which doesn't work. I have no idea. i used it before and everything was finde. http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Sm/
[05:38:09] <PAGO> I guess its something simple...
[05:43:59] <PAGO> nobody here`?
[05:46:10] <grafi> the fiddle is ... crap oÃ´
[05:46:10] <PAGO> hello...
[05:46:12] <xec_> PAGO: it's hard to tell from that demo what's supposed to happen
[05:46:14] <grafi> black screen?
[05:47:01] <PAGO> well it just should change the image on mousover... i simple hover effect
[05:47:01] <RRR2> What does jQuery does with $.bindReady?
[05:47:35] <xec_> PAGO: if you want images in your demo, try lorempixel.com
[05:47:39] <GreatPotato> Cheers for the help sammich
[05:48:28] <PAGO> i hoped you dont need images to see my fault :P
[05:49:14] <xec_> PAGO: well, it would be useful to see *something* other than a black screen...
[05:49:42] <xec_> i don't see anything immediately wrong with the js
[05:50:04] <xec_> but you don't even have jquery included
[05:50:28] <PAGO> i do
[05:50:39] <xec_> no, not in that demo you don't
[05:50:48] <RRR2> lel
[05:51:05] <RRR2> You're using "pure" JS
[05:51:13] <PAGO> yes I think its not neccessary to see the jquery...
[05:51:19] <RRR2> jQuery is not defined yet.
[05:51:23] <RRR2> oh nevermind
[05:52:40] <grafi> the problem is your problem is not accurately represented by the fiddle ;)
[05:52:50] <grafi> the jquery looks about right
[05:52:59] <grafi> but that doesnt really help you
[05:54:56] <RRR2> Anyway.. does anyone knows what $.bindReady, is supposed to do anyway..?
[05:54:57] <PAGO> yes^^ ok i just thought someone sees a obvious fault i can't see in my code.
[05:55:13] <grafi> not in the six lines of jquery
[05:55:32] <grafi> i would set some console.logs to the if it is called
[05:55:43] <grafi> and then work from there
[06:00:30] <sammich> lemme guess, you want to use hover to change images?
[06:00:33] <sammich> use CSS
[06:00:52] <sammich> plz, use CSS
[06:01:45] <sammich> GreatPotato: I helped? well, I'm glad you fixed it
[06:02:45] <sammich> Coltaine: no worries. that really took longer than it should for me :|
[06:03:35] <RRR2> Is it me, or you're talking alone?
[06:04:33] <sammich> I should use the nicks @ PAGO
[06:05:15] <PAGO> no i dont
[06:07:20] <sammich> well then, I'm beat
[06:07:32] <sammich> what are you trying to do then, good friend?
[06:08:27] <PAGO> I want to do what you said. But with JS :P
[06:09:00] <sammich> I'm not sure how browsers like their src tags changing
[06:10:52] <sammich> well, I don't see why your code shouldn't work
[06:11:12] <PAGO> it should i have just it before... but all of a sudden it dont xD
[06:11:34] <PAGO> but thanks for watching through it
[06:14:18] <sammich> it's working fine here
[06:15:03] <PAGO> huh? thats weird
[06:20:29] <GreatPotato> sammich: Helped enough to allow me to fix it!
[06:27:27] <xec_> sammich and GreatPotato: your nicks are making me hungry =/
[06:27:35] <GreatPotato> Mmmâ€¦. potato sammich
[06:29:45] <ExxKA> Hey Guys. How do I mimick selecting an option from a dropdown?
[06:30:14] <sammich> $('#selector').val('a valid option value')
[06:30:25] <sammich> select*
[06:30:32] <ExxKA> $("#dropDown option[value='x']").click doesnt work for me
[06:30:42] <ExxKA> Riight..
[06:30:47] <ExxKA> Thanks sammich
[06:30:51] <sammich> nw
[06:31:09] <ExxKA> hmm, nope doesnt do what I wanted
[06:31:18] <ExxKA> There is a listener on the selector which I want to trigger
[06:31:25] <ExxKA> The form changes when a certain options is selected
[06:31:31] <sammich> select* and change?
[06:31:35] <ExxKA> So I have to closer mimick a click
[06:31:43] <ExxKA> select and change?
[06:31:44] <sammich> use a change listener
[06:31:59] <ExxKA> There is already a change listener on the form, I want to trigger it
[06:32:04] <sammich> $('#select').change(function() { /* */ });
[06:32:28] <sammich> ah, sorry, you have to call change on it the selector, just $('#select').change()
[06:32:41] <sammich> right after you set the value
[06:32:50] <sammich> $('#selector').val('a valid option value').change() will do i
[06:32:51] <sammich> t
[06:33:00] <Reck> $(document).ready(function() {
[06:33:00] <Reck> 	alert('hello');
[06:33:00] <Reck> });
[06:33:09] <Reck> Shouldn't that do an alert box on page load?
[06:33:10] <sammich> hello
[06:33:20] <ExxKA> Hmm nope, doesnt work for me sammich
[06:33:23] <sammich> yes, if you have jquery loaded
[06:33:42] <RRR2> why do you need jQuery to an alert function?
[06:33:48] <RRR2> to use*
[06:34:00] <sammich> because he's using $(document)
[06:34:10] <sammich> I'm assuming that's just an example
[06:35:25] <sammich> ExxKA: http://jsfiddle.net/6VLRv/
[06:35:41] <sammich> 'one liner' ;)
[06:35:45] <RRR2> I see
[06:36:03] <ExxKA> sammich, There must be some other reason why it doesnt work on the site I am testing it on then..
[06:36:09] <ExxKA> I didn't build the selector..
[06:36:24] <RRR2> with JavaScript, the largest code in the world can be 1 line
[06:36:45] <sammich> one semi-colon, k? ;p
[06:37:37] <RRR2> semi-colon count would test how really big is a JavaScript code
[06:37:40] <RRR2> lel
[06:37:55] <sammich> not really
[06:38:11] <sammich> you could chain a heap of animations together
[06:38:18] <RRR2> Hmm
[06:38:19] <sammich> or single line handlers
[06:38:27] <RRR2> you beat me to it
[06:38:46] <sammich> ;)
[06:39:15] <sammich> ExxKA: well I can't diagnose the problem unless I see a sample
[06:39:28] <ExxKA> Fair enough :)
[06:39:46] <ExxKA> Ill see if I can figure it out myself first, I thought I was missing something obvious
[06:40:09] <sammich> the value is a string, make sure the value is an option too
[06:40:50] <sammich> okay, not a string
[06:40:56] <ExxKA> An option element, og just a valid value?
[06:40:58] <sammich> but it's safer to assume that
[06:41:08] <sammich> a value for an option inside the select
[06:41:15] <ExxKA> Right.. it is
[06:41:18] <sammich> I knew that question was coming ;)
[06:41:43] <ExxKA> I can change around values alright, and the selector changes like it should, but the form doesnt pick up the change so other fields are still marked as required
[06:41:52] <sammich> select*
[06:42:12] <ExxKA> Yes, select values
[06:45:16] <the|SonGoku> hi all
[06:45:32] <sammich> can you see the handler for that select element?
[06:45:36] <sammich> hi
[06:47:18] <the|SonGoku> ehm...sorry?
[06:47:40] <ExxKA> sammich, nope but it has a class on it, that leads me to believe it is checked by the Prototype JS library
[06:48:24] <sammich> okay, I've never used prototype
[06:48:30] <ExxKA> me neither
[06:48:39] <ExxKA> is there a way to list all observers on an element?
[06:49:03] <sammich> the change event should fire the native change
[06:50:32] <the|SonGoku> prototype in js is so awesome :) a collegue of mine explained and showed it to me and its just usefull
[06:56:19] <sammich> hmm, I'm afraid I do a lot of work in jQ, I might be tempted to use proto for a learner project
[06:58:22] <the|SonGoku> sammich: I did so too. my collegue told me to program these little chrismas tree exercise they got in the university to train proto. well, it was realy nice to learn and it also teached me a lot
[06:59:02] <horacsio> tell me I have this http://ww.jsfiddle.com/qAXD8/1/ I need that umba and cumba to show vumb
[06:59:02] <horacsio> how do I sum '.umba' and '.vumba'?
[07:00:11] <sammich> you really should copy and paste the link next time
[07:00:15] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/qAXD8/1/
[07:02:24] <the|SonGoku> horacsio: put each of the values in a variable by using var = $('.classname').text();
[07:02:38] <the|SonGoku> horacsio: after, hang them at the end of each other
[07:02:59] <sammich> huh what. Okay, now I remember what I read about using jQuery in noConflict mode if you want to use proto as well
[07:03:47] <Iszak> using two JS frameworks like prototype/jquery/dojo/mootools isn't a good idea
[07:04:05] <Iszak> three is fine though
[07:04:43] <sammich> hmm. I tend to use at least 4 on my projects
[07:05:26] <the|SonGoku> why is it ok to use three but two? :D
[07:05:39] <sammich> ...
[07:05:41] <the|SonGoku> vice versa...two but three
[07:06:06] <sammich> twas a joke
[07:08:21] <sammich> *rant* my colleagues like to capitalise the first letter of variables and identity strings
[07:08:32] <sammich> really, gets on my nerves
[07:10:44] <the|SonGoku> I understand
[07:11:22] <the|SonGoku> never do those stuff..I learned to only put only the first letter of protos in caps
[07:41:22] <RandomCouch> Is it possible to make JSON requests with phonegap and jquery? From a mobile device?
[07:42:49] <loopsdeer> Yes
[07:43:03] <RandomCouch> can I have an example
[07:43:06] <loopsdeer> same as any other browser
[08:11:23] <blib> is .md5 part of jqery?
[08:11:47] <Clex> blib: nope. Check crypto.js out.
[08:12:04] <Clex> *CryptoJS
[08:21:05] <wcwrel> how do i select all inputs with the same value?
[08:21:53] <wcwrel> i'm assuming input[value='blah'] will not work if the value was changed?
[08:24:24] <shoky> wcwrel: you can use .filter(function(){...})
[08:25:30] <wcwrel> nm .each is fine

[08:39:36] <grafi> ^^
[08:39:49] <graphettion> Fine. $('boobies').text('( . Y . )');
[08:40:06] <graphettion> $('#boobies').text('( . Y . )'); *
[08:40:16] <oste> anyone know how to get the position of the bottom of the window
[08:40:16] <jedimind> publish a plugin
[08:40:23] <oste> while taking into account the scroll as well
[08:40:43] <graphettion> Hard to beat what has been done - http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/
[08:40:48] <jedimind> scrolltop - window.height or something oste
[08:41:14] <shoky> +
[08:41:17] <jedimind> oste if youre looking to use javascript to position somethign to the bottom of the viewport...
[08:41:23] <jedimind> id suggest you use position:fixed css property instead
[08:41:26] <jedimind> and just do bottom: 0;
[08:41:52] <oste> jedimind that is an option
[08:42:07] <jedimind> thats the only way you should be doing it really, using javascript is uneccessary
[08:42:28] <grafi> jedimind appears to be correct :P
[08:42:36] <jedimind> i often am :)
[08:42:37] <oste> jedimind i wish it was that easy
[08:42:42] <jedimind> why isnt it that easy?
[08:42:50] <jedimind> footer { position: fixed; bottom: 0; }
[08:42:52] <jedimind> see, easy :)
[08:42:59] <oste> haha
[08:43:00] <grafi> otherwise its probably scrolltop + window.height
[08:43:09] <oste> for that i would visit the css channel
[08:43:16] <shoky> that's what i said ! kinda
[08:43:30] <grafi> oops
[08:43:37] <grafi> the single + escaped me :x
[08:43:40] <shoky> ;P
[08:43:43] <grafi> damn you shoky
[08:43:44] <grafi> !!!!
[08:43:48] <shoky> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh
[08:44:18] <c4ptnh00k> $(function(){if($'#boobies').text('( . Y . )')){$.extend(hands, boobies);});
[08:44:32] <oste> gaff I thought that too
[08:44:33] <oste> $(window).scrollTop() - $(window).height()
[08:44:37] <oste> != correct
[08:44:40] <grafi> so c4ptnh00k is cleary bored out of his mind
[08:44:45] <grafi> + oste
[08:44:47] <grafi> +
[08:44:59] <oste> grafi that would be a very big number
[08:45:01] <c4ptnh00k> yurp looking to do something...
[08:45:07] <grafi> well
[08:45:16] <grafi> depends on your screen i suppose?
[08:45:26] <c4ptnh00k> and how high you can count
[08:45:45] <c4ptnh00k> may run out of toes
[08:45:52] <grafi> ^^
[08:46:39] <oste> wowy
[09:01:50] <^^jfc^^> hello there, I'm working on an slider similar to this one: http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/demos/standard where I'd like to resize the main slide, to be bigger than the others. I can do it, but it is very rough, how could I achieve the resize was gradually?
[09:15:41] <chinoto> I'm trying to load flowplayer only when it's function is called, any criticism on how I'm thinking of doing it? (http://pastebin.com/0eyLb4CP). Also, is there a more specific name for the pattern I'm using than "lazy load"?
[09:16:42] <chinoto> woops, forgot to specify "this" in the apply method
[09:17:23] <chinoto> hmm... I think I'll just pass "this" :D
[09:20:20] <chinoto> How should I use apply with a jquery method? Usually I just specify null for this.
[09:27:35] <shoky> chinoto: what do you mean exactly?
[09:29:03] <chinoto> $(selector).method.apply(???,args)
[09:29:10] <chinoto> what would I put in for "???"
[09:29:41] <chinoto> I changed the lazyload function a bit: http://pastebin.com/btMUzK8g
[09:29:53] <spacebarbarian> when i return false for some reason my event handler is getting unbound (default event starts happening and my handler isnt even called) whats causing this ?
[09:30:21] <chinoto> show code?
[09:30:45] <shoky> chinoto: $.fn.method.apply( $(selector), args )   if you want $(selector) to be the context in the method call..
[09:30:57] <chinoto> spacebarbarian: you might need to use "event.preventDefault();" instead of "return false;"
[09:31:19] <chinoto> that... makes a lot more sense
[09:31:33] <spacebarbarian> chinoto, funny i just tried the same and that fixes it, so return false unbinds handlers ?
[09:31:43] <chinoto> odd
[09:32:42] <spacebarbarian> this is a custom handler by the way, Im calling it with $.trigger()
[09:32:47] <spacebarbarian> *custom event
[09:33:34] <chinoto> shoky: thanks, now I got "$.fn.flowplayer.apply($v[0],v[1]);" which is a lot easier to understand
[09:33:56] <shoky> chinoto: still not easy enough ;]
[09:34:00] <chinoto> meh
[09:34:26] <shoky> and truly i don't understand what you're trying to do there
[09:34:33] <shoky> or how you intend to use this method
[09:34:44] <shoky> but it seems.. off
[09:35:07] <chinoto> I'm using it so I can avoid loading flowplayer unless it is needed
[09:35:31] <chinoto> and the things that call this function can be dynamically loaded
[09:35:57] <shoky> wouldn't calling $.fn.flowplayer just.. call your function again?
[09:36:38] <chinoto> unless I'm wrong, it will be redefined by the script I'm pulling in.
[09:36:52] <chinoto> I looked at the script, seems right
[09:36:52] <shoky> oh
[09:37:22] <chinoto> seem good otherwise?
[09:37:40] <shoky> not really.. but i'd need to see how you're using it
[09:37:50] <chinoto> :/
[09:37:59] <shoky> why v[0] v[1]
[09:38:02] <chinoto> I'll do a jsbin and see if it works
[09:38:06] <shoky> make your code descriptive
[09:38:41] <chinoto> just because it is shorter and the function is so small that anyone who cares can take a few seconds... honestly didn't think about it
[09:38:45] <shoky> calls.push([this,[opts,callback]]);  -->   calls.push({ element: this, args: [opts,callback] })
[09:39:56] <chinoto> I was thinking about using the "arguments" keyword, but we can't ever have nice things because of IE
[09:40:12] <shoky> IE has arguments i believe
[09:40:18] <chinoto> hmm
[09:40:26] <shoky> oh or maybe i misunderstood what you mean
[09:40:26] <myosotis> maybe, but we totally can't have nice things because of IE
[09:40:31] <shoky> heh
[09:40:51] <myosotis> IE is more of a pain than those pesky clients
[09:41:32] <jedimind> IE is less and less of a concern these days
[09:41:37] <jedimind> legacy IE that is
[09:42:14] <shoky> and new IE will become more and more of a concern
[09:42:14] <chinoto> jedimind: we basically gave up on anything before IE9, we sometimes check through stuff in IE9's IE8 mode
[09:42:28] <chinoto> shoky: :(
[09:42:29] <jedimind> shoky why will new ie become a concern?
[09:42:38] <jedimind> i havent had to debug a single thing specifically in ie10 yet
[09:42:47] <chinoto> jedimind: Microsoft is always screwing something up -_-
[09:42:49] <shoky> i dunno i just wanted to bash it
[09:43:09] * chinoto agrees with shoky...
[09:43:17] <jedimind> yeah, taht's the mentality, people are all "MICROSOFT SUCKS RAH RAH" but in reality ie10 is solid
[09:43:22] <shoky> but i meant.. new useful stuff will come along. that won't be usable cause of IE
[09:43:23] <jedimind> and not that we need to all start using it or anything
[09:43:38] <jedimind> lets stay positive that they're on the right track, the whole "IE sucks argument is really tiring"
[09:44:08] <chinoto> if only we had a 20 second edit window...
[09:44:20] <jedimind> lol
[09:44:30] <chinoto> the '\"'
[09:45:28] <s5fs> jedimind: ie10 has very small marketshare. folks are still pissed at msft because we're still dealing on a daily basis with their older products.
[09:46:27] <s5fs> jedimind: while I agree they are making progress, it's truly a snails pace. microsoft has enormous resources and could absolutely release a top-quality browser if they wished, but instead they have decided to ship broken products for years, effectively holding back the web. so yeah, not a fan.
[09:46:47] <jedimind> s5fs ok but they released a solid browser, granted , late
[09:46:50] <jedimind> but they cant exactly go back in time
[09:46:59] <jedimind> so all im saying is is focus on the future
[09:47:13] <jedimind> and market share of ie7,8,9 are becoming more and more insignificant compared to other browsers
[09:47:19] <jedimind> IE market share globally across all versions is like 30%
[09:47:43] <shoky> what do you propose we bash, then?
[09:47:44] <s5fs> jedimind: yes, but that's still a substantial market
[09:47:49] <jedimind> absolutely
[09:47:54] <jedimind> shoky why bash anyone? focus on good things :)
[09:47:55] <s5fs> shoky: hm, great question.
[09:47:57] <shoky> ;]
[09:48:16] <s5fs> jedimind: look, the human condition is to be unhappy with the now, haha! that's how we roll, that's what drives progress.
[09:48:25] <s5fs> there's no "good enough mousetrap"
[09:49:38] <jedimind> im just tired of the "ie sucks" argument, ive heard it for 10 years, i get it, move on
[09:49:53] <s5fs> jedimind: i'm tired of it too
[09:49:56] <jedimind> there's nothing constructive about "OMG IE SUCKS, LOL!"
[09:50:24] <s5fs> jedimind: i don't know, years of complaints and we're finally now getting a better IE. is this because of complaining or did microsoft just decide the internet was really a thing?
[09:50:36] <s5fs> constructive criticism has its place
[09:50:42] <jedimind> it sure does
[09:50:45] <jedimind> thats the point
[09:50:49] <jedimind> there's nothing constructive about "ie sucks!"
[09:50:51] <jedimind> :)
[09:51:03] <s5fs> agreed, that's more of an observation than a criticism
[09:51:09] <s5fs> ;-)
[09:51:11] <jedimind> thats all im saying, nothing more
[09:51:19] * s5fs bangs gavel
[09:51:26] <jedimind> group hug!
[09:51:28] <s5fs> okay, next!
[09:51:52] <s5fs> now i'm suped pumped about firefox os
[09:51:58] <s5fs> that's the kinda future i can get behind
[09:52:02] <jedimind> oh can we complain about how firefox sucks these days?
[09:52:03] <jedimind> :)
[09:52:19] <chinoto> I guess I can say one thing
[09:52:23] <s5fs> jedimind: only the dev tools (but they're getting better!)
[09:52:35] <shoky> i'm starting to dislike more and more things about chrome :\
[09:52:40] <chinoto> the style editor is cramped
[09:53:00] <s5fs> shoky: technically i think chrome is excellent but i worry about google in general
[09:53:07] <dalnet22> I want to click and drag along a div without changing the position of the div. To trigger this behavior, I was thinking of adding a jquery UI draggable to the div. However, I don't want the div to move... is there a way to disable the drag yet keep it enabled so it is aware that I'm holding the mouse button down and moving along the element?
[09:53:27] <shoky> yea i dont have technical complaints.. just UI stuff
[09:53:42] <chinoto> jedimind: We weren't (for the most part) being mindless idiots trolling about IE, so I don't know what you were complaining about.
[09:53:57] <jedimind> chinoto the gavel came down
[09:54:01] <s5fs> gavel!
[09:54:07] <chinoto> don't give a damn?
[09:54:13] <jedimind> why so serious
[09:54:37] <chinoto> I don't believe I am, maybe you serious limit is lower than mine
[09:54:49] <s5fs> chinoto: i can re-open the floor if you feel you have something constructive to add
[09:54:53] * s5fs hovers gavel
[09:54:56] <chinoto> eh, don't care
[09:55:05] <shoky> dalnet22: huh?
[09:55:06] * s5fs rests gavel on gavel-rest
[09:55:08] <arschmitz> s5fs: are you harassing the nice people in here :)
[09:55:11] <wo0f> what does $.now() represent? unix time?
[09:55:17] <s5fs> arschmitz: maaaybe?
[09:55:20] <eddiemonge> dalnet22: you want to drag an element without dragging it?
[09:55:45] <eddiemonge> wo0f: Return a number representing the current time
[09:55:54] <eddiemonge> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.now/
[09:56:11] <arschmitz> s5fs: lol is portland just a little less happy now that we are gone have to harass people on here :)
[09:56:47] <dalnet22> what I want is to click on an raphael JS canvas and then drag, causing it to zoom in. So in this case, I don't want it to drag but rather to do other behavior. However, the only way I can think of to set up a drag behavior no a raphael canvas is to use jquery UI draggable
[09:56:50] <eddiemonge> wo0f: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[09:57:16] <wo0f> eddiemonge: yes ive read there ;P does it represent unix time?
[09:57:24] <s5fs> arschmitz: oh man, after everyone left I spent sunday feeling like I lost my keys or something, that kinda unsettled feeling.
[09:57:30] <eddiemonge> wo0f: you read the mozilla page?
[09:57:31] <s5fs> arschmitz: i miss everyone, i had a really excellent time!
[09:57:42] <shoky> wo0f: The JavaScript date is measured in milliseconds since midnight 01 January, 1970 UTC
[09:57:55] <eddiemonge> dalnet22: you know this is the jquery channel and not the raphaeljs channel right?
[09:58:04] <arschmitz> s5fs: awesome it was a great time portland was nice
[09:58:04] <dalnet22> eddiemonge right, which is why I asked about jquery ui
[09:58:17] <arschmitz> s5fs: if you ever make it out east ill show you the "other" portland
[09:58:20] <s5fs> arschmitz: next week is nodeconf, i'm super pumped
[09:58:28] <wo0f> shoky: ah, right o- thanks for the help
[09:58:36] <s5fs> arschmitz: i'm looking forward to it!
[09:58:41] <arschmitz> s5fs: "other" meaning original and only!
[09:58:43] <s5fs> mostly the seafood tbh haha!
[09:59:04] <eddiemonge> wo0f: ...which is what it says on the mdn page
[09:59:05] <s5fs> well and you, visiting you. you and seafood, that order. and judging portland, silently judging ;)
[09:59:15] <eddiemonge> dalnet22: all you need is mouse events
[09:59:28] <arschmitz> s5fs: corey is only a little over an hour from me too
[09:59:52] <s5fs> arschmitz: oh snap, i didn't realize how close to boston you are!
[09:59:58] <arschmitz> yup
[10:00:18] <shoky> are there gonna be vids up from portland?
[10:00:19] <wo0f> p.s. eddiemonge / shoky : that would be unix time :P
[10:00:38] <arschmitz> shoky: i believe some are already on youtube
[10:01:27] <shoky> arschmitz: know where/how i can find em?
[10:01:36] <arschmitz> shoky: sadly no
[10:02:01] <shoky> dang
[10:02:01] <s5fs> shoky: i've inquired and will reply once I learn more
[10:02:11] <s5fs> I too wanna watch them, I missed a few sessions
[10:02:12] <shoky> thanks s5fs
[10:02:21] <s5fs> happy to help
[10:02:26] <arschmitz> i was told some were up same day but i cant find them
[10:03:09] <arschmitz> s5fs: well i gotta run take it easy!
[10:03:20] <arschmitz> s5fs: and be safe!
[10:04:29] <s5fs> arschmitz: take care, great seeing ya!
[10:25:19] <newtothis> sorry if the quesiton is rather elementary but is there a way to pop some n items

[10:30:28] <RRR2> Hey guys, do you know you  can"edit" JS with javascript debugger, with chrome dev tools, well, somehow I can't, I try to "edit" the js file, but it doesn't let me, how do you fix?
[10:31:57] <graphettion> RRR2: Does that relate to jQuery?
[10:32:41] <eddiemonge> RRR2: have you watched paul_irish's talk on the dev tools?
[10:32:56] <RRR2> No, did they removed it?
[10:55:43] <holymacaroons> When I change the header information and I reload the page, my javascript stops working. I'm using jquery mobile. Has anyone experienced an issue like this before?
[10:56:53] <eddiemonge> holymacaroons: what do you mean by change the header information?
[10:58:55] <holymacaroons> When I submit a form, Im changing the header with php. When the new page loads my javascript stops working.
[10:59:15] <holymacaroons> Im changing the header in php like this: header("Location: index.php?submit=1&deviceID=".$deviceID."&");
[10:59:49] <sharky93> Hello
[11:00:11] <holymacaroons> when I open my page on the first run the javascript runs perfectly. After I submit the form it stops working.
[11:01:18] <holymacaroons> Im going to put the javascript in the content section. Maybe that'll work.
[11:02:31] <sharky93> i wanted to have a look at some complex websites which use jQuery Mobile and cater well to desktop viewing.
[11:02:43] <sharky93> so far, what i could find are mobile specific versions
[11:03:03] <sharky93> i also made a post at the forum @ http://forum.jquery.com/topic/usage-in-a-full-fledged-desktop-site
[11:03:13] <sharky93> any help shall be highly appreciated
[11:03:22] <sharky93> sorry, if i'm being too anxious :)
[11:03:34] <eddiemonge> sharky93: you know what jqm is right?
[11:04:46] <jedimind> lol sharky93
[11:05:43] <sharky93> well, im aware of this  jQuery mobile framework allows you to design a single highly-branded web site or application that will work on all popular smartphone, tablet, and "desktop" platforms.
[11:06:17] <eddiemonge> jQuery Mobile: Touch-Optimized Web Framework for Smartphones & Tablets
[11:06:35] <eddiemonge> itll work on desktop but isnt optimized for it
[11:08:23] <shader> what's the best way in an event handler to select all members of a class except for the recipient?
[11:09:05] <sharky93> well, them why does the graded browser support list all popular Desktop browsers with an "A Grade"
[11:09:11] <sharky93> *then
[11:09:58] <sharky93> :s
[11:12:59] <j_wolf> question: I'm trying to implement an autocomplete. I have appendTo going to #autoMenu, but for some reason it keeps creating a span and appending to that instead: <span role="status" aria-live="polite" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">289 results are available, use up and down arrow keys to navigate.</span>
[11:14:39] <Reck> How can I create a JQuery function?
[11:16:04] <eddiemonge> sharky93: they work, they just dont look super good.
[11:16:24] <eddiemonge> Reck: like a plugin?
[11:16:37] <Reck> eddiemonge: Just like a regular function
[11:17:45] <sonotos> hi did i get i right that i have to use options when i whant to create a statefull jquery.ui widget?
[11:18:23] <sharky93> eddiemonge: ok, thank you
[11:18:42] <Reck> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/nCM3RkgA - This is not wokring
[11:18:45] <Reck> working
[11:19:03] <Reck> However, if I put the contents of the function where I call the function, it works perfectly well
[11:19:11] <RRR2_> There are no "jQuery functions", there are just functions
[11:19:25] <RRR2_> Unless you mean jQuery as a function
[11:19:28] <eddiemonge> Reck: what specifically is not working?
[11:19:36] <Reck> The function is not called
[11:20:16] <Reck> eddiemonge: Ehm... now it's working, ha ha... thank you anyway :-P
[11:20:38] <eddiemonge> Reck: you should watch http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:21:45] <j_wolf> when I'm doing an auto-complete, how can I display the results under the input box? currently it's displaying them to the left of it
[11:23:45] <holymacaroons> Does jquery mobile clear the DOM after the header is changed?
[11:24:08] <holymacaroons> Does jquery mobile clear the loaded DOM after the header is changed?
[11:24:28] <eddiemonge> holymacaroons: you are redirecting the page so jquery mobile has to get reloaded.
[11:33:54] <the|SonGoku> so, i am back
[11:39:03] <RandomCouch> Is it possible to make JSON requests with phonegap and jquery? From a mobile device?
[11:39:15] <RandomCouch> I tried it  using jquery.ajax and jquery.getJSON, didn't get any results
[11:40:37] <InphraRed> hi
[11:40:50] <Eviltwin> RandomCouch: Uh... I use plenty of apps on my phone that make AJAX requests with $.ajax
[11:40:53] <jedimind> RandomCouch cross domain policies?
[11:41:07] <RandomCouch> yes cross domain
[11:41:12] <hazardous> sending CORS header?
[11:41:21] <eddiemonge> have you tried jsonp?
[11:41:33] <RandomCouch> eddiemonge yes,  I've tried json and jsonp
[11:41:53] <RandomCouch> I thought CORS wouldn't be a problem since it's running from a mobile app
[11:41:56] <RandomCouch> and not a browser
[11:41:58] <InphraRed> I have html using &#9658  I get that character with $(this).html()  but when I try to test it, "if(string == '&#9658;') it always fails?  can someone help?
[11:42:18] <eddiemonge> RandomCouch: have you looked at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15894565/phonegap-ajax-call-fails ?
[11:42:40] <eddiemonge> InphraRed: example?
[11:43:20] <InphraRed> eddiemonge that was the examle.  <p>&#9658;</p>         var string = $(target).find('p').text();   if(string == '&#9658;') {blah}
[11:43:24] <RandomCouch> eddiemonge Thanks I'll check it out
[11:43:35] <InphraRed> the comparison always fails.
[11:44:26] <InphraRed> I'm trying to test the string to swap &#9660; characters
[11:44:31] <InphraRed> for an accordion style menu
[11:44:31] <holymacaroons> How do I keep my phonegap camera working after a form submission with jquery mobile?
[11:44:47] <Eviltwin> InphraRed: .text() !== HTML
[11:45:02] <InphraRed> Eviltwin I've tried .html() as well, the comparison always fails.
[11:45:02] <Eviltwin> InphraRed: Use the unicode sequence for that character
[11:45:44] <Eviltwin> Which should be '\u25ba'
[11:46:06] <InphraRed> Eviltwin where did you fnid taht?
[11:46:08] <InphraRed> find that
[11:46:21] <Eviltwin> I calculated it
[11:46:28] <InphraRed> how?
[11:46:34] <InphraRed> I tried using hex everything
[11:46:36] <Eviltwin> 9658 in decimal is 25ba in hexidecimal
[11:46:43] <InphraRed> but the unicode sequence you gave me works
[11:46:58] <InphraRed> 9568 is decimal... I was treating it as hex
[11:47:25] <InphraRed> Eviltwin, thanks, I'm rocking and rolling now
[11:47:51] <Eviltwin> &#9658; == &#x25ba;
[11:47:59] <Eviltwin> That's how a hex escape works in HTML
[11:48:42] <Moleboy> Hey guys, I'm working on a navigational toolbar, and what I'm trying to have happen, is when you click on an item in the toolbar, there is a drop-down menu.  slideDown() doesn't work because it makes it open up ABOVE what I want. I tried messing around with slideUp/slideToggle to no avail
[11:48:50] <Moleboy> any recommendations or advice on which direction I should o?
[11:49:48] <the|SonGoku> can you show the page and the code?
[11:49:54] <Moleboy> Sure, one moment
[11:52:40] <_ohm> I have a button that I click, it does a $.get to the server, the server responds with the file, I can display the buffer of the file with an alert box. How do I make the browser download the response automatically?
[11:54:47] <Moleboy> the|SonGoku: http://jsfiddle.net/2Vp3e/2/
[11:54:54] <Moleboy> Jsfiddle is having some weird issues with it :-/
[11:55:13] <Moleboy> the actual website is www.halachicallyyours.com to get an idea of what it's supposed to look like.
[11:55:35] <eddiemonge> _ohm: download the response automatically? what do you mean?
[11:55:37] <guzzlefry_dev> How can I detect IE8 so I can apply ugly fixes to its bugs? :P
[11:56:02] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: why dont you use pure css for the mouse over effects?
[11:56:02] <guzzlefry_dev> For whatever reason, forms won't submit when enter is pressed when the form is in a modal window.
[11:56:26] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: Oh crap. just use li:hover
[11:56:30] <Moleboy> right?
[11:56:37] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: and you probably want e.preventDefault() in that click?
[11:56:40] <Moleboy> huh, I don't know why I didn't just do that
[11:56:40] <eddiemonge> yes
[11:56:49] <_ohm> eddiemonge, I'm sending a pdf. when I click the button I would like it to save to the user's computer/whatever. Instead it's being stored in memory. I can display all the data in an alert window but I want to save it
[11:56:59] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: I'm going to be honest, I don't know what e.preventDefault() is
[11:57:08] <eddiemonge> guzzlefry_dev: is the form in the modal itself? do you have a submit button?
[11:57:39] <eddiemonge> _ohm: you need to open it as an actual link and not an ajax response
[11:57:56] <eddiemonge> _ohm: open it in a new window if you have to
[11:58:22] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:58:55] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: oh my gosh that's glorious. saves me from the href="#" fiasco @.@
[12:01:35] <guzzlefry_dev> eddiemonge: Opening in a new window would require screwing with this CMS's code :/
[12:01:50] <guzzlefry_dev> I was just going to handle key_presses on the form. :P
[12:11:42] <jeremyagost> Hey, I'm having a weird issue with jquery.post(). I'm encoding an array of 6000+ values into the data parameter but the server it only getting a max of 999 values in the array.
[12:11:56] <jeremyagost> The transmission method is JSON
[12:12:22] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a server-side issue
[12:12:29] <jeremyagost> Is there some POST size limit within jquery? The server can accept 8MB posts
[12:12:57] <Eviltwin> As long as it's the post body, I don't think so
[12:13:34] <sirecote> jeremyagost, try using dev tools and watch the network traffic, if jquery is only sending 999 then soemthing on client side
[12:13:47] <sirecote> if it sends the 6000+ but server only gets 999 then something on server
[12:14:05] <j_wolf> so I'm trying to perform an auto-complete. I have it submitting and searching correctly...but the menu is appearing to the left of the input http://paste.laravel.com/xPL
[12:15:11] <sirecote> j_wolf: you can use the position attribute to have it display elsewhere in relation to the field
[12:16:00] <nutron> $("button#treeadd").button({icons: {primary: "ui-icon-plus"}, disabled: true}); This is how I declare a button, the icon is not clickable.  What can I do to allow the icon to be included in the click?
[12:16:37] <eddiemonge> not disable it?
[12:16:46] <j_wolf> sirecote: so something to the effect of: position: my : "bottom", at: "bottom"?
[12:17:02] <nutron> eddiemonge: ahh, I enable it later.  But that's how I instantiate it.
[12:17:11] <jeremyagost> sirecote: I'm using Safari on a mac. I can see the request and response headers for each ajax hit but I don't see a payload size anywhere
[12:17:15] <eddiemonge> j_wolf: or position: relative|absolute
[12:18:43] <j_wolf> eddiemonge: position: 'relative' is still appearing to the left. Is this the same reason it's saying '289 results are available...'?
[12:20:32] <jeremyagost> ah, Chrome shows me what I need. So it's definitely sending it
[12:20:55] <eddiemonge> j_wolf: no idea without a live example?
[12:21:12] <j_wolf> eddiemonge: http://fpgabuy.cathedralcomputer.com/parts
[12:21:22] <jeremyagost> ah nuts, limitation of PHP
[12:22:19] <eddiemonge> j_wolf: that is one distracting ui element
[12:22:40] <joesavage> I'm inserting a whole bunch of stuff into the DOM via object.html(data) (of AJAX'd data) and then making the object visible so the user can see the new content, but sometimes the object seems to render just before the content has finished being added to the DOM and so things screw up a bit. Besides just adding a delay using setTimeout, how can I make sure the DOM insert is fully finished before executing the commands to display the u
[12:22:53] <j_wolf> yea...I didn't do the design..
[12:23:15] <eddiemonge> j_wolf: i dont understand the problem. whats supposed to happen?
[12:23:41] <eddiemonge> joesavage: how are you inserting/displaying?
[12:24:02] <j_wolf> eddiemonge: the form box isn't complete yet...just getting the functionality down. Basically if you type in 5ag for example, I want the auto-complete box to show up under the text input. right now it's displaying '289 results are available, use up and down arrow keys to navigate'
[12:24:06] <joesavage> eddiemonge: Inserting via ".html" and displaying via "addClass"
[12:24:30] <eddiemonge> but how
[12:24:36] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/rMptN/1/ --So here are my two issues. Even though I'm using slideToggle(), it just goes down and straight back up with one click, which is frustrating.  Also, I can't seem to get it to align with home :-/ though I assume I need to do that via CSS
[12:25:10] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: you need to pass event in the function(event) for preventdefault to work
[12:25:20] <joesavage> eddiemonge: What do you mean but how? Through the "html" and "addClass" methods in the "success" portion of an AJAX request
[12:25:31] <eddiemonge> j_wolf: i dont see the results pop up anywhere
[12:25:46] <eddiemonge> joesavage: code example. theres a million ways those things can work together
[12:26:14] <j_wolf> eddiemonge: well I guess that would be a whole separate issue. thanks anyways...5 minutes until I leave for the day anyway. I'll tackle it on Monday
[12:26:23] <spobat> how could I prevent XSS here? var entry = $('<li class="data-topic="'+topic+'">'+name+'</li>');
[12:26:36] <joesavage> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/private/ixu4gtbprqax34qzedmqlg
[12:26:59] <eddiemonge> spobat: which parts are user enterable?
[12:27:05] <spobat> name and topic
[12:28:03] <RandomCouch> grafi - It works :)
[12:28:19] <grafi> wohoo
[12:28:20] <grafi> :P
[12:28:34] <eddiemonge> spobat: what do you need the data- part for? and for the name, $("<li cl...").text(name)
[12:28:52] <RandomCouch> grafi You know what I'm talking about right? :P
[12:29:03] <RandomCouch> making cross domain requests with phonegap, works.
[12:29:18] <RandomCouch> used json, and jQuery.ajax
[12:29:20] <RandomCouch> worked perfectly
[12:29:30] <Eviltwin> spobat: .attr() and .data() may interest you
[12:29:38] <eddiemonge> joesavage: what kinds of things are in the html?
[12:29:43] <Eviltwin> .data() if you're trying to store that for jQuery purposes
[12:29:52] <Eviltwin> .attr() if it's for some other library relying on data attributes
[12:29:53] <spobat> alright
[12:29:55] <grafi> yeah i remember
[12:30:04] <RandomCouch> :D
[12:30:08] <grafi> hasnt been that long since we talked about it ^^
[12:30:10] <spobat> thank you
[12:30:33] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: stop being so super helpful
[12:30:54] <joesavage> eddiemonge: A bunch of links with divs and images and things inside them -- it all works great with a slight setTimeout delay, but I really want it to happen as soon as possible after all DOM insertion has finished
[12:30:57] <Eviltwin> I know I need to stop. I have an addiction! :'(
[12:31:26] <spobat> eddiemonge: are you sure .text will be save for XSS?
[12:32:05] <eddiemonge> spobat: yes
[12:32:09] <Eviltwin> .text(), .attr(), and .data() are all safe for XSS
[12:32:10] <spobat> ok
[12:32:22] <Eviltwin> With the exception of something silly like .attr("onclick", ...) etc
[12:32:31] <Eviltwin> Which would be adding an event listener
[12:32:34] <eddiemonge> joesavage: what if you do the addclass in an onload event? not sure that will work though
[12:33:27] <joesavage> eddiemonge: Which onload event? This is all taking place in the bigger picture of $(document).ready as it is
[12:34:05] <Eviltwin> So I get that you're AJAXing in content but what's the other object you're talking about?
[12:36:06] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: sorry to keep bothering you, but still having issues :-/ http://jsfiddle.net/rMptN/3/
[12:36:21] <eddiemonge> joesavage: something like this but im only about 20% sure that will do what you want http://pastie.org/8067449
[12:36:37] <spobat> sorry, but am I doing anything wrong here?
[12:36:37] <spobat> http://ideone.com/lvfjs4
[12:36:52] <spobat> the XSS is really shown as html here.
[12:37:00] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: you have pull-me on both the li and the a so its firing twice
[12:37:03] <spobat> I want to the see raw user input
[12:37:32] <joesavage> eddiemonge: Thanks, I'll give it a whirl now
[12:37:45] <Moleboy> eddiemonge: I feel like an idiot, thank you so much, sorry about that :X
[12:38:46] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: not sure if there's a top-level load for anything other than the window
[12:39:05] <Eviltwin> You may have to check the load for each <img> inside or something
[12:39:25] <Moleboy> eddiemonge Eviltwin ;I'm having two more issues that I've tried to work around, that I still don't quite understand.  1.) how to get my panel that I pull down to lineup with home, and 2.) how to make it on the bottom. Could I make the panel what has home, and then have IT pulldown or something?
[12:39:31] <grafi> apparently the hardest part about a "homepage" is getting content together ._.
[12:39:33] <Moleboy> :-/ y'all have been a huge help by the way
[12:39:36] <Moleboy> I'm really appreciative
[12:39:48] <Eviltwin> Moleboy: These sound like #css questions, not #jquery questions
[12:39:59] <eddiemonge> Moleboy: http://jsfiddle.net/5jqBd/
[12:40:02] <Eviltwin> Positioning is not exactly our specialty
[12:40:11] <eddiemonge> oops sorry that was for spobat
[12:40:31] <grafi> yeah change channels and let jedimind help you :P
[12:40:39] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: well it is but im in js mode today, not css
[12:40:50] <joesavage> eddiemonge: Tried a few different forms of it, but none of them worked as expected. I guess maybe I'll just have to setTimeout D:
[12:41:10] <eddiemonge> got an example site?
[12:42:12] <QQQ> What exactly does jQuery.noConflict() do when removeAll=true. I believe it defaults to false so jQuery.noConflict(false) is the same as jQuery.noConflict(). The documentation is somewhat vague and the source code to jQuery itself actually uses an internal variable named "deep." All the function is doing is copying window.jQuery to windows._jQuery and window.$ to window._$. All 3 use-cases produce the same result.
[12:42:44] <spobat> eddiemonge: thanks, it works now!
[12:42:55] <joesavage> eddiemonge: How can I open up a private chat to give you a quick link to my test server?
[12:42:57] <spobat> I changed the wrong element for testing, how naive :s
[12:43:00] <Moleboy> Eviltwin: fair enough, wasn't sure on it, thanks though =)
[12:43:13] <eddiemonge> joesavage: /msg eddiemonge yourmessage
[12:43:17] <Eviltwin> QQQ: jQuery.nofConflict() is designed to restore $ to what it was before you loaded jQuery
[12:43:52] <Eviltwin> QQQ: jQuery.noConflict() is designed to restore $ and jQuery to what they were before you loaded this particular copy of jQuery
[12:44:24] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:44:29] <Eviltwin> .noConflict(true) for that last one
[12:44:31] <QQQ> Eviltwin: okay, but what about the removeAll=true or removeAll=true. That's the part I am confused on. I get the same result in all 3 cases.
[12:44:47] <QQQ> noConflict(true), noConflict(false) and noConflict()
[12:44:50] <QQQ> produce same result with demo code
[12:45:00] <eddiemonge> QQQ: can you file an issue on the https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com page stating whats not clear to you?
[12:45:03] <QQQ> At http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:45:55] <Eviltwin> QQQ: jQuery.noConflict() === jQuery.noConflict(false)
[12:46:20] <guzzlefry_dev> Can I chain like this: $('elem').show().css('visibility', 'visible'); ?
[12:46:33] <Eviltwin> jQuery.noConflict(true) === jQuery.noConflict(false) + restoring window.jQuery to what it was before you loaded the last copy of jQuery
[12:46:34] <QQQ> Eviltwin: yes, I figured that out, but true/false appear to do same thing when I have two versions of jQuery on the page for example.
[12:46:34] <eddiemonge> guzzlefry_dev: yes
[12:47:03] <guzzlefry_dev> Thanks. Apparently IE8's forms break if you load the page with the form set to display:none :P
[12:47:17] <QQQ> I had assumed noConflict(true) would remove prior versions of jQUery on the page.
[12:47:21] <QQQ> since it's named removeAll
[12:49:55] <Eviltwin> QQQ: http://jsfiddle.net/ayYMj/
[12:50:26] <Eviltwin> QQQ: It's called removeAll because it removes all the global aliases to this jQuery from the page
[13:03:24] <QQQ> Eviltwin: ok thank you. I've figured it out. It's vague. But I got it figured out.
[13:40:03] <joshuabud> I have a pager that includes the current page in text and I'm successfully removing the class using .remove however when I click the pager the class that was previously hidden appears. How can I hide the class regardless of what page is being view via the ajax loaded content?
[13:41:34] <Eviltwin> $('<style>').text('.classIWantToHide { display: none !important; }').appendTo('head');
[13:43:38] <the|SonGoku> Eviltwin: why appendTo('head'); ? just for my understanding
[13:44:21] <Eviltwin> I like to put my CSS in the head :P
[13:44:24] <joshuabud> That didn't work :(
[13:44:59] <joshuabud> When I touch the pager whatever text was hidden by the code reappears
[13:45:18] <the|SonGoku> ahh, yes, that makes sense..well, I though about he wanted to toggle or to remove the class only so that it has had worked that way too
[13:45:41] <the|SonGoku> can you send the page you are working on?
[13:46:52] <joshuabud> jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[13:46:53] <joshuabud> jQuery(".front .pager-current").text(".front .pager-current { display:none !important;}").appendTo("head");
[13:46:54] <joshuabud> })
[13:46:59] <joshuabud> sorry
[13:47:11] <Eviltwin> joshuabud: http://jsfiddle.net/yeS7N/
[13:47:17] <joshuabud> Yeah sorry
[13:47:40] <Eviltwin> Do you see where you messed up?
[13:47:56] <joshuabud> Yeah
[13:49:27] <joshuabud> Sweet THANKS a Bunch!
[13:52:18] <the|SonGoku> this code puts the .hideme class at the end of the style code, right?
[13:52:35] <the|SonGoku> but no idea why !important is important here
[13:55:27] <shoky> it's important here http://jsfiddle.net/yeS7N/1/
[13:55:35] <Sirisian|Work> Is there a touch api in jquery?

[14:01:31] <wachpwnski> how do you pass body data with ajax? I need to pass a ?key='K3Y' type of thing as well as a body
[14:02:38] <culh> I need to show data at dom with json. It's gerenated with php, so I need to access that data from js. At the examples, they show stuff like $.getJSON( "test.js", function( json ) {...});  // how do I use it without calling test.js? Can I throw the parsed object to a hidden dom element and then collect it with jq, or is there a simpler way?
[14:05:59] <culh> nevermind.
[14:06:01] <shoky> wachpwnski: you send it with a POST request
[14:10:26] <rainabba> I have a reference to an iFrame in my document (Kendo Editor) and can manipulate the dom in it. I want to apply some css by appending a style block to the head which is going great, but the styles in the sheet seem to have no affect. That to be expected because of how I'm adding (using headElement.append() ?
[14:11:49] <shoky> rainabba: which head are you appending to?
[14:12:19] <rainabba> $(contentLive.d().window.document.head).append('<style type="css/text" id="lp_style">html body{ background-color:red; font-size:2em; }</style>');
[14:12:30] <shoky> sry phone
[14:12:51] <rainabba> Not going anywhere soon :)
[14:13:16] <rainabba> Not like you're getting paid anyway so no need to appologize.
[14:14:18] <the|SonGoku> contentLive is a jquery build in function? and .d() just the abbreviation for document?
[14:14:58] <rainabba> contentLive is my object. d() is a function that will return $(this).data('kendoEditor')
[14:15:13] <grafi> hm
[14:15:24] <rainabba> Give me a reference to the kendoEditor itself which provides access to the iFrame and its contents.
[14:15:34] <rainabba> I think I'm seeing something else going on though.
[14:17:42] <wachpwnski> shoky how?
[14:18:46] <wachpwnski> Where do i set it, I have this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/G64ff/
[14:18:55] <wachpwnski> line 7 is the body I want to send as the data
[14:19:17] <wachpwnski> key is the parameter i want to send as ?key=
[14:19:58] <grafi> you need a key for the iplist, you cant just put it in there
[14:21:23] <rainabba> Wow. Stupid mistake :)  type="css/text" instead of "text/css"

[14:35:59] <utroda> I'm having an issues showing a loader during a ajax call. It works fine but if the user sends to requests back to back to fast it messes up and doesn't hide the loader. I call a method loader before the request to show and on the ajax done() i call loader again to hide it. Inside the loader method looks like http://jsfiddle.net/4W5SF/ is there a better way to do this, that will work better.
[14:37:48] <BeryCZ> I wanna ask about jqgrid... when i use the ajax loading in jqgrid, it requests the server with GET/POST with parametrs sidx, n_level etc... the problem is, there is a parameter "page", which i use in my cms for another things... is there a way to set easily a prefix for that?

[14:56:39] <Lianzinho> guys, I need to change the HTML content of a div... how do I add a fadeIn effect for this? I mean, I'm using $selector.html(content)
[14:56:47] <shoky> wachpwnski: your curl line doesn't have the key..
[14:56:56] <wachpwnski> yah i know
[14:56:57] <wachpwnski> sorry
[14:57:13] <wachpwnski> i want the data to be just an array
[14:57:14] <boytoy> Yo, anyone know if it's possible appying Packery / Masonry / Isotope to the currently visible items at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/YkrzJ/1/ without changing the markup?
[14:57:17] <boytoy> Or maybe I gotta use jQuery to somehow rearrange the markup in realtime or something like that?
[14:57:41] <shoky> wachpwnski: then.. data: JSON.stringify(ipList)
[14:59:00] <wachpwnski> shoky: this is what I have. http://jsfiddle.net/G64ff/2/
[14:59:38] <shoky> wachpwnski: looks ok, if you really need the key as part of the url
[15:00:58] <utroda> Eviltwin: that seemed to work.
[15:01:34] <shoky> wachpwnski:  might be safer  to do:     url: api + route + '?' + $.param({key: api_key})
[15:02:27] <Lianzinho> anyone? :D
[15:02:44] <shoky> Lianzinho:  .html(content).fadeIn()  ?
[15:03:02] <Lianzinho> shoky: I tried, do not seems to work
[15:03:22] <shoky> Lianzinho:  it needs to be hidden first if you want to fade it in
[15:03:33] <shoky> Lianzinho: make a jsfiddle if you cant get it
[15:04:18] <Lianzinho> shoky: It's empty. I'm copying the HTML of another div and putting into this
[15:04:29] <shoky> Lianzinho:  empty is not hidden
[15:05:17] <Lianzinho> shoky: I know. Any other option?
[15:05:23] <shoky> Lianzinho: hide it first
[15:08:30] <wachpwnski> shoky: I keep getting, OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/ip-list?key=mykey 400 (Bad Request)
[15:08:46] <wachpwnski> api side looks like it is not getting any data
[15:09:42] <wachpwnski> and Origin http://localhost:8080 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[15:09:53] <shoky> wachpwnski: that's 2 different origins
[15:10:21] <shoky> wachpwnski: you can't ajax from a different origin without enabling CORS headers on your servers
[15:13:31] <pringlescan> I'm using jquery and bootstrapâ€¦ when I try to .popover('destroy') a popover, it disappears, but then when I create a new popover on the same element, it shows the old ones content.
[15:14:11] <pringlescan> even if I manually in the browser delete the HTML node, and do show again, it recreates the popover with the old textâ€¦ when I look at the attributes on the element, they are correct, and show the new text.
[15:16:33] <wachpwnski> shoky: serverside like the api? because that is set. :(
[15:16:59] <shoky> wachpwnski: what?
[15:17:09] <Lianzinho> shoky: hidden with opacity: 0 or display: none?
[15:17:18] <shoky> Lianzinho:  display:none
[15:17:37] <shoky> Lianzinho: you can also do opacity:0  and then use .fadeTo(..)
[15:17:45] <wachpwnski> shoky: i set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[15:17:47] <TheOmbudsman> Goofy situation with using serialize() on a form. It *used* to work fine. I've since started doing some cleanup of code, shuffling some JS code into separate linked JS files instead of having them reside in the main script. But now it's not serializing the form elements at all - it's returning a blank value. I put the relevent code back into the main script to see if that made a difference, but no. Scratching my head trying to
[15:17:48] <TheOmbudsman> puzzle out what is breaking the serialize() now.
[15:18:09] <shoky> wachpwnski:  on which server?  8000 or 8080?
[15:18:20] <wachpwnski> it also looks like no data is being posted to my api.
[15:18:28] <wachpwnski> 8080 is the site 8000 is the api
[15:18:43] <Lianzinho> shoky: that's strange... I make the css be display: none; So when aplying html(content).fadeIn() it should overwrite this css and make it appear, isn't it?
[15:18:47] <wachpwnski> i set it on 8000 (api)
[15:19:28] <shoky> wachpwnski: and still getting that access error?  odd.. it's hard for me to say anything without seeing it for myself
[15:19:47] <shoky> Lianzinho: yes, it should
[15:20:11] <wachpwnski> yah for some reason, the api is not receiving the data either when posted
[15:20:31] <shoky> wachpwnski: it makes sense that its not receiving it if the request isn't allowed to event be sent..
[15:20:37] <shoky> even*
[15:24:28] <Lianzinho> shoky: hehehe, it's not... strange. Couldn't the css being applied after the html() input? So it's prevailing?
[15:25:21] <shoky> Lianzinho: donno what you mean
[15:26:03] <shoky> wachpwnski:  maybe your server doesn't know how to respond to the CORS "preflight" request (the OPTIONS request - to check for access)
[15:26:21] <Lianzinho> shoky: diplay: none from the css with major priority than the html().fadeIn()
[15:27:17] <shoky> Lianzinho:  .fadeIn() will set inline styles on the element which have priority over anything else, unless you're using !important in your css
[15:28:37] <Lianzinho> shoky: yeah I know. Actually I guess html() and fadeIn or fadeTo are not chainable. I've just tried using opacity: 0 too... no success
[15:29:17] <shoky> Lianzinho: they are chainable
[15:29:24] <shoky> Lianzinho: make a jsfidddle/demo of your problem
[15:30:04] <shoky> Lianzinho: http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/
[15:35:47] <Lianzinho> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/1/
[15:35:58] <Lianzinho> I'm adding full tags, not just the inner
[15:36:40] <shoky> Lianzinho: you don't have a #problematic_container element
[15:37:14] <shoky> Lianzinho: err nevermind, found it :P
[15:37:40] <shoky> Lianzinho: you dont have display:none on the #problematic_container element
[15:37:50] <shoky> just on div inside it
[15:38:16] <shoky> Lianzinho: http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/2/
[15:38:25] <Lianzinho> but I want the container always showing
[15:38:39] <shoky> decide what you want hidden, and fadeIn on that
[15:38:42] <Lianzinho> imagine it is a frame... I want to substitute just the content
[15:39:09] <shoky> Lianzinho: also you're not putting any new elements inside the container
[15:39:19] <the|SonGoku> good night, see you later
[15:39:26] <shoky> Lianzinho: p === 'This is the problematic'
[15:40:24] <Lianzinho> shoky: not putting? but p wasn't there before...
[15:40:57] <shoky> Lianzinho:  p is just text, it doesn't have any elements in it except the text
[15:41:32] <Lianzinho> you mean, it's a string?
[15:41:45] <shoky> it's a string, of course, but that's not what i meant
[15:41:59] <shoky> i meant there is no new <div> in it.. just the bare text
[15:42:10] <Lianzinho> what's the difference between html() and text() ?
[15:42:23] <eni> i have a $('li').on('click', function(){alert("ASD");}); and none of the <li> elements added dynamically through JS are being excecuted when i click on them
[15:42:27] <shoky> text() strips the html.. but that's not the issue here
[15:42:29] <eni> i mean its not fired this function
[15:42:31] <eni> how come?
[15:43:00] <shoky> eni: because that only looks for li's that are there at the time you run that line
[15:43:16] <shoky> eni: you want to use event delegation, read about it.. see ?on
[15:43:17] <bot-t> eni, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:43:33] <eni> shoky, well read my line i have used .on
[15:43:42] <shoky> eni: listen to what i say
[15:43:50] <shoky> eni: .on doesnt magically mean you're doing event delegation
[15:44:01] <shoky> go read
[15:45:46] <shoky> Lianzinho:  remember,  .html() is INNER html. it doesn't include the element itself
[15:45:47] <seantimm> eni: If you read the live documentation (http://api.jquery.com/live/), you can see the correct way to implement it using on ($(document).on(events, selector, data, handler); )
[15:46:00] <Lianzinho> shoky: strange, in my code it shows the tags!
[15:46:05] <eni> shoky, thanks
[15:46:16] <eni> before it worked without delegation (during the .live era)
[15:46:23] <shoky> eni:  .live is delegation
[15:47:48] <shoky> Lianzinho:  you're talking .children().html()  meaning the inner html of #problem, meaning just that line of text, no tags.
[15:47:54] <shoky> taking*
[15:48:22] <Lianzinho> shoky: I'll try to reproduce... just a moment
[15:53:21] <Lianzinho> shoky: that's it... http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/3/
[15:54:04] <Lianzinho> but now I understand, it's kinda stringfing the inner HTML including the tags, they're not real elements, besides being rendered... is that correct?
[15:54:23] <Lianzinho> *stringfying
[15:54:39] <shoky> html is a string by definition
[15:55:35] <shoky> Lianzinho: is there something you dont understand about the fiddle? or all good now?
[15:55:52] <Lianzinho> shoky: I forgot to change the classes at the CSS
[15:55:57] <shoky> yup
[15:56:57] <Lianzinho> shoky: well, I understand the problem, but I don't know how to solve it. Did you understand that I'm trying to transfer the html from one div to another? I want to do it with a fadeIn, how could I achieve that?
[15:57:18] <Lianzinho> are there any other option than using .html() ?
[15:57:31] <shoky> just like we did before..  http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/4/
[15:57:55] <Lianzinho> but I want the container to be always showing
[15:58:13] <Lianzinho> like, the borders must stay untouched
[15:58:21] <shoky> and like i told you: decide what you want hidden, and fadeIn on that
[15:59:02] <RandomCouch> in the css, what you want hidden write display: none, and do fadeIn on it in the script
[15:59:04] <Lianzinho> it's like I showed to... I want everything inside the container but not the container itselv
[15:59:29] <RandomCouch> Lianzinho can I get a link of what you showed
[15:59:29] <shoky> you can do  .new_container > * { display:none }
[15:59:33] <RandomCouch> maybe I can be of assistance
[15:59:38] <shoky> and .fadeIn()  on all the stuff you put in,
[15:59:44] <shoky> but instead of that.. just put in a new div for example
[15:59:57] <Lianzinho> shoky: the > * does not work
[16:00:01] <boytoy> Anybody have any suggestions how to improve this? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/5KuGV/ - Packery + kittens / YouTube / Vimeo / SoundCloud
[16:00:23] <Lianzinho> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/5/
[16:01:09] <Lianzinho> that was the first thing I've tried when you told me that I need to hide before using fadeIn()
[16:01:10] <shoky> don't do > *   that was just to demonstrate to you that its possible
[16:01:25] <shoky> Lianzinho: you're still doing .fadeIn() on the container
[16:01:37] <shoky> but the container is not hidden..
[16:01:42] <tw2113> must...not...be the other conscience
[16:01:44] <Lianzinho> shoky: fuuuuuuuuuu!!!
[16:01:53] <Lianzinho> shoky: just saw that!
[16:01:57] <shoky> Lianzinho:  http://jsfiddle.net/zGKT4/6/
[16:02:00] <tw2113> do it Lianzinho, ignore that shoky guy
[16:02:16] <tw2113> >:)
[16:02:49] <Lianzinho> shoky: html(p).children().fadeIn() did that!
[16:03:24] <shoky> Lianzinho: yeah but that's gross,  that's a separate fade-in animation for each element you're putting it
[16:03:25] <shoky> in*
[16:03:35] <Lianzinho> this children() operation is much expensive ? Cause I'm using it like 4 times to do this substitutions
[16:03:41] <shoky> instead of putting them in their own div, and just .fadeIn() on that div
[16:04:43] <Lianzinho> shoky: nice.. will try it
[16:04:46] <Lianzinho> thanks a lot
[16:04:46] <Lianzinho> hehehe
[16:04:57] <shoky> no probbies
[16:05:03] * shoky stabs tw2113 in the face
[16:05:19] <shoky> (with a cake)
[16:05:57] <shoky> ok futurama time
[16:06:02] <tw2113> :D
[16:09:26] <Lianzinho> it worked!
[16:09:32] <Lianzinho> thanks guys
[16:09:52] <Lianzinho> tw2113: not for you... :D
[16:09:54] <Lianzinho> hehehehe
[16:09:55] <Lianzinho> kidding
[16:10:05] <tw2113> i know i was the red horned dude
[16:11:13] <Lianzinho> pink
[16:25:35] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/h4U9f/1/ - anybody know why my .restructure link seems to execute by itself?
[16:26:58] <Foxhoundz> Good god jsFiddle has become slow
[16:27:15] <tw2113> jsbin.com for all your fiddly needs
[16:27:32] <shoky> futurama was yummy
[16:29:57] <shoky> boytoy: that version of .toggle() has been removed in 1.9
[16:30:37] <tw2113> time to delete some github repos that used twitter api 1.0
[16:30:37] <boytoy> oh i see i see
[16:48:30] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6P59q/ I have JS which restructures my HTML on click. Is there a way to restore the original HTML other than manually re-restructuring the restructured HTML?
[16:49:35] <jeremy-> Hello, for some reason my jquery UI Autocomplete stopped working. I've tried over and over to attempt to work out what i did to broke it and I cant seem to work it out. The annoying thing is that it returns no console error. ANy tips on how i can troubleshoot it: http://pastebin.com/1mibFb2x
[16:51:20] <jeremy-> boytoy, one way would be to save the original html before changing it, thats a bad way to do it
[16:51:34] <jeremy-> the better way would be using jquerys .parent(), to find the div, then removing it
[16:52:02] <jeremy-> or alternatively, you could go the other way around, and work from the "div" that you add then remove its children(), etc
[16:53:37] <jeremy-> "remove parent container". google search, turns out jquery has made your job easier too
[16:53:40] <jeremy-> unwrap()
[16:53:40] <boytoy> jeremy-: I think I did something like that in http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6P59q/ - its just now that I've achieved my goal, I'd like to provide the user with an easy exit
[16:55:19] <boytoy> jeremy-: I guess I could save it like you suggested?
[16:55:25] <jeremy-> nono
[16:55:32] <jeremy-> unwrap
[16:55:38] <jeremy-> just does the reverse of your code
[16:56:19] <jeremy-> http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[16:56:20] <boytoy> so basically id have to manually re-restructure the restructured code?
[16:56:33] <jeremy-> well no, you could use a site wide selector to unwrap everything
[16:56:39] <boytoy> im already using unwrap
[16:56:39] <jeremy-> rather than naming each item
[16:56:52] <jeremy-> then i dont understand what your problem is, you "wrap" a div
[16:56:56] <jeremy-> then you asked how to remove those divs
[16:57:00] <jeremy-> "unwrap"
[16:57:20] <jeremy-> your issue is that at the moment you are wrapping each element manually
[16:57:22] <jeremy-> this is a bad idea
[16:57:28] <jeremy-> you want to use a selector to wrap everything in one go
[16:57:32] <jeremy-> then unwrap everything in one go
[16:58:56] <boytoy> wait let me rephrase. At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6P59q/ when you click "Restructure", it will change the HTML quite drastically. What I'm wondering is, is there an easy way to return the HTML to its original state rather than undoing all those DOM manipulations or whatever they're called?
[16:59:02] <shoky> jeremy-: your code is fine ;s
[16:59:58] <tw2113> store it in a variable before you change
[16:59:58] <shoky> jeremy-: i'd check the devtools network tab to see what's up with the requests/responses
[17:00:20] <tw2113> then on the revert part, fetch the variable
[17:00:46] <boytoy> hmm..
[17:00:57] <jeremy-> thanks shoky
[17:01:07] <jeremy-> What actually happened, my PC bluescreened
[17:01:10] <jeremy-> and eclipse was open
[17:01:13] <jeremy-> it blanked out some files
[17:01:17] <jeremy-> ever since then, i cant recreate it
[17:01:23] <jeremy-> i think maybe my local web server is broken or something
[17:01:28] <jeremy-> i dont understand
[17:01:39] <shoky> ohsies
[17:01:48] <jeremy-> in my network tab in chrome i can see a return of the correct label/value data
[17:01:57] <jeremy-> yet there is no console error and autocomplete does nothing
[17:02:04] <shoky> didnt you just say you cant recreate it
[17:02:14] <jeremy-> I've written it exactly as it was
[17:02:19] <jeremy-> i had a backup from an hour earlier
[17:02:20] <jeremy-> which i thought worked
[17:02:35] <jeremy-> nothing is working, i'm pulling out my hair bigtime
[17:03:06] <shoky> is the success callback getting called?
[17:03:19] <jeremy-> i should console.log that
[17:03:20] <jeremy-> good idea
[17:04:05] <jeremy-> Thats weird
[17:04:09] <jeremy-> i can see the request in chrome
[17:04:11] <jeremy-> and the return json
[17:04:11] <jeremy-> but
[17:04:15] <jeremy-> there is no success callback
[17:04:22] <jeremy-> maybe its an apache issue with the ajax request
[17:04:25] <shoky> put an error handler
[17:04:31] <shoky> and pastebin the response
[17:04:47] <shoky> not necessarily in that order
[17:05:46] <jeremy-> I didnt even realise i could use an error handler after success, thanks!
[17:05:48] <banisterfiend> what are the basic rules for when to use data-* vs ids vs classes ?
[17:06:48] <tw2113> the fact that they're different?
[17:07:40] <banisterfiend> tw2113: deep
[17:07:50] * shoky tases tw2113
[17:07:53] <tw2113> i wouldn't use data attributes for selectors
[17:08:09] <tw2113> i'd use them to store extra data that the user doesn't need to worry about
[17:08:16] <jeremy-> thanks for the help, but I have to head off to my job now, I think with that error handler i can really see whats going wrong, seeya shoky
[17:08:22] <jeremy-> thanks again
[17:08:36] <shoky> np jeremy-  its prolly some bad json or smth extra in the response
[17:08:51] <tw2113> but i could be wrong
[17:09:07] <tw2113> and i'm not sure if shoky is tasing me for fun or because i'm going down the wrong information rabbit hole
[17:09:28] <shoky> fun, and cause your first answer wasn't really an answer
[17:09:45] <tw2113> carry on then
[17:09:52] <shoky> "what are the basic rules for X?"   "the fact that they're different"
[17:09:55] <shoky> does not compute
[17:13:11] <banisterfiend> "how do i when do i use a hammer and when do i use a saw?" answer: "because they're different"
[17:13:24] <banisterfiend> do i know*
[17:14:49] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/oqamow/1/edit
[17:16:19] <banisterfiend> tw2113: thx, my question is really, i read somewhere that data-* attributes should be used to wire up your js, and classes should be used for styling
[17:16:34] <tw2113> IDs are still best for js
[17:16:38] <tw2113> classes are great for css
[17:16:48] <tw2113> data-* are still a bit up in the air, at least in my head
[17:16:52] <banisterfiend> ids aren't good for widgets
[17:17:01] <banisterfiend> cos i can have multiple of them on screen
[17:17:09] <banisterfiend> whereas ids would onl allow me to have 1 widget, no?
[17:17:09] <tw2113> only *great* use I've found in my own experience has been quickly switching youtube video IDs on click
[17:17:28] <tw2113> depends on how you implement them
[17:17:36] <tw2113> you could append a counter variable to the end of it
[17:18:29] <banisterfiend> sure i could, but that seems unnecessarily complicated when i could use just a data-*
[17:18:32] <tw2113> or wrap the widgets in a div/aside/whathaveyou with an ID
[17:18:35] <tw2113> and use that to get most of the way
[17:19:50] <banisterfiend> my real question is, i have a template that's used by a widget, in this template i have a div that is going to be styled a certain way (unique for that div) so i set a certain css class on it, is it ok to wire up my js based on this css class? or is it still best practice to define a data-* on it?
[17:20:19] <tw2113> knowing how i work, i'd still end up going the css route
[17:20:37] <banisterfiend> css?
[17:20:49] <banisterfiend> you mean you'd wire up based on the class?
[17:20:52] <tw2113> er class route
[17:20:55] <tw2113> yeah
[17:21:39] <tw2113> i only forgot "la"
[17:21:55] <banisterfiend> hehe
[17:24:21] <chee> people in here are generally pretty web-smart, this isn't actually jquery related but i'll probably get an answer
[17:24:38] <chee> is it acceptable to use a table with the hcard classes? will that work?
[17:25:46] <tw2113> chee, they'll hunt you down and punish you for that
[17:25:48] <tw2113> not really
[17:27:23] <chee> oh it turns out it works

[17:27:39] <chee> that's fun

[17:28:28] <tw2113> why wouldn't it?

[17:29:09] <tw2113> :P
[17:38:13] <wachpwnski> why is jquery sending OPTIONS instead of POST
[17:46:40] <Eviltwin> wachpwnski: Because you set type: "OPTIONS"?
[17:46:56] <wachpwnski> no i set POST
[17:48:38] <Eviltwin> How do you know jQuery is sending OPTIONS instead of POST?
[17:50:03] <wachpwnski> it's giving me something weird one second
[17:52:01] <wachpwnski> Eviltwin: it keeps giving me beautiful errors like so
[17:52:02] <wachpwnski> OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/ip-list-to-geolocation?key=mykey 400 (Bad Request) jquery.min.js:4
[17:52:02] <wachpwnski> OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/ip-list-to-geolocation?key=mykey Origin http://localhost:8080 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[17:54:30] <wachpwnski> This is how I am sending my request: http://jsfiddle.net/G64ff/3/
[17:58:56] <Nombrandue> I am trying to draw a single bar per JSON header data, with a min, and max, but I am not finding anything to do. Example of the data, would be a header of 'load' a min value of 0, max of 100, and dynamically draw the bar based on a change in the json provided data
[18:02:46] <wachpwnski> Nombrandue: like a progress bar?
[18:03:45] <Nombrandue> sort of. I am actually looking at graphing items off NUT, like my UPS load, in real time, along with other dynamically fed values. Progress bar might be closest, but I am not sure if it would work/look good, decreasing and increasing
[18:08:55] <shoky> wachpwnski: it's a CORS preflight request
[18:09:03] <shoky> wachpwnski: it's not jquery doing it, it's the browser
[18:09:34] <shoky> wachpwnski: it's triggered by a cross-domain POST with a non-form content-type
[18:09:51] <wachpwnski> hmmm
[18:10:05] <wachpwnski> Is there any way to fix it?
[18:10:20] <shoky> wachpwnski: your server needs to reply to it
[18:11:00] <shoky> and not with a 400 code
[18:15:41] <wachpwnski> shoky: the data i am sending isn't being picked up by the server
[18:15:45] <wachpwnski> it is literally sending null
[18:16:04] <shoky> wachpwnski:  i told you, its not even sending the actual request yet
[18:16:31] <shoky> wachpwnski:  one thing you could try if you wanna avoid the preflight request, is to set the contentType to 'text/plain'   instead of application/json
[18:16:50] <shoky> and your server needs to just guess that it's json, i suppose
[18:17:18] <wachpwnski> I am getting this: Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers
[18:17:28] <wachpwnski> now that I am just returning
[18:17:38] <shoky> dono what you're doing
[18:17:41] <shoky> "just returning" ?
[18:18:12] <shoky> try to send the request same as your fiddle is doing, just change the contentType to 'text/plain'
[18:19:27] <wachpwnski> lol
[18:19:37] <wachpwnski> that made it respond
[18:21:32] <wachpwnski> shoky: but for some reason the data I send is not being picked up by my api server
[18:22:07] <shoky> wachpwnski: i dont know what you're doing, i can't see from here, it's hard to help like this
[18:22:25] <wachpwnski>     request_data = request.json
[18:22:25] <wachpwnski>     return json.dumps(dict(ok=request_data))
[18:22:25] <shoky> either say exactly what you're doing and keep showing the updated code,
[18:22:40] <shoky> i don't even know what language that is
[18:22:50] <wachpwnski> python
[18:22:59] <shoky> can't help you there
[18:23:11] <shoky> what's request.json ..?
[18:23:18] <wachpwnski> on done(function(data){ console.log(data); }) is causin Object {ok: null}
[18:23:35] <shoky> then it's null..
[18:23:40] <shoky> #python
[18:23:42] <wachpwnski> it's the body of the request
[18:23:55] <shoky> doesn't look like it
[18:24:09] <wachpwnski> if i post with curl it will return the body
[18:24:33] <wachpwnski> {"ok": ["31.210.109.42", "81.177.170.217", "91.243.115.100"]}
[18:24:59] <shoky> do you see the browser sending the array?
[18:25:10] <shoky> in the post body
[18:28:01] <wachpwnski> in chrome how can I check that?
[18:28:06] <shoky> network tab..
[18:28:41] <tw2113> *pokes shoky's toe to check for grayscale*
[18:30:32] <shoky> *squints*
[18:31:38] <shoky> wachpwnski: "request.json" looks suspicious to me.. but i dont rly know
[18:32:48] <wachpwnski> thats the python code on my api server
[18:32:54] <shoky> i know
[18:32:59] <shoky> what about.. request.body ?
[18:33:08] <wachpwnski> it works fine with curl, just browser calling the request does something odd
[18:33:18] <shoky> what curl
[18:33:30] <wachpwnski> let me chekc the request body
[18:35:37] <wachpwnski> looks like request.body is an object
[18:37:37] <Ebonwumon> I have this page here: http://sc2ctl.com/tournament/1. I have a bunch of divs that have classes that start with "tid" and then a number. In the script I have $('[class^="tid"]') but it doesn't seem to be working on that page. Does anyone have any idea why this might be?
[18:37:58] <Ebonwumon> (you can see the script loading here: http://sc2ctl.com/scripts/scripts.js)
[18:40:37] <shoky> Ebonwumon:  $('[class^="tid"]')   looks for elements whose class attribute starts with "tid"
[18:40:52] <shoky> Ebonwumon: it doesnt look for elements that have a class that starts with "tid"
[18:41:17] <shoky> two very different things.   e.g.  class="class1 class2 tid5"  wouldn't be found by that selector
[18:41:18] <wachpwnski> shoky: looks like it's in request body not json
[18:41:41] <Ebonwumon> shoky, that's a pretty important distinction. Awesome. Is there a thing that does what I want, or do I have to do some processing on the class attribute?
[18:41:52] <shoky> Ebonwumon: you should really just give them a class "tid"   and use $('.tid')
[18:42:14] <Nombrandue> found out my problem with displaying my json data. needed to pass it through parseInt() to get any progressbar or graph to work
[18:42:18] <shoky> Ebonwumon: it's bad practice to put numbers in classes/ids like that for selecting
[18:42:26] <shoky> Ebonwumon: and you can see why
[18:43:22] <shoky> Ebonwumon: and you can put the numbers if you need them on a separate attribute e.g. data-tid="5"
[18:43:37] <Ebonwumon> Yeah shoky I just thought of and started doing that.
[18:43:41] <Ebonwumon> Thanks for the help
[18:46:39] <shoky> wachpwnski: where did you come up with "request.json" anyway
[19:06:50] <dalnet22> anyone know of an issue with position() in firefox? In chrome, $(r.canvas).position().left stays the same throughout my code, yet in firefox, $(r.canvas).position().left decreases
[19:07:50] <dalnet22> the decrease occurs when I attempt to change the viewbox of the canvas
[19:08:40] <Stephen> probably has to do with scrollbars being created or destroyed
[19:08:50] <Stephen> Any way you could post some code to look at?
[19:09:32] <dalnet22> I'll see if I can put a fiddle together
[19:37:35] <dalnet22> I love when I can't duplicate problems in jsfiddle
[19:45:13] <dalnet22> finally got it
[19:45:55] <dalnet22> ok in this jsfiddle, in chrome and IE, when I slide the bar, the circle gets larger, and left is constant. However, in firefox, left changes. http://jsfiddle.net/XfQgV/15/
[19:46:06] <dalnet22> any idea why it changes in firefox?
[20:00:27] <Stephen> just now opening, gimme abit
[20:01:34] <dalnet22> k
[20:02:49] <Stephen> ok, so what's the difference?
[20:03:16] <dalnet22> the difference impacts my real code because I depend on the value of position().left
[20:03:35] <dalnet22> in this jsfiddle, firefox shows a changed left value
[20:03:45] <tw2113> probably some difference in how the two browsers calculate this stuff
[20:03:59] <Stephen> oic
[20:06:17] <dalnet22> back in a few minutes
[20:09:48] <Stephen> I see it
[20:09:52] <Stephen> dalnet22
[20:09:57] <Stephen> Firefox isn't using canvas
[20:10:09] <Stephen> Raphael is creating an SVG element
[20:19:01] <Stephen> jquery hates SVG
[20:19:04] <Stephen> but there is hope
[20:23:23] <Stephen> Here's jquery's take on it:
[20:23:26] <Stephen> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9797
[20:25:26] <RobW> any isotope/masonry gurus here?
[20:31:32] <tms8707056> Can anybody tell me why my query plugin is only firing once via delegate? http://jsfiddle.net/D8m4D/
[20:31:49] <tms8707056> I need it to fire for every change to the radio control.
[20:33:03] <Stephen> dalnet22
[20:33:12] <Stephen> so, change your code in this way:
[20:38:21] <dalnet22> back
[20:38:58] <Stephen> so, it's a known bug
[20:39:00] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/XfQgV/19/
[20:39:00] <dalnet22> Stephen hmm saw your link
[20:39:03] <Stephen> Here's an update to help
[20:39:13] <Stephen> don't use .position()
[20:39:34] <dalnet22> Stephen thanks I'll give it a try
[20:40:32] <sammich> tms8707056: http://jsfiddle.net/D8m4D/3/
[20:41:22] <RobW> any isotope/masonry gurus here?
[20:42:18] <tw2113> just post your question RobW
[20:42:24] <tw2113> or you'll potentially be here awhile
[20:42:58] <tms8707056> sammich: thanksâ€¦ but I notice the animation has a jerkâ€¦ any ideas for fixing that?
[20:43:03] <RobW> Using isotope coupled with the masonry: cornerStampSelector options doesn't seem to "stamp" corners.. any ideas why?
[20:43:19] <RobW> these "stamped" corners still move as usual
[20:43:45] <tw2113> nope
[20:43:56] <sammich> I'm not 100% sure, but I've had that issue because jQuery doesn't know what the height of the element is
[20:44:21] <tms8707056> ok thanks for the help!
[20:46:43] <RobW> actually no
[20:46:46] <RobW> it was $.Isotope.prototype._masonryReset = function() {}
[20:46:52] <RobW> just noticed this in docs.. sigh
[20:51:29] <sammich> is .on() the new .delegate()?
[20:54:07] <dalnet22> Stephen that worked, thanks a lot
[21:28:59] <Stephen> awesome dalnet22
[21:29:02] <Stephen> I win :-)
