[00:22:47] <Guest30405> btw i figured it out
[00:22:50] <Guest30405> you were right
[00:22:56] <Guest30405> i commented out my success function
[00:22:58] <Guest30405> :[
[00:39:05] <Majicpanda> is there an easy toggle i can do on click, all .player_hotkey within #player_hotkeys get removed from a href links and then on a function ajax callback add the class back?
[00:56:59] <aaairc> can you define a javascript object like.... var object = {"car":"toyota","compact":true};
[01:00:47] <MBehtemam> hi , i cant select a button from ajax recived http://snipt.org/ufghj9
[01:01:57] <MBehtemam> when clicking on button it didint fire the event
[03:14:26] <KyleSmith> Hi, can anyone tell me why the jquery image loading fade is in basically crap?
[03:14:27] <KyleSmith> kylesmithphotography.co.uk
[03:14:34] <KyleSmith> It don't fade in, but loads slowly.
[03:14:40] <KyleSmith> 'chunk by chunk;
[03:14:43] <KyleSmith> '*
[03:15:33] <seltar> from top to bottom you mean?
[03:17:04] <seltar> KyleSmith: the images are png, and they don't really need to be.. they are around 3-400 kb a pop, which makes for slow loading
[03:30:51] <KyleSmith> yes seltar
[03:31:00] <KyleSmith> ah
[03:31:23] <KyleSmith> What filetype do you suggest for them to be?
[03:41:55] <peol> KyleSmith: Also, you're using 1.3.2… You should *really* update to 1.7.1
[03:42:44] <KyleSmith> Wow, I only created the site a month back. Never knew it updates so quick
[03:43:45] <peol> KyleSmith: 1.7.0 was released early november :)
[03:43:47] <Woet> KyleSmith: jQuery 1.7.1 came out November 2011
[03:44:26] <KyleSmith> Oh, strange. God knows why I have this version.
[03:54:29] <aqeel> hi room
[03:57:03] <aqeel> $("#bar").css("width", + (++progress) +"%");................how can i set it like while contents are loading in div this will progress accoringly...???
[03:58:56] <KyleSmith> Guys, I changed image types to JPG and reduced file size to 90 - 110k and still it loads in blocks but it loads in quick blocks.
[03:59:11] <KyleSmith> I also updated the jquery.
[03:59:23] <aqeel> ???
[04:20:17] <_nicola_> hi, how can manage the click of a user on a radio button element to show a list box
[04:24:29] <_nicola_> for example if I want to show country list only if user click on "other country" option
[04:33:05] <miket3> _nicola_, you are making the task more difficult than it needs to be.
[04:33:20] <miket3> just use a select list with a default value
[04:33:50] <miket3> if the user wants another country he can click on the slect list
[04:35:07] <miket3> it will be more intuitive for you as the developer and more intuitive for your users
[04:42:14] <_nicola_> miket3 there are too many values. I explain better.
[04:42:29] <_nicola_> the user should choose where he lives
[04:42:48] <_nicola_> four choises
[04:42:52] <_nicola_> 1. in the town
[04:42:55] <_nicola_> 2. in other town
[04:42:58] <_nicola_> 3. in other country
[04:43:11] <_nicola_> and so on
[04:43:39] <_nicola_> if he choose in other town the list of town should appear in  a combobox
[04:44:00] <_nicola_> if he choose another country the list of the country should be show
[04:44:25] <_nicola_> that's why I would like to trace the click events
[04:46:16] <aaairc> i'm using the .html() function, in this example  http://jsfiddle.net/2ubsw/3/   but instead dropping in HTML it drops in a String of the HTML
[04:46:48] <aaairc> does anyone know how to fix this, utilizing the detail javascript object you see in the example
[04:51:55] <aaairc> anyone on here right now?
[04:56:25] <miket3> aaairc, use <  instead of &lt;
[04:57:32] <aaairc> miket3: that is how the string is returned from a service
[04:58:11] <miket3> aaairc, well you will have to convert it  it seems
[04:59:37] <aaairc> is there a jquery function i could use to automatically convert or escape the charecters being written out as unicode or whatever that is and writing it in normal text which is what it translates into?
[04:59:46] <aaairc> or in Java?
[05:04:31] <aaairc> found a solution if your interested
[05:04:31] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/2ubsw/4/
[05:08:29] <paissad> guys, when i do this -->         $(selector + ' ul').append("<input type='checkbox' name='loc_type' />"); <--- i have the following --> <input type="checkbox" name="loc_type">
[05:08:29] <paissad> but i would like to close the tag, i want to have <input /> and not <input>
[05:12:15] <miket3> aaairc, http://jsfiddle.net/QPAaa/
[05:15:01] <criz_> hello
[05:16:22] <_nicola_> criz_ hi
[05:21:32] <Someus> How can i enable jquery styled buttons?
[05:21:49] <Someus> <button>Button</button> it`s just outputs old style
[05:21:58] <Misiur> Someus: jQuery ui button
[05:22:22] <Someus> Misiur, sorry more specific please..
[05:22:24] <miket3> paissad, name='loc_type' \/>
[05:22:39] <Misiur> Someus: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/ - check out source
[05:22:47] <paissad> miket3, got to escape the slashes ? o_0
[05:23:07] <paissad> for which reason ?
[05:23:25] <miket3> paissad, i am only guessing... sorry
[05:25:57] <miket3> paissad, did that work?
[05:26:13] <Someus> Misiur so it`s javascript that does that UI enabled right?
[05:26:43] <Someus> And CSS is already created
[05:26:46] <Someus> I see
[05:26:48] <Someus> know
[05:27:19] <Guest96565> Does anyone know why the jquery-ui website is down?
[05:27:21] <paissad> miket3, no
[05:27:46] <Someus> down?
[05:27:59] <Guest96565> Well, serverley messed up
[05:28:23] <Guest96565> Looks like some missing css and javscript files or something
[05:29:21] <miket3> paissad, paste your thing into jsfiddle maybe i can fiddle with it
[05:31:02] <miket3> Guest96565, site looks good to me on FF
[05:32:08] <Guest96565> miket3, I've tried both chrome and ff, giving ie a go now
[05:33:07] <paissad> miket3, http://jsfiddle.net/dE7UD/1/
[05:36:07] <paissad> miket3, sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/dE7UD/4/
[05:38:10] <Someus> Thanks miket3
[05:38:13] <Someus> For link
[05:39:49] <Guest96565> miket3, thanks, it seems to work fine in ie9. Out of interest, do you see a very boring webpage with black text on a white background?
[05:39:57] <Misiur> http://jsfiddle.net/d4ycu/ What I want to achieve is to preserve the 50/50 rate of fieldsets, but my JS is failing. What am I doing wrong?
[05:40:17] <miket3> Guest96565, it looks 100% fine to me
[05:40:42] <miket3> very colorful
[05:40:52] <Guest96565> Interesting, anyway, thanks for the help :)
[05:41:39] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/U5PNJ/
[05:41:41] <miket3> Guest96565, make sure Js enabled in your other browsers....
[05:46:06] <miket3> paissad, sorry what you patsed doesn work at all
[05:48:48] <Someus> A like the simplicity of JQuery
[05:49:05] <Someus> Does google Buttons use JQuery?
[05:49:12] <Someus> just curious..
[05:51:43] <paissad> miket3, http://jsfiddle.net/dE7UD/7/, i see no reason why this does not work o_0, it's ok for me when i use it in chrome
[05:51:54] <paissad> s/use/view
[05:53:29] <miket3> paissad, not even chrome for me
[05:54:11] <Misiur> paissad: "zoo" : "zoo", };
[05:54:13] <paissad> miket3, i meant, in jsfiddle, i see nothing, but the same works for me when i use Chrome (not into jsfiddle ... weird)
[05:54:16] <Misiur> This is syntax error
[05:54:25] <Misiur> you can't have comma after last element
[05:54:30] <Misiur> unlike php
[05:54:43] <miket3> paissad, not wierd....   becuase i think chrome is too smart for its own good
[05:54:59] <miket3> you are missing jquery loader
[05:57:36] <miket3> paissad,  donde esta $(document).ready(function()  statement
[05:58:01] <miket3> ?
[05:58:06] <Misiur> paissad: Also
[05:58:23] <Misiur> in jsfiddle you have onDomReady/onLoad called automatically
[05:58:59] <paissad> miket3, jsfiddle calls it automatically, no ?
[06:00:45] <Misiur> paissad: http://jsfiddle.net/dE7UD/11/
[06:03:20] <paissad> Misiur, thanks, i understand better now
[06:04:48] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/U5PNJ/1/
[06:04:52] <aqeel> not working
[06:05:03] <aqeel> bar will not hide...
[06:05:34] <miket3> Misiur, nice.
[06:06:44] <Misiur> aqeel: Provide us with html too
[06:06:58] <aqeel> ok..
[06:09:04] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[06:09:12] <aqeel> see source code
[06:11:41] <Misiur> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/U5PNJ/2/ try this
[06:17:18] <miket3> paissad, you need to do some coding to get that form into xhtml shape... something like grab the .html()  and .replace(">","/>")
[06:22:42] <Misiur> What would be the easiest way to determine if element has scroll visible?
[06:23:21] <aqeel> ok
[06:30:09] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/k3eDh/ - why did the author wrap the shipping address fieldset in a div and animate that instead of the fieldset itself?
[06:32:43] <aqeel> misiur.....this one jumps without any interaction of loading.....i was looking for the loading according to the content in the page loaded...
[06:32:59] <aqeel> well it does work...its purpose..
[06:33:17] <erdos> hey peeps
[06:33:20] <aqeel> guess i have to test with a big pic in it
[06:33:22] <Someus> Do you know where to find some simple and minimalistic web themes?
[06:34:10] <erdos> with the .scroll() handler, how can i tell which way the scroll is going?
[06:34:55] <erdos> Someus: themes for what?
[06:34:55] <dabear> Misiur: http://jsfiddle.net/MbXGG/
[06:38:27] <dabear> erdos: you cannot directly. You can however compare the value of yourelem.clientHeight and yourelem.clientWidth to see which of them has changed
[06:38:36] <dabear> which would give you the direction
[06:38:39] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/k3eDh/ - why did the author wrap the shipping address fieldset in a div and animate that instead of the fieldset itself?
[06:38:56] <guy> What's the trigger for "onload" in this context?
[06:38:58] <guy> $('textarea[name="ay[description]"]').on('keyup onload', function(e){
[06:39:10] <erdos> damn, i don't want the page itself to scroll, i just want to hook into the event so i can invoke a horizonal jqueryui scroll
[06:39:14] <erdos> scroller
[06:39:22] <guy> basically, I want it triggered once the element is loaded
[06:39:32] <dabear> erdos: you gotta save yourelem.clientHeight to a variable before scrolling, and when scrolling compare the current clientHeight to the value stored
[06:39:38] <Misiur> dabear: thanks
[06:39:57] <erdos> i sec, googling clientheight
[06:40:00] <dabear> eh, Misiur*
[06:40:23] <dabear> two questions about scrolling makes me confused :p
[06:40:46] <erdos> heh
[06:41:12] <erdos> dabear: but clientheight will only change if a vertical scrollbar exists right?
[06:41:24] <erdos> http://testbed.labfiftyfive.com/shmoz2
[06:42:15] <dabear> erdos: use clientWIdth instead
[06:43:32] <erdos> sorry, i'm confused, i wouldn't have thought it would change unless something moved? so if i scroll my mousewheel on the page at the moment clientWidth won't change will it?
[06:48:01] <dabear> erdos: it will be easier for you to just check parseFloat($("div.scroll-content").css("marginLeft"))
[06:49:12] <erdos> that will just give me the position of the content though right?
[06:49:29] <dabear> yep, which will change when scrolling
[06:50:11] <erdos> heh, that bit's fine, but i can't figure out how to hook into the scroll event! i can get it, but i can't distinguish which way they're scrolling
[06:50:29] <dabear> left or right?
[06:50:31] <erdos> and because there's no natural scroll bars on the page nothing moves, so there's nothing to test it against
[06:50:38] <dabear> there is
[06:51:01] <dabear> and thats the value I told you
[06:51:05] <erdos> clientWidth?
[06:51:22] <dabear> if the value of parseFloat($("div.scroll-content").css("marginLeft")) is -800
[06:51:34] <dabear> and a second later the same value is -1000
[06:52:10] <dabear> then the scrollbar has been scrolled to the right
[06:52:24] <erdos> oh sorry, i didn't explain myself correctly
[06:52:37] <erdos> i meant the scrollwheel on the mouse
[06:52:49] <erdos> that's the event i need to make sense of
[06:52:50] <erdos> sorry
[06:53:17] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Demo.aautoscroll.htm
[06:54:16] <dabear> erdos: event.originalEvent.axis
[06:54:29] <erdos> awesome thankyou!
[06:54:40] <dabear> works in firefox 3.5++
[06:54:49] <aqeel> i also going to implement into my site
[06:55:22] <erdos> at least i can google from there to find the others, cheers :)
[06:55:50] <erdos> aqeel: thanks for the link but i think we're trying to achieve different things!
[06:56:29] <aqeel> oh ok..
[06:56:46] <erdos> i'm going for something like this: http://niketo.com/
[06:57:48] <aqeel> sorry can't open....?
[06:58:00] <aqeel> The connection was reset                                                                The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.                                The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few     moments.   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network     connection.   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure     
[06:58:11] <erdos> try refresh
[06:58:30] <erdos> it's worth it!
[06:58:31] <aqeel> same
[06:58:46] <erdos> weird
[07:02:14] <erdos> got him! e.originalEvent.wheelDelta and e.originalEvent.detail
[07:06:03] <erdos> >_<
[07:18:39] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/k3eDh/ - why did the author wrap the shipping address fieldset in a div and animate that instead of the fieldset itself?
[07:21:01] <opie-x> mikkelb: i don't know for sure, but maybe fieldsets animate weird in some browsers
[07:22:14] <opie-x> i.e. maybe in IE fieldset doesn't have a height value, or the height is calculated strangely
[07:22:23] <opie-x> that'd be my guess, or it's a consistency thing
[07:22:39] <opie-x> we've built animation containers
[07:23:00] <opie-x> it's nice to say, $("div.animation-container").play() or .rewind()
[07:23:28] <opie-x> and have it be a more of a marker containaer then a styling container
[07:25:16] <mikkelb> opie-x: cool
[07:25:24] <mikkelb> real cool man
[07:25:31] <opie-x> just a guess
[07:25:33] <mikkelb> makes a lotta sense too, thank you for that extraordinary piece of insight
[07:25:51] <opie-x> i feel like i should tip my hat or somethig =)
[07:27:17] <mikkelb> haha
[07:27:59] <opie-x> yeah, that idea of having a wrapping element to define behavior works well for async updates too, like imagine that the additiional address peice
[07:28:31] <opie-x> was loaded with ajax after the user clicked on the button there, well now you just ajax load that field set code right into the div and
[07:28:33] <opie-x> good to go
[07:30:12] <opie-x> well, that was poorly written, but hopefully the idea come across
[07:31:16] <plln> i am triying to write print function
[07:31:18] <plln> http://jsfiddle.net/k2wde/
[07:32:04] <erdos> laters
[07:33:21] <opie-x> yeah, i don't think you can pass a url to window.print
[07:33:42] <plln> sorry wrong function
[07:34:12] <plln> updated !
[07:34:41] <opie-x> yeah
[07:35:31] <plln> its opening a window, it trying write to printer but it freezing probably i close window to quickly
[07:35:41] <opie-x> yeah, that'd be my guess
[07:36:19] <plln> no its writing only blank screen
[07:36:21] <Interested_Party> Hey I'm trying to get a "bing" style image hotspot effect, I found the jquery highlight library but I'm not sure the best way to accomplish this, can anyone help me understand how to go about it?
[07:36:58] <plln> any idea
[07:37:24] <opie-x> plln: writing, the printer is printing a blank page?
[07:38:08] <sarspazam> is there a way to veritcally centre content with jQuery, without adding another div?
[07:39:11] <sarspazam> i've used this http://cool-javascripts.com/jquery/vertical-alignment-of-contents-inside-an-element-using-jquery.html
[07:39:19] <sarspazam> which adds a div to centre
[07:39:53] <Interested_Party> Seriously?  Nobody has *ever* tried to create a "bing image" effect?
[07:40:52] <sarspazam> another problem with that is that it doesn't recentre the div when resizing the window
[07:41:20] <aqeel> sarspazam....................outer div.....display table.....inner div display table-cell vertical-align middle..................$("outer div").height($(document).height());
[07:41:24] <sarspazam> if you put the function inside a window resize event it it dies
[07:41:25] <aqeel> this is dead centeer
[07:41:41] <sarspazam> doesn't that mean you'd need to use tables?
[07:41:56] <sarspazam> and not dies, it just repeatedly adds divs within divs
[07:42:01] <aqeel> outer div......margin 0 auto......
[07:42:11] <sarspazam> to center horizontally
[07:42:12] <aqeel> nooooooooooo
[07:42:20] <aqeel> css property display:table
[07:42:46] <aqeel> i have done that wanna see
[07:43:16] <sarspazam> if its all css do I just need to add any jquery besides setting the div to that of window height?
[07:44:54] <aqeel> nope
[07:45:23] <sarspazam> execellnt, cheers aqeel
[07:45:29] <aqeel> let me jsfiddle for u
[07:45:39] <sarspazam> why thank you
[07:46:25] <sarspazam> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21571136/CentredDiv.html this is how i've done it before but can't say I'm happy with the code
[07:48:10] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/EW6G8/
[07:49:15] <sarspazam> this is a much much cleaner way of doing it
[07:49:31] <aqeel> yup i did like that
[07:50:17] <aqeel> this simulates as if u are true;y working with table...
[07:50:35] <aqeel> vertical align is table property
[07:50:48] <sarspazam> yeah
[07:50:52] <plln> yes
[07:51:08] <aqeel> so it forces the table cell to be dead middle
[07:52:37] <aqeel> display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;...............dead middle center........and using javascript takes screen height into account
[07:53:08] <aqeel> well using height 100% does not work and therefore javascript works for me
[07:56:21] <asher^^> does anyone here familiar with jquery ui know if theres a way to change the radio button widget from a horizontal to vertical list?
[07:59:04] <fotoflo> hmm, i have a 						<button id = "submitSearch" type="button">search</button>  $("#nextResultsButton").click(function(){  submitSearch() } ;   i don't actually want the button to refresh the page, but it is now. any idea why/how to stop that?
[07:59:55] <fotoflo> whoops -- the selector in that question is wrong, it should be $("#submitSearch")
[08:01:07] <Aidanie> If I have a bunch of classes with the following format <li class="thisclass"><a class="item">x</a> Hello </li>. How would I extract the "Hello" part of all "thisclass" elements?
[08:02:22] <plln> http://jsfiddle.net/k2wde/2/
[08:02:44] <plln> it opens window its prints window but its not prints what i need
[08:03:12] <fotoflo> Aidanie: $('.thisclass').text() ?
[08:03:21] <xenaxon> hi
[08:03:23] <xenaxon> $('.sub-menu').has('ul').addClass('sub-menu-arrow'); // all other levels
[08:06:51] <plln> isthere any function in javascript for delaying
[08:07:13] <plln> example sleep(1000)  // code waits 1 sec
[08:07:14] <dabear> Aidanie: http://jsfiddle.net/p9bAt/
[08:07:17] <fotoflo> plin: window.setTimeout
[08:08:04] <plln> fotoflo: thank you
[08:09:01] <Aidanie> dabear: Thanks :)
[08:09:17] <fotoflo> plin: no problem

[08:15:01] <sarspazam> humm looks like display:table cell puts height:100% on the div
[08:15:50] <sarspazam> not sure that's a problem though when it comes to actually making a site
[08:20:40] <maffelu> Using jquerys animation in loops is tricky, is there a safe way to pause loop execution until the animation is done?
[08:24:29] <xenaxon> does anyone have any idea how to vertical align a dropdown ul to it's parent ul>li
[08:24:30] <xenaxon> ?
[08:24:33] <Robbo_> What would be the best way to animate a row of images from right to left? That would also wrap. Making it wrap I'm not too worried about at the moment, just need to know the best method to make it scroll
[08:24:35] <xenaxon> so far it's appearing at the top of it
[08:24:50] <kkuno> maffelu, you should use the callback function of the animation
[08:25:00] <rue> xenaxon: “It”?
[08:25:07] <rue> The li?
[08:25:10] <maffelu> kkuno, yea, that's the standard way, but is there no better way?
[08:26:16] <xenaxon> the ul>li>ul
[08:26:27] <xenaxon> the dropdown of a dropdown
[08:26:43] <xenaxon> first one appears correctly (bellow main level link)
[08:26:56] <xenaxon> second dropdown, appears at top of parent ul, which is not good
[08:27:11] <plln> is some one knows how to get first row in jquery datatables plugin
[08:27:13] <xenaxon> i think it's a css issue
[08:27:29] <xenaxon> but maybe you guys know how to fix this since many of the dropdowns today are made in jquery
[08:28:29] <xenaxon> http://www.themetumbler.com/this.png
[08:30:57] <xenaxon> rue: http://www.hostpic.org/images/92Untitled.png
[08:31:02] <xenaxon> rue: this is the issue
[08:36:23] <fotoflo> hmm, reading http://api.jquery.com/change/ --- there's gotta be something better then this: i want to fire whenever the value of the <input> changes…
[08:37:25] <dabear> fotoflo: keyup
[08:37:32] <dabear> keydown
[08:37:42] <fotoflo> dabear: only works if user is typing into the input
[08:38:04] <dabear> as opposed to what?
[08:38:18] <fotoflo> for example, copy-paste
[08:38:28] <fotoflo> or using dictation software
[08:38:36] <makinen> 1
[08:38:37] <fotoflo> or any other change
[08:38:54] <fotoflo> or javascript changes the form field
[08:38:59] <fotoflo> etc etc
[08:39:38] <Zogot> can always use focusout
[08:39:42] <dabear> bind to input or paste events
[08:40:06] <dabear> or propertychange
[08:40:17] <xenaxon> http://www.hostpic.org/images/92Untitled.png
[08:40:28] <xenaxon> any idea how to make sub-menu vertically align to top of containing li?
[08:40:34] <fotoflo> Zogot: my user is likely never focusout-ing
[08:41:14] <xenaxon> I've tried to align submenu with containing li
[08:41:19] <xenaxon> but can't seem to do that in css
[08:41:42] <fotoflo> dabear: ill try property change
[08:42:13] <dabear> xenaxon: set position absolute on the last menu
[08:42:32] <dabear> and get the height/position of the second to last menu
[08:42:49] <dabear> and apply same pos to the last
[08:43:13] <xenaxon> 	position:absolute;
[08:43:15] <xenaxon> it is
[08:43:22] <maffelu> anyone else ever have the problem, might be when using easing, with animations not really ending up exactly where you placed them after changing top or left css attributes=
[08:43:23] <maffelu> ?
[08:43:24] <dabear> xenaxon: http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[08:43:36] <xenaxon> dabear, you think I can do this with css?
[08:44:06] <fotoflo> dabear: i think keyup is going to be the best...
[08:44:34] <fotoflo> i guess i could bind to paste as well to cover all the bases
[08:44:59] <dabear> xenaxon: probably not, because you don't know the correct position of the li onbeforehand
[08:45:32] <dabear> xenaxon: maybe if you have nested ul li ul li structure
[08:45:42] <dabear> ask in #css ?
[08:51:26] <sebastian_o|> hey guys
[08:53:12] <fotoflo> hmm, I've just moved my project off of localhost, on to a live web server. and all of a sudden my cookies are set and clearing doesn't work
[08:53:30] <aqeel> sarspazam.....................no need for......content span { 			height:100px; width:100px; 			display:block; 			background:yellow; 		}
[08:53:33] <fotoflo> set to :__utma=251937683.1689822237.1326964377.1326964377.1331344431.2; __utmz=251937683.1326964377.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none);
[08:53:37] <fotoflo> any idea what this is?
[08:53:59] <aqeel> just give height and width to your table div
[08:54:34] <aqeel> .content-frame { 			display:table; 			margin:0 auto; 		width:100px; height100px;}
[08:54:52] <sarspazam> with display:table thought it sets the yellow div to height:100%, no?
[08:55:04] <sarspazam> or display:table-cell as it is on that div
[08:55:12] <xenaxon> dabear: I do have nested ul li ul li structure
[08:55:19] <xenaxon> but don't know how to align
[08:55:26] <xenaxon> here's a live link:
[08:55:30] <xenaxon> dabear: http://www.themetumbler.com/ubusiness/
[08:55:52] <aqeel> no if height and width speciifed....will take that into account and not automatically set to 100%
[08:55:53] <fotoflo> hmm, it appears to be google analytics stuff (thanks google), but why isn't it getting cleared with my other cookies?
[08:56:54] <sarspazam> have a look now aqeel http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21571136/CentredDiv.html
[08:57:02] <sarspazam> i've put those styles on .content
[08:59:22] <Reacted> hi
[08:59:52] <Reacted> im having trouble with a $.get, the returned data is always null, ive tried both php and go
[09:00:04] <Reacted> is there something obvious i could have missed?
[09:00:49] <imanc> i'm looking for some basic string formatting functions similar to sprintf for js or jquery. Any ideas?
[09:02:42] <Robbo_> I am doing a scrolling animation which is fairly slow but looks very jittery, is there anything I can do to stop this?
[09:03:46] <aqeel> <sarspazam> working on it for u
[09:04:08] <sarspazam> heh, thanks very much aqeel.  i'm toying around with it aswell
[09:04:20] <sarspazam> the fewer the divs the better :D
[09:07:52] <aqeel> but u are using js for height is causing your problem
[09:08:05] <aqeel> $('.content-frame').height($(window).height());
[09:08:17] <aqeel> it is full screen window heiht
[09:08:23] <aqeel> height*
[09:09:37] <sarspazam> you're right, i shouldn't need to set that twice
[09:10:18] <aqeel> hey i got it
[09:10:24] <sarspazam> ah you have?
[09:10:34] <sarspazam> i've removed the dynamic height of .content-frame
[09:10:42] <sarspazam> but that prevents the vertical align
[09:13:34] <pen> I have an object like this {key: {key1: value1}, key2: {...}} I want to make it into {top: {key: {key1: value1}}, key2: {...}}
[09:13:37] <pen> how do I do that?
[09:13:44] * sarspazam dying to know aqeel ;p
[09:14:05] <aqeel> wait last bit
[09:30:15] <maffelu> can one do x == y == z if one wants to know if x,y and z are equal?
[09:31:36] <sarspazam> you'd have to split it into 2 no?  x == y && x == z
[09:33:05] <maffelu> sarspazam, :(

[09:43:08] <aqeel> your div is all a mess...
[09:43:14] <aqeel> may i recode it for u
[09:43:17] <aqeel> ???
[09:43:36] <sarspazam> well, you're more than welcome to yes
[09:43:49] <sarspazam> what did you change to get the div to stay centred
[09:43:50] <aqeel> ok
[09:43:54] <sarspazam> but the text not?
[09:47:39] <magic_hat> Hi all. I'm using jquery ui's autocomplete method, and I need to get it to update a div with a chunk of html returned by the server, rather than the standard ul with labels. Something like http://pastie.org/3571759. Help?
[09:49:57] <jqwerty> what is the best place to post jquery Q's - official forum, Stack Overflow or other?
[09:50:10] <johnkpaul> magic_hat: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[09:50:15] <johnkpaul> did you try that?
[09:55:09] <magic_hat> johnkpaul: I have to admit I found that example code really confusing.
[09:55:47] <magic_hat> I did give it a go but wasn't able to get it to render anything that wasn't in <ul><li> format.
[09:59:04] <johnkpaul> magic_hat: by default, it is going to be ul and li, you are going to hack around it if you don't want to use ul and li at all
[09:59:18] <johnkpaul> why do you need that though, wouldn't it be fine if you could arbitrarily have other elements in your li?
[09:59:43] <johnkpaul> here's a hack for it - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2435964/jqueryui-how-can-i-custom-format-the-autocomplete-plug-in-results, but I don't think that you'd need to do that
[10:00:00] <johnkpaul> if you want arbitrary html, you can do that withtou removing the ul/li system that it comes with by default
[10:00:00] <magic_hat> Well, my controller is rendering a rails partial, and I'd rather just stick with that development pattern if I can rather than muck around with the presentation in jquery.
[10:02:49] <magic_hat> johnkpaul: alternatively, if I could get .change to work without a change of focus, I could just roll my own autocomplete.
[10:04:17] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know much about rails, but I'd expect that a partial would be a template somewhere that you could make a li easily, no?
[10:04:46] <johnkpaul> or, you coul dhave your controller send json instead of wrorying about a partial
[10:05:14] <magic_hat> johnkpaul:  yeah, but it's a complicated partial.
[10:05:25] <magic_hat> I guess that many be my only option, but... yuck. lol
[10:05:57] <johnkpaul> maybe it's arails thing, but I don't see that as a yuck
[10:06:31] <johnkpaul> isn't rails prebuilt for all that restynes?
[10:07:38] <johnkpaul> I had always assumed that rails default generated stuff could just be passed /users/show accept-encoding json
[10:07:41] <johnkpaul> and boom, it woudl all wokr
[10:08:03] <johnkpaul> (I'm actually asking, because I'd love to know)
[10:09:31] <magic_hat> johnkpaul: yes, it'd be really easy to render a json response to autocomplete. but the styling and stuff would be a pain to implement on the js side.
[10:10:13] <johnkpaul> hm, this must be some really really complicated looking autocomplete, I'd expect the css to handle all of that
[10:11:24] <johnkpaul> so magic_hat, if you want to go through the trouble, you'll have to monkey patch autocomplete
[10:11:41] <johnkpaul> more so than the SO link that I sent earlier describes
[10:12:03] <johnkpaul> it would probably be just as yuck if not yuicker than messing with rails
[10:12:10] <johnkpaul> so it's up to you as to which one you are more comfortable with
[10:12:51] <johnkpaul> also, instead of using change, if you were to roll you're own, you'd need to use keyup
[10:12:54] <magic_hat> Lol. thanks.
[10:12:55] <johnkpaul> and you could debounce it
[10:13:19] <johnkpaul> :) no problem, sorry I couldn't be of more help or have happier news
[10:14:27] <magic_hat> keyup actually looks really easy.
[10:17:49] <aqeel> sarspazam......................http://jsfiddle.net/WLLmR/
[10:18:22] <aqeel> since u have your js...i do not want to touch that thus i used your code and modified it
[10:18:32] <aqeel> u there?
[10:19:03] <magic_hat> johnkpaul: the other probblem w/ rendering json is that I need images to display in the <li>'s and autocomplete was only rendering text. not sure how to get around that one.
[10:19:49] <aroman> What would a selector to match elements that have a 'data-target' attribute, but not a 'data-child' attribute look like?
[10:19:51] <johnkpaul> magic_hat: to do that, you can use the custom display example from the jquery ui website
[10:20:02] <johnkpaul> you can append whatever elements you want to the li
[10:20:03] <aroman> :[data-target]:not(:[data-child]) is what I've come up with, but it doesn't work.
[10:20:06] <magic_hat> johnkpaul: gotcha
[10:20:37] <aroman> (It matches all data-target elements, including ones with data-child)
[10:21:35] <johnkpaul> aroman: did you try making two calls?
[10:21:48] <aroman> johnkpaul: what do you mean?
[10:21:51] <johnkpaul> ?not @aroman

[10:22:52] <aroman> (And I can't split up the selector into two parts)
[10:23:24] <johnkpaul> I don't know if you can do it in one pass using a single selector
[10:23:47] <aqeel> sarspazam....................is he around.........any one knows?
[10:24:02] <aroman> i don't see why I wouldn't be able to. I could do it if it were a 'div', but I'm using a 'data-target' attribute instead
[10:24:42] <aqeel> how do i get someone attention in this forum?
[10:24:51] <aqeel> any thing like buzz or alike
[10:25:10] <aroman> johnkpaul: wow, derp.
[10:25:23] <aroman> my selector was working perfectly fine. I just forgot to add 'data-child' to the HTML xD
[10:25:29] <aroman> thanks for the help anyhow
[10:25:38] <johnkpaul> :D no problem
[10:26:04] <johnkpaul> aqeel: are you looking for attention or sarspazam?
[10:26:17] <aqeel> sarspazam
[10:26:27] <aroman> just typing his name will alert him
[10:26:33] <aroman> (as you just did)
[10:27:01] <aqeel> u see i had his problem solved and am going to go.....so i would like to hand him over...
[10:29:24] <aroman> aqeel: if you just want to leave him a message, just type it. He'll see it when he gets back.

[10:41:12] <johnkpaul> ah macmartine
[10:41:22] <johnkpaul> so the first index call doesn't work
[10:41:26] <johnkpaul> because index doesn't check children
[10:43:28] <macmartine> johnkpaul: got it: $('.items').find('#client_2').index()
[10:44:11] <johnkpaul> hm but why doesn't $(".items").children().index("#client_2") work?
[10:44:44] <pifantastic> if #client_2 is an ID, all you need is $("#client_2")
[10:45:02] <pifantastic> the $(".items").find is unecessary
[10:45:14] <johnkpaul> yeah, but that might be a bug
[10:45:24] <macmartine> johnkpaul: seems like it should!

[10:47:25] <macmartine> yeah, they are unique

[10:49:13] <pifantastic> ohh
[10:49:18] <pifantastic> yeah, you're using index() wrong
[10:49:39] <johnkpaul> oh, how?
[10:49:43] <macmartine> hah
[10:49:49] <johnkpaul> index takes a selector, no?

[11:21:57] <johnkpaul> I'm trying to avoid the functional style of tests
[11:21:57] <lastent> Hi, I two buttons inside a form, they both are bind one is triggering the action it is bind to the other triggers the action but also submit the form, why they are different? what can I do?
[11:22:08] <johnkpaul> but thank you seltar, I didn't know about that
[11:22:25] <seltar> no problem
[11:22:30] <johnkpaul> I'm trying to mock it out in such a way that my unit test can run some code and make some assumptions about the scrollbar
[11:22:41] <johnkpaul> without actually having a scrollbar and document.body height high enough to have a scrollbar
[11:23:06] <seltar> ah.. well, make a small div with scroll content
[11:23:29] <seltar> or does it have to be the scrollbar on the document
[11:23:54] <johnkpaul> well, I'm trying to mock something out that is called using $(window).scroll(()
[11:24:05] <johnkpaul> basically, in the same way that I can trigger a mouse click
[11:24:14] <johnkpaul> using .trigger("click")
[11:24:20] <seltar> which test suite are you using
[11:24:30] <johnkpaul> I want to trigger a scroll, but pass it the extra parameters that specifiy what the scroll top and scroll left are
[11:24:31] <johnkpaul> qunit
[11:24:47] <seltar> qunit could probably do that.. stop the test running, wait for scroll to have finished, and then do the test
[11:25:01] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's what I'm doing now
[11:25:06] <johnkpaul> but the setup and tear down is really annoying
[11:25:06] <seltar> but i guess you have to add a setup and teardown function so you can mock up some content
[11:25:09] <seltar> heheh
[11:25:11] <johnkpaul> :)
[11:25:11] <johnkpaul> yeah
[11:25:13] <seltar> yeah :P
[11:25:30] <johnkpaul> maybe I just wish that jquery had a more functional itnerface
[11:25:34] <seltar> well, at least you're on the right track
[11:25:59] <seltar> functional how
[11:26:03] <johnkpaul> yeah, I can definitely get this working, I was just wondering if there was a libnrary to help me
[11:26:10] <johnkpaul> I'd wish that $(window).scroll()
[11:26:13] <johnkpaul> took two parameters
[11:26:16] <johnkpaul> scroll left and scroll top
[11:26:24] <seltar> jquery scrollTo should do that
[11:26:28] <johnkpaul> or something that I could get the scroll left and top
[11:26:35] <johnkpaul> yeah, but again, that's using the dom itself
[11:26:41] <seltar> $(window).prop("scrollTop")
[11:26:45] <seltar> should work
[11:26:45] <johnkpaul> if it were a more functional abstraction, my callback would get a parameter
[11:26:49] <johnkpaul> oh, really?
[11:26:55] <johnkpaul> even with no scrollbar?
[11:26:58] <johnkpaul> :D that would be awesome
[11:27:03] <seltar> hm.. don't know that actually
[11:27:32] <johnkpaul> :/ no
[11:27:43] <johnkpaul> but do you see what I mean, how I'd like my mocks to work?
[11:29:17] <seltar> i think so, but i'm not sure you can do it without a proper setup / teardown
[11:29:38] <juha-> could someone tell me how to open dev tools on safari?
[11:29:47] <seltar> right click and inspect element

[11:30:12] <johnkpaul> safari osx juha-? alt cmd C
[11:30:14] <soee> how can i get element by name, where name looks like this: somename[key][val] ?
[11:31:00] <seltar> $("[name='somename["+key+"]["+val+"]'")
[11:31:02] <seltar> or something
[11:31:37] <soee> seltar: key and vale arent dynamic
[11:32:53] <seltar> $("[name='somename[key][val]']")
[11:33:08] <johnkpaul> seltar: basically, I'd like something like this to work
[11:33:08] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/7MhB6/
[11:33:22] <johnkpaul> so that I can test my scroll handler completely separately from the DOM
[11:34:16] <seltar> can't you override the function?
[11:34:47] <johnkpaul> you mean override scrollLeft() in jQuery?
[11:43:15] <seltar> are there any backbone pro's in here?
[11:43:17] <juha-> thanks
[11:45:31] <johnkpaul> seltar: I know backbone fairly well, but #documentcloud will have much more help
[11:45:54] <seltar> ok, thanks :)

[12:33:05] <LukeNukem> the output is true, but jquery evaluates to false for some reason

[12:58:12] <poppiez> hi, I'm using easyXDM for a project. specifically Rpc. I want to be able to call a method on the provider from the consumer with a function callback that can fire multiple times. it seems like easyXDM deletes the callback upon firing the first time. anybody know why?
[12:59:55] <starsinmypockets> mind looking here? http://tmm.toomodernmedia.com/
[13:00:10] <starsinmypockets> Curious why the slider 'jumps'
[13:00:42] <smares> cheers guys
[13:00:59] <smares> according to the docu, .has() is faster than the selector on modern browsers
[13:01:33] <smares> but what can I use if I want to match elements that do not have a certain child?
[13:01:48] <smares> is this only possible via the :has() selector in combination with :not()?
[13:02:02] <seltar> starsinmypockets: because div.slides doesn't have a width the size of all the slides
[13:02:35] <starsinmypockets> seltar - is there a way to smooth it out?
[13:02:58] <seltar> set the width of the container to the number of slides multipled by the slide width
[13:03:07] <seltar> that's all you need
[13:03:19] <starsinmypockets> ok, just tweak the width.. thankyou
[13:03:24] <seltar> no prob
[13:08:19] <smares> let's say I have divs of class "price" that may or may not contain a del element
[13:08:32] <smares> if I want to select only those price divs that do not contain a del, what would be faster...
[13:08:55] <smares> $('.price').not($('.price').has('del'))
[13:09:12] <smares> or $('.price:not(has(del))')?
[13:09:25] <smares> (a colon is missing above)
[13:10:11] <seltar> benchmark it for us, and let us know :)
[13:10:20] <smares> meh :P
[13:10:24] <seltar> lol
[13:18:19] <smares> with 10 divs and 3 matches, $('.price').not($('.price').has('del')); is 60% faster than $('.price:not(:has(del))'); :)
[13:18:34] <smares> 7608 ops/s vs. 3059 ops/s
[13:18:44] <smares> tested with jsperf.com
[13:27:21] <razzi> smares what about caching $('.price') ?
[13:28:03] <razzi> $prices = $('.price'); $prices.not( $prices.has('del') );
[13:29:38] <Eviltwin> Why not $(".price:not(:has(del))")?
[13:29:53] <razzi> he said that was slower
[13:30:02] <zethalt> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-plugin-validation-date-picker-jquery-ui - im actually having the same problem as this guy using jquery validation + jquery ui datepicker, but i cant seem to get the fix posted to work.. unfortunately i am not able to post my code on jsfiddle at this time, but if anyone could break down the code in post #2 for me maybe it could help :)
[13:30:03] <Eviltwin> Oh pref
[13:30:07] <Eviltwin> perf*
[13:30:09] <smares> yep, cached is even faster
[13:30:20] <smares> 20%
[13:30:21] <ajpiano> $(".prices").not(":has(.del)") would probably be ideal
[13:30:31] <ajpiano> from a speed standpoint
[13:30:51] <smares> play around http://jsperf.com/not-has-vs-not-has
[13:31:00] <ajpiano> excellent
[13:31:20] <zethalt> oops nevermind, my next hit on google solved it
[13:32:25] <razzi> smaes .. and $('.price').not( $('.price del').parents('.price') ) ?
[13:32:33] <razzi> problaby not faster, but curious
[13:32:41] <razzi> smares*
[13:33:00] <vl4kn0> when I trigger focus event manually in ie9, it runs the callback function twice. works fine in other browsers, any workaround?
[13:33:39] <Eviltwin> vl4kn0: Can you make a (working) demo of your issue at jsfiddle.net?
[13:34:06] <vl4kn0> Eviltwin: will try
[13:35:02] <smares> razzi, almost as slow as via selectors
[13:35:18] <smares> 3871 ops/s vs. 3024 ops/s
[13:35:32] <smares> the cached approach reaches 9697 ops/s
[13:38:07] <ajpiano> just for reference, http://jsperf.com/not-has-vs-not-has/3
[13:38:15] <ajpiano> anyway, it's literally completely inconsequential which approach you take
[13:39:04] <ajpiano> i'd go with the one that reads best
[13:39:23] <guy> $('textarea[name="ay[description]"]').on('keyup onload', function(e){
[13:39:30] <guy> so what is the trigger for the "onload" of the elemnt?
[13:39:32] <guy> element*
[13:40:08] <xavier_d> Hi, trying to write a plugin with the setting containing a function that needs to reference the 'parent' object. if I'm using 'this' it references the settings object. How do I can reference the parent object? Minimal code: http://paste2.org/p/1936573
[13:40:32] <ajpiano> ?mdc call @ xavier_d
[13:40:33] <caniuse> ajpiano: call - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[13:40:34] <bot-t1> xavier_d, call - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[13:42:55] <vl4kn0> Eviltwin: this should do: http://jsfiddle.net/3djwe/
[13:44:24] <Eviltwin> And this is only happening in IE9?
[13:44:36] <Eviltwin> Have you tried it in other browsers?
[13:44:54] <vl4kn0> Eviltwin: I've tried opera, firefox and chrome, everything works fine
[13:45:26] <johnkpaul> is there a way to get a mock jquery object that has a particular offset
[13:45:38] <johnkpaul> $("<div></div>").css("left",100).offset() still has offset 0
[13:45:55] <Eviltwin> Try positioning it first?
[13:46:00] <Eviltwin> Adding it to the DOM somewhere?
[13:47:02] <Eviltwin> .css({"position": "absolute", "left": 100})
[13:47:07] <Eviltwin> .appendTo("body")
[13:47:17] <johnkpaul> ideally, I dont' want it in the dom, I just want it to return {left:100,top:0} when offset is called
[13:47:22] <johnkpaul> but let me try that anyway, thanks Eviltwin
[13:48:10] <johnkpaul> yeah, so if I append it to document.body, it all works as expected
[13:48:42] <johnkpaul> I wonder if there's a way to remove that though
[13:48:46] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: things that aren't in the dom don't have offset
[13:48:51] <Eviltwin> I mean...you could do something like var x = $("<div>"); x.offset = function() { return {left: 100, top: 0} };
[13:48:56] <johnkpaul> when I do $({scrollLeft:100).scrollLeft() I get 100
[13:49:08] <johnkpaul> yeah Eviltwin, that might be the way that I awnt to go
[13:49:16] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: yeah, I know, this is a mock in a unit test
[13:49:32] <johnkpaul> I was just wondering if there was a way to do the same thing that I can do with scrollLeft
[13:49:35] <Eviltwin> Well unit tests should have setup, then run, then teardown
[13:50:03] <Eviltwin> So you should be able to add it to the DOM, run the test, and then remove it
[13:50:10] <johnkpaul> yeah, but getting all of the setup done for something actually in the dom is annoying, and something that I am trying to avoid, but it is how I do it now
[13:50:25] <johnkpaul> since I found out that I could override scrollleft, it made my code significnatly cleanr
[13:50:30] <johnkpaul> so I was trying to do the same with offsets
[13:50:47] <vl4kn0> Eviltwin: my bad, it runs in chrome more than 10 times. not an issue in chrome or firefox
[13:58:13] <defendguin> i'm having an issue where jqm isn't switching to the page after it has been gotten.  my web server says the request for the page completed but the phone never changes pages
[14:07:54] <Whirl3d> does anyone have a (inset list of expletives) reasonable explanation of css div positioning. I can't figure this out to save my life. I have literally been struggling for two days to make the simplest layout and css if so fucked, I can't believe it.
[14:10:31] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: #css might be able to help better than here, but "div positioning" means a lot of different things in context
[14:10:32] <Whirl3d> nvm, I just quit my job. CSS is going to be the death of me. Thanks anyways--life is too short.
[14:10:37] <LukeNukem> does anyone here use jquery UI?
[14:10:46] <Whirl3d> and if you have ever been to #css you know better.
[14:10:53] <Whirl3d> but thanks for the reply.
[14:21:58] <thesolidsnake> Hello everyone :)
[14:23:28] <thesolidsnake> Can someone help me , i do not know whats the best way to implement this :P
[14:25:51] <thesolidsnake> Basically i have this - http://oi44.tinypic.com/dr4ili.jpg   . Whats the best/easiest way to implement jquery ui draggable fuction , so that only the tiles next to the white square can be dragged onto the white scare
[14:25:55] <thesolidsnake> square*
[14:26:08] <johnkpaul> thesolidsnake: do you have any code?
[14:26:35] <johnkpaul> thesolidsnake: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#event-start
[14:27:33] <thesolidsnake> I can get the tiles draggable but what should I do. How would I make it so only the tiles next to the white square are draggable
[14:27:53] <thesolidsnake> DO I have to find out the white tiles position and then do lots of stuff like that
[14:28:35] <johnkpaul> no, I am pretty sure that you can return false from dragstart
[14:28:44] <johnkpaul> to start the drag before it starts
[14:28:49] <johnkpaul> to stop* the drag before it starts
[14:30:02] <Blaster> if you append a paragraph to an element, and appending the paragraph makes the element taller, is there a way to animate that increase in height?
[14:31:10] <thesolidsnake> hmm, but like in this picture -  http://oi44.tinypic.com/dr4ili.jpg  . Only the squares labelled A , B and C can be dragged to the white square, The rest of them can't be dragged. So how would I start this code? I don't know how to go about it. Not the code just how would I implement this
[14:32:02] <thesolidsnake> How can square F tell that its not next to the white square and therefore won't be draggable
[14:34:14] <razzi> blaster, probably there is an easy way but ... some tedious way that comes to mind is : 1. clone parent element 2. set clone invisible and add to dom 3. get height of clone 4. set height and overflow to hidden to original parent element 5. add paragraph 6. animate height of parent 7. remove clone
[14:34:57] <thesolidsnake> Why can I not do a simple thing and just have it so the squares are constrained by the other squares and then problem solved
[14:35:50] <Blaster> is this the best way to append a paragraph tag?  $(elem).append('<p></p>');   Is there a similar function where I can just provide 'p' as an argument or something?
[14:36:33] <razzi> why don't you like that?
[14:36:58] <Blaster> im not sure I just envisioned something like $(elem).append('p') to be cleaner
[14:38:14] <thesolidsnake> AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[14:39:08] <mbuttu> Blaster: you can do append("<p/>")
[14:39:22] <dilvie> mbuttu: you don't even need the /
[14:39:28] <dilvie> the closing </p> is implied.
[14:40:00] <mbuttu> dilvie: nice that's good to know
[14:40:27] <dilvie> and, fyi, <p/> is invalid html5
[14:40:29] <Blaster> in this chain $('.userRegisterForm').slideUp('slow').append('<p class="successMsg"></p>').hide().text(registerSuccessMessage).slideDown();     Would everything after the append affect the appended element or the original?
[14:41:11] <dilvie> self closing tags are only valid for things like <br /> that are always empty.
[14:41:52] <dilvie> Blaster: the original.
[14:42:15] <mbuttu> I have been struggling with getting the draggable widget to work with multiple elements at the same time. Seems like there is infinite recursion http://jsfiddle.net/mbuttu/gaeet/1/
[14:42:49] <Blaster> dilvie:  Would it be worthwhile to add a filter or something so I can use that chain?  Im trying to do the hide() and the text() and the slideDown() on the newly created <p>
[14:42:58] <dilvie> Blaster: .userRegisterForm becomes "this" in those methods, and only methods that return a new collection (such as .filter, .find, etc..) will alter the context of the next method in the chain.
[14:44:01] <dilvie> Blaster, well, you could add .find('.slideDown').hide().text(...
[14:44:03] <ajpiano> Blaster:  just do $("<p>").appendTo(".userRegisterForm").text("whatever").slideDown()
[14:44:16] <ajpiano> then the newly created element is what you're working on the whole time
[14:44:23] <dilvie> the cleaner solution is what ajpiano said
[14:44:27] <Blaster> nice didnt know you could
[14:46:06] <vl4kn0> okej, i'll ask again because i'm lost. how do I prevent focus from triggering multiple times in ie9? one callback is with 'isTrigger' attribute and the second is without, so it calls the callback on both, manual trigger and on the real trigger again
[14:46:19] <dilvie> Blaster: it's kindof awkward to change the meaning of "this" in the middle of a chain. It makes your code hard to read.
[14:48:35] <Blaster> agree
[14:50:23] <Blaster> $('.userRegisterForm').slideUp(function() {$('<p>').appendTo('.authFormWrapper').hide().text(registerSuccessMsg).slideDown(1000);},1000);
[14:50:35] <Blaster> For some reason when I added those slide times, it stopped working completely
[14:51:38] <Blaster> They look like they are in the right place though
[14:51:41] <Blaster> Any idea?
[14:52:06] <Blaster> nvm I think duration might come before callback
[14:57:21] <thesolidsnake> Ok If I drag a div on top of another div. How do I make the location of the dragged div turn into the div I dragged the div to. Basically swap places?
[14:57:54] <Eviltwin> Have you looked at jQuery UI draggable?
[14:59:11] <thesolidsnake> yep
[14:59:19] <thesolidsnake> its complicated
[14:59:43] <thesolidsnake> This stuff is harder than c#
[15:01:18] <diegoviola> hi
[15:01:54] <diegoviola> i have a slider div that uses the jquery cycle plugin to rotate images, it uses position relative and z-index 1-4, is there a way to add another div that overlaps the slider without using position absolute?
[15:02:14] <diegoviola> the thing is, i want to have a em-based layout and i don't want the caption div (div that overlaps slider) to move left and right when i resize the fonts
[15:02:18] <diegoviola> on my layout
[15:02:23] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[15:12:34] <DeLorean719> I'm accessing a .json file using jsonp, when I retrieve the json text, it comes back as [object Object,[object Object]... what is this telling me? (posting code now)
[15:13:25] <DeLorean719> http://pastebin.com/7KJCrHvu
[15:14:13] <johnkpaul> DeLorean719: try document.write(JSON.stringify(data))
[15:17:21] <DeLorean719> awesome
[15:17:25] <DeLorean719> that printed out what I expected
[15:17:34] <DeLorean719> very helpful
[15:17:58] <DeLorean719> assuming the data returned is this: [{"id":"4f340c0fccaa102d3104c898","offline_pool_id":"4f340bdf21fd40030d04d52f"...
[15:18:04] <DeLorean719> shouldnt data.id return that id string?
[15:21:01] <thesolidsnake> how do i call the dragend function
[15:22:10] <diegoviola> is there a way to slide images without the use of position and z-index?
[15:22:34] <Eviltwin> Depends
[15:22:52] <johnkpaul> DeLorean719: jquery converts the string tinto a json object for you
[15:23:17] <diegoviola> thing is, my layout screws up if i have to use position absolute for a caption/slider
[15:23:32] <diegoviola> for caption, etc
[15:23:44] <diegoviola> when i resize the page
[15:23:46] <DeLorean719> johnkpaul: Right, I thought I'd be able to do data.id to get that id string since it's a json object... what am I misunderstanding?
[15:24:05] <johnkpaul> data is an array in that case
[15:24:08] <johnkpaul> data[0].id
[15:24:15] <johnkpaul> would be what you're looking for
[15:24:28] <johnkpaul> thesolidsnake: you don't call dragend, the jquery ui framework does for you
[15:24:37] <johnkpaul> you need to add a handler for that event
[15:24:54] <johnkpaul> diegoviola: do you have an live example somwehere?
[15:25:35] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: yes, http://pip.com.py/
[15:25:55] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: zoom in/out the page and note how that white box moves to left/right
[15:26:22] <diegoviola> the slide_caption div
[15:26:42] <DeLorean719> johnkpaul: ty!!! (:
[15:27:17] <defendguin> anyone here with JQM experience?  i've got a remote page trying to load the DOM is updated with the content the page before change event fires but it stops there
[15:30:05] <defendguin> no failed events are triggered
[15:31:09] <thesolidsnake> johnkpaul if i start draggin a div then it calls this function and if certain conditions are meant then I want it to stop dragging. So I can I tell it to end dragging , even if the user hasnt released click ?
[15:35:27] <johnkpaul> thesolidsnake: the idea is to not let it start dragging at all
[15:35:33] <johnkpaul> or, when the drag is over, you can move it back
[15:35:58] <johnkpaul> diegoviola: how do I zoom in?
[15:36:04] <johnkpaul> you mean control +?
[15:37:19] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: ctrl -/+ in firefox
[15:37:21] <diegoviola> yes
[15:38:08] <johnkpaul> and you want that to stay in the same location relative to slider?
[15:38:42] <diegoviola> yes
[15:40:02] <johnkpaul> put it inside the slider div
[15:40:06] <johnkpaul> add position absolute
[15:40:27] <johnkpaul> and bottom:-30px;right:-30px
[15:41:05] <thesolidsnake> Right someone look at this code please = http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/2/
[15:41:08] <thesolidsnake> whats wrong ?
[15:42:12] <thesolidsnake> something like that, so the bits that have Move left , move right etc, are draggable otherwise the tile is not draggable
[15:43:27] <johnkpaul> thesolidsnake: I thnk you're forgetting about droppables
[15:43:32] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: that doesn't work here :/
[15:43:43] <johnkpaul> oh, why not?
[15:44:04] <thesolidsnake> I dont need to set a droppable, my items can drop without a droppable
[15:44:26] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: not sure, i don't see the div anymore
[15:46:08] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: i think the slider plugin is setting display to none, that's why
[15:54:52] <starsinmypockets> Hello - I'm building a simple content slider... tmm.toomodernmedia.com How can I get the .slide divs to recycle themselves so that the next prev buttons show the  first/last divs when they run out of slides?
[15:55:03] <starsinmypockets> http://tmm.toomodernmedia.com
[15:57:16] <dwarder> hello, why minus button doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/92J25/ ?
[15:57:17] <dwarder> i.e. it works as a plus
[15:58:00] <DeLorean719> How can I get this data to refresh without refreshing the page?
[15:58:00] <DeLorean719> http://pastebin.com/u7AGSPSg
[16:01:00] <v_y> anyone know of a lightbox lib that does nothing but lightbox a given element?
[16:01:10] <v_y> all the others i've looked at expect a sequence of images
[16:01:17] <v_y> to act as a gallery
[16:05:45] <Ziggy> DeLorean719: Hmm? http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/
[16:06:19] <thesolidsnake> How can this code not work
[16:06:21] <thesolidsnake> $('.square').mousedown(function() {
[16:06:21] <thesolidsnake>   $(this).append('Mouse down');
[16:06:21] <thesolidsnake> });
[16:06:39] <thesolidsnake> when i click a div thats class .square nothing happens
[16:07:14] <Ziggy> DeLorean719: Looks valid to me, like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/3/
[16:07:50] <Ziggy> Just change the url to your jsonp url, and work with the data.
[16:09:24] <Ziggy> DeLorean719: The "data" property is used to send parameters by the way..
[16:15:32] <defendguin> does the ajaxForm method still exist?  i thought i remembered it but i can't find it on the site anymore
[16:37:46] <DeLorean719> Ziggy: thanks for the reply... but the data doesn't automatically change still, it only changes when I click "Use JSONP". How do I pull the updated jsonp every... say 5 seconds?
[16:44:55] <seltar> DeLorean719: setInterval or setTimeout in javascript can help you there
[16:45:24] <DeLorean719> but which function would I call once the timeout has gone down?
[16:45:38] <seltar> whatever function is run when you click Use JSONP
[16:45:44] <DeLorean719> I tried a few things, I guess the jquery notation is confusing me
[16:45:48] <seltar> sorry, i just jumped in, and answered the last question :P
[16:45:59] <DeLorean719> haha no, it's much appreciated
[16:45:59] <starsinmypockets> anyone mind looking at this carousel.. trying to get infinite loop using .before http://tmm.toomodernmedia.com the js is in index.html
[16:46:16] <DeLorean719> I mean I was doing something lke this: var refreshInterval = setInterval($.ajax, 5 * 1000);
[16:47:43] <seltar> starsinmypockets: set the width of the container wider ( to fit the new copies ), and use .append() / .prepend() ( that will move the element from it's current position )
[16:48:49] <seltar> DeLorean719: more something like this: var refreshInterval = setInterval( function(){ $.getJSON("url", data, function(data){}); }, 5 * 1000);
[16:49:01] <starsinmypockets> seltar, I'm not sure how to calculate the container width since the slides are added dynamically...
[16:49:21] <starsinmypockets> and do you mean to use .append() .prepend() instead of .before() .after()?
[16:49:54] <seltar> well, either one i guess
[16:50:53] <seltar> you could also use .clone()
[16:51:27] <seltar> but yeah, off to bed! nite
[16:52:12] <DeLorean719> thanks seltar
[16:53:20] <DeLorean719> meh that's still not working for me
[17:21:50] <mbuttu> has anyone got the draggable widget to work with multiple elements at the same time?
[17:42:43] <eddiemonge> at the same time or on the same page?
[17:44:57] <DeLorean719> talking to me?
[17:45:39] <jcp_> using jquery ui autocomplete and it's returning  an array of objects… how do i remove the objects from the array so i can use dot notation to access their properties
[18:01:17] <no-gooder> hey guys
[18:02:05] <no-gooder> i'm trying to select(hover) li tag dynamicly : $("#searchlinks li:nth-child( 3 )").append("<span> - 2nd!</span>");
[18:02:34] <iLogic> no-gooder: try live()
[18:02:44] <no-gooder> if i pass some number it works. but  $("#searchlinks li:nth-child( varaible)").append("<span> - 2nd!</span>");   doesn't work.
[18:03:13] <no-gooder> <iLogic> would you send me some example, please.
[18:03:15] <iLogic> no-gooder: you have to take variable out of the quotes
[18:03:58] <Es0teric> who here has used twitter bootstrap?
[18:04:00] <iLogic> something like $('#searchlinks li:nth-child'+variable+').append....
[18:04:34] <iLogic> no-gooder: I mistyped it, but did you get it?
[18:05:03] <no-gooder> <iLogic> yes, i get it.thank you. i'm trying..
[18:05:09] <iLogic> no-gooder: np
[18:05:19] <Es0teric> how do i set the tooltip animation for twitter bootstrap?
[18:05:41] <Es0teric> because $(''.div').tooltip('animation', 'true'); isnt working
[18:05:59] <Es0teric> and $('.div').tooltip({animation: 'true'}); isnt working either
[18:06:34] <iLogic> Es0teric: usually booleans don't go inside quotes, that's for strings
[18:07:38] <Es0teric> iLogic, if i take true off quotes
[18:07:44] <Es0teric> theres still no fade in/out
[18:07:48] <Es0teric> of the tooltip
[18:11:59] <iLogic> Es0teric: lmgtfy
[18:12:02] <iLogic> Es0teric: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9446318/bootstrap-tooltips-not-working
[18:12:22] <Es0teric> iLogic i never said the tooltip wasnt working… i said it wasnt fading in and out
[18:12:34] <iLogic> actually
[18:12:41] <iLogic> you did say it wasn't working
[18:12:48] <iLogic> that's exactly what you said
[18:12:59] <Es0teric> well then let me clarify
[18:13:01] <Es0teric> the tooltip is working
[18:13:03] <iLogic> no need
[18:13:05] <Es0teric> its just not fading in and out
[18:13:13] <iLogic> I did get it, just rebuffing because I didn't like your tone
[18:13:52] <Es0teric> -_-
[18:13:52] <iLogic> well, good luck with that :)
[18:19:37] <]Darker[> hi hguys

[18:20:39] <]Darker[> i tried jquery mobile and swipe.js but both conflict with other libraries I am using
[18:20:42] <]Darker[> any suggestion?
[18:21:23] <iLogic> ]Darker[: I use touchwipe
[18:21:28] <iLogic> have you tried it?
[18:21:43] <]Darker[> no, I will take a look thanks!! :)
[18:21:46] <iLogic> http://www.netcu.de/jquery-touchwipe-iphone-ipad-library
[18:21:50] <iLogic> np
[18:22:03] <iLogic> it seems to crash safari mobile with large images
[18:22:12] <iLogic> but otherwise it works fine here
[18:26:32] <]Darker[> auh
[18:26:37] <]Darker[> large images = ?
[18:26:52] <]Darker[> cause I am swiping 1040px x 760px images
[18:26:58] <]Darker[> I will test tomorrow
[18:27:04] <]Darker[> anyway
[18:27:23] <]Darker[> ftm it seems that it works great, thank you very much :)
[18:27:27] <iLogic> yes, you better try it yourself.. cause there a lot of other heavy stuff going on my site (like panning animations) that may cause it
[18:27:43] <iLogic> np :)
[18:27:57] <]Darker[> do u have experience developing website for ipad / iphone?
[18:28:06] <iLogic> yup
[18:28:36] <]Darker[> cause I have a weird problem: honestly I changed a lot of code and I dunno if it happens again, I will know tomorrow
[18:28:57] <iLogic> heheh I'm here all week
[18:28:57] <]Darker[> basically on my site i wish that on screen resize / rotate the page is reloaded
[18:29:14] <]Darker[> so I added a stupid .onResize()
[18:29:20] <iLogic> you can do that with css
[18:29:47] <]Darker[> yes, but i really need that the js is reloaded
[18:29:55] <iLogic> uhm
[18:30:05] <]Darker[> because I am calculating windows size int hat
[18:30:15] <]Darker[> anyway, it works flawless with everything
[18:30:20] <]Darker[> i tried with Ipad
[18:30:29] <]Darker[> and it cause an infinite refresh
[18:30:30] <]Darker[> :\
[18:30:54] <]Darker[> today I realized that I haven't added it in document.ready()
[18:31:01] <]Darker[> and possibly it's the cause of the problem
[18:31:12] <]Darker[> but... you know, just for the sake of conversation
[18:31:23] <iLogic> why calculate it every time?
[18:31:35] <]Darker[> do you know any issue about reload() on ipad / iphone
[18:31:44] <]Darker[> because I need a fullsize slideshow
[18:31:56] <]Darker[> fullscreen
[18:31:57] <]Darker[> *
[18:32:48] <iLogic> you could like window.onorientationchange = function() { if (window.orientation === 0) { //portation-mode-size } else if (orientation === 90) { //landscape to the left } else if (orientation === -90) { //landscape to the right }
[18:32:55] <iLogic> sorry, got a little carried away there
[18:34:01] <]Darker[> that's fine thanks
[18:34:05] <]Darker[> :)
[18:34:08] <]Darker[> but, you know
[18:34:10] <iLogic> it works fine here, never had an issue
[18:34:22] <]Darker[> i really wish that, if tou resize the brower
[18:34:37] <]Darker[> it follows the same behaviour
[18:34:49] <iLogic> I don't get it
[18:34:56] <iLogic> how do you resize a mobile browser?
[18:35:06] <]Darker[> it's not just a mobile site
[18:35:11] <]Darker[> it's a stadard website
[18:35:13] <]Darker[> n
[18:35:23] <iLogic> you gotta pick your weapons
[18:35:32] <]Darker[> if you open with a mobile, u will have the cool swipe
[18:35:43] <]Darker[> if you rotate -> refresh
[18:36:02] <]Darker[> if you resize the browser (stanard web) -> refresh
[18:36:30] <iLogic> you should separate the two sites
[18:36:40] <iLogic> make a mobile version like m.site.com
[18:36:49] <]Darker[> eh, it definetively is a good idea
[18:36:52] <iLogic> and write a totally different script for each
[18:37:27] <]Darker[> well, thanks for all the tips :)
[18:37:36] <iLogic> np :)
[18:37:36] <]Darker[> I will take a nap now, it's 2 in the morning!!

[18:50:50] <mbuttu> eddiemonge: dragging multiple elements at the same time
[18:53:52] <oojacoboo> can I store a $.load() in a var?
[19:00:46] <starsinmypockets> Can anyone help to explain why my .before() function isn't working... http://tmm.toomodernmedia.com
[19:00:53] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to get infinite loop caurosel
[19:01:21] <oojacoboo> starsinmypockets: where is the code
[19:01:25] <oojacoboo> don't make peopel search
[19:01:32] <starsinmypockets> sorry in index.html
[19:01:38] <oojacoboo> not helpful
[19:01:49] <starsinmypockets> in the head tag
[19:02:46] <oojacoboo> I don't see it, I only see your tmm.js
[19:02:57] <oojacoboo> oh sorry
[19:03:00] <oojacoboo> I see it inline
[19:03:37] <oojacoboo> starsinmypockets: that doesnt' make sense
[19:03:41] <oojacoboo> there isn't an event
[19:04:30] <starsinmypockets> hmm.. well, if it's the first .slide div I want the previous div to be the last .slide div, etc...
[19:04:52] <oojacoboo> starsinmypockets: do something like… if(element:last-child) back to :first-child
[19:10:21] <iLogic> oojacoboo: success : function (data) { loadvar = data } ?
[19:10:39] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:10:42] <oojacoboo> that's what I did instead
[19:11:02] <oojacoboo> I was somehow hoping I could use var foo = $.load()
[19:11:34] <iLogic> well, you could do foo = $.functionThatGetsLoad
[19:11:50] <oojacoboo> no need too much overhead
[19:11:53] <iLogic> but that's the same :)
[19:11:54] <oojacoboo> thanks for the input though
[19:12:27] <iLogic> or make it in a function
[19:12:55] <oojacoboo> $.get().success(fucntion(data){});
[19:12:57] <oojacoboo> that's all I needed
[19:12:57] <iLogic> function get (a) { var = $.ajax({
[19:13:03] <iLogic> yeah
[19:13:07] <iLogic> that too :)
[19:13:14] <oojacoboo> I was just hoping to use load to a var
[19:13:22] <oojacoboo> but no big deal
[19:19:57] <miket3> when posting a textarea how can i keep the carriage returns in the post?
[19:20:30] <tw2113> *burp*
[19:20:33] <tw2113> excuse me
[19:22:16] <oojacoboo> miket3: how are you getting/posting
[19:22:30] <oojacoboo> getting the data from the DOM and post-ing to the server that is
[19:22:35] <eddiemonge> miket3: to make the textbox bigger or to send them to the backend?
[19:22:45] <oojacoboo> are you just serializing and posting?
[19:24:03] <eddiemonge> ok then
[19:24:07] <miket3> i am submitting 1 textarea to backend via post
[19:24:23] <oojacoboo> apparently you don't answer questions very well
[19:24:31] <oojacoboo> I asked specific questions
[19:24:42] <oojacoboo> not just repeat what you said the first time
[19:25:44] <miket3> i have a form with a textarea.   I enter text with cariage returns.  then hit submit button to submit to my php method
[19:26:03] <oojacoboo> I'm finished trying to help
[19:26:58] <eddiemonge> so its a normal form, no javascript at all?
[19:27:07] <miket3> corect
[19:27:18] <oojacoboo> then WHY  are you asking in jquery?!
[19:27:45] <DeLorean719> Can anyone tell me why this isn't updating continuously? http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/10/
[19:28:20] <DeLorean719> I had to change my auth_token for public views, but it does pull the data the first time... then fails to update even though I think I have the refreshInterval written properly
[19:28:40] <miket3> do i need to use js to replace the \r and \s with something like ~
[19:28:55] <oojacoboo> miket3: no
[19:29:01] <oojacoboo> you need to parse it correctly on the php side
[19:29:10] <eddiemonge> miket3: your form should be submitting the carriage returns then. are you sure you arent handling them correctly on the backend?
[19:29:13] <miket3> i really dont care about the returns other than to parse th estring
[19:29:33] <oojacoboo> miket3: ##php
[19:30:41] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: where are you calling refreshInterval at?
[19:31:03] <miket3> eddiemonge, I created my parsing code from a mysql field for development purposes. now i want to run the code from and html textarea and it fails to parse the textarea
[19:31:27] <eddiemonge> miket3: you are asking in the wrong channel
[19:31:29] <DeLorean719> eddiemonge: maybe that's the problem... how/where would I? I'm really newb if you couldn't tell lol
[19:31:41] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: refreshInterval()
[19:32:28] <DeLorean719> that's really counterintuitive to me... refreshInterval() implies it's a function
[19:32:34] <DeLorean719> but I set it like it's a variable
[19:33:37] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: exactly. you set it as a variable but never call it as a function. why did you set it as a variable?
[19:34:25] <aqeel> hi room
[19:35:39] <DeLorean719> eddiemonge: I dunno, I'm a confused little monkey. Can you show me how I should do it?
[19:35:51] <aqeel> ???
[19:36:38] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: i did
[19:38:25] <DeLorean719> I mean in jsfiddle
[19:38:42] <eddiemonge> just call the function with ()
[19:39:08] <DeLorean719> well, I did that and it's not refreshing still
[19:39:18] <DeLorean719> sorry to be so persistent... it's making me feel like an idiot
[19:40:47] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: its these times when my advice to first learn JavaScript basics comes in handy
[19:45:05] <DeLorean719> eddiemonge: basic javascript isn't the problem, I feel I could write it in plain javascript. It's the jquery notation that confuses me
[19:46:36] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: calling a function is plain JavaScript
[19:47:37] <DeLorean719> are you looking at my code?
[19:48:10] <eddiemonge> im looking at the function that holds the interval and how its never called
[19:48:56] <DeLorean719> how do I call refreshInterval if it is not a function
[19:49:32] <eddiemonge> i already said, refreshInterval()
[19:50:02] <DeLorean719> and I already said that I did that and it's not refreshing
[19:51:08] <eddiemonge> is the function being called? is the ajax request being made?
[19:51:45] <DeLorean719> it works when I click the button, which makes sense
[19:51:51] <DeLorean719> but not when I invoke refreshInterval
[19:51:52] <DeLorean719> via the timer
[19:52:06] <eddiemonge> new code
[19:52:53] <DeLorean719> not sure what you mean...
[19:53:19] <eddiemonge> whats your code look like now?
[19:53:27] <DeLorean719> oh I see
[19:53:44] <DeLorean719> http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/21/
[19:56:28] <eddiemonge> why do you need refreshInterval as a variable?
[19:57:02] <DeLorean719> I don't, that's what someone else showed me as an example
[19:58:09] <DeLorean719> but when I make it in to a fuction like so (http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/24/)
[19:58:12] <DeLorean719> I get no data back at all
[19:59:05] <eddiemonge> why do you need it as a function?
[19:59:26] <DeLorean719> how would you propose to do it?
[19:59:27] <DeLorean719> link me
[20:00:08] <eddiemonge> im just trying to find out why you are writing code that you dont know what its doing instead of doing it the simple way
[20:01:23] <DeLorean719> well that makes sense
[20:01:30] <DeLorean719> because setInterval is its own function
[20:01:40] <DeLorean719> so I don't need it inside another function
[20:01:59] <eddiemonge> do you know the downsides to setInterval? do you know how it works?
[20:02:09] <DeLorean719> no
[20:02:24] <DeLorean719> but I'll read about better methods after I can get this to refresh
[20:02:25] <DeLorean719> that's the main goal
[20:02:28] <DeLorean719> http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/27/
[20:02:40] <DeLorean719> so that's simplified now
[20:02:49] <eddiemonge> so you are just writing and using code that you dont know what it does?
[20:03:39] <DeLorean719> sure, call it tinkering
[20:03:47] <DeLorean719> I know it is able to achieve what I want
[20:04:04] <DeLorean719> I don't know if it's the best at it
[20:04:36] <DeLorean719> did you see the new version?
[20:04:37] <DeLorean719> 27?
[20:04:47] <eddiemonge> if you are just tinkering then use the simplest possible approach http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/28/
[20:05:58] <DeLorean719> hm
[20:06:02] <DeLorean719> so it pulls the data when I click again
[20:06:05] <DeLorean719> then never refreshes
[20:06:11] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/31/
[20:06:54] <eddiemonge> sorry typo http://jsfiddle.net/e7AQV/33/
[20:07:11] <DeLorean719> i didn't find it before you sent the new link lol
[20:07:12] <DeLorean719> was trying
[20:08:20] <DeLorean719> wow
[20:08:21] <DeLorean719> it works
[20:08:24] <DeLorean719> you're the man, thank you
[20:09:00] <eddiemonge> its what comes of knowing the basics and correctly using them. again, thats why i advocate learning the basics first
[20:36:14] <SuperRoach|> Afternoon all :)
[20:36:45] <Es0teric> who here is good with twitter bootstrap?
[20:39:10] <didxga_> hi, all :)
[20:39:45] <didxga_> I came up two solution for a particular problem, anyone can help me judge which one is better?
[20:39:56] <didxga_> the problem I solved is like this, initially, a [input] was disable, it is enabled only when user click on the area occupied by the input field.
[20:40:12] <didxga_> the two solutions: http://jsfiddle.net/didxga/6Kck7/4/
[20:40:16] <didxga_> http://jsfiddle.net/didxga/LG5XW/
[20:41:02] <didxga_> can someone kindly help with this
[20:42:29] <tw2113> ?wait tw2113
[20:42:30] <bot-t1> tw2113, Couldn't find "wait tw2113" in jQuery Docs.
[20:42:34] <tw2113> oops
[20:42:37] <tw2113> ?wait
[20:42:37] <bot-t1> tw2113, Cookbook/wait - http://docs.jquery.com/Cookbook/wait
[20:43:32] <Es0teric> tw2113, i am trying to pull in a container from another page into a modal window while making tooltips work… how would you do that?
[20:43:52] <Es0teric> i tried doing .load('page/url/here #container');
[20:44:01] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:44:19] <Es0teric> -_-
[20:44:29] <tw2113> i know less about js than i do wp
[20:44:43] <Es0teric> lol i see..
[20:45:59] <SuperRoach|> Es0teric, do you have a jsfiddle sample?
[20:46:29] <Es0teric> SuperRoach| how do i do a jsfiddle of an ajax request
[20:46:34] <Es0teric> for the modal from bootstrap?
[20:46:49] <SuperRoach|> ah i see your point
[20:47:05] <SuperRoach|> i thought you had a response you could have replaced for the demo
[20:47:39] <SuperRoach|> I've loaded the result of an remote call before into a model window
[20:47:44] <SuperRoach|> thats probabl not what your after though
[20:47:45] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: what is wrong with that code? what are you calling .load on?
[20:49:08] <Es0teric> eddiemonge well basically i have a homepage and a contact page right? i have a container wrapping the contact form and on the homepage i have a link for contact, i am calling .load() on that contact link, then loading it onto the #wrap inside the homepage
[20:50:29] <Es0teric> also, eddiemonge & SuperRoach| none of the js i made for the contact form works inside the modal… the backdrop doesnt occur in the modal AND the close doesnt close out the modal.. so none of the works inside the modal
[20:50:35] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: i mean what is not working exacly? demo code is helpful
[20:51:12] <SuperRoach|> yeah
[20:51:38] <Es0teric> eddiemonge the modal triggers on the homepage.. and the content inside shows BUT none of the js for the content works inside the modal, and the backdrop doesnt occur on the modal
[20:52:07] <Es0teric> the backdrop would be the black overlay
[20:52:10] <Es0teric> behind it
[20:52:23] <Es0teric> also the close button doesnt close out the modal
[20:52:31] <Es0teric> neither does clicking outside the modal
[20:52:47] <eddiemonge> so bootstrap isnt working then?
[20:52:52] <eddiemonge> sounds about right
[20:53:07] <Es0teric> it works to the extent that the .load() is calling the content and displaying it
[20:53:16] <Es0teric> but it doesnt work past that
[20:53:41] <eddiemonge> maybe you need some delegation
[20:53:48] <eddiemonge> ? on delegation @ Es0teric
[20:53:48] <bot-t1> Es0teric, The new .on() method supports delegated events as well. Read up on it at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[20:55:21] <Es0teric> hmmm...
[20:56:03] <Es0teric> eddiemonge when the modal is called… even if the content is on another page, would it retrieve it?
[20:57:20] <eddiemonge> if its retrieved correctly
[20:57:36] <Es0teric> as in?
[20:57:37] <Linex_> I have a click function and inside the click function I do $("#divTeam").dialog("open");. I want to pass a variable to this dialog that I open. How ?
[20:58:02] <ccmonster_> hey guys, trying to turn a json array into a ul/li for a 'leaderboard' and i was curious what the best method was to translate the data into the elements : http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/zM5QQ/1/
[20:58:57] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: as in do it correctly and it will
[20:59:06] <eddiemonge> Linex_: what kind of variable? for what?
[20:59:21] <Es0teric> eddiemonge you see.. i am doing this $('#idofanchorforcontact').on('click', function() { $('.modal').modal('toggle');  });
[21:00:08] <Es0teric> eddiemonge $('#idofanchorforcontact').on('click', function() { $('.modal').modal('toggle'); return false; }); ***
[21:00:11] <ccmonster_> is map better than each to iterate through my json?
[21:00:12] <Linex_> eddiemonge: just a number e.g 1 or 2 or 3 . Then, in the dialog, depending on that variable, I do different things.
[21:00:20] <cincinnatus> jQuery UI seems a bit dead... Big plans, no releases...
[21:00:28] <eddiemonge> ccmonster_: im assuming you are getting the json from an ajax request right?
[21:00:37] <cincinnatus> Is there a popular alternative without a restrictive license?
[21:00:52] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Es0teric
[21:00:52] <cincinnatus> (i.e. free for commercial use)
[21:00:53] <bot-t1> Es0teric, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:01:03] <eddiemonge> cincinnatus: not dead at all
[21:01:06] <eddiemonge> not even close
[21:01:07] <Linex_> eddiemonge: I think it is difficult to explain. Can I query you so that I can paste some things to the screen.
[21:01:18] <eddiemonge> cincinnatus: have you looked at all the stuff being done in git?
[21:01:25] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Linex_
[21:01:26] <bot-t1> Linex_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:01:45] <ccmonster_> yea eddiemonge
[21:01:59] <ccmonster_> i just have the format there for testing purposes
[21:02:04] <Es0teric> eddiemonge how am i going to create a demo of a modal window that will retrieve data from two diff pages?
[21:02:37] <Linex_> eddiemonge: I can't. its inside a firewall and no portforrward.
[21:03:02] <Linex_> eddiemonge: just have a look when I paste. If its gibberish, forget about it.
[21:03:15] <eddiemonge> ccmonster_: whats wrong with a for loop to construct the html then append it?
[21:03:24] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: you dont need to. code is fine
[21:03:37] <Es0teric> ok eddiemonge.. give me a minute
[21:04:13] <ccmonster_> i dont think anything is wrong with that eddiemonge , just thinking mapping it might be better
[21:04:44] <ccmonster_> and are you referring to a for loop as oppose to the each?
[21:04:47] <eddiemonge> ccmonster_: if you say so
[21:04:57] <eddiemonge> yes, people use each when its not necessary
[21:05:05] <eddiemonge> for loops are a lot faster
[21:05:11] <ccmonster_> yes. they certainly are
[21:09:09] <cincinnatus> eddiemonge: There hasn't been a non-bugfix release since 2010.
[21:09:25] <cincinnatus> eddiemonge: Also, I don't seen a lot of 3d party plugins built as widgets
[21:10:50] <eddiemonge> because they arent really needed
[21:10:55] <eddiemonge> cincinnatus: are you just trolling?
[21:11:48] <westg> is John Resig still active with jQuery development?
[21:14:40] <eddiemonge> westg: yes
[21:15:42] <DeLorean719> eddiemonge: could you point me in the right direction for finding out how to get the value for keys when something is "stringified"
[21:15:48] <Es0teric> eddiemonge -> http://jsfiddle.net/LrPHs/1/
[21:15:51] <Es0teric> thats a rough example
[21:15:56] <DeLorean719> e.g. when it's in this form: [{"key":"value"}]
[21:16:07] <Eviltwin> ?
[21:16:23] <Eviltwin> JSON.parse
[21:16:25] <Eviltwin> ?
[21:16:40] <DeLorean719> thanks
[21:16:44] <Es0teric> eddiemonge -> http://jsfiddle.net/LrPHs/1/show/
[21:16:46] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: why is it stringified?
[21:18:00] <DeLorean719> because if I don't stringify it, the data comes back as "[object Object],[object Object]"
[21:18:04] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: i feel you are missing something and asking for help in the wrong place
[21:18:16] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: data baack from where?
[21:18:42] <DeLorean719> remote domain via jsonp
[21:19:56] <eddiemonge> ok then the data coming back should be in JSON format already
[21:20:16] <Es0teric> eddiemonge i am not doing anything wrong.. i am following what it says on bootstrap
[21:20:19] <DeLorean719> right, except it seem to have outer square brackets
[21:20:24] <DeLorean719> *seems
[21:20:46] <Es0teric> http://jsfiddle.net/LrPHs/3/show
[21:21:05] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint @ DeLorean719
[21:21:06] <caniuse> DeLorean719: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[21:21:06] <bot-t1> DeLorean719, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[21:21:13] <coldhead> thanks caniuse, bot-t1
[21:21:13] * bot-t1 sighs
[21:21:27] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, bot-t1
[21:21:27] * bot-t1 sighs
[21:21:42] <DeLorean719> is valid!
[21:21:45] <eddiemonge> DeLorean719: yeah that means its an array
[21:21:52] <DeLorean719> ah I see
[21:21:56] <eddiemonge> bad bot-t1 loop
[21:22:06] <DeLorean719> so I guess my problem is figuring out how to access those values
[21:22:19] <DeLorean719> if the whole array is stored in data
[21:22:25] <eddiemonge> ...*cough* js basics *cough*...
[21:22:30] <DeLorean719> yes yes
[21:22:34] <DeLorean719> I'll get them down!
[21:22:57] <Es0teric> DeLorean719 -> www.codeacademy.com
[21:23:01] <Es0teric> i use that site alot
[21:23:03] <Es0teric> for js basics
[21:24:42] <Es0teric> eddiemonge did you see the new fiddle?
[21:27:41] <eddiemonge> yeah but im not troubleshooting twitter's bootstrap
[21:28:05] <eddiemonge> im mostly against it because its a cheap ripoff of jqueryui
[21:29:04] <Es0teric> eddiemonge well… i can live with the tooltips from bootstrap.. i just wanted that modal window
[21:29:17] <Es0teric> do you know any other modals?
[21:32:06] <eddiemonge> jqueryui
[21:32:47] <Es0teric> eddiemonge i dont like how it looks..
[21:34:22] <eddiemonge> then change how it looks
[21:35:26] <Es0teric> eddiemonge would the tooltips work in the jqueryui modal though/
[21:35:27] <Es0teric> ?
[21:36:50] <eddiemonge> its a jquery plugin so why wouldnt it?
[21:43:29] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, the dialog in jquery ui, would it activate on the container thats in the other page? like… $('#idofanchortotrig').on('click', function() { $('#idofcontainerincontactpg').dialog(); }); ?
[21:52:58] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: what are you trying to do? are you trying to call a dialog from a different page?
[21:53:07] <Es0teric> eddiemonge yes
[21:54:29] <Whirl3d> So, I create an image using jquery, assign a load handler to it, then define the src attribute so I can handle the image once it has successfully loaded. I watch it load and the height and width are still 0...any ideas or should I build a fiddle?
[22:00:18] <Whirl3d> nvm, I just added the width/height in the callback to the data object of the image so I could resize it even if it reports 0.

[22:10:31] <aqeel> hi room
[22:29:54] <asher[w]> hi all, im using jqueryui sortables for one of my projects, and i was wondering if there was a way to use nested sortables such that items on each level were constrained to the level they are in so that a child item cannot become a parent item and vice versa
[22:44:47] <jamesw> hi all
[22:44:48] <msk> There is a problem in  IE7 ... Submit button is not working ...but other broswers working fine.
[22:45:25] <ganesh_ariveguru> hi....i am using cherrypy as my server in my project, in my ajax call, i am getting json data from cherypy server page(example "/json_data" ), but using json file in ajax url will be the efficient one? pls clarify me, thanks in advance
[22:45:26] <jamesw> i have a lot of select boxes, I want to change their contents, and then set the value that it was selected to again if it is still in the list. is this possible without iterating the select boxes?
[22:48:56] <Whirl3d> what is the secret for center aligning elements. I have my element absolutely positione and yet it still refuses to change position--ever
[22:49:22] <coldhead> i don't believe you
[22:49:37] <Whirl3d> okay
[22:49:39] <SuperRoach|> Whirl3d,  that's a can of worms. Put up a sample somewhere. Theres always a reason its doing it.
[22:51:05] <Whirl3d> okay, coldhead was right. But I don't understand how it can be assigned a class that is absolutely positioned and yet it somehow loses the position attribute later...
[22:51:39] <Whirl3d> thanks coldhead, I didn't even think to check that since it's assigned a class that is absolutely positioned
[22:53:14] <coldhead> Whirl3d: you should be able to see the applicable rules in firebug or whatever
[22:53:29] <coldhead> and you should see the position:absolute crossed out
[22:53:35] <coldhead> if it's being overridden
[22:53:49] <coldhead> and whatever is overriding it will be there like a flagrant hussy
[22:54:00] <coldhead> but of course you know all that
[22:54:04] <Whirl3d> by what though? I don't have a single element that I have told to be anything other than absolutely positioned
[22:54:10] <Whirl3d> and I hate a hussy
[22:54:14] <coldhead> plugins?
[22:54:20] <coldhead> user stylesheet?
[22:54:29] <coldhead> whatever it is, firebug will know
[22:55:36] <oojacoboo> if I'm going up and down in the DOM using key codes and want to assign classes based on this, what's the best way of doing this?
[22:55:52] <oojacoboo> currently I'm relying on id's on the elements
[22:57:48] <coldhead> key codes?
[22:57:52] <coldhead> i don't follow
[22:57:55] <coldhead> me so stupido
[22:58:08] <oojacoboo> like, up down, enter
[22:58:16] <oojacoboo> keyboard commands
[22:58:22] <oojacoboo> js interpreted
[23:32:14] <DreamStiffler> any of u uys fammiliar with liferay or velocity?
[23:42:02] <coldhead> DreamStiffler: Jonathan_Neal used to work for liferay
[23:42:10] <coldhead> but he doesn't seem to be online atm
[23:42:22] <SuperRoach|> whoops - .toggle on body does irreversable damage.
[23:42:28] <coldhead> lol
[23:42:45] <Cork> SuperRoach|: what happens?
[23:43:12] <coldhead> last time i did it i had to reinstall my browser
[23:43:23] <SuperRoach|> lol not quite that bad
[23:43:47] <SuperRoach|> cork - in the accident i had, was a body with a background class on it. the toggle removed it didn't restore that back
[23:44:32] <Cork> doens't sound like it had anything to do with body at all
[23:44:46] <SuperRoach|> well, a background being used by body
[23:45:04] <Cork> sure
[23:45:26] <Cork> but you made it sound like toggle on body was broken :)
[23:46:54] <SuperRoach|> bugger,  Ican't make a working version in jsfiddle.
[23:47:37] <SuperRoach|> the short version: have a class on body. The class sets a background.   do a .toggle on body.... the background gets removed, and won't return with future toggles.
[23:49:14] <SuperRoach|> the problem with what im doing is that i'm doing toggle   , not toggleClass. toggle is the terminator!
