[03:13:58] <nate> Is there something that might prevent a .trigger('click'); at the bottom of a document .ready check?  I can enter the command into console and it runs fine, just doesn't seem to want to fire off on the .ready onload though
[03:15:26] <nate> I even tried adding a .delay in the middle but nogo, no console errors, no exceptions being thrown, just simply doesn't seem to actually trigger
[03:31:31] <thykka> nate, why are you trying to trigger a click event?
[03:35:47] <nate> thykka: A bit of a dynamic mobile based interface w/ page-sliding that might be up for a bit, was a certain event I was trying to trigger an effective click on though.  Doesn't look like it's the click that's the issue though, nothing I put inside teh if block is firing so gotta double check for typos lol
[03:40:52] <Cork> nate: have you checked so the selector finds the wanted element?
[03:41:16] <Cork> console.log($('the selector').length) right before the trigger is usually a good test
[09:56:57] <shadowswalker> Hello guys, I was using dataTable, but I wanted to implemente server side pagination (not server side processing with api), then I created a new pagination, I have turned off the paging: false, now when I load the page, the pagination looks fine for a second and after the datatable is loaded, it goes back to being the pagination of that datatable,
[11:18:16] <hilltop> Hi everyone. Baffled by a new problem that just cropped up in code that had been working for months. Two events: '$(document).on("click", ".threaditem", function () ...' and "$("#AdminThreadModal").on('shown.bs.modal', function ()..." are firing 2-15 times every time they're triggered. I can reduce (but not down to one) the number of firings by having "$(this).off('click');" as the first line of the function, but doesn't fix it compl
[11:19:05] <robertmaxrees> that cut off, but if you stick an e.stopPropagation(); in your handlers, it should be fine.
[11:19:17] <robertmaxrees> so long as you also pass the event object into your handler.
[11:19:50] <robertmaxrees> hilltop
[11:20:29] <hilltop> robertmaxress - I'll give it a shot - thanks!
[11:24:51] <hilltop> robertmaxrees - I tried this: $("#AdminThreadModal").on('shown.bs.modal', function (e) {     e.stopPropagation();, but I'm still getting 2-4 triggers per click
[11:25:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it then.
[11:26:38] <hilltop> https://pastebin.com/GDXey0bm
[11:26:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:27:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help sadly.  could you setup a minimal test case with jsfiddle?
[11:27:44] <hilltop> lots of parts there, certainly. I'll see what I can do. Thanks
[11:27:54] <robertmaxrees> what version of bootstrap?
[11:28:22] <hilltop> 3.3.5
[11:30:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jkztygb7/1/
[11:31:51] <robertmaxrees> this is why just the handler isn't sufficient - i'd try updating this so the markup and binding better reflect your page.  don't need to replcate the page, just enough of it to demonstrate the bug :)
[11:31:53] <hilltop> That's how it used to behave :) There's really nothing different
[11:32:39] <robertmaxrees> also: is that handler inside of a function that gets called more than once?
[11:33:07] <hilltop> Hmmm.... that's somethign good to check
[11:33:27] <robertmaxrees> try sticking a console.log('foo'); right before the binding.
[11:33:36] <robertmaxrees> if that fires multiple times, then the issue isn't the handler.
[11:36:52] <sibble> hello, i have a form where if a user clicks a radio box then more text inputs are added to the form via html insert, when i try to get the post i get a error: undefined index, if i put the text inputs on the form manually i can get the post
[11:37:12] <robertmaxrees> sibble got a fiddle?
[11:37:12] <hilltop> Adding that in the line before the binding shows it running once each time the function runs. The handler isn't inside any other functions, $(document), etc.
[11:37:22] <robertmaxrees> hilltop wait
[11:37:28] <robertmaxrees> "each time the function runs"
[11:37:32] <hilltop> np
[11:37:43] <robertmaxrees> nono - have a question :)
[11:37:50] <robertmaxrees> you're runing that handler more than once?
[11:37:57] <robertmaxrees> *running that binding more than once, rather
[11:38:33] <hilltop> not intentionally. foo shows up in the console twice per click, not before the click
[11:38:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:38:49] <FilipNortic_> last time I saw one of thoose he had added the script with the handlers more than once
[11:39:08] <robertmaxrees> hilltop so what about sticking a console.log('foo') before the evening binding?
[11:39:15] <robertmaxrees> how many times does that 'foo' show in the console?
[11:41:08] <hilltop> Just to be sure we're on the same page, the .on('click') or .on('shown....) line: right before that is where we're putting the log statements?
[11:41:14] <robertmaxrees> yes
[11:41:17] <robertmaxrees> the line before.
[11:43:14] <hilltop> ok. the one for the click runs when I reload the page
[11:43:21] <robertmaxrees> only once?
[11:43:31] <hilltop> thenonce when I click it
[11:43:40] <hilltop> That seems fine
[11:43:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:43:50] <robertmaxrees> is there a log within the click handler now?
[11:44:18] <robertmaxrees> show yer code.  something isn't adding up here.
[11:44:20] <hilltop> No, it's before, but that binding is inside a function that runs when that modal opens
[11:44:28] <robertmaxrees> ah
[11:44:31] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[11:44:37] <taplar> heh
[11:44:37] <robertmaxrees> you're re-binding every time the modal opens
[11:45:07] <hilltop> A little backstory: the button opens a list of conversation threads, which update automatically. When you open the modal showing them, it refreshes. This multiple fire isn't actually rpesenting a problem, but I'll still fix it
[11:45:22] <hilltop> The issue's with the shown.bs.modal one
[11:45:23] <robertmaxrees> it actually is a problem.
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> because you're binding multiple times.  i'd move that out into a delegated listener and be done with it.
[11:46:45] <hilltop> oh, it's being re-bound, too - I get one more fire every time I reopen the first modal. Whew. I think that I put it in there because it wasn't finding the object (which didn't exist yet), but I can fix that, I think
[11:47:06] <robertmaxrees> you just need to do a delegated listener.
[11:48:01] <hilltop> Do I have to explicitly use .delegate, or does $(document).... make it work, too?
[11:48:07] <robertmaxrees> neither]\
[11:48:22] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function(){});
[11:48:41] <robertmaxrees> where parent is any ancestor that exists at the time of binding and child is the thing you care about.
[11:48:51] <FilipNortic_> I did that too onve when I switched to felegated
[11:49:02] <FilipNortic_> and left the binding where it was before
[11:49:26] <hilltop> And in this case, the parent isn't the document, it's the previous modal, right?
[11:49:35] <robertmaxrees> "previous modal"?????
[11:49:59] <robertmaxrees> the ancestor needs to be an element that exists at the time of binding that is also an ancestor of the element you care about.
[11:50:18] <robertmaxrees> you should read through http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ for more info
[11:50:25] <hilltop> couldn't you just use document as the ancestor for all of them, though?
[11:50:26] <robertmaxrees> it's very simple once you grok the basic concept.
[11:50:35] <FilipNortic_> so usally the first elemnt known to exists at page load
[11:50:36] <robertmaxrees> you could, but that's a bad pattern.
[11:50:53] <robertmaxrees> since that means you're running logic on every single click on the page.
[11:51:28] <hilltop> That makes sense. Thanks for the time and the link! This is one of those things that I found via Google that has been black box for too long. Time to really understand it!
[11:51:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:58:36] <sinother> hello somebody can hel me whit bxslider? only need change position of slider, i cant move whit css
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> sinother gotta fiddle?
[13:59:55] <sinother> i can make
[14:03:26] <sinother> https://jsfiddle.net/sinother/g743care/1/
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:04:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wb63s1up/ fixed - could you add some actual pictures?
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> and then clarify what you're trying to do?
[14:06:33] <sinother> im try its my first fiddle
[14:07:14] <robertmaxrees> it's ok :)
[14:08:03] <Es0teric> i have this issue here: anybody here use gulp?
[14:08:12] <taplar> i've used it before
[14:08:21] <taplar> not saying i'm a guru with it
[14:10:31] <Es0teric> i have this https://kopy.io/kwffW
[14:10:35] <Es0teric> and the error is in the bottom
[14:10:40] <Es0teric> taplar
[14:11:02] <taplar> you want run sequence
[14:11:12] <taplar> ex.  gulp.task( 'production', callback => runSequence( 'mark-as-production', 'clean', 'build', 'deploy', callback ) );
[14:11:14] <Es0teric> what do you mean?
[14:11:27] <Es0teric> is that new?
[14:11:34] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[14:11:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty much always been like that.
[14:12:23] <Es0teric> wait what?
[14:12:33] <Es0teric> i remember i can just use function() instead of runSequence()
[14:12:43] <sinother> https://jsfiddle.net/sinother/g743care/5/
[14:12:44] <taplar> i'm assuming you are trying to tell it to run multiple steps with that one task, yes?
[14:13:03] <robertmaxrees> sinother erm.
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> you broke it heh
[14:13:10] <sinother> i need to put magin auto in css
[14:13:14] <Es0teric> taplar just click the link
[14:13:25] <robertmaxrees> sinother update the one i shared out.
[14:13:29] <taplar> i did, you're trying to give it an array as the second argument, rather than a function
[14:14:06] <robertmaxrees> sinother https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wb63s1up/3/
[14:14:35] <Es0teric> [14:14:26] ReferenceError: runSequence is not defined
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric share what you're trying to do.
[14:14:51] <taplar> var runSequence = require( 'run-sequence' );
[14:14:56] <taplar> m'bad
[14:14:57] <robertmaxrees> or ^
[14:14:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:15:02] <Es0teric> ohhh
[14:15:17] <Es0teric> ok i thought it was a built-in function lol
[14:15:22] <taplar> sorry, heh
[14:15:37] <taplar> i'm copying stuff from my old https://github.com/taplar/gulp-webpack-vue/blob/master/gulpfile.js
[14:15:53] <robertmaxrees> even better - just go with npm scripts and skip gulp entirely ;)
[14:16:07] <taplar> got that project too, ^_^
[14:16:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:16:34] <taplar> needs updating though.  i'm sure some of the resources are old by now
[14:20:05] <sinother> robertmaxrees still see the slider in top-right of the page, i would like center the slider
[14:20:42] <sinother> only margin-left and margin right auto but nothing happens
[14:20:48] <robertmaxrees> sinother you mean you want to center the carousel?
[14:20:55] <sinother> yea
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[14:22:06] <sinother> .container{
[14:22:06] <sinother>     margin-left: auto;
[14:22:06] <sinother>     margin-right: auto;
[14:22:06] <sinother> }
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> heh - pls don't paste in the channel.
[14:22:23] <robertmaxrees> let me look at that.
[14:22:51] <taplar> the container is at 100% width
[14:23:31] <taplar> the nested bx-wrapper is not
[14:24:23] <sinother> if try whit .bxslider class works for my?
[14:24:39] <taplar> ".bx-wrapper", and try and see, :)
[14:25:05] <taplar> Also I'm slightly confused.  I thought you led in with your questions saying you couldn't use css
[14:25:27] <taplar> Or was that meant as an "I haven't been able to make css work" statement?
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> the second
[14:25:39] <taplar> k
[14:28:00] <sinother> thanks so much, and where you see .bx-wrapper class i havent in my html, i tell for if i have any problem in the future :))))
[14:28:19] <taplar> right click on your element, and choose "inspect element"
[14:28:32] <taplar> you can see how the dom is structured real time
[14:29:58] <sinother> thank so so much
[14:30:04] <taplar> np
[14:30:21] <sinother> in future use the inspector :)
[14:30:29] <taplar> always, :)
[14:30:44] <taplar> inspector + console + debugger = your bread and butter
[14:31:59] <sinother> :)

[15:20:39] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48513573/gulp-error-gulp-hastask-is-not-a-function  might be related.  you may want to use gulp.series instead of runSequence
[15:24:53] <Es0teric> taplar i tried that
[15:24:56] <Es0teric> but still
[19:16:52] <z1haze> I am using $.getJSON() with a callback and then a chained .fail() call.. im getting a 200 response but its hitting the .fail() code.. is that normal?
[19:26:45] <z1haze> so my question then is what determines calling a fail function or not
[19:27:21] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/e748a69007f7 this with a 200 response is triggering the .fail() consolelog
