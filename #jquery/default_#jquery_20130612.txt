[00:02:54] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:05:12] <ansipants> wholy crap its 3 am
[00:05:30] <ansipants> guess i'll be working from home today
[00:05:45] <lemonsparrow> ansipants: sleep at the office :)
[00:06:12] <ansipants> lol, dont need to, make my own rules, do way too much work to get yelled at
[00:06:24] <ansipants> i'll call when i get up
[00:07:13] <fabioportieri> we got a badass over there
[00:07:21] <ansipants> =D
[00:08:57] <ansipants> i upgraded our servers earlier, that should make them happy
[00:10:55] <ansipants> oh well, wine bottles empty, uploads are done, night all
[00:13:26] <ragsagar> I need a widget which will be able to select different stages. jquery ui slider works. But in my case the last stage can be any one of three stages. Is there any widget to use in this scenario?
[00:14:02] <nightmare365> hi guys how can i have a method that i want to be executed when the dom is ready after loading content via ajax .. its a simple file manager so some of the images  take time to load .. is there a way to bind to this
[00:22:23] <nightmare365> hi guys how can i have a method that i want to be executed when the dom is ready after loading content via ajax .. its a simple file manager so some of the images  take time to load .. is there a way to bind to this
[00:33:48] <fella5s> How do i do AND on selector? Something like $('span[data-objId=5&data-objType=1]')
[00:33:58] <fella5s> or is it even possible
[00:43:58] <Eviltwin> fella5s: $('span[data-objId=5][data-objType=1]')
[00:45:37] <fella5s> Thanks.
[00:51:03] <fella5s> followup question, whats the best way to see if that hit anything?
[00:52:17] <fabioportieri> fella5s: .length > 0
[00:53:04] <fella5s> Thanks mate.
[00:53:44] <fella5s> got bit confused since logging that object didn't return null or undefined
[00:55:19] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[01:25:08] <anton164> Any tips on how I could wait for an element to equal a specific value, then if it does execute a click event on another element?
[01:26:05] <anton164> What about waiting for a change event and, if that happens check if it equals that specific value, if it does, execute the click event
[01:26:06] <anton164> ?
[01:30:44] <remybach> That sounds like a plan to me.
[01:31:00] <remybach> Better than polling for changes, that's for sure.
[01:49:23] <anton164> Hmm, that didn't work very well though, I don't think <h1> has a change event
[01:49:50] <remybach> Ah, no… you're looking for DOM mutation events, but those aren't very well supported.
[01:49:55] <Cork> change events only exist on elements the user can change
[01:50:00] <remybach> You're going to have to poll for changes I'm afraid.
[01:50:50] <anton164> Alright, so poll for changes, would be to .e.g check every 50ms?
[01:50:52] <Cork> anton164: why don't you just hook into the script that changes the element?
[01:51:00] <Cork> don't based it on timers
[01:51:02] <anton164> hook into?
[01:51:05] <Cork> it's horrible ideas
[01:51:18] <Cork> anton164: if the h1 tag changes something has to change it
[01:51:38] <anton164> Yes, but that's a whole different script, which wasn't made by me
[01:51:47] <anton164> I'm creating a wizard for a web application
[01:51:48] <Cork> so?
[01:51:51] <anton164> I still can_
[01:52:12] <Cork> is the script using a framework or does it modify the dom directly?
[01:52:52] <anton164> Directly
[01:53:04] <Cork> through innerHTML or something like that?
[01:55:13] <anton164> .text
[01:55:22] <Cork> so it is using a framework
[01:55:33] <Cork> is it jquery?
[01:55:51] <anton164> jQuery yes, sorry
[01:56:02] <anton164> So used to it now, forget its a framework :p
[01:56:31] <systemfault> It's a library :P Not a framework :P
[01:58:37] <Cork> you could do something like (function($) { var org_text = $.fn.text; $.fn.text = function() { if(this.is(target_element)) { callback_function(); } return org_text.apply($, arguments); }; })(jQuery);
[01:59:14] <Cork> then you would get notified every time someone uses .text to modify that element
[01:59:55] <Cork> (warning it is untested so there most likely are some bugs)
[02:01:49] <anton164> Alright, I'll try that, thank you!
[02:04:03] <Vloz_> Hi all
[02:04:27] <Vloz_> how am i supposed to bind an event to make tap and click do the same thing?
[02:04:44] <Cork> on('touchstart click')
[02:04:58] <Vloz_> thx Cork <3
[02:18:49] <daftspunk> hey does jQuery have an equivalent to mootools' filer() ?
[02:18:54] <daftspunk> filter*
[02:19:25] <daftspunk> var filteredArray = myArray.filter(function(sample) { return (isAwesome(sample)) ? true : false; });
[02:20:33] <lenswipee> nice coding
[02:21:22] <daftspunk> jQ's filter seems to only filter DOM elements element.filter(':checked');
[02:22:24] <daftspunk> found it! jQuery.grep()
[02:22:27] <daftspunk> yayyayaya
[02:22:43] <remybach> Ha ha… was about to post that.
[02:22:44] <lenswipee> ? grep
[02:22:45] <bot-t> jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[02:23:15] <systemfault> Thanks jquery for the stupid name ;)
[02:23:20] <daftspunk> ^
[02:26:30] <t4nk756> I am using Zend framework version 1.11.3 and jquery mobile version 1.3.0-beta.1. My functionalities of login,registration,swipe do not work unless I refresh the pages.Where am I going wrong?
[02:27:43] <daftspunk> t4nk756: wrap ur code in this jQuery(document).ready(function($) {   /* code */ });
[02:34:20] <t4nk756> daftspunk: I have tried doing so still the same problem persists
[02:35:12] <t4nk756> I even tried using $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', function(){..});
[02:39:36] <dakota_> Good day
[02:41:05] <dakota_> Is there a way to determine the type of ajax request (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) from the ajaxStart (and similar) event?
[03:09:29] <snorti> any idear how i can get the .navteasebox stay while i go down to the link in this box? jsfiddle.net/BfUqs
[03:15:17] <Cork> snorti: you can't really base it on hover if you want that to work
[03:15:41] <SR> @snorti - it stays for me...only catch is one has to hover on the small triangle
[03:16:23] <Cork> triangle?
[03:16:50] <SR> yeah the white arrow thing...which itself is moving
[03:17:10] <Cork> SR: hover a green field
[03:17:16] <Cork> you should see a bubble at the bottom
[03:17:27] <Cork> there is a link there; i think he wants to be able to press those
[03:20:09] <SR> Cork: okay i see it now...yes you are right only on hover might not work here
[03:22:33] <Cork> snorti: what you could do is have it show on hover; and the other one is hidden when the first one is shown
[03:22:59] <Cork> snorti: it would still mean you have to zig-zag down between the buttons to not trigger another hover
[03:23:02] <Cork> but it would work
[03:23:41] <Cork> though i think the best solution is to have it show on hover, and stay visible on click (disable hover changes)
[03:23:54] <Cork> though not sure how user friendly that would be
[03:24:06] <dakota_> Is there a way to determine the type of ajax request (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) from the ajaxStart (or similar) event?
[03:24:14] <snorti> but this would produce a glitch i think
[03:24:42] <snorti> hm
[03:25:10] <systemfault> dakota_: Why don't you simply try?
[03:26:31] <Cork> dakota_: ajaxSend should have the options passed to the ajax call
[03:26:36] <Cork> ?.ajaxsend
[03:26:37] <bot-t> .ajaxSend(handler): Attach a function to be executed before an Ajax request is sent. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSend/
[03:27:49] <dakota_> Cork, ah, thanks. That is what I was looking for. Didn't see it on my search through the docs
[03:28:00] <Cork> ?ajaxevents
[03:28:07] <bot-t> Cork, Ajax Events | jQuery API Documentation - Ajax requests produce a number of different events that you can subscribe to. Here's a full list of the events and in what order they are triggered. http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[03:31:11] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/n7tCg/ is it possible to change the href attrib of the <a> and keep the result as a string ?
[03:32:40] <Cork> noregret: regex
[03:32:42] <systemfault> Welll… a stupid regex
[03:33:11] <Cork> replace(/href=""/, 'href=""');
[03:34:08] <Cork> or you could go the long way create a containing element, add the html to it (parse it) modify the href of the a tag, and then serialize it to html again
[03:34:19] <Cork> though that would be a giant waist of time
[03:38:31] <huglester> guys, what is the best way to disable cache in firefox?
[03:38:48] <huglester> I have issues when ctlr+f5, ctrl+shift+r does not help, since ckeditor loads js files later
[03:39:19] <lemonsparrow> I have x = [{code:"EFFECT", desc:"Good Effect"}] now how to acces "EFFECT"   ?
[03:39:45] <fella5s> x[0].code?
[03:40:11] <Cork> huglester: set the cache to 0?
[03:40:14] <lemonsparrow> fella5s: thanks
[03:40:26] <huglester> Cork: where actually?
[03:40:33] <Cork> in the advanced options
[03:42:09] <noregret> thanks Cork
[03:46:44] <azazel91> anybody know how to put multiple values in a autocomplete box
[03:47:06] <Cork> azazel91: you can't you need to use separate elements
[03:47:16] <Cork> azazel91: there is an example on the demo page
[03:48:06] <azazel91> cork have you seen myspaces autocomplete
[03:48:18] <Cork> ah, you mean separate hits
[03:48:26] <azazel91> yeah
[03:48:36] <Cork> yes that is possible (there is an example for that too :P )
[03:48:41] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple
[03:49:16] <Cork> (custom data was the one i talked about before)
[03:55:12] <azazel91> cork is there a possible way to make it type as you go
[03:55:26] <noregret> Cork: replace(/href=".*"/, 'href="test"') isn't working out for me, is it a wrong match ?
[03:55:27] <Cork> you mean inline complete?
[03:55:49] <Cork> noregret: depends on what you want to match
[03:56:07] <Cork> try replace(/href="[^"]+"/, 'href="test"')
[03:56:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: need ur help with the same thing u helped me last time around with... this time its complicated http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/GsYbP/
[03:56:39] <lemonsparrow> Cork: look at the input.. i got to iterate that inside the map :(
[03:57:02] <noregret> Cork: still no match
[03:57:21] <Cork> noregret: do you have a fiddle?
[03:57:42] <azazel91> hmm cork i just want it to have four places to click @hotmail.com,@yahoo,.com,@aol.com,@gmail
[03:58:47] <Cork> azazel91: you mean that the autocomplete should be visible by default?
[03:58:59] <Cork> i think you can trigger the visibility of the dropdown
[04:00:14] <noregret> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/n7tCg/1/
[04:00:15] <azazel91> no its already visit it is when they type there username i just want it to highlight the network domain as they type their username yahoo.com,aol.com etc
[04:00:30] <vedic> I need to fetch all the values of the column tz from the table as mentioned in here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones  .  How to extract values from a table? I have experiemented something like: $("table.wikitable tbody tr td")[2]  which gives me <td> object for the first value in "tz" column. How to fetch text for all the values in that column?
[04:01:17] <Cork> noregret: heh, you forgot to change your changes http://jsfiddle.net/n7tCg/2/
[04:02:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you mean http://jsfiddle.net/GsYbP/1/ ?
[04:02:31] <noregret> Cork: oops :)
[04:03:02] <Cork> uh... to change your changes?? * to save your changes
[04:04:06] <Cork> vedic:
[04:04:08] <Cork> opps
[04:04:40] <vedic> Cork: Can you help?
[04:05:13] <noregret> Cork: is this the right regex /href="([^"]+)"/ to remember the URL ?
[04:05:22] <anton164> Is it possible to check what is bound to a .click event?
[04:05:37] <t4nk756> How to refresh a page so that the dynamically added message is visible ?My code ::$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', function(){           $(document).on('click','#login',function(e) {             	$.ajax({	url: '/index/loginform', 			       data: $('#loginform').serialize() + '&action=send', 			       type: 'post', 			       cache: false, 			       dataType: 'html', 			      success: function (data) {                                 
[04:06:38] <vedic> var tdArray = $("table.wikitable tbody tr td"); gives me tdArray as Object[td, td, td, td, td, td] . Now how to fetch text from one of these td in the object? eg: tdArray[2] gives me output: <td> but I need text between <td></td>
[04:06:42] <vedic> Cork:^
[04:07:02] <Cork> vedic: something like this should work: var th = $('th'); var index = td.filter(function() { return $(this).html() == 'TZ*'; }).index(); $('tr td:nth-child(' + index +')');
[04:08:05] <vedic> Cork: It gives me error
[04:08:17] <Cork> whats the error?
[04:08:31] <Cork> opps td.filter should be th.filter
[04:09:04] <Cork> actually $('tr td:nth-child(' + index +')'); should just be $('td:nth-child(' + index +')');
[04:10:38] <vedic> Cork: It gives me an object: Object[td, td, td, td, td, td, td, td, td, .... ]
[04:10:45] <vedic> How to fetch text from it?
[04:10:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: my bad was a simple one.. solved it thanks :)
[04:11:33] <Cork> vedic: $.map($('tr td:nth-child(' + index +')'), function(elm) { return $(elm).html(); });
[04:12:19] <Ricaz> Say I have $('.box').mouseenter(function() { blabla... }); - how would I later in the script unbind this event? $('.box').unbind(); doesn't seem to work
[04:12:41] <Cork> $('.box').unbind('mouseenter')
[04:12:50] <vedic> Cork: That gives me values from Coordinate column.
[04:13:30] <Cork> ah right it's not zero based
[04:13:41] <Cork> vedic: replace index with (index + 1)
[04:13:48] <Cork> in the last selector
[04:13:56] <vedic> Cork:ok
[04:14:00] <Ricaz> Cork, still doesn't work. I should mention I'm doing this from an extension
[04:14:05] <Ricaz> in Chrome
[04:14:08] <Draxelis> http://jsfiddle.net/Dmtes/1/   I want the text to alter on each click
[04:14:28] <Cork> Ricaz: then there is something messing with things from the extension space
[04:15:16] <Cork> Draxelis: alter?
[04:15:20] <Cork> you mean toggle?
[04:15:42] <vedic> Cork: That gives me now right column but with html: ["<a href="/wiki/Africa/A...jan">Africa/Abidjan</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Africa/A...Accra">Africa/Accra</a>", ... ]
[04:15:58] <Draxelis> Cork,  yes, sort of. On one click the text is "A" on second click it goes back to original text.
[04:18:38] <someone235> hey guys, you know a way to upload files & form-data using the same form VIA AJAX?
[04:19:04] <Cork> Draxelis: http://jsfiddle.net/Dmtes/2/
[04:19:12] <jmmy> someone235, .ajax()
[04:19:17] <systemfault> someone235: XHR2 + FormData if you don't need to support old browsers
[04:19:27] <systemfault> someone235: An hidden iframe for old browsers..
[04:19:33] <Cork> Draxelis: also use links for links, not for actions; so either use another element instead of <a> or provide a valid link for it
[04:19:36] <vedic> Cork: $.map($('td:nth-child(' + (index + 1) +')'), function(elm) { return $($(elm).html()).text(); });
[04:19:52] <vedic> Cork: You gave me right direction. Many thanks
[04:20:08] <Draxelis> Cork, thanks. What should I replace <a> with?
[04:20:11] <someone235> systemfault, there's no way except iframes for old browsers?
[04:20:17] <systemfault> someone235: Nope.
[04:20:19] <Cork> vedic: uh... no
[04:20:30] <Cork> vedic: $($(elm).html()).text() is utterly over complicated
[04:20:57] <Cork> if you want it's text only use $(elm).text()
[04:21:09] <jmmy> Draxelis, what is .toggle.on?
[04:21:25] <Cork> jmmy: check the css section
[04:21:39] <jmmy> Cork, thats where I saw it
[04:21:44] <Cork> Draxelis: <span tabstop="0" class="link"> for example
[04:22:28] <jmmy> whats that tabstop="0", never seen anything likei t
[04:22:36] <vedic> Cork: I see.
[04:23:10] <Draxelis> Cork,  I want each click to toggle some text (message) in html. Is this way you gave me, a proper way of implement this?
[04:23:15] <Draxelis> implementing*
[04:23:20] <Cork> Draxelis: http://jsfiddle.net/Dmtes/4/
[04:23:20] <vedic> Cork: Is there any way to list all the items in this output. The console shows few items and then says 260 more... . How to list everything
[04:23:49] <jmmy> Draxelis, I see, instead of .hide() on all the class items, you are developing how to do it for individual elements eh, awesome
[04:23:57] <Cork> Draxelis: the content of the page should be in the html, so just have them in hidden elements, and toggle them with a class
[04:24:48] <Draxelis> jmmy,  ye:)) because I target only 1 button. I need text to toggle on that button
[04:25:07] <Cork> Draxelis: but if you want to have the text dynamically added, you need to store the old content
[04:25:17] <jmmy> what does it mean in css when you have .toggle vs .toggle.on?
[04:25:18] <Cork> as it will be replaced in the page
[04:25:26] <Cork> jmmy: two classes
[04:25:30] <Cork> both must match
[04:25:41] <Cork> .toggle.on or .on.toggle is the same thing
[04:25:43] <jmmy> Cork, self explanatory.  thx for saying it though
[04:26:03] <Cork> jmmy: well ya, kinda; but you did ask ;)
[04:26:14] <jmmy> Cork, yes, thank you for answering
[04:26:25] <jmmy> It is self explanatory, but I never thought of it before
[04:26:36] <Draxelis> Cork,  can't I have smth like:  change span message to "ODD click" on first click, then "even click" on second click", and loop it?
[04:26:38] <jmmy> This opens a whole new world of possibilities
[04:26:48] <Cork> Draxelis: sure
[04:26:55] <Draxelis> Cork,  that is without hiding and showing it
[04:27:03] <Cork> Draxelis: but then you would have content in your javascript; and that is kinda wrong
[04:27:26] <Draxelis> It's fine i think:)
[04:27:31] <Cork> html should hold the content; css the style, and javascript the control of what happens
[04:28:00] <Draxelis> I need it just for 1 button. I want icon (text) to change on each click
[04:28:02] <Cork> so elements in html, classes should be used from javascript for styling, and css should do the styling
[04:28:35] <Cork> Draxelis: you should try keeping your javascript dry and unobstructive; let it act based on what the html holds
[04:28:44] <Cork> instead of having js written specifically for one element
[04:28:58] <Cork> you end up with WAY less js that way
[04:29:13] <Cork> (and the page still looks and behaves the same)
[04:29:40] <Cork> it also makes it easier to maintain, as you don't have to dig through the js to update the page
[04:29:47] <Draxelis> Cork,  I know what you mean, but other way I need to change html, css and js, whereas if it was only in js, that would be easier in this case
[04:29:49] <snorti> is it possible to disable an input with jquery?
[04:30:03] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:30:05] <remybach> $('input').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[04:30:11] <Cork> no
[04:30:17] <Cork> prop('disabled', true)
[04:30:18] <Cork> not attr
[04:30:44] <Cork> attr won't work cross browsers as not all browsers monitor the attributes for dynamic changes
[04:31:10] <Cork> while the property is meant to be used for dynamic changes
[04:31:12] <remybach> Fair point.
[04:31:27] <someone235> if someone else knows about a way to upload VIA ajax for old browsers without using IFRAME, please inform me
[04:31:45] <Cork> Somatt_wrk_: iframe or plugins is the only way
[04:31:48] <Cork> opps
[04:31:51] <Cork> *someone235:
[04:32:05] <Cork> it can't be done with pure js, as js can't access the file data
[04:32:11] <vedic> How to show all the values in an array in firebug console? Any idea? I have an array which has about 500 items. When I use console.log(myvar), it shows me few array items and then says "268 more...". How to see all the values? I need to copy this array values to use in another language
[04:32:13] <Cork> (before the File api)
[04:32:28] <Cork> vedic: click the link in the array
[04:32:36] <dwarder> i'm creating an extention for google chrome, is it possible to send a file from extention?
[04:32:40] <dwarder> the problem is, when i chose a file, my popup get closed
[04:32:44] <Cork> vedic: wait are you trying to extract the data from the table?
[04:32:46] <dwarder> choose*
[04:32:57] <Cork> vedic: why don't you just use the table selector in the browser?
[04:33:27] <DukeDrake> I try to access elements like $('#container')[index]. Although there are four elements in my container, I can only access two, $('#container').lenght is also 2 , which refer to the second and fourth element
[04:33:50] <Cork> vedic: ctrl select the cells and the ctrl+c
[04:33:53] <Cork> done :)
[04:33:57] <DukeDrake> I know that this points to a syntax error in the DOM ... however I can't find any ...
[04:34:11] <Draxelis> Cork,  I understanding your point about html, css and js but I need to toggle small piece of text in html. If it is controlled by js, I'd need to edit 1 file, otherwise I'd need to change html, css, js. For a small thing like that, having it couple lines of js that do all the job would be more convenient.
[04:34:44] <Cork> Draxelis: your looking at it from the code point of view; the html will have to hold the "default" value
[04:34:48] <snorti> thx cork & remybach
[04:35:03] <Cork> Draxelis: and if you later want to change the values you have to modify the html AND the strings in js
[04:35:07] <vedic> Cork: ok, I converted that tz value array into json string and then console.log showed the full string. Then I copied that string and decoded back in another language where I need to process this array
[04:35:14] <Cork> Draxelis: instead of it all being in the html
[04:35:24] <Draxelis> but i wouldnt need to edit css
[04:35:35] <Draxelis> and css is massive:)
[04:35:37] <Cork> its 4 dynamic classes
[04:35:56] <Cork> that you can reuse every time you want a toggle like that
[04:36:01] <Draxelis> hm
[04:36:02] <Cork> i really don't see the problem
[04:36:03] <Draxelis> good point
[04:36:14] <Draxelis> Cork,  it's reusable:)
[04:36:20] <DukeDrake> any hints?
[04:36:21] <Draxelis> so ye it makes more sense
[04:36:35] <Cork> if you do it like that; you just add the toggle class and the child spans to an element; and bam it works; no extra code
[04:37:10] <Draxelis> yep, got it. tnx Cork
[04:38:23] <DukeDrake> why does jQuery only find two elements, when there are four????
[04:38:41] <Cork> ?p @ DukeDrake
[04:38:45] <systemfault> DukeDrake: You're doing something wrong ;)
[04:38:47] <DukeDrake> $('#container a').length
[04:38:47] <Draxelis> btwm Cork  you seaid to change <a> into something else, if I still use <a>, is it wrong?
[04:39:20] <Cork> Draxelis: links should be links not href="#" href="javascript:void()" or similar
[04:39:39] <Draxelis> ok
[04:39:42] <Cork> Draxelis: if you have those, then ya you use hacks that was needed ~10 years ago
[04:39:59] <Cork> in ie 5.5 that didn't support click on anything but links
[04:40:14] <Draxelis> :) ok
[04:40:33] <Cork> Draxelis: the last link i gave you have the suggested tabindex replacement
[04:40:49] <dwarder> has anyone created a google chrome extention?
[04:41:12] <Cork> sure, not with jquery though
[04:41:51] <Draxelis> Cork,  is this tabindex necessary, can I have just span.someclass?
[04:41:59] <dwarder> Cork: i have this popup page, there i put an <input type=file>, which closes my popup extention window
[04:42:08] <dwarder> Cork: when i have chosen the file
[04:42:34] <Cork> Draxelis: if you want the element to support tab focus, it is, else no
[04:42:51] <Draxelis> ok
[04:42:53] <Draxelis> tnx
[04:43:03] <dwarder> Cork: is there a way to upload a file from google extention?
[04:43:08] <DukeDrake> ok, I stripped the error down to this: it works with <span>... </span> tags, but as soon as I change 'span' to 'a', jQuery skips two elements :/
[04:43:23] * DukeDrake is puzzled -.-
[04:43:27] <Cork> dwarder: wow, uh. i'm sure it's possible, never needed to though
[04:43:28] <jds> Heya
[04:43:51] <jds> How come $('<input/>', {placeholder:'search by title'}) ignores the placeholder attribute?
[04:43:53] <Cork> DukeDrake: make a demo on jsfiddle.net
[04:44:05] <DukeDrake> Cork: good idea.
[04:44:14] <jds> $('<input/>').attr({placeholder:'search by title'}) works fine, as does $('<input/>', {id:'foo'})
[04:44:25] <dwarder> Cork: i tried to google with no luck, looks like it is not a popular task
[04:44:29] <Cork> jds: wfm
[04:45:16] <jds> Cork: Huh.  Yeah, I can't reproduce in jsfiddle. Wonder what's up with my code
[04:45:31] <dwarder> Cork: well, i found the same question with no answer :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16257778/file-upload-in-google-chrome-extension-popup
[04:45:32] <Cork> jds: http://jsfiddle.net/Pf4Ps/
[04:45:52] <dan2k3k4> is it possible to 'hide all other classes matching class X except for the one where onclick was clicked' ?
[04:45:56] <Cork> dwarder: have a look at the file api, it might help you
[04:46:13] <Cork> dan2k3k4: $('class').not(this)
[04:46:23] <dan2k3k4> Cork: cool thanks
[04:46:47] <dwarder> Cork: maybe i can workaround it by forcing to keep the focus by js means?
[04:47:18] <Cork> dwarder: you might have to use something like a background page
[04:47:27] <dwarder> Cork: when i click to "browse" for a file, the popup window looses the focus
[04:47:59] <Cork> anyway sounds a bit off topic for this channel
[04:48:14] <dwarder> Cork: background page? iframe?
[04:48:19] <dwarder> Cork: ok, right...
[04:48:21] <jds> Cork: Ohhh.  I have a $.fn.placeholder function, which is confusing things.
[04:48:30] <Cork> dwarder: no extensions can start a background page
[04:48:47] <Cork> jds: ah
[04:49:17] <Cork> dwarder: its a page the extension runs in the background, its not visible at all (it normally runs in a separate process even)
[04:49:41] <Cork> but not sure, not fully sure what problem you're seeing
[04:50:16] <Cork> i've never gotten even close to having to handle files uploads from extensions
[04:50:28] <Cork> (in any browser)
[04:51:30] <DukeDrake> guess what .... the same code works in jsfiddle >.>
[04:51:35] <dwarder> Cork: well, maybe this could help https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/fileBrowserHandler.html
[04:51:50] <dwarder> Cork: no, it won't help
[04:51:56] <dwarder> only on Chrome OS.
[04:52:02] <Cork> heh
[04:52:12] <dan2k3k4> Cork: then I suppose to only change the current one? I just do $(this).css() ?
[04:52:25] <Cork> dan2k3k4: yes
[04:53:00] <dan2k3k4> or is there a .is(this)
[04:53:06] <dan2k3k4> that I can chain?
[04:53:23] <Cork> there is little point in chaining
[04:53:32] <dan2k3k4> ok :)
[04:53:44] <Cork> as you want everything except in one, and only in the other
[04:53:54] <Cork> so there is no common ground
[04:54:01] <jop008> I am using IE9 and have console.log in my site this causes IE9 to break
[04:54:21] <jop008> In my lib I added this 2 lines console = console || {};
[04:54:22] <jop008> console.log = console.log || function(){};
[04:54:25] <Cork> jop008: ya it only exists in when the development console is open
[04:54:38] <jop008> but still an error message
[04:55:03] <jop008> Yes my customer got the error since he dont have the console open
[04:55:24] <Cork> jop008: just doing if(window.console == undefined) { window.console = { log: function() {} }; } should work
[04:55:27] <jop008> Are the 2 lines fine?
[04:55:35] <jop008> Okay thx test this
[05:10:05] <Draxelis> Cork,  in your example you did .toggle.on , it's the same as .toggle on or .toggle .on?
[05:10:34] <Cork> Draxelis: class="toggle on"
[05:10:39] <Cork> or class="on toggle"
[05:10:52] <Draxelis> css has .toggle.on
[05:11:01] <Cork> yes, but that is what it matches
[05:11:08] <Cork> elements with both classes
[05:11:26] <Draxelis> so if in the css it was .toggle .on it would be the same, right?
[05:11:27] <jmmy> when you have .toggle .ontext, that means the element of class .ontext is a child of element of class .toggle
[05:11:36] <Cork> no
[05:11:54] <Cork> that would be <elm class="toggle"><elm class="on"></elm></elm>
[05:12:03] <jmmy> when you have .toggle.on, that mean the class is both .toggle and .on as in class="toggle on" or class="on toggle"
[05:12:10] <Draxelis> oh
[05:12:11] <Draxelis> ok
[05:12:19] <jmmy> Cork, sibling?
[05:12:23] <Cork> no
[05:12:27] <Cork> sibling is ~
[05:13:03] <jmmy> But offtext is child and ontext are siblings whose parent is toggle
[05:13:14] <Cork> yes
[05:13:30] <Cork> space is child or grandchild selectors
[05:13:44] <Cork> without space it is the same element
[05:14:40] <Draxelis> :)
[05:14:45] <jmmy> :)
[05:14:50] <Draxelis> reverse engineering your example :D
[05:15:21] <Cork> it is mainly just css
[05:15:26] <Cork> and simple html
[05:16:09] <Draxelis> yep
[05:17:02] <seutje> <Cork> there is little point in chaining <- pun intended?
[05:17:27] <Cork> heh no
[05:40:42] <noregret> I have a click event on a <tr> but in that tr, there is a <td> with an anchor, and when I click on that anchor, the click event ot <tr> gets triggered, how can I avoid that ?
[05:41:06] <jmmy> noregret, post it on jsfiddle please
[05:41:13] <Cork> noregret: event.target or stopPropagation
[05:41:32] <Cork> event.target in the tr event handler or stopPropagation bound to the a tag
[05:41:35] <noregret> Cork: for the anchor click event ?
[05:41:39] <noregret> ah
[05:42:02] <Cork> event.target.nodeName == 'A' for example
[05:42:21] * Cork checks so it was actually nodeName...
[05:42:24] <Draxelis> preparing jsfiddle for a show :)
[05:42:40] <noregret> cool, stopPropagation worked nicely, thanks
[05:45:13] <aladdinwang> hi all, can different page communicate with each other with the help of jquery?
[05:45:25] <Cork> no
[05:45:29] <aladdinwang> the two pages are under the same domain
[05:45:45] <Cork> are they loaded in separate tabs?
[05:45:51] <Cork> or are they replacing each other?
[05:46:42] <aladdinwang> like parent and child, user click a link on parent page to open child, do something and close the child window, notify parent to reload innerHtml
[05:46:49] <MariusIT> any ideeas what i did wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/kSSqZ/
[05:47:06] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I was wondering if there was any way to have a function only return something, after an event has been triggered. The ability to trigger the event is only available after the function has begun execution. Is this even (sanely) possible?
[05:47:11] <Cork> aladdinwang: ah, that would be though var ref = window.open
[05:47:16] <Cork> ?g mdn window.open
[05:47:17] <b-ot> Cork: window.open - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.open
[05:47:41] <remybach> @MariusIT, you're selecting by ID when the anchor tag has a class on it.
[05:47:45] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: it's not, you would have to use callbacks
[05:47:46] <remybach> Should be $('.disabled')
[05:48:01] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Ok, I'll find another way about it. Thanks!
[05:48:35] <jmmy> DeltaHeavy, break up the function into two parts
[05:49:12] <MariusIT> it's not the .disabled part http://jsfiddle.net/kSSqZ/1/
[05:49:44] <Cork> jquery isn't loaded as a dependency
[05:49:51] <DeltaHeavy> jimmy: The thing is, this function is the condition for an if statement, and returns either true or false =/  Would be kinda difficult
[05:50:04] <Cork> MariusIT: http://jsfiddle.net/kSSqZ/2/
[05:50:32] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: you can only use return for synchronous javascript
[05:50:44] <Cork> events, timers, and network calls is async, so return isn't possible
[05:51:02] <MariusIT> Cork: i think i'm retarded, what's the difference?
[05:51:11] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Yeah, that's why I was figuring there was  good chance it was impossible. I was thinking though there MIGHT be something to almost kinda halt the execution of a function, or make it hang until a condition was met.
[05:51:13] <aladdinwang> Cork: but how to operate parent element in the child?
[05:51:18] <Cork> MariusIT: the dropdown on the left
[05:51:27] <Cork> aladdinwang: window.parent
[05:51:40] <MariusIT> pfoaaa
[05:51:40] <DeltaHeavy> I think this is a bad case of thinking at the keyboard. It's not an awful lot of code but I guess I'll just take a little bit of a different approach.
[05:51:46] <MariusIT> Cork: ok, thanks :)
[05:51:47] <jmmy> oh he forgot to include jquery
[05:52:11] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: if you would wait for them to trigger (ex. through a loop) they would never happen, cause async can only happen when the browser has gotten the control back (the stack has unwind)
[05:52:46] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, thanks
[05:52:53] <aladdinwang> Cork: haha! Thanks! Wish you happy and lucy!
[05:53:06] <Cork> aladdinwang: heh, thx
[05:54:02] <colock> hello, i'm looking at jQuery Mobile and have a question about styling: I want a two-rows group of checkboxes, (doing it with two groups right now), and to make 'em look nice, i want to override the generated class, i.e. instead of ui-corner-{left,right} i want ui-corner-{tl,tr} for the first,last checkboxes of the first group, and ui-corner-{bl,br} for the first,last checkboxes of the second group. How can I
[05:54:03] <colock> achieve this? only with javascript or can I add some magic attribute to override some jquery ui classes?
[05:56:24] <Draxelis> Cork,  please see this http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/14/ If you click on one of the boxes, some sub-lis will appear. I want those boxes in red appear like a grid 2x2 if 4 boxes, and in line 3x3 if 3 boxes or 6.  How can I do this?
[05:56:45] <Draxelis> Not sure if you know what i mean
[05:56:46] <Draxelis> :)
[05:58:15] <Cork> Draxelis: css can't really help you there (yet) you would have to adjust the width's of the elements through a class to
[05:58:28] <Draxelis> if click on T-C, six boxes appear. It would be better if they were lined in two rows each  having 3
[05:58:41] <Cork> class="3column" class="2column" kinda thing
[05:59:18] <Cork> flex grid cloud do it, but it isn't stable yet
[05:59:50] <aladdinwang> Cork: Do you know how to let parent window reload some innerHtml, just before closing the child window?
[06:00:03] <Cork> aladdinwang: "reload"??
[06:00:09] <aladdinwang> Cork: en, i think is easy thru jquery
[06:00:11] <Draxelis> hm so maybe adding two boxes in one div would help?
[06:00:31] <Draxelis> hm
[06:00:55] <aladdinwang> using the child window may  be better..
[06:01:00] <aladdinwang> it's easy to me
[06:01:33] <Draxelis> jmmy, can you help with this http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/14/  ?:)
[06:02:58] <jmmy> Draxelis, hmm, what do you want to do?
[06:04:14] <DeltaHeavy> If I get a console error, and the error says it's in a line of jQ, how can I find out where that error is in MY code?
[06:04:17] <Draxelis> jmmy if you click on T-C, it has 6 boxes in 2 collums. I would be better if there were 3 cllumns and 2 rows. And if click on T-B boxes should be in 2 callumns
[06:05:48] <jmmy> Draxelis, float:left; and then clear left every third one
[06:06:31] <amaroks> hello
[06:06:41] <amaroks> Why 0.4862 + 0.0004 = 0.48660000000000003
[06:07:10] <Draxelis> jmmy, do I have to set specific classes for every third box? or all can be done with css?
[06:07:34] <jmmy> Draxelis, In the css
[06:08:07] <Draxelis> so smth with nth-child i presume
[06:09:37] <remybach> @amaroks: It's a floating point issue. See here: http://floating-point-gui.de/
[06:20:08] <Ice_Black> $(document).on('blur','.coachNote',function () { }
[06:20:15] <Ice_Black> This seem to be executing twice
[06:20:16] <Ice_Black> why?
[06:20:33] <Ice_Black> When textbox is no longer selected
[06:27:35] <dan2k3k4> say I have a div wrapper with text and some links inside, but I want to set the div wrapper so that it does basically href with specific class [for popping up a lightbox]
[06:27:48] <dan2k3k4> could I just use onclick for the div wrapper
[06:28:35] <dan2k3k4> would a lightbox still load with onclick? or does it have to be from a "<a href='' class='lightbox'>" element?
[06:30:25] <remybach> Are you using a framework for the lightbox functionality or are you doing it manually?
[06:31:09] <dan2k3k4> using fancybox
[06:31:33] <dan2k3k4> onclick="$(this).fancybox(url)" ?
[06:31:58] <remybach> Ah, good old fancybox… haven't used it in a while - there may be a way to trigger it using the fancybox API.
[06:32:37] <remybach> But if not, have a dummy anchor that's not visible and do "$('div').on('click', function() { $('a.fancybox').trigger('click'); });
[06:33:13] <dan2k3k4> remybach: ah cool, didn't realize I could do like that too, cheers
[06:36:25] <dan2k3k4> could I do $(this a.fancybox) ?
[06:37:14] <myosotis> $(this).find('a.fancybox') ?
[06:37:48] <dan2k3k4> no what I mean is I want the current <div>'s a.fancybox and none of the other a.fancybox that exist in the other divs?
[06:38:24] <dan2k3k4> though I suppose I should just add an ID instead
[06:38:26] <myosotis> find only finds descendants of the element it's called on. I believe what I typed will do what you are looking for.
[06:38:38] <Ice_Black> fancybox work nicely with 1.7 jquery
[06:38:45] <remybach> Yeah, you could, and @myosotis has the correct implementation.
[06:38:52] <Ice_Black> fancybox have not been updated for years
[06:39:49] <dan2k3k4> unfortunately I'm stuck with some old project code that needs updating ;( and have been told not to change/update too many things :/
[06:40:07] <dan2k3k4> myosotis: ah ok cheers
[06:40:13] <myosotis> then update just enough things to make it work like they want
[06:40:35] <dan2k3k4> myosotis: yeah that's what I'm doing :) but the code is so :(
[06:40:36] <Darkstar1> Hello all I need some help figuring out this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/darkstar1/geJ4s/21/ two things wrong with it. First the animation jump but I think I can get to the bottom of that. second is that when I click I only want the active panel to be coloured green and the others to revert back to black
[06:40:44] <myosotis> I know the feeling
[06:41:35] <dan2k3k4> like I would at least preferred if this work followed a coding standard
[06:42:21] <dan2k3k4> mixed tabs and spaces all over the place with sometimes no spaces between if var="something" or var = "something"
[06:42:44] <dan2k3k4> (php/smarty template files etc.)
[06:43:29] <dan2k3k4> although I believe there are some IDEs that can refactor everything to a specific coding standard
[06:44:57] <Draxelis> Can someone help out with this http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/16/  If you click on boxes, some sub-boxes will appear. I want to make boxes (in numbers 3, 6, 9) appear in 3 callumns and those that are in groups 2, 4 appear in 2 callumns. How do i achieve this?
[06:45:15] <Darkstar1> can anyone help me out pls? just a hint in the right drection would be nice.
[06:49:00] <c4ptnh00k> I know this is not the place, but figured I'd see if anyone knows how to do this in c# "ticket = ticket.Where(User.IsInRole(c => c.CreatedBy));" This doesnt work.

[07:09:03] <Pal> @MrTool....thanks buddy...
[07:09:17] <Pal> @MrTool....came to know the usage of unshift
[07:24:56] <JohnMcLear_> hey, I have an element that is in a parent div and I have it as $(this) but I want to know how many other elements are before it in the parent element?
[07:25:01] <JohnMcLear_> Obviously I can select it using nth-child
[07:25:27] <JohnMcLear_> but I Figured doing console.log($(this)); would show me something like "nth":"15" or something
[07:26:31] <_rgn> JohnMcLear_: .index()
[07:27:15] <JohnMcLear_> sounds familiar
[07:27:42] <JohnMcLear_> yep
[07:27:44] <JohnMcLear_> thats the one
[07:27:57] <JohnMcLear_> cheers _rgn, knew it was possible
[07:28:13] <JohnMcLear_> head so far up nth- arse i couldn't think past it
[07:29:44] <Darkstar1> Can someone help me with my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/darkstar1/geJ4s/21/ I just want the active header only to be green so that the none active ones revert back to black without closing them manually
[07:30:22] <Darkstar1> right now clicking on another non-active closes the others but keeps the recently close bar green
[07:34:13] <JohnMcLear_> _rgn any why index might always be -1 ?
[07:34:15] <Darkstar1> Anyone?
[07:34:32] <JohnMcLear_> ah nm
[07:34:37] <JohnMcLear_> was due to a race condition ;\
[07:34:39] <JohnMcLear_> hate my life
[07:36:11] * Darkstar1 sighs
[07:36:19] <Darkstar1> Thanks for the help anyways

[07:59:14] <wroathe> aaas: You're trying to emulate Github's file browser?
[07:59:31] <aaas> wroathe yes..the tree slide effect
[08:00:45] <wroathe> aaas: So let me get this right... 1) User clicks on something 2) You make an AJAX request, get back some JSON, and build the next page using that information 3) You slide in that page from the right?
[08:01:53] <aaas> wroathe  pretty much except the json is not a complete page, it's just parsed by the $.ajax sucess: and it replaces part of the page
[08:02:30] <wroathe> aaas: Could you fiddle it?
[08:02:35] <wroathe> aaas: or gist
[08:02:37] <wroathe> Doesn't have to be working
[08:02:43] <aaas> yeah i guess i should try
[08:03:09] <aaas> the problem is that drupal call and it uses jquery and jqueryui so im not totally sure
[08:03:12] <aaas> but i can try
[08:35:11] <rbs> hey, I just wrote a jQuery plugin and published at https://github.com/robsoncombr/jquery.modalLoading - give it a try :)
[08:38:15] <JohnMcLear_> Congrats rbs :)
[08:39:58] <rbs> JohnMcLear_ hey thanks. i`m beginner :)
[08:40:40] <Krambiorix> hi, what's the fastest notation to get all  li elements in a div with class "messages" ?
[08:42:13] <JohnMcLear_> we're all beginners :)
[08:42:35] <Gho5t> $('.messages')
[08:43:01] <Gho5t> or maybe $('#someAncestor').find('.messages');
[08:45:09] <Krambiorix> Gho5t, i mean <div class="messages"><ul><li></li></ul>
[08:45:31] <Gho5t> oh all li sorry
[08:45:32] <Krambiorix> i could do $(".messages").find("li")  but i think i can do it shorter
[08:45:43] <Gho5t> $('.message .li')
[08:45:48] <Gho5t> $('.messages .li')
[08:47:04] <Krambiorix> no
[08:47:09] <Krambiorix> .li is not a class
[08:47:35] <Gho5t> fuck me
[08:47:42] <Gho5t> $('.messages li')
[08:48:12] <Krambiorix> Gho5t, i tried that before i asked... it didn't work
[08:48:21] <mehwork> does that give you all the li's? don't you need to use .first() or wahtever too
[08:48:27] <Krambiorix> and if you're a very cute woman, maybe i would :p
[08:49:58] <Gho5t> that should work
[08:50:05] <Gho5t> if it didn't, you're doing something wrong
[08:50:15] <Gho5t> make sure you're in the document.ready event
[08:51:46] <Krambiorix> hmmm i think it would work but the element is generated after document.ready...
[08:52:16] <Gho5t> kinda doesn't work like that
[08:52:37] <Gho5t> unless you're adding to the dom after
[08:54:17] <Krambiorix> Gho5t, i do
[08:56:12] <Anticom> hi all
[08:56:31] <Anticom> i'm looking for some kind of tokenizer plugin with support for textareas similar to those: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2674466/966530
[08:56:45] <Anticom> thing is, i need to combine the tokens with normal text
[08:56:59] <Anticom> so it would be like "this is some bla bla [TOKEN] and here it goes on"
[08:57:16] <Anticom> anyone knows such plugin?
[08:57:42] <Gho5t> Krambiorix: then you need to search the object you're adding to the dom
[08:57:49] <Gho5t> before or after you add it
[09:00:44] <LogicaLInsanity1> awwyeeeeeeeea
[09:15:25] <Synthead> if I create a trigger for a class of buttons to call a function, how can I figure out the CSS ID of the button that was clicked?
[09:16:38] <myosotis> will $(this).attr('id') inside of the click callback give you what you want?
[09:20:01] <Synthead> myosotis: the click callback, like $('.these-buttons').click(function() { myFunction($(this).attr('id')); }); ?
[09:20:33] <Synthead> myosotis: or is there a way I can do this inside of myFunction ?
[09:24:35] <myosotis> Synthead, http://jsfiddle.net/qkZtY/
[09:41:57] <chinoto> Querying for an the existence of an attribute has lower performance than querying for a class or id, but what about filtering? ($(query) vs $set.filter(filter))
[09:50:39] <aaas> anyone want to take a crack at this one: http://goo.gl/mip8Q  here's a jsfiddle showing the problem http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/1/ wroathe
[09:53:45] <chinoto> aaas: to start with, wrap the element that is being replaced with a div to be used for hiding/showing
[09:55:44] <aaas> chinoto i think im doing this... have a div around the content im replacing and thats what the replacewith acts on
[10:00:31] <chinoto> I need to check your code, but something like "<div id='outer'><div id='inner'></div></div><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var $outer=$('outer').hide({complete:function() {$.post(url,{},function(data) {$('inner').replaceWith(data);$outer.show()},'html')}})//]]></script>"
[10:00:55] <chinoto> might have something wrong in that mess ;P
[10:01:45] <aaas> chinoto if it helps at all you can see the jsfiddle it shows the exact problem with the 'bunchign' im having http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/1/
[10:01:46] <chinoto> I've started doing a polyglot xhtml5 conversion, so that's why I have the commented cdata >.>
[10:05:07] <Tricks> Hey all - question about Jquery UI Menu if anyone has time: I'm using the default nested format of <li> within <ul> which are then potentially within <li> of parent <ul> (nested menu). Within each <li> I have an <a> with a value and its innerHtml is the option text. Soemthing like <li><a href="#" value="23">Choice 23</a></li> -- On the select event for the menu when clicking on one of these options, how can I get the text and value?
[10:08:40] <chinoto> NICE!
[10:08:59] <chinoto> aaas: http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/2/
[10:09:10] <chinoto> I'll have to implement that somewhere
[10:13:00] <aaas> chinoto cool thanks!  i didn't know you could just create a (function()) like that, that was probably my problem....if you have time though, how do I make the button work over and over, how do i reattach the behaviors using jquery (so this is basically where i would put my drupal specific stuff, but i want to do it in the jsfiddle with jquery
[10:13:42] <chinoto> instead of using replacewith, you would want to use the html method on $container
[10:14:00] <chinoto> (I always prepend my jquery instance variables with "$")
[10:14:11] <aaas> chinoto well i want to reattach ..for various reasons i cant use html() ...drupal specific reasons
[10:14:26] <chinoto> xml?
[10:15:24] <chinoto> Unless you or I are misunderstanding something, there shouldn't be any problem with using html...
[10:15:43] <chinoto> especially if replacewith works
[10:16:58] <aaas> chinoto well it works fine in the jquery im sure, but what i mean is my drupal json provides me with a full replacment (including the wrapping tag) not the inside.... so this is my drupal design and i want to reattach the jquery behaviors at the jquery levels when a new elment appears
[10:17:42] <chinoto> ok then it's not me.
[10:18:16] <aaas> chinoto ill have to use .live()
[10:18:21] <aaas> ill look into it
[10:18:23] <chinoto> EH?!?
[10:18:25] <chinoto> NO!
[10:18:33] <aaas> why not?
[10:19:17] <chinoto> it's old, deprecated, and has a better replacement
[10:19:23] <aaas> ok .on()?
[10:19:26] <chinoto> aye
[10:19:51] <aaas> ok ill look into it thanks
[10:20:00] <chinoto> not required
[10:20:53] <chinoto> we have "<container><dynamic></dynamic></container>", what you are trying to do is basically say "$('dynamic').replaceWith(content)". I'm saying you just do "$('container').html(content)"
[10:21:09] <chinoto> Oh, I see now
[10:21:21] <chinoto> you need the content around dynamic still
[10:21:38] <aaas> chinoto yes i understand that completely, what I'm saying is that drupal wont allow me to do that because it provides the json with the wrapper
[10:21:51] <chinoto> so it's actually more like "<container>junk<dynamic></dynamic>junk</container>"
[10:21:54] <aaas> if i did what you said and i keep hitting the button i keep getting more and more nested divs
[10:23:17] <chinoto> aaas: you wouldn't get nested divs unless ur doin it rong
[10:25:24] <chinoto> aaas: http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/3/
[10:26:14] <chinoto> you nest one div deep, but at least you can reuse the jquery variable
[10:27:40] <aaas> ok thank ill have to look into it...i was trying to avoide the container wrapper
[10:27:50] <aaas> but this may be better
[10:32:56] <chinoto> excessive nesting is mostly a worry for developer looking at the produced html, it shouldn't ever matter to a computer (unless thousands of elements deep)
[10:33:38] <aaas> chinoto if html() replaces with new content, are the behaviors of the new content automatically updated?  so for exampel the 'clickme' button is new on the new content, but jquery reattaches this behavior?
[10:34:51] <chinoto> the thing to remember is that there is very litle difference between replaceWith and html
[10:35:41] <aaas> chinoto yes but in both cases something is removed from the dom and put back...and that new thing needs to have jquery attached to the new content...is this ran in html() but not in repalcewith()
[10:35:50] <chinoto> $('elem').after(content).remove() is an equivalent to replaceWith
[10:36:23] <NoiseEee> aaas: event delegation is your friend
[10:36:31] <chinoto> there is nothing to "reattach", the elements created by both methods are entirely unrelated to the old content
[10:36:47] <chinoto> NoiseEee@ aaas: agreed
[10:37:06] <chinoto> but it's drupal stuff, so might not work perfectly
[10:37:16] <chinoto> or be possible
[10:37:26] <aaas> chinoto so im a newbie at this, so maybe my question isn't great...i guess i mean, if i replace content, will the click behavor on 'clickme' work on the second button press with that jsfiddle
[10:38:14] <chinoto> aaas: apparently not, I'll fix it
[10:38:23] <aaas> chinoto ah ok thanks
[10:38:28] <SlexAxton> s5fs: hey bro
[10:39:32] <s5fs> SlexAxton: hi!
[10:40:05] <imdea> Hi, I have one form and when tryint to do this: $('#myform').submit(); it works in all browsers except firefox. any ideas?
[10:41:12] <Baseer> does any body can help me please that where is the syntax error in my this script
[10:41:13] <Baseer> http://pastebin.com/86jQn3c5
[10:41:55] <chinoto> aaas: http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/6/
[10:42:28] <chinoto> if the clickme thing is part of the response, then you'll need to use ... sec
[10:43:11] <Krinkle> Baseer: there is no syntax error
[10:43:12] <shoky> Baseer: i don't see any syntax error. but .live is deprecated/removed
[10:43:19] <aaas> chinoto yeah that the only thing is that it comes from the response
[10:43:52] <Baseer> Yeah, thanks I found the problem, it was with <a href='javascript:void'>
[10:44:11] <jedimind> ...
[10:44:31] <imdea> anyone?
[10:45:02] <chinoto> aaas: http://jsfiddle.net/JPqhz/7/
[10:45:13] <chinoto> there, perfect!
[10:46:09] <aaas> chinoto ok, so since you have to use the on...is there any benefit of using html() and a container v.s. replacewith() without the container?
[10:46:32] <shoky> imdea: is the form part of the DOM?
[10:46:37] <chinoto> aaas: you can reuse the wrapper variable
[10:46:57] <imdea> shoky: of course.
[10:46:58] <shoky> imdea: nevermind, it is if you're using a selector. demo/jsfiddle plz
[10:47:08] <chinoto> aaas: you can reuse the SAME wrapper variable
[10:47:22] <aaas> chinoto i see so if you dont you'll have to update that variable and traverse the dom again?
[10:47:28] <chinoto> aye
[10:48:01] <chinoto> and relying on the response to have the right id isn't ... reliable
[10:48:07] <imdea> shoky, now i found a "hack" that makes it work by typing:  $('#myform').appendTo('body').submit() but then for some reason it doesn't pass the POST parameters to the "form action script"
[10:48:07] <imdea> :S
[10:48:29] <shoky> imdea: uhh definitely demo/jsfiddle
[10:48:54] <aaas> ok.... i was trying to a avoid this because it means I have to rework a bit .... ill think about it but maybe ill do it this way......thanks so much for all your help!
[10:49:39] <chinoto> k, I'm out then (got a job to get back to :D)
[10:49:57] <aaas> chinoto thanks again!
[10:50:35] <imdea> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/uMtGb/
[10:50:58] <shoky> imdea: that's not a demo
[10:51:12] <imdea> wtf?
[10:51:21] <shoky> imdea: there is no form there.
[10:51:47] <imdea> shoky: er.. even putting the form is useless since It will call a php file
[10:51:54] <shoky> imdea: and you didn't include jquery, and you're not calling that book_items function anywhere, etc.
[10:52:11] <DarkGhost`> Hello, for some reason I'm getting .split() isn't a function ?
[10:52:12] <shoky> imdea: doesn't matter if it calls a php, at least i would see the form trying to submit or not
[10:52:52] <imdea> shoky, nevermind, html file is too big to put it there
[10:52:53] <imdea> :s
[10:53:02] <shoky> imdea: reproduce the issue on jsfiddle.. don't need your big html
[10:53:07] <shoky> minimal testcase of the problem
[10:53:18] <shoky> you'll probably solve it while doing that
[10:54:20] <shoky> DarkGhost`: what are you calling it on...
[10:54:41] <DarkGhost`> idk its in a plugin i donwloaded
[10:54:46] <DarkGhost`> http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/demo.html
[10:54:48] <DarkGhost`> works fine for them though
[10:56:09] <imdea> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/uMtGb/1/
[10:57:13] <shoky> imdea: that still does not demonstrate your issue
[10:57:27] <imdea> shoky: now why not?
[10:57:35] <shoky> imdea: you're still not including jquery. you still are not calling book_items. you dont have a #reservar_button element
[10:57:58] <shoky> imdea: make a WORKING testcase, or it's useless
[10:58:03] <DarkGhost`> ;(
[10:59:01] <DarkGhost`> Error: TypeError: $el.data(...).split is not a function | Source File: http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/js/simple-slider.js

[11:00:31] <imdea> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/uMtGb/3/
[11:00:48] <imdea> shoky,  hope this time it's already "working"
[11:00:49] <DarkGhost`> http://privatepaste.com/b1f373ed65
[11:02:15] <shoky> imdea: it's working.. and it's submitting the form, in firefox too.
[11:02:34] <imdea> shoky, well it doesn't work for me. ONLY in firefox.
[11:02:50] <shoky> imdea:  the jsfiddle doesn't work for you? it's not submitting the form?
[11:04:08] <imdea> shoky, in jsfiddle it works, but in my site it doesn't
[11:05:19] <shoky> imdea: i can't help if i don't see the problem..
[11:05:31] <imdea> :s...
[11:05:43] <imdea> well there is certainly an issue with it
[11:05:54] <shoky> imdea: with your site, yeah
[11:06:07] <imdea> shoky: not with my site. if it doesn't work for me, then it doesn't work.
[11:06:13] <imdea> shoky: take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/uMtGb/3/
[11:06:15] <shoky> that's absurd :)
[11:06:42] <shoky> imdea: i did..
[11:07:10] <imdea> shoky, so I don't see what does my site have of "special" to don't work...
[11:07:35] <shoky> imdea: and you think I can see it? at least you have access to your site
[11:12:07] <shoky> DarkGhost`: put a range in your data-slider-range   e.g. slider-range="10,1000"
[11:18:59] <imdea> shoky: I've tested, and this is the situation: it's a shopping cart page, if the person clicks on the button then it's ok and it submit the form.. but if the person clicks on the "remove" image that I have there (which basically what it does is to call the element like $('#foo').delete ) then the submit doesn't work anymore (only in firefox)
[11:20:08] <shoky> imdea: again.. without seeing an actual demo of the problem, or the actual site, i can't help
[11:20:26] <imdea> shoky, ok, "thank you".
[11:20:51] <shoky> idiot
[11:22:55] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[11:23:16] <Germanaz0> I need help, I want to find an alternative to live event of jquery, but using native javascript
[11:25:01] <DarkGhost`> oh, shoky you're right but I already switched sliders lol
[11:26:00] <DarkGhost`> why when I put $(function() {  $( "#slider-range-max" ).slider({}); } it says, slider is not a function but when i remove $(function() it works?
[11:28:01] <shoky> DarkGhost`: sounds weird.. jsfiddle it

[11:30:19] <mantas322> Hi guys
[11:30:24] <mantas322> anyone here?
[11:30:33] <mantas322> im tryign to decipher some jquery syntax
[11:30:36] <chokeamancer> for an animate fuction, what is the "auto" css propertyName?  "" and "auto" appear to do nothing?
[11:30:37] <mantas322> im new to jquery
[11:30:54] <mantas322> can someone kind of help me with a noobish overview of what this line does?
[11:30:55] <mantas322> $container = _.isString(options.content) ? $box.find(options.content) : $(options.content)
[11:31:12] <mantas322> the "?"   is an if conditional
[11:31:18] <chokeamancer> Ternary is ftw?  that's an ifstatement.
[11:31:49] <chokeamancer> yeah, if your options.content are a string, fimd it, else just set it = to the $container
[11:32:15] <DarkGhost`> idk how to work jsfiddle very well shoky
[11:32:44] <imdea> shoky, what?
[11:33:45] <DarkGhost`> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/2/ okay it works on jsfiddle but  not on my site
[11:34:18] <mantas322> thanks choke
[11:34:20] <mantas322> epxlain this
[11:34:20] <mantas322> var $box = $(this),
[11:34:44] <chokeamancer> just setting something to a local variable, most likely to get used later for something (common in ajax requests I suppose)
[11:35:32] <mantas322> okay thanks
[11:35:42] <DarkGhost`> what exactly does $function(){ do
[11:36:09] <chokeamancer> Thats a hell of a question. Meta-lly, it could do everything :3
[11:36:09] <Saaether> $(function() {}) is shortform replacement for document ready
[11:36:19] <chokeamancer> but yup ^^
[11:36:58] <DarkGhost`> THANKS
[11:37:00] <DarkGhost`> oops sorry about caps
[11:37:37] <DarkGhost`> okay, http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/5/ how come that doesn't update the #amount when you scroll?
[11:37:48] <mantas322> so im getting an error for "_" the underscore
[11:38:02] <mantas322> is the underscore something specuial in jquery?
[11:38:10] <mantas322> _.isString
[11:38:31] <chokeamancer> nope, that'd be a typo.  $.isString (although I'm not sure) don't havce the jquery api memorized
[11:38:34] <Saaether> DarkGhost` because you never added anything to update the numbers
[11:39:08] <DarkGhost`> Saaether what do you mean? its in the slide: function
[11:39:22] <Saaether> no.. you set the value once, and thats it
[11:39:30] <Saaether> you dont have anything listening for a change
[11:39:34] <Zitter> hi, does someone know how to display default values (multiple=multiple) with Select2, if someone used it? http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[11:39:40] <DarkGhost`> i thought thats what .slider({ slide: function(event, ui) does
[11:40:20] <DarkGhost`> Saaether I nkow thats not true, because look, same code with just one slider: http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/6/
[11:40:20] <DarkGhost`> and it works
[11:40:30] <Saaether> hmm i was only looking at the bottom val assignment, not familiar with the slider functions
[11:42:38] <Saaether> but your example isnt working because your value of i is lost
[11:42:48] <Saaether> every time it calls that function its looking at amount-5
[11:42:55] <Saaether> which is the last value of i
[11:43:24] <DarkGhost`> it only goes up to 4
[11:43:50] <Saaether> it goes to 5 and then your loop doesnt run because it is greater then 4
[11:44:05] <DarkGhost`> alert(i) only goes to 4?
[11:44:33] <Saaether> DarkGhost` http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/7/
[11:45:19] <DarkGhost`> whatd you change?
[11:45:22] <DarkGhost`> oh
[11:45:24] <DarkGhost`> console.log
[11:45:50] <alicefreak> I am trying to hide the bootstrap modal window on success. But it does not work. I am not getting any error. Here is my code where i've added bootstrap hide statement (https://dpaste.de/0v6jy/#L25). Can someone please help?  thanks
[11:46:06] <DarkGhost`> Saaether where does that console log go?
[11:46:26] <Saaether> it displays the value in the console
[11:46:39] <DarkGhost`> what console, I'm looknig in firebug and web dev and don't see anything
[11:46:49] <DarkGhost`> nvm now it is
[11:46:50] <DarkGhost`> sorry
[11:47:55] <thang> alicefreak: does running that line with the modal active via the console do anything?
[11:48:06] <DarkGhost`> why does it only go up to 5 inside that slide function?
[11:48:10] <DarkGhost`> not outside the slide?
[11:48:12] <naeluh> having a weird issue ?
[11:48:18] <saba> Any ideas why this http://jsfiddle.net/bE6UR/1/ throws a permission denied in IE10? Please note that this is Jquery 1.8.0. I'm still curious why.
[11:49:27] <Saaether> DarkGhost` http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/10/ here if you want your example to work
[11:49:58] <alicefreak> thang: I don't see. Its printing whole page in console.
[11:50:25] <alicefreak> thang: Alert popup works just fine.
[11:51:45] <thang> alicefreak: $('#submit_buyer_form').modal('hide') =>  prints the page in console?
[11:52:16] <alicefreak> thang: ok let me print
[11:52:42] <DarkGhost`> why does i get lost inside that function Saaether? thank you btw.
[11:53:02] <mantas322> You guys where wrong
[11:53:22] <mantas322> jk
[11:53:35] <mantas322> it was underscore.js that was using these _.find   etc types
[11:53:49] <alicefreak> thang: I get this https://dpaste.de/8kHGn/
[11:54:15] <Saaether> DarkGhost` when the script initially runs it goes through your function increasing the value of i up to 5. then when you slide the bar your telling it to use the value of i. which is now at 5
[11:56:41] <alicefreak> thang: Problem solved. I was providing wrong attribute id. Sorry it was my mistake.
[11:56:43] <thang> alicefreak: are you sure thats the right selector? the modal should be a div
[11:56:45] <DarkGhost`> hmm, well then why when i console.log(i) outside of that slide function it doesn't show 5 ever?
[11:57:24] <DarkGhost`> and how come I can't just change it to i <= 4 or something
[11:57:27] <DarkGhost`> sorry i'm just trying to understand
[11:59:42] <Saaether> ok lets start with how a for loop works, in your example you start at 1, and you want it to run while it is less then 5. so its goes i=1, is it less then 5? yup go ahead, i+1, ...., i=4, is it less then 5? yup go ahead, i+1 is it less then 5? nope end loop
[11:59:47] <Saaether> leaving the value of i at 5
[12:01:28] <Saaether> now, the slide function inside your slider function is called every time you slide one of the bars, it doesnt matter what i was when the slider was setup, the function is being called when you slide the bar
[12:01:42] <Saaether> so i will always be 5 after the fact
[12:02:15] <alicefreak> thang: you are right. I am using wrong selector.
[12:02:22] <alicefreak> thang: thanks :-)
[12:05:19] <shoky> saba: not getting any error there..
[12:21:36] <DarkGhost`> gotcha Saaether thank you.
[12:22:02] <DarkGhost`> but now when I'm calling .slider( it's sayign it's not a function, heres just the one line of code 	$('.my-input-'+i).slider( "value", $(this).val());
[12:25:27] <shoky> DarkGhost`:  .slider('option', 'value', $(this).val() )   probably
[12:26:04] <DarkGhost`> hmm? i'm pretty sure the way I have it is the right way to change it
[12:26:08] <DarkGhost`> its just being weird telling me slider isnt a function
[12:26:18] <shoky> o
[12:26:21] <DarkGhost`> what do you mean by 'option', 'value', ?
[12:26:33] <shoky> nevermind, i see that value is both an option and a "method"
[12:26:42] <DarkGhost`> gotcha
[12:26:56] <DarkGhost`> let me try and put it in jfiddle
[12:30:25] <DarkGhost`> http://jsfiddle.net/Q4QV5/13/ shoky
[12:30:47] <Saaether> DarkGhost` no errors on that example
[12:31:05] <DarkGhost`> i know
[12:31:06] <DarkGhost`> but hold on
[12:31:13] <DarkGhost`> for some reason on my site it does give an error
[12:31:43] <DarkGhost`> why do you think?
[12:31:55] <DarkGhost`> I would show, but you have ot lgoin and bla bla
[12:32:12] <Saaether> well if its saying slider isnt a function i would assume you dont have the jq-ui js included on your page
[12:32:40] <Saaether> which would be where the function is defined
[12:32:44] <DarkGhost`> literally works 4 lines above

[12:33:15] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to find the absolute x,y position of an item on the page, even if it's relatively positioned to it's container?

[12:35:38] <tomasm-> Saaether, I meant relative to the document. and I found offset()
[12:38:01] <utroda> I have 2 events, on the same element(s), in one method i need to do a return false, but not stop the other method from firing any ideas on how to do this? I tried .off() but so far no luck.
[12:38:03] <DarkGhost`> :(
[12:38:10] <ZippyV> Are there any best practices or code patterns to use when making an web app with jQuery Mobile?
[12:44:58] <Saaether> DarkGhost` im not sure why your getting the error on your page and not on fiddle, i can say your code confuses me.. you're setting the value of your sliders based on the value of a text box.. and then right after that your setting the value of the textbox to the value of the slider?
[12:49:33] <DarkGhost`> Saaether I know, I figured it out and this code is terrible I do apologize.

[13:23:46] <shoky> simple (i hope) CSS question - how do you get the text to be aligned at the top-left corner of the div?  http://jsfiddle.net/4CZUR/1/
[13:24:29] <shoky> guess it has to do with line-height but i don't really know the right value
[13:25:51] <jedimind> should maybe ask in #css ?
[13:26:10] <shoky> true
[13:26:42] <blindMoe> shoky: adjust your line-height
[13:26:49] <shoky> blindMoe: to what..
[13:27:18] <blindMoe> the problem you are going to run in to is that Capital letters are taller so if it is all lower case it will never quite fit the way you are expecting it to
[13:27:21] <scotdb> JQuery validation question : I need four fields to either all have input or none of them have input.   Is this something built-in (or available via plugin) or am I on my own ?
[13:27:47] <blindMoe> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/4CZUR/4/
[13:28:32] <shoky> blindMoe: thanks.. but i need to know how to get the right line-height according to the font-size.. if you change the font-size in your fiddle it will no longer be aligned
[13:29:06] <shoky> i don't mind a javascript solution
[13:29:35] <blindMoe> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/4CZUR/5/
[13:29:45] <scotdb> Is it JQuery validate groups ?
[13:29:46] <blindMoe> I don't think javascript will help you
[13:31:21] <shoky> blindMoe: that seems to work fine, thanks. can't say i understand it though
[13:31:56] <napster> Can I bind click event to all widgets with the same id at once?
[13:32:00] <blindMoe> shoky: line-heights are interesting in CSS... they are good to play with and learn how to use though
[13:32:14] <blindMoe> napster: you mean jquery ui widgets?
[13:32:31] <napster> blindMoe: jquery mobile button
[13:32:44] <blindMoe> sure
[13:32:56] <napster> blindMoe: mind telling me how?
[13:33:13] <blindMoe> same way you would bind to anything.. the buttons are just elements
[13:33:16] <napster> blindMoe: $("#btn-camera").bind('click',.... works for the firsy one
[13:33:25] <napster> *first one
[13:33:28] <blindMoe> napster: multiple elements can not have the same ID
[13:33:32] <blindMoe> only one ID per page
[13:33:39] <blindMoe> you need to switch them to classes
[13:34:08] <napster> what if I need to bind a function to click events on all widgets with id "camera"
[13:34:12] <napster> blindMoe: ^^
[13:47:20] <scotdb> It isn't JQuery validate groups (that only controls where an error message appears for a group of fields)

[14:55:43] <ShrtSong> Heya
[14:57:06] <ShrtSong> I've "finally" managed to get jQuery.ajax() to work with my application in IE9.  Unfortunately, it's failing now with every other browser.  I'm using jsonp for the datatype, and returning the callback + ({...}) as expected.  I've been digging around and having very little luck in getting this to work with firefox/chrome in particular. Any suggestions?
[15:00:30] <myosotis> that's crazy, I always have the opposite problem
[15:02:26] <blindMoe> ento
[15:02:44] <blindMoe> err scratch that ... ;)
[15:06:26] <ShrtSong> Okay, well, I managed to get it work with IE9, IE10, Firefox, Safari, and Opera... It is still failing with Chrome
[15:07:19] <ShrtSong> The change I made was revert the original url which was https://127.0.0.1:9992 "back" to https://localhost:9992 (originally, I had to use the IP to get IE10 to work, but now that appears to be fixed since I switched to jsonp).
[15:27:05] <smart1> hi there, when i run an ajax request at document ready i could not append the content. any idea why ? i think this will be an beginner question :)
[15:32:11] <thujone> post it on jsfiddle, smart1
[15:32:22] <thujone> do you see an error?
[15:32:40] <thujone> in the javascript console?
[15:34:53] <smart1> thujoe where can i see the console? you think about firebug f.e? no, there are none
[15:36:20] <smart1> the idea is to load just some text from a post request
[15:36:47] <smart1> but i could not read the answers with get.
[15:37:17] <smart1> exactly i want to reload 2 website in some iframes.
[15:48:16] <jax> hello
[15:48:34] <jax> i'm using a $.ajax() request and for some reason, it is opening the response in window.location
[15:53:26] <jax> ah duh
[15:56:12] <jax> hm no
[15:58:43] <jax> why is the request always loading in the browser >;/
[16:00:15] <shoky> `p @ jax
[16:00:37] <shoky> ?p @ jax
[16:00:37] <bot-t> jax, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:01:17] <shoky> ShrtSong: still need help?
[16:10:01] <jax> do .submit handlers go inside document.ready?
[16:11:34] <shoky> jax: it won't hurt probably. document.ready is for making sure the elements you're selecting are in the DOM
[16:12:11] <shoky> jax: so if you do  $('#myform').submit...  you'd want #myform to already be in the DOM
[16:13:17] <Draxelis> shoky,  what the best way to align div Bd   vertically in div c http://jsfiddle.net/28d9n/2/ ?
[16:13:45] <Draxelis> I need to align dynamically, because parent div is responsive
[16:14:21] <jax> gah going to need a fiddle
[16:15:31] <shoky> Draxelis: top: 50%  and margin-top: -25px;    (minus half the height)
[16:16:06] <shoky> Draxelis: er and position:absolute
[16:16:07] <tw2113> what if the height gets bigger than 50px?
[16:16:07] <Draxelis> the height is changing
[16:16:22] <tw2113> vertical centering has always been a bitch
[16:16:27] <shoky> then you change the margin-top ;]
[16:16:34] <Draxelis> shoky,  manually?
[16:16:36] <jax> why is this trying to open the page in the window? http://jsfiddle.net/9XmhR/
[16:16:37] <Draxelis> :)
[16:16:48] <Draxelis> shoky,  u mean via media queries?
[16:17:12] <shoky> Draxelis: manually.  with newer CSS3 stuff (thats hardly supported yet afaik)  there are better ways
[16:17:13] <jax> on form submit
[16:17:28] <jax> ugh
[16:17:29] <shoky> Draxelis: other ways are using table layouts... dont ask me about that tho :P
[16:17:40] <Draxelis> ok
[16:17:43] <jax> maybe i should remove the # from id :D
[16:17:57] <Draxelis> vertical align seems like a basic thing, but achieving this is damn hard
[16:17:59] <ShrtSong> shoky, I somehow managed to fix it! :D
[16:18:14] <ShrtSong> So the problem... Yes... the problem...
[16:18:21] <ShrtSong> Sorry, Went off to have a minor celebration
[16:18:28] <ShrtSong> Now I need to figure out WHAT I did to fix it. :C
[16:18:29] <shoky> heh
[16:19:27] <ShrtSong> Okay. So, the issue was incredibly trivial. I'm using jetty for the http listener (it's embedded in my application).  The problem was that my jsonp result was ({'result':'ok'}), which, you'd think is totally fine, right?
[16:19:32] <ShrtSong> Worked in every other browser after all
[16:19:40] <shoky> no that's not totally fine..
[16:19:44] <ShrtSong> Except json's standard is to use double-quotes, not single-quotes
[16:19:45] <shoky> missing the callback name
[16:19:49] <shoky> and the double-quotes yes
[16:19:58] <ShrtSong> Well aside from the callback (I don't know what the callback is. >.> How would I make that up?!)
[16:20:19] <shoky> you don't make it up. it's sent as a parameter
[16:20:19] <ShrtSong> If the callback was missing, every other browser would fail. ;p
[16:20:34] <shoky> the client makes it up
[16:20:58] <ShrtSong> Anyway, yah, double-quotes. ONLY in chrome tho. And this was the day AFTER I was just telling someone "using single-quotes for json results is WRONG! Bad! Don't ever do it!" and I ended up doing it because I got the whole: "Pfft. What a nerd. Who cares?" response. :c
[16:22:09] <shoky> i didn't think other browsers allowed single quotes
[16:22:25] <shoky> wait that's not even browser related
[16:22:38] <shoky> eh nvm
[16:24:04] <ShrtSong> Yah, it is. ;) Tho I've only ran into this situation once before when I was learning about json. I was mucking around with json result types, but I ran into errors I couldn't understand. The double-quotes was one of them. And I remember using chrome back then too. :)
[16:24:26] <ShrtSong> Anyway, thanks for offering to help, shoky. I appreciate it. :)
[16:24:53] <shoky> ;]
[16:25:04] <ShrtSong> Home time. take care. :)

[16:55:26] <snover> it’s beforeunload, not onbeforenload
[16:55:31] <dogmatic69> I debug just before that line and it shows, so it should be registered.
[16:55:40] <dogmatic69> ah. damn stack overflow
[16:56:21] <dogmatic69> snover: thanks, has it changed or something? A lot of forums / SO etc state bind('onbefore...
[16:56:43] <dogmatic69> works now any how. thanks
[16:58:08] <dylan9o4> snover: do you have an idea of how I should go about it?
[17:08:57] <shoky> Moleboy: here now
[17:10:23] <duramater> if unload is deprecated, what do i use instead?
[17:10:30] <shoky> dylan9o4: you might be looking for .map

[17:13:19] <Moleboy> shoky: forget I said anything. xD I gotta run
[17:13:20] <Moleboy> thanks though!

[19:34:34] <oste> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[19:34:40] <oste> I am wondering how to change the download location
[19:34:44] <oste> .files
[19:35:08] <oste> it seems that it has to be inside the form
[19:35:12] <oste> I would like to place it outside
[19:38:50] <SDr> oste, what do you mean by "outside the form"?
[19:39:10] <SDr> you mean position the button to someplace else, or HTML-wise move the element outside of the form>
[19:39:12] <SDr> ?
[19:39:21] <oste> SDr: by default the downloaded images are placed inside the form
[19:39:41] <oste> might need to look at the UI file
[19:40:12] <SDr> oste, ah, that's a simple div, you can put it anywhere
[19:40:37] <oste> not from what I am seeing
[19:40:41] <oste> it must be placed inside the form
[19:40:57] <oste> by default atleast
[19:41:14] <oste> otherwise the download files never get placed on the page
[19:41:26] <oste> i.e., the plugin cannot find the .files div
[19:44:46] <oste> SDr https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload-ui.js#L58
[19:44:49] <oste> have to define that
[19:54:14] <onenine90> kind of confused as to what this accomplishes:   $('.knob').val(ang).trigger('change');
[19:54:50] <onenine90> Does it change the value  of the element with class "knob" and then simulate a click on that element?
[19:55:28] <sacho> It triggers a change event, not a click.
[19:59:05] <onenine90> kk
[19:59:09] <onenine90> thx

[21:34:16] <potatoZoom> alrighty
[21:35:25] <potatoZoom> I'm putting a whole bunch of checkboxes in table row <form><chkbox></form>. And I'm trying to make it to that a click/tap on the row will check the corresponding checkbox
[21:35:41] <potatoZoom> toggle, rather
[21:36:26] <potatoZoom> it's not checking the box correctly, however. I've called 'trigger('create')
[21:38:13] <Cork> potatoZoom: $('table').on('click touchstart', 'tr', function(event) { var chk = $(this).find('input[type="checkbox"]') if(chk.is(event.target)) { return; }; chk.click(); });
[21:39:18] <Validatorian> Ahoy. Anyone have a tutorial or advice on creating a single-page site (content replaced with external content) using jQuery? I don't believe that sending HTML from the backend via Ajax is the ideal way to do it, but that's all that's coming to mind
[21:39:23] <Cork> potatoZoom: little warning though, that is how i would solve it in jquery, i don't use jquery mobile
[21:39:54] <potatoZoom> thanks cork, I'll look into that. I should've tried .click(), oops
[21:40:10] <Cork> potatoZoom: or .trigger('click') (same thing)
[21:40:39] <Cork> Validatorian: as long as you only send the page fragment that is needed, that is the most efficient way
[21:40:51] <Cork> *then that is the
[21:41:22] <Validatorian> Cork: That's what I would do, yea -- just the content that needs to be in the container, not the header/footer that is already on the page
[21:41:46] <Cork> Validatorian: ya
[21:42:22] <Cork> Validatorian: sending chunks of html and replacing the part in the page is really efficient
[21:42:39] <Cork> compared to ex. sending the content as json and generating the dom from that
[21:43:03] <Cork> browsers has optimized for parsing html streams so it is really fast
[21:43:26] <Validatorian> alright, thanks Cork
[21:43:47] <potatoZoom> look up .load()
[21:44:08] <potatoZoom> the first arg is the URL, the 2nd is a selector iirc of the page being loaded
[21:44:25] <Cork> potatoZoom: no the second part is what you DON'T want to do
[21:44:36] <Cork> cause that means sending the entire page
[21:44:50] <potatoZoom> sorry, don't remember the API that well :)
[21:44:53] <Cork> you want the server to handle picking out the fragment, and then just sending that part
[21:45:06] <Cork> potatoZoom: its .load('url <selector>')
[21:45:13] <potatoZoom> yeah, that, my bad
[21:45:19] <Cork> and the <selector> part is what should be avoided
[22:14:23] <potatoZoom> dammit Cork, thanks :) it works
[22:14:51] <potatoZoom> tried the whole 'prop('checked') thing, and it wasn't sticking
[22:22:27] <potatoZoom> even answers another problem I had that I didn't ask about heh
[22:22:48] <Cork> those are the best, two for one deals! :D
[22:23:22] <alleZSoyez> hello, I'm having some issues changing the css of elements containing a certain value. I can't get it to register it using :contains or text(). the browser is outright ignoring the code. could someone take a look at this please? if my line-counter is correct (it often isn't) it's line 36 http://jsfiddle.net/xqD25/4/
[22:23:42] <tw2113> hey all! did you know you can do jQuery without all the bloat that the jQuery library gives you? it's this new syntax called javascript. No 3rd party file includes needed
[22:24:49] <potatoZoom> side effects include: dealing with browser inconsistencies
[22:24:51] <Cork> alleZSoyez: your only comparing the first td
[22:25:14] <clueless7> Cork: you're*
[22:25:22] <tw2113> it's good for you. puts hair on your chest potatoZoom
[22:25:31] <Cork> heh
[22:42:10] <TvL2386> Hi guys, how does rails know which view helper module it should use? I'm having a method defined in multiple view helper modules with the same name, and rails seems to be confused which one it should pick. I thought it would load the helper based on the controller class
[22:42:32] <Cork> TvL2386: wrong channel
[22:42:48] <TvL2386> oh darn!
[22:42:54] <TvL2386> lol thx Cork
[22:43:15] <TvL2386> it's still early for me
[22:58:20] <Eviltwin> CSS always surprises me
[22:58:44] <Eviltwin> I was trying to make this thing that would feed little circles for a simulation
[22:59:09] <Eviltwin> And I wanted to pull one at a time and have the rest just sit there
[22:59:27] <Eviltwin> So I started with this: http://jsfiddle.net/FsVMe/
[22:59:51] <Eviltwin> It pulls out the first ball as far as I want but when the next one hits the starting position, it just stops
[22:59:56] <Eviltwin> Which is just an added bonus
[23:02:20] <lemonsparrow> :)
[23:05:06] <lenswipee> I press 'Run' and it does nothing.
[23:05:24] <shoky> well, i don't find it surprising that the first is affected differently than the rest.. what's a bit surprising is is that the others moved right at all
[23:05:52] <Eviltwin> I think it makes sense that they're moved to the right
[23:06:07] <Eviltwin> Because the reason they're not all stacked on top of each other is the others pushing back
[23:06:22] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: Use the slider in the bottom right pane
[23:07:15] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: FYI, the slider does not work in IE9.
[23:08:22] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: It's jQuery UI's slider
[23:08:48] <shoky> lenswipee: it's a jsfiddle bug
[23:08:57] <shoky> SCRIPT5: Access is denied.
[23:09:01] <shoky> jquery-2.0.2.js, line 1378 character 2
[23:09:23] <lenswipee> okay
[23:09:28] <shoky> well. i think that's jsfiddle's fault, anyways
[23:45:00] <unnu> why the hell wouldn't my inputs get inserted into the dom?
[23:45:09] <unnu> im using a form and .appending a input to it
[23:45:14] <unnu> but when i try to post the form
[23:45:21] <unnu> the new data isn't posted
[23:45:59] <aaas> is there anyway to detect that the back button is pressed (v.s forward), in particular to detect that if the user jumps back 5 positions in their history to return that number 5?
[23:47:18] <unnu> aaas, i think data-rel=back might work
[23:47:28] <unnu> with a counter
[23:48:01] <aaas> unnu ill look into it thanks
[23:48:17] <unnu> $('[data-rel=back]').live('click', function(){ counter +=1} });
[23:48:20] <unnu> try that
[23:48:26] <unnu> set up the counter var first tho :P
[23:49:09] <aaas> unnu is that for a custom back button or the browser back button, or maybe they're the same
[23:49:31] <unnu> a custom back button should call the browser's back button
[23:49:39] <unnu> same code anyway
[23:49:43] <unnu> unless your using ajax
[23:49:48] <unnu> then things get crazy
[23:49:51] <unnu> but it may be easir
[23:50:26] <aaas> i just don't have a data-rel=back markup so this should catch a browser back button click?
[23:50:47] <unnu> hrmmm
[23:51:08] <unnu> i don't know how to send data to the previous page other than posting it
[23:51:34] <aaas> yeah so i am using ajax so all i relaly need is that click
[23:52:42] <kishore> Hi..  I tried the jquery mobile select box but it does't work correctly.The select options are displayed prior to clicking select options. How do i get rid of this . Here is the image which shows how the page look when the page is loaded http://www.dumpt.com/img/links.php?file=nnspmzqcia1l1gttbweg.png
[23:57:05] <aaas> if anyone is familar with history.js and wants to take a crack at this one i'd be greatful: https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/issues/290
