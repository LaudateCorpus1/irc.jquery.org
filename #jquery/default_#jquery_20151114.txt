[00:40:37] <devz> Hi guys, how do I keep the wheel animating, select a winner and then have the wheel animate to the winner? http://jsfiddle.net/b4muwvwt/
[00:41:43] <devz> while animating, go to number that is in "move to" but do it while animating.
[03:06:46] <jop008> when I have this on my page 33 times <input name='4620_buildingconstruction_foto' id='4620_buildingconstruction_foto' type="file" accept="audio/*,video/*,image/*" capture="camera" multiple>
[03:07:07] <jop008> for 33 items Chrome and Firefox quit
[03:07:24] <jop008> when I remove audio and video it is going well
[03:08:25] <Uhkis> if you have that exact line 33 times on your page,  your html is totally invalid
[03:09:31] <jop008> why?
[03:09:40] <jop008> all ids are unique
[03:09:59] <Uhkis> names too?
[03:10:04] <jop008> yes
[03:10:10] <Uhkis> good
[03:15:25] <jop008> on windows chrome it is okay
[03:16:12] <jop008> so what to do?
[03:16:34] <Uhkis> not use that?
[03:16:48] <jop008> It is a requirement
[06:38:24] <groton> how to install the docs of jquery locally? Is there a package for npm?

[09:53:20] <CBenni> oh looks like they ran out of disk space...
[10:38:55] <Kev-> I've been looking at javascript templating engines, but am a little lost on what to use. Is there a templating engine/library that's more used than others?
[10:39:18] <Kev-> So I don't use too much time on something that I'm going to need to ditch because nobody uses it :)
[10:53:17] <Nasp> Use whatever you like
[10:53:21] <Nasp> How many who uses it doesn't matter
[11:33:45] <Kev-> Well it does if you want to collaborate

[18:00:20] <VectorX> hi, on this page when looking at it in Internet Explorer, and you scroll up, the iframe goes over the menu, is there a fix for it, i searched but non of the solutions i found seemed to work, http://bit.ly/1PHfa7v
[18:00:52] <johndoe2> VectorX sounds like z-index type stuff. css.
[18:01:39] <VectorX> johndoe2 im glad you feel you know what the issue is, do you mind taking a quick look and letting me know what i need to do
[18:01:51] <derstrom> VectorX: What version of IE?
[18:01:58] <johndoe2> VectorX I can try. I have to boot up a windows virtual machine. what's the version of ie?
[18:02:00] <VectorX> any, but im testing with 11
[18:02:29] <VectorX> thanks
[18:02:43] <VectorX> its fine in any other browser
[18:03:02] <VectorX> ie, the pdf goes behind the header when you scroll the window
[18:03:47] <johndoe2> VectorX that PDF is trying to download on IE11. But I do see the frame on top of the menu
[18:03:59] <johndoe2> the download probably has to do with the absence of adobe reader on my system
[18:04:44] <VectorX> well if the iframe goes above the header then you can test it, if you can get it to go under that would be great
[18:06:22] <shoky> VectorX it's because of the pdf plugin. there's the same issue with flash
[18:08:18] <VectorX> shoky well i got it working with flash, just cant do it with pdf
[18:08:37] <johndoe2> VectorX ok so there's a bunch of z-index assigned to most of the parent elements
[18:08:42] <johndoe2> what you want to do is go through your css
[18:08:55] <johndoe2> and remove all the unnecessary z-index statements. or comment them all out
[18:08:59] <johndoe2> then set your PDF to -1
[18:09:03] <johndoe2> that will bring it under
[18:09:12] <johndoe2> then mess with z-index for the menu and items that need to be on top o fit
[18:09:15] <johndoe2> of it*
[18:09:20] <VectorX> ok
[18:09:23] <shoky> don't think that'll help any
[18:09:42] <VectorX> do you have any recomendations shoky
[18:09:54] <shoky> nope
[18:09:57] <johndoe2> shoky if you have a better idea, definitely go for it, that's all I got :D
[18:13:07] <VectorX> i deleted all the z-indexes and set the iframe{z-index : -1}  still the same
[18:13:53] <johndoe2> too bad I didn't take a screenshot
[18:13:58] <johndoe2> hold on I'll play with it again
[18:15:01] <VectorX> its got your settings now if that would help
[18:21:12] <johndoe2> VectorX is that a plugin?
[18:21:53] <VectorX> no plugins, iframe and pdf as src, and will use the browser addon to view pdf if you have it
[18:22:48] <johndoe2> shoky was right, it seems IE has issues with plugins and flash embeds in iframes. One way to fix it is to set wmode to transparent
[18:23:10] <VectorX> yeah that only work for flash
[18:24:11] <johndoe2> VectorX then I would try looking for a JS PDF viewer
[18:24:34] <VectorX> ok
[18:24:40] <VectorX> thanks for taking a look
[18:25:00] <VectorX> i just added a object tag and its still the same
[18:25:21] <VectorX> i think the best bet would be to detect ie and add a link to download
[18:26:49] <johndoe2> I'm just amazed I can't re-create what I did
[18:27:13] <johndoe2> tbh, too many z-index settings to keep track of, so there's too many possibilities
[18:27:47] <VectorX> i added back the z-indexes
[18:28:16] <VectorX> it seems like a problem, i was hoping someone here would have possibly solved it
[18:32:11] <flavorking> hey guys, when you import, when do you need to use .js and not?
[18:32:33] <taplar> huh?  you use .js if it's the file extension
[18:32:48] <taplar> denoting that it is a javascript file
[18:33:00] <flavorking> well i see a lot of times there is no file extension
[18:33:24] <taplar> *shrug* if the file doesn't have an extension, then leave it off
[18:33:40] <flavorking> no, the file has an extension but the import statement doesn't use a file extension
[18:33:44] <flavorking> does it default to .js extension?
[18:33:57] <taplar> never tried
[18:34:35] <flavorking> anyone with knowledge...?
[18:34:56] <taplar> just tried it, it didn't default the .js
[18:35:00] <taplar> so no
[18:35:18] <flavorking> it def works
[18:35:23] <flavorking> maybe files didnt have export statements
[18:35:25] <VectorX> johndoe2 i went with http://docs.google.com/gview?url= in the iframe
[18:35:58] <VectorX> thanks again for your help and shoky aswell
[18:36:16] <johndoe2> cool that means google is sending the proper wmode
[18:36:46] <VectorX> i guess, i dont know what it doing what it works ;)
[18:36:54] <VectorX> s/what/but/
[18:36:54] <b-ot> Correction, <VectorX> i guess, i dont know but it doing but it works ;)
[18:37:07] <VectorX> interesting
[18:37:14] <VectorX> ls
[18:37:16] <johndoe2> haha awesome
[18:37:49] <VectorX> yes | rm -r *
[18:38:01] <VectorX> guess the bot only picks up selective stuff, hehe
[18:38:22] <johndoe2> no it picks up regex replacement style corrections
[18:38:34] <johndoe2> for exampl
[18:38:38] <johndoe2> s/exampl/example
[18:38:38] <b-ot> Correction, <johndoe2> for example
[18:38:42] <VectorX> right
[18:39:37] <VectorX> i hope google doesnt stop the service
[18:40:07] <johndoe2> if that happens you can always implement one line of JS after you embed the plugin's js.
[18:40:43] <VectorX> yeah
[18:40:50] <johndoe2> nothing scary, and if you want to minimize the impact on page load time you can throw that js file on a CDN (there's plenty of free ones)
[18:46:05] <johndoe2> right I remember why I came here :) how would one stop an .animate({scrollTop: offset}, 500) on page scroll?
[18:46:23] <derstrom> You can use .stop()
[18:46:55] <derstrom> this stops any transitions that are occurring on the element it is applied to, e.g. $('#elem').stop()
[18:47:33] <johndoe2> okay, sounds good. thank you derstrom
[18:48:45] <derstrom> However if you are applying .stop() on a .scroll() event, it will be fired simply by executing animate({scrollTop: offset})
[18:54:30] <johndoe2> I see
[19:05:31] <derstrom> As to how you go around that, I don't know :), perhaps there is a way by knowing what propagated the scroll() event, or by assigning a class to the body tag while the animate() event is being fired, and checking if that class exists when you want to stop() the scroll
[19:05:51] <derstrom> and when the animate() has finished, removing the class from body
[19:14:05] <johndoe2> yeah I need to think this through
[19:16:41] <johndoe2> basically I'm scrolling to the next/previous h1 tag on the page, but I can't get the ongoing animation to stop when the person taps the same container or scrolls it. The browser just waits for the user to stop interacting and then it snaps to the h1 it going to go to if it wasn't interrupted by the user interaction.
[19:20:37] <derstrom> johndoe2: can you paste your code on jsfiddle.net? can't help you unless I can see it in action and the code you are currently using
[19:21:31] <johndoe2> yup
[19:27:32] <johndoe2> derstrom http://jsfiddle.net/t2qya8gy/ here it is
[19:30:48] <johndoe2> odd part is I should be getting a lot of console.log output from the scroll bind upon scrolling at any time but that's not getting triggered and I'm not sure why
[19:33:41] <johndoe2> ok I think I got it. I shouldn't have the scroll listener on body and html, I should just have it on the container, on click rather than scroll (because you'd have to tap to scroll anyway)
[19:34:12] <derstrom> Just a moment, I am going through your code.
[19:34:12] <johndoe2> that works :) thank you for looking at it derstrom.
[19:34:22] <johndoe2> ok ty
[19:34:27] <derstrom> but you do need to change $('html,body').scroll() to $(document).scroll()
[19:37:10] <johndoe2> you got it
[19:43:24] <derstrom> johndoe2: As I say I'm not really sure how you can stop the scroll animation from taking place, because the scroll event is fired when a user scrolls down on the page, and when your animate() is fired.
[19:43:35] <derstrom> Someone else may be able to help you though.
[19:44:52] <derstrom> So effectively if you stop() the animation in a scroll() event, it'll stop animate() as well as any user action that triggers the event
[19:47:30] <johndoe2> exactly
[19:47:38] <johndoe2> not a desired outcome
[19:48:04] <johndoe2> but if you bind it to a click/tap it's actually doing what it should - stopping scrolling
[19:48:20] <derstrom> Well I have had the same issue in my own project, and I couldn't find a way to find out the element that propagates the event. If you can find that out, you have a solution on your hands.
[19:48:22] <johndoe2> it's the default behavior for mobile browsers to stop scrolling when a user taps the screen
[19:48:41] <johndoe2> so all I'm doing is duplicating the behavior programmatically
[19:49:08] <derstrom> Yes, if you want to stop the scrolling from taking place on click(), then it's fine. But if you want to stop animate() from continuing if a user scrolls up or down the page; then that's where the problem lies.
[19:49:23] <johndoe2> true
[19:49:55] <johndoe2> all I can think of is a way to only trigger the .stop() when a user scrolls more than say... 20 pixels
[19:50:04] <johndoe2> but that gets very complicated, quick :)
[19:50:25] <derstrom> that would inhibit the same issue as before, if you execute stop() on scroll()
[19:50:39] <derstrom> because there is no differentiation; the same event is fired
[19:50:45] <derstrom> First thing I would recommend you look into is whether you can find out the element that is responsible for propagating the scroll event.
[19:50:58] <derstrom> It must be possible some way or another; I can't see it not being possible.
[19:51:27] <johndoe2> meaning which element calls scrollMe() ?
[19:52:54] <isthisreallife> hi
[19:53:33] <isthisreallife> https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165456208/     why $('.btn_profile_action') returns null?
[19:53:52] <isthisreallife> there is a div with class btn_profile_action
[19:54:32] <derstrom> That's a question Valve can probably answer better than we can.
[19:55:54] <derstrom> johndoe2: Ugh, I don't know, it's complicated :-)
[19:58:34] <derstrom> johndoe2: Sorry I can't help you find a solution.
[20:01:06] <johndoe2> derstrom you did actually. Thank you. In my case I'm okay with stopping any animation on click() rather than scroll(). I'm more worried about mobile visitors, it's a bit annoying to have your browser do whatever it wants when you're used to it stopping the scroll animation on tap (if you swipe to scroll it has that inertial scroll animation that immediately halts once you tap).
[20:02:55] <derstrom> johndoe2: You're welcome :)
[20:03:01] <derstrom> Best of luck with your project.
[20:03:19] <johndoe2> It's appreciated and needed hehe :)
[20:04:14] <isthisreallife> im trying to do some basic jquery and it doesnt work on steamcommunity.com page
[20:05:28] <derstrom> You can put your own JavaScript code on your SteamCommunity page?
[20:08:06] <johndoe2> isthisreallife $(".btn_profile_action") selects an element that has the class called "btn_profile_action" and there's no such class on that page you linked. Unless you're logged in and get some more elements than regular visitors get :P
[20:09:14] <derstrom> I am still perplexed as to how Valve would allow users to put their own JavaScript code on their profile. Huge security risk doing that.
[20:09:57] <johndoe2> yeah, very unlikely
[21:38:24] <unrecited> what ever happened to flash? i was thinking of doing a site for local artists, all audio players and such - html5 supports it now although I was thinking js.. but what ever happened to flash? thats a no no now?
[22:20:15] <johndoe2> unrecited flash is not supported on most mobile devices, and it's being phased out by google, mozilla, and possibly others that I have yet to hear about. Modern browsers (mobile ones included) can handle the simple task of playing a track, and much much more. What's even better, you don't have to develop anything. Products are available both for free and commercially.
[22:21:25] <johndoe2> as far as existing vulnerabilities go... that's another story :)
