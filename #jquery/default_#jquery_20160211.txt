[01:10:36] <_SLM_> I have a name attribute called telephoneNumbers[], which indicates an array
[01:10:44] <_SLM_> However I get an error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .form[method=put] input[name=telephoneNumber[]]
[01:11:02] <_SLM_> Does Jquery not search input[name=telephoneNumber[]] ?
[01:11:34] <_SLM_> Or is there some trick I need?
[01:12:41] <arc_> doesn't it need to be input['name="telephoneNumbers[]"']
[01:13:25] <_SLM_> Oh, good suggestion. Yeah, I usually just do without the quotes, but I suppose that will make it easier to process
[01:13:34] <_SLM_> I'll try that now
[01:15:51] <_SLM_> Seems to have worked. Thank you! :)
[01:16:01] <arc_> you're welcome

[06:52:10] <jonah> Hi can anyone spare a minute to take a look at something? On this site www.yorkshire.hosting when the page first loads and you click a box they popup great, but when you click to filter them on a category such as SEO or IT Support the popup then fails to work. I can't figure it out but should I be using something different in the a href=#small-dialog ?? Thanks for any help at all...
[06:53:29] <hellyeah> let sa you create three elements i try to get spesific dates from datepickers. But just last one is working. I want to get dates regarldess of which one i choose any advice http://jsfiddle.net/d07am8p8/1/
[07:13:02] <C0r3> I've been struggling to write tests. And it seems like impossible!! Can anybody help me with getting started with mocha and UnitJS?
[07:27:51] <hellyeah> why .att('id') not working damn
[07:27:57] <hellyeah> .attr
[07:36:10] <CalimeroTeknik> hello, I put this in a page and the select is empty: <select id="foo"></select><script type="text/javascript">$('#foo').append('<option>bar</option>')</script>
[07:36:40] <CalimeroTeknik> I know it's supposed to work (it works in jsfiddle for instance), but I get no error and in my page it does not
[07:38:50] <pacMakaveli> CalimeroTeknik: what's the error?
[07:39:42] <kristhian> anyone can help me provide jquery with this script -> http://pastebin.com/5gckA8V6
[07:39:43] <CalimeroTeknik> there is absolutely nothing in the console
[07:39:55] <CalimeroTeknik> that's why I'm asking, jquery doesn't seem to be talkative
[07:40:00] <kristhian> my goal is to refresh the picture when the user logs out
[07:44:20] <CalimeroTeknik> is there any way to know what goes wrong when jquery returns no error and it works in a separate example?
[07:44:32] <pacMakaveli> CalimeroTeknik: put some console.log before and after your event. If it's not logging then your method doesn't fire
[07:44:45] <pacMakaveli> *exectue
[07:44:57] <CalimeroTeknik> everything logs
[07:45:05] <CalimeroTeknik> I did that already, I get the two messages
[07:45:23] <b1101> if I do something like this $("#chartsDropdownMenu").serialize(); chartsDropdownMenu reprsenting the id of a div in which there are nested divs with checkboxes. It should grab all the checkbox names and values right?
[07:45:38] <pacMakaveli> Then you might have some conflicts with your scripts. I don't know your code so can't really help
[07:46:09] <CalimeroTeknik> thanks, I'll try to remove them one by one

[08:18:23] <all3fox> Hi, I'd like to discuss jQuery README on running tests. In short: 1) if a person does not know QUnit, there is very little chance they will realize that they have to set up a LAMP and serve the entirety of jquery. 2) there is no mention of `npm run test`
[08:23:22] <jancoow> all these questionss. xD
[08:24:30] <b1101> does serialize only work on form elements?
[08:40:13] <decx> yes
[08:43:48] <Mark_____> i have a question regarding infinite scrolling. is there anyway i can get rid of the ‘jscroll added’ div that appears when using this partiular plugin jscroll?
[08:45:04] <Uhkis_> all3fox: those are probably issues for github
[08:51:06] <slax0r> Mark_____: probably not
[08:51:10] <slax0r> unless you change the lib
[08:51:14] <Mark_____> yeah.
[08:51:17] <slax0r> why not just give it a css rule to hide it?
[08:51:19] <slax0r> or something
[08:51:22] <slax0r> if it's not needed
[08:51:35] <Mark_____> i can’t hide it cause there’s contents inside it
[08:51:36] <Mark_____> but,
[08:51:54] <Mark_____> um,the problem im having is that
[08:51:59] <Mark_____> if you got to this page : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/request
[08:52:09] <Mark_____> you can see how the divs are aligned properly by the masonry.js
[08:52:20] <Mark_____> but as you scroll through,the 2nd content comes up
[08:52:34] <Mark_____> but notice how there’s a separate line
[08:52:42] <Mark_____> because the contents are added by the jscroll
[08:52:51] <Mark_____> i just want to get rid of that line. that’s all ^^
[09:03:19] <hellyeah> hey
[09:03:26] <hellyeah> can anyone help me xD
[09:06:40] <Mark_____> what
[09:06:43] <Mark_____> hellyeah:
[09:06:52] <Mark_____> ran out of water in your brain?
[09:07:17] <hellyeah> you can create many datepickers and select the dates but each time i want to get spesific level of dates how can i do that any ideas  http://jsfiddle.net/d07am8p8/15/
[09:07:28] <hellyeah> Mark_____: my way is listening music all day
[09:07:37] <hellyeah> that keeps my brain active
[09:07:59] <hellyeah> everyday my distance from home to work + work to home is about 140km
[09:08:08] <Mark_____> okay..
[09:08:16] <hellyeah> with this physical exhaustion it is not really possible to work
[09:08:30] <hellyeah> music conpensate me really well tbh
[09:42:22] <Mark_____> i have a question : is there anyway i can execute jquery function after data is loaded? i know it is possible using ajax call, but is it possible without using ajax call?
[09:48:05] <pmercado> what do you mean with "after data is loaded" if not ajax?
[09:51:40] <CalimeroTeknik> I have found the issue. using Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml, I can't insert child elements with jquery!
[10:02:33] <hellyeah> hey
[10:03:24] <hellyeah> does it make sense to use event inside map to get only value of slicked element? Map will iterate all element that exist in the dom?
[10:04:11] <shoky> map iterates whatever you tell it to iterate ;p
[10:04:43] <decx> wat
[10:05:03] <ace_me> I am trying to remove some validation rules but I get an error in $('#' + item).rules('remove'); TypeError: j is undefined
[10:05:58] <xec> easy. just define j
[10:06:59] <decx> why do you remove rules
[10:07:13] <hellyeah> i try to write a fiddle
[10:07:21] <decx> just write your rules to apply to your requirement
[10:10:35] <hellyeah> hey
[10:11:39] <hellyeah> let say you create two datepickers and select the dates from first eleme i want to get those dates, or if you select dates from second element i want to get the dates. I mean i just want to get dates from spesific element. Can you help to figure out how i can do it   var date = [];
[10:11:42] <hellyeah> ops
[10:11:56] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/d07am8p8/17/
[10:13:24] <hellyeah> hope you guys understand my question
[10:14:49] <taplar> repeat it?
[10:14:52] <shoky> hellyeah you get the dates like you always get them.. with  .datepicker('getDate')
[10:15:15] <hellyeah> shoky: thats not the problem i think
[10:15:24] <hellyeah> what i try to do is when you create multiple elements
[10:15:34] <hellyeah> i try to get dates from each of them seperately
[10:15:47] <shoky> .datepicker('getDate')  on each one you want to get :)
[10:16:11] <decx> stop repeating traversals and start caching that shit
[10:16:28] <hellyeah> shoky: instead of this      var start =
[10:16:29] <hellyeah> $(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.from').val(
[10:16:44] <shoky> what?
[10:16:48] <hellyeah> decx: i have to return dates
[10:16:54] <hellyeah> dates array
[10:17:04] <hellyeah> map can return
[10:17:13] <decx> doesnt change a thing
[10:17:22] <hellyeah> remove map?
[10:17:49] <decx> you can just cache your traversal once
[10:18:04] <decx> var tofield = $(this).parent().find('.to');
[10:18:11] <decx> now you can tofield.val() or whatever
[10:18:46] <hellyeah> i have several $('.to')
[10:18:54] <hellyeah> you can create multiple elements
[10:19:16] <decx> you still dont get the concept do you
[10:19:49] <hellyeah> decx: map iterates all things right
[10:19:51] <hellyeah> ?
[10:19:56] <decx> i'm out
[10:20:01] <hellyeah> okey
[10:20:45] <hellyeah> man what about create ten elements
[10:20:57] <hellyeah> you will get every dates
[10:21:13] <hellyeah> i just want to get it only dates i selected from input box
[10:21:18] <hellyeah> is my english suck?
[10:22:08] <shoky> it's less about your english.. more that you don't say what the problem is. you said you need to get the dates,  we told you how ( .datepicker('getDate') )  though you already knew that
[10:22:14] <shoky> so we don't know what the problem is
[10:22:33] <shoky> and if the problem is that you want us to do it for you, then no :)
[10:23:15] <shoky> we've seen how that works out :)
[10:26:17] <hellyeah> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/d07am8p8/18/ can you create two datepickers and select dates from first datepickers you will see starting date and ending date is null. When you select dates from second datepicker you will see all dates in an array. Two arrays are created  pls check the console
[10:27:08] <shoky> yes.. the same thing you've been pasting here for weeks
[10:27:11] <taplar> lol
[10:27:17] <taplar> seriously dude
[10:27:23] <taplar> you still haven't fixed your global lookups
[10:27:29] <ace_me> decx it should work with: $('.panel-body').find('input[name=' + item +']').rules('remove');
[10:27:32] <taplar> if you don't fix what we tell you is an issue, why should we try?
[10:27:33] <ace_me> $('.panel-body').find('input[name=' + item +']') is an object
[10:27:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:27:36] <ace_me> so selector works
[10:27:46] <shoky> hellyeah: again, you did not specify any problem
[10:28:21] <ace_me> TypeError: j is undefined ...{var d,e,f,g,h,i,j=this[0];if(b)switch(d=a.data(j.form,"validator").settings,e=d...

[10:28:55] <Mark_____> how should i make a spinner that appears during the loading of a page inside iframe, and disappears after done loading the contents in the iframe? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[10:29:29] <taplar> Mark_____: i would assume the page would show the spinner and then hide it on load
[10:29:37] <Mark_____> yes.
[10:29:41] <taplar> right
[10:29:44] <Mark_____> i think i’ve done it with ajax but
[10:29:48] <Mark_____> this time it’s iframe..
[10:29:56] <taplar> 'the page' being the one in the iframe
[10:29:57] <hellyeah> tbh dont understand global lookup
[10:30:06] <taplar> $(selector) is a global lookup
[10:30:06] <hellyeah> global lookup in map
[10:30:08] <taplar> there is no context
[10:30:28] <taplar> it finds all elements that match
[10:30:30] <hellyeah> which line are you talking about?
[10:30:36] <taplar> there are multiple.  read your code
[10:31:20] <hellyeah> this is global lookup $('.input').on('change', function() {
[10:31:49] <taplar> so keep looking
[10:32:00] <taplar> any where that you see a global look up, make sure that is what you should be doing
[10:32:18] <hellyeah> var start =
[10:32:19] <hellyeah> $(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.from').datepicker('getDate') this is global lookup
[10:32:36] <taplar> $(element) is not a global lookup
[10:32:42] <taplar> element =/= selector
[10:33:02] <hellyeah> ah right
[10:33:09] <hellyeah> var outputArray = $(' .datePart .datePicker').map(function(index) { this is global lookup
[10:33:17] <taplar> yep
[10:33:40] <hellyeah> okey this is global lookup yeah
[10:33:52] <hellyeah> do i need to change that?
[10:34:07] <hellyeah> obviously map will ierate all things
[10:34:11] <taplar> hellyeah: ...
[10:34:15] <taplar> SHOULD it do that?
[10:34:19] <hellyeah> no
[10:34:20] <taplar> you can answer that yourself
[10:34:23] <hellyeah> ofc no
[10:34:28] <Mark_____> does anyone use safari here?
[10:34:35] <hellyeah> can i wrap it with change
[10:34:44] <hellyeah> change event
[10:34:48] <taplar> lots of things are possible with javascript
[10:34:53] <taplar> your asking if you should
[10:34:57] <taplar> you can answer these questions
[10:35:02] <taplar> i'm not sure why your asking
[10:35:18] <hellyeah> hmm i am tired i must be off for sometimes
[10:35:25] <hellyeah> but event cannot return anything
[10:35:35] <hellyeah> damn anyway
[10:35:49] <taplar> you have a problem.  you know what the end result should be.  figure out the steps that need to happen to get there
[10:35:52] <taplar> then make it happen
[10:37:52] <Mark_____> well,
[10:37:59] <Mark_____> how should i make a spinner that appears during the loading of a page inside iframe, and disappears after done loading the contents in the iframe? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[10:38:03] <Mark_____> can anybody help me?
[10:38:13] <taplar> already told you one possible solution Mark
[10:38:34] <Mark_____> yeah,but the thing is i can’t start from scratch
[10:38:39] <taplar> ?
[10:39:09] <cipher__> What is the HTTP attribute name for data in $.post(arg1, data, arg3)?
[10:39:40] <shoky> cipher__: huh?
[10:40:21] <cipher__> shoky, what is the actual attribute name being used? the key name of the key-value pair.
[10:40:39] <shoky> cipher__: data isn't sent in an http header, it's sent as the http request _body_
[10:40:46] <cipher__> oh.
[10:41:08] <cipher__> shoky, how do I go about setting a header?
[10:41:25] <shoky> cipher__: with $.ajax and 'headers' option, for example
[10:41:40] <cipher__> I can't do it with simply $.post?
[10:41:49] <shoky> nope
[10:42:15] <shoky> $.post  is just  $.ajax({type:'post'})
[10:42:38] <lowbro> which is a very nice thing!
[10:42:54] <shoky> need to remember the arguments order with $.post
[10:42:56] <shoky> not nice.
[10:43:28] <Nanor> Can anyone tell me why the login modal works here: https://freelancestudent.herokuapp.com/#modal but not here: https://freelancestudent.herokuapp.com/broken-modal#modal
[10:47:55] <taplar> got some console errors dude
[10:48:23] <Nanor> oooooh there's a lot of those
[10:48:33] <taplar> .....fix em?
[10:48:42] <Nanor> that's the plan!
[10:50:01] <Nanor> well, i fixed it. I moved the script files from the bottom of the page, to the top of the page
[10:51:03] <Nanor> Does that make sense?
[10:51:26] <taplar> so long as they're in the correct order shouldn't really matter where they're placed
[10:51:38] <taplar> head vs body just determines if you need to use a doc ready or not
[10:52:07] <taplar> *provided your scripts do dom lookups

[11:08:48] <fas3r> Hello
[11:35:53] <WG1337> Hi! Is there a simple workaround to allow cross-origin requests? Im building a intranet page and I need to make a ajax request from a different web server. Can this be done on the server side or the client side? I can configure or change both
[11:37:30] <taplar> i've done something like that by changing the .htaccess file on an apache server.  i'm sure it can be done on other servers
[11:38:33] <Uhkis_> WG1337: you need to set it up on the server, having it on client would defeat the whole point of the protection
[11:40:34] <taplar> http://enable-cors.org/server_apache.html if your doing apache.  I did this on one of mine as i didn't care, but if you care about which server you allow you'll probably want to use that in some fashion rather than a global *
[11:44:46] <WG1337> do I need to enable cors on the server on which I make the request FROM or on which server TO ?
[11:44:52] <taplar> to
[11:45:28] <taplar> you don't make the request from a server
[11:45:35] <taplar> you make it from a client, :)
[11:50:46] <WG1337> damn it, nginx isnt compiled with header module. Are there any other options?
[11:50:58] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel?
[11:51:49] <WG1337> maybe, unless there is a JS workaround
[11:51:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:52:12] <WG1337> remove cors either from server side or client side
[11:52:17] <taplar> like Uhkis_ said earlier, if js could overcome CORS it wouldn't really be a security measure
[11:52:18] <robertmaxrees> can't from the client side.
[11:52:22] <robertmaxrees> it's a server-side isue.
[11:52:35] <robertmaxrees> JS being able to "work around" CORS would mean I could read your email.
[11:53:16] <WG1337> since im using this only on a restricted and isolated network, that really isnt an issue
[11:53:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't think you understand - it's provided by the browsers and servers on purpose.  you can't work around it.
[11:54:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:54:23] <WG1337> if someone has added, someone can remove it. But ok, I understand
[11:54:39] <ABM_Dan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome
[11:54:47] <taplar> http://enable-cors.org/server_nginx.html
[11:54:48] <robertmaxrees> that's terrible advice, ABM_Dan
[11:54:56] <robertmaxrees> you're now exposing all those client machines to CORS.
[11:55:10] <robertmaxrees> err, non-cors setups.
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> which means they could visit an arbitrary page that exploits that vulnerability.
[11:55:24] <ABM_Dan> I'm not taking responsibility.
[11:55:29] <robertmaxrees> then don't link it ;)
[11:55:55] <ABM_Dan> It answers his question.
[11:55:55] <WG1337> has anyone heard a thing about intranet?
[11:56:03] <taplar> live and breath it
[11:56:09] <robertmaxrees> WG1337 sure - it's still a browser.
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> fix the server.
[11:56:33] <WG1337> so why are you concerned about security risks?
[11:56:40] <robertmaxrees> because everybody should be.
[11:56:40] <taplar> you should always be concerned
[11:56:54] <taplar> your relying on that no one will be able to intrude into your network
[11:57:17] <taplar> works, trojans, they exist
[11:57:19] <taplar> *worms
[11:57:23] <WG1337> because its not connected to anything
[11:57:54] <ABM_Dan> WG1337: It's a bad idea, you should definetly *not* do it, there are issues you are likely not in the position of understanding right away, or you wouldn't be trying to do that.
[11:58:30] <ABM_Dan> That said, I gave you the way to do it, should you feel like you have enough experience to ignore a full chatroom of people telling you "don't".
[11:58:52] <taplar> hey, i gave a link to the ngnix setup thing, :)
[11:59:22] <taplar> i'm just saying the "i'm on intranet so i don't care about security" is a bad approach
[11:59:44] <ABM_Dan> We all, with the exception of WG1337, agree, I think.
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> deliberately circumventing browser security is a bad idea.  always.
[11:59:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:00:07] <Uhkis> "attention intranet users, each time you use the intranet, start your chrome with this flag" is also pretty bad :D
[12:00:09] <robertmaxrees> also: it'll make your IT staff hate you less to apply a patch to those client machines :)
[12:03:29] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: why do you hate tradition? :P
[12:04:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:13:31] <robertmaxrees> awwwwyisss
[12:18:09] <taplar> lol
[12:21:47] <CalimeroTeknik> how can I add a child element to an element in jQuery? it must work in xhtml.
[12:22:38] <jonah> Hi could anybody please help. I have lightbox popups with Magnific popup on the boxes on this page: http://www.yorkshire.hosting - they work great until you click to filter the categories (which I use MixItUp for) - then the popups no longer work. Could anybody please take a look as I can't figure out a fix... Thanks for any help.
[12:22:41] <CalimeroTeknik> .append() stops working as soon as I use Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml'
[12:23:16] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: its 2016. wtf is xhtml?
[12:23:38] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: how are you using that content-type anyways / where/
[12:23:54] <CalimeroTeknik> in the server's reply headers
[12:24:09] <CalimeroTeknik> that enforces that the document be a correct tree
[12:24:23] <CalimeroTeknik> if you forget to close a div, big error in the browser
[12:24:25] <NoiseEee> pastebin your code CalimeroTeknik
[12:24:54] <NoiseEee> also a servers reply headers don't force anything
[12:25:02] <CalimeroTeknik> <select id="foo"></select><script type="text/javascript">$('#foo').append('<option>bar</option>')</script>
[12:25:04] <NoiseEee> but it may change how you acccess the data you need in the response
[12:25:14] <CalimeroTeknik> it changes the browser's behaviour.
[12:25:30] <CalimeroTeknik> maybe you need a full-fledged example
[12:25:38] <NoiseEee> yes set up a fiddle if you can
[12:25:54] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't think I can change the content-type of a fiddle, I'll create an example page
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> CalimeroTeknik you just want to append a child to an element?
[12:28:49] <CalimeroTeknik> yes
[12:29:10] <robertmaxrees> .append()
[12:29:13] <CalimeroTeknik> there you go! simple example http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-xhtml.php
[12:29:20] <CalimeroTeknik> oops
[12:29:23] <CalimeroTeknik> forgot to load jquery
[12:29:34] <shoky> CalimeroTeknik maybe you need <![CDATA[  ...   ]]>    around your inline script
[12:30:37] <CalimeroTeknik> okay, you can try it http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-xhtml.php
[12:30:56] <shoky> CalimeroTeknik: put an alert in that script
[12:31:11] <CalimeroTeknik> okay shoky, it'll work you'll see
[12:31:27] <BetaFrey> Is it a possibility that my navbar is not displaying correctly in IE11 vs Chrome/FF due to jquery or would that only be possible with bootstrap? :S
[12:31:47] <CalimeroTeknik> shoky, see http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-xhtml.php
[12:32:25] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey or bad markup/css/js
[12:32:38] <CalimeroTeknik> jquery just silently fails to add the child when we're in xhtml (the only thing that changes is a header in the HTTP response, compare with http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-html.php )
[12:32:49] <shoky> CalimeroTeknik: that line is just not running
[12:33:17] <CalimeroTeknik> the query line? it doesn't work, in any case.
[12:33:17] <BetaFrey> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:33:56] <CalimeroTeknik> shoky, compare how the page is identical and only the html version works: http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-html.php VS http://oremilac.tk/paste/jquery-append-xhtml.php
[12:34:16] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: try appending an actual element
[12:34:17] <shoky> CalimeroTeknik:  try putting this as first line of your inline script..  /* <![CDATA[ */      and this as last line:  /* ]]> */
[12:34:23] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: or using .html()
[12:34:25] <CalimeroTeknik> oh I'm very sorry, testing this
[12:34:26] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:34:34] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: you're appending a string of html, vs an actual element
[12:34:42] <robertmaxrees> CalimeroTeknik you have some linebreaks screwing with you.
[12:34:47] <NoiseEee> so either try .html() for that or make an element and then append that.
[12:34:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to escape the script tag.
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> also: can you use the html doctype with an xml page?
[12:35:59] <shoky> CDATA fixed it
[12:35:59] <CalimeroTeknik> it works! thanks shoky (updated online)
[12:36:01] <NoiseEee> really, what i said works as well
[12:36:23] <NoiseEee> you're making more work though. .append is for elements, .html is for html strings.
[12:36:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you inlining JS like that?
[12:36:36] <NoiseEee> you can keep it as is and just use .html() without CDATA and it would work as well
[12:36:36] <CalimeroTeknik> I see, I'd rather create an element
[12:37:05] <NoiseEee> CalimeroTeknik: var option = $('<option>')
[12:37:13] <shoky> .append is for html too, no..?
[12:37:23] <NoiseEee> shoky: not for html strings iirc
[12:37:35] <shoky> it is
[12:37:41] <NoiseEee> interesting
[12:38:06] <NoiseEee> well it won't work in an xml based doc i guess
[12:38:27] <shoky> well it's working
[12:38:28] <shoky> ;)
[12:38:34] <robertmaxrees> why not try putting the JS in a separate file and linking that?
[12:38:47] <CalimeroTeknik> is this better? $('#foo').append($('<option>').text('bar'));
[12:38:57] <robertmaxrees> afaik the entire problem is how the js is getting parsed in that mode.
[12:39:04] <shoky> right ^
[12:39:16] <sigdk> hello. I'm using datatables plugin and I have a couple of questions. First, what's the difference between datatable and Datatable (here is supposed to explain this but I don't understand: https://datatables.net/faqs/#api)
[12:39:22] <shoky> CalimeroTeknik as robert says, best is to use an external script
[12:39:36] <taplar> sigdk: Datatables is the newer constructor
[12:39:39] <shoky> please the xhtml gods
[12:39:39] <CalimeroTeknik> true, will do
[12:39:44] <CalimeroTeknik> thanks very much for the help
[12:39:51] <taplar> sigdk: it has some different methods, constructors, etc
[12:40:09] <taplar> sigdk: datatables is the older of the two, but is still included in newer versions
[12:40:23] <robertmaxrees> sigdk do you understand what a jquery object is vs a datatables object?
[12:40:43] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, nope... I would expect they 're the same
[12:40:55] <robertmaxrees> not at all :) that's what the docs are telling oyu.
[12:40:56] <robertmaxrees> *you
[12:41:59] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, so, what's the difference ?
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> one inherits all the jquery methods and properties.
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> the other inherits the datatables methods and properties.
[12:45:01] <BetaFrey> When I am running my site that menu is only screwed up when I debug but if i F12 and switch compatability mode then it fixes the navbar, is there a way to figure out what version of IE it is currently "using" or how come its loading wrong but when i emulate it fixes -- i currently have compatabilty mode turned off
[12:45:37] <BetaFrey> Holy crap that sentence didn't make much sense sorry,
[12:46:21] <robertmaxrees> check the device dropdown and see what the "Default" option is.
[12:46:33] <robertmaxrees> it'll be next to the version number it's defaulting to.
[12:46:46] <BetaFrey> I need to switch that in the meta tag of my program then if its not loading to the version i wish?
[12:47:01] <robertmaxrees> what version are you getting?
[12:47:06] <robertmaxrees> and that can be caused by all kinds of issues.
[12:47:09] <BetaFrey> Well i have IE11 but its loading as 8
[12:47:30] <robertmaxrees> is the webserver on the same network and your machine?
[12:47:38] <robertmaxrees> because it might think it's an intranet site.
[12:47:40] <BetaFrey> i'm running IIS
[12:47:45] <BetaFrey> i ahve that all turned off
[12:47:46] <robertmaxrees> it could also be because of invalid markup.
[12:48:40] <BetaFrey> It would just be nice if it could load in the browser version 11 instead of defaulting to 8 :S
[12:48:51] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to fix whatever is causing that.
[12:48:58] <robertmaxrees> setting headers won't necessarily fix that.
[12:49:03] <BetaFrey> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8" />
[12:49:07] <BetaFrey> That maybe
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> so that's in your header?
[12:49:14] <robertmaxrees> kill it.
[12:49:17] <BetaFrey> i found it XD
[12:49:43] <BetaFrey> Thanks sorry i'm running on fumes.
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> it's okay.
[12:50:04] <robertmaxrees> glad you found it.
[12:50:40] <BetaFrey> Thank you.
[12:50:45] <robertmaxrees> yep ")
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[12:52:27] <Felishia> help
[12:52:38] <taplar> me ronda
[12:52:40] <Felishia> how do I do to send an ajax request with a single file
[12:52:49] <taplar> an upload?
[12:52:51] <Felishia> como que ronda aqui no hay rondas >:c
[12:52:58] <Felishia> taplar, yup
[12:53:05] <Felishia> I need to send a raw bytes body
[12:53:14] <taplar> ok, so you need a few things
[12:53:20] <Felishia> an instance of Blob or File
[12:53:29] <taplar> you need the file input that the user can use to select the file to upload
[12:53:39] <taplar> then your ajax can grab that file from it and put it in a FormData element
[12:53:43] <Felishia> I have th File already in a variable
[12:53:45] <Felishia> why in a form data?
[12:53:49] <Felishia> can't I send it raw?
[12:53:57] <taplar> which you can send to the ajax and make sure you set processData to false, and something else too
[12:54:05] <Felishia> it is false
[12:54:13] <taplar> maybe you can serialize that form and use that, not sure
[12:54:16] <Felishia> formdata expect keys and values
[12:54:18] <taplar> i've only done it with FormData
[12:54:25] <Felishia> I need to send pure binary data
[12:54:28] <Felishia> in the body
[12:54:35] <taplar> oh, not sure you can do that
[12:55:47] <robertmaxrees> search arund on google.  you might find something.
[12:56:30] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/scripts/src/workspaceService.js  search for 'uploadFile' is how I did it once
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11399484/posting-file-input-as-filereader-binary-data-through-ajax-post Felishia
[13:09:53] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, checking
[13:10:39] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, that's what I'm just doing
[13:10:44] <Felishia> it's not really working
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> "it's not really working" doesn't tell me anything ;)
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you know that you might need to change your server-side, right?
[13:12:36] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, my server side is supposed to be expecting that
[13:13:03] <Felishia> I think
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe back up and explain what the issue is?  some context might be helpful.
[13:13:05] <Felishia> hmm
[13:13:43] <Felishia> the problem is that I'm actually getting a json
[13:13:56] <Felishia> so I'm a bit confused maybe it actually expects a key value
[13:14:23] <Felishia> let me try the implementation is based on express bodyParser maybe it expects that what taplar says
[13:18:28] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees:
[13:19:48] <GrundeLL> Hello, this is a very simplified version of the code that I'm running, though i cant seam to get rid of the commas in the list... how to i achive this? https://jsfiddle.net/geeohbc1/5/
[13:20:35] <GrundeLL> I.e. there is a <li>content</li> "," <li>content</li>, and i want to remove the comma
[13:21:30] <shoky> GrundeLL:  outo.join('')  will join them with no commas
[13:22:30] <Felishia> how do I make sure that it is sending a file?
[13:22:46] <GrundeLL> shoky: doesnt work ...
[13:23:37] <shoky> GrundeLL: i don't know what you're doing
[13:23:46] <GrundeLL> 2 sec
[13:23:59] <robertmaxrees> also might want to use a forEach instead of a for loop;.
[13:24:54] <robertmaxrees> since for loops don't have scope so those var declarations are actually polluting that scope.
[13:25:43] <GrundeLL> shoky: so i tried replacing the "push" variable with join, then i created a var newOuto = outo.join();
[13:25:52] <GrundeLL> shoky: neither worked...
[13:26:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/geeohbc1/7/
[13:26:38] <robertmaxrees> outo.join('')
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> that's all you needed.
[13:27:39] <GrundeLL> shoky: Ah sorry, my bad wrote a typeo ... :/
[13:27:50] <GrundeLL> Now it works thanks shoky!
[13:30:10] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees: do you happen to have a list of reousrces you find helpful for people who are newer to anything javascriptishy?
[13:30:35] <shoky> GrundeLL: np. and yea for loops are gross, .forEach and .map are much nicer and you get cleaner code e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/geeohbc1/6/    no useless i,j,var all over the place
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey mdn is nice.  learn.jquery.com is a good resource, as is fixingthesejquery.com
[13:31:35] <BetaFrey> i've done my best to try to avoid anything javascripty so far but i can't avoid it anylonger :S Thank you robertmaxrees
[13:31:35] <GrundeLL> shoky: ah thats nice.
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey JS is a nice language with a bad heritage.
[13:32:01] <GrundeLL> shoky: been looking in to using handlebars actually
[13:32:03] <robertmaxrees> modern JS isn't nearly as bad as people make it seem.
[13:32:30] <GrundeLL> shoky: but cant get it to set up properly with wordpress Sage Startertheme...
[13:32:43] <shoky> GrundeLL: yeah some sort of templating is definitely a good idea
[13:33:00] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees: i just am unfamiliar with much of it's syntax / expansion since I focused more exclusively on .net and only used bits and pieces here and there but now i feel like i probably need to actually understand what i'm doing.
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey yeah.  once you get into a little you'll pick up on its strengths.  don't treat it like a classical oo language though - it's very bad at that.
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> treat it a little more... object functional almost.  your life will be easier.
[13:34:09] <shoky> BetaFrey: there's also http://eloquentjavascript.net/  pretty good
[13:34:10] <Felishia> this is awful
[13:34:12] <Felishia> nothing works
[13:34:19] <Felishia> where's my body anyway?
[13:34:26] <Felishia> I tried formdata and it is also stuck
[13:34:50] <Felishia> I cannot even see the request in dev tools happening regardless it's 100% certain it contains such body in the request
[13:35:27] <robertmaxrees> Felishia you're not seeing it in your network tab?
[13:35:30] <shoky> Felishia we have no idea what you're doing
[13:35:33] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure you're not filtering it out?
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> becuase otherwise, you're being kind of ephemeral.
[13:35:51] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, nope
[13:35:54] <BetaFrey> thank you robertmaxrees
[13:36:03] <Felishia> and I'm confused because I'm pretty certain it should be being sent
[13:36:04] <robertmaxrees> Felishia dunno how to help you then.
[13:36:10] <robertmaxrees> Felishia share some code or something.
[13:36:15] <Felishia> right
[13:37:17] <Felishia> https://gist.github.com/onzag/b6d9aa72721c1ca01fa1
[13:37:37] <Felishia> ask me about the value of each you want and I'll tell you
[13:37:43] <Felishia> I have the debug tool on
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure this is even getting called?
[13:38:35] <BetaFrey> Yesterday or the day before i learned how to check if my javascripties were acutally being called it took me forever i was fuming lool
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep not just calling it "javascript" or "js"?
[13:38:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:38:58] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, yes now it sends the data...
[13:39:12] <Felishia> stupid cache
[13:39:19] <Felishia> but only does when I use FormData
[13:39:26] <Felishia> can't send a Blob or File
[13:54:02] <_TWG_> Has anyone worked with Leaflet?
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure plenty of people have,
[13:56:10] <_TWG_> I followed their docs, http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#marker-addto to add a marker but in the console it's telling me cannot read property of undefined
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> what's the line throwing the error?
[13:57:18] <_TWG_> L.Marker([lat, lon]).addTo(map).bindPopup();
[13:57:18] <robertmaxrees> just the .addTo() itself?
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> or .Marker() ?
[13:57:32] <_TWG_> .addTo
[13:57:43] <_TWG_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addTo' of undefined
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> then L.Marker([lat, lon]) isn't doing what you think it is.
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> you sure you loaded the plugin and initialized it correctly?
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> *library, not plugin.
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> looks like it should be a lowercase m.
[13:58:36] <robertmaxrees> l.marker()
[13:58:44] <_TWG_> Yes.  I wrote the add to marker in a function for looping.  If I move the code back to the way I had it before, it loaded just fine.
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, lowercase the m.  that should fix it.
[14:00:48] <_TWG_> Wow, that was it.  I forget how case sensitive jquery is.
[14:00:55] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery issue.
[14:01:36] <robertmaxrees> looks like that lib doesn't even make use of jquery
[14:01:36] <_TWG_> Ahh.  Okay.  Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate it.
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[14:01:52] <_TWG_> deffo?
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> short for "definitely"
[14:02:07] <_TWG_> Ahh, gotcha.  My bad
[14:02:16] <robertmaxrees> s'all good ;)
[14:05:09] <mchu> is there a jquery to only append something once?
[14:05:18] <mchu> or i must use a conditional to only append something one time
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> need to use a conditional afaik.
[14:05:54] <mchu> nevermind! .text works well
[14:06:09] <robertmaxrees> that's different fwiw.
[14:06:13] <robertmaxrees> that sets text of an element.
[14:06:17] <mchu> oh i see
[14:06:24] <robertmaxrees> you could use .html() if you need to replace the html of an element.,
[14:07:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd do the check first so you're not unnecessarily modifying the DOM.
[14:12:25] <Felishia> robertmaxrees, in fact it was that the browser does not show me the request with binary data
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:12:55] <Felishia> and the fact that the catcher in my server side sucks and I had to write my own one so it didn't see it either
[14:13:14] <robertmaxrees> still lost, but it sounds like you figured it out?
[14:13:16] <Felishia> for some reason nor the browser nor the server could see the request body
[14:13:18] <Felishia> yeah
[14:13:25] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[14:13:43] <Felishia> I had to write my own implementation in the server (to read raw content) like the easiest thing to do, not supported by the parser
[14:13:51] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:14:12] <Felishia> but why in the world couldn't google chrome see my request body?
[14:15:21] <robertmaxrees> why couldn't chrome look at binary post data?
[14:15:52] <shoky> have you ever seen it show binary data for other requests?
[14:23:36] <hellyeah> let me ask this
[14:24:14] <hellyeah> while creating multiple input boxes is it wise to restrict user to fill both inputboxes
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:24:31] <hellyeah> and each time user create new one get the value of last input boxes
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> you completely skipped the part where you explained what you're building :)
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> just having multiple inputs has absolutely no bearing on anything you've said so far.
[14:26:04] <SmashingX> hey guys I have a bunch of buttons on an html page, how can I catch when I click any of them?
[14:26:13] <taplar> SmashingX: use a delegate
[14:26:16] <SmashingX> I was told that I needed to add a class to them
[14:26:28] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX nah.  use a delegated listener.
[14:26:31] <BetaFrey> you probably would want them to be filled before you create even more hellyeah?
[14:26:35] <hellyeah> you can bind event
[14:26:37] <SmashingX> currently I'm using $('#idofthebutton').on('click', function (e) {
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not a delegated listener.
[14:26:47] <hellyeah> like 'click', function() ...
[14:26:48] <hellyeah> or
[14:26:48] <taplar> SmashingX: taplar.com/jquery/#delegateEventBinding
[14:26:55] <hellyeah> 'click', functionname
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's not a delegated handler.
[14:27:21] <hellyeah> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:27:25] <robertmaxrees> also http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:27:27] <SmashingX> so is not possiuble to use classes fot that then?
[14:27:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:27:34] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX you could also use classes.
[14:27:37] <taplar> you can, but a delegate is more efficient
[14:28:04] <taplar> one binding vs multiple, and it's semi future proof, so long as you don't replace the parent
[14:30:42] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees: each time get the content of last one http://jsfiddle.net/d07am8p8/19/ and disable create button until selecting both dates from input boxes. Is that doable?
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> i gotta dash though.  pretty easy to implement.
[14:31:14] <robertmaxrees> good lucxk.
[14:31:17] <robertmaxrees> *luck
[14:31:51] <hellyeah> dash
[14:31:59] <hellyeah> dunno what it means
[14:32:03] <hellyeah> hmm let me check
[14:32:12] <hellyeah> taplar: do you think this is doable
[14:32:15] <hellyeah> ?
[14:32:24] <shoky> you don't believe robert?
[14:32:45] <hellyeah> i believe robet
[14:32:52] <hellyeah> robert :)
[14:32:55] <shoky> then why waste poor taplar's time
[14:33:11] <hellyeah> hmm i am sorryu
[14:33:20] <taplar> what is your concern with doing it that way?
[14:33:28] <SmashingX> taplar:
[14:33:48] <SmashingX> how are you using that in here? https://jsfiddle.net/ybssLn1t/
[14:34:11] <SmashingX> I just copied your code there but I don't see anything, what version of jqeury are you using for that?
[14:34:17] <taplar> you needa stick something in the i so it's clickable
[14:34:47] <taplar> the 'icon-x' class is ment to signify that some how it's a delete marker
[14:34:51] <taplar> however you want to style it
[14:35:08] <hellyeah> shoky: it always helps me thats why i asked him
[14:35:10] <Zzaichik> <i> doesn't quite work that way.
[14:35:13] <Zzaichik> Should be closed
[14:35:23] <Zzaichik> <i>Icon</i>
[14:35:28] <hellyeah> shoky: but i noted what you said
[14:35:29] <shoky> hellyeah: you already got an answer but ok
[14:35:33] <huck5> taplar, wanted to thank you again for your help yesterday. (Replacing jQuery UI widget). Based on your suggestion I got a totally working solution. You were very helpful.
[14:35:48] <taplar> oh, the resizable thing?
[14:36:16] <taplar> SmashingX: https://jsfiddle.net/ybssLn1t/1/
[14:36:27] <taplar> i'll have to update the page, :)
[14:36:44] <SmashingX> thanks
[14:36:49] <SmashingX> I'll check thagt
[14:37:34] <SmashingX> It just looks the same to me as using classes
[14:38:34] <taplar> your still using classes, it's just where your attaching
[14:38:56] <taplar> $('.class').on(event, handler) puts the handler on every one of those elements
[14:39:07] <taplar> and only those elements, not future ones
[14:39:19] <taplar> this is all explained on my page, :P  and the other sites
[14:39:47] * taplar fixed the markup
[14:40:45] <hellyeah> well handler is function right?
[14:40:50] <taplar> yes
[14:41:14] <hellyeah> $('button').on('click', function);
[14:41:56] <hellyeah> are you using delegates if you want to assign a function to many elements at one time is this the logic?
[14:42:11] <taplar> maybe you should read the page too, :P
[14:42:24] <HowardwLo> how do i submit a form with ajax but let the page refresh for responses? https://dpaste.de/2WQV
[14:42:47] <HowardwLo> im using ajax to submit because my form data isn’t in an input field, but rather an editable div
[14:42:53] <taplar> HowardwLo: refresh in the done/success of the ajax
[14:43:53] <HowardwLo> taplar: the response contains a notification that i’d like to display. if i refresh, will that be a seperate get request?
[14:44:31] <taplar> so define 'refresh'.  do you mean just show that notification?
[14:45:30] <HowardwLo> taplar: the response i get is the full page with the addition of a notification that says the form was recieved
[14:45:54] <HowardwLo> taplar: if i refresh, which i think is a browser refresh, the notification won’t show because it’ll be a regular get request and not a form post success
[14:47:23] <taplar> so other than the notification, is there anything else that changes?
[14:47:55] <taplar> typically ajax calls don't return full pages
[14:47:57] <SmashingX> taplar: I did something similar to your example but is not working :(
[14:47:58] <SmashingX> https://jsfiddle.net/128kg0jf/
[14:48:33] <taplar> SmashingX: your child filter looks wrong
[14:48:43] <SmashingX> ?
[14:48:44] <shoky> HowardwLo: might be easiest to submit a real form from your js code, setting the value of the inputs in js and calling .submit() on the form.  or change your backend code to respond only with the notification and display that in your ajax done handler
[14:48:46] <taplar> that a class?
[14:49:02] <shoky> HowardwLo: btw you want .html()  not .html  ;p
[14:49:45] <HowardwLo> shoky: :D thanks
[14:49:58] <fas3r> I'm returning with ajax "html" code from a DB as text. Then I have something like this :   I create an obj html = []. Then I populate it with my elements like this : html.push('<div>' + obj["my_html_code"] + '</div>');    Is there a way for me to get the " obj["my_html_code"] " rendered to HTML ?
[14:50:43] <shoky> what?
[14:50:59] <shoky> append it to the DOM somewhere if you want it to be rendered
[14:51:11] <taplar> SmashingX: also it doesn't look like the button is a child of the element your delegate binding on
[14:51:55] <HowardwLo> shoky: so i would prevent the button from submitting the form on click, then populate a hidden input field with the div values, then .submit() the form?
[14:52:00] <SmashingX> taplar: but the button is inside of the div
[14:52:15] <taplar> the div closes at line 4
[14:52:25] <shoky> HowardwLo: yea. tho the 2nd solution i wrote is preferable, if you control the backend
[14:52:27] <SmashingX> the button is Post my entry btw
[14:52:33] <SmashingX> ok let me check that then taplar
[14:52:34] <taplar> right
[14:53:16] <SmashingX> ok then I will change it to the div in line 9
[14:53:23] <SmashingX> I mean 8
[14:53:35] <HowardwLo> shoky: stuck with first option :|
[14:53:45] <HowardwLo> shoky: how do you prevent the form from submitting on the first button click?
[14:53:48] <shoky> HowardwLo: usually it's better to prevent the <form>'s submit event (instead of button's click event).  (and then you need to call .submit() on the raw DOM element)
[14:53:57] <HowardwLo> ah ok
[14:54:16] <SmashingX> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/128kg0jf/1/
[14:54:21] <SmashingX> still no luck
[14:54:33] <SmashingX> and this time I made sure that it was the parent of the button
[14:54:44] <taplar> your child selector is still invalid
[14:54:50] <taplar> class selectors being with '.'
[14:54:55] <taplar> ids with '#'
[14:55:19] <taplar> and now the textarea is not a child of the delegate binding, so your $(this).closest().find('textarea') will not find it
[14:55:27] <taplar> you'll have to change that
[14:55:53] <taplar> ah, hold on
[14:55:59] <taplar> your going up to form, so that may be valid
[14:56:06] <taplar> but the child filter is def wrong
[14:56:47] <SmashingX> oh sh$ I forgot the .
[15:00:40] <stan_man_can> I have a table, and in the tbody I have <tr class='parent'></tr><tr class='child'></tr>  <tr class='parent'></tr><tr class='child'></tr>  <tr class='parent'></tr><tr class='child'></tr> ect...
[15:01:03] <stan_man_can> I want to use the jquery ui sortable, but only allow you to sort the rows with a 'parent' class, but for it to also move the child along with it
[15:01:09] <stan_man_can> any way to kinda attach the child to the parent?
[15:02:05] <stan_man_can> i know the better way would probably be to re-structure the HTML,  but there's already a ton of javascript based on the current structure
[15:02:34] <shoky> and now you wanna add a ton more :|
[15:03:12] <taplar> seems like it would be easier to change the table to a set of divs that appears as a table, and make the sortable on a div around the parent child pairs
[15:03:19] <taplar> just me though
[15:04:28] <stan_man_can> taplar: totally agree
[15:04:43] <stan_man_can> but it breaks a significant amount of existing js
[15:04:55] <taplar> refactors happen, :)
[15:04:58] <stan_man_can> if it's not possible then i'll have to restructure and fix it all but
[15:05:16] <stan_man_can> was hoping to avoid a day of refactoring if possible
[15:10:25] <shoky> stan_man_can: wrapping each pair with a <tbody> could work , if that doesn't break your other code..
[15:13:46] <YamakasY> anyone a clue how to select a dropdown value from the addressbar ?
[15:14:12] <shoky> a dropdown value?
[15:15:14] <YamakasY> shoky: yes dropdown menu
[15:15:44] <shoky> the browser's address-bar dropdown ? that's not part of the page?
[15:16:04] <YamakasY> nono
[15:16:09] <YamakasY> a dropdown in my page
[15:16:16] <shoky> well you said addressbar so
[15:16:34] <YamakasY> yes like ?dropdown=foo
[15:16:38] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, taplar the second question I have about datatables is "how they work ?". There is an option of search and paging. Does this require support from a backend as well ?
[15:16:45] <shoky> how about asking a full question
[15:18:06] <sigdk> shoky, me ?
[15:18:28] <shoky> sigdk nope,  YamakasY
[15:19:13] <shoky> YamakasY you can get the url part with location.pathname  and you can set a <select>'s value with .val()
[15:19:30] <YamakasY> shoky: trying to find working examples, but I fail
[15:19:40] <shoky> just do it yourself
[15:20:27] <YamakasY> shoky: heh I'm not that good on js/jquery :)
[15:20:41] <shoky> you will not get better by copying examples
[15:21:01] <YamakasY> shoky: no, but I need to see how it works
[15:21:10] <shoky> not really
[15:21:20] <shoky> i told you what you need to do, you can try to do it
[15:21:58] <YamakasY> I am
[15:22:40] <shoky> good
[16:16:19] <YamakasY> mhh I start to hate this :)
[16:19:27] <taplar> what's up?
[16:29:37] <YamakasY> how do I set a select on selected in jquery, just like this ? $('#mySelect').val(urlParams[2]) ?
[16:29:44] <YamakasY> I can print the urlParams
[16:29:48] <robertmaxrees> "select on selected"?
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to set a dropdown?
[16:30:01] <YamakasY> yes
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you use .val()
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> make sure the value matches.
[16:30:12] <YamakasY> like this ?
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> yes, assuming that the values match.
[16:30:26] <YamakasY> yes it does
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> then you shoiuld be good to go.
[16:30:35] <YamakasY> but I need to set it upfront I guess ?
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:30:49] <YamakasY> before the dropdown is generated
[16:30:57] <robertmaxrees> you can do it after.
[16:31:01] <nsosa> hi all! has anybody worked with the jquery form plugin here http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#fields I'm trying to use serialize to send just parts of a form and I don't know how
[16:31:02] <YamakasY> ok
[16:31:11] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: it doesn't do :S
[16:31:20] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY then you have another issue.  show examples.
[16:31:34] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: the value on need to match ?
[16:31:43] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY and the select
[16:31:59] <taplar> nsosa: "var queryString = $('#myForm :text').fieldSerialize();"
[16:32:03] <taplar> ?
[16:32:06] <YamakasY> ok, there is some <optgroup label=""> around my options tho
[16:32:14] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY that's fine.
[16:32:18] <YamakasY> ok
[16:32:34] <nsosa> taplar: that works but when I submit the form it submits all the values
[16:32:38] * YamakasY does some debugging with this info :)
[16:32:42] <taplar> submit how?
[16:33:10] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: should the dropdown "change" dynamicly ? I don't think so, as you say I can set it after it
[16:33:23] <robertmaxrees> whjat do you mean?
[16:33:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll update the dropdown.
[16:33:51] <nsosa> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/hur7kq09/
[16:34:33] <nsosa> taplar: I have the 'apellido' text field, I want just to send that one with  a focusout function as you see in the code. But when I submit it is sending the whole form
[16:34:35] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nrxebs8w/
[16:35:01] <nsosa> taplar: I'm doing this var queryString = $('#apellido').fieldSerialize();
[16:35:09] <robertmaxrees> nsosa that's now how you do that.
[16:35:21] <nsosa> but I don't think I'm sending that querystring var anywhere
[16:35:23] <robertmaxrees> querystring is the value you want to submit.
[16:35:35] <nsosa> yes, but how do I send it
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> you should do that as apart of your options in your focusout.
[16:35:57] <nsosa> robertmaxrees can you please check the code and tell me what line is wroing ?https://jsfiddle.net/hur7kq09/
[16:36:10] <robertmaxrees> i looked.
[16:36:13] <robertmaxrees> var queryString = $('#apellido').fieldSerialize();
[16:36:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to do that before the ajaxsubmit and then pass it in.
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that plugin so you'll need ot look at the docs.
[16:36:31] <nsosa> how do I pass it in to the ajaxsubmit?
[16:36:55] <robertmaxrees> per the ajaxSubmit docs here: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api "Note: You can pass any of the standard $.ajax options to ajaxSubmit"
[16:37:27] <robertmaxrees> so check the jquery ajax docs :)
[16:37:47] <nsosa> yes I think ineed to check the ajax docs
[16:37:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:38:05] <nsosa> beacuse I have no idea how the ajaxsubmit function is doing it behind the scenes
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> so your focusout will do the var queryString = $('#apellido').fieldSerialize(); and then you'll pass that wherever you need it.
[16:38:43] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what extra stuff this plugin is giving you.
[16:38:50] <nsosa> robert: yes that's the part I need to figure it out
[16:39:04] <nsosa> robert: I was using that plugin because I was having problems uploading files through ajax to the server
[16:39:05] <taplar> idk but i'd assume it cancels the event, grabs the action and method from the form, serializes it, and ajax's it
[16:39:09] <nsosa> and that plugin works very well
[16:39:14] <nsosa> to send the whole form
[16:39:20] <robertmaxrees> that sounds really silly.
[16:39:22] <robertmaxrees> but oK :)
[16:39:42] <nsosa> which part sounds silly?
[16:39:58] <robertmaxrees> that plugin doesn't really seem to add anything on top of the base ajax method in jquery.
[16:40:08] <robertmaxrees> just gives you a slightly different, more convoluted API.
[16:40:36] <nsosa> hmm... I don't know why when  I tried to upload files it gave me an empty dictionary on django
[16:40:43] <nsosa> but it worked with the plugin
[16:41:01] <nsosa> well I guess I need to read more! :)
[16:41:02] <robertmaxrees> heh, i would've just ficed the ajax call, but to each their own :)
[16:41:37] <taplar> yeah it really seems like a "you don't know ajax?  but you want to do ajax?  you just need a form!" plugin
[16:41:57] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't actually bring anything substantive to the table as far as I can tell.  it just munges the API.
[16:42:11] <robertmaxrees> and makes it harder to do some pretty common things.
[16:42:23] <nsosa> well, let me then continue working on my original idea without the plugin
[16:42:32] <nsosa> and I will come back for more answers :)
[16:42:51] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: name of a select should be #nameseton= ?
[16:42:56] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY huh?
[16:42:56] <taplar> nsosa: if your wanting to send only parts, there's the serializeObject() method that you can use
[16:43:02] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY "name of a select"?
[16:43:07] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: select name="foo"
[16:43:08] <taplar> which you can use in conjunction with $.ajax
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY # is for IDs.
[16:43:18] <robertmaxrees> not names.
[16:43:22] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: name is . ?
[16:43:27] <robertmaxrees> . is class.
[16:43:31] <YamakasY> oh indeed
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> there's no siomple selector for names.
[16:43:35] <taplar> [name=""]
[16:43:36] <robertmaxrees> give it a class or an id.
[16:43:44] <YamakasY> taplar: yap
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> avoid attribute selectors if possible.
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> though they exist.
[16:43:49] <taplar> yup
[16:43:51] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok
[16:43:51] <nsosa> I'll be back !! thanks guys
[16:45:12] <YamakasY> kewl guys!
[16:45:35] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I'm to tired again to "remember the" . # whatever :)
[16:45:41] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:45:46] <robertmaxrees> those should be second nature by now.
[16:45:48] <robertmaxrees> same as in CSS>
[16:45:55] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: can't help it, hard bang in a car once
[16:46:06] <taplar> write it down, stick it on your wall, :P
[16:46:13] <robertmaxrees> the ability to use css selectors in jquery was a big early selling point.
[16:46:16] <YamakasY> I tattoo it :)
[16:46:25] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I know
[16:46:50] <YamakasY> but sorry guys, I can, and should be, happy I'm stil alive since then
[16:46:55] <YamakasY> *still
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.  might be a good idea to nab yourself a cheat sheet.
[16:47:32] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: it's the other way around, I learned to NEVER give up
[16:47:37] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what i just suggested.
[16:47:44] <YamakasY> yap
[16:47:50] <robertmaxrees> nothing wrong with cheat sheets.
[16:47:55] <YamakasY> oh
[16:47:58] <YamakasY> that
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> they're really common.

[16:50:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: joking ;)
[16:50:32] <YamakasY> it;s pretty ackward what kind of mess they make there
[16:50:54] <robertmaxrees> oh.,  dude wasn't actually handicapped?
[16:51:08] <YamakasY> nope

[16:52:07] <YamakasY> ;)
[16:52:15] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're talking about, but OK.
[16:52:18] <taplar> weird thing to do in a shower room
[16:52:18] <YamakasY> you have to believe in yourself
[16:52:37] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: you never hug yourself ?
[16:52:55] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i'm really lost about what's going on now.
[16:54:04] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: about what I said, people try to act to be always right in a crowd by doing these things, when it happened they are a bastard themself again
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> can we get back on topic?
[16:54:27] <YamakasY> it's like with selfies, on a photo everyone looks perfect ;) so I ment...
[16:54:35] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: on jquery would be ok ;)
[16:54:59] <YamakasY> but thanks guys
[16:55:02] * YamakasY hugs robertmaxrees 
[16:55:16] <YamakasY> and taplar ;)
[17:13:16] <YamakasY> whe I have #CANDY=RED&foo=bar and I need to split on = but also on & to get foo out. can I split on both @ the same time ?
[17:14:40] <robertmaxrees> just parse the url.
[17:14:50] <arosen12> Is there a way to use $('body').delegate for handing droppable events on items in jquery?
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[17:15:04] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 so .delegate() is deprecated.  you want .on() instead.
[17:15:13] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 and yes, you should be able to.
[17:15:20] <YamakasY> mhh I can get the = parts out but that means also foo=bar as one
[17:15:33] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY right, but it's much smarter to actually parse it into an object.
[17:15:59] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: sure, will check that link out
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, .split() and then .map()
[17:16:49] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, what would map do than ? foo gets mapped to var or so ?
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what .map() does?
[17:17:28] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  how do i specify the options with on? $(".droppable-items").on('droppable', {drop: function() {}, activeClass: ...}) ?
[17:17:49] <YamakasY> I can make it an array that way
[17:17:58] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 check out the docs :) very similar to delegate.
[17:19:00] <YamakasY> I wonder actually if I can check if my var matches any value from a dropdown, that woud be better and make an if/else on it
[17:19:04] <YamakasY> *would
[17:19:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:20:05] <YamakasY> yeah if I have a var = foo; and I have a select with foo, bar,candy as values... can I loop through it and see if foo exists in it ?
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:21:16] <YamakasY> oeh that would be awesome, but does it need to be a function or can I just "do" it ?
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're saying at this point.
[17:21:38] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[17:21:52] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: can I just loop through that select @ any point ?
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:22:02] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:22:06] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn;t you be able to?
[17:22:26] <YamakasY> dunno how realtime it can be done :)
[17:22:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> "realtime"?
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> you just want to confirm the select has that option available, right?
[17:23:14] <YamakasY> yes, that it doesn't have to be called but can be done anywhere in my script
[17:23:19] <YamakasY> yes
[17:23:25] <robertmaxrees> you should absolutely abstract that into a function.
[17:23:29] <robertmaxrees> and then call that function.
[17:23:30] <YamakasY> and make an if/else on it
[17:23:45] <DeafGoose> Hi guys, Im trying to bind a custom event on dynamic created elements, but I cant get it to trigger, can anyone help? http://pastebin.com/ffWsvBU4
[17:23:48] <YamakasY> could be done
[17:23:55] <robertmaxrees> DeafGoose you want a delegated listener.
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> also, on only takes one function.
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> not two.
[17:24:47] <DeafGoose> robertmaxrees, how would I go about?
[17:24:53] <robertmaxrees> "clickToggle"?
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> where's this coming from,?
[17:25:09] <DeafGoose> I have it as a jquery function...here is what it looks like
[17:25:28] <DeafGoose> http://pastebin.com/R5wSLVN9
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use events.
[17:26:10] <robertmaxrees> .on('clickToggle') is listening for that event.  you're not triggering that event anywhere.
[17:26:26] <DeafGoose> hmm
[17:27:15] <robertmaxrees> what you've got extends $ - $(').clickToggle
[17:28:22] <DeafGoose> $('.btn-ranking').clickToggle(function() {... doesnt do anything either
[17:28:33] <DeafGoose> when they are dynamically created
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:28:48] <robertmaxrees> you have to bind that afrer they're created or use a normal event listener.
[17:29:33] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: hrm i have this but it doesn't seem to be working :( http://codepad.org/P16SLSho
[17:29:46] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 you didn't read the docs ;)
[17:30:09] <robertmaxrees>  $("body").on('event', ".breadcrumb-draggable", function() {});
[17:30:47] <DeafGoose> ok robert thanks
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> DeafGoose make sense?
[17:30:55] <DeafGoose> after they are created, it works
[17:30:58] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  yea i tried that but how do i pass in the drop method activeClass, etc that way?
[17:30:59] <DeafGoose> yea now it does
[17:31:06] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 you can't.
[17:31:31] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 you can look at the objects that get passed in if you want.
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> but those are different from the handlers you bind directly onto the instances.
[17:33:14] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  hrm so in my case i need to dynamically add and remove these events from different objects as i want them. I can't use a generic  delegate as i was doing before and apply that to the class?
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 show me what you were doing before?
[17:35:33] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  currently I'm doing:  $("#" + id).droppable( {})  as i load an item on the page that are droppable.  But instead i just wanted to do something like:     $('body').delegate('.droppable-item', 'click', function (e) { } )   this way i didn't need to have logic to add the droppable for every element as it loads.
[17:36:19] <robertmaxrees> right, so you're convoluting two things.
[17:36:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean that when it's added, you want to automatically initialize it, right?
[17:36:37] <arosen12> correct
[17:36:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't do that.
[17:36:57] <arosen12> i want to be able to do  $("#blah").addClass("droppable-item")
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> there's no event for "i added a thing i want to be droppable".
[17:37:03] <arosen12> and then have it be droppable :)
[17:37:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can't do that.
[17:37:10] <robertmaxrees> need to initialize it.
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> which should be fine.  just moves where that logic sits.
[17:37:27] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I did it, using an if and loop through it :D
[17:37:40] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY grats.
[17:37:44] <YamakasY> thanks!
[17:37:45] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  cool, thanks for the info.
[17:38:01] <YamakasY> your help is great here guys, just the small pieces don't stop you from going further
[17:39:48] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  how do i remove the droppable action from an object though? I tried $("#foo").unbind('droppable') but no lunck.
[17:39:51] <arosen12> luck*
[17:40:15] <robertmaxrees> have you looked at the API docs?
[17:40:40] <robertmaxrees> because .unbind() is for events, not destroying a widget
[17:41:31] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  cool, i got it working. Should have looked closer at the docs.
[17:41:38] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 :) it's all good.
[17:41:38] <arosen12> thanks again for your help!
[17:41:54] <robertmaxrees> deffo!
[18:20:18] <AshleyHuman> hi I've been trying to learn jQuery and I made this test app that gives me an error: http://pastebin.com/Hxbf3mTD
[18:20:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't put anything between </body> and </html>
[18:20:52] <AshleyHuman> I get the weather using this API and try to write it to my table cells: http://openweathermap.org/current
[18:21:04] <robertmaxrees> whjat's the error you're getting?
[18:21:46] <AshleyHuman> this http://pastebin.com/uY0Aanaa
[18:22:09] <robertmaxrees> getJSON() probably isn't the right call then.
[18:22:15] <robertmaxrees> try using $.ajax() instea.d
[18:22:52] <AshleyHuman> hmm I think I might be missing some tags
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:23:28] <robertmaxrees> oh and $("document")
[18:23:29] <AshleyHuman> I fixed the missing </td> and I moved the </body> to after my script... still get the same error
[18:23:34] <robertmaxrees> you want $(document)
[18:23:34] <AshleyHuman> how do I use $.ajax?
[18:23:45] <AshleyHuman> ohh
[18:24:56] <AshleyHuman> or like why isn't getJSON working
[18:25:06] <AshleyHuman> why does it give me a syntax error of all things?
[18:25:13] <AshleyHuman> it doesn't say it was deprecated or anything
[18:25:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:25:19] <robertmaxrees> it's not deprecated.
[18:25:41] <AshleyHuman> hmm... what's wrong with my code D:
[18:27:07] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:27:22] <AshleyHuman> I fixed a few things but the real problem seems to be on the lines that deal with the JSON
[18:27:27] <AshleyHuman> namely the parseJSON ones
[18:27:33] <robertmaxrees> right, the real issue is the response.
[18:27:42] <AshleyHuman> that's what I thought
[18:27:43] <robertmaxrees> the getJSON is expecting something it's not getting.
[18:28:00] <robertmaxrees> but slow down, it may be that you're doing something wrong.
[18:28:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's erroring.
[18:28:49] <AshleyHuman> hmm
[18:29:30] <robertmaxrees> you sure this is something you can call in-browser?
[18:29:47] <robertmaxrees> might be a CORS problem.
[18:30:03] <AshleyHuman> as in the parseJSON and getJSON functions? I don't know...
[18:30:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:30:16] <robertmaxrees> as in the OWM
[18:30:17] <AshleyHuman> the API?
[18:30:20] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:30:29] <AshleyHuman> well I know I can manually load the JSON in my browser
[18:30:38] <AshleyHuman> browse to the given link to confirm
[18:30:39] <robertmaxrees> right, but CORS may be an issue.
[18:30:45] <AshleyHuman> what's CORS?
[18:31:07] <robertmaxrees> basically it's what prevents me from using ajax to read your email.
[18:31:13] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[18:31:19] <robertmaxrees> but that might not be the issue.
[18:31:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  let me try something.
[18:33:15] <b1101> I'm trying to serialize() checkboxes that are deeply nested within unsorted lists within divs of divs. This is obviously causing issues as serialize() isn't working. Any suggestions?
[18:34:03] <robertmaxrees> AshleyHuman https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6822a504/ try something like this on your page.
[18:34:15] <robertmaxrees> b1101 can you show us what you're seeing?
[18:34:49] <robertmaxrees> AshleyHuman also: you're running this from a server, right?
[18:35:15] <AshleyHuman> robertmaxrees: no, I just wrote the html and opened it in chrome with ctrl-o
[18:35:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to setup a local dev server.
[18:35:34] <AshleyHuman> is that the problem robertmaxrees?
[18:35:41] <robertmaxrees> that might be apart of the issue?
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm honestly not sure.
[18:35:57] <AshleyHuman> hmm I don't see why... I'm just doing client side stuff
[18:36:12] <robertmaxrees> partof the browser trying to protect you ;)
[18:36:28] <AshleyHuman> heh :)
[18:36:38] <AshleyHuman> thanks for the ajax snippet, I'll give that a try then
[18:37:20] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, search the interwebs
[18:40:12] <AshleyHuman> robertmaxrees: I think the JSON was already an object is why... console log prints out the JSON just fine with your ajax snippet :)
[18:40:14] <AshleyHuman> thanks
[18:40:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:40:37] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's nto all.
[18:40:59] <robertmaxrees> if the jsonp datatype fixed it it's trying to use a slightly different format. check your network tab and see what the raw response is.
[18:42:47] <b1101> robertmaxrees: I pretty much cloned the dropdowns from a site. I have a page that looks like this. I'm trying to grab all the checkboxes with serialize() https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0dd4eb0b34696630a1e4
[18:42:59] <robertmaxrees> is that in a form?
[18:43:13] <b1101> no
[18:43:29] <b1101> it's a div with divs of ul's that have checkboxes
[18:43:45] <robertmaxrees> right, sooo https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:43:54] <b1101> has to be a form?
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> need to either select the inputs specifically or target a form.
[18:44:31] <b1101> any suggestsion of turning this entire page into a form?
[18:44:41] <b1101> I need dropdowns though
[18:50:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:51:10] <robertmaxrees> you can have dropdowns in forms.
[18:51:33] <robertmaxrees> literally just pop form tags around it or select the inputs directly.
[18:52:03] <robertmaxrees> $('.dropdown-menu input').serialize();
[18:52:33] <robertmaxrees> that should work, too.
[18:53:51] <b1101> that doesn't
[18:57:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:57:41] <b1101> I think something about the ul's screws things up
[18:57:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't think so.
[18:57:49] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter.
[18:58:01] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:58:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:07] <robertmaxrees> the inputs don't have names.
[18:58:13] <b1101> mine do :P
[18:58:23] <robertmaxrees> them the gist is inaccurate?
[18:58:46] <b1101> no it is, it's just not my code. excluding giving them names though it's identical
[18:58:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:59:02] <robertmaxrees> could you provide an accurate gist then?
[18:59:07] <robertmaxrees> with names on the inputs?
[19:00:23] <robertmaxrees> modifying your markup to use names instead of IDs gets it to work: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2jduc75m/
[19:00:25] <b1101> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a46dfd10dfd8092f9b2d this is a div that lives within a large div
[19:00:41] <robertmaxrees> you're still missing names.
[19:00:44] <robertmaxrees> the inputs need name attributes.
[19:00:48] <robertmaxrees> not the labels.
[19:01:29] <b1101> wow...wow.....
[19:01:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:01:48] <b1101> I wasted so much time last night looking at this
[19:01:59] <b1101> fml...thx though :D
[19:02:10] <robertmaxrees> heh.  it's all good.
[19:31:17] <Mark_____> im trying to create loading spinner thatdisappears when the contents are loaded. can anyone help me out? https://jsfiddle.net/waynk734/1/
[19:31:45] <robertmaxrees> when WHAT contents are loaded?
[19:31:47] <robertmaxrees> an iframe?
[19:34:20] <robertmaxrees> Mark_____ ^
[19:34:29] <Mark_____> yes.
[19:34:35] <Mark_____> to be specfiic,
[19:34:43] <Mark_____> the contents that are loaded inside the iframe.
[19:34:53] <Mark_____> here’s live site : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[19:34:58] <robertmaxrees> soooo load events are a funky thing.
[19:35:10] <acidjazz> you cant really do that Mark_____
[19:35:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:35:17] <Mark_____> hmm..
[19:35:19] <Mark_____> i can't?
[19:35:22] <acidjazz> you dont have access to handlers inside the iframe
[19:35:25] <acidjazz> for security purposes
[19:35:27] <Mark_____> someone told me differently.
[19:35:32] <robertmaxrees> he can access the load event outside though.
[19:35:34] <Mark_____> yaeh that’s whati thought.
[19:35:37] <Mark_____> that’s what i thought.
[19:35:38] <robertmaxrees> your current code is weir.d
[19:35:41] <acidjazz> from w/in?
[19:35:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:35:50] <robertmaxrees> you're binding the handler multiple times.
[19:35:56] <Mark_____> hmm.....
[19:36:06] <Mark_____> so i shall i go about this
[19:36:10] <Mark_____> *how
[19:36:32] <robertmaxrees> do you control the contents of the iframe?>
[19:36:48] <Mark_____> yes.
[19:36:51] <Mark_____> so,
[19:37:01] <robertmaxrees> you can trigger functions in the parent window then.
[19:37:04] <robertmaxrees> same domain?
[19:37:09] <Mark_____> yes.
[19:37:14] <Mark_____> if you visit the site here http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[19:37:17] <Mark_____> and click onthe last menu,
[19:37:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then you can directly call a function formthe parent frame.
[19:37:30] <Mark_____> i made it so that, the src of the iframe changes
[19:37:31] <robertmaxrees> err, from the child frame
[19:37:34] <acidjazz> so he'll have the iframe trigger the loader from w/in to sto pit
[19:37:35] <Mark_____> when clicking the button.
[19:37:57] <Mark_____> can you help me with the coding a bit?
[19:37:57] <robertmaxrees> just call the function from the iframe contents.
[19:38:21] <Mark_____> you mean i have to implant the code inside the iframe?
[19:38:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:38:32] <robertmaxrees> you'll have code in both places.
[19:38:39] <Mark_____> hmm...
[19:38:45] <robertmaxrees> window.parent <- this is your parent frame.
[19:39:54] <Mark_____> what’s window.parent? i don’t have that on my html
[19:40:15] <robertmaxrees> it's the parent window.
[19:40:16] <Mark_____> some people keep telling me i have to use
[19:40:20] <Mark_____> promises
[19:40:21] <robertmaxrees> it's in the JS.
[19:40:26] <Mark_____> okay, so..
[19:40:32] <robertmaxrees> promises are not something i'd use hee.
[19:40:34] <robertmaxrees> *here
[19:41:59] <Mark_____> im lost though, i can’t just go about like this : jQuery('window.parent').on('load', function () {
[19:42:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:42:13] <robertmaxrees> window.parent.$ is your new $
[19:42:37] <Mark_____> which means?
[19:42:39] <robertmaxrees> you have to explicitly access the parent scope.
[19:42:45] <robertmaxrees> and you don''t want load.
[19:42:51] <robertmaxrees> ignore events :) you don't need them.
[19:43:00] <Mark_____> hmm......
[19:43:21] <robertmaxrees> window.parent.jQuery('.loader_container').hide();
[19:43:22] <Mark_____> what you are saying slightly give me the feeling that
[19:43:34] <Mark_____> it’s just going to be a spinner that disappears after the content load is done
[19:43:36] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that the load event is a big PITA to get right.
[19:44:09] <robertmaxrees> granted, this is all kind of strange to begin with - i wouldn't use iframes to load page sections and loading animations are best ot be avoided.
[19:45:06] <Mark_____> i have no choice. i used ajax before with the same technique but it just won’t work with mycurrent CMS
[19:46:54] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  why do you want animations?
[19:46:59] <robertmaxrees> users are fine if they see things load.
[19:47:08] <robertmaxrees> fix up your assets to make them less heavy and you're fine.
[19:48:31] <Mark_____> im trying.
[19:49:06] <Mark_____> im still stuck with my current coding lol im only a starter at jquery.
[19:49:50] <Mark_____> https://jsfiddle.net/waynk734/2/
[19:50:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:50:10] <robertmaxrees> window.parent.jQuery('.loader_container').hide(); goes inside the iframe code.
[19:50:39] <minh> hi, I have a question related to jquery. In a html file how do I load the jquery functionality into a variable like node js do?
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:51:12] <robertmaxrees> minh that it's already in a variable.
[19:51:23] <minh> i dont want it to be global
[19:51:42] <robertmaxrees> what module loader are you using then?
[19:52:01] <minh> i want to be able to do this "var myJquery = new Jquery(window);
[19:52:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can't do that.
[19:52:15] <minh> why not?
[19:52:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery by default loads globally.
[19:52:21] <minh> node js can do it..
[19:52:31] <minh> with var $ = require("jquery")..
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> right, so you're using a module loader.
[19:53:01] <b4b> sup jquery nerds?
[19:53:10] <b4b> whats the best way to make the user notice an element
[19:53:14] <b4b> any plugins for this purpose?
[19:53:22] <robertmaxrees> b4b that;'s more of a design question.
[19:53:37] <minh> do u know any module loader? for plain html file?
[19:53:49] <robertmaxrees> minh it's more more complex than that.
[19:53:55] <robertmaxrees> require.js is an option.
[19:54:45] <Mark_____> one quick question , though this isn’ css channel, is it viable if i use .show() on a div that’s set display:none?
[19:54:49] <minh> well i modify the jquery file to make it happen but it kinda hassle
[19:55:00] <robertmaxrees> minh that's a terrible idea as well.
[19:55:08] <robertmaxrees> Mark_____ you can do that.
[19:55:13] <robertmaxrees> minh why do you need it scoped like that?
[19:55:23] <minh> so if i define a js library
[19:55:42] <robertmaxrees> why is having it global a problem?
[19:55:43] <minh> i will have control which dependency it require and which that js file can use
[19:56:03] <minh> so all my js file will be self contains
[19:56:15] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need require.js
[19:56:20] <minh> and all the dependcy will be injected
[19:56:22] <robertmaxrees> that's what it does for you.
[19:56:36] <minh> and it will work with normal javascript?
[19:56:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:56:51] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it?
[19:57:00] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you'll need to properly expose your modules.
[19:57:08] <robertmaxrees> but it solves the problem you want to solve.
[19:57:33] <minh> sweet thank! i think that what i try to look for but dont know how to google thank you so much!
[20:00:24] <Mark_____> quick question : what have i done wrong? jQuery(document).on('click', '.menu_a', function() {
[20:00:24] <Mark_____>     jQuery('.loader_container').addClass('show');
[20:00:35] <Mark_____> somehow show() didnt work,
