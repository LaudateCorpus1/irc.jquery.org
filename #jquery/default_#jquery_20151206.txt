[00:01:13] <on1x> fun
[00:01:19] <on1x> alert works on my project
[00:01:25] <on1x> but the code you just fixed for me don
[00:01:26] <on1x> haha
[00:04:10] <on1x> *dont
[00:04:19] <WhirledPress> I don't think you get it. Here it is with alert. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/9jj7k4h8/10/
[00:05:30] <on1x> really
[00:05:45] <on1x> i really dont understand js
[00:05:48] <on1x> for real
[00:06:21] <WhirledPress> console.log() is just like alert except that it outputs to the log rather than making you stop what you are doing and respond to a dialog box
[00:06:22] <on1x> wth is wrong with my project grr
[00:06:25] <on1x> i know
[00:06:29] <on1x> hold on
[00:06:30] <on1x> sec
[00:09:44] <on1x> take a look
[00:09:46] <on1x> http://pastebin.com/iKnU49BP
[00:10:33] <WhirledPress> You are executing your code before the dom is ready. So there are no elements to select.
[00:10:43] <on1x> oh
[00:10:55] <on1x> now makes sense
[00:10:58] <WhirledPress> try putting this before your script (inside the script tag)
[00:11:10] <WhirledPress> $(document).ready(function () {
[00:11:32] <WhirledPress> then put }); after your script, right before the closing script tag
[00:11:55] <WhirledPress> that ensures that the document is ready before tring to select items.
[00:11:55] <on1x> works just fine
[00:12:13] <on1x> i thought this code would only execute when iv clicked
[00:13:23] <WhirledPress> you have to assign the click handler function to an element to get it to do anything. If the element hasn't rendered, you can't select it to apply handlers to it.
[00:18:34] <on1x> ok
[00:18:40] <on1x> got it working
[00:18:52] <on1x> many thanks WhirledPress for the amazing help
[00:19:00] <on1x> :P
[00:19:01] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm using an ajax get request and while this works to output the data via console.log I'm unsure (still learning) why it's not applying the class? $.get(..., function( data ) { if (!$( data )) { $("#runinfobox").addClass("runinfoboxactive"), console.log(data);} It outputs what's contained in the file to the console but it doesn't seem to interact with the #runinfobox id at all?
[00:20:23] <alturic> sorry about the syntax typos. Just gave a snippet, syntax is correct in the code.
[00:23:27] <alturic> erm. I think i see my problem.... derp.
[00:24:41] <WhirledPress> alturic, please don't paste code here. Paste it in any testbed like jsfiddle or codepen.
[01:11:23] <WhirledPress> how do you determine if an element is in a jquery object. I thought $(list).has("elem") but no.
[01:22:36] <Audlex> hasClass
[01:23:32] <Audlex> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[01:31:46] <WhirledPress> contains...thanks.
[01:55:02] <supahot> what's up
[01:58:27] <Mark_____> does anyone know a way to load a jquery plugin faster? right now, there’s  about 2sec delays of loading one particular js plugin. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_iBLY65
[02:15:59] <WhirledPress> anybody have a preferred jquery form validator?
[02:45:17] <WhirledPress> Why can't jsfiddle throw console errors with the right line numbers?
[03:47:26] <veek> does jquery have it's own grammer
[03:57:55] <rcyr> ...
[03:58:12] <rcyr> jQuery is written in JS... I'll let you guess the answer.
[04:00:48] <veek> rcyr, i get that - it's a library but surely grammer can be implemented using JS vs BNF
[04:01:37] <veek> rcyr, wanted to know if they had two grammers one for JS and then for jQuery
[05:49:24] <Matt____> Hey can anyone help me
[05:49:29] <Matt____> here with this http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/L3u91uzu/15/
[06:00:56] <Matt____> anyone here xd
[06:05:36] <Kars-T> Huuhuuu :D
[06:08:17] <Matt____> do you got time to help me
[06:09:30] <Matt____> Hey
[06:12:01] <shoky> Matt____:  username.strong  means  <username class="strong">    :P
[06:13:58] <Matt____> this I know
[06:14:08] <Matt____> what I'm trying to achieve is fet the username eg Max Pen or Demo
[06:14:16] <Matt____> but the first one it finds when you select a text
[06:14:46] <shoky> you're setting a global variable in a loop currently.. so it'll end up with the last name
[06:14:51] <Matt____> and then it enters that like [quote="Max Pen"]text here[/quote]
[06:15:09] <Matt____> well can you help me fix it?
[06:15:19] <shoky> you need to fetch the username after the mouseup happens, only then you can know which user to quote, no?
[06:15:26] <Matt____> yes
[06:15:27] <Matt____> true
[06:15:34] <shoky> so do it in the mouseup handler, for starters
[06:15:55] <shoky> $(this)  will get you the clicked element
[06:16:33] <shoky> $(this).closest('strong.username')  will go up from the clicked element to find the container <strong>
[06:16:40] <shoky> think you can take it from there
[06:18:00] <Matt____> http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/L3u91uzu/18/
[06:18:07] <Matt____> the problem I have is that the variable is undefined
[06:18:13] <Matt____> I tried moving it after the mouseup function
[06:18:28] <shoky> why after?
[06:18:49] <shoky> you need this to happen as a result of the mouseup. so it needs to happen INSIDE the mouseup listener
[06:19:05] <shoky> things you put after the mouseup listener will get run on page load, not after mouseup
[06:19:39] <shoky> and you don't need any global variable for this, just a local var is good
[06:19:42] <shoky> var username = ...;
[06:19:52] <Matt____> ok
[06:21:10] <Matt____> http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/L3u91uzu/19/
[06:21:35] <Matt____> no work though
[06:22:03] <shoky> yea i see the <strong> isn't actually the container of the .content elements
[06:22:30] <shoky> you should give the post divs a class
[06:22:36] <shoky> like class="post"
[06:23:52] <Matt____> nope
[06:23:53] <shoky> and then  you can do $(this).closest('.post').find('a.username').text()
[06:24:15] <shoky> like this  http://jsfiddle.net/L3u91uzu/20/
[06:24:55] <Matt____> thank you
[06:25:01] <shoky> yw
[06:27:27] <Matt____> right
[07:29:15] <veek> what does he mean by 'Th  is fi lter returns only one,
[07:29:15] <veek> and it’s based on the index within the selector set that you choose.'
[07:29:28] <veek> he's talking about :first
[07:32:32] <ant___> hey guys weirdiest jquery every  I'm running the standard jquery css display it works however the markup isn't changing within the console it prints the node with the news css property however the markup isn't showing the change https://monosnap.com/file/DLmHKqkeK0DznJIRVCpdi8LeDAPoNj

[07:36:53] <Vivekananda> hi everyone. Can someone point me an example of how to load multiple source data files for js/jquery?
[07:38:21] <Vivekananda> I also need to find a good way of putting in variables instead of hard coded values in html so I can substitute variables later. Are there good fast ways of doing this ?
[07:41:52] <marrenarre> ant___: Link to page?
[07:42:27] <marrenarre> Vivekananda: Maybe look into Angular?
[07:42:27] <ant___> no worries I'm being dumb dulipcated the page
[07:43:39] <Vivekananda> marrenarre, umm I simply need to feed in data. Do you think just for that I should learn a whole new architecture ?
[07:44:03] <marrenarre> Vivekananda: Maybe not. I dunno.
[07:44:21] <Vivekananda> oo :)
[07:44:36] <Vivekananda> do you know how to substitute variable values in pure html ?
[07:45:19] <marrenarre> If you want to change attribute values, you need JavaScript.
[07:50:57] <Vivekananda> yeah I know that. I am trying to figure out if there are other ways to replace values in html. One is surely js. What are other ways. eg one way is to echo a php variable inside anywhere eg <?php echo myName >  and this will echo that value anywhere I put it in html
[07:55:08] <marrenarre> I thought you meant client-side specifically.
[07:55:36] <Vivekananda> yeah it is client side.
[07:56:14] <Vivekananda> so currently my client html will get values from a client data file. Later I have to write data To the data file from the server
[07:59:18] <marrenarre> Vivekananda: Yes but that's not jQuery.
[08:00:03] <Vivekananda> the part about loading the data into the client html + js/jquery is the jquery part I am dealing with now
[08:51:20] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[08:51:31] <Vivekananda> I am looking at this --https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Loading-external-files:-AJAX,-XML,-JSON
[08:51:40] <Vivekananda> can someone suggest better tools to load data
[09:10:07] <kdehl> I have two sortable connected lists. I wish to reorganize this a bit, and make one list non-sortable, but have its items draggable to the second list, where the items are sortable. Also, I don't want the items in the first list to go away when they are dragged into the second list. That is, one should be able to drag the same item twice.
[09:10:50] <kdehl> Anyone wants to give me some pointers for this?
[09:11:14] <kdehl> This is the page I'm working on: http://david.dose.se/maps/infrastructure/admin.html
[09:11:50] <kdehl> Right now I can drag items from Points to Line, but I want them to remain in Points even after they are dragged over.
[09:12:30] <kdehl> Uh. I just realized I can keep reloading the Points list from the database each time I drag an item into Line. It's kinda ugly though.
[12:00:02] <halletwx> I'm using something simple like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2f8q2cqe/ to replace a broken image on a dynamitcally changing imgsrc in a gallery. It fires for the first broken image, but if you tried selecting the previous broken image it doesn't fire again and instead tries returning the real img src again.
[14:10:03] <Voyage> can I send/manipulate requests of the page INSIDE iframe from OUTSIDE the iframe and send a post request ?  e.g I open google.com inside an iframe and write javascript outside the iframe to  hit a submit button or do an ajax call to google? (suppose google allows that)
[14:10:57] <snover> no, that would be an enormous security vulnerability.
[14:11:28] <Voyage> it would be but can I?
[14:11:45] <snover> think for two seconds about what you are asking. “can stealmoney.com make an iframe for mybank.com and hit a submit button inside the iframe?” of course not
[14:11:46] <Voyage> snover,  well an iframe is just a node in dom
[14:12:27] <Voyage> snover,  well an iframe is just a node in dom and you can make hit button / form submit events and field input values in javascript. no?
[14:12:37] <snover> good luck!
[14:13:17] <Voyage> Iam not here for luck or stealing bank money (no one comes to mycustomeurl.com instead of theXbank.com). Iam here to learn
[14:13:25] <Voyage> and implement for a project
[14:14:52] <casaper> Voyage, why do you ask in two channels at a time?
[14:15:12] <Voyage> casaper,  I have to tell all details of my project
[14:15:14] <casaper> Voyage, the same question notably
[14:15:24] <Voyage> casaper,  less answers?
[14:15:59] <casaper> you've litterally copy pasted the same question to ##javascript
[14:16:02] <casaper> no?
[14:16:10] <Voyage> casaper,  yes
[14:16:24] <Voyage> more audience?
[14:16:56] <casaper> shall all "audience" keep that in mind in case your "audience" is considering to help you next time
[14:27:00] <kdehl> Hi. I have made an autocomplete search thingy. I now want to make the list scroll to the right index when the user clicks a found item in the search box.
[14:27:03] <kdehl> http://david.dose.se/maps/infrastructure/admin.html
[14:27:22] <kdehl> It's just that I don't understand the syntax, basically.
[14:27:28] <kdehl> https://paste.kde.org/phlduccrq
[16:57:48] <Vivekananda> Can someone tell me what is wrong with this https://jsfiddle.net/svommrr5/2/
[17:01:48] <Vivekananda> sorry I changed it https://jsfiddle.net/svommrr5/4/
[17:23:39] <Vivekananda> hi
[17:25:45] <Vivekananda> anyone around
[17:26:08] <sillyslux> .
[17:40:10] <shoky> Vivekananda: you never call changeG.. it's getElementById..    innerHTML is not a function
[18:01:09] <jangoh> Vivekananda https://jsfiddle.net/4byasbq3/
[18:05:31] <jangoh> Note you need to set the javascript load type to <no wrap in head>
[19:05:11] <andrew-chappell> Hello there! Has anyone got a solution for me. I inherited an JQuery Mobile App, that has a multi page template that fetches data via query string requests to an external server and loads them. However, I'm getting unrecognized expression syntax errors when trying to use the back button
[19:05:53] <andrew-chappell> Seems that jQuery mobile doesn't support query strings... but maybe someone has a workaround
[20:32:20] <Audlex> html() returns & as &amp; how can I prevent this?
[20:33:56] <Audlex> by using text() is would seem
[20:33:57] <Audlex> nevermind
[22:38:21] <hexdj> is there a way to target a class knowing the first few letters?
[23:06:47] <dekeneus> Is there an iterator similar with '.each', which loops infinitely through all the elements? Can anyone suggest a workaround for this?
[23:06:53] <dekeneus> similar to*
