[02:35:45] <W0LF> I'm having what I think is a js error on my frontpage for unlogged in users - once you log in all the js works correctly - kobejet.com
[02:36:14] <W0LF> i've inspected console in chrome and it looks like something with the back to top module, but don't know where to proceed past that
[02:36:46] <W0LF> it's a new error, before back to top was working fine for anonymous users, so i think it's something else i've done or changed in a menu perhaps?
[02:39:10] <Uhkis> clearly a drupal-side problem, go ask in #drupal or #drupal-support

[05:00:19] <batsol> hello everybody
[05:01:04] <batsol> I struggle with removing subnodes from an element created using parseHTML function
[05:02:41] <batsol> I want to load HTML dynamically, and verify if the scripts are already there or not, so I want to remove first all the nodes like <script src="jquery.js">
[05:03:07] <batsol> to load it only if they have not been loaded yet
[05:04:11] <batsol> you can have a look at what i already tried here: https://pastebin.com/VZ70kJcQ
[05:24:49] <batsol> ok, I found a workaround, I first do the parsing with node=$.parseHTML(data,document,false) and then I append js manually using node=$.parseHTML(data,document,true) .... $("#"+divId).append(this)
[05:53:46] <sonnie> hi there, i have been struggling on jwplayer for hours... Have to call help now. Please tell me why IE8 throws a 'jwplayer is not defined' error?  URL: http://lib.ustc.edu.cn/freshmen/t.html
[06:55:24] <rapha> hi!
[06:55:49] <rapha> in https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/0b6a0198c4c770b47f5a3d3e89998430 , why does the setTimeout fire _once_ for all the <a>'s and not individually, <a> by <a>?
[06:56:21] <rapha> (I've also played around with .delay(), both inside and out the asynchronous .get(), but everything I try, it always fires all at once)
[07:00:41] <Uhkis> it does fire multiple times, but milliseconds apart :p
[07:04:35] <rapha> Uhkis: but its timeout is set to 1000ms, which is a whole second...?
[07:08:12] <rapha> Aha! setTimeout is asynchronous itself :(
[07:10:06] <Uhkis> of course it is, otherwise it would be rather unusable
[07:11:27] <rapha> Uhkis: but then, how do people do what I'm trying to do here? (Load some HTML and put it into the document, wait a little, load some more, ...)
[07:12:50] <Uhkis> rapha: throw away the each loop and do everything inside the settimeouts callback
[07:14:31] <rapha> Uhkis: if I throw away the each loop, with x (i.e. an unknown number) of <a>'s, how would that work? *confused*
[07:17:28] <Uhkis> you need some kind of counter to keep track of current one, that's about it
[07:21:21] <rapha> Uhkis: yaaaay!! https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/fe3505a0cc1c91eb9becba5d6e9506a4 like this it works, thank you!
[08:19:44] <depesz> hi. how can I switch to another page from click() event (on tr element) ?
[08:20:21] <depesz> i found .load() but it loads another page as content for given element. and I just want clicking on tr behave as if it was <a>
[08:31:38] <Uhkis> depesz: $('tr').on('click', function() { window.location = 'http://google.com'; }
[08:31:47] <depesz> sweet, thanks.
[08:32:13] <depesz> is it better to use .click() or .on('click',) ?
[08:33:04] <Uhkis> i prefer on, afaik there's no difference if you're not binding to dynamic elements
[08:35:36] <depesz> thanks.
[08:36:00] <depesz> i'm dba, and never dealt with js, so this is all new to me :)

[09:13:32] <petersmith> Hello, how can I filter out array items where the value is the same as another array item
[09:16:27] <da_wunder> petersmith: $(array1).filter(array2); ?
[09:17:05] <petersmith> Sorry, it's an array of objects and I want to filter them by a property
[09:18:07] <da_wunder> petersmith: then you could use .map
[09:18:54] <petersmith> Does that allow me to remove duplicates?
[09:19:41] <da_wunder> petersmith: see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38221637/javascript-jquery-array-of-objects-intersection-by-property
[09:21:54] <damian__> hi
[09:21:59] <damian__> please, a question: is it still worth to learn jQuery ?
[09:24:26] <petersmith> Yes
[09:25:59] <petersmith> da_wunder: that just gave me an empty array
[09:26:10] <damian__> petersmith why ?
[09:26:27] <petersmith> I don't know I used the same solution offered
[09:26:38] <petersmith>  users.filter(function(user) { return types.indexOf(user.typeID) !== -1;});
[09:27:40] <damian__> I have the next 3 or 4 months to learn, and I want to choose well what I'm going to learn
[09:28:58] <petersmith> It's removed them all but I want to keep one of them
[09:29:50] <damian__> I'm not sure what exactly jquery does, apart from give some shortcus to treat some dom elements
[09:33:30] <neuromute9> Hey folks, I've got some code - https://jsfiddle.net/19jb7rv2/ - which loops data attrs on an element to create new table rows which are then appended to a table
[09:33:35] <neuromute9> this works fine in chrome and ff
[09:33:50] <neuromute9> but in ie, the order isn't adhered to
[09:33:59] <neuromute9> any ideas how I can get this to play nice in ie?
[09:42:05] <da_wunder> petersmith: working like expected https://plnkr.co/edit/MwE9WfpEkQdARlqg7vpm?p=preview
[09:48:54] <neo_> good evening :)
[09:50:11] <neo_> today had error, long time spent , forgot closed tag </script> and code disappeared in a some step
[10:29:53] <Hoder> Hey guys, what all do I need to get my click events working on mobile (using dynamically generated buttons)
[10:30:16] <Hoder> $("#controls").on("click touchstart", ".options", function() { }   I believe I'm using the correct format of the click handler
[10:54:09] <MikeD_> Hoder: you have a class of "options" ... on what element(s) ?
[10:59:54] <Hoder> Hey MikeD, I'm dynamically generating buttons with the class options
[11:00:26] <Hoder> https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/pwdYyN  Here is my codepen, I added an alert to see if it even catches me clicking, and it alerts on mobile so I'm at a loss :/
[11:00:29] <MikeD_> ok, just wanted to make sure you weren't putting an "options" class on actual <option> elements :)
[11:01:10] <Hoder> I wonder if what I'm doing "appending a selection" to the 'conversation' is too much to compute on mobile?
[11:03:57] <MikeD_> what are you at a loss about?
[11:04:48] <Kartagis> hold the deer
[11:05:42] <MikeD_> i found it a little weird to .remove() the button.options before you set the text and b_val variables, but maybe that's not important
[11:05:42] <Hoder> The click event is working, but it's not pushing the text into the conversation
[11:12:29] <MikeD_> can you even see the conversation if the newMsg is an empty string?
[11:13:19] <MikeD_> ... not sure what checking prevState.length > 3 is doing either
[11:13:48] <Kartagis> has anyone tried uploading a video to yt with javascript? what do we get back as a response? any ideas?
[11:14:13] <Woet> check the docs?
[11:14:22] <Woet> https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/insert
[11:16:07] <Kartagis> I wonder what data contains
[11:16:20] <Woet> [17:14:12]  <Woet>	check the docs?
[11:16:20] <Woet> [17:14:21]  <Woet>	https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/insert
[11:16:21] <Kartagis> hell, I'll check it tomorrow
[11:16:33] <Woet> "Response
[11:16:33] <Woet> If successful, this method returns a video resource in the response body."
[11:16:35] <Kartagis> I'm doing that Woet
[11:16:38] <Woet> https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos#resource
[11:16:43] <Woet> evidently not
[11:17:51] <Kartagis> righti I apologise
[11:21:44] <Hoder> it will push the blank text to the conversation, but won't take you to the next step MikeD
[11:22:05] <Hoder> I had a friend test and it works in chrome on android, so I'm gonna test out of safari on IOS and see
[11:22:10] <Hoder> maybe it's a safari issue?
[11:44:40] <Hoder> Is there anything that would disable me appending something in ios safari
[11:47:31] <Hoder> nevermind, I'm stupid and realized I was in private mode of safari since I didn't want anything cached. It's working now
[11:48:50] <AnGe7> Someone can explain me how to get all input & select in container ?
[11:49:01] <AnGe7> $("#container > input, select")
[11:49:03] <AnGe7> doesn't work...
[11:49:21] <taplar> $('#container').find('input, select')
[11:49:44] <AnGe7> Oh... ok. thank you taplar
[11:49:46] <taplar> or $('#container > input, #container > select')
[11:51:30] <Hoder> Is there a way to show a message if a user is in incognito?
[11:51:41] <Hoder> or how could I detect something isn't working because of it?
[11:52:31] <AnGe7> taplat, is it possible to "ignore" one block ?
[11:53:13] <AnGe7> ('#container').find('input, select') but in #container i have #actionBlock with input and select, but i dont want this field. is it possible ?
[11:54:42] <AnGe7> $('#container').not('#sendBlock').find('input, select').
[11:54:44] <AnGe7> ?
[11:55:20] <Hoder> I think you'd want to find the input/select first, then call the .not();
[11:55:43] <Hoder> $('#container').find('input, select').not('#sendBlock);
[11:56:03] <AnGe7> no i don't want find input & select inside #sendBlock
[11:57:10] <taplar> $('#container').find('input, select').filter(function(){ return $(this).closest('#actionBlock').length < 1; });
[11:58:27] <AnGe7> $('#container')..find('input, select').not('#sendBlock > input, #sendBlock > select)
[11:58:36] <AnGe7> seem its work
[12:00:54] <AnGe7> oops
[12:00:57] <AnGe7> not working
[12:01:05] <AnGe7> filter too doesn't work
[12:01:15] <taplar> ?
[12:01:51] <AnGe7> https://pastebin.com/1NUpjakh
[12:02:12] <AnGe7> event fired on input field inside #sendBlock
[12:02:29] <taplar> confirm that #sendBlock is a child of #container
[12:02:31] <AnGe7> erf...
[12:02:36] <AnGe7> #sendBlock yes
[12:02:39] <AnGe7> not #actionBlock...
[12:02:40] <taplar> or that selector is #actionBlock
[12:02:41] <AnGe7> -_-'
[12:03:18] <AnGe7> it's work with the right name...
[12:03:21] <AnGe7> thank you taplar !
[12:08:15] <taplar> small note, the anonymous function on the change event isn't necessary

[13:46:44] <rjCousineau> Hello, i'm trying to generate dom elements. I have $tr = $('<tr>'); $tr.each(obj, function(key,value){ }); but i'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: b.call is not a function - in jquery.min.js:2
[13:47:03] <rjCousineau> if I have $('<tr>') i can't seem to look over it
[13:47:18] <taplar> why loop?
[13:47:38] <taplar> it's a single element
[13:48:07] <rjCousineau> I'm building nested dom elements by appending.  I have an append(function(){...}) where I want to append create and return multipe <tr> dom elements
[13:48:31] <taplar> you still wouldn't loop over that single tr
[13:48:36] <taplar> you'd just append to it
[13:48:39] <rjCousineau> so. foreach array(1,2,3) create 3 <tr> elemtns
[13:49:04] <taplar> none of that changes my statement man
[13:49:21] <rjCousineau> I want to $(this).append( html )
[13:49:33] <taplar> $tr.append( html )
[13:49:34] <rjCousineau> $(this) being multiple $('<tr>')
[13:49:40] <rjCousineau> eh
[13:49:42] <taplar> ok, so your example was incomplete
[13:49:50] <taplar> please show a more complete example of the issue
[13:49:53] <rjCousineau> ok
[13:50:23] <rjCousineau> https://dpaste.de/Baaw line 10
[13:50:39] <taplar> yeah, no
[13:50:53] <taplar> 10 is not an each
[13:50:59] <taplar> what is the array?
[13:51:16] <rjCousineau> categories
[13:51:23] <taplar> that's not an array
[13:51:26] <taplar> that's an object
[13:51:36] <rjCousineau> hmm
[13:51:39] <taplar> [ 'Design', 'Other' ]
[13:51:41] <taplar> is an array
[13:51:43] <taplar> in which case
[13:51:59] <taplar> $.each([ 'Design', 'Other'] , function (... ) ... );
[13:52:18] <taplar> or
[13:52:23] <taplar> ['Design', 'Other'].forEach()
[13:53:22] <rjCousineau> ok, that makes sense
[13:58:03] <rjCousineau> Ok, so i'm iterating properly, but i'm unclear how I can return a jquery object of stacked dom elements.  $() = <tr/><tr/><tr/>;  https://dpaste.de/nUEX#L5,34
[13:58:29] <rjCousineau> I don't think it's legal but I want to express what i'm trying to achieve
[14:01:05] <rjCousineau> is there a way to create an empty jquery object?
[14:01:05] <taplar> need to look at the api for $.each.  One of those parameters is the index
[14:01:11] <taplar> $()
[14:01:21] <rjCousineau> I just saw that
[14:01:56] <rjCousineau> so if I start with $obj = $(); then .appendTo($obj) I should end up with a jquery object
[14:02:12] <rjCousineau> *end up with a jquery object full of elements
[14:02:23] <taplar> not sure, in that case
[14:02:30] <taplar> cause there technically isn't anything to append to
[14:02:53] <taplar> one sec
[14:05:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rv2ndqqz/
[14:05:10] <taplar> very basic, but a base line
[14:06:11] <rjCousineau> thats really interesting
[14:14:23] <rjCousineau> taplar: I'm able to console.log() the $obj thats built inside $.each(), except $obj.html() won't append https://jsfiddle.net/rv2ndqqz/1/
[14:14:53] <taplar> lol, so lets just ignore the sample i gave?
[14:16:48] <rjCousineau> Not at all, I tried to manipulate it but it drove me to try this too
[14:17:31] <taplar> you should try to use the $.map version as it will result in only a single append to the dom, which is more performant
[14:18:47] <rjCousineau> Your example works, sorry. https://jsfiddle.net/rv2ndqqz/2/
[14:19:21] <taplar> yup
[14:19:23] <rjCousineau> thanks for your help, i wasn't ignoring your example.
[14:19:42] <rjCousineau> awesome, ty!
[14:19:45] <Uhkis> now use array.map() instead of $.map!
[14:19:55] <taplar> ^ sure
[14:27:00] <rjCousineau> map is sweet
[14:44:27] <taplar> it's your go to translator
[14:51:16] <tables> how can i let jquery read my input from my input form and change the input string so that it is all lower case?
[14:51:21] <tables> http://localhost/weather2.php?city=diamond+bar
[14:51:26] <tables> from
[14:51:36] <tables> http://localhost/weather2.php?city=Diamond+Bar
[14:52:00] <taplar> what input is that in?
[14:52:05] <taplar> can you show an example?
[14:52:13] <Uhkis> string.toLowerCase()
[14:54:41] <tables> http://localhost/weather2.php?city=Diamond+Bar%2C+California%2C+United+States+%285342992%29
[14:54:47] <tables> how do i get only the last few numbers there
[14:54:59] <tables> 5342992
[14:54:59] <taplar> from where?
[14:55:03] <tables> that kinda input
[14:55:12] <tables> er oops
[14:55:13] <tables> wrong question
[14:55:15] <tables> i have a new question
[14:55:28] <tables> how can i get everything before the first comma?
[14:55:34] <tables> %2C
[14:55:39] <taplar> from where?
[14:55:40] <tables> just Diamond+Bar is what i want
[14:55:45] <tables> from that kinda input
[14:55:50] <tables> http://localhost/weather2.php?city=Diamond+Bar%2C+California%2C+United+States+%285342992%29
[14:55:54] <taplar> be more specific
[14:55:57] <taplar> an <input> ?
[14:56:05] <tables> fom the input i only want to get everything before %2C or comma
[14:56:12] <taplar> dude, lol
[14:56:19] <tables> <form action="/weather2.php">
[14:56:20] <tables> <input id="countries" placeholder="Enter your city" name="city"/>
[14:56:20] <tables> <input type="submit">
[14:56:26] <tables> using jquery or javascript
[14:58:19] <Uhkis> cant use jquery without javascript :P
[14:58:51] <Uhkis> other way works though
[15:01:07] <taplar> i swear there was a way to grab just the params off of a link, but i'm forgetting it
[15:01:14] <taplar> probably more of a ##javascript question
[15:08:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a318s34d/   huh, never used URL before I don't think
[15:14:08] <tables> after you get city
[15:14:30] <tables> how do you parse it so it gets everything before the comma?
[15:14:33] <tables> or %2C
[15:14:57] <taplar> ask in ##javascript
[15:18:26] <taplar> otherwise, I may have been looking at this weird.  i missed that this was a form submit and not just a string.  so are you really asking how to lower case the countries before the form submits?
[15:19:19] <taplar> if that is the case, bind on the submit of the form, cancel the event.  find the countries and lower case it.  then finally perform a submit() on the raw form DOM element, not the jquery object of the form
[15:44:07] <Scoop7> http://jsfiddle.net/pmGRq/97/  does anyone know why this doesn't work? :/
[15:44:14] <Scoop7> or I need to set a trigger event ?
[15:44:43] <taplar> where's the jquery?
[15:45:13] <Scoop7> fixed a bit : http://jsfiddle.net/pmGRq/98/
[15:47:13] <Scoop7> taplar: https://jquery.com/
[15:47:41] <taplar> not what i was asking.  other than the doc ready, all this logic is ##javascript
[15:48:07] <Scoop7> oh right so doc ready is jquery
[15:49:12] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/pmGRq/99/
[15:51:19] <Scoop7> taplar does the height is the same for you, because for some reason I don't really seem the difference in the output
[15:51:25] <Scoop7> ?
[15:51:33] <taplar> there's nothing outputed
[15:51:44] <taplar> height is not set inline on the elements
[15:52:04] <taplar> Element.style === <tag style="this">
[15:53:30] <Scoop7> so how to fix the issue?
[15:54:19] <taplar> you gotta figure out how to find the actual height of the element, either with javascript or jquery
[15:55:29] <Scoop7> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/3vvhwzgh/1/
[15:56:20] <taplar> ?
[15:59:17] <plamb__> for some reason when I run this code the window.location.hash executes, but the console.log does not. Is this because the console is reloaded when window.location.hash is called?
[15:59:18] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kn810f63/
[16:10:20] <Woet> plamb__: if you use jsfiddle, can you please make sure it actually demonstrates the issue?
[16:10:27] <Woet> plamb__: instead of running it with a syntax error and without loading jquery
[16:10:55] <taplar> Woet: i'm not sure that jsfiddle lets you change the window hash
[16:11:19] <Woet> taplar: thats not relevant to demonstrating the issue though
[16:11:27] <taplar> how so?
[16:11:29] <Woet> taplar: and sure, its just an iframe
[16:11:36] <Woet> taplar: because his issue is that console.log doesn't execute
[16:12:45] <taplar> huh, could have sworn that was one of the things they restricted
[16:12:49] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:55:24] <Dancia>  I want access data from website: https://jsonvat.com/ Why I can GET json response in POSTMAN, but fail with crossorigin error in jsfiddle https://jsbin.com/luroyuluxi/2/edit?html,js,output ?
[16:56:00] <taplar> what is postman?
[16:57:49] <Dancia> chrome http requests app
[16:58:00] <taplar> then that is why
[16:58:17] <taplar> javascript is restricted by cross origin request
[16:58:23] <Dancia> or i can GET it in https://www.hurl.it/ by typing in https://jsonvat.com/
[16:58:29] <Dancia> why don't i get cross origin in this case
[16:58:44] <Dancia> I don't quite understand, whats so different from my request
[16:59:00] <Dancia> IMHO they both should be cross-origin, no?
[16:59:05] <taplar> if the request is made by the browser, such as if you type it in the url, then it's not cross origin
[16:59:16] <taplar> browser apps are most likely of the same type
[16:59:22] <taplar> where as javascript is not
[16:59:50] <Dancia> oh, so my only option is just copy-paste data?
[16:59:58] <taplar> ?
[17:00:10] <Dancia> I mean this
[17:00:10] <Dancia> https://jsonvat.com/
[17:00:24] <Dancia> json stuff, I can only copy it, I can't access it via js in any means?
[17:00:34] <Dancia> load it dynamically i mean
[17:00:37] <taplar> you can possibly get it with a jsonp call
[17:01:13] <taplar> https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/
[17:13:01] <Dancia> Doesn't seem like it works. https://jsbin.com/leduguwope/1/edit?html,js,output throws errors for no reason
[17:13:35] <duch_kazatel> https://jsonvat.com/?callback=foo
[17:13:38] <duch_kazatel> doesn't support jsonp
[17:14:18] <taplar> sites can block jsonp?
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:14:43] <taplar> or am i confuzzed
[17:14:43] <robertmaxrees> it's not about blocking, you just simply don't support it.
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> jsonp requires that they take a querystring param (usually "Callback") and then they call that function, passing in the json object.
[17:15:32] <robertmaxrees> so you call whatever.com/json?callback=foo
[17:15:57] <robertmaxrees> they return foo({"someParam": "someValue", "lol": "wut"});
[17:16:01] <taplar> really, huh.  for some reason i thought jsonp was like sticking the request in a <script src=""> on the page and then grabbing the result from it
[17:16:07] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[17:16:11] <taplar> bah!
[17:16:15] <robertmaxrees> short for "json with padding"
[17:16:51] <Dancia> heh, then I'll just retrieve this json from back-end then, some extra delay and requests, but whatever.
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> Dancia shouldn't be that much more.
[17:17:49] <robertmaxrees> Dancia are you concerned about the overhead of a 3rd party call in your backend?
[17:20:03] <Dancia> Well, I have to do 3rd party call anyway in back-end to verify added taxes, so it's ok.
[17:20:18] <Dancia> I hate taxes. :D
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> heh our tax service adds some pretty batty overhead.
[17:20:44] <robertmaxrees> one option is to expose an endpoint on your server that acts as a proxy just for this call.
[17:21:00] <robertmaxrees> and then hit that proxy with ajax.
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't have to hold up pageload time with that call.
[17:23:10] <Dancia> That makes sense, thanks.
[22:57:16] <lemonsparrow> is there a plugin/library that supports tree view and add/remove nodes from both left and right.. like a binary tree than just one side ?
[23:02:04] <sonnie> hi there, i have been struggling on jwplayer for hours... Have to call help now. Please tell me why IE8 throws a 'jwplayer is not defined' error?  URL: http://lib.ustc.edu.cn/freshmen/t.html
