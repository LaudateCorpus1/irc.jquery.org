[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> :) lots of options out there.
[14:08:32] <jak2000> ok, of course i googled the topic, but sometimes, anyone know a lib...
[14:08:36] <jak2000> thanks
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> lol

[17:27:49] <MACscr> So im using flot to chart some data that im pulling from a mysql database. I have a datepicker tied to it that allows the user to select what date range they want to chart. My problem is that the longer the data range, the data to plot, thus the chart looks a bit too busy and smooshed. Im guessing i should simply plot less points as the data range gets larger or something like that. Im looking for suggestions. https://codepen.io/MACscr

[17:28:05] <MACscr> crap, broke the link https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/bZOmPY
[17:29:54] <taplar> you could experiment with angling the dates
[17:33:30] <MACscr> taplar yes, that could help to an extent, but still going to have issues when users want to see a years worth of data, etc. I have to somehow figure out a proper way to summarize or something. idk
[17:33:47] <taplar> or limit the range
[17:34:43] <MACscr> thats what i had been doing, but its been requested to increase that. Some even want an "all time" option, but i somehow have to limit that as some users have millions of records a month.
[17:35:28] <taplar> how easy is it to contact your users that requested that?
[17:37:09] <MACscr> easy, but why do you ask?
[17:37:40] <taplar> it might be worth while to make an example of what "all time" looks at, and stick it in front of their faces, and simply say, "this is what you are asking for"
[17:37:56] <taplar> so they realize how ugly it would look
[17:38:15] <taplar> otherwise, hmmm
[17:38:25] <MACscr> yes, but its our job to not make it look ugly.... =P
[17:38:44] <taplar> right, be we also can't always accomidate the user
[17:38:59] <MACscr> no, i completely get that too
[17:39:13] <taplar> the only other thing that came to mind might be a sliding graph of some sort
[17:39:55] <MACscr> well im figuring maybe you start plotting weekly totals instead and then monthly, etc?
[17:39:56] <taplar> like, the left key is fixed, but let the graph grow horizontally unbounded, but give it an overflow of some width
[17:40:03] <taplar> and then they could possibly drag it left and right
[17:40:19] <MACscr> yes, ive seen those fancy ones that let you zoom in, etc, and out
[17:40:23] <taplar> or yeah, larger plot points if they are ok with that
[17:40:24] <MACscr> they are pretty slick
[17:41:29] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/api/post/library/pure/
[17:41:35] <MACscr> i guess something like this would work
[17:42:35] <taplar> i got a 404
[17:42:40] <MACscr> hmm, now to find something similar that is a bit more open
[17:43:35] <MACscr> yep, google charts can do it too. nice
[17:43:46] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/5h7jxqq8/2/
[17:44:15] <taplar> nice
[17:44:57] <taplar> https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/   lol, or these days take whatever you want and stick 'js' on the end of it
[17:45:45] <taplar> i want to see some demos though.... hmmm
[17:46:50] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/MACscr/5zuy1wjo/
[17:46:57] <MACscr> does drag to zoom. i like that
[17:47:25] <taplar> right click to zoom out, really nice
[17:47:38] <taplar> just needs some verbage to tell the users how that works
[18:01:57] <MACscr> i guess flot even has some support for this, but its ux isnt as good for that
[18:02:09] <MACscr> sucks because i like the look ive achieved with flot
[18:59:19] <taplar> have a good weekend MACscr
