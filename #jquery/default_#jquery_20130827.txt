[00:00:13] <Tomashe\> ok done
[00:00:36] <doug65536> Tomashe\: are you sure the ajax callback even gets called?
[00:00:37] <Tomashe\>  itemids.push($(this).attr("itemid"));
[00:00:42] <Tomashe\> yes
[00:00:44] <Tomashe\> it is!
[00:00:51] <Tomashe\> cuz u can see the info online
[00:00:51] <Tomashe\> :)
[00:01:05] <Tomashe\> and i have console.log there to confirm it
[00:01:14] <doug65536> Tomashe\: $ is the same thing as jQuery
[00:01:25] <doug65536> $.parseJSON...
[00:01:40] <Tomashe\> ok but this isnt the problem
[00:02:12] <doug65536> hide() and show() are easier to use than .css("display", "none") and .css("display", "block")
[00:02:34] <doug65536> Tomashe\: without running it I would say it looks fine
[00:02:47] <doug65536> Tomashe\: bug must be something else, like .more-loader being wrong
[00:03:09] <Tomashe\> look
[00:03:16] <Tomashe\> u can see it online on www.lasso.co.il
[00:03:23] <Tomashe\> just wait untill it loads and then scroll down
[00:05:15] <doug65536> Tomashe\: ok, so what is the problem exactly?
[00:05:17] <doug65536> it loads stuff
[00:05:48] <Tomashe\> yes but the boxs or overlap eahc other
[00:06:08] <Tomashe\> it isnt loading the images before it loads the wookmark , so the size and the positions are wrong
[00:06:27] <Tomashe\> it should loads the photos before it loads the wookmark , then everything will be fine
[00:06:28] <doug65536> Tomashe\: really? where, I don't see any overlaps
[00:07:05] <doug65536> Tomashe\: I did earlier but now it isn't. I'll force reload...
[00:07:19] <doug65536> ok now it is
[00:08:01] <Tomashe\> yes like , sometimes doing it and sometimes not
[00:08:15] <Tomashe\> anyway the issue is the wookmark loads before images im sure of that
[00:08:16] <doug65536> Tomashe\: there is a way to make wookmark refresh
[00:08:23] <Tomashe\> how?
[00:08:28] <Tomashe\> i tried everything
[00:09:11] <Tomashe\> $('#resultLand').trigger('refreshWookmark')
[00:09:19] <Tomashe\> if u mean that , its not working look i enabled it
[00:11:22] <doug65536> Tomashe\: odd, because if I dump the parents from a random image with this: $('img[src*="86-"]').parents().each(function() { console.log($(this).attr('id'), $.data(this)); })
[00:11:36] <doug65536> then I notice that wookmark has set data on the parent of #resultLand
[00:12:27] <doug65536> Tomashe\: when are you triggering that?
[00:12:54] <IvelfanFr> Hello everybody
[00:13:00] <Tomashe\> at the end of the .done on the ajax call
[00:13:09] <doug65536> Tomashe\: right, too early
[00:13:21] <doug65536> Tomashe\: you need to do it after every image loads, right?
[00:13:34] <doug65536> let me try something...
[00:14:01] <Tomashe\> refresh the website and check
[00:14:34] <doug65536> Tomashe\: yep, I have a fix...
[00:15:18] <Tomashe\> i will love to hear that
[00:16:41] <futile> Hi.
[00:16:44] <doug65536> Tomashe\: well, I have one way that may work, I see you have the imagesLoaded plugin already. if you put $('#resultLand').imagesLoaded(function() { $('#resultLand').trigger('wookmarkRefresh'); });   that might work
[00:17:18] <IvelfanFr> I have a trouble with jQuery Mobile, I wanna do a SlideToggle Menu. I do this : http://pastebin.com/GichyQy6 on the bottom of my page. He works on the first page but not a another page when I click on slide menu-item
[00:17:27] <doug65536> Tomashe\: I say might work because I haven't used imagesLoaded plugin before
[00:17:29] <Tomashe\> let me try
[00:17:51] <Tomashe\> ok let me check now
[00:17:59] <doug65536> Tomashe\: triggering wookmarkRefresh definitely fixes the problem though, I ran it in the console and it fixed all overlaps
[00:18:19] <doug65536> Tomashe\: you just have to get it to happen at the correct time
[00:18:55] <Tomashe\> hmm
[00:19:07] <Tomashe\> do u see it overlap now?
[00:19:11] <Tomashe\> im not sure if that worked
[00:19:24] <doug65536> it worked
[00:19:41] <doug65536> it was all overlapped to hell, and once images were done it fixed it
[00:20:06] <Tomashe\> yeah looks likes workign ow
[00:20:15] <Tomashe\> will be great to add some fadeIn effect
[00:20:22] <Tomashe\> do u have any suggestion?
[00:20:36] <doug65536> Tomashe\: yes, all those images are WAY to high resolution
[00:21:00] <doug65536> Tomashe\: you are going to run up your ISP bandwidth usage and it takes way too long to load all those wastefully large images
[00:21:21] <doug65536> Tomashe\: and it makes them look awful when they scale
[00:22:06] <doug65536> Tomashe\: mouse over this one וילה עם בריכה at bottom right and look at the flickery moire pattern on roof
[00:22:38] <Tomashe\> yes , there are some images are for testing
[00:22:42] <Tomashe\> it will be changed
[00:22:54] <Tomashe\> so what do u say about the fadeIn effect?
[00:22:57] <doug65536> ideally make the resolution as close to displayed size as possible
[00:23:47] <doug65536> Tomashe\: easy, make all of the images initially display: none, then in imagesLoaded, do $('#resultLand img').fadeIn()
[00:24:31] <Tomashe\> hmm
[00:24:41] <Tomashe\> this is what i was trying but ok let me check
[00:25:58] <doug65536> IvelfanFr: my 1st guess is other page doesn't have an element with id="menu_top"
[00:26:35] <Tomashe\> but look now
[00:27:14] <doug65536> Tomashe\: script crashes...
[00:27:14] <Tomashe\> resultLand.each("div.result-item",function(){				$(this).attr("style","display:none");			});
[00:27:17] <Tomashe\> yes
[00:27:19] <Tomashe\> cuz of that
[00:27:37] <doug65536> Tomashe\: lol, don't do it like that. use .css
[00:28:01] <Tomashe\> so inside that loop i should add this element css class with display none
[00:28:03] <Tomashe\> will that work?
[00:28:10] <doug65536> $('#resultLand img').hide()
[00:28:19] <Tomashe\> i dont want it to hide the ims only
[00:28:34] <doug65536> $('#resultLand .result-item').hide()
[00:28:34] <Tomashe\> i want it to hide the entire box and make it fade in
[00:28:47] <doug65536> why do it the hard way
[00:29:22] <Tomashe\> cuz this way its not working u can check yourself
[00:29:26] <doug65536> '#resultLand .result-item' <-- selects all things with class result-item that are a descendant of #resultLand
[00:29:42] <futile> this is a good read http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/06/the-broken-window-theory.html
[00:30:14] <doug65536> Tomashe\: works for me
[00:30:24] <doug65536> Tomashe\: run this in console: $('#resultLand .result-item')
[00:30:51] <Tomashe\> hehe i want to hide ONLY the new itmes that added
[00:31:25] <doug65536> ok, at first there is nothing, and some code adds them all right?
[00:31:43] <Tomashe\> no
[00:31:45] <doug65536> then you scroll and it adds more, right?
[00:32:00] <Tomashe\> using php it shows the first items
[00:32:07] <Tomashe\> and when u scroll it start to add more and more..
[00:32:19] <doug65536> ok, no problem...
[00:32:44] <doug65536> Tomashe\: 1 sec
[00:33:14] <doug65536> Tomashe\: where's the code that adds more?
[00:33:42] <Tomashe\> the code i pasted u
[00:34:04] <doug65536> can you post it again? I can't find it in scrollback
[00:34:58] <Tomashe\> http://jsfiddle.net/jxA6j/2/
[00:35:42] <doug65536> abailarri: .hide() is a simple way to display: none
[00:36:26] <sarahm> hello, im tryin to implement some sort of long polling , this code : http://bpaste.net/show/Gf7t8da17Njg3aSFwIjQ/ , gives me : too much recursion , but i dont know how to do it otherwise
[00:37:16] <doug65536> sarahm: there is no recursion
[00:37:39] <doug65536> sarahm: that complete handler is called long after $.ajax returns
[00:37:52] <sarahm> doug65536: it's the error i get in firebug
[00:38:18] <doug65536> sarahm: hmm, I wouldn't have thought that's possible. you are attempting to retry?
[00:38:52] <doug65536> sarahm: it's an infinite loop in any case
[00:39:03] <doug65536> sarahm: when does it give up?
[00:39:32] <doug65536> sarahm: complete is called *every* time, whether it succeeds or fails
[00:39:52] <abailarri> doug65536: what is the sintaxis?
[00:40:13] <doug65536> abailarri: oh I see the bug
[00:40:29] <doug65536> abailarri: you are *calling* request in the complete handler
[00:40:58] <sarahm> doug65536: normally i think it doesnt even call the ajax function since neither the success or error function are executed, i just have my loading image and then "too much recursion 	  $.ajax({" in the firebug console
[00:41:28] <doug65536> sarahm: yes what you are doing makes no sense, you are CALLING request and assigning its return value to complete:
[00:41:40] <doug65536> http://bpaste.net/show/n0l8YYm3eCmlikKSkiRc/
[00:42:06] <Tomashe\> hmm
[00:42:16] <doug65536> sarahm: my paste fixes that issue, but it still is going to do ajax calls as fast as it can forever
[00:42:20] <doug65536> sarahm: why?
[00:42:44] <abailarri> doug65536: what do you refer?
[00:42:59] <doug65536> abailarri: why is it repeating the request?
[00:43:00] <sarahm> doug65536: i was tryin to follow this tutorial http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery , well i'm fetching live data from a server i want the data updated constantly
[00:43:24] <sarahm> doug65536: i think you mean to speak to me and instead you're speaking to abailarri :)
[00:43:38] <abailarri> jajaja
[00:44:07] <Tomashe\> doug65536: did u check my thing?
[00:44:08] <doug65536> sarahm: that tutorial is ridiculous. it does nonstop ajax calls as fast as it can. it's awful
[00:44:50] <doug65536> Tomashe\: yes 1 sec
[00:45:00] <doug65536> sarahm: use setTimeout
[00:45:37] <Tomashe\> k
[00:45:42] <sarahm> doug65536: :/ my bad the problem with setTimeout if for example i set it to 30000 but my data takes 50000 to update then i won't see it til the next call right?
[00:46:09] <doug65536> Tomashe\: see line 32 http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/jxA6j/3/
[00:46:30] <doug65536> Tomashe\: ah... 1 sec
[00:46:55] <Tomashe\> but this will HIDE all my items no? not just those i just loaded
[00:47:06] <doug65536> Tomashe\: yes, realized that. fixing
[00:49:09] <doug65536> Tomashe\: see lines 22 thru 24, 36, 37, 48 http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/jxA6j/4/
[00:50:44] <Tomashe\> look now please
[00:50:51] <Tomashe\> as u can see the fadeIn isnt working :/
[00:53:09] <doug65536> resultLand.find('.result-item') returns nothing
[00:53:18] <Tomashe\> even if i remove the fadeIn ... it still shows them
[00:53:43] <doug65536> resultLand is already the list of .result-item
[00:53:55] <Tomashe\> what?!
[00:53:58] <Tomashe\> i dont get it
[00:53:59] <doug65536> resultLand.find... again makes it look for children
[00:54:08] <doug65536> 			var resultLand = html.find(".result-item");
[00:54:09] <doug65536> 			resultLand.find('.result-item').hide()
[00:54:20] <doug65536> just do resultLand.hide()
[00:54:42] <doug65536> find looks for children
[00:54:46] <doug65536> it ignores itself
[00:55:56] <doug65536> Tomashe\: do you follow?
[00:56:07] <Tomashe\> yes i did change it
[00:56:10] <Tomashe\> but it still
[00:56:11] <Tomashe\> :/
[00:56:41] <Tomashe\> the fadeIn isnt working :/
[00:56:59] <TomiK> hey... I'm having a problem with .on with jquery 1.10.2
[00:57:06] <doug65536> you didn't update it with what I posted you
[00:57:14] <Tomashe\> http://jsfiddle.net/jxA6j/6/
[00:57:16] <Tomashe\> kiij
[00:57:21] <Tomashe\> loook at that
[00:58:14] <doug65536> that is not what is on site
[00:58:21] <Tomashe\> ok updated
[00:58:24] <doug65536> refresh lag?
[00:58:37] <Tomashe\> still u can check
[00:58:44] <Tomashe\> it show everything in 1 time
[00:58:45] <Tomashe\> boom
[00:58:52] <Tomashe\> no 5000 fadeIn
[00:59:19] <TomiK> here http://pastebin.com/6QnLW591
[00:59:58] <TomiK> the href used to be "#" but changed it to javascript:; for testing...
[01:00:08] <doug65536> Tomashe\: wookmark is showing everything
[01:00:28] <TomiK> if I change it to # the browser always goes to #
[01:01:00] <Tomashe\> resultLand.hide();
[01:01:00] <Tomashe\> 			console.log(resultLand);
[01:01:06] <TomiK> I used to use live(), but it isn't supported anymore
[01:01:09] <doug65536> put that inside images loaded and put newItems.hide() after that too
[01:01:11] <Tomashe\> i put that and as much as i see those are not HIDDEN
[01:01:14] <Tomashe\> it doesnt apply the hime on them
[01:01:30] <doug65536> Tomashe\: settle down please
[01:01:37] <doug65536> Tomashe\: you mad?
[01:01:38] <TomiK> anyone?
[01:02:14] <Tomashe\> hehehehe
[01:02:16] <Tomashe\> why mad?
[01:02:17] <doug65536> Tomashe\: wookmark shows everything
[01:02:23] <Tomashe\> hmm
[01:02:33] <doug65536> I verified that the hide works
[01:02:34] <Tomashe\> maybe there is a wookmark property to fadeIn .. let me check :)
[01:02:39] <doug65536> then wookmark goes and wipes it out
[01:03:11] <doug65536> TomiK: .on works like live
[01:03:22] <TomiK> doug65536: yes, I know it should
[01:03:31] <doug65536> TomiK: I assure you, it does
[01:03:34] <TomiK> doug65536: but it doesn't seem to work at all :D
[01:03:53] <TomiK> check my code, it's exactly like "live", but "on"
[01:04:04] <doug65536> TomiK: use event.target instead of this
[01:04:37] <TomiK> doug65536: I can comment that hide out and it still won't work
[01:05:10] <doug65536> TomiK: you tried event.target already?
[01:05:40] <TomiK> doug65536: that isn't my problem... the problem is jquery won't get a hang on the dynamically created link
[01:05:51] <TomiK> doug65536: preventDefault won't work at all
[01:06:03] <doug65536> TomiK: try what I suggested or don't bother me
[01:06:56] <doug65536> TomiK: if $(event.target) doesn't fix it, you must be trying to attach the handlers before the objects exist
[01:07:35] <TomiK> doug65536: isn't that pretty much the idea of "on" ? To link code to items that do not exist yet?
[01:07:58] <doug65536> TomiK: no. if that's what you wanted, then do this...
[01:08:31] <doug65536> $(document).on('click', 'a.remove_selected_product_category', function(event) ...
[01:09:03] <doug65536> TomiK: and replace $(this) with $(event.target) in the handler
[01:09:19] <TomiK> doug65536: ahhh... I only have $(function() {
[01:09:48] <doug65536> TomiK: that runs the function on document ready
[01:09:52] <TomiK> doug65536: the first line of the .js -file ^
[01:09:59] <doug65536> TomiK: yes, keep that
[01:10:17] <doug65536> TomiK: everything inside that function runs immediately, or when the document is ready
[01:10:22] <TomiK> exactly
[01:10:43] <TomiK> this is how it's always worked before... so wondering why not now :D
[01:11:05] <doug65536> TomiK: what I was getting at was, if you do $(...selector...).on(...   then selector must already exist
[01:11:34] <doug65536> TomiK: but if you want old-style live() behavior, do $(document).on('click', ...selector..., function(event) { ...$(event.target)... })
[01:12:20] <doug65536> TomiK: the first way works, when the children of ...selector... don't exist yet, but that object must exist
[01:12:22] <TomiK> doug65536: complicated compared to "live"
[01:12:36] <Tomashe\> doug65536: i did it in some other way
[01:12:37] <doug65536> TomiK: sorry, live sucked, they had to fix it
[01:12:39] <Tomashe\> looks like its working :)
[01:12:43] <Tomashe\> thanks for ALL the help man!
[01:12:49] <doug65536> Tomashe\: np :)
[01:13:16] <doug65536> TomiK: but they fixed it in a way that let you continue to do what you were doing, just different
[01:13:47] <doug65536> TomiK: do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:13:50] <TomiK> doug65536: I see... I'll look into it
[01:16:46] <TomiK> doug65536: yes, it works. Thanks!
[01:16:46] <doug65536> TomiK: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/mBnzr/2/
[01:16:51] <doug65536> TomiK: np
[01:24:04] <sarahm> doug65536: hi again , your fix worked but as u said it keeps sending ajax requests infinitely which is good since i'll have the updates live, but it's a bit of a waste, do you know how to send the request only when the data changes?
[01:24:51] <doug65536> sarahm: your server knows when the data changes?
[01:25:43] <doug65536> sarahm: sure, repeating the request is fine. doing requests over and over as fast as you can is not fine
[01:26:22] <doug65536> sarahm: wouldn't a few second delay, at least a few seconds, be good enough?
[01:26:43] <Cork> websockets?
[01:26:47] <doug65536> sarahm: what kind of data requires updating as fast as you can
[01:27:00] <Cork> server events?
[01:27:20] <Cork> longpull?
[01:27:21] <doug65536> yes, I was going to suggest websockets, but then the server side would need to know when data is updated
[01:29:09] <doug65536> sarahm: ah, I see what that tutorial was saying...
[01:29:10] <Cork> doug65536: and constantly starting a connection might not cost much, it depends on how the server handles it
[01:29:22] <seutje> if it's php, it'll melt
[01:29:34] <doug65536> sarahm: it was saying that the server doesn't send a response - it sits there until it has an update
[01:29:37] <Cork> not necessary
[01:29:49] <seutje> it did last time I tried comet-y stuff q.q
[01:29:59] <Cork> what server?
[01:30:03] <Cork> and how was php running?
[01:30:10] <seutje> very carefully :P
[01:30:13] <Cork> :)
[01:30:34] <Cork> i meant if php is running in a constant process
[01:30:39] <seutje> was quite a while ago, I just remember hoping the app didn't gain too much popularity
[01:30:45] <Cork> and the server doesn't spawn new processes all the time
[01:30:45] <seutje> was a shared host
[01:30:48] <Cork> comet isn't a problem
[01:31:08] <doug65536> reminds me of NPH perl scripts years ago :)
[01:31:25] <seutje> probably helped that the app sucked, gaining no popularity at all :P
[01:31:27] <sarahm> doug65536:  electronic devices data
[01:31:38] <Cork> also i don't think php does websocket
[01:31:48] <sarahm> doug65536: well i think i will not be doing lazypoll i will just send a request every 5sec or so
[01:31:48] <doug65536> sarahm: ok, I was under the impression that it was sending a response immediately...
[01:32:16] <seutje> yeah, doubt it
[01:32:16] <doug65536> sarahm: if there is no response or there is a long delay between "events" (responses), you original code is fine (with my fix to the complete handler)
[01:32:37] <sarahm> doug65536: yep it is fine i have a response
[01:33:06] <sarahm> doug65536: but i think i shouldnt be resending a request immediately, just send another one after 5sec or so
[01:33:29] <sarahm> doug65536: i should do that with settimeout right?
[01:33:47] <sarahm> doug65536: sorry i've never done any js before thats why im askin kinda dumb questions
[01:33:57] <Cork> sarahm: make sure you run setTimeout from the always callback though
[01:34:11] <Cork> else you can end up in a nasty situation
[01:35:01] <sarahm> Cork: you mean instead of complete have always : then setTimeout ?
[01:35:24] <Cork> sarahm: complete == always
[01:35:36] <Cork> sarahm: just as success == done
[01:35:48] <doug65536> sarahm: if you want a delay before starting the next request, use complete: function() { setTimeout(function() { request(url, xpath, id); }, 2000); }
[01:36:12] <sarahm> Cork: oh ok
[01:36:17] <doug65536> sarahm: 2 second delay
[01:36:28] <sarahm> doug65536: ok thanks , i think its better than resending a request automatically
[01:36:47] <doug65536> sarahm: yes, particularly in the error case
[01:37:04] <doug65536> sarahm: if server gets overloaded, everyone will start doing a DOS attack
[01:37:19] <doug65536> sarahm: without the setTimeout
[01:37:30] <Cork> you might also want to have tow separate handlers
[01:37:31] <Nebros> hi all. i have to have a look on a code of my friend. http://dpaste.com/1357809/ in this part, i get a warning: inefficient jquery usage. how can i correct this?
[01:37:37] <Cork> one for error and one for success
[01:37:45] <Cork> and have the client back off on errors
[01:38:01] <Cork> like success: 1sec, error: 30 sec
[01:38:24] <sarahm> doug65536: and also, i could also use setInterval right?
[01:38:29] <sarahm> Cork: yes i think it's best
[01:38:36] <Cork> no NEVER use setInterval!
[01:38:41] <doug65536> sarahm: no, I wouldn't use setInterval
[01:38:54] <sarahm> ok i won't :D but why?
[01:39:08] <Cork> sarahm: setInterval runs in a steady stream, not caring how long each execution takes
[01:39:10] <doug65536> sarahm: because it will start to "pile up" ajax requests
[01:39:18] <sarahm> and also, i'm sending about 16 requests at once, won't that be a problem somehow ?
[01:39:26] <Cork> sarahm: so if your unlucky you can end up with the client opening 10+ connections at the same time
[01:39:29] <doug65536> sarahm: if server gets slow, it will start overlapping requests, and become a DOS attack
[01:39:35] <sarahm> right i see !
[01:40:18] <Cork> actually setinterval is normally a bad idea, in all cases
[01:40:34] <sarahm> Cork:  ok noted, never use that one
[01:40:35] <Cork> it's safer to use setTimeout and chain them
[01:41:56] <doug65536> Cork: about that mozilla bug: the guy says "works for me" and that it's fine on his computer in win7 in firefox
[01:42:04] <doug65536> Cork: I have trouble believing him
[01:42:17] <doug65536> Cork: the jerky animation thing
[01:42:27] <Cork> doug65536: link?
[01:42:45] <Cork> (it's most likely not responses from a developer)
[01:42:59] <doug65536> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=909166
[01:43:59] <Cork> doug65536: ya, that's just a tester; though it just means you need to specify the criteria better
[01:44:28] <Cork> doug65536: i suspect that hw acceleration needs to be turned off for this to be visible
[01:45:24] <doug65536> Cork: it says, "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64...." in my original post. you think they might miss that?
[01:45:25] <Cork> doug65536: i've actually fiddled with this my self, and the reason chrome doesn't get the same slowdown, is cause they don't do it at all in software
[01:45:38] <Cork> doug65536: doesn't matter
[01:45:46] <Cork> if hw acceleration is of or not isn't in the ua
[01:46:07] <doug65536> it's actually worse with HW accel on
[01:46:18] <doug65536> worse framerate. and I have a super-powerful GTX 580
[01:46:36] <doug65536> GTX 580 animating 4 triangles is a joke :D
[01:46:38] <Cork> doug65536: well gtx 580 is an old sucky gpu
[01:47:00] <doug65536> Cork: you're joking right?
[01:47:07] <Successful> http://jsfiddle.net/v2wLa/2/ <-- Trying to preserve kendo grid state in a cookie, but row 39 returns undifined?
[01:47:15] <doug65536> 6xx series is actually slower
[01:47:25] <doug65536> it has 2x pipelines running at half speed
[01:47:31] <Cork> doug65536: or are you talking about nvidia gtx?
[01:47:42] <doug65536> yes nvidia gtx 580
[01:47:58] <doug65536> fermi
[01:48:01] <Cork> ah, then  its still a bit old, but not sucky yet :)
[01:48:17] <Cork> doug65536: proprietary drivers
[01:48:20] <doug65536> I have two... I didn't bother putting second one in last time I messed with it
[01:48:28] <doug65536> yes, the real nvidia drivers, updated 3 days ago
[01:49:11] <Cork> doug65536: i have have a second look at the problem when i get home, my work comps doens't have gpu accelerations
[01:49:23] <doug65536> Cork: really appreciated
[01:50:15] <doug65536> I want to put more animation functionality and keyframing into it - but I'm not spending more time on it as long as it is not properly cross browser
[01:51:18] <anew> cork how could i remove event.preventdefault from a button.  i am using it to have a popu, then ajax.  on success i want the button to work
[01:51:30] <anew> is it better to just hide the button on success and show a new one
[01:51:33] <doug65536> and/or put some physics into it, so things accelerate/collide properly
[01:52:40] <doug65536> anew: you can remove a handler with .off
[01:52:49] <anew> awesome thanks
[01:52:53] <doug65536> anew: you can pass event data that tells the handler whether to prevent default
[01:55:52] <doug65536> anew: $('#my_button').off().on('click', null, should_prevent_default, function(event) { if (event.data) event.preventDefault(); ... })    assuming should_prevent_default is true or false appropriately
[01:55:58] <Cork> eh, no
[01:56:15] <doug65536> why not?
[01:56:22] <Cork> it's better to have a value on the element and skip the preventDefault if it i set
[01:56:34] <anew> what do u mean
[01:56:34] <Cork> cause binding and unbinding event handlers isn't how you should handle logics
[01:56:44] <Nebros> i have to have a look on a code of my friend. http://dpaste.com/1357809/ in this part, i get a warning: inefficient jquery usage. how can i correct this?
[01:56:51] <anew> how do i skip preventdefault ?
[01:57:25] <Cork> anew: $().on('click', function(event) { if($(this).data('disabled')) { event.preventDefault() } }
[01:57:36] <Cork> $().data('disabled', true)
[01:57:41] <Cork> $().data('disabled', false)
[01:58:03] <doug65536> Cork: what's the difference? binding/unbinding just sets hidden data anyway
[01:58:32] <doug65536> in $.data(element)
[01:58:35] <Cork> doug65536: no binding/unbinding runs addEventListener and removeEentListener
[01:58:45] <doug65536> ok, so what?
[01:58:48] <Cork> *removeEventListener
[01:59:28] <Cork> doug65536: firstly it makes listeners into case statements, and it makes code messy
[01:59:47] <anew> hmmm
[01:59:48] <Cork> doug65536: secondly event handlers is more costly to work with then just a value
[01:59:49] <serapath> hihi
[01:59:53] <serapath> oops
[01:59:54] <serapath> hi
[02:00:01] <serapath> have this code
[02:00:03] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/9VN3S1DJ
[02:00:03] <anew> i dont get the true/false part at the end.
[02:00:15] <serapath> problem is, when it initializes, it gives me a function
[02:00:21] <doug65536> messy? imho having data littered around and hardcoding names for data and then reading them in the handler is a lot more "messy" than my suggestion of passing it as event data all in one place
[02:00:25] <serapath> when its called again through onClick, it doesnt
[02:00:28] <anew> when/where do i put that
[02:00:39] <serapath> line 47 to 50
[02:00:55] <Cork> anew: $('#id').on('click', function(event) { if($(this).data('disabled')) { event.preventDefault(); } });
[02:01:03] <anew> yes
[02:01:09] <anew> but how do i know if disabled is true or false
[02:01:13] <Cork> anew: $('#id').data('disabled', true) will disable the element
[02:01:14] <TomiK> doug65536: ... how do I bind twitter bootstrap's typeahead to dynamically created elements ? :)
[02:01:18] <anew> yes
[02:01:22] <Cork> anew: $('#id').data('disabled', false) will enable it again
[02:01:26] <anew> yes
[02:01:30] <serapath> line 49 gives me a function when it runs in the beginning, but not later on, when its triggered through line 15
[02:01:35] <anew> so shouldnt that be inside an else ?
[02:01:54] <Cork> anew: you run it when you want to make the click work
[02:01:56] <serapath> why does that happen? does jquery get rid of the function in the mean time?
[02:01:57] <anew> or inside the original
[02:01:59] <anew> let me pastebin
[02:02:15] <anew> i.e. shouldnt false be right affter preventdefault
[02:02:24] <Cork> anew: or are you talking about retriggering the original event from inside the click event?
[02:02:28] <Cork> anew: no
[02:02:30] <serapath> what does preventdefault do?
[02:02:42] <Cork> serapath: it prevents the browser default action for the event
[02:02:52] <doug65536> TomiK: use .on on a parent of where the dynamically created stuff ends up
[02:02:56] <anew> mmm no... let me see
[02:03:09] <doug65536> TomiK: you haven't really provided enough information to be more specific than that
[02:03:41] <serapath> could anyone give me a hint, why: line 49 logs the function to console when it runs in the beginning, but not later on, when its triggered through line 15?
[02:03:50] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/9VN3S1DJ
[02:04:52] <anew> meh show/hide will take 2 seconds
[02:04:54] <anew> le tme do that that instead
[02:05:19] <Cork> serapath: tagManager != $.fn.tagmanager
[02:05:37] <serapath> yes, but...
[02:05:51] <serapath> ...see line 54
[02:06:08] <Cork> ?demo
[02:06:08] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:06:11] <runtyrobot> Oi! anyone know of a good plugin or method to lazy load divs?
[02:06:19] <Kambfhase> serapath: wow, you have a variable called tagManager, one called tagsManager and even tagManagers. o.O
[02:06:28] <serapath> :D
[02:06:30] <TomiK> doug65536: I'm making a product insert -page where the users can add rows. Some of the fields have typeahead and users can insert rows by pressing button "Add row". This button then creates a new row with same fields (of course with empty fields) and the new row should work exactly like the first row that was generated by PHP
[02:07:02] <Kambfhase> serapath: btw, you can log multiple elements at once: console.log( "foo:", bar, 6789)
[02:07:08] <TomiK> doug65536: the typeahead works on the first row but after insert it doesn't as jquery doesn't know it's there
[02:07:18] <serapath> Kambfhase: thx
[02:08:37] <serapath> Kambfhase, Cork: so tagManager != $.fn.tagmanager, but the first call to tagManager(..) during initialization [thats line 4] makes line 49 log what i expect, but the next call after initialization [thats line 15] makes line 49 log undefined
[02:08:42] <serapath> WHY??? :-)
[02:08:53] <Cork> ?demo
[02:08:53] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:08:57] <serapath> what could be the cause for that behavior?
[02:09:34] <doug65536> TomiK: you probably need to initialize typeahead on the newly created elements
[02:09:37] <Cork> my head's dom + js parser isn't good enough to render pages
[02:10:21] <doug65536> TomiK: you mean typeahead.js right?
[02:10:39] <TomiK> doug65536: I'm using the minified version, but yes
[02:11:23] <doug65536> TomiK: ok, well, what you need to do is run $('...some_selector...').typeahead({ ... options ... }) on the new row of elements when you add it
[02:11:30] <TomiK> doug65536: so just call $(selector).typeahead(options) again
[02:11:34] <TomiK> yes
[02:11:34] <doug65536> yes
[02:12:17] <doug65536> TomiK: in your own code you could be smart and attach it to a parent element, but that may not be the case for things like typeahead.js
[02:12:58] <doug65536> TomiK: you are already initializing typeahead on a parent right?
[02:13:17] <TomiK> doug65536: I have to attach it to specific inputs because the fields need different data
[02:13:37] <doug65536> TomiK: ok
[02:16:08] <doug65536> Cork: do you know how jquery uniquely identifies objects using a raw element reference? like $.data(element...)
[02:16:15] <doug65536> Cork: a linear search?
[02:16:50] <TomiK> doug65536: wrote the typeahead options as global variable and then initialized them again. Works
[02:17:04] <doug65536> TomiK: nice
[02:17:05] <TomiK> doug65536: global is ugly, but .... thanks :)
[02:17:19] <doug65536> TomiK: you almost never need globals in js
[02:17:48] <TomiK> doug65536: how could I do that then without writing the options again ?
[02:18:05] <TomiK> doug65536: typeahead calls are inside functions
[02:18:23] <doug65536> TomiK: just put a variable in your document ready handler - everything is in there already anyway right?
[02:19:08] <doug65536> TomiK: or is that what you're calling "global"
[02:19:14] <TomiK> well, the options = {} is defined inside of $(function)
[02:19:18] <seutje> but jQuery is a global :(
[02:19:26] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[02:19:46] <Cork> doug65536: through jQuery.expando
[02:20:03] <TomiK> doug65536: that's just it
[02:20:05] <doug65536> TomiK: ok, then that's not really global. if you make it var options = ...  then it won't really be global - it will only be accessible from inside the ready function
[02:20:14] <TomiK> yes
[02:20:18] <Cork> doug65536: jquery attaches an expando value to the dom element, and it is the key for the data object in jquery
[02:20:32] <doug65536> Cork: but expando doesn't work in ie right?
[02:20:39] <Cork> doug65536: it does
[02:20:49] <Cork> works in all browsers
[02:20:53] <TomiK> doug65536: I meant it's avaialable in every function inside of $(function) :)
[02:21:23] <doug65536> TomiK: ok, then some other code can't stomp on it, so it isn't *really* global. it's good enough like that
[02:21:33] <serapath> Cork: i do have a link to a live project which logs info to the console. is that ok too? ...instead of a fiddle?
[02:21:59] <doug65536> Cork: really? I remember it not working in ie... must have been fixed since then
[02:22:08] <Cork> serapath: it is, though it is more work
[02:22:25] <serapath> i tried a bit, but failed to replicate on a jsfiddle
[02:22:31] <Cork> doug65536: has always worked
[02:22:52] <serapath> you can see the problem live in the chrome dev tools console:
[02:22:58] <serapath> user: ronald, pass: rastafarian, http://46.231.178.15:8081/account/
[02:23:04] <serapath> (Just Log In and click the cog-wheel in a table row)
[02:23:22] <serapath> => that will execute line 15 from pastebin
[02:23:35] <serapath> => search the chrome console for the console.log of pastebins line 47 to 50
[02:23:48] <serapath> => it appears twice
[02:23:55] <serapath> 1. from during initialization call [line 4 of pastebin]
[02:24:08] <serapath> 2. from clicking the cog-wheel [executes line 15 of pastebin]
[02:25:27] <doug65536> Cork: really? since netscape 1.0? wow
[02:25:57] <Cork> doug65536: well no but since dom1
[02:27:05] <doug65536> Cork: ok. I was actually writing perl websites in ancient times and I distinctly remember using that as a hack and having cross-browser issue. I'm sure that problem is long gone now
[02:27:55] <Cork> doug65536: well yes, in ancient times dom elements could drop values added to them
[02:27:58] <sarahm> hello again , can anyone tell me what's wrong with my code : http://bpaste.net/show/j7qbw480XO5DbOU5cLCI/ . it's supposed to loop for each elem of the xpath and the id arrays and then put it in the correponsing div, but in the div the ajax call is done only one time, seems like it's not in the loop
[02:28:09] <Cork> doug65536: but there shouldn't be any such browser on the market today
[02:28:19] <doug65536> Cork: good to know. thanks
[02:28:21] <Cork> (for a long time that is)
[02:28:34] <Cork> doug65536: and jquery 1.0 wans't THAT long ago
[02:29:01] <doug65536> Cork: I guess I have an unfounded aversion to expando since that problem long ago :)
[02:29:16] <Kambfhase> sarahm: Do you know what lexical scoping means?
[02:29:32] <Cork> doug65536: ya, i have a few of those my self ;)
[02:29:57] <Cork> doug65536: but adding values to the dom was standard long before jquery existed
[02:30:15] <Cork> doug65536: but jquery created data storage, cause old ie browser leaked the attacked values to the dom
[02:30:17] <sarahm> Kambfhase: nope
[02:30:34] <Cork> doug65536: so the expando was the only value added to reduce the memory leak
[02:30:35] <sarahm> Kambfhase:  but then i guess that some of my vars are not on the scope on the ajax function ?
[02:30:46] <doug65536> ah ok
[02:31:53] <Kambfhase> sarahm: yeah, that is the problem. `currentpath` will always point to the last element it looped over.
[02:32:40] <sarahm> Kambfhase: so then i should define my loop inside the ajax call ?
[02:33:45] <Kambfhase> sarahm: Here is an article about the mistake you make: http://jslinterrors.com/dont-make-functions-within-a-loop/
[02:34:03] <Kambfhase> incl. a way to fix it.
[02:34:44] <doug65536> Kambfhase: ah good. I was going to describe a fix :)
[02:35:04] <sarahm> Kambfhase: thank you, i will look into it and try to fix it
[02:35:12] <Kambfhase> doug65536: its a classic error.
[02:35:16] <Kambfhase> :)
[02:35:50] <doug65536> Kambfhase: yeah, sometimes you get carried away with the magic of closures and lose your grip on what is really happening :)
[02:36:32] <Cork> serapath: you load jquery again and overwrite the $.fn functions
[02:37:24] <serapath> oh, ok, i'll look into that. thx
[02:37:27] <serapath> maybe that'll fix it
[02:37:32] <serapath> thx a lot :-)
[02:37:42] <Cork> well that is why all functions is gone from $.fn

[02:56:47] <krupnik> hi all
[02:56:51] <krupnik> in wordpress question: I'm making a .get ajax call on a page to retrieve a local xml file which I then want to parse into a table. I'm using something along the lines of var templateDir = "<?php bloginfo('template_directory') ?>"/path/to/file;
[02:57:15] <krupnik> this keeps returning a 404
[02:57:26] <krupnik> what am i doing wrong?
[02:58:51] <anew> is there a way to delete a div

[03:26:07] <Tingle> small question about javascript, how do I initialize an array so like a["email"] = "somemail" will come out? how would that look like in new Array("email"...?)
[03:27:47] <slikts> Tingle: { 'email': 'somemail' }
[03:28:06] <slikts> Tingle: they're called objects in JS, not arrays
[03:28:12] <Tingle> oh
[03:28:22] <Tingle> so no need for new Array()?
[03:28:29] <slikts> ...
[03:28:58] <slikts> Array is for arrays, which is something else
[03:29:15] <slikts> you'd do good if you look up the basic types in a language you're trying to use
[03:29:40] <Tingle> didnt know there was a differnce inbetween arrays and objects
[03:30:08] <slikts> use php less :P
[03:31:04] <Tingle> I actualy come from a solid c++ background >.> been having to rush mess with html/php/javascript/css and other script/markup crap :P

[03:32:25] <slikts> np
[03:42:43] <clarkk> I am looping through elements in a page using .each, and accumulating them in a <div> element that I have created in the script, so that I don't update the dom until then end of the loops.
[03:42:45] <clarkk> The trouble is, I want to add the CONTENTS of the script div to an existing div in the page, rather than adding the script div to the page div
[03:43:44] <clarkk> how should I be storing the elements in the loop in order to add them to the page at the end?
[03:44:21] <hazardous> hi
[03:44:29] <hazardous> how can i continuously scroll down? i'm loading in more elements every second
[03:44:37] <hazardous> var y = $(window).scrollTop(); $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: y + 800 }, 600); seems to just start slowing down
[03:44:44] <hazardous> after the 3000th element it scrolls by 1px
[03:45:36] <TomiK> how to get the next same level tag ?
[03:46:16] <PapaSierra> morning. i know this is off topic, just looking for anyone with experience in html email templates. htmlemailboilerplate.com has a bunch of resets and best practices. however, gmail doesn't accept the <style> tag. any ideas?
[03:46:20] <TomiK> like <select></select> ... <input> --> when you choose something from select, update the next input with the selected value
[03:47:51] <TomiK> PapaSierra: write style-attributes?
[03:48:28] <PapaSierra> TomiK: i don't get what you mean?
[03:49:00] <TomiK> PapaSierra: This is from one email I got this morning (Gmail) <table width="650" align="center" style="font-size: 14px;" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
[03:49:01] <grafi> inline styles
[03:49:43] <TomiK> I prefer "old school" when making html templates for emails
[03:50:00] <TomiK> they work much better than separate stylesheets/style-tags
[03:50:08] <PapaSierra> as in, boilerplate adds a <style> tag in the head with all the styles. it even has comments that say "this fixes something in gmail". etc. but when you receive it in gmail there are no styles. i'm fully aware of inline styles. i just can't (don't?) believe that http://htmlemailboilerplate.com/ is bogus
[03:50:43] <PapaSierra> sure, i can easily enough change the styles to inline. but i'm pretty shocked. http://htmlemailboilerplate.com/ should be taken offline for wasting time!
[03:50:55] <PapaSierra> like the internet police should arrest him
[03:51:46] <TomiK> well... do as you wish, but inline works best :)
[03:52:14] <PapaSierra> TomiK: that should read "inline works". the other way doesn't ;)
[03:52:22] <TomiK> yep
[03:52:49] <LekeFly> PapaSierra: You are supposed to use a tool to inline it (-:
[03:53:04] <PapaSierra> LekeFly: really?
[03:55:41] <PapaSierra> LekeFly: you mean this? http://beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css
[03:55:50] <PapaSierra> that doesn't work either :(
[03:55:54] <LekeFly> PapaSierra: Yeah
[03:56:03] <LekeFly> Try their email templates, they are on git
[03:56:16] <PapaSierra> it just stripped out the <style>
[03:56:24] <PapaSierra> ah ok, you've got to use their templates. fine
[03:56:38] <TomiK> anyone... how to get access on same level tags ?
[03:57:09] <TomiK> $(this).parent().children('input').val('xxx') doesn't work
[03:58:18] <Cork> ?api sibling
[03:58:18] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[03:58:21] <Cork> ?api siblings
[03:58:23] <b-ot> Cork: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[03:59:12] <Cork> TomiK: though if they really where the same level parent().children() should work too
[03:59:36] <TomiK> Cork: I'll make a pastebin... a sec
[04:01:52] <TomiK> Cork: http://pastebin.com/pC5HM5zq
[04:02:34] <Cork> TomiK: and in what context is the code running?
[04:02:42] <TomiK> Cork: I have typeahead that suggests brand and model, after selecting I process them and then I'd like to place the brand and model individually in the inputs
[04:02:47] <TomiK> context?
[04:02:53] <Cork> keyup?
[04:02:54] <Cork> change?
[04:03:00] <Cork> or something else?
[04:03:06] <Cork> and on what element
[04:03:07] <TomiK> typeahead updater
[04:03:14] <TomiK> it processes the selected value
[04:03:37] <Cork> TomiK: i mean what element is this in your code?
[04:04:19] <TomiK> Cork: I'm not sure if I follow you, but typeahead is the first input (#brand_model)
[04:05:00] <doug65536> sidd: hi
[04:05:00] <Cork> and this.id == 'brand_model' ?
[04:05:13] <sidd> hi, oh, you're here as well. :)
[04:05:18] <TomiK> Cork: I'll check what it returns
[04:05:21] <sidd> ok, so my code is something like this:
[04:05:38] <sidd> var name = $("#name").val();
[04:05:54] <doug65536> sidd: can you post on jsfiddle.net?
[04:05:58] <TomiK> Cork: actually returns undefined... so that just might be the problem
[04:06:07] <sidd> doug65536: ok.
[04:06:10] <Cork> TomiK: console.log(this)
[04:06:11] <hazardous> i have a $.each($.getJSON) but it's not
[04:06:14] <hazardous> loading in the correct order
[04:06:14] <TomiK> there is no parent or anything
[04:06:20] <hazardous> is there any way to make it load in the 'correct' order by index
[04:06:21] <Cork> TomiK: then inspect what it is
[04:06:25] <hazardous> or is it literally just whatever returns first goes first
[04:06:43] <doug65536> sidd: then I can edit it and post you back a link or even test/debug it
[04:06:49] <Cork> hazardous: is it an array?
[04:07:01] <Cork> hazardous: else you would have to sort it manually
[04:07:09] <Cork> hazardous: objects don't have an order
[04:07:26] <Cork> [] <-- array {1: "value"} <-- object
[04:07:45] <Cork> * ["value"] <-- array {1: "value"} <-- object
[04:07:45] <hazardous> Cork: no, it's html
[04:07:48] <hazardous> that is .prepend()'d
[04:07:58] <hazardous> (the source of the json is entirely out of my control)
[04:08:03] <Cork> uh.. you try to parse html with getJSON?
[04:08:13] <hazardous> it returns {"obj":"giant block of html"}
[04:08:24] <Cork> then you have an object, not html
[04:08:27] <hazardous> which kind of makes me want to punch someone, but still
[04:08:27] <TomiK> cork: Firebug: Element / Context / id = brand_model
[04:08:35] <starfox21> So I am trying to do a live change demo, where I have one page with a few input fields where users input hex colors, and then I have an iframe (from the same domain), embedded in that page. The behavior I am trying to get is the following: When users select colors, certain elements in the page inside the iframe change.
[04:08:35] <Cork> hazardous: like i said, objects don't have an order
[04:08:45] <hazardous> cork: can i make it obey the index
[04:08:51] <hazardous> i have $.each going through an array
[04:08:51] <starfox21> The way I am trying to do this is by listening to the onchange event on the input fields. When the onchange event happens I do this: $(document.getElementById('iframe')).find('body').css('color', new_color). The problem is that this is not really changing the style of the body element in the DOM. Instead it seems to be changing a copy of the body element.
[04:08:58] <Cork> hazardous: no, cause it doens't have an index
[04:09:08] <Cork> hazardous: you need to use an array if you want it to keep an order
[04:09:08] <hazardous> i mean, $.each is using an array
[04:09:08] <sidd> doug65536: oh, thats great. i have just typed the code in the javascript part of the screen. what do i do next? should i sign up?
[04:09:13] <doug65536> starfox21: the iframe is unnecessary?
[04:09:19] <doug65536> sidd: press save and post the link here
[04:09:37] <hazardous> starfox21: i'm reasonably sure that is not going to work in an iframe because iframes are supposed to be sandboxed anyays
[04:09:38] <Cork> hazardous: no, $.each can loop both objects and arrays
[04:09:56] <doug65536> sidd: save at the top
[04:10:12] <hazardous> cork: i know that
[04:10:21] <hazardous> i mean, $.each is going through an array for the urls it getJSONs from
[04:10:25] <Cork> no
[04:10:28] <doug65536> starfox21: what is the point of the iframe?
[04:10:29] <starfox21> doug65536: yh, i have tried to do this without iframes, but the problem is that there is a lot of css, and the css belonging to both pages is conflicting.
[04:10:30] <Cork> it's going through an object
[04:10:36] <hazardous> what do you mean
[04:11:01] <sidd> doug65536: the url is jsfiddle.net/8Cqrr
[04:11:03] <hazardous> i have var k = ["/x", "/y", "/z"], "/z" should be index 2
[04:11:04] <starfox21> hazardous: but if both frames are in the same domain shouldn't this be possible?
[04:11:10] <Cork> hazardous: { "10": "a", "5": "b", "100": "c" } will stay in that order
[04:11:29] <Cork> hazardous: and if you really do have that array it will
[04:11:30] <Tingle> ok I have a realy wierd issue, FF web console isnt throwing any javascript error or the sort, but after I use a function, the script breaks and no javascript works anymore
[04:11:34] <hazardous> ok
[04:11:39] <Tingle> what could cause this
[04:11:44] <sidd> doug65536: i have put the function and the output it is giving. it is a codeigniter project with php backend.
[04:11:54] <hazardous> is ther eany way i can have the prepend returned respect that? or should i just pre-create named divs like <div data-order="2"/> and .html() into them
[04:12:03] <Cork> hazardous: just make sure the json is an array, and not a number keyed object
[04:12:15] <Tingle> it worked just fine, then I added a new function, and since then it breaks . I removed the new function and reverted everything back to the way it was, but it still breaks
[04:12:30] <starfox21> doug65536: if I have access to the elements inside of the iframe, shouldn't I be able to change the css properties of those elements?
[04:12:40] <serapath> Cork: thx again, i fixed my problem :-)
[04:12:42] <doug65536> sidd: this should work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/1/
[04:12:43] <sidd> doug65536: i need to have the individual values of weight, customerid etc to be put in form elements in the same file at run time
[04:13:02] <doug65536> sidd: oops http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/2/
[04:13:04] <Cork> hazardous: dom don't care about js values
[04:13:17] <Cork> hazardous: so you would have to make sure to append them in the correct order
[04:14:03] <sidd> doug65536: thanks a lot. was stuck with this. will try it out now.
[04:14:05] <doug65536> sidd: ok, I can show that but I don't know the html of the form. can you put the form html in this fiddle at the top left? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/4/
[04:14:50] <seutje> sidd: is this drupal?
[04:15:05] <sidd> seutje: codeigniter.
[04:17:02] <seutje> sidd: oh, ok... drupal uses the same base_url(), but has better ways to transfer data between php and js
[04:18:05] <sidd> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/5/ is the update with html
[04:19:20] <doug65536> sidd: are you typing everything out? why not copy/paste
[04:19:25] <serapath> @anyone: are u familiar with http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager ? it tells me, that it will give me a list of tags if i do:  $('myTagManagerDomElement').tagsManager('tags'); // it would give me all tags added, but doesnt work
[04:20:08] <sidd> doug65536: i have put the barcode input box now at 6. the machine where the coding is happening does not have internet connectivity :(
[04:20:29] <doug65536> sidd: this should work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/7/
[04:20:36] <doug65536> oops
[04:20:48] <doug65536> sidd: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/8/
[04:22:34] <sidd> doug65536: thanks a lot. you're a life saver :)
[04:22:51] <doug65536> sidd: note that I fixed the duplicate id and wrong code for <label.. should be for="..." not id="...
[04:22:59] <doug65536> sidd: yw
[04:23:05] <Tingle> all scripts/functions inside my scripts.js would not work if I have a syntax error somewhere in the file correct?
[04:23:46] <doug65536> Tingle: I don't think that is defined behavior
[04:23:59] <doug65536> Tingle: meaning, maybe, maybe not
[04:24:23] <Tingle> I have this wierd issue that all functions no longer work after I execute this one function
[04:24:46] <doug65536> Tingle: the browser will abandon execution of the code on the first uncaught exception, yes
[04:24:58] <Tingle> I dont see whats wrong here
[04:25:10] <Tingle> http://hastebin.com/ticotevute.vhdl
[04:25:26] <Tingle> after that is executed, which it does just fine, all other things stop working
[04:26:16] <doug65536> Tingle: body is superfluous
[04:26:30] <doug65536> Tingle: but I doubt that code causes anything bad to happen
[04:26:39] <Tingle> same
[04:26:47] <grafi> serapath that works for me, whats the problem?
[04:26:51] <doug65536> Tingle: look in console
[04:26:51] <Tingle> because that code just like that worked just fine
[04:26:56] <Tingle> I am
[04:27:00] <Tingle> console isnt telling me anything
[04:27:23] <doug65536> Tingle: remove body from selector. where did you expect it to look?
[04:27:40] <seutje> the head!
[04:27:44] <doug65536> lol
[04:27:48] <seutje> got some divs up in my dome
[04:28:18] <Nebros> i have there a little problem. http://dpaste.com/1357809/ in this part, i get a warning: inefficient jquery usage. how can i correct this?
[04:28:48] <Tingle> mm no differnce
[04:28:52] <Tingle> still breaks
[04:28:54] <Tingle> no errors
[04:29:25] <doug65536> Tingle: you are looking in wrong place. there's no way that code is blowing up your page
[04:29:59] <doug65536> Tingle: console doesn't say $ is undefined or something stupid right?
[04:30:04] <Tingle> nop
[04:30:05] <Tingle> e
[04:31:29] <doug65536> Nebros: ignore it
[04:31:47] <doug65536> Nebros: there's nothing wrong with that code
[04:31:51] <Tingle> also, this markup validator is telling me something goofy
[04:32:00] <Tingle> http://validator.w3.org/
[04:32:08] <Tingle> says: Line 7, Column 78: Bad value title for attribute name on element meta: Keyword title is not registered.
[04:32:26] <Tingle> but I dont have a meta tag with the name title :O
[04:33:20] <Nebros> doug65536: ok, but is there a variant to make it better looking?
[04:33:21] <doug65536> Nebros: only an idiot would optimize something that runs once like that - it would take milliseconds at worst to find that element. it happens one time. your tool is giving false positives
[04:34:35] <doug65536> Nebros: I can give you different ways to say the same thing, but it would be a waste of time to use them
[04:35:31] <doug65536> Nebros: try these more inefficient ways: 1) var gallery = $('#gallery); $('a', gallery).lightBox().     2) $('#gallery').find('a').lightBox()
[04:35:50] <Nebros> :D
[04:36:28] <Nebros> doug65536: ok thanks a lot, i think i let it be. :)
[04:37:17] <doug65536> Nebros: yeah, code analysis tools give false warnings sometimes - they can't help it
[04:39:40] <doug65536> Tingle: on what page?
[04:39:56] <Tingle> you want to look at it?
[04:40:09] <doug65536> Tingle: I find it hard to believe it screwed that up. sure
[04:40:20] <Tingle> k sec, whats your ip
[04:40:37] <doug65536> my IP? just /msg doug65536 me
[04:40:46] <Tingle> i need to whitelist you to the website
[04:40:53] <Tingle> or else you get a under construction thing
[04:41:12] <doug65536>  174.138.220.74
[04:41:13] <Tingle> nvm found it
[04:41:39] <doug65536> but wait though, you need to whitelist the validator server right?
[04:41:50] <Tingle> ah true
[04:41:52] <Tingle> lulz
[04:42:05] <doug65536> Tingle: your under construction page has that error
[04:42:07] <doug65536> probably
[04:42:15] <Tingle> but yeah, not my issue atm - the js stuff is that breaks everything is a pain
[04:42:34] <doug65536> Tingle: I'll try to investigate the screwup if you want
[04:42:57] <Tingle> yeah
[04:43:02] <Tingle> https://www.twotax.com/?p=home
[04:43:06] <Tingle> top right, hit login
[04:43:08] <Tingle> then cancle
[04:43:13] <Tingle> cancle wont work anymore
[04:43:19] <doug65536> I'm not whitelisted
[04:43:47] <Tingle> k try now
[04:43:54] <doug65536> works...
[04:44:01] <Nebros> ok, my program will stress me. it says that "width" "cellspacing" and "cellpadding" are not allowed in a table. doug65536 i think you are right if you say my tool is giving false positives...
[04:44:25] <serapath> grafi, i dont know, i do a console log and it just logs the dom element to the console
[04:44:47] <doug65536> Nebros: it is actually trying to say, use css for that, using attributes is obsolete
[04:45:01] <doug65536> Nebros: but it will work with what you have
[04:45:33] <Tingle> so yeah, as you can see it breaks for no apearent reason :O
[04:45:37] <Tingle> no error
[04:45:38] <Tingle> no nothin
[04:45:46] <seutje> legacy support still require them though :/
[04:46:22] <Tingle> doug65536, could you pm me what ever you say, I need to go cook
[04:46:51] <Tingle> or tag my name so I know you said something to me
[04:46:59] <Nebros> hmm ok with css it will be better if i need this page on diffrent browsers.
[04:47:48] <doug65536> Tingle: sure
[04:48:26] <serapath> grafi: funny thing is, if i do 'pushtag" to add another one, it works. what actually is supposed to happen when i do 'tags' ?
[04:48:31] <seutje> Nebros: by legacy support, I mean IE7 and under
[04:48:58] <doug65536> Tingle: the cache buster on your script is making it really hard to debug
[04:49:22] <Tingle> and incase your wondering, no im not getting paid to make that page :/ its a favor :P
[04:49:27] <Tingle> cache buster
[04:49:31] <Tingle> want me to disable it
[04:49:49] <doug65536> I'll hack around it by putting a breakpoint in jquery
[04:50:07] <Tingle> k
[04:50:08] <Tingle> afk
[04:50:13] <Tingle> and thx
[04:51:39] <sarahm> hi again. I have two arrays one for values , values =['foo','bar'] and the other for text=['FOO','BAR'] where the nth item in values corresponds to the nth item in text. i get a value from a server and want to localise it in the values array then display the corresponding text from the text array, i wanted to know if there's a function that compares two arrays or something, or i should just write it with ifs and loops
[04:55:31] <Cork> sarahm: text[$.inArray(values, 'val')]
[04:55:54] <Cork> sarahm: or you might want to go with an object instead
[04:56:00] <Cork> sarahm: would make things easier
[04:56:14] <doug65536> Tingle: $('body div.login_form input.cancelButton') matches nothing, it is login_panel, not login_form
[04:56:22] <Cork> sarahm: {'foo': 'FOO', 'bar': 'BAR'}
[04:56:49] <sarahm> Cork: i don't get what the values and 'val' in the inArray function are foor ?
[04:57:03] <Cork> sarahm: the value you want translated
[04:57:15] <Cork> sarahm: var trans = {'foo': 'FOO', 'bar': 'BAR'}; trans['val']
[04:57:21] <sarahm> Cork: ur second example is a dict so u can have for example text = dict[value] ?
[04:57:39] <Cork> js> var trans = {'foo': 'FOO', 'bar': 'BAR'}; print(trans['foo'])
[04:57:47] <b-ot> Cork: FOO
[04:57:53] <seutje> no need to shout :(
[04:58:03] <Cork> lol
[04:58:07] <sarahm> haha
[04:58:16] <sarahm> Cork:  yep perfect, better than the arrays
[05:01:41] <Tingle> doug65536 omg thank you, I forgot to rename login_form to login_panel in the scripts.js >.< ffs what a stupid issue
[05:01:53] <doug65536> Tingle: yw
[05:03:05] <doug65536> Tingle: you can go to the console and evaluate $('body div.login_form input.cancelButton') and see that the response is []  indicating that the selector doesn't match anything. it's a great debugging trick
[05:07:24] <Xzanron> is it possible to use $.when() with a boolean?  e.g. var flag = false; $.when(flag).then(stuff)  ?
[05:08:00] <doug65536> Xzanron: no
[05:08:29] <doug65536> Xzanron: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[05:08:51] <doug65536> Xzanron: it is impossible for jquery to do that anyway
[05:09:16] <Xzanron> doug65536: Direct :) . I have a class with depends on an iframe being fully loaded. I've tried protecting all methods with $(iframe).load(stuff) but that's cousing me problems. Any suggestions on how I might solve this?
[05:09:46] <lundy> heya guys, how can I take the value of a input and where the first space in it is, replace it with a @ sign ............. wot im trying to do is take the value from "RealName" and create a Email address e.g: John@Smith.com
[05:09:56] * Xzanron ashamed of all the typos in that last message
[05:09:59] <doug65536> Xzanron: you have complete control over the content of the iframe?
[05:10:12] <krupnik> question: I'd like to write a function to check a file to see if it's been updated and then if it has reload another. Both files are xml and local to my domain.
[05:10:29] <krupnik> any pointers gratefully received.
[05:10:29] <Xzanron> doug65536: I do, yes
[05:11:02] <Xzanron> doug65536: you going ot suggest putting $.ready in the iframe
[05:11:07] <Xzanron> ?
[05:12:48] <doug65536> Xzanron: well, yes, but I am hesitant to say anything without knowing what sort of problems
[05:13:00] <doug65536> Xzanron: the problem might be something easily fixed
[05:13:48] <lundy> heya guys, how can I take the value of a input and where the first space in it is, replace it with a @ sign ............. wot im trying to do is take the value from "RealName" and create a Email address e.g: John@Smith.com
[05:13:49] <Xzanron> krupnik: my first step would be to look at the headers of the file. And see if there's a timestamp in there you can use.
[05:14:13] <krupnik> the file has a timestamp field
[05:14:33] <krupnik> thx Xzanron btw
[05:14:46] <krupnik> so would I query this and write a counter for it
[05:14:47] <krupnik> ?
[05:15:04] <doug65536> js> "Doug 65536".replace(/\s/, '@')
[05:15:07] <krupnik> and use this to trigger an if statement which would then call the reload?
[05:15:11] <b-ot> '): No output.
[05:15:18] <doug65536> ah, stupid bot
[05:15:23] <doug65536> js> print("Doug 65536".replace(/\s/, '@'))
[05:15:32] <b-ot> ')): Doug@65536
[05:16:28] <lundy> js> "John Smith JNR".replace(/\s/, '@'))
[05:16:35] <b-ot> ')): No output.
[05:16:51] <doug65536> ah, but wait though, you don't want the last name...
[05:16:59] <lundy> js> print("John Smirth JNR".replace(/\s/, '@'))
[05:17:07] <b-ot> ')): John@Smirth JNR
[05:17:09] <Xzanron> doug65536: I'm basically trying to write some guards for functions. A semaphore. I basically want the call to iframe.src("url") to be synchronous. Ideally i'd like to call thread.sleep(0) and so that all (my) javascript code is blocked until the iframe has loaded.
[05:17:20] <doug65536> js> print('Doug 65536'.match(/^\S+/)[0])
[05:17:26] <b-ot> doug65536: Doug
[05:18:10] <doug65536> Xzanron: never ever try to "block" you will just hang the browser.
[05:18:43] <doug65536> Xzanron: very unlikely to work. it's an awful hack that sucks. sorry
[05:19:04] <Xzanron> doug65536: I know.. hence my attempt at creating a semaphore. Wrapping everything in timeout's seems clunky to me.
[05:19:35] <doug65536> Xzanron: less clunky than an implementation that hangs and crashes your page when the script times out waiting for something that is probably never going to happen
[05:19:39] <Xzanron> doug65536: I think the problem is that some calls to iframe.load() are happening after it's already loaded, so they just never fire
[05:19:49] <doug65536> Xzanron: yes...
[05:20:53] <doug65536> Xzanron: what I do is set src="about:blank" then in code, I setup the .load handler, and then .attr('src', url') the iframe
[05:20:59] <doug65536> Xzanron: then I am guaranteed to get load event
[05:22:25] <doug65536> Xzanron: sorry, not .load... .on('load'...
[05:23:15] <Xzanron> doug65536: unfortunatly i'm working in bespoke framework that makes that tricky... Thanks for the help.. you've given me some ideas.
[05:23:50] <doug65536> Xzanron: other possibilities would be postMessage and .on('message' to "communicate" with the iframe
[05:24:06] <doug65536> Xzanron: but if it's on your domain you might be able to "reach into" the iframe and check something anyway
[05:24:15] <anli> If I do .slideUp on a div and immediately afterwards .slideDown (two code lines afterwards), will the result be slideDown?
[05:24:46] <krupnik> Xzanron: where would you go from checking the timestamp. Thanks :)
[05:25:52] <Xzanron> krupnik: depends on how you load the xml originally. Essentially you'd just be polling the file and looking to see if it's changed. If it has, then depending on how you polled it, you'd actually already have the file.
[05:25:59] <doug65536> anli: it will queue them I think
[05:26:37] <doug65536> anli: if you do .stop(true, false).slideUp()    then  .stop(true, false).slideDown()   it will not queue them, it will go straight to slideDown
[05:26:40] <Xzanron> krupnik: not something i've ever done before, so i'm just speculating
[05:27:08] <krupnik> Xzanron: thanks for speculating - I'm using a .get call to fetch the xml locally
[05:27:43] <doug65536> krupnik: good luck with local ajax
[05:27:56] <lundy> js> print("John Smirth JNR".replace(/\s/, '@'))
[05:27:58] <doug65536> krupnik: chrome has many bugs with file:///
[05:28:04] <b-ot> ')): John@Smirth JNR
[05:28:16] <anli> doug65536: thanks
[05:28:18] <Xzanron> If the xml file is large, then you're creating a lot of network traffic, since you'll be getting the whole file all the time
[05:28:31] <krupnik> doug65536: I know , meant on same domain rather than local
[05:28:46] <Xzanron> Your best bet would be a simple server side script that you can call and that lets you know if the file has changed, only then get the file again
[05:29:07] <krupnik> Xzanron: thx - I'll investigate this with our server guy
[05:29:53] <rynkan> you could just do it oldschool: el.find('.nav li.eq('+id+')').addClass('active').siblings().removeClass('active')
[05:30:02] <rynkan> wrng chan
[05:30:37] <rynkan> hmm its still jquery-relevant tho..
[05:33:07] <doonie> thats some nasty traversing ;D
[05:35:11] <doug65536> krupnik: how often will that data change? you could have the server set a really long expiry time on the response, and if you use a GET request to fetch the XML the browser can cache it
[05:35:45] <rynkan> doonie: i know but it tends to be how i go on doing it :/
[05:35:48] <doug65536> krupnik: you can always override the cache with a cache buster, or $.ajax(... { cache: false } ...
[05:36:17] <krupnik> doug65536: That data changes minute to minute
[05:37:11] <rynkan> isnt there a backbone.js chan on freenode?
[05:37:27] <serapath> i'm using https://github.com/max-favilli/tagmanager and it allows to specify a jquery selector for a container that should contain added tags. i add 2 tag managers to my page, with the first one it works, with the second one it doesnt
[05:37:52] <krupnik> rynkan: #documentcloud
[05:39:09] <serapath> with the first one, the tags are added to <div id="#tags-tgInput"></div>, but for the second, they are added to <input name="hidden-a000000046" type="hidden" value="Gender,Age,Lib lib"> ...to the value attribute instead of <div id="#tags-a000000046"></div>
[05:39:18] <rynkan> krupnik: thanks! TIL "Backbone is an open-source component of DocumentCloud." cool
[05:39:21] <grafi> sorry serapath was afk eating
[05:39:32] <serapath> hi grafi
[05:39:34] <serapath> :-)
[05:40:08] <grafi> when you do the tags things it returns an array with the tags you currently have
[05:40:19] <serapath> doesnt do that for me
[05:40:32] <grafi> have a fiddle or some site?
[05:40:33] <serapath> returns the dom element instead
[05:40:36] <serapath> yes a site
[05:40:42] <serapath> just a second
[05:40:46] <grafi> kk
[05:41:06] <doug65536> serapath: then wrap jquery around the element with $(element)
[05:41:29] <krupnik> rynkan: no worries
[05:42:15] <doug65536> serapath: lots of things strip off the jquery wrapper and end up as a raw element. even $.each does that
[05:47:13] <doug65536> serapath: ah, sorry I misunderstood
[05:48:33] <serapath> ok grafi
[05:48:39] <serapath> see the problem live in the chrome dev tools console:
[05:48:44] <serapath> user: ronald, pass: rastafarian, http://46.231.178.15:8081/account/
[05:48:51] <serapath> This is my pastebin: http://pastebin.com/xXR1qCdp
[05:49:06] <serapath> PROBLEM1: 1. the execution of line 45 to 51 of that pastebin
[05:49:15] <serapath> (Just Log In and click the cog-wheel in a table row, add some tags and press SAVE)
[05:49:25] <serapath> => that will execute pastebins lines 45 to 51 , but not show the "list of tags" in console
[05:49:37] <serapath> PROBLEM2: 2. line 64,65 and 97 (they specify where the added tags shall be put
[05:49:45] <serapath> (Just Log In and click the "Partner Tab" -> If you add tags, they are shown),
[05:49:51] <serapath> but: If you do the same in the cog-wheel few (as above), they are NOT shown.
[05:51:29] <serapath> any ideas what i'm missing?
[05:54:49] <grafi> phew ... trying to comprehend what you are doing :P
[05:55:08] <serapath> ok, in the "partner tab" there is a general configuration happening
[05:55:24] <serapath> the same configuration can be individualized for all table elements (rows)
[05:55:32] <grafi> yeah
[05:55:40] <serapath> the "config" contains a "tag manager"
[05:56:10] <serapath> so if there are 100 rows in the table, then there should be 101 tag managers
[05:56:16] <serapath> the general one and one for each table row
[05:57:26] <serapath> i'm using a template for that "configuration" and if a cog-wheel is clicked, i add the tag manager for that row-element to the "configuration view"
[05:58:07] <serapath> problem1 is a problem, because on SAVE, i want to get all tags in order to send them to the backend via socketIO
[05:58:40] <serapath> problem2 is a problem, because tags are not shown for the cog-wheel views, but only for the general view
[05:59:46] <serapath> i wonder what the difference is between the general tag manager view (it shows tags added/removed) and the cog-wheel-row-specific tag manager view (it DOESNT show tags added/removed)
[06:00:56] <grafi> i see
[06:00:56] <grafi> hm
[06:00:56] <grafi> have no immediate solution though :P
[06:02:09] <serapath> any ideas what i should look for? didnt u say the .tagsManager('tags'); method gave u the list of tags?
[06:02:41] <grafi> let me show you the fiddle i did
[06:02:47] <serapath> k
[06:03:13] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/jHtca/
[06:03:24] <grafi> i just pasted the css/js in to the boxes
[06:03:54] <grafi> when you scroll all the way down in the js box you see the initialization and the .tagsManager('tags')
[06:04:07] <grafi> and the devtools console will show you the array
[06:05:18] <serapath> ah, u are using v3
[06:05:21] <serapath> i'm still on v2.x
[06:06:19] <grafi> hm maybe thats a problem
[06:08:29] <airdem> how come i have to click twice into a input field to activate its datalist?
[06:08:37] <airdem> can i reduce that to onle click?
[06:09:53] <grafi> serapath according to the 2.x docs there doesnt seem to be any way to get all the tags out of it ... at least I couldnt find it ...
[06:10:09] <serapath> really?
[06:10:14] <jop008> is it possible to show a date calendar when field is readonly? on a date field?
[06:10:16] <grafi> he lists only 3 methods, pop, push and empty in there
[06:11:16] <grafi> what about just replacing your 2.x with the up to date one? do you think that would break things for you?
[06:11:46] <serapath> i see
[06:11:47] <serapath> damn
[06:11:51] <serapath> that would explain it
[06:12:02] <serapath> but still would not explain why i cant see the tags in that popup
[06:12:08] <grafi> true
[06:12:14] <serapath> it works in the general view
[06:12:41] <serapath> but thx for pointing me to this, because now i know i have to change to v3 or implement 'tag gathering' myself
[06:12:46] <serapath> ...which i will probably do
[06:12:54] <serapath> i'll use v3 in my next project
[06:12:56] <grafi> good luck with that
[06:12:59] <serapath> :D
[06:13:16] <serapath> i've already figured, that there is span's added to the container, where each span contains one tag
[06:13:28] <serapath> i can read them in with a custom function, thats ok
[06:14:01] <serapath> at least in the general thing... its not that easy with the popup, because it doesnt add the tags where its supposed to add them
[06:24:49] <bnason> Does anyone know if there is a way to do a 3d 'flip' animation that works in at least IE9? Like this, http://tympanus.net/Development/BookBlock/
[06:28:33] <ezrafree> hello
[06:29:11] <ezrafree> i have a text input that is being created on the fly (using bootstrap popover) how could i select all the text on the input when focus is given to it?
[06:29:37] <ezrafree> my normal attempts of $(this).select(); are not working
[06:33:09] <Cork> ?g jquery input focus select text
[06:33:10] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Howto: Select text in input box on user select or focus → http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/04/select-text-in-input-box-on-user-select.html
[06:33:48] <ezrafree> Cork: yes, I know how to do it normally, but my question revolves around "what if the text input was created dynamically?"
[06:34:34] <Cork> ezrafree: shouldn't matter
[06:34:50] <Cork> you need to trigger it after the element has been created, that's all
[06:35:06] <ezrafree> Cork: how could i trigger it after the element has been created though?
[06:35:15] <ezrafree> is this a limitation in bootstrap's popover() ?
[06:35:31] <Cork> ezrafree: well how are you creating it with popover?
[06:36:41] <ezrafree> Cork: http://pastebin.com/6MM9Gcwv
[06:37:09] <ezrafree> sorry, the :not() stuff just hides the popover if you click elsewhere, you can disregard that part
[06:38:15] <Cork> ezrafree: replace $('.cloneurl').on('focus', function
[06:38:31] <Cork> with $(document).on('focus', '.cloneurl', function
[06:39:05] <ezrafree> ahh, i was trying (at one point) to do: $(window, '.cloneurl')
[06:39:36] <FuryFoo> Hi everyone
[06:40:45] <FuryFoo> Simple question - what am I doing wrong here : http://pastebin.com/Q35ivMuC
[06:40:46] <FuryFoo> Upon submitting the form I get a error message and no email.
[06:40:51] <FuryFoo> Please have a look
[06:40:51] <ezrafree> Cork: thank you! works perfectly now
[06:42:33] <FuryFoo> I think I'm doing the function call wrong but I'm not sure
[06:42:41] <_Jens> FuryFoo: which error message do you get?
[06:43:16] <FuryFoo> My alert pops up
[06:44:04] <FuryFoo> I think AJAX hates being called into another function but I'm not sure
[06:44:32] <obert> just try: if he will kick you, he hates that
[06:44:50] <FuryFoo> You can see the commented code in the send function - with that it works great
[06:46:36] <FuryFoo> I realize that i could sanitize the input in the send function but I'm thinking that if I put the AJAX in a if I'll get something similar
[06:49:55] <jop008> Can there be a timing issue between this statements ?           $("#period").trigger ("create");
[06:49:56] <jop008>           $('#vwperiod').trigger('collapse');
[06:50:08] <jop008> my collapse is not happening
[06:50:25] <jop008> collapsible set
[06:51:14] <FuryFoo> So anyone with an idea ?
[06:57:19] <seutje> fury: the return in send is useless, it's not being caught or returned along in sanitize
[06:57:35] <seutje> I meant furyfoo, but I guess he left
[06:58:11] <seutje> jop008: got a (non-)working example?
[07:04:04] <jop008> Yes see http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/101/
[07:04:15] <jop008> bla must not be there
[07:06:56] <Kambfhase> jop008: not sure what you are trying to do, but may be you need to move the period div into the vwperiod
[07:07:17] <jop008> collapse content
[07:07:44] <jop008> I try it hx
[07:09:24] <jop008> works!
[07:09:29] <sandstrom> I'm on the hunt for a light-weight templating/ui/bindings framework to build simple js/html widgets that will be included in an otherwise static, informative website. Not a complete framework like ember/angular/backbone, but something lightweight. React.js is the closest I've found so far -- suggestions are much appreciated!
[07:09:34] <Kambfhase> yay
[07:10:12] <yannickoo> hey guys, how can i get all <tr> which hast MULTIPLE <td>? $('table > tr:has(td)') is not enough
[07:10:57] <Kambfhase> $('table > tr:has(td+td)')
[07:11:01] <Kambfhase> may be
[07:12:25] <SuRfDeMoN> yannickoo: could you check for a nth child
[07:12:54] <wrp6> Is anyone having issues building th laest jQuery ?
[07:12:57] <wrp6> *the latest
[07:13:29] <tw2113> nope
[07:13:33] <wrp6> It's my first time really building something in JS, so I could be doing something wrong. But the sizzle source path was wrong in the Gruntfile.js, and now it's outputting errors for large swaths of minified code
[07:13:43] <wrp6> Any common mistakes that could lead to this?
[07:14:19] <wrp6> (This is the output of grunt)
[07:14:31] <yannickoo> is there an online service which compiles jquery for you? where you can customize the components?
[07:14:44] <tw2113> no idea, i've never compiled my own version
[07:14:53] <Kambfhase> yannickoo: there used to be
[07:14:56] <tw2113> but in terms of using any build, no issue :D
[07:15:14] <Kambfhase> yannickoo: http://projects.jga.me/jquery-builder/
[07:15:24] <yannickoo> Kambfhase: so!
[07:17:53] <ReBa_> Hi! Does anyone knows a plugin or a method to know if someone has seen a part of my site (like has he seen my table row?) with jquery/javascript?
[07:18:07] <ReBa_> Something similar to facebook's has read...
[07:19:35] <Kambfhase> ReBa google for "Page visibility" API
[07:23:32] <ReBa_> Kambfhase: It's more like really a chunk of the site. If you have a table that is to large, I should know what table-rows are visible and what aren't (so not the whole page, but rather what is really visbile)
[07:24:06] <Kambfhase> $(foo).is(':visible')
[07:26:05] <anli> Is firebug not stable at the moment? Seems like I have to restart firefox to display console events correctly from time to time
[07:27:02] <slax0r> I've stopped using it like 2 years ago because of it's buggyness
[07:27:14] <ReBa_> Kambfhase: Will try with that, thanks :)
[07:28:19] <anli> slax0r: using chrome instead?
[07:28:25] <slax0r> zup
[07:28:26] <slax0r> yup*
[07:28:27] <slax0r> darn
[07:28:30] <anli> lol
[07:28:35] <Kambfhase> Firebug is ok for me.
[07:28:46] <slax0r> used on qwerty and am on qwertz now :)
[07:28:53] <anli> haha
[07:29:19] <SuRfDeMoN> slax0r: try dvorak :)
[07:29:32] <Kambfhase> ^^
[07:29:32] <anli> try abcdef
[07:30:03] <slax0r> nah, qwerty for development
[07:30:13] <slax0r> qwertz for chatting, whil I need those non-asciis :P
[07:30:33] <slax0r> s/whil/while
[07:30:40] <slax0r> and I need typing instructions it seems
[07:30:47] <SuRfDeMoN> haha
[07:30:49] <anli> heh
[07:31:08] <SuRfDeMoN> I use dvorak for all
[07:31:55] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/103/ I try to change the h3 param of the collapsible set
[07:32:39] <loincloth> hey.. is this a reasonable way to override ui.tooltip defaults in 1.8? $.extend($.ui.tooltip.prototype.options, { show: false, hide: false });
[07:34:51] <Kambfhase> seems legit
[07:36:03] <zth> i need to call a URL at the click of a button, but i'd prefer it if it didn't open a new window/tab/anything at all. can i do this somehow with jquery?
[07:36:09] <Cronoh> why is a text value of 99.00 evaluting to 99.001 or 99.01 when roudned ? Wth
[07:36:32] <slax0r> jop008, use text instead of html
[07:36:47] <slax0r> ah, works with html as well
[07:37:05] <slax0r> just, isnull is not a JS function, declare it or use var!=null in your if
[07:37:25] <jop008> THis is the latest one http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/108/
[07:37:59] <jop008> text same issue the formatting is gone
[07:38:37] <jop008> so how to refresh a collapsible content
[07:38:45] <Kambfhase> Cronoh: that is weird. can you show a demo?
[07:40:09] <slax0r> jop008, I see what you mean
[07:40:17] <slax0r> $('#typedescr .ui-btn-text').html ( "Verhuur " + cdescr); instead of your var.html(.....)
[07:41:31] <jop008> okay
[07:42:29] <slax0r> and next time, inspect element :P
[07:43:10] <jop008> fiddle works fine with this but my code not
[07:43:25] <slax0r> check console for errors
[07:43:59] <slax0r> and doesn't work as in, it doesn't replace text or it replaces it and loses formating?
[07:44:16] <anew> when looping thru php, i can specify the column i want to loop thru out of my results.  how do i do that with each() tho ?
[07:44:31] <Cronoh> WOW
[07:44:35] <Cronoh> foudn ti out im stupid
[07:45:02] <Kambfhase> Cronoh: I know that feeling :/
[07:45:29] <slax0r> I think every developer knows that feeling...
[07:45:35] <Cronoh> had 2 fields with the matching ID selector, and .text() was returning 99.0099  where 99 was the second text input at the end
[07:45:44] <Cronoh> i was like wtf javascript

[07:46:49] <anew> so with ajax if i return a table
[07:47:00] <anew> and in the table is id/city
[07:47:00] <Cork> anew: are you talking about a two dimensional array
[07:47:06] <anew> i want to use .each() and only print the city
[07:47:12] <anew> but inside the object i see id and city
[07:47:43] <Cork> anew: you mean you actually have id/city in a string?
[07:47:59] <anew> hmmm
[07:48:27] <slax0r> ajax call to a php script which returns a table?
[07:48:43] <Cork> think he talks about a database table
[07:48:49] <anew> with my backend i am returning the entire db table yes
[07:49:00] <Cork> anew: in what way?
[07:49:01] <slax0r> encode the table as json
[07:49:01] <Cork> json?
[07:49:10] <anew> yes it is now encoded as json
[07:49:11] <slax0r> and you can then access data as objects in JS
[07:49:23] <Cork> anew: and the structure is array with objects?
[07:49:29] <anew> let me pastbin what i have returned
[07:50:48] <anew> http://pastebin.com/Ln5rJmYr
[07:50:50] <anew> from my console
[07:51:09] <Cork> uh
[07:51:22] <anew> united states is column country
[07:51:31] <Cork> anew: that doesn't really say much
[07:51:34] <anew> abilene column state
[07:51:37] <anew> akron column city
[07:51:42] <anew> i only want to print all city columns
[07:51:55] <Cork> so you send each column as it's own object, instead of grouping it per row?
[07:52:38] <Cork> anew: normally it would be something like $.each(data, function(row) { row.city });
[07:52:45] <Cork> where data is the table
[07:52:51] <anew> i see
[07:52:54] <anew> ok let me work with that
[07:52:59] <Cork> not sure how you choose to structure it
[07:53:00] <anew> thx cork
[07:57:16] <anli> I am writing two functions with $.fn.extend({func1:function(){}, func2: function(){}});, now I want both of them to use a helper function not visible to the outside scope, is that possible?
[07:59:22] <Cork> anli: sure just have it all in a scope
[07:59:55] <Cork> (function($) {  function private() {}; $.fn.extend(): })(jQuery);
[07:59:57] <anli> ah, true, I can have the call to extend inside $(function(){}
[08:00:16] <anli> );
[08:00:19] <Cork> anli: no that would be delayed with ready you don't want that
[08:00:31] <anli> Not a big deal actually
[08:00:45] <anli> But I did not know that
[08:00:47] <anli> So it was useful
[08:00:56] <anli> Meaning that I never have to wait for ready?
[08:01:00] <Cork> anli: when you write a plugin you should always have it wrapped in (function($){})(jQuery)
[08:01:21] <Cork> anli: the creation of functions shouldn't wait for it
[08:01:39] <Cork> you might want to run $(function() {}) for sections but that's another matter
[08:01:40] <anli> thats cool
[08:01:59] <anli> extend is working immediately however, right?
[08:02:15] <Cork> if you don't wrap it in $(function() {})
[08:03:50] <anli> Wow, how I have started to appreciate js when I learned jQuery
[08:07:19] <Tingle> the html generated with the $('#container').html() function, does that recreate the html inside the #container element, or including the #container?
[08:07:34] <anli> excluding
[08:07:48] <Tingle> so only the inside of the div tag
[08:07:52] <anli> sure
[08:08:11] <Tingle> mm then my code isnt working
[08:10:28] <ddssc> when calling jq ui dialog multiple times for different functions I use $("#dlg_edit").prop("title", "Specific title"); . however the title stays the same and is the first one I called ie. it doesn't change with each subsequent .dialog() call
[08:11:03] <ddssc> is there a way to do a "refresh" of diaog props so .prop("title",) becomes effective ?
[08:11:31] <Tingle> I have #container, which is <div id="container"></div>, and I am trying to change the inside of that by doing: http://hastebin.com/qirabikavi.css , and inside the php file I have a simple echo("textext");
[08:12:07] <AngularJsSucks> folks...how can I pass a dummy Event object to the triggerHandler function?
[08:12:09] <yannickoo> hey guys, how can i execute $(document).ready() again after i replaced an html element? i'm using always .on()
[08:12:12] <Tingle> ah nvm
[08:12:16] <Tingle> typo wtf >.>
[08:14:47] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: you don't, you use 'event delegation' and have your 'on()' on a parent element that is always in the document
[08:15:09] <yannickoo> NoiseEee: is there a way to re-execute the document.ready stuff?
[08:15:27] <Tingle> ah damn, but stillnot working, Im trying to refresh a reCaptcha, and the recaptcha_get_html uses document.write which does not work with ajax due to it being asynchronous - hence the error: A call to document.write() from an asynchronously-loaded external script was ignored
[08:15:32] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: take it out of document.ready, put it in a function, and call said function whenever you like?
[08:15:45] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: but codesmell at this point really
[08:16:00] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: do you know what event delegation is?
[08:16:18] <yannickoo> NoiseEee: sure but just was confused why the .on() events won't trigger
[08:16:27] <Tingle> any way how to handle this?
[08:17:32] <AngularJsSucks> can anyone assist plz?
[08:18:10] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: wont trigger when you replace the html that has the .on()  ?  answer: use event delegation, don't call "document.ready" stuff twice
[08:18:21] <yannickoo> NoiseEee++
[08:24:07] <mink> AngularJsSucks, sorry, can you help me with angular? :)
[08:24:20] <AngularJsSucks> what u need?
[08:24:32] <tojochacko> hi
[08:24:36] <tojochacko> I am creating a dynamic div in my DOM and i can call $('mynewlycreateddiv').dialog() from my script. But after I do a $('mynewlycreateddiv').html() somehow $('mynewlycreateddiv').dialog() does not work. I changed my implementation from .html() to innerHTML and dialog widget started working again.
[08:25:10] <tojochacko> i wanted to know what does .html do internally to make dialog widget non-functional
[08:25:23] <mink> I really, really dont know why directives not work for me. It's basic function of angular, and It's not work lol. Without any errors, code like that -->   http://jsfiddle.net/uAwJG/60/
[08:25:24] <tojochacko> can soneone please help me with this ?
[08:28:35] <shoky> `demo @ tojochacko
[08:28:35] <b-ot> tojochacko: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:30:00] <tojochacko> b-ot: i m creating one now.
[08:36:14] <AngularJsSucks> mink: why u said it doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/uAwJG/60/
[08:44:31] <inthl> having a div with <script>-code within it, say e.g.: <div><script> ... </script></div> ...how do I select that current div to do something with it? $(this).something() as such does not work since this is not within a function
[08:47:43] <mad_mode_on> so is jQuery just a wrapper for Javascript? I open the code and saw this docElem = document.documentElement
[08:48:09] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: its a collection of javascript methods meant to make deploying code quicker and easier, and act the same regardless of browser
[08:48:41] <mad_mode_on> NoiseEee: so it simplifies the usage of Javascript ?
[08:49:00] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: i would say so
[08:49:16] <mad_mode_on> does it change "document.getElementById" by say "elem" ?
[08:50:20] <mad_mode_on> NoiseEee: how hasn't anybody thought of it before ?
[08:50:29] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: i'm not sure what your question is.
[08:50:45] <NoiseEee> basically, you don't use doc.gEBI, you'd use  $('#theID')
[08:51:00] <NoiseEee> and you'd be returned a jquery object on which you can call a whole bunch of handy methods
[08:51:17] <talntid> he's basically complaining about the length of the function
[08:51:26] <mad_mode_on> I meant: jQuery is raw Javascript after all, right ?
[08:51:36] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: yes it is
[08:52:03] <mad_mode_on> but it sistematically uses anonymous functions, right ?
[08:52:34] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: not necessarily, thats mostly irrelevant.  http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[08:53:09] <NoiseEee> its a highly tested, cross-browser framework for creating and deploying JS apps / enabled websites
[08:54:56] <NoiseEee> http://jqfundamentals.com/ still offers nice explanations even though its outdated a bit / replaced by the link i pasted previously
[08:57:26] <mink> AngularJsSucks, yes, It work on jsfiddle, not working in my app with the same code. Angular not return any error for that
[08:58:25] <NoiseEee> mink: check in the angular irc channel?
[09:01:32] <mad_mode_on> So we all know of the existence of many JS libs. But I assume all they are purpouse specific. Is there any other general JS lib like jQuery ?
[09:03:45] <driador> morning all... how do I call a function from a child window that's defined in the parent?
[09:03:59] <doug65536> driador: you don't
[09:04:10] <mad_mode_on> driador: morning's ended like 5 minutes ago :))
[09:04:25] <talntid> maybe for you :)
[09:04:31] <talntid> it's 9:05AM here
[09:04:39] <mad_mode_on> I know. Just joking
[09:04:54] <doug65536> driador: the closest you can come to that is postMessage API, and I'm not sure if that would even work from one window to another
[09:04:56] <talntid> bwwahahahaha
[09:04:58] <talntid> :-)
[09:05:00] <mad_mode_on> talnid: you're probably on the west coast
[09:05:15] <mad_mode_on> talntid: you're probably on the west coast
[09:05:16] <talntid> about 600 miles from coast
[09:05:39] <remybach1> I'm sure you can do it with `parent.window.functionName()`, no?
[09:05:41] <remybach1> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.parent
[09:05:46] <driador> so there's no way to go about it then?
[09:06:16] <driador> parent.document.foo() throws an error about 'object doesn't support property or method'
[09:06:27] <driador> (have to code for IE here unfortunately)
[09:06:49] <talntid> thats not unfortunate... IE rocks
[09:07:01] <doug65536> driador: I've screwed with that sort of stuff. you can do almost nothing across windows afaik
[09:07:18] <talntid> websockets! :-)
[09:08:16] <shoky> driador: don't put the "document" in there
[09:08:27] <doug65536> driador: you're lucky if you can even access global variables across windows, let alone being able to call functions across windows. I'm not sure, but I would be surprised
[09:08:32] <doug65536> driador: what are you trying to do?
[09:08:54] <shoky> doug65536: you can call parent functions easily with 'parent' if it's on the same domain.. no?
[09:09:17] <doug65536> shoky: in theory yes. in practice I could hardly get chrome to do anything
[09:09:29] <shoky> i could
[09:09:33] <doug65536> shoky: what
[09:09:41] <shoky> lemme try to jsbin it..
[09:09:59] <doug65536> shoky: the closest I could get to touching another window was childwindow.document.write('stuff')
[09:10:05] <driador> we have a form that (overall) comprises two windows, one being opened from the other.  The child window has an element that has an event bound to it which does a number of things to elements in it, but then also needs to call another function within the parent (to avoid duplicating code more or less)
[09:10:36] <doug65536> driador: use postMessage
[09:10:51] <driador> yea, parent.window.foo() still throws an error
[09:11:24] <shoky> parent.foo()
[09:11:52] <ptrin> Hey all, I'm using $.ajax with dataType script, and an absolute URL on the same domain. For some reason, the GET request that is made is not the same as the URL I provide in the $.ajax config. I have url: '/my/url/file.js', but the file requested is '/some/dir/my/url/file.js' which is a 404.
[09:12:01] <doug65536> shoky: in what browser?
[09:12:38] <remybach1> driador: are you sure the function is available globally in the parent window?
[09:12:42] <Xander1> hi
[09:12:47] <Xander1> anyone familiar with momentjs?
[09:12:56] <driador> remybach1: it should be, yes
[09:13:01] <Xander1> i need help with converting time in javascript
[09:13:08] <Xander1> 4:00 PM to 16:00:00
[09:13:10] <driador> shoky: that also fails :/
[09:13:16] <Xander1> whats the best way to do that?
[09:13:35] <doug65536> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zk492/33/   and    http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/y9By6/13/
[09:14:31] <driador> does postmessage work in IE7?  (don't ask...)
[09:14:50] <doug65536> driador: nothing works in IE7 :P
[09:15:04] <driador> doug65536: agreed... but that's what I have to work with
[09:15:17] <driador> at least, not until a few releases from now
[09:15:43] <shoky> ah it's opener.foo()
[09:16:17] <doug65536> shoky: yes but test it. it doesn't work
[09:16:33] <shoky> http://jsbin.com/OLazoWE/2/edit
[09:17:35] <driador> yea, opener.foo() when using compatibility views, but fails with a DOM error otherwise
[09:17:58] <driador> er, opener.foo() works even
[09:18:33] <doug65536> shoky: any theories on why the ones I showed you don't work at all?
[09:18:45] <doug65536> shoky: except the child.document.write
[09:19:06] <shoky> doug65536 you opened the wrong url, for starters
[09:19:23] <doug65536> shoky: what's wrong with the url?
[09:20:07] <shoky> you opened the full fiddle editor url
[09:20:09] <doug65536> shoky: I don't want to open up jsfiddle editor! adding /show/ gives you just the actual page output
[09:20:20] <doug65536> shoky: no, look at the url. it has /show/ on the end
[09:20:32] <shoky> should be http://fiddle.jshell.net/doug65536/y9By6/13/show/
[09:20:41] <shoky> well
[09:20:57] <Xander1> how can i convert 5:00 PM to 17:00:00
[09:20:58] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/y9By6/13/show/   <-- works for me
[09:21:42] <shoky> well, it depends where you're running the parent from, i guess
[09:21:47] <shoky> in a frame or not
[09:21:59] <shoky> in the frame it's on fiddle.jshell.net
[09:22:07] <doug65536> shoky: ah, so it's cross domain and browser blocks everything?
[09:22:26] <doug65536> shoky: damn it that was probably it
[09:23:46] <shoky> also..
[09:23:48] <vladikoff> shama, people are freaking out about the dependencies heh
[09:24:08] <vladikoff> shama, they should just `npm install` it
[09:24:59] <doug65536> shoky: yep, I made it a relative url with only the path and now the windows can write to eachother...
[09:25:40] <shoky> scratch the "also.."  your document.write confuzzled me ;p
[09:25:51] <fonko> guys does any one knows this plugin for count down? http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[09:26:09] <doug65536> shoky: jsfiddle gets pissy if you use document.write so I tricked it :D
[09:26:13] <fonko> i need to show a zero when days are less than 10 because it's needed by the layout
[09:26:45] <fonko> but i cant find (with the compact set tu true) how to accomplish that
[09:28:39] <driador> ok, ends up we're going to write another small stub js that has these functions in them and then both pages can use that file
[09:28:58] <driador> seems like that's the better option
[09:29:52] <driador> thanks all for the suggestions
[09:32:36] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I'm working on an slider with thumbnails using the function delegate to modify the main image when clicking on a thumb by giving the same name that the thumb to the main image and replacing "thumb" for "main". It replaces the names properly, but the main images keep displaying only the first main image
[09:32:59] <^^jfc^^> any idea what can be wrong?
[09:33:00] <^^jfc^^> thanks
[09:40:54] <Kambfhase> ?demo @ ^^jfc^^
[09:41:49] <doug65536> ^^jfc^^: I think I know what's wrong, based on the provided information: there's a bug
[09:42:45] <^^jfc^^> sure, I'm applying this structure: http://workshop.rs/2010/07/create-image-gallery-in-4-lines-of-jquery/
[09:45:58] <doug65536> ^^jfc^^: ok, I know what's wrong now. you did it wrong
[09:46:14] <doug65536> ^^jfc^^: some reason you're not showing your actual code?
[09:46:48] <^^jfc^^> sorry. 2 secs
[09:52:05] <^^jfc^^> Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/pzFk9/
[09:54:52] <^^jfc^^> sorry about the images, but I have no way to upload them to a server right now
[09:56:19] <Bloomberg> Afternoon guys!!
[09:56:58] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I hide only the bar for navigate up and down but I need too that works the mouse scroll
[10:08:30] <^^jfc^^> sorry doug65536, any bug was the problem, I AM THE BUG hahaha, as I just cleared the cache and the images were displayed properly
[10:08:31] <^^jfc^^> :D
[10:09:32] <doug65536> ^^jfc^^: if you shift+click refresh, it will pretend the cache is cleared for that load - might save you some effort next time
[10:09:57] <^^jfc^^> hahah
[10:09:58] <^^jfc^^> yes mate
[10:10:05] <^^jfc^^> thx anyway
[10:10:05] <^^jfc^^> :)
[10:10:47] <doug65536> Bloomberg: the bar?
[10:17:18] <sam-lap> hi guys, its possible to read a file with jquery ?
[10:17:36] <sam-lap> for example i've this test.html and test.txt
[10:17:53] <sam-lap> when i open test.html i want to see the content of test.txt
[10:19:19] <defaultro> hey guys, do you know of any graph plugins?
[10:19:32] <NoiseEee> sam-lap: no
[10:19:47] <NoiseEee> sam-lap: if test.txt was on the client machine and they chose it via <input type='file'> then yes
[10:20:22] <sam-lap> im running it locally
[10:20:37] <xnotte> anyone works with full-calendar ?
[10:21:04] <sam-lap> i've a program that store some info into a txt
[10:21:10] <NoiseEee> sam-lap: you cannot read a file without choosing the user/you selecting it via <input>
[10:21:40] <NoiseEee> sam-lap: otherwise, readYourFile(/etc/passwd) ya know?   or (c:\my documents\bankInfo.txt)
[10:21:53] <sam-lap> yeah i see
[10:22:14] <xnotte> my slottime its 15min, i want to add my events 3 slots of 15 after the selected cell (startdate)
[10:29:07] <tojochacko> b-ot: I think there is problem with the html content, i am trying to write in my dom element and hence dialog is not working using .html() function..
[10:30:34] <tojochacko> b-ot:becoz in jsfiddle, with .html() dialog widget worked as expected. Thanks for asking me to create a demo on jsfiddle or I would have blamed jquery for this :)
[10:33:03] <majuscule> Is there a jquery implementation of Function.prototype.bind ?
[10:39:37] <CthdrlComputer> Hey...I'm returning a json response to an ajax call (inside Laravel 4), how can I parse out the message inside of the data response? http://paste.laravel.com/Mfc is my code
[10:53:56] <redondo> what is the difference between 'var foo' and 'var $foo'?
[10:54:31] <Jayflux> hey guys, I have like 20 ajax requests going off and want to run a .done, can i pass an array of ajax objects into $.when
[10:57:00] <ringo_> redondo: none
[10:57:28] <ringo_> $ is for your enjoyment
[10:58:06] <redondo> ringo_, thanks, nothing more about prepeding '$'?
[10:58:15] <jhoffmcd> I need a tip on how to debug a slider that throws no errors or warnings but stops at the second slide... :/
[10:59:15] <ringo_> well, don't get it confused with jquery namespace '$'
[10:59:38] <ringo_> you can just use it to clarify that it's a variable
[10:59:49] <ringo_> i almost never feel the need to use it
[11:00:23] <redondo> ringo_, ok, thanks.
[11:28:56] <smallfoot> wow, I actually found a use for .wrap() and .unwrap() :)
[12:01:10] <anew> i cant figure out how to use append with each
[12:01:15] <anew> to loop thru results and append to html
[12:02:11] <anew> data = $().each(); and then $().append(data);
[12:02:12] <anew> ?
[12:04:04] <bradbrad> Guys, going nuts trying to figure this out! Why oh why am i getting a 503 error in inspector for this file (that DOESNOT exist) GET http://elimspaproducts.com/sites/all/themes/elim1/jquery.min.map 503 (Service Unavailable) ? heres the site http://elimspaproducts.com/home
[12:13:42] <Xander1> hi everyone
[12:14:19] <ProgrammingNik> hi
[12:14:50] <Xander1> anyone work with jQuery Timepicker Add-on - https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon and jEditable - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable ?
[12:15:23] <Xander1> i've combined both of those plugins but now having a small issue with altField option not receiving proper format
[12:19:06] <ProgrammingNik> Is it possible to prevent users from scrolling using jquery, without hiding the scroll bar completely? So that when they click the scrollbar nothing happens.
[12:19:27] <tw2113> why would you want to do a thing like that
[12:19:31] <tw2113> people are fine with the fold
[12:21:06] <ProgrammingNik> tw2113: Because i wanna create my own alert box, and therefore prevent the user from clicking on links or scrolling on the page.
[12:22:26] <tw2113> i wonder if you could use event.preventDefault() with scroll
[12:22:38] <tw2113> a high z-index div would cover all the links
[12:22:41] <ringo_> if you create the alert box as a modal window with an overlay behind it, that should prevent interaction with the page
[12:23:59] <ProgrammingNik> tw2113: I have already tried using event.preventDefault(), but it didn't work.
[12:25:10] <ringo_> you can make the overlay transparent
[12:26:19] <ProgrammingNik> ringo_: i have done something similar.
[12:26:41] <ringo_> i dont' think you can defeat scrollbar
[12:26:53] <ringo_> think about it, how would that work
[12:27:08] <ringo_> people see a scrollbar and try to drag the handle, but it doesn't move?
[12:28:18] <ringo_> you might be able to hide the scrollbar by setting the document to overflow: hidden
[12:28:42] <ProgrammingNik> ringo_: That's what i have already
[12:29:32] <jhoffmcd> setInterval... erg, I cant get it to fire more than once
[12:32:15] <ringo_> jhoffmcd: can you paste it on jsfiddle or pastebin
[12:34:07] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: pretty much narrowed it down to this simple section of code: http://pastebin.com/b5WPxY58
[12:35:24] <jhoffmcd> I feel like thats right at least
[12:35:43] <ringo_> seems ok
[12:36:06] <bradbrad> Guys, can someone PLEASE tell me why the slider here http://elimspaproducts.com/ should doesnt work like the slider here http://drive.envato.tabvn.com/demo.php
[12:36:11] <ringo_> i assume you mean for 'timer' and 'obj_timer' to be different
[12:36:33] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: well timer is set from an attr on the slide
[12:36:34] <ringo_> wait, it's just setInterval()
[12:37:05] <ringo_> ok that seems fine
[12:37:14] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: I think something else is wonky
[12:37:37] <ringo_> did you try putting a console.log() inside the anonymous function
[12:37:47] <ringo_> are you seeing any errors in the console?
[12:38:02] <ringo_> there could be something bad inside that function you're calling
[12:38:05] <jhoffmcd> No errors or warning, log output shows it runs once and not again
[12:38:35] <jhoffmcd> the .nextSlide function has to be the culpri, right?!
[12:38:36] <ringo_> did you try taking out the function and just doing console.log() inside the anonymous function
[12:38:39] <jhoffmcd> culprit
[12:38:48] <jhoffmcd> no ill try
[12:39:46] <jhoffmcd> ah, works.
[12:39:59] <ringo_> what is nextSlide()?
[12:40:04] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: Thanks, now i know its def not setInterval. Its gotta be the nextSlide function
[12:40:21] <ringo_> you can set a breakpoint and step into the nextSlide() function
[12:40:47] <ringo_> if it's a slideshow plugin, it might be managing intervals
[12:40:51] <ringo_> like, deleting them
[12:41:58] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: I'm trying to deconstruct. Old developer did this. nextSlide() is relatively simple, but it calls changeSlide() and I think something is screwy there
[12:42:00] <ringo_> bradbrad: console error
[12:42:09] <ringo_> it says jquery.min.map is not found
[12:42:28] <bradbrad> ringo_ any idea what in the world that file is, or why its being called?
[12:42:47] <ringo_> you're asking me? it's your website :-)
[12:43:04] <ringo_> i would do a search forthat in your source
[12:43:14] <ringo_> or just google it
[12:43:26] <jhoffmcd> bradbrad: I just started gettin that same error today
[12:43:33] <jhoffmcd> chrome extension i think
[12:43:36] <ringo_> ohh
[12:44:12] <ringo_> oh it might not have anythingt o do with your website then
[12:44:19] <bradbrad> jhoffmcd wish I had known that earlier! Been trying to figure it out for hours!!!
[12:44:34] <bradbrad> ringo_ thanks, any idea why that slider wont work??
[12:44:58] <ringo_> jhoffmcd: the js must be either throwing an error or using clearInterval()
[12:45:05] <ringo_> i would search for clearInterval()
[12:45:28] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: clearInterval is called but only on click events
[12:45:43] <jhoffmcd> I thinks its the js, an id isnt being passed i think
[12:45:51] <jhoffmcd> Ill have to investigaet
[12:46:13] <ringo_> bradbrad: i don't see any slider on the page
[12:47:43] <bradbrad> yup, thats the problem. its the EXACT same slider as http://drive.envato.tabvn.com/demo.php (inspect in white blank area on elim and you will see the html, the js just wont happen for some reason).
[12:47:48] <bradbrad> ringo_^^
[12:51:45] <bradbrad_> Sorry got disconnected
[12:54:09] <anew> i'm always having issues with my js not loading
[12:54:13] <anew> and then the whole page is fucked
[12:54:17] <anew> how often does that happen to u guys ?
[12:54:27] <jhoffmcd> ringo_: yep, one of the slides was not passing the correct id of the slider.
[13:07:02] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[13:13:57] <hansnn> How would I go about accessing the class of this, and using it to access another element?
[13:15:20] <bmb> Having a problem with JQ 1.10.2 in IE8.  This code should log 'once' to the console exactly once, on the first scroll event, and then turn off -- which it does in other browsers, but not IE8.  The call to 'off' doesn't seem to work in IE8.  It prints 'once' forever, on every scroll event.  Happening on jQuery.com using a BrowserStack instance of IE8 on XP.
[13:15:23] <bmb> $(window).on('scroll', function fn() { console.log('once'); $(window).off('scroll', fn); });
[13:28:18] <forgot> how to show number in SI prefix but still sortable by datatables? i'd like to avoid hacking jQuery.fn.dataTableExt.oSort
[13:28:21] <devslash> how do i remove an item from a select by value?
[13:32:05] <charas> How can I hide twitter dropdown on clicking anywhere outside on page? Using bootstrap 3.
[13:32:26] <charas> Basically I wnat to hide the dropdown on iPad.
[13:32:42] <charas> Since on desktop it works based on hover so it's fine there
[13:33:25] <hansnn> Is it possible to access the class of 'this'? thanks
[13:44:04] <kamelkev> Is it possible to "fake" a standard form POST event and navigate to the page to display the results
[13:44:09] <kamelkev> like I do not have a form
[13:44:14] <kamelkev> but I want all the behaviors of a standard form post
[13:44:23] <snover> and what would those be
[13:44:51] <kamelkev> posting the form data and showing the url in the url bar
[13:44:57] <kamelkev> basically not a get request
[13:45:23] <kamelkev> like I want to fabricate a post version of GET http://www.example.com/form.rwp?firstname=bob
[13:45:40] <kamelkev> and the resulting display would show the results of that POST 200
[13:47:23] <kamelkev> or, a parallel question
[13:47:35] <kamelkev> is it possible to remove a specific input from a form submit
[13:47:39] <kamelkev> where post is used
[13:47:44] <kamelkev> so I have a form, I have firstname and lastname
[13:47:53] <kamelkev> I want to cherry pick out the lastname and prevent it from being submitted
[13:48:12] <kamelkev> I don't want to set the field to empty, because then that would affect my UI
[13:48:32] <j_wright> so handle submit?
[13:49:03] <kamelkev> basically handle the submit
[13:49:14] <kamelkev> but you want a synchronous submit event, not ajax
[13:49:27] <kamelkev> this is mostly a mental exercise, but I could not figure out a way to do it
[13:49:30] <kamelkev> but it should be possible
[13:51:19] <AlVal> how much should I expect to pay to get someone to solve this for me?
[13:51:20] <AlVal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18375362/simplest-way-to-grab-data-using-jquery-getjson-from-this-api-and-present-it-in-a
[13:52:22] <kamelkev> I strongly suggest you do not pay anyone nor offer a bounty
[13:52:30] <kamelkev> you need to understand how to do it, it's uber basic
[13:52:46] <kamelkev> über
[13:53:44] <AlVal> kamelkev: all the samples and examples I've seen of similar tasks aren't explained thoroughly enough for my needs
[13:53:47] <kamelkev> as an fyi
[13:53:53] <kamelkev> row = $('<tr></tr>'); // build a row
[13:53:56] <AlVal> the examples all assume an existing level of competence
[13:53:58] <kamelkev> that mgiht be wrong
[13:54:03] <kamelkev> you only need to put the open tag
[13:54:08] <kamelkev> to create the element using this syntax
[13:54:17] <kamelkev> you might be right though, I've just never read code that used that particular syntx
[13:54:36] <kamelkev> this particular syntax had problems with ie6 and ie7 for a while
[13:54:45] <kamelkev> it's not clear to me if that's fixed in the lastest jquery or not
[13:54:51] <AlVal> kamelkev: I really don't mind which way its approached, since I'm a real beginner, I'd ideally like to see it done in the most easy-to-read / understand way
[13:54:58] <AlVal> even if not technically the most efficient
[13:55:02] <pixelpimp> definitely fixed in 2.0 ;)
[13:55:07] <pixelpimp> (no IE6/7 support)
[13:55:15] <kamelkev> yeah I don't use 2.0 for that reason :(
[13:55:22] <pixelpimp> it's a great reason to use 2.0
[13:55:27] <kamelkev> not if you have customers
[13:55:36] <kamelkev> I can see what they are doing
[13:55:38] <kamelkev> there is a logic to it
[13:55:45] <kamelkev> just saying I cannot use 2.0, not realistic right now
[13:55:53] <pixelpimp> i have customers.  i charge an extremely insane rate for IE support because if you need it, you should be paying an extremely insane rate
[13:56:02] <kamelkev> yeah I cannot do that
[13:56:09] <kamelkev> I have about 2,000 customers
[13:56:15] <kamelkev> most use ie7
[13:56:21] <kamelkev> world of pain
[13:56:39] <kamelkev> We did finally stop supporting IE6, which helped a lot
[13:56:41] <pixelpimp> i work on mobile apps and modern sites
[13:56:48] <kamelkev> as do I
[13:57:05] <kamelkev> if you want to work with the government, banks or non profits
[13:57:11] <kamelkev> you need to plan on supporting older browsers
[13:57:13] <AlVal> maybe the standards need to be clearer ,so that there's no room for browsers to swing their own interpretations of standards
[13:57:19] <AlVal> just a thought..
[13:57:29] <kamelkev> AlVal: things are better than they ever were before
[13:57:44] <kamelkev> improvement across the board for standards compliance
[13:57:54] <pixelpimp> as a web developer, it's my job to explain to my customers why old IE support is bad
[13:57:56] <kamelkev> the next version of CKEditor actually cuts off IE7
[13:58:07] <kamelkev> which will force me to make some changes, which is fine
[13:58:14] <kamelkev> slowly we're getting there
[13:58:18] <kamelkev> I wish Google would abandon IE7
[13:58:26] <kamelkev> that was the way the government got off of it
[13:58:48] <kamelkev> Google announced it was deprecating IE6 and all of a sudden everyone across the board accepted it as ok
[13:58:55] <kamelkev> need another such move for IE7 to signal it's dead
[13:59:31] <AlVal> I worked in a private company supplying performance management software to UK councils, the web based solution used javascript heavily, and IE6 was still rife among the uk councils. I hear it still is
[14:00:42] <RocketCoindexter> I have a query function that triggers on hover,  I changed to trigger on .click
[14:00:48] <RocketCoindexter> but it is not working
[14:01:15] <RocketCoindexter> is there something special about .click that I am missing to not get a popup to slideDown
[14:01:16] <RocketCoindexter> ?
[14:01:52] <pixelpimp> probably not with the click, no.  but maybe with whatever you're using for your popup code
[14:02:14] <pixelpimp> but i'd think it'd work out of the box with the change
[14:02:55] <AlVal> kamelkev: can you give me a brief description of what fundamentally needs to be on a html page for my problem posted above to be solved? The fact I've showed my latest attempt may mislead you into thinking I have more javascript knowledge than I do - I was trying to amend similar examples I found on the net to work for my purpose
[14:03:24] <ariedler> I have an object foo of type [deferred[]]; how would I execute $.when() on it ?
[14:03:31] <RocketCoindexter> pixelpimp http://jsfiddle.net/55fGb/
[14:03:36] <kamelkev> I was saying that <tr></tr> probably is not right
[14:03:39] <kamelkev> you need <tr> only
[14:03:41] <kamelkev> to create a row element
[14:03:48] <kamelkev> that's the only thing I was saying
[14:04:00] <kamelkev> and RocketCoindexter has it right
[14:04:07] <kamelkev> post to jsfiddle and demonstrate your problems there
[14:04:12] <kamelkev> otherwise nobody is going to help you
[14:04:14] <kamelkev> it's too much work
[14:05:39] <RocketCoindexter> the query look correct?  When I had it as .hover it worked fine… as I hovered over the element the drop down would slide down
[14:05:49] <pixelpimp> RocketCoindexter: well it'll ignore that second block (with the slideUp), but that shouldn't matter...  looks alright to me
[14:06:18] <RocketCoindexter> hmmm…. ok, yea it looked fine to me… I can't figure why it isn't working
[14:06:31] <kamelkev> complete the fiddle
[14:06:37] <AlVal> kamelkev: that's why I suggested paying from the start.. I'm not near the assumed level of competence to start tackling it. getting working code that has every line well commented would be the best method for me..
[14:06:39] <kamelkev> I can't tell what the hell you are doing with just this snippet
[14:06:58] <kamelkev> AlVal: your problem is you don't know enough to even pay somebody right now
[14:07:02] <kamelkev> you need more knowledge
[14:07:08] <kamelkev> otherwise it's going to be the wrong solution or you overpay
[14:07:20] <kamelkev> but yeah, if you keep posting here somebody will do it
[14:07:29] <kamelkev> start offering bitcoins heh, that should do it
[14:07:54] <ariedler> $.when([$.ajax(...),$.ajax(...)]) <--- does this work as intended?
[14:08:54] <AlVal> can't really be a wrong solution as long as it returns the json as a reasonably legible html list
[14:10:55] <pr4xx> hey, someone good in selectors? :P
[14:12:05] <kamelkev> yes, very
[14:12:55] <pr4xx> i have a set of this <tr> element: http://pastebin.com/c6d9pc8y
[14:13:16] <pr4xx> i want the inner html of .hiddenspan when I click on .editworker
[14:13:39] <pr4xx> i tried .closest but it gave me undefined
[14:14:51] <kamelkev> 1 sec
[14:15:11] <kamelkev> do you have a rendering of this somewhere
[14:16:16] <pr4xx> a screenshot?
[14:16:26] <kamelkev> no, a web page somewhere with a rendering
[14:16:32] <kamelkev> I dont understand your whole editworker comment
[14:16:41] <kamelkev> you are discussing a browser interaction but you aren't displaying it at all
[14:16:44] <kamelkev> use jsfiddle.net
[14:16:47] <kamelkev> make it work
[14:16:48] <kamelkev> paste back
[14:17:04] <pr4xx> wait
[14:17:05] <kamelkev> you aren't even looking for a selector per se
[14:17:22] <kamelkev> you are looking for a way to reference an element which changes dynamically - or at least that's what you seem to be saying
[14:17:47] <ngharo> pr4xx: you may try $(this).closest('tr').find('.hiddenspan')
[14:18:24] <ngharo> since .hiddenspan isn't a parent of .editworker in your paste, you have to traverse up to a parent then back down to find hiddenspan
[14:18:27] <AlVal> http://jsfiddle.net/CsB7w/
[14:18:27] <pr4xx> wow, ngharo it works!
[14:18:30] <AlVal> am I getting closer?
[14:19:04] <pr4xx> thanks kamelkev and ngharo
[14:19:42] <kamelkev> 1 sec looking
[14:22:14] <ngharo> AlVal: more like this perhaps: http://jsfiddle.net/CsB7w/1/
[14:22:27] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[14:22:30] <ngharo> you need to use jsonp (&callback=?)
[14:22:54] <kamelkev> callback for jsonp
[14:22:54] <kamelkev> right
[14:23:03] <kamelkev> he only needs that for jsfiddle though
[14:23:10] <kamelkev> if this is hosted on your domain you can drop that
[14:23:52] <AlVal> why the div? habit? :D
[14:25:27] <AlVal> ngharo: thanks for the correction. I thought I'd found an example script that would simply return each element out of the json as html, even if not well formatted
[14:25:39] <kamelkev> more like $("<p>").text(field.resource).appendTo("#foo");
[14:25:43] <kamelkev> or I guess <div>
[14:25:46] <kamelkev> instead of just "div"
[14:25:53] <kamelkev> otherwise it's just going to replace the content there
[14:26:15] <kamelkev> what are you making
[14:26:19] <kamelkev> are you making this for yourself?
[14:27:31] <AlVal> kamelkev: god yes haha, I have a team of devs when it comes to commercial development! unfortunately I can't ask them to help me on this
[14:27:48] <kamelkev> what's the underlying api here
[14:27:51] <kamelkev> is this part of Plex?
[14:28:25] <AlVal> kamelkev: haha does it really matter.. I've provided sample format, and its the only thing I need returning from the api, it'll always be in that json format
[14:28:50] <kamelkev> I use plex at home and I saw the same file format that I download
[14:28:52] <kamelkev> just wondering
[14:28:59] <AlVal> ok. at the risk of getting lectured on tv show piracy, its "sickbeard"'s api
[14:29:14] <kamelkev> "fair use"
[14:29:16] <kamelkev> :)
[14:29:22] <kamelkev> so I pay for HBO
[14:29:31] <kamelkev> and I got a notice from comcast
[14:29:36] <kamelkev> who I pay for the HBO
[14:29:43] <kamelkev> that I was downloading game of thrones and had to stop immediately
[14:29:44] <kamelkev> and I was like
[14:29:47] <kamelkev> but I pay for this
[14:29:48] <AlVal> I wanted to make a simple html page to show the last 2 shows I downloaded
[14:29:53] <kamelkev> I don't get their logic
[14:29:57] <kamelkev> I pay to watch game of thrones
[14:30:01] <AlVal> weren't game of thrones the ones who actually said piracy wasn't hurting them?
[14:30:02] <kamelkev> can't I download it to watch it from my ipad?
[14:30:06] <kamelkev> yes
[14:30:12] <kamelkev> but that's neither here nor there
[14:30:43] <kamelkev> so comcast does that 6 strikes thing
[14:30:59] <kamelkev> and apparently I used up a lot of strikes on content that I am legally entitled to access
[14:31:06] <kamelkev> the whole thing is really silly
[14:31:19] <AlVal> I actually pretty much had what I needed achieved through simple bash scripting on the freebsd box, and grep through the logs to extract the data, then the sickbeard guys told me off for not using the api that they spent time developing
[14:31:31] <thang> are you downloading for an hd version / have you used hbogo.com ?
[14:31:41] <kamelkev> I can't use hbogo from a plane
[14:31:46] <thang> ahh fair
[14:31:46] <kamelkev> there isn't enough bandwidth
[14:31:48] <AlVal> yeah I was reading a post on reddit about "worst companies you have to deal with" and comcast was like #1 or 2
[14:32:06] <pixelpimp> anything with cable
[14:32:09] <kamelkev> I have never watched cable on my tv
[14:32:10] <ngharo> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/433/ I found updateComplete event that fires after updating a field
[14:32:12] <kamelkev> but I pay for it
[14:32:15] <kamelkev> and after I got the nasty emails
[14:32:18] <thang> what tracker? ive been downloading at two separate locations with comcast as the ISP and i havent been dinged yet
[14:32:20] <kamelkev> I was like I might as well cancel cable
[14:32:21] <AlVal> kamelkev: grab all the files hd, then use a transcoding streaming server to stream them to ipad at your chosen bandwidth
[14:32:26] <kamelkev> because I'm getting in trouble even though I pay for this
[14:32:36] <pixelpimp> we have mediacom cable here.  i would not be sad if some of the higher ups there were burned alive
[14:32:37] <kamelkev> like why do the right thing if I get in trouble anyway
[14:32:41] <kamelkev> might as well do the wrong thing
[14:32:49] <kamelkev> I was using the pirate bay
[14:32:57] <thang> private trackers
[14:32:58] <AlVal> I use serviio/mediabrowser, so at home files are full hd, but on the road can stream to mobile device at any rate I like
[14:33:09] <kamelkev> yeah Plex can do that too
[14:33:16] <kamelkev> the problem with the plane is latency
[14:33:21] <kamelkev> it's not necessarily bandwidth
[14:33:24] <kamelkev> you can lose a connection for 30 seconds
[14:33:31] <AlVal> I steer clear of peer to peer myself, and stick with usenet, I feel it's better as I'm not providing the data to anyone else, just pure downloading
[14:33:31] <kamelkev> you really need the file local
[14:33:59] <kamelkev> The irony is that rather than encouraging a paying customer to continue paying, they are discouraging me
[14:34:09] <kamelkev> a better use of my money would probably be a canadian VPN
[14:34:16] <kamelkev> I won't do that, but it's just things to think about
[14:34:33] <AlVal> kamelkev: yeah, kevin spacey just made a big speech about how tv companies etc need to give users stuff the way they want it etc
[14:34:41] <thang> reminds me of this: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones
[14:35:09] <AlVal> give people what they want, and the vast vast majority will happily pay a reasonable price
[14:38:30] <AlVal> bah, irc client crapped out. don't suppose I missed any advice on getting the json formatted out as html?
[14:39:08] <Trudko> ngharo: thx
[14:39:56] <ngharo> AlVal: use a template or if you dont care about being very readable you can JSON.stringify(field)
[14:41:22] <jhoffmcd> I have 10 slides that are used in a setInterval function. My second slide gets skipped, any strange issues like this?
[14:45:09] <Dieterbe> hi i have a problem with http://api.jquery.com/load/ , i have 9 load() calls that gets some html content that has js code init. i can see in firefox net tab that all requests return the proper html with embedded js
[14:45:25] <kamelkev> $('<form action="url" method="POST">').append('<input>').submit();
[14:45:30] <kamelkev> can something like that actually work?
[14:45:36] <kamelkev> like a virtual form submit
[14:45:38] <Dieterbe> but only the first 5 seem to actually execute the js, the others don't. when i inspect the html contents from the DOM it seems the javascript somehow disappeared? how is that possible?
[14:45:48] <kamelkev> I get no error, but I also do not see a post either
[14:46:09] <ngharo> Dieterbe: jquery evals() contents of <script> tags in requests and doesn't write them to the DOM
[14:46:34] <ngharo> Dieterbe: it's kinda a crummy way to do things, instead put the javascript in your callbacks
[14:46:45] <ngharo> and only fetch html
[14:48:29] <kamelkev> this is really strange this doesn't work
[14:48:33] <Dieterbe> aww :[
[14:49:35] <kamelkev> oh I wasn't saying your thing doesn't or whatever
[14:49:43] <kamelkev> I was saying a virtual form does not appear to work for some reason
[14:49:54] <kamelkev> a form implemented entirely as jquery cannot submit
[14:50:01] <kamelkev> no errors, no results
[14:50:55] <kamelkev> maybe it needs to be bound to the dom
[14:51:26] <Dieterbe> ngharo: it's weird though that for the first 5 times the eval thing works, and then not anymore
[14:52:18] <kamelkev> yup, that can work
[14:52:29] <kamelkev> a form may not be submitted if it is not attached to the dom
[14:52:32] <kamelkev> that is a little weird to me
[14:53:13] <ngharo> Dieterbe: are you watching the console? script errors?
[14:54:05] <Dieterbe> i checked, no errors
[14:55:06] <ekarlso-> question: for CORS is it standard to allow OPTIONS without auth in a API server ?
[14:57:53] <SpNg> any suggestions for a good javascript scrollbar?
[15:01:57] <kamelkev> CORS requires OPTIONS to work
[15:02:13] <kamelkev> ekarlso-: if you read through the spec, OPTIONS HTTP request is used to implement CORS
[15:02:19] <ekarlso-> kamelkev: that's not what I wonder about...
[15:02:36] <ekarlso-> kamelkev: more like is it standard to allow OPTIONS without authorization ?
[15:02:41] <kamelkev> yes
[15:02:45] <kamelkev> many apis do not require auth
[15:02:59] <kamelkev> and typically CORS would occur before auth
[15:03:03] <kamelkev> let's say you had an API key
[15:03:09] <kamelkev> and you want to send that as part of your cross domain request
[15:03:22] <kamelkev> you cannot authenticate before performing the cross domain request, as you have no communications channel yet
[15:03:37] <kamelkev> so first comes CORS OPTIONS, then comes auth
[15:04:01] <kamelkev> now if you had simple http auth, my bet is that should occur after CORS OPTIONS too
[15:05:06] <ekarlso-> anyone else got suggestions on this?
[15:11:24] <kamelkev> are you having a problem? suggestion for what exactyl
[15:11:30] <kamelkev> or are you just looking for opinions about it
[15:16:13] <Ty_> Hey guys I need a little help. I'm trying to make a site where the main "frame" will load pages within the main frame. I've used ajax to load data into a smaller frame. I want to make it so I can refresh the page and it will automatically reload last page loaded in the smaller frame.
[15:20:57] <kamelkev> what are the frames
[15:21:04] <kamelkev> are they actual ... <frames>
[15:21:35] <kamelkev> do you have access to cookies
[15:23:22] <cip> Hello
[15:23:46] <cip> any jquery expert here that could help me with some form validation?
[15:26:56] <cip> well ill say my problem then
[15:27:05] <cip> maybe someone has an idea on what to do
[15:27:11] <cip> so i am using this form: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/jquery-multi-step-form-with-progress-bar
[15:27:24] <cip> and i am trying to implement some form validation with jquery
[15:27:39] <cip> (forms are already validated server side with php)
[15:27:53] <cip> but i want to use jquery so that the user cant go to the next step of the form
[15:28:03] <cip> if he dosnt complete the fields
[15:29:17] <cip> umm anyone there?
[15:31:56] <cip> anyone there I could ask some questions related to jquery validation?
[15:33:04] <petey> Anyone have any experience with http://responsiveslides.com ?
[15:34:01] <Guest6958> hey i have a list of items and when list item is clicked it loads sidescreen, can i do something where if url has domain.com#name it will activate the name labeled item??
[15:36:27] <Guest6958> not even sure where to start looking
[15:57:01] <spillere> in this page, http://www.darkglass.com/contact/ when i send an email, i hide a div and show another one, but while they are changing, the second div gets misplaced. any idea on how i can fix that?
[16:01:48] <kamelkev> you are probably referencing an element that is changing
[16:01:52] <kamelkev> reference a static element
[16:01:56] <kamelkev> within this context
[16:01:59] <kamelkev> a parent element for example
[16:02:11] <kamelkev> so if you added a wrapping div around the 2 divs in question
[16:02:16] <kamelkev> then you can hide the one while revealing the other
[16:02:22] <kamelkev> and their position will remain fixed
[16:04:39] <spillere> kamelkev: thanks
[16:21:23] <jhoffmcd> anybody experience problems with jquery animate and setInterval()?
[16:51:11] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I'm trying to get the width of each li element within an ul and set the parent ul width. But it not working at all, I'm doing something stupid, becase when going through an each or map, it doesn't seem to be keep the functions of a jquery element.
[16:51:13] <rgoytacaz> https://gist.github.com/rgoytacaz/6a81a5a1193732ff60ed
[16:54:24] <heshanh> on the datepicker how do i disable all dates before the currentdate +2 days
[16:56:00] <samholmes> How do I turn a jquery object into a HTML string I can plop into a textarea?
[17:01:37] <SteveBenner9> rgoytacaz: 5 scs and I have your answer
[17:03:07] <rgoytacaz> SteveBenner9: Thank you, stil reading the docs. Because each or map seems to return something else other than a jQuery object for those elements.
[17:03:19] <rgoytacaz>  /stil/still/g
[17:04:52] <rgoytacaz> SteveBenner9: seems like I need to use outerWidth(true) there, but still the same problem regarding the jQuery object.
[17:05:06] <SteveBenner9> there are 2 map functions
[17:05:55] <SteveBenner9> jquery can be confusing because the jQuery.* or $.* syntax is not a function called on a jQuery object, it's called on the base jQuery 'master' object which is not an HTML element like you would think, it holds 'util' funcitons and such
[17:06:14] <SteveBenner9> also,  you need to use $(this) in functions where you want access to the current jQuery object
[17:13:56] <rgoytacaz> SteveBenner9: Yea, I saw that I missed jQuery(this)
[17:14:05] <rgoytacaz> I've fixed that in the gist.
[17:18:58] <SteveBenner9> https://gist.github.com/rgoytacaz/6a81a5a1193732ff60ed/#comment-896239
[17:21:30] <SteveBenner9> hey rgoytacaz: google 'github markdown' its awesome. You can use the ` syntax to place code in your comments and such
[17:56:10] <altoid> i imagine plugins aren't officially supported in this channel, but is there anyone here who has any ideas why jquery-cookie works fine in desktop browsers with user agent overrides, but not on mobile?
[18:55:15] <Guest6958> hey guys i'm trying to simulate position:fixed, but no effect, I just put this straight footer is there anything wrong http://pastebin.com/8dFDbW8a
[18:58:25] <nesoi> in jquery mobile, I have a fixed header and footer, but sometimes when I update the scrolling content area, the footer ends up off the bottom of the screen. how could I prevent that from happening?
[19:01:20] <da-beginner> hello, i have a question: how do i force jquery to redraw when i click refresh? at the moment i need to click shift refresh before it redraws it .. and i cant rely on the visitors to do the same
[19:02:02] <da-beginner> it is causing a problem on my page because whilst the element has been refreshed, the jquery ui label seems to still draw the old state
[19:05:37] <da-beginner> any takers?
[19:05:37] <banshee__> use on()
[19:06:22] <da-beginner> banshee__: is that for me? how do i use on() for jquery ui?
[19:07:08] <banshee__> what you want to do?
[19:07:10] <banshee__> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:07:33] <banshee__> redraw? You call an event and state doesn't change?
[19:07:45] <da-beginner> banshee__: it is not a state, it is a page refresh
[19:08:06] <banshee__> oh sry. you want to refresh the page and then what?
[19:08:29] <da-beginner> banshee__: so when we change the state from the backend and we refresh the page (clicking F5) the native elements changed accordingly.. however the jqueryui still draws the old state
[19:08:43] <banshee__> ok
[19:09:09] <da-beginner> i can see the elements picking up the new values (in this case, the button is being enabled again), but the jqueryui still renders the disabled button
[19:09:17] <banshee__> is it a form that keeps the old state?
[19:09:28] <banshee__> autocomplete=off
[19:09:53] <Guest6958> guys can someone help me understand why this isn't working http://pastebin.com/8dFDbW8a??
[19:12:00] <banshee__> add timestamp to you js file or send headers with expire?
[19:15:41] <Ericx2x> anyone know how to make a lightbox?
[19:17:11] <da-beginner> banshee__: thanks.. i'll look into the header expire... cos the autocomplete works but we do want to remember the state for the other form elements
[19:20:41] <da-beginner> banshee__: or can i only turn off autocomplete on one element only?
[19:27:21] <__machine> does jquery provide anything useful to prevent xss attacks? or is it all down to using jquery and js safely (not trusting, and escaping, user input)?
[19:28:55] <doug65536> __machine: jquery provides ways to set page content that is escaped for you
[19:29:34] <__machine> what section of the docs should i look to for more information about jquery and xss protection?
[19:30:49] <doug65536> __machine: avoid using .html unless you are sure the content is safe, and when you don't know it is safe, use .text
[19:31:41] <doug65536> __machine: there is little reason to use .html anyway, jquery provides ways to construct page content from objects
[19:33:15] <__machine> doug65536: so text(...) is like html(...) except it escapes input... is there also another method to escape arbitrary strings, e.g. that might be used as or combined with a selector?
[19:33:53] <doug65536> __machine: look at creating things safely, such as $('<div>').append($('<a>').attr('href', url).text(some_unsafe_text))
[19:34:17] <doug65536> __machine: yes, .text escapes for you
[19:34:28] <doug65536> __machine: .attr is also a way to safely set attribute values
[19:35:15] <awc737> is it possible to $('#facebook-iframe').click();
[19:35:23] <juboba> Hey, how can I prevent the effect to occur if I quickly hover in and out? I would like to use .animate() http://jsfiddle.net/NKC2j/4/
[19:37:24] <doug65536> __machine: if the attacker has a way to affect the href attribute, they could craft something like "></a><script...
[19:39:56] <doug65536> __machine: if you use .attr, jquery will make it href="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script..."  and it won't escape the href attribute
[19:40:05] <__machine> doug65536: thanks
[19:55:41] <doug65536> awc737: I doubt it, did you try it?
[19:57:17] <awc737> doug65536, yeah
[19:57:33] <awc737> $('#facebook-iframe').click().then(function($('#twitter-follow').click()).then(function($('#google-plus').click()... etc
[19:57:46] <doug65536> awc737: what are you trying to do? there might be a proper way to do it
[19:57:50] <awc737> I just want to PWN THE SH!!t! out of anyone who vists my site
[19:58:12] <awc737> if you visit my site you should automatically like me everywhere
[19:58:22] <awc737> like and follow and plus one all the things
[19:58:41] <doug65536> you don't think g+ and facebook and twitter have already thought about jerks like you?
[19:59:53] <awc737> hmm
[20:00:18] <awc737> it's my site though that's their fault for visiting my site
[20:00:33] <awc737> i don't want to hack or edit their behaviors on g+ / fb / twitter etc
[20:07:50] <erba> hey guys having trouble with script for an onscroll effect. Its not animating.. www.tameernyc.com the elements are not animating once they are in the viewport ...any ideas?
[20:09:48] <doug65536> erba: based on the information provided, I think I know what is wrong. there's a bug in your code

[20:10:38] <doug65536> what do you mean "onscroll effect"
[20:11:20] <erba> i mean the image and the paragraph on candy are supposed to slide in when u scroll down the homepage

[20:13:05] <skcin7> I'm using jQuery 2.0.2 and using the .on() method to attach an event handler to close a modal. The modal window will close the first time but if I open it up again it wont close the second time. I know this has something to do with event bubbling but I'm not sure what. Any ideas?

[20:59:12] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone help me with arrays?
[20:59:48] <j_wright> in jquery?
[21:01:00] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[21:01:22] <sheilablackrose> im getting a json encoded array
[21:01:29] <j_wright> as opposed to just javascript Arrays?
[21:01:41] <sheilablackrose> i mean i have the array but i need help manipulating it
[21:02:00] <j_wright> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[21:04:18] <sheilablackrose> thank  you
[22:57:57] <ekkis> ordinarily I could do: var x = $("<tr/>"); $("#mytab").append(x);
[22:58:39] <ekkis> but how would I do: var x = $("<tr/>"); x.append($("<tr/>")); when I mean to concatenate?
[23:01:16] <doug65536> ekkis: what do you mean by concatenate?
[23:01:24] <doug65536> ekkis: make an array of rows?
[23:01:48] <Cork> ?api add
[23:01:48] <b-ot> Cork: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[23:02:01] <Cork> doug65536: i commented on your bug
[23:02:35] <ekkis> well, in the first case I might do: $("#mytable").append(x); $("#mytable").append(y); etc.  but if I wanted to gather up all the objects into a single object and then do $("#mytable").append(all_rows); how would I put them togetherr?
[23:02:50] <ekkis> doug65536: can I hand .append() an array?
[23:02:52] <Cork> ekkis: see the link from b-ot
[23:02:58] <ekkis> oh...
[23:03:07] * ekkis looks
[23:03:23] <Cork> ekkis: you can't append to nothing, but you can add to the array in jquery
[23:03:33] <doug65536> Cork: thanks
[23:03:33] <Cork> ekkis: alternatively have a tbody and append to it
[23:04:13] <ekkis> Cork: that's why append is the wrong method and I'm hoping for something else... like (maybe) .add()
[23:04:28] <ekkis> what I don't want is to have to rely on some object on the page
[23:04:43] <ekkis> I want to create a bunch of objects and then append them in one sitting
[23:05:00] <ekkis> I'm not sure that .add() will fit thee bill....
[23:05:12] <Cork> ekkis: it will x = x.add('')
[23:05:34] <ekkis> but what is x to begin with?
[23:05:34] <Cork> ekkis: as you want to build a list of elements to append
[23:05:45] <Cork> ekkis: var x = $();
[23:06:05] <Cork> ekkis: alternatively you can do var x = []; x.push($('
[23:06:06] <ekkis> oh, so I could say: var x = $("<tr/>"); then x = x.add($("<tr/>");
[23:06:06] <Cork> opps
[23:06:16] <Cork> ekkis: alternatively you can do var x = []; x.push($('<tr/>')[0])
[23:06:23] <Cork> ekkis: yes
[23:06:36] <ekkis> awesome!
[23:06:38] <ekkis> thanks mate
[23:18:31] <the_cyber_guy> i am learning request signing. i would like to know how to serialize the json object data to generate hmac hash before sending to the server. and how to handle request signing in case of file uploads.
[23:20:27] <doug65536> the_cyber_guy: this library does HMAC http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/
[23:21:53] <the_cyber_guy> doug65536, i need the serialization part for json objects as well as file uploads. i am using Crypto-JS library for hashing and other encryptions.
[23:22:18] <doug65536> the_cyber_guy: $.encodeJSON ?
[23:24:00] <doug65536> the_cyber_guy: wait, I'm not sure that exists on second thought...
[23:24:26] <the_cyber_guy> doug65536, i am still not sure i have understood hmac signing or not. but i think json objects are needed to be urlencoded or something like that before generating hmac hash. suppose i have {message: "Hello"} as data now i need to generate hmac for this. how this can be done ?
[23:25:50] <doug65536> the_cyber_guy: well, that depends. how you encode it is determined by the server side code. if it is a "normal" POST or GET, then you would URL encode it with encodeURI in js
[23:25:59] <doug65536> the_cyber_guy: what does that have to do with json though?
[23:28:47] <doug65536> wow, is there really no json encoder in jquery? I always thought there was
[23:28:55] <doug65536> just $.serializeArray from form?
[23:30:02] <the_cyber_guy> doug65536, on server side the request variables will be parsed as array like array("message"=>"Hello"), so i need some common method to implement both on server side as well as client side to get the right hmac on both side. i was thinking to urlencode the data object and generate hmac on client side and on do the same on server side too.
[23:39:11] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/fXCS5/ <-- how can i make use of var wrapper, to access the child element? can somone help me please..
[23:40:05] <Cork> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/fXCS5/1/
[23:40:27] <Cork> axscode: though it is pointless to do that for id's
[23:40:43] <Cork> axscode: id's my only exist once in the page, so you don't need a parent
[23:41:02] <axscode> ah this is just for my learning.. checking now
[23:41:06] <Cork> axscode: if you plan to have the same thing multiple times, use a class instead
[23:41:26] <Cork> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/fXCS5/2/
[23:41:52] <axscode> so children is correct.. hmmm...
[23:42:07] <Cork> axscode: well if you have multiple levels, you want .find
[23:42:29] <Cork> axscode: but for direct decedent children works
[23:42:51] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/fXCS5/3/ <-- how about this one?
[23:43:18] <axscode> i want to get the classes and use it strings
[23:43:49] <Cork> axscode: there are no txt command
[23:43:54] <Cork> its text
[23:44:38] <axscode> i wanted to get the classses as text.
[23:45:02] <Cork> axscode: replace txt with text
[23:45:52] <axscode> ah
[23:51:42] <the_cyber_guy> doug65536, $.param({message: "Hello"}) will return "message=Hello" and encodeURIComponent will return its urlencoded value. this is what i wanted. thanks for your help.
