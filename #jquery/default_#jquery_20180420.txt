[02:13:56] <ryan_ford> are most jQuery projects still using requirejs?
[02:23:13] <ryan_ford> or just load modules with the ready event hook?
[05:02:55] <vish93> hey taplar :)
[05:07:19] <devi8> Hey all, I am trying to parse a bunch of crappy html tables created by Ikea but I am having a hard time figuring out just what needs to be done.
[05:07:29] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/PeqZzK?editors=1111
[05:14:31] <Cork> devi8: parse?
[05:15:04] <Cork> devi8: why exactly do you need to parse it?
[05:15:21] <Cork> (walk i could understand but parse...)
[05:15:34] <devi8> I need a single table. Walk may be the better word, sorry
[05:16:30] <Cork> ok so what exactly is it you need?
[05:16:49] <devi8> an itemized list of items grouped by cabinet number
[05:17:25] <devi8> I am having a hard time figuring out the approach. Should I clean up each cell first?
[05:17:40] <devi8> Or should I create a new table and try to extract the data I want?
[05:17:45] <Cork> most likely not
[05:17:51] <Cork> where is the cabinet number?
[05:18:00] <Cork> ex 50265502?
[05:18:11] <devi8> no it's a single number like 1
[05:18:20] <devi8> at the very beginning of the table
[05:18:25] <Cork> the one just over the images?
[05:18:32] <devi8> yes
[05:18:55] <devi8> then the images should be two different fields
[05:19:18] <devi8> and the contents should be a subtable (in another field)
[05:19:33] <Cork> ok so per cabinet number you want what?
[05:19:37] <devi8> I'll write it out how it should look. that would probably help.
[05:20:21] <Cork> devi8: cause the simplest solution is to just grab what you want locate the table_cell_separator related to the target you found
[05:20:28] <Cork> and then just populate an object with the data
[05:22:53] <Cork> so something like $('.table_item_unitprice').each(function() { var cabinet = $(this).closest('table').find('.table_cell_separator').text(); cabinets[cabinet] ||= []; cabinets[cabinet].push($(this).text()); })
[05:22:57] <Cork> for the unit price
[05:23:26] <Cork> then you can locate the sku and other values sounding the column you base it on
[05:23:29] <Cork> it is fairly simple
[05:28:24] <devi8> I'll try it that way. thanks.
[05:29:04] <devi8> here is the basic table how it should look when I am done. I'll try doing it the way you suggested. thanks again.
[05:29:07] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/PeqZzK?editors=1111
[05:29:59] <Cork> you might actually be able to do that with just css...
[05:30:05] <Cork> but ya, what ever :)
[06:05:13] <devi8> ikea sucks for generating that html.
[06:15:52] <ryan_ford> i thought it was a pun when you first started
[06:16:13] <ryan_ford> tables from ikea
[06:16:17] <devi8> that's hilarious
[06:27:00] <vish93> Hey guys I have the following  https://jsfiddle.net/vw4norfx/24/ however, when I add and remove items sharply it causes undefined in the removal causing weird calculations. Could anyone hep me see where I am going wrong?
[06:32:27] <inventor888> hello - can someone assist? How can I redirect a user back to the page they came from to visit my link?
[06:32:46] <inventor888> hello - can someone assist? How can I redirect a user back to the page they came from to visit my site*?
[06:33:13] <vish93> inventor888: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_his_back.asp ?
[06:34:15] <inventor888> history.back wont work via redirect.
[06:34:25] <inventor888> @ vish93
[06:35:23] <inventor888> anyone?
[06:35:29] <vish93> are you using refresh to redirect?
[06:36:31] <inventor888> I think you misunderstood...redirect is from the site the user clicked on the link to get to my site
[06:38:46] <ryan_ford> probably need to pass the referrer info via url params
[06:39:29] <inventor888> hmm - thanks ryan_ford - I'm not sure how you would do that?
[06:39:30] <ryan_ford> you're going from a -> b -> c and you want to send people back from c -> a ?
[06:39:38] <inventor888> yes
[06:41:00] <inventor888> I also want to send back if they use # and also if their url has querystrings... - I believe document.referrer doesn't give you that information
[06:41:29] <ryan_ford> Do you have any control over A and B?
[06:41:57] <inventor888> No - the link could be on a blog site for example
[06:44:26] <vish93> inventor888: what if you store a referenece to the refferer ?
[06:45:44] <ryan_ford> I'm not real familiar with the History API, https://devdocs.io/dom/history_api , but can you do something like window.history.go(-2); ?
[06:46:11] <inventor888> how do I access that reference? @vish93
[06:46:56] <ryan_ford> ^^ that's why I was asking if you had any control. ideally you could pass that info in the url params
[06:46:59] <inventor888> ryan_ford, there might be more than 1 redirect. I don't know how many. So I can't rely on history.back(any number here)
[06:47:20] <ryan_ford> if you know it's out of your control, why are you trying to control it? ðŸ¤”
[06:47:26] <vish93> inventor888: document.referrer ?
[06:47:57] <inventor888> If I had control - how could I pass that info?
[06:48:05] <inventor888> @ ryan_ford
[06:48:42] <inventor888> @vish93, document.referrer doesn't work if url has querystrings
[06:48:56] <ryan_ford> url.to.yoursite.com/?referrer=medium , something like that
[06:49:43] <vish93> @ryan_ford would you pretty please be able to have a gander at https://jsfiddle.net/vw4norfx/24/ ?
[06:50:16] <inventor888> I see - then I would have to extract everything ?referrer @ryan_ford
[06:50:25] <inventor888> everything after*
[06:51:07] <ryan_ford> that's the idea
[06:51:24] <ryan_ford> same way you would post form data via url
[06:51:37] <AdamPDotty> vish93: fiddle still looks somewhat messy, as nothing happens you should test smaller parts first.
[06:51:57] <vish93> AdamPDotty: stores in local storage
[06:53:55] <AdamPDotty> anyway so far: You should not juggle with the id, when everything is that compact.
[06:54:55] <AdamPDotty> maybe take a look at start of event handler in https://jsfiddle.net/vw4norfx/33/
[06:55:21] <AdamPDotty> tried to clean it up, but it is not obvious what should happen and what does not happen.
[07:01:49] <vish93> @AdampDotty I will do, when you check the checkbox the ok and quantity box is revealed, which when you okay adds to an array as a object. That is then stored in localstorage
[07:05:17] <vish93> Thinking I need to add a throttle, giving time for the slicing of arrays etc to finish
[07:07:11] <AdamPDotty> ok, for me nothing is hidden from the beginning
[07:07:26] <AdamPDotty> I would rather have a class "hidden" than "visible".
[07:07:32] <AdamPDotty> visible should be default
[07:08:00] <AdamPDotty> I did not check storage.
[07:10:49] <vish93> AdamPDotty: yeah in the exmaple ivâ€™e left it on show.
[07:11:27] <vish93> Yeah on chrome can see it under application :)
[07:35:17] <vish93> It is to do with the monthArr.filter(function(element){return element.id == id})[0] returning null
[07:44:02] <vish93> brb
[08:25:51] <vish93> hey sorry back :)
[08:57:09] <hollusion> $.getScript( "ajax/test.js" ) <-- this will load and execute the script and return the raw code as text, right?
[08:57:48] <preference> load, then execute
[08:57:49] <preference> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[08:57:53] <hollusion> how do i make test.js return an object that i can access?
[08:58:05] <preference> it won't print it
[08:58:29] <hollusion> $.getScript( "ajax/test.js" ).done(function(data) { })
[08:58:46] <hollusion> data seems to hold the raw code as a string
[08:59:02] <hollusion> but i would like data to be the returned object from test.js
[08:59:46] <hollusion> or what would be a good way of acheiving this?
[09:00:01] <hollusion> because i dont like accessing a variable that has been defined in test.js
[09:00:16] <hollusion> id like to assign the result of test.js to a variable that i am using in the main.js
[09:02:17] <preference> hollusion: sorry, that's beyond me
[09:12:12] <ryan_ford> does getScript return something like a promise?
[09:15:08] <ryan_ford> https://stackoverflow.com/a/17886369
[09:15:47] <ryan_ford> working with async stuff can be a bit mind bending, if you don't want to deal with promises, that might be an approach you could take instead
[09:16:31] <vish93> Hey ryan_ford if I fire monthArr.filter(function(element){return element.id == id})[0]; in quick succession, it results in undefined. Is there a way to make it quicker or wait for previous to finish?
[09:17:20] <ryan_ford> you could use a deferred object/promise and chain them
[09:19:33] <ryan_ford> what is element? you *shouldn't* be having an issue with just that snippet
[09:22:38] <vish93> @ryan_ford I have an array stored in localstorage: https://jsfiddle.net/vw4norfx/33/
[09:23:07] <vish93> some reason it is causing undefined that line when I remove not in sequence
[09:23:49] <hollusion> $.when($.getScript('script.js'), $.getJSON('data.json')).done(function (getScript, getJSON) {});
[09:23:54] <hollusion> ryan_ford, thats how i use it
[09:24:32] <hollusion> the problem is, i would love to access the script.js within th done() function
[09:24:35] <ryan_ford> so it's a promise
[09:25:35] <ryan_ford> I recently had this struggle with native promises, and you just have to stop thinking in terms of values. It's not a value, it's a means to *get* a value. So you have to *use* the value in a then callback
[09:25:42] <hollusion> my "problem" is that getScript immediately executes script.js (which is okay) but i want to access the result somehow
[09:26:00] <hollusion> and not simple use a ver that is defined in script.js
[09:26:01] <ryan_ford> Trying to store it is like trying to write synchronous code asynchronously if that makes sense
[09:26:14] <hollusion> because that would make the main.js script a bit confusing
[09:26:36] <hollusion> *not simply use a variable
[09:28:58] <ryan_ford> https://stackoverflow.com/a/22536838
[09:29:37] <sunrunner20> ok, i've gotta be doing this wrong. What is the correct way to populate a dropdown with ajax every time a form field changes, but not have it constantly add the same values over and over?
[09:30:47] <ryan_ford> .merge or .extend?
[09:34:08] <sunrunner20> I'll try that
[09:47:56] <sunrunner20> no merge won't do what I want
[09:48:02] <sunrunner20> it'll just keep adding like append will
[09:49:43] <sunrunner20> looks like extend might work
[10:33:36] <MikeD_> jqTgt.attr('data-notifyEvent')  should that now be:  jqTgt.prop('data-notifyEvent') or jqTgt.data('notifyEvent')  ?
[11:38:53] <Cork> MikeD_: first or last
[11:39:16] <Cork> MikeD_: .prop can't set data- attributes (as they are attributes not properties)
[11:40:42] <Cork> the difference between using .data or .attr is that .data parses the original attribute, and can store anything you can reference in javascript
[11:40:51] <Cork> while .attr can only handle strings
[12:27:35] <emihir0> hi. how can I attach an onclick event to inputs on forms that have IDs like: id_formset-quantities-0-assortment_repetitions, id_formset-quantities-1-assortment_repetitions, id_formset-quantities-2-assortment_repetitions?
[12:27:46] <emihir0> ie. the number changes
[12:28:18] <emihir0> so I cannot really do $('#id_formset-quantities-1-assortment_repetitions').click(...) because that would trigger only upon clicking the first one
[12:31:52] <ryan_ford> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/190253/jquery-selector-regular-expressions
[12:32:56] <emihir0> thanks ryan_ford !
[12:34:35] <ryan_ford> this one was down near the bottom, but if you don't have conflicting id patterns maybe it's a good option https://devdocs.io/jquery/attribute-starts-with-selector
[12:35:44] <emihir0> that looks interesting too
[12:35:49] <emihir0> thanks a lot, that got me started
[12:36:28] <ryan_ford> ðŸ˜„
[12:46:44] <RyansWorld> Are there any good node.js irc channels?
[12:53:39] <deadowl> I think I've got a possible race condition in one of my scripts because a third party integration decided to start loading HTML content asynchronously. How would I fire an event once a specific selector matched? $('#id').on('load')?
[12:54:01] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[12:54:05] <robertmaxrees> load event handlers are funky.
[12:54:13] <robertmaxrees> what's the third party integration?
[12:55:54] <deadowl> formassembly
[12:56:04] <pavonia> RyansWorld: Tried #node.js?
[12:56:57] <RyansWorld> Have not!
[12:58:49] <robertmaxrees> deadowl looks like a paid solution - if that's the case, reach out to them and ask them what you should do.
[13:24:00] <deadowl> well, wait, looks like not an async thing.
[13:24:08] <deadowl> but don't know what :(
[13:24:33] <deadowl> I can't even replicate it, I've tried every major browser on every operating system
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> deadowl so why do you think it's a race condition?
[13:26:30] <deadowl> partly page load time variability and partly because I can't replicate it, although I'm also looking into things like antivirus/security software at this point.
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> sorry, lemme rephrase - can you describe the bug you're trying to solve?
[13:27:27] <deadowl> Okay, so a section of a form disappears and javascript seems to fail altogether.
[13:28:29] <robertmaxrees> when you say "fails", are you getting errors?  can you share the code that fails?
[13:28:47] <deadowl> I can't replicate it
[13:28:51] <deadowl> so I have no clue.
[13:29:22] <robertmaxrees> is this a bug report from one user?
[13:29:25] <deadowl> I can say that the formassembly integration clientside validation rules are failing.
[13:29:30] <deadowl> Observed for 2-3 users.
[13:29:35] <deadowl> out of hundreds
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> any js errors or anything?
[13:30:14] <robertmaxrees> or they just say it "doesn't work"
[13:30:27] <deadowl> one sec
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz
[15:17:29] <dnscat> boom tst boom tst boom tst boom tst
[16:11:38] <ezio> How do I get a reference to the current $el in an onclick="
[16:11:54] <robertmaxrees> ezio use .on() instead :)
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> and then it's $(this)(
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> * $(this)
[16:12:10] <ezio> I don't wanna
[16:12:14] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:12:19] <taplar> $el makes it sound like he's using a framework
[16:12:23] <ezio> i wanna inline that shit
[16:12:30] <robertmaxrees> ezio inlining is a bad idea.
[16:12:36] <ezio> no i'm not using a framework
[16:12:37] <ezio> sorry
[16:12:43] <ezio> php brain scramble
[16:13:30] <ezio> I just want something like $(this).parents('.something').find('.somethingelse').toggle();
[16:13:45] <robertmaxrees> .closest() instead of .parents()
[16:14:04] <ezio> oh nice
[19:01:31] <fearnothing> for a form, is it possible to have a button that triggers a given form input (file, submit etc) without writing a specific function to link the button click to the input?
[19:01:53] <robertmaxrees> "triggers a given form input" meaning...
[19:02:03] <robertmaxrees> like, focuses on that input?
[19:02:42] <fearnothing> so, in the file here:
[19:02:43] <fearnothing> https://github.com/scherma/antfarm/blob/master/src/node/views/files.hbs
[19:03:13] <fearnothing> oh wait, I think I see my problem...
[19:03:19] <fearnothing> one sec...
[19:04:02] <fearnothing> yeah my bad I needed to use <label> not <button>
[19:04:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:06:22] <robertmaxrees> so it was to focus on 'em then? :)
[19:11:58] <fearnothing> not sure I have understood the definition of 'focus' correctly?
[19:13:27] <robertmaxrees> what did you mean by "triggers a given form input"?
[19:15:27] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:29:21] <fearnothing> I guess I meant inputs which have buttons like file and submit, to click that button
[19:29:36] <fearnothing> but it was very poorly articulated :)
[19:29:44] <robertmaxrees> ah.
