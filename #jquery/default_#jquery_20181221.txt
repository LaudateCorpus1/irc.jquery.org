[05:33:53] <patriick> hi
[09:19:35] <johnnnnnnn> hey there
[09:37:13] <johnnnnnn> hey everyone :)
[09:40:52] <johnnnnnn> i have a quick question. i know a lot of languages, but all backend dev. i started a new job that is asking me to do some frontend stuff... i have a jQuery app that has a date selecter, and i need to use jQuery Validate to ensure the date is AFTER the current day. i have a rules: { "request-date": { required:true }} so I know I need to add something in there along with required: true
[09:46:58] <johnnnnnn> pm me if you can help me thanks!
[11:57:08] <SkaBob> How do I properly prevent hitting enter on a text input from submitting a form, if preventDefault(), stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation() and return false are all still allowing it to submit and reset the page?
[12:06:46] <MikeD_> are you calling those methods on the event object that was passed to your handler?
[12:09:05] <SkaBob> MikeD_: yep
[12:09:21] <SkaBob> MikeD_: on a keyup on the input box
[12:16:36] <SkaBob> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/104xsymo/  I think that approximates the behavior I'm getting. On mine it submits and reloads the page, where jsfiddle it 404s. If I take out the <form></form> tags, it does what I want, but I don't think that's "correct"...
[12:18:01] <SkaBob> I'm totally fine if it ISN'T incorrect, because I don't NEED it to be a form, unless that breaks how bootstrap will build it. Everything I do with it is through custom javacsript, and not the form submission...
[12:18:26] <SkaBob> Just seemed an odd thing to remove, so I don't want to remove those tags, if it would be improper...
[12:48:10] <lurkashflake> $('#button').on('click touchstart', function(){//whatever}); On mobile the button that was previously unclickable is not clickable but it act weirdly, if you hold it will complete the operation if we tap once it will trigger a second tap
[12:48:22] <lurkashflake> How do I fix mobile tap behavior?
[12:48:36] <lurkashflake> s/not/now
[12:49:08] <lurkashflake> I think it's because the click function was previously working for some so those that work will trigger double click
[12:50:31] <lurkashflake> huh it's a mess the button previously unclickable is clicklable again
[12:50:39] <lurkashflake> s/clickable/unclickable

[13:06:00] <Caspan> i am trying to do an onclick event that when you click on this DIV it will find a parent DIV with the class .TaskCard  then find a child with the DIV calls CardBody
[13:07:03] <Caspan> $( ".InnerRight" ).click(function() { Find parent then child })
[13:23:25] <jak2000> hi all
[13:23:35] <jak2000> merry xmas! hic
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> merry christmas
[13:26:58] <Caspan> woudl this work?   $(this).parent(".TaskCard").find(".CardBody").addClass("ShowSlide");
[13:27:26] <Caspan> take the element i clicked on and gets a parrent with the class of TaskCard then find a child called .CardBody and adds a class to it
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[13:28:39] <robertmaxrees> Caspan so .parent() always selects the first ancestor.  passing it a class filters it on that class.
[13:28:51] <Caspan> ohh
[13:28:59] <Caspan> so my parent is liek 3 away
[13:29:09] <Caspan> well the parent i am looking for is 3-4 away
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() instead then
[13:29:14] <Caspan> ahh
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.TaskCard')
[13:29:25] <Caspan> I always thing closet is downword not upword of the dom
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> that starts at the current element and then goes through all ancestors.
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> .find() goes through all descendents
[13:29:52] <Caspan> yeas
[13:29:55] <Caspan> crap thanks
[13:30:27] <Caspan> works now
[13:30:48] <Caspan> $(this).closest(".TaskCard").find(".CardBody").addClass("SlideShow")
[13:30:55] <Caspan> okay so that works great now
[13:30:56] <Caspan> thanks
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> killer
[13:31:07] <Caspan> man i keep locing jquery
[13:31:11] <Caspan> loving
[13:31:15] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> it definitely can make life easier.
[14:02:30] <MikeD_> if put a span into a hidden div, how can i get the width of the span?
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kxo0d6L/ ?
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> if the span is still inline, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kxo0d6L/2/ - you'll always get 0.
[14:06:54] <MikeD_> cool, i assumed the 0 was due to being hidden
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ ^
[14:06:59] <robertmaxrees> oh hah.
[14:07:17] <robertmaxrees> and yes.  it is.  if it's inline and a parent is hidden, it has no width
[15:01:29] <MikeD_> i have an old installation of jquery 1.11 and i'm trying to add a class to tooltip ... via the tooltipClass option  but it does not appear to be working in the environment
[15:01:39] <MikeD_> any idea what else i should be looking at?
[15:01:55] <MikeD_> i see that option is deprecated in favor of a classes option
[15:03:21] <MikeD_> nm, i just specified both
[17:44:08] <al_nz1> how is the fail function called? https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-registration/blob/7cef1daeab9c7e62173dea9d463c152d4d571098/src/main/resources/templates/registration.html#L112
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean in jquery?
[17:46:09] <robertmaxrees> can be a few different reasons.  why do you ask?
[17:49:58] <al_nz1> Hi Robert. I want to understand when/how it gets called
[17:50:34] <robertmaxrees> the network request could have returned an error code.
[17:50:41] <robertmaxrees> or the response body is poorly formatted.
[17:52:07] <al_nz1> why is it .fail (as in why is there a dot in front?)
[17:52:40] <robertmaxrees> it's like .catch()
[17:52:57] <al_nz1> for the function register(event)
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> it's setting a callback.
[17:53:31] <robertmaxrees> using the old noncompliant promises setup
[17:53:48] <al_nz1> you said its like .catch, normally catch has a try - whats the corresponding try in this case?
[17:53:53] <robertmaxrees> nono.
[17:53:57] <robertmaxrees> catch for promises.
[17:54:02] <robertmaxrees> .then().catch*(
[17:54:05] <robertmaxrees> *.catch()
[17:54:12] <robertmaxrees> not try/catch error handling.
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> are you confused about what the .fail() is chained off of?>?
[17:55:00] <al_nz1> I guess what method/function triggers a call to the .fail
[17:55:15] <robertmaxrees> the $.post() hitting an eror case.
[17:56:14] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/01cc33c67a4c
[17:56:24] <robertmaxrees> it's easier to understand if you format it like this.
[17:57:19] <robertmaxrees> make more sense?
[17:57:30] <al_nz1> ok, so at a high level, the ready event contains a function called during sumbit (register function) which if there is a fail can show certain errors (there is also some password stuff in there I see)
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> are you asking about the .fail() or are you asking something else?
[17:58:12] <al_nz1> the flow of all that code
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> \
[17:59:28] <robertmaxrees> register is being used to handle the submit event of that form, yes.
[17:59:48] <robertmaxrees> the "password stuff" is also another event handler.
[18:00:09] <robertmaxrees> did you have any specific questions?
[18:00:51] <al_nz1> not any more
[18:00:52] <al_nz1> thanks
[18:00:58] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
