[06:40:11] <thykka> should probably be i++, not ++i
[08:49:38] <diverdude> I have code like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Xcb2XyxrMh/    in my ready fct. I hate these 2 "global" variables, last_line and repeat_cnt. Is there some way i can elegantly wrap those in a "Immediately-Invoked Function Expression" construct or something similar?
