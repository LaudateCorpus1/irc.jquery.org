[01:10:54] <NaN> hi there
[01:14:06] <user_corrupt> I have the following modal window that I am able to open by clicking a link: https://jsfiddle.net/user_corrupt/a40uzn75/1/ and I am trying to figure out how to call it onload instead.
[01:15:26] <NaN> how can I select all the span elements starting with .active? >> https://jsfiddle.net/4x11wa1k/
[01:22:52] <SkyFire> well im getting somewhere

[01:23:13] <SkyFire> i was right
[01:23:16] <SkyFire> the scripts were missing
[01:23:21] <SkyFire> now to limit the dates...
[02:23:08] <fattest> why doesn't my append work? https://jsfiddle.net/pz9xkeec/
[02:35:16] <hellyeah> morning
[02:35:40] <hellyeah> i try to use localstorage what did i do wrong here can you help me to figure it out https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/2/
[02:51:59] <BradenBraden> hmm... if i havent used IRC for a while, can my nick be de-registered?
[02:52:39] <hellyeah> afaik if you dont register your nick 30 days
[02:52:49] <hellyeah> it will be unregistered by system
[02:52:56] <hellyeah> btw question
[02:52:58] <hellyeah> hey i can get the value and print to console but what i want is when i refreesh the page Text in inputbox must be there what am i missing here https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/6/
[02:53:02] <BradenBraden> dang. alright.
[02:54:13] <hellyeah> you can ask those stuff in #freenode
[02:54:14] <BradenBraden> not sure. havent used localstorage before
[03:29:21] <hellyeah> hey anyone ardound?
[03:30:43] <Robdgreat> yeah. btw it used to be that nicks weren't automatically purged, and if someone wanted a nick that hadn't signed on in more than whatever the acceptable threshold was they could go into #freenode and request that it be deregistered
[03:30:53] <Robdgreat> otherwise it would just linger
[03:31:21] <hellyeah> if i type short string then i perviously typed. It remembered pervious text. What is the reason of that pls help  https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/10/
[03:31:32] <wa5ted_> hellyeah im around!
[03:31:40] <wa5ted_> pun instended
[03:31:42] <wa5ted_> intended
[03:31:49] <hellyeah> wa5ted_: how is it going?
[03:31:55] <wa5ted_> pretty good
[03:32:03] <wa5ted> just aobut to hit the sack
[03:32:08] <wa5ted> slept during thed ay so im fucked
[03:32:16] <hellyeah> hahaha
[03:32:16] <wa5ted> and im working on a project I know nothing about
[03:32:22] <hellyeah> xD
[03:32:29] <wa5ted> i have to somehow integrate  a static site into magento
[03:32:32] <hellyeah> kinda overwhelming huh
[03:32:39] <wa5ted> i even told the client I am not handling backend
[03:32:46] <wa5ted>  a tad
[03:32:54] <hellyeah> people here want me to help project i know nothing about
[03:33:04] <wa5ted> im not in this business for the bull of integration
[03:33:09] <wa5ted> i provide basic support
[03:33:34] <hellyeah> well life is full of suprises
[03:33:40] <hellyeah> do you know localstorage
[03:34:05] <dd3es> Hi there, this is a super basic question, but this should work, right? el.on('keyup', functioDosomething());
[03:34:24] <dd3es> Giving a function directly as a on parameter
[03:34:30] <dd3es> instead of instantiating a anon func
[03:34:37] <dd3es> This doesn't work for me for some reason
[03:34:41] <hellyeah> remove ()
[03:34:50] <dd3es> What if the function has parameters?
[03:34:52] <hellyeah> are you trying to do delegation?
[03:34:55] <dd3es>      $('#searchFaq').on('keyup', doLogic($('#searchFaq'), $('.faqContainer'),  $('.questionContainer')));
[03:35:10] <wa5ted> hellyeah: i know of it (if you are refering to html5 local storage) never tapped into it too much
[03:35:15] <hellyeah> i dont know that part
[03:35:24] <hellyeah> but
[03:35:32] <hellyeah> delegation may not get parameter
[03:35:37] <hellyeah> so check it out
[03:35:46] <dd3es> mnhh
[03:35:47] <dd3es> I see
[03:35:53] <hellyeah> wa5ted: https://jsfiddle.net/j84r2968/10/
[03:35:59] <dd3es> Is it bad practice to call it inside of another function?
[03:36:24] <hellyeah> dd3es: you want to call a function when an event is triggered
[03:36:27] <hellyeah> ?
[03:36:35] <wa5ted> whatabout it
[03:36:54] <hellyeah> did you see long text wa5ted
[03:36:56] <hellyeah> ?
[03:37:00] <wa5ted> no
[03:37:00] <dd3es> Correct, it works when I call it in an anonymous function
[03:37:22] <hellyeah> dd3es: if you fiddle it people can help you more effectively
[03:37:30] <wa5ted> its called local torage for a reason
[03:37:31] <dd3es> Okay, one moment
[03:37:41] <hellyeah> okey wa5ted pls type long text and refresh the page
[03:37:54] <hellyeah> you will see text in input box
[03:37:56] <wa5ted> cool
[03:38:04] <hellyeah> and type short one refresh the page
[03:38:11] <hellyeah> you see pervious text
[03:38:20] <hellyeah> because it is longer
[03:38:35] <hellyeah> but if you type longer text then pervious you will see longer one
[03:38:43] <hellyeah> i dont understand why it happened
[03:38:53] <hellyeah> it didnt remember correct one in all cases
[03:39:37] <hellyeah> dd3es: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[03:39:48] <hellyeah> wa5ted: did you see what i intended to tell
[03:40:01] <wa5ted> ?
[03:40:31] <hellyeah> you may not understand
[03:40:43] <hellyeah> anyway localstorage didnt work correctly for some reason
[03:41:44] <hellyeah> i did somethingh wrong
[03:44:03] <denthaman> Guys, I am looking through some code at github and something got me baffled. The code is at https://github.com/kevinkhill/cemd/blob/master/public/js/cemd/dashboard.js  Am I correct in saying that the window.CEMD provides a namespace?
[03:47:03] <WilsonG> On parent element hover i display child element, how to disable mouseover for a child element? because its doubles the animation, because mouseover selector is parent
[03:50:04] <hexdj> could someone tell me what the error in the console here is? http://jsbin.com/ladoqameka/edit?html,console,output
[04:01:27] <wa5ted> hexdj: idk you tell me
[04:01:54] <hexdj> .... very helpful
[04:02:40] <wa5ted> hexdj: i know what it is
[04:02:45] <wa5ted> see if you can figur eit out
[04:02:48] <wa5ted> ill give oyu a hint
[04:02:51] <wa5ted> you need an event
[04:03:17] <wa5ted> what you are doing now is check it on start
[04:03:28] <wa5ted> what you need to do is check it when ever the input value has changed
[04:03:51] <wa5ted> also you have another bug with respect to your code
[04:05:40] <wa5ted> hexdj: figure it out?
[04:06:15] <hexdj> no
[04:08:24] <denthaman> Guys, I am looking through some code at github and something got me baffled. The code is at https://github.com/kevinkhill/cemd/blob/master/public/js/cemd/dashboard.js Am I correct in saying that the window.CEMD provides a namespace?
[04:08:57] <wa5ted> hexdj: you have a .each which is good, but you havent bound it to an event, so basically your .each checks all the required inputs on load and doesnt check them there after
[04:09:08] <wa5ted> yu need a keyup, keydown or keypress event
[04:09:16] <wa5ted> or a .change event on the input
[04:09:26] <wa5ted> to run the .each everytime you add text
[04:09:40] <hexdj> ah ok
[04:09:43] <hexdj> thanks
[04:09:52] <wa5ted> play aorund with your dom and stuff
[04:09:57] <hexdj> should I use .find in combo with .each?
[04:10:04] <hexdj> or should .each be enough?
[04:10:07] <wa5ted> not entirely necessary
[04:10:15] <wa5ted> nest your .each inside a key event and you gucci
[04:10:27] <wa5ted> hexdj: btw you have a second bug with respect to white space so check that out
[04:13:07] <hexdj> k, this works: http://jsbin.com/ladoqameka/edit?html,js,output

[05:36:00] <DelphiWorld> yo all

[05:39:20] <vcw23d> Hi there, I have an input which listens for the onkeydown event. Now, when the value of said input box is < 3, I show something. The event is ignored if i use ctrl+a backspace
[05:39:27] <vcw23d> any way to get around this?
[05:46:19] <Uhkis> vcw23d: try listening input instead
[05:46:35] <km4> https://jsfiddle.net/f93jev0r/ anyone clean this code or its fine ? (works ok)
[05:49:51] <Uhkis> km4: instead of multiple calls, you can add to the selector like $('#id, .class, class2'), not sure if cleaner or more maintainable though
[05:50:03] <Uhkis> less lines at least
[05:51:39] <DelphiWorld> guys, i am using this to read the track position from local storage: $("#cast")[counter].currentTime=localStorage.getItem('position');. correct or no?
[05:51:41] <km4> ah yes ;)
[05:51:51] <DelphiWorld> the counter is a variable for chousing the source of the track
[05:58:55] <DelphiWorld> no one? :-P

[07:05:54] <xenaxon> so during the time the MOUSE is down, I want a function to continue fireing
[07:06:25] <hellyeah> okey
[07:06:30] <hellyeah> thats the logic it seems
[07:08:07] <cannap> $('selector').on('mousedown(function() { });
[07:08:15] <hellyeah> you want to hold mouse
[07:08:21] <hellyeah> or just like click https://jsfiddle.net/cofe67af/
[07:08:22] <cannap> and then check for the release
[07:08:52] <hellyeah> there must be different event for holding mouse down on button
[07:17:50] <hellyeah> whyy this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/Ltssjbbg/1/
[07:18:27] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cofe67af/10/
[07:19:19] <cannap> @xenaxon
[07:20:04] <cannap> hellyeah because jqueryUI ?
[07:20:28] <cannap> ah you have included
[07:21:12] <cannap> @hellyeah http://jsfiddle.net/Ltssjbbg/3/
[07:21:16] <cannap> rtfm
[07:21:19] <cannap> :D

[07:43:36] <nru> hi if i have a form in which i have a button which opens a popup with a site containing another form, is it possible that if i post data from that popup form that i can receive those fields and put it in to the fields of my current form?
[08:27:55] <hellyeah> hey
[08:28:08] <hellyeah> is there a way to disable body?
[08:32:36] <Xentil> hellyeah: yes
[08:33:10] <hellyeah> Xentil: how?
[08:44:16] <raskel> hey guys, i have this line: jQuery(".SalesEventMsrp").data('idx', data_idx).html(products[prod_idx].msrp); and i really dont get it why it doesnt work. i DO a foreach ( actually it's a for ), and i do pass that data_idx. PROBLEM: it does UPDATE with the same value all my data... i have that common class and a custom attirbute ( data-idx ) with a unique value/index... any idea?
[08:47:42] <Uhkis> raskel: you set jquery internal data, not the data- attribute
[08:50:15] <kostodo> i have some elements with id's like #foo-item, #foo2-item, #foobar-item
[08:50:30] <kostodo> How do clip off the -item off the end?
[08:50:51] <raskel> Uhkis, ohh, thanks! i got it
[08:51:03] <kostodo> and replace it with -form
[08:51:09] <kostodo> actually replacing is fine
[08:51:14] <kostodo> Just need to know how to clip it off
[08:52:29] <Uhkis> "clip it off" ?
[08:52:39] <kostodo> yeah to save to a string
[08:52:59] <kostodo> '#foo-item' to '#foo'
[08:53:07] <kostodo> where foo is variable
[08:53:18] <kostodo> -item is always the same
[08:53:23] <kostodo> 5 chars
[08:54:06] <Uhkis> String.substring ?
[08:54:17] <Uhkis> String.split ?
[08:54:32] <kostodo> how do you go from the back of the string?
[08:54:41] <kostodo> i.e. remove back 5 chars
[08:55:10] <Uhkis> substring can take negative start
[08:55:49] <Uhkis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring
[08:56:10] <kostodo> so like $(this).attr('id').substing(-5,5) ?
[08:59:09] <Uhkis> tias ;)
[09:01:36] <kostodo> well that -5 didnt work
[09:10:03] <wa5ted> hellyeah: want a challenge/
[09:10:19] <hellyeah> like
[09:10:21] <hellyeah> xD
[09:10:25] <hellyeah> likje what
[09:10:47] <wa5ted> i got a  challenge for someone: take a range input with step 0.0000001 min = -7 max = 7 and convert the value so that they translate to time as you move the slider from left to right starting at 6am and going to 8pm, incrimenting by 5 minute intervals
[09:12:06] <wa5ted> hellyeah:  what you think
[09:12:54] <hellyeah> i dont have any idea right now :p
[09:13:19] <hellyeah> sorry my english is kinda screwwed
[09:14:54] <Uhkis> i think theres a lot more time than that with so small step
[09:33:19] <wa5ted> Uhkis: steps can be rounded
[09:33:21] <wa5ted> if needed
[09:44:25] <sigdk> how can I make this example work on jsfiddle: https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html ?
[09:48:37] <taplar> that page provides the sources you can copy over.
[09:53:42] <hellyeah> is there a way disable all possible events of spesific element at once?
[09:54:15] <taplar> define 'disable'
[09:54:37] <ChaoticEmergence> render hadicapped
[09:54:40] <taplar> and why would you ant to do that?
[09:54:50] <hellyeah> like this  $('.insidebody').click(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); event.stopPropagation(); })
[09:55:40] <hellyeah> it is the example
[09:55:41] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/qmfjshLd/6/
[09:55:58] <hellyeah> when i get dialog box i want to disable body and element in the body except dialog box
[09:56:13] <hellyeah> and when i click closing button on dialog i will enable everything
[09:57:02] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[09:57:21] <taplar> not entirely yet.  seems heavy handed
[09:57:35] <hellyeah> heavy handed?
[09:57:40] <hellyeah> what does it mean?
[09:57:44] <taplar> what problem are you trying to solve
[09:57:58] <hellyeah> well we have service for sending sms
[09:58:07] <taplar> heavy handed refers to trying to do a lot to solve a little problem
[09:58:28] <hellyeah> we call the page in case of getting exception i want to warn user and disable the page until he read the message and click close button
[09:58:52] <taplar> cases like that can be done by an overlay and a dialog
[09:59:28] <hellyeah> actually insidebody and outsidebody is kinda overlar no?
[09:59:29] <taplar> afk a sec, i'll explain afterwards if you have a question about that
[09:59:37] <hellyeah> okey
[10:10:33] <_TWG_> Is robert online today?
[10:13:52] <taplar> robert comes on a couple hours from now
[10:13:55] <taplar> ish
[10:14:54] <_TWG_> Dang, okay.  Thanks taplar
[10:15:20] <taplar> one more sec hellyeah got one more thing.
[10:15:24] <taplar> TWG did you have a quesiton?
[10:16:42] <_TWG_> Well he was helping me yesterday with a P.O.C. and his fiddle is working but when I use my code it doesn't work.
[10:18:40] <taplar> ah
[10:19:03] <taplar> hellyeah:ok, did you have a question about what i said about the overlay?
[10:19:42] <hellyeah> taplar:
[10:19:45] <hellyeah> gotta smoke
[10:19:58] <taplar> k
[10:20:02] <hellyeah> 5 mins
[10:20:15] <_TWG_> He was educating me on using a .map() on my array and mine looks similar but I keep getting an error that the currentObject.data.map is not a function.
[10:20:50] <taplar> what's your fiddle?
[10:21:04] <_TWG_> http://kopy.io/yfL6O#XEMVNa3m1wotBU  This is what my code looks like.
[10:21:05] <taplar> map() is a function off of Array or jQuery
[10:21:16] <_TWG_> This is his example from yesterday. https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rvyvumt7/1/
[10:21:25] <_TWG_> map of an array
[10:22:02] <taplar> so it's complaining about currentObject.data.map.  have you tried console.log(currentObject.data) to see what it is?
[10:22:52] <_TWG_> I just did.  Ot
[10:23:01] <_TWG_> It's sending back an Object.
[10:23:17] <taplar> not an array?
[10:23:24] <_TWG_> Evidently not
[10:23:30] <taplar> so map is not valid there
[10:24:04] <_TWG_> Let me post up what my code is doing to take the CSV and move it to an array.
[10:25:21] <_TWG_> taplar: http://kopy.io/zbxI6#XT9er7qGgpvycH
[10:26:32] <taplar> ok, so how does "tempData" in the first link relate to the second link?
[10:27:20] <_TWG_> LOL, let me make a fiddle.  I don't know why I keep using kopy.io
[10:28:38] <taplar> because you have tempData and it looks like your trying to access some data on it, which isn't in the expected format.  so it's more of a question of what format is it actually in, so you can change your access logic
[10:31:26] <_TWG_> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/z8of1tty/
[10:32:06] <taplar> oh snap dude
[10:32:16] <taplar> you can't return a value from done()
[10:32:39] <taplar> your data when your trying to do that is the deferred object
[10:32:53] <taplar> you can't think like that, it's not synchronous
[10:33:08] <_TWG_> okay.  What do I need to do instead?  Still learning javascript/jQuery
[10:33:23] <taplar> you need to assign the value to the element inside the done
[10:34:16] <_TWG_> I don't quite understand taplar
[10:34:19] <taplar> hold on
[10:35:03] <_TWG_> okay
[10:36:15] <taplar> something like this possibly https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/1/
[10:37:05] <taplar> moved the csv call to right after the tempData declaration
[10:37:36] <_TWG_> Okay.  So where do I call getCSV to put the data into the data spot for each month?
[10:38:05] <taplar> You would have to do something similar for each call to get the csv data
[10:38:22] <taplar> so are you going to do this for every month?
[10:39:28] <_TWG_> Yes.  We have a third party company that is dumping a CSV file daily to our web server for each month.  I need to have my code query each month if it exists and display the data.  If it doesn't exist I need to show a field saying that the data is not available yet.
[10:39:40] <hellyeah> taplar: i am reading you
[10:39:43] <taplar> ok, one sec
[10:40:34] <hellyeah> i have approximately 15 mins :D
[10:40:36] <hellyeah> :D
[10:40:54] <taplar> not you, i'm working on TWG's issue for the moment
[10:41:25] <hellyeah> okey ii will try to join late evening tho
[10:41:28] <hellyeah> thanks
[10:41:30] <taplar> short answer for you hellyeah, a overlay is an element that is absolutely positioned and takes up 100% width and height and has a z-index that places it above all the page content
[10:41:35] <taplar> so it intercepts any clicks
[10:41:37] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:41:46] <hellyeah> ah z-index:2
[10:41:50] <hellyeah> you mean right
[10:42:17] <hellyeah> height:100% width:100% position:absolute and z-index:2
[10:42:25] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[10:43:18] <_TWG_> as long as that z-index is higher than all content behind it, yes that is correct.
[10:43:45] <hellyeah> z-index of element is 1 by default right
[10:44:23] <taplar> ok _TWG_ https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/2/
[10:45:28] <taplar> that will loop through your months, doing the csv call for each and loading their results into your array.  however it may not be sorted in the order you expect (since it's asynchronously loading) so if you want them in a specific order you'd have to sort it, or look them up in the order you want
[10:46:28] <_TWG_> Okay.  Thanks so much for the help.
[10:46:40] <taplar> sure
[10:46:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:46:58] <hellyeah> taplar: am i correct so far?
[10:47:13] <taplar> default z index iirc is 0
[10:47:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:47:36] <taplar> but you don't have to worry that much, just make your overlay like 100
[10:48:11] <taplar> so your overlay would be over your body, and your dialog would be over your overlay
[10:48:23] <taplar> when you show the dialog, show the overlay, and close it when you close the dialog
[10:49:28] <hellyeah> yes that what i tried to do
[10:49:44] <hellyeah> close overlay?
[10:49:51] <taplar> hide() it
[10:50:04] <hellyeah> ah okey
[10:50:33] <hellyeah> ah
[10:50:40] <hellyeah> i saw the picture entirely now
[10:50:46] <hellyeah> i will check it when i get home
[10:50:51] <hellyeah> that could be nice
[10:52:31] <taplar> if your concerned about tabbing you could also do something about those, but we can talk about that after the overlay is working, :)
[10:54:11] <_TWG_> templar I'm still getting a blank page.  When I console.log(tempData); immediately after the months.forEach, it gives me a blank []
[10:54:19] <_TWG_> taplar
[10:54:29] <taplar> it's asynchronous, not all the calls may have finished yet
[10:54:59] <taplar> do a console log as like the last line of your done
[10:55:02] <hellyeah> taplar: have a nice day
[10:55:06] <hellyeah> thanks for information
[10:55:07] <taplar> hellyeah:u2
[10:55:11] <_TWG_> How long will that take.  The singe CSV file that I have in there right now is only 64 lines long.
[10:55:27] <taplar> it depends on file size, network latency, etc.
[10:56:06] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I am using history state like so: http://pastie.org/10671442 - the URL does change and the content gets loaded in the div, and when I press back the browser url changes to the previous url, but the content that was loaded via .load() does not disappear, any idea how to achieve this?
[10:56:07] <_TWG_> 5KB file with a GB network.
[10:58:21] <Velveeta> _twg_: it doesn't matter how fast that connection is, the fact that it's an async request means it'll automatically get deferred to the next event loop at a minimum
[10:58:58] <Velveeta> so the synchronous code you're writing to interact with that data will encounter an empty data set every time, the same as if you wrapped the data collection in a setTimeout(0)
[10:59:04] <Uhkis> your cpu will always be faster at reading next line vs. network doing its thing
[10:59:11] <_TWG_> Okay.  Think I tracked down the issue. Looking in the console it shows an [Object] with data array.  The headers are stored in the first row of the Array and then the data starts afterwards.  Is it suppose to be that way taplar?
[10:59:43] <taplar> huh?
[10:59:49] <taplar> paste in here one of the consoles
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> [Object, Object]
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> 0: Object
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> 1: Object
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> active: ""
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> data: Array[61]
[11:01:32] <_TWG_> 0: Array[6]
[11:01:33] <_TWG_> 0: "Date"
[11:01:33] <_TWG_> 1: "Contract_Number"
[11:01:34] <_TWG_> 2: "Vendor"
[11:01:35] <_TWG_> 3: "Value"
[11:01:35] <_TWG_> 4: "Description"
[11:01:35] <_TWG_> 5: "Procurement_Method"
[11:01:36] <_TWG_> length: 6
[11:01:37] <_TWG_> __proto__: Array[0]
[11:01:59] <taplar> uh, crack open the 0: Object
[11:02:00] <Velveeta> _twg_: something like this should work better for you: https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/3/ using $.when with an array of promises to make sure all of your requests have completed before trying to map over them
[11:02:03] <_TWG_> There are an additional 60 data records below that one
[11:02:42] <Velveeta> er, sorry, that should be $.when.apply, let me correct it
[11:02:57] <Velveeta> there we go: https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/4/
[11:03:00] <taplar> yeah, if your wanting to delay until they're all done your going to have to use when
[11:04:37] <_TWG_> Okay.  I'm getting a promises is not defined
[11:04:56] <taplar> you included ln 6?
[11:04:56] <_TWG_> Nevermind, forgot to declare it
[11:05:33] <taplar> Velveeta:btw, glad you got that. i don't use it that often so every time i have to refigure out how to use apply, :D
[11:06:00] <Velveeta> then it was a perfect storm of not-very-oftens, because i don't pop up in here very often anymore either :D
[11:06:18] <taplar> i also think i usually try to mistakenly use call also
[11:06:22] <Velveeta> mostly i'm just procrastinating about getting out of bed right now :D
[11:06:31] <_TWG_> So on rendering, are we talking seconds, minutes, or hours?
[11:06:49] <taplar> if it's minutes, you have some network issues
[11:06:51] <Velveeta> _twg_: there's also an extra semicolon in that fiddle , no line 13 of the js section
[11:07:05] <Velveeta> yeah, rendering should still only take milliseconds
[11:07:30] <Velveeta> but you're now forcing the js interpreter to wait those few extra milliseconds until everything is loaded and ready
[11:08:07] <_TWG_> Velveeta: okay, for some reason it still is not populating my table for December.
[11:08:58] <taplar> ok, so lets start debugging again.  put a console.log before and inside the if for the december set
[11:09:06] <taplar> see what it's getting and if it is matching
[11:09:26] <taplar> sorry, not the set, the comparison
[11:10:29] <_TWG_> I have a console.log right after my $('#decReport tbody') and then another inside the if(currentObject.name) and neither are firing.
[11:10:58] <taplar> ok, console.log($('#decReport tbody').length);
[11:11:36] <_TWG_> inside of itself or outside?
[11:11:42] <taplar> before
[11:12:44] <_TWG_> Returns 1
[11:12:48] <sigdk> I would highly appreciate it if someone could help me fix the problem when switching from the first tab to 2nd or 3rd and then back to the first: https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/51/
[11:13:28] <taplar> hmm, so it exists.  can you update your fiddle with what you have now?
[11:13:49] <_TWG_> Sure, give me just a second
[11:14:24] <jak2000> hi all
[11:14:50] <_TWG_> https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/z8of1tty/6/ taplar
[11:14:59] <_TWG_> Velveeta thanks for the help
[11:15:11] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[11:15:16] <taplar> sigdk:your initializing the table for clicking tab1
[11:15:20] <arc_> sigdk it says you can't reinitialize datatable. so move the table initialization outside of the populateTabONE function
[11:15:21] <taplar> you only want to do that once
[11:16:47] <taplar> _TWG_:i think its cause it's using $.when() with an array
[11:16:58] <taplar> i thought Velveeta was changing it to use apply
[11:17:10] <sigdk> arc_, I want it there so it refreshes the contents whenever someone switches between tabs
[11:18:28] <_TWG_> taplar he did on v4.  I was looking at v3.  Just added it but it didn't make a difference
[11:18:54] <jak2000> hi taplar
[11:19:01] <taplar> hola
[11:19:01] <jak2000> can you see this video: https://youtu.be/G668tgSY3H0   pls
[11:19:30] <taplar> what is this video?
[11:21:22] <taplar> _TWG_:so you put the apply in like he had and if you do like console.log('hi') as the first line in the done you don't see it?
[11:21:35] <jak2000> if i add an alert it select the item on select/option, but if remove, not, here the jquery code: http://pastie.org/10671487  see line 18 (i am interested in lines: 63 to 67  any advice?
[11:21:56] <arc_> sigdk okay, but you can't initialize the table twice. there must be some way of loading new data into the table without initializing it
[11:22:04] <arc_> i don't know what that is, but it must exist
[11:22:15] <_TWG_> taplar I added the Hi console.log but it doesn't show in the console.
[11:22:27] <taplar> weird, :s
[11:24:29] <_TWG_> Leave it to me to have the weird occurrences.
[11:25:43] <jak2000> taplar see my problem?
[11:31:44] <taplar> gotta step away for a bit.  office stuff
[11:36:00] <_TWG_> Velveeta: My data is still not displaying.  I added a console.log('Hi!') right after the $.when.apply() but it never displays.
[11:36:20] <Velveeta> are you getting any errors in the console?
[11:36:59] <_TWG_> I get 11 404's because 11 of the files don't exist yet.
[11:37:27] <arc_> so wouldn't it go to error instead of done
[11:37:33] <Velveeta> well that's part of the problem
[11:37:50] <duch_kazatel> or .fail(), depending on what you're using.
[11:37:51] <Velveeta> yeah, the $.when function won't be executed until all promises are successfuly resolved
[11:38:20] <_TWG_> Okay.  There will be a point where all 12 files do not exist at the same time.
[11:38:37] <_TWG_> Hi duch_kazatel
[11:38:53] <jak2000> duch_kazatel friend
[11:38:58] <jak2000> can you see this video: https://youtu.be/G668tgSY3H0   pls
[11:39:02] <jak2000> if i add an alert it select the item on select/option, but if remove, not, here the jquery code: http://pastie.org/10671487  see line 18 (i am interested in lines: 63 to 67  any advice?
[11:39:02] <duch_kazatel> uh
[11:39:11] <duch_kazatel> no thanks.
[11:39:18] <_TWG_> lol
[11:39:22] <jak2000> :(
[11:39:28] <duch_kazatel> i don't watch videos of problems.
[11:39:58] <Velveeta> _twg_: in that case, you'll probably want to use .always() instead of .done()
[11:40:00] <duch_kazatel> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[11:40:33] <Velveeta> on the $.when promise
[11:40:48] <_TWG_> Velveeta: on the array creation or the table writer?
[11:40:56] <Velveeta> the table writer
[11:40:57] <_TWG_> okay. trying
[11:41:33] <_TWG_> Now the Hi fires.
[11:42:08] <Velveeta> and is the table output as expected?
[11:43:13] <jak2000> duch_kazatel, thanks, not know why when add an alert, it fill the select option and can select, the item, if remove the alert, cant select any option (on select/option control) because istn filled
[11:43:38] <_TWG_> Not yet.  Just inserted a console.log right after the $('#decReport tbody') and it's not showing so now I have an issue with it.
[11:43:43] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 i have no idea what you're talking about, but don't use alerts for debugging.
[11:43:59] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 read this.
[11:44:18] <Velveeta> _twg_ wanna post another updated fiddle?
[11:45:13] <_TWG_> Velveeta: https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/z8of1tty/8/
[11:49:27] <Velveeta> _twg_: https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/9/ seems to work ok when i substitute in some data in place of the ajax requests
[11:49:56] <Velveeta> i mean, i don't know the expected shape of that data, but if i return a resolved promise with a data object, it seems to function as expected
[11:53:52] <_TWG_> I just console.log(promises) and I get [Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object]
[11:54:02] <_TWG_> Is that how it should return?
[11:54:08] <duch_kazatel> right - you're looking at a bunch of interfaces.
[11:54:57] <Velveeta> yep
[11:55:38] <_TWG_> Okay.  When i expand the last one which happens to be December, my data is in responseText: ""Date","Contract_Number","Vendor","Value","Description","Procurement_Method"
[11:55:38] <_TWG_>  "12/02/2015","P0010000","Alert Services"," $401.77","","R0000001""
[11:55:52] <_TWG_> Is that correct as well?
[11:57:35] <Velveeta> if you're expanding the promise object, then yes
[11:58:01] <Velveeta> but at the time that $.when kicks off its callback, you shouldn't be dealing with the promises anymore, you should just be dealing with your tempData array
[11:59:16] <_TWG_> I just did the same console.log after the $.when.apply(this, promises) and get the same data
[12:00:03] <Velveeta> don't console.log after the $.when.apply, console.log inside of it
[12:00:19] <Velveeta> after it is processed immediately, inside of it is processed when all of the data is ready
[12:00:46] <_TWG_> sorry, it's on the first line inside of the $.when.
[12:01:13] <_TWG_> Everything looks the same as what I posted a minute ago.
[12:01:28] <Velveeta> and you're console.logging which value exactly?
[12:01:34] <Velveeta> currentObject?
[12:03:11] <_TWG_> This is my code snippet.  http://kopy.io/ypgWl#G7zMAFQGPt5CbS
[12:03:44] <Velveeta> yeah, you don't need to worry about promises at that point, just worry about your tempData array
[12:04:00] <Velveeta> althouuuuuugh, i can foresee one issue that might bite you in the ass
[12:04:29] <Velveeta> let me do a slight refactor to account for it
[12:05:05] <_TWG_> Just to let you know too that I have a console.log right inside the $('#decReport tbody') and it's not firing either.
[12:07:11] <Velveeta> it's firing on my side.. and if it's firing your console.log of the promises array, i can't think of any reason it wouldn't fire the one inside of that snippet unless it's either throwing an error or not matching that selector to anything
[12:07:31] <Velveeta> https://jsfiddle.net/z8of1tty/10/ will account for one flaw i saw in that promise setup
[12:08:15] <Velveeta> if you need all 12 months to be finished with their attempt to load, whether successfully or failed, then it needs to be reworked like this (just focus on lines 14 - 24)
[12:08:34] <Velveeta> because $.when will fire as soon as either all of them are successful, or the first one fails
[12:08:44] <_TWG_> Is it suppose to be promise.resolve or promises.resolve?
[12:08:56] <Velveeta> so if the first one fails before they're done loading, it'll kick off your tempData evaluation before all data is available
[12:09:05] <Velveeta> promise.resolce, singular
[12:09:11] <Velveeta> resolve*
[12:09:30] <jak2000> duch_kazatel i readed how to debug (i know before how todo it), but when debug the app, without the alert, the select/option is empty.... when finish load the page, the select/option have the options, any advice? exist a way for select the option, when select/option is finished filled?
[12:10:16] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 don't use alerts ever.
[12:10:23] <duch_kazatel> they halt execution and change the way things work.
[12:10:41] <jak2000> yes i know....
[12:11:00] <duch_kazatel> if you're waiting on ajax or something, you need to put your code inside the .done() callback of the ajax call.
[12:11:10] <jak2000> only write an alert for check other way
[12:11:16] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[12:11:24] <duch_kazatel> use console.log() instead.
[12:11:38] <_TWG_> well I guess this POC failed.
[12:11:49] <jak2000> ok
[12:12:26] <Velveeta> it shouldn't fail, you just need to properly debug it
[12:12:39] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:13:25] <Velveeta> it's like my lotto strategy, i'm still working out the correct Math.random() algorithm that governs when i get my ticket
[12:13:34] <_TWG_> Well I don't know how to since the issue is with the $('#decReport tbody').append(tempData.map(function(currentObject){ .  I try to console.log currentObject but it never fires.
[12:14:10] <Velveeta> so repaste your fiddle one mroe time with the latest
[12:14:19] <jak2000> duch_kazatel, Velveeta: plese see my code: http://pastie.org/10671487
[12:14:20] <_TWG_> And this POC is due as soon as I get back from lunch.
[12:14:39] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 that's 200 lines - that's not a standalone test case.
[12:14:43] <duch_kazatel> err, 81 lines.
[12:14:44] <Velveeta> and also, try adding a console.log for $('#decReport tbody).length
[12:14:45] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[12:14:52] <jak2000> duch_kazatel, yes i explain my logic please
[12:14:59] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 you tried this yesterday.
[12:15:02] <jak2000> yes
[12:15:11] <jak2000> see line 63: $('#xtarcmaquila option').each(function ()    ?
[12:15:12] <duch_kazatel> we can't see your data.
[12:15:14] <Velveeta> jak2000: i have no idea what i'm looking at
[12:15:23] <jak2000> escuse me
[12:15:29] <jak2000> line 63: $('#xembnomchof option').each(function () {
[12:15:44] <_TWG_> https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/z8of1tty/11/ Velveeta
[12:15:45] <jak2000> this select/option control was filled
[12:16:08] <jak2000> when i call the line 18: $('#xemblinea').change();
[12:16:18] <Velveeta> _twg_: you're not incorporating all the changes from fiddle #10
[12:16:28] <Velveeta> take a look at all of lines 14 - 24
[12:16:53] <Velveeta> particularly 14-16
[12:17:01] <Velveeta> er 17
[12:18:50] <_TWG_> Okay.  Now my table is filled but it is all undefined
[12:19:57] <Velveeta> ok, so in that case, it sounds like your data shape might be slightly off, so what does your console.log report for currentObject ?
[12:21:58] <_TWG_> So it writing my headers as the first line and then my data on all of the other lines.  I changed my return to use the [0], [1], etc.  I just need to tell it to ignore the first item as it is the headers.
[12:25:03] <Velveeta> so does changing it to use those indexes fix the problem?
[12:26:23] <_TWG_> Yes the data now shows when I use indexes.  Just sorting out how to hide the header
[12:26:34] <_TWG_> Thank you for all of your help.
[12:30:28] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[13:17:23] <dopie> hey all why am i getting an error on names ?
[13:17:24] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/9u9ywnyp/4/
[13:18:16] <duch_kazatel> .each() is a jquery function.
[13:18:18] <duch_kazatel> names is an array.
[13:18:36] <dopie> ahhhhh
[13:18:52] <dopie> so i would need to wrap names into $(names)
[13:18:52] <duch_kazatel> 2 things: don't prepend ID selectors with tags, and give those all a class to select on instead.
[13:18:57] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:19:02] <duch_kazatel> that still won't work the way you want it to.
[13:19:11] <duch_kazatel> you need a single jquery object, bot a collection of collections.
[13:19:17] <duch_kazatel> give those all a class and select that class instead.
[13:21:13] <dopie> give those all a class and select that class instead.
[13:21:19] <dopie> dont understand that
[13:21:29] <duch_kazatel> what about it doesn't make sense?
[13:21:39] <dopie> like an actuall class of foo ?
[13:21:49] <dopie> ok now i get it
[13:22:07] <civpro> im having issues trying to find the text inside of a combobox and selecting it.  I have tried many different methods but i suspect that my selection is getting overwritten later in my code, what is the best way using google chrome's console to be able to tell if it is?
[13:22:38] <civpro> i cannot do this by value, only by the text
[13:22:38] <duch_kazatel> use your step debugger civpro
[13:22:51] <civpro> let me reword
[13:23:00] <civpro> what is the command to find out what the current selected item is?
[13:23:09] <civpro> using the console
[13:23:10] <duch_kazatel> that statement doesn't make sense.
[13:23:18] <duch_kazatel> you mean the thing that currently has focus?
[13:23:39] <civpro> the combobox's current selected item
[13:23:50] <duch_kazatel> get the .val() of the combobox instead.
[13:23:58] <civpro> i figured if i placed the output in the code at some random spots i could see if its being set or not
[13:24:05] <civpro> ok, thanks
[13:24:50] <civpro> $(#cboTechs).val() is not working
[13:25:00] <duch_kazatel> then clarify your question.
[13:25:02] <civpro> cboTechs is the id of the combobox
[13:25:05] <duch_kazatel> something here isn't clicking.
[13:25:17] <duch_kazatel> you mean a dropdown?
[13:25:17] <civpro> i have a combobox with an id of cboTechs
[13:25:31] <civpro> what is the command in the console to get the current selected item
[13:25:49] <duch_kazatel> are you talking about a dropdown?
[13:25:52] <civpro> yes
[13:25:59] <duch_kazatel> the .val() will get you the value of a dropdown.
[13:26:15] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you can use .find() with :selected (I think)
[13:26:20] <duch_kazatel> but that's a strange thing to want to do.
[13:26:54] <civpro> im getting Unexpected token ILLEGAL when i try command $(#cboTechs).val()
[13:27:05] <duch_kazatel> because that's not valid JS.
[13:27:07] <civpro> Uncaught SyntaxError
[13:27:08] <duch_kazatel> you're missing quotes.
[13:27:12] <civpro> ah ok
[13:27:16] <civpro> that is what i was asking :)
[13:27:23] <akkufomk> well that's a given
[13:27:33] <duch_kazatel> it's safe to assume you understand basic js/jquery ;)
[13:27:40] <civpro> awesome
[13:27:51] <civpro> obviously that isnt safe to assume
[13:28:00] <civpro> joking, i just overlooked it
[13:28:13] <akkufomk> hrm.......  excuses
[13:28:26] <dopie> ok now why is name.on not a function?!
[13:28:27] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/9u9ywnyp/8/
[13:28:40] <duch_kazatel> dopie really?
[13:28:44] <duch_kazatel> you don't have a name.
[13:28:48] <duch_kazatel> you have names.
[13:29:10] <dopie> duh
[13:29:28] <dopie> but im calling names each
[13:29:31] <dopie> ontop of it
[13:29:39] <duch_kazatel> uh
[13:29:57] <duch_kazatel> name isn't a jquery object.
[13:30:11] <duch_kazatel> btw you don't need .each(*) for that.
[13:30:17] <dopie> ok
[13:30:27] <duch_kazatel> names.on() will work just fine.
[13:30:30] <duch_kazatel> it does the each for you.
[13:31:23] <dopie> so i need a $names.on()
[13:31:36] <duch_kazatel> you already have a jquery object in names.
[13:36:38] <dopie> hmmmmm
[13:38:37] <dopie> ok...
[13:38:47] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/pares101/9u9ywnyp/9/
[13:39:02] <dopie> now if i enter my middle name first or last name first it throws an TypeError
[13:39:03] <duch_kazatel> what's your question?
[13:39:13] <dopie> a
[13:39:28] <dopie> an = a
[13:39:42] <duch_kazatel> uh
[13:39:47] <dopie> what?
[13:39:50] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to get the name of the thing that was changed?>
[13:40:07] <duch_kazatel> because this code doesn't make any sense.
[13:40:25] <dopie> this is what im trying to do
[13:40:52] <dopie> user puts a value in the box i get the value, get the first letter of it, uppercase it and than do soemhting with it i just have console log to see if it works
[13:41:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah your code doesn't make sense.
[13:41:17] <dopie> Ok how would you write it than?
[13:42:07] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9u9ywnyp/10/
[13:45:00] <dopie> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help, i have a question why did you add a comma after setting the $('.user-name') ?
[13:45:18] <duch_kazatel> notice how i'm setting two variables?
[13:45:45] <dopie> you setting getName as a variable?
[13:45:51] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:46:14] <jeffreylevesque> how long would it take a UI/UX developer to come up with a mockup similar to http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/?
[13:46:30] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque wrong channel to ask in.
[13:46:43] <dopie> jeffreylevesque: defintely wrong channel and it shouldnt take more than a few hours
[13:47:05] <jeffreylevesque> including wireframe, and maybe the necessary stock photos?
[13:47:14] <dopie> correct
[13:47:33] <duch_kazatel> please take this conversation elsewhere.
[13:47:35] <duch_kazatel> thanks!
[13:58:20] <civpro> is there a way to setup jsfiddle to accept url parameters?
[13:58:32] <duch_kazatel> that that i'm aware of.
[14:00:06] <Dirkos> I have added dynamic content to a page. But the load event is never triggered
[14:00:06] <Dirkos> $('#program_'+self.id).on('load', function(){
[14:00:14] <duch_kazatel> uh
[14:00:20] <Dirkos> how can i ensure that it is loaded (like all images present etc)
[14:00:27] <duch_kazatel> 2 things:
[14:00:36] <duch_kazatel> 1: you can't bind to things that don't yet exist.
[14:00:43] <duch_kazatel> 2: you want the window load event.
[14:00:52] <duch_kazatel> but that's sketch at best - only good for the initial pageload.
[14:00:52] <Dirkos> Well it exists when triggering this
[14:01:04] <duch_kazatel> the load event is often misunderstood.
[14:01:15] <Dirkos> yeahh shall i explain a bit what im building
[14:01:20] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[14:01:21] <Dirkos> Im loading a slideshow with different pages
[14:01:29] <Dirkos> I want the page to be fully rendered before showing it
[14:01:33] <duch_kazatel> start with the window load event.
[14:01:48] <Dirkos> same result
[14:02:20] <duch_kazatel> then there's something else going on.
[14:02:23] <akkufomk> Dirkos: just hang a trigger at the end of your load to fire a display css change
[14:02:46] <Dirkos> akkufomk: im trying but im never ending in the function itself
[14:02:49] <duch_kazatel> the load event handler for images only fires if you manage to bind it between creating the element and before the image loads, which requires a lot of wrangling.
[14:02:52] <Dirkos> So he tells me the load never finished
[14:03:17] <duch_kazatel> why do you want to wait until the page is done loading?
[14:03:20] <akkufomk> Dirkos: got a pastie?
[14:03:33] <Dirkos> akkufomk: not really since its alot of code and different objects
[14:03:47] <Dirkos> duch_kazatel: i dont want to start an image slideshow when the pictures are not there yet
[14:04:25] <duch_kazatel> fwiw slideshows are generally frowned upon, especially ones that automatically advance.
[14:04:47] <RenokK> ^this
[14:04:57] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:05:18] <akkufomk> ROFL
[14:05:20] <akkufomk> Nice duch_kazatel
[14:05:24] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:05:45] <Dirkos> Yeah but i want it to auto refresh as well, thats the main reason
[14:05:49] <Dirkos> atleast, its an requirement
[14:05:53] <duch_kazatel> "auto refresh"?
[14:06:14] <Dirkos> Its a slideshow, fullscreen on a TV
[14:06:46] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question, but ok.
[14:06:56] <Dirkos> If they want to add images from the backend they should reflect on the slideshow after x time. Im using an ajax call to retrieve the HTML and i store it in queue div which is hidden
[14:07:10] <Dirkos> when all that is done loading (like window load) i want to stop the slideshow and load the new data
[14:07:17] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:07:20] <duch_kazatel> that's not how that works.
[14:07:27] <duch_kazatel> you're in the window load and wrangling things awkwardly.
[14:07:51] <duch_kazatel> you have the initial window load and then you have to dynamically create image tags and add listeners before appending them to the document and setting their source.
[14:08:01] <civpro> i cant get the simple dropdownlist to change
[14:08:37] <civpro> $('select').val($("select option:contains('Person1')").val());
[14:08:41] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:08:49] <civpro> shouldnt that update the dropdownlist to the selected person?
[14:08:50] <duch_kazatel> (make a fiddle, yo)
[14:08:54] <civpro> or is there a better way
[14:08:57] <civpro> ok
[14:09:06] <dopie> duch_kazatel: man im here staring at your code its awesome , what do you recommend on being a jquery/js master?? any tutorials or classes????
[14:09:20] <dopie> I'm obviously starting out
[14:09:32] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/5tcbpx8x/1/
[14:09:33] <duch_kazatel> dopie mdn, jquery learning center, javascript: the good parts, and lots of practice.
[14:09:43] <dopie> duch_kazatel: thanks
[14:09:46] <civpro> all i am trying to do is change the selected item in the dropdownlist
[14:09:58] <duch_kazatel> civpro uh... this doesn't have what you were talking about.
[14:10:25] <duch_kazatel> but https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5tcbpx8x/2/
[14:11:44] <civpro> oh crap, i forgot to copy it in the onload
[14:11:46] <civpro> 1 second
[14:11:55] <duch_kazatel> civpro you don't need it on load.
[14:11:58] <duch_kazatel> document ready should be fine.
[14:13:12] <Dirkos> duch_kazatel: can you explain me why this works?
[14:13:12] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/DLy6j/
[14:13:59] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:14:09] <duch_kazatel> tryu rephrasing that question ;)
[14:14:32] <Dirkos> Well over there you can have a message waiting untill the image is loaded
[14:14:41] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/5tcbpx8x/5/
[14:14:50] <duch_kazatel> what part are you specifically asking about, Dirkos?
[14:15:01] <duch_kazatel> you're assuming i understand your knowledge level.
[14:15:02] <duch_kazatel> i don't.
[14:15:13] <duch_kazatel> civpro i already showed you how to do this.
[14:15:25] <duch_kazatel> civpro also, you're missing a closing );
[14:15:28] <hellyeah> taplar: you still there?
[14:15:41] <taplar> kinda sorta.  working on some stuff.  sup?
[14:16:28] <civpro> ok, ill update
[14:16:38] <hellyeah> why do you suggest overlay?
[14:16:41] <civpro> how to do the selected item?
[14:16:49] <duch_kazatel> civpro ... huh?
[14:16:56] <hellyeah> civpro: wut
[14:17:06] <duch_kazatel> civpro i already showed you how to set the value for a dropdown.
[14:17:07] <hellyeah> civpro: fiddle?
[14:17:07] <taplar> an overlay will block the user from clicking on your elements until you want them to be able to
[14:17:19] <taplar> so all that talk about disabling events temporarily isn't necessary
[14:17:34] <hellyeah> taplar: but my suggestion also work right?
[14:17:41] <taplar> like i said, it's heavy handed
[14:17:52] <civpro> hellyeah, yes, https://jsfiddle.net/5tcbpx8x/6/
[14:17:55] <hellyeah> performance?
[14:18:03] <taplar> no, logically
[14:18:06] <duch_kazatel> civpro what are you confused about?
[14:18:10] <taplar> why undo and redo stuff when you can just prevent it
[14:18:23] <hellyeah> ic
[14:18:28] <civpro> ok so i know the text, i do not know the value, how can i set the dropdownlist by the text
[14:18:31] <duch_kazatel> civpro also, your code is still invalid.
[14:18:39] <hellyeah> civpro: what do you weant exactly seems it is working
[14:18:41] <taplar> there are two ways to solve a problem
[14:18:48] <taplar> solve it, or keep it from happening in the first place
[14:18:54] <duch_kazatel> civpro also, you still don't have jquery in that fiddle.
[14:19:07] <hellyeah> taplar: take the inituitive then
[14:19:10] <hellyeah> :D
[14:19:16] <taplar> don't solve self made problems
[14:19:17] <duch_kazatel> civpro https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5tcbpx8x/7/
[14:19:20] <taplar> stop making the problem
[14:20:08] <civpro> yes working now
[14:20:13] <taplar> unless it's a necessary problem, but in general
[14:20:21] <civpro> thanks
[14:21:00] <duch_kazatel> civpro fix your code and add jquery - it helps ;)
[14:21:06] <hellyeah> taplar: souÄ±nds like decent philosophy for life
[14:24:05] <taplar> what's that old joke?  guy goes to the doctor and says it hurts when i hit myself.  and the doctor says, stop hitting yourself.
[14:26:07] <akkufomk> I sit in a corner and travel around the world.  What am I?
[14:26:18] <duch_kazatel> my dreams

[14:30:33] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah yeah - the travel from home to work and back.
[14:30:44] <duch_kazatel> shai3411 those are probably async functions.
[14:30:50] <_TWG_> can I pick you brain real quick dutch_
[14:31:00] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel:
[14:31:01] <duch_kazatel> *duch, and just ask your question.
[14:31:04] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[14:31:07] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will :)

[14:31:42] <_TWG_> Okay.  So I have an array.  How can I check if the data index is empty/null?
[14:31:45] <hellyeah> DeltaHeavy: me
[14:31:47] <hellyeah> ?
[14:31:49] <DeltaHeavy> [14:27:30] hellyeah:	asdasdjajsdjasd              Dat quality contribution
[14:31:52] <DeltaHeavy> Yes you :p
[14:32:16] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ "the data index"?
[14:32:32] <hellyeah> DeltaHeavy: all of the blame did not belong to me DeltaHeavy
[14:33:03] <duch_kazatel> take it to PM fellas.
[14:33:04] <duch_kazatel> thanks.
[14:33:07] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:33:10] <hellyeah> :D,
[14:33:29] <hellyeah> DeltaHeavy: i contributed the channel sometimes if i am able
[14:33:36] <duch_kazatel> again, take it to PM.
[14:33:40] <shai3411> duch_kazatel: is there some trick how to get the information from this async functions?
[14:33:46] <hellyeah> :XD
[14:33:50] * DeltaHeavy head explodes
[14:33:57] <_TWG_> I have an array nested into another array with an index called data.
[14:34:02] <duch_kazatel> shai3411 the data doesn't exist until after the callbacks execute.
[14:34:04] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel
[14:34:15] <hellyeah> _TWG_: small chunks of array
[14:34:26] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ that's... not an array then.
[14:34:35] <duch_kazatel> you have an object in an array.
[14:34:44] <duch_kazatel> show me an example.
[14:34:53] <_TWG_> Sorry it's the other way around it's an object with an array inside of it
[14:35:01] <duch_kazatel> show me an example of the data.
[14:35:26] <_TWG_> give me two seconds
[14:38:50] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: http://kopy.io/B27b3#L656wgkalRLabn
[14:39:01] <duch_kazatel> uh
[14:39:05] <duch_kazatel> this isn't valid json.
[14:39:45] <_TWG_> I'm trying to copy it out of my inspector so I might have gotten it wrong.
[14:40:12] <civpro> ok so it looks like my dropdownlist value is null at document.ready
[14:40:22] <civpro> is there another status i can use that will run later?
[14:40:32] <duch_kazatel> window load./
[14:40:38] <duch_kazatel> what populates the dropdown?
[14:40:44] <civpro> window.load
[14:40:56] <civpro> i was thinking it was the reverse
[14:41:00] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cbnq92w/ this is probably what it should be.
[14:41:09] <duch_kazatel> civpro document ready just means things are basically available.
[14:41:17] <civpro> gotcha
[14:41:20] <duch_kazatel> window load means that all your assets have loaded - the document can be ready before that.
[14:41:26] <civpro> ok ill switch them around
[14:41:28] <duch_kazatel> so what populates the dropdown?
[14:41:36] <duch_kazatel> because waiting until window load is code smell.
[14:41:46] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: yes.  Sorry.  I was trying my best to copy the data over using the console.
[14:41:50] <civpro> im going to try to reverse them
[14:41:56] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ so what are you trying to do here?
[14:42:01] <civpro> thanks again
[14:42:08] <duch_kazatel> civpro uh... 'kay.
[14:42:31] <_TWG_> I need to do two checks.  I need to see if the data is null/empty and then I need to ignore the header index of 0.
[14:43:09] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ is there ever a case data will actually be null?
[14:43:48] <_TWG_> Yes.  If my file does not exist yet.  The file will appear the month after it happens.
[14:43:57] <duch_kazatel> that's... gross.
[14:44:04] <duch_kazatel> server should return an empty array.
[14:44:14] <duch_kazatel> either way, you can see if (data && data.length) {
[14:44:27] <duch_kazatel> what is "the header index of 0"?
[14:44:30] <_TWG_> Okay.  What's gross?
[14:44:40] <duch_kazatel> avoid returning null.
[14:44:42] <duch_kazatel> return an empty array.
[14:44:50] <duch_kazatel> then use .forEach()
[14:44:53] <_TWG_> Okay.
[14:45:14] <duch_kazatel> and i assume you mean you need to ignore the 0th index of data?
[14:45:19] <duch_kazatel> since it looks like it's a header row, right?
[14:45:27] <_TWG_> That is correct
[14:45:32] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[14:45:35] <duch_kazatel> fix your data first.
[14:45:40] <civpro> still getting null for val
[14:45:53] <civpro> i cant seem to figure out where its getting set at
[14:45:54] <duch_kazatel> civpro what is populating that dropdown?
[14:46:08] <civpro> its an api call, names and values
[14:46:16] <duch_kazatel> then you need to be in the .done() callback.
[14:46:23] <civpro> ah ok
[14:46:33] <civpro> ill try that
[14:46:42] <civpro> you do the done on the dropdownlist correct?
[14:46:51] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:46:54] <duch_kazatel> on the ajax call.
[14:47:02] <civpro> ok
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cbnq92w/1/
[14:47:41] <duch_kazatel> civpro anything that relies on that ajax call being completed needs to be in the .done() callback of that ajax call.
[14:48:01] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help.  Gotta run to a meeting but I will try it out as soon as I get back.
[14:48:07] <duch_kazatel> 'kay
[14:49:32] <civpro> thanks
[14:51:41] <duch_kazatel> civpro then show me your code or give mre something to work with.,
[14:51:47] <duch_kazatel> woops
[14:51:52] <duch_kazatel> i was scrolled up - my bad hahahaha
[14:54:06] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: that code worked.  Now my headers have gone away.
[14:54:50] <duch_kazatel> that was more to demonstrate the idea, but cool.
[14:55:07] <duch_kazatel> i'd .filter() out before writing it out instead of mutating your data, but mhe.
[14:55:10] <duch_kazatel> *meh
[14:56:41] <_TWG_> what do you mean?
[14:58:51] <duch_kazatel> instead of changing all of your data like that.
[15:33:18] <bfvasfg> Is this quote "<srm`> you don't even know what we know to develop a datamapper with raw sql" referring to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern
[15:33:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:33:39] <duch_kazatel> bfvasfg wrong channel?
[15:33:45] <bfvasfg> Sorry about that.
[15:33:54] <duch_kazatel> all good :)
[15:54:53] <joakimk> I'm playing around with http://seegatesite.com/bootstrap/simple_sidebar_menu.html and trying to make the menu item, <li class="active">, be expanded on page load. In the corresponding sidebar_menu.js file, it does $('#menu ul').hide(); So I try to add $('#menu ul > li.active').show(); but I guess I'm getting the CSS selector wrong?
[16:02:08] <joakimk> The menu is <ul id="menu"> where each entry (li) may contain a sub-menu, as a nested <ul>. So $('#menu ul').hide() somehow hides all the *submenus*. How does that work? I would have expected $('#menu ul').hide() to hide the entire <ul id="menu">...
[16:02:33] <joakimk> ah, nevermind. #menu ul is not the same as ul#menu
[16:04:52] <joakimk> so $('#menu ul').hide() hides all the <ul> nested within <ul id="menu">. That makes sense. So if I want to show a particular submenu, I could give it an id, say id="me", and do, $('#menu ul#me').show()
[16:06:42] <joakimk> however, the active menu item is: <ul id="menu"><li>not this</li><li class="active">but this</li></ul>. How do I target the sub-menu (ul) inside <li class="active">?
[16:08:02] <joakimk> hehe, is $('#menu .active ul').show(); correct?

[16:33:34] <seemikehack> Hey all, where's my checkbox? http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/mVWRNa
[16:36:53] <civpro> ok so i got a wierd bug
[16:37:07] <civpro> i have parameters set in my url to allow for static type values on the page
[16:37:13] <civpro> one controls a radio box
[16:37:40] <civpro> on window load i say if the parameter is set then click it
[16:37:57] <civpro> problem is if i click the other option on the page then it goes back to the original one
[16:38:04] <civpro> what is the best way of approaching this?
[17:28:19] <moonman> how do you select with jquert?
[17:30:37] <Kamuela> moonman: $("element-here")
[17:30:41] <akkufomk> seemikehack: that's some messy shit
[17:32:54] <moonman> what i mean to ask was how do you replace a class name
[17:33:10] <moonman> like class="name"
[17:33:26] <_TWG_> $('.name')
[17:33:46] <_TWG_> $('
[17:33:58] <_TWG_> $('#name').toggle()
[17:34:48] <moonman> like from class="name" to class="hello"

[17:36:14] <Davey> So, I've written a jquery plugin but I'm not happy with it. Are there any decent resources that show best practices for complicated plugins? I want things like complex options, custom events, etc
[17:36:31] <Davey> I think it might actually be better to do it as a jquery UI widget
[17:45:00] <akkufomk> Davey:  I have created a jQuery Page object that I inherit from most of my code
[17:45:04] <akkufomk> Davey: http://pastebin.com/e61xpxRd
[17:45:17] <akkufomk> Davey: it's got it's own messaging system in it
[17:45:43] <akkufomk> Davey: Just attach all your widgets in the addPageEvents and you're good to go
[17:48:50] <akkufomk> Davey: Here's an example http://pastebin.com/ibUTfW9A
[18:14:03] <scrndddy> hey there. is there a way to test if a url is "mixed content" by one of the callbacks in $.get?
[18:14:44] <scrndddy> mixed content doesn't seem to show as a numbered status code in chrome, i only see "(blocked:mixed-content)" as the status in the network tab
[18:20:08] <akkufomk> scrndddy: if it's originally an https link you can .each() all elements and recurse down and check to see if it's got http values otherwise it's the opposite
[18:24:52] <scrndddy> akkufomk: hmm, that could work. what about just checking if it's blocked? any way to do that with jquery?
[18:29:33] <akkufomk> nah the browser will block it before your script runs
[18:29:42] <akkufomk> to my understanding
[18:35:09] <scrndddy> fair enough, thank you
[18:43:35] <huck5> is there a version of .appendTo() that replaces the content?
[18:43:45] <huck5> Aside fomr .html() i mean
[18:45:51] <akkufomk> huck5: http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[18:46:39] <huck5> akkufomk, thank you!

[23:28:35] <shibly> What's wrong with this code? https://jsfiddle.net/68sahepe/ , change event is not working
[23:40:42] <arc_> shibly first of all, the tag name of those elements is 'input'. to select by the name attribute in javascript, you need to use .querySelectorAll('[name=nm_radio_select_service]');
[23:54:33] <arc_> shibly second of all, .addEventListener() works on one element. when you use a method that returns a nodelist, you cannot use .addEventListener() to bind a listener to all of those elements simultaneously. you have to iterate over them
[23:55:26] <arc_> jquery makes this much easier.
