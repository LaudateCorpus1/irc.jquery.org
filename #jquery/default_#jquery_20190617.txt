[01:02:28] <ekiro> thx
[01:23:26] <ekiro> i have a pie chart as a progress bar. i want to make it so when i hover over it it will be be replaced with a cancel button. when you hover away the cancel button dissapears and the progress graph reapears with updated progress (it would have updated while you hovered over it and the cancel button showed).  im wondering what the best way to do this? i know i have to use hover(), but then to hide and show the chart/cancel button
[01:23:26] <ekiro> should i use toggle and should i have the html in place or have JS insert that stuff?
[01:47:44] <Cork> ekiro: i would recommed havig both the elemets i the dom at the same time
[01:48:01] <Cork> ad the togglig betwee them usign a class on the parent element
[01:48:18] <Cork> that way the code that updates the progressbar doesn't have to know the state
[01:48:37] <Cork> (is the bar there or not)
[02:05:50] <ekiro> i see
[02:05:58] <ekiro> is there a way to merge these two lines into one?
[02:05:59] <ekiro>         	$('#uploaderFile' + id).find('.spinner').replaceWith('<div class="chart" data-percent="0"></div>');
[02:05:59] <ekiro>         	var progress = $('#uploaderFile' + id).find('.chart').hide().fadeIn();
[02:14:14] <Cork> not really, as you do find('.spinner') and .find('.chart')
[02:14:29] <Cork> you can do .end(), but it will be doig the same thing so no real gai
[02:14:31] <Cork> +n
[02:40:59] <ekiro> i see thx
[02:43:51] <ekiro> also another issue i am having is that when i click on the cancel button it gets clicked multiple times. sometimes even 10 times with one click. not sure why this is happening. here is a snippit of the code: https://bpaste.net/show/b71c7d8c5552
[02:45:08] <Cork> ekiro: do you have multiple elements nested in each other with the class .file-title?
[02:46:02] <ekiro> no
[02:46:48] <ekiro> https://bpaste.net/show/17c82ee3771d this is my html
[02:46:56] <Robdgreat> ekiro: it would be helpful if you could put it in a fiddle
[02:48:03] <Cork> ekiro: the only thing left i can guess at is that you run the .on('click') multiple times on the same dom elements
[02:49:33] <ekiro> hmm i noticed that if i move in and out of the html block many times, then click, it gets clicked the number of times i entered/left
[02:49:48] <ekiro> if i enter once, then click it only clicks once
[02:52:02] <ekiro> seems to have something to do with hover/mouseenter/mouseleave
[02:54:19] <ekiro> ok solved it
[02:54:30] <ekiro> needed to use .off() in mouseleave()
[02:54:38] <ekiro> to remove previously attached event handler
[02:55:10] <ekiro> srry for the noob questions. just started using jquery for the first time yesterday and i need to get something done quick :)
[02:55:44] <ekiro> but jquery seems really fun to build some cool UIs
[08:51:42] <pfm> hi all, quick question that is really hard to google (what is the jquery source file character encoding?)
[08:52:11] <pfm> im getting a script error in a legacy version of IE
[08:52:24] <pfm> that complains about jquery-1.9.1.min.js having an invalid character
[08:52:42] <pfm> i think its to do with the way the file is being served
[08:53:05] <pfm> i checked jquery-1.9.1.min.js in a hex editor and it definetely doesnt have a UTF-8 BOM
[08:53:13] <pfm> so it should be all ANSI right?
[08:53:34] <Cork> gf3: most js libs from the last many years use utf-8 for encoding
[08:53:49] <Cork> and ie post 4 shouldn't have problem with that
[09:01:53] <pfm> i thought as much but trying to hit the url in firefox dev tools i get this warning
[09:01:54] <pfm> https://imgur.com/a/HPxjaq6
[09:02:32] <pfm> but i dont controll this server (however i have check that file against the one on the official jquery cdn and they are identicall)
[09:02:50] <pfm> so its definetely being caused by a server config issue
[09:03:08] <pfm> when i hit the jquery cdn for the same file i get no problem or warning
[09:06:06] <pfm> this is the error in IE https://imgur.com/a/ngntzyx
[09:07:34] <pfm> i suspect the browser is interpreting the file as ANSI but somewhere in the jquery source there are characters that are not ANSI (because the file is encoded in UTF-8)
[09:37:09] <bestdesign> hi
[09:37:30] <bestdesign> how make two .css into one like this
[09:37:42] <bestdesign> 	$('#front').css('max-height', $('.div_test_az').height() * 4 + 'px');
[09:37:44] <bestdesign> 	$('#front').css('min-height', $('.div_test_az').height() * 2 + 'px');
[09:37:58] <bestdesign> i want to combine both in one .css
[09:38:29] <Cork> var div = $('.div_test_az').height(); $('#front').css({ 'min-height': div, 'max-height': div });
[09:39:02] <Cork> alternatively var div = $('.div_test_az').height(); $('#front').css({ minHeight: div, maxHeight: div });
[09:39:32] <bestdesign> wow Cork thank you
[09:40:18] <bestdesign> ^^
[09:40:20] <Cork> bestdesign: http://api.jquery.com/css/#css-properties
[09:41:01] <bestdesign> Cork: yes I saw that but you do with a var that .height so no need to repeat :) great solutions
[14:46:08] <railsnoob> I have a button that when pressed, creates more elements. I can't however dynamically bind events to them. How do I do this? Here is my js fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/9gaev3L4/
[14:46:25] <bestdesign> hi
[14:46:38] <railsnoob> Hello
[14:46:41] <robertmaxrees> railsnoob you want delegated handlers :)
[14:46:47] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:47:08] <bestdesign> how go get a div height and set it to its container as min-height with jQuerY?
[14:47:14] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:47:28] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign huh?
[14:47:37] <railsnoob> robertmaxrees I looked into that, but doesn't that meant that the remove button can't be dynamically created?
[14:48:06] <robertmaxrees> railsnoob if you read the entire thing, it explains that the button can indeed be dynamically created.
[14:48:06] <railsnoob> From the page "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist at the time your code makes the call to .on(). "
[14:48:12] <robertmaxrees> right, keep reading :)
[14:48:20] <railsnoob> Ok, thanks
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> "Delegated event handlers have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time."
[14:49:14] <railsnoob> Haha thanks, I should've read what was literally a sentence away. Thank you!
[14:49:19] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[14:53:36] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/38x6d7mp/
[14:53:43] <bestdesign> is possible?
[14:53:58] <robertmaxrees> what is tststs supposed to be?
[14:54:07] <bestdesign> content text
[14:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean ststs ?>
[14:54:39] <bestdesign> oh a typo
[14:54:42] <bestdesign> but yes
[14:55:09] <robertmaxrees> why are you using jquery to do this in the first place?
[14:55:19] <bestdesign> how can get the ststs height as pixel ? and set it as min=height to #test id?
[14:56:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:56:07] <robertmaxrees> you're doing it there.
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the issue is...
[14:56:29] <robertmaxrees> is it doing something wrong?
[14:57:21] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: my problem with it is not get height as pixel?
[14:57:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean it's coming back as a number?
[14:58:15] <bestdesign> yes
[14:58:20] <bestdesign> just a number not like 500px
[14:58:31] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually append 'px' yourself.
[14:58:45] <bestdesign> hmm
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:01:02] <bestdesign> just thinking :)
[15:01:07] <bestdesign> btw thanks
[15:01:17] <robertmaxrees> why not just fix your CSS to do the right thing?
[15:01:38] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: with css is only do pre definied value not from content height
[15:01:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not true at all.
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> you can use percentages.
[15:02:15] <robertmaxrees> and/or just not hard define things like vh: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m7y4vpu9/
[15:02:57] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: is fine but there have a background so is not visible that way
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:03:09] <bestdesign> thats why use 1--vh
[15:03:13] <bestdesign> 100vh
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> i think maybe you're confused about how css works heh
[15:03:44] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: hero section
[15:03:49] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[15:03:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:51:16] <ekiro> can someone help me understand why this breaks my code: https://bpaste.net/show/a3355ce1cc96
[16:51:26] <robertmaxrees> define "breaks"
[16:51:37] <ekiro> the goal is to fadein the image once it is downloaded
[16:52:10] <ekiro> for some reason when i add the .load() parts of the rest of the script stop working
[16:52:19] <robertmaxrees> any js errors?
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> "stop working", "breaks", etc. doesn't really describe what issue you're having.,
[16:53:00] <ekiro> Uncaught TypeError: e.indexOf is not a function
[16:53:21] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> and if you remove the load handler?
[16:53:43] <ekiro> no errors
[16:54:01] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using??
[16:54:06] <ekiro> $('#uploaderFile' + id).find('.file-cover').removeClass('ani-bg').html('<img src="/static/img/covers/small/' + data.cover_image + '">').hide().fadeIn();
[16:54:09] <ekiro> latest
[16:54:12] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you need .on('load' instead.
[16:54:22] <ekiro> oh
[16:54:57] <ekiro> so is the new recommended convention to always use .on(..) ?
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> that's been the case since 1.8
[16:55:35] <ekiro> makes sense, because i did have issues using .click but when using .on it worked fine
[16:55:38] <ekiro> thx for the info
[16:56:02] <ekiro> im still super new to jquery. just started couple days ago.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[17:02:31] <ekiro> ok no errors now but it does not fade in after loading (https://bpaste.net/show/0b28ffe3e2f7)
[17:02:46] <robertmaxrees> okay so second off.
[17:02:55] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing so much chaining?
[17:03:26] <ekiro> is that bad?
[17:04:21] <ekiro> seems like its easier to keep track of the chain of events
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> it becomes harder to read.
[17:07:02] <robertmaxrees> also check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/280049/how-to-create-a-javascript-callback-for-knowing-when-an-image-is-loaded
[17:07:43] <robertmaxrees> basically you need to create the image object, bind the handler to it, and then append it.
[17:07:55] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask... why are you trying to fade them in like that?
[17:15:41] <ekiro> the script queries the backend to get the right cover for the file selected. then the response is injected into the html
[17:58:12] <tona> hello everyone, I am getting one error I am not able to initialize the datatable, I am using this command but when I launch my app is always showing me the same warning message
[17:58:37] <tona> jQuery('#package-table')     .on( 'init.dt', function () {         console.log( 'Table initialisation complete: '+new Date().getTime() );     							}          )
[17:58:46] <tona> I am wondering if you one could advice me
[17:59:43] <robertmaxrees> tona i just see a code snippet - did I miss something?
[18:43:16] <ekiro> is it possible to do a fadein on a replacwwith?
[18:43:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:43:33] <robertmaxrees> just do the replacewith and then fadein.
[18:43:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:44:50] <ekiro> does not seem to work =/
[18:44:56] <robertmaxrees> show me? :)
[18:45:02] <ekiro> $('#uploaderFile' + id).find('.autocomplete').replaceWith('<span class="file-title">'+suggestion.value+'</span>').fadeIn(1000);
[18:45:21] <robertmaxrees> so what about it doesn't work?
[18:45:44] <ekiro> the replaced content doesnt fade in
[18:45:51] <robertmaxrees> oh your issue is simple.
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/ -> Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content and return the set of elements that was removed.
[18:46:08] <robertmaxrees> you're running fadeIn on the elements that were removed.
[18:46:12] <robertmaxrees> not the new one you used.
[18:46:26] <ekiro> o
[18:46:35] <ekiro> so
[18:47:03] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:47:14] <ekiro> not sure what to do. thinking..
[18:47:20] <ekiro> i use a func inside replacewith() ?
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> erm/
[18:47:32] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to solve anything.
[18:47:56] <robertmaxrees> sec
[18:48:56] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e623fb8c975d
[18:49:50] <robertmaxrees> something like this,
[18:50:16] <ekiro> interesting
[18:50:29] <ekiro> ill give it a trt
[18:50:31] <ekiro> try
[18:54:14] <ekiro> worked thx
[19:27:33] <ekiro> is there a way to attach a function to be called when a certain event/function is executed in a plugin? the issue i have is when the user clicks on a title to change it, it turns into a input followed with a autocomplete. now when the user dosn't select anything but clicks somewhere on the page, the autocomplete vanishes but the clicked field is still a input, i would like to revert it back to a title field with the unchanged title
[19:35:04] <skzn> apologies for the low quality gif, but does anyone know why my slideToggle is jumping for the last half the animation? https://media.giphy.com/media/VdQBNbrZUZIzFOQO0i/giphy.gif
[19:35:29] <skzn> I am hoping to smooth it out uniformly. Anyone know what is going on here?
