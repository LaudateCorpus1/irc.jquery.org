[00:11:34] <DesignerX> hi, how can I create a chain of functions to be called one aftr the other ? I'm trying to animate some elements on a web page & want elemts to fadein/slideIn one after the other starting from the top of the page
[00:15:22] <abhi_> are jQuery DOM selectors more efficient than using native DOM selectors?
[00:15:53] <systemfault> DesignerX: You could use promises.
[00:16:05] <systemfault> abhi_: Never.
[00:16:32] <systemfault> abhi_: You can't expect an abstraction (jQuery) to have absolutely no cost.
[00:18:03] <abhi_> jQuery team must be doing something to address this
[00:18:10] <systemfault> What?
[00:18:28] <abhi_> to make the selectors more efficient
[00:18:46] <systemfault> More efficient that native? Good f****g luck with that.
[00:18:57] <DesignerX> systemfault: ty, will look into that
[00:20:32] <DesignerX> systemfault: does this look right (i'm new to JS & Jquery)        $("#Main").slideDown().done(function() { /* code here */ });
[00:20:55] <systemfault> DesignerX: IIRC, you need to call .promise() before .done
[00:20:58] <DesignerX> so with this, when slideDown()  is done it should call the next animation ?
[00:21:36] <systemfault> DesignerX: http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/
[00:21:49] <systemfault> DesignerX: Here is how you can chain promises.
[00:22:14] <systemfault> So, it will fadeIn elem1... then elem2 then it will do a stupid alert()
[00:23:06] <DesignerX> looks great :)  I think this is what I need , test time
[00:23:14] <systemfault> Nice :)
[00:27:40] <DesignerX> is it possible to do like $(document).promise().then  so things start as soon as the documents is ready ?
[00:28:07] <systemfault> DesignerX: Just add the code inside your document ready, no need for a promise.
[00:28:54] <systemfault> DesignerX: http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/1/
[00:30:07] <DesignerX> systemfault: kk ..
[00:30:28] <DesignerX> question, on line 7  ,is it required that the function retens a value ?
[00:30:33] <DesignerX> returns *
[00:31:52] <systemfault> DesignerX: If you want to chain promises, you need to return a promise a each step
[00:32:15] <DesignerX> oh, yeh good point
[00:32:44] <DesignerX> so it's promis().then()  , each function should return it's promise to be passed on
[00:33:09] <systemfault> Yeah
[00:33:31] <systemfault> animations are async in JS... so you need promises to easily chain them
[00:33:58] <systemfault> IIRC, jQuery also has "animation queues" to do something similar but promises are more flexible.
[00:34:14] <systemfault> Like.. one of the steps could be a ajax transaction..
[00:35:16] <DesignerX> & to be sure , this is a good way to do it ?
[00:35:49] <DesignerX> not just a "working" example .. if you have anything else to recomend, dont be shy .. i'm still learning :)
[00:36:09] <DesignerX> (but so far, it's working as i need it)
[00:36:28] <systemfault> Yeah, it's a fine way to do it even though using animation queues "could" achieve shorter code.
[00:36:38] <systemfault> Promises are always more flexible.
[00:37:28] <DesignerX> I kinda had problem with animation queue , where I need 2 functions to apply at once (like slideIn & fadeIn )
[00:37:46] <DesignerX> will work on that next
[00:38:01] <systemfault> DesignerX: With the standard animation queue http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/2/
[00:38:06] <systemfault> Err
[00:38:13] <systemfault> THis: http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/3/
[00:38:24] <systemfault> Like I said, shorter.
[00:38:58] <systemfault> As you add more elements to fade... the code will become ugly... unlike the version with promises.
[00:44:20] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/4/ queue        VS            http://jsfiddle.net/Tqsv8/5/   promises
[00:45:00] <systemfault> (There are typos with my variable declarations... but oh well..)
[01:28:25] <workerbeetwo> hi. after inserting content by ajax the js calls arent executed.  ...<a onClick="doSomething_fct()"> ...  (doSoemthing is implemented in the page that makes the ajax call)
[01:28:33] <workerbeetwo> is that normal?
[01:28:44] <noob> hi guys
[01:29:16] <noob> i have a problem with including ajax and jquery togrther
[01:30:11] <noob> i am using this bootstrap template http://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin-v2/
[01:30:53] <noob> and when i include this line <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[01:31:20] <noob> the js of the template stopps working
[01:31:32] <noob> without <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[01:31:41] <noob> my ajax calls don't work
[01:31:56] <sacho> "stops working" and "doesn't work" are not program errors.
[01:32:36] <noob> just a minute i will post the exact error
[01:32:46] <noob> ReferenceError: $ is not defined 	  $.ajax({
[01:33:13] <noob> this is what happens before i add <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[01:34:33] <noob> when i do include it, it says
[01:34:33] <noob> TypeError: $(...).tooltip is not a function 	  $('.tooltip-demo').tooltip({  World: World Cup# (line 364) TypeError: $(...).metisMenu is not a function 	  $('#side-menu').metisMenu();
[01:38:12] <noob> when i include both, it disrupts the js of the template, ajax calls work, and the following errors are displayed:
[01:38:13] <noob> ReferenceError: $ is not defined 	  $.ajax({  World: World Cup# (line 314) TypeError: $(...).tooltip is not a function 	  $('.tooltip-demo').tooltip({  World: World Cup# (line 364) TypeError: $(...).metisMenu is not a function 	  $('#side-menu').metisMenu();
[01:40:42] <noob> i cant believe it
[01:40:48] <noob> it is now working!!!!!
[01:41:08] <noob> sacho you are the man!
[01:41:33] <workerbeetwo> ok. perhaps you might help me then.
[01:43:40] <workerbeetwo> Is this normal behaviour? <div> <a attribute="not_working_js_fct()"> </div>   <-- inner <a>  is loaded by ajax., despite the not_working_js_fct is implemented in this page.
[01:45:28] <sacho> what?
[01:45:44] <sacho> make a test case.
[01:56:44] <emx> how can i $.fancybox() html code and provide settings (like execute JS before show etc.)?
[01:57:18] <emx> $.fancybox( html ) itself works but $.fancybox( html, settings ) tries to load the url contained in html.
[01:57:23] <workerbeetwo> isnt that sufficient for a test case? what didnt you understand? the structure is this: calling.html{  js code: function doSomething(){...}   |  $.get(called.html);("#cotent").html(data_fromajax) | <div id="content" ></div>  }  -------------   called.html{ <a onClick="doSomething()"> click me!</a> (or any other attribute>) }
[01:57:48] <sacho> put it up on jsfiddle.
[02:01:28] <emx> how do i include plugins?
[02:04:20] <emx> i'm too stupid for this. but this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/pw6Pu/
[02:07:38] <sacho> don't forget to include jquery as well
[02:08:32] <enoch> hi all, im making a notify system facebook-like, what is the best way to take information about new events from the server? now im using a setTimeout function that makes an ajax call every 3 seconds.
[02:09:33] <systemfault> enoch: facebook uses longpolling...
[02:10:55] <systemfault> enoch: It starts a ajax transaction... but the server takes like 40 seconds to close the connection if it hasn't received any new notifications. If it gets a notification, it closes the connection so you get the JSON... then the client parses it then restart the loop
[02:11:04] <enoch> i've seen
[02:12:01] <enoch> mhh
[02:13:21] <enoch> and how to handle it using php?
[02:15:18] <workerbeetwo> sacho too complicated for jsfiddle. I would need to mock an ajax call.
[02:16:07] <systemfault> enoch: I'd be surprised if it uses PHP... PHP can't scale for that specific task.
[02:16:32] <systemfault> enoch: You would need something async.... like Java/node/C#...
[02:17:25] <systemfault> enoch: The webserver would spawn a lot of PHP processes... it would probably take a ton of memory
[02:18:28] <sacho> enoch, you can use websockets.
[02:19:08] <enoch> going to ask in #php :D
[02:19:18] <rootytooty> hi folks, having a small issue with my jquery click tooltip, im making here: http://jsfiddle.net/Hzw8w/ i want to only "this" tooltip to toggle when i click on the anchor. The problem is that when I click now all of the tooltips open. Can someone help me with my syntax?
[02:26:41] <Amnesia> question, does it make any sense to bind something to the load event in a .ready() function ?
[02:26:49] <Amnesia> I don't think so right?
[02:26:56] <systemfault> Amnesia: Not really.
[02:27:31] <systemfault> There's pretty much no use for load event of the document these days.
[02:27:47] <Amnesia> ah ok, ty
[02:55:24] <andywww> if i were to do $(‘.container’).append(‘<div class=“inside_box”></div>’)
[02:55:37] <andywww> how would i then append another div inside .inside box please?
[02:56:00] <andywww> i tried chaining it but it just added them both to .container
[02:56:26] <sacho_> .find('div.inside_box').append()
[02:58:56] <andywww> that’d do it
[02:58:57] <andywww> graci
[03:04:25] <northernbrother> probably isn't the best place to ask but i just upgraded (Mac OS X) to the latest Sublime Text. Im trying to remove "Vintage" mode from my ignored_packages. Yet, in the file I can't do anything: can't backspace, delete, add, etc etc. Any ideas?
[03:05:39] <northernbrother> other files (within this same app) i can do the above...why is it restricting me in only one file?
[03:06:50] <dokma> I'm using .draggable with a handle on a "title bar". this title bar contains a minimize icon and now I'd like to disable window dragging by the icon
[03:07:00] <dokma> tried e.stopPropagation on the icon click handler
[03:07:04] <dokma> but no worky
[03:09:19] <northernbrother> dokma: any screenshots/jsfiddle by chance?
[03:09:48] <dokma> it's a part of a large code base... it'll take some time to make a fiddle
[03:10:03] <dokma> I'have one more shot with jqueryObject.draggable('disable');
[03:11:02] <northernbrother> for sure, understood: sometimes making a fiddle given the scenario is a pain in the ass.
[03:15:16] <noob> hi guys
[03:17:34] <noob> do you know why this navbar has a scrollbar when the window is smaller, (like when you open firebug or some other console window and it takes some space from the bottom of the screen)
[03:17:55] <noob> http://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin
[03:18:27] <noob> and how to copy that feature to this template?
[03:18:36] <noob> http://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin-v2/
[03:18:45] <systemfault> noob: Add overflow: auto; to the container.
[03:20:48] <noob> you mean adding it to one of these classes?    <div class="navbar-default navbar-static-side" role="navigation">
[03:21:30] <systemfault> noob: I don't know, I don't write crap CSS like that.
[03:22:22] <noob> the side menu is inside that nav tag
[03:22:42] <systemfault> noob: Try adding it to the nav tag.
[03:22:47] <noob> i tried adding the overflow: auto; to that tag
[03:23:06] <noob> it doesn't work
[03:23:30] <systemfault> noob: Is your website online?
[03:24:09] <noob>  http://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin-v2/
[03:24:18] <noob> this is the template i am using
[03:32:31] <noob> systemfault do you have an idea how to do it?
[03:33:04] <systemfault> noob: Not sure if it's possible with your layout, it's a crappy one.
[03:33:16] <systemfault> Using absolute positioning for the left menu
[03:41:09] <enoch> mhh i'm trying to use logn pooling and it is working, but i noticed that if i change page during a request the server hangs up until the old request is completed? is it possible? Is it because of nginx?
[03:53:31] <PrasanthG> Hello. Is there any plugin to scroll the horizontal tabs when they are overflowed horizontally?
[04:27:23] <PrasanthG> Hello.
[04:28:22] <PrasanthG> I had a horizontal tabs accordion and in one accordion there is a jquery slider and it isn't running when i browse through that accordian
[05:08:39] <MikeD_> anyone have experience building an unobtrusive debugging window that can be in a deployed app where console and such tools are not available?
[05:13:57] <systemfault> MikeD_: In the best cases... remote debugging tools are available.
[05:14:12] <systemfault> ios on mac for example..
[05:14:25] <MikeD_> i am far from best case
[05:14:45] <systemfault> Perhaps you could embed firebug lite on the page... not sure.
[05:18:10] <Daghdha> Do i understand correct context menu is not a default JquiryUI widget?
[05:48:47] <Nindustries> Hi, I'm using handlebars for my web app and I'm trying to load a template dynamically. I'm using following code, but using "javascript:app.navigate('register');" always gives me a blank page. Could someone take a look? thanks! https://github.com/HazCod/Quackr/blob/master/js/index.js
[05:51:06] <PrasanthG> Here is the issue http://jsfiddle.net/8pZer/1/ when we go to tab no 2 the images aren't loaded and it needs page refresh to work
[05:52:37] <Daghdha> works in chrome
[05:52:39] <PrasanthG> how can i fix it?
[05:52:41] <Daghdha> PrasanthG
[05:52:45] <PrasanthG> in firefox please
[05:53:45] <Daghdha> also works in firefox maybe i misunderstand
[05:53:54] <Daghdha> i click tab 2 and should see some birds image?
[05:54:12] <PrasanthG> they are responsive horizontal tabs, please maximize the size of result window before activating tab 2
[05:54:51] <PrasanthG> in mobile layout it is working, but when we resize the result window and go to tab2 it isnt showing images by default
[05:55:05] <Daghdha> tab 1 shows no image
[05:55:08] <Daghdha> tab 2 does
[05:55:13] <Daghdha> tab 3 does not
[05:56:26] <Daghdha> works on my machine.. what can i say
[05:56:51] <PrasanthG> this is the live issue http://202.53.73.15:90/sscds/dept_oralmedrad.html#infrastruc
[05:57:46] <PrasanthG> http://202.53.73.15:90/sscds/dept_oralmaxpath.html if you click on infrastructure, the images arent showing
[05:58:48] <PrasanthG> Academics > Departments > Periodontics and Infrastructure tab
[05:59:33] <PrasanthG> in some departments the images are showing but in some departments not
[05:59:57] <Daghdha> are they maybe coming from a domain that
[06:00:06] <Daghdha> is blockd?
[06:00:08] <PrasanthG> no
[06:00:16] <PrasanthG> if we refresh the page, the images load
[06:00:23] <PrasanthG> from then they are working fine
[06:00:41] <PrasanthG> but at first instance some departments aren't showing images
[06:00:41] <Daghdha> works frin for me from the get go
[06:04:17] <PrasanthG> toggle between few deprtments in firefox and open this department http://202.53.73.15:90/sscds/dept_pubhealthden.html and go to infrastructure please
[06:05:22] <PrasanthG> i cant exactly specify the issue as it is appearing autonomous
[06:08:06] <silverdust> I have this json object being received as response {"message":"some message"}
[06:08:49] <silverdust> It comes back fine in some cases, in some cases I have an extra object in it but it varies
[06:09:10] <silverdust> here is an example of me catching an object returned console.log(response.message.slug[0]);
[06:09:38] <silverdust> It wouldn't always be slug but I'll always need to access [0] of whatever it is
[06:10:29] <silverdust> how can I set the slug object area to vary and work fine for any other object even when it's not slug
[06:16:48] <skullcrasher> how can i find elements without a data attribute?
[06:16:48] <cld_> hey, i wanna set the width of each container to it's associated img's width -- http://jsfiddle.net/XmzKn/2/ -- i would like to automatize it this is why i tried something like this : http://puu.sh/9C4VP/61432ceffe.png but it seems like it's not the right structure. any help ?
[06:17:03] <skullcrasher> as the data attribute is optional
[06:17:44] <cld_> (i just wanted to display an alert message with the first image's width but it doesnt display)
[06:22:56] <Kartagis> hi
[06:23:21] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/u7ZBU/17/ <--- is this correct syntax?
[06:24:33] <m1su> cld_: you could either float the divs or just put display: inline-block;
[06:24:34] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: No.
[06:24:52] <m1su> cld_: both should shrink the div to the image's width
[06:24:57] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Check out your dev tool sand you'll see the error.
[06:25:02] <cld_> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/u7ZBU/18/
[06:25:20] <systemfault> Kartagis: 2 problems with that code.... one of them is a syntax error
[06:25:36] <BillCriswell> cld_: That wasn't what he wanted.
[06:25:55] <BillCriswell> systemfault: What's the second? I think I'm missing one haha.
[06:26:35] <Kartagis> cld_: I want to react to link being clicked, not the whole document
[06:26:41] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Ah, preventDefault()?
[06:26:43] <systemfault> BillCriswell: The other is behavioral....
[06:26:47] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Exactly.
[06:27:04] <BillCriswell> Took me a moment.
[06:27:06] <systemfault> BillCriswell: You rock :)
[06:27:44] <cld_> ok kay
[06:27:51] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/u7ZBU/19/ This would work, the e.preventDefault() keeps the browser from going to the link you clicked... unless youw anted to do that. Then remove it haha.
[06:27:55] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/u7ZBU/20/ worked for me
[06:27:58] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Smarter than the average bear.
[06:28:24] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: You have to be careful with that. Some browsers don't give you that event variable off the bat.
[06:28:48] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: The one I linked you to is the safest I think
[06:29:01] <systemfault> Kartagis: You're supposed to use the normalized "event" variable jquery gives you
[06:29:13] <systemfault> Kartagis: Like this http://jsfiddle.net/u7ZBU/21/
[06:30:36] <cld_> m1su: it  isn't working, tbh i just would like to have the syntax to put a " i " into a selector? idk the real names of the elements but something like in my puush link (http://puu.sh/9C4VP/61432ceffe.png)
[06:31:02] <cld_> like for i=1 it should be views-row-1, then i=2 views-row-2 ...
[06:31:38] <cld_> maybe i could append stuff like views-row-    + i and then set it in another variable ...
[06:38:22] <ortix> i'm trying to bind a click event on dynamically generated buttons which all have the same class
[06:38:50] <ortix> i have button0 which generates button1 and if i click either button0 or button1 button2 should be generated
[06:38:59] <ortix> but button2 is only generated when button0 is clicked
[06:39:26] <ortix> i tried using .on() and binding the click event to the ".button" class to no avail
[06:39:29] <ortix> any ideas?
[06:39:47] <skullcrasher> how do i get parameter from $.proxy(function,this,parameter1,parameter2) in the called function??
[06:40:10] <skullcrasher> I only see the event thats given to the function
[06:40:53] <BillCriswell> ortix: You would need class="button button0" class="button button1" etc
[06:41:02] <BillCriswell> If you wanted to bind to just .button
[06:41:09] <BillCriswell> Then that should work no problem.
[06:43:11] <ortix> i read that $("#button_container").on("click", ".button-class", function(e){...}) should work with dynamically generated content
[06:43:20] <ortix> but for some reason it leaves me in the dark
[06:43:43] <BillCriswell> ortix: It does. It looks like you only have class="button0" according to your question.
[06:44:35] <ortix> no i have class="button"
[06:44:41] <ortix> that's what makes it so weird
[06:45:12] <BillCriswell> ortix: Need to make a demo then.
[06:45:24] <ortix> working on it
[06:45:32] <BillCriswell> The problem is not with .on() for sure though.
[06:47:19] <silverdust> in this paste http://jsbin.com/sojofifi/1/edit , you can see the warning about a missing semi colon
[06:47:37] <silverdust> Something really awkward is going on with that script
[06:47:38] <ortix> i'll probably end up figuring out myself while making the demo :p
[06:47:41] <ortix> always silly mistakes XD
[06:47:52] <BillCriswell> ortix: That's why we usually recommend that.
[06:47:56] <silverdust> When I give it the proper semi-colon, it fails
[06:47:57] <BillCriswell> Isolation is a beautiful thing haha
[06:48:02] <ortix> true that
[06:48:04] <silverdust> but without the semi-colon it works
[06:48:56] <BillCriswell> ortix: http://jsbin.com/hipowezi/1/edit?html,js,output small demo
[06:49:35] <silverdust> can anyone tell why this may be happening?
[06:49:54] <silverdust> works without a semi-colon, fails with the semi-colon
[06:50:43] <ortix> BillCriswell: i ended up figuring it out
[06:50:49] <BillCriswell> ortix: Cool.
[06:50:50] <ortix> was an issue with id's
[06:50:55] <BillCriswell> Good time.s
[06:51:16] <ortix> but i do have 1 question. The button ia a <a href="#"> element
[06:51:18] <BillCriswell> silverdust: Is there an error when you put in the semi-colon?
[06:51:30] <ortix> how do i prevent the page from jumping back to the top when the button is clicked
[06:51:36] <silverdust> no there is none
[06:51:50] <BillCriswell> ortix: Pass the event to the callback and do event.preventDefault()
[06:51:52] <mintmoney> ortix: change # to 'javascript:;'
[06:51:58] <BillCriswell> mintmoney: lol
[06:52:01] <silverdust> BillCriswell: what really fails is this -> $('#staffForm').attr('action', base+"storestaff/"+submittedId);
[06:52:11] <ortix> apparently return false also works
[06:52:19] <mintmoney> nope
[06:52:22] <mintmoney> only javascript:;
[06:52:29] <BillCriswell> ortix: Works in different ways. Be careful you know the difference.
[06:52:40] <ortix> ok cool :)
[06:52:46] <silverdust> It fails to add the attribute to the selected value
[06:53:06] <silverdust> I must say #staffForm is not ready on page load
[06:53:17] <silverdust> It's in a <template>
[06:53:57] <silverdust> and with what I've heard, sometimes, selectors only select elements that are ready on page load
[06:54:05] <BillCriswell> silverdust: You'd need to provide some HTML to that fiddle.
[06:54:10] <BillCriswell> silverdust: Yes.
[06:54:35] <silverdust> Cork told me to use $(document).on(... in such cases but that's when it's based on an event
[06:55:06] <silverdust> I can't use document with attr
[06:55:24] <silverdust> Or I'd rather say I don't know how to
[06:56:11] <BillCriswell> silverdust: Can you describe what you want to do from the start?
[06:56:12] <silverdust> I mean like the way we use it when it's based on an event like $(document).on('event','element',function(){});
[06:57:05] <silverdust> I want to give staffForm an attribute of base+"storestaff/"+submittedId)
[06:57:13] <silverdust> *base+"storestaff/"+submittedId
[06:57:34] <silverdust> the variable submittedId is still available when I logged it
[06:57:42] <silverdust> but it's not getting the attribute
[06:58:12] <BillCriswell> Is staffform the form that is triggering the submit even on document?
[06:58:31] <silverdust> no
[06:58:42] <silverdust> I have a different form compform
[06:58:58] <BillCriswell> Ok, so when staffForm submits you want to change the action on compForm ?
[06:59:08] <BillCriswell> or the opposite?
[06:59:10] <silverdust> as soon as it is submitted, it's supposed to add an id as an argument to the action of the next form which is staffForm
[06:59:21] <silverdust> the opposite
[06:59:51] <silverdust> when compform submits, change action of staffForm
[07:00:00] <BillCriswell> silverdust: There we go.
[07:00:15] <silverdust> it's why I have $(document).on('submit','#compform',
[07:00:48] <silverdust> BillCriswell: where?
[07:00:58] <BillCriswell> silverdust: The goal haha
[07:01:32] <silverdust> ok are you working on it?
[07:01:51] <BillCriswell> Trying to think of how to explain it.
[07:05:05] <silverdust> BillCriswell: I'm trying to add some HTML to make the problem more detailed
[07:05:19] <BillCriswell> silverdust: http://jsbin.com/metigemi/1/edit?html,js,output does this help?
[07:05:41] <BillCriswell> If I understood your whole situation I could write it better but this is just to keep things clear.
[07:07:25] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[07:12:06] <DelphiWorld> hey, jQueryers
[07:12:15] <DelphiWorld> question:
[07:12:39] <DelphiWorld> if i want a div that contin several photos that will show one by one...
[07:12:42] <DelphiWorld> keep turning
[07:12:46] <DelphiWorld> what's that called?
[07:13:06] <Chuk> DelphiWorld: carousel?
[07:13:28] <DelphiWorld> chuckharmston_: good, maybe
[07:13:34] <DelphiWorld> Chuk: laybe
[07:13:48] <BillCriswell> Slideshow is another term form it.
[07:13:48] <DelphiWorld> Chuk: do i need to add the pics one by one, or it can be indexed?
[07:14:15] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: ah
[07:14:28] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: what about pictures... do i need to add one by one or it can be indexed
[07:14:45] <Chuk> DelphiWorld: What do you mean by "indexed"?
[07:15:05] <BillCriswell> I'd just look at the documentation of the one you want, also not sure what you mean by indexed.
[07:15:11] <DelphiWorld> Chuk: maybe a plugin that can auto list them from a dir
[07:16:14] <BillCriswell> Javascript can't read a directory from your web server. You'd need like a php script or something to glob it and pass the paths to it.
[07:16:16] <Chuk> Not sure about that. I usually just pick a carousel plugin and follow their docs. I have always added pics with server-side code
[07:16:32] <silverdust> BillCriswell: here is the situation in a clearer form http://jsbin.com/sojofifi/1/edit
[07:16:56] <DelphiWorld> thank you BillCriswell and Chuk
[07:17:03] <Chuk> :)
[07:17:38] <silverdust> It's so clear here and what I want is for staffForm to get the action value I'm giving it while it's switching to staffForm
[07:18:33] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:18:57] * DelphiWorld is blind and creating slideshow... :P
[07:19:16] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Are you seriously blind?
[07:19:31] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: yes, truely blind
[07:19:45] <bberry> how would you monitor changes of a divs innerHTML
[07:20:04] <DelphiWorld> bberry: my screen reader do it :P
[07:20:09] <bberry> (like lets say im dynamically adding and removing <span>s)
[07:20:20] <bberry> lol
[07:20:27] <DelphiWorld> lol
[07:20:39] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: When you come across a website with a slideshow and it autoadvances does the screen reader just cut off and start reading the next thing or does it just read like a list?
[07:21:01] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: no, you'lle need to move up and down to get the update
[07:21:21] <BillCriswell> I mean when you're visiting other websites, not the one you're working on.
[07:21:40] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: yes, regardless any dynamic content you'lle need to manualy read it
[07:21:57] <BillCriswell> I was always curious about that. Cool.
[07:22:17] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: ;)
[07:22:19] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: So you basically just get the raw HTML read out to you?
[07:22:51] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: no, if its a photo it just say picture or image depand on the screen reader, and some readers say graphic
[07:23:09] <BillCriswell> I'm really interested in how you'd design and debug a slideshow without being able to see it. I bet that is a hell of an experience.
[07:23:41] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: if i dont disturb someone localy, i cant get it to work
[07:24:51] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I was trying to imagine the x, y, width and height of everything being spoken to you and debugging from there.
[07:25:12] <DelphiWorld> no... that's currently not pocible
[07:26:10] <BillCriswell> One day!
[07:26:27] <DelphiWorld> i hope
[07:28:08] <Nyoom> How can I do something like this? http://privatepaste.com/64e3402bdd if I only use quote: " or ' the onclick event doesn't seem to work
[07:31:20] <hecatonicosachor> escape the appropriate quotes.
[07:31:59] <Nyoom> That's what I'm trying to, escaping quotes is like \" right?
[07:37:43] <Nyoom> oh :)
[07:37:43] <Nyoom> ty
[07:49:46] <decx> that's a quote calamity
[07:55:10] <BillCriswell> I have something going well right now that I'd never assume would go well.
[07:55:59] <decx> irc from the toilet eh, not bad
[07:56:23] <BillCriswell> I couldn't do that to you guys.
[07:56:50] <thebope> lol
[07:57:03] <thebope> Whats going well?
[07:57:49] <BillCriswell> I have a desktop only site, and they want a mobile version of it so I'm just using a "mobile only" stylesheet and it's working out pretty good so far.
[07:58:26] <BillCriswell> When I have the choice I go mobile first, but this is working out pretty good.
[07:59:08] <BillCriswell> pritty, pritty, pritty... pritty good
[07:59:22] <thebope> haha, that is nice actually
[07:59:26] <thebope> It must be well designed
[07:59:46] <thebope> I can just imagine the terror of converting the internal tool we're working on to be mobile friendly
[07:59:49] <thebope> I think I'd quit
[07:59:50] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah. It's broken down very well.
[08:00:24] <BillCriswell> I have to figure out what to do with these tables now though.
[08:00:24] <thebope> dang it benefits package provider, who the hell has a fax machine these days
[08:00:31] <thebope> sur le table
[08:03:11] <BillCriswell> This site isn't using border-box either and it's still not that bad working on it.
[08:05:57] <basile_s> Hello, I'm Basile Starynkevitch.
[08:06:02] <thebope> whats border-box?
[08:06:10] <thebope> I guess I could google that
[08:06:12] <thebope> hey basile_s
[08:06:27] <BillCriswell> thebope: It's width = width + border + padding
[08:06:36] <basile_s> What is the simplest way with jquery to catch the enter key in input elements of type text?
[08:06:50] <basile_s> Using jquery2, firefox30, Debian/Sid
[08:07:23] <thebope> $("yourSelector).keypress(function(e) {})
[08:07:35] <BillCriswell> thebope: I explained that wrong. Width = width - border - padding
[08:07:45] <BillCriswell> where content-box is width + border + padding
[08:08:01] <basile_s> Ok. Nothing simpler than catch every keypress and testing againt 13?
[08:08:02] <thebope> ahh okay, is that a design strategy?
[08:08:19] <thebope> basile_s, I don't believe spo
[08:08:33] <BillCriswell> thebope: http://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/ this explains it well
[08:09:01] <basile_s> I find strange that input fields obey in an easier way to the tab key than to the enter key (which feels more natural for finishing the entry of some text)
[08:09:22] <thebope> I think the tab action is performed at the browser level
[08:09:46] <basile_s> Yes, it probably changes the focus, but so what?
[08:09:50] <Daghdha> can you change the id of a object, i am cloning some object and then paste it back. But it has the same id as the source object wich causes a problem
[08:10:08] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Sure can.
[08:10:21] <BillCriswell> var $bar = $foo.clone().attr('id', 'bar');
[08:10:22] <thebope> .attr('id', 'yournewid')
[08:10:39] <Daghdha> Thank you
[08:10:52] <Chuk> Shouldn't it be .prop('id','yournewid')?
[08:11:03] <basile_s> thanks. Bye!
[08:11:09] <BillCriswell> Chuk: Probably lol
[08:11:19] <thebope> Ahh that makes sense
[08:11:27] <thebope> Does it matter?
[08:11:47] <BillCriswell> Chuk: If they use .prop() I don't think they can do $('#new-id')
[08:12:00] <BillCriswell> I'm really not sure. Would need to experiment.
[08:12:39] <thebope> I'm going to try
[08:12:43] <decx> it most certainly works
[08:12:52] <Chuk> Me too. I never really looked into the difference b/t prop and attr. I just vaguely remember reading something that said we should be using the former over the latter.
[08:13:12] <BillCriswell> Chuk: Eh, it depends, and it's a really annoying case of "depends"
[08:13:31] <BillCriswell> decx: So .prop() would update the attribute on the element?
[08:13:54] <Daghdha> If the object i have is a dom node with 3 nested divs, how can i reach the 2nd div id to change it's value?
[08:13:54] <decx> yep
[08:14:24] <thebope> they both work
[08:14:26] <thebope> it seems
[08:14:40] <decx> use classes to identify stuff Daghdha
[08:14:46] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: $foo.find('div > div').eq(0) I think you want? Would need to see the code in hand.
[08:15:03] <thebope> are both prop and attr supported on all browsers well?
[08:15:05] <BillCriswell> But what decx said is true.
[08:15:22] <Daghdha> How can i use classes to identify stuff if they alla re the same class?
[08:15:27] <Daghdha> I don't understand that
[08:15:49] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: It could be based on where it is in the DOM.
[08:15:52] <thebope> if they're all the same class you only need one class to identify them?
[08:16:06] <Daghdha> ok if i do closest then class would do i guess yes
[08:16:09] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah. I think you can use either in most cases, but only one is typically the right way. I dunno.
[08:16:18] <thebope> haha BillCriswell
[08:16:31] <Chuk> I have a question regarding where to place a function so that it's accessible from another js file. The way that I'm handling (function($, window, document) might be throwing it off. Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/chukShirley/59c3ee63cf6392a1bc0c
[08:16:32] <thebope> Just some CS BS
[08:16:43] <Daghdha> classes are faster than using ids?
[08:16:57] <thebope> classes are generic, ids are for unique elements
[08:17:16] <Daghdha> oh i do use a class lol $clipboard = $("#" + invokedOn[0].id).closest(".fd").clone(true);
[08:17:30] <thebope> lol
[08:20:10] <thebope> BillCriswell, that articles pretty good thanks
[08:20:18] <BillCriswell> thebope: No problem.
[08:20:39] <Daghdha> hmm i th ink i spot something idiotic in my code
[08:21:14] <thebope> Daghdha, That's the joy of programming ;-)
[08:21:54] <Mateo_> Anyone using jqm and cordova ? I have some trouble with that : https://gist.github.com/KuneStudio/f1e67202f330a73a5423
[08:22:08] <BillCriswell> Foundation is called "Foundation for Sites" now. That's kind of confusing to me.
[08:22:40] <thebope> I'm using Foundation for Sites for my sites
[08:22:42] <Mateo_> When I launch the app, it seems that lendingList is not prepared. I don’t know what to do to make it prepared before filling the list ...
[08:22:46] <thebope> sites
[08:23:22] <Mateo_> If I go to another page then come back to the home, with the listview, everything is displaying.
[08:23:45] <Mateo_> I’m probably missing something, but I’ve used all my capacities :)
[08:24:29] <Daghdha> $clipboard = invokedOn.closest(".fd").clone(true);       is better than   $("#" + invokedOn[0].id).closest(".fd").clone(true);
[08:24:55] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: I'd say so.
[08:25:48] <Mateo_> in the deviceReady function, I just create my list (that I have separated so it is easier to update), then launch startApp
[08:27:32] <thebope> ahhh and now I get to the wonderful border-box model
[08:27:40] <thebope> I waved my hands in the air and said "wonderful!"
[08:28:09] <thebope> just reading about the conundrums implicit when developing a fluid text area was giving me indigestion
[08:28:25] <thebope> As the great Ignatius J. Reilly would say "I could feel my valve closing!"
[08:31:44] <Daghdha> i read goat there, 2 times. I wondered what kind of goat would have such an elaborate name.
[08:33:01] <BillCriswell> great goat.
[08:34:34] <nFFF> how is this causing a closure? imageCnt is having two counts? http://jsfiddle.net/t6cK5/
[08:37:23] <thebope> hahaha Daghdha
[08:41:32] <Fraz> hey
[08:41:46] <Fraz> how do i acheive something like this? http://pastebin.com/P32gGhp3
[08:42:22] <Fraz> i want set_image to access the content variable set in the same object
[08:42:46] <Fraz> and i want content to use the backgroundImage when being set
[08:48:27] <spyzer> hey guys, can anyone please point me to some libraries which are related to scroll detection but in terms of object e.g say #element came into view than i make it static
[08:48:39] <spyzer> some library which can help me doing that stuff easily
[08:50:13] <duch_kazatel> spyzer totally depends on the use case - are you trying to update tabs on a page based on what elements come into view?
[08:50:42] <spyzer> duch_kazatel: I just came across this link -> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#about do you know of others?
[08:50:56] <duch_kazatel> might want to answer my question first ;)
[08:52:55] <duch_kazatel> because that's entirely possible to do without a library
[08:53:29] <decx> basicly filter on window scroll http://jsfiddle.net/decx/w5pFm/
[08:53:33] <spyzer> duch_kazatel: basically two things when i have scrolled from bottom to a certain limit i want to attach a class to my nav which does some CSS animating, secondly while scrolling down a box on right scrolls into view the moment it is 20% from the top it should remain fixed until the end of scroll. Going back it should go down again
[08:54:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah, no need for a plugin or extra lib to do that.  you can watch the scroll event and and fire based on current position.
[08:54:49] <spyzer> I think waypoints just works for my case, but is there any other lib?
[08:54:56] <spyzer> duch_kazatel: hmm
[08:55:08] <duch_kazatel> look at what decx showed you.
[08:55:15] <decx> you're just holding yourself back by relying on libs for every little thing
[08:55:21] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[08:55:24] <duch_kazatel> all day every day
[08:55:29] <decx> ironic to write that in #jquery but anyway
[08:55:30] <decx> ^^
[08:55:53] <duch_kazatel> only if you have to use it for everything :)
[09:00:18] <decx> i'm trying to grasp 2d collision detection for a polygon
[09:00:26] <decx> why does that have to be so math-y
[09:00:36] <decx> circle and rectangles were so easy
[09:03:17] <duch_kazatel> i'm absolutely TERRIBLE with math.
[09:04:04] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: looks like I still have a LOT to read about events ;)
[09:04:11] <thebope> decx, whats difficult about it? Telling whether they've collided or just are really close?
[09:04:14] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ events are easy imo
[09:04:20] <thebope> Are the polygons any shape?
[09:04:29] <decx> no
[09:05:03] <decx> well i have to compare line segments and if the coordinates go through that it's so confusing
[09:05:20] <decx> compared with rect and circle collision at least
[09:05:24] <NoiseEee> decx: can't you just use an existing library or something?
[09:05:28] <thebope> You couldn't just have a function which at any border pixel of a polygon checked if another polygon existed in that space?
[09:05:50] <decx> it's not for anything productive i just want to grasp the basics of it
[09:06:00] <thebope> I'd imagine, if I was doing this, I'd have a 3D array where 2 dimensions were the space and the third dimension was a list of the polygons there
[09:06:08] <decx> clickable areas inside canvas that arnt circles or rects
[09:06:10] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: Hmm. Maybe, but sometimes, I have some strange things happening. My app work if I have a page before the “home” one, not if there is not.
[09:06:22] <thebope> going through only the border pixels of each polygon reduces the complexity of analysis
[09:06:27] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ huh?  what does that have to do with events?
[09:06:33] <thebope> I'm not sure if that makes sense
[09:06:38] <thebope> but it'd be my initial attempt
[09:06:48] <thebope> might be a naive approach
[09:08:29] <decx> i cant grasp the concepts yet
[09:08:39] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/KuneStudio/f1e67202f330a73a5423  Since I’ve removed the splash screen , I have a lot of problem with that ..
[09:08:57] <decx> like circle is easy, if a x,y coordinates distance to the center of a circle is smaller than the circles radius, it's inside
[09:09:08] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ if you're going to use jquery, then use it ;) use .on() instead.
[09:09:16] <Zimdale_work> Hello
[09:09:45] <decx> and rect is just a bunch of x1+w1 < x2 ...
[09:09:53] <Zimdale_work> So is there some kind of a jquery callback for a css display change?
[09:09:55] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ the code you've shared also relies on a specific event to fire - perhaps your splash fired that event?
[09:10:16] <duch_kazatel> Zimdale_work like what?
[09:10:26] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: wich one ? listPrepared ?
[09:11:01] <duch_kazatel> oh i didn't see the other files.  what is CustomEvent?
[09:11:24] <thebope> decx, you have a minimum  of two polygons right? You're trying to test for collisions? Or whether one polygon is entirely inside of another?
[09:11:37] <Zimdale_work> Like an event when display:none changes to display:block
[09:11:42] <thebope> decx, oh I see with the circle one
[09:11:49] <duch_kazatel> Zimdale_work nope.
[09:11:57] <Zimdale_work> damn....
[09:12:09] <duch_kazatel> Zimdale_work just write a function and call that instead to fire your other logic.
[09:12:23] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I thought that I had problems with the order when loading jqm and phonegap (and I probably have)
[09:12:46] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ also be aware that jquery events and native dom events aren't the same thing.
[09:12:56] <Zimdale_work> I can't, I'm working on code is rediculously built
[09:12:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't have any experience with phonegap, so I can't help you with that.
[09:13:08] <Zimdale_work> and I'd have it off to the core team which nobody would like.
[09:13:14] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:13:29] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: Where do I don’t use on btw ?
[09:13:46] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ in your index file.
[09:14:07] <duch_kazatel> but like i said, i don't know anything about phonegap so it could be doing crazy magic under the hood.
[09:14:22] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: ok ^^
[09:17:37] <thebope> decx, I think you need calculus. You can imagine that a polygon is a circle where the radius varies based upon angle. There should be a center. You can develop an equation based on the angles of the polygon's sides which varies the length of the radius based on the angle of the radius from 0 degrees
[09:17:56] <BillCriswell> The internet makes it look really easy to look like you know what you're doing.
[09:18:01] <obert> under windows my script doesnt works on chrome because of file//
[09:18:04] <thebope> easier said than done! ;-)
[09:18:21] <duch_kazatel> obert then setup a local server.
[09:18:44] <obert> duch_kazatel: it is minutes that I try to understand that point
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:19:09] <obert> duch_kazatel: local server == just localhost?
[09:19:09] <thebope> I think the problem becomes if your polygon might have a radius to a far corner which extends through portions of the plane which the polygon does not cover
[09:19:13] <thebope> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon
[09:19:18] <duch_kazatel> local server === an actual server.
[09:19:25] <obert> duch_kazatel: or something chrome-related
[09:19:26] <thebope> you can see some examples of polygons like that on here
[09:19:51] <decx> i think i'm gonna start with a triangle ^^
[09:19:51] <obert> hmm
[09:19:57] <duch_kazatel> obert just set up an actual local server.  apache, nginx, a python script, anything.
[09:20:11] <duch_kazatel> or sign up for a free heroku account.
[09:20:18] <duch_kazatel> or use jsfiddle/jsbin to run stuff.
[09:20:25] <BillCriswell> php -S localhost:8000
[09:20:44] <duch_kazatel> even PHP has a simple way to run a server
[09:21:25] <BillCriswell> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[09:21:45] <BillCriswell> Glad that's a lot easier now a days.
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> i was able to setup a heroku instance for our kegbot for free - it was stupid simple to do.
[09:22:57] <obert> duch_kazatel: localhost seems to let it works
[09:23:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I need to get into that side of things a bit more. "Devops" or whatever the hell it's called.
[09:23:30] <obert> localhost/php server
[09:23:31] <duch_kazatel> obert that means you've got a server running locally then.
[09:23:32] <obert> meh
[09:24:10] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nah that's just systems administration.  heroky is pretty developer friendly imo - point and click with a git repo you push to for deploys.
[09:24:14] <duch_kazatel> *heroku
[09:24:20] <obert> yeah got php and python if i need duch_kazatel thanks. It made me confused since I usually works inside http://localhost, not like now that I used file///
[09:24:23] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah cool.
[09:24:47] <duch_kazatel> obert file:// is trying to read off the hard drive directly - do you see why that might be a bad thing?
[09:24:56] <obert> thay were talking about Chrome web server, which confuses me once again
[09:25:03] <duch_kazatel> obert wut
[09:25:10] <obert> duch_kazatel: yea i see
[09:25:13] <BillCriswell> Chrome web server?
[09:25:24] <thebope> decx, haha, thats a good idea. Then my circle with varying radius concept works okay
[09:25:26] <duch_kazatel> obert i think you're convoluting something here.
[09:25:26] <obert> duch_kazatel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4208530/xmlhttprequest-origin-null-is-not-allowed-access-control-access-allow-for-file
[09:25:32] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell our devops guy mostly handles our vagrant setup and is starting to work a bit on our docker setup.
[09:25:43] <BillCriswell> obert: There is a way to run Chrome where you can read files... but it's not smart to do haha
[09:25:45] <obert> anyway thanks, I think that I got it now, finally
[09:25:49] <BillCriswell> Speaking of which, hope I turned that off.
[09:26:01] <obert> BillCriswell: seems so :p
[09:26:10] <thebope> decx, for crazy polygons you just have multiple ranges on each radius to check
[09:26:18] <thebope> This is fun, I'm enjoying exploring the idea
[09:26:29] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nice. I hope we use that stuff abit more at work. I currently set up my FTP client to auto push files to dev and it's slow.
[09:26:58] <decx> thebope maybe it would be easier to getimageData and check if the color is the same as my fillstyle for the polygon ;)
[09:27:07] <BillCriswell> Especially with drupal without caching turned on.
[09:27:11] <thebope> haha that goes back to my array idea I think
[09:27:50] <obert> coffee time i guess
[09:28:06] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ew.  even we don't do that here.
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell we either run the frontend stack natively or via vagrant.
[09:28:38] <duch_kazatel> anybody else here ever get a recruitment email from amazon btw?
[09:28:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Never got one from Amazon.
[09:29:07] <BillCriswell> Biggest company I ever got one from was LinkedIn.
[09:29:25] <thebope> I don't like LinkedIn
[09:29:38] <systemfault> I hate LinkedIn
[09:29:42] <duch_kazatel> the CEO at my last company is good friends with the founders of linkedin.
[09:29:51] <BillCriswell> If they were willing to pay me a while lot and move me out to Cali I wouldn't immediately dismiss the idea.
[09:30:01] <BillCriswell> pay me a whole lot*
[09:30:04] <thebope> I'm sure they'd try to link you in
[09:30:15] <thebope> shit if they'd pay me in time I might take that too
[09:30:23] <thebope> "Work for a few weeks, take a few weeks off"
[09:30:26] <Daghdha> if i do $(".fi:eq(6)")  i should get the 7th item with the classs fi right?
[09:30:29] <xxMatiasxx> Hi, what is the best way to load a script after another is completly loaded without using requireJS (jquery is allowed). For some reason append to head is not fetching the script.
[09:30:55] <duch_kazatel> xxMatiasxx there's .getScript()
[09:31:43] <duch_kazatel> i put out the amazon question because i just got one.  makes me wonder...
[09:32:10] <xxMatiasxx> duch_kazatel, but that won't append it to dom ?
[09:32:10] <BillCriswell> My friend is texting me drunk from a music festival while I'm at work. She shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[09:32:17] <BillCriswell> While I'm at work.
[09:32:25] <systemfault> Tell her!
[09:32:44] <duch_kazatel> xxMatiasxx huh?  i think you're confused about what "dom" is - could you clarify your question a little?
[09:33:17] <decx> *if you're gonna text me drunk from a festival at least include some boob, ffs that's drunktxt 101*
[09:33:35] <bberry> also, uh. instead of loading scripts in the head, you should probably move them to the bottom of the body
[09:34:06] <bberry> lol.
[09:34:23] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You going to reply out of curiosity? I did that with LinkedIn and the interview experience was pretty interesting. They asked some quality questions I think.
[09:34:57] <duch_kazatel> bbery that totally depends on what you're loading.  i read a fantastic set of articles about why that's not necessarily the best strategy.  can't remember what they all were though.
[09:35:36] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I dunno - I had a buddy go through it with them and he said it was pretty brutal.  i don't think i'm the kind of dev they're looking for tbh.
[09:36:11] <duch_kazatel> this is apparently for a new team they're building.  they're doing an accelerated recruitment drive for this one, too, so the competition would be pretty fierce.
[09:36:40] <BillCriswell> Sounds pretty fun haha.
[09:37:03] <bberry> i feel like if you were loading scripts in the <head> then you would do that for a very specific purpose, like some sort of dom generation or something.
[09:37:21] <bberry> but still all the ones that arent for that specific purpose, if any, should be at the bottom of the body
[09:37:44] <duch_kazatel> bberry this article isn't directly about it but should give you some insight: https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/20/script-injected-async-scripts-considered-harmful/
[09:37:56] <duch_kazatel> it's a much more complex subject than you'd think.
[09:41:20] <bberry> it seems race condition prone
[09:41:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: How do you suppose they got a hold of your information?
[09:41:50] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell linkedin :)
[09:42:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm connected to some pretty decent names on there, including an employee or two.
[09:42:49] <BillCriswell> Most of mine are recruiters and like.. teacher friends haha
[09:43:03] <litropy> I'm using jquery mobile. Does anyone have any idea as to why this happens: when I view the page source, my link looks like this: myfolder/mylink.html yet when I Right-click > Copy Link Address, my link's folder is erroneously redundant: myfolder/myfolder/mylink.html
[09:43:48] <litropy> Actually, it had been made absolute upon Copy: https://mysite.com/myfolder/myfolder/mylink.html
[09:43:55] <BillCriswell> My picture doesn't screen professional either haha
[09:44:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you'd do well at our company ;)
[09:44:49] <duch_kazatel> there's a gif floating out there of this dude dancing around in a spandex bodysuit while talking on a phone - it came from one of our videos.
[09:45:11] <BillCriswell> Sounds awesome haha
[09:45:27] <oomkiller> code: http://bpaste.net/show/390485/, I can see in the logs the object with responseText as an attribute, but by accessing I only get undefined, can someone tell me why?
[09:45:54] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller because the console log is happening before the ajax request completes.
[09:46:06] <duch_kazatel> put them inside the .done(); callback instead.
[09:47:42] <oomkiller> duch_kazatel: yeah works thanks
[09:48:06] <duch_kazatel> welcome to async
[09:51:59] <oomkiller> hehe, yeah always forget about that...
[09:57:21] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: I need your help again :/
[10:00:41] <duch_kazatel> there are over 780 people in this channel other than you and me - you don't need just my help :)
[10:00:43] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[10:01:10] * Daghdha points at ceiling
[10:01:18] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha++
[10:01:34] <Daghdha> carefull.. that may cause an overflow
[10:02:17] <Daghdha> gonna read up on more jquery later, still not clear when i get collections and when i get objects
[10:02:39] <decx> i just realized that a revolution by definition always ends where it started
[10:03:08] <Daghdha> that would be the 're' part at work
[10:03:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Isn't that the worst? Shit that should be immediately obvious just isn't some times.
[10:04:09] <Daghdha> it sounds like one of those things you realize when you are stoned.
[10:04:13] <BillCriswell> A revolutionary should really be called a... "half-a-revolutionary"
[10:04:25] <BillCriswell> Since things are usually... different?
[10:04:31] <decx> Daghdha well it's 19:04 sooo...
[10:04:41] <BillCriswell> I said it once... I'll say it again "fucking words".
[10:04:41] <Daghdha> semivolutionary
[10:05:21] <BillCriswell> Time to rewrite the history books.
[10:09:08] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha "collections" vs "objects" don't exist ; ) they're always objects.
[10:09:35] <duch_kazatel> jquery selectors return array-like objects.
[10:09:37] <decx> well in jquery an object can be a collection, but not all objects are collections
[10:10:21] <duch_kazatel> i avoid the word "collection" because it confuses newbies sometimes.
[10:16:06] <walidvb> looking for a plugin to detect if a user has started scrolling
[10:16:18] <walidvb> trying to use it to trigger a carousel change
[10:16:20] <duch_kazatel> walidvb no need - just attach a listener to the scroll event on window
[10:16:23] <litropy> I'm using jquery mobile. Does anyone have any idea as to why this happens: when I view the page source, my link looks like this: myfolder/mylink.html yet when I Right-click > Copy Link Address, my link's folder is erroneously redundant: https://mysite.com/myfolder/myfolder/mylink.html
[10:16:31] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/8tznA/5/
[10:16:44] <walidvb> was trying to go vanilla, cause i need to trigger the even only once
[10:17:06] <duch_kazatel> walidvb then use .one() from jquery.
[10:17:51] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: well, you need to be able tp scroll again
[10:18:02] <duch_kazatel> walidvb huh?\
[10:18:13] <walidvb> check http://collinfontaine.ch/
[10:18:29] <walidvb> i want the same interaction
[10:19:04] <nhulea> you how many people say happy friday now ? Is this the new tgif or something cause its really starting to piss me off
[10:19:13] <walidvb> happy friday
[10:19:16] <nhulea> oh ... happy friday
[10:19:24] <walidvb> i just found out it was friday, actually
[10:20:11] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: see?
[10:20:35] <nhulea> welcome to friday walidvb
[10:20:36] <BillCriswell> It's not happy friday till 5.
[10:20:37] <duch_kazatel> walidvb sorry got pulled onto something else.
[10:20:46] <walidvb> np :)
[10:20:53] <walidvb> BillCriswell: what time is it?
[10:21:21] <BillCriswell> 1:21
[10:21:32] <walidvb> ouch
[10:21:35] <walidvb> 19:21 here
[10:21:44] <duch_kazatel> 10:21 here
[10:21:45] <walidvb> have 8 ppl watching the game
[10:22:14] <BillCriswell> What's the US doing with all that soccer / football stuff? We won the first one.. have we played since then?
[10:22:33] <walidvb> BillCriswell: no idea
[10:22:37] <duch_kazatel> not yet.
[10:22:39] <duch_kazatel> sundayi think?
[10:24:09] <pitolu_> Hello ----  how would i select the p without the button inside it  --- so like $('.class').ButIgnoreChildren  http://jsfiddle.net/v65XE/
[10:24:19] <BillCriswell> Ah, nice.
[10:24:38] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ wat - selecting the P includes the button.
[10:24:51] <BillCriswell> pitolu_: Do you want to remove the button instead?
[10:24:52] <decx> the next game is the most important one for the us, if they draw portugal they have a realistic chance of going through to round of 16
[10:24:52] <walidvb> pitolu_: wrap the yargh in a span
[10:25:12] <decx> sunday sunday sunday....
[10:25:23] <pitolu_> yeah in jQ how would you select the contents of the div - yet ignore all the children
[10:25:25] <duch_kazatel> decx getting too american over there.
[10:25:25] <walidvb> still, anyone got a way to find out if a user has started scrolling and running a handler only once?
[10:25:33] <pitolu_> wait this doesn't make sense!
[10:25:38] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ that statement doesn't make sense ;)
[10:25:38] <walidvb> pitolu_: you can't
[10:25:42] <decx> hehe
[10:25:46] <walidvb> pitolu_: you'd need to wrap it in a div
[10:25:52] <duch_kazatel> "i want the contents of a thing without the contents.
[10:25:58] <walidvb> pitolu_: or maybe $('p').text()
[10:26:19] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ you mean you just want the text "yargh arg arg"?
[10:26:49] <walidvb> i guess
[10:27:50] <pitolu_> oh wait it does make sense --- yeah, duch_kazatel just the yargh and not the the span inside
[10:28:02] <duch_kazatel> there are a few ways to do that.  let me show you one :)
[10:28:29] <pitolu_> i was looking at not but that appears to be for specific things to avoid, i meant all children of the p tag
[10:29:26] <pitolu_> *(:not whatever)
[10:29:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v65XE/1/
[10:30:17] <duch_kazatel> there's also a "jquery way" but that's longer and funky.
[10:31:26] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: reading now thank you
[10:32:13] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: that is deceptively complex
[10:32:31] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[10:33:36] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: i was assuming there was some css type of selector for something like this
[10:34:29] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ there may be a CSS3 one, but i can't remember.  the issue is you're trying to target a node that's not really a node.
[10:34:35] <duch_kazatel> but it is ;)
[10:35:53] <decx> in native there is
[10:36:05] <duch_kazatel> what is it?
[10:36:11] <decx> previousSibling on .inlinebutton1 would be the textnode
[10:36:31] <duch_kazatel> native js you mean?
[10:36:35] <decx> yes
[10:36:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah that i'm aware of.  you can also find the first child node of that p that is a textnode.
[10:37:01] <duch_kazatel> but no css selector.
[10:37:14] <decx> right
[10:37:36] <duch_kazatel> :D
[10:40:11] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: i'm trying to step through it and i'm having trouble following the logic -- when you ran each did that make one text element and one span element?
[10:40:28] <pitolu_> to be applied to by the function?
[10:40:45] <duch_kazatel> nothing made any elements in there.
[10:40:54] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery contents()
[10:40:57] <pitolu_> im saying in the system
[10:41:04] <pitolu_> in the code
[10:41:12] <duch_kazatel> right - nothing is making any elements in the JS.
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> the text in that p - the stuff you wanted - is an actual node.
[10:41:57] <pitolu_> thats not what i mean - each is defining the selection what does it produce
[10:42:04] <pitolu_> 2 items?
[10:42:14] <bansar> how can I remove zoom effect on http://ukyopencart.meximas.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=44 page
[10:42:15] <duch_kazatel> each doesn't define anything.
[10:42:25] <duch_kazatel> it's enumerating through what .contents() returned.
[10:42:27] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[10:43:15] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: its hard for me to explain this sorry - you are selecting contents and running each on them
[10:43:36] <pitolu_> a bag of apples has 3 peices - you ran each
[10:43:39] <pitolu_> on 3 apples
[10:43:44] <duch_kazatel> okay?
[10:44:15] <pitolu_> in this bag of ".hello" how many things are there to run each on?
[10:44:41] <pitolu_> meaning the text isn't in a div, so its not one its just a free floating string?
[10:45:14] <duch_kazatel> the text is in a node.
[10:45:36] <pitolu_> thats one node of text and one span?
[10:45:37] <duch_kazatel> console.log($('.hello').contents().length); try that.
[10:45:42] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[10:46:14] <duch_kazatel> the contents of that <p> include a text node that is distinct from the span.
[10:46:27] <decx> 2 actually
[10:46:36] <pitolu_> and that text node is one 'piece'?
[10:46:36] <duch_kazatel> well, direct children i mean.
[10:46:50] <duch_kazatel> that span includes a botton node and that button node also contains a text node.
[10:46:54] <decx> a textnode with arg, a span and an empty textnode
[10:47:21] <pitolu_> div> <text node >  <span> </div>   two things in there
[10:48:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v65XE/2/
[10:48:26] <duch_kazatel> and there are empty textnodes not represented via those comments.
[10:51:02] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: amazing - i see
[10:51:19] <duch_kazatel> welcome to the magic of the DOM
[10:54:23] <GreekFreak> hi all
[10:55:12] <GreekFreak> When I set a class of an input box to "ui-state-error", it changes the way the input box looks (makes it more 'square'). How do I get it to not do that?
[10:55:21] <duch_kazatel> overriding your CSS>
[10:55:27] <duch_kazatel> or use a different class.
[10:56:07] <silverdust> can I edit contents of clone before appending it to a page?
[10:56:30] <silverdust> I'm cloning an input with name="banner1"
[10:56:34] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, I just set the addClass("ui-state-error") as per jQuery. Why would it change the way it looks?
[10:56:50] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak are you using jquery ui?
[10:56:58] <duch_kazatel> silverdust you should be able to, yes.
[10:57:06] <silverdust> for each clone, I'll like to add 1 to the banner count i.e first clone == name="banner2"
[10:57:31] <duch_kazatel> silverdust .clone() puts things into a fragment iirc - should be fine.
[10:57:40] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, yes
[10:57:42] <balazs> hello. does anyone have example code for a dropdown, where the user can add a new value ?
[10:57:46] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak that would be why.
[10:57:52] <BillCriswell> + $(this).attr('name').slice(5) + 1
[10:58:08] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, what do you mean? it defaults it to the original look?
[10:58:16] <silverdust> like clone.attr('name', 'banner2') ?
[10:58:18] <BillCriswell> Holy fuck I can't count.
[10:58:21] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ GreekFreak
[10:58:31] <BillCriswell> .slice(6)
[10:58:33] <duch_kazatel> SilverKey basically.
[10:58:40] <duch_kazatel> where's the bot :(
[10:58:44] <duch_kazatel> err, silverdust
[10:58:45] <silverdust> I don't know the approach to take
[10:58:51] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak can you share an example?
[10:59:11] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: ok sooooooo - you select contents and say in each NODE that exists -- run this if statement that says { if that node is a Text type node then.... take the string of text and.. and add it to itself?
[10:59:19] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, there's nothing to paste. I just do addClass("ui-state-error") when my validation fails. And for some reason it changes the way the box looks to a more "squarish old style" look
[10:59:25] <GreekFreak> not the one I have
[11:00:02] <oomkiller> My if-condition ( var == "E-Mail" ) does not work, is that somethin with the - ?
[11:00:12] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak your CSS would be changing that.
[11:00:23] <duch_kazatel> jquery-ui or your CSS, rather.
[11:00:41] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller var == "E-Mail doesn't make sense.
[11:00:53] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ huh?
[11:01:22] <duch_kazatel> pitolu_ no - look up above that.  i created a var and am appending to that var with each textnode.
[11:01:24] <oomkiller> duch_kazatal yeah was just an example for an variable
[11:01:32] <duch_kazatel> and then running a .trim() on the result to remove the extra whitespace.
[11:01:39] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, but I don't touch that element or the box. All I do is add that class. The minute I "blur" it goes back to normal
[11:01:56] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak dunno then.  you said no need for a paste so it's hard to help.
[11:02:39] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: Can you help with an example. I have this http://jsbin.com/rivoreso/1/edit
[11:03:20] <duch_kazatel> silverdust your clone var is like any other node - run your stuff against that.
[11:03:58] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, I said I don't have anything to paste lol. all I do is "my_input.addClass("ui-state-error")" And I don't touch the inputs in my CSS so I don't know what to paste lol
[11:04:32] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak i asked you to recreate it - if you can't reproduce in jsfiddle/jsbin, that means your CSS is doing something it shouldn't.
[11:05:04] <silverdust> ok duch_kazatel
[11:05:58] <oomkiller> actually my if-condition is (  username != "Username"  || email != "E-Mail" || pw != "Password" ) which always gives true, when I remove the condition with "E-Mail" in it it works as expected
[11:06:01] <duch_kazatel> silverdust http://jsfiddle.net/r2vyz/
[11:06:12] <BillCriswell> silverdust: http://jsbin.com/rivoreso/3/edit?html,js,output going for something liek this?
[11:06:43] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller first, you want !==
[11:06:53] <duch_kazatel> second, try to console.log() each of those values before you hit your IF.
[11:08:59] <oomkiller> duch_kazatel with !== same behaviour, I'm already doing an console.log before
[11:09:10] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller okay - and what are you getting with those console logs?
[11:10:05] <oomkiller> duch_kazatel: the correct values ( Username, E-Mail and Password )
[11:10:28] <oomkiller> when I'm only checking username and password it works
[11:10:38] <silverdust> thanks guys
[11:10:44] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller you're not making sense.

[11:11:45] <BillCriswell> I love how a slight type with ems will give you a gigantic mess of a website haha.
[11:11:54] <BillCriswell> 12.8em instead of .8 haah
[11:12:42] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, here you go. This is just a copy paste from the CSS that the Themeroller created. http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/6QvVQ/
[11:12:56] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, you'll see what I mean tehre
[11:13:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6QvVQ/1/ btw
[11:13:39] <duch_kazatel> and that looks normal to me.
[11:14:14] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, ok. I just opened it on Chrome and it looks fine. Try it on Firefox
[11:14:28] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak i am.  it looks normal to me.
[11:14:55] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, really? The red one looks square, the other has rounded corners
[11:15:03] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/1i2a2VO.png
[11:15:08] <duch_kazatel> you mean the drop shadow?
[11:15:43] <duch_kazatel> oomkiller did you see that fiddle i pasted?
[11:16:19] <oomkiller> duch_kazatel: and I found my failure, I have an space at the end of my variable :/
[11:16:43] <duch_kazatel> $.trim() is your friend there then ;)
[11:17:22] <oomkiller> yeah thanks
[11:17:23] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, take a look at this of Firefox : http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/6QvVQ/2/
[11:17:56] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak yep.  looks like jquery ui to mne.
[11:17:58] <duch_kazatel> *me
[11:18:27] <duch_kazatel> same thing in chrome
[11:18:40] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, ok thank you. Suppose nothing I can do about it
[11:18:43] <GreekFreak> thanks for trying
[11:18:47] <duch_kazatel> GreekFreak huh?>
[11:18:49] <duch_kazatel> you can though.
[11:18:58] <GreekFreak> oh? how?
[11:19:07] <duch_kazatel> i told you earlier - override the CSS
[11:19:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6QvVQ/3/
[11:19:13] <duch_kazatel> you can do whatever you want.
[11:19:50] <duch_kazatel> you know how to use your inspector, right?
[11:20:04] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, but the down arrow looks different. Isn't that controlled by the browser?
[11:20:44] <duch_kazatel> this is when specificity would have been nice - styling form elements is a massive PITA.
[11:20:51] <jParkton> duch I cant remember the shorthand for creating a div with some info is it $('<div>', {'attribute:value '})?
[11:20:52] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:21:21] <GreekFreak> duch_kazatel, lol So I am finding out haha
[11:22:25] <duch_kazatel> jParkton $('<div>', {attribute:value })?
[11:22:35] <jParkton> I dont know
[11:22:43] <jParkton> maybe I assumed wrongly what it did
[11:22:45] <jParkton> lol
[11:23:24] <duch_kazatel> one sec i'll show you in a bit
[11:23:39] <pitolu_> duch_kazatel: i'm still drooling here over your example :)
[11:27:41] <IRConan> hi, I'm seeing some behaviour I don't understand with jquery-ui tabs being created in a $(document).ready() callback
[11:27:52] <IRConan> seems like it goes into a loop, re-calling that callback
[11:29:44] <bansar> does jquery return .css on the fly?
[11:31:50] <BillCriswell> bansar: I think yes is the answer to your question.
[11:31:57] <BillCriswell> Not 100% what you mean by "on the fly" though.
[11:32:50] <jParkton> 'a' fly?
[11:32:52] <jParkton> lol
[11:32:53] <bansar> BillCriswell: asking because I am changing width of an element on a webpage but can not see effect on that, dont know from where that is being fixed.
[11:32:56] <jParkton> ohai Bill
[11:33:14] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Ayyy
[11:33:29] <jParkton> bansar: if you inspect the element it will display the styles being knocked out by something els
[11:33:30] <BillCriswell> bansar: Hmm.. you'll probably have to use .width()
[11:33:33] <jParkton> +e
[11:34:21] <bansar> I want to change width of product image on http://ukyopencart.meximas.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=44. on inspecting it shows "element.style" it seems that is coming from jquery,
[11:35:14] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[11:35:39] <duch_kazatel> jParkton it's $('<div/>', {'someProp': 'someVal'}
[11:36:07] <jParkton> duch sweet
[11:36:09] <jParkton> I was close
[11:36:11] <jParkton> lol
[11:36:36] <jParkton> bansar: it looks like all it has is an inline style display:block
[11:37:38] <jParkton> .product-info .image { is only applying the text-align it is being overridden by the bootstrap.css
[11:38:03] <jParkton> make the products an array and assign a id to it ?
[11:39:28] <bansar> jParkton: could you please look now, changed a little. all I want is to display product image in full size in inside red border http://ukyopencart.meximas.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=44#!prettyPhoto
[11:40:17] <jParkton> not found
[11:40:24] <jParkton> I went back to id=44 though
[11:40:43] <jParkton> there is a grey ...block? that pushes right
[11:40:53] <jParkton> is that what you want to change width?
[11:41:31] <bansar> jParkton: http://ukyopencart.meximas.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=44 , I want see that product covering that gray background
[11:44:20] <jParkton> what is that rel="position: 'right'"
[11:46:08] <decx> looks like an invalid use of rel to me
[11:46:31] <jParkton> there are a few invalid uses in there actually on looking into it
[11:46:42] <jParkton> is that being populated by your php?
[11:47:21] <bansar> jParkton: yes it is , from Opencart
[11:47:42] <jParkton> those my be mucking up your styling
[11:47:56] <jParkton> most of your stylesheet.css isnt being applied
[11:52:06] <bansar> jParkton: they are not unused, I just removed rel="position: 'right'" and can`t see extra images in same div more, it goes to new blank page
[11:52:53] <bansar> can you help me to remove this zoom feature on mouseover?
[12:13:01] <jenia> hello
[12:13:16] <jenia> i have a listview in which I have a form input type="submit"
[12:14:21] <duch_kazatel> good times
[12:14:27] <duch_kazatel> i have a page where we sell products.
[12:14:28] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[12:14:46] <jenia> when i press the submit button, jquery-mobile uses ajax to load something. (there's the ajax loading animation on the screen) and then when the server does a redirect, the browser doesnt respond
[12:14:51] <jenia> lol. yea
[12:15:11] <duch_kazatel> jenia "the browser doesn't respond" meaning...?
[12:15:47] <jenia> the redirect doesnt happen. the becomes empty but the url doesnt change nor is there anytning on the screen
[12:15:54] <jenia> the screen* becomes
[12:16:23] <jenia> i tried this:               <li><input id="submit" type="submit" rel="external" data-ajax="false" value="Login"/></li>
[12:16:36] <jenia> by the way, i;m using jquery mobile
[12:16:40] <duch_kazatel> you mentioned that.
[12:16:47] <jenia> yea hehe
[12:21:35] <BillCriswell> Damn content-box
[12:21:44] <duch_kazatel> it strikes again!
[12:21:55] <BillCriswell> 'tis a real jerk.
[12:25:43] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC
[12:26:39] <BillCriswell> I'm glad there's people out there doing shit like this.
[12:26:51] <jenia> duch_kazatel,  i know how to fix it.
[12:27:18] <jenia> its obvious once you know the answer. you put data-ajax="false" into the form as attribute
[12:27:42] <duch_kazatel> jenia like i said, i don't know anything about jquery ui, but cool.
[12:28:07] <thebope> haha BillCriswell, no luck with out boxing-model?
[12:28:48] <BillCriswell> thebope: Sadly not.
[12:29:03] <thebope> That blows
[12:29:39] <thebope> I was like wow late
[12:29:41] <thebope> but PST
[12:31:35] <BillCriswell> Today will mark a week straight of me going to the gym. It's not nearly as terrible as I though it was going to be.
[12:32:52] <jenia> hi again everyone.
[12:33:04] <thebope> It gets really addicting
[12:33:10] <thebope> I did my first stand up comedy show this week
[12:33:13] <thebope> Hi Jenia
[12:33:30] <thebope> and it also was not bad! In fact I quite enjoyed it
[12:33:42] <thebope> I barely rehearsed, next week should be way better
[12:34:04] <theahindle> Hey - I'm trying to use jquery-numeric.js but it doesn't seem to be working with $('input[type=number]').numeric() because the inputs are generated afterwards - is it possible to do this with .on?
[12:34:09] <thebope> Here's the link if you want it BillCriswell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p1Vx3S0hQk
[12:34:23] <thebope> You can see the goofy guy you've been talking to this whole time! Just be careful, I say fuck the entire time
[12:34:36] <thebope> but the bits themselves are work safe besides that
[12:34:55] <BillCriswell> thebope: I'll check it out.
[12:35:07] <thebope> theahindle, I think its best bets to use the api they provide
[12:35:34] <thebope> BillCriswell, it'll be better next week
[12:35:37] <thebope> but its only 4 minutes
[12:36:19] <BillCriswell> Lot's of "fucks" hah
[12:36:27] <thebope> yea so many hahaha
[12:36:32] <thebope> I didn't rehearse really
[12:36:35] <thebope> And it kind of shows
[12:37:16] <thebope> But since then I've been writing bits a lot
[12:37:40] <thebope> and practicing my delivery. Learning the art of the pause
[12:37:57] <thebope> For a first show I'd say it was as good as could be.
[12:38:12] <thebope> but thats just because I want to go back which to me is the big success
[12:39:46] <BillCriswell> Yeah it was enjoyable. I think if you rehearsed a bit it would of been better.
[12:40:21] <thebope> yea, I set it up, and then just was so busy. I was going to rehearse at lunch but ended up buying the camcorder I used to record it because I knew I'd want a quality recording to analyze from
[12:40:24] <thebope> Thanks though
[12:40:43] <BillCriswell> Good shit.
[12:41:45] <BillCriswell> That has to be nerve wrecking.
[12:42:00] <thebope> Actually, I had nerves all day, but then when I got to the venue, I just couldn't wait to get up there
[12:42:17] <thebope> and if I had had my name drawn earlier I think the show woulda been a bit better actually
[12:42:26] <thebope> but instead I drank like a beer too many in the two hours of waiting haha
[12:42:36] <BillCriswell> Ah, yeah.
[12:42:53] <BillCriswell> If I had a few beers I think I'd be more comfortable. After that, no idea.
[12:42:58] <thebope> haha yea exactly
[12:43:02] <thebope> it's parabolic
[12:43:13] <thebope> I feel like I had a lot more energy than most of the people I saw though
[12:43:40] <thebope> It actually sounds like a bad stand up show with some good jokes sprinkled in
[12:43:48] <BillCriswell> Good stuff. I haven't been to a comedy show in a while.
[12:43:52] <thebope> Yea, it's fun
[12:44:39] <decx> i went to a german comedy show and had to stab myself into the knee with a rusty spoon to ease the pain of the cringe
[12:45:13] <thebope> yea some people are so bad
[12:45:17] <thebope> and all the jokes are about sex
[12:45:35] <thebope> and to me, while that is a form of humor, I want to be able to send the recordings to my company and my parents and everyone
[12:45:43] <decx> you know how there's a prejudice that germans aren't funny, it's all true
[12:45:52] <thebope> So I actually feel, not to brag, that I'm already starting at a step above in terms of quality in some ways
[12:46:02] <thebope> Because of the wide range of audience I have to appeal too
[12:46:19] <thebope> Ich ban un frankfuter
[12:46:22] <BillCriswell> thebope: Good stuff.
[12:47:04] <thebope> thanks man I appreciate it
[12:47:39] <thebope> I'm actually really excited about it all haha
[12:47:54] <thebope> Hopefully you'll see me on TV one day
[12:48:06] <thebope> and then be sure to find me on twitter or something (cboppert) and reach out
[12:48:12] <BillCriswell> decx: My friend Annet is German and she's pretty funny. It mostly comes out when she's drinking and uncomfortable though. She'll be brutally honest with whoever she's talking to and it's usually hilarious.
[12:48:13] <thebope> and I'll mail some signed photos ;-)
[12:48:24] <BillCriswell> Haha good deal.
[12:49:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Then again, not sure she's trying to be funny.
[12:49:09] <thebope> haha lol
[12:49:25] <decx> hehe good old drunk honesty
[12:50:19] <BillCriswell> The only kind of honesty haha
[12:52:18] <BillCriswell> It could also be her accent plus the honestly that makes it funny.
[12:54:30] <thebope> and the few beers on the listeners end never hurt
[12:55:36] <BillCriswell> If I don't have a few beers in me I am thinking way too hard.
[12:55:47] <thebope> Man the internets creepy
[12:56:06] <thebope> You never went to college?
[12:56:08] <thebope> That's awesome
[12:56:11] <thebope> Although college was fun
[12:56:20] <thebope> I need... more of a life
[12:56:25] <thebope> http://www.whatscookin.com/#C|872|1050
[12:56:28] <thebope> I figure that has to be you
[12:56:29] <thebope> lol
[12:56:37] <BillCriswell> Haha it is.
[12:56:51] <thebope> thats sweet man
[12:57:04] <thebope> Your kittens are adorable. Looks like a wonderful life. Pretty gal!
[12:57:06] <thebope> Living it up!
[12:57:13] <BillCriswell> Yeah, got a job right out of high school.
[12:57:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, they're cool, she's cool, no complaints.
[12:57:36] <thebope> yea man, I mean, really, thats the american dream
[12:58:13] <BillCriswell> Now I want to watch that Rodney Mullen video again
[12:58:17] <BillCriswell> and Stop Making Sense.
[12:58:23] <thebope> Talking Heads?
[12:58:28] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:58:30] <thebope> I listen to them every day almost on Spotify
[12:58:39] <winny___> hello, if I have an <input type='button'> and I have a keypress listener on the document, how do I prevent spacebar from activating the button? calling the event's stopPropagation() and preventDefault() methods do not stop this.
[12:58:42] <thebope> I just have on gigantic playlist that I add everything I love too
[12:58:46] <thebope> Oh wow jquery talk
[12:59:13] <BillCriswell> thebope: I can guarantee I listen to at least one of their songs a day haha.
[12:59:19] <BillCriswell> There's times it'll be all I listen to.
[12:59:19] <thebope> winny___, Couldn't you wrap the inside of your keypress function in a check for whether the key pressed was a space bar?
[12:59:27] <thebope> Yea, Stop Making Sense is amazing
[12:59:33] <thebope> I have that and one of their other elements
[12:59:55] <BillCriswell> winny___: Why are you trying to keep space from doing that?
[13:00:35] <thebope> winny___, what about .keypress(function(e) { if (!(e == 32)) { your code here} })
[13:00:46] <BillCriswell> thebope: Fear of Music has been my favorite this week.
[13:00:53] <BillCriswell> It's... weird.
[13:01:05] <thebope> that thats your favorite?
[13:01:17] <thebope> I've been loving the Tom Tom Club haha, but its such a classic
[13:01:19] <BillCriswell> No, the album in general.
[13:01:41] <thebope> The main singer who's just adding quips makes the song so good
[13:01:44] <thebope> "Shore was!"
[13:02:37] <BillCriswell> thebope: Not sure if you ever saw the whole video but this "interview" is good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE-mxVxFXLg
[13:03:14] <thebope> okay, Heaven just came on so I'll watch it after haha
[13:04:07] <winny___> hi thebope and BillCriswell. I need to suppress the button activation because this page i'm working on is a very simple media control for a music player... so I don't want to activate play/pause **button** if **spacebar** is pressed. Here is what i have right now: https://github.com/winny-/HermesRemote/blob/0f55ca73ba5685c3120cbfa30716e41c6e980475/hermes.app.js#L17-L38
[13:05:00] <thebope> I think Little Creatures is the other album of theirs I own
[13:05:04] <thebope> although everythings on Spotify
[13:05:16] <winny___> Little Creatures++
[13:06:48] <thebope> yea its a good one
[13:07:38] <thebope> winny___, you can't add the if loop I suggested? At line 18 put if (!(e == 32)) { *wrap your code*}
[13:09:34] <MikeD_> .empty() vs .html('') vs .children().remove()  <-- which one do i use & why?
[13:09:47] <duch_kazatel> .empty()
[13:10:00] <duch_kazatel> because it's explicit in what it does.
[13:10:01] <Vxn> hello everyone
[13:12:00] <Vxn> Can someone tell me if this is jquery  "$('#more_rows').click(function(){ $.get('/some/file',{submode: 'row', num: $('#some_table_row_id tr').length, count: 2}..."
[13:12:09] <duch_kazatel> "if this is jquery" lol
[13:12:12] <duch_kazatel> yes, that uses jquery
[13:12:19] <Vxn> ok, thanks
[13:12:38] <Vxn> I was trying to learn how the .get works, but the docs I found online seemed to indicate it only took an index as the argument
[13:12:46] <Vxn> I'm sorry, not really familiar with jquery
[13:12:52] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[13:13:00] <Vxn> can you point me at somedocs that explain this use?
[13:13:03] <Vxn> thank you
[13:13:14] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/ is your best friend.
[13:13:21] <thebope> yea it really is
[13:13:25] <thebope> duch_kazatel, you're funny man haha
[13:13:26] <duch_kazatel> any time you see something you don't understand, go there.
[13:13:34] <duch_kazatel> oh?
[13:13:46] <thebope> yea
[13:13:49] <Vxn> will do
[13:13:52] <thebope> in my opinion
[13:13:53] <winny___> thebope: sorry what do you mean? what does comparing an event object to an integer do? Also I am checking for space on line 24
[13:14:05] <winny___> I can't seem to reproduce the problem with a fiddle... this is weird.
[13:14:06] <thebope> the event is the keypress
[13:14:11] <tables> <div id="foo"><a href="#">mylink</a></div>              <-- when i click mylink, how do i change the contents of div with id='foo' ?
[13:14:12] <thebope> so if you don't want space to activate something
[13:14:20] <thebope> then wrap that part in a check for whether its a space
[13:14:22] <thebope> and if it is a space
[13:14:24] <thebope> don't do anything
[13:14:28] <winny___> why?
[13:14:31] <duch_kazatel> tables ...
[13:14:36] <thebope> why what?
[13:14:44] <duch_kazatel> by changing $('#foo')
[13:14:51] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: that page doesn't seem to explain the "submode: num: count:" portion of the command I'm seeing
[13:14:52] <winny___> i want the space to send an ajax command, but not the space depressing the <input type='button'>
[13:15:02] <duch_kazatel> Vxn yes it does.  that's the "
[13:15:06] <tables> duch_kazatel, i need code
[13:15:10] <duch_kazatel> *"data" argument.
[13:15:11] <thebope> huh?
[13:15:31] <duch_kazatel> tables how would you edit the content of any container in jquery?
[13:15:34] <duch_kazatel> this is basic stuff.
[13:15:39] <thebope> then maybe check if space and call your ajax call?
[13:16:03] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: I'm not familiar with jquery, so basic or not, I don't yet understand that part
[13:16:12] <Vxn> it seems to be copying only PART of the row
[13:16:21] <Vxn> leaving out some of the columns, and I can't figure out why
[13:16:24] <duch_kazatel> vxm one sec, let me show you.
[13:17:12] <winny___> thebope: e is the event object, so e == 32 would always be false
[13:17:17] <duch_kazatel> vxm here it is formatted more sanely: http://jsfiddle.net/v4rb7/
[13:17:26] <thebope> e should be the keypress
[13:17:29] <thebope> on a keypress handler
[13:17:32] <winny___> i think you mean e.which, but i do check -- 0x32 is 20
[13:18:12] <thebope> oh yea e.which works well
[13:18:17] <thebope> Sorry I'm distracted
[13:18:19] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: thank you.  let me add the rest
[13:18:23] <thebope> tabbing between this and work

[13:22:14] <thebope> Ahh, learning to use the bots
[13:22:33] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: to be clear, I know html well, but I'm not following jquery.  When I look at this jquery code, I'd expect it to add two new rows, each with the same content as in the row marked with the id "some_table_row_id".  But instead, what I'm seeing is 90% of the cells in the row get copied.  I'm trying to understand why.
[13:23:55] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/F2jxt/   <-- if i click on the link, how do i make the div change with a new link?   then if i click on that new link, how do i make the div change into the old link?
[13:24:23] <duch_kazatel> tables look into event delegation with .on()
[13:24:37] <duch_kazatel> Vxn so wait what line in particular are you confused with then?
[13:24:42] <tables> can you gimme a pointer?
[13:24:59] <duch_kazatel> tables $(parent).on('event', 'child', function(){});
[13:25:25] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: well I -think- the .get is grabbing the page, then this portion I assume is making 5 new rows: "{submode: 'row', num: $('#bulk_add_users_table tr').length, count: 5}"
[13:25:40] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:25:48] <edgarmarquez> ok. the code is this one http://jsfiddle.net/egemdark/98APQ/
[13:25:57] <duch_kazatel> vxn that's sending data as apart of the request to the server.
[13:26:03] <edgarmarquez> but when i try to execute it on my site i get this error: ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined
[13:26:04] <duch_kazatel> vxn look at the docs again - that's the "data" part.
[13:26:14] <edgarmarquez> im a total noob on jquery
[13:26:14] <duch_kazatel> edgarmarquez that means you don't have jquery leaded on your page.
[13:26:20] <edgarmarquez> lol.. but i have checked
[13:26:24] <edgarmarquez> and the jquery library
[13:26:39] <duch_kazatel> oh i see it now lol
[13:26:40] <edgarmarquez> loads before the script
[13:26:41] <duch_kazatel> jQuery
[13:26:44] <duch_kazatel> lowercase the j
[13:27:11] <edgarmarquez> ok
[13:27:13] <edgarmarquez> let me try
[13:28:30] <winny___> thebope: so i found the issue -- pressing spacebar when a button is focused also sends a click event to the button in addition to a keypress event -- http://jsfiddle.net/x7WBy/1/ (watch your developer console)
[13:28:31] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: you obviously know more than me about this, but can you explain then, why when this bit of code gets called, it adds rows?
[13:28:52] <duch_kazatel> Vxn because it's getting evaluated.
[13:29:04] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: If I could understand the specific details of HOW it is adding the rows, then I think I can fix how it is only getting some of the cells in the row instead of all of them
[13:29:17] <decx> thebope i still dont get it but whatever http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9R3YP/
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> vxn thae section that starts with "submode" does not do that.
[13:29:51] <duch_kazatel> vxn $('#some_table_row_id tr:last').after(data); DOES
[13:30:19] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks
[13:30:21] <thebope> wow you have a jsfiddle account? I didn't even know that was a thing
[13:30:26] <thebope> lemme check it out this sounds really cool
[13:30:37] <Vxn> so that code looks like it goes to the last tr and inserts the data it grabs after
[13:30:40] <thebope> Maybe over the weekend I'll come up with some ideas and shoot them by you Monday
[13:30:42] <Vxn> ok, then I think I know what is wrong
[13:30:52] <Vxn> by DEFAULT some of the columns are hidden
[13:31:01] <Vxn> perhaps it ignores hidden columns?
[13:31:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:31:05] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[13:31:23] <thebope> I'm emailing it to myself now I'll check it out on Saturday or Sunday
[13:34:22] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: what I mean is, perhaps the get is grabbing the page as it receives it - with some columns HIDDEN.  Then when it does the after, the data is missing those hidden columns
[13:34:27] <Vxn> granted, I am merely guessing here
[13:36:08] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/F2jxt/     <-- how can i click on the link and make the div change with another link?   then when i click that next link, it goes back to the previous link?
[13:36:16] <Vxn> the part about this theory that doesn't make sense is, there are other hidden columns that DO get copied when it makes new rows...
[13:36:36] <duch_kazatel> vxn "the get is grabbing the page as it recieves it" - huh?
[13:36:52] <duch_kazatel> what is the get calling?
[13:37:43] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: it is calling a page that has table data
[13:37:55] <duch_kazatel> tables event delegation.
[13:37:56] <Vxn> but the call it makes is before the user has typed anything in
[13:38:02] <Vxn> so it is empty table rows
[13:38:12] <Vxn> this jquery stuff is very clever
[13:38:25] <duch_kazatel> vxn could you re-link the fiddle?
[13:38:44] <Vxn> looks like when they click on the "add rows" button, it grabs the page and then pulls five rows out of it to add to the existing page
[13:38:50] <Vxn> after the current last row
[13:38:55] <Vxn> yeah, moment
[13:39:42] <duch_kazatel> please don't pm me btw ;)
[13:39:47] <Vxn> oh, sorry
[13:41:02] <YokoBR> hey guys, i'm using jquery ui datepicker, with d/m/Y format, but i don't know how to store it as unix timestamp format.
[13:41:04] <duch_kazatel> okay, so this code is making a call to admin/bulk_add_users.m and appending submode, num, and count querystring params.  when that completes, it inserts whatever data it gets after the last tr.
[13:41:29] <duch_kazatel> that's literally all it does.  show_hide_fields(); and attachEvents(); seem a little odd.
[13:41:32] <duch_kazatel> especially the latter.
[13:42:03] <Vxn> I believe those are for ensuring the resulting fields are hidden if they are supposed to be
[13:42:17] <duch_kazatel> so what specific issue are you having then?
[13:42:36] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: it grabs only SOME of the columns in the rows
[13:42:40] <Vxn> so let me put it this way
[13:43:30] <Vxn> the page has say 15 total columns in each row.  3 of one type are hidden, 2 of another type are hidden, so only 10 visible.  When the code finishes, it makes 5 new rows, but they each have 13 columns.
[13:43:39] <Vxn> 2 of the hidden columns NEVER get copied
[13:43:48] <Vxn> ...but 3 of the hidden columns do.
[13:43:57] <Vxn> I'm trying to make it so that all columns get copied
[13:44:08] <duch_kazatel> then the issue is with the page you're calling.
[13:44:16] <Snerf> I am building a menu, and I manually add class ui-state-active is that is the current page, the the <a> item. but when I hover over any items in the menu bar, thats class gets removed automatically. How do I make it keep it?
[13:44:49] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Snerf
[13:44:49] <b-ot> Snerf: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:46:03] <SkyLeach> hey all
[13:47:14] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: I checked the page, and it includes all columns, so I'm not sure how the issue is with the page
[13:47:16] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/vEQ7C/       <-- can someone help me make the html work here?    I want to replace #content with #nav at the first click, then after the second click, I want to change #nav back #content.   (i might need to also choose correct jquery version)
[13:47:21] <Snerf> bah, what a pain, since I need to add jqueryui
[13:47:26] <tables> just the html, not jquery
[13:47:37] <duch_kazatel> Snerf not a pain at all, that's a checkbox.
[13:47:39] <duch_kazatel> tables really?
[13:47:48] <tables> duch_kazatel, yea
[13:47:52] <rivarun> i'm working inside a "$("input[type='file']").change(function (e)" construct, from which i'd like access to the input field as an Object, upon which i can call .val(""). but "this" gives me access to the File instead. how can i resolve the object from that?
[13:48:01] <tables> someone gamme that jquery code, but i dunno hwo to compliment it with html, lol
[13:48:07] <tables> so kinda like doing it in reverse i think
[13:48:15] <decx> what's the point of that even
[13:48:16] <duch_kazatel> tables you're not even trying.
[13:48:23] <duch_kazatel> you're becoming a help vampire lately.
[13:48:37] <duch_kazatel> vxm because the data is coming from that page.
[13:48:42] <Vxn> tables: what are you trying to make it do?
[13:48:55] <tables> I want to replace #content with #nav at the first click, then after the second click, I want to change #nav back #content.
[13:49:01] <duch_kazatel> if it's not copying all the columns, then something is wrong with where it's getting data from.  instead of hitting that page directly, look at the network request.
[13:49:09] <tables> back into #content
[13:49:10] <Snerf> duch_kazatel, for jquery, not jqueryui
[13:49:20] <duch_kazatel> Snerf for both.
[13:50:02] <duch_kazatel> Snerf well, jquery is a dropdown on jsfiddle, but jqui is just a checkbox -> http://i.imgur.com/OQbaXAf.png
[13:52:00] <Snerf> duch_kazatel, apparently not when you select jQuery 1.11.0, which is what I am using.. thats what was the confusion
[13:52:14] <duch_kazatel> Snerf because the versions are not lockstepped sadly.
[13:52:22] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to back down the jquery version
[13:52:29] <duch_kazatel> for most things, that's fine.
[13:53:01] <Snerf> ya. I just didnt see the jqueryui :)
[13:53:08] <duch_kazatel> yep
[13:53:30] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/vEQ7C/       <-- can someone help me make the html work here?    I want to replace #content with #nav at the first click, then after the second click, I want to change #nav back #content.   (i might need to also choose correct jquery version)
[13:53:41] <duch_kazatel> tables you're spamming the channel now.
[13:55:57] <Vxn> duch_kazatel: I figured it out, thanks.  There is a "context" established when the page is initially called which causes these specific columns to be populated.  When the jquery .get is run, the context isn't present, and thus the columns are suppressed
[13:56:07] <duch_kazatel> Vxn that makes sense.
[13:56:10] <Vxn> ...so they aren't there to be copied
[13:56:13] <duch_kazatel> do you see how that works now?
[13:56:29] <Vxn> yeah, thank you very much for your help
[13:56:34] <duch_kazatel> of course!
[13:56:37] <Snerf> duch_kazatel - http://jsfiddle.net/39b4L/1/
[13:56:42] <duch_kazatel> sometimes we just need to rubber duck a little :)
[13:56:47] <Vxn> my issue was that I didn't realize the context wasn't there, so I was looking in the wrong place
[13:56:57] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[13:57:20] <duch_kazatel> Snerf ah I see what you're saying.
[13:57:26] <w00tb3ast> is it possible to have an element scroll till it hits the div nav bar a the top of the page then become fixed?
[13:57:28] <Snerf> duch_kazatel.. ya.. its weird..
[13:57:30] <SkyLeach> can anyone tell me why the following is saying that obj.attr is not a function: http://jsfiddle.net/4gJYG/5/
[13:57:36] <duch_kazatel> it's actually not weird at all, Snerf
[13:57:49] <SkyLeach> (I"m attempting to load a list of id=value for a GET query
[13:57:50] <duch_kazatel> it's totally expected :) the smart way to to use you're own class for that.
[13:57:51] <Snerf> it is to me.. that seems like its doing the wrong thing
[13:58:17] <duch_kazatel> SkyLeach you want $(obj)
[13:58:32] <duch_kazatel> Snerf "active" should only be on one thing at a time normally.
[13:58:51] <SkyLeach> ty duch_kazatel
[13:59:11] <Snerf> duch_kazatel, which it is.. as ui-state-focus is what goes when you do a hover.. it removes the active state
[13:59:24] <duch_kazatel> Snerf right, because now you have another "active" selection.
[13:59:49] <Snerf> well.. well, that just seems totally wrong.. but so be it
[13:59:57] <duch_kazatel> that's how the library is designed.
[14:00:10] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet 99% of cases expect that behavior ;)
[14:00:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/39b4L/2/
[14:00:37] <duch_kazatel> do something like this.
[14:00:38] <Snerf> i wouldnt ever expect that.. as I want a certain item to be "active" with that class..
[14:00:56] <duch_kazatel> Snerf you're misunderstanding what "active" means in this context.
[14:01:30] <bansar> is it possible to know  by inspect element which method from which jquery file is being applied on page?
[14:01:36] <Snerf> i want to show the "active" tab / page.. seemed only right to assume that ui-state-active is what that means.. as that is different from focus
[14:02:13] <Snerf> anyways.. I will just make a different class and copy ui-state-active
[14:03:20] <duch_kazatel> bansar do what now?
[14:05:43] <duch_kazatel> i hate when i overhear coworkers talking about SOLR sharding.
[14:06:22] <decx> i tried to read the solr config file of my serverguy and had a seizure
[14:06:37] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:07:02] <duch_kazatel> "sharding" starts sounding like "sharting" after a while to my ears.  also: our SOLR guy is awesome.
[14:07:53] <bansar> duch_kazatel: sorry, not able to say more clear. again I would say same. anyway thank you for listen me
[14:08:11] <duch_kazatel> "which method from which jquery file is being applied on page?" that's the confusing part.
[14:08:23] <duch_kazatel> you want to know jquery is being run?
[14:08:29] <duch_kazatel> *what parts of jquery, rather?
[14:12:15] <thebope> drinking at work on Fridays makes work both better
[14:12:22] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[14:12:26] <duch_kazatel> almost keg time for us.
[14:12:28] <thebope> haha
[14:12:32] <thebope> Oh yea you're west coast right?
[14:12:35] <duch_kazatel> yep
[14:13:16] <thebope> yea I was awfully confused when you said lunch time at 3:30 my time earlier for a second
[14:13:23] <duch_kazatel> hah
[14:13:29] <duch_kazatel> i actually have taken lunch that late before.
[14:13:35] <thebope> yea there are rare days
[14:14:29] <duch_kazatel> when i was a project manager i'd wind up eating around 2:00 or 2:30 most days.
[14:15:00] <thebope> yea, I'm not sure management is where I want to end
[14:15:04] <thebope> So I think I might become a comedian
[14:15:07] <thebope> thats the goal ;-)
[14:15:21] <thebope> Which, is kind of a joke in itself!
[14:15:37] <thebope> I hate meetings though
[14:15:45] <thebope> so, like, really, I'd be allergic to being a manager
[14:15:59] <duch_kazatel> our managers are actually really awesome at not doing that.
[14:16:08] <thebope> We don't have *too* many
[14:16:17] <thebope> but the company wide ones are getting to be really long
[14:16:37] <thebope> and then the stand ups three times a week, and if you're scrum master you're always writing status emails haha
[14:16:40] <duch_kazatel> whenever we have a big one, our execs spring for food and booze.
[14:16:41] <thebope> I dunno, I get tired of that
[14:16:50] <thebope> Thats nice, yea we do them when we have company lunch and booze
[14:18:21] <thebope> oh jquery I love you but sometimes you can be a pain in the butt
[14:20:00] <tw2113> i think that's javascript in general
[14:20:39] <thebope> thats true
[14:22:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd say the DOM really.
[14:22:37] <hocza> is there a way to make a progress bar for $.get ? (i'm loading a bit big data into a table via ajax)

[14:23:48] <duch_kazatel> hocza not easily ;)
[14:24:17] <decx> wow a progress event cool
[14:25:08] <hocza> hm... just because now there is a sign: "Loading... (it may take a while)" and the users do not see that if it is actually loading... :)
[14:25:23] <hocza> And it takes ~7-10 seconds to load the data :)
[14:25:24] <duch_kazatel> hocza hrm?
[14:25:40] <duch_kazatel> hocza you probably want a notification on beforesend and then to remove it in .done()
[14:57:08] <thebope> Good nigth everyone
[14:57:14] <thebope> may all your weekends be merry
[15:15:43] <nhulea> happy friday
[15:16:35] <decx> happy friday?
[15:19:32] <countdemo> hello
[15:19:55] <countdemo> new to jquery. have trouble figuring out how to wrap getJson all into my own object. i need data to be returned to this.myData
[15:20:20] <countdemo> $.getJSON(apiCall, function(data){
[15:20:25] <countdemo> this.data = data
[15:20:27] <countdemo> doesnt work
[15:22:32] <countdemo> anyone
[15:25:14] <countdemo> how would i search for this on google
[15:27:19] <decx> this inside the json function isnt the this from outside it
[15:29:28] <countdemo> yes. im trying to get it into the json
[15:29:38] <countdemo> im wrapping the json function in my own object
[15:32:08] <antlong_> what should i use to make a graph that updates every second with a value i get from localStorage?
[15:33:22] <countdemo> what kind of graph. so many libraries out there
[15:33:48] <antlong_> a line graph
[15:38:06] <countdemo> anyone here alive or at work or what?
[15:42:14] <nhulea> does this seem slow to anyone ? http://jsfiddle.net/nhulea/XamDQ/6/
[15:42:16] <nhulea> thanks
[15:45:27] <countdemo> need help understanding scope when i try to wrap getJson in my object
[15:45:38] <countdemo> how can i capture data and return it to my object
[15:46:56] <nhulea> countdemo: an array
[15:47:22] <nhulea> create an array with your object and add in the other stuff you want
[15:47:59] <nhulea> also I am alive and working at work working
[15:49:05] <countdemo> what like this a = new array(); a[myobj] = this; and pass that into getJson(a); ?
[15:50:25] <nhulea> what are you returning ? are you asking for the json from ajax or do you have in your file ?
[15:50:45] <countdemo> thanks for your attention. its a simple problem
[15:50:57] <countdemo> i have an object function MyObj() {} etc
[15:51:09] <countdemo> inside there i have this.getJsonFeed ()
[15:51:26] <countdemo> inside that i have the $.getJSON function
[15:51:45] <countdemo> i want the resulting data gotten by $.getJSON to be stored in my MYObj
[15:52:03] <countdemo> it looses scope whe i try to access myobj (as this) within $.getJSON
[15:54:40] <countdemo> does that make sesnes
[15:56:08] <countdemo> only way i can make it work is real ugly
[15:56:16] <countdemo> MyObj.prototype.me = this;
[15:56:23] <countdemo> that is then seen by jquery function
[15:59:19] <countdemo> can someone elaborate ont his passing in array idea
[16:04:40] <nhulea> var arr = []; arr.push({obj:MYObj}); there you storage of all objects in an array
[16:04:52] <nhulea> var arr = []; arr.push({obj:MYObj}); there you go, storage of all objects in an array
[16:04:59] <nhulea> make sense?
[16:05:22] <nhulea> countdemo: ^
[16:05:28] <countdemo> yes but then i pass that into getJSON?
[16:05:44] <nhulea> to use it ?
[16:05:51] <countdemo> yeah how does getJSON know about it?
[16:06:04] <nhulea> you dont have to use get that
[16:06:18] <nhulea> just console.log(arr);
[16:06:36] <nhulea> you will see it has a list of object that you can iterate through
[16:06:38] <nhulea> so
[16:06:54] <countdemo> ok can you write out how it intervaces with getJSON
[16:06:59] <countdemo> data is now arr?
[16:07:00] <countdemo> ??
[16:07:13] <nhulea> can you show me your coed ?
[16:07:27] <nhulea> sounds like your returning json froma url
[16:07:37] <nhulea> so
[16:08:50] <countdemo> yes exactly
[16:10:05] <nhulea> try this in your success function http://jsfiddle.net/RCxy6/
[16:10:16] <nhulea> but dont do what I did
[16:10:40] <countdemo> haha
[16:10:46] <countdemo> can we bot edit that fiddle now?
[16:11:03] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/RCxy6/1/
[16:11:07] <nhulea> do that
[16:11:25] <nhulea> then look a the console and replace key with your json key value
[16:11:40] <countdemo> ok thanks
[16:11:41] <nhulea> or rather just the key
[16:11:44] <countdemo> never seen a for loop liek that
[16:11:54] <nhulea> so if your json pair is
[16:11:59] <decx> but it's async
[16:12:04] <nhulea> {dude:man}
[16:12:09] <countdemo> yeah its async
[16:12:09] <nhulea> then it would be like
[16:12:29] <nhulea> var cool = data[i].dude
[16:12:36] <nhulea> it would return man
[16:12:40] <nhulea> you get me ?
[16:12:41] <countdemo> right ok
[16:12:48] <nhulea> cool
[16:12:49] <countdemo> sort of.. at least i have a new direciton
[16:13:03] <countdemo> see ?  a man of the people right here
[16:13:21] <countdemo> so then i have to do a callback to trigger my ui to update..what a mess
[16:13:40] <countdemo> angular certainly beats jquery in this area
[16:13:49] <countdemo> though what do i know...week 2 on jquery
[16:16:05] <decx> a for loop to go through an object isnt exactly a jquery specific thing :>
[16:16:08] <nhulea> yeah I think you need something like this probably http://jsfiddle.net/yvzSL/ does thsis help ?
[16:17:24] <countdemo> almost..i need the end to be myObj.parseResults(result)
[16:18:23] <nhulea> can you do this one sec
[16:21:31] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/RCxy6/2/
[16:22:01] <countdemo> OK
[16:22:05] <countdemo> maybe im using the wrong call
[16:22:07] <nhulea> migh work not sure
[16:22:11] <countdemo> im doing getJSON
[16:22:34] <countdemo> ok thanks. i got it working with my ugly prototype way fo rnow
[16:22:36] <nhulea> pluse that success fucntion is part of an ajax call you know that right ?
[16:22:59] <countdemo> no.. i got a jquery book i need to read ahead..just wnated to hack an idea together for now
[16:23:21] <nhulea> yeah I mean if you show your code I can fix it
[16:23:29] <nhulea> either way
[16:23:39] <countdemo> your reward is a sunset view from space
[16:23:43] <countdemo> http://www.helloearth.us/

[18:59:28] <Katharsis> is it possible to send ajax request (post) on url + 8050 port?
[20:01:23] <tables> i'm looking for an image uploader that will open the dialog and send as soon as i open the file

[20:17:23] <elisa87> hey , what does this line do ? $('#exp_instruct').html('');
[20:27:50] <tw2113> find the dom element that has that ID and empties out its inner html
[20:35:21] <elisa87> why should we want to empty out the inner html of an element tw2113
[20:35:21] <elisa87> ?
[20:35:57] <tw2113> depends on the use case
[20:36:22] <tw2113> say it's a dynamically displayed message
[20:36:37] <tw2113> and suddenly there's no more errors, you may want to clear out any lingering error messages
[21:36:41] <il_> join #javascript
