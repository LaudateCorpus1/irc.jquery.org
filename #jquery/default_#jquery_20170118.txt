[03:27:44] <uskerine> Hi, can someone help me to do something when checkbox is pressed?
[03:27:45] <uskerine> https://jsfiddle.net/s37aqxuo/
[03:27:48] <uskerine> I am using bootstrap
[03:30:39] <Uhkis> uskerine: 1) you dont have jquery on that fiddle 2) use .on() instead of those shortcuts if possible 3) use change event instead of click
[03:31:30] <Cork> click and change both work the same on checkboxes/radio buttons
[03:32:00] <Cork> and 4) don't use alert for debugging
[03:32:57] <uskerine> thanks
[03:33:06] <Cork> use console.log instead
[03:33:39] <Cork> alert is a special snowflake in browsers and it means code doesn't run in the order it looks like (so it is BAD for debugging)
[03:34:23] <uskerine> duly noted
[03:41:20] <uskerine> and within the .change event, how do I check if checkbox is checked or not?
[03:41:30] <uskerine> if $('#{{trigger_item}}:checked').length > 0 {
[03:41:40] <Cork> uskerine: this.checked
[03:42:04] <uskerine> if this.checked {
[03:42:05] <uskerine> ?
[03:42:19] <Cork> if requires (), but yes
[03:45:45] <uskerine> my javascript / jqueyr is quite rusty, two years since last time I used it
[03:46:18] <uskerine> is there something opposite to slideDown?
[03:46:23] <uskerine> -to use instead of .hide-
[03:46:49] <uskerine> slideUp...
[04:29:19] <nirakara> if i call a jquery function on some element of the DOM that doesn't exist in the current page, will the function execute and use up RAM
[04:29:45] <nirakara> i want to bundle my js into one file but am concerned that doing so would cause functions to be called that should not be called on the current page
[04:39:14] <Aljone> hey guys i got some issue, im using html5 to show a video using like domain.com/video?id=1 , in the html 5 it shows up so slow and with download abuility. in additional i cant really move back and forward when its loads . ideas?
[04:44:24] <nirakara> Aljone, use a JS player instead of the standard html5 player. for more complicated setups you might need to set up a streaming server
[04:45:15] <Aljone> right now im using nodejs server side and when user gets into /video?id=1 for example it servs the file
[04:45:54] <Aljone> using createReadStream
[05:22:09] <interop_madness> i'm having an event handler being raised twice. it is registered with $(selector).off("event").on("event", handler). $(selector).length is 1. the code registering the handler is called exactly once (i verified). the event is raised at exactly one position, only once (i verified). placing a breakpoint inside the handler results in two hits. placing the breakpoint anywhere else, one hit. ideas?
[05:22:38] <interop_madness> problem reproducible among browsers, thus browser bug ruled out.
[05:23:35] <sadtaco> Eehh.. I can't get this cropit thing to work https://jsfiddle.net/yp3bsyk5/2/   Using an example straight from their github https://github.com/scottcheng/cropit/blob/master/demo/image-background.html
[05:23:47] <sadtaco> "s.default is undefined"
[05:24:00] <sadtaco> I can't find something that works as well in the demo but.. actually works when I try to implement it, too
[05:25:41] <interop_madness> $._data($(selector)[0], "events")[eventName] has length 1. thus, exactly one handler is registered
[05:25:53] <sadtaco> oh wait maybe it does work yet throws an error still
[05:26:09] <interop_madness> i don't now where to go from here. any help welcome.
[05:29:16] <Cork> interop_madness: i would recommend using delegated event handlers and not reregister it over and over again
[05:29:27] <Cork> it would solve the problem and create cleaner code
[05:29:36] <interop_madness> Cork, i have verified that the event handler is registered exactly once.
[05:29:50] <interop_madness> with $(selector).off(event).on(event, handler).
[05:30:00] <Cork> interop_madness: ya, but the selector might match multiple elements for example (parents)
[05:30:01] <interop_madness> thus, handler cardinality is proven to be 1.
[05:30:14] <interop_madness> Cork, i have verified that $(selector).length === 1.#
[05:30:23] <Cork> but .off().on() normally means you are doing something wrong
[05:30:41] <interop_madness> i only added this as a precaution
[05:30:50] <interop_madness> the code registering the event is known to run only once.
[05:31:09] <Cork> interop_madness: can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle.net?
[05:31:24] <interop_madness> Cork, no because i cannot isolate the code properly
[05:31:40] <interop_madness> Cork, but i know the following facts (100% sure, no doubt):
[05:31:50] <interop_madness> 1.) $.trigger(event) is called exactly once
[05:32:00] <interop_madness> 2.) the event handler is registered exactly once
[05:32:09] <Cork> sadtaco: the fiddle works fine here
[05:32:19] <interop_madness> 3.) the selector matches exactly one element
[05:32:23] <sadtaco> it does despite an error there yeaah
[05:32:29] <sadtaco> Drag and dropping in should work too though hm
[05:32:35] <interop_madness> 4.) $._data($(selector)[0], "events")[eventName] has exactly one element.
[05:33:35] <Cork> sadtaco: https://jsfiddle.net/yp3bsyk5/4/
[05:33:36] <interop_madness> in other words, i am pretty sure i did everything to ensure that the event handler should run only once. i'm curious what other reasons there are that the handler could be called multiple times
[05:33:40] <Cork> it is something with the min version
[05:34:00] <sadtaco> Odd..
[05:34:30] <sadtaco> Yeah when I don't use the min the drag works fine too
[05:34:46] <Cork> i suspect a missed ; or something like that
[05:35:01] <Cork> check if it happens if you minify it yourself
[05:35:04] <interop_madness> i placed a breakpoint on $(selector).trigger(event). only one hit. i placed a breakpoint on the code registering the event. only one hit. i made sure that at no other location in the code either the handler is registered or the event is raised.
[05:35:04] <Cork> and if it does, file a bug
[05:48:27] <sadtaco> ty for that find, Cork. I don't think I'd have tried that. :\
[05:54:12] <sadtaco> Is there a way to determine whether png or jpeg would be a lower file size?  I guess I call the .cropit('export') function twice and can compare them somehow.
[05:54:54] <sadtaco> the result of that is an image string like "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...etc".  I'm not sure how I can actually compare file size by that, though
[05:56:17] <Cork> ya
[05:56:22] <Cork> there isn't really an option
[05:56:45] <Cork> also if the source is generated graphics it is normally smaller as png
[05:56:49] <Cork> the rest is jpeg
[05:57:11] <Cork> as what makes png small is large areas of repeated pixels
[05:57:13] <sadtaco> Well I know that much but there's no way for the computer to tell
[05:57:39] <Cork> well no not that is more efficient then just generating the data
[05:58:23] <sadtaco> simplest would be to export as both png and jpg and see which is smallest but I don't know how to really see that because an image string length/size I don't think is indicative as the actual size is it? maybe it is
[05:58:40] <Cork> it is
[05:58:51] <sadtaco> Oh. So I can just compare string lengths
[05:59:18] <sadtaco> and just send the shorter one to my server
[06:00:51] <sadtaco> Would there a way on the server to make sure the image size isn't too small and that the cropping wasn't circumvented on the client? Without actually executing the image on the server because security blah blah.
[06:12:03] <uskerine> any recommendation for form validation library/plugin?
[06:12:38] <Cork> jquery.formvalidator is quite commonly used
[06:13:09] <Cork> sadtaco: you don't execute images
[06:13:38] <sadtaco> Hm. Don't you? Aren't there a ton of security issues involving running images on a server that could be malicious and not really an image?
[06:13:39] <Cork> sadtaco: but yes, parsers can have buffer overflow resulting in image data ending up in execution memory areas
[06:14:38] <sadtaco> right so..
[06:15:16] <Cork> there are ways to handle that (running the image validation in a child process with no permissions for the file system)
[06:15:33] <Cork> but if you're on a shared machine you normally don't have that option
[06:15:35] <sadtaco> Hm.. okay.
[06:15:52] <sadtaco> I'm on Amazon AWS/EC2. So I should be able to do that.
[06:16:30] <OnceMe> what is a good way to use progressbar.js with my ajax?
[06:16:46] <OnceMe> progressbar have duration predefined and there is no way I could know how long will take for something to build
[06:19:27] <Cork> OnceMe: and this why you often have an unknown state for progressbars where it's just a throbber
[06:39:15] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/DteTC5O.png  - $('#pasteit').html('géén'); why its printing invalid?
[07:13:41] <hg55> Has anyone here ever used DataTables with column resizing?
[07:27:36] <e-anima> hi
[07:28:07] <e-anima> how would you clone the content of a clicked DIV that has display:none. apparently clone doesnt work if display:noen is set.
[07:37:10] <AdamPDotty> e-anima: What did you try?
[07:37:27] <e-anima> var content = $(this).find('.popup-text').clone();
[07:37:50] <e-anima> that works if the .popup-text does not have display:none
[07:38:10] <e-anima> problem is i dont want to show the popup text by default.
[07:38:23] <e-anima> i only want to show it in the popup :)
[07:39:09] <AdamPDotty> Works for me, maybe create a fiddle with that problem.
[07:55:28] <samsamek> when iterating over each <input> and executing a function, how can I access the elements name within the function? Like so:
[07:56:02] <samsamek> find('select’).each( function () {  // here I want to access the name attribute of the current <select> }
[07:56:27] <FilipNortic_> $(this).attr("name");
[07:56:34] <samsamek> awesome
[07:56:45] <samsamek> so no need to pass a parameter
[08:02:03] <sadtaco> What is the unicode for &#xf03e;?
[08:02:49] <sadtaco> escaped that is
[08:03:13] <sadtaco> http://scottcheng.github.io/cropit/  Like I need the same as that image icon on here
[08:03:22] <sadtaco> Which I know is &#xf03e;
[08:08:26] <AdamPDotty> samsamek: also try this.name
[08:08:56] <samsamek> .name is a jquery method that gets the “name” attr value?
[08:09:10] <AdamPDotty> nothing to do with jquery
[08:09:13] <samsamek> oh
[08:09:16] <AdamPDotty> just javascript
[08:33:25] <samsamek> how do you check if an array holds any values?
[08:33:37] <samsamek> array.length == 0?
[08:38:51] <dglambert> morning
[08:40:48] <sadtaco> Oh no. :|  The image uploading and cropping thing doesn't look nearly as good as the previous.  The downscaling is very choppy.  It looks how things look when you're dragging an image around in the browser, not when it's settled and has smoothed out.
[08:41:33] <sadtaco> https://jsfiddle.net/yp3bsyk5/6/ see for yourself. I'm not sure what I do about that.
[08:41:58] <sadtaco> http://scottcheng.github.io/cropit/ I don't see any option here about the sampling...
[08:53:25] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/gamealchemist/r6aVp/ I found this but ... doesn't help me much here
[08:55:21] <Hollusionist> is there an already implemented method to set values within a form using data from serializeArray() ?+
[08:56:58] <sadtaco> oh it has pica support I think. lets see
[09:04:58] <sadtaco> https://github.com/scottcheng/cropit/blob/master/demo/pica.html hm.. not totally sure what to make of this, or how to get the base64 string.
[09:06:29] <sadtaco> I guess just zoomedCanvas.toBlob()
[09:07:37] <sadtaco> but then how do I png or jpg..
[09:08:06] <sadtaco> oh nvm
[09:12:10] <hackal> Any reason https://gist.github.com/hackal/a49814dfd49e4491c854ab059fff39a8 when I click on the link and want to scroll down the page jumps up and then scrolls down? I thought e.preventDefault() should fix this.
[09:23:02] <FilipNortic_> hackal: e.preventDefault() just prevents the browser form trying to get to the href in the <a> tag
[09:23:46] <FilipNortic_> or whatever the default action would be for the link or button you click
[09:24:55] <hackal> yes, but in this case it means that it prevents browser from going to # where usually # scrolls you to the top. In this case it should be prevented but thing I have at the moment jumps up and then scrolls down. Do you think there can be anything that could interfere with the .on('click'...) from before?
[09:26:28] <FilipNortic_> you're sure that it's not the focus that does this?
[09:27:18] <ctmarco> https://jsfiddle.net/d43gj7fk/ Whats is wrong with this code?
[09:29:05] <FilipNortic_> ctmarco: well jQuery arent loaded otherwise I don't know?
[09:29:29] <ctmarco> why not loaded?
[09:29:31] <codecutter> why is it -1 on line 4 when accountId 1 and array has [1,2]?
[09:29:33] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/MH46mBYz
[09:29:52] <ctmarco> FilipNortic_: WHy not loaded?
[09:30:10] <FilipNortic_> cause you didn't add it to the fiddle
[09:30:20] <hackal> FilipNortic_: you are correct, however when testing only focus() it didn't jump to the top but when having animate and focus it did. I changed the code so that the focus is called when animate is done: https://gist.github.com/hackal/a49814dfd49e4491c854ab059fff39a8
[09:30:32] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:32:57] <FilipNortic_> hackal: it really seems what your code does is scroll to the top in 600 ms and then focus an element, what's the problem?
[09:33:42] <sadtaco> woo okay that pica lib worked to downsample nicer
[09:34:54] <codecutter> strange, right?
[09:35:18] <FilipNortic_> codecutter: can't see anything obvious, make a fiddle if you want someone to have a closer look
[09:40:41] <AdamPDotty> "equal to 1" does not necessarily mean "1"
[09:53:08] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees: I don't think i told you thanks yesterday, but thanks
[10:23:03] <tomc9> hey guys could anyone check this jsfiddle for me please https://jsfiddle.net/v25r25oe/ the javascript is part of a bigger form submit, I can't seem to manage to target the .hidden-elements (last line of JS) could anyone say where I am going wrong?
[10:25:00] <AdamPDotty> well, if you did not care to look ...
[10:33:26] <FilipNortic_> tomc9: you do some wierd stuff in there...
[10:34:47] <FilipNortic_> the .html() method will erase everthing all children of the elments its called on and replace it with what you specify in there
[10:35:18] <tomc9> lol sorry its part of a bigger bit of code I just wanted to target the next div, yea replacing with html was just a test to see if I had targeted it correctly
[10:36:34] <FilipNortic_> tomc9: unless you do alot of dynamic appends test log the selector string and run it maually in the console
[10:40:41] <uskerine> hi
[10:40:52] <uskerine> can someone help me to understand why bootstrap validator is not working here? https://jsfiddle.net/w9L3kebg/1/
[10:44:25] <titii> Hi guys, i would have a question a bower, when I instal the jquery into bower_components, how to use these sources in a project with linking sources? Like <script src="bower_components\jquery\dist/jquery.js"> is ok?
[10:44:55] <titii> I dont how using the sources from bower
[10:45:04] <ctmarco> {"response":{"data":["Egypt","North Korea","Philippines","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Colombia","Cyprus","Finland","Spain"]}}
[10:45:17] <ctmarco> How to loop throug every country with eachh?
[10:53:36] <MikeD_> ctmarco: what have you tried?
[11:48:17] <ctmarco> "data":["Egypt","North Korea","Philippines","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Colombia","Cyprus","Finland","Spain"]
[11:48:32] <ctmarco> How to iterate through this with $.each() function?
[11:49:25] <robertmaxrees> $.each(object.data, function(index, value) { console.log(value) });
[11:49:32] <robertmaxrees> though I'd suggest using the native forEach instea.d
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> ctmarco
[11:53:55] <decx> depends what you're doing with it
[11:54:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:54:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, fair point.
[11:54:23] <robertmaxrees> like you might need to map it, join it, reduce it, etc.
[11:54:26] <decx> each or a forEach is probably the wrong approach here as i don't think it should be mutated
[11:54:42] <robertmaxrees> using those doesn't imply you're going to mutate the arrayu.
[11:54:51] <decx> probably soemthing for map(function(){ return html }).join()
[11:54:52] <robertmaxrees> nor should you with those imo.
[11:55:04] <decx> without any background info ^^
[11:55:06] <robertmaxrees> ah, looks like I'm missing context :)
[11:55:09] <decx> same
[12:57:27] <aiena> I was experimenting with jquery trying to extract data from this site. http://www.herroom.com/hosiery.aspx
[12:57:59] <aiena> I found a table with a class "serp" SO I did $(".serp").find("td[class=borderz]")
[12:58:20] <aiena> It seems to find the td but now I cannot decend into those to say extract the URL of the href inside it
[12:59:22] <taplar> what do you mean you 'cannot' ?
[13:03:05] <aiena> I cannot Like for example do $(".serp").find("td[class=borderz]")[0].find("a")
[13:03:22] <taplar> right, cause [0] breaks out of the jquery object
[13:03:23] <aiena> or even assigning th first found td to a variable I cannot search within it
[13:03:45] <taplar> you can use eq(0) or first() to keep it as a jquery variable
[13:04:22] <aiena> taplar:  so suppose I want to loop through all tds anfd get the href of the anchors inside them
[13:04:31] <taplar> sure
[13:04:56] <aiena> $(".serp").find("td[class=borderz]").each.find("a").attr("href") ?
[13:05:00] <aiena> will that work
[13:05:03] <taplar> no
[13:05:10] <taplar> have you looked at the documentation for each() ?
[13:06:07] <aiena> hmm sorry
[13:06:13] <robertmaxrees> go check it out :0
[13:06:14] <aiena> it is actually something else
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[13:06:25] <aiena> forgive my ignorance
[13:06:28] <taplar> hmm?
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.  the docs are pretty solid.
[13:07:49] <taplar> and fwiw, consider in the future when stating a problem, if you actually 'cannot' do it, or just don't know how, ;)
[13:08:12] <aiena> ok I dont know how
[13:08:27] <aiena> I couldnt because I thought you could use the index like [0]
[13:08:35] <taplar> which is perfectly valid
[13:08:36] <aiena> but now its different
[13:08:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:08:43] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ <-- give that a gander
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:08:55] <taplar> or his, i may have the non jquery object one
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.each is for non-jquery objects.
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:09:16] <taplar> that's what i get for trying to type the url from memory
[13:09:20] <robertmaxrees> haha
[13:09:26] <robertmaxrees> still pretty impressive.
[13:09:36] <aiena> taplar:  How do I loop through each td and extract the href attr in its children ?
[13:09:47] <robertmaxrees> using .each() :)
[13:09:53] <robertmaxrees> you pass it a function.
[13:10:31] <aiena> ok not very clear on the syntax of the each()
[13:10:57] <robertmaxrees> $('td').each(function() { $(this) });
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the current TD
[13:11:26] <aiena> ok
[13:11:31] <aiena> and wahat is element then ?
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:47] <aiena> *what is index,element then ?
[13:11:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't need those.
[13:11:59] <robertmaxrees> " More importantly, the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword this refers to the element."
[13:12:02] <aiena> as in  $( "div" ).each(function( index, element ) {
[13:12:04] <robertmaxrees> so you just use $(this)
[13:12:33] <aiena> ok
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> the docs even show you that :)
[13:12:54] <taplar> each iterates over the elements contained inside the $(), so if you used those parameters, the index is the current index of the element in the results, and the element is the element
[13:13:27] <taplar> it's generically 'element' cause it couldn't be many things
[13:13:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:13:40] <taplar> *could
[13:17:42] <aiena> ok
[13:17:50] <aiena> taplar:  I tried this var a = $(".serp").find("td[class=borderz]")
[13:18:04] <aiena> so now a contains 48 td's from the table
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> why not just .find('.border2')?
[13:18:41] <aiena> now running $(a).each(function() { $(this).html() });
[13:18:47] <aiena> I do not get inner html of each td
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:18:51] <aiena> err html
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this).html() doesn't do anything.
[13:19:15] <taplar> first you can do use 'a' since it is already a jquery object
[13:19:22] <taplar> ^
[13:19:33] <taplar> it gets it, but does nothing with it
[13:20:28] <aiena> taplar:  Why does $(a).each(function() { console.log("Hi") }); not log "Hi" 48 times
[13:20:35] <aiena> if there are 48 td's
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[13:20:44] <aiena> but it doesnt
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> are you getting errors in your console?
[13:20:56] <taplar> your browser may show it once, but have a number off to the side in a bubble
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> also, do those links have other classes other than just border2?
[13:22:35] <aiena> hmm copying and pasting form the firefox console does not preserve newlines
[13:23:06] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're not answering my question about classes?
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> >.> lol
[13:24:19] <aiena> actally inside the td there are 3 nested divs insiide it
[13:24:30] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what I'm asking heh
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> "td[class=borderz]" will only select TDs whose class attribute exactly matches borderz
[13:24:57] <aiena> nods
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> try just '.borderz' instead
[13:25:14] <aiena> how
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> even if you don't have other classes, attribute selectors are slow.
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> literally replace td[class=borderz] with just .borderz
[13:26:14] <aiena> yes that works too
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> which is preferred :)
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mf5xqwqn/
[13:26:36] <aiena> ok
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> like, this is the basic gist of what you want to do.
[13:27:10] <taplar> my assumption though is you're not going to be going after the html though
[13:27:20] * aiena is looking waiting for the fiddle to load
[13:27:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ taplar is right.
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> what're you actually trying to accomplish?
[13:28:10] <aiena> taplar: yes I primarily want to traverse the DOM to extract useful snippets from it.
[13:28:22] <aiena> Eventually I want to use cheerio to scrape the site as an exercise
[13:28:23] <robertmaxrees> and do what with them?
[13:28:27] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:28:33] <aiena> but cherrio uses jquery like syntax
[13:28:49] <aiena> and it actually is fun practicing with jquery like this traversing the dom
[13:28:57] <taplar> i dunno about that, but in this case you said you wanted the href of the contained a's
[13:29:02] <aiena> WIll help me improve my dismal JS skills
[13:29:09] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[13:29:11] <robertmaxrees> and try.jquery.com
[13:29:26] <aiena> taplar: yes
[13:29:37] <aiena> taplar: except there are like 48 a's in 48 tds
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy to do.
[13:29:48] <taplar> one in each, ya?
[13:29:59] <aiena> yes
[13:30:04] <taplar> how can you find them?
[13:30:10] <aiena> I dont think it matters that they are nested 3 divs isnide each td
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:30:38] <aiena> so hence I need to loop through each td and then get the a and whatever other info I want from it
[13:30:49] <taplar> so you got the loop part
[13:30:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, trivial.
[13:31:03] <aiena> taplar: but the loop doesnt exho "hi: 48 times
[13:31:10] <aiena> so there is still something wrong
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> does it print it once?
[13:31:18] <aiena> yes
[13:31:19] <taplar> console.log(Date.now); instead
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> if so, look to right right.
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> there a number?
[13:31:23] <taplar> err
[13:31:26] <taplar> console.log(Date.now()); instead
[13:32:12] <aiena> hmm that worked
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:32:24] <aiena> so the console was compressing the output
[13:32:27] <aiena> or something
[13:32:29] <robertmaxrees> if you go back to the other one and look to the right, you'll see a number.
[13:32:40] <taplar> as i mentioned before, and robert was just pointing out, your browser will collapse the same outputs and bubble a number next to it
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:33:05] <taplar> it's easier for developers to see this instead of having to scroll through perhaps pages of output
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:33:17] <aiena> taplar: ok but firefox console shouwed one but never showed mt a bubble with number of repeats
[13:33:24] <robertmaxrees> it probably did.
[13:33:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:33:30] <robertmaxrees> you may have just missed it.
[13:33:38] <aiena> robertmaxrees: I checked again
[13:33:44] <robertmaxrees> it's always worked for me.
[13:33:56] <aiena> wanna aprint screen
[13:34:05] <aiena> are you using frebug or the native console ?
[13:34:09] <aiena> firebug
[13:34:09] <robertmaxrees> native.
[13:34:10] <robertmaxrees> always native
[13:34:12] <robertmaxrees> never firebug.
[13:34:13] <aiena> I am using native too
[13:34:30] <aiena> aarg the bubble was on the left
[13:34:38] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:34:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:34:40] <aiena> silly me pardonnez moi Monsiuers
[13:35:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:37:20] <aiena> ok cool works thank you amigos
[13:37:36] <aiena> $(a).each(function() {console.log($(this).find("a").attr("href")); }); got the href's
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:04:29] <jacob144> Hey I want to write some html to a file with jquery, but it has divs and classes in it, how do I do this?
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery can't access the filesystem.
[14:06:05] <jacob144> Okay, then can i use removeClass and addClass to hide the html?
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:06:15] <jacob144> Okay
[14:06:25] <robertmaxrees> you just can use JS to save any of that to a file :)
[14:07:11] <robertmaxrees> *can't
[14:07:16] <jacob144> What do you mean by that? Save classes to the file?
[14:07:18] <jacob144> Oh
[14:07:36] <robertmaxrees> like, in-browser JS can't interact with the filesystem like that.
[14:08:21] <jacob144> So I can't put HTML into a file with Jquery, I can just modify selectors? That is what you are saying?
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> you can change things in the DOM.
[14:08:47] <robertmaxrees> that's all js is able to do.
[14:09:46] <jacob144> Oh,
[14:09:53] <jacob144> Didn't know that
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, js can't edit files on servers.
[14:10:14] <robertmaxrees> in-browser is all it can do.
[14:10:30] <jacob144> I guess that is kinda obvious though
[14:10:40] <jacob144> if I think it through more
[14:10:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:10:53] <robertmaxrees> kind of a security thing heh
[14:10:57] <jacob144> Ps I'm new to code :)
[14:11:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[14:26:02] <taplar> you could make js prompt the user for a file download though.  i don't remember the specifics of it
[14:33:24] <bad_ip> Can anyone tell me why my iteration over the table classes is breaking on the second iteration?
[14:33:25] <bad_ip> http://pastebin.com/09MHnTfw
[14:34:22] <taplar> var $table = $('#'+this.id)  huh?
[14:34:24] <robertmaxrees> getting an error.
[14:34:28] <bad_ip> :D
[14:34:31] <robertmaxrees> "colWidth is undefined:
[14:34:38] <bad_ip> hmm
[14:34:51] <robertmaxrees> $(v).width(colWidth[i]);
[14:34:57] <robertmaxrees> you define it with no value and then try to use it.
[14:38:42] <bad_ip> Honestly I stole this off Stack Exchange
[14:38:47] <bad_ip> This kind of stuff is beyond me
[14:38:55] <robertmaxrees> great opportunity to learn then :)
[14:39:26] <bad_ip> `The code doesn't really make sense though because there's no variables in function()
[14:39:30] <bad_ip> err args
[14:39:41] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[14:39:56] <robertmaxrees> the callback for .each() ?
[14:39:57] <bad_ip> colWidth
[14:40:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean the one that tries to define colWidth?
[14:40:33] <robertmaxrees> and it makes sense - you don't need any ares. $(this) is the current element.
[14:40:57] <bad_ip> ah
[14:42:14] <bad_ip> OH
[14:42:16] <bad_ip> hah
[14:42:20] <bad_ip> I had them out of order
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> get it now?
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:42:24] <bad_ip> rookieness
[14:42:42] <bad_ip> call me degrading names plz
[14:42:52] <robertmaxrees> heh we don't do that here ;)
[14:42:57] <bad_ip> You should
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> unless you're a jerk.  and you're not.
[14:43:00] <bad_ip> it's nice
[14:43:05] <jacob144> :) Good thing
[14:44:03] <taplar> var $table = $('#'+this.id) <--
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:44:09] <robertmaxrees> this is REALLY weird.
[14:44:18] <robertmaxrees> could change that to just $(this);
[15:03:53] <fdobrovo> Hi all. I'm strugling with one thing. What is the correct approach for waiting for promise to done? I need to wait for it I can't use callback instead.
[15:04:06] <fdobrovo> Any help? Please
[15:04:09] <taplar> a callback is how you wait
[15:04:46] <taplar> you tell it what to do with a callback and when it is done it will call that callback
[15:05:30] <taplar> though it's not really a wait since it's async
[15:05:59] <fdobrovo> I know but I have a validate function on one library and I need to change the data inside that function
[15:06:13] <fdobrovo> with the data from callback
[15:06:21] <taplar> which would would do in the callback
[15:07:03] <taplar> or you invoke a method from the callback, giving it the data, so it's a bit more extracted
[15:07:27] <taplar> in any case, it will need to originate from a callback
[15:09:00] <fdobrovo> I need to return it in the validate function
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> which validate are you using?
[15:09:45] <fdobrovo> I have a Bootstrap X editable
[15:10:21] <robertmaxrees> so you want to validate via ajax?
[15:10:31] <fdobrovo> kind of
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> https://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/docs.html - search for "For example, you want to validate submitted value on server: "
[15:11:45] <robertmaxrees> explains exactly how to do that :)
[15:12:10] <fdobrovo> Unfortunetly it's not what I need :(
[15:12:19] <robertmaxrees> can you clarify what you're doing then?
[15:16:07] <fdobrovo> Well exactly what I need is to supply some params function to it in which it asks users via eModal confirmation for some specific detail about it (boolean) and than add the boolean into the params so it can be sent with the changed data
[15:16:41] <robertmaxrees> are they submitting a form or something?
[15:16:52] <robertmaxrees> what kicks off that confirmation process.
[15:18:35] <fdobrovo> The X-editable creates a button which "submits" an input after which the "params" function on it should be called with the request data where I can add data and return it
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you don't want x-editable's submit then.
[15:18:56] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[15:21:29] <fdobrovo> Hmm thank you very much robertmaxrees and taplar I think I will have to maka a seprate ajax request for it in callback :) have a nice day :)
[15:25:04] <robertmaxrees> taplar weren't you on vacation recently?
[15:25:22] <taplar> ha haha ha
[15:25:41] <taplar> if by that you mean did i get sick on saturday and it's plagued me to this day.... then yes
[15:25:47] <robertmaxrees> oh shit.
[15:25:52] <taplar> never fails man
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> i thought you went on vacation - sorry to hear that.
[15:26:13] <taplar> yeah, i did friday and monday.
[15:26:21] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[15:27:12] <taplar> took yesterday as a sick day and came back today.  and from the sound of the peeps in the office i'm not the only one feeling bad.
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[15:29:22] <taplar> got this friday and following monday to.  i just have to do that travel i told you about a while ago on saturday and sunday
[15:29:35] <robertmaxrees> oooh.  that's right.
[15:32:57] <lilalinux> On clicking a button I'm trying to set the value of an initialized slider but get the following error: "jquery-1.12.4.js:253 Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on slider prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'value'"
[15:33:06] <lilalinux> hölp
[15:33:11] <robertmaxrees> gotta make sure you init the slider first.
[15:33:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:33:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle or something?
[15:33:55] <lilalinux> http://pastebin.com/7Kepx0Bf\
[15:34:38] <gopal86> hello there. I am a newbie and wanted to contribute . can any1 guide me through ??
[15:34:42] <lilalinux> it's the #curve sliders
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> gopal86 check out contribute.jquery.com
[15:35:14] <robertmaxrees> lilalinux with $("#curve span").slider( "value", i ); ?
[15:35:34] <lilalinux> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:35:41] <gopal86> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:35:44] <damarusama> I want to remove ( and ) and everything in between for a certain class
[15:35:54] <damarusama> what would be the best way ? Regexp?
[15:36:15] <robertmaxrees> damarusama yep.  otherwise you're getting into an awkward set of string splits.
[15:36:30] <damarusama> jquery regexp is the same as js ?
[15:36:34] <damarusama> (noob here)
[15:36:40] <robertmaxrees> there's no jquery regexp
[15:36:42] <robertmaxrees> it's all js.
[15:36:46] <damarusama> cool
[15:37:27] <damarusama> thanks!
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> ah - lilalinux  $("#curve span") is probably matching more than just the elements you want.
[15:38:33] <robertmaxrees> try $("#curve > span")
[15:38:58] <lilalinux> indeed, it's matching twice as much
[15:39:04] <lilalinux> thank you
[15:39:25] <lilalinux> the handle and the bar
[15:40:09] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[15:42:08] <robertmaxrees> this is a good example of part of why you should save selectors in vars.
[15:51:21] <samsamek> how do you place a variable in an object? var myObj = {firstName:Foo, lastName:Bar} ?
[15:51:27] <samsamek> with Foo and Bar being variables
[15:51:35] <robertmaxrees> that's... how you do ti.
[15:51:37] <robertmaxrees> *it
[15:51:39] <samsamek> lol okay
[15:51:47] <samsamek> but what if my key name is the same as the variable name
[15:51:52] <samsamek> {firstName:firstName}
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, too.
[15:52:00] <samsamek> cool
[15:52:10] <samsamek> do I owe you a beer now? or how does this work
[15:52:12] <robertmaxrees> and if you're supporting ES2015, you can just do firstname
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> hahaha we're here for free.
[15:52:23] <samsamek> hehe i know just kidding
[15:52:26] <samsamek> whats ES2015?
[15:52:32] <robertmaxrees> aka es6
[15:52:51] <robertmaxrees> as in, the current JS version - gotta use special stuff to support it in lots of browsers though.
[15:53:40] <samsamek> aah
[17:15:42] <uskerine> hi
[17:16:04] <uskerine> how can I get a JSON object for all the input fields in a form?
[17:16:23] <uskerine> I want to send a JSON object when submitting the form instead of the regular SUBMIT button
[17:23:56] <taplar> you can serialize() the form
[17:24:29] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[17:25:26] <dni-> tapli
[17:25:28] <dni-> :)
[17:25:34] <taplar> sup
[17:28:28] <uskerine> I got an empty string
[17:28:36] <uskerine> is there anything needed in the <input> html elements?
[17:28:47] <uskerine> like the id of the form or something like that?
[17:29:16] <taplar> var theData = $('formSelector').serialize();
[17:29:44] <taplar> it will only serialize properly constructed input fields, aka, those with a name
[17:30:16] <uskerine> I think I only populated id's
[17:30:17] <uskerine> thanks
[17:39:35] <erebel55> does anyone know why this doesn't fade in?
[17:39:37] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/fe9tkyco/6/
[17:42:13] <taplar> i don't see a fade out any where
[17:42:47] <erebel55> yeah I'm hiding immediately and trying to fade in
[17:43:08] <erebel55> oh i see
[17:43:15] <taplar> you're removing the hidden class from that which you are wanting to fade in
[17:43:16] <erebel55> the opacity is always going to be 1
[17:43:39] <dni-> :D taplar, not much
[17:43:56] <dni-> nah, im really trying to find a decision
[17:44:08] <dni-> and its hard^^
[17:44:18] <taplar> oh?
[17:44:34] <dni-> so im drinkin beer and trying to chill out ;)
[17:44:51] <taplar> sounds like you're having more fun than i am
[17:45:01] <dni-> my alarm bell a ringing heavily because the last 3 month where terrible
[17:45:20] <dni-> and my english is off^^
[17:45:35] <dni-> beers.. :)
[17:55:12] <erebel55> closer, but still not correct http://jsfiddle.net/fe9tkyco/19/
[17:55:45] <erebel55> I'm trying to switch between 2 divs with fading
[17:56:02] <erebel55> and have the divs in the same position
[17:56:08] <erebel55> without absolute positioning
[18:01:29] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/fe9tkyco/20/
[18:02:35] <erebel55> beautiful :)
[18:02:38] <erebel55> thank you taplar
[18:02:44] <taplar> np
[18:02:51] <taplar> get what it is doing?
[18:03:26] <erebel55> readying on filter now
[18:03:51] <taplar> filter() works on the previously found elements
[18:04:02] <taplar> it returns those that match the filter
[18:04:31] <erebel55> ahh okay that is really useful
[18:06:18] <erebel55> so it checks to see if it's hidden and if it isn't then it fades it out, hides it
[18:06:37] <taplar> yeah, cause if it isn't hidden, then there's no work to be done
[18:06:49] <erebel55> is the $toggle.css('display', 'none') repetitive?
[18:06:56] <erebel55> ah I guess not since you are removing the hidden class at that point
[18:07:01] <taplar> what do you mean?
[18:07:14] <taplar> no you need that so when you remove that class, the element still has that property on it
[18:07:25] <taplar> since you want the fadeIn to start from the base of display none
[18:07:59] <taplar> a fadeIn of something that isn't hidden is just ignored
[18:08:13] <taplar> afaik
[18:08:15] <erebel55> ahh okay I see
[18:08:32] <erebel55> I haven't used css in js like that, that is interesting
[18:23:12] <erebel55> thanks gaain
[18:23:13] <erebel55> again
[18:23:22] <taplar> sure
[18:25:42] <jacob144> I'm having a code error due to setting a global variable http://pasteboard.co/nJaf9xI7E.png
[18:25:53] <jacob144> Ps I'm new to code
[18:26:44] <taplar> are you sure $this.siblings('audio') matches elements?
[18:27:49] <jacob144> yep http://pasteboard.co/nJdWPL7I2.png
[18:28:23] <taplar> not sure what i'm looking at
[18:28:28] <jacob144> At least I think?
[18:28:39] <jacob144> Oh wait, maybe not...
[18:28:44] <taplar> console.log($this.siblings('audio').length);
[18:30:12] <taplar> yeah, your logic looks incorrect.  you are referring to 'this' inside the top part of a doc ready which will either be undefined, or the document/window, i forget which
[18:30:32] <jacob144> It is saying it is not defined, and it isn't,
[18:30:38] <jacob144> You are right
[18:35:25] <ExeciN> how do I remove this $("#file-upload").on("change", "input", function() { blahblah } ); I tried with $("#file-upload").unbind(); but it doesn't seem to work
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> .off()
[18:35:39] <robertmaxrees> but I'd rethink that strategy imo
[18:35:55] <ExeciN> whats wrong?
[18:36:04] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't juggle event bindings.
[18:36:08] <robertmaxrees> especially delegated ones.
[18:36:46] <taplar> if you make the child filter more granular you can modify the targeted element to no longer match
[18:36:49] <ExeciN> oh its just for debugging. I want to nullify the code the server is pushing to try a modified version of it
[18:37:11] <ExeciN> and if it works I'll push it
[18:43:54] <jacob144> So basically what I'm doing is (I'm using Word Press) putting this code int the footer http://pasteboard.co/nJjgRWKsZ.png and then selecting 'player-center' in this original code, http://pasteboard.co/nJsMT3sV8.png  My problem with it is I need to access the audio outside of this player-center.click function but the audio=this relies on looking for
[18:43:54] <jacob144>  siblings of player-center
[18:45:15] <taplar> what do you mean you need to access it outside?
[18:45:31] <taplar> and how many of these guys are there?
[18:46:08] <jacob144> just a moment..
[18:46:41] <taplar> mainly asking if there is more than one, cause if there is only one the issue is smaller
[18:58:25] * taplar begins to fade away
[18:58:32] <jacob144> taplar: sorry for the wait, I'm sick today, anyway what I'm doing is when a user clicks on the pop up button the pop up player comes up in a new window (I'm working localhost :( ) This has required a cookie, so what I want is that when the cookie is there, Ie the popup is open. I want the player to be removed from the page. thus this code http://pa
[18:58:32] <jacob144> steboard.co/nJJkqgsbY.png right now this adds a class of 'hiddenplayer' which does hide the player not turn it off.
[18:59:11] <taplar> but is there only one of these players?
[18:59:26] <jacob144> One on every page
[18:59:31] <jacob144> Yes/no
[18:59:36] <taplar> lol, per page
[18:59:41] <jacob144> If there is one tab open
[18:59:51] <taplar> what are we calling a tab?
[18:59:56] <taplar> browser tab?
[18:59:57] <jacob144> Browser tab
[19:00:00] <jacob144> yes
[19:00:05] <taplar> that's multiple pages
[19:00:10] <taplar> javascript doesn't cross pages
[19:00:13] <taplar> so per page, just one
[19:00:21] <jacob144> yes
[19:00:30] <taplar> so you don't need a 'this'  you can just target it
[19:00:43] <jacob144> But I'm using cookies in a creative way to effect all the pages
[19:00:45] <jacob144> ?
[19:00:55] <taplar> javascript runs on a page by page basis
[19:01:06] <taplar> for a given page, if there is only one of these guys, you can just target it
[19:01:15] <jacob144> Target the audio element?
[19:01:32] <taplar> $(yourselector).siblings('audio')[0]
[19:01:36] <taplar> what you are doing
[19:01:43] <taplar> or yes, give it an id
[19:01:48] <taplar> you could do that to
[19:02:13] <jacob144> Can I pause/play it through an id?
[19:02:20] <jacob144> id.play
[19:02:39] <taplar> no, the point it to get a reference to it.  right now you are doing that by it's relation to the other guy
[19:02:43] <taplar> an id would just make getting that reference easier
[19:03:15] <taplar> like if you named it id="audioPlayer"
[19:03:27] <jacob144> So instead of geting player-center and looking for a sibling i'd be looking for the element, got yah
[19:03:28] <taplar> $('#audioPlayer')[0].play()
[19:04:55] <taplar> but that's all for me, fixing to head to the house.
[19:05:24] <jacob144> Okay, well that is a start to a solution I think, thanks :)
[19:05:33] <jacob144> It helps alot
[19:05:41] <taplar> sure, hope it does, ^_^
[19:57:19] <uskerine> this does not generate a json object: json_form = $( '#sign-in-form' ).serialize();
[19:57:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:59:02] <uskerine> robertmaxrees can you help me to get a json object that I can properly submit to a webservice
[19:59:37] <robertmaxrees> serializeArray() is probably what you want.
[20:00:19] <uskerine> let me check, thanks
[20:01:56] <uskerine> I would expect to see a JSON object while inspecting the POST request using firebug
[20:01:58] <uskerine> but I do not
[20:02:26] <robertmaxrees> that does return a JSON object.
[20:02:32] <robertmaxrees> perhaps it's not the format you're expecting?
[20:04:44] <uskerine> I am expecting a JSON object, I mean I have to code the webservice, it is just that I do not see the typical JSON object while inspecting the request in firebug
[20:04:54] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating that tgerm.
[20:05:06] <robertmaxrees> JSON allows for objects or arrays.,
[20:05:12] <robertmaxrees> serializeArray() returns an array.
[20:05:19] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting fieldname: value instead?
[20:05:46] <Forbidd3_> Anyone know why the dropdowns are messing up in the modal? http://jsfiddle.net/p8hbgy53/
[20:07:20] <robertmaxrees> how are they "messing up"?
[20:10:49] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3_
[20:11:22] <uskerine> I will try this: var myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" };
[20:11:22] <uskerine> var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
[20:11:27] <Forbidd3_> robertmaxrees: open modal and select month from dropdown and it doesn't allow it
[20:11:31] <Forbidd3_> in FF
[20:11:46] <robertmaxrees> uskerine then you';ll have to build that yourself.
[20:11:53] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3_ that's working fine for me.
[20:12:12] <Forbidd3_> in FF?
[20:12:17] <robertmaxrees> yep
[20:12:18] <Forbidd3_> you can select the month and the year?
[20:12:26] <robertmaxrees> yep
[20:12:34] <Forbidd3_> weird, I can't same exact fiddle
[20:16:04] <Forbidd3_> robertmaxrees: you can actually select the dropdown, new month and it doesn't flicker?
[20:16:14] <robertmaxrees> "flicker"?
[20:16:43] <Forbidd3_> it doesn't allow you to select a month or year. it works in Chrome just not in FF
[20:16:58] <robertmaxrees> it works for me.
[20:17:53] <Forbidd3_> may I ask your FF v.?
[20:18:10] <robertmaxrees> 52.0a2
[20:18:12] <Forbidd3_> I have 50.1.0
[20:18:17] <Forbidd3_> and it says it is up to date
[20:18:24] <Forbidd3_> hmm
[20:18:27] <robertmaxrees> you're on main release channel i'm guessing.
[20:18:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[20:18:53] <uskerine> var myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" };
[20:18:53] <uskerine> var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
[20:18:55] <robertmaxrees> hah.  prior versions it fails.
[20:18:57] <uskerine> <p>Failed to decode JSON object: No JSON object could be decoded</p>
[20:19:05] <robertmaxrees> uskerine share a fiddle.
[20:19:15] <Forbidd3_> robertmaxrees: ok so I'm not alone. ugh
[20:19:17] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need to stringify necessawrily.
[20:19:44] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3_ doesn't bootstrap have a datepicker?
[20:20:06] <Forbidd3_> yeah, but the theme I am using has the datepicker styled already
[20:20:07] <Forbidd3_> no worries
[20:20:12] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:20:17] <robertmaxrees> don't mix jqui and bootstrap.
[20:20:22] <robertmaxrees> that'll save you tons of headaches
[20:20:37] <Forbidd3_> I purchased this admin theme.
[20:20:44] <Forbidd3_> I have to take what it comes with :/
[20:20:50] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't change my advice.
[20:20:52] <robertmaxrees> don't combine them.
[20:20:57] <robertmaxrees> does the tgheme require them both?
[20:21:01] <Forbidd3_> robertmaxrees: I understand
[20:21:01] <uskerine> done! it was: json_form = JSON.stringify( $('#sign-in-form' ).serializeArray());
[20:21:10] <Forbidd3_> it is incorporating both
[20:21:12] <uskerine> 200 OK and backend prints the JSON
[20:21:20] <robertmaxrees> uskerine so you needed to stringify the array.
[20:21:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you were asking for earlier ;)
[20:24:24] <uskerine> uhm
[20:24:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:27:20] <robertmaxrees> brb
[20:28:23] <uskerine> [{u'name': u'email', u'value': u'tad@ukevi.edu'}, {u'name': u'password', u'value': u'0Pa$$4uM^t3'}, {u'name': u'password_confirm', u'value': u'0Pa$$4uM^t3'}, ....
[20:28:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[20:29:00] <robertmaxrees> uskerine that looks like data to me.
[20:29:04] <uskerine> what if I would like {'email': 'tad@ukevi.edu', 'password': '0Pa$$4uM^t3', .... }
[20:29:05] <uskerine> ?
[20:29:26] <uskerine> it generates an array of objects with 'name' and 'value' for each input item in the form
[20:29:36] <robertmaxrees> i alreayd said that's what it'll do .
[20:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to manually build that yourself.
[20:29:48] <uskerine> I see
[20:29:55] <uskerine> better to adapt the backend to receive that then
[20:30:32] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[20:33:20] <robertmaxrees> woops
[21:35:48] <sky> is there a jqueryui specific channel?
[21:37:24] <sky> using jqueryui datepicker widget. current month has no selectable dates, so I'd like the widget to default to showing the first month with available dates
[21:37:43] <sky> pretty sure ive done this before, but cant seem to find how
[21:39:09] <D-rex> sky: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[21:39:44] <sky> right. but I dont want to select a default ate
[21:40:09] <sky> I just want when I click the widget, it shows me february instead of january
[21:40:57] <D-rex> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-defaultDate
