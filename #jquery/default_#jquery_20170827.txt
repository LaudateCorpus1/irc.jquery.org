[11:04:17] <_3by8> So I'm making some changes to a legacy app I've inherited and I'm having a problem with some stuff in the DOM being re-rendered at inopportune times. So what's happening is this: a div with class="switch" is rendered, the bootstrapSwitch library sees it, adds event listeners, etc. and then a custom script takes the div and re-renders it. I can't stop the div from being re-rendered but I figure there has to be a way to invoke bootstrapSw
[11:04:24] <_3by8> ...again, after it's been re-rendered.

[20:37:44] <sms> Hey, how can I listen for changes in a div
[20:37:58] <sms> What I have right now is $("#juice-transfer > #id_fromStore").change( function() {
[20:38:21] <sms> But I don't think you can use > symbol with .change?
