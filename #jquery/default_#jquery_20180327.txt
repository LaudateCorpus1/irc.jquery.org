[05:39:03] <loginoob> I am trying swipe events but i cannot see swipe up or down, there is only swipeleft and swiperight.
[05:39:18] <loginoob> Is there a way i can implement swipeup event?
[08:34:19] <webbb> hi
[08:34:28] <webbb> so there is JQuery UI and JQuery mobile
[08:34:36] <webbb> I want a datepicker that can be styled nicely, I got a ThemeRoller style
[08:34:42] <webbb> but it should also offer touch/native-like experience for mobile users
[08:34:46] <webbb> well, what can I use?
[10:58:05] <EugenA> $(document).on('click', '#loginSubmit', function(event) ... or $(document).on('click', '#loginSubmit', function() ? I don't neet event inside of my function
[11:03:00] <AdamPDotty> when you do not need it, skip it
[11:03:12] <AdamPDotty> second version is valid
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[12:25:31] <grapheti> weeeeee
[12:29:20] <physikoi> Hello #jquery ! I'm looking for a more flexible substitute for `$.getScript()`. Is it possible to check that a library is ready? Whaat about if a function is ready? Thank you
[12:29:57] <robertmaxrees> physikoi why isn't $.getScript() working for you?
[12:32:14] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: oh it works. However, I would prefer that all my "vendor" stuff be bundled into a common file, but it seems there is a time issue. My jquery plugins work also if I load them at thee bottom of the page with jquery loaded at the top.
[12:32:40] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to figure out a race condition?
[12:33:22] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: I'm going to say yes. Is that what is happening when one uses `$(document).ready()`?
[12:33:32] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> that just waits until the document is... ready heh
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> why you don't just include the scripts on the page instead of using getScript?
[12:34:26] <bomb> in JS, hippier is better
[12:34:27] <physikoi> Before trying to get into this bundling stuff, I used to use this library called headjs. It did the job quite nicely ... but now I'm trying to get with the times
[12:34:30] <bomb> /s
[12:34:46] <physikoi> :)
[12:34:53] <robertmaxrees> physikoi then you don't wanna use jq for that :)
[12:35:00] <robertmaxrees> not the right tool for bundling
[12:35:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into webpack for that.
[12:36:30] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: oh no, I know. I'm using fuse-box for bundling. The problem (I think) is that when I bundle jquery and my jquery plugins together is that there isn't enough time(?) for the plugins to load. Thatt is, I think they are loading to early. Honestly, I think I'm a bit beyond my understanding.
[12:37:01] <robertmaxrees> so then the issue has nothing to do with getScript :)
[12:37:03] <taplar> sounds a bit like poking at the dark
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> you need fusebox to treat jquery as a dependency for those plugins and let it handle that for you.
[12:37:34] <physikoi> taplar: that's how it felt trying to learn webpack for a month. So far, better luck with fuse-box
[12:38:02] <taplar> i meant that as more your question is sorta around "i think this is the problem"
[12:38:17] <taplar> it's hard to solve an unknown problem
[12:38:37] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: I think you used to magic words -- "treat jquery as a dependency". I feel like I saw something like that in the docs. OK, some reading to do
[12:39:05] <physikoi> taplar: Ah, ok. I agree :/
[12:39:48] <physikoi> I will try out some stuff based on the suggestions and then return. Hope everyone is having at least an OK day.
[12:40:43] <taplar> another day above ground
[12:43:14] <robertmaxrees> looks like fusebox wants you to load jquery globally via a shim.
[12:43:21] <robertmaxrees> which is where i'd start
[12:43:34] <robertmaxrees> since not all jquery plugins behave themselves when it comes to module loaders.
[12:44:27] <physikoi> *nods*
[12:52:48] <taplar> i installed npm like 8 times yesterday in a vm, lol
[12:53:37] <taplar> the linux repo version is fairly old and finding the command to update to latest stable took me a bit
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> yikes.  that sounds... entertaining?
[12:58:53] <taplar> it was a pita.  cause every time i got it wrong it some how corrupted my npm install, so i had to manually delete folders, lol
[12:59:31] <taplar> wanted to get it though cause the latest version of webpack wanted a later version of npm and node
[12:59:50] <taplar> and i wanted to update node anyway, because the version it offered wasn't fully es6 compliant iirc
[13:04:06] <jak2020> hi all
[13:04:25] <taplar> aloha
[13:06:45] <jak2020> accept a mysql question here? (off topic)
[13:07:22] <taplar> eh, it's super slow right now.  what's up?
[13:07:37] <jak2020> mysql question: how to generate a random number in this range: 50 to 400 ?
[13:08:03] <taplar> i'd have to google.  why do that in mysql?
[13:08:15] <jak2020> for update rows...
[13:08:31] <taplar> why not generate the number in whatever language is making the update?
[13:08:36] <jak2020> no problem i am working with: SELECT CAST(50 + RAND() * (400 - 50)) AS INT;
[13:08:47] <taplar> ah
[13:08:48] <jak2020> is an update to database not necessary on a program
[13:09:22] <taplar> well a range of 50 would be like (random number % 451)
[13:09:32] <taplar> well a range of 50 would be like (random number % 451 + 50)
[13:10:11] <taplar> modulus 451 will give you 0-450, and adding 50 will give you the 50-500
[13:10:29] <taplar> err, but you wanted 400, so back that down to 351
[13:10:36] <jak2020> ok, thanks
[13:10:38] <jak2020> understand
[13:10:39] <taplar> herp derp
[13:10:56] <jak2020> you worked with bootstrap ?
[13:11:04] <taplar> very little
[13:11:10] <taplar> mostly just the styles
[13:11:51] <jak2020> worked with class='from-control' ?
[13:12:24] <taplar> i think so, but i don't remember details
[13:12:28] <jak2020> when y put: <input type='text' class='form-control' />%  the symbol: % go to new line how to fix?
[13:12:58] <taplar> inspect the element and see if it has a display property on it's styling
[13:13:11] <jak2020> ok, thanks
[13:17:15] * taplar eyes grapheti
[13:17:32] <grapheti> hey bb
[13:18:51] <taplar> so the vuejs room says checkout gitter, which says checkout that other place
[13:18:56] <taplar> lol.  who maintains this stuff
[13:19:38] <grapheti> irc > gitter > discord lol
[13:20:14] <grapheti> This guy - https://github.com/yyx990803
[13:20:49] <grapheti> As to who's he has delegated things to, I dunno lol
[14:27:46] <physikoi> taplar: robertmaxrees seems the load order thing isn't solved by fusebox, so i'm falling back to headjs for that purpose. Still works like a charm
[14:47:17] <robertmaxrees> physikoi that sounds... wrong heh.
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:54:05] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: you think i'm missing something wrt fuse-box? Irrespective, might be a good idea to drop the author a comment
[16:01:43] <robertmaxrees> the docs mention your scenario.
[16:01:55] <robertmaxrees> loading jquery with plugins
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[17:25:02] <Anthaas> If I have a target from an event (e.target), how can I select its nth child and remove it?
[17:25:21] <robertmaxrees> $(e.target) gets you the jqury object.
[17:25:33] <robertmaxrees> then you just do your normal fu from there.
[17:25:33] <Anthaas> I've tried: $(target.children[index]).remove(); and target.children(`.chips:nth-child(${index})`).remove();
[17:26:03] <robertmaxrees> $(e.target).children().eq(n).remove();
[17:26:27] <Anthaas> children is a function?
[17:26:44] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking at the jquery method yes.
[17:27:13] <Anthaas> Ugh, thats fixed it - thanks.
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> most of the stuff you interact with on the jquery object is a method.
[17:27:57] <Anthaas> Good to know - I find JS so....unpredictable to use.
[17:28:02] <Anthaas> Thats JS in all its forms.
[17:28:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery is pretty consistent in that regard.
[17:28:42] <Anthaas> I guess I just need more practice with it all.
[17:28:44] <robertmaxrees> and that's not really a JS concern as much as it's a DOM concern :)
[17:28:48] <Anthaas> Back-end, Im absolutely flying by.
[17:29:24] <grapheti> Should try typescript if coming from back-end.
[17:29:41] <Anthaas> Hmm, I might have to give that a shot on a different project
[17:29:48] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily >.>
[17:30:01] <grapheti> I <3 ts
[17:30:03] <Anthaas> I hate that JS has such a monopoly on the front end haha
[17:30:13] <robertmaxrees> Anthaas heh, that's slowly changing.
[17:30:14] <Anthaas> Back-end I can pick from almost any language...
[17:30:31] <Anthaas> (Can someone remind me of the property to lower the text line on an input field?
[17:30:39] <Anthaas> )
[17:30:42] <robertmaxrees> and regardless of what you choose, you'll still need to learn the DOM apis.
[17:30:47] <robertmaxrees> "lower the text line"?
[17:31:27] <Anthaas> Yeah, so the text is entering into the field higher vertically than I would like.
[17:31:46] <robertmaxrees> you want CSS for that.
[17:31:54] <robertmaxrees> that what you mean?
[17:31:59] <Anthaas> yeah :)
[17:32:14] <Anthaas> You told me the property the other day, but it turns out I didnt need it, I just forgot it this time haha
[17:32:16] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're styling it.
[17:32:32] <Anthaas> line-height!
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that does, but OK.
[17:32:51] <Anthaas> Oh
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> that literally increases the line-height.  it can be abused to do that, buit that's not really what it's for :)
[17:33:30] <Anthaas> Is there some other property I need?
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're currently styling the input.
[17:34:44] <Anthaas> I think the other day I worked out I needed to adjust the line-height to 300%, which you pointed out was 3rem as long as I hadn't changed the text size?
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't recall having that convo at all.
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> and i tend to avoid rems.
[17:35:46] <Anthaas> Hmm, it may have been merkazu
[17:35:54] <Anthaas> Im almost sure it was you though :/
[17:36:12] <Anthaas> Either way - its fixed it. However if that is an abuse of it, I'd like to know the proper way?
[17:36:25] <robertmaxrees> aaaand again
[17:36:34] <Anthaas> (Im applying no styling)
[17:36:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what it looks like then?
[17:36:50] <Anthaas> So, its whatever materialize css's default is...
[17:37:37] <Anthaas> Without my change or with it?
[17:37:45] <robertmaxrees> without.
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> and i just kicked the logs for the last week or so, didn't see anything related to line-height at all
[17:39:02] <Anthaas> Ahhh, sorry - it must have been merkazu then
[17:39:12] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, https://i.imgur.com/zVfsG9C.png <--- without
[17:39:18] <robertmaxrees> the code my dude
[17:39:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:39:30] * Anthaas facepalms
[17:40:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6wx01pmb/ this has the css lib included.
[17:42:13] <Anthaas> Uhhh - that doesn't behave at all like mine does.
[17:42:20] <Anthaas> Hmm, one sec.
[17:42:55] <robertmaxrees> http://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> it looks like maybe your markup isn't what it should be.
[17:45:06] <Anthaas> I dont change the line-height anywhere :/
[17:45:50] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, https://dpaste.de/W1Ci
[17:46:19] <Anthaas> The only things I change are margins and paddings - to remove them for the most part...
[17:46:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:46:31] <robertmaxrees> wait
[17:46:56] <robertmaxrees> so you're modifying base styles to remove margins and paddings only to need to add them back it?
[17:46:57] <robertmaxrees> *in
[17:47:27] <Anthaas> Removing the paddings from text area doesn't fix this.
[17:47:34] <Anthaas> Or removing the removal of paddings rather
[17:47:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6wx01pmb/4/
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> so this is your issue?
[17:48:03] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, Not to such a degree, but yes.
[17:49:14] <Anthaas> I just wanted the text to hug the bottom line a little closer.
[17:49:32] <Anthaas> I should only remove padding bottom, it seems!
[17:50:19] <Anthaas> I feel like such a tit -.-
[17:50:23] <Anthaas> Sorry for wasting your time :/
[17:50:25] <robertmaxrees> still don't see why you're modifying base styles like that tho >.>
[17:51:15] <Anthaas> I want that to be the case for all textareas on this page
[17:51:18] <Anthaas> Is that not the done thing?
[17:51:26] <Anthaas> Or should I always create my own class and modify that?
[17:51:32] <Anthaas> (or use id)
[17:52:10] <robertmaxrees> ideally you'd use sass and do your own variables and then compile it.
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> so that the rest of the lib takes those changes into account.
[17:52:43] <Anthaas> I haven't gotten around to sass :/
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> heh, that will save you a TON of headaches down the roat.
[17:53:00] <robertmaxrees> *road
[17:53:18] <Anthaas> Oh Im sure - its why Ive not bothered looking at it in much detail yet haha
[17:53:25] <Anthaas> Oh save me
[17:53:27] <Anthaas> Shit haha
[17:53:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:53:38] <grapheti> Get sassy!
[17:54:19] <Anthaas> Id want someone to walk me through it tbh - helping me fix my css into sass along the way (as much as is reasonable to ask of another person)
[17:54:25] <Anthaas> Probably best not done at 11pm either haha
[17:54:44] <grapheti> http://css2sass.herokuapp.com/
[17:54:44] <grapheti> kek
[17:55:43] <Anthaas> grapheti, That, my friend, is how you earn yourself a bookmark!
[17:55:53] <grapheti> :D
[17:55:54] <Anthaas> I have wanted the variables in SASS for a LONG time...
[17:56:06] <Anthaas> I dont want to have to add a class to something just to apply a color I've only defined once
[17:56:18] <Anthaas> I know CSS does that now, but I can't seem to get it working haha
[17:57:45] <grapheti> tons of tutorials
[17:57:50] <grapheti> just start twerkin' on it
[17:57:51] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwRGJlUP7w&index=2&list=PLUoqTnNH-2XxOt7UsKlTqbfrA2ucGosCR
[18:00:06] <Anthaas> I'll get this feature done first, then I'll come back to it - Im not too far off done with this. Just got autocomplete working for chips.
[18:00:35] <Anthaas> I will no doubt be here tagging you and robert for help.
[18:00:42] <Anthaas> (If thats OK?)
[18:01:23] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCbXTrsl7NU&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBxQO2r_kmxn-0UqL_Rkj0t
[18:01:31] <Anthaas> (also, SASS vs SCSS?)
[18:01:33] <grapheti> sure, there's a #css channel as well
[18:01:50] <Anthaas> bookmarked
[18:02:38] <Anthaas> Whats interesting, is that tool revolved everything around the style rather than the selector
[18:03:39] <Anthaas> e.g. rather than saying .class { /* everything I want to do with .class */ }, it listed grouped selectors together that shared the same style, if that makes sense?
[18:04:07] <grapheti> That makes sense.
[18:04:24] <grapheti> It's more modular that way.
[18:07:44] <Anthaas> Hmm - this is going to be fun to do over the upcoming long weekend.
[18:08:26] <grapheti> :D
[18:08:43] <grapheti> Always show a fiddle, codepen, or w/e.
[18:09:23] <grapheti> I use codepen. But I use jsfiddle to show test cases.
[18:09:37] <Anthaas> Yeah - will do.
[18:09:53] <grapheti> https://codepen.io/Graphettion/
[18:10:11] <Anthaas> Is your name pronounced any differently to Cody?
[18:10:53] <grapheti> Nope. Just a weird Mom.
[18:11:40] <Anthaas> I've bookmarked your codepen page, because it has a decent example of Quill - something I am using in another project.
[18:11:54] <Anthaas> Hope thats OK?
[18:13:01] <grapheti> I don't care. I use anything you want. :D
[18:13:23] <Anthaas> I think I've added a few things to mine though (code and formulae buttons)
[18:13:32] <grapheti> sweet
[18:13:44] <Anthaas> I was using it for a blog site
[18:13:51] <Anthaas> Then saving blogs to files as HTML
[18:14:06] <Anthaas> then just including the html within the page that was rendered for that article.
[18:14:07] <grapheti> ah, cool
[18:14:21] <Anthaas> Worked nicely.
[18:14:49] <Anthaas> Right, Im off to bed! Night guys - thanks for the help!
[18:15:03] <grapheti> lata homie
[18:15:49] <grapheti> I miss you vue - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/RLOOjy
[20:05:57] <nakka> Hi, I have a bizarre issue. On a specific site, on some articles, my browser extension that uses jQuery refuses to work. Why doesn't jQuery work in those few cases ?
[20:06:20] <nakka> This is the specific page: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43550938
[20:09:54] <nakka> I can't understand why that specific page has an issue and all others don't
[21:59:27] <NaN> is it possible to get the clicked element from a list, without ussing magic jquery methods? ex: based on $('#parent').on('click', '.element-1, .element-2', function () { ... }) get if the click was on .element-1 or .element-2
[22:31:17] <shoky> NaN: `this` will be the clicked element
[22:34:57] <NaN> thanks shoky, I used it with className.indexOf() c:
