[05:59:01] <cusco> hi
[05:59:23] <cusco> for some reason .split() is returning a string insteaf of an array.. can't figure out why
[05:59:26] <cusco> http://paste.debian.net/1158963/
[05:59:43] <cusco> the first console log shows an array, the second shows a string
[05:59:48] <cusco> the typeof() says string
[06:05:31] <Rotfuchs> What does .prop('name') return?
[06:07:35] <cusco> prop('name') = 'form_somename_0'
[06:08:59] <cusco> just ran and got: start_hour_0
[06:09:17] <Rotfuchs> Hard to debug without a reproducible example
[06:09:30] <cusco> hmmm
[06:17:10] <cusco> how about this? http://paste.debian.net/1158966/
[06:33:04] <Rotfuchs> One day I will write a plugin for my client to warn me about cross-postings ... :/
[17:05:27] <ahiru> hello there
[17:05:47] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[17:05:56] <ahiru> how are you today?
[17:06:04] <robertmaxrees> well enough i suppose
[17:06:15] <ahiru> I need some help with my logic in this code
[17:06:22] <ahiru> https://codepen.io/felipemotand/pen/KKzKKLE?editors=1010
[17:06:45] <robertmaxrees> sure - what's up?
[17:07:03] <ahiru> what I need it to do is to show a different button when selected from the radio and checkbox
[17:07:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:07:55] <ahiru> it will be a payment button which will change fron one-time to recurring payment, and each one has an unique button
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  can we refactor this a little so it's easier to read/work with?
[17:08:21] <ahiru> alright
[17:09:00] <ahiru> the "repetir" checkbox means "repeat?", and it's not working with my current logic
[17:09:43] <ahiru> I know it's related with $(this).val(), but I couldn't find a good sort of it
[17:11:24] <robertmaxrees> sec
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdL8vwon/
[17:12:00] <robertmaxrees> start here - this way you aren't repeating the same things over and over - much easier to grok :)
[17:12:47] <robertmaxrees> second off - are you saying when you check/uncheck the checkbox, you want something to happen?
[17:13:30] <ahiru> yes, it should update the button to something, but it's being only erased
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> you only do a bunch of addClass and never anything else.
[17:13:58] <robertmaxrees> you never remove it from the one you want to show.
[17:14:38] <ahiru> eg. if the radio is R$500 and you deselect the checkbox, it should show the button "R$500 unique"
[17:14:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah.,
[17:14:59] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said :)
[17:15:03] <ahiru> or "Ãºnico", in my language
[17:15:20] <robertmaxrees> you only ever use .addClass('mostrar') - you never remove it later.
[17:15:25] <ahiru> then, if you click the checkbox again, it should change to R$500 recurring
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to update your logic.
[17:15:38] <ahiru> hmm
[17:16:06] <ahiru> sec
[17:16:18] <robertmaxrees> ah - i see what's up.
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> your css is bad :)
[17:16:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdL8vwon/8/
[17:17:00] <robertmaxrees> making it too complicated.
[17:18:10] <robertmaxrees> ahiru
[17:18:18] <ahiru> well, I didn't want to replace the last display, so I only made it alter when I added a new class
[17:19:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, then the issue is the repetir checkbnox.
[17:19:16] <ahiru> yes
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> that's easy - you're checking the wrong value :)
[17:19:55] <robertmaxrees> when you change the checkbox, $(this).val() is referring to the value of the checkbox.
[17:20:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to find the checked radio button.
[17:21:28] <ahiru> hmm
[17:22:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:22:10] <ahiru> just a sec
[17:22:24] <robertmaxrees> i might re-think your strategy here and instead break this into some discrete functions and handlers.
[17:23:27] <ahiru> hm
[17:23:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:23:40] <ahiru> trying to read your sintax
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> Where are you getting confused?
[17:25:42] <ahiru> since your changed the code format, I'm re-reading to so I can see the logic
[17:26:00] <robertmaxrees> it's the same as what you had before :)
[17:26:11] <ahiru> is it?
[17:26:13] <robertmaxrees> just grouped things using nested if statements.
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> and else if statements where appropriate.
[17:27:17] <ahiru> ohh
[17:27:22] <ahiru> now I'm seeing
[17:27:40] <ahiru> I also thought on doing it nested like that
[17:27:47] <robertmaxrees> you awlways should.
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> DRY :)
[17:27:52] <ahiru> ok
[17:28:23] <ahiru> what is this doing?
[17:28:25] <ahiru> if (!isChecked) {
[17:28:36] <ahiru> then a return
[17:28:45] <ahiru> is it saying "do nothing"?
[17:29:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[17:29:20] <ahiru> ok
[17:29:27] <robertmaxrees> so instead of doing if ($(this).is(':checked') && $(this).val() == '500' && checkRepetir.is(':not(:checked)')) { where you see if it's checked every time, you just check once and return early.
[17:30:06] <ahiru> hm
[17:30:39] <ahiru> then now I need to find a way to do the same with the checkbox first
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:31:10] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what the issue is.
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> so at the beginning of the handler, you're looking at $this.prop('checked') and $this.val()
[17:31:48] <ahiru> is that the checkbox doesn't have any of the values it's trying to find
[17:32:09] <robertmaxrees> right - you need to change those to look up the specific elements you care about.
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> though looking at it now, that isChecked return doesn't really make any sense.
[17:34:15] <ahiru> what if I add a value to the checkbox, then: if currentValue is '' || checkboxValue {
[17:34:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:34:30] <ahiru> let me write it
[17:34:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean the base concept doesn't make sense.
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't mean copy the value to the checkbox, right?
[17:35:01] <ahiru> no, add an unique one to it
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't make sense - you just need to look up the selected radio button.
[17:37:48] <ahiru> uhm
[17:37:50] <robertmaxrees> ahiru https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdL8vwon/16/
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> super minimal changes :)
[17:38:23] <ahiru> oh!
[17:39:13] <ahiru> $selectedRadio
[17:39:26] <robertmaxrees> that should really be $radioButtons
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdL8vwon/20/
[17:40:30] <ahiru> wow, I can't even understand lol
[17:40:37] <robertmaxrees> so ask questions :)
[17:41:02] <ahiru> ok
[17:41:14] <ahiru> $radioButtons.filter(':checked').val();
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:41:36] <ahiru> what is .filter() followed by .val() doing?
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> well, what's bein passed to .filter()?
[17:42:14] <ahiru> filter is saying if it's checked
[17:42:30] <ahiru> but why not .prop()?
[17:42:35] <robertmaxrees> yep - 'filter down to the ones that are 'checked'.
[17:42:51] <robertmaxrees> you could do that - you'd need to pass filter a function instead in that case.
[17:43:07] <ahiru> hm
[17:43:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:43:25] <ahiru> I see
[17:44:19] <robertmaxrees> also: there are now unused variabl;es in there.
[17:44:41] <robertmaxrees> and: those vars at the very top could use some cleanup, too :)
[17:45:13] <ahiru> ok
[17:45:54] <robertmaxrees> really, you should do var formDoacoes = $('#seamless-donations-form');, and then use .find() off of that for descendents.
[17:45:55] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdL8vwon/26/
[17:47:21] <ahiru> oh
[17:47:26] <ahiru> instead of +
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of concatenating strings over and over, yeah.
[17:48:03] <robertmaxrees> also: never prepend id selectors with tags :) just #idName - never form#idName
[17:48:18] <ahiru> why not?
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> IDs are unique.
[17:48:41] <ahiru> lol
[17:48:43] <ahiru> makes sense
[17:48:44] <robertmaxrees> and ID selectors are far faster.
[17:49:01] <ahiru> but I had this idea of making it easier to find what is was about
[17:49:18] <robertmaxrees> your IDs and classnames should be clear enough.
[17:49:22] <robertmaxrees> they should be semantic.
[17:49:56] <ahiru> ok
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> similar to why lots of people prepend variables that are jquery objects with $ - makes is easier to know what you're looking at.
[17:50:56] <ahiru> oh
[20:52:59] <ahiru> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[21:14:28] <robertmaxrees> def!  glad i could help/
