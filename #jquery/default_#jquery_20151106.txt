[00:50:52] <daslicht> wtf
[02:22:00] <zizzl> Hey guys I have an element that has a dynamic top margin depending on the window size.. I want to subtract from that value during a scroll function I have, how can I do that here jQuery(".mainSlideImage").css("margin-top", <current-margin-top> - scrollTop / 10);
[03:02:35] <Kartagis> $("#uploadotherpicture").on("click",function() {console.log('Clicked');}) <--- why does typing this in the console give me [] ?
[03:03:35] <Cork> #uploadotherpicture is not found
[03:04:58] <Kartagis> but it's on the DOM. devtools > Elements show me
[03:05:33] <Kartagis> gah
[03:05:37] <Kartagis> typo
[04:02:44] <Kartagis> suppose I've got 5 images of which I want to send base64 encoded strings over an ajax call from my phone and I'm determining the filename with Date.now(). now, when I push the button to send, will all the timestamps be the same or will there be some sort of delay?
[04:31:34] <Uhkis> The Date.now() method returns the number of milliseconds... likely different unless you set the time to variable and use the same
[04:32:54] <Cork> benjaminr: please stop playing with your nick...
[04:37:53] <jak2000> Uhkis, Cork offtopic question, know a good menus samples? with submenus? thanks
[04:38:23] <Cork> i think jquery ui has one
[04:38:34] <Cork> i usually make my own 99% css only
[04:38:47] <jak2000> yes
[04:38:50] <jak2000> any page to learn?
[04:38:53] <Cork> and then just a small js to extend it so it stays open
[04:38:57] <jak2000> listamatic is out of date
[04:39:09] <Cork> it isn't that much to learn
[04:39:16] <Uhkis> i use whatever drupal gives me :p
[04:39:30] <robhol> Kartagis: if you want something actually random, use something random.
[04:39:50] <Cork> jak2000: https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=css+dropdown+menu
[04:40:11] <Uhkis> robhol: like 4? :D
[04:40:30] <Cork> :)
[04:40:45] <Uhkis> https://xkcd.com/221/ for reference
[04:40:45] <b-ot> (Uhkis) xkcd: Random Number (9 February 2007)
[04:41:12] <Uhkis> b-ot: thanks!
[04:41:26] <Kartagis> robhol: I'm using imageData.replace(/\//g,"").replace(/\+/g,"").substr(100,50)+Date.now()+".jpg". I thought this was random enough but I always get Couldn't upload file
[04:41:29] * Cork gives b-ot a cookie
[04:41:44] <Uhkis> ?api attr
[04:41:45] <b-ot> we got dat
[04:42:22] <Cork> Kartagis: are you sure the server expects a string and not a file?
[04:42:25] <Uhkis> Cork: i hope that was tracking cookie or something else nasty. he doesn't deserve a real one with that functionality :D
[04:42:33] <Kartagis> yes
[04:42:42] <Cork> O_o
[04:42:44] <Cork> ok
[04:42:50] <jak2000> Cork thanks
[04:43:02] <Cork> (the web is filled with broken servers...)
[04:43:32] <Cork> Kartagis: and your sure the error comes from the name existing already?
[04:44:20] <Kartagis> Cork: I'm not 100% sure but I changed algorithm last night and that worked
[04:44:31] <Kartagis> algorythm ?
[04:45:53] <Uhkis> ?mdn substr
[04:46:06] <Uhkis> clearly not worthy of a cookie!
[04:46:45] <Uhkis> Kartagis: how long are those filenames of yours..?
[04:47:30] <Kartagis> Uhkis: just making a fiddle to demonstrate
[04:48:07] <Uhkis> Kartagis: because that substr requires at least 100 char names
[04:48:35] <Kartagis> Uhkis: oh, you mean base64? at least 100
[04:48:46] <Kartagis> depending on the size tho
[04:48:59] <Uhkis> i don't know what your "imageData" is
[04:50:00] <Kartagis> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z72nvLz7/
[04:50:12] <Kartagis> Uhkis: imageData is base64
[04:50:36] <Kartagis> it's returned by phonegap camera plugin
[04:54:24] <Uhkis> oh its just randomness
[04:59:17] <jomofcw> Hello !
[04:59:43] <Kartagis> Uhkis: can you suggest a solution for me?
[04:59:56] <jomofcw> Using jQuery UI I upgrade to the latest version (1.11.4). I was used to have a i18n folder. Can't find it in the download I just get. Is that" normal" ?
[05:00:46] <Uhkis> Kartagis: add some more debug output to the backend
[05:01:47] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I can only show you the relevant lines that give error. other than that I've got no access
[05:04:01] <Xatenev> jomofcw: they are in /ui/i18n
[05:04:02] <Kartagis> Uhkis: http://cgit.drupalcode.org/services/tree/resources/file_resource.inc?id=8e396f5#n149
[05:04:29] <Xatenev> jomofcw: if you dont have it in there, try redownloading a proper release version here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/releases
[05:05:59] <Uhkis> Kartagis: wheres _services_arg_value
[05:07:52] <Kartagis> http://cgit.drupalcode.org/services/tree/includes/services.runtime.inc?id=8e396f5#n380
[05:11:23] <Uhkis> Kartagis: well there's your problem
[05:11:36] <Kartagis> what is it? tell me tell me
[05:11:49] * Kartagis is all eyes
[05:12:35] <hellyeah> i know it is siple question butr can you help me to figure ut what did i do wrong here? I just want to change the image when button click. https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/44/
[05:12:46] <Kartagis> afaics, neither file nor filename are empty
[05:12:56] <Kartagis> devtools tells me that
[05:16:23] <Uhkis> Kartagis: is that $file a php array?
[05:16:41] <Kartagis> a js array
[05:17:33] <Uhkis> so it's a string to php so you probably have some notices in logs
[05:17:54] <jomofcw> Xatenev yup, I found it in the source on github. But doesn't have it in the downloaded package from the website.
[05:18:31] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I'm afraid I haven't ssh access to the server
[05:18:56] <Kartagis> Uhkis: and dblog tells me zilch
[05:19:14] <Kartagis> (yes, it's a Drupal website)
[05:20:11] <Uhkis> Kartagis: well, it's impossible to debug then
[05:22:28] <Kartagis> Uhkis: also, the owner of the webserver can't turn on error.log
[05:22:30] <Kartagis> :S
[05:22:59] <Kartagis> and he doesn't let me teamviewer in and let me do it
[05:26:26] <hellyeah> no imagew why is that :/ https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/50/
[05:37:41] <matteagle> Hi there! I just migrated a website from test space to live, and now menus are not working anymore. I suspect it to be a jquery conflict, as I can select the menu via jQuery('#mobile-menu') and not via $('#mobile-menu'). The site is www.optimahl.com - anyone has an idea?
[05:38:07] <matteagle> (and = but)
[05:38:12] <jomofcw> When I call the "i18n/datepicker-fr.js" it throw me error :/...
[05:38:36] <alex_____> hello
[05:38:39] <alex_____> can somebody please help me?
[05:39:08] <jomofcw> alex_____ you shall ask what we can do to help you, instead of asking if we can help :)0.
[05:39:32] <alex_____> i am using standard code to disable submit button upon form submit
[05:39:38] <chingyy938_> Hi guys is it possible to display e.g. " Updated X seconds ago " each time my script is executed? It will display a timer counting up in seconds.
[05:39:40] <alex_____> however it does not work after the form has been submited once
[05:39:58] <Cork> matteagle: something most likely runs jQuery.noConflict()
[05:40:09] <Cork> $ doesn't seams to be used by anything
[05:40:13] <alex_____> http://pastebin.com/5TJsvwjf heres my code
[05:41:41] <alex_____> can no1 help?
[05:42:08] <Kartagis> Uhkis: you said "there you go", which I assumed you have spotted the error
[05:43:31] <Kartagis> alex_____: because you disable it
[05:43:49] <Kartagis> ugh
[05:43:51] <alex_____> yeah
[05:43:58] <alex_____> it works as intended on first form submit
[05:44:03] <alex_____> however second one dont work
[05:44:04] <Kartagis> you already said that
[05:44:22] <Kartagis> maybe because of ready?
[05:44:58] <alex_____> nop
[05:45:36] <jomofcw> alex_____ why do you want the form to be submit twice ? And is there any ajax load on that form ?
[05:45:56] <alex_____> no i dont want the form to be submited once
[05:46:01] <alex_____> i want to prevent double submition
[05:46:54] <alex_____> http://pastebin.com/WBbpwEBF
[05:47:02] <alex_____> that works on first submit, however second submit the code does nothing
[05:47:13] <jomofcw> alex_____ and so it doesn't do the trick ?
[05:47:14] <alex_____> heres my page http://www.dozenwinks.co.uk/emailSubscription/emailOptIn.php
[05:47:23] <alex_____> if you test it on that page
[05:47:30] <alex_____> u can press submit once, it will be disabled
[05:47:37] <alex_____> however second time u press it does nothing
[05:47:41] <jomofcw> I don't understand... you want you form to be not submit twice... you said that on the first call it work... but on the second it doesn't.... it's non sens.
[05:47:58] <jomofcw> alex_____... it's the aim of your code...
[05:48:14] <alex_____> jomofcw i didnt explain it properly
[05:48:19] <alex_____> go to this site http://www.dozenwinks.co.uk/emailSubscription/emailOptIn.php
[05:48:25] <alex_____> and press submit once
[05:48:31] <alex_____> u can see the submit gets disabled
[05:48:32] <jomofcw> what did you expect on the second time you click submit
[05:48:45] <alex_____> second time it should be disabled untill form submited again
[05:48:58] <alex_____> u press submit once on the site, and then u can keep spamming submit
[05:50:03] <alex_____> do you know what i mean?
[05:50:15] <jomofcw> OK it's not a jQuery problem
[05:50:34] <alex_____> then what is?
[05:50:53] <jomofcw> You have two "id" "test" after the POST :).
[05:51:05] <jomofcw> So he can't focus the right one. An "id" should always be "uniq" :).
[05:51:14] <jomofcw> Here you are ^^
[05:51:46] <jomofcw> When the form reload with error you add an input of the form that has the "id" "test".
[05:51:57] <alex_____> dawg cheers
[05:51:57] <jomofcw> This one isn't in the original HTML before submiting.
[05:52:02] <alex_____> i left that one by mistake
[05:52:05] <jomofcw> ^^
[05:52:10] <alex_____> i was debugging and forgot to remove it
[05:52:11] <alex_____> lmao
[05:52:13] <jomofcw> It will work better without :P.
[05:52:21] <alex_____> yeah its fixed now
[05:52:22] <alex_____> cheers
[05:52:25] <jomofcw> np =)
[05:53:10] <jomofcw> So now... is there someone for my i18n problem :x ? I add the load of my "i18n/datepicker-fr.js" but there's an error in it... it's the original one :/...
[05:53:37] <jomofcw> TypeError: e is undefined (...jQuery.datepicker)}(function(e){return e.regional.fr={closeText:"Fermer",prevTex...)
[05:54:37] <jomofcw> OK, fixed ^^. I have to lod jQuery UI BEFORE the i18n thing ^^ on the previous verson it didn't mater.
[06:00:02] <chingyy938_> guys how can i run only 1 instance of this? http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/330/
[06:01:37] <chingyy938_> e.g. how can i stop the previouse instance before starting a new script execution ?
[06:01:39] <chingyy938_> previous*
[06:03:06] <jomofcw> init a global var, then set this var to true when starting the trick and to false when it finish (complete). Test at the strat if the value of the var is false to continue.
[06:03:38] <jomofcw> anyway, 1000ms shall let to the browser the time to execute it...
[06:04:03] <jomofcw> O'm not sure to understand well your question...
[06:04:12] <jomofcw> s/0'm/I'm/
[06:04:14] <chingyy938_> i think i understand
[06:04:24] <chingyy938_> thanks
[06:05:10] <StephenS> real quick, I have two objects of jSON type, how do I elect the first one?
[06:05:28] <hellyeah> hey
[06:05:38] <hellyeah> can i animate buttons's color? http://jsfiddle.net/qcewrxcq/20/
[06:06:41] <jomofcw> StephenS what do you mean "select" ?
[06:07:18] <jomofcw> StephenS JSON work like an usual Javascript Object. So you can do "myJSONSource[0]" if it's an array of object.
[06:07:19] <StephenS> [{successNew: true, stat: "OK"}, {success: false, status: "Ooops."}]
[06:07:35] <jomofcw> StephenS ^
[06:07:39] <StephenS> I tried that, such as msg[0] but its not picking the first one object
[06:07:44] <StephenS> I'm getting only {
[06:07:51] <hellyeah> json is string
[06:07:59] <hellyeah> you may need to parse it
[06:08:10] <StephenS> I am
[06:08:11] <StephenS> var obj=JSON.parse(msg[0]);
[06:08:22] <jomofcw> hellyeah : https://jqueryui.com/animate/
[06:08:24] <StephenS> but msg[0] returns { only
[06:08:33] <StephenS> only one char, not a whole obj
[06:08:39] <hellyeah> what about obj[0]
[06:08:42] <jomofcw> StephenS not that way. You'll get the [0] FTER parsinhg
[06:08:55] <jomofcw> hellyeah is right :).
[06:09:28] <hellyeah> you are parsing msg[0] but still try to get msg[0]
[06:09:31] <StephenS> I get msg as full response with two objects, now what
[06:09:42] <hellyeah> you have thing what you want in obj
[06:09:59] <StephenS> ah
[06:10:05] <hellyeah> .forEach
[06:10:06] <StephenS> I must be really sleepy right now to not realize that
[06:10:34] <hellyeah> obj.forEach(function(element,index){ console.log(obj[0] }); may be
[06:11:09] <StephenS> hmm my json is wrong then, jQuery cannot parse it
[06:11:21] <hellyeah> debug it
[06:11:30] <StephenS> I get this [{successNew: true, stat: "OK"}, {success: false, status: "Ooops."}]
[06:11:33] <hellyeah> console.log(obj);
[06:11:58] <hellyeah> StephenS: this seems json array
[06:12:13] <hellyeah> actually usual js array with json notation if i am not wrong
[06:12:35] <StephenS> so?
[06:12:41] <hellyeah> just a sec
[06:16:48] <StephenS> hmm my json is not valid
[06:16:48] <StephenS> sec
[06:16:51] <hellyeah> StephenS: https://jsfiddle.net/xg1o1u4p/7/ check the console
[06:17:15] <hellyeah> and then remove /* */ and comment out  line 4
[06:17:28] <hellyeah> check the console you will see whats going on
[06:18:01] <hellyeah> check the result seems i can get index and i can get what i need and JSON.stringify it
[06:18:06] <hellyeah> i am not so good about that
[06:18:21] <hellyeah> but if your json is not valid, json.Stringify  would not work
[06:18:44] <StephenS> got string "{"
[06:18:47] <hellyeah> for sure jomofcw knows better than me
[06:18:47] <StephenS> which I already knew
[06:18:54] <jomofcw> http://jsonlint.com/
[06:19:03] <hellyeah> StephenS: can you fiddle it?
[06:19:07] <StephenS> no
[06:19:11] <hellyeah> why not
[06:19:14] <StephenS> but I gave you output
[06:19:22] <StephenS> json is not formatted correctly
[06:19:25] <StephenS> I need other way around
[06:19:34] <hellyeah> did you check my example?
[06:19:57] <hellyeah> when you parse your json string it become usual js array
[06:20:11] <hellyeah> so you can do forEach or you can get index manually
[06:20:17] <hellyeah> i covered both cases
[06:20:22] <jomofcw> all the string shall be encapsulated in "
[06:20:55] <jomofcw> [{"successNew": "true", "stat": "OK"}, {"success": "false", "status": "Ooops."}]
[06:21:07] <hellyeah> StephenS: https://jsfiddle.net/xg1o1u4p/9/
[06:21:12] <jomofcw> [{"successNew": true, "stat": "OK"}, {"success": false, "status": "Ooops."}]
[06:21:16] <hellyeah> first char of string cases
[06:25:35] <jomofcw> anytips on how to use the "ui-icon-calendar" class ? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3941
[06:26:10] <hellyeah> StephenS: there is a little mistake here not so good but check this out you understand how it works https://jsfiddle.net/xg1o1u4p/20/
[06:26:22] <hellyeah> jomofcw: what is my mistake here https://jsfiddle.net/xg1o1u4p/20/
[06:32:11] <hellyeah> why i coldnt animate color o fbutton http://jsfiddle.net/qcewrxcq/26/
[06:33:22] <jomofcw> hellyeah same error as previsouly : https://jsfiddle.net/xg1o1u4p/21/
[06:34:30] <jomofcw> You can't "animate color" without a plugin. Use the jQuery UI one, the one I linked to you previously : https://jqueryui.com/animate/
[06:34:52] <hellyeah> ops sorry i missed that
[06:35:01] <hellyeah> StephenS: take a look at /21/
[06:35:05] <jomofcw> ;)
[06:35:51] <jomofcw> And anyway StephenS, use the JSON parser of jQuery.
[06:36:02] <jomofcw> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsejson/
[06:46:57] <hellyeah> jomofcw: i didnt animate arrow here cazn you help me http://jsfiddle.net/qcewrxcq/35/
[06:52:18] <jomofcw> hellyeah you missunderstood what animate is imo...
[06:52:27] <jomofcw> What did you expect in your example ?
[06:52:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:52:57] <hellyeah> i expect to see change the color of image
[06:54:59] <hellyeah> brb

[07:03:36] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I've now got to see what the difference between two servers is

[07:09:42] <Kartagis> I'm wondering if this is because of a patch applied earlier
[07:10:06] <Kartagis> I imported the services from the working server
[07:14:33] <ocx> anyone?
[07:21:21] <hellyeah> i try to add class animation to the button. Is it wrong way to do it? http://jsfiddle.net/qcewrxcq/40/
[07:30:52] <chingyy938_> hi guys how can i remove the 0 once it starts counting up?http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/332/ thanks
[07:34:16] <hellyeah> chingyy938: http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/335/
[07:37:32] <hellyeah> pls help
[07:41:49] <taplar> hellyeah: why don't you just add the animate class to the element?
[07:41:56] <taplar> not sure what your doing with the if
[07:42:41] <hellyeah> there will be circumstances later
[07:42:57] <hellyeah> i just check i will do it with if
[07:43:23] <taplar> ok, so what's your question?
[07:43:56] <hellyeah> i want to add animation to the button
[07:44:05] <hellyeah> but as i can see there is no blue animation
[07:44:18] <hellyeah> but tutorial said this to me
[07:44:20] <hellyeah> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/
[07:44:35] <taplar> blur
[07:44:35] <hellyeah> my mistake is in addClass or something else
[07:44:43] <taplar> and it's not an animation
[07:44:50] <taplar> it's a style property
[07:45:02] <hellyeah> i actually blur the button
[07:45:07] <taplar> yep
[07:45:22] <hellyeah> sorry it is not animation
[07:45:23] <chingyy938_> guys any idea why my timer on the left stops working but the right one works? https://gbtc.us/
[07:45:36] <hellyeah> my intend is to give extra focus to use when something goes wrong
[07:45:45] <hellyeah> bluring button can give a hint to the user
[07:45:51] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ whree is a timer here?
[07:45:56] <Xatenev> ah i see
[07:46:02] <chingyy938_> Xatenev:  ya
[07:46:04] <taplar> bluring something also makes it hella hard to read
[07:46:05] <chingyy938_> xd
[07:46:12] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ what is the goal of this timer?
[07:46:18] <Xatenev> the right one doesnt look like it works tho. x)
[07:46:21] <Xatenev> it goes 1-3 and then 1 again
[07:46:25] <hellyeah> taplar: yeah but i just blue the button
[07:46:28] <taplar> better option is to provide an error message and/or an error border or soemthing
[07:46:46] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: it's supposed to restart the timer e.g. 2 seconds ago
[07:46:50] <taplar> bluring something on an error is very werid
[07:46:51] <chingyy938_> the timer is connected to the price
[07:47:02] <hellyeah> taplar: i am just learning stuff
[07:47:02] <chingyy938_> two different timers for two of the prices
[07:47:17] <taplar> users don't typically associate blur with error
[07:47:18] <hellyeah> there is really good amount off css filter here
[07:47:25] <chingyy938_> each time the price is requested it should restart the timer
[07:47:33] <hellyeah> like playing around
[07:47:40] <taplar> that's fine
[07:47:55] <hellyeah> opacity can be better
[07:47:55] <taplar> but if your going to impliment something to fufill a business need, it needs to be understandable to the users
[07:47:57] <taplar> and expected
[07:48:09] <hellyeah> increasing opacity and reducing opacity respectively
[07:48:13] <taplar> -_
[07:48:22] <hellyeah> -_ what does that mean?
[07:48:25] <taplar> -_-
[07:48:38] <hellyeah> i dont know that one also xD
[07:48:44] <taplar> it's a sad face
[07:48:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:48:55] <hellyeah> what about brightness
[07:48:59] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: did i explain correctly xd
[07:49:04] <taplar> hellyeah:
[07:49:12] <taplar> you want your ui to be intuitive
[07:49:19] <hellyeah> yes
[07:49:23] <taplar> the less you have to explain to your users, the better
[07:49:32] <Xatenev> chingyy938 u would have to show code
[07:49:32] <Xatenev> xD
[07:49:42] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ too much abstract things i can juts imagine how they could work :p
[07:49:49] <hellyeah> taplar: do you have spesific suggestion?
[07:49:52] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ and basically i dont wanna crawl ur site for ur JS files.. :P
[07:49:54] <taplar> i already gave two
[07:50:02] <taplar> messages and/or error borders
[07:50:16] <hellyeah> error borders on image
[07:50:25] <taplar> both are common elements on an error, thus users understand them intuitive now days
[07:50:26] <hellyeah> ?
[07:50:33] <taplar> you can
[07:50:39] <hellyeah> humm
[07:50:47] <taplar> typically the border goes on the field that has the error
[07:50:52] <hellyeah> like coloring border of image?
[07:51:00] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/337/
[07:51:14] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: sorry xd
[07:51:33] <chingyy938_> it is just the html and js, i can apply the css if you want :P
[07:51:50] <chingyy938_> oh i have to add both timers sec
[07:52:33] <hellyeah> border-color
[07:54:24] <chingyy938_> http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/338/ Xatenev
[07:57:00] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ maybe no JS?
[07:57:04] <Xatenev> atleast in ur jsfiddle
[07:57:08] <Xatenev> jquery i mena
[07:57:24] <Xatenev> basically in ur working counter ur using plain JS which always works
[07:57:29] <Xatenev> and in the counter which doesnt work ur using jquery
[07:58:15] <chingyy938_> umm
[07:58:23] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: the jquery one counts up to 2 then stops
[07:58:31] <chingyy938_> on my site
[07:58:38] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ then ur jsfiddle is still wrong
[07:58:39] <chingyy938_> i tried javascript for both
[07:58:51] <chingyy938_> oh ok sec
[07:58:55] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ include jquery  in ur fiddle, in the fiddle the counter is on 0
[07:59:14] <Xatenev> chingyy938_ create a real working testcase where we can see the issue so we are atleast able to help ._.
[08:02:12] <chingyy938_> Xatenev: ah i had two functions with the same name thats why one wasn't working
[08:02:16] <chingyy938_> thanks for the help :D
[08:02:32] <taplar> hellyeah: small example http://jsfiddle.net/z8wr5g85/
[08:04:22] <hellyeah> seeems nice
[08:04:28] <taplar> things like this also are already implemented in certain plungs like validatejs
[08:05:03] <jomofcw> hellyeah re. Is your problem fixed ?
[08:05:21] <hellyeah> yes
[08:05:27] <hellyeah> i am in different one now
[08:07:25] <hellyeah> always ideas come to my mind
[08:07:36] <hellyeah> that make me feel suck
[08:08:51] <taplar> there's a place for everything.  the important thing is to realize when your using things to solve a problem and when your using things just for the sake of using things
[08:09:29] <hellyeah> actually button will be colored
[08:09:40] <hellyeah> they will have own counter for colorized records
[08:09:47] <hellyeah> i will show in the div
[08:09:54] <hellyeah> and arrow will expand the div
[08:10:07] <hellyeah> but user look many screens
[08:10:33] <hellyeah> at the same time so if i give something extra to user like warning mechanism on button
[08:10:44] <hellyeah> they will get attention more
[08:11:17] <taplar> what's the error?
[08:13:07] <hellyeah> there is some situtation
[08:13:27] <hellyeah> i am doin webrequest to get http status code briefly and responsetime of server
[08:14:24] <hellyeah> record can be 200 it means success -> green records can have 404, 501 it means failure red records. Records can have performance problems like late response it means record is orange.
[08:14:40] <hellyeah> so i hjave to colorize button by checking table
[08:14:52] <hellyeah> i mean button color can be red, orange, green
[08:15:05] <hellyeah> so they have counter also onto button
[08:15:28] <hellyeah> buttons will be kept in the div you can enlarge the div by clicking arrow button or narrow it
[08:15:45] <taplar> you mean those status codes come back from the request which is executed on the button click?
[08:15:46] <hellyeah> my situtation is like that
[08:16:17] <hellyeah> when you click button it will get spesific data as json
[08:16:31] <hellyeah> and i make it table to show on the browser
[08:16:41] <hellyeah> function in the backend has three parameters
[08:16:58] <hellyeah> when you click the button those parameter will send to function in the backend
[08:17:24] <hellyeah> i will colorize table in js by checking some colun value like statuscode or responsetime
[08:17:52] <hellyeah> button will be also colored in case spesific table has red records or orange records or green records
[08:18:15] <hellyeah> so there will be a counter that indicates like how many red records there are
[08:18:29] <taplar> hold on
[08:18:49] <taplar> so your doing an ajax request to get the table data, yes?
[08:19:37] <hellyeah> yes
[08:19:41] <hellyeah> as json
[08:19:43] <taplar> and that table contains 'records'
[08:19:51] <hellyeah> yes
[08:20:05] <taplar> of which, they have status codes, 200, 404, 501, etc.
[08:20:15] <hellyeah> yes
[08:20:29] <hellyeah> they have also responsetime
[08:20:34] <taplar> what is this information?  like displaying an http log?
[08:20:59] <hellyeah> like urladdress, starttime, endtime, difference, statuscode, state
[08:21:10] <taplar> sounds like an http log
[08:21:18] <taplar> anyway, ok
[08:21:42] <taplar> so you want to colorize the rows so it is easier to group like data together just by looking
[08:22:07] <hellyeah> ye
[08:22:11] <hellyeah> http log we can say
[08:22:28] <taplar> alright, making more sense.  just trying to work through it
[08:22:34] <hellyeah> taplar: colorize rows for someone who deservers the record
[08:22:40] <hellyeah> i work in a bank
[08:22:55] <hellyeah> so many services here need to check everytime
[08:23:14] <hellyeah> and when problem occurds, records the necessary information to related department
[08:23:21] <hellyeah> so as to fixx the problem right away
[08:23:41] <hellyeah> because if you cannot realize suddently
[08:23:51] <hellyeah> you can lose customer that means losing monety
[08:23:54] <hellyeah> so
[08:24:13] <taplar> i'm not sure how logging the information relates to fixing it right away
[08:24:22] <hellyeah> taplar: well
[08:24:30] <taplar> if someone isn't watching the log constantly, it won't be fixed immediately
[08:24:32] <hellyeah> i have also exceptionmessage, stacktrace
[08:24:46] <hellyeah> we have people who checks the table
[08:24:50] <hellyeah> 7/24
[08:24:57] <taplar> ok
[08:25:04] <hellyeah> but they check many tables
[08:25:11] <hellyeah> different tables at the same time
[08:25:17] <taplar> seems like a better process could be put in place to shoot of an email or something on one of those errors, but whatever
[08:25:22] <hellyeah> so i have to make life easier for them
[08:25:43] <hellyeah> taplar: emailling is done
[08:25:48] <hellyeah> we have this system
[08:25:59] <hellyeah> i just want to prepare good front-end
[08:26:12] <taplar> if they have an email, what is lacking that this screen provides?
[08:26:36] <hellyeah> well they check the logs and if there is a problem they email like
[08:26:54] <hellyeah> this service give me failure or this service response lately than we expect
[08:26:59] <taplar> wait
[08:27:03] <taplar> you said there was already an email
[08:27:04] <hellyeah> i am waiting
[08:27:13] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[08:27:25] <hellyeah> i mean they prepare content
[08:27:30] <hellyeah> and emailed it
[08:27:38] <taplar> can you not do that programatically?
[08:27:49] <hellyeah> taplar: probably you can
[08:27:58] <hellyeah> but thats not my responsibility now
[08:28:23] <hellyeah> i dont know exactly how that system works
[08:28:27] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie here
[08:28:35] <taplar> i would think it would be worth bringing up to someone
[08:28:48] <taplar> after all, you say you have people watching those logs 24/7
[08:28:54] <taplar> that means your paying people to do that
[08:29:01] <hellyeah> yes
[08:29:07] <taplar> if you can automize that, that could potentially be a cost saver
[08:29:13] <hellyeah> taplar: they have heavy work flow
[08:29:32] <taplar> it would also minimize the amount of time between the exception and the time it gets alerted to the necessary people
[08:29:34] <hellyeah> thats why i try to make a good frontend
[08:30:02] <hellyeah> as i said i dont know full system
[08:30:11] <hellyeah> but let me tell my design here
[08:30:20] <hellyeah> i will have a div div contains button
[08:30:22] <hellyeah> s
[08:30:29] <hellyeah> you can enlarge or narrow the div
[08:30:47] <hellyeah> when you click the button it will call the method from backend
[08:31:05] <hellyeah> and get the related table according to parameters that we send from ajax
[08:31:23] <hellyeah> and i will make this json obj table, colorize it
[08:31:35] <taplar> you'll make a table
[08:31:43] <taplar> no such thing as a json table, or object table
[08:31:45] <hellyeah> yes
[08:31:45] <taplar> heh
[08:31:49] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:31:51] <hellyeah> :D
[08:31:53] <hellyeah> xD
[08:31:58] <hellyeah> fast typing
[08:32:04] * hellyeah xD
[08:32:11] <hellyeah> i will make this table
[08:32:24] <hellyeah> table has red, orange, green, gray and blue records
[08:32:42] <taplar> question
[08:32:48] <hellyeah> so buttons will be red or orange or gray if related records haev that colors
[08:32:54] <hellyeah> taplar: i am reading
[08:32:57] <taplar> why show green records?
[08:33:18] <hellyeah> green records mean succesful probably you understand
[08:33:23] <taplar> yup
[08:33:29] <hellyeah> i asked for not showing
[08:33:39] <hellyeah> but they have own reason to show it
[08:33:47] <taplar> ?
[08:33:55] <hellyeah> i dont know honestly
[08:34:00] <taplar> lol
[08:34:04] <taplar> so
[08:34:13] <taplar> there are potentially many many many records
[08:34:15] <hellyeah> personally prefer not showing
[08:34:19] <taplar> hopefully most are green
[08:34:27] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:34:29] <taplar> and your going to make the user scrooooooooool, until they find a bad one
[08:34:29] <hellyeah> let say
[08:34:40] <hellyeah> records are green next time can be red
[08:34:46] <hellyeah> ah okey
[08:34:53] <hellyeah> i did something tricky for that
[08:35:09] <hellyeah> i will sort it in sql like red, orange, gray, green, blue
[08:35:27] <hellyeah> so if record is green and nexttime is red
[08:35:34] <hellyeah> it will be moved to the top
[08:35:55] <hellyeah> green and blue records stay in the position that you dont have to focus on
[08:36:01] <hellyeah> i will handle it with that
[08:36:04] <hellyeah> ops
[08:36:06] <hellyeah> handled*
[08:37:49] <taplar> another option you could do for that would be to provide a filter option
[08:38:12] <hellyeah> taplar:
[08:38:17] <hellyeah> this is the sql i did http://dpaste.com/0NFVZKG
[08:38:26] <taplar> regardless
[08:38:40] <taplar> it could be helpful to let the user choose what they see
[08:38:47] <taplar> return it all, sort it like you are
[08:38:48] <hellyeah> web page can have filter thing
[08:39:01] <taplar> but if they want to only see certain color(s), why not
[08:39:04] <hellyeah> table will have sort capacity in every column
[08:39:13] <hellyeah> when you hit the column you can sort it
[08:39:23] <Twirl> hey, anyone knows how to bind a click event to a hamburger icon? bc i'm trying jQuery('.fusion-icon').click(console.log('a')); and i'ts not working, is it the wrong element or what?
[08:39:37] <hellyeah> jquery has table sorter plugin
[08:39:40] <taplar> Twirl: your trying to bind with a function invocation
[08:39:48] <taplar> you need to give it a function definition
[08:39:56] <hellyeah> let me tell this part
[08:40:10] <hellyeah> i have to color the button also and put counter on it
[08:40:25] <Twirl> taplar: oh, silly me, ty
[08:40:29] <hellyeah> so but when you see div default it is nnot wide to see all button
[08:40:38] <hellyeah> you can enlarge it to see all buttons
[08:40:45] <hellyeah> by clicking arrow button
[08:41:09] <hellyeah> but i want to give them a tips in case any of button has potantial problematic records
[08:41:18] <taplar> hellyeah: what your describing is more going into a design discussion.  we're kinda getting off track for the channel
[08:41:41] <hellyeah> taplar: i just told my system design
[08:41:52] <taplar> which is not a jquery question, :)
[08:42:00] <hellyeah> yea i know
[08:43:07] <hellyeah> there's a place for everything.  the important thing is to realize when your using things to solve a problem and when your using things just for the sake of using things
[08:43:18] <hellyeah> so this sentence inspired me
[08:43:22] <hellyeah> thanks for listening
[08:43:38] <hellyeah> one last question does it make sense to you?
[08:43:55] <taplar> np.  i just realized we were talking about it for quite a while and we were getting off track, heh
[08:44:42] <taplar> i can't really visualize it that well to be honest.  as you might have guessed from some of my questions, I have reservations about the whole screen, :)
[08:44:59] <hellyeah> but
[08:45:08] <hellyeah> you are really teaching me stuff
[08:45:10] <hellyeah> thank you
[08:45:21] <hellyeah> sincerely
[08:45:28] <hellyeah> i will be back
[08:45:33] <taplar> np.  i'm just a dude at a keyboard
[08:45:39] <hellyeah> eheh
[08:45:50] <hellyeah> glad to see not egocentric person
[08:46:00] <hellyeah> -i will be back
[08:56:01] <bfig> how can I make same scope droppables to highlight when I'm dragging?
[08:56:46] <Twirl> how to select ".item li a" ?
[08:58:25] <Twirl> nvm, it worked just like that lol
[08:58:38] <Twirl> bfig: ur question is incomplete
[08:59:11] <Twirl> what droppables are you talking about? where are you dragging? what do you mean with highlight?
[08:59:14] <bfig> activeClass i think is my answer, let me check that out
[08:59:28] <bfig> i thought it was evident that it was a jqueryui question, sorry
[09:04:37] <ocx> hi
[09:04:45] <taplar> yo
[09:04:46] <ocx> how can i get a callback from a $ajax get
[09:04:58] <ocx>   success: function(x) { alert('Success!'+x); } doesnt return anything in x
[09:05:07] <taplar> callbacks don't 'return'
[09:05:23] <ocx> taplar: my request is going through how can i read the response from the server
[09:05:40] <km4> hi :)
[09:05:49] <taplar> success: function(data){ console.log(data); }
[09:06:11] <taplar> or 'x'.  just a parameter name
[09:06:34] <ocx> success: function(data){ console.log(data); < taplar i get nothing in data
[09:06:47] <OnceMe> hello, When I encode html input and try to send it via ajax, I get this in header amp;nbsp;:
[09:07:01] <taplar> check your network console and inspect the request, see if you are indeed getting anything or nothing back
[09:07:21] <OnceMe> but like it's a new param to be send, not part of param I wanted to be sent
[09:07:33] <km4> how can I save my choose if I open dropdownmenu ? I need save this "event" and if refresh page I have the same menu open ?
[09:11:40] <taplar> km4: you can store the value in sessionStorage/localStorage and check that on page load to restore the selection
[09:14:53] <km4> taplar: there is no other option?
[09:16:02] <taplar> maybe cookies, but session storage and local storage are basicly cookies
[09:16:20] <taplar> and your talking about preserving data between page views
[09:17:59] <km4> ok then go use localStorage
[09:19:21] <taplar> just be aware the localstorage is persistent
[09:19:34] <taplar> sessionstorage automatically invalidates itself when the user closes the browser
[09:43:26] <km4> can I check localstorage before load body ?
[09:44:39] <decx> have it in the head
[09:46:24] <km4> i have in the head
[09:49:02] <ocx> hi all
[09:49:16] <ocx> i received an [Object object] as reply how can i output that as json?
[09:50:51] <taplar> JSON.stringify
[10:03:09] <decx> console log all the things
[10:12:19] <jop008> I have an onchange trigger I want to do something when the user is changing the field and not when it is done using jscrpt
[10:12:32] <jop008> how can I distinguish those 2 types of changes
[10:13:30] <decx> change only fires on actual user input
[10:13:39] <jop008> $( #myTextbox').on('input', function() {
[10:13:39] <jop008>     // do something
[10:13:40] <jop008> });
[10:13:52] <jop008> no it fires also on change by program
[10:14:18] <decx> nope
[10:14:43] <noahmg123> I have a jQuery plugin that recently stopped working. It still appears under resources in the Chrome Dev Tools, but I get a console error that it is not a function. If I copy and past the script into the console it works.
[10:19:18] <jop008> decx you were right
[10:19:43] <Xatenev> noahmg123: sounds like ur missing some on document ready
[10:19:46] <Xatenev> or something like that
[10:19:57] <repxxl> how to make ajax to run every xx secs
[10:19:58] <Xatenev> like, ur calling the function too early in ur code
[10:20:05] <Xatenev> repxxl: set interval?
[10:20:32] <Xatenev> repxxl: like setInterval(function() { /* AJAX HERE */ }, xx);
[10:20:34] <noahmg123> Xatenev: the strange thing is that it stopped working yesterday and it had worked the day before.
[10:20:40] <Xatenev> noahmg123: can u show me?Ü
[10:21:26] <noahmg123> Xatenev: I'll take a look first. This project is big so I don't want to go sharing large sections of my code around.
[10:21:33] <noahmg123> If I can avoid it.

[11:01:39] <_blizzy_> ok, let me make it.
[11:03:09] <Siegel> http://jsfiddle.net/fD62H/1/
[11:03:15] <_blizzy_> taplar, it's kind of hard to recreate this, as I'm posting to a url.
[11:03:43] <taplar> i'm just wanting to see the javascript that your trying
[11:04:26] <_blizzy_> https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/2787fc3851cca6d48f00
[11:04:49] <taplar> which one
[11:04:57] <_blizzy_> the unfollow one
[11:04:59] <taplar> k
[11:05:21] <_blizzy_> actually, it's both. I can unfollow fine, but it posts to the old url when I try to follow.
[11:05:23] <_blizzy_> same viseversa.
[11:05:38] <_blizzy_> when it should be posting to the 'follow' url, and vise versa.
[11:06:03] <LindsayMac> Having a hard time finding an element in the DOM tree here. The idea is when you click the red box it updates the container .theuser with some text http://jsfiddle.net/j5dz57d9/1/
[11:06:40] <LindsayMac> its odd beause it seems to return the selector .theuser but its not adding the text
[11:06:53] <Siegel> trying to set textarea caret to drop position, anyone have any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/fD62H/1/
[11:07:49] <taplar> _blizzy_: well one thing your changing the ids and classes in the callbacks
[11:08:02] <taplar> i'm assuming your expecting those to now work with the callbacks, but that's not true
[11:08:12] <taplar> binding on a class directly is not a future proof thing
[11:08:19] <taplar> it only binds to what it matches on at that given time
[11:08:34] <taplar> if you want to future proof it you need to delegate bind on a parent element
[11:08:52] <_blizzy_> what do you mean by delegating bind on a parent element?
[11:09:15] <taplar> $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, callback)
[11:09:34] <taplar> what that does is lets the events bubble up from the children to the parent
[11:09:43] <taplar> and then it evaluates if the child was the childSelector
[11:09:48] <taplar> if it is, it processes
[11:10:02] <taplar> so if at any time new children are added, or changed, to match that childSelector, it will still work
[11:11:42] <Siegel> should a custom click event set to the position over a textare not focus it and set the caret position?
[11:12:16] <taplar> Siegel: if you click in a textarea it typically will focus that element and place the cursor where you clicked.  provided the text has reached that point
[11:12:19] <_blizzy_> oh ok, thanks, taplar.
[11:13:03] <taplar> _blizzy_: the important thing of that to remember is that you are not binding to a class
[11:13:11] <taplar> you are using a selector to filter what element to bind on
[11:13:12] <Siegel> taplar: its works with user click but not with a javascript generated click event
[11:13:47] <_blizzy_> taplar, ok, thanks.
[11:13:48] <taplar> Siegel: right, because your invoking the callback, not the other logic the browser does to manipulate the ui
[11:14:16] <taplar> Siegel: if you want to place the cursor in a textarea you'll have to change one of it's properties, hold on
[11:15:13] <taplar> Siegel: selectionStart
[11:16:14] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/j5dz57d9/1/ <~~ if anyone has thoughts on why I can't seem to add text to a child of a sibling, would be HUGELY appreciated
[11:16:20] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement
[11:16:24] <enerel> hi  i am looking for decent mobile framework what is your opinion on Ionic framework?
[11:17:05] <Siegel> taplar: im guessing there is no simple way to convert cursor position to the equavalent selectionStart position?
[11:17:17] <taplar> LindsayMac: 'Caption' is capitalized in your html, but not your selector
[11:17:29] <taplar> Siegel: not really
[11:19:37] <LindsayMac> taplar:  still doesnt work (my bad) http://jsfiddle.net/j5dz57d9/2/
[11:19:42] <Siegel> taplar: awe that sucks was hoping that was not the case, thanks though
[11:20:21] <taplar> Siegel: you can still set focus() though, so they can immediately start typing if you want
[11:21:00] <Siegel> taplar: i want to drag and drop text to where the cursor is in the text area
[11:21:32] <LindsayMac> Siegel:  as soon as you click off wouldn't that be the issue?
[11:21:54] <LindsayMac> Siegel:  unless I suppose you record the initial location of the cursor drop and send the character count to the 'drop' location?
[11:22:00] <enerel> anyone give me your opinion on Ionic framework
[11:22:07] <LindsayMac> enerel:  done have one
[11:22:48] <enerel> LindsayMac what?
[11:22:58] <LindsayMac> enerel:  dont have one. sorry
[11:23:04] <Siegel> LindsayMac: yeah but that requires knowledge of either character widths or fixed character font and then the calculations to figure out the drop posiitons
[11:23:22] <LindsayMac> Siegel:  what are you dragging? not more text?
[11:24:29] <Siegel> a jquery ui draggable
[11:24:33] <LindsayMac> Siegel:  i would imagine the character count is the same no matter the size of the character.. you want to basically insert some content after X chars inside of you textarea
[11:25:10] <Siegel> yeah but X chars is dependent on cursor position when dropped
[11:25:16] <taplar> LindsayMac: i believe it is having an issue with the id being purely numeric
[11:25:30] <LindsayMac> taplar:  wow really?
[11:25:43] <ansikt> Hey guys!  Is there a good way to tell how many copies of jQuery are loaded on my page?
[11:25:49] <taplar> or not, wth
[11:25:56] <LindsayMac> ansikt:  look in the page source
[11:26:11] <LindsayMac> taplar:  it seems like it's getting the actual selector though in the console log
[11:26:27] <ansikt> LindsayMac: The problem is that most of them are being loaded via advertising networks, and not by me.
[11:26:28] <taplar> lmao
[11:26:35] <ansikt> If it was up to me, there'd just be the one copy :P
[11:26:43] <taplar> LindsayMac: your id selector has the last 2 digits transposed
[11:27:03] <taplar> :)
[11:27:07] <LindsayMac> taplar:  say what now?
[11:27:17] <taplar> <a href="#" id="8394"
[11:27:24] <taplar> jQuery('a#8349')
[11:27:31] <LindsayMac> omg
[11:27:36] <LindsayMac> wtf is wrong with me....
[11:27:52] <ansikt> Breaking on caught exceptions got me to 5 copies, because jQuery uses try-catch for some feature-testing stuff
[11:28:18] <LindsayMac> Tadas:  going to test this within my actual code now
[11:28:34] <ansikt> I was more wondering if there was some nice part of no-conflict I could use to determine
[11:29:09] <taplar> no conflict just releases the $ from  being jQuery
[11:30:20] <ansikt> @taplar, it does a little more than that.  It also removes the 'jQuery' global
[11:30:39] <taplar> uh
[11:31:16] <taplar> then how would you use it later?
[11:31:23] <ansikt> You get to rename it
[11:31:47] <taplar> ah, htat's an option
[11:31:50] <taplar> *that
[11:32:11] <taplar> not required though it seems
[11:34:42] <enerel> what os the best Mobile Framework you suggest?
[11:35:56] <taplar> enerel: you might try #frontend
[11:36:05] <enerel> ok
[11:36:12] <enerel> thanks
[11:36:29] <noahmg123> I have a jQuery plugin that recently stopped working. It still appears under resources in the Chrome Dev Tools, but I get a console error that it is not a function. If I copy and past the script into the console it then works.
[11:36:45] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 are you loading jquery more than once?
[11:36:45] <enerel> no one there Taplar
[11:36:53] <taplar> :(
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> enerel what was your question?
[11:37:15] <enerel> what is the best Mobile Framework you suggest?
[11:37:38] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I don't believe so.... wait. Let me check something.
[11:37:47] <enerel> everyone suggest ionic but i dont wanna learn angular or should i?
[11:38:05] <robertmaxrees> enerel "mobile framework" fooor...?
[11:38:19] <enerel> creating mobile UI
[11:38:24] <enerel> like jquery mobile
[11:38:32] <robertmaxrees> right, so what kind of site are you making?
[11:38:50] <enerel> simple movie theatre timetable
[11:38:56] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: Yep. I was using the TamperMonkey (GreaseMonkey for Chrome) plugin to load jQuery for use in another project. (facepalm)
[11:39:28] <robertmaxrees> enerel you don't need an entire framework for that.
[11:40:03] <enerel> jist JS and phonegap?
[11:40:15] <robertmaxrees> enerel you want to build an app or a site?
[11:40:24] <enerel> just app no site
[11:40:41] <robertmaxrees> oh, this is totally the wrong place to be asking lol
[11:40:54] <enerel> but using js
[11:41:00] <robertmaxrees> still the wrong place.
[11:41:08] <enerel> i see
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> you could hit up ##javascript - they might have some ideas.
[11:44:21] <Tadas> LindsayMac: u w0t m8
[11:44:37] <LindsayMac> uhh wut?
[11:44:54] <Tadas> 16:28:16 <LindsayMac> Tadas:  going to test this within my actual code now
[11:44:56] <Tadas> ;_;
[11:45:18] <LindsayMac> no clarification was given just there
[11:45:19] <tuskkk___> this method is being called 1033 times, its working in chrome but gives the stop script popup in ff, how do I stop that? https://bpaste.net/show/fb8322438fb5
[11:46:06] <robertmaxrees> why are you calling it 1033 times?
[11:47:43] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: some pre written code by previous developers, my task here is to clean it :(
[11:47:53] <NoiseEee> 1032 was just not quite enough
[11:48:06] <tuskkk___> its been put into numerous $.each and all
[11:48:12] <NoiseEee> tuskkk___: clean it involves not calling it 1033 times
[11:48:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:48:29] <tuskkk___> OK, so how do I tackle it? i.e where do I start?
[11:48:41] <robertmaxrees> what does it fire on?
[11:48:53] <tuskkk___> another method
[11:49:02] <tuskkk___> wait, I will try and show you the code.
[11:49:08] <robertmaxrees> window resize ooor...?
[11:50:22] <nsanden> If I have a dom like <textarea /><div /><span /> and I want to click on textarea and from there (e.target) find the closest span, im using e.target.next().find('span') and this works - id like the code to be more flexible though. for example if my dom is <textarea /><span /> id like it to work for that as well
[11:51:51] <_blizzy_> sorry that I already posted this, but I can't figure out why this is posting to the wrong url. https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/34f2d44254f18f2858cb
[11:52:05] <robertmaxrees> nsanden show us the context.
[11:52:28] <tuskkk___> NoiseEee, robertmaxrees https://bpaste.net/show/4f065693dbe0
[11:52:31] <robertmaxrees> _blizzy_ why what is?  there are three posts in there.
[11:52:43] <robertmaxrees> hey so tuskkk___ we're not going to read thousands of lines.
[11:52:50] <robertmaxrees> err, almost 1,000 lines hahaha
[11:52:54] <taplar> _blizzy_: i already gave you a pointer on that
[11:53:41] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: sorry, #634
[11:53:45] <taplar> your statically binding on elements, they will always do what you bound them to do
[11:53:48] <robertmaxrees> nsanden some context for your code is important.
[11:53:51] <taplar> regardless of changing their class/id later on
[11:54:07] <tuskkk___> or wait, let me isolate the calls.
[11:54:16] <robertmaxrees> tuskkk___ could you just answer my question earlier?
[11:54:19] <NoiseEee> tuskkk___: at the very least, start looking for "resizeTags()" in that code, i can see it called in quite a few places
[11:54:21] <robertmaxrees> about how the resize call is fired?
[11:54:24] <nsanden> robertmaxrees: ill make a fiddle
[11:54:40] <_blizzy_> taplar, oh. robertmaxrees, the follow one. x:
[11:54:52] <taplar> -_-
[11:55:01] <robertmaxrees> _blizzy_ sounds like taplar has you covered.
[11:55:10] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're changing classes and expecting the event bindings to still work.
[11:55:25] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: its fire by setupTags, which is initialized
[11:55:27] <JuzE> Hello, I have a question. I try to build a "WebUI" with JQueryUI, Javascript and PHP. I have a barcodereader with a socket to the js for events. Now it it possible, that I call "document.getElementById('button').click();" for example in the JS-File and the Button is connected to JQuery "$( "#button" ).click(function()". That works fine, but I don't want to use the button, is it possible to trigger an JQueryUI-function with JS command in
[11:55:56] <_blizzy_> sorry, taplar. ._. I got it now.
[11:56:04] <robertmaxrees> JuzE that cut off
[11:56:23] <robertmaxrees> JuzE are you asking how to fire a function from, say, multiple event listeners?
[11:56:35] <robertmaxrees> or an event listener and manually elsehwere?
[11:57:59] <JuzE> I don't need a manually event, only the one fired from javascript. (If it's a working way, I'm really new on it)
[11:58:05] <tuskkk___> NoiseEee: yes, I think the place it breaks is where its being called in .each
[11:58:09] <NoiseEee> tuskkk___: really, what you should do is use the console to break on the first line of the function, then look at the stack trace and see what's calling it (1000+ times)
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> JuzE you can name the function and call it/pass it to the event handler.
[11:58:26] <NoiseEee> tuskkk___: there you go, take it out of there for starters
[11:58:47] <tuskkk___> yep, tried commenting it, script ran good.
[11:59:00] <boobsbr> howdy
[11:59:12] <tuskkk___> but then, these people need that functionality.
[11:59:26] <robertmaxrees> JuzE so https://bpaste.net/show/8d951e2d49e2
[11:59:28] <boobsbr> I'm trying to figure out why using select2 4.0 on one of my pages makes it very wide, with a bunch of blank space on the right
[11:59:37] <boobsbr> I tried using a chrome plug-in put a box around every element on the page, but still, the empty space added to the right seems to be part of the <html> node
[11:59:56] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball for boobsbr
[12:00:03] <robertmaxrees> hrmm.  i can't see your site.  weird.
[12:00:40] <taplar> ohh, is that the new iCrystal?
[12:00:53] <boobsbr> robertmaxrees: does a screenshot suffice? can't put the code on public pastebin
[12:01:07] <robertmaxrees> boobsbr not really.
[12:01:21] <robertmaxrees> you already described the issue - no way for us to troubleshoot with a screenshot.
[12:01:50] <boobsbr> ok, so is there another tool to help me investigate the page, besides Pesticide for Chrome?
[12:01:59] <robertmaxrees> your developer tools.
[12:02:04] <JuzE> robertmaxrees I will try something, brb
[12:03:10] <robertmaxrees> boobsbr your browser has an inspector built in to deal with this kind of stuff.
[12:03:58] <boobsbr> yeah, I tried using the element inspector, tried highlighting the empty space, but only the <body> gets highlighted
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to figure out by traversing what's causing that.
[12:04:30] <nsanden> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/o5or6p97/1/ - again i want to basically just get a hold of the closest span to whatever textarea im clicking in. the context is: each span will display the number of characters that comes from the textarea above it
[12:09:07] <taplar> nsanden: probably would be better to put the pairs in a shared parent
[12:09:32] <taplar> your relying pretty heavily on positions
[12:09:52] <nsanden> taplar: yes id like to not rely so much on position
[12:10:06] <robertmaxrees> and back.
[12:10:18] <robertmaxrees> nsanden yeah, use semantic markup broseph.
[12:10:19] <nsanden> what do you mean by "pairs in a shared parent"
[12:10:24] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[12:12:21] <JuzE> http://pastebin.com/WE3JVWuH <-- This is my <script> in the PHP-File. And now I want to get the buttonclick away, so that I can delete the button and fire the event with a call in .js ; Don't understand your snippet @ robertmaxrees
[12:13:12] <robertmaxrees> nsanden http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o5or6p97/2/
[12:13:34] <robertmaxrees> JuzE err.
[12:13:50] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> easyt.
[12:14:41] <nsanden> ohh i like that
[12:14:44] <nsanden> clever
[12:14:49] <nsanden> thanks
[12:15:04] <robertmaxrees> JuzE https://bpaste.net/show/12204a6b040d
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> JuzE you just pull that code into a function.  like i said.
[12:18:38] <JuzE> Yes I understood, but what is the command for start the function from .js File?
[12:18:50] <robertmaxrees> myFunction();
[12:20:37] <JuzE> Tried this few times, it dont work..
[12:20:47] <robertmaxrees> it's unemployed?
[12:20:57] <robertmaxrees> oor....?  maybe show us in a simple jsfiddle what you're trying to do.
[12:21:01] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:21:16] <taplar_lunch> i love this room
[12:21:47] <JuzE> Ok I will try to make a fiddle with it
[12:25:52] <JuzE> https://jsfiddle.net/h9fv8ngL/
[12:26:42] <JuzE> If you click on the "Next Effect" Button you will see what I want to have, but I don't want to have this button there
[12:27:33] <robertmaxrees> what do you want instead?
[12:28:01] <JuzE> To "simulate" the event without any button
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> also, you have nexted document ready statements in there.
[12:28:10] <robertmaxrees> right, so you just want the code to run?
[12:28:26] <robertmaxrees> the code in myFunction?
[12:29:47] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating "event" with "handler"
[12:31:40] <JuzE> possible.. I think there should be an solution to get this function "myFunction" started, when I write something in a javascript file
[12:32:40] <taplar_lunch> why not just invoke it?
[12:32:43] <JuzE> The button was only there for tests but it was possible to mark the button as checked from the javascript in the background, so I thought there will be a way to do this without the button.
[12:32:54] <robertmaxrees> there is...
[12:32:56] <robertmaxrees> just run the code...
[12:33:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9fv8ngL/1/
[12:34:50] <JuzE> I think we talk at cross purposes :/ I will try to give you better information about this, moment
[12:35:04] <robertmaxrees> you're being really vague.
[12:35:49] <JuzE> Sorry, bad english :> I try to explain another way
[12:35:54] <robertmaxrees> and btw - $(function(){ and $(document).ready(function() { are the same thing.
[12:37:40] <robertmaxrees> so your current fiddle is doing this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9fv8ngL/4/
[12:37:57] <badcss> 12/F/CA any1 want to cyber????
[12:38:01] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> not cool
[12:38:06] <badcss> lol
[12:38:11] <badcss> ITS A TRAP!
[12:38:11] <robertmaxrees> not really all that funny, but okay.
[12:38:28] <robertmaxrees> JuzE it looks like you want to have things fade in and out and back in, right?
[12:38:40] <badcss> unless you were planning on PMing me dick pics, lighten up
[12:39:58] <JuzE> http://pastebin.com/vaPzSqyp <-- This is my javascript file in the background. It is a connection between the js and a python script. In Line 24 I tried a workaround with a button click. I wan't the same without the button -> starting the function from the fiddle with a command in this script on pastebin
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> which function?
[12:41:03] <taplar_lunch> there's an element with an id of 'button'?
[12:41:49] <JuzE> When I start the page, it will show the "#header" and the "#auth". When the socketserver gets the message to change, it should hide the #auth and display the #user
[12:42:15] <robertmaxrees> JuzE then yeah, what i showed you is what you want.
[12:42:29] <JuzE> @ taplar_lunch, at this time there is a button, but I wan't to delete the button and do the same without
[12:42:59] <taplar_lunch> i was mainly commenting about the naming convention
[12:43:11] <taplar_lunch> but what robert said earlier still stands.  just call the function
[12:44:11] <robertmaxrees> JuzE you just put the code you want in a function, then call the function.
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> it's that simple.
[12:45:03] <VectorX> is there an event when you come to a back using the back button ?
[12:45:10] <robertmaxrees> VectorX in some browsers, yes.
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> well, kind of.
[12:45:22] <nsanden> robertmaxrees: any other way you can think of to implement http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o5or6p97/2/ (other than wrapping the groups up) - this will be a chrome extension that runs on any web page so it may be difficult for me to inject wrappers into dom at right places as apposed to a website i control the dom
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> is it a full pageload, or are you using pushstates?
[12:45:36] <VectorX> i got a select that retains its value on back, i need it to reset to default
[12:45:44] <robertmaxrees> nsanden err, give us a more indicative example.
[12:46:34] <robertmaxrees> VectorX then you need to look at the pageshow event and window load handler
[12:48:14] <VectorX> is that like for mobile and desktop browsers ?
[12:48:27] <robertmaxrees> VectorX https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pageshow
[12:48:48] <robertmaxrees> not wide browser support for the event, but the window load should fill in those gaps.
[12:49:12] <JuzE> Robertmaxrees, than I don't know why it don't work at me :(
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> see any errors?
[12:49:30] <robertmaxrees> alsO: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:49:34] <VectorX> robertmaxrees how about reseting it on unload event ?
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> VectorX you set the value to an empty string.
[12:51:22] <gadlol> Hello
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[12:51:53] <gadlol> Is it possible to get the value of a jquery ui slider using plain javascript?
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> why?  you have jquery ui and jquery already.
[12:52:40] <gadlol> yes i know but i want to grab from function that no jquery is allowed
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> as far as I know, you'll need to use jquery in some capacity.
[12:53:49] <gadlol> a way is to store the value to a hidden input and then retreive that,
[12:53:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:54:24] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/ hook into the events and go to town.
[12:54:39] <JuzE> But don't I need to call the function other way? I call the "myFunction()" in another JS-File, so I think I need another command for it..
[12:54:51] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[12:54:59] <robertmaxrees> JuzE you're running into scope problems.
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to define the function globally.
[12:55:16] <robertmaxrees> or consolodate your logic into one place.
[12:56:17] <gadlol> Why not using plain javascript to get and set values to jquery ui in general? It would be nice if we had that feature.
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> gadlol err, because jquery ui exposes an API for those things.  that's how that works.  if you have the slider, you have the library loaded already so why would you need a plain JS api?
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k3tj8d0v/ - JuzE notice how the variable doesn't exist outside
[12:57:12] <robertmaxrees> *outside that function?
[12:58:00] <gadlol> sometimes you are not allowed to use jquery although you are using it for gui stuff (jquery ui)
[12:58:14] <JuzE> Okay I understand. And there is no comannd like "document.getElementById('button').click();" which works from outside?
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> JuzE that's a really back solution to your problem.
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> proxying logic through the DOM is not a good idea.
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> gadlol that makes no sense.
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> you're allowed to use it, but you're not allowed to use it?
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> if you need to get values out of it, just use it.  the library is already loaded.  i can't think of a place where anything else makes sense.
[12:59:58] <gadlol> Hmmm ok I will see what i am gonna do
[13:00:15] <robertmaxrees> is your employer telling you to not use jquery ui to get the values back out?
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> because if so, that's nuts.
[13:00:26] <JuzE> Then I don't know how to do something I want.. damn
[13:00:41] <robertmaxrees> JuzE just define the function outside of the document ready.
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> JuzE or consolodate things - what is it you're trying to do anyway?  why split things up like that?
[13:01:31] <JuzE> omg?!
[13:01:38] <JuzE> We are talking 30 minutes for this solution?
[13:01:49] <robertmaxrees> ... i said that a while ago.
[13:02:04] <JuzE> okay sorry, didn't understand :P
[13:02:19] <robertmaxrees> you're having issues understanding scope.
[13:02:24] <robertmaxrees> but why split the files up like that?
[13:02:38] <JuzE> I have to split this, because the one is the website the other one is the socketserver with socketclient in another language
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> slow waaaay down.
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> we're talking about your frontend JS.
[13:03:32] <JuzE> Ah okay, and where I splitted this?
[13:03:52] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to call a function in your backend from code in your frontend?
[13:04:13] <JuzE> yes, bidirectional
[13:04:53] <robertmaxrees> what are you using for sockets?
[13:04:54] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> because i think you're conflating how this works.
[13:05:56] <robertmaxrees> JuzE you can't juse call functions on your server like they're in the browser.
[13:07:10] <Azrael_-> is it possible to get the source of an change-event? every example i find is just .change(function() { ... } );
[13:07:30] <taplar> 'this' or e.target?
[13:07:43] <taplar> need to pass in 'e' though to use it
[13:07:56] <boobsbr> robertmaxrees: I managed to figure it out by manually disabling CSS rules. turns out setting the with for all <select> elements to 100% was affecting Select2
[13:07:59] <Azrael_-> k, i was just surprised as i didn't see an example for this
[13:08:02] <Azrael_-> thanks
[13:08:14] <JuzE> robertmaxrees I will try it what I want to do, this work is now good for me for calling functions
[13:08:17] <taplar> you don't have to pass in 'e' to use 'this' fwiw
[13:10:11] <robertmaxrees> boobsbr hah sounds about right.
[13:10:35] <robertmaxrees> JuzE i still think you're confused about how this works, but okay :)
[13:10:55] <JuzE> yes I am :P
[13:11:00] <taplar> ^ i'm not sure how the button click was working
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar they're conflating server-side calls with handlers and things.
[13:11:34] <taplar> oh, so it wasn't working.  it was an attempt
[13:11:38] <robertmaxrees> it was.
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> the original fiddles worked.
[13:11:50] <robertmaxrees> but they weren't indicative of what they really wanted to know.
[13:11:55] <taplar> ah
[13:23:24] <Musk> i just noticed something weird i have an element that i call .show() in Chrome it does a Display: block (what i want) but in FireFox it does a Display: inline.
[13:23:37] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[13:23:58] <Musk> v2.1.4
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah... the hide and show methods are... weird.
[13:24:51] <Musk> the reasoning seems logical though since its an anchor.. but weird that FF vs Chrome would interpret it that way.
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> default styles, cascades, browser quirks...
[13:25:13] <Musk> yeh
[13:25:54] <Musk> sad i can't do something like .show({'display':'block'});
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with .css() ;)
[13:26:24] <robertmaxrees> or do what I do - addClass() and removeClass()
[13:26:33] <Musk> true... its just one of those moment when u want a 1 class to rule them all.
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> "1 class"?
[13:27:18] <Musk> yeah basicly i use this 1 class which i just toggle visibility one and it manipulate all sorts of elements on the page.
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> you mean like a css class?  because you can have that - .hide.
[13:27:33] <robertmaxrees> that's why a lot of people make a utility .hide class
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> and add/remove it.
[13:39:17] <VectorX> in a ul/li/a menu i want to find the a with a certain word, how do i do that
[13:39:20] <VectorX> select
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> you... don't?
[13:39:44] <VectorX> i must
[13:39:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> that's a bummer.
[13:40:12] <robertmaxrees> you could render the word somewhere else and measure that, but i'm not aware of any method to get the width of a word.
[13:40:37] <VectorX> sorry
[13:40:52] <VectorX> i need to get the <a> matching a word
[13:41:06] <VectorX> <a>me</a> so the a that has me
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:41:15] <VectorX> my bad for the typo in the question
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> there's a contains selector, but i'd use .filter() instead of at all possible.
[13:41:27] <robertmaxrees> contains is slow.
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> and hard to read imo.
[13:41:55] <VectorX> ok
[13:44:55] <Azrael_-> is the behaviour defined if you compare non-numeric data (text/objects) with numbers, like 'a'<0 ?
[13:45:07] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid doing that, though.
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> becuase it's an ephemeral concept./
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> that falls under the family of though of "type coercion"
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> err, family of rules of
[13:45:47] <Azrael_-> ok, then i'll stay with if($.isNumeric(testfield) && testfield > 0)
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> how could testfield not be numeric?
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> is it coming from an input on the page?
[13:46:22] <Azrael_-> yeah
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> then pass it to parseFloat()/parseInt() first.
[13:46:48] <robertmaxrees> you can literally just do if (parseFloat(testfield)) { }
[13:47:57] <Azrael_-> but var f = parseInt("40 years") <-- this also seems to be valid and that's not what i desire
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> then the input needs constraints around what it'll accept.
[13:48:25] <robertmaxrees> you can also parse that string to just get the number,
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd do both, since testfield > 0 is something i'd avoid if testfield is a string.
[13:49:02] <Azrael_-> ok, thanks
[13:54:57] <tuskkk___> in this piece, how to call resizeTags (#26) such that the script remains responsive, https://bpaste.net/show/d2b9b2da1482
[13:55:46] <socialblogsite> What does the following mean?  '@':images[i] (jQuery)      An extension for Chrome gives me that as example in an input field called “JS code”, for me to generate new filenames for bulk downloaded files (poor documentation - chinese programmer)
[13:56:29] <robertmaxrees> tuskkk___ do what now?
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> you mean call it when the window resizes ooor...?
[13:57:07] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: no, just call it asynchronously in the background.
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you mean by that.
[13:57:37] <robertmaxrees> is resizeTags an async function ooor...?  what are you trying to accomplishf?
[13:57:50] <tuskkk___> like, this call is the one that freezes the page, I want its computation to be done in the background and not all at once.
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[13:58:03] <tuskkk___> oh
[13:58:11] <tuskkk___> why?
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> because DOM operations aren't async.
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> what is this code actually trying to accomplish?>
[13:59:43] <robertmaxrees> because this is really inefficient.
[13:59:53] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: there are various tags on a video, say they were saved for a resolution of 400*400, now if the screen size is 800*800, they change it to that.
[14:00:10] <robertmaxrees> so you want to resize a video?
[14:00:36] <tuskkk___> no, the tags on a video, you remember like to ads we see on youtube videos, they are similar.
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> oh, ads.
[14:01:09] <robertmaxrees> so you want to resize some elements?
[14:01:12] <tuskkk___> yes
[14:01:14] <robertmaxrees> why is that happened thousands of times?
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> *happening
[14:01:55] <robertmaxrees> is it bound to the window resize event or something?
[14:02:05] <tuskkk___> each tag has a matrix of positions, its getting all those as objects, then foreach of them it computer a new size matrix, and then it resizes for each matrix value.
[14:02:16] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:02:30] <robertmaxrees> i feel like this is overcomplicating something.  why would this happen over 1,000 times?
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> are there thousands of videos?
[14:02:55] <tuskkk___> no, there are 300~ so tags
[14:03:02] <tuskkk___> over 4 minutes video
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:03:19] <tuskkk___> and the page freezes for such high number of tags only.
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> so the first BIG thing is $('#' + tagId) happens a few times.
[14:03:54] <robertmaxrees> do that selection beforehand and store it in a var.
[14:04:25] <robertmaxrees> give those elements a class, select that, and then do a single .filter() or .is() call to get the particular one you want.
[14:06:34] <tuskkk___> I didn't get the second point, give #tagId a class?
[14:06:55] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/0a6a738a6fea
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> instead of selecting via #tagId, you need to filter the set down
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're running $() a bunch of times, which is WAY expensive.
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> also, you run self.resizeTags(); twice.  just run it once after that if statement.
[14:08:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to do a major rewrite of this.
[14:10:26] <tuskkk___> you mean after, if(isFullScreen = 1) { resize?
[14:10:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> why run it twice?
[14:11:02] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd learn how to use your dev tool's profiling feature.
[14:11:09] <tuskkk___> don't know what they have accomplished there.
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> see what's really slowing you down.
[14:11:37] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to learn.  there is no "silver bullet" here - the script itself is flawed on some basic levels.
[14:11:52] <tuskkk___> tried that, couldn't figure out how to set breakpoints and get it working.
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> profiling, not debugging
[14:12:14] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com has some good info on debugging fwiw.
[14:13:10] <tuskkk___> ok, any tips on this method? https://bpaste.net/show/be33003f80f2
[14:13:42] <robertmaxrees> store $('.me-tag') outside of anything that's going to get ruyn a whole bunch.
[14:13:47] <robertmaxrees> and then reference the variable.
[14:14:08] <tuskkk___> ok
[14:14:12] <robertmaxrees> it really looks like this really just needs some CSS love.
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> since this all looks like it needs breakpoints.
[14:14:42] <tuskkk___> not getting you there
[14:14:57] <robertmaxrees> so said this is all setup to resize elements based on what, screen size?
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> video size
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:15:16] <tuskkk___> screen size
[14:15:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's responsive design.
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> probably no JS needed.
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> we've solved these problems already :)
[14:15:36] <tuskkk___> oh
[14:15:44] <taplar> tagContainer[0] is weird
[14:15:52] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/ tuskkk___
[14:16:33] <tuskkk___> they have this very old site, they started porting to bootstrap now
[14:16:48] <robertmaxrees> this needs to be apart of that port.
[14:16:57] <robertmaxrees> literally all of your work will be wasted otherwise.
[14:16:58] <tuskkk___> btw, how do you recognize its not bootstrap?
[14:17:12] <robertmaxrees> because the js is trying to do what the bootstrap will do for you.
[14:17:47] <tuskkk___> what do you mean by "this needs to be apart of that port."
[14:18:14] <robertmaxrees> you said "they have this very old site, they started porting to bootstrap now" - i'm saying that this whole project you're working on needs to be apart of that effort.
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> like, it needs to be done with bootstrap, not with fixing some js.
[14:19:02] <tuskkk___> right! So if I rewrite this video page with bootstrap they won't need this resizeTags js?
[14:19:22] <robertmaxrees> probably not.  if all this is doing is resizing elements based on screen sizes...
[14:19:39] <robertmaxrees> that's what bootstrap does for you.
[14:19:58] <tuskkk___> then? what is the solution to get out of this mess?
[14:20:09] <robertmaxrees> i just old you.
[14:20:15] <robertmaxrees> use bootstrap.
[14:20:17] <robertmaxrees> *told
[14:20:28] <tuskkk___> yes, but on which page?
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[14:20:39] <robertmaxrees> the page you're working on.
[14:21:14] <tuskkk___> sorry, like rebuild the page using bootstrap's container, cols etc?
[14:21:20] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:21:31] <robertmaxrees> media queries and all of that, too.
[14:22:42] <tuskkk___> alright, let me do all the changes you suggested then see what happens. Thanks a lot robertmaxrees.
[14:23:03] <robertmaxrees> it's very unlikely those will have much meaningful impact fwiw.
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> does this code run when the window resizes?
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> or just when it loads?
[14:23:30] <tuskkk___> oh :( its runs when the page loads
[14:23:36] <tuskkk___> all at once!
[14:23:46] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, there's not much guarantee that it'll help much.  it might.
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd skip to just doing the rewrite with bootstrap.
[14:25:08] <tuskkk___> but I am a bit confused on that too, they render the video from a controller action which generates it in an iframe
[14:25:25] <robertmaxrees> so figure it out.
[14:25:30] <tuskkk___> so, should I just add bootstrap classes to the iFrame view?
[14:25:39] <tuskkk___> like put it in a container for instance...?
[14:25:40] <robertmaxrees> rebuild the whole page using bootstrap classes.
[14:28:26] <NoiseEee> rewrite it!
[14:28:41] <NoiseEee> dont put bandages on top of bandages covering wounds that you don't even understand
[14:28:53] <NoiseEee> if you're being paid to do it right/clean, do it right
[14:28:57] <NoiseEee> learn in the process
[14:28:58] <NoiseEee> up the game
[14:29:01] <NoiseEee> dream big
[14:29:04] <NoiseEee> reach for the stars
[14:29:18] <NoiseEee> dance like no-one is watching
[14:29:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:29:35] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee++
[14:29:45] <NoiseEee> friday:|
[14:29:55] <robertmaxrees> whaaaat b-ot does karma now?!
[14:30:46] <NoiseEee> i don't think so?
[14:30:49] <NoiseEee> did you get a notification?
[14:30:52] <robertmaxrees> it just PMed me.
[14:30:55] <NoiseEee> weird
[14:30:58] <NoiseEee> private karma
[14:30:59] <robertmaxrees> neat
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> haha quiet karma
[14:32:25] <robertmaxrees> i usually hate that "rewrite it" type response, but this is one of those cases where the bandaids are going to be almost unreadable.
[14:33:22] <NoiseEee> yeah
[15:10:38] <bdmc> Hi all.  Has anybody used Radio Buttons with jQuery.serialize()?  I am getting all of the other <input> elements, but not Radio Buttons in my POST values.
[15:11:06] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[15:12:23] <bdmc> Not easily.  I could probably pastebin some of the code from the form.  What would you like?
[15:12:29] <muranjan> How can I show an image in a TD on mouseover clicking that will appear a drop down in the same TD
[15:12:42] <robertmaxrees> bdmc i'm curious of your markup is valid.
[15:13:00] <robertmaxrees> muranjan bind a mouseenter listener and click listener
[15:13:15] <bdmc> robertmaxrees: OK.  No problem.  Let me show you a text input and a radio button.
[15:13:42] <muranjan> robertmazrees: can you please give some more details
[15:13:47] <robertmaxrees> muranjan on what?
[15:13:58] <muranjan> bind a mouseenter listener and click listener
[15:14:04] <muranjan> robertmazrees:
[15:14:18] <robertmaxrees> muranjan not sure how i can expand that more - you need to bind some event listeners.
[15:14:27] <robertmaxrees> do you not know how to do that?
[15:15:04] <robertmaxrees> bdmc because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4u9y10t6/
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> words fine here.
[15:15:14] <muranjan> robertmazrees: Nope
[15:15:32] <robertmaxrees> muranjan https://learn.jquery.com/
[15:15:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd give this a run through.
[15:15:48] <robertmaxrees> you'll need everything up through the "events" section.
[15:16:07] <robhol> so, as a guy who doesn't do a lot of frontend dev - do people still use noscript tags etc? :p
[15:16:21] <robertmaxrees> robhol depends.  not usually.
[15:16:25] <robhol> ie for doing... something... when the client for some reason doesn't support JS
[15:16:45] <robertmaxrees> robhol sure.  people will display alternative content, but most clients support JS.
[15:17:03] <robhol> yeah. Some people use NoScript etc as a general rule though
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> robhol lol it's not enough to worry about it.
[15:17:31] <robertmaxrees> it's unreasonable today for most people to have JS off as a default.
[15:17:38] <berpcor|3> Hello.
[15:17:45] <robhol> if people worry about IE7, I don't feel too neurotic about worrying about NoScript (¬u¬)
[15:17:59] <robhol> but point taken. :)
[15:18:00] <robertmaxrees> robhol very few people support IE7 any more.
[15:18:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can reasonably expect that people have it on - feel free to display a message saying they need to enable it.
[15:18:24] <robertmaxrees> hell, most people don't support IE8 and IE9 is slowly dying, too.
[15:18:31] <robhol> good.
[15:18:44] <robertmaxrees> my company has to support IE8, but most JS works fine in that.
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> get es5-shim if needed.  html5shiv, too.
[15:19:04] <robhol> btw, is there a decent way to find out if my site has compatibility problems?
[15:19:08] <berpcor|3> http://pastebin.com/xwLwUmLK
[15:19:14] <robhol> short of actually testing everything I mean
[15:19:17] <berpcor|3> init() is always executed.
[15:19:19] <berpcor|3> Why?
[15:19:32] <robertmaxrees> robhol test it.
[15:19:34] <robhol> Because I already ran into one issue, with string.startsWith not being supported in Safari or whatever
[15:19:39] <berpcor|3> I need it to be executed only when span exists on the page.
[15:19:46] <robertmaxrees> robhol and don't try to use the new and shiny all the time.
[15:20:01] <berpcor|3> Can anyone explain why it is happens so.
[15:20:04] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|3 because the length is greather than 1
[15:20:09] <robhol> I can't really stomach JS without the new and shiny ;p
[15:20:10] <robertmaxrees> err, greater than 0
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> robhol then you have bigger problems to solve.
[15:20:29] <berpcor|3> robertmaxrees: Even it there is no span on the page method is executed.
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> js is nbot that bad of a language - the DOM APIs are terrible.
[15:20:38] <bdmc> robertmaxrees:  Found it, thanks.  I was using a selector to find all of the fields, and the radio buttons didn't have the class that I was using.  Oops.  B-)
[15:20:41] <berpcor|3> I put alert at the very top.
[15:20:46] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|3 i hahve a hard time believng that.
[15:20:49] <robhol> Not gonna get into this discussion :p
[15:20:52] <berpcor|3> And if there is no span it doesn't triggered.
[15:21:06] <robertmaxrees> robhol you JUST said yopu're not much of a frontend guy, but suddenly you are? ;)
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|3 use a console.log() instead, and make it the first thing in the conditional.
[15:21:46] <robhol> what does this have to do with frontend? Did it occur to you there may be a reason why I prefer to not work frontend web? :p
[15:22:14] <robhol> js isn't the worst, but it certainly has a bunch of insanity in it
[15:22:19] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to pass judgement on something you said you don't have much experience with.  JS as a language isn't that terrible - the DOM APIs are the problem.
[15:22:36] <robhol> no, I have experience with JS. just not web frontend dev
[15:22:43] <robertmaxrees> type coercion can be a pain, sure, and the inheritance mechanism is poorly understood, but it's not nearly that bad.
[15:22:44] <robhol> I don't hate JS, but parts of it are insane
[15:22:48] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[15:22:56] <robhol> types
[15:22:57] <robhol> anyway
[15:23:05] <robhol> I said I wasn't getting into this discussion
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:23:14] <robertmaxrees> just need to make sure you get the last word, eh?
[15:23:15] <robertmaxrees> ;)_
[15:23:34] <robhol> as opposed to you, I suppose.
[15:23:37] <robertmaxrees> anyway, it's not that hard to support back to IE8.  just bring in es5-shim and html5shiv.
[15:24:13] <robertmaxrees> and don't try to use every new DOM api that shows up.  if you want es6 support, use babel, though that's a little heavy-handed imo.
[15:24:41] <robhol> I think I managed to stay away from ES6 in this case
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> but unless you have some terribly compelling reason, i wouldn't worry about supporting users who don't support js.  maybe gracefully degrade.
[15:25:21] <robhol> apart from that startsWith thing, which is insanely late to the game if it's only supported in ES6
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> we have indexOf i guess.
[15:25:49] <robhol> yeah, indexof===0
[15:25:59] <robhol> it just caught me off guard :p
[15:26:05] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWith fwiw
[15:26:16] <robertmaxrees> you could look into a linting/hinting tool for js that can catch those kinds of things.
[15:26:24] <robhol> I guess
[15:26:37] <robertmaxrees> err, you totally could.
[15:26:39] <robhol> But again, I don't do this often enough to really have much of a toolchain installed
[15:26:51] <robertmaxrees> well yeah, so get one :)
[15:27:07] <robhol> Just mucking around with a web page to put on my domain and then it might be years until the next time I do frontend dev ;p
[15:27:09] <robertmaxrees> hell i do mostly frontend JS and I just use some tools built into my editor.
[15:44:56] <yottabyte> are the only differences between jquery 1.11 and 2.1 that 1.11 supports ie 6-8?
[16:00:59] <zzaichik> yep that's the only reason they updated jquery.
[16:01:01] <zzaichik> for IE 6
[16:09:38] <muranjan> Hi I have created a div with drop down inside that.. now when I click on any table TD on that page this drop down I copy in the innerHTML of that TD.. till here things are working… Now I have to click that dropdown and get the id of TD ( or the record id of that row so I can fire some ajax to save the value..)
[16:10:09] <muranjan> Most important point here same drop down is getting copied but id wil be different for each row..
[16:10:54] <muranjan> can I fetch ID of parent element?
[16:29:16] <yottabyte> zzaichik: I can't tell if that was sarcasm
[16:30:51] <zzaichik> var parentId = $('child-el').parents('parent-el').attr('id');
[16:31:03] <zzaichik> super sarcastic.
[17:32:17] <jeffmjack> what to do when app.js is returning '$ is undefined'? e.g. how to fix the race condition with downloading jquery?
[17:33:15] <jeffmjack> (I'd prefer to keep using a cdn for pulling in jquery)
[20:05:06] <chingyy938> is it possible to convert this url into a .json file dynamically via jquery? https://coinmarketcap.com/datapoints/bitcoin/price_usd/
[20:05:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:05:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean, like, save it?
[20:06:33] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: yes
[20:06:39] <chingyy938> if possible xd
[20:06:44] <robertmaxrees> "xd"?
[20:06:48] <chingyy938> without using node.js
[20:06:50] <chingyy938> someone suggested
[20:06:52] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[20:07:13] <chingyy938> ok
[20:07:22] <robertmaxrees> need a server-side setup for that.
[20:12:29] <Ou42> hello
[20:13:01] <Ou42> in JQM, how to issue $( ".selector" ).table("rebuild") ?
[20:14:19] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:14:41] <robertmaxrees> but doing exactly that?
[20:15:35] <robertmaxrees> err, *by
[20:17:01] <Ou42> I'm a jQ / JQM noob... but I've gotten pretty far... but keep getting stuck.
[20:17:09] <robertmaxrees> so what are you stuck on?
[20:17:42] <Ou42> I'm fetching a table via ajax it comes over as a table... i'm reformating it. parsing it and shrinking columns etc
[20:17:49] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:17:56] <Ou42> I'd like to have the table expand to fill the width of the screen.
[20:18:02] <Ou42> I can do that with a static copy of the table
[20:18:26] <Ou42> data-role="table" and data-mode="columntoggle"
[20:18:40] <Ou42> but if I try to set those attributes no go
[20:18:55] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to run that function after you append the table i'm guessing.
[20:19:30] <Ou42> i don't know how to run that function.... I'm not well versed in the $( ) nomenclature.
[20:19:39] <Ou42> but if I was able to fetch the table via:
[20:19:47] <robertmaxrees> err, you've been using jquery right?
[20:19:54] <robertmaxrees> so $() should make sense.
[20:20:06] <Ou42> var table = document.getElementsByTagName("table")[0];  then table should exist.
[20:20:13] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:20:15] <Ou42> jq/jqm
[20:20:16] <robertmaxrees> you use jquery for that.
[20:20:21] <robertmaxrees> $('table')
[20:20:30] <robertmaxrees> you should check out http://learn.jquery.com/
[20:20:50] <Ou42> so what's ".selector"? and why is my table "uninitialized if it's on screen and in the DOM?
[20:21:22] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[20:21:35] <robertmaxrees> really need to run through this.
[20:21:45] <robertmaxrees> basically, that's how you select things with jquery - thing CSS selectors.
[20:24:20] <Ou42> so, $("table").table("rebuild")
[20:24:23] <Ou42> won't work?
[20:24:47] <robertmaxrees> sure it would/.
[20:24:52] <robertmaxrees> as long as it's the only table on the page.
[20:25:07] <Ou42> good q. my js appended a [0] just in case
[20:25:22] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:25:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not "just in case"
[20:25:35] <Ou42> it's a hack. I know.
[20:25:45] <robertmaxrees> it's not a hack, either
[20:25:54] <robertmaxrees> if you use that method, you have to access a particular element.
[20:26:01] <Ou42> I can't access ajax / xmlhttprequest from the desktop. this whole thing is nuts. if I had access to the server I would think there'd be an easier way
[20:26:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:26:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use $.ajax() in the browser. that's all you need/.\
[20:26:49] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: http://paste.ofcode.org/6p9EmkGA5rwSkHNS9fZYEt
[20:26:51] <Ou42> i'm editing a static copy of a table that is supposed to be fetched dynamically, but due to CORS common origin mumbo jumbo I"m stuck
[20:27:02] <chingyy938> that worked XD
[20:27:06] <Ou42> doesn't work due to different domains
[20:27:11] <Ou42> works on android though
[20:27:14] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 that's not mumbo jumbo - it's a good thing.
[20:27:24] <robertmaxrees> setup a server and you'll be fine.
[20:27:58] <Ou42> if i set up a server on my home pc I'd be able to get past CORS?
[20:28:20] <robertmaxrees> do you own the site you're requesting data from?
[20:29:27] <Ou42> nope, but got permission to attempt this. trying to make a mobile app to access the data
[20:29:35] <robertmaxrees> "permission to attempt" what?
[20:29:39] <Ou42> but the data comes over as <tables>
[20:29:58] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: me?
[20:29:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.  either way, you could proxy through your own box and process that data there instead.
[20:30:04] <robertmaxrees> Ou42
[20:30:09] <chingyy938> oke
[20:30:14] <Ou42> the guy that made the site said it was OK for me to try to make a mobile app. the tables are huge. don't fit mobile screens. not responsive web design.
[20:30:35] <chingyy938> Ill make your site responsive for free
[20:30:44] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 never do free work.
[20:30:47] <Ou42> i'm already doing it for free
[20:30:51] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[20:30:52] <robertmaxrees> :(
[20:31:00] <Ou42> i need something on my resume
[20:31:01] <robertmaxrees> don't distrobute that, then.
[20:31:01] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: why o.o
[20:31:16] <Ou42> the site is free. kinda hard to sell something that is free to begin with
[20:31:17] <robertmaxrees> doing free work devalues the profession and gives you clients who don't value your work.
[20:31:27] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: +1
[20:31:34] <chingyy938> i'll keep that in mind
[20:31:38] <Ou42> i totally agree.. but I'm not "in" yet. no clients.
[20:31:43] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[20:31:47] <Ou42> need to beef up the resume
[20:31:52] <robertmaxrees> irrelevant.
[20:31:56] <robertmaxrees> get paid gigs.
[20:32:00] <robertmaxrees> don't ever work for free.
[20:32:22] <Ou42> OK, then consider this from a diff perspective. this is my shooling.
[20:32:28] <Ou42> and I"m paying for it.
[20:32:32] <robertmaxrees> If it's a personal project?  Great!
[20:32:38] <robertmaxrees> proof of concept?  that's fantastic.
[20:32:44] <Ou42> personal as in, hey, I did this... hire me.
[20:32:46] <robertmaxrees> Doing something for somebody else?  Nope.
[20:33:00] <Ou42> not someone else... the world. it will make the world a btter place
[20:33:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:33:13] <Ou42> the site is free
[20:33:17] <robertmaxrees> because you're using somebody else's stuff.
[20:33:18] <Ou42> they guy that made the site did it for free
[20:33:19] <robertmaxrees> work with them.
[20:33:20] <chingyy938> freelancer is full of cheap labour :(
[20:33:25] <robertmaxrees> what is the site, Ou42?
[20:33:55] <Ou42> u sure you aren't going to do it for free too? there's a large chance you'd finish before 2020, which is the pace I'm working at
[20:34:00] <Ou42> :p
[20:34:01] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[20:34:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:34:05] <Ou42> :D
[20:34:11] <Ou42> ficsgames.org
[20:34:18] <robertmaxrees> and you're not going to get very far without setting up your own server to handle the data issues.
[20:34:35] <arc_> this site again o_O
[20:34:41] <Ou42> again?
[20:34:44] <Ou42> who's been asking?
[20:34:54] <robertmaxrees> they should set up an api for you to hit imo.
[20:35:00] <Ou42> amen!
[20:35:02] <arc_> actually i guess the other guy was working on the actual site where you play games, not this
[20:35:03] <Ou42> sing it brother!
[20:35:21] <robertmaxrees> arc_ yep.  different site.
[20:35:46] <Ou42> it's a database of games played on FICS... freechess.org
[20:36:24] <chingyy938> how can i put my graphs on the same line with jquery? XD https://gbtc.us/
[20:36:33] <robertmaxrees> by using css.
[20:36:38] <chingyy938> 50% 50% with css doesn't work :/
[20:36:45] <robertmaxrees> figure out why.
[20:36:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:36:58] <chingyy938> ill try again
[20:37:04] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css
[20:37:12] <chingyy938> done
[20:37:31] <robertmaxrees> now you play the waiting game :)
[20:38:11] <Ou42> back to .selectors ... if the table heading is coming over as:
[20:38:17] <robertmaxrees> stop
[20:38:19] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[20:38:20] <robertmaxrees> read
[20:38:21] <robertmaxrees> )
[20:38:23] <robertmaxrees> *:)
[20:38:46] <Ou42> 			<table class="result-table"> ... do I access it by it's class? it doesn't have an id....
[20:39:08] <chingyy938> I only learn by ripping someone elses code and editing it
[20:39:08] <robertmaxrees> yes.  learn.jquery.com and other tutorials cover this pretty in-depth. you should read them.
[20:39:09] <chingyy938> haha
[20:39:17] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 that;'s not learning then, is it? ;)
[20:39:27] <Ou42> cheat steal & lie
[20:39:31] <chingyy938> reverse engineering*
[20:39:43] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 that's... not what that is.
[20:39:48] <chingyy938> looooool
[20:40:36] <chingyy938> css nubs asleep :(
[20:40:43] <chingyy938> 1:40 am here in the uk
[20:42:26] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[20:42:37] <robertmaxrees> 5:42 here in california.
[20:43:33] <Ou42> OK, if I cannot get rebuild to work, should I load the ajax POST table into a hidden element and then manually ( via js ) make a new table with the data-role="table" etc set so it fills the screen?
[20:43:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:44:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to rebuild.
[20:44:09] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting data with CORS in the way?
[20:44:16] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: are you a moderator here?
[20:44:37] <robertmaxrees> MAYBE
[20:44:37] <Ou42> I'm not. I saved a coy of the table and working on it. when I get far enough along I test it in cordova + bluestacks.
[20:44:39] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:45:17] <chingyy938> cool
[20:45:19] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 https://api.jquerymobile.com/table-reflow/
[20:45:21] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[20:50:04] <Ou42> tyvm. they don't use "refresh" in the example. :(
[20:50:45] <Ou42> I read that once the table has been "parsed" by jQuery it's done. so adding the data-role & data-mode attr didn't do anything.
[20:52:49] <Ou42> and ... he's gone.
[21:05:40] <chingyy938> shocking ratio, virgin media http://www.speedtest.net/result/4811192116.png
[21:06:50] <Ou42> show off
[21:06:52] <Ou42> :p
[21:07:04] <chingyy938> uk upload speed is the worst xd
[21:07:10] <Ou42> I'm lucky if I get 1/3rd your upload speed as my DL speed
[21:07:20] <chingyy938> :( XD
[21:09:09] <drej> thats horrible uplink
[21:09:16] <chingyy938> i know right
[21:09:28] <chingyy938> england is Sh*t for upload speed
[21:09:33] <Ou42> u guys are mean
[21:09:39] <Ou42> i don't want to play with you anymore
[21:09:49] <Ou42> 11.6 up / 1.2 down
[21:10:01] <chingyy938> lmaooo
[21:10:09] <drej> http://www.speedtest.net/result/4811199234.png
[21:10:10] <chingyy938> which country?
[21:10:28] <chingyy938> drej u use dedi?
[21:10:29] <chingyy938> xd
[21:10:35] <drej> fiber
[21:10:43] <chingyy938> dedicated server?
[21:10:45] <chingyy938> or home connection
[21:10:47] <drej> home
[21:10:55] <chingyy938> amazing uplink
[21:10:56] <drej> i recently downgraded to save a few bucks
[21:11:00] <drej> i had 500/500
[21:11:00] <chingyy938> is it leased line? or shared
[21:11:11] <drej> its a fiber optic cable that goes straight into the closet of my condo unit
[21:11:17] <drej> and peered with a datacenter
[21:11:21] <chingyy938> o.o
[21:11:33] <drej> advantage of living in a new building :)
[21:11:38] <chingyy938> guess how much i pay for 210 / 12
[21:11:45] <chingyy938> £31 a month
[21:11:51] <drej> i pay $45cad
[21:11:52] <Ou42> less than I pay?
[21:11:56] <drej> :)
[21:12:02] <chingyy938> $45 cad only
[21:12:03] <chingyy938> damnnnnnn
[21:12:19] <drej> https://beanfield.com/high-speed-internet.html
[21:12:29] <drej> can get up to 500mbit for $100/mo
[21:12:31] <Ou42> i don't think it'll reach us
[21:12:35] <chingyy938> bandwidth is expensive in uk, when i go to buy a dedicated server it's always cheapest in canada
[21:12:43] <chingyy938> from OVH
[21:13:00] <drej> digitalocean ftw
[21:13:14] <drej> i might be coming to the UK in the new year
[21:13:24] <chingyy938> ya i like the convenience of cloud
[21:13:33] <chingyy938> awesome have fun
[21:14:07] <drej> it'll be for work
[21:14:16] <drej> i mean, i always have fun :)
[21:14:53] <chingyy938> https://www.soyoustart.com/ca/en/essential-servers/
[21:15:19] <drej> nice, although why not go with something like DO ?
[21:15:34] <chingyy938> because it's dedicated not cloud
[21:15:48] <chingyy938> i use Vultr to spin cloud vps fast
[21:15:56] <drej> digitalocean is absolutely cloud based :)
[21:15:56] <chingyy938> similar to DO
[21:16:01] <chingyy938> yea
[21:16:04] <drej> oh you're looking for dedi
[21:16:04] <drej> got it
[21:16:07] <drej> i misunderstood
[21:16:13] <chingyy938> :D
[21:16:20] <drej> its friday night, im slow
[21:16:28] <chingyy938> np XD
[21:16:42] <chingyy938> So you speak french?
[21:16:58] <chingyy938> is french your 1st language, english 2nd?
[21:17:26] <drej> nah, french is mostly quebec
[21:17:31] <drej> also i wasnt born here anyway
[21:17:33] <chingyy938> oh
[21:17:59] <drej> i speak -some- french and understand it pretty well
[21:18:02] <drej> but im not fluent
[21:18:14] <chingyy938> lol my ISP went down the other day and they messed up IP allocation, my ip is now geo located 300 miles away
[21:18:20] <drej> although im going to montreal (which is predominantly french speaking) in a week
[21:18:32] <chingyy938> cool
[21:20:43] <drej> https://www.soyoustart.com/ca/en/offers/e3-ssd-2.xml
[21:20:50] <drej> wow that price is almost too good to be true
[21:21:13] <chingyy938> i've had several of those
[21:21:16] <chingyy938> at once :D

[22:32:00] <brayden_> Is there a way to restrict a field to only allow numbers/letters to be inputted in a predefined order?
[22:32:31] <brayden_> I have a field for postal code and the format needs to be A0A-A0A where a is letter and 0 is number.
[22:32:41] <brayden_> Sans dash by the way.

[22:38:06] <Ou42> so quite here. never thought 617 ppl could be so quiet
[22:38:14] <Ou42> brayden_ u still here?
[22:38:29] <brayden_> ya men
[22:38:49] <Foxhoundz> hello
[22:40:23] <Ou42> brayden_ : will this help you? http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp
[22:40:55] <brayden_> ew w3 schools...I dont go there EVAR!
[22:42:17] <Ou42> why not?
[22:42:23] <Ou42> it could be what you were looking for
[22:43:10] <brayden_> Cause it's content causes blindness I'd rather try to extract javascript help from the holy quaran to be honest.
[22:43:37] <Ou42> I don't follow
[22:44:32] <Ou42> beyond that page, I'd guess you'd neeed to do some sort of onChange event or something and check it yourself... but maybe there is something built in
[22:44:50] <Ou42> ( that isn't on w3schools ) :p
[22:46:33] <brayden_> Now I'ma figure it out, but developer.mozilla.com is the best site of all time.
