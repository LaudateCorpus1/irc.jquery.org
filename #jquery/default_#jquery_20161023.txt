[01:18:42] <hlve> Any idea why this isn't working? https://jsfiddle.net/yfxw6g7t/1/
[01:18:56] <hlve> assuming it has something to do with the brackets in the match statement
[01:32:54] <hlve> ? :[
[06:15:25] <chipyy> people one question :D i have input type="file" how could i check in jquery if there is any file inside selected?
[06:15:40] <chipyy> can i check with empty() ?
[06:24:24] <chipyy> anybody here?
[06:31:19] <shoky_> chipyy i think you can check its value  (e.g. with .val() )
[06:31:30] <chipyy> i just found it
[06:31:31] <shoky_> or maybe it was another property
[06:31:48] <chipyy> what would be the best option to check if input has only images
[06:32:05] <chipyy> i guess i woud need using regex right?
[06:32:20] <shoky_> ah no you can check the .files property of the element
[06:32:25] <shoky_> or .prop('files') with jquery
[06:32:56] <chipyy> ok, first i will check with jquery and then also with php for more security
[06:33:01] <shoky_> doesn't really matter if it's with regex or not
[06:33:14] <chipyy> can u give me any suggestion what should i check with this options?
[06:33:29] <chipyy> and mybe some advices about max size of images? (MB) ?
[06:33:43] <shoky_> i don't have any advice about that ;)
[06:34:04] <shoky_> maybe your app needs 1GB images, how should i know :0
[06:34:05] <shoky_> :)
[06:34:40] <chipyy> aha, i will store pictures of events. So like you have on facebook main picture of event
[06:34:51] <chipyy> i hope you understand me :)
[06:35:00] <shoky_> do you want users to be able to upload a 50MB image ?
[06:35:26] <chipyy> i think that there would be a need for 50mb, i think that 5mb would be more then enough
[06:35:37] <chipyy> wouldnt*
[06:35:43] <shoky_> if 5mb is more than enough, then 5mb is fine for your limit.
[06:35:49] <shoky_> see, you answered yourself.
[06:36:14] <chipyy> about that i am yes :) but i dont know how huge are this picture normaly :)
[06:36:53] <chipyy> but if i remember correctly 16mp camera on phone makes about 4mb pictures , so i guess that pictures made with photoshop or something like that wont be so big?
[06:37:03] <shoky_> sounds like you know enough :)
[06:37:38] <chipyy> i am not 100% about that, this are my thoughts :)
[06:38:00] <chipyy> damn, why i dont call my college which was photographer XD
[06:38:13] <shoky_> ;z
[06:38:13] <chipyy> my brains are always on OFF
[06:38:25] <shoky_> try coffee or sugar
[06:45:37] <chipyy> i dont drink that :D i rather drink redbull,burn (chemichals) :D
[06:45:47] <chipyy> buddy said 5 MB would be great
[06:46:23] <chipyy> and then when i show this pictures i should resize them and make their size smaller for faster loading and this would be it :)
[10:11:15] <ebin> why http://pastebin.com/8z29LZdj doesn't show text on canvas? rectacle is drawn perfectly.
[10:18:20] <shoky_> ebin: it does. but the 0, 0 is the bottom-left  corner of the text so you probably want to change to 0, 10  or something. and also you haven't changed the color so the text color is same as the rectangle
[10:19:41] <shoky_> ebin: https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/8/
[10:20:13] <ebin> ah. ty. now it works
[10:20:26] <ebin> also the color was the problem
[10:20:38] <ebin> but now i can work with it. ty.
[10:20:58] <ebin> shoky++
[10:21:05] <ebin> shoky+
[10:21:14] <shoky_> ebin:  and about the y value, you can also do ctx.textBaseline = 'top';   and then you can keep it 0,0
[10:21:34] <shoky_> https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/9/
[10:23:26] <ebin> ty very much.
[11:59:42] <veverak> hi folks, can I add multiple "submit" callbacks to form?
[12:27:30] <stemid> when I'm in a $('form').on('submit', function() { is it possible to use $(this) to get the element of a button inside that form? instead of using $('#buttonId') ?
[12:32:57] <shoky_> stemid: yes. $(this).find(selector)   but if it has an id it doesn't really matter
[12:43:34] <stemid> thanks :)
[12:45:39] <fas3r> hello
[12:46:35] <fas3r> if I have a string : "text_block1 text_block2 text_block3", is it possible with a regex to get each block individually ?
[12:47:22] <fas3r> each block is separate with a space.
[13:23:38] <stevooo> Howdy folks
[13:26:37] <stevooo> I'm struggling with an internal question of mine, it it worth re-learning jQuery, how's webdesign business nowadays. I wrote alot of html, css, javascript and some jQuery like 5-6 years ago, but when i started my mechanical degree i kinda went away from the webcoding into more software. So it jQuery worth time learning ?
[13:45:52] <arc_> stevooo if you already know how to code, jquery takes like a few minutes to learn the basics of and then it's just a matter of remembering all the different methods when you want to use them, which doesn't really take that long. and if you don't remember exactly how something works it's simple to just look it up in the documentation
[14:29:41] <stevooo> thanks for the reply arc_
[15:42:13] <joaocastanho> How can I submit a form either by clicking Enter or clicking button ?
[15:42:27] <joaocastanho> $("#form").on('submit',
[15:42:38] <joaocastanho> will this work for click enter and click button ?
[18:09:00] <patrickk> which is most basic parallax plugin out of the box for <div> elements and not the backgrounds
[19:35:26] <tlund> On a webpage that uses $.getJSON is there a way that works in a modern chrome+tampermonkey to intercept/log that data? I found lots of results searching, but found none of them that still worked and several had comments saying "this is depricated. :)
[23:33:12] <tombin> hi jquery experts - i am learning jquery now and am experiencing an issue.  i have 1 function that adds a row to a table that has a form with a submit button.  and a second with a post action for that button.  if i move the form into my main html body, the script works fine.  but it fails when adding it to the table.
[23:33:18] <tombin> is this not acceptable ?
[23:54:09] <arc_> tombin need to see code
[23:55:22] <tombin> arc_ : https://codepaste.net/owxcak
[23:57:11] <arc_> few things. if you bind to 'a' here that means if someone clicks any link on the page it will run this code. you may already know that but it's worth pointing out
[23:57:26] <arc_> second of all if you're only appending this once why don't you just put it into the html to begin with
[23:57:55] <tombin> there could be multiple adds
[23:59:11] <arc_> ok. then second of all, an html element's id must be unique
[23:59:17] <tombin> i wanted to have the option of adding multiple lines of data from the main page
[23:59:29] <tombin> yes, i'm aware thats broken
