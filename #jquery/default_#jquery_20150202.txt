[00:35:18] <Woet> CreativeWolf: you got rid of your onclick="login()" but aren't binding to the click or submit event
[00:35:29] <Woet> CreativeWolf: also, you probably want $(document).ready(function () { outside the function
[00:36:06] <Woet> CreativeWolf: move  $(document).ready(function () { + the .mobile settings outside the function, then replace the "function login(event) {" with a .submit event on #loginForm

[00:36:11] <prohobo> emocakes what the hell are those '=>' things in ur array
[00:36:20] <emocakes> i dont know
[00:36:45] <prohobo> does it work?
[00:36:52] <emocakes> no
[00:36:53] <Woet> prohobo: that's PHP code.
[00:36:56] <emocakes> that is why i am here
[00:36:57] <prohobo> ooh
[00:37:09] <CreativeWolf> Woet: Thanks much, will tinker that.
[00:37:09] <prohobo> ah ye the echo
[00:37:26] <emocakes> Woet, can you help me with my php?
[00:37:40] <Woet> emocakes: no, this is #jquery, not ##php
[00:37:52] <emocakes> can you help me in ##php?
[00:38:02] <prohobo> also PHP is laaame
[00:38:26] <Woet> emocakes: depends whether you're ever gonna read the link I gave you, read the docs and ask useful questions
[01:02:03] <gho> Anyone know datauri alternative for large files eg 20mb
[01:02:22] <Cork> gho: context please
[01:02:47] <gho> Download files decrypted in browser
[01:02:56] <Cork> ?mdn blob
[01:02:58] <b-ot> Cork: Blob - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[01:04:17] <gho> How do you save blob
[01:04:29] <Cork> save? to the users computer?
[01:04:35] <gho> Yes
[01:04:58] <Cork> ?mdn createObjectURL
[01:05:00] <b-ot> Cork: URL.createObjectURL - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL.createObjectURL
[01:05:04] <gho> I'm decrypting email attachments in javascript
[01:05:50] <Cork> it's in the in the first link if you'd bothered to check
[01:06:14] <CreativeWolf> Woet: Made changes as per your recommendations - http://jsfiddle.net/CreativeWolf/64p45f9t/17/ - Is there something else I can try?
[01:06:48] <Woet> CreativeWolf: get rid of the onclick
[01:07:21] <gho> Is that part of the depreciated file api?
[01:07:30] <Cork> file isn't deprecated
[01:07:53] <CreativeWolf> Woet: Oops, missed that, done that now - http://jsfiddle.net/CreativeWolf/64p45f9t/18/
[01:08:01] <gho> Ok. So I just put that in an a href or windows.location?
[01:08:23] <Cork> that might work, never actually tried
[01:08:32] <gho> Ok cheers for the tip
[01:08:32] <Cork> you might have to create a link though
[01:08:57] <Cork> cause of the "trusted event" handling browsers do to prevent high-jacking
[01:09:30] <gho> Yes not worried about them having to click. Just datauri freezes browser for 20secs
[01:09:41] <CreativeWolf> Woet: Now the submit won't fire anything - Changing that to <input type instead of button...
[01:09:55] <Cork> well ya data uri takes 20-50% extra space
[01:10:01] <Cork> so...
[01:12:23] <Omar-> CreativeWolf what are you trying to achieve?
[01:12:36] <CreativeWolf> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/CreativeWolf/64p45f9t/22/ - Now it fires but the page won't change.
[01:12:40] <Cork> Omar-: <gho> I'm decrypting email attachments in javascript
[01:12:53] <Cork> oh, sorry >_<'
[01:13:01] <Cork> wrong question _/
[01:13:06] <Omar-> haha
[01:13:11] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/CreativeWolf/64p45f9t/22/ - Upon authentication successful, trying to go to a different page...
[01:13:31] <Omar-> CreativeWolf which version are you using?
[01:13:36] <Omar-> 1.3 or 1.4?
[01:14:13] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Only 1.3b available on jsfiddle...
[01:14:55] <Omar-> 1.4 is available too
[01:14:55] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: But on my development environment, using 1.4
[01:15:16] <Omar-> CreativeWolf http://jsfiddle.net/64p45f9t/25/
[01:16:54] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Woah. That worked!
[01:17:08] <CreativeWolf> Woet: It worked! :)
[01:17:29] <prohobo> bobob
[01:17:32] <prohobo> bo
[01:17:36] <Woet> nice, don't use jquery mobile myself, didn't know a version made that much difference
[01:18:04] <Omar-> CreativeWolf :)
[01:18:16] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: In my dev environment, currently using jquery-1.9.1 - should I change to 1.11.0 ?
[01:18:24] <Omar-> CreativeWolf two notes: 1) use "mobileinit" to override default settings
[01:18:48] <Omar-> 2) use $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("change", "#page/URL", { options });
[01:19:00] <Omar-> CreativeWolf 1.9 is sufficient
[01:20:27] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Cool, thanks much! :)
[01:21:59] <Omar-> i'm fixing your code to show you how you should script jQM
[01:26:49] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Thanks! :)
[01:29:47] <Omar-> CreativeWolf there you go http://plnkr.co/edit/hffB3OFEyJvKW96pFfrJ
[01:29:58] <ufk> hello
[01:30:05] <ufk> can i use cors ajax request using jquery?
[01:32:09] <Cork> ufk: yes
[01:36:17] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Thanks, nothing happens when I give correct credentials and submit...
[01:37:10] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: But the one in jsfiddle, after changing jquery Mobile version, it worked like a charm, and I've used $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("change", "#page/URL", { options }); :)
[01:37:47] <Omar-> CreativeWolf maybe I forgot to add something
[01:37:50] <Omar-> i'll check it
[01:37:57] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Thanks :)
[01:41:49] <Omar-> CreativeWolf I just wrapped your code in pagecreate event http://embed.plnkr.co/hffB3OFEyJvKW96pFfrJ/script.js
[01:42:09] <Omar-> http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/
[02:05:29] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Thanks, will look at it :)
[02:05:47] <Omar-> CreativeWolf sure :) feel free to ask me anything related to jQM
[02:06:36] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Sweet. Will do! :)
[02:09:26] <Omar-> CreativeWolf i mis-spelled "success" in the demo
[02:09:42] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Ahh.
[02:12:07] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Now it works fine. Got some queries... 1. Point me to something to learn about how to keep the session on, unless logged out 2. How do I prevent going back to previous page when back button is pressed?
[02:12:45] <Omar-> CreativeWolf 1. i'm not experienced in such things :D
[02:13:15] <Omar-> 2. you can redirect user to another page if last page in history is "login" page
[02:13:41] <Omar-> CreativeWolf https://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/detect-back-navigation/
[02:20:19] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Awesome! Trying that now :)
[02:20:37] <Omar-> CreativeWolf it's pretty easy ;)
[02:39:30] <gho_> what are the problems representing binary data as a string? I'm trying to base64 decode a jpg file but quite a lot of the bytes are being corrupted.
[02:40:11] <gtristan> gho_, sounds odd, base64 is ridiculously easy to encode/decode
[02:40:50] <gho_> gtristan, http://snag.gy/8ySvJ.jpg
[02:40:58] <gho_> those are the differences, the top is the original
[02:41:50] <gtristan> what are you using to encode/decode then ?
[02:42:12] <gho_> I've tried a atob() which is even worse than that, and another base64 decoder
[02:42:15] <gtristan> and more importantly, is something happening outside of that encoding, like string escaping and such ?
[02:42:19] <gho_> I'm loading it into a blob and then using createobjecturl
[02:42:42] <gho_> just trying to get a pastebin of the code hang on
[02:43:09] <gho_> code: http://pastebin.com/UvGSUTqY
[02:44:30] <gho_> if I use a dataurl instead of blobs it works fine but I'm using large files and datauri doesnt scale
[02:49:21] <gtristan> gho_, well, it's hard to tell what's going wrong... is it possible to find out if the problem occurs before or after using Blob ?
[02:49:58] <gtristan> I would rather suspect the blob needs different semantics, than suspect that the Base64 (whatever that API is), is doing it wrong
[02:50:22] <gtristan> then again, there is part.part... which is the third possible point of failure
[02:50:52] <gtristan> and possibly more likely, I dont know... maybe something happens to it over the wire, which needs to 'unhappen' before you try decoding it
[02:51:56] <gho_> The weird thing is my Base64.decode() produces results much closer than atob().  part.part is definitely ok because if I dump the base64 to the screen and then decode on the command line it works fine.
[02:52:14] <gho_> blob is a possibilility - especially as it works with datauri.  are there any other things I should be doing with blob?
[02:52:58] <mdev> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50354233/jquery.png
[02:53:04] <mdev> if anyone can tell me what type of control that is
[02:53:16] <mdev> i'll tip you a 1000 dogecoins
[02:53:37] <gtristan> gho, well, you are telling it its application/octet-stream or such
[02:54:02] <gtristan> gho, should the blob not have already the correct mime type of the image ? you are giving it already decoded binary afaics
[02:54:59] <gho_> Hmm just tried it with image/jpg and no change
[03:01:42] <mdev> thought someone might know, dang
[03:03:39] <gho_> gtristan, thanks anyway for your help
[03:11:03] <gho_> gtristan, nailed it!
[03:11:10] <gho_> gtristan, http://blog.danguer.com/2011/10/24/base64-binary-decoding-in-javascript/
[03:12:05] <gtristan> haha
[03:12:10] <gtristan> gho_, good :)
[03:15:59] <Tennis> I have an unordered list that removes elements when clicked however i seem to be able to remove 2 at once if i click between them , any idea how i can combat this?
[03:16:49] <guy> I must be doing something wrong. I have a script[type="text/template"] element. I need to make a clone of its inner content to use as a template.
[03:16:49] <guy> $($.parseHTML($('#template-location-screening').html()))
[03:17:00] <guy> This is what I am doing, which doesn't feel right.
[03:17:16] <prohobo> tennis, in the selector you're probably grabbing 2 elements, so just slap a [0] on it
[03:17:20] <prohobo> to get the first element
[03:17:29] <guy> Or, because it is in text/template, it is not parsed into DOM by the browser and I actually need to use parseHTML?
[03:17:46] <prohobo> lolmaus, your name kind of looks like lolanus
[03:17:53] <prohobo> it threw me off
[03:20:56] <lolmaus> prohobo: your nickname kinda looks like "prohomo" which explains why you talk about anuses in a programmers chatroom
[03:21:29] <prohobo> you're right
[03:45:06] <Chulbul> I'm using bootstrap popover for jquery validations, now I have close button on error message popover, problem is when I click on close popover button, it gets closed easily but if that input has focus on it, it wants me to click twice on close button, first close removes focus but at the same time it displays error again, any suggestion how to resolve it ?
[03:45:31] <__john_doe__> hey guys, can anyone help me figure out keypress, keydown and keyup jquery event on tablet?
[03:45:36] <__john_doe__> or point to a good article
[03:48:16] <Chulbul> or is there anythin that I can use to shift focus somewhere else or remove focus from everything (one line code instead of code for all input/text fields) and then hide event to hide popover ?
[03:48:58] <FruityLoops> Good evening or morning all. I am having an issue with the jquery animate function. I've got some boxes that expand and then contract. They expand when they are clicked on and contract when the background of the page is clicked on.
[03:49:45] <FruityLoops> I've told the animation to go 'slow'. It doesn't do this. Although unusually it does when i call the function by pressing a key (the escape key is bound to the reset the box function).
[03:50:06] <FruityLoops> why would the animation do what is is told when i activate via keypress but not via mouse click.
[03:52:10] <FruityLoops> Actually I think I just solved it by talking it through. The mouse click method works by targeting 'html' except for the box div (so that clicking outside the box contracts it but clicking inside the box doesn't). I achieved this with event.stopPropogation(). That's probably what is doing it. I'll investigate.
[03:52:20] <FruityLoops> Thanks for listening gang.
[03:53:01] <MajorWork> onclick and a keypress different events? send us some code to fiddle with
[03:53:29] <MajorWork> sounds like you solved it sweet
[03:53:56] <FruityLoops> Maybe I'll do some fiddling myself and come back if I can't fix it. Thank you MajorWork.
[03:53:59] <Uhkis> FruityLoops: try http://duckie.me/ next time :-)
[03:54:09] <FruityLoops> Ha yeah sure
[03:54:49] <FruityLoops> Cheers Uhkis. Number of times this has happened. I ask my girlfriend for coding assistance all the time even though she hasn't written a line in her life. She still solves half my problems though
[03:55:11] <Uhkis> FruityLoops: it happens a lot
[03:58:25] <FruityLoops> Okay as far as I can tell the event.propogation bit isn't called when i click on the background. I might need help after all. Anyone able could you check out http://hensonstitch.me
[03:58:45] <FruityLoops> Thanks muchly. Excuse the dog's breakfast coding technique; it's my first handcoded site.
[03:59:49] <FruityLoops> So to re-iterate: The box contract animation should be slow. It is slow when I activate it with the escape it. It is fast when I use the click event I made.
[04:12:46] <FruityLoops> MajorWork are you able to take a look at this? I've tried various combination of nesting the animation and fade functions and using callbacks and whatnot, but nothing seems to work.
[04:14:55] <Tennis> different username but same person , sure if you put it in a jsfiddle or a pastee i'll take a look FruityLoops
[04:15:28] <Tennis> oh hensonstitch cool
[04:15:45] <FruityLoops> Sorry Tennis I tried a JSfiddle but it came up with nothing. Can't figure out why.
[04:16:08] <Tennis> cool I'll look at the link you  gave
[04:16:14] <FruityLoops> If it is an obvious solution and I should have figured it out from just re-reading the documentation then I apologise. Thanks muchly.
[04:24:49] <Tennis> Is it the boxes expanding you want to be slower?
[04:25:04] <Tennis> I can see your site but I can't see underhood to whats calling the animation
[04:26:23] <FruityLoops> No the boxes contracting. When you click on the black background they contract. But it is really fast.
[04:26:43] <FruityLoops> And the boxes contract before the text fades out.
[04:27:51] <FruityLoops> But if I use the escape key it give me the expected behaviour  (my expected behaviour anyway): the box contracts slowly, with the text fading while the contraction occurs rather than after
[04:29:29] <FruityLoops> It used to work in an older version of the site. But the only change I can identify (using vimdiff even) is that I've split the two animations (expanding and contracting) into two functions. Not sure why this would affect it. And I'm certainly at a loss as to why the function behaves differently when activated via keypress versus mouseclick
[04:30:37] <FruityLoops> Oh sorry I though that said 'understood' not 'underhood'/
[04:30:54] <FruityLoops> The animation code is at http://hensonstitch.me/expand.js
[04:31:08] <FruityLoops> It's the resetBox function..
[04:31:12] <Omar-> FruityLoops this drove me crazy to be honest
[04:31:24] <Omar-> i'm sure it has to do with clikc event
[04:31:38] <Omar-> click*
[04:32:07] <FruityLoops> you've had a similar problem before Omar?
[04:32:37] <Omar-> no, I tried to fix for you
[04:33:26] <FruityLoops> Oh. Gee. Thanks muchly. Sorry it is driving you crazy. I'm going a little mad here myself.
[04:37:37] <reynierpm> hi there, can I get some advice here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28269745/find-key-in-javascript-object-and-get-values-for-each-one
[04:38:51] <aro> has anyone seen weird behavior on sortable/draggable going to a scrolled list?
[04:39:19] <FruityLoops> Omar, do you have any idea why the website wouldn't work on a JSFiddle? I'll try posting the problem to stackoverflow but I can't get it working. Just has a black screen, no columns.
[04:40:12] <FruityLoops> Tennis: Thank you for trying. I'll ask elsewhere although it looks like I might have to try another tack. Maybe keep both animations in the same function like it was before.
[04:40:35] <Omar-> FruityLoops http://jsbin.com/casobawuce/1/edit?js,output
[04:41:50] <Omar-> reynierpm can you pastein.com sample of the array?
[04:42:05] <Omar-> reynierpm http://pastebin.com/
[04:42:21] <FruityLoops> Thanks Omar. The animation is still not-so-nice compared to the one generated by the escape key. I'll keep trying. Appreciate it.
[04:42:38] <Omar-> FruityLoops it's not fixed.
[04:43:03] <Omar-> the problem lies somewhere behind click event
[04:43:03] <Tennis> perhaps some of the file dependencies
[04:43:23] <Tennis> paste the code for the animation functions somewhere
[04:43:48] <reynierpm> Omar yes, sure, give me a minute
[04:46:20] <FruityLoops> Tennis are you talking to me? There are no file dependencies. Besides jquery. Unless you mean the html loremipsum text it is importing into the columns. The animation functions are at http://hensonstitch.me/expand.js
[04:47:39] <FruityLoops> They are here also: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=guEcLAwA
[04:49:41] <FruityLoops> Removing the few file dependencies and using placeholder text instead makes no difference.
[04:51:48] <reynierpm> Omar here is the JSON http://pastebin.com/KUC3dBA7
[04:52:48] <Tennis> cool
[04:53:24] <Omar-> reynierpm thanks.
[04:53:40] <Tennis> 'slow' is that the bit thats not working?
[04:54:36] <reynierpm> Omar let me show you what I need to achieve
[04:54:41] <reynierpm> perhaps my code is no so good
[04:55:29] <Omar-> reynierpm ok
[04:56:51] <reynierpm> Omar see this pic http://content.screencast.com/users/ReynierPM/folders/Snagit/media/b037c746-f73e-48ff-988c-026cead9036d/02.02.2015-08.22.png this are the paisesFabricanteModeloMarca on the JSON value
[04:57:07] <FruityLoops> Tennis: Yes. And some timing issues. The text should fade out as the box contracts. Currently the box contracts then the text fades out.
[04:57:49] <reynierpm> Omar then on this other pic http://content.screencast.com/users/ReynierPM/folders/Snagit/media/ad30ed2a-f65b-48ab-a127-caf50571adfa/02.02.2015-08.22.png each row on the table has been associated with each value from the table from the image below for that reason you will see three 15, 16, 17 and so on
[04:58:06] <reynierpm> Omar then what I need is to put that relation on the second td
[04:58:10] <FruityLoops> Omar: !!! It might be the hover event (or something to do with it). The "pressing escape makes the animation work properly" behaviour only occurs while I keep my cursor on the animating box.
[04:58:22] <reynierpm> Omar (did you speak Spanish) can we go to PM?
[04:58:37] <Tennis> can you replace slow with specific numbers?
[04:58:46] <Omar-> reynierpm hablo espanol pero poco
[04:58:57] <Omar-> si puedes, adelante
[04:59:10] <Omar-> FruityLoops you have hover CSS?
[04:59:12] <Omar-> i didn't notice
[04:59:29] <Tennis> Im being silly here and perhaps highlighting my ignorance but perhaps uses "'s instead of "'"s
[05:00:08] <FruityLoops> Yes. It makes the box-shadow expand and raises the opacity to 1. I'll remove it all and see if that makes a different

[05:09:26] <ashka> hi, I have an issue with multiple forms on a single page, when selecting only one and applying .serialize(), it returns a serialized string of all the forms in the page
[05:09:41] <Woet> ashka: how are you selecting only one?
[05:09:48] <Woet> what is your selector?
[05:09:52] <ashka> $('.parentClass form')
[05:10:02] <ashka> I checked, it does return only one form
[05:10:09] <Woet> ashka: put the relevant HTML and jQuery on www.jsfiddle.net
[05:10:21] <FruityLoops> Omar. I fixed it. It was some increase box-shadow on hover code that I had accidentally included twice, one in the wrong div. So sorry to waste your time with what seemed like an interesting problem but was just me being careless. Thank you again.
[05:12:36] <ashka> my bad. was actually my fault and not a bug of some sort, sorry
[05:12:47] <Woet> no problem
[05:14:44] <Omar-> FruityLoops i'm glad you got it fixed :)
[05:18:50] <FruityLoops> I have one last question. Should be much more simple. The expanding columns. How do I cleanly instruct them to expand to the right edge of the fourth column. I am using percentages at the moment. but they don't work properly (the alignment is off depending on the screen) and I know there is a proper solution anyway.
[05:19:20] <islalobo> Hello, I'm looking for help with colorbox jquery plugin
[05:19:59] <FruityLoops> My idea was to enclose the four columns in a div.
[05:20:07] <Omar-> FruityLoops maxWidth= $("#box4").offset().left + $("#box4").width();
[05:20:12] <FruityLoops> and then expand them for the width of that.
[05:21:09] <Omar-> or .outerWidth() to include padding
[05:22:01] <op_test221> hi guys, can anybody point me in the right direction, i googled this but probably i'm not using the right words to describe my concern:  i want to link to this page, http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html   but inside the frame that loads from http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/  . does anybody know how to do that? i was thining of adding the parameters  ?frame=1 to the first link, and from the
[05:22:41] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Been trying the page change module - http://jsfiddle.net/CreativeWolf/64p45f9t/31/ - no luck - any pointers please?
[05:22:56] <Cork> op_test221: split the question from the back story, makes it much easier to answer the question
[05:23:40] <op_test221> cork: true
[05:24:00] <Cork> also are you sure you meant to ask in this channel?
[05:24:46] <FruityLoops> I will try that thanks.
[05:25:08] <op_test221> Cork: well, ..where else should i go.
[05:25:19] <op_test221> If i can do it with jquery, why not
[05:25:24] <Cork> op_test221: a channel for elixir?
[05:25:42] <Cork> but ya, was very hard to follow what you exactly asked about so...
[05:25:51] <op_test221> Cork: sorry but you clearly did not understand my question
[05:25:52] <__john_doe__> okay, did anyone faced issue with firefox key events on tablet? keypress is not firing, unless u press spacebar before that?
[05:25:52] <Xatenev> He just wanna links pages with jquery actually Cork
[05:26:02] <Xatenev> @Cork: he isnt doing anything with elixir
[05:26:04] <Xatenev> hes just linking to the page
[05:26:09] <Xatenev> from what I've understood
[05:26:25] <op_test221> now that i am thinking, i want to update src in frame, when the pages gets loaded
[05:26:52] <Cork> when the parent page or the page inside the iframe?
[05:26:52] <op_test221> i was thiking of emulating a click or reloading the contents of frame...
[05:27:10] <op_test221> no iframe
[05:27:35] <op_test221> initial link is: http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html?load_in_frame=1
[05:27:36] <Cork> so when the iframe is finished loading you want to redirect it to a new url?
[05:27:58] <Cork> why do you need this?
[05:28:04] <Cork> sounds strange
[05:28:50] <op_test221> because i want to deal with links that people have used in the website
[05:29:13] <op_test221> but i want them to be loaded in the frame, because the elixir documentation uses that
[05:29:33] <Cork> uh
[05:29:52] <op_test221> but it is not a good approach i see, because the page will load, and then redirect again, beacuse it's a github page
[05:30:09] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[05:30:21] <Cork> you want to force the frame to load before links work?
[05:30:23] <Omar-> CreativeWolf i'll check it
[05:30:55] <op_test221> I want to load the page inside the frame, how do i link to that
[05:31:17] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Thanks :)
[05:31:22] <Omar-> CreativeWolf data.prevPage[0].id == "login" without "#" hash
[05:31:30] <Cork> op_test221: if you want an <a> tag to load the link in an iframe use target
[05:31:34] <reynierpm> Omar you still here?
[05:31:46] <op_test221> let's say you go to  and http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/ and click on Agent, how do i link to that?
[05:32:23] <op_test221> Cork: it's not iframe, just frameset/frame
[05:32:35] <Cork> op_test221: <a target="main" src="">
[05:32:36] <parapa> Hello
[05:32:47] <parapa> can someone help me with a datatables problem?
[05:32:55] <parapa> I have some undefined cells
[05:32:55] <Cork> ?ask @ parapa
[05:32:55] <b-ot> parapa: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:33:11] <op_test221> Cork: how do i create a direct link to that from another web site
[05:33:29] <Cork> ah, now we're starting to get into interesting parts :)
[05:33:32] <Cork> op_test221: you can't
[05:33:43] <Cork> unless the server has explicit support for it
[05:34:02] <op_test221> well, i think i can with just javascript, but i need to load the page twice.
[05:34:21] <Cork> ya
[05:34:32] <Cork> as the first page has to load for the js to be able to do anything
[05:34:33] <op_test221> is there a way to do a check of the url with javascript as soon as the page is loaded, and direct ?
[05:34:38] <Cork> hence the server comment
[05:34:52] <Cork> op_test221: you have to load the first page before the js is loaded
[05:34:53] <Cork> so no
[05:35:02] <op_test221> ;-(
[05:35:17] <Cork> op_test221: frames is a really old solution
[05:35:24] <Cork> and ya, it has loads of problem
[05:35:33] <Cork> and is why most don't use it anymore
[05:35:35] <parapa> I have some undefined cells in a datatable and it gives me this error: DataTables warning: table id=DataTables_Table_0 - Requested unknown parameter '17' for row 0. For more information about this error, please see http://datatables.net/tn/4  I am trying to fix it with the columns.DefaultContent but its not working, any help?
[05:35:45] <op_test221> we are trying to get rid of it, but it's not easy job
[05:36:11] <Cork> op_test221: now days it is normally handled by full page rendering
[05:36:21] <Cork> where the server merges the different partials into one big page
[05:36:37] <Cork> and to do page changes you do ajax calls (and update the url in the browser)
[05:36:58] <op_test221> yeah.. this is different story
[05:37:02] <Cork> the full page support is important to make direct linking work
[05:37:13] <Cork> op_test221: not really
[05:37:17] <op_test221> it's for project documentations, so it's plain html, that has to run in file://
[05:37:24] <Cork> ah
[05:37:31] <op_test221> you cannot do ajax when you have that.
[05:37:38] <Cork> should have mentioned that from the start ^^'
[05:37:48] <op_test221> that frame on the left, is heavy as
[05:37:54] <FruityLoops> Omar: I figured it out. I had to take away the space before the target box also, like $("#box4").offset().left + $("#box4").width() - $("#box1").offset().left
[05:38:04] <Cork> running from file adds a ton of extra restrictions
[05:38:11] <DRSK> Is there any way I can add a "gaussian blur" to images on scroll? Right now I'm fading in a hidden (blurred) image on top of the original. However this isn't the desired result as I'd rather blur "the" original instead. Ideas? Filter: blur() is out of the question as it doesn't work very well.
[05:38:22] <op_test221> so the idea is to create the menu in json, load it in every page separately, but i haven't had the time to do that.
[05:38:38] <FruityLoops> So cool that you can do that with Jquery. So cool that it's aligned just so. I should have read through the docs to find that. Thanks again you're very kind.
[05:38:54] <FruityLoops> I'm sure I'll be back again.
[05:39:03] <Cork> op_test221: was years since is used frames, but you might be able to dynamically set the url of the "main" frame from the parent page
[05:39:07] <op_test221> Cork: no worries, it's not a big deal.
[05:39:12] <Cork> and through that do the linking
[05:39:46] <op_test221> yes. but it has to be easy for people to remember.
[05:39:52] <Cork> like document.main.src = window.location.hash.replace(/#/, '')
[05:40:05] <op_test221> maybe replace http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html with http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/?Kernel.SpecialForms.html
[05:40:28] <Cork> #!/path is quite common syntax
[05:40:38] <Cork> twitter has used it for ages for example
[05:40:46] <op_test221> http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/#!Kernel.SpecialForms.html
[05:40:51] <op_test221> like that?
[05:40:54] <Cork> yes
[05:40:59] <op_test221> that's cool
[05:41:09] <Cork> and then strip #! from window.location.hash
[05:41:17] <Cork> and you have the "real" url
[05:41:25] <op_test221> beautiful solution
[05:44:46] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Changed that, Still the same...
[05:49:13] <Omar-> CreativeWolf what are you exactly doing?

[06:29:39] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to load a div in a hidden region programatically in a colorbox: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b659ea8a64052775296f
[06:29:52] <islalobo> I was calling it on a click function, but now I'm trying something different
[06:30:03] <islalobo> I'm not sure how to trigger the div to load in this case
[06:30:13] <alaing> basically in the column heading I'm going to replace the column name with a checkbox which when you click it, should check all the check boxes in that column
[06:30:43] <alaing> now I know how to do this for a single column but thats not to say theres another column like col3
[06:31:45] <DRSK> What preventions can I do towards Safari so when changing opacity from 0 to 1 it isn't sluggish? I've stored the images to change CSS so it's not the lookup that is adding the lag; what else can I do?
[06:32:39] <DRSK> Although looking it up each iteration with $( 'elem' ) does "add to" the lag
[06:32:55] <DRSK> So I guess it got better but it's still way to heavy for whatever reasons
[06:33:47] <alaing> DRSK: coudl you post some code?
[06:34:07] <alaing> DRSK:  maybe you need to refactor it or cache more elements
[06:34:11] <kpl> In jq mobile we need to call .checkboxradio("refresh") after setting checked prop. What do we need need to call after setting val of a select?
[06:34:46] <DRSK> It wouldn't make much sense though but basically what I'm doing is using scrollMagic and TweenMax to change opacity from 0 to 1 on 4 <img> elements. Reducing it to "one" element does help but it's still sluggish.
[06:36:41] <DRSK> alaing » in chrome it's just "the first time" then it's smooth. In Safari however it's lagging all the way all the time. I can PM an example if you'd like to see for yourself and perhaps give some ideas on how I can improve the performance?
[06:37:03] <alaing> DRSK: ok pm me
[06:37:54] <alaing> any ideas how i dynamically get all column indexes which have a checkbox with the class of "check-all" http://codepen.io/aliuk2012/pen/QwqGBj
[06:39:40] <joroci> you mean the index of col1 or col2 or col3?
[06:39:44] <sagittarian> hey does anyone know where/if i can find the event listeners that have been registered through jquery (for a given event and dom node)?
[06:39:59] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/dakunogiza/1/edit?html,js,console,output - how comes the change() function doesn't fire when I change an inputs checked attribute using .prop() ?
[06:40:46] <sagittarian> and also where/if i can find the event itself that jquery attaches to the node (that jquery uses to manage the events)
[06:41:29] <tlkr> hellier, it won't if you change it using prop, you can use .prop('checked', true).change()
[06:42:00] <hellier> Aye, thanks
[06:42:06] <hellier> just stumbled across that, .trigger("change") :P
[06:42:09] <hellier> that seems to work
[06:42:15] <tlkr> :)
[06:45:17] <islalobo> Trying to get this colorbox to load: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/98d9a8bc4cbb1d55dbf0
[06:53:16] <alaing> any ideas how i dynamically get all column indexes which have a checkbox with the class of "check-all" http://codepen.io/aliuk2012/pen/QwqGBj
[06:54:47] <sagittarian> alaing, what do you mean by column index?
[06:55:32] <op_test221> Cork?
[06:55:44] <alaing> sagittarian: like column 1 (ie should return 0) and column 3(should return 2). index is zero based of course
[06:56:02] <sagittarian> is this an html table?
[06:56:26] <op_test221> I have done the redirect thing, the other thing that i would like to do is.. update the url in the address bar, when people click on the left frame.... any idea how to do that?
[06:56:43] <gnarf_> alaing: you have a bunch of rows and columns there
[06:56:53] <gnarf_> alaing: how do you want that data?
[06:57:52] <alaing> gnarf_: basically what i want to do is get an array of column index that have those checkboxes.
[06:58:19] <gnarf_> alaing: okay - are there any table cells with colspan?
[06:58:31] <gnarf_> and you just want to know >if< it has the checkbox?
[06:58:38] <alaing> I;m then going to replace the relevant th so they contain a checkbox which will check all the checkboxes in that column
[06:58:46] <alaing> no colspans
[06:59:03] <gnarf_> alaing: $singleCheckbox.closest('td').index()
[06:59:04] <alaing> I got it working for 1 column
[06:59:16] <gnarf_> `api index @alaing
[06:59:16] <b-ot> alaing: .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:59:25] <alaing> yip i tknow that one
[06:59:57] <alaing> what i dont want to do is go through all the checkboxes to find there column indexs
[07:00:24] <sagittarian> alaing, use jquery to find your checkboxes, then use $.map to map in to indexes
[07:00:38] <gnarf_> alaing: you could also go through all the columns too
[07:00:51] <sagittarian> then use $.unique to remove duplicates
[07:01:48] <gnarf_> $table.find('td:nth-child(1) .check-all').length would tell you if there are any check alls in the 0th column
[07:01:57] <gnarf_> but it's 1 based index for nth-child
[07:03:33] <gnarf> sagittarian: $.unique only works on dom elements fyi
[07:03:48] <gnarf> sagittarian: it >might< work on strings, but it's only meant to work on dom elements
[07:03:50] <sagittarian> gnarf: that's what i thought, but i just tried it and it works on integers
[07:04:16] <sagittarian> if it doesn't work for you, you'll have to switch to lodash, which is what you should be using in the first place
[07:04:51] <gnarf> alaing: can you like describe what you actually want? :)
[07:05:04] <gnarf> alaing: what output do you want on your pen??
[07:05:56] <alaing> I;m looking to dynamically replace the column headings with a checkbox. The new checkbox will select all checkboxes in that column
[07:06:01] <gnarf> alaing: okay
[07:06:07] <gnarf> alaing: are all rows the same template?
[07:06:18] <alaing> hold on just attemptting the $.map
[07:06:29] <alaing> yes its a report
[07:06:38] <gnarf> alaing: restrict the map to the first td then
[07:06:39] <gnarf> for perf
[07:06:40] <gnarf> so like
[07:07:05] <alaing> dont you mean tr?
[07:07:15] <alaing> second tr :-)
[07:07:33] <gnarf> $("table tbody tr").find('.check-all').map(funciton() { return $(this).closest('td').index(); });.get()
[07:07:41] <gnarf> oh
[07:07:58] <gnarf> a) i forgot to .first
[07:08:10] <gnarf> and why aren't you using a <thead> for your table heading?
[07:08:12] <gnarf> itll help
[07:08:23] <gnarf> so you can .first() on that tr selector
[07:08:34] <gnarf> otherwise you could .eq(1) also
[07:08:41] <gnarf> to get "the second"
[07:09:07] <alaing> http://codepen.io/aliuk2012/pen/QwqGBj
[07:09:53] <gnarf> alaing: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bNoBXV
[07:10:19] <alaing> actually I like your idea on the first row check instead of going through the whole table.....
[07:10:37] <gnarf> alaing: $.map( array, iterator )
[07:10:50] <gnarf> alaing: but jQuery collections have a .map() that you can call directoy
[07:10:55] <gnarf> directly*
[07:11:01] <gnarf> just pass iterator
[07:12:54] <centrx> There seems to be no source code on the API documentation?
[07:12:57] <gnarf> alaing: using the .get() after the map converts it back from a "jQuery collection" to a "plain array"
[07:13:15] <alaing> I was justa bout to ask you that
[07:13:19] <alaing> thanks for your help
[07:13:25] <alaing> very much appreciated
[07:13:29] <gnarf> centrx: like examples? there are examples for most of the api's on the site
[07:13:42] <gnarf> centrx: is there an implementation of something you'd like help finding?
[07:13:42] <alaing> api,jquery.com
[07:13:57] <gnarf> `api .get @alaing
[07:13:58] <b-ot> alaing: No matches.

[07:14:50] <tonph> hey, just need an info - https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/, I  was looking at this in search of a big file uploader with any file types. Is this framework the right choice
[07:15:08] <tonph> I also need folder upload support to and better MIT license.
[07:15:11] <gnarf> tonph: file upload very much depends on your server side
[07:15:33] <gnarf> tonph: doubt you'll get "folder support"
[07:15:43] <gnarf> best uploader I used in the past was "plupload"
[07:15:54] <gnarf> its been a year or two since i looked into it tho
[07:16:02] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Sounds adorably.
[07:16:06] <alaing> i second plupload
[07:16:06] <BillCriswell> adorable*
[07:16:21] <BillCriswell> pupload would be cuter.
[07:16:32] <gnarf> +1
[07:16:44] <tonph> anny suggestion for the best framework as such .. I need an MIT license or Apache..
[07:17:05] <BillCriswell> tonph: Need to be way more specific.
[07:17:21] <tonph> BillChriswell: Folder upload is supported in this ?
[07:17:25] <gnarf> sorry - plupload is GPLv2 but like - its the best
[07:17:35] <BillCriswell> tonph: I have no idea haha.
[07:17:36] <gnarf> tonph: nothing supports "folder upload" just "multiple files"
[07:17:50] <gnarf> tonph: there is no way to "select a folder" and upload everything in it
[07:17:52] <gnarf> no way
[07:17:54] <gnarf> flash
[07:17:58] <gnarf> use flash
[07:18:00] <gnarf> or give up
[07:18:13] <gnarf> (plupload uses flash/silverlight/etc whatever is best to support it)
[07:18:31] <gnarf> or can fall back to pure html5
[07:18:38] <tonph> gnarf: Still is there a way such that Choosing a folder is supported and it simply extends to all the files and paths and uploads one by one ....
[07:18:41] <gnarf> but multiple file uploads in general are really hard to support
[07:18:49] <gnarf> tonph: no
[07:18:54] <gnarf> tonph: there is no way like that
[07:19:14] <gnarf> tonph: without asking your users to zip the folder, or writing some "not javascript" code to do it
[07:19:30] <tonph> gnarf: k ... that means I got to resort to applet like stuffs..
[07:19:54] <gnarf> tonph: yes, and plupload takes care of a bunch of it.... but flash and silverlight are both good means of handling it
[07:20:21] <gnarf> either way, each file is uploaded "one by one" and you need a bunch of server and client side code to keep the upload "in sync"
[07:21:06] <gnarf> one of the magic things in plupload is "file chunking" to make huge files into smaller parts of a big file
[07:21:16] <tonph> gnarf: ok .. thats is nice info... so let me try make the applet to just simple select the file/folder at once and upload the files one by one using the javascript. My requirement is something like that..
[07:21:17] <gnarf> so they can get past your servers POST body limitations
[07:23:03] <tonph> gnarf: can u please suggest if any other framework like pupload ... but with MIT license.
[07:23:19] <NoiseEee> chrome does it
[07:23:34] <NoiseEee> sorry bad scrollin
[07:23:50] <logikos> I have a list of testimonials in a box, each with its own class, I want to loop though and display them one at a time, auto switching ot a new one every 2 seconds or so fading from one to the next and just have it repeat
[07:24:09] <logikos> i could write somethign ot do this but i figure it probably already exists so... thought i'd ask first
[07:24:14] <gnarf> NoiseEee: folders?
[07:24:18] <gnarf> NoiseEee: no way....
[07:24:21] <logikos> seems i'm not picking the right keywords to search in google lol
[07:24:28] <NoiseEee> logikos: imo, those testimonials should be a JS object, and you just load them into the "box"/"div" every x seconds
[07:24:45] <NoiseEee> logikos: single box, collection of testimonials in an object to be retreived as you wish
[07:24:50] <NoiseEee> gnarf: from what i understand...
[07:25:17] <NoiseEee> openWebLOL of course
[07:33:19] <DRSK> https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js <-- so I'm looking at that and wondering after init how could I say run a method of the plugin such as yourOtherFunction? Ideally I'd like to do $( 'elem' ).pluginName(); and at a later stage invoke a method such as 'next'; but not exactly sure how to do that.
[07:33:24] <DRSK> Anyone able to take a look and give me a hint?
[07:34:16] <jennmoneydollars> bann
[07:34:27] <jennmoneydollars> oh woops he’s not in here
[07:34:37] <xec> DRSK: you could store a reference to [some object] on the DOM element using .data()
[07:34:50] <DRSK> xec » isn't it already doing that at line 56?
[07:35:09] <xec> DRSK: ah true
[07:35:27] <DRSK> meaning if I sort of give it an option such as myFunc: but yeah I kinda loose track there. I'd want to call "next" on the element of which the plugin has been initiated on
[07:35:32] <DRSK> and prev() ^^
[07:35:41] <xec> DRSK: then you should be able to access it with $( 'elem' ).data('plugin_pluginName').next()
[07:35:51] <DRSK> ohh nothing else needed?
[07:36:09] <xec> assuming there is a method named "next" of course
[07:36:19] <DRSK> Ah yeah I will make sure there is ;) Thanks m8
[07:51:12] <kpl> jQ Mobile: inputs seem to stretch to fill page width. I'd like the input for a date and time to fit the width of the date/time or be able to set a fixed width. How?
[07:56:27] <tlkr> kpl, max-width ?
[08:02:12] <negusnegesti> Hello guys, hope you're well.
[08:02:12] <negusnegesti> A question, please. Is it possible to obtain values from a jquery var in php without using ajax?
[08:03:13] <Xatenev> Heya
[08:03:20] <Xatenev> is there a way to call a function every 2nd onChange? :D
[08:03:25] <ThePendulum> I've got this cute little line here; $('body').scrollTop($('body')[0].scrollHeight);
[08:03:38] <ThePendulum> It should scroll down whenever the content of the page overflows, and it does so nicely in Chrome
[08:03:42] <ThePendulum> But apparently not in FireFox.
[08:03:58] <Xatenev> firefox > console
[08:03:59] <Xatenev> output?
[08:04:27] <ThePendulum> Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[08:04:31] <ThePendulum> that's the only thing in there
[08:04:39] <ThePendulum> I'm not even sure what it's refering to tbh
[08:04:41] <Xatenev> its prbably cause firefox places overflow at html
[08:04:46] <Xatenev> and not @body level
[08:04:52] <Xatenev> try $('body,html').whatever
[08:05:02] <Xatenev> instead of $('body'
[08:06:07] <ThePendulum> it hmm, not quite helping
[08:06:08] <Xatenev> ThePendulum: Tell me if it worked, im excitedly :P
[08:06:12] <Xatenev> Damn
[08:06:21] <Xatenev> Thought so, cause I read exactly the same question on SO these days
[08:06:22] <Xatenev> =p
[08:06:34] <Xatenev> let me search it, maybe u can copy it
[08:06:46] <Xatenev> ThePendulum:
[08:06:46] <Xatenev> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8149155/animate-scrolltop-not-working-in-firefox
[08:06:49] <ThePendulum> hold on!
[08:06:56] <ThePendulum> I only changed the broadcast scroll
[08:06:58] <ThePendulum> not the chat scroll
[08:07:03] <ThePendulum> let me update that and see if that works
[08:07:31] <ThePendulum> nope D:
[08:07:58] <Xatenev> damn
[08:07:58] <Xatenev> :p
[08:08:04] <ThePendulum> let me check that link
[08:08:32] <Xatenev> hes using .animate()
[08:08:33] <Xatenev> maybe it owrks then
[08:09:14] <kpl> tlkr: For some reason it seems I cannot set max-width, and .css("max-width" returns "none"
[08:09:38] <kpl> tlkr: .css("min-width" returns "0px"
[08:10:40] <tlkr> ThePendulum, I use $('iframe').height($('iframe').contents().find('body').prop('scrollHeight')); on an page of mine and it works cross browser
[08:11:06] <tlkr> it may translate
[08:12:42] <tlkr> ah wait, maybe I've read it totally wrong (Y)
[08:12:43] <kpl> tlkr: I can do .css("width","50") and I can see the value being updated in the debugger (visual studio), and I can do .css("height","30") and see height being added
[08:13:17] <kpl> tlkr: but max-width seems not to be supported, as nothing happens
[08:13:26] <Tawre> hey is there some easy way to do alphabetical sorting in js?
[08:13:42] <tlkr> kpl, width: 100%, max-width: 300px ?
[08:13:56] <ThePendulum> scrolling works in FireFox now
[08:14:03] <ThePendulum> thanks to what Xatenev mentioned at body,html
[08:14:07] <ThePendulum> I applied it to the wrong bit of the code
[08:14:16] <ThePendulum> now there is a slight offset between Chrome and firefox though, pity
[08:14:38] <ThePendulum> rather, the input box at the bottom is slightly larger in Firefox hence it overlaps with the chat itself more
[08:14:40] <Xatenev> ThePendulum: nice that it works
[08:14:47] <ThePendulum> I should just increase the margin a little
[08:14:52] <ThePendulum> Xatenev: yeah, thanks a lot, glad someone pointed it out
[08:16:12] <kpl> tlkr: after width 100%, I can set max-width, but it affects the text inside the input and not the input width itself (jQ Mobile)
[08:17:59] <kpl> tlkr: OK, now I got it, I need to set the max-width of the parent of the input, the jqmobile ui-input
[08:25:22] <negusnegesti> Another question please: is it possible to set "get" via javascript before submitting a form with method=get?
[08:27:30] <gnarf> negusnegesti you can add a hidden input to the form in its "submit" handler
[08:27:37] <gnarf> or alter
[08:28:55] <Meir`> Tawre : what are you trying to sort? an array?
[08:29:12] <Tawre> Meir`, already got it thanks
[08:29:15] <Tawre> there's array.sort
[08:30:14] <Meir`> negusnegesti, about your first question:
[08:30:18] <samssh> What would be the opposite of .wrapInner()?
[08:30:18] <Meir`>  <negusnegesti> A question, please. Is it possible to obtain values from a jquery var in php without using ajax?
[08:30:42] <Meir`> negusnegesti, no, you have to send it to server first
[08:31:11] <CssNoob> Does parallax scrolling on trend?
[08:31:17] <goddard> can I ask jquery mobile questions here about design?
[08:31:36] <Meir`> samssh, what do u mean by opposite?
[08:31:45] <Meir`> remove the inner first wrapping tag?
[08:31:56] <goddard> basically i just want to know if there is an easy way to punch in iamges for certain sizes and have them be responsive CSS generated
[08:33:23] <samssh> Meir`, Pretty much. Remove the child, but leave the child's children in place.
[08:35:02] <Meir`> samssh: you mean to turn: <section><div><p>Text</p></div></section> into: <section><p>Text</p></section> ?
[08:35:11] <Meir`> for example
[08:35:18] <samssh> YEs. I think I can cobble together a couple jquery methods to get that to happen,
[08:35:39] <Meir`> indeed, you need to manipulate html() of the parent
[08:35:43] <samssh> But I'm hoping to find the less verbose method.
[08:35:56] <Meir`> you can do it in one line, i think
[08:37:27] <Meir`> samssh, and there's also .unwrap()
[08:37:54] <Meir`> in the case above: $("p").unwrap();
[08:38:04] <samssh> That's what I'm looking at. Dropping down two levels from the original, and calling unwrap().
[08:38:54] <Meir`> please provide some fiddle, i want to see the html structure
[08:39:36] <samssh> Have to give me a minute.
[08:40:05] <Meir`> goddard : u wish to play with the img width and height? or you have different sizes hosted on your server
[08:41:37] <negusnegesti> Meir`:  THX!
[08:42:07] <Meir`> negusnegesti np
[08:42:29] <samssh> Meir`, This is the html before manipulation. http://jsbin.com/dukiwolawu/1/edit
[08:42:44] <Meir`> if you want to provide more info, maybe we'll think about a way that doesn't require passing the var
[08:43:20] <Meir`> samssh, ok, and which wrapper you want to kill?
[08:43:51] <samssh> Meir`, The intent is to wrap the children of .panel-body with a form, then pull it off after submition.
[08:44:08] <samssh> Obviously with more going on in between.
[08:44:50] <Meir`> so you need to turn the <dd> tags into <input type="text"> ?
[08:45:39] <samssh> I'll be doing something slightly more complex than that, but with the same purpose. I know what I'm doing there though.
[08:46:07] <Meir`> you get this html from another source?
[08:46:17] <Meir`> in this pattern?
[08:46:42] <samssh> No, this is my source. This is actually the result of a twig template.
[08:47:44] <Omar-> CreativeWolf have you got it working?
[08:48:34] <Meir`> samssh, well, i'm not familiar with Twig, but I think best practice will load the html as form in server side
[08:48:47] <Meir`> but let's try the way you need it
[08:49:28] <samssh> The page is doubling as a show profile and edit profile page.
[08:50:30] <samssh> JS is already a requirement, and faster than reloading the page for exactly the same content wrapped in a form.
[08:50:32] <NoiseEee> samssh: you should google for 'edit in place' type functionality
[08:51:21] <Meir`> NoiseEee, do you mean contenteditable="true"?
[08:51:33] <NoiseEee> not exactly
[08:52:06] <samssh> I'm just looking for a better solution than $(".panel-body").children().children()[0].unwrap();
[08:52:59] <robertmaxrees> .find() might serve you well there, but an edit-in-place library/plugin might be really night here.
[08:53:26] <NoiseEee> also do yourself a favor and class up your elements
[08:53:48] <NoiseEee> make things easy to find
[08:53:49] <samssh> NoiseEee, That code is just to show the structure.
[08:53:58] <samssh> Not exactly final form.
[08:54:21] <NoiseEee> okay, well i still say edit-in-place is the way to go / or do a quick script to change <dd> tags into <inputs> with the value.
[08:54:36] <NoiseEee> (which is what edit-in-place is anyhow)
[08:54:51] <samssh> NoiseEee, That's what I'm going to do.
[08:55:05] <NoiseEee> sweet then, good luck
[08:55:30] <samssh> Although, I'm going to inset the inputs as children to the <dd>s. Can't be breaking semantics...
[08:56:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd do whatever the lib wants as far as that's concerned.
[08:58:28] <samssh> I'm suprised there isn't a jquery method that removes the selected element while leaving it's contents alone.
[08:58:35] <Meir`> samssh, unwrap() is not the only think you need
[08:58:58] <Meir`> that's what i suggested according to the first info you provided
[08:59:03] <Meir`> thing*
[08:59:48] <robertmaxrees> nah, people get really confused over all kinds of other DOM operations.  that might be a helpful plugin though.
[09:00:14] <samssh> Meir`, I'm not sure what you are saying.
[09:00:44] <Meir`> samssh, which tag you want to unwrap?
[09:01:02] <goddard> Meir` i have different sized images
[09:01:26] <Meir`> goddard, then that makes the whole responsive thing tricky
[09:01:46] <Meir`> google for: jquery responsive image
[09:02:03] <Meir`> there are some plugins and implementions to solve this
[09:02:38] <samssh> Meir`, I updated the fiddle, http://jsbin.com/dukiwolawu/1/edit
[09:03:32] <samssh> What I'd really like to do is remove the form, from having selected the .panel-body (which will be selected from a semantic class), while leaving the form content as .panle-body content.
[09:03:56] <samssh> Without using a long string such as $(".panel-body").children().children()[0].unwrap();
[09:04:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you selecting with that children().children()[0] ?
[09:04:29] <robertmaxrees> the h2?
[09:04:50] <samssh> Doesn't matter, because it just needs to be child of the form, so that the form element can be unwrapped.
[09:05:00] <NoiseEee> good luck.
[09:05:25] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to remove the form element but maintain its children, right?
[09:05:26] <samssh> Actually, I can get the form element directly on submition, so I don't need one of those children() calls.
[09:05:32] <samssh> robertmaxrees, Yes
[09:07:01] <samssh> But I still see $form.children()[0].unwrap().
[09:07:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:07:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[09:07:41] <samssh> It just seems convulted that I can't call $form.removeInPlace() (I'm bad at naming) or something.
[09:07:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not - that's an overly implicit concept.
[09:07:59] <robertmaxrees> and would really confuse people.
[09:08:17] <samssh> Hmmm.
[09:08:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/roquxacive/1/edit you could do this instead.
[09:08:41] <samssh> So is $form.children()[0].unwrap() pretty much it?
[09:08:49] <robertmaxrees> look at what i just gave you.
[09:09:24] <robertmaxrees> the danger of .children()[0] is that's relying on an ephemeral ordering of things.  what i gave you explicitly targets the element you want to remove.
[09:10:07] <samssh> I think... That's pretty much exactly what I was looking for.
[09:12:52] <Meir`> while i made perhaps less pretty: http://jsbin.com/surolodiga/1/edit
[09:13:08] <robertmaxrees> that does basically the same thing :)
[09:13:50] <Meir`> now it's one line
[09:13:53] <Meir`> $(".panel-body").html($(".panel-body form").html());
[09:13:57] <Meir`> ;)
[09:14:22] <robertmaxrees> and not clear what it's doing :)
[09:14:43] <NoiseEee> exactly
[09:14:44] <NoiseEee> lol
[09:14:57] <NoiseEee> +1 if you're into a death wish by whoever succeeds you
[09:15:02] <robertmaxrees> ++++
[09:15:19] <Meir`> +10

[09:15:43] <robertmaxrees> all day every day
[09:16:27] <Meir`> i consider .html() as readable
[09:16:30] <Meir`> :P
[09:16:43] <samssh> Yeah, I like robertmaxrees's solution a bit better. I think Meir`'s is what I would have come up with, and it has another fault in that it needs to select the form's parent, while robertmaxrees's only operates on the form.
[09:17:02] <Meir`> sets parent html to be parent's child html
[09:17:07] <robertmaxrees> Meir` it's the double calls to .html() - it's not immediately apaprent what you're trying to do or why.
[09:17:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's fine it you can read it, but the next dev might not catch on so quickly.
[09:18:13] <Meir`> samssh, beware that's robertmaxrees selects the parent too
[09:18:25] <robertmaxrees> I do?
[09:18:45] <Meir`> oh, now i see what he meant
[09:18:47] <Meir`> never mind
[09:18:53] <robertmaxrees> haha
[09:18:55] * Meir` gives in
[09:19:29] <samssh> Thanks guys
[09:21:25] <t4nk561> Hi, how does one know when to put functions or anything else inside the "$(document).on('ready', function () {" and when outside ?
[09:21:49] <robertmaxrees> t4nk561 easy - does the code get called on pageload and, if so, does it reference elements on the page?
[09:21:56] <robertmaxrees> finally, is your code in the <head> of your page?
[09:22:33] <t4nk561> I got mine included at the footer
[09:22:40] <t4nk561> as google page insight advices to do so
[09:22:52] <robertmaxrees> if your code is after all your html, you don't really need a document ready call.
[09:23:08] <t4nk561> Ahh okay, that's interesting
[09:23:26] <t4nk561> It's pretty much at the bottom
[09:23:41] <robertmaxrees> is it after all the html you'd try to interact with?
[09:24:05] <t4nk561> Yes fairly much
[09:24:42] <robertmaxrees> as long as you don't need to interact with anything after your code, you're basically OK without a document ready
[09:25:00] <t4nk561> okay, I will try - thanks!
[09:25:54] <Meir`> t4nk561, maybe it'll help you if you treat <script> as another tag in the html page
[09:26:12] <Meir`> so if it's written after <div> and <table>, it must "know" them
[09:26:24] <t4nk561> I see
[09:26:31] <t4nk561> it does know them as far as I know
[09:28:41] <funkt> http://www.owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/demos/images.html Hi there I am after a carousel where I can add div content I quite like this solution but it does not loop back to the first image instead it waits till the end and spins back to the start does anyone know a of solution where I could a carousel to loop round to the start div?
[09:29:12] <Jattenalle> funkt, http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[09:29:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:29:55] <funkt> I couldnt agree with you more unfortunately I dont have another option
[09:30:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink whether or not you need one.  if you really do, find a plugin that actually does what you need.
[09:30:26] <funkt> I have looked all I am after is a script jsfiddle to do what I am after
[09:30:38] <Jattenalle> http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/carousel/ *shrugs*
[09:30:41] <Jattenalle> try one of those
[09:30:42] <funkt> I have looked and I do not really want to use a plugin
[09:30:54] <robertmaxrees> you linked to a plugin though...
[09:31:29] <Tawre> i have an array that says the length of it is 72 objects
[09:31:37] <Tawre> oh nvm
[09:31:38] <funkt> Well I was going to integrate strip the whole thing down and then place it in only using certain parts I needed
[09:31:49] <Tawre> dont optimize when it's not necessary!
[09:31:54] <Jattenalle> ^^
[09:32:02] <Jattenalle> pre-emptive optimization is bad
[09:32:52] <funkt> Just wondered if anyone here may have stumbled on a script or jsfiddle something very simple where it does not retract to the start but instead loops round continously
[09:33:03] <Jattenalle> funkt, i linked you several
[09:33:21] <choosegoose> is there a version of .data('foo') that returns something like "null" instead of undefined when there is no set value?
[09:33:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:33:42] <Jattenalle> funkt, even Owl does what you want, if you had a look at the documentation..
[09:33:51] <robertmaxrees> why do you want null instead?  null is coercively equal to undefined, and both are falsy anyway
[09:34:24] <Jattenalle> choosegoose, var value = .data('foo') || NULL;
[09:34:27] <Jattenalle> enjoy bad code
[09:34:52] <Jattenalle> you can also do it with an inline if
[09:34:56] <funkt> Jattenalle where?
[09:35:04] <Jattenalle> funkt, http://www.owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/index.html#customizing ?
[09:35:16] <choosegoose> if I pass undefined in $.ajax, what is it actually? I guess that would be up to Django?
[09:35:24] <choosegoose> (in my case)
[09:35:36] <Jattenalle> choosegoose, pass undefined as the URI?
[09:35:42] <Jattenalle> it will just fail
[09:35:43] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose depends on how you're "passing" it.
[09:35:44] <choosegoose> no, as a data value
[09:35:50] <Jattenalle> it will just ignore it
[09:36:00] <choosegoose> data: {'foo', $('...').data('foo')}
[09:36:04] <Jattenalle> it's exactly the same as if there was no variable at all there
[09:36:09] <Jattenalle> so it's all good
[09:36:12] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:36:13] <Jattenalle> leave it as undefined
[09:36:22] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't sound right to me.
[09:36:41] <funkt> Where does it say Jattenalle that it will stop the rewind and loop? I did see the documentation but I cannot see the stop rewind and loop instead which function can you see which would do this?
[09:36:54] <Jattenalle> funkt, rewindNav
[09:37:05] <Jattenalle> defaults to true, try changing it to false
[09:37:30] <choosegoose> er, 'foo' :
[09:37:35] <funkt> superb!!! Thank you very much! I  will try that!
[09:37:43] <funkt> Cheers for your help!
[09:38:23] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose you might get 'undefined' (the string) as the value for that prop.
[09:38:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd test is though.
[09:38:30] <Jattenalle> choosegoose, data: { 'foo': .data('foo')}, assuming .data is not defined, is the same as: data{ 'foo': undefined} which is the same as: data{}
[09:38:34] <choosegoose> thanks
[09:38:53] <Jattenalle> it works fine, it works as expected, just check
[09:38:54] <choosegoose> I meant 'data' : {...}
[09:39:03] <choosegoose> er
[09:39:04] <Jattenalle> if(data.foo){ do stuff }
[09:39:04] <choosegoose> I see
[09:39:16] <Jattenalle> if .foo is undefined or null, same behaviour
[09:39:17] <choosegoose> I will check
[09:44:46] <CssNoob> anyone here working or using angularJS?
[09:46:45] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ CssNoob
[09:46:46] <b-ot> CssNoob: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:49:26] <CssNoob> fuq bot lol
[09:49:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:50:09] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask :) that was the gist there ;)
[10:12:02] <Omar-> Is there any way to add the variable into the jQuery command like this:
[10:12:13] <Omar-> var id = 10;
[10:12:13] <Omar-> var msg = CKEDITOR.instances.contentedit+id.getData();
[10:12:17] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[10:12:24] <robertmaxrees> Omar- huh?
[10:12:32] <Omar-> lol
[10:12:43] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use a variable in a selector?
[10:12:44] <Omar-> just saw a question on SO
[10:13:05] <Omar-> hi HikaruBG
[10:13:32] <Omar-> robertmaxrees the answer is var msg = CKEDITOR.instances["contentedit" + id].getData();
[10:13:59] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah - that's how you dinamically access properties on an object.
[10:14:18] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with jquery.
[10:14:46] <HikaruBG> I have a click event inside a div,on a child element and I need to capture all events, linked to this click event and append new task after everything have been done. The DIV is a container with dynamic content, meaning I need to basically intercept all click binds to it's children and after everything has been done to execute a function.
[10:15:14] <HikaruBG> anyone who knows how to add a function to an existing click events pipe?
[10:15:22] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:15:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a really hacky thing to do and it'll cause you headaches down the road.
[10:15:32] <HikaruBG> (or sequence)?
[10:16:16] <robertmaxrees> rethink the problem :)
[10:25:54] <Azrael_-> what was the library called for instant updates from the server?
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> Long Polling?
[10:32:04] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily a library, but that's the technique.
[10:33:18] <gtristan> and web sockets, but let's just stick with long polling, works well, no need to complicate things, or use any technique with a less perverted connotation
[10:34:33] <choosegoose> is it always a bad idea to have myelem.html($(data.content)) in the 'success' function of a $.ajax or is XSS mitigated somewhere in the process
[10:34:53] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose up to you to mitigate that risk.
[10:35:06] <choosegoose> is there a way that is usually done
[10:35:14] <robertmaxrees> server-side validation.
[10:35:28] <robertmaxrees> what are you shipping to the user?
[10:36:06] <robertmaxrees> like, is is content from other users?
[10:37:01] <choosegoose> the data.content will be produced from a template with only a simple string variable that is sent via the original $.ajax, I will escape that
[10:37:40] <robertmaxrees> are you accepting input from end users?
[10:38:38] <choosegoose> no, the $.ajax triggers on a button click. the user or attacker could change the attr in the DOM from which the $.ajax({data: ...}) gets the string, but I will escape that
[10:38:57] <islalobo> Hello, trying to get my colobox to close when the 'no thanks' button is clicked https://gist.github.com/anonymous/26a525c42a4dc5afa191
[10:39:08] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose make sure you're escaping server-side.
[10:39:25] <choosegoose> tes
[10:39:28] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[10:39:51] <choosegoose> yes; in my case |escape
[10:40:24] <robertmaxrees> or you can escape on input.
[10:40:25] <robertmaxrees> or both!
[10:52:07] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[10:52:12] * arthurvr feeling good today
[10:52:18] <arthurvr> what’s going on today?
[10:54:34] <Getty> arthurvr: death and pain, like every day
[10:54:45] <arthurvr> Getty: haha :-)
[10:55:02] <Getty> arthurvr: but you can tell me how i should make an ajax progressbar these days.... the jquery doc says nothing and the stackoverflow answer i found just doesnt work
[10:55:08] <Getty> i most have missed some memo
[10:55:12] <Getty> s/most/must/
[10:55:41] <arthurvr> to be honest, it must be possible, but nooo idea
[10:56:19] <Getty> yeah of course it must be possible, i dont remember that it was a problem in the past
[10:56:39] <Getty> but i feel like that the documentation i found on stackoverflow actually referes to legacy jquery or other around modern.,... what the hell do i actually have...
[10:57:21] <Getty> oh yeah i am old 1.11.1
[10:57:36] <arthurvr> old. That’s one version ago :)
[10:57:36] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty new.
[10:57:38] <Getty> then the thing on stackoverflow is probably for the new one
[10:57:45] <Getty> yeah well its not 2.x thats what i mean
[10:57:52] <arthurvr> but that’s not old
[10:57:55] <robertmaxrees> 2.x and 1.x share the same features.
[10:58:02] <robertmaxrees> 2.x only drops support for old IE.
[10:58:07] <Getty> yeah but something must be there why copying the stackoverflow solution doesnt work on me ;)
[10:58:19] <arthurvr> I mean 1.11.2 got released same time as 2.1.3 :)
[10:58:21] <HikaruBG> hey guys, does anyone knows how to execute a function after everything bind to a CLICK event has been done?
[10:58:41] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG put code after the binding.
[10:58:59] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('click', function() { /* some stuff */ }); someOtherFunction();
[11:01:16] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, this way the someOtherfunction() will execute once. I need it to run as the last function of the CLICK event every time it get's clicked. Only I have CLICK listeners to other elements in the same DIV, to which I have some slideUp() functions and the method ends up executed before the animation is over
[11:01:39] <HikaruBG> I need it to run AFTER the animation (slideUp()) is done
[11:02:44] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG then use the complete callback on the slideup.
[11:03:16] <robertmaxrees> $('div').slideUp('fast', function() { /* your code here */ })
[11:03:31] <robertmaxrees> or just $('div').slideUp('fast', someFunctionReference);
[11:28:00] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... quiet in here today.
[11:29:08] <robertmaxrees> i really, REALLY wish coldfusion had some decent array functions
[11:34:17] <aro> is there a good way to add things from one list to another with jquery?
[11:34:24] <aro> sortable/draggable doesnt seem to work very well
[11:34:57] <mdev> two comboboxes that have height so displays items
[11:35:07] <mdev> then 2 buttons in between to move back and forth
[11:35:21] <mdev> example
[11:35:34] <aro> well it needs to be able to display div elements
[11:35:44] <aro> and i need a way to move the items up and down in the list
[11:35:52] <mdev> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50354233/controls.png
[11:37:45] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: The same issue I faced with this "SSML" language I used.
[11:38:19] <BillCriswell> aro: Sortables?
[11:38:33] <aro> i used sortable right now, but it doesnt work very well
[11:39:04] <BillCriswell> What is giving you a hard time about it?
[11:39:32] <aro> well if you have a list that you have to scroll down to view or place the item, it places it in unpredictable places/multiple times
[11:39:47] <BillCriswell> aro: Ah.
[11:39:55] <aro> its quite frustrating
[11:41:33] <aro> is there a way to use linked lists in jquery without using draggable
[11:41:48] <BillCriswell> aro: Would refreshPositions help?
[11:41:56] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell right?!  like, it could be almost useful, but then....
[11:41:59] <aro> what does that do?
[11:42:21] <BillCriswell> It updates the cached position of sortable items.
[11:42:38] <aro> where does it say we have to use that? WHEN do we use it?
[11:43:06] <BillCriswell> It doesn't say you have to.
[11:44:03] <aro> when do we call it?
[11:45:15] <jbcfr1> hello. I have some code in the form of:  $el.attr('src', function() { ... using $(this).attr('other') ... } ).removeAttr( 'other' );  Is the callback in .attr() always expected to be executed before .removeAttr()?
[11:45:18] <BillCriswell> I would try calling it on every mousemove for starters. Then if that helps the situation throttle/debounce it a bit.
[11:45:32] <jbcfr1> aka can I always expect to have the value for $(this).attr('other')?
[11:45:54] <BillCriswell> jbcfr1: Yes.
[11:45:59] <BillCriswell> .attr is sync.
[11:46:07] <jbcfr1> alright, thanks
[11:46:31] <Azrael_-> hi
[11:46:45] <aro> every mousemove
[11:48:41] <BillCriswell> aro: Looks like there's a start and stop event, you can start it in start and stop it in stop...
[11:51:39] * W0at is searching for arthurvr. You're here, Arthur?
[11:52:43] <arthurvr> Hi W0at. You need me?
[11:54:37] <W0at> Yes. Can I PM you? I have a question regarding h5bp v5, this was the only way I could reach out to you.
[11:55:20] <arthurvr> W0at: why not to move to #h5bp?
[11:57:17] <arthurvr> W0at: or was it jQuery related?
[12:06:01] <aro> BillCriswell: is there a way to 'double click' an item in a list and send it to a linked list?
[12:06:33] <BillCriswell> I never played with it so I don't know. Can't imagine it being impossible.
[12:09:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid double-clicking UX
[12:09:50] <robertmaxrees> but that's just me.
[12:25:06] <mirazi_heket> hello, is it possible to replace 1 with variable here? $("tr:nth-of-type(1)")
[12:25:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:25:27] <mirazi_heket> example please
[12:25:31] <robertmaxrees> $("tr:nth-of-type(" + someVariable + ")")
[12:25:37] <mirazi_heket> thanks a lot
[12:25:55] <kevireilly> well, need to mind escaping quotes ;)
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> i might look to avoid using :nth-of-type() if possible.
[12:29:53] <mirazi_heket> is this logical statement ok (comparing to c++) in for loop? "i <= variable"
[12:30:02] <mirazi_heket> i mean is there such thing in JS as <=
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> yes, but it's likely not what you want.
[12:30:40] <mirazi_heket> i want "when i is lesser or equal"
[12:30:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a forEach() if you can instead.
[12:30:52] <mirazi_heket> i cannot do so for my task
[12:31:11] <mirazi_heket> because loop generates html code
[12:31:13] <robertmaxrees> for (var i = 0; i < someLength; i ++)
[12:31:19] <robertmaxrees> is normally how you'd do this.
[12:31:25] <robertmaxrees> and forEach() can do that.
[12:33:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tyd63dhw/ one way.
[12:34:47] <mirazi_heket> im familiar with that, soon will paste working code what i am doing
[12:35:06] <robertmaxrees> <= can introduce an off-by-one error that you might not intend.
[12:35:34] <mirazi_heket> im listening
[12:36:04] <robertmaxrees> .length is calulated by getting the final index of the array and adding 1.
[12:36:18] <robertmaxrees> so given an array with 3 elements, you'll loop 4 times.
[12:36:38] <mirazi_heket> with <= yes
[12:36:43] <mirazi_heket> know that
[12:36:52] <mirazi_heket> loop starts from 0, my loop starts from 1
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:36:58] <mirazi_heket> thats intended aswell
[12:37:04] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:37:11] <mirazi_heket> soon, working on code
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> i would reverse that choice and go with 0 based indexes.
[12:37:56] <robertmaxrees> every single time i see somebody go against that, they end up regretting it.
[12:38:37] <marahin> Hey guys! I'm a JS/Jquery newbie. I have an issue, where I create a .dialog({title: event.title, width:350}); - the strange thing is, it doesn't have a cross ('X') in it's upper right's corner, in stead it's just an empty box: http://d.gimb.us/b/82e753b8e510a8666506d3d0c47300bd.png
[12:38:38] <mirazi_heket> imagine im agreeing with you, its special case
[12:38:41] <marahin> what am I doing wrong? :)
[12:39:09] <robertmaxrees> mirazi_heket doesn't change it ;)
[12:39:29] <robertmaxrees> marahin could you make a jsfiddle?
[12:39:48] <marahin> uh... give me a moment
[12:41:19] <marahin> huh! it works just fine @ jsfiddle
[12:41:20] <aro> i have an issue
[12:41:21] <marahin> dayum
[12:41:27] <aro> i am using .on('dblclick'
[12:41:36] <aro> and it moves an item from one sortable list to another
[12:41:42] <marahin> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/5htL89kj/
[12:41:45] <arthurvr> aro: jsfiddle maybe?
[12:41:50] <aro> however, the .on(dblclick does not register for the new item in the other list?
[12:42:00] <marahin> robertmaxrees: well, what possibly am I doing wrong then, any ideas?
[12:42:14] <mirazi_heket> http://jsfiddle.net/9yd6w16j/
[12:42:22] <mirazi_heket> fragment i finished
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> marahin http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5htL89kj/2/
[12:42:41] <robertmaxrees> make sure you have all your css loaded properly.
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> mirazi_heket that's still not a good idea.
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> what is szer?
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> and wys?
[12:44:27] <mirazi_heket> height and width
[12:44:34] <mirazi_heket> localized name of variables
[12:44:44] <mirazi_heket> you know columnds and rows in table
[12:44:44] <Baako> robertmaxrees: have you use phonegap before?
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> Baako nope.
[12:45:12] <robertmaxrees> mirazi_heket something about this seems really off to me, but okay.
[12:49:57] <mirazi_heket> doing crappy exercises for exam from site programming
[12:50:04] <mirazi_heket> teacher told what will be on exam
[12:50:28] <mirazi_heket> i know that pretty well and i can learn by myself, but thats quite silly, would prefer to do some php/sql
[12:56:14] <nutzz> Is there any way to select an element that just was added? I thought to generate an id dynamically, but isn't there any better option?
[12:57:08] <NoiseEee> how was it 'just added'?
[12:57:22] <bigelow> nutzz : How did you add it? usually jquery methods return self references.
[12:57:34] <nutzz> I use $(el).append()
[12:58:16] <nutzz> Oh, I didn't know about these references. Where can I read more about them?
[12:59:24] <bigelow> nutzz : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7475336/how-does-jquery-chaining-work
[13:00:23] <nutzz> thanks
[13:00:51] <NoiseEee> wait: you already have it. it's "el"
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:05:12] <nutzz> Let's say el is an container, maybe a div. I want to do something like this $(el).append("<div> foo </div>"). The question is how do I select the newly added div("<div> foo </div>")?
[13:05:26] <NoiseEee> you don't easily
[13:05:39] <nutzz> :D
[13:05:45] <NoiseEee> but if you did:  var newDiv = $('<div>').html('foo');
[13:05:56] <NoiseEee> you could el.append(newDiv) *and* have a reference to it in newDiv
[13:06:40] <nutzz> I just realised that I don't jquery :facepalm
[13:10:16] <bigelow> There's this plugin I wrote. Any feedback appreciated. https://github.com/anoopelias/mouseheld
[13:10:52] <d[^_^]b> i'm trying to use jqplot to graph and can't get my data to display: http://jsfiddle.net/DWFTb/442/
[13:13:10] <d[^_^]b> nvm, got it
[13:23:22] <Getty> i dont get it, now i got another stackoverflow thing and again nothing happens.....
[13:23:25] <aro> how can i search a bunch of list items for text with jquery?
[13:23:45] <Getty> but its always bad to test, as its so fast on the simulator ;) but still it should get called at least once....
[13:24:47] <Getty> ah ha! the xhr: function() is actually not executed at all.................
[13:27:01] <Getty> yeah... anyone an idea? why xhr: would not be called on $.ajax() ?
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> weee
[13:54:40] <Robdgreat> yo mofo weeeeeeeeee
[13:55:08] <robertmaxrees> unf
[14:05:25] <Getty> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i got it
[14:05:26] <Getty> damn
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:12:09] <Robdgreat> O.o
[14:21:28] <Getty> why the xhr function wasnt called
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:42] <robertmaxrees> what function?
[14:21:48] <Getty> i used some arraybuffer ajaxTransport fix and that one overrode the xhr: functionality
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:23:45] <Getty> [22:27:06] <Getty> yeah... anyone an idea? why xhr: would not be called on $.ajax() ?
[14:24:50] <Getty> and this is reasoning: https://github.com/LEDaquaristik/sunriser/blob/master/share/web/js/jquery-ajax-blob-arraybuffer.js
[14:24:55] <Getty> are you now following? ;)
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> no - what is "xhr: " supposed to be?
[14:29:30] <Getty> robertmaxrees: its a way to make your own XMLHTTPRequest object that is then used by $.ajax()
[14:29:40] <Getty> robertmaxrees: ah come on, dont tell me you didnt knew that
[14:29:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't understand the actual problem you were having.
[14:30:18] <Getty> in the base i wanted to add to the "progress" event of the XHR to make a progress bar
[14:31:47] <robertmaxrees> beforeSend - depending on upload or download, you attach an event listener to either XMLHttpRequest or XMLHttpRequest.upload
[14:32:16] <Getty> robertmaxrees: yeah "beforeSend" not "duringSend" ;)
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:32:41] <Getty> i need "duringSend" ;) as in "progress" event on XMLHttpRequest{.upload}
[14:32:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to attach a listener in the beforeSend callback.
[14:32:59] <robertmaxrees> http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[14:33:29] <Getty> AH ok thats an alternative way then, yeah, i just added "progress" option which adds to the XHR in the arraybuffer thing i use
[14:33:43] <robertmaxrees> what was the solution you wound up with?
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> can you share it?
[14:34:00] <Getty> if you gimme a sec then i commit it
[14:35:13] <Getty> https://github.com/LEDaquaristik/sunriser/blob/master/share/web/js/jquery-ajax-blob-arraybuffer.js#L52-L60
[14:35:18] <Jattenalle> hey jquery folks, why, when i have: $('button') does it not only give me all <button></button>'s, but also <select></select>'s?
[14:35:30] <robertmaxrees> only buttons.
[14:36:05] <Getty> Jattenalle: there is no blackmagic $('xxx') seeks <xxx>
[14:36:13] <Jattenalle> that's what i assumed
[14:36:24] <Jattenalle> but this is the behaviour i'm observing.. will fiddle with it more
[14:36:30] <Getty> browser? weather? other code? ;)
[14:36:41] <Getty> yeah make a fiddle, i found my problem when i put it minimal in fiddle ;)
[14:36:41] <robertmaxrees> try fiddling it :)
[14:39:03] <Jattenalle> i can do one better, i can show you live at http://www.hitbox.tv/apistudios
[14:39:07] <Jattenalle> it's really odd though
[14:39:10] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:39:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not necessarily "better"
[14:39:21] <Jattenalle> literally this line: var btns = $(element).find('.menu button'); is causing all kinds of weird behaviour
[14:39:36] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, well, it's "better" since my code wont run in a browser, it's a game UI
[14:39:48] <Jattenalle> hence why i didnt really push the question :)
[14:39:59] <Jattenalle> i know it's a bit pointless, you already answered that what i'm seeing with button is wrong
[14:40:31] <Getty> Jattenalle: the point is that your stuff might be a problem of the surrounding elements which YOU know better, so if you try making a minimal case in fiddle, you will find the problem yourself OR see that there is no problem WITHOUT the stuff around
[14:40:54] <Getty> and its always unfair to let the people seek in "all the stuff" ;)
[14:41:00] <Jattenalle> Getty, yeah, i'm aware
[14:41:05] <Jattenalle> i didnt ask anyone to seek ;)
[14:41:28] <Getty> you tease us! ;)
[14:42:25] <Jattenalle> haha, well check the stream, it's a really odd bug... basically, i have a select.. it works fine, until i allow the above $(... button) thing to execute, then it breaks..
[14:42:31] <Jattenalle> time to watch all the breakpoints
[14:42:37] <Jattenalle> and cry when it's something obvious :)
[14:51:57] <Jattenalle> wtf, so instead of: var btns = $(element).find('.menu button');
[14:52:03] <Jattenalle> which broke my select
[14:52:24] <Jattenalle> changing it to: var btns = $(element).find('.menu'); btns = btns.find('button');
[14:52:26] <Jattenalle> makes it work
[14:52:35] * Jattenalle all the wtf's
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:52:48] <robertmaxrees> what's the host environment here?
[14:52:55] <robertmaxrees> you said it's not a browser, right?
[14:53:06] <Jattenalle> var btns = $(element).find('.menu').find('button');
[14:53:09] <Jattenalle> also works
[14:53:24] <Jattenalle> but having '.menu button' makes the select "behave" as a button
[14:53:26] <Jattenalle> that is so odd
[14:53:32] <robertmaxrees> which makes sense - that's basically the same as the other one you posted.
[14:53:33] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, webkit
[14:53:36] <Jattenalle> yeah
[14:54:06] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to fiddle that, then.  sounds like a bad document.
[14:54:37] <Jattenalle> i should, but problem solved :)
[14:54:44] <Jattenalle> it's now a feature!
[14:54:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix the underlying problem.
[14:55:27] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, the document is sane, no conflicts, but i suspect it's just an issue with my version of webkit
[14:55:39] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be, but ok.
[15:31:59] <Sal> hi, does anyone know why this: $('html').addClass('myclass')   doesn't work on android chrome?
[15:32:06] <Sal> its working on chrome desktop
[15:33:21] <robertmaxrees> you sure it's not adding and you're not seeing anothe rbug?
[15:34:01] <Sal> i saw the source  and its not adind it
[15:34:07] <robertmaxrees> interesting.,
[15:34:16] <Sal> also because, i have a div showing when class is added
[15:34:27] <Sal> this div is display on desktop, but not on mobile
[15:34:39] <robertmaxrees> iirc some mobile browsers don't repaint the way they should, thgat's why i asked.
[15:35:38] <Sal> could it be because i remove and add on the same code line?
[15:35:57] <Sal> i mean: $('html').removeClass('oldclass').addClass('myclass');
[15:36:11] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[15:36:47] <Sal> damn
[15:37:13] <Sal> i wanted to use it to assign classes depending if the device was touchable or for mouse
[15:37:32] <Sal> think i have to find another solution
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're meeting your criteria?
[15:38:11] <Sal> its and if..else..
[15:38:23] <Sal> on desktop one condition works
[15:38:28] <Sal> so the other should too
[15:38:36] <Sal> same code, just difefrent classes
[15:38:37] <robertmaxrees> do a console log or an alert or something to make sure.
[15:38:49] <Sal> yes, i'll do an alert
[15:39:57] <Richie> Can someone help me with making a calculator that has multiple results?

[15:40:35] <Sal> oh damn f_cking mvc structure!!! i think i forgot to upload a directory
[15:40:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:41:17] <Richie> I'm confused..
[15:41:18] <Sal> yep, it was that
[15:41:23] <Sal> sorry
[15:41:30] <Sal> its working now
[15:41:30] <robertmaxrees> Richie if you have a question, just ask it.
[15:41:40] <robertmaxrees> Sal sometimes we need to ask the obvious questions :)
[15:42:11] <Richie> <script type="text/javascript">
[15:42:11] <Richie> jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[15:42:11] <Richie>  jQuery('#rev-result').hide();
[15:42:11] <Richie>  jQuery('#rev-calculate').click(function() {
[15:42:11] <Richie>   var ppos = jQuery('#rev-ppos').val();
[15:42:12] <Richie>   var medicare = jQuery('#rev-medicare').val();
[15:42:12] <Richie>   jQuery('#rev-result').html("\<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"\>Daily Billing Total $" + (ppos * 40 + medicare * 28) + " \</p\>");
[15:42:12] <Sal> now i can have different styling depending on device input instead of screen size
[15:42:13] <Richie>   jQuery('#rev-result').slideDown(450);
[15:42:13] <Richie>  });
[15:42:14] <Richie> });

[15:42:23] <Richie> Oops.
[15:42:45] <robertmaxrees> Sal btw IE11 reports that it's got touch enabled, so be careful ;)

[15:45:02] <Richie> Okay, thank you, it is http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=kbaptM2zGV
[15:45:18] <Sal> robertmaxrees, ok, thanks,. i'll test it
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> Richie wrong idea - let me fix this for you.
[15:45:52] <Richie> I need to add more results as well and okay, thank you
[15:46:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fqva0Lmm/
[15:46:44] <robertmaxrees> see the "frameworks & extensions" dropdown on the upper left?
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> that's how you add jquery.
[15:47:20] <Richie> okay
[15:47:38] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue you're facing now?
[15:48:57] <Richie> so it _____ * 40 + ______ = result and works, but now i need to make that result and minus 19 and have that number show up on a new line as well
[15:49:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.  where are you getting stuck?
[15:49:18] <Richie> oops ______ * 40 + ______ * 28 = result
[15:49:57] <Richie> I can't seem to figure out how to make the result it's own variable, I'm not exactly sure how to get that output and input it into a another formula
[15:50:15] <robertmaxrees> yoiu
[15:50:23] <Richie> result - 19 * (another field) is what I need
[15:50:28] <robertmaxrees> woops - you're already declaring other variables.
[15:50:32] <robertmaxrees> so follow that pattern :)
[15:50:37] <Richie> hmm
[15:51:55] <robertmaxrees> try it :)
[15:55:08] <robertmaxrees> Richie also - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fqva0Lmm/1/
[15:55:25] <robertmaxrees> if you mix " and ', you don't need to escape your markup at all.
[15:55:31] <robertmaxrees> well, for the most part.
[15:55:58] <Richie> okay
[15:56:07] <robertmaxrees> still stuck on the variable bit?
[15:56:59] <Richie> I'm trying that
[15:57:12] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fqva0Lmm/3/
[15:57:38] <Richie> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[16:27:18] <jukeking> Not sure that's working Robert: http://jsbin.com/xipufecidu/2/edit :(
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> not how you do that.
[16:32:07] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you need a single "root" node.
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> second off, you'd just do strong = $(foo).find('strong'); - like this.
[16:32:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/kezehilohi/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:33:24] <jukeking> oh
[16:42:09] <Richie> thank you so much robertmaxrees, really helped me out a bunch :)
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> fsho :)
[16:48:59] <aro> how do i rebind a listener after replacing a nodes contents with .html()
[16:49:37] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[16:49:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for some more ifno.
[16:51:09] <aro> ive tried using .on
[16:51:11] <aro> but it doesnt work
[16:51:17] <robertmaxrees> basically, $(parent).on('click', 'child', function() {});
[16:51:19] <robertmaxrees> like that.
[16:51:30] <aro> ok
[16:51:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of $('theelement').on('click', function() {});
[16:52:20] <aro> got it
[16:52:38] <robertmaxrees> your parent has to exist at the time of binding and can't be removed.
[16:52:43] <aro> so question, if i use .off() on that, wont it unbind everything?
[16:53:01] <robertmaxrees> yep, which is why you should avoid unbinding handlers :)
[16:53:11] <aro> hm ok
[16:53:21] <aro> is there a way to remove a particular binding?
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> avoid unbinding the handler in the first part.
[16:54:09] <robertmaxrees> you can namespace them instead, but i'd check inside the handler if you should run the code.
[16:54:13] <aro> why? i have to replace the elements
[16:54:21] <aro> how do i check in the handler?
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> why are you unbinding?
[16:54:32] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be really helpful here.
[16:54:49] <aro> let me see if i can put on together
[16:54:54] <aro> this app has been a monster to create
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> just trying to understand why you're unbinding at all.
[16:55:19] <aro> typically when i did the kinds of bindings you suggested, i would do $(document.body).on('click', 'element', function(e) { });
[16:55:30] <aro> because i run the rebinding as a function
[16:55:39] <aro> i dont want to have 100 duplicate bindings on an element
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> right, yeah, so instead you use a single delegated listener.
[16:55:52] <robertmaxrees> no need to then remove them.
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> just add the listener once.
[16:56:03] <aro> ok
[16:56:07] <aro> you are right
[16:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you should tell my wife that ;)
[16:56:25] <aro> hehe
[16:58:00] <aro> now i get this: TypeError: this.placeholder[0].parentNode is null
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> check this.placeholder[0]
[18:54:15] <jukeking> http://jsbin.com/haxepeyafa/3/edit?html,js,console,output any  idea why the transitionend callback isn't firing?
[18:58:12] <limbera> hi
[18:58:18] <limbera> i'm struggling to access a variable outside of a .get callback
[18:58:31] <limbera> http://dpaste.com/2HKP533
[18:58:52] <limbera> in this example: http://dpaste.com/13P65N0
[18:58:58] <limbera> line 5 returns undefined
[19:00:40] <numproc> limbera: you have to use custom events
[19:01:13] <limbera> i see
[19:03:44] <limbera> numproc: do you mean line .done .fail .always
[19:05:14] <numproc> limbera: http://jsbin.com/fajanozasi/1/edit
[19:08:14] <limbera> still doesn't seem to work
[19:08:17] <limbera> i must be doing something else wrong
[19:08:40] <limbera> http://dpaste.com/3CGF42S
[19:08:44] <limbera> line 7 prints the correct results
[19:08:48] <limbera> line 14 prints undefined
[19:12:48] <numproc> limbera: i tould you the only way to get result ouside of $.get is by triggered it, thats correct on line 7 u get result because of custom events, you can get result outside of $.get without custom events because $.get is asynchronous requests and the data is trigered before the request has finished
[19:14:21] <numproc> try this : http://jsbin.com/fajanozasi/2/edit
[19:15:40] <limbera> oh ok i think i get it
[19:15:47] <limbera> i'll just put a function in the callback
[19:15:51] <limbera> that does what i need it to do
[19:16:05] <numproc> yes that will work

[20:45:27] <Uhkis> Vipul_: have you tried event.stopPropagation();
[20:46:38] <Vipul_> No, do I have to use it on popover close event ?

[21:06:17] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm creating an alert system in which a message in a span slides out from behind a div and then fades; is there a to get that span back to its original position once the sequence is over, sort of like a reset?
[21:14:49] <Vipul_> @neanderslob, try animate function and hide that span on its complete event.
[21:15:42] <neanderslob> Vipul_: thanks for the reply; that's actually what I've been doing; I was just wondering if there was a convenient "back to the original state" function that I didn't know about
[21:18:17] <Vipul_> ok, how about using slideToggle() for that span ??
[21:18:45] <Vipul_> ping neanderslob ok, how about using slideToggle() for that span ??
[21:19:25] <neanderslob> Vipul_: that could work too, thanks

[23:09:07] <kostodo> How do I set an input field to only accept Latin characters? i.e. exclude cyrillic, chinese, arabic, etc.
[23:21:17] <Cork> kostodo: check input patttern
[23:21:20] <Cork> ?mdn input
[23:21:21] <b-ot> Cork: <input> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[23:21:36] <kostodo> Pattern is not compatible with IE9
[23:21:55] <Cork> it is
[23:22:04] <Cork> you just fall back to not limiting it in ie9
[23:22:15] <Cork> you should have a server side validation for this anyway
[23:22:36] <kostodo> So the best way to do it is with regex?
[23:22:42] <Cork> its the only way
[23:22:50] <kostodo> Hmm
[23:22:57] <kostodo> ok
[23:23:14] <Cork> either you do it with regex in the pattern field
[23:23:27] <Cork> or you do it with regex in an change/input event handler
[23:23:42] <Cork> either way you have to use regex
[23:23:58] <kostodo> understood
[23:25:45] <kostodo> Cork: would you know what regex most effectively achieves what I want?
[23:26:36] <Cork> depending if you want include or exclude
[23:26:42] <Cork> opps
[23:26:46] <Cork> /^[^a-z0-9]+$/ or /^[a-z0-9]+$/
[23:27:09] <Cork> ^ exclude     ^ include
[23:33:35] <gtristan> Is there something like $(element).find('selector') which includes matches from 'element' instead of only descendants ?
[23:34:10] <Cork> gtristan: $(element).find('selector').addBack().filter('selector')
[23:34:14] <kostodo> Cork: does that include exlaimation marks, etc? !@#$%^&*()_-+=<> and so on
[23:34:20] <Cork> no
[23:34:33] <Cork> it allows a-z
[23:34:36] <Cork> not even A-Z
[23:34:39] <gtristan> hmmm, addBack... ok that could do it :)
[23:35:22] <kostodo> I’m really only looking to exclude chinese, arabic, cyrillic, and weird accents :)
[23:35:31] <Cork> kostodo: basically every character you want to allow is listed in the []
[23:36:08] <PlNG> in QUnit is there a way to check only the properties of an object and not the position of the values?
[23:37:07] <gtristan> Cork, that can be simplified to $(element).find ('selector').addBack ('selector') no ?
[23:37:19] <kostodo> so like /^[a-z0-9`~!@#$%^&*()_+-={}|[]\:”;’<>?,./]+$/
[23:37:35] <Cork> kostodo: you prob want a-zA-Z
[23:37:39] <Cork> but ya
[23:37:56] <kostodo> yeah
[23:38:12] <Cork> gtristan: yes, wasn't sure if addBack took a selector
[23:38:30] <gtristan> k, just checking if there was a reason for the extra filter :)
[23:38:49] <PlNG> ehh disregard that, I thought properties were being sorted, but they're actually being injected from elsewhere.
[23:38:55] <Cork> gtristan: no having it in addBack is MUCH better
[23:39:10] <Cork> filter would double loop the matched elements
[23:39:12] <Cork> so ya...
[23:39:16] <gtristan> yeah I would guess so... it's not a query I will run often but indeed :)
