[02:03:42] <Cork> docmur: firefox only provides geolocation if the device have a gps
[03:59:09] <latemus> the function starting on line 52 doesnt work for delete and update, i think because they are loading async from .getJSON every second, see line 8. so the problem is that they click handler cant access the list items, because they are not in the dom yet, right?
[03:59:13] <latemus> https://pastebin.com/hPAqEHUu
[04:00:48] <Cork> latemus: delegate the event handler to a static parent => $('static parent').on('click', '.activate_modal', func)
[04:06:55] <rical> I'm flashing a in a specific sequence light using $("#light").delay(on).fadeOut(fade); ...fadeIn() and so on. As it's asynchronous I don't know how to check if the seqeuence is complete to restart it again? I don't want to busy-wait
[04:07:17] <rical> I'm flashing alight in a specific sequence ^
[04:07:55] <Cork> rical: do you have to have support for old ie browsers?
[04:08:14] <Cork> else i would recommend using css animate instead
[04:08:14] <rical> not necessary
[04:08:32] <Cork> then you could just add a class listen for the animationend event and remove it
[04:09:04] <Cork> anyway alternatively you can add a callback to the last fadeIn/Out method and remove it there
[04:09:45] <Cork> but the reason i suggested animate is cause js is much more costly to use for animation
[04:09:51] <Cork> so it tests to be jerkier
[04:11:27] <Cork> uh... tests == tends...
[04:11:39] <Cork> (kinda shows what i'm working on right now does it >_<')
[04:12:40] <rical> another idea, at the end of my flash function I can re-register it with setTimeout(); as I can calculate how long it will run for
[04:12:43] <rical> seems to work
[04:13:05] <Cork> no you can't
[04:13:14] <Cork> cause jquery uses animation frames
[04:13:18] <Cork> so it isn't a set time
[04:13:32] <rical> ah, you mean it might drift?
[04:13:34] <Cork> ex. if you switch tab the animation stops until focus comes back
[04:13:38] <Cork> it will
[04:13:54] <Cork> but like i said you can use the callback from the last fade* function
[04:14:02] <Cork> if you absolutely want to have it as js animation
[04:15:05] <rical> if I do it with css, can I still "sleep"?
[04:15:16] <Cork> you don't need to
[04:15:30] <Cork> you can create a @key-frame loop
[04:15:58] <Cork> so you add the class and the fade will keep going
[04:16:52] <rical> reading up in keyframes
[04:17:07] <Cork> ex. @key-frame { 0% { opacity: 0 } 33% { opacity: 1 } 66% { opacity: 1 } }
[04:17:32] <latemus> Cork: thanks
[04:17:35] <Cork> you adjust the percent to set how much of the time you want on each step
[04:17:53] <Cork> in that example between 33% and 66% it stays at opacity: 1
[04:18:10] <Cork> (and then it animates back to opacity: 1 for 0%)
[04:18:42] <Cork> latemus: this might be helpful https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations
[04:18:57] <rical> cool stuff
[04:19:46] <rical> Cork: how would I make the light stay on for X ms?
[04:20:30] <rical> found animation-delay
[04:20:31] <Cork> rical: animate: 10s, then you set how many percent of that you want in the @keyframe
[04:20:53] <Cork> don't tnink you can use animation-delay in keyframe, but i might be wrong
[04:20:59] <rical> seems to work
[04:21:03] <rical> (TM)
[04:21:07] <Cork> cool
[04:21:10] <Cork> didn't know that
[04:21:16] <Cork> (never needed it)
[04:21:29] <rical> ah, it only delays the first iteration
[04:21:32] <rical> oviously
[04:21:37] <Cork> ya
[04:21:52] <Cork> if you find another solution then the percent solution, please share
[04:21:57] <Cork> :D
[04:22:09] <Cork> but it should be fairly simple to get that working
[05:05:03] <rical> Cork: when you said "but like i said you can use the callback from the last fade* function" how did you mean?
[05:05:30] <Cork> fadeOut(200, function(){ /* done */ })
[05:05:38] <rical> ah, okey, thanks
[05:10:43] <rical> Cork: can I call myself with arguments somehow? fadeOut(200, foobar(1,2)); ?
[05:10:59] <Cork> call your self?
[05:11:10] <rical> well, a function
[05:11:17] <Cork> just put it in the anonymous function
[05:11:25] <Cork> function() { foobar(1,2) }
[05:11:40] <Cork> you could call it directly if it didn't take arguments
[05:27:56] <reizuki> I'm trying to create a dynamically created list with sublists from JSON and hide the sublists until the elements in the main list are clicked.
[05:28:15] <reizuki> It doesn't work, though: https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/
[05:28:48] <frogboy> https://jsfiddle.net/g03z010f/1/
[05:28:51] <reizuki>  if there are any other non-obvious errors in my approach, pointing them out would be also welcome
[05:28:53] <frogboy> Why isn't the second trigger working?
[05:33:04] <frogboy> Oh, it fires twice because they're nested.
[05:33:44] <Cork> reizuki: i would add a default value of display: none and add a class for exapanded
[05:36:22] <reizuki> Cork: as you can see in the jsfiddle, I have a display:none commented out for testing purposes
[05:36:39] <Cork> reizuki: https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/2/
[05:36:47] <reizuki> it should toggle properly just as this statically defined one here: https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/1/
[05:37:32] <Cork> the way you use delegate is really silly, as it adds one event handler for each entry for no reason
[05:37:53] <Cork> just use relative dom reference and you can use one
[05:38:34] <Cork> reizuki: also you want to cache externalJson.length and externalJson[i].content.length
[05:38:38] <reizuki> I knew that adding unique IDs to every element can be solved in an easier way :)
[05:38:48] <Cork> currently you messure the size of the array on each itteration and that is unneeded
[05:39:18] <reizuki> thank you
[05:42:31] <reizuki> Cork: btw I noticed you changed id= to data-id=. I'm quite new to JS/HTML, why did you do that?
[05:42:49] <Cork> reizuki: cause the code doesn't depend on the id
[05:42:59] <Cork> i just saved the json id if you needed it somewhere
[05:47:53] <FrenchUser> Hi everyone. I'm here to see if someone noticed the change of display of the menu plugin with the latest Chrome version (59).
[05:48:18] <FrenchUser> (jQuery UI : https://jqueryui.com/menu/)
[05:50:29] <Cork> reizuki: an alternative structure if you're interested https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/4/
[05:50:59] <Cork> that one is immune to xss something your code might be depending on if the source is sanitized
[05:53:43] <FrenchUser> Here's the bug (space between items) : https://pasteboard.co/2y7dXYvyV.png
[05:54:09] <FrenchUser> Sorry : https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/2y7dXYvyV.png
[05:54:57] <Cork> hmm it 's the list-style-image
[05:55:52] <Cork> ah /* support: IE10, see #8844 */
[05:56:05] <Cork> that one is tripping up chrome
[05:57:21] <FrenchUser> Yeah, happened this morning with the 59 update
[05:59:01] <FrenchUser> Cork Sorry i did a bad manipulation
[05:59:12] <Cork> i would suggest filing a bug against jquery-ui
[05:59:34] <Cork> and then they can report it to google if it really is a bug in the browser
[05:59:37] <FrenchUser> I didn't really know if it was still a living bug tracker
[06:00:04] <FrenchUser> Ok thanks, apparently i'm the first one to notice it
[06:00:40] <Cork> i don't use the ui menu plugin so hard to notice it ^^
[06:01:54] <FrenchUser> You couldn't miss it ! its like all the former height of the item that is added in top of it
[06:04:34] <Cork> yes you can, if you don't use it :)
[06:13:16] <reizuki> Cork: regarding caching of length
[06:13:22] <reizuki> I think it doesn't matter in modern browsers
[06:13:24] <reizuki> https://jsperf.com/array-length-in-loop
[06:13:30] <reizuki> so you can just write readable code :)
[06:14:01] <shayla> Hi guys, i've got a object type File, and i want to send it through a POST request
[06:14:03] <reizuki> and thanks for the alternative version, i'll take a look
[06:14:22] <Cork> reizuki: caching is just for(var i = 0, length = arr.length; i < length; i++) {}
[06:14:22] <shayla> I try simply using data: {image: image}, processData: false
[06:14:29] <shayla> But it doesn't seems to work
[06:14:48] <Cork> reizuki: so it isn't harder to read, and some browsers do the caching in jit cause so many web developers miss toing this
[06:14:53] <Cork> * doing this
[06:15:18] <Cork> but it is still a good idea to do anyway
[06:15:33] <reizuki> Cork: for me the jsperf results seem to perform faster with the jit caching version though...
[06:15:41] <reizuki> latest firefox
[06:15:50] <Cork> i don't see how
[06:16:18] <Cork> anyway afk
[08:13:19] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, can anyone help me with this? I'm trying to make a right to left slideshow with 3 images. Only 1 image should appear, in the center... and every second, the images slides to the left and the next images slides in... it has to go keep going like that. This is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/3youo6gk/1/
[08:14:04] <KnightsOfNi> I'm guessing putting 3 images in the div and hiding 2 of them with overflow:hidden is the best way to go about it?
[08:18:51] <MikeD_> how do you animate "sliding" from the 3rd image back to the first?
[08:19:53] <MikeD_> have you used existing slider plugins or are you rolling your own from scratch with no prior experience?
[08:21:31] <KnightsOfNi> MikeD_: I don't want to use a plugin for this
[08:21:48] <KnightsOfNi> seems very basic, but indeed, I don't know how to slide from the third back to the first
[08:24:23] <MikeD_> understood.  "seems basic" is how you find yourself falling down a rabbit hole ... that's good experience, certainly - but if you have a tight deadline, many would rather someone else's tested/proven code over working through the edge cases.
[08:25:05] <MikeD_> mostly i was asking about your experience with other slider/carousel/etc for the sake of how annoying they are and if you're going to build a better mousetrap, what your design goals are for that ugly bit of sliding back to the first image from the last :)
[08:27:28] <KnightsOfNi> I've used slider plugins before, for hero sections on blogs
[08:28:01] <MikeD_> i've never tried to implement one, but i've seen enough to know that mostly i hate them.
[08:29:00] <MikeD_> now i see a lot of autoplay video instead of sliders... because people use the web to watch commercials, obviously.
[08:29:09] <KnightsOfNi> lol
[08:29:56] <MikeD_> admittedly, i've left your intended use for building one and i'm just on a rant now
[08:30:44] <KnightsOfNi> I said it's basic, because I already did just this with fade effect
[08:31:02] <KnightsOfNi> so it can't be so hard to do it with slide effect I'd imagine?
[08:31:35] <MikeD_> not so hard
[10:00:49] <latemus> im sending form data to my php api, via .post. i have set type to "json", and when i dont use .serialize() on the form, it just sends 'httpFormObj=' or something like that
[10:01:23] <latemus> how do i get .post to send a json object containing the form values as pairs ?
[10:10:02] <latemus> or is it more in
[10:10:39] <latemus> line with RESTful design to have the api ACCEPT normal serialized query strings, and only RESPOND with json?
[10:14:54] <reizuki> holy crap this $ thing makes jquery documentation hard to read sometimes
[10:15:29] <reizuki> Cork gave me a code example where he creates objects like this $('<li>', { class: "main", data: { id: type.id }, text: type.text })
[10:15:53] <reizuki> I've tried to find documentation on that on Jquery, currently browsing Selectors category
[10:16:04] <Cork> reizuki: ya, the jquery function is heavily overloaded
[10:16:31] <Cork> reizuki: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[10:17:06] <Cork> reizuki: $('<li>') is a shorthand for $(document.createElement('li')
[10:17:10] <Cork> *)
[10:18:05] <reizuki> that much I figured, but when I tried to play around with it in console like $("#container").html($('div').html('foo'));
[10:18:17] <reizuki> it replaced the contents with emptiness, no "foo" div
[10:18:32] <reizuki> so i figured the second argument {} is necessary and started digging through docs
[10:18:34] <Cork> $('div') != $('<div>')
[10:18:44] <reizuki> oh.
[10:18:47] <reizuki> OHHHHHHHH
[10:19:07] <reizuki> how could I have missed that.
[10:19:10] <Cork> :)
[10:19:14] <Cork> $('div') finds the div elements in the page and modifies them
[10:19:24] <Cork> $('<div>') creates a new one
[10:20:04] <Cork> reizuki: ya $() is a bit weird it has a ton of functionality depending on the content you give it
[10:20:10] <reizuki> alright, thanks again :)
[10:20:14] <Cork> np
[10:20:33] <reizuki> since you're here, any reason for using $.map() instead of JS builtin .map()?
[10:20:40] <Cork> yes
[10:20:56] <MikeD_> please explain
[10:20:57] <Cork> $.map() gives you an array $().map() gives you a jquery object
[10:21:22] <Cork> so you are only meant to use $().map() when you want to work with dom elements
[10:21:37] <Cork> you can do wasteful things like $().map().get()
[10:21:37] <reizuki> well, but you used $.map() on an anrray of json objects in my example
[10:21:46] <reizuki> so it was [].map(), not $().map()
[10:21:50] <Cork> but that constructs the jquery object to later just throw it away
[10:22:06] <Cork> reizuki: ya, and that is why you should use $.map()
[10:22:13] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/ND30LoE.png - How to do horizontal mirror flip of everything on <body></body> ?
[10:22:15] <Cork> cause $() is again meant to be used for elements
[10:22:27] <reizuki> so my question is why $.map([],func) instead of [].map(func)
[10:22:29] <Cork> reizuki: .map is a jquery method it doesn't exist on array
[10:22:46] <MikeD_> it does now though
[10:23:02] <reizuki> it sure does
[10:23:04] <Cork> IamTrying: check css transform
[10:23:12] <reizuki> i used it in my JS tutorial on freecodecamp
[10:23:14] <reizuki> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[10:23:18] <reizuki> Array.prototype.map()
[10:23:20] <IamTrying> Great Guru Cork, thanks
[10:23:39] <MikeD_> i made the point in our dev team that if we have $.map() already in our code, for consistency's sake stick with it to prevent confusion
[10:23:58] <Cork> ah i guess it has been around long enough to use now
[10:24:11] <reizuki> I guess I have my answer now :)
[10:24:15] <Cork> kinda ingrained in my fiber to use $.map() cause of old browsers :)
[10:24:29] <MikeD_> that $.map() and $.each() have reversed parameter signatures is still something i trip over
[10:24:39] <Cork> and ya, who cares about ie8 now days >_>
[10:24:57] <Cork> MikeD_: ya, me too
[10:25:03] <Cork> i have to check it every other usage
[10:25:24] <reizuki> uh, I learned javascript last week
[10:25:42] <reizuki> should I learn what $.each() does? or is it enough to use JS prototypes now?
[10:25:46] <Cork> reizuki: one point though  $.map() can handle objects too
[10:25:48] <reizuki> sounds like some scary legacies
[10:25:55] <Cork> so it still has its usage :)
[10:26:15] <reizuki> Cork: yeah I found that out when I read $.map() documentation to try and find out why you did that
[10:27:06] <Cork> and Object.keys(obj).map(function(key) { return obj[key] }) isn't quite as snazy :)
[10:27:27] <Cork> there is Object.values(obj) though for that simple case
[10:27:48] <Cork> but they are way WAY to young to use yet though
[10:27:59] <Cork> (no ie support or safari)
[10:28:19] <reizuki> I guess I will start caring about compatibility with old browsers later
[10:28:36] <reizuki> I heard there's something like babel as a crutch for this anyway
[10:28:41] <Cork> reizuki: if you check mdn just look at the browser compatibility list at the bottom
[10:28:58] <Cork> it is actually quite good to take that as a habit
[10:29:04] <Cork> cause that changes over time
[10:29:09] <Cork> (obviously)
[10:29:42] <Cork> and for css caniuse.com is superb
[10:32:29] <galgamach> Hi all. I'm having a "select" in my code and I want to change it to "selected" if it has two options inside it. So I'm using the following code but I don't get it to work.  https://pastebin.com/fgJVj4fd
[10:32:38] <galgamach> Is my error inside the jQuery ?
[10:32:39] <reizuki> seems like the only old browser with above 1% marketshare is IE8 with 1.5%
[10:33:13] <jluc> Hello
[10:33:19] <jluc> Just to know before packaging a new version of our app,
[10:33:21] <Cork> galgamach: don't use attr, use prop
[10:33:22] <jluc> is a new jquery or jqueryUI version released in the coming days ?
[10:33:28] <Cork> galgamach: basically only use attr if prop doesn't work
[10:33:41] <jluc> will a new jquery or jqueryUI version be released in the coming days ?
[10:34:39] <galgamach> Cork, thanks..!! No effect either  :-(
[10:35:47] <Cork> galgamach: could you update this one with the relevant html? https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/1/
[10:36:16] <galgamach> Cork, OK ..w8
[10:36:38] <Cork> cause i'm quite sure this code can be simplified A LOT
[10:36:57] <Cork> but i need to see the "color-chooser-select" element
[10:37:19] <reizuki> This guy simplifies.
[10:37:30] <galgamach> Cork, I think I've updated it... check again
[10:37:41] <Cork> click update and send the new link
[10:37:57] <galgamach> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/4/
[10:38:15] <Cork> hmm, could you replace the php?
[10:38:25] <Cork> doesn't have to be real data, just representative of the type
[10:38:42] <galgamach> replace it with what ?
[10:38:58] <reizuki> with example values
[10:39:01] <Cork> <option></option><option></option> with representative content
[10:39:02] <Cork> yes
[10:39:16] <Cork> basically make it static so i can see what js has to work with
[10:41:13] <Cork> cause i suspect you can replace that with $('.color-chooser-select option:not([value]) + option:last-child').prop('selected', true);
[10:41:50] <galgamach> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/5/
[10:42:04] <Cork> perfect
[10:42:49] <Cork> ah, ya of course you have value="" on the instructon entry, i should have known that >_<
[10:43:05] <Cork> galgamach: https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/6/
[10:43:28] <Cork> slightly reduced amount of code :D
[10:43:56] <Cork> and to prove it works https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/7/
[10:44:36] <Cork> galgamach: what it does is select the .color-chooser-select element looks for the element with value=""
[10:44:52] <Cork> selectes the next option element as long as it is the last child in the list and sets selected to it
[10:45:08] <Cork> (css ftw!)
[10:45:40] <galgamach> Cork, huh.!! Got it.!!  Looks soooo valid but still not working ... hmmm
[10:45:52] <Cork> uh, works fine here
[10:46:01] <Cork> notice /7/ is MEANT not to work
[10:46:08] <Cork> /6/ does though
[10:46:35] <Cork> it is to prove the if(count == 2) case
[10:47:39] <galgamach> yeah that was the point...  I='m copying pasting the /6/ but still ..
[10:48:01] <Cork> hmm if you open your page in the browser and inspecting the select element
[10:48:13] <Cork> does it look the same as the jsfiddle example?
[10:48:24] <Cork> btw where are you running the code?
[10:48:29] <Cork> in a script tag in head?
[10:49:00] <Cork> cause if you are you need to wrap it in $(function() {});
[10:49:23] <Cork> galgamach: try https://jsfiddle.net/fr8pv69p/9/ in the page
[10:50:36] <galgamach> Cork, this small jQuery script is inside a   $( document ).ready(function()
[10:50:48] <Cork> hmm
[10:50:51] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[10:51:14] <Cork> (if it is < 1.5 .prop doesn't exist)
[10:53:06] <galgamach> Cork, it's 1.11.2
[10:53:07] <galgamach> hmmm
[10:53:28] <Cork> is the html loaded through ajax?
[10:53:37] <Cork> or directly in the html on page load?
[10:53:41] <galgamach> well it's a phtml
[10:53:57] <Cork> ok, the html in the jsfiddle doesn't match what you have then
[10:54:26] <galgamach> so I should replace prop with attr ?
[10:54:34] <Cork> no
[10:54:43] <Cork> the html, not the js
[10:55:12] <Cork> you could try running the $() in the browser console and remove each section and see where it starts to give no result
[10:55:20] <reizuki> going back to my example https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/2/ (linking the non $.map() generated version as it's still easier to read for me). What if I wanted only clicking on "Animals" to de-expand the sublist, not e.g. "Tiger"? Should I put the "Animals" inside <span> and change selector to .siblings('ul')?
[10:55:20] <Cork> (simplest is to run $('').length)
[10:56:03] <reizuki> or maybe try to assign an empty function to the click handler on the <ul> inside <li class="main">?
[10:56:21] <Cork> reizuki: you mean you want to clicking the ul to have no effect?
[10:56:25] <reizuki> yes
[10:56:44] <Cork> reizuki: https://jsfiddle.net/urr7ztup/5/
[10:57:06] <Cork> or add a span around the text and bind the click handler on that instead of the li
[10:57:14] <galgamach> Cork, when you say $('').lenght
[10:57:14] <galgamach> ?
[10:57:30] <reizuki> yeah, I thought of the span approach, but your way looks cleaner :)
[10:57:39] <Cork> galgamach: i mean like $('.color-chooser-select').length
[10:57:54] <Cork> and then add each selector section until you get 0 as the result
[10:58:02] <Cork> then you find why
[10:58:11] <galgamach> this gives Cannot read property 'length' of null
[10:58:19] <Cork> uh
[10:58:30] <Cork> oook try jQuery('.color-chooser-select')
[10:58:53] <Cork> either your browser is replacing $ with an internal debugger command
[10:59:01] <Cork> or your page doesn't have $ as jQuery
[10:59:17] <Cork> (that might actually be the cause of the problem)
[10:59:19] <galgamach> yeah it gives something back   https://pastebin.com/4dhyBJjb
[10:59:54] <Cork> galgamach: ya, but add each css selector section in the string to it in turn until it gives you 0
[11:00:33] <Cork> when it starts giving you 0 you know where the html differ and cause the selector not to work
[11:01:24] <galgamach> didn't quite catch that ...
[11:01:26] <galgamach> :-(
[11:01:47] <Cork> first run jQuery('.color-chooser-select').length
[11:01:55] <Cork> then jQuery('.color-chooser-select option').length
[11:02:00] <Cork> then jQuery('.color-chooser-select option[value=""]').length
[11:02:03] <Cork> and so on
[11:02:34] <Cork> when length == 0 you know where the selector stops finding the target
[11:03:52] <galgamach> of first one gives 1... second gives 2 and then 1 agaibn
[11:03:54] <galgamach> *again
[11:04:09] <Cork> the number of hits doesn't matter as long as it isn't 0
[11:04:10] <galgamach> jQuery('.color-chooser-select option[value="500"]').length   gives 1
[11:04:16] <Cork> uh
[11:04:22] <Cork> what?
[11:04:30] <Cork> where does 500 come from?
[11:05:05] <galgamach> if you see the fiddle there is also an <option value="500">Black</option>
[11:05:19] <Cork> ya, but the selector shouldn't try to match for that element
[11:05:44] <Cork> look at the selector string and validate what it selects
[11:07:12] <galgamach> jQuery('.color-chooser-select option[value=""] + option:last-child').length   this one still gives 1
[11:07:23] <Cork> hmm
[11:07:33] <galgamach> jQuery('.color-chooser-select option[value="500"] + option:last-child').length
[11:07:38] <galgamach> This one gives   0
[11:07:40] <galgamach> :-)
[11:07:57] <Cork> ya, cause that isn't meant to be used at all
[11:08:06] <galgamach> hmm
[11:08:23] <Cork> the first one is meant to select the first option as long as there is one
[11:08:42] <Cork> and that is how i read it as what the original code was meant to do
[11:11:26] <galgamach> Cork, :-(  I guess we run out of ideas huh ?
[11:34:43] <Cork> galgamach: is the url public?
[11:34:53] <Cork> cause i can't help you unless i can see the problem

[14:37:27] <jquery129> I'm trying to append information from HTML into another div element programatically. I keep only seeing the same href, does anyone have any idea how I can fix this? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PjEEYN
[14:38:20] <jquery129> For reference: I want to get each 'link' from the divs below my bridge, then append them onto their respective dots in the bridge

[15:12:15] <GeekMonkey> I have an array that changes when you click different buttons
[15:12:33] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to filter some elements based on the classes in the array
[15:13:00] <GeekMonkey> it works with one class but not multiple classes
[15:13:03] <GeekMonkey> any help?

[15:21:08] <rapha> hi
[15:22:18] <rapha> given https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/8e9a0ea8888a14e77efefa1892891e62, why does $(this).closest('.level_1') (with "this" being the last <a>) not find that <li>? and how would i find it if i don't know how deep inside that tree i am?
[15:35:12] <rapha> (or is there any way i can debug/print the DOM as jquery's parents() and children() methods see it?)
[15:40:32] <shoky_> rapha: the last <a> is not a descendant of .level_1   .closest() only finds parents/ancestors
[15:42:51] <shoky_> if you want to find the top <ul>'s  child <li> , then give that top <ul> a class
[16:02:00] <jquery783> How can I set a variable in a loop, so that if I reference the variable, it will show up in the correct element?
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:08:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery783 what do you mean?
[16:13:04] <jquery783> So I have 2 groups of elements, group 1 "circle+k" is static, while group 2 "step+i" is dynamically added. I run an each function on them to give them classes like 'circle1, circle2, etc..' and 'step1, step2, etc'
[16:13:52] <jquery783> then I run jquery .eq() to append a class of "filled". I am trying to take all the elements with filled and wrap them in the link for their relevant div. ie: step 1's link is relevant to circle1, etc
[16:14:19] <jquery783> Here is a mockup that can probably better explain it: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ogzzrx?editors=0010
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> so coupla questions.
[16:16:59] <jquery783> go for it
[16:17:01] <robertmaxrees> why not just setup the relationship in the backend?
[16:17:11] <Braden`> Hello
[16:17:13] <robertmaxrees> and then use data attributes to point them to one another?
[16:17:19] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/6Ew9utui <-- Updated paste.  AJAX request is not being sent.  Any insight would be appreciated
[16:17:49] <jquery783> the rssfeed is coming from a seperate url, so I can't access any part of the "hs-rss-item" div
[16:18:34] <robertmaxrees> Braden` open your console and submit.
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> Braden` ezpz problem - probably getting that error because you're reusing the photo id.
[16:19:07] <jquery783> I have the relationships working, in terms of filling in the circle when each div is in the html, but the relationship of "this rss-item's url" is not
[16:21:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery783 so if you have the relationships working, where's the problem?
[16:22:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry, getting lost here hahaha
[16:22:26] <jquery783> No worries, i'll update that link to be a little more clear one sec
[16:23:16] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  I am using the web console as part of the developer tools
[16:23:29] <robertmaxrees> Braden` so then you see the js error?>
[16:23:40] <Braden`> There is no js error
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing one when i make a fiddle >.>
[16:24:44] <jquery783> robertmaxrees: Here is a little more tirmmed down where you can see, since I have 2 items in the 'rss-fed' section, it is highlighting it on the map. https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/NgXYxW?editors=0010
[16:25:36] <jquery783> What I'm trying to do is catch the url in the title of the rss-fed item, and apply a wrap around the matching circle
[16:29:32] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused still - if you already have that relationship, then this should be easy, no?
[16:30:08] <jquery783> Well if I try to catch it by using (this) it doesn't seem to work, I'm not entirely sure how to go about it
[16:30:27] <MaxLeiter> hey, I have a bunch of [data-target="blah"] elements, and in my js i have 'blah'
[16:30:47] <MaxLeiter> how can I $("[data-target=${variable}]")?
[16:30:51] <rapha> shoky_: sorry, had to change trains. Thank you for the answer!
[16:30:56] <MaxLeiter> s/"/`/
[16:35:25] <robertBusy> MaxLeiter $("[data-target=${vari
[16:35:26] <robertBusy> able}]")?
[16:35:28] <robertBusy> woops one sec.
[16:35:33] <MaxLeiter> oh, duh
[16:35:35] <MaxLeiter> well ill test
[16:35:45] <robertBusy> $("[data-target=" + variable + "]")?
[16:35:48] <MaxLeiter> wait no thats what im doing
[16:35:56] <MaxLeiter> template literals should work
[16:35:56] <robertBusy> yeah tthat's why i said "one sec" ;)
[16:36:09] <robertBusy> then use a tempalte literal instead?
[16:36:11] <MaxLeiter> I don't think I can specify the actual attribute (i.e. after the =)
[16:36:24] <robertBusy> MaxLeiter huh?
[16:38:01] <MaxLeiter> maybe I have to do like $("[data-target]").data().equals?
[16:38:04] <MaxLeiter> er, ==
[16:38:29] <MaxLeiter> idk
[16:40:06] <MaxLeiter> I think i need quotes around ${} Robdgreat
[16:40:14] <MaxLeiter> oh, he left
[16:40:18] <MaxLeiter> sorry for accidental ping ^
[17:54:55] <fiord> hey all
[17:59:52] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[18:44:00] <Audlex> is this valid? $('#UserForm_Form_action_process').attr('onClick', "ga('send', 'event', ' CONTACT FORM ', 'Click', 'CONTACT FORM')");
[18:45:39] <robertmaxrees> err.  why not just use .on() ?
[18:46:17] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/894d7a2a6e24
[21:44:21] <latemus> i am using .load() to load a form.html. immediately after this, .val fails to set the value of a hidden input in said form. Am i correct in assuming that this connot be fixed with an event dereference, since the input is from another file i .load()-ed? how can i solve this
[21:46:45] <latemus> on second thought, event dereference should work here, correct?
[21:48:43] <latemus> since .load and .html both append the dom tree, right?
[22:12:23] <latemus> i tried to delegate to $('body').on('load', ...), and failed. very last section of http://termbin.com/aw0t
[22:20:59] <latemus> hm. okay looks like .load() event does not bubble
[22:24:26] <latemus> is the fix to trigger a custom event?
