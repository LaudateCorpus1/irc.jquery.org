[04:18:12] <adasr3> gonna clear cache try again
[08:53:39] <chazy> hi, i'm requesting data from my server using ajax get call, i can see the json data if i output it to the console, but after i assign for example myVar = data.anotherObject (previously `declared let myVar = {};` outside the $.get() method) if i output myVar to the console then it's undefined
[08:53:41] <chazy> any idea why?
[08:58:11] <Rotfuchs> let-declared variables are only in scope in the current group, so this might be the problem
[08:58:45] <chazy> https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/7fa5c1528c0da7cd44e84557468655b6
[09:00:02] <chazy> even when $.get() is in the same scope?
[09:00:19] <Rotfuchs> Yes
[09:00:39] <Rotfuchs> Are you sure data is decoded from JSON to an object?
[09:01:47] <chazy> do i need to decode the JSON data i get from the server?
[09:02:50] <Rotfuchs> I think the default is "guess the correct format", so this might fail. It's better to explicitly tell it the format you expect
[09:05:52] <chazy> hmm should accessing the JSON data object using ['key'] mess with the object?
[09:06:23] <chazy> cuz that's the reason it's undefined, not using let or var
[09:09:09] <Rotfuchs> I don't understand that question. JSON is transferred as string, you have to make sure it's correctly decoded into an object afterwards
[09:09:10] <chazy> https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/7fa5c1528c0da7cd44e84557468655b6
[09:09:48] <chazy> what's the problem with accessing one property with [] and the other without?
[09:11:22] <Rotfuchs> This makes no sense. What is "// ..."?
[09:12:55] <chazy> just 2 different cases
[09:13:13] <chazy> the first case works fine, the second dosn't the reason being using []
[09:13:44] <chazy> if i comment that line then i  no longer get undefined
[09:19:06] <chazy> my bad there was a variable with same name way up in the code, coudln't see it...
[12:59:35] <snatcher> how can i set data-custom attribute affected by css without value? .attr('data-custom', '') showed with empty value as data-custom="" instead just data-custom
[13:00:03] <robertmaxrees> "affected by css"?
[13:00:14] <robertmaxrees> snatcher mind showing us what you mean?
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> snatcher are you trying to set a data attribute as if it were a boolean attribute?
[13:18:40] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/gxz3pLkd
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> snatcher so i'm guessing you're expecting that alert to return 0, yeah?
[13:20:17] <snatcher> yes
[13:20:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not gonna work.  .prop() sets DOM properties - that won't change any attributes, so you can't select using CSS selectors.
[13:21:38] <snatcher> *how can i set data-custom attribute affected by css selectors without value?
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> are you actually trying to style an element based on a boolean data attribute
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:27:50] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/3bxpdva8/
[13:28:41] <robertmaxrees> are you actually trying to style an element based on a boolean data attribute?
[13:29:14] <robertmaxrees> or are you trying to use that data attribute in some other way?
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> snatcher
[13:31:00] <robertmaxrees> snatcher i'm trying to figure out what exactly you're trying to do to see if it's even possible.
[13:32:30] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: some other (non-jquery depended) script result depends on boolean data attributes, what i'm trying to figure out how to set data attribute without value like in second <input> from jquery, <input id="i" data-d> instead <input id="i" data-d="">
[13:32:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can't really do that :/
[13:32:52] <snatcher> why?
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> because you can't.
[13:33:23] <robertmaxrees> you can set boolean properties using .prop(), but you can't select those using CSS>
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> .attr() won't work because it's expecting a value.
[13:33:50] <snatcher> on js-level or jquery-level? what a strange restriction
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> .data() won't work because that's completely separate.
[13:34:11] <robertmaxrees> might be a missing feature in jquery.
[13:34:29] <robertmaxrees> but also: using boolean data attributes is a little unusual :)
