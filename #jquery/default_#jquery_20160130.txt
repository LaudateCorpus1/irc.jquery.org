[05:05:26] <uskerine> (that's the actual code)
[05:23:38] <uskerine> instead of doing $('#myButton').click( function() { ... } );    can I just call directly another function such as     $('#myButton').click(   myFunction(this)  );    ?
[05:23:59] <uskerine> I have tried and it does not work, it actually launches myFunction(this), what is wrong there?

[10:16:08] <pihpah> I get the error Error: An invalid or illegal string was specified on $(document).trigger('MyCustomEvent')
[10:16:11] <pihpah> Why?
[10:26:45] <pihpah> Question dismissed
[10:46:14] <SpecialTechnique> shoky: yea, I meant that it defaults to false
[10:46:34] <SpecialTechnique> but I also learned that clone() won't pass events if it's from click(function()
[10:46:45] <SpecialTechnique> rather, it'll work with on('click',
[10:47:02] <SpecialTechnique> Hey drej
[11:03:29] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: .click(function is just a shortcut to .on('click', function
[11:35:37] <SpecialTechnique> shoky: I'm trying to test a functionality on my site to see how it will look/work prior to building it. I cloned an element that has a click -> ajax/modal event bind to it. I set my clone to true to pass the event in order to create a new button with a different style. However, the click event won't work on the clone target.
[11:37:19] <SpecialTechnique> It does work if I append a new button with this: onclick="modalPop=function(){$('.wl-open-dialog').click()}; modalPop();" - the issue with that, is that it opens all the ajax/modals. I tried event.stopPropagation(); to stop it from opening all of them, but that actually just stopped it from opening at all.
[12:17:49] <SpecialTechnique> shoky: if you answered, sorry I got dc.
[12:39:58] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: i'd need to see a testcase/jsfiddle showing the problem
[12:43:41] <SpecialTechnique> hmm

[21:06:41] <labsy> hi all
[21:06:46] <labsy> does anybody use ace editor?
[21:07:09] <labsy> I have a really strange problem. I can not call ace.edit() on an id with a name other than "editor"
[21:07:17] <labsy> only ace.editor("editor") works. nothing else.
[21:07:20] <labsy> any hints?
[21:07:52] <labsy> ah fuck. I know why
[21:07:58] <labsy> ok. thanks anyway.
