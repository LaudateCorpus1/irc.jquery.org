[15:15:18] <destramic> how do i call a element added into  the dom
[15:30:17] <pavonia> ".delete-smoke-alarm is a dom added element and cannont be called by its class name .delete-smoke-alarm" <-- Why?
[15:47:13] <destramic> $('.delete-smoke-alarm'); wont work, the element is added to the dom
[15:52:28] <destramic> https://pastebin.com/Y3w8EF5G figured it out, thank you
[15:59:20] <pavonia> Why not just $('body').on('click', '.delete-smoke-alarm', ...)?
[16:00:20] <pavonia> Also there are spelling errors in your code ($target vs. $traget)
[16:22:04] <destramic> thank you, sorry pav i dunno what you mean...why not just ...
