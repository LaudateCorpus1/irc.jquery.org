[05:56:03] <aasutossh> Hi, I am working with jquery ui autocomplete widget. I want to search for the query in two locations. Sadly I couldn't specify two sources. Also I tried to use single source function to return two values, but only one values were showed. The code is at https://termbin.com/k1kt. PS. the mapbox key is wrong.
[05:56:14] <aasutossh> I am desperate.
[05:56:28] <aasutossh> I want to search and get autocomplete results from two sources.
[05:56:58] <Cork> aasutossh: you have to use a custom rendering function
[05:58:01] <aasutossh> WHat do you mean Cork ?
[05:58:29] <aasutossh> You mean this https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryui/jqueryui_autocomplete.htm#extension_renderItem
[05:58:37] <aasutossh> ?
[05:58:40] <Cork> yes
[05:58:59] <Cork> the default function only checks value if i remember correctly
[05:59:52] <aasutossh> If I comment any one of them out, the autocomplete works. Either names variable works or the mapbox search results.
[06:00:20] <aasutossh> I thought it needs to be used if you want to modify how it looks.
[06:01:03] <aasutossh> If you have array as a source then it doesn't require to render differently.
[06:03:15] <Cork> aasutossh: ya, cause the default _renderItem checks for [value, value, value] or [{value:""}, {value:""}, {value:""}] (think there is one more format, but the api page is 502 right now)
[06:03:31] <Cork> https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[06:03:43] <Cork> its has a list of the different formats autocomplete support by default
[06:04:07] <Cork> if you have another format, list multiple values; you need a custom renderItem
[06:04:26] <Cork> list==like
[06:06:28] <aasutossh> But formatting is not really the issue here, or is it? I am confused. I don't want to modify how it looks, I want to get the both results in autocomplete widget. Which I am not able to get them both.
[06:06:32] <Cork> https://web.archive.org/web/20200525164741/https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[06:07:20] <Cork> aasutossh: you can send as many values as you want into the autocomplete, it will only display {label:} or ["", ""] by default though
[06:07:39] <Cork> so if it isn't one of those formats it won't be visible in the dropdown
[06:07:44] <aasutossh> https://stackoverflow.com/a/5079268 check out this answer.
[06:08:08] <aasutossh> But I have the format correct? Or no?
[06:08:22] <Cork> depends on what you want
[06:08:55] <Cork> you can provide a concated string to autocomplete insted of handling it in renderItem, but then it will be a joined value instead of two
[06:09:26] <Cork> my recommendation is to have something like { val1: value, val2: value} in source and let renderItem format it correctly for the dropdown
[06:09:53] <Cork> it is what it is there for after all
[06:10:13] <aasutossh> well I thought about merging the both results. but each autocomplete results are returned as a separate object rather than all in one object.
[06:10:35] <Cork> you can't do that
[06:10:59] <Cork> ther response method is expected to be called once
[06:11:17] <Cork> $.when can help you there
[06:11:31] <Cork> (if you need multiple ajax calls i mean)
[06:14:44] <aasutossh> i'm kinda confused with this render logic.
[06:15:46] <haroldjfks> hello, about an iframe: while on chrome console if I do $('#myframeID').contents().find('.specific_class').hide(); works, if I do that on the javascript code for the html page, it doesn't work
[06:16:06] <haroldjfks> I tried the document ready and the on load for the iframe...but nothing
[06:16:11] <haroldjfks> what may be the issue, please?
[06:17:11] <Cork> aasutossh: when search is called source is called, when response is called _renderMenu is called and it calls _renderItem for each entry in the dropdown
[06:17:30] <Cork> aasutossh: when the user clicks an entry or enter or similar select is called
[06:18:22] <Cork> haroldjfks: your most likely calling it in the page before the iframe content has loaded
[06:18:30] <aasutossh> Yeah, that's what I thought. But I told you I have each of them working if used separately. But doesn't work when used both together. I still can't see how _renderItem is an issue here.
[06:18:34] <Cork> haroldjfks: you have to wait for the load event from the iframe before you can access it
[06:19:04] <Cork> aasutossh: you have to call response once, and it sounds like you call it once per source
[06:19:17] <Cork> you have to provide one array with all values in
[06:19:40] <Cork> and if you want multiple values per entry you want [{value1, value2, value3...}]
[06:20:07] <Cork> and then format the result appropriatly in _renderItem
[06:20:36] <Cork> (as in select what key to put where in the item list in the dropdown)
[06:23:05] <Cork> ex. _renderItem = function(item) { return [ '<div>', item.name, '<br><i>', item.customer.name, '</i></div>' ].join('') ).appendTo(ul); };
[06:23:34] <Cork> anyway
[06:23:36] * Cork afk
[06:23:51] <aasutossh> Cork: yes I called response two times in the source function. One for mapbox results one for names variable. So you mean, I should combine them both results into one array? then use _renderItem to show them in the front end?
[06:25:15] <Cork> aasutossh: yes, that is exactly what i said
[06:25:38] <aasutossh> I'll do it. Thank you for your assistance. <3
[06:25:39] <Cork> response triggers the rendering of the renderMenu and it will remove the old result
[06:26:10] <Cork> if you have multiple async source use $.when to wait for all of them
[06:26:21] <Cork> *sources*
[06:29:09] <aasutossh> Yes sir.
[06:30:25] <aasutossh> Btw can I use different _renderItem for results from different source? I mean they both don't return similar object structures.
[06:58:41] <Cork> aasutossh: no, but you can check if the key exists in the object and switch based on that
[06:59:58] <Cork> if(obj.hasOwnProperty('key')) {} else {}
[07:03:02] <aasutossh> Sounds good.
[07:14:43] <aasutossh> Still can't make it work.
[07:21:22] <Cork> aasutossh: side note, why are you using the node method textContent instead of the dom innerText?
[07:22:27] <aasutossh> I am just starting with js and children. I saw that on SO. So I used it.
[07:22:43] <Cork> would recommend to use innerText instead
[07:22:57] <aasutossh> Sure.
[07:23:38] <aasutossh> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryui/jqueryui_autocomplete.htm the last example, I am getting error Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "data", this._renderItem(...) is undefined
[07:23:44] <aasutossh> Is that tutorial too old?
[07:24:49] <Cork> no that looks about right
[07:27:24] <aasutossh> https://termbin.com/evz5 error pops up. Maybe some syntax error?
[07:31:10] <Cork> yes you have to always return something and your else case is missing
[07:35:53] <aasutossh> Nice. Also, I should also be able to use for loops to iterate the items in the response mixed data? I'll try.
[07:41:06] <Cork> aasutossh: $.each(), $.map or .forEach is the more modern replacements for those
[07:48:26] <codecutter> how do i check if i'm connected/disconnected to the internet?
[07:50:14] <orbitex> hi there. I need to somehow create a code in function.php in order to add to all elements like <iframe>code</iframe> to become like <a href=""><iframe>code</a></iframe>
[07:50:23] <orbitex>  <a href=""><iframe>code</iframe></a>
[07:50:31] <orbitex> the last one is the correct
[07:50:37] <Cork> codecutter: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine
[07:50:48] <orbitex> what i have done is to have it like that
[07:50:53] <Cork> but it is an estimate it doesn't always return the correct info
[07:50:55] <orbitex>  <div id="iframe-overlay-div"><iframe src="url" width="1600" height="2600"></iframe></div>
[07:51:02] <orbitex> i need somehow to use js in a .js file so that I can make the whole iframe-overlay-div to click it and link to another site
[07:51:10] <orbitex> i have created the js file and linked it to wordpress using functions.php to include the file
[07:51:18] <orbitex> i also print a console.log "hello"
[07:51:25] <orbitex> but i dont know how to add code to make the overlay clickable
[07:51:34] <orbitex> any help will be greatly appreciated
[07:51:44] <Cork> orbitex: you can't click grab iframes
[07:52:04] <Cork> its considered click hijacking
[07:52:28] <orbitex> Cork, I just want for the iframe to be showing another site, if someone clicks anywhere in the iframe, i want to redirect them to that site
[07:52:38] <orbitex> like open in new tab
[07:52:47] <Cork> ya == clickj hijacking
[07:52:54] <Cork> -j
[07:54:31] <codecutter> cork: will this work for a direct message chat window like twitter? i.e. when 2 people are engaged in a conversation and the internet is cut off for one of them, i need it to auto detect and establish the connection by sending a ajax request to update chat?
[07:54:33] <orbitex> is it possible? I want to redirect the user to the original url that the iframe is showing and be any more to my site
[07:55:18] <Cork> codecutter: that value is based on if the browser consideres that it has access to network or is offline
[07:55:33] <Cork> it is fairly fussy in what it actually means
[07:55:49] <codecutter> how do twitter do thei?
[07:55:53] <codecutter> theirs*
[07:56:33] <Cork> most likely they use something like websocket webrtc to connect and base it on that get the connection state
[07:56:45] <codecutter> sse?
[07:56:50] <Cork> *websocket or webrtc*
[07:56:58] <Cork> sse is just long ajax polls
[07:57:00] <codecutter> will sse work?
[07:57:03] <codecutter> aw
[07:57:04] <Cork> not really
[07:57:17] <codecutter> dayum thats what i went with
[07:57:36] <Cork> sse closes the connection for each message sent
[07:57:43] <orbitex> Cork can I pm you a link that shows what I am trying to achieve?
[07:57:43] <Cork> so it is expected to lose connection to the server a lot
[07:59:10] <codecutter> right, which is why i need a reliable way to check if i'm still connected or not, when disconnected i can then poll the server on reconnect, not the best approach but should work, right?
[07:59:50] <Cork> well you will have to have a "acceptable amount of disconnected time" for that to work
[08:00:13] <Cork> as there is always a max connection time for ajax pulls
[08:00:24] <Cork> and reconnecting after that can take a few seconds
[08:00:52] <codecutter> you're saying i should change it to websocket?
[08:01:25] <Cork> codecutter: i'm saying you should research what you require and select solution based on that
[08:01:47] <Cork> websocket does not jive very welll with php last i checked so that might be a showstopper
[12:01:38] <audioburn> anyone hiring remote US devs?
[14:51:09] <wimpog> I'm looking for a JS library for building flowcharts (or UML diagrams) that could also send information to the server, like a node added, next, prev node, etc.
