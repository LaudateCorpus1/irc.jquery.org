[02:39:27] <linux_daemon> hello, has anyone worked with dangrosmann/daterangepicker plugin? i want to inferse the selected dates, but cant seem to find a way. for ex: i click on October 20 as first date, and second click is on October 10, so in this case i want it inverte. now, it just stays at October 20
[02:39:38] <linux_daemon> at this poing, another plugin is not an option
[02:39:43] <linux_daemon> point*
[02:58:53] <igik> hey. looking for some help with JQuery.ajax() - is this the right place to ask questions?
[02:59:05] <Cork> yes
[03:01:02] <igik> thanks. ok so i'm using an ajax POST call to a web server within my Cordova app (jquery 3.2.1). Most of the calls happen without issues, but one of the calls Saves a document on the server
[03:01:38] <Cork> ajax can't do anything on the server
[03:01:46] <Cork> if something happens there, it is cause the server does it
[03:01:54] <Cork> ajax just makes url requests
[03:02:14] <igik> the issue is, after about 2min, it seems that a second ajax call is triggered (it catches a break-point on the server)
[03:02:43] <Cork> igik: there are no resend built in ajax either
[03:03:00] <Cork> so either the server makes a 3xx response or you rerun the ajax call for some reason
[03:03:27] <igik> would a 3xx cause a second ajax call?
[03:04:02] <Cork> if the server sends a 3xx and a location header the browser would request the url (not ajax)
[03:04:11] <Cork> it is transparently done by the browser
[03:15:14] <igik> when i view my network panel in Chrome, i don't see any 3xx, but i do see a 101?
[03:33:57] <Cork> hmm that is switch protocol
[03:34:29] <Cork> you would have to check in the headers and body to see what it does that for (i don't think i've ever had a server give me 1xx)
[04:28:12] <igik> thanks for the feedback. after more research it seems the issue might be related to a socket.io "double connection" issue.
[15:18:13] <Flyste> I'm trying to have jquery trigger a .play() .attr('src'..) and have them so the image changes at the same time, but the .attr change doesn't seem to happen until after the sound is done playing.  Is there a way to make them happen at the same time?
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> can you show us your code?
[15:18:46] <Flyste> One sec..
[15:19:29] <Flyste> https://jsfiddle.net/zfehqscm/
[15:19:39] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:19:56] <Flyste> http://test.platinumpetsusa.com/platinum-protection-2/
[15:19:58] <robertmaxrees> holy cow.
[15:20:00] <Flyste> There's the actual page
[15:20:53] <Flyste> If you click on the first big image it triggers what I'm trying to do
[15:21:17] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[15:21:22] <Flyste> Firefox
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't put this in the fiddle?
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> oh, and your issue is pretty straightforward.
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> the image is already PlatinumProtectionAnimation1.png - you want to make it the second image.
[15:29:24] <robertmaxrees> Flyste
[15:29:40] <Flyste> Interesting
[15:29:59] <robertmaxrees> also: this is a really ugly way to do this.  why not use a recursive function to do this instead?
[15:30:02] <robertmaxrees> or just use a gif?
[15:30:45] <Flyste> How would you use a recursive function?
[15:31:58] <robertmaxrees> set some kind of iterator, call the function which sets the timeout, increment the number, set the image source, play the sound, then call that function again.
[15:32:53] <Flyste> Yeah I suppose I could do that
[15:34:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hfvzLuea/1/ not perfect (would need to handle that initial one, but 90% there ;)
[18:09:19] <on3pk> Does $.when() have all the typical promise type functions.  I.e., does it have .then(), .fail() etc?
[18:10:05] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  and if you're on jquery 3.x, it's fully promises compliant.
[18:11:40] <on3pk> thanks.
[18:12:14] <on3pk> From what I've read, .fail() fires as soon as one promise fails.  Is it therefore advisable to use .then(success(), fail())?
[18:12:37] <robertmaxrees> i would use .then().catch()
[18:12:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing the two args to .then()
[18:14:10] <on3pk> Okay
[18:14:21] <on3pk> I will do that.  Thank you
[18:14:32] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[18:14:42] <on3pk> But curious, is there a reason to only pass one arg to .then()?
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> if there's an error within the "success" function, your first way won't properly handle it.
[18:16:08] <robertmaxrees> if you chain the .catch() on, it will.
[18:16:37] <on3pk> ah.  That makes sense
[18:16:41] <on3pk> thanks
