[05:37:12] <MACscr> hmm, shouldnt line 26 of the javascript work here? http://jsfiddle.net/pvn6nfxg/9/. Its updating the id just fine, but not the data attribute value
[06:01:36] <vish93> Hey guys I would like to incoperate OwlCarousel2 with jquery lazyload but it doesn’t seem to be working too well: https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/pen/VxQqXx like the main slider now is extended past the height of the image, and loads image from the carousel not yet in view. Is there a way to fix this?
[07:48:40] <tipu> anyone? need little help
[07:48:43] <tipu>  i am trying to click on the button through console(writing a script) ... but not able to do it (https://medium.com/tag/blockchain/latest)
[07:48:57] <tipu>  $(".clapButton").click()
[07:49:22] <tipu> i am trying to click on clap button through console on that page
[07:49:31] <tipu> but it's not working
[07:50:01] <MikeD_> click() is how you register a click listener, it accepts a function to callback
[07:50:11] <MikeD_> what you are looking for is .trigger('click')
[07:52:04] <tipu> thanks @naki444 but when i am using trigger this happening "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).trigger is not a function"
[07:52:15] <tipu> sorry mike
[07:52:47] <tipu> i am using it in dev console ..but it should work
[07:53:29] <tipu> methods like $("clapButton").data('action') is also saying that data is not a function
[07:53:39] <tipu> same with attr function
[07:53:50] <tipu> is it problem of console or something else
[07:54:33] <MikeD_> when you write $("clapButton") you are trying to find the element with a tagname of "clapButton"
[07:55:39] <MikeD_> is that a class or an id?
[07:55:39] <tipu> sorry $(".clapButton") forgot the . i am funding it with class name than trying to click on it
[07:56:07] <tipu> clapButton is class and i am using . to get it and i am getting it but click is not happening
[07:56:31] <tipu> you can check it on this page https://medium.com/tag/blockchain/latest
[07:56:58] <preference> you mean the class is called "clapButton", and you've tried .clapButton('click')?
[07:57:17] <tipu> wait
[07:58:34] <tipu> yes class is clapButton and i am trying $(".clapButton").trigger('click')
[07:58:48] <tipu> getting this "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).trigger is not a function"
[07:59:59] <preference> i'm pretty sure it's $('.clapButton').click()
[08:00:05] <preference> when i execute this in console, it works
[08:00:43] <MikeD_> yeah, i mislead you because i have only ever seen .click( function(){ } )
[08:01:08] <preference> tipu: is this what you wanted?
[08:01:38] <tipu> i wanted to click on that clap button through console..but not working..what code worked in your console
[08:01:42] <preference> $('.clapButton').click()
[08:01:45] <preference> this, exactly this
[08:01:54] <preference> this brings up a pop-up saying you need an account to clap
[08:02:02] <tipu> did this increased the clap count
[08:02:08] <MikeD_> what browser
[08:02:15] <tipu> ok i am logged in
[08:02:25] <tipu> chrome
[08:02:27] <preference> i'm not logged in
[08:02:30] <preference> i'm using chrome OSX
[08:02:35] <tipu> did you want to check by logged in
[08:02:42] <preference> no, because i'm not going to create an account
[08:02:43] <tipu> i am using ubunut 16.10
[08:02:49] <tipu> ohhh
[08:02:51] <preference> try logging out and then executing
[08:03:06] <tipu> 1 sec
[08:03:54] <tipu> yes it's working while logged out
[08:04:02] <tipu> but not when i am logged in
[08:04:19] <preference> it's working when you're logged in
[08:04:22] <preference> but it's not giving the output you expect
[08:04:59] <preference> or maybe there's something else going on that you need to investigate. try clicking on the button manually with your mouse and see if you can listen for other events
[08:05:14] <preference> websites do all sorts of stupid shit nowadays in an attempt to track literally everything
[08:05:39] <MikeD_> nowadays?  it's been going on for at least 10 years  :P
[08:05:49] <preference> nowhere near as prevalent
[08:05:50] <tipu> ok let me check that....it's really frustrating sometime when simple things don't work
[08:09:54] <tipu> thats click event only ..when a using event breakpoint on mouse click ..it's stopping there..they have minified the th source file..unreadable
[08:10:59] <preference> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[08:10:59] <preference> you can try using this tool
[08:11:06] <preference> but nothing much more you can do
[08:11:08] <preference> welcome to black box testing
[08:13:18] <preference> tipu: as a last resort, you may be able to execute the callback function directly somehow, but if they're already hiding everything, they've probably made that pretty difficult, too
[08:15:21] <tipu> grrrrrrrr .... :D
[08:27:04] <tipu> this worked
[08:27:06] <tipu> var ev = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'); ev.initEvent('mousedown', true, true); $('.clapButton').dispatchEvent(ev)
[08:36:10] <ryan_ford> speaking of creepy tracking, have any of you seen this? https://clickclickclick.click/
[08:36:31] <ryan_ford> off topic, many sorries
[09:24:58] <Cyclohexane> Does .focus() automatically scroll to inputs that are not in view? (cause that's what seems to be happening)
[09:25:48] <preference> that would make sense
[09:27:27] <Cyclohexane> anyway to stop it doing that? i.e. set the cursor so you can type when you're ready but don't scroll?
[09:32:53] <preference> workarounds, but no option for it
[10:06:03] <ryan_ford> I'm curious, why you would want that behavior Cyclohexane
[10:06:44] <Cyclohexane> ryan_ford: it scrolls past all the content that you need to read to know what to write in the input box
[10:07:26] <ryan_ford> it take's a handler doesn't it? couldn't you set the scroll position where you want it to go?
[10:07:52] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/jquery/focus
[10:09:20] <ryan_ford> or I guess you would need to set the handler before you trigger/call it without arguments
[10:09:52] <Cyclohexane> yeah
[10:14:25] <ryan_ford> honestly, it does kind of seem like a bad idea though. if it's not in view when you're creating the focus, maybe you just shouldn't add focus at that time
[10:15:03] <preference> the whole point of focus is to clearly display what should be looked at (focussed on)
[10:18:00] <ryan_ford> and you're going to be messing with accessibility for people who navigate with tab
[10:19:48] <preference> personally, any website which takes control away from me pisses me off
[10:20:06] <preference> i would never force focus on something unless it was in an attempt to help a user find something
[10:20:31] <Cyclohexane> yeah im going to leave it
[10:20:39] <Cyclohexane> i was just trying to figure out why it was scrolling
[10:20:51] <Cyclohexane> doesn't seem to mention in the docs that it will scroll if it's not in view
[10:21:39] <preference> which docs are you looking at?
[10:23:19] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/dom/htmlelement/focus
[10:23:23] <ryan_ford> maybe this would help
[10:24:04] <ryan_ford> vanilla takes a boolean argument to preventScroll ✨
[10:24:21] <Cyclohexane> that'll do it, thanks (:
[10:33:22] <vish93> Has anyone used owlcarousel with an external lazy loader ?
[10:34:17] <preference> not lazy loader
[10:34:22] <preference> but i use owl-carousel
[10:34:42] <preference> owl-carousel has lazy built in, though
[10:35:14] <vish93> preference: it doesn’t sadly consider veiwport eetc which would be wrothwhile
[10:35:37] <vish93> Trying to make it work with jquery.Lazy() to no avail https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/full/VxQqXx/
[10:38:29] <preference> vish93: afraid i can't help, sorry =/
[10:39:42] <vish93> preference: It’s okay, appriciate the response at least :)
[18:21:08] <naki444> I'm using Ajax to dynamically show content in Bootstrap tabs. When I submit a new student it always defaults back to the first tab. How can I remain on the current active tab after successful submission? https://paste.ee/p/ke4HI
[18:22:33] <taplar> before line 11, you would need to capture which student is currently selected, and after you replace the students with the updated markup, find the one that was selected and re-select him
[18:23:23] <taplar> or her
[18:23:31] <naki444> Hey taplar
[18:23:37] <taplar> aloha, :)
[18:24:54] <naki444> I could use  $('#tabs a.active').tab('show'); for example but the Ajax response in view source doesn't show any code so the selector can't find with anything?
[18:26:17] <naki444> taplar: FYI - The tabs are the class names and the tab content is the list of students for that class.
[18:26:19] <taplar> right, you have to find which one is shown before you change it, and have some way to identify where it is after it is changed
[18:27:09] <taplar> so the active class may tell you which tab is active now, but you need some way to know which student that is associated with, because I assume new students may not always be added to the bottom
[18:29:08] <naki444> What I am trying to achieve is if I was to choose tab 3 for example and then decide to add a student to this class it needs to stay on this tab upon successful submission. It always goes back to the first tab.
[18:29:35] <taplar> right...
[18:29:55] <taplar> but you're focus shouldn't be on "tab 3 is active"
[18:30:07] <taplar> it should be "i'm showing student named X", right?
[18:31:18] <naki444> I think the focus should be on what tab it is. The student list is irrelevant at this point?
[18:31:43] <taplar> But each tab is related to a particular student, no?
[18:32:13] <naki444> Each tab has a list of students not just 1 student.
[18:32:37] <taplar> ok, so adding a new student does not cause a reordering of tabs then?
[18:33:27] <naki444> No.
[18:33:33] <naki444> I can show you a pic
[18:33:57] <taplar> If that's the case, then yeah, finding the position of the one that is active can work fine
[18:37:34] <naki444> https://imgur.com/a/noinZyi
[18:37:45] <naki444> Hope this helps explain a little better.
[18:38:34] <naki444> So if I click 'Add Student' it opens the modal and i can submit a student. If the submit is successful it should stay on this tab (Y13BUB).
[18:39:35] <taplar> can you show me the markup related to that particular tab?
[18:39:55] <taplar> *in the state that it is selected
[18:41:38] <naki444> When I view source the markup doesn't even show?
[18:41:38] <naki444> I guess that's because it's Ajax?
[18:41:38] <naki444> I can show you the console.log though.
[18:41:52] <taplar> you have to inspect the page, not view source
[18:42:09] <taplar> "Inspect Element" vs "View Source"
[18:42:26] <naki444> 2 secs.
[18:43:28] <naki444> https://paste.ee/p/YBSJ2
[18:44:06] <naki444> data-ajax is the id of the class in the database.
[18:44:52] <taplar> ok, even though you say it's not going to re-order, what I might do is find the a.active, but then grab it's id
[18:45:05] <naki444> Ok, thanks.
[18:45:05] <taplar> then when you go to set it back, that's an easy selector for the one you want to make active
[18:46:06] <naki444> I was trying to use this as well: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#events
[18:47:22] <taplar> you could potentially capture those events to get the active element and store it's id in a variable for future use, sure
[18:49:37] <naki444> Ok. I have tried a lot of different methods but none of them seem to work.
[18:50:00] <taplar> so start off with trying to get the id of the link that is selected
[18:50:12] <naki444> Do you think I could get the active tab within $("#register-student").on('submit', function(e) { ??
[18:50:54] <taplar> You need it inside the student() method, so if you did it inside the submit you would have to scope the variable higher than that method, or pass it into the students method, so it would be available in there
[18:51:07] <taplar> So i would probably just look it up inside the students method
[18:51:24] <taplar> but that's entirely up to your coding stle
[18:51:27] <taplar> *style
[18:51:44] <naki444> Ok.. would something like this work: var id = $("#tabs .nav-item a.active").attr("data-ajax");
[18:51:50] <naki444> Inside students();?
[18:53:32] <taplar> i would say grab the id, not the data-ajax
[18:53:48] <taplar> if you have the id, then selecting it again is as simple as $('#'+ variable)
[18:54:32] <naki444> Ok so if I do that inside students() I then need to retrieve it in ("#register-student") submit?
[18:54:57] <taplar> nope, since ids must be unique on the page
[18:55:44] <taplar> when you look up by id, you don't care what structure it is in.  the id is intended to uniquely identify an element no matter where it is
[18:56:26] <naki444> var id = $("#tabs a.active").attr("id");
[18:56:35] <naki444> I get returned undefined
[18:57:24] <taplar> and one of the links is selected?
[18:57:34] <taplar> try prop() rather than attr()
[18:57:52] <naki444> Yes first tab
[18:57:54] <taplar> well no that shouldn't matter
[18:58:22] <naki444> So will I not need to edit anything inside the $("#register-student") function?
[18:58:34] <taplar> nope
[18:58:50] <taplar> $() returns a reference to elements in the dom
[18:59:02] <naki444> Ok
[18:59:07] <naki444> So the focus is inside students();
[18:59:15] <taplar> i believe so
[18:59:34] <taplar> i'm fixing to have to jet again. :'(
[18:59:50] <naki444> var id = $("a.active").attr("id"); is returnign undefined.
[19:00:39] <taplar> what does console.log($('a.active').prop('outerHTML')) print?
[19:00:58] <taplar> and are you doing that before or after you replace the html of the students?
[19:02:40] <naki444> console.log($('a.active').prop('outerHTML')); not printing anything?
[19:03:02] <naki444> Wait
[19:03:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pn92d490/
[19:03:09] <naki444> I think it prints this: <a class="nav-link active show" id="Y9BUB-tab" data-ajax="2" data-toggle="tab" href="#Y9BUB" role="tab" aria-controls="Y9BUB" aria-selected="true">Y9BUB</a>
[19:03:52] <taplar> ok, so yeah the id should not be undefined when you register a new student
[19:04:00] <taplar> it may be on page load, but not when you register
[19:04:24] <naki444> You fiddle doesn't show anything in console log when I tried it.
[19:04:31] <taplar> but i gotta run.  others in the room may have a moment to help so hang around.
[19:04:36] <taplar> when you registered?
[19:04:43] <naki444> 2 secs
[19:04:56] <naki444> previously selected tab id: Y9BUB-tab
[19:04:59] <taplar> boom
[19:05:10] <naki444> Ok so now I can use this?
[19:05:40] <naki444> Sometihng like this: $('#tabs a[href="' + selectedId + '"]').tab('show');
[19:05:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pn92d490/1/  try that
[19:06:01] <naki444> ok 2 secs
[19:06:38] <naki444> I think I need to remove the active class of the first tab too..
[19:06:49] <taplar> the first tab is auto selected?
[19:07:10] <naki444> With your code it makes both tab 1 and tab 2 open
[19:07:48] <taplar> then yeah you may want to do that manually, or work out how to use the tab('show') logic with that selector some how so that bootstrap does the clearing of the first tab for you.  but i gotta run.  gl and catch you later! :D
[19:08:02] <naki444> Thanks man!
