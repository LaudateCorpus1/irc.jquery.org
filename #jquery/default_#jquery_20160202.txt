[00:23:54] <yogesh> Hi there
[01:17:43] <arc_> not really sure what's going on here
[01:18:44] <arc_> i have an element with data-ds-appid="395900" and i can't select it with $('*[data-ds-appid="395900"]'); in the console. it returns null
[01:18:52] <arc_> maybe i have the syntax wrong but i don't think i do
[01:23:44] <arc_> okay, something else is wrong here, so nevermind. $('a'); returns null
[02:19:50] <nru> i got: var newItemNumber = <?php echo $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] = $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] + 1; ?>;
[02:19:55] <nru> hi is it possible to put this: <?php echo $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] = $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] + 1; ?>; in to a javascript variable ?
[02:26:33] <dsdeiz> hi, would like to use .closest('input'); but for some reason it's selecting the same element.. it's somehow like this $('input).closest('input');
[04:06:24] <hellyeah> morning
[04:06:30] <hellyeah> anyone know about jqx calendar
[04:06:52] <hellyeah> i want to select a range more than once is there anyway to do that http://jsfiddle.net/nekck0cd/
[05:37:36] <PlanC> I have a menu which is showing and I want it to hide when a user clicks anywhere on the page EXCEPT for the menu
[05:37:57] <PlanC> so I'm doing a $(body).click() and hiding the menu
[05:38:02] <PlanC> it's working perfectly
[05:38:04] <PlanC> my only question is
[05:38:26] <PlanC> should I first run an if statement to check if the menu is showing and then hide it?
[05:38:53] <PlanC> will it cause any errors or is it bad practice to send the .hide() even when the element already is hidden?
[05:44:16] <DirtyFinn> it shouldn't cause error to tell it just to hide() without checking visibility first
[05:44:42] <DirtyFinn> in short: no. you're ok
[05:44:45] <DirtyFinn> :)
[05:46:48] <tuskkk___> On a certain click, I am trying to disable all other checkboxes, $(".checkbox-url:checkbox").attr("disabled", true); , but they are still ticking :(
[05:48:14] <DirtyFinn> try $(".checkbox-url:checkbox").prop("disabled", true);
[05:48:28] <DirtyFinn> so just changing the attr() into prop()
[05:49:26] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: still the same :(
[05:51:47] <DirtyFinn> how about $(".checkbox-url[type='checkbox']").prop("disabled", true); ?
[05:53:08] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: :( nope
[05:53:30] <DirtyFinn> can you show your code? the html and all?
[05:58:17] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: https://jsfiddle.net/7xj8auof/
[06:02:07] <DirtyFinn> https://jsfiddle.net/9om5xp7y/
[06:02:35] <DirtyFinn> tuskkk___, you had a problem at the on() method
[06:03:26] <tuskkk___> the second checkbox still ticks after you tick the first one :|
[06:04:12] <tuskkk___> on() seems same of both fiddles
[06:04:23] <DirtyFinn> shit
[06:04:26] <hellyeah> anyone know jqx calendar?
[06:04:32] <DirtyFinn> my changes didn't save :)
[06:04:38] <tuskkk___> oh
[06:04:45] <Trioxin> how can I run some code after an iframe has completed loading a page? I've tried this: http://hastebin.com/emikolecit.vhdl
[06:04:47] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: you probably know jqx calendar
[06:05:07] <hellyeah> :p
[06:05:24] <DirtyFinn> anyway change $(".review-box").on('change', '.checkbox-url', function () {    into   $(".checkbox-url").on('change', function () {
[06:06:24] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: but then, delagation will break, this page has results being loaded via ajax too
[06:07:12] <DirtyFinn> well your fiddle, nor you, said anything about that
[06:08:14] <PlanC> DirtyFinn: alright perfect, thanks for your answer :)
[06:08:22] <tuskkk___> I thought that was evident from the code, usage of a container class for on()
[06:08:24] <DirtyFinn> np :)
[06:08:50] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: can you help me :p
[06:09:19] <DirtyFinn> I don't know the calsendar
[06:09:29] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: but in any case, this doesn't work too, https://jsfiddle.net/9om5xp7y/1/
[06:10:57] <DirtyFinn> seems to work just fine http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qbypqX
[06:11:31] <Trioxin> meh. just put onload="" on the iframe which worked.. which i didn't want to do
[06:12:18] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: alright, and how do we make it work with delegation?
[06:13:57] <DirtyFinn> what you want to accomplish? what you want all this to do?
[06:14:23] <hellyeah> i want to implement my own calendar?
[06:14:58] <DirtyFinn> i want to eat
[06:15:09] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: the checkbox also submits a form, while the form is being submitted there is a slight delay which allows the user to check other boxes, so need to prevent that.
[06:16:03] <hellyeah> hnmn
[06:16:23] <hellyeah> you can disable checkboxes which are not clicked
[06:16:30] <hellyeah> all disable all of them?
[06:16:33] <hellyeah> or
[06:16:50] <DirtyFinn> all of them are already disabled
[06:16:54] <hellyeah> you can do some dialog or something on screen like please wait with overlay
[06:17:21] <hellyeah> overlat will avoid user to click any checkboxes
[06:19:08] <silverdust> Is there a way to check where the cursor is before using .focus() ?
[06:19:55] <tuskkk___> DirtyFinn: if they are disabled, then is there any way to prevent that tick from happeneing?
[06:20:22] <silverdust> foo.click(function(){ if(foo is in $('foobar')){ bar.focus(); }; })
[06:20:52] <DirtyFinn> you can't check or uncheck disabled checkbox. except from code
[06:24:01] <Trioxin> this is strange. I have a function attached to an iframe's onload which removes some elements from the DOM of the page that loads in the iframe. I have a splash screen that's supposed to fade out after the iframe loads. The DOM elements are removed after the iframe loads but even though I added $('#SplashScreen').fadeOut('slow'); after removing the elements, the splash screen goes away before the elements are removed.
[06:26:34] <tuskkk___> had a better solutions! Thanks for the time DirtyFinn!
[06:29:57] <Trioxin> I even tried putting that fade out line in its own function and using setTimeout(FadeSplash, 4000); but it immediately removes the splash div before performing the DOM element removals even though I call it after. it's like it's executing the lines in the function in reverse
[06:32:09] <Trioxin> here's all the code: http://hastebin.com/gitobucawa.xml
[06:42:20] <hellyeah> yo
[06:42:27] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: are you there?
[06:53:03] <dwindsor> first of all, google.com probably won't load in your iframe because of the sameorigin policy
[06:53:14] <dwindsor> try loading a different website, like youtube.com/embed
[06:54:29] <dwindsor> no time for further debugging, sorry!
[06:58:22] <hellyeah> any help here?
[06:58:39] <skyFlix> hellyeah: with?
[06:58:51] <hellyeah> let me try to explain
[07:00:32] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/41/pls create datepicker and select the dates you will see it is selected with random color in the below calendar and ppls create second datepicker click dates and you will see second date range will be selected with some color in the below calendar. But my problem is those dates selected in all calendar. How can i fix
[07:00:32] <hellyeah> that? Any help will be appreciated?
[07:02:47] <hellyeah> skyFlix: hope you understand my question?
[07:08:16] <cannap> guyzs!!
[07:09:40] <kostodo> I want to throw up a Yes/No selection on a .submit() with a preventDefault unless Yes is clicked.
[07:09:47] <kostodo> Whats a good way of doing that?
[07:17:43] <kostodo> Err how do I load jquery into jsfiddle?
[07:19:39] <kostodo> Ah :)
[07:19:54] <decx> click the gear in the javascript panel
[07:24:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:25:06] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/41/pls create datepicker and select the dates you will see it is selected with random color in the below calendar and ppls create second datepicker click dates and you will see second date range will be selected with some color in the below calendar. But my problem is those dates selected in all calendar. How can i fix
[07:25:06] <hellyeah> that? Any help will be appreciated?
[07:28:18] <decx> every time you do these 250 line fiddles, come on nobody's got time for that
[08:07:35] <shoky_> hellyeah: i'd try using the "special dates" feature instead of the setRange thing...
[08:09:44] <hellyeah> humm
[08:10:22] <hellyeah> special dates have tooltip feature that you hover over the special date
[08:10:45] <hellyeah> shoky_: pls check line 100 and 116 i need to get element as date any idea i hope? http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/44/
[08:12:07] <shoky_> hellyeah: you don't have to give them a tooltip. and you can give the special dates a class..
[08:12:26] <shoky_> which is exactly what you're looking for
[08:12:51] <shoky_> instead of your hack of setRange where you just set the background-color which obviously is problematic
[08:13:24] <cyberbrai> hello every one
[08:13:30] <cyberbrai> need small help on cron job manager
[08:13:35] <cyberbrai> 	in cron job manager how can i set the time of execution (0 0 0 * * *)
[08:13:39] <hellyeah> hmm special dates get the array also
[08:13:57] <hellyeah> shoky_: i will take a look at this
[08:14:07] <hellyeah> i hope special dates will handle the problem
[08:16:06] <shoky_> hellyeah arghhh i just did the special dates thing for you but the jsfiddle tab crashed and i didn't save :\
[08:16:19] <hellyeah> :P:P:P
[08:16:24] <shoky_> and jsfiddle's draft save thing is useless
[08:16:38] <hellyeah> browser history can remember that
[08:16:45] <hellyeah> did you save ever ? :P:P:P
[08:17:04] <shoky_> oh ok reopening the tab has it
[08:17:21] <hellyeah> thanks god :P:P:P
[08:17:24] <shoky_> forgot to increment the counter in the loop :)
[08:18:26] <hellyeah> doesnt it have increment feature auomatically?
[08:19:21] <hellyeah> anyway hmm i understadn
[08:19:30] <hellyeah> i take a look at special dates
[08:20:27] <hellyeah> hmm special dates get an array
[08:20:34] <hellyeah> i can give it date array
[08:20:57] <hellyeah> okey now i picturize smt on my mind
[08:21:11] <shoky_> hm it's not working for me like in their demo for some reason
[08:21:27] <hellyeah> what is console sayin
[08:22:06] <shoky_> ah you need to give it a new Date object for each call to addSpecialDate, pretty lame
[08:22:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:22:48] <hellyeah> why is it lame?
[08:23:00] <shoky_> hellyeah: anyways here's an example with 3 colors, you can add more (to the css , and change the numColors var)
[08:23:02] <shoky_> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/45/
[08:23:51] <hellyeah> well
[08:24:01] <hellyeah> i plan to use random hex code generator
[08:24:11] <hellyeah> and give the color with css function
[08:24:14] <hellyeah> is it okey?
[08:24:22] <shoky_> then you'll need to generate dynamic css or something..
[08:24:34] <shoky_> because it won't work the way it is now
[08:24:40] <shoky_> with fixed class names
[08:24:56] <shoky_> but why would you want a totally random color?
[08:25:14] <shoky_> you can have like 20 good options in your css (or however many you want)
[08:25:20] <shoky_> and choose a random one for each range
[08:25:26] <shoky_> sounds nicer to me
[08:25:51] <angularbangular> im trying to download this repot as a zip, and work on developing it...when i copy iy to wamp and load it, im not getting any styles or anything come up...do i need to configure something for this angular js app, to replicate it and work on it?
[08:26:02] <hellyeah> hmm user can create 100 datepickers for probably different person
[08:26:02] <angularbangular> https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio
[08:26:09] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:26:15] <hellyeah> i will smoke
[08:26:19] <shoky_> no, nobody will create 100 datepickers
[08:26:44] <shoky_> and if they will, i'm sure they won't mind that there aren't 100 different colors :)
[08:27:01] <hellyeah> ah okey
[08:27:17] <shoky_> but anyway you can create a dynamic <style>  element i guess if you really want it to be random :S
[08:27:21] <hellyeah> but thats why i aimed to use random hex generatır
[08:27:23] <shoky_> not gonna do that for you tho ;p
[08:27:42] <hellyeah> at least i showed some effort here
[08:27:44] <hellyeah> thanks
[08:27:59] <hellyeah> probably you wont help if you didnt see any effort
[08:28:18] <shoky_> probably. not that i really know if you're the one that wrote the new code ;p
[08:28:20] <hellyeah> so in that point i have a feeling i am getting better and better point
[08:29:00] <angularbangular> yo boys and girls, how do i use this repsoitory    https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio
[08:29:12] <hellyeah> i just dont understand specialNum and numColors
[08:29:29] <shoky_> you need to see the code that uses them, to understand them, obviously ;)
[08:29:57] <hellyeah> ah
[08:29:58] <hellyeah> ic
[08:29:59] <shoky_> i use them for choosing the class name to send to addSpecialDate
[08:30:09] <hellyeah> i understand
[08:30:20] <shoky_> in the css you can see 3 "special" classes at the top, i choose one of them
[08:30:39] <hellyeah> it is num of css class
[08:30:51] <hellyeah> good thinking really wise
[08:31:09] <hellyeah> unfortunately i dont have that kind of idea yet
[08:31:18] <hellyeah> hmm i need more practice for sure
[08:31:34] <hellyeah> and you do specialNum = 1 when it is bigger then numColors
[08:31:54] * hellyeah thums up
[08:32:13] <hellyeah> thanks shoky_ need to smoke now
[08:32:18] <shoky_> prob is i'm not sure this jqxCalendar has anything for removing the special dates
[08:32:30] <shoky_> if you want to change the ranges after already selecting some range
[08:32:33] <shoky_> np
[08:35:04] <hellyeah> well
[08:35:09] <hellyeah> i a m not sure either
[08:35:26] <hellyeah> if user wants to change dates after colorizing
[08:35:36] <hellyeah> i need to remove colors and colorize new dates
[08:35:42] <hellyeah> i will see about that
[08:36:37] <hellyeah> shoky_: i will plan to disable pervious input box when you create new one
[08:36:43] <hellyeah> and plan to go update button
[08:37:08] <hellyeah> update button will enable input boxes and remove color from calendar
[08:37:17] <hellyeah> dont know 100% how to do
[08:37:35] <shoky_> good luck ;p
[09:16:20] <RabSimpson> hi folks. after not having looked at ajax in a long time, i'm trying to work with it. now, success: function(data) obviously returns the entire page requested, but i'd like to get the .html from a single element on the returned page. could someone point me in the right direction?
[09:18:49] <decx> stop using success, put a jquery wrapper around your data, traverse as per usual
[09:27:05] <RabSimpson> decx: sorry, got disconnected
[09:27:13] <RabSimpson> decx: i'm not sure what you mean
[09:27:28] <Bloomer> how to send raw data to backend via ajax? this is my code => https://gist.github.com/alatebloomer/ae51c84c0123ab6b2834
[09:27:30] <decx> observe https://jsfiddle.net/decx/w3mcyacj/
[09:28:07] <RabSimpson> decx: danke :)
[09:29:13] <RabSimpson> decx: ahhh, i see :)
[09:30:26] <shoky_> Bloomer: that's how you do it. except for that "failure" option which doesn't exist :P  but since you're doing a cross-domain request, the server must explicitly be configured to respond with the proper CORS headers
[09:30:55] <shoky_> Bloomer: that is, you can't do cross-domain ajax without the server enabling it
[09:32:03] <Bloomer> shoky_: the server already enable the cross-domain, because i call other api which dont need send with data  and that works
[09:32:29] <Bloomer> shoky_: i hava no idea why call api with data will have that error message
[09:32:50] <shoky_> Bloomer: the server is replying with 405 for the OPTIONS request that is part of the CORS check when doing cross-domain POST
[09:33:12] <Bloomer> shoky_: hmm....
[09:33:30] <Bloomer> shoky_: so server need to confige for OPTIONS? right?
[09:34:25] <shoky_> Bloomer: yes, if it wants to allow these types of requests (a POST request with a content-type of json)
[09:34:45] <shoky_> Bloomer: see  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests
[09:35:02] <Bloomer> shoky_: thanks for reply, i will talk to backend guy. i really appreciate.
[09:35:08] <shoky_> Bloomer: "In particular, a request is preflighted if:  ...  if POST is used to send request data with a Content-Type other than application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain
[09:35:10] <shoky_> "
[09:53:17] <hellyeah> yo
[10:03:56] <vancrash> Hello, is there line I could run in the console to quickly see if a site is using jquery or jquery mobile?
[10:07:20] <hellyeah> yo
[10:07:45] <vancrash> hmmm, it seems I may have misunderstood the difference between jquery and jquery mobile
[10:08:23] <vancrash> is there a list someone outlining which mobile devices jquery (not mobile) is known to work on?
[10:10:58] <andrei___> Hi
[10:11:47] <andrei___> I've got a question about jQuery UI sortables and draggables connected to each other.
[10:18:26] <shoky_> vancrash: https://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:21:55] <vancrash> shoky_, Thanks, yes I saw that. it certainly does cover the main browsers, but I was hoping for a more complete list akin to this but for regular jquery https://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/1.4/
[10:24:19] <shoky_> that refers to things in jquery mobile that have nothing to do with jquery. but uh you can assume jquery works fine on anything in this list, i'm sure
[10:27:57] <Bloomer> shoky_ : i just add OPTIONS to allow methods but still got 405 method not allowed? this is updated gist https://gist.github.com/alatebloomer/ae51c84c0123ab6b2834
[10:32:25] <shoky_> Bloomer: seems the response code is still 405 though?
[10:32:35] <shoky_> Bloomer: so server is still not responding properly
[10:33:17] <djoanes> Hey, on hover on some random page , it spawns a tooltip, but it's behind stuff. If i want to change the z-index of it and i know the classes it belongs to... how would i do it
[10:35:21] <Bloomer> shoky_: ok, i will check , thanks
[10:36:07] <djoanes> $("#class").cass("z-index", 999999) doesn't work
[10:36:14] <djoanes> s/cass/css/
[10:36:14] <b-ot> Correction, <djoanes> $("#class").css("z-index", 999999) doesn't work
[10:36:24] <djoanes> Nice
[10:37:00] <decx> read up on the intricacies of z-index and its relation to the position property
[10:37:08] <decx> then skip the whole javascript to do css thing
[10:41:11] <hlvwrk> uhhhhhhhhhhh
[10:41:21] <hlvwrk> why are you using a hashtag for a class?
[10:41:27] <hlvwrk> just curious
[10:47:48] <tobe_b> hi all, could anyone help me out with an solution, trying to replace all found matches with an link see here -> https://jsfiddle.net/8qj7rxk7/1/
[10:51:36] <shoky_> tobe_b: https://jsfiddle.net/8qj7rxk7/2/
[10:52:24] <shoky_> you had invalid html
[10:54:06] <djoanes> hlvwrk: # == class....

[10:55:14] <tobe_b> shoky_: wow that was quick, thx
[10:56:10] <tobe_b>  i will look into it
[11:12:20] <tobe_b> shoky_: https://jsfiddle.net/8qj7rxk7/3/ that's not exactly what i need, cause it would replace any td but i want only the specific one's which contains #numbers# thats why i loop them in the first place here  https://jsfiddle.net/8qj7rxk7/1/
[11:20:26] <shoky_> tobe_b: you can use .filter() to filter them  https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8qj7rxk7/4/
[11:24:36] <hlvwrk> lol "# IS A CLASS".
[11:29:05] <tobe_b> shoky_: thx that worked for me
[11:30:04] <tobe_b> i do not know what .test() is
[11:31:40] <shoky_> tobe_b:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[11:31:48] <hlvwrk> tobe_b, isn't the same thing as .isFunction?

[11:48:37] <robertmaxrees> Sagar okay.  where are you getting stuck?
[11:49:30] <robertmaxrees> you realize that your regex is your issue, yeah?  because you're testing if it's only alphanumeric, but you want it to start with a #
[11:50:05] <robertmaxrees> basically, your whole first branch is off.
[11:50:45] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: yes
[11:51:01] <Sagar> i want to first validate, it should begin with #, then validate, it only has letters, digits, # and - in it
[11:51:05] <Sagar> is the regex wrong?
[11:51:13] <robertmaxrees> your logic is all wrong :)
[11:51:36] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "if I have a value, and it starts with #, and the entire string is alphanumeric, it's bad"
[11:51:58] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[11:52:06] <robertmaxrees> you can't start with # AND be only alphanumeric.
[11:52:28] <Sagar> I am new to regex, can u help me?
[11:52:52] <robertmaxrees> the mdn docs are simple, but you could literally just do if (!(ref) || !alnum.test(ref)) { and change it to var alnum = /^#[a-zA-Z0-9#-]*$/;
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> also: don't invert your conditionals like that.  keep it simple: https://jsfiddle.net/5nj28o33/4/
[11:57:31] <Sagar> rovermaxress: it still validates if no # is at beginning
[11:58:51] <Sagar> i better use chatAt
[11:59:17] <decx> landrover?
[12:12:04] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> Sagar the docs on MDN should be helpful for you, but you should get the general idea.
[12:13:00] <Sagar> i am trying with charAt
[12:13:39] <Sagar> Thanks :)
[12:13:52] <tobe_b> decx: $('td:not(:has(a))') does the trick
[12:15:05] <decx> that's a double filter
[12:15:41] <tobe_b> haven't found another way, till now :-)
[12:15:59] <decx> :not is a shorthand for a filter, going through all your td, then another filter, going through all your td, when you could've just done return !$(this).has('a') && /#.*#/....
[12:18:23] <claytonzaugg> has anyone else had an issue with Chrome in dev mode, when you resize, the resolution you're resizing to no longer appears?
[12:18:38] <claytonzaugg> I'm running Chrome version 49
[12:26:44] <shoky_> tobe_b: another way  https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8qj7rxk7/6/
[12:29:13] <decx> how can a ^ do that much difference
[12:29:22] <decx> oh right html() instead of text() derp
[12:31:40] <shoky_> but the $ and ^ are necessary too
[12:31:45] <shoky_> well at least one of them
[12:31:54] <shoky_> because regex ;p
[12:32:26] <tobe_b> works like charm thx
[12:35:13] <arc_> i need to make a bookmarklet that adds jquery to whatever page i'm on
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> aren't there browser extensions that do that?
[12:35:52] <arc_> probably, but if a bookmarklet can do it, seems more lightweight
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> what version do you need?
[12:36:19] <arc_> idk, i would just use the latest version
[12:36:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to add some handling to make sure you don't stomp over whatever is already there.
[12:36:23] <shoky_> i'm sure tehre are tons of bookmarklets that do just that. try google?
[12:36:39] <arc_> sorry shoky_ i'm not asking for help, just thinking out loud ;)
[12:37:04] <shoky_> better if you say that up front :)
[12:37:52] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:37:53] <shoky_> better if you don't do it, really :)
[12:37:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:38:53] <arc_> i think the channel will probably be okay
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> just kind of a waste of our time if you don't lead off with that.
[12:40:09] <shoky_> the channel will be okay even if you swear and spam nonstop
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[12:41:37] <decx> i can swear?
[12:41:46] <decx> i thought there was a code of conduct thingy
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> there is.
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> swearing is ok just so long as you don't do it like all the time.  it's more about not being exclusionary/etc to others.
[12:43:24] <shoky_> my point was meant to be that just because you can do it doesn't mean you should :) in case that wasn't clear
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:54:44] <chris___> Hi, I have a Qunit test failure with .slideToggle() method. https://jsfiddle.net/chrismcginlay/tjLeqj01/1/
[12:54:48] <m2n> Can anybody please help me with jqeury.append().. I am trying to append a string to an div element with id tag. jquery code : http://pastebin.com/nbcUrqVm on this view : http://pastebin.com/sN0GyckT
[12:55:47] <Cork> m2n: don't append in a loop
[12:56:00] <Cork> it is very slow and will completely wreck the performance
[12:56:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^'
[12:56:13] <Cork> (cause the browser is forced to do a ton of extra work)
[12:56:35] <Cork> instead either generate dom elements directly, or parse the tr into elements
[12:56:43] <Cork> and then append an array of those elements in one go
[12:56:51] <Cork> that will be MUCH better for performance
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> or create a single object and then append that after you generate it.
[12:56:59] <Cork> ya
[12:57:55] <chris___> When .slideToggle is called on an element, the display style remains set to 'block' in the test "shade, not visible"
[12:58:08] <Cork> m2n: also you didn't explain what you needed help with
[12:58:44] <m2n> Cork, ok thanks for the advice. actually .append() actually not appending anything within the dic id
[12:58:54] <m2n> *div
[12:59:29] <Cork> m2n: what does console.log($('[id="requests-list"]').length) give you?
[12:59:49] <decx> '[id=""]' really?
[13:00:00] <Cork> decx: to see duplicate entries
[13:00:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:00:06] <Cork> but i found the problem
[13:00:11] <Cork> $('#requests-list').remove(); <--
[13:00:14] <Cork> you remove the element
[13:00:18] <decx> hehe
[13:00:20] <Cork> so you can't append to it as it is gone
[13:00:25] <m2n> Yes I remove the previous element first
[13:00:29] <Cork> you prob want $('#requests-list').empty();
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> chris___ because display isn't none.  it's block./
[13:00:33] <m2n> oohh..
[13:03:40] <m2n> ` $('#requests-list').empty();` this still doesn't solve my problem. btw  console.log($('[id="requests-list"]').length) gives me 1
[13:04:14] <shoky_> chris___: you're not using qunit properly, need to use .async() . also it's 3000 not "3000"
[13:04:29] <shoky_> chris___: https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bdncL0e7/1/
[13:14:58] <m2n> Cork, I tried to do it with dom element instead of inserting with loop, but it's still not updating the `#requests-list` ? btw here is the new jquery codes : http://pastebin.com/rczj4V8R , view is same btw : http://pastebin.com/sN0GyckT
[13:21:51] <Cork> m2n: $elementsToAppend.push($appendElement[0])
[13:22:06] <Cork> and $("#requests-list").append($elementsToAppend)
[13:22:10] <chris___> Thank you @shoky_
[13:22:18] <Cork> is an array so it doesn't have appendTo
[13:32:48] <chris___> Thanks also robertmaxrees , but as I understand it display:none should be set after .slideToggle. shoky_ 's fiddle works with that!
[13:33:13] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't in your case for whatever reason :) glad you figured it out.
[13:33:41] <chris___> yeah! so am I. Should have asked here several hours ago.
[13:33:44] <shoky_> it wasn't because qunit resets the elements after each test, and the missing async thing had it end early or whatever
[13:34:14] * chris___ very grateful
[13:34:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[13:43:33] <otahak> hey guys. https://jsfiddle.net/khz9u0hh/ - I need help selecting the parent element once Im well in a loop or two. see lines 13/17?
[13:43:36] <otahak> Im trying to select .item > .title .attr('title')
[13:43:49] <otahak> what's the syntax / selector for that?
[13:44:08] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do here?
[13:44:30] <otahak> tool tip, essentially
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> why do you have a for loop?
[13:44:50] <otahak> to prevent multiple instances
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> why not just see how many you have instead?
[13:46:02] <otahak> not sure what youre asking
[13:46:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost here haha
[13:46:17] <otahak> haha
[13:46:24] <otahak> my bad. allow me to clarify whats happening
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to add a tooltip to whatever image your mnouse is over.
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:46:43] <otahak> yarp
[13:47:09] <otahak> the problem I was having was selection ultimately
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> why not just hide/show the tooltips instead of creating/destroying them?
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> trying to help you simplify this.
[13:47:32] <otahak> a more simple - loopless version worked but if a person moused over a couple and then held on one - they'd both/all disappear
[13:47:44] <otahak> hmmm. didnt think of that.
[13:47:47] <otahak> far more simple lol
[13:47:56] <robertmaxrees> also .find() takes the same kinds of selectors that $() takes.
[13:48:03] <robertmaxrees> .find('title') looks for a <title> element.
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> which doersn't exist.
[13:48:15] <otahak> no no, not 'title'
[13:48:17] <otahak> '.title'
[13:48:26] <robertmaxrees> see the issue then? :)
[13:48:30] <otahak> OH!
[13:48:31] <otahak> derp
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> and no need for the for loop there.
[13:48:41] <otahak> herpa'f'ing-derp lol
[13:49:05] <otahak> why not?
[13:49:17] <otahak> Im just concerned about removing the instances of .tool_tip that arent hovered over
[13:49:36] <otahak> so I figured by counting em I could select em specifically through each iteration
[13:49:49] <otahak> a bit complicated, sure - but works like a charm every time
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> don't select things like that.  use your document's hierarchy for that.
[13:50:01] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it's also terribly confusing :)
[13:50:17] <otahak> haha. sorry. my design abilities are fledgling
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> not a design issue.  it's a code issue.
[13:50:33] <otahak> I actually picked up a book on design concepts... it's made a great dust collector
[13:50:41] <otahak> (coding design)
[13:50:43] <decx> it's case by base if a tooltip that you destroy before creating a new one is the right choice
[13:50:56] <otahak> well, I started off simple, I assure you
[13:51:09] <otahak> but I was having 2 main issues
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> also: why not using any one of the dozens of good tooltip libraries in existence?
[13:51:18] <otahak> 1)  stacking of instances
[13:51:46] <otahak> 2) both instances would be cleared upon the non-hovered one going away
[13:52:00] <otahak> also, I looked at those
[13:52:05] <otahak> but mostly I wanted the challenge
[13:52:07] <decx> i did it once with 1 instance of a tooltip and then detaching it, changing its attributes and then reappending where i needed it
[13:52:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that means you needed to change your dom traversal.  that's all.
[13:52:13] <otahak> jqueryUI had a simple solution to this
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> otahak there's also powertip and many others.
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> but alright :)
[13:52:41] <otahak> but yes, I was aware of the alternative to my contrived coding xD
[13:54:32] <otahak> hmmm
[13:54:39] <otahak> while that was an error
[13:54:43] <otahak> it didnt work
[13:54:49] <otahak> tooltip still comes up undefined
[13:54:59] <robertmaxrees> the .find() bit?
[13:55:01] <otahak> yarp
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> because there's to title attribute on that element.
[13:55:10] <otahak> should I find('p > title') ?
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> the title is on the anchor.
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> not the p.
[13:55:33] <otahak> oh nooo
[13:55:34] <otahak> yeah
[13:55:43] <otahak> it'd be children('a') right?
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> or .find().
[13:56:16] <otahak> brb
[13:56:17] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of leaving it up to chance that the first one will have the right title.
[13:56:23] <otahak> last minute meeting lol
[13:56:28] <robertmaxrees> i might use .find() and .filter() to get what you want.
[13:56:29] <otahak> well, specifically
[13:56:38] <otahak> I wanna select the title relative to that instance
[13:56:58] <otahak> so if it shows up on the first one, I want it to find the P > A > title of that instance
[13:57:01] <otahak> brb tho
[14:12:13] <otahak> back
[14:18:48] <buddyq> hi guys, I have a nivoslider that is not working on the page but there are no errors in console. I have the jquery in the page but it doesn’t do anything until I copy and paste that jquery code in console. Then it shows up. So I know the jquery is correct. So why doesn’t it work in the page? It’s wrapped inside of a jQuery(document).ready()..
[14:19:21] <otahak> buddyq - plz jsfiddle your example
[14:19:40] <buddyq> oh boy… i was hoping you wouldn’t ask me that. Not sure if I can do that.
[14:19:46] <otahak> ah
[14:20:32] <otahak> well, off the cuff - no reflection on you but plz answer the following: are you sure you included the proper libs? are you positive you have the <div id="slider"> in the right place?
[14:20:40] <otahak> I recall with nivo is finnicky about placement
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> buddyq any console errors?
[14:21:24] <buddyq> otahak: yes, it worked a few days ago. I’ve been making small edits around the site, mostly css on other pages etc. However, it works if I paste the jquery in console.
[14:21:29] <buddyq> robertmaxrees: no errors.
[14:21:33] <buddyq> no 404's
[14:21:49] <otahak> buddyq - could you possibly backtrace your progress til it works again?
[14:22:11] <buddyq> otahak: I dont think thats possible. I’ve made over a hundred changes to multiple files.
[14:22:16] <otahak> ahhh
[14:22:28] <otahak> well, how about you set up a demo - just the bare bones?
[14:22:39] <otahak> sometimes I find making an example helps me figure out where I went wrong in my customizations
[14:25:12] <otahak> kind of a silly question to the more experienced but - does dom perspective change from within my loop?
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> "dom perspective"?
[14:25:37] <buddyq> yes. Hmm…i will try.
[14:25:44] <otahak> hard to explain as Im not sure of the terminology but
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> otahak you mean your $(this)?
[14:26:00] <otahak> in part, yes
[14:26:08] <otahak> does $(this) change meaning deeper into the loop you go?
[14:26:27] <otahak> or does $(this) always refer to the parent that invoked the function() ?
[14:26:39] <otahak> (sorry for butchering terminology)
[14:26:43] <robertmaxrees> loops don't change context.
[14:26:47] <robertmaxrees> nor do they have scope.
[14:26:51] <robertmaxrees> only functions change scope.
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> and context.
[14:27:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is just the context passed through the jquery object.
[14:27:15] <otahak> ah
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> *constructor.,
[14:27:23] <robertmaxrees> so really ou care about `this`
[14:27:32] <otahak> yes, it would seem so
[14:27:47] <otahak> thats what I thought, but my difficulty with this threw me off
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery pretty consistently passes the DOM collection you're working off of as the context for your callbacks.
[14:28:42] <otahak> another question. when selecting children - in my specific example - could I select the <a> inside .title without going through p first?
[14:28:53] <robertmaxrees> it really depends.
[14:28:58] <otahak> or would it have to be something like .title > p > a
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> your markup really isn't optimal to begin with.
[14:29:41] <otahak> cos of the loop?
[14:29:47] <robertmaxrees> because of your markup.
[14:29:50] <otahak> lol
[14:29:50] <robertmaxrees> html, not js.
[14:30:06] <otahak> what would you change?
[14:30:21] <buddyq> okay well I put the code in further down the page and the dots show up for the navigation but not the pictures and the pictures are there in the page just hidden.
[14:30:24] <robertmaxrees> fiddle again?
[14:30:48] <otahak> haha just a sec
[14:31:35] <otahak> https://jsfiddle.net/jksgk00r/
[14:31:47] <z1haze2> what is the easiest way to show/hide a menu when hovering over an element, and still having it shown while you are over the ul
[14:31:49] <otahak> buddyq - try making a blank html with just nivo to sort out how to fit it
[14:31:58] <buddyq> ok
[14:31:59] <otahak> zlhaze2 - css :hover
[14:32:18] <otahak> buddyq - do you still have the examples included with nivo? those can be a great help
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> otahak why not just use a single anchor around all your item contents?
[14:32:37] <buddyq> otahak: no
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want everything linked anyway.
[14:33:02] <otahak> arent anchors limited in their placement rules?
[14:33:19] <otahak> specifically I was worried an a wouldnt display: inline-block as needed
[14:33:34] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a - look at the "permitted content"
[14:33:44] <robertmaxrees> you can change the CSS as needed.
[14:33:44] <otahak> zlhaze2 http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> w3schools ;(
[14:34:01] <otahak> well, to hell with the a wrapped in p
[14:34:05] <otahak> (first result lol)
[14:34:15] <robertmaxrees> w3fools.com
[14:34:23] <robertmaxrees> lots of better resources out there.
[14:34:35] <otahak> yeah
[14:34:45] <otahak> but esp. for simple stuff like hover over css - shouldn't be too far off the mark lol
[14:34:45] <z1haze2> k well i have this little fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/52aw4w2L/3/ which is basically what im doing, but for some reason my actual page doesnt work.. looking at the inspector during hover, it seems to change the css really fast when i hover, but then changes it back again
[14:34:46] <decx> make your own search, with black jack and hookers
[14:35:11] <otahak> ^
[14:35:21] <decx> like i have: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/search?q=%s
[14:35:27] <decx> with the keyword mdn
[14:35:36] <decx> so i can just enter mdn term into my addressbar
[14:35:50] <robertmaxrees> i just use google - mdn <term here>
[14:35:58] <otahak> zlhaze2 - have your menu items start off display: none; and change it on :hover
[14:36:16] <otahak> perhaps that'll help.. but otherwise it looks legit
[14:36:24] <decx> they keyword bookmarks are the best thing in firefox
[14:36:31] <otahak> maybe examine if production site has rules overwriting your menu rules?
[14:36:34] <decx> does chrome have something like it
[14:36:36] <robertmaxrees> decx truth
[14:38:57] <otahak> buddyq - https://github.com/gilbitron/Nivo-Slider/blob/master/demo/demo.html - an example of the core nivo slider (for your reference)
[14:39:13] <buddyq> thanks
[14:39:15] <otahak> try to make an example as close to what they did there
[14:39:23] <otahak> without seeing your actual code, thats the best advice I can give. sorry m8
[14:42:33] <buddyq> fixed it. If I moved the code to the page that was requesting it, it would work.
[14:42:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> where was the code before?
[14:43:19] <otahak> haha
[14:43:30] <otahak> well, congrats buddyq - glad you sorted it out
[14:43:41] <buddyq> index is master template page. It includes a js file. It works if I put it in the js file or the index
[14:43:57] <otahak> wut.jpg
[14:43:59] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe things are getting loaded out of order.
[14:44:12] <buddyq> however, this is a module in Joomla and I was trying to contain it within its own module where the module adds js scripts etc. That is where it wont work.
[14:44:39] <otahak> ahh, no.. dont think you can do that.
[14:44:46] <otahak> each instance has to be unique to itsself
[14:45:01] <ata> hello, could please someone help with some examples with this? http://pastebin.com/ynBwd9TZ   thank you
[14:45:04] <otahak> and if I recall, you have to launch seperate instances on the same page seperately
[14:45:12] <otahak> ata- whats your beef?
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> ata we don't make examples :)
[14:45:19] <claytonzaugg> Is my understanding of wrapAll correct, based on my code example? https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/fa87a095ff2c2e6b1f1e
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> ata we help you figure it out instead.
[14:45:29] <ata> not exactly example, just suggest what to do
[14:45:37] <ata> thats what i ment so say, sorry:)
[14:45:45] <deadevilboy> hi guys
[14:45:46] <otahak> lol
[14:45:57] <otahak> ata - short answer to your question is - "code it"
[14:45:57] <robertmaxrees> ata what is your question then?
[14:46:05] <claytonzaugg> Because my code follows this pricinple, but it's not working
[14:46:11] <decx> claytonzaugg: you want innerWrap on #foo instead
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg make a fiddle?
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> hah, or decx+++
[14:46:47] <deadevilboy> can u explain me one thing... I am dinamically adding some inputs... and I want to check with each function how many classes did I add... however, the code always shows the same twice, why?
[14:47:01] <claytonzaugg> Thanks decx, let me try it real quick robertmaxrees and then I'll jsfiddle if it's not working.
[14:47:02] <ata> well, i'm not that experienced in jq as you are) i just want you to help me find the way to do that
[14:47:25] <otahak> I understand ata, but you've presented essentially a request for someone to do the coding for you
[14:47:27] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy you mean it's not working for the things you're adding?
[14:47:32] <otahak> if you want to hire someone, Im sure someone might be interested
[14:47:43] <robertmaxrees> otahak actually, not the right place for hiring :)
[14:47:46] <otahak> but typically folks bring actual coding-examples theyre experiencing difficulty with here in order to explore solutions
[14:47:52] <otahak> ah. I stand corrected :D
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> ata are you stuck with where to start?
[14:48:10] <ata> im not looking to hire anyone. can you just tell me whats the best way to make that form appear smoothly as it is in example?
[14:48:28] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: it works... but imagine this scenario, u click and add button and add a car with some license plate.. that license plate will be stored in a hidden input with "abc" classname for example
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> ata using css animations.
[14:48:53] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy i hate "imagining" things.
[14:48:57] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle instead?
[14:49:01] <deadevilboy> the to know how many license plates the user adds I can check how many inputs do I have with that classname
[14:49:15] <otahak> jsfiddle or gfto lol
[14:49:15] <deadevilboy> lol
[14:49:42] <deadevilboy> it's the same as using for
[14:49:50] <deadevilboy> it will double the alert ou the console.log
[14:49:53] <ata> thats right! css animations! thanks
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> for loops are bad DEADB33F
[14:50:02] <robertmaxrees> and that isn't helpful.
[14:50:14] <deadevilboy> just a sec
[14:50:16] <deadevilboy> grrrrrr!
[14:50:26] <robertmaxrees> err, deadevilboy
[14:50:28] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[14:50:37] <deadevilboy> hehehe np
[14:50:58] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/gz9o27eq/
[14:51:10] <claytonzaugg> decx, https://jsfiddle.net/gz9o27eq/
[14:51:39] <decx> you could've at least glanced at what you copied there
[14:52:06] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg you're missing a lot in there ;)
[14:52:34] <claytonzaugg> Oh freak, sorry jquery!
[14:56:14] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, did you make the /1 edit?
[14:56:32] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember.
[14:56:33] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[14:56:44] <claytonzaugg> https://jsfiddle.net/gz9o27eq/1/
[14:56:46] <robertmaxrees> your code was way malformed though.
[14:56:50] <robertmaxrees> i still don'
[14:56:55] <robertmaxrees> *don't remember, but that's what you want.
[14:57:20] <robertmaxrees> also, if you inspect the HTML, you can see what it's doing.
[14:57:31] <z1haze2> what isthe difference in doing el.find()... and $(el).find() ?
[14:57:42] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 is el already a jquery object?
[14:57:48] <z1haze2> yes
[14:58:00] <z1haze2> var el = $(this)
[14:58:09] <robertmaxrees> then all $(el) is doing is passing back through the jquery constructor, which you want to avoid.
[14:58:24] <z1haze2> alright
[14:58:52] <teaearlgraycold> So when I do $(selector).focus(); I see that the focus() event fires, but then subsequently doing $(selector).is(':focus') returns false. $(selector).focusout(...) never fires however.
[14:59:56] <robertmaxrees> all you're really doing with .focus is triggering the handlers iirc.
[15:00:10] <teaearlgraycold> How do I "select" an element?
[15:00:15] <claytonzaugg> oh jeez, yeah I see where I missed things on my example.  Sorry, and thanks robertmaxrees
[15:00:16] <teaearlgraycold> Like as if I were to click it
[15:00:17] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[15:00:20] <teaearlgraycold> I mean, select an input
[15:00:30] <teaearlgraycold> I want the text cursor in a certain input field
[15:03:30] <robertmaxrees> iirc there's an autofocus attribute for newer browsers.
[15:03:35] <robertmaxrees> otherwise .focus() should work just fine./
[15:05:27] <teaearlgraycold> sadly autofocus can't work for me - it needs to happen after an event fires
[15:05:41] <robertmaxrees> then .focus() *should* be fine.
[15:05:57] <decx> more details plz
[15:06:17] <teaearlgraycold> It's weird - I set $(selector).focus(function() { console.log('foo') }); and that fires when I do .focus();
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:06:35] <robertmaxrees> because .focus() triggers the handlers bound to that event.
[15:06:48] <teaearlgraycold> Can I get a list of functions bound to focus?
[15:06:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:06:56] <decx> when are you actually trying to focus
[15:07:01] <decx> from another input
[15:07:04] <decx> or a link or what
[15:07:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run other handlers bound ot that element, too?
[15:07:28] <teaearlgraycold> When a modal opens.
[15:07:30] <teaearlgraycold> No
[15:07:33] <decx> like you have a list of radio buttons and when i choose one it should focus the next input
[15:07:36] <teaearlgraycold> Just curious if something is blocking it
[15:07:39] <decx> aha! in a modal
[15:07:58] <teaearlgraycold> But once it's already open and I go to the console it still will not work
[15:08:11] <decx> what modal
[15:08:18] <teaearlgraycold> Bootstrap modal
[15:08:34] <decx> is that even on jsfiddle
[15:08:43] <decx> there are several cdn, make a fiddle
[15:09:02] <teaearlgraycold> Okay, that'll take a bit
[15:09:04] <decx> a form in a modal, shouldnt be too hard as a simple test case
[15:09:10] <decx> let's race then
[15:11:14] <teaearlgraycold> Well it works in jsfiddle
[15:11:20] <teaearlgraycold> It might be twitter typeahead screwing with it
[15:11:33] <claytonzaugg> How can I select the last .classNameDuplicated on the dom?  nth-child(last)?
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> .last() is a method iirc.
[15:12:18] <teaearlgraycold> It is
[15:12:23] <claytonzaugg> Thanks robertmaxrees, I'll check syntax on api.jquery for use
[15:12:37] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').last()
[15:12:50] <teaearlgraycold> decx:
[15:12:50] <claytonzaugg> Cool, thank you!
[15:12:51] <decx> oh i see, the first thing the modal docs from bootstrap mention is the focus() on shown.bs.modal ^^
[15:13:48] <teaearlgraycold> Actually that's not it. Hmm....
[15:14:01] <teaearlgraycold> Well it's clearly something on my end
[15:14:36] <decx> console.log() all the stuff to see what your shown.bs.modal event function sees
[15:15:10] <teaearlgraycold> It's not an issue with that event
[15:15:30] <teaearlgraycold> It won't work regardless of when I call .focus()
[15:16:01] <teaearlgraycold> Hrrmm... seems like focus() doesn't work at all on my site
[15:16:03] <teaearlgraycold> gg
[15:16:12] <otahak> lol
[15:16:14] <decx> not bad
[15:16:32] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/endcaokt/1/
[15:16:36] <deadevilboy> this one is working ok
[15:16:45] <deadevilboy> but in my code it is not working.. I don't know why
[15:17:01] <deadevilboy> this one only shows one alert after the first add..
[15:17:04] <robertmaxrees> cars_nr++; just use .length
[15:17:24] <deadevilboy> but in mine code is displaying 2 alerts with the same index
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> alerts are bad for debugging.
[15:17:59] <robertmaxrees> try using console logs.
[15:18:02] <deadevilboy> I did
[15:18:09] <deadevilboy> 2 + 2 +2 +2 everytime I add
[15:18:16] <deadevilboy> always duplicating
[15:18:25] <robertmaxrees> so you can't replicate the bug on a fiddle?
[15:18:33] <deadevilboy> it's a lot of code
[15:18:47] <deadevilboy> but it is basically the same as that example
[15:18:52] <robertmaxrees> "basically the same" lol
[15:19:02] <deadevilboy> it is not of course
[15:19:08] <deadevilboy> but I can't replicate it there
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> what's up with the IDs?
[15:19:38] <deadevilboy> I can post it.. just the important piece..
[15:19:43] <claytonzaugg> How would I find the .last() class of duplicates, then manipulate the code within that class element?
[15:19:56] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg huh?
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> .last() will get you the last element in a collection
[15:20:14] <robertmaxrees> you work with it like you would any other jquery object.
[15:20:27] <claytonzaugg> Let me jsfiddle something for you robertmaxrees
[15:20:33] <deadevilboy> robert when u say .length u mean that I should check the length of the cars_nr?
[15:21:02] <deadevilboy> or the input class length?
[15:21:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/endcaokt/2/
[15:23:38] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxtress, how would I make just the last grouping of #foo elements contain the .bar class? https://jsfiddle.net/gz9o27eq/5/
[15:23:49] <robertmaxrees> you can't replicate IDs on a page.
[15:23:53] <robertmaxrees> that's your first problem.
[15:24:27] <otahak> instead of #foo, .foo
[15:24:29] <otahak> foo.
[15:24:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz9o27eq/6/
[15:24:38] <robertmaxrees> so you want to wrapall only on the last group?
[15:24:53] <claytonzaugg> correct
[15:25:03] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo').last().find() is probably what you want.
[15:25:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz9o27eq/7/
[15:26:23] <claytonzaugg> Okay cool, just daisy chain that... okay cool, thank you robertmaxrees!
[15:31:21] <decx> are there more things in the last foo that you don't want to wrap?
[15:31:27] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, that syntax fixed my problem.  Thank you very much, again, for helping me understand jquery further :)
[15:31:34] <decx> otherwise you can do .last().wrapInner('<div class="bar">')
[15:33:53] <claytonzaugg> so decx, what's the difference between the two then?
[15:34:47] <decx> one looks for everything that matches in your selector argument, the other just wraps  all of it
[15:35:25] <decx> like if you had 5 items in the last foo but only wanted to wrap these specific ones you could group them
[15:35:40] <decx> of course if you would do something so elaborate then you want to do sorting a whole other way
[15:38:40] <MrGate> Hey
[15:39:35] <MrGate> how could i make this go back to the first element when it hits the last element
[15:39:35] <MrGate> http://pastebin.com/HxKxba8i
[15:39:51] <MrGate> im stuck on how to approach that part of the script at the moment
[15:41:47] <decx> you have several options
[15:42:20] <decx> css animations
[15:42:47] <decx> or a setTimeouat
[15:42:50] <decx> out
[15:43:05] <decx> delay is weird
[15:43:20] <decx> the set
[15:43:22] <acidjazz> if i do an ajax .get and grab a bunch of html, whats the best way to jquery-ize it and grab a section of it?
[15:43:26] <decx> Timeout would just use css also
[15:43:42] <decx> without the need for a preprocessor if you have a variable number of ticker items
[15:44:00] <hlvwrk> I'll set your timeout
[15:44:01] <hlvwrk> ;)
[15:44:35] <decx> acidjazz: you can just wrap the data you get back and traverse that
[15:45:15] <shoky_> MrGate: this would work..   var nextElem = elem.next(); if (!nextElem.length) { nextElem = elem.siblings().first() }
[15:45:16] <acidjazz> how though
[15:45:25] <acidjazz> decx: wrap the html in $() ?
[15:45:34] <acidjazz> decx: $(html).find('.certain.class'); ?
[15:45:36] <shoky_> MrGate: also pass numbers to .delay and .fadeIn not strings
[15:45:42] <acidjazz> decx: tried htat didnt owrk
[15:46:07] <decx> acidjazz: is it a flat dom?
[15:46:13] <decx> like just a few items
[15:46:20] <decx> the data you get back
[15:46:31] <acidjazz> decx: i think i need filter
[15:46:39] <decx> that's what i'm going for here yes
[15:46:52] <z1haze2> how do I use a variable in the success function of an ajax request
[15:46:58] <acidjazz> bingo perfect
[15:46:59] <acidjazz> thanks
[15:47:05] <shoky_> z1haze2 same as you use variables anywhere else
[15:47:07] <acidjazz> decx: you think this is the most efficient way?
[15:47:17] <z1haze2> its in scope if I declared it before the callback?
[15:47:19] <decx> yes filter is right for this
[15:48:22] <MrGate> thanks shoky_ ill let you know if it works
[15:48:26] <shoky_> z1haze2: yes
[15:48:40] <shoky_> z1haze2 assuming it's in an outer enclosing scope
[15:53:35] <MrGate> shoky_: http://pastebin.com/ZUYr74v3   -  am i not doing it right ?
[15:54:09] <shoky_> MrGate: umm you're not doing anything with nextElem ?
[15:54:28] <MrGate> im kinda new to jquery, can you help me out and explain shoky_
[15:54:39] <shoky_> MrGate: which part?
[15:54:46] <MrGate> where im not using it ?
[15:54:53] <shoky_> MrGate: you're not using it anywhere :)
[15:54:58] <MrGate> i thought if i put it in the fadeout function it would work ?
[15:55:09] <shoky_> you didn't put it in the fadeout function
[15:55:19] <MrGate> ops, where should i put it ?
[15:55:23] <MrGate> sorry :(
[15:56:03] <shoky_> InOut( elem.next() );    that part calls InOut  passing it elem.next() but you said you have a problem when there is no next element
[15:56:36] <shoky_> so i showed you how you can get the next element, and if it doesnt exist, get the first one again. and i put this in `nextElem`
[15:56:47] <MrGate> ok
[15:56:50] <MrGate> im trying
[15:56:56] <shoky_> but if you keep calling it passing elem.next()  then that won't be using the `nextElem` that we made
[15:58:04] <MrGate> i got it working shoky_ :)
[15:58:12] <MrGate> this is the correct way yes??? http://pastebin.com/9x6tfKWf
[15:58:37] <shoky_> that's ok. though you don't need lines 21-22
[15:58:48] <shoky_> also donno why you're calling .delay() on line 10
[15:59:01] <shoky_> and, you're still passing strings instead of numbers
[15:59:06] <MrGate> typo :)
[15:59:10] <MrGate> ill fix 1 sec
[15:59:44] <MrGate> http://pastebin.com/KJkN8ZTS
[15:59:45] <MrGate> :)
[15:59:47] <MrGate> thanks man
[16:00:02] <shoky_> np
[16:02:46] <acidjazz> decx: strangest shit ever for some reason .filter just stopped working
[16:07:39] <decx> well did you add more stuff to your return data acidjazz?
[16:07:58] <acidjazz> its a striaght up html page
[16:08:02] <acidjazz> im doing a get on a page
[16:08:07] <acidjazz> and trying to extract a certain element from it
[16:08:15] <acidjazz> no i havent added anything
[16:08:22] <acidjazz> so strange
[16:08:42] <decx> probably something stupid
[16:08:49] <acidjazz> but its like the entire html page
[16:08:51] <acidjazz> doctype and all
[16:08:52] <acidjazz> thats ok right
[16:08:55] <acidjazz> sigh it was just workign wtf
[16:10:21] <acidjazz> decx: anythign i can test beore the filter
[16:10:49] <decx> console.log your data, try find again, bash head
[16:10:52] <acidjazz> decx: if i do $(result).length i get 91 so thats a good sign i guess
[16:13:05] <acidjazz> so .container is giving me a 1
[16:13:25] <acidjazz> but the child div clearly <div class="page work"> is giving me a 0 w/ .filter('.page') and .filter('.work')
[16:14:36] <NoiseEee> acidjazz: so the quick answer is, whatever you're calling .filter on isn't what you think it is.
[16:18:25] <hlvwrk> x_x
[16:21:43] <acidjazz> i cna see the source though
[16:21:44] <acidjazz>    <div class="container">
[16:21:51] <acidjazz>       <div class="page work">
[16:22:07] <hlvwrk> why would you wrap a div with another div.
[16:22:11] <hlvwrk> <_>
[16:22:28] <robertmaxrees> divitis.
[16:22:29] <hlvwrk> dumb question
[16:22:44] <acidjazz> so strange like.. every element after .container just cant be found
[16:22:45] <hlvwrk> you should ID the container if there's only one on the page though
[16:22:53] <acidjazz> i tried ID'ing, no difference
[16:23:01] <acidjazz> i threw id's everywehre
[16:23:02] <hlvwrk> classes are meant to be shared. ID's for single use elements
[16:23:02] <hlvwrk> <_>
[16:23:05] <acidjazz> yea i know
[16:23:36] <acidjazz> if I load hte HTML page by itself
[16:23:46] <acidjazz> i do $('.container').length $('.page').length $('.work').length i get 1
[16:23:47] <acidjazz> every time
[16:24:24] <acidjazz> if i $.get('/work/').success(function(result) -> console.log($(result).filter('.container').length); });
[16:24:27] <acidjazz> i get 1
[16:24:30] <acidjazz> but page and .work 0
[16:24:35] <acidjazz> .page and .work
[16:25:10] <acidjazz> .filter('body').length is 0
[16:25:32] <DarkElement> https://gist.github.com/DarkElement75/91c4065476ae5671bddc IN this bit of my code when I execute it instead of changing only the margin-top attribute of the element being hovered over it changes all elemnts with the.img-links class. When I do .css('transform', 'scale(1)') or something other than margin it works fine. Why is this and how can I fix it?
[16:25:43] <acidjazz> .filter('html').length i get 0
[16:25:46] <acidjazz> wnat in the fuck
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement you sure it isn't just causing the page to look like that?
[16:26:25] <robertmaxrees> like, does the source actually change to reflect that?
[16:26:53] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, it moves the other ones a smaller amount, but I can't find any changes in their element's css
[16:26:59] <DarkElement> really confusing
[16:27:09] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement sounds like a layout issue then.
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> they're not actually changing in that case.
[16:28:06] <DarkElement> I just need to figure out why when I change the margin of an element it changes the other elements a little as well
[16:28:22] <robertmaxrees> because it's causing the layout to push them there.
[16:28:34] <DarkElement> Yea
[16:28:52] <DarkElement> And I have no idea why because it's just 4 <a><img></img></a> 's
[16:29:04] <robertmaxrees> are they display block?
[16:29:06] <acidjazz> what a good jsfiddle-y like setup w/ jquery
[16:29:11] <acidjazz> so ic an show you guys this retardation
[16:29:12] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, they might be
[16:29:20] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz not an OK word btw.
[16:30:02] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, they are display: inline
[16:30:04] <acidjazz> jisfiddle?
[16:31:38] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz ;) you know what i meant.
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement that'd do it iirc. layout funk.
[16:31:55] <acidjazz> whats better than jsfiddle
[16:31:58] <acidjazz> taht has jquery built in
[16:32:07] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, I tried changing it to both inline-block and block, neither worked
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz jsfiddle can use jquery just fine.
[16:32:40] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement what if you use padding?
[16:33:07] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, it will mess up the images
[16:33:13] <DarkElement> I'll try it on the a tags though
[16:33:14] <acidjazz> you have to like feed it a jquery url right?
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz there's a dropdown for it.
[16:33:50] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, nope, didn't affect it at all with modififying the <a> tags
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon in the javascript box and go from there.
[16:34:32] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, if I just make it a negative margin-bottom it fixed it
[16:34:35] <DarkElement> lmao alright
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement heh that's one way.
[16:34:59] <DarkElement> Guess so! XD
[16:37:01] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: so if i do .filter('.container').length i get 1 compared to .page and .work
[16:37:08] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: but watch when i .filter('.container')[0]
[16:37:32] <acidjazz> http://imgur.com/U9nZzXX
[16:37:51] <acidjazz> why is this so broken
[16:38:31] <acidjazz> ok now if i do a .filter('.container').find('.page.work').length i get 1
[16:38:50] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle?
[16:38:56] <acidjazz> i cant paste the entire html page into fiddle
[16:38:57] <acidjazz> it breaks
[16:39:02] <acidjazz> i tried 20 times
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:39:07] <acidjazz> i tred codepen
[16:39:08] <acidjazz> tried*
[16:39:11] <acidjazz> maybe if i base64 it
[16:39:17] <acidjazz> tried escapeing everything
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> something here just seems really strange.
[16:39:40] <acidjazz> let me try encoding it somehow
[16:39:47] <acidjazz> actually i can get it online
[16:39:51] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.

[16:40:42] <acidjazz> http://sake.256.codes/jst/spa.js
[16:40:45] <hlvwrk> o_O
[16:40:48] <z1haze2> for some reason I cant get the success() function after my ajax call to run.. it seems to only run the error: even when the data response is a 200
[16:41:02] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 the response can be malformed.
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> which will trigger the effor.
[16:41:09] <robertmaxrees> *error
[16:41:27] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: spa.js is what im working w/, check out the console and youll see the console.log's
[16:41:54] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: itll all run on load
[16:42:11] <z1haze2> how should it be formed?
[16:42:21] <claytonzaugg> Does anyone know the best way to debug ios Safari using the emulator on a mac?
[16:42:29] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 it should be valid, whatever format it is.
[16:42:45] <z1haze2> ok
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 what's the ajax call and what's the returned data?
[16:42:58] <z1haze2> i dont return anything, its not necessary
[16:43:08] <acidjazz> z1haze2: jsfiddle
[16:43:21] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 the response? actually, it is.
[16:43:27] <robertmaxrees> it should be valid data.
[16:43:39] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz i'ma be honest and point out that i'm not digging through all that :)
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> sorry man.
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> good luck though.
[16:43:55] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: its 8 lines of code
[16:44:02] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees:  i seperated it all out
[16:44:03] <z1haze2> ok so if i physically return nothing then ... how could it not be formatted correctly
[16:44:14] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 the response from your server is invalid.
[16:44:17] <robertmaxrees> hence the error.
[16:44:20] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees:  http://sake.256.codes/jst/spa.js
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz so what're you trying to do here?
[16:44:48] <z1haze2> how does it have to be formatted then.. i dont understand if i dont return anything how can i format nothing.
[16:44:53] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: thats doing a .get on the work page and then im trying to extract a certain element
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 are you specifying a datatype or something in the ajax call?
[16:45:09] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: but i get strange results, look at those console.log's and see what your browser gives you
[16:45:21] <z1haze2> no
[16:45:23] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz why don't you use .load() and pass in the selector?
[16:45:29] <z1haze2> i dont pass any data, i dont receive any data
[16:45:31] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 without seeing the ajax call then it's card to help.
[16:45:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 then i dunno.  i'd need to see it.
[16:45:42] <z1haze2> ok
[16:46:02] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: not a bad idea, but im still worried about .get and these elements not being found
[16:46:34] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: why is it filtering .container but not body, html, or .page?
[16:46:42] <z1haze2> http://dpaste.com/2WJFF67
[16:47:08] <robertmaxrees> btw those returns don't make any sense acidjazz
[16:47:29] <acidjazz> which returns
[16:47:36] <acidjazz> i just have console.log()'s
[16:47:47] <robertmaxrees> return console.log($(result).filter('.container').find('.page.work').length);
[16:47:50] <robertmaxrees> return $.get('/work/').success(function(result) {
[16:48:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, no idea.
[16:48:50] <acidjazz> did you see hte 0's and 1's in your console.log robertmaxrees
[16:49:00] <acidjazz> did you see how body and html return 0 but .container returns 1
[16:49:05] <z1haze2> so as a test i just fire an alert() inside the fail, success, and its hitting the fail each time
[16:49:11] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz yes. i also played around with the ajax call individually.
[16:49:20] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: same results?
[16:49:29] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz yeah.  no idea man.
[16:49:37] <acidjazz> maybe its all my inline svg
[16:49:37] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 dataType: 'json',
[16:49:40] <acidjazz> or headers
[16:49:42] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[16:49:48] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz it shouldn't matter.  is the page valid?
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> headers can break things, too.
[16:50:09] <acidjazz> lemme check w3
[16:52:16] <acidjazz> yea robertmaxrees looks like its htis inline svg w/ a stray doctype
[16:52:24] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it then.
[16:52:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just return the specific stuff you need?
[16:52:41] <robertmaxrees> instead of the entire page?
[16:53:17] <z1haze2> thanks robertmaxrees
[16:53:23] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 was that it?
[16:53:35] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: zero back end
[16:53:40] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: SPA style on an s3 bucket
[16:53:51] <z1haze2> yes
[16:53:54] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz then make the individual files you need and go from there?
[16:53:54] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: id have to render an incomplete HTML page of some sort
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 that was what i was talking about earlier with the datatype thing :)
[16:54:16] <z1haze2> oh
[16:54:17] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: like what make an html file w/ no header or footER? meh, sounds messier
[16:54:31] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz that's actually not messy at all.
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> you create your site's shell and then go from there.
[16:54:45] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: its two locations i have to render
[16:54:54] <robertmaxrees> what are you ajaxing in then?
[16:54:58] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: remember 0 back end, no php, no node, no nothing
[16:55:10] <acidjazz> im ajaxing the whole page, then pulling everything from .container into the body
[16:55:18] <acidjazz> stripping the header and footer
[16:55:20] <robertmaxrees> when clicking links?
[16:55:23] <acidjazz> yup
[16:55:26] <robertmaxrees> do it the other way.
[16:55:29] <acidjazz> why
[16:55:35] <robertmaxrees> load in a shell and then ajax in the page fragments you need.
[16:55:37] <acidjazz> ajax in incomplete html
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> because it makes more architectural sense.
[16:55:44] <robertmaxrees> easier to manage.
[16:55:56] <acidjazz> but you have two locations of the same html
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:05] <acidjazz> how does that make more sense
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you'd have it once.
[16:56:24] <acidjazz> but then you're depending on the ajax to make the entire page every time?
[16:56:29] <acidjazz> like front end templating?
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you could also use a templating engine to handle all of that.
[16:56:52] <acidjazz> i thought about this
[16:56:58] <acidjazz> yea im using jade
[16:57:00] <acidjazz> which supports front end
[16:57:03] <robertmaxrees> but ajaxing in the entire page just to strip the bits you don't want is... nutty.
[16:57:09] <acidjazz> i realy dont want to overcomplicate it though
[16:57:17] <acidjazz> how is that nutty its alot simpler
[16:57:22] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing right now seems more complicated to me.
[16:57:22] <acidjazz> work/index.html works just the same
[16:57:33] <acidjazz> you're saying have like
[16:57:36] <acidjazz> work/body.html
[16:57:43] <acidjazz> which is the stripped version
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> and then a separate file for each section, yes.
[16:57:59] <acidjazz> then ican just pull and place that
[16:58:15] <acidjazz> but i still want work/index.html to be able to render the whole page
[16:58:18] <robertmaxrees> or use JSON and then pull that in and render things as needed.
[16:58:22] <robertmaxrees> why do you need that?>
[16:58:25] <acidjazz> are you saying work/index.html ajax'es body.html in?
[16:58:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you should have one file that's the "shell" of the page and ajax in content areas as necessary.
[16:59:07] <acidjazz> i think that might be a little sweeter in a sense but still seems overcomplicated then makgin a completely flat static website w/ SPA functionality stripping down to .container
[16:59:21] <NoiseEee> acidjazz: never pull in a full <html> document into an HTML element and expect it to work properly
[16:59:24] <acidjazz> this method involves the site working fine w/ no ajax/js
[16:59:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not really "SPA functionality" and it's working around limitations in using that kind of setup.
[17:00:01] <acidjazz> i see alot of SPA sites do it this way
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:00:09] <acidjazz> what limitations
[17:00:21] <robertmaxrees> you're having to load entire html pages just to select a piece of them.
[17:00:24] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty janky imo.
[17:00:29] <acidjazz> the header and footer are nothing
[17:00:32] <acidjazz> its like 20 lines of html
[17:00:47] <robertmaxrees> still unnecessary to me.
[17:00:55] <robertmaxrees> just a lot of overhead,
[17:00:56] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[17:01:08] <acidjazz> i see your point
[17:01:15] <acidjazz> and really i only see preference differences here
[17:01:19] <acidjazz> ive built that version
[17:01:29] <robertmaxrees> i see code maintainability differences.
[17:01:33] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat :)
[17:01:35] <acidjazz> w/ this methodology i get to have a bit more control on what i refresh
[17:01:51] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[17:02:16] <acidjazz> some sections will have somewhat similar areas
[17:02:26] <acidjazz> im still deciding but this way makes it easier to toy w/ that
[17:02:35] <acidjazz> it really isnt an issue to alter things to your suggestion
[17:02:41] <acidjazz> the only pain would be rendering more html
[17:02:54] <acidjazz> and/or having hte whole site render the body via ajax
[17:03:02] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[17:03:24] <arc_> i've done this many times before
[17:03:31] <arc_> for example with a navigation that is the same on every page
[17:03:43] <arc_> but a site that is built with static html
[17:03:53] <acidjazz> whats your 2dd
[17:03:54] <arc_> so i don't have to update every html file when i want to change the navigation
[17:03:55] <acidjazz> 2c*
[17:04:15] <acidjazz> yea i have that setup i have headers and footers templated
[17:04:18] <arc_> i don't see any problem with putting the navigation html in a file on its own, and loading it into an empty div
[17:04:35] <arc_> it doesn't look any different to the end user
[17:04:41] <NoiseEee> overhead
[17:04:55] <NoiseEee> you're going to do an http request to load a piece of navigation?
[17:05:09] <arc_> if the site is simple, why not
[17:05:17] <acidjazz> i agree w/ NoiseEee
[17:05:25] <arc_> anyway, you're doing an ajax request one way or another
[17:05:39] <acidjazz> but my site will still work w/ no ajax
[17:05:47] <acidjazz> all my links are href that point to complete pages
[17:06:03] <arc_> so what is the ajax actually accomplishing
[17:06:10] <acidjazz> im just gonna override em
[17:06:36] <acidjazz> reload the body
[17:06:41] <acidjazz> give me 20m youll see :)
[17:07:44] <duckxx_> i have the following jquery. seems easy, but i'm trying to click a link and then it makes a radio button true and then clicks the submit button. but it seems that it ignores the radio button and just clicks submit. the jquery is valid as I tried testing it without clicking the submit button. http://pastebin.com/cyaLws4W
[17:08:31] <bango2> duckxx_ can you make a fiddle? something we can mess around with?
[17:08:53] <bango2> https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:09:10] <duckxx_> o ok
[17:11:04] <acidjazz> so strange, completely w3 compliant and no change
[17:14:02] <acidjazz> NoiseEee: what were you saying again about pulling in full on HTML documents
[17:14:17] <NoiseEee> just "don't do it" acidjazz
[17:15:26] <acidjazz> NoiseEee: any reason why not? and why i see it done alot?
[17:15:53] <NoiseEee> well html documents have their own <head> and <body> stuff, for one
[17:16:10] <NoiseEee> i don't think you see it done a lot, you probably see *content* being loaded in (not full html documents)
[17:16:10] <acidjazz> true
[17:16:20] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: so, fixed about 10 w3 errors, same crap w/ .get
[17:16:26] <acidjazz> relipse: .load works perfectly though
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:16:37] <acidjazz> s/relipse/robertmaxrees
[17:16:38] <b-ot> Correction, <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: .load works perfectly though
[17:16:39] <robertmaxrees> i still think your premise is flawed buuuuut whatevs.
[17:16:43] <acidjazz> .load owrks w/ any of those selecgors
[17:16:50] <relipse2> acidjazz waking me up
[17:17:24] <acidjazz> NoiseEee: no its factual a lot of setups do it, ill see the nav pull stuff in w/ its own load, check the network and its pulling in the entire html page and stripping the body content
[17:17:27] <acidjazz> sorry relipse2
[17:17:42] <taplar> :s
[17:17:59] <taplar> a lot =/= efficient
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> or good.
[17:18:10] <acidjazz> NoiseEee: would you like an example
[17:19:03] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: flawed by pulling in HTML pages and not individually compiled sections?
[17:19:20] <taplar> your returning more than your going to use
[17:19:20] <robertmaxrees> or just json with templating or something.
[17:19:48] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: waddya mean by json
[17:19:58] <acidjazz> whats the json storing
[17:20:05] <markh> the info?
[17:20:06] <acidjazz> as in header/footer/body all in one JSON file?
[17:20:09] <markh> no
[17:20:11] <acidjazz> and i either pull the body or everything?
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz the individual sections.
[17:20:25] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do it.
[17:20:31] <acidjazz> { header: "", body: "", footer: "" }
[17:20:37] <acidjazz> pretty cool idea
[17:20:40] <robertmaxrees> that way you can update templating separate from the actual data.
[17:20:45] <acidjazz> but still will break w/ no js
[17:21:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you so concerned about that?
[17:21:26] <acidjazz> couple clients are on some pretty old machines
[17:21:47] <acidjazz> larger companys w/ older IT's take longer to upgrade OSes, browsers, etc.
[17:21:55] <acidjazz> trust me i dont wnat to give a shit
[17:21:57] <acidjazz> or be concerned
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> soooo i have to worry about IE back to 8 - that setup will work for all those browsers.
[17:22:38] <acidjazz> its the basic concept of the site still working
[17:22:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.  and it will.  JS will still work, too.  very rare that it doesn't.
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[17:23:24] <acidjazz> once this works i might even shoot for a version of either broken up html or json
[17:24:06] <acidjazz> wht about something like this robertmaxrees
[17:24:17] <acidjazz> href points to work/index.html straight up all html
[17:24:29] <acidjazz> when ajax is loaded it pulls work/body.html
[17:24:39] <acidjazz> purely content for hte container
[17:24:59] <robertmaxrees> then you're one step away from just doing it the right way.
[17:25:35] <acidjazz> whic his what work/index.html loads work/header.html work/body.html work/footer.html
[17:25:35] <taplar> randomly contrived fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/uddfo7j4/
[17:26:09] <acidjazz> i dont see how mine is wrong though robertmaxrees
[17:26:11] <acidjazz> like WRONG
[17:26:25] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz you're just overcomplicating it.
[17:26:30] <acidjazz> instead of just structure preference
[17:26:41] <robertmaxrees> but whatever mang :)
[17:26:43] <robertmaxrees> do what you want.
[17:27:07] <acidjazz> im always open to try things different ways
[17:27:13] <acidjazz> maybe im not seeing your vision correctly
[17:28:23] <robertmaxrees> wait back way up - why do you want ajax in the first place?
[17:28:36] <acidjazz> smoother na
[17:28:38] <acidjazz> nav*
[17:28:52] <acidjazz> gonna put in sweet loaders
[17:28:56] <acidjazz> preload images w/ Image
[17:29:15] <acidjazz> use my http://dbar.256.codes/ when its done
[17:29:20] <robertmaxrees> so then why not load a json file of all the content area's info and render that stuff out as needed?
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> if you're worried about it being smooth, get rid of as many network requests as you can.
[17:29:46] <acidjazz> metadata
[17:30:01] <acidjazz> indexable individual pages
[17:30:09] <acidjazz> feed the spiders
[17:30:12] <robertmaxrees> you know that google is supporting that stuff, right?
[17:30:36] <acidjazz> need work and individual pages to be shareable
[17:30:47] <acidjazz> w/ specific metadata and share images
[17:30:57] <acidjazz> the og:'s and the twitter cards
[17:31:01] <robertmaxrees> lol there are solutions to all of that, but OK :)
[17:31:11] <robertmaxrees> if your current setup works, then knock yourself out.
[17:31:20] <acidjazz> so a json file of the entire site
[17:31:26] <acidjazz> then i hit /robert/
[17:31:37] <acidjazz> whta happens JS takes the json file and JS changes all the meta tags?
[17:31:43] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[17:32:20] <acidjazz> thats pretty nuts
[17:32:23] <acidjazz> i cant see how thats not nuts
[17:32:35] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang.
[17:32:37] <acidjazz> and then you're depending on every social networks crawler to obey that as well
[17:32:43] <acidjazz> are you trolling me
[17:33:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.  there are plenty of sane ways manage all of that.
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> like i said, it's find if you've found a solution that works for you.
[17:33:25] <robertmaxrees> just making sure i present the alternatives.
[17:33:36] <acidjazz> do you have an exmaple?
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> not readily available, no.
[17:33:54] <acidjazz> i just cant really imagine
[17:33:59] <acidjazz> ok well when this is done ill google it
[17:34:15] <acidjazz> like hte crawler would have to 1st scarpe any JS that related to altering metadata
[17:34:20] <acidjazz> how do you write that
[17:34:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> google's crawling sites like that now.
[17:35:32] <acidjazz> im sure google is of any site that is google would be the 1st
[17:35:42] <acidjazz> but there are a ton of others i need to support
[17:35:56] <acidjazz> s/ton/handful
[17:35:56] <b-ot> Correction, <acidjazz> but there are a handful of others i need to support
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> like YaBing, which are doing the same last i checked.
[17:36:09] <robertmaxrees> could be wrong.
[17:36:22] <markh> what do you need to support besides google and bing, and maybe yahoo?
[17:36:28] <acidjazz> facebook
[17:36:30] <markh> and really, besides google?
[17:36:30] <acidjazz> twitter
[17:36:39] <acidjazz> pinterest
[17:36:45] <acidjazz> i duno depends on each project
[17:36:47] <acidjazz> i work w/ PR agencies though
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> and Yahoo and Bing are the same engine now anyway soooo.
[17:36:54] <acidjazz> that metadata has to be perfect
[17:36:57] <robertmaxrees> and you're conflating things.
[17:37:04] <robertmaxrees> that metadata is read when things are clicked.
[17:37:27] <acidjazz> what do you mean thigns are clicked
[17:37:41] <acidjazz> its read when you lint it
[17:37:42] <acidjazz> when you share it
[17:37:47] <acidjazz> when you tweet a url
[17:37:52] <acidjazz> twitter wants those cards
[17:38:05] <robertmaxrees> correct.  those are all done in reaction to events you fire.
[17:38:13] <acidjazz> find a js-manipulated page
[17:38:13] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees:
[17:38:14] <acidjazz> https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
[17:38:17] <robertmaxrees> you can dynamically update those and the sharer will still work.
[17:38:17] <acidjazz> try that
[17:38:27] <acidjazz> no you cant ive tried
[17:38:30] <acidjazz> not most
[17:38:30] <robertmaxrees> i've done it many times.
[17:38:32] <acidjazz> not facebook i know for sure
[17:38:40] <robertmaxrees> facebook absolutely supports it.  twitter does, too.
[17:38:41] <acidjazz> lets agree to disagree
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> pinterest was the only one that didn't work very well.
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> except we're not disagreeing.  i've implemented exactly what you're talking about and it was fine.
[17:39:15] <acidjazz> wheres the example then
[17:40:20] <robertmaxrees> was somewhere on one of our sites.  I don't have it readily available.  if i come accross it again i'll be sure to let you know though ;)
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> they read those page tags when you click their "share" button though.  that's my point.
[17:41:34] <acidjazz> what share button
[17:41:41] <acidjazz> what site
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:41:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not doing this any more with you.
[17:41:57] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[17:43:52] <acidjazz> everythign i google says you are crazy
[17:44:21] <acidjazz> a couple thigns say its somewhat supported now but crazy
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> cool :)
[17:44:35] <acidjazz> https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.fi/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html
[17:48:35] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: are u there?
[17:48:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:48:50] <deadevilboy> each function checks a class even if it is a comment?
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:49:31] <deadevilboy> remember that problem I had about each duplicating the results on my code?
[17:49:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:50:31] <deadevilboy> I mean, does .each function detect a commented selector?
[17:50:38] <robertmaxrees> "a commented selector"?
[17:50:41] <robertmaxrees> what is that?
[17:50:56] <deadevilboy> a selector between comments
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> show me what you mean.
[17:51:03] <deadevilboy> sorry for the bad word
[17:51:24] <deadevilboy> <!-- <input class="etc_etc"> -->
[17:52:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost lol.  are you saying you're selecting commented out html somehow?
[17:52:33] <taplar> i think he's asking if commented nodes would be found in the dom
[17:52:44] <robertmaxrees> they shouldn't be found via jquery, no.
[17:52:47] <deadevilboy> no, I am asking if it is possible that each could find a some input class name that is between a comment sentence
[17:52:53] <deadevilboy> ok...
[17:52:55] <markh> no
[17:53:01] <robertmaxrees> that's commented code.
[17:53:10] <taplar> commented code should not be parsed into the dom
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> you're explicitly saying you don't want it parsed - you want it to be ignored.
[17:53:20] <taplar> which is where your 'searching'
[17:53:22] <deadevilboy> ok,... because I thouth that was the problem of my previous question
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> it's actually in the DOM, but as a comment.
[17:53:35] <deadevilboy> *thougth
[17:53:41] <taplar> hm
[17:53:42] <robertmaxrees> not a normal node though.
[17:53:50] <taplar> learned something
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can actually still find them via the API, just awkward (for obvious reasons)
[17:54:08] <deadevilboy> hmm so it must be some other feature I can't find.. yet.. heheh
[17:54:19] <markh> you can traverse the dom and find the comments if you gather, say, the innerHTML of an element that contains a comment
[17:54:19] <deadevilboy> thanks :))
[17:54:24] <robertmaxrees> show us what's going on?
[17:54:25] <taplar> deadevilboy you got a fiddle with the issue?
[17:54:44] <deadevilboy> taplar: no.. I did one similar but on fiddle it works ok
[17:55:04] <deadevilboy> I can't simulate the other cause it is complex
[17:55:23] <taplar> well, you could always console.log your finder to see the elements found
[17:55:28] <deadevilboy> I will try to put small lines of code on the big project..
[17:56:06] <deadevilboy> because .each finds the class name.. and it knows it is only index 0 element
[17:56:16] <deadevilboy> however, it doubles the console log output
[17:56:26] <taplar> huh?
[17:56:57] <deadevilboy> imagine u use .each function to check how many classnames do u have with the same name on your code
[17:57:07] <taplar> $(selector).length
[17:57:26] <deadevilboy> exactly
[17:57:28] <deadevilboy> but on my code
[17:57:51] <deadevilboy> everytime it does that.. even if it is only one classname, the output is doubled
[17:57:56] <deadevilboy> imagine it says hello
[17:57:58] <taplar> your length is 2?
[17:58:02] <deadevilboy> you see: hello, hello
[17:58:05] <deadevilboy> no, just 1
[17:58:29] <markh> did you like... rewrite console.log or something? lol
[17:58:37] <deadevilboy> strange.. but I made it simple on fiddle and it works ok
[17:58:46] <deadevilboy> no..
[17:59:12] <taplar> so if you console.log the selector length you get 1
[17:59:20] <taplar> but when you do the each, your result is doubled
[17:59:43] <taplar> what are you doing in your each?
[17:59:59] <markh> i mean, this is kind of pointless to speculate about without seeing the code
[18:00:00] <taplar> and if you know there is/should be only one, why do an each?
[18:00:31] <deadevilboy> because it only happens when length is = 1
[18:00:38] <deadevilboy> after that, everything goes ok
[18:00:50] <deadevilboy> I am building a crash report db
[18:01:00] <deadevilboy> and when u add one car, np
[18:01:13] <deadevilboy> then when u add a second one, I check if it is already added
[18:01:38] <deadevilboy> so if it is already added, it should send an alert to the user, and u can't add it
[18:02:17] <deadevilboy> but when u have only one added car, the alert appears twice
[18:02:35] <deadevilboy> but if u have 2 cars, the alert only appears once.. which is ok
[18:03:07] <taplar> your doing this logic on some event?
[18:03:18] <robertmaxrees> wait is the logic happening... twice?
[18:03:22] <taplar> :)
[18:03:28] <taplar> you may be double binding your event handler
[18:03:57] <deadevilboy> the logic is running twice is
[18:04:12] <deadevilboy> but there is only one class name (hidden) input with the license plate
[18:04:18] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> if the logic is running twice, then you'll see things duplicated.
[18:04:52] <deadevilboy> but the logic is similar to the one you saw on fiddle
[18:05:04] <robertmaxrees> right, but if yopu're binding the same event listener twice...
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[18:05:11] <deadevilboy> but it is like ".each" is running twice with only one classname
[18:05:19] <deadevilboy> hmmmm
[18:05:28] <robertmaxrees> put a console log as the first thing in your handler.
[18:05:30] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[18:05:39] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: I understand what you are saying
[18:05:42] <deadevilboy> just wait a sec then
[18:07:53] <deadevilboy> hmmm I have to study again the whole process
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> so you
[18:08:02] <robertmaxrees> *you're binding twice?
[18:08:05] <deadevilboy> no..
[18:08:47] <deadevilboy> but maybe is some other function that is running on another js file.. because I changed the whole code these days
[18:08:57] <deadevilboy> I will check the whole code and the loops
[18:09:03] <deadevilboy> and then I will say something
[18:09:08] <deadevilboy> thks guys for the effort
[18:09:10] <taplar> did the console log print twice?
[18:09:13] <deadevilboy> yes..
[18:09:16] <deadevilboy> 1 1
[18:09:23] <robertmaxrees> the console log at the beginning of the event handler?
[18:10:00] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:10:04] <deadevilboy> then only shows 2
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> then that means your handler is being bound twice.
[18:10:09] <deadevilboy> and then 3
[18:10:11] <deadevilboy> and so on
[18:10:25] <robertmaxrees> so that confirms our suspicion.
[18:10:29] <deadevilboy> it must be some other function on another file..
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever you're calling to do your binding.s
[18:10:45] <robertmaxrees> how are you running the binding?
[18:11:06] <deadevilboy> hmm
[18:11:14] <deadevilboy> I guess I know the problem
[18:11:19] <deadevilboy> see if this has logic
[18:11:25] <deadevilboy> there is a counter
[18:11:38] <deadevilboy> and that counter increases when u add a new vehicle to the report
[18:12:13] <deadevilboy> so it checks if the counter is 0. If it is, then u can add vehicle function. And in THAT function, counter gets ++.
[18:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you can just use .length instead of a global state var.
[18:12:30] <robertmaxrees> but that has literally nothing to do with multiple bindings.
[18:12:33] <deadevilboy> so when I say if counter > 0 to do the console log, it will duplicate the event right?
[18:12:42] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what that means.
[18:12:43] <taplar> it depends on how your binding
[18:12:53] <taplar> are you binding on the new element, or doing a lookup and binding
[18:13:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[18:13:55] <deadevilboy> lookup and then binding
[18:14:06] <taplar> so your finding both the preexisting elements and the new elements
[18:14:11] <taplar> element
[18:14:16] <deadevilboy> exactly
[18:14:29] <taplar> so see the issue?
[18:14:35] <SmashingX> how can I retrieve the value of a jquery text editor?
[18:14:52] <robertmaxrees> you're calling .click() or .on() more than once, deadevilboy, that's what we mean.
[18:14:56] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX of a whatnow?
[18:15:08] <SmashingX> I tried this $('#id').jqteVal()
[18:15:10] <deadevilboy> hmm..
[18:15:12] <SmashingX> but I get undefined
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX is this of a particular plugin?
[18:15:26] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: jqte
[18:15:34] <deadevilboy> nop
[18:15:38] <deadevilboy> there is only one
[18:15:53] <deadevilboy> on click "add" you make the comparison
[18:16:05] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy you're not understanding l;ol
[18:16:07] <deadevilboy> and it checks the preexisted code if there is a class
[18:16:21] <deadevilboy> maybe it is my fault yes
[18:16:28] <deadevilboy> lool
[18:16:31] <deadevilboy> sorry guys
[18:16:34] <robertmaxrees> we're not talking about the code inside the handler.
[18:16:39] <taplar> so step through the logic
[18:16:45] <taplar> you create a new element
[18:16:55] <taplar> you find all (1) of them, and bind
[18:17:03] <taplar> next time, you create another one
[18:17:08] <deadevilboy> exactly
[18:17:10] <taplar> you find all (2) of them and bind
[18:17:13] <deadevilboy> but it won't be created
[18:17:16] <taplar> so that first one is bound twice
[18:17:32] <deadevilboy> unless it is different from the previous
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy we're not talking about the code inside the handler though.
[18:18:19] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:18:22] <deadevilboy> I see
[18:18:27] <deadevilboy> it works just like that yes
[18:18:44] <deadevilboy> then u add another, then u bind it
[18:18:52] <taplar> you said you do a lookup
[18:19:32] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX looks like you use .val()
[18:19:53] <deadevilboy> I mean, it searches for the code already appended
[18:19:58] <taplar> yep
[18:20:10] <taplar> so would that selector not match both the new and old elements?
[18:20:16] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:20:19] <taplar> ok
[18:20:38] <deadevilboy> well
[18:20:48] <deadevilboy> is not match
[18:21:02] <deadevilboy> it will just count how many do it has and compare the value
[18:21:04] <robertmaxrees> without seeing a more complete example it's really hard to help you.
[18:21:08] <deadevilboy> if license plate is the same, bla bla bla
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what we're trying to tell you.
[18:21:44] <taplar> the part where you do $(someSelector).on(event, function(){ ... });
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[18:21:53] <taplar> that 'someSelector', would that not match the old and new elements?
[18:22:59] <deadevilboy> well... the new code is a function inside that on event yes
[18:23:08] <taplar> ignore the code inside
[18:23:11] <taplar> that selector
[18:23:15] <taplar> lol
[18:23:20] <taplar> would it not match both the old and new?
[18:23:36] <robertmaxrees> replace your code with just $(someSelector).on(event, function(){ console.log('hello') });, making the someselector whatever you're using right now.
[18:23:46] <robertmaxrees> and the event with yours.
[18:23:48] <deadevilboy> hmm
[18:23:53] <deadevilboy> I see the point
[18:23:57] <robertmaxrees> if it runs multiple times, you're binding multiple times.
[18:24:19] <taplar> you should hopefully understand the issue, but really you'd probably be better off with a delegate
[18:24:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[18:24:33] <deadevilboy> so it means if that is the problem, the console log should appears twice 2
[18:24:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:25:12] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees:
[18:25:43] <deadevilboy> console log shows only one click the 1st time
[18:25:50] <robertmaxrees> i have a really hard time believing that.
[18:25:56] <taplar> and the second timne?
[18:25:58] <deadevilboy> the second time, it only shows 2 clicks
[18:26:02] <taplar> :)
[18:26:06] <deadevilboy> and interestingly
[18:26:12] <robertmaxrees> "only shows 2 clicks" as in you get 2 new console logs?
[18:26:16] <robertmaxrees> and the third you're getting three?
[18:26:17] <deadevilboy> the number of the length is only one
[18:26:45] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  you're re-binding things then.
[18:26:56] <deadevilboy> you are rigth robert
[18:27:18] <deadevilboy> but then length is only showing once now
[18:27:24] <deadevilboy> with that console log
[18:27:24] <deadevilboy> lol
[18:27:31] <deadevilboy> even if it is the 1st time
[18:27:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're all confused.
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> are you re-binding because new elements are getting added to the page?
[18:28:25] <deadevilboy> I supposed I wasn't
[18:28:36] <taplar> the console says otherwise, :)
[18:28:39] <deadevilboy> but is what I'm saying, maybe I am using another js file
[18:28:44] <deadevilboy> and it is doubling the code
[18:29:03] <deadevilboy> let me just check that
[18:29:17] <deadevilboy> and I will say something then
[18:31:17] <deadevilboy> hmm
[18:31:30] <deadevilboy> can it be because the search div is allocated dinamically?
[18:31:37] <deadevilboy> and then it removes the code
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> your JS is calling that binding more than once.
[18:31:53] <deadevilboy> and everytime u add the vehicle, it recreats that div
[18:31:54] <robertmaxrees> you need to not do that.
[18:31:58] <robertmaxrees> that's literally the problem.
[18:32:15] <deadevilboy> hmmm
[18:32:19] <deadevilboy> then that is the problem
[18:32:29] <deadevilboy> I understand more or less why
[18:32:36] <taplar> what's confusing you?
[18:32:39] <deadevilboy> then how can I prevent it?
[18:32:43] <SmashingX> with jquery I'm checking if an elemnt is empty (textarea) if it is I show an alert if not I would like to submit a form, and continue in php how can I do this?
[18:32:58] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX are you checking on submit?
[18:33:16] <deadevilboy> do I need to load that search.html only once?
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:33:30] <taplar> lets back up
[18:33:38] <taplar> do you understand what the issue is?
[18:33:43] <deadevilboy> more or less
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> does your search.html have the javascript in it?
[18:33:51] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:33:54] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:33:58] <deadevilboy> I was using .getscript
[18:33:59] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: I have my HTML code with a button with this: onclick=\"function($('#textarea'))\">Post My Entry
[18:34:06] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX don't use onclick.
[18:34:08] <deadevilboy> everytime I recreated search div dinamically
[18:34:17] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: then?
[18:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to us .on('submit', function() {}); against the form.
[18:34:34] <robertmaxrees> check if valid.  if not, preventDefault() against the event.
[18:34:54] <robertmaxrees>  .on('submit', function(e) { if (notValid) { e.preventDefault();) } });
[18:35:15] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees:  but I have multiple textareas with their own submit buttons in the same page, is this going to work?
[18:35:30] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX you can bind to multiple forms, yes.
[18:35:35] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: I see what u mean
[18:35:37] <robertmaxrees> youy should never use inline event handlers.
[18:35:51] <deadevilboy> I am calling the script evertime I recreate search
[18:35:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:35:57] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:36:00] <robertmaxrees> load the JS once.
[18:36:03] <deadevilboy> so it does 2 times the same script
[18:36:05] <robertmaxrees> feel free to reload the html as much as you want.
[18:36:08] <deadevilboy> then 3 and so one
[18:36:09] <robertmaxrees> but load the JS only once.
[18:36:10] <deadevilboy> *on
[18:36:16] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: and where do I specify the form?
[18:36:18] <deadevilboy> thanks
[18:36:22] <deadevilboy> grrrrrrrrrrrr
[18:36:27] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX $('yurselector').on(....
[18:36:40] <deadevilboy> we are always learning
[18:36:53] <deadevilboy> sorry to bother u with a simple problem
[18:36:59] <deadevilboy> newbie :D
[18:37:04] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ SmashingX deadevilboy this would be an awesome read for both of you :)
[18:37:08] <taplar> without code it was like playing clue, :)
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> at least up through events.
[18:37:21] <SmashingX> learn jquery?
[18:37:22] <SmashingX> lol
[18:37:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:37:29] <deadevilboy> yes
[18:37:30] <deadevilboy> hehehe
[18:37:30] <deadevilboy> :D
[18:37:37] <deadevilboy> thank you guys
[18:37:47] <deadevilboy> for the effort
[18:37:50] <SmashingX> I jsut want to do something simple
[18:37:56] <SmashingX> and that would take me the whole week
[18:38:07] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX reading up through events?  would take you a few hours tops.
[18:38:10] <taplar> deadevilboy if your unfamiliar with them, look into delegate bindings
[18:38:18] <robertmaxrees> you should know the basics of the library.
[18:38:38] <deadevilboy> the on click was delegated
[18:38:49] <deadevilboy> but I shouldn't use document
[18:38:52] <deadevilboy> as a selector
[18:38:59] <SmashingX> hey by youtselector you mean the button or the textarea?
[18:39:05] <taplar> right, avoid if you can
[18:39:15] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX i mean the form.
[18:39:24] <deadevilboy> use the last # before appending code right?
[18:39:31] <taplar> hmm?
[18:39:46] <taplar> the parent your appending to you mean
[18:39:49] <deadevilboy> the last selector before the code that is being allocated dinamically
[18:39:53] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:40:00] <robertmaxrees> you're really lost.
[18:40:16] <deadevilboy> sorry if I don't use the right expressions
[18:40:19] <deadevilboy> yes taplar
[18:40:23] <deadevilboy> the parent
[18:40:31] <taplar> yeah, would be a safe bet probably
[18:41:02] <deadevilboy> sometimes I don't express what I mean the right way... sorry guys. either technically or in english
[18:44:23] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: hey man but I don't know if this will work with all the dynamically generated forms
[18:45:07] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX then you use event delegation instead.
[18:51:29] <SmashingX> well I don't know if it's possible but all the forms will have the names like form-1 form-2 form-3
[18:51:41] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[18:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you bind to a parent element of all the forms and use delegation.
[18:52:03] <SmashingX> no I was referring to .on('submit', function(e) { if (notValid) { e.preventDefault();) } });
[18:52:03] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:52:07] <SmashingX> if I could use this
[18:52:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use that.
[18:52:12] <robertmaxrees> use delegation.
[18:52:14] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[18:52:19] <robertmaxrees> and yes, you can still do that.
[18:52:31] <arc_> delegation is extremely easy to use
[18:52:34] <SmashingX> oh man
[18:55:40] <SmashingX> I read it but Im not sure how it will work in my case
[18:55:49] <SmashingX> plus I don't know how I will be able to submit the form
[18:55:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:56:01] <robertmaxrees> so you have multiple forms right?
[18:56:04] <SmashingX> ok here's the thing
[18:56:24] <SmashingX> to submit it I have to call a PHP function so I write thing in the database
[18:56:37] <robertmaxrees> how do you plan on calling that?
[18:56:43] <SmashingX> or basically the contents of the textarea into a table
[18:56:48] <robertmaxrees> you know your JS can't, like, magically call your PHP right?
[18:57:00] <SmashingX> well I don't know that's why Im here
[18:57:07] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:57:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, php and js live in two different worlds.
[18:57:24] <robertmaxrees> you can use ajax if you need to call something specific.
[18:57:33] <robertmaxrees> and then setup an endpoint or whatever.
[18:57:44] <SmashingX> danm
[18:58:26] <SmashingX> well al I want javascrit to do is to check if there's something in the textarea
[18:58:30] <SmashingX> some content
[18:58:31] <robertmaxrees> then you can do that.
[18:58:34] <robertmaxrees> with what i showed you.
[18:58:43] <SmashingX> all this seems so complicated just to check that
[18:59:05] <robertmaxrees> you want to stop submission, right?
[18:59:39] <SmashingX> if there's nothing in the textarea yes
[18:59:51] <SmashingX> that would cause problems in the SQL
[18:59:58] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need to bind to the form submit and preventDefault() against the event object.
[19:00:03] <robertmaxrees> also your php should check, too.
[19:00:45] <robertmaxrees> bbiab.
[19:02:41] <SmashingX> I've never used ajax :(
[19:03:20] <taplar> not that difficult.  however I would say get your delegate binding and validation working first
[19:30:05] <SmashingX>  /msg NickServ identify lokisimo
[19:30:14] <robertmaxrees> oops.
[19:30:17] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:30:24] <SmashingX> wtf
[19:30:34] <taplar> good thing this room isn't logged
[19:30:35] <robertmaxrees> you has spaces in front of the /
[19:30:38] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[19:30:43] <SmashingX> I know
[19:30:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> sure it is lol
[19:30:56] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[19:30:58] <SmashingX> sometimes happen but Im not in any channel
[19:30:59] * taplar knows
[19:31:09] <SmashingX> I'm going to change the password anyway
[19:31:15] <SmashingX> so it doesn't matter if is logged
[19:31:21] <taplar> :)
[19:33:18] <SmashingX> ok password changed
[19:34:57] <arc_> make a command /id so you can identify without having to actually type your password into the box :p
[19:35:11] <taplar> or do it in the nickserv window
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> or just have your client do it for you silently.
[19:35:22] <arc_> sure, those are also options
[19:42:51] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: you mean something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/3t7k5s8h/
[19:42:56] <SmashingX> I'm working on the first form only
[19:46:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3t7k5s8h/1/
[19:46:22] <robertmaxrees> this.,
[19:49:52] <SmashingX> so you are saying I should submit the form in the else statement? robertmaxrees
[19:50:05] <robertmaxrees> the form will submit if you don't hit the if.
[19:50:44] <SmashingX> ok got it the thing I don't understand yet is how I'm going to be able to submit the right one and no all the forms
[19:51:01] <robertmaxrees> why would it submit all the forms?
[19:51:06] <robertmaxrees> you're inly working with one.
[19:51:09] <robertmaxrees> *only.
[19:51:38] <SmashingX> well like I said they are going to be generated from the database
[19:51:52] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do woith your js.
[19:51:56] <SmashingX> and each one will have a submit button so how will I know which is the one Im submitting?
[19:52:12] <robertmaxrees> $(this).
[19:52:17] <robertmaxrees> are you doing ajax?
[19:52:33] <SmashingX> no
[19:52:40] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[19:52:42] <SmashingX> I don't have any idea yet how I will do that thing
[19:52:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to worry about it.
[19:53:00] <SmashingX> becuase I will need to call a php function for submitting it
[19:53:01] <robertmaxrees> the form will submit as it does today if it has a value.
[19:54:01] <SmashingX> right but I'm submitting nothing
[19:54:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:54:09] <SmashingX> I mean my form is doing nothing right now
[19:54:13] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:54:39] <SmashingX> the I need to do ajax to call my php function?
[19:54:40] <SmashingX> right?
[19:54:58] <robertmaxrees> doing this with ajax will be done a little differently.
[19:55:11] <robertmaxrees> in that case you'll ALWAYS preventDefault() and conditionally run ajax.
[19:55:15] <SmashingX> ok let me understand this
[19:55:49] <SmashingX> in this case you are saying I should just write my php call function in the same HTML page where I have the form?
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:55:59] <SmashingX> so I don't use ajax correct?
[19:56:05] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[19:56:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:56:17] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP, but you'd do a normal form.
[19:56:22] <robertmaxrees> however you tradtionally do that.
[19:56:31] <robertmaxrees> the PHP knows nothing about your JS.
[19:56:34] <robertmaxrees> full stop.
[19:56:43] <SmashingX> got it
[19:57:17] <SmashingX> ok the problem here is that I have many forms no just one
[19:57:23] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[19:57:31] <robertmaxrees> you use a single delegated listener for all of them.
[19:57:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of using IDs, you use calsses.
[19:57:47] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.someInput').val(), etc.
[19:58:19] <SmashingX> but someinput is in each form
[19:58:32] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:58:34] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the form.
[19:58:37] <SmashingX> so if someinput is empty in at least one form it will trigger the alert
[19:58:39] <robertmaxrees> .find() will get you the one you want.
[19:58:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:58:44] <robertmaxrees> only the current form.
[19:58:48] <SmashingX> ok
[19:58:51] <SmashingX> let me try it then
[19:58:52] <robertmaxrees> this is why you should check out the learning center.
[19:59:02] <robertmaxrees> all of this material is in there and you'd be done in a few hours :)
[19:59:14] <taplar> and benefit greatly
[19:59:19] <robertmaxrees> yes!
[19:59:22] <SmashingX> ok where is that?
[19:59:26] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[19:59:29] <SmashingX> ok
[19:59:35] <SmashingX> well thanks man
[19:59:38] <SmashingX> for your time
[19:59:49] <robertmaxrees> the first three sections cover all the bases :)
[20:04:32] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: I think you meant this? https://jsfiddle.net/3t7k5s8h/2/
[20:05:04] <robertmaxrees> i meant what i meant.
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> if you want to change your reqs, then sure.
[20:05:19] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use alerts.
[20:07:46] <SmashingX> what should I use instead?
[20:07:51] <arc_> console.log
[20:13:02] <SmashingX> but for that I have to fire up the developer tools in chrome
[20:13:17] <SmashingX> I mean it seems like more work, why would you recommend that one instead
[20:13:17] <taplar> life's hard
[20:13:49] <taplar> alert's freeze up the browser and can obsure timing issues.
[20:14:53] <rcyr> SmashingX: You should always have them running when developing anyway. Even more if you're a beginner.
[20:15:17] <arc_> that, and if you need to use multiple debugging outputs at once, you don't have to click ok 4 times every time you run the page
[20:15:31] <arc_> and clicking ok doesn't get rid of your debugging info, it just stays in the log
[21:34:46] <acidjazz> man history.pushState stuff is funky
[22:24:42] <aro> i am creating an iframe dynamically and inserting it to the dom, i then set the src attribute
[22:24:49] <aro> is there a way to callback a function when that src has loaded?
[22:31:23] <aro> anyone know
[22:51:25] <aro> would be awesome
[22:54:18] <taplar> have you tried binding a load event to the iframe?
[22:57:40] <aro> yes
[22:57:43] <aro> ive tried everything
[22:57:52] <aro> its a downloading pdf
[22:57:55] <taplar> did you try binding to the inner document?
[22:57:57] <aro> that is inside that iframe
[22:58:01] <aro> i cant really do that
[22:58:13] <aro> since its a pdf
[23:03:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kf0fc49z/
[23:04:45] <aro> you used .ready?
[23:04:48] <aro> let me try that
[23:06:54] <aro> are you sure its not calling that immediately?
[23:07:02] <taplar> not sure
[23:07:24] <arc_> i keep looking at this thinking i'm talking and being like i don't remember saying anything
[23:07:48] <taplar> did you address this earlier?
[23:08:07] <arc_> i'm not sure what you mean
[23:08:17] <arc_> i'm talking about because that guy's nick looks like mine
[23:08:22] <taplar> ah
[23:08:25] <arc_> :p
[23:08:25] <aro> lol
[23:08:32] <aro> im not a guy ;)
[23:08:42] <arc_> w/e
[23:08:45] <aro> haha
[23:17:03] <taplar> hmm, not sure that it will work
[23:17:25] <taplar> lot of the stuff i'm seeing is that it won't work or it only works in some browsers.
[23:17:54] <arc_> could you just use like .. a scrolling div instead of an iframe
[23:18:13] <arc_> i don't remember if it's even possible to embed a pdf on a page anymore
[23:18:27] <arc_> i always see them being opened in a new tab
[23:18:32] <taplar> yeah i'm doing it in the fiddle
[23:18:49] <taplar> depending on the headers returned you can force it to open in a new window
[23:19:46] <taplar> we did that in one of our invoicing applications
[23:20:44] <taplar> strange though that load doesn't fire.  or i wonder if i'm hitting a cors issue since i'm using a pdf from another side
[23:20:55] <taplar> even though it is loading
[23:23:05] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/164085/javascript-callback-when-iframe-is-finished-loading#209723  if it's on the same domain
[23:24:10] <taplar> anyway, late for me.  gotta crash.  l8r
