[01:41:07] <Ritzton> bonjour, dans une chaine de caractère, je souhaiterais remplacer tous les mots qui finissent par ".png" en <img src="XXXX.png" />, je ne suis pas trop doué pour les regex, pourriez vous m'aider svp ?
[01:47:28] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[01:48:36] <marvi> Ritzton: try English.
[01:49:22] <JoeSa> Using .click() or .trigger('click') on a submit button seems to behave differently than actually clicking it, as my .click handler for the button returns false and so on user click doesn't submit the form (and does some AJAX work), however using jQuery to .click on the button means the form gets submitted (which isn't what I want, of course).
[01:50:21] <Jonno_FTW> why is my jquery so slow when I change the state? http://jonno.9ch.in/weather.php
[01:50:51] <JoeSa> Any help would be much appreciated -- I just want my AJAXy stuff (which is in the click handler) to be done, but for the form to _not_ be submitted
[01:52:36] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: use e.preventDefault() or return false;
[01:53:45] <JoeSa> avinashrbhat: I'm already using "return false;" in my click handler -- I'll try use e.preventDefault() and see if there's any change I guess..
[01:54:41] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: the form is getting submitted even with the return false. right?
[01:55:02] <JoeSa> avinashrbhat: Yup, and with e.preventDefault too
[01:55:06] <didiergm> Ritzton - je ne suis pas très doué non plus, mais quand même et je ne vois pas du tout par où commencer; Essaye une autre voie
[01:55:49] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: you added e.preventDefault as the starting of the line or end of the lne?
[01:56:14] <JoeSa> I added it to the end of the click handling function
[01:56:48] <JoeSa> Putting it at the start of the function has no change of effect though
[01:56:57] <JoeSa> [Just tried in light of your comment]
[01:57:46] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: add i as the first line of the function
[01:57:56] <avinashrbhat> ok
[01:58:05] <avinashrbhat> can u share the code ?
[01:58:20] <JoeSa> Sure
[01:59:16] <JoeSa> http://pastebin.com/bXRsjaRq
[02:00:54] <JoeSa> The "$("#local_search").click();" is what's causing #local_search to submit
[02:00:59] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: use jsfiddle or jsbin for these kind of thinks next ime
[02:01:33] <avinashrbhat> (grr: there is something wrong my 't')
[02:03:16] <didiergm> JoeSa - can't you just turn your input type "submit" into an input type "button" and handle what you want all by yourself ?
[02:03:47] <JoeSa> didiergm: I'd rather not as having the submit button work for users that have Javascript turned off is super useful
[02:05:16] <didiergm> JoeSa - I hear wjhat you say but on the other hand - people w/o js turned on are more and more rare nowadays; and if you are using jQuery extensively, you won't be able to provide as much functionality. But I understand the concern
[02:06:15] <JoeSa> They are certainly more rare, but in my user base specifically, they notably exist. Plus I don't see any reason why not to support them in this case -- it's just as easy to support them due to the way I have things set up, just need to fix this one really weird jQuery issue where it isn't listening to my "return false;"
[02:08:07] <JoeSa> Does anyone even have any idea _why_ it is just straight up deciding to ignore my commands telling it to not submit?
[02:11:25] <didiergm> Joesa basically you don't want the form to submit is js is turned on. If I am correct the add a submit event to the form and return false from there
[02:12:15] <JoeSa> didiergm: Right.. I'll try that and let you know if it works I guess -- seems weird that disabling the submit button click wouldn't fix that though.
[02:12:48] <didiergm> the reason you are not cancelling, i *think* is because you are using .click() which is the same as on ('click' ....) if I understand correctly the event has already bubbled up before you have the opportunity to prevent it default;
[02:14:03] <didiergm> JoeSa if I am not 100% correct it is along those lines. Event attaching and bubbling is not completely obvious there are several ways each behaving slightly differently
[02:15:31] <avinashrbhat> didiergm: you are right
[02:16:26] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: use $(".search").submit
[02:18:06] <didiergm> avinashrbhat that what I thought, but in that case the only way I found to cancel an event is to test in the handler whether the  event.currentTarget is the same a the dom object receiving the event, if not -> I return false. This is tedious but in my experience only useful for edge cases anyway
[02:19:42] <JoeSa> Yeah, using .submit and returning false isn't working -- so what are you saying I should do to stop the submit?
[02:21:12] <icdjohnsson> JoeSa I didn't see all of it: but if you do not what to make a submit, do $(elem).submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... }
[02:21:20] <icdjohnsson> );
[02:21:57] <icdjohnsson> JoeSa here: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:21:59] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: edit this http://jsfiddle.net/Avinash_R/5HVN6/ and share it with us
[02:22:11] <JoeSa> It's still submitting -- will share
[02:24:03] <avinashrbhat> ok
[02:24:07] <JoeSa> http://jsfiddle.net/5HVN6/1/ -- Not sure how you can simulate URL paramatery using jsfiddle, but when specifying something like ?q=test, the form still submits
[02:24:16] <JoeSa> paramaters*
[02:24:21] <JoeSa> parameters*
[02:25:01] <avinashrbhat> there is a panel saying **Testing Ajax requests** look at it
[02:26:20] <JoeSa> It's still redirecting anyway -- not quite sure why since now I'm explicitly telling it not to submit the form, but it's ignoring me apparently.
[02:27:59] <JoeSa> I've gotta go anyway -- if anyone figures out what's wrong, let me know :P
[02:28:16] <icdjohnsson> JoeSa what's not working?
[02:28:34] <icdjohnsson> It's redirecting since you have the $("#local_search").click(function(e) {}) with ajax method
[02:28:42] <JoeSa> icdjohnsson: On passing a "q" url parameter, the form in question submits
[02:29:00] <JoeSa> It should AJAX but _not_ submit
[02:29:05] <JoeSa> Anyway, have to go
[02:33:56] <zeroXten> hi, I'm trying to use a jquery plugin but get method not found. so for some reason it isn't seeing $.fn.themethod ... any hints?
[02:35:29] <avinashrbhat> JoeSa: http://jsfiddle.net/Avinash_R/5HVN6/6/
[02:35:35] <avinashrbhat> finally got it working
[02:36:23] <icdjohnsson> avinashrbhat: yes, by enabling jQuery to it, it worked
[02:36:37] <zeroXten> if i run alert($.fn.jquery); just above it I get the jQuery version
[02:37:39] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten I often make the mistake when I try to include the file - spelled wrong or something
[02:37:39] <avinashrbhat> icdjohnsson: i guess that it is on me then :sheepish:
[02:39:08] <zeroXten> hmm, icdjohnsson what about my alert though.. inside the library js file?
[02:39:26] <zeroXten> this is inside a rails app, so it is very possible that i'm loading files badly etc ;)
[02:39:50] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten do you have a js-console to see if something goes wrong?
[02:41:26] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: yeah, i get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'wysiwym'
[02:41:49] <zeroXten> that is inside a different js file though, that is trying to use the plugin
[02:41:57] <zeroXten> could it be some sort of scope problem for $?
[02:42:17] <icdjohnsson> It's hard to tell what it could be without seeing the code. Could you share somehow?
[02:42:46] <zeroXten> sure
[02:43:11] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14976643/rails-3-jquery-markdown-editor-has-no-method
[02:43:15] <zeroXten> ;)
[02:43:24] <zeroXten> let me know if anything is missing
[02:43:28] <icdjohnsson> are you doing some sort of $(document).ready( ?
[02:43:39] <zeroXten> yeah
[02:44:20] <zeroXten> after all the js has been src'd
[02:45:06] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten how does this one look?
[02:45:07] <icdjohnsson> wysiwym
[02:46:00] <zeroXten> one sec
[02:46:49] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: http://jsfiddle.net/awwaZ/
[02:49:02] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten I can
[02:49:05] <icdjohnsson> oops
[02:49:21] <icdjohnsson> I can't see how an element fits into all this in those lines
[02:50:12] <zeroXten> sorry, I'm not sure I know what you mean. element?
[02:51:10] <zeroXten> $('.markdown').wysiwym(Wysiwym.Markdown);
[02:51:14] <icdjohnsson> you are using your script to target '.markdown',
[02:51:30] <zeroXten> yeah
[02:51:39] <zeroXten> which are textareas that are to be turned into markdown editors
[02:51:49] <icdjohnsson> what do you want to do with that element? What is supposed to happen? Do you have any code in the function that actually applies to an element
[02:52:35] <icdjohnsson> I see, but you havn't revealed that in what you sent me. There could be an error fruther down in your code
[02:52:56] <zeroXten> hmm, I've been trying to implement this http://pushingkarma.com/projects/jquery-wysiwym/
[02:53:33] <zeroXten> one sec, there is a better document I think for what I'm doing
[02:56:45] <zeroXten> actually, that doc seems ok
[02:56:50] <zeroXten> if you ignore the showdown stuff
[02:57:00] <icdjohnsson> where do you define Wysiwym.Markdown, that what is inside the paranthesis?
[02:57:45] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: its all provided by that plugin
[02:57:56] <zeroXten> i only gave you a snippet as its pretty long
[02:58:14] <zeroXten> I'm working on the assumption that their code is fine and my attempt to use it is broken
[02:58:32] <zeroXten> "Setting up the WYSIWYM editor is as simple as calling .wysiwym(...) on the jQuery textarea. "
[02:59:35] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: http://jsfiddle.net/awwaZ/1/ has the Markdown function included
[03:00:21] <zeroXten> i tried a different plugin and got the same error
[03:04:40] <zeroXten> i'm pretty sure its going to be something stupid
[03:05:45] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten is that all of the code? THen it's broken
[03:06:09] <icdjohnsson> What happens near line 16? "..."
[03:06:54] <icdjohnsson> and where is the last right-hand side parantheses?
[03:08:53] <zeroXten> one sec
[03:09:48] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten http://mjs7231.bitbucket.org/jquery-wysiwym/wysiwym/wysiwym.js
[03:09:51] <icdjohnsson> try that one
[03:11:36] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: http://jsfiddle.net/awwaZ/2/
[03:11:56] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: that is exactly what I'm using
[03:12:11] <zeroXten> i was just pasting bits of the code
[03:12:13] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten I got this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/awwaZ/3/
[03:12:24] <zeroXten> i doubt it is their code at fault
[03:12:25] <nickcv> hi guys
[03:12:41] <nickcv> i've got one simple question, I hope someone can help me out
[03:12:53] <nickcv> is there someway to check what bind and delegates are currently active?
[03:13:40] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: that is pretty much what I'm doing.. except for me it doesn't work
[03:13:56] <zeroXten> not being an expert in jquery I don't understand the vague error
[03:14:09] <zeroXten> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'wysiwym'
[03:14:17] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten can you change this one: <script src="/assets/wysiwym/wysiwym.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[03:14:26] <icdjohnsson> to this: <script src='http://mjs7231.bitbucket.org/jquery-wysiwym/wysiwym/wysiwym.js'></script>
[03:14:32] <zeroXten> clearly $.fn.wysiwym wasn't defined when it comes to me applying to the textarea
[03:14:44] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: one sec
[03:15:45] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten the error means that the html-element with class 'markdown' doesn't have a method named 'wysiwym' that works or is defined
[03:16:26] <zeroXten> huh, that worked.
[03:16:27] <zeroXten> on sec
[03:16:49] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten then I guess something is corrupt with your file
[03:17:06] <icdjohnsson> or also - do you know why you add the ?body=1, I mean, do you have to=
[03:17:13] <icdjohnsson> I don't know about rails so...
[03:17:52] <zeroXten> its a rails thing I think
[03:18:00] <icdjohnsson> yes it is
[03:18:01] <zeroXten> so I replaced my .js with the one you pasted
[03:18:09] <icdjohnsson> and?
[03:18:27] <zeroXten> broken again when trying to load from file system
[03:18:54] <zeroXten> fsck.. i think i see it
[03:18:55] <icdjohnsson> did you add the ?body=1, if so: don't
[03:19:06] <zeroXten> no i didn't, rails does that in its asset pipeline
[03:20:02] <icdjohnsson> when you tried with the outbound link I gave you, did you put it in so it loads the js-files in different order?
[03:21:55] <icdjohnsson> zeroXten what is it that you see?
[03:22:00] <zeroXten> icdjohnsson: yup.. it seems to be the application.js that is breaking things. seems to be reinitializing jquery or something
[03:22:06] <zeroXten> so i lose everything defined
[03:22:21] <icdjohnsson> Ok well there you go :)
[03:22:30] <zeroXten> very much in a rails problem now
[03:22:39] <zeroXten> still me doing something stupid i'm sure
[03:22:49] <zeroXten> but todo with rails not jquery itself
[03:22:53] <icdjohnsson> yes, can't help you there though
[03:22:57] <zeroXten> thanks very much for your help :)
[03:23:05] <icdjohnsson> you're welcome
[03:26:18] <derik> what event are when you finish to type on a text field and go to another ?
[03:29:59] <icdjohnsson> derik 'keyup'?
[03:30:11] <icdjohnsson> derik no sorry, now I get it
[03:31:01] <derik> icdjohnsson keyup is when pres a key, i whant when i finish to write a word or phrase
[03:31:36] <icdjohnsson> derik perhaps the focus event?
[03:31:52] <icdjohnsson> derik: or even focusout
[03:34:11] <derik> i think work with change()
[03:36:12] <icdjohnsson> derik change will trigger whenever things change. I think. Tell me what worked.
[03:36:51] <derik> icdjohnsson yes, will work with change()
[03:37:49] <icdjohnsson> Nice
[03:41:27] <gotwig> hez
[03:41:57] <gotwig> what is the easiest way to limit the charackters in a contenteditable p tag?
[03:43:25] <gotwig> seems far too much http://onwebdev.blogspot.com/2011/03/jquery-twitter-with-html5.html
[03:44:03] <gotwig> I used to use a return statement for the p tag
[03:44:14] <gotwig> but it doesnt work in firefox :(?
[03:44:29] <gotwig> http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/
[03:55:52] <gotwig> n idea_
[04:00:06] <twovs>  no body talking anything?
[04:00:15] <gotwig> yeah... sad
[04:00:19] <gotwig> I asked something
[04:00:30] <gotwig> somehow firefox does use contenteditable different then chrome
[04:00:43] <gotwig> firefox creates a new div, when you enter text
[04:01:49] <gotwig> I use onkeypress="return (this.innerText.length <= 60)" to limit the amount of charachters
[04:01:57] <gotwig> why does firefox ignore it?
[04:03:48] <twovs> gotwig  i dont know
[04:09:01] <gotwig> very bad, I just use text()
[04:09:29] <gotwig> can you believe it, not even such stuff is standardiyed. I just read that innerText is indeed a function from microsoft
[04:09:36] <gotwig> *standardized
[04:12:25] * gotwig join #html5
[04:24:14] <noregret> if i want to post a form in ajax, do I need a plugin for that ?
[04:35:32] <icdjohnsson> noregret no just use $.post or $.ajax with a $('form').submit(function (e) { e.preventDefault() $.post/$.ajax });
[04:43:25] <thinkerweb> does the jquery website use wordpress?
[04:43:56] <icdjohnsson> thinkerweb it seems as it does for me
[04:45:03] <thinkerweb> wierd, you'd think they'd just use they own technologies
[04:46:33] <icdjohnsson> jQuery is a front end enviorment - wordpress is the underlying back end architecture. I think it's totally fair :)
[04:47:31] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, I guess so, but wish they had their own solution or any mention of using their technology with wordpress
[04:47:42] <icdjohnsson> I guess they use it it speeds up the documentation and get good version history of things.
[04:48:53] <icdjohnsson> Well - I am not a wordpress user myself - but I think there are many wordpress directed plugins for jQuery and vice versa.
[04:49:45] <icdjohnsson> They do mention it in the "contribute"-section: http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[04:50:42] <icdjohnsson> thinkerweb look under "WordPress and jquery-wp-content"
[04:59:22] <thinkerweb> yeah wordpress is awesome, I gotta learn in one day.
[04:59:55] <thinkerweb> You know how there is the sortable lists for jquery ui, how do you make your sorting persistent, and what is the use otherwise
[05:01:57] <icdjohnsson> thinkerweb language barrier for me. What do you mean by persistent in this case?
[05:02:19] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, make the changes permanent, so it hardcoded
[05:03:20] <thinkerweb> how can I read in element into the list and then save the new ordering so when I reload, it reads in the new order
[05:03:48] <icdjohnsson> thinkerweb I think you are misunderstanding something about the concet for javascript/front end scripting
[05:04:06] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, I understanding some other technologies are required.
[05:04:28] <icdjohnsson> when the end user gets the content, the line is cut and the server does no longer care what the end user does with that content
[05:04:54] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, yes, I see, thanks for your help
[05:05:19] <icdjohnsson> what you want is something that - when you make a change - you trigger an event which sends data to the server so the server can store the new state
[05:06:37] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, yep, but lets first start with populated the list from a database
[05:06:46] <icdjohnsson> this could be achieved in your very exmaple by sending data with an ajax call in the sortables callback-function
[05:07:38] <basiclaser> query wizards, solve this conundrum if you dare http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/
[05:08:05] <icdjohnsson> thinkerweb exactly. Then when changed, send the new sorting with an ajax-call to, for instance, a php-file, which processes that information and inserts it into the database
[05:08:33] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, thx
[05:08:39] <basiclaser> the 2nd and 3rd div's do not accept values , only the first div does, and then the 2nd and 3rd div's copy the value of the first box :s how would i make it so that they all accept different values individually ? http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/
[05:10:56] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser
[05:10:56] <icdjohnsson> http://jsfiddle.net/EsFGZ/17/
[05:11:10] <icdjohnsson> you are not allowed to define an ID several times
[05:11:18] <icdjohnsson> that's the thing with ID, it's unique
[05:11:46] <icdjohnsson> instead, go by that forms input, and select with a class $('.inp') as in the updated link
[05:11:47] <thinkerweb> id's unique is 101
[05:11:55] <thinkerweb> css 101
[05:12:03] <basiclaser> my ID's were 1 2 3
[05:12:10] <basiclaser> oh i think i see what you mean
[05:12:13] <icdjohnsson> no, you had #inp
[05:12:19] <basiclaser> yeh :D
[05:12:21] <basiclaser> my bad
[05:12:26] <basiclaser> thanks for pointing it out
[05:12:29] <icdjohnsson> also, basiclaser, make sure to change the id #change
[05:12:33] <icdjohnsson> it's defined three times
[05:12:41] <thinkerweb> icdjohnsson, what you talking about, he know about unique id's ofcourse
[05:13:00] <thinkerweb> 3x? woow
[05:13:13] <icdjohnsson> Still, you should also tell why something went wrong, not just give the correct answer. Anyway, that is my opinion.
[05:13:21] <basiclaser> i can understand something in theory and then not see it when i write and read code :P
[05:13:27] <basiclaser> i make mistakes like that all the time
[05:13:37] <icdjohnsson> I do not sit here and help people believing that everyone knows these things. I sit here because I believe people need help because they don't know.
[05:13:42] <thinkerweb> basiclaser, you will remember now after icdjohnsson reminded you
[05:13:50] <basiclaser> yes :P
[05:13:53] <icdjohnsson> Yes :)
[05:15:24] <basiclaser> hey johnson, you know that code, which query source should i link in to use it? just the latest core jqeury?
[05:16:50] <icdjohnsson> yes. Keep to the latest stable jQuery
[05:17:06] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser also, why not include the jQuery UI, it's powerful once you get to learn it.
[05:17:32] <basiclaser> ok :) does it have nice button and range presets?
[05:18:17] <anonymous_> how to change color of button  on click?
[05:19:02] <scone> hey does anyone know why I'd be getting a URL like etc.com/[object%20Object] from a $.post()?
[05:20:24] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser I am sorry - I do not use the style presets myself. I code various design myself actually. I do it by
[05:20:35] <icdjohnsson> wait, on the phone...
[05:20:43] <basiclaser> np!
[05:21:38] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ would you like to change the color of the same button you click?
[05:22:47] <anonymous_> icdjohnsson: yeah.exactly

[05:24:39] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ to change background-color on a real button might not be cross browser compatible, that's why I used a div instead
[05:25:01] <anonymous_> ty.. I need this only.
[05:25:03] <icdjohnsson> scone can you view anything from the code?
[05:25:23] <scone> actually it "fixed itself" afte ra browser reset :)
[05:25:25] <anonymous_> I will  try in my project and let yu know.
[05:25:47] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser as I was saying - I do my own layout with help from the js-console in chrome. jQuery UI often adds elements, I check which and their classes/ids and set them myself
[05:26:04] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser I would be a good idea to use the standard preset css-files and modify them though
[05:26:15] <anonymous_> icdjonhsson: I can have any number of buttons. right?
[05:26:42] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ yes, but if you are going to use the same code several times, make sure you do not use the id="button"
[05:26:46] <anonymous_> such tht  which button is click tht button only changes color
[05:26:55] <icdjohnsson> becuase as said earlier, you are not allowed to define the same ID several times
[05:27:23] <icdjohnsson> make it a class instead, class='button' and target it with ".button" instead of "#button" from the javscript
[05:27:35] <anonymous_> so, i iwll create another div for next button
[05:27:48] <anonymous_> ohkay ..
[05:27:51] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ yes, only that button will change colors, because we used the keyword "this" which implies it's the very button you clicked to trigger the event
[05:27:53] <anonymous_> so one class is enuf?
[05:28:05] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ yes, exactly
[05:28:11] <anonymous_> ty..!!
[05:28:30] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: thanks, by that do you mean the ones which automatically appear when you insert form/input elements
[05:30:29] <djQuery> morning
[05:30:42] <laga> hello all. JQuery Mobile is listed as 24kb minified + gzipped. compressing with gzip -9 gives me about 40kb - am I doing it wrong?
[05:30:49] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser yes, the jQuery UI inserts elements such as close-buttons and small arrows to better show what you can do with certain elements
[05:31:19] <derik> how to make an event when 3 input fields are not empty?
[05:31:34] <icdjohnsson> laga this is actually not a question for jquery channel(?)
[05:32:27] <laga> icdjohnsson: the question actually was: is the 24kb figure stated on the website correct? :) or is there a specific JQM channel?
[05:32:44] <icdjohnsson> derik, you can listen for those three elements and check .innerHTML, or .html for length
[05:34:13] <icdjohnsson> laga oh sorry, yes, seems to be wrong. Downloaded jQuery.mobile.min I get 144KB
[05:35:01] <icdjohnsson> Or maybe they mean that when they gzip the file they get it to be 24KB
[05:35:01] <anonymous_> icdjohnsson:check diz: http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/5/
[05:35:24] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ yes, what is the error?
[05:35:28] <anonymous_> red color sud apper on current button .
[05:35:49] <icdjohnsson> It does for me?
[05:36:04] <anonymous_> suppose, if  i lcick locations buttons, den property button get changed into green color.
[05:36:17] <icdjohnsson> What browser do you use?
[05:36:32] <anonymous_> oh! is it?I use gc..
[05:36:45] <icdjohnsson> Also - did you try to refresh the site again?
[05:37:05] <icdjohnsson> I do not know about gc. Are you referring to a gecko-browser?
[05:37:06] <anonymous_> i jst tried in jsfiddle.
[05:37:16] <anonymous_> I mean, google chrome
[05:37:18] <djQuery> anonymous_, or this even http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/6/
[05:37:31] <icdjohnsson> Works like a charm for me in that fiddle anonymous_
[05:38:00] <anonymous_> djquery: not  so .
[05:38:11] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_, what djQuery did is actually better. Later on you can set up rules for the class selected.
[05:38:11] <anonymous_> icdjohnsoon: den y nt for me..
[05:38:51] <anonymous_> button sud b highlighted with red color when i click tht ..
[05:38:56] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ try the link djQuery gave you: http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/6/
[05:39:19] <laga> icdjohnsson: thanks
[05:39:50] <djQuery> anonymous_, I came into this kinda late so don't know what you are trying to accomplish with this
[05:39:54] <anonymous_> let me give  u example site for reference
[05:40:31] <anonymous_> hhhtp://www.fiestahomes.in/property.html
[05:40:54] <anonymous_> http://www.fiestahomes.in/property.html
[05:41:18] <anonymous_> same as in tht site
[05:41:46] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ is it a button or a link you want to change? You need to show more of your code.
[05:41:54] <anonymous_> when u click think design , changes to orange color and property  has no color
[05:42:08] <icdjohnsson> If you change site in between - the modifies background-color wont apply to the new site loaded
[05:42:39] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ it's different sites. When you click the button - the URL changes
[05:42:42] <djQuery> anonymous_, so when you click a button that button is the only one that can be selected
[05:42:45] <djQuery> easy
[05:43:12] <icdjohnsson> I see.
[05:43:23] <anonymous_> djquery: yup!
[05:44:04] <djQuery> $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){ $(this).toggleClass('selected').siblings('.selected').removeClass('selected'); do stuff to change the image});
[05:44:11] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: hey man can i get your help with these boxes again? i've been struggling with the constant problem of code working fine in jsfiddle, but the second i put them into a barebones site structure, they do nothing in my browser
[05:44:41] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/12/
[05:44:55] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser which boxes?
[05:45:09] <basiclaser> i will fiddle it again one sec!
[05:45:32] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/
[05:45:44] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/
[05:46:00] <anonymous_> icdjohnsson: exactlyy!! tyy soo much!!
[05:46:09] <basiclaser> i port all that code into files and try to load in browser and i get nothing..
[05:46:35] <anonymous_> djquery: ty so much  u too!!
[05:46:52] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser does the fiddle work as expected?
[05:47:13] <icdjohnsson> people - I need to leave after this becuase I got visited - so I am just helping basiclaser now
[05:47:44] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: yes perfectly, the primary function is functioning, here is the exact code from the html css an djs documents http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/24/
[05:47:47] <anonymous_> icdjohnsson : when will u bac again?
[05:48:06] <djQuery> anonymous_, this is easier and faster. http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/13/
[05:48:57] <anonymous_> think its nt expected one .
[05:49:01] <djQuery> anonymous_, oops this is fixed http://jsfiddle.net/zQzgX/14/
[05:49:01] <anonymous_> @djquery
[05:49:10] <anonymous_> ok
[05:49:51] <anonymous_> yup! ..
[05:50:06] <icdjohnsson> anonymous_ I don't know. But this is my nickname anyway or perhaps ic_johnsson so
[05:50:32] <icdjohnsson> so basiclaser it does not work when you move the code to your local machine?
[05:50:45] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser did you include all the js-files properly?
[05:51:00] <anonymous_> @icdjohnsson:ok.
[05:51:15] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson an exact copy of the functioning jsfiddle
[05:51:33] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser if you have google chrome, you can right click in the wherever on the page and chose "javascript console"
[05:51:48] <icdjohnsson> see if you can find something useful in the console
[05:52:09] <djQuery> basiclaser, have you used the dev tools of your browser to make sure that all your links are correct
[05:52:21] <djQuery> ie pulling in jquery correctly
[05:52:51] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: ok ill look up a tut to see how to use the debugging stuff
[05:53:24] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser it's easy. "Inspect element" is the menu-item you should click when you rightclick, to bring up the console
[05:53:27] <djQuery> basiclaser, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[05:54:12] <basiclaser> djQuery: thanks for that!
[05:54:21] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: i see it now yeh ,
[05:54:50] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson:  i will read through everything and see if its all linked
[05:55:26] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser I need to go. djQuery seems to be your guardian angel though. Good luck man
[05:55:31] <icdjohnsson> and yes, good :)
[05:55:41] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson:  thanks i really appreciate your help !!
[05:55:50] <basiclaser> icdjohnsson: you've given me hope :D
[05:56:26] <icdjohnsson> basiclaser: here is exactly what I mean
[05:56:27] <icdjohnsson> http://ajwebdesigner.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/javascript_chrome-console.jpg
[05:56:35] <icdjohnsson> use that console to debug whatever fails
[05:56:46] <icdjohnsson> Ok
[05:56:49] <icdjohnsson> Bye
[06:01:51] <basiclaser> djQuery: hey buddy what does it mean if '$ is not defined'?
[06:02:05] <djQuery> means that jquery didnt load
[06:02:10] <basiclaser> ohhh
[06:02:23] <djQuery> check your script tags
[06:02:26] <basiclaser> i was using the 'latest' src, does that work?
[06:03:10] <djQuery> right click inspect element expand the head ( or wherever yo uhave that script tag) click on it
[06:03:16] <djQuery> does it find it?
[06:04:57] <basiclaser> i inserted the external jquery link into my browser, and it said 'could not find', so maybe its dead?
[06:05:40] <djQuery> i allways use the google cdn one myself
[06:05:59] <basiclaser> aha it works now!
[06:06:08] <basiclaser> i think i was using some dead query links
[06:06:28] <anonymous_> djquery: I would like to use the code u provided on click button images instead of divs
[06:06:42] <djQuery> anonymous_, so.....
[06:07:15] <anonymous_> jst  i sud add class for all a links.. righT?
[06:07:39] <djQuery> sure
[06:08:23] <basiclaser> djQuery: thanks for your helps :)

[06:09:39] <djQuery> bored and realy don't want to get around to writing this wordpress plugin
[06:13:04] <derik> i have $("#id").keyup(); who i add #id2 simultan ?
[06:13:28] <anonymous_> djquery: can we make divs as targets to display some content?
[06:13:32] <djQuery> $(#id, #id2)
[06:13:41] <derik> with coma
[06:13:52] <derik> i try without coma and dosent work
[06:14:43] <djQuery> derik, how would you target 2 items in css? same way as a jquery selector
[06:15:04] <derik> thanks djQuery
[06:15:14] <djQuery> anonymous_, have you looked at ui.tabs?
[06:15:15] <derik> djQuery when i must put "" ?
[06:15:39] <anonymous_> @djquery:nope!
[06:16:37] <djQuery> anonymous_, http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#vertical
[06:17:36] <djQuery> derik, $('#id1, $id2, .whatverselector').on('keyup', function(){});

[06:23:25] <HardFu> I have a table, with on('click') handler for each row
[06:23:40] <HardFu> but when I insert new row
[06:24:01] <HardFu> handler isn't triggered
[06:24:10] <HardFu> I insert it with javascript
[06:24:21] <djQuery> HardFu, how did you write the on?
[06:24:22] <HardFu> $('.list tr td:not(:first-child)').on('click', function(e) {
[06:25:01] <djQuery> HardFu, that wont work
[06:25:25] <HardFu> why not
[06:25:41] <djQuery> $('tbody').on('click', '.list tr td:not(:first-child)', function(){});
[06:26:04] <djQuery> HardFu, that is more like doing $('.list tr td:not(:first-child)').click(funciton

[06:26:43] <HardFu> djQuery
[06:27:22] <djQuery> HardFu, but do u understand and can extrapolate the fix from what I wrote?
[06:27:41] <HardFu> I think so yes
[06:28:04] <refu> **I want iterate two lists, one inside other, how I can get element of superior list that I am iterator. If I have $(this), it referer two second iterator
[06:28:10] <refu> :/
[06:28:39] <djQuery> HardFu, .on('click', fun) they have to exist at load. .on('click', selector, fun) they can be created later
[06:28:53] <HardFu> excellent, it works now

[08:29:32] <eindoofus> when declaring variables in JavaScript is it better to use a name like: image_path, imagePath, or ImagePath ?
[08:29:55] <quantax-> its more important to be consistent
[08:30:11] <quantax-> go with what you find most readable

[08:38:25] <arl> I've got a real quick question: why does the page display (and update) _after_ the loop has run? http://jsbin.com/edigog/2/edit
[08:39:37] <carpii> put the loop in a $(document).ready( { function() {
[08:39:42] <carpii> put the loop in a $(document).ready( function() {
[08:40:09] <avinashrbhat> arl: simple, because you are doing so.
[08:40:11] <carpii> else it just executes as soon as its encountered in the response
[08:41:27] <avinashrbhat> note from node.js "everything except your code runs in concurrently"
[08:43:22] <josefrichter> : anyone working with jqtouch please? I need a list filter like this one in jqm http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/docs/widgets/listviews#list-filter ideas?
[08:46:01] <arl> carpii: like this: http://jsbin.com/edigog/7/edit ? It doesn't seem to work
[08:46:59] <arl> avinashrbhat: I thought that a browser executed the source sequentially, thus after the <div> had already been rendered
[08:48:23] <avinashrbhat> yes, that is exactly is said there, in the other way
[08:49:43] <avinashrbhat> but the rendering will not be done after completing the script, because it is embedded in it,\
[08:50:03] <avinashrbhat> so your loop will complete before the rendering
[08:50:06] <avinashrbhat> got it?
[08:50:12] <arl> but the div should be rendered, and then jquery should update it as the loop proceeds, no?
[08:50:29] <arl> oh
[08:50:58] <hugo_moss> damn memory leaks in illustrator
[08:51:06] <arl> so the browser remains in the loop and doesn't exit (and thus update loop) until its complete?
[08:53:12] <avinashrbhat> yup
[08:54:57] <carpii> arl: http://jsfiddle.net/4KYUV/
[08:56:58] <carpii> heres a better one http://jsfiddle.net/4KYUV/2/
[08:59:49] <arl> carpii: much appreciated. That should be really helpful in understanding

[09:27:03] <Gho5t> var sRadius should only appear once
[09:27:39] <ideaprison> youre right, I usually dont do that
[09:27:44] <ideaprison> well only once
[09:28:43] <ideaprison> that fixed it

[11:27:38] <josefrichter> hi, I am filtering a list as-you-type by iterating over all <li>, checking whether their content matches, and then hiding them if not. see code here http://pastie.org/6323507 but it is very inefficient and super-slow, especially on mobile. can anyone recommend a better approach please?
[11:28:41] <hooloovoo> josefrichter: you should read the list first and then iterate over a data representation
[11:29:01] <hooloovoo> and hide when you get a match. it's probably kinda slow no matter how you do it
[11:29:27] <joshsmith> josefrichter: why don't you use contains?
[11:29:42] <joshsmith> I'm not sure what the point of matching the html itself is
[11:29:51] <josefrichter> hooloovoo you mean reading the list into some array?
[11:29:51] <joshsmith> if it's "as-you-type" as you say
[11:29:56] <discorpia> ul#cities_list > li   is probably more efficient (if that's enough for you)
[11:30:12] <josefrichter> joshsmiths what you mean?
[11:30:26] <joshsmith> josefrichter: one sec
[11:30:30] <discorpia> joshsmith: but also do a var $city_li = $('ul#cities_list > li');   and then use $city_li, so you don't need to search twice
[11:30:36] <josefrichter> discorpia yes, but probably not enough :-(
[11:30:45] <hooloovoo> josefrichter: yes do something like $("li").each(function() { data_list.push({ element: $(this), value: $(this).html() }) })
[11:30:48] <hooloovoo> then iterate over that
[11:31:05] <hooloovoo> and hide/show the element using the stored element in the array
[11:32:01] <joshsmith> josefrichter: this is what I do for finding in a list https://gist.github.com/JoshSmith/ad48282c05abfd23cd25
[11:32:16] <josefrichter> hooloovoo and how do I do the hiding part?
[11:32:29] <joshsmith> there are optimizations that can be made for sure, but that contains works well for case-insensitive filtering
[11:33:53] <hooloovoo> josefrichter: i'd do like $("input").on("change", function() { for(var i = 0, il = data_list.length; i < il; i++){ if(stuff mathes) { data_list[i].element.show() } } })
[11:35:22] <josefrichter> joshsmith I don't need case sensitive. so the main thing there is this "contains" stuff?
[11:36:06] <joshsmith> josefrichter: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:41:01] <josefrichter> joshsmith ok, I'm on zepto though :-)
[11:41:16] <josefrichter> hooloovoo will try that, thanks

[11:57:41] <w1pko> coaster: $('#newlyLoadedElement').load(function() { alert('exists'); });
[11:58:40] <shoky> w1pko: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[11:59:12] <w1pko> shoky: thanks
[11:59:56] <coaster> i just created a function to check if the element exists every x milliseconds
[12:00:06] <coaster> and if so do action, seems to work
[12:17:09] <LindsayMac> Hello guys.. Does anyone have some reading materials or direction to turn me towards in my attempts at doing an automatic "copy to clipboard" link without the use of flash?
[12:20:14] <shoky> LindsayMac: dont think that's possible
[12:20:47] <LindsayMac> blerg.. i see the "feature" everywhere and assumed that there was maybe a way to do it with modern browsers more easily
[12:21:12] <shoky> do you see the feature when you have flash turned off? :]
[12:21:20] <shoky> as in, does it work ;p
[12:21:40] <LindsayMac> I haven't actually tried.. i was just making assumptions on how popular it is
[12:21:50] <LindsayMac> and how much people are turned OFF by flash
[12:21:58] <LindsayMac> and that maybe my googling was missing something
[12:22:07] <shoky> i'm as turned off by flash as i am of a website touching my clipboard..
[12:22:41] <LindsayMac> I guess i'll probably just forgo the "feature" ... I really don't NEED it and that's such a messy work around
[12:23:00] <dersand> Could someone please explain to me how function arguments works?
[12:23:44] <shoky> dersand: got a more specific question?
[12:24:22] <dersand> not really, i just want to know how they work because i do not understand it.
[12:26:17] <shoky> you pass them in when calling a function, their values are copied into the actual arguments that you use inside the function
[12:26:52] <shoky> (and by value of an object or array, i just mean a reference)
[12:27:15] <dersand> could you give an example?
[12:28:21] <shoky> js> function f(a,b,c) { print(a, b, c); }    f('hey', 42, [1,2,3])
[12:28:24] <b-ot> shoky: hey 42 1,2,3
[12:28:50] <shoky> js> function f(a,b,c) { print(c, b, a); }    f('hey', 42, [1,2,3])
[12:28:52] <b-ot> shoky: 1,2,3 42 hey
[12:31:55] <dersand> so first of you are defining a,b and c?
[12:32:48] <jrajav> dersand: They are defined along with the function itself. They will be filled with the passed arguments when the function is called, and available as local variables inside the function.
[12:32:49] <shoky> defining a function f that expects to be called with 3 arguments. inside f, those arguments are named a, b, c
[12:56:15] <raj> print is a thing?
[13:02:16] <Tomashe> Hey guys, i noticed some issue. when im post using jquery into php file it sometimes it doesnt recognize some "includes" and it takes him time to recognize it
[13:02:50] <Tomashe> i mean i have a php file with include "../class.php" it gives me 500 internal error , like this files itn there and it is there.
[13:03:03] <Tomashe> i really like to know if there anything to do agains that
[13:10:04] <raj> Tomashe, make sure the file path is correct
[13:11:32] <Tomashe> it is :/
[13:12:58] <Tomashe> i even change it few times to all possibles paths
[13:12:59] <Tomashe> :/
[13:15:59] <shoky> js> print(print)
[13:16:02] <b-ot> shoky: function print() {     [native code] }
[13:19:27] <darkfrog> hey guys, I'm using the autocomplete in jQuery UI and for some reason change events don't fire for the input upon blurring the field if the value was changed by the autocomplete....can someone tell me why or how to fix this?
[13:19:32] <Tomashe> what?
[13:43:57] <basiclaser> any of you guys use sublime text 2?
[13:44:10] <didiergm> yes
[13:44:48] <carpii> yup
[13:46:07] <dersand> i  dont know the right termology but how do i pass an html value into an argument
[13:46:35] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser yup, my editor of choice regardless of platform now
[13:46:39] <dersand> like function(a) and $("#btn").val() = a
[13:48:23] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: I've installed the package manager, could you tell me how to download and install jslint plugin? https://github.com/fbzhong/sublime-jslint I've never gotten on with consoles very well :P
[13:48:30] <carpii> dersand, youre not makin much sense
[13:49:34] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser so you have the package manager, you should be able to just go to Install Package in the Package Manager Install Package menu
[13:50:10] <dersand> i want the parameter a in function(a) to display the html value of a button.
[13:50:48] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: cool i found jslint,
[13:51:24] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: its a text file, how do i integrate it?
[13:51:25] <basiclaser> :P
[13:51:27] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser yup, package manager should make it easier.  Love the lint integration, although it does tend to hang once in a while for a few seconds (5-10)
[13:51:36] <Es0teric> anyone here used jquery + coffeescript for syntax purposes?
[13:52:37] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser in the dropdown menu where you found JSLint (in the package manager install package dropdown), you should just have to click on the package to install
[13:53:02] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser it'll display a message in a text file, but it should be installed automatically
[13:53:49] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser I like SublimeHinter btw, as opposed to the specific JSLint
[13:53:51] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: the package manager for me is just the osx 'finder' window..
[13:54:15] <basiclaser> would you recommend it over jslint? :)
[13:54:32] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser 0o ... yah, you need to run the installation command for the sublime package manager
[13:54:45] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation
[13:56:21] <basiclaser> wow i really have no idea what I'm doing haha ^ ^
[13:57:26] <Teduardo> Hey; does anyone here use validationEngine much?
[13:57:50] <Teduardo> its super easy to use; but sometimes it just doesn't work
[13:58:02] <Teduardo> and I have no idea to figure out why it sometimes doesnt work
[13:58:07] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser in Sublime Text - type cntl-` to open the console
[13:58:09] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: oh i was using the console and not the palette :P my bad
[13:58:16] <basiclaser> oh :D
[13:58:26] <basiclaser> wtf ha
[13:58:42] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser then copy the installation command into the command line
[13:58:54] <basiclaser> i did it :P
[13:58:56] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser still inside sublime text
[13:58:58] <LocalPCGuy> ok
[13:59:13] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser then look under preferences
[13:59:21] <LocalPCGuy> should see package control
[13:59:51] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: i do
[14:00:42] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser you should be able to use that to install the lint tool you prefer
[14:01:05] <LocalPCGuy> I like CSSLint and SublimeLinter (after a bit of customization to remove some of the more draconian rules)
[14:01:50] <Teduardo> is there any way using firebug or chrome console to figure out why validationengine isn't firing on submit?
[14:02:50] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: ooh file templates sounds good :3
[14:02:56] <basiclaser> some good plugins
[14:03:17] <beachandbytes> Teduardo, ya, do you have some code to show
[14:04:01] <Teduardo> sure but i dont think validationengine works on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/XvC8B/
[14:04:28] <basiclaser> do you guys use normalize.css?
[14:06:03] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser I think I generally have 6-7 plugins installed, some I rarely use (one to add printing, color switcher, prefixr)
[14:06:33] <LocalPCGuy> I use a merged version of the old reset.css and normalize.css
[14:07:16] <basiclaser> i liked the sound of print2pdf, can see that being pretty useful
[14:07:18] <LocalPCGuy> some things I don't agree with the choices in normalize, so we merged the reset with some basics from normalize
[14:07:19] <beachandbytes> Teduardo your input elements need id
[14:07:48] <basiclaser> whoops
[14:08:36] <Teduardo> beachandbytes: okay so I added that to the jsfiddle and it still doesnt work; should it work there or should I abandon that ever working?
[14:09:05] <basiclaser> but yeh I'm loving sublime text 2 more every minute i use it :)
[14:11:36] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: i have open files window on the left, is it possible to switch that to a local directory nav?
[14:13:15] <xenaxon> how to draw a rectangle in Canvas?
[14:13:19] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser if you drag a folder into the sidebar you can uncheck "show open files"
[14:13:32] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser (or you can leave open files if you have tabs off)
[14:13:50] <beachandbytes> Teduardo im not sure if validation engine works on jsfiddle
[14:13:57] <beachandbytes> I would assume it does if it is only client side
[14:14:19] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: ah beautiful! thanks so much for your help getting this set up, its a dream !
[14:14:39] <carpii> xen, strokeRect ?
[14:15:29] <LocalPCGuy> basiclaser sure.  there are more commands under the Project menu for managing the folders that open (ie. you can save a project "set" of folders and open/close those, etc.)  I generally just drag a folder in while I'm working on it
[14:16:28] <basiclaser> mm yeh i think ill stick with just the local folder system, don't want to start setting up new filters and groupings everywhere
[14:19:40] <beachandbytes> Teduardo i think its not working on jsfiddle because your using jquery 1.9.1 which got rid of live
[14:20:01] <beachandbytes> switching to 1.7 and adding ids
[14:20:01] <beachandbytes> works
[14:24:49] <basiclaser> i have a <form> element of type 'input'. Is there any way to stop the page submitting and refreshing when i push enter in the 'input' field?
[14:26:36] <jrockjiggz> preventDefault()
[14:27:36] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net/92WJT/
[14:28:13] <basiclaser> mr jrock to the rescue again 8-)
[14:28:33] <basiclaser> OH so thats what prevent default is for?
[14:29:05] <LocalPCGuy> preventDefault is for prevent the default action for any event
[14:29:13] <LocalPCGuy> links, forms, etc
[14:29:39] <basiclaser> my code reads - $(document).ready(function(event){
[14:29:39] <basiclaser> $('form').on("input", function (event) {
[14:29:40] <basiclaser>     event.preventDefault();
[14:29:45] <basiclaser> (sorry for spam)
[14:29:58] <basiclaser> So it be preserved :/
[14:30:14] <jrockjiggz> 'input' is not an event
[14:30:28] <LocalPCGuy> the event for a form is submit
[14:30:36] <jrockjiggz> $('form').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[14:30:48] <jrockjiggz> as long as <input> is inside form, pressing enter submits the form
[14:30:57] <jrockjiggz> so you bind the submit event.
[14:31:00] <LocalPCGuy> you'll still need to then trigger the form manually once the submit button itself is clicked
[14:31:26] <LocalPCGuy> since stopping the submit event doesn't care how the submit was triggered
[14:32:06] <jrockjiggz> you can bind a click to submit by: $('#button').on('click', function(){ $('form').submit(); });
[14:34:10] <basiclaser> ah yeh , i want to avoid a button
[14:34:19] <basiclaser> i am just mulling over what you have both written
[14:38:28] <basiclaser>  ohh and how do i 'swap' two variable contents, I have just written current value= previous value, previous value=current value but i see thats not going to work :P
[14:39:01] <basiclaser> i suppose i could use a third var to hold a value temporarily
[14:39:17] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: jquery supports 23 kinds of events. divided by Form Events, Keyboard Events, Mouse Events
[14:39:49] <basiclaser> jrockjiggz:  just looking at this now, what a cool site http://overapi.com/jquery/
[14:40:49] <jrockjiggz> nice
[14:42:08] <Lianzinho> is there any method like fadeOut which does not set display: none ? I wish just to make it invisible but still mantain it's position
[14:42:28] <basiclaser> fadeTo()
[14:42:39] <basiclaser> then set the value to 0 or 0.1
[14:43:42] <jrockjiggz> .animate({ opacity: 0 })
[14:43:43] <jrockjiggz> or
[14:43:58] <jrockjiggz> fadeTo(100,0.1)
[14:44:35] <LocalPCGuy> only caveat with fadeTo is if you need oldIE support (7/8) they don't support opacity
[14:44:55] <LocalPCGuy> unless jQuery handles that with the filter?
[14:45:44] <basiclaser> thats what jQuery is for right? making life easy :) what do i know though :P
[14:46:55] <LocalPCGuy> yah, doesn't look like it doesn't anything special for ie
[14:47:04] <Lianzinho> well I'm assuming that to revert that I'll have to use fadeTo again, because fadeIn won't work, is that true?
[14:47:27] <LocalPCGuy> yah, you can pass 0 and 1 respectively
[14:49:28] <jrockjiggz> if old IE doesnt want to fade, i wouldn't make it priority
[14:49:39] <phonebook_> jquery can i get your opinion about a non jquery topic? the other day i looked up every planet in the solar system. www.earth.com, www.mars.com, .info, .edu. im already far beyond fed up with capatilism so maybe this pissed me off more than normal. anyway the full list is here in this 8mb picture. http://i.troll.ws/0249330a.png
[14:49:51] <phonebook_> i was just wondering if anyone gives a fuck about that kind of thing at all
[14:50:45] <basiclaser> thanks troll
[14:50:52] <LocalPCGuy> meh, good on someone for thinking of that
[14:51:03] <LocalPCGuy> (not clicking the link though, nice try)
[14:52:31] <jrajav> The link's just a normal image lol
[14:52:53] <jrajav> But I don't see what the hell a few spammy websites has to do with capitalism
[14:54:55] <phonebook_> a human that wants to learn about mars should be able to go to www.mars.com or at least www.mars.edu
[14:55:16] <LocalPCGuy> or they can do like most people do and just go to Google
[14:55:19] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[14:55:29] <phonebook_> completely tragically misses the point
[14:55:38] <phonebook_> im not going to argue
[14:55:50] <LocalPCGuy> you are not making a very good point IMO
[14:56:10] <beachandbytes> phonebook_ wiki mars
[14:56:17] <beachandbytes> wiki earth
[14:56:19] <beachandbytes> ....
[14:56:29] <beachandbytes> why do we need a different site for each one
[14:56:42] <jrajav> People that want to learn about the biological properties of apples should be able to visit apple.com :<
[14:57:12] <jrajav> Despite the fact that the .com suffix denotes commercial properties
[14:57:25] <jrajav> And the .edu suffix denotes educational properties and not educational subjects
[14:57:47] <jrajav> And that URIs are meant to refer to entities' domains and not actual keywords or subjects at all.
[14:57:53] <basiclaser> yeh i don't think you're going to get URLs to be dedicated to educational sites anytime soon, that's not the primary purpose of the internet
[14:58:11] <jrajav> Fun argument though
[14:58:21] <jrajav> 10/10 would be pedantic again
[14:58:33] <LocalPCGuy> take $200k and apply for a URI that is for educational sites only, and then if granted you can control who owns the domains and what they are used for
[14:59:13] <Lianzinho> LocalPCGuy: so how could I load the HTML and fade it back in? If I use just .html() it will just appear instantly...
[14:59:39] <LocalPCGuy> lianzinho you'd want to add the HTML to an element that already has opacity 0
[14:59:51] <LocalPCGuy> or set the opacity before you append it to the page
[15:00:35] <basiclaser> (document).hide().fadeIn(1) i think
[15:00:38] <LocalPCGuy> $('#container').css('opacity', 0).html('<stuff></stuff>')
[15:00:49] <LocalPCGuy> then fadeIn
[15:01:12] <basiclaser> LocalPCGuy: would my version work?
[15:01:20] <Lianzinho> hide won't set display: none ?
[15:01:22] <LocalPCGuy> that would fade in the entire page
[15:01:25] <jrockjiggz> $('#container').hide().html(data).fadeTo('fast',1);
[15:01:30] <LocalPCGuy> and hide would do display: none
[15:01:33] <xboi209> why is $("[attribute='']") faster than $("element[attribute='']")?
[15:01:38] <basiclaser> ah ok
[15:01:59] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 1 less thing to match
[15:02:17] <jrockjiggz> xboi209: the parse reads right to left, so once you have an attribute match, there is no need to continue unless you need it to
[15:02:18] <xboi209> oh sorry, i meant the other way around
[15:02:19] <Lianzinho> my problem is that I want to manipulate just the children of the element. Because the loader is set as the parent element background...
[15:02:43] <Lianzinho> if I display: none it, the loader will hide too...
[15:03:19] <jrockjiggz> Lianzinho: dont put loading inside the html
[15:03:52] <jrockjiggz> Lianzinho: or, replace the container HTML with the loader
[15:03:54] <LocalPCGuy> lianzinho instead of doing .html and the opacity 0 on the container/ loader element, you should add everything to a new element you create, and then add that element to the container and fade it in
[15:04:01] <LocalPCGuy> that way the container doesn't ever change
[15:04:44] <xboi209> why is $("element[attribute='']") faster than $("[attribute='']")?
[15:05:06] <xboi209> im curious o.o
[15:05:16] <LocalPCGuy> $('#container').html($('#loader').css('opacity', 0)); $('#loader').show();
[15:06:08] <Lianzinho> LocalPCGuy: yeah, I thought about that, hahahaha, but it would be the lazy solution and I just tried to do without it. But now I release that it would be much more reasonable... hehehe. A lot of operations less...
[15:06:09] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 probably because jQuery finds only the elements that match element first, and then does the attribute selector matching, whereas the one without an element has to run the attribute matching against every element in the DOm
[15:06:22] <Lianzinho> *realize
[15:06:38] <xboi209> but i thought jQuery reads right to left
[15:06:46] <xboi209> so how would it know there's an element to match with
[15:06:53] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 css does, not 100% which way jQuery read it
[15:07:00] <xboi209> :o
[15:07:18] <tubbo> xboi209: there's a way to get all elements by tag name in JS
[15:07:34] <tubbo> xboi209: so i bet jQuery runs that if you include a tag name to keep the amount of shit it has to search through a little smaller
[15:07:44] <xboi209> mmmm
[15:07:48] <tubbo> thereby decreasing the amount of time it takes to search through the collection
[15:08:01] <LocalPCGuy> yah, it is probably optimized to do things that don't require string matching first
[15:08:06] <tubbo> (btw it's document.getElementsByTagName('input') in case you were wondering. :) )
[15:08:34] <LocalPCGuy> can always dive into the source for sizzle (the selector engine in jquery) to see for sure
[15:08:39] <tubbo> on modern browsers, $('.whatever') is really fast too
[15:08:44] <LocalPCGuy> bot-t ? sizzle
[15:09:24] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot ? sizzle
[15:09:33] <tubbo> ?sizzle
[15:09:40] <LocalPCGuy> meh, I forgot my b-ot cmds
[15:09:42] <tubbo> ?mynizzle
[15:09:47] <tubbo> *shrug* he's dead
[15:09:50] <LocalPCGuy> :(
[15:09:56] <LocalPCGuy> :'(
[15:10:15] <basiclaser> bizzle :<
[15:12:10] <LocalPCGuy> Resig talks about sizzle in this video I believe http://ejohn.org/blog/the-dom-is-a-mess/
[15:14:41] <sahbeewah> xboi209, what makes you say it's faster?
[15:14:47] <xboi209> jsperf test
[15:15:23] <sahbeewah> link?
[15:15:47] <xboi209> http://jsperf.com/xboi209-icccleaner
[15:17:04] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 so I'd take that test to say that you should use whichever one is more readable as it is pretty close
[15:17:21] <xboi209> it isn't close for me o.o
[15:17:22] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 i.e. don't over optimize on the things that don't make a difference
[15:17:23] <jrajav> xboi209: Because element[attribute=''] can filter by tag first, which is a native DOM operation, so that it does not have to iterate over as many elements.
[15:17:37] <LocalPCGuy> 1.53%
[15:17:42] <jrajav> Also, that
[15:17:43] <sahbeewah> what browser are you using?
[15:17:46] <xboi209> chrome 25
[15:17:51] <jrajav> Use whichever one makes the most sense, do not prematurely optimize
[15:18:21] <LocalPCGuy> also, if you filter before you run that, it won't make a difference in production
[15:18:24] <Pixz> Hi !
[15:18:26] <LocalPCGuy> or shouldn't
[15:18:31] <sahbeewah> wait sorry i thought you were confused as to why element[attr] was faster
[15:18:41] <xboi209> i was
[15:18:46] <carpii> exactly. You can spend an hour shaving milliseconds off client side activity, and the user will not notice any different
[15:18:47] <xboi209> question was already answered
[15:19:01] <LocalPCGuy> 2 is don't something different than 1 and 3 btw
[15:19:01] <xboi209> the question was both curiosity and for speed
[15:19:07] <LocalPCGuy> err don't= doing
[15:19:21] <LocalPCGuy> 2 is getting the string in the registration attribute
[15:19:35] <LocalPCGuy> 1 and 3 are getting jQuery objects representing the dom elements that match
[15:19:48] <LocalPCGuy> big difference
[15:19:59] <Pixz> is there someone who could help me a little ? ><
[15:20:17] <LocalPCGuy> Pixz just ask, don't ask if you can ask :)
[15:20:28] <xboi209> LocalPCGuy: isn't 2 just selecting?
[15:20:34] <Pixz> LocalPCGuy, thx, i will :)
[15:20:53] <LocalPCGuy> xboi209 nope, 2 is getting the attribute on a link that is named registration
[15:20:53] <xboi209> oh i get it now
[15:21:04] <LocalPCGuy> which doesn't exist i believe
[15:21:30] <xboi209> :o
[15:22:11] <LocalPCGuy> good place to say if you like jsperf, you may want to back this kickstarter:
[15:22:11] <LocalPCGuy> http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/the-jsperf-guide-book
[15:22:33] <LocalPCGuy> sorry for the spam but hoping it gets backed
[15:23:04] <carpii> does it need a guide book?
[15:23:10] <Pixz> So, my problem is that i can't find a way to reverse my little jquery script to make appear and disappear some divs here : http://piixz.free.fr/?p=projects
[15:23:38] <Pixz> I really dunno if its a proper way to ask help here ^^
[15:23:53] <LocalPCGuy> pixz how is it breaking?
[15:24:46] <Pixz> the thing is, i find a way to make appear the div when you click on the "click div", and i dont know how to reverse it. Click again on it, and make the div disappear
[15:25:37] <LocalPCGuy> pixz you'll need a test inside the click event that determines if it is visible (then hide) or hidden (then show)
[15:26:08] <LocalPCGuy> pixz something like if ($('.project_description').is(':visible')
[15:26:23] <Pixz> ok i see
[15:26:25] <LocalPCGuy> ) { do hide stuff } else { do show stuff }
[15:26:39] <Pixz> but, isnt that easier with toggle function ?
[15:27:00] <Pixz> i search how to deal with toggle, but it always fail :x
[15:27:03] <LocalPCGuy> personally, I rarely use toggle as it doesn't give me the control I want
[15:27:11] <Pixz> ok ^^
[15:27:25] <LocalPCGuy> you'll find a lot of jQuery "helpers" are just wrappers for a few core functions
[15:27:48] <LocalPCGuy> and if you learn how to use the core functions, you'll have more fine grain control over your code (might take a bit longer to write though)
[15:28:19] <Pixz> ok, i'll try to make an if statement to get what i want so
[15:28:23] <LocalPCGuy> k
[15:28:26] <LocalPCGuy> gl
[15:28:30] <Pixz> thx LocalPCGuy !
[15:28:31] <Pixz> :)
[15:53:56] <Pixz> LocalPCGuy, still here ?
[15:54:13] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[15:54:59] <Pixz> i make the if statement, but the "click event" doesn't work on the second click
[15:55:06] <Pixz> http://piixz.free.fr/?p=projects
[15:56:12] <LocalPCGuy> pixz instead of testing against the display status, just test against the :visible property
[15:56:26] <LocalPCGuy> $('.project_description').is(':visible')
[15:56:39] <LocalPCGuy> assign that to the p_desc_status var
[15:56:54] <LocalPCGuy> and then get rid of the = 'none'
[15:57:20] <Pixz> omw thx !
[15:58:00] <Pixz> is that better to use the visibility property instead of display ?
[15:58:14] <LocalPCGuy> pixz but the actual problem with the code is that you are using = not == in your if statement
[15:58:43] <Pixz> ><
[15:58:47] <LocalPCGuy> pixz if you make it == 'none' it should work the way you have it
[15:59:09] <LocalPCGuy> :visible is not the same thing as visibility
[15:59:18] <LocalPCGuy> don't confuse the two
[15:59:21] <Pixz> oh
[15:59:33] <LocalPCGuy> .is() returns a boolean on the property you pass in
[15:59:52] <Pixz> yeah, but ":visible" refers to what so ?
[16:00:00] <LocalPCGuy> ':visible' checks for display, opacity, visibility to see if it is actually able to be seen
[16:00:14] <Pixz> okay
[16:00:42] <LocalPCGuy> http://api.jquery.com/?s=%3Avisible
[16:00:49] <Pixz> Thanks !
[16:00:53] <LocalPCGuy> you can test against :visible or :hidden
[16:01:00] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[16:01:23] <Pixz> I'll make it work and tell you so
[16:05:59] <Pixz> LocalPCGuy, done. Thanks for your help :)
[16:06:13] <LocalPCGuy> np, glad to hear it
[16:34:53] <HarryPitfall> is possible to create a 'jQuery' function, that returns something else than the selector?
[16:35:08] <HarryPitfall> for example, I want to make a 'pluck'
[16:35:19] <HarryPitfall> $('div').pluck('data', 'id')
[16:35:36] <HarryPitfall> instead the jQuery selector for chaining, it's return a ordinary array
[16:36:29] <LocalPCGuy> HarryPitfall jQuery is just javascript, so you can create a JavaScript function that takes a jQuery object and returns the array you want
[16:36:46] <HarryPitfall> yes, i can do that
[16:36:55] <HarryPitfall> but i wish to turn into a jquery plugin
[16:37:12] <LocalPCGuy> a jQuery plugin should return jQuery
[16:37:48] <LocalPCGuy> or an object - it should work like people expect it to work
[16:40:32] <LocalPCGuy> have any code (jsfiddle?) - I can't tell from what you wrote exactly what the expected behavior is
[16:47:39] <thinkerweb> can you make a call back to file upload inputs (<input type="file"></input>) ?
[16:49:16] <HarryPitfall> what kind of callback?
[16:49:27] <HarryPitfall> and i manage to make my $ plugin
[16:49:59] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb you can listen for the "change" event on file upload inputs
[16:50:20] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb and then execute a function...is that what you are trying to do?
[16:50:46] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, yep, exactly
[16:51:17] <thinkerweb> HarryPitfall, like I wanna do some jquery scripting, once a file upload happens
[16:52:14] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb so the change event doesn't happen after the actual upload, just after the file is selected
[16:52:23] <thinkerweb> I mean: I have a file input <input type="file" />, when a user uploads a file, I wanna call a function
[16:52:33] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, no, the file must be uploaded successfully
[16:52:43] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb that requires some back/forth with the server to know that
[16:52:58] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, I can do that with ajax
[16:53:26] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, I've used $.ajax() function before
[16:53:26] <HarryPitfall> modern browsers supports some tricks about file uploads using ajax
[16:53:43] <HarryPitfall> old browsers will require iframes for this :/
[16:53:46] <thinkerweb> HarryPitfall, I wanna support starting from IE8
[16:54:29] <HarryPitfall> if you bind 'load' on the iframe (that is the target of the form with file upload)
[16:54:40] <HarryPitfall> you can know that the file transfer is ended
[16:54:41] <thinkerweb> I don't want to use iframe
[16:55:40] <tw2113> can't blame you
[16:56:11] <HarryPitfall> if you want a async file upload, you have only two options
[16:56:25] <HarryPitfall> modern browser that supports File / FormData
[16:56:31] <HarryPitfall> and ajax for it
[16:56:40] <HarryPitfall> or iframe to rule then all
[17:31:40] <StephenS> I have a problem with .show
[17:31:42] <StephenS> can someone help me?
[17:33:12] <sahbeewah> you won't know until you ask
[17:34:44] <StephenS> Why does this not work http://jsfiddle.net/FcFgy/1/
[17:34:50] <StephenS> I mean it work for me on my web with toggle
[17:34:58] <StephenS> but when I put show() instead toggle, it does not work
[17:37:41] <StephenS> sahbeewah,
[17:37:51] <StephenS> help me man you know you can and I need help you know what it is
[17:38:15] <sahbeewah> i know very little,
[17:38:26] <sahbeewah> what are you trying to do? it seems to work
[17:38:35] <StephenS> it work on show
[17:38:41] <StephenS> but when I click on that button, it does not hide
[17:39:00] <sahbeewah> .show() doesn't hide, it only shows
[17:39:57] <StephenS> ok so how do i add hide() when its showed?
[17:40:01] <StephenS> I mean how to check, on which event
[17:40:13] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQuery
[17:41:00] <Foxhoundz> I've come to lend the little knowledge I have of jQ and, perhaps, borrow a nugget of your wisdom.
[17:42:33] <sahbeewah> StephenS, http://jsfiddle.net/FcFgy/3/ is probably what you're after
[17:43:57] <jrajav> Automatic Semicolon Insertion visualizer, for anyone who's interested: http://jsbin.com/onoqif/2
[17:44:18] <StephenS> Thanks sahbeewah it works :)
[17:47:28] <noxim> Hola
[17:49:28] <noxim> Any idea why $().on doesnt detect manual addClass ?
[17:52:06] <sahbeewah> noxim, please elaborate
[17:52:57] <noxim> I'm manually adding <div> with an addClass().. but i cannot bind() or on() on them..
[17:53:39] <noxim> http://pastebin.com/h7McGe3b
[17:55:23] <sahbeewah> noxim, your bind occurs on document ready, at which point any future elements generated by AddBox does not exist in the dom
[17:55:50] <sahbeewah> bindings can only affect elements which exist in the dom at the point of invocation
[17:56:05] <noxim> oh.. i understand
[17:56:17] <noxim> For that example, what should i do ?
[17:56:54] <noxim> Should i .. bind outside dready ?
[17:57:42] <sahbeewah> $(".boxtest").on("mouseover",function() {  ===> $(parent/ancestor container for boxtest that exists on document ready).on("mouseover", ".boxtest", function() { ...
[18:12:34] <noxim> sahbeewah, it works
[18:12:46] <noxim> not sure yet why.. but it works
[18:12:53] <noxim> thx :)
[18:19:44] <sahbeewah> noxim, basically, any event that happens on an element, happens to all of its ancestors as well
[18:20:21] <sahbeewah> because if you click on a button, you're also clicking on the form containing the button, you're also clicking the container in which the form exists in, and you're also clicking the "body" tag, in which that container exists in
[18:21:13] <sahbeewah> so we flip it around and say hey, if there's a "mouseover" over this element that exists, check if the underlying element is actually a "boxtext" element, and if it is, delegate the event handler to that guy
[18:21:45] <noxim> I see
[18:23:09] <[fields]> I have a form input that when I check its value it always yields undefined
[18:23:30] <[fields]> I'm sorry, i need help and I'm not sure where to start
[18:24:33] <sahbeewah> [fields], docs.jquery.com is a good starting place
[18:24:47] <sahbeewah> api.jquery.com, rather
[18:24:49] <[fields]> I write a form with .html() there is namespace involved because multiple instances of this form can be produced by .click of another element
[18:25:07] <noxim> sahbeewah, http://pastebin.com/AWhj9WxZ
[18:25:27] <noxim> so, on load, mouseover not workin
[18:25:37] <LocalPCGuy> [fields] are you using ID's on the form fields?  duplicate IDs can have some...interesting (and bad) ... results
[18:25:39] <[fields]> I'm trying to do validation on the form, I notice the .submit of the form or the .click of the button, but when checking the value of the text input its like it doesn't exist
[18:25:49] <noxim> then, mouseout and mouseover again make it works..
[18:25:55] <noxim> whats happening ?
[18:26:02] <[fields]> LocalPCGuy: yes.  but I'm using an incrementing counter in my naming conventions to keep each id unique
[18:26:23] <LocalPCGuy> [fields] k, that is good
[18:26:43] <[fields]> but not when its time to look at a particular text input and its always an object with undefined value
[18:26:44] <LocalPCGuy> [fields] what jQuery cmd are you using to get the field ( guessing .val() )
[18:26:59] <LocalPCGuy> [fields] and do you have a code sample posted somewhere public?
[18:27:07] <LocalPCGuy> i.e. jsfiddle
[18:27:09] <[fields]> to make matters worse when I copied the important stuff to a jsfiddle, the value alerted fine (for debugging purposes)
[18:27:48] <LocalPCGuy> yah, really sounds like either a selector isn't correct or something like that
[18:28:16] <[fields]> I think at a certain level, my counter variable gets ignored
[18:28:26] <LocalPCGuy> try logging the input to the console just before you try to read it
[18:28:42] <LocalPCGuy> see exactly what you're looking at
[18:28:50] <sahbeewah> noxim, http://pastebin.com/index/s037pTjg
[18:30:46] <noxim> ahh
[18:31:13] <noxim> so the bind is on any element inside #container
[18:31:34] <noxim> then we specify .boxtest class as an argument
[18:31:36] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, does anyone have a good example of a draggable treeview?
[18:31:51] <lethjakman_lapto> is there a good library for that or something?
[18:32:09] <sahbeewah> noxim, yeah so that the handler only affects elements satisfying the ".boxtest" criteria
[18:33:34] <noxim> i didnt know about the "criteria" thought it was a place for the data
[18:33:48] <noxim> { message : msg }
[18:34:44] <sahbeewah> yes you can also add that after it for data
[18:34:52] <sahbeewah> have a look at the method signature in the docs
[18:34:58] <sahbeewah> .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
[18:35:06] <sahbeewah> where the criteria is the selector
[18:35:15] <sahbeewah> [fields], paste some code
[18:35:53] <sahbeewah> [fields], you're probably having a closure problem - it's a bit icky when you attach event handlers in a loop
[18:38:14] <lethjakman_lapto> does anyone here have anythign to say about jstree?
[18:45:36] <esas> Good or bad idea to make a jQuery like lib for c++ which employs a "DOM tree" (but events and control to C++ instead of javascript) that is rendered by a HTML engine?
[19:44:50] <go> hi everyone
[19:45:19] <go> I'm really new to jquery and javascript, could someone help me with a json "reading", please? Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/ES7Cp/ - What am I doing wrong?
[19:47:36] <[fields]> http://jsfiddle.net/Xaeyb/1/ - can anyone help me as to why the .val() is undefined?
[19:50:19] <pototo> @[fields] I'm guessing you're mixing up addURLform_ and addUrl somewhere
[19:51:25] <[fields]> go:  you don't need script tags in the jsfiddle javascript box.  you also needed to activate jquery to utilize $.getJSON and there was a missing + for string concatenation before the </li> http://jsfiddle.net/ES7Cp/1/
[19:51:48] <[fields]> go: also, it looks like the URL you fetch doesn't exist
[19:53:25] <go> [fields]: here's the url http://xtradio.org/API/song.php
[19:53:51] <gamesNmusic> How do I remove the yellowish border that appears when a tab is in focus on the jQueryUI tabs widget (base theme)? Here's an example of the border http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[19:55:26] <go> and that's new i am, i don't even know how to use jsfiddle lol
[19:56:00] <go> *that's how
[19:57:31] <thinkerweb> $("form").submit(function(event) will act on all forms in the page?
[19:57:46] <[fields]> i believe so
[19:57:57] <[fields]> if any are submitted, do this
[19:58:12] <thinkerweb> [fields], thx
[19:59:19] <go> this is the php gile that does the encoding: http://pastebin.com/QsFXqSre
[19:59:31] <go> and as far as I see it, it outputs correctly
[20:00:07] <[fields]> oh, you need jqxhr to go cross domain
[20:00:56] <go> [fields]: how can I do that?
[20:08:28] <sahbeewah> go, you can use jsonp to retrieve it,
[20:08:35] <sahbeewah> change the url to http://xtradio.org/API/song.php?callback=?
[20:09:20] <go> oh, thank you sahbeewah
[20:14:05] <[fields]> sabeewah, did you see my fiddle?
[20:14:22] <[fields]> I should pretty it up
[20:18:00] <thinkerweb> is it possible to call a php script in you javascript, without ajax. Or you think it is safe to use $.ajax without the type: "POST" spec?
[20:18:09] <sahbeewah> [fields], looked at it just then
[20:18:18] <sahbeewah> [fields], you have a closure problem
[20:19:29] <sahbeewah> the value of i is being evaluated inside the submit handler at the point of invocation
[20:20:02] <[fields]> researching javascript closures, thank you
[20:22:00] <sahbeewah> thinkerweb, no you can't call a php script in javascript without ajax
[20:22:16] <sahbeewah> thinkerweb, you can use type: "GET"? all depends on what you want to do
[20:22:27] <thinkerweb> sahbeewah, what about calling jquery within php
[20:22:47] <LocalPCGuy> and [fields] disappeared, never to be heard from again...last words, "researching javascript closures"
[20:22:55] <thinkerweb> sahbeewah, well it works if you use $.ajax with type: but maybe its bad to do it
[20:22:56] <[fields]> yo
[20:23:13] <thinkerweb> sahbeewah,I mean with type:
[20:23:17] <thinkerweb> sahbeewah,I mean with OUT type:
[20:24:35] <sahbeewah> thinkerweb, if you don't specify the type option it just defaults to a GET request
[20:24:44] <thinkerweb> I wanna load some page content based on php database SELECT, for each row in the table, I wanna create a correspind <div>
[20:25:47] <Croves> Hey guys! :P
[20:25:57] <Croves> There is something wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/AVgFmrzh
[20:26:19] <Croves> Oh, wait... wrong code
[20:26:41] <thinkerweb> sahbeewah, I see, thx
[20:29:56] <mitzev_> anyone know of any good tutorials for sticky/fixed elements like a menu or header/sidebar etc?
[20:30:16] <mitzev_> and/or are there any standard plugins for this?
[20:36:43] <sahbeewah> mitzev_, dno about plugins, but you can literally just set the css on an element: "position: fixed, left: $(x-coord), top: $(y-coord), width: $(menuWidth), height: $(menuHeight)"
[20:36:51] <sahbeewah> ta-da, sticky menu
[20:38:26] <tw2113> sometimes i wonder if people in here are afraid to do stuff with anything but jQuery
[20:40:28] <Rafajafar> hey I have a jQueryUI question, is this the place to be?
[20:40:50] <beachandbytes> sure
[20:40:52] <Rafajafar> http://pastebin.com/pm94yujZ
[20:40:59] <Rafajafar> I've reduced this page to the barest components
[20:41:05] <Rafajafar> you can actually save it and run it yourself
[20:41:19] <Rafajafar> I cannot for the life of me figure out why the tabs aren't working
[20:41:21] <tw2113> or you could make a jsfiddle and save us the trouble :P
[20:41:31] <Rafajafar> ok what... ok let me do that
[20:41:40] <tw2113> jsfiddle.net
[20:42:19] <Rafajafar> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/VQegq/
[20:42:49] <Rafajafar> I'm referencing the cdns for everything, I check to make sure they're pulling up, they are
[20:42:56] <Rafajafar> yet the tabs aren't showing up for some reason
[20:43:48] <beachandbytes> the selector does not work like that
[20:43:50] <Rafajafar> annnnd im a tard
[20:43:53] <Rafajafar> yup
[20:44:11] <Rafajafar> wow after an hour... just took me asking someone to see the problem
[20:44:20] <Rafajafar> id="#tabs-1" is not right
[20:44:34] <beachandbytes> # tells the selector it is an id
[20:45:01] <Rafajafar> yup, I know
[20:45:21] <Rafajafar> been using jqueryui since 2010
[20:45:29] <Rafajafar> just ... gooofffeed
[20:45:31] <Rafajafar> sorry to bother
[20:46:02] <beachandbytes> $('li[id^="tabs"]')
[20:46:10] <beachandbytes> will get all li that start with tabs
[20:46:54] <Rafajafar> buh?
[20:47:03] <Rafajafar> why would I need that
[20:48:05] <gamesNmusic> How do I remove the golden border that appears when a tab is in focus on the jQueryUI tabs widget (base theme)? Here's an example of the border in action--just click on a tab-- http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[20:48:08] <beachandbytes> well use divds
[20:49:20] <beachandbytes> gamesNmusic it is outline
[20:49:24] <beachandbytes> probably the chrome focus outline
[20:49:31] <beachandbytes> :focus {outline:none;} to remove it from everything
[20:49:47] <Rafajafar> so apparently that wasn't the problem....
[20:49:48] <Rafajafar> http://jsfiddle.net/VQegq/2/
[20:49:50] <Rafajafar> this is updated
[20:49:52] <Rafajafar> still not working
[20:50:07] <sahbeewah> Rafajafar, your tab button structure is a bit off... you need an "a" tag, "href" is an invalid attribute for a list item
[20:50:09] <sahbeewah> http://jsfiddle.net/VQegq/1/
[20:50:42] <Rafajafar> *sigh* thank you again, can you tell I'm tired? *blushes*
[20:51:48] <Rafajafar> bingo, thanks sahbeewah, you're the man
[20:51:53] <Rafajafar> or woman
[20:51:55] <gamesNmusic> Damn! After an hour of playing with the CSS :P... Thanks beachandbytes

[21:35:06] <thinkerweb> if I use php to make some html markup, how do I hand it over to jquery to insert into dom?
[21:55:06] <[fields]> it was good to learn more about closures, I got my code to work at jsfiddle by simply adding the word 'return ' in the appropriate place.  But copying this over to my local file and running it, never fires?
[22:28:59] <limpc> does vertical-align not work on text within a div when the div is absolutely positioned?
[22:29:21] <limpc> im trying to align text to the middle, with vertical-align: middle; but it doesnt seem to have any effect.  div height is static
[22:30:26] <snover> 1. vertical-align has to do with the alignment of inline content to the text box, not alignment to the block box; 2. you want #css

[22:42:29] <thinkerweb> If I have a php variable with some html markup, how can I add it to the dom and insert using append?
[22:44:08] <[fields]> I have an $.ajax() that is successfully getting JSON data, just a set of name value pairs.  How do I access this data to write its content elsewhere?
[22:44:10] <limpc> $(yourhtmlvar).appendTo('#domid')
[22:44:55] <limpc> [fields]: success: function(data) { console.log(data.somevalue); }
[22:47:30] <[fields]> limpc:  I can alert(data) which shows a name value pair named "title", when I alert(data.title) the value is undefined
[22:48:29] <[fields]> I feel like I'm receiving as text and not as JSON
[22:57:27] <sahbeewah> [fields], JSON is text. What you want is the javascript object, which you can retrieve by doing something like, var dataObject = JSON.parse(data);
[23:06:07] <[fields]> excellent, did the trick.  but of course I have a new unexpected issue
[23:17:41] <[fields]> in my application, click or drag from a button in to a sortable section produces a form with a unique id.  I no longer able to make the new instances unless I reorder the sortable.  Does anyone have an ideas on how to resolve this?
