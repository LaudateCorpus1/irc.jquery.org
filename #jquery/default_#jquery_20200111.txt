[04:14:10] <sadako> Why isn't my isInViewport function working? https://jsfiddle.net/wpes4hqm/6/  If a node is visible within where it's scrolled to, it should be returning true.
[04:19:22] <sadako> I'm getting weird numbers for elementTop.  310.66668701171875 for example when the viewport is 300 high but it's clearly in view
[04:19:55] <sadako> oh that's offset based on window not the scroller
[04:25:02] <sadako> https://jsfiddle.net/wpes4hqm/7/ it's still wrong, using javascript's native node.offsetTop
[04:27:26] <sadako> oh wait it's the elementBottom that's wrong
[04:32:18] <sadako> nvm it's both but yeah i dont get why i'm getting the wrong offset top here
[04:36:01] <sadako> https://jsfiddle.net/37dmh8x6/ position().top works but only if the container is set to position:relative. So what do I do where I don't have to set position to relative when I don't wish to?
[09:54:53] <grid-> hey
[20:03:57] <duckgoose> HELLO
[20:04:02] <duckgoose> I have a problem
[20:04:58] <duckgoose> when I do $("textarea").val("test \\n 123"); I expect the value to be "test \n 123"
[20:05:20] <duckgoose> instead the \ ends up being some weird W character
[20:07:42] <duckgoose> https://media.haxed.net/F_RfU-AWHL.png
[20:07:43] <pavonia> Weird w character? "\\n" should render as a literal \ followed by an n
[20:08:05] <pavonia> Huh
[20:13:04] <duckgoose> thanks for listening
[20:13:18] <duckgoose> just found out the problem is font related not jquery
[20:13:22] <duckgoose> nvm!
