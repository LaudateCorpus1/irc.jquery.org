[00:01:03] <toomus> Hi all
[00:03:30] <Max-P> toomus: hi.
[00:04:10] <toomus> How to detect if textarea is empty?
[00:04:37] <Cork> .val().length
[00:04:49] <toomus> nope, this doesnt work
[00:04:51] <Max-P> ^ beat me to it
[00:04:54] <Cork> yes it does
[00:04:56] <Max-P> It should
[00:05:22] <toomus> no, yiu forget about blank sybols, eg. new line
[00:05:51] <Max-P> To me blank symbols are content
[00:06:03] <toomus> ah ok :P
[00:06:07] <Cork> toomus: http://jsfiddle.net/ddcnbz9f/
[00:06:26] <Max-P> Then .val().trim().length I guess
[00:06:36] <Cork> ya
[00:48:12] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[00:48:20] <al-damiri> I'm having some issues in understanding .data()
[00:48:25] <al-damiri> https://jsfiddle.net/8t90ezbd/3/
[00:49:04] <al-damiri> I have a <div> inside which a table is generated by _.template (underscore.js) and then the .data() function is called on it.
[00:49:07] <Cork> al-damiri: data is normally used together with a key
[00:49:21] <al-damiri> The data which is set is an object itself.
[00:49:38] <al-damiri> Now I don't get how the data object is assigned to each individual row?
[00:49:47] <Cork> it isn't
[00:49:51] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:49:54] <al-damiri> Cork: If you could please give the jsfiddle a look above.
[00:50:03] <Cork> i am
[00:50:16] <al-damiri> Cork: What happens is that the <tr> is assigned the values which are in the array assignments.
[00:50:18] <Cork> .data is related to "element" not the rows in it
[00:50:51] <Cork> how data works is that jquery has a cache internally
[00:51:11] <Cork> and it sets a reference on all elements and use this reference as a key in the cache table
[00:51:35] <Cork> if the element has a data-* attribute the cache is populated with this data if the cache is empty
[00:51:49] <Cork> that is all .data does
[00:52:39] <al-damiri> Cork: I see but from above code, I'm able to do row.data('fullname') and I get the fullname from the assignments array (which was set with .data().
[00:52:42] <al-damiri> )
[00:53:00] <al-damiri> where row is -> var row = $(this).parents("tr");
[00:53:15] <al-damiri> and "this" is a button in the <tr>
[00:53:32] <Cork> what?
[00:54:10] <Cork> what does that have to do with .data?
[00:54:54] <al-damiri> Cork: I'm unable to grasp how does the row.data('fullname') call work?
[00:55:05] <al-damiri> How did it got assigned in the first place.
[00:55:13] <al-damiri> Pardon me, I should have posted the full code.
[00:55:18] <al-damiri> It will be clear then.
[00:55:59] <Cork> al-damiri: cache = { elementkey: dataObjectYouProvided }; cache[elementkey]['fullname']
[00:56:46] <Cork> but it should be .data('assignments')[0]['fullname']
[00:56:59] <Cork> from the structure you have in the javascript section
[00:57:13] <al-damiri> Cork: No, there is no key set. Let me post the full code.
[00:57:55] <Cork> al-damiri: i'll update that fiddle and remove all unrelated parts, give me a min
[00:59:35] <Cork> al-damiri: https://jsfiddle.net/8t90ezbd/4/
[00:59:52] <Cork> 'div' is placeholder for how jquery actually does it, but it doesn't matter for the example
[01:00:29] <Cork> console.log($('div').data() is equiv with cache['div']
[01:01:05] <al-damiri> Cork: This is the full code (well not the whole code obviously.)
[01:01:08] <al-damiri> Cork: Let me check.
[01:01:12] <al-damiri> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/phujj9gy/
[01:02:45] <al-damiri> Cork: In above snippet how does this work? `var row = $(this).parents("tr"); $(element).find('#student-name').text(row.data('fullname'));` ?
[01:02:47] <Cork> al-damiri: that data convertion doesn't happen in jquery
[01:03:11] <al-damiri> davlefou: Which?
[01:03:20] <Cork> either it is a different set of data entries, or something is parsing the data and setting it again
[01:03:20] <al-damiri> Cork: Which?
[01:03:23] <DarsVaeda> why does this get stuck on the 5th after the 26th? http://jsfiddle.net/3jzhqjp9/1/
[01:03:27] <Cork> something that isn't in that code
[01:04:07] <al-damiri> Cork: Is it something done by the _.template() function (in underscore.js)?
[01:04:27] <Cork> al-damiri: not inherrently no
[01:04:57] <al-damiri> Cork: Then?
[01:05:02] <Cork> al-damiri: btw using parents there is risky it should have been .closest()
[01:05:15] <Cork> al-damiri: i'm not a psychic
[01:05:19] <al-damiri> Cork: It is some existing code which I'm trying to understand.
[01:05:20] <al-damiri> Cork: :)
[01:05:22] <Cork> all i can say is "somethign else is"
[01:05:30] <Cork> al-damiri: it isn't in the code you shared
[01:05:43] <al-damiri> Cork: Okay let me see if I can reproduce it.
[01:06:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: str please?
[01:06:34] <DarsVaeda> sorry?
[01:06:53] <Cork> Steps To Reproduce
[01:07:08] <Cork> i don't follow what problem you're asking about
[01:07:40] <DarsVaeda> ah okay actually you should just select from
[01:07:58] <Cork> and?
[01:08:08] <DarsVaeda> then look at the console output
[01:08:28] <al-damiri> Cork: Sorry my bad. I had mistakenly pasted the wrong template HTML. I'm trying to get the thing reproduce on a jsFiddle.
[01:08:36] <DarsVaeda> it outputs dates from 31.6. to 26.6. but then goes on with 5.7.
[01:08:36] <davlefou> al-damiri, ?
[01:09:00] <DarsVaeda> ah sorry meant 31.5. to 26.6. then 5.7.
[01:09:19] <al-damiri> davlefou: Sorry it was a typo, mistake.
[01:09:28] <DarsVaeda> so I wonder where are the dates 27.6. to 30.6.
[01:12:05] <DarsVaeda> Cork, can you follow or is it different for you?
[01:15:09] <al-damiri> Cork: Thanks.
[01:15:40] <al-damiri> Cork: While trying to reproduce the issue in a snippet on jsFiddle, I found the place where the actual mapping was happening.
[01:15:56] <al-damiri> Cork: Yes you were right, there is indeed another .data() happening in here.
[01:16:05] <al-damiri> Cork: Thank you very much.
[01:18:25] <DarsVaeda> Cork, nvm it seems to be a bug in my firefox
[02:20:24] <Bjerre> Any tips I can get from someone? I need to change the img src with a crossfade between the pictures. Each image should be assigned to a button. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/
[02:34:03] <Bjerre> If someone got time I would greatly appreciate some advice on how I can change src with different buttons and make a crossfade between images. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/
[02:38:44] <cusiousmansi> Bjerre: its simple. there are many ways
[02:39:06] <cusiousmansi> you have to attach the event click on the button and then change the source of the image
[02:44:30] <Bjerre> cusiousmansi: this went really bad http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/3/
[02:45:13] <Bjerre> oh I had image1 on button click
[02:45:19] <Bjerre> however, it should not fade again after click
[02:46:00] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/4/
[02:46:11] <cusiousmansi> http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/2/
[02:48:27] <cusiousmansi> did  u check my solution, similarly you can add for other buttons as i have done for button2
[02:50:16] <cusiousmansi> http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/5/
[02:50:26] <miragee> i've this html code http://pastebin.com/F6kJ8t3F and i need to extract the first column/columns
[02:50:34] <miragee> can someone help me out ?
[02:50:50] <Bjerre> awesome cusiousmansi http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/6/
[02:51:00] <Bjerre> cusiousmansi: any idea on how to get it fade out?
[02:52:32] <Uhkis> wow, that is some 90s html right there
[02:55:07] <cusiousmansi> Uhkis: what do u mean by that. There are other way as well to achieve that . live keeping the list of img in an array and then tweaking the code
[02:56:47] <Uhkis> cusiousmansi: i mean what miragee pasted
[02:57:52] <miragee> Uhkis: tha'ts not my html code, its from an app i use in my job
[02:58:24] <miragee> can't change the html code, i what to add some jquery to it if its possible
[03:06:37] <cusiousmansi> any one knows how to make http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/6/ as fade in and fade out
[03:11:49] <compact> hey, I'm using https://github.com/Abban/jQueryFileUpload/blob/master/script.js for jquery file upload. how can i pass the input name?
[03:12:37] <Uhkis> cusiousmansi: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/9/
[03:13:43] <Uhkis> cusiousmansi: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/10/
[03:14:45] <cusiousmansi> Bjerre: check the one pasted by Uhkis Thanks Uhkis
[03:20:33] <Uhkis> Bjerre: and without fading if the same button is pressed again http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/11/
[03:21:39] <Woet> well done Uhkis
[03:23:22] <Uhkis> such Woet
[03:23:44] <Bjerre> sorry was afk Uhkis and cusiousmansi, that is awesome thank you so much! Just a little question: Is it possible to make it not fade to body color before fade in? Like a crossfade between the images
[03:24:05] <Bjerre> You guys are awesome :)
[03:28:39] <Bjerre> I assume that you need to keep the old image before fade in but how can I do that Uhkis?
[03:31:54] <Pazician> Bjerre: Some CSS and fadeIn() the new image that's overlaying the old image should do the thing?
[03:32:57] <Bjerre> ye but how Pazician? :) http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/11/
[03:33:02] <Bjerre> it sounds correct
[03:35:41] <Pazician> Bjerre: What're you really trying to do? It has already a image on load?
[03:36:28] <Bjerre> what I need Pazician is to make the transition between the images on each button to be a crossfade instead of a fade to 0 and up again
[03:36:57] <Bjerre> so it should be like image 1 fades to 0 and image to is set at 100% opacity
[03:37:09] <Bjerre> image 2"
[03:37:10] <Pazician> Alright, I think I got it
[03:37:27] <Bjerre> image1 fades to image2 is what it should be
[03:37:47] <Bjerre> and image2 fades to image1 if you click on button 1 when you're active on button 2
[03:39:10] <Bjerre> it should be easy if you have z-index in css and goes from button 1 to button 2 to button 3.... etc.. however, since the user can click on any of the buttons the z-index seems pointless
[03:39:14] <Bjerre> if you cant change it with jquery
[03:39:24] <Pazician> You could just use hide() instead of fadeOut()
[03:39:33] <Pazician> But that's not what you really want...
[03:40:06] <Bjerre> I dont think so no Pazician
[03:40:51] <Bjerre> perhaps it's not possible :/
[03:41:59] <Bjerre> Pazician: another idea I have is to make the background static, so that you only change the img
[03:42:57] <Bjerre> to explain my project there is 8 images that has the same structure (showing a satellite), however each image contains different colors on different parts of the satellite
[03:43:15] <Pazician> It's possible, the thing is just how to make it but it's possible for sure.
[03:43:15] <Bjerre> so what the buttons will do is to show the parts that are highlighted to the specific button
[03:43:49] <Bjerre> but I can easily add the satellite without any highlights as the background
[03:43:54] <Bjerre> in that way the transition wont look that bad
[03:44:10] <Bjerre> but it would be cool if the jquery actually xfaded
[03:44:12] <sharkbone> I am trying to list my data in tablesorter using the last published custom Posts in wordpress in descending order starting with the latest. Tablesorter seems to have a Default which is in alphabetical order. How do i get it to lists with this custom order. Thank you
[03:44:54] <Pazician> Bjerre: Are you from Gotet btw?
[03:45:05] <Bjerre> yea, how did you know?
[03:45:25] <Pazician> By your accent
[03:45:32] <Bjerre> by my accent?
[03:45:34] <sharkbone> jquery.tablesorter.min.js is what i am using
[03:45:58] <Pazician> Yes, do've a grov Goteborska?
[03:46:48] <sharkbone> And here is my code snippet  http://pastie.org/10244889
[03:47:26] <Bjerre> you checked my ip or what Pazician ?
[03:48:26] <Pazician> Bjerre: No, what's that?
[03:48:37] <Bjerre> trodde du kände mig först
[03:48:52] <Pazician> Kanske jag gor, but keep it English.
[03:49:12] <Bjerre> so, any idea Pazician on how to get the fade working?
[03:50:15] <Pazician> Bjerre: Probably through CSS, using some !important or something. The thing is that you're using data-img not img itself.
[03:50:34] <Bjerre> hm ok
[03:50:51] <Pazician> Look up how to target data-img
[03:55:06] <Pazician> Bjerre: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#attribute-selectors
[04:17:48] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/13/
[04:18:26] <Bjerre> Uhkis: You are insane
[04:18:35] <Bjerre> thank you sooo much"!
[04:18:39] <Uhkis> no i'm not :(
[04:18:49] <Bjerre> in a good way! :FD
[04:18:53] <Bjerre> cant even type right now
[04:18:58] <Bjerre> excited :D
[04:19:02] <Uhkis> :)
[04:19:19] <Uhkis> that actually looks pretty great
[04:19:24] <Bjerre> it looks awesome!
[04:26:29] <Bjerre> thank you so much Uhkis
[04:27:13] <Uhkis> Bjerre: np, that's what we're here for
[04:30:49] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/14/ the if is pointless now
[04:31:29] <Bjerre> why? is it because of the z-index?
[04:32:05] <Uhkis> because it fades to same image, you can't see it
[04:32:59] <Bjerre> You probably didnt notice but I accidently put two class="button" in the html on each button.
[04:33:08] <Bjerre> ah I see Uhkis
[04:33:57] <Bjerre> the new code works splendid :)
[04:43:06] <tocka> hi guys, i have a json object like {1: 100, 2: 150, 3:200, 4:250} how could i find a value in the object and then get the values index? :o
[04:43:39] <Cork> tocka: you would have to loop the object and check for the key
[04:43:52] <Cork> tocka: if you modified it to an array it would be simpler
[04:43:57] <tocka> Hm...
[04:44:09] <tocka> Cork how could I do it if it would be an array? :o
[04:44:12] <Cork> [ null, 100, 150, 200, 250 ]
[04:44:18] <Cork> [ null, 100, 150, 200, 250 ].index(150)
[04:44:26] <tocka> thanks:)
[04:44:28] <Cork> js> print([ null, 100, 150, 200, 250 ].index(150))
[04:44:30] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:44:33] <Cork> uh
[04:44:54] <Cork> opps
[04:44:56] <Cork> its indexOf
[04:45:00] <Cork> js> print([ null, 100, 150, 200, 250 ].indexOf(150))
[04:45:04] <b-ot> Cork: 2
[04:57:12] <tocka> thanks Cork  :)
[05:06:36] <bobdobbs`> how can I select
[05:06:56] <bobdobbs`> whoops, sorry. my return button is easily triggered
[05:07:17] <bobdobbs`> how can I select "*:before"
[05:07:24] <Cork> you can't
[05:07:28] <bobdobbs`> dang
[05:07:37] <Cork> :before is a psudo element, it doesn't exist
[05:07:49] <Cork> bobdobbs`: control it by setting a class on the element or a parent
[05:07:55] <bobdobbs`> hmmm
[05:07:57] <Cork> and style it in the css
[05:08:35] <bobdobbs`> I'm working on something where the best of all strategies is to style the :before element from js
[05:08:49] <bobdobbs`> that is, if it's possible to access from js
[05:08:57] <anom> Is there a generator that I can input a JS file and it'll tell me all the jquery functions im using?
[05:09:01] <Cork> that is normally a bad idea
[05:09:12] <bobdobbs`> Cork: agreed
[05:09:25] <Cork> anom: not check the jslint/jshint
[05:09:28] <Bjerre> Uhkis: I'm not sure but for some reason my images line up like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/16/  Keep in mind that I only added the top position in this fiddle to illustrate the problem.
[05:09:50] <bobdobbs`> Cork: I'm kinda pushing the limits of html here though. What I'm doing is bordering on  being a "javascript application"
[05:10:07] <Cork> bobdobbs`: that doesn't mean you should move styling to js
[05:10:07] <Bjerre> Is there a way to place them on eachother instead Uhkis
[05:10:14] <Bjerre> hi Cork  :)
[05:10:17] <Cork> o/
[05:10:26] <anom> Cork nevver used jslint. So JSLint will do that? 0.o
[05:10:36] <Cork> ?g jslint
[05:10:36] <b-ot> Cork: JSLint:The JavaScript Code Quality Tool → http://www.jslint.com/
[05:10:38] <Cork> ?g jshint
[05:10:41] <b-ot> Cork: JSHint, a JavaScript Code Quality Tool → http://jshint.com/
[05:10:47] <bobdobbs`> Cork: in this case, the html elements are static. But they will be styled depending on choices that the user makes while interacting with the app.
[05:11:03] <Cork> bobdobbs`: so set a class based on that selection
[05:11:13] <bobdobbs`> Cork: so the flow is something like: "if the user takes path A, then color the element blue"
[05:11:16] <Cork> bobdobbs`: i didn't say it shouldn't be controlled by js, just not styled by
[05:11:46] <bobdobbs`> oh yeah. addClass
[05:11:52] <Cork> exactly
[05:11:56] <bobdobbs`> oh damn. can't do that.
[05:12:02] <Cork> why not?
[05:12:21] <anom> I want to know what functions belong to jQuery, so I can keep them but remove the rest of jQuery though. JSLint isn't that.
[05:12:23] <bobdobbs`> I'll try an be concise, but its a complicated situation...
[05:12:37] <a_> hello
[05:13:02] <Bjerre> hello a_
[05:14:03] <bobdobbs`> Cork: actually, can we just assume it can't be done? an explanation would take a lot of work.
[05:14:25] <Cork> bobdobbs`: you can't modify the css for :before yes
[05:14:34] <Cork> (directly from inside js)
[05:14:36] <bobdobbs`> ok
[05:14:43] <Cork> but no, what you want to do is possible
[05:14:48] <Cork> you just need to do it the right way
[05:14:53] <bobdobbs`> ok
[05:20:06] <charlie_> can anyone tell me why this wont work http://www.bootply.com/9HN9vYOWtA ?
[05:21:04] <Cork> .width() won't ever be in percent
[05:21:52] <Cork> i recommend storing the "position" in ex. .data('value')
[05:22:06] <Cork> and inset set .css('width', .data('value') + '%')
[05:22:11] <Cork> *instead
[05:33:20] <decx> change the whole thing
[05:35:28] <charlie_> I just want the bar to animate from 0% to 100% over 10 seconds and then remove the active class.
[05:38:27] <decx> use animate
[05:43:16] <charlie_> decx: ok the first part of this works http://pastebin.com/BXLV4a4A
[05:43:42] <charlie_> why does the button that im removeing the invisble class from appear instantly though?
[05:43:46] <decx> use animates callback
[05:44:02] <bobdobbs`> I attached a click event to a button. But I can't find the line of file where I've done it. Is there a way to trace back to the file in which the behaviour is defined, by inspecting the DOM?
[05:44:38] <bobdobbs`> I mean, can the browser help me figure out the location of the line/file where the js behaviour attached to an element is defined?
[05:44:47] <decx> no
[05:45:04] <bobdobbs`> oh wait. I've found something
[05:45:15] <bobdobbs`> 'event listeners' in the Elements panel
[05:45:45] <bobdobbs`> oh wait. that links me back to the jQuery source. Not the line or file in which I defined the behavour
[05:46:56] <decx> should have another function under it
[05:46:59] <decx> linking to your line
[05:49:45] <Bjerre> Uhkis: Found a solution to the problem. Was a bit tricky, the editor that I use messed it all up making one image position itself below the other one. Used position: absolute instead of relative and that worked. Does not work in jsfiddle though.
[05:50:25] <bobdobbs`> decx: I'm not seeing anything pointing anywhere else
[05:56:16] <walabe> anyone know a good jquery gallery, like this: http://photoswipe.com/  but with no need for other plugins, just jquery
[05:59:20] <decx> why dont you just use this?
[06:04:26] <walabe> decx because it needs ruby and all these other things to be installed
[06:04:41] <walabe> I cannot figure out how to implement any of them anyway ugh
[06:04:52] <decx> but it says no dependencies !
[06:05:17] <walabe> oh

[06:13:15] <surianup> http://demo.stellans.com/propertyhub/listings/78
[06:13:16] <bobdobbs`> surianup: someone probably can help if your issue is related to jQuery and if you can describe that issue in concise detail
[06:13:38] <surianup> this is jquery issue buddy
[06:13:46] <surianup> anything conflict there
[06:13:56] <surianup> as I am not expert in Jquery
[06:14:03] <bobdobbs`> surianup: ok.
[06:14:11] <surianup> that's why I am asking herre
[06:14:20] <bobdobbs`> surianup: please describe your jQuery related issue then.
[06:15:10] <surianup> I have call that slider in scrit tag
[06:15:12] <surianup> $('.carousel').carousel();
[06:15:33] <surianup> but my all images are displaying on the page
[06:15:45] <surianup> But I need to be show the slider there
[06:15:59] <surianup> that slider working on the other page too
[06:16:01] <surianup> $('.carousel').carousel();
[06:16:11] <surianup> http://demo.stellans.com/propertyhub/listings/78
[06:16:16] <surianup> this is the link
[06:16:20] <bobdobbs`> have you looked at your network panel?
[06:16:20] <surianup> please click here'
[06:16:25] <surianup> yes
[06:16:29] <bobdobbs`> cool
[06:17:04] <surianup> I have got that error in console TypeError: f[0] is undefined
[06:17:06] <bobdobbs`> what is your conclusion from looking at the panel? What do you think that the feedback is tellnig you about why your slider isn't working?
[06:17:24] <surianup> I have got that error in console TypeError: f[0] is undefined
[06:17:33] <bobdobbs`> ok
[06:18:00] <bobdobbs`> now, I dont see that. but I do see issues that could be the cause of your slider not working.
[06:18:05] <Tennis> what do you mean by network panel?
[06:18:22] <bobdobbs`> Tennis: network panel of chrome developer tools
[06:18:32] <Tennis> ah i see
[06:18:41] <rickthuc> Hello, I am trying to make scrollr work here by stick a div when it reaches in the top of viewport for like 2-3 seconds, and then fade it out, and make the bottom part appear in parallax effect, and then show the footer, I have tried a lot of combinations of codes from their examples, but none seem to work, http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/2/ ?
[06:18:50] <rickthuc> sticking*
[06:18:50] <surianup> what is the issue  please let me knoe
[06:19:01] <surianup> and what is the solution
[06:19:11] <bobdobbs`> surianup: I'm trying to help you find the solution yourself.
[06:19:34] <bobdobbs`> surianup: answer the question: what do you see in your network panel that could be problematic?
[06:19:34] <surianup> thank you
[06:20:05] <surianup> there are some jquery files are not loading
[06:20:21] <walabe> surianup what is the name of the jquery slider you are trying to use
[06:20:55] <surianup> walabe http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel
[06:20:55] <bobdobbs`> surianup: you might have posted the wrong link. I'm not seeing any jQuery files failing to load
[06:22:10] <surianup> bobdobbs`then please let me know wjat I hvae to do
[06:22:12] <bobdobbs`> surianup: but basically, before debugging js you should make sure that your app is having all of it
[06:22:23] <bobdobbs`> ... all of its dependencies delivered
[06:22:49] <surianup> I don't know ,uch knowledge about jquery
[06:22:52] <walabe> theres "<!--ul class="gallery clearfix">" I'm assuming the !-- is not suppose to be there
[06:22:55] <bobdobbs`> surianup: sure: first make sure that all your dependencies are being delivered. Then look at the behaviour of your page again.
[06:23:27] <bobdobbs`> surianup: then, come up with a clear description of the issue. something more substantial then
[06:23:31] <bobdobbs`> "it's broken"
[06:23:55] <bobdobbs`> Then build a hypothesis of why you are getting unexpected and undesirable behaviour
[06:24:01] <bobdobbs`> then test that hypothesis
[06:24:17] <bobdobbs`> none of that requires programming skill
[06:24:45] <walabe> Why has he got "<!--p>" what's with the "!--" in those tags??
[06:25:04] <Cork> walabe: <!-- -->
[06:25:06] <surianup> it means commented
[06:25:07] <Cork> html comment
[06:25:10] <Tennis> avoid using carousel :) i was once thwarted for it
[06:25:21] <surianup> Hi Cork
[06:25:27] <bobdobbs`> Tennis: owl carousel is pretty good. very flexible
[06:25:47] <surianup> Cork has came here
[06:25:57] <Cork> ?
[06:26:16] <Tennis> depends if you need a slider or not   i suppose. but someone sent me this http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[06:26:42] <surianup> I am using the http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel slider which is working on the other page but I am using this  on differt page which is not working there
[06:26:46] <surianup> Cork
[06:26:49] <walabe> I think sliders are okay for pictures
[06:26:51] <bobdobbs`> Tennis: that's great advice!
[06:27:02] <bobdobbs`> Tennis: use them if they are helpful to the user
[06:27:05] <Cork> surianup: please stop highlighting me over and over again
[06:27:14] <walabe> Anyone got a good forum I can use to ask people to do jquery for me lol??
[06:27:21] <surianup> ok
[06:27:54] <surianup> I know you are genius then all buddy
[06:28:05] <surianup> in this room
[06:28:24] <rickthuc> lol
[06:29:03] <rickthuc> Hello, I am trying to make scrollr work here by stick a div when it reaches in the top of viewport for like 2-3 seconds, and then fade it out, and make the bottom part appear in parallax effect, and then show the footer, I have tried a lot of combinations of codes from their examples, but none seem to work, http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/2/ ?
[06:29:10] <bobdobbs`> walabe: #css-lance
[06:29:32] <bobdobbs`> walabe: or reddit.com/r/forhire
[06:29:39] <walabe> Ehh i didn't really want to pay
[06:30:06] <rickthuc> then do it yourself..
[06:30:09] <bobdobbs`> ^
[06:30:15] <walabe> I can't
[06:30:20] <rickthuc> learn it
[06:30:20] <bobdobbs`> then pay someone
[06:30:27] <rickthuc> no one will work free
[06:30:37] <rickthuc> will you?
[06:30:50] <walabe> yes if it was simple
[06:31:10] <rickthuc> then you should do it is you think its simple..
[06:31:15] <bobdobbs`> walabe: if the work is simple then you can probably figure out how to do it yourself
[06:31:18] <rickthuc> if*
[06:31:22] <rickthuc> ^
[06:31:37] <bobdobbs`> if it isnt simple, then learn it or pay someone
[06:31:49] <rickthuc> whatever you know is simple, if you don't know how to do, its not simple
[06:31:49] <walabe> I don't understand js or jquery, hence why it's hard for me. But if someone who understood it could do it, simple.
[06:32:22] <rickthuc> how do you know its simple
[06:32:33] <rickthuc> what's the issue you are facing
[06:32:39] <bobdobbs`> anyone who has done the hard work to make programming seem simple will most probably want to be compensated for their hard work
[06:32:40] <rickthuc> or what do you want to do
[06:33:19] <bobdobbs`> but the world, and this channel is full of people who will happily help you learn
[06:33:38] <walabe> I need someone to put a jquery gallery into my website, from a like plugin / template thin
[06:33:48] <walabe> I don't understand how to do any of them
[06:33:54] <rickthuc> is it any CMS?
[06:33:57] <bobdobbs`> that's actual labour
[06:34:23] <bobdobbs`> "I need someone to do some engineering work for me. or dig a ditch. I don't want to do it myself. I don't want to pay either"
[06:34:23] <walabe> I don't know what cms is
[06:34:30] <rickthuc> huh
[06:34:38] <rickthuc> are you using Wordpress or anything
[06:34:44] <walabe> No i'm not
[06:34:46] <rickthuc> or is it HTML
[06:34:53] <rickthuc> oh well, then good luck making one...
[06:34:55] <walabe> it's html + css
[06:35:04] <walabe> i'm not making one i'm using someone elses
[06:35:17] <rickthuc> then integrate it the way it has been described
[06:35:21] <rickthuc> there are tones of good ones
[06:35:28] <rickthuc> tons*
[06:35:38] <walabe> Do you have any you recommend? I want a responsive grid styled one
[06:37:13] <rickthuc> i cannot recommend one, since never used it, but you can try it here > http://www.jqueryrain.com/example/jquery-gallery/
[06:37:27] <walabe> thank you
[06:38:18] <rickthuc> there are tons of them with good documentation, examples, just follow them and you can get it up in a couple of hours only, or less...
[06:38:56] <bobdobbs`> walabe: the thing with third-party tools is that you really have to test them before you know if they suit your purposese
[06:39:22] <walabe> Yeah, they always have a tonne of random code that I don't need which confuses me
[06:39:44] <walabe> I think I found a good one thanks
[06:48:16] <bobdobbs`> does anyone here have a workflow wherein you can edit the js and apply it to the dom without reloading the page?
[06:50:28] <bobdobbs`> I'm just curious, cos it disrupts my workflow to have to alter the state of the app
[07:02:05] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: There's "hot swaps" or something, never tried to get it set up though.
[07:03:18] <bobdobbs`> hey BillCriswell
[07:03:41] <bobdobbs`> I won't be setting something up tonight. but I'm guessing that there must be solutions already
[07:04:06] <bobdobbs`> iirc, facebook distributed some tooling for something like this a while back
[07:04:24] <bobdobbs`> oh, found it
[07:04:29] <bobdobbs`> ttps://github.com/facebook/fb-flo
[07:05:35] <charlie_> why is $(".btn").delay(1000).removeClass("invisible"); immediately showing the button?
[07:05:51] <Cork> charlie_: cause .delay only affects animations
[07:06:05] <charlie_> Cork: ah, thanks
[07:06:24] <Cork> charlie_: setTimeout(function() { $(".btn").removeClass("invisible"); }, 1000);
[07:06:38] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: Seems cool. I'd be curious to see how well that works. For UI stuff I can't imagine it being too smooth?
[07:07:03] <charlie_> Cork: thanks a million, stumbling my way though at the min as so new to this
[07:07:32] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: It came out a while ago but I haven't heard much about since. I decided a while back to look at it's uptake before experimenting with it myself.
[07:07:43] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: but I haven't seen it discussed in channels
[07:08:00] <bobdobbs`> "last updated 6 months ago"
[07:08:18] <bobdobbs`> https://facebook.github.io/fb-flo/
[07:08:46] <bobdobbs`> looks like is positioned to compete against a bunch of similar tools. so this kind of tooling is already part of the ecosystem at least
[07:09:48] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: I'm just trying to think how it would handle a module that makes some elements, then one them builds elements on top of that and so on and so on... I might just be thinking about it the wrong way
[07:10:07] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: I don't even know how to start thinking about it
[07:10:20] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah.. That's me reluctance
[07:10:52] <BillCriswell> A router will get me most of the way to what I need usually so a full reload doesn't bother me too much.
[07:14:15] <bobdobbs`> these questions came up for my cos I'm doing something I don't usually do: I'm working on an app with multiple states
[07:14:46] <bobdobbs`> so it'd be nice to edit and reload the js without having to reload the page, and then have to find the state that I was working on again
[07:15:06] <bobdobbs`> There's a neat browser plugin that will do this for CSS
[07:15:34] <NoiseEee> sounds like a use case for a framework like ember, bobdobbs`
[07:16:00] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: Yeah, a router should be able to get you to a specific state
[07:16:17] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: What js framework are you working with / considering?
[07:16:30] <bobdobbs`> ember, eh?
[07:16:51] <bobdobbs`> the next I intend to learn is angular, once version 2 is finalized
[07:17:09] <bobdobbs`> at the moment all I know is some vanilla js, some jquery and some greensock
[07:17:19] <BillCriswell> I tried with angular, just wasn't feeling it.
[07:17:26] <bobdobbs`> heh. same.
[07:17:37] <BillCriswell> I've been using Vue and really dig it: http://vuejs.org/
[07:17:41] <NoiseEee> we've committed to ember here
[07:18:00] <bobdobbs`> but with the app I'm working on at the moment I was building and I thought "I'd love to be able to extend the DOM right now"
[07:18:32] <bobdobbs`> vue...
[07:19:32] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Nice. I tried ember very briefly but I got annoyed quick. It was also a while ago and I'm sure I've learned a lot since then.
[07:20:18] <NoiseEee> its nice and opinionated... if you like that.  strict ways of how to do things, and ember-cli is the bees knees; structures/inits your whole project
[07:20:32] <NoiseEee> get to write es6, etc etc
[07:20:45] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: I'm looking at vue now. is there good tutorial material for it, outside of the primary docs?
[07:20:53] <BillCriswell> Using babel NoiseEee?
[07:21:10] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yep. don't need to set it up or anything either, it just works
[07:22:13] <bobdobbs`> the demo's on the ember page are pretty seductive
[07:23:40] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Does that use browserify or watchify internally?
[07:24:05] <BillCriswell> That's what I'm currently doing with Vue. Using this which I really like: https://github.com/vuejs/vueify
[07:24:23] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: as you're writing it?  i set up https://github.com/facebook/watchman
[07:25:01] <bobdobbs`> pipelines make me nervous
[07:25:10] <bobdobbs`> I don't like debugging them when they go wrong
[07:25:37] <BillCriswell> yes, every time I save a get a new build file with all the css and js
[07:26:37] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: As for a good vue tutorial I'm not sure. The author actually suggested I write small article on it but I'm having a hard time thinking about what to write.
[07:27:40] <pef6000> Hello
[07:29:39] <pef6000> Quick question, if you don't mind. I am using a function in which there is a RequestAnimationFrame, for a canvas animation. How can I call the function to simulate the animation twice ? (or multiple times)
[07:30:08] <decx> huh?
[07:30:18] <decx> requestAnimationFrame is just for the next frame not the full animation ^^
[07:30:26] <pef6000> When doing animate(prop); animate(prop2), it overwrites the first properties with the second one
[07:30:35] <pef6000> Yes
[07:30:46] <pef6000> But, it's more about the function calling
[07:30:55] <decx> you would call it in the callback
[07:31:00] <decx> when it's done
[07:31:16] <pef6000> mmmh
[07:31:21] <pef6000> So
[07:31:56] <pef6000> when calling the function, I call the same function within it ? I'm not sure if I get it right
[07:32:03] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: write "vue.js for bobdobbs"
[07:32:08] <pef6000> (I guess I don't :D)
[07:32:20] <decx> well i have no idea about the specifics
[07:32:22] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: start with links that refresh the reader on MVVM
[07:32:49] <decx> starting a blog now?
[07:32:57] <decx> i thought we were on irc to not have to do that
[07:33:01] <BillCriswell> decx: Asked to write for someone elses lol.
[07:33:10] <decx> tried to start writing about stuff i do for 10 years now
[07:33:19] <decx> always ends in literary disaster
[07:33:23] <pef6000> oh nevermind
[07:33:26] <pef6000> :D
[07:33:26] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: explain where vue fits into the ecosystem, and include a tutorial that isn't too easy, and leaves the reader feelng a little more powerful
[07:33:44] <pef6000> I think I missed something within the function
[07:33:56] <pef6000> Thanks for the help
[07:33:57] <bobdobbs`> BillCriswell: I think that that is the tick to good tuts: having the reader feel more powerful at the end
[07:35:48] <BillCriswell> decx: That's my worry ahah.
[07:36:10] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs`: Thinking of the tutorial is tough haha
[07:37:15] <bobdobbs`> right, it's 2.37AM here. I'm retiring.
[07:37:18] <bobdobbs`> night all!
[07:37:34] <decx> new zealand?
[07:38:17] <tkdaj> Is there a way you can use the shortcut $.post() instead of $.ajax() with processData: false?
[07:38:23] <tkdaj> or setting any other properties?
[07:38:48] <bobdobbs`> decx: yep :)
[07:39:21] <decx> totally guessed that
[07:39:30] <decx> turns out it's either that or the ocean
[07:49:18] <Bjerre_> Is there a way to prevent a button from being pressed within 1 seconds after click?
[07:49:27] <Bjerre_> instead of animating a div overlaying it
[07:49:43] <Cork> Bjerre_: prop('disabled', true)
[07:50:09] <Cork> and setTimeout(function() { prop('disabled', false'); }, 1000);
[07:50:13] <Cork> opps
[07:50:17] <Cork> *and setTimeout(function() { prop('disabled', false); }, 1000);
[07:51:21] <Bjerre_> hmm, so if the buttons that I want to disable during 1 second after press have the class name called .btn where would you put the class?
[07:51:48] <Cork> first of the button you're talking about is a <button> right?
[07:51:55] <Cork> and not just a random element styled as a button?
[07:52:32] <Bjerre_> nah it's not a <button>
[07:52:37] <Bjerre_> second one
[07:52:47] <Cork> ?paste
[07:52:47] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:53:19] <Bjerre_> hard to paste it without adding all the project files atm
[07:53:24] <Bjerre_> but I can give it a try
[07:53:37] <Bjerre_> mind if you dont see any visuals?
[07:53:38] <Cork> only include the html section we're talking about
[07:53:48] <Bjerre_> ok
[07:55:57] <Bjerre_> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/4vzvwggo/8/
[07:56:17] <Es0teric> has anyone here used scrollspy for twitter bootstrap?
[07:56:51] <Bjerre_> Cork if you saw my jquery you would shoot me
[08:01:12] <Bjerre_> Cork: this one is better to look at http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/18/
[08:02:12] <Bjerre_> if you press button 1 and button 2 quick it will not render it as image 2 but instead 1 that is linked to button 1
[08:03:49] <Bjerre_> Uhkis coded another one without the if but that will get messy if you press several buttons repeatedly. The longer fade the more glitchy it gets. Thats why I was wondering if you can disable the buttons during the same amount of time that the fade takes to end
[08:11:37] <Bjerre> Cork you here?
[08:12:05] <Cork> sure
[08:12:56] <Bjerre> did you see my post?
[08:13:16] <Cork> uh
[08:13:16] <Bjerre> I managed to quit chrome so didnt see if you replied
[08:13:31] <Cork> not sure what the question was about
[08:15:19] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/19/ If you press the buttons it will show an image. Everything works great if you're slow on clicking the buttons. However, if you press it fast (button 1 then quick button 2) it will show the wrong image
[08:15:54] <Bjerre> so I wanted something that delays pressing on the buttons.
[08:16:12] <decx> disable clicks until your callback
[08:16:28] <Bjerre> that sounds good decx
[08:16:44] <Bjerre> any idea on how to do that?
[08:17:10] <decx> either with the disabled property or you can keep track of state yourself
[08:17:21] <Bjerre> hmm ok
[08:17:26] <hlvwrk> Heyooooooo.
[08:17:34] <Bjerre> hi hlvwrk
[08:17:52] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/k6LaLtam/ Why isn't the html updating correctly?
[08:18:15] <hlvwrk> It should output Special6, but doesn't output
[08:18:30] <decx> b isnt the element but a new element with just the html
[08:18:33] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/k6LaLtam/1/
[08:18:35] <decx> lose the html() in your selector
[08:18:37] <Bjerre> :E
[08:18:56] <hlvwrk> :3
[08:19:15] <hlvwrk> Bjerre everything poofed!
[08:19:23] <Bjerre> yup :)
[08:19:47] <hlvwrk> decx didn't change anything
[08:19:54] <Bjerre> decx I need your help :/
[08:19:59] <taplar> Bjerre: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/21/
[08:20:17] <hlvwrk> oh wait.
[08:20:32] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/k6LaLtam/3/
[08:20:37] <hlvwrk> Got it
[08:20:39] <hlvwrk> thanks
[08:20:39] <hlvwrk> <3
[08:21:19] <Bjerre> taplar that works but the crossfade is not working as intended (go from one picture to another)
[08:21:41] <Bjerre> thanks though you're awesome
[08:22:28] <decx> Bjerre: i'd say rewrite the whole thing
[08:22:41] <Bjerre> really?
[08:23:01] <decx> urls in 4 places, hardcoded amount
[08:23:04] <decx> yeah
[08:23:09] <decx> that's not maintainable
[08:23:34] <Bjerre> there will be maximum of 8
[08:23:49] <decx> so button1 and button2 are probably gonna be next and prev
[08:23:57] <Bjerre> nope
[08:24:03] <Bjerre> 1 button for each img
[08:24:04] <decx> so button for every slide?
[08:24:07] <Bjerre> 8 in total
[08:24:33] <nadav> Hey guys, any idea how to solve two different javascript files conflicting?
[08:24:36] <Bjerre> the buttons have several functions. One is to scale text, one is to change text and one is to change image
[08:25:04] <nadav> when I import some library, it seem to overrun other functions thus rendering some of the features uselssl
[08:25:15] <Bjerre> yes decx 1 button for each slide
[08:26:01] <Bjerre> Im just gonna animate an overlaying div to avoid it being clickable
[08:26:10] <Bjerre> seems like an idiotic plan though
[08:28:18] <Bjerre> perhaps you use the same variables in the two files nadav
[08:28:39] <nadav> any way to find conflicts between two java files?
[08:36:33] <Bjerre> hmm this is a struggle
[08:37:26] <Bjerre> there must be an easy way to deactivate click and keys when fired and add a timeout on 1 sec
[08:37:42] <decx> there is
[08:38:05] <decx> i'm mean and will just leave it at that :)
[08:38:10] <new0> hi all, does someone know how to implement marquee with good plugin? the URL should response with XML
[08:38:14] <Bjerre> ye you're mean :)
[08:38:34] <Bjerre> Im thinking on threex.keyboardstate
[08:38:42] <Bjerre> am I on the correct path decx?
[08:39:18] <Bjerre> or is that overkill
[08:41:16] <Bjerre> ok might have found a solution
[08:45:22] <decx> that's not just overkill
[08:45:41] <decx> that's dropping a nuke on japanese cities when you've already won the war
[08:47:19] <decx> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/23/
[08:48:55] <Bjerre> decx I love you
[08:49:03] <Bjerre> I tried myself and didnt see you posted
[08:49:05] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/24/
[08:49:13] <decx> you'll have to tweak the conditional but that'll do
[08:49:13] <Bjerre> managed to disable the one that I clicked
[08:49:25] <Bjerre> the one you did is flawless
[08:49:34] <Bjerre> thank you!
[08:49:34] <decx> use prop()
[08:53:10] <Bjerre> decx got some conflict with the other javascript :/
[08:53:40] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/25/
[08:54:32] <Bjerre> didnt add the proper html and css for it but it's probably conflicting since I use the function twice
[08:54:48] <decx> doesnt matter
[08:55:06] <decx> this isn't onevent = function so you're not overriding stuff
[08:55:43] <Bjerre> the thing is that the button itself (span class in the project) is not clickable but the image loads anyway
[09:01:19] <nadav> I have a problem where jquery is trying to execute a jQuery.browser command and it wont work :( any ideas? it forces me to use old jquery but that messes up other poritons of my site
[09:02:05] <MajorTennis> hey i just got slaughtered for anti patterns in #javascript
[09:02:14] <MajorTennis> so i'm going to try and be sudo with my question here
[09:02:33] <MajorTennis> can i put a javscript variable inside the href attribute of my <a> tag ? :)
[09:03:16] <decx> wat?
[09:05:45] <taplar> good lord i dislike long retrospectives
[09:06:24] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: What was said in #javascript is still the right answer. Use JS events to bind to the click. The href attribute was never intended to house JS.
[09:07:01] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: It's going to take you longer to find someone willing to teach you how to do things incorrectly than to just learn how to bind to click events (which jQuery makes really easy)
[09:07:21] <taplar> MajorTennis: keep your business logic separate from your markup.  separation of responsibilities
[09:08:26] <MajorTennis> marc
[09:08:33] <MajorTennis> i didnt ask how to reformat my click
[09:08:50] <MajorTennis> i dont want anyone to teach me anything right now
[09:08:57] <MajorTennis> why do people make so many assumptions
[09:09:02] <MajorTennis> and have to be so snarky
[09:09:56] <taplar> ....you asked how to do something... so your asking to be taught something...... ?
[09:10:10] <abcd22> say, in a  hash based navigation, the user can navigate to /#editProfile which will open a screen where he can edit his profile. When the user closes the "edit profile" screen, I want to remove the "/#editProfile". How should I go about that?
[09:10:28] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: What assumptions are being made? You're attempting to do something that is very poor practice, and is pretty much guaranteed to cause problems down the line. We on IRC are taking our own time to give you /free help/, and you're telling us we're helping you wrong.
[09:10:53] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: And attempting to save you headaches down the line, I might add.
[09:11:03] <MajorTennis> you're assuming I don't know alternative ways of handling click events
[09:11:07] <MajorTennis> you're assuming i wrote that code
[09:11:14] <decx> abcd22:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[09:11:45] <decx> history.pushState or one of the other similar things
[09:11:54] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: "Hey guiz , could you help me put a javascript value inside my attribute for a html tag :) . heres my code:"
[09:11:56] <marc_v92> "My code"
[09:11:58] <marc_v92> No assumption being made.
[09:12:10] <MajorTennis> Ok you phrase your intentions better than I interpret them.
[09:12:15] <MajorTennis> because ive been in here before
[09:12:19] <new0> is there a guide for buidling RSS Feed scrolling?
[09:12:20] <MajorTennis> and if i didnt give any code
[09:12:28] <MajorTennis> someone would have said show us some code
[09:12:54] <abcd22> decx: Thx, but what's the usual solution, history.replaceState()?
[09:13:04] <abcd22> decx: I am rather looking for best practises
[09:13:14] <decx> they are still being carved out i guess
[09:13:37] <decx> replace wont add a new entry in the users history
[09:14:08] <decx> but all this could be pointless if you have a hash based nav
[09:14:31] <decx> removing window.location.hash might be all you need
[09:14:49] <abcd22> decx: you mean clearing the object?
[09:14:58] <decx> not sure
[09:14:59] <decx> ^^
[09:16:05] <abcd22> lol, thanks anyways. I will figure it out
[09:16:10] <MajorTennis> okay marc_v92 i'm not missinterpreting
[09:16:29] <MajorTennis> its total hostility i receive from you , pls don't respond if you don't have anything nice to say
[09:17:03] <MajorTennis> good day
[09:17:07] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: Oh, sorry, did I not respond to you fast enough? Next time, I'll drop the work that I'm paid to do and immediately help you implement poor practices into your code. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. :)
[09:17:16] <MajorTennis> i said good day
[09:17:18] <decx> i havent seen any hostility until now
[09:17:27] <MajorTennis> marc_v92,  i said dont respond
[09:17:32] <decx> only a weird question with no follow up aside from bickering :(
[09:17:38] <taplar> time to let it go
[09:17:53] <MajorTennis> adament that the response i received in another channel is "still the right answer"
[09:18:00] <MajorTennis> my question wasn't answered in that channel
[09:18:08] <MajorTennis> stating that i need to be taught the correct methods
[09:18:26] <MajorTennis> don't NEED to do anything
[09:20:28] <marc_v92> MajorTennis: On a serious note, when asking for free help, it's pretty rude to get upset when people don't help you the way you want. I'm not the only one encouraging you to rewrite your code. I sincerely apologize for that last outburst, but I stand by the rest of what I said. I don't appreciate the private messages you're now sending, either. Best of luck solving your issue, and I mean that sincerely.
[09:21:39] <MajorTennis> im not being rude this is all text based chat
[09:21:45] <MajorTennis> I wasnt asking for "free help"
[09:21:51] <MajorTennis> i was just posing a question in a chat room
[09:23:03] <decx> with no follow up at all
[09:23:12] <decx> "can i put a javscript variable inside the href attribute of my <a> tag " followed by paragraphs of bickering
[09:23:14] <decx> i mean come on
[09:25:18] <hlvwrk> Can you .append multiple items? test.append(a1, b2, c3) ?
[09:25:36] <decx> append([a1,b2,c3])
[09:25:51] <hlvwrk> thanks
[09:26:01] <decx> it has a built in loop to deal with collection and by extension arrays
[09:26:08] <workerbeetwo> MajorTennis: is your issue solved now?
[09:26:32] <MajorTennis> decx you could mute me , i have gotten worked up in here before
[09:26:32] <taplar> can I get some clarification?  by "inside the href", what does this mean?  variable reference in the href, or are we talking about append the key=value pair to it?
[09:27:05] <MajorTennis> and i appologise to the crowd for spamming the room with my nonsense, i'm sorry
[09:27:32] <MajorTennis> taplar i have href='gogle.co.uk/123/'
[09:27:50] <MajorTennis> and where javascript variable is := dtit
[09:28:12] <MajorTennis> href='gogle.co.uk/dtit' is what i'm after
[09:28:58] <taplar> dtit is the variable, or the literal value?
[09:28:58] <decx> i dont get it
[09:29:08] <decx> 123 should be replaced?
[09:29:12] <gerep> I'm trying to use .on("focus") on an element: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/065dfbe589bf8ff5c068
[09:29:27] <gerep> The elements will be added when the user clicks on a button
[09:29:37] <gerep> All those elements have a different id but the same class
[09:29:51] <decx> find the closest static parent and delegate from there
[09:29:53] <workerbeetwo> MajorTennis: perhaps you mean href='gogle.co.ok/' + dtit    ? where dtit holds the value 123?
[09:29:56] <gerep> It works only for the first one that is already loaded, the ones added doesn't receive the mask
[09:29:59] <decx> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:30:11] <MajorTennis> yeah workerbeer that sounds right
[09:30:30] <gerep> decx, I don't get it
[09:30:36] <gerep> decx, what's wrong with my code?
[09:30:41] <decx> read that page gerep
[09:30:44] <decx> you'll see
[09:31:13] <gerep> decx, Ah! I see! Thanks a lot ;)
[09:31:18] <taplar> you can use .prop('href', 'newvalue') or .attr('href', 'new value') to change the href
[09:31:26] <taplar> however you derive the new value
[09:33:33] <workerbeetwo> MajorTennis: ok then it depends on how you like procude/inject the code I assume it this way $('#myelem').add(' <a href="gogle.co.uk/ ' + dtit + '" > linktext</a>' );
[09:34:14] <MajorTennis> yeah workerbee that totally works and is what i was trying to do
[09:34:27] <MajorTennis> i know i should use jquery for my onclick event
[09:34:41] <MajorTennis> infact tomorrow i will just to be of higher standards
[09:35:02] <taplar> i think the confusion was just from the question.  assumptions were being made
[09:35:57] <zlude> Hey! Someone can help me? http://i.imgur.com/VmdbBCZ.png I've tried "json['PlayerInfo']['name']", but I get error.. I'm confused to this objects with 'real data'
[09:36:20] <zlude> json['PlayerInfo']['Name']*
[09:36:26] <Bjerre> decx why isn't it working? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/27/
[09:36:47] <taplar> PlayerInfo is a child of Anto
[09:36:58] <taplar> from that picture
[09:37:16] <decx> only input elements can be disabled Bjerre
[09:37:29] <Bjerre> oh for christ sake
[09:37:50] <taplar> json.Anto.PlayerInfo.Name
[09:37:56] <zlude> Bjerre, remove comment lines
[09:38:30] <Bjerre> zlude: the commented lines are not used anyway. Only in the real project they have a function
[09:38:56] <zlude> Bjerre, they are causing bug to jsfiddle, try.
[09:39:17] <Bjerre> facepalm
[09:40:40] <zlude> taplar, But I don't know object "Anto" I want to get all the entries from this json and display all players name in a table ..
[09:40:56] <zlude> Bjerre, I remove commented lines and it works
[09:41:33] <taplar> zlude: is that json in flux?  you might want to return your PlayerInfo elements in an array in that case
[09:41:50] <taplar> rather than each a value of a map key
[09:42:02] <Bjerre> zlude: ye it did, thanks.
[09:42:18] <Bjerre> the facepalm was for my mistake zlude
[09:43:23] <zlude> taplar, all right..
[09:48:07] <Bjerre> server split? :E
[09:49:20] <Bjerre> anyway, I have added the css and some of the html to show you the problem that I have in my project. What happens is that you have to click on the button twice in order to show the image, but the animation on the button itself is starting regardless. Any idea on how to fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/29/
[09:49:33] <taplar> zlude: otherwise if it is a requirement that your json be in that structure for other purposes, you could iterate over the children elements with a for in loop: http://jsfiddle.net/fzv7kmsz/
[09:49:56] <taplar> but if it is not a requirement, i would recommend changing the structure
[09:51:05] <Bjerre> actually, three times in order to play the button animation. The image itself also glitching
[09:52:48] <notchris> Is there an easy way to see all available arrays / variables on a specific page
[09:52:49] <EllisTAA> anyone know an eventlistener like on click but for when i push a button like ‘x’ or ‘enter’?
[09:52:58] <Bjerre> anyone? :(
[09:53:25] <rickthuc> anyone familiar with scrollr here? am trying to make a basic animation, but its just not even close to it, tried for a couple of hours on this and more sigh http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/2/ its a very basic animation
[09:54:10] <zlude> taplar, thank you! i've changed my json output to have 'key:value', now that's working. thx again.
[09:54:19] <taplar> zlude: good deal
[09:54:39] <taplar> Bjerre: looking at it
[09:54:48] <Bjerre> awesome taplar
[09:55:40] <monk3y> Bjerre: not a solution, but why does your code look for .data('target'), when the attribute you use is data-img?
[09:56:03] <Bjerre> monk3y I didn't add the data target in the html
[09:56:11] <Bjerre> monk3y: can that be causing some problems?
[09:57:04] <Bjerre> the data-target is in my projectfile but the same situation is occuring there
[09:59:04] <dopie> hey all
[09:59:30] <Bjerre> hello dopie
[09:59:32] <dopie> if i have a select box and would like to change a div to another div when i select a different selection how would i accomplish this?
[10:00:02] <rickthuc> on select change
[10:01:16] <rickthuc> $('#select').on('change', function() { alert( this.value ); });
[10:07:45] <Bjerre> taplar found anything?
[10:15:38] <Bjerre> taplar: I'm going now but will be back in an hour. I'll mess you when I'm back if you're still here.
[10:17:33] <taplar> fixing to take lunch myself
[10:31:47] <HugoL> My project manager drives me crazy.. He is paranoid. I never understand what he really wants..
[10:32:49] <HugoL> I ask him something and don't get any answer ..
[10:33:14] <arc_> is this just a problem in chrome or what
[10:33:23] <arc_> where the font rendering changes while elements are animating
[10:33:30] <arc_> even if the text is not what is animating
[10:33:55] <arc_> see the red text here http://cpucores.com/
[10:40:42] <Uhkis> arc_: where's the animation?
[10:42:23] <arc_> there's a carousel in the grey section below the blue section
[10:42:30] <Bjerre> Hello again guys
[10:42:52] <arc_> but the text that changes during the animation is the red text in the blue section
[10:44:04] <arc_> btw i'm not asking for help to fix this problem, it's not my site :p
[10:44:09] <arc_> it was just something i noticed
[10:44:35] <gifty> need help with dynatables
[10:44:49] <gifty> can anyone here help me. please
[10:45:57] <taplar> Bjerre: when you get back, see what you think of this: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/34/
[10:46:57] <taplar> !ask
[10:46:57] <b-ot> taplar: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:47:05] <taplar> ^ gifty
[10:49:06] <Uhkis> someone mangled my smooth image crossfade
[10:49:13] <taplar> :D
[10:50:45] <Bjerre> haha Uhkis :D Thank you so much taplar (and ofcourse Uhkis). The button lockdown works splendid! But as Uhkis said, the xfade is not correct.
[10:51:04] <Bjerre> it works great though
[10:51:09] <taplar> 50% isn't bad, ^_^
[10:51:19] <Bjerre> haha it's awesome mate
[10:52:01] <Bjerre> you're so kind helping me out
[10:52:22] <Bjerre> I wish I could help you in some way
[10:52:39] <taplar> pay it forward, ;)
[10:53:17] <Bjerre> If I had money you mean
[10:53:32] <taplar> eh, it's just a saying
[10:53:45] <Bjerre> silly me
[10:54:24] <Bjerre> Uhkis: got any idea on how to bring back your awesome xfade?
[10:54:53] <Uhkis> ill check in a sec
[10:55:12] <taplar> what was the xfade effect?
[10:55:42] <taplar> all i could see of the next image on my side was a tiiiiiiny little sliver on the lhs of the panel
[10:56:02] <Bjerre> sliver?
[10:56:13] <taplar> was barely on the screen
[10:56:31] <diegoviola> hi
[10:56:34] <Bjerre> oh ok
[10:56:35] <taplar> i cold only see like maybe 5-10 pixels of it's rhs
[10:56:39] <taplar> ^could
[10:56:43] <morlenxus> Hey guys, how can have a button which creates on every click a new dialog window with jqueryui?
[10:56:47] <Bjerre> you're on a 8k monitor?
[10:56:50] <Bjerre> :E
[10:56:57] <taplar> um
[10:57:03] <Bjerre> probably my html that fucked it up
[10:57:05] <taplar> i believe i'm on 1366x768
[10:57:17] <Bjerre> css"
[10:57:49] <diegoviola> any ideas how to improve/refactor this ajax code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/81744ba1a8359c638855
[10:57:55] <Bjerre> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/13/
[10:57:59] <Bjerre> here is how it should look
[10:58:03] <Bjerre> with the transition
[10:58:08] <Bjerre> the code was made by Uhkis
[10:58:46] <Bjerre> but as you can see it glitches when you are fast on the buttons
[10:58:53] <taplar> ah
[10:58:55] <Bjerre> which your code helped out with
[10:59:26] <dopie> Bjerre, how would i tell onchange to change on a specific value like foo
[10:59:42] <dopie> $('#emergency_contact_contact_method').on('change', function() {
[10:59:42] <dopie>   alert( this.value );
[10:59:43] <dopie> });
[11:00:10] <dopie> if value === 'foo' change x
[11:00:53] <EricBB> If 	  if (interval != 'undefined') { clearInterval(interval); } keeps giving me the error "interval is not defined" what am I not doing correctly?
[11:00:59] <Bjerre> dopie: I would ask somebody else, I'm really new to jquery/javascript. Do you have jsfiddle so we can try it out?
[11:01:44] <Bjerre> EricBB: is interval a variable? I'm not sure but shouldnt it be with capital i otherwise?
[11:01:57] <EricBB> it is a variable
[11:02:28] <Bjerre> var interval = what?
[11:02:35] <EricBB> interval = setInterval(myfunction,3000);
[11:02:35] <Bjerre> ?paste
[11:02:35] <b-ot> Bjerre: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:04:38] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/r3fg3quf/2/
[11:04:47] <dopie> basically when i change the contact method to email
[11:04:54] <dopie> I want the first box to disappear
[11:05:00] <dopie> and then show the 2nd box
[11:06:39] <Bjerre> ah ok so you want info to show instead?
[11:07:10] <dopie> yes
[11:07:10] <Bjerre> or you want to remove the selection?
[11:07:22] <taplar> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net/r3fg3quf/3/ possibly
[11:07:50] <dopie> taplar, that hides the method as well
[11:08:13] <EricBB> dopie: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/r3fg3quf/4/
[11:08:15] <taplar> you want the selection to day?
[11:08:18] <taplar> to stay
[11:08:20] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/35/
[11:08:26] <dopie> yes
[11:08:54] <dopie> I want contact method to stay and to disable the input of the input box that is hidden

[11:09:26] <EricBB> can anybody tell me why if (variable !='undefined') would give the error "variable is not defined" (in regard to my comment at 13:00)
[11:09:39] <Bjerre> Uhkis: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It works like a charm. You're fucking great
[11:09:46] <Bjerre> sorry to swear but it was needed
[11:09:52] <Uhkis> :D
[11:09:52] <Bjerre> thank you <3<3
[11:09:57] <taplar> EricBB: try if (typeof variable !== 'undefined')
[11:10:08] <dopie> contact info should be hidden on start
[11:10:34] <Bjerre> this is awesome Uhkis
[11:10:41] <Bjerre> thank you Uhkis and taplar

[11:12:36] <dopie> yep
[11:12:42] <dopie> ok i updated yours
[11:12:46] <dopie> its not changing
[11:13:01] <Bjerre> 13:00 EricBB. It's 20:00 here :( Where you live?
[11:13:08] <taplar> dopie: what /# ?
[11:13:14] <Uhkis> omg, have i been helping a swede?! :D

[11:13:25] <dopie> change the contact method
[11:13:32] <Bjerre> oh no, is that bad? :(
[11:13:33] <dopie> it doesn't change the place holder
[11:14:26] <taplar> oh, you want the place holder to be email?
[11:14:41] <HugoL> Has anyone experience with fineuploader?
[11:14:44] <taplar> or just whatever the value of the select is?
[11:14:54] <EricBB> Bjerre Texas :)
[11:15:10] <Bjerre> Uhkis: Janne!
[11:15:21] <Bjerre> howdi sir EricBB
[11:15:21] <Uhkis> Bjerre: just kidding of course :)
[11:15:28] <Bjerre> :D
[11:15:37] <EricBB> Bjerre lol howdy
[11:16:08] <Uhkis> Bjerre: what about my name?
[11:16:33] <Bjerre> Well it sounds swedish as well :)
[11:16:50] <taplar> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net/r3fg3quf/16/
[11:16:52] <Uhkis> isn't jan the swedish version of janne
[11:17:28] <Bjerre> yea it is but I call my friend Janne (whos name obviously is jan)
[11:17:39] <Uhkis> imposter! :D
[11:17:42] <Bjerre> hahaha
[11:17:47] <Bjerre> I'll tell him
[11:18:03] <dopie> taplar, i also have to disable the input boxes
[11:18:13] <dopie> or else they get submitted when they are hidden
[11:18:54] <catuca> I am completely puzzled by this issue. Please look at this jsfiddle at https://jsfiddle.net/7g47xw2t/. Clicking on any of the X images should remove the entry from the screen. It works well for a couple, then doesnt do anything for the others. no console errors, nothing. If I reload the page, then I can delete everyone of those entries. why is that?
[11:19:36] <taplar> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net/r3fg3quf/17/
[11:20:11] <Uhkis> catuca: paste the version rendered by the browser, not the .php file
[11:20:20] <catuca> Uhkis, k
[11:20:40] <catuca> Uhkis, you have it with that fiddle
[11:20:47] <dopie> why is it doing some gay animation?
[11:20:52] <catuca> Uhkis, it is in the HTML section
[11:21:07] <Uhkis> catuca: the js is still filled with php
[11:21:08] <dopie> taper still wrong
[11:21:13] <dopie> taplar, still wrong
[11:21:24] <taplar> dopie: what's left?
[11:21:25] <dopie> when you select SMS everything disappears
[11:21:36] <dopie> contanct info disappears
[11:21:41] <catuca> Uhkis, k
[11:21:49] <taplar> so should only the input disappear, but the label remain?
[11:21:55] <dopie> no
[11:21:58] <dopie> you're not getting it
[11:22:11] <dopie> let me explain the scope of what is needed or what I'm trying to do
[11:22:15] <taplar> k
[11:22:36] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/r3fg3quf/18/
[11:22:44] <Bjerre> except that you dont want it blocked right?
[11:22:48] <Bjerre> e.g disabled
[11:23:07] <dopie> yes!!
[11:23:11] <taplar> Bj for the win
[11:23:19] <Uhkis> LOL
[11:23:24] <catuca> Uhkis, https://jsfiddle.net/7g47xw2t/1/
[11:23:38] <dopie> Bjerre, i want the one which is hidden to be disabled
[11:23:40] <catuca> Uhkis, that is straight from Firebug->Script
[11:23:43] <taplar> V_V i clearly read the desire for elements to be hidden... *cries in a corner*
[11:24:17] <Uhkis> catuca: so.. what's not working?
[11:24:27] <Bjerre> well dopie let taplar handle that, I'm done.... *flies off celebrating that he removed a line of code
[11:24:38] <taplar> lol
[11:24:42] <Uhkis> catuca: i was able to remove all of those
[11:25:41] <catuca> Uhkis, When you click on the x.png, it removes it from the screen. It does that for some and not others. If I reload the page, it lets me delete all
[11:26:03] <Uhkis> catuca: worked fine for all here, firefox 38.0.5
[11:26:40] <Bjerre> Uhkis: is it possible to bind left and right arrow to move between buttons?
[11:26:43] <catuca> Uhkis, wait a minute...when I add more and then try to delete..it fails...you need more info then
[11:27:21] <Uhkis> catuca: ah, then you need to bind the event to already existing element on the page
[11:27:58] <catuca> Uhkis, hummmmm
[11:28:02] <Bjerre> I've heard of threex.keyboardstate.js, anything you can recommend?
[11:28:05] <catuca> Uhkis, could you give me an example of how to do that
[11:28:17] <Uhkis> catuca: like: $('#videos-page-videos').on('click', '.remove-video', function() { .. });
[11:28:39] <catuca> Uhkis, but what is the difference between click and onclick then?
[11:29:05] <Uhkis> catuca: .click() only works on elements that already exist when the event handler is created
[11:29:35] <catuca> Uhkis, puff...okay
[11:29:52] <taplar> what's the magic command.... ?jquery delegate
[11:29:57] <taplar> !jquery delegate
[11:30:00] <Uhkis> ?api delegate
[11:30:00] <b-ot> Uhkis: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:30:00] <taplar> !commands
[11:30:04] <taplar> bah
[11:30:05] <b-ot> taplar: http://bot-t.com/docs/
[11:30:34] <Uhkis> Bjerre: of course it's possible
[11:31:51] <Bjerre> in my mind I see how it could work but for some reason I feel that it will be really messy if you go right arrow to next button but then skip two buttons and use mouse click
[11:32:02] <Uhkis> Bjerre: i'd just use .on('keydown'
[11:32:06] <catuca> Uhkis, I can't do videos-page-videos...I got 3 different sections
[11:32:36] <Uhkis> catuca: well you need to find a parent that's already there when the page is rendered for the first time
[11:33:03] <Bjerre> I see Uhkis
[11:33:11] <taplar> try to avoid body, ;)
[11:33:49] <Bjerre> who me taplar?
[11:33:59] <catuca> Uhkis, okay
[11:34:01] <Bjerre> I like body :(
[11:34:03] <taplar> catuca and his delegates
[11:34:08] <Bjerre> ye I see
[11:34:37] <Bjerre> "catuca and his delegates" in the cinema 2016
[11:34:57] <catuca> videos-
[11:35:03] <catuca> sorry
[11:35:20] <taplar> heh, a diplomatic mission..... to save the world!
[11:35:33] <Bjerre> it sounds more like a book title though
[11:35:37] <R13ose> I am trying to convert my code which is using youtube api v2 to v3 but unsure how to do that.  Code: http://pastebin.com/LZhJNvdU  Would someone be able to help me?
[11:36:26] <Uhkis> so you're from here!
[11:37:35] <Bjerre> Uhkis: who?
[11:37:44] <catuca> Uhkis, it now works
[11:38:30] <catuca> Uhkis, explain to me the difference between this: $('#wpbody-content').on('click', '.remove-video', function()  and $('.remove-video').on('click', function()
[11:39:00] <Bjerre> catuca two different divs that you click on
[11:39:04] <taplar> catuca: the second is a direct binding
[11:39:16] <taplar> catuca: the wpbody itself, has the event handler
[11:39:17] <Uhkis> Bjerre: R13ose has been pm'ing me for a few times just saying "hi"
[11:39:26] <Bjerre> hahaha
[11:39:28] <catuca> ah k
[11:39:30] <Bjerre> fanboy
[11:39:39] <Bjerre> now we're 2 :D
[11:39:40] <R13ose> Uhkis: okay and?
[11:39:40] <taplar> catuca: this means when you attempted to bind it, the wpbody had to already exist
[11:40:10] <taplar> crap
[11:40:17] <taplar> catuca: the second one actually binds on the remove-video
[11:40:33] <taplar> catuca: swap out wpbody with remove-video and it's true
[11:40:40] <Uhkis> catuca: first one selects the element and then searches for children with class remove-video "live", latter one selects remove-video classed elements and is done
[11:41:04] <Uhkis> iirc it's explained better in the delegate api page
[11:41:09] <taplar> yeah
[11:41:44] <Uhkis> ?api delegate @ catuca
[11:41:44] <b-ot> catuca: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:41:51] <catuca> Uhkis, k
[11:41:58] <taplar> boiled down though, delegates interrogate events that bubble up to them to see if they originated from a child element matching a selector.  if they do, they apply the handler against them
[11:42:00] <Uhkis> "or in the future" being the point
[11:44:12] <catuca> Uhkis, well thank you
[11:44:19] <Uhkis> np!
[11:45:56] <rickthuc> I am trying to stick a div in the viewport for like 2-3 seconds, and then fade it out and make the bottom part scroll up with parallax effect and then show the footer, I have tried to use scrollr for this, but I am not able to make it work. I am confused about the "data" part. http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/2/
[11:47:56] <Bjerre> Uhkis: If I want to keep the textanimation and textforward classes as well as #textHolder and #headHolder in the code you gave me, what would be the best way to implement it in the code provided? The ones that I'm talking about are in the commented section. Is it easy enough to just add them straight in, below line 25? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/36/
[11:48:21] <Bjerre> I dont have the project in front of me right now Uhkis so thats why I ask before try if that makes sence
[11:48:23] <Bjerre> sense"
[11:48:56] <Bjerre> I guess it's just to move them
[11:49:17] <Bjerre> hard for you to see since there is nothing in the html that show em
[11:50:05] <Uhkis> Bjerre: you may wanna use .text() instead
[11:51:03] <Bjerre> how come?
[11:51:20] <boxatom> Hi!  I need help with something….  I am trying to remove all except some options from a select….   im trying something like…    $(“#theIDofSelect option not:1,not:5”).remove()  <— obvously dont expect it to work, but is there some syntax that might make it work?
[11:51:45] <Uhkis> Bjerre: it's just text you're adding, right?
[11:52:01] <Bjerre> yes from the span text-data
[11:52:35] <Bjerre> it was working before but I assume it wont after the changes since it's commented
[11:52:47] <Bjerre> or I am 100%  sure :)
[11:52:56] <taplar> boxatom: what are '1' and '5' ?  values, position?
[11:53:00] <Bjerre> Im gonna add to the html, give me a minute or two
[11:53:07] <boxatom> mmm they are suposed to be values
[11:53:19] <taplar> do a custom filter then
[11:53:53] <taplar> $(“#theIDofSelect option”).filter(function(){  return this.value !== 1 && this.value !== 5; })
[11:54:22] <boxatom> that line of code looks beautifull :D
[11:55:47] <taplar> $(“#theIDofSelect option”).filter(function(){  return [1, 5].indexOf(this.value) < 0; })
[11:55:50] <taplar> fancy
[11:57:34] <decx> indexOf for multichecks is indeed nice
[11:59:40] <boxatom> that worked perfectly, i wish I understood the logic of it, but glad it works….
[12:00:19] <taplar> what's got you confused?
[12:00:51] <Bjerre> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/37/
[12:01:00] <boxatom>  return [1, 5].indexOf(this.value) < 0; })
[12:01:13] <taplar> [1, 5] is a javascript array
[12:01:23] <taplar> it tries to find the value of the option in the array
[12:01:24] <Bjerre> oh, forgot textanimation one
[12:01:34] <taplar> if a value does not exist in an array, indexOf returns -1
[12:01:51] <taplar> so, if you want to exclude 1, and 5, you want where the value returns -1
[12:02:03] <boxatom> so it creates an array, and evaluates if its on this value?
[12:02:13] <taplar> if the value is in the array
[12:03:46] <taplar> well, to be more specific, it returns the index of the value, if it exists
[12:04:00] <taplar> with that array, indexOf(1) would be 0, and indexOf(5) would be 1
[12:04:15] <taplar> otherwise not found, -1
[12:04:17] <Bjerre> it should be something like this Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/38/
[12:05:15] <boxatom> ok, now i get it…
[12:06:28] <boxatom> how could i ever repay you
[12:06:48] <taplar> find me a beautiful woman with low expectations
[12:07:31] <boxatom> :D   i could arrange that
[12:13:42] <Bjerre> boxatom: give him a fleshlight and he's happy
[12:14:05] <taplar> woah
[12:14:10] <Bjerre> :E
[12:15:14] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/40/ ?
[12:16:10] <boxatom> Auto Blow 2
[12:17:08] <taplar> what was wrong with #1?
[12:18:20] <Bjerre> I have no idea on how that worked for you and not for me Uhkis
[12:18:32] <Bjerre> I did the exact same thing
[12:18:48] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/41/
[12:18:59] <Bjerre> except that I have the animations for text which is not working either

[12:27:18] <R13ose> Seems no one could help me with my question?
[12:27:28] <Bjerre> I dont remember what the target should be, or do you mean I can have anything in it? tried that and nothing happend Uhkis

[12:34:09] <hydraidm801> how can I get the month of <th colspan="7" class="month">June 2015</th> ??
[12:35:12] <taplar> hydraidm801:  split the .text() of that variable on ' ' and take element [0]
[12:36:25] <hydraidm801> but what is the selector?
[12:36:36] <taplar> '.month'
[12:38:27] <hydraidm801> $(".month").text().split(' ') ??
[12:38:43] <taplar> ure
[12:38:45] <taplar> sure
[12:39:14] <taplar> should return ["June", "2015"]
[12:40:47] <hydraidm801> k that should work. Now I just have to figure out how to pass that to python's datetime as an int
[12:41:04] <taplar> the month?
[12:42:26] <hydraidm801> yeah so June as 6 July as 7 ect
[12:42:37] <taplar> an options would be var monthMapper = [ "January", "Febuary", "March", ... ]; and then use var month = monthMapper.indexOf("June") + 1;
[12:42:39] <hydraidm801> I guess I should do month and year
[12:43:46] <hydraidm801> that works
[12:44:22] <taplar> though I wonder if there is a way you could do it with Date()
[12:45:44] <rickthuc> I am trying to stick a div in the viewport for like 2-3 seconds, and then fade it out and make the bottom part scroll up with parallax effect and then show the footer, I have tried to use scrollr for this, but I am not able to make it work.

[12:50:04] <hydraidm801> this is a django app I've written for users it's 98% done. It's like Django-Happenings but with user support

[15:18:45] <Phoenixz> Is there any reason why a $("form").submit() would not submit a form, while if I do $("submitbuttoninform").trigger("click"); does submit without problem?
[15:25:34] <Phoenixz> I'm right now in google chrome web console doing $("idoftheform").submit(); and nothing happens at all, it should submit the form though
[15:35:07] <monk3y> Phoenixz: Are you missing the '#'? $("#idoftheform")?
[15:35:43] <Phoenixz> monk3y: Nop, $("#listing").submit();
[15:37:04] <Phoenixz> monk3y: In fact, chrome shows me the form HTML in return of that, so I know it can find it, it just doesn't submit
[15:58:33] <monk3y> Phoenixz: are there any errors in the console?  And is the action set on the form?  And could there be any other JS listening/reacting to that form submission that could be blocking it, or 'preventing default'?

[18:22:15] <Dorf> reset array keys
[18:22:20] <Dorf> not the entire array
[18:22:25] <Dorf> say i have [0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:d] and i delete b and c.  i want the array to then be [0:a, 1:d] but now i'm getting [0:a, 3:d]
[18:22:52] <shoky> what kind of array are you talking about..?
[18:23:34] <Dorf> the exact kind that i just put up
[18:23:52] <rcyr> Dorf: How do you remove elements from the array?
[18:23:55] <shoky> sorry your notation confused me
[18:24:08] <rcyr> (You should be using .slice if you really want to mutate the array)
[18:24:10] <rcyr> Err
[18:24:11] <rcyr> splice
[18:25:00] <Dorf> thanks.  that's what i needed
[19:29:20] <_entropy> i have this text... http://mypastebin.com/test.txt -> and anytime i paste into this page: http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/ -> It doesn't work right (there is supposed to be an alert, but there isn't for this)
[19:29:29] <_entropy> it works for all other things, so i'm confused
[19:29:38] <_entropy> as you can see, it alerts fine with everything else
[20:06:34] <toothe> I am having a jQuery click execute the function "function (e)". How do I get the 'id' or 'value' of that 'e' object?
[20:07:19] <rcyr> $(this).val() or $(this).prop('id'); or this.value or this.id
[20:07:28] * toothe tries that...
[20:08:44] <toothe> there it goes...
[20:08:44] <toothe> thanks!
[20:29:48] <toothe> by capturing, say, the id value, I can get 1 value. How do I have JS pick up two?
[20:30:06] <HoNgOuRu> data-something
[20:30:22] <toothe> pardon?
[20:30:36] <HoNgOuRu> toothe, you can specify values
[20:31:48] <HoNgOuRu> id="txtName" data-attr1="something" data-attr2="something else" and find them with .data("attr1") and .data("attr2")
[20:32:31] <HoNgOuRu> its mandatory to use data- as it before the name of the attribute
[20:33:02] <HoNgOuRu> example: data-team="Uruguay"  and then .... $(this).data("team")
