[00:20:38] <jnewt> is there a way to do a file upload from a drag and drop from gmail?   currently i have a couple of versions of drag and drop working via plain $.post and multipart-form as well as dropzone.js, but i still have to save to my desktop from gmail, then drag into the dropzone or choose file dialog, and then delete the file from my desktop.   would like a more direct route (drag from gmail to a dropzone
[00:21:57] <robertmaxrees> jnewt that cut off but it sounds like you want to drag from gmail straight to another window with a dropzone?
[00:23:12] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, yes, but i don't even know where to start.
[00:23:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that you can.
[00:24:02] <jnewt> if i drag a gmail attachment into another tab / window now, it opens the save as dialog, or if i drag into the tab bar, it opens the file)
[00:25:31] <robertmaxrees> best i can offer is to start here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3694631/html5-drag-and-drop-between-windows
[00:26:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess, however, that the core issue is that you're not dropping a file, you're dropping a link.
[00:26:37] <robertmaxrees> so your file upload will need to look for either a file or a link and respond accordinglky.
[00:36:11] <robertmaxrees> jnewt make sense?
[11:18:45] <KnightsOfni> $anonymouse.attr('checked') - anyone know why this gives false, even when the checkbox is checked?
[14:25:00] <jnewt_> robertmaxrees, yeah, makes sense.   when I drop the file from gmail, it is a link.  however, if i try to use the link in another tab or window, i get 404'd
[14:26:52] <jnewt_> no wait, sometimes it opens the save as dialog.   I don't understand the underlying mechanism.
[21:22:11] <\Kalascus> I have a weird issue with input checkbox, .prop("checked"), & .click()
[21:23:07] <\Kalascus> Testing in the console, .click() will correctly change the prop & then run the function
[21:24:11] <\Kalascus> But when I do .click() from the $(() => {, $(this).prop("checked") always returns false
[21:24:37] <robertmaxrees> \Kalascus mind making a fiddle adn showing what you're doing?
[21:24:59] <robertmaxrees> because it looks like you're using an arrow function but trying to use $(this), which won't work.
[21:25:28] <\Kalascus> $(elem).prop("checked", true).click() & $(elem).click() are effectively the same, which they shouldn't be
[21:25:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a jsfiddle showing the issue because I'm not entirely clear on what you're trying to do :)
[21:26:19] <\Kalascus> Okay hold on
[21:33:13] <\Kalascus> I can't reproduce it
[21:33:24] <robertmaxrees> is it working properly in the fiddle?
[21:33:38] <\Kalascus> Yeah
[21:34:03] <robertmaxrees> what's different between the fiddle and your page?
[21:38:54] <\Kalascus> Hmmâ€¦ I might have figured it out
[21:39:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[21:41:30] <\Kalascus> The issue was with me opening the page in a new tab via chrome's duplicate, which keeps thre state of the inputs, but when the page is loaded I only checked to see if the inputs should be clicked, not if they already are
[21:42:04] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[21:42:08] <\Kalascus> Setting the prop to false before clicking it on page load fixed it
[21:42:14] <robertmaxrees> guessing you mean checked in that case?
[21:42:21] <\Kalascus> Yeah
[21:42:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you triggering click on them if you just want to change their state?
[21:42:52] <\Kalascus> Need to run their on click function
[21:43:31] <robertmaxrees> 2 issues with that: 1: checkboxes shouldn't have a function bound to click, 2: just call the function directly instead of proxying logic through the document.
[21:45:28] <\Kalascus> Directly?
[21:45:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
