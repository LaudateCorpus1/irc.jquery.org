[03:01:51] <Paradisee> o/
[03:19:18] <Paradisee> hello guys
[03:19:42] <Paradisee> is there a way to pass an event to this function?
[03:19:44] <Paradisee> onclick="sgLogout()"
[03:19:50] <Paradisee> it is on a button
[03:24:34] <thykka> yes, use $('.yourElement').on('click', sgLogout)
[03:24:41] <thykka> instead of html onclick attribute
[03:26:20] <Paradisee> why?
[03:27:36] <thykka> it's generally better to attach event handlers that way. the on* html attributes are a very oldschool way of doing this
[03:32:14] <thykka> with onclick, you can only attach one handler to the event, you can't set the handler options, and you can only attach to HTML elements. Also, if you have more than one element using the same handler, you'll have to repeat the onclick on every element individually...
[03:36:02] <Paradisee> thanks
[04:54:01] <Guest79511> Hello. I'm currently using JQuery Mobile v1.5.0-rc1 and having problems with the multiple select inputs. It doesn't show the selected and unselected checkbox icons in the popup menu.
[04:54:30] <Guest79511> This can even be reproduced here in the api docu: https://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/
[04:55:18] <Guest79511> Is this a bug in th is version or do i miss something to get it working like before in v1.4.5?
[04:57:17] <thykka> looks like it could be this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8507
[05:21:58] <Guest79511> Well yes, but seems the suggested changes didn't made it to the version already
[05:22:22] <thykka> right
[05:24:13] <Guest79511> :sad:
[05:28:51] <Guest79511> gonna try to merge the commit into my files here...
[05:29:33] <thykka> good luck!
[05:41:19] <Guest79511> so i found the css parts to be replaced in my css file, but the js parts aren't so clear.
[05:41:24] <Guest79511> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0716afbe4a7c20b2ae1c8361e1727af1619f33d8#diff-2bab321c0a39abf03c5a7f08284acc8b
[05:42:11] <Guest79511> i got a jquery.mobile-1.5.0-rc1.min.js file. would i need to add the js/widgets/forms/select.custom.js to my project?
[05:42:44] <Guest79511> ... as an extra resource
[07:53:02] <paule32> hello
[07:53:14] <paule32> i have the lib jquerui easyui
[07:53:47] <paule32> when i use jquery to add html stuff to a "loaded" page, i have problem
[07:53:49] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/2QFNCMR
[07:53:56] <paule32> the problem is:
[07:54:14] <paule32> the window (code in paste) is not shown, but on top
[07:55:03] <paule32> i can test this easily, because i have a icon, when i dblclick, the window is open, and the icon goes to background
[07:55:58] <paule32> when i use style or css styling, i can add "background-color:gray;", and when i then dblclick the icon, the window area is shown, but not the current content
[07:56:04] <paule32> is that a bug?
[09:30:00] <RoseBus> hello, what type of query is this:  $("form input").keypress(function (e) {
[09:30:11] <RoseBus> it's not searching class or id
[09:30:16] <RoseBus> is it searching element type?
[09:30:20] <Robdgreat> yes
[09:30:31] <RoseBus> all <input> within a <form>?
[09:30:31] <Cork> RoseBus: its css queries
[09:30:32] <Robdgreat> it's an input element inside a form element
[09:30:42] <Cork> it follows the query format of css
[09:31:01] <RoseBus> okay
[09:31:07] <RoseBus> nice
[09:31:15] <RoseBus> is the proper term selector then?
[09:31:29] <Cork> it uses document.querySelectorAll
[09:31:34] <RoseBus> nice ty
[09:31:36] <Cork> plus some javascript extensions
[09:31:45] <Cork> like :eq() and :first() and so on
[09:32:16] <RoseBus> so if i want the function to detect anything on the page it would be $("body") ?
[09:32:48] <Cork> ya, or just $(document)
[09:32:57] <RoseBus> without quotes?
[09:33:06] <Cork> ya, cause document is an object so it isn't a query
[09:33:10] <RoseBus> ok
[09:33:21] <Cork> it just takes document and wraps it in jquery
[09:37:05] <paule32> hello
[09:39:19] <paule32> has someone follow my request?  http://dpaste.com/2E73AMP
[10:00:20] <spackle259> hey guys how do i get the function to return the data when i use the $.get
[10:00:38] <spackle259> I have a function that when I want to call i want it to make the get request and return the value
[10:05:05] <Cork> spackle259: you can't
[10:05:34] <Cork> ajax are async so you have to either use callback or return the value from $.get and use .done(function(data) {}) from that return value
[10:06:15] <spackle259> Cork: Ok thanks. let me try that
[10:07:22] <spackle259> Cork: what would be the best way I can do this?
[10:24:26] <paule32> hello
[10:26:08] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/2E73AMP
[10:28:06] <Cork> spackle259: yourfunc().done(function(data) {})
[10:28:13] <Cork> just do return $.get()...
[11:12:44] <paule32> hello
[12:40:31] <paule32> hello
[12:40:53] <paule32> here, i made a fiddle of my problem with the easyui window :  https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/2/
[12:41:29] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle won't work because the URLs of the external resources aren't https
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, what's the issue paule32?
[12:44:51] <paule32> after page is load, ready, and i click on a pre created (icon)element = div, make dblclick on this element, the easyui-window will not be visible, or the content is like a ghost
[12:45:45] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "the easyui-window will not be visible"?
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about $("#w").window("open"); ?
[12:47:00] <paule32> yes, the element seems be created, but it is not visible, it overlay the icon(s) on my virtual desktop (html - area) so, i must be think, there is be a ghosting magic that goes on
[12:47:04] <robertmaxrees> (it's very difficult to understand the issue since the fiddle doesn't actually work"
[12:47:26] <paule32> i try to https it, please wait a moment
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> fwiw this sounds like an issue with easyui, not jquery itself :)
[12:51:28] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/3/
[12:52:11] <paule32> the thing is, when i pre code, also when the code is static coded per hand, the window is visible
[12:52:23] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/mLzEEkT.png
[12:52:29] <robertmaxrees> still getting 404s.
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> and you mean when you don't create the div via jquery it works fine?
[12:53:26] <paule32> ehm, i can create it per jquery, when i static code - a static html file -
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question./
[12:54:17] <paule32> the answer is yes
[12:54:32] <robertmaxrees> okay.  there are a few reasons that's likely the case.
[12:54:55] <robertmaxrees> first off - i see you're using an ID in that div.  that's a bad idea, since it's getting appended every time you double click.
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> so i'd question this approach entirely, especially if it works fine if you simply have the div on the page in the first place.
[12:55:45] <paule32> moment, i make a fiddle
[12:56:02] <robertmaxrees> the second issue is that you probably need to initialize that div somehow.
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> the easyui docs have a parse method that may be what you need.
[13:05:13] <paule32> here
[13:05:15] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/5/
[13:05:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:05:32] <robertmaxrees> so can you make the bug happen now?
[13:05:44] <paule32> na
[13:05:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:06:14] <paule32> \o/  i must check the css and js
[13:06:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6ks51ozj/
[13:06:22] <robertmaxrees> is this the bug you're talking about?
[13:06:24] <paule32> i copied the demo to fiddle
[13:07:08] <paule32> yes
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so check out what i said early.
[13:07:19] <robertmaxrees> *earlier
[13:10:33] <robertmaxrees> esp. the bit about the parser.
[13:19:31] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/6/
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you're adding more than just that one element.
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> also: that'll fail on every doubleclick after the first one.
[13:24:13] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/7/
[13:24:17] <paule32> but it works
[13:24:23] <paule32> thank you for the tip
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs on the same page.
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> so you need to remove id="w" from your code.
[13:26:04] <robertmaxrees> also, align: left; isn't a thing ;)
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:37:18] <paule32> thanks
[13:37:22] <paule32> miao
[13:37:26] <paule32> miaow
[13:37:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll really want to fix the duplicate ID issue.
[13:37:38] <robertmaxrees> it'll bite you later.
[13:37:53] <paule32> o.O
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:38:46] <paule32> you would me bite
[13:38:59] <robertmaxrees> the duplicate IDs will bite you later.
[13:39:20] <paule32> ah, oh, sorry
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/70129e8m/3/
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> click the "click to add another button" a few times and then click the "click to get current count"
[13:43:02] <paule32> seven texts 1 count
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[13:43:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't duplicate IDs on a page
[13:43:29] <paule32> but per code
[13:43:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:43:56] <paule32> javascript:  var cnt = 1;  ++cnt;
[13:43:59] <paule32> --cnt;
[13:44:03] <robertmaxrees> duide
[13:44:10] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack to work around the bug.
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't duplicate IDs.
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[13:45:34] <paule32> you can: '#foo' + (cnt++).toString()
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> that's also a terrible idea.
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> why are you so resistant to just removing the ID?
[13:46:24] <paule32> not so rough, i will try follow your hints
[13:46:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not a hint tho.
[13:46:44] <robertmaxrees> it's that you have legitimately invalid code.
[13:47:29] <paule32> css: var(--dadell)
[13:47:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:48:04] <paule32> its  css form for using variable
[13:48:08] <paule32> s
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> well aware - what does that have to do with what we're talking about?
[13:49:27] <paule32> may be a work around: $("#foo").css("property","var(--value_var)");
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:49:42] <robertmaxrees> becuse the html is invalid.
[13:49:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't "work around" that - you fix it.
[13:50:01] <paule32> ok
[14:31:21] <Es0teric> i have a question -- is it possible to undo a e.preventDefault() ?
[14:31:34] <taplar> you have to trigger the event again
[14:31:56] <taplar> short answer, no
[14:32:11] <Es0teric> so then .trigger('click')
[14:32:11] <Es0teric> right?
[14:32:24] <taplar> that's one way, yep
[14:32:32] <Es0teric> perfect
[14:34:47] <Es0teric> taplar what if i want to get the query var in a url?
[14:35:04] <taplar> "query var"?
[14:35:32] <taplar> do you mean ?blahThis ?
[14:37:08] <Es0teric> taplar yeah
[14:37:19] <Es0teric> isnt there a method in jquery that lets me get it?
[14:37:28] <taplar> you can grab the href, split on ? and the call pop()
[14:37:58] <Es0teric> window.location.search
[14:38:03] <Es0teric> then split?
[14:38:13] <taplar> oooooh, the actual url, lol
[14:38:37] <taplar> yeah, however you want to grab it.  window.location.search or window.location.href
[14:38:43] <taplar> just split on ? and then pop()
[14:38:56] <taplar> actually though I need to lookup location.search
[14:39:43] <taplar> ah, search is the "?...." part
[14:39:47] <Es0teric> yeah
[14:39:51] <taplar> so if you use search all you need to do is slice(1)
[15:06:29] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone, is there an offline version of the documentation available for api.jqery.com and https://jqueryui.com/ and https://jquerymobile.com/ ??
[15:06:49] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[15:07:34] <taplar> well
[15:07:35] <taplar> lol
[15:07:40] <taplar> you could clone the git repo
[15:07:51] <taplar> repo(s)
[15:07:58] <robertmaxrees> more importantly: why?
[15:16:50] <taplar> rocketmagnet ^
[15:17:39] <robertmaxrees> they did this the other day.
[15:17:42] <robertmaxrees> give 'em a while ;)
[15:17:56] <taplar> but he's a rocket.....AND a magnet
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:31:13] <Flyste> How would I select the specific class value of the div clicked in this scenario: https://pastebin.com/Q9Kynw2r ?
[15:31:32] <robertmaxrees> Flyste what have you tried? :)
[15:31:51] <Flyste> I was looking at closest()
[15:32:08] <taplar> "class value"?
[15:32:11] <Flyste> I'm not sure that can work on a class though?
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ that was my next question
[15:32:16] <robertmaxrees> and what does your js look like?
[15:32:19] <Flyste> the value of the input with that assigned class
[15:32:27] <taplar> ok, you said "div clicked"
[15:32:33] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want the div's class, you want the input's class?
[15:32:59] <Flyste> So when clicking on each div, I want to be able to access the specific values of each input inside that div
[15:33:20] <taplar> so that wouldn't be closest()
[15:33:22] <taplar> that would be find()
[15:33:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:33:27] <taplar> because you are going down, not up
[15:33:54] <Flyste> so $(this)find('classname').val() ?
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> no
[15:34:06] <robertmaxrees> .val() will only get the first input
[15:34:13] <taplar> what exactly are you binding to?
[15:34:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xn9fyg60/ here's the start of a fiddle - add some js :)
[15:34:39] <Flyste> robertmaxrees: each value has it's own class
[15:35:01] <robertmaxrees> flesh out the fiddle - your description on the issue keeps changing.
[15:38:39] <Flyste> https://jsfiddle.net/mfusra3n/
[15:38:42] <Flyste> Something like that
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean $('.clickme').click(function() { ?
[15:39:01] <Flyste> Yeah
[15:39:11] <robertmaxrees> and you just want a specific input's value?
[15:39:16] <taplar> *or all of them?
[15:39:20] <Flyste> Yeah
[15:39:29] <robertmaxrees> to which question? :)
[15:39:30] <Flyste> Speific input, depending on which class I refer to
[15:39:45] <taplar> event.target.value
[15:39:49] <robertmaxrees> then give .find() a specific input
[15:39:54] <robertmaxrees> err, class.
[15:40:27] <robertmaxrees> info01 isn't a valid selector.  .info01 is.  though part of me wonders why you want this in the first place.
[15:40:32] <Flyste> Ok, cool
[15:40:37] <taplar> $('.clickme input').on('click', function(event){ console.log( this.value, event.target.value) });
[15:40:58] <taplar> no need to care which class was clicked.  you know it's an input
[15:41:00] <Flyste> I have a list of videos in which give me URL information I need to assign to a video player depending on which one they click
[15:41:27] <taplar> you have three video players?
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> so do you care about the input that was clicked on, or the div?
[15:41:48] <Flyste> I have one video player, but a list of 20 videos or whatever that they can choose to play
[15:42:08] <robertmaxrees> so what's the deal with three inputs in a div?  how does that relate back?
[15:42:23] <Flyste> I also need the title of the video, the url, etc.
[15:42:38] * taplar is very confused
[15:42:44] <robertmaxrees> sec
[15:43:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u3w2vbh6/2/
[15:43:07] <robertmaxrees> so like this Flyste?
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> and when the user click on a div, you just need the ID or URL or w/e?
[15:43:41] <Flyste> Like this:
[15:43:43] <Flyste> https://jsfiddle.net/mfusra3n/1/
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> sorry, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u3w2vbh6/4/
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:43:56] <robertmaxrees> that's... the same?
[15:44:17] <taplar> i point robert is subtly pointing out is that info# doesn't tell us what they reference
[15:44:23] <Flyste> Yours gave me undefined so I just pasted what I had
[15:44:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i updated with the second one.
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> the HTML is the important bit though - are those classnames closer to what you're trying to do?
[15:44:59] <Flyste> Yeah, the code I pasted I just made as an example
[15:45:00] <robertmaxrees> taplar is right - your original example was confusing af.
[15:45:11] <Flyste> The real code has all the class names with logical names referencing the data
[15:45:14] <robertmaxrees> using actual names and relating it back to the real thing you need helps us help you.
[15:45:21] <taplar> ok, so a single "clickme" references the details about a single video
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> yar
[15:45:39] <Flyste> taplar: yeah
[15:45:45] <taplar> second question, are they really inputs?
[15:45:59] <taplar> or are they like hidden inputs?
[15:46:07] <Flyste> hidden inputs
[15:46:15] <taplar> ok, my suggestion.  use data attributes instead
[15:46:18] <taplar> put that info on the div
[15:46:25] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[15:46:49] <taplar> <div class="clickme" data-url="..." data-name="..." data-whatever="">
[15:46:52] <Flyste> I realize .data() would be easier but I am going on existing code
[15:46:54] <taplar> make your life easy
[15:47:19] <robertmaxrees> Flyste would be a quick change that would make things much cleaner overall, especially for the future, but okie :)
[15:47:25] <robertmaxrees> why change things if you're changing the,?
[15:47:27] <Flyste> Everyone always assumes you're writing everything from scratch :)
[15:47:33] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:47:40] <robertmaxrees> we're assuming that you want to get it right the first time
[15:47:48] <taplar> and make your life as easy as possible
[15:48:47] <Flyste> I understand why you would think that, but in this case, trust that it is easier to not re-write the exsiting code generating the html
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:49:14] <robertmaxrees> nobody said rewriting anything would be easier.
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> just that the final solution itself is a more holistic and overall "easier" solution.
[15:50:08] <Flyste> Maybe you are right
[15:50:29] <taplar> there's also the whole broken window theory too
[15:50:36] <Flyste> I could write a script in vi to use the classname as the data name in the div
[15:50:44] <Flyste> broken window theory?
[15:51:05] <taplar> https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/
[15:51:38] <taplar> the more flaws you passively allow, the more likely you are to let more flaws exist in the future
[15:53:07] <Flyste> That is all true, but one thing one has to take into account is how much is a employer willing to pay you to fix something.  Will they pay 3 times as much to fix something properly or just 1 time to patch something to get it working
[15:53:57] <taplar> how likely is it that the patch will leave things that will later require more patches?
[15:54:26] <Flyste> I inherited a pretty unpleasant code based from another place that I was hired to replace because they sucked
[15:54:55] <Flyste> So there is some stuff that isn't written the best but I have to make calls on if the ends justify the means
[15:55:20] <taplar> Completely understandable.  Which all that is side debate.
[15:55:44] <taplar> Back to your issue, since all the data is related, all you need is to find('input') for the div and you'll get all of them
[15:56:28] <Flyste> Yes, thanks for the help.  I think I actually am going to re-write it and use data in the <div> instead
[15:56:50] <taplar> o.o  now you're messing with me
[15:56:56] <taplar> :P
[15:57:30] <Flyste> I just deleted 400 lines of old jquery so I might as well fix a little bit further down
[16:10:18] <cortexman> Hi all, on Facebook's friend recommender there is a 'remove' button next to each friend, and if you don't click it, it will keep recommending the same friends over and over again. After pasting jquery's source into the console, I am trying to automagically click all these remove buttons without success, yet. ie. $(".removeButton").hover().click() /
[16:10:18] <cortexman> / no dice
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> any errors or anything?
[16:11:31] <cortexman> ^ The output of $(".removeButton") is the same (a list of all the remove buttons) as $(".removeButton").click()
[16:11:50] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do $.fn.jquery in your console?
[16:11:55] <robertmaxrees> what do you get back?
[16:12:05] <cortexman> 3.4.1
[16:12:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.  and nothing happens when you do the .click()?
[16:12:47] <cortexman> nothing at all, except it outputs the same thing as the selector
[16:14:01] <cortexman> If I force the state to hover using the context menu, that works (it hovers when you actually click on it), but that doesn't enable clicking to work from the console
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an issue with jquery's event subsystem beind different from the browser's..
[16:14:35] <robertmaxrees> *being
[16:14:49] <cortexman> I'm guessing that FB knows it's not the mouse somehow, which maybe is the same thing.
[16:14:57] <robertmaxrees> likely not the issue.
[16:15:03] <cortexman> Is there a way to record what happens when I actually click it
[16:15:09] <robertmaxrees> DOM even listeners don't necessarily catch jQuery event listeners.
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> so triggering events via jquery won't necessarily work.
[16:15:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at fiting native handlers.
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just build a plugin that hides that widget :)
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> *fiting = firing
[16:18:28] <cortexman> lol, I seem to have made it work....
[16:18:39] <cortexman> Now there are no friends recommended :-)
[16:18:42] <cortexman> I used the jquery simulate plugin
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[16:19:04] <cortexman> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate/
[16:19:22] <cortexman> It did not have the desired effect :D  We'll see in a couple of days I guess
[16:19:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:20:30] <cortexman> Well, the backend presumably is not built to anticipate that you 'remove' all friend recommendations at once, and so when I refreshed the page, it was empty.
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:20:57] <robertmaxrees> the frontend is likely the issue there.
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> since the backend processed the requests successfully and the UI simply didn't update.
[16:22:54] <cortexman> it works! just takes it a few minutes to re-recommend
[16:22:56] <cortexman> tx for the tip
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> so wait
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> is the issue that you can see the widget?
[17:13:10] <eoli3n_> Hi
[17:13:16] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[17:13:28] <eoli3n_> i want to allow window.close() to kill chrome in kiosk mode
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> Wrong channel :)
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> Check out ##javascript
[17:14:04] <eoli3n_> yep right
[17:14:06] <eoli3n_> thx
[17:54:24] <Flyste> exit
[17:59:15] <taplar> will do in 60 minutes
[18:01:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
