[10:31:54] <bjarne333> the recent xss is very unfortunate
[10:32:26] <bjarne333> as far as I can tell it is exposed when input is stripped/sanitized but not when converted to html entities
[10:43:05] <KcajCrash> I have some dynamic content that generates a form, when I try and pass this form data via ajax post, it is blank. I'm guessing the form is not loaded in time to share the data - but my problem is, when I wrap my submit logic into document ready, it is undefined in time to be able to click the submit
[10:43:05] <KcajCrash> image
[10:43:08] <KcajCrash> Does this make sense?
[10:46:09] <bjarne333> perhaps share some code and I can tell you whats wrong
[10:46:16] <KcajCrash> Okay, hold up m8
[10:46:49] <KcajCrash> What service do you prefer?
[10:47:07] <bjarne333> https://bpaste.net
[10:48:05] <KcajCrash> https://bpa.st/RPSQ
[10:48:16] <KcajCrash> line 127 begins submit logic
[10:48:25] <KcajCrash> line 73 is the image that submits
[10:51:37] <bjarne333> you are passing in this and it refers to the td element which have zero form elements
[10:52:40] <bjarne333> you need a selector for the <form> and jquery will extract all fields which have names
[10:58:00] <KcajCrash> Well
[10:58:07] <KcajCrash> I actually get the proper form id
[10:58:16] <KcajCrash> when I pass that in
[10:58:34] <KcajCrash> alert(formName) returns the correct form name
[10:58:48] <KcajCrash> (Err, form ID, rather)
[10:59:59] <KcajCrash> I am only using obj.id (this) to generate the proper form to send via ajax, since they are created in a dynamic fashion and I can't exactly predict what it will be
[11:00:16] <bjarne333> try console.log(obj);
[11:00:41] <bjarne333> and console.log(formName)
[11:02:19] <KcajCrash> obj contains the image
[11:02:32] <KcajCrash> formName returns the correct form ID
[11:03:00] <KcajCrash> I should mention, this content is loaded dynamic and then attempts to further load more dynamic content
[11:03:28] <KcajCrash> I think the problem is, the form values or something, somehow, are not loaded in time, but as I said, waiting for document ready causes the function not to exist when I try and call it :/
[11:05:17] <bjarne333> avoid duplicate ids
[11:06:52] <KcajCrash> Ahhh
[11:07:09] <KcajCrash> You might be on to something here, let me see, because I gave that image the same id as the form, I can just get obj.somethingelse and set it to that
[11:08:56] <KcajCrash> Nope :/
[11:11:12] <bjarne333> pls give output of console.log($(formName))
[11:11:36] <KcajCrash> #sh1
[11:12:01] <KcajCrash> (which is correct, it has prefix s (for submit), h, for first letter of the liquor, and 1 as that is the ID that Hennessey has in the database XD haha
[11:12:46] <bjarne333> console.log($(formName))
[11:12:48] <KcajCrash> The value of the $pid variable is sh1, and the form then is id #sh1
[11:12:55] <bjarne333> pls
[11:13:16] <bjarne333> it's a call to jquery selector
[11:13:37] <KcajCrash> ahh yeah I did it without selector hold on sorry
[11:14:13] <KcajCrash> k.fn.initÂ [form#sh1]
[11:15:11] <KcajCrash> I have no idea what k.fn.init is ;_;
[11:17:36] <bjarne333> you are doing something very wrong
[11:17:57] <bjarne333> can you try creating a minimal example that actually runs so i can run it?
[11:18:53] <KcajCrash> Hmm, give me a second
[11:20:42] <KcajCrash> I mean, unfortunately, this is the chain that calls this process: index.php loads a page (audit.php), audit.php, when a button is clicked, loads content into a div, which is the code you seen. Inside of that div, I am unable to click a button and post the form data to a tertiary div nested inside
[11:20:42] <KcajCrash> the second - the request goes off, but the post arra
[11:20:42] <KcajCrash> y is empty
[11:21:08] <KcajCrash> Hold on, let me try and have the function grab one of the form values manually, and alert it
[11:21:12] <KcajCrash> before it does the post request
[11:23:23] <KcajCrash> I did a serialize of the data, first and then tried to alert that data, but the data is undefined - I used both formName and a hard-coded reference to the correct form name (as I know it in this instance)
[11:23:46] <KcajCrash> and neither returned any data, which means when this function executes, for whatever reason, it is unable to access the data generated by that form (or that form itself)
[11:23:48] <KcajCrash> correct?
[11:24:59] <bjarne333>  i dont follow. code is too confusing
[11:25:38] <KcajCrash> Well, this might help
[11:26:08] <KcajCrash>   $(document).ready(function() {  <--- when I add this and then a function line, the problem becomes that submitRow is never defined and I'm unable to click
[11:26:16] <KcajCrash> What would that mean?
[11:26:40] <KcajCrash> Because I'm guessing wrapping this code in some kind of delay will allow it to grab the variables, but as I said, when I do that, the function inside is no longer defined (submitRow())
[11:28:45] <bjarne333> it means javascript has function scope. whatever you define in there is not visible outside
[11:29:13] <bjarne333> you should avoid duplicate ids. it is illegal html
[11:29:34] <KcajCrash> I removed them
[11:29:39] <bjarne333> try putting the input elements inside a <td>. they are outside and it is illegal
[11:31:23] <KcajCrash> Still nothing, I'm reading about the scope to see if there is a workaround, this seems to be something that happens when you are many ajax calls deep or something?
[11:31:33] <KcajCrash> tbh, I use almost identical code elsewhere and it works
[11:33:04] <bjarne333> what does console.log($('form#sh1').length); give?
[11:33:28] <bjarne333> also you can try inspect the dom using browser inspect to see if the form is actually there.
[11:38:53] <KcajCrash> Oh crap :(
[11:39:06] <KcajCrash> I'm not sure what the hell I did because I tried about 20 of the suggestions at once and also my own tinkering
[11:39:11] <KcajCrash> but it somehow magicially started to work
[11:39:21] <KcajCrash> Which is a disaster since I'm not sure which step broke it haha
[11:40:29] <KcajCrash> bjarne333: You have been extremely helpful and thanks for telling me some things I was unaware of, I just now learned about the jquery scope a lot better and am now aware I can't put form elements outside of td, although I already knew I couldn't do duplicate ids, I was also unaware I'd done that
[11:40:29] <KcajCrash> here
[11:40:31] <KcajCrash> :)
[11:41:00] <bjarne333> alright cool.
[16:19:22] <bjarne333> so about that recent xss..
[16:19:42] <bjarne333> it's unfortunate. imagine all those webapps that need to be updated.
[16:20:21] <bjarne333> it's also surprising that no one has taken a look at the regex pattern for vulns like that before
[16:21:11] <bjarne333> I guess not all bugs are shallow with lots of eyeballs
[20:24:57] <snackoverflow> why does this alert fire without any clicking? https://jsfiddle.net/8pbsy79m/
[20:28:22] <Feldmaus> "onclick: do_something()" runs the function and stores the result in onclick. You just want to store the function itself with "onclick: do_something"
[20:33:33] <Feldmaus> And it's annyoing that you ask the same question in different channels at the same time :S
[22:23:08] <snackoverflow> Feldmaus: :x
