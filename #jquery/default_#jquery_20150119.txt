[00:03:25] <Guest91009> I think I am causing a loop here: http://codepad.org/IB1on9Wa what I am trying to do is on submit, validate the forms before the actual submit.
[00:03:30] <Guest91009> Is there another way of doing this?
[00:04:14] <Woet> only do event.preventDefault(); when your validation fails?
[00:05:10] <Guest91009> that is so smart...
[00:05:58] <Woet> well thank you.
[00:06:31] <Guest91009> I will try it, I'll be back... need to restart my browser due to the previous hanging.
[00:15:29] <jnz> if you load your js at bottom of the page, do you need onload?
[00:15:32] <jnz> function
[00:15:45] <prohobo> yes
[00:16:02] <prohobo> jnz there might be other scripts setting up
[00:16:13] <prohobo> always safer to just wait until everything else is done
[00:16:53] <prohobo> i think it's sometimes better to use $(window).load()
[00:18:26] <jnz> more than document ready
[00:18:36] <jnz> ?
[00:18:37] <Cork> uh, no you don't need onload or ready
[00:18:53] <Cork> if you load at the end of the body you effectively do the same thing as ready
[00:19:43] <Cork> and you normally want ready
[00:20:06] <Cork> load is only interesting if you need to wait for all images to be rendered to get the correct dimensions of them
[00:20:24] <Cork> normally you want ready so you can do modifications before the page renders for the first time
[00:27:56] <Omar-> good morning
[00:30:24] <Erwat> good morning indeed
[00:30:43] <Omar-> :)
[00:30:47] <Omar-> quiet morning
[00:33:02] <Erwat> okay i lied
[00:33:26] <Erwat> when i said indeed i gave off the impression like this was a splendid morning for me, it wasn't; i was just reciprocating the fact that it is morning and offered a greeting
[00:34:45] <prohobo> good mornian
[00:43:41] <Omar-> prohobo morning!
[00:44:03] <esko> Morning ;) Cork helped me the other day to loop over my stuff, i would love some help and understanding on how to format it (in a good way). Each test.results[i] i would like to have in a own div (in real life i will add each result inside an expandable accordion w bootstrap).  http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/qzh41pha/9/
[00:44:47] <esko> surely the way to go is not to do like if (key === failure ) {} ? =)
[00:45:25] <Cork> esko: what do you mean format?
[00:46:40] <esko> Cork: give the test result a class at least so i can style it, and then have a list inside it, or just the key:values that are in it, im not sure how to approach it.
[00:46:53] <esko> there's a link to a image on the fiddle
[00:47:49] <Cork> so add a class to the li based on the key
[00:48:34] <Cork> something like '<li class="type-', key, '">'
[00:49:12] <prohobo> '<li class="' + obj['class'] + '">' ?
[00:49:17] <Cork> no
[00:49:55] <prohobo> I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD COMMA CONCAT STRINGS
[00:49:58] <prohobo> wow
[00:50:04] <Cork> prohobo: its an array
[00:50:29] <prohobo> hm
[00:50:47] <Cork> esko: http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/11/

[00:54:12] <stompdaroach> Cork: what do you use for server side coding?
[00:54:17] <stompdaroach> usually
[00:54:28] <Cork> stompdaroach: go and rails
[00:54:35] <Cork> some python and php
[00:54:52] <Cork> but mostly go and rails
[00:55:19] <stompdaroach> whats go
[00:55:37] <Cork> ?g golang
[00:55:43] <b-ot> Cork: The Go Programming Language → https://golang.org/
[00:56:02] <stompdaroach> never heard
[00:56:13] <Cork> its a language out of google
[00:56:21] <Cork> it has a built in webserver
[00:56:26] <stompdaroach> oh
[00:56:29] <stompdaroach> i need to check that out
[00:56:31] <Cork> and is very nice for writing small servers
[00:56:44] <Cork> and extreamly fast
[00:56:48] <esko> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/qzh41pha/12/
[00:57:04] <esko> :/
[00:57:09] <Cork> esko: ok?
[00:57:24] <Cork> ah
[00:57:29] <esko> The class should only apply to "failure"
[00:57:40] <esko> and then the things inside it needs a class too
[00:57:51] <Cork> if you want to wrap the text you need an element for the text
[00:57:57] <Cork> a class won't do
[00:57:58] <esko> like failure-data
[00:58:16] <Cork> esko: but the array at line 8 is just html
[00:58:25] <Cork> you should be able to handle adding what you want there
[00:59:43] <esko> yeah but should i do like "if (key==failure) {<li ... ? or what would be a good way to approach the different tests.
[01:00:01] <Cork> esko: just always add the span around the key: value
[01:00:04] <esko> sorry for all the lame questions, i have not tuoched the web since 2000 :)
[01:00:06] <Cork> and then add the class
[01:00:14] <Cork> no need for logic
[01:01:04] <esko> would you mind throwing an example?
[01:01:33] <shai33333> a question in angular- the event listener doest work here any idea?        $rootScope.ref = window.open(authUrl, '_system', 'location=yes,toolbar=no'); $rootScope.ref.addEventListener('loadstart', function(event) { alert('start: ' + event.url); });
[01:01:38] <Cork> esko: you should be able to do this
[01:01:39] <Cork> it isn't hard
[01:01:53] <Cork> esko: http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/13/
[01:03:55] <Cork> shai33333: uh, are you sure you want loadstart?
[01:04:48] <shai33333> i am trying to do as here http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/google-api-oauth-with-phonegaps-inappbrowser.html
[01:05:06] <esko> ah, yeah :D

[02:40:00] <cody__> Hi. Is there a way to set a whole pages links to target _self via jquery?
[02:40:50] <Cork> cody__: $('a').each(function() { $(this).attr('target', 'self'); })
[02:41:45] <Cork> cody__: though note, that line is quite costly
[02:43:13] <cody__> why do you mean with that its quite costly?
[02:43:31] <Cork> cody__: it loops and modifies every a element in the page
[02:43:39] <Cork> you don't want to do that too often
[02:43:46] <Cork> as like i said it is costly
[02:47:15] <Erwat> Cork: but costly means it is expensive!
[02:47:24] <Erwat> i thought you meant it'll cost me $1 every time i run it!
[02:49:30] <mooncup> cost doesn't have to be money Erwat
[02:49:54] <mooncup> though I guess technically if a cpu is working harder it may use more power which would in turn cost the user more money
[02:51:02] <cody__> Cork:  I have an embeded iframe google spreadsheet in my page Google spreadsheet lets you only link pages in new tab. this is where I stuck... Thats why I was wondering another way to control google target style..
[02:53:12] <Cork> cody__: you can't modify the dom if you embed an iframe from a third party domain
[02:53:18] <Cork> so that most likely isn't an option
[02:53:33] <jamesbind> guys i need your genuine help, i cant seem to load a main script unless i do a setTimeout function with 300ms wait time. how can i dynamically load the script based on user load time
[02:53:57] <jamesbind> document ready doesnt work. im glad i even got settimeout to load the script but i need to make it dynamic per user
[02:53:58] <Cork> jamesbind: uh, user load time?
[02:54:07] <Cork> ?paste @ jamesbind
[02:54:07] <b-ot> jamesbind: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:54:23] <cody__> Cork:  thanks for paying attention anyway...
[02:54:59] <Erwat> jamesbind: may i ask why document ready doesn't work?
[02:55:13] <jamesbind> guys http://jsfiddle.net/9c4bfh5h/
[02:55:41] <Cork> jamesbind: are you loading "color-themes" with ajax?
[02:55:46] <jamesbind> no
[02:55:58] <Cork> ok, then you share too little context
[02:56:10] <Cork> that should work just fine without setTimeout
[02:56:53] <YamakasY> mhh nice now I need to enable Cors
[02:57:10] <jamesbind> im using angularjs in my app as well
[02:57:18] <jamesbind> and created a directive and still the same problem
[02:57:46] <jamesbind> i need to wait for DOM to load before executing that i thought thats what doc ready would do for me but it doesnt
[02:58:12] <Cork> jamesbind: your doing something that is outside dom load
[02:58:17] <Cork> cause that IS what dom ready is
[02:58:38] <cody__> Cork: btw here that guy made it some how its css I guess but you think you can understand his way? http://webapp.cellmaster.com.au/webapp.html?appid=fdae197b0ecc4aae86a5bf7d9cd5bb4a
[03:00:15] <Cork> ugg its all tucked away inside a minified js file
[03:00:26] <Cork> cody__: have fun, i will NOT dig into that
[03:02:25] <cody__> Cork:  no okay :)
[03:06:54] <YamakasY> guy do you enable Cors ?
[03:07:10] <Cork> YamakasY: the responding server sets the cors headers
[03:07:17] <Cork> ?g mdn cors
[03:07:19] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[03:07:27] <YamakasY> Cork, yes I know, but is it common to do ?
[03:07:53] <Cork> YamakasY: how do you commonly answer a http request: it depends on what answers the question
[03:08:16] <YamakasY> Cork, huh ?
[03:08:52] <Cork> YamakasY: how you do it depends on what you use as a webserver / what server language you use
[03:09:13] <YamakasY> Cork, Apache, PHP, javascript/jquery
[03:09:16] <Cork> it can't be answered generically for a "usually do it"
[03:09:24] <YamakasY> no I mean in security
[03:09:30] <Cork> huh?
[03:09:42] <Cork> ?g php header
[03:09:44] <b-ot> Cork: PHP: header - Manual → http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[03:10:15] <Cork> YamakasY: note this HAS to be done by the server end
[03:10:21] <Cork> js has no control over this
[03:10:25] <YamakasY> Cork, I know!
[03:10:32] <CptFrech> Hey, jQuery("div","<div>aasa</div>") is returning Object[] - is it intended ?
[03:10:50] <Cork> YamakasY: that isn't too clear, your questions makes little sense
[03:11:00] <CptFrech> atrugling with this context selector for a whil enow :D
[03:11:10] <Cork> CptFrech: that line isn't valid
[03:11:13] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[03:11:37] <YamakasY> Cork, nah I mean, with a DNS poisoning someone can messup
[03:11:48] <Cork> CptFrech: actually, sorry it is
[03:12:01] <CptFrech> In reality I want to parse a HTML node from a JSON file - I want to get a span element of a property
[03:12:02] <Cork> CptFrech: your trying to select a div child of <div>aaaa</div>
[03:12:07] <CptFrech> yes
[03:12:10] <Cork> and it matches nothing as there is no children
[03:12:35] <CptFrech> so to do this I need to select a node from a custom HTML context
[03:12:45] <Cork> ?paste @ CptFrech
[03:12:45] <b-ot> CptFrech: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:13:05] <CptFrech> kk mom
[03:13:12] <Cork> YamakasY: cors is not a dns security feature
[03:13:24] <Cork> YamakasY: that is what https/dnssec is for
[03:13:50] <YamakasY> Cork, no I see it as a security issue
[03:14:25] <Cork> YamakasY: what?
[03:14:56] <Cork> YamakasY: enabling cors or not enabling cors brings absolutely zero security for dns pinioning
[03:15:11] <Cork> YamakasY: cors is not a dns security feature
[03:15:19] <YamakasY> poisoning!
[03:15:36] <YamakasY> do you know what DNS poisoning is ?
[03:15:41] <Cork> ...
[03:15:44] <Cork> sigh
[03:15:52] <YamakasY> apperently not
[03:16:04] <Cork> apparently your a troll...
[03:16:08] <YamakasY> it means fake dns
[03:16:18] <Cork> yay plenty of spammers here to day...
[03:16:26] <YamakasY> ?
[03:16:38] <YamakasY> you must have a blue monday
[03:17:17] <Cork> YamakasY: i will say one last things before i put you in the ignore queue; learn the terms before throwing them around like candy
[03:17:37] <Cork> and don't thing ppl don't know something just cause you don't
[03:17:56] <YamakasY> Cork, huh ? so when you have the idea you are attacked because someone ask a decent question you use your op rights to ignore someone ?
[03:17:57] <YamakasY> LOL
[03:18:03] <CptFrech> okay pasted it - http://jsfiddle.net/1mwq0nwe/ - jsonResponseValue represents the string from the AJAX request :)
[03:22:50] <CptFrech> hmm ahh okay jQuery("div","<div><div>aasa</div></div>") is working
[03:23:13] <CptFrech> I think I have an mistake in the understanding of the context function
[03:23:55] <CptFrech> it automatically uses .find on it - well thanks for pointing me into the right direction !
[03:24:09] <CptFrech> Cork - do you have twitter? can send you a dogecoin tip
[03:26:49] <Erwat> CptFrech: Cork is actually an advanced AI
[03:27:12] <Erwat> powered by the joy of fixing programming frustration
[03:30:24] <CptFrech> srsly ?
[03:33:15] <Erwat> no, of course not
[03:33:21] <Erwat> but he's incredibly helpful like every single day
[03:34:14] <CptFrech> maybe you both are AI's - cannot trust anybody anymore :D
[03:35:05] <Erwat> i'm too messed up to be an AI, sorry
[03:36:23] <CptFrech> lol
[03:54:34] <YamakasY> Erwat, fix yourself!

[04:05:07] <Meir`> delboy1978uk, from first look, i think it's responsive-slider.js
[04:05:47] <delboy1978uk> thanks Meir`. i seem to have broken it ion my own site, i'll see what i have done :-P
[04:07:53] <Meir`> delboy1978uk. i was wrong
[04:07:58] <Meir`> it's a simple jquery
[04:08:07] <Meir`> look here: http://bootstraptaste.com/theme/greeen/js/main.js
[04:08:26] <Meir`> the very first lines
[04:09:08] <Meir`> binds to $(window).scroll, and checkes the scrollTop() value
[04:09:13] <Meir`> checks*
[04:23:34] <delboy1978uk> thanks again. it looks like modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js is what is dealing with it
[04:24:05] <delboy1978uk> however when i load that js in, the prev/next buttons on my caroyusel stop working lmao
[04:40:23] <jimcky> hello #jquery, I am trying to use $.ajax to post data (in form of FormData object), and realized that I will have to set processData: false to make it work, may I ask in what condition I will have to set this as false other than sending FormData object?
[04:54:15] <shoky> jimcky: see here the different types of things you can send in an xhr (Blob, Document, FormData, etc)  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send()
[04:54:40] <shoky> i suppose processData:false would be needed for most of those

[05:53:27] <bonhoeffer> i’m having trouble getting a function to call — it seems pretty straightforward. i’ve created a gist to show the problem: https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/5f259057110436891777
[05:53:51] <bonhoeffer> i’m a back end guy — pretty sure i’m missing something simple . . . map_hit_test is out of scope
[05:53:57] <hackal> Hello I have several <ul>'s in my html with same class. I need to remove all of their <li>'s but the first one. http://jsfiddle.net/96eht5g8/ here you can see the code. It works but only on the first one. Could you please help me fix this so it works on all <ul>? thanks
[05:56:59] <Uhkis> hackal: http://jsfiddle.net/96eht5g8/1/
[05:57:33] <mbrzuzy> bonhoeffer, which line is throwing the error?
[05:57:41] <hackal> Uhkis: I see, thank you very much for help
[05:57:50] <bonhoeffer> the call map_hit_test(getTileCoordinate(e.latLng, map), "cd-2012", null, function(key, data) {
[05:57:59] <bonhoeffer> you can see the error at the bottom
[05:58:23] <bonhoeffer> it is a classic: map_hit_test does not exist
[05:58:37] <bonhoeffer> sorry — should have put line number there
[05:58:44] <mbrzuzy> From first glance, it's because the function is locally scopped to that file because it's in (function() { })
[05:59:17] <delboy1978uk> hackal http://jsfiddle.net/96eht5g8/2/
[05:59:18] <mbrzuzy> As a test, try assigning the function to window.map_hit_test
[05:59:25] <mbrzuzy> then call, window.map_hit_test()
[05:59:34] <bonhoeffer> yes, that is it — good catch — and bad on me
[05:59:39] <bonhoeffer> thanks
[05:59:41] <mbrzuzy> No problem
[05:59:55] <delboy1978uk> oh Uhkis paste is better :-)
[06:00:06] <Uhkis> delboy1978uk: lol way to make it overly complicated :D
[06:00:15] <mbrzuzy> bonhoeffer, Module pattern might be useful for you (if you don't know about it already) :)
[06:00:25] <hackal> delboy1978uk: thanks too, its good to see more ways of solving one problem.

[06:15:32] <ajaxer> hello. i am trying to post to my server and get a json response back. when the data returns the following error: " JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data"
[06:15:43] <ajaxer> but the json itself is valid
[06:15:54] <ajaxer> firebug also reads it as valid
[06:16:23] <ajaxer> this is the json "       {"answer":false,"message":"The operation failed. Please contact support.","data":null}               "
[06:16:47] <ajaxer> tried chrome too, still no luck
[06:17:01] <ajaxer> any idea what is causing it?
[06:23:08] <ajaxer> nevermind, got it
[06:31:58] <cjohnson> The issue was that the JSON wasn't valid as you thought :P
[06:55:36] <delboy1978uk> hi guys my carousel prev/next buttons dont work, and i beleive modernizr is to blame for it, can anyone help? http://einstein-iapp.eu/
[06:59:47] <decx> it's your map integration
[07:08:15] <pjammer> morning. Any full calendar users around?
[07:11:21] <pjammer> may have found.
[07:11:57] <delboy1978uk> decx: my map integration?
[07:12:51] <delboy1978uk> pjammer: what this? http://fullcalendar.io/
[07:12:54] <delboy1978uk> looks cool
[07:13:42] <pjammer> delboy1978uk yeah, it's a good viewer, just when you want to do more 'things' the magic gets in the way. but with anything new it takes a bit of spelunking to get used to
[07:14:20] <decx> delboy1978uk if i block google maps your buttons work fine
[07:18:19] <delboy1978uk> really? i dont even need that gmaps stuff for this site, so i'll just ditch it!
[07:18:51] <delboy1978uk> decx when you say block, what do you mean?
[07:19:41] <decx> not allowing javascript from that domain
[07:20:16] <delboy1978uk> ah ok, how do i do that? i'm in ff and i have firebug
[08:13:01] <hellier> If I do var foo = new CROP();
[08:13:12] <hellier> Is there anyway to get the name 'foo' inside the crop() function?
[08:13:25] <hellier> I'm after the actual name of the instance
[08:40:07] <zeroquake> where do i start if i am trying to implement search ,autocomplete on a nested structure like folders in windows
[08:43:02] <gtristan> that's a big question
[08:43:40] <zeroquake> i have nested tree strcuture of json , basically its folders with files in them
[08:43:46] <gtristan> zeroquake, I've done similar but not with a real toolkit (not with crappy DOM / web API)
[08:44:00] <zeroquake> i want to be able to search through names of folders and files
[08:44:09] <gtristan> some pointers I can say is... it's a lot about how you're going to display results
[08:44:21] <gtristan> a treeish result is visible if any child is a match
[08:44:35] <gtristan> it's nice to have highlighting of the portion of the text which matched
[08:44:41] <zeroquake> but what approach do i take in quering for matching terms
[08:44:50] <zeroquake> DOM searching is expensive no ?
[08:45:06] <gtristan> and it's nice if your autocomplete completes with a prefix match... but the search results are search in string (like strstr() vs strcmp())
[08:46:04] <gtristan> for web, I don't know, in my own, very custom approach, I hold all stats in JS objects and the DOM is output only
[08:46:14] <gtristan> for many jquery style programmers, that is heresy
[08:46:41] <zeroquake> one of ways i could think of was build a array contaning all strings
[08:46:45] <gtristan> if you have a typical functional programming approach, your pretty screwed and have all state in the DOM on data- attributes
[08:47:09] <zeroquake> and one more objects with previous array index as keys and respective data as values
[08:47:22] <gtristan> right, it could be done with an array of objects with a string / parent
[08:47:26] <gtristan> or with nested arrays
[08:47:37] <zeroquake> find matching strings in array -- use their index - get data -- and show results
[08:48:15] <zeroquake> what do u think of this approach if i have like 2000 to 3000 folders , files being displayed
[08:48:15] <gtristan> I guess an array of objects is easier
[08:48:30] <gtristan> i.e. the parent is a reference to another object in the same array
[08:48:34] <zeroquake> the problem is iterating through huge list of objectds
[08:48:52] <zeroquake> iterating through is like super fast atleast in jsperf
[08:48:56] <zeroquake> array*
[08:48:59] <gtristan> then you do the search simply on the array, and use the parent references to determine visibility of parent branches
[08:49:31] <caseyd> I'm having a little trouble getting started and looking for some kind of demo or tutorial. I have a CSV file and I would like to search for a string and have it return the string in the adjecent field. Can someone help
[08:49:57] <gtristan> would iterating over an array of { string / reference } objects be costly ? I'm not sure it would
[08:50:15] <robertmaxrees> gtristan it's like any other array - and don't worry too much about performance.
[08:50:39] <gtristan> that's what I would expect
[08:51:21] <robertmaxrees> don't prematurely optimize.  jsperf is nice sometimes, but keep in mind that most engines will do some magical stuff for you to make things run faster.
[08:51:33] <gtristan> but if you're going to have members which refer to other objects... you might want to be paranoid and nullify everything when freeing it, but then... references would not be circular with treeish data so the GC should be alright
[08:52:06] <gtristan> premature optimization is the root of all evil, yes
[08:52:22] <gtristan> except when it comes to table rows in the DOM... they are just horrible ;-)
[08:52:56] <zeroquake> it is just that i have around 1000 and above sets of folders , thought it would make a difference
[08:53:15] <zeroquake> will try this method , thanks guys
[08:53:29] <robertmaxrees> caseyd find a csv parsing library.
[08:53:38] <gtristan> zeroquake, it should not make a difference really for 1000 entries in JS, it should be snappy
[08:53:53] <gtristan> zeroquake, showing 1000 table rows on the other hand, will be a real pain in the arse
[08:54:19] <gtristan> because the damn native scrollbars wont let you set the position and size of the scrollbar manually
[08:54:36] <gtristan> so you cant scroll through millions of rows while using only 20 rows of actual cells
[08:54:50] <gtristan> like you would with a regular toolkit (like iOS does for example)
[09:14:48] <pentagrass> I need to check if an option is selected. I use $("foo option:selected"); and that ends up grabbing the selected option from the NEXT select. Is there any way to do what I'm trying to do?
[09:15:00] <pentagrass> There are 2 selects
[09:17:12] <ThoMe> hih
[09:17:14] <ThoMe> i try $("fieldset:last").html("bluba");
[09:17:16] <ThoMe> but doesnt works.
[09:17:19] <ThoMe> no error no result
[09:17:23] <ThoMe> any ideas why?
[09:17:36] <ThoMe> have fieldset id="test"></fieldset)
[09:17:49] <mbrzuzy> try :last-child
[09:18:11] <mbrzuzy> pentagrass, there are different ways to target the first element
[09:18:16] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: Your question is confusing.
[09:18:59] <BillCriswell> Also, if it's a select there's always something selected.
[09:19:02] <ThoMe> mbrzuzy: hm. fieldset:last-child doesnt works. hm.
[09:19:28] <mbrzuzy> How about $('fieldset').last()
[09:19:28] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: They both work.
[09:20:26] <ThoMe>  $('fieldset').last() has results.
[09:20:32] <ThoMe> one result.
[09:21:00] <BillCriswell> It sounds like you're trying before the document is ready.
[09:21:10] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/wiyono/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:22:32] <pentagrass> What if I wanted to make the first option in a select selected?
[09:22:39] <pentagrass> .select()?
[09:23:04] <duch_kazatel> .prop('selected', true);
[09:23:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/646yy2dk/
[09:24:26] <pentagrass> duch_kazatel: that's great but I need to just select the first option. Would that be something like .child()?
[09:24:39] <pentagrass> erm
[09:25:41] <Omar-> penguin_dan $("select option:eq(0)").prop("selected", true);
[09:25:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/646yy2dk/1/
[09:25:53] <Omar-> :eq(0) == first option
[09:25:56] <robertmaxrees> this works, too.
[09:26:21] <Omar-> +1
[09:52:57] <stangeland> why is the slidevar not showing up? http://jsfiddle.net/nwnjvxwh/2/  i followed the doc precisely: https://github.com/darsain/sly/blob/master/docs/Markup.md
[09:58:48] <robertBusy> stangeland https://github.com/darsain/sly/blob/master/docs/Calling.md
[09:58:51] <robertBusy> need to follow this, too.
[09:59:07] <stangeland> robertBusy, ahh yes
[09:59:52] <stangeland> robertBusy, ahh damn i dont think i can do it on the fiddle, i get: Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darsain/sly/master/dist/sly.min.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.

[10:00:20] <robertBusy> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nwnjvxwh/5/
[10:00:25] <robertBusy> need to use rawgit as a CDN
[10:00:54] <robertBusy> https://rawgit.com/
[10:00:58] <stangeland> robertBusy, ahhhh i see
[10:00:59] <robertBusy> for future reference
[10:01:51] <stangeland> robertBusy, hmm still with the init its not really doing anything :/
[10:02:07] <robertBusy> that init is invalid ;)
[10:02:17] <robertBusy> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nwnjvxwh/7/
[10:03:20] <stangeland> robertBusy, yeah... its not really rolling at all :/
[10:03:35] <robertBusy> sure - need to make some tweaks.
[10:03:37] <robertBusy> you should get the idea.
[10:04:02] <stangeland> robertBusy, hmm maybe i need to set the width somehow
[10:04:06] <robertBusy> and you can click and drag iot.
[10:05:08] <stangeland> click and drag? now? I can't can you do that?
[10:05:18] <robertBusy> yep.
[10:05:56] <stangeland> robertBusy, w000t on this? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nwnjvxwh/7/
[10:06:20] <robertBusy> yep.
[10:06:25] <robertBusy> and this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nwnjvxwh/8/
[10:07:19] <stangeland> robertBusy, thats so weird....i just see 4 images on that last nr8 fiddle....but nothing happens at all if i click or drag or anything
[10:07:31] <stangeland> ahhh yes
[10:07:37] <stangeland> now it works hehe
[10:10:00] <stangeland> robertBusy, do you know if its possible to put arrows on it and have it roll around when last image is reached?
[10:11:07] <robertBusy> no clue.
[10:11:11] <robertBusy> i'd have to read the docs.
[10:11:15] <robertBusy> and google around.
[10:12:20] <stangeland> robertBusy, which lib do you usually use for these kinda things?
[10:12:28] <robertBusy> none - i avoid carousels like the plague.
[10:12:44] <robertBusy> bxslider is the last one i used iirc
[10:13:12] <stangeland> robertBusy, oh - why avoid?
[10:13:54] <robertBusy> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[10:15:53] <stangeland> robertBusy, hmmm i agree for many cases its a bad idea
[10:15:58] <stangeland> but not in my case :)
[10:16:06] <robertBusy> `shrug
[10:16:07] <b-ot> robertBusy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:16:52] <robertBusy> everybody wants to be a special snowflake :)
[10:18:17] <cjohnson> heh. every developer since dinosaurs thought their situation was the exception
[10:26:11] <stangeland> cjohnson, yeah, i know and i agree, but mine really is the exception
[10:26:19] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[10:26:19] <cjohnson> lol
[10:26:40] <stangeland> cjohnson, srsly
[10:27:12] <HikaruBG> I am trying to write an input masking plugin, but the Firefox browser of Mozilla don't position the cursor at the end of the input value.
[10:27:39] <HikaruBG> how can I move the cursor at the end of the input value after I perform the masking action ?
[10:27:56] <cjohnson> stangeland: what is it?
[10:28:13] <stangeland> cjohnson, aha so you got excited now :D
[10:28:31] <stangeland> cjohnson, its basically storyboard images
[10:28:41] <robertBusy> HikaruBG the simplest is to do this.value = this.value
[10:28:53] <robertBusy> set the value back to itself, basically.
[10:29:13] <stangeland> cjohnson, so each images has a story to tell, and a small comment, and they are viewed in a specific order...kinda like looking through a booklet
[10:29:24] <HikaruBG> thanks Robert, let me try
[10:30:13] <stangeland> cjohnson, so would you agree that a caraousel is pretty well suited for specifically this scenario?
[10:32:45] <masscrx_> hi
[10:33:19] <masscrx_> I'm trying to make .then(), my syntax is : this._makeQuery().then(function(){ })
[10:33:42] <masscrx_> and  _makeQuery: function(){ var dfd = new $.Deferred();dfd.resolve();return dfd.promise; }
[10:33:57] <masscrx_> bu in console I have error: TypeError: this._makeQuery(...).then is not a function
[10:34:12] <stangeland> cjohnson, ?
[10:34:29] <robertBusy> masscrx_ make a fiddle :)
[10:36:46] <robertBusy> masscrx_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/17gopmcj/ this is your problem :)
[10:37:04] <cjohnson> stangeland: ?
[10:37:18] <stangeland> cjohnson, did you see my msg?
[10:37:39] <cjohnson> I was just trying to get you to expand on your question. I don't necessarily think your use case is exception-worthy
[10:37:41] <masscrx_> robertBusy: uno momento
[10:38:01] <stangeland> cjohnson, why not
[10:38:16] <krambiorix> hi, i can't make ckeditor to work in this jsfiddle. The actual problem is setting the height... Can someone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/qoLh28g4/
[10:38:34] <cjohnson> stangeland: that's not how an exception is argued: you argue the "why" not the "why not"
[10:38:57] <cjohnson> I just don't see it as all that compelling. There are other options
[10:39:16] <stangeland> cjohnson, such as?
[10:39:48] <cjohnson> "Because I like this approach" is not cause enough for an exception imo. Such as just displaying the data normally, left to right, top down. Allowing people to read at whatever pace they want without necessarily having to keep their hand on their mouse if they so choose
[10:40:09] <cjohnson> You can divide it up and make it visually look like pages without ruining people's ability to just read through
[10:41:30] <stangeland> cjohnson, i do not at all have enough space to show all images at once...that would take up insane amounts of space and be very confusing
[10:41:53] <cjohnson> Have you heard of the scroll bar?
[10:42:01] <robertBusy> krambiorix check out your console.
[10:42:11] <robertBusy> ckeditor isn't defined.
[10:42:51] <stangeland> cjohnson, yes but scrollbare does not spin around unfortunately, because it should be easy to get from end to start
[10:43:44] <masscrx_> robertBusy: http://jsfiddle.net/rycn7jhy/1/ something like that
[10:43:50] <stangeland> cjohnson, otherwise it would actually be nice to do just a scrollbar
[10:43:55] <cjohnson> you can easily make that happen, or a button at the end...there are lots of options. And that's my point -- you haven't really demonstrated why this is the *only* way. So if you're asking me, I don't think it's an exception. That said, you're gonna do what you're gonna do and discussing this further is probably pointless
[10:44:20] <robertBusy> masscrx_ did you see my last fiddle?
[10:44:26] <masscrx_> yes
[10:44:49] <masscrx_> but I'm working with jquery-ui widget factory so maybe I've made some bad syntax
[10:44:58] <stangeland> cjohnson, usually put content in carousels that should not be there
[10:45:07] <stangeland> cjohnson, *usually people pu
[10:45:08] <stangeland> t
[10:45:22] <robertBusy> masscrx_ return dfd, not dfd.promise.
[10:45:42] <stangeland> cjohnson, you see even steve jobs loved the image carousels
[10:45:53] <stangeland> cjohnson, and he was the biggest design genious ever
[10:45:58] <cjohnson> lol. As I said I don't believe this is an exception. I don't see why it *should* be there. But let's stop spamming teh channel about it, do what you're gonna do
[10:46:03] <masscrx_> ahh shit, ok thx ;]
[10:46:18] <stangeland> cjohnson, yeah...but i cant make it work :/
[10:46:32] <stangeland> cjohnson, it wont spin around :/
[10:46:54] <stangeland> this is what i have: http://jsfiddle.net/nwnjvxwh/9/
[10:47:06] <HikaruBG> robertBusy, this didn't work
[10:47:20] <cjohnson> You can detect the last item's scroll position and scroll back to the top. Or do some fancy trickery to re-shuffle things to the top of the list. or just a button at the end "back to beginning"
[10:47:27] <HikaruBG> instead using the jquery caret works, but it repeats some of the values
[10:48:17] <stangeland> cjohnson, hmmm yes - if i could somehow hover arrows left, right on each side like they have in the boostrap carousel
[10:50:07] <HikaruBG> robertBusy, this is an error I get only with Firefox for Android
[10:50:07] <stangeland> cjohnson,ohhhhhhhh look what i found :D http://www.bootply.com/94452
[10:56:49] <stangeland> robertBusy, do you know how to make the margin between each image smaller? http://www.bootply.com/QaaGA8emr1  and also make the total slider width more narrow?
[11:04:45] <robertBusy> with css?
[11:14:41] <pthreat> Hey guys, I need to add another click event to an element that already has a click handler, perhaps I should save the existing event, unbind the event, make both events ocurr after click? or is there a better way
[11:14:57] <robertmaxrees> why not bind one?
[11:15:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of two, i mean.
[11:15:54] <pthreat> robertmaxrees: It doesn't works
[11:16:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:16:13] <pthreat> because one does one thing and the other one does a completely different thing, I can't code both click events at the same place
[11:16:36] <robertmaxrees> lost as to why you can't have one handler to do both.
[11:16:50] <pthreat> one of them reveals a lightbox, and that's about it, the other event I'm trying to add makes an ajax call
[11:17:06] <robertmaxrees> that should be fine.
[11:17:18] <pthreat> what's your suggestion then
[11:17:27] <robertmaxrees> do both in the same handler
[11:18:35] <pthreat> can't
[11:19:01] <robertmaxrees> then bind two separate ones.  i'd really suggest not juggling event bindings.
[11:19:50] <pthreat> I think the question is how do i bind two different ones then
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> two .on() calls.
[11:22:55] <pthreat> robertmaxrees: I did it that way but I skipped something, it works that way, thanks
[11:23:48] <cjohnson> a job well done, robertmaxrees
[11:24:02] <cjohnson> my favorite kind of support request
[11:33:20] <robertmaxrees> right?
[12:07:47] <Ansikt> Hey, how can I accept any dataType in jQuery.ajax
[12:07:56] <Ansikt> Right now, it seems to fail if it
[12:08:48] <Ansikt> s not application/json.  This is fixed by changing to text/plain, but really that seems like a hack, because in my case I really only care if I get a 200, not what the content of the response is
[12:37:27] <dropdrive> If I call $("form").submit(functionA) and $("form").submit(functionB), should I expect functionA to be replaced by functionB?  Or would both trigger?
[12:44:09] <Cork> dropdrive: both
[12:44:15] <Cork> in the order you've bound them
[12:44:58] <dropdrive> Cork: Interesting, thanks.  So I would have to .off("submit") if I wanted to replace A with B.
[12:45:17] <Cork> dropdrive: or .off(functionA)
[12:45:35] <Cork> but yes
[12:45:40] <dropdrive> Cork: Okay, thanks!
[12:46:21] <Cork> dropdrive: that said though, you should not control logic by switching event handlers
[12:46:42] <dropdrive> Cork: I see, should do it with a variable or something?
[12:46:44] <Cork> just have a toggle you check for in the handler
[12:46:47] <Cork> yes
[12:47:05] <Cork> for example $('form').data('route', 'a')
[12:47:07] <Cork> for example $('form').data('route', 'b')
[12:47:16] <Cork> or what ever format you want to use :)
[12:47:25] <dropdrive> Cork: Good suggestion, thanks.  Actually what I have is that a form should be disabled until a certain getJSON call handler has finished.
[12:47:47] <Cork> dropdrive: $('form').data('disabled', true)
[12:47:55] <Cork> or just set disabled on the submit button
[12:48:09] <Cork> <button disabled></button>
[12:48:29] <Cork> that should prevent the submit event from firing
[13:00:26] <rhalff> is there a standard kind of lib turning jquery plugins into commonjs modules?
[13:00:57] <rhalff> would be nice if all plugins are added to npm without plugin authors having to do anything.
[13:01:09] <rhalff> or are jquery plugins to diverse to do this in one common way?

[13:36:27] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[13:37:54] <DjMadness> i'm just playing around with making different evalidation errors, and thought going that route would be a good idea
[13:38:13] <robertmaxrees> you can access the underlying DOM node and set it on that instead.
[13:40:22] <DjMadness> ye i figgured as much, i was just checking if there was some jquery equiviliant so i could use that instead :) but thanks

[13:56:09] <kokut> Hello, i need to add another form to fetch data for this ajax jquery, http://pastebin.com/Z6VNSVu8, right now its var $form = $("#formid");
[13:56:45] <kokut> I don't need the data to be serialized (i'm not sure what's the use of that anyways)
[13:56:58] <kokut> and the other form contains file data
[14:02:39] <igcewieling1> kokut: in your case it means "make it able to be used with ajax"
[14:03:12] <kokut> igcewieling1: well its just that I don't know another way of sending two forms with PHP..
[14:03:59] <igcewieling1> Maybe I missed something.  You say you don't need the data to be serialized, but if you want to send it over an ajax call you want to serialize it.
[14:04:04] <kokut> someone suggested it was possible with jQuery/ajax so im following that advice
[14:04:46] <kokut> well i dont even know whats the point of serializing it, im a complete noob with jQuery/ajax
[14:05:03] <kokut> so yea, the thing is i need to send files too
[14:05:17] <igcewieling1> kokut: serialize means turn form data into a format which can be sent to the server.  You need it.
[14:05:34] <kokut> ok but what about the files
[14:07:05] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:07:43] * jphase waves
[14:10:45] <jesmith> How do you reference the received object in a jquery sortable on the "receive" event
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> ui.item i'm guessing
[14:14:21] <jesmith> I tried that, but it seems to reference the jquery object that is where the item came from
[14:14:37] <jesmith> I really need to reference the helper that got recevied
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> ui.item is supposed to be the current dragged element - do you have a simple example of what you're doing?
[14:22:50] <krambiorix> i have a div with multiple divs inside it. The outer div has a height of 1200px set on it. I want to know the actual height of the div based on its content. Anyone?
[14:27:35] <NoiseEee> $('outerDiv').css('height');   should return the true getComputedStyle, krambiorix
[14:28:32] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, that returns the height set on the element
[14:28:49] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, i want the height based on the content of the div
[14:29:08] <jakesy> is $(thing).height() not working?
[14:30:02] <krambiorix> jakesy, yes but that gives me the height of the css
[14:30:54] <jakesy> the docs say it gives computed height
[14:31:07] <NoiseEee> yeah weird it doesn't seem to though
[14:31:29] <jakesy> so you have a statically heighted parent with a dynamic number of children, and you want to find the sum of the heights of children?
[14:32:14] <krambiorix> jakesy, exactly
[14:32:43] <krambiorix> but the divs can stand next to each other so i can't loop through them and sum them
[14:32:57] <jesmith> robertmaxrees: so the ui.item (when I debug via chrome) points to the original draggable not the helper on it.
[14:33:09] <robertmaxrees> jesmith are you looking for a function?
[14:33:40] <jesmith> So what I need to do is append content to the received item during the receive
[14:34:32] <jakesy> not necessarily, you can do Math.floor(children.length / Math.floor(child.width() / parent.width()))
[14:34:56] <jakesy> er, ceil rather
[14:35:12] <krambiorix> jakesy, i'm not following
[14:35:39] <jakesy> you can still sum the heights of the children, but youd first have to calculate the number of rows
[14:36:55] <krambiorix> jakesy, so that code ... should i put it in a loop?
[14:37:34] <jakesy> no, just get the number of children, their widths, and the width of the parent
[14:38:13] <jakesy> hopefully they're uniform in size but even if they aren't you can still figure it out
[14:39:48] <krambiorix> jakesy :  Math.floor(children.length / Math.floor(child.width() / parent.width()))
[14:40:36] <jakesy> well it will be more complicated than that, youll need to post your HTML/CSS on jsfiddle or something for me to really help you out
[14:41:35] <krambiorix> jakesy :  http://jsfiddle.net/Launyexz/1/
[14:43:23] <jakesy> these divs are nested, not siblings
[14:44:38] <krambiorix> jakesy , wait
[14:46:47] <krambiorix> jakesy, http://jsfiddle.net/Launyexz/2/
[14:50:34] <brettfrable> anyone wanna do this
[14:50:35] <brettfrable> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-FiMVjMNqV1U2R3NTM1cGRWejA/view?usp=sharing
[14:51:15] <jakesy> whats in it for me
[14:53:10] <jakesy> krambiorix: like maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Launyexz/3/
[14:55:23] <krambiorix> jakesy, so the actual height is 3882?!
[14:55:35] <jakesy> OOPS lol http://jsfiddle.net/Launyexz/4/
[14:56:42] <krambiorix> jakesy, thanks a lot for your help
[14:56:50] <krambiorix> jakesy, the question is: is it fault proof
[14:57:27] <jakesy> good luck, and no not even close haha. it would have to be tailor-written to how your CSS works
[14:58:54] <brettfrable> jakesy 25 - 50 bucks
[15:00:15] <krambiorix> jakesy, thanks man!
[15:06:05] <krambiorix> jakesy, what if divs on top of each other?
[15:08:09] <krambiorix> jakesy, i mean with z-indexes?:)
[15:14:21] <kokut> Hello, I need some help with this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28035056/post-more-than-one-form-with-files-with-jquery-ajax I'm sure its extremely easy to do I'm just too new to jQuery/ajax
[15:52:54] <adamellsworth> is $().replaceWith() meant to reorder elements in the dom?
[15:53:58] <adamellsworth> like if you have five li elements and you replace one with $('li#3).replaceWith($('<li/>', {}).addClass('changed'))
[16:05:06] <gnarf> adamellsworth: it should replace in place the one you had selected with the one you created
[16:05:34] <adamellsworth> yeah, I'm not sure what's going on in my code. i tested it in jsbin and it doesn't re-arrange so
[16:09:38] <baako> hi guys. what can't that alert work? http://kopy.io/Wpvf4
[16:10:11] <baako> basically want i want to do is call the table_check function on submit
[16:18:31] <baako> anyone please
[16:18:37] <robertmaxrees> what was the question?
[16:19:31] <baako> robertmaxrees: i am trying to trigger ajax event automatiicaly when val is over 20
[16:20:06] <baako> i tried it like this http://kopy.io/a7CAJ
[16:20:20] <baako> but the alert didnt work
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> whent he value is over 20 or the length is over 20?
[16:20:34] <baako> which i think that function aint called
[16:20:41] <baako> sorry length
[16:20:45] <robertmaxrees> and $('#tablecheck').submit(table_check); doesn't do what you think it does.
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> that's binding a submit listener.
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> you want to just do table_check();
[16:21:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: so how i do it?
[16:21:38] <robertmaxrees> http://kopy.io/gjBOW
[16:23:29] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:37:32] <ubootu> I have this issue where I cannot seem to get the tab pane to show on click http://jsfiddle.net/8vchjcap/
[16:38:48] <simon> hi. I have two functions, fetchA() and fetchB(), one depends on the other having finished, but both use asynchronous ajax. how do I chain them together without adding one to the tail of the other's success handler?
[16:39:15] <robertmaxrees> simon that's about all you can do.
[16:39:25] <robertmaxrees> look at deferreds, but that'll basically do the same thing.
[16:39:37] <simon> I'm thinking $.ajax(...).done(parseA).something(function() { $.ajax(...).done(parseB); })?
[16:39:51] <simon> robertmaxrees, oh, Deferred is convenience functions for doing this?
[16:39:59] <robertmaxrees> deferreds basically means using .don()
[16:40:03] <robertmaxrees> *.done()
[16:40:04] <robertmaxrees> (sort of)
[16:40:42] <simon> okay.
[16:40:45] <robertmaxrees> var myAjaxCall = $.ajax();  myAjaxCall.done(someOtherFunctionCall);
[16:41:34] <simon> if I do foo.done(bar).done(baz), does this mean that both bar and baz will trigger when foo is done?
[16:42:12] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:44:43] <robertmaxrees> but not in any particular order.
[16:57:56] <gnarf> robertmaxrees: actually order is determinite, order in which they are added
[16:57:58] <gnarf> but really
[16:58:03] <gnarf> you want something more like
[16:58:14] <robertmaxrees> *order things finish, i should say.
[16:58:29] <robertmaxrees> all the .done() callbacks registered are effectively fired at once, right?
[16:59:02] <gnarf> $.ajax().then(function(data1) { return $.ajax().then(function(data2) { return { first: data1, second: data2 }}_; }).then(function(both) { both.first; both.second; })
[16:59:24] <gnarf> cc simon: ^
[17:01:15] <simon> gnarf, thanks a lot! I was wondering about .then().
[17:01:54] <gnarf> simon: "then" is kinda like an async "|" in unix -- take in the input, return new output
[17:02:08] <gnarf> only its promise aware
[17:05:14] <robertmaxrees> poetic
[17:18:57] <simon> gnarf, is it correctly understood that $.ajax(...).done(foo, bar) first runs foo and then runs bar?
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[17:19:56] <robertmaxrees> it'll call foo, then bar, but it doesn't necessarily wait for foo to complete before calling bar.
[17:20:17] <shoky> it necessarily doesn't wait :P
[17:20:17] <simon> robertmaxrees, when the docs refer to deferred, should I assume that my current use of .done() uses "deferred functionality" or must I explicitly import support for deferred?
[17:20:31] <simon> okay.
[17:20:32] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() returns a deferred object.
[17:20:39] <simon> cool.
[17:21:00] <robertmaxrees> so when you do $.ajax().done(), you're using http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[17:21:08] <simon> thanks - I should have been more explicit about the intent of my question, but you guessed it. :)
[17:22:11] <simon> gnarf, difference between unix pipes and .then() must be that it doesn't send parts of the result down the pipe as it arrives, right?
[17:24:40] <simon> https://gist.github.com/sshine/fe5ddf9c3763583e0c10 - I miss monads.
[17:25:59] <shoky> simon that's true, though jquery's deferred's have the option to use progress callbacks. hardly the same thing though, and i've no idea how/if $.ajax uses those
[17:30:36] <simon> shoky, that's pretty cool, I guess.
[18:13:08] <snufft_> hi guys!
[18:14:04] <snufft_> does anyone know if there is a jquery plugin which will let you search a table by multiple columns, as well as sort results alphabetically, all from the UI?
[18:42:09] <bonhoeffer> hey - i have a popup that is loaded via ajax — how could i call jquery select on that
[18:43:46] <simon> bonhoeffer, is the popup a DOM element or a separate window?
[18:44:03] <bonhoeffer> dom element that is filled in via ajax i believe
[18:44:08] <bonhoeffer> checking . . .
[18:45:25] <bonhoeffer> ok — this calls it: https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/1057c7c92e55d18a50f6
[18:45:54] <bonhoeffer> and populates it — and i want to run $(‘#myid’).hide() on something in that form
[18:47:44] <simon> can't you .find("#myid").hide()?
[18:49:23] <Sylints> Hello
[18:49:49] <Sylints> Anyone available to answer what I'm hoping is a simple question?
[18:51:10] <Sylints> Bueller?
[18:56:59] <jesmith> can you bind a function to a element in the rowCallback of a datatable?
[20:19:40] <simon> on http://stackoverflow.com/a/10213645/235908 it says that the preferred method to check if something is selected is simply 'this.selected', rather than the jQuery $(this).is(':selected'), and it seems clear to me why. but is this cross-browser compatible?
[20:20:56] <SirLagz> simon: do you mean is the jQuery way cross-browser compatible ?
[20:28:10] <simon> SirLagz, no, I mean, is 'this.selected' fine?
[20:28:27] <SirLagz> simon: I wouldn't. I'd use the jquery way to ensure that it works
[21:01:09] <root3d> can i sort a hashmap key by specific order ? for eg..arrange the keys of hashmap as per an string of array
[21:01:33] <root3d> in underscore js there is sortBy method, i am wondering if there is something in jquery
[21:12:29] <reynierpm> how I append to div#cloned each TR where checkbox is checked? I have this code http://jsbin.com/xinalomaki/1/edit?js,console,output but do not find a way to achieve this
[21:12:34] <reynierpm> can any give me some help?
[21:29:16] <Guest8667> I am very challenged at this, I am trying to write a piece of code that can tell me what versions of query I am running on a page
[21:29:54] <Guest8667> I can figure out only the first one, but no idea how to deal with any others that are using the noConflict
[21:30:50] <Guest8667> is it possible to see how many versions of jQuery are running on one page?
[21:36:49] <systemfault> Not really.
[21:36:58] <Guest8667> is it possible to determine if query has been loaded by other means than its jQuery or $ names?
[21:37:20] <systemfault> Not that I know, no.
[21:37:49] <systemfault> We need to thank the shitty "everything is global" model of client-side JavaScript for this.

[22:22:22] <arup_r> Can we use relative url while making Ajax reuqest ?
[22:22:38] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/ae4ccdf799e82697a6c7
[22:23:00] <arup_r> I am using full url.. But I need to use relative url.. Is this possible ?
[23:27:55] <Cork> arup_r: yes you can
[23:28:08] <Cork> arup_r: you can always use relative urls in webpages
[23:28:18] <Cork> except for websocket
[23:28:47] <arup_r> Thanks.. I forgot I asked here.. Suddenly got panicked.. after seeing your message notification :)
[23:29:26] <arup_r> Should I use url: "/search" or url: "/clients/search"
[23:29:28] <arup_r> ?
[23:29:33] <arup_r> Cork: ^^
[23:29:47] <Cork> those aren't relative
[23:29:52] <Cork> those are absolute
[23:30:06] <Cork> "search" would be relative to the current page
[23:30:22] <Cork> "/search" would be absolute for the current domain address (this is what you normally want to use)
[23:31:29] <arup_r> I am very new in Jquery/JS I am working in a Ruby on Rails project
[23:31:57] <arup_r> can you tell me what will be actual url when I will write "search" and when "/search" ?
[23:33:54] <Cork> arup_r: if your current url is "http://example.com/services/1000"
[23:34:18] <Cork> arup_r: then "search" will be "http://example.com/services/1000/search" and "/search" will be "http://example.com/search"
[23:34:35] <arup_r> Ok
[23:34:57] <Cork> and you normally want to use absolute urls
[23:35:17] <Cork> cause else you have to rewrite them if you move them between files
[23:35:33] <arup_r> I am in the page http://localhost:3000/clients/new and I want to issue an ajax request... so I need to use "/clients/search".. Correct??
[23:36:06] <Cork> arup_r: just give the url from rails and use url_for
[23:36:08] <arup_r> to make the ajax call http://localhost:3000/clients/search
[23:36:23] <arup_r> No. it is not possible...
[23:36:33] <Cork> interesting...
[23:36:35] <arup_r> because my .js file is in the public/ folder
[23:36:53] <Cork> you could set the url in a form tag (you should anyway)
[23:37:01] <arup_r> those url helper works if I am inside the views/ folder
[23:37:25] <arup_r> My .js will be called when the page load will be completed..
[23:37:27] <Cork> and then you just have to do $.ajax(form.action)
[23:37:36] <Cork> O_o
[23:37:47] <arup_r> Don't make me confuse :(
[23:37:50] <arup_r> :)
[23:38:02] <Cork> oook...
[23:38:03] <arup_r> I'll use url: "/clients/search"
[23:38:10] <arup_r> Hope it will work
[23:40:20] <MeiR-> what about dots?
[23:40:35] <MeiR-> "../search"
[23:40:36] <Cork> "./search" is the same thing as "search"
[23:40:39] <Cork> ah
[23:40:44] <Cork> still relative
[23:40:55] <MeiR-> but he wanted relative, didn't he?
[23:41:04] <Cork> MeiR-: but for the restful urls you don't want to use relative
[23:41:13] <Cork> it becomes a world of pain
[23:41:35] <MeiR-> i find it useful when it's a sub directory
[23:42:05] <MeiR-> 'cause whenever i move the whole project, i don't need to mind about renaming paths
[23:42:17] <Cork> MeiR-: restful uses ex clients/, clients/new, clients/100 clients/100/other_action
[23:42:29] <Cork> so relative will cause breakage
[23:42:54] <MeiR-> ok. actually, i've never started to use REST
[23:43:29] <Cork> for none restful it is more ok, as you normally have much more control over the url structure
[23:43:50] <Cork> but relative is often a pain and should be avoided most of the time
[23:44:38] <MeiR-> found a documented answer here: https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.org/en/latest/urls.html#relative-vs-absolute
[23:46:40] <arup_r> umm.. nice
