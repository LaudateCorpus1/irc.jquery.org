[03:37:53] <z16> Hey, is there any way to find out if the Windows key was pressed during a click event?
[03:37:56] <z16> http://api.jquery.com/event.metaKey/
[03:38:01] <z16> The demo on this site does not work
[03:38:19] <z16> Always returns "false" on Win7 + Firefox
[03:41:37] <bacobart> is that even supported by browsers?
[03:41:43] <bacobart> it doesnt work in any browser on win8 for me
[03:43:05] <z16> bacobart: I don't know if it works with jQuery, it works with regular JS
[03:43:15] <z16> The MouseEvent has a metaKey property, which is set correctly for me
[03:43:30] <z16> (I.e. true when the Windows key is pressed, false if not)
[03:43:44] <bacobart> yeah i see it should be supported
[03:43:52] <bacobart> but the jquery doesnt work for me in any browser;p
[03:44:00] <bacobart> so maybe jquery's broken idk
[03:44:36] <z16> Maybe, I haven't used it much yet, so Idk
[03:44:53] <bacobart> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_event_mouse_metakey
[03:44:58] <bacobart> doesnt work for me either
[03:45:49] <z16> Er hm
[03:45:54] <z16> Now it doesn't work for me either <<
[03:46:01] <z16> Maybe I screwed up my test earlier
[03:46:06] <z16> window.onclick = function(e) { alert(e.metaKey) };
[03:46:11] <z16> This is what I used, I thought
[03:46:40] <z16> But now that does not seem to work... Maybe I was still testing with Ctrl at that point
[05:22:35] <agile_prg> how can I .click() in an iframe with a div id of route_1 ?
[05:30:37] <_cb> If anyone has used Jquery to send data to GO can you tell me how?  $.post which I have used with PHP does not seem to work with GO
[06:02:23] <DRSK> How do I fetch the closest desc multiple of 15? If I have 29 I'd want to get 15. if I have 30, then 30. 35? 30. 46? 45.
[06:03:01] <z16> DRSK: Math.floor(x / 15) * 15
[06:03:10] <DRSK> ah thanks
[06:27:41] <CoolApps> I think I've found a bug in JQuery, though I would like to check here if it is really.
[06:28:51] <CoolApps> So, I've noticed when applying 'transform: translate3d( 0, 0, 0 )' to the body of the document (CSS), slideToggle() timer looks as if it becomes stuck on 'fast' until the CSS gets removed.
[06:29:18] <CoolApps> I've tried extending the timer on slideToggle() and it still was doing the animation fast.
[06:29:35] <CoolApps> Removing that code from the CSS made it work again.
[06:30:07] <CoolApps> Could it be possible that it could be breaking the timer in slideToggle()?
[06:58:50] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/0cx6atq0/ is there a better way to handle the localstorage? I'm planning on having at least 3 "movable/draggable" elements with their position stored..
[07:05:29] <teza19> Hello, I'm going to have a list of servers in a table, and i'd like to be able to delete the 'id'. I understand the ajax components, however I'm struggling to get the ID of the server. --> http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/1/
[07:10:08] <arc_> teza first of all your click handler is pointing to a class that doesn't exist. second of all on line 4 you are using $(this) even though you are trying to find the id of the row
[07:10:55] <rfc19> arc_: fair point, sorry. I changed the class names
[07:11:36] <rfc19> arc_: I'm trying to find the ID of a <span> element within a 'td'
[07:11:47] <rfc19> http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/2/ <-- updated for correct class element.
[07:15:14] <rfc19> arc_: what should I use instead of $(this)
[07:18:37] <arc_> rfc19 http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/5/
[07:19:45] <rfc19> arc_: brilliant, thank you
[07:21:14] <arc_> depending on your application, you can also do find('span.server') or find('.server')
[07:21:29] <rfc19> arc_: what if we run something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/7/
[07:21:49] <rfc19> I'm just trying to learn and understand the functions
[07:22:51] <arc_> rfc19 http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/8/
[07:23:17] <rfc19> arc_: great, thank you
[07:23:22] <arc_> np
[07:34:12] <rfc19> arc_: how can I get the content to disappear? I've tried .text('') but it doesn't remove the delete button
[07:34:51] <arc_> does it need to be removed from dom or can it just be hidden
[07:35:23] <rfc19> it can be hidden, because I'll be removing it from a database that'll stop it from displaying again
[07:35:52] <arc_> then you can just use hide()
[07:37:48] <arc_> if you're trying to hide both the server and the delete button, it would be easier if they were both wrapped in a unique parent element
[07:37:55] <arc_> if that's not possible, you can still do it, but it's just more code
[07:38:16] <rfc19> let me see if I can put all this data in a table cell
[07:40:47] <rfc19> doesn't look that great
[07:41:18] <arc_> i mean, you could just put it in a div with no margins or padding
[07:42:15] <arc_> actually ... why is there an extra span tag here
[07:42:34] <arc_> you have a close span tag after the server ip address
[07:42:46] <arc_> if you remove that, the button will be enclosed in the same span as the data
[07:43:02] <arc_> so you could just hide that span and be done with it
[07:43:17] <rfc19> it's ok, I changed the layout. I'll update the fiddle
[07:44:05] <rfc19> http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/9/
[07:45:08] <rfc19> oops, I didn't close the <td>.. but you get the idea!
[07:46:12] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/10/
[07:48:00] <rfc19> arc_: wow, that's great. I need to brush up on my JQuery
[07:48:39] <rfc19> Thanks again
[07:49:05] <arc_> you can also do $(this).closest('tr').hide();
[07:49:12] <arc_> i don't know which one is considered better to do :p
[07:49:22] <rfc19> haha, that's ok.. that's working well for me!
[07:54:43] <rfc19> is there  way to detect when all rows are gone?
[07:55:12] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I have a container that is filled with text from an ajax call, so the height can vary.. is there a way to calculate the height of the box so it always shows all content without overflow?
[07:56:07] <arc_> rfc19 length()
[07:57:53] <KnightsOfNi> height: auto does not do the trick
[07:57:57] <arc_> oh sorry it's just length not length()
[07:58:44] <rfc19> arc_: on which section? I tried applying the length function to the end of the 'find' element, but it still has a length of '1'
[07:59:31] <arc_> actually wait. you're not removing it from dom you're just hiding it
[08:00:01] <arc_> you should remove it from dom if you want to do it this way
[08:00:13] <arc_> unless that is not what you want for some other reason
[08:00:16] <rfc19> I see!
[08:00:28] <rfc19> I don't see a problem with that at all
[08:00:36] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/v2juc9wz/11/
[08:01:16] <arc_> length returns the total number of elements in the jquery object, whether they are hidden or not
[08:01:55] <arc_> if you didn't want to remove from dom, you would have to do a loop that counts the number of visible objects
[08:04:22] <rfc19> understood, that works great. Thank you
[08:04:36] <arc_> np
[08:10:15] <arc_> KnightsOfNi it depends on the layout of the site
[08:11:03] <arc_> height: auto; overflow: hidden; might work

[08:49:53] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, is there a way to avoid doing things like $('<div></div>') for creating new content? For example have some hidden html and append show it where it's needed?
[08:51:06] <KnightsOfNi>  I created a div with display:none and then did the following: $block.append($('#mynewstuff').show()); but it shows the html itself

[12:22:06] <Uhkis> thanks for your opinion, now move on
[12:28:33] <pauled> I need help please, trying to remove parent element that contain text http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/8k8vnxdc/
[12:36:09] <Uhkis> pauled: http://fiddle.jshell.net/8k8vnxdc/2/ like this?
[12:37:08] <pauled> Uhkis: thanks, no, I want to remove element that contain '(foo)'
[12:37:19] <pauled> the parent*
[12:38:14] <Uhkis> the span only?
[12:40:20] <pauled> the div.parent
[12:40:49] <Uhkis> that's exactly what my fiddle did?
[12:41:36] <pauled> no, it keep foo and it remove bar, I want the opposite
[12:41:56] <pauled> it find foo and it remove it
[12:43:01] <pauled> Uhkis: ah sorry, this is exactly
[12:43:06] <Uhkis> yes, that's still exactly what it did :D
[12:43:55] <Palmer11> $(this).parent().remove();
[12:44:01] <Palmer11> should be all you need
[12:44:04] <pauled> I'm tired, I need to sleep, I have not the eyes in front of her holes :)
[12:47:10] <pauled> Palmer11: yes but it keep the div .parent empty
[12:47:38] <pauled> what Uhkis do is what I am looking
[12:47:45] <pauled> thanks :)
[12:50:53] <Palmer11> then parent().parent()
[12:55:57] <pauled> yes it work too http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/8k8vnxdc/4/ thanks :)
[12:56:42] <Uhkis> please god don't do that
[12:56:56] <pauled> yes it's ugly ;(
[12:57:19] <pauled> tried with get() but doesn't work
[12:57:23] <Uhkis> and the smallest change in html will break it
[12:57:31] <pauled> yes true
[13:03:28] <sillyslux> changing one css class name is a very small change in html - and can break a lot, that's live
[13:16:51] <pauled> it's rare to see a class changed than an element removed or added.
[13:18:56] <pauled> thanks guys, long live to jquery :)
[13:19:08] <pauled> click!
[13:34:08] <t4nk017> Hi
[13:35:08] <t4nk017> can sb help me (noob question for scripting) ?
[13:36:08] <Palmer11> just ask
[13:36:40] <t4nk017> I added jqueryUI for selectable blocks
[13:37:09] <t4nk017> i made a var selectedBlock = $(".block.ui-selected");
[13:37:35] <t4nk017> but selectedBlock.css(...); doesn't work :/
[13:38:02] <Palmer11> why are you doing css in jquery?
[13:38:18] <t4nk017> just an exemple
[13:38:35] <Palmer11> well, you should just addClass or removeClass
[13:38:48] <Palmer11> and do the css in a stylesheet
[13:39:13] <t4nk017> yeah yeah, but just want to understand why i can't use the selected object in a variable
[13:39:49] <Palmer11> you should be able to. You might need to override the content with jqueryUI, if it has any
[13:40:29] <t4nk017> that's why i try to make it works with the basic function : css()
[13:40:37] <t4nk017> but it doesn't...
[13:41:01] <t4nk017> $selectedBlock.css("background","red"); doesn't make the bloc became red
[13:42:07] <Palmer11> its var $selectedBlock
[13:42:19] <t4nk017> yes
[13:42:29] <Palmer11> you didn’t put that
[13:43:02] <t4nk017> yes, i added a $
[13:43:17] <Palmer11> then it should see it
[13:43:17] <t4nk017> (because the var just contain the selected object)
[13:44:40] <ashgotti> Afternoon everyone. I need a bit of help with a few simple things. I have input fields I use to do calculations. When the fields are empty/null, I get NaN error. I set the default value of the fields to '0' to avoid this but is there a way to set up my code that says if the value is "Null", it should equal '0'? I tried doing 'total = field1 || 0 + field2 || 0' but it doesn't work.
[13:46:42] <Palmer11> if($el != 0 || null) { $el = 0; }
[13:47:10] <Palmer11> if($el != 0 || $el != null)
[13:47:24] <ashgotti> I have +12 variables, is there a shortened version of that? I think if I add '|| 0' to the end of my var declarations, that shoudl do it.
[13:48:42] <Palmer11> function check($el) { if($el != 0 || $el != null) { return 0; } }
[13:48:43] <ashgotti> Yup that did it :)
[13:48:56] <ashgotti> oh that's good too. I can add them to an array and check the array
[13:49:57] <ashgotti> This brings me to my next question: These fields will be used for currency. I'd like to mask them to automatically add commas where necessary and add the cents suffix. I added jquery.maskMoney() but it breaks my calculations. Any ideas why or alternatives?
[14:01:51] <ashgotti> Just tried another jquery mask plugin and had the same issue. I wonder if there is a way to use masks and perform calculations
[14:03:50] <Palmer11> seems like jquery isn’t the problem, if two methods havn’t worked
[14:04:16] <ashgotti> The mask works but my calculations break when I enable it.
[14:04:29] <Palmer11> so your math is wrong
[14:05:06] <Palmer11> check the logs
[14:05:34] <ashgotti> Calculations work without the masks though.
[14:06:52] <Palmer11> prob should quit life then
[14:07:17] <ashgotti> Helpful
[14:08:05] <Palmer11> solves the problem
[14:08:32] <cortexman> how can i deselect the text in a textarea
[14:08:38] <cortexman> i've tried like 10 approaches from google
[14:09:28] <Palmer11> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+deselect+textarea
[14:09:46] <ashgotti> Palmer11--
[14:10:30] <Palmer11> idk what to say. look through everything. You clearly have a issues somewhere.
[14:10:49] <ashgotti> Again, very helpful. You know, you don't have to reply if you don't actually have anything helpful to contribute.
[14:11:02] <Palmer11> wtf do you expect?
[14:11:07] <Palmer11> you don’t post code
[14:11:19] <Palmer11> you don’t post a running example
[14:11:25] <Palmer11> how can someone help if nothing is provided
[14:11:33] <ashgotti> oh ok, that's why you're a dick.
[14:11:35] <Palmer11> all you can get is ideas
[14:11:40] <Uhkis> and you asked for code where?
[14:11:47] <Palmer11> don’t need to ask
[14:11:58] <ashgotti> You don't give ideas. lmgtfy and "you have issues somewhere" is not ideas.
[14:11:59] <Palmer11> if you ask for help, you should provide what you need help with
[14:12:10] <ashgotti> oh ok, that's why you're a dick.
[14:12:33] <Palmer11> well, give more information next time
[14:12:59] <sillyslux> he tried like 10 approaches from google, so google search is not what he needs help with ^^
[14:13:59] <ashgotti> Anyways, incase anyone else has a problem with masks + calculations (I wasn't the only one from google results), this formatter works https://www.customd.com/articles/11/jquery-number-format
[14:14:06] <sillyslux> an example on jsfiddle would be nice thou
[14:16:53] <sillyslux> cortexman can it be that the text somehow gets selected after you deselect it?
[14:17:09] <cortexman> no that's not it
[14:17:25] <cortexman> i managed to get it working by using onselect="deselect()" and then putting the code directly inside a script tag
[14:17:29] <sillyslux> what about jsfiddle?
[14:17:36] <cortexman> the code being, ta.text(ta.text());
[14:18:33] <cortexman> sec
[14:18:49] <sillyslux> sec me too
[14:18:54] * sillyslux afk
[14:22:56] <cortexman> here is a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/u8e2gq2d/
[14:23:23] <cortexman> when a user presses ctrl+a, i don't want the text to remain selected
[14:24:42] <sillyslux> catch keypress and preventdefault?
[14:25:15] <sillyslux> you don't want the text to become selected?
[14:25:45] <cortexman> that's right, i don't want the text to become selected
[14:25:55] <cortexman> i tried every single recommendation on google
[14:29:23] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/u8e2gq2d/4/
[14:30:47] <cortexman> nice
[14:31:07] <cortexman> i wonder if ctrl+a will still work in mousetrap
[14:31:19] <cortexman> sec
[14:32:21] <cortexman> it totally does. thanks a lot sillyslux https://jsfiddle.net/u8e2gq2d/9/
[14:33:46] <sillyslux> cool
[14:33:55] <cortexman> is there a way to access my textarea in the js console on jfiddle?
[14:34:49] <sillyslux> inspect element, then in console enter $0
[14:35:47] <cortexman> that prints null
[14:36:24] <sillyslux> true that.. in chrome
[14:36:26] <sillyslux> works in ff
[14:36:28] <cortexman> that's alright
[14:36:40] <cortexman> does kinda make jsfiddle a lot less useful in chrome
[14:38:00] <sillyslux> uff.. but iframes in ff can't access offline storage, which works in chrome
[14:38:51] <Cyberuben> Hi, I'm currently working on a Joomla website, however, after updating it my NivoSlider doesn't work anymore and I can't seem to figure out how. I hoped someone here would be able to resolve the ".nivoSlider is not a function" error: http://www.dev.optiekvandevecht.nl/
[15:25:53] <sillyslux> Cyberuben you're defining jQuery three times
[15:26:23] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: That's because almost every frontend Joomla module has it's own jQuery include, I can't really do anything against that...
[15:28:37] <sillyslux> after a first jQuery instance got nivoslider it was reset in /templates/optiek11/script.js
[15:29:08] <sillyslux> you really can do something about it
[15:29:11] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: So what would the easy fix be?
[15:29:18] <sillyslux> if you really want this to work
[15:29:39] <sillyslux> remove jquery from script.js
[15:31:16] <sillyslux> no not that one
[15:31:18] <Cyberuben> I'm not sure how I'd do that
[15:31:30] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: I just see functions that use jQuery, not jQuery itself...
[15:34:39] <Cyberuben> Getting really fed up over this one, been working on it for three hours already
[15:37:52] <sillyslux> first remove the last jquery (1.10.2.min.js)
[15:38:41] <sillyslux> btw, i don't know joomla
[15:39:13] <Cyberuben> Let me find it
[15:39:21] <Cyberuben> I know, but it's not really Joomla that's the problem
[15:40:52] <sillyslux> i guess joomla creates the html head for you, so you would have to configure it or it's plugins to leave that one out
[15:42:45] <sillyslux> it's the one from http://static.fliphtml5.com/
[15:42:47] <Cyberuben> It creates a part of it, indeed. The latest jquery.1.10.2 is loaded by a plugin btu I can't find it
[15:42:57] <Cyberuben> I'm looking in the files but it doesn't seem to be in any of them
[15:43:18] <sillyslux> it'a loaded from another server
[15:44:39] <sillyslux> plugins/system/jch_optimize/libs/jscss.php loads mootools and i think yet another jquery too
[15:46:25] <sillyslux> that would be 1.11.1
[15:47:32] <Cyberuben> Ugh...
[15:47:35] <Cyberuben> Such a stuggle
[15:47:56] <sillyslux> but that 2nd jquery doesn't hurt because novislider comes after
[15:48:34] <Cyberuben> The thing is, if it includes it from another server, I still should be able to find it
[15:49:15] <sillyslux> fliphtml5
[15:49:59] <Cyberuben> Yeah, I know, but I can't find it anywhere
[15:50:59] <sillyslux> look closely
[15:55:56] <Cyberuben> downloading the .zip installer to find a clue
[15:56:03] <Cyberuben> Searching it individually is a pain
[16:04:55] <Cyberuben> I think I found the problem...
[16:05:13] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: It wasn't jQuery, it was another include of nivoslider by the html5flippingbook plugin, I guess...
[16:07:37] <sillyslux> then novi shouldn't be undefined
[16:07:56] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: I don't know, honestly. I just made a lot of changes, didn't change a thing, until I uncommented this line
[16:08:10] <Cyberuben> <script src='http://fliphtml5.com/plugin/LightBox/js/fliphtml5-light-box-api-min.js'></script>
[16:08:15] <sillyslux> does it work now?
[16:08:20] <Cyberuben> commented*
[16:08:38] <Cyberuben> It seems like it...
[16:10:01] <sillyslux> the jquery 1.10.2 is gone
[16:10:32] <Cyberuben> It was already while the errors still occured
[16:10:55] <Cyberuben> At least, I checked it and it wasn't there, slider still wasn't working
[16:11:02] <Cyberuben> Didn't really pay attention to the error at that point, if I'm honest
[16:12:33] <sillyslux> what ever.. at least it work now :)
[16:13:17] <Cyberuben> That's what counts, indeed. Thanks for the help at least. I'm not that good with debugging jQuery. I pretty much get paid to update shitty Joomla sites to even shittier Joomla sites, because updates break everything, and jQuery errors are the worst of all to solve
[16:14:50] <sillyslux> as long as it pays...
[16:15:15] <Cyberuben> sillyslux: I literally do this work when I can't be arsed to do anything else, it gives me motivation to work on other projects after I finished this
[16:15:47] <sillyslux> :)
[16:15:50] <sillyslux> freelance?
[16:16:12] <Cyberuben> Yes, I work for a company that maintains a lot of Joomla and Wordpress websites
[16:16:35] <Cyberuben> The owner gets a design from someone, builds it using Artisteer (some WYSIWYG Windows application), then installs modules until it does what it's supposed to do
[16:16:56] <Cyberuben> This website is not THAT terrible, but I've had to do some CSS fixed on websites where literally everything is impossible, !important after !important overriding the previous one
[16:17:04] <sillyslux> and hires you to clean that shit up
[16:17:42] <Cyberuben> Uh, I'm one of the four guys he gets to clean thigns up, however, it seems to me that I'm the most competent of all
[16:18:15] <sillyslux> hehe
[16:18:20] <Cyberuben> He literally doesn't know any programming, he just knows basic CSS, not even HTML. Don't ask me how, really, but it's the way he works.
[16:18:24] <sillyslux> if he needs a 5th...
[16:18:38] <Cyberuben> Hahaha
[16:18:46] <Cyberuben> I think he only wants to work with people who are more local
[16:18:55] <sillyslux> nl?
[16:18:58] <Cyberuben> Yes
[16:19:14] <sillyslux> i'd move there
[16:19:18] <Cyberuben> I don't exactly live close to the office, but I'm able to work there for a day if I had to
[16:19:19] * sillyslux grins
[16:19:49] * sillyslux was in Maastricht once
[16:20:02] <sillyslux> oi oi
[16:20:07] <Cyberuben> Well he's got one programmer at the office three days a week, working mainly on their own CRM. The company basically started with a guy who was good at marketing and a good programmer, the programmer got a burnout and sold his share to the other guy, who now runs it on his own
[16:20:51] <sillyslux> maybe it's better i find a job here
[16:21:03] <Cyberuben> Where are you from if I may ask?
[16:21:14] <sillyslux> adriatic sea
[16:21:23] <sillyslux> split, croatia
[16:21:52] <Cyberuben> Ah
[16:22:02] <Cyberuben> Well I'm only 19 years old and I've got myself quite some clients
[16:22:10] <Cyberuben> There always is work for me, I just don't always have the time for work
[16:22:11] <sillyslux> wow
[16:22:32] <sillyslux> i'm more like 38yrs old and have zero clients
[16:22:50] <Cyberuben> That sucks...
[16:23:14] <sillyslux> but here comes the summer and i can go to the beach every day
[16:23:27] <Cyberuben> I'd love that too
[16:23:36] <Cyberuben> I'm not much like a stereotypical programmer, other than the fact I love to work at night
[16:24:02] <sillyslux> i think we're in the same timezone
[16:24:06] <Cyberuben> People who don't know me just see me as an average teenager, haha
[16:24:08] <sillyslux> 01:23
[16:24:09] <Cyberuben> It's 1:24 here
[16:24:11] <Cyberuben> Yeah
[16:24:15] <Cyberuben> GMT +1 DST
[16:26:00] <Cyberuben> Well, in winter it's GMT +1, in summer it's GMT +2, which is due to DST
[16:26:39] <sillyslux> doesn't gb have summertime too?
[16:26:59] <Cyberuben> But I started programming at the age of 15, started my first business with a friend at begin 17, sold my share to my friend end 2013, already had another business along that on my own, started to gain clients of my own and things just set off for me
[16:27:12] <Cyberuben> Yes, so right now the UK is in GMT +1, which is weird because Greenwich is in the UK, I believe
[16:27:20] <sillyslux> wow that's great
[16:27:46] <sillyslux> your business is webdev?
[16:28:07] <Cyberuben> Yes, however I'm a terrible designer so usually stick with Bootstrap
[16:28:10] <sillyslux> or is that more like a side thing
[16:29:14] <Cyberuben> I study International Game Architecture and Design, so I'm practically being trained to become a C++ game developer at high level (a lot of graduates of this study ended up at big studios like Ubisoft and such), also learn C# on the side in some classes, and studied PHP, Java, JavaScript and Lua in my own time
[16:29:29] <Cyberuben> Currently working on a PS4 game in a group project
[16:29:51] <sillyslux> ahh, does it pay?
[16:29:58] <Cyberuben> The game or the webdev?
[16:30:04] <sillyslux> game
[16:30:24] <sillyslux> or is webdev your only income?
[16:30:38] <Cyberuben> No, there is no intention to release the game, it's for educational purposes, however, we're allowed to take the game to contests and keep the prize money ourself
[17:31:44] <lilalinuxKL> how can I make a tr limit in height? http://jsfiddle.net/lilalinux/u0kt7uns/10/

[19:45:01] <rfc19> Hello, I'm trying to find the last 'id' attribute in my table so I can add a value to it. What should I be looking for?
[19:57:18] <R-Ratones> $('table [id]:last')
[20:01:54] <rfc19> R-Ratones: I'm getting 'undefined'
[20:03:48] <arc_> rfc19 what are the ids assigned to
[20:04:31] <arc_> if it's what you were doing earlier, $('span.server').last().attr('id'); should work
[20:06:33] <rfc19> arc_: It was, I'll try that out
[20:07:29] <rfc19> we moved it from <span> to <td>, so I made that change (td.server).. However it's picking up the first ID (1)
[20:07:48] <arc_> is it still in a fiddle
[20:08:58] <rfc19> I'm just setting it up now
[20:09:39] <rfc19> http://jsfiddle.net/5yyac97h/
[20:11:38] <arc_> the ids are both 1 here
[20:12:06] <rfc19> it's been a long day..
[20:12:17] <rfc19> that now works lol
[20:12:20] <arc_> lol ok
[20:12:49] <arc_> here's how i generally troubleshoot selectors like that
[20:13:05] <arc_> just use the first selector and output it to the console log
[20:13:09] <arc_> see what it says
[20:13:14] <arc_> if it works like you expect, add the next selector, and so on
[20:13:25] <arc_> when i did that just now, it showed me that both elements had the same id
[20:13:34] <arc_> so i was like ok why is that, and obviously it was because of the html
[20:15:05] <R-Ratones> and some markup is messed up, there where a few td unclosed
[20:15:18] <arc_> i'm assuming that's just because of quickly setting up a fiddle but
[20:15:28] <arc_> yeah, make sure all that is correct as well
[20:15:36] <rfc19> that's right.. just rushing to get it all in there
[20:15:38] <rfc19> thanks though
[20:16:11] <R-Ratones> here is  a working version using   $('table [id]:last')  http://jsfiddle.net/5yyac97h/3/
[20:16:44] <arc_> i was going to ask if that's a better way of doing it for some reason
[20:26:20] <rfc19> Is there a way I can validate input fields with an AJAX post and present an error if a field already exists?
[20:26:33] <rfc19> I can do that with PHP, but just need to trigger it without refreshing the page
[21:38:49] <pyCasso> looking for an alternative front end templating library that will not break in IE
[23:15:53] <i8igmac> im looking for a example on jsfiddle for when a div is in in center of the screen to trigger a bootstrap image gallery
[23:16:14] <i8igmac> http://jsfiddle.net/XFcSv/564/
[23:16:52] <i8igmac> here is a boot strap image gallery, as you scroll down you will see more. i hope to enable as you scroll down
[23:17:37] <i8igmac> i hope for only one #homeCarousel to be active when the div is in the screen
