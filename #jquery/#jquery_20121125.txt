[02:17:47] <Bauer> I need help - I want to make autocomplete widget, which would only trigger on the second part of email, so a person writes: foo@ - then autocomplete starts working, the moment he types "b" as in: foo@b - and only then autocomplete would offer foo@bar.com
[02:17:50] <Bauer> how to do this?
[02:18:11] <Bauer> I am looking at the documentation for the autocomplete widget in jQueryUI, and cant figure out this use case
[02:18:52] <Suppa_Spic> I have 2 buttons that slideup and slidedown some content, but if the 2 buttons are pressed too fast they show both content, http://jsfiddle.net/3QPpe/

[02:19:08] <Suppa_Spic> I have callbacks to wait for the animations to finish, but it's not enough I thinl :/
[02:21:38] <veQue> whats the best way to set a "flag" for a text input?
[02:21:53] <Lucky--> .addClass
[02:21:54] <Lucky--> ?
[02:22:17] <veQue> that answer is for me?
[02:22:21] <Lucky--> yea
[02:22:29] <veQue> ok thnks i'll check that out
[02:22:29] <Lucky--> well elaborate on flag
[02:22:33] <veQue> ok
[02:22:38] <Lucky--> like highlight it? add data to it?
[02:22:39] <Lucky--> what?
[02:24:08] <veQue> basically i got n text input boxes. Sometimes i need them to be flagged "Output" (if they need to calculate a formula and display).. and other times hey should be flagged "Input" if they just need to behave in a default way(just display whatever user is typing)
[02:24:37] <veQue> hope that makes sense
[02:25:45] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/kFwfJ/
[02:25:46] <Lucky--> why not just write to a span or something for the outputs?
[02:26:06] <veQue> as you can see as i type in 11 bb or cc it flashes NaN
[02:26:23] <veQue> Lucky--:  that's the thing
[02:26:35] <veQue> i need it to do this dynamically
[02:26:48] <veQue> sorry 1 = aa
[02:26:50] <veQue> =P
[02:26:54] <veQue> 11 = aa
[02:27:25] <veQue> everytime i keyup it alternates from NaN to a number in hte other boxes
[02:28:13] <Lucky--> im gonna show you a really easy way to do this, you may be unfamiliar with it, but once u learn it, it'll make js easy for life for yoiu
[02:30:28] <veQue> =)

[04:35:48] <^^juan^^> morning! I'm trying to retrieve my Instantgram images and after find an script that retrieves all the images (at least 20), I'd like to get only one, so due it's about a <ul>, I was thinking about a way to display only the first <li> and ul li{ 	display:none;} for the rest. Any idea much appreciated. Cheers
[04:47:31] <Heather_> question why is :not(selector) working if the you define the event and selector inside on() and not when you do not e.g $(selector:not(selector)).event();
[04:59:51] <sacho> example?
[05:01:07] <Already> Does .next only return the next visible sibling?
[05:01:50] <Bauer> sacho, can you help me on figuring out how to utilize autocomplete widget in jquery UI?
[05:01:58] <Bauer> for email autocompletion
[05:02:44] <sacho> Already, it won't really care about visibility
[05:03:45] <Already> Hmmm Ok in taht case my problems is something different. Thanks. :)
[05:04:18] <Bauer> I want to make autocomplete widget, which would only trigger on the second part of email, so a person writes: foo@ - then autocomplete starts working, the moment he types "b" as in: foo@b - and only then autocomplete would offer foo@bar.com
[05:04:22] <Already> I'm trying to check whenever or not an element following another element is visible.
[05:04:46] <Bauer> all examples show classic autocomplete, not like waiting until user writes name@b, to start offering anything with b in it
[05:05:23] <Already> And fixed ... sometimes having your code in the right order helps. >_<

[07:42:06] <matteu> siovene: Consult the documentation on .stopPropagation, http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:42:40] <siovene> matteu: thank you.

[08:17:05] <star_prone> how can I attach an event to an element I add on the page after the page was completely loaded?
[08:18:59] <rmurphey> star_prone: are you the one adding the element?
[08:19:44] <rmurphey> because if so you can just ... bind the event using .on() after you add the element
[08:19:49] <rmurphey> ?on @ star_prone
[08:19:50] <bot-t> star_prone, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:20:09] <rmurphey> you may also want to look into event delegation, which is explained on the page as well
[08:31:05] <jeremy-> I'm playing around with jquery and i noticed a tutorial on integrating jquery-ui 'tabs'. I've done that successfully by just following the instructions. My question is on finding a way to make it so the tab content (a datatable), only loads when the tab is clicked.

[08:34:28] <jq_noob> it fails if I try to call them on the original JS object, but works if I look it up with $('#id'). two questions wrt that
[08:35:05] <jq_noob> 1) so $(#) returns something that is not an original JS object? some jQ wrapper I guess?
[08:35:37] <jq_noob> and 2) is there any better way to 'wrap' that JS element in jQuery, other than looking it up by name/id?

[09:05:20] <lord4163> Hello
[09:06:15] <lord4163> I'm not really experienced with jQuery but what I try to do is: I have a form and if I select a certain option it has to hide a field.
[09:06:50] <lord4163> It doesn't seem to work with my code: http://pastie.org/5432212
[09:09:21] <lord4163> Anyone can help me?
[09:09:37] <shoky> panaggio: told ya yesterday, it's not a CORS issue
[09:10:04] <shoky> panaggio: if it was a CORS issue, the POST would not have been sent at all
[09:10:52] <panaggio> shoky: so why I get an empty response only when on different domains?
[09:11:06] <panaggio> the same code works perfectly on same domain
[09:11:45] <shoky> panaggio: something in your server, i have no idea
[09:17:44] <lord4163> anyone?
[09:18:35] <shoky> lord4163: click events for <option>s don't work good. use the 'change' event on the <select>
[09:20:02] <lord4163> still doesn't work :(
[09:21:56] <shoky> lord4163: why  input[value='naam']  ?
[09:22:16] <aqeel> hi room
[09:22:27] <lord4163> idk but it neither works with #id
[09:22:42] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/L3q7S/
[09:23:05] <aqeel> so far very good works perfect....i would like to know if any more optimization can be made

[09:24:50] <lord4163> You are awesome thanks!
[09:26:04] <shoky> lord4163: [value='naam']  means only inputs whose current text is "naam"
[09:28:26] <lord4163> Okay thanks!
[09:38:24] <lord4163> shoky I get this error when I put it in my own code Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[09:41:02] <aqeel> got disconnected...
[09:41:07] <aqeel> any one saw my code
[09:42:47] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/avbkt/
[09:42:54] <aqeel> any comment
[09:43:04] <aqeel> can i have it more optimized???
[09:43:13] <lord4163> ah now it works
[09:43:31] <aqeel> can all the gurus join head and have their say
[09:44:18] <systemfault> aqeel: I'm no guru or anything but try caching your nodes.
[09:44:31] <systemfault> Any node selection in the DOM is slow.
[09:44:57] <aqeel> example please...
[09:45:03] <systemfault>                 if ($("#"+menu+"menu").hasClass("preview")){
[09:45:03] <systemfault>                     $("#"+menu+"menu").addClass("hoverstate");
[09:45:16] <systemfault> See how you select the element twice?
[09:45:46] <systemfault> var someMenu = $("#"+menu+"menu"); then use the somMenu variable after
[09:46:36] <aqeel> i would like so i can can chain var?
[09:47:11] <systemfault> ?
[09:47:45] <aqeel> var someMenu = $("#"+menu+"menu"); ----------------->if (someMenu .hasClass("preview")){ someMenu .addClass("hoverstate");
[09:47:54] <systemfault> Sure
[09:48:42] <systemfault> You can cache jQuery elements too…
[09:48:52] <aqeel> ok..thanks one step more for optimization.....any more requiorements that can be applied
[09:48:59] <systemfault> This part is exceptionally bad
[09:49:02] <systemfault> if($(this).hasClass("loaded")){preview("sub");$("#submenucontent").removeClass("loaded");}
[09:49:02] <systemfault>                         if($(this).hasClass("notloaded")){locked("sub");$("#submenucontent").addClass("loaded");}},
[09:49:35] <systemfault> var element = $(this); // Caches the $(this)
[09:50:03] <systemfault> I haven't seen the html but having both a 'loaded' and a 'notloaded' class looks weird to me
[09:50:22] <roumada> hi, i would appreciate some advice on triggering a custom event. I typed $(window).trigger('scrollstop'); and that gave me the error: Object [object Object] has no method 'apply'
[09:51:16] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com.....................click details.........................follow on with toying menu and sub menu
[09:51:48] <systemfault> roumada: Seems to work on that small test http://jsfiddle.net/WHhfr/
[09:52:27] <systemfault> aqeel: I get that weird prompt to use another browser…
[09:52:42] <systemfault> aqeel: I use the latest chrome… so it's a bit pointless
[09:52:52] <aqeel> well at moment  chrome and opera are under construction
[09:53:04] <aqeel> have some bugs..
[09:53:08] <systemfault> But chrome is the most widely used browser on the internet..
[09:53:11] <aqeel> will clear later
[09:53:11] <systemfault> Ok :/
[09:55:51] <aqeel>  I haven't seen the html but having both a 'loaded' and a 'notloaded' class looks weird to me..............no it does not have both but either one and based on that the if gets choosen
[09:56:25] <aqeel> its like 2 states for toggle...
[09:56:50] <systemfault> aqeel: With a single class… you already have two states.
[09:57:07] <systemfault> The element either has a loaded class.. or not
[09:57:08] <aqeel> toggle on, mouse enter and mouse leave....toggle off, mouse enter and mouse leave
[09:57:17] <aqeel> yes two but not four
[10:10:24] <aqeel> systemfault:   var MM =$("#"+menu+"menu");                                     MM.removeClass("hoverstate");           and  this one to          $("#"+menu+"menucontentstatus").removeClass("green");---------------------->MM+("contentstatus").removeClass("green");
[10:11:07] <systemfault> aqeel: That won't work
[10:11:41] <aqeel> so i need something to have it concatenated with string and var
[10:13:01] <aqeel> (MM+"contentstatus").removeClass("green");
[10:13:07] <aqeel> how bout this?
[10:15:05] <systemfault> aqeel: You cannot "add" a string to a jQuery object.
[10:15:34] <aqeel> so there is no way at all??
[10:15:59] <aqeel> i was trying to common out all posibilities and use what is possible to reduce common code
[10:24:53] <aqeel> sys
[10:25:03] <aqeel> systemfault: this seems not to work
[10:25:31] <aqeel>  var M=$("#"+menu+"menu");.................................function menuhover(menu){         M.on({
[10:28:30] <aqeel> seems i cannot make it global var
[10:28:40] <aqeel> within the function it works
[10:29:00] <aqeel> i have to do it in every function
[10:29:31] <aqeel> but why can't i make it global
[10:29:51] <tw2113> variable scope issues?
[10:30:36] <aqeel> how cn i make a universal scopr for multi functions
[10:31:11] <aqeel> var outside fn, then use in fn1(),fn2(),fn3()
[10:34:38] <aqeel> ok thanks.......room got to go and will be back after optimization
[11:05:17] <motox> I have 15 select boxes within a div that I need to add an onchange listener to.  I remember reading a while ago that there was a "best practices" methodology that could be used for doing this instead of creating an individual listener for each element.  Can someone refresh my memory what that would be?
[11:08:01] <systemfault> The second form of .on but I'm not totally sure it works with the change event
[11:08:20] <rmurphey> motox: it's called event delegation
[11:08:46] <motox> rmurphey: Thats it!  Thanks!  For the life of me I couldnt remember what it was called to read up on it
[11:09:32] <rmurphey> http://jsfiddle.net/hTLar/

[11:31:11] <veQue> how do i or is it even possible to setAttribute in JQuery ? http://jsfiddle.net/znQxq/3/ i want dataX in AA to change from 1 to 12
[11:31:42] <veQue> i checked the API and of course no setAttribute exists
[11:31:48] <veQue> is there  a way?
[11:31:49] <Haprog> attr()
[11:31:58] <veQue> i thought that gets... not sets
[11:32:05] <Haprog> both
[11:32:10] <veQue> oh wow
[11:32:13] <veQue> ok thanks
[11:32:23] <Haprog> and you should use "data-*" instead of "data*"
[11:32:42] <veQue> ok use hyphens for convention?
[11:32:51] <Haprog> no use a dash after data
[11:33:05] <veQue> oh i see.
[11:33:18] <Haprog> because in HTML5 the data-* is the "namespace" for custom attributes
[11:33:55] <veQue> awesome it works!
[11:33:59] <Haprog> you could also use jQuerys data() instead to get and set values, but that differs a bit from attr() read the docs.
[11:34:23] <veQue> is there an advantage?
[11:34:32] <veQue> or disadvantage the way i'm using now?
[11:35:03] <Haprog> I'm not sure. I think data() might be faster or better cached, because it doesn't actually edit the data attributes in the DOM (though it is first populated from the DOM)
[11:35:45] <veQue> ok i'll write that down in my notes if i need it thanks

[12:02:52] <thinkerweb> well, I know ask etiquette
[12:03:09] <thinkerweb> but I had a favour, can you visit www.thriftywebs.info and tell me what you see
[12:03:46] <nightfly_> I see "Under Construction"
[12:04:14] <rmurphey> ditto
[12:04:17] <thinkerweb> nightfly_, thx, and black background, with yellow helmet?
[12:04:18] <nightfly_> And an obnoxious "is hosted on the cloud with..." line
[12:05:03] <nightfly_> Well, nearly black background.
[12:05:23] <thinkerweb> I set my nameserver to hostzilla on my domain registrar, but I am not getting the dns working but its working for nightfly_
[12:07:45] <nightfly_> Try using Google's public DNS servers if want to see DNS changes a bit quicker: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/

[12:10:50] <thinkerweb> nightfly_, I must use hostzilla nameservers since I am using there free hosting
[12:11:11] <thinkerweb> nightfly_, their free hosting I mean
[12:11:30] <nightfly_> For resolution on your machine, not for your site
[12:11:50] <thinkerweb> nightfly_, I think my dns is taken care of by my isp
[12:15:19] <nightfly_> Yeah, and the changes will propogate eventually. In my experience changes have propogated to Google's a bit quicker though. Like how I could see your change before you could.
[12:16:04] <urbann> nightfly_: I tried that earlier without success but now it works! thanks a lot

[12:17:50] <thinkerweb> nightfly_, How do I change to google nameservers, I am using debian

[12:23:06] <gear4> $('#serverinfo').html('<h1>test</h1>'); <= why doesn't that work ?
[12:23:12] <gear4> I have <div id="serverinfo"></div>
[12:23:17] <gear4> and no errors came out
[12:23:27] <rmurphey> veQue: your code has syntax errors, but generally, you'd want to make your selection, store it in a var, and then test and change the attr on the selection accordingly
[12:23:41] <rmurphey> ?demo @ gear4
[12:23:44] <bot-t> gear4, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:24:22] <rmurphey> gear4: you should veryify that $('#serverinfo') is getting any elements by logging it to your console

[12:26:36] <veQue> Kataki: ty also. big help
[12:33:09] <motox> rmurphey> You still online by chance?
[12:35:21] <motox> In this example:  http://jsfiddle.net/hTLar/   How would I get the actual text of the selected option instead of the value?  I am wanting to use the this property instead of grabbing it by the element ID
[12:36:41] <shoky> motox: $(this).find('option:selected').text()
[12:37:09] <motox> shoky> Thanks
[12:39:56] <motox> shoky> I dont suppose the value is passed with 'this' at all is it, such as this.id or this.value?  In the onchange, it executes an ajax call, so technically the user could change the box again before the call is returned and that would change the value.
[12:42:05] <shoky> motox: the option's text isn't generally available as a property of the <select> element, no
[12:47:42] <adamsilver> do you recommend i use jquery to open a new window or straight js?
[12:48:05] <shoky> jquery won't help you open a new window
[12:48:20] <raj> hey shoky :)
[12:48:24] <shoky> yo rajy
[13:26:32] <relipse2> i have 2 columns
[13:26:35] <relipse2> column 1 and column 2
[13:26:40] <Salt> so I'm trying to add a lightbox on all swf links, the lightbox is working fine, however the swf won't load. I've tried swfobject and .load with no avail, any ideas? a test server is available if someone would like to take a look
[13:26:49] <relipse2> defined under .Col1 and .Col2
[13:27:03] <relipse2> how do I add a tabindex to iterate every other item
[13:28:24] <relipse2> how do i get all input texts inside a particular element?
[13:34:58] <Salt> ah, I see, it is an issue of cross domain policy
[13:39:03] <tw2113> oh cross domain
[13:44:44] <philipp_> Is this the place to ask about keydown events in JQuery?
[13:46:20] <tw2113> my 8ball says yes
[13:47:07] <philipp_> I basically want to use the left arrow like shift+tab and the right arrow like tab. I came up with the following code (taken from stackoverflow, but not quite working):
[13:47:23] <philipp_> function UseKeys(e) {
[13:47:25] <philipp_>   var nodes = $('.focusable'), idx = -1;
[13:47:26] <Salt> tw2113, I am just trying to embed it, some sort of iframe would even work, it's basically instead of popping up a new window popping up a lightbox, any idea what path I should venture down?
[13:47:26] <philipp_>   if (e.keyCode == 39 | e.keyCode == 68) {
[13:47:28] <philipp_>     nodes.get(++idx).focus();
[13:47:29] <philipp_>   }
[13:47:31] <philipp_>   if (e.keyCode == 37 | e.keyCode == 65) {
[13:47:32] <philipp_>     nodes.get(--idx).focus();
[13:47:34] <philipp_>   }
[13:47:35] <philipp_> }
[13:47:39] <karisma> philipp_: can you use pastebin?
[13:47:44] <philipp_> ok, sorry.
[13:48:18] <karisma> or jsfiddle
[13:54:43] <philipp_> Here is a version that almost works; the focus is shifted, but only when .next can see the inputs. When they are separated by paragraphs, it doesnt: http://jsfiddle.net/dMJvv/78/
[13:55:16] <Salt> tw2113, har, I listened to myself and just insert an iframe, works :P
[13:56:32] <philipp_> So my question really is: how can I select the next input, even when it is not a sibling?
[13:57:07] <tw2113> see what happens when you listen to yourself?
[13:57:16] <tw2113> you hear voices and somtimes get solutions
[13:58:36] <philipp_> I tried that for the last 2 hours ;)
[14:37:19] <bembelimen> hi
[14:39:30] <bembelimen> the last few days i played a little bit with forms (html5 validation), jquery validation and ajax submit
[14:40:07] <bembelimen> amongst other things i tested this jquery form plugin: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[14:40:36] <bembelimen> there exists only a "full version" of the script (means not minified)
[14:40:44] <bembelimen> so i tried to minify it
[14:40:58] <bembelimen> (it works in the "normal" version)
[14:41:13] <bembelimen> but now i get "TypeError: (intermediate value)(...) is not a function"
[14:41:26] <bembelimen> (so far for the background talk)
[14:41:53] <bembelimen> so my question is: how can i "see" if a script is "minifiyable" (dies this word exists?)?
[14:42:29] <bembelimen> or are there any known resources where i can read more about "guidelines"?
[14:43:04] <bembelimen> perhaps i can fix the error and create a patch
[14:43:47] <rmurphey> bembelimen: what tool are you using to minify it?
[14:44:07] <rmurphey> all scripts should be minifiable to some extent
[14:44:17] <rmurphey> stripping whitespace, renaming variables, etc
[14:44:46] <bembelimen> first i tried jscompress.com, then refresh-sf.com/yui and at least minifyjavascript.com
[14:45:06] <bembelimen> always the same error (for me)
[14:46:31] <bembelimen> i'm not interested in "fixing" the error (ok i guess i am, but thats not the important point), i'm more interested in understanding, why it breaks or how i can "see" if something breaks
[14:46:46] <bembelimen> before i minify
[14:47:01] <rmurphey> well, except in fairly weird cases, you shouldn't see stuff break when minifying
[14:47:21] <rmurphey> i've only every run into it with haml.js, which does some truly weird and unorthodox stuff
[14:47:42] <veQue> hi i have silly fall through error i think.. 1 supposed to changed to 2.. or 2 to 3..... not 1to2to 3.. what am i doing wrong?
[14:47:49] <rmurphey> do you have a demo page where we can see it, bembelimen ?
[14:47:52] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/cLZ5T/
[14:49:36] <bembelimen> mhh, i think i "fixed" it...
[14:49:50] <bembelimen> the minifier removes the ";" at the beginning and at the end
[14:51:19] <rmurphey> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/KDcUv/ is much easier to read
[14:52:48] <rmurphey> veQue: and with that version, i think it should either do 1 -> 2 or 2 -> 3
[14:53:06] <veQue> rmurphey:
[14:53:24] <veQue> yeh i guess its something wrong with the code elsewhere
[14:53:39] <rmurphey> veQue: you could also do http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/KDcUv/1/
[14:54:36] <veQue> k i'm gonna geive that a shot
[14:54:46] <relipse2> hey guys check out my new registration page!! nice eh? http://cworklog.com/register.php
[14:56:13] <rmurphey> veQue: or even http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/KDcUv/3/
[14:56:27] <rmurphey> take advantage of the fact that when you use attr as a setter, you can provide a function
[14:56:37] <bembelimen> ok, thanks for the help, the problem was, that there was a missing ";"
[14:56:39] <rmurphey> and that function receives the old value as its second argument
[14:59:57] <veQue> rmurphey: if i have two or more events could it be running twice? .bind(' keyup change',function()
[15:00:02] <veQue> i wouldnt think so
[15:00:08] <veQue> but just making sure
[15:09:24] <klj613> i got a object which has several objects. how i find out how many objects is in the main object?
[15:15:08] <shoky> klj613: count them in a loop. e.g.:  var num=0, k; for (k in obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(k)) num++ }
[15:15:27] <klj613> thanks.
[15:15:47] <coldhead> that will count all properties, not just objects
[15:17:42] <klj613> it just something quick anyway. rather than counting it myself :)

[16:21:54] <wookiehangover> var $ = "jQuery";
[16:21:58] <tw2113> lols you tried to loop over a string!
[16:22:22] <coldhead> var "$" = function(jQUery) ?
[16:22:26] <zduffy> Haha thanks coldhead
[16:23:33] <coldhead> and i'm in love with the hook on which everyone hangs
[16:24:12] <gabrieluk> if i want to make an app with backbone.js, should i use Jquery UI?
[16:24:42] <coldhead> you should if you need UI components, yes!
[16:25:11] <gabrieluk> ok! i need a lot of ui
[16:25:25] <coldhead> backbone is tres agnostic, honey badger doesn't care etc
[16:26:35] <gabrieluk> coldhead, would you have a link or a tut showing a backbone example working with jquery ui components so i could have an idea? so far all i got is tuts with node.js teaching the rest side of it.
[16:26:40] <tw2113> coldhead, rmurphey do either of you use Alfred and have some custom searches?
[16:26:57] <tw2113> trying to gather some good webdev based custom searches
[16:27:17] <coldhead> gabrieluk: how about this first google result http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/02/20/using-jquery-plugins-and-ui-controls-with-backbone/
[16:33:37] <rmurphey> tw2113: i use alfred but don't do anything special with it
[16:34:47] <gabrieluk> thanks, i think i went there, coldhead, but that guy talks a lot about kendo ui, so i thought it wasn't really good source of info
[16:35:24] <gabrieluk> i just asked here because i can't find something the way i want at google. i mostly do a lot of queries before asking here
[16:35:28] <coldhead> i have never used UI and backbone myself, i'm not sure what pitfalls to watch for
[16:35:35] <coldhead> i just know backbone won't care
[16:35:42] <coldhead> it'll stay out of your way
[16:35:57] <coldhead> yes of course, gabrieluk, i wasn't chastising
[16:36:08] <coldhead> you are a Querant of Quality
[16:36:08] <gabrieluk> :D, ok
[16:37:59] <tw2113> drat, thanks anyway rmurphey
[16:38:00] <tw2113> :)
[16:40:21] <gabrieluk> coldhead, what i'm really wondering is about ajax calls. I know that jquery ui, let's say autocomplete, does ajax calls to retrieve data. But i also know that backbone have it's own way to do ajax. so what I'm wondering is what will prevail to execute ajax
[16:41:00] <gabrieluk> its*
[16:41:22] <gabrieluk> not sure if i make sense
[16:41:57] <gabrieluk> i guess i need to get my hands dirty
[16:42:15] <coldhead> backbone does its own thing ajaxwise for loading/saving collections to the server
[16:42:32] <coldhead> but it shouldn't interfere with any other ajax you need
[16:42:40] <coldhead> backbone is way more minimalist than that
[16:43:14] <coldhead> you really only want to use it for global state/hash routing/MVC stuff
[16:43:22] <coldhead> everything else is still your problem
[16:43:24] <gabrieluk> ahhh, i understand, so the jquery jax calls actually won't change, they  will just be inside the view, right?
[16:43:37] <coldhead> right!
[16:43:48] <gabrieluk> nice
[16:44:58] <coldhead> gabrieluk: this is the most i've done with backbone https://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin/blob/master/app/conversational-latin.js
[16:45:14] <coldhead> you'll see i'm using some ajax there (actually JSONP)
[16:45:24] <coldhead> but it's indepedent of the backbone stuff
[16:45:49] <gabrieluk> hey, nice! you are into it :)
[16:46:21] <coldhead> that was a long time ago :P
[16:46:30] <tw2113> in a far away galaxy?
[16:46:44] <coldhead> it feels like it
[16:46:52] <coldhead> but where are my frequent flyer miles
[16:49:06] <tw2113> you only get those if you present on jQuery
[16:49:12] <tw2113> with it being your first day, you don't get to
[16:49:16] <tw2113> we want knowledgeable people
[16:49:28] <coldhead> i understand
[16:49:54] <tw2113> rmurphey is a prime example
[16:50:03] <tw2113> she knows, and presents on, thus she gets FFM
[16:50:50] <tw2113> apparently code smells too
[16:52:03] <coldhead> mr murphey smells wonderful, how dare you
[16:59:25] <rmurphey> tw2113: coldhead is probably remembering the sunscreen i was wearing, not me
[17:00:23] <tw2113> coldhead, don't make smelly code?i can link you to a fronteers presentation by mr murphy if you need me to

[18:40:28] <hlve> stupid question, but is there any way to target all elements that have display:none, and .remove(); them?
[18:43:24] <vladikoff> hlve, http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[18:51:17] <sent-hil> when I $(e).val() I get the value i dynamically set, how when i get $(e), "value" is still 0 (default)
[18:52:01] <shoky> sent-hil: what do you mean, "value" is still 0?
[18:52:30] <sent-hil> shoky: maybe i'm misunderstanding the relationship between .val() and the actual "value" field in the element
[18:52:48] <shoky> sent-hil: what kind of element are you talking about?
[18:53:01] <sent-hil> shoky: <input>
[18:53:14] <shoky> usually .val() corresponds to the value property of the DOM node
[18:55:38] <sent-hil> shoky: if i dynamically update it with .val("10"), then wouldn't the "value" property be changed to 10 as well
[18:56:08] <shoky> yes
[18:56:16] <sent-hil> shoky: however in this case "value" is still 0, but if I do .val() I get the dynamically updated value
[18:56:34] <shoky> you might be looking at the value _attribute_ on the html element
[18:56:42] <shoky> which doesn't neccessarily change dynamically
[18:57:03] <shoky> which is why i asked at first: what do you mean, "value" is still 0?
[18:57:06] <shoky> you just said it again.
[18:57:28] <sent-hil> shoky: i guess my question is how do I update that as well?
[18:57:36] <shoky> why do you want to update that?
[18:58:00] <shoky> it's the property that matters
[18:59:20] <shoky> you can update attribute with .attr(..) tho
[18:59:24] <shoky> attributes*
[18:59:55] <sent-hil> shoky: i'm using the jquery ui slider plugin to let users select values for various settings, and store that in value, later on i take that value and make an ajax request
[19:00:13] <shoky> just use .val()
[19:00:17] <shoky> for reading and writing
[19:03:17] <sent-hil> shoky: will do, thx!
[20:05:11] <alwayslearning> can anyone tell me what kind of age gate http://www.dogfish.com/ is using? It seems like it could be done with jquery

[20:16:42] <coldhead> not something i know much about i'm sorry
[20:17:01] <coldhead> if i were going to borrow it i'd comment the code and rewrite it less crappily
[20:28:15] <coldhead> and it is not a question of locking or unlocking

[20:30:35] <tw2113> oh no, coldhead is left with me

[20:38:36] <raj> I'm having an issue with a drag-selector plugin by ThreeDubMedia. I've got a conversation with EvilTwin that would be more telling. The links in the chat are also valid so you can see the live site--> http://paste.ofcode.org/7xEsGDjV5CEd8XKKXvUDLY
[20:42:16] <treeprogram> Hi, how would I add a class to elements of a particular class upon a button click, but for only 1 second (e.g. addClass(".example"), then one second later removeClass(".example"))?
[20:42:51] <d8bhatta> Hi, please suggest  good vertical carousel
[20:48:47] <abjorn> I suggest making one
[20:48:49] <abjorn> :)
[20:52:08] <coldhead> good chat abjorn
[21:03:03] <zsoc> Slightly odd problem. I'm using .replace to remove characters.. such as .replace("$", ""); .. but when i try to replace an html character, like .replace("&pound;", ""); .. just doesnt work.. so i have to escape some of those chars or something?
[21:05:00] <zsoc> it works with %C2%A3 but then the jquery works but it displays as %C2%A3 on the page lol
[21:07:05] <zsoc> \u00A3 works too but same display issue with html
[21:07:10] <zsoc> guess i'm just using the charitself...
[21:28:05] <veQue> do i need the $
[21:28:21] <veQue> seems to be optional
[21:28:25] <runvnc> lol
[21:28:31] <runvnc> what are you talking about dude
[21:28:43] <veQue> var myInputC = $("input:text[name='CC']");
[21:28:45] <runvnc> yeah you need it
[21:28:56] <veQue> var dataA = ("input:text[name='AA']").attr('data-x');
[21:29:01] <veQue> what about here?
[21:29:07] <runvnc> you need it
[21:29:12] <runvnc> what makes you think its optionals
[21:29:14] <runvnc> optional
[21:29:19] <runvnc> its a regular identifier
[21:29:23] <runvnc> that is a function call
[21:29:37] <veQue> so var dataA = $("input:text[name='AA']").attr('data-x'); ?
[21:29:39] <runvnc> sometimes you will see things like jQuery('#theid').attr(.. whatever
[21:29:56] <runvnc> right well
[21:30:07] <runvnc> I dont know if that is going to do what you want it to do, but the $ is not optional
[21:30:11] <veQue> but i dont need to go var $daraA right?
[21:30:14] <runvnc> maybe what is messing with your head is
[21:30:20] <runvnc> wait for a second
[21:30:23] <runvnc> like I just said
[21:30:27] <runvnc> its a regular function call
[21:30:31] <runvnc> pretend instead of $
[21:30:39] <runvnc> it says jQuery('#theide')
[21:30:43] <runvnc> id I mean
[21:30:45] <runvnc> ok
[21:30:50] <veQue> oh
[21:30:54] <veQue> ok thanks
[21:31:11] <runvnc> it just so happens that in javascript you can use a special character like dollar sign as an identifier name
[21:31:29] <runvnc> maybe the other thing that might be confusing is that you can chain calls in jquery
[21:31:52] <runvnc> because stuff like attr and everything return jquery objects
[21:32:04] <runvnc> so you will only see one $
[21:32:09] <nightfly_> Chaining calls is one of my favorite features <3
[21:33:21] <runvnc> yup chaining is great
[21:37:56] <coldhead> nooooo bot-t
[21:53:17] <treeprogram> how do you removeClass with a fade effect
[21:53:17] <treeprogram> ?
[21:54:34] <nightfly_> Like fade transition between the state of the elment with the class and without the class?
[21:54:42] <Z^3R0> remove css class with face effect ?
[21:54:59] <Z^3R0> it is not related with attributes, it's just transition of the element
[21:55:01] <coldhead> ?animateclass
[21:55:02] <bot-t> coldhead, UI/Effects/ClassTransitions - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI effects core extends the base class API to be able to animate between two different classes. The following methods are changed. They now accept three additional parameters: speed , ea... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions
[21:55:11] <runvnc> http://jqueryui.com/addClass/
[21:55:58] <treeprogram> nightfly yes exactly
[22:00:19] <treeprogram> ok got it thanks
[22:03:18] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[22:20:08] <grek1> hi, how to disable loading content to colorbox ?  - example $('someHref').colorbox({onOpen:function(){ return false() } - not work
[23:23:19] <MagePsycho> can you guys recommend good overlay plugin for jquery?
[23:44:37] <veQue> yay i finally got my code working
[23:45:56] <puppen> veQue++
[23:46:08] <puppen> (aww, no beer here?)
[23:47:12] <veQue> showed someone...non-coder family memebr.. boy did i feel like an idiot
[23:47:13] <veQue> lol
[23:47:18] <veQue> it's hard to explain the hell i wentt hrough for 4 little boxes on the screen
[23:47:35] <veQue> but it's the logic behind them that took me all day to figure out
[23:47:40] <veQue> lol
[23:47:51] <veQue> missing colon here or there
[23:47:57] <puppen> veQue: The non-techies never seem to understand what we go thru
[23:48:02] <puppen> "Oh wow, that's... Nice"
[23:48:04] <puppen> :/
[23:48:06] <veQue> lol
[23:48:15] <veQue> yeh thanks man
[23:48:26] <veQue> =)
[23:48:45] <tw2113> don't look down on the non-techies
[23:48:49] <tw2113> they're potential clients
[23:48:52] <veQue> lol
[23:49:00] <veQue> yeh i suppose
[23:49:17] <tw2113> if they understood it all, why would they need you?
[23:49:23] <puppen> I don't look down on them, I love them...
[23:49:35] <puppen> But sometimes their reactions put a damper on your effort
[23:49:44] <veQue> it's just an empty feeling explaining why it took you over a week to do something that looks like so unpsectacular
[23:50:05] <tw2113> it's a trap
[23:50:10] <tw2113> that the clients tend to use too
[23:50:11] <veQue> they live and breathe the web, and take it for granted
[23:50:19] <tw2113> "it'd be simple, you just have to do this and this"
[23:50:31] <tw2113> then you look at it and go "this will take me a week of research, trial, and error"
[23:50:40] <veQue> yes!
[23:50:46] <veQue> that's exactly the thought
[23:50:55] <tw2113> the thing they are unimpressed by is the same that they'd request thinking it'd be simple
[23:51:01] <tw2113> welcome to our world
[23:51:11] <veQue> you know how many tutorials and webpages i went through?
[23:51:47] <veQue> example after example
[23:52:24] <veQue> i even got an "f you" from private messaging someone. i apologized but wow
[23:52:43] <veQue> didnt expect the big f
[23:52:58] <veQue> but it was my fault
[23:53:15] <veQue> so now i can sit back and relax a bit
[23:53:30] <veQue> and laugh like a maniac on the inside
[23:53:38] <veQue> the good kinda laugh
[23:53:46] <puppen> I laugh like a maniac on the outside...
[23:53:51] <puppen> ;)
[23:54:39] <tw2113> you people have inner monologues?
[23:55:09] <veQue> yes
[23:55:16] <veQue> i'm typing and not talking
[23:55:26] <veQue> that's as inner as it gets
[23:56:35] * veQue hugs code
[23:56:44] <veQue> thank you for working
[23:57:02] <runvnc> no.. more inner is when I stand around in bathroom, looking in the mirror while I whisper half of a dialogue to myself  (barely audibly so my roomie doesn't hear)
