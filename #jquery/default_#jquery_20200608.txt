[01:03:56] <Bluerate>  hello all, try to get current location as https://jsbin.com/yumimaqali/edit?html,js,output but I got error code 1 and error code 2 ... how to get success message?
[01:09:45] <Hoppelhase> 1. This is not a jQuery question; 2. You already asked that on another channel and got an answer there
[06:26:53] <errorous> Hello. I've  form with some text input elems. I use .each to go through all and attach an onclick event to some buttons. Now, the problem is that after a certain 3rd party event, said form is deleted from dom, and another one, with same html structure(ie classes and elem hierarchy) is created
[06:27:13] <errorous> with that said, my events that were bound to previous form, the one deleted from dom, are no longer there
[06:27:24] <errorous> I know I need to use even delegation, but how would I do that?
[06:39:32] <errorous>  /join #javascript
[06:48:37] <Cork> errorous: add a delegated event handler to a static parent instead of the attribute on the elements
[07:01:39] <errorous> Cork: is .on a delegation by default?\
[07:01:54] <Cork> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[07:01:57] <Cork> no
[07:08:36] <errorous> Cork the thing that's troubling me is foreach
[07:08:53] <Cork> errorous: you don't do that
[07:09:04] <errorous> Cork: https://hastebin.com/owexubibem.js
[07:09:06] <Cork> just catch the bubbling events
[07:09:08] <errorous> current script
[07:10:22] <Cork> errorous: do you have more button.plus, button.minus buttons in the form?
[07:10:46] <errorous> Cork I have one plus one minus for each element in the .each
[07:10:59] <Cork> ok, and?
[07:11:06] <Cork> you want the event for all of them?
[07:11:24] <errorous> Cork yes, for each one of them, hence the .each
[07:11:41] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'form.woocommerce-cart-form button.plus, form.woocommerce-cart-form button.plus', functiion() {})
[07:11:46] <Cork> should do that just fine then
[07:12:20] <Cork> you don't use anything from the each anyway
[07:20:08] <errorous> cork thanks a ton!
[08:18:10] <robertparkerx> I have an .each function for each li element and from that split the id attribute. These li are added dynamically but I get 'undefined' for some reason
[08:32:00] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry that wasn't it
[09:09:13] <robertparkerx> how could I put quotes around filter.id
[09:24:35] <robertparkerx> I got it
[09:24:40] <robertparkerx> I just changed to String()
