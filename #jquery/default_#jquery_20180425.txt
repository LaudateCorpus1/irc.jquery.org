[08:24:13] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[08:24:27] <silv3r_m00n> is there a way to make this sortable widget mobile responsible https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default  ?
[08:35:12] <preference> silv3r_m00n: have you tested it currently?
[08:35:26] <silv3r_m00n> preference: yes, its not working on my moto g
[08:35:32] <silv3r_m00n> is it supposed to be mobile compatible ?
[08:36:26] <preference> silv3r_m00n: http://jquerymobile.com/
[08:36:45] <preference> silv3r_m00n: http://forresst.github.io/2012/06/22/Make-a-list-jQuery-Mobile-sortable-by-drag-and-drop/
[08:36:55] <preference> (may be outdated, but it's a start)
[08:37:27] <preference> there are also many links to http://touchpunch.furf.com/ silv3r_m00n
[08:41:03] <silv3r_m00n> by the way, is this jquery mobile dead ?
[08:41:13] <silv3r_m00n> what is this page saying, https://blog.jqueryui.com/2017/12/the-future-of-jquery-ui-and-jquery-mobile/ ?
[08:41:52] <preference> they're just saying they're not going to be using IRC for development anymore
[08:41:54] <preference> they'll be using slack
[08:42:06] <preference> they're also combining jquery UI and jquery mobile into one project
[08:42:14] <preference> (for exactly the reason that you're in here now)
[08:42:20] <preference> so don't worry about it
[08:43:36] <silv3r_m00n> and how do i go about using jqueryui and mobile together ? and is jquery ui supposed to be used on mobile at all ? now i am confused. the devices are ipad, smartphones and desktops
[08:43:39] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: i remember a touch plugin for jquery ui not sure if it is still around
[08:44:00] <silv3r_m00n> people here are saying https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9139316/mixing-jquery-mobile-jquery-ui  they "made it work" which means there is no proper way of doing it
[08:44:05] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[08:44:12] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: yeah, checking that now
[08:44:57] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: i've used touch punch my self in projects before; haven't used all widgets but it works quite well
[08:45:14] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: some widgets aren't even close to optimized for mobile and that is part of what they mean
[08:45:19] <Cork> (dialog for example)
[08:45:20] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: so what is the correct way of doing it cross device ? jqueryui + touchpunch ?
[08:45:35] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: depends on what you need
[08:45:48] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: you might want to have a different ui layout for mobile
[08:45:52] <silv3r_m00n> its a backend admin kind of app which needs dialogs, datepickers and sortables
[08:46:02] <silv3r_m00n> i am targeting a single user interface optimized for all devices
[08:46:05] <Cork> but ya jquery ui touch punch might work well depending on what widgets you use
[08:46:07] <silv3r_m00n> i mean same ui layout
[08:46:23] <silv3r_m00n> let me check what bootstrap has to offer
[08:46:33] <Cork> personally i used it for slider and it works well there
[08:47:00] <Cork> (i rarely use anything but slider and autocomplete from jquery ui)
[08:47:17] <Cork> in production use that is
[09:39:24] <Stutters> Hi guys. Is it possible to make a $.post/$.ajax behave like a form does when submitted? A form redirects the client to the page in the "action" attribute. Ajax obviously does not do that. Can I somehow mimic this though? Or do I really need to have the <form>...</form> structure somewhere so I can trigger it?
[09:51:29] <Dunams> I'm trying to update a value in a select element in an adjacent table cell
[09:51:32] <Dunams> $(this).closest("td").find("select").html(data);
[09:51:57] <Dunams> this is being triggered on 'change' event on a select element in the first cell
[09:52:18] <Dunams> what's wrong here? the element is not being updated with the data
[09:54:35] <Stutters> Dumans: Try going step by step. Does `$(this).closest("td")` return the expected result? If so, go on to the next chained command and recheck
[09:55:06] <Stutters> Maybe you forgot some `[0]` there
[09:55:36] <Stutters> It's really hard to tell without having the code here :)
[09:55:55] <Dunams> w.fn.init [prevObject: w.fn.init(1)]
[09:56:01] <Stutters> Dunams: Sorry, mispelled your nick^^
[09:56:14] <Dunams> I guess it's because $(this) inside a $.get scope is not what I expected it to be
[09:57:37] <Dunams> where can I paste the code into? pastebin is being filtered here -.-
[09:59:38] <preference> jsfiddle.net
[10:04:29] <Dunams> https://jsfiddle.net/3w8k3awn/
[10:05:08] <preference> Stutters: ^ if you want
[10:10:41] <Stutters> preference: If I want? Sorry, what? :)
[10:11:14] <Dunams> Stutters, he meant if you want to look at my code I suppose :)
[10:11:34] <Dunams> https://jsfiddle.net/3w8k3awn/
[10:20:04] <Stutters> Dunams: I've been looking at your code. Where do you want your data to appear?
[10:24:17] <Stutters> Oh well xD
[10:28:41] <Cork> ugg crazy week... >_>
[10:29:37] <Stutters> Cork: For me too...
[10:31:10] <preference> ++
[10:31:13] <Cork> i think i beat you this time... they are ripping apart my bathroom (down to the slat i think it is called)
[10:31:22] <Cork> working in that is... @_@
[10:32:06] <preference> why are you working in your bathroom?
[10:32:23] <Cork> no, but i am working in my apartment, and well the bathroom is in it :)
[10:41:13] <Dunams> Stutters, sorry I got disconnected
[10:41:19] <Dunams> in the 2nd td select box
[10:41:23] <Dunams> oncalls[]
[10:41:40] <Dunams> of the same row where the change event occurred
[10:56:36] <alexises> Hello, I have a usecase that is a bit complicate
[10:57:27] <preference> alexises: is this pure jquery?
[10:57:59] <alexises> preference: I try to determinate if I have a jquery or jquery-ui module for my case ;)
[10:58:16] <alexises> if not, I will continue my usecase
[10:58:23] <alexises> *elsewere
[10:58:42] <alexises> I would like on a select have main entity and chield entity
[10:58:51] <preference> jsfiddle.net if it's very complex would be easier
[10:59:26] <alexises> ;)
[11:08:45] <alexises> for instance I have this
[11:08:47] <alexises> https://jsfiddle.net/f9w0cqp3/
[11:09:36] <alexises> I have a hierarchical form
[11:10:46] <alexises> I would like to not be able to select the site-one and site-two option, in addition when the form is posted I would like that the post var will be cut.
[11:11:18] <alexises> the first part before # passed as "site" attribute and the other part passed as "iface" attribute
[11:11:40] <preference> just make the option you want disabled
[11:11:59] <preference> that's literally just some HTML after the class name, type disabled
[11:12:08] <preference> as for the rest, that's beyond me. sorry
[11:14:16] <Stutters> Hey preference, you here for a while?^^
[16:01:06] <catbadger> heyo
[16:01:12] <catbadger> I have a nightmare to share:
[16:01:44] <catbadger> upgrading jquery to 1.3.3 and jquery-ui to 1.12.1... autocomplete throws errors in the way I'm trying to use it.
[16:02:16] <catbadger> so i want to dynamically update the source attribute
[16:04:25] <catbadger> it does not work like that. it seems as thought the source attribute can only be set on instantiation?
[16:04:30] <catbadger> anyone?
[16:09:15] <catbadger> sigh
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> sorry,m just got back.
[16:15:02] <robertmaxrees> oh he left.
[16:15:39] <taplar> yeah i was fixing to dig in the api, but the office is fairly busy
[16:18:45] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:19:02] <taplar> incase you read the logs catbadger, I would think you should be able to use the setter version of http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-option to give it the new source values
[16:30:04] <toothfairy_> Hi, is there any simple way to animate this margin change with a sliding effect? document.getElementById("main-container").slider.style.marginLeft = "80px";
[16:30:32] <toothfairy_> pls ignore the (.slider) part
[16:30:35] <taplar> there is the animate method
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> if you use jquery
[16:30:59] <toothfairy_> taplar: was looking at it but could not find any example on how to implement it correctly
[16:32:05] <taplar> essentially you just give it an object with the css key value pairs relating to what is changing
[16:32:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:32:13] <taplar> jquery will do the animation from where it is at to where it should be
[16:32:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:32:27] <robertmaxrees> there are some examples in the docs of animating various properties.
[16:32:47] <toothfairy_> taplar: like document.getElementById("main-container").style.marginLeft.animate() = "80px"; ?
[16:32:58] <taplar> no like robert said, it's a jquery method
[16:33:02] <robertmaxrees> toothfairy_ you can't use document.getElementById for this./
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> you have to use $()
[16:34:14] <toothfairy_> robertmaxrees: oki, tnx, will try to figure it out
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> toothfairy_ there's also learn.jquery.com
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> and try.jquery.com
[16:34:33] <robertmaxrees> for examples and getting your head around the basics.
[16:43:16] <toothfairy_> $("#main-container").animate({ marginLeft: '80px' }, 1000); did it
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:34:00] <xyz111> how does .data() work under the hood? I believe it somehow assigns unique IDs per DOM node, but how does it know if it has got the same element twice?
[18:34:27] <xyz111> any explanations greatly appreciated :)
[18:35:17] <xyz111> also, how does it know to delete data when a node is removed from the DOM?
[18:36:06] <xyz111> i.e. would you have to use remove() in order to prevent a memory leak? or does it somehow monitor the nodes and remove associated data when the node is removed
[18:36:08] <xyz111> ?
