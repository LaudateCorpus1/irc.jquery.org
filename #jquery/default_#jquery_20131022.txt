[00:08:33] <lite_> could someone explain to me why the following works flawlessly(as in the listener is triggered on every 'scroll' ) on desktop, but never fires on mobile? $window.on('scroll', handler);
[00:08:40] <lite_> $window is a jquery element
[00:10:16] <Cork> lite_: that should work just fine on mobiles
[00:10:44] <lite_> Cork: so the only explanation is that im setting the listener on the wrong element ?
[00:10:55] <Cork> possibly ya
[00:11:00] <Cork> or something is blocking the event
[00:12:15] <lite_> hmm
[00:12:17] <lite_> hammer.js ?
[00:12:26] <lite_> actually
[00:12:34] <lite_> looking at the timeline the scroll event does fire
[00:13:14] <lite_> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11917448/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-22%20at%209.12.54%20AM.png
[00:15:07] <Cork> lite_: try http://fiddle.jshell.net/EvLUV/show/
[00:15:43] <Cork> my phone is out of juice at the moment >_<
[00:16:18] <lite_> actually. http://binarymuse.github.io/ngInfiniteScroll/demo_basic.html
[00:16:22] <lite_> works fine on my phone
[00:16:30] <lite_> so obviously its not the library
[00:16:33] <lite_> and im doing something wrong
[00:18:39] <Cork> and ya the demo i gave you works for me
[00:18:52] <Cork> so... sounds like you have something killing your events for you
[00:21:07] <lite_> Cork: you think hammer.js could do that ?
[00:21:28] <Cork> lite_: any event listener for scroll with return false; could do it
[00:21:39] <Cork> or rather would do it
[00:22:23] <Cork> lite_: though... that would break it on desktop too
[00:22:32] <lite_> right
[00:22:35] <Cork> you might have a touchstart event listener doing something
[00:24:15] <lite_> yea i most definently have that
[00:25:05] <lite_> or actually. i have on.'hold' and on 'swipeleft' (both hammer js)
[00:25:36] <lite_> (and 'drag')
[00:34:51] <socek> is there a possibility, that .html(htmlString) will return an error?
[00:38:12] <jphase> not if htmlString is a string it shouldn't
[00:38:26] <socek> jphase: thx
[00:38:32] <jphase> yup
[01:30:14] <mkoks> hello, can anyone help me with youtube js api issue? My 'playerVars' property does not work, I have no idea why
[01:44:34] <dopie> Hey all
[01:46:45] <mink> Hi guys. I've saved json in data attribute in jQuery. I can easly get $("foo").data('json') and I get json response. Problem is when I want to override parameter which is inside json, like data('json.object.foo')
[01:46:53] <mink> I dont know how get it and override
[01:47:13] <Cork> $("foo").data('json').object.foo
[01:48:09] <Cork> data('json.object.foo') would actually create a key 'json.object.foo'
[01:48:10] <mink> lol Cork
[01:48:19] <mink> I cant believe
[01:48:22] <mink> Thanks a lot :)
[01:48:26] <Cork> np
[01:52:43] <seutje> heh, weird... using an old jQuery 1.4.2 and it's giving a weird "Failed" error when calling $(':radio')
[01:53:01] <seutje> and like, the error gets thrown in jQuery sauce, not on the line calling it
[01:53:17] <seutje> (on IE8)
[01:53:37] <Cork> so $('input[type="radio"]') :)
[01:54:19] <seutje> yeah, was gonna try that as a workaround
[01:54:25] <seutje> but there has to be an underlying issue
[01:54:39] <seutje> (this is a ginormous project that evolved into quite the nasty monster)
[01:56:14] <seutje> same with :checkbox apparently
[01:56:54] <gumble> can someone tell me why this one here: http://pastebin.com/Z9w3u3r7 gives me unexpected identifier syntaxerror on line 5 but not on line 1 though they are the exact same identifier?
[01:56:59] <Cork> i never use those callback filters my self
[01:57:09] <Cork> so can't say i've seen the error before
[01:57:40] <Cork> gumble: >'key +
[01:58:10] <gumble> damnit!!
[01:58:15] <gumble> thanks Cork
[02:00:59] <mink> seutje, It work with newest version of jQuery?
[02:01:26] <seutje> mink: not in a position to swap jquery versions
[02:01:40] <seutje> using attribute selectors fixed the errors
[02:01:55] <mink> seutje, so just swap this one filter, not jQuery version
[02:03:21] <seutje> well, I have to fix a styling issue, was hoping this error was causing it, but it isn't :(
[02:03:33] * seutje shakes fist in angry manner at people who use CSS3PIE
[02:04:22] <gumble> and can someone tell me why I am here getting: <ul></ul><li></li><li></li>.... instead of <ul><li>...</ul>? http://pastebin.com/vu1E3AEZ
[02:06:02] <mink> gumble, you append ul to #modal_product
[02:06:19] <mink> and after that you append li in the end of #modal_products
[02:06:26] <mink> Oh wait
[02:06:38] <mink> Why do you do something like that
[02:06:39] <Cork> gumble: you can't append html like that
[02:06:46] <Cork> gumble: append parses the string to dom
[02:06:50] <Cork> and dom don't have close tags
[02:07:00] <Cork> crate an ul element, append the li's
[02:07:11] <Cork> and then append the ul to the modal_products
[02:07:24] <Cork> also, don't have tag selectors infront of id's
[02:07:29] <Cork> that will kill performance
[02:07:34] <gumble> so by append('ul') the whole child is created or what?
[02:07:53] <Cork> gumble: .append('<ul>') creates an ul yes
[02:08:03] <Cork> the tag is closed through error correction
[02:08:12] <gumble> ok then I missunderstood append
[02:08:15] <gumble> thanks thanks
[02:08:28] <Cork> gumble: jquery works with dom, you never build html with it
[02:08:32] <gumble> is append('<ul></ul>') a good way to create my child ul?
[02:08:56] <Cork> var ul = $('<ul>'); ul.append((); ... $().append(ul)
[02:09:02] <mink> gumble, try do sth like that
[02:09:06] <mink> http://pastebin.com/KYxP7WRn
[02:09:20] <mls_> hi all, anyone using http://mailru.github.io/FileAPI/ ? Can't get the flash zone to be at the right place (and it should be automatic I bet...)
[02:09:57] <mls_> I've got my <file> tags on the left, and the flash is on the right, when it should be on top of the files inputs
[02:10:58] <gumble> thanks both I think i'll use the first approach
[02:11:02] <gumble> seems easier to me
[02:11:45] <mink> gumble, we do exactly the same but with different sytax
[02:11:50] <gumble> is var product_list = jQuery('<ul id="product_list_in_modal">'); also fine?
[02:12:06] <gumble> mink: yap I mean the first syntax is easier to understand for me
[02:12:17] <mink> gumble $("<ul></ul>", { id: product_list_in_modal  }); is better for browser
[02:12:25] <gumble> ok thanks!
[02:28:04] <mink> gumble, dont be afraid about syntax like that, just try understand and you will be faster next itme
[02:28:06] <mink> *time
[02:29:14] <seutje> oh man, I love IE8
[02:29:27] <seutje> z-index: 9998; no workie, 9999, workie!
[02:29:36] <aquatix> magic numbers \o/
[02:29:39] <seutje> highest other z-index on the page is 10
[02:29:46] <seutje> 10 + 1 = 9999, right?
[02:30:04] <aquatix> obviously
[02:30:26] <ha1331_> seutje: did you try 11?
[02:31:10] <seutje> tried 11, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 9000, 9998 and 9999
[02:31:17] <seutje> sry, 1 as well
[02:31:25] <seutje> I blame CSS3PIE
[02:31:40] <seutje> damned hidden VML crap
[02:32:11] <ha1331_> seutje: Balmer must be handling that one him self. Mini Balmer taking care of business.
[02:33:11] <seutje> ha1331_: sorry, that made no sense to me
[02:33:52] <Cork> seutje: z-indexes works weird in old ie's
[02:34:05] <seutje> yeah, especially the relative part
[02:34:20] <Cork> they doesn't they don't follow the normal parent rules for stacking
[02:34:32] <seutje> still, makes no sense why 9998 didn't work and 9999 did
[02:34:41] <seutje> actually 9998 showed my <ul> wrapper
[02:34:48] <aquatix> as i said, i think 9999 is a special case
[02:34:52] <seutje> changing it to 9999 on the UL showed its children
[02:35:13] <aquatix> wouldn't surprise me if they hardcoded it in their engine or something
[02:54:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> With the jqueryui datepicker, is it possible to use a ISO date to set the picker, but in the textbox displayed a localized version?
[02:55:36] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: just pass the date through Date() and have it localized
[02:56:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but will the datepicker know what to select by default then?
[02:56:25] <Cork> date can generate a string that matches what datepicker expects
[02:58:46] <seutje> is magic
[02:59:00] <Cork> js> print(new Date('2013-10-22T10:00:00Z').toLocaleString())
[02:59:08] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[02:59:11] <Cork> <_<
[02:59:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If i put that in the textbox, the datepicker will understand it?
[02:59:23] <Cork> js> print((new Date('2013-10-22T10:00:00Z')).toLocaleString())
[02:59:28] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[03:00:18] <Cork> hmm
[03:00:37] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: anyway that will generate a date string in local format
[03:00:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes I know
[03:00:53] <Cork> as long as it is valid for the date picker it will work
[03:01:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but if I put that in the textbox, the datepicker will not recognize it because it's some foreign language
[03:01:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it just converts it to the format defined in dateFormat
[03:01:56] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-formats
[03:02:05] <Cork> is that what you're looking for?
[03:02:12] <Hopsy> how can I know the user visit my website again by pressing the history back button? I want to know the user comes back by using the history back button.
[03:02:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I've read the whole docs twice already, I can't fix this problem
[03:03:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This is put in the textbox: vrijdag 11 oktober 2013 7:02:50 if I localize it, which is good
[03:03:12] <Cork> Hopsy: if the page haven't been unloaded by the browser, some browsers trigger pageShow events
[03:03:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but then when I click the textbox, it should stay and update in this format, even when you change date
[03:03:22] <Cork> Hopsy: but that is about it
[03:06:19] <Hopsy> Cork:  pageshow events hmm can you define that? maybe show me an example

[03:11:48] <rootshift> hi guys, I'm just wondering how I would achieve a random animation on this jquery plugin? http://buildinternet.com/project/mosaic/
[03:11:50] <synju> guys anyone here use DataTables?
[03:12:04] <rootshift> currently it is on fade, but I want random animations as I have a few images to display
[03:26:15] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:26:29] <jomofcw> Is there anyone who use history.js with jQuery here, please ?
[03:26:53] <Cork> ?ask
[03:26:53] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:27:13] <synju> anyone know datatables for jquery?
[03:27:21] <Cork> ...
[03:27:46] <Cork> synju: read the line directly before yours
[03:33:18] <jomofcw> Cork xD... yea right so : I can't load this **** (but probably amazing) script ! I just do a SCRIPT TAG with the src "script/js/history/html4+html5/jquery.history.js" as explained in the readme and... it doesn't load the History object :/...
[03:33:37] <jomofcw> [the script in the src is well finded]
[03:34:37] <Cork> have you checked so the script is actually loaded
[03:34:43] <Cork> (and without errors)
[03:37:04] <jomofcw> Cork yup, it is !
[03:37:13] <jomofcw> Well loaded.
[03:39:01] <Cork> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/nR74M/
[03:40:03] <jomofcw> Hm wrong... it isn't well loaded in fact :/.
[03:40:57] <jomofcw> History exist but is an "empty" prototype... when I reload the script with a jQueyr.getScript the do a console.log again i've got a full object :/...
[03:41:12] <jphase> any regex guru want to help match all thing after the '.com' in a url?
[03:41:20] <Cork> ...
[03:41:36] <jphase> woops, wrong window
[03:41:37] <Cork> why can't ppl ever learn how to ask questions....
[03:42:33] <jomofcw> Cork yea it's an old problem ;).
[03:42:52] <Cork> ya i know, but it is still annoying
[03:42:53] <jomofcw> So anyway, it should be my minify system that mess up the thing...
[03:43:06] <jomofcw> Cork sure it is :/...
[03:44:51] <msafi> I'm reading a book on jQuery and have come across the toggle() function which seems to do two different things: toggle functions when element is clicked, or toggle visibility of element. How does jQuery know which one you intend to use?
[03:45:22] <Cork> msafi: it depends on how many arguments you send to the function
[03:45:48] <Cork> msafi: though the function toggle part has been deprecated for quite some time
[03:45:51] <Cork> and was removed in 1.9
[03:46:19] <msafi> Cork, oh wow, what a bad mistake then in the book I'm reading.
[03:46:34] <Cork> msafi: the book is prob just old
[03:46:38] <msafi> Cork, it's 2013 publication
[03:46:49] <msafi> has 4.5 stars and 70+ ratings on Amazon
[03:46:50] <Cork> well 1.9 was released in 2012
[03:47:01] <Cork> late 2012
[03:47:13] <msafi> But it's probably been deprecated for a long time.
[03:47:17] <Cork> sure
[03:47:20] <aquatix> msafi: might be that it's a revision in which the author oversaw that change
[03:47:23] <Cork> ?api toggle
[03:47:23] <b-ot> Cork: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[03:47:50] <Cork> msafi: version deprecated: 1.8, removed: 1.9
[03:48:06] <Cork> so it was deprecated in 2011
[03:49:04] <msafi> Cork, I see. Thanks a lot!
[03:49:12] <krambiorix> is there some selector that states  "id like myid% " ?
[03:49:21] <Cork> no
[03:49:46] <Cork> cause you should never select partials on id's
[03:49:49] <Cork> use classes if you want that
[03:50:10] <Cork> class="every part you want to be able to match separately"
[03:50:20] <Cork> $('.every.able.separately')
[03:50:36] <_rgn> don't think he meant that
[03:50:57] <slax0r> no he didn't
[03:51:10] <krambiorix> no, I didn't
[03:51:12] <slax0r> but the way he wants to select multiple items with similar ids is just wrong
[03:51:16] <Cork> what he stated was find a string that starts with myid
[03:51:39] <krambiorix> i want to find an id that starts with myid
[03:51:44] <Cork> exactly
[03:51:53] <Cork> and the way i explained is how you should do it instead
[03:52:02] <slax0r> give all those elements with ids that start with myid a special class, and select by that class
[03:52:15] <Cork> ex. class="myid nr2005" or something
[03:52:43] <Cork> an id is only effective if you use it to find one element
[03:52:54] <Cork> as soon as you want to use it to find a group you arn't using an id
[03:53:15] <Cork> (you're using an attribute)
[03:55:17] <krambiorix> ok then: how can i find a class that starts with "mycl"  ?
[03:55:29] <Cork> again your doing it wrong
[03:55:35] <Cork> split the class up instaed
[03:55:51] <Cork> mycl-something-other should just be mycl something other
[03:56:00] <Cork> then you can just select on .mycl or .mycl.other
[03:56:07] <krambiorix> Cork, ok but my classes are account numbers and i want to find all classes with a number
[03:56:41] <Cork> krambiorix: only way to do what you won't is to drop down to looping all elements and checking if there is an attribute on the element with the matching string
[03:57:04] <Cork> you can't use the browsers hash tables for id or classes if you do it that way
[03:57:17] <krambiorix> hhmmm
[03:57:20] <krambiorix> ok then
[03:57:22] <krambiorix> thanks all!
[03:57:39] <Cork> $('[class*="mycl"]')
[03:58:19] <Cork> though that is close to the same as $('*').filter(function() { this.class.match(/^mycl/); });
[03:58:28] <Cork> as it will actually loop every element in the page
[03:59:23] <jomofcw> Cork just inc ase it could help further : minify don't like the "+" character that history.js include in its directory name ^^. That was the wrong point =). Thanks for your help.
[03:59:42] <Cork> lol
[03:59:50] <Cork> jomofcw: interesting...
[04:00:39] <jomofcw> Yup, dunno why this "+" mess it up :/.
[04:04:24] <gumble> is there an expr ? true : false; thing for javascript or jquery?
[04:04:38] <gumble> what is the name of syntax like that?
[04:04:51] <Cork> gumble: yes
[04:04:54] <Cork> exactly like that
[04:05:01] <gumble> ok thanks
[04:05:10] <gumble> do you know how that is called?
[04:05:24] <slax0r> this is shorthand if, in case you'll be searching it in the future
[04:05:38] <Cork> conditional operator
[04:05:43] <Cork> ?mdn conditional operator
[04:05:44] <b-ot> Cork: Conditional Operator - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[04:05:54] <gumble> thanks!
[04:06:27] <slax0r> ah...in php it's shorthand if :P
[04:06:32] <slax0r> thought it was the same in js
[04:06:47] <gumble> and is there a better shorthand for: var boolean = textinput ? true : false;    textinput is either 'on' or undefined
[04:06:52] <Cork> ?g php conditional operator
[04:06:52] <b-ot> Cork: PHP: Comparison Operators - Manual → http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php
[04:06:55] <gumble> undefined -> false, 'on' -> true
[04:07:05] <Cork> slax0r: :P
[04:07:29] <gumble> ah oh i know
[04:07:38] <gumble> textinputt !== undefined
[04:07:49] <Cork> slax0r: well it's called ternary in php
[04:07:57] <slax0r> your point? comparison operators are only ==,===,!==,!=, and so on :P
[04:08:18] <Cork> slax0r: http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary
[04:08:57] <slax0r> and ternary operator is the ? and : :P
[04:09:01] <Cork> yes
[04:09:11] <slax0r> the whole if statement is usually called shorthand if
[04:09:17] <frank_o> Any reasons to use jQuery 1.10.2 over jQuery 2.0.3 other than IE?
[04:09:34] <Cork> slax0r: what if statement are you talking about?
[04:09:50] <Cork> if(): ?
[04:10:01] <slax0r> (condition) ? true : false
[04:10:03] <Cork> frank_o: no
[04:10:16] <frank_o> Cork: Sweet :)
[04:10:25] <frank_o> It's upgrade time baby!
[04:11:10] <Cork> frank_o: the only difference between 2.x and 1.x is that 1.x has ie support
[04:11:24] <iben> hi! anyone has an idea how to combine jquery-ui options and methods? ex. $("selector").sortable("toArray", {cancel: ".new"}) does not work
[04:11:26] <Cork> so for the moment there is little reasons to use 2.x
[04:11:27] <slax0r> 2.x dropped all ie support?
[04:11:30] <Cork> no
[04:11:34] <Cork> ie < 9
[04:11:38] <slax0r> ah
[04:11:57] <Cork> mainly cause they removed attachEvent
[04:12:07] <Cork> (in 2.0)
[04:12:47] <Cork> iben: you normally can't
[04:13:00] <Cork> iben: you need to create the widget before you can call functions on it
[04:13:14] <Cork> $("selector").sortable({cancel: ".new"}).sortable("toArray")
[04:13:49] <iben> Cork: wow, thanks, I get it now!
[04:14:03] <frank_o> Guys if I may. Why does this nav menu stop columnizing its dropdowns after I bind it to pageinit (as recommended by jQuery Mobile)? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/5/ (uncomment the first line please)
[04:19:34] <krambiorix> how can i reload a dom element?
[04:20:08] <seutje> krambiorix: reload as in trigger a repaint?
[04:20:47] <sahbeewah> frank_o, what do you mean by columnizing its dropdowns?
[04:20:49] <krambiorix> seutje, yes mylady
[04:20:55] <seutje> xcuse me?
[04:21:01] <krambiorix> seutje, yes
[04:21:07] <seutje> http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html
[04:21:32] <seutje> messing with one of those props should trigger a repaint
[04:22:51] <frank_o> sahbeewah: Well those columns in the dropdowns are made from JS
[04:23:41] <gumble> if I define a var form_values inside a jquery form-submit handler, is there any reason why my js console keeps telling me form_values is not defined, after I submitted the form and it did execute the submit handler (i have console.log at the end of the submit handler to check if it is called)
[04:23:45] <krambiorix> seutje, , i loop through one div's elements and put them in another div, but i think the loop goes too fast and takes all inner divs multiple times
[04:24:23] <sahbeewah> frank_o, it works fine if you wrap it with pageinit, make sure you close your brackets properly
[04:25:40] <frank_o> sahbeewah: When I uncomment line 1 and comment line 2 at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/5/, when hovering Test and Test 2 (on the latest version of Chrome), I'm no longer seeing any columns.
[04:25:42] <sahbeewah> gumble, because you didn't define it?
[04:25:52] <shwaiil> Q: I've got an element that is visible when the parent is :hover, such like <ul><li>Menu<ul><li>visible on parent hover</li></ul></li></ul>. On the iPad, this only happens when clicking the parent, but then the submenu persists visible. What should I trigger to avoid or reset this state ? Thanks!
[04:27:17] <gumble> sahbeewah:  if I define a var form_values is my way of just passing by the information that I did define it in my question
[04:28:16] <gumble> even console.log(form_values) works
[04:28:21] <gumble> just not calling it from the console
[04:29:12] <vajaraska> hello guys, I experience issues using fancybox 'closed' event
[04:29:21] <vajaraska> It simply does not work
[04:29:36] <sahbeewah> frank_o, sorry unsure
[04:29:58] <frank_o> Cool
[04:31:22] <Syrit> Guys, i am using bootstrap, and in my app there are a couple of .glypicons, now, i want to be able to select glyphicons-chevron only, not others, they are like ".glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"
[04:31:24] <vajaraska> my kode is here, can anyone please tell me what is wrong with it - http://pastebin.com/XuaVV4j8 ?
[04:31:26] <sahbeewah> gumble, so you're trying to get the value of form_values by typing it in the console?
[04:32:02] <vajaraska> beforeLoad is triggered but closed not
[04:32:48] <gumble> sahbeewah: yes, is that wrong?
[04:33:30] <gumble> can't I reference variables defined in my scripts in the console? that would explain it
[04:33:36] <gumble> somehow thought I could
[04:33:41] <sahbeewah> you can.
[04:33:56] <sahbeewah> but the console is context-aware. it will be in the context of wherever the debugger is set
[04:34:10] <sahbeewah> if it is not in one, you only have the global scope to work with
[04:34:41] <gumble> I am using chrome the build it js. it tells me I am in page-context
[04:35:03] <vajaraska> hey, really no one - http://pastebin.com/XuaVV4j8 ?
[04:35:05] <Cork> gumble: you need to break the js execution in the correct scope
[04:35:10] <gumble> *chromium browser, the build in js console
[04:35:15] <Cork> else you won't have access to that context
[04:35:28] <gumble> ah ok
[04:35:40] <gumble> thanks
[04:40:53] <seutje> krambiorix: got pastie?
[04:40:55] <sahbeewah> vajaraska, use afterClose/beforeClose instead?
[04:41:12] <DeafGoose> HI, how would I get 300x250 from the string "Regular Banner [300x250]" using jquery
[04:41:33] <sahbeewah> vajaraska, you can't just make up callbacks and hope they exist...
[04:41:58] <sahbeewah> DeafGoose, regex
[04:43:46] <DeafGoose> alright, I think that was a stupid question from me :-) found the answer thanks!
[04:43:48] <vajaraska> sahbeewah big thanks, now it works. I saw callback like that on stackoverflow
[04:44:24] <vajaraska> ..except that it was wrapped in quotes
[04:44:38] <Shadow> Hi, Can anyone help with this please. http://jsfiddle.net/6Tk8c/1/ When I hide tab1-1, the jquery is opening the wrong tab. Is there a way I can use tab1-4 in the jquery instead.
[04:44:38] <vajaraska> which I didnt understand
[04:46:50] <seutje> fiddle be sloooo
[04:48:50] <seutje> Shadow: no clue what ur trying to do, can't find a tab1-1 in that page
[04:51:33] <kpl> How to select a <div id="the_id" class="the_class" ... > to match both id and class?   I have: $("#mainelement div#the_id") but because several sibling divs in mainelement may have the same id I need to also select on the class to make sure I get the right div.
[04:52:10] <Shadow> seutje: When tab1-1 is in the page it all works fine. tab1-1 is only shown to the owner of the page. So if a visitor goes to the page tab1-1 is not shown. Thats where the problem is
[04:52:31] <kpl> Will just using $("#mainelement div#the_id.the_class") do?
[04:53:04] <seutje> Shadow: so the fiddle doesn't have tab1-1. so what is the problem there?
[04:53:20] <sahbeewah> kpl, the whole point of an id is that it identifies nodes; it must be unique
[04:53:32] <seutje> "but because several sibling divs in mainelement may have the same id" WAT?
[04:53:52] <seutje> jQuery will only return a single element when using an ID, just so u know
[04:54:07] <seutje> but yeah u can use $('#id.class') no need to add the element
[04:54:14] <Shadow> The jquery is opening the Contact Tab instead of the Map.
[04:54:22] <seutje> unless you really wanna make that a criteria, but know ur hurting performance a bit
[04:54:30] <sahbeewah> Shadow, why do you even pass a href if you're going to throw it away and hard-code the tab index to open?
[04:55:14] <seutje> Shadow: ooh, well that makes sense, ur just telling it to go to tab number x
[04:55:27] <seutje> if u drop shit from the front, u gotta adjust ur number
[04:55:48] <kpl> Yes, the ids should be unique. But do they technically HAVE TO be unique for jQ not to fail? Or is it just bad practice to have several elements with the same id?
[04:55:48] <Shadow> How call I tell it to go to tab1-4 instead
[04:55:51] <seutje> it doesn't know that "tab1-2" is actually not the first tab
[04:56:01] <seutje> Shadow: grab the index of it
[04:56:38] <sahbeewah> kpl, both
[04:57:14] <Shadow> seutje: thats what I can't figure out how to do.
[05:00:35] <kpl> But ids need only be unique among siblings? Or in the same document?
[05:00:54] <sahbeewah> document
[05:01:23] <seutje> Shadow: http://jsfiddle.net/6Tk8c/2/
[05:03:41] <kpl> So the "id" property is treated differently from other props set by e.g. .data()?
[05:04:21] <slax0r> ID is an ID, IDs are suppose to be unique
[05:04:41] <slax0r> .data has very little to do with IDs
[05:05:46] <seutje> Shadow: adjusted the other call as well http://jsfiddle.net/6Tk8c/3/
[05:05:54] <seutje> and removed the silly "javascript:"
[05:06:26] <sahbeewah> kpl, whenever you have a selector that ends in #selector, jquery will call the native document.getElementById method which will return 0 or 1 elements
[05:06:28] <seutje> kpl: jquery's data method doesn't usually interact directly with the DOM node
[05:06:34] <kpl> OK, thanks for comments. Reading docs on ID Selector("#id").
[05:07:00] <Cork> kpl: .attr/.prop is what sets normal attributes on an element
[05:07:16] <Cork> .data() is specially for just data you want to store in relation to an element
[05:08:00] <kpl> OK, so data was a bad example. Can I add a prop with any name?
[05:09:24] <sahbeewah> uh, what do you want to do with it?
[05:09:48] <koneko> kpl, probably won't do anything if you pass a property name that's not defined
[05:10:21] <kpl> OK, so if I wanted to store some data with undefined property name I should use "data"..
[05:11:57] <koneko> If you want to store any data you should use .data(). If you want to modify the element's properties you should use .prop().
[05:12:15] <koneko> And if you want to change its attributes, you should use .attr(), since there's a difference
[05:12:42] <koneko> Sorry - if you want to store any data _related to the element_, you should use .data()
[05:12:42] <Shadow> seutje: sorry for the delay in getting back to you. That works, but when tab1-1 gets added back in it then open Tab 'Offers & Sales'
[05:13:08] <gumble> isn't array('foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2) possible in js?? is there an alternative?
[05:14:32] <Cork> gumble: { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
[05:14:43] <Cork> it's an object, not an array
[05:14:51] <Cork> only php sees that as an array
[05:15:13] <Cork> (other languages sees it normally as a hash)
[05:15:44] <termnt> hey
[05:16:12] <gumble> Cork: ok thanks!
[05:17:23] <termnt> guys, im using 2 plugins, w2ui and bootstrap 3. displaying a w2ui grid seems to disable some of bootstraps functions/events, how can i solve this conflict?
[05:20:09] <seutje> Shadow: did u even try it? work fine for me -> http://jsfiddle.net/6Tk8c/4/
[05:21:35] <Hopsy> Cork: I cant find a solution
[05:21:42] <Hopsy> pff =[
[05:21:53] <Cork> Hopsy: sorry, what was the problem?
[05:21:57] <seutje> termnt: sounds like u just need to update ur w2ui: https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues/117
[05:21:57] <b-ot> seutje: Issue #117 by Lickity (5mon 3d ago): w2grid v1.2 conflict with Bootstrap Nav Dropdown
[05:22:00] <Hopsy> "[12:03:10] <Cork> Hopsy: if the page haven't been unloaded by the browser, some browsers trigger pageShow events"
[05:22:04] <seutje> termnt: also, not very jquery related
[05:22:10] <Cork> ah
[05:22:24] <Cork> Hopsy: did you try the pageShow event?
[05:22:52] <termnt> seutje: i thought about conflict between jquery plugins/usage in general..
[05:23:00] <Hopsy> I dont know how to use it
[05:23:07] <Hopsy> I tried things
[05:23:20] <Cork> $(window).on('pageshow', function() {})
[05:23:23] <seutje> termnt: sry, didn't realize w2ui was jquery plugin
[05:23:29] <seutje> termnt: also, sent u the wrong link: https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues/110
[05:23:30] <b-ot> seutje: Issue #110 by nabulsi (5mon 5d ago): Twitter bootstrap tabs & W2ui grid
[05:23:38] <Cork> hmm wait no it's target should be document
[05:23:45] <Cork> Hopsy: $(document).on('pageshow', function() {})
[05:24:06] <Shadow> seutje: sorry yes its working. Had only added backing the <li> line forgot the <div> line. Thank you for your help
[05:24:22] <Hopsy> so this means when the page loads it will run whatever is inside the function?
[05:24:38] <seutje> Shadow: btw, the -1 at the start is for excluding the <ul> containing the triggers
[05:25:42] <Cork> Hopsy: when the page loads from the history cache yes
[05:26:39] <termnt> seutje: thanks already saw that issue, but its not component related (i use w2ui grid and just when the grid is displayed an event handler on a completely different component does not work)
[05:26:44] <Hopsy> Cork: ah yes I see
[05:26:56] <Hopsy> and how do I the reverse of this?
[05:26:58] <termnt> if i do not display the grid everything works fine
[05:27:04] <Cork> reverse?
[05:27:08] <Cork> you can't
[05:27:16] <termnt> it seems like w2ui blocks events or disables eventhandlers somehow
[05:27:27] <Hopsy> ahh
[05:27:38] <seutje> termnt: oh, it's w2ui breaking bootstrap, not the other way around?
[05:27:55] <termnt> exactly
[05:27:59] <termnt> bootstrap is just working fine
[05:28:03] <termnt> without w2ui
[05:30:49] <Barbaren> hello
[05:31:51] <bberry> assume i have 2 arrays filled with objects.  all the objects in both arrays have a "name" property.  How should i go about comparing the names of one array to the names of another array?
[05:32:00] <Barbaren> i'm trying to overload the behaviour of a select element and managed to get a focus event to fire when it's clicked, however, how can i stop the default behaviour of the option elemens dropdown menu from appearing? preventDefault and stopPropagation doesn't do anything
[05:32:04] <bberry> should i extract the names of into 2 more arrays and compare those?
[05:32:04] <Barbaren> ...
[05:32:24] <Barbaren> bberry: what do you want to achieve?
[05:33:14] <bberry> Barbaren: I want to know what object names in array 1 arent contained in array 2's object names
[05:33:46] <Hopsy> Cork: it works, thanks!
[05:34:59] <Barbaren> bberry: use a nested for loop to search through the array and save whichever names match in a third array?
[05:35:13] <bberry> Barbaren: So say you have [{name:"billy"},{name:"joe"},{name:"thomas"}] for array 1, and [{name:"jimmy"}, {name:"joe"}, {name:"brent"}] for array 2, i want to return a separate array that gives me [{name:"jimmy"}, {name:"brent"}]
[05:35:41] <bberry> Barbaren: That is what i was planning on doing,. but i wasnt sure if there was a better way to do it
[05:36:04] <bberry> jquery often surprises me with APIs, so i thought id ask :P
[05:36:32] <shoky> bberry:  var a = [...], b = [...], bNames = b.map(function(obj){ return obj.name }), aFiltered = a.filter(function(obj) { return bNames.indexOf(obj.name) !== -1 })
[05:37:08] <Barbaren> you could use underscore.js and do _.difference(bNames, aNames) ...
[05:37:25] <Barbaren> http://underscorejs.org/#difference
[05:39:14] <shoky> or === -1  if you want the inverse
[05:43:46] <Barbaren> i'm trying to overload the behaviour of a select element and managed to get a focus event to fire when it's clicked, however, how can i stop the default behaviour of the option elemens dropdown menu from appearing? preventDefault and stopPropagation doesn't do anything
[05:45:55] <shoky> Barbaren: try preventDefault on the mousedown event
[05:46:29] <shoky> not sure if that works cross-browser though
[05:46:48] <shoky> usually if you want custom behaviour for dropdowns it's better to roll your own
[05:46:52] <bberry> shoky: Thanks. i like that solution :D
[05:50:01] <Barbaren> shoky: thanks, will try
[05:50:20] <Barbaren> shoky: yes but i want the default select behaviour in for example iOS broswer
[05:51:20] <shoky> you want SOME of the default behaviour ;p
[05:51:48] <shoky> and that's often hard to get with <select>s. but the mousedown thing might be fine
[05:53:59] <sahbeewah> for a moment there i was wondering why filter worked on a js array...
[05:54:31] <sahbeewah> but you should use $.grep for cross-compatibility... and for the sake of using jquery
[05:54:43] <shoky> meh!
[06:12:15] <miCSu> how can I detect the element the ui.draggable is dropped after?
[06:12:49] <miCSu> on droppable drop event $(ui.draggable).prev() gives the last child of the droppable element
[06:13:18] <miCSu> it's connected with sortable
[06:21:35] <newcoder> hola
[06:39:04] <Nomikos> I created a super-simple popup thinger. When you click the trigger, the popup zooms in from the left, growing in size until it displays in the center of the page.
[06:39:24] <Nomikos> Cool as that is, /I have no idea why this happens/. https://secure.mech.cx/var/tmp/zoom.php
[06:39:59] <Nomikos> Can someone explain? I hate mysteries :-/
[06:40:21] <Cork> what happens?
[06:40:44] <Nomikos> the zooming in from the left and growing - I didn't script that
[06:40:44] <Cork> or should i say what do you expect to happen?
[06:40:58] <Nomikos> I had expected it to just show up in the center
[06:42:11] <Cork> well you set left: -width/2
[06:42:13] <Nomikos> I'm creating the element, hiding it then appending it to get the dimensions
[06:42:35] <Cork> so it will move from ~ -104px left to center
[06:43:12] <Cork> if you don't want show to animate
[06:43:25] <Cork> just adding the click handle there instead
[06:43:40] <Cork> (remove the function callback from show)
[06:44:27] <Nomikos> if I remove the callback from show() it stops happening - but I don't understand why that causes it?
[06:44:45] <Cork> Nomikos: show takes a number or a string
[06:45:20] <Nomikos> .. ok, that's a point
[06:45:51] <Cork> Nomikos: when you give it a function it will fails to handle it and fall back to the default string
[06:45:58] <Cork> and it think that is 'slow'
[06:46:03] <Cork> (not sure there)
[06:46:20] <Cork> anyway
[06:46:22] <Cork> ?api show
[06:46:23] <b-ot> Cork: .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[06:46:23] <Nomikos> aah.. so it /is/ a jquery animation thing
[06:46:31] <Cork> yes
[06:46:46] <Cork> version two in that page
[06:47:01] <Cork> duration (default: 400) <--
[06:47:34] <Nomikos> that makes all sorts of sense
[06:47:37] <Cork> so .show(function() {}) is the same as .show(400, function() {})
[06:47:42] <Nomikos> thanks :-)
[06:47:45] <Cork> np
[06:52:53] <bberry> is there a Object.create(protoObject) for jquery?
[06:53:17] <bberry> or do i just make a jquery object and use it as the prototype for Object.create
[06:54:33] <moijk> Can i get the id of the element I shift off an array in jquery?
[06:55:06] <Cork> moijk: as long as you get a hold of the element; sure
[06:55:20] <Cork> bberry: just use Object.create
[06:55:30] <Cork> bberry: jquery isn't a language, it is a framework
[06:56:40] <bberry> Cork: okie doke.
[07:16:55] <meowsus> Hey everyone. I'm trying to get the best possible solution here, and maybe start a discussion about what might be best in this scenario. I'm trying to use jQuery to go out and grab an image from the server, then set it as a background image on an element. So far I've tried this method (http://pastie.org/pastes/8420447/text?key=3xyhc8pwr7ihgo7aj5gtow) to load an image tag, then when it's loaded show the source of the ima
[07:16:56] <meowsus> background on the other div. I've tried moving the $(this).remove() line all over the place, but it's still laggy. Ideally I want to grab the image, show a loading bar (which i can do), and replace the loading bar with the image once it's been fully retrieved and also store it somehow on page so that if it's accessed again, the transition is seamless.
[07:22:49] <lasha> var amountToScroll = $(hashTag).length != 0 ? $(hashTag).eq(0).offset().top - 186 : undefined;
[07:23:44] <lasha> this line of code fixes the "could not find property "top" of undefined", if the user's query string has a hash that doesn't match an element in the DOM.
[07:24:59] <Cork> or simply ($(hashTag).eq(0).offset() || { top: 0 }).top
[07:25:47] <Cork> actually .eq(0) isn't needed
[07:25:57] <Cork> so ($(hashTag).offset() || { top: 0 }).top - 186
[07:40:49] <lasha> oh, yea the .eq(0) is to target the 1st element returned
[07:41:02] <Cork> ?api offset
[07:41:02] <b-ot> Cork: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:41:08] <lasha> but i guess .offset() retrieves the value from only the 1st in the jquery collection......
[07:41:14] <Cork> ya
[07:41:17] <lasha> cool
[07:42:03] <lasha> i'm thinking of making a tutorial for how to create theverge.com's dropdown navigation
[07:43:10] <lasha> would that be something of interest for people?
[07:52:05] <jedimind> lasha if you do it with pure css
[08:06:32] <lasha> jedimind: wait, seriously?
[08:06:52] <lasha> why would that be more interesting than the more control JS/jQuery would give you?
[08:06:58] <jedimind> because its trivial
[08:07:05] <jedimind> can recreate that nav in like 5 minutes with jquery
[08:07:36] <jedimind> lasha
[08:07:48] <lasha> jedimind: 5 minutes?
[08:07:56] <lasha> 1 for 1 UX?
[08:08:00] <lasha> doubt 5 minutes
[08:08:04] <jedimind> youre talking about the dropdown ?
[08:08:06] <jedimind> the primary nav ?
[08:08:25] <jedimind> the jquery part would be 5 minutes
[08:08:28] <jedimind> the css another 10-15
[08:08:37] <lasha> ok i'll time you
[08:08:42] <lasha> 11:08AM EST
[08:08:43] <lasha> GO!
[08:08:50] <lasha> jsfiddle that shit
[08:08:51] <jedimind> i have a job
[08:09:10] <jedimind> anyway thats so complicated about it ?
[08:09:13] <jedimind> whats*
[08:09:24] <lasha> it's not that it's DIFFICULT, it's just more involved than you think
[08:09:35] <jedimind> am i missing something?
[08:09:45] <lasha> first, you have the delayed hover logic, similar to what the hoverIntent plugin does
[08:10:00] <jedimind> easily managed with keyframes w/ css
[08:10:02] <jedimind> go on
[08:11:23] <lasha> the nested markup of each of the sections
[08:12:00] <lasha> the slide down logic displaying instantly the section you hovered first
[08:12:15] <lasha> plus the CSS styling
[08:12:23] <jedimind> their nested markup is not so nested
[08:12:26] <jedimind> i would write it as a nested UL
[08:12:27] <lasha> that's at least 30-45 mins
[08:12:35] <jedimind> they have the divs for each dropdown individually segmented
[08:12:41] <lasha> well, for someone that actually knows their shit
[08:12:47] <lasha> another person would take hours
[08:13:23] <jedimind> totes
[08:13:27] <jedimind> im gonna write it in pure css tonight
[08:13:31] <jedimind> just for fun
[08:13:54] <lasha> how would you handle that stuff
[08:13:58] <jedimind> which ?
[08:14:00] <lasha> hovers
[08:14:10] <jedimind> the delay i would setup with css3 animation keyframes
[08:14:19] <jedimind> animated it for about 1 second, not starting to show it until about 50% of the way through
[08:14:23] <jedimind> which gives me about a 500ms delay
[08:14:41] <jedimind> in respect to the sideways action, :target state changes that initiate transformY keyframes again
[08:14:48] <jedimind> or :hover rather
[08:14:54] <jedimind> :target if we want to make it clickable
[08:15:22] <jedimind> i _might_ have to resort to javascript to just simply change classes on containers based on states, but i'll try to avoid that
[08:16:09] <jedimind> transformX rather not Y obviously
[08:16:27] <jedimind> lasha do you have a blog ?
[08:17:34] <lasha> yeppers
[08:17:57] <lasha> you wanna write a tutorial for me? :D
[08:19:53] <lasha> onefusedlife.com
[08:20:01] <lasha> about 4k uniques a month
[08:20:13] <lasha> decent exposure
[08:21:02] <lasha> also, i don't really get how you'd use css3 keyframe animation for this....
[08:25:20] <jedimind> lasha what do you mean? you start the animation of it coming down, but you dont actually move it down for about 500ms
[08:25:30] <jedimind> which means that if you hover over it quickly, the animation cancel itself and nothing shows
[08:25:42] <jedimind> and no, if anything id throw it up on my own blog :)
[08:29:09] <lasha> ah. link?
[08:29:20] <lasha> also, don't steal my idea. rebuild something else. lol
[08:31:39] <jedimind> haha lasha
[08:31:53] <jedimind> noone reads my blog anyway
[08:32:02] <jedimind> plus i probably wont write about it, but just do a fiddle
[08:32:03] <jedimind> for fun
[08:32:48] <rootshift> jedimind, i would read your blog if you posted stuff on it
[08:33:27] <jedimind> rootshift styledui.com
[08:33:33] <jedimind> i havent had time to write any real articles
[08:33:36] <jedimind> just catalogue shit if ind
[08:33:37] <rootshift> ima go read
[08:33:38] <jedimind> i find *
[08:34:09] <rootshift> better than mine jedimind… haha
[08:42:11] <jedimind> lasha still there ?
[08:42:38] <lasha> yes
[08:42:57] <jedimind> lasha http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/q72Gn/1/
[08:43:04] <jedimind> only the first item has a dropdown for the sake of the demo
[08:43:12] <jedimind> but thats how youd do the delay w/ the hover and pure css3
[08:44:07] <lasha> can you now delay on mouse out?
[08:44:30] <jedimind> i might need js just to toggle a class change
[08:44:40] <jedimind> but i might be able to do it without that as well
[08:44:57] <lasha> oh yea?
[08:45:09] <jedimind> i do need to get some actual work done though
[08:45:12] <jedimind> so im going to have to come back to it :)
[08:45:19] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning folks
[08:48:33] <patchie> can i use webdav to access files on a network drive from my greasemonkey script?
[08:49:49] <richcorbs> hi, is there a "right" way to re-create the "on('setData'…)" construct? I found some snippets on stackoverflow but cannot get them working with my code
[08:50:07] <MalMen> hello
[08:50:16] <MalMen> can anyone help me here in this selector
[08:50:16] <MalMen> $('#s_meses').find('option').not(':first').remove();
[08:50:32] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[08:50:33] <BillCriswell> MalMen: What's the issue?
[08:50:41] <MalMen> is not selecting anythibng
[08:50:56] <doug65536> MalMen: $('#s_meses').find('option').slice(1).remove()   <-- might work better
[08:50:57] <BillCriswell> MalMen: It's removing things.
[08:51:00] <MalMen> i want to remove all options from an select but stay with option 1
[08:51:04] <MalMen> hmm, let me test
[08:51:19] <MrPunkin> Does it make more sense, if I'm going to call a function that can change or be overridden, to trigger that via a custom event or to simply call the function in my code where it should run? Advantages / disadvantages to each?
[08:51:32] <MalMen> dummy me
[08:51:35] <MalMen> its working :d
[08:51:38] <MalMen> thanks :)
[08:51:59] <duch_kazatel> MrPunkin imo custom events are great until somebody else comes along to maintain your code.
[08:53:01] <doug65536> MrPunkin: I would suggest using events for things that really are events
[08:53:06] <MrPunkin> duch_kazatel: I was thinking I'd rather just try and call the function with a fallback on an empty function if it were overwritten null or something, the event system seems to just add cruft
[08:53:20] <richcorbs> is there a "right" or "best" way to watch for changes made to $('body').data('mystuff')? I'd rather not have to trigger the event each time I make a change to mystuff.
[08:53:22] <MrPunkin> doug65536: yeah, okay, thanks. Helps solidify the route I was already hoping to take
[08:54:16] <kevinold> How do I get the jQuery wrapping (like with first()) but for get()'s?  Use case is that I want same behavior of first() but for 5th element  https://gist.github.com/kevinold/7103181
[08:54:37] <doug65536> kevinold: eq ?
[08:54:50] <kevinold> doug65536: I havent' tried that
[08:54:52] <doug65536> kevinfagan: something.eq(4)
[08:54:53] <BillCriswell> kevinold: .eq(5)
[08:54:59] <BillCriswell> Ah, 0.
[08:55:14] <kevinold> BillCriswell: thanks trying now
[08:55:36] <BillCriswell> kevinold: .eq(4) would be for the 5th, forgot it was zero based.
[08:55:41] <doug65536> the 5th element is really good looking :D
[08:56:03] <jedimind> MULTIPASS
[08:56:20] <kevinold> BillCriswell: right, thanks.  you too doug65536!
[08:56:45] <doug65536> np
[08:57:52] <doug65536> kevinfagan: oops, wrong person. ignore what I said
[09:04:40] <tubiz> Is it possible to use an image for a file select something like this http://d.pr/i/aGIo
[09:06:48] <duch_kazatel> tubiz "for a file select" meaning?
[09:07:23] <lasha> yes
[09:07:34] <lasha> set the opacity of the file select element to 0
[09:07:39] <lasha> and position it OVER your image
[09:08:30] <tubiz> duch_kazatel once a user click on this image http://d.pr/i/aGIo I want a file select to open
[09:09:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah look at lasha's tips.
[09:09:41] <BillCriswell> lasha: Clever.
[09:10:19] <duch_kazatel> the only other thing I could come up with would be to use an event listener to then trigger .click() on the file upload button.
[09:10:24] <BillCriswell> Can you trigger a click on an input[type=file] progrmatically? That's the route I would have went until i heard the opacity one.
[09:10:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ha, same.
[09:10:32] <jbw> ugh
[09:10:52] <BillCriswell> jbw: Was that an unhappy "ugh"?
[09:10:55] <jbw> isn't there a variable in the chrome js console which points to the currently inspected element ? if so, what is it ?
[09:11:01] <lasha> i don't think that route works, programmatically triggering the click
[09:11:06] <BillCriswell> jbw: $$ I think.
[09:11:15] <duch_kazatel> the opacity one might have issues in some older browsers.
[09:11:32] <jbw> hrm
[09:12:01] <tubiz> duch_kazatel so which way can i go
[09:12:02] <BillCriswell> I think it's actually $... but jQuery may be taking that?
[09:12:22] <duch_kazatel> tubiz imo styling inputs is always a crapshoot.
[09:12:39] <jbw> it's definitely not $, $$ does point to a function but it's nothing to do with inspection as far as i can see :/ hrm
[09:12:41] <BillCriswell> jbw: My mistake $0
[09:12:47] <jbw> ah
[09:12:49] <jbw> that's the one
[09:12:51] <jbw> thanks so much
[09:13:06] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:14:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/GCjuu/
[09:14:20] <duch_kazatel> lasha - that works.
[09:14:31] <duch_kazatel> Not necessarily elegant, but it works ;)
[09:15:32] <lasha> no such thing is elegance
[09:15:35] <lasha> 0 or 1
[09:15:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:15:38] <lasha> works or doesn't work
[09:16:09] <duch_kazatel> you didn't see the almost 2,000 line monstrosity of decorators and interfaces that I have to rewrite recently.
[09:16:13] <tubiz> duch_kazatel how can I extend that to work with three image select
[09:16:51] <RRR2> yes, but there are things that work sloow
[09:17:15] <richcorbs> is there a way to do something like "$('#element').data.change(function…)"?
[09:17:32] <duch_kazatel> tubiz easy...
[09:17:46] <duch_kazatel> tubiz use classes ro IDs to run your targeting.
[09:18:03] <duch_kazatel> or are you new to javascript.
[09:18:20] <RRR2> richcorbs: I dunno, but I use element.onchange=function
[09:18:47] <lasha> richcorbs: what are you trying to do
[09:19:04] <lasha> detect a change event in a select menu?
[09:19:21] <lasha> $(element).change(function(){….});
[09:19:21] <richcorbs> trying to watch for changes in the elements data and then take action
[09:19:25] <tubiz> duch_kazatel am new to js
[09:19:38] <lasha> elements data specifically?
[09:19:44] <lasha> well, something has to change that data, right?
[09:19:47] <richcorbs> lasha: yes
[09:19:49] <lasha> you can just hook into THAT event
[09:19:53] <richcorbs> correct
[09:20:09] <lasha> so, what's resposible for changing the datas
[09:20:22] <richcorbs> there are multiple possibilities
[09:20:26] <duch_kazatel> tubiz you should probably learn some basics, then.  that's fairly trivial to setup.
[09:20:33] <RRR2> like keyboard controls
[09:20:45] <RRR2> tab, arrow keys, mouse
[09:20:59] <RRR2> perhaps some addon, or a script
[09:21:20] <richcorbs> that's why I was hoping for a single place to watch them all…but I could wrap the "set" action in a function that also would take the next action I need to do
[09:21:41] <RRR2> doesn't change work?
[09:22:25] <duch_kazatel> iirc .data() doesn't propogate changes like nodes do.
[09:22:28] <duch_kazatel> but I could be totally wrong.
[09:22:43] <lasha> well, you can actually look into the pub-sub pattern
[09:22:47] <lasha> and create your own thing
[09:22:49] <paddyez> hi
[09:23:00] <lasha> i don't think data changes emit
[09:23:02] <richcorbs> duch_kazatel: I'm seeing .data() NOT propagate changes
[09:23:03] <lasha> change events
[09:23:20] <RRR2> richcorbs, wait are you changing data?
[09:23:25] <richcorbs> yes
[09:24:12] <RRR2> richcorbs: onchange doesn't work like that it only works for values, on input tags, select, or textarea
[09:24:22] <richcorbs> thanks all…I'll look into pub-sub or wrapping the setter in a function that includes other actions.
[09:24:41] <lasha> the 2nd of those is probably the fastest route, richcorbs
[09:25:07] <bberry> Hey guys.  I have 3 ajax POSTs that need to be ordered because the 3rd POSTs callback function relies on the response of the first two POSTs.  here is what i have set up. http://jsfiddle.net/6Jdm2/  i'm new to jquery and have looked into "promises" but im not really understand how to use them.  would anyone mind helping me?
[09:25:13] <RRR2> So are you overwriting .data with your own function?
[09:25:20] <richcorbs> lasha: thanks
[09:25:24] <richcorbs> RRR2: yes
[09:25:51] <duch_kazatel> bberry you could always have each ajax call callback to the next one.
[09:26:02] <RRR2> interesting.. but you could simple do like a function wrapper like..
[09:26:16] <richcorbs> RRR2: good idea, I'll run away and try that
[09:26:22] <bberry> duch_kazatel: i was thinking about that... was trying to keep the code pretty.  thats basically my fallback solution :P
[09:26:51] <RRR2> richcorbs: function change(a,b){ChangeCounter.push([a,b]);return a.data(b)}
[09:27:01] <RRR2> or some crazy shit like that for your evil purposes
[09:28:10] <duch_kazatel> bberry here's the tuts+ thing on 'em: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[09:30:23] <bberry> duch_kazatel: oops accidently responded in ##js
[09:30:35] <duch_kazatel> it's fine.
[09:30:42] <bberry> duch_kazatel: thx for link D:
[09:30:44] <bberry> :D
[09:42:33] <jost> Is the codiqua-thing on the http://jquerymobile.com startpage broken for someone else?
[09:48:56] <jcgrv> Hello. Does anybody know jQuery's Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)? Or if there isn't one?
[09:52:40] <Bloomberg> Mornirng guys!!
[09:52:54] <CthdralComputer> anyone know how to remove an uploaded file from an HTML5 multiple input via jquery?
[09:53:15] <CthdralComputer> prior to uploading...ofcourse
[09:53:39] <duch_kazatel> jcgrv aren't ECCNs just for paid software?
[09:54:04] <duch_kazatel> i could be totally off.
[09:54:18] <CthdralComputer> basically I have a script that's taking the selected files and displaying each name in a table below the input with an option to delete one. The option is working (i.e. it is deleting it from the table) but it still gets uploaded, so it's still in the HMTL5 input
[10:10:23] <jcgrv> duch_kazatel No, some FOSS also have ECCNs. If jQuery doesn't have it, how could I prove it?
[10:17:43] <grafi> how do you prove that god doesnt exist?
[10:17:44] <grafi> :P
[10:23:47] <jedimind> grafi what?
[10:24:03] <grafi> what what?
[10:24:18] <grafi> proving that things dont exist is hard isnt it?
[10:25:00] <jedimind> just as hard as proving something exists
[10:25:39] <BillCriswell> grafi: Russell's teapot.
[10:26:26] <grafi> ha ;)
[10:27:32] <grafi> jedimind i think i want to disagree with that
[10:28:18] <BillCriswell> I serve the Great Potato.http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Great_Potato

[10:32:30] <lianzinho> guys, whats the best way to transfer an element from one position to another? I mean, I want to append it to an element but removing it from the original position
[10:34:00] <beatnyk> would someone please show me how to make 'COMPLETED!' display on the progressbar here when it finishes: http://jsfiddle.net/AndrewZhang/xpnY8/2/
[10:34:07] <beatnyk> i'd be extremely grateful!
[10:34:15] <grafi> lianzinho appendTo probably
[10:34:52] <lianzinho> grafi: but it will remove from where it was?
[10:35:13] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ look at the examples
[10:35:44] <talntid> beatnyk: if (done) { alert("done"); return; }
[10:36:08] <beatnyk> talntid I need the text to display on the progressbar itself when it completes though =(
[10:36:21] <beatnyk> I think I get what you're saying
[10:36:33] <talntid> I showed you where to do it. Make a div, and show it
[10:36:56] <talntid> make a div, position it properly, display:none; it, then show it if (done)
[10:37:45] <beatnyk> yep thats what i gathered
[10:37:58] <beatnyk> ill see if i can fiddle it working
[10:39:04] <lianzinho> grafi: it will! thanks
[10:39:27] <talntid> beatnyk, I don't want to do all the work for you, but I'll point you in the direction of how to do it if you get stuck. :)
[10:40:16] <beatnyk> talntid I think all I need to know is how to bring the div to life from the css rule display: none
[10:40:35] <talntid> also, instead of doing the if (done), looks like there is a complete.progressbar event you can watch
[10:40:36] <grafi> beatnyk http://jsfiddle.net/xpnY8/78/ line 148
[10:40:52] <talntid> use .show() to bring the div to life
[10:41:10] <beatnyk> oh crap I did it differently grafi
[10:44:58] <beatnyk> talntid i used show() but did I use it wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/AndrewZhang/xpnY8/2/
[10:45:26] <beatnyk> line 159
[10:46:13] <talntid> that doesn't appear to be saved... line 159 shows:  if (done) return;
[10:46:21] <beatnyk> oh
[10:46:55] <talntid> but really, where you should be putting the code is line 147
[10:46:56] <beatnyk> sorry about that http://jsfiddle.net/J7b45/
[10:47:01] <TheAbacus> It appears that jQuery CDN (http://code.jquery.com) has been down for the past 4 hours (at least). Anyone else experiencing this? Any expectation when it will return?
[10:47:08] <beatnyk> oh ok ill check it out
[10:47:44] <talntid> you should google how to use .show(). you are not using it properly :)
[10:48:06] <escher> TheAbacus:  It's fine on my end. Might want to traceroute it and see where it's dying.
[10:50:24] <beatnyk> lol ok got it to work here, but the green vanishes for some reason and is replaced with the text: http://jsfiddle.net/QA6BU/
[10:50:34] <beatnyk> any idea how to keep the green of the progressbar?
[10:51:19] <grafi> beatnyk why not just look at my example oô keeps the green, inserts text anything else it has to do?
[10:51:42] <beatnyk> grafi but I have to style the 'completed' text
[10:51:51] <TheAbacus> escher: Thanks. Anyone else have it down for them? Good to know it isn't a global outtage.
[10:51:59] <grafi> then do?
[10:52:06] <beatnyk> for example i gotta center it and change the font
[10:52:15] <beatnyk> will look at yours again
[10:53:22] <grafi> beatnyk http://jsfiddle.net/xpnY8/79/
[10:54:13] <beatnyk> ahh so that's how to do it
[10:54:18] <beatnyk> thanks a bunch
[10:54:23] <beatnyk> now i gotta style this sucker up better
[10:58:49] <escher> TheAbacus:  How comfortable are you with the terminal, and what OS are you using?
[11:19:47] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/kbqbvJ1B   Can't figure out why top is undefined   :-/
[11:23:05] <grafi> wrong selector maybe?
[11:23:22] <grafi> hard to tell withouth any html
[11:25:27] <digitalmediaguy> the item being selected was set to display:none
[11:25:30] <digitalmediaguy> doh
[11:28:13] <Zzaichik> that's not how you use scrollTop is it?
[11:29:39] <Zzaichik> just top should suffice
[11:34:16] <beatnyk> for some reason I can't duplicate this page.... http://jlyse.net/?sputPfd I can duplicate all of it but the progress bars will not work! =( does anyone know if there's some kind of secretive jumbo going on behind the scenes stopping the progress bars from working?
[11:40:45] <doug65536> beatnyk: looks faked to me
[11:41:25] <doug65536> beatnyk: every request was 304 not modified, so how did it know the progress?
[11:41:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah that page probably isn't real.
[11:44:08] <beatnyk> doug65536, indeed it is, just trying to duplicate it though for something else
[11:44:21] <beatnyk> proving to be a real pain in the butt
[11:53:53] <BillCriswell> beatnyk: You just want a progress bar updating at a random interval?
[11:54:20] <beatnyk> im trying to integrate it here: http://uploadwire.com/download/425/CodesPack.zip
[11:54:28] <beatnyk> there is already jquery code in the page though unfortunately
[11:54:45] <beatnyk> im not really a jquery guru...im one of those 'read code and piece things together' type of people =(
[11:55:07] <beatnyk> as you can see that page loads a gif image...i just think jquery would look more fancy
[11:59:02] <bberry> i have a friend that stated to me that he read on stackoverflow that jquery is "bloated". I'm not familiar enough with jquery, but i feel he is incorrect.  What should i say to convince him otherwise? (please be constructive, not demeaning!)
[11:59:48] <beatnyk> call him schoolyard names
[11:59:51] <beatnyk> it works everytime
[11:59:55] <bberry> lol
[12:00:21] <bberry> its a coworker that i dont talk to often. hes also german, so im not sure if itd translate well >.<
[12:00:27] <NoiseEee> bberry: tell him to load one less jpg instead.
[12:00:28] <beatnyk> i prefer names from that old movie sandlot, stuff like 'buffalo butt breath'
[12:01:28] <NoiseEee> bberry: also you can build/download the parts of jquery you need.
[12:02:40] <grafi> also zeptop
[12:02:43] <grafi> *zepto
[12:02:48] <bberry> NoiseEee: ah didnt know that
[12:02:53] <Wolf_22> Anyone know of a way to create a "dangling" effect for links in jQuery? I.e. - X-mas tree lights and when you move the mouse pointer over them, they would jiggle on the wire, etc.)
[12:03:02] <bberry> Also, here's how im using promises.... does this look okay? http://jsfiddle.net/G7Kh9/1/
[12:04:37] <beatnyk> Wolf_22: behold, dangly bits http://wagerfield.github.io/parallax/
[12:05:04] <Wolf_22> beatnyk: Thanks! :)
[12:05:23] <beatnyk> i love lookin at those nifty jquery demos
[12:06:17] <Wolf_22> beatnyk: Yeah, that's pretty cool but I originally envisioned something like those things that are hanging being the parts that move when the mouse moves over them vs. the entire page instead being the thing that moves... Know of anything like this?
[12:06:38] <beatnyk> there's tons of examples of fiddle
[12:07:00] <Wolf_22> k, I'll check 'em out. Thanks again. :)
[12:07:17] <beatnyk> http://jsfiddle.net/nfang/AxfdC/
[12:07:21] <beatnyk> that jiggles when you click it
[12:07:55] <beatnyk> Wolf_22 here's a good mouseover jiggle http://jsfiddle.net/kSbqW/
[12:08:34] <beatnyk> usually when you want to get something done in jquery you just google for what it is then toss site:jsfiddle.net at the end of your search query, chances are someone has already done it on the fiddle site
[12:09:15] <Wolf_22> beatnyk: K, thanks. I'll probably go with that first link because I think I can mold it around what I need... I'll give your search strategy a try, too.
[12:21:59] <jedimind> beatnyk that must be what its like for michael j fox to surf the internet
[12:43:55] <henny19> evening all, have a twitter aggregation system I have knocked up for displaying tweets on screens at events, The display side is a page that auto refreshes every 10 seconds, the problem i have is when internet access is a bit flaky it fails to refresh and i get errors on the screens, what im looking to do is only refresh if the server is there, could this be done in Jquery?
[12:46:44] <grafi> you could certainly check for a connection with javascript
[12:47:17] <grafi> window.navigator.online
[12:47:47] <grafi> also maybe pull the update with ajax, that way when it goes wrong the page just isnt refreshed
[13:07:52] <malorie> I'm looking for a lightbox plugin that has a full-page feature. i.e., it's automatically resizing the lightbox on a resize. can you recommend me something?
[13:14:27] <grafi> dont they all?
[13:14:46] <BillCriswell> malorie: I know fancybox does it.
[13:15:18] <grafi> because its fancy
[13:15:49] <malorie> ok. I'll take a look at it. there are just way too many plugins, though :\
[13:16:13] <grafi> im not convinced thats a bad thing
[13:16:22] <grafi> autoScale 	true 	If true, FancyBox is scaled to fit in viewport
[13:16:32] <malorie> well, it makes picking one harder
[13:17:17] <grafi> and easier
[13:17:32] <grafi> because exactly what you need has most likely been done already ^^
[13:17:41] <malorie> fair enough
[13:17:50] <grafi> :P
[13:18:21] <grafi> and for the general purpose stuff you usually can just pick the first hit off google

[13:35:22] <saoco> zakj: the "change" portion works, the "submit" portion does not.
[13:35:57] <saoco> submit = click

[14:41:04] <duch_kazatel> samholmes what?
[14:41:13] <duch_kazatel> that's a really generic question.
[14:41:43] <duch_kazatel> wait 5xx is error isn't?
[14:41:45] <samholmes> $.get(url, query, cb); cb doesn't trigger if request returns with a 500 status
[14:42:08] <duch_kazatel> isn't cb supposed to be the success callback?
[14:42:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's the success callback.

[15:10:39] <dwarder> i.e. if i call it like this func1;func2;func3;
[15:16:10] <zakj> dwarder: functions called like that will execute in succession; the trick is that it sounds like (at least) your func1 is calling an async function. you probably want to tie your calls to func2/func3 to the callback of your $.getJSON (or whatever func1 is calling)

[15:53:19] <Zzaichik> console.log('working') ?
[15:53:43] <miceiken> $('.playerAvatar img') wouldn't that select <div class="playerAvatar"><img /></div>?
[15:53:53] <Zzaichik> yes
[15:54:40] <miceiken> it doesnt :(
[15:55:14] <grafi> what does it do?
[15:55:14] <miceiken> oh actually it found many duh stupid me
[15:55:18] <grafi> :P
[15:55:35] <Zzaichik> That selector will look for that element. It probably won't find it if it doesn't exist on DOM Load. But what you've shown, the answer is yes it selects the img child of .playerAvatar
[16:12:09] <miceiken> So say an element has <li>TEXT<a>dropdown stuff</a></li>
[16:12:14] <miceiken> how can I get just TEXT?
[16:16:38] <sahbeewah> miceiken, you would usually be better off wrapping the text in a tag
[16:16:49] <miceiken> and when it's not my choice? :(
[16:17:13] <sahbeewah> you can call .contents() on the li element, which will return you an array of dom elements
[16:17:31] <sahbeewah> you can check the .nodeType property on dom elements to see if they are text nodes
[16:17:31] <duch_kazatel> you can also check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6138989/how-to-get-the-text-of-parent-element-using-jquery
[16:17:34] <sahbeewah> text nodes are == 3
[16:18:25] <miceiken> duch_kazatel, i tried that. but i am calling .text() on the parent and it also returns text of children
[16:20:14] <sahbeewah> does that not make sense?
[16:20:15] <frem_> Q: why is my form still being submitted after I preventDefault on the submission button click? http://jsfiddle.net/tCJga/4/
[16:21:15] <sahbeewah> frem_, you need to include jquery in jsfiddle options
[16:21:53] <frem_> doh! thanks, sahbeewah
[16:22:03] <miceiken> also, try return false; ?
[16:22:10] <duch_kazatel> miceiken you need to look at the edit - it has more info in line with what sahbeewah was suggesting.
[16:29:04] <ldexterldesign> hey
[16:29:11] <ldexterldesign> sorry, basic question i guess...
[16:29:25] <initself> TypeError: $(...).colResizable is not a function
[16:29:26] <initself> http://reports-test.candelacorp.com/dd/js/dd.js
[16:29:31] <ldexterldesign> what's the best alternative for the click toggle event, now toggle is depreciated?
[16:29:44] <initself> colResizable IS A FUNCTION
[16:30:32] <duch_kazatel> ldexterldesign huh?
[16:31:36] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:hey bud
[16:31:56] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:i have a read more (show/hide) button i need to code
[16:32:12] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:click 1 the button shows content above
[16:32:28] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:click 2 the button hides content above, again
[16:32:46] <grafi> why is toggle deprecated oô
[16:32:50] <duch_kazatel> where does it say toggle() is deprecated?
[16:32:53] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:32:55] <duch_kazatel> not seeing that.
[16:33:14] <duch_kazatel> the animation method still works.
[16:33:59] <ldexterldesign> sorry, i was looking here http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[16:34:04] <ldexterldesign> my bad
[16:34:05] <duch_kazatel> the eventing one is deprecated./
[16:34:10] <duch_kazatel> you need to check the state of the thing.
[16:34:16] <duch_kazatel> instead of just toggling.
[16:34:52] <ldexterldesign> so i was using toggle() anyway, but my button kept disappearing?
[16:35:03] <ldexterldesign> so i reverted back to trying to solve it with click()
[16:35:27] <duch_kazatel> i use .on('click', function(){/* event handler here */})
[16:35:57] <ldexterldesign> $('.foo').toggle(function(){ // click 1 }, function(){ // click 2 }) - correct way to go?
[16:36:09] <duch_kazatel> ldexterldesign no, that no longer works.
[16:36:21] <duch_kazatel> the toggle() animation still works.  that no longer works for events/
[16:36:39] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:ahh, i've used on() - i go with that for all events from now on
[16:36:48] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:i'll*
[16:37:02] <duch_kazatel> it's a preference of mine - some folks prefer the .click syntax, but I have my own preferences for using .on()
[16:37:17] <duch_kazatel> reads better to me.  others can (and probably do) disagree.
[16:38:02] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  .on('click', function() { var el = $(this), toggled = el.data('toggled'); if (toggled) { do somth } else { do smth }  el.data('toggled', !toggled); })
[16:38:13] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[16:38:29] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:ok, would you be kind enough to give me rough syntax to start me off solving my problem?
[16:38:41] <duch_kazatel> shoky just gave it to you.
[16:38:43] <ldexterldesign> shoky:ahh, cheers bra ;)
[16:38:45] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:38:49] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:;)

[16:38:55] <duch_kazatel> D:
[16:39:11] <ldexterldesign> on()wards and upwards!
[16:39:16] <ldexterldesign> kind thanks
[16:41:31] <initself> i dont understand how to use http://quocity.com/colresizable/
[16:41:38] <initself> you donm't just tack the function onto the dom object
[16:41:43] <initself> some kind of callback required?
[16:42:58] <duch_kazatel> load the plugin, run $("table").colResizable();
[16:43:16] <initself> duch_kazatel: not working for me....
[16:43:36] <initself> the sample i just checked doesn't seem to using jQuery in the normal ways

[16:44:30] <duch_kazatel> that worked for me.
[16:44:49] <initself> shoky: where are you loading that function?
[16:44:54] <shoky> initself: wha?
[16:44:58] <initself> External resources
[16:45:04] <shoky> yes?
[16:45:10] <initself> weird, i wonder what's going on for me...
[16:45:18] <duch_kazatel> initself what are you doing?
[16:45:18] <shoky> it doesnt work with new jquery
[16:45:26] <shoky> needs < 1.9
[16:45:30] <initself> crap
[16:45:36] <initself> i wonder why that is

[17:08:36] <grafi> duch_kazatel has crazy skills :D

[17:13:07] <initself> i wish this worked
[17:13:17] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:was your last response to me?
[17:13:27] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:"$ is not defined. "
[17:14:08] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:14:13] <duch_kazatel> is your console open?
[17:15:17] <duch_kazatel> ldexterldesign you should have your console open to help you catch simple small errors.
[17:15:41] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:i have. no error :|
[17:16:00] <duch_kazatel> on jsbin that page isn't giving you an error?
[17:16:13] <duch_kazatel> because it sure as hell doesn't look like you're including jquery to me.
[17:18:14] <duch_kazatel> and ldexterldesign there is no data('toggled') defined on first click.
[17:18:35] <duch_kazatel> so that first click adds it, then the second click runs like it should.
[17:20:22] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:yea, sorry, i just pasted the code snippet-only
[17:20:35] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:i'll remember to hotlink the cdn next time
[17:21:56] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:hmm, i need it to work on the first click really...
[17:22:13] <duch_kazatel> ldexterldesign think about it mang.
[17:22:22] <duch_kazatel> ldexterldesign this is pretty easy.
[17:22:23] <ldexterldesign> duch_kazatel:haha, i am!

[19:41:05] <neworder> Hi guys
[19:41:19] <neworder> I have a image with class name "remove_image"
[19:41:48] <neworder> I mean remove_product
[19:42:23] <txt23> On this http://jsfiddle.net/4bvGA/1 I want to set width to 33% of columns are 3 and 25% if they are 4. How can I do that?
[19:42:39] <neworder> so I do something like this when document is ready,  $(".remove_product").click(deleteCompareProduct);
[19:43:03] <neworder> The problem now is that
[19:43:12] <neworder> when I dynamically insert this image
[19:43:27] <neworder> I can't remove it
[19:43:52] <neworder> I mean the onclick event doesn't work as this image is dynamically inserted
[19:44:00] <neworder> Does anyone get what I mean?
[19:44:02] <neworder> =)
[19:46:49] <txt23> How do you set % in width in JS?
[19:47:34] <jphase> txt23: something like http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/4bvGA/2/
[19:48:17] <txt23> Thanks!
[19:49:16] <jphase> neworder: really hard to help you without knowing what deleteCompareProduct is
[19:49:33] <neworder> hmm
[19:49:54] <neworder> Basically I want to add a onclick function to a dynamically created element
[19:50:26] <txt23> jphase: It worked. So basically I need to have ID for the table?
[19:51:28] <jphase> neworder: just bind your .click or what-not to the element before you insert it into the DOM
[19:52:06] <neworder> Ah I see
[19:52:06] <jphase> txt23: you don't need an ID no, I was just targeting your specific table with the ID you used
[19:52:08] <neworder> Lemme tr

[20:13:22] <neworder> I have a javascript function
[20:13:27] <neworder> with a this reference
[20:13:42] <ldexterldesign> jphase:ta man
[20:13:57] <neworder> When I call this function with $('.target').function()
[20:13:59] <neworder> it works
[20:14:21] <neworder> but when I trigger the function using inline onclick
[20:14:25] <neworder> It doesn't work
[20:14:38] <neworder> The "this" reference seems to be the problem
[20:14:54] <neworder> Anyone understands what I'm getting at? =)
[20:16:05] <jphase> neworder: when I said bind the .click to the element before you insert it I didn't mean an inline onclick attribute though
[20:16:19] <neworder> Ah I see
[20:16:33] <neworder> but an inline onclick would work too right
[20:16:43] <jphase> $('<div>').click(function() { alert('something'); }).appendTo($('body'));
[20:16:57] <jphase> I suppose, that just seems dirty to me to add an inline onclick
[20:17:06] <jphase> and this in an onclick != $(this) in jQuery
[20:17:27] <neworder> oh!
[20:17:51] <neworder> So what should I do to make them refer to the link I clicked on
[20:19:14] <jphase> neworder: it's really hard to tell without seeing anything you're talking about. I can only guess, but I would probably create my remove/delete button at the same time I create my other element I need to delete, then relate them with a rel="" attribute or something
[20:19:41] <neworder> Hmm I see
[20:19:52] <jphase> or you could bind a click event to the remove button which then says something like $(this).parent().parent().remove(); type of thing
[20:19:57] <jphase> make it relative to the DOM structure
[20:20:22] <jphase> there's plenty of ways to do what I'm trying my best to guess what you're trying to do but if you need much more help I'd suggest making a jsfiddle
[20:21:27] <neworder> hmm ok thanks
[20:21:51] <neworder> my delete product function is something like this  $(this).parent().parent().remove();
[20:22:05] <neworder> so now I want to call this function using inline onclick
[20:22:10] <neworder> It should work too right
[20:22:45] <neworder> <img class="remove_cmp_pdt" src="x-sml-cart.png"; ?>" onclick="deleteCompareProduct()" alt="">
[20:22:53] <jphase> in theory yeah, you could make a named function and call it with an inline onclick, but why do that?
[20:22:53] <neworder> I'm dynamically inserting the above image
[20:23:06] <jphase> you're dynamically creating the element so just bind to it as you make it
[20:23:17] <neworder> Oh ok
[20:23:44] <neworder> var $ximg = '<img class="remove_cmp_pdt" src="x-sml-cart.png"; ?>" alt="">';
[20:24:14] <jphase> hmm
[20:24:22] <neworder> $ximg.onclick() { deleteCompareProduct() }
[20:24:25] <jphase> try building like this instead...
[20:24:33] <neworder> will something like this work
[20:24:34] <neworder> hehe
[20:25:18] <jphase> literally like...  $('<img>').addClass('remove_cmp_pdt').attr({src: 'x-sml-cart.png', alt: '').click(function(){ // Delete your element }).appendTo($('body'));
[20:25:33] <jphase> something similar to that anyhow
[20:25:46] <neworder> Hmm I see
[20:26:08] <jphase> it's easier to build with a jQuery DOM object when it comes to events imo, rather than using .html() and passing a string
[20:26:30] <neworder> Hmm ok
[20:26:44] <neworder> Why is inline onclick discouraged
[20:28:30] <jphase> well it's kinda "ghetto" in this case, jQuery DOM objects can all be modified in memory, and if you bind the event with .click or .on or what-not, then you don't need to have gross markup
[20:28:41] <jphase> I'm not going to say it's not possible, just not optimal
[20:29:26] <jphase> and once you get used to dynamically creating elements in jQuery with DOM objects, you'll not want to use .html unless you have a good reason for it
[20:29:32] <jphase> DOM objects ftw <3
[20:31:15] <neworder> haha alright thanks
[20:31:53] <jphase> np
[20:34:48] <neworder> <img class="remove_cmp_pdt" src="x-sml-cart.png"; ?>" onclick="deleteCompareProduct()" alt="">
[20:34:53] <neworder> When clicking this
[20:35:25] <neworder> When clicking this image, the $(this) inside the function does not refer to the image
[20:35:44] <neworder> I am quite puzzled as to why that would be the case
[20:35:50] <neworder> Am I not clicking on the image
[20:37:36] <jphase> yeah, like I said, not $(this) isn't the same as this. If you want to continue your inline approach (boooo) then try passing deleteCompareProduct(this) as a param to your function
[20:37:43] <jphase> -not
[20:38:55] <neworder> haha
[20:38:58] <neworder> I see
[20:44:36] <frothnicator> Is there a jQuery method to get the URL's GET parameters?  i.e., if I surf to "http://localhost:8000/?a=1&b=2&c=", how could a script running on that page get access to an object like "{ a: 1, b: 2, c: null }"?
[20:45:35] <jphase> frothnicator: I only know how to do that with regex
[20:45:46] <jphase> but you could make your own method, sure
[20:46:23] <jphase> oh, looks like there is some plugins actually if you wanted to go that route
[20:47:06] <frothnicator> jphase: ooh; twould appear then that your google is better than my google.  Could you paste a link to what you're seeing?
[20:48:33] <jphase> frothnicator: hmm, I wouldn't use any of these "plugins" though, check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values#901144
[20:48:52] <frothnicator> jphase: thank you.  Reading now ...
[20:48:56] <jphase> looks like a good application for regex imo
[20:52:08] <frothnicator> jphase: oh don't get me wrong; I /love/ regex's and consider myself a pro at them. However, I'm worried about the corner cases of the problem that I might be missing.  That link you gave me suggests some already, so thank you for that.
[20:53:27] <jphase> word
[21:22:07] <EasyCo> If you do something like $( '.someclass' ).find( 'ul' ).toggle(); and there are many ULs, it's default behaviour for jquery to loop through them and apply toggle.  Is this correct?
[21:26:03] <neworder> var $ximg = '<img class="remove_cmp_pdt" src="x-sml-cart.png"; ?>" alt="">';
[21:26:15] <neworder> How do I bind an onclick event to this variable
[21:26:24] <neworder> jquery variable
[21:26:55] <EasyCo> $( $ximg ).on('click', function() {});
[21:27:15] <neworder> Oh thanks!
[21:33:18] <Jayden90> is there a way to create a custom "enter" event to listen on? i.e. $("button").on('click enter', function(event) { …
[21:33:35] <Jayden90> getting sick of using "keypress" with if (event.type == 'click' || event.which == 13) { …
[21:35:05] <snover> yes
[21:35:11] <snover> extension even
[21:35:21] <snover> oops, sorry, never mind, i thought this was #dojo
[21:44:57] <EasyCo> Jayden90: Yes
[21:45:58] <EasyCo> Jayden90: I did before but don't remember all too well, check this SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/399867/custom-events-in-jquery/14840483#14840483
[21:46:08] <Jayden90> EasyCo: Looking now :)
[21:51:37] <unnu> jphase, you around?
[21:51:45] <Jayden90> EasyCo: this answer further down seems spot on: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5689145/1596978
[21:52:07] <jphase> unnu: sup?
[21:52:21] <unnu> i went back to the mail page i am making
[21:52:30] <EasyCo> Cooll
[21:52:30] <unnu> the jquery doesn't seem to be updating the dom with .append
[21:52:36] <unnu> its REALLY annoying
[21:52:43] <jphase> unnu: you have an example?
[21:52:53] <unnu> not without dumping a page
[21:52:56] <unnu> i can link you in pm
[21:52:59] <jphase> sure
[22:03:19] <Jayden90> EasyCo: The answer I last linked works awsomely using $("button").enterkey(function(event) { … , but how can I get it to also work as $("button").on('click enterkey', function(event) { …
[22:04:36] <EasyCo> Jayden90: That should work?
[22:05:32] <Jayden90> Just the first. Only think I did difirently from the answer is renaming "enterKey" to "enterkey"
[22:06:50] <Jayden90> EasyCo: There must be a way to set up both and not just the first
[22:30:53] <Jayden90> EasyCo: Could not get an answer, so I just thought logically and built the solution in just 5 small lines. If your interested I could put it up somewhere.
[22:31:11] <EasyCo> Jayden90: Yes would love to see.
[22:31:57] <guy> Does anyone know of an alternative to http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/
[22:32:15] <guy> Unfortunately, the latter does not have all the options that I would like to have.
[22:41:14] <Jayden90> EasyCo: https://gist.github.com/jaydenseric/7113093
[22:42:16] <EasyCo> Ahh right, you went the other way. Good stuff.
[22:42:53] <EasyCo> I'l give 'er a star
[22:43:47] <Jayden90> :)
[22:51:33] <lasha> what's up everyone?
[23:15:01] <lite_> http://plnkr.co/edit/RjnYaOAfMbcwtmwyO4mN?p=preview what am I doing wrong here? What is causing jquery to not load in time for my directive to have an "on" ?
[23:39:27] <codemagician> Can anybody help me get and set the "4.30pm - 6.30pm" text from this HTML construct using jquery <input type="radio" name="check-in-am-pm" id="check-in-am-pm" value="am">8.30am - 12.30pm</label>
[23:39:57] <Cork> $('#check-in-am-pm').text()
[23:40:51] <codemagician> Cork: the text belongs to the outer label
[23:41:07] <Cork> what?
[23:41:25] <Cork> ah
[23:41:34] <Cork> you missed the starting tag of the label
[23:41:37] <codemagician> sorry, irc lost the outer <label> ta
[23:41:47] <codemagician> when I pasted
[23:41:53] <Cork> $('#check-in-am-pm').parent().text()
[23:42:12] <Cork> as long as you arn't using a textarea element that would work
[23:42:31] <Cork> else you would have to modify the content of the page
[23:42:47] <codemagician> cork, great.  what about if I want to set it?
[23:42:56] <Cork> you can't basically
[23:43:06] <Cork> cause the text is in the same element as the input
[23:43:10] <codemagician> can i do parent().text('something')
[23:43:20] <Cork> sure, but you would lose the input element
[23:43:36] <codemagician> i see
[23:43:55] <codemagician> is there a way to preserve the existing DOM element but only change the text portion?
[23:44:00] <Cork> i would change the html to ==> <input type="radio" name="check-in-am-pm" id="check-in-am-pm" value="am"><label for="check-in-am-pm">8.30am - 12.30pm</lable>
[23:44:21] <Cork> codemagician: not with the structure you have right now no
[23:44:33] <codemagician> unfortunately, that structure was generated by the php framework
[23:45:10] <Cork> then you are left with serializing the dom to html search replace in the string
[23:45:15] <Cork> and then parse the html back to dom
[23:45:23] <Cork> and hope you didn't lose any event listeners in the process
[23:45:39] <codemagician> yeah, i hadn't considered that
[23:46:09] <Cork> var label = $('#check-in-am-pm').parent(); label.html(label.html().replace('8:30', '10:30'));
[23:46:09] <codemagician> typically, how would you write the HTML to avoid this problem
[23:46:25] <Cork> codemagician: like i showed you
[23:46:31] <Cork> or wrap the content in a span
[23:46:55] <Cork> basically you want an element with just the text in it
[23:47:06] <codemagician> i see the example now, irc is a little slow here
[23:47:09] <Cork> <label><input type="radio" name="check-in-am-pm" id="check-in-am-pm" value="am"><span>8.30am - 12.30pm</span></label>
[23:47:36] <Cork> but this would mean you don't have to add any extra elements <input type="radio" name="check-in-am-pm" id="check-in-am-pm" value="am"><label for="check-in-am-pm">8.30am - 12.30pm</lable>
[23:51:19] <codemagician> Cork, thanks for your help.  The replace method will work fine as I just wanna change the times by 1hour for a particular date in a jquery datepicker
[23:51:45] <Cork> codemagician: just remember that you are replacing the input field
[23:51:53] <Cork> so all event listeners added to it will be lost
[23:51:59] <Cork> (and .data())
[23:52:18] <codemagician> Cork, so replace will generate a string and rebuild the DOM right?
[23:52:39] <Cork> html() will serialize the dom .replace() just just a string search and replace
[23:52:54] <Cork> and then the first .html() call parses the html back into dom
[23:53:07] <codemagician> gotcha
[23:53:28] <codemagician> fortunately, this is a simple form so no event listeners are attached to this part of the DOM
