[00:37:58] <iaj> hi folks.. is there some slider plugin for jquery which you can recommen? ressource wise and eye-candy/feature wise?
[00:38:08] <iaj> for generating sliding headers
[04:02:06] <freezo> Hi, im trying to get this countdown with the style --> http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown/
[04:02:21] <freezo> to this jsfiddle --> https://jsfiddle.net/19owbcqg/
[04:03:11] <freezo> But countdown not starts
[04:20:15] <Al_nz1> is there some trick to resetting a bootstrap button dropdown in a modal? because $('#supervisor').val=(''); doesnt do it
[04:33:28] <iaj> hi folks.. is there some slider plugin for jquery which you can recommen? resource wise and eye-candy/feature wise? =)
[04:41:37] <pavonia> freezo: There's no element with ID "main-example-template"
[04:42:55] <pavonia> Hhm, replacing it by "#main-example" has an interesting effect ^^
[04:43:22] <freezo> pavonia :D hehe ok
[04:44:04] <freezo> It should be an example of how he is doing this.. but didnt find it on his website
[07:34:22] <anli> Please, correct me if I am wrong, but did microsoft just create a browser without kiosk mode?
[08:14:07] <freezo> How can hide "days" if it is == 00    --> https://jsfiddle.net/j9y53aut/
[08:14:34] <freezo> How can I hide*
[08:30:14] <MikeD_> freezo: do have the specs for "FlipClock" ?
[08:30:50] <freezo> yes, this is the doc -- > http://flipclockjs.com/
[08:35:32] <MikeD_> have you tried changing the clockFace based on the days==0?
[08:35:48] <MikeD_> HourlyCounter instead of DailyCounter
[08:41:32] <MikeD_> freezo: have you seen this flipclock show - instead of numbers?
[08:42:25] <freezo> that I wanna do is to hide days if it is == 0 days
[08:42:42] <MikeD_> yeah. and if you use "HourlyCounter" that's what you get
[08:42:57] <freezo> oh, nice =)
[08:43:04] <freezo> where did you find that?
[08:43:15] <MikeD_> the clock on their page is hourlycounter
[08:45:19] <freezo> https://jsfiddle.net/j9y53aut/3/
[08:46:11] <MikeD_> oh, using negative countdown is weird-looking
[08:46:52] <freezo> they should have an example of how use the code :P
[08:47:04] <freezo> how to*
[08:47:25] <MikeD_> yeah, their api/spec is pretty unhelpful
[08:47:36] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/j9y53aut/4/
[08:49:41] <MikeD_> if the date is already past, you get negative signs throughout the time display
[08:50:58] <MikeD_> so keep that in mind if you're using this for a countdown timer on a deal... and someone forgets to "fix" the deal page when the timer reaches zero, because you'll be showing site visitors that you screwed up :)
[09:09:48] <MikeD_> freezo: if you format the source so you can read it nicely, you can find the "DailyCounter" face and see all the other named functions defined near it
[09:11:07] <MikeD_> ex: TwentyFourHourClockFace, MinuteCounterFace, etc.  my guess is that the clockface option is whatever input plus "Face" and tries to use that function
[09:11:15] <MikeD_> s/function/object
[09:14:39] <freezo> trying :D
[09:15:36] <MikeD_> fwiw, by format the source so you can read it nicely i meant something like jstool format or similar online javascript beautifier
[09:53:05] <cocoabro> Hello, I'm trying to select a get this code to work on the fly, however it only applies the code when the div's are expanded.
[09:53:26] <cocoabro> https://gist.github.com/cocoabro/d370130ec7dfcbf63aeb490bd3b3f1e6
[09:54:31] <cocoabro> do I have to use each div that it is nested within in order to expand it?
[09:54:41] <JrWebDev> can JQuery process css animations or should i use jquery .animate?  im using .css(transform, scale(.66) translate(500px, 200px) yet it does not animate. it just jumps straight to the translation
[10:05:49] <MikeD_> JrWebDev: that doesn't look like an animation to me, it's just a presentation state
[10:08:13] <freezo> MikeD_ I saw u linked https://jsfiddle.net/j9y53aut/4/
[10:08:28] <MikeD_> yeah
[10:08:37] <MikeD_> it's one way you could go
[10:08:38] <freezo> Big thx, but can you explain where you check if date is 0
[10:09:13] <freezo> MikeD_ Cause I wanna also check hours and minutes and seconds
[10:09:16] <MikeD_> the face is based on there being enough "diff" - more than 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds time 1000 milliseconds
[10:10:25] <MikeD_> i write it like that because those numbers are easier to recognize than 86400000
[10:10:40] <freezo> yeah ofcourse
[10:10:58] <freezo> How can I continue to add Hours, min, sec also
[10:11:17] <MikeD_> is there a minute:second face?
[10:11:24] <MikeD_> that seems kinda weird to me
[10:11:55] <freezo> I mean if hours = 0 then hide it
[10:12:01] <MikeD_> well, idk i guess in some context it makes some sense
[10:12:01] <freezo> and if minutes = 0 the hide it
[10:13:15] <MikeD_> i guess you could start with the s-only face and if there are more than a minute worth, promote to ms, then if more than an hour, promote to hms, etc.
[10:14:28] <freezo> hmm.. ok
[10:15:07] <MikeD_> one of those other existing face options might already have that built in though
[10:16:25] <MikeD_> i feel like the typical use case for that kind of countdown is to show someone that time is running out... and the psychology of "zero days" and "zero hours" lends more urgency to the "act now" incentive
[12:46:17] <cocoabro> is there an easy way to selecting a div?
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> $('div')
[12:46:29] <cocoabro> oops*
[12:46:38] <cocoabro> I didn't mean to send that
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> hjahaha
[12:46:51] <cocoabro> Selecting a div within a div within a div within a div basically... :(
[12:47:06] <robertmaxrees> $('div > div > div > div')
[12:47:11] <robertmaxrees> or chck out .filter()
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[12:47:33] <cocoabro> Sorry, I haven't used jQuery in a while can I just show you what the structure looks like
[12:47:43] <cocoabro> https://gist.github.com/cocoabro/d370130ec7dfcbf63aeb490bd3b3f1e6
[12:48:46] <cocoabro> I updated it so that it doesn't look like shit robertmaxrees
[12:49:07] <robertmaxrees> where is this markup coming from?
[12:49:11] <cocoabro> Essentially, I am just trying to select ".recent-activity-item-time"
[12:49:17] <cocoabro> Zendesk
[12:49:36] <robertmaxrees> you're missing html in there.
[12:49:54] <cocoabro> I apologize.
[12:50:02] <cocoabro> there's a lot of internal information in there I can't post it
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, did you want the li with that class?
[12:50:34] <cocoabro> I just want to be able to change the text within the .recent-activity-item-time
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> is that not working at the moment?
[12:51:24] <cocoabro> yeah it doesn't get that at all, the only thing that works is recent-activity, and .recent-activity-list.
[12:51:34] <cocoabro> It works in console if I expand the entire structure.
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> any idea if zendesk is using ajax to power any of this??
[12:52:15] <robertmaxrees> or if things are gettign dynamically generated?
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> i ask because https://jsfiddle.net/aL81zj4d/
[12:52:51] <cocoabro> For recent activity, it is using Curlybars to generate {{recent_activity}}
[12:53:08] <cocoabro> Zendesk also sucks, because you cannot edit {{recent_activity}}
[12:53:11] <robertmaxrees> so it's dynamically generated after the page loads - that's likely your issue.
[12:53:47] <cocoabro> Right that definitely makes more sense now!
[12:53:56] <robertmaxrees> so document ready won't work.
[12:54:01] <cocoabro> so running the script after the content is generated would be better.
[12:54:12] <cocoabro> thanks.
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.

[14:10:27] <alex___> good afternoom
[14:13:48] <ether_> Can you execute a conditional within a conditional?
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> ether you mean the ? : operator?
[14:16:20] <robertmaxrees> because if so, yes.  it's a statement - but I'd be real careful doing that.
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to read.
[14:17:00] <ether_> No, I'm trying to run an if x, do y, else do z. But in y it will also have a conditional, where the else points it to z
[14:22:21] <pavonia> You can also nest if-statements
[14:29:17] <ExoUNX> Thanks jQuery! You helped me push out a quick change for a development meeting!
[14:29:20] <ExoUNX> <3
[14:30:00] <ether_> pavonia could you help me figure out why this conditional is breaking? I think it has something to do with the nesting but I can post a fiddle
[14:30:45] <pavonia> Perhaps, please show the code
[14:34:49] <ether_> Here is my code, the problem I have is on line 121, It has a conditional asking if a user wants to see examples. If user says "no" it continues, if "yes" it doesn't begin the conditonal code - https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/
[14:40:46] <pavonia> ether_: You nesting is wrong, you put conditional into other conditionals that can't return true. The pattern should be like: if (val=="3a") {...} else if (val = "3b") {...} else {...}
[14:41:06] <pavonia> Possibly with extra "else if"s
[14:42:32] <ether_> My original "if val_3a" does have the else if "3b" which works, but it doesn't fire the function if they do choose 3a
[14:57:25] <pavonia> ether_: It's inside (val == 3). Do you want to check for a prefix there?
[14:58:10] <ether_> So I just rewrote it now, it's if val 3 else val 4. So they should specificly be scoped inside val 3's conditional, i'll update fiddle
[14:58:37] <ether_> https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/2/   Still can't get my console to appear on clicking 3a
[15:01:46] <pavonia> ether_: How do you test if the right command is fired?
[15:02:08] <ether_> By using the test example, and whether it sends the next message
[15:02:37] <ether_> If I hit "I'm fine thanks" when it asks for examples, it goes to 3b, but it freezes up on 3a
[15:06:03] <pavonia> The problem is that you run 3a and 3b inside of 3, I think, so if val == "3" is can't be any of the others
[15:07:58] <ether_> Ohhh I got ya, let me try something 1 sec
[15:11:46] <ether_> yup, that was it, thanks for the help!
[16:32:22] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[16:36:46] <VectorX> trying to highlight text while typing in the input, trying to get the first part going but having some issues https://jsfiddle.net/6fbLdtxw/8/
[16:37:55] <VectorX> first part, highlight the inut text that matches in the li, second part highlight the matches in the li that matches with the input text
[16:50:12] <ngharo> VectorX: simpler approach maybe https://jsfiddle.net/6fbLdtxw/10/
[16:51:05] <VectorX> ngharo nice
[16:51:52] <VectorX> ngharo any thoughts on the second part
[16:52:49] <VectorX> so 'LoremIpsum' is typed 'Lorem Ipsum' should highlight
[16:53:24] <ngharo> so ignore spaces?
[16:53:32] <ngharo> hmm
[16:54:21] <VectorX> ngharo well the way i was looking at it was, reverse match the words in the li, with what is typed
[16:54:49] <VectorX> so similar to what i had before, split the text in li, and match the words against what is typed
[16:55:02] <VectorX> but perhaps you see a more elegant solution
[16:55:16] <VectorX> perhaps match 2 or more characters from that direction
[16:56:04] <VectorX> for instance, 'Lorem simply' should highlight the words 'Lorem' and 'simply'
[16:56:17] <ngharo> oh i see
[16:57:12] <VectorX> i basically want to highlight what is being typed, but it doesnt do it if the typed text is out of order etc
[16:57:25] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/6fbLdtxw/11/
[16:58:37] <VectorX> close, ignores loremsimply
[16:59:43] <ngharo> yeah this approach wouldnt be effective for "loremsimply" matching "Lorem" and "simply"
[17:02:06] <VectorX> cool gonna head home, ill play with it and see if i can make any changes, thanks it was a great help
[17:02:19] <ngharo> np, good luck
[17:02:52] <VectorX> thanks
