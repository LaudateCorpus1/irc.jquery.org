[00:00:16] <Chulbul> because you have used locationUrl != "" in if condition .. alert before if event is working fine
[00:01:24] <symfonius> ah
[00:01:25] <symfonius> silly me
[00:01:26] <symfonius> thanks
[00:12:23] <Shai_Tan> I have a script which has stopped working. I have tried to debug it, but firebug does not show any errors
[00:12:39] <Shai_Tan> http://kirtan.fm
[00:13:20] <Cork> "a script"?
[00:13:51] <Shai_Tan> some code
[00:13:59] <Cork> lol
[00:14:09] <Cork> "i have a problem, how do i fix it"?
[00:14:16] <Shai_Tan> call it what you like, currently, I call it not working
[00:14:17] <Cork> you think we are mind readers or something?
[00:14:21] <Shai_Tan> yes
[00:14:31] <Cork> ok, i'll leave the problem for them then
[00:14:45] <Shai_Tan> good job
[00:15:10] <Shai_Tan> I am not asking how to fix it, I am asking how I can debug it
[00:15:19] <Shai_Tan> Cork: but feel free to be a dick
[00:15:46] <prohobo> WOAH WOAH
[00:15:50] <prohobo> hey
[00:15:51] <Cork> Shai_Tan: heh, ya, it's so totally me who is that :)
[00:16:15] <prohobo> heeeeyyyy
[00:25:44] <blackkbot> i find that a shoe is a good tool to remove bugs from walls
[00:26:01] <Shai_Tan> wing tips?
[00:26:22] <blackkbot> i tried a gun but it just let more bugs in
[00:28:19] <Shai_Tan> hmm, seems my toggle is no longer toggling
[00:30:13] <blackkbot> thats no bueno
[00:36:07] <prohobo> are jquery dialogs treated as popups?
[00:36:32] <prohobo> ie. should i worry about browsers that block popups
[00:36:59] <Shai_Tan> no
[00:37:20] <Shai_Tan> depends on what it is you are doing I guess
[00:38:25] <prohobo> killin' nazis
[00:51:33] <symfonius> thanks for your help earlier Chulbul
[01:19:09] <Ricaz> I use .keypress() on an input to then process it's .val() and put it in another input. However, it's 1 keypress behind for some reason. If I type 'asd' in the first input, only 'as' gets to the other.
[01:19:28] <Ricaz> Is this because it triggers on keydown and not keyup or something?
[01:22:21] <Mark_2> how can i emulate the fade-in effect on this website? http://bdmp-006.cafe24.com/bizdemo16987/main/main.php#
[01:26:14] <Omar-> Ricaz use .keyup()
[01:28:32] <Ricaz> Omar-: thanks, man :)
[01:29:42] <Omar-> you're welcome :)
[01:35:53] <PythDasch> Hi
[01:37:11] <PythDasch> Someone could help me to write the right selector
[01:37:37] <PythDasch> I'm trying to select all div except one div which is a child from the select one : http://pastebin.com/2AvAUrxx
[01:38:36] <Omar-> PythDasch wow
[01:38:43] <Omar-> i'll check it
[01:38:51] <PythDasch> Thank you
[01:39:05] <PythDasch> Omar-,
[01:40:02] <Omar-> if you select parent, you can unselect child
[01:40:13] <PythDasch> It's what I do no ?
[01:40:17] <Omar-> unless you detach it, hide it, remove
[01:40:51] <PythDasch> Yes but it's not the right selector
[01:40:54] <Omar-> overlay-text is a child of row-fluid
[01:41:14] <PythDasch> So I've to do .children().children() ?
[01:41:35] <Omar-> i'll check it just a sec
[01:41:57] <Omar-> if you provide a fiddle with CSS it would be better
[01:42:10] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/8swjfm3z/
[01:43:15] <Omar-> you want to prevent parent from fading if "overlay-text" is clicked right?
[01:45:22] <PythDasch> Omar-, Exactly
[01:45:30] <PythDasch> http://jsfiddle.net/8swjfm3z/
[01:45:58] <Omar-> pls add your css PythDasch
[01:46:03] <PythDasch> I think it will be easier to have like an absolute but I need it to be responsive :p so it's easier this way. But if I can't I will do it like this
[01:46:05] <PythDasch> Omar-,
[01:46:07] <PythDasch> there is the css
[01:46:30] <Omar-> nope, you forgot to hit "Update" in toolbar
[01:46:36] <PythDasch> ok done
[01:46:54] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/8swjfm3z/1/
[01:46:57] <Omar-> the new link
[01:47:05] <PythDasch> ha ok
[01:50:03] <PythDasch> It's a bit tricky
[01:51:26] <PythDasch> Omar-, did you find something ?
[01:53:48] <Omar-> PythDasch http://jsfiddle.net/8swjfm3z/2/
[01:54:19] <PythDasch> Nice, It's what I was searching for !
[01:54:22] <Omar-> easiest way is to stop running the function if overlay-text is click
[01:54:24] <PythDasch> thanks a lot Omar-  :)
[01:54:27] <Omar-> np :)
[01:54:33] <PythDasch> ok I will do it :)
[01:55:00] <infoget> Hi guys, I pretty new to ajax and I need help with it. I'm using library with name superbox, this function is executed when the DOM is fully loaded, but when I have added new item thought ajax, this library it's not bind to new item, so I loaded this library again after ajax respond, but this library is loaded twice on old items, how can I fix that?
[01:55:34] <Omar-> infoget delegate event to dynamically added elements
[01:55:46] <Cork> infoget: the lib needs to either use a delegate system (you need to modify it)
[01:55:55] <Omar-> e.g. $("static parent").on("click", "dynamic element", function
[01:55:59] <Cork> infoget: or you have to delay loading it until after the ajax call is complete
[01:56:07] <Mark_2> http://bdmp-006.cafe24.com/bizdemo16987/main/main.php#
[01:56:16] <Cork> Omar-: its a lib/framework not an event handler
[01:56:17] <Mark_2> does anybody know what kind of fade-in effect js this is? http://bdmp-006.cafe24.com/bizdemo16987/main/main.php#
[01:57:30] <Cork> Mark_2: looks like a simple fade
[01:57:36] <Omar-> Cork I misunderstood it
[01:59:13] <PythDasch> Omar-, I used this more, Because otherwise it's not completely good http://jsfiddle.net/8swjfm3z/3/
[01:59:56] <Mark_2> what’s a simple fade?
[02:00:00] <Mark_2> i cannot find it.
[02:01:10] <Mark_2> and i know this is not css3 room, but is there anyone who can put texts on this jquery slideshow plugin? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/community
[02:01:24] <Mark_2> i cannot put texts ON the images.
[02:01:24] <PythDasch> Mark_2, It's $('icon').fadeOut(500) $('container').fadeIn(400) that's a simple fade
[02:02:26] <Mark_2> what do i put instead of ‘icon’ and ‘container'?
[02:02:38] <Mark_2> why are there 2 of em?
[02:04:02] <infoget> Cork, Omar-, Am I understanding it clearly?   $(".superbox").on("click", ".superbox-list", function(){
[02:04:02] <infoget>     $(this).SuperBox();
[02:04:02] <infoget>   });
[02:04:50] <PythDasch> Mark_2, on the website you showed us there is a fadeOut from the little Icon and after the page fadeIn
[02:05:10] <Cork> infoget: no
[02:05:33] <Cork> infoget: the plugin SuperBox doesn't support dynamically added elements
[02:05:48] <Cork> so you have to either run it after all the dynamic elements has been added
[02:06:05] <Cork> or if possible (if the plugin supports that) run it on only the new elements
[02:06:22] <Cork> jquery can't really help you here
[02:06:33] <Cork> as it is limitations in the plugin
[02:08:21] <Mark_2> <script>
[02:08:22] <Mark_2> $('.banner').fadeIn(400)
[02:08:22] <Mark_2> </script>
[02:08:26] <Mark_2> doesn’t seem to be working though.
[02:08:56] <infoget> Cork: Ok, thank you
[02:11:50] <Omar-> PythDasch good one!
[02:12:00] <Omar-> infoget yes this is delegation
[02:13:20] <Omar-> Mark_2 fadeIn for invisible elements
[02:13:27] <Cork> Mark_2: http://jsfiddle.net/9827snom/
[02:13:51] <infoget> Omar-: thanks, but in my case, it wasn't helpful
[02:15:19] <Cork> and a version without the scrollbars http://jsfiddle.net/9827snom/1/
[02:17:23] <Cork> and an alternative solution http://jsfiddle.net/9827snom/2/
[02:18:45] <Mark_2> cork: do you know a jquery plugin that scrolls to a certian point when i click on the button?
[02:19:30] <Mark_2> like this webpage http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/demo9/
[02:19:56] <Cork> Mark_2: $(window).animate({ scrollTop: point }, time);
[02:20:09] <Cork> if you want more advanced features check scrollTo
[02:20:15] <Cork> ?g jquery scrollTo
[02:20:16] <b-ot> Cork: flesler/jquery.scrollTo · GitHub → https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[02:20:34] <Mark_2> thanks guys.
[02:20:42] <Mark_2> i just need to solve the z-index problem then.
[02:22:14] <Mark_2> the jquery slideshow plugin won’t let me prioritize texts over the slideshow anybody know what the problem is? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/community
[02:23:41] <Cork> it doesn't even load
[02:24:04] <Mark_2> it’ll load, it’s taking some time.
[02:38:51] <beepbeep_> I'm looking for the same functionality as "on()" provides, except that I don't have an event to listen to, I just have to call a function on the jquery object, nothing more.
[02:39:04] <beepbeep_> $('.foo').foo();
[02:39:05] <beepbeep_> basically
[02:39:19] <beepbeep_> but more .foo's might be added to the dom
[02:39:27] <Cork> so, you want to add an extra method to jquery?
[02:39:35] <beepbeep_> I already have that
[02:39:43] <Cork> or you mean you want to know when the dom is modified?
[02:39:53] <Cork> .on is just an event handler
[02:39:56] <beepbeep_> basically, I want to know when a .foo is added to the dom yes
[02:40:02] <Cork> .on it it self doesn't do any checking
[02:40:03] <beepbeep_> so that I can call foo() on it
[02:40:22] <Cork> the closest you can get is mutationobservers
[02:40:30] <Cork> but not it is quite new and many browsers doesn't support it
[02:40:36] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobserver
[02:40:38] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[02:40:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Browser_compatibility
[02:40:56] <beepbeep_> I can't do that
[02:41:01] <Cork> ie >= 11 is prob the biggest one
[02:41:07] <Cork> beepbeep_: then you can't do it
[02:41:07] <beepbeep_> yep
[02:41:12] <beepbeep_> I need to support IE9
[02:41:24] <Cork> you would have to have the code that adds the element notify you about it
[02:41:45] <beepbeep_> Cork, ofcourse
[02:42:09] <beepbeep_> I will probably do that, thought that there must have been a better way
[02:42:13] <beepbeep_> mutation observer for example
[02:42:16] <beepbeep_> too bad I can't use it :(
[02:42:17] <beepbeep_> :D
[02:42:23] <beepbeep_> oh well, I'll dispatch an event
[02:42:23] <beepbeep_> thx!
[02:42:29] <Cork> mutation observer actually isn't a better solution
[02:42:48] <Cork> but if you absolutely can't get the source to tell you it is the next best thing
[02:43:31] <Cork> the worst possible solution (that sadly isn't completely uncommon) is a constant setInterval pulling for the element!!!
[02:43:39] <Cork> and that is a horrible solution
[02:44:05] <beepbeep_> :)
[02:44:18] <beepbeep_> bit weird yes
[02:44:19] <beepbeep_> oh well
[02:44:24] <beepbeep_> thx for advice!
[02:48:19] <anli> How can I get the document width that is used in media queries?
[02:48:51] <anli> Seems to not be document.body.offsetWidth nor document.body.clientWidth
[02:48:58] <anli> Because those values are a bit small
[02:50:24] <anli> Seems to be an answer on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11309859/css-media-queries-and-javascript-window-width-do-not-match
[03:34:48] <kpl> The jq-ui datepicker has a mobile wrapper (which is listed on the jqm page): https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-datepicker-wrapper   On the github page there is a link to a demo: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1375/edit    However, when I open the datepicker with data-inline="false", it is transparent. How can we fix that?
[03:42:26] <hrusti> http://jsfiddle.net/hfmc328f/1/
[03:42:35] <hrusti> how to get rid of vertical scroll
[03:42:58] <hrusti> horizontal even
[03:46:55] <Cork> hrusti: what do you want to happen instead?
[03:47:03] <Cork> just crop the row?
[03:47:05] <hrusti> i dont want scroll
[03:48:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hfmc328f/2/http://jsfiddle.net/hfmc328f/2/
[03:48:07] <Cork> opps
[03:48:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hfmc328f/2/
[03:48:16] <Cork> you won't be able to see the last column now though
[03:48:20] <Omar-> kpl i guess the demo is imcomplete
[03:48:35] <Omar-> incomplete*
[03:48:45] <Cork> well or columns, depending on how much you shrink it
[03:50:34] <Omar-> kpl data-inline="false" has no effect. It's meant to make input occupy 100% of parent width. it's false by default.
[03:51:04] <hrusti> Cork: but I want to show it but when user click +
[03:51:20] <Cork> clicks what?
[03:51:33] <hrusti> plus icon under row
[03:52:22] <Cork> then you should prob hide the columns instead of killing the scroll
[03:52:45] <Omar-> kpl http://jsbin.com/vobegadabi
[03:53:00] <kpl> Omar: In my jqm app, I added jquery.mobile.datepicker.theme.css, and this made the calendar non-transparent, but still there are 2 problems: 1) the drop down calendar appears behind an <input type="checkbox" />  2) when I touch a date a button behind the calendar is clicked..
[03:53:26] <hrusti> Cork: do you know maybe how? Is there any class to do it? Am I missing sth?
[03:53:43] <Omar-> kpl in that case adjust "z-index" of datepicker
[03:53:44] <Cork> hrusti: data table might have something
[03:53:49] <Cork> i don't know the plugin enough to tell
[03:53:59] <Omar-> although I guess it has high z-index value
[03:54:34] <hrusti> Cork: k
[03:55:02] <Omar-> kpl https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-datepicker-wrapper/issues/9
[03:56:14] <cambazz> hello, there is a comment form, and when user clicks and types something i want to make an ajax call to see if user is logged in
[03:56:28] <cambazz> how can i trigger something when user clicks and input field
[03:56:31] <kpl> Omar-: Thanks, i didn't see that link
[03:56:40] <Omar-> np :)
[03:57:14] <Omar-> cambazz trigger something like what? an event? $("element").trigger("event")
[03:57:48] <Omar-> sorry, I didn't see your previous comment
[03:58:04] <Omar-> use keypress/keydown/keyup events
[04:07:30] <BinaryKitten> Omar- would recommend the input event over the keypress/keyup/down event
[04:08:41] <BinaryKitten> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[04:14:11] <hellier> If I do $('dd').each(... how could I grab the first 'dt' element above the current dd?
[04:14:38] <Cork> $(this).prevAll('dt').first()
[04:14:49] <Cork> or just prev() if it is always the previous element
[04:14:56] <hellier> ah thanks
[04:15:12] <hellier> there may be dd's before it, so I think your first way is best
[04:15:27] <kpl> Is jq-ui in general compatible with jq mobile? datepicker has a "mobile wrapper". What about the other "widgets" and functions?
[04:15:55] <Cork> kpl: it would be the other way around if anything
[04:16:03] <Cork> but not sure
[04:17:44] <kpl> I asked that way because jqm seems like dealing with pages, views, etc., so jq-ui widgets could be considered something you put "inside" jqm
[04:18:15] <Cork> kpl: jqui is for a much bigger audience then jqm
[04:18:35] <Cork> so everyone of them would have to carry around a compatibility solution for jqm
[04:18:56] <Cork> and that doesn't really make sense
[04:19:09] <Cork> jqui isn't really meant for mobile at all btw
[04:20:42] <kpl> Right. Anyway, to use the jqm wrapper for datepicker I included jq-ui-1.11.2.min.js (i.e. all of it and not just the datepicker file), and so far does not seem to cause trouble, even when I have kendo-ui widgets as well in there..
[04:21:40] <Cork> kpl: sure, i jqui is quite compatible out of the box, i just meant they don't have any special compatibility code for jqm
[04:22:03] <Cork> for example ajax loading most likely will break the widgets, unless you "create them" the right way
[04:27:58] <Chulbul> When ajax is fired, suppose it takes 2 minutes to load data from jquery ajax and at the same time when I enter some other url on browser window, it doesn't redirect to that url until ajax request gets compeleted although faded loading of browser can be seen. Any idea why is this happening?
[04:28:31] <Cork> Chulbul: the ajax call is sync
[04:28:37] <Cork> make is async
[04:32:09] <Chulbul> actually its multiple ajax calls , until it reach at some predefined value like 6 ajax calls one after another .. so i need to set async: true ??
[04:32:41] <Cork> you need make it not block the code
[04:32:51] <Cork> if you don't have async: false today it is async by default
[04:32:57] <Cork> and it is something else blocking the reload
[04:33:08] <Cork> async ajax call doesn't block
[04:36:33] <Chulbul> ok, async isn't inside the code .. its a function -> loadData(){ ajax called and on success again called loadData() with different params untill 6 calls } I think somethings wrong with this ..
[04:37:15] <Cork> hmm doesn't sound like that should cause a block
[04:39:12] <Chulbul> ok, thanks anyways :)
[04:53:29] <WebDevB> Hey guys, anyone around?
[04:53:50] <Elirips> Hello. Do I need a special jQuery for mobile devices, or will 2.1.3 also do all its magic on an iphone/ipad/android/what-ever-else-exists ?
[04:55:57] <AdamPDotty> there is a jquery-mobile. We use it for prefetching pages, special event handlers and more. Not sure whether you can do the same without.
[04:56:28] <WebDevB> Hey guys, I'm setting a select option based on data returned by an AJAx lookup...
[04:57:24] <WebDevB> The problem is in the select list is say 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 - if my jquery returns 14 it will pick 1.
[04:57:39] <WebDevB> is there away around this, this is my code: $('#validate3').val(response['dvla_makeid'][0]);
[04:57:53] <prohobo> the [0]
[04:58:11] <prohobo> seems like it could be the reason it's only returning the first digit
[04:59:25] <Cork> Elirips: jquery works on all fairly modern browsers
[04:59:27] <Cork> mobile or not
[04:59:51] <Cork> it doesn't include any ui details though, you might want to get something for that
[05:00:03] <Cork> and jquery-ui isn't built with mobile in mind
[05:00:46] <Elirips> Cork: thank you. Dont care about the ui stuff, its more about the events and selectors
[05:00:57] <Cork> WebDevB: like prohobo said, dvla_makeid is most likely a string
[05:01:27] <WebDevB> Yea that's worked... problem is sometimes it's a sting and sometimes it's an object
[05:01:28] <WebDevB> haha
[05:01:29] <WebDevB> Joy
[05:07:38] <Germanaz0> Hello, I have an ajax login form, but I don't have autocomplete there, I would like to make they autocompleted
[05:10:53] <Cork> Germanaz0: ok?
[05:11:13] <Germanaz0> ok what ?
[05:11:22] <Cork> what is the question?
[05:11:36] <Cork> you made a statement, and i'm wondering what the question is
[05:11:42] <Germanaz0> how to make an ajax form, to remember the fields that were submited
[05:11:55] <Cork> depends on the browser
[05:12:05] <Germanaz0> isn't there any trigger ?
[05:12:05] <Cork> but as long as you don't bind click on a button
[05:12:13] <Cork> but use the submit event on a form
[05:12:19] <Cork> most modern browsers save the form info
[05:12:28] <Germanaz0> hmm
[05:12:29] <Cork> (never use click for forms, use submit)
[05:12:41] <Germanaz0> nice one, I will review it
[05:13:26] <Cork> and there isn't a solution for he ones don't, except not using ajax
[05:15:27] <Germanaz0> yes I'm using an input type submit
[05:15:42] <Cork> no not typ submit
[05:16:11] <Cork> i mean $('form').on('submit', func); instead of $('input[type="submit"]').on('click', func)
[05:16:27] <Cork> the later kills all the browsers form handling
[05:16:49] <Cork> (same if you don't wrap the fields in a form tag, even if you don't set an action on it)
[05:16:53] <Germanaz0> hmm I'm using knockout to bind the submit form
[05:17:12] <Germanaz0> I'm not binding any event to the click button
[05:17:21] <Germanaz0> the input type submit just submit the form normally
[05:17:33] <Cork> so you're not using ajax?
[05:17:36] <Germanaz0> and knockout binds the form submit event to do the ajax
[05:17:55] <Cork> then the fields should be saved by the browser
[05:18:06] <Germanaz0> is not happening :(
[05:18:27] <Cork> in what browser?
[05:19:45] <Germanaz0> chrome at least
[05:19:47] <Germanaz0> and FF also
[05:20:28] <Cork> hmm
[05:20:35] <Cork> interesting chrome doesn't do it
[05:20:37] <Cork> but ff works fine
[05:20:47] <Cork> though chrome fixed that a bit back...
[05:20:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ba2fc5rp/
[05:21:05] <Cork> ie works too :)
[05:21:15] <Cork> well ie10+ at least
[05:24:13] <Germanaz0> let me check
[05:24:36] <morfin> hmmm
[05:24:56] <Germanaz0> is not autocompling
[05:25:00] <Germanaz0> *autocompleting
[05:25:17] <Cork> auto completing only works if you have values saved for the form
[05:26:27] <Germanaz0> and is there any way to manually save those values ?
[05:26:33] <Cork> no
[05:26:42] <Cork> not in the browser at lest
[05:42:21] <Elirips> Is there an alternative to on('load') that also works on i-devices? I need to known when an iframe has finished loading..
[05:45:10] <prohobo> my god
[05:46:29] <prohobo> can someone explain to me why this json object's value is being cut off at the double quotes? https://dpaste.de/MTVM
[05:46:42] <prohobo> value returns "assign where host.display_name == "
[05:46:58] <prohobo> instead of "assign where host.display_name == "butt""
[05:48:01] <curiousmansi> i am using the autocomplete jquery ui widget the extra thing i have to do is add the clear icon , on click of that it clears the input box and then it should display all the menu items
[05:48:38] <curiousmansi> but i could only clear by setting the value to "empty"  how i can trigger the autosearch function
[05:48:50] <curiousmansi> as it is not listing the list for me now
[06:05:03] <Silmarilion> is there a ready function for jquery plugins? I want to call the plugin when its loaded?
[06:05:39] <Cork> Silmarilion: plugins should (if built correctly) be loaded before .ready is called
[06:05:49] <Cork> so that shouldn't be a problem
[06:06:11] <Cork> unless you use a third party lib to ajax load the libraries (ex through require.js)
[06:11:14] <curiousmansi> http://jsbin.com/waciga/3/edit
[06:11:32] <curiousmansi> anyone can help me show the list on pressing clear button
[06:14:15] <Cork> "the list"?
[06:14:54] <Cork> you mean you want to trigger showing the autocomplete when the button is clicked?
[06:15:36] <hellier> Is the difference between an object and array, is that an object can have anything as a keyname, whilst array is limited to a numeric order?
[06:15:55] <mooncup> hellier: ish
[06:16:08] <mooncup> you can do other things with an object tho
[06:16:55] <hellier> i see
[06:16:56] <Cork> hellier: yes, and that an array always starts at 0
[06:17:26] <Cork> meaning var a = []; a[15] = 1: a.length == 16
[06:18:02] <hellier> I see, makes sense.
[06:19:04] <hellier> I wish JS would be more forgiving them creating objects and arrays, having to create them before setting is quite annoying. Coming from another language. At least with PHP I can tell it to piss off with the errors. ;p
[06:19:21] <hellier> warnings rather
[06:19:30] <Cork> hellier: php is horrible when it comes to this though
[06:19:30] <hellier> forgiving when creating*
[06:19:40] <Cork> most other languages works like how js works
[06:19:51] <Cork> though es6 adds a lot of nice things to objects
[06:19:59] <Cork> like dynamic key names
[06:20:12] <hellier> I dunno about that, I like how PHP does it. It cuts down on a lot of unnecessary code.
[06:20:38] <Cork> user="hello";  var o = { [user]: "world" }; o === { hello: "world" }
[06:21:11] <Cork> hellier: not really
[06:21:19] <Cork> not if you know how to handle it correctly
[06:29:23] <daem_> 	hey, could anyone help me with this one: http://pastebin.com/RDHnD03U the click always get the wrong div id (#hidden-1057 instead of the clicked one) and I have no idea why
[06:30:08] <Cork> daem_: don't bind click handlers in a loop
[06:30:16] <Cork> use delegate instead
[06:30:59] <daem_> thx will try
[06:31:49] <daem_> btw why does it end up using the last item of the loop?
[06:36:41] <daem_> all i want to achieve is to have the right id in alert(hiddenDiv); but no luck so far
[06:38:59] <anli> Is there some way of doing a jquery animation where the underlying timeout/interval is ticking faster so the animation is smoother?
[06:41:20] <themojowill> howdy all
[06:42:36] <wheeei> whats the difference with .filter and .find?  For example $(".tour").filter(".on-sale").addClass("highlight");   vs      $(".tour").find(".on-sale").addClass("highlight");
[06:43:29] <qwertytech> Has anyone worked with JSONP and cross domain?  I'm getting an error message in IE9 and lower.
[06:44:08] <BillCriswell> wheeei: filter filters out a collection, find gets a collection.
[06:45:34] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  and in real world examples, when do I use one and when do I use the other?        I use both to target something specific within another selector?
[06:46:31] <BillCriswell> I use filter when I need to narrow a collection down and find when I want to find elements in that collection.
[06:46:35] <curiousmansi> how to perform a search whenever you want like on clear press on load of autocomplete
[06:47:54] <BillCriswell> wheeei: When you do $('.tour').filter('.on-sale') That'll narrow down so only elements with both of those classes are present.
[06:48:01] <BillCriswell> <div class="tour on-sale">
[06:48:18] <logikos> if i have a $(selection).clone() and i wanted to (for a moment) treat it as a string and replace a substring with something, then append the resulting string/markup to another element ... how might i do that?
[06:48:26] <BillCriswell> $('.tour').find('.on-sale') will find <div class="tour"><div class="on-sale">this</div></div>
[06:49:07] <BillCriswell> wheeei: So .filter doesn't look at the elements you're filtering on's children.
[06:49:25] <lajuin> what is the difference between $('.tour').filter('.on-sale') and $('.tour .on-sale') ?
[06:50:18] <BillCriswell> lajuin: $('.tour').filter('.on-sale') would actually do the same as .tour.on-sale
[06:50:54] <BillCriswell> .tour .on-sale (notice the space) would look for .on-sale inside .tour elements.
[06:50:54] <lajuin> ah clever, ty
[06:51:29] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:53:28] <lajuin> is there a time when you'd use filter over just $('.tour.on-sale')? or is it just preference?
[06:53:58] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  $('.tour').find('.on-sale') will find <div class="tour"><div class="on-sale">this</div></div>            really??  That surprises me a lot... so $("#idofaUL").find("li");   will that return the WHOLE UL with <ul></ul> ???
[06:54:32] <wheeei> if the ul is <ul id="idofaUL"><li></li></ul>
[06:58:28] <daem_> Cork: i just cant get it work. the console log hidden div part is ok, but in the alert its always the last item. how does delegate solve it? http://pastebin.com/RDHnD03U
[06:59:09] <Cork> daem_: again, don't bind click in a loop
[06:59:13] <Cork> use delegate
[06:59:18] <Cork> ?api delegate
[06:59:18] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:00:16] <Cork> daem_: also note for doesn't create a scope, so $element becomes the last element in the loop so you will have code errors from that
[07:00:35] <Cork> but, you really should solve this in a clean way instead
[07:00:36] <lajuin> delete() or on() ?
[07:00:39] <lajuin> delegate*
[07:00:50] <Cork> i always point new users to delegate
[07:01:00] <Cork> cause that page explains how delegate works
[07:01:07] <logikos> i made an demo to help explain my question here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EavERM  I am wanting to replace the substring %n with an inc'd number when clicking add
[07:01:07] <Cork> while if you don't know what it is you do bind with on
[07:01:15] <daem_> ok maybe im just using delegate wrong
[07:01:26] <logikos> how might i do that please?
[07:01:45] <Cork> daem_: line 29
[07:01:52] <Cork> it should not be there
[07:02:04] <Cork> same with 23-25
[07:03:08] <Cork> daem_: am i guessing correct and you're working with an svg file?
[07:03:15] <curiousmansi> how i can show the menu of autocomplete as it loads
[07:03:48] <daem_> Cork: url at the top of the pastebin (i really appreciate your help, thx)

[07:04:47] <Cork> ?mdn string.replace
[07:04:49] <b-ot> Cork: String.prototype.replace() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[07:04:52] <Cork> logikos: ^
[07:05:05] <Cork> that is basically all you have at you're disposal
[07:05:15] <logikos> ty, will read
[07:05:17] <Cork> js doesn't have a printf like solution
[07:05:23] <Cork> well yet at least
[07:06:08] <logikos> Cork i know how .replace() works with regex and that will be fine, but i'm starting with a jquery dom element...
[07:06:28] <logikos> so dont i somehow need to convert that to a string or something?
[07:06:30] <Cork> logikos: it isn't an element its the content of an attribute
[07:06:32] <logikos> before doing replace()
[07:07:03] <logikos> so you mean target the content of each attribute specificly
[07:07:10] <Cork> $('input').val($('input').val().replace())
[07:07:23] <Cork> (you want to write a cleaner selector) but that is basically how it work
[07:07:55] <logikos> i see

[07:09:16] <anli> Why is the end of the notify slideup on http://jsfiddle.net/jxdjq4gb/4/ instant?
[07:09:28] <anli> (ctNotify)
[07:10:35] <Cork> anli: cause it doesn't animate padding
[07:10:39] <qwertytech> IE8 and 9 are both throwing a generic error of error when my jquery code runs.  No other browser throws this.  Yesterday someone told me it was because my site (http) is calling the data from (https).  Why is it only IE that gives this retarded error?
[07:11:06] <Cork> you pro want to wrapp the element in an extra element with no margin,border or padding
[07:11:22] <anli> Cork: So the plugin writer did not do a good job then?
[07:11:52] <Cork> anli: it most likely just use slideUp and it has the same "problem"
[07:12:12] <anli> I try to rewrite it a bit
[07:12:40] <anli> Another problem is that if I am picking a faster slideup speed, around 500 instead of 2000, the slide granularity seems a bit too big
[07:12:45] <anli> So the slideup will not feel smooth
[07:13:07] <Cork> ya, i would prob just use css3 instead
[07:13:13] <anli> Ah, ok
[07:13:13] <Cork> well not prob, i would :D
[07:13:16] <anli> hehe
[07:13:22] <Cork> i never animate with js anymore if possible to do in css
[07:13:38] <anli> I will try that
[07:13:46] <anli> Will it animate padding as well?
[07:14:16] <Cork> the biggest difference is that css3 transision can't animate dynamic height (height: auto)
[07:14:26] <anli> Ah, ok
[07:14:26] <Cork> so you have to have a fixed height
[07:14:37] <Cork> what properties gets animated is up to you
[07:14:38] <anli> I will actually use fixed height on this div, so its ok
[07:14:46] <Cork> you would have to animate them by specifying them in the css
[07:14:52] <anli> I will probably wrap it anyway
[07:15:00] <Cork> ?mdn transition
[07:15:01] <b-ot> Cork: transition - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
[07:15:32] <qwertytech> I'll just head over to the jquery forums to get help.
[07:18:05] <BillCriswell> wheeei: $("#idofaUL").find("li"); just returns the <li>s inside of #idofaUL
[07:19:59] <buzzlewoo> yo
[07:20:07] <BillCriswell> $('#idofaUL') is just a reference to the ul, it doesn't really keep track of the li's inside it.
[07:20:43] <logikos> Cork, this is a better representation of what i'm trying to do: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yyoKGx - and it helps to better explain why i might desire to treat the element and contents as a string to use .replace() on the markup
[07:21:00] <coachz> hi
[07:21:09] <logikos> the substring to replace could exist in various and multipal locations
[07:21:34] <coachz> Is there an easy way without a plugin to detect OS and Browser versions ?  I'm in jQuery 2
[07:21:36] <daem_> Cork: yes svg. http://bit.ly/1LloETr if I use delegate, just nothing happens.. maybe im just too newbie for this :/
[07:21:40] <Cork> logikos: look into a template engine like jqote2 or underscore or mustach
[07:21:49] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[07:21:55] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code → http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[07:21:57] <logikos> perhaps $(innerHTML().replace()) might convert to string, replace, and then convert back to dom element
[07:22:18] <Cork> logikos: it shouldn't be elements to start with
[07:22:31] <Cork> you should keep it as text and run it through a template engine
[07:22:43] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  $('.tour').find('.on-sale') will find <div class="tour"><div class="on-sale">this</div></div>         And then you say    $("#idofaUL").find("li"); just returns the <li>s inside of #idofaUL          Now I'm confused...
[07:22:50] <logikos> it is being run though a server side template engin before it even gets to the client lol
[07:23:10] <Cork> logikos: well what you're doing is what template engines are for
[07:23:17] <Cork> so you want another one
[07:23:23] <Cork> .replace works for simple things
[07:23:24] <BillCriswell> wheeei: I put "this" in there to say this element, but it needed some context...
[07:23:40] <Cork> your example exceeds where you should look into a real template engine
[07:24:01] <wheeei> so you mean it will only find the content and not the whole div?
[07:24:20] <logikos> alright, i'll look into client side template engines
[07:26:29] <BillCriswell> wheeei: We should start over.
[07:27:04] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  yeah I will write a html-pastie
[07:27:13] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[07:27:50] <bbclover> hey guys I have this list of java objects that I want to I guess make an ajax call to populate a html <select> dropdown, is that the right terminology?
[07:28:32] <BillCriswell> You have an array of objects that you want to populate a <select> with?
[07:28:42] <bbclover> yeah
[07:28:47] <kpl> In http://api.jquerymobile.com/checkboxradio/ I can't see which function to use to set/get the checked status. In debugger I can see class ui-checkbox-off/on and data-cacheval="true"/"false".
[07:29:04] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Ok cool glad I could help!
[07:29:17] <bbclover> I mean is ajax the way to go?
[07:29:21] <bbclover> I'm trying to model it
[07:30:05] <bbclover> I suppose I'd need another ajax call when I select one of the entries to tell what object I selected
[07:30:23] <BillCriswell> bbclover: It depends on so many things.
[07:30:35] <bbclover> can you tell me them
[07:31:01] <anli> Will a css transition happen if I foo.remove()?
[07:31:10] <BillCriswell> I'd only use ajax to populate a select if I had to do a lot of things depending on different variables. Just loading a select via ajax for the hell of it seems like overkill.
[07:31:39] <BillCriswell> anli: No.
[07:31:43] <bbclover> BillCriswell: all right, how would I do it then?
[07:31:45] <anli> ok
[07:32:47] <BillCriswell> bbclover: I'd just put them in statically if things aren't changing.
[07:33:05] <bbclover> so this list is populated from records in a database table
[07:33:09] <bbclover> so they're gonna be changing
[07:33:23] <bbclover> that's why I thought the ajax call would be appropriate because I could fetch the latest set each time
[07:33:56] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Are you using php or something server side? You can build the html there.
[07:34:05] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  I got it now !! =) .find is for the child elements within the selected element and .filter for the same element thats getting selected
[07:34:06] <bbclover> I'm using java
[07:34:13] <BillCriswell> wheeei: Right.
[07:34:18] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[07:34:42] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  thanx for the help :)
[07:34:44] <bbclover> so I have my markup which is html, I got java in the background, and I figured I'd make an ajax call to fill that dropdown
[07:34:54] <coachz> Is it possible to detect the OS and Browser versions in jQuery or JS ?
[07:34:55] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Well loop through it and build the html.
[07:35:14] <coachz> googling makes it look hopeless
[07:35:18] <bbclover> well I have to get it to the frontend in some javascript variable right?
[07:35:19] <BillCriswell> coachz: The navigator variable should have it in there somewhere.
[07:35:23] <bbclover> then I can loop through it
[07:35:25] <Cork> coachz: not to some degree, though jquery doesn't provide any help
[07:35:34] <Cork> coachz: you have to sniff the useragent
[07:35:37] <coachz> it just has Linuxx86_64 for example
[07:35:40] <Cork> and it is far from perfect
[07:35:43] <coachz> that doesnt' tell me it's Centos 6.6
[07:35:47] <coachz> or whatever
[07:35:52] <Cork> ah, there is no way to know that
[07:36:01] <coachz> oh dear
[07:36:06] <coachz> how about browser version
[07:36:49] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You can loop through it anywhere you want.
[07:37:08] <Cork> coachz: what exist is in the ua
[07:37:17] <coachz> it's a mess
[07:37:19] <Wes-> Does jQuery have any kind of "yes my extensions are loaded" management, or is the right way to depend on jquery-provided-things to wait for the domready event?
[07:37:26] <Cork> coachz: navigator.userAgent
[07:37:41] <Cork> coachz: yes it is, the ua wasn't ever meant to identify the os
[07:37:53] <coachz> userAgent=Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.91 Safari/537.36
[07:38:07] <coachz> that doesnt' tell me if they are in Chrome or Safari
[07:38:11] <Cork> that field should (today) be "ie", "chrome", "safari" and "opera" (and so on) nothing else
[07:38:17] <bbclover> BillCriswell: but if I loop through it in java I have to send it to the front end somehow
[07:38:18] <coachz> yeah
[07:38:26] <Cork> coachz: it does
[07:38:31] <BillCriswell> bbclover: How is the rest of your HTML getting to the page though?
[07:38:32] <Cork> you just have to parse the ua correctly
[07:38:49] <coachz> Cork: how do i know if they are in safari or chorme or mozilla
[07:38:56] <bbclover> I wrote the html
[07:38:58] <bbclover> but it's static
[07:39:05] <Cork> coachz: look into ua sniffing
[07:39:07] <bbclover> now I want to add this dropdown using ajax I guess
[07:39:13] <Cork> though i recommend not relying on this
[07:39:19] <bbclover> using the Tim Berners-Lee protocol I suppose
[07:39:45] <coachz> so i can tell my boss there is no way to reliably get the browser version or os and version right ?
[07:39:49] <Wes-> bbclover: jquery has support for xhr which you could use to retrieve the data from your server
[07:40:32] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Ok.
[07:41:18] <coachz> is that correct ?
[07:41:22] <bbclover> man getting data from servers is so hard
[07:41:42] <coachz> that's why you make the big bucks
[07:42:08] <bbclover> I'm so poor
[07:42:18] <bbclover> I drive a 2006 camry
[07:42:23] <bbclover> it's not bad
[07:42:25] <bbclover> but I can't pay it off
[07:42:26] <coachz> raise your rates
[07:42:34] <coachz> work 1000 hrs a week
[07:42:43] <bbclover> I would if someone would let me
[07:42:48] <bbclover> they just cut u off at 40 hours
[07:46:16] <coachz> get 2 jobs
[07:46:22] <coachz> or 3
[07:52:39] <kpl> Howto set/get "checked" for mobile Checkboxradio widget?

[08:16:42] <daem_> weh im still stucked with this, all i need is the right div id in the alert(hiddenDiv), no luck with .delegate instead of .bind could anyone pls help me out? desc. and url at the top of paste http://pastebin.com/RDHnD03U
[08:39:11] <RavinduL> Hi! Is there any way to detect a :before element click in jQuery?
[08:39:35] <lstude> I'm trying to grab the URL of each button on a carousel slider and then apply that URL to a background image (so users can click the background image and be directed to the same place as the button). I can get the URLs, but am not sure how to bind each to the slide it correlates to in the carousel: http://codepen.io/lstude/pen/WbEjKw
[09:08:40] <ZionZee> hi anyone here?
[09:10:50] <ZionZee> i would like to ask http://jsbin.com/gucanaloyo/1/edit for this query function how do i stop from displaying all questions when there is blank field in search text box?
[09:11:59] <arthurvr> you mean, if the search box is blank, you don’t want to do the ajax call?
[09:12:56] <ZionZee> yup, or when the search box is blank, i don't want see any search results
[09:14:26] <arthurvr> just add an if-statement I’d say
[09:15:55] <ZionZee> arthurvr: can show some code example?
[09:15:57] <arthurvr> ZionZee: something like if($.trim($(search).val()).length) {}
[09:16:13] <arthurvr> where you of course will need to replace the selector
[09:16:43] <arthurvr> ZionZee: http://jsbin.com/kiwucekefe/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:16:50] <ZionZee> arthurvr: is it possible to show me the full working code if possible
[09:17:04] <arthurvr> oops should be http://jsbin.com/qiraxadite/1/edit
[09:17:39] <arthurvr> ZionZee: you’re example isn’t working in jsbin anyhow :)
[09:22:08] <ZionZee> arthurvr: lol after applying your code it is not working now..
[09:22:30] <arthurvr> you used that last fiddle I posted?
[09:22:40] <arthurvr> (I was pasting the wrong one the first time)
[09:23:10] <arthurvr> Please make your jsbin complete btw
[09:23:19] <arthurvr> this isn’t going to work there anyhow
[09:28:26] <ZionZee> arthurvr: i have paste the working code, it works for me in the template
[09:28:43] <ZionZee> arthurvr: btw if using if else statement, wad will be like?
[09:29:33] <OnceMe> Does jQuery already have Comet object?
[09:29:42] <OnceMe> because I rewritted ajax polling to comet
[09:29:49] <OnceMe> so I dont kill my server with requests
[09:33:15] <OnceMe> anyone?
[09:37:09] <arthurvr> Hi ZionZee, I’m back - sorry for the delay!
[09:37:35] <arthurvr> ZionZee: What I mean is that the ajax calls just timeout in jsbin
[09:38:23] <arthurvr> ZionZee: I just used the shorter or operator ”||” in here. You can perfectly use it for this kind of things.
[09:38:31] <arthurvr> ZionZee: But if-else is possible too
[09:39:03] <Mastema> this is so annoying. This shouldn't be so hard =/... I just want a div centered between 4 fixed divs surrounding it. The top div and bottom div can horizontally scroll if window goes below 800px. Can't get it to work across all browsers for the life of me
[09:40:32] <ZionZee> arthurvr: ok becuz now whenever i enter space or a alphabet "a" into the search box it will show all the hundreds of question in database
[09:41:21] <ZionZee> arthurvr: can i set like if there is no character get rid of the drop down search?
[09:41:30] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Spaces aren’t a probem anymore, that’s why I used `.trim()`
[09:42:12] <arthurvr> ZionZee: If you input characters it makes the call, that’s the expected bahaviour right?
[09:42:21] <ZionZee> yup
[09:42:24] <arthurvr> ZionZee: what drop down search?
[09:42:44] <ZionZee> arthurvr: i mean it will appear a list of result like autocomplete
[09:42:58] <OnceMe> Does jQuery already have Comet object?
[09:43:17] <ZionZee> right now even i never type anything, it still have all the questions in database appear
[09:46:06] <arthurvr> ZionZee: why would you like to get rid of it?
[09:46:17] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Are you using some plugin or native one?
[09:46:22] <ZionZee> nope
[09:46:36] <arthurvr> none?
[09:46:59] <arthurvr> ZionZee: using the native one it just won’t appear when the box is empty
[09:47:10] <Mastema> can someone tell me a better way of doing this with it being browser compatible? http://jsfiddle.net/27zjtfk4/18/
[09:47:11] <arthurvr> ZionZee: And if it isn’t empty, it’s a good thing to have
[09:47:35] <ZionZee> arthurvr: i mean now when I enter spacebar, it appear all the questions
[09:48:05] <ZionZee> arthurvr: when i remove the spacebar the long list of questions still appear there
[09:48:20] <arthurvr> please complete your bin using some sample data - that would make things clear. Also, that’s because you gave it that list. Nothing to do with jQuery or that snippet you gave
[09:49:18] <arthurvr> ZionZee: normally autocompletion dissapears when nothing is entered. But a space actually is something. It’s a native behaviour so I’d suggest not to manipulate that
[09:49:48] <arthurvr> ZionZee: You could turn it off totally from the if-statement but I’d suggest to not do so
[09:50:28] <arthurvr> Using the `autocomplete` attr you can turn it off (temporary or not)
[09:51:20] <OnceMe> can someone please help me with this ajax/comet http://pastebin.com/ruvs3uqA ?
[09:51:32] <OnceMe> its working, however it's making connections to live.php all the time
[09:51:41] <OnceMe> like 4000 connections in 2seconds
[09:51:46] <OnceMe> like its in infinite loop
[09:52:45] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe in your connect, you call connect....
[09:53:03] <robertmaxrees> line 21 - that's your problem.
[09:53:18] <OnceMe> oh ok
[09:53:28] <robertmaxrees> you're calling connect when you successfully connect
[09:53:36] <OnceMe> so after I remove that Ill get connection refresh when php output something more than 0?
[09:53:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:53:47] <robertmaxrees> what, exactly, are you trying to do?
[09:54:11] <OnceMe> well ok
[09:54:25] <OnceMe> I'm trying to make ajax comet which will update my notification
[09:54:44] <OnceMe> on default /ajax/live.php?get=number is 0 if there is no notifications
[09:54:46] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to do long polling with a push?
[09:54:49] <OnceMe> and so it goes up when notifications come
[09:54:54] <OnceMe> yes
[09:55:18] <OnceMe> I want to script make a persistent connection and wait for event change to occur and then to reconnect
[09:55:28] <robertmaxrees> http://www.screenr.com/SNH
[09:55:33] <OnceMe> thats the point of comet right? so I get real time data with no kill of performance
[09:55:39] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, sort of.
[09:55:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do comet though.
[09:56:25] <ZionZee> arthurvr: ok if want to stop the scipt? what should i do ?
[09:56:29] <OnceMe> in that tutorial when I get new notifcation
[09:56:33] <OnceMe> will I get instantly notice
[09:56:41] <OnceMe> or will wait for script to hit server in 15seconds?
[09:56:41] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe you'll have to try.
[09:56:42] <wheeei> BillCriswell, haha now I found a new one that I really can't see any difference with.  .siblings and .filter
[09:57:04] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing now is a bad idea, and realtime streaming like this is kind of hard to get right, especially in a performant way.
[09:57:19] <robertmaxrees> is PHP your backend, OnceMe?
[09:57:34] <BillCriswell> wheeei: siblings() returns the siblings. .filter filters out the collection.
[09:57:37] <OnceMe> yes
[09:57:54] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be pretty difficult, then.  you need to search around on how to do that.
[09:58:03] <arthurvr> ZionZee: what do you mean with ”stop the script”? Block the native autocomplete from appearing?
[09:58:09] <robertmaxrees> it's not as simple as firing ajax requests repeatedly.
[09:58:39] <ZionZee> arthurvr: ok i know what's wrong already..
[09:59:14] <wheeei> BillCriswell,  http://jsfiddle.net/3t7k1dzd/          selecting exactly the same items though don't they?
[09:59:32] <ZionZee> arthurvr: becuz i use html to show the result... that's why is static
[09:59:59] <ZionZee> arthurvr: the result is appear there forever unless i do a refresh
[10:00:24] <ZionZee> arthurvr: ok so how to i show the result thru a list using query?
[10:00:50] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Jsfiddle/bin please
[10:01:41] <wheeei> BillCriswell, forget about it, I just realized the difference and updated the fiddle :)
[10:02:17] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[10:03:36] <ZionZee> arthurvr: http://jsbin.com/vanayiwevo/1/edit
[10:04:09] <arthurvr> ZionZee: that’s a paste of your code, not a working testcase
[10:06:44] <ZionZee> arthurvr: but in order for it to work i need pump in database..
[10:07:07] <arthurvr> no just get in some sample data for us to fiddle with
[10:09:30] <ZionZee> arthurvr: how to create one more html file?
[10:10:01] <arthurvr> is that needed? Try to keep your testcase focussed on the thing you’re trying to show us
[10:11:27] <ZionZee> arthurvr: yes, otherwise i cannot insert data
[10:12:36] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Can’t you insert those manually? Must be possible if the question is front end focussed?
[10:15:31] <ZionZee> arthurvr: http://jsbin.com/vanayiwevo/1/edit?html,js,output ok u go take a look,
[10:18:03] <arthurvr> so what you mean is that you’d like to include the li’s returning and squash them into the <ul>?
[10:18:06] <arthurvr> ZionZee: ^^
[10:18:22] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Well then I’d suggest to use .load and save yourself some pain
[10:18:47] <arthurvr> ZionZee: Also why not to insert them directly in there?
[10:19:23] <ZionZee> arthurvr: now i want show the list of result using interactive javascript than static html list
[10:19:42] <ZionZee> arthurvr: now i want show the list of result using interactive i mean jquery than static html list
[10:19:58] <ZionZee> arthurvr: is that possible?
[10:20:01] <arthurvr> what do you want to do in that ”interactive jquery”?
[10:20:18] <arthurvr> Just take the items and put them into the list elem?
[10:21:47] <ZionZee> arthurvr: i have told u that if i list them on html, even the search box becomes empty, the list is still there because list html is static
[10:21:58] <ZionZee> arthurvr: u get what I mean?
[10:24:47] <arthurvr> ZionZee: If I understand you correctly - which I might not - you can just use .load
[10:24:51] <arthurvr> `api load
[10:24:51] <b-ot> arthurvr: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:25:23] <Gmac_> if a script is inside a element with display none will the script still run?
[10:25:44] <arthurvr> Gmac_: yes
[10:26:12] <Gmac_> even if that script is a google analytics?
[10:26:26] <Gmac_> unfortunatley i cannot put it in the header
[10:26:28] <robertmaxrees> why would that change anything?
[10:26:49] <Gmac_> i dunno the robot maybe doesnt view elements that are hidden
[10:26:54] <arthurvr> Yes it will. It’s just js
[10:27:02] <robertmaxrees> the only thing that MIGHT impact is whether or not the browser is able to use what GA is trying to do for analytics.
[10:27:10] <robertmaxrees> some setups inject an image into the page.
[10:27:29] <robertmaxrees> a "tracking pixel" - i wonder if some browser simply don't load it if it's display: none;
[10:27:44] <arthurvr> I believe it’s still loaded tho
[10:27:55] <arthurvr> so don’t get why that won’t work.
[10:27:58] <arthurvr> let me try.
[10:28:14] <robertmaxrees> you'll have a lot of browsers to check fwiw
[10:28:36] <arthurvr> true. but I’m interested in this stuff.
[10:29:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd be interested to see what you find :)
[10:29:36] <Gmac_> let me know if it doesnt wokr
[10:29:37] <Gmac_> work
[10:29:43] <arthurvr> testcase is already here: http://www.w3.org/2009/03/image-display-none/test.php
[10:30:14] <arthurvr> seems mixed browser per browser
[10:30:15] <robertmaxrees> wow
[10:30:19] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[10:30:51] <arthurvr> most do - but still not best practice
[10:30:56] <arthurvr> ~most don't
[10:35:55] <alexclark> I have a problem with the swiper plugin, on mobile all the images stack up until I do the first swipe
[10:46:21] <bbclover> hey guys if I have a json array called json (received from a http get request), how do I iterate through it and you know, do stuff
[10:46:45] <arthurvr> bbclover: I’ll fiddle something together for you
[10:46:54] <bbclover> thanks!
[10:48:53] <pantsofchocolate> hello jquery peeps, random question. So I have a plus/minus at the bottom of my page that adds more fields to a form. Basically whats the best way to check the last visible field and whether or not it has a value to prevent the user hitting minus and hiding the field?
[10:49:28] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate on click of the thing, check .last().val().length
[10:49:57] <robertmaxrees> if (!$('form input').last().val().length) { e.preventDefault() }
[10:51:17] <pantsofchocolate> hmm alright that might be the best way to go about it thanks
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll need to build up a validator.
[10:53:35] <arthurvr> bbclover: just a quick example: http://jsbin.com/wobifavufo/1/edit?js,output
[10:53:58] <arthurvr> bbclover: fetches from an API, iterates over everything, generates <ul> with that data
[10:54:57] <bbclover> arthurvr: isn't this like some cross url thing violation
[10:55:13] <robertmaxrees> only if the other side says so.,
[10:55:19] <Gmac_> i tried outputting google analytics through my cms but i get an error on webkit xss error wont allow the script to load
[10:55:25] <arthurvr> bbclover: depends on server-side setup
[10:56:10] <arthurvr> bbclover: This is the github api, so doesn’t complain about it
[10:57:15] <ZionZee> arthurvr: I think never mind, can you teach me how to create a autocomplete search in query?
[10:57:31] <robertmaxrees> isn't that what he was just doing?
[10:57:49] <bbclover> arthurvr: so what's the function(i, commit) { ? what's i and commit is each element of the json array you're iterating over?
[10:58:12] <arthurvr> i is the index in that array, and that last thing is totally true.
[10:58:28] <bbclover> and commitElem automatically closes the <li> you create?
[10:58:41] <bbclover> or does that happen when you do append
[10:58:43] <arthurvr> yes
[10:58:49] <arthurvr> to that first thing :)
[10:58:58] <arthurvr> it’s element creation syntax
[10:58:59] <bbclover> thanks a lot, I'm gonna try it out right now
[10:59:00] <robertmaxrees> $('<li>') self-closes the tag for you.
[10:59:11] <robertmaxrees> because jquery is nice for you.
[10:59:35] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: who uses closing li tags man?
[10:59:48] <bbclover> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TTPQCPA6I/AAAAAAAACwA/ZHZH-Bi8OmI/s400/ALOT2.png
[10:59:52] <arthurvr> they’re not needed :)
[10:59:53] <Uhkis> jquery, just like veggies
[10:59:59] <arthurvr> bbclover: haha
[11:00:03] <robertmaxrees> depending on my mood, I self-close.
[11:00:09] <robertmaxrees> not always.
[11:00:09] <arthurvr> lol =)
[11:00:30] <arthurvr> I like to not close as much as possible (when it stays readable/well-working)
[11:00:31] <robertmaxrees> i was raised in the world of XML, so it "looks better"
[11:00:35] <arthurvr> but that’s probably just me
[11:00:42] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: my god :)
[11:00:59] <robertmaxrees> nah plenty of people prefer it.  i can deal without as long as the whitespace is good.
[11:01:06] <ZionZee> arthurvr: I think never mind, can you teach me how to create a autocomplete search in query?
[11:01:20] <ntcbow> is not closing li tags "semantically correct"?
[11:01:37] <arthurvr> ntcbow: yes, but why do so if the browser does it for you?
[11:01:49] <robertmaxrees> depends on the context.
[11:01:50] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li
[11:01:56] <robertmaxrees> check out the "tag omission"
[11:01:57] <ntcbow> the browser does many things
[11:02:12] <robertmaxrees> it can be semantically correct and valid markup so long as you follow the rules.
[11:02:26] <robertmaxrees> i prefer to be explicit and close tags.  you don't always have to do it though.
[11:02:44] <arthurvr> ya that behaviour is specced.
[11:02:51] <arthurvr> but it’s a personal opinion at the end
[11:02:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:04:51] <arthurvr> ZionZee: why not to use native power? http://jsbin.com/duqafudonu/1/edit
[11:05:03] <arthurvr> ZionZee: You can drop in everything you want
[11:05:16] <arthurvr> ZionZee: still don’t exactly get your question tho
[11:05:37] <Mastema> I have some jquery code that works fine in firefox but breaks in ie, can someone help me out?
[11:05:47] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr that doesn't work in all browsers\
[11:05:53] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Mastema
[11:05:53] <b-ot> Mastema: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:05:56] <PlantAlchemy> hi, omEONE plEASE HELP ME
[11:06:12] <wheeei> BillCriswell, sorry to bother you again... I'm going through the learn.jquery.com  and in the example they use $(this).closest(".tour").find(".photos")    I find it overly complicated when you can just use      $(this).siblings(".photos")     Is there any reason they do it more complicated than necessary?
[11:06:23] <arthurvr> PlantAlchemy: feel free to ask :)
[11:06:34] <robertmaxrees> wheeei that's easy :)
[11:06:46] <hlvwrk> PlantAlchemy I LikE THe WAy U WORD
[11:06:53] <PlantAlchemy> suddenly every page on my site displays this error msg http://plant-alchemy.com/about for e.g.
[11:07:05] <robertmaxrees> wheeei what happens if you change the markup around and they're no longer siblings?
[11:07:09] <Mastema> http://pastebin.com/suVvBv7J this is my code... it scrolls the right amount in firefox, even after resizing etc... but in IE it doesn't scroll far enough to the right
[11:07:14] <arthurvr> PlantAlchemy: let me take a look
[11:07:16] <PlantAlchemy> do you know how I can stop this happening?
[11:07:36] <arthurvr> PlantAlchemy: you mean the alert?
[11:07:42] <PlantAlchemy> ya
[11:07:54] <arthurvr> it’s because you use a version of jQuery not compatible with some plugin you use
[11:08:08] <arthurvr> tho plugins throwing errors in alert? nah. Let’s dump that plugin :)
[11:08:17] <PlantAlchemy> so how do I update it?
[11:08:28] <robertmaxrees> Mastema without seeing this in action it's real hard to understand what's broken.
[11:08:58] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/27zjtfk4/23/
[11:09:05] <wheeei> robertmaxrees, hm okay... guess it depends on the site and circumstances. I doubt the markup would change in their example...          But siblings should be a quicker way
[11:09:06] <Mastema> that's essentially what im trying to do
[11:09:10] <arthurvr> PlantAlchemy: do you want to update it? It means dropping browser support. Also, I would just find a replacement for that plugin, come-on
[11:09:16] <Mastema> it works in firefox but not in IE
[11:09:18] <robertmaxrees> wheeei in the real world, it changes all the time.
[11:09:22] <PlantAlchemy> or can you tell me which plugin pls?
[11:09:35] <Mastema> yoiu need to shrink the frame down and try using the horizontal scroll
[11:09:35] <robertmaxrees> wheeei maybe not on the example site, but elsewhere it does.
[11:09:45] <wheeei> robertmaxrees, not on my sites ;>
[11:09:57] <robertmaxrees> we actually have it as almost policy at my job to do .cloest() and .find(), instead of .siblings()
[11:10:01] <ntcbow> robertmaxrees i'm creating a chrome-plugin and its communicating with my webserver, guess what, "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present", it's like at least once a week that i run into that cors bs and i even found a way to reply with the original origin instead of just *
[11:10:30] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow you can do a wildcard on your box.
[11:10:34] <wheeei> robertmaxrees, really? okay I will stick to it then as a policy for myself...
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> wheeei it's up to you, but if you're working on a lot of widgets and modules and things, it can be really helpful.  it decouples things for you nicely.  do what works best for you though.
[11:11:24] <robertmaxrees> if you prefer .siblings(), use it :)
[11:12:49] <PlantAlchemy> can anyone tell me which is throwing this alert error msg on every page pls (and how to remove/update it PLS/.
[11:13:01] <robertmaxrees> PlantAlchemy it tells you which pluginb in the error.
[11:13:57] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: if you my jsfiddle in firefox and then in IE you'll see the IE one doesn't scroll far enough http://jsfiddle.net/27zjtfk4/23/
[11:14:23] <arthurvr> easyfix : window.alert = function() {} before the plugin code
[11:14:50] <robertmaxrees> Mastema i saw it the first time.  looking.
[11:15:16] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[11:15:42] <arthurvr> PlantAlchemy: it’s jQuery blockUI plugin that’s causing it
[11:15:51] <arthurvr> on line 180
[11:16:02] <robertmaxrees> Mastema i assume you checked to see what widths your elements are at?
[11:18:18] * pothepanda is looking for a good tavern name
[11:19:16] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: how so? any attempt I've tried at checking widths before changing offset hasn't worked for me
[11:19:17] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there's a way to do this in raw CSS>
[11:19:25] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: how so? any attempt I've tried at checking widths before changing offset hasn't worked for me
[11:19:30] <Mastema> oops...
[11:19:56] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: I feel so too x.x... but the googling I did people suggested jquery for horizontal scroll on fixed divs
[11:20:09] <robertmaxrees> why are the header and footer fixed, though?
[11:21:22] <Mastema> I want the panels surrounding the center to always be visible. while scrolling down the page.
[11:21:50] <Mastema> maybe later allowing for scrolling separately on main-panel and other-panel later
[11:22:43] <robertmaxrees> looks like this is one of those things where IE and FF disagree about where the element stops.
[11:22:53] <robertmaxrees> kind of at a loss and i don't have time to dig in atm.
[11:23:22] <Mastema> robertmaxrees, np. thanks anyways
[11:23:40] <robertmaxrees> #css might know.
[11:23:46] <Mastema> ok
[11:41:07] <bbclover> hey guys if I want to append an html dropdown select tag with $("<option value='json.id'>").text(json.name); where json is a json object, is that correct?
[11:41:11] <bbclover> with .name and .id
[11:41:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:41:37] <robertmaxrees> the value will just be that string.
[11:41:40] <robertmaxrees> 'json.id'
[11:41:43] <robertmaxrees> there's a cleaner way - one sec.
[11:42:13] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/u1ibia9/
[11:42:16] <robertmaxrees> do this instead.
[11:43:09] <bbclover> that's great, thanks!
[11:50:27] <baako> so my url in the .get return this {"id":37,"table_no":"23","status":1} but when i do $.get('{{ URL::route("approval-list")}}', function(data) {
[11:50:27] <baako>     $.each(data, function(index) {
[11:50:27] <baako>         var id = this.id;
[11:50:27] <baako>         var status = this.status; i get underfined
[11:50:38] <baako> why is that please
[11:51:51] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that every object has a status?
[11:53:13] <robertmaxrees> wait is data an array or {"id":37,"table_no":"23","status":1} ?
[11:57:27] <baako> robertmaxrees: yes
[11:57:56] <baako> robertmaxrees: before the object used to be like this [{"id":37,"status":1},{"id":38,"status":1},{"id":39,"status":1},{"id":40,"status":1}]
[11:58:12] <robertmaxrees> could you fiddle up an example?
[11:58:20] <baako> but i have made some changes to my php code so it now returns like has shown previously
[11:59:22] <baako> robertmaxrees you know somewhere i can put a add the output in a url?
[11:59:40] <robertmaxrees> don't deal with the ajax part.
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> just the each and your data.
[12:02:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: dont know how to create a jsfiddle for this
[12:03:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0dvv3g86/
[12:04:01] <robertmaxrees> update data with an example of your data.
[12:06:59] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/0dvv3g86/1/
[12:07:10] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:07:28] <robertmaxrees> that's going through ID, then table_no, then status separately.
[12:07:56] <robertmaxrees> when given an object, $.each() goes through every property.
[12:11:11] <baako> robertmaxrees: i got it
[12:11:33] <baako> just need to add [] in my php variable which returns it
[12:11:43] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why?
[12:12:29] <baako> nope
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> $.each(); goes through every property on an object.
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> so before it was trying to go through each part of your object earlier.
[12:13:08] <robertmaxrees> slapping [] around the object makes it into an array with a single thing.
[12:13:16] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need the each if there's only one thing.
[12:27:17] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: Ive noticed some differences in the values in IE and firefox... IE deals in floating point numbers where firefox doesn't...
[12:27:37] <robertmaxrees> go check out the docs for .offset() :)
[12:27:48] <robertmaxrees> iirc they talk about it.
[12:30:23] <Mastema> "Note: jQuery does not support getting the offset coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element."   I see... That's probably the source of my problem which is what I suspected for awhile. I've been rewriting the code to not deal with offset() on the body element anymore.
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> that sounds about right.
[12:31:32] <Shai-Tan> moin
[13:19:29] <royalty> hello is there an easy way to have a div with a click event within a link to take precedence over the link?
[13:20:22] <royalty> <a href="whatever"> <div id="dude" onclick="function"> </div> </a>
[13:20:44] <royalty> of course this is an example and i keep all code in the head of my document
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> sure, though it'd take a little wrangling.
[13:23:58] <royalty> yeah I'm wrangling with it
[13:24:15] <royalty> basically preventing the default
[13:24:54] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got.
[13:25:46] <royalty> https://gist.github.com/Modicrumb/60967a7e0431e18ed511
[13:25:58] <royalty> this is kind of in the middle of it, i am trying to use classes instead
[13:26:05] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:26:09] <royalty> ah sorry I should probably include
[13:26:10] <royalty> the html
[13:26:11] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't show me your html.
[13:26:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> a functioning jksfiddle would be awesome.
[13:27:29] <royalty> alright I'll do that soon
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> because basically http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nLx2fLde/
[13:30:33] <royalty> yeah but in cases
[13:30:40] <royalty> where i don't click target
[13:30:47] <royalty> i still would want the click to go through
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> easy
[13:31:18] <royalty> do it up then
[13:31:20] <royalty> haha
[13:31:32] <robertmaxrees> you can just check the e.target() and go from there.
[13:31:54] <royalty> ahhhh
[13:31:56] <royalty> interesting
[13:32:20] <royalty> so i can check if e.target() has a certain class and all that?
[13:32:26] <royalty> that's pretty sickkkk
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not a function.
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> maybe not the target...
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:32:41] <royalty> ok
[13:33:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nLx2fLde/2/
[13:33:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, like this.
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> e.target()
[13:33:47] <robertmaxrees> err, lol not a function.
[13:34:16] <royalty> ahaha awesome
[13:34:20] <royalty> this is what i was looking for
[13:34:38] <royalty> i was about to toggle classes and stuff and detect changes between them
[13:34:40] <royalty> to try and do it
[13:34:42] <royalty> ughh
[13:34:45] <royalty> thank you sir
[13:35:24] <royalty> so i guess i won't need to make a jsfiddle i would have pretty much replicated yours
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> probably.,
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> unless you have more questions.
[13:35:57] <royalty> haha I think I'll be good going to implement this right now
[13:37:48] <royalty> robertmaxrees, i wonder what kind of cool things you have coded that involved a lot of event hacking
[13:38:05] <robertmaxrees> nothing with hacking.
[13:38:11] <royalty> lol
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> nothing necessarily cool either.
[13:38:20] <robertmaxrees> just about knowing events.
[13:38:25] <royalty> yeah
[13:38:37] <royalty> i wonder what you accomplished since you know them so well
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> the .on() documentation is a great resource.
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> nothing crazy tbh.
[13:39:21] <royalty> awww
[13:39:34] <royalty> do you contribute to open source plug ins or something like that?
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> not code wise.
[13:39:54] <royalty> hmmm alright
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> i wrote the CoC for all the jquery foundation IRC channels.
[13:40:02] <robertmaxrees> i work for a semi-large ecommerce company, so lots of code there.
[13:41:24] <royalty> ahhh I am guessing it is a private proprietary framework your company rolled out
[13:41:33] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily private or anything.
[13:41:36] <royalty> ah
[13:41:54] <robertmaxrees> our internal stuff is all proprietary, the JS is JS - it's available if you look at the page source.
[13:42:10] <royalty> does your company offer ecommerce solutions or do they make money via selling
[13:42:19] <royalty> products on their own site i meant
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> build.com
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> we're one of the largest online retailers of home improvement.
[13:42:35] <royalty> haha
[13:42:41] <royalty> do you work with angular?
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:42:49] <royalty> big companies seem to do that
[13:42:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't like it personally.
[13:43:06] <royalty> looks nice though
[13:43:25] <robertmaxrees> we compete with lowes' and home depot's online stuff.
[13:44:06] <royalty> and i implemented your code successfully, thanks very much
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:45:31] <royalty> may I pm you?
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:21:04] <phelix> I am using .height() on a container. It seems its getting the perfect height on FF but when looking at it on Chrome its off by like 20 pixels or so. Anyone have an idea what might cause this?
[14:24:56] <reynierpm> how do I iterate over this result? data.ent is what you see on this pic http://screencast.com/t/2oDl20Ya but $.each(data.ent, function (index, value) { value.modeloMarcaProducto } gets undefined for example I think I am missing something here but what? what is the right way to iterate trhough data.ent?
[14:36:32] <ntcbow> reynierpm: did you try a some for loop? without jquery?
[14:36:40] <wheeei> is there is a reason to learn stopPropagation() except to know what it does when you see it?    Can it always be replaced for the better practice: preventDefault()?
[14:38:12] <ntcbow> wheei: i had a case where in some cases i wantet the click to be propagated to lower elements and in some others i did not
[14:38:56] <ntcbow> i think preventDefault is something different
[14:39:01] <baako> hi guys how can i make this jquery work effectively plus alittle secure? http://jsfiddle.net/wmk769g1/2/ the only different between the 2 is the button names
[14:41:29] <ntcbow> baako: those yes/no buttons are +/- buttons for the value between them?
[14:44:57] <jakesy> clear
[14:50:20] <baako> ntcbow: not the value is the id
[14:50:52] <baako> ntcbow: but ideally its positive and negative
[14:55:14] <baako> ntcbow or any body : any suggestions?
[14:55:21] <baako> please
[15:00:34] <ntcbow> please what? i see 5 rows of yes|23|no and one with 100 and one 30
[15:00:47] <ntcbow> so yes / no should do what?
[15:01:33] <ntcbow> what does the ajax load?!
[15:02:20] <baako> ntcbow: yes you accept not you denied.  if you accept i post some values to php and then do somethings with it. if not the same thing happens
[15:02:57] <ntcbow> $("#Awaiting").html(data); would replace allmost everything you posted in that fiddle
[15:05:04] <baako> ntcbow: i havent tested that far yet
[15:05:26] <baako> anyways i think they is a way to combine what i am trying to do into one in a secure way
[15:07:49] <ntcbow> puhh sorry, i'm too tired now.. can't follow.. i'll take a bath and go to bed now, really sorry..
[15:08:21] <baako> np
[15:08:24] <baako> see ya
[15:09:46] <ntcbow> bye :)
[15:09:57] <ntcbow> gl
[15:22:59] <baako> hello
[15:23:10] <greengriminal> hey all, so I am have this pretty straight forward example: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bc3861a565f3f941968c the issue is when the page seems to load it instantly throws in the console: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[15:23:30] <greengriminal> I am aware that via SO some people suggest changing the #on() -> #bind().
[15:23:56] <greengriminal> But this is a matter of which jQuery version you are using correct. Either way I tried changing this and it didn't work.
[15:24:55] <robertmaxrees> greengriminal which line do you get the error on?
[15:24:56] <freudsfeud_> good morning, I am using the jquery autocomplete() and the select function does not trigger in IE7, even though I use similar code in 2 other places that work well. Any ideas?
[15:25:04] <freudsfeud_> http://pastebin.com/vnQX6ahE
[15:27:58] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees, so i click on on the line that it's failing on and it points me to this: http://postimg.org/image/4ohhm6zcj/
[15:28:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[15:28:26] <greengriminal> fyi the snippet i provided is being used in a Ruby on Rails application
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that you're loading jquery first?
[15:29:40] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees, so in a RoR application you have a javascript manifest file where you specify the libaries you want to load - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/caa5c1ae0142b86ea7e6
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> make sure jquery loads first.
[15:29:55] <greengriminal> as seen there i load jQuery first and then jQuery-ui
[15:30:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno anything about RoR.
[15:30:50] <robertmaxrees> check the page source.
[15:31:51] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees, ah you're right
[15:31:54] <greengriminal> jQuery isn't loaded first
[15:32:25] <baako> hi guys how can i make this jquery work effectively plus alittle secure? http://jsfiddle.net/wmk769g1/2/ the only different between the 2 is the button names
[15:32:57] <baako> i know they should be a secure way i can put two of them into one seen they are more or less doing the same thing
[15:33:08] <robertmaxrees> baako define "secure"
[15:33:14] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees, here: http://postimg.org/image/5u9mwmmbx/ you can see my snippet above and then under the library is loaded
[15:33:28] <robertmaxrees> greengriminal that's why it's broken.
[15:33:35] <greengriminal> cheers
[15:33:53] <baako> robertmaxrees: well right now i believe someone can just change the url, forcing php to do something it shouldnt
[15:34:08] <robertmaxrees> errr, that's not something you can handle via js.
[15:34:16] <robertmaxrees> your PHP should reject bad requests.
[15:34:21] <baako> right now the only thing making the button different is the name apart from that the value is the same
[15:34:37] <robertmaxrees> so the rest of the logic is identical?
[15:35:12] <baako> robertmaxrees:yes
[15:35:33] <baako> if you click on the yes button i sent a status in the database to yes
[15:35:40] <baako> if you click on no it set its to no
[15:35:56] <baako> so what i found is if i change the url in the broswer
[15:36:04] <baako> no can do what yes does
[15:36:12] <robertmaxrees> baako 'button[name="approved"], button[name="reject"]'
[15:36:12] <baako> and yes and do what no does
[15:36:34] <baako> jsfiddle
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> like this http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wmk769g1/4/
[15:36:57] <robertmaxrees> you can use mutliple selectors there.
[15:37:37] <baako> robertmaxrees: they should be some kind of way i can put some unique thing to set apart the 2 button with the data to php
[15:37:49] <baako> so that way i can do a if and else statement
[15:37:50] <robertmaxrees> that's something you should do with your backend.
[15:38:43] <Robdgreat> my backend is none of your business, tyvm
[15:38:51] <Robdgreat> I mean
[15:38:52] <Robdgreat> hi
[15:38:55] <robertmaxrees> lols
[15:38:56] <baako> robertmaxrees: store the clicked button name ina var?
[15:39:07] <robertmaxrees> baako i'm really confused about what you're talking about now.
[15:42:04] <baako> robertmaxrees: okay will explain. With the example you have in your jsfiddle. If i click on yes it will do the same thing has No and No has yes. so i need to press in a unquie something with the data which will have some value to identify which button was clicked. so in my php i can do something like if($button == 'approved') { //do something } elseif ($button == 'reject') {//do something}
[15:42:42] <robertmaxrees> okay - that's really trivial.  what's confusing about it?
[15:44:28] <baako> robertmaxrees: so in data: { _token: csrf_token, ID: tableID }, how can i add the that something to identify which button is clicked?
[15:44:40] <robertmaxrees> like you added the other ones?
[15:44:43] <baako> e.g. the yes button
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> you've already done this with two other vars, so i'm confused about where you're lost.
[15:46:55] <baako> var button = $(this).(button['name="approved"]');
[15:47:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid thing.
[15:47:21] <robertmaxrees> .prop()
[15:47:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('name') is one way.
[15:47:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wmk769g1/5/
[15:47:49] <robertmaxrees> cleaned up a little, too.
[15:51:32] <baako> robertmaxrees: works for the yes but not the name
[15:51:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:51:50] <robertmaxrees> this is what you wanted.
[15:52:59] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:25:38] <oldma8> hello
[16:26:47] <robertmaxrees> good afternood
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> *afternoon
[16:43:21] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: I almost got my stuff working across all browsers... the thing is... the current way has one problem... if I shrink the browser, scrolling works fine... but if I have it scrolled all the way to the right, then enlarge the browser again, the widths are wrong and the positioning is wrong.
[16:43:37] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're talking about - sorry.
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> i hardly remember what i ate for breakfast, and i eat the same thing every day :)
[16:44:01] <Mastema> robertmaxrees: alls good :P
[18:17:49] <baako> this shit is hard core
[18:18:45] <systemfault> Yeah.... as hardcore as this: http://static.greenweez.com/images/products/49000/600/hochet-ba-ba-rumella.jpg
[18:19:06] <baako> still cant remove all the ids which are not in the array http://kopy.io/qiugw
[18:19:26] <robertmaxrees> you've been given multiple solutions to this problem.
[18:19:31] <robertmaxrees> i've given you two.
[18:19:57] <robertmaxrees> .slideDown() isn't even what you want.
[18:22:41] <baako> .hide() aint doing it too
[18:25:58] <Velveeta> preventDefault *is* something different
[18:27:06] <Velveeta> lovely, i love it when i'm way scrolled back in my buffer and don't realize it, and answer something from 4 hours ago
[18:33:52] <Velveeta> if i'm reading that code sample right, it looks like after the request, you're taking all the returned id's and creating new li's to prepend to #userstatus, and remove every other item, i.e. everything that wasn't just returned in that request?
[18:34:16] <Velveeta> because if that's the case, why not just .empty() the list before you start processing and adding the new nodes?
[18:38:06] <beshoo> hello all , i have this google map jq script , it is simpile and clean , https://spyon.mobi/map.htm but for some thing i dont know it enter some kind of loop which hang my chrome ... the source code is here : http://pastebin.com/Z2ew6Nmy
[18:39:44] <Velveeta> what does your console output look like, are any of those logs repeating themselves?
[18:43:16] <beshoo> hold:
[18:43:32] <beshoo> http://i.imgur.com/V6EzmR4.png
[18:45:38] <beshoo> any idea
[18:47:15] <beshoo> as you can see <Velveeta> , the logs is reach final one which is good , but after that ???  the problem appear\
[18:48:39] <Velveeta> yeah, it looks like it's exiting that function just fine, and the error is coming from something else maybe... do you have breakpoints turned on for uncaught exceptions?
[18:49:06] <beshoo> no
[18:49:12] <Velveeta> it would also be helpful to see this actually in action
[18:49:21] <beshoo> the error come for google map script
[18:49:54] <Velveeta> annnnnnd it looks like i can see it in action
[18:50:23] <beshoo> ?
[18:50:26] <beshoo> did it work on your chrome //?
[18:50:47] <beshoo> did google map opend ?
[18:51:36] <Velveeta> no, i'm getting all of those errors too
[18:52:01] <beshoo> strange
[18:52:10] <Velveeta> it looks like it's caught in a loop of triggering events for bounds changed, positions changed, pixelbounds changed, etc
[18:52:43] <beshoo> yes , and i dont know what i have to do !
[18:53:41] <beshoo> the script is google map ! i barely do understabd jq ,,, goole map script ! no way
[18:53:47] <Snerf> minimized js doesnt make it easy to read
[18:54:23] <Snerf> i've worked a lot with google maps api, but your code is hard to read miminized
[18:54:35] <beshoo>  http://pastebin.com/Z2ew6Nmy
[18:54:41] <beshoo> here is the code
[18:55:27] <beshoo> server do the  miminized action via page speed mod
[18:55:31] <beshoo> not me !
[18:56:06] <Velveeta> yeah, i had to find the T.trigger function in that minified garble and insert a console.log into it and just do a local save of it to get that much data
[18:56:23] <Snerf> ok.. here is a better way to initialize the map - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/event-domListener
[18:56:48] <Snerf> I found that way is most effective, instead of $(window).load(function() {
[18:57:20] <Velveeta> and i try not to document.ready vs window.load anyway, as multiple things can cause window.load to trigger, whereas document.ready is always a onetime deal
[18:57:42] <beshoo> hold
[18:58:05] <Velveeta> and that also brings up the point of why a google maps question is being asked in the jquery channel
[18:58:24] <Snerf> its certainly not jquery, for sure.
[19:02:49] <beshoo> i use jq google map script :)
[19:02:56] <beshoo> $(document).ready(function() { dos not help
[19:07:17] <beshoo> <Snerf> do you used markerClusterer?
[19:07:35] <Snerf> no
[19:10:21] <Mark_2> im trying to make a button that increases ‘2px’ to the current div’s margin-top value, so that when i click on the button, it adds 2px to the top. does anybody know how i can achieve that?
[19:24:03] <Snerf> Mark_2, co change the .css to it
[19:30:00] <Velveeta> beshoo: if you're using a jquery google map script, i'm not seeing it in the snippet you posted, that's just straight up google map object instantiation and api
[19:30:45] <Velveeta> mark_2: what he said... the .css function supports math operators like +=, so you can just do .closest('div').css('margin-top', '+=2px')
[19:31:05] <Mark_2> this works? closest('div').css('margin-top', '+=2px')
[19:31:24] <Velveeta> if you want the closest div to the button, yes, $(this).closest().....
[19:33:38] <Velveeta> now, that would happen every time the button was clicked, so if you only wanted it to happen the first time, you'd want to unbind it during that callback
[19:34:49] <Mark_2> super.
[19:34:51] <Mark_2> it works! thanks.
[19:35:12] <Mark_2> can i ask one more quetion though?
[19:35:33] <Mark_2> how do i make a check button that toggles the function?
[19:36:26] <Velveeta> a check button? as in a button with a checkbox that toggles it with +2 and -2px each time it's clicked?
[19:36:43] <Mark_2> yes. excuse my english.
[19:38:20] <Velveeta> i'd probably do it without a button at all, at least, not a button element.. i'd just make a label with a checkbox inside of it, and style the label to look like a button, and bind up a change event on the checkbox that checks the 'checked' property of the checkbox, and does a +/- 2px operation based on its state
[19:39:12] <Mark_2> for styling purpose?
[19:39:13] <Velveeta> something like: if ($(this).prop('checked')) { modifier = '+'; } else { modifier = '-'; } $(this).closest('div').css(modifier + '=2px');
[19:39:48] <Mark_2> wow, that makes even more complicated.
[19:40:51] <Velveeta> not by much, it's a single if/else statement
[19:43:19] <Mark_2> what i want to do is creating a demo panel that controls the text’s position with somewhat like a remote control like buttons
[19:43:34] <Mark_2> and im already having a hard time looking for up down right left buttons on goggle.
[19:43:45] <Mark_2> sigh
[19:43:52] <Snerf> why not must allowed em to resize/move ?
[19:44:00] <Snerf> must=just
[19:44:13] <Mark_2> sorry i missed your point.
[19:44:29] <Snerf> ya, are you wanting users to move stuff around ?
[19:44:35] <Mark_2> yes lol
[19:44:45] <Snerf> so make it .draggable and .resizable
[19:44:55] <Mark_2> how do i do that?
[19:45:06] <Snerf> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[19:45:13] <Snerf> http://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[19:45:24] <Snerf> lovely little things with Jquery UI
[19:45:36] <Snerf> and yes, you can have both on 1 object
[19:45:41] <Snerf> enjoy :)
[19:46:15] <Mark_2> yeah… but the thing is i can’t save the results in wordpress theme.
[19:46:53] <Velveeta> you keep asking different questions at this point
[19:47:03] <Snerf> of course you can
[19:47:14] <Snerf> Velveeta, yes, he does, doesnt he ;)
[19:47:40] <Mark_2> that was not a question.
[19:47:46] <Mark_2> thanks for the tip anyways.
[19:47:59] <Snerf> but yes, you can Mark_2 , using the .stop event, and the admin ajax it to save
[19:48:01] <Snerf> and VOILA!
[19:48:14] <Mark_2> im not that good, but one day i might try that.
[19:49:50] <Mark_2> this might be irrelevant but is there anyway i can track the current state of the top-margin value?
[19:50:24] <Mark_2> like, i want to know where im at after playing with the right and left button that adds and removes 2px to the div.
[19:51:29] <Velveeta> track it in the code, or just be able to know at a glance?
[19:51:43] <Velveeta> because you can inspect it with your devtools to know at a glance
[19:51:57] <Velveeta> to track it in code, you'd have to store that value off somewhere and adjust it accordingly
[19:52:49] <Mark_2> hmm, sounds complicated.
[20:03:46] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody's night going?
[20:06:04] <Mark_2> morning here.
[20:06:21] <Mark_2> but i have a due date tomorrow.
[20:07:15] <robertmaxrees> school or work?
[20:07:20] <craftbynick> hi guys i can use some help here, I am trying to make certain sections of an image clickable how do i do that?
[20:07:33] <robertmaxrees> craftbynick that's called an image map.
[20:08:11] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: thanks robertmaxrees only thing is I cant find anything where I can code it myself, only automated online tools, could you guide me please?
[20:08:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map
[20:08:47] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: essentially what im trying to do is make certain sections envoke a click event through jQuery
[20:09:12] <robertmaxrees> you can add event listeners to area tags just fine.
[20:09:31] <craftbynick> how do i find actual find the cords?
[20:09:43] <robertmaxrees> an image editor.
[20:09:44] <craftbynick> perhaps i should check for some youtube tuts on maps lol
[20:09:59] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[20:10:27] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty trivial, either way.
[20:10:50] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[20:13:48] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: also robert, one more thing btw, do you know of any pre-created code base out there to replicate the iOS dialog box?  I am trying to create a quick POC thus im asking
[20:14:12] <robertmaxrees> nope, but that should be a quick search
[20:15:22] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: i tried searching for it but couldnt find anything exact, just need to mimic the exact look and feel of the iOS dialog box
[20:16:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at one right now.
[20:16:37] <robertmaxrees> what did you search?
[20:17:53] <craftbynick> robertmaxrees: keyword 'iOS html5 dialog box'
[20:18:10] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery ios dialog box
[20:18:12] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Adapting jQuery UI dialog box for iOS devices - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17765378/adapting-jquery-ui-dialog-box-for-ios-devices
[20:18:21] <robertmaxrees> ffff google.
[20:18:22] <robertmaxrees> http://sourceforge.net/projects/iosdialogbox/
[20:18:34] <craftbynick> i for iOS 8
[20:18:42] <craftbynick> thats the old version
[20:18:54] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[20:19:09] <robertmaxrees> probably have more luck tweaking something than searching for one.
[20:19:10] <craftbynick> yea its soo new nothing out there yet lol
[20:19:29] <craftbynick> example http://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/cannot_join_family_sharing.png
[20:19:38] <robertmaxrees> i doubt that's the case.
[20:19:49] <robertmaxrees> that would be super easy to make yourself.
[20:20:47] <craftbynick> agreed one moment making it right now
[20:21:00] <craftbynick> ill share incase anyone else wants
[20:26:42] <Mark_2> um,
[20:26:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:27:07] <jb0t> if im using a jquery based library, and I want to find the code an event handler is mapped to, is there a way I can get that info from chrome or ff developer tools?
[20:27:12] <Mark_2> does this webpage use toggleclass for its left panel? http://www.pixedelic.com/themes/geode/transparent/
[20:27:19] <Mark_2> or is it something else?
[20:27:33] <jb0t> the callback I guess specifically
[20:27:36] <robertmaxrees> jb0t yes - you can look at the inspector at different event listeners.
[20:27:42] <robertmaxrees> and then get the callbacks from ther.e
[20:28:04] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 the style switcher thing?
[20:28:08] <Mark_2> yeah
[20:28:28] <robertmaxrees> probably something like that with CSS transforms
[20:28:57] <Mark_2> k
[20:29:03] <jb0t> robertmaxrees: i figured it was in there somewhere. just having trouble seeing it.  just a bunch of jquery refs
[20:29:08] <Mark_2> gotta go see you later!
[20:29:25] <robertmaxrees> jb0t let's back up - why are you looking?
[20:30:53] <jb0t> im using a library that doesn't do what i want, so i want to see where it does it's binds so i can come up with a plan for extending or monkey patching. but just as an exercise, rather than going code foward, this approach could be helpful for this and other tasks if i can actually do it
[20:31:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd crack open the source code at that point.
[20:31:28] <robertmaxrees> becuase inspectors may not see everything.
[20:32:02] <jb0t> yeah. i fear it's not reflecting what's in the closure
[20:32:13] <robertmaxrees> that can cause headaches.
[20:57:54] <caper> hello every one
[20:59:44] <robertmaxrees> good evening
[20:59:50] <caper> is there any way to known which is drope or drag and delete in drag drop functionality
[20:59:58] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/wee62noa/11/
[21:00:03] <caper> here my fiddle
[21:00:37] <robertmaxrees> try rephrasing the question?
[21:01:53] <caper> like i drop any thing then i dropp on same thing i want to get the detail of this and nothing
[21:02:07] <caper> use my fiddle
[21:02:48] <robertmaxrees> i can't figure out what you're asking so looking at your fiddle won't do me much good :)
[21:05:12] <caper> wait drag anything menu submenu rip then droped it then one more time drop one more element on it  i want to use actionlistener in my fiddle tha t tell me what is dropped or wher
[21:08:11] <robertmaxrees> which listener?
[21:08:20] <caper> action listener
[21:08:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean event listener?
[21:08:31] <caper> or something like that
[21:08:39] <caper> event listener yes
[21:08:48] <Sanjeev> given <div><sibling1/><sibling2/><sibling3/></div>, how to get to first sibling when I have a $(this) for a sibling3?
[21:09:43] <Sanjeev> i'm looking for something like $(this).sibling().eq[0]
[21:09:56] <robertmaxrees> Sanjeev .eq(0) maybe?
[21:10:01] <robertmaxrees> .siblings().eq(0)
[21:10:03] <Velveeta> you could also try .sibling(':first')
[21:10:15] <robertmaxrees> caper check out the the arguments passed to the droppable callbacks.
[21:10:29] <robertmaxrees> the element will be in one of those.
[21:11:36] <caper> robertmaxrees actually  not familiar with event listener
[21:11:59] <robertmaxrees> caper the .droppable() stuff includes a callback for when things are dropped.
[21:12:04] <robertmaxrees> so you don't need to add anything.
[21:13:25] <Velveeta> http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/
[21:13:35] <Velveeta> and more specifically: http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop
[21:13:42] <robertmaxrees> boom
[21:13:54] <robertmaxrees> if i wasn't in the middle of a super difficult work thing, i woulda dropped into there hahaha
[21:13:57] * Velveeta chestbumps robertmaxrees.
[21:14:31] <robertmaxrees> that was really cheesy
[21:14:40] <Velveeta> i just wrapped up a work thing, adding a bunch of comments to a word doc for one of our high muckeymuck PM people, about a salesforce project
[21:14:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha our PMs hate salesforce.
[21:14:55] <Velveeta> i'm warming up for superbowl, chill bro
[21:14:57] <robertmaxrees> we actually LIKE our PMs
[21:15:01] * Velveeta fistbumps robertmaxrees.
[21:15:09] <robertmaxrees> chillbro swaggins
[21:15:16] <robertmaxrees> C-3PBro
[21:15:23] <robertmaxrees> Han Brolo.  I can keep going.
[21:15:28] <Velveeta> i don't know how our PM's feel about salesforce, but i've only been exposed to it for a handful of weeks, and can't stand it
[21:15:40] <robertmaxrees> you'll learn to seethe with hate.
[21:15:42] <robertmaxrees> it's awful.
[21:15:58] <Velveeta> oh i'm dropping off that project, which is why i had to leave a bunch of notes for whoever picks it up and runs with it :D
[21:16:41] <robertmaxrees> bummer for them.
[21:16:46] <Sanjeev> cheers .siblings().eq(0) worked and .siblings(':first') worked as well
[21:17:06] <Sanjeev> what a great bunch of people
[21:17:09] <Velveeta> i have an idea... let's take standard technologies and write our own visual language, our own controller language, our own data store which is almost-but-not-quite-as-good-as a standard RBDMS, and our own language for querying that also, and we can embed that right into the controller language
[21:17:10] <robertmaxrees> :D
[21:17:19] <Velveeta> it'll be just like foxpro, but better! they got it right, right?!
[21:17:35] <robertmaxrees> lols
[21:17:36] <Velveeta> and we'll call it salesforce
[21:17:46] <robertmaxrees> salesfarce
[21:18:15] <Velveeta> platform as a service can be a great thing, look at something like firebase... but come on people, use standardized fucking technologies
[21:18:22] <robertmaxrees> YES
[21:18:34] <robertmaxrees> even as a consumer salesforce sucked.
[21:19:00] <jb0t> what would the syntax look like to call a method WITH ARGS (sort) from this lib http://www.jquery-bootgrid.com/Documentation#methods  $('#grid-data').bootgrid('reload')  works.. but im confused on how to pass args
[21:20:03] <cjohnson_> often as the second argument to that function
[21:20:55] <cjohnson> the docs you linked to suggests reload has no params
[21:21:07] <jb0t> sort is what i'm after.
[21:21:30] <cjohnson> I see. I'd give .bootgrid('sort', {your:'dict here'}) a try
[21:21:38] <jb0t> yeah, did that. no dice :(
[21:22:05] <cjohnson> lack of examples...boo to these docs
[21:22:07] <jb0t> docs are so terrible.
[21:22:30] <cjohnson> what about
[21:22:37] <cjohnson> .bootgrid().sort({your: 'dict here'})
[21:22:50] <Velveeta> let me take a look at the source and see what it's expecting
[21:23:15] <jb0t> cjohnson: i expect that's the options dict for init. doesn't work btw
[21:23:30] <jb0t> Velveeta: ty.  check line 1709+
[21:23:53] <jb0t> my js is rather weak and this is just a bit beyond where i'm at
[21:24:06] <Velveeta> ahhh, this is written as a plugin vs a jqui widget like i was thinking
[21:24:20] <cjohnson> jb0t: no, it's whatever dict your sort method expects
[21:24:27] <cjohnson> the docs make mention of the param being a dict
[21:24:48] <cjohnson> what do you mean "doesn't work"
[21:24:56] <cjohnson> is it unemployed? ;P
[21:24:58] <cjohnson> I love that one
[21:25:28] <jb0t> cjohnson: right.  i can pass that, and I expect it sets it, but it doesn't trigger the reload of the grid. and when i manually reload it with the method call (not a page refresh )  it doesn't do the sort
[21:25:38] <Velveeta> yeah, the code has a @param entry for it also, which is a dict
[21:25:49] <Velveeta> the question is what keys is it expecting in that dict
[21:26:17] <jb0t> right.  my assumption is the row which is data-column-id
[21:26:28] <cjohnson> why would it do the sort again later?
[21:26:31] <cjohnson> it seems like it's a method
[21:26:34] <cjohnson> something you do once
[21:26:37] <cjohnson> not every time it's reloaded
[21:27:08] <jb0t> correct.  and that's what i'm trying to acheive.  capture the filter/sort options and restore on reload.
[21:27:27] <jb0t> it has methods to initiate the filters and sorts.  but having trouble getting them working
[21:28:04] <jb0t> Velveeta: the examples page has several active grids, you can probably interactively mess with them
[21:28:14] <Velveeta> there we go
[21:28:31] <Velveeta> that'll be easier, because the src doesn't seem to enumerate any specific properties it's expecting
[21:28:48] <jb0t> yeah. cryptic for me as a nublet
[21:32:36] <jb0t> i like how it says 'this method is chainable'  great! if only i could call it  :)
[21:33:08] <Velveeta> ok, in one of the examples, i'm finding this as the value of this.sort: {received: "asc"}
[21:33:34] <Velveeta> so it would seem that the dict you pass to it is the column identifier as the key, and either 'asc' or 'desc' as the value
[21:33:40] <jb0t> yeah.. one of my previous attempts was   $("#grid-data").bootgrid('sort', {'pp_itmdesc':'asc'})
[21:33:43] <jb0t> did not fly
[21:33:57] <Velveeta> do you have a demo somewhere that i can see?
[21:34:32] <jb0t> all local unfortunately. but at this point, i can probably throw something together
[21:37:43] <jb0t> but.. on that examples page.. $('#grid-data-api').bootgrid('reload')   on the data api example
[21:37:51] <jb0t> is basically gonna do exactly the same
[21:38:04] <jb0t> if we try to sort by sender
[21:38:17] <Velveeta> yeah, i'm trying to manually execute it and getting an error
[21:38:23] <Velveeta> undefined is not a function
[21:38:33] <jb0t> same :(
[21:39:11] <jb0t> i tried debugging the plugin section (l1700 ish) where it dispatches the command
[21:39:23] <jb0t> but.. its just amazing how impossible it is to see wtf is going on in there
[21:39:43] <jb0t> meta turtles all the way down
[21:42:01] <jb0t> it only takes one arg "option"  so.. it's gotta be some plain obj structure right?
[21:42:53] <jb0t> like..  $("#grid-data-api").bootgrid({'sort': {'sender':'asc'}})  doesn't error, but has no effect
[21:43:29] <Velveeta> well, it seems to take option as the string of the function it wants to call, then does an array slice to get the args to pass to that function
[21:43:43] <robertmaxrees> aaaah so glad to be done with work for the night
[21:44:20] <jb0t> array slice is one option.. since some funcs  take an array.  sort wants a obj/dict
[21:44:53] <jb0t> *i think*   :)
[21:45:11] <Velveeta> right, sort does want an object, but you have to tell it you're invoking sort first
[21:46:15] <Velveeta> i'm gonna see exactly how it calls its own crap
[21:46:16] <jb0t> yeah. that's how i saw it too.  dispatch to the method via string ... then for args? underpants?
[21:46:21] <Velveeta> this plugin won't get the best of me!
[21:46:28] <jb0t> thats the spirit !
[21:46:48] <Velveeta> it seems to be expecting a format of .bootgrid(funcName, arguments)
[21:47:02] <Velveeta> it only receives the first parameter, and then gets the rest by slicing off the rest of the arguments array
[21:47:08] <Velveeta> but it seems to expect funcName to be a string
[21:48:57] <jb0t> yeah.  so. i guess that first line where it does the slice.. if that's coming up empty on debug, then the it's all fail from there
[21:49:01] <cjohnson> definitely agreed there
[21:49:05] <cjohnson> and this confirms https://github.com/rstaib/jquery-bootgrid/issues/24
[21:49:14] <cjohnson> it will be .bootgrid('sort', options)
[21:49:17] <jb0t> all my attempts fail to get anything outta that slice
[21:49:59] <cjohnson> here we see remove: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25620956/using-jquery-bootgrid-methods
[21:50:16] <cjohnson> check the fiddle
[21:50:25] <cjohnson> so my guess is you're just not passing the right things for sort
[21:50:42] <jb0t> cjohnson: could be :/
[21:50:53] <jb0t> too bad it doesn't give the slightest hint what that should be
[21:50:58] <cjohnson> indeed
[21:51:03] <cjohnson> I can't find a working example with sort
[21:51:05] <cjohnson> only other methods
[21:55:51] <Velveeta> looking at the first example on their site, which initializes with no parameters and calls sortrows, where i have a breakpoint set...
[21:56:18] <Velveeta> this.sort at that point is a similar dict to what i posted earlier, the column identifier (received) and a direction ('desc')
[21:56:29] <Velveeta> so that should be valid
[21:56:39] <jb0t> yeah
[21:56:48] <Velveeta> and the Grid.prototype.sort function takes a dictionary, compares it against the current this.sort, and if they don't match, overwrites this.sort
[21:57:30] <Velveeta> except that when i try to actually call it manually, it doesn't seem to find its prototype.sort function, it finds this.sort instance-level object, and tries to do a .apply on it, and then gets undefined isn't a function
[21:57:54] <Velveeta> there seems to be a bug in that code, wherein they're trying to reference a prototype method that shares a name with an object value on the instance itself
[21:58:07] <Velveeta> so it's grabbing a handle to the object value instead of the prototype reference
[21:58:22] <Velveeta> i'm gonna try something real quick to confirm that
[21:58:38] <jb0t> ty
[22:00:15] <Velveeta> yep, i managed to make it work
[22:01:06] <Velveeta> in the minified code on their demo site, it's trying to execute u[t].apply(u, r)... u is the instance, t is 'sort', and r is the dict i'm passing in as the 2nd parameter
[22:01:29] <Velveeta> u[t] referencing the instance is pulling up the old object that's assigned as the default this.sort dictionary
[22:01:43] <Velveeta> f is the short name given to the Grid constructor itself in the minified code
[22:02:09] <Velveeta> so if i do u[t] = f.prototype.sort, and then let execution continue, it passed my dictionary parameter into the proper sort method and sorts it as it should
[22:02:35] <Velveeta> but without doing that assignment manually, it tries to dereference the this.sort object with .apply, and gets undefined is not a function
[22:02:52] <jb0t> ugh
[22:03:00] <Velveeta> it's because the developer is sharing a name between that prototype method and the instance variable they're using to track the current sort state
[22:03:19] <Velveeta> ugh indeed
[22:03:26] <Velveeta> but you can always submit a pull request to fix it ;)
[22:04:01] <Velveeta> unfortunately, if the dev cares anything about API stability, the sort prototype method needs to maintain its own name, so you'd have to change every single internal reference of this.sort to something like this.sortDict instead
[22:04:30] <Velveeta> although there appear to only be 6 instances of this.sort in the whole plugin
[22:05:38] <jb0t> seems insane to me.
[22:05:43] <Velveeta> yep
[22:06:03] <Velveeta> sometimes when i feel bad about the state of the widgets we develop internally, taking a look under the hood of others makes me feel so much better
[22:06:24] <Velveeta> i know we have some refactoring needs, but holy crap are some of those other solutions a fucking nightmare behind the scenes
[22:06:42] <Velveeta> our grid widget is just such an example
[22:06:52] <jb0t> i've already deployed this. feeling i may have chosen unwisely here :(
[22:06:53] <robertmaxrees> Feeling bad about your internal ones means you're aware that you could do better, which automatically gives you a leg up.
[22:07:10] * Velveeta flashes a thumbs up.
[22:07:43] <Velveeta> jb0t: there aren't a whole lot of options that there that are really viable.. datatables is probably the most popular one, but it has its own issues
[22:07:55] <Velveeta> this one seems decent enough except for that oversight on the sort function
[22:07:59] <jb0t> yeah, i've used it before.  it's pretty beastly
[22:08:04] <Velveeta> you could fix that locally and submit a pull request to the author
[22:08:30] <Velveeta> sometimes i wish i could show off the ones we write, but we still have yet to get approval to open source them
[22:08:45] <jb0t> looking like i'll have to do that.
[22:09:32] <Velveeta> i've submitted a grand total of 1 pull request in my life so far, for open source stuff
[22:09:43] <Velveeta> but that means i'm batting 1000 on getting them accepted :D
[22:09:53] <robertmaxrees> boom
[22:10:00] * jb0t claps
[22:10:47] <jb0t> i have a handful. then there are the django reports. always met with intense skepticism
[22:11:08] <jb0t> uhh..no. it's actually broken.  i swear.
[22:11:11] <Velveeta> mr. irish over there made a request of me to write a polyfill for the control property at one point, which was easy peasy for IE9+, but IE8... damn you IE8... the solution involved some event emissions, and i was never quite happy with it and didn't finish publishing it
[22:12:05] <robertmaxrees> not bad.
[22:12:13] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go spend time with my wife.  enjoy folks.
[22:13:25] <Velveeta> so, uh... how bout dem bears?
[22:13:34] <jb0t> hah. thanks
[22:13:57] <Velveeta> no problemo
[22:14:01] <jb0t> my suffering that obvious eh
[22:14:26] <Velveeta> well, to be fair, that would be a pretty ridiculous amount of debugging to figure out even in an unminified environment
[22:14:53] <Velveeta> that minified one made it harder, but especially if you're not used to js and the prototypal inheritance model, you could have chased that shit for days and not figured out what was going on
[22:15:15] <jb0t> yeah. exactly my failing here
[22:16:11] <jb0t> i could fake it with triggers..
[22:16:16] <jb0t> but. talk about jank
[22:17:25] <jb0t> probably easiest option in addition to filing a ticket
[22:18:20] <Velveeta> i'm guessing that dev doesn't have any unit testing around that thing either, or else this should have been caught.. public methods are kind of a baseline for testing
[22:18:56] <jb0t> seriously. that's what i was thinking. pretty egregious
[22:20:27] <Velveeta> well, there is a test directory
[22:21:36] <Velveeta> and none of them test sort functionality
[22:21:37] <jb0t> looks like only a shell
[22:22:08] <jb0t> 5 tests in internal, which is where it should be
[22:23:32] <Velveeta> right
[22:23:42] <jb0t> unusual for a german :P
[22:24:36] <jb0t> im gonna have to sleep on this. decide what to do tomorrow i suppose
[22:26:57] <Velveeta> i'm testing a fix for it right now
[22:27:05] <jb0t> my saviour
[22:27:40] <jb0t> pull request #2  perhaps! :)
[22:34:06] <Velveeta> yeah, that almost fixes it
[22:34:16] <Velveeta> just gotta get the column header playing nicely too
[22:34:22] <jb0t> awesome!
[22:36:44] <Velveeta> oh god it's so disgusting
[22:37:01] <Velveeta> there's no support for redrawing the table header class outside of a click
[22:37:23] <jb0t> ugh
[22:37:57] <Velveeta> and everytime the redrawTableHeader function is called, they .off() that click handler and .on() it all over again
[22:38:37] <jb0t> smrt
[22:45:25] <jb0t> this lib does some other really annoying things. uses POST for all requests, and for sorting/multisort has a really ..um.. non standard format where it puts values inside keys on the post like... 'sort[sender]': ['asc']
[22:46:03] <jb0t> it's obvious why. but it's still pretty terrible.
[22:46:42] <Velveeta> yeah, there's a pending pull request to fix the request type issue
[22:47:22] <jb0t> hmm how old.
[22:47:32] <jb0t> hopefully not a bad sign
[22:48:03] <jb0t> eh. couple months
[22:51:33] <Velveeta> well, it's almost fixed up i think
[22:51:52] <Velveeta> but this person needs 'use strict' fuh realz
[22:52:19] <Velveeta> passing scope around all over the place to a bunch of random functions, they're not even encapulated under an object for namespacing purposes or anything
[22:52:35] <jb0t> good grief
[22:52:41] <Velveeta> there are modules that aren't actually modules, they're just physically separated files with dependencies on other files, requiring knowledge of those internals
[22:52:48] <Velveeta> it's a mess
[22:53:24] <jb0t> shame. and i'm somewhat invested
[22:53:28] <jb0t> damnit
[22:58:14] <Velveeta> ok, think it's all fixed up now
[22:58:54] <jb0t> sweet!
[23:01:15] <Velveeta> now whether this pull request gets approved in anything under 6 months, that's another story
[23:01:47] <jb0t> won't hold my breath. but i WILL fork
[23:01:50] <Velveeta> and i'm also not sure if it works with multisort functionality or not, i'm not about to go down rabbit hole in this code
[23:02:09] <jb0t> yeah. np.  not using multi anyway
[23:02:34] <jb0t> honestly, if more changes are requested i'm going to advise changed grids
[23:02:42] <jb0t> s/changed/changing
[23:08:12] <jb0t> did you submit it ?
[23:10:44] <Velveeta> just about, was making one more fix
[23:14:53] <Velveeta> there's not even a damn gitignore file for the bower_components directory, come on son!
[23:15:22] <jb0t> gets scarier by the min
[23:17:47] <pras> Hi guys, have a quick question. I am trying to parse a HTML string using jquery - something like - $('<div><img src="foo.png">') and it makes call to fetch png file. How can i prevent that and just get the object and not execute tags within in? My use case is to parse it and identify the data attributes of certain elements and update some and get the string version of it
[23:18:21] <Cork> pras: don't parse the html to dom
[23:18:26] <Cork> that is the only way
[23:18:44] <Velveeta> jb0t: ok, it's pushed up to my own github at this point, so you can fork it from there if you want, the account is Velveeta
[23:18:55] <Velveeta> i'll go ahead and submit it as a pull request to the author and we'll see what happens
[23:18:57] <pras> Cork: sure. But should i do something else? Like how would i detect the nodes and do some updates? Using XML parser?
[23:19:24] <pras> All i want to ultimately work on is string
[23:19:37] <jb0t> you rule! sending pm
[23:20:09] <Velveeta> pras: if you just want to work on the string, then just do a string match against the string... passing it to the query constructor function forces it to create those dom nodes, which in turn try to load the asset
[23:21:06] <Cork> pras: you only have two options, 1. work on it as a string, no dom, or 2. work on it as a dom, where images gets fetched
[23:21:12] <Cork> there is no third option
[23:21:48] <Cork> meaning if you don't want the image fetched, you have to work on the raw html string
[23:23:35] <pras> Cork: Agree. But my question is - is there some way i can do a query like - get me all node as string that has this data attribute?
[23:24:01] <Cork> pras: i just answered that twice
[23:26:00] <pras> Cork: What i am looking for is like browser version of https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio
[23:26:09] <sacho_> hmm
[23:26:16] <sacho_> images get fetched when they're not part of the dom?
[23:26:28] <Cork> yes
[23:26:37] <sacho_> that's annoying
[23:26:44] <Cork> pras: you could check if dom.js is an option
[23:27:00] <Cork> but basically, strings + regex is your option
[23:27:57] <sacho_> pras, why is it a problem that the browser tries to fetch the image?
[23:28:42] <sacho_> pras, what you could do is
[23:28:56] <sacho_> var elems = $(...). elems.find('img').attr('src', '')
[23:29:17] <Cork> sacho_: too late :)
[23:29:31] <sacho_> too late?
[23:29:40] <Cork> $() will trigger the fetch
[23:29:43] <pras> Because, what i would want is to convert the existing HTML text into another format - replacing few HTML nodes into some template
[23:29:55] <Cork> resetting the src in an attr call later won't prevent that
[23:30:20] <Cork> pras: so stop using dom elements
[23:31:12] <sacho_> Cork, no it won't
[23:31:14] <sacho_> http://jsfiddle.net/b28sexsh/
[23:31:42] <sacho_> pras, wat
[23:31:52] <pras> Cork: Okay. So thing is i could do with own regex manipulations and do this job. Wanted to know if there is way in jQuery or any other library to do the HTML parsing job for me instead of me doing the kind-of-dirty regex job!

[23:32:45] <Cork> sacho_: both images cause a network connection
[23:32:52] <Cork> stupid network view...
[23:32:54] <sacho_> what, no they shouldn't
[23:33:04] <sacho_> your browser is bugged =)
[23:33:58] <Cork> GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/b28sexsh/show/bar	Aborted
[23:33:59] <Cork> there
[23:34:09] <Cork> so yes the connection is started and then aborted
[23:34:20] <sacho_> which browser is this
[23:34:23] <Cork> firefox
[23:34:44] <sacho_> well firefox is broken as usual
[23:35:08] <Cork> this isn't broken
[23:35:15] <Cork> it's excepted behavior
[23:35:37] <pras> I am using Chrome
[23:35:57] <Cork> sacho_: when the element is generated the request is made
[23:36:07] <Cork> later when the sec is removed the connection is aborted
[23:36:13] <Cork> this is how most engines work
[23:36:32] <sacho_> which engines are most engines
[23:36:34] <Cork> its how image prefetching works
[23:36:50] <Cork> preesto, khtml, trident and gecko
[23:37:05] <Cork> *presto
[23:37:45] <Cork> not sure if webkit or blink has added some lazy ness to the fetching
[23:37:54] <Cork> to try to optimize things
[23:38:05] <Cork> though i don't get how they get image prefetching to work if they do
[23:38:52] <Cork> could be the network connection keeps the element alive so it lazy loads that way
[23:39:00] <Cork> sounds kinda scary though
[23:39:15] <sacho_> they don't fetch during the goddamn js function
[23:39:21] <sacho_> which is stupid for any other browser
[23:39:56] <Cork> depends if it is multi threaded or not
[23:40:16] <Cork> having js block the network thread sounds kinda sitty
[23:40:20] <Cork> *silly
[23:40:39] <sacho_> ???
[23:40:44] <sacho_> it doesn't block the network thread
[23:40:54] <Cork> it would have to to make what you said work
[23:40:57] <sacho_> no
[23:41:08] <sacho_> you just don't queue the requests until the current js function finishes executing
[23:41:27] <Cork> so you mean js should have an "network request" queue
[23:41:44] <Cork> and not send the queue to the network thread queue until js doesn't do anything?
[23:41:56] <sacho_> until the current function finishes..yes
[23:42:00] <sacho_> that's the sane way to do it
[23:42:28] <Cork> it means you have to double buffer it
[23:42:38] <Cork> and in a long running js thread that can be quite a bit of memory
[23:42:55] <sacho_> ok?
[23:43:06] <sacho_> except not really
[23:43:11] <sacho_> it's the same amount of memory
[23:43:22] <sacho_> except a static overhead
[23:43:24] <Cork> no you would have to duplicate the network queue
[23:43:31] <sacho_> since you *move* things from one queue to the other
[23:43:31] <Cork> so one queue in the network thread
[23:43:35] <Cork> and one for each js thread
[23:43:47] <Cork> the network thread is shared
[23:43:50] <sacho_> yes, for each and every one of the one js threads =)
[23:44:19] <Cork> network threads has a circular queue
[23:44:34] <Cork> and you would have to add a queue in js
[23:44:45] <Cork> then when js is done copy that queue over to the other thread
[23:44:50] <Cork> and release the current queue
[23:44:57] <sacho_> dude, you're saying this as if it is some feat of engineering that would make browsers unworkable
[23:45:28] <sacho_> yet it's already done for a ton of things, e.g. the event queue
[23:45:34] <Cork> no, i say it means the browser would have to waist memory for a situation i don't see a problem with
[23:46:02] <sacho_> you must also not see a problem with html live collections :|
[23:46:04] <Cork> most things is possible, the problem is if the cost is worth the gain
[23:48:37] <Kartagis> good morning
[23:50:44] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[23:51:08] <Kartagis> for my Chrome extension, I'm using something like t.innerHTML += '<tr><td>'+u+'</td><td><a href="'+burl+'">'+bookmark.title.toLocaleLowerCase()+'</a></td></tr>'; in my js file. now, I would like to add a contextual remove link. do you think I should add that to the end of this, or should I add a .show() on mouseover?,
[23:52:12] <Kartagis> the former sounds easier, but I'd like to hear if there is a better/common practice
[23:52:23] <Cork> Kartagis: i would recommend parsing the html to an element and attach event listeners
[23:52:29] <Cork> and then appending those elements to the dom
[23:53:31] <Kartagis> Cork: that is already done
[23:53:41] <Cork> no you inject html into innerHTML
[23:53:56] <Cork> that isn't parsing the html to elements(s)
[23:54:02] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:54:16] <Kartagis> care to give an example?
[23:57:42] <Cork> Kartagis: well as you ask in jquery var dom = $(html); dom.find('target').on(); $(where).after(dom);
[23:58:00] <Cork> or similar solutions in native js
