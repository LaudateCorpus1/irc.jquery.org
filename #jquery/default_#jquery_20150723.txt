[00:00:52] <Uhkis> ?tias
[00:01:06] <Uhkis> oh, bot's dead once again
[00:11:49] <Cork> rkrara: the first one isn't valid
[00:11:56] <Cork> the second and third are the same
[00:12:10] <Cork> to expand it a bit
[00:12:24] <Cork> the difference between $(document.body).html(data) and $("body").html(data)
[00:12:41] <Cork> it $(document.body).html(data) vs $(document.querySelector('body')).html(data)
[00:13:10] <rkrara> you meant this $(document).html(data) is not valid
[00:13:15] <Cork> yes
[00:13:39] <Cork> some browsers might auto correct it to document.body
[00:13:45] <rkrara> thanks, what is the difference between $(document.body).html(data) and $("body").html(data)
[00:13:46] <Cork> but i don't think that is standardized
[00:13:53] <Cork> i just answered that
[00:14:07] <rkrara> thanks
[00:14:22] <Cork> it==is
[00:14:36] <rkrara> I am having problem with dynamically created pages
[00:14:36] <Uhkis> false
[00:14:44] <Cork> heh
[00:15:28] <Cork> rkrara: if you replace the body with the response from ajax you aren't really dynamically doing anything
[00:15:53] <Cork> you just speed normal page loading up by not blowing away the document
[00:15:53] <rkrara> the problem is i append the jquery mobile page code to the body of document but the first page wont show up untill i click on the navbar for its link
[00:16:02] <Cork> ah
[00:16:04] <Cork> jqm
[00:16:12] <Cork> ya, it is a bit screwed up
[00:17:14] <rkrara> yes its jqm with cordova.js with google maps making it difficult to handle
[00:18:32] <rkrara> the cordova.js hijacks pageinit event and only leaves back device ready event
[00:19:05] <rkrara> could you help me with dynamic pages in JQM
[00:19:31] <hellyeah> hey
[00:19:37] <hellyeah> do you know jquery modal window?
[00:20:45] <rkrara> are you askiing me? @hellyeah
[00:22:05] <hellyeah> rkrara:  i heard ui has position:relative  and display:block right
[00:22:19] <hellyeah> i have two pop up boxes and it effect position of other
[00:22:40] <hellyeah> someone suggest to put position:absolute to .ui-dialog
[00:22:46] <rkrara> can you make a jsbin
[00:22:47] <hellyeah> do i also need display:inline
[00:23:07] <rkrara> yes use absolute if you need to position relative to document window
[00:23:15] <mdev> css is tricky
[00:25:06] <hellyeah> rkrara:
[00:26:35] <rkrara> yes?
[00:27:10] <rkrara> I am not sure what are you trying to achieve? what is the problem?
[00:27:16] <rkrara> @hellyeah
[00:32:42] <hellyeah> sorry
[00:32:46] <hellyeah> rkrara:  still there
[00:34:36] <rkrara> yes
[00:35:36] <devt204> hello there, my isotope filter doesn't work, can anyone hel me out
[00:36:00] <hellyeah> if you care to look line 98 and line 328 http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/61/ click animated button then click handimage button and image button on the table and close one of them and open it play with these it will effect other pop up position i put position:absolute and display:inline to avoid that. Because i heard it is position:relative and display:block it is full screen https://jsfiddle.net/dLf2
[00:39:00] <rkrara> @hellyeah something is wrong with the link 1st one I get a failure read icon blinking in the result window and the second link is dead
[00:40:03] <hellyeah> rkrara: sorry i disconnected
[00:40:09] <hellyeah> any though
[00:40:10] <hellyeah> t
[00:40:45] <rkrara> sorry why do you have two jsfiddle link
[00:41:03] <hellyeah> one of them is fullscreen
[00:41:08] <hellyeah> one of them is jsfiddle link
[00:41:19] <hellyeah> i give second link to show result in fullscreen
[00:41:27] <hellyeah> btw do http instead of https
[00:45:51] <hellyeah> rkrara: i guess you dont have an idea do you?

[00:48:36] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:48:40] <ekem> ahh ;)
[00:48:41] <rkrara> i am not an expert though? mind it
[00:48:43] <hellyeah> dont understand why
[00:48:53] <hellyeah> rkrara: i appreciate in anyway

[00:49:14] <hellyeah> try this in firefox check console
[00:49:20] <hellyeah> you will get event is not defined
[00:49:27] <hellyeah> but which event dunno
[00:49:30] <rkrara> thanks, now I need to sort out my stuffs and then I get back
[00:49:40] <hellyeah> i heard function(event) solve the problem
[00:49:54] <hellyeah> but it seem not working
[00:50:09] <hellyeah> take your time rkrara :)
[00:50:27] <zagaza> hi guys
[00:50:36] <zagaza> how can I send a string from one div to another div in the simplest way?
[00:50:40] <hellyeah> ekem: i suppose i.e. is problematic
[00:50:41] <zagaza> say a text field
[00:53:06] <mdev> zagaza depends where it's at
[00:53:08] <ekem> ha, they are all problematic
[00:53:29] <mdev> can $('#a').html($('#b').html());
[00:53:33] <STFUn00b> guys... i know this is not a jquery question. anyhow: does anyone know if safari 6 or later exists for windows?
[00:53:38] <ekem> zagaza, use...
[00:53:42] <ekem> oh mdev got it
[00:53:48] <zagaza> mdev depends where it's at? don't quite follow :)
[00:54:06] <Cork> zagaza: what do you mean "send"?
[00:54:09] <STFUn00b> because fu**ing v5 doesn't have dev tools for ipad/iphone
[00:54:12] <ekem> mdev is saying to take the html of one div and use it as the input for another
[00:54:20] <mdev> like if it's a data or raw html or value, data being like <div id='blah' data-mystring='blah'>
[00:54:42] <mdev> so for mystring you'd use .data('blah'); I get the value I believe
[00:55:09] <Cork> STFUn00b: welcome to the apple ecosystem, you have to use a mac to develop for it
[00:55:11] <ekem> use the field i think
[00:55:11] <mdev> or .data('mystring') rather
[00:55:28] <ekem> STFUn00b, the more we can do to not develop for apple the better ;)
[00:55:46] <mdev> for regular div can use html, like <div id='abc'>string you want</div>
[00:55:56] <STFUn00b> yea
[00:55:57] <STFUn00b> i agree
[00:56:01] <STFUn00b> but i'm at work
[00:56:04] <ekem> heh
[00:56:17] <STFUn00b> and they want me to develop a web app for iphone / ipad
[00:56:19] <STFUn00b> but on windows
[00:56:20] <STFUn00b> lool
[00:56:27] <STFUn00b> fml
[00:56:36] <ekem> http://www.xpadian.com/#pricing ??
[00:56:38] <Uhkis> and they didn't give you a device to test with?
[00:56:39] <Cork> STFUn00b: then you only have two choices, 1. hope it looks ok on iphone/ipad, or 2. get the business to buy a mac
[00:56:47] <Cork> STFUn00b: it is a bit silly, but ya, it is how it is
[00:56:55] <STFUn00b> you don't say :)
[00:57:01] <zagaza> this is what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/n23gycfg/
[00:57:11] <ekem> http://www.zophar.net/apple2.html
[00:57:12] <Cork> we have a single mac here just to be able to access xcode, only to debug i*
[00:57:13] <ekem> ??
[00:57:14] <zagaza> mdev's example didn't work there
[00:57:52] <ekem> well zagaza, try logging some things
[00:57:54] <ekem> and see why
[00:57:58] <ekem> console.log()
[01:00:15] <richardkraaijenh> Hi, I just installed jquery core and ran the jscs syntax checker over the code, is it correct that a lot of the code mismatches the jquery styleguide?
[01:00:19] <zagaza> ekem, what I mean is, if I type something into the first input, I want it to show in the second
[01:01:16] <Cork> richardkraaijenh: the compiled js file isn't what ppl code against
[01:01:42] <Cork> check the git repo if you want to check things like that; though that said, not sure how strict they are about coding style
[01:01:52] <richardkraaijenh> I tested on the files in the src folder in core
[01:01:53] <richardkraaijenh> https://gist.github.com/53163daea52d09940a3a
[01:02:00] <richardkraaijenh> some code matches, some don't
[01:02:38] <richardkraaijenh> I guess they're not as strict to the guide
[01:02:50] <Cork> richardkraaijenh: most projects aren't religious about the coding style
[01:04:31] <mdev> Cork it should be consistant IMHO
[01:04:39] <mdev> makes things much easier/cleaner
[01:05:07] <Cork> mdev: not when it is things like }); vs } );
[01:06:30] <richardkraaijenh> I find linespacings important
[01:06:41] <richardkraaijenh> whitespace is less critical
[01:06:49] <Xatenev> richardkraaijenh:
[01:06:52] <Xatenev> Are u working at owlin.com ?
[01:07:00] <mdev> } ); just looks lazy/sloppy IMHO
[01:07:05] <richardkraaijenh> I founded it, but left it this year
[01:07:10] <richardkraaijenh> Do you know owlin.com?
[01:07:14] <Xatenev> Can i q you?
[01:07:32] <richardkraaijenh> q => question?
[01:07:34] <richardkraaijenh> y
[01:07:37] <Xatenev> query :p
[01:08:40] <runtyrobot> Rookie question; Is it possible to construct a query prior to submitting a form? (not ajax) I have some ordinary selects - which ofcourse will be serialized automatically - but I also have a range selector, which isn't.
[01:08:56] <Xatenev> richardkraaijenh: messaged u in private chat :)
[01:10:07] <mdev> run yes just setup event listener, then cancel when form is submitted
[01:10:15] <mdev> then modify and then send it
[01:10:40] <runtyrobot> It got the preventdefault going on the submit event, but it's the modification I haven't been able to find anything on :)
[01:10:42] <Cork> runtyrobot: use serializeArray
[01:10:50] <Cork> runtyrobot: if you're using ajax that is
[01:10:53] <mdev> $("form").submit(function (e) { e.preventDefault();
[01:10:55] <mdev> ...
[01:10:59] <Cork> else you would have to store the value in a hidden field
[01:11:15] <Cork> the hidden field might be the best option either way
[01:12:34] <runtyrobot> Cork:  I considered that aswell - I think that might be the best solution
[01:12:47] <Cork> it is
[01:15:19] <runtyrobot> I'll see if I can get it to work the way I want.
[01:15:21] <runtyrobot> cheers
[01:20:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:21:34] <runtyrobot> Cork: Got it working - cheers :)
[01:23:35] <hellyeah> hey
[01:23:45] <hellyeah> which font do you think is better for dialog window
[01:36:55] <devt204> hey there can anyone help me get the isotope filter working
[01:40:44] <prohobo> isotope is broken like the back of christopher reeves
[01:44:56] <devt204> lol here is the link though http://mmanya.com/shop/drinks/
[01:46:56] <hellyeah> hey
[01:47:01] <prohobo>     “It’s solitary drinking that makes drunkards.”
[01:47:03] <prohobo>     Nathanael West, Miss Lonelyhearts
[01:47:16] <prohobo> just lost a customer!
[01:47:35] <prohobo> sorry devt204 really, i gave up on isotope and use masonry now
[01:47:40] <prohobo> so i dont know much about the filtering
[01:47:49] <hellyeah> in line 90 and 92 maxWidth and minHeight didnt work can you help me find the reason "why" http://jsfiddle.net/Lg574gvr/
[01:48:24] <hellyeah> kindly ask for help pls
[01:48:48] <firefire> Hi. If i bind a click event with $('.configurator_steps').on('click', '.choose_blank', function(ev) {}); how can i unbind this later in another function?? $('.configurator_steps .choose_blank‘).off() or unbind() doesnt work
[01:49:33] <Uhkis> firefire: $('.choose_blank').off('click'); doesnt work?
[01:49:54] <prohobo> hellyeah: maxWidth/minHeight take integers as values not strings
[01:50:04] <hellyeah> damn
[01:50:14] <hellyeah> really
[01:50:14] <hellyeah> :D
[01:51:02] <Cork> firefire:  $('.configurator_steps').off('click', '.choose_blank') is what you want
[01:51:04] <devt204> prohobo thank you though for taking a look :)
[01:52:24] <firefire> Cork: thanks, it works. but is it possible to leave the event.preventDefault(); or does i have to set a new .on() ?
[01:52:52] <Cork> firefire: if you want to keep the function of the event handler, then you shouldn't remove it
[01:53:04] <Cork> firefire: set a value you can check in the event handler instead
[01:53:22] <firefire> ok thank you
[01:54:36] <firefire> $('.configurator_steps').on('click', '.choose_blank', function(ev) is it possible to define here to selectors ? e.g. on(‚click‘, ‚.choose_blank, .select2, select3‘, function() ??
[01:57:25] <Cork> firefire: sure
[01:57:29] <Cork> its a normal selector
[01:57:40] <firefire> ok, thank you very much, you are great supporters!
[01:57:48] <devt204> Cork anything on this http://mmanya.com/shop/drinks/  isotope filter is not working :(
[01:57:59] <Cork> never ever used isotope
[02:20:43] <PCatinean> What is the best way to check if a js hash/dictionary has a list at a certain location, if so then add a element to it, if not create the list and add the element
[02:20:44] <PCatinean> ?
[02:21:56] <Cork> PCatinean: js doesn't have hashes or dictionaries are you talking about objects?
[02:22:03] <Cork> or something else?
[02:22:10] <Cork> also an object doesn't have a position
[02:22:30] <PCatinean> {'1': 'a'}
[02:22:31] <PCatinean> :))
[02:22:39] <Cork> that would be an object
[02:22:49] <PCatinean> if {} has a list at '1' then add to it if not create and then add to it
[02:23:01] <Cork> "a list"
[02:23:04] <Cork> you mean a string?
[02:23:08] <PCatinean> and javascript {} are also objects? with the key/value pair?
[02:23:13] <PCatinean> [1, 2, 3, 4]
[02:23:15] <Cork> yes
[02:23:17] <PCatinean> I come from python sorry
[02:23:23] <Cork> ...
[02:23:26] <PCatinean> what?
[02:23:37] <Cork> so you have { '1': [1,2,3,4] }; ?
[02:23:43] <PCatinean> allegedly, it starts empty
[02:23:44] <medfly> hello
[02:23:58] <Cork> PCatinean: also are you sure you don't just want an array there?
[02:24:05] <PCatinean> if it does not have '1' then create it with
[02:24:08] <Cork> '1' makes me suspissus
[02:24:24] <PCatinean> It's sent via Json and there are multiple values
[02:24:39] <Cork> [null, [1,2,3,4]]
[02:24:49] <PCatinean> simple inputs such as select go {'select_field': id} and checkboxes go {'checkbox_input': [list of ids]}
[02:24:52] <Cork> would be the same as the object
[02:24:55] <Cork> ...
[02:25:05] <Cork> ok that's enough playing around
[02:25:07] <PCatinean> I need key-value pairs
[02:25:10] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with the question
[02:25:18] <Cork> showing the data and what you want to do with it
[02:25:40] <lalalaaa> Hi! Trying to recreate a function which wraps strings in multiple paragraphs depending on their newlines, similar to Rails' simple_format helper (http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper/simple_format).
[02:25:44] <lalalaaa> http://jsfiddle.net/rtg562d3/1/ -- does anybody know why it creates two newlines between each paragraph though? It's not that big of a deal, it just seems unnecessary.
[02:25:56] <Cork> PCatinean: this trickling in with the relevant data and wrong naming everythings makes it close to impossible to answer the question
[02:27:30] <dimi1947> I want to trigger the error callback deliberately of an ajax request...so I can test something...what could I do in a situation liket this?
[02:28:32] <Cork> lalalaaa: why not just why not just ('<p>' + text.split('\n\n').join('</p><p>') + '</p>').split('\n').join('<br>')
[02:29:13] <Cork> dimi1947: define the function externally and call it
[02:29:21] <Cork> or give $.ajax an invalid url
[02:29:44] <dimi1947> this is what I was thinking...give an invalid URL
[02:30:17] <lalalaaa> Cork: hmmm
[02:30:18] <Cork> dimi1947: though it will only trigger one of the kind of errors that results in the error callback
[02:30:36] <Cork> dimi1947: a better option is normally to just config a test server to test it realistically
[02:30:47] <medfly> hi
[02:31:26] <Cork> lalalaaa: http://jsfiddle.net/rtg562d3/2/
[02:33:10] <lalalaaa> Cork: thats a very cool and simplified solution indeed ;)
[02:33:11] <Cork> lalalaaa: or http://jsfiddle.net/rtg562d3/3/ if you prefer
[02:33:47] <lalalaaa> great! thanks =)
[02:34:18] <dimi1947> I am using Apache
[02:34:41] <Cork> dimi1947: so just write a text.php that returns the different states you want to check
[02:35:20] <dimi1947> remember yesterday cork that how I could inform the admin about the error?
[02:35:29] <dimi1947> asked
[02:35:35] <PCatinean> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/m2arv7uf/
[02:38:15] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jsfiddle.net/m2arv7uf/1/
[02:42:13] <PCatinean> just found serialize
[02:42:42] <PCatinean> thank you
[02:43:28] <PCatinean> Cork, does that take only the "checked" values?
[02:43:34] <PCatinean> checked/selected
[02:43:49] <Cork> yes
[02:44:06] <Cork> it does what a form does in a normal piost
[02:44:08] <Cork> *post
[02:44:43] <Cork> PCatinean: if you want to include values for unchecked add a <input type="hidden" name="same as checkbox" value="0">
[02:44:52] <Cork> just before the checkbox
[02:45:24] <PCatinean> hmmm, interesting
[02:45:48] <PCatinean> and if I only want to limit the addition of elements with just a specific class then it gets tricky
[02:46:17] <Cork> PCatinean: not really $('.special-class').serialize()
[02:46:42] <PCatinean> also submit button should not be included and this is not for a replacement post
[02:46:46] <Cork> PCatinean: though you should just have the other fields disabled or without a name
[02:47:02] <Cork> PCatinean: it should still be a form submitted
[02:47:14] <Cork> it is quite important to make the browser know what happens
[02:47:24] <Cork> else you will have a broken experience for the user
[02:48:37] <PCatinean> Cork, this is a multi-step form in which different fields are provided on different pages. The backend keeps a record of the values submitted at each step and when on a particular step the user changes something on the form and the entire form is sent to the backend
[02:49:00] <PCatinean> The backend makes a update of the values sent over the original values and depending on this return data that restricts options on the current page
[02:49:10] <Cork> PCatinean: so just set the elements from the other steps as disabled
[02:49:19] <Cork> and enable them all for when you want to submit it all
[02:49:22] <PCatinean> the other steps are on another page not being rendered
[02:49:32] <Cork> uh
[02:49:37] <Cork> then what is the problem?
[02:49:45] <Cork> if they aren't on the page they won't be submitted
[02:50:23] <PCatinean> Basically what I want is when any value is changed on the form it sends all the data (check/unchecked) to the backend and the backend decides what to restrict on the current form
[02:50:37] <Cork> ya
[02:50:45] <PCatinean> Return available values and JS sets hide to unavailable values and deselects them if they are selected
[02:50:48] <Cork> and the unchecked, but webstandard is a hidden field in the form
[02:50:49] <PCatinean> that's pretty much it
[02:51:13] <Cork> ya, and when you hide them you set them to disabled
[02:51:23] <Cork> and it won't be included in the next submission
[02:51:47] <PCatinean> I guess I can also do that but since they are deselected they will not submit values any way
[02:52:12] <Cork> well don't forget the browsers auto fill
[02:52:21] <PCatinean> The only thing is that this should be a "easy to extend" module and enforcing people to add the hidden field might be a bit of an issue
[02:52:24] <Cork> it might remember the users selection from a different load
[02:52:32] <PCatinean> hmm, that is actually a very good point
[02:52:48] <Cork> PCatinean: not really, cause really, this is how webforms work
[02:52:49] <PCatinean> so I will do element.addClass('hidden').prop('disabled', true)
[02:53:01] <Cork> instead of teaching them how your system works
[02:53:08] <Cork> you just teach them how to create a web form
[02:53:57] <PCatinean> also true yes
[02:54:15] <PCatinean> but either way reinventing the wheel was pretty stupid with serialize available
[02:54:15] <zagaza> hmm.. I am wondering how to affect only 1 input at a time.. because if you press validate on one input.. it disables both.. what would be the simplest way to target only "this" .form-wrapper children?
[02:54:18] <zagaza> http://jsfiddle.net/SDHNY/684/
[02:55:11] <Cork> zagaza: $(this).prevAll('input')
[02:55:23] <Cork> zagaza: also DON'T attr for state changes
[02:55:27] <Cork> use prop
[02:55:35] <Cork> actually you should very rarely use attr at all
[02:55:41] <zagaza> oh? ok thanks
[02:55:57] <Cork> upps *DON'T use attr*
[02:56:28] <Cork> zagaza: attr would be attr('disabled', '') and removeAttr('disabled') btw
[02:56:37] <Cork> only prop takes true/false
[02:56:47] <Cork> but attr disabled isn't cross browser
[02:56:57] <zagaza> Cork: that prevAll thing doesn't seem to work for me? http://jsfiddle.net/SDHNY/685/
[02:57:24] <Cork> you changed input to button
[02:57:32] <Cork> and, ya the button doesn't have a button before it
[02:57:34] <Cork> only an input
[02:58:28] <Cork> zagaza: http://jsfiddle.net/SDHNY/686/
[03:00:02] <zagaza> Cork, I want to keep the input, but change the validate button to an X and only disable "this" input
[03:00:46] <Cork> that would be http://jsfiddle.net/SDHNY/687/ then
[03:01:17] <zagaza> ah thanks!
[03:25:54] <kokut> Hi, there is something extremely weird going on, for some reason when i click on a fancybox link the first time it opens the correct image but the second time it opens the current page in the popup, whats going on?
[03:26:51] <lalalaaa> kokut: how would we know? please see https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[03:28:43] <kokut> lalalaaa: its probably fancybox fault, someone thought it was a smart move to have it render the website inside the popup for some reason
[03:29:15] <lalalaaa> aha i see
[03:29:17] <mdev> kokut that's a legit feature
[03:29:20] <mdev> how would you use it?
[03:29:28] <mdev> iframe is easy way to show some stuff
[03:29:53] <lalalaaa> i need my stuff to be 100% mobile compatible to i use jquery mobile's lightbox (http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/popup/)
[03:30:23] <lalalaaa> * so i use
[03:30:34] <lalalaaa> kind of a bitch to customize but..
[03:31:15] <kokut> mdev: its opening the whole freaknig page inside the popup, all the code except the hml tag...
[03:31:30] <kokut> its not even a 404 page so idk what in the world is going on
[03:36:06] <kokut> well, i fixed it with the content option
[03:37:47] <mdev> kokut yeah fancybox supports iframe
[03:37:53] <mdev> I use that all the time, is useful IMHO
[03:43:37] <ismithers> Evening kids
[03:49:33] <ismithers> I have a jquery carousel, during panel transitions it collapses briefly which results in a page position change. What is the best way to fix that?
[03:49:58] <ismithers> (For instance, I can specify a set height, which stops it of course. But that creates real headaches for any sort of liquid layout/responsiveness)
[03:59:34] <lemonsparrow> I do if(element.is("button")) to check if element is button or not but I get the error Uncaught TypeError: i.is is not a function
[04:00:32] <Uhkis> is your element a jquery object?
[04:00:36] <ismithers> Seems like your element object doesn't have that method available.
[04:01:26] <lemonsparrow> Uhkis: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/2b695999d2371122a31a
[04:01:30] <kokut> mdev: iframe is usefull if you actually need it
[04:01:53] <mdev> what I do with it is have iframe call a php script that spits out the html that iframe then shows
[04:01:56] <mdev> so it works nicely
[04:03:01] <mdev> it also spits out the javascript/jquery to interact with the popup page
[04:03:15] <mdev> since is seperate page, so yeah man, is good stuff, fancybox is pretty cool
[04:04:24] <zagaza> if I have an <input type="text" value="on"> , can I target it with $("input").val("on"); ?
[04:04:31] <ismithers> Anyone able to input on my carousel issue?
[04:04:48] <mdev> zagaza looks right
[04:05:02] <mdev> or no
[04:05:10] <mdev> just val(); no val("on")
[04:05:22] <zagaza> what if the value is off on another input then mdev?
[04:05:25] <mdev> it'll contain the value on
[04:06:03] <mdev> what is you're trying to get with that? the input value?
[04:06:33] <mdev> you really should be giving each text box either an ID or looping through or using .eq(1) to specify which one
[04:07:04] <mdev> .val("on") may work idk, is weird to me, I see that as setting the value of the first input found to "on"
[04:07:09] <mdev> instead of returning a pointer to it
[04:08:05] <mdev> so yeah I don't think it'd work like you think
[04:08:14] <zagaza> ahh yeah it didn't
[04:08:19] <mdev> if you control the code, just give it an id
[04:08:44] <mdev> <input="text" id="whatever"
[04:09:49] <mdev> alert($("#whatever").val());
[04:09:52] <mdev> will return its value
[04:10:01] <zagaza> ok thanks
[04:10:37] <mdev> also remember to always make id's unique, otherwise you'll get unexpected results
[04:10:46] <mdev> to target multiple at once can just use same class everywhere
[04:13:09] <zagaza> yep, ty ;)
[04:14:06] <mdev> if you want to get the value of a bunch of controls all at once, just put them within a form div
[04:14:38] <mdev> then you can seralize when form is submitted, so comes out like &blah=whatever&this=whatever
[04:15:17] <mdev> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:15:36] <mdev> you have to manually do things for checkboxs though, maybe combo
[04:15:47] <zagaza> got one last question.. sorry I am so basic today with the questions but.. how could I add class hidden to the second wrapper2 when I click the button? http://jsfiddle.net/4hg4nfy6/1/
[04:15:49] <mdev> pretty dumb it's not little more univeral
[04:15:59] <mdev> use .addClass
[04:16:13] <zagaza> yeah but I want to target only the one closest to that button
[04:16:26] <mdev> can use first
[04:16:39] <mdev> .first.addClass('yourclassnodot');
[04:16:54] <mdev> sorry
[04:16:59] <mdev> is .first().addClass
[04:17:38] <mdev> can try https://api.jquery.com/closest/ that too
[04:17:42] <zagaza> http://jsfiddle.net/4hg4nfy6/2/
[04:17:46] <mdev> Description: For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.
[04:17:48] <zagaza> that added hidden to it self
[04:18:30] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8383494/jquery-parent-addclass-not-working-with-hidden-elements
[04:18:59] <mdev> examples there
[04:19:33] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/4hg4nfy6/3/
[04:22:34] <zagaza> ty taplar
[04:24:22] <zagaza> taplar, what if that button was wrapped into yet one parent? how would you then target the outermost target?
[04:24:53] <taplar> use closest(selector) then where the selector is the parent identifier
[04:25:00] <zagaza> ok cool
[04:25:01] <zagaza> ty
[04:33:09] <zetlen> are jquery promises good yet
[04:33:19] <taplar> good?
[04:33:36] <zetlen> well i know they're not compliant yet
[04:33:39] <zetlen> but like, can they compose
[04:33:50] <Cork> zetlen: complient??
[04:34:05] <Cork> zetlen: what jquery implementes isn't meant to be complient
[04:34:07] <zetlen> can i transform values in a .then handler
[04:34:15] <Cork> yes
[04:34:24] <zetlen> and then .then returns a promise for the transformed value?
[04:34:42] <Cork> it returns the deferred that you return in the then handler yes
[04:34:43] <zetlen> i couldn't make that work in the console, i dunno
[04:34:51] <Cork> but no it isn't compatible with promises
[04:34:54] <zetlen> oh i have to return a deferred in the .then handler?
[04:34:57] <zetlen> grody
[04:35:17] <Cork> you have to return what you want the next handler to have access to if you use .then
[04:35:22] <Cork> else use .done
[04:35:56] <zetlen> right, lemme fiddle something up
[04:53:30] <eden__> im unable to force the focus on a textarea using the dev console: $('#mainreport-message').focus();
[04:53:33] <eden__> any ideas why?
[04:53:55] <cannap> document ready?
[04:55:38] <eden__> removing doc ready function makes it work
[04:55:40] <eden__> why?
[05:19:45] <egrodo> Can someone check if this code is correct? http://gyazo.com/4b5aa0ee54d40069d55c823a00f4f43d
[05:21:16] <egrodo> what if I say please?
[05:21:47] <taplar> can you put it in a fiddle?  plus, your asking if it is correct, so that makes me think something is not working?  what is not working?
[05:23:02] <egrodo> sure, never used it before but I'll try. So that code's supposed to add some code every time a user scrolls down the page, an endless page, and I want it to add differnet code for every page it goes down
[05:23:21] <egrodo> The JS won't do anything by itself, at least I don't think so
[05:24:47] <egrodo> putting all the code into the jsfiddle doesn't really work because i'm using blocks, but here
[05:24:53] <egrodo> https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/
[05:28:02] <ifohancroft> Guys, I have html select multiple and a button that when clicked should add the selected option's values to a variable. However it only adds one of them. How can I make it so it adds all of them, so the var becomes array?
[05:28:31] <toomus> Hi all
[05:29:11] <taplar> egrodo: so is something about it not working?
[05:29:13] <ifohancroft> My current code is this: var selectedOptions = $('#options :selected').val();
[05:29:18] <toomus> First my fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/7u5a82tr/
[05:29:24] <ifohancroft> the actual assignment
[05:29:38] <egrodo> Yes, on the third scroll down it displays all of the sections of code at once
[05:29:40] <egrodo> I'll screenshot
[05:30:09] <egrodo> it shows this
[05:30:10] <egrodo> http://gyazo.com/30d1378b90ddf9645313b7bbdaf380a8
[05:30:20] <egrodo> When it's only supposed to show one of those per-scroll-page-thingy
[05:30:32] <taplar> egrodo: well, you may have an issue with your ifs
[05:30:38] <egrodo> ifs?
[05:30:48] <taplar> see your if chain starting at LN 11?
[05:31:02] <egrodo> yes?
[05:31:06] <egrodo> I tried making them if else's
[05:31:08] <taplar> they all have the same conditional except for the number
[05:31:19] <egrodo> but that's so it iterates every time no?
[05:31:24] <egrodo> i'm very new to this language as you can tell
[05:31:29] <taplar> if it falls into the first one, the number is incremented causing a cascade match on all the ifs
[05:32:01] <egrodo> if the number is incremented, so it starts at 1, shouldn't it only incremiment by 1, making the second if statement apply?
[05:32:14] <egrodo> sorry, but thanks a ton for the help, i've been trying to figure this out for hours
[05:32:23] <taplar> so say LN 11 matches
[05:32:27] <taplar> meaning number is 1
[05:32:37] <taplar> it goes in the if, at the end it gets incremented to 2
[05:32:46] <taplar> it then hits LN 15
[05:32:48] <taplar> it's now 2
[05:32:49] <taplar> match
[05:32:54] <taplar> and on and on
[05:32:54] <qakhan> NoiseEee did you see my pastebin
[05:33:30] <egrodo> i'm having trouble seeing what you're saying
[05:33:41] <egrodo> isn't that behaviour intended?
[05:34:01] <taplar> if that's intended, then why not display every one of them in number is 1?
[05:34:11] <taplar> instead of checking multiple times
[05:34:30] <taplar> let me make a tweak
[05:34:58] <egrodo> no no, sorry, that's not intended, I mean, every time you scroll a page worths it's supposed to check again and find that numbr is increased by one, which makes whichever if statement apply
[05:35:00] <egrodo> yeah thank you a ton
[05:37:15] * hellyeah wondering can i have function inside dialog()
[05:37:34] <taplar> egrodo: i think perhaps this is what you were trying to logically achieve https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/2/
[05:38:48] <egrodo> what code did you modify? I copied that into my working enviroment and now every time you scroll a page it shows just the age box
[05:39:03] <taplar> the if blocks starting at line 11
[05:39:17] <egrodo> oooh
[05:39:22] <egrodo> i see, that's a lot cleaner looking
[05:39:23] <toomus> How to make this slide down animation but for elements with variable height? https://jsfiddle.net/7u5a82tr/
[05:40:03] <egrodo> but for some reason that's still not working : ( it shows the same box every scroll
[05:40:39] <taplar> well it looks like your appending the same thing in every if, heh
[05:40:54] <taplar> err, no, text is different
[05:41:13] <egrodo> yeh, i put four different questions
[05:41:13] <taplar> which one is being hit?
[05:41:16] <egrodo> age
[05:41:27] <taplar> oh!
[05:41:32] <taplar> number is a local variable
[05:41:36] <egrodo> might have something to do with the default handler thingy on line 64
[05:41:37] <taplar> it isn't preserved
[05:41:42] <egrodo> huh?
[05:41:50] <taplar> var make numbr a local variable
[05:41:55] <taplar> it's destroyed after the function ends
[05:41:58] <hellyeah> hey
[05:41:59] <taplar> and recreated each time
[05:42:06] <egrodo> Ooooohhh, what should i use instead?
[05:42:08] <egrodo> i feel so dumb aha
[05:42:13] <taplar> move it outside of the function
[05:42:25] <egrodo> so like, line 1?
[05:42:27] <taplar> or store it on something as a data or prop, or use localStorage
[05:42:43] <taplar> sure
[05:43:03] <taplar> or to keep them together put it with your lastScrollTop variable
[05:43:31] <egrodo> I put it on line 1 and it's still showing age every time :/
[05:43:40] <egrodo> and i don't really know how to  use localstorage
[05:44:02] <Kartagis> is a progress bar the sensible way to do 'please wait while this loads'? should/can I do this in parallel?
[05:44:06] <egrodo> hey thanks again, i realize u have no reason to help me but youre saving my ass haha
[05:44:19] <taplar> egrodo: localStorage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[05:44:20] <hellyeah> can i write a function like that pls take a look at 71-81  http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/77/
[05:44:40] <taplar> egrodo: and can you update your fiddle with that you have now
[05:45:08] <egrodo> with localstorage or with putting the var to ln1?
[05:45:14] <egrodo> i gotta read up on localstorage
[05:46:01] <taplar> either one will make it persistent outside the function
[05:46:22] <taplar> just offering options, :)
[05:46:40] <egrodo> yeah, thanks. well, here's where I put it to the top https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/4/
[05:46:50] <egrodo> nothing changed much to my knowledge
[05:47:13] <egrodo> the little jsfiddle display screen is pretty useless aha
[05:48:21] <taplar> weird, for shiggles, take the var off of the numbr
[05:48:45] <egrodo> same :/
[05:49:01] <egrodo> would it have to do with line 64?
[05:49:25] <egrodo> i didn't write this code so i'm not sure if that interferes
[05:50:12] <taplar> ohhh, hmm
[05:50:48] <taplar> lol
[05:51:01] <taplar> so is it just spamming your window with those blocks?
[05:51:25] <egrodo> oh no no, it looks fine, but instead of incrementing at every page scroll it just displays the same one, age, every new page scroll
[05:51:26] <egrodo> i'll screenshot
[05:52:06] <egrodo> http://gyazo.com/f271017acea0a2f0326e7fd6e1ca069c
[05:52:08] <taplar> ah, just wondering cause the if is doing && num == 1 and I don't see that variable being incremented any where
[05:53:06] <egrodo> o shit good point.. let me change that
[05:53:36] <egrodo> removed the && num == 1 thing
[05:53:37] <taplar> i mean the loop stops when n is past the ratio, but i don't think that conditional is doing anything for you
[05:53:41] <taplar> yah
[05:53:49] <egrodo> yeah i removed it but the same thing happens
[05:54:08] <taplar> yeah, that block shouldn't effect your scroll event handler
[05:54:11] <egrodo> i didn't see that, that was leftover from something else i tried earlier ha
[05:54:18] <egrodo> hmm
[05:54:40] <taplar> ok, so numbr is at the top level and you tried removing the var
[05:54:58] <taplar> now try commenting the += 1 part and explicitly set numbr to 2 in the ==1 if block
[05:55:13] <taplar> see if that moves us past that block atleast
[05:55:19] <egrodo> ok, one sec
[05:56:13] <egrodo> same.. results.. wtf? i'll paste
[05:56:27] <egrodo> https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/5/
[05:56:35] <egrodo> make sure i did it right
[05:57:02] <taplar> still got the var on the variable up top
[05:57:24] <taplar> but i'm fixing to tweak it
[05:57:42] <egrodo> oh yeah in that version sorry
[05:58:11] <hellyeah> hey pls check line 87 what can i do to fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/79/
[06:00:40] <taplar> egrodo: try with a prop: https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/8/
[06:02:50] <egrodo> so when putting that code into my working environment, it shows age for teh first two pages then doesn't show anything at all and continues loading profiles
[06:02:52] <egrodo> endlessly
[06:03:37] <taplar> k, one sec
[06:03:57] <egrodo> <3
[06:05:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/10/
[06:05:54] <taplar> i added a variable that is set to true when the handler starts and false when the handler ends.  i wonder if your having an issue with scroll firing multiple times before it increments the number
[06:06:48] <egrodo> maybe.. pasting that code shows age for two scrollpages worth then stops showing anything entirely and ends the page
[06:07:03] <egrodo> also, oddly enough, that messes up my header nav-bar thing.. man javascript is confusing
[06:07:40] <egrodo> brb real quick
[06:10:11] <egrodo> back
[06:12:39] <taplar> one question.  in your html, where is search-result?
[06:14:01] <egrodo> search-result is the class name of every profile, it's inside class results-contianer
[06:14:23] <egrodo> is it not showing in the js fiddle?
[06:14:45] <taplar> i tried a ctrl+f but it's only finding those in the js
[06:15:08] <taplar> ah, i see one
[06:15:12] <egrodo> odd.. here, see if this works
[06:15:13] <egrodo> https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/11/
[06:15:16] <taplar> yeah my ff search acts weird sometimes
[06:15:22] <egrodo> ah ok
[06:16:49] <taplar> so it should only do something when there are 0, 10, 20, 30, etc results
[06:17:04] <egrodo> yes, precisely, aka every page
[06:17:17] <egrodo> if you want other pictures of the site or something let me know
[06:17:21] <taplar> and results are being added as you scroll down currently
[06:17:32] <egrodo> that's the idea@
[06:17:46] <taplar> i mean, are they currently?
[06:17:46] <egrodo> although for now the results (aka profiles) are the same, cause this is a prototype
[06:18:02] <egrodo> yes, they are, but it's jsut the same results every page, because prototype
[06:18:07] <taplar> k
[06:18:07] <egrodo> that's no proble
[06:18:28] <zagaza> can you target closest like this? $('.some-div).clone().appendTo($(this).closest('.form-inner-block'));
[06:18:35] <taplar> just thinking.  i haven't had a ton of past experience handling for scroll events
[06:18:50] <egrodo> no problem, i can't thank you enough
[06:19:01] <taplar> zagaza: sure
[06:20:13] <taplar> heh, ok going to try something
[06:20:21] <zagaza> how could I make it clone .some-div only once? it clones it multiple times
[06:20:28] <egrodo> please do!
[06:20:58] <prohobo> hellyeah stopped asking questions, looks like he's getting the hang of jquery
[06:21:07] * prohobo sighs in relief
[06:21:11] <hellyeah> :D
[06:21:14] <taplar> egrodo: ok try this https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/12/
[06:21:27] <hellyeah> prohobo: do you think jquery is slow?
[06:21:36] <prohobo> why would jquery be slow?
[06:22:09] <egrodo> Age twice and no more profiles after the second one
[06:22:11] <egrodo> ends the page there
[06:22:15] <egrodo> what'dya try?
[06:22:19] <taplar> sweet k
[06:22:19] <hellyeah> someone said this in #web :D
[06:22:31] <prohobo> nah
[06:22:35] <prohobo> jquery is pretty fast
[06:22:53] <prohobo> as long as you don't add a lot of elements to the DOM sequentially it's fine
[06:23:09] <jacobroufa> caching lookups helps
[06:23:14] <taplar> egrodo: now this https://jsfiddle.net/ychds4ko/13/
[06:23:16] <prohobo> yeah
[06:23:29] <taplar> what jacobroufa said
[06:23:42] <jacobroufa> e.g. assign your lookup to a var -----    var $wat = $( '.whatever' )
[06:23:47] <jacobroufa> and then search within that
[06:23:57] <egrodo> taplar: age twice then like, halfway through the third page it end
[06:23:59] <egrodo> ends*
[06:24:10] <taplar> hmm
[06:24:18] <taplar> does it ever go past age?
[06:24:23] <egrodo> not thus far,haha
[06:24:28] <taplar> dang it, lol
[06:24:30] <egrodo> i mean it shows age twice
[06:25:00] <hellyeah> hey i just want to content of popup2 still dont work can you give me little help http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/82/ 107-112
[06:25:17] <taplar> yeah, one age is coming from your bottom part i believe
[06:25:31] <taplar> LN 74
[06:26:00] <egrodo> yeah, any idea why that's there? i didn't write it and i don't wanna fuck anything up
[06:26:10] <taplar> dunno your app, :P
[06:26:17] <taplar> if you don't need it, nix it
[06:27:07] <zagaza> taplar: do you know how could I make it clone .some-div only once? it clones even the classes it has cloned, and on and on
[06:27:49] <egrodo> taplar: hmm, commenting that while loop out and nothing loads past teh first page
[06:28:10] <taplar> zagaza: hmm?  a selector with a class will find all with that class.  if you want to only do one then you'll have to be more granular with your selector or add :first to it
[06:28:22] <zagaza> ah ok thanks!
[06:28:36] <zagaza> :first did it <3
[06:28:50] <hellyeah> damn it
[06:28:55] <hellyeah> gor loops didnt work here
[06:28:57] <hellyeah> for
[06:29:14] <taplar> egrodo: try commenting out just the inner if
[06:29:28] <zagaza> taplar last question.. is there any way to clone an input without cloning the value written inside it?
[06:30:02] <taplar> zagaza: don't believe so, but you can do val('') on it after to clear that
[06:30:32] <hellyeah> fixed that
[06:30:33] <hellyeah> damn
[06:30:59] <hellyeah> wondering can i give width and height inside open function
[06:31:01] <hellyeah> ?
[06:31:06] <egrodo> taplar: doing that, no age or favorite color or any boxes show up, just pages and pages of profiles
[06:31:11] <egrodo> mehhh
[06:31:40] <zagaza> taplar hmm don't quite know where to fit in val('') in this code: $('.somediv:first').clone().appendTo($(this).prevAll('.form-inner-block'));
[06:32:23] <taplar> try after your clone
[06:32:58] <zagaza> like this $('.somediv:first').clone().val('').appendTo($(this).prevAll('.form-inner-block')); ?
[06:33:07] <taplar> is .somediv actually a div?
[06:33:13] <hellyeah> i guess you can give it
[06:33:19] <hellyeah> wow almost got the problem solved
[06:33:23] * hellyeah YAY !
[06:34:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:34:51] <egrodo> taplar: thanks a lot anyways, back to digging through forums!
[06:35:20] <taplar> egrodo: yeah sorry i couldn't be more help.  others maybe able to find the prob.  one thing, the change i made earlier
[06:35:44] <taplar> egrodo: LN 80 and LN 37
[06:36:00] <egrodo> yea?
[06:36:09] <taplar> egrodo: .one() binds an event handler and unbinds it after the first event happens.  I did this to try to limit the number of times your scroll would fire
[06:36:17] <taplar> egrodo: may be a better way
[06:37:10] <egrodo> taplar: okay, thanks, I'll keep that and look into alternatives. I think my best plan for now is to go do javascript courses and actually learn the language  hah
[06:37:23] <taplar> ?learn
[06:37:27] <egrodo> this is for an internship job I'm doing so it's fine if I tell my boss I don't know how to d it
[06:37:28] <taplar> ?api learn
[06:37:31] <taplar> bah
[06:37:38] <egrodo> Hmm?
[06:37:39] <taplar> http://try.jquery.com
[06:37:53] <hellyeah> well
[06:37:55] <taplar> ^ basics page
[06:38:01] <taplar> can be handy
[06:38:03] <hellyeah> didnt accept width and height inside open function
[06:38:18] <egrodo> oh sick, thanks. I'm running thru the codecademy course, do you think that I sholud switch to code school?
[06:38:34] <taplar> egrodo: not familiar
[06:39:14] <foxfire> hi everyone i want to disable panning using jquery
[06:39:19] <foxfire> can anyone help me
[06:39:33] <foxfire> i have a page to scroll but it has pannable elements
[06:39:54] <foxfire> so while scrolling the page these elements are panning undesirably
[06:49:54] <sebb_> hey ! I've got select which looks like this: "---------" - how is it called ? how I can check if this option is checked ?
[06:50:12] <taplar> that would be it's text()
[06:50:23] <taplar> of the option that is
[06:51:02] <decx> is that always the first or a general split?
[06:51:07] <Cork> sebb_: make sure the element is <option value="<identifier>">-------</option>
[06:51:12] <Cork> then you can just check the value
[06:51:31] <sebb_> Cork, yea thats not possible, I cannot set this value on my own, its dynamicaly created
[06:51:42] <decx> if it's a split it should've the disabled prop
[06:51:43] <Cork> sebb_: do the option have a value?
[06:51:47] <sebb_> Nope
[06:52:04] <sebb_> I'm preety sure I have used a thing that was checking if this option is default or something
[06:52:06] <Cork> sebb_: then check $('select').val() == '---------'
[06:52:14] <sebb_> Cork, Can I somehow check index ?
[06:52:22] <sebb_> this default always has 0 index
[06:52:23] <DarsVaeda> can anyone see why I get an error here: http://jsfiddle.net/2aby87m7/ ?
[06:52:52] <Cork> sebb_: you could do something like $('select option:selected').index() == 0
[06:52:58] <Cork> but is is less reliable
[06:53:11] <Cork> as if you use groups in the select it will break
[06:53:34] <decx> could also check selectedIndex on the select
[06:53:41] <Cork> rtue
[06:53:43] <Cork> *true
[06:53:52] <decx> less traversing, not that it matters
[06:53:55] <Cork> $('select').prop('selectedIndex') == 0
[06:54:09] <Cork> but it is much more reliable
[06:54:19] <sebb_> ok checking it now
[06:54:21] <decx> yeah select option:selected is iffy
[06:54:21] <Cork> as it isn't affected by option groups
[06:54:49] <Cork> i basically never use selectedIndex so i tend to forget it exists :)
[06:55:38] <foxfire> any geeks for my rescue
[06:55:39] <foxfire> ?
[06:56:11] <sebb_> works like a charm thanks
[06:56:12] <DarsVaeda> I don't see why an error is raised although my request returns a 200 and the error is just "error" :/
[06:56:21] <Cork> foxfire: what do you mean by panning?
[06:56:25] <taplar> DarsVaeda: i was seeing a cors error
[06:56:35] <hellyeah> hey
[06:56:44] <Cork> DarsVaeda: check the tried argument to the callback
[06:56:54] <hellyeah> it doesnt accept maxWidth line 90 can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/84/
[06:57:11] <foxfire> Cork: ok consider a webpage
[06:57:19] <foxfire> with a map in it
[06:57:37] <foxfire> panning is moving the map around without scrolling the page verticallly
[06:57:55] <DarsVaeda> taplar, where do you see that?
[06:58:11] <taplar> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://img.youtube.com/vi/iMGh8VtBetc/default.jpg. (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing).
[06:58:50] <foxfire> Cork: think you are viewing the webpage on a touch-screen mobile
[06:59:21] <Cork> ah
[06:59:34] <DarsVaeda> taplar, I tried with firebug and live http headers plugin don't see that -.-
[06:59:40] <Cork> DarsVaeda: ya, you can only fetch js cross domain unless the controlling server allows it
[07:00:06] <taplar> it's in my ff console as an error
[07:00:10] <Cork> well <img> and <video> works too
[07:01:07] <DarsVaeda> taplar, ah thanks it is a warning, I didn't display those
[07:09:02] <PCatinean> Most of the stuff is now solved, thank you for the help Cork !
[07:20:58] <Dr-007> i'm using a jquery plugin that creates google maps and manages markers and such. im trying to save data into the marker so when i click on the marker i can access that data

[07:20:59] <Dr-007>     Drupal.behaviors.sowifi_campaign_google_maps = {
[07:20:59] <Dr-007>         attach: function (context, settings) {
[07:20:59] <Dr-007>         },
[07:21:00] <Dr-007>         
[07:21:00] <Dr-007>         load: function(context, settings) {

[07:21:02] <Dr-007>             
[07:21:02] <Dr-007> oops
[07:21:07] <Dr-007> http://pastebin.com/XRaBDxr7
[07:21:16] <Dr-007> thats my code
[07:21:42] <Dr-007> when i console.log(this.router) it return true instead of the object i expect
[07:22:36] <Dr-007> i've also tried marker.data('router', router); and inside the click function i tried to access that data
[07:23:07] <Dr-007> i'm kind of lost. so any pointers would be appreciated
[07:23:32] <zagaza> taplar this val thing didn't work.. does it look wrong? it doesn't clear the inputs $('.somediv:first').clone().val('').appendTo($(this).prevAll('.form-inner-block'));
[07:23:57] <taplar> zagaza: guess you missed it.  is .somediv an actual div?
[07:24:05] <zagaza> yeah
[07:24:09] <zagaza> or wait
[07:24:12] <taplar> use html() instead
[07:24:48] <zagaza> ahh right.. it's not an input, its the input wrapper
[07:24:58] <notchris> How do I make a jquery function so that I can call it again via function();
[07:25:12] <zagaza> taplar html instead of clone?
[07:25:21] <taplar> zagaza: instead of val()
[07:25:24] <zagaza> ah ok
[07:25:37] <taplar> notchris: example use case?
[07:26:10] <zagaza> taplar in that case it clears all the html within, inputs and everything
[07:26:33] <taplar> zagaza: yep, if that's not what your after, what are you after?
[07:26:44] <zagaza> sec
[07:26:46] <zagaza> i'll make a fiddle
[07:27:04] <taplar> are you actually trying to clear a contained input element?
[07:30:25] <zagaza> yes taplar
[07:31:34] <taplar> zagaza: probably best to break it up then, if only for readability.  var clonedDiv = $('.somediv:first').clone();  clonedDiv.find('input').val('');  clonedDiv.appendTo($(this).prevAll('.form-inner-block'));
[07:51:43] <ceramicskull> shoky: now I understand what you meant yesterday, thanks though! I got something working out of it. I pushed all goal names into a new array and removed any duplicates
[07:58:37] <skullcrasher> can anybody tell me how I can handle google maps events with my vanilla js? (no google.maps.addListener(....))
[07:58:49] <skullcrasher> more like on('google.maps.event',function() ....
[07:58:52] <shoky> ceramicskull: you left before i could reply, i wanted to suggest _.groupBy from underscore/lodash  for what you were doing
[08:01:22] <ceramicskull> shoky: Hmm, I'm just trying to do this with straight up jquery only since it's a desktop application really
[08:01:43] <shoky> oks
[08:02:16] <notchris> If I have a list I want to create object items out of
[08:02:26] <notchris> But the list items dont have any specific identifier
[08:02:35] <notchris> How can I set every nth list item to a certain value
[08:04:32] <decx> a modulo operator in a filter
[08:05:56] <notchris> So what if I wanted to select every 3rd list item
[08:06:00] <notchris> starting with the first list item
[08:06:48] <decx> $('li').not(function(i,el){  return i % 3   })
[08:08:58] <acmehandle> This might be an inside out question.  But is there a way to attach an event listener once.  For example I have a $.getJSON().done()  In the done I'm put in a call to a function with an on.('click')  listener, however that on click listener also uses the function that has that $.getJSON method.  So as a result the on.('click') listern is attached several times.  Is there a way to prevent it from being attached again
[08:09:15] <decx> one insteead of on
[08:09:32] <ceramicskull> shoky: any thoughts? I just found a flaw in my logic once again, now I'm pushing the dups into a new array, but it's not including my obj.key only the obj.val into my array. Here's an example of what I'm doing. How do I push the obj.key along with it?
[08:09:33] <decx> that'll kill the binding after the first execution
[08:09:48] <ceramicskull> http://jsfiddle.net/cse_tushar/wtXx4/
[08:10:32] <acmehandle> decx, problem with using one instead of on, is that if the user clicks on other elements in the list that is generated the on.click is disabled
[08:11:27] <acmehandle> Although, one second let me try again
[08:11:57] <acmehandle> I have been experimenting with a variety of ways to try to handle this.  I remember I tried one earlier and it did not work
[08:12:05] <acmehandle> as I wante
[08:12:08] <acmehandle> d
[08:13:19] <decx> one should only count for the actual element you clicked
[08:13:36] <decx> so if you have a collection of elements with one bound then you should be able to click them all once
[08:13:37] <shoky> ceramicskull: http://jsfiddle.net/wtXx4/50/
[08:14:10] <acmehandle> I just tried it and I'm getting failure.  Hang on let me try to put a jsfiddle together
[08:15:21] <acmehandle> even with 'one' it is still getting a listener handler bound each time
[08:18:03] <shoky> ceramicskull: and here's example of how you can iterate over this collection  http://jsfiddle.net/wtXx4/51/
[08:18:17] <shoky> ceramicskull: no jquery needed
[08:18:33] <ceramicskull> : O
[08:19:46] <ceramicskull> That's so simple compared to the route I was trying to take
[08:21:10] <decx> what a confusing structure tho
[08:27:49] <ceramicskull> shoky: you da best, so much better than what I was trying, but was I on some what the right path?
[08:29:02] <acmehandle> How can i check in, say for example firebug if an event is bound and where?  Where would I look in the DOM button?
[08:29:14] <shoky> ceramicskull: on the path yeah, you would've gotten it after a bit ;p
[08:29:22] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle look at the element inspector.
[08:29:34] <robertmaxrees> you'll see a little "ev" next to each node you care about.
[08:35:02] <acmehandle> Yeah, it looks like I get multiple on click functions bound after the first click
[08:35:06] <acmehandle> it seems to compound
[08:35:17] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle are you running .on() or .click() multiple times?
[08:36:06] <acmehandle> I'm triggering it in a $.getJSON().done(functionTriggerint_Click_Listerner)
[08:36:08] <robertmaxrees> because previous handlers aren't removed/prevented from running when you run other bindings.
[08:36:13] <acmehandle> I'm triggering it in a $.getJSON().done(functionTriggerint_Click_Listerner() )  More specifically
[08:36:28] <robertmaxrees> err...
[08:36:36] <robertmaxrees> .done(functionTriggerint_Click_Listerner() ) < does that function return a function?
[08:36:51] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you actually want .done(functionTriggerint_Click_Listerner)
[08:37:08] <acmehandle> Yep,  That is where the $().on('click', function() { })  live
[08:37:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[08:37:23] <acmehandle> oh..
[08:37:28] <robertmaxrees> all aroudn the wrong way :)
[08:37:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd still want to leave off the (), but even then you're re-binding listeners - you want to use a delegated listener instea.d
[08:37:56] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:38:37] <robertmaxrees> and then get your bindings out of that callback.
[08:38:43] <acmehandle> But leave off the () either way?
[08:38:47] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[08:39:02] <robertmaxrees> you want to reference the object, not the return of the function.
[08:39:23] <acmehandle> Yeah,  I was experimenting with Delagate before but I couldnt figure it out
[08:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you want .on() - $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[08:40:22] <robertmaxrees> where "parent" is an element that exists on pageload that's an ancestor of the things you care about.
[08:42:15] <acmehandle> Actually, that was $.Deferred() that I was trying to understand.
[08:42:25] <acmehandle> Would $.Deferred() also be useful in this case?
[08:42:43] <robertmaxrees> deferreds and event bindings are different concepts :)
[08:42:52] <acmehandle> Ah.  I c
[08:42:53] <robertmaxrees> it totally depends on what you're doing.
[08:43:53] <acmehandle> A slightly different is there a way to check on the console which methods or variables that I have programmed in are available?
[08:44:01] <acmehandle> * a slightely different question
[08:44:05] <acmehandle> slightly
[08:44:24] <robertmaxrees> errr, not necessarily?  you can browse dom objects but that's not going to tell you much.
[08:44:43] <robertmaxrees> and you should be encapsulating things in a way that makes it so you can't really do that anyway.
[08:44:52] <robertmaxrees> check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/ though.
[08:44:57] <robertmaxrees> it might help you understand your dev tools better.
[08:45:51] <acmehandle> Aha.
[09:11:03] <acmehandle> robertmaxrees, should I not put the event handler in to a function?  But if I dont how would I call it from inside $.getJSON().done(function() { functionContaining_onClickListener; });    And you say that functionContaining_onClickListner should not be functionContaining_onClickListener();
[09:11:38] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be re-binding from within .done() at all.
[09:12:00] <ceramicskull> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/wtXx4/52/ now console log auto reads the quotes, but when I print out my results into a csv I'm getting the &quot; stuff, I tried to replace them but it's still returning with &quot; in the csv, I tried searching around to see if I just getting it wrong. I've tried multiple ways, even text.toString().replace(); T_T
[09:13:06] <acmehandle> Maybe it would be wiser to use an  'onclick=' tag in the element?
[09:13:18] <ceramicskull> or robertmaxrees?
[09:14:32] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle no.
[09:14:35] <robertmaxrees> onclick attributes are bad.
[09:14:39] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener./
[09:16:51] <acmehandle> Sorry if I sound obtuse.  But use the delegated listener in the .done(function() { }) chainged to the $.getJSON method right?
[09:17:48] <sdubois_> I have a div that I apply a class to after scrolling down 53 pixels on the page that makes the div fixed
[09:17:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:17:51] <robertmaxrees> outside of that, acmehandle
[09:18:13] <sdubois_> I have a div that I apply a class to after scrolling down 53 pixels on the page that makes the div fixed. how can I make it so this div doesnt "snap" in place, but rather has a smoother transition
[09:18:47] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:19:00] <acmehandle> Am I  chaining it to the .getJSON method?  Or calling the delegated listener outside of the function containing the $.getJSON method?
[09:19:32] * notchris is back
[09:19:35] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle outside of the entire thing, acme
[09:21:36] <notchris> How do I turn each of theses span to an object item? http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/rqxceosn/
[09:23:16] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/rqxceosn/1/
[09:23:22] <notchris> I’m only getting one of the results as an item
[09:23:44] <acmehandle> robertmaxreees, you said ealier where 'parent' is an element that exists on page load.  But the child will be 'li div'  So is that how I should construct it in on click ie:  .on('click', 'li div', function() { });
[09:24:00] <acmehandle> and the child will only exist *after the getJSON data is returned
[09:25:03] <acmehandle> Or is that the whole idea behind a delegated listener.  Designed to listen to something after something else has occured
[09:25:34] <acmehandle> Ah, yes that seems to be the case as explained in the link you pointed me to
[09:26:05] <acmehandle> Slowly the knowledge starts to seep its way through my thick skull.  :-)
[09:28:32] <taplar> gotta be careful about that seepage.  means there's a hole some where
[09:28:52] <acmehandle> Maybe I should have said osmosis?
[09:28:54] <acmehandle> Same thing no?
[09:29:11] <acmehandle> Or a delegated effect?
[09:29:20] <taplar> heh
[09:29:26] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:29:33] <notchris> wb robbyoconnor
[09:29:35] <notchris> robertmaxrees:
[09:30:14] <taplar> he prefers matrix over connor
[09:32:03] <acmehandle> Now I understand what that second delegated portion of .on('click', 'delegated'  .... means
[09:32:09] <acmehandle> or rather what its for
[09:32:14] <robertmaxrees> bubbling.
[09:32:28] <shoky> ceramicskull: no idea what you're doing and what's the problem
[09:32:44] <notchris> robertmaxrees: How do i make it set each item’s type rather than one item? http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/rqxceosn/1/
[09:33:02] <acmehandle> Yes, I heard the term bubbling before.  But it makes sense when it is painfully and clearly illustred to me after  having suffered from it for the last 24 hours
[09:34:36] <robertmaxrees> so you get why you don't re-run things after your ajax finishes now?
[09:36:11] <[non]> http://plnkr.co/edit/jRI26nFrzr2ryhHMygIP?p=preview could anyone help me why this virtual keyboard isnt working?
[09:36:14] <[non]> sorry
[09:36:22] <acmehandle> Indeed.  I didnt even see it that way though.  I was just trying to figure out how to launch that function which contains the .on click listener.  But it turned out that every time that getJSON was finished running it would bind yet another listner
[09:36:22] <robertmaxrees> err.
[09:36:38] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle right.
[09:36:48] <robertmaxrees> [non] that's a question for the angular channel.
[09:36:54] <[non]> sorry
[09:37:02] <robertmaxrees> it's okay :)
[09:37:35] <robertmaxrees> notchris errr.
[09:37:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:37:48] <acmehandle> I'm still having a problem because it seems to insist on running a getJSON for the item clicked and the previous item clicked...or so it appears that way
[09:37:59] <robertmaxrees> notchris there's only one item.
[09:38:01] <acmehandle> so I have to polish this a little more.  But the compounding effect is gone
[09:38:07] <robertmaxrees> notchris are you trying to create an array?
[09:38:08] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I know its overwriting
[09:38:14] <notchris> I wanted to create an item for each span value
[09:38:21] <robertmaxrees> notchris define "an item".
[09:38:26] <taplar> notchris: http://jsfiddle.net/rqxceosn/2/
[09:38:28] <notchris> so my object is item
[09:38:29] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle you could always share your code somewher.e
[09:39:03] <robertmaxrees> notchris what data structure do you want to end up with?
[09:39:32] <notchris> item > item (1) > type = 3
[09:39:41] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[09:39:42] <notchris> item > item(2) > type = 6
[09:39:49] <robertmaxrees> please show me an example in the fiddle of the object.
[09:40:55] <notchris> Ahh
[09:40:56] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/rqxceosn/2/
[09:40:58] <notchris> That’s what I wanted
[09:41:01] <notchris> Sorry about that
[09:41:01] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/rqxceosn/3/
[09:41:02] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[09:41:04] <notchris> Thank you taplar
[09:41:24] <robertmaxrees> that's going to give you a jquery object fwiw.
[09:41:33] <decx> return (i + 1) % 3 == 0 ? { type: $(this).text() } : null; to do only every third
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> try http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rqxceosn/4/
[09:41:44] <acmehandle> I think I'm wrong.  The code actually appears to be functioning as expected now.
[09:41:51] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle cool.
[09:42:23] <acmehandle> I'm watching it scroll by on the console and there is a lot of stuff that is getting printed from the loop and the only differentiation is one line that is not easy to detect visually right away
[09:42:44] <robertmaxrees> acmehandle it's really hard for us to help you without seeing any code at this point.
[09:43:19] <acmehandle> I understand.  But you have been a tremendous help thus far robertmaxrees, and I think Im good from here on in.  :-)
[09:43:27] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[09:43:35] <voiter> is it intentional that leaving an input field with tab does not trigger onblur?
[09:43:53] <taplar> voiter: should trigger it
[09:44:19] <voiter> taplar, are you sure? in my testcase it doesn't.
[09:44:33] <taplar> blur is when a field loses focus, so yeah
[09:44:47] <robertmaxrees> voiter do you dynamically add the inputs?
[09:45:27] <voiter> stupid me. i forgot that newer debug tools don't show all messages in new lines but have a counter on the right. wide screens do have disadvantages. sorry all.
[09:45:38] <taplar> heh
[09:47:14] <notchris> taplar: Can I make it so that each object is every 3 spans?
[09:47:40] <taplar> hmm
[09:47:51] <robertmaxrees> notchris... somebody already answered that question for you.
[09:48:23] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Sorry I mean, span 1, 2 & 3 are items in each object
[09:48:29] <notchris> And the next would be 4,5,6
[09:48:44] <robertmaxrees> notchris...
[09:48:51] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I’m trying to understand
[09:48:54] <robertmaxrees> provide us an exmaple of the final object you want and we'll help you get there.
[09:49:05] <robertmaxrees> but us giving you answers isn't really going to help you learn much :)
[09:49:29] <taplar> i'm also wondering if any of this could be made easier with data elements
[09:51:55] <notchris> robertmaxrees: This is what I’m trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/rqxceosn/6/
[09:52:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valkid JS object.
[09:52:58] <robertmaxrees> please show us a valid JS object
[09:53:13] <taplar> also is the markup up for modification?
[09:53:58] <decx> that's an array bru
[09:54:04] <decx> with and array in it
[09:54:07] <decx> an*
[10:23:16] <acmehandle> Where can I announce that google chrome is a leaky resource hog
[10:23:26] <taplar> u just did
[10:25:34] <acmehandle> I figureed there may be a place that is 'off topic but on topic to what I said'
[10:26:33] <charlie_> I’m triyng to highlight a specific point on a flot js chart. Any idea why it wont work http://jsfiddle.net/9x7aJ/4815/ ?
[10:26:41] <charlie_> https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md
[10:28:38] <decx> you never put your object in a plot var
[10:28:52] <decx> it's right there in the intro
[10:29:23] <acmehandle> Also, where can I announce that firefox is light years better than chrome.  Because firefox actually plays nice with other browsers.  But chrome insists on sucking up as much as possible and blocking everything else.
[10:30:04] <taplar> sounds almost political
[10:30:27] <taplar> lol, sorry, i can tell you've been tramatized
[10:32:38] <acmehandle> Indeed I am being traumatized.  I was sent a link to a google + help page.  as soon as I launched it in my chrome browser my firefox started to hang
[10:32:48] <acmehandle> prior to that everything was just fine.
[10:33:26] <acmehandle> Then I killed that page and chrome is now stepping all over everything.
[10:33:35] <acmehandle> I restared chrome and the problem continues
[10:33:36] <charlie_> decx: ah, thank you :)
[10:34:13] <acmehandle> My firefox pages wont rerender now and I have to restart all of my browsers.
[10:34:38] <taplar> sure you didn't catch some sort of virus?
[10:36:32] <acmehandle> I feel fine, I dont know what my physical state has anything to do with my computer
[10:42:28] <ceramicskull> sorry shoky was eating - anyways, in the array, sometimes I receive results with double quotes. I want to escape the double quotes for the CSV. They come out as &quot; in the CSV rather than "
[10:45:05] <taplar> ceramicskull: i believe in csv files literal double quotes are escaped with another double quote
[10:45:46] <pi-_> http://hastebin.com/yatipiheyi.xml <-- I'm a little confused by this test I've written.  The HTML page makes a request, which gets handled by flask. But it appears that `req_json` is "None".
[10:46:03] <pi-_> Can anyone see if I am making some JavaScript error?
[10:55:04] <ceramicskull> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/wtXx4/52/ the only difference is I'm inserting the console logged items into a CSV, but it keeps returning as &quot;
[10:56:39] <taplar> um, if there is a chance that the string you are replacing appears more than once in a string you have to use the global option
[10:57:20] <taplar> ex "hey there".replace(/e/g, "3") --> "h3y th3r3"
[10:58:24] <taplar> not sure if that's your issue, but i did see that
[10:59:28] <ceramicskull> so it'll look like .replace(/", """)
[10:59:59] <ceramicskull> oops .replace(\", """)
[11:00:19] <taplar> replace(/"/g, '""') perhaps
[11:02:35] <ceramicskull> hmmm the csv still outputting &quot;Most Popular Goal&quot; ;(
[11:06:05] <taplar> are you taking your escaped text and putting it back on the element that your sending to the back?
[11:06:25] <taplar> replace doesn't replace the original
[11:07:25] <ceramicskull> hmmm
[11:08:06] <ceramicskull> is there a way to remove it? I don't need to have quotes
[11:08:31] <ceramicskull> but having &quot; in my csv does sure look ugly D:
[11:08:33] <taplar> sure, second parameter would just be an empty string
[11:10:58] <sdubois_> I have a div that I apply a class to after scrolling down 53 pixels on the page that makes the div fixed. how can I make it so this div doesnt "snap" in place, but rather has a smoother transition
[11:17:03] <taplar> sdubois_: you might could do something with the css transition property
[11:19:20] <shoky> pi-_: have you tried just  contentType: 'application/json'   ?
[11:24:41] <BillCriswell> sdubois_: How is it snapping? Have a demo? what you're doing sounds like it should work fine as long as you're setting it to fixed when you're supposed to.
[11:30:01] <pi-_> shoky: no luck alas.
[11:30:12] <pi-_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31595344/send-json-encoded-data-from-javascript-to-flask-using-ajax
[11:30:34] <sdubois_> BillCriswell: i think i got it looking okay
[11:30:46] <sdubois_> have to be VERY percise when applying the style
[11:30:48] <btracht> can anyone help me with a simple image fadein script?
[11:31:04] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ btracht
[11:31:05] <btracht> images stack
[11:31:07] <btracht> http://pastebin.com/pK1wuudw
[11:31:07] <robertmaxrees> awww bad bot.
[11:31:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:31:26] <Kartagis> is a progress bar the sensible way to do 'please wait while this loads'? should/can I do this in parallel?
[11:31:40] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i'd use a simple spinner animation.
[11:31:43] <taplar> Kartagis: our aps use a spinner
[11:32:04] <Kartagis> taplar: what app?
[11:32:09] <Kartagis> mobile?
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis almost all of them ;)
[11:32:17] <taplar> my company's internal sites
[11:32:43] <Kartagis> I'm going to use this in a cordova app
[11:32:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use a simple spinner.
[11:33:37] <Kartagis> let's say there is a 3sec delay while fetching the json
[11:33:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:33:44] <robertmaxrees> use a spinner.
[11:33:48] <taplar> lol
[11:33:52] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's for.
[11:34:03] <Kartagis> will using a spinner not extend this?
[11:34:03] <shoky> pi-_:  tried removing the .get_data() call and just doing .get_json()  ?
[11:34:09] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis nope.
[11:34:24] <Kartagis> k, I'll try that
[11:34:33] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis before you fire the request, you show the spinner.  when you run the .done(), you hide it.
[11:34:38] <taplar> if a spinner degrades your apps performance you got bigger problems
[11:34:40] <robertmaxrees> or in an .always() or whatever.
[11:34:54] <BillCriswell> most progress bars are bull shit anyway.
[11:35:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day
[11:35:44] <Kartagis> is http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/ too much?
[11:35:49] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:35:52] <btracht> here is the page - http://cpsamerica.net/temp/image_fade.html
[11:35:56] <robertmaxrees> you just need to .show() and .hide() and image.
[11:36:04] <robertmaxrees> or container.
[11:36:18] <taplar> font awesome has some nice spinners too
[11:36:26] <pi-_> shoky: yes. Although I've only just noticed that those two calls are probably either/or. But anyway, it didn't make any difference.
[11:36:55] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://connoratherton.com/loaders there are some small options
[11:36:57] <shoky> pi-_: and do you see the data being sent ok in the browser's network devtools?
[11:37:04] <Kartagis> success:function() { $(".spinner").hide(); }
[11:37:12] <shoky> pi-_: cause your jquery code is fine. seems like a flask issue
[11:37:15] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you should be using .done(), but yeah basically.
[11:37:56] <shoky> pi-_: and that answer about setting 'json' instead of 'data' is about using python's own http request libraries, not jquery
[11:37:59] <pi-_> There is another small problem in that when I click the button, the browser now shows the return value that flask returned.  But I can't see anywhere in my code that I'm asking it to do this.  How can I disable that?
[11:38:14] <shoky> what do you mean the browser shows?
[11:38:16] <shoky> in the console?
[11:38:42] <pi-_> nope, in the main window
[11:38:48] <shoky> huh..
[11:38:59] <pi-_> As if it is displaying a text file.
[11:39:01] <shoky> are you submitting a form or something?
[11:39:12] <shoky> thought you just had a plain <button> and that's it
[11:40:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah, if buttons are in a form they're submit buttons.. you have to add type="button" to the button oddly enough... =/
[11:40:32] <pi-_> http://pasteboard.co/2b9AGUxb.png
[11:40:41] <pi-_> thanks BillCriswell!
[11:41:10] <shoky> so it's in a form?
[11:42:22] <pi-_> meh I don't think so... I am still using the code in that SO question
[11:42:41] <pi-_> And I just tried that and it didn't fix
[11:42:45] <BillCriswell> It should be easy to find out...
[11:42:50] <testerbit> I'm trying to animate a scrollto, I when I use this syntax is just jumps to the location, seemingly ignoring the time, how can I have it scroll over 2 seconds? $(window).animate(scrollTo(0, 800) , 2000);
[11:42:54] <shoky> that's weird then...
[11:43:08] <shoky> pi-_ check what happens in the network tab
[11:43:18] <shoky> make sure to preserve logs between navigation
[11:43:21] <robertmaxrees> testerbit share a fiddle of the entire binding.
[11:43:31] <BillCriswell> testerbit: Did you look at the documentation for .animate() ?
[11:44:35] <testerbit> BillCriswell, yes, in short I'm trying to add a slow down to this: window.scrollTo(0, offsetTop);
[11:45:34] <BillCriswell> The first argument for animate should be a plain object, you're giving it a function.
[11:45:57] <testerbit> how should scrollTo be converted to an object?
[11:46:47] <BillCriswell> It wouldn't. You can give it something like { scrollTop: '800px' } though.
[11:48:59] <pi-_> Sorry, I must have been sitting in front of the computer for too long. I was pointing my browser to http://pipad.org/flask/oembed when it should have been pointing at http://pipad.org/sendmidi.html
[11:49:20] <shoky> :o
[11:50:27] <pi-_> wow it works
[11:50:30] <pi-_> Sorry about that
[11:50:44] <testerbit> BillCriswell, I tried $(window).animate({scrollTop: '800px'}, 2000);, but there is no scroll, just a window function in the console
[11:50:50] <pi-_> I Betta scrub that SO question
[11:54:12] <BillCriswell> testerbit: I made a mistake, should be using $('body,html').animate(); http://jsbin.com/dexoco/1/edit?js,output
[11:56:05] <mrkie> is it possible to hide any div with jquery that contains a specific line of text?
[11:56:43] <taplar> mrkie: sure you can filter elements on their text
[11:58:53] <testerbit> thanks BillCriswell
[12:00:05] <juro> Hi, any idea how I can handle an error on this load? http://jsfiddle.net/juro/cjcf1jda/
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> what error?
[12:00:58] <juro> robertmaxrees, when you check the fiddle, the second image does not exist, so I need to catch that and display a "not found" placeholder
[12:01:58] <BillCriswell> testerbit: No problem.
[12:07:52] <mrkie> taplar: it is like $("div p:contains('textstring')").parent('div').hide();
[12:07:57] <mrkie> but there is no <p> i use
[12:08:15] <mrkie> and it is not the parent div it is the actuall div
[12:08:46] <mrkie> $("div:contains('TRIAL')").hide(); like this?
[12:08:53] <taplar> mrkie: i was actually referring to the use of filter()
[12:08:57] <mrkie> $("div:contains('anystring')").hide(); like this?
[12:09:16] <robertmaxrees> mrkie you could do that, but i'd suggest using .filter(); personally.
[12:10:00] <mrkie> ok
[12:10:31] <mrkie> but what if there is a javascript that generates the div that needs to be not shown, like i use a on document ready
[12:10:45] <robertmaxrees> then run your code after whatever generates it.
[12:10:47] <mrkie> is that also possible to hide after it?
[12:11:09] <taplar> guess juro left
[12:11:16] <mrkie> yeah, but i don't know where to place the code, because i don't know what will trigger it
[12:11:33] <robertmaxrees> mrkie err... then you need to fix the code that generates it.
[12:11:38] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to actually solve here?
[12:11:58] <mrkie> it is actually a plugin that has TRIAL inside it :)
[12:11:58] <juro> ok, let's try that again ....
[12:12:02] <juro> sorry, robbyoconnor
[12:12:10] <juro> sorry, robertmaxrees
[12:12:10] <mrkie> so it's like that
[12:12:14] <robertmaxrees> mrkie uh.
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> respect the developer in that case.
[12:12:27] <taplar> juro: it looks like you can attach an error() to the object your loading on that will execute if the image gets a 404
[12:12:33] <mrkie> robertmaxrees: yeah sure
[12:12:54] <juro> taplar, I tried that but couldn't find any information on how to :(
[12:13:16] <taplar> $(selector).on('load', ....).error(function(e){});
[12:13:36] <juro> taplar, thank you, I'll try that again
[12:14:02] <taplar> in my fiddle it took it a bit to get the 404 so it's not an immediate failure
[12:14:05] <taplar> or may not be
[12:16:40] <juro> taplar, that is fine for my purpose
[12:29:41] <btracht> please help https://jsfiddle.net/4epa1rs8/
[12:30:59] <taplar> btracht: what's the issue?
[12:37:07] <btracht> taplar: images are stacking instead of overlaying
[12:38:42] <taplar> btracht: your css definition that has position absolute, it doesn't look like it is on anything.  and also that definition is for an id.  if you want to put it on multiples you'll want a class
[12:42:30] <btracht> taplar: updated still doing the same thing https://jsfiddle.net/4epa1rs8/1/
[12:43:06] <taplar> the position absolute needs to be on the images
[12:43:27] <taplar> or whatever elements you want to stack
[12:44:46] <btracht> oh ok
[12:44:48] <btracht> thanks
[12:45:42] <btracht> that fixed it
[12:46:10] <juro> taplar, ok, I got it working. http://jsfiddle.net/juro/cjcf1jda/5/ However, when I run it, the console still shows the error - any idea how to not show that error in the console?
[12:48:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[12:48:38] <taplar> 404.  not entirely sure if js can change how your browser logs request errors
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> js can't touch those.
[12:48:58] <taplar> most users are not going to be looking at their console anyway
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:49:34] <juro> hmm, ok ... how can I wait for a specific time to try to load and then cancel the request and show a not found?
[12:49:53] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to load invalid images?
[12:50:04] <btracht> taplar: when i add the class to images the text under image is now behind
[12:50:17] <btracht> how do i correct that
[12:50:27] <juro> robertmaxrees, it is for a backend that has products that might have images loaded on the website.
[12:50:34] <taplar> btracht: you'll have to position your text as well
[12:50:45] <robertmaxrees> juro yeah, you need to handle that server-side then.
[12:50:53] <taplar> position absolute effectively removed an element from affecting the placement of other elements
[12:50:55] <robertmaxrees> check to see if the image exists.  if not, don't try to load it.
[12:51:02] <juro> robertmaxrees, ok, thx
[12:51:33] <taplar> removed = removes
[12:52:15] <btracht> got it
[12:59:30] <taplar> hmm, sounds like i may be driving home in the rain
[12:59:37] <robertmaxrees> lucky.
[12:59:48] <taplar> yeah, definately need it
[12:59:55] <robertmaxrees> you in CA?
[13:00:00] <taplar> AR
[13:00:11] <mrkie> $(document).'click'(function() { is therer something like this?
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:00:27] <robertmaxrees> $('document').on('click', function() {});
[13:00:27] <taplar> on('click', function(){})
[13:00:33] <taplar> avoid putting it on the document

[14:03:45] <amtrivedi> I am using this jquery color picker
[14:03:49] <amtrivedi> http://laktek.github.io/really-simple-color-picker/demo.html
[14:04:29] <amtrivedi> Now, when I copy paste the page source of this into a new file and run it, it does not shows the expected result.
[14:04:36] <amtrivedi> Here is the code I am using -
[14:04:44] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/28HY7N1#line-10
[14:04:55] <amtrivedi> What am I doing wrongly?
[14:05:47] <amtrivedi> https://i.imgur.com/ANXcBfP.png
[14:05:57] <amtrivedi> ^ This is how the output looks for me
[14:06:09] <amtrivedi> It is basically not showing the color palette.
[14:07:55] <tasaif> amtrivedi, did you use http://github.com/laktek/really-simple-color-picker/zipball/master ?
[14:09:13] <amtrivedi> tasaif: No, I just used the raw version of colorPicker.js
[14:11:06] <amtrivedi> tasaif: How do I use that in my current setup?
[14:24:03] <jonez> greetings. wanted to share a positive experience using jquery. I use jquery ui and specifically 'tooltip' to do some cool stuff with 'member details' on my website.
[14:32:17] <infoget> is it possible short this line? $("#txt-count").text($("#txt-count").text() + "123");
[14:34:51] <zzaichik1> try it and find out
[15:15:26] <SmashingX2> how can I open a link in a different broswer window with anchor tag?
[15:39:45] <markholmes> SmashingX2, $('a').click(function() { window.open('google.com') });
[17:34:30] <WebDragon> good god this is the quietest I've ever seen this channel
[17:34:32] <WebDragon> what happened?
[17:35:01] <WebDragon> 660 lurkers and nothing going on
[17:36:12] <WebDragon> could use some help getting jquery.validate to work -- had it working previously on a static site but have lost something in the translation to a CMS even though we're using the same code
[17:36:25] <WebDragon> hmm welll
[17:36:34] <WebDragon> now that just made me think of something else
[17:36:35] <WebDragon> brb
[17:43:30] <shoky> o.O
[19:27:16] <FrankD__> Hi, I'm having a problem using $.each with an object containing objects, I tried to go straight JS and seem to be having the same issue
[19:40:49] <az0xff> win c
[21:11:28] <acidjazz> ok so im doing something where the user puts a url in an input box
[21:11:58] <acidjazz> i want to verify the URL works
[21:12:04] <acidjazz> i need to decide when to fire the url sanitization
[21:14:12] <nodist> the only way to check if the url works is something on the server side
[21:14:40] <nodist> unless it has a header for CORS set to * or has your domain in it
[22:42:18] <gurke_> good morning. .)
[22:45:04] <sja_> best book for experienced coder?
[22:45:20] <gurke_> sja_, for jquery?
[22:45:32] <sja_> yes
[22:45:37] <gurke_> use the docs
[22:45:43] <gurke_> jquery is very selfunderstanding
[22:46:29] <sja_> I have javascript the good parts for js
[22:46:38] <sja_> lovely
[22:47:39] <sja_> am very wary of books in general but am offline for a couple of days.
[22:48:00] <sja_> least bad book?
[22:48:12] <Uhkis> ?g jquery api offline
[22:48:29] <Uhkis> we need a more stable bot.
[22:49:10] <sja_> uhkis: tx.
[22:49:18] <Uhkis> http://jqapi.com/ has download link on the frontpage
[22:49:43] <Uhkis> jqapi.com is also way better way to browse the api
[22:49:55] <sja_> just the ticket.
[23:01:17] <toomus> hi all
[23:03:26] <ProLoser> anyone ever use this plugin? https://github.com/podio/jquery-mentions-input
[23:04:39] <toomus> I have list with variale number of items, and I need to hide last item afret 10 seconds. The problem is, that sometimes when elements appear immediatelly one after another, they hide together. I mean it looks like they hide together.
[23:05:07] <toomus> How to make hide sequentially?
[23:05:27] <ProLoser> what you're saying doesn't make sense
[23:05:51] <toomus> ProLoser: THX :P
[23:06:42] <ProLoser> explain better
[23:08:14] <toomus> ProLoser: https://jsfiddle.net/7u5a82tr/
[23:08:25] <toomus> Add few notifies
[23:12:17] <toomus> ProLoser: Do you see the prolem?
[23:25:34] <Cork> toomus: you would have to use the complete callback from the previous hide to delay the timer
[23:26:04] <Cork> meaning 10 second > start hide animation > wait for animation to complete > start the next 10 sec timer
[23:26:22] <toomus> Cork: what you think about  queue()?
[23:26:32] <Cork> toomus: queue is per element
[23:26:37] <Cork> so it doesn't help you here
[23:33:46] <toomus> Cork: thx for suggestions
[23:42:10] <hellyeah> sup
