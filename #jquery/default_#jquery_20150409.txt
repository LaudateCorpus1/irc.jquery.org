[00:19:01] <cyberbrai> How can i convert the image into byte array and byte array to image
[00:21:25] <Uhkis> hellier: is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/bpnhoq0L/
[00:23:00] <kokut> var has_slider = ($('.ms-container').length) ? true : false; console.log(has_slider); // Throws false on my website but true on my chrome console, WTF?
[00:23:31] <Cork> kokut: just do var has_slider $('.ms-container').length > 0
[00:23:35] <Cork> opps
[00:23:39] <Cork> kokut: just do var has_slider = $('.ms-container').length > 0
[00:23:53] <Cork> kokut: and it might be you're doing it before the element is added
[00:24:31] <kokut> Cork: yea maybe it's that
[00:24:57] <kokut> keeps throwing false
[00:25:06] <Cork> it isn't throwing
[00:25:27] <Cork> throwing would mean you get an exception, and i doubt that
[00:25:58] <kokut> i'm using it for exception handling, its my own throw :)
[00:26:30] <Cork> you throw the value of a boolean?!?
[00:29:04] <Kartagis> what am I doing wrong on line #6 in http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xwzwe7af/ ?
[00:30:03] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/xwzwe7af/1/
[00:30:20] <Cork> like i said yesterday you can't use the object method as it will follow the spec and escape /
[00:34:10] <Kartagis> Cork: I tried that, but this time <space> won't convert to +
[00:34:28] <Cork> Kartagis: your writing the params by hand
[00:34:34] <Cork> it doesn't convert anything by default
[00:34:49] <Cork> if you want something converted you have to convert it
[00:35:02] <Kartagis> data: "q=search/node/" + $("#search-txt").val().replace(/%20/g, '+'),
[00:35:11] <Kartagis> I did this too
[00:57:15] <Omar-> good morning
[01:23:04] <garethdaine> Folks, I have this code http://kopy.io/6srjM
[01:24:12] <garethdaine> When a user clicks the .add-delegate button it adds form controls to a the #booking-form that allows them to add delegates to an event. When a user clicks ‘.remove-delegate’ it removes those controls.
[01:25:29] <garethdaine> The problem I am facing is that when a user clicks to add a delegate and then clicks .summary, all works great. But if they go back and remove the delegate (essentially removing teh form controls) and then continues to the summary the data for the removed delegate is still posted with $('#booking-form').serialize();
[01:26:13] <garethdaine> What am I doing wrong here? How come it won’t post the form again without the delegate data when it’s removed
[01:26:20] <garethdaine> It’s like it’s being cached somewhere
[01:27:12] <Cork> garethdaine: that would mean the elements is still in the form
[01:27:21] <Cork> there isn't a cache
[01:27:28] <garethdaine> Cork: It’s not mate, I’ve double checked several times
[01:27:46] <garethdaine> When the remove-delegate button is clicke3d, the form controls are removed from teh dom
[01:27:49] <Cork> garethdaine: it has to, else you can't get the effect you're seeing
[01:27:58] <Cork> try to reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[01:28:08] <garethdaine> You would think not but the controls are definitely not there, I’ve checked and checked
[01:28:19] <Cork> garethdaine: they have to
[01:29:01] <Cork> or you're looking at something other then $('#booking-form').serialize();
[01:29:34] <garethdaine> Just tested it and the controls are completely removed in the dom
[01:29:44] <Cork> make a jsfiddle showing the effect
[01:30:10] <tirengarfio> Cork, I finally wrote the method to not call twice canvasAreaDraw. My problem now is about resetting the points varaible, that is: now I have two input files, so when I preview an image for the second input file, the points of the first one image are also resetted.. http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/LvsYc/5606/
[01:30:23] <garethdaine> I can’t mate, it’s far too complex to do that and requires lots of AJAX calls mate
[01:30:43] <Cork> garethdaine: then you have to look into where the elements you find with $('#booking-form').serialize();
[01:30:52] <Cork> and why they aren't removed from the dom
[01:31:05] <Cork> or if you use a global variable or something like that
[01:31:19] <Cork> but what you describe can't happen
[01:31:36] <garethdaine> Cork: I’ve checked the $(‘#bookingform’) in the console, and they are not there but as soon as you check $('#booking-form').serialize(); in the console, the data is there
[01:32:28] <garethdaine> But it shouldn’t serialize the form until summary is clicked
[01:32:31] <Cork> garethdaine: i can't help you find what element you get that breaks the code, without a demo, but again there has to be either 1. a global variable you use instead of .serialize()
[01:32:40] <Cork> or 2. you remove something other then what you think you are
[01:33:11] <Cork> .serialize walks the dom, it has no cache
[01:33:16] <Cork> i can't find what isn't there
[01:33:18] <garethdaine> I can give youy a link to the staging site where you can see the effect if that helps
[01:33:33] <Cork> sure
[01:33:52] <garethdaine> Thanks, give me 2 secs
[01:35:44] <Cork> tirengarfio: the page still doesn't support changing the image
[01:35:51] <Cork> or rather the plugin still doesn't
[01:36:17] <Kartagis> sooo
[01:36:17] <Cork> tirengarfio: you can't really extend it to do that, you would largely have to rewrite it
[01:36:28] <garethdaine> Cork: If you go here http://purplegriffon.net/booking/create?eventId=2058
[01:36:34] <Kartagis> Cork: I also did data: "q=search/node/" + $("#search-txt").val().replace(/%20/g, '+'),
[01:36:47] <garethdaine> And enter the credentials admin Kq3IWRx9OcCrw
[01:37:00] <tirengarfio> for me, the image is is changing after opening a file, is not working for you?
[01:37:04] <tirengarfio> im on firefox
[01:37:41] <Cork> tirengarfio: the image change, but the plugin still can't handle it
[01:37:52] <garethdaine> Cork: This is the JS http://kopy.io/6srjM
[01:38:05] <Cork> garethdaine: what is the str?
[01:38:33] <garethdaine> str?
[01:38:43] <Cork> Step To Reproduce
[01:38:56] <garethdaine> Ah OK, Go through the form until you get to delegates
[01:38:57] <Cork> *Steps
[01:39:06] <garethdaine> Add a delegate and click next/summary
[01:39:16] <garethdaine> Then go back and remove the delegate
[01:39:22] <Cork> it fails at the first next step
[01:39:27] <garethdaine> You can then check the dom to make sure it’s been removed
[01:39:31] <Cork> and i get a validation error from an none existing element
[01:39:51] <garethdaine> Then click summary again and the delegate will be rememberewd
[01:39:54] <Cork> (the overlay points to 0x0 on the screen)
[01:40:00] <garethdaine> Cork: What do you mean
[01:40:17] <Cork> 1. i fill the 5 form fields
[01:40:21] <Cork> 2. i click next
[01:40:43] <Cork> result: i get "Please fill out this field" from the top left corner of the page
[01:41:03] <garethdaine> Odd, what browser is that ?
[01:41:17] <Cork> ah, not i see what happens
[01:41:27] <garethdaine> Can you do a hard refresh and see if that sorts it. I know you’ve never been to the site before but worth a try
[01:45:09] <Cork> garethdaine: did a $('#booking-form').serializeArray() and when the delegations are gone it doesn't include them
[01:45:14] <Cork> so ya, can't reproduce
[01:45:45] <garethdaine> But did you see the issue I mean
[01:45:49] <Cork> though your counter for the delegates[index] doesn't reset
[01:46:07] <garethdaine> Yeah, no need to reset that really
[01:46:48] <Cork> i get an "The email format is invalid" but it doesn't say what email (there has been several of them)
[01:47:39] <garethdaine> Probably best to use a real email, as long as you don’t confirm the booking it won’t save it
[01:48:18] <garethdaine> It will be the delegate email no doubt
[01:48:37] <Cork> ah, you have different email validators for different steps
[01:48:43] <garethdaine> Yes
[01:48:43] <Cork> might want to make them the same
[01:49:02] <Cork> first validating and later giving an error for the same field is confusing
[01:49:06] <garethdaine> Sure, I also need to take them to the correct step that has the error, haven’t sorted that yet
[01:49:36] <Cork> anyway, you're problem is that you never reset the summary
[01:50:03] <garethdaine> Hmm, in what way. I run the AJAX post on every summary click
[01:51:29] <Cork> #summary .span12 .row-fluid ul li input[name="delegates[4][first_name]"]
[01:51:46] <Cork> that is where the delegates in the serialize comes from
[01:53:09] <garethdaine> Ah, frigging hell. I see where you mean
[01:53:36] <garethdaine> So when the summary is clicked again, I need to empty that dom element
[01:54:00] <Cork> or not add the input field there
[01:54:25] <Cork> haven't dug deeper into where they come from
[01:55:08] <garethdaine> They need to be there at the moment but I’’l look in to tidying that up later. Thanks for the fresh pair of eyes on this and the help
[01:55:29] <Cork> garethdaine: a tip: use serializeArray
[01:55:34] <Cork> for debugging
[01:55:56] <Cork> then if you find something that shouldn't be there use $('[name="<the-field-name>"')
[01:56:04] <Cork> run that in the console
[01:56:11] <Cork> then just click the element to jump to it in the dom view
[01:56:11] <garethdaine> Thank you
[01:56:18] <Cork> it makes it easy to see where it comes from
[01:56:23] <garethdaine> That is a great tip I never knew about
[01:56:39] <garethdaine> Changed the code now and it works, thanks mate
[01:57:38] <pramodxyle> i have like a thing...i need to make continuos ajax calls to a backend webserver running node js..so, its like 5 different ajax api calls with each having a setinterval of 10 seconds..
[01:57:44] <pramodxyle> but the browser hangs !
[01:57:55] <pramodxyle> so, what i've done is
[01:58:03] <pramodxyle> used visibility api
[01:58:19] <pramodxyle> to stop the processes (interval) when not is focus
[01:58:29] <pramodxyle> is there any other better solution to this ?
[01:58:51] <Cork> pramodxyle: to start with never ever use setInterval for network calls
[01:59:08] <Cork> use setTimeout and request a new timeout on success/complete
[01:59:32] <Cork> cause if the network gets slow, or the user puts the computer to sleep or the server gets overloaded or...
[01:59:42] <Cork> you will queue up calls, and will ddos your self
[01:59:53] <Cork> not a grate thing :)
[02:00:12] <pramodxyle> yes i did that..the result is almost the same..i have a beter solution as well..using web sockets..which would be pretty cool..
[02:00:15] <Cork> secondly make sure you don't use sync ajax calls, as that will freeze the browser for the same reason
[02:00:25] <pramodxyle> yep, thats right
[02:00:32] <Cork> thirdly make sure you don't do a bunch of dom modifications in a loop
[02:00:33] <pramodxyle> set to async true
[02:00:51] <Cork> work the new elements and build s set BEFORE you attach them to the dom
[02:00:56] <Cork> then make that in one go
[02:01:12] <Cork> and forth check so you don't run long loops
[02:01:20] <Cork> that should fix your problems
[02:01:37] <pramodxyle> yep, will try out that..
[02:02:30] <Cork> pramodxyle: and no setInterval is not in anyway similar to setTimeout
[02:02:50] <Cork> setInterval will tick every interval time, not matter if the code can keep up
[02:03:01] <Cork> the new call will just be put at the end of the queue
[02:03:17] <Cork> so if you for some reason miss one or two beets
[02:03:23] <Cork> you will start to constantly run the code
[02:03:43] <Cork> and that is why you should be very VERY careful with setInterval
[02:03:59] <Cork> (personally i basically never use it for this reason)
[02:04:22] <pramodxyle> yeah thats right..what do you think of web sockets..i have web sockets..so, there is no pull, its always push..
[02:04:34] <Cork> i use websocket my self
[02:04:56] <Cork> and ya it removes the need for polling and if you can make a server that supports it it is a sweet solution
[02:05:01] <pramodxyle> but is there a way to create channels in web sockets?
[02:05:06] <pramodxyle> as in
[02:05:15] <Cork> channels?
[02:05:20] <Cork> for what?
[02:05:30] <Cork> you just push what ever data you want over it
[02:05:41] <Cork> and how you identify where this data should go is up to you
[02:05:52] <Cork> personally i just use json
[02:05:57] <Cork> with an action key
[02:06:07] <pramodxyle> as in ?
[02:06:11] <Cork> app.actions[event.action](event)
[02:06:48] <Cork> and then each function get the data it needs
[02:07:47] <lindylex> I am trying to change the anchor tag color for link that are created dynamically use the following $('#theCopyId').find('a').addClass('antagonymsLinks');  But it does nothing to the links color.
[02:08:40] <Cork> lindylex: you would have to run that script again for every time you add a new link
[02:09:05] <Cork> lindylex: a better option might be to do this with a css rule instead
[02:09:43] <pramodxyle> ok got it..you know..if you think of it..what if u had a channel and you could subscribe to it and the web socket would contibuosly broadcast to that channel..socket io works the same way
[02:09:46] <pramodxyle> but from a client
[02:09:57] <pramodxyle> if there was a way to "subscribe"
[02:10:09] <lindylex> i do not understand this is what I have.  http://pastebin.com/9KHPRqBj
[02:10:22] <Cork> pramodxyle: websocket is just that a socket
[02:10:26] <lindylex> Cork: http://pastebin.com/9KHPRqBj
[02:10:35] <Cork> pramodxyle: what you push over it, is completely independent
[02:11:27] <Cork> lindylex: you have to run the code 12-15 inside the post callback
[02:11:33] <Cork> else it will run before the new elements exist
[02:11:48] <lindylex> Cork how do I do this?
[02:11:55] <Cork> uh, move the lines?
[02:12:01] <Cork> you already have the callback
[02:13:29] <lindylex> Cork: I see place it at the end of the post
[02:13:46] <Cork> end of the callback function
[02:13:48] <Cork> not the post
[02:18:07] <lindylex> Cork: In this "function(data, status){"
[02:18:13] <Cork> yes
[02:19:03] <lindylex> Thanks
[02:47:25] <furoido> ive hide some options using  $('#home_team option[value=125]').hide();
[02:47:42] <furoido> how do i show all the hidden options?
[02:47:59] <Cork> furoido: display: none doesn't work in all browsers
[02:48:11] <Cork> for option that is
[02:48:30] <Cork> to be precise i'm quite sure it doesn't work in webkit/blink
[02:48:49] <furoido> uhm, browser compatibility doesnt matter for now
[02:49:07] <furoido> or it may matter, i havent tried running in mobile yet
[02:49:08] <Cork> well if you might need it in the future you might want to go a different route
[02:49:20] <Cork> as this one can't be adjusted to support other then basically firefox
[02:49:29] <furoido> ok, but how do i .show everything?
[02:49:45] <furoido> well, im using chrome and it works just fine
[02:49:49] <Cork> in firefox you could just do .show() on the option again
[02:50:11] <Cork> on webkit/blink and possibly trident it will always show, and with no difference
[02:50:24] <furoido> I mean, hide all those hidden options using that method
[02:50:37] <furoido> i tried this $('#home_team option').show();
[02:50:39] <Cork> yes, and like i said it is far from cross browser
[02:50:44] <furoido> but it doesnt work.
[02:50:47] <Cork> you should use a different method
[02:50:50] <furoido> i should work?
[02:50:53] <Cork> no
[02:51:05] <Cork> options and select is replaced elements
[02:51:14] <Cork> it doesn't follow the normal css/dom rules
[02:51:20] <furoido> :O
[02:51:32] <Cork> instead make a copy of the elements in the select
[02:51:36] <Cork> and remove the ones you don't want to show
[02:51:45] <Cork> and when you want them back replace the content
[02:51:52] <Cork> sadly that is the only compatible way to do it
[02:52:23] <furoido> ok, i thought theres a shortcut
[02:52:25] <furoido> thanks Cork
[02:52:28] <Cork> (well you could have multiple dropdowns and only show one and so on)
[02:52:40] <Cork> furoido: there is, but it is far from web compatible
[02:53:14] <Cork> meaning there are shortcuts that works in some browsers but break badly in the rest
[03:22:36] <PCatinean> What if one wants a error message to be displayed somewhere else in Jquery validator?
[03:22:39] <PCatinean> But just for one field?
[03:27:30] <PCatinean> Any1?
[03:30:14] <Cork> PCatinean: if i remember correctly they have a callback solution for validation errors where you can do what you want
[03:30:27] <Cork> but ya, i'm not a big user of validator so not sure
[03:32:40] <PCatinean> Cork, they do but it applies for all elements in the form
[03:33:08] <Cork> hmm, you could check for what element the validation is i guess
[03:35:06] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
[03:35:14] <Cork> scroll down to "group" and you have an example
[03:35:28] <Cork> *groups
[03:39:52] <mento> hey guys, i've got a JSON file on my server - i want to pass it to an array in my jQuery script: but cant figure out how
[03:39:59] <mento> my JSON contains: ['Barcelona','Manchester','Rome','Paris','Munchen']
[03:40:16] <Cork> mento: just make an ajax call for the content
[03:40:24] <Cork> if the server is configured correctly it should just work
[03:40:49] <KnightsOfNi> Anyone know how to get rid of this in the chrome developer tools: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help
[03:40:52] <KnightsOfNi> it shows every single time
[03:40:56] <Cork> mento: $.get('/url/path.json', function(data) { data[0] });
[03:41:17] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: don't use sync ajax
[03:41:21] <mento> i want it to look as following: { value: "Barcelona", data: "Barcelona" },{etc},{etc}
[03:41:26] <Uhkis> KnightsOfNi: by using ajax correctly ;-)
[03:41:46] <PCatinean> Cork, and I assume those are the field names? what happens when they are dynamic
[03:41:47] <KnightsOfNi> it says it originates in the jquery source
[03:41:54] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: sync ajax is strongly discouraged for a good reason
[03:42:04] <KnightsOfNi> jquery.min.js:4
[03:42:08] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: ya, cause you tell it to use sync
[03:42:17] <Cork> by giving it async: false
[03:42:32] <KnightsOfNi> not sure where I did that
[03:42:40] <KnightsOfNi> but I must have had a good reason
[03:42:54] <Cork> no, you most likely just wanted a quick fix
[03:43:17] <Cork> there is very few good reasons to use sync ajax (and even when one can argue for them it is still mostly a bad idea)
[03:43:31] <Uhkis> i once used it as a quick fix, then i realized it makes no sense whatsoever
[03:43:35] <KnightsOfNi> let me check
[03:43:53] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: sync ajax can freeze the users browser for very VERY long times
[03:43:55] <KnightsOfNi> it seems to originate from verify.notify.js
[03:43:57] <KnightsOfNi> a library
[03:43:59] <Cork> it is a horrible idea
[03:44:12] <Cork> time to either patch or throw away then
[03:44:16] <KnightsOfNi> and uploadifive.min.js
[03:44:39] <KnightsOfNi> asyncTest:function(e){e.prompt(e.field,"Please wait...")
[03:44:50] <KnightsOfNi> dunny wtf that is doing there
[03:44:53] <Cork> no
[03:45:08] <Uhkis> KnightsOfNi: you have ajaxSetup somewhere saying async: false;
[03:45:10] <Cork> the option is "async: false" or "async:false"
[03:45:15] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[03:45:15] <Cork> not asyncText
[03:45:19] <Cork> *Test
[03:45:20] <KnightsOfNi> yes true
[03:45:36] <Cork> Uhkis: not ; ;)
[03:45:51] <KnightsOfNi> Ok it's in uploadifive: e.ajaxSetup({async:false}
[03:45:57] <Cork> there you go
[03:45:58] <Uhkis> there we go!
[03:45:59] <KnightsOfNi> an upload script
[03:46:09] <KnightsOfNi> has a  good reputation and it works good
[03:46:19] <KnightsOfNi> so, what would YOU do?
[03:46:20] <mento> i tried to alert the cities data - but it returns and empty object [object Object] from: var cities = jQuery.get('/cities/JSON', function(data){data[0]});
[03:46:27] <Uhkis> Cork: can't help it, it was the end of line :D
[03:46:53] <Uhkis> mento: don't alert, use console.log() instead
[03:47:00] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: i would: 1. see if there is a fixed version, 2. see if i could easily fix the broken plugin, or 3. throw it out
[03:47:43] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: if there latest version still uses async: false, i would not touch it with a 10 feet stick
[03:47:48] <mento> but how do i convert it into this format? { value: "Barcelona", data: "Barcelona" },{etc},{etc}
[03:48:03] <mento> since the json is just  ['Barcelona','Manchester','Rome','Paris','Munchen']
[03:48:13] <KnightsOfNi> let me check the latest
[03:48:14] <Cork> mento: don't use alert for debugging
[03:48:20] <Cork> mento: use console.log()
[03:48:28] <KnightsOfNi> I paid for it, so they better have it fixed
[03:48:37] <Cork> alert is expected to give you [object Object]
[03:48:38] <mento> console.log() did give me the information needed, thanks
[03:48:44] <Uhkis> ^ yet another reason to not use it
[03:48:49] <Cork> basically never use alert for debugging
[03:49:34] <Cork> well i would be fine paying for it, if i could vet the code and get my money back later
[03:49:45] <Cork> cause ya, bad code isn
[03:49:54] <Cork> *'t something i'm willing to put into a project
[03:50:14] <KnightsOfNi> it's a 5 dollar license, but maybe they updated it, i'm checking
[03:50:30] <Cork> honestly, wouldn't bet on it
[03:50:51] <Uhkis> hide the source, ask for 5 bucks, give bad code :D
[03:50:52] <Cork> projects you pay for tend to be the ones with the worst updates
[03:50:57] <Uhkis> best business model ever :-)
[03:51:29] <Cork> its fine if you can demand to ok the quality of the code and modify it if you need
[03:51:37] <Cork> but if all you get is a min.js then hell no
[03:52:08] <KnightsOfNi> plan! gonna ask on the forum what the deal is!
[03:52:17] <Uhkis> heh, they give flash-based free and HTML5 costs $5
[03:52:27] <Uhkis> "html5"
[03:52:27] <KnightsOfNi> ye
[03:52:30] <KnightsOfNi> lolz
[03:52:32] <Cork> :/
[03:52:33] <Uhkis> gotta love the buzzword!
[03:52:40] <PCatinean> wow Cork that was easy, thanks for pointing it out
[03:52:44] <KnightsOfNi> it's pretty old, I bought it years ago
[03:52:46] <Cork> PCatinean: np
[03:52:49] <Uhkis> Cork: kinda perfect example of the buzzword, don't you think
[03:52:58] <Cork> ya
[03:53:07] <Cork> it fall in the same category as cloud
[03:53:29] <Uhkis> haha, cloud is the worst
[03:54:08] <Uhkis> in the old days people just uploaded stuff and it was fine, now it's CLOUD STORAGE and huge hype around it
[03:54:10] <Cork> seams like a modern trend, "use a word you can tell users that sounds good but doesn't reveal what you actually do"
[03:54:20] <KnightsOfNi> oh
[03:54:28] <KnightsOfNi> lol, I'm not even  using that t hing anymore
[03:54:36] <Cork> lol
[03:54:39] <Uhkis> :D
[03:54:54] <Cork> so you degraded your page performance for no reason; ouch
[03:55:30] <KnightsOfNi> Yea i  was loading that library
[03:55:34] <KnightsOfNi> for no reason
[03:56:20] <Cork> ya, loading extra library isn't "good" but forcing all ajax calls you ever make to be sync is... worse then horrible
[03:56:54] <KnightsOfNi> so maybe jquery should completely disable that possibility
[03:56:59] <KnightsOfNi> if it's as bad as you say
[03:57:15] <KnightsOfNi> then people can't make shitty code
[03:57:21] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: it is marked as depricated in the api docs
[03:57:32] <Cork> so they might actually remove it in 3.0 or 4.0 (in the makings)
[03:58:10] <Uhkis> is there a roadmap for either of those?
[03:58:19] <Cork> not that i've found
[03:59:10] <KnightsOfNi> my console is clutter free again
[03:59:12] <KnightsOfNi> yay
[03:59:42] <Uhkis> congratulations :-)
[04:12:07] <PCatinean> Cork, any knowledge if it's possible to make the validator plugin get it's data from different attributes for example use data-min instead of min to get the minimum value?
[04:12:29] <Cork> PCatinean: i would expect it is, but no i don't
[04:12:48] <Cork> search there documentation it is quite ok
[04:13:58] <PCatinean> I googled my ass off and there is no such trace of this
[04:15:05] <Cork> http://johnnycode.com/2014/03/27/using-jquery-validate-plugin-html5-data-attribute-rules/ ?
[04:15:27] <Cork> data-rule-min
[04:21:02] <PCatinean> Cork, nice but that is not a custom attribute hence they do not support it
[04:21:25] <Cork> PCatinean: i can't say; like i said i don't use it
[04:24:38] <Kartagis> okay, in http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xwzwe7af/7/ success: function(data) {alert(data); should print returned data if anything anything returns, right?
[04:25:06] <Cork> if the call is http 2xx yes
[04:25:13] <Kartagis> Cork: by the way, this works as is. there is no need to replace
[04:25:21] <Cork> set an error handler to handle the error cases
[04:25:48] <Kartagis> Cork: I build this into my cordova project, and I run it, but nothing
[04:25:50] <Cork> Kartagis: it was you who said you needed to revert the escape
[04:26:19] <Kartagis> Cork: yeah, I never thought to check whether it worked as is
[04:26:24] <Cork> heh
[04:26:39] <Kartagis> it never occurred to me to check*
[04:31:44] <mento> i'm still struggling getting my JSON data into a nice oject as {value:'Amsterdam', data:'Amsterdam'},{etc}.{etc} i just cant seem to find where to start converting the JSON data into this format
[04:32:36] <Cork> mento: json data just means "represented as a string"
[04:32:56] <Cork> mento: if you mean the array you talked about before, it would mean converting an array of strings to an array of objects
[04:33:03] <Kartagis> Cork: so, what do I do?
[04:33:14] <Cork> Kartagis: do about what?
[04:33:50] <Kartagis> Cork: I know it works, but alert(data) doesn't fire
[04:33:56] <Cork> mento: var r = $.map(arr, function(elm) { return { value: elm, data: elm }; });
[04:34:11] <Cork> Kartagis: i told you to bind an error handler
[04:37:47] <brollypop> hey i have a problem with firing an event after changing a checkbox state by jquery
[04:37:48] <brollypop> https://jsfiddle.net/ea2Lt72m/
[04:38:44] <brollypop> i want events that fire on change of checkbox fire even when its changed by .prop('checked', true)
[04:39:26] <Cork> brollypop: code changes to form elements never fire events
[04:39:40] <Cork> brollypop: if you want the event function to fire you have to trigger that manually
[04:39:49] <Cork> ?api trigger
[04:39:49] <b-ot> Cork: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[04:42:41] <mento> cork - thanks for the heads up - this is what i got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/esvgz0e3/
[04:43:18] <mento> but it wont print my objects in the console somehow
[04:52:46] <vivekananda> hi anyone around
[04:53:17] <vivekananda> could I request Velveet a. Sorry to ping you directly but if you have a min
[04:53:33] <vivekananda> shoot he/she is gone
[04:54:49] <vivekananda> stuck with a jquery ajax localhost google login button related issue. wondering if someone can help. I have an ajax post which shows the request in the dev tools as fine but the receiving page of the post gives me  undefined index error
[05:09:09] <brollypop> thx Cork trigger helepd me out :)
[05:14:56] <Kartagis> so, what dataType does http://yayinevi.sabanciuniv.edu/search/node/felsefi%20kavramlar return?
[05:23:58] <KnightsOfNi> is e.preventDefault() not needed anymore to overwrite link behaviour?
[05:24:11] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: it is
[05:24:23] <Cork> unless you have something else aborting the default behavior
[05:24:59] <KnightsOfNi> such as?
[05:25:11] <Cork> another event handler
[05:25:26] <Cork> using return false; (i wouldn't recommend that)
[05:25:41] <KnightsOfNi> why not?
[05:25:59] <Cork> cause return false; implies event.stopPropagation()
[05:26:10] <Cork> and that is something that normally bites you in the long run
[05:26:14] <KnightsOfNi> ic
[05:26:32] <Cork> cause if you ever want to add another event handler for a different task
[05:26:33] <Cork> you can't
[05:26:45] <Cork> cause this script expect to be the only consumer
[05:26:54] <Cork> its event attributes all over again
[05:28:07] <KnightsOfNi> so I don't understand why people put e.preventDefault at the end of the function.
[05:28:32] <KnightsOfNi> how will it know before executing all the previous commands that it should behave like  a link
[05:28:35] <Cork> as javascript is single threaded it doesn't matter
[05:29:04] <Cork> but ya, as the browser get more and more multi threaded, bug do creep up if you put it at the end
[05:29:18] <Cork> but normally in production it should be fine
[05:29:27] <KnightsOfNi> so I can safely put it first?
[05:29:53] <Cork> ya, but like i said; unless you cater for pre release browsers, it should be just fine
[05:30:02] <KnightsOfNi> k
[06:28:25] <surianup> Hi  friends

[06:29:04] <surianup> Please help me I am in trouble
[06:29:21] <surianup> as evrything is fine herer
[06:30:15] <Cork> surianup: you can only close windows opened with window.open
[06:30:25] <Cork> you can't close a normal page
[06:30:58] <Cork> (some browsers allow it if the user set a hidden pref)
[06:32:07] <surianup> I want to close my page
[06:32:11] <surianup> on my local host
[06:32:18] <surianup> is it possible?
[06:32:38] <Cork> what browser are you using?
[06:32:41] <BillCriswell> surianup: not unless it's a page you opened with window.open
[06:32:48] <surianup> firefox and chrome
[06:33:40] <surianup> measn if I opened the the page only that page will close?
[06:33:55] <Cork> surianup: about:config?filter=dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows
[06:33:56] <surianup> I have already used the window.open
[06:33:57] <Cork> in firefox
[06:34:00] <Cork> set that to true
[06:34:20] <surianup> where is it placed?
[06:34:30] <surianup> in my script
[06:34:31] <surianup> ?
[06:34:40] <Cork> no you have to change a pref in the browser
[06:34:42] <BillCriswell> ...
[06:34:45] <Cork> about:config?filter=dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows <--
[06:34:50] <Cork> run that in the url bar
[06:35:57] <Cork> doesn't look like chrome has one
[06:36:02] <Cork> ie does though

[06:37:05] <surianup> what about chrome\
[06:37:06] <surianup> ?
[06:37:15] <Cork> you would have to look for an extension
[06:37:29] <surianup> ok buddy thanks alot
[06:37:34] <Cork> there isn't a pref to change the behavior
[06:37:42] <surianup> ok np

[07:03:04] <marcusdei2> hi guys
[07:03:11] <marcusdei2> can you have a look at this site please
[07:03:12] <marcusdei2> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/#
[07:03:15] <marcusdei2> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[07:04:16] <marcusdei2> I implemented two sliding sidebars

[07:04:43] <marcusdei2> any idea why ?
[07:09:42] <jaznow> marcusdei2, you should check mediaqueries in css, maybe you are hidding them for low resolution
[07:10:30] <merryfett> @media screen and (max-width: 767px)
[07:10:30] <merryfett> body.home.page.page-id-5 #main #sidebar {
[07:10:37] <merryfett> you're hitting a media query
[07:12:33] <marcusdei2> but when i resize the browser
[07:12:42] <marcusdei2> the buttons still show
[07:12:51] <marcusdei2> only on smart phone they not showing
[07:12:57] <marcusdei2> :\
[07:13:01] <merryfett> yeah but after 767px you have the query i mentioned
[07:13:26] <merryfett> alas there is a lot of !important css rules over there when it reaches that width

[08:03:41] <Es0teric> hey guys, i am using the jqueryvalidatecreditcard plugin and I i am currently trying to make it so that the opacity of a image changes from 50% to 100% http://pastebin.com/jRy6YM0J my problem right now is that the current code changes the opacity from 50% to 100% on the given div but when that div is no longer affected, it stays at 100%, i am looking to make it go back to 50%
[08:31:52] <Koopz> okay... i've got a function triggered by a click event $('.page-header').('click', '.search-form', do_stuff()); Can i do $('.page-header').off('click', '.search-form'); to remove that function?
[08:38:57] <robertmaxrees> gooood morning #jquery
[08:40:51] <deranged> is there a way to find a (possibly) parent-of-a-parent of an object without knowing how many levels of parent you need to get through to find it?
[08:41:03] <arthurvr> goooooddd morning robertmaxrees
[08:41:16] <merryfett> Hey, i have a couple functions, clicks, readys, hovers, bound to a piece of html that comes from ajax; the thing is, the first time, the dom elements are bound, but after the first ajax call, i lose all dom elements and therefore lose all js functions. what can i do? i already tried with running the function every 2 seconds but its so bad practice
[08:41:18] <deranged> say there's an input in a div in a div in a div and I want to get the topmost div while I only know where the input is
[08:41:26] <deranged> but the topmost div can have divs above it
[08:41:34] <deranged> (it's got a class that singles it out)
[08:41:47] <deranged> and there can be any amount of divs between input and the one I want to find
[08:41:55] <robertmaxrees> deranged do you have a calss or ID you can target?
[08:41:56] <Koopz> use .closest('.class');
[08:42:03] <deranged> class
[08:42:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ because this is probably what you want.
[08:42:08] <robertmaxrees> .closest() it is then :)
[08:42:11] <deranged> Koopz: cheers!
[08:42:15] <deranged> many, many thanks
[08:42:26] <robertmaxrees> merryfett you want event delegation.
[08:42:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[08:42:41] <merryfett> well on the clicks it works perfectly
[08:42:44] <merryfett> but not for all
[08:43:01] <merryfett> ill give you an example
[08:43:27] <Koopz> that's why you need delegation
[08:43:44] <robertmaxrees> right.  the first round works, but things die after you replace your content.
[08:43:56] <merryfett> jQuery( ".search-wrapper" ).on( "click", "[name='wpv_filter_submit']", function() {
[08:43:56] <merryfett> var UpperCase = jQuery("[name='wpv_post_search']");
[08:43:56] <merryfett> UpperCase.val(UpperCase.val().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + UpperCase.val().substring(1));
[08:43:56] <merryfett> });
[08:44:04] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste into the channel.
[08:44:09] <Omar-> merryfett dont paste here
[08:44:16] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ merryfett
[08:44:16] <b-ot> merryfett: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:44:17] <Omar-> `paste @ merryfett
[08:44:21] <Omar-> lol
[08:44:21] <b-ot> merryfett: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:44:26] <robertmaxrees> and i'm guessing .search-wrapper gets replaced, right, merryfett?
[08:44:38] <merryfett> well, it does once only
[08:44:41] <merryfett> sorry for the paste
[08:44:55] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you're replacing .search-wrapper.
[08:45:12] <robertmaxrees> bind higher up to something that doesn't get replaces.
[08:45:14] <robertmaxrees> *replaced
[08:45:23] <merryfett> gimme a sec
[08:47:05] <Es0teric> hey guys, i am using the jqueryvalidatecreditcard plugin and I i am currently trying to make it so that the opacity of a image changes from 50% to 100% http://pastebin.com/jRy6YM0J my problem right now is that the current code changes the opacity from 50% to 100% on the given div but when that div is no longer affected, it stays at 100%, i am looking to make it go back to 50%
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric "This paste has been removed!" - make a functioning fiddle instead?
[08:47:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah sec
[08:58:34] <deranged> yeahhhh making waves as an apprentice with shit hot jquery
[08:58:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/t86ku6bt/5/
[09:01:11] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric did you load the plugin into that fiddle?
[09:01:22] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i believe i did
[09:01:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing jquery numeric but not the cc plugin.
[09:02:02] <robertmaxrees> oh that's why it's blocking the cc plugin
[09:02:20] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ?
[09:02:36] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/jccnqor.png
[09:02:52] <Es0teric> try this https://jsfiddle.net/t86ku6bt/7/
[09:02:53] <robertmaxrees> https vs http
[09:02:57] <Es0teric> that should work now
[09:03:10] <Es0teric> i pulled it directly from the github repo this time
[09:03:11] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're loading the plugin via http on an https page.
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[09:03:18] <Es0teric> yeah i am aware
[09:03:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to use rawgit for github links.
[09:03:28] <Es0teric> i just did
[09:03:34] <Es0teric> its in there
[09:03:36] <robertmaxrees> still getting mixed content warnings.
[09:03:41] <Es0teric> o.O
[09:03:45] <robertmaxrees> link to the lib?
[09:04:21] <robertmaxrees> and raw.githubusercontent.com isn't rawgit.
[09:04:30] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/ is.
[09:04:59] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/t86ku6bt/8/
[09:05:06] <Es0teric> that should be good to go now
[09:05:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:05:19] <robertmaxrees> same problems.
[09:05:25] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t86ku6bt/9/ is what you want.
[09:05:40] <merryfett> robertmaxrees what you said about binding higher was right, but would you do it for something like this https://jsfiddle.net/jdp8r3f3/
[09:05:43] <robertmaxrees> leave the http/https off the front of external resources, should be //somedomain.com/path/to/file
[09:05:54] <merryfett> all of those dom elements leave and come back with ajax
[09:06:07] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation for all those bindings.
[09:06:19] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(".js-wpv-filter-trigger-delayed").keypress(function(e) { is the only really important one there.
[09:07:06] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees now? https://jsfiddle.net/t86ku6bt/11/
[09:07:36] <robertmaxrees> or that :) i had it working in mine.  p.s. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t86ku6bt/12/ with bootstrap incluided the right way.
[09:08:34] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so first off, you have an error on pageload.
[09:08:43] <Es0teric> ok
[09:09:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[09:09:22] <robertmaxrees> the result object looks like it always exists, and if( result || result !== null ) { is redundant.  you can start with just if (result) {
[09:09:57] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees it still says "result.card_type is null
[09:10:02] <Es0teric> so its not even supposed to console log
[09:10:14] <robertmaxrees> right, because you need to check if card_type isn't null ;)
[09:11:02] <robertmaxrees> if (result.card_type) { should be safe for that.
[09:12:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ahhh i see now
[09:12:08] <Es0teric> right right
[09:12:10] <Es0teric> that makes sense
[09:12:32] <Es0teric> so robertmaxrees  i am basically trying to add the .activeCard class on the item that matches the result.card_type.name
[09:12:45] <robertmaxrees> right, and if you look at the markup, you'll see that part works :)
[09:12:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees right, but the problem is that i want to remove the class
[09:13:12] <Es0teric> on the previous item that contained activeCard
[09:13:17] <Es0teric> because now its no longer the active card
[09:13:30] <robertmaxrees> btw your css opacity selector is wrong.
[09:13:50] <Es0teric> what do you mean?
[09:14:01] <robertmaxrees> .list-inline > li img {
[09:14:12] <robertmaxrees> that's applying opacity to the img.  you're addiong a class to a parent of the Img.
[09:14:31] <robertmaxrees> this is a little hacky, but should give you the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t86ku6bt/14/
[09:33:35] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ahhh ok
[09:33:38] <Es0teric> yeah that is pretty hacky
[09:34:17] <Es0teric> i see what you did though
[09:34:19] <Es0teric> thats interesting
[09:34:25] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic gist though.
[09:34:40] <robertmaxrees> since you're just modifying opacity and it's one element, it's not a big deal.
[09:35:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah... so for every event that is fired i am unsetting it then setting it again
[09:35:11] <robertmaxrees> aye - shouldn't be a problem though.
[09:35:11] <Es0teric> but on a different div
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> you could do a bunch of extra work to see if the current one is different than whatever has that class, but meh.
[09:36:16] <robertmaxrees> premature optimization in this case.
[09:37:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees nah this doesnt require that type of complex work
[09:37:15] <Es0teric> lol
[09:37:22] <Es0teric> what you just sent me that is hacky should work fine
[09:37:25] <Es0teric> unless i need to optimize it, i wont
[09:49:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah that definitely works, thanks!
[10:15:01] <elsurudo> Hi guys, I have an event handler attached to a file input using “on” to the “change” event. Works fine. Now, the problem I’m running into is that “change” event isn’t fired if the user simply drags a file into the input (rather than picking it with the file picker). This is on latest MacOS Safari. Any ideas for a workaround?
[10:16:55] <robertmaxrees> could check with ondrop
[10:17:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing.
[10:17:41] <robertmaxrees> might just be "drop"
[10:18:15] <elsurudo> “drop” does indeed get fired, but the “value” of the filepicker isn’t yet populated (in my tests). so I can’t do what I need (namely, get the filename of the picked file)
[10:21:30] <robertmaxrees> check out http://www.sitepoint.com/html5-file-drag-and-drop/ then
[10:24:06] <rubyonrailed> Is it ok to use some sort of timeout in my function?  I have two get requests, the second one is running before the first one finsihes.  How can I fix that?
[10:32:49] <daynaskully> so i'm having a strange behaviour where if i unfocus a tab (of this proj im working on) -- and i have it animating some stuff in a continual loop (ie slideshow type deal) -- when i come back to the tab; it's like all the actions were queued up "in the bg" while i wasn't in the viewport, and when i come back the animations happen so fast and retarded
[10:33:19] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed i'm guessing you're using ajax?
[10:33:25] <robertmaxrees> and you need them to run in a particular order?
[10:33:58] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Yes, I ended up doing a 1 second timeout and it's working.  I don't know if thats the best way to handle it though.
[10:33:58] <daynaskully> sounds like rubyonrailed needs a callback function
[10:34:11] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong way to do it :) mind sharing your code?
[10:34:17] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't function.
[10:40:18] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/24a6a8af8d258bb0548c
[10:40:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah so you want getPermissions to run AFTER getSchools finishes, right?
[10:41:36] <rubyonrailed> yeah
[10:41:38] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[10:41:44] <robertmaxrees> cleaning this up in some other ways, too.
[10:42:21] <robertmaxrees> eh nvm - i'll just add in the callback.
[10:42:56] <rubyonrailed> Thanks haha
[10:43:07] <robertmaxrees> you should really lint this code, btw.
[10:43:13] <robertmaxrees> you've got some big errors going on.
[10:44:03] <rubyonrailed> Like what?
[10:44:17] <robertmaxrees> undeclared vars.
[10:44:29] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/w45pgjs/ is basically what you want for the callback.
[10:45:34] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[10:46:23] <robertmaxrees> var select = $('#school_' + num); where is "num" coming from?
[10:48:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, http://fixee.org/paste/3ky9yfn/ is valid.
[10:48:36] <Adnauseaum> just curious, how would you guys go about coding the rotating banner-type deal on this site? i'm trying to think of ways to make it work but it's very curved which poses problems- http://elpasoconcretecontractor.com/yolosweg.jpg
[10:48:53] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[10:50:27] <Adnauseaum> oh, okay, thanks for the help
[10:50:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[10:50:51] <robertmaxrees> but carousels are kind of a nightmare for usabiluty and we tend to avoid them if at all possible.
[10:51:27] <Adnauseaum> its not much of a carousel to be honest
[10:51:41] <robertmaxrees> "rotating banner-type deal" makes it sound like one.
[10:52:00] <creativename> sup
[10:52:20] <Adnauseaum> well when you click the slanted buttons it needs the picture to change, so i guess it's relatively carousel-like
[10:52:20] <creativename> can I madd assign to a class type
[10:52:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:52:40] <creativename> like $('.classname').data('id',3);
[10:52:50] <creativename> whoops mass**
[10:52:54] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/data/ tells you if you can.
[10:53:18] <robertmaxrees> the summary is of particular note.
[10:54:00] <creativename> :[
[10:54:07] <robertmaxrees> what?
[10:54:19] <robertmaxrees> "Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements"
[10:54:20] <creativename> store for the first element in the set of matched elements.
[10:54:23] <creativename> no?
[10:54:32] <creativename> for the first
[10:54:46] <robertmaxrees> the sentence says "Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements"
[10:55:07] <robertmaxrees> using it as a getter means you only get the first one.
[10:55:34] <creativename> so hats whats happening for me?
[10:55:37] <creativename> thats*
[10:56:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not trying to verify this in the inspector, are you?
[10:56:35] <creativename> no I used console.log
[10:56:46] <creativename> and the  variables werent always set'
[10:56:53] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example?
[10:58:36] <Werel> I don't think my jquery is loading the xml file correctly.  It IS calling the success function of the ajax .get method, but when I try to find each element, it's not coming up with anything. Keywords on link is a green coloured "Dude!" http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EaBgJv?editors=101
[10:59:24] <robertmaxrees> check out https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[11:00:19] <Whirled> when using prototypes to extend objects, how do you ensure that your prototype functions know the objects private variables?
[11:01:22] <robertmaxrees> it should just work if you're doing things right.
[11:01:45] <Whirled> Thank you for that equally obscure answer. LOL
[11:02:06] <Whirled> I'll make a fiddle and could really use your advice. Thanks for the reply.
[11:02:07] <robertmaxrees> show an example of what you're doing.
[11:02:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:02:20] <robertmaxrees> the "extend" tells me you're doing something you shouldn't.
[11:02:33] <Whirled> undoubtedly.
[11:04:08] <JosefDe> Hey guys. Does anyone know FineUploader?
[11:17:08] <vivekananda> hi everyone
[11:17:16] <vivekananda> if someone answered me I missed it
[11:17:28] <robertmaxrees> i didn't see a question from you, vivekananda :)
[11:17:40] <vivekananda> a while back robertmaxrees
[11:17:49] <robertmaxrees> mind asking again?
[11:20:40] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am stuck with something. on a localhost ( bitnami on windows) I send a jquery ajax POST. I see that the 'request payload' is non empty ( on dev tools). On the receiving page I am getting 'undefined index: code...'  where 'code' is the index present in the request. What gives
[11:22:59] <robertmaxrees> share your code.
[11:23:19] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, okay one sec
[11:23:21] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you're convoluting something.
[11:25:43] <sacho> receiving page?
[11:25:54] <sacho> exact error?
[11:32:29] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/qcer5mvm/
[11:32:47] <Whirled> uggg. I haven't done the presentation part yet, but am I headed in the total wrong direction here.
[11:34:33] <robertmaxrees> well, to begin with, whya re you bothering witha constructor anyway?
[11:35:25] <robertmaxrees> second, read this: (Quit: Leaving.)
[11:35:25] <robertmaxrees> [2015:04:09:11:33:28] * intothev01d (~intothev0@unaffiliated/intothev01d) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)

[11:35:29] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_constructor_function
[11:35:36] <Whirled> why is it a problem. To be honest, I don't know why. I just thought that would be the best way to do it...
[11:36:14] <robertmaxrees> pseudoclassical OO is possible in JS but awkware.
[11:36:28] <robertmaxrees> *awkward.  i tend to prefer a more functional approach.  have plain data and operate against that data.
[11:36:52] <robertmaxrees> if you're really stuck on this pattern, read the link i sent you.
[11:36:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll quickly see where you went wrong.
[11:37:09] <Whirled> awkware is such a beautiful new word. I write awkware usually. I'm reading it now. Thanks
[11:37:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:37:50] <karpuragauram> sacho, the receiving page and the sending jquery are here -- http://jsfiddle.net/e2pug9cr/1/ . the exact error is here -- http://imgur.com/JHkQ0EB,DOikllZ#1 ( two images )
[11:38:05] <karpuragauram> I have to log back in for my original nick
[11:38:15] <robertmaxrees> wtf.
[11:38:59] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda uh, the issue is with your PHP.
[11:44:20] <vivekananda> okay back
[11:44:29] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, is it ? what is the issue ?
[11:52:55] <vivekananda> ?
[11:53:00] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, still there ?
[11:53:07] <vivekananda> can you tell me what is wrong with php
[11:54:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to ask in ##php
[12:05:15] <vivekananda> okay
[12:54:56] <errJS> im using jslint to validate code... and it's giving me an error with the jquery ui slider
[12:55:05] <errJS> i say...  slide : function (e, ui)
[12:55:12] <errJS> and it's telling me "unsued e"
[12:55:15] <errJS> which is true, it's not used...
[12:55:19] <robertBusy> normally you don't lint library code.
[12:55:26] <errJS> but if I remove the e, all breaks, it seems to be required by jquery ui
[12:55:40] <errJS> yes but, this is in my application..
[12:55:41] <robertBusy> it's because of the way function definitions work in JS.
[12:56:05] <errJS> problem is... i have all these false positives, and it prevents me from seeing any more "stoppd 8% scanned"
[12:56:12] <errJS> and even if i say "show 100 errors" it still only shows 5.
[12:56:22] <robertBusy> don't scan 3rd party code.
[12:56:26] <errJS> im not
[12:56:28] <errJS> im scanning my code
[12:56:36] <robertBusy> oh, you'll need to reconfig it then.
[12:56:47] <errJS> it being, jslint.com?
[12:57:02] <robertBusy> i would use jshint, not jslint.
[12:57:09] <robertBusy> and i'd use a local tool for it.
[12:57:56] <errJS> ive already valided with jshint
[12:58:00] <errJS> what local tool would you suggest?
[12:58:04] <robertBusy> jshint
[12:59:04] <errJS> i did jshint already, jslint is better, it points out many things that jslint misses.
[12:59:11] <errJS> that would cause glitches otherwise
[12:59:53] <jsortino> Hello, could I get some assistance, I'm very entry level. I installed a theme for my Sharepoint and I'm trying to replace the generic pics with my own, so I opened the .asp page in Visual studio....the issue is the pics are being pulled from a url how would I change it so it pulls from a folder on my machine?
[13:00:00] <jsortino> <div class="fill" style="background-image:url('http://placehold.it/1900x1080&text=ShareBoot');"></div>             <div class="carousel-caption">                 <h4>Bootstrap framework now for SharePoint 2013!</h4>
[13:02:15] <robertBusy> errJS jshint purposefully ignores some of those things.
[13:02:22] <robertBusy> it has different opinions.
[13:17:37] <danny_denzongapa> { height: ' + jQueryconHeight + ' }
[13:17:41] <danny_denzongapa> is this usage correct?
[13:17:45] <robertBusy> for what?
[13:17:52] <danny_denzongapa> for setting a style
[13:17:53] <robertBusy> because those look like misplaced quotes.
[13:18:05] <danny_denzongapa> jQuery('head').append('<style>.page-header .vc_col-sm-6::before {height: ' + jQueryconHeight + '} </style>');
[13:18:12] <robertBusy> woah no.
[13:18:27] <robertBusy> don't write out style tags like that.
[13:18:41] <danny_denzongapa> i want to write a style to pseudo class..
[13:18:51] <danny_denzongapa> not write, calculate
[13:19:37] <robertBusy> you're asking for a world of pain doing that.
[13:20:09] <danny_denzongapa> well thats the only way i can do i guess
[13:20:20] <robertBusy> why not use percentages within your CSS?
[13:20:24] <robertBusy> why do you need jq to do it?
[13:20:26] <danny_denzongapa> cannot
[13:20:37] <danny_denzongapa> there's lot of things involves lol
[13:20:44] <robertBusy> uh.
[13:21:10] <danny_denzongapa> involved*
[13:21:25] <danny_denzongapa> i have a div with background image
[13:21:31] <danny_denzongapa> now there is a content box in it
[13:21:33] <robertBusy> make a fiddle :)
[13:21:38] <danny_denzongapa> i want that content box to fit inside it
[13:21:40] <danny_denzongapa> dude
[13:21:41] <danny_denzongapa> lol
[13:21:54] <danny_denzongapa> jQuery('head').append('<style>.page-header .vc_col-sm-6::before {height: ' + jQueryconHeight + '} </style>');
[13:21:56] <danny_denzongapa> whats wrong in this?
[13:21:59] <danny_denzongapa> i don't get it
[13:22:10] <robertBusy> it'll fail in some browsers and is code smell.
[13:22:31] <robertBusy> feel free to do it if you want, but it can/will break.
[13:22:47] <danny_denzongapa> why would it fail?
[13:23:11] <robertBusy> older versions of IE don't like having style tags manipulated like that.
[13:23:25] <robertBusy> you're also writing style tags using JS, which breaks your separations of concern.
[13:23:34] <robertBusy> some day you're going to try to change your CSS and not remember you did that.
[13:23:57] <errJS> are these both identical?
[13:23:58] <errJS>  aLabel[id]++;      vs     aLabel[id] =  aLabel[id] + 1;
[13:24:12] <robertBusy> errJS you were just told in ##javascript that they are.
[13:24:18] <errJS> yes but
[13:24:24] <errJS> i was unsure if he was answering me or other person
[13:24:29] <errJS> so i wanted to make certain
[13:24:35] <robertBusy> you could have asked for clarification there then ;)
[13:24:44] <errJS> i didnt want to bother him too much
[13:24:47] <errJS> :) sry

[15:04:13] <claytonzaugg> Can i ask a jqueryUI question here?
[15:05:53] <claytonzaugg> I am making a UI Library and part of the library I want to automatically populate a list of all the public methods in the jqueryUI widget, how would I get that list of functions?
[15:44:12] <kyan> Hi! Hi! I'm trying to get follow this tutorial https://css-tricks.com/persistent-headers/ to make my table headers persistent. It's not working. This is my page: http://futuramerlin.com/test-2015apr09n2.html What am I doing wrong? Thanks!
[15:47:02] <axscodes> hi guys, i have this select field which has event bind already that when you select a value it triggers an ajax that calls for data and populate other fields, WHILE i wanted to hookup my own event triggered on('change') on it so i can do my thing too. How is this possible.
[16:01:06] <rochadt> kyan: for starters, your table should have persist-area not your body
[16:02:52] <rochadt> and the first table row should have persistent-header
[16:03:31] <rochadt> also your class names don't match the javascript
[16:06:02] <rochadt> axscodes: like $(document).on('change', '.yourclass', function(){ //do your own thing too }); ?
[16:12:19] <Whirled> is $(document).on("change", ".yourclass", function () {}); more, less, or equally specific and efficient as $(".yourclass").on("change", function () {}); ?
[16:13:10] <kyan> rochadt, Ok! Cool, thanks! :)
[16:14:11] <rochadt> Whirled: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:14:53] <rochadt> binding everything to document is a bad idea, but when used correctly event delegation can be more performant
[16:15:47] <kyan> Regarding "your class names don't match the javascript", do you mean "persist-header" / "persist-area"?
[16:15:49] <Whirled> rochadt, I understand event delegation. I was wondering if the second nomenclature for event binding had any performant benefits
[16:15:54] <kyan> I thikn I got them out of the tutorial
[16:15:54] <rochadt> kyan: ya
[16:16:00] <kyan> Ok
[16:16:12] <kyan> Thanks!
[16:17:17] <kyan> Oh, I used persistent instead of persist
[16:18:39] <kyan> Ok, it seems to be running now, but the columns aren't the same width as the table, so they don't line up
[16:21:15] <kyan> Any thoughts on why it is doing this now? http://futuramerlin.com/test-2015apr09n3.html
[16:22:16] <kyan> Whoops, closed the IRC client
[16:34:51] <kyan> Ok, I don't tthink that option is going to work for me.
[16:35:02] <Whirled> does $(document).on("event",".class","func") bind the listener to the document not the .class allowing you to dynamically create other instances of .class and still trigger the event handler.
[16:35:36] <kyan> I'm trying this instead: http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/ I downloaded the file, but I don't know what to do with it. (jquery.floatThead.min.js) Do I just include it in my document in a script tag?
[16:35:49] <robertBusy> Whirled exactly.
[16:36:46] <Whirled> robertBusy, thanks. I was thinking that by adding the "class" in the event handler declaration, it was equivalent to binding it directly to the class.
[16:39:47] <kyan> Ah, seems that that is indeed how to do it, I just need to run the javascript from the console
[16:40:07] <kyan> Apparently javascript in a script tag in the head isn't executed
[16:51:18] <kyan> Thanks for your help! :)
[16:52:27] <rochadt> kyan: did you get it working?
[16:52:43] <kyan> Yes, using http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/
[16:53:01] <rochadt> nice!
[16:53:05] <kyan> :)
[16:59:15] <axscodes> hi everyone, just wondering how can i able to attached .on('change',function() {}); to select field that somehow stoping any other script attached to it
[17:04:01] <errJS> do anyone know if I'm following best practices with this 2 line snippit?  http://pastebin.com/ypDiiQ24  I kinda feel like there should be a way to do them together, in one line.
[17:07:05] <errJS> oh, nvm, it works as expected with one line.  I just had typo
[17:16:32] <rochadt> asxcodes: $(element).on('change', '.class', function (event){ event.preventDefault(); // your code here }); maybe
[17:16:55] <robertBusy> that only prevents the default action.
[17:17:45] <robertBusy> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/ /might/ work.
[17:18:19] <rochadt> ah I see
[17:19:01] <devster31> how do I know when to use $(document).width() vs $(document).innerWidth()? I found out chrome computes the scrollbar width when calculating media queries triggers but does not include that size in the width() think, only in the innerWidth()
[17:19:53] <rochadt> robertBusy: if you don't want any other events to fire, shouldn't you $(el).off('change').on('change'... ?
[17:19:58] <rochadt> or is that bad practice
[17:20:30] <robertBusy> i'd argue that's bad - why are you binding other events if you're only going to remove the bindings?
[17:20:34] <errJS> join #javascript
[17:23:20] <rochadt> right
[17:48:13] <errJS> are these identical?
[17:48:14] <errJS> $parent.find('#child');
[17:48:15] <errJS> $parent.find(document.getElementById('child'));
[17:51:05] <rcyr> Both are stupid... the latter being stupider.
[17:51:47] <rcyr> There can only be a single element on a page with a specific id so $('#child') does the same thing.
[17:52:03] <rcyr> The latter is stupider because it does the same mistake... and mixes both DOM and jQuery
[17:52:08] <rcyr> For no benefit
[18:04:39] <errJS> so, if you already have the $parent cached, you should not use .find()  if the find('#hasAnID')  but you shuld use it if the find('.hasAClass');
[18:05:08] <rcyr> Yes :)
[18:05:37] <rcyr> $parent.find('.foo') is good    $parent.find('#foo') is bad because it can only be $('#foo')
[18:07:51] <errJS> i just thought, it would be faster only looking inside a precached item parent using sizzle... but, i guess it's faster to search whole dom
[18:09:18] <rcyr> IDs are a special case
[18:09:25] <jqueryius> Hi, I'm making a web app mainly for use on mobile. What I want is at a certain point (when form is being submitted), for the page to either scroll back to the top or just appear back at the top -- how can I do this?
[18:09:50] <jqueryius> I've tried:
[18:09:51] <jqueryius> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop : 0}, 2000);
[18:10:04] <jqueryius> window.scrollTo(0, 0)
[18:10:11] <jqueryius> location.hash = ...
[18:10:24] <jqueryius> the only one that sort of works is the hash - but it only works once
[18:10:35] <jqueryius> and because it's a web app I need it to always work
[18:15:32] <errJS> I heard this was faster $(document.getElementById('#item'))  and this was slower $("#item")
[18:15:55] <errJS> $(document.getElementById('item'))  rather
[18:41:12] <v0lksman> I have a json object in a textarea and I would like to represent that in a colapsable format. does anyone know any plugins for that?

[18:43:57] <v0lksman> that's just about as perfect as one could ask!

[19:12:56] <jqueryius> does anyone here use jasny bootstrap?
[19:13:12] <jqueryius> <div class="fileinput fileinput-new" data-provides="fileinput">
[19:13:27] <jqueryius> there's a file upload component, and part of it is like above
[19:13:29] <jqueryius> QUESTION
[19:13:36] <jqueryius> data-provides="fileinput"
[19:13:39] <jqueryius> what does that mean?
[19:13:46] <jqueryius> does that need to be a unique id?
[19:14:13] <jqueryius> later on there is a: <a href="#" class="btn btn-default fileinput-exists" data-dismiss="fileinput">Remove</a>
[19:14:23] <jqueryius> see data-dismiss="fileinput"
[19:14:32] <jqueryius> does that correspond to data-provides?
[20:06:15] <Whirled> jqueryius, are you asking what the data- prefix to an html element's attributes? or something specific to jasny bootstrap?
[20:06:31] <jqueryius> I'm not sure
[20:06:37] <jqueryius> is it an HTML thing?
[20:06:41] <jqueryius> or a jquery thing?
[20:07:00] <Whirled> you can add an attribute to an html element by prefixing it with "data-"
[20:07:23] <Whirled> <a data-special='whatever' href='#'>whatever</a>  for example
[20:07:41] <jqueryius> so those attributes are jasny related?
[20:08:01] <Whirled> jquery adds some magic (just kidding) to allow you to access those data attributes....$("elem").data("special")
[20:08:31] <Whirled> it would appear that jasny is using data-attributes for it's internal workings of which I have no idea.
[20:08:39] <jqueryius> ok
[20:08:41] <gp5st> does anyone know of a table plugin that does pagination based on cursors or last values and not offsets or page numbers?
[20:08:51] <jqueryius> educated guess - do you think the fileinput name needs to be unique?
[20:09:28] <jqueryius> Whirled: actually, I added this on stackoverflow about 30 min ago it probably explains it better - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29552278/jquery-file-upload
[20:11:39] <jqueryius> my ultimate goal is to have a reset button, such that I can clear all of the images in one go
[20:11:56] <jqueryius> so I wanted to find out what these data attributes were for before I blaze away
[20:13:52] <Whirled> I think...just guessing. that jasny registers the items you pass to the $.fileinput() method and the data-dismiss= tells it which element to dismiss. Each fileinput will have a reset button
[20:14:13] <Whirled> once the image is loaded, the loadimage button changes to clear or reset...I guess.
[20:15:02] <Whirled> it might be to avoid accidentally clearing all images when you only want the one that the reset button is part of. You would need to manually create a button outside of the fileinput elements that said "clear all"
[20:15:28] <Whirled> then loop through your collection of .fileinput elements and run .fileinput('clear') on each
[20:16:52] <Whirled> gp5st, what do you mean by "on cursors"
[20:17:46] <gp5st> Whirled: either a named cursor or via the last value in the last returned set (this would be supplied separately from the returned rows, and not expecting the table to figure that out)
[20:17:54] <gp5st> named cursor in the database
[20:18:23] <Whirled> sorry, not sure what that means, named cursor....
[20:19:00] <gp5st> Whirled: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/plpgsql-cursors.html for what I mean from the database side of things
[20:19:12] <gp5st> mysql, mssql, and oracle support them too
[20:20:13] <gp5st> they're not ideal of a display table
[20:20:29] <Whirled> is that a jquery thing? It doesn't look like it
[20:20:40] <gp5st> because they don't really solve the issue of memory when dealing with offsets and being able to arbitrarily jump anywhere
[20:20:54] <gp5st> Whirled: "does anyone know of a table plugin..."
[20:21:21] <gp5st> I'm wondering if anyone knows of a plugin that supports them or value-based pagination
[20:22:34] <Whirled> You can find value based pagination, I am sure, and there are continuous scrolling tables that do the same thing. But to access the "cursor" methods in Postgre SQL? Never heard of anything like it.
[20:23:54] <gp5st> Whirled: it wouldn't access postgres directly.  You didn't know what a named cursor was, so I told you.
[20:24:56] <Whirled> you said "either a named cursor or via the last value in the last returned set"
[20:25:24] <Whirled> I said, not that I have ever heard of  since named cursors are postgre sql methods.
[20:26:16] <gp5st> Whirled: 1) they're not pgsql-only 2) it is a seperate scrolling methodology than value-, offset-, or page- based in that the cursor name needs to be sent back to the server as well
[20:29:03] <Whirled> What part of "never heard anything like it" is getting you confused, here. Perhaps someone else can, but i have no idea.
[21:03:54] <jqueryius> Whirled: my connection dropped... I saw your last message though
[21:03:55] <jqueryius> thanks
[21:04:00] <jqueryius> It's working correctly now
[21:04:21] <jqueryius> Final question, hopefully, for the day
[21:04:25] <jqueryius> I have this: else if ($(element).is('select')) {
[21:04:33] <jqueryius> $(element)[0].selectedIndex = 0;
[21:04:37] <jqueryius> is that correct usage?
[21:14:40] <jqueryius> $('#start input:not([type="checkbox"])').each(function () {
[21:14:48] <jqueryius> how can I also include "select" in that selector?
[21:15:57] <Uhkis> jqueryius: you might wanna use .val() instead of [0].selectedIndex
[21:16:33] <jqueryius> using val, how can I set it to whatever the first item is?
[21:17:02] <Uhkis> jqueryius: well in that case you want that index instead
[21:17:28] <jqueryius> what I don't understand is that I am seeing: <option value="1" selected="">1</option>
[21:17:34] <Uhkis> jqueryius: $('#start input:not([type="checkbox"]), #start select') if your select is inside #start too
[21:18:27] <jqueryius> re: the #start select -- thank you that fixed that part of it
[21:21:53] <Uhkis> jqueryius: so what is your problem with that selected index?
[21:22:19] <jqueryius> it's looking like this: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TeC7t.png
[21:22:42] <jqueryius> yet in the code, I can see the "selected"
[21:22:48] <jqueryius> in Chrome
[21:23:03] <Uhkis> well that picture didn't help at all
[21:25:11] <jqueryius> the three select boxes on the left
[21:25:22] <jqueryius> all have an "empty" option selected for some reason
[21:25:32] <jqueryius> when in the code I am seeing: <option value="1" selected="">1</option>
[21:27:04] <Uhkis> ctrl+f5 ?
[21:28:24] <jqueryius> This was when I inspected the element in Chrome dev tools
[21:28:31] <jqueryius> so i think it's a live representation
[21:29:00] <jqueryius> noticing something interesting though
[21:29:14] <jqueryius> console.log(element.name);  console.log($("select[name=" + element.name + "] option:first").val());
[21:29:15] <jqueryius>  $("select[name=" + element.name + "]").val($("select[name=" + element.name + "] option:first").val());
[21:29:42] <jqueryius> it's hitting that block twice
[21:29:54] <jqueryius> and the second time, the option:first val() is empty...
[21:30:00] <jqueryius> i will investigate that
[21:31:21] <jqueryius> thanks for your help Uhkis, I'm still thrilled about yesterday's breakthrough with the switch/indeterminate issue :)
[21:32:58] <Uhkis> hah
[21:33:28] <Uhkis> fiddle would help solving your current problem
[21:50:48] <FrankD> Is there a jQuery plugin that supports rotated vertical tabs?
[21:51:04] <FrankD> or a good way to do it with jQueryUI tabs?
[22:04:22] <jqueryius> DAMN IT
[22:04:41] <jqueryius> someone else had left a stray $(".items").val("");  at the end of the code
[22:04:57] <jqueryius> so all of my code was fine
[22:05:02] <jqueryius> and this bloody thing was clearing everything
[22:13:31] <Uhkis> jqueryius: haha
[22:13:59] <Uhkis> jqueryius: now git blame it and go yell at him/her
[22:22:36] <Chulbul> one of my ajax call takes 3 minutes to fetch data because internally its hitting the apis 100 times, how do I resolve the speed issue. I store it in cache for the first time and next time its takes just 3-5 seconds.
[22:26:04] <Uhkis> fix the backend? :D
[22:26:49] <Chulbul> Its linked in api, I can't ;)
[22:27:51] <Uhkis> well if you can't fix the slow backend, there's nothing you can do
[22:29:41] <Chulbul> Uhkis, ok :)
[22:31:51] <Chulbul> Uhkis, another problem is if i change url from broweser and hit enter, in between those 3 minutes .. browser doesn't load new page, it keeps on loading ..
[22:33:00] <Uhkis> are you using async:false in your ajax call?
[22:37:30] <Chulbul> Uhkis, no
[22:52:32] <sailendra_> hello there
[22:52:35] <sailendra_> greetings
[22:54:51] <sailendra_> i am new to jquery, i would like to ask i am using a one project which automatically assign autogenerated ID to inputfield now i would like to find which function is called or is responsible to for generating id and assigning value to that field how can i find that
[23:07:05] <drei> hi all
[23:08:17] <drei> hi all
[23:08:40] <arthurvr> hey drei
[23:09:44] <drei> After filtering through results, once all checkbox are not ticked how do I display all - https://jsfiddle.net/tcfhe2vm/10/
[23:13:40] <Cork> drei: check $('.tags').find('input:checked').length
[23:13:46] <Cork> if it is 0 display all
[23:17:19] <drei> Cork: Are you able to update fiddle?
[23:17:39] <Cork> uh i gave you the line you need
[23:17:50] <Cork> if($('.tags').find('input:checked').length < 1) {}
[23:17:58] <drei> ok thanks
[23:19:48] <cyberbrai> <video id="video2" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="130" height="120"

[23:20:00] <cyberbrai> is there any error in my video tag
[23:20:07] <Cork> cyberbrai: don't paste multi line html in the channel
[23:20:15] <Cork> ?paste @ cyberbrai
[23:20:15] <b-ot> cyberbrai: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:20:34] <cyberbrai> cork I seem to be having problems with this video player in IE & FF.
[23:20:41] <drei> Cork: you mean else 'if it is 0 display all'?
[23:20:48] <Cork> drei: yes
[23:21:00] <cyberbrai> Should I add something to data setup?
[23:23:52] <Cork> man i really need to sit down and complete my leach flag script :/
[23:25:45] <drei> Cork: I am confused as to where to insert the if statement
[23:25:56] <Cork> drei: after the .each loop
[23:26:05] <Cork> (NOT inside)
[23:26:46] <Cork> drei: basically you want to do the same thing you do with the .hide, but for .show; and only if that test is true
[23:27:59] <drei> Cork: hmm doesn't seem to be working for me
[23:28:45] <drei> ah the if wraps around the each()
[23:28:51] <drei> let me try that
[23:29:46] <Cork> drei: https://jsfiddle.net/tcfhe2vm/11/
[23:29:59] <Cork> i wanted you to think about the problem a bit
[23:30:44] <drei> Cork: You are right thank you
[23:30:57] <Cork> drei: also you should prob use delegate for the tags
[23:32:22] <Cork> drei: also don't abuse the rel attribute
[23:32:30] <Cork> use data-<what ever you want>
[23:33:25] <drei> Cork: What you mean?
[23:33:48] <drei> did you change the rel issue?
[23:33:48] <Cork> drei: first the delegate: https://jsfiddle.net/tcfhe2vm/12/
[23:33:57] <Cork> doing the rel now
[23:34:19] <drei> why is this?
[23:34:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/tcfhe2vm/13/
[23:34:49] <Cork> 1. the delegation is cause it makes the code more efficient
[23:35:38] <Cork> 2. rel is not "attribute meant to store random data" it has a purpose abusing it for other things is bad both for future specs and for future proofing your site
[23:35:51] <drei> thank you so much Cork, you are a real pro
[23:35:55] <Cork> data-* was added to the specs to solve those problems so use them
[23:36:20] <Cork> anything with the data- prefix is guaranteed to NEVER be used for anything by the browser
[23:36:36] <Cork> so it is always safe to store things in it
[23:37:12] <Cork> drei: actually, lets make one more optimization when we're at it :)
[23:38:30] <Cork> drei: https://jsfiddle.net/tcfhe2vm/14/
[23:38:55] <drei> legend Cork!
[23:56:08] <djam90> I'm struggling with how to structure my code. I see people use browserify, AMD, modules, namespacing code into something like APP, wrap everything in anonymous function, don't wrap it in an anonymous function, what do I do? PHP is so easy. Write classes, autoload them, use it. Javascript I HAVE NO IDEA
[23:56:59] <Cork> djam90: javascript is a very dynamic language
[23:57:23] <Cork> djam90: you can write javascript very similarly to how you write php if you want (and many do)
[23:57:39] <Cork> you can create class like structures if you feel you must have that
[23:58:15] <Cork> self executing anonymous functions is normally enough to create the scoping of the variable names
[23:58:25] <djam90> Cork I look at Gulp, and it has these require('something') at the top, and I just have no fricken idea what that means, and should I be doing that with my JS/jQuery code?
[23:58:34] <Cork> but there are several ways you can structure your page, it is all a matter of taste
[23:58:49] <djam90> But someone with not enough experience surely has no taste
[23:58:59] <Cork> djam90: require is normally based on require.js
[23:59:06] <Uhkis> lol djam90, like php doesnt have a million way to do things
[23:59:13] <Cork> true
[23:59:54] <djam90> Uhkis, of course it does :P but I still feel like the modern way of autoloading with composer sets a pretty good standard, at least for me, but with JS, I have no clue...   yeah looking on browserify my example is on there... var unique = require('uniq');
[23:59:54] <Cork> djam90: make sure you run javascript with "use strict"; and avoid using global variables as much as possible
[23:59:57] <Cork> and you should be good
