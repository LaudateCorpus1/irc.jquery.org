[00:00:05] <xec> if value is null, yes
[00:00:29] <xec> if value is undefined it would just crash, but not with that error you posted
[00:01:06] <xec> sasmit87: but unless you can give us more information, preferably a running demo, we can only guess, really
[00:01:31] <sasmit87> 1min
[00:02:11] <Cork> well we can say that the error comes from something expecting jquery ui and not finding it
[00:02:21] <Cork> but apart from that; not really
[00:07:00] <Cork> nice bathing is part of unicode O_o
[00:07:02] <Cork> http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f6c0/bath.png
[00:07:14] <xec> lol
[00:09:14] <sasmit87> yes
[00:09:22] <sasmit87> this is the url http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/careerDetails
[00:09:36] <sasmit87> click on second edit button
[00:09:53] <sasmit87> and then on the pop op click on save
[00:10:43] <Cork> no errors here
[00:11:22] <xec> I got "Uncaught InvalidStateError: An attempt was made to use an object that is not, or is no longer, usable. "
[00:12:38] <Cork> heh
[00:12:52] <sasmit87> so how to fix
[00:12:54] <Cork> works fine for me in chrome and firfox
[00:13:01] <sasmit87> no
[00:13:14] <sasmit87> which version of firefox
[00:13:25] <Cork> nightly
[00:13:37] <Cork> so 28
[00:14:06] <Cork> but i get the same in release
[00:14:11] <Cork> (25)
[00:14:38] <sasmit87> then how I am getting the error..I have to fix it now OMG
[00:15:04] <Cork> donno as i can't reproduce it >_>
[00:18:20] <xec> Cork: you're clicking the *second* edit button, right?
[00:19:00] <Cork> ah, no
[00:19:06] <Cork> didn't even see that one
[00:20:25] <xec> it appears to happen when the callbacl on line 123 of editCareerDetails.js is called, but why i have no clue
[00:20:30] <Cork> so the problem comes from the data sent to $.aajx
[00:20:32] <Cork> *ajax
[00:20:50] <Cork> $.params is the one throwing
[00:22:27] <Cork> sasmit87: your sending a bunch of dom elements to data:
[00:22:52] <Cork> and the serializer is throwing cause it can't serialize dom elements
[00:23:42] <Cork> hasExp is two input elements and placedFw is additionally two
[00:24:17] <Cork> sasmit87: you need to use serializeArray on those elements or use .val() and store the value from them
[00:24:54] <xec> isn't he using .val() already?
[00:25:11] <Cork> well the variables contains jquery
[00:25:17] <xec> which ones
[00:25:29] <Cork> hasExp is two input elements and placedFw is additionally two <--
[00:25:53] <reloadz> hi! I get back this error msg in firebug -> $(...).on is not a function
[00:26:10] <reloadz> I am useing jquery 1.7.1.
[00:26:41] <xec> you're right of course, sasmit87, look at  lines 91 and 94 of editCareerDetails.js
[00:28:42] <jtm> I have a few divs with the same class, they are all hidden, but I want to show each one individually in order one at a time. Like hide() one then fadeIn() the next one. I am not sure what is the best approach...
[00:28:45] <jtm> Most elegant approach
[00:28:54] <jtm> I was thinking queue() but I am not sure
[00:29:38] <jtm> I know I can setup multiple timeouts with longer intervals than the previous ones, but I don't want to do that
[00:30:01] <yonghan> hi all
[00:30:18] <xec> jtm: i was thinking queue too, have you tried it?
[00:30:54] <jtm> No, I wasn't sure if it was most optimal or the proper way to use it. I want the previous entries to also hide.
[00:30:58] <jtm> So it's only displaying one at a time
[00:31:54] <jtm> I could do a .each and fadeOut the previous index
[00:31:58] <jtm> And fadeIn current index
[00:34:52] <jamk> Hi, i keep getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[00:35:08] <jamk> Here's my small code http://jsfiddle.net/sRpRz/
[00:35:43] <jamk> Any help appreciated
[00:36:00] <Cork> jamk: check if($target.length > 0) {}
[00:36:16] <xec> jtm: so you want to 1: show 1st div, 2: hide 1st div, 3: show 2nd div, 4: hide 2nd div etc?
[00:36:47] <jtm> xec yup
[00:37:30] <xec> jtm: you could just make a recursive function http://jsfiddle.net/2evKF/
[00:38:07] <jtm> hmmm
[00:38:47] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/2evKF/1/ (with numbers)
[00:39:12] <jamk> Cork: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/sRpRz/1/
[00:39:30] <Cork> jamk: yes
[00:39:32] <jtm> xec I'll probably need to put more code in there, is there is non-recursive methodology?
[00:39:39] <jtm> and using fadeIn
[00:39:58] <xec> i just used .show() and .hide(), you can do whatever you want
[00:40:14] <xec> and if it does what you want, why look for another methodology :p
[00:41:06] <xec> jtm: http://jsfiddle.net/2evKF/2/
[00:43:03] <jamk> same error, can't read property top of undefined
[00:43:41] <jamk> so it's unable to read the top property of my link?
[00:44:07] <Cork> jamk: offset() does't return a value if no element was matched
[00:44:38] <Cork> jamk: could you reproduce the problem in fiddle?
[00:44:49] <Cork> including the needed html for it to show the problem
[00:46:53] <jamk> It does seem to work now.
[00:47:06] <jtm> xec Because I may need to add code that doesn't fit well in a recursive function
[00:47:10] <jamk> I think the code is conflicting with other selectors i am using.
[00:47:53] <xec> jtm: like what
[00:48:22] <jtm> xec I have another list that I need to fade in each individual element at the same time each of these are displayed BUT these don't fade out also
[00:48:48] <yonghan> i'm trying to use jquery mobile,phonegap with drupal with using firefoc console,i create two js file,i can't get it work in jsfiddle.net
[00:48:57] <jtm> And it doesn't occur on the first element
[00:49:14] <yonghan> i'm able to login and logout
[00:49:32] <jtm> hmm maybe I can get this to work
[00:49:38] <jtm> I'll give it a go I guess :) Thank you
[00:50:30] <xec> jtm: i would probably just make two functions, one for the divs and one for the list. you can use .delay() to get the timings right
[00:51:22] <yonghan> but when i logout,i watch the firefox console,it gives me extra get http://localhost:81/testservice/js/dashboard.js?_=1384306182617
[00:51:27] <jtm> xec Two recursive functions?
[00:51:29] <yonghan> like this [URL=http://s575.photobucket.com/user/yonghan79/media/ask.png.html][IMG]http://i575.photobucket.com/albums/ss197/yonghan79/ask.png[/IMG][/URL]
[00:51:45] <xec> jtm: yes. running independently
[00:52:35] <jtm> hmmmmm So 2 calls to this same functions passing in different starter elements. But I would add a delay() before the fades?
[00:52:56] <jtm> And pass into each recursive call the current delay timer value + some value
[00:53:08] <xec> well, if the divs are fading in, you might want the list to wait the same amount of time=
[00:53:27] <jtm> So it only needs to be 1 function with same timers
[00:53:38] <jtm> called twice
[00:54:24] <xec> jtm: not if you wanted them to behave differently (not hide the list?)
[00:54:41] <jtm> ah yeah forgot :)
[00:54:42] <jtm> Ok
[00:54:50] <jtm> Thank you :)
[00:55:34] <xec> :)
[00:55:58] <ech0s7> hi all
[00:55:59] <ech0s7> i would put img with id="logo_fb" at bottom of left menu panel, i have setted bottom:0; but why it doesn't go at bottom ? this is my testcase: http://jsfiddle.net/zn7gb/
[00:57:03] <reloadz> hi! can anyone answer whay might be wrong?
[00:57:28] <reloadz> I get back this error msg in firebug -> $(...).on is not a function. I am useing jquery 1.7.1.
[00:58:15] <Cork> reloadz: check $.fn.jquery
[00:59:05] <xec> jtm: http://jsfiddle.net/2evKF/4/
[01:00:46] <xec> ech0s7: what does this have to do with jquery? tried #css ?
[01:01:18] <ISDPNL> i'm looking for some kind of navigation like here: http://www.google.com/nexus/5/ button in the right corner, i rather have a navigation instead of just "next-paging"
[01:02:44] <some_dude> hi
[01:03:04] <seutje> hey some_dude
[01:03:42] <guideX> is there some way of preventing isotope from modifying the left of an element? only thje sorting from top to bottom
[01:05:12] <some_dude> on mouseenter in a div (1), I place a absolute div(2) on top of its bottom half.. how would i hide it again on mouseout(1)and(2) but not if I mouseleave (1) and enter (2)?
[01:05:39] <some_dude> I tried giving both divs the same class.. but that didnt work well
[01:06:07] <Cork> sam452: simplest would be to have the event on a common parent and put the event on that element
[01:06:21] <Cork> and then making sure the parent is 0x0 is size
[01:06:50] <Cork> else you would have to have multiple event handlers and fiddling with checking what was and becomes hovered
[01:07:49] <some_dude> this is my code so far: http://pastie.org/8476871
[01:08:23] <yonghan> hi all,is my question oot here?
[01:10:11] <seutje> yonghan: you can't get what to work in jsfiddle?
[01:10:32] <klawd> hi!
[01:11:13] <klawd> $('#some_input').keydown/press/up(function() { console.log($(this).value()); }); <- this always gives me one character less than was input, why?
[01:11:28] <xec> ISDPNL: what's stopping you? :)
[01:11:34] <yonghan> @seutje : i try to run my code there,but it doesn't work
[01:11:37] <yonghan> http://jsfiddle.net/7bwQf/
[01:11:40] <Cork> Klaagen: cause those function fires before the element is updated
[01:11:45] <Cork> Klaagen: use input
[01:12:11] <yonghan> i need help regarding the page won't refresh as expected
[01:12:34] <yonghan> can i put just the code link here like from pastebin?
[01:12:47] <klawd> Cork: .input?
[01:13:01] <Cork> klawd: .on('input'
[01:13:06] <klawd> ah, ok
[01:13:07] <klawd> thanks
[01:13:09] <Cork> or .bind('input' if it's an older jquery
[01:13:14] <seutje> yonghan: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://han.esy.es/drupal/services/session/token. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[01:13:31] <klawd> Cork: perfect, thanks!
[01:13:36] <Cork> np
[01:14:51] <yonghan> seutje : what is the solution for that problem?
[01:15:09] <yonghan> i got it working from phonegap application
[01:15:27] <some_dude> anyone an idea on my issue?
[01:15:51] <yonghan> actually the main problem was this  : http://i575.photobucket.com/albums/ss197/yonghan79/ask.png
[01:16:20] <Whiskey> what is wrong on this line
[01:16:21] <Whiskey> $(.infoViewLineLeft:after).css("content:", "\a0")
[01:16:33] <seutje> yonghan: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[01:16:43] <Cork> Whiskey: you can't set psudo values in inline style tags
[01:16:56] <seutje> yonghan: also, do u have to wrap everything in try/catch statements?
[01:17:01] <Cork> Whiskey: $() is just a way to find the element, it doens't create css rules
[01:17:12] <yonghan> the belowest one got extra GET http://localhost:81/testservice/js/dashboard.js?_=134xxxxx
[01:17:20] <yonghan> yes i did
[01:17:37] <Cork> Whiskey: simplest is to just add a class with the rule to your css file
[01:17:41] <yonghan> i don't think so
[01:17:47] <Cork> and have js add the class to the element where you want it
[01:17:52] <Whiskey> Cork, i think this way may be batter thats why i try to set it in JS
[01:18:15] <seutje> yonghan: why are you returning false on the pageshow event?
[01:18:19] <Cork> Whiskey: well it's not possible; so no it's not better :)
[01:18:54] <Cork> Whiskey: if you really want to do it through js you would have to diffle with document.styleSheets
[01:19:29] <yonghan> seutje: actually i'm learning from tutorial here : http://tylerfrankenstein.com/code/android-app-with-drupal-7-services-phonegap-and-jquery-mobile
[01:19:31] <seutje> `g JSCSSP
[01:19:32] <b-ot> seutje: JSCSSP, a CSS parser in JavaScript - Daniel Glazman → http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/
[01:19:40] <Whiskey> ok
[01:22:34] <some_dude> how would I capture the event of moving from one div to another ?
[01:23:23] <xec> moving the cursor? or scrolling? or are you actually moving divs?
[01:23:56] <some_dude> i want a div hidden on mouseleave div(1) but not if i move mouse from div(1) to div(2)
[01:24:15] <some_dude> so , i leave div(1) but enter(2)
[01:24:31] <some_dude> and i need the div(2) not to get hide()
[01:25:21] <xec> some_dude: you can probably fix this in a cleaner way by structuring differently. could you make a jsfiddle demo that demonstrates your issue?
[01:25:50] <some_dude> xec will do
[01:26:01] <yonghan> seutje : what is your opinion about it?
[01:26:37] <yonghan> i didn't put return false on pageshow event
[01:27:37] <seutje> yonghan: nah, I misread, it was on a click handler
[01:28:49] <yonghan> :)
[01:30:30] <seutje> yonghan: why are you trying to run this on jsfiddle?
[01:31:12] <yonghan> as i see that code must be pasted on jsfiddle,
[01:31:27] <yonghan> i thought that it is a must to put the code there
[01:31:30] <yonghan> :)
[01:34:51] <seutje> yonghan: jsfiddle isn't mentioned once in that entire tutorial
[01:35:07] <seutje> although "android emulator" is mentioned 8 times
[01:35:19] <yonghan> sorry,what i mean is in this group
[01:35:24] <yonghan> not in the tutorial
[01:35:46] <yonghan> *channel not group
[01:36:07] <yonghan> i try to run it in android emulator too,but it's the same
[01:36:51] <seutje> yonghan: did you set up the receiving server to accept cross-origin calls from wherever your sending them from?
[01:37:55] <seutje> other than that, I don't rly know
[01:38:57] <yonghan> i did not set up to accept cross origin calls,as i can get it work from android emulator to connect to my testing server
[01:39:15] <yonghan> it just the page doesn't get refreshed
[01:39:27] <guideX> does anyone know is there a way to add a certain amount of top to each isotope element?
[01:39:47] <yonghan> when i tyr to click the login button,the text in the textinput are still there
[01:39:49] <guideX> or margin
[01:43:44] <some_dude> xec: i fiddled it, but somehow not even the show() event is working here...
[01:43:45] <some_dude> http://jsfiddle.net/xaGn5/7/
[01:44:16] <xec> some_dude: you keep trying to select '.test2}'
[01:45:11] <some_dude> oh
[01:45:42] <some_dude> xec: smarty leftovers, thanks
[01:46:49] <some_dude> xec: ok, this is the fiddle update: http://jsfiddle.net/xaGn5/11/
[01:47:18] <some_dude> i need the .test2 div to hide() on mouseleave .test1 and mouseleave .test2
[01:47:34] <some_dude> but not on mouseleave .test1 - mouseenter .test2
[01:49:48] <some_dude> brb, out for a  cigarette
[01:52:31] <xec> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/xaGn5/12/
[01:58:24] <some_dude> xec thanks a lot - didnt expect it to be so easy :)
[02:00:51] <doev> for what is a map file?
[02:01:54] <xec> doev: for debugging minified js
[02:01:58] <doev> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/
[02:02:02] <doev> this?
[02:02:18] <xec> yes
[02:02:51] <xec> well, it's not only for minified js, as you can see, but that is one of the use cases ;p
[02:04:21] <doev> sounds useful for debugging
[02:04:38] <doev> most time the generated code is unreadable
[02:05:20] <xec> not only that but it's all on line 1 ;)
[02:05:58] <doev> but its the question, if it works with php generated code
[02:06:16] <doev> when I generated code, there is no map file for it.
[02:06:41] <xec> you mean minified by some php?
[02:07:01] <xec> you'd have to generate the map as well, i guess
[02:07:40] <doev> no, code generated by php
[02:07:50] <doev> yes
[02:07:53] <doev> looks like
[02:08:29] <doev> I keep source maps in mind
[02:08:42] <doev> http://datatables.net/ is my todays goal
[02:09:59] <M3kH> Good Morning! :)
[02:11:57] <amitprakash> why does 'a' in ['a', 'b'] evaluate to false
[02:13:39] <jost> Is there a jQuery function that does $element.val('foobar') if $element is an input and $element.text('foobar'); otherwise`?
[02:13:50] <Cork> no
[02:14:09] <Cork> jost: though val works for all form elements
[02:14:13] <seutje> js> print(!!(['a', 'b'])[0]);
[02:14:19] <b-ot> seutje: true
[02:14:47] <jost> Cork: Thanks. I'll write it on my own
[02:14:50] <seutje> amitprakash: not sure why it might, but it isn't suppose to
[02:15:15] <amitprakash> seutje, yeah, didnt understand how in works
[02:16:53] <some_dude> re :)
[02:17:57] <some_dude> is there a way to select a div only if its parent has a particular class.. something like $(.parent > .mychild).mouseenter.function(e){
[02:18:08] <some_dude> or do i have to work with :parent.class
[02:18:13] <Cork> some_dude: sure
[02:18:28] <Cork> $('.parent > .target')
[02:18:37] <some_dude> ok.. somehow that didnt work..
[02:18:44] <some_dude> ill try again.. maybe a typo
[02:18:50] <some_dude> thanks Cork
[02:18:51] <Cork> or do you mean you want it dynamically for the listener?
[02:18:57] <Cork> as it changes?
[02:21:41] <some_dude> Cork - its a product list from a shop like xcommerce - I can switch between 'list' view and 'gallery' view - i need the mouseenter only in the gallery view.. but $(.gallery > .product).mouseenter() also fires in the list view, which doesnt have this gallery
[02:22:00] <Cork> some_dude: then you need to use delegated event listeners
[02:22:06] <Cork> cause the selector is static
[02:22:41] <Cork> $("parent that doens't change").on('mouseenter', '.parent > .mychild', function() {})
[02:23:29] <some_dude> okay, thanks Cork
[02:28:06] <bigbugjava> hi.. I bring data from couchdb Nano to an update form, now it's works with placeholder =   <textarea class ="formtextarea" name="wedcontent" id="wedcontent" maxlength="800" placeholder="{{content}}"  /></textarea>  , but if it's   <textarea class ="formtextarea" name="wedcontent" id="wedcontent" maxlength="800" value="{{content}}"  /></textarea> , it dones't work.. any1 knows why?
[02:28:39] <some_dude> Cork: any idea if this will work in jquery 1.4.2 .. this shitty shop is using it, and i cant change it
[02:28:55] <Cork> some_dude: no
[02:29:07] <Cork> you would have to use live back then
[02:29:15] <Cork> .delegate was added in 1.5
[02:29:28] <some_dude> yeah.. Cork in 1.4.3 actualy :)
[02:29:31] <bigbugjava> Cork you have brain there, lol... got any ideas why?
[02:29:36] <some_dude> shit stupid shop
[03:08:14] <ahhughes> howdy, I'm looking for a slider.. like this kinda thing  http://www.ahmadhania.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Volume_Slider_full_preview.jpg
[03:09:30] <Cork> the bars would just be an image
[03:09:44] <Cork> the rest could be done with jquery ui slider
[03:09:49] <Cork> it's all about theming
[04:00:47] <krambiorix> hi , i get an error "TypeError: data.each is not a function"  in http://pastebin.com/2rz7x6e8
[04:00:50] <krambiorix> anyone?
[04:01:04] <Cork> $.each(data
[04:01:17] <Cork> .each is only for looping dom elements
[04:01:41] <Cork> krambiorix: also remove the $() around this in the loop
[04:03:50] <krambiorix> Cork, how should i loop then?
[04:04:02] <Cork> i just told you
[04:04:04] <Cork> $.each(data
[04:04:30] <krambiorix> ow ok
[04:04:31] <krambiorix> thanks!
[04:04:46] <krambiorix> Cork, and $(this) is also only for DOM elements?
[04:04:50] <Cork> yes
[04:05:43] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks again!
[04:10:01] <sasmit87> Hi all I want to hide one image on ajax success response
[04:10:03] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/T8buV4kLmPktnar85dygxd
[04:10:25] <sasmit87> I tried $("#workExpMsgBlock").children("label img").hide();
[04:10:42] <sasmit87> its not working
[04:10:50] <Cork> ?api find
[04:10:52] <b-ot> Cork: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[04:11:47] <sasmit87> why children not working here
[04:12:16] <Cork> cause you don't have a child with a label parent
[04:12:22] <Cork> you have label children with img children
[04:12:47] <Cork> your selector would work if workExpMsgBlock was the label
[04:13:00] <mink> Hi guys. I guess It's totally stupid question but I cant find answer on google. I need to create object and wait when jQuery will be loaded. So if I using var Foo = function($){}  , var bar = new Foo(jQuery) It will be ok?
[04:13:49] <Cork> mink: no
[04:14:00] <Cork> oh wait
[04:14:32] <Cork> well no, that would just ensure that $ is jQuery inside the constructor
[04:14:40] <mink> jQuery boilerplate using syntax like that, but I cant imagine how It could be work
[04:14:49] <Cork> it doens't work like that
[04:14:55] <Cork> that isn't a delay feature
[04:15:07] <Cork> just a variable declaration
[04:15:20] <mink> So any other idea how wait for jQuery load?
[04:15:35] <sasmit87> Cork: but label is a parent for child img so what about $("#workExpMsgBlock label").children("img").hide();
[04:15:56] <Cork> mink: well if you really mean jquery to load, you would have to use something that gives a callback or event when jquery is loaded
[04:16:09] <Cork> mink: like onload on a script or similar
[04:16:28] <Cork> sasmit87: that would work too
[04:16:30] <mink> Yes I know what You mean
[04:16:40] <sasmit87> yeah :)
[04:16:50] <Cork> sasmit87: though nothing is preventing you from doing $("#workExpMsgBlock label img").hide()
[04:16:57] <Cork> sasmit87: or $("#workExpMsgBlock img").hide()
[04:17:15] <sasmit87> wah..thats nice :)
[04:17:21] <sasmit87> I did not think of that
[04:18:53] <learning> can someone help me i want to implement an is visable check and if it is click on same tab or other tab to close and open http://pastebin.com/M8P094bP
[04:19:14] <sasmit87> so inside children cant we write two elments??
[04:19:24] <sasmit87> like $("#workExpMsgBlock label img")
[04:19:37] <Cork> sasmit87: you can
[04:20:01] <Cork> but children("label img") means from the list of children filter the one of type img with a parent of label
[04:20:19] <Cork> sasmit87: like i linked before .find() would do what you want
[04:20:28] <Cork> so again
[04:20:35] <Cork> ?api children @ sasmit87
[04:20:35] <b-ot> sasmit87: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[04:20:37] <Cork> ?api find @ sasmit87
[04:20:40] <b-ot> sasmit87: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[04:21:43] <learning> how can you check for open or closed state of a tab ?
[04:22:12] <Cork> learning: what do you mean by tab?
[04:22:39] <learning> Cork: http://pastebin.com/M8P094bP
[04:23:19] <Cork> well i guess from if they have the active class you add?
[04:24:27] <learning> Cork: how would you go about doing if active close tab content or if not then on click open ?
[04:24:40] <learning> so it's an if this do this else do this type of deal i guess
[04:25:37] <Cork> if($(this).parent().hasClass("active")) {} i guess
[04:25:51] <jaami> i want to get the city name from this xml file , can someone help? http://paste.debian.net/65599/
[04:27:08] <krambiorix> in a jquery datatable i set my width like this:  <th width="80%">  -> when i look at the source, it shows me 80px ...?! Anyone?
[04:29:08] <Cork> krambiorix: prob converted by the plugin
[04:29:20] <Cork> it most likely doens't support percents
[04:29:21] <jaami> krambiorix, cn you check the xml file . im using this $cityName = $xmlDoc.find("name").text(); but blank value is returned
[04:30:03] <Cork> jaami: try .find('gml\\:name')
[04:30:23] <Cork> jaami: alternatively .find('gml:name')
[04:44:53] <learning> Cork: can you please tell me what i'm doing wrong with the if check ? http://pastebin.com/cE9sDNqR
[04:45:35] <Cork> your checking if any .tab-pane is visible
[04:46:34] <learning> i want to check if it should open or close on click of a tab :(
[04:46:58] <Cork> also your always hiding all of them
[04:47:34] <Cork> learning: if you want to toggle it you need to check it's current state
[04:48:25] <learning> cork yes i'm hiding them because i want only one tab content in a row to be open not all at same time
[04:48:47] <Cork> learning: meansing the slideUp won't ever do anything
[04:48:58] <Cork> as it will never have anything to do
[04:49:18] <learning> Cork: may i ask for an example of correct way ?
[04:49:40] <Cork> learning: then you would have to create a jsfiddle of what it is doing
[04:49:48] <Cork> meaning running and interactive
[04:49:59] <learning> Cork: one sec i will get that for you.
[04:52:49] <learning> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/HUp28/1/
[04:53:39] <learning> as you can se it functions as an accordian and i want it like that but i want also to be able to press same tab to close it or open it not have to choose a new tab to close.
[04:53:46] <learning> see*
[04:53:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> sup guys
[04:54:05] <learning> Rohan_Bhangui: hey!
[04:54:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi
[04:55:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys
[04:55:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> what are some of the parameters that
[04:55:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> can be passed for .on event
[04:56:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> click is one, hover, touch start, touch end
[04:56:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> is thre soemthign for touch drag
[04:56:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> swipeleft or soemthing
[04:56:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> or will i need a plugin to accomplish that
[04:56:37] <Cork> learning: http://jsfiddle.net/HUp28/2/
[04:57:23] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: check the api page for events
[04:57:42] <Cork> ?api events
[04:57:42] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:57:50] <learning> Cork: thanks mate !
[04:57:56] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[04:58:21] <learning> Rohan_Bhangui: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:58:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: i went there here is the issue: osme events not listed
[04:58:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> such as .on touch start
[04:59:01] <Cork> osme??
[04:59:12] <Cork> ah some :)
[04:59:22] <Cork> ?mdn mouse events
[04:59:22] <b-ot> Cork: MouseEvent - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent
[05:00:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork that didnt help
[05:01:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: this is more like it
[05:01:02] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: check the link in the beginning of the summary of that page
[05:01:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events
[05:01:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[05:01:34] <Cork> and no i don't hold all the mdn links in my head :)
[05:01:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> :( no touch drag
[05:01:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol wasnt not even gonna ask
[05:02:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> ? go do something fun
[05:02:22] <seutje> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Events/Touch_events
[05:02:37] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: that would be touchmove
[05:02:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> touch drag?
[05:02:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> or swipe for that matter
[05:03:04] <Cork> swipe isn't an event
[05:03:15] <Cork> it is a combination of touchstart and touchmove
[05:03:22] <learning> Cork: why when i use it in site the slidetoggle gets an bounce affect ? http://andrewjrobertson.com/tecusa/vetest-2/
[05:03:27] <Cork> and some timers and so on
[05:03:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> but touch move is the one i want right
[05:03:28] <seutje> took us like 20 years to get drag with the mouse!
[05:03:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[05:03:50] <seutje> you shouldn't be laughing :(
[05:04:32] <Cork> learning: cause you are cunning the script multiple times
[05:04:43] <Cork> and loading jquery multiple times
[05:04:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me see let me see
[05:05:01] <Cork> 6 times to be precise
[05:05:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[05:05:25] <learning> Cork: that's cause it's inside an plugin that prints it out
[05:05:44] <Cork> learning: well then you need to limit it to the section it is working on
[05:05:55] <Cork> else it will bind multiple listeners to all the different elements
[05:08:00] <learning> Cork: can't i just do bind limit check to one ?
[05:08:36] <Cork> learning: right now your are binding an event listener for each of the different tabs sections for each plug in instance
[05:08:43] <kiuma> hello. I'm having a problem with json parsing: $.parseJSON("{'title': 'livanto'}");
[05:08:52] <Cork> so you have 6 event listeners for each click
[05:09:08] <kiuma> why do I have unexpected token ' ?
[05:09:14] <Cork> so you are show, hide, show, hide, show, hide animating it for each click
[05:09:40] <Cork> kiuma: cause you are using invalid json
[05:09:54] <Cork> "{'title': 'livanto'}" => '{"title": "livanto"}'
[05:10:12] <Cork> or "{\"title\": \"livanto\"}" if you prefer that
[05:10:32] <learning> Cork: yes i get it now but can't i just make it ignore the rest ? from with in the jquery script like if this listner has an object ignore new ? or something :P
[05:10:48] <Cork> learning: why not fix the broken code instead?
[05:11:09] <learning> Cork: cause i have no idea how to make it work outside the plugin :/
[05:11:14] <kiuma> thanks Cork, why singe ' are not supported ?
[05:11:17] <learning> with out printing it multi times i gues
[05:11:23] <Cork> learning: sure you could store a value on the element and ignore the event if it is set or something
[05:11:34] <Cork> learning: but it is just a big set of hacks not a fix
[05:11:51] <Cork> kiuma: cause it isn't valid in json
[05:12:05] <Cork> kiuma: don't confuse json with javascript objects
[05:12:28] <kiuma> ah ok I didn't know. since when I define obects I use single quetes
[05:12:33] <learning> Cork: yes but i'm still learning so hacks are what i can do atm :P
[05:12:37] <Cork> kiuma: and the reason to only allow one string quite is to make it simpler and faster to parse
[05:12:41] <kiuma> Cork: I understand :)
[05:12:50] <kiuma> thanks for help
[05:13:04] <malibu> I'm wondering what jquery people think about theh web development movement to avoid using IDs... From reading tutorials it seems like IDs are the primary way of selecting elements in jquery.
[05:13:06] <learning> Cork: mind pointing me to what to read or try to have it store the element and do a check on it ?
[05:13:25] <Cork> learning: well that would kill clicking the link again
[05:13:39] <learning> Cork: gah :(
[05:13:42] <Cork> cause there would be nothing differencing the extra 5 clicks from the next clean click
[05:13:57] <learning> Cork: ok i will fix it then
[05:14:00] <learning> :)
[05:14:02] <learning> thanks!
[05:14:10] <Cork> learning: so i would recommend setting in id in the plugin
[05:14:17] <Cork> and then filtering the js to that id
[05:14:30] <learning> Cork:  that is way over my limit :P
[05:14:31] <Cork> that way you can have 6 instances of the code without them stampling each other
[05:14:43] <Cork> id="special-id" is over your limit?
[05:14:47] <learning> gah
[05:14:48] <learning> lol
[05:14:51] <learning> no
[05:14:53] <learning> hahah
[05:15:04] <kiuma> \quit
[05:23:53] <learning> Cork: lol i added the id but it has the same id on all 6 gah talk about clone effect :P
[05:24:21] <learning> Cork: need to have it in an single file js i think will look into that instead of doing messy hacks :P
[05:24:27] <Cork> learning: ya, you would have to either send in a value to make the id's unique
[05:24:34] <Cork> or iterate or similar
[05:24:53] <Cork> that works too :)
[05:40:25] <krambiorix> anyone?    http://pastebin.com/vFvNMZH0
[05:40:35] <krambiorix> -> i get the error that tableid is not defined...
[05:40:40] <krambiorix> but it's a parameter...
[05:41:01] <Cork> krambiorix: no it's $tableid
[05:41:50] <kh0d> yup $tableid
[05:41:59] <kh0d> i use $ prefix only for jquery objects
[05:42:02] <kh0d> never for integers
[05:42:06] <kh0d> or strings
[05:44:43] <krambiorix> Cork, kh0d that's the combo  Jquery, PHP , sleepy does... Thanks!
[05:54:10] <_cjm> Hi Folks, can I position a <div> with respect to an ancestor greater than parent?  I need to cover a region which is described by a great-grand parent, but I can't make the <div> a child of that DOM node -- well, that's not exactly true, of course I CAN make it a child node of that DOM node, but then I lose the context of the place in the DOM tree that I really need to designate when I intercept the click.
[05:54:55] <Cork> _cjm: could absolute position it
[05:55:13] <Cork> but then you would have to reposition it if the page is resized
[05:55:18] <Cork> or things are added to the page
[05:55:26] <Cork> so i would recommend actually making it a child
[05:55:35] <Cork> less works and less chance of bugs later
[06:03:36] <_cjm> Cork, Yes.  This is the conclusion I am drawing, also.  But I need to preserve context of a node farther down the tree, so the concomitant question now is, how can I preserve this context of a much lower node?
[06:03:42] <developerjustin> is it a common issue for click events to not work after using .remove().insertBefore ?
[06:04:07] <Cork> _cjm: you could store the reference or something
[06:04:09] <Cork> and id?
[06:04:28] <Cork> developerjustin: yes, remove removes listeners
[06:04:35] <Cork> just use insertBefore directly
[06:04:49] <developerjustin> Cork: awesome. Thanks!
[06:06:25] <_cjm> Cork, There is no ID that is reliable.  I could store a reference, but the DOM node does not have such a mechanism.  So, I'd need to do it in a javascript closure, which might be possible, but I wanted to write the onClick event handler and attach it to the common ancestor of a dozen or so disparate areas of the screen.
[06:06:46] <Cork> _cjm: that was what i meant
[06:07:21] <Cork> $(this).data('reference', $(this).siblings).appendTo('#where-it-needs-to-be')
[06:07:25] <_cjm> Cork, Well, that is what I feared.  The answer to my original question is, "No."   Bummer...
[06:07:28] <Cork> *$(this).data('reference', $(this).siblings()).appendTo('#where-it-needs-to-be')
[06:07:47] <Cork> _cjm: no, either it is a child or it isn't
[06:08:27] <_cjm> Cork, I need to look into the .data() method.  That is a node reference that preserves what I need!  Thanks very much.
[06:08:50] <Cork> _cjm: it is just a way to store js data in relation to a dom element
[06:08:53] <Cork> ?api data
[06:08:53] <b-ot> Cork: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:09:31] <_cjm> Cork, Yes, and I didn't know about it, so you have answered my question perfectly.  Thanks very much.
[06:13:02] <daum> hey guys - anyone able to help me figure this one out: http://jsfiddle.net/brjUb/6/ in chrome if type coca then try to put a '(' in it won't let you, it seems the shift 9 makes it try to go into the dropdown list?
[06:14:06] <Cork> daum: did you forget to add the js?
[06:14:51] <daum> cork no it works fine - you'll see the typeahead go, its when you try to do the parenthesis it doesn't work correctly in chrome, in ff it seems to be fine
[06:19:49] <learning> Cork: i fixed so it's in it's own custom js file now but the script wont work now that it's an loaded in file http://andrewjrobertson.com/tecusa/vetest-2/
[06:20:02] <learning> i named it customfix.js
[06:20:10] <learning> but does not react :(
[06:21:30] <doev> Someone here worked with the datatables-api?
[06:22:00] <doev> I try this example: http://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/server_side.html
[06:22:54] <doev> but when I run a copy from my local server, it is not working. I can see on the console that the ajax communication is working well.
[06:23:32] <doev> I have absolutely no idea what is wrong
[06:24:18] <shoky> learning: it's because wordpresss uses jQuery.noConflict().  check your console:  Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[06:24:20] <Cork> learning: you still need to use .ready
[06:24:46] <shoky> and you're still including jquery & ui like 5 times..
[06:25:22] <learning> Cork: nvm
[06:25:47] <learning> i just wrapped it in to jQuery(function ($) {});
[06:25:52] <learning> works now ;)
[06:25:55] <learning> thx!
[06:29:37] <learning> shoky: yeah i know
[06:29:47] <learning> working on moving it out as well
[06:29:52] <learning> ;)
[06:38:05] <daum> weird why does shift + 9 in chrome trigger the key code event of 40?
[06:38:09] <daum> which is downarrow?
[06:40:19] <daum> weird its the keypress
[06:42:00] <shoky> daum: 40 is the ascii character code of (
[06:43:47] <daum> weird - seems that http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead is just bugged of that in chrome - type 't' in it then do a ( in chrome and it wwill try to scroll it
[06:44:39] <shoky> yep looks like a bug
[06:48:25] <jaami> i cannot get city name from this xml. plz guide me
[06:48:36] <jaami> http://paste.debian.net/65599/
[06:48:56] <Cork> jaami: have you tried the recommendations you got last time you asked?
[06:49:34] <jaami> oh i checked previous chat history but there was no msg in red color. let me check again
[06:51:31] <jaami> Cork, i could not find recomendations. look like connection was broken in my absense
[06:52:23] <jaami> Cork, please copy paste same text if you have access to the mag
[06:52:53] <Cork> ah, it's scroll out of my buffer and i'm to lazy to dig in my logs
[06:53:21] <Cork> jaami: find('gml:name') or find('gml\\:name')
[06:53:30] <Cork> not sure if the last one is needed
[06:53:42] <Cork> i've stayed clear of using xml in js
[06:54:05] <jaami> Cork, thanks a lot. i will check
[06:55:29] <jaami> Cork, the API i ised return xml. if you know a a beter API that can return postal code also then please do let me know
[06:55:57] <Cork> i think google have one that uses json
[06:57:00] <jaami> yes, JSON is good. i will check google. thanks again Cork

[07:42:01] <doev> I get an internal server-error 500 in jquery when accessin a url ... but the url is viewable in the browser. does someone have an idea?
[07:47:50] <seutje> doev: are you using the same method/query arguments?
[07:48:32] <doev> seutje, yes, I copyed the url.
[07:48:52] <seutje> that doesn't guarantee any of those
[07:48:53] <doev> seutje, jquery-1.10.2.js:8706
[07:49:06] <doev> xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );
[07:49:36] <doev> left click->copy link in chrome .... should be the same url
[07:50:00] <seutje> pasting a link in chrome makes it a GET request
[07:51:22] <doev> seutje, it is original a GET request
[07:53:37] <seutje> could be the server is checking HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH and throwing a 500 when it finds it
[07:53:59] <seutje> seems highly unlikely, but if I'm to believe you and the link & params are the same, that'
[07:54:02] <livingstn> Is Hulu using javascript to detect the scroll position and change the header background when you scroll down? http://www.hulu.com/
[07:54:08] <seutje> that's pretty much the only option left
[07:54:10] <livingstn> If so, is there a plugin or anything that can help with that?
[07:56:19] <doev> seutje, the example is from this side: https://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/server_side.html
[07:56:22] <doev> and it works fine
[07:56:34] <doev> I also tried the same script versions
[07:59:02] <seutje> livingstn: it's custom
[07:59:37] <livingstn> seutje: Do you think they just have a scroll event and are listening until it gets to the start of the content div, then changing the class?
[08:00:43] <seutje> there's a dispatcher bound to the window scroll event which passes it on to the rest of the app, I think
[08:09:04] <livingstn> gotcha
[08:18:45] <nafta> Velveeta: you around?
[08:19:02] <Velveeta> yessir
[08:19:29] <nafta> Velveeta: do you know of a simple function or way to tweak or replace the alert box for something else?
[08:19:30] <Velveeta> but whenever you have a question, you should just throw it out into the channel, don't wait for specific people to be around to answer it
[08:19:45] <Velveeta> you mean like some kind of modal overlay?
[08:20:21] <nafta> yes...the problem is..I am building an application that has around 8 or 9 user interactions that should bring this pop ups..
[08:20:36] <nafta> and say something like "congrats, you just earned X points for that interaction"
[08:20:56] <Velveeta> so, you can either create your own modal and a custom function to pop it up with an arbitrary message, and call that from around your code
[08:21:09] <Velveeta> or you can (not advised) overwrite the window.alert function to call your custom modal launcher
[08:21:15] <Velveeta> and then use alert everywhere...
[08:21:24] <Velveeta> i would go the first route
[08:21:46] <nafta> overriding the alert function would mean that I wouldn't have to change all the alerts?
[08:22:02] <nafta> overwriting*
[08:22:04] <nafta> O_o
[08:22:07] <nafta> overriding LOL
[08:22:14] <Velveeta> technically, but it's bad practice to overwrite native functionality with custom functionality
[08:23:34] <Velveeta> you can polyfill missing functionality, but if you want custom functionality, you should create custom functions.. if you have to refactor your code to swap out function calls, you just do that as part of paying down the technical debt of improving your app
[08:23:54] <nafta> I understand
[08:24:08] <nafta> what I really was expecting to do is
[08:24:15] <nafta> to remove the URL from the alert box
[08:24:17] <nafta> that's all
[08:26:59] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what url you're talking to, alerts just take a text message argument
[08:28:44] <nafta> Velveeta: when you get an alert...you always get the URL on top of the alert
[08:28:49] <nafta> where the alert is coming from
[08:29:04] <Velveeta> oh gotcha
[08:55:53] <mikecmpbll> how'd i wrap an element and it's next element? so <p></p><other></other> becomes <div><p></p><other></other></div>
[08:57:03] <NoiseEee> mikecmpbll: http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:57:08] <mikecmpbll> i guess i'd use wrapAll() but not sure exactly how
[08:57:34] <mikecmpbll> NoiseEee: yeah i know about wrap .. i wasn't sure how to apply it to my specific problem of wrapping an element and the next element together.
[08:57:52] <NoiseEee> mikecmpbll: are there other siblings as well?
[08:57:59] <mikecmpbll> yes
[08:58:24] <mikecmpbll> i basically have <a></a><b></b><a></a><b></b>
[08:58:33] <NoiseEee> well the easiest would be giving them classes and using wrapAll
[08:58:35] <mikecmpbll> and i want to wrap an element around all the paris of a and b
[08:58:52] <mikecmpbll> pairs*
[08:59:52] <mikecmpbll> hmpf ..
[09:04:33] <ISDP> i'm still wondering how to have multiple pages on one page with jquery
[09:07:04] <NoiseEee> came up with this mikecmpbll http://jsfiddle.net/W8MJB/
[09:08:23] <mikecmpbll> NoiseEee: hero! that looks like it's done exactly what i was looking for
[09:08:50] <gvo> ISDP Iframes?
[09:09:01] <NoiseEee>  mikecmpbll: great
[09:09:05] <mikecmpbll> NoiseEee: thank you :)
[09:09:09] <NoiseEee> np
[09:17:38] <nafta> hello, I'm trying to remove a DIV when something checkbox is checked...I'm doing it like this $('#markup').click(function() { $(".divtoremove").remove(); });
[09:17:52] <nafta> but when I uncheck the checkbox I would like it to reappear
[09:17:56] <nafta> how can I do that?
[09:18:02] <BillCriswell> nafta: Hide it instead of remove it.
[09:18:22] <BillCriswell> nafta: If you replace .remove() with .toggle() you should have the desired effect.
[09:18:24] <nafta> if I hide it...will I still get it on the form action?
[09:18:26] <BillCriswell> or affect.
[09:18:33] <gvo> nafta and then show() to bring it back.
[09:18:38] <BillCriswell> or whatever the hell word you use there.
[09:18:49] <gvo> effect
[09:18:54] <nafta> the problem is...if I hide it...I don't want it on POST
[09:18:55] <BillCriswell> gvo: Thanks.
[09:18:58] <BillCriswell> =)
[09:19:02] <gvo> np;)
[09:19:34] <BillCriswell> nafta: Oh, hm.
[09:19:35] <nafta> if I hide it...will I still be getting it on POST action of the form?
[09:19:41] <BillCriswell> nafta: Yeah.
[09:19:47] <BillCriswell> nafta: Let me try something real quick.
[09:19:57] <nafta> yeah I thought that...that's why I want to remove it
[09:20:55] <ISDP> gvo: no, scrolling without scrollbars
[09:21:30] <gvo> ISDP dunno then.
[09:24:01] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) Can someone tell me please, how jQuery handles Strings as an argument of the .children() function? Like $('body').children('p').
[09:25:17] <NoiseEee> Kolorbon: strings?  your 'p' above is a selector.   "give me all the p elements that are a child of body"
[09:25:36] <Kolorbon> I know, but I pass it as a string.
[09:25:42] <_rgn> read the docs @ http://api.jquery.com/children/
[09:25:47] <NoiseEee> and?
[09:26:27] <Kolorbon> _rgn, you dont say... I always read docs/google, before I ask...
[09:26:40] <_rgn> clearly you didn't, the page answers your question
[09:26:54] <delboy1978uk1> why on earth would a .click() not work when everything else within the functionm works, including setting the href for the same element?
[09:27:35] <NoiseEee> delboy1978uk1: mostly sunspots
[09:27:50] <NoiseEee> delboy1978uk1: aka if you're asking questions about specific code, post specific code to jsfiddle etc
[09:28:28] <NoiseEee> Kolorbon: did you get your answer?  the passed argument is a selector.
[09:28:35] <Kolorbon> No, I did not.
[09:28:47] <NoiseEee> what answer are you expecting?  how selectors work/
[09:29:29] <Kolorbon> The docs say, that the argument gets passed to the $() function, but how in the .sibling (.children) function, there is just a for loop.
[09:29:37] <BillCriswell> nafta: http://jsbin.com/uQILANIC/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:31:48] <Kolorbon> The syntax of the .children function is: children: function( elem ) {return jQuery.sibling( elem.firstChild ); But where does the passed selector, get "transformed" to a $(selector)?
[09:32:27] <BillCriswell> Kolorbon: It doesn't, just uses the DOM element.
[09:32:40] <gvo> BillCriswell: You have a lot of time on your hands.  I'm impressed.
[09:33:23] <BillCriswell> gvo: Haha I wish. The work I have right now is pretty mundane so I do this to like.. keep me sharp between that stuff
[09:33:24] <Kolorbon> BillCriswell: Ok, but where does it get the DOM element?
[09:33:38] <shoky> Kolorbon: that's not the whole children method
[09:34:07] <shoky> Kolorbon: see few lines above, that key:value pair is part of an array used in jQuery.each
[09:34:37] <shoky> Kolorbon: if you look a few lines below, you see the .each callback which does:  jQuery.fn[ name ] = function( until, selector ) { ...
[09:34:42] <delboy1978uk1> http://jsfiddle.net/8zXaQ/2/ here it is but moaning about POST in jsfiddle?
[09:34:43] <shoky> that's the actual method
[09:35:16] <shoky> Kolorbon: er sorry, not an array but an object
[09:35:37] <hugo_moss> i have an element that will be repeated n times on the page. i want to give each of these repeated elements a class of "classname-repeat#' like filtermenu-0, etc.  How can I attach an event handler for each of these filtermenu's separately.  I'm trying to avoid the same event handler being called for the repeating elements.  I can set an onclick handler, but I'm trying to separate javascript
[09:35:38] <hugo_moss> from content.
[09:36:24] <delboy1978uk1> it SHOULD bring up that twitter popup
[09:37:51] <Kolorbon> shoky: So, everytime, when .children gets called, .each gets called first, or how to understand this?
[09:38:04] <shoky> Kolorbon: no, only when jquery is first loaded, that .each is run
[09:38:26] <shoky> Kolorbon: and for each of those key:value pairs it creates a new $.fn.* method
[09:38:38] <delboy1978uk1> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/8zXaQ/6/ the 'hidden' link works, but trying to .click() it doesn't. wtf am i missing here?
[09:40:08] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: Is the functionality for all these click event handles the same?
[09:41:24] <meanpuppy> hey guys, does contextmenu event work on list items?  For me it only seems to work on the ul container
[09:41:33] <delboy1978uk1> this is insane!  a simple $('#something').click(); wont click! why on earth would this happen?
[09:43:08] <Tingle> Hi, was wondering if someone could check out this rendering issue im seeing in IE: http://i.imgur.com/Ar0SmiN.jpg - the issue is that it doesnt render to the border and there are spaces, even inbetween the elements like account and the envelope. And where it does this is random depending on the zoom factor, but it even exists at normal 100%. Anyone know how to combat this?
[09:43:10] <sacho_> delboy1978uk1, http://jsfiddle.net/8zXaQ/15/
[09:43:20] <meanpuppy> here is pastebin, http://pastebin.com/YyfS7Szf
[09:43:54] <delboy1978uk1> lol haha, strange how it works naturally though eh?
[09:44:14] <delboy1978uk1> thanks sacho_ , hometime
[09:44:24] <shoky> delboy1978uk1: also.. http://jsfiddle.net/8zXaQ/16/
[09:44:54] <sacho_> delboy1978uk1, it's fine if the user clicks it.
[09:45:11] <sacho_> hmm, that's weird
[09:45:21] <sacho_> shouldn't jquery's click() perform the default action as well
[09:45:32] <dasburger> Can someone recommend a jquery popup library or plugin? Not sure what to call it
[09:45:43] <shoky> yea i've seen this before, don't recall right now what's the issue
[09:45:44] <dasburger> something that overlays with a message window
[09:45:47] <sacho_> I bet this has something to do with not triggering off a user's click
[09:46:15] <BillCriswell> dasburger: fancybox is pretty cool.
[09:46:16] <dasburger> Can someone recommend me a good message popup jquery plugin?
[09:46:18] <dasburger> ok
[09:46:30] <BillCriswell> dasburger: I'd call those in general a "lightbox" though.
[09:46:39] <BillCriswell> Think the was the first really popular one?
[09:46:46] <dasburger> ook
[09:46:51] <dasburger> is fancybox free?
[09:47:16] <BillCriswell> For personal sites and non-profits I believe.
[09:47:23] <dasburger> ah
[09:47:36] <dasburger> is there a free one that i can use on my clients site?
[09:47:56] <BillCriswell> I'd just google around.
[09:48:13] <BillCriswell> There's probably 100's of different ones that do damn near the same thing.
[09:48:51] <And1> Hello folks. I need some help please for my homepage (well, gallery-) project. Lets say I've got ONE main index.php, in which my project-structure is defined. At one place in my index.php I want to import e.g. "imports/gallery_1.php" when clicking on a link "gallery_1". When clicking on my link "gallery_2" I want "imports/gallery_2.php" to be shown instead of gallery_1.php. So my index.php isn't reloaded all the time, just this one div changes it's ...
[09:48:57] <And1> ... content. Is this possible, maybe with load()?
[09:49:49] <And1> (I'm absolutely not into js, just some html and css, so sorry when I'm a bit "slow"...)
[09:50:39] <imjakechapman> hey everyone… I was wondering if anyone could lean me in the direction of learning how to structure my code more efficiently with using things like an App module that has multiple vars inside of it that run functions and then calling those functions like App.Modal.OpenModal();
[09:56:49] <BillCriswell> Checkboxes keep disappearing in Chrome. So weird.
[09:56:50] <imjakechapman> anyone?
[09:58:39] <shoky> sacho_: there it is  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L580
[10:00:22] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: var App = { Modal: { OpenModal: function(){ }}}; can get you that desired.. call?
[10:00:50] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[10:00:57] <BillCriswell> rude.
[10:01:40] <imjakechapman> BillCriswell, so what is that Modal thing called inside of the var App? a module?
[10:01:48] <imjakechapman> an object that App contains?
[10:02:01] <imjakechapman> I haven't been able to find any good articles that talk about this kind of thing.
[10:02:34] <hlve> $('#BillCriswell').hide().attr('style', 'display:none !important;');
[10:02:35] <hlve> <3
[10:02:42] <hlve> MAKE SURE YO HIDDEN MAN
[10:03:19] <And1> Can I bind this to a link-element, like <a onclick...>? ``$( "#Test_1" ).load( "/imports/Test_1.php" );``
[10:03:35] <duch_kazatel> And1 - checkout out .on()
[10:03:36] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript Might be able to help? To be honest I'm pretty bad at communicating this stuff verbally haha.
[10:04:01] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function(){});
[10:04:15] <And1> duch_kazatel: Do you have an example? I'm really not into js. : /
[10:04:35] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function(){ /* put your code here*/ });
[10:05:11] <nafta> BillCriswell: thanks, I'll try to understand
[10:05:15] <nafta> let me read
[10:05:20] <imjakechapman> BillCriswell, ooooo I remember this, don't think I was at my current level of knowledge and didn't read that far.
[10:05:21] <imjakechapman> thanks
[10:05:30] <And1> duch_kazatel: And how can I bind this to a specific <a>?
[10:05:34] <BillCriswell> nafta: I was directing that at imjakechapman.
[10:05:47] <duch_kazatel> does the a have an ID associated to it?  is in in a container with a specific ID?
[10:05:52] <nafta> no, I mean that I just saw the solution you gave me
[10:05:57] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: Yeah, that whole thing is slowly making more sense to me.
[10:06:01] <BillCriswell> nafta: Ah, awesome.
[10:06:03] <duch_kazatel> are you able to target that specific a using a particular CSS selector?
[10:06:16] <imjakechapman> I saw some code I grabbed and was using but didn't understand it
[10:06:18] <imjakechapman> let me show you.
[10:06:58] <imjakechapman> BillCriswell
[10:06:59] <imjakechapman> http://paste.laravel.com/17ik
[10:07:18] <Velveeta> ok people, i'll be back, gotta duck out of here to give a presentation
[10:07:30] <imjakechapman> Why is that returning stuff?
[10:07:50] <And1> duch_kazatel: I want something like <a class="nav" href="/imports/gallery_1.php">Gallery_1</a>, but instead of linking to the file, it should just load it's content at another position in my code.
[10:09:25] <duch_kazatel> And1 I can point you in a direction, but I can't write it all for you ;).  Sounds like you want to check out $.ajax() for loading the content, .on() for binding the event, and .append() for popping that into content.
[10:10:35] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: It's so you can call closeIntroVideo, resizeNav and showINtroVideo from outside.
[10:10:47] <And1> duch_kazatel: Well if you say so? Did you read my first question with the description of what I'm trying to do? : x
[10:11:02] <imjakechapman> but isn't that the exact same thing as just doing The Module Pattern?
[10:11:11] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: You can't do like... App.setNavHeight for example
[10:12:05] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: That appears to be the Revealing Module Pattern. http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript
[10:12:08] <imjakechapman> what is this pattern called? If it even has a name?
[10:12:09] <imjakechapman> lol
[10:12:15] <imjakechapman> nevermind you answered that
[10:13:00] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: I don't do enough fun javascript to really use this stuff. =(
[10:13:43] <imjakechapman> haha, I'm going to be using it to clean up my normal interaction js on websites
[10:14:03] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: Godspeed.
[10:14:05] <imjakechapman> instead of doing stuff like if ( $('.my-class').length > ) { // do something }
[10:15:16] <BillCriswell> Seems like a good idea!
[10:17:38] <BillCriswell> Wish there was a quick way to get caught up to speed on a projects css / js methodologies
[10:18:25] <iredmedia> @BillCriswell Good documentation
[10:18:26] <iredmedia> :)
[10:24:11] <BillCriswell> iredmedia: True.
[10:24:58] <BillCriswell> I wonder if there's a fun way to do documentation.
[10:27:43] <duch_kazatel> And1 I just read your first question.  you don't want to load the php itself, but the rendered HTML.  that's accomplished via $.ajax();
[10:29:55] <And1> duch_kazatel: In my words, when I click on a link I want the content of a html-file to be imported to a specific position (to a div in my index.php).
[10:30:31] <duch_kazatel> And1 yeah then you need to learn about $.ajax();
[10:31:28] <And1> duch_kazatel: Are there some examples for something related to my problem?
[10:32:08] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#entry-examples
[10:32:43] <duch_kazatel> the example for "Retrieve the latest version of an HTML page." is the basic gist.
[10:33:38] <duch_kazatel> note that you'll want to learn what all that does and tailor it to your needs.
[10:33:47] <duch_kazatel> you might want to enable caching, for instance.
[10:42:34] <PilotBob> Does anyone know why upgrading to 1.9.1 would cause an unfound error on the mask() command using jquery ui datepicker. I didn't see anything about 1.9.1 removing mask() and I'm using the same version of jQueryUI I was before.
[10:43:09] <duch_kazatel> maybe that version of jqui and jquery are incompatible?
[10:45:15] <ISDP> #bitcoin
[10:45:19] <PilotBob> the weird thing is, the error goes away when I use jquery migrate, but I don't get any console errors at all.
[10:46:11] <PilotBob> duch_kazatel: I expect thats probably true, but migrate resolves the error, but gives me no console messages about deprecated features.
[10:51:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> does anyone know where i can get a vid or gif of the ios7 otggle switch animation?
[10:51:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> *toggle
[10:51:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> not a codepen please
[10:51:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> or if it is
[10:52:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> its has to be exactly like the one found in ios7
[10:55:47] <shoky> PilotBob: jquery ui doesn't have a mask()
[10:57:26] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I've encountered some odd behavior... I have $c which is a set of <div>s, and I have $v which I get from a click event object (e.target) and I know that $v is one of the $c.  So, I expect $n = $c.find($v) to return $n === $v, because $v is one of the set of $c. Not working.  Any ideas?
[10:57:59] <shoky> _cjm: .find looks for descendants
[10:58:11] <shoky> _cjm: maybe you want .filter
[10:58:34] <_cjm> shoky, Geeze!  Yes... I'm a moron...  So, how to I find one of a set I already have?
[10:58:51] <_cjm> shoky, Yes.  Thanks.
[11:00:50] <jexmex> using jquery mobile, I am trying to get it to only transition the content area with the content incoming from the ajax request
[11:01:04] <jexmex> cannot seem to find information on the docs on how to do this, does anybody have any experience with it?
[11:10:15] <Anchakor> hi, what is wrong with this use of detach() and appendTo()? http://pastebin.com/2p7Xh3CJ
[11:10:50] <shoky> Anchakor: after you detach it, it's no longer in the DOM, so querying again with $('#parses') will not find it
[11:11:13] <shoky> Anchakor: var parses = $('#parses').detach();  parses.empty();  ....
[11:11:57] <Anchakor> oooh I see
[11:12:22] <Anchakor> that was really dumb :)
[11:12:25] <Anchakor> thanks
[11:12:45] <shoky> it's good to not re-query the DOM anyway if you don't have to. even if it's still there ;p
[11:13:00] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I'm using .data() -- with no luck.  I have $x.data("player", {control: $a});  and I expect I should be able to reference the object as $x.data("player").control, but $s.data("player") is undefined.  What's wrong?
[11:13:25] <Anchakor> yeah, though some stuff like attribue manipulation you can't do the detach trick
[11:14:21] <shoky> `demo @ _cjm
[11:14:21] <b-ot> _cjm: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:15:21] <shoky> _cjm:  also you put data in $x, not in $s, so..
[11:16:15] <_cjm> shoky, Oops.  Fat fingered it.  This is my first use of .data() and it is fighting me.
[11:16:36] <_cjm> shoky, Have I not set/get this properly?
[11:16:44] <shoky> _cjm: i don't know, make a demo
[11:17:39] <shoky> $x.data("player") should not be undefined right after you do $x.data("player", {...})
[11:18:00] <_cjm> shoky, It's syntax.  set: $x.data("player", {control, $a});    get: $x.data("player").control    ?
[11:18:13] <shoky> syntax is fine.
[11:18:16] <shoky> er
[11:18:23] <shoky> except the control,
[11:18:33] <_cjm> shoky, Yeah... That's what I think...  So my syntax is correct, and that means I am doing something else wrong.
[11:18:41] <shoky> yuh
[11:18:48] <_cjm> shoky, "except the control"  ?
[11:19:08] <shoky> {control, $a}  in your last snippet.. nevermind
[11:19:18] <_cjm> Hey!  {control: $a}  Not {control, $x}
[11:19:37] <shoky> cool
[11:20:01] <_cjm> shoky, Fat fingered it again.  So, I need to hunt for my mistake.  Thanks for the help.
[11:23:16] <_cjm> shoky, I fumbled the traversal and the .data() was attached to a different node then the node I intended it to be.  Thanks for the help.
[11:23:38] <shoky> anytime~
[11:30:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky to the rescue
[11:32:50] <nafta> Rohan_Bhangui:
[11:32:53] <nafta> hold on
[11:33:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> aight
[11:33:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> google hangout prefered
[11:38:29] <kpl> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/26308090/ThemeRoller%20icon%20set  shows some checkbox and radiobutton icons. Are these currently available in themes made by themeroller, or if they can be manually added, how to use them?
[11:39:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: you there
[11:53:20] <gnuphilly> Hey Guys, I'm a total rookie in jQuery. I'm trying to do the following: When someone scrolls (up or down) automatically scroll to the previous or next block with a class. The problem is, when it automatically scrolls, it calls the function again, and it breaks the thing.
[11:53:28] <gnuphilly> anyone got a clue on how to do this?
[11:59:18] <gnuphilly> anyone?
[11:59:28] <BillCriswell> gnuphilly: http://benoit.pointet.info/stuff/jquery-scrollsnap-plugin/ might be helpful?
[12:01:07] <Forbidd3n> nyone here know why these are not working properly, please?
[12:01:08] <Forbidd3n> http://dev.perigeeenergy.com/frequently-asked-questions/
[12:02:29] <gnuphilly> hey BillCriswell, that's a good start, check this out, this is exactly what i want to do
[12:02:30] <gnuphilly> http://www.sanghan.co/#reel
[12:04:16] <BillCriswell> gnuphilly: Heavily influenced off of http://www.badassembly.com/ haha
[12:05:25] <gnuphilly> BillCriswell: that's really cool too, this is exactly the effect im looking for.
[12:06:35] <BillCriswell> gnuphilly: That site I think uses: http://www.idangero.us/sliders/swiper/
[12:06:54] <shoky> Forbidd3n: your accordion content is not in the same format as required by jquery-ui. http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[12:07:54] <Forbidd3n> shoky: I am using the bootstrap 3 example and it works here - http://jsfiddle.net/6NwQU/
[12:09:27] <shoky> Forbidd3n: you've included jquery-ui in your site, and .accordion() is calling the jquery-ui one
[12:09:40] <BillCriswell> gnuphilly: You from Philly?
[12:09:55] <gnuphilly> BillCriswell: Montreal
[12:10:03] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[12:10:30] <paulvd> how can i add a div after every li element
[12:10:32] <BillCriswell> Thought maybe a fellow Philadelphian was in here.
[12:10:34] <Forbidd3n> shoky: ok so unload jquery ui?
[12:10:48] <shoky> Forbidd3n: well.. if you're not using it, sure ;p
[12:10:55] <BillCriswell> paulvd: $('li').after('<div/>')
[12:11:09] <Forbidd3n> shoky: thanks, that worked
[12:11:17] <Forbidd3n> sorry for my ignorance.
[12:12:05] <shoky> you're fine, most people just go "it breaks the thing"
[12:12:35] <paulvd> BillCriswell: but will that add a div after every li element?
[12:12:48] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Yurp.
[12:12:52] <paulvd> ok thanks
[12:13:05] <BillCriswell> paulvd: http://jsbin.com/EFUfewo/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:13:16] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:14:29] <paulvd> yeah thanks again
[12:14:30] <BillCriswell> paulvd: It's invalid HTML.. but it gets you what you want.
[12:14:33] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:14:50] <paulvd> i was thinking if i have to use .each
[12:15:10] <hugo_moss> BillCriswell: to your earlier question, yes
[12:15:37] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: I have a terrible memory.
[12:16:05] <BillCriswell> and I'm also too lazy to look it up.
[12:16:10] <hugo_moss> <hugo_moss> i have an element that will be repeated n times on the page. i want to give each of these repeated elements a class of "classname-repeat#' like filtermenu-0, etc.  How can I attach an event handler for each of these filtermenu's separately.  I'm trying to avoid the same event handler being called for the repeating elements.  I can set an onclick handler, but I'm trying to separate
[12:16:10] <hugo_moss> javascript from content.
[12:16:38] <hugo_moss> ive done something so far
[12:16:49] <hugo_moss> and it seems to be working but i have another problem
[12:17:08] <hugo_moss> <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: Is the functionality for all these click event handles the same?
[12:17:28] <hugo_moss> what ive done is:
[12:18:02] <hugo_moss> ive grouped these elements by classes, each with a unique id
[12:18:16] <hugo_moss> so for like .filtermenu, it has .filtermenu-0 as the id
[12:18:24] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[12:18:42] <Zzaichik> Is there any way to track swipe events, more specifically swipe end, with jquery only?
[12:18:52] <hugo_moss> and what i do is, i turn on the event handlers using the parent class to enable all of them
[12:18:56] <hugo_moss> but then
[12:19:55] <hugo_moss> when i enable all of them, i do a foreach, and in the function handler, i pass the id of the current element being foreached to the function
[12:19:58] <hugo_moss> is that ok
[12:20:13] <hugo_moss> using this.id or something
[12:20:33] <raj> if I put a jquery object in an associative array with .data(), will it lose information about its parents and location in the DOM? Or can I still use it to point to the DOM element?
[12:21:07] <Zzaichik> Is there any way to track swipe events, more specifically swipe end, with jquery only? Meaning I don't want to use jquery.mobile if I don't have to.
[12:21:17] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You want to be able to click any of these items and pass the id of whatever element with clicked to a function?
[12:21:28] <hugo_moss> ya
[12:22:01] <hugo_moss> and it works
[12:22:06] <hugo_moss> but now i have another problem
[12:22:20] <jeebster> how can I grab the source of an html page and dump it into a string via jquery? do I perform a get request with a specific return type of html data?
[12:23:01] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You should be able to to do just like... $('.filters').on('click', '.filtermenu', function(){ someFunction(this.id); });
[12:23:31] <hippiestick> jeebster, yeap, i'd use a get
[12:23:43] <hippiestick> the response should be the html
[12:23:58] <astropirate> are there any more sites besides http://bootswatch.com   that have a gallery of bootstrap 3 themes?
[12:23:59] <jeebster> hippiestick: ok cool
[12:24:28] <hugo_moss> ok cool
[12:24:47] <hugo_moss> thanks
[12:24:57] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: No problem.
[12:31:38] <BillCriswell> Ugh. My checkboxes keep disappearing throughout Chrome.
[12:33:51] <raj> BillCriswell, why's that?
[12:34:06] <raj> misbehaving extension?
[12:35:18] <BillCriswell> raj: Damn, sadly not.
[12:35:50] <BillCriswell> The up and down arrows are also missing on my scrollbars, it's just gray buttons.
[12:35:58] <raj> check memory usage
[12:37:49] <BillCriswell> raj: I have no idea what happened but things are back.
[12:38:33] <shoky> raj: didn't understand your q
[12:38:43] <BillCriswell> Windows drives me nuts.
[12:39:10] <raj> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/YaaVe/
[12:39:13] <raj> something like that
[12:39:30] <raj> so I can save a pointer to a DOM object
[12:39:48] <shoky> sure, you can put whatever you want into .data
[12:39:55] <shoky> any javascript value
[12:40:22] <shoky> and access it like any javascript value
[12:40:50] <shoky> nobody will lose anything ;p
[12:40:54] <raj> :)
[12:40:56] <raj> ok, thank you
[12:42:10] <LoneSoldier728> hey how do i figure out what is selected from the drop down menu
[12:42:25] <astropirate> you pay someone to tell you
[12:42:31] <BillCriswell> $('#select-jawn').val()
[12:43:00] <LoneSoldier728> var z = $('.categories:selected').val();
[12:43:03] <LoneSoldier728> is this incorrect?
[12:43:14] <hippiestick> I have a tiny question which is probably caused by my not-so-complete understanding of regex. How come that testing "Z" with /Z/gi returns false?
[12:43:39] <raj> LoneSoldier728, if .categories represents each `option`
[12:43:46] <snover> js> /Z/gi.test("Z")
[12:43:50] <b-ot> snover: No output.
[12:43:52] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: You don't need the  :selected part if .categories is a select element.
[12:43:59] <LoneSoldier728> oh
[12:44:00] <snover> js> print /Z/gi.test("Z")
[12:44:05] <b-ot> snover: No output.
[12:44:09] <snover> b-ot: you suck
[12:44:12] <shoky> js> print(/Z/gi.test("Z"))
[12:44:15] <LoneSoldier728> that was it
[12:44:18] <b-ot> shoky: true
[12:44:20] <LoneSoldier728> didnt need :selected
[12:44:24] <snover> anyway the answer is true
[12:44:28] <shoky> hippiestick ^
[12:44:54] <hippiestick> shoky, weird, didn't work for me, so i changed it to just "i"
[12:45:13] <kpl> In themeroller, the corner radius setting affects most widgets, incl the spinner, but not the text input used in the Autocomplete example. How can that be styled?
[12:45:31] <hippiestick> anyway thanks
[13:06:12] <raj> `var test='abc'; $('p').each(function(i,el){var test='xyz'}); console.log(test)`  ... can I expect that to consistently be 'abc'?
[13:06:22] <raj> as in, it's safely scoped?
[13:06:50] <LoneSoldier728> var b = $(this).find('option:selected').attr("data-itemX");
[13:06:59] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying this to get the current option selected
[13:07:06] <LoneSoldier728> and then find the data attr
[13:07:14] <LoneSoldier728> but it is not working what am I doing wrong
[13:07:46] <raj> LoneSoldier728, why not use .data()?
[13:07:58] <raj> .data('itemX')
[13:08:16] <raj> LoneSoldier728, also, how is not working?
[13:08:24] <LoneSoldier728> var b = $(this).find('option:selected').data("itemX");
[13:08:29] <LoneSoldier728> tried this and it shows up as undefined
[13:08:43] <raj> .data() is undefined?
[13:08:49] <NoiseEee> does the option actually have a "data-itemx" attribute?
[13:09:50] <LoneSoldier728> i see
[13:10:15] <LoneSoldier728> the data-itemX="a string"
[13:10:28] <LoneSoldier728> but ya calling it and then console.log(b)
[13:10:31] <LoneSoldier728> shows up as undefined
[13:11:40] <LoneSoldier728> if i take away .data
[13:12:10] <LoneSoldier728> it shows the option selected
[13:12:23] <LoneSoldier728> i just cant get a hold of the data for some reason
[13:13:39] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: you'll have to jsfiddle something because http://jsfiddle.net/R3pjJ/
[13:14:00] <sahbeewah> raj: yes it's safely scoped...
[13:14:06] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: lowercase all your data- attributes
[13:14:15] <raj> thank you
[13:14:15] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[13:14:23] <raj> can I safely add a clickhandler prior to adding to the DOM?
[13:14:30] <raj> to a new element I'm creating
[13:14:56] <sahbeewah> raj: you can use event delegation to achieve the same effect (in most cases)
[13:15:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys got some issue swith my code
[13:15:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/3QL8U/
[13:15:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> its an ios7 otggle switch
[13:15:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> the plugin is in js section
[13:15:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> my code starts on line 1543
[13:15:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the js file
[13:15:50] <sahbeewah> $(existing_ancestor_element).on(event, to_be_created_selector, event_handler)
[13:15:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> now when you click, tap and hold button
[13:15:58] <LoneSoldier728> ah ok it does work but it only shows an opening bracket
[13:16:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> on toggle switch
[13:16:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> it reacts file
[13:16:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> the circle becomes elongated
[13:16:14] <LoneSoldier728> I am assuming because I json.stringify-ed the object before putting it in
[13:16:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> but when theswitch is active
[13:16:17] <gnuphilly> hey BillCriswell
[13:16:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> it doesnt do this
[13:16:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas
[13:16:29] <LoneSoldier728> am I suppose to parse it somehow or something so it shows me more than just a "{"
[13:16:34] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyy
[13:16:36] <gnuphilly> Just so you know, the problem was that I was using onScroll instead of the mouseWheel event
[13:16:42] <BillCriswell> http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/13/snapchat-spurned-3-billion-acquisition-offer-from-facebook/ This shit makes me sick to my stoamch.
[13:16:57] <BillCriswell> gnuphilly: Alll, make sense.
[13:18:22] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yes its disgusting
[13:19:48] <raj> sahbeewah, meaning?
[13:19:49] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I also feel like a complete idiot for not understanding how it can possibly be worth that much.
[13:19:52] <raj> so yes I can do that?
[13:20:03] <LoneSoldier728> even though I JSON.stringify and object and include it in the data-item attribute shouldn't i be getting more than just the first "{" which is the first string
[13:20:10] <gvo> So now sexting will come back strong?
[13:20:33] <LoneSoldier728> shouldn't i be getting the ones separated by the commas too?
[13:21:02] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: it can't possibly be, its so ridiculous, they have zero income, a super-shitty app UI (and app), and its all based on number of users.
[13:21:35] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: jsfiddle or out
[13:22:01] <LoneSoldier728> kk js fiddling it
[13:22:07] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: are you actually trying to put a JSON string as an data-attribute of an element?  why not just store a reference?
[13:23:57] <BillCriswell> My damn brain hurts.
[13:25:24] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/Gt4Tz/
[13:25:28] <LoneSoldier728> ok there sorry about that
[13:25:47] <LoneSoldier728> NoiseEee what do you mean by reference?
[13:26:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi guys is ther anyway
[13:26:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> using hammer js
[13:26:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> to like run an animation part ways
[13:26:43] <sahbeewah> raj: i showed you an example of how to achieve that effect on an element to be created
[13:26:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> what im thinking is
[13:26:56] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: clearly you can see the problematic quotes in your <option> ????
[13:26:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> when some one drags a toggle switch in iOs
[13:27:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> iOS they can start the anmation part ways
[13:27:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and stop it partw ays
[13:27:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> *partways
[13:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anyway to achieve this using keyframe animation
[13:27:59] <LoneSoldier728> yeah the only thing is that is how JSON.stringify includes the data which is an object with a bunch of key value paires
[13:28:02] <LoneSoldier728> pairs
[13:28:46] <LoneSoldier728> if I don't stringify it I am not sure how to include it in the data attr
[13:30:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: might i pick your brain
[13:30:53] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: something along the lines of data-itemx="{" name":"taco="" bell","brand":"s","weather":"hot","date_added":"2013-11-13t17:04:35.765z", "color":["s"]}"=""
[13:31:22] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: i don't know why you're stringifying anything, etc, but if you need data, use a lookup/dictionary and get it from THERE
[13:32:11] <LoneSoldier728> What the data is doing is basically saying, if you select this item - then I want to be able to take that data stored in the option and show a preview
[13:32:15] <LoneSoldier728> does that make sense?
[13:33:56] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: i get it, but store the data in an object that has the value of the item as its lookup/key/index
[13:34:04] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: anyways, thats what id suggest.
[13:34:08] <LoneSoldier728> another option i see fit but is a lot of work for it... is basically storing all the data in the localstorage and just storing an object id
[13:34:29] <Roger_> hi all!
[13:34:30] <LoneSoldier728> ok, then query the db with the index?
[13:34:52] <LoneSoldier728> i wanted to avoid sending another query
[13:35:17] <Roger_> can someone maybe help me to get a selector right?
[13:35:31] <NoiseEee> if you already have it available to your HTML element LoneSoldier728, than surely you can just write the lookup object at page load / same time?
[13:36:10] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: its common practice to have a JS Object ready to be queried for data/etc rather than make an XHR request to get the data, if the data is available at pageload/beforehand
[13:38:06] <LoneSoldier728> ah ok
[13:38:12] <LoneSoldier728> so I just set it to a variable or something
[13:38:21] <LoneSoldier728> and it will just be on the page
[13:38:40] <NoiseEee> yeah.
[13:38:51] <NoiseEee> just put it in a <script> somewhere
[13:38:58] <LoneSoldier728> for some reason I was just under the impression that it would be deleted
[13:39:15] <NoiseEee> not unless you overwrite it :)
[13:39:26] <LoneSoldier728> hehe kk thanks!
[13:40:17] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: sorry, I realized my pastebin link was never pasted
[13:41:15] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: http://jsfiddle.net/Gt4Tz/2/
[13:46:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: might i pick your brain for something
[13:46:48] <NoiseEee> Rohan_Bhangui: sure, but i don't know a thing about ui or mobile
[13:46:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anyway to execute an animation that is controlled by the amount of drag of a clicked mouse
[13:47:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh so you did read it
[13:47:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> see the thing is i was asking too specific of an applciation once
[13:47:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> i get it doen for desktop
[13:47:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can port it over
[13:47:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what you think
[13:48:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anyway to detect drag amount
[13:48:36] <NoiseEee> i just don't know Rohan_Bhangui, probably by observing dragStart / mouseMove etc?
[13:48:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[13:49:14] <NoiseEee> on drag start, set X,  on mouseMove, increment X by pixels moved... on dragStop, present X
[13:51:57] <raj> sahbeewah, what's wrong with `.on()`?
[13:52:02] <raj> instead of .delegate?
[13:54:55] <shoky> raj: nothing
[13:56:28] <raj> thank you good sir
[13:57:07] <BillCriswell> shoky finally said something useful.
[13:57:29] <shoky> i ated too much pie.
[13:57:38] <BillCriswell> awww
[13:57:45] <raj> high class problems
[13:58:30] <shoky> can't hear you from up here
[13:59:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[14:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: i was thinking more along the lines of stopping animation in various points of a keyframe animation
[14:04:14] <ashley_matmonste> My nivo slider has very slow load times… usually about 60 seconds to load the first slide. Can anyone help me?
[14:06:12] <BillCriswell> ashley_matmonste: Did you resize the images?
[14:06:29] <BillCriswell> Or, are you on a 56K?
[14:06:56] <ashley_matmonste> yea the slides are all sized correctly
[14:07:23] <BillCriswell> Are they PNGs when they should be JPG?
[14:08:25] <ashley_matmonste> they are png files…
[14:08:26] <BillCriswell> ashley_matmonste: Is it live anywhere for people to see?
[14:08:50] <BillCriswell> It could be a bunch of stuff, seeing it in action would help clear it up pretty quickly probably.
[14:09:15] <ashley_matmonste> i turned off the slider until i fixed the issue… i will turn it back on right now and the web address is matmonster.com
[14:11:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: you nanything about pausing and playing css3 animations part ways
[14:13:29] <ashley_matmonste> ok the slides have been enabled again… matmonster.com is the url
[14:14:43] <ashley_matmonste> do the slides need to be jpg??
[14:15:31] <BillCriswell> ashley_matmonste: There's no reason that one shouldn't be. It's close to 1MB large.
[14:16:33] <BillCriswell> ashley_matmonste: A few files are missing as well, cycle.js, mocha.js, jquery.noconflict.js, commonstyles.css and the site seal from nexess is really holding your page up.
[14:17:24] <ashley_matmonste> ok…. i just started managing this site … it was like this when i received the files…
[14:17:37] <ashley_matmonste> what do you recommend i do?
[14:19:17] <BillCriswell> I'd find out if you need those files I mentioned, if you do make sure they're where they belong, if not don't try to include them. Then I'd remove the reference to the "SSL Seal" as well, that's really screwing things up.
[14:19:58] <BillCriswell> and then I'd try to optimize those slide show images. If you go JPG and save it at like 50% quality it should help a whole lot.
[14:20:25] <ashley_matmonste> ok, I will see what i can do … thank you
[14:20:31] <BillCriswell> If you're in Chrome open the developer tools and click the "Network" tab and look out for red shit.
[14:20:39] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[14:21:01] <BillCriswell> I'm out
[14:21:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: hey
[14:21:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> might i pick your brain
[14:21:58] <Velveeta> sure
[14:22:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> css3 animations
[14:22:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> any way to stop them
[14:22:12] <Velveeta> not to my knowledge
[14:22:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> well pause them on drag
[14:22:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> tell you what im trying t do
[14:22:25] <Velveeta> they're not programmatic in nature
[14:22:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://ui-animations.tumblr.com/post/52966686778/ios-7s-toggle-switch-recorded-on-screen-for
[14:22:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> i want to make that
[14:22:34] <Velveeta> so i'm pretty sure there's no way to interrupt them programmatically
[14:22:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> now there are tons of code pens
[14:22:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> but not exactly that
[14:22:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> think its possible
[14:23:29] <Velveeta> i don't think that's a paused animation
[14:23:33] <Velveeta> i think it's 2 separately transitions
[14:23:41] <Velveeta> one for :active, and one for an added class toggle
[14:23:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> this is what i got so far
[14:23:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/pad6w/
[14:24:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> resoan i asked about pause
[14:24:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> is becasue you can also tap and hold and drag
[14:24:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and animation can be reverse
[14:25:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: any ideas on how i can replicate first link animation using css3 and a bit of js magic
[14:25:47] <Velveeta> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pad6w/1/
[14:26:29] <Velveeta> i didn't add any styles yet, just the class addition/removal
[14:27:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> what does the class do?
[14:28:36] <Velveeta> it doesn't do anything right now, it's up to you to implement whatever styles you want that to apply whenever they mousedown and hold
[14:29:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[14:29:43] <Velveeta> and inside that listener, you can probably add an additional listener for mouseup and mouseleave, to have it remove that class, and you could then strip the removeClass from the click handler
[14:30:17] <Velveeta> so on mousedown, it would add an active class, and a listener for mouseover/mouseleave, each of which would remove the active class.. the active class itself would apply the widened styling or whatever
[14:30:38] <Velveeta> and with that, i need to gtfo, i'm actually gonna leave the office early today……….. so i can have more time at home to work.........
[14:31:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay cya in a bit
[14:31:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause the enxt question i have is a big one
[14:31:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/pad6w/2/
[14:31:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> toggle it to on
[14:31:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> toggle it to active
[14:31:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> now toggle it back to off
[14:31:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> when you mousedown
[14:31:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> it doesnt expand width
[14:35:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone else able to assist
[14:35:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> -webkit-transition-duration: .2s;
[14:35:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/pad6w/3/
[14:35:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> any assist shoky?
[15:36:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: back yet?
[15:39:27] <cfedde> should I expect three deep selectors to work? $( '#results_table tbody tr' ).hover( set_bkgrnd, unset_bkgrnd );
[15:39:46] <snover> cfedde: for goodness sake, use css
[15:40:02] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: yep
[15:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[15:40:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[15:40:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> your solution kinda helped
[15:40:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/pad6w/7/
[15:40:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> see wht happens
[15:40:31] <Velveeta> cfedde: what snover said
[15:40:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> when you toggle BACK to the off state
[15:40:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> the think should expand width but it doesnt
[15:41:51] <cfedde> Velveeta: snover indeed CSS does work. but can I use css to call call code?
[15:42:23] <Velveeta> you can use css selectors, yes, but if your specific use case is to set hover background states, that's much better handled through css
[15:42:35] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i'm looking at it now
[15:42:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[15:46:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: im trying to establish some new code as well
[15:47:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was able to get that thing i was talking about
[15:47:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> to work
[15:47:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> but withut animation
[15:47:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> since i wrote it from scratch
[15:49:04] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: it looks like your -webkit-animation-name: switchThumbAnimation; property on your .on class
[15:49:12] <Velveeta> when i disable that property, the width stretches to what it should be
[15:49:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[15:49:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold sending you some new code that needs animation it works well
[15:50:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: check it http://jsfiddle.net/U9W83/
[15:50:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to apply animation to that
[15:50:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry for the goose chase
[15:50:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/U9W83/1/
[15:53:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: still there?
[15:55:11] <Velveeta> yeah, had to answer the door
[15:58:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[15:58:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> i almost got it
[15:58:24] <grafi> i dont
[15:58:25] <grafi> :P
[16:00:07] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/U9W83/9/
[16:00:32] <Velveeta> you shouldn't need all that -webkit-animation stuff, just a simple -webkit-transition on -webkit-transform
[16:01:02] <grafi> looks shitty in firefox xD
[16:01:46] <Velveeta> well there are no moz rules in there yet :D
[16:02:19] <grafi> and what about ie11 ?
[16:02:19] <grafi> xD
[16:02:28] <grafi> im about to get the update oô
[16:03:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill come back in a bit
[16:03:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> but grafi
[16:03:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> this is bound fro mobile
[16:03:38] <grafi> you know firefox has a mobile browser?
[16:03:39] <grafi> xD
[16:06:25] <tab1293> Can I create a form dynamically with jquery, not attach it to the dom, still submit it to download a file that is being read by php's readfile()?
[16:07:21] <grafi> oô
[16:07:27] <grafi> tab1293 what?
[16:07:27] <grafi> ^^
[16:07:44] <Velveeta> download or upload?
[16:07:57] <grafi> duwpload
[16:08:05] <tab1293> grafi: okay so I am trying to download a file from the server that is being read by php's readfile() function
[16:08:06] <Velveeta> if you're trying to force a download, you don't need a form, you need to push out an octet-stream from php
[16:08:08] <grafi> duwp duwp
[16:08:17] <sasmit87> Hi all
[16:08:26] <Velveeta> forms are for uploading to the server, not downloading from
[16:08:38] <grafi> still confused
[16:08:38] <grafi> :P
[16:08:41] <grafi> hi sasmit87
[16:09:05] <tab1293> Velveeta: forms are for downloading files as well
[16:09:18] <benth> i'm using Draggable and changing the draggable's parent while moving it around, and this is messing with the draggable's position--it's not sticking with where the mouse is
[16:09:21] <benth> how can i fix this?
[16:09:21] <grafi> in what world
[16:09:21] <grafi> oô
[16:09:31] <Velveeta> forms are strictly for *up*loading data to the server
[16:09:41] <tab1293> I just can't use a form because it will screw with the design of my site so I am trying to dynamically create a form and just submit it
[16:09:43] <Velveeta> if the server takes that data and pushes out a download, that's separate from the form submission
[16:09:58] <tab1293> Velveeta: so then how would you normally request a download from a server?
[16:10:27] <sasmit87> Hi
[16:10:28] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/7QNNWMhScQN3VAdZypH9h4
[16:10:35] <Velveeta> well normally you would click on some element, but if you were, say, typing in the name of a file you wanted to download, the server would receive that form submission and in turn, generate a download by pushing out an octet-stream
[16:10:48] <Velveeta> the form itself doesn't create the download, it just tells the server you want to start one
[16:11:48] <grafi> so probably just ajax and boing
[16:11:50] <grafi> ôo
[16:12:42] <sasmit87> so there are are 3 similar blocks but that code is only applying to 3rd block why??
[16:12:54] <sasmit87> I mean for i=3 only
[16:13:58] <grafi> omg :o
[16:14:33] <sasmit87> what?
[16:15:59] <grafi> erm
[16:16:03] <grafi> what about the html
[16:16:15] <tab1293> Velveeta: so given a link that will read the file how would I use jquery make a request to that link?
[16:17:01] <grafi> $.ajax({ type: 'post', url: 'url'})
[16:17:02] <grafi> :P
[16:17:34] <raj> can I pass arguments to a named function for an eventhandler?
[16:18:23] <grafi> such as?
[16:18:28] <sasmit87> any help??
[16:19:00] <raj> $('p').on('click', doSomething({'use':'this'}))
[16:19:50] <raj> nm
[16:19:57] <grafi> what would you pass to it
[16:19:58] <grafi> oô
[16:20:09] <grafi> sasmit87 what about the html?
[16:20:14] <raj> phat blunt
[16:20:15] <grafi> paste/fiddle
[16:21:01] <grafi> sure
[16:23:16] <sasmit87> grafi:  http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/careerDetails
[16:23:34] <sasmit87> check the My project  works Section
[16:27:59] <grafi> sasmit87 and the 3 button works like expected?
[16:30:40] <sasmit87> 	http://paste.ofcode.org/7QNNWMhScQN3VAdZypH9h4
[16:31:06] <sasmit87> here if you alert i inside for loop its giving the last value only
[16:31:22] <sasmit87> I mean 3
[16:31:55] <sasmit87> instead inside for loop it should alert 3 times as 1,2,3
[16:35:44] <shoky> raj: you can pass event data:  $('p').on('click', doSomething, {'use':'this'});  function doSomething(event) { console.log(event.data) }
[16:36:15] <shoky> raj: you can make an anonymous function  $('p').on('click', function() { doSomething({'use':'this'}) })
[16:36:39] <shoky> raj: you can use .bind  $('p').on('click', doSomething.bind(null, {'use':'this'}))
[16:36:50] <grafi> by the time you click it "i" is at 3 or something like that, i bet shoky knows how to explain that exactly :P you should look into event delegation and add some sensible classes to your markup, would make the code a lot cleaner and you wouldnt have to do so much crazy stuff to make the eventbindings work sasmit87
[16:37:26] <shoky> raj: ok just saw your nm ;\
[16:37:40] <grafi> a+ for effort though shoky
[16:37:41] <grafi> :)
[16:37:48] <shoky> ;p
[16:40:23] <Velveeta> sasmit87: given a link that will read the file, you don't need to use jquery to make a request to that link.. you can set window.location to the url if the url will kickstart the download automatically
[16:40:47] <grafi> i bet you mis-tabbed there
[16:41:48] <Velveeta> sasmit87: as for your question about the loop, grafi had the gist of it… those click functions maintain a reference to i through their closure scope, and when they're clicked, that loop has long since been completed, and i == 3 at that point, so that's what gets alerted
[16:41:51] <shoky> sasmit87: by the time the click handler is called, the loop is already long finished
[16:42:18] <grafi> the smart man always knows who knows the answer *cough*
[16:42:32] <shoky> *belch*
[16:42:52] <grafi> you alright there buddy?
[16:42:53] <grafi> :P
[16:42:55] * Velveeta hands shoky another beer.
[16:43:11] * shoky downs
[16:43:15] <grafi> oô
[16:43:17] <Velveeta> they say the human brain needs blood to survive, but this is a common misconception.. you just gotta keep it wet
[16:43:22] <shoky> better than alright, i'm ok.
[16:43:28] <grafi> Velveeta ha
[16:43:34] <Velveeta> lol, i like that, i might have to use it
[16:44:57] <shoky> sasmit87: here's one way to fix it  http://paste.ofcode.org/7dv5ugeszRpfJifvjwEHB2
[16:45:06] <grafi> is ok really better than alight
[16:45:10] <grafi> seems arbitrary
[16:45:11] <grafi> :P
[16:45:15] <shoky> lol
[16:45:29] <grafi> shoky you are the devil oô
[16:45:38] <grafi> this man doesnt need closures
[16:45:59] <Velveeta> sasmit87: shoky's example is about as elegant as they come
[16:46:06] <grafi> oO
[16:46:09] <grafi> yonk
[16:46:10] <grafi> :P
[16:46:38] <shoky> sasmit87: here's another  http://paste.ofcode.org/vxdyuCndqKmTWeqnFJ5jwZ
[16:46:40] <Velveeta> if i click the edit button on that to show another example, is it gonna create a new instance or overwrite the existing one
[16:46:52] <sasmit87> okay
[16:46:55] <shoky> seems to create new ones
[16:47:01] <Velveeta> ok cool
[16:47:35] <grafi> oh for fucks sake microsoft, just leave me alone ._.
[16:47:37] <shoky> sasmit87: but the ideal solution is to not have numbered ids like that, but just use a shared class for those elements
[16:47:49] <grafi> brb gotta restart before my os throws a fit ..
[16:48:14] <shoky> sasmit87: and maybe a data-id="1" attribute if you need those ids
[16:48:31] <shoky> then you don't need a loop
[16:48:40] <shoky> at least not an explicit one
[16:48:41] <sasmit87> but if I use classes
[16:48:49] <sasmit87> how do I know which one I clicked
[16:48:58] <shoky> using "this"
[16:49:05] <Velveeta> here's another example: http://paste.ofcode.org/37fsArYFevkLDN2PpFHCsnj
[16:49:12] <sasmit87> that I know
[16:49:12] <shoky> var el = $(this); el.addClass('lol'); ...
[16:49:21] <Velveeta> although, now that usage of 'this' is being advocated, that kinda nullifies my example :D
[16:49:39] <Velveeta> damnit shoky, you deprecated my code before it was even out the door
[16:50:04] <shoky> sry dude. here's half of your beer back
[16:50:16] <Velveeta> :D
[16:51:10] <shoky> sasmit87: or el.closest('.work_project_parent').removeClass('huhu')  or el.find('.bgSeparator').whatever()    just examples, i dont really know what your DOM looks like
[16:51:19] <shoky> (and you'd need to use those classes instead of ids)
[16:52:37] <sasmit87> see on click of that element I need to do some dom manipulation
[16:52:45] <sasmit87> for about 4 to 5 elements
[16:53:17] <sasmit87> and all blocks are same having same elemnts just like clone
[16:53:33] <sasmit87> so how do I handle that 4 or 5 3l3mnts
[16:53:40] <sasmit87> if you look my code
[16:54:05] <grafi> this is me
[16:54:07] <grafi> back again
[16:54:09] <grafi> *sings*
[16:56:26] <grafi> oh windows you so funny
[16:56:35] <grafi> "important updates could not be installed"
[16:56:48] <grafi> but it installed all available updates, except bing desktop
[16:56:51] <grafi> whatever that is
[16:57:19] <sasmit87> shoky : anyway you code is working and it helped me a lot
[16:57:23] <sasmit87> thanks :)
[16:57:34] <sasmit87> *your code
[16:57:49] <shoky> sasmit87: i highly encourage you to drop those ids and use classes. learn how to get from "this" to the related elements you want to manipulate
[16:58:30] <sasmit87> okay
[16:59:03] <sasmit87> that will cause performance issue??
[16:59:23] <shoky> no, it will cause your code to be totally gross
[16:59:32] <shoky> your code and html
[17:00:01] <shoky> and it will make it much harder for you each time you want to change/add some functionality
[17:01:05] <sasmit87> okay

[17:26:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually there is a saying
[17:26:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> grwoing old is mandatory
[17:26:50] <Velveeta> realizing how much you didn't know shit in your 20's
[17:26:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> growing up is optional
[17:26:58] <grafi> Velveeta :D
[17:27:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol im in that stage right now so shuuush
[17:27:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> LOL
[17:27:09] <raj> I'm not wrapping my head around `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)`
[17:27:09] <Velveeta> as much as i thought i knew :D
[17:27:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> rafi im 18
[17:27:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> *grafi
[17:27:22] <Velveeta> raj: what about it?
[17:27:25] <grafi> cool story bro
[17:27:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[17:27:35] <grafi> i barely remember when i was 18
[17:27:36] <grafi> ...
[17:27:40] <grafi> must have been drunk
[17:27:40] <grafi> :P
[17:27:43] <raj> Velveeta, wtf is going on?
[17:27:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahahaha
[17:27:48] <Velveeta> i remember being broke and mostly unemployed when i was 18
[17:27:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got 1 more year before i candrink
[17:27:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> *can drink
[17:28:01] <raj> how can I break that into multiple lines, firstly
[17:28:05] <raj> Velveeta, ^^
[17:28:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i am unemployed though i do contract work
[17:28:34] <Velveeta> well, you can't break that into multiple lines, that's a single statement
[17:28:52] <Velveeta> but to explain it, arguments is a special object, not an actual array, although it can be iterated over like an array
[17:28:53] <raj> Velveeta, what is with .slice.call(...)
[17:28:54] <raj> ?
[17:28:58] <raj> .slice is for an array
[17:29:05] <raj> and then I'm calling something?
[17:29:16] <Velveeta> but if you want to use array functions like slice on it, you have to call it from the array prototype and invoke it in the scope of the arguments object
[17:29:48] <raj> english?
[17:29:49] <Velveeta> you're calling the array slice method, and telling it that when it executes, it should execute in the scope of the arguments object, so that 'this' keyword is arguments
[17:30:26] <Velveeta> so internally, the array slice method expects to iterate over itself and slice off some indexes
[17:30:38] <Velveeta> it has access to things like this.length
[17:30:40] <raj> Velveeta, .slice() is supposed to take arguments
[17:30:51] <raj> how is getting arguments?
[17:30:54] <Velveeta> right, the number 1 is being passed as its argument
[17:31:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i got one problem i gotta sort out
[17:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/C3wRB/3/
[17:31:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> run in chrome please
[17:31:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> or safari
[17:31:20] <Velveeta> the Function.call method, which is what that's using, takes its first parameter as the scope to execute that function in, any parameters after that are the ones received by the function, in order
[17:31:22] <grafi> dont have
[17:31:23] <grafi> :P
[17:31:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> go get it
[17:31:35] <Velveeta> raj: here you go, for reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[17:31:38] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui does it work in ie11 ?
[17:31:39] <grafi> :P
[17:31:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> get chrome
[17:31:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[17:31:50] <grafi> ie5?
[17:31:56] <grafi> i have netscape
[17:32:00] <grafi> would that work
[17:32:07] <Velveeta> raj: as another example, to help understand, let's say you were doing $(element).css('padding', '10px')
[17:32:13] <raj> ok
[17:32:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: are you trying every non webkit browser
[17:32:29] <Velveeta> you could also call that like this: $.fn.css.call(element, 'padding', '10px')
[17:32:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> what ar eyou anti webkit
[17:32:40] <grafi> i would never try opera 11.56.12.2.1
[17:32:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> try oepra 12
[17:32:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> its built using webkit
[17:32:57] <Velveeta> so you're executing the $.fn.css function, telling it to use 'element' as its scope for the 'this' keyword, and passing 'padding' and '10px' for its parameters
[17:32:58] <grafi> naw dud
[17:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[17:33:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> well try chrome them
[17:33:09] <grafi> dont have it
[17:33:10] <raj> ok
[17:33:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> *then like all normal people :P
[17:33:12] <grafi> :P
[17:33:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> get it
[17:33:55] <Velveeta> raj: function.call has a sibling method called function.apply which is nearly identical, but the parameters are passed as an array instead of comma-separated
[17:34:10] <Velveeta> so you could also do this: $.fn.css.apply(element, ['padding', '10px']);
[17:34:37] <raj> Velveeta, I'm basicaly looking at http://paste.ofcode.org/T3eYr3BCyDXk3GvYVPAdys
[17:35:44] <Velveeta> raj: so what that code is doing is saying if methods[method] exists, call it with function.apply, but pass 'this' as the scope, and for the arguments to the function, pass everything from the arguments that were passed into this function, minus the first parameter
[17:35:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: why do you hate on chrome and safari so much
[17:35:59] <Velveeta> so if that function was called like this: foo(a, b, c, d)
[17:36:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> the age of firefox came and went
[17:36:11] <grafi> did it now
[17:36:11] <Velveeta> then it would call methods[method] and pass b, c, d onto it
[17:36:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[17:36:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> so here is the issue
[17:36:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> when you click and hold when the toggle is in offstate
[17:36:32] <grafi> still dont have chrome
[17:36:33] <grafi> btw
[17:36:34] <grafi> xD
[17:36:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> it is still white i need the background to be grey
[17:36:39] <grafi> 02:36:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> the age of firefox came and went
[17:36:39] <grafi> [02:36:11] <grafi> did it now
[17:36:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[17:36:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> it did
[17:37:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> firefox showed what was possible and the mistkae that microsoft made by thinking browser wars were over
[17:37:14] <Velveeta> raj: otherwise, if method itself is an object, it tries to invoke that object's "init" method and pass itself as the scope, and the full list of arguments to that function: a, b, c, and d
[17:37:14] <shoky> raj: .call is very similar to .apply
[17:37:36] <grafi> i like my firefox better than chrome
[17:37:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> chrome came in along with safaris help to devlop what i think of as one of the greatest web revolutions
[17:37:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> webkit
[17:37:52] <Velveeta> grafi: i used to like firefox better than chrome also, because i was just so well-versed in firebug
[17:37:52] <shoky> raj:  .call(context, a, b, c)  is same as .apply(context, [a,b,c])
[17:37:59] <grafi> na
[17:38:04] <grafi> devtools rock
[17:38:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually ie11 dev tools
[17:38:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> are really coming along
[17:38:18] <grafi> oh
[17:38:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> still clunky though
[17:38:23] <grafi> i didnt even look at those
[17:38:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[17:38:26] <Velveeta> ie11 dev tools had me really surprised when i saw them at jquery conference here
[17:38:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> wow they were at jquery nice
[17:38:46] <Velveeta> well *they* weren't
[17:38:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol chrome actually got updates a few days a ago Velveeta
[17:38:55] <sasmit87> Hey how can I trigger a particular event handler
[17:38:57] <Velveeta> but the presenter before me did a presenttaion on debugging utilities
[17:38:57] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/cgX4bCZSXtRLDKyyaPNw6w
[17:38:59] <shoky> they had me surprised when they made ie totalfailcrash and dissuaded me from giving it a try
[17:39:06] <Velveeta> and as part of that, he demo'd some of those latest IE utils
[17:39:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[17:39:13] <grafi> oh yeah, massive jump forward
[17:39:22] <sasmit87> here that function is executing onclick of a cancel button
[17:39:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> still fighting a losing battle im afraid
[17:39:27] <Velveeta> `api trigger @ sasmit87
[17:39:27] <b-ot> sasmit87: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:39:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you see chrome 32 beta updates?
[17:39:53] <sasmit87> but I want same to execucte on a setTImeout
[17:40:06] <grafi> ha nice
[17:40:11] <grafi> my internet explorer just crashed
[17:40:12] <grafi> xD
[17:40:14] <grafi> so great
[17:40:21] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: nope, i'm too buried in work to keep up to date on betas, i tried to read tech articles as regularly as i can, but even that doesn't keep me up to date
[17:40:25] <shoky> that's what i said
[17:40:40] <shoky> IE11=fail
[17:40:43] <Velveeta> fortunately, at our company, we have a pretty outspoken front end organization that constantly shares emerging technologies
[17:41:12] <grafi> shoky i think its good that they fucking try
[17:41:13] <grafi> ...
[17:41:19] <shoky> really?
[17:41:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: so you probably noticed chrome has begun to get rid of native menus and ui stuff and put their own (at least for windows) ...they just removed native scrollbars and put the one that they use in gmail and they moved the emulation tools
[17:41:32] <grafi> well i'd rather they stop
[17:41:34] <Velveeta> as long as they can render web documents properly, that's all i care about, outside of that, it can crash all fucking day
[17:41:39] <shoky> :P
[17:41:41] <grafi> but trying hard is better than not trying :P
[17:41:45] <Velveeta> as long as i don't have to spend an extra 30 hours per release debugging styles for it :D
[17:41:45] <grafi> auto updates yay
[17:41:55] <grafi> so we dont get stuck on ie6 all over again
[17:41:55] <grafi> <.<
[17:42:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: one issue is that they have not fixed antialiasing for webpages
[17:42:12] <shoky> no way in hell am i letting MS auto update anything for me
[17:42:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[17:42:25] <grafi> sure, but thats irrelevant
[17:42:27] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: well "removed native scrollbars" probably isn't exactly accurate, they probably just support styling of scrollbars and have predefined styles for their own
[17:42:31] <shoky> indeed
[17:42:32] <sasmit87> hey how can I use trigger inside setTimeout lets say after 3000 miliseconds
[17:42:32] <grafi> because you probably use netscape anyways
[17:42:40] <grafi> :P
[17:42:43] <shoky> mosaic
[17:42:51] <grafi> the power
[17:42:52] <grafi> :P
[17:42:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: why would you need trigger just run the code insdie the setTImeout
[17:42:58] <Velveeta> i only use an original alpha version of lynx
[17:43:06] <Velveeta> because i don't want to risk someone breaking something with an update
[17:43:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[17:43:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> how did this turn to a legacy browser session
[17:43:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> discussion

[17:50:14] <sasmit87> how?
[17:50:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> you said your code in a click event is the same code that i was asking you to paste in the setTimeout right?

[17:58:28] <grafi> how can anyone not have folder with gifs/funny images at their disposal
[17:58:35] <Velveeta> exactly!
[17:58:42] <grafi> i accidentally a word
[17:58:44] <grafi> oô
[17:58:49] <Velveeta> oh man, i saw a great one the other night, let me dig it up
[17:59:24] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/jyiifTF.gif
[17:59:26] <shoky> fine i'll chime in ... https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1390500_706761056002057_611277332_n.jpg
[17:59:40] <grafi> shoky at his finest
[17:59:56] <Velveeta> here we go
[18:00:04] <raj> shoky, but what is .slice() doing in there?
[18:00:15] <raj> oh, i'm ignoring the actual method, i suppose?
[18:00:19] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/Foto%2008.10.13%2023%2037%2004.gif
[18:00:26] <shoky> raj: they want to skip the first argument (the method name)
[18:00:31] <Velveeta> so, i'm in this fantasy football league at work, and on sundays, we often find ourselves on skype at the end of the night while our teams mostly finish up
[18:00:43] <Velveeta> and one guy had *just* made up the points he needed to beat his matchup for this week
[18:01:04] <Velveeta> and when i pointed it out "there's your points!" this was his response: http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2887/10785269926_0a6ecb5607_o.gif
[18:01:05] <shoky> raj:  arr.slice(1)  will get you arr without the first item
[18:01:25] <shoky> raj: and so will Array.prototype.slice.call(arr, 1)
[18:01:30] <raj> the chaining of .slice.call() is confusing
[18:01:36] <shoky> raj: but only the 2nd one works with "arguments"
[18:01:40] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/2nfvNL7.gif
[18:01:44] <raj> I expect .slice(stuff).call(otherstuff)
[18:02:18] <Velveeta> and then at the end of the night, when he won by 1 friggin point and i told him that was close, this was his response: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdmu2M7qFo
[18:02:27] <raj> or even .slice(stuff.call(otherstuff)
[18:02:38] <shoky> slice.call(...)   calling the slice function
[18:02:53] <raj> ohh1
[18:02:56] <raj> !

[18:33:41] <seanz> Greetings esteemed humans. I am looking to find certain <div> elements, in order, that have one of two different class names.
[18:33:49] <seanz> Anyone have experience doing this?
[18:38:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i nailed the entire toggle its perfect
[18:38:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> except for firefox :P
[18:38:24] <grafi> so not perfect then
[18:38:24] <grafi> :p
[18:38:37] <Velveeta> nobody uses firefox really, except a lot of people
[18:39:01] <grafi> anyone know the market share on mobile
[18:39:02] <grafi> oô
[18:39:08] <grafi> i bet its nothing
[18:39:17] <Velveeta> yeah mobile firefox i bet is pretty low
[18:39:23] <Velveeta> it's gonna be almost entire webkit and ie
[18:39:40] <grafi> yeah
[18:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[18:39:47] <grafi> its ok though
[18:39:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[18:39:48] <grafi> :P
[18:39:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> for those chrome users
[18:39:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry grafi
[18:39:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/C3wRB/4/
[18:39:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: check it
[18:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> its exact now
[18:40:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> down to the transitions
[18:40:30] <grafi> that really is perfect
[18:40:36] <grafi> :)
[18:40:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> the real one in case you wanna compare
[18:40:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://ui-animations.tumblr.com/post/52966686778/ios-7s-toggle-switch-recorded-on-screen-for
[18:40:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how you check it out
[18:40:47] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: you still need to add mouseleave and mousemove listeners to it though, if you click and hold, then drag off the element, it leaves the active class
[18:40:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh yes
[18:41:07] <Velveeta> but yeah it's looking good
[18:41:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> well in touch how would i take care of that
[18:41:22] <grafi> i opened chrome
[18:41:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> or would that not matter
[18:41:25] <grafi> a looked at it
[18:41:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[18:41:28] <grafi> *and+
[18:41:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> :)
[18:41:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: how would i do that with a touch library
[18:41:53] <grafi> i find it funny that you can honestly think i would not have chrome installed ^^
[18:42:03] <grafi> i develop for that piece of shot
[18:42:07] <grafi> shit even
[18:42:08] <grafi> :P
[18:42:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> if cause in touch if it meets a threshold for swipe it changes
[18:42:16] <Velveeta> you'd have to use touchmove for one thing, and i'm not sure what the equivalent of mouseleave is, there's probably a touchleave
[18:42:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb
[18:42:45] <grafi> stahp
[18:42:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> see what you can do
[18:42:52] <grafi> is what the event is called
[18:42:52] <Velveeta> since when is chrome a piece of shit?
[18:42:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill be back in about 1 hour
[18:43:08] <Velveeta> not touchstop
[18:43:17] <Velveeta> i'm talking about swiping off of the element
[18:43:21] <grafi> i'd argue that is no less of a piece of shit than any other decent browser
[18:43:22] <grafi> :P
[18:43:26] <Velveeta> the equivalent of mouseleave, in a touch environment
[18:43:42] <Velveeta> i'd argue that it's a hell of a lot better than firefox
[18:43:52] <Velveeta> for one thing, each tab runs in a separate process with its own memory space
[18:44:12] <Velveeta> and it's much less of a resource hog than firefox is, especially with people that leave browsers/pages open for days at a time
[18:44:20] <grafi> true
[18:44:34] <Z3R0> Ok smart people... this is probably something simple, but I'm going to ask here anyways... I want to load a form... the form is "filled out and sent back" via ajax... I want to then display the returned form as a modal... how can I take the html returned and turn it into a modal form? I'm using Laravel and Bootstrap... the form will be in BS's modal form... just need to figure out what to do
[18:44:34] <Z3R0> with the returned html in order to be able to call it
[20:26:15] <raj> shoky, still here?
[20:28:44] <raj> nm
[20:32:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: still here?
[20:33:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: hey bro where are you
[21:09:57] <JoeQuery> Hello! Would anyone be interested in taking over this jquery plugin? It has 259 stars and 6 pull requests, and I'm just not feeling up to it anymore.
[21:09:59] <JoeQuery> https://github.com/joequery/Stupid-Table-Plugin
[21:16:01] <crash1hd> Hey All is it better to do $(this).parent().parent('div") or $(this).parents('div'); ??? or does it matter or make any difference?
[21:21:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> crash1hd: they are both differnt
[21:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> the first one gets the grandparent of $(this)
[21:22:26] <crash1hd> ok
[21:22:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the second the
[21:23:02] <crash1hd> right and the second one would get parent and grandparents of this
[21:23:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> all the way up
[21:23:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> to the html tag
[21:23:27] <crash1hd> right
[21:23:34] <crash1hd> so parent.parent it is then :)

[21:32:18] <tw2113> raise your hand if you've heard of Vagrant
[21:42:27] <guideX> is this valid? $(".myclass1, .myclass2 :not(.myclass3, .myclass4)") also, what if myclass1 is in the not as well ? what happens?
[21:56:58] <guideX> hmm it's not working the way I intended
[21:59:43] <guideX> i've also tried $(".myclass1 :not .myclass1, :not .myclass2")

[22:10:52] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to make it that each time the button is pressed for more fields to be added

[22:13:11] <LoneSoldier728> this is kind of hard to work with as I am pulling the data
