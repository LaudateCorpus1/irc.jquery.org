[05:08:27] <garyee> Hi, in the docs of jquery-ui for the draggable widget it says that the delay option is deprecated ... what should I do instead?
[05:17:44] <Cork> garyee: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.12/#deprecated-distance-and-delay-options
[05:29:24] <garyee> Cork: thx
[06:04:19] <Elles> Id like to change the value on the select element where option value is set to the same value as text yet
[06:04:36] <Elles> $('#id').val(defined_value).change();
[06:04:39] <Elles> doesnt work
[06:04:51] <Elles> any ideas
[06:14:13] <Elles> nvm solved
[06:46:49] <bel3atar> is $.ajax.fail() immediately called when there is no internet connection?
[07:17:08] <titii> Hello guys, Is possible to define on click function on some data-... elements, that call trigger('ajax:loadto:loaded') after ajax load (that is inicialized on document read) and create $...on('ajax:loadto:loaded', func...) in the body <script> ? Because it seems that is not called. Dont understand why?
[08:36:45] <halftroll> var foo = $('#foo'); I want to do $('#foo tr').click(funct...
[08:37:05] <halftroll> but I don't have the '#foo' string, how could I achieve that only having var foo ?
[08:38:39] <halftroll> Âˆlike reducing the scope of $('tr') only to what's inside $('#foo')
[08:39:48] <pavonia> foo.find("tr"), I think
[08:40:13] <pavonia> Err $(foo).find
[08:41:40] <halftroll> pavonia: thanks !!
[08:41:53] <halftroll> foo.find('tr') :)
[08:42:44] <pavonia> Right
[08:42:54] * pavonia is still a bit sleepy
[08:50:05] <bel3atar> is $.ajax.fail() immediately called when there is no internet connection?
[08:58:12] <bel3atar> is $.ajax.fail() immediately called when there is no internet connection?
[09:03:41] <bel3atar> when a $.ajax call fails and the options.error is set, does jQuery call .fail() or error()?
[09:21:50] <jonah> hi can anyone help. I have a jquery popup registration form here: https://www.simulant.online/ - the problem is it has form validation and the popup doesn't stay open if the validation fails, so users miss that it hasn't worked and they need to enter more details. Does anyone know how I can just keep that popup open so they know?
[09:53:56] <Deusdeorum> i am tearing my hair off here, can i not do this with .insertBefore()? .insertBefore('table > tbody > tr:first', '#myid')
[09:54:06] <Deusdeorum> it will insertbefore on wrong table
[09:54:10] <Deusdeorum> and not #myid
[09:56:51] <taplar> uh, that doesn't look right
[09:57:08] <taplar> iirc it's $thisitem.insertBefore(thisotheritem)
[09:58:04] <Deusdeorum> ok actually doing this: $('<tr><td>somehtml</td></tr>').insertBefore('table > tbody > tr:first', '#myid').css({ 'background':'#EAEAEA' });
[09:58:54] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/  it doesn't take two arguments
[10:00:57] <Deusdeorum> hmm, where did i get that from..
[10:01:15] <Deusdeorum> how can i target out table > tobdy > tr:first of #myid?
[10:01:43] <taplar> $('', '#myId')
[10:02:03] <taplar> or stick it in the selector at the front
[10:02:05] <taplar> either way
[10:03:06] <Deusdeorum> hmm,.. $('<tr><td>somehtml</td></tr>', '#myid').insertBefore('table > tbody > tr:first').css({ 'background':'#EAEAEA' });
[10:03:44] <taplar> .insertBefore('#myId table > tbody > tr:first')
[10:04:30] <Deusdeorum> yup.. sigh!
[10:04:32] <Deusdeorum> thank you taplar
[10:51:42] <puff> Good morning
[10:51:51] <anli> I do not understand how day: 31 can be in https://jsfiddle.net/t7L7xtj2/
[10:51:57] <anli> morning
[10:52:56] <anli> Is my scripting engine broken? :)
[10:54:13] <anli> ah, month has to added with 1
[10:54:17] <shoky_> anli:   month 11 is december :P
[10:54:22] <anli> lol
[10:54:29] <anli> -1 then
[10:55:05] <anli> https://jsfiddle.net/t7L7xtj2/2/
[10:55:08] <anli> thanks
[10:55:27] <anli> Such a brilliant idea to start months on 0
[10:55:36] <anli> :)
[10:56:12] <shoky_> it'd be fine if it was consistent with the others. but it's absurd that only month does, ya
[10:57:00] <anli> It would be totally absurd if everything started on 0
[10:57:25] <taplar> index vs offset, *shrug*
[10:57:45] <anli> But peoples understanding of dates is not the offset one
[10:58:03] <taplar> your a programmer.  you're not a lamen, ;)
[10:58:04] <shoky_> people don't interact with Date objects, programmers do ;P
[10:58:12] <taplar> laymen
[10:58:15] <anli> lol
[10:58:46] <anli> I am working towards minimizing the gap between nerds and anti nerds
[10:59:18] <shoky_> i'd prefer the anti nerds stay away :P
[10:59:51] <taplar> yeah, my first thought was i'd rather the nerds be damn good at what they do
[11:00:21] <taplar> but, ya know, windows beats linux right now, so, *shrug*
[11:01:36] <anli> Please, enter #linux and say that, I am bored
[11:01:44] <shoky_> for desktop usage, sure
[11:01:51] <shoky_> linux desktop sucks ;)
[11:02:01] <shoky_> for many people, at least
[11:02:14] <shoky_> + gaming
[11:03:07] <taplar> if linux was better at gaming i'd be all in linux.  only reason i keep windows around.  other than that i'm usually in a linux vm
[11:03:35] <taplar> anli: you can't argue market share, which is what my statement was about
[11:03:46] <shoky_> i got linux vm's running of course
[11:03:54] <shoky_> but, servers, not desktops
[11:04:09] <taplar> i love my xubuntu, :)
[11:05:34] <anli> linux is really good when it comes to package managers
[11:06:00] <anli> But you can also turn that statement around and say that windows is a disaster
[11:06:17] <shoky_> linux is better at that, yes
[11:06:26] <taplar> makes a lot of money.  'disaster' is relative
[11:06:30] <shoky_> i definitely wouldn't say it is really good at it
[11:12:50] <taplar> so ready for lunch
[11:17:58] <puff> What's the preferred pastebin here?
[11:18:39] <taplar> jsfiddle or jsbin
[11:18:56] * taplar points to the room subject
[11:20:54] <anli> when it comes to package managers for windows, "disaster" is descriptive
[11:21:09] <taplar> lol
[11:21:15] <anli> :)
[11:21:23] <taplar> never really used them myself in windows
[11:21:36] <taplar> you're talking about like npm, right?
[11:22:04] <anli> Well, thats a good thing
[11:22:14] <puff> http://www.darksleep.com/echo/ and http://www.darksleep.com/echo/echo1.txt and http://www.darksleep.com/echo/echo2.txt
[11:24:02] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[11:24:21] <puff> echo1.txt is the source for the index.php without the jquery, as plain text, echo2.txt is the source for index.php with the jquery.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
[11:24:43] <Uhkis> puff: you html is totally broken
[11:24:45] <Uhkis> your*
[11:25:15] <puff> Uhkis: I'm beginning to get that idea :-)
[11:26:53] <taplar> aside from that, you have at least two other issues
[11:26:55] <taplar> $('#confirmform).on('submit', function (e) {
[11:27:04] <taplar> you're missing a tick on that selector
[11:27:11] <puff> taplar: A tick?
[11:27:17] <taplar> single quote
[11:27:27] <puff> Ah.
[11:27:30] <puff> Doh.
[11:27:46] <taplar> and secondly, that logic is not in a document ready and is before your markup, meaning that selector isn't going to find anything
[11:28:43] <taplar> though a ctrl+f doesn't find that id any where in the markup either
[11:29:54] <puff> Ah, thanks.
[11:30:18] <puff> taplar: Yeah, I just built this as a test case, sorry.
[11:30:48] <puff> Also, I'm being dragged AFK, thanks.
[11:30:53] <puff> Back in a short while.
[11:41:08] <GeekMonkey> Anyone know how I could get a magnific popup to show on exit intent?
[11:41:18] <GeekMonkey> or run a script on exit intent?
[11:46:17] <surial> What is the idiomatic jquery way to fire an event when a user types something in a textbox? The keypress event has the annoying property that $("#elem").val() hasn't gotten the update yet.
[11:46:26] <surial> and .on("change") is deferred.
[11:46:59] <taplar> the value should be changed on keyup
[11:47:03] <taplar> iirc
[11:48:44] <GeekMonkey> Any thoughts for jquery exit intent?
[11:49:02] <taplar> what are you calling 'exit intent'?
[12:01:47] <surial> taplar: The right answer is to use "input" as an event, I'm pretty sure. Took a surprisingly large amount of googlin; the vast majority of suggestions involve setting up a deferred timeout which is obviously a really daft way to do it.
[12:02:06] <taplar> that's another option, sure
[12:21:33] <surial> taplar_lunch: the superior option. There are accessibility tools, there's right-click>paste, and so much more.
[12:22:47] <momomo> Hi, I am downloading some files from a server using ajax requests and throttling at 512kb/s ... There is some latency as well. And upload speed is about 200 kb/s...  The file is about 1mb big so it should take like 2-3 seconds. But each file is taking like 13-15s ... what am i missing here ?
[12:30:39] <taplar_lunch> surial: sure
[12:31:58] <taplar_lunch> momomo: if you download the file directly how long does it take?
[12:45:37] <momomo> taplar_lunch: let me check
[12:48:24] <momomo> taplar_lunch: difficult to throttle using chrome with direct file access
[12:51:17] <taplar_lunch> i dunno.  i haven't done much throttling in the browser before.  did you inspect the ajax requests to see where the time is being spent?
[13:09:42] <momomo> taplar_lunch: no, but i was missing the fact the file was not completly downloaded .. it only showed the time for when the save file dialog popped up
[13:09:50] <momomo> so it took a lot longer actually
[13:10:20] <ExoUNX> I've made some text that's below an image absolute, sometimes when I load an image or scrolling down the text will appear in the image sometimes, then fix itself, or just stay there but when I scroll back up then down again it corrects itself
[13:10:39] <ExoUNX> is there a different way I need to define lazy load? or is something technically unfixable
[13:23:43] <ExoUNX> any love :D ?
[13:23:57] <taplar> got an example of the issue?
[13:24:48] <ExoUNX> I can try...it's gonna take a minute
[13:39:23] <GeekMonkey> taplar ... exit intent = detect when leaving browser or website
[13:40:09] <taplar> leaving as in closing the browser/tab or simply going to another tab?
[13:40:57] <taplar> because iirc the former would cause on on unload event, while the later may cause a blur event to happen on the window
[13:42:58] <ExoUNX> bleh so much code to replicate
[13:59:32] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to call a function from another js file that is being loaded into the site.... the function is make_popup_visible() and the custom.js file where the function is defined is on line 200..... the I have and inline script to call that function on line 250
[13:59:40] <GeekMonkey> but it says make_popup_visible() is undefined
[13:59:43] <GeekMonkey> why?
[14:01:11] <ExoUNX> taplar here's an example - https://webmshare.com/BObgO
[14:01:26] <ExoUNX> taplar look at the first set of images, the last 2 images (text overlaps omg)
[14:01:40] <GeekMonkey> any thoughts taplar?
[14:01:55] <taplar> heh, hold on.  lots going on
[14:02:47] <taplar> ExoUNX: i can't debug a picture man
[14:03:02] <taplar> GeekMonkey: what's the scope of the method?
[14:03:47] <ExoUNX> taplar <3
[14:04:14] <GeekMonkey> let me paste it in kobra
[14:06:28] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KfSRHCGa32aMF7U3fsa
[14:06:47] <ExoUNX> taplar there is - setTimeout("$(window).resize()", 500);
[14:07:17] <taplar> first parameter of set timeout is a function
[14:08:50] <taplar> GeekMonkey: where's the source of custom.js?  that doesn't show the scope of the method
[14:08:53] <ExoUNX> taplar http://pastebin.com/vcQCv2cv
[14:09:18] <taplar> yeah, that's not valid
[14:09:26] <taplar> like i said, the first parameter is expected to be a function
[14:09:32] <ExoUNX> onclick() ?
[14:09:38] <GeekMonkey> taplar https://kobra.io/#/e/-KfSSOpT3SPk5YFAnmie
[14:09:51] <taplar> setTimeout(function(){ ... }, 500);
[14:09:59] <GeekMonkey> line 94
[14:10:28] <taplar> i'm only seeing a white screen on that one
[14:10:44] <ExoUNX> taplar I'm a bit confused, could I see a full example so I can better understand?
[14:11:15] <taplar> setTimeout(function(){ console.log("This will log after the timeout expires"); }, 500);
[14:11:46] <GeekMonkey> taplar white screen on mine?
[14:12:06] <taplar> yeah, the second one is white.  can you put these in a fiddle or something instead of being in a live stream?
[14:12:09] <ExoUNX> taplar setTimeout(function(){"$(window).resize()"}, 500);
[14:12:18] <taplar> why are you ""ing it?
[14:13:44] <ExoUNX> taplar because, why not :D
[14:13:52] <taplar> cause it's not valid
[14:13:56] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KfSRHCGa32aMF7U3fsa
[14:14:01] <GeekMonkey> I added to the first one
[14:14:02] <ExoUNX> setTimeout(function(){$(window).resize()}, 500);
[14:14:35] <taplar> ok, so look at the scope of the method
[14:15:03] <taplar> any method you define within another method, will only be accessable within that parent method or any nested method with it
[14:15:03] <GeekMonkey> taplar http://pastebin.com/RpcjHPAR
[14:15:59] <taplar> also side note, you have a document ready inside an iife.  doc readies function as iifes so you could remove the outer layer
[14:16:50] <GeekMonkey> the custom.js file can not be edited it is inside a wp plugin that I did not write
[14:18:01] <taplar> doesn't change the scope
[14:18:04] <taplar> afk a bit
[14:18:15] <GeekMonkey> afk?
[14:18:32] <GeekMonkey> maybe I am calling the wrong function.... I want the popup to load....
[14:21:20] <ExoUNX> taplar so I updated that code and still have the issue, here's the rest of the extra lazy load config - http://pastebin.com/EAGL07D9
[14:30:04] <ExoUNX> taplar is that onload bad lol?
[14:32:29] <ExoUNX> taplar $(window).load(function() { } doesn'
[14:32:34] <ExoUNX> doesn't seem to fix it either*
[14:38:19] <taplar> bak
[14:40:03] <ExoUNX> taplar wb
[14:41:13] <taplar> it looks syntatically fine
[14:45:02] <ExoUNX> well I'm using the jQuery lazy load plugin v1.9.5
[14:45:06] <ExoUNX> could that be the problem?
[14:46:06] <taplar> idk anything about the plugin.  which is why a working example of the issue would be the most helpful in debugging
[14:46:55] * puff is back.
[14:52:59] <puff> So, I'm trying to just do a very simple comfirm submit popup on an HTML form.
[14:55:48] <ExoUNX> well I think I can kind of fix it
[14:55:58] <ExoUNX> by giving it a bigger preload image
[15:44:08] <saul> hi, i'm able to handle a 'input' 'change' event, but it only fires when the focus is lost and the text has changed
[15:44:24] <saul> i havent been able to find an event to handle each change in text
[15:44:34] <saul> should i be looking for keystroke events?
[15:45:34] <taplar> input should fire any time a keystroke changes the value of the field
[15:47:10] <saul> $('#inputPrecio').on('change', 'input', function(e) { is what im  using
[15:47:24] <taplar> ooooh, that's not an input event
[15:47:30] <saul> :o
[15:47:37] <saul> it's a change event then
[15:47:40] <taplar> the second parameter there is a delegate child filter
[15:47:46] <saul> in the 'input' component
[15:47:56] <taplar> on('change input', function...)
[15:47:59] <saul> i see
[15:48:05] <saul> i'll give that a shot
[15:49:21] <saul> cool i see it firing, but now since im not grabbing the child i gotta do a .find() i imagine
[15:50:02] <taplar> is inputPrecio not the input element?
[15:50:51] <saul> no, it's a <div id> that surrounds the input element
[15:50:58] <taplar> k
[15:51:02] <saul> the input element has its own id property, which hope to grab with find
[15:51:13] <taplar> or put that in as the child filter
[15:51:55] <saul> hmm
[15:52:11] <saul> ah yes taplar, i can still include the second parameter and save a line of code
[15:52:17] <taplar> :)
[15:52:25] <taplar> then e.target or 'this' should be the element
[15:52:27] <saul> yep
[15:52:39] <saul> instead of doinf $(this).find('#childid").val etc
[15:52:57] <taplar> yup, though if you were going to do that i'd suggest just $('#childid') instead
[15:53:07] <taplar> spelled correctly of course
[15:53:13] <saul> thx a lot
[15:53:20] <saul> hmm
[15:54:05] <saul> http://pastebin.ca/3781933 that's what i ended upw ith
[15:54:49] <saul> works and is more succinct
[15:55:21] <taplar> you could do just this.value if you wanted and save a wrapping.  also i wonder if you could do without the change event
[15:59:17] <saul> im not sure what you mean
[15:59:29] <saul>     $('#inputPrecio').on('change input', 'input', function(e) {
[15:59:31] <saul> oops
[15:59:44] <saul>     $('#inputPrecio').on('input', 'input', function(e) { <- you mean just input instead of change input ?
[15:59:59] <taplar> $(this).val() could be just this.value
[16:00:03] <saul> oh
[16:00:39] <taplar> and yeah, that too
[16:00:56] <saul> i see what you mean there
[16:01:00] <taplar> i can't think of a case where an input would not trigger a change event after focus is lost
[16:01:01] <saul> i had never seen it without the $() wrapping
[16:01:12] <taplar> vanilla js, :)
[16:01:12] <saul> and you are right, because its change AND input it's triggering twice
[16:01:23] <saul> the $() is jquery ?
[16:01:26] <taplar> yep
[16:01:44] <saul> the line is blurry for me hehe
[16:01:49] <saul> between vjs and jq
[16:02:05] <taplar> anything that uses $ is jquery
[16:06:23] <taplar> lol, actually i think i thought of one
[16:06:52] <taplar> if you change the value and change it back before losing focus, i don't think it'd fire a change event.  derr
[16:07:38] <saul> i agree with you
[16:07:43] <saul> but im only using the input event now
[16:08:01] <saul> as soon as the user changes the value, i will use it to calculate values for other fields
[16:08:11] <saul> (think price * qty = subtotal)
[16:08:29] <saul> but im gonna have to do validation myself instead of just relying in <input> options
[16:08:43] <saul> because afaik those only work when focus is lost ?
[16:08:44] <saul> maybe im wrong
[16:09:04] <saul> yeah they only check once you leave
[16:11:18] <taplar> validation as in the jqueryvalidation plugin?
[16:12:37] <saul> no
[16:12:47] <saul> i was going to do my own validation, perhaps with regexps
[16:12:58] <taplar> ah
[16:13:16] <saul> like if it doesnt match the money regexp i would just blow off the user's input and do nothing until they satisfy the regexp
[16:13:28] <saul> i have the spell for money regexp somewhere in my notes
[16:13:34] <saul> incantation whatever you wanna call it :P
[16:14:16] <taplar> you might take a look at the validation plugin.  iirc they have a built in validator for money
[16:14:33] <saul> ok
[16:15:24] <taplar> or i'm a lier
[16:15:37] <taplar> i see credit card, phone number and a few others, but not money.  :(
[16:19:26] <saul> odd, money is fairly important in modern civ :D
[16:19:33] <saul> especially if you're dealing with credit cards, lol
[16:33:31] <arosen> I was wondering what the best way to take user input (say like a chatbox) and then display it on the screen is?
[16:34:08] <taplar> is this an actual live chatbox?
[16:34:15] <arosen> yes
[16:34:30] <taplar> so it's using something like long polling or websockets?
[16:34:39] <arosen> taplar:  websockets
[16:35:05] <taplar> then, imho, you simply send the message out and let the response put it in the chatbox like all other messages
[16:35:34] <arosen> taplar:  i'm more wondering how to handle parsing the input to ensure it doesn't contain any html elements?
[16:35:44] <taplar> oh
[16:36:03] <taplar> well for that you can either encode it or use text() to put it in it's parent element
[16:36:34] <taplar> text(), unlike html(), will not evaluate the html and instead creates a textNode for insertion into the dom
[16:38:37] <arosen> taplar:  so on the clientside i can call text() on the user input before it's sent to the server. I'm wondering though on the server side what i should do to handle the input?
[16:39:15] <taplar> no, text() would be used to put it on the page, not clean it before sending it
[16:39:18] <arosen> i suppose i could also call .text() on the client side when the clients pull down the new message. But i was hoping i could also handle this at the server side too just in case i missed a spot in the client.
[16:39:35] <taplar> in that case it's not a jquery issue, :)
[16:40:31] <arosen> taplar:  should i be escaping and of the data on the server side before sending it to the client?
[16:40:37] <arosen> or in general is that not really something that people would do.
[16:40:49] <taplar> that's up to you and your business case
[16:42:02] <taplar> but definitely any cleaning you need to do should be done on the backend.  though most people suggest doing backend and frontend just in case some how data gets into the db without being cleaned
[16:45:04] <arosen> taplar:   what method would one user to convert a string into text?  I know i could do : $("...").append(data).text() but i was thinking after i convert it to text i'd add some html into it before adding it to the page.
[16:45:24] <taplar> a string is text
[16:45:53] <arosen> taplar: i was more meaning a string that could have html elements in it
[16:46:05] <taplar> that are not interpreted?
[16:46:53] <arosen> right, i don't want user input html to be rendered if they put that in a textbox.
[16:47:01] <arosen> once it's added to the screen.
[16:49:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dfvx2ct5/
[16:50:00] <arosen> taplar:  i'm  wondering why this ins't actually being processed as html? http://pasteboard.co/KDvZ3UZAc.png
[16:51:18] <arosen> see how the color inside the the  class='message-text' div is all black? Any idea why this is?
[16:51:29] <taplar> did you create that data with text()
[16:51:30] <taplar> ?
[16:54:23] <arosen> taplar:  hrm, that was added to the screen using the library that calls linkifyStr(message) which is called before the element is added to the screen to make any links in the text clickable.
[16:54:30] <arosen> i guess that must call text() on it.
[16:54:44] <taplar> or it creates the textNode itself
[17:04:06] <arosen> taplar:  i'm wondering how i would go about converting/decoding a string like this:
[17:04:07] <arosen> "Sure,&#xA0;<div><br></div><div>when would be &#xA0;a good time for you to come see it?&#xA0;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,&#xA0;</div>"
[17:04:07] <arosen> To something that i can add to the screen in a human readable way?
[17:05:42] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3745666/how-to-convert-from-hex-to-ascii-in-javascript#3745677 possibly
[17:05:59] <arosen> I'm wondering if i should strip out all the <div> tags and replace <br> with \n. Then, i convert this to text() and call  replace(/\r?\n/g, '<br />') before adding it to the screen.
[17:06:07] <arosen> thanks, i'll check that out.
[17:56:27] <puff> So, I'm trying to do a simple html form with a jquery ui popup "Confirm save" dialog.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/276fcec582629b5efcd12724e56a1623
[17:56:36] <puff> I get the popup on page load, not on confirm.
[17:57:12] <puff> I've looked, but I haven't been able to find a simple example that does the whole thing, i.e. both the dialog and the HTML form and not submitting if the user doesn't click yes.
[17:57:28] <puff> If anybody can point me at such an example, I would appreciate it.
[17:59:46] <taplar> your document ready looks incorrect
[18:00:18] <taplar> $(document).ready(function(){ ...your stuff... });
[18:02:33] <puff> Thanks, fixed, and hm... syntax error on the close.
[18:02:43] <puff> One second while I fix that.
[18:11:41] <puff> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/675e93981367a4db080afb004253b1eb
[18:11:56] <puff> Chrome devtools doesn't like how I"m closing that jquery expression.
[18:12:15] <puff> taplar: By the way, can you confirm that this is basically the right way to do it? Or am I so far off the beaten path...
[18:12:23] <taplar> which one?
[18:12:36] <taplar> you still haven't fixed the document ready
[18:12:43] <puff> taplar: I thought I did?
[18:12:52] <taplar> not in that last link
[18:13:01] <puff> Line 32?
[18:13:03] <taplar> line 32 is still invalid syntax
[18:13:17] <puff>  $( document ).ready( function() {
[18:13:28] <taplar> i don't see the function there
[18:14:19] <puff> You don't see the above on line 32?
[18:14:36] <taplar> nope
[18:14:42] <puff> Weird.
[18:14:53] <taplar> oh wait, i may be looking at the old tab
[18:14:55] <taplar> :/
[18:14:59] <taplar> bah
[18:15:16] <taplar> alright
[18:15:26] <puff> Ah
[18:15:43] <taplar> yeah your doc ready isn't closed
[18:15:44] <puff> I'm going cross-eyed trying to make sure I closed all of the {} and () properly :-(
[18:16:13] <taplar> i'd recommend using a paste service that offers a tidy option
[18:16:24] <puff> Any particular one you like?
[18:16:24] <taplar> it will indent things to show you if things are unclosed
[18:16:27] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[18:17:33] <puff> Doh, I just realized one stupid mistake.
[18:17:56] <puff> I orignally had this as just a single page, then I made a directory...but the form actions still pointed back to the single page.
[18:18:16] <puff> I'm using emacs webmode, but I guess it's not up to the challenge.
[18:19:00] <puff> Hm, jsfiddle seems to want me to break up the HTML and javascript into separate panes... can I just paste it all into the HTML pane?
[18:19:40] <taplar> it's better to stick each piece in it's block.  you can click the javascript label in the top right corner of it's section to choose options of how it is included in the result
[18:20:26] <taplar> if you're more comfortable with using another pastee site thats fine.  i was just suggesting that one for the tidy.  you could use the tidy and then take it back to your other pastee
[18:21:18] <puff> https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/
[18:21:36] <puff> I'm fine using it, I just generally prefer my testing/dev to be as close as possible to the real thing, i.e. all in one page.
[18:21:50] <puff> Or is there some way for jsfiddle to export it all as one page?
[18:22:19] <puff> s/all in one page/something I can just upload to a webserver htdocs and it will work/
[18:22:19] <taplar> no it's not meant to build a complete result.  it's just used to test the pieces and it puts them all in the bottom right block
[18:22:37] <puff> Ah.
[18:23:10] <taplar> what ide do you use if any?
[18:23:20] <puff> Emacs, intellij.
[18:23:43] <taplar> hmm, i'd have though intellij would suggest to you when javascript syntax is incorrect
[18:24:43] <puff> It says "statement expected".
[18:24:50] <puff> So, not the most helpful of messages.
[18:25:06] <puff> Hm, so I can't uplod the jquery libraries I'm using.
[18:25:11] <taplar> you still haven't closed your doc ready block
[18:25:31] <taplar> the javascript options has a lot of the jquery libraries available to choose
[18:25:34] <puff> I haven't evne gotten that far, trying to finish converting my one page to jsfiddle.
[18:25:55] <puff> Which javascript options?
[18:26:15] <taplar> see the Javascript <cog icon> in the bottom left area?
[18:26:26] <taplar> click that guy
[18:28:53] <puff> Hm, what does update do?
[18:29:19] <taplar> it saves the fiddle in it's current state and the url will change so that you can link itout
[18:29:38] <puff> Ah, so save just saves under the current url, update creates a new one.
[18:29:56] <taplar> no, save is when it has never been saved before
[18:31:31] <IRCFrEAK> d
[18:32:13] <puff> ah.
[18:34:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:34:42] <robertmaxrees> that guy
[18:34:46] <taplar> ?
[18:35:04] <puff> Hm: https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/3/
[18:35:05] <robertmaxrees> had a dude doing join/quit spam, sent "d" once, then did it some more.
[18:35:08] <robertmaxrees> then got k-lined
[18:35:12] <taplar> ah
[18:35:23] <taplar> i have those filtered out
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> puff why do you have jquery and jquery ui-cc included twice?
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> *css
[18:35:50] <puff> robertmaxrees: Because I'm learning jsfiddle :-)
[18:35:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:36:34] <puff> Those are being served off my personal website, which has a self-signed SSL cert, will that cause problems?
[18:36:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:37:02] <puff> Ah, okay, guess I'll add them via the javascript pane, then.
[18:37:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c4wv6kbv/4/
[18:37:08] <robertmaxrees> here ;)_
[18:37:31] <puff> Looks like the javascript pane doens't have 1.8.1.
[18:37:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c4wv6kbv/6/ with some unnecessary tags removed.
[18:37:46] <robertmaxrees> are you using deprecated features?
[18:37:50] <puff> jsfiddle is neat.
[18:37:56] <puff> I don't know.
[18:38:13] <robertmaxrees> 1.9 should be fine.
[18:38:18] <puff> I'm working on a legacy app and they want to add some (extra) jquery popups and the like.
[18:38:30] <puff> So I'm (trying to) learn jquery.
[18:39:11] <puff> They're already using jquery and jquery UI for some stuff, hence trying to stick to the same versions.
[18:39:27] <robertmaxrees> as you should.  should be fine with 1.9 in this case.
[18:39:45] <puff> Should I remove the links to the stuff on my server?
[18:39:53] <robertmaxrees> i already did in the last version.
[18:40:11] <puff> Ah, okay.
[18:40:36] <puff> Why is jsfiddle highlighting some HTML tags in red? </FORM>, </H2>, etc.
[18:40:50] <robertmaxrees> <h2>GET link test</H2>
[18:40:53] <robertmaxrees> mismatch in case.
[18:40:57] <puff> I'm guessing that means jsfiddle thinks there's something wrong with them... ah.
[18:41:16] <robertmaxrees> you can safely ignore those for now.
[18:41:19] <puff> And </FORM>?
[18:41:45] <puff> OK.
[18:42:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c4wv6kbv/8/
[18:42:05] <robertmaxrees> it was the uppercase tags.
[18:42:12] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't get hung up on those for now.
[18:42:20] <puff> ok
[18:43:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c4wv6kbv/9/
[18:43:05] <robertmaxrees> this defines a success function for you.
[18:43:25] <robertmaxrees> ooooooh. i see what you're trying to do.
[18:43:46] <robertmaxrees> ignore that one :)
[18:44:03] <robertmaxrees> do you see where this quickly falls apart?
[18:44:22] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm keep ignoring me.
[18:45:45] <taplar> i'm not sure what the issue is any more
[18:45:59] <puff> Well the main issue is that I don't know what I'm donig.
[18:46:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:46:04] <puff> But I'm working on that <rimshot>
[18:46:45] <puff> So I'm just trying to make a form that, when you click the button, pops up a confirmation dialog (e.g. "are you sure you want to save?" ) using jquery-ui dialog.
[18:47:11] <robertmaxrees> looks like you've got that working, no?
[18:47:16] <puff> Seems like a good little starter project, and I have a few form buttons that could use a confirm.
[18:47:28] <puff> I'm not sure, when I click the "save" button in jsfiddle, nothing happens.
[18:47:42] <taplar> the second form, the one you are binding on, does the modal
[18:47:44] <robertmaxrees> because the form can't really submit heh
[18:48:15] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, taplar is right.  the second form works.  that's the one you're binding to.
[18:48:44] <puff> The GET form?
[18:48:46] <puff> doh...
[18:48:55] <puff> So busy looking for complicated problems, I missed the obvious problem.
[18:49:00] <taplar> :)
[18:49:01] <puff> I put the id on the wrong form :-)
[18:49:47] <robertmaxrees> you sure you don't want a class for that instead?
[18:49:52] <robertmaxrees> so you can more easily re-use that?
[18:49:55] <puff> For which?
[18:50:05] <puff> Okay, so now when I click "Save", I get the popup... but clicking yes/no doesn't make the popup go away.
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> the confirm code?
[18:51:20] <puff> Ah, yeah, a reusable class would be a good idea.
[18:51:50] <puff> Any other improvements come to mind?  Also, is this approach the sane approach, etc?
[18:52:02] <puff> Am I making any egregious mistakes of idiom or common practice?
[18:52:12] <taplar> i'm worried about your modal method
[18:52:26] <puff> taplar: About it being a modal dialog?
[18:52:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:52:36] <taplar> you're creating a new modal every time
[18:52:40] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[18:52:40] <puff> Ah.
[18:52:45] <robertmaxrees> i was about to point that out.
[18:52:55] <puff> Okay, so instead...
[18:53:30] <robertmaxrees> think about it.
[18:53:38] <robertmaxrees> what would make sense there?
[18:54:02] <puff> Well, can I extract it to a separate file?
[18:54:06] <puff> And just load/use that?
[18:54:10] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:54:22] <puff> I'm not really sure why.
[18:54:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean, ideally this would just be apart of the page html.
[18:54:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of creating it.
[18:54:29] <puff> I stopped keeping up with html around the time they added the blink tag.
[18:54:33] <puff> Ah.
[18:54:42] <taplar> there's a blink tag?
[18:54:46] <puff> So is there some way to put it in the page HTML source but make it invisible.
[18:54:49] <puff> taplar: There was.
[18:55:00] <puff> taplar: Everybody decided that was a bad idea and agreed to never speak of it again.
[18:55:01] <taplar> there's a blink tag and they killed the marquee tag?  wtf?
[18:55:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:55:24] <robertmaxrees> other way around.
[18:55:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n5jeyw40/
[18:55:53] <robertmaxrees> so puff
[18:55:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[18:56:01] <puff> Yeah.
[18:56:03] <robertmaxrees> hit "view source" at the bottomthere.
[18:56:16] <puff> That's actually where I started this foray.
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> see how the html is just on the page?
[18:56:29] <robertmaxrees> makign it a modal hides it.
[18:56:38] <puff> Ah...
[18:56:40] <puff> Cool.
[18:57:15] <taplar> brb i gotta get off my slow azz vpn
[18:58:45] <taplar> yeah much better
[18:59:28] <puff> Cool.
[18:59:41] <puff> robertmaxrees: Okay, so lemme just move that around...
[19:01:01] <puff> robertmaxrees: And then I change the jquery line to something like? var confirmdialog = $('#confirmdialog').dialog({
[19:01:06] <puff> https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/13/
[19:01:23] <puff> Hm, apparently not quite.
[19:02:39] <puff> Ah,had to go at the bottom, so jquery had a chance to run.
[19:02:51] <puff> I forgot all about fun, wacky HTML page load sequencing.
[19:03:08] <puff> Okay, so it still doesn't go away when I click yes/no.
[19:03:24] <puff> Is that just because it's on jsfiddle, or does that suggest something's wrong?
[19:03:47] <puff> Yikes, the snow is pounding down, outside.
[19:05:55] <taplar> glad i'm not there
[19:07:50] <puff> Ohyeah.... http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/pittsburgh-pa/weather-radar
[19:10:31] <puff> There's a huge blizzard, stretches from down past Pittsburgh up, northwest to cover the western half of lake erie.
[19:10:43] <puff> Time to buy milk, bread, ducttape and plastic!
[19:15:37] <puff> Hm, so do I need to wrap a document ready around the "function confirmDialog() {etc" bit now?
[19:17:43] <puff> Hm, the html for the popup isn't being hidden.  https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/15/
[19:18:51] <puff> "$( function() {" is just shorthand for "$(document).ready(", right?
[19:29:38] <puff> Ah, it doens't close because somewhere along the way, the $(this).dialog("close") lines were commented out.
[20:00:10] <jquerynewbie> join
[20:00:20] <jquerynewbie> test
[20:00:27] <robertmaxrees> test
[20:01:13] <jquerynewbie> anyone know jquery plugins/library to change default input?
[20:01:39] <robertmaxrees> to what?
[20:02:20] <jquerynewbie> like "name" only a-z and space
[20:02:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean to validate the input?
[20:02:35] <robertmaxrees> restrict it?
[20:02:51] <jquerynewbie> when user click 0-9 or other doesnt make change
[20:02:59] <jquerynewbie> like jquery input mask
[20:03:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want form validation.
[20:03:11] <jquerynewbie> jquery validation?
[20:03:17] <robertmaxrees> no need for jquery.
[20:03:22] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation
[20:03:43] <robertmaxrees> you can polyfill for browsers that don't support native validation.
[20:03:51] <jquerynewbie> hmm.. not validation
[20:04:03] <jquerynewbie> my validation on server-side
[20:04:16] <jquerynewbie> but just to make user input friendly
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> can you clarify then?
[20:04:48] <jquerynewbie> when "number" only 0-9 can be clicked in form
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> typed?
[20:05:21] <jquerynewbie> when "name" only a-z or A-Z and space can be filled in form
[20:05:23] <jquerynewbie> nah
[20:05:37] <jquerynewbie> yes i mean typed
[20:06:11] <robertmaxrees> native form validation can give you that.
[20:08:05] <jquerynewbie> like this --> https://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/
[20:08:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't need a plugin to do that.
[20:09:17] <jquerynewbie> when user typing in "date" form, only key "0-9"
[20:09:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:15:52] <fearnothing> hola
[20:16:01] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[20:31:24] <puff> Hello.
[20:33:13] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[20:42:50] <saul> i've got this super annoying problem where the widths of my text inputs keep changing when i change other elements on the page ...
[20:42:57] <saul> but the text inputs are mostly empty anyway ...
[20:44:09] <puff> robertmaxrees: Question, should I wrap both of these jquery calls in the same document ready, or keep them in separate document ready calls as they are now?
[20:44:21] <puff> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/20/
[20:45:16] <Alturic> Hey guys, I'm outputting an array from PHP via json_encode. I'm then manually settings variables like so: https://jsfiddle.net/hmm0rfr3/ (there is one alert on pageload) and I'm wondering if there's anyway (or if it's even best-practive to do it, but I'm wondering if I can iterate over the json array and set each   var laborNAMEHourly via a loop. Now, I'm sure some of my code looks bad, but
[20:45:16] <Alturic> I'm still learning jQuery. :-/
[20:46:24] <puff> Alturic: welcome to the club :-)
[20:46:37] <Alturic> Personally, I hope my var directCosts is decent code because it's pretty nice calling items that way, heh.
[20:47:49] <robertmaxrees> puff i only see one document ready in that fiddle >.>
[20:48:43] <robertmaxrees> Alturic huh?
[20:48:55] <robertmaxrees> Alturic first off, there's no array there.
[20:49:04] <robertmaxrees> those are js object.
[20:49:14] <Alturic> robertmaxrees That's a json array?
[20:49:24] <Alturic> Oh. :-/
[20:49:54] <robertmaxrees> also, why do you need to set vars?
[20:50:01] <robertmaxrees> way lost as to what you're really trying to do.
[20:51:13] <robertmaxrees> Alturic this data is kind of awkwardly structured.
[20:51:25] <robertmaxrees> you have an object of objects whose names are the same as their name propties.
[20:51:28] <robertmaxrees> *properties.
[20:51:36] <Alturic> robertmaxrees: I have the json_encode up top getting output from PHP. Of course what I have shown is trimmed down, but then I use the direct_cost in the json_encode for calculations.
[20:51:50] <robertmaxrees> also: why is direct cost a string?>
[20:51:51] <Alturic> robertmaxrees Well, that's kinda why I'm asking what I'm asking. So as an example.
[20:51:52] <robertmaxrees> why not a number?
[20:52:15] <Alturic> Ok, to answer that first. I really don't know what you mean by that?
[20:52:25] <Alturic> arrayDirectCostsLaborHourly is output via PHP, json_encode.
[20:52:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a js array.
[20:52:35] <puff> robertmaxrees: Doh, yeah, at one point I had both functions wrapped in document ready.
[20:52:47] <Alturic> So how would I set direct_cost as a number when jQuery first reads it essentially?
[20:52:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't reading any of this Alturic
[20:53:18] <robertmaxrees> puff either way, no need to wait to define the function until doc ready. what you have there is fine.
[20:53:26] <robertmaxrees> Alturic https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmm0rfr3/1/
[20:53:35] <robertmaxrees> this format makes more sense, though then you'd need to modify the code.
[20:53:35] <puff> okay.
[20:53:47] <puff> Hm, if I *do* wait, then the popup is displayed on page load.
[20:53:53] <robertmaxrees> puff huh?
[20:54:08] <puff> Er, if I *do* wrap the first function def in a document ready, it displays the popup when I click "run".
[20:54:16] <puff> https://jsfiddle.net/c4wv6kbv/21/
[20:54:19] <Alturic> robertmaxrees: When you say modify the code, I presume you mean the directCosts section?
[20:54:26] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:54:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use doc ready.
[20:54:37] <robertmaxrees> and that code doesn't work.
[20:54:41] <puff> 'kay...
[20:55:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5y3qcpy5/ ius what you're trying to do.
[20:55:10] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't work.
[20:55:15] <puff> robertmaxrees: I was trying to figure out why it displays the dialog text at the bottom of the page when I click run.
[20:55:18] <robertmaxrees> because the confirmDialog isn't available in that other scope.
[20:55:24] <Alturic> robertmaxrees: And that's where I fail at arrays. How would I then set var laborWideDeckHourly's direct_cost?
[20:55:36] <puff> Maybe I shouldn't put any text in the dialog HTML, populate it in the jquery call?
[20:55:40] <robertmaxrees> Alturic why are you setting an array for that?
[20:55:42] <robertmaxrees> puff no.
[20:55:50] <puff> That is, don't put the text in the static html at the bottom of the page.
[20:56:44] <robertmaxrees> really depends on how you plan to use this.
[20:56:51] <Alturic> I'm unsure what you're asking... what array? The arrayDirectCostsLaborHourly, or the directCosts function?
[20:57:09] <robertmaxrees> err, variable.
[20:57:11] <robertmaxrees> not array, sorry.
[20:57:19] <puff> robertmaxrees: In what sense?
[20:57:32] <robertmaxrees> puff do you plan on making this reusable?
[20:57:35] <Alturic> If you mean the arrayDirectCostsLaborHourly, because it's a MySQL return on the PHP side. So to get it to jQuery I'm json_encoding the array.
[20:57:43] <puff> robertmaxrees: Sure.
[20:58:00] <puff> robertmaxrees: I would prefer to do that, if it doesn't make things way more complicated.
[20:59:05] <Alturic> robertmaxrees: Ok, let me try not to confuse the hell out of you any more. I have an array of MySQL rows from PHP. To get it to jQuery the (only?) way I know how is to json_encode it, unless I literally set variables via PHP in <script> tags?
[21:00:49] <Alturic> So, I have the array from PHP to where jQuery can access it. That is the first object (as you said it's called?), I then need to set variables for the items inside of that object, to use in calculations. So if I wanted to get the hourly labor cost + a 200% markup, I currently would do: directCosts.laborWideDeckHourly * 2 giving me 30.
[21:01:27] <Alturic> Err, directCosts.laborWideDeckHourly() * 2 giving me 30.
[21:01:39] <Alturic> Are you saying that's extremely crazy? :-/
[21:04:33] <Alturic> And I followed "The Module Pattern" to design the var directCosts code from here: https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/concepts/
[21:09:39] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a bit.
[21:10:18] <robertmaxrees> Alturic aaaand i gotta jet.
[21:10:24] <robertmaxrees> sorry!  good luck folks.
