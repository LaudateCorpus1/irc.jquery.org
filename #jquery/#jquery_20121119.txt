[00:05:20] <vlad_starkov> Question: what tools do you use for generating fake data in your tests? I found out Faker.js so far.
[00:05:46] <javalover> hey guys I have a php question but i'm banned from #php
[00:06:15] <andrewgroff> javalover: what is the question?
[00:08:10] <javalover> well...i have this login script
[00:08:29] <javalover> and I want to know like...if I say "include" is that enough for it to run the login script?
[00:08:42] <javalover> or do I have to put everything into a function say include & then run the function?
[00:09:08] <andrewgroff> if you include it it will be executed
[00:09:17] <javalover> ok so that's cool..
[00:09:38] <javalover> aight this should work
[00:09:45] <javalover> a bit confusing when i first look at it..but I think it'll work
[00:10:03] <javalover> this is actually the very first thing i've ever tried via someone being logged in
[00:10:32] <andrewgroff> yea, authentication can be a tricky thing to do yourself
[00:11:35] <javalover> well i have a good auth..i'm just combining them
[00:11:42] <javalover> that's why it's confusing
[00:12:16] <javalover> on it's own the script works fine i'm just merging stuff together
[00:13:28] <javalover> yeah ok so that's my question
[00:13:35] <javalover> if i call .load("postthis.php");
[00:13:46] <javalover> then it'll just call everything in the php & post it?
[00:14:44] <javalover> seems like I just do that, in a function for the action listener of my button on click
[00:15:10] <andrewgroff> if you call .load('postthis.php') it will send an ajax request to postthis.php and take the output of that script, and stick it into whatever element you had selected
[00:27:42] <nobitanobi> Good morning. What would be the correct way that, when a checkbox in a form is checked I want to hide an input, but also clear its value so when the form is submitted that value is empty?
[00:29:52] <karstenk1977_> what could be the reason, that jQuery(this).outerHeight(); return the Object and no int???
[00:30:25] <monosym> hey, i have a quick question....looking for some advice about how to control a slider input via a scroll event: http://jsfiddle.net/volvox/BXKt6/1/
[00:32:25] <Mento> hey guys how do i change the SRC of an iframe when selecting and option in a dropdown list?
[00:48:10] <ItsJustMe> I have several divs .. How would you try to paginate them? My problem is that I filter the divs live and the Pagination has to reload after every filter.
[00:48:44] <aqeel> ItsJustMe: use on() instead of live()
[00:49:17] <ItsJustMe> I just meant that I filter them and need to update the pagination. Sorry for that (:
[00:49:25] <ItsJustMe> I use keyup ^^
[00:50:33] <timforgach> Hello everyone. I had a general quesiton about extending a jQuery plugin. Could anyone give me their opinion?

[00:51:38] <aqeel> ItsJustMe: http://flaviusmatis.github.com/simplePagination.js/
[00:52:15] <aqeel> ItsJustMe: http://beneverard.github.com/jqPagination/
[00:52:23] <aqeel> hope that simplifies everything
[00:53:36] <ItsJustMe> So I call $(selector).pagination() on every keyup?
[00:53:57] <ItsJustMe> simplePagination ...
[00:54:32] <aqeel> yes
[00:54:47] <ItsJustMe> okay, cool
[00:54:53] <ItsJustMe> Thought it would be harder :D
[00:55:11] <ItsJustMe> I want to understand it anyway later :)
[00:55:31] <Mento> hey guys im trying to open a form action in a lightbox using an iframe.. but IE opens a new window after hitting submit - any other browser works fine. Any ideas?
[00:55:39] <aqeel> onPageClick(pageNumber).....selectOnClick......onInit.....options are there too
[00:57:22] <aqeel> have you sspecify the page property...like _blank,self,target
[00:57:35] <aqeel> Mento: ^^
[00:57:51] <Mento> yes i specified the target to my iframe ID :)

[01:18:18] <mediascreen> i dont get it sorry
[01:19:35] <aqeel> that is the console error i get maximum....i do not receive any other error
[01:20:06] <mediascreen> does the functionality work in your browser?

[01:25:23] <mediascreen> toggle
[01:25:25] <TheBrayn> thanks
[01:25:42] <mediascreen> if you press on the "Details anzeigen »" button
[01:25:52] <aqeel> site is not in english i might not be of much help
[01:26:49] <mediascreen> let me rename it :)
[01:27:14] <mediascreen> if you may refresh
[01:27:58] <aqeel> no it is not working
[01:28:21] <mediascreen> you get no error , but the example code on jsfiddle is working... any idea what could cause this?
[01:28:27] <mazzachre> I have a list of elements that contain an input[type=checkbox] and I want a click on the list item to toggle the selected status of the input element, how to do that?
[01:29:10] <aqeel> well room i am sorry .... got to be going now....see you later
[01:29:29] <aqeel> .toggle()
[01:29:35] <aqeel> mazzachre: ^^
[01:30:01] <BinaryKitten> mazzachre ignore aqeel on this. .toggle toggles visibility
[01:30:24] <mazzachre> ya
[01:30:54] <BinaryKitten> mazzachre  $(selector).attr('checked', (checkthem?'checked',null));
[01:31:17] <BinaryKitten> be careful though of other hooks on those checkboxes
[01:31:39] <BinaryKitten> in the example checkthem is a predefined variable that is either true or false
[01:31:59] * BinaryKitten departs for the office
[01:32:18] <BinaryKitten> ooh actually sorry
[01:34:11] <mediascreen> BinaryKitten, you got any idea what could cause my problem?
[01:40:51] <BinaryKitten> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/xLXES/
[01:41:06] <BinaryKitten> sorry for the delay.. chrome decided to die half way through
[01:41:32] <BinaryKitten> i've used a checkbox to control it mazzachre but you could use any true/false
[01:41:53] <BinaryKitten> mediascreen sorry no clue as to what your problem is.. and also i'm late for work

[03:04:45] <xsamurai> I was under the impression that live was to be replaced by on, but when I changed my click events from live to on , they stop functioning http://jsfiddle.net/zY5Sq/1/
[03:06:36] <dogmatic69> xsamurai: http://jsfiddle.net/zY5Sq/2/
[03:06:40] <dogmatic69> works for me.
[03:08:13] <xsamurai> yeah for some odd reason "on" doesnt work on elements which are part of a sub template and included in the main template
[03:12:11] <dogmatic69> update maybe?
[03:14:28] <PoG> anyone had experience with Masonry JS and resizing on the fly ie, a drop down menu or summat INSIDE one of the mason'd boxes?
[03:15:01] <Haprog> not me
[03:15:14] <xsamurai> dogmatic69: im using latest
[03:15:14] <PoG> well played  ;)
[03:15:24] <Haprog> :P
[03:15:31] <xsamurai> for now i'll use live and when I get time i'll figure out why on isnt working
[03:15:34] <dogmatic69> xsamurai: 1.9.x?
[03:15:46] <xsamurai> guh, i thought it was 1.8.3
[03:19:50] <ItsJustMe> a111
[03:19:53] <ItsJustMe> sry :D
[03:20:02] <ItsJustMe> lay on my keyboard xD
[03:25:09] <ItsJustMe> Why is my function not available if I declare it within the .ready()-function?
[03:25:27] <ItsJustMe> I mean on an onclick event .. :)
[03:43:06] <ItsJustMe> Is there someone out there? :D
[03:43:39] <zsoc> not generally
[03:44:12] <ItsJustMe> do you know jQuery good? ^^
[03:44:32] <ItsJustMe> zsoc :)
[03:44:42] <zsoc> not really
[03:44:50] <zsoc> I don't have to tho, I only have to know it better than you to answer a question
[03:44:51] <ItsJustMe> okay ..
[03:45:29] <fRAiLtY-> lol
[03:45:35] <ItsJustMe> I think it is a beginners mistake .. So you should know it good enough ^^
[03:46:01] <ItsJustMe> I just cannot access my function, defined in the .ready() function of jquery, later in the document.
[03:46:09] <ItsJustMe> Do you know what that could be?
[03:46:56] <zsoc> You don't know how .ready works, you're not access JQuery properly, or your function is set up wrong. Or you're accessing it and it's not doing what you're expecting. Should I just keep guessing?
[03:47:00] <zsoc> Maybe a jsfiddle would be nice
[03:49:16] <ItsJustMe> http://jsfiddle.net/GatheringXP/7JPAn/

[04:05:23] <syd_> hello
[04:06:01] <syd_> anyone had an issue where after you append html inside an element then the source changes ? (random a tags are being generated on their own...)
[04:09:34] <Jon47> syd_: nope, sounds like user error somehow
[04:09:56] <abletony84> I'm trying to rotate a couple of boxes using jQuery Cycle: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/9J6cM/ (with some JS to set a proper width after jQuery Cycle messes it up)
[04:10:00] <abletony84> But why, when I include css3-mediaqueries.js, does it set the width to a whopping 33737px? http://home.no/dwaynie/test/
[04:10:04] <syd_> it's really wierd i can't figure it out
[04:10:16] <syd_> i console.log the source code before the append
[04:10:18] <syd_> and it's ok
[04:10:49] <syd_> and then when i console.log the same code from the element that i appended it, it's not the same
[04:11:02] <syd_> it has random a tags in it

[04:47:15] <aqeel> hi room
[04:47:35] <aqeel> .text("1. a \n 2.b");
[04:47:42] <aqeel> \n is not working
[04:47:57] <aqeel> still shows on sme line
[04:48:46] <malydok>  try: .text("1. a"+ \n+" 2.b");
[04:49:38] <vlad_starkov> Question: Could someone recommend a lib for comparing to JSONs? (like json_spec but for testing in JS/Coffee)
[04:51:08] <aqeel> malydok: it is jquery error
[04:51:17] <aqeel> cannot write like that\
[04:51:51] <malydok> yep, just tried it
[04:52:31] <aqeel> so how to resolve this issue
[04:53:53] <malydok> I've searched for the problem and what I've found is: "There are some workarounds on the API page, but perhaps the text() method isn't best suited for what you want to do?"
[04:54:33] <aqeel> but i have no other choice...html replaces my element
[04:54:33] <malydok> there is no newline character in HTML
[04:54:40] <malydok> <br />
[05:01:48] <mazzachre> How can I make the list items "look right"(tm) here? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/6V5G8/2/
[05:03:08] <mazzachre> I have list items with floated elements, and obviously the items become 0 height, I have then tried to clear: both on the list item, but it becomes "odd" as in, I have no idea what is happening!
[05:04:02] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:04:08] <aqeel> this does not work too
[05:05:46] <aqeel> sorry correct link http://jsfiddle.net/nKHYc/
[05:17:02] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/nKHYc/1/
[05:17:06] <aqeel> how about this
[05:38:06] <TheBrayn> what alternatives are there for .html( something ) to replace things on a site?
[05:38:27] <TheBrayn> I'm loading stuff with ajax which would work with load but I want to do some more stuff if it succeeds
[05:38:35] <mazzachre> I have a list containing checkboxes, I want to select the checkbox when clicking on the list item as well as if clicking on the checkbox. Currently I have added a click handler to the li, but then when I click the checkbox nothing happens (or rather, it is checked, then the handler is run unchecking it, since it is a toggle thing) what to do?
[05:38:56] <aqeel> guyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyysssssssss....simple solution.....add css white space:pre; to the element that needs /n and bingo it works like a charm
[05:40:15] <harrydog> how do i get a specific key in an array of elements that belong to a certain class? like $(".my-class") and get the 1st, or 3rd, element etc
[05:40:40] <dogmatic69> $('.foo')[0/1/2/3] etc
[05:41:09] <seutje> harrydog: want the DOM element or the jquery collection?
[05:41:34] <harrydog> jquery element i think, because i want to get another data-src attribute from that element
[05:41:43] <seutje> ?eq
[05:41:44] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:41:53] <harrydog> thanks
[05:41:54] <seutje> (0-indexed)
[05:41:58] <seutje> iirc
[05:42:28] <harrydog> works like a charm, ah, so easy with jquery
[05:47:48] <jasper^off> hej guys, if I do a $( '#accountinfo' ).on('click', 'a', function() { ....how can I then inside that function retrieve the id of the clicked a ?
[05:49:21] <mazzachre> jasper^off: RTFM: $(this).attr('id') would do it!
[05:49:56] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/j29ye/1/ How can I make the checkbox work when clicking itself? It now works when clicking the rest of the li
[05:53:46] <seutje> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/j29ye/2/ prolly not the best solution though
[05:54:32] <seutje> but I really didn't want to clean up the rest
[05:54:58] <mazzachre> seutje: Ya, thx.
[06:00:49] <jasper^off> guys, $( '#accountinfo a' ).on( 'click' , function() { should just work right?
[06:01:00] <jasper^off> it should react on every A inside the #accountinfo ul ?
[06:02:39] <jasper^off> never mind, fixed it
[06:03:41] <aqeel> yes it should
[06:05:22] <seutje> consider using $('#accountinfo').on('click', 'a', function(){}); instead

[06:24:57] <Menashe> yeah, i tried that, but the image is not responding
[06:25:12] <Menashe> i tried slidedown and toggleSlide
[06:28:55] <Menashe> can anyone help?
[06:29:47] <TheBrayn> you will have to provide an example

[06:32:06] <bot-t> Menashe, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:35:03] <Menashe> how do i add my image to jsfiddle?
[06:36:03] <shoky> just link to a dummy image e.g. http://placekitten.com/200/200  or upload your image somewhere if you want
[06:36:17] <shoky> or just leave it as a broken image, probably fine
[06:36:58] <marcogmonteiro> hi there, is there a way to clone a html element that contains a form but keeping the value and the :selected elements?
[06:37:08] <ItsJustMe> How can I detect the length of a result-set? After filtering :)
[06:37:30] <shoky> ItsJustMe: .length ?
[06:38:10] <astropirate> Hello all
[06:38:19] <marcogmonteiro> hi there.
[06:38:47] <astropirate> marcogmonteiro, you should be able to do it with just  $(myform).clone()
[06:38:56] <astropirate> i'm not too sure about that though
[06:38:59] <marcogmonteiro> that's what I using
[06:39:17] <astropirate> marcogmonteiro, and it's not working?
[06:39:21] <marcogmonteiro> and that does not keep the selected values on <select> elements and so forth
[06:39:30] <astropirate> hmmm
[06:39:42] <marcogmonteiro> also checkbox that are checked
[06:39:48] <Menashe> ok, i have my demo on jsfiddle
[06:39:50] <Menashe> http://jsfiddle.net/TVddd/
[06:40:02] <Menashe> can't get that image to slidedown and reveal text
[06:40:08] <marcogmonteiro> those are my main problems checkboxes and select fields
[06:40:18] <dmcdaniel12> anyone have any experience using $.noConflict() and $.ajax together?
[06:40:30] <ItsJustMe> shoky: yeah, I thought about it .. But how do I save this value? $(".offer_webspace").show().filter(function(i, el) { return blaaah; }).hide().length();
[06:41:02] <shoky> ItsJustMe:  var length = $(".offer_webspace").show().filter(function(i, el) { return blaaah; }).hide().length;
[06:41:26] <marcogmonteiro> astropirate I'm going to try some of this solutions I think that will do
[06:41:26] <marcogmonteiro> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3250685/is-there-a-way-to-clone-form-field-values-in-jquery-or-javascript
[06:41:46] <astropirate> marcogmonteiro, alright good luck!
[06:41:48] <ItsJustMe> okay, thx .. just thought i could avoid double filter ^^
[06:42:00] <Menashe> TheBrayn are you still there?
[06:42:56] <Menashe> or can someone else help me?
[06:45:40] <Aamir> Menashe: $(".box-1-image") has no content
[06:46:31] <Menashe> it has to have more than a background image?
[06:48:17] <shoky> Menashe: http://jsfiddle.net/TVddd/1/
[06:48:23] <Aamir> Menashe:  which you say $(this).slideDown();  it won't work because it has no content   <div class="box-1-image"></div>
[06:48:38] <shoky> it has a background image
[06:48:55] <Menashe> yeah, the css gives it dimensions and background

[07:36:58] <softmanpetro> there is any create event in jquery ?
[07:37:12] <softmanpetro> live.("create"...
[07:37:57] <sethetter> softmanpetro: To create elements you can do $("<div class='something'>Blah</div>")
[07:38:07] <softmanpetro> no
[07:38:23] <softmanpetro> I want to listen when a element appear and fire a action sethetter
[07:38:40] <softmanpetro> like here http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-create-event/
[07:40:06] <john__> .
[07:40:27] <sethetter> softmanpetro: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:40:30] <john__> can you give me the link to jquery?
[07:40:33] <john__> that file
[07:40:41] <john__> i dont know the link
[07:41:00] <faraway> softmanpetro: no there is no such event, because the DOMNodeInserted event is not widely supported right now
[07:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: yes
[07:41:50] <sethetter> softmanpetro: the load event works but only if the elements contain something with a url
[07:42:12] <NoiseEee> http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion @ softmanpetro
[07:42:40] <zafu> hi, can I count children in a jq selector? i.e. pseudo-code -> 'only select element if it has only 1 child'
[07:42:52] <softmanpetro> so it can pe a 1px nothing which later call a ajax to present a download
[07:42:56] <softmanpetro> :) ?
[07:43:18] <sethetter> zafu: yes, you can return the children of an element and test the length for 1
[07:43:46] <zafu> sethetter: can I express that inside a $(...) ?
[07:44:23] <sethetter> zafu: Hmm.. Not that I can think of.
[07:44:36] <softmanpetro> thx
[07:46:15] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: i updated the PR content, i seem to have made an error in my pasting
[07:46:57] <sethetter> zafu: wait! THere's a trick actually
[07:47:17] <sethetter> zafu: $("ul li:first-child:last-child")
[07:47:45] <sethetter> zafu: If there's only one child it will be the first and last child, i wasn't sure if you could combine psuedo selectors like that though.
[07:48:01] <deadalus> hello i have minor problem with my code: http://pastebin.com/MPEnsFFF
[07:48:07] <sethetter> zafu: http://jsfiddle.net/ysLBJ/
[07:48:36] <zafu> sethetter: nifty, but I'd like to select the element _only_ if it has one child (at most)
[07:49:15] <deadalus> the gist is, im trying to select a h2 tag nested within a parent element using $(this).siblings('h2').text(), but i always get an empty value in return
[07:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: This one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/829/files
[07:49:28] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by sgharms (10h, 30m ago): Menubar
[07:49:29] <sethetter> zafu: Sounds like you will just have to test the length of the children array
[07:50:06] <zafu> oh, I count use :not()
[07:50:11] <scalex000> hello, guys
[07:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: In regard to your comment about mouseenter firing before click, You can "click" elements without the mouse.
[07:52:39] <sethetter> deadalus: Your click handler is targeting the parent "packages" div, so it wouldn't be a sibling you are grabbing
[07:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: I'm getting very confused by your comments on that PR.
[07:53:20] <scalex000> I need help, with some issues
[07:55:49] <deadalus> sethetter; what would be the best way to grab the text of a child element with a click handler??
[07:57:52] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez:
[07:58:05] <sgharms> let me try that again
[07:58:28] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez:
[07:58:32] <sgharms> agggggg
[07:58:38] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: what's the issue
[07:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: I see your new comment, I replied.
[08:00:28] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: reading...
[08:01:33] <deadalus> sethetter: nvm, i figured it out. i used find('h2') instead of siblings('h2'), thx.
[08:01:56] <sethetter> deadalus: np, sorry was afk for a moment. that would be the way I'd suggest though

[08:03:30] <sgharms> when one uses that._on() as you suggest, the context in which the handler is sought ( click: <this thing> ) in the 'that'
[08:03:45] <iiicubed> hello all...
[08:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: The context inside _on() is always the widget instance, so yes.

[08:04:41] <Caelum> how do I put a .click handler on a disabled radio button? it just ignores it

[08:09:28] <danmichel> I'm trying to set the height of each .relatedthumb li here http://nybodyart.com/artist/silvano-fiato/ based on the height of the tallest one. thanks in advance for any help
[08:09:57] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: The reason I ask about the chant for that is because at (yes, now right URL) https://github.com/sgharms/jquery-ui/blob/82d0056451393a1af7f9924b1ede6baf50489b09/ui/jquery.ui.menubar.js#L92-L93 I want to take the event callbacks and DRY out the _on() call.  So that it would look like that._on({ "click.menubar": mouseEventCallback, "focus.menubar": mouseEventCallback })
[08:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: Then they just belong inside the prototype.

[08:14:03] <sgharms> will adjust unit test PR and will continue work on bind -> _on()
[08:14:53] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: after today i won't be able to look at it until Dec 1, leaving for Maui tomorrow :)
[08:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, have fun :-)
[08:15:28] <firstclassfunc> File.js contains "var x = "{one:1, two:2};" -- I just want the object and don't need it to be added to the global scope. Is there a way to do this without converting it to json manually
[08:15:44] <sgharms> i have to leave my computer on the other side of an ocean to actually relax, so there you have it :)
[08:17:58] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: nope
[08:20:42] <firstclassfunc> pifantastic: no way really?
[08:21:38] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc:  there are some silly hacks that you could probably do, but JSON sounds like the proper answer to your problem. Converting JS to JSON is easy though.
[08:22:11] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: you can copy paste the JS into Chrome console and just do JSON.stringify( <copy pasted object> );
[08:22:17] <pifantastic> and then copy that out and back into the file
[08:22:38] <pifantastic> You don't have to go through an entire file converting it manually to JSON
[08:23:07] <pifantastic> and then use jQuery's getJSON  to load it
[08:23:55] <firstclassfunc> pifantastic: alrighty, thanks. Didn't know that about chrome, but I have used the crockford's json utility. I suppose I could just read it in as text and use stringify
[08:24:25] <pifantastic> Crockford's JSON.js is now supported by all modern browsers
[08:25:11] <firstclassfunc> how modern are you talking?
[08:26:36] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: http://caniuse.com/#feat=json
[08:27:08] <firstclassfunc> ok cool
[08:30:12] <firstclassfunc> pifantastic: one more thing.. I want to store functions and that is not allowed in JSON. Do I really have no other option?
[08:30:57] <pifantastic> ?xy @ firstclassfunc
[08:30:57] <bot-t> firstclassfunc, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[08:31:27] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: what are you trying to accomplish?
[08:33:11] <firstclassfunc> pifantastic: I have an object that contains functions that I want to retrieve with $.ajax
[08:33:32] <systemfault> o_O
[08:33:51] <systemfault> Smells like hack
[08:33:54] <firstclassfunc> JSON doesn't permit functions afaik, so I have no option other than to use getScript and have my object added to the namespace
[08:34:15] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: correct. And you don't need $.ajax, you can use getScript
[08:34:49] <firstclassfunc> Ideally I would call $.getScript and jQuery would give me a new scope with that object, I'll do whatever I want with it, and it will NOT be added to the global scope
[08:36:08] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: it sounds like what you really want is AMD
[08:36:16] <pifantastic> ?g requirejs @ firstclassfunc
[08:36:18] <bot-t> firstclassfunc, RequireJS - http://requirejs.org/
[08:37:48] <firstclassfunc> I've used that before.. ugh I suppose. Didn't really care for requirejs
[08:39:24] <someprimetime> require is tight
[08:39:34] <pags> super tight brah
[08:39:37] <someprimetime> unless you minify and concat everything anyway
[08:39:47] <someprimetime> pags: nah tight like denims
[08:39:52] <someprimetime> actually maybe tight like bras
[08:39:54] <firstclassfunc> it's not bad but I had issues with it
[08:40:59] <pifantastic> firstclassfunc: it solves *exactly* the problem you have
[08:41:34] <norbert_> hey all, I'm running into a "TypeError: $.curCSS is not a function" error
[08:41:45] <norbert_> I checked Google and found some related pages, but nothing helped
[08:41:59] <norbert_> has to do with this http://jsfiddle.net/theodin/pXgLf/
[08:42:15] <norbert_> works with jQuery 1.4.4, but I would like to use the latest jQuery, which apparently doesn't support $.curCSS...
[08:42:20] <norbert_> any ideas? :|
[08:42:29] <gnarf> norbert_: switch to jQuery.css instead
[08:42:32] <someprimetime> background-position
[08:42:48] <gnarf> norbert_: same function since like 1.5 - curCSS was never documented/supported
[08:42:51] <someprimetime> wait nm
[08:43:41] <firstclassfunc> pifantastic: I know, blah
[08:44:35] <norbert_> gnarf: I'm only using that person's code http://jsfiddle.net/theodin/pXgLf/
[08:44:58] <christo_m> Is there some sitewide jquery i can use (for all forms on site) that will pop up an alert when you try to leave a page with a form before submitting?
[08:45:03] <norbert_> gnarf: don't really know what to do... I tried renaming curCSS to css in the animate-bg.js file that's being included there
[08:45:10] <norbert_> but it doesn't fix the problem...
[08:45:25] <norbert_> maybe his code is too outdated and more or less beyond fixing
[08:45:54] <gnarf> he's duck punching animate
[08:45:59] <gnarf> this is not the right way to solve it
[08:47:12] <christo_m> I basically want to listen to all forms on a site for non submit events and notify the user that their information will be lost if they leave, and allow them to stay on the page
[08:48:41] <gnarf> norbert_: give me a minute, you just want animation support for background position ?
[08:49:04] <norbert_> gnarf: what it's doing on the bottom right at http://jsfiddle.net/theodin/pXgLf/ :)
[08:49:26] <t432> I came across this line in a forum but I was unable to see any var with same names as defined so i was wondering if the following line is part of jquery function? "${pageContext.request.contextPath}"
[08:49:31] <norbert_> I think it's a pretty nice menu and not too much code to pull it off, it seems
[08:49:46] <gnarf> norbert_: have you tried animating background-position-x and background-position-y instead ?
[08:50:08] <gnarf> because animate by default can only work with a single value property
[08:50:22] <gnarf> bgpos x and y should handle that for you
[08:50:28] <mr_orange_> anyone can help me? have problem with css and dynamic content feede by getJson request
[08:50:30] <gnarf> and i think its supported pretty much everywhere
[08:50:44] <gnarf> ?ask @mr_orange_
[08:50:44] <bot-t> mr_orange_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:51:10] <t432> anyone?
[08:51:12] <gnarf> in other words, noone will respond to "anyone can help me" but if you just ask the problem - you'll have better luck :)
[08:51:38] <gnarf> t432: not with ${}
[08:52:01] <t432> without?
[08:52:02] <mr_orange_> have a web page with a button when clicked it will fire a json request that return some info then i add this info on the page but css styling it's not apllied
[08:52:27] <mr_orange_> I'm going mad
[08:52:50] <gnarf> norbert_: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/pXgLf/133/
[08:53:02] <gnarf> mr_orange_: see ?demo
[08:53:02] <bot-t> mr_orange_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:53:17] <norbert_> gnarf: it's not my code, so I have no idea what do to... I'm just a user looking for a nice menu and I think this one looks nice :) I need to replace something in animate-bg.js with background-position-x and -y ?
[08:53:32] <gnarf> norbert_: no, throw that crap for animate-bg away
[08:53:48] <gnarf> just animate backgroundPositionX and backgroundPositionY instead
[08:54:01] <gnarf> afaik that will work for everything
[08:54:16] <t432> let me put it another way .... if your using a framework like spring for development, are you able to get the contextpath to the page you are interested in via jquery without the need to hard code the location of page?
[08:54:41] <gnarf> t432: huh?
[08:55:12] <t432> i have my answer :)
[08:55:16] <gnarf> t432: jQuery can't know anything not in the document / ajax
[08:55:27] <t432> yea
[08:55:28] <gnarf> t432: it doesn't have magic powers
[08:55:37] <gnarf> put the url to your other service in a data-* attr
[08:55:39] <gnarf> of some element
[08:55:47] <gnarf> then you can read it via jQuery
[08:59:59] <norbert_> gnarf: I tried what you mentioned here http://www.popot.org/test/
[09:00:17] <norbert_> gnarf: the dev console gives no errors, but it doesn't work yet, it seems
[09:00:22] <gnarf> norbert_: works in chrome
[09:00:27] <gnarf> where is it broken for you?
[09:00:34] <norbert_> Firefox 16.0.1
[09:01:15] <gnarf> damn FF
[09:03:59] <andrew9184> i'm using a jquery plugin for doubletap which allows for two callbacks, one for double click and one for single click in the syntax $.doubletap( double(), single() );  how can I make it so double() only runs once for the first time its clicked, other than making a flag for it?
[09:04:42] <digitalice> Hello, I would like to know how can I detect if any field of a form changed! I'm trying to add it here: http://pastebin.com/AByMUGqr
[09:04:53] <hlve> Hey guys, what would be the best way to create a function to say "When checkbox #1 is checked, check checkbox #2" ? http://jsfiddle.net/xK7h5/
[09:05:19] <NoiseEee> digitalice: you'd probably be interested in monitoring the "change" event of the forms inputs
[09:05:52] <norbert_> hlve: if the user checks #1, you can use onclick
[09:05:57] <digitalice> NoiseEee: will try that
[09:06:43] <gnarf> norbert_: does it look right in chrome/safari/ie for you?
[09:06:51] <hlve> norbert_, but that won't work if a user checks and then unchecks
[09:07:26] <norbert_> hlve: you can check the status of the checkbox at the onclick event
[09:07:31] <gnarf> norbert_: try including this and see if it fixes firefox: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[09:07:35] <norbert_> hlve: see for example http://www.electrictoolbox.com/check-uncheck-checkbox-jquery/
[09:08:49] <gnarf> hlve: $("#box1").change(function() { $("#box2").prop( "checked", this.checked ); });
[09:09:08] <hlve> Thank you gnarf <3
[09:09:13] <hlve> much appreciated.
[09:09:25] <norbert_> gnarf: yes, that fixes it
[09:10:41] <norbert_> gnarf: thanks; is that some kind of workaround for FF?
[09:13:48] <gnarf> norbert_: apparently FF doesn't support backgroundPosition(X|Y)
[09:13:56] <norbert_> ok
[09:14:17] <gnarf> so it injects a jQuery.cssHook for it to use backgroundPosition instead: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js#L40-L55
[09:14:48] <koopajah> Hey everyone! I have a question about jQuery's droppable functionality. I'm working on a grid like document. When I try to move a line between two other lines I temporary add a "fake" div between both line (in the over() callback). The problem is doing so, the drop() event is not called anymore (maybe because my line does not intersect properly with the other line anymore. can anyone help me
[09:14:48] <koopajah> please?
[09:16:30] <norbert_> gnarf: thanks again
[09:17:28] <str8uplinux> could someone help me loop through table cells using .click()? http://jsfiddle.net/8t5Lc/
[09:18:05] <MalMen> anyone know some good function to auto complete hour for example i have an input [     ] when i start to insert hour [23   ] the input automatic have [23:0 ] and check if the hour is correct
[09:18:08] <gnarf> koopajah: gonna need to see that problem - see ?demo
[09:18:08] <bot-t> koopajah, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:18:55] <gnarf> MalMen: there is a jQuery UI widget being worked on called mask that could help - there is also timepicker:  http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/
[09:19:05] <gnarf> check out mask and timepicker
[09:19:11] <koopajah> gnarf > that's a bit hard to provide a working demo in jsfiddle or something :( I was hoping that someone could understand the problem without it ^^
[09:21:54] <koopajah> gnarf > It looks like modifying the grid while being in draggable state messes with the droppable functionality
[09:23:33] <gnarf> MalMen: both are unrelased widgets, but you should be able to just grab the js files and use it
[09:27:43] <someprimetime> sup gnarf
[09:27:52] <Caelum> can you do something like: var my_win = window.open(...); $(my_win.document).ready(function() { ... });
[09:28:07] <charco> Hey! I have a question regarding infinite-scroll .. for some reason it seems to ignore the "next page" link when fetching the second page >.<
[09:30:01] <gnarf> someprimetime: not much - you?
[09:30:21] <someprimetime> just got to work super early and converting some stuff over to backbone
[09:31:09] <someprimetime> coworkers are like 'you're here early' i'm like 'damn straight'
[09:32:50] <charco> Also, I've tried running the tests pages from the github repo of infinite-scroll and it doesn't work >.<
[09:37:08] <str8uplinux> could someone help me set up previous and next links to loop through table cells? This is what i have working so far -->http://jsfiddle.net/8t5Lc/
[09:39:10] <MalMen> $('input[class=hour]').keypress(function(event) { how can i get the value of the current input ?
[09:39:12] <brettster> str8uplinux why are you doing it this way
[09:39:24] <str8uplinux> what "way"?
[09:39:50] <str8uplinux> brettster: i am open for suggestions
[09:40:01] <khinester> i am having difficulties in seeing why the accordian text for the H3 is not aligned with the arrow but is on the next line, see http://www.associationtsunami.org/ you will need to turn the cube 2 times to the right
[09:41:03] <royalty> hello how can i specifically reference a div element that are is 2 children down from another element which can be referenced by $("foo")
[09:41:18] <brettster> str8uplinux - use this
[09:41:18] <brettster> http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/
[09:42:18] <brettster> okay?
[09:43:02] <airdem> isnt there any :hover selector?
[09:43:11] <brettster> .hover()
[09:43:27] <airdem> i want to change the css hover properties
[09:43:31] <someprimetime> MalMen: http://jsfiddle.net/QWmKj/
[09:43:46] <lduros> hi, I've set a ul containing lis as sortable
[09:43:52] <kborchers> str8uplinux: this might get you on the right track, though, i probably wouldn't use a table for this but that's just me. http://jsfiddle.net/8t5Lc/2/
[09:44:01] <lduros> using jquery ui, now I would like to run a callback whenever something has been dropped
[09:44:09] <Caelum> how do you check if a field value is different from the original value=""
[09:44:10] <lduros> can I do it from this: $("#image-list").sortable();
[09:44:13] <jacobroufa_> hey room
[09:44:18] <someprimetime> ? eq() @ royalty
[09:44:22] <someprimetime> hmm
[09:44:30] <someprimetime> eq() ? @ royalty
[09:44:36] <someprimetime> did i forget how to use bot-t o.O
[09:44:39] <lduros> I guess my question is: is there a way to set a callback on $("#image-list").sortable() whenever the list is rearranged
[09:44:42] <brettster> khinester
[09:44:42] <someprimetime> royalty: $('foo').eq(1)
[09:44:44] <airdem> brettster, like this $(...).hover(self.css(..)) like this?
[09:44:52] <brettster> cool concept
[09:44:57] <brettster> awful usablility
[09:45:03] <someprimetime> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:45:45] <str8uplinux> kborchers: thanks! that deffinitely helps! I know tables aren't great, but it the only way i can find to center pictures prefectly in my div.
[09:46:11] <airdem> brettster, theres no $('#menu a:hover') selector to change the hover css settings?
[09:46:18] <kborchers> lduros: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[09:46:27] <someprimetime> lduros: .sortable({change: onChange}); then onChange is your callback function
[09:46:28] <lduros> kborchers: thanks
[09:46:32] <lduros> ah cool
[09:46:34] <lduros> that's great
[09:46:37] <lduros> someprimetime: thanks
[09:48:04] <lduros> someprimetime: change is triggered whenever you are moving the element around, not when it's dropped only though
[09:48:25] <someprimetime> sortable({sort: onSort});
[09:48:49] <lduros> yeh
[09:48:49] <lduros> ok
[09:48:57] <lduros> I thought beforeStop might do it too
[09:48:58] <someprimetime> not sure though I don't use it
[09:49:33] <someprimetime> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-option
[09:49:36] <someprimetime> look @ events
[09:49:40] <kborchers> lduros: that's why i sent you the update event doc â€¦ it happens after sorting is done
[09:49:59] <lduros> ok sort triggers many times... beforeStop does the trick
[09:50:09] <lduros> kborchers: someprimetime: thanks to you both
[09:50:12] <lduros> yeh
[09:50:12] <lduros> ok
[09:50:35] <lduros> update works too
[09:52:17] <str8uplinux> kborchers: any good hints on how to detect the last image and auto display the first-child again?
[09:53:24] <royalty> someprimetime: thanks
[09:54:18] <someprimetime> royalty: see also nth-child selector http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[09:54:34] <someprimetime> which you can pass odd/even into
[09:54:41] <charco> has anyone used inifinite-scroll? I'm having some issues trying to use it on a web
[09:55:03] <someprimetime> i'm pretty sure with 908 members in here, someone has used itâ€¦ post up a fiddle perhaps?
[09:55:14] <kborchers> str8uplinux: off the top of my head you could just check the length of the object returned by next() but i have to head out
[09:55:35] <str8uplinux> kborchers: i appreciate the help!
[09:56:44] <khinester> brettster: yes UI is an issue, but for now i need to get a working design as the festival is in two weeks time
[09:57:00] <brettster> why not pay someone to do it.
[09:57:04] <brettster> this is awful.
[09:57:06] <MalMen> someprimetime thank you very mutch :)
[09:57:19] <brettster> like really - no one will be able to access the information
[09:57:24] <MalMen> its possble to check if $(this) is a breakspace ?
[09:57:25] <brettster> it's really a cool concept.
[09:57:30] <brettster> but it's not usable.
[09:57:34] <gnarf> ?eq @someprimetime
[09:57:34] <bot-t> someprimetime, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/

[09:58:03] <someprimetime> oh is it because i had a damn space?!
[09:58:05] <someprimetime> and ()
[09:58:14] <someprimetime> bot-t: you sexy little robot
[09:58:15] <bot-t> someprimetime, Is that a question?
[09:58:22] <someprimetime> no it's a damn statement
[09:58:48] <tw2113> bot-t, it's not obvious?

[10:04:11] <tw2113> transition: all 100ms ease-in-out 0s;
[10:04:19] <tw2113> on ul#thumb-list li img
[10:05:04] <tw2113> is my guess
[10:06:07] <BillCriswell> chandu: 100ms is very fast.
[10:07:25] <chandu> in css ?
[10:07:55] <dns-away> jquery
[10:08:17] <chandu> yea but i cant find the line where this is :s
[10:10:59] <chandu> its in css
[10:11:38] <lduros> is it possible to use $li.eq(number) to move a li in a ul? or is this done differently?
[10:12:16] <lduros> I want to move an item as the third li by doing currentLi.eq(2);
[10:12:21] <lduros> not sure if that would work
[10:14:28] <chandu> hello ?
[10:14:30] <jrodl3r> http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[10:14:39] <chandu> i changed that to 10ms still doesnt work

[10:15:36] <lduros> though, would I have to remove the one at the initial location?

[10:20:16] <jrodl3r> does that help?
[10:23:15] <ravenzz> is it fine to have a "global" variable to use within each()? eg var elem; foo.each(function () { elem = $(this); });
[10:24:15] <ravenzz> specially when this variable is also shared by an event handler: bar.on("burp", function (e) { elem = e.target; });
[10:24:15] <jrodl3r> u could just return it
[10:24:29] <ravenzz> what do you mean?
[10:24:47] <jrodl3r> elem = whatev.each(function(){â€¦..});
[10:24:56] <jrodl3r> â€¦. + return whatev...
[10:25:11] <ravenzz> uhm I don't need to return actually..
[10:25:48] <jrodl3r> right. i don't think there's anything wrong with that, i could be wrong tho.
[10:26:02] <ravenzz> it is to avoid: foo.each(function () { var elem = $(this); }); bar.on("burp", function (e) { var elem = e.target; });
[10:27:19] <jrodl3r> i think u kinda have to make it global because you
[10:27:23] <jrodl3r> re using it in handlers
[10:27:47] <jrodl3r> i would check it out tho
[10:28:13] <ravenzz> there is nothing wrong with the latter, also js variables are cheap buut
[10:28:24] <JessC> looking at the code it appears that when you use it in that way it is just going to overwrite the previous value in the loop
[10:28:27] <JessC> until it reaches the end
[10:28:30] <ravenzz> I was wondering if it is fine to let them share the variable
[10:29:07] <jrodl3r> share?>
[10:29:41] <ravenzz> JesseC noone need the variable within the loop to be there forever :) when the iteration is done nobody is gonna use it
[10:30:47] <JessC> @ravenzz I guess I am not sure what you are trying to do exactly. But yes you can reference a variable outside the scope and you won't have any problems
[10:30:47] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE trying to do exactly. But yes you can reference a variable outside the scope and you won't have any problems
[10:33:14] <ravenzz> JessC http://pastie.org/5402386
[10:34:09] <jrodl3r> ya dude. that's fine
[10:34:12] <jrodl3r> what's the fear?
[10:34:18] <ravenzz> the event
[10:34:33] <jrodl3r> that elem will be out of scope?
[10:34:40] <JessC> @ravenzz That'll work fine
[10:34:49] <jrodl3r> it's global
[10:35:11] <jokoon> is there a function that wrap something into a <p></p> ?
[10:35:13] <ravenzz> say that something asynchronous will put a value in elem while an each() iteration is not done yet
[10:35:23] <someprimetime> ?wrap @jokoon
[10:35:23] <bot-t> jokoon, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/

[10:54:15] <Caelum> well $.ajax(url, { type: 'POST' }) didn't work for me at all, so I did a get with $.param
[10:54:27] <lduros> i may have an idea... hold on
[10:54:34] <Caelum> I have no idea why
[10:54:39] <MistuhKurtz> I gotcha. My interest was piqued
[10:57:11] <chandu> no soluttion at all cant believe it man
[10:57:58] <Carlitta87> hi....i was wondering if there are any jquery script that will break up text and do a slide?
[10:58:04] <tw2113> it's likely from the plugin you're using chandu
[10:59:15] <MistuhKurtz> Carlitta87, could you please explain better
[11:00:02] <chandu> tw: yea but no option for that
[11:00:12] <tw2113> not our fault
[11:00:16] <chandu> is there any way i can overwrite a query
[11:00:26] <chandu> but there is no click action on it also
[11:00:29] <chandu> which is wierd
[11:00:52] <tw2113> contact the plugin author? they'd know more about it than us
[11:01:17] <chandu> why
[11:01:41] <tw2113> because they'd be the best source of info/debugging on their own work?
[11:01:53] <chandu> great
[11:02:06] <mib_mib> hi guys - i'm using the standard 'google analytics' way of appending a javascript to the page by finding the first 'script' element, then appending it before this: var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x); ...  - however, for some reason my javascript is getting called over and over by facebook and google on the page
[11:02:19] <chandu> supersized is a jquery script though
[11:02:23] <chandu> they using the same one
[11:02:27] <tw2113> it's a jquery plugin
[11:02:28] <mib_mib> is there a better way to do this?
[11:02:28] <chandu> even in their demo this happens
[11:02:36] <tw2113> 3rd party
[11:03:14] <chandu> will they respond fast ?
[11:03:18] <tw2113> no idea
[11:03:27] <chandu> do you make plugins tw ?
[11:03:30] <tw2113> i have 1
[11:03:36] <tw2113> and nowhere near as complex as that one
[11:03:54] <chandu> as which one
[11:04:09] <tw2113> all mine does is hit up the twitter API and display tweets :D
[11:04:10] <chandu> are you expert
[11:04:20] <chandu> oh ok
[11:04:43] <chandu> its good
[11:04:49] <chandu> but lot of competition
[11:05:21] <chandu> my firequery is enabled don't know how to use it
[11:06:23] <tw2113> one of many reasons i'm not going to author my own slideshow plugin any time soon
[11:06:32] <tw2113> i'd be one in a billion
[11:09:45] <chandu> ?
[11:11:54] <Caelum> how come window.open doesn't work from an .ajax success handler?
[11:14:23] <royalty> hello is it ez to incorporate regexp with a selector?
[11:15:08] <royalty> suppose there are elements with classes .magic1 .magic2 .magic3 .magic4 .magic5 and there is a .magic
[11:15:19] <royalty> is there a way I can select them all in one selection
[11:15:31] <royalty> without selecting the plain .magic
[11:16:35] <royalty> can I do something like $(".magic[1-5])"
[11:16:39] <royalty> oops
[11:16:42] <royalty> you get the picture
[11:19:04] <mib_mib> hi guys - how do i know if an event happens async (like $.ajax) or happens immediately?
[11:21:33] <zakelfassi> royalty : there should be â€¦ but not as you described it. You could try  $(".magic" + [1-5])
[11:22:03] <zakelfassi> logically, $(".magic[1-5])" should select the class name magic[1-5]
[11:22:52] <royalty> ok
[11:24:10] <royalty> zakelfassi: no i guess there isn't oh well
[11:24:58] <WebDragon> nice, 1.8.3
[11:27:39] <monokrome> Hey. Does anyone here have a recommendation for a grid? I have used jqGrid before, but don't like the documentation. SlickGrid looks nice, but also lacks much documentation. Are there other options with inline editing that anyone might recommend?
[11:28:00] <zakelfassi> royalty: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/ here you go !
[11:28:28] <zakelfassi> royalty: try this â€¦ seems to do the job.
[11:29:14] <zakelfassi> monokrome: Why don't you just use Bootstrap ?
[11:29:39] <zakelfassi> monokrome: unless you're talking about a data grid :3
[11:29:58] <someprimetime> foundation zurb > bootstrap
[11:30:07] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/ykdeZ/ Cannot read property 'string' of undefined, what's wrong with this?
[11:31:03] <Scott0_> what happens if I initiate 15 ajax requests
[11:31:17] <Scott0_> will they queue properly or fail after a certain count?
[11:31:37] <JLT> You could try it Scott0_ see what happens? :P
[11:31:57] <Scott0_> I will be, just curious
[11:32:01] <zakelfassi> Scott0_: Try to use Deferred objects.
[11:32:10] <Scott0_> there's some work to get to that point,, no need in doingthat work if there will be a problem
[11:33:21] <Scott0_> was going to use .getJSON
[11:34:01] <monokrome> zakelfassi: Yeah, I'm talking about a data grid. Sorry for the ambiguity there. I use http://semantic.gs for my CSS grids.

[11:35:50] <suppp> hey guys, i'm looking for a good open source Web 2.0 Calendar Wiki , pref based on jQuery, and would like something flexible, that doesn't depend on any particular back end technology ( working with Rails )
[11:35:55] <Haprog> I've used DataTables with jEditable inline editing in a few projects.
[11:35:55] <zakelfassi> JLT: For starters .. I added a div in the HTML :p
[11:35:56] <suppp> any thoughts ?
[11:36:12] <suppp> hmm not sure why i said wiki ment Widget :P
[11:36:34] <zakelfassi> suppp: Just go with JQuery UI calendar.
[11:36:42] <JLT> zakelfassi: yeah this is just a snippet that duplicates my issue, the real thing does indeed have divs :P that doesn't fix the issue tho
[11:37:00] <zakelfassi> JLT : debugging wise .. I added a div :p
[11:37:16] <charco> Infinite-scroll doesn't take the href param for the next page exactly? It seems like it's trying to parse the href param to get the next page id =/.. is there a way to set it to always use the whole href param?
[11:37:19] <suppp> zakelfassi : there is such a thing ? i just see a Datepicker in the component list. will check again then
[11:37:39] <zakelfassi> suppp: Datepicker is not calendar ? What do you mean by calendar ?
[11:37:42] <Saaether> suppp http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[11:38:52] <suppp> zakelfassi , saaether : Datepicker is no Calendar, Calendar provides additional features, and view states : http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/04/jquery-calendar-date-pickers.html . looking at that list, but seems to be out of date, i tried a few and they rely on php backends, so i figured i'd ask the community here for something up to date
[11:39:41] <suppp> mainly looking for a Calendar that lets me add and display events in the days. Having Week/Day views is an added benefit
[11:39:49] <zakelfassi> suppp: Not aware of any of these; but I guess you should build you own for the sake of everyone else :3 (you probably won't find a pixel-perfect match for your needs).
[11:40:04] <zakelfassi> suppp: Or just extend the JQ datepicker.
[11:40:04] <zakelfassi> .
[11:40:54] <suppp> zakelfassi : that's what i was thinking, but i figured i'd ask first, since most of the time i look into building my own thing, by the time i finish it someone mentiones a main stream open source solution that i havn't evaluated :)
[11:43:09] <Aero`> Hi :) Would anyone have some knowledge on WYSIHTML5 ?
[11:44:14] <Aero`> I'm using WYSIHTML5 on a textarea, but I want to load content as a value of that textarea with jquery
[11:44:14] <zakelfassi> JTL : http://d.pr/i/kysG
[11:44:26] <Aero`> I use .val() but doesn't work with WYSIHTML5
[11:44:28] <JLT> learn to spell zakelfassi but I forgive you ;P
[11:44:29] <zakelfassi> JTL : Don't ask why â€¦ options doesn't work. Defaults does :/
[11:44:44] <zakelfassi> JLT: Sorry â€¦ lol
[11:45:16] <JLT> i think I know why zakel looking at that now.
[11:45:19] <JLT> zakelfassi:
[11:45:38] <JLT> in the myplugin function, options is an argument. I am overwriting the argument via doing options = $.extend
[11:45:46] <JLT> rather than overwriting the actua l... var outside the function
[11:46:19] <JLT> yeah that's the reason zakelfassi :P so obvious yet overlooked.
[11:47:12] <zakelfassi> JLT: yup â€¦ Didn't actually notice. I'm more of a Google Closure guy  - Extending stuff comes with the package.
[11:47:52] <doughj3> can jQuery modify a dynamic element without an event?
[11:48:00] <doughj3> I know I can use .on() but I don't think that'll work for what I'm trying to do
[11:49:45] <suppp> this calendar looking quite nice , i might use this rather than just re-writting the same thing from scratch : http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[11:53:51] <zakelfassi> suppp: Indeed. Looks like a google calendar clone :p
[11:54:30] <suppp> yea most of them look like google calendar / i cal
[12:01:42] <finspin> hi guys, i cant figure out this jquery code http://jsfiddle.net/BcAa9/1/. after clicking on the paragraph id like to remove all elements. could you give me any pointers where am i going wrong?
[12:08:10] <gnarf> ATTN #jquery'ers - In a decision we hope will be best for both communities, we will be merging this channel with #jquerymobile - So if you join tomorrow and get sent there, you now know why!  Thanks!
[12:08:18] <gnarf> or rather
[12:08:26] <gnarf> if you try to go to #jquerymobile and get sent here
[12:08:28] <gnarf> whatever
[12:08:32] <gnarf> you know what I meant ;)
[12:11:12] <josePHPagoda> Hello everyone.  I'm trying to get the jqueryui tabs to work.  They function, but my styling doesn't seem to be applied. My css is loading properly however, any pointers on where I should look?
[12:12:01] <wgolden_afk> anyone know of a way to remove classes starting with a certain string from an element?
[12:12:12] <wgolden_afk> i can split it with classNames, but didn't know if there was a jquery specific way
[12:12:31] <zakelfassi> josePHPagoda: Put JS at the bottom of the page â€¦ CSS on top [header] !
[12:13:49] <zakelfassi> wgolden_afk: .removeClass() + regex ?!
[12:15:12] <zakelfassi> wgolden: I mean â€¦ $(.element).removeClass (function (index, class) {
[12:15:13] <zakelfassi>   var matches = class.match (YOUR_REGEX) || [];
[12:15:14] <zakelfassi>   return (matches.join (' '));
[12:15:15] <zakelfassi> });
[12:15:18] <Zzaichik> element[class^="beginning"]
[12:15:24] <Zzaichik> ^^ CSS
[12:15:36] <EweR> how to toggle all rows and checkboxes in the table? http://jsfiddle.net/FHjAc/5/
[12:15:49] <EweR> using the selectall button
[12:16:06] <zakelfassi> Zzaichik: Yeah that'd work; but he wants to remove classes.
[12:16:48] <gnarf> wgolden: use JavaScript/DOM??? element.className = element.className.replace( /\bprefix-\S+/g, "" );
[12:17:26] <josePHPagoda> zakelfassi: so my head has http://hastebin.com/waroveculi.xml
[12:17:29] <josePHPagoda> is that not valid?
[12:17:57] <josePHPagoda> or are you recommending that I move the <script>..</script> to the bottom?
[12:18:13] <gnarf> script in head is bad practice
[12:18:16] <zakelfassi> josePHPagoda: I prefer that you put all the scripts [same order] before you </body> -- and try ;)
[12:18:19] <gnarf> script at bottom is better
[12:18:45] <zakelfassi> josePHPagoda: as gnarf said, bad practice by all means - page loading, DOM parsing, ...
[12:19:16] <josePHPagoda> so <script> should be after my </body> but before the </html> right?
[12:19:47] <gnarf> semantically, script should be inside <body></body> -- best practice is to place them all at the end
[12:20:12] <gnarf> well - best practice is to only use one <script></script> but that rarely is seen
[12:20:24] <Zzaichik> ^^
[12:20:25] <josePHPagoda> that's what I'm doing right now
[12:20:31] <josePHPagoda> what puzzles me is that the tabs work
[12:20:35] <josePHPagoda> they just don't get styled properly
[12:20:46] <gnarf> do you have a theme included?
[12:21:04] <josePHPagoda> yes, that's the first line in my hastebin
[12:21:19] <josePHPagoda> which is just the humanity theme
[12:21:26] <josePHPagoda> from the jqueryui site
[12:21:32] <Zzaichik> jquery ui also has their own styles, are you sure your custom css isn't being pooped on?
[12:21:49] <racquad> hi there. I have a huge simple problem to solve.
[12:21:52] <racquad> http://pastebin.com/J2wqKsqH
[12:22:21] <seich> racquad: what's the problem?
[12:22:35] <racquad> the thing is: when I select the id_uf_residencial, I want to change the value of id_cidade_residencial. but I want to do it with classes. How can I select the next .id_cidade element?
[12:22:58] <racquad> seich, that's the problem. Have I made myself clear?
[12:23:35] <zakelfassi> EweR: Working on that â€¦ just a sec
[12:23:36] <josePHPagoda> this is working in the example file Zzaichik
[12:23:46] <EweR> zakelfassi, ty :)
[12:24:30] <seich> racquad: if you have the previous one selected in a jquery object you can just use .next()
[12:24:40] <josePHPagoda> the only diff is that i'm running it from inside of the assets/ folder
[12:24:54] <Seich> racquad: but I might not be entirely getting the problem...
[12:26:10] <racquad> seich, look at this simple function I made. It's not working: http://pastebin.com/KT0WQjRp
[12:29:33] <Zzaichik> I don't think you're using .change properly.
[12:32:14] <racquad> Seich, Zzaichik, look at this simple test: http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/2/
[12:32:39] <racquad> if I change the first dropdown it should change the second background. But it doesn't
[12:32:52] <garciawebdev> hey, how can I change jQuery UI Datepicker displayed month without changing current date? (As if changed by cliking on the arrows)
[12:34:27] <zakelfassi> EweR: http://jsfiddle.net/FHjAc/6/ here you go - I'm sure there's a lot to add/refactor; but you get the picture.
[12:35:03] <Zzaichik> racquad: ahh  .next doesn't look down through children elements
[12:35:07] <Zzaichik> it looks to siblings
[12:35:25] <racquad> Zzaichik: dammit! :)
[12:35:49] <racquad> Zzaichik: even with siblings: http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/3/
[12:35:55] <EweR> zakelfassi, I appreciate that, thank you!
[12:36:13] <zakelfassi> EweR: Sorry â€¦ one last version http://jsfiddle.net/FHjAc/7/
[12:36:27] <zakelfassi> EweR: Was debugging and I forgot some stuff / broken rows.
[12:36:42] <EweR> zakelfassi, thank you tons, u saved my life
[12:36:54] <zakelfassi> EweR: you're welcome ;)
[12:37:14] <racquad> Zzaichik: so, how can I solve this?
[12:37:36] <racquad> I want to look for the next closest element, wherever it is...
[12:39:12] <Zzaichik> racquad: let me think for a second
[12:39:42] <Seich> racquad: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/5/
[12:40:18] <Seich> since they have different containers you'd have to go out and look on the parent's siblings
[12:41:11] <racquad> Seich: sort of, but I would like to keep it in a more generic way. I don't know if the class "span4" is going to be 4 forever.. I might change it to span5 or span3 and don't want to mind about the JS function...
[12:41:50] <Seich> use div then
[12:42:07] <Seich> since the container is the first div you can find going upwards
[12:42:16] <Seich> http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/6/
[12:43:17] <racquad> Seich: that's it!
[12:43:35] <gnarf> Seich: parents() is wrong there
[12:43:45] <gnarf> Seich: use ?closest
[12:43:45] <bot-t> Seich, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:43:52] <gnarf> cc racquad ^^^
[12:44:07] <Zzaichik> racquad: oh yep - that's pretty close to what I had  http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/8/
[12:44:12] <josePHPagoda> figured out my problem
[12:44:15] <gnarf> .closest( "div" ) will only ever return one or zero, where parents( "div" ) can be more than one
[12:44:25] <racquad> ok, folks. now, there's more. http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/7/
[12:44:26] <josePHPagoda> apparently, it's important to have rel="stylesheet"
[12:44:37] <jrodl3r> apparently
[12:44:40] <racquad> As I said, I want the closest dropdown, not all...
[12:44:41] <josePHPagoda> :P
[12:45:49] <Seich> racquad: yeah, just use closest
[12:45:52] <Zzaichik> racquad: did you see my thing?
[12:46:03] <Zzaichik> ^ http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/8/
[12:46:14] <gnarf> racquad: is it always in the same .row-fluid ?
[12:46:30] <racquad> Zzaichik: sorry, I missed. I'm going to look
[12:46:40] <Seich> http://jsfiddle.net/b9MuL/9/
[12:46:47] <gnarf> racquad: i would suggest $( this ).closest( ".row-fluid" ).find( ".id_cidade" )
[12:46:48] <racquad> gnarf: Yes, maybe the class name can change a little
[12:47:06] <gnarf> racquad: look up for the closest .row-fluid, then look inside that for the id
[12:47:11] <Zzaichik> that's a good idea.
[12:47:35] <gnarf> racquad: use some class name that might not change, its a container class you'll be attaching behavior to
[12:48:14] <gnarf> like
[12:48:26] <gnarf> <div class="select-widget row-fluid">....
[12:48:30] <gnarf> and use .select-widget
[12:49:00] <gnarf> traversing is easiest if you have sane class names
[12:49:14] <racquad> gnarf: that's a good idea
[12:49:48] <racquad> Zzaichik: i'll try to put your code under my app and see what happens. anyway that was a kind tricky question.
[12:49:53] <racquad> thanks a lot, guys
[12:50:09] <Seich> no problem ;O
[12:50:29] <gnarf> if you depend on things like .next() and .prev() it can solve a problem, but it will often create more if you ever redesign the html... using classes is just easier
[12:51:08] <Zzaichik> racquad: your welcome.
[12:57:51] <Aero`> Hi guys :) ! I've got a little problem with WYSIHTML5. I used it on a textarea but now I want to set a value with jquery on it. .val() doesn't work
[12:58:01] <Aero`> any ideas ?
[12:59:16] <Awan> jquery

[13:04:37] <machty> hey all, i've google extensively but figured i'd give the jquery IRC a shot: is there a jquery plugin that does an arbitrarily sized (and therefore capable of fullscreen) image slideshow in the style of the Mac OS X screensaver slideshow, which does light zooming / pan effects before switching to the next image?
[13:05:11] <astropirate> macabre, i'm sure there are many, i don't know the though
[13:07:02] <Aero`> @Zzaichik : i want to put html in the wysihtml5 editor :(
[13:07:13] <Aero`> i find javascript code
[13:07:26] <Aero`> but to be honest I don't really know how to run it with jquery selectors
[13:08:14] <Aero`> 	$("#editcontenu").wysihtml5().data("wysihtml5").editor.setValue("test");
[13:08:17] <Aero`> this works
[13:08:25] <Aero`> but I'd like to put HTML
[13:08:34] <Aero`> (this html comes from a getJSON request)
[13:09:21] <Aero`> I found this : editorInstance.composer.commands.exec("insertHTML", "<blockquote>foobar</blockquote>");
[13:09:29] <Aero`> but this is javascript and I don't know how to adapt it
[13:09:32] <Aero`> to jquery code
[13:09:48] <Aero`> any guess ?
[13:09:53] <therealklanni> Is there a way to get a list of all of the instances of a jqUI widget?
[13:10:28] <Zzaichik> Aero`:  .html(); I think
[13:10:35] <astropirate> therealklanni, it adds a class, so yes, just search for th class
[13:11:44] <therealklanni> astropirate: not for Widget Factory widgets
[13:12:25] <Aero`> @Zzaichik : No luck with .html()
[13:12:25] <astropirate> therealklanni, i'm not sure then
[13:12:37] <therealklanni> But more to the point, jqUI must have a handle on all of the widgets that have been instantiated already, so I'd rather access it that way
[13:12:41] <astropirate> therealklanni, though, as far as i've seen pretty much all widgets add a cass
[13:12:54] <Zzaichik> Aero`: Let me get this straight. You want to show the actual html inside the textarea?
[13:13:25] <Zzaichik> Aero`:  this doesn't work /isn't right?  http://jsfiddle.net/J9gca/
[13:17:13] <faraway> Aero`: what do you mean with  you want to put html ?
[13:17:36] <Zzaichik> Yeah - I thought I understood...
[13:17:54] <Zzaichik> I think I'm wrong though
[13:18:58] <Aero`> No you were right !
[13:19:03] <Aero`> I have a textarea
[13:19:17] <Aero`> I turn it into a wysihtml5 through jquery
[13:19:26] <Aero`> then, I have a getJSON script
[13:19:38] <Aero`> and I want to set a value inside the wysihtml5
[13:19:49] <Aero`> It's a news system
[13:19:53] <Aero`> to edit a news
[13:20:01] <Aero`> I get the html content from a mySQL database
[13:20:05] <Aero`> through getJson
[13:20:14] <Aero`> and I want the html content to appear in the editor
[13:21:01] <Aero`> about what you posted on JSfiddle, I assume it would work but it would put this html only on the textarea
[13:21:18] <Aero`> but the textarea is hidden and replaced by an iframe by wysihtml5()
[13:21:46] <faraway> Aero`: why do you want to display the html code in the editor ?
[13:21:55] <Aero`> I don't want to display the code
[13:22:00] <Aero`> I want the code to be interpreted
[13:22:14] <Aero`> that way <b>Hello world</b> would appear bold in the editor
[13:22:17] <faraway> Aero`: that is what setValue does ?
[13:22:21] <derekpioneer> i've got this liveperson code that fetches an external script and then appends an image to my page
[13:22:35] <derekpioneer> seems like putting a selector for that image inside domready doesn't find it
[13:22:39] <derekpioneer> like it's not loaded yet or something
[13:22:55] <derekpioneer> how do i bind to an image load that is not there when the page is loaded initially?
[13:23:07] <Aero`> @faraway : It works perfectly with $("#editcontenu").wysihtml5().data("wysihtml5").editor.setValue("<b>test</b>");
[13:23:25] <Aero`> but my problem is that
[13:23:35] <astropirate> derekpioneer, $('my image').on('load', function() {})
[13:23:51] <Aero`> I have an .ajax() request on a controller page, and this returns a JSON with the news id, the title, and the html content
[13:24:21] <Aero`> but if I put $("#editcontenu").wysihtml5().data("wysihtml5").editor.setValue(MYVARIABLENAME); in the success case of $.ajax(); it doesn't work
[13:24:42] <raj> i have a crazy idea
[13:24:56] <Aero`> If it was a simple textarea, $("input[name=editcontenu]").val(data.contenu); would work perfectly
[13:25:10] <Aero`> I want to do the same, but with my wysihtml5 editor instead of the textarea
[13:25:44] <faraway> Aero`: are you really sure that MYVARIABLENAME  is string ?
[13:26:13] <raj> is there something wrong with programmatically loading a js file?
[13:26:23] <jrodl3r> no
[13:26:28] <jrodl3r> but only if you mean well
[13:26:34] <Aero`> @faraway : yeah, it would behave correctly with .val() if it wasn't
[13:26:52] <raj> lol
[13:27:39] <raj> then why is there no way to unload a js file?
[13:27:59] <raj> also, would it be riduclous to always check window.location before running each function?
[13:28:24] <Aero`> $.ajax({
[13:28:24] <Aero`> 					type:"GET",
[13:28:24] <Aero`> 					data: dataString,
[13:28:24] <Aero`> 					url:"news_ajax.php?action=read",
[13:28:24] <Aero`> 					dataType: "json",
[13:28:25] <Aero`> 					beforeSend: function(x) {
[13:28:25] <Aero`>     			    if(x && x.overrideMimeType) {
[13:28:26] <Aero`>                     x.overrideMimeType("application/j-son;charset=UTF-8"); } },
[13:28:26] <Aero`> 					success: function(data){
[13:28:27] <Aero`> 						$("input[name=editid]").val(data.id);
[13:28:27] <Aero`> 						$("input[name=editdate]").val(data.date);
[13:28:28] <Aero`> 						$("input[name=edittitre]").val(data.titre);
[13:28:28] <Aero`> 						$("#editcontenu").wysihtml5().data("wysihtml5").editor.setValue(data.contenu);
[13:28:29] <Aero`> 						},
[13:28:31] <juha_> dude
[13:28:33] <juha_> wtf
[13:28:35] <juha_> jsfiddle
[13:28:41] <Aero`> I don't have an account :(
[13:28:47] <Aero`> sorry
[13:28:47] <Aero`> lol
[13:28:48] <juha_> wut
[13:28:49] <b-ot> Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[13:29:01] <juha_> b-ot: true dat
[13:29:14] <juha_> Aero`: you dont need account for jsfiddle
[13:29:22] <jrodl3r> lol
[13:29:58] <Aero`> oh, sorry
[13:30:02] <Aero`> so newb ><
[13:30:03] <Aero`> http://jsfiddle.net/WdWnk/
[13:31:34] <Aero`> @faraway : hope do you see the problem better now
[13:32:05] <defaultro_> hey folks, what does this code mean? var tmp = $(stepsHtml);
[13:32:24] <delinquentme> $('#refined_biomes').find('td')[1]   im getting a value here
[13:32:40] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: It depends on what stepsHtml is.
[13:32:57] <defaultro_> stepHtml are HTML tags
[13:33:03] <faraway> Aero`: if you change the script like this http://jsfiddle.net/WdWnk/1/  is the editor updated to "test" and the other thing is pleas show the output of the console.dir for data (but not here, use jsfiddle and add it to the comment and the du "Update")
[13:33:11] <delinquentme> and I want to set it with $('#refined_biomes').find('td')[1].html = 'blah';
[13:33:15] <delinquentme> is this correct?
[13:33:20] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: Then it's creating a temporary element to work with.
[13:33:39] <defaultro_> BillCriswell: the populated tmp is huge. It's [  .... ]
[13:34:06] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: An array?
[13:34:14] <BillCriswell> Or is it just a monster string?
[13:34:25] <defaultro_> looks like an array but it's big and different properties like an object
[13:34:52] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: Hard to work in the dark like this haha. What are you trying to do with it?
[13:34:56] <defaultro_> it says object
[13:35:01] <defaultro_> i ran typeof tmp
[13:35:27] <defaultro_> so that jquery line maybe made it as an object
[13:37:01] <cambazz> hello, when i do changes in domtree, i set a variable in a hidden form to true, so when document ready comes, i can check if it is true, and if so reload the page
[13:37:05] <cambazz> this works for firefox
[13:37:15] <cambazz> but i noticed it wont work for chrome
[13:37:25] <cambazz> chrome wont remember the hidden value
[13:37:30] <scotdb> Has anyone been able to use the validate plugin with a multi-row entry form, with second and subsequent rows added with clone() : I can't get it to validate anything but the first (original) row.
[13:37:36] <jrodl3r> â€¦.html('blah');
[13:38:19] <Aero`> @faraway : see PM !
[13:38:42] <delinquentme> ok so im in chromes console and running this... $('#refined_biomes').find('#uno').text = "Boreal Forest";
[13:38:52] <delinquentme> and its giving me back "Boreal Forest" ... but not actually updating the HTML
[13:38:54] <delinquentme> why?
[13:39:15] <Haprog> text('...') maybe?
[13:39:39] <Haprog> it's a method, not an attribute.
[13:39:51] <Haprog> *not a property
[13:39:51] <delinquentme> Haprog, .text = text('....')  ?
[13:39:54] <Haprog> no
[13:39:57] <Haprog> .text()
[13:40:04] <delinquentme> nailed it
[13:41:16] <PoG> anyone had experience with Masonry JS and resizing on the fly ie, a drop down menu or summat INSIDE one of the mason'd boxes?
[13:41:28] <Aero`> @faraway : see PM !
[13:48:18] <Aero`> @faraway : you see the problem ?
[13:48:55] <faraway> Aero`: well form the first look it does not have something to do with you request
[13:49:02] <faraway> from
[13:50:52] <Aero`> yeah but its strange because the post request is handled normally
[13:51:09] <Aero`> but if I add
[13:51:09] <Aero`> 			$("#editcontenu").wysihtml5().data("wysihtml5").editor.setValue("<b>test</b>");
[13:51:09] <Aero`> 			
[13:51:11] <faraway> Aero`: as i said thats not the problem
[13:51:16] <Aero`> even somewhere else in the code
[13:51:20] <Aero`> the request goes fubar
[13:51:41] <fission6> got a lazy loader for images recommendation?
[13:51:53] <faraway> Aero`: i don't really use jquery ui so this is just i guess .. i think .modal is cloning the element for displaying
[13:53:02] <Aero`> neither do I lol :) there's no jquery ui code there
[13:53:12] <faraway> Aero`: and because of that there are then two elements with the id "editcontenu" in you dom node $("#editcontenu") finds the first one ... but this is not the one that is displayed
[13:53:34] <Aero`> mmh I'll take a look at that
[13:54:04] <faraway> Aero`: where does . modal() come from ?
[13:54:05] <Aero`> well it looks ok
[13:54:15] <Aero`> the modal comes from Twitter Bootstrap
[13:54:27] <Aero`> and the modal is is "editactu"
[13:54:34] <Aero`> where the textarea id is "editcontenu"
[13:55:17] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: What are you trying to do to it, though?
[13:55:50] <defaultro_> BillCriswell: just figuring out why the code was written like that
[13:56:00] <defaultro_> it's my firstime seeing that kind of syntax
[13:58:07] <freeed> Hey guys.. I have a bunch of pair elements on my page (<div class="bar"> and <div class="foo">) how can I select the next immediate .foo sibling if I've selected a .bar? .siblings() grabs all of them on the page, and .closest() only looks up in the dom :\ Any ideas? Thanks!
[13:58:54] <raj> why is live/die deprecated?
[13:59:04] <raj> in favor of on/off?
[13:59:12] <freeed> nvm.. haha. .next() is too easy :D
[13:59:16] <raj> they provide a different, but useful, functionality
[13:59:37] <alchimis_> hi every one
[14:00:27] <alchimis_> I am using twitter bootsrap tab, generating the li content with php
[14:00:46] <Aero`> @faraway : you understand better now ?
[14:00:49] <alchimis_> the issue that i have is that the first li should have the class active
[14:01:19] <faraway> Aero`: still my guess is that ".modal" is "killing" your code .. but i can't tell you how to solve it
[14:01:30] <alchimis_> but none of this works for me https://gist.github.com/01be86ef52b896c014ef
[14:02:19] <Aero`> @faraway : .modal doesnt act on the same object :s do you think it could break up everything though ?
[14:02:37] <Aero`> .modal acts on a div which id is "editactu"
[14:02:46] <raj> I wanna do something crazy, so far fetched, i don't even know where to begin
[14:03:00] <alchimis_> please, some one wanna help me in this regard?
[14:03:23] <raj> I want to find every event listener created in a .js file and unbind() them
[14:03:51] <raj> by running `release(myjsfile.js)`
[14:04:54] <Zzaichik> "I release you.."
[14:05:03] <raj> exactly
[14:05:27] <raj> shoky, you around?
[14:05:28] <faraway> Aero`: i know that it does not work on the same element, but the editor is a child of that element (more exactly an iframe, with content editable turned on) and moving editors around in the dom, e.g. wrapping an element around to display a modal, does not work well most of the time.
[14:06:18] <Aero`> mmh ok I see
[14:06:23] <Aero`> thanks for the help :)
[14:06:33] <Aero`> thanks for the explanation ;)
[14:06:44] <Aero`> I'll try to give it a try outside the modal later.
[14:06:45] <Aero`> thanks ;)
[14:06:55] <Aero`> cya !

[15:00:20] <DimmuR> Hello everyone. I have some select that is updated through javascript (autocomplete) but i need to do some action when option is selected - is there an way to detect that select was changed? .change, .keyup .focus and such doesn't work since user is not clicking there
[15:05:11] <JessC> @DimmuR can you have that as part of your ajax script that updates that select input?
[15:06:07] <DimmuR> JessC, it's 3rd party lib so i'ts quite hard that's why i was thinking about reaction for form changes
[15:06:21] <DimmuR> i'm doing research now if it's possible to make it simplier
[15:06:53] <JessC> what is the lib?

[15:22:28] <species> im trying to make a dialog using a form tag, with the id "frmStartServer" but when I select it, i get a type error "object has no method dialog"
[15:23:04] <species> is the dialog a plugin that I need to install?
[15:23:11] <rmill> jQuery UI
[15:23:25] <species> thats a seperate plugin?

[15:26:15] <coachz> but it's like they are loading something else that I'm missing
[15:28:33] <species> well great, jquery UI has no installation instructions
[15:28:49] <species> i assume its just a case of dropping its files to the right places?
[15:28:52] <coachz> you just include it
[15:29:31] <species> the files will need to be in the right place first
[15:29:46] <coachz> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/yourpath/jquery-ui.css" />
[15:30:02] <coachz> <script src="/yourpath/jquery-ui-1.8.1.js"></script>
[15:30:03] <coachz> that' sit
[15:30:21] <species> oh, i was worried by this "development bundle" which seems to require compilation |:
[15:30:23] <coachz> typically the css file goes in /css and the js in  /js
[15:30:31] <coachz> no it's super easy
[15:30:39] <coachz> two files
[15:31:01] <coachz> and when you are bored you can got to jquery theme roller and make your own colorful themes
[15:31:54] <juanlas> so there is some mention of CORS in the docs, but does anyone know if or how CORS is supported?

[15:49:41] <redsand> anyone have issues with using jquery tabs + draggable portlets, when switching from 1 tab to another, div layer portlet-content doesn't draw
[15:49:46] <redsand> maybe a browser bug?
[15:50:02] <redsand> ie has no problem, but ff fails
[16:07:28] <TehShrike|Work> So guys, I've got these crazy shenanigans going on.
[16:08:42] <TehShrike|Work> I'm making an ajax request, and at some point immediately after jQuery.ajaxTransport.send.callback finishes running, something in jQuery causes the current page to redirect to mysite.com/[object%20Object]
[16:09:58] <ajpiano> TehShrike|Work: got a live demo of it failing? are you using a custom transport?
[16:11:05] <TehShrike|Work> I don't have a live demo, I'm very sorry, and this is only happening in certain places in my app that I can't build a good test case for.  I feel really bad because this is such a shitty bug report, I'm mostly fishing to see if somebody just happens to magically know what might be causing this.
[16:11:27] <TehShrike|Work> What's a custom transport?  I'm not using one as far as I know.
[16:11:35] <ajpiano> you'd know if you were using one
[16:11:40] <ajpiano> ?ajaxTransport
[16:11:42] <bot-t> ajpiano, Extending Ajax: Prefilters, Converters, and Transports - As of jQuery 1.5, $.ajax() provides three means to extend its functionalities for sending, receiving, and managing ajax requests: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[16:12:05] <lizardbrain> how would i convert an array to json? $.ajax({url: 'a.php?json&update=' + data,
[16:12:09] <ajpiano> don't think you're gonna catch much fish with that query unfortunately
[16:12:15] <ajpiano> ?stringify @ lizardbrain
[16:12:15] <bot-t> lizardbrain, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[16:12:15] <lizardbrain> data needs to be json string
[16:12:57] <lizardbrain> jquery can not send an array over ajax?!
[16:13:13] <ajpiano> no, that's not what that says
[16:13:19] <ajpiano> it says that it doesn't have a built in JSON stringifier
[16:13:59] <lizardbrain> ok i must be setting up this ajax wrong
[16:14:08] <lizardbrain> how do i pass an array to the ajax reqest
[16:15:00] <ajpiano> it depends what your backend is expecting
[16:15:05] <TehShrike|Work> lizardbrain: easiest way would probably be to throw it into an object - { myArray: lolArray }
[16:16:15] <ajpiano> but the array won't be sent properly because it won't be able to serialize an array into a query string
[16:16:37] <lizardbrain> TehShrike|Work: like $.ajax({url: 'a.php?json&update', data: {myArray: lolArray}, ...
[16:16:38] <ajpiano> lizardbrain: the dead-simplest way to send an array of simple values (strings, numbers, booleans) over ajax is just to .join() it
[16:17:04] <lizardbrain> the array is of {objects}
[16:17:13] <ajpiano> yeah then you'll want to use JSON.stringify
[16:17:24] <TehShrike|Work> Yup.
[16:17:26] <lizardbrain> and im writing the backend so it will expect whatever i send it
[16:17:35] <TehShrike|Work> PHP?
[16:17:47] <ajpiano> $.ajax({ data: {everything: JSON.stringify(dataStruct) } });
[16:18:13] <TehShrike|Work> and json_decode on the server side, assuming you're using PHP
[16:18:29] <TehShrike|Work> And JSON.parse if you're using node.js :-)

[16:40:26] <recurse> but it doesnt seem to do shit
[16:40:38] <recurse> sorry for the highlight
[16:41:51] <ringo> you cannot access a parent document from within an iframe
[16:42:09] <recurse> they are on same domain, why not?
[16:42:10] <ringo> that's a security measure
[16:42:23] <ringo> you can't using iframe
[16:42:24] <recurse> you sure from same domain its security measure?
[16:42:32] <ringo> you should only use an iframe if you really need to
[16:42:44] <ringo> if they're the same domain, you shouldn't need an iframe, most likely
[16:42:45] <recurse> well, married to the iframe unfortunatly,
[16:42:56] <recurse> but ....
[16:43:16] <recurse> theres gatta be a way ive tried some recommendations on google, to no avail though

[16:45:53] <recurse> therealklanni, put that code after your div declaration or element with the id's
[16:46:10] <recurse> and make sure your document.ready'ing
[16:46:55] <recurse> ringo, ya shriveled 900 year old reptilian rock star ...
[16:46:56] <therealklanni> That's not my problem. I would get "you can't execute a method before initializing" error from jquery UI
[16:47:01] <ringo> yeah, looks like that stackoverflow code would return the html in the parent
[16:47:15] <ringo> oh, thank you
[16:47:22] <mrryanjohnston> recurse: I read that you should be able to access the parent doc from within the iframe if you set the cookie domains to be the same on both iframe and parent
[16:47:29] <recurse> j/k ringo
[16:47:51] <ringo> i don't know if it returns the html as text or as a jquery object
[16:47:59] <ringo> seems to suggest the latter
[16:48:43] <therealklanni> recurse: in short my widget is long since initialized and DOM is long since "ready", but thanks for trying
[16:49:14] <ringo> recurse, i'd try putting a longish setTimeout() around the iframe's code to make sure the iframe and parent are both loaded fully
[16:49:49] <recurse> 	if($('#theBar img',window.parent.document).html().hasClass('active')) {
[16:49:57] <recurse> meh ... didnt work
[16:50:36] <recurse> why would it with incorrect cyntax
[16:51:15] <ringo> what is html().hasClass()
[16:51:31] <recurse> yes ... my new special fuction
[16:51:38] <ringo> haha
[16:51:40] <recurse> part of the break your page library
[16:51:50] <ringo> put it on github
[16:51:55] <recurse> yes
[16:52:06] <recurse> like suicideLinux
[16:52:09] <ringo> you'll get so many followers
[16:54:42] <ringo> ha
[16:56:22] <recurse> 				var thediv = $(window.parent.document).find("#theBar").html();
[16:56:23] <recurse> 				if($('#theBar img', thediv).hasClass('active')) {
[16:56:39] <recurse> im not sure what i missed there, but it doesnt seem to work, yet no errors...
[16:57:15] <recurse> the #theBar is a div and img is nested within this div. the img has the class active
[16:57:25] <recurse> and this is on the parent frame
[16:57:52] <ringo> can you do a find() on the document?
[16:58:07] <ringo> shouldn't it be like $('body').find()
[16:58:36] <recurse> that would dig the current page and the parent ?
[16:58:43] <recurse> and not the parent*
[16:59:33] <ringo> $('body', window.parent.document)     ?
[17:00:06] <recurse> perhaps, let me try
[17:00:27] <ringo> $('#theBar img', window.parent.document)
[17:01:47] <JessC> you could do window.parent.$();
[17:02:44] <recurse> JessC, please elaborate?
[17:02:48] <recurse> ringo, no dice
[17:08:10] <raj> instead of having to program in callbacks for async stuff, is there something that'll handle that ugliness for me and allow me to put it in the order of function calls?
[17:08:20] <therealklanni> Ah, I see my problem :) derp
[17:09:07] <recurse> 	var thediv = jQuery('body', window.parent.document).find("#theBar").html(); - this works if i alert(thediv);
[17:09:21] <recurse> so i suspect this is wrong? 	if(jQuery('.collapsePanel', thediv).hasClass('active')) {
[17:10:19] <haizum> anyone know how to calculate the value of width, with only having the value of height, with an aspect ratio of 16:9 ?
[17:15:04] <JessC> @recurse if the parent has jquery then you can reference it by doing window.parent.$()
[17:15:33] <cwdoh> haizum: you mean caculate width from height with 16:9 ratio? parseInt( ( height * 16 ) / 9 )
[17:15:44] <recurse> i can get the div from the parent into thediv JessC
[17:15:55] <recurse> my condition seems wrong
[17:16:07] <recurse> if($('.collapsePanel', thediv).hasClass('active')) {
[17:16:19] <recurse> doesnt seem to see the contents of thediv
[17:16:32] <recurse> yet thediv is infact populate
[17:16:42] <recurse> alert(thediv) works
[17:17:45] <JessC> what does the div look like?
[17:18:23] <recurse> <img class="collapsePanel" src="images/pixel_trans.gif" alt="Collapse Panel" border="0" height="117" width="5">
[17:19:39] <mrs1ck> Howdy all. Looking for something to do in jQuery for a beginner - intermediate level programmer. Bonues points if you can suggest something for jQuery Mobile. Any ideas?
[17:19:41] <recurse> and active is applied to the class once i actually click it
[17:19:48] <haizum> cwdoh: why the parseint?
[17:19:55] <gataraid> Hi everyone, I'm trying to add an icon/image to the parent if it has children and it seems to actually add these values to everything instead
[17:20:01] <gataraid> not sure what I am doing wrong at the moment
[17:20:02] <recurse> such as <img class="collapsePanel active"
[17:20:06] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/9BCJ4ySn
[17:20:16] <recurse> JessC ^
[17:21:14] <gataraid> oh wait a second wrong one
[17:21:16] <gataraid> I'm so sorry
[17:21:31] <JessC> @recurse if you have a jsfiddle of this that'd help. At first glance though I think its not matching because its looking for children inside of collapsePanel
[17:21:46] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/XfVEuRR4
[17:23:20] <MistuhKurtz> when using event delegation, is it best to use $(e.currentTarget) when you would normally use $(this) to refer to the element the event is bound to?
[17:24:35] <phonebook_> is there a way to add properties to Object while using jQuery? This very simple function causes the program to crash http://pastebin.com/a4JFp7KK
[17:24:40] <ringo> recurse, did you figure it out
[17:24:55] <recurse> no im trying different conditons
[17:25:01] <recurse> but i can access the parent
[17:25:15] <recurse> find() and html() seem to work .. .rather clunky, but will get the job don i think
[17:25:16] <ringo> oh cool
[17:25:25] <ringo> what's the issue then
[17:25:37] <recurse> my condition dosnt seem to be correct
[17:25:40] <cwdoh> haizum: oops, it's just a my habit, converting integer. :)
[17:25:41] <JessC> @MistuhKurtz when you create the event inside your function this will always refer to the current target
[17:25:52] <recurse> like JessC suggested, i think im trying to access children of the returned element
[17:26:33] <MistuhKurtz> JessC, in the case of: $('#wrapper').on('click', 'a', function(){ /* ... */ }); this will refer to #wrapper
[17:27:20] <MistuhKurtz> phonebook_, you shouldn't do that. here's why: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/03/02/maintainable-javascript-dont-modify-objects-you-down-own/
[17:27:57] <gataraid> Would someone mind helping me a moment?
[17:28:00] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/XfVEuRR4
[17:28:04] <phonebook_> fair point
[17:28:09] <phonebook_> but...jquery does it
[17:28:39] <recurse> if($('#maintab', thediv).css('width') == "0px") {
[17:28:41] <defaultro> hey guys, cursor = "wait" works. However, cursor: url(some.png) doesn't work
[17:28:47] <recurse> thediv ... do i still access it like that ?
[17:29:15] <JessC> @MistuhKurtz in the case you pointed out you would use the event.currentTarget. But it looks like you are grabbing it by and id and attaching an event to all its chidren (a href tags) you can do something like $('#id').children('a').on('event', function() {}); and then this will refer to the correct object
[17:29:15] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE grabbing it by and id and attaching an event to all its chidren (a href tags) you can do something like $('#id').children('a').on('event', function() {}); and then this will refer to the correct object
[17:29:40] <MistuhKurtz> phonebook_, where does jquery do it?
[17:29:56] <phonebook_> ill just do it as a utility. but would still like to know why even touching Object.prototype causes jquery to freak out
[17:30:09] <MistuhKurtz> I was reading a couple blog posts on the subject on Friday and one of them was explaining how the Prototype library got in a giant mess because they attempted to do that
[17:30:15] <MistuhKurtz> sorry that's the only blog post I can find atm
[17:30:46] <recurse> JessC, 	if($('#maintab', thediv).css('width') == "0px") {   would i access the contents returned by the var i assigned, as shown? (thediv?)
[17:30:53] <MistuhKurtz> JessC, thanks for the clarification, I was just curious about when delegation is a necessity
[17:31:05] <MistuhKurtz> what to do when delegation is a necessity*
[17:31:43] <JessC> @MistuhKurtz delegation is just an alias for the "on" function in the latest version of jquery
[17:32:01] <phonebook_> yeah no biggy... moving on
[17:32:12] <JessC> if i'm not mistaken internally delegation uses on
[17:32:20] <shoky> delegation is done by on
[17:32:26] <shoky> depending on how on is called
[17:32:30] <MistuhKurtz> I am speaking of delegation as a  concept, not the jquery api method
[17:32:36] <MistuhKurtz> on() can use event delegation or normal event binding.
[17:32:50] <JessC> you would use it when you have elements that do not exist when the page is first rendered
[17:33:01] <MistuhKurtz> yep.
[17:33:09] <shoky> MistuhKurtz, it's perfectly fine to refer to e.currentTarget if you want the element where teh event was bound
[17:33:11] <shoky> afaik
[17:33:33] <shoky> you would also use it for performance
[17:33:55] <JessC> yes what @shoky said also how much you feel like writing that's usually my determining factor ;)
[17:34:11] <shoky> sometimes it's a must
[17:34:18] <gataraid> nevermind, I'll figure it out
[17:34:20] <gataraid> THanks anyway
[17:34:23] <JessC> @gataraid I looked at your code
[17:34:39] <gataraid> Hi JessC :)
[17:34:41] <JessC> you are applying that css to all the children inside the object you are looking at
[17:35:04] <gataraid> I think I pasted the wrong one again :s
[17:35:21] <recurse> any insight on my condition guys?
[17:35:57] <recurse> 		var thediv = jQuery('body', window.parent.document).find("#thePanel").html();  if(jQuery('#maintab', thediv).css('width') == "0px") {
[17:36:10] <gataraid> if (jQuery("#sidebar ul ul.wpsc_top_level_categories ul.wpsc_second_level_categories").children().length > 0) - does this not check if it has children ?
[17:36:52] <gataraid> I'm trying to check if ul.wpsc_second_level_categories has any elements inside it, then to add some css conditions
[17:37:27] <shoky> it does.. assuming that selector is correct
[17:37:37] <recurse> my question is, since thediv returns true with content, how to access it ?
[17:37:47] <recurse> 	if($('#maintab', thediv).css('width') == "0px") {
[17:37:57] <recurse> that doesnt seem to see it
[17:38:30] <gataraid> for some reason it adds it to every element though
[17:39:05] <gataraid> well, adds my condition - sorry
[17:39:46] <gataraid> whoops
[17:42:42] <andrew_mcc> I've got a draggable question, when I drag an item from one list to another, that item's select boxes don't work with jquer .changed() any more
[17:44:30] <andrew_mcc> and neither do other event handelers in the dragged element
[17:46:31] <recurse> ok
[17:46:33] <recurse> 	if(jQuery(thediv + '#maintab').css('width') == "0px") {	
[17:46:38] <recurse> that works
[17:46:42] <recurse> ringo ^
[17:46:48] <ringo> wha
[17:46:57] <recurse> var thediv = jQuery('body', window.parent.document).find("#thePanel").html();
[17:48:15] <ringo> so #mainTab is a child of #thePanel ?
[17:48:32] <recurse> yes
[17:48:39] <gataraid> if (jQuery("#sidebar ul ul.wpsc_top_level_categories ul.wpsc_second_level_categories").has("li"))
[17:48:41] <gataraid> would this work too?
[17:48:49] <ringo> don't you need a space like this ' #maintab"
[17:49:00] <ringo> er, ' #maintab'
[17:49:10] <gataraid> selects them all again :s
[17:49:36] <recurse> why would i need a space?
[17:49:56] <recurse> thediv doesnt return a classname
[17:50:14] <recurse> it returns a block of content
[17:50:47] <recurse> but the doesnt work unless you refresh the iframe ... meh ...
[17:50:53] <recurse> what use is that
[17:51:11] <tw2113> grooooosssss iframes
[17:51:17] <recurse> maybe i did it backwards and i should be targetting the content inside the iframe oppsed to trying to detect an active class on the parent
[17:52:22] <ringo> interesting
[17:52:29] <ringo> yeah, i guess you could go either way
[17:54:16] <relipse> hey anyone who tried out my time tracker invoicer at cworklog.com in the previous week, check it out one more time, it got a site redesign and I need some input please :)
[17:54:46] <recurse> yea thats the way i gatta do it ... but this bit i just did would be good for a fallback in case they refresh the iframe
[18:01:14] <andrew_mcc> when I drag an element from one list to another, it's event handlers don't work anymore, any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[18:07:26] <gataraid> jQuery('ul.wpsc_top_level_categories ul.wpsc_second_level_categories:has(> li)').addClass('parent'); - this works but it is adding it to ul.wpsc_second_level_categories, anyway to add the class to ul.wpsc_top_level_categories li a ?
[18:12:15] <JessC> @gataraid can you give an example of the html?
[18:12:29] <gataraid> JessC - yes ma'am/sir
[18:12:36] <JessC> sir
[18:13:21] <JessC> << The troubles with having a unisex name :(
[18:14:56] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/Z7uHYquw
[18:15:29] <gataraid> JessC, I try to say sir/ma'am when speaking to anyone honestly... didn't have anything to do with your SN
[18:15:30] <gataraid> :)
[18:15:40] <gataraid> just a fyi
[18:17:27] <gataraid> actually, wait that is wrong :s
[18:17:56] <JessC> the html?
[18:19:00] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/DbbYaQpB
[18:19:09] <gataraid> yes sir
[18:19:12] <gataraid> this is correct
[18:19:13] <gataraid> sorry
[18:19:52] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/MY47FXP3 - would this work ?
[18:20:10] <JessC> give me a sec, hamster wheel is turning
[18:21:35] <gataraid> nope, that jquery adds to all still :(
[18:23:27] <raj> how do you dictate what part of a page will be cached?
[18:26:46] <fission6> and recs for lazy loading images?
[18:26:48] <gataraid> jQuery('ul.wpsc_second_level_categories:has(> li)').parents().addClass('parent'); - this adds to both parents, li and ul
[18:26:50] <JessC> @gataraid
[18:26:52] <JessC> â€‹$(function() {
[18:26:53] <JessC>     $('.wpsc_top_level_categories li').each(function() {
[18:26:53] <JessC>     $('a:first', this).css({"background-image" : "", "background-repeat" : "no-repeat", "padding-left" : "25px", "width" : "220px"});
[18:26:53] <JessC>     });
[18:26:53] <JessC> });â€‹
[18:27:08] <tw2113> pastebinplz
[18:28:32] <gataraid> adds to all :(
[18:30:56] <gataraid> Got it :)
[18:31:04] <gataraid> jQuery('ul.wpsc_second_level_categories:has(> li)').parent().addClass('hasChildren');
[18:31:05] <gataraid> :D
[18:31:55] <JessC> @gataraid http://pastebin.com/ccErbfd9
[18:33:21] <JessC> that will traverse the ui's and won't go past the top level of li
[18:33:24] <JessC> :)O
[18:33:37] <recurse> yes the other way around did wonders
[18:34:03] <recurse> but now i have both ways .. if they refresh the iframe, it checks, or if they trigger from parent, it also go through its paces ... very nifty
[18:34:16] <recurse> i wish i can show you guys the UI, its quite sexy
[18:34:32] <recurse> (but its an admin of an ecommerce platform, so access is denied)
[18:34:56] <rycar> how do I get an array of attr on an object?  for example with <img src="asdf" class="jkl"> I want to return ['asdf','jkl']
[18:35:04] <JessC> @recurse access is never denied, just highly frowned upon
[18:36:12] <JessC> @rycar create for loop and iterate through the array pushing it into a new object
[18:36:24] <recurse> from my parent frame i was able to simple do - $("#myframe").contents().find("#chartHeight").animate({height : '350px'});
[18:36:39] <rycar> I don't know how to get it into the array in the first place though, I'm trying to figure out how to return the array of attribute names
[18:37:12] <recurse> as a side note, this iframe is a dynamically height resizing frame, which adds to the clusterfug... what i had to do is grow some tables and graphs as i collapsed a side panel ...
[18:38:01] <recurse> also needed to compensate for the resizing and ensure my iframe resizing adjusted so i  did -   $("#myframe").contents().find("body").css('height','+=82');
[18:38:55] <JessC> @rycar http://pastebin.com/VMBChFA5
[18:39:23] <JessC> you could use jquery to select the images, jquery returns you an array
[18:39:37] <JessC> $('img']) = an array
[18:40:31] <JessC> $('img')
[18:42:11] <rycar> I'm sorry, I said object, but I meant the thing that gets returned when you do a jQuery select, such as jQuery('<div class="mno" data-whatever="pqr" />')
[18:42:22] <rycar> which looks like an array containing an element
[18:42:27] <JessC> it is
[18:42:39] <JessC> you can manipulate it just like an array
[18:42:54] <coldhead> except for push/pop/shift/unshift/slice
[18:43:28] <gnarf> rycar: why do you want every attribute of an element? are you looking for specific attributes?
[18:43:36] <rycar> I can get the value of data-whatever by doing this: jQuery('<div class="mno" data-whatever="pqr" />').attr('data-whatever')
[18:43:48] <rycar> but what I need to know is what the name of "data-whatever" is in the first place
[18:44:08] <rycar> I am not looking for specific elements
[18:44:22] <gnarf> rycar: sounds smelly to me - needing to read all the attributes
[18:45:16] <coldhead> rycar: http://jsfiddle.net/ZtQf2/
[18:46:01] <gnarf> rycar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L245-L257 this code out of jQuery's .fn.data function which reads all the attributes shows how to do it though. DOMElement.attributes is an array of attribute objects with a .name attribute
[18:46:17] <rycar> coldhead: that is closer, but I also need the non-data tags
[18:46:33] <rycar> gnarf: thanks!
[18:47:00] <coldhead> also go with the gnarfy solution <3
[18:47:10] <coldhead> dude knows what she's talking about
[18:48:47] <hugo_g> well
[18:48:57] <hugo_g> i just realized
[18:49:04] <hugo_g> jcarousel doesnt support variable sized widths
[18:49:17] <hugo_g> apparently you have to set all images to the same width height
[18:49:24] <hugo_g> what kind of cockoo is that
[18:49:28] <rycar> got it now, wish I thought to look at the jQuery source myself.  Thanks everyone!         jQuery('<div class="whatever" />')[0].attributes[0].name
[18:50:12] <coldhead> happy hacking rycar!
[18:57:31] <coldhead> this is slightly OT but does anyone have any links about how the current israel palestine thing is a sure sign of the last days?
[18:57:37] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[18:58:26] <rycar> coldhead: I have been to the future, this planet will be around at least another 1200 years.  past that I can't make any guarantees
[18:58:47] <coldhead> oh that's plenty, thanks rycar
[19:13:52] <recurse> coldhead i figured out that sorting thing
[19:14:34] <recurse> i took your advice, loaded the ajax content to a container, hide the other grid stuff, and then emtpy()'ied it when switchig back ...
[19:14:48] <recurse> when loading the list view i just go through the ajax request again
[19:15:25] <coldhead> man i'm sorry that's so messy
[19:15:35] <recurse> yes it is!
[19:15:35] <coldhead> i hope you put some good comments in there for whoever gets to maintain that
[19:15:43] <recurse> did you take a peak? if you recall the url
[19:15:43] <coldhead> and i hope you got yourself some icecream or something
[19:15:48] <coldhead> a good beer float
[19:15:53] <coldhead> i haven't even looked

[19:17:07] <recurse> its actually pretty quick, but yes, rather friggin retarded becuase i cant figure out another way
[19:17:25] <coldhead> i still blame that popup plugin
[19:17:33] <recurse> oh
[19:17:38] <recurse> so i moved all the code out
[19:17:42] <recurse> or what i could
[19:17:45] <recurse> and i busted it
[19:18:05] <recurse> so it needs the instance level instances of every instance of those instances of js
[19:18:07] <recurse> meh
[19:18:11] <coldhead> that's what's so gross
[19:18:18] <recurse> aye
[19:18:18] <coldhead> but hey this works!
[19:18:19] <coldhead> yay
[19:18:23] <recurse> haha exactly
[19:18:30] <coldhead> no one will ever know the trauma behind the scenes
[19:18:37] <recurse> lol exactly
[19:18:42] <coldhead> i hope your next problems have much more elegant solutions
[19:18:45] <coldhead> you sure earned that at least
[19:18:54] <recurse> if only they knew chimps wher eunder the hood
[19:19:36] <recurse> you may like the bar at the top

[19:21:28] <mwmnj> Hey all, anyone know of any outlets (forums, usergroups) worth sharing a jQuery plugin I recently authored on?
[19:21:29] <mwmnj> http://mwmnj.github.com/listy-text/
[19:21:34] <coldhead> oh yes, that's gorgeous recurse
[19:21:40] <recurse> =)
[19:21:42] <recurse> thanks
[19:22:19] <coldhead> mwmnj: http://jster.net/
[19:23:33] <coldhead> and reddit, hacker news, twitter

[19:27:02] <coldhead> good luck!
[20:25:38] <UmBaros>  Hi
[21:40:29] <coldhead> ghost town
[22:00:50] <Sd_Cheek> hi
[22:01:28] <coldhead> hey BB
[22:08:14] <aqeel> hi room
[22:08:25] <Sd_Cheek> hi aqeel
[22:17:31] <tw2113> coldhead, wanna help me out with a small issue?
[22:18:00] <coldhead> not particularly but that's how i feel about all issues
[22:18:01] <coldhead> shoot
[22:18:29] <tw2113> using run of the mill if-statement to check for an empty href attribute
[22:18:56] <tw2113> and if that evaluates to true, i want to remove the child img of just that link
[22:19:08] <tw2113> what i have now removes ALL images
[22:19:22] <tw2113> not sure if "this" is applicable as i have no events going on
[22:20:17] <tw2113> i can demo it if needed
[22:20:36] <coldhead> yes because what you described works fine in my imagination
[22:24:45] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/izipex/1/edit
[22:25:00] <tw2113> coldhead,
[22:25:38] <Malvagio87> so
[22:25:55] <Malvagio87> anyonew know where i should put http://pastie.org/5404760 in http://pastie.org/5404765?
[22:26:23] <tw2113> line 63 area
[22:28:28] <coldhead> tw2113: jQuery(this + ' img').remove(); should be jQuery('img', this).remove();
[22:28:57] <coldhead> otherwise your selector will become jQuery('object [object] img')
[22:29:24] <tw2113> hmm
[22:29:50] <Malvagio87> i dont know why this isnt working right
[22:30:15] <coldhead> that works for me once you spell jQuery correctly, tw2113
[22:30:23] <tw2113> i suppose it's spelled "jQuery" and not "jQuey"
[22:30:24] <Malvagio87> im trying to install http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Examples
[22:31:15] <coldhead> oh wait no it doesn't
[22:31:19] <coldhead> this will still be window there
[22:31:30] <Malvagio87> http://pastie.org/5404787 is what i have so far
[22:31:36] <Malvagio87> but when i click on the header it doesnt sort
[22:32:12] <tw2113> i'm basically trying to cheat and get rid of the "broken image" icon thing
[22:32:16] <coldhead> tw2113: http://jsbin.com/izipex/3/edit
[22:32:31] <tw2113> yay
[22:33:27] <Malvagio87> anyone?
[22:34:48] <tw2113> Malvagio87, it almost looks like you have 2 copies of jquery loaded
[22:35:02] <tw2113> jquery-latest.js and jquery.js
[22:35:12] <Malvagio87> yea i just deleted the secodn one
[22:35:24] <coldhead> Malvagio87: are you seeing any errors in the console?
[22:35:42] <Malvagio87> meaning?
[22:35:52] <Malvagio87> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/ is the page
[22:35:56] <Malvagio87> there are no errors
[22:36:05] <coldhead> in the console
[22:36:10] <coldhead> the javascript console
[22:36:15] <coldhead> which browser are you testing in?
[22:36:50] <Malvagio87> chrome
[22:37:01] <tw2113> thanks coldhead, before i forget to say that
[22:37:20] <coldhead> Malvagio87: right click on the page and choose "Inspect Element"
[22:37:28] <coldhead> then click on the "Console" tab in the inspector
[22:37:35] <coldhead> see if there's any angry red messages
[22:37:57] <coldhead> tw2113: you're welcome as ever <3
[22:37:59] <Malvagio87> not that i see
[22:38:28] <coldhead> do you have this somewhere online Malvagio87?
[22:38:30] <tw2113> i wish the table sorter site would connect
[22:38:37] <tw2113> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/
[22:38:41] <tw2113> he pasted it already
[22:39:03] <Malvagio87> http://pastie.org/5404799 and that s the php on there
[22:40:03] <coldhead> it looks like the code is working
[22:40:10] <coldhead> in that i can see the tablesorter class being added
[22:40:23] <coldhead> but... the table seems to be comprised exclusively of -s
[22:40:28] <coldhead> which don't sort very well
[22:40:50] <Malvagio87> im only doing it for the player names right now
[22:41:03] <Malvagio87> in my css i dont have a mytable id
[22:42:42] <Malvagio87> and there is nothing on the site that says to put anything is the css file
[22:44:15] <tw2113> coldhead, i'm not sure it's sorting at all
[22:44:16] <coldhead> holy shit i just got a banner ad for my own company's products on the tablesorter site
[22:44:28] <coldhead> do i get a prize or something?
[22:44:49] <tw2113> i just did an each() statement to turn the table cells into numbers
[22:44:59] <tw2113> and they still don't sort, unless it's only ascending
[22:45:17] <coldhead> Malvagio87: when i run $('#mytable').tablesorter() at the JS console
[22:45:25] <coldhead> i can sort the player names
[22:45:30] <coldhead> so it must not be being applied
[22:48:19] <coldhead> now it looks a lot like you've removed the tablesorter code entirely >_<
[22:49:37] <Malvagio87> so hwo do i fix it
[22:50:56] <MagePsycho> how to implement onclick event on a method which already has onclick="somethod", i want to do it obstrusive way
[22:52:12] <coldhead> put the code which nearly worked back in, Malvagio87
[22:52:18] <coldhead> and we'll help you fix it
[22:52:22] <Malvagio87> ok
[22:52:24] <Malvagio87> i put it back in
[22:52:41] <Malvagio87> http://pastie.org/5404842
[22:52:55] <coldhead> oh i got it Malvagio87
[22:53:10] <coldhead> you have a <script> with a src AND code before the </script>
[22:53:15] <coldhead> you need one or the other
[22:53:23] <coldhead> so a script src="" to include tablesorter
[22:53:35] <coldhead> and another <script> ur code here </script>
[22:53:52] <coldhead> capiche?
[22:54:05] <tw2113> <script type="text/javascript" src="asset/js/jquery.tablesorter.js"></script>
[22:54:18] <coldhead> danke
[22:54:21] <Malvagio87> im confused
[22:54:39] <tw2113> <script>$(document).ready(function() { $("#myTable").tablesorter(); } );</script>
[22:54:55] <tw2113> separate your script tags
[22:57:06] <tw2113> working for me now
[22:57:22] <coldhead> Malvagio87: https://paste.lugons.org/show/hSVzNOS7rLkNCqd2xqZl/
[22:57:28] <Malvagio87> i got it
[22:57:31] <Malvagio87> thank you
[22:57:36] <coldhead> awesome
[22:57:51] <coldhead> and that's another bug you can look forward to avoiding in the future!
[22:58:50] <coldhead> MagePsycho: decency forbids me from helping you do things obtrusively
[22:58:54] <coldhead> it's just not how i was raised
[22:59:31] <coldhead> what you're trying to do is exactly why we moved to unobtrusive
[23:03:00] <Malvagio87> coldhead do you know how i could make another column and have it add up all of the sums?
[23:06:04] <Malvagio87> still there coldhead?
[23:09:01] <coldhead> Malvagio87: it's best if you can add the extra column in the HTML
[23:09:13] <coldhead> so tablesorter won't freak out if you try to add it later
[23:09:34] <Malvagio87> i did
[23:09:36] <coldhead> you'd need to run a fairly basic jQ function to do the actual summing
[23:09:46] <Malvagio87> but i dont know how to get it to sum the other tables
[23:09:51] <coldhead> and then you need to call some tablesorter function to let it know you've updated it
[23:11:02] <coldhead> you want to sum each row?
[23:12:24] <coldhead> i'm on it, Malvagio87
[23:12:38] <Malvagio87> i want to some each row not column
[23:14:26] <tw2113> ?offset @ tw2113
[23:14:27] <bot-t> tw2113, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[23:14:51] <tw2113> nope, that's not what i'd need
[23:17:25] <coldhead> Malvagio87: http://jsfiddle.net/KJ6sT/
[23:18:05] <coldhead> might have to fudge that but it's a decent start i hope
[23:21:16] <Malvagio87> so where do i put what
[23:21:19] <Malvagio87> coldhead
[23:21:42] <coldhead> after the tablesorter code
[23:21:58] <coldhead> inside <script></script>
[23:22:18] <coldhead> you will have to make some independent efforts here, i am about to go home
[23:25:31] <Malvagio87> i did that but i obviously need to put something else somewhere
[23:26:29] <djsounds02> Hey Guys, anybody available?
[23:27:21] <coldhead> Malvagio87: it needs to go in a $(document).ready() function same as table sorter
[23:27:29] <coldhead> or better still, stick it in the one you already have
[23:27:39] <coldhead> immediately after the line wher eyou apply tablesorter
[23:27:41] <Malvagio87> i did but it isn t outputting the infromation
[23:28:26] <coldhead> sigh
[23:29:37] <coldhead> https://paste.lugons.org/show/jq50mmEg4VpkrCOWeBG9/
[23:29:55] <Malvagio87> http://pastie.org/5404928
[23:30:09] <coldhead> ?ready @ Malvagio87
[23:30:09] <bot-t> Malvagio87, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:30:42] <coldhead> you don't need to pastie it, Malvagio87, i am looking at the live code you linked to
[23:31:05] <Malvagio87> updated it
[23:31:07] <relipse> any contract-programmers interested in a new web site I just created for contract time logging?
[23:32:27] <Malvagio87> coldhead the sum column is blacnk ... what should i put in the index file
[23:32:53] <relipse> hey coldhead: did you see the new site redesign since you last checked: http://cworklog.com
[23:33:02] <coldhead> it's throwing an error, Malvagio87: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL"
[23:33:06] <Malvagio87> http://pastie.org/5404934
[23:33:30] <Malvagio87> i have to put something in between <td></td>
[23:33:52] <Malvagio87> so it puts the sum data there
[23:34:37] <coldhead> no you don't
[23:34:45] <coldhead> it automatically puts it in the 2nd column
[23:34:55] <coldhead> try replacing your code with this https://paste.lugons.org/show/3iap0vnaMJ902xZo1Jvm/
[23:35:07] <coldhead> i tidied it up with http://jsbeautifier.org/
[23:36:41] <coldhead> i haven't had a decent moment to check it out yet relipse
[23:36:43] <coldhead> i will do
[23:36:53] <coldhead> when i don't have a CEO breathing into my head
[23:38:26] <Malvagio87> coldhead no it wont sort and still doesnt post the sum data
[23:38:44] <coldhead> because there is a syntax error
[23:38:52] <coldhead> take the sort code back out
[23:38:54] <coldhead> er
[23:38:57] <coldhead> take the sum code back out
[23:39:01] <coldhead> so the sort is working
[23:39:09] <coldhead> then we'll work from there
[23:41:04] <Malvagio87> ok
[23:41:07] <Malvagio87> its working again
[23:41:39] <coldhead> Malvagio87: https://paste.lugons.org/show/axoEafhf9aXGmw5hXXCr/
[23:41:43] <coldhead> that is the summing code
[23:41:51] <coldhead> in a new set of <script> tags
[23:42:05] <coldhead> so if there is a syntax error it won't effect the tablesorter code
[23:42:15] <coldhead> you got about 2 minutes to let me know how that goes
[23:42:19] <coldhead> then i'm going home
[23:42:21] <coldhead> >_>
[23:42:35] <Malvagio87> not working
[23:43:10] <coldhead> you're a communicative fellow aren't you
[23:43:31] <Malvagio87> its not posting any values for the second row
[23:43:37] <Malvagio87> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/
[23:46:38] <Malvagio87> still getting syntax error
[23:47:02] <coldhead> yes i can see that
[23:47:51] <coldhead> i retyped it
[23:47:57] <coldhead> maybe this will magically fix it
[23:47:58] <coldhead> https://paste.lugons.org/show/xUB52AdqjJm1gpO1pEfz/
[23:48:51] <Malvagio87> nope
[23:49:23] <coldhead> it works on jsfiddle
[23:49:28] <coldhead> and it stops working when you paste it
[23:49:31] <coldhead> WHY GOD WHY
[23:50:39] <coldhead> maybe this one? https://paste.lugons.org/show/UfKpoHHYatQGGYtMtpeU/
[23:51:11] <Malvagio87> nope
[23:55:38] <Malvagio87> the values are alues beingpulled by a mysql database if that helps
[23:55:50] <coldhead> thanks
[23:56:24] <coldhead> let's try this one https://paste.lugons.org/show/5n8uj9YnNL34lIF0kNjr/
[23:56:59] <Malvagio87> nope
[23:57:10] <tw2113> coldhead, is jquery being a scumbag?
[23:57:39] <coldhead> Malvagio87: try adding // to the start of this line $(this).find('td:nth(1)').text(sum);
[23:57:47] <coldhead> before the $
[23:57:49] <Malvagio87> here is the db.php if it helps http://pastie.org/5405009
[23:57:54] <coldhead> please i just want to go home
[23:58:42] <Malvagio87> still no =(
[23:59:06] <relipse>  can any of you guys try out my new website cworklog.com and tell me if it would work for a contract-programmer?
[23:59:32] <relipse> coldhead: why do you have a CEO breathing down your head
[23:59:51] <coldhead> it's the way of our business
