[00:21:00] <jop008> Is it possible to change the id of an element?

[01:42:24] <Whirl3d> jop008, yes
[01:42:42] <Whirl3d> edop, not here
[01:42:54] <jop008> but bad practice I think
[01:43:14] <Whirl3d> Depends on the situation, but generally speaking I would say yes
[01:44:02] <Whirl3d> $("#oldID").prop("id","newID");
[01:59:57] <jop008> I have a special div like this <div data-type="select_auto" data-multi=true data-placeholder="Kies plaats" data-label="Plaats:" data-id="plaats"></div> there must be a dataprovider for the selectlist. How to pass this along?
[02:00:26] <jop008> The dataprovider asks the database what select options there are routine can be different per div
[02:01:21] <jop008> like this data=provider=name of a function?
[02:07:51] <joobie> hey guys.. is there something wrong iwht this? http://pastebin.com/U28gQ67r
[02:07:59] <joobie> when i click on an input button, i dont get the popup
[02:09:43] <joobie> y0?
[02:09:44] <g0ne> you want to bind on all input elements? Why don't you give the button an id?
[02:10:52] <jop008> is this a good way to fetch data odata = eval (ofunction);
[02:10:52] <joobie> yea
[02:10:58] <jop008> thanks
[02:11:08] <joobie> well ideally want to die just to a name, but i cant even get it firing on all input elements atm

[02:52:43] <otisZart> Hello people, I just discovered about 'jquery-mobile'. My question is: Can I use it in my main site or usually it is better to build a totally custom mobile site?
[02:54:55] <dhirnitish> how can i use javascript this.value function
[02:54:58] <dhirnitish> in jquery ?
[02:55:18] <otisZart> dhirnitish $( this ).val();
[02:56:19] <joobie> no one is here otisZart
[02:56:25] <joobie> there are 705 users here
[02:56:28] <joobie> but they are all afk
[02:56:42] <otisZart> joobie shall I enter #jquerymobile-dev to ask this question?
[02:59:37] <joobie> fuked if i know
[03:02:03] <otisZart> :/
[03:07:01] <otisZart> is sizzle after all a $ ( 'jquery-selector' ) without jquery's methos?
[03:39:59] <jop008> I have this in my code themes/jquery.mobile.icons.min.css where can I find this file?
[03:46:13] <drkshadow> Help with sliteUp? It just.. BAM.. gone. No slide animation at all.
[03:46:30] <drkshadow> Does it not work on table elements?
[03:47:27] <dhirnitish> you mean slideup()?
[03:47:42] <drkshadow> well, slideUp..
[03:48:32] <dhirnitish> you want table to slideup ?
[03:48:47] <drkshadow> yep.
[03:49:00] <dhirnitish> then put the table inside a div
[03:49:06] <dhirnitish> and apply the function
[03:49:08] <dhirnitish> i will work
[03:50:04] <jop008> where do I find this file /themes/jquery.mobile.icons.min.css
[03:50:41] <dhirnitish> slideUp( "slow", function());
[03:50:50] <dhirnitish> make sure you give ti some sort of speed
[03:50:55] <dhirnitish> for the animation to worl
[03:50:58] <dhirnitish> work*
[03:53:22] <drkshadow> hmm. Documentation seems to be incorrect.. "Description: Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion." -> _div_ elements.
[03:53:52] <drkshadow> or, elements with height attribute.
[03:58:22] <drkshadow> I have a div, with a table inside it. When I click the div, outside the table, I want to perform an event, and I have an onclick to do that. However, when I click the table itself, that event is still performed. How can I prevent the bubble up?
[03:58:36] <drkshadow> nm, stopPropagation.
[04:04:36] <drkshadow> Does .slideUp not work on <li> either?
[04:05:11] <drkshadow> no, because it would still make it disappear..
[04:15:57] <drkshadow> slideup does not work on <li>.
[04:44:07] <jayke> hey does anyone know why the first time _user returns the value, and the second time it returns a blank string? http://pastebin.com/fiU0903j
[04:47:49] <tp43_> what is the best validation plugin? I tried http://formvalidator.net but it doesn't work on select elements. Like it allows submit, but if you select a drop down, the warning doesn't remove itself like others.
[05:08:34] <jop008>   var oel = $("#"+ othis.fieldname +"_field");   oel[0].autocomplete({
[05:08:53] <jop008> undefined inpecting the element seems to be okay
[05:14:11] <drkshadow> what's oel.length?
[05:15:14] <engammalsko> how can i make the function alert the current iteration instead of the max? http://jsfiddle.net/LN2T7/
[05:17:18] <Guest___> anyone know of an app (has to be command line accessible) that can print HTML pages?
[05:17:29] <Guest___> print to PDF, specifically
[05:17:44] <jop008> I want to do an autocomplete on this field <input type="text" id="plaats_field" placeholder="Kies plaats" name="plaats_field" class="ui-input-text ui-body-c">
[05:17:57] <Guest___> not totally the right channel, but tbh, no idea where to look
[05:17:59] <jop008> is this possible?
[05:18:36] <Guest___> don't see why you can't do autocomplete on any input[type=text]
[05:18:58] <engammalsko> Guest___: maybe a channel specific to your OS?
[05:20:55] <Guest___> wouldn't be specific enough
[05:21:36] <engammalsko> Guest___: http://www.cyberciti.biz/open-source/html-to-pdf-freeware-linux-osx-windows-software/
[05:23:44] <Guest___> hmm, might have to give that one a try
[05:23:44] <Guest___> thanks
[05:27:11] <jop008> any help on this Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[05:27:45] <Guest___> are you calling it on a jQuery object?
[05:27:56] <Guest___> do you have autocomplete loaded?
[05:33:38] <engammalsko> how can i make my li's alert 0,1,2,3,4 instead of 5? http://jsfiddle.net/LN2T7/
[05:35:46] <Guest___> engammalsko: http://jsfiddle.net/LN2T7/1/
[05:40:23] <engammalsko> Guest___: Awesome! I wonder why the alert(i); doesn't work... Is it because it's in a callback function that will be executed after the iteration is done or something?
[05:40:38] <ocm> howdy
[05:41:39] <Guest___> engammalsko: it's because it's reading i from the loop
[05:42:16] <ocm> does anyone know; is it possible to output from php _during_ an ajax request, so before .done()
[05:42:18] <ocm> ?
[05:42:30] <Guest___> the for loop has completed and i has a value of 5 already
[05:42:47] <Guest___> and when you click, all you're asking for it to do is print out what i currently is
[05:43:07] <Guest___> it's a scoping thing, and by extension, a little on closures
[05:47:52] <Guest___> alternative: http://jsfiddle.net/LN2T7/2/
[05:48:08] <drkshadow> I have a div.. when I hover over a link, it will slideDown the div for as long as the mouse is over the link/div. If I mouse out, and then quickly mouse back, it'll slide out, back up, andthen cycle slide in-out for as long as the mouse is over the div. What's up with that? :-/
[05:48:33] <Guest___> the slidedown/up actions are queued
[05:49:00] <drkshadow> guest: It does it ad infinium without me moving my mouse, as long as the mouse stays where the div should appear.
[05:49:02] <Guest___> you'd have to call .stop()
[05:49:15] <drkshadow> .stop on what?
[05:49:22] <Guest___> hang on, lemme reread
[05:49:59] <drkshadow> I see..
[05:50:07] <Guest___> when it's 'cycling' up and down
[05:50:55] <Guest___> is the div, by sliding up and down, actually triggering mosueout/in?
[05:51:10] <engammalsko> Guest___: I see ^-^ Also I guess it would make more sense to use a button tag inside my li.
[05:51:21] <Guest___> because if it shrinks away from the cursor, it'll trigger mouse out, even if you don't move the cursor
[05:51:29] <drkshadow> That's curious.. in my hover, if I .stop(true).slide<otherway>(400), it will stop the slide with the box partially shown. It's like the .stop(true) happans asynchronously. is that correct??
[05:52:00] <Guest___> you can use slideToggle()
[05:52:09] <Guest___> yeah, it kills all animations
[05:52:10] <Guest___> on that element
[05:52:24] <Guest___> pauses
[05:52:29] <drkshadow> .stop().slide() -- it should stop then start agin.
[05:52:40] <iSDP> how come this ain't working? http://jsfiddle.net/aWR7a/
[05:52:49] <drkshadow> but, toggle then..
[05:53:04] <iSDP> it's pretty self-explanatory, so, take a look..
[05:53:16] <drkshadow> Toggle has the same effect -- it'll go up-down-up-down ad infinium.
[05:53:30] <Guest___> do you have an example?
[05:53:36] <Guest___> @ drkshadow
[05:53:41] <drkshadow> Got an HTML-paste url?
[05:53:52] <Guest___> just need a working sample
[05:53:57] <Guest___> jsfiddle or codepen, or whatever
[05:55:37] <Guest___> iSDP: you need the # for id selectors http://jsfiddle.net/aWR7a/1/
[05:56:04] <iSDP> ugh, now i feel stupid, rookie mistake >_>
[05:58:07] <drkshadow> http://jsfiddle.net/f9ZyE/ -- move the mouse up and down over SPAM a couple times, and stop with the mouse below it. Toggles.
[05:59:37] <jop008> I have a input text field I got Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[06:00:03] <jop008> This is the html <input type="text" id="plaats_field" placeholder="Kies plaats" class="ui-input-text ui-body-c ui-autocomplete-input" autocomplete="off">
[06:00:23] <Guest___> jop008: do you have jQuery UI on the page?
[06:00:33] <jop008> no
[06:00:38] <jop008> do I need it?
[06:00:49] <jop008> extra include?
[06:00:54] <Guest___> what autocomplete implementation are you using?
[06:00:59] <Guest___> library*
[06:01:14] <jop008> no library
[06:01:28] <jop008> 1.9.1 and mobile 1.3.2
[06:01:29] <Guest___> drkshadow: It repeats as many times as I mouseout/in
[06:01:33] <jop008> no libs
[06:01:41] <Guest___> jQuery Mobile is a library
[06:01:47] <Guest___> jQuery is a library :D
[06:01:58] <drkshadow> Guest: if you stop with the mouse cursor over the box, it keeps going.
[06:02:03] <shoky> jop008: you need to call .autocomplete on a jquery object, not a dom element.  so el.autocomplete()  not el[0].autocomplete()
[06:02:05] <Guest___> which box?
[06:02:12] <drkshadow> The hey hey hey underneath spam.
[06:02:23] <jop008> I did
[06:02:33] <Guest___> drkshadow: yeah that's what I suspected
[06:02:37] <shoky> does jquery mobile even have a .autocomplete() method
[06:02:44] <Guest___> the box itself is growing and shrinking
[06:02:49] <Guest___> shoky: no
[06:02:58] <Guest___> it's has it's own thing
[06:03:05] <jop008> this is the code   var oel = $("#"+ othis.fieldname + "_field");   oel.autocomplete({
[06:03:22] <drkshadow> That was my thought.. so, .stop(true) on it to stop the previous events and clear the queue and then another .slideblah to start it again.. should come back out if mouseover. But no.
[06:03:23] <wolthers> anyone have any good resources on paint performance of infinite scrolling grid layouts?
[06:03:24] <Guest___> drkshadow: the hey/hey/hey is causing the mousein as it grows
[06:03:24] <shoky> jop008 where did you read that you're supposed to call it like that
[06:03:29] <drkshadow> I'm having trouble reproducing that.
[06:03:48] <jop008> I have a working example
[06:04:03] <jop008> which I am trying to make more general
[06:04:07] <Guest___> are you doing a dropdown?
[06:04:11] <Guest___> @ drkshadow
[06:04:14] <shoky> follow the docs
[06:04:23] <Guest___> quack quack
[06:04:50] <drkshadow> http://jsfiddle.net/4x22p/1/ -- here. Mouse over spam. Hey hey hey. Mouse out. It goes away. Mouse _over_ it as it starts sliding up, it stops, and does not slide back out.
[06:05:38] <jop008> I do it like this http://pastebin.com/PBbJycwv
[06:05:49] <Guest___> jop008: it's on the demo page... http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/widgets/autocomplete/
[06:05:54] <jop008> Inserting some elements
[06:06:02] <jop008> I have a working example
[06:06:16] <Guest___> yeah
[06:06:17] <shoky> jop008: does that working example include jquery-ui?
[06:06:23] <jop008> no
[06:06:25] <Guest___> no it doesn't
[06:06:31] <jop008> same includes
[06:06:48] <Guest___> jQuery Mobile doesn't play nice with jQuery UI, I don't think
[06:06:58] <shoky> then i'm confused
[06:07:13] <Guest___> autocomplete is jQuery UI. He's using the wrong library with the wrong widgets
[06:07:26] <shoky> then how does he have a working example without jquery-ui?
[06:07:27] <Guest___> jop008: use this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/widgets/autocomplete/
[06:07:44] <Guest___> well, he doesn't have a working example of autocomplete
[06:07:53] <Guest___> which is the error he keeps posting
[06:07:54] <jop008> see the code
[06:07:57] <shoky> that clears it up then..
[06:08:13] <drkshadow>  guest: not really a dropdown..
[06:08:21] <Guest___> jop008: use the link a few posts up
[06:08:25] <shoky> jop008: where's the working example
[06:08:28] <jop008> Sorry it has
[06:09:53] <drkshadow> .stop(true, true) seems to work.
[06:10:25] <sammich_> drkshadow: yeah, you need to read the sample code
[06:10:28] <sammich_> api, sorry
[06:10:43] <jop008> issue solved thanks for help
[06:10:54] <drkshadow> sammich: Wow. You're an idiot.
[06:11:10] <sammich_> jop008: are you building a mobile app?
[06:11:16] <sammich_> drkshadow: please explain?
[06:11:33] <jop008> yes try to make it as user friendly as possible
[06:11:35] <drkshadow> sammich: If you review the chat that I've had with guest, it should be obvious.
[06:11:50] <drkshadow> Anyway, thanks, Guest. Later all.
[06:11:51] <sammich_> sorry, it happens I am guest__
[06:11:57] <shoky> lol
[06:12:01] <drkshadow> Huh. Interesting.
[06:12:16] <sammich_> when you call stop, the 'max-height' css is set
[06:12:22] <shoky> that'll teach you some manners, drkshadow
[06:12:28] <sammich_> slideup and down still move to that setting I think
[06:12:32] <drkshadow> None of the issues that I've described are covered in the documentation at all. They tend to be bugs, or at least weird gotchas, related to doing things too fast.
[06:12:49] <sammich_> drkshadow: which is why I asked if you were doing a dropdown
[06:12:56] <sammich_> because I'd recommend you do it in CSS
[06:13:01] <drkshadow> sammich: when I call .stop(), and then call .slide..() again, I expect it would start sliding, not remain stopped. Bug.
[06:13:55] <drkshadow> So anyway.. good night, all.
[06:14:20] <sammich_> I'm not sure what's wrong there
[06:52:43] <tp43_> anyone know how to do ajax with this: http://jquery.homerocavazos.com/formvalidation
[07:04:03] <c0mrade_> WriteLn.Console("Hello");
[07:05:33] <c0mrade_> I have a javascript object named "Browser" and it outputs like that for example: "IE 8 on Windows 7". Now I want to pass this data to the server by using jQuery ajax post. And then saving the value in a php variable and storing it in a database.
[07:05:55] <c0mrade_> But how to pass the javascript object using jQuery AJAX post?
[07:06:38] <tp43_> http://jquery.homerocavazos.com/formvalidation where in the code does the form submission get prevented and  this js script do validation instead?
[07:08:17] <tp43_> c0mrade_, $.ajax({type:"POST", url:"phpscript.php", data:"IE 8 on Windows 7"});
[07:09:00] <c0mrade_> In data: can I put Browser?
[07:09:10] <c0mrade_> The javascript object?
[07:10:43] <tp43_> c0mrade_, hmm, not sure about json, there are a couple useful function, JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, so you can the object, it depends on reading it on php side
[07:11:48] <c0mrade_> tp43: So I can do: $.ajax({type:"POST", url:"phpscript.php", data:"JSON.stringify(Browsers)"});
[07:12:13] <c0mrade_> And then on the php side what should I do? What code should I type to receive the data?
[07:12:56] <tp43_> no, if Browsers = "IE 8 on Windows 7"; then you can just do data: Browsers
[07:13:44] <c0mrade_> No Browsers is a set of elements and stuff it contains more that that. It outputs the users OS/version and Browser/version.
[07:13:56] <c0mrade_> A fuction does that and stores it in Browsers.
[07:14:03] <tp43_> Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string.
[07:14:25] <tp43_> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:14:38] <c0mrade_> tp43: How to receive it on the PHP side/
[07:14:40] <c0mrade_> ?
[07:15:50] <tp43_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6782230/ajax-passing-data-to-php-script
[07:16:22] <tp43_> You are better off extracting the data one by one from you browsers object carefully, so that you can easily read it on the php side
[07:18:23] <c0mrade_> Um.
[07:18:43] <c0mrade_> $.ajax({type:"POST", url:"phpscript.php", data:"JSON.stringify(Browsers)"});
[07:20:00] <c0mrade_> php side will be $response = $_POST['json_decode(??)']; I don't know.
[07:20:03] <c0mrade_> ??
[07:20:04] <tp43_> c0mrade_, ahh, when you post "around something" it means a string
[07:20:50] <c0mrade_> So I can use this: $.ajax({type:"POST", url:"phpscript.php", data:"Browsers"});
[07:20:56] <tp43_> you can't just send Browsers, you have to extract whats in it, and put it in variables, like that like.  So lets see what browsers looks like and we can work from their
[07:21:40] <tp43_> data: "Browsers" will send the string "Browsers" not the browsers object.  I think you need to review basic javascript data types.  Anything inside "" means a string literal.
[07:22:08] <c0mrade_> Browsers.os would give "Windows 7" for example and Browsers.br would give "IE 8" and Browsers.device would give "Lenovo PC".
[07:22:51] <c0mrade_> And Browsers would give "IE 8 on Windows 7".
[07:24:51] <c0mrade_> Um. Can I do this then. var br = Browsers.br; var os = Browsers.os; And now I have two variables that I want to send to the server.
[07:24:57] <c0mrade_> Will it work that way.
[07:25:20] <c0mrade_> Browsers.os will output "Windows 7" and Browsers.br will output "IE8".
[07:26:08] <tp43_> ok, then just do data: broswers, and on php side you can access using $_POST['os'], $_POST['br'] and so forth
[07:26:33] <c0mrade_> I'll try.
[07:38:48] <leshanks> Hi. Is there a way of having a prompt appear when a radio button is clicked with a yes / no option - if yes, clicking the radio goes ahead, if no, it stops the click?
[07:39:28] <leshanks> (I have a form that the contents of which are changed significantly depending on the first radio button choice - I don't want some one to fill out the form then go back and change their early radio button choice so messing up the form as it will have to wipe all the other form entries)
[07:52:02] <zumba_addict> hey guys, aside from Jquery, what other complete framework would you recommend?
[08:32:52] <Atamido> Is this also the channel to post jQuery UI questions?
[08:36:09] <Atamido> Never mind, I see that it is.
[08:39:43] <Atamido> I'm looking for something like the Accordian widget, but I'm going to be using it on multiple independent boxes where I don't want others to collapse when one is expanded.  Should I be using multiple instances of the Accordian widget, or is there a more appropriate way to do what I want?
[08:40:35] <decx> it's a oneliner with no need for jq ui
[08:51:21] <Atamido> But expand/collapse of the jQuery UI widget is so pretty...
[08:56:09] <donmatthew> someone knows how I can redirect to another route (without passing the whole url) with javascript/jquery? is it possible?
[08:56:42] <donmatthew> like just "/admin/users" or something..
[08:58:29] <donmatthew> ahh.. worked like a charm with window.location.href="" lol..
[09:08:03] <jop008> I introduce this <script	src="./include/jquery-ui.js"></script> and all my select lists are ruined
[09:08:20] <jop008> jquery mobile
[09:30:07] <c0mrade_> Can someone test this link.
[09:30:08] <c0mrade_> http://93.126.201.71/
[09:32:33] <s5fs> c0mrade_: i see nothing
[09:32:43] <s5fs> it redirects me to output.php and i get no output
[09:32:56] <c0mrade_> One entry :D
[09:33:00] <c0mrade_> I see one entry in my database.
[09:33:04] <c0mrade_> It's working...!!!
[09:33:05] <c0mrade_> 71.59.146.18
[09:33:06] <c0mrade_> Chromium 32.0.1700.107 on Ubuntu
[09:33:15] <c0mrade_> :D
[09:34:09] <c0mrade_> You see nothing. But what I've done is that I am retreiving your OS and Browser and IP and saving them into my database and it worked :D
[09:36:45] <c0mrade_> But you can refresh it now and see.
[09:36:50] <c0mrade_> I've just added one line of text.
[09:36:59] <c0mrade_> Can you referesh so that I make sure?
[09:41:39] <Jattenalle> c0mrade_, what would happen if i made a script that sends 5000 GET's/second to that page? :3
[09:42:33] <c0mrade_> Jattenalle: 5000/sec? Can your software/hardware acheive that?
[09:42:44] <c0mrade_> I don't know if cURL can do it.
[09:43:06] <Jattenalle> i could push it up to 50k/sec if you really want a stresstest :P
[09:43:16] <Jattenalle> just need to tell all my servers to say hello :3
[09:43:40] <Jattenalle> my point being: might wanna be careful about having database stuff trigger on a simple page get
[09:43:41] <dismist> thats fucking impossible
[09:44:02] <c0mrade_> Stress test? Oh you mean you're going to use a source online. Like a webserver online capable of stress testing maybe.
[09:44:30] <Jattenalle> c0mrade_, no, i'd just set up some of my servers to run a simple script to get the page over and over..
[09:44:46] <Jattenalle> c0mrade_, i mean, it's hypotethical, im far too lazy to actually set it up right now
[09:45:08] <c0mrade_> Well it will only get one entry in the database if the source IP is the same. If you're going to use proxies that's another story.
[09:45:15] <Jattenalle> ah
[09:45:23] <Jattenalle> then no problem :)
[09:45:28] <dismist> even with proxies
[09:45:30] <dismist> impossible
[09:45:40] <Jattenalle> heh, using proxies isnt really possible to get any kind of high numbers
[09:45:41] <c0mrade_> dismist: Why not?
[09:45:58] <c0mrade_> He could build a simple web bot.
[09:45:58] <Jattenalle> what's impossible dismist?
[09:46:24] <dismist> proxies require you initializing a connection with them (ping delay), even if you multi-thread it the delay is all in the milliseconds it takes to get the response back
[09:46:32] <Jattenalle> well yeah
[09:46:38] <Jattenalle> but you said:  <dismist> thats fucking impossible
[09:46:43] <Jattenalle> before anyone mentioned proxies
[09:46:54] <Jattenalle> it's of course impossible to get 5k unique proxies/second :P
[09:46:58] <c0mrade_> Yes. You would want to use private proxies that are pretty fast but eventhough not enough to acheive the speed he's talking about.
[09:47:05] <Jattenalle> (unless you own a massive range of IP's but that'd just be silly)
[09:47:52] <c0mrade_> Or you have zombie pcs in many places.
[09:47:54] <Jattenalle> anyhow, just doing 5k GET's/sec, no proxies.. is easy enough
[09:48:07] <Jattenalle> but c0mrade_ already thought of that, since one entry per IP
[09:48:12] <Jattenalle> :)
[09:48:26] <c0mrade_> May crash the web server but won't crash the database.
[09:48:53] <Jattenalle> most webservers just restart if they crash anyhow :P
[09:49:35] <c0mrade_> But a one line entry in .htaccess will solve my problem hehe.
[09:50:34] <c0mrade_> Deny your_ip_subnet
[09:50:41] <Jattenalle> hehe, yeah
[09:50:54] <Jattenalle> it's a really crappy attack, good for testing though :)
[09:51:49] <c0mrade_> I've set the ip field to "unique" and used "INSERT IGNORE INTO xxx_table" in my php script to do it.
[09:54:52] <Jattenalle> yeah that should be good enough
[09:55:24] <Jattenalle> i just thought you were inserting on every get, not checking
[09:56:11] <c0mrade_> It's just that I set the field to "unique" and it does the magic. I didn't bother using any logic and stuff since this thing does it all.
[09:56:54] <Jattenalle> yeah
[09:59:19] <c0mrade_> But it's attackable :D
[10:09:00] <Hisoka> hi
[10:09:16] <Hisoka> i'm looking for a way to recover the current index position in a jcarousel, somone has any idea ?
[10:11:02] <Hisoka> this is my current code: http://pastebin.com/Ap3eACLC
[11:00:21] <m313> can someone check out http://jsbin.com/sipiruru/3/edit, when I try to integrate the javascript into the html body it doesn't seem to work.  what am I missing?
[11:01:43] <Hilton> I was told using the body to handle all events was "wrong" and to use the element's parent. But...why is the recommended event handler an element's parent and not the element itself? filter = $('#filter'); filter.on('click', filter, ...) seems to work fine ... ?
[12:54:39] <cprodigy29> How would I make a variable in a function and want to make it available to all functions
[12:58:28] <jphase> cprodigy29: declare it outside of the functions
[12:58:56] <cprodigy29> jphase: what if it's a value I get back from a function?
[12:58:59] <cprodigy29> jphase: like a token
[12:59:29] <jphase> cprodigy29: then you can set the value from that function, or you can do something like var mytoken = myfunction();  and return the value
[13:00:08] <cprodigy29> jphase: ok nice
[13:10:25] <MisutoWolf> Why isn't this thing working?  http://pastebin.com/CkK05592
[13:10:35] <MisutoWolf> jQuery is loading (I tested it with a $(document).ready() thing
[13:10:45] <MisutoWolf> but it's not doing anything when I submit the form :(
[13:13:28] <TheGallery> ad the attribute type="submit" to your button
[13:13:30] <TheGallery> add*
[13:13:54] <TheGallery> MisutoWolf ^
[13:14:26] <MisutoWolf> I did, it's still not alerting :(
[13:15:18] <TheGallery> hm let me test it
[13:15:52] <jphase> no need to add type="submit" on a button
[13:16:57] <jphase> MisutoWolf: check for errors, code works fine:   http://jsfiddle.net/qBU8x/
[13:18:23] <jphase> also, I assume you did put that in a document ready wrapper or something yes?
[13:18:34] <MisutoWolf> that's whta i forgot
[13:18:36] <MisutoWolf> haha
[13:18:38] <jphase> ah, hehe
[13:18:40] <jphase> that makes sense
[13:18:43] <cprodigy29> jphase: ok so one thing.. in the first function I'm logging in and it gives back the token value from json
[13:18:43] <MisutoWolf> i'm new to jQuery, really
[13:18:47] <MisutoWolf> thanks a lit :)
[13:18:49] <MisutoWolf> lot*
[13:19:06] <cprodigy29> jphase: now i want to use that value to for other functions.. but I don't want to run the login function again
[13:19:32] <jphase> cprodigy29: call the other functions from your ajax response in the login function and pass the token in as a parameter
[13:19:46] <cprodigy29> jphase: i had just thought of that as I hit enter lol
[13:19:53] <cprodigy29> jphase: that makes 100% sense
[13:20:06] <jphase> hehe, sometimes talking it out helps more than anything
[13:20:42] <cprodigy29> jphase: true
[13:21:08] <MisutoWolf> i've really fallen in love with JS lately as a whole
[13:21:15] <MisutoWolf> i started learning Meteor recently and coffeescript
[13:22:05] <jphase> js is pretty rad
[13:22:21] <MisutoWolf> i really didn't know it was so powerful
[13:22:26] <MisutoWolf> until i read about node and meteor
[13:22:27] <cprodigy29> jphase: so at the end I have 	token = myToken(data.access_token);
[13:22:31] <MisutoWolf> and then jquery also
[13:22:56] <cprodigy29> jphase: and then in the myToken() I set it to a variable?
[13:23:29] <jphase> function myToken(token) {    // do stuff with token }
[13:24:05] <jphase> pass into the function as a param and then whatever parameter name you declare it will be known as that variable inside the function
[13:24:05] <cprodigy29> jphase: so I should pass it to every function going to use it in the login function?
[13:24:19] <jphase> either that or declare it globally as we originally discussed
[13:24:36] <jphase> but either way you have to call the functions on ajax response so you might as well daisy chain them yeah
[13:25:07] <cprodigy29> jphase: ok.. how would I declare it globally from the login function?
[13:25:27] <cprodigy29> jphase: but daisy chaining sounds like the way I might go
[13:25:31] <cprodigy29> jphase: just want to know for myself
[13:26:10] <jphase> declaring globally is just a matter of like...    var token;     function myAjax(){ // in .done do token = response.token or whatever }
[13:26:19] <jphase> so you declare outside the functions
[13:26:47] <jphase> but just calling the other functions from .done and passing the token sounds cleaner tbh
[13:26:47] <cprodigy29> ok
[13:27:04] <cprodigy29> but then it's going to run those functions right?
[13:27:22] <jphase> yes
[13:27:40] <cprodigy29> jphase: like I have getContacts(); I don't want that ran right after they login but rather when they click a button
[13:27:46] <jphase> it really depends on whether or not you need to access this token later on after the ajax function is done
[13:27:58] <jphase> yeah, then you'll want something global
[13:29:18] <cprodigy29> jphase: I will need access for sure.. so at the top I set var token;
[13:29:37] <cprodigy29> jphase: in the login function in the .sucess i have token = data.access_token;
[13:29:57] <cprodigy29> jphase: but I don't think its assigning that var token; the value after
[13:30:11] <jphase> cprodigy29: hastebin/pastebin your code
[13:30:15] <cprodigy29> ok
[13:31:39] <cprodigy29> jphase: http://pastebin.com/eEEdV9GM
[13:32:28] <jphase> cprodigy29: and where is it not available?
[13:35:27] <cprodigy29> jphase: myToken
[13:35:28] <jphase> cprodigy29: are you talking about the function at the bottom myToken()?
[13:35:29] <jphase> oh
[13:35:32] <jphase> don't pass a param in there
[13:35:45] <jphase> when you pass token in that, it resets that and expects you to pass token into it
[13:36:02] <jphase> function myToken() { alert(token); }
[13:38:18] <cprodigy29> jphase: got it
[13:41:02] <cprodigy29> jphase: perfect  :D
[13:52:43] <cprodigy29> jphase: any idea why json won't set an accept and authorization header?
[13:52:54] <MisutoWolf> hm, i think i might just start using coffeescript for everything, but...i need to figure out a way to have it automatically compile stuff for me
[13:53:03] <cprodigy29> jphase: if I use curl it works just fine
[13:58:12] <paxcoder> $.ready(function(){alert('ready');}); <- i have this in a script tag below the one sourcing jquery, but nothing happens. No errors on the console.
[14:01:10] <paxcoder> Would anyonen know what's up with that?
[14:01:22] <jphase> cprodigy29: pass it in your .ajax call - there's a header:  object you can set
[14:01:54] <cprodigy29> jphase: yea I passed them.. if I pass just accept it sets it but if I pass authorization too it doesn't work
[14:02:31] <jphase> cprodigy29: show me your .ajax call
[14:03:06] <jphase> paxcoder: it's not recommended to use .ready without binding it to the document
[14:03:31] <jphase> $(document).ready(function(){ alert('ready'); });
[14:06:48] <cprodigy29> jphase: http://pastebin.com/3JwbqSd4
[14:06:53] <paxcoder> jphase, thanks
[14:10:28] <jphase> cprodigy29: that looks fine, what's not coming through?
[14:11:41] <cprodigy29> jphase: in the access-control-request-headers it says authorization
[14:11:48] <jphase> cprodigy29: you could try setting the request header in beforeSend as well
[14:11:55] <cprodigy29> jphase: and the accept isn't setting.. let me check one more thing really quick
[14:12:09] <cprodigy29> jphase: and that produced the same result.. i tried
[14:26:54] <jenia2> im adding a button to the info window for google maps. how do i add a listener for that button given that it takes time for google maps to create the info window
[14:27:08] <jenia2> in other words, i need it to execute after google maps has returned.
[14:27:22] <jenia2> after the button has been inserted into dome
[14:27:23] <jenia2> dom

[15:12:16] <Sal> hi
[15:14:49] <paxcoder> he
[15:15:34] <Sal> i have to show a div under a table selected row. in this div, there is the table selected row extended data and images. whats the best way to do it?
[15:16:12] <Sal> should i create the divs html on the selected row click event and then add it to a newly created table row?
[15:16:33] <Sal> or should i create a bottom hidden div, and then clone it on every table selected row click?
[15:16:41] <Sal> or is there a better way?
[15:57:39] <cprodigy29> is there another way to have jquery inside of quotations besides using the + ?
[15:58:08] <cprodigy29> IE 'blah' + variabe + 'blah'
[16:01:07] <cprodigy29> something like 'blah #{variable} blah'
[16:01:13] <cprodigy29> is there anything like that?
[16:06:41] <jphase> cprodigy29: no
[16:06:50] <cprodigy29> jphase: ok
[16:07:04] <cprodigy29> jphase: I got everything working now too :)
[16:07:12] <cprodigy29> jphase: it was a cors issue with the server
[16:07:26] <jphase> ahh, had a feeling you need access-control-allow-origin stuffs in there
[16:07:37] <jphase> needed*
[16:07:56] <cprodigy29> jphase: and I was.. just that the authentication was grabbing before the cors filter smh
[16:08:04] <cprodigy29> jphase: had to fix the order
[16:08:05] <jphase> doh!
[16:08:22] <cprodigy29> right lol
[16:08:58] <cprodigy29> jphase: now I need to look up security when it comes to headers
[16:09:19] <cprodigy29> jphase: origin is * now.. i think I can lock that down in production
[16:12:18] <cprodigy29> Definitely writing a blog about it though.. rails, jquery, devise, doorkeeper
[16:12:47] <cprodigy29> Now to learn a little angular.js :)
[16:14:05] <jphase> fun stuff :)
[16:22:09] <Fernandos> hi
[16:24:03] <Fernandos> I'm trying to hook a function to the event touchstart, in order to set the transition style to slide only during touch events. But it somehow doesn't work..
[16:28:30] <Fernandos> I've made a jsbin of the issue, but somehow the slideshow doesn't even show up there, although I think the code and html is correct. http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/8/edit?js,console
[16:29:09] <Fernandos> I tried the same on jsfiddle resulting in the same blank page issue. http://jsfiddle.net/6dnTZ/
[16:32:32] <bengalo> ehm
[16:32:42] <bengalo> i think you want #fotorama
[16:32:47] <bengalo> i dont see any class
[16:33:23] <joobie> guys, if i have $id = 2; and this worksâ€¦ $('input#2').val() .. how can i rewrite that to replace 2 with $id ?
[16:33:38] <joobie> so for part of my selector incorporate the variable in there
[16:34:21] <bengalo> $('input#' + $id) ?
[16:36:33] <joobie> thank you bengalo
[16:37:53] <bengalo> yw
[16:38:09] <jphase> ooo, mixitup changed their site :o
[17:23:34] <john2x> is it normal that $.ajax() sends {foo: ["a", "b"]} as "foo[]=a&foo[]=b"?
[17:24:05] <john2x> it appends "[]" to the param name..
[17:24:14] <john2x> how do I make it not do that?
[17:27:17] <MisutoWolf> Random question for you guys:  What fonts do you use for programming?  (editors)
[17:27:41] <MisutoWolf> I grabbed Source Code Pro earlier and it looked nice in Linux, but for some reason in ST3 in Windows it looks weird.
[17:30:06] <john2x> consolas?
[17:33:51] <Hilton> MisutoWolf: Do you have ClearType turned on?
[17:35:06] <Hilton> MisutoWolf: Source Code Pro and Consolas are the two most popular, I think, both free from Adobe and Microsoft. Other than Courier New of course. I used to use Lucida Sans Typewriter for something a litle different, oto.
[17:35:25] <MisutoWolf> Hm.  Not sure if I do or not.   It's a fresh win8.1 install
[17:35:46] <MisutoWolf> Yeah, it's on.
[17:36:32] <jmpp> $('.all').text('Hello');
[17:36:44] <MisutoWolf> OH, hai.
[18:07:33] <Fernandos> bengalo: ohhh how could I oversee that...
[18:13:23] <Fernandos> ok, but how do I access the fotorama object's setupOptions() function through an evenhandler? I verified that on an android device, this code is executed, but I'm getting a "TypeError: Cannot call method 'setOptions' of undefined"
[18:13:28] <Fernandos> For this code:  $('.fotorama').on('touchstart', function (e, fotorama){ fotorama.setOptions({transition: 'slide'}); })
[18:15:59] <Fernandos> here's the working jsbin http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/9/edit
[18:45:14] <bengalo> well, i think the problem is youre listing to touchstart
[18:45:20] <bengalo> and expecting fotorama
[18:45:37] <bengalo> but touchstart doesnst seem to get fired by the plugin
[18:46:11] <bengalo> youre listening to a "normal" event while the examples only show the fotorama:loaded or whatever
[18:46:45] <bengalo> so fotorama might not be there in your event
[18:49:34] <bengalo> just console.log every var and youll prob that find that fotorama is undefined
[18:49:38] <Fernandos> hmm, yeah that's right. I checked the source of fotorama and there is no such event called touchstart or touchend
[18:51:55] <bengalo> i didnt get what youre trying to do though
[18:54:39] <Fernandos> bengalo: it's a little weird, because I actually get the fotorama object, but somehow can't access the setupOptions() function
[18:55:03] <Fernandos> bengalo: hmm just want to set the transition to slide on touchStart
[18:55:12] <Fernandos> and crossfade on touchEnd
[18:56:58] <Fernandos> bengalo: when you open the chrome inspector and emulate a touchdevice, you can see that when you touch the slide it will return the fotorama object http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/11/edit
[18:57:25] <Fernandos> that's what makes my head scratch..
[19:00:17] <bengalo> trying to check
[19:00:30] <bengalo> weird controls, never emulated touch stuff before
[19:01:32] <Fernandos> yeah, if you hate that the screensize becomes smaller, hit ESC then screen and uncheck it.
[19:01:49] <Fernandos> in the inspector
[19:03:40] <bengalo> trying to find my way through inspector, i use firebug usually..
[19:03:51] <bengalo> wheres command line?
[19:03:58] <bengalo> js
[19:04:41] <bengalo> oh god..
[19:04:42] <bengalo> nvmd
[19:04:46] <Fernandos> :)
[19:05:05] <Fernandos> firefox unfortunately doesn't have a way to emulate touch events
[19:14:07] <Fernandos> I'm getting this object back on touchstart: jQuery.FotoramaÂ {startAutoplay:Â function,Â stopAutoplay:Â function,Â show:Â function,Â requestFullScreen:Â function,Â cancelFullScreen:Â functionâ€¦}
[19:15:49] <Fernandos> there is a setupOptions() function, in there. I only run var t = $($(this).data("fotorama")); so I expected t.setupOptions({transition: "slide"}); to work
[19:16:49] <Fernandos> but instead I get: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'setupOptions', which is weird, because I just saw that method in that object..
[19:19:55] <bengalo> dunno if that works
[19:20:02] <bengalo> but you could try setting it directly
[19:20:13] <bengalo> with t[0].transition = 'slide';
[19:20:43] <bengalo> http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/16/edit
[19:20:45] <bengalo> working from that one
[19:21:00] <Fernandos> interesting idea, will try
[19:21:29] <bengalo> took me a while to get to your point cuz of all that chrome mess but now im there ;)
[19:21:42] <bengalo> the object doesnt have the function youre calling
[19:21:49] <bengalo> just the properties
[19:22:08] <bengalo> i mean theres probably a reason why u have the setupOptions but still ;)
[19:22:56] <bengalo> dont forget youre using it for both events atm
[19:25:36] <Fernandos> bengalo: hmm it seems to set it to slide, but apparently it has no effect http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/19/edit
[19:27:19] <bengalo> just t[0].transition = 'slide';
[19:27:29] <bengalo> youre setting the object to the property
[19:28:59] <Fernandos> I did that earlier, but it also has no effect
[19:30:08] <bengalo> ok, cant even check the outcome cuz my window is lagging rly bad
[19:31:56] <Fernandos> yeah same here, not sure why..
[19:39:38] <bengalo> i mean you can do everything else
[19:39:51] <bengalo> like setting the index
[19:39:56] <bengalo> that works on the object
[19:40:35] <bengalo> but transition is not every an option
[19:40:46] <bengalo> sec
[19:40:48] <bengalo> maybe
[19:40:55] <Fernandos> hmm
[19:41:27] <bengalo> no, its actually
[19:41:39] <bengalo> yourobject.options.transition
[19:41:52] <bengalo> but not working either
[19:42:59] <Fernandos> yeah, I guess that's because we're changing a value without updating it's dynamic context and the value would be overriden again.
[19:43:05] <bengalo> ye
[19:43:07] <bengalo> guess so
[19:43:22] <bengalo> thats obviously what setOptions is for ;)
[19:43:27] <Fernandos> could be that there is a parent object or something that is accessible
[19:43:35] <Fernandos> I so far tried console.log($(ev.target).parent().find('.fotorama'));
[19:44:38] <Fernandos> just add the ev param to function (ev) {
[19:45:03] <Fernandos> but I'm still hanging down the "tree"
[19:45:16] <bengalo> yeah, alrady checked out event
[19:45:41] <Fernandos> it bugs me when something is so close and you can't reach it..
[19:46:10] <bengalo> hehe
[19:46:22] <bengalo> brb smoke, ill give it another try ;)
[19:46:31] <Fernandos> sure it's solution is stupid simple and we're just coming up with it
[19:46:44] <Fernandos> hehe, enjoy ;)
[19:47:37] <bengalo> working
[19:48:15] <bengalo> last word i was typing ;)
[19:48:16] <bengalo> sec
[19:48:21] <bengalo> still smoke first
[19:51:26] <gx> so i'm trying to figure out how i can take a number, let's say, 01.20500000, and identify ONLY the 1.205 part in order to make it bold. anyone know? i assume some kind of regex
[19:51:58] <gx> or another example would be .00013000, i want to highlight .00013 only
[19:52:13] <gx> basically scrapping all trailing zeros (only)
[19:52:25] <gx> but not scrapping, just making the part prior to them highlighted or bold
[19:52:38] <bengalo> http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/22/edit
[19:53:00] <bengalo> dunno if you might want to split it up or so
[19:53:07] <bengalo> but basic thing is working
[19:53:11] <bengalo> and yes, bloody obvious ;)
[19:57:26] <bengalo> yes, regex is your friend
[19:58:10] <Fernandos> omg I'm checking ..
[20:00:21] <Fernandos> bengalo: wow thanks for solving the puzzle.. what was it? That looks like the same code as earlier..
[20:01:24] <bengalo> dunno rly, i think you missed the combination somewhere
[20:02:20] <bengalo> you never simply called $('.fotorama').data('fotorama') to get the object
[20:02:37] <bengalo> something with access being o.data()
[20:04:57] <Fernandos> yeah I had $($(this).data("fotorama")) instead of $('.fotorama').data("fotorama")
[20:06:52] <Fernandos> crazy.. that was it.. just tested it
[20:07:10] <Fernandos> bengalo: wow thanks man! you saved me so much headache =) =)
[20:07:44] <bengalo> ;)
[20:07:46] <bengalo> yw
[20:08:03] <bengalo> gx btw
[20:08:10] <bengalo> 0*[1-9]*\.[1-9]*0*
[20:08:14] <bengalo> its a start if you have none ;)
[20:11:37] <gx> bengalo thanks
[20:11:42] <gx> found something on stack that's helping
[20:12:22] <bengalo> awesome, looks tough at start but its actually just a little puzzling
[20:13:29] <Fernandos> bengalo: an idea why the identical touchend event doesn't even trigger? http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/28/edit
[20:17:10] <gx> bengalo: this is working to "strip" the trailing zeros: r = r.replace(/\.?0+$/, '');
[20:17:11] <gx> but
[20:17:18] <gx> i'm wanting to also find the "opposite" of that
[20:17:22] <gx> any idea? i suck at regex
[20:17:37] <gx> so i want to find any characters prior to that r.replace
[20:17:40] <gx> and make them bold
[20:17:48] <bengalo> Fernandos i dunno if on is chainable
[20:17:49] <gx> i can use 2 regex's and just concatenate them, that's probably the easiest wya
[20:19:21] <gx> if i can somehow find the actual value of what's being replaced, that will work perfect, but i'm not sure how to do that
[20:19:27] <gx> ie, find out the number of zero's
[20:20:15] <bengalo> gx ill take a look soon, not an expert though, but as i said, just a little bit of puzzling ahead
[20:20:25] <gx> oh i think i'd just do a match
[20:20:26] <gx> instead of replace
[20:20:27] <bengalo> you might want to check out greedy
[20:20:56] <bengalo> (charhere+?)
[20:21:03] <bengalo> thats what u want imo
[20:21:10] <bengalo> but lemme check out Fernandos first
[20:21:20] <gx> that was it
[20:21:21] <gx> fixed
[20:21:31] <gx> 2 regex's, one of them replaces, the other one matches
[20:21:34] <gx> then concatenate them.
[20:21:35] <gx> thx!
[20:22:28] <bengalo> good then ;)
[20:25:24] <bengalo> http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/32/edit this is at least throwing no errors but not doing what u want
[20:25:35] <bengalo> maybe u cant stop the animation in the middle of it
[20:30:07] <Fernandos> yes, I think the event touchend is useless here, because each touch will trigger touchstart, even when the arrows are clicked..
[20:30:14] <Fernandos> I could try using the :not selector..
[20:31:38] <bengalo> class="fotorama__img"
[20:32:45] <bengalo> $(.fotorama').on('touchstart', '.fotorama__', function() { ... });
[20:32:54] <bengalo> oops
[20:32:58] <bengalo> $(.fotorama').on('touchstart', '.fotorama__img', function() { ... });
[21:25:00] <Fernandos> hmm
[21:25:00] <Fernandos> awesome, that works!
[21:25:24] <Fernandos> bengalo: finally http://jsbin.com/zimuyuke/35/edit
[21:25:24] <Fernandos> btw. chaining event listeners works
[21:30:25] * araujo wonders if recursive jQuery calls could have some un-expected side-effects
[21:30:48] <araujo> if anybody has some nice link to share about using recursion in jquery calls, I'd appreciate it too :)
[23:32:54] <nahtnam> Hey! I have a input text, and basically people can type in a number. I want to make it so that they cant type anything above 25 and less than 1... I have some regex that stops people from putting text in the box, but I dont know how to stop them from typing things from any number larger than 25
[23:53:52] <Jattenalle> nahtnam, a simple on change javscript should do.. of course you should also verify that in whatever backend you have once the user submits the form
[23:54:31] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: Im not sure what the javascript validation would be... I will definitely check again in the backend,.
[23:54:31] <Jattenalle> nahtnam, just a simple if() should do the trick, no reason to overcomplicate things ;)
[23:54:39] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: Ok.
[23:54:40] <nahtnam> Thanks
[23:54:51] <Jattenalle> if(value<1)value=1; if(value>25)value=25
[23:54:55] <Jattenalle> something like that
[23:55:38] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: Does this look about right? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1384074/limit-input-box-to-0-100
[23:55:53] <Jattenalle> first answer looks good, yeah
[23:56:10] <Jattenalle> there are other ways you could do it, but that's simple, readable and straighforward
[23:56:14] <nahtnam> Ok
