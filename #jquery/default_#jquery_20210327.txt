[08:39:39] <dimi1947> I have installed jquery 3.6 and I use the migrate plugin...and I get many warnings about depr features of jquery 1.12.1...what should I do...go ahead and use 3.6 anyway?
[08:40:08] <dimi1947> the warn about jquery UI 1.12.1 to be more specific...
[08:40:23] <Cork> dimi1947: like i've told you many times, 3.x is NOT an upgrade from 2.x or 1.x it is a different compatibility tree
[08:40:49] <Cork> if you don't need those functions, sure move to 3.x if you need them you shouldn't move compat tree
[08:42:04] <dimi1947> you mean the function for which I get warn?
[08:42:24] <Cork> among other things
[08:42:31] <dimi1947> I see..
[08:42:35] <Cork> 3.x has no ie special work arounds
[08:42:52] <Cork> so old is browser won't work with it
[08:43:24] <dimi1947> so using 2.4...for which I did not get warw is perfectly OK
[08:43:25] <Cork> well that is 2.x, 3.x removed a quite a bit of old deprecated functions
[08:45:07] <Cork> but ya, a very common miss conseption is that 3.6 is "newer and better" then 2.2.4 or that 2.2.4 is newer then 1.12.1
[08:45:22] <dimi1947> I see...
[08:45:23] <Cork> thay are released about at the same time but for different compatibility uses
[08:45:51] <dimi1947> so it is not about "being better"...but being compat
[08:46:22] <Cork> 1.x has ie < 9 support, 2.x does not, 3.x removed a lot of old functions so reduced its code size
[08:46:33] <Cork> that is all those numbers mean
[08:47:17] <dimi1947> now it is clear
[08:48:13] <dimi1947> one last q....
[08:49:13] <dimi1947> since the code works anyway....the warnings are about depr features....I belieeve I COULD use it anyway...3.6 I k mean
[08:49:52] <Cork> dimi1947: if you get the warnings it means something you use depend on the migration lib
[08:50:11] <Cork> so if you stick with 3.6 and remove the migration lib things will break
[08:50:45] <Cork> if those are things you care about, is more then i can tell though
[08:51:05] <Cork> but the compatibility migration function is executed, else you wouldn't get the warning
[08:52:37] <dimi1947> I see...
[08:53:35] <dimi1947> so the migration plugin ensures code will run...which otherwise would break
[08:53:52] <Cork> that is the point of it ya
[08:54:02] <dimi1947> I see...
[08:54:34] <dimi1947> will go for 2.4..it does the jon...needed for jqueryUI
[08:55:00] <dimi1947> ...job
[08:56:11] <dimi1947> what about using migrate plugin in production so as the code not break..is there anything wrong with that?
[08:56:48] <Cork> not really, just that you're not really gaining anything from just sticking to the compatibile version
[08:57:09] <Cork> you can silence warnings in the migration lib
[08:58:44] <Cork> cause the removed function is just added to the jquery-migrate lib and if you need the function jquery-migrate or the older version would have the same version so... why not just use the original jquery version
[08:58:56] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/main/src/jquery/traversing.js#L6
[09:00:13] <dimi1947> so to coclude...
[09:00:31] <dimi1947> better remove the migrate pluggin and just use the version I really need
[09:00:50] <Cork> ya
[09:00:57] <dimi1947> thanks
[09:01:04] <Cork> unless you can update the points that actually devend on the old structure
[09:01:14] <Cork> devend == depend
[09:01:30] <dimi1947> that is a little time consuming...
[09:01:47] <Cork> but keeping migrate around to be able to move further up in version number is not making things better
[09:02:15] <Cork> if anything it will force you to load more code into the page
[09:02:29] <dimi1947> I think it is crystal clear that I should for the version I really need
[09:02:44] <dimi1947> no updates..no migrate plugins
[09:03:06] <Cork> if you can't find compatible plugins, definitely
[09:03:21] <Cork> that is why the different major versions exist
[09:04:43] <dimi1947> hmm...you know it nerver occured to me that dif versions has to do with copatibilty...I though it was just an issue of "better and newer"
[09:05:13] <Cork> y.x.z y=major, x=minor, z=patch
[09:05:18] <Cork> major=breaking chagnes
[09:05:30] <Cork> minor=feature changes but not breaking
[09:05:37] <Cork> patch=fixes nothing change
[09:05:47] <Cork> it is what version numbers is meant to mean :)
[09:06:33] <Cork> what makes jquery a little different is that most other project don't keep developing older major versions when they move to a new one
[09:07:46] <Cork> but the compatibility and codevelopment of the different major versions was stated in the blog when they where developed
[09:08:07] <Cork> (though you should note, jquery is basically dead, same as jquery-ui)
[09:08:40] <dimi1947> what are my alternatives?
[09:08:46] <dimi1947> framewrok?
[09:09:28] <Cork> to move away from jquery, none i would say
[09:09:34] <Cork> isn't really a need for it either
[09:09:43] <Cork> but i wouldn't start a new website with it anymore
[09:10:46] <dimi1947> ok...but I think I can do my job with is ,,,still?
[09:11:15] <Cork> for a website using jquery i wouldn't even consider moving
[09:11:54] <Cork> but the browser compatibility jquery was created for isn't really needed anymore
[09:12:09] <Cork> the browser landscape is completely different to what it was back then
[09:12:53] <dimi1947> what shoud I use to attach listeners and manipulate the  DOM then?
[09:12:59] <Cork> and when i said jquery is dead i mean it haven't had a freature release in line 3 years
[09:13:02] <Uhkis> and there's queryselector and fetch() for writing less
[09:13:10] <Cork> and like 3-4 security fixes
[09:13:26] <Cork> line==like
[09:13:43] <dimi1947> oh...I assume that means that I can still do my job with it...
[09:13:54] <dimi1947> dead but still usefull
[09:13:55] <Cork> when jquery was actually developed it would have had 5-6 feature releases in the same time
[09:14:21] <Cork> definitely
[09:14:37] <Cork> especially to not have to take the project over to keep old sites running
[09:15:47] <Cork> for me fetch was the last big nail for jquery in my book
[09:15:54] <Cork> before that $.ajax was a big help
[09:16:40] <dimi1947> glad to hear it...I do not want to spend time on learning sth new now...I want to ship..it is my progect
[09:17:43] <dimi1947> so I suppose for my next progect I can go to vanilla..for example...but for now I can do my job with jquery
