[00:32:54] <rakl> anyone around?
[01:00:11] <xec> ?ask @ rakl
[01:00:26] <xec> where's bot-t when you need him =(
[01:00:35] <rakl> sorry, got sidetracked…
[01:00:46] <rakl> for some reason my input file button isn't responding to .click() event
[01:00:58] <hekep> how to select all  <A> links from <iframe id="myframe"  ...  $( '#myframe>a' ).attr(  'onclick' , '  return false  ' ); does not work and I need to set window.location to that clicked <a href="location">"
[01:01:07] <rakl> it is firing the click event, but the dialog box to upload files isn't showing u
[01:01:12] <rakl> in chrome
[01:01:24] <WeThePeople> anybody familiar with lightbox2 or a alternative?
[01:01:59] <rakl> no idea why. can't seem to find a spot in my codebase that could be blocking it…
[01:03:09] <xec> rakl: the dialog box you're talking about, do you mean the native browser thing, or is it something custom?
[01:03:20] <rakl> no the native browser thing
[01:03:35] <rakl> it's just a simple <input type="file">click me</input>
[01:03:48] <xec> rakl: can you reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle?
[01:03:53] <rakl> it was working fine this morning, but commits were made
[01:04:29] <rakl> i doubt it haha. i'm sure it works fine in fiddle. I wanted to know if there were any common reasons why it wouldn't be displaying the dialog box
[01:05:06] <xec> not that i know of, unless the click handler returns false, or preventDefault() is called on the event object, or something like that
[01:05:35] <xec> if it works in other browser i'm not sure what it could be tbh
[01:05:44] <xec> browsers*
[01:06:44] <stygyan> guys, i need some quick help, plz
[01:06:53] <xec> hekep: is the iframe contents served from the same domain as the host page?
[01:07:03] <stygyan> http://pastebin.com/i1nkSGqh
[01:07:13] <stygyan> this is what happens when you hover over something.
[01:07:21] <stygyan> what do i need to do to make something happen when you stop hovering?
[01:07:41] <rakl> xec no it's not working in other FF or safari either
[01:10:14] <rakl> on a side note, what's wrong with my syntax here? http://jsfiddle.net/mehulkar/Nnrj8/1/
[01:10:20] <rakl> (coffee script guy :/ )
[01:10:22] <BinaryKitten> stygyan pass a second function
[01:10:32] <BinaryKitten> ?.hover @ stygyan
[01:10:46] * BinaryKitten kicks the bot for not being here
[01:11:35] <BinaryKitten> stygyan http://api.jquery.com/hover/  it's not really a "hover" per say  it's more a mouseEnter, mouseLeave combo
[01:12:14] <BinaryKitten> .hover(fnIn, fnOut)  does .on('mouseEnter', fnIn).on('mouseLeave', fnOut)
[01:12:35] <BinaryKitten> .hover(fn) (how you currently have it) does .on('mouseEnter', fn).on('mouseLeave', fn)
[01:12:56] <BinaryKitten> stygyan: hopefully that answers your question
[01:13:06] <stygyan> yeah, thank you
[01:13:22] <xec> rakl: in the js? nothing that i can see. but <input> is a void element (no closing tag) and you didn't include jquery ;) http://jsfiddle.net/Nnrj8/2/
[01:13:35] <stygyan> i saw the hover page before on jquery, but couldn't find what i needed to do - unless you told me about the function thing
[01:13:38] <rakl> hah that would be it
[01:14:29] <rakl> xec so that's basically hwat i'm doing in my codebase and it's not working :/ let's see if i can comment out all the preventDefault()s
[01:15:23] <stygyan> ok, finished and now i'm on my way to the gym
[01:15:25] <stygyan> see y'all
[01:32:19] <granden> Hi, I'm trying to set a max width of an image using the jquery plugin found here, http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/#
[01:32:24] <granden> anyone know if it is possible?
[01:39:28] <fr4nk> granden: just use a selector to select the image (is it always: lightbox-image !?) and give it css() max width
[01:40:17] <fr4nk> or write it in your css file, if ID of the image is always lightbox-image
[01:40:32] <fr4nk> just try and error :-P
[01:56:37] <aqeel_> btw you can use css max-width
[02:04:28] <Flobin> hi everyone. I have a sliding tabs setup here: -webkit-transition: height 600ms ease;
[02:04:28] <Flobin> -moz-transition: height 600ms ease;
[02:04:28] <Flobin> -ms-transition: height 600ms ease;
[02:04:28] <Flobin> -o-transition: height 600ms ease;
[02:04:28] <Flobin> transition: height 600ms ease;
[02:04:34] <Flobin> frig, wrong ctrl+v
[02:05:02] <Flobin> okay so I have a sliding tab thing here: http://robinberghuijs.com/rcb/
[02:05:29] <Flobin> and I'm wondering what's the best way to get the tab to slide back down if you click pretty much anywhere?
[02:06:39] <Flobin> perhaps I should do it with toggleclass
[02:07:59] <BinaryKitten> // pseudo code  not direct code   $(document).on('click', function(e) { if (e.target != tab) { tab.removeClass('blah'); } });
[02:08:57] <Flobin> ah, right, thanks
[02:11:49] <Flobin> where you typed tab, what would I substitute? the <a>, right? so I'd put $('.tab')
[02:12:21] <lucasw> Hi, i want to use prototype for a single code block on my website, but i dont want to all my jQuery code with the .noConflict(); any tips on how to proceed? (i do need the prototype code)
[02:46:44] <nickSwe> Are we awake World?
[02:57:06] <chris____> Something bizzare is happening in my rails app and I'm pretty sure it's somehow got something to do with the Jquery/javascript, and I'm not sure how to diagnose it.   Basically after a page loads up, another request is made from the browser to the server.  It is always a GET request and there are no parameters.  What's the best way for me to find out how this is happening?
[02:57:32] <chris____> The URL of this GET request is always the same as the page just loaded.
[03:13:42] <Flobin> okay so I think I have to try this again because what I was doing isn't really working. I have these sliding tabs here http://robinberghuijs.com/rcb/
[03:14:01] <Flobin> and what I'd like to do is make them slide back down when you click basically anywhere
[03:14:14] <Flobin> (and also maybe animate them more nicely, but that's another story, I guess)
[03:14:24] <Flobin> so I'm wondering if anyone would know how
[03:15:00] <Flobin> the relevant jquery bit is at http://robinberghuijs.com/rcb/wp-content/themes/RCB/js/jquery.slidingtabs.js
[03:15:05] <Hapzzz> i need a decent script to edit spans in place
[03:15:25] <Hapzzz> i've found Jeditable, but it won't let me trigger the edit with my own method
[03:16:40] <GoSox> will a reload like window.location.reload() work on all browsers?
[03:18:57] <wilornel> GoSox: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp
[03:20:13] <trinadh> Flobin: remove the activeclass on all the remaining tabs when ever a click happens on one tab
[03:20:40] <Flobin> trinadh, why didn't I think of that!
[03:20:42] <Flobin> thank you
[03:24:28] <Flobin> awesome, thank you very much, trinadh!
[03:24:49] <trinadh> Flobin: welcome
[03:25:29] <trinadh> Hapzzz: trigger the edit with own method..?
[03:40:33] <GoSox> So if I have a few form <input>'s, without an actual form (because I do all of the processing in jquery), is there a way i can still "enable" the browser's autofill on those inputs?
[03:40:49] <GoSox> or do i have to force an input in there
[03:40:59] <GoSox> * i mean force a <form>
[03:45:32] <Hapzzz> i need quick aid
[03:45:33] <Hapzzz> http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js
[03:45:35] <Hapzzz> there's this plugin
[03:45:44] <Hapzzz> @trinadh
[03:45:58] <Hapzzz> it will fire up and do what it does on 'click'
[03:46:23] <Hapzzz> i need it to fire up and do it's job for $('.class'), upon a click on something else
[03:46:27] <Hapzzz> i can't find that stuff in the src.
[03:47:16] <monik> ciao
[03:48:03] <monik> list
[03:50:19] <Hapzzz> anyone?
[03:59:23] <coj> does anyone use an infinite scroll script with masonry? how do you handle back button functionality? Because it seems to be broken when I incorporate both. masonry preserves back functionality, but it seems infinite scroll doesn't.
[03:59:27] <krz> how do i round 0.8?
[03:59:45] <AdamPDotty> Math.round(0.8);
[04:03:00] <krz> gracias
[04:03:16] <AdamPDotty> de nada
[04:09:15] <BuriB> hello fellow js coders. I've a problem for I'd like get some advice.
[04:09:53] <samuel02> BuriB, ?
[04:10:12] <BuriB> I'm working on a big site where there are ajax call across different parts with different DataTypes. xml, json, json, html, etc
[04:11:19] <BuriB> I'd need to set up a data prefilter on the ajax data that has been returned.
[04:11:58] <BuriB> check for certain conditions and parse the data
[04:12:29] <BuriB> for this reason I've set up ajaxPrefilter with some converter like so:
[04:15:55] <BuriB> http://jsfiddle.net/eR38u/
[04:16:09] <BuriB> the thing I'd like to achive is:
[04:17:46] <BuriB> 1. check for condtion in response data. 2. if condition is true, run a function. 3. return the data according to the original dataType. ( client side might expect different format then it the returned one )
[04:17:53] <BuriB> does it make sense?
[04:17:57] <Hapzzz> i'm becoming insane.
[04:18:09] <Hapzzz>             $(this).bind(settings.event, function(e) {
[04:18:17] <Hapzzz> i can trigger that from elsewhere with .trigger()
[04:18:31] <Hapzzz> how can i cancel the first bind
[04:18:34] <Hapzzz> and still have trigger
[04:21:48] <Qiller> hi, have any plugin to align a div to center forever automatically when i use scroll ?
[04:22:12] <BuriB> http://jsfiddle.net/eR38u/2/ updated.
[04:22:16] <Qiller> move top, bot, left, right automatically div on center 4 ever
[04:22:41] <sriyani> hi, i have a table, when i click th i want to sort its column data, how can i do that?
[04:27:45] <BuriB> anyone? question is in the comments.
[04:27:46] <BuriB> http://jsfiddle.net/eR38u/2/
[04:32:45] <Hapzzz> cmon people
[04:32:47] <Hapzzz> it's a simple one
[04:32:48] <Hapzzz> i'm dying
[04:34:46] <BuriB> Happz, what's your question once more? can u provide a jsfiddle link or something?
[04:36:27] <seutje> ?unbind @ Hapzzz
[04:38:15] <xec> Hapzzz: sounds like an X/Y issue - if you unbind you can't trigger it anymore... what are you really trying to achieve? what's your use case?
[04:39:43] <xec> Hapzzz: The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that, either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
[04:40:09] <AdamPDotty> who unbound Hapz?
[04:42:12] <Hapzzz> xec http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js
[04:42:14] <Hapzzz> this plugin.
[04:42:21] <Hapzzz> (and every other similar one i've seen)
[04:42:29] <Hapzzz> it will trigger when the text field is clicked
[04:42:46] <Hapzzz> i need a click on something else to trigger the process
[04:42:56] <Hapzzz> a click on the text has a whole other purpose
[04:43:08] <Hapzzz> i've spent mere 3 hours on this
[04:48:31] <Hapzzz> xec?
[04:53:56] <AQEEL> hi channel
[05:03:38] <xec> Hapzzz: i'm sorry, was afk there a bit. I haven't used (or seen) jeditable before, but i'm sure someone will have a look if you're able to make a live demo with some code. are you familiar with jsfiddle?
[05:05:45] <anew> http://pastebin.com/eeuSGppa anyone see anything wrongn with this ajax call?
[05:06:51] <xec> anew: yep, you're missing quotes around GET
[05:07:27] <BuriB> http://jsfiddle.net/eR38u/2/ anyone has some info about this one? :)
[05:07:34] <xec> anew: checking console for errors should have told you that ?
[05:07:58] <anew> oh doh... i have console set to logs right now instead of all or errors
[05:08:05] <anew> thx xec
[05:08:34] <anew> trying to finish this ajax before the end of the world tonight
[05:08:50] <xec> which begs the question: why?
[05:09:10] <xec> i mean, everything seizes to exist, but at least you got the project done? :D
[05:09:38] <anew> dunno, i just cant leave things unfinished.  would like to complete it before the world implodes
[05:09:46] <anew> lol
[05:10:56] <xec> BuriB: are you able to inspect the http request?
[05:11:37] <syntax> hi@all. question: i want to check a url var like this one &var=value and want to hide an div with a id called "zrg3" if the var isset. this should be done on document ready. with an slide up effect. how get i rid of this?
[05:12:18] <BuriB> yes, I am. response is good. jsfiddle link is just calling for a dummy url.
[05:12:27] <BuriB> works well in local.
[05:14:08] <BuriB> my task is: except any format, filter data, do something, return the data in the expected format.
[05:14:19] <BuriB> was able to do this with converters
[05:14:51] <BuriB> but for some reason the data is not available in the success callback.
[05:15:00] <seutje> syntax: window.location.search, but that contains the entire query string, including the initial questionmark (I think)
[05:15:13] <seutje> syntax: so u might wanna look for a library that does the parsing for u
[05:15:40] <anew> data: 'username='+ $('#username').val(), is this 'ok' to write? or is it stupid
[05:18:39] <xec> BuriB: i'm not sure i follow. by "except" do you mean "accept"?
[05:18:47] <seutje> anew: for an ajax request? isn't the data param automagically serialized?
[05:19:07] <BuriB> xes. sry, ohh yes.
[05:19:22] <xec> and by "xes" do you mean "xec"? :D
[05:19:39] <BuriB> :D:D yes, sry. :)
[05:19:42] <anew> seutje i dont understand what you mean ?
[05:20:14] <xec> hehe, anyway, what do you get in the response body of the http request?
[05:20:36] <BuriB> getting a json
[05:20:58] <syntax> seutje : hm
[05:21:31] <BuriB> { hasReportableData: true, originalContent: "someXmlString" }
[05:22:02] <seutje> anew: if this data is the data parameter for an ajax call, you can just pass an object and won't need to do the awkward concetenation (yourself)
[05:22:37] <BuriB> so I'd like to get out the origalContent properties value, parse it as XML and return, so instead of json there will be an xml dataType returned.
[05:22:40] <BuriB> does it make sense?
[05:23:24] <xec> BuriB: keys should be quoted in json, but otherwise fine. do you see a "Content-Type" http header? what is it set to?
[05:23:30] <seutje> anew: like var myData = {username: $('#username').val()}; $.ajax({data: myData});
[05:24:15] <BuriB> yeah, I know about the quotes, just cause of quick chatting :)
[05:24:32] <tapas> hi, i stumbled over this function: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[05:24:45] <tapas> how difficult would it be to adapt it to an approximate string search?
[05:25:04] <anew> hmmm no i dont have it set up that way, is it better ?
[05:25:18] <BuriB> response is Content-Type:text/html
[05:25:21] <syntax> anew : there is nothin to extract a var like this?
[05:25:28] <seutje> anew: I find it easier than concatting the strings myself
[05:25:51] <anew> well yep i will use that way then thanks
[05:27:02] <tapas> how would i go about finding the source for that functionality?
[05:27:45] <xec> BuriB: ok then i see two issues - your $.ajax() call is expecting XML (remove the dataType option to set it to the default, which is 'intelligent guess' and should handle json fine) - and secondly, i believe you need the Content-Type to be set to "application/json"
[05:28:16] <syntax> anew : var searchString = window.location.search.substring(1)
[05:29:34] <syntax> anew: perhaps i use this one: http://www.mathias-bank.de/2007/04/21/jquery-plugin-geturlparam-version-2/
[05:30:16] <BuriB> xec: 1. can't really do that, because it's expecting XML for a reason. working on a large codebase.
[05:30:38] <BuriB> the problem is not that it's not handling the data fine, but not even getting it after using the $ converters.
[05:30:56] <anew> syntax if i use var instead of the GET query do i need that ?
[05:31:14] <xec> BuriB: i thought your goal was to accept multiple formats?
[05:32:00] <BuriB> no, the real goal here is to convert to the format what's it accepting.
[05:32:42] <syntax> anew : hm, help me?
[05:33:03] <BuriB> accept xml -> response is json -> do some stuff with json data -> parse data in the xml format -> let success cb handle the rest with the xml data.
[05:33:04] <anew> well just trying to figure out what u sent i'm a total noob lol
[05:34:03] <xec> BuriB: if you set it to only accept xml and you receive json, i doubt you're going to get it to work
[05:34:34] <xec> BuriB: what exactly do you mean by "parse data in xml format" btw
[05:35:07] <BuriB> but if the json is containing the data in xml string then I can parse that with parseXML.
[05:35:28] <xec> :/
[05:35:33] <xec> you lost me. where is the xml?
[05:36:11] <BuriB> in certain cases the xml response has been wrapped into json
[05:36:29] <BuriB> ahh :) wait. let me explain in pm.
[05:37:37] <anew> http://pastebin.com/pyFyQc5F
[05:37:49] <anew> this is the response i'm getting, but is this if statment correct?
[05:37:59] <anew> i'm getting succes, but just not going thru this if statment

[06:30:12] <xec> that's right - the sledgehammer way, just litter some slashes about

[06:30:36] <VinSpee> indeed sledgehammery :-)

[06:34:18] <Joeytje50> hey, how can I delete a tag's data-attributes?
[06:34:43] <Joeytje50> the ones set by JQuery's .data('foo','bar'
[06:34:48] <Joeytje50> the ones set by JQuery's .data('foo','bar') *
[06:35:21] <VinSpee> $("tag").data("foo", "")
[06:35:25] <xec> Joeytje50: .data() doesn't set data-* attributes
[06:35:46] <Joeytje50> VinSpee: that's blanking them
[06:35:58] <VinSpee> oh you actually want it gone
[06:35:59] <Joeytje50> I need to delete all those values from $(tag).data()
[06:36:02] <Joeytje50> yea
[06:36:37] <xec> ?removedata @ Joeytje50
[06:36:38] <bot-t> Joeytje50, .removeData([name]): Remove a previously-stored piece of data. http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[06:37:03] <VinSpee> $("tag").removeAttr("data-foo");
[06:37:45] <xec> yeah, if you want to remove an attribute, use what VinSpee says. if you want to remove something set by .data(), use what bot-t says
[06:38:09] <Joeytje50> okay
[06:38:34] <Joeytje50> also, a tag with a data-foo attribute has a data-foo value in the $(tag).data() automatically too right?
[06:38:37] <VinSpee> xec: As of jQuery 1.4.3 HTML 5 data- attributes will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object. The treatment of attributes with embedded dashes was changed in jQuery 1.6 to conform to the W3C HTML5 specification.
[06:38:52] <xec> Joeytje50: correct, but that's a one-time one-way read
[06:38:58] <Joeytje50> okay
[06:39:41] <xec> like the "pulled in" part from VinSpee's paste implies
[06:40:00] <VinSpee> yep
[06:40:41] <Joeytje50> btw, is there something in JQuery that can get a list of the existing .data() values?
[06:40:50] <Joeytje50> in the form of an array
[06:41:29] <rmill> You could use .map
[06:41:35] <Joeytje50> ?map
[06:41:36] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[06:43:05] <rmill> Joeytje50: something like this → http://jsfiddle.net/serio/vMpWd/
[06:43:55] <Joeytje50> oh, I meant like getting all data from 1 tag
[06:44:13] <xec> Joeytje50: just calling .data() without arguments returns an object (aka hashmap) of all the pieces of data stored
[06:44:21] <rmill> ya
[06:44:39] <rmill> it'll get a `list` by default
[06:44:54] <Joeytje50> I mean, a list of the attributes' names
[06:45:27] <Joeytje50> so {'a':2,'b':3} would be ['a','b']
[06:45:53] <xec> Joeytje50: you could do Object.keys()
[06:46:06] <xec> Joeytje50: http://jsfiddle.net/vMpWd/2/
[06:46:14] <xec> but why do you want that?
[06:46:56] <xec> actually, console.log() demonstrates arrays better ;) http://jsfiddle.net/vMpWd/3/
[06:47:47] <Joeytje50> xec: I want to do $(tag).removeData($(tag).data().keys())
[06:47:54] <Joeytje50> I want to remove all data in the tag
[06:48:05] <xec> Joeytje50: why
[06:50:07] <xec> (just sounds like an odd thing to do)
[06:50:11] <danheberden> Joeytje50: you can just call removeData()
[06:50:21] <danheberden> no args means it clears everything
[06:50:43] <Joeytje50> xec: it's basically like this: I want to "move" a tag to another place, so what I've done is copy over the class attribute, the html, and the data, and then I clear those things from the original
[06:50:57] <Joeytje50> I want to make something walk over a grid, and the grid is a <table>
[06:50:58] <xec> danheberden: yeah but it will still pull in data-* attributes after the fact http://jsfiddle.net/aq6rb/1/
[06:51:17] <danheberden> oh, eww, didn't see the application
[06:52:57] <xec> Joeytje50: i'm not sure why you would "move" by copying rather than just move it
[06:53:13] <Joeytje50> I need to basically move an element
[06:53:20] <Joeytje50> how could I do that then?
[06:53:47] <Joeytje50> I have <table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>X</td><td></td></tr></table>
[06:53:55] <Joeytje50> I want to move the X to the first <td>
[06:53:55] <xec> Joeytje50: you could use .append() or appendTo() (depending on what you call it on)
[06:54:10] <danheberden> or html() or before() or after() or ...
[06:54:18] <danheberden> ?manipulation @ Joeytje50
[06:54:18] <bot-t> Joeytje50, Docs: Manipulation - All of the methods in this chapter manipulate the DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element (also listed in the Attributes category ), while others set an ... http://api.jquery.com/category/Manipulation/
[06:54:37] <Joeytje50> I know about all those
[06:54:47] <xec> you just don't like them? :)
[06:54:55] <danheberden> they why did you ask "how could i do that then?"
[06:54:57] <rmill> :>
[06:55:09] <Joeytje50> but that doesn't actually take the 3rd td, put it in the 1st td's place, and put the 1st td in the 3rd td's place
[06:55:21] <danheberden> Joeytje50: well obviously you have to do SOME work
[06:55:35] <Joeytje50> such as just copying the stuff over
[06:56:36] <saltcod> I can select multiple selectors like this:  $('.content, .nav, .sidebar').hide(), but why can't I do the same when I've cached them?  ie:  $(content, nav, sidebar).hide()
[06:56:57] <rmill> um
[06:57:12] <danheberden> Joeytje50: just put the 1st td's content somewhere (empty div off dom), put the 3rd td's stuff in the 1st one, and put the 1sts (in the div off dom) back into the 3rd
[06:57:20] <danheberden> just move the shit around using .html() or whatever
[06:57:27] <xec> saltcod: the comma only works in (css) selectors
[06:57:30] <danheberden> or grab the children()
[06:57:38] <Joeytje50> instead of getting the 1st td, then getting the exact location of the 3rd td, then inserting it, then getting the 3rd td, getting the exact position of the 1st td, inserting it there, then deleting them both from the original location
[06:57:40] <danheberden> i'm sure you'll figure it out - but you might as well just move that shit
[06:57:50] <rmill> or cash all the things!
[06:57:53] <Joeytje50> danheberden: that's EXACTLY what I'm doing
[06:57:53] <rmill> *cache
[06:58:04] <danheberden> Joeytje50: but you said copying and deleting
[06:58:13] <xec> saltcod: if you want to merge cached collections, you can see ?add
[06:58:14] <bot-t> saltcod, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[06:58:35] <danheberden> if i do var $tmp = $('<div>').html( $td1.children() );
[06:58:41] <danheberden> the contents of $td1 are MOVED to that div
[06:59:00] <danheberden> and if i do $td1.html( $td3.children() )
[06:59:08] <xec> Joeytje50: clearly it's not EXACTLY what you're doing, because then you wouldn't be trying to remove data-* attributes
[06:59:09] <danheberden> the contents of td3 are moved to td1
[06:59:11] <Joeytje50> danheberden: what I said is copying over the .html(), .attr('class') and .data(), to the 1st td, then .html('').removeAttr('class') the 3rd td, and blank the data
[06:59:18] <danheberden> dno't copy html()
[06:59:29] <danheberden> just MOVE the dom node using html( THENODEHERE )
[06:59:40] <danheberden> not getting the actual "html" or "markup"
[06:59:57] <Joeytje50> that would be .replaceWith(NODEHERE) then
[06:59:59] <saltcod> xec: gotcha. Thanks!  Seems like it would be much handier to just let me use the comma  =)
[07:00:09] <computer2000> pls help, im new to require.js and trying to load in new js files as soon as all required files are loaded: http://pastebin.com/8ZHk51Jr am i doing it right? if yes, how do i now load in new js files?
[07:00:20] <danheberden> Joeytje50: if you're so hell bent on knowing what to do, i'll bow out
[07:00:23] <danheberden> good luck bro!

[07:01:00] <xec> ?glwtd @ Joeytje50
[07:01:00] <bot-t> Joeytje50, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[07:01:10] <Joeytje50> danheberden: I don't want to put the 3rd td in the 1st td
[07:01:13] <Joeytje50> I want to move it
[07:01:37] <danheberden> then move it - i'm just giving example
[07:01:43] <danheberden> you can always move the td inside the row
[07:02:20] <danheberden> $td1.before( $td3 ); $td2.before( $td1 ); would flip 1 and 3
[07:03:22] <Joeytje50> huh
[07:03:53] <danheberden> obviously assuming $td1 is $('.theRowYouWant td').eq(0) or whatever
[07:03:56] <danheberden> etc
[07:05:46] <Joeytje50> http://jsfiddle.net/nguqK/
[07:06:38] <danheberden> Joeytje50: you have to do it in the context of the row, obvs
[07:06:46] <danheberden> sigh, one sec
[07:08:33] <syntax> how do i access an id like this "FORM[doform101][el_38]" !?!
[07:10:39] <Joeytje50> syntax: $('form#doform101').find('input').eq(38); gets the 38th <input>, if that's what you mean
[07:10:54] <xec> syntax: $('[id="FORM[doform101][el_38]"]') should work
[07:11:23] <shoky> would that use document.getElementById tho
[07:11:24] <syntax> thx i try both
[07:11:45] <xec> shoky: nope
[07:11:57] <shoky> well it should!
[07:12:04] <Joeytje50> syntax: my code would get the 38th input, xec's code would get the form with id="FORM[doform101][el_38]"
[07:12:07] <xec> shoky: but with IDs like that, selector performance would't be the first thing i'd fix ;)
[07:12:23] <Joeytje50> if both are not what you meant, you should explain what you mean
[07:12:24] <shoky> ;p
[07:12:51] <xec> shoky: actually, it would be, because i would fix the ID :P
[07:13:03] <syntax> no it fire's
[07:13:05] <syntax> thx
[07:13:21] <danheberden> Joeytje50: http://jsfiddle.net/nguqK/2/
[07:13:22] <shoky> heh
[07:13:38] <danheberden> that might help explain
[07:14:08] <xec> syntax: $(document.getElementById("FORM[doform101][el_38]") would also work, and be slightly better performance-wise
[07:14:17] <danheberden> if you wanted to just move the *contents* of a column, i'd move the children() - but you, i'm sure, get the idea
[07:14:28] <shoky> you can also just escape it
[07:14:35] <danheberden> and .eq(38) woudl get the 39th element, btw
[07:15:27] <xec> shoky: i thought so too, but i couldnt get it working
[07:15:29] <syntax> xec : ok thx
[07:15:50] <xec> syntax: of course, the irony is that there is a syntax error in my last code snippet
[07:16:13] <xec> syntax: there should be another ) on the end ;)
[07:16:51] <xec> shoky: see? http://jsfiddle.net/TmmXN/
[07:17:04] <shoky> xec: double backslashes
[07:17:08] <xec> ack
[07:17:12] <shoky> ?eval "\["
[07:17:13] <bot-t> shoky: "["
[07:17:37] <xec> i guess it gets parsed twice or something?
[07:17:56] <shoky> if you want a backslash in your string
[07:18:05] <shoky> then your string literal needs two
[07:18:12] <shoky> ?eval "\\"
[07:18:12] <bot-t> shoky: "\"
[07:18:27] <xec> right. of course.
[07:18:58] <shoky> and it also gets parsed twice, yes ;p
[07:19:27] <xec> $("#FORM\\[doform101\\]\\[el_38\\]") looks hella ugly though
[07:20:38] <shoky> well.. dont stick it near any clean code then
[07:20:45] <danheberden> well using id's like that, let alone id's formatted like that, is ugly
[07:20:56] <xec> indeed

[08:12:35] <hateIE> $("td .glowingsign2.ui-selectee").removeClass("glowingsign2");  .. how comes that does not remove the cass ?
[08:13:04] <hateIE> class even..
[08:14:44] <BillCriswell> hateIE: It does. I'm thinking there's something else up with your code.
[08:15:04] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you want ui-selectee and not ui-selected ?
[08:15:15] <hateIE> yeah its defo ui-selectee
[08:15:27] <jeffsmykil> Noob question: I have a very simple HAML template with a select in it, I would like to populate the select with options based off of rows in an sqlite database if I do something like @categories = DB[:categories].filter(live:true).order(:posted_on.desc).all haml:index how do I get to that code from the HAML template?
[08:15:35] <jeffsmykil> wrong channel
[08:15:36] <jeffsmykil> GRAG
[08:15:42] <BillCriswell> hateIE: Are these classnames on the td or on a child of it?
[08:16:43] <NoiseEee> hateIE: simple debugging would help.  as BillCriswell asks, is your selector even what you want it to be?  log it to console.  is it returning what you are expecting?
[08:16:57] <BillCriswell> Your code would remove 'glowingsign2' on the span inside <td> <span class="glowingsign2 ui-selectee">Hi</span></td>
[08:17:10] <BillCriswell> or on any element, just using span here.
[08:17:35] <BillCriswell> I'm assuming you want td.glowingsign2.ui-selectee
[08:18:32] <hateBT> sorry i might of missed a a line or two.. my inet provider is total garbage
[08:18:56] <NoiseEee> hateBT: simple debugging would help.  as BillCriswell asks, is your selector even what you want it to be?  log it to console.  is it returning what you are expecting?
[08:19:33] <BillCriswell> You're targeting child elements of every <td> with your selector.
[08:20:38] <BillCriswell> If you want to select all tds with those classes ON them you would do td.selector1.selector2
[08:21:27] <cboyden> Not sure if anyone is interested, but JetBRAINS is having a great deal on their IDEs, including WebStorm: http://goo.gl/t6DbP
[08:23:47] <NoiseEee> thanks cboyden!
[08:23:48] <NoiseEee> crazy
[08:24:10] <hateIE> heh BT does not want me to get help evidently
[08:24:40] <NoiseEee> hateIE: simple debugging would help.  as BillCriswell asks, is your selector even what you want it to be?  log it to console.  is it returning what you are expecting?

[08:25:25] <stultus> hi while loading jquery v1.8.2  to a ff extension I am getting this error : TypeError: a is undefined
[08:25:30] <stultus> any ideas ?
[08:25:36] <hateIE> and will sound like something EEE at the end phoneticaly
[08:26:00] <cboyden> Glad I can finally contribute to this channel :P
[08:26:31] <hateIE> yeah so any way bill mentioned that the sector will target child elements
[08:26:35] <hateIE> thats not what i want
[08:26:41] <hateIE> i want to target the td itself
[08:26:56] <NoiseEee> hateIE: so do it.  i'm sure you can figure it out. its basic selector syntax.
[08:27:08] <NoiseEee> hateIE: really, all of this is capable of solving in moments if you just try debugging yourself.
[08:27:42] <hateIE> thing is the td has no id
[08:27:55] <NoiseEee> hateIE: its irrelevant, you know the classes you want.
[08:28:05] <BillCriswell> hateIE: I told you in 10 different ways
[08:28:31] <hateIE> you told dev null.. mate did you not see my inet go flakey
[08:28:47] <BillCriswell> No.
[08:28:59] <BillCriswell> td.classOne.classTwo
[08:29:03] <hateIE> i thought thats what td .classname would target the TD what else do i call it ?
[08:29:11] <BillCriswell> NO SPACE.
[08:29:31] <hateIE> o
[08:30:19] <BillCriswell> The space means you're selected children of the td.
[08:30:41] <BillCriswell> selecting*
[08:31:19] <hateIE> tnx
[08:31:25] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:31:29] <hateIE> yup i understand now
[08:31:36] <BillCriswell> Sweet. That's all that matters.
[08:40:21] <stultus> :(
[08:40:32] <maxetime> Can anyone tell me why an appendto() in a function would work only if there is some kind of delay (ajax, setTimeout, etc.) before (even a 1 milisecond delay)?
[08:45:17] <Aero`> Hi guys. Anyone would have a minute to look at an AJAX form problem ?
[08:46:22] <AdamPDotty> maxetime: page has to load first?
[08:46:56] <maxetime> AdamPDotty: It is loaded as the function is called with $(el).click()
[08:47:39] <danheberden> Aero`: you'll have better luck just asking your question in the most distilled/simplest way possible. If you can make a small example of the problem on jsfiddle.com or something, that'd be awesome
[08:49:19] <Aero`> @danheberden : Thanks ;)
[08:49:54] <Aero`> So I got a "add news" form : http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/admin/index.php?page=news-fr (check out the "nouvelle actualité" blue button on bottom right). It's a simple form sent through AJAX. But I don't know why, it is sent as a regular form, the AJAX code doesn't work
[08:50:02] <Aero`> but I'm 100% sure the syntax is correct
[08:51:46] <Aero`> Actually I found out that if I disable jqBootstrapValidation plugin, the form is sent OK
[08:51:54] <Aero`> I don't know where the problem is
[08:53:02] <danheberden> you'll need the validation plugin to run first - i would hook into that instead of binding directly to submit
[08:53:16] <danheberden> i'm sure the docs have a way to add a submit handler when things are validated
[08:53:25] <danheberden> so that you can THEN preventDefault() the form event and do your ajax stuff
[08:55:12] <Aero`> Mmh the validation stuff runs first in my code
[08:56:37] <Aero`> The problem is a bit more complex than what I first thought
[08:56:49] <Aero`> I got two forms, one for editing news and a second one to add a news
[08:57:07] <Aero`> If I disable the validation thing, the editing form works but not the add form
[08:57:22] <Aero`> and If I enable it, then the editing goes fubar but the add news form works
[09:02:29] <Aero`> @danheberden: Could you elaborate a bit on that submit stuff ?
[09:03:05] <Aero`> I'm a bit confused since the validation plugin actually runs first on my page
[09:03:33] <BillCriswell> I can't believe this server isn't sending a css file as text/css.
[09:07:33] <BillCriswell> My two options css quirks mode or $.get('styles.css', function(css){ $('head').append('<style>' + css + '</style>'); });
[09:07:42] <BillCriswell> Both blow.
[09:08:09] <BillCriswell> My two options are*
[09:08:46] <Aero`> Problem solved thanks to maxetime :) ! Thanks :)
[09:13:32] <fabioportieri> hi
[09:14:06] <fabioportieri> can't figure it out what's wrong here http://pastie.org/5558024, colorbox display nothing, a little empty box
[09:15:58] <fabioportieri> any help is appreciated, i'm pretty tired :p
[09:19:09] <fabioportieri> nothing?
[09:21:12] <verysoftoiletppr> hi, my page reports the $(window).height() always equal to $(document).height() no matter what the actual window height is
[09:27:37] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: Any errors in the console?
[09:27:58] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: nop
[09:33:37] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: Have it up anywhere accessible?
[09:33:54] <fabioportieri> no i haven't..
[09:34:02] <fabioportieri> and i have to go too.. damn
[09:36:57] <Horriblist> o/
[09:41:09] <friedbyte> is there a way to use .load() to load some code to the bottom of the <head> element in a page?
[09:41:59] <Horriblist> sure
[09:42:33] <Horriblist> but dotn you just append
[09:43:00] <Horriblist> i have only done loading scritps manually
[09:43:11] <Horriblist> w out jquert
[09:44:28] <friedbyte> I want to load an external file to the bottom of the <head> . . .
[09:45:05] <friedbyte> so would that be? $('head').append().load('some.txt');
[09:46:22] <Jon47> friedbyte: i think you would need to specify something to append.. like a tag name or element or something
[09:46:45] <friedbyte> there won't be any tag names or class in the <head>
[09:48:01] <Horriblist> yes
[09:48:11] <Horriblist> but i am not sure what load does
[09:48:48] <Horriblist> but the idea is basicly to appent the script tags with a link to file
[09:48:58] <Horriblist> you can do css js etc
[09:49:04] <maxetime> friedbyte: you might want to make an ajax and append each element one by one
[09:49:50] <Horriblist> and obviously you can only use the code from th eloaded files dynammicaly afterwards
[09:50:25] <friedbyte> hmmm
[09:50:42] <maxetime> you could also use load on a temp element and then append the element's html to head
[09:50:49] <friedbyte> append won't load an external file will it?
[09:51:58] <Horriblist> friedbyte: yes it will
[09:52:19] <Horriblist> dont over complicate it
[09:52:33] <Horriblist> the "script" tags
[09:52:37] <Horriblist> is what loads the file
[09:52:43] <friedbyte> $('head').append('some.text');
[09:53:19] <friedbyte> that appends the text some.text instead of the file some.text
[09:53:33] <Horriblist> dood
[09:53:44] <Horriblist> <script src=
[09:53:46] <Horriblist> wtf
[09:53:48] <Horriblist> duuuuuuuuuuur
[09:53:53] <friedbyte> can't do that
[09:54:10] <friedbyte> I'm trying to work around <base>
[09:54:13] <friedbyte> if you must know
[09:54:29] <Horriblist> script = document.createElement('script');
[09:54:40] <Horriblist> script.setAttribute("type","text/javascript");
[09:54:48] <Horriblist> script.setAttribute("src", file);
[09:55:07] <Horriblist> head.appendChild(script);
[09:55:22] <Horriblist> im sure jquery has something for this
[09:55:40] <Horriblist> but thats how you do it w javascript
[09:55:59] <Horriblist> you fuunny
[09:57:16] <maxetime> try something like this var temp = $('<div></div>').load('some.txt'); $('head').append(temp.html()); temp.remove();
[09:57:41] <Horriblist> maxetime: that wont work lol
[09:57:57] <Horriblist> oh wait that uses .load
[09:58:00] <maxetime> Horriblist: why wouldn't it?
[09:58:08] <Horriblist> i dont know .load sory
[09:58:23] <AQEEL> http://code.google.com/p/thin-php-framework/wiki/HowToLoadJSCSSDynamically
[09:58:43] <Horriblist> i was helping him ot load the standard js way
[09:58:45] <maxetime> .load is like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[09:58:46] <b-ot> maxetime, memorised “load”.
[10:00:30] <MalMen> i am filling a table with data (<tr>) is any sooth way to append the tr to the table ?
[10:00:38] <MalMen> like slidedown or something
[10:01:08] <MalMen> i tryed $("#tickets-table").find("tr:gt(1)").slideDown(1000); but dont work sommothly
[10:01:13] <AQEEL> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[10:03:33] <AQEEL> http://headjs.com/
[10:06:11] <AQEEL> so now you can load your js in head
[10:10:44] <wicchan> if i have a function like$.fn.someFunc = function() { $(document).on('click', $(this), function() { ... }); };
[10:11:05] <wicchan> cause i want to replicate the live event inside a function that i have extended from jquery's prototype
[10:11:14] <wicchan> is there any possible way to reference the selector?
[10:11:36] <wicchan> cause the $(this) in the second parameter of on doesn't work and i believe takes only a string parameter that represents a selector
[10:11:55] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, you mean the selector passed to your method?
[10:12:14] <wicchan> hmm
[10:12:19] <wicchan> not sure what you mean by that
[10:12:30] <wicchan> but let me try to clarify since my question was kind of misplaced in my example lol
[10:12:45] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, like this
[10:12:48] <wicchan> like if iw anted to bind say $('a.someClass').someFunc();
[10:12:53] <MistuhKurtz> $(el).someFunc();
[10:12:55] <MistuhKurtz> you want access to el
[10:12:57] <wicchan> yea!
[10:13:00] <wicchan> yep yep!
[10:13:18] <MistuhKurtz> ?plugin+authoring @ wicchan
[10:13:19] <bot-t> wicchan, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery Wiki - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:13:25] <wicchan> but the selector passed to it
[10:13:41] <wicchan> cause i want to do the binding like a .live using on inside the plugin
[10:13:45] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, "this" (no $) refers to your jQuery collection
[10:13:54] <wicchan> right
[10:14:04] <wicchan> how do i pass that binded selector to the on method's second param
[10:14:13] <scar> is node.js a server-wide thing? what if i have 50 domains on 1 server... do all domains tap into the same node.js? I just don't want the port opened for every domain on the site, and dont want to have to reference the IP or another domain to make a connection
[10:14:30] <wicchan> $(document).on('click', <what_goes_here>, function() { ... });
[10:14:37] <wicchan> inside of the plugin
[10:14:49] <wicchan> i could do $(this).live(...)
[10:14:57] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, write up a jsfiddle
[10:14:59] <wicchan> but since its deprecated; i want to use on
[10:15:01] <wicchan> ok
[10:15:05] <scar> nvm
[10:16:54] <MistuhKurtz> first of all wicchan, your element needs to already exist to be able to call a method on it, so I'm not so sure using live or event delegation in this way is absolutely necessary..
[10:17:06] <wicchan> http://jsfiddle.net/yVasc/
[10:17:07] <MistuhKurtz> but let's still follow through with the exercise because your question is a separate matter
[10:17:22] <wicchan> something like that
[10:17:26] <wicchan> a trivial example
[10:18:29] <wicchan> like in <what_goes_here> i tried putting this and $(this)
[10:18:43] <wicchan> but i believe it takes a string representation of a selector
[10:20:10] <wicchan> anyway i updated the fiddle to show what i am trying to achieve here http://jsfiddle.net/yVasc/1/
[10:20:34] <Saaether> wicchan http://jsfiddle.net/yVasc/2/
[10:21:03] <wicchan> oh sorry :p
[10:21:18] <wicchan> yea that works better thanks Saaether
[10:21:59] <wicchan> anyway updated again with a comment on what i am trying to acheive http://jsfiddle.net/yVasc/3/
[10:22:01] <wicchan> haha
[10:22:18] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, http://jsfiddle.net/yVasc/5/
[10:22:59] <Wolf_22> If a variable is nothing more than a boolean value, the comparison operation doesn't need an equals sign, right? (I.e. - if($.cookie('foobar'))... instead of if($.cookie('foobar') == true)...)
[10:23:18] <wicchan> MistuhKurtz, thanks! let me test that out
[10:23:29] <wicchan> though i think i tried this already as the second param
[10:23:44] <MistuhKurtz> wicchan, it works.
[10:24:10] <wicchan> i guess i might have not cleared my cache then
[10:24:45] <MistuhKurtz> but I changed it up a bit
[10:24:57] <MistuhKurtz> because I'm iterating over your collection and returning it
[10:25:13] <wicchan> any reason why you're looping through each eleemnt though?
[10:25:25] <wicchan> doesn't jquery do that by default if you're event binding?
[10:25:44] <MistuhKurtz> that's standard for plugin authoring
[10:25:51] <wicchan> ahh i see
[10:25:53] <wicchan> ok
[10:25:58] <MistuhKurtz> it returns your jquery collection so you can chain more methods onto it
[10:26:02] <MistuhKurtz> like the class that I add
[10:26:12] <wicchan> right
[10:26:14] <wicchan> ok
[10:26:15] <MistuhKurtz> read the plugin authoring link I sent you

[10:26:27] <foo> $(window).width()
[10:26:30] <wicchan> right i understand plugin authoring and returning the element
[10:26:33] <foo> How do I do an alert() with that value?
[10:26:56] <wicchan> but is it also standard to loop through elements that have been selected already in jquery?
[10:27:12] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[10:27:14] <wicchan> ok
[10:27:16] <wicchan> cool
[10:27:18] <wicchan> thanks

[10:27:21] <MistuhKurtz> read the link
[10:27:22] <MistuhKurtz> lol.
[10:27:25] <MistuhKurtz> it explains why.
[10:27:26] <wicchan> oh
[10:27:30] <wicchan> it has standards there too?
[10:27:31] <wicchan> kk
[10:27:33] <wicchan> thanks thanks
[10:27:50] <MistuhKurtz> it's a quick summary of standard best practices for plugin authoring, yes
[10:27:50] <wicchan> ahh i see it
[10:27:52] <wicchan> thanks a lot

[10:38:55] <madsara> Hey, anyone here know how I can call a function by string inside the scope of a $(document).ready()? Outside of that scope I can do it via "var fn = window[myString];", I'd prefer to not use an eval.
[10:39:01] <MACscr> Any suggestions for making this table row toggle smoother and also so that when another one is toggle point is clicked on, the other one prior one closes when this one is opened? http://jsfiddle.net/MDhGc/
[10:39:42] <johnkpaul> madsara: you can use var fn=window[myString] inside document.ready too,
[10:40:04] <MACscr> so im thinking pretty much like an accordion without the whole jquery ui junk
[10:40:09] <foo> Saaether: hmm, shouldn't this work? http://pastebin.com/X9ZrxDtv
[10:40:20] <madsara> I'm not seeming to be able to... it only works if the function is declared OUTSIDE of the document ready scope.
[10:41:05] <madsara> Although maybe I can do that without repurcussions.
[10:42:27] <Saaether> foo http://pastebin.com/8NSeKERi

[10:49:05] <nick_omega> At this site there is jQuery code being used that acts as an overlay of sorts the html forms. You see the HTML form for a second, then the jQuery kicks in and the forms change form, no pun intended. What tweaks must be made to speed things up so this doesn't happen.

[11:00:36] <jonez> greetings.
[11:01:46] <jonez> I found a jquery-based "upload with progress bar" on the web. I am also using html_quickform from pear on the server side to validate the data. when the upload completes, the response text is sent into a div called "output". rather than do that, I want to have it display the response text as a new page. I tried window.location but that did not solve my problem.
[11:04:19] <QF-MichaelK> I want to use this: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ However, my list is fairly long so I want to limit it by only listing the first 10 or so results.  Any tips on how to do that?
[11:07:34] <shoky> QF-MichaelK you'd need a custom "source" function
[11:08:00] <shoky> that does the filtering and limits the count

[11:30:19] <AmadeuslyFree> can anyone enlighten me with their jquery expertise please?
[11:31:04] <AmadeuslyFree> can anyone enlighten me with their jquery expertise please?
[11:32:35] <myrman> AmadeuslyFree: ask your question
[11:33:13] <AmadeuslyFree> I'm .find and .each to scan through an xml file that has direct URLs within their tags and would like to know if there's a way to only get part of the URL
[11:33:17] <tw2113> enlighten the room with your issue
[11:34:56] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: you can use regexes or a URI parser.
[11:35:06] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: or do you mean part of the XML?
[11:35:54] <AmadeuslyFree> the links themselves reside as part of the XML file
[11:37:35] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: then you can use XPath.
[11:37:45] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: most browsers have XPath support.
[11:38:04] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: well, maybe jQuery's DOM functions will work on XML too.
[11:38:35] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[11:38:52] <rindolf> AmadeuslyFree: I don't know how well it can handle XML namespaces.
[11:40:26] <AmadeuslyFree> well so far my code works well when i have the xml file and the images stored locally a
[11:41:32] <AmadeuslyFree> the only problem is that the same files and images get updated on a different server which causes a cross domain issue with the browser
[11:42:20] <AmadeuslyFree> ...broswer when i switch the url to point to that server.
[11:47:27] <obert> hi,is there a decent lightbox gallery in jquery?

[12:04:03] <Jzarecta> http://jsfiddle.net/uwZ6X/1/
[12:04:42] <Jzarecta> maybe needs to declare the JQuery plugin
[12:05:45] <rindolf> Jzarecta: you can write more complete HTML with <script src="..."
[12:06:20] <Jzarecta> ok it works now, I have to manually add the jquery-ui CDN
[12:06:27] <Jzarecta> and actually works correctly

[12:19:37] <Horriblist> Jzarecta: and what should it be?
[12:23:13] <Horriblist> what is .spinner?

[13:19:31] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm trying to get the <title> from an ajax response. I manage to get a div from the response, but not the title, weirdly. nor the <body>, either..
[13:19:33] <nsanden> ive used jquery a long time and never wrote a plugin yet
[13:20:07] <walidvb> so basically this works: 		var newData = $('#page-content',response);
[13:20:18] <walidvb> but this doesn't		var title = $('head title', response).text();
[13:21:02] <walidvb> any clue why? the second line does work when used on the local context, so i'm guessing that must be the trick. and the response does contain the head element

[13:33:04] <walidvb> but i'm glad you're telling me world goes on
[13:33:14] <ezio> awake
[13:35:01] <r2jitu> @walidvb i'm curious if you were able to get the <title> element
[13:35:09] <walidvb> still not..
[13:35:19] <r2jitu> lemme give it a shot
[13:35:21] <walidvb> read a couple of answers on the net, but they all have the obvious
[13:36:13] <walidvb> would be much cleaner to have my site answer json, and put the title in there, but that's not how i'm gonna do it ;)
[13:36:36] <r2jitu> are you doing something similar to: $.get(..., function(data) { var $page = $(data); console.log($page.find("html title").text()); }); ?
[13:36:47] <walidvb> yep
[13:37:13] <walidvb> i tried that, but i'm actually on $('head title', data).text()
[13:37:30] <r2jitu> that's probably equivalent
[13:37:36] <r2jitu> hmm, try console.log($(data))
[13:37:44] <r2jitu> i wonder if that strips away the head
[13:37:45] <walidvb> (which works on the current page, but not on that context. i also tried with the raw data
[13:38:23] <walidvb> i'll try. but it's weird, cause i later do a $('#page-wrapper', data), and that works just fine
[13:39:56] <walidvb> it returns an object, i'm trying to figure how to have firebug let me see the html of it
[13:40:01] <walidvb> but i'll just .html() it.
[13:40:20] <r2jitu> oh, i use chrome which lets me inspect it
[13:41:10] <walidvb> r2jitu: hm html() returns undefind...
[13:42:17] <walidvb> $(response) is undefined too... very weird
[13:42:37] <walidvb> (response does contain the whole html of the url loaded)
[13:43:41] <r2jitu> hmm
[13:44:11] <walidvb> should i maybe parse it? but how come it'll take any element WITHIN the body?
[13:44:56] <r2jitu> yeah, i think you should get an html parser library
[13:45:20] <walidvb> like jquery? ;P
[13:45:20] <cusco> tidy
[13:45:39] <walidvb> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[13:45:43] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/902872/ how i can do this with getJSON? i have $.getJSON('http://' + server + '/api/v1/images/pre/', function() {..}); but what with datatype and jsonp?
[13:45:47] <r2jitu> i think what happens is that when jquery tries to convert a string into a jquery element, it has to create a DOM element behind the scenes
[13:45:48] <cusco> xml != html
[13:45:50] <Eviltwin> The best HTML parser in existence is the DOM
[13:46:00] <Eviltwin> Or the browser, rather
[13:46:07] <r2jitu> just use a bit of regex
[13:46:09] <r2jitu> if it's just the title
[13:46:26] <cusco> Eviltwin: I second that, and then libtidy
[13:46:28] <Eviltwin> *cringe*
[13:46:37] <walidvb> argh. are you the kind of guy who outputs a regex in a minute?
[13:46:40] <walidvb> i'm not ;)
[13:46:41] <Eviltwin> Regexes for a context-free language?
[13:46:54] <Horriblist> Eviltwin: lol
[13:47:04] <Horriblist> is the other twin here?
[13:47:07] <walidvb> xml isn't html, but html is xml no?
[13:47:17] <Eviltwin> No
[13:47:19] <Eviltwin> XHTML is XML
[13:47:26] <walidvb> arm...
[13:47:28] <Eviltwin> HTML is not strict enought to be HRML
[13:47:30] <Eviltwin> XML*
[13:47:36] <Eviltwin> Let's say that again
[13:47:39] <Eviltwin> HTML is not strict enought to be XML
[13:47:46] <walidvb> haha i heard you
[13:47:56] <r2jitu> console.log(/<title>(.*)<\/title>/.exec(data)[1]);
[13:48:08] <walidvb> but anyway, i have xhtml coming from my server. so couldn't i use parseXML?
[13:48:10] <Eviltwin> How about making that not greedy
[13:48:32] <Eviltwin> Seeing as I think in HTML5, you're allowed to use title tags to mean something else elsewhere in the body
[13:49:04] <walidvb> you mean i should get the title from the body, not the head
[13:49:10] <r2jitu> walidvb: another idea is to create a hidden iframe and use it to make your request, then you can navigate the dom to get the title
[13:49:25] <Eviltwin> Eh, I don't like that
[13:49:30] <Eviltwin> It means the scripts will all execute as well
[13:49:31] <r2jitu> why not?
[13:49:31] <walidvb> r2jitu: argh. for just that i hope to find an easier solution
[13:49:34] <r2jitu> true...
[13:49:38] <walidvb> true true
[13:50:12] <walidvb> r2jitu: your regex worked
[13:50:14] <walidvb> :)
[13:50:15] <walidvb> thanks
[13:50:19] <r2jitu> np
[13:50:47] <walidvb> i gotta run now, brb for the rest of the conversation
[13:51:44] <nick_omega> At this site, brightnight.us, there is jQuery code being used that acts as an overlay of sorts the html forms. You see the HTML form for a second, then the jQuery kicks in and the forms change form, no pun intended. What tweaks must be made to speed things up so this doesn't happen.
[13:52:14] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQ
[13:54:41] <r2jitu> nick_omega: you can't really speed it up because the page first gets rendered then scripts run. instead you should set the css to display: none for those forms so that they don't appear until your script runs
[13:59:51] <csalvato> Hey guys!  Anyone know a good in-page support tool for chat boxes? something that will let people chat with us when they need support?
[14:08:00] <johnkpaul> csalvato: there's a few difernt companies that provide that service
[14:08:04] <johnkpaul> I've used liveperson and rightnow
[14:09:38] <jrockjiggz> hi.. i have an object, and i'm trying to refer to a property, but i get: //Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'landingPage'
[14:09:58] <csalvato> thanks johnkpaul  :)
[14:09:59] <jrockjiggz> but if I type in console: ich.landingPage i get the response
[14:10:47] <jrockjiggz> hmm. yea its a scope issue.. nm
[14:21:31] <guideX> say there's a div with a class called "myDiv" and i'm looking for the text "myText" and I wish to hide all instances of that... how do I do it?
[14:21:50] <guideX> so I want to hide all <div class="myDiv">MyText</div>
[14:21:53] <Horriblist> hahah i too add my... to my stuff lol
[14:22:00] <guideX> heh
[14:22:13] <guideX> well it's something else, but just for simplicities sake
[14:22:14] <NoiseEee> guideX: let's get the first part of your request done first.  so, how to get all divs with the class 'myDiv' ?
[14:22:20] <Horriblist> there must lots of myThnkgs floating around lol
[14:22:30] <guideX> $('div.MyDiv')
[14:22:36] <Horriblist> no wtg
[14:22:36] <guideX> but I don't know how to get all of them
[14:22:42] <Horriblist> dotn do div.
[14:22:48] <defaultro_> hey folks, I have this html. The value Consumer Electronics Store changes based from what we select from the dropdown. The dropdown doesn't use <select>. I'm adding a .change() to it but is not able to see that I changed the value.
[14:22:53] <defaultro_> <input id="type" class="" type="text" disabled="disabled" name="type" style="display: inline;"><span class="inputValue" style="display: none;">Consumer Electronics Store</span>
[14:22:56] <guideX> ah ok, then just $('.myDiv')
[14:23:10] <Horriblist> yes
[14:23:16] <NoiseEee> ok.
[14:23:17] <Horriblist> ok whoat do you want to hide
[14:23:23] <Horriblist> the div or the text
[14:23:29] <guideX> both really
[14:23:31] <guideX> or delete them
[14:23:39] <guideX> it's divs containing that text
[14:23:41] <guideX> with that class
[14:23:46] <Horriblist> ok so $('.mydiv').hide();
[14:23:55] <NoiseEee> Horriblist: now you want to refine your search to divs that *contain* certain text. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[14:24:03] <guideX> oh ok, but only when it has that text in it
[14:24:07] <Horriblist> oh
[14:24:17] <NoiseEee> sorry guideX: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[14:24:59] <Horriblist> then you just either made an if ().html() == 'mytext'
[14:25:07] <Horriblist> or use that containts thing
[14:25:13] <Hapzzz> $(this).parentsUntil('.edit-div').find('.edit-task')
[14:25:19] <Hapzzz> how is that bad
[14:25:57] <NoiseEee> guideX: so, any ideas on what your selector would be?
[14:26:35] <defaultro_> This is not working, $('#form-poi input[name="type"]').next().change(onTypeChange);
[14:26:41] <guideX> oh that totally worked
[14:27:02] <guideX> so my end code is... $('div.field-label:contains("Gallery Vehicle Images:")').hide();
[14:27:11] <NoiseEee> guideX++
[14:27:24] <NoiseEee> good job
[14:27:27] <guideX> thx :)
[14:27:33] <guideX> thanks for your guys's help :)
[14:27:52] <NoiseEee> np thanks for working at it instead of just asking for a handout :)
[14:28:01] <guideX> a cms won't get rid of a stupid label
[14:28:10] <guideX> so I use jquery to slap it in the face, etc
[14:28:20] <guideX> well what will I learn with the handouts :)
[14:28:23] <defaultro_> is it because of this vavlue, disabled="disabled"
[14:28:40] <guideX> there's nothing like typing it/screwing it up until it works,. then you just know it
[14:28:40] <Horriblist> vavlue
[14:28:42] <Horriblist> lol
[14:29:07] <defaultro_> lol
[14:29:08] <defaultro_> value of course
[14:29:28] <defaultro_> don't  need to correct it, it's a waste of energy
[14:29:38] <Hapzzz> anyone?
[14:29:51] <defaultro_> Horriblist: but do you have solution to it?
[14:30:08] <Horriblist> there has to be another way to write that contains
[14:30:31] <Horriblist> i dont like the quotes inside quotes thing
[14:30:39] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: what's not working?
[14:30:49] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: have you confirmed your selector is getting what you think its getting?
[14:30:49] <defaultro_> hi Noisee
[14:30:54] <defaultro_> yes
[14:31:01] <defaultro_> i used .val() and I got the data
[14:31:12] <defaultro_> .text() sorry
[14:31:15] <NoiseEee> ok
[14:31:19] <NoiseEee> so what does 'not working' mean
[14:32:08] <nickSwe> Just want to give a public THANKS to shoky! You've helped me for the last HOURS with my problem and we finally sorted it out! Guys like you make it worth while using channels like these! PayPal donation is on the way! Should be more guys like you around! Thanks again! :)
[14:32:09] <defaultro_> this is the command that works in console, $('#form-poi input[name="type"]').val()
[14:32:28] <defaultro_> NoiseEee: I want to put .change() so I can monitor if it changes
[14:32:38] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: use on()
[14:32:43] <defaultro_> ?
[14:32:44] <Horriblist> i really dont like how you guys are doing quotes insite quotes
[14:32:49] <NoiseEee> Horriblist: noted, thanks.
[14:33:05] <Horriblist> who taught you this madness
[14:33:18] <Horriblist> that 12 yr kid from google talk
[14:33:26] <defaultro_> me?
[14:33:32] <NoiseEee> yeah Horriblist, exactly
[14:34:14] <defaultro_> NoiseEee: like this, $('#form-poi input[name="type"]').on(onTypeChange);
[14:34:32] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: nope, but maybe someone else can take over, im out
[14:34:33] <NoiseEee> later folks
[14:34:41] <defaultro_> have a great evning
[14:34:44] <Horriblist> ok so
[14:41:59] <obert_> hi,asked before my disconnection. is there a decent lightbox gallery in jquery?
[14:43:38] <Hereisanotherlie> obert_: of course there is :)
[14:43:48] <Hereisanotherlie> obert_: some of these look pretty decent http://www.freshdesignweb.com/jquery-lightbox-plugin-image-gallery.html
[14:44:01] <obert_> Hereisanotherlie: which one and is it used more commonly than lightbox nowdays?
[14:44:30] <Hereisanotherlie> obert_: I don't know honestly, I tend to write my own
[14:44:43] <obert_> jquery/ajax?
[14:44:54] <Hereisanotherlie> yep
[14:45:56] <obert_> gotcha
[14:46:23] <obert_> just use the framework indeed
[14:47:16] <obert_> i'll see. thank you
[14:47:44] <obert_> would be that long to write my own?
[14:47:49] <defaultro_> :( still can't make .change() work
[14:48:02] <Horriblist> defaultro_: paste code
[14:48:17] <defaultro_> ok, I will put it in jsfiddle
[14:48:34] <obert_> use tinkerbin :)
[14:48:39] <Horriblist> can you do jstrumpet?
[14:49:05] <Horriblist> jkjk
[14:52:27] <mohi666> is there any way to define a function to be executed after all the events are executed for an element?
[14:53:13] <BinaryKitten> all events?
[14:53:27] <BinaryKitten> sounds like you need deferred/promise
[14:53:44] <BinaryKitten> ?$.when
[14:53:47] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[14:54:24] <BinaryKitten> mohi666 depends really what you mean by "all events"
[14:54:27] <relipse> can someone please go to https://cworklog.com and login with test116 test116 and click "Add Work Log" and tell me why dialog box is not any taller (height is not working)
[14:55:14] <mohi666> thanks, I will look into it.
[14:56:47] <Hapzzz> $('#test').parentsUntil('#testdiv').html();
[14:56:52] <Hapzzz> why parentsUntil won't work
[14:56:53] <Hapzzz> ffs
[14:57:03] <Hapzzz> parentsUntil('html') would get me to parent()
[14:58:00] <BinaryKitten> Hapzzz tries a jsfiddle?
[14:58:15] <BinaryKitten> might be something else outside that is affecting your code
[14:58:48] <relipse> hello?
[14:59:04] <jrockjiggz> loading a script in within a fragment such as $(data).html('#fragment'); will not execute the script contents.......
[14:59:31] <jrockjiggz> sorry. $(data).find('#fragment').appendTo(target)
[14:59:50] <jrockjiggz> that sucks..
[15:03:29] <jrockjiggz> innerHTML to the rescue. heh
[15:04:24] <Hapzzz> http://jsfiddle.net/xfxQD/
[15:04:43] <defaultro_> Horriblist: sorry, wife asked something to do. Here it is -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y2Djt/
[15:05:44] <defaultro_> Horriblist: the change is not working. It doesn't see the change when I choose another value
[15:05:46] <naeluh> Hi I am having an issue with the colorbox plugin
[15:06:32] <naeluh> I have my code set up properly but it opens the link without opening it in the the modal window I have done this several times before and it has always worked
[15:06:42] <Horriblist> wait now i need help
[15:06:44] <Horriblist> projectionMatrix = glm::ortho(0.0f, (float)window.width, (float)window.height, 0.0f, 0.1f, 100.0f);
[15:06:59] <Horriblist> cant see my text
[15:07:09] <naeluh> here is the link http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site3/#c its the media tab
[15:07:16] <defaultro_> Horriblist: here is an update, http://jsfiddle.net/Y2Djt/1/
[15:07:37] <naeluh> I am not getting any errors in the js so its weird that its not working ?
[15:07:37] <defaultro_> wow, that's complex for my skilllevel Horriblist  :)
[15:08:27] <Hapzzz> anyone?
[15:08:40] <naeluh> I have many jquery plugins working fine also -- so its weird that this one is not firing ?
[15:08:42] <nick_omega> r2jitu thanks
[15:09:26] <Horriblist> are you getting something logged?
[15:09:49] <Horriblist> also i dont think input has a change event
[15:09:55] <Horriblist> try onblur
[15:10:37] <naeluh> is there anyway to tell if another script is causing not to work?
[15:10:57] <defaultro_> Horriblist: i guess I found a solution and I might have similar issue to what he's experiencing, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10958529/jquery-how-to-handle-change-text-of-span
[15:11:22] <Horriblist> i always handle it w onblur
[15:11:40] <Horriblist> .change doesnt apply to inputs
[15:11:52] <Horriblist> or .focus
[15:12:08] <naeluh> is there any other info I can provide that might be helpful ?
[15:14:13] <defaultro_> ok
[15:14:27] <defaultro_> is onblur supported in jquery?
[15:14:42] <defaultro_> for inputs, I use keyup
[15:14:49] <Horriblist> yeah
[15:14:55] <Horriblist> omg totaly spaced that
[15:15:02] <Horriblist> thats exactly what i use
[15:15:05] <defaultro_> but in our scenario, keyup won't work because I am choosing from a dropdown
[15:15:17] <Horriblist> depends on what you are doing tho
[15:15:23] <Horriblist> since keyup hapens alot
[15:15:37] <defaultro_> the input gets updated when i choose something in dropdown
[15:15:42] <defaultro_> what function should I use then?
[15:15:47] <Horriblist> then change
[15:15:52] <defaultro_> doens't work
[15:15:58] <shoky> relipse: hi
[15:15:59] <Horriblist> put .change to the dropdown
[15:16:08] <shoky> relipse: the onchange of the <select> is changing the height to 180
[15:16:30] <shoky> relipse: and its being triggered by $(frmAddWorkLog.company_id).trigger('change');
[15:16:50] <defaultro_> it's somewhat a dropdown but it's really now. We're showing a window containing the choices
[15:17:03] <defaultro_> it's really not
[15:17:24] <defaultro_> .change doesn't work on spans
[15:17:31] <Horriblist> no lol
[15:17:39] <defaultro_> and if you recall from my code, the value gets inserted between span tag
[15:17:43] <Horriblist> youll have to sit back and think it through
[15:17:48] <defaultro_> yup
[15:18:00] <Horriblist> but its all posible
[15:18:09] <Horriblist> since dropdowns are history anyhow
[15:18:30] <Horriblist> i handle mine with input and span
[15:18:32] <mohi666> how do you disable a submit button, after it's pressed?
[15:18:50] <Horriblist> lol mohi666 is this for a shopping cart lol
[15:19:09] <mohi666> no, for a django admin
[15:19:14] <Horriblist> $(input).disabled(true);
[15:19:14] <mohi666> it's supposed to be a hack
[15:19:20] <Horriblist> something like that
[15:19:30] <Horriblist> its also not a hack totaly valid
[15:19:46] <Horriblist> and should be caught on the php side too
[15:19:56] <mohi666> Hornet: When I do that, when it doesn't set my button's value to post request anymore
[15:20:01] <Horriblist> i guess that means server side
[15:20:47] <Horriblist> mohi666: you have to do it after you press as a callback
[15:20:51] <Horriblist> lol
[15:20:57] <Horriblist> wtf guys
[15:21:19] <Horriblist> did you just fall from the moon
[15:21:41] <mohi666> Yeah, I just did.
[15:21:44] <Horriblist> o_____o
[15:21:56] <Horriblist> welcome to my planet
[15:23:35] <mohi666> I'm disabling the attr on my button's submit event, but when I do that my button's value is not passed to the next page as it is disabled
[15:24:13] <naeluh> figure it out I had already put colorbox in another js file and was calling it twice thanks !
[15:27:39] <jrockjiggz> is there a native alternative for filter() or find() ?
[15:27:51] <jrockjiggz> it seems filter() is stripping <script>
[15:27:58] <jrockjiggz> or find() is
[15:28:47] <sheilablackrose> hi guys im working on a project that has a jquery code that acts on a table. is there away to get it to ignore a specific class or td? http://jsfiddle.net/XD7JK/
[15:34:13] <Einzig_> hello
[15:37:31] <sheilablackrose> is there away to do ignore a class? like if i have a <td=mytd> ignore anyother class that effects it?
[15:38:16] <coldhead> you can do font-size: initial; to ignore particular properties from the unwanted class
[15:38:21] <coldhead> you can't ditch the whole thing
[15:38:28] <Einzig_> I have a form with an id and try to select the id of a clicked element within this form. when I try to get the id of the element I get id_of_form:id_of_element.  How can I select the latter id?
[15:38:33] <Horriblist> my fase itches
[15:38:40] <Horriblist> wtf
[15:38:43] <Horriblist> so annoying
[15:41:04] <Einzig_> (the form automatically gets an id, because I use java server faces. Else I'd just remove the id.)
[15:41:59] <sheilablackrose> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/XD7JK/ this effects the whole table is there away i can exempt it from a particular td?
[15:46:04] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: i don't see anything related to your question in that fiddle but is this what you're on about http://jsfiddle.net/jnBau/ ?
[15:48:33] <jrockjiggz> I need to use filter() to find a match within the root of my data, but it is not recursive, so I am testing with if(filter.length == 0){ //use find() }.. but i feel there is a better way
[15:49:26] <sheilablackrose> something like that let me see if i can use that
[15:49:29] <sheilablackrose> thanks coldhead
[15:50:43] <coldhead> good luck sheilablackrose
[15:51:42] <sheilablackrose> tq
[15:51:45] <Horriblist> ok finally
[15:51:53] <Horriblist> i got some text going
[15:51:58] <Horriblist> in 2d
[15:53:12] <coldhead> in your face, gutenberg
[15:53:27] <Horriblist> you tell him coldhead
[15:54:26] <Hapzzz> http://pastebin.com/AHcfRnFF
[15:54:28] <Hapzzz> ideas?
[15:54:39] <Hapzzz> it's bringing the content of the div above #test
[15:56:15] <shoky> Hapzzz: are there 8 .edit-task elements?
[15:56:58] <Hapzzz> just 2 in the whole page
[15:57:38] <shoky> well, that would get the parentsUntil of both of them
[15:58:03] <shoky> also, an id must be unique.. do you have more than one #test element
[15:58:09] <Hapzzz> nah, one
[15:58:12] <Hapzzz> for testing purposes
[15:58:28] <shoky> then why are you surprised that parentsUntil returns a lot of ancestors?
[15:59:02] <Hapzzz> what do you mean?
[15:59:04] <shoky> are both .edit-task eleemnts direct children of the one #test element ?
[15:59:26] <Hapzzz> oh i see where you're getting at
[16:02:55] <Hapzzz> shoky http://pastebin.com/Lgjw5fGn
[16:02:56] <Hapzzz> how about that one
[16:03:32] <Hapzzz> should be 2, i guess?
[16:03:54] <Horriblist> (x, y - (h * (i + 1)), 0) mmmmaaaaffffff!
[16:06:16] <shoky> ?parentUntil @ Hapzzz
[16:06:20] <shoky> ?parentsUntil @ Hapzzz
[16:06:27] <bot-t> Hapzzz, .parent() - Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[16:06:29] <bot-t> Hapzzz, .parentsUntil([selector], [filter]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[16:06:40] <shoky> Hapzzz: up to but not including
[16:06:52] <Hapzzz> umm
[16:06:55] <Hapzzz> what's my alternative then
[16:07:25] <Hapzzz> i need to go up to .edit-div (can be N levels above), and then find the first .edit-task
[16:07:30] <coldhead> flash?
[16:07:35] <shoky> ?closest
[16:07:39] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[16:07:55] <Hapzzz> that won't hit siblings
[16:08:06] <shoky> siblings of whom
[16:08:39] <Hapzzz> check my last paste
[16:08:56] <Hapzzz> the .edit-task is a sibling of the #test
[16:09:05] <Hapzzz> closest() won't find it i think
[16:09:14] <jrockjiggz> windows 8 is doing it all wrong.. its capitalizing all my files but i when i go to rename.. i see the true name with lowercase...
[16:09:15] <Hapzzz> it could be anywhere within the .edit-div
[16:09:19] <shoky> it'll do the first step in:  <Hapzzz> i need to go up to .edit-div (can be N levels above), and then find the first .edit-task
[16:09:30] <shoky> you still need to do the second step, yes :P
[16:09:37] <Hapzzz> ok lemme try.
[16:09:41] <shoky> or
[16:09:47] <shoky> use .siblings  :P
[16:09:50] <shoky> if they're actually siblings
[16:10:25] <Hapzzz> i can't tell if they are sibligns beforehand
[16:10:31] <Hapzzz> i mean i can, but the pages change
[16:10:39] <shoky> oks. .closest is your friend then
[16:11:24] <Hapzzz> awesome.
[16:11:33] <Hapzzz> that took me only 7 hrs or so
[16:11:49] <coldhead> great work Hapzzz
[16:11:54] <shoky> ;]
[16:11:55] <coldhead> why don't you take a short break
[16:26:18] <davidobrien> http://thedod.github.com/socialshareprivacy/about.html
[16:26:22] <davidobrien> started this project awhile ago
[16:26:25] <davidobrien> let me knwo what you think
[16:35:11] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm having issues with pushstate. I've been reading a lot, but i'm not sure i get it. I have this site, that pushState on ajaxLoad, and that ajaxLoad onpopstate
[16:35:48] <walidvb> however, it won't really pop more than one state. as in, you can only click 'back' once. also, it doesn't let you 'forward' anymore.
[16:36:10] <walidvb> the easiest to reproduce is to visit  http://moijconnais.com
[16:36:20] <walidvb> and click more or less whatever link
[16:38:42] <davidobrien> did u see this plugin that i wrote?
[16:38:45] <sheilablackrose> how can i say if this is not a ('mytd') click.
[16:43:48] <thewrath> hello
[16:43:52] <thewrath> i was hoping someone coudl help me
[16:44:05] <thewrath> i want to do something silmiar with jquery as this http://css3.wdfiles.com/local--code/blog%3Aanimated-page-entry-with-css3/5
[16:44:05] <Horriblist> orly?
[16:44:09] <walidvb> davidobrien: really like the idea!
[16:44:24] <davidobrien> thanks walidvb
[16:44:25] <thewrath> unless someone can tell me that works on FF
[16:44:31] <davidobrien> theres an english version too walidvb
[16:44:37] <davidobrien> i really wish more sites would use it :/
[16:44:45] <walidvb> is it a js?
[16:45:04] <walidvb> you should turn it into a chrome/ff plugin
[16:46:44] <thewrath> walidvb: davidobrien ?
[16:46:52] <walidvb> ?
[16:47:41] <thewrath> http://css3.wdfiles.com/local--code/blog%3Aanimated-page-entry-with-css3/5 know how i can do this in js
[16:47:56] <walidvb> ?animate?
[16:47:57] <thewrath> apparently the animation is not working in FF like it is advertise it will
[16:47:57] <bot-t> walidvb, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:48:32] <walidvb> thewrath: you need vendor prefix
[16:48:42] <walidvb> jsfiddle your code
[16:48:54] <thewrath> jsfiddle?
[16:48:59] <thewrath> i do and it does nto wokr
[16:49:02] <walidvb> ?jsfiddle

[16:49:41] <thewrath> ok
[16:49:49] <thewrath> walidvb: standy by i will fsdiffle it
[16:49:52] <thewrath> fsfiddle

[17:23:24] <walidvb> bye!
[17:23:50] <thewrath> i know you are not here
[17:24:01] <thewrath> i have that
[17:24:04] <thewrath> there is somethign else i am missing
[17:25:38] <tw2113> -ms-
[17:30:49] <coachz>   any tips on how i can work on unminified files locally, and minified when I deploy my repo ?  i use git
[17:31:08] <Caelum> coachz: minification is overrated
[17:31:45] <Caelum> coachz: you can just put something in a deploy script
[17:31:49] <coachz> really ?
[17:31:55] <coachz> like what?
[17:32:28] <Caelum> code that uses some perl/ruby/python/whatever module to minify the js/css
[17:32:43] <Caelum> there are lots of those
[17:32:52] <coachz> ok thanks
[17:33:19] <Caelum> coachz: anyway, minification won't really have any effect of user load times these days
[17:34:19] <coachz> ahhh
[17:34:30] <coachz> so screw it
[17:38:25] <coachz> is h
[17:38:30] <coachz> oops
[17:40:09] <coachz> is there a good app for site deployment ?
[17:44:57] <yogurt_truck> Caelum: minification still matters
[17:45:44] <Caelum> yogurt_truck: how so
[17:46:37] <benlieb> I have 3 elements on the page with class='flash'. I want them all to disappear, one after another.
[17:47:06] <MistuhKurtz> Caelum, minifying all your scripts into a single file reduces HTTP requests, which introduce a lot of overhead.
[17:47:18] <benlieb> this makes them disappear at once: jQuery('.flash').hide(2000);
[17:47:24] <Caelum> MistuhKurtz: the key is single file, not the minification
[17:47:29] <MistuhKurtz> I know that
[17:47:41] <MistuhKurtz> but if you have a deploy process that combines them, why not minify at the same time?
[17:47:45] <benlieb> but slowly
[17:48:10] <benlieb> I thought this would work to do one at a time, but they all disappear immediately with no animation: jQuery('.flash').each(function(){this.hide(2000)});
[17:48:13] <benlieb> what am I missing?
[17:48:50] <shoky> a delay/timeout
[17:48:51] <Caelum> benlieb: you need to do a setTimeout to make the second one disappear after the first one finishes disappearing
[17:49:32] <benlieb> Caelum: ok, but why does this make them disappear with no transition:  jQuery('.flash').each(function(){this.hide(2000)});
[17:49:35] <coachz> right
[17:49:43] <shoky> benlieb here's one way- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7QwMk/4/
[17:49:43] <coachz> one file is good
[17:50:44] <benlieb> shoky: interesting. never heard of promise
[17:51:22] <shoky> benlieb here's a way just with delaying - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7QwMk/5/
[17:51:47] <yogurt_truck> Caelum: because minification of css and js reduces size and therefore load times?
[17:52:26] <coachz> benlieb. http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/12/jquerydeferred-is-most-important-client.html?m=1
[17:52:29] <Caelum> shoky: what is anim.bind ?
[17:53:18] <shoky> ?g mdn bind @ Caelum
[17:53:19] <bot-t> Caelum, bind - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[17:54:24] <Caelum> shoky: aha, so that's the same as: .done(function() { anim(i+1) })
[17:54:26] <Caelum> shoky: neat
[17:54:44] <shoky> yeapp
[17:54:48] <casualuser> greetings, everybody! =D
[17:56:38] <casualuser> trying to implement featured jquery-ui slider design with slider rotated to custom angle found that it's moving up-down while changing value via mouse
[17:57:02] <casualuser> and it's really not so clear how to set it fixed
[17:57:17] <casualuser> can some one suggest anything?
[17:57:32] <shoky> ?demo @ casualuser
[17:57:32] <bot-t> casualuser, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:57:54] <casualuser> slider design looks similar to vlc volume control
[17:58:23] <casualuser> shoky, just a moment - will upload latest version to server
[18:05:00] <casualuser> so here is live demo - http://webomage.com/html5player/
[18:08:47] <casualuser> shoky, design very similar to vlc volume slider - http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/attachment/ticket/5040/VLC-Volume-Control-Dark.png
[18:10:23] <casualuser> shoky, now slider just raw styled at http://webomage.com/html5player/
[18:10:37] <benlieb> shoky: it looks like hide() has a finish callback. I came up with this. I couldn't really understand yours anyway (over my head).
[18:10:40] <benlieb> http://jsfiddle.net/gwHcX/1/
[18:12:01] <shoky> benlieb ya that works too
[18:14:01] <casualuser> ppl, please look at my custom angle slider implementation raw draft and give few words if it looks possible at all
[18:14:09] <shoky> casualuser: um most of the screen is blank
[18:14:17] <shoky> casualuser: cant see #v-slider
[18:14:41] <shoky> casualuser: most elements are stacked on top of one another on the right side of the page
[18:15:08] <casualuser> shoky, that's right right top corner have four cells
[18:15:19] <casualuser> one for share buttons
[18:15:39] <shoky> ok.. no idea whats going on there..
[18:15:46] <casualuser> second with volume slider
[18:15:59] <casualuser> 3d with quality slider
[18:16:12] <casualuser> and 4th with fullscreen button
[18:16:50] <shoky> this is what i see.. http://i.imgur.com/WvcS5.png
[18:18:23] <casualuser> you're right - red rectngls is background placeholder and horizontal white slider
[18:18:51] <shoky> mm ok
[18:18:51] <casualuser> check this image to get the idea of slider - http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/attachment/ticket/5040/VLC-Volume-Control-Dark.png
[18:19:02] <shoky> yah.
[18:19:54] <shoky> because of the rotation
[18:20:43] <casualuser> it's keep moving up/down while changing value
[18:20:50] <shoky> yea this is a css question
[18:20:55] <casualuser> here is the design view http://webomage.com/html5player/video_white.jpg
[18:20:59] <shoky> drop the jquery ui when you ask it.
[18:21:59] <casualuser> tried to drop jqueryui style and add custom
[18:22:09] <casualuser> *slider stile
[18:22:18] <casualuser> *style
[18:22:19] <casualuser> )
[18:22:24] <shoky> sure, but you need to add the correct style
[18:22:36] <shoky> to make the rotation work as you want it
[18:23:37] <shoky> you need to change the rotation's origin, i think
[18:23:41] <shoky> ask on #css
[18:25:20] <casualuser> shoky, do you know if there is jquery-ui slider elements scheme with styles names exists ?
[18:25:31] <shoky> what?
[18:25:44] <shoky> donno what you mean
[18:27:19] <casualuser> a picture with slider elements with css class style and id names
[18:29:33] <tw2113> don't most sliders make you do that yourself?
[18:30:23] <casualuser> in case in firebug do not show slider inner elements it's not so easy to guess which one to style...
[18:30:41] <casualuser> tw2113, check the design - http://webomage.com/html5player/video_white.jpg
[18:31:05] <tw2113> ohh
[18:31:11] <tw2113> that type of slider
[18:31:16] <tw2113> i was thinking image gallery style
[18:31:39] <casualuser> tw2113, that's the case )
[18:32:06] <casualuser> tw2113, do you have any ideas how to style slider for this?
[18:32:16] <tw2113> nope
[18:33:29] <casualuser> tw2113, that's the question - there is no any guides or anything even at stackoverflow, even questions with comments, not answers
[18:34:21] <casualuser> and it's even just not so easy to guess which words to use for search
[18:34:39] <casualuser> the best match "like vlc volume slider"
[18:35:12] <casualuser> but there is only one post about similar slider for .net framework
[18:35:30] <tw2113> i think scrubber is a word associated with those
[18:35:36] <paul_irish> use a input type range
[18:35:43] <paul_irish> on change you update the width of a div
[18:35:50] <paul_irish> that has a css gradient background
[18:35:55] <paul_irish> and stretches behind it
[18:36:07] <paul_irish> and you can even style the pointer on the range slider
[18:36:17] <paul_irish> and position the timecode above it
[18:36:23] <tw2113> evening Paul
[18:36:32] <paul_irish> hai
[18:37:04] <casualuser> paul_irish, sure i see that div size is changing with value changes but in this case here is good question - which one element to style ?
[18:37:21] <paul_irish> here are some linkzz
[18:37:22] <paul_irish> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3556157/how-to-customize-the-html5-input-range-type-looks-using-css

[18:38:04] <paul_irish> http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/implementing-iphone-slider-unlock-with-input-type-range
[18:38:10] <shoky> casualuser: try .ui-slider-range { -webkit-transform-origin: rotate(10deg); -webkit-transform-origin: 0 50% }
[18:38:25] <shoky> casualuser: that should make it stop moving up and down
[18:38:56] <shoky> (to fix earlier issue)
[18:39:41] <shoky> casualuser: oops the first one is -webkit-transform  not -webkit-transform-origin
[18:39:44] <shoky> obviously.
[18:40:32] <shoky> (and keep the height:100% and border )
[18:41:07] <casualuser> it seems -webkit-transform-origin: 0 50% was just the thing i was loking for
[18:41:13] <MeMReS> having a problem with IE8 where whenever something starts with $.something it gives me an error null or not an object.. why is this and how do i fix it?
[18:41:55] <casualuser> shoky, thx a lot - you shed some light into my 24h uptime head
[18:42:14] <shoky> np
[18:46:46] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[18:47:36] <tw2113> *hugs shokey-bro-sky*
[18:48:39] <shoky> you like me, you really like me
[18:48:44] * shoky cries
[18:49:18] <MeMReS> ok when everyone gets back from their 5 min break i need some help too =P
[18:49:59] <shoky> ?demo @ MeMReS
[18:49:59] <bot-t> MeMReS, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:50:02] <paul_irish> sounds like jquery isnt loading correctly
[18:50:15] <paul_irish> check network tab of devtools and you probably got a 404 or somethin
[18:51:21] <MeMReS> run in IETester if ya got it: http://philcocommunications.com/testindex.php
[18:51:33] <shoky> IETester--
[18:55:54] <MeMReS> guess you could run compatibility mode it's about the same as far as the errors go
[19:06:34] <sunbeam> Guys, what do you think is the most used jquery slider plugin?
[19:06:36] <sunbeam> Flex slider?
[19:06:44] <sunbeam> or seen as the best one
[19:11:11] <shoky> MeMReS: i have a suspicion that it's because of the first line in jquery.timers.js
[19:11:17] <shoky> MeMReS:  var jQuery = typeof(jQuery) === 'undefined' ? null : jQuery;
[19:11:34] <shoky> MeMReS: i think it's overwriting the global jQuery reference
[19:11:37] <shoky> in IE8
[19:11:56] <shoky> MeMReS: try commenting that line
[19:13:12] <shoky> this shows it too: http://jsfiddle.net/aabK2/
[19:14:36] <MeMReS> ok will do
[19:18:18] <MeMReS> [shoky] your a genius..

[20:53:10] <divxkorea> Hi. All.
[20:53:24] <divxkorea> I have one question.
[20:54:09] <vladikoff> divxkorea, ok
[20:55:04] <tw2113> that's all you get...ONE
[20:55:22] <tw2113> make it good
[20:55:37] <divxkorea> I checked on the radio button with the same name that you want to change to true.
[20:55:49] <divxkorea> $(":input:radio[id*='AMERICAN_EXPRESS']").attr("checked",true);
[20:55:55] <divxkorea> am i right?
[20:57:14] <divxkorea> oh my mistake.
[20:58:21] <divxkorea> anybody else?
[20:59:03] <relipse2> would anyone mind testing my new work-log-time-tracking invoice website for me https://cworklog.com
[20:59:41] <voot545> JSONP / usual script tag requests are cross-domain, but can't go from http to https on the same domain?
[21:00:11] <coldhead> divxkorea: i think these days we're supposed to use prop() instead of attr()
[21:00:44] <divxkorea> okay coldhead thank you!^^
[21:00:45] <coldhead> the selector looks okay
[21:09:35] <SlexAxton> thnx for the safety tips tw2113
[21:10:24] <tw2113> I do what I can
[21:10:31] <coldhead> you're a saint
[21:10:35] <tw2113> another safety tip?don't trust coldhead
[21:10:40] <tw2113> i'm certain it's his 2nd day
[21:11:22] <coldhead> i think i'd remember if i'd done this before
[21:11:48] <tw2113> that's what the government wants you to think
[21:12:23] <oojacoboo> wow, js for loop is sooo much faster than $.each()
[21:14:00] <coldhead> yes but each() works in more places
[21:14:16] <oojacoboo> ya
[21:16:40] <SlexAxton> $.each() is better than js for loop because it takes its time
[21:16:47] <SlexAxton> so the bits don't get jumbled up
[21:16:51] <oojacoboo> lol
[21:16:54] <SlexAxton> and come out all weird on the other side
[21:17:12] <SlexAxton> also because of a new context
[21:17:13] <coldhead> choosy jews choose each()
[21:17:26] <oojacoboo> it's like 30x slower ;)
[21:17:34] <coldhead> 30x more careful
[21:19:17] <coldhead> 30x more in love
[21:19:22] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[21:19:23] <SlexAxton> I told everyone at work
[21:19:27] <coldhead> how's it working out sheilablackrose
[21:19:36] <SlexAxton> that as soon as our $.each loops were the bottleneck in our app
[21:19:41] <SlexAxton> we could change them all to for loops
[21:49:42] <sheilablackrose> in an ajax post how can i send multiple data?
[21:49:56] <sheilablackrose> do i do something like data:reuslts1,results2
[21:49:57] <sheilablackrose> ?
[21:50:49] <divxkorea>  data: { value1: '',value2:''
[21:52:23] <sheilablackrose> the itemns i want to post is 2 arrays, results[] and ids[].
[21:52:35] <sheilablackrose>  $.ajaxAntiForgery({
[21:52:35] <sheilablackrose>         url: url,
[21:52:35] <sheilablackrose>         type: "POST",
[21:52:35] <sheilablackrose>         data: flagData,
[21:52:49] <sheilablackrose> i replace flagdata with {results,ids},
[21:52:50] <sheilablackrose> ?
[21:55:51] <coldhead> {results: results, ids: ids}
[21:56:01] <coldhead> an object has keys and values
[21:56:18] <coldhead> maybe {"results": results, "ids": ids} makes it clearer
[21:56:36] <sheilablackrose> ok
[21:59:38] <coldhead> i'm really going to miss you guys when the world ends
[22:04:21] <sheilablackrose> i get an undefinederror
[22:04:22] <sheilablackrose> data: { "results": results, "flagsIds": flagsIds },
[22:04:36] <sheilablackrose> ReferenceError: flagsIds is not defined
[22:04:48] <jacoluta> if(worldends == tomrrow) { console.log("UHOH"); }
[22:05:00] <jacoluta> if(worldends == tomorrow) { console.log("UHOH"); }
[22:05:45] <jacoluta> as long as I can code after it ends, I guess it's all good
[22:06:16] <sheilablackrose> oh got it
[22:06:17] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[22:14:00] <quijote> Hi folks. I am a jquery (and javascript newbie) I have a simple question (i think). I woundering if someone might help me out
[22:14:15] <quijote> why can't I use "this" here
[22:14:17] <quijote>  $(".level2 li").click(function () {
[22:14:34] <quijote> $(".level2 li").click(function () {
[22:15:25] <jacoluta> quijote: inside the functino?
[22:15:35] <quijote> yeah
[22:15:38] <jacoluta> you can
[22:15:42] <jacoluta> $(this)
[22:15:47] <quijote> ahh
[22:16:08] <quijote> Sweet thanks
[22:16:10] <jacoluta> using just 'this'
[22:16:15] <jacoluta> wont reference the object
[22:16:22] <jacoluta> so u need $(this)
[22:16:29] <quijote> it thinks its a variable?
[22:16:54] <jacoluta> no... 'this' is basically equal to $(this)
[22:16:59] <jacoluta> yea
[22:17:02] <jacoluta> go with that
[22:17:07] <jacoluta> i thinks its a variable
[22:19:30] <jacoluta> this without $() basically has nothing to do with jQuery thats Y
[22:21:04] <divxkorea> hey guys..
[22:21:09] <tw2113> and gals
[22:21:33] <quijote> jacoluta thanks!
[22:22:30] <divxkorea> I try to used fanybox.
[22:22:36] <divxkorea> I'd like to get in some transport fancybox parmeter option should you use?
[22:22:47] <divxkorea>   $.fancybox.open({
[22:52:39] <nemothekid> Wondering if anyone could help me out with this use case. I have an app that loads data points from a server, something like /data/start=timestamp&end=tz&user=mike. What I would like to do is be able to pass an array to the user variable. I thought about using a hash code like /data/12345 and sending the data through a JSON object. However you can't send JSON through a GET request. I can't switch to POST or else my request won't be
[22:52:40] <nemothekid> cached. Has anyone tackled this before? I'd be interested in what an efficient/standard solution might be
[23:03:33] <quijote> jaco
[23:04:05] <quijote> jacoluta can I ask you another question related to $(this)
[23:04:33] <jacoluta> quijote: go for it
[23:04:57] <quijote> $(this ".classname").hide();
[23:05:01] <quijote> why wont that work
[23:05:22] <lasha> what are you trying to do
[23:05:27] <rakl> why do you have to say this
[23:05:35] <vladikoff> nemothekid, $.get("/data", { 'user[]': ["mike", "coldhead"], 'end': 'tz'} );​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
[23:06:14] <quijote> jacoluta $(this ".classname").hide(); why wont this work?
[23:06:36] <jacoluta> quijote: jsut reference the class name
[23:06:44] <jacoluta> $('.classname')
[23:07:05] <nemothekid> vladikoff: I am aware of that method, however lets say you had 20 users, would it still be sane to do it that way?
[23:07:46] <quijote> jacoluta what I need is $(this "ul)
[23:07:52] <quijote> missed that last quote
[23:08:55] <vladikoff> quijote, try $(this).add('ul').hide();
[23:09:57] <quijote> jacoluta, cool! I am reading the add function. Loosklike this hsould work thanks
[23:10:37] <vladikoff> nemothekid, well if you want to use GET, you have to make complex GET requests, such as one with 20 users in it
[23:11:36] <nemothekid> c'est la vie I suppose thanks for the help
[23:46:13] <fabioportieri> morning
[23:47:21] <lasha> anyone know the rendering resolution of the iPhone 5?
[23:47:43] <lasha> i know width is 320px since it didn't get any wider
[23:47:47] <lasha> but what about the height
[23:54:19] <trinadh> lasha: display resolution?
[23:54:37] <lasha> not display, but the rendering resolution of the page inside safari
[23:55:14] <lasha> for example, on iPhone 4 and 4S, the rendering resolution is still 320px width and 480px height (or whatever the height is minus navbar)
[23:55:41] <lasha> just wanna know what the RENDERED height is in PIXELS for the new iphone 5 because of the taller screen
[23:55:49] <lasha> i'm trying to write some media queries to target for it.
[23:57:28] <lasha> i need to update my xcode so i can hopefully get the iphone 5 simulator
[23:57:34] <lasha> and then i can just do a test
[23:57:41] <lasha> with javascript and see the returned value.
