[08:34:17] <Guest57986> Hey all
[08:34:45] <V7> Hey all
[08:35:16] <V7> Is it possible to get onlt text from multi elemented element, but preserve images ?
[08:35:31] <V7> For example, $( el ).text( ) gives it, but removes images
[08:35:42] <V7> Is it possible to set some filter to it ?
[08:36:08] <V7> Or it's only possible to remove <img> tags before text() ?
[08:44:20] <V7> For example: http://jsfiddle.net/Lxxtuafq/
[08:44:36] <V7> Is it possible to get from text only text, links and images ?
[08:48:22] <V7> As you could see iamges gone: http://jsfiddle.net/Lxxtuafq/1
[09:12:37] <tilerendering> oh man, I feel like a total loserâ€¦ trying to make a jquery datatable display the same rows  when adding new rows: it s got a vertical scrollbar, and when I scroll down, and add new rows to the very top of the table, I want the currently viewable portion of the table stay unchanged
[09:12:47] <tilerendering> I spent like .. a day on this already
[11:46:23] <L0g4nAd4ms> i have an event "mouse down" handler in a function that handles playerInput. The function has a paremeter `colorsArray` which represents a sequence of colors he has to click. So when the game is over and the array gets updated and i call my handle player input function with the updated parameter again it does not really get updated in event handler.
[11:46:39] <L0g4nAd4ms> it still is the array from the last round

[14:09:27] <jsnewbie245> i found the problem, check_callback must be true for create_callback to work
