[04:13:02] <Northwoods> Can anyone suggest a good auto-suggest which has feature to must-select-from-list
[04:23:48] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods huh?
[04:24:07] <robertmaxrees> Like - it suggests from predetermined options?
[04:26:38] <rindolf> hi all! This commit which attempts to replace .setTimeout with .change(...) breaks "gmake upload browser-tests" which uses qunit-puppeteer. how can i fix it?
[04:29:35] <robertmaxrees> rindolf gonna need more details.  how does it break them?  what's the commit?  what is that gmake command doing?
[04:32:35] <rindolf> hi all! This commit which attempts to replace .setTimeout with .change(...) breaks "gmake upload browser-tests" which uses qunit-puppeteer. https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/commit/5c2adec3b676559a63c3e7ffe0143f43beba8603 . It causes qunit-puppetteer to stall (can be aborted using ctrl+c). the gmake command compiles the typescript to js and uploads it to https://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/text/gui-tests.xhtml . how can
[04:32:35] <rindolf> i fix it?
[04:34:24] <robertmaxrees> rindolf where do you fire the change event?
[04:35:34] <robertmaxrees> you bind some event listeners and then do nothing.  that's why it "stalls".
[04:38:23] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i modify the .val() here: https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/master/fc-solve/site/wml/src/ts/web-fc-solve-ui.ts
[04:47:03] <robertmaxrees> where do you fire the change event in the test?
[05:01:58] * Cork suspect the answer "is it doesn't"
[05:09:51] <undefined_bob> hello Cork :) are you doing alright?
[05:10:05] <Cork> yup
[05:10:11] <Cork> your self?
[05:11:48] <undefined_bob> glad to hear that
[05:12:00] <undefined_bob> yes, thanks. I'm fine too, just a bit tired
[05:12:19] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i use .val(new_val) here - shouldn't it count: https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/c8f8063236c28d5e7dc62d41cd12974e1250deda/fc-solve/site/wml/src/ts/fcs-base-ui.ts#L34 ?
[05:12:56] <robertmaxrees> rindolf in the test you never fire the change event.
[05:15:54] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i simulate a button click which eventually changes the value
[05:16:13] <robertmaxrees> changing the value via jquery != firing the change event :)
[05:18:33] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i see
[05:19:41] <robertmaxrees> rindolf see https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/24u1Ldva/
[05:20:08] <robertmaxrees> need to add a .trigger('change')
[05:20:32] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i see the note here: https://api.jquery.com/change/
[05:20:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[05:22:20] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: so i need to add it in the production code?
[05:22:35] <robertmaxrees> "the production code"??
[05:22:42] <robertmaxrees> probably just in your test.
[05:23:09] <robertmaxrees> you change the value and then nothing.  trying .trigger('change') after you set the val() in the test.
[05:45:23] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: the production code which is also used in the interactive web ui here: https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/ (which is intended for human users) changes the value
[05:52:25] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: i added some .trigger('change') there for now
[05:52:54] <Cork> rindolf: the point made is that .val() is not the same as user input, when a user modifies form elements the browser fires events
[05:52:54] * rindolf is moving to a different computer - see ya
[05:53:08] <Cork> this doesn't happen when you change the value from code, then you have to trigger ...
[06:05:01] <rindolf> hi all, thanks again!
[06:23:13] <rindolf> "make upload browser-tests" works fine now, and now no ".setTimeout" are harmed^W used
[08:09:52] <gulzar> Hi. I am trying to use jquery autocomplete. I got this code https://jsfiddle.net/ogm80k4u/4/ , The limit for multiple inputs I need is 2. How to set input liimit? terms is the array but can't figure out how to stop adding
[09:42:27] <newJquerier> hello
[22:16:34] <TMC> Hi
[22:16:52] <robertmaxrees> hello
[22:19:55] <TMC> robertmaxrees i have problem collapsed using ajax
[22:20:29] <robertmaxrees> OK.
[22:20:48] <robertmaxrees> just share the code and ask the question, yo
[22:29:03] <robertmaxrees> Welp
[22:32:21] <TMC> ok
[22:33:46] <snackoverflow> how can I load scratch_tab dynamically with vextab? https://jsfiddle.net/m4ka508h/
[22:34:14] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/0x6uw984/1/
[22:34:44] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow you know what i'm gonna tell you lol.
[22:35:19] <robertmaxrees> TMC what's the rendered code that the browser actually sees?
[22:35:28] <robertmaxrees> TMC that looks like server-side templating of some kind.
[22:35:43] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: no, i don't
[22:36:03] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow that's a vextab question, not jquery :)
[22:36:31] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: vextab is a javascript lib
[22:36:38] <robertmaxrees> i see.
[22:36:55] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that has to do with what i just said lol.
[22:37:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd go check their docs and go from there.
[22:38:55] <TMC> problem @ajax.beginform
[22:39:03] <TMC> item no clicked
[22:39:17] <robertmaxrees> TMC yeah, that looks like some kind of server-side thing, no?
[22:39:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, ASP.  TMC that's not jquery either lol.
[22:40:20] <robertmaxrees> rather, it might use jquery, but really you want to ask in an ASP.NET spot.  not here.
[22:46:35] <TMC> ok :(
[22:46:58] <robertmaxrees> TMC I say that because i'd need to see the generated code that the browser actually gets to be able to help at all :)
