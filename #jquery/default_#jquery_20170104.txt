[00:55:13] <WhirledPress> if I listen for a click on a link and stop propagation of the click event, can I use the target atttribute to store the ID of element I want to load content into?
[00:55:52] <WhirledPress> or is the target attribute only allowed to be the normal values like "blank", "self","parent"...?
[00:56:44] <WhirledPress> <a href="someurl" target='container_7'>something</a>
[03:25:56] <Ziberius> hello
[03:26:34] <Ziberius> I have a close for a div with position fixed which does a fadeOut
[03:26:50] <Ziberius> when doing so the page scrolls to the top, is there a way to avoid this?
[04:28:32] <Andr3as> good morning everyone.. i try to extract certain values from a table into arrays.. this is working good for non number inputs, but fails for number inputs... i have a jsfiddle.. https://jsfiddle.net/y2rhef09/3/ - has someone maybe an idea what i am doing wrong?
[06:35:58] <RafaelSa> Hello all, I just faced this error in jQuery, but I'm not sure if it's a bug
[06:36:00] <RafaelSa> https://jsfiddle.net/uvme0f0L/10/
[06:49:37] <dglambert> morning
[07:08:15] <jakeee> Hey guys anyone able to answer a query regarding jquerymobiles ajax system for loading between link clicks
[07:09:40] <jakeee> My page with ajax disabled works as intended, javascript functions on button click etc, but with ajax enabled, the page fetches but the button function will not trigger
[08:54:36] <patrickk> has anyone here tried creating a parallax scrolling page using scrollmagic or skrollr, I noticed the scroll animations are relatively faster in both of them, is there a way to make it slower?
[08:56:30] <mazula> Hi ! How I can get all urls from this page ? http://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=236165230&damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&scopeId=C&isSearchRequest=true&pageNumber=1
[08:57:14] <mazula> I need to use jquery to do that
[08:58:07] <patrickk> mazula: .attr('href);
[08:59:43] <mazula> hmm and if I need only the thumbs urls ?
[08:59:51] <patrickk> thumb urls?
[09:00:00] <patrickk> well target that element and get the src
[09:00:32] <mazula> This one will have to create a table variable "thumbs" and push in the table all the urls of the thumbs of this
[09:00:52] <patrickk> By url, i am talking about a webpage, if you want the src of an image, then use .getAttribute("src")
[09:02:18] <mazula> thank you :)
[09:30:08] <mazula> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8814b7c5721df15682c088bcf02fd215 How I can debug this code ? :)
[09:54:52] <prillian5> is there a plguin, which fix browsers with missing setCustomValidity support ?
[11:08:43] <ExeciN> how can I make the jQuery.ajax equivalent of the html version as seen here? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/54868f6be65075cffdab980c6fcc9d51 I can't get the file upload to work.
[11:10:00] <taplar> a file upload is not data type json
[11:12:23] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/scripts/src/workspaceService.js <-- there is some abstraction going on, but take a look at line 939
[11:16:32] <ExeciN> the reply is of json
[11:16:45] <ExeciN> oh I get it now
[11:25:12] <ExeciN> taplar: could you give me a glimpse of #newfile ?
[11:25:50] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/views/newFile.view
[11:26:05] <ExeciN> taplar: thanks
[11:26:21] <mazula> I try to create a scraper but I have an problem, an idea ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8814b7c5721df15682c088bcf02fd215
[11:27:29] <taplar> your getting a CORS error.  the destination server does not allow ajax requests from your source server
[11:28:09] <mazula> :/
[11:30:40] <tomasm-> hey is there a way to have jQuery.extend() understand dot-syntax for nested elements? ie instead of "foo: { bar: { bin: ... } } }" do "foo.bar.bin: ..." ?
[11:31:19] <ExeciN> taplar: your input is type="text"
[11:31:28] <ExeciN> mine is type="file"
[11:31:37] <taplar> oh crap
[11:31:39] <taplar> hold on
[11:31:57] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/views/uploadFile.view
[11:32:48] <taplar> tomasm-: foo: { bar: { bin: ... }} is creating an object.  foo.bar.bin is invalid javascript unless bar already exists on foo
[11:33:28] <tomasm-> taplar, I _understand_ it's not going to work out of the box, just _fantasizing_ there's some utility that will do what i'm looking for
[11:33:45] <taplar> no, you're talking about a language thing
[11:33:58] <taplar> javascript, not jQuery
[11:43:04] <patrickk> is it safe to use smooth scroll plugin on a parallax page?
[12:17:55] <taplar> ooooh, standing desks sux
[12:19:29] <newbie00007> I'm getting an error that data.sort is not a function.  My ajax is returning an array of objects.  http://kopy.io/kUyN3#I7F2DtIEPrsat2
[12:20:12] <taplar> $buildings is a deferred
[12:20:43] <taplar> getJSON is asynchronous.  it doesn't return in a procedural manner
[12:22:10] <newbie00007> Okay.  So do I need to do my sort inside the ajax call?
[12:22:27] <taplar> in some callback off of the deferred, yes
[12:26:29] <newbie00007> taplar okay so I'm sorting the data in the function(json){} but it's not sorting it at all.  :(
[12:26:49] <taplar> why do you say that?
[12:27:58] <newbie00007> I'm an idiot.  I did a n instead of N
[12:28:01] <newbie00007> Oops
[12:32:50] <newbie00007> taplar since getJSON is asynchronous what would you recommend for me to use so I can use my $buildings array to populate 3 dropdowns?
[12:33:32] <taplar> you just have to do whatever logic you want to do with the returned data within, or originating from, one of the deferred callback methods
[12:34:35] <taplar> you can still use it to build those dropdowns.  the issue is that since it is asynchronous, after you make the call the data will not be reliably available for procedural logic after it
[12:35:00] <taplar> putting the logic in a callback method ensures that the data is available at that time, as it was given to the callback
[12:35:08] <newbie00007> okay.  So I could use the .done to populate it.
[12:35:13] <taplar> yep
[12:35:20] <newbie00007> Awesome.  Thanks again
[12:53:52] <WhirledPress> if I have an element with a data-prefixed attribute, I can access that in jquery using var data=$(el).data("suffix") but nothing is stored in the data-prefixed property on the element when I use $(el).data("suffix","something"); Is this correct?
[12:54:35] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:54:51] <duch_kazatel> .data() caches data-* attributes and doesn't modify them.
[12:55:28] <WhirledPress> so to update the data-* attributes, I would have to use $(el).prop("data-*",val)  ?
[12:55:50] <duch_kazatel> back up - why do you think you need that?
[12:55:51] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:56:07] <WhirledPress> I am trying to head off a problem with scope
[12:56:19] <duch_kazatel> .prop() vs .data() won't solve that.
[12:56:21] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[12:56:48] <WhirledPress> perhaps you could suggest a good book about how to create js objects
[12:56:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:57:11] <duch_kazatel> scope and objects are related but not the same topic.
[12:57:35] <WhirledPress> I am trying to force behaviors on elements using data- attributes
[12:57:47] <duch_kazatel> define "behaviors"
[12:57:53] <taplar> css behaviors?
[12:57:55] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to bind event listeners?
[12:58:12] <WhirledPress> I have five images, for example that each have different animation transitions
[12:58:55] <WhirledPress> and those can be set from an admin interface that generates the elements in php
[12:59:16] <duch_kazatel> give them a shared class that dictates the core "animate" behavior.  data elements specify which specific effect they get.
[12:59:26] <duch_kazatel> that's one way.
[13:00:23] <WhirledPress> lemme put a fiddle up. Thanks tons for your help.
[13:00:48] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost but okay.
[13:02:24] <taplar> i'm interested in seeing the scope issue
[13:02:44] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[13:03:38] <duch_kazatel> that + the question about "[...] book about how to create js objects" plus this thing about "behaviors" makes this seem really X Yish
[13:12:56] <persina> How do I do this if the src attribute is a variable? $('#test').empty().append('<img src="/static/on.png" height="64px" width="64px">');
[13:13:11] <duch_kazatel> string concat
[13:13:16] <duch_kazatel> .append('
[13:13:16] <duch_kazatel> <img src="/static/on.png" height="64px" width="64px">');
[13:13:19] <duch_kazatel> woops 1 sec.
[13:13:42] <duch_kazatel> .append('<img src="' + foo + '">');
[13:14:42] <persina> duch_kazatel: Thanks! But why doesn't it work like .append('<img src="'foo'">');?
[13:14:53] <persina> why do I need the +'s?
[13:15:03] <duch_kazatel> because that's how you concatenate strings.
[13:15:27] <persina> duch_kazatel: No autoboxing?
[13:15:39] <duch_kazatel> it'
[13:15:44] <duch_kazatel> *it's not java ;)
[13:17:17] <taplar> es6 allows string interpolation
[13:17:42] <duch_kazatel> you mean template literals?
[13:17:44] <taplar> similar to php and groovy, and probably other languages
[13:17:53] <taplar> http://es6-features.org/#StringInterpolation
[13:18:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, template literals.
[13:18:32] <duch_kazatel> not the same, but anopther way to approach.
[13:18:50] <duch_kazatel> and also assumes support for es2015 :)
[13:45:45] <duch_kazatel> WhirledPress you still there buddy?
[13:50:33] <gumbero> hi, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yke0v9e8/6/ <-- with firefox, clicking onto "show dialog", searching for "text2" to jump down and then clicking on the link doesn't trigger the click-event. if you scroll down with the mouse, the click-event is triggered just fine. any idea why/how?
[13:50:42] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:50:56] <gumbero> yeah sorry, didn't find any solution yet :)
[13:51:00] <duch_kazatel> in the words of admiral ackbar...
[13:54:01] <duch_kazatel> fwiw that's working for me.
[13:54:43] <taplar> i hate my network today
[13:55:19] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#entry-longdesc gumbero
[13:55:23] <duch_kazatel> read that bit on "focus"
[14:05:16] <taplar> I wish that one guy in the matrix could have shapeshifted.  Then we could have called him polymorpheous
[14:09:19] <newbie00007> I'm making a form and I'm wanting to use a data attribute to toggle a class on fields.  How would I target data-conditional ?  Can I have multiple values in the data-attribute that jquery can look through?
[14:09:34] <duch_kazatel> back waaaaaaaay up
[14:09:41] <duch_kazatel> and make a fiddle.
[14:09:41] <newbie00007> Okay
[14:09:48] <duch_kazatel> because that question is really unusual.
[14:10:05] <newbie00007> Okay.  If there is a better way, I'm all for it.
[14:10:31] <duch_kazatel> gotta fiddle showing what you're thinking?
[14:10:53] <newbie00007> I'm putting it together right now.  Give me 3 minutes.
[14:10:56] <duch_kazatel> awesome.
[14:16:47] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/7dn1wL8k/
[14:17:29] <duch_kazatel> alright.
[14:17:33] <newbie00007> If Option 1 is selected I want to toggle the hidden class on any item that has data-condition = 1; If 2 toggle data-condition = 2
[14:18:08] <newbie00007> I was also wondering if it is possible to have data-condition="1, 2" and if either number exists toggle the class.
[14:18:08] <duch_kazatel> why not use classes instead?
[14:18:46] <newbie00007> I assumed I would only use a class if it was applying styling. That's why I chose the data attribute.
[14:19:01] <duch_kazatel> would or could?
[14:19:08] <duch_kazatel> because classes are valid for JS, too.
[14:19:22] <duch_kazatel> the issue is data attributes sucks for selecting.
[14:19:56] <newbie00007> I know I can use classes in JS.  Okay.  I didn't realize that about them.  I can just add classes.
[14:21:00] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you can .filter() for data attributes if you really want, but it sounds like you have groups of things you'd like to apply styling to.
[14:21:33] <newbie00007> Well I have a few dropdowns and what fields appear are based on what is selected in each one.
[14:21:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:21:48] <duch_kazatel> you have groups of things you want to hide/show.
[14:21:54] <newbie00007> Yeah.
[14:22:32] <duch_kazatel> hiding/showing is something you often achieve by using styles - that could be done via adding/removing classes.
[14:24:27] <newbie00007> Okay.  I made a change.  What did I do wrong when checking for the class?  https://jsfiddle.net/7dn1wL8k/1/
[14:24:49] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:24:54] <duch_kazatel> "1' is a terrible classname.
[14:24:57] <duch_kazatel> but fair enough
[14:25:02] <Jabo-> hello does anyone know how to make the ui-content div full height in jquery mobile? red box on this page http://herperfect.com/3.php
[14:25:22] <duch_kazatel> newbie00007 also: look at your console.
[14:25:33] <newbie00007> well it will change once I have the concept down.  I haven't narrowed down what the values will actually be.  I'm just trying to prove proof of concept to the person asking for this.
[14:25:53] <duch_kazatel> open your console and you'll see the issue.
[14:26:00] <newbie00007> I see it now
[14:26:02] <newbie00007> Thanks
[14:26:56] <newbie00007> I had it close.  Just the wrong order.  :)
[14:27:02] <duch_kazatel> heh
[14:27:47] <newbie00007> In your opinion would you just have the box appear or would you do an animation to ease it in?
[14:27:59] <duch_kazatel> really depends.
[14:28:18] <newbie00007> Cuz there can upwards of 10 items appearing on the page for a single dropdown answer.
[14:28:29] <duch_kazatel> again, really depends.
[14:28:31] <duch_kazatel> heh
[14:32:28] <Jabo-> http://herperfect.com/4.php doesnt seem to work :/
[14:32:48] <duch_kazatel> Jabo- do you have a fiddle or something we can edit.
[14:37:29] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: what am I missing on this part? https://jsfiddle.net/7dn1wL8k/2/
[14:37:46] <duch_kazatel> ask specific questions pls
[14:37:48] <newbie00007> I can't for the life of me to get it to slide down
[14:38:06] <duch_kazatel> first off.
[14:38:12] <duch_kazatel> you don't need an .each()
[14:38:17] <Question> Hello, need code. If checkbox is checked do equations that sum would be added to var tot .   if(document.getElementById('more20').checked) {      tot+=200*4 ;     }
[14:38:38] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: won't I need that to go through each form-group that will have the 1 2 classes on them
[14:39:11] <duch_kazatel> you just select those directly instead.
[14:39:48] <newbie00007> So I would do a $('.2'). do whatever and it will do it to all the items that have that class?
[14:40:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd do $('.form-group.2') personally.
[14:42:26] <duch_kazatel> newbie00007 like this https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7dn1wL8k/3/
[14:42:41] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: thanks for that.  a few less lines of code now.  :)
[14:43:00] <duch_kazatel> the .each() is generally done for you in most jquery methods.
[14:43:23] <newbie00007> awesine
[14:43:28] <newbie00007> awesome
[14:43:42] <newbie00007> evidently I'm having issues between brain and keyboard now
[14:43:59] <newbie00007> is there any way to make the slide in smooth/
[14:44:01] <newbie00007> ?
[14:44:06] <newbie00007> It's still pretty abrupt
[14:44:16] <duch_kazatel> you're wrestling with bootstrap i'm going to guess.
[14:44:20] <duch_kazatel> see if it's got anything.
[14:44:37] <newbie00007> will do
[14:55:30] <gumbero> duch_kazatel: thanks for the link. unfortunately i don't really understand completely the connection of it and my problem. although those items are handled special in the dialog i don't understand why jumping down with searching causes the problem.
[14:56:22] <duch_kazatel> because your problem has to do with how the dialog hijacks focus.
[14:56:30] <duch_kazatel> at least that's my guess.
[14:57:05] <gumbero> thanks :)
[14:57:23] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest testing that idea out.
[14:58:11] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: Okay this might be a dumb question.  If someone changes the dropdown, how can I toggle the class on the old items?  Here is my updated code.  https://jsfiddle.net/7dn1wL8k/4/
[14:58:27] <duch_kazatel> "toggle class"?
[14:58:38] <duch_kazatel> you mean remove "in" from all those that have it?
[14:58:44] <newbie00007> Yes.
[14:58:48] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:58:51] <newbie00007> Nevermind.
[14:58:55] <duch_kazatel> :D
[14:58:57] <newbie00007> Now you say it that way, I figured it out
[14:59:01] <duch_kazatel> heh
[14:59:10] <newbie00007> I've got serious brain to finger issues today.
[14:59:16] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good.
[14:59:31] <duch_kazatel> some of this just comes from practice.
[14:59:56] <newbie00007> I don't use jquery at all really so this is a lot of learning for me today.
[15:00:17] <duch_kazatel> fwiw there's a learn.jquery.com and a try.jquery.com
[15:00:31] <gumbero> duch_kazatel: doesn't seem like i could disable the keyboard navigation
[15:00:44] <duch_kazatel> gumbero nor am i suggesting that you should.
[15:00:52] <newbie00007> I have every intention to look at them but here lately I have been so busy at work that I haven't gotten to look at them.
[15:01:26] <gumbero> duch_kazatel: ok, that was the first thing regarding testing, which came to my mind. if you can suggest other approaches i'll be happy to try
[15:01:44] <duch_kazatel> try stopping the dialog from stealing focus.
[15:03:37] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: how does my code look now? https://jsfiddle.net/7dn1wL8k/5/
[15:04:15] <newbie00007> I had to add the .not() for those items that are shared between different options.
[15:04:31] <duch_kazatel> i was about to ask.
[15:04:35] <duch_kazatel> 2 things though.
[15:04:40] <newbie00007> Okay.
[15:04:50] <duch_kazatel> actually three.
[15:05:02] <duch_kazatel> 1: you're missing a var declaration, 2: why no whitespace on some lines?
[15:05:10] <newbie00007> Hey, you already said 2.  You can't add a 3rd now.
[15:05:27] <duch_kazatel> and 3: store things in vars and re-use them later.
[15:05:59] <newbie00007> What am I missing a var on?  $requestType ?
[15:06:03] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:06:27] <newbie00007> What do you mean by no whitespace on some lines?
[15:06:43] <duch_kazatel> or almost none.  like around your curlies.
[15:06:54] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7dn1wL8k/6/
[15:07:22] <newbie00007> Oh that's from me being lazy on jfiddle.  The IDE i use automatically adds them.
[15:07:38] <duch_kazatel> heh jsfiddle's "tidy" does that automatically too ;)
[15:07:56] <newbie00007> Ahhh.  Your robertmaxrees ?
[15:08:00] <duch_kazatel> si.
[15:08:09] <newbie00007> Different name threw me off.
[15:08:23] <newbie00007> You helped me like 8 months back with another issue I was having.
[15:08:27] <duch_kazatel> awesome.
[15:08:38] <newbie00007> Not on my home machine so I'm not logged into my normal IRC name.
[15:13:41] <newbie00007> duch_kazatel: thanks for all the help
[15:14:02] <gumbero> duch_kazatel: thanks for the hint, solved it by adding this line: "$.ui.dialog.prototype._focusTabbable = function(){};" :D
[15:21:43] <WhirledPress> nothing like getting completely sidetracked while trying to create a test case...
[15:29:08] <WhirledPress> I am having the hardest time trying to describe this: I have nested elements that animate their visiblity when a link is clicked.
[15:32:20] <taplar> what do you mean they are nested?
[15:35:05] <taplar> more specifically, what implication are you trying to express by saying they are nested?
[15:53:03] <WhirledPress> sorry, here is the fiddle I was trying to setup...https://jsfiddle.net/k2opy8o6/1/
[15:53:37] <WhirledPress> ignore the html and css parts. It's the recursive logic  I am having a hard time with
[15:56:40] <taplar> links that use hashes for navigation are not concerned with nesting.
[15:57:00] <taplar> they just go to the element they find in the dom
[15:57:01] <WhirledPress> I am stopping the default action
[15:57:19] <taplar> ok?  the id is still unique to the page
[15:57:39] <WhirledPress> sure, that's how I select the item that I want to active
[15:58:14] <taplar> sure, so you click a link, you stop the event, find the element by the id from the hash, and then you do something with it
[15:58:27] <WhirledPress> That's the easy part
[15:58:41] <taplar> so tell me the hard part
[15:59:04] <WhirledPress> using my example, if I click a.4 to activate, and b.3 is active, I only need to animate a and b
[15:59:39] <taplar> what are you calling 'a.4'?
[15:59:54] <WhirledPress> An element called 4 is a child of A
[16:00:30] <WhirledPress> but it could be a.4.d   and the logic  is the same.
[16:00:49] <taplar> i'm looking at your markup.  what would be an a.4, or an a.1 ?
[16:01:09] <WhirledPress> if the footer_content element, there are 3 footer panel elements
[16:01:28] <taplar> sure
[16:01:32] <WhirledPress> inside one of the footer_pnl elements is a bunch of social panel elements
[16:01:54] <taplar> k
[16:02:03] <WhirledPress> If I am looking at copyright info (footer_content.site-legal) and click twitter
[16:02:22] <WhirledPress> it should animate out the copyright panel and animate in the social panel...twitter should be active
[16:03:00] <WhirledPress> then if I click facebook, no need to animate the social pane (twitters parent), just animate out twitter and in facebook
[16:03:04] <taplar> ok, so you have links to the sub areas
[16:03:28] <taplar> you want to animate in the sub area, it's a parent, and unanimate any other things that were active?
[16:03:45] <WhirledPress> at any level, yes
[16:04:07] <WhirledPress> none of the sublevels need animating if the main level is not active
[16:04:28] <WhirledPress> you just set the sublevels to active, animate the main levbel
[16:05:02] <taplar> the main level is the parent of the sub level, or the top most parent?
[16:05:14] <WhirledPress> brb  I'll fix the markup so I am making more sense...thanks for your help...
[16:16:47] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/k2opy8o6/4/
[16:18:52] <taplar> alright so, if you click for porche, trucks should be unanimated and cars and porche should be animated?
[16:19:11] <WhirledPress> cars should be animated with porche selected already
[16:20:49] <taplar> ok, so what i would probably do is put a class on cars and trucks, such as 'vehicles' or 'options' or something
[16:21:19] <taplar> then, when you find the element that should be activated you can do closest('.vehicles') or whatever to find it's top parent
[16:21:41] <taplar> unanimate any other vehicles that are not that one, and then you have the vehicle you need to animate
[16:22:15] <taplar> brb
[16:23:43] <WhirledPress> thanks. Here is a more thorough example of the problem. https://jsfiddle.net/k2opy8o6/5/
[16:29:53] <taplar> so did you understand my suggestion?
[16:33:11] <WhirledPress> That is only one level of the hierarchy. If it was that simple, I could easily do it. The problem is that it could be nested deep like "Jeep" is inside "GMc" inside "trucks"   There has got to be a recursive way to handle this
[16:33:35] <taplar> if you activate jeep what should happen?
[16:34:23] <WhirledPress> Starting from jeep, move up the hierarchy. If jeeps parent's peers are active, then we need to animate heeps parent
[16:35:28] <WhirledPress> If there are no active elements in the heirarchy, set the elements in the hierarchy to active and just animate the top element..
[16:35:42] <WhirledPress> I can get close, but not quite there.brb
[16:37:56] <taplar> so is the issue with determining if the parents are already active or not?
[16:38:08] <taplar> i'm having trouble visualizing the two different paths
[16:38:21] <taplar> i get the nothing is active path
[16:45:53] <WhirledPress> Sorry, I was struggling with jsfiddle. Here it is in codepen. http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/YNPqXo?editors=1111
[16:46:27] <WhirledPress> If you activate an element that does not have any ancestors active, there is no need to animate it.
[16:47:22] <taplar> set self to active; if (no parents are active) { activate all and animate top } else { do nothing }
[16:47:23] <taplar> ?
[16:48:29] <WhirledPress> Setting an item to active just adds the active class (makes it visible,etc.) but if it's parent's aren't active, it doesn't help if the child is visible
[16:49:00] <taplar> so that pseudocode is wrong?
[16:49:50] <WhirledPress> If none of the parents are active, then set all of the heirarchy to active, but animate the topmost element.
[16:50:05] <taplar> that's what that says
[16:50:27] <WhirledPress> because presumably if any elements are active, there will be a shared active element up the chain
[16:51:33] <WhirledPress> What I don't want is to animate the great grandchildren, then the grandchildren, then the children, then the parents just to show the topmost. Skip all those animations and just animate the top most
[16:51:52] <taplar> right, which you said that adding active doesn't animate
[16:51:59] <taplar> it just makes them visible
[16:52:27] * hlve slaps taplar with a trout.
[16:53:30] <hlve> WhirledPress, the fact that you refer to your elements the same way you do your family tree... :)))
[16:57:44] <duch_kazatel> boooomshakalaka
[16:58:41] * Captain_Ramius starts having 90s flashbacks.
[17:11:05] <WhirledPress> hive, was there a verb in that?
[17:11:52] <WhirledPress> taplar, thanks for your help. I'm not sure why this is so hard to describe. You have been very patient, I appreciate it.
[17:12:31] <WhirledPress> hive, in my family tree, I got cousins that are aunts---it ain't pretty down here in the South.
[17:14:55] <Arcarc> I have an object where, if I do console.log(), it returns "Object {}"
[17:14:58] <Arcarc> It should return "Object {0: Object, 1: Object, 2: Object}"
[17:15:15] <Arcarc> But when I open the data, it looks identical (but can't be accessed as it should)
[17:15:20] <Arcarc> What's the likely problem?
[17:15:29] <duch_kazatel> are you instantiating it using new or something?
[17:15:33] <duch_kazatel> or via ajax?
[17:16:15] <Arcarc> I have:
[17:16:17] <Arcarc> var lights = {};
[17:16:22] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle please.
[17:16:23] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:16:29] <Arcarc> It's so little code
[17:16:31] <Arcarc> But okay
[17:16:39] <duch_kazatel> great!  easy to make a test case :D
[17:17:29] <Arcarc> Not sure you need to test it, probably ajax being spooky since you explicitly mentioned it
[17:17:34] <Arcarc> But here's the paste: http://pastebin.com/0DvSZx8L
[17:17:42] <Arcarc> Tell me if you need more
[17:17:48] <duch_kazatel> nope, it's the ajax.
[17:17:54] <duch_kazatel> you're logging the object before it's populated.
[17:18:00] <duch_kazatel> you can't return data from ajax calls like that.
[17:18:09] <duch_kazatel> you could return the prmomise.
[17:18:14] <duch_kazatel> but not the data itself.
[17:19:31] <Arcarc> I don't know much about ajax, but why is the object not populated due to ajax?
[17:19:55] <duch_kazatel> because the console.log runs BEFORE the ajax call finishes.
[17:20:00] <duch_kazatel> the object populates, but not in time.
[17:20:01] <Arcarc> Ahhh
[17:20:10] <Arcarc> That sense-makes
[17:22:21] <Arcarc> Wait, so how do I make the function return the populated lights?
[17:22:39] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[17:22:50] <duch_kazatel> you have 2 choces
[17:23:16] <duch_kazatel> 1: run that login within the success callback or pass back the deferred from the ajax call and use that instead.
[17:24:52] <taplar> WhirledPress: np man
[17:25:04] <taplar> sorry got pulled off for a bit
[17:25:36] <duch_kazatel> p= man
[17:25:58] <Arcarc> duch_kazatel: Alright interesting, thanks for thelp!
[17:26:14] <Arcarc> My fingers somehow concatenated "the help" to "thelp", I like it
[17:26:25] <duch_kazatel> yelcome
[17:26:25] <duch_kazatel> :0
[17:26:30] <Arcarc> :)
[18:39:17] <WhirledPress> ugg. so close: http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/YNPqXo?editors=1111
[18:40:11] <duch_kazatel> gotta question?

[21:50:26] <MarcoH> hi
[21:50:43] <MarcoH> I'd have a short question... and I assume this is the wrong place, but I try it anyways
[21:51:11] <MarcoH> I am just working on a project, where page speed is crucial
[21:51:26] <MarcoH> so I decided using pure vanilla javascript rather than jQuery
[21:52:37] <MarcoH> however, I just stumbled upon a discussion on stackoverflow - it's about adding and removing classes from elements
[21:52:55] <MarcoH> and some people stated, that jQuery would be ways faster than vanilla JS
[21:53:11] <MarcoH> and that these 50-60 KB code of jQuery would not be worth mentioning
[21:53:42] <MarcoH> however, I think that not only the code size of jQuery is important, but also the time the browser (on older and slower computers) needs to work with the code at all
[22:07:34] <Parse>  $('input:checkbox:unchecked').each(function(){                 tot-=parseInt($(this).val());                                   });
[22:07:44] <Parse> this one doesnot work how to define unchecked ?
[22:08:01] <Ziberius> hello
[22:08:04] <Ziberius> I have a close for a div with position fixed which does a fadeOut
[22:08:07] <Ziberius> when doing so the page scrolls to the top, is there a way to avoid this?
[22:44:04] <Darmani> Hi guys! So I have this PSD here and I'm supposed to create a feature where if the user mouses over the little screens at the bottom they zoom in.
[22:44:08] <Darmani> https://snag.gy/ikAB3t.jpg
[22:44:30] <Darmani> But those little screens are part of that whole img. There's no selector for me to latch on to :[
[22:44:36] <Darmani> Is there another way to do it?
[22:45:29] <carpii> jquery area tag hover
[22:45:53] <carpii> ignore that, i was googling
[22:46:46] <carpii> see if this helps .. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6981376/jquery-mouseover-event-on-image-map-area
[22:48:52] <Darmani> Ah okay, so use an HTML area tag and latch unto that
[22:49:09] <carpii> im not sure if thats the best way tbh
[22:49:15] <carpii> but i think its one way that would work at least
[22:50:03] <Darmani> carpii: What's another way?
[22:50:52] <carpii> well transparent absolute positioned divs would be another way, but im no expert
[22:51:05] <carpii> but since nobody else is responding, i thought id throw it out there :p
[22:51:19] <carpii> its not a problem ive had to deal with before
[22:52:05] <Darmani> carpii: no worries lol
[22:52:11] <Darmani> Thanks for the suggestions though ^.^
[22:52:13] <Darmani> My first time too
[22:52:16] <carpii> no probs :)
[22:52:27] <carpii> seems like <area> is perfectly suited to this though
[22:52:35] <carpii> assuming jQuery can get events of rit
[22:52:41] <carpii> for it
[22:54:53] <Darmani> carpii: Yeah that's what I was thinking. I mean I could just use hover right?
[22:55:01] <carpii> i think so yeah
[22:55:12] <carpii> or mouseover/mouseout at a push
[22:55:31] <Darmani> I'll let you know how it goes xP
[22:55:41] <carpii> :)
[23:28:26] <arunkumar413> Is there any library for wiring/plumbing SVG like jsplumb?
[23:31:26] <carpii> how does jsplumb relate to SVG? Seems to be an HTML5 visualisation library
[23:31:57] <carpii> or more than that even
[23:53:45] <Darmani> carpii: Meh it kind of works. It's going to be a little off depending on what size screen you have.
[23:53:58] <Darmani> But the client needs it done by Sunday and I have other tasks to do so >.<
[23:54:03] <carpii> how com?
[23:54:04] <carpii> come
[23:54:15] <carpii> just coordinate rounding on small devices?
[23:54:29] <Darmani> wat
[23:54:39] <carpii> wy would it be off?
[23:54:59] <Darmani> you see that img? https://snag.gy/wNfv7a.jpg
[23:55:07] <carpii> yup
[23:55:19] <carpii> but if the image is scaled, the area ought to tbe too i would have thoguht
[23:55:29] <Darmani> That's minimized to fit into that modal so it's not the full size. So I can't use it's natural coordinates.
[23:55:47] <Darmani> So I had to screenshot and use those coordinates like a fucking savage.
[23:56:12] <carpii> oh ok, so <AREA> uses absolute screen coordinates, and not just coordinates of the image
[23:56:26] <Darmani> carpii: yuuuuuup.
[23:56:35] <carpii> well that sucks :(
[23:56:43] <Darmani> fuck it. I have other things to do lol
[23:56:47] <carpii> hehe
[23:56:53] <carpii> you tried, thats what counts ;-)
[23:57:31] <Darmani> carpii: Exactly I literally had to screenshot my own screen cause whoever made this shitty PSD couldn't be bothered to cut it into pieces.
[23:57:47] <carpii> ugh
[23:58:03] * Darmani bangs head against wall
