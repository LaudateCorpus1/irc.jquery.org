[02:32:40] <CuriousMind> So for my homework I have to incorporate .ajaxError
[02:32:48] <CuriousMind> I would put .ajaxError in my button event listener function because when I click button, .ajaxError always checks for an error correct?
[03:50:03] <hellyeahrefactor> why it is not desirable that create event inside event?
[03:54:19] <dwebber88> hellyeahrefactor example?
[03:55:07] <Uhkis> hellyeahrefactor: you mean event handler?
[03:55:17] <hellyeahrefactor> yes event handler
[03:55:54] <hellyeahrefactor> like a.on('click',function() { b.on('click', function() ..
[03:55:59] <Uhkis> hellyeahrefactor: because you have the potential to create a ton of handlers which can be handled with one
[03:56:34] <hellyeahrefactor> ton of handlers
[03:56:46] <hellyeahrefactor> yes that was my rproblem and i fixed it
[03:56:56] <hellyeahrefactor> but why tons of handlers are created
[03:57:10] <hellyeahrefactor> what is the actual reason of that behaivour?
[03:59:11] <hellyeahrefactor> hmm
[03:59:20] <hellyeahrefactor> my question may not make sense
[04:04:17] <hellyeahrefactor> hey
[04:04:26] <hellyeahrefactor> any suggestion to improve my code https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/ ?

[11:55:21] <arup_r> Hi, I am looking for a way to validate an uploaded image is 500X500 or not. I see some solutions using HTML5 API, but will it be a good idea to use that API when I would like to take crossbrowser benefits?
[11:55:41] <arup_r> If no, can you point me to some standard references?
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> an uploaded image, or an image within a file input?
[12:01:17] <arup_r> image within a file input
[12:02:57] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: ^
[12:09:55] <robertmaxrees> iirc without uploading it you're kind of SOL for older browsers.
[12:12:48] <graphettion_> ppl still use older browsers?
[12:12:53] * graphettion_ checks century
[12:13:15] <robertmaxrees> graphettion_ we still have enough people on IE8 to support it.
[12:13:23] <decx> the madmen
[12:13:35] <robertmaxrees> also: global/country stats don't tell you who's using your site ;)
[12:13:44] <decx> *refreshes maxthon*
[12:14:00] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, I thought this was a thing http://www.infoworld.com/article/3020534/security/microsoft-will-end-support-for-internet-explorer8-9-and-10.html
[12:14:13] <robertmaxrees> graphettion_ that doesn't mean that users switched.
[12:14:31] <robertmaxrees> my company still makes enough money off of users of those browsers that we currently support them.
[12:14:43] <graphettion_> Wow, crazy.
[12:15:01] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just because X company says they no longer support something doesn't mean people actually upgrade.
[12:15:06] <graphettion_> We'll never get away from FLASH!!!
[12:15:08] <graphettion_> lol
[12:15:27] <graphettion_> That's true, but they should.
[12:15:31] <graphettion_> Damn users!
[12:16:59] <robertmaxrees> granted, our definition of "support" is different than what most people think of as "support".
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> our test is "can they navigate to a product, get to our cart, and check out?"
[12:17:24] <decx> *won't explode that violently
[12:17:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:17:35] <robertmaxrees> all extra features of the site are basically nice-to-haves.
[12:17:48] <decx> that's the baseline i aim for even without js
[12:17:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:18:12] <decx> variants are my nemesis tho
[12:18:22] <decx> in that nojs baseline
[12:18:26] <graphettion_> Yeah, that's a good idea.
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> heh, we have some stopgaps for some of that stuff but yeah, they're a massive PITA.
[12:18:44] <decx> always with the forms
[12:19:03] <robertmaxrees> all about that target demo.
[13:15:36] <NaN> does .queue() works with any function or is it only for fx?

[13:16:10] <robertmaxrees> :)

[13:18:01] <NaN> hehe sorry
[13:18:30] <jerit> where the face is taplar?
[13:19:30] <graphettion_> prolly in guantanamo bay
[13:20:15] <graphettion_> A good way to torture me is to give me a pentium 4 with dial-up. I'd tell you everything after that.
[13:28:49] <jerit> apparently this code is executing the error block of the ajax even if things appear to go well with the post http://pastebin.com/Cn4bHUY6
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> then things didn't go well.
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> what's the status code you're getting on the frontend?
[13:30:27] <jerit> HTTP 200
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> and the response body?
[13:30:46] <jerit> Content-Length: 0
[13:30:48] <jerit> so nothing
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13756
[13:33:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might need to change the dataType you're expecting.
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> what's your content-type from your server?
[13:36:18] <jerit> robertmaxrees: here's the whole response -> http://pastebin.com/C2qxh5dD
[13:36:50] <jerit> When I wrote the API I figured the response code would be enough, in case of a success, to tell the client application "everything worked"
[13:37:23] <robertmaxrees> the issue is jquery is trying to figure out how to handle the empty response.
[13:37:24] <jerit> so that's why the response is empty
[13:37:30] <jerit> ah I see
[13:37:33] <robertmaxrees> it might be defaulting to something like JSON.
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> try setting the dataType to the text one and see what happens.
[13:38:17] <jerit> In any case, can't muddle about it now. Client wants delivery
[13:38:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:38:30] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm suggest the quick and easy fix client-side.
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> to see if it even works.
[13:38:52] <jerit> how do I do that?
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'text'
[13:39:11] <robertmaxrees> it's an option you pass to ajax.
[13:39:23] <robertmaxrees> like url or type
[13:41:12] <jerit> oh right
[14:04:06] <z1haze_work> what is the difference if when i want to create a stringifyed object whether or not i wrap my keys in quotes or not. for example To: { .. } vs "To": { ... }
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:05:31] <z1haze_work> i need to pass into a rest request a json body or whatever and the example shows a json object like { "From": { "Address": "value", ... }, "To": { ...
[14:05:52] <robertmaxrees> ah, JSON requires you to quote the property names.
[14:05:55] <z1haze_work> i just know in javascript when you create objects its just like Object = { key: "value" }
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> JSON and JavaScript aren't the same :)
[14:06:10] <z1haze_work> so would stringify do tha tfor me
[14:06:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tj3Lst5z/
[14:06:47] <robertmaxrees> you tell me :)
[14:07:11] <z1haze_work> guess i could have tested that easily thanks
[14:08:42] <EGreg> hey guys
[14:08:46] <EGreg> is this cheap $(element) ?
[14:08:52] <robertmaxrees> define "cheap"
[14:08:54] <EGreg> or should I save it and cut down on it
[14:09:01] <EGreg> like, I have a choice of doing $(this) everywhere
[14:09:06] <EGreg> or var $this = $(this);
[14:09:09] <EGreg> and then using $this
[14:09:25] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need to run the constructor, don't run it.  if you need it, use it.  are you seeing performance issues?
[14:09:46] <EGreg> no
[14:10:03] <EGreg> I was just hoping someone knew the implementation of $(element)
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> it runs a constructor.
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> that returns a new jQuery object which then has all the methods and stuff you love on it.
[14:10:53] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't run it unless you're actually going to use those features/benefits.
[14:11:27] <_TWG_> Does anyone have a quiz software they like for creating HR trainings with a quiz throughout them?
[14:11:44] <_TWG_> I've been looking around and there are quite a few out there just wondering if anyone had a favorite.
[14:11:48] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ our company uses litmos.
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> not sure how much they love/hate it in HR, but it's pretty simple as a user.
[14:13:26] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: thanks.  I've seen that before but I doubt they will go for it as it would run us around $600 a month and they were wanting me to build something.  Haven't done a training with interactive quizzes before.
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> so are you shopping for a solution or looking to build one?
[14:13:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.
[14:14:13] <arc_> i think he's shopping for a free solution :)
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> so he's not trying to build one.
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> got it.
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in #web?
[14:14:45] <_TWG_> Well I'm looking at both.  I'm swamped with things to do and this is lowest on my list and if there was a "cost effective" one then I could make that suggestion to them.
[14:16:03] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: should that link have taken me to #web-overflow?
[14:16:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:16:19] <_TWG_> Hmmm
[14:16:30] <robertmaxrees> are you registered?
[14:16:37] <_TWG_> Yes
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:16:42] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[14:16:44] <_TWG_> Now I'm banned from it. Hmmmm
[14:17:00] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you're not authenticated?
[14:20:06] <idioglossia> hi everyone. How would I add a selected object to a containing div? i.e. I want to add every <input type="text"/> to a <div> so I end up with <div><input type="text"/></div>
[14:20:12] <idioglossia> wrap each input in a div
[14:20:13] <idioglossia> basically
[14:20:32] <robertmaxrees> idioglossia so you want to wrap a series of elements with divs?
[14:20:38] <idioglossia> correct
[14:20:42] <idioglossia> like how jquery mobile wraps iputs
[14:20:44] <idioglossia> inputs*
[14:20:55] <idioglossia> if you have <input> it'll wrap it in <div class="ui-input-text"> or whatever
[14:21:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[14:22:05] <robertmaxrees> ?g jquery wrap element
[14:22:15] <robertmaxrees> boooooot.
[14:22:51] <idioglossia> thank you sir :)
[15:23:29] <arup_r> Why do I get always undefined? https://jsfiddle.net/u0fbr9g5/2/
[15:23:49] <arup_r> I am selecting a radio button and then getting alert as undefined
[15:28:36] <shoky> arup_r: your selector looks for input with name equal to 'sponsorship[category]:checked'
[15:28:51] <arup_r> yeah, sorry I need to sleep it seems
[15:29:02] <arup_r> I just got it
[15:29:21] <arup_r> brain doing unproductive work.. :p
[15:29:25] <arup_r> thanks shoky
[17:20:36] <distrtedpuppy> I’m having an issue with an Ajax-generated form not posting. Specifically, I’m getting the error “SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'quantity' cannot be null”
[17:20:37] <distrtedpuppy> http://codepen.io/aurelius/pen/qNrbNE
[17:22:33] <distrtedpuppy> anybody have any ideas?
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> check $addoffertocartbutton1.serialize() and make sure it's doing what you think it is.
[17:32:25] <distrtedpuppy> Well, I start off with the form on the page, and it posts
[17:33:29] <distrtedpuppy> it’s just if the form is generated by ajax, it doesn’t post the second time
[17:34:02] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:34:22] <robertmaxrees> so then the issue is what?  a php error or ajax doesn't run at all?
[17:34:38] <distrtedpuppy> it doesn’t seem like a php error
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> “SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'quantity' cannot be null”
[17:35:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a backend error.  so that means the data being fed to your backend isn't formatted correctly.
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> or there's something else wrong.
[17:36:10] <distrtedpuppy> yea, the values from the 2nd form do not get posted
[17:36:21] <distrtedpuppy> so it is the same exact form
[17:36:36] <fission6> anyone have any ideas how to interprit this, http://imgur.com/a/Q0Ct0 for some reason my jquery / js is running super slow
[17:36:45] <fission6> i am not sure where to start
[17:37:23] <robertmaxrees> fission6 i'd have to see the code.
[17:37:54] <robertmaxrees> distrtedpuppy are you adding/removing any of the elements that you're selecting at the top of your doc ready?
[17:38:00] <robertmaxrees> or $('#offer_modal_window') ?
[17:38:46] <arc_> i just realized that i wrote a whole script where i didn't use var to declare any variables
[17:38:50] <arc_> does that mean they're global
[17:38:51] <arc_> i don't remember
[17:40:25] <distrtedpuppy> #offer_modal_window remains. It has a child, #offer_target, which gets the form
[17:41:39] <robertmaxrees> arc_ yep.
[17:41:50] <arc_> thx
[17:42:21] <robertmaxrees> distrtedpuppy no clue then.  i don't have enough here to really say one way or another.
[17:42:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see more context.
[17:44:10] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, I'll show you more context bic boi.
[17:44:46] <arc_> uh huh
[17:45:57] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:48:48] <distrtedpuppy> I figured it out
[17:48:53] <distrtedpuppy> kind of a dumb mistake
[17:49:17] <graphettion_> https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3275754177/e8088e38eb8e791308ad8c11fed7c6c8.jpeg
[17:49:37] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> and what was the mistake?
[17:49:50] <robertmaxrees> graphettion_ heh welp
[17:50:03] <distrtedpuppy> two inputs in the form had the same name
[17:50:14] <robertmaxrees> ah.  that'd do it.
[17:54:09] <graphettion_> Were their names Tom and Jerry?
[17:54:52] <graphettion_> Damn it. I failed.
[18:40:55] <NaN> how do I execute the queue from an element if I add a function with $el.queue('name', function() {...}) ?
[18:43:49] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com/queue/#queue2
[18:44:21] <robertmaxrees> though i have to ask - why are you usuing queues?
[18:46:18] <NaN> I notice there's a function that executes many times so I wonder to use it for return if $el.queue('name').lenght >= 1
[18:46:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:46:46] <NaN> I would like to execute a function only 2 times max
[18:47:18] <NaN> So I would like to use the element queue to execute if queue.lenght =< 2
[18:47:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not how queues work.
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> queues are for async operations.
[18:47:34] <robertmaxrees> set a data attribute on the element instead.
[18:47:50] <NaN> it's ok if my fn executes async
[18:48:03] <NaN> I prefer not touch the DOM
[18:48:12] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't touch the DOM.
[18:48:25] <robertmaxrees> and the functions used IN queue are meant to be async.
[18:48:55] <robertmaxrees> just use .data() though. it's meant for things like this.
[18:49:30] <graphettion_> .data("bic boi")
[18:49:57] <NaN> Ok I will use data() but what's wrong with using queue if my fn could be execute asyn?
[18:49:59] <graphettion_> aiight I'm out
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> NaN you're misapplying queue.
[18:50:15] <robertmaxrees> it's not meant to track the number of times something is executed.
[18:50:43] <robertmaxrees> though you could theoretically use it for that, it's a lot quicker and easier to just use .data() to hold that state for you instead.
[18:50:49] <NaN> got it... I will not use it for that, but... what is it for? (besides fx)
[18:51:15] <robertmaxrees> for cases where the functions you're calling are asynchronous and you need a way to manage the order things happen.
[18:51:27] <robertmaxrees> you could just as easily use deferreds for that though.
[18:51:31] <robertmaxrees> or chain things, et.c
[19:01:31] <NaN> lets say my fn is async, would be better to use queue to execute/limit ?
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:01:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into other options.
[19:02:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you looking to limit btw?
[19:06:56] <NaN> cause is a layout fn so if its called so many times it get's slow
[19:07:46] <robertmaxrees> then you want to throttle or debounce the function.
[19:29:01] <NaN> what's the diff between throttle and debounce (always thought it's the same)
[19:30:34] <robertmaxrees> one limits the frequency, the other fires after something hasn't happened for a while.
[19:33:11] <robertmaxrees> throttle means "i want this to fire at most 10 times a second", debounce says "i want this to fire 15 ms after the user has stopped resizing the window"
[19:33:13] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[19:44:59] <graphettion> It makes sense to me bobby tables.
[19:45:12] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:45:16] <graphettion> LOL
[19:49:02] <graphettion> http://i.imgur.com/G0YYDXE.gif

[19:49:56] <graphettion> In conjunction to your 'welp.'
[19:51:57] <graphettion> Failing at trying to entertain you at jquery is a full-time job. Trying to balance out the bad attitudes you get.

[21:13:05] <arc_> this is unrelated but something to keep in mind is that you can put a whole jquery object into a variable and then call methods on the variable so you aren't running the selector every time
[21:13:24] <Awmusic12635> good point
[21:13:46] <Awmusic12635> https://paste.ee/p/pRUxw
[21:13:50] <Awmusic12635> this one has the html line it is matching
[21:17:47] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/fLn6c987/
[21:17:49] <arc_> idk, seems to work
[21:18:37] <Awmusic12635> arc_ does it matter if the line was dynamically added
[21:18:44] <Awmusic12635> at one point
[21:18:49] <Awmusic12635> it isn't being replaced
[21:18:52] <arc_> you said it works the first time though
[21:18:54] <Awmusic12635> yea
[21:18:57] <arc_> so no
[21:19:25] <arc_> probably need to see more code than just that i guess. how are you firing this event
[21:19:46] <Awmusic12635> wait I think I know why
[21:19:55] <Awmusic12635> the age old case of being stupid
[21:20:06] <arc_> heh
[21:20:42] <Awmusic12635> yep fixed it
[21:20:46] <arc_> what was it?
[21:21:03] <Awmusic12635> I had it in an if statement that originally created the element if it didn't exist. But it only runs the first time to create the element
[21:21:10] <arc_> lol
[21:21:15] <arc_> internet
[21:21:28] <Awmusic12635> Had it in there to not repeat some code, but didn't remember it only ran once lo
[21:21:31] <Awmusic12635> lol *
[21:21:47] <Awmusic12635> Thanks for your help either way. Sometimes just helps to talk about it
[21:22:47] <arc_> np
[21:32:46] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone -- having some issues. I have a link that I call $link.click() on from a function, and I also have an event handler for the link click. It's firing, but it seems like it's firing too late? The event calls e.preventDefault, but when I debug in chrome the link has already caused the page to the jump to the top by the time it hits the preventDefault line, making it useless. I don't understand ho
[21:32:46] <DoctorMonocular> w that could happen?
[21:34:24] <arc_> need to see your code

[23:34:14] <Captain_Ramius> Hi everyone. I'm trying to make a simple webapp for internal use at my company. How can I make a single page app using AJAX to reload only one part of the page?
