[00:15:50] <GeekMonkey> Woet I got it would by adding a 500 delay
[00:20:48] <elyort> I've got a pretty softball jquery question I can't figure out for the life of me. Anyone got a minute?
[00:24:46] <Woet> elyort: take a look at the rules in the topic
[00:25:30] <elyort> you got it
[05:34:22] <galgamach> Is  setOption  deprecated in version 3?  I can't see it in the deprecated page but still getting an error
[06:08:55] <nindustries> Hi, so setTimeout(doSomething(), 100) interferes with my COntent-Security-Policy header, so I'm trying setTimeout(function(){ doSomething(); }, 100); which never gets fired. Ideas?
[06:36:54] <nindustries> nvm
[08:19:35] <tayzee> hey guys, please can someone assist.. i am creating an accordion dynamically from a list of items i receive from my server using php. in each accordion item there is a text box and a submit button. each accordion id is appended with $i and each submit button is appended with $i. So for example if there are 5 items, there will be 5 accordions with their respective ids being #heading1, heading2, heading3, heading4 and heading5, with t
[08:20:22] <tayzee> submit1, submit2, submit3, submit4, submit5.. my question is, how do i apply click events in jquery to multiple dynamically created buttons?
[08:21:36] <tayzee> example on click submit1 heading1 background changes color... so on click #submit[x] heading[x] changes color, that is what i am trying to achieve
[08:32:09] <AdamPDotty> container.on('click', '.submit', function(){$('active').removeClass('active'); $(this).find('.heading).addClass('active')});
[08:32:23] <AdamPDotty> missing '
[09:23:40] <Neo4> guys what do you think about 'reverse engineering'? Is it very fast way to make applications and to learn new opportunities?
[09:34:41] <IJsbrand> Neo4 im inteserted as well. need to know assembly
[09:35:02] <Neo4> IJsbrand: why? No we can apply it for jquery
[09:35:34] <Neo4> IJsbrand: take prepared code and break down it and do your own code, This is wide notions and apply for every domains of industry
[09:35:47] <Neo4> cars, electronics, apps
[09:36:33] <Neo4> low developed country must take these and use, anyway it will take less time then do research and do your own product
[09:36:49] <Neo4> IJsbrand: in general it's good, do you agree with me?
[09:37:09] <IJsbrand> yes
[09:37:27] <IJsbrand> hence why open source is so popular
[09:38:21] <Neo4> time saver, yes break down alian code is not nice but it will better than something do own. Because you can't do so perfectly like exists have already made products. I think might be this is reason why people say for learn programming better break down code
[09:39:25] <Neo4> IJsbrand: yes, because you take open source code, learn it and on this base you will able to do your on code and will save much time. For example gitgub is good resource for ideas
[09:42:52] <Neo4> all web programming php, javascript in general are open source, but like said Bill Geits it's wrong. People should bay for software...
[09:43:21] <undefined_bob> you still need to understand the code... thats where most people fail...
[09:44:10] <Neo4> undefined_bob: it's not problem and it won't bring you money, main idea it's do product and sell it people... Money is main idea
[09:46:12] <Neo4> I like Bill Gaits Ideas, Paid software will motivate people to make this world better...
[10:09:33] <Arimil> Does jquery support binary ajax requests in some way? I'm currently using the npm jquery release which puts me on 3.3.1 and I've found much discussion about this and quite a few workarounds. But some of the things I've read imply that this is now implemented.
[10:10:56] <Arimil> Simply using a regular ajax request seems to give me malformed data.
[10:31:28] <grek> hi i have problem with install yarn - it want remove npm , node here is info

[15:45:50] <catbadger> whatup

[15:46:51] <catbadger> hi
[15:51:05] <grapheti> ayyy
[15:52:39] <catbadger> sure is quiet today
[15:53:04] <grapheti> You disturbed the peace.
[15:53:18] <catbadger> **SPLASH**
[15:53:56] <grapheti> :D
[16:20:02] <Guest232> okwtf
[16:20:26] <Guest232> .on("click", This.Handler.bind(This));
[16:20:35] <Guest232> now i see my This
[16:20:39] <robertmaxrees> why are you uppercasing 'This'?
[16:20:41] <Guest232> but i lost jq this
[16:20:44] <Guest232> i dont know
[16:20:48] <Guest232> some idiots did that
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> you're explicitly changing 'this' to a different object, so it's not the jquery object.
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> use the event object to get the element instead.
[16:21:31] <Guest232> ?
[16:21:35] <Guest232> oh right
[16:21:37] <Guest232> now
[16:21:39] <Guest232> how
[16:21:46] <Guest232> yes i see the event here
[16:22:07] <Guest232> so  $(this) is lost now?
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:22:13] <Guest232> using bind
[16:22:16] <Guest232> y
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> because 'this' has changed to whatever you bound.
[16:22:21] <Guest232> were it went?
[16:22:25] <Guest232> oh
[16:22:31] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever you passed in...
[16:22:34] <Guest232> how to get the data
[16:22:38] <Guest232> .data()
[16:22:42] <Guest232> from event
[16:22:44] <robertmaxrees> for the element?
[16:22:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler
[16:22:54] <Guest232> yes
[16:24:05] <Guest232> dam i feel like i landed in the past
[16:24:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:24:29] <Guest232> yeah
[16:24:46] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[16:24:53] <Guest232> $(event.currentTarget).data();
[16:24:56] <Guest232> lel
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> or $(event.target).data()
[16:25:07] <robertmaxrees> depending on which you care about.
[17:37:23] <newbie666> anyone alive?
[17:38:15] <newbie666> i'm using the twitter bootstrap wizard and doing some $.post in another function.. and i want to move to the next only after the $.post is finished... any ideas how do i return true from the $.post().done ?
[17:38:37] <newbie666> i can sone code/skin if anyone is interested ...
[17:38:45] <newbie666> i can show some*
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> newbie666 don't work that way :)
[17:45:36] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code?
[17:45:42] <newbie666> just a sec
[17:47:43] <newbie666> https://kopy.io/DTLw8#line-155
[17:48:15] <newbie666> so in the beforeNext event i need to return true of the $.post is successful ( from the .done ) ...
[17:48:22] <newbie666> or maybe i should use another event? change ?
[17:48:27] <newbie666> or .. dunno...
[17:48:45] <newbie666> my head hurts lol
[17:49:03] <robertmaxrees> what is mWizard?
[17:49:49] <newbie666> http://vinceg.github.io/twitter-bootstrap-wizard/#docs
[17:49:53] <newbie666> just with another name
[17:49:57] <newbie666> but it's the same plugin
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't see a beforeNext event >.>
[17:50:25] <robertmaxrees> super confused.
[17:51:04] <newbie666> it's basically the same thing
[17:51:09] <newbie666> as with onNext
[17:51:33] <newbie666> but i think it's more of a js thing: how to return true in that part from the .done function of $.post
[17:51:43] <newbie666> and i can't use async/await :(
[17:51:48] <robertmaxrees> you can't.  you can return the ajax call itself and then attach a .then()
[17:52:05] <robertmaxrees> or you pass in the function oldschool style and use a callback.,
[17:52:15] <newbie666> well i tried that
[17:52:18] <newbie666> but it doesn't work
[17:52:23] <newbie666> hold on
[17:55:54] <newbie666> damn... actually it worked with the cb, but it's going in a loop coz of some other shit i did
[17:56:14] <newbie666> but at least i found the answer i was looking for: there ain't no other way than using a cb..
[17:56:24] <robertmaxrees> there might be.
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> :) usually there is.
[17:56:36] <newbie666> ?
[17:56:42] <newbie666> well go on, do tell
[17:56:44] <newbie666> don't keep it for urself
[17:56:50] <newbie666> sharing is caring
[17:57:15] <robertmaxrees> about to run to a meeting, but you can pass around promises.
[17:57:30] <robertmaxrees> usually takes some refactoring to get them to work.
[17:57:41] <newbie666> damn... :( more work
[17:57:47] <newbie666> ok
[17:57:52] <newbie666> have fun @ ur meeting
[17:57:54] <newbie666> and thanks :)
