[03:00:55] <devi8> how can I encapsulate a mathematical comparison in an object. like, milestone={boundary:50, comp:lessthan, dir:1}
[03:08:40] <devi8> I want to setup a way to register "scrollPoints" that can be used to provide callbacks based on an elements scrolling position, scrolling speed, and scrolling direction.
[03:09:47] <devi8> so you could register a scrollPoint that fired a callback when the scrolling element reached the maximum scroll position or the minimum or any arbitration trigger position.
[06:17:55] <TeddyMurray> anyone need help from a jquery master
[06:17:56] <TeddyMurray> :D
[16:00:35] <DeltaHeavy> In modern browsers, later than IE, what browser inconsistencies does jQuery still resolve?
[17:40:50] <skypce_> i have a function with a var inside , how can i call a var outside of function?
[17:41:08] <skypce_> without calling the function
[17:49:48] <DeltaHeavy> skypce_ Can't
[18:23:42] <skypce_> ok DeltaHeavy
[18:25:59] <skypce_> thanks
[18:31:03] <DeltaHeavy> np
[19:07:41] <skypce_> i have a form
[19:08:00] <skypce_> i need that returns texts values but i get : <p>Referral:undefined</p>
[19:08:21] <skypce_> i was debugged each var and i have right results
[19:08:34] <skypce_> the problem is when i try to add all variables in only one
[19:45:56] <skypce_> i have this
[19:45:57] <skypce_> https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/bOvJWX
[19:46:12] <skypce_> the function returns me undefined text
[19:46:15] <skypce_> why , thank you
[20:53:22] <devi8> skypce_ can you paste more of the form? a broken but working example where you get the error?
[20:54:35] <skypce_> ok
[20:55:30] <devi8> You are asking for a return value from assigning an event handler. $(sel).change(function () {dostuff} does not return a value. You need to assign a callback (in doStuff) that assigns your value, but doesn't return it.
[20:59:30] <jrockjiggz> #jquery
[20:59:54] <skypce_> i will do it tomorrow devi8
[20:59:57] <skypce_> i am tired
[21:00:02] <skypce_> see you guys thanks
[21:02:56] <devi8> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/wRmbBM
[21:03:46] <devi8> Here you can see that you can update the value of the #result div when the option is selected. Value is different from option.text also important
[21:12:22] <skypce_> thank you devi8
[21:13:14] <skypce_> var $extrafields = "<p>Message:"+message.val()+"Arrival:"+$arrival+"</span><p>Number of months:"+$number_months+"</p><p>Number of adults:"+$number_adults+"</p><p>Number of kids:"+$number_kids+"</p><p>Referral:"+$referral_field+"</p>";
[21:13:27] <skypce_> this var
[21:13:28] <skypce_> is the problem
[21:13:39] <skypce_> i can see individual fields that update fine
[21:13:49] <skypce_> i change the option and them change too
[21:14:14] <skypce_> but when i try to format all vars in this extrafield var
[21:14:20] <skypce_> says undefined
[21:14:27] <skypce_> only render html
