[01:44:01] <kamo> hello
[01:55:04] <nickenchuggets> on the server side, what do I return to a $.post() call to indicate an error
[01:55:46] <nickenchuggets> I believe {'status': 'OK'} is the convention for success, but I can't find what to return on failure
[01:56:14] <kamo> 403 error with a message to the catch function
[01:58:30] <nickenchuggets> thanks
[02:27:10] <Cork> nickenchuggets: a 4xx or 5xx error depending on the error is cause of client or server
[04:30:43] <rizonz> how can I select an element without a classname in a inelement that has a classname some levels lower ?
[04:31:48] <Cork> rizonz: $('div.the-class').closest('ul')
[04:32:01] <rizonz> Cork: kewl thanks!
[04:32:16] <Cork> rizonz: .closest only checks parents though
[04:32:18] <Cork> not "around"
[04:33:10] <rizonz> parents ? I hope childs
[04:33:30] <Cork> rizonz: it works the other way around
[04:33:37] <Cork> rizonz: $('div.the-class') is the child
[04:33:55] <Cork> .closest('ul') checks for the closest parent of the div.the-class element
[04:33:56] <rizonz> ok, but I need a child of a class
[04:33:59] <rizonz> "class"
[04:34:17] <Cork> so you want to find the child of the class element?
[04:34:30] <Cork> that would be the css standard $('ul.the-class div')
[04:37:33] <rizonz> OK, kewl!
[04:37:40] <rizonz> I' always confused
[04:38:12] <Cork> if you only want direct children (not grand children) use ex. $('ul.the-class > li > div')
[04:39:43] <rizonz> Cork: yeah indeed :)
[04:39:45] <rizonz> thanks!
[04:43:17] <rizonz> Cork: would it be possible to apply it on two child of one parent if the parent had 5 childs for an example but they are all different element types and you need to select two of them ? or do I need a new element selector for both ?
[04:43:43] <Cork> rizonz: "yes" but => jsfiddle.net
[04:44:19] <Cork> make sure to include the different situations you need to handle
[04:45:40] <rizonz> heh  $('.classname > div a, span').slideUp(); removed all spans
[04:45:51] <rizonz> yes need to build some example
[05:33:48] <rizonz> what is a smooth way to resize a button animated ?
[05:37:11] <rizonz> ah animate
[05:58:37] <rizonz> mhh I true to animate a <a> button to 0 and let it fade away like that but it' css seems ot be in it' way because of padding and such, what should I do to override that ?
[06:59:04] <Cork> rizonz: slideToggle might be the simplest solution
[08:29:33] <Trashlord> is it possible to execute direct javascript code using something like $(if (stuff) { do_something(); } }
[08:29:47] <Trashlord> );, heh, forgot to close it
[08:32:15] <Trashlord> nevermind
[08:40:41] <Trashlord> my entire way of thinking was wrong, heh
[09:00:06] <IamTrying> IE, Safari, Chrome, Firefox etc etc. How to take a current page picture? and send to agent on other side?
[09:04:18] <Cork> IamTrying: you can't
[09:04:51] <Cork> what you would have to do is render the page server side and then provide that image to the browser
[09:05:26] <undefined_bob> hey Cork :) how're you doing today?
[09:05:38] <Cork> the reason is, if the user is logged in, you could get access to information you would other wise not have access to (ex. the users login information for facebook)
[09:05:43] <IamTrying> https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/examples.html - i tried that Cork. But in many sites like www.government.com/login/after/private_page you have ID cards access etc etc or flash
[09:05:48] <Cork> undefined_bob: same, same
[09:06:09] <undefined_bob> I thought about you at the weekend
[09:06:12] <IamTrying> I really need like real "Take picture say cheese"
[09:06:22] <Cork> ya, flash blows my comment out of the water
[09:06:27] <IamTrying> Right.
[09:06:30] <Cork> but flash is eol in 2018
[09:06:41] <IamTrying> Then i thought write external plugin. That also screwed.
[09:06:48] <Cork> ya
[09:06:52] <Cork> you can't do it in the browser
[09:07:07] <IamTrying> Right. Finally its the browser community should sit together and give that option in the browser.
[09:07:09] <Cork> and as far as i know no one has even figured out a way to do it safe
[09:07:40] <Cork> there is a way to do it, but browser has had to disable it cause of security problems (take the dom as a source for canvas and then just store it to an image
[09:08:06] <Cork> firefox even had it as a demo back in... 2012 i think
[09:08:17] <Cork> but it never went further then nightly
[09:10:06] <undefined_bob> hm, what about like a 'paste field' the user can paste a screenshot in?
[09:10:54] <IamTrying> thats not nice undefined_bob
[09:11:05] <IamTrying> what Cork say make sense. we suffering ....
[09:11:33] <IamTrying> I wrote myself in Chromium. But who will teach IE, Safari?
[09:11:41] <undefined_bob> ya true but maybe we can think about some workarounds?
[09:11:54] <Cork> you're not really going to find one
[09:12:06] <undefined_bob> sad
[09:12:16] <Cork> and as extensions are getting more and more restricted that isn't really going to be a way forward either
[09:12:26] <IamTrying> I think the best alterantive would be writing an external OSX and Windows plugin. And then via URL Scheme recall that? Cork?
[09:12:36] <Cork> IamTrying: plugins are getting removed too
[09:12:39] <IamTrying> Make that plugin open source maybe?
[09:12:41] <IamTrying> OK
[09:12:42] <Cork> not really an option
[09:13:02] <Cork> all you will have support for in browsers is webextensions
[09:13:05] <IamTrying> I have to get retired soon then. lol its all so complex....
[09:13:13] <Cork> everything else is eol 201x
[09:13:53] <Cork> so webstandard, serverside or webextension it is your three options
[09:13:59] <Cork> and server side can do it
[09:14:06] <Cork> it will just not be "as the user"
[09:14:21] <Cork> all you need to do is use something like phantomjs
[09:14:52] <Cork> as long as the user don't need to log in, it should work decently
[09:15:31] <IamTrying> How do you capture then Flash objects or Silverlight Cork?
[09:16:09] <Cork> you would have to look at if phantomjs can run plugins, i haven't ever needed it so can't say
[09:16:41] <IamTrying> OH - IC what you mean. Like rendering absolutely
[09:16:50] <Cork> ya
[09:17:05] <Cork> you can use phantomjs to render the page and then just ask it to save the result to a png
[09:17:18] <Cork> i've done that, it is built into the program it is quite easy
[09:17:39] <IamTrying> Make perfect sense Cork. thank you i will do that way.
[10:56:20] <kristhian> hi
[10:56:46] <kristhian> i have a question, i got this code in stackoverflow
[10:56:49] <kristhian> https://pastebin.com/i5HstEAJ
[10:57:06] <kristhian> what i wanted there is to stop incrementing when it reaches 10
[10:57:10] <kristhian> how do i do that?
[10:57:11] <kristhian> thanks
[10:57:33] <Cork> html(clicks % 10)
[10:57:47] <Cork> :)
[10:58:01] <Cork> or just disable the click handler when clicks is 10
[11:04:13] <kristhian> aw, thanks
[12:13:01] <coder7of9> how can i have both an onclick and an onmouseover event for the same element in ios
[12:16:02] <guideX> if you have an <ul> with <li>'s and want to add new <li>'s with jquery, it's append right?
[12:16:08] <guideX> at the end
[12:25:30] <hellyeah> jqery has something for webgl?
[12:34:07] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah jquery is a dom abstraction library.  not sure what it would do for webgl as apart of that :)
[12:34:21] <hellyeah> ah
[12:34:22] <hellyeah> :D
[12:43:45] <jq> If I change data-id to test on an element, then try to get each element with the data-id "test", it doesn't get the new one that I just changed. Is there any way to do so?
[12:43:58] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you're doing?
[12:44:32] <jq> Ughhh why do I always need to make a fiddle when it's not a code error -_-
[12:44:39] <jq> Sec
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:45:03] <robertmaxrees> because on the surface, what you're trying to do is reasonable and easy.
[12:45:18] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to help when i don't know what the code looks like :)
[12:49:44] <jq> I did exactly as I said
[12:49:56] <jq> I can't make a fiddle, it's telling me the function doesn't exist when I'm making the function
[12:50:00] <jq> Stupid POS
[12:50:08] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you've got so far?
[12:50:22] <jq> I'm using attr('data-id', 'test'); to set the data-id to test
[12:50:34] <robertmaxrees> are you using .data('id') to then get the value?
[12:50:35] <jq> Then doing a .each function to grab each and check the data-id
[12:50:39] <jq> Yes
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> can't mix and match.
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> either need to always use .attr or .data
[12:50:58] <jq> So I gotta do attr(data-id ?
[12:51:08] <robertmaxrees> or set using .data('id', 'test')
[12:51:12] <jq> I couldn't get it to set with .data('whatever, test)
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> it was setting.
[12:51:22] <jq> For some reason it wasn't changing
[12:51:25] <jq> NAh it wasn't
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> you were probably looking at the inspector?
[12:51:32] <jq> Yeah
[12:51:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[12:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't update.
[12:51:39] <jq> So it doesn't visually change
[12:51:39] <jq> Lol
[12:51:42] <jq> Ofc
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery updates a cache for those elements.
[12:51:48] <jq> I hate js so much
[12:51:49] <jq> Lol
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> that's more of a js quirk.
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> err, jq
[12:52:12] <jq> js, jq, hate em both
[12:52:13] <jq> Lol
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:53:01] <jq> I'll switch back to .data then and ignore the fact that I don't see a visual update
[12:53:10] <jq> Sorry for the ping visual
[12:53:11] <jq> Lol
[12:53:13] <robertmaxrees> it's there.  you can verify using console.log
[12:55:11] <jq> Ayyy you're right
[12:55:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:55:27] <jq> I just assumed it wasn't working and switched to attr since I didn't see the change in dom
[12:55:29] <jq> -_-
[12:55:32] <jq> Ughh
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:57:11] <jq> Well yay it all works now
[12:57:19] <robertmaxrees> rad
[12:57:30] <jq> Super laggy though
[12:57:40] <jq> Cause there's like 800 divs on the page
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> that'
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> *that shouldn't be too badf.
[12:57:58] <robertmaxrees> which part is slow?
[12:58:20] <jq> When I push the wrapper holding the 800 divs over to slide a menu in on the side
[12:58:25] <jq> Super shoppy
[12:58:29] <jq> *choppy
[12:58:42] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery to animate it?
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if so, that's likely why.
[12:59:22] <jq> Yeah, but only cause it calculates how much to push based on screen size
[12:59:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you could do that all with CSS transitions.
[12:59:49] <jq> It only pushes the main content over if there isn't enough room for the menu
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> and/or animations.
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> using jquery to animate things is slow.
[13:00:16] <jq> I'm so behind on all the new css stuff
[13:00:25] <robertmaxrees> heh, now's a good time to learn :)
[13:00:54] <jq> How the hell do you factor in screen size to css
[13:00:56] <jq> o.O
[13:01:01] <robertmaxrees> media querioes.
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> *queries
[13:01:09] <jq> Oh god I hate those
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> that's how you do it.
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> they're really pretty easy.
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> @media (max-width: 1024) { /* this all applies to 1024 and lower screens */ }
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> etc
[13:02:18] <jq> But you cant have a dynamic variable inside though
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean something like x percent minus a numbver?
[13:02:34] <robertmaxrees> *number
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> like 50% - 15px?
[13:02:59] <jq> Nah
[13:03:09] <jq> For example I'm using var move = (1710 - $(document).width()) / 2;
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can do that.
[13:03:15] <jq> Then $("#contentHolder").animate({ left: "+"+move }, 200);
[13:03:25] <jq> And $("#menu").animate({ left: "0px", opacity: 1 });
[13:03:49] <jq> Just pushes the content over as much as it needs to
[13:03:57] <jq> If at all
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can do all of that.
[13:04:09] <jq> o.O
[13:04:14] <jq> But how?!
[13:04:17] <jq> -_-
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> calc(1710 - 100vw) / 2
[13:04:29] <robertmaxrees> err, calc((1710 - 100vw) / 2)
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> #css can tell you a lot more.
[13:04:37] <jq> Wtf is vw ?
[13:04:44] <robertmaxrees> http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units
[13:04:49] <robertmaxrees> viewwidth
[13:04:51] <jq> I use call all the time to subtract px from percentages all the time
[13:05:09] <jq> Wow autocorrect
[13:05:10] <jq> calc*
[13:05:31] <jq> So 100vw = document.width?
[13:05:32] <jq> Hmmm
[13:05:42] <robertmaxrees> kindasorta.
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd head over to #css to ask more.
[13:05:53] <jq> I was just gonna say that
[13:05:54] <jq> Lol
[13:06:48] <jq> I just need to hire a front end guy soon
[13:09:31] <poboy> so I'm wanting Users to only display the users that belong to the corresponding Department.  Any thoughts?  https://jsfiddle.net/k4utuzfv/1/
[13:14:50] <jq> Ughhh that feeling when you hit cmd+q instead of cmd+w
[13:14:51] <jq> Womp
[13:26:05] <amundir> fwiw, if you are seeing choppyness with animage left
[13:26:11] <amundir> use transform instead
[13:26:17] <amundir> *animate
[13:27:14] <jq> taplar: How so?
[13:27:43] <taplar> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/
[13:27:53] <taplar> you can use transform paired with translateX, translateY, etc
[13:28:15] <taplar> which when you use those, will cause the gpu to perform the operation, rather than the cpu
[13:28:21] <plamb> can i ask questions about the jquery validation plugin in here
[13:29:16] <jq> taplar: Ahhh hmmm, I'll give it a shot and see if it improves. Thank you
[13:30:09] <taplar> there it is!  https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/  this article goes into detail about it
[13:31:06] <plamb> does an input=range return a value that jquery validation can read? It seems to always say its valid even if i dont touch it
[13:38:20] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/3ru7La94/1/
[13:39:18] <plamb> does it just take the min/max attributes as a rule?
[13:40:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:41:07] <plamb> tbh im not sure what my question is; what this validation plugin is doing is mysterious
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> what do you want it to do, and what is it doing instead?
[13:42:07] <plamb> i want it throw an error if the slider has not been slid (i.e. there is no value) and also if #enterprise isnt checked
[13:42:52] <plamb> so if generate is clicked without touching the slider
[13:43:01] <plamb> it asks the user to provide a size
[13:43:19] <plamb> which i guess it is doing in the fiddle
[13:43:33] <plamb> though not with the message i provided
[13:45:57] <lietotajs> Can someone help me figure this thing out - https://jsfiddle.net/rhmmbyuk/4/ ? I am trying to hide a div, if it does not have class defined in variable (I define this variable with checkbox value). If I console.log(content); the first part I see it working. The problem is second part. How can I combine this? Thanks in advance!
[13:47:36] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs the first thing that sticks out is $('.productList content').show();
[13:48:17] <robertmaxrees> also, your markup is invalid there.  could you maybe flesh it out a tag more?
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> *tad
[13:49:15] <plamb> oh, perhaps this is the problem
[13:49:16] <plamb> Works with text inputs, selects, checkboxes and radio buttons.
[13:49:44] <plamb> perhaps there is no validation methods for input type=range
[13:50:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryvalidation.org/range-method/
[13:50:40] <plamb> right, but i only see people applying that to input type=text
[13:51:35] <robertmaxrees> what about https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/issues/1839?
[13:51:40] <lietotajs> Did little cleaning up - https://jsfiddle.net/rhmmbyuk/8/ .
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs so yeah, what are you expecting with $('.productList content').show();?
[13:52:57] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're trying to get the value of all inputs where the checkbox is checked
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> ah i get it.  so 2 issues here: 1 - that if statement won't run again after the page loads.
[13:54:10] <plamb> oh, maybe its because of my min/max rules
[13:54:12] <plamb> its always valid
[13:54:25] <lietotajs> I am trying to show only divs with class that is same as variable content.
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> 2 - $('.productList content') this is looking for all <content> elements under elements with the class .productList
[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs yeah, so $('.productList content') won't do that - you need ot, for each class in content, find the corresponding product.
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> but that if statement will never match because your fiddle will never get that class.
[13:55:55] <rizonz> Cork: OK will check that out
[13:56:46] <lietotajs> robertmaxrees this is bit over my head, but thanks for trying to help.
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.,
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting lost, btw?
[13:58:48] <lietotajs> The whole second part is a mistery to me. It took me long time to get the first one working.
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> okay, so $('.productList content')
[13:59:35] <robertmaxrees> this is looking for elements called <content>
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> which don't exist.
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> you want elements whose classList contains the value of the checkbox, right?
[14:00:02] <lietotajs> Yes
[14:00:34] <robertmaxrees> right, so instead of what you're doing now, I'd flip the logic - for every selected checkbox, find the corresponding product in the productList
[14:00:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rhmmbyuk/9/ that looks something like tis.
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> *this
[14:04:55] <tr0y> Can someone here help me modify an ajax response using $(document).ajaxComplete() ?
[14:05:24] <robertmaxrees> tr0y maybe - what are you trying to do?
[14:05:51] <lietotajs> Thank you robertmaxrees!
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs that make more sense?
[14:07:46] <tr0y> basically I have a search results page that's paginated. Every other page is loaded via ajax. Check out this site: http://www.dutchmillerchevy.com/VehicleSearchResults
[14:07:52] <tr0y> https://gist.github.com/tr0yspradling/f76771c00d9cd7d6cbc4319fb58f0f4a
[14:08:01] <lietotajs> I guess. It is looking at all .productList children. Then tries to find ones with class defined in first part of this function.
[14:08:06] <tr0y> https://gist.github.com/tr0yspradling/f50aca030f942b150d541e1ea4414792
[14:08:21] <lietotajs> Am I correct?
[14:08:34] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs kind of - it's going through each of the classes you found and finds the elements hunder .productList with each class.
[14:08:45] <robertmaxrees> tr0y so why do you think you need to modify the ajax response?
[14:08:50] <tr0y> Those two gist files are my scripts. The second script2.js file, is where I was experimenting with $(document).ajaxComplete()
[14:09:21] <tr0y> I can't access the elements once the page reloads. .ajaxComplete is actually called before the page dynamically inserts the new data.
[14:09:55] <robertmaxrees> so my first question would be why aren't you doing this in the .then() callback of the particular ajax call?
[14:10:13] <tr0y> go to the first link I sent you and test the pagination for me. Open the network tab in the inspector and you'll see when the response is completed & when the page actually inserts the new elements
[14:10:17] <tr0y> explain?
[14:10:39] <tr0y> does that bind to futurer elements?
[14:10:43] <tr0y> future**
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> back up - is your issue that you have event handlers not binding to dynamically loaded elements?
[14:11:17] <lietotajs> Ok, I will read up on definitions of everything you added. Thanks again!
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs sure!
[14:11:25] <tr0y> i'm not binding an event. i'm trying to insert elements
[14:11:44] <robertmaxrees> tr0y so why does that need to happen in a global ajax handler insted of $.ajax().then() ?
[14:11:57] <tr0y> because I don't have access to the main ajax call
[14:12:17] <robertmaxrees> what's firing that main call?
[14:12:46] <tr0y> Some js is linked to the pagination
[14:12:49] <tr0y> I'm not sure.
[14:12:53] <tr0y> it's not my code.
[14:13:04] <robertmaxrees> and you can't touch any of it?
[14:13:10] <tr0y> No. it's from another agency
[14:13:40] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[14:14:20] <tr0y> we have authorization from the dealership to add this feature to their site, but the company who built the site wants us to go through GM to get authorization as a 3rd party agency. won't happen. so i'm using GTM to insert the code into the site. which dynamically looks for the right elements & generates the button.
[14:14:22] <robertmaxrees> there's really no reliable way for you to get this to work, then.  You'll always be racing.
[14:14:39] <tr0y> GTM is google tags manager
[14:14:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm familiar with GTM.
[14:14:48] <tr0y> Yeah this is a hack.
[14:15:27] <robertmaxrees> i might start by verifying that you're only running your code on the particular ajax call.
[14:15:46] <robertmaxrees> because right now you're catching anything done via jquery it looks like.
[14:16:39] <tr0y> That callback seems to only fire after the pagination links are fired. i've seen other ajax requests made in the console & it's not firing
[14:17:11] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just giving you places to start to try to get this to work.
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> this has the potential to break a bunch of JS on the page, so you're also going to have to contend with that.
[14:18:47] <tr0y> I've tried everything -I- can think of. :( I've even tried capturing the request.responseText & inserting the button in the variable, then replacing the content on the page. this didn't work, the button didn't insert, but the images for the vehicles also didn't load.
[14:19:08] <robertmaxrees> probably because a lot of this relies on client-side js heh.
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> basically, your code is running after theirs.  you're trying to modify in-flight before it hits the page.
[14:20:10] <tr0y> hmmm.
[14:20:50] <robertmaxrees> so you're kinda SOL
[14:21:17] <robertmaxrees> so you need to hit some API for every car on the page?
[14:21:33] <tr0y> what do you mean?
[14:21:47] <robertmaxrees> i may have misread: what'
[14:21:48] <tr0y> are you talking aboiut where it appends the VIN number to a URL?
[14:21:54] <robertmaxrees> *what's the base of the request?
[14:21:58] <robertmaxrees> like, what're you trying to do?
[14:22:50] <tr0y> Basically i'm trying to insert a dynamically generated button onto the search results page. each vehicle card has the VIN number in it. So it scrapes that VIN & appends it to the URL of the button. Each button has a different URL.
[14:23:00] <tr0y> This works on the first page when $(document).ready() is fired
[14:23:09] <grapheti> Finally talking about vehicles in here.
[14:23:11] <tr0y> but doesn't load when the next page is fired
[14:23:31] <robertmaxrees> tr0y are you adding a new button or replacing a button that's already there?
[14:23:37] <tr0y> adding a new button
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> hummmm.
[14:24:02] <tr0y> if the other agency was friendly and would work with us, I wouldn't need all this dynamic code lol
[14:24:16] <tr0y> they could just install a button on their end that pulls their vin variable. they've got it all in their software.
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[14:24:45] <tr0y> Look at the bottom of this file: https://gist.github.com/tr0yspradling/f50aca030f942b150d541e1ea4414792
[14:24:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to modify the response in your ajaxcomplete, why nbot just append the buttons?
[14:25:14] <tr0y> modifying ajaxComplete was my last ditch effort.
[14:25:47] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you could just append the buttons and use an event handler to take the user to the right place.
[14:26:47] <tr0y> how would I go about doing that though? After the ajax response is done, and after the new elements have been added to the DOM?
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[14:27:13] <tr0y> I wish ajax had something similar to $(document).ready
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> so ajaxComplete might be what you need
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd trying just injecting a button using that.
[14:27:42] <tr0y> ajaxComplete is called before the new content is inserted :(
[14:27:48] <physikoi> Hello #jquery . I'm trying to use jquery with stupid squarespace. It loads just fine; however, element selection always turns up null (accept for document and 'body'). EG, `$("img")` returns `null`. Why might this be? thanks
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:28:02] <robertmaxrees> tr0y you sure about that?  getting away from your example.
[14:28:27] <robertmaxrees> physikoi try console.log($.fn.jquery); - what do you get?
[14:28:42] <physikoi> sec
[14:29:00] <physikoi> hmm. `TypeError: $.fn is undefined`
[14:29:15] <robertmaxrees> what about console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> :?>
[14:29:25] <physikoi> sec
[14:29:25] <robertmaxrees> * ?
[14:29:27] <hellyeah> i know this is really simple but
[14:29:32] <hellyeah> var $dialogBox = ('<div>');     $dialogBox.attr('class', 'dialog');
[14:29:38] <physikoi> `ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined`
[14:29:38] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: yeah, i've seen the first search results page add another invoice button. basically the first button from $(document).ready() was inserted, and the ajaxComplete handler was called & just inserted the same button. Then the search results reloaded and there weren't any buttons.
[14:29:44] <hellyeah> $dialogBox.attr is not a function
[14:29:47] <hellyeah> what the heck
[14:29:51] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah fiddle?
[14:30:04] <hellyeah> phlix:  include jquery file
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> tr0y hrm.
[14:30:16] <robertmaxrees> physikoi you're not including jquuery.
[14:30:20] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: what do you make of it? it's odd (to me) that `$(document)` works at the same time
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> physikoi are you doing that in the console?
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> using chrome maybe?
[14:30:47] <Caspan> trying to use this to toggle a hidden command
[14:30:49] <Caspan> $('tbody.ImportTable').next('tr').fadeToggle("fast", function () {
[14:30:50] <Caspan>     });
[14:31:03] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: yeah. I actually haven't even added jquery dependent code yet. Just futzing with console and wondering what's going on :/
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> Caspan mind showing your makeup in a fiddle?
[14:31:08] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/9v4g2rw6/
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> physikoi that's a chrome shortcut.
[14:31:19] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: i'm using firefox
[14:31:20] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: will do
[14:31:34] <robertmaxrees> physikoi if jquery isn't loaded, some browsers will shortcut $ to document.querySelectorAll
[14:31:48] <robertmaxrees> since those two logs return undefineds, that's likely what's going on.
[14:32:08] <hellyeah> include jquery file
[14:32:11] <hellyeah> :D
[14:32:18] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah we've alreayd covered that ;)
[14:32:26] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[14:32:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah uh
[14:32:33] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: that's interesting. would that happen with "body" also? ie `$("body")`?
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees>  var $dialogBox = ('<div>');
[14:32:40] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're missing $
[14:32:41] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: i get the body element back
[14:32:46] <hellyeah> oh damn
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> physikoi because those are both valid selectors using doucment.querySelectorAll
[14:33:07] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: very interesting. OK, thanks for your help!
[14:33:07] <Caspan> NM found it
[14:33:20] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: wow, learn something new everyday :)
[14:33:27] <physikoi> ty
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> physikoi definitely
[14:33:50] <robertmaxrees> Caspan what was it?
[14:35:44] <Caspan> i use the wrong selector
[14:35:47] <Caspan> used
[14:35:57] <robertmaxrees> Caspan aaah.  there you go :)
[14:36:12] <Caspan> not pointed at the right thing makes a big differance
[14:36:21] <robertmaxrees> yep! :D
[14:39:06] <lietotajs> robertmaxrees Tested your code a little. I had a .join('') in there for a reason. I need to join all the checkbox values in one word - milkglutennuts. Now I can not get it to work.
[14:39:07] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: side question, do you think adding a timeout or delay after ajaxComplete would help?
[14:39:13] <lietotajs> What am I doing wrong here?
[14:39:20] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs why does it need to be one word tho?
[14:39:38] <lietotajs> https://jsfiddle.net/hokw9aan/
[14:39:50] <robertmaxrees> tr0y barely.  you're still racing at that point, and the timeout will make things look really awkward
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs then just remove the foreach
[14:40:29] <robertmaxrees> though this seems really fragile to me.
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hokw9aan/3/
[14:40:56] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: you're right. hm. are there any jquery functions to select future elements?
[14:41:08] <robertmaxrees> tr0y nope.
[14:42:28] <lietotajs> Because when I uncheck milk, peanut icescream is still shown.
[14:42:49] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs my last fiddle fixes that (shrug)
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to use a classname as an attribute list.
[14:43:28] <robertmaxrees> like, a list of tags.
[14:44:54] <tr0y> i've tried using a mutationobserver. that didn't really work.
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> tr0y you'll have issues with creating infinite loops using that, too.
[14:45:46] <tr0y> haha yeah that crashed the site when i binded to the change event
[14:45:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:46:13] <tr0y> this is a decently visited site too so i'm sure it affected a handful of people
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:46:25] <tr0y> :P
[14:46:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't have a staging/sandbox environment?
[14:46:41] <tr0y> not for this
[14:46:49] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[14:46:53] <tr0y> yeah ikr
[14:47:37] <tr0y> i'm very limited in my options with this project. it's hacked together, and basically unauthorized by the website vendor
[14:48:15] <tr0y> we will be working with a new website vendor for another dealership & we've worked with them before. I look forward to that setup
[14:48:29] <tr0y> http://www.cdkglobal.com/ is the company that's giving us issues
[14:49:09] <robertmaxrees> anyway.  yeah, you're kinda stuck then.
[14:49:50] <tr0y> there's got to be a way
[14:50:06] <rizonz> is there a reason why a toggle slide "pops" away after a half slide ?
[14:50:25] <robertmaxrees> rizonz whatcha mean?
[14:50:25] <tr0y> is there a DOM irc channel lol
[14:50:37] <lietotajs> robertmaxrees In Jekyll I define food content (alergens, food choices) in front matter. Then I sort it alphabetically and join in a single word. I then apply this word to product class. Next use jquery to hide unwanted foods. It is not the cleanest way to do it, I guess, but I have to start somewhere.
[14:50:56] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: when the slide is about half the size of what I slide away it just vanishes
[14:51:13] <robertmaxrees> rizonz never seen that before.  weird.
[14:51:33] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs erm, so with your current setup you're only going to catch food that matches ALL of those allergens.
[14:51:39] <robertmaxrees> not each food with any of them.,
[14:51:46] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yes indeed weird, I think it can be because there is some padding in what I toggle orso
[14:52:15] <taplar> rizonz: can you show the behaviour in a fiddle?
[14:52:57] <poboy> shouldn't this give me the value of what's selected in the dropdown?  It's only showing the value of the 1st option no matter what I click.  https://jsfiddle.net/zuw18zr9/
[14:53:18] <robertmaxrees> poboy 2 things
[14:53:50] <robertmaxrees> actually just one - $('select#deptSelectList :Selected') - should just be $('#deptSelectList')
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> the value of the dropdown is the value of whatever is selected.
[14:54:06] <robertmaxrees> also: IDs are unique.
[14:54:42] <taplar> and strings are immutable
[14:54:45] <lietotajs> robertmaxrees Take the nut ice cream. What I am trying to do is hide it if person has unchecked milk or nuts. Not only if both of them are unchecked.
[14:55:02] <rizonz> taplar: trying to but as it' kinda some huge thing I need to cut the right parts out, I' also checking out for other people that have this
[14:55:33] <poboy> robertmaxrees so I can't do select id="deptSelectList"?
[14:55:41] <robertmaxrees> poboy huh?
[14:55:50] <poboy> you said IDs are unique
[14:55:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:56:00] <lietotajs> Will add more products and see if my plan breaks down.
[14:56:05] <robertmaxrees> you can only use  id="deptSelectList" once per page./
[14:56:18] <poboy> var selectList = $('<select id="deptSelectList" name="deptSelectList" class="select2" style="width:100%;"/>');   so that is no good?
[14:56:27] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:56:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm super confused.
[14:56:42] <robertmaxrees> i was just explaining that your selector was doing too much.
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically generating multiples of this select?>
[14:56:59] <obert> don't use inline CSS style
[14:57:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too, but focusing on the ID thing...
[14:57:16] <lietotajs> I think it is already broken.
[14:57:21] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs heh
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs it sounds like you want to hide any food that contains any of the allergens, right?
[14:58:20] <poboy> robertmaxrees, yes it's dynamic.
[14:58:21] <lietotajs> I guess.
[14:58:34] <robertmaxrees> poboy using an ID for that is a bad idea thenm.
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> poboy since oyu can't repeat an id.
[14:59:04] <taplar> lietotajs: do you have control over your markup generation?
[14:59:27] <lietotajs> taplar yes
[14:59:34] <robertmaxrees> ezpz then.
[15:00:04] <taplar> instead of making the single string then you could add them with spaces so they are classes
[15:00:04] <poboy> idk, that's how the user list is generated and it works as intended
[15:00:15] <robertmaxrees> poboy until you add multiples.
[15:00:18] <taplar> then just $('.'+ ingredient).hide()
[15:00:21] <robertmaxrees> and then anything but the first one won't work./
[15:00:39] <poboy> i just want the value of the one that is selected
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> poboy then .val() ont he select itself will work.
[15:01:03] <taplar> though originally i was thinking of some sort of data-ingredients="['milk', 'eggs']" that you could do an indexOf on...
[15:01:33] <poboy> will you tell me how to do that?
[15:01:42] <robertmaxrees> i already did >.>
[15:01:48] <lietotajs> robertmaxrees I am trying to build a "dynamic" restaurant menu where client can uncheck things he does not eat. For example, people who do not like gluten. Then uncheck gluten box and every foot containing gluted is hidden.
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> $('select#deptSelectList :Selected') - should just be
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> $('#deptSelectList')
[15:02:08] <taplar> lietotajs: can you link your fiddle again?
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> lietotajs yep - taplar gave you exactly that.
[15:04:14] <poboy> robertmaxrees - it's still just giving the value of the 1st option https://jsfiddle.net/zuw18zr9/1/
[15:04:21] <robertmaxrees>  right
[15:04:26] <robertmaxrees> bnecause you can only use an ID once per page.
[15:04:30] <taplar> lol
[15:04:34] <robertmaxrees> hence my entire point about that.
[15:05:33] <poboy> idk, I guess I'm not any smarter after this conversation than before.  Can you help me?
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> I'm trying to...
[15:05:58] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting confused?
[15:06:04] <taplar> "don't repeat ids".  where's the confusion?
[15:06:24] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating an ID on the page, so every time you try to select using an ID, you're only ever going to get the first element with that ID.
[15:06:40] <lietotajs> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/e9k4xffg/
[15:06:56] <taplar> poboy: also regardless of that your pastie has the var set -outside- the handler
[15:07:12] <taplar> so even if you were using a class properly, that logic is fubar
[15:07:14] <poboy> taplar:  it was undefined when I moved it up
[15:08:45] <poboy> the confusion is: why is <select id="someID"> an issue?  This whole project is full of this and there were no problems. Eventually a lead dev will help me but I'm trying to solve this on my own and failing :)
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> because you can't repeat IDs on the page.
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> you'll see things kind of work until you, for isntance, select them with jquery.
[15:09:17] <robertmaxrees> IDs have to be unique.
[15:10:03] <taplar> lietotajs: https://jsfiddle.net/e9k4xffg/2/
[15:11:30] <poboy> this seems to violate the ID thing you mentioned but when a user's name is selected from the dropdown, all the correct values show up and everything works as intended. https://kopy.io/p7NQR
[15:12:06] <poboy> ID's are being repeated in that code, is that correct?
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> nop.e.
[15:12:19] <robertmaxrees> $('#companySelectList').html(selectList); replaces contents of an element.
[15:12:56] <robertmaxrees> and there's no contextual lookup going on, so you're only ever update that one place.
[15:13:22] <poboy> guess i need to become a janitor or something
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:13:32] <robertmaxrees> just gotta learn a bit.
[15:15:39] <poboy> so the question is: is there anyway to limit the results of "companySelectList" based on what is selected in "departmentSelectList"?
[15:15:51] <poboy> I'm sure it's a pain dealing with noob questions all the time
[15:16:04] <hellyeah> what is janitor?
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> poboy huh?
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to change the options available in companySelectList based on what's selected in departmentSelectList?
[15:16:51] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it's somebody who cleans for a livign.
[15:16:53] <robertmaxrees> *living
[15:17:20] <plamb> is there a different method than .preventDefault i should be using to block a form submission?
[15:17:22] <lietotajs> taplar I think it is working, but in opposite way. I was trying to make it so everything is show when all boxes are checked and then client uncheck what he/she does not want to have in food. But big thanks to you both for helping me.
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> plamb that's the oine.
[15:17:40] <poboy> robertmaxrees, yes
[15:17:41] <hellyeah> .attr('disabled' true) plamb
[15:17:46] <taplar> lietotajs: then you just need to flip the show()/hide()
[15:17:50] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah he wants to preventDefault.
[15:18:06] <robertmaxrees> plamb make sure you're binding to the submit of the form and not of a button or something.
[15:18:08] <hellyeah> he asked for different method i guess
[15:18:18] <plamb> for some reason its not blocking submission hmmm
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> plamb mind showing?
[15:18:32] <hellyeah> you need to use one more method beside preventDefault
[15:18:34] <plamb> im binding to an id of the input type=submit
[15:18:36] <taplar> plamb:  you're not in a delegate are you?
[15:18:41] <hellyeah> i dont remember what it is plamb
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> plamb that's why.
[15:18:48] <robertmaxrees> plamb you need to bind to the form itself.
[15:18:50] <robertmaxrees> not the submit button.
[15:18:59] <plamb> like $(form).submit ?
[15:18:59] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you don't need to use more than preventDefault()
[15:19:02] <plamb> and not .click
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:19:09] <plamb> i see
[15:19:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:19:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/trmemx7g/ hellyeah plamb
[15:20:49] <taplar> did you mean to make that a <button> or type="submit" ?
[15:21:08] <robertmaxrees> good catch: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/trmemx7g/1/
[15:21:13] <robertmaxrees> does the same thing either way.
[15:21:33] <lietotajs> taplar tried that. It won't work with nut ice cream. If I uncheck milk or nuts it is still shown.
[15:21:48] <lietotajs> I am clueless on why.
[15:22:01] <taplar> ah
[15:22:01] <taplar> it's doing OR logic currently
[15:22:20] <taplar> so for an item to show, the user has to have selected all of the ingredients?
[15:22:30] <robertmaxrees> that seems odd.
[15:22:31] <plamb> does anything look off about this codeblock about preventing form submission?

[15:22:46] <robertmaxrees> plamb well
[15:22:48] <robertmaxrees> if($('.instances').children('li').length === 0 ){
[15:22:53] <robertmaxrees> oh also
[15:23:03] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault; preventDefault is a method.
[15:23:05] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault();
[15:23:08] <plamb> oh
[15:23:08] <lietotajs> Yes. For example, client eats nuts, but does not like milk products.
[15:23:12] <plamb> maybe thats the issue
[15:23:13] <poboy> robertmaxrees so how do I change the options available in companySelectList based on what's selected in departmentSelectList?
[15:23:22] <lietotajs> So he/she unchecks milk.
[15:23:53] <robertmaxrees> poboy lots of ways.
[15:23:57] <lietotajs> Nut ice cream should be hidden.
[15:24:19] <poboy> heh.  can you tell me one please/
[15:24:32] <taplar> so really we need to flip the logic a little
[15:24:47] <robertmaxrees> poboy are you totally changing companySelectList?
[15:24:48] <taplar> find the elements that are -not- checked, and hide foods with those ingredients
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> poboy because one way would be to rerender the options in companySelectList.  that would probably be the easiest.
[15:25:45] <poboy> I wasn't planning on changing companySelectList at all
[15:25:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e9k4xffg/4/
[15:25:52] <poboy> but I can if it will work
[15:25:53] <robertmaxrees> poboy wat
[15:26:00] <robertmaxrees> "robertmaxrees so how do I change
[15:26:00] <robertmaxrees> the options available in companySelectList based on what's
[15:26:00] <robertmaxrees> selected in departmentSelectList?
[15:26:13] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to disable options or...?
[15:27:11] <poboy> right now companyselectlist shows every user.  I'm just wanting to only show users that match the new dropdown departmentSelectList
[15:27:32] <robertmaxrees> and i assume it's a different set of users for each department?
[15:27:38] <poboy> correct
[15:27:51] <robertmaxrees> so then you do want to change it ;)_
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd rerender the options in that dropdown based on that list.
[15:28:38] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, at least.
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[15:28:54] <lietotajs> taplar My logic is already out of the window, but after looking at you latest fiddle, yes it was an easy fix. Big Thanks!
[15:29:54] <lietotajs> Now I can clean my jekyll code too.
[16:00:50] <physikoi> for anyone that cares, i figured out what's going on with squarespace. When in development mode, you can't access site content directly from the console because it's in a bloody frame. ack
[16:01:02] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaaahhhhh
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> that explains a LOT.
[16:06:39] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: client insisted on squarespace, so just gonna have work with unfortunately.
[16:08:12] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: May I ask, is web design that you do?
[16:08:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:08:25] <robertmaxrees> oh, is it what I do?
[16:08:50] <carcrash> could anyone help me with getting the value of a select? I have tried this which I believe should work, but I am getting undefined as the value
[16:08:51] <carcrash> http://jsbin.com/noxoyehuzu/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[16:09:35] <poboy> so if this is the logic for being able to select users, shouldn't I just be able to put a "while" loop around it to change the options based on what was selected in another dropdown?  https://jsfiddle.net/og0z1hxm/
[16:10:31] <robertmaxrees> so carcrash fwiw you can't technically define youir own attributes.
[16:10:51] <poboy> basically something like this, only with correct syntax or whatever.  https://jsfiddle.net/og0z1hxm/1/
[16:10:56] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: *nods*
[16:12:17] <robertmaxrees> carcrash however, jsbin.com/paxenaqupe/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[16:12:26] <robertmaxrees> physikoi i'm more of a dev than a designer.
[16:12:37] <robertmaxrees> got a whole team for the design side of things.
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> poboy what do you eman?
[16:12:52] <carcrash> robertmaxrees, ok. That may be so, and I can work on that, but it is still an issue without the attributes
[16:13:02] <robertmaxrees> carcrash already showed you the fix.
[16:13:03] <carcrash> robertmaxrees, what did oyu do, just change element ot this?
[16:13:14] <robertmaxrees> grabbing the .val() of the select.
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> not of the selected option.
[16:13:25] <robertmaxrees> and using a jquery event listener.
[16:13:56] <carcrash> ok thanks.
[16:14:24] <carcrash> is there actually a difference between .on('change', ...) and .change(...)?
[16:14:42] <carcrash> I thought they were analogous
[16:14:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.  .change() just shortcuts to .on('change'
[16:15:27] <carcrash> k ty
[16:16:22] <robertmaxrees> physikoi why do you ask?
[16:17:46] <poboy> robertmaxrees, i'm still trying to solve the issue from earlier.  That was my idea, but clearly it does not work.  :)
[16:18:06] <poboy> going on 5 hours now for what should be a super-simple solution.
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> poboy the "while loop" thing is where i'm lost.
[16:18:36] <robertmaxrees> do you just want all users with a given departmentID?
[16:18:44] <poboy> correct
[16:18:50] <robertmaxrees> also: $(departmentList.int_DepartmentID).val(); - what is departmentList?
[16:19:12] <poboy> departmentList was the id for the first dropdown
[16:19:14] <robertmaxrees> an example of departmentList and userList might be kinda helpful.
[16:23:23] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: just curious. I'm very early in my career. If it's too personal of a question, please accept my apology.
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> not at all!
[16:23:55] <robertmaxrees> just wondering what you needed to know, that's all :)
[16:24:37] <poboy>  robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/x8Bmw
[16:26:11] <poboy> I just want to show the users where the int_DepartmentID matches the int_DepartmentID of the first dropdown
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> what?
[16:26:25] <Al_nz1> I have a few inputs that I need to be checked for not empty and a picker that must have a valid date on click. is there a way to do this other than != ""
[16:26:51] <robertmaxrees> poboy totally losty.
[16:27:01] <robertmaxrees> *lost. are those supposed to be arrays of objects?
[16:27:11] <poboy> yes
[16:27:18] <poboy> oh my goodness
[16:27:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:28:09] <poboy> I just dont' understand why I don't seem to be capable of solving these problems in the first place, but also why I seem to fail miserably at asking questions in a way people understand
[16:28:20] <robertmaxrees> well, for a protip:
[16:28:28] <poboy> please
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> when somebody asks fdor example data, just paste example data.  remove sensitive data, but if it should be arrays of objects, then give an arrayu of obje3cts.
[16:29:05] <Al_nz1> just use required on the inputs ? @myself
[16:29:37] <poboy> I just assumed everthing is arrays of objects.  :)
[16:29:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:29:47] <robertmaxrees> people do some strange things.
[16:29:54] <poboy> userlist, departmentlist, etc...
[16:30:16] <robertmaxrees> okay so the second bit.
[16:30:23] <robertmaxrees> breaking down problems.
[16:31:02] <Al_nz1> ok, that didnt work - I put required on the inputs in the html, but I was still able to submit the modal window :-(
[16:31:15] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you need to get all users whose departmentId matches the selected departmentId, right poboy?
[16:31:25] <poboy> correct
[16:32:35] <robertmaxrees> so fwiw, there's a "filter" method for arrays.
[16:34:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7m1h7r7t/
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can just do this.
[16:36:15] <robertmaxrees> i'ma just throw a buncha stuff atcha: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7m1h7r7t/1/
[16:36:19] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: any thoughts on validation?
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[16:37:24] <Al_nz1> how to handle it? just test val() !="" or use some validate plugin or?
[16:37:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation
[16:37:54] <robertmaxrees> polyfill for browsers that don't support native.
[16:39:07] * Al_nz1 reading
[16:39:10] <Al_nz1> thanks Robdgreat
[16:39:16] <Al_nz1> thanks robertmaxrees
[16:41:48] <Al_nz1> and heres what i dont understand - I put required in but can still submit empty fields
[16:42:51] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 well
[16:43:00] <robertmaxrees> are you doing a native form submit?
[16:43:03] <robertmaxrees> or something different?
[16:43:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: its a modal
[16:43:24] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:43:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:28] <Al_nz1> so its not the form submit
[16:43:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> just because it's a modal doesn't mean it's not a normal form submit.
[16:43:44] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[16:43:53] <robertmaxrees> is the form being submitted via ajax?
[16:44:29] <Al_nz1> no, the on click even just injects what was in the form into a table on the main page
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't answer my question.
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[16:45:12] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: not using ajax
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait.  so you're taking data from the modal and popping it to a form elsewhere?
[16:45:37] <rizonz> when I have 3 divs next to eachother and the right one has a float:right but moves to the left when I toggle the middel and left div, is this a behaviour that happens because of the toggle ?
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> rizonz gotta fiddle showing what you mean
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:45:56] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah
[16:46:25] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 well
[16:46:42] <robertmaxrees> you can add the require attribute to those form elements, then on submit of the form in the modal, check to see if it's valid.
[16:46:49] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: whe whole toggle as well ?
[16:47:00] <rizonz> *the
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> rizonz whatever i need to see your issue.
[16:47:12] <rizonz> ok, trying
[16:47:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: so in onclick look for that custom class that is added?
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 huh?
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 on submit of the modal of the form.
[16:47:58] <robertmaxrees> just always preventDefault and go from there.
[16:49:07] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: there is no prevent default
[16:49:10] <Al_nz1> its
[16:49:10] <Al_nz1> $('#save').click(addTask);
[16:49:16] <Al_nz1> which calls addTask
[16:49:17] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:49:40] <Al_nz1> but I could call validate first, then validate if pased calls addTask?
[16:49:48] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - you can still add preventDefault to that handler. 2 - you need to change that to a handler for the form submit.
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> validate before calling addTask.
[16:50:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: that onclick I dont want to submit the whole form - just add the modal data to the window behind it
[16:50:32] <Al_nz1> (validated first)
[16:50:35] <robertmaxrees> dude
[16:50:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:51:01] <robertmaxrees> adding a submit handler to the form for that modal is a slightly cleaner way to do it, and as an added bonus your $(this) will already be thje form.
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> less effort.
[16:52:54] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: I got it working. :D
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> cool dude!
[16:53:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok, but back to validation? is there anything wrong with onclick calling validation function and if that passes then insert the data?
[16:53:21] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 lol
[16:53:32] <robertmaxrees> you can do that if you want, but html has built-in validation that's called on submit.
[16:53:40] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/tr0yspradling/02493644900b582e0941cdbef579b152
[16:53:42] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) your call on what to do at that point.
[16:53:58] <robertmaxrees> tr0y yikes heh
[16:54:04] <robertmaxrees> just be aware that's gonna be fragile.
[16:54:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: right so that goes to why currently the required fields do nothing!
[16:54:12] <robertmaxrees> also: do you need to support mobile?
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i've tried to explain it to you.
[16:54:24] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: mobile @ me?
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:54:29] <robertmaxrees> tr0y
[16:54:42] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: ok, this is the css fiddle only so far: https://jsfiddle.net/ymngocof/
[16:54:59] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: im just checking, the required field attribute on the modal will only be enforced if its a submit?
[16:55:05] <Al_nz1> vs a onclick?
[16:56:01] <robertmaxrees> rizonz ah so this is a pure CSS issue?
[16:56:10] <tr0y> yeah, robertmaxrees. It works on android. we're going to test iphones right now.
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> tr0y soooo i'ma suggest soimething.
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> tr0y are those phones on wifi?
[16:56:41] <tr0y> Not sure. why?
[16:56:53] <robertmaxrees> try 'em on a degraded connection.
[16:57:14] <tr0y> Oh yeah it's definitely going to load slow as shit
[16:57:18] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: no not really, when I toggle the link div and the span, the button moves to the left
[16:57:18] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: are you saying a modal can inject its data using a submit?
[16:57:26] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: Im a losty
[16:57:38] <tr0y> it's being loaded through google tag manager too. so the button takes a few seconds to load after the page loads
[16:57:42] <robertmaxrees> tr0y not just that, but you assume 500ms is going to be fast enough.
[16:57:43] <tr0y> Not my problem.
[16:57:51] <robertmaxrees> err, long enough.
[16:57:53] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[16:57:58] <tr0y> we're putting pressure on the dealerships to change vendorss
[16:58:17] <tr0y> so that's why i'm not worried. if the vendor won't give us access on the dealerships request, then that's their problem.
[16:58:18] <robertmaxrees> rizonz i guess this looks like an issue with your css to me.
[16:58:23] <robertmaxrees> tr0y fair enough.
[16:58:42] <tr0y> Buuuuut as long as it's ~working~, i'm not sweating.
[16:59:04] <tr0y> Thanks robertmaxrees for your help though. Much appreciated.
[16:59:08] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you're overcomplicating your whole thinmg.
[16:59:22] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i've tried to explain it.  dunno what else you're expecting at this point.
[16:59:29] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: yeah would say but the float is right
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> rizonz i might hit up #css - they'll probably have a better idea than I will.
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees> at least it'll probably be faster hahaha
[17:01:14] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: im trying to understand. Let me show you what I have in a fiddle - how about that?
[17:01:18] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: haha, no prob1
[17:01:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:02:17] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: in that ame example the link div also "pops" away on half the toggle, testing that out
[17:02:18] <tr0y> robertmaxrees: are you good with regex?
[17:02:22] <rizonz> *same
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> tr0y i'm okay with it.
[17:02:35] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript might be better for that tho.,
[17:02:41] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/70f180bd/
[17:02:44] <tr0y> thought i'd ask haha. thanks!
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 okay?
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 my advice is still the same.
[17:04:05] <robertmaxrees> also:
[17:04:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: Im trying to understand your advice
[17:04:19] <robertmaxrees> #assignee, #supervisor, #taskText etc
[17:04:21] <robertmaxrees> are those selects?
[17:04:57] <robertmaxrees> and my advice is simple.
[17:05:08] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes its simple to you
[17:05:29] <robertmaxrees> create a form and put those inputs into the form.
[17:05:39] <robertmaxrees> then use a submit handler for the form. check validity in said handler.
[17:05:41] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[17:06:07] <Al_nz1> so I will have two sets of form tags in one page?
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:06:57] <Al_nz1> ok - now there could be a reason why that wont work.... lemme test something
[17:07:07] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason for that to not work.
[17:07:14] <robertmaxrees> but okie :)
[17:12:47] <Al_nz1> so I have my modal wrapped inside <form></form> and the "save" button <button type="submit">Save changes</button> with tags in the modal with required .....but it still let me click save and close modal????
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> right.  so now on submit of the modal, to e.preventDefault();
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> *do
[17:14:19] <Al_nz1> but doesnt the "required" in the html stop the submit before any JS?
[17:15:21] <robertmaxrees> "but it still let me click save and close modal????" - does the page reload?
[17:15:26] <robertmaxrees> or does the modal simply close?
[17:17:00] <Al_nz1> the modal closes
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> using a boostrap modal?
[17:18:23] <Al_nz1> yes
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> got any code in the modal that might be triggering that to close?
[17:18:34] <robertmaxrees> or code in your js anywehre.
[17:19:07] <Al_nz1> i will do a more complete fiddle aye?
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:25] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> i gotta get back to this.
[17:19:35] <Al_nz1> arrrgh
[17:20:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: does this look right?
[17:20:17] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/upb0nc0w/
[19:00:58] <rizonz> ok, now my toggle issue is ok, I wonder if it' possible to resize a button from right to left
[19:30:15] <rizonz> I nailed it!
[20:48:49] <Al_nz1> this should change the value of the tastText textarea right? $('#tasktext').val('');
[20:54:35] <ngharo> tastText != tasktext
[20:54:58] <ngharo> so, no
[20:58:01] <Al_nz1> ngharo: well spotted
[20:58:03] <Al_nz1> thanks
[21:13:47] <rizonz> how can I select the first and second div', so childs, of a fieldset ?
[21:13:55] <renic> Hello
[21:14:54] <renic> I'm trying to figure out how to get access to the message body of a response in $.ajax(setting) from within settings.complete() and settings.error()  is this possible?
[21:17:54] <renic> was hoping it would be inside jqXHR.. but I'm either blind, or it's not there.
[22:04:23] <ngharo> renic: responseText should be in the jqxhr object
[22:17:00] <renic> ngharo, I checked that - it did not return the message body... just a one liner.
