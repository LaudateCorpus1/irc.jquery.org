[00:01:00] <UniFreak> WhirledPress: still no
[00:02:36] <WhirledPress> I'd check the html standards for using bracketed ids
[00:05:22] <WhirledPress> perhaps you have to use numeric values inside the bracket or quotes? id='something["bracketed"]'
[00:05:52] <WhirledPress> or id=something['withbrackets']
[00:07:47] <WhirledPress> nope.
[03:17:13] <ConfusedLoader> Hey guys I'm having an issue with a site I'm currently building. http://gustav.be/rembrandt/werkwijze If you navigate to home and then back to werkwijze the dom structure is fucked up.
[04:25:29] <hellyeah> hey
[04:25:36] <hellyeah> anyone around :D
[04:27:54] <happyKatt> not me
[04:34:03] <hellyeah> happyKatt:  do you know about jquery datepicker
[04:37:00] <happyKatt> no sorry
[04:37:05] <happyKatt> why?
[04:37:53] <happyKatt> maybe ask your question and someone might have an answer
[04:38:27] <hellyeah> hmm okay i will ask
[04:38:47] <hellyeah> let say i have .from and .to you can create multiple datepicker
[04:39:22] <hellyeah> for example in the first selection you select 5 - 12 that means in next datepicker you cannot select 4 - 15 so they wont be any overlapping.
[04:39:47] <hellyeah> Is there any built-in functionality to avoild this in datepicker?
[04:46:13] <happyKatt> it doesn't look like it, but I don't know for sure.  maybe write your own code and stick in somewhere?
[04:46:31] <happyKatt> your own 'if' stmt or something?
[04:47:38] <hellyeah> can be
[04:47:44] <hellyeah> i need to reboot my machine
[04:48:44] <happyKatt> okies, gotta go, too! bye!!
[05:18:10] <bongjovi> in an .each() method iteration, is there any difference between this and $(this)[0]?
[05:18:25] <Uhkis> no
[05:18:43] <bongjovi> great, thanks
[05:27:45] <Dorian-Grim> I started using webshim.polyfill();
[05:28:06] <Dorian-Grim> But I have some problems with it. For example for the date types it doesn't load the days
[05:28:08] <Cork> bongjovi: the second one wraps the element in a jquery class and then unwraps it again directly
[05:28:37] <bongjovi> Cork: sure, so it's unnecessary right?
[05:28:41] <Cork> yes
[05:28:56] <Cork> its like doing ([this])[0] basically
[05:29:03] <Cork> (except it requires more work for the parser)
[05:30:53] <Dorian-Grim> Cork: Do you know of webshim?
[05:31:52] <Cork> no, only that one should be careful with shins as they often hurt web standards
[05:33:30] <Cork> *shims* even...
[05:34:51] <Dorian-Grim> So you can't help? :(
[05:35:12] <Cork> make a fiddle showing the problem and i could have a look
[05:35:28] <Dorian-Grim> thanks man, brb
[05:37:48] <Dorian-Grim> But I have some of those strange problems that happens only to my env -.-
[05:38:01] <Dorian-Grim> http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/sy2sM/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=sy2sM
[05:38:38] <Dorian-Grim> Days don't appear as they should in the date picker
[05:39:18] <Dorian-Grim> http://imgur.com/nCynf2p this is how it looks for me Cork
[05:39:44] <Dorian-Grim> And I use the same jquery as that fiddle
[05:39:52] <Dorian-Grim> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[05:40:38] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: sounds like your blocking the iframe the script uses
[05:40:51] <Dorian-Grim> I don
[05:40:55] <Dorian-Grim> I don't have it in an iframe
[05:41:17] <Dorian-Grim> So what should I do?
[05:42:44] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: well you need to make the problem reproducible
[05:46:59] <Dorian-Grim> Cork: How would I do that? :(
[05:47:32] <Cork> uh, take the original page and start reducing dependencies until you can't without unbreaking things
[05:47:36] <Cork> for example
[05:48:47] <Dorian-Grim> god damn it man
[05:49:00] <Dorian-Grim> I have display: none on table tag
[05:49:04] <Dorian-Grim> and that is a table
[05:49:06] <Dorian-Grim> wtf.........
[05:50:36] <Dorian-Grim> Oh well, it's only thanks to you that I looked at this css, thanks to your dependencies hint
[05:52:11] <sl33k_> I am getting missing ) after argument list:
[05:52:17] <sl33k_> 	var cards = $('#droppable5 .cards').append('<span></span>'); 	$(cards).css('background':'url("../images/close_button_2-128.png") ');
[05:53:15] <Cork> sl33k_: check the context
[05:53:20] <Cork> it most likely is from a previous line
[05:53:23] <AdamPDotty> speaking of dependencies: A tag is part of HTML inside a file. display:none works inside a browser.
[05:54:47] <sl33k_> Cork: I am getting an array of elements in var
[05:55:13] <Cork> sl33k_: that isn't what i meant
[05:55:25] <sl33k_> Cork: the css statement is wrong. any idea?
[05:55:28] <Cork> sl33k_: that ) is missing often points to a line later in the file then where the error is
[05:55:43] <Cork> cause it is the first line that can't be inside the participants block
[05:55:52] <Cork> so look at previous lines, the error is most likely there
[05:59:38] <sl33k_> Cork: It was the comma in css function
[05:59:49] <Cork> an no
[05:59:59] <Cork> it was the missing {} around the object key/values
[06:00:12] <Cork> an==ah
[06:00:34] <Cork> (too much ruby... didn't notice >_<)
[06:02:17] <sl33k_> lol
[06:03:07] <Cork> if you don't know key: 'value' becomes { key: 'value' } in ruby...
[07:03:59] <codecutter> need to fire a trigger before  preventDefault - http://pastebin.com/ZGNERq6v
[07:04:44] <Cork> your missing way WAY to much context there
[07:06:06] <codecutter> when the link is clicked it show close the dialog (link is inside a dialog) then prevent link from opening the page ("#")
[07:06:23] <codecutter> should*
[07:06:24] <Cork> codecutter: the context is where those lines of code are meant to run
[07:07:03] <codecutter> lines 4,5 are inside a function
[07:07:11] <Cork> ...
[07:08:12] <codecutter> i may have confused you with line 4, its just a frameworks way of trigger an normal jq event
[07:08:22] <codecutter> triggering*
[07:08:25] <Cork> codecutter: there isn't enough code in the pb to confuse anyone
[07:08:30] <Cork> cause there basically isn't any
[07:09:19] <codecutter> are you allowed to trigger an event inside a function that has a preventDefault()?
[07:09:20] <Cork> if you want help make a jsfiddle.net containing the relevant code to understand what you want to do, and in what context
[07:09:33] <Cork> codecutter: depends on what preventDefault is
[07:09:43] <Cork> (again there isn't enough to tell)
[07:10:02] <codecutter> in my case the prefentDefault stops the link from opeining
[07:10:17] <codecutter> ok nvm
[07:30:16] <dub54> Is there any reason why $(element).removeClass('in').removeClass('out'); would work differently to $(element).removeClass('in'); $(element).removeClass('out');
[07:30:23] <dub54> (i.e. not chaining them)
[07:30:32] <Cork> no
[07:30:41] <Cork> though note you can combine them
[07:30:53] <Cork> $(element).removeClass('in out');
[07:31:11] <dub54> yep, really strange, but my code doesn't work unless they're unchained or not combined
[07:31:19] <dub54> well, it does work - but not as fully expected
[07:31:53] <Cork> dub54: can you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle ?
[07:51:56] <suchness> Is it possible to give a Blob a filename so that when downloaded it has that name?
[07:59:48] <Cork> yes
[08:00:07] <Cork> suchness: i don't remember it off the top of my head how though
[08:00:47] <Cork> ah, right
[08:01:03] <Cork> suchness: you can set download on the link
[08:01:59] <Cork> suchness: $('<a>', { download: 'the-file-name.ext', href: URL.createObjectURL(blob) })
[08:08:53] <cannap> Hi any knoiw whats wrong with .removeClass('[class^="ani_"]');
[08:08:59] <cannap> i want to remove classes starts with ani_
[08:09:10] <Cork> cannap: removeClass takes a string, not a selector
[08:09:16] <cannap> oh
[08:09:29] <Cork> cannap: also never use [class^=""]
[08:09:49] <cannap> hm
[08:09:53] <Cork> if you want groups just separate them with space
[08:10:08] <Cork> <elm class="ani_something"> => <elm class="ani something">
[08:10:22] <Cork> then you can do $('.ani.something') to select that specific one
[08:10:26] <cannap> ah
[08:10:28] <Cork> or $('.ani') to select all of them
[08:10:29] <cannap> thx
[08:11:27] <cannap> hmm the problem is i add random classes because random animation
[08:11:53] <Cork> cannap: hmm
[08:11:54] <Cork> why?
[08:12:00] <cannap> for random animations
[08:12:12] <Cork> not sure why you need random class names for that
[08:12:26] <cannap> [ 'ani_fadeInLeftDown',
[08:12:26] <cannap>      'ani_fadeInRightDown']
[08:12:47] <Cork> so just split them into two classes each
[08:12:47] <cannap> differnt animations
[08:12:59] <Cork> css works with .ani.fadeInRightDown too
[08:13:08] <Cork> it isn't a jquery thing
[08:13:29] <cannap> yea because to detect
[08:13:33] <cannap> the class and remove
[08:13:39] <Cork> ah right
[08:13:41] <cannap> i made prefix_name
[08:13:54] <decx> just remove all classes
[08:14:01] <Cork> an option could be to sue <elm class="ani" data-anitype="fadeInRightDown">
[08:14:01] <cannap> no
[08:14:04] <cannap> ah yes
[08:14:11] <cannap> wait no
[08:14:24] <Cork> and in css .ani[data-anitype="fadeInRightDown"]
[08:14:35] <cannap> ah yes
[08:14:39] <cannap> now i know what you mean thx
[08:14:52] <Cork> and in js $('.ani').removeClass('ani').removeData('anitype')
[08:15:34] <Cork> cannap: another option is to just list all the class types in the .removeClass
[08:15:48] <decx> why would you use data
[08:15:50] <Cork> .removeClass('ani fadeInRightUp fadeInRightDown')
[08:15:57] <decx> ani should be the activator class
[08:16:01] <Cork> true
[08:16:13] <Cork> but if you wanted to remove the animation information
[08:16:19] <decx> and fadeBlah is just more context that's not relevant when you dont have the activator
[08:16:26] <Cork> agree
[08:16:34] <Cork> +d event
[08:16:35] <viewty> Hi all - if my json source gives me something like http://pastebin.com/FN8uQ0XE how can I get the values for "tc" from "internal sensor"? Don't know how to traverse the object.
[08:17:09] <Cork> viewty: data.sensor[0].tc
[08:17:18] <Cork> the [] should prob be a loop
[08:17:31] <viewty> cool thank you :)
[08:17:48] <Cork> viewty: $.map(data.sensor, function(elm) { return elm.tc }) for example
[08:17:56] <Cork> would give you an array of tc values
[08:18:13] <viewty> That would give me the tc values from the different sensors?
[08:18:19] <Cork> yes
[08:18:22] <viewty> Ah I see.
[08:18:26] <viewty> Cool thank you
[08:18:29] <Cork> (it would give you undefined for the few that don't have it though)
[08:19:14] <viewty> Hm ok
[08:19:27] <viewty> Need to plug more sensors in to get more numbers :)
[08:21:38] <cannap> works thx
[08:25:01] <viewty> Thanks Cork, that works great.
[08:39:35] <jak2000> is possible extract the value of an input type='checkbox'   ?
[08:40:07] <taplar> you can use val()
[08:40:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:40:38] <taplar> if your after state, then you want prop('checked')
[08:41:42] <Cork> or if it is an event handler just this.checked
[08:41:56] <taplar> ya, or this.value
[08:42:16] <Cork> though there is a point to $(this).val()
[08:42:21] <Cork> as it normalizes all form fields
[08:42:56] <hellyeah> val/( is innerText in javascript right?
[08:43:02] <hellyeah> val()*
[08:43:04] <Cork> no
[08:43:05] <taplar> no, val() is value
[08:43:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:43:13] <taplar> unless it's a textarea i believe
[08:43:19] <Cork> its this.value or selectIndex for select
[08:43:45] <Cork> i don't even remember what textarea uses.. :x
[08:44:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:45:02] <Cork> ah, ya .value works for textarea too
[08:45:12] <Cork> so it is mainly for select elements
[08:46:21] <taplar> your saying val() for a select is the index, not the option value?
[08:46:52] <Cork> it is a dom value from the select dom element, but ya, i don't remember what it's name is
[08:47:10] <Cork> but it is the same as the option value (or content if value is missing)
[08:47:36] <taplar> ah, i thought you were saying by 'selectIndex' that it was the option index
[08:47:47] <taplar> which would be weird, :)
[08:48:12] <Cork> ya, i meant the selectedIndex property, but ya i think that is wrong
[08:48:59] <taplar> e.options[e.selectedIndex].value;
[08:49:07] <taplar> vanilla style
[08:49:07] <Cork> no
[08:49:11] <taplar> no?
[08:49:12] <Cork> there is another option
[08:49:15] <taplar> hmm
[08:49:23] <Cork> unless my memory is failing me completely
[08:50:42] <Cork> heh...
[08:50:53] <Cork> i could have sworn select doesn't have value...
[08:51:15] <Cork> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/L4cyyvx2/
[08:51:31] <Cork> so ya... there really isn't any reason to use .val() anymore (since old ie's are gone now)
[08:51:44] <taplar> :)
[08:52:01] <Cork> man i still drag around so many workarounds for old browsers (in my head)
[08:52:03] <taplar> unless you live in india
[08:52:13] <Cork> elm.attachEvent and document.all ... >_>
[08:52:56] <taplar> i read an article once that some country, i believe it was india, requires ie6 still for most of their banking sites
[08:53:14] <Cork> ya i think korea does
[08:53:21] <taplar> maybe that was it
[08:53:36] <Cork> they use ton of activex cause html didn't support there writing language
[08:53:51] <taplar> huh
[08:53:57] <Cork> used to that is :)
[08:54:15] <taplar> i figured it was due to ie 7 taking away some of the liberties it had before
[08:54:25] <Cork> some other place used pdf for basically everything a few years back
[08:54:32] <taplar> lol
[08:54:38] <Cork> taplar: ya, as in activex compatibility
[08:55:29] <taplar> i was thinking more about ie6 being able to open new windows in kiosk mode and stuff like that.  what compatibility did ie7 lose?
[08:55:47] <Cork> you could do that in ie7
[08:56:12] <Cork> ie7 was skipped by many cause it was 10x+ slower then ie6
[08:56:14] <taplar> really?  i was pretty sure js couldn't open a new window anymore without some form of the headers still showing
[08:56:17] <Cork> ie7 was dreadfully slow
[08:56:31] <taplar> cause we had a big issue with that ourselves
[08:56:40] <Cork> ie8 was still slower then ie6, but at least usable
[08:57:16] <Cork> taplar: i'm quite sure it was possible, though it was way to long ago to be sure
[08:57:50] <Cork> one big change if i remeber correctly was that ie7 doesn't do ftp
[08:58:02] <taplar> interesting
[08:58:03] <Cork> it redirected you to explorer.exe
[08:58:24] <Cork> (even though iexplorer.exe and explorer.exe is the same program,,,)
[08:58:53] <Cork> you could literally start explorer with iexplorer or the other way around if you wanted
[08:58:59] <Cork> just by passing it an argument :)
[08:59:04] <taplar> :s
[08:59:47] <Cork> both of those are just launchers for calling into the system rendering dlls
[08:59:52] <rominronin> hi
[08:59:54] <Cork> they aren't full programs
[09:00:20] <taplar> huh.  i'll be honest i'm not very informed in that arena
[09:00:24] <Cork> (that is still the case, and why you can't install multiple ies on the same system)
[09:00:27] <taplar> rominronin: yo
[09:00:49] <rominronin> I created some drop-down lists for day-month-year, and I'd like to populate a date field in a form with the user's selection
[09:01:13] <taplar> are the drop downs in the form already?
[09:01:22] <rominronin> what event can I use to fire the update/set, given that the site will be used on mobile and desktop
[09:01:22] <rominronin> ?
[09:01:33] <rominronin> taplar: I generated them myself, using jquery
[09:01:41] <Cork> rominronin: the same things as you use on desktop
[09:01:53] <Cork> rominronin: mobiles emulate the same events desktop uses
[09:01:54] <rominronin> on click? on change?
[09:01:58] <Cork> ya
[09:02:00] <rominronin> ok
[09:02:11] <Cork> you can bind dragstart if you want quicker interaction feel
[09:02:19] <Cork> but it's completely optional
[09:02:20] <taplar> i like touchend
[09:02:39] <Cork> taplar: touchend should be the same thing as click
[09:02:40] <rominronin> I'm also thinking about drop-downs sometimes involving multiple clicks
[09:02:56] <rominronin> one to display, one to select
[09:03:08] <taplar> what kind of drop downs are we talking about?
[09:03:09] <rominronin> onchange i guess?
[09:03:23] <Cork> rominronin: uh, not event attributes
[09:03:24] <rominronin> taplar: <select>
[09:03:29] <taplar> k, just checking
[09:03:40] <rominronin> Cork: ?
[09:03:43] <Cork> rominronin: don't put your js in your html
[09:03:54] <Cork> separate them to make the site managable
[09:03:56] <taplar> change event should be fine i'd think
[09:04:05] <rominronin> Cork: the js is in a separate file
[09:04:08] <Cork> event ya, but not event attrubutes
[09:04:14] <rominronin> i'll try onchange, thanks
[09:04:20] <Cork> ...
[09:04:43] <taplar> that may just be how he refers to them all, not saying hes doing attribute bindings
[09:05:12] <Cork> on* is usually used by ppl doing event attributes (ala w3shcool) though
[09:05:12] <rominronin> my grasp of jquery and its terminology is rudimentary
[09:05:27] <Cork> rominronin: it is actually dom1 vs dom0
[09:05:36] <taplar> typically when you say onEvent, people will assume your talking about inline binding
[09:05:40] <rominronin> You'velost me Cork
[09:05:45] <Cork> elm.addEventListener('change' vs elm.onchange
[09:05:47] <taplar> just Event is fine
[09:05:47] <rominronin> oic
[09:06:01] <Cork> or <elm onchange="">
[09:06:02] <rominronin> nah, my code is in a seperate file
[09:06:14] <taplar> elm.onchange can be in a separate file
[09:06:21] <Cork> ya, but it is event attributes
[09:06:30] <Cork> and it breaks event management
[09:06:34] <taplar> right, i was refuting his last statement, :)
[09:06:48] <Cork> well i kinda group them together
[09:06:56] <Cork> as it is only slightly better
[09:07:08] <Cork> (along with return false in event handlers)
[09:08:58] * taplar and Cork, the two guys that agree, but still seem to debate
[09:09:02] <taplar> ;)
[09:09:12] <Cork> :D
[09:09:28] <Cork> can't say i've ever really argued with you though
[09:09:43] <Cork> more misinterpreted ^^
[09:09:49] <taplar> *shrug* if so, wasn't that memorable
[09:10:39] * taplar taplar_brb
[09:10:53] <sl33k_> I'm getting file not found with this: var img = "background:url(../images/close_button_2-128.png) top left no-repeat";
[09:10:57] <sl33k_> What gives?
[09:11:10] <Cork> sl33k_: use absolute paths
[09:11:18] <Cork> path are relative to the html file not the css file
[09:11:42] <Cork> (or the js file for that matter)
[09:13:14] <rominronin> so quick question: Cork taplar: my field/s is 3-part date selector. I will need 3 functions: 1 for each of day, month and year.
[09:13:22] <WimLeers> Hi #jquery! The Drupal community is looking into upgrading Drupal 8 to use jQuery 3. But there are backwards compatibility concerns, because it probably technically breaks BC. I think it'd be helpful to see you weigh in. Looking forward to your comments at https://www.drupal.org/node/2533498
[09:13:25] <WimLeers> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[09:14:20] <rominronin> cork taplar: ignore that, I need to think about the question more thoroughly
[09:14:30] <Cork> WimLeers: it most likely break a lot of things as it rewrites how much of the core things work
[09:15:48] <taplar> rominronin: since your most likely going to be basing your date logic off of all three inputs, all three will probably have the same event handler
[09:16:21] <taplar> but that's still going back to what i was trying to lead into earlier.  if those inputs are already in your form, you really don't have to contrive another input
[09:17:18] <sl33k_> Cork: even in production?
[09:17:41] <Cork> sl33k_: uh, there is no such term, so "ya"
[09:18:10] <Cork> also note this is still true if you use server generated paths that doesn't really exist
[09:19:05] <Cork> so "http://www.example/some/url/that/gets/parsed/by/server/script" url(../image.png) => "http://www.example/some/url/that/gets/parsed/by/server/image.png"
[09:19:39] <Cork> sl33k_: and this is why you should normally ALWAYS use absolute urls or absolute paths
[09:28:49] <thoraxe> taplar: so i think i see the issue. it looks like jquery is trying to parse JSON from the response
[09:29:16] <thoraxe> SyntaxError: Unexpected token A at Object.parse (native) at n.parseJSON (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js:4:5497) at ub (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js:4:7521) at x (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js:4:10935) at XMLHttpRequest.<anonymous> (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js:4:14765)
[09:29:28] <taplar> so what does your response look like?
[09:29:49] <taplar> is it valid json?
[09:30:14] <thoraxe> no, it's just text.
[09:30:18] <thoraxe> that's probably the issue.
[09:30:38] <taplar> is this the get you were doing yesterday?  i don't remember it having 'json' on it, did you?
[09:30:43] <thoraxe> Added a log statement of type INFO <-- that's the whole page rendered. I could just wrap it with {" "}
[09:30:49] <thoraxe> yeah same as yesterday.
[09:31:01] <Cork> thoraxe: what is the server content-type header?
[09:31:15] <Cork> that is is what dictates if jquery will try to parse it as json
[09:32:24] <Cork> dataType is just a hint for jquery if the server doesn't say what it sends
[09:32:41] <thoraxe> lemme curl real quick
[09:33:04] <Ales> why this not wokring when i run jsfiddle no output https://jsfiddle.net/
[09:33:13] <thoraxe> yeah the content-type is application/json
[09:33:18] <Cork> there you go
[09:33:20] <thoraxe> which i guess is why jquery is trying to parse it
[09:33:21] <thoraxe> easy fix
[09:33:23] <thoraxe> thanks!
[09:33:26] <Ales> sorry. https://jsfiddle.net/06nenr58/
[09:33:26] <taplar> Ales: click save and reshare the link
[09:34:16] <Cork> Ales: works fine here
[09:34:20] <taplar> Ales: it is working, it's just not visible
[09:34:27] <taplar> if you inspect the element, it has that css set
[09:34:37] <Ales> i know because i didnt have any elements in div my bad.
[09:34:40] <thoraxe> so I just need to wrap it in {" "} to make it a valid JSON string yeah
[09:34:56] <taplar> thoraxe: or remove that content-type header
[09:35:18] <Ales> taplar did you extend your domain?
[09:35:31] <Ales> just want to let you know it expires tomorrow
[09:35:35] <taplar> Ales: also changing left or top without the element having a position really has no effect
[09:35:50] <taplar> Ales: if you want me to ignore you, continue
[09:36:00] <Ales> yeah i took this example from jquery site, now im at effects
[09:36:00] <Cork> thoraxe: that sounds weird
[09:36:12] <Cork> thoraxe: cause that doesn't sound like valid json to me
[09:36:15] <Ales> taplar lol? what did i say wrong?
[09:36:56] <taplar> if you have jquery questions, ask.  if you want to continue to try to troll, i will ignore you
[09:36:59] <Cork> thoraxe: i could accept {"response": ""}
[09:37:06] <Cork> thoraxe: but {""} sounds weird
[09:38:04] <taplar> [ '' ] if anything
[09:38:17] <Cork> well [""]
[09:38:18] <Cork> but ya
[09:38:21] <Cork> '' isn't valid json
[09:38:31] <taplar> i'd just knock off the content type.  it doesn't represent the response
[09:38:37] <Cork> ya
[09:38:52] <Cork> or convert the server side output to be json
[09:39:09] <thoraxe> [""] isn't json either...
[09:39:13] <Cork> it is
[09:39:32] <Cork> JSON.parse('[""]') == [""]
[09:39:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4kgov7mo/
[09:40:15] <taplar> nothing says an array can't have only one value
[09:40:32] <Cork> or that it has to have any :)
[09:40:37] <taplar> true
[09:43:00] <Cork> not to forget Array(5).join('wat' - 1) + ' Batman!' :D
[09:43:13] <taplar> lol
[09:43:14] * Cork goes back to work
[09:44:24] <viewty> If I've got <p id="foo"><i class="bar"></i></p>, how can I insert into the p so the result is <p id="something><i class="bar"></i>inserted string</p>
[09:45:22] <taplar> you can just append to foo
[09:45:29] <taplar> if your just doing it once
[09:45:52] <thoraxe> thanks everyone
[09:45:59] <Cork> if you place to replace it add a separate element
[09:53:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:53:34] <hellyeah> what is the equivalence of innerHTML and outerHTML in jquery?
[09:53:49] <taplar> html() and prop('outerHTML')
[09:54:36] <taplar> prop('innerHTML') would probably work too, but html() is shorter
[09:55:05] <hellyeah> ic
[09:55:45] <hellyeah> i may be wrong but innerHTML ansd value stands for same thing no?
[09:55:57] <taplar> no, value is the attribute
[09:56:29] <hellyeah> but both give same output right?
[09:56:35] <taplar> no
[09:56:43] <hellyeah> hmm my bad sorry
[09:56:44] <AdamPDotty> for a textarea?
[09:56:50] <taplar> maybe for a textarea
[09:57:00] <taplar> but for other inputs, no
[09:57:15] <taplar> <input value=""> <--- value
[09:57:29] <taplar> <div>blah blah blah</div> <-- 'blah blah blah' is innerHTML
[09:58:31] <hellyeah> humm
[10:03:41] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/kLbxjm65/
[10:03:47] <hellyeah> innerHTML no output
[10:04:30] <AdamPDotty> ...
[10:05:52] <hellyeah> what happened?
[10:07:19] <arc_> use console.log not alert
[10:07:33] <arc_> it seems to work as expected
[10:09:07] <hellyeah> so text() and innerText are for same thing https://jsfiddle.net/kLbxjm65/1/
[10:11:30] <arc_> .text() is a jquery method. innerHTML is not
[10:11:42] <arc_> .text() and .html() are not exactly the same thing
[10:11:59] <hellyeah> innerHTML is javascript method
[10:12:07] <taplar> text() is not innerHTML
[10:12:15] <taplar> text() will escape the innerHTML
[10:12:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  it gave same result
[10:12:23] <arc_> in this instance
[10:12:27] <hellyeah> taplar:  what do you mean?
[10:12:29] <arc_> this extremely basic instance
[10:12:40] <taplar> stick some nested html in your element and try it
[10:12:52] <hellyeah> ic
[10:13:22] <hellyeah> how text() and html() are n ot same thing
[10:13:28] <taplar> i just told you
[10:13:54] <Ales> hellyeah use .html and .text
[10:13:54] <taplar> text() escapes the html so that it will not be interpreted as anything but a string
[10:13:57] <Ales> .text is outdated...
[10:14:03] <taplar> no, text is fine
[10:14:08] <taplar> they serve different purposes
[10:14:19] <Ales> .html = innerHtml right..?
[10:14:22] <taplar> yes
[10:14:26] <Ales> so use .html
[10:14:32] <taplar> sometimes you need text()
[10:14:41] <Ales> its not popular .text i read on jquery
[10:14:47] <taplar> idc, lol
[10:14:48] <arc_> he hasn't really said what he needs it to do
[10:15:03] <taplar> sometimes you need to show your markup without it rendering
[10:15:06] <taplar> text() does that
[10:15:09] <hellyeah> just try to understand
[10:15:09] <taplar> popular or not
[10:15:14] <Ales> why would someone use text lol.. you have all text in divs anyway ! or append to body
[10:15:23] <taplar> i just said why
[10:15:31] <Ales> ok.
[10:15:53] <Ales> i dont understand markup withour it rendering
[10:15:56] <Ales> what does it mean?
[10:16:15] <taplar> rendering is when the browser displays your html normally
[10:16:40] <taplar> displaying without rendering would be the html as plain text, nothing else
[10:16:56] <hellyeah> humm
[10:17:14] <hellyeah> rendering results in user interface
[10:17:24] <hellyeah> without rendering is just plain html code
[10:17:34] <taplar> plain text
[10:17:42] <taplar> that just happens to represent html code
[10:18:06] <hellyeah> right
[10:18:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/z4r3c7dg/
[10:19:07] <Ales> ah.... taplar now i understand
[10:19:14] <Ales> maybe its good if you have tutorial website lel
[10:19:25] <hellyeah> aha
[10:19:43] <hellyeah> good one
[10:55:05] <sdubois> How do i make $('#edit-submit-advpoll-118') so it selects every #edit-submit-advpoll ?
[10:55:20] <Cork> sdubois: by not using an id
[10:55:30] <Cork> ids are unique and can only exist once in the dom
[10:55:39] <Cork> if you want multiple, use a class
[10:55:56] <sdubois> theres no wildcard in jquery selectors?
[10:56:09] <Cork> sure, but an id by definition can only match one element
[10:56:24] <Cork> ah, sorry you wanted everything starting with that
[10:56:30] <sdubois> yes
[10:56:32] <Cork> sdubois: well the answer is still the same
[10:56:46] <Cork> cause you would have to resort to attribute search (slow) as id is id
[10:56:48] <sdubois> $("[id^=edit-submit-advpoll]")
[10:56:50] <sdubois> will that work?
[10:57:00] <Cork> yes, but it will be the second slowest selector you can make
[10:57:07] <taplar> full dom scan
[10:57:10] <Cork> ya
[10:57:18] <sdubois> SHIP IT
[10:57:24] <Cork> what you REALLY should do is add a class
[10:57:31] <Cork> it is how the dom is constructed to work
[10:58:06] <Cork> selecting multiple elements by class is close to the same speed as selecting by id
[10:58:18] <Cork> there really isn't a reason to not go that way
[10:58:50] <Cork> (except the web dev community is dead drunk on ids for some reason)
[10:58:59] <taplar> :)
[10:59:08] <taplar> my qa's too
[10:59:11] <Cork> i think i normally use like 4-5 ids in a page
[10:59:19] <Cork> and like 100000 classes :)
[11:00:37] <Cork> hmm actually that's wrong
[11:00:43] <Cork> i use lots of ids in forms
[11:00:50] <Cork> cause they want it
[11:00:54] <Cork> but that's about it
[11:01:12] <taplar> we use a ton of ids, cause our testing suite really doesn't like classes that much
[11:01:21] <taplar> to my frustration
[11:01:22] <Cork> ouch
[11:01:36] <Cork> luckelly mine works find with dom relation and any css selector
[11:01:43] <taplar> what do you use?
[11:01:43] <Cork> *fine
[11:02:01] <Cork> mainly the built in test suite in ror
[11:02:15] <taplar> ah
[11:02:26] <Cork> the other servers doesn't have a web front end so doesn't need css selectors
[11:02:41] <Cork> (or are too static to bother with tests)
[11:03:35] <taplar> i really wanted our qa's to go to Geb, but they are not the most technically inclined and don't want to learn it
[11:04:10] <Cork> i've thought about playing with different type of testsuites using phantom.js
[11:04:22] <Cork> but haven't digged too far into that
[11:04:49] <taplar> i'm pretty sure we use that paired with jasmine
[11:04:53] <taplar> for our pipelines
[11:05:02] <Cork> plenty do
[11:05:16] <Cork> it is basically the only automated browser on the market currently :)
[11:05:32] <Cork> the rest just emulate small parts
[11:08:22] <taplar> our functional test suite is built on top of sahi, so it uses what ever real browser you tell it to
[11:08:42] <Cork> how do they automate a real browser?
[11:08:45] <taplar> sorry, integration
[11:09:01] <Cork> emulating system keypresses and mouse actions?
[11:09:12] <taplar> you give them the browser program location and it automates all the mouse clicks and keyboard inputs
[11:09:26] <Cork> ah
[11:09:47] <Cork> that means it requires a server with a head though...
[11:09:51] <taplar> it's mostly emulated, however there are a couple classes you can use to make it do actual mouse/keyboard interactions
[11:09:55] <taplar> yup
[11:10:06] <taplar> it's a full live integration test
[11:10:15] <Cork> phantom works on a headless server
[11:10:19] <Cork> and that's really nice
[11:10:54] <Cork> i've used it to automate downloading of files from sites that actively trying to prevent that :D
[11:11:01] <taplar> lol
[11:11:30] <Cork> hard to distinguis if it actually behaves like a normal browser ^^
[11:12:18] <taplar> i haven't gone that far yet, though I have had various flash downloaders and in one case a screen capturing program
[11:13:21] <taplar> for a while i had a script randomly playing various webm's i downloaded from youtube so I wouldn't be using so much bandwidth at work
[11:13:43] <Cork> ya, youtube-dl ftw there :)
[11:14:00] <Cork> though i'm sitting on a 100gbit connection so...
[11:14:04] <Cork> we don't really care XD
[11:14:52] <taplar> it was more of an over site on my end.  they were pretty anal about internet usage for a while.  seeing if you were playing or working or what not
[11:15:56] <Cork> ah, that is forbidden by law here
[11:17:00] <Cork> and the person snooping on other workers traffic can get into serious problems
[11:17:35] <Cork> anyway gtg
[11:23:20] <phelix> Could someone tell me why $(this) looses its selection while inside .then() https://jsfiddle.net/drzcqjn2/ ?
[11:24:06] <taplar> inside then() your changing context
[11:24:18] <taplar> each function(){} has its own then
[11:24:22] <taplar> err, 'this'
[11:24:33] <phelix> Is it possible to get the same info from the .each into the .then?
[11:24:50] <taplar> sure, you can store the this in another variable and use that variable in the then
[11:25:10] <taplar> or use the argument passed in on the each for the element
[11:25:19] <phelix> I tried doing var element = $(this); and the passing that into the .then function but didn't seem to work
[11:25:38] <taplar> you wouldn't pass it.  just use it.  it's still in scope with in the nested then
[11:25:45] <phelix> can't do that because there are to many elements that are the samea nd it needs to use the exact one its currently on
[11:25:51] <phelix> ohh
[11:26:07] <taplar> the var on element would make it distinct for each iteration
[11:27:08] <phelix> There we go. was easier than I thought. thanks!
[11:27:13] <taplar> sure
[11:42:25] <baako> hi guys anyone happened to use the footable library before
[12:10:53] <jquery804> john resig
[12:23:52] <persina> How do I find the next element with a specific class name?
[12:25:55] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:35:36] <thoraxe> https://jsfiddle.net/Lmse4jfo/9/ -- so i'm trying to "reuse" stuff, but in this case even with no failure of the actual .get the failsequence() function is being run
[12:36:33] <taplar> take off the ()
[12:42:25] <thoraxe> take off the () inside the .fail ?
[12:42:28] <thoraxe> or in the function definition
[12:42:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lmse4jfo/10/
[12:43:20] <taplar> fail() take a function definition as an argument.  someFunction() with () executes that function
[12:47:20] <thoraxe> taplar: so that works, and i see the failure console log message, but for some reason it doesn't update the div
[12:48:22] <thoraxe> ohhh
[12:48:23] <thoraxe> the p is gone
[12:48:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lmse4jfo/11/ <-- jQuery wasn't included in the fiddle
[12:48:32] <persina> taplar: That only works if it is the immediate next tag.  In my case it is not necessarily the next tag...
[12:49:02] <thoraxe> so maybe i am misunderstanding the .html tag
[12:49:12] <thoraxe> .html is going to replace the ELEMENT or replace the contents of the element
[12:49:17] <taplar> contents
[12:49:27] <thoraxe> $("#messages .message-container p").html(result.response); <-- this seems to be knocking off the paragraph element
[12:49:40] <persina> taplar: I need to find the next tag that has a certain class but it doesn't have to be the next immediate tag.
[12:49:46] <taplar> thoraxe: it doesn't in that fiddle
[12:50:08] <thoraxe> hmm
[12:50:42] <thoraxe> ok i'llr ebuild it
[12:50:44] <thoraxe> time to make lunmch
[12:50:45] <thoraxe> thanks again
[12:50:46] <thoraxe> wow typos
[12:51:30] <taplar> persina: you might try nextAll() then and just get the first one
[12:51:41] <taplar> not sure of a single operator that will do what your wanting
[12:54:16] <persina> taplar: OK, thanks.
[13:02:28] <FishBit> Hello, users of jQuery. Recently, I gone ahead and tried migrating to jQuery 3.0.0. A problem I went up-on is to do with 'document ready' and .on().
[13:03:43] <FishBit> In my web application, the element selected by .on() would be removed and replaced with other content when navigating to other places.
[13:04:40] <FishBit> Going back to the page with the element it selects and attempting to trigger the event set would not work. I am aware of why this is the case.
[13:05:40] <FishBit> I tried going with things such as: $(document).on('tapone', '.action', function(e) { ... });
[13:06:17] <FishBit> (Yes, it also uses jGestures. Main reason because jQuery Mobile is pretty much dead on jQ3.)
[13:06:54] <FishBit> Actually, that was before and during the migration.
[13:07:06] <FishBit> $().on('tapone', '.action', function(e) { ... });
[13:07:25] <FishBit> that was also tried but I had no luck,
[13:19:56] <taplar> looks like jGestures was last updated in 2012
[13:21:31] <FishBit> taplar: yup, though that does not look to be the one causing the issue..
[13:21:58] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing what your trying?
[13:26:03] <FishBit> could do. I'll see if I can set it up..
[13:39:20] <FishBit> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/145th7pL/
[13:39:53] <taplar> uh, $() isn't going to do anything dude
[13:40:56] <taplar> your creating a jQuery object with an empty stack
[13:42:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/145th7pL/1/
[13:43:27] <VectorX> is cookies built into jquery or do you need to use a plugin ?
[13:44:37] <taplar> plugin it looks like
[13:44:40] <VectorX> ok
[13:44:48] <FishBit> oh got it
[13:44:53] <FishBit> https://jsfiddle.net/145th7pL/
[13:45:01] <taplar> VectorX: are you trying to implement cookies from scratch?
[13:45:16] <FishBit> do: add > remove > click on 'added'
[13:45:27] <taplar> FishBit: does nothing for me
[13:45:39] <FishBit> oh and then add it back before clicking
[13:46:15] <VectorX> taplar on a blog im trying to use cookies on a per page basis so when a user comes to the page based on there preference the page will have content
[13:46:30] <VectorX> s/there/their/
[13:46:30] <b-ot> Correction, <VectorX> taplar on a blog im trying to use cookies on a per page basis so when a user comes to the page based on their preference the page will have content
[13:46:42] <taplar> VectorX: so you don't currently have cookies your trying to start using.  your trying to add cookies
[13:46:51] <VectorX> yes
[13:47:02] <taplar> i'd suggest taking a look at localStore and/or sessionStorage then
[13:47:08] <taplar> *localStorage
[13:47:18] <FishBit> the issue in the example would be that '.samp2' can no longer be pressed on after being readded
[13:47:19] <VectorX> but wouldnt that be limited to html5 then ?
[13:47:30] <VectorX> in terms of compatibility
[13:47:52] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage  you can see the compatibility chart there
[13:48:02] <taplar> and fyi 'HTML5' is a buzz word
[13:48:24] <taplar> it's a living standard now, no number, :)
[13:49:09] <taplar> FishBit: i really don't see how that would ever work.  like i said, $() creates a jquery object with an empty stack
[13:49:09] <FishBit> basically, I'm trying to get it to say 'clicked' after removing and adding again without reloading anything
[13:50:22] <fancy> hey guys, I'm using jquery.toggle() to hide and display an element
[13:50:34] <fancy> It has a nice animation and everything is fine
[13:50:47] <fancy> BUT, how come the children of the element are also hiding in an animated way?
[13:50:49] <thoraxe> so, i tweaked this a little but, but it appears that even with no failure we are still calling failsequence: https://jsfiddle.net/Lmse4jfo/12/
[13:50:56] <fancy> I'd like to stop those from animating.
[13:51:10] <thoraxe> the button click in the fiddle is not going to work for sure
[13:51:26] <thoraxe> but when i run it in my test environment, i see the failure function being called and then the regular successful stuff happens, too
[13:51:27] <VectorX> taplar is that built into jquery or is vanilla js
[13:51:27] <taplar> dude, i told you to take off the () on the method thoraxe
[13:51:37] <taplar> VectorX: those storages are vanilla
[13:51:38] <FishBit> taplar: Oh dear. You are right.
[13:51:48] <VectorX> taplar ok, looks like its better than cookies
[13:51:52] <taplar> :)
[13:51:52] <VectorX> i havent used it yet
[13:51:58] <VectorX> ill look into it
[13:52:01] <FishBit> I was referring to this: https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#deprecated-document-ready-handlers-other-than-jquery-function
[13:52:12] <thoraxe> taplar: so i'm trying to pass through the arguments that .fail got called with. i realized i wasn't using any arguments on failsequence, but I guess it's the same problem?
[13:52:33] <FishBit> Using $(document) did the trick in that example. Just going to try in the real thing here..
[13:52:39] <taplar> fail() needs a reference to a function
[13:52:47] <taplar> you are executing your function, not giving it the reference
[13:53:04] <taplar> and the result of that function call is not another function reference, which would be valid
[13:53:18] <taplar> in any case, by doing functionName() you are immediately executing it
[13:54:36] <taplar> fancy: can you show in a fiddle what your doing?
[13:54:38] <thoraxe> ok that makes sense. so how would i make a reusable sequence of events that can be called from within .fail that i can also pass args to? because if I just call failsequence the args that came into .fail seem to be lost
[13:54:58] <taplar> couple ways, lets see
[13:55:05] <thoraxe> i guess i'm stuck in rubyland
[13:55:13] <fancy> taplar, I can't really show a fiddle, but I can describe it?
[13:55:26] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[13:55:29] <VectorX> taplar you know a tute i can follow to change pages as this while you scroll down http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/eu-referendum-the-first-100-days-of-brexit
[13:55:57] <fancy> I have a panel that I want to collapse and expand on a button click. I'm using $("#myPanel").toggle(250), to collapse and expand the panel everytime the button is pressed.
[13:56:11] <fancy> But for some reason, this also animates the children of the panel
[13:56:24] <taplar> VectorX: not off hand, though i've seen that scrolling side bar thing before, but forget where, :(
[13:56:27] <fancy> I'd like the children not to be animated.
[13:56:39] <FishBit> taplar: Just tested and it works. Big thanks. :)
[13:57:57] <taplar> fancy: i'd have to see it in action.  it may be that it has to animate the children
[13:59:29] <jak2000> how to change: $.ajax({   NO ASYNC  to ASYNC?
[13:59:35] <taplar> dont
[13:59:41] <taplar> oh wait
[13:59:54] <taplar> if you don't have async: false, it's already async
[14:01:21] <taplar> the async option though is deprecated since 1.8 though
[14:03:54] <jak2000> taplar, remember my problem: http://pastie.org/10876608#
[14:04:11] <jak2000> line 58,59,60 was executed first......
[14:04:40] <jak2000> than.... lines under done: 27,28,29,30,31,32,33   :(
[14:05:03] <taplar> the loop will happen first, just that the lines after are not going to wait on your ajax to finish
[14:05:14] <jak2000> yes i UnfixedSNIPERJderstand
[14:05:29] <jak2000> if chenge the ajax execution?
[14:05:39] <jak2000> *yes i understand
[14:07:37] <taplar> take a look at this guy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[14:09:05] <jak2000> ok
[14:09:55] <jak2000> eich is better: $.when( $.ajax( "/page1.php" ), $.ajax( "/page2.php" ) ).done  or $.when( $.ajax( "/page1.php" ), $.ajax( "/page2.php" ) ).then   ?
[14:10:25] <jak2000> *wich
[14:12:04] <taplar> iirc, done() wraps the good case of then().  then() allows you to define good and bad cases
[14:13:47] <jak2000> ok, understand thanks
[14:17:30] <taplar> it's slightly concerning though that your doing all that appending to the body, but your refreshing the page at the end
[14:23:37] <jak2000> with reload?
[14:23:53] <taplar> window.location.reload();
[14:39:14] <docmur> I'm trying to get the text " find this " when I change the select box, this is what I have now: https://jsfiddle.net/0Lcxhow7/
[14:40:03] <taplar> what have you tried?
[14:41:00] <docmur> God it actually
[14:41:51] <docmur> added and Id field and did this: var data =  selectVersion.closest('table').find('#mac').text();
[14:42:33] <taplar> your going to run into issues if your going to have multiple of those later
[14:43:21] <taplar> you could keep it a class, find your closest tr, then find that class
[14:43:47] <docmur> Ya, just have to change the tags
[14:44:25] <docmur> var data =  selectVersion.closest('tr').find('.maccell').text();
[15:45:35] <Diplomat> Hey guys, does anyone know a lib that can do something like this? http://screencast.com/t/ifH631ze8aD2 (video from gliffy.com) like draw lines between boxes and things?
[15:46:22] <codecutter> how would you get an instance of window object for the pop to begin with? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8309557/closing-oauth-2-0-popup-window-after-redirect
[15:46:43] <codecutter> if that makes any sense...
[15:49:00] <codecutter> anyone?
[16:01:11] <alluringme> In theory, pass a var say x=0 while you redirect and set x=1 post successful redirect. If x is 1, handle close. If that makes any sense ;P
[16:02:38] <alluringme> But, if I read it again, I sound like utter nonsense lmao. j/k excuse me.
[16:02:55] <Es0teric> quick question
[16:04:35] <Es0teric> why is it that when i click on a table cell, it doesnt empty? https://jsfiddle.net/fmjrrp8w/
[16:04:43] <Es0teric> and then add the "down" text
[16:08:02] * alluringme drunk souls try to answer: https://jsfiddle.net/fmjrrp8w/1/ <
[16:09:16] <Es0teric> alluringme thats not answering my question though..
[16:10:01] <alluringme> You want to empty the clicked cell and add a "down" text?
[16:11:57] <Es0teric> nvm i figured it out
[16:16:54] <thoraxe> so this is probably a dumb question, but .get waits for a response... but what if I just want to hit the remote URL and I know there will never be a response? I just want to hit the remote URL and then keep on trucking
[16:23:09] <thoraxe> or in other wodrs what jquery/javascript function could I use to hit a remote URL and *not* wait for a response
[16:23:45] <sillyslux> .get and set timeout to 0 or 1ms
[16:24:46] <thoraxe> i don't see a timeout option on .get
[16:25:52] <sillyslux> try $.get({url:'/',timeout:1})
[16:26:29] <sillyslux> has to be 1, not 0
[16:26:43] <sillyslux> gives me XHR failed loading
[16:30:07] <sillyslux> (and a cancelled request)
[16:35:09] <thoraxe> sillyslux: having a problem with the syntax.
[16:35:10] <thoraxe> $.get({url:"/ws/demo/killapp",timeout:1})
[16:35:21] <thoraxe> this results in an error where the URL is an "object" and not actually a string
[16:36:05] <heizenberg> Hello again, how can I use the `from` variable inside start in update here is pastebin url http://laravel.io/bin/NkerV
[16:36:40] <thoraxe> the .get docs suggest an array goes there
[16:36:42] <thoraxe> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[16:37:25] <sillyslux> settings Type: PlainObject
[16:38:25] <thoraxe> yeah not following. i just know that the URL being generated is broken given that syntax.
[16:38:34] <thoraxe> jquery-2.1.4.min.js:4 GET http://localhost:8080/[object%20Object]
[16:38:46] <thoraxe> as opposed to http:......../ws/demo/killapp
[16:39:14] <thoraxe> i had this problem the other day when i tried to use the settings syntax
[16:40:49] <sillyslux> with jquery 1.12 there's no error
[16:41:00] <sillyslux> well wait
[16:41:06] <thoraxe> the error is not coming from *jquery*
[16:41:07] <sillyslux> i tried that inside an iframe
[16:41:18] <thoraxe> and i'm using 2.1.4
[16:41:38] <thoraxe> the issue is that it's compiling the total URL but not actually using the string part as a string, but rather an object
[16:44:57] <sillyslux> i get an url with [object%20Object] 404 (Not Found) in jquery 1.11.3
[16:45:50] <sillyslux> with jq 1.12 there's no error
[16:47:09] <sillyslux> 2.x all give me that error
[16:48:03] <sillyslux> ahrrg no 2.2.3 is ok
[16:48:48] <sillyslux> 2.2.0 is ok, 2.1.4 has that error idk
[16:51:12] <sillyslux> oh reading is ... hard
[16:51:35] <sillyslux> jQuery.get( [settings ] ) version added: 1.12/2.2 settings Type: PlainObject
[16:52:23] <sillyslux> so either you use $.ajax or update your jquery
[16:54:54] <alluringme> sillyslux, perfect timing to crack a 404 pj. Elsewhere on Freenode "<alluringme>Error404NotFound, just for fun(no hard feelings), you are such a pain in bu** on interweb. lol" he/she: "<Error404NotFound>alluringme I love you too :)"
[16:56:10] <sillyslux> um whaat?...
[16:56:46] <alluringme> Erm, it was contextual. < <sillyslux>i get an url with [object%20Object] 404 (Not Found) in jquery 1.11.3
[16:56:50] <alluringme> Nvm lol
[16:56:57] <sillyslux> :)
[17:14:10] <_TWG_> I'm hoping someone can help me here.  Currently I have it adding a class on focus and if it's not empty.  However I would like to add a different class to the field if it's not empty on blur and also when the page loads, if the input has anything in it, I would like the add the .input-filled class.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/pbhzr6aj/1/
[17:18:24] <_TWG_> aNYONE?
[17:22:35] <thoraxe> sillyslux: yeah i switched to .ajax -- works now
[17:22:37] <thoraxe> sillyslux++
[17:35:03] <sillyslux> thoraxe, you've seen that settings syntax was added in 2.2 and you're using 2.1.4?
[17:41:32] <alluringme> TWG, i was exploring. That's what you are looking for? Others will correct it if I am wrong. Just something I did - https://jsfiddle.net/pbhzr6aj/6/

[20:00:39] <WhirledPress> pasting multiple times is just gonna make people angry. fyi.
[20:00:51] <WhirledPress> what is the id that you are getting returned?
[20:02:01] <WhirledPress> perhaps you could paste a not-working example complete with the html (or part of the html) so we can help. Try jsfiddle.net
[20:07:33] <heizenberg> I'm sorry
[20:10:27] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/u99crzxz/
[20:12:45] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/u99crzxz/1/
[20:16:17] <WhirledPress> wow. #jquery used to be just amazing. So many people in here cutting up and having a good time while helping folks...now it's a ghost town.
[20:16:46] <snover> when was that?
[20:17:40] <WhirledPress> YEAH...maybe it has been a couple years. I'm getting old, years fly by
[20:22:22] <heizenberg> @WhirledPress this is the link of the jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/bdrdt2jL/4/
[20:22:48] <WhirledPress> I know there is a simple reason why I am unable to use local variables in my callbacks: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/8zVTR/20/
[20:23:28] <heizenberg> I can get the ID element of the Element that I'm moving but can't get the Element ID that is where I want to put the new Element
[20:24:43] <WhirledPress> when you say where you want to put the element, that doesn't make sense, really.
[20:26:30] <heizenberg> @WhirledPress for example the items looks like a box [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
[20:26:57] <heizenberg> I can place [1] in slot of [3]
[20:27:34] <heizenberg> so this will happen to the order [2] [3] [1] [4] [5]
[20:28:55] <heizenberg> When I start dragging the [1] I can get the element id (line 5 in jsfiddle javascript)
[20:29:45] <heizenberg> What I want is to get the element id of [3] that was just replaced by [1]
[20:30:24] <heizenberg> When I start dragging the [1] I can get the element id (line 19 in jsfiddle javascript)
[20:30:45] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/u99crzxz/2/
[20:32:28] <WhirledPress> I think you are looking for something like this:$("ui.item").parent().find("li").eq(sort_to).attr("id");  but there's is undoubtedly a better way
[20:34:02] <WhirledPress> no quotes around ui.item, sorry.  more like var replacedItem=  ui.item.siblings().eq(sort_to); console.log(replacedItem.prop("id"));
[20:34:59] <WhirledPress> the sort_to and sort_from variables are storing the index where the item is being dropped and from where it started.
[20:36:04] <heizenberg> @WhirledPress
[20:36:05] <WhirledPress> to select an element by index, find it's siblings().eq(someIndex); then use .prop('id'); to get its id.
[20:36:28] <heizenberg> I will tinker a little I'm newbie in jquery LOL
[20:36:55] <heizenberg> Thank you I will test the code again
[20:39:02] <WhirledPress> heizenberg, none of your elements have ids to begin with
[20:40:28] <WhirledPress> try using "car1" instead of 1 for the ids
[20:40:49] <sillyslux> maybe he meant index?
[20:40:54] <WhirledPress> that way you won't bget confused between index (which is always numeric) and id (which is always string?)
[20:41:11] <WhirledPress> He wants to get the id based on the index
[20:41:21] <sillyslux> hm
[20:41:30] <WhirledPress> but because his ids look like indeces, it's impossible to guess
[20:42:53] <heizenberg> I want to get the id and the index
[20:43:07] <heizenberg> the id is from the database
[20:44:09] <heizenberg> I want to compare the index and the id to save to the database so that the drag n drop will persist
[20:46:19] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/bdrdt2jL/8/
[20:47:23] <WhirledPress> if the id (string) is generated from a database, I would prefix the id with a string identifier to keep it separate from the index..."1"!==1
[20:49:41] <WhirledPress> to select by index (which is always a number) use $(groupselection).eq(index);  the ID is a string identifier unique to that element.
[20:52:09] <heizenberg> This is the new fiddle looks like it is getting the string Car + the number
[20:52:10] <heizenberg> https://jsfiddle.net/bdrdt2jL/10/
[20:52:55] <WhirledPress> Here's the problem:
[20:53:06] <WhirledPress> inside each of those functions, ui.item is the same thing
[20:54:54] <WhirledPress> so when you say sort_to_id=ui.item.attr("id")...you will get the same ID as you did in start...every time.
[20:55:35] <WhirledPress> but see how you get the sort_to and sort_from numbers right? That's the index of the element (the place in the list).
[20:57:52] <heizenberg> Yes. I want the origin(id, index) and the destination(id, index) to compare to the database.
[20:58:22] <heizenberg> Is that correct approach?
[21:03:53] <WhirledPress> you see that the ID parameter is always the same because the one you are moving from origin  to destination is the same one
[21:04:20] <WhirledPress> the only  thing that changes is it's position (index)
[21:04:52] <heizenberg> Yes your right.
[21:07:50] <WhirledPress> I think there is a way to set it up where if you drag an element (say car 2) onto another element, they swap positions...so the element that was replaced takes the place of the moving element.
[21:08:20] <WhirledPress> rather than just scooting one up or down the list like it does now.
[21:09:09] <heizenberg> I would love to see what your suggesting. :)
[21:09:34] <WhirledPress> If it's not built into sortable, it's easy to do. Gimme one second to look it up.
[21:15:33] <heizenberg> Its fine maybe I learn more about jQuery :)
[21:17:23] <WhirledPress> you could just use jquery swappable. Google it. It's a simple script that does what you are asking, I think.
[21:22:21] <sillyslux> heizenberg, https://jsfiddle.net/bdrdt2jL/12/
[21:24:05] <heizenberg> What a clean code implementation you got ther s@illyslux
[21:24:17] <heizenberg> @sillyslux ***
[21:31:04] <heizenberg> @sillyslux
[21:31:05] <heizenberg> sillyslux
[21:31:05] <heizenberg> @sillyslux tmp = $("#sortable").sortable("toArray").filter(i=>i);
[21:31:14] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/bdrdt2jL/13/
[21:31:19] <heizenberg> What is that piece of code does?
[21:31:53] <sillyslux> $("#sortable").sortable("toArray") returns an array that looks like ["2", "", "3", "4", "1", "5"]
[21:32:21] <sillyslux> .filter removes the empty string "" from placeholder
[21:32:48] <heizenberg> I see. just like array_pluck() in php
[21:33:10] <sillyslux> pluck?!
[21:33:13] <sillyslux> :D
[21:33:32] <sillyslux> pluck that s**t
[21:33:57] <heizenberg> >.<
[21:34:11] <heizenberg> I'll go check your work
[21:34:31] <heizenberg> So I'll learn something :)
[21:36:10] <heizenberg> Maybe the $.ajax call will be inside the update: function(event, ui) {}
[21:37:23] <heizenberg> or Inside stop: function(event, ui) {} is OK?
[21:40:18] <sillyslux> i guess that makes no difference
[21:41:15] <sillyslux> maybe it does if you have multiple lists and items can move between, idk
[21:43:50] <heizenberg> You deleted the other variables that holds the element that is being dragged
[21:44:13] <heizenberg> The origin(index, id) destination(index, id)
[21:44:53] <sillyslux> put back what you need
[21:45:33] <heizenberg> (Y)
[21:47:16] <WhirledPress> sillyslux, if you do your sortables that way with thousands of items, will it still work. $("elem").sortable("toArray") has to create a new sortable then run the toArray method on that sortable, doesn't it?
[21:47:39] <sillyslux> idk
[21:47:46] <heizenberg> LOL
[21:47:56] <WhirledPress> So you are ending up with layers and layers of sortables
[21:48:13] <WhirledPress> when all that info is in the event
[21:48:37] <sillyslux> depends on the implementation
[21:48:45] <sillyslux> "Serializes the sortable's item id's into an array of string."
[21:49:34] <WhirledPress> the time it take to create a new sortable, run the toarray method, then filter the results for the index should ALWAYS take longer than var indx=ui.item.index();
[21:50:13] <sillyslux> $("elem").sortable("toArray") <- .sortable function is invoked with "toArray", i think that's a clear statement, if sortable isn't that stupid, it'll know that it doesn't have to initialize a full sortable, but return only that simple array
[21:51:18] <WhirledPress> The thing is, why even have parameters for tyhe callback then? THat's why they have function (event, ui) so you don't have to do all that
[21:51:30] <sillyslux> the alternative would be to create that array on initialization and then track the changes
[21:51:51] <WhirledPress> which is exactly what sortable does
[21:52:36] <WhirledPress> and the element being changed is passed to the callback on start, stop, update
[21:53:19] <WhirledPress> then, rather than recreating the sortable to run the array, use your cached reference and the "to array method"
[21:54:05] <heizenberg> Me... Reading... Pro Discussion...
[21:54:10] <WhirledPress> var mySortable=$("elem").sortable(opts); var myArray=mySortable("toArray"); is nearly instant. No sortable being recreated
[21:54:22] <sillyslux> sadly there's no index list in event, ui, this
[21:54:48] <WhirledPress> this is thejquery element being altered
[21:55:18] <WhirledPress> on the start callback you get ui.item.index();
[21:55:28] <WhirledPress> on the stop callback you get ui.item.index();
[21:56:24] <WhirledPress> so caching the sortable allows you to get the update array of items using the "toArray" method on an instance of the sortable
[21:58:20] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/bdrdt2jL/14/
[21:58:30] <sillyslux> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'toArray'
[21:58:43] <sillyslux> so no new sortable
[22:00:10] <sillyslux> $("elem").sortable("toArray") seems to return the index array sortable itself is tracking and caching
[22:11:39] <heizenberg> @WhirledPress @sillyslux hey guys you still there?
[22:14:04] <sillyslux> yep
