[00:05:54] <robertmaxrees> axilaris you said "i have similar code in here, but it works" - what's different between your site and the fiddle?
[00:06:02] <robertmaxrees> also: there's no jquery in that fiddle.
[00:06:22] <axilaris> https://jsfiddle.net/60hwceuy/1/ <-- this has jquery
[00:06:43] <axilaris> i removed and insert the jquery line
[00:06:44] <axilaris> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.x-git.min.js"></script>
[00:06:47] <axilaris> and it still works
[00:06:57] <robertmaxrees> not working in that fiddle for me.
[00:07:39] <axilaris> https://jsfiddle.net/60hwceuy/1/ <-- this does not work, you cant select the dropdown and click on the datepicker ?
[00:08:22] <robertmaxrees> chrome works, ff does not.
[00:09:01] <robertmaxrees> chrome as stopped working now.
[00:09:09] <axilaris> hmm... ok why does chrome works ?
[00:09:15] <robertmaxrees> seems to be a screen size issue.
[00:09:17] <axilaris> i dont have firefox
[00:09:23] <axilaris> let me try on safari
[00:09:26] <robertmaxrees> either way - this isn't a jquery problem.
[00:09:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a bootstrap/bootstrap plugin problem.
[00:09:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd go ask in a bootstrap related channel for help :)
[00:09:55] <axilaris> it does work on safari
[00:10:12] <axilaris> you think its bootstrap issue ?
[00:10:20] <axilaris> ok...
[00:10:34] <robertmaxrees> it seems based on viewport size.  you're not using jquery directly.
[00:10:42] <robertmaxrees> tells me it's a bootstrap issue, not a jq issue :)
[00:10:58] <axilaris> ok
[00:11:02] <axilaris> thanks
[00:19:26] <axilaris> @robertmaxrees somehow #bootstrap is invite only
[00:20:09] <axilaris> http://use.my/dynamicmap.html <-- i found something strange then, you are right on the sizing. if i resize the window width of chrome smaller. it works
[00:20:31] <axilaris> and if i expand chrome fullsized, i cant click on the drop down
[00:20:31] <robertmaxrees> you need a freenode account and to go to ##bootstrap
[00:20:41] <robertmaxrees> so do those and you'll be good to go!
[00:21:03] <axilaris> ok im in :)
[01:05:55] <Cork> axilaris: that is cause the channel is ##bootstrap not #bootstrap
[01:06:15] <axilaris> thanks Im in
[01:06:33] <Cork> ## is for unofficial channels in freenode and # is only for channels started by the company/organisation owning the name
[01:06:55] <Cork> (in this case facebook)
[01:07:14] <Robdgreat> they acquired it from twitter?
[01:07:19] <Robdgreat> I've been way out of the loop
[01:07:27] <Cork> damn your right mixed it up
[01:07:36] <Robdgreat> fb is react :)
[01:07:38] <Cork> was damn library was it facebook invented then...
[01:08:04] <Robdgreat> or I should have said react is fb
[01:08:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ fb maintains react.
[01:08:31] <Cork> hmm, doesn't feal like that lib i was thinking of, but ok :)
[01:09:23] <robertmaxrees> jest?
[01:09:35] <Cork> thats it!
[01:09:55] <Cork> react feels more like a language then a lib
[01:10:09] <Cork> with all its html tags in the script code...
[01:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking JSX - you can do react without that.
[01:11:41] <robertmaxrees> which is a js syntax extension.  since react encourages compoentization, it actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:59] <Cork> componentization makes sense, the syntax is ugly as nothing else though
[01:13:34] <robertmaxrees> i actually really, really didn't like it when i first saw it but it grew on me really quickly.
[05:13:13] <Acegi> Hi probably more of a javascript question but how would I store some information into an array from a jquery selector's .each method? Nearly every example use of .each() just writes directly into the html. What if I want to edit the results found from the jquery selector and output it in a different part?
[05:28:02] <Acegi> Nvm, I just converted the jquery selector into an array instead.
