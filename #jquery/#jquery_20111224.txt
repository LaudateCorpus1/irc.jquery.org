[01:29:03] <LordThumper> Is there a jQuery selector by text contents?
[01:29:15] <coldhead> ?:text
[01:29:16] <bot-t> :text: Selects all elements of type text. http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[01:29:23] <coldhead> ?:contains
[01:29:24] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[01:29:26] <LordThumper> thanks
[01:56:34] <surfdue> I am working on a function inside of a method of a instance of a object it seems when I get an error there is no error logging in atleast the chrome debugger, any way to show these errors?
[02:02:44] <pulse00> hi all. i'm trying to handle dragenter/dragleave events for the whole document. however, the events are triggered event if something is being dragged inside the document, between nested dom elements. here's how i'm binding the events: http://jsfiddle.net/n2eDh/1/  anyone an idea how to do this properly?
[02:02:44] <bot-t> (17 hours 20 mins ago) <Eviltwin> tell pulse00 http://jsfiddle.net/uDtMu/2/
[02:03:48] <pulse00> Eviltwin: thanks a lot.
[02:04:51] <pulse00> *triggered even* that should be
[02:11:03] <AdmittingZero> Hey, how can I search the children of a div for a specific element?
[02:11:16] <AdmittingZero> I'm trying to find the index
[02:12:05] <AdmittingZero> nvm got it, .index
[02:12:40] <LordThumper> Something like $("#div").children().each(function (index) { //code });
[02:14:19] <AdmittingZero> thanks I found the answer I was looking for. But it was more like:
[02:14:32] <AdmittingZero> $("#div").children().index($(this))
[02:14:51] <AdmittingZero> Ah, actually I could even take out .children()
[02:14:55] <AdmittingZero> $('.treetool-list').index($(this))
[02:19:49] <anddr> Hi guys. Could you please answer my question?
[02:20:27] <anddr> Is this possible to access widget's properties by field id which was transformed to the widget?
[02:21:08] <anddr> <input id="fff" type="text">
[02:21:26] <anddr> $('#fff').autocomplete()
[02:21:36] <anddr> How to access autocomplete methods after?
[02:31:40] <AdmittingZero> are you trying to define the methods for it?
[02:31:50] <anddr> Yes
[02:32:06] <AdmittingZero> have you checked under the 'events' tab in the JQuery documentation?
[02:32:08] <anddr> When I initialize autocomplete I am adding my own methods. I
[02:32:40] <AdmittingZero> oh you're adding your own methods already? I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish then.
[02:34:40] <anddr> I need to modify widget's behaviouw with my methods. I want to other widgets update this widget state (I need to supply new source data for autocomplete if some checkboxes are used)
[02:35:06] <anddr> BTW thank you for your questions :)
[02:35:16] <anddr> I am checking events tab now
[02:35:41] <AdmittingZero> No problem, I'll try to help you the best I can =P But I'm no guru
[02:36:59] <anddr> Wha tI am basically try to do now is to add a property or a method to autocomplete and access it by field name
[02:38:42] <MoTiOnXml> when extending a widget, is there a way in a overridden function to call the parent function?
[02:39:08] <MoTiOnXml> i mootools when extending a class, i could simply call this.parent() and i'm looking for the equivalent in jQuery widgets
[02:39:37] <AdmittingZero> JQuery has a .parent method as well, have you looked at that?
[02:39:51] <AdmittingZero> Anddr: I'm looking at MSDN docs http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh404085.aspx for you
[02:39:51] <MoTiOnXml> AdmittingZero: no, but it would make sense :)
[02:40:08] <AdmittingZero> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[02:40:21] <Pliop> hello
[02:40:32] <AdmittingZero> hey
[02:40:42] <MoTiOnXml> AdmittingZero: what? i'm talking about extending a widget, not DOM selectors
[02:40:49] <MoTiOnXml> AdmittingZero: wasn't that clear?
[02:41:12] <Pliop> can anyone please explain that to me? Hi, what I hate particulary is when people havenâ€™t understood how jQuery works and do stuff like this: $("a").each(function(){    $(this).css("color","red"); }); instead of doing this: $("a").css("color","red");
[02:41:24] <AdmittingZero> Oh I see, like super or base for JavaScript
[02:41:56] <AdmittingZero> I'm not sure then MoTiOnXml
[02:41:58] <MoTiOnXml> that's quite was i asked for
[02:42:03] <MoTiOnXml> what, even :)
[02:42:39] <surfdue> can anyone suggest a decent jquery framework for web apps? I have the php and all that already.. I just need something to help me properly load pages, notices, submit forms, etc.
[02:42:44] <dr0id> Pliop: huh?
[02:42:56] <surfdue> I am trying to peice togeather different plugins and its just wearing me out.
[02:43:51] <Pliop> dr0id: said by a person and i dont understand what he means
[02:44:14] <dr0id> lulz
[02:44:38] <Pliop> is it obsolete to use .each() if the result has multiple Elements?
[02:44:41] <AdmittingZero> Motion: how are you creating classes and inheritance with JQuery? Using $.extend?
[02:45:03] <dr0id> no but $('a').css('color', 'red'); will color all the 'a'
[02:45:18] <AdmittingZero> wouldn't it have to be #a or .a?
[02:45:27] <khan> no
[02:45:30] <dr0id> do you know what 'a' is ?
[02:45:35] <khan> #a targets all id's that are a
[02:45:39] <dr0id> ITS AN ANCHOR TAG LOL
[02:45:41] <AdmittingZero> oh, for anchors lol
[02:45:41] <khan> .a targets all elements with the class a
[02:45:42] <khan> lol
[02:45:50] <AdmittingZero> haha it's 3am man =P
[02:45:54] <ravenzz> surfdue maybe http://jquerytoolkit.com/
[02:46:03] <dr0id> merry christmas then
[02:46:06] <khan> I finally got a freaking interview tuesday anyone know whats the best way to prepare?
[02:46:16] <khan> its a front end job html/css js jquery
[02:46:23] <dr0id> just be confident
[02:46:36] <dr0id> and present as if you have all the idea
[02:46:56] <surfdue> ravenzz: ill look at it now, the thing thats bothering me is i am using routesjs and it uses some object.instance.method and inside of those method functions NO errors show up
[02:46:59] <dr0id> tell them you helped build jQuery back in 2006
[02:47:07] <khan> yeah im just worried last interview they said i was good but i didnt have enough experiance
[02:47:09] <surfdue> in the debug console in chrome, so I am trying to figure out why it just stops working :/
[02:47:13] <dr0id> and co-authored the w3c css specs
[02:47:16] <surfdue> any idea how to fix this?
[02:48:08] <ravenzz> and you are speck (the italian for bacon) addicted
[02:48:30] <dr0id> and build a website in 10mins using twitter boostrap (am sure they don't know about it yet)
[02:48:43] <ravenzz> and they will be impressed
[02:48:49] <surfdue> take a look at this code.. http://pastebin.com/h9Y3ftdX for example if I make a mistake on line 15 the entire script just dosnt run.. causing nothing to error or show in console.
[02:48:50] <dr0id> and you'll get the job
[02:48:55] <dr0id> WOAH!
[02:49:03] <surfdue> this is inside of a document ready
[02:49:07] <ravenzz> also you was the one that says "don't reset, normalize!"
[02:49:42] <dr0id> y u no use var :(
[02:49:49] <surfdue> dr0id: looks nice
[02:49:57] <ravenzz> ..
[02:50:49] <ravenzz> surfdue http://api.jquery.com/load/#example-1
[02:50:53] <dr0id> couldn't Page be an object instead of a function ?
[02:51:05] <surfdue> dr0id: all it needs is the database and i can clone twitster :P
[02:51:15] <Pliop> dr0id: Okay. If you execute a jquery Funktion on a jquery Object with multiple Elements, it'll be iterated and every Element in the matched set will be changed, right?
[02:51:29] <dr0id> yes, email them - support@twitter.com and I am sure they'll send you their DB
[02:51:42] <dr0id> Pliop: yes
[02:51:42] <surfdue> ravenzz: your taking my example to literal. I can put on line 14 something(); and instead of telling me that something dosnt exist
[02:51:46] <surfdue> it just kills itself.
[02:51:56] <dr0id> $('a') is an array
[02:51:57] <ravenzz> buh
[02:52:10] <surfdue> oh
[02:52:21] <surfdue> ravenzz: perhaps its becuase im using jquery's getscript
[02:52:26] <surfdue> oh foo.
[02:52:28] <Pliop> dr0id: but also a jquery object?
[02:52:46] <Pliop> or IS a jquery Object always an Array?
[02:53:09] <surfdue> ravenzz: nvm that fixed it -.-
[02:53:46] <ravenzz> if you need moar power use $.ajax
[02:53:51] <Pliop> if only One Element IS matched, you get an array as well?
[02:53:54] <dr0id> its a collection of JS objects
[02:54:33] <ravenzz> Pliop if not you are fuckd
[02:54:51] <dr0id> no
[02:55:07] <dr0id> well, yes
[02:55:08] <Pliop> okay, i have to read the manial
[02:56:39] <daslicht> hello friends!
[02:56:40] <Pliop> why is jquery so fucked up?
[02:56:58] <AdmittingZero> hey the light
[02:57:47] <daslicht> I have created a simple fade in out navigation , locally anything is working like a charm, but online the fadin/out is flickering between music and artists
[02:57:48] <daslicht> http://ansolas.com/kiss/
[02:57:58] <daslicht> anyone knw why this happens ?
[02:58:10] <daslicht> Heya AdmittingZero
[02:58:51] <dr0id> Pliop: what do you mean ?
[02:58:54] <daslicht> it seems not to happen anytime
[02:59:15] <daslicht> i even tried to slow down the animation but it still flickers
[02:59:37] <AdmittingZero> I don't see any animation. I open the page and click 'Play'
[03:01:12] <daslicht> there is a fade in / out when u navigate between Welcome and music etc
[03:01:32] <daslicht> teh content fades in /out
[03:01:36] <AdmittingZero> mmh, what browser are you using?
[03:01:50] <daslicht> its happening on firefox, chrome
[03:01:54] <daslicht> but locally not
[03:02:32] <dr0id> Pliop: its not an array really. it's a jquery object. it's a collection.
[03:02:50] <dr0id> tell you what, use the chrome dev tools and find out more.
[03:03:37] <AdmittingZero> Oh I see it now
[03:04:02] <daslicht> :)
[03:04:22] <daslicht> really strange
[03:04:57] <daslicht> looks like the faded out content is shown again for a millisecond after ist fade out
[03:05:48] <daslicht> now playing music should work , just uploaded the teasers :)
[03:06:19] <AdmittingZero> lol, yeah I see that, I'm looking at the JS
[03:07:17] <daslicht> thank you for your time !
[03:09:39] <AdmittingZero> This page (http://efreedom.com/Question/1-5967313/JQuery-Fade-Flickers) is saying to just animate the opacity instead
[03:09:54] <daslicht> cool I try it
[03:09:58] <daslicht> funny
[03:10:09] <daslicht> I did not do a google serach
[03:10:11] <daslicht> lol
[03:10:13] <AdmittingZero> =P
[03:24:29] <daslicht> still flickering
[03:24:30] <daslicht> http://ansolas.com/kiss/
[03:25:18] <dismist> the fuck we lookin at?
[03:25:19] <AdmittingZero> in firefox it doesn't seem to animate at all
[03:25:31] <daslicht> strange
[03:26:39] <daslicht> i slowed it down to 1000 ms, now its more obious
[03:26:44] <daslicht> obvious
[03:27:34] <someprimetime> so i want to attach event handlers inside of a loop... is it possible?
[03:27:38] <someprimetime> well, probably, but how
[03:27:49] <someprimetime> why did i just answer myself
[03:28:40] <dismist> why not
[03:30:41] <AdmittingZero> ah I see it now; I forgot to clear my cache before
[03:31:09] <AdmittingZero> after the fadeout finishes, but before loading the new content, why not try clearing the html?
[03:31:27] <AdmittingZero> the html of just the #content element
[03:31:45] <daslicht> how would I do this ?
[03:31:57] <AdmittingZero> $("#content").html("");
[03:32:01] <daslicht> I am quite new to jquery and js ::)
[03:32:10] <daslicht> ok i try that thanks
[03:32:19] <AdmittingZero> lol it's np, I'm pretty inexperienced with it too
[03:33:10] <daslicht> :)
[03:33:41] <coldhead> it's my first day with jq
[03:33:56] <coldhead> but i am doing my best
[03:35:02] <daslicht> ha ! that did the trick !
[03:35:04] <daslicht> :)
[03:35:15] <daslicht> try it
[03:35:20] <daslicht> now it looks smooth
[03:35:25] <daslicht> thank you very much !
[03:35:34] <shal3r> daslicht, you better start with learning JS without any frameworks :)
[03:35:47] <AdmittingZero> awesome!
[03:35:49] <AdmittingZero> np
[03:36:13] <AdmittingZero> this fix will probably work with .fadeout too, if you don't want to animate the opacity
[03:36:57] <daslicht> works like a charm
[03:38:32] <daslicht> i could do that the whole day
[03:38:35] <daslicht> fade in out
[03:38:40] <daslicht> ahh so great]
[03:40:07] <AdmittingZero> :)
[03:40:26] <daslicht> have u seen wakanda.org ?
[03:40:38] <daslicht> interesting stuff going on there
[03:40:50] <AdmittingZero> nah I haven't
[03:42:12] <MoTiOnXml> AdmittingZero: re: widgets i'm using the jQuery widget design pattern to extend
[03:43:13] <AdmittingZero> Wakanda looks pretty cool! I'll bookmark it for later
[03:43:36] <juha_> woot
[03:44:02] <shal3r> what's so cool about using JS for thing's that should not be done in JS?
[03:45:02] <daslicht> the whole package is nice
[03:45:17] <daslicht> u get a visual WYSIWYG IDE
[03:45:28] <daslicht> with visual data model and realtions editor
[03:45:46] <daslicht> the WAF framework also enables you to databind things
[03:45:50] <AdmittingZero> It's an interesting project man, why are you knocking it?
[03:45:52] <daslicht> very very nice
[03:46:20] <daslicht> since iam searching for alternative technologies to replace flex
[03:46:26] <daslicht> :)
[03:46:42] <daslicht> in the last weeks ive done massive research
[03:46:47] <coldhead> you can't have enough javascript
[03:46:49] <daslicht> i tried maannnny things
[03:46:53] <coldhead> it's everywhere now
[03:47:20] <daslicht> i hope more companies come up with better tools
[03:47:21] <coldhead> most popular language on github 2011 and you know what JSON is made from? 100% pure javascript
[03:47:33] <daslicht> :)
[03:48:11] <daslicht> google GWT loos quite nice as well
[03:48:15] <daslicht> looks
[03:48:23] <daslicht> but i am still not that convinced
[03:48:40] <AdmittingZero> @Motion: maybe something like this (http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/) will give you ideas?
[03:50:39] <daslicht> @<shal3r> I know AS3, JAVA, PHP etc so its not about "learning" javascript, its jut some js/jquery specific things
[03:50:41] <AdmittingZero> I thought JSON was just a way to structure data...?
[03:50:49] <AdmittingZero> like XML
[03:51:02] <daslicht> yes but without overhead
[03:51:17] <shal3r> daslicht, it's perfectly fine then :)
[03:51:20] <AdmittingZero> are we talking about JSON? What overhead could there be?
[03:51:22] <daslicht> yeah !
[03:51:32] <daslicht> not "too" painful :)
[03:52:21] <daslicht> the most annoying part of the story is html lol
[03:52:38] <shal3r> html is easy and fun
[03:52:53] <daslicht> yeah it is but quite limited
[03:53:20] <daslicht> compared for example to flashplatform
[03:53:24] <shal3r> how it's limited? it is what it is - some tags to structure your content
[03:53:43] <daslicht> in flash you can build your gui OOP like
[03:54:12] <daslicht> however , i have decided to move away from flash
[03:54:23] <daslicht> to not justify anytime myself why using flash
[03:54:24] <daslicht> :)
[03:54:39] <coldhead> even the official flash site is done in javascript now
[03:54:45] <daslicht> and the things which are going on at adobe are anything else than clear
[03:54:50] <daslicht> :)
[03:55:19] <daslicht> some time ago I have NEVER thought of coding js on Christmas
[03:55:20] <daslicht> lol
[03:55:26] <daslicht> and now I even enjoy it
[03:55:33] <daslicht> oh oh
[03:56:02] <coldhead> it's a very javascripty christmas
[03:56:08] <daslicht> :)
[03:56:26] <daslicht> something like adobe catalyst for javascript woudl be awesome
[03:56:50] <daslicht> multiple scenes which represent "pages" of a website
[03:57:02] <daslicht> and atht you can add things visually
[03:57:08] <daslicht> add transitions etc
[03:57:09] <daslicht> :)
[03:57:49] <daslicht> wakanda is quite close to this approach
[04:01:51] <RLa> how to implement excel-like self-calculating table, i.e something like <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>cell 1 + cell 2</td>?
[04:02:28] <RLa> it does not have to track data dependencies and may evaluate columns from left to right
[04:09:28] <surfdue> does .live support submit yet ?
[04:10:20] <coldhead> if you use on() instead of live() it will work with submit in most browsers
[04:10:47] <surfdue> even if the form was brought in through ajax?
[04:11:29] <surfdue> coldhead: thats pretty cool, is on the new live.
[04:12:30] <coldhead> on is the new live
[04:12:52] <coldhead> but it won't catch a submit event when you send data with ajax
[04:12:56] <coldhead> unless you tell it to
[04:13:04] <surfdue> hmm
[04:13:08] <surfdue> live use too i think
[04:13:29] <surfdue> infact live works fine, on dosnt
[04:13:34] <surfdue> atleast in chrome 14
[04:13:41] <surfdue> 15*
[04:13:49] <coldhead> are you using a recent jquery?
[04:13:56] <coldhead> on should do everything live does
[04:14:10] <coldhead> different syntax
[04:14:18] <coldhead> but same events
[04:14:56] <surfdue> yes
[04:15:14] <surfdue> i used the submit example on the on function page on jquery
[04:15:21] <surfdue> i have the latest jq & ui from google
[04:15:31] <surfdue> when i changed .on to .live it worked :P
[04:20:16] <juha_> if i remember correctly, on is more like delegate than live
[04:25:39] <datarecall> Morning
[04:26:04] <datarecall> any thoughts on why its not binding to the click event ? http://jsfiddle.net/pKCwZ/
[04:37:53] <juha_> first thought: because of hitler
[04:38:22] <juha_> second thought, regex broken?
[04:51:37] <surfdue> can someone look at my paste here http://pastebin.com/Dzbh0pgw for some reason I cant get jquery to loop through the json with each I am getting unexpected token errors
[04:51:43] <surfdue> identifier*
[04:53:55] <Woet> is there some plugin that mimics the accordion but allows multiple to be opened/closed at the same time?
[04:54:03] <Woet> or should i just do it myself with some onclick events
[05:03:03] <surfdue> This line has an invalid identifier? $.each(data.response, function(k, v) {
[05:03:06] <surfdue> where?
[05:04:39] <juha_> surfdue: most likely missing ; on previous line or something
[05:04:54] <surfdue> ya juha_ i just saw the elseif
[05:04:59] <surfdue> i didnt put a space use to php :(
[05:05:31] <daslicht> $.each(formatted.response, function(i, error) {
[05:05:38] <daslicht> for what do u need that i inside there ?
[05:05:52] <surfdue> i got it to work but its key value
[05:06:05] <surfdue> im looping through a response from json so the keys have values
[05:06:46] <daslicht> what happens if u take teh i out ?
[05:06:46] <surfdue> question is it bad to serialize a form on a production website as long as you have vaslidation in the backend?
[05:06:59] <surfdue> daslicht: the entire thing breaks cause I need the key.
[05:07:03] <surfdue> also the world ends.
[05:07:04] <daslicht> ok
[05:07:06] <surfdue> :P
[05:07:22] <surfdue> daslicht: callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement)
[05:07:44] <daslicht> ok
[05:08:01] <surfdue> I suppose if you ommit the I it will assume the only variable in there is the key and probably error since I believe it needs 2 vars.. not sure though
[05:10:12] <daslicht> maybe teh content of formatted.response is broken ?
[05:13:44] <surfdue> I should be able to loop through an array right?
[05:14:27] <daslicht> i dont know how the response looks like :/
[05:14:45] <daslicht> i just try to assist u in finding answers :)
[05:15:27] <daslicht> is response an array ?
[05:15:28] <surfdue> daslicht: i got it :)
[05:15:31] <daslicht> cool
[05:15:34] <iop_> hello. how can i get an object of all style like with this.style?
[05:15:45] <surfdue> it parsed into an array but ineeded to turn it into a json var b4 each
[05:16:06] <surfdue> its strange how jq.parseJSON dosnt turn it into a jquery array
[05:16:07] <daslicht> :)
[05:16:25] <daslicht> @iop  i haveno clue :)
[05:17:32] <surfdue> I should be able to access this object/array like array.code right? http://d.pr/zp2S
[05:17:52] <surfdue> jquery is telling me that array.code is undefined :/
[05:18:49] <daslicht> hm
[05:19:26] <daslicht> maybe try saving the array into a new var ?
[05:19:27] <surfdue> its probably array[code]
[05:19:28] <surfdue> let me see.
[05:20:11] <surfdue> nope..
[05:20:58] <iop_> what is equal to $($('input')[5]).show();
[05:20:59] <iop_> ?
[05:21:15] <surfdue> why are you doing it like that?
[05:21:26] <iop_> surfdue: how then?
[05:21:32] <surfdue> can you tell me what it is?
[05:21:43] <surfdue> im assuming your trying to select the 5th input
[05:21:49] <iop_> surfdue: match the sixth input elem and show it
[05:21:55] <surfdue> yes yes.
[05:22:19] <surfdue> you can use each, loop through each input and keep a count when you hit the one you want show it.
[05:22:24] <surfdue> or even animate the affect :)
[05:22:28] <iop_> nooo
[05:22:32] <surfdue> :O
[05:22:33] <iop_> in just one line please
[05:22:37] <iop_> there has to be a function
[05:22:39] <iop_> like first()
[05:22:43] <surfdue> ok 1 sec
[05:23:10] <surfdue> $("input:eq(6)").show();
[05:23:20] <surfdue> im sorry make that a 5.
[05:23:31] <iop_> okay, thanks
[05:23:33] <surfdue> iop_: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/#index
[05:23:41] <surfdue> iop_: now help me with my issue. :P
[05:24:13] <iop_> but there was another function to do just this
[05:24:43] <surfdue> i just fixed it :p
[05:24:58] <surfdue> iop_: you could do like .next.next.next.next
[05:25:06] <surfdue> lulz, just use eq its the suggested method.
[05:25:21] <surfdue> i dont even see how that [5] works properly i bet it breaks in firefox and ie
[05:25:22] <iop_> i guess it was slice()
[05:25:22] <daslicht> so there is an array inside  yourobjectname.response
[05:25:23] <daslicht> ?
[05:25:34] <surfdue> daslicht: nah i fixed it
[05:25:43] <daslicht> ahh cool
[05:25:44] <daslicht> !
[05:25:46] <surfdue> i needed to convert the array into jquery on the each not b4
[05:26:21] <daslicht> and now whats not working?
[05:27:04] <surfdue> daslicht: nothing yet but give me a few minutes...
[05:27:09] <surfdue> i know i can break something pretty fast :P
[05:28:15] <iop_> jQuery: there is a function for that
[05:30:16] <daslicht> hihi
[05:30:53] <daslicht> $().breakApp();
[05:30:56] <daslicht> lol
[05:31:13] <daslicht> i am having a showwer and a shave now
[05:44:30] <iop_> how can i execute a function immediately?
[05:45:19] <iop_> something like $('div').exec(function(){this.style.display='none'})
[05:48:29] <iop_> how can i execute a function immediately?
[05:48:30] <iop_> something like $('div').exec(function(){this.style.display='none'})
[05:49:11] <MysterOnyx> anyone good with jplayer?
[05:57:21] <Borkdude> I have a question. I have the book jQuery in Action and I'm trying the first "lab"
[05:57:31] <Borkdude> But in the console of Chrome I get this error:
[05:57:44] <Borkdude> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file://localhost/Users/Borkdude/Dropbox/2011-2012-1-2/2011-2012-2/HTML5cursus/jqia2.source/chapter2/dom.sample.html. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[05:57:55] <iop_> Borkdude: this is a restriction
[05:58:11] <iop_> google for chrome same origin parameter
[06:04:26] <fris> how would i attach a js function to a div currently i have <script type="text/javascript">yt.PresentVideos('recently_featured','',1);</script> i want to say have <div class="videolist"></div> and have the function append to that div
[06:05:18] <Uriziel> could you please explain me why function in load() is not called? http://droptable.co.cc/public/text/Screenshot-2011-12-24_15.04.30.txt
[06:05:26] <Uriziel> not called whtn image is properly loaded*
[06:05:32] <Borkdude> iop_: Is there a change I could make to this code to allow getting a local file? https://gist.github.com/1517392
[06:05:40] <surfdue> anyone know of a function to get the last few records from the console? I am using one but it makes it so they arnt displayed to me :(
[06:05:54] <Borkdude> iop_: I'm totally new to jquery, this is the first example from the book
[06:06:10] <iop_> Borkdude: just don't run it locally
[06:06:22] <iop_> maybe just a local server would help
[06:06:24] <iop_> like apache
[06:06:27] <iop_> i don't really know
[06:07:01] <Borkdude> iop_: I could host it in a public folder on Dropbox I guess ;)
[06:10:30] <iop_> Borkdude: i guess, the restriction only takes action, if you run the site with the file:///-prefix
[06:11:19] <iop_> how can i execute a function immediately?
[06:11:58] <Borkdude> iop_: by surrounding it with ( ... ) and then putting () behind it
[06:12:19] <Borkdude> (function() { alert('foo'); })()
[06:14:06] <iop_> Borkdude: okay, but i mean like
[06:14:09] <iop_> something like $('div').exec(function(){this.style.display='none'})
[06:15:05] <Borkdude> iop_: with each?
[06:16:12] <Borkdude> $('div').each(function(){..}); should do it
[06:16:51] <Borkdude> iop_: cool, hosting on Dropbox works http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3914693/jqia2.source/chapter2/lab.selectors.html
[06:17:14] <iop_> Borkdude: thanks, each did the trick
[06:18:40] <iop_> <Borkdude> (function() { alert('foo'); })()
[06:18:43] <iop_> what did you mean by that?
[06:20:03] <Borkdude> iop_: you can create an inline function which you call once
[06:20:24] <iop_> Borkdude: do you have an example?
[06:21:49] <fris> does it matter if i use ('#videolist').append(yt.showvideo('new')); or ('#videolist').html(yt.showvideo('new')); they both seem to do the same thing
[06:22:40] <Borkdude> iop_: I saw an example of it, but I'll have to search for it
[06:24:09] <Uriziel> how can I check if image load failed (i.e. image not found)
[06:24:10] <Borkdude> iop_: here it comes
[06:24:10] <Uriziel> ?
[06:25:34] <Borkdude> iop_: https://gist.github.com/1517414
[06:26:16] <Borkdude> iop_: here we define a function that is applied only once with jQuery as a parameter
[06:27:06] <Borkdude> iop_: I saw this in a course, I'm not totally sure why you wouldn't just write: jQuery.log = ...
[06:28:03] <iop_> thanks, i will look at it, Borkdude
[06:31:53] <Borkdude> iop_: read this page, http://simonwillison.net/2007/aug/15/jquery/ under the "The infamous $ function"
[06:32:03] <iop_> could anyone please explain this piece of code to me? https://gist.github.com/1517414
[06:33:49] <Borkdude> iop_: this is just a way of adding a utility function to $, but in some contexts $ is not bound to the jQuery function
[06:34:15] <Borkdude> iop_: so here $ is just the name of an argument to the function and we pass jQuery as the argument
[06:35:41] <Borkdude> iop_: I added some lines to clarify
[06:35:44] <Borkdude> https://gist.github.com/1517414
[06:36:36] <Borkdude> iop_: don't be confused by using $ as an argument name, it could have been just another name
[06:36:57] <Borkdude> gotta go now
[06:38:31] <iop_> can anyone explain, what the sense of (jQuery) at the end of some scripts is?
[06:48:42] <datarecall> im doing an ajax call every 5 seconds is there a way to stop that ajax call after 5 minutes ?
[06:50:29] <MysterOnyx> I'm asking this in here because I think my problem is variable scope with filename. Can you please read the short script in the 2nd post to see if filename is being read correctly in the ready event? http://groups.google.com/group/jplayer/browse_thread/thread/472abb29376cb77d#
[06:52:47] <surfdue> small quick issue, ive created an object of "default" options im using each after to set the objects to different vars and add new ones to the object from the users input. http://pastebin.com/P7eDXZ1h however the way I am doing it output[key] is actually resetting the output
[06:53:01] <surfdue> how can I make it just modify them? I tried output.key and output.[key]
[06:53:07] <surfdue> do I have to use eval ?
[06:57:20] <iop_> can anyone explain, what the sense of (jQuery) at the end of some scripts is?
[06:59:47] <iop_> surfdue: maybe a scope issue?
[07:00:07] <surfdue> iop_: i fixed it, I was setting it as a jq object..
[07:00:15] <surfdue> wtf sometimes they need to be sometimes not :p
[07:00:16] <iop_> okay
[07:00:46] <surfdue> there needs to be a magic function $.check(ANYJSVAR/OBJECT/ARRAY)
[07:00:54] <surfdue> and it makes it a jquery one or removes it from jquery
[07:00:57] <surfdue> :)
[07:07:23] <surfdue> iop_: would Site.console.concat(errors); immediately affect the Site global object or do I need to still do Site.console = Site.console.concat(errors);
[07:12:21] <iop_> surfdue: code?
[07:13:46] <surfdue> iop_: http://pastebin.com/G9z9Vb7K
[07:13:54] <surfdue> line in question is 40
[07:15:06] <sweb> how can i join multile array ?
[07:15:21] <dabear> ?mdc concat
[07:15:22] <bot-t> dabear, concat - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other array(s) and/or value(s). https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat
[07:15:30] <dabear> @sweb
[07:15:31] <sweb> i want to add {page: 2} to $('form').serialize();
[07:15:52] <dabear> sweb: addaa hidden input to the form
[07:15:52] <surfdue> sweb: concat
[07:16:12] <dabear> with name="page" and value="2"
[07:16:26] <Cork[home]> you can't concat that
[07:16:36] <Cork[home]> you need to use serializeArray
[07:17:21] <Cork[home]> $('form').serializeArray() + [{page: 2}] should work
[07:18:50] <surfdue> Cork[home]: i was answering the how do you join multiple arrays question, for that concat is perfectly suitabl.
[07:19:19] <iop_> surfdue: i don't know, sorry
[07:19:32] <surfdue> np
[07:19:37] <Cork[home]> surfdue: if you just want to join a value in an array + works just fine
[07:20:08] <surfdue> Cork[home]: i dont know I have my own problems.. <3 objects
[07:20:28] <Cork[home]> ok?
[07:20:47] <dabear> ?eval [{page: 2}]  + [{test: "bar"}] //wont work
[07:20:48] <bot-t> dabear: "[object Object][object Object]"
[07:20:49] <surfdue> Cork[home]: heh
[07:21:33] <surfdue> ?eval ['hi']
[07:21:33] <bot-t> surfdue: ["hi"]
[07:21:44] <surfdue> oh hey..
[07:23:12] <iop_> ?eval 1+1;
[07:23:13] <bot-t> iop_: 2
[07:23:29] <Cork[home]> hmm
[07:24:24] <surfdue> thats incorrect.
[07:26:12] <Cork[home]> looks like i must have mixed js with another language...
[07:26:55] <iop_> ?eval $(document);
[07:26:55] <bot-t> iop_: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[07:27:11] <Cork[home]> eval doens't have jquery or a document
[07:27:19] <iop_> why?
[07:27:43] <Cork[home]> its a js engin, they don't normally have a document
[07:27:49] <iop_> okay
[07:28:44] <tomasm-> hey, how can i merge two objects so if they have matching keys, the values in the 2nd object is preferred? $.merge(a,b) doesnt seem to work
[07:29:15] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: v = $.extend({}, b, a);
[07:29:16] <bot-t> tomasm-, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:29:17] <Cork[home]> opps
[07:29:22] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: b = $.extend({}, b, a);
[07:29:49] <tomasm-> ah, extend
[07:30:12] <tomasm-> why the first {} ?
[07:30:24] <Cork[home]> it builds the new object on the first parameter
[07:30:38] <Cork[home]> so if you don't have {}, it will replace the content in a
[07:30:40] <tomasm-> ok well if i wanted it into b anyway, why not just extend(b,a) ?
[07:30:58] <Cork[home]> that'll work :)
[07:31:15] <tomasm-> great!
[07:32:28] <Cork[home]> oh, wait sorry, i mixed it up
[07:32:39] <Cork[home]> the content in the first object is replaced with thats in the second
[07:32:56] <Cork[home]> so it should be ({}, a ,b), not the other way around
[07:40:13] <tomasm-> how can i see if an object has any elements and isnt null? would calling extend() and one item be null and the others an object cause issues? or would it silently ignore?
[07:57:27] <necromancer> tomasm-: you gotta check to make sure the object isn't null first...use if (typeof object != 'undefined')
[07:58:21] <necromancer> as far as seeing if it has elements...you can try `length` but i don't think it works on non arrays
[07:58:31] <necromancer> if it's null you really can't do anything with it though
[08:09:40] <vdclouis> could someone help me with a .active query problem? thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/xG4Wz/
[08:09:48] <vdclouis> *jquery
[08:15:24] <vsmith> hello
[08:15:24] <surfdue> anyone have any references for getting browsers to regognize your ajax login for passowrd saving
[08:15:28] <surfdue> modern browsers.
[08:16:18] <vsmith> i am getting an error with the jquery Easing plugin and I have not been able to solve it.
[08:16:50] <Borkdude> vdclouis: why are you removing "active" from anchors, but are adding it to one parent (li)?
[08:17:44] <vsmith> the error says:   jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[08:18:10] <vsmith> How do i make this plugin a function
[08:18:17] <vdclouis> Borkdude: isn't that the way to do it? This way you only have one active element at all given time
[08:19:12] <Borkdude> vdclouis: sorry, I read it wrong I think
[08:19:40] <vdclouis> anyway, it doesn't work :(
[08:20:15] <deltree_> alright, for years I refused to use jquery, but it seems it's a really good product, so I'm trying to learn it.  I'm having a lot of trouble.  I've got 2 tables in a div that coincide and I need to traverse from one row on one table to the same row on the other table.  can anyone explain that to me?
[08:27:08] <Borkdude> vdclouis: when I remove the "return false" it works for me
[08:29:13] <vdclouis> Borkdude: hmm, i've removed 'return false' but the text is only red when the is actually pressed, not after i release my mouse button...
[08:30:19] <Borkdude> vdclouis: I can't see that because the frame navigates away
[08:30:44] <vdclouis> http://jsfiddle.net/xG4Wz/1/
[08:31:15] <vdclouis> hmm, the border-bottom property does work now :/
[08:31:22] <vdclouis> but the color does not
[08:31:22] <Borkdude> vdclouis: this is the right behavior?
[08:31:33] <Borkdude> vdclouis: it becomes red when I press it
[08:31:45] <vdclouis> yes but not after you released it
[08:31:46] <Borkdude> vdclouis: and gets back the old color when I release it
[08:31:57] <vdclouis> yeah, i want it to stay red
[08:32:07] <Borkdude> vdclouis: isn't that visited?
[08:32:52] <vdclouis> that's a css, and it's not the same
[08:34:14] <vdclouis> update: http://jsfiddle.net/xG4Wz/2/
[08:34:33] <vdclouis> as you can see, the clicked links get the active class, but it doesn't navigate to google.com
[08:35:42] <deltree_> built out a minimal test case file://area51x-server/x51/testcase.html
[08:35:46] <deltree_> ack
[08:35:51] <deltree_> *facepalm*
[08:35:57] <deltree_> area-51-x.com/testcase.html
[08:39:04] <khan> i have a job interview next week for a front-end Dev position what are some ways i can prepare?
[08:39:39] <deltree_> khan this guy's a genius http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html
[08:39:59] <khan> thanks will read
[08:40:16] <khan> should i expect a skills test?
[08:40:58] <deltree_> expect everything and nothing will be a surprise. My research has shown that most companies do 2 or 3 of the things on the list of recommendations he gives in that post
[08:41:32] <deltree_> a lot of dev companies now do whiteboard code tests
[08:43:06] <deltree_> basic stuff, like "reverse a string without using string.Reverse() or fizzbuzz http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/ http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html
[08:43:48] <khan> alright lol making me nervous
[08:44:16] <deltree_> some, like joelonsoftware up there, go to the extreme and ask for knowledge of pointers in whiteboard tests, but you'll be front end, so it's likely fizzbuzz will be the worst you'll see
[08:44:38] <khan> the thing is the though i understand JS/jQuery but im not amazing at it
[08:44:47] <khan> im almost at the point where i dont have to google stuff
[08:45:04] <deltree_> development is 90% google
[08:45:16] <deltree_> 5% coding, and 5% meetings
[08:45:33] <deltree_> I am a programmer for a living
[08:46:08] <khan> cool
[08:46:21] <khan> so do you do freelance or working for a company?
[08:46:28] <deltree_> I work for a company
[08:46:49] <deltree_> I'm still a "junior developer"
[08:47:20] <khan> what qualifies as a 'senior developer'?
[08:48:09] <deltree_> once you can debug your webfarm
[08:48:40] <deltree_> I have a server at home, but I don't understand the WebFarmFramework
[08:49:17] <deltree_> anyway, I still have a jquery question, trying to traverse from one table to another and remember which row I was on.  I have a minimal testcase at http://area-51-x.com/testcase.html
[08:49:34] <deltree_> not real experienced with jquery
[08:49:45] <khan> ill look at it
[08:49:48] <khan> but its not loading
[08:50:05] <deltree_> it's not loading?
[08:50:28] <khan> server not found / firefox cant find server
[08:50:42] <khan> is something up with ur host?
[08:50:48] <deltree_> not to my knowledge
[08:50:53] <deltree_> do .org
[08:51:40] <khan> k its working
[08:51:41] <deltree_> and, I'm my host, so no.  it's possible my dns server is misconfigured, but if that were the case, why would I be able to get there
[08:51:55] <deltree_> hmm, I'll go verify myd ns
[08:52:01] <khan> i got it work on .org
[08:52:05] <deltree_> great
[08:53:25] <khan> k so what are you trying to acomplish?
[08:55:52] <deltree_> gotta get from one row on one table to the same row on the other table and change the content
[09:01:04] <khan> ill be honest bro i have no idea
[09:01:34] <hillsgarage> Could someone tell me why  the content won't scroll upon clicking one of the links on the right? http://hillsgarage.net/wpdir/?page_id=21
[09:02:06] <hillsgarage> err links on the left.
[09:03:24] <deltree_> #item1 is for the name of the anchor element you're scrolling to
[09:03:46] <deltree_> <a name="item1">You'd jump to here</a>
[09:04:10] <deltree_> and your content looks wonky in Chrome
[09:04:26] <khan> yeah keeps breaking on ff for me
[09:04:48] <khan> i have to refresh to get ur desired layout
[09:05:47] <deltree_> looks like you're having a nightmare setting up wordpress over there
[09:05:52] <deltree_> anyway
[09:05:53] <hillsgarage> LOL
[09:06:08] <hillsgarage> sighs I've been working through lots of issues.
[09:07:56] <khan> btw you might wanna fix the way you displayed those links
[09:08:01] <khan> i thought it was just plain text
[09:09:43] <deltree_> I think you're in over your head
[09:10:05] <deltree_> look, does anyone know how to do this traversal in jquery?
[09:12:08] <deltree_> fine, then a different question, if I get an element by doing $('div[id^="text"]) that is named text1 is there a way for me to get the 1 part of the element id?
[09:13:06] <hillsgarage> yea I agree, this was a last minute decision from the partners. I found the exact effect I wanted here http://www.queness.com/post/356/create-a-vertical-horizontal-and-diagonal-sliding-content-website-with-jquery
[09:13:47] <hillsgarage> that's what I used as a guide.
[09:16:27] <deltree_> and you still need an anchor element wieh a name attribute for it to work
[09:18:47] <lorentso> hey, is there a way to make draggable() stop propagation of events? i tried using stopPropagation() in its event handlers
[09:19:06] <hillsgarage> deltree_, thank you for your help.
[09:19:25] <lorentso> i get mousedown/mousemove/mouseup in document, which i don't want to if i'm dragging something
[09:19:31] <hillsgarage> forgetting the name anchor was it.
[09:19:38] <hillsgarage> *smacks head*
[09:20:16] <hillsgarage> khan, my partners mentioned that to me as well. Is it me or do underlined links look ugly?
[09:20:19] <deltree_> there, updated my minimal testcase for the new question.  I have the "This" as the id of one element and the id of the other is "findThis" how can I get from "findThis" to "This" when identifying "findThis" by td[id^="find"]
[09:22:43] <systemfault> You'll need to to explain better.... because it doesn't mean anything at all.
[09:23:00] <deltree_> who?
[09:24:52] <systemfault> deltree_: You.
[09:26:29] <VarunA> jquery
[09:26:30] <deltree_> I'm trying to traverse from "findThis" to "This" and I can either a) find a way to identify which row I'm on so I can select that row in the other table, or b) get the "This" portion of the "findThis" id and select the other element by that given that I'm using div[id^="find"] to identify the "findThis" element
[09:28:45] <khan> hillgarage i would say put more spacing and underline
[09:30:05] <hillsgarage> khan, thank you very much! That's a great Idea.
[09:30:25] <fris> whats the difference between return false; and e.preventDefault();
[09:30:28] <khan> hillsgarage also on the active link i would use a background that would stand out more
[09:30:57] <khan> and make it full width
[09:31:31] <hillsgarage> khan, Like a gray?
[09:32:01] <systemfault> fris: return false is pretty much preventDefault() + stopPropagation() AFAIK
[09:32:15] <deltree_> systemfault: the testcase is at http://area-51-x.com/testcase.html
[09:32:59] <khan> hillsgarage i would say make it a darkgrey with a white text
[09:33:13] <systemfault> fris: I personally don't use return false because of the greater flexibility of event.preventDefault()/.stopPropagation()
[09:34:47] <khan> hillsgarage also make the content width a little bigger because i can see the next item
[09:35:23] <systemfault> deltree_: That's clearer for me now, and you didn't get it to work or you're asking for a "better" way to do it?
[09:35:45] <deltree_> I think I could do $("div[id^='find']").attr('id').substring(after find....
[09:35:59] <deltree_> I guess that'd give me the "This" stuff
[09:36:17] <deltree_> but no, systemfault I haven't been able to get it to work
[09:37:04] <systemfault> deltree_: I think that using your a) solution is bad because it would make your code easy to break if the requirements ever change
[09:37:11] <systemfault> Ok... give me 2 minutes
[09:45:36] <systemfault> deltree_: http://jsfiddle.net/WLKLW/
[09:45:46] <systemfault> Sorry.. has the gf on the phone..
[09:45:49] <systemfault> *had
[09:46:12] <deltree_> that is gorgeous code
[09:46:14] <deltree_> thanks much
[09:46:20] <systemfault> yw :)
[09:54:12] <surfdue> is there smart autoloading like in php auto load classes for example for jquery/javascript? or do I have to manually load each module I make (included on the same file) with Module._instance = new Module();
[10:09:11] <deltree_> how do I do element.element to grab a child element in jquery?
[10:10:35] <systemfault> .find(selector)
[10:10:47] <systemfault> Or.. $(selector, from`)
[10:10:48] <deltree_> thanks
[10:10:52] <systemfault> -`
[10:32:12] <umren> guys should jquery load before or after modernizr ?
[10:32:26] <umren> can they conflict somehow
[10:32:41] <umren> or it's doesnt matter
[10:33:11] <systemfault> Doesn't matter afaik, they're unrelated.
[10:34:00] <systemfault> But _I_ personally load modernizr in the <head> just before my stylesheets to enable html5 elements on older IEs and I put all my scripts just before the </body>
[10:34:18] <Fox`> does anyone know of a plugin to simulate gravity? something similar to google's where the elements interact with one another http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google_gravity/
[10:34:34] <umren> systemfault: thx for pro tip
[10:54:16] <surfdue> Im having a brain fart here, I have a object called user with variables.. I tried accessing them  like this user.loggedIn user['loggedIn'] no luck.. but if I do a console.log on user heres what it shows: http://d.pr/MXtk
[10:56:38] <Eviltwin> Fine, I'll take a look
[10:57:15] <Eviltwin> Try doing a console.log(JSON.stringify(user['loggedIn']))
[10:57:25] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[10:57:33] <Eviltwin> console.log(JSON.stringify(user))
[10:57:42] <Eviltwin> Or console.log($.extend({},user))
[10:57:52] <Eviltwin> One of the things the console does that seems pretty cool at first
[10:57:57] <Eviltwin> Is it live updates the objects
[10:58:09] <Eviltwin> So console.log(user); user.foobar = "barfoo";
[10:58:20] <surfdue> let me try
[10:58:20] <Eviltwin> In your console, you will see foobar: "barfoo"
[10:58:35] <surfdue> for soem reason i cant interact with my variables in chrome atleast
[10:58:36] <Eviltwin> So the first one spits it out as serialized JSON (obviously doesn't update with the object)
[10:58:42] <surfdue> it says they dont exist :O
[10:58:43] <Eviltwin> The second makes a shallow copy of the object
[10:59:05] <Eviltwin> If your keys aren't there, it means they're added after you're accessing them
[10:59:12] <Eviltwin> Probably due to a race condition with AJAX or something
[10:59:12] <surfdue> Eviltwin: im pretty happy with what ive done so far u should see
[11:00:02] <Eviltwin> I think I should be wrapping presents and not getting distracted here :P
[11:00:36] <surfdue> Eviltwin: quite strange.. none of those worked atleast from what i could tell I actually have a pretty decent debug function
[11:01:45] <surfdue> Eviltwin: ya tahts all I got.. this has neverr occured where I can clearly see the object but its like it dosnt exist lol http://d.pr/lRxT
[11:02:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/PRLKs/
[11:05:01] <surfdue> Eviltwin: the first function returns the object, as expected still not accesible but the second one destroys it :P http://d.pr/MakK
[11:05:47] <Eviltwin> Destroys it?
[11:05:59] <surfdue> ya i mean its empty
[11:06:14] <Eviltwin> What's the code that's making this object?
[11:06:27] <surfdue> i know this makes sense, but I hate how js does it... i have my main functions up top above the "modules" and I cant access my global config variable when I set the user in the init on the user module from above.
[11:06:30] <surfdue> i ahte that :P
[11:07:11] <surfdue> Eviltwin: dude im really really legally high right now.. ive never been like this, for the past day im on new medication to help me concentrate at work.. well i dont know what it feels like to be high, but i expect this is it
[11:07:19] <surfdue> sorry if I have been annoying the past few days, today, etc.
[11:10:08] <surfdue> Eviltwin: the way I am generating this object is fairly complex. In the init of the users module I am pulling from my backend php which generates a response in json. I grab that json with .ajax datatype json, then I .each the response object and set Site.user.KEY = VAL; In my user signin function I just pass the variable to the external page load function I just pass the Site.user object
[11:10:27] <Eviltwin> So you're doing something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/BQuKp/
[11:11:09] <surfdue> Eviltwin: basically I am setting it with user[KEY] = VAL and user = {} before hand
[11:12:01] <Eviltwin> Is it kind of like that jsFiddle I linked just now?
[11:12:38] <surfdue> i think its odd how chrome list practically everything as an object its hard to see what it really is, and yes its very similar just more spread out
[11:12:53] <Eviltwin> It used to be different
[11:13:05] <Eviltwin> DOM elements were shown as a rough serialization of their open tag
[11:13:08] <Eviltwin> That you could expand
[11:13:14] <surfdue> reguardless we can clearly see the object.. its strange ive never not been able to access it I wonder if I can convert it to an array
[11:13:42] * surfdue pnders
[11:13:48] <Eviltwin> surfdue: So are you doing something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/BQuKp/
[11:14:07] <surfdue> Eviltwin: its the same as you showed me before right?
[11:14:26] <Eviltwin> This one has AJAX
[11:14:49] <surfdue> oh yes except that im doing the data abit different
[11:14:56] <surfdue> well that dosnt matter
[11:15:02] <surfdue> but my datatype is json
[11:15:11] <Eviltwin> Do you remember why AJAX calls have a success function?
[11:15:21] <surfdue> yes i use it
[11:16:11] <Eviltwin> Do you know that it's impossible to do var result = ajaxDataFetchFunction(params); if its using async AJAX?
[11:16:37] <Eviltwin> You need to use callbacks if you're using AJAX
[11:16:41] <surfdue> im not using async ajax tohugh i dont think?
[11:16:51] <surfdue> let me show you my ajax call
[11:16:56] <Eviltwin> It defaults to async and you should never use sync, it's a hack
[11:18:08] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/BQuKp/1/
[11:18:19] <Eviltwin> That'll never work quite the way you want it to
[11:18:22] <Eviltwin> No matter how hard you try
[11:19:22] <Eviltwin> And it's because of JavaScript's single-threadedness
[11:19:37] <Eviltwin> The success callback doesn't actually run until after the console.log calls in that situation
[11:19:46] <Eviltwin> Here it is with order of execution labeled: http://jsfiddle.net/BQuKp/2/
[11:20:57] <surfdue> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/q4VvK/
[11:22:38] <surfdue> Eviltwin: the top two objects are the dumps from my debug functions
[11:23:02] <Eviltwin> From the Site.debug(output, 'getResponse - Output');?
[11:23:14] <surfdue> i could probably wrap everything and time it properly with a loading screen to make it load in the proper order but yuck lol
[11:23:29] <surfdue> Eviltwin: there is two one is the second is from that the first is from the input one
[11:23:39] <Eviltwin> I suggest you throw a breakpoint in this function
[11:23:41] <Eviltwin> And step through it
[11:23:42] <surfdue> basically right before we send it via ajax, and right as we recieve it back
[11:23:49] <Eviltwin> And make sure everything's happening in the order you think it is
[11:23:51] <surfdue> Eviltwin: why ? it works fine :/
[11:24:01] <Eviltwin> I thought you said it didn't?
[11:24:04] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i mean im usign the function on other things
[11:24:07] <surfdue> Nooo
[11:24:09] <Eviltwin> You weren't able to find keys in the output or something
[11:24:13] <surfdue> I just cant access this ONE object :P
[11:24:32] <surfdue> this is the functionI use to load all request
[11:24:42] <Eviltwin> Well breakpoint + stepping is still the best way to track when an object gets modified
[11:24:44] <surfdue> except pages.. that is just a .load :P
[11:24:55] <Eviltwin> Add a Watch Expression for the object
[11:25:05] <surfdue> ill just get c++ to screenshot the chrome dev bar and decode it so i can pass it to the users.. :P
[11:25:11] <surfdue> jk lol wow.. :P
[11:25:32] <surfdue> i think it has to do with our original issues of this instance model.
[11:25:47] <surfdue> if im loading the request inside this instance it could be restricted to only members of the isntance correct?
[11:26:09] <surfdue> even though I can "read" it maybe the objects are locked or something iuno
[11:40:45] <denysonique> How do I display ['foo','bar'] JS Array object as a "['foo','bar']" string?
[11:41:11] <surfdue> omg my cats eyes are glowing orange :O
[11:43:01] <denysonique> I want to do something like $('textarea').val(['foo','bar'])
[11:44:04] <surfdue> denysonique: well I know you can do a $.each([array], function(k,v){  }) and set it as a string ? :)
[11:44:13] <surfdue> I dont know if thats the best way, im sure ti isnt :P
[11:44:13] <denysonique> surfdue: hehe lol
[11:44:17] <denysonique> well
[11:44:19] <denysonique> hmm
[11:44:30] <surfdue> denysonique: check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5289403/jquery-convert-javascript-array-to-string
[11:45:01] <surfdue> denysonique: somebody dosnt google.. :P
[11:45:17] <denysonique> surfdue: well
[11:45:28] <denysonique> I didn't find the right answers!
[11:45:58] <denysonique> btw
[11:46:07] <denysonique> I prefer $([1,2,3]).each()
[11:46:15] <denysonique> than $.each(array, ...)
[11:46:41] <surfdue> thats not the right way to do it
[11:46:45] <surfdue> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
[11:46:48] <surfdue> lol :P
[11:47:16] <surfdue> just because you could use a dead animal carcus to brush your hair, dosnt mean you should... (i have seen this first hand)
[11:48:59] <denysonique> ok
[11:49:16] <denysonique> this is the right way!
[11:49:18] <denysonique> "['" + [1,2,3].join("','") + "']"
[11:49:22] <denysonique> and most efficient
[11:49:32] <surfdue> ew
[11:49:32] <denysonique> with CoffeeScript it is going to be even more beatiful
[11:49:49] <surfdue> i never understood why people use different languages to code languages
[11:49:56] <denysonique> well
[11:50:08] <denysonique> it makes you way more efficient
[11:50:15] <surfdue> thats like me speaking russian to to a english translater who speaks back with me in russian.. Why not just speak russian?
[11:50:26] <surfdue> denysonique: just be more efficient yourself :)
[11:50:35] <denysonique> you probably are a PHP person
[11:50:41] <surfdue> I gave you the honor of googling it, and im still not amused.
[11:50:48] <surfdue> HOW DID YOU GUESS? I am in the #php chan ;)
[11:51:17] <surfdue> can you convert your js to this "coffee" machine
[11:51:24] <denysonique> learn some Ruby/Rails and Python
[11:51:33] <denysonique> it will totally change your way of thinking
[11:51:43] <surfdue> im not completely against switching it up, I use mongodb now instead of mysuckL
[11:52:01] <surfdue> nah I would rather stick with langauges that dont care if my word is off by one space :P
[11:52:12] <denysonique> then Ruby
[11:53:59] <surfdue> uh
[11:54:04] <surfdue> ill trade you?
[11:54:11] <surfdue> you teach me ruby and ill teach you the force.
[11:57:56] <windsurf_> my wordpress theme has jquery ui in it. How can I leverage the existing .css to display my fields as larger with rounded corners â€“ is this a javascript call or some predefined classes I should apply to my form elements?

[13:00:34] <v0lZy> hello everyone
[13:00:38] <v0lZy> merry christmas
[13:00:48] <nexus74> Merry Christmas
[13:01:11] <v0lZy> I have a jquery wish! :D
[13:02:00] <nexus74> what is the wish?
[13:03:35] <nexus74> If anyone can help: This works: http://jsfiddle.net/SL8vx/9/  This doesn't: http://jsfiddle.net/SL8vx/10/  any ideas why??
[13:03:36] <nexus74> With the second link, the menu text and button will not move with the div.
[13:03:36] <nexus74> The only thing i changed between the two was the fourth line of my css jfiddle window
[13:05:20] <v0lZy> u want it to move together downwards?
[13:05:35] <v0lZy> items i mean?
[13:06:01] <nexus74> v0lZy: yes,
[13:06:02] <kkuno> hi :)
[13:06:08] <kkuno> and merry christmas :|
[13:06:16] <kkuno> I need an advice
[13:06:54] <kkuno> I want to hide a div using .hide()... and then show some specific subdivs
[13:06:55] <nexus74> v0lZy: It needs to work like this one: http://jsfiddle.net/SL8vx/9/ only i want it at the top of the screen and animate down
[13:07:27] <kkuno> how can I do this? if I .show() the div everything will be shown...
[13:08:44] <pulse00> kkuno: i think you need to manually hide/show each subdiv and keep the parent div visible
[13:09:12] <kkuno> mmh this is nasty
[13:09:26] <pulse00> is there a way to get the .live() / .delegate() methods to work with the load event?
[13:09:28] <v0lZy> nexus: i think its because u are animating height
[13:09:44] <v0lZy> by default, alignment is top and left
[13:10:01] <kkuno> because I need to hide what I don't want instead of show what I want which would be easier
[13:10:02] <v0lZy> when u just increase he size of #navigation, you are not altering anything
[13:10:12] <nexus74> v0lZy: I was thinking it had something to do with that
[13:10:25] <kkuno> hide what I don't want and then show the main div
[13:10:31] <v0lZy> what you need to do is absolutely position the items to the bottom
[13:10:39] <v0lZy> of f the #navigation div
[13:10:49] <v0lZy> then they will move downwards once u expand the #navigation div
[13:11:28] <nexus74> v0lZy: well im changing the height of #footerSlideContent...
[13:11:33] <nexus74> not #navigation
[13:11:37] <v0lZy> kkuno: maybe instead of hiding the parent dive, create a function to hide a group of subdivs...
[13:12:49] <v0lZy> http://jsfiddle.net/SL8vx/13/
[13:12:54] <kkuno> yeah but I don't want to show divs then hide them, it would be awful, I need to hide the main div, do all operations in background and then show the final result
[13:12:57] <v0lZy> basically just position absolutely to the bottom nexus.
[13:13:10] <v0lZy> on the #navigation .. i added position: absolute; bottom: 50px;
[13:13:12] <nexus74> v0lZy: you rock!  thank you
[13:13:43] <kkuno> which is pretty complicated because I'm using lot of ajax code to load content and other things
[13:13:58] <pulse00> kkuno: wyh don't you simply hide all child divs and then show the ones you need visible?
[13:14:14] <kkuno> mhhh
[13:14:28] <v0lZy> i think kkuno has everything hidden when it loads, or wants to have it hidden
[13:14:39] <v0lZy> then, selectively, from the group of hidden things, show certain things, right?
[13:14:50] <kkuno> I want everything hidden and then manually show some divs
[13:14:57] <kkuno> yeah pulse00's solution might work
[13:15:09] <v0lZy> ?
[13:15:15] <v0lZy> how does his work and mine doesnt when its the same thing :D
[13:15:34] <v0lZy> v0lZy	kkuno: maybe instead of hiding the parent dive, create a function to hide a group of subdivs...
[13:15:39] <kkuno> ohh
[13:15:40] <v0lZy> pulse00	kkuno: wyh don't you simply hide all child divs and then show the ones you need visible?
[13:15:43] <kkuno> yeah
[13:15:52] <v0lZy> u can do it even easier
[13:15:54] <v0lZy> create a class
[13:16:09] <v0lZy> 'showElement'
[13:16:13] <kkuno> so something like    $(parent_div).each(function(){   $(this).hide()   })
[13:16:23] <v0lZy> hide all childs that dont have the 'showElement' class
[13:16:28] <v0lZy> and show those that do.
[13:16:51] <v0lZy> or the other way around
[13:17:00] <v0lZy> hide all divs that have a 'hideElement' class.
[13:17:11] <v0lZy> by default, give it to every element you want hidden at the beginning
[13:17:16] <v0lZy> then just remove upon selection
[13:17:46] <kkuno> yeah
[13:17:49] <v0lZy> nexus74: I have a differnet problem myself, I was wondering if anyone can help me resolve
[13:17:53] <kkuno> i'll try
[13:17:54] <kkuno> thanks
[13:18:15] <nexus74> v0lZy: sure
[13:18:33] <v0lZy> I've never done liquid layouts before
[13:19:07] <v0lZy> but what I have is kind of like... within an element that has dynamic width (it has no width defined, just left position and right position)
[13:19:20] <v0lZy> inside this element, i need 3 columns
[13:19:30] <v0lZy> but when the element is  300px or less
[13:19:57] <v0lZy> I want all the text in 1 column
[13:20:18] <v0lZy> basically.. if there is space, elements are horizontal.. as the space (width) is reduced, they stack one under the other
[13:20:31] <v0lZy> im having some difficulty doing that.
[13:20:39] <nexus74> v0lZy: so you want your CSS layout to change based on the condition of a div
[13:20:59] <spiffie> is the container resizeable?
[13:21:10] <v0lZy> its resizable to a point
[13:21:29] <v0lZy> (indefinetly towards increasing, but only up to 300px when decreasing size)
[13:21:53] <fris> whats the difference between return false; and e.preventDefault() when using a hash example <a href="#">
[13:22:01] <spiffie> by the user, or it just has a max-width set?
[13:22:07] <spiffie> er, min-width
[13:24:03] <v0lZy> min width
[13:24:20] <spiffie> ok
[13:24:27] <v0lZy> but its kind of like
[13:24:36] <v0lZy> this is all inside an absolutely position div
[13:24:56] <spiffie> so basically if the container is wider than 900px, you want the immediate children to be three columns, but otherwise you want them stacked?
[13:25:33] <crankharder> I have a table w/ a bunch of inputs.  on $('table input').change(){...})  How can I get all of the *other* inputs, not including the one that changed
[13:25:46] <v0lZy> inside an absolutely position div, I have a relatively position subdiv. Inside this subdiv, which is arbitrarily wide, but never less than 300px, I need sections of 300px a peace to go horizontally one after another if there is space.. if ther eis not, drop one under another.
[13:25:57] <v0lZy> spiffie: yeah exactly
[13:26:02] <v0lZy> if its 600px, thats 2 columns
[13:26:07] <v0lZy> if its 900px thats 3 columns
[13:26:14] <v0lZy> of ots 300px.. just 1 column
[13:26:25] <v0lZy> now i dont know what the problem is with what im doing
[13:26:38] <pulse00> how do you guys call jquery plugins on elements loaded via ajax? .live() and .delegate() would be good candidates, but the load event is not bubbled it seems, so $('body').delegate('.myThing', 'load', function() { $(this).myPlugin() } ) won't work
[13:27:01] <v0lZy> or.. hm, hold on
[13:27:04] <v0lZy> let me just check something
[13:27:40] <pulse00> crankharder: var that = $(this); $(this).parent().children().each( function () { if ($(this) != $(that)) { ... }; }); <--- something like this i suppose
[13:27:41] <spiffie> hm, well if it were me I'd probably handle it through CSS media queries instead of JavaScript. figure out what the viewport size is that allows your container to be 900, 600, and 300px and then set your media query statements appropriately.
[13:28:01] <v0lZy> ah, i think i got it.. position relative
[13:28:55] <nexus74> v0lZy: sorry i couldn't be more help to you, thank you for helping me out
[13:29:33] <v0lZy> no problem nexus74
[13:30:05] <v0lZy> spiffie: i think i got the hang of it with css now
[13:30:09] <v0lZy> but i have a different ... problem
[13:30:16] <v0lZy> and this one is more jquery related
[13:30:32] <v0lZy> im basically using animate height to hide/unhide some overflown text
[13:30:54] <v0lZy> but im also using width: 100% on the parent div
[13:31:03] <v0lZy> I think i heard somewhere about using a .toggle() function
[13:31:11] <v0lZy> that supposabely shows just the amoun I need?
[13:31:34] <spiffie> I think the load even is only going to fire at page load. for your ajax responses you probably want to pass that set of elements to your plugin in the success callback.
[13:32:27] <v0lZy> hm.. this is gonna be difficult to explain
[13:32:54] <v0lZy> not even sure if this is possible
[13:33:42] <crankharder> pulse00: problem is that while this/that might reference the same element, they're not the same object.  so $(this) != $(that) is always true.
[13:34:02] <v0lZy> ok, heres the thing: I have several 'relatively' positioned elements inside of which I have text. Each of this elements is resizable in height and width
[13:34:55] <v0lZy> each however has a fixed starting height. and once i click a button, the height increases.... now what i need it ..argh
[13:34:59] <v0lZy> teamviewer?
[13:35:16] <pulse00> crankharder: what about the target of the event? maybe that'll work. it was just a guess, i never needed to do that
[13:40:00] <com4> Why won't this dialog open when the page loads? http://pastebin.com/N0paVn1P
[13:40:03] <v0lZy> huh, i think i pinned it down: I need to resize an element based on the height of the text inside it
[13:41:26] <v0lZy> I have no idea how to do this with jquery
[13:41:56] <v0lZy> animate height to whatever  is needed in order to fit all the text in 300px width
[13:41:59] <v0lZy> help!
[13:42:51] <pulse00> com4: i guess you need to append the div to the dom at some point.
[13:43:09] <com4> i guess that might make sense.
[13:43:33] <pulse00> how can i add a css class to elements loaded via ajax? http://jsfiddle.net/GujqL/1/ trying 3 methods, none works
[13:45:16] <com4> pulse00: I tossed the div in the page just for fun and that made no difference :(
[13:45:47] <pulse00> and you referenced the div by id when calling .dialog() ?
[13:46:19] <com4> yep
[13:46:37] <v0lZy> spiffie: any idea how to animate a css height property based on whatever amount of height it needs to fit all the text?
[13:47:02] <systemfault> pulse00: That code doesn't make any sense...
[13:47:09] <com4> pulse00: http://pastebin.com/9YWNVHu4
[13:47:45] <pulse00> systemfault: why?
[13:47:56] <systemfault> Because it doesn't work that way..
[13:48:19] <systemfault> Adding a node to a container doesn't trigger a load event afaik.
[13:48:48] <systemfault> Add the class yourself in the "completion" callback of your ajax call
[13:49:02] <systemfault> completion meaning.. success I guess..
[13:49:03] <pulse00> systemfault: i don't have access to that callback
[13:49:30] <systemfault> Then how do you load the content in the page then?
[13:50:10] <pulse00> it's some javascript implemented by a php framework. i just need to call .chosen() on any element loaded via ajax by that framework
[13:50:39] <pulse00> i know it works with the liveQuery plugin, but i'm looking for a way to do this with "native" jquery
[13:50:53] <spiffie> v0lZy: I would put p elements inside your container divs, then iterate over the p elements and use .height() to get their heights, total them up, and apply the total height to the container.
[13:51:28] <v0lZy> hm
[13:51:31] <pulse00> com4: the code looks fine imo. i suppose you don't get any errors
[13:51:35] <v0lZy> that might work
[13:51:38] <v0lZy> but .. hm..
[13:52:32] <systemfault> pulse00: Not sure how even liveQuery could work..
[13:53:15] <zulax> getScript, does it have any access restriction, like can't go up 2 directories?
[13:53:18] <pulse00> systemfault: with livequery it's simply $('.myElement').liveQuery(function() { $(this).addClass('red'); }) ;
[13:54:00] <systemfault> I'd be really surprised if it worked.
[13:54:18] <systemfault> Or livequery does some kind of weird black magic.
[13:54:52] <burdickjp> I'd like to change the class of an <a> element which has an href equal to the current document, any suggestions?
[13:58:06] <SrPx> hey guys how do I select a div inside another? like $(this,".myClass") to select myClass inside this
[13:58:35] <zulax> $.getScript('../../folder/myjs.js',function(data,textStatus){}
[13:58:37] <systemfault> SrPx: Reverse the order and you got it.
[13:58:59] <zulax> would that not work?i cant see any result
[13:59:03] <systemfault> SrPx: You can also use .find
[13:59:23] <zulax> but './folder/myjs.js' seems to work
[14:00:29] <SrPx> systemfault: what? $(".myClass',this) will work? O.o
[14:01:20] <systemfault> ...It's simple: $(selector, parentNode) or parentNode.find(selector);
[14:01:26] <SrPx> great
[14:01:34] <SrPx> thank you. i was just guessing
[14:02:12] <pulse00> systemfault: https://gist.github.com/1518439 <-- this works
[14:02:30] <zulax> the info on jq page doesnt say any limitation of getScript so I am guess i should be able to do ../../folder/file.js
[14:04:01] <zulax> but i cant get it to work
[14:05:51] <systemfault> Ewww livequery.
[14:05:58] <systemfault> People really use that^
[14:05:59] <systemfault> ?
[14:07:01] <zulax> or do i need to escape for ../../ ?
[14:07:29] <systemfault> pulse00: You won't be able to do it without liveQuery..
[14:07:39] <systemfault> pulse00: Because liveQuery polls the DOM for changes.
[14:08:02] <pulse00> systemfault: ah, i see. thanks a lot.
[14:10:21] <zulax> tried disable web security on chrome, still dont get it
[14:23:18] <CORALZX> Anyone on this day?
[14:26:33] <arek_deepinit> CORALZX: on what day?
[14:27:59] <zulax> what about this day?
[14:30:32] <arek_deepinit> zulax: i guess he meant some misterious DA THIS day ;)
[14:31:29] <zulax> he could be talking in between 2 channels and got confused
[14:31:32] <SrPx> hey people, jQuery(".content",this).toggle();  <- this will toggle every .content class inside this. how do I change it to toggle only classes that are directly this's children?
[14:34:11] <juha_> http://userpics.com/I_will_never_look_at_a_power_outlet_the_same_again.jpg :D
[14:35:22] <SrPx> nobody? ;s
[14:35:50] <SrPx> also, how do I do this? jQuery(selector).do(callback) // what to put instead of 'do'?
[14:45:47] <Eviltwin> SrPx: ?
[14:46:41] <Eviltwin> SrPx: Callbacks fire as the result of something
[14:46:50] <Eviltwin> What's the something you want to fire on?
[15:04:00] <SrPx> Eviltwin: i mean I want to select a class and do somethinig with it
[15:04:31] <Eviltwin> Do......what?
[15:04:51] <Eviltwin> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[15:04:54] <Eviltwin> Read that
[15:05:40] <SrPx> ok i will
[15:06:07] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: i think that should be everyones start point
[15:06:18] <SrPx> Eviltwin: jQuery(".content",this).toggle() <- how do I limit this to direct children, not children of children?
[15:06:27] <Eviltwin> arek_deepinit: I never read it but I could probably write it
[15:07:00] <Eviltwin> This should actually be everyone's start point: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[15:07:06] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: well, everyone has to read it at some point:), unless You are core developer
[15:07:16] <arek_deepinit> and been there all that time from the start
[15:07:35] <Eviltwin> Too many people learn jQuery before really understanding the advanced parts of JavaScript
[15:07:47] <Eviltwin> And as a result, they try to use the tools provided by jQuery for everything
[15:07:53] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[15:07:53] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:07:56] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin:  id say 1% does understand adv JS
[15:08:29] <Eviltwin> The "jQuery way" to do things that JavaScript already makes easy is the JavaScript way
[15:08:33] <Eviltwin> And those aren't in the jQuery docs
[15:08:36] <Eviltwin> Because they're JavaSCript
[15:09:02] <arek_deepinit> well, i think i got what You mean
[15:09:28] <Eviltwin> "How do I run this code after 5 seconds in jQuery?"
[15:09:33] <arek_deepinit> dom manipulation and stuff
[15:09:53] <Eviltwin> While JavaScript can do DOM manipulation, it's much more verbose
[15:10:12] <arek_deepinit> that is basically the point
[15:10:17] <Eviltwin> Yup
[15:10:19] <arek_deepinit> and selector engine
[15:10:28] <SrPx> Eviltwin: you dont know how to do this? :/
[15:10:28] <arek_deepinit> event binding
[15:10:31] <Eviltwin> Again, selectors don't do anything you couldn't do already
[15:10:40] <Eviltwin> Same with event binding
[15:10:54] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: obviously i know
[15:11:00] <arek_deepinit> <prays for IE to die>
[15:11:01] <Eviltwin> SrPx: You haven't said what "this" is
[15:11:38] <SrPx> jQuery("selector",this).toggle() //this will toggle every children of this, including children of children of this. how do I limit this to direct children of this?
[15:11:42] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: but still i consider JQ pretty good job
[15:12:26] <arek_deepinit> SrPx: read about css3 selectors
[15:13:15] <Eviltwin> SrPx: If you toggle the children (make them display: none), everything below them is invisible too
[15:13:19] <Eviltwin> That's kind of how it works
[15:13:23] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/xUWUwDBN
[15:13:33] <Eviltwin> That's why there's jQUery functionality for that
[15:13:45] <Eviltwin> It takes a complicated thing in JavaSctipt and makes it a lot easier
[15:14:00] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: hardly
[15:14:09] <arek_deepinit> as long people got idea of namespaces ;)
[15:14:25] <arek_deepinit> but most dont have idea about pretty much anything, and that is really sad
[15:15:29] <arek_deepinit> i mean with an array and split() You can do really incredible things
[15:16:08] <Eviltwin> When I talk about jQuery and JavaScript and their strengths, I generally leave out the things that are common features of most languages
[15:16:14] <Eviltwin> Such as split/join etc and regexes
[15:16:22] <SrPx> Eviltwin: sorry, i was asking the wrong thing (facepalms) . what I was trying to do is impossible. well, ill try another design. how can I get the next HTML element in relation to an element? for instance: jQuery(".myClass").click(function() { this.next().toggle() }) // <- this would toggle the next element starting from 'this'
[15:17:41] <Eviltwin> SrPx: $(".myClass") makes what's basically an array (plus the extra magic jQuery functions) of all of the elemnts that match that selector
[15:17:54] <SrPx> yep
[15:18:02] <Eviltwin> The "this" actually refers to the element clicked
[15:18:07] <SrPx> yep
[15:18:11] <Eviltwin> Not one of these jQuery array/object things
[15:18:18] <SrPx> then I want the next element on the html document main order.
[15:18:18] <Eviltwin> So you can't do the jQuery stuff to it directly
[15:18:21] <SrPx> can I get it?
[15:18:25] <Eviltwin> But you can make a jQuery object out of it
[15:18:28] <Eviltwin> $(element)
[15:18:30] <Eviltwin> In this case $(this)
[15:18:35] <Eviltwin> Then you can do jQuery stuff to that
[15:19:16] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[15:20:10] <SrPx> sure but that i know. I just want the next HTML element in relation to a given jQuery object. for instance. on the html document I have <div id="a1"></div><div id="a2"></div> . Can i get #a2 after selecting #a1?
[15:20:42] <Eviltwin> var foo = $("#a1").next()
[15:20:44] <arek_deepinit> $("#id").next();
[15:20:48] <SrPx> thanks (=
[15:20:49] <arek_deepinit> sorry:D
[15:20:49] <Eviltwin> foo is now a collection with one element
[15:20:51] <SrPx> lol
[15:20:57] <Eviltwin> The one with ID a2
[15:21:04] <SrPx> this was just what I guessed. if I had just tested before asking. ><
[15:21:15] <Eviltwin> SrPx: see ?.next
[15:21:16] <bot-t> SrPx, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:21:33] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com is incredibly thorough documentation for every method of jQuery
[15:21:38] <Eviltwin> If you're not sure what something does, always go there first
[15:21:54] <SrPx> hm! OK
[15:21:56] <Eviltwin> It features a detailed description of the syntaxes and what they mean
[15:22:04] <Eviltwin> And usually several example uses
[15:22:16] <SrPx> I will, thankyou
[15:23:35] <arek_deepinit> SrPx: but usually You want build proper structure of Your document, so You can acess it simply by #id
[15:24:37] <Eviltwin> I don't know if those were actual IDs
[15:25:04] <Eviltwin> It's a good practice to get to siblings by the .next and .prev selectors if your document is laid out that way
[15:25:21] <Eviltwin> methods*
[15:25:28] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: You mean collections iteration ?
[15:25:31] <Eviltwin> Rather than selecting unnecessarily
[15:25:43] <SrPx> jQuery(".test").click(function() { this.next().toggle(); }); //this wont work :/ this.next undefined
[15:25:51] <Eviltwin> SrPx: I told you how to fix that
[15:26:08] <SrPx> wait.
[15:26:09] <SrPx> sorry
[15:26:10] <SrPx> sure
[15:26:10] <Eviltwin> "this" is a DOM element, not a jQuery object
[15:26:26] <Eviltwin> You need to make it a jQuery object to call jQuery methods on it
[15:26:36] <SrPx> yes, sure. sorry. working now (=
[15:29:27] <arek_deepinit> I remember that from some talk -->Collections in the HTML DOM are assumed to be live meaning that they are automatically updated when the underlying document is changed.
[15:29:39] <arek_deepinit> that is why i dont think they are such good idea
[15:29:51] <Eviltwin> NodeLists are live
[15:30:03] <Eviltwin> They represent right now exactly what things match
[15:30:29] <Eviltwin> Which made things very confusing when I was trying to loop over all the scripts and remove them
[15:30:42] <Eviltwin> It was skipping every other one as a result
[15:31:05] <arek_deepinit> DOM is a failure
[15:31:13] <Eviltwin> On one hand, it could be a useful feature
[15:31:17] <Eviltwin> Having them update
[15:31:27] <Eviltwin> And its more efficient since it doesn't have to make a copy of it
[15:31:33] <arek_deepinit> but has grieve implications on perf
[15:31:33] <Eviltwin> If you want a copy, you make a copy
[15:31:46] <Eviltwin> Well it's not like it's actually updating every refrence
[15:31:51] <Eviltwin> The DOM tracks all that anyway
[15:31:57] <Eviltwin> You're just getting a reference to an existing data structure
[15:32:20] <arek_deepinit> Eviltwin: btw im working on embedded JS engine
[15:32:40] <arek_deepinit> its bit faster than Node:)

[16:21:25] <Kit-10> google is your friend there
[16:24:36] <SrPx> not really.

[16:25:54] <Kit-10> it's christmas day here.. not really got much muster to help .. sorry
[16:37:11] <E289> how can i save the state of the whole page including textboxes into a variable? i want to use .innerHTML or .html() but it doesn't store the values of some elements. is there a workaround?
[16:37:53] <Eviltwin> E289: You can't actually save all of the state
[16:38:16] <Eviltwin> Mostly because it's a really bad idea
[16:38:19] <Eviltwin> Really wasteful
[16:39:01] <zulax> is there a syntax checker for js/jquery ?
[16:39:01] <E289> well, here's what i want to do. i have a feedback system so that when user reports a bug, the content of the entire page is sent back to the server
[16:39:42] <E289> so that the problem can be easily traced. the .html() already works but the fields are using default values instead of values entered by the user
[16:41:00] <Eviltwin> zulax: jslint and jQuery Lint
[16:41:09] <zulax> cool,
[16:41:14] <Eviltwin> Also the Firebug and WebKit debugger
[16:41:24] <Eviltwin> jslint checks syntax
[16:41:33] <Eviltwin> For JavaScript
[16:41:37] <zulax> Eviltwin, i get error on the first line in a js page, does that mean somthing in the entire page is wrong? cause the first like is ok
[16:41:40] <Eviltwin> Makes sure everything is where it should be
[16:41:45] <Eviltwin> jQuery Lint is runtime
[16:41:55] <Eviltwin> As you're browsing the page, it reports back mistakes you've made
[16:42:10] <Eviltwin> zulax: It's probably the minified jQuery
[16:42:19] <Eviltwin> Well
[16:42:27] <Eviltwin> Are you using Firebug or the Developer Tools?
[16:42:35] <zulax> Firebug
[16:42:45] <zulax> it shows the error is always on first line of that page
[16:42:55] <Eviltwin> Of which file?
[16:42:58] <Eviltwin> It normally says file:#
[16:43:26] <Eviltwin> And is it a Syntax error?
[16:43:31] <Eviltwin> Or something else?
[16:43:42] <zulax> myfile.js? =1324773647320
[16:43:51] <Eviltwin> What kind of error?
[16:43:53] <zulax> and when i click on it, it highlights the first line
[16:44:07] <zulax> function main(right_ans_in){
[16:44:40] <Eviltwin> Have you paged through this? http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:44:54] <Eviltwin> And do you have a "</script>" somewhere in your actual JavaScript code?
[16:45:46] <zulax> its an external file
[16:46:01] <zulax> called by a script tag
[16:46:20] <Eviltwin> And what kind of error is it?
[16:46:25] <Eviltwin> It should have a name
[16:46:35] <Eviltwin> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide7
[16:46:41] <zulax> oh, syntax
[16:47:04] <Eviltwin> And does it say something like Unexpected token?
[16:48:09] <zulax> all firebug says is syntax error and gives the name of the function(which is the first line on the page)
[16:49:49] <Eviltwin> The call to it or the definition in the external file?
[16:50:06] <Eviltwin> Is it complaining about the page or the external file?
[16:50:18] <Eviltwin> Each JavaScript file is parsed and run separately
[16:50:48] <zulax> its complaining the external file, my_main.js
[16:50:58] <Eviltwin> Okay, can I see it perchance?
[16:51:06] <Eviltwin> Might spot something
[16:51:17] <Eviltwin> (No promises)
[16:51:50] <zulax> the files says like file.js?=xxxxxxxx , what does that number mean?
[16:52:27] <Eviltwin> Generally that's done to prevent it from using the browser cache
[16:52:56] <Eviltwin> I think it's generally called "cache busting"
[16:53:12] <zulax> ok, looks like my problem is bigger than that, :( i will need to be busy now
[16:53:18] <zulax> i will be back
[16:53:23] <Eviltwin> I might be later
[16:53:26] <Eviltwin> Dunno
[16:53:28] <Eviltwin> I drop in and out
[16:53:31] <E289> if i have <input type="button" onclick="$('input,textarea,button').attr('value',$(this).val());" /> how do i make $(this) access the input,textarea and button elements and not the current INPUT?
[16:54:03] <Eviltwin> E289: You really shouldn't use onclick=""
[16:54:06] <Eviltwin> Ever
[16:54:12] <Eviltwin> It's considered a bad practice
[16:54:12] <E289> okay please hold that thought
[16:54:17] <Eviltwin> see ?.on or see ?.bind
[16:54:18] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:54:19] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[16:54:25] <E289> but how about the $(this) ?
[16:54:35] <Eviltwin> You really shouldn't use onclick=""
[16:54:36] <Eviltwin> Ever
[16:54:39] <Eviltwin> It's a bad practice
[16:54:44] <Eviltwin> And that's part of your problem
[16:54:48] <Eviltwin> Your bad practice is biting you in the ass
[16:54:51] <E289> so that means all my onclick should be in a JS file?
[16:54:58] <E289> and always use .binds?
[16:55:10] <Eviltwin> You should separate presentation from script logic, yes
[16:55:24] <E289> ah, right
[16:55:26] <E289> thanks
[16:55:32] <Eviltwin> HTML is presentation
[16:55:35] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is logic
[16:55:39] <destryalhmns> speaking of that
[16:55:41] <Eviltwin> They should be separable
[16:55:45] <destryalhmns> do css files get cached?
[16:55:52] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: Everything gets cached
[16:56:00] <destryalhmns> even htm?
[16:56:02] <Eviltwin> Yup
[16:56:06] <Eviltwin> Everything
[16:56:13] <E289> eviltwin so i have to use id="some_id" on all my buttons?
[16:56:35] <Eviltwin> E289: Depends on what you're doing
[16:56:42] <Eviltwin> If you have a bunch of buttons that share the same behavior
[16:56:43] <E289> well as replacement for all my onclicks
[16:56:49] <Eviltwin> Use a class for it
[16:56:53] <Eviltwin> And bind to that class
[16:56:54] <zulax> destryalhmns, i use FF on private mode , think it helps
[16:57:02] <Eviltwin> If it's a button with a specific behavior, then an ID works
[16:57:13] <E289> ah. but basically all buttons need to be identified
[16:57:15] <E289> with ID or class?
[16:57:26] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: It might help but the browsers are pretty much designed to cache no matter what
[16:57:38] <Eviltwin> E289: They should be identifiable through some means, yes
[16:57:45] <Eviltwin> Either that or constructed dynamically
[16:57:55] <E289> oh.. because i wont be able to bind now without ID/class. what is constructed dynamically?
[16:57:56] <Eviltwin> But that gets into a whole 'nother field
[16:58:25] <Eviltwin> E289: You can use JavaScript to construct new elements / HTML
[16:58:32] <zulax> if i have a function in a external file and i load it, but if nothing is calling that function, will any syntax error in the funvtion matter?
[16:58:44] <Eviltwin> Which is useful if you don't know at load how many of some fields or whatever you're going to want
[16:59:05] <E289> Eviltwin - ah. okay i understand now. thaank you
[16:59:19] <Eviltwin> zulax: Syntax errors prevent the rest of a JS file from being processed
[16:59:23] <Eviltwin> If you're in the middle of processing a function
[16:59:27] <Eviltwin> That function will be undefined
[16:59:35] <zulax> but the function is never called, then?
[16:59:36] <Eviltwin> The browser will start loading the next file
[16:59:44] <Eviltwin> If the function is never called, you're fine
[16:59:54] <zulax> ok. thanks, that helps
[16:59:54] <Eviltwin> If it is, at run time you will get an undefined error
[17:00:11] <Eviltwin> But it's a bad to have a page that has errors
[17:00:18] <Eviltwin> bad practice*
[17:00:23] <Eviltwin> Even if the page "works"
[17:00:43] <zulax> i know, just cant figure out why my page is breaking :( everthing was working before dinner!
[17:00:44] <Eviltwin> It does mean the browser has to work a little harder to recover from it
[17:00:54] <Eviltwin> zulax: Use some kind of versioning :P
[17:01:00] <Eviltwin> I gotta go
[17:01:04] <Eviltwin> Best of luck to all
[17:01:06] <zulax> Eviltwin, i m using git, but i messed up
[17:01:08] <zulax> thanks Eviltwin
[17:01:34] <destryalhmns> hey
[17:01:45] <destryalhmns> im doing a side project
[17:02:04] <destryalhmns> its a
[17:02:27] <destryalhmns> ....this is a very original use of the internet so brace yourselves...
[17:02:37] <destryalhmns> DATING SITE!!!!
[17:03:02] <destryalhmns> anyone want to help with a home made intellect test?
[17:03:09] <destryalhmns> jquery will be used to validate it..
[17:06:34] <destryalhmns> you guys all know and respect me, would i be doing this if there werent some kind of good idea behind it???
[17:13:09] <mansoor> destryalhmns: i neither know you, nor respect you :(
[17:13:46] <destryalhmns> sir
[17:14:11] <destryalhmns> that is because we have not worked together yet, i assure you i am a class act....
[17:14:40] <destryalhmns> i need help because...
[17:14:57] <destryalhmns> apparantly im too filled with hatred to create an intellect test (hopefully that makes sense)
[17:15:43] <zulax> Eviltwin, my problem was my browsers were not executing getScript() functions! so had to configure the settins and now its a charm
[17:18:14] <mansoor> destryalhmns: got github account?
[17:18:24] <mansoor> or equivalent
[17:18:28] <destryalhmns> i do
[17:18:46] <destryalhmns> use that?
[17:18:55] <mansoor> yes sir/ma'am
[17:19:00] <destryalhmns> lol okay
[17:19:02] <destryalhmns> ill try it
[17:19:15] <mansoor> wait so you have one or not have one?
[17:19:37] <destryalhmns> i have one, its just apparantly seething with hatred
[17:19:54] <destryalhmns> it not based on any like actual study
[17:20:09] <destryalhmns> just my best attempt at making an objective guess about who is smart and who is stupid
[17:20:10] <mansoor> wait what are you talking 'bout? i'm talking about github
[17:20:38] <destryalhmns> heres what i gots (values to answers are not assigned yet)
[17:21:27] <destryalhmns> http://pastebin.com/MCAKB2zE
[17:21:34] <destryalhmns> ~20 questions would be nice
[17:22:04] <destryalhmns> the idea is that someone can do it drunk or stoned and you can still get a general idea of how intelligent/reasonable they are without anyone having to think too hard
[17:23:06] <destryalhmns> ala a way to rate someones intelligence quickly and easily on a dating site... and users would be given he answers at the end and if they cared enough they could go back and retake the tes
[17:32:27] <destryalhmns> cause if you have ever used eharmony...
[17:32:41] <destryalhmns> the data is very restrictive
[17:33:00] <sunscreen> Wishing every one  a Merrry Xmas from UnityRadioNet & Friends
[17:33:22] <destryalhmns> im sorry if somene is about to say this should strictly be ONLY about jquery stuff but for christs sake take 5 minutes and read the w3c tutorials and you know jquery
[17:43:06] <destryalhmns> this is about 700x more complicated than i ws hoping for
[17:43:18] <destryalhmns> and the neighbors dog is barking...
[17:43:32] <luke_66> hi everyone
[17:48:11] <destryalhmns> sup dog
[17:51:10] <luke_66> i have a problem using jquery ui and dialog() function: "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'dialog'". i've googled around many people with the same problem solved that issue with a correct inclusion of jquery library. this is the header: http://pastebin.com/e1cTKGK9 and this is the gpf1.js source: http://pastebin.com/0jXhU503. i'm still looking for a solution over the in
[17:51:10] <luke_66> ternet but i havent found yet. any idea? thanx
[18:04:56] <destryalhmns> going to work on other parts of the site until the intellect test is resolved to something reasonable
[18:04:58] <spiffie> you need to call dialog on a passed element, not on the jquery function itself.
[18:05:16] <destryalhmns> will post results along the way, if you steal my code i will stab  yo in the heart

[18:30:36] <sk8> hi i am trying to get a drop down to work
[18:31:03] <destryalhmns> and if you do animate?
[18:31:27] <sk8> this is my jquery code
[18:31:27] <sk8> http://pastebin.com/mcvg5z4Z
[18:31:50] <sk8> i am trying to close the dropdown if someone clicks outside the box
[18:32:11] <sk8> but right now its just opening and closing when i click on the button
[18:32:11] <destryalhmns> help me out here im drunk, but i do code jquery for a living, im not the best but i can get things done
[18:32:41] <]Darker[> if I animate
[18:32:47] <]Darker[> the alements copied
[18:32:51] <]Darker[> are totally messed
[18:33:28] <destryalhmns> how so? can you post the htm?
[18:33:32] <]Darker[> for istance, the first element appears too times
[18:33:47] <]Darker[> two*
[18:34:06] <]Darker[> I don't have it now, But i can write it in few minutes
[18:34:38] <spiffie> I'm no wizard with animate, but I don't think the callback function in animate will prevent the remaining iterations of the each loop from running.
[18:35:13] <spiffie> so your whole each loop is probably running before the first animate is even finished
[18:35:19] <]Darker[> spiffie, you are probably right
[18:35:26] <]Darker[> in fact if I don't use the callback
[18:35:39] <]Darker[> data is ok
[18:35:41] <]Darker[> but...
[18:35:43] <]Darker[> in this way
[18:35:56] <]Darker[> I copied content before the animation

[18:37:31] <sk8> hey guys can you guys look at my question too :)
[18:37:36] <sk8> kinda stuck
[18:38:12] <destryalhmns> Darker, any chance you can boil the dwon further?
[18:38:51] <destryalhmns> Without html how is anyone supposed to know what isnt appearing right?
[18:39:10] <]Darker[> I am writing it
[18:39:14] <]Darker[> :)
[18:39:15] <]Darker[> tnx
[18:39:45] <destryalhmns> k hirry cause i am down to 1 eye
[18:40:06] <spiffie> sk8: you probably need to stop the click propagation, too, or the click event in the dropdown will continue up to the body and trigger the close
[18:40:55] <sk8> thats what its doing
[18:41:22] <sk8> basically i am trying to recreate the menu drop down like facebook notifications
[18:41:46] <sk8> cuz it stays once clicked but if someone clicks outside the dropdown it closes
[18:42:56] <spiffie> you're using preventDefault but you didn't stop DOM bubbling of the click event
[18:43:36] <sk8> how do i do that?
[18:43:59] <spiffie> ? stopPropagation
[18:43:59] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[18:44:06] <sk8> oh sorry i am still new
[18:44:07] <sk8> :)
[18:44:10] <sk8> thanks ill try that
[18:44:10] <spiffie> no worries
[18:44:18] <spiffie> it's faster for bot-t to type it than me ;)
[18:45:06] <destryalhmns> k darker im out
[18:45:10] <destryalhmns> too wasted
[18:45:32] <sk8> one more question
[18:45:39] <]Darker[> ok
[18:45:43] <]Darker[> tnx for your time :)
[18:45:45] <sk8> instead of using body.click can i use blur()?
[18:46:22] <sk8> i guess like $("#topbarUserLink").blur(function(e) {
[18:46:26] <destryalhmns> apples and oranges
[18:46:35] <sk8> its not working thats why
[18:46:39] <sk8> couldnt figure out why
[18:46:49] <destryalhmns> do you want the vent to fire when they click on it or leave it?
[18:47:27] <sk8> when they click anything else so i figured if they click anything else it will lose focus
[18:47:28] <sk8> right?
[18:47:53] <sk8> the body click works but the body is limited in height so if i click at the very bottom of the page it doesnt work
[18:47:58] <destryalhmns> click is when they click on it, blur is when the focs (focus of the page) goes to something else
[18:48:15] <sk8> right
[18:48:38] <sk8> thats why i figured if the lose focus from that button it would be better right?
[18:48:41] <destryalhmns> yes, that is right, but only if the control in question was in focus before they clicked
[18:49:38] <sk8> right
[18:49:45] <sk8> but thats not working i am not sure why
[18:50:00] <destryalhmns> first
[18:50:00] <]Darker[> http://pastebin.com/aqi9rAyC
[18:50:03] <]Darker[> that's it
[18:50:10] <]Darker[> i copied the jquery too
[18:50:18] <destryalhmns> no more pastebin for me toingith.... too much reading...
[18:50:19] <]Darker[> the look is terrible
[18:50:31] <]Darker[> but the functionality is right
[18:50:39] <destryalhmns> make sure it works on focus alert yes i am in focus
[18:50:50] <destryalhmns> then make sure it fires on blur
[18:51:00] <]Darker[> basically when you click on a div
[18:51:10] <]Darker[> the content moves to the first block
[18:51:10] <destryalhmns> if you got both working the rest of the problem should be no problem
[18:51:13] <sk8> let me try that
[18:51:57] <]Darker[> and all the blocks BEFORE the one clicked move
[18:52:15] <]Darker[> so, if u click the last, everything will move
[18:52:49] <sk8> your a genius
[18:52:57] <sk8> i just created a .focus(); when its clicked
[18:53:05] <sk8> and now i can use .blur
[18:53:09] <sk8> thank you :)

[19:07:17] <JCDenton> I must really be missing something here, can anyone tell me what in the world is wrong here? Because I'm at a compelte lost, this should be working: http://pastie.org/3069326 , this is the script: http://sul4bh.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/jquery-snowfall-plugin/
[19:07:31] <JCDenton> 1. Include the plugin source in your page - Done, 2. Invoke the plugin - Done
[19:07:36] <JCDenton> Doesn't work.
[19:14:06] <JCDenton> So I'm assuming this script broken, can anyone recommend me one that works?
[19:14:21] <JCDenton> Because according to the documentaiton, I'm doing nothing wrong.
[19:17:53] <spiffie> hm, it works at jsfidde
[19:17:58] <spiffie> jsfiddle
[19:28:39] <JCDenton> That's really odd then. It doesn't work for me
[19:29:14] <JCDenton> Not even on jsfiddle, actually.
[19:29:37] <JCDenton> nevermind
[19:29:42] <JCDenton> It does work on jsfiddle
[19:29:48] <JCDenton> but not when running it from an html doc
[19:29:57] <JCDenton> Maybe my browser is fscking up
[20:03:31] <brianfreud> Question...  I'm looking at live, on, delegate, etc.  But they all seem to want some discrete event, and if there is one for this, I don't know it.  If I want to run function foo() on any *new* {selector match} that may occur (ie, new elements added to a page), how to do it?
[20:09:13] <dismist> brian: .live
[20:09:30] <brianfreud> dismist, that only works if there's an event I can capture.
[20:09:45] <dismist> is this a high level question
[20:10:31] <brianfreud> ie, I want to add a button into any new "fieldset.foo" that is added.  Then I can use on/live/delegate on that button - but how to get the button in there in the first place?
[20:10:57] <dismist> oh
[20:11:05] <dismist> .appendTo
[20:11:30] <dismist> $('<button code').appendTo('fieldset');
[20:11:48] <brianfreud> yes, but that only works on existing "fieldset.foo"s, not ones added (by other code) afterwards
[20:12:37] <brianfreud> Something along the lines of a "added to DOM" event, I guess
[20:13:19] <Octane> so im creating a page that will have draggable elements that can be dropped into SVG-generated shapes. i initially thought to use jquery for dragging/dropping and raphael for drawing the shapes. is this the right way to go?
[20:15:16] <brianfreud> ah, DOMNodeInserted
[20:18:09] <surfdue> For some reason my code is being loaded with .load into a div but the div elements arnt getting our styles as pur our style.css file
[20:18:16] <surfdue> is there a way to fix this?
[20:22:07] <surfdue> nvm
[20:34:39] <Eviltwin> Shapeways does pretty high detail
[20:36:00] <Eviltwin> Wrong window
[22:22:26] <djQuery> anyone have somethign to supply code completion for node in VS?
[22:24:53] <scorphus> VS?
[22:25:01] <djQuery> visual studio
[22:25:04] <scorphus> oh
[22:25:18] <scorphus> nothing here, sorry
[22:26:40] <djQuery> google aint showin me much either
[22:26:53] <djQuery> or my google fu is lacking today
[22:31:10] <djQuery> lol asked in wrong channel
[22:55:12] <muhoo> if i'm inside a div, and i put a script tag in there, how can i get $(this) ?
[22:55:33] <muhoo> in other words, i want to optionally run some jquery on whatever element the <script> is inside of
[23:34:30] <axilaris> hi... does anyone knows how to get the name of a json object ? like if you have "name": "john", i want to get the text name
[23:41:05] <mattgifford> axilaris: So, it sounds like your json is an array of objects where each object has a name attribute. Is that correct?
