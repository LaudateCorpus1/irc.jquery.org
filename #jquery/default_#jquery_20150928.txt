[01:35:29] <Webkiwi> how's it
[03:32:18] <fabio> Hello everyone
[03:32:30] <fabio> how can i select a select that has display none?
[03:32:46] <fabio> im trying like this $("select[name=country]:hidden")
[03:33:20] <Uhkis> did you try without the horrible attribute selector?
[03:33:36] <fabio> Uhkis, huh?
[03:33:52] <fabio> without the hidden thing?
[03:33:52] <Uhkis> only select:hidden
[03:35:39] <fabio> it doesnt work
[03:39:51] <guessx> got a jsfiddle of it?
[03:45:57] <blinky_> Hi guys, trying to using Select2 and not having much fun.  I have the script on my page and from what I can figure it is working.  I am able to using the console.log to see the returned array but I am not getting any results on the page.  Any ideas what I am doing wrong.  Here is all the code - http://jsfiddle.net/h2x1a5a0/
[03:47:33] <Uhkis> blinky_: you forgot to add select2 to that fiddle
[03:48:36] <blinky_> Uhkis, Could not figure out how to to be honest.  I added external resources and nothing happened so I removed them.
[04:02:48] <hellyeah> hey
[04:03:07] <hellyeah> is there any method in jquery format datetime to another format?
[04:03:15] <Cork> no
[04:03:28] <hellyeah> humm
[04:03:42] <Cork> ?g strformat date jquery
[04:03:42] <b-ot> Cork: Rails4 using ajax and jquery to display a date using strftime in ... â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25634429/rails4-using-ajax-and-jquery-to-display-a-date-using-strftime-in-format-m-d-y
[04:03:46] <Cork> heh
[04:04:01] <Cork> https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat
[04:05:07] <hellyeah> Cork: i need to format the table when you click timeslice here it is sorted http://jsfiddle.net/19at0hwo/21/ this is format i have and is not sortable. Any advice to succed that?
[04:06:26] <hellyeah> github page will help?
[04:07:14] <Uhkis> sorts just fine
[04:07:49] <hellyeah> Uhkis: in second link or in first link?
[04:08:04] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/19at0hwo/21/
[04:09:01] <hellyeah> yea it worked here
[04:10:10] <hellyeah> Uhkis: but not here https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/7/
[04:10:30] <hellyeah> datetime format is different i didnt work probaby because of this format difference
[04:11:49] <Uhkis> hellyeah: probably because you're double loading jquery?
[04:13:10] <hellyeah> what
[04:14:20] <hellyeah> Uhkis: are you sure you check correct address there is no double load here https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/7/
[04:14:42] <Uhkis> external resources
[04:14:45] <Uhkis> jquery-latest
[04:14:59] <Uhkis> that wasn't the problem tho, it's your formatter
[04:15:40] <hellyeah> i load jquery latest min and tablesorter is there anything wrong here?
[04:16:23] <hellyeah> if you click URL it worked
[04:16:28] <hellyeah> it will work
[04:16:31] <Uhkis> yes, why are you loading jquery twice
[04:17:42] <hellyeah> which file i load twice i dont understand
[04:18:03] <Uhkis> first you load 2. something from jsfiddle menu, then again on the external
[04:20:04] <hellyeah> i loaded jquery from framework and extension then in external source i load latest and tablesorter https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/8/
[04:22:35] <Uhkis> yes, that's exactly what i said
[04:23:08] <hellyeah> latest and tablesorter are part of jquery tablesorter plugin.
[04:24:07] <Uhkis> ..
[04:25:17] <fabio> one thing
[04:25:25] <hellyeah> Uhkis: i really dont see what you meant :XD
[04:25:36] <fabio> Why my jquery code works fine on chome console but not on page?
[04:26:07] <Uhkis> hellyeah: that you're double loading jquery, but that's not the problem
[04:26:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:26:42] <hellyeah> problem seems datetime formats
[04:26:53] <hellyeah> i guess tablesorter is not riend with that format
[04:27:39] <Uhkis> [14:14] < Uhkis> that wasn't the problem tho, it's your formatter
[04:29:00] <hellyeah> Uhkis: so backend?
[04:29:51] <Uhkis> Date.parse(s) returns NaN
[04:33:10] <hellyeah> humm
[04:33:15] <hellyeah> what should i do
[04:33:41] <cannap> what
[04:34:23] <hellyeah> what
[04:34:29] <STEVOOO> Say what what
[04:41:20] <droid909> what
[04:41:40] * hellyeah vak vak
[04:42:39] <Uhkis> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/10/ :-D
[04:43:13] <hellyeah> hahah
[04:48:53] <hellyeah> Uhkis: can i ask one more question why stacktrace is not sorted when you click https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/11/
[04:49:28] <Uhkis> hellyeah: it is, you're probably just clicking the "Output" button there
[04:49:39] <Uhkis> hellyeah: try a bit more to the left
[04:50:20] <hellyeah> aha
[04:50:22] <hellyeah> yes
[04:50:29] <hellyeah> well i am gonna say what the hell
[04:50:37] <hellyeah> what is the reason of that?
[04:50:54] <Uhkis> what the hellyeah? :D
[04:51:14] <Uhkis> it's to mark which box is which, the same thing is in other iframes there
[04:59:30] <dudeJi> Hey guys , i have two event listeners for a single button , on click with id and on click with class. My problem is my onClick with id comes as second call and onClick with class comes first .
[05:01:17] <Cork> dudeJi: what selector you use doesn't matter
[05:01:25] <Cork> events are element based not selector based
[05:01:37] <Cork> and they fire in the order they where bound
[05:02:11] <blinky_> If I am echoing a li using php how do I use jquery to collect the ID.  I have tried 2 difference methods and I am unable to get the ID. - http://jsfiddle.net/sqnvdbg7/
[05:03:13] <Cork> blinky_: you need to include the pare where you handle the html you get in
[05:05:01] <blinky_> Cork, Sorry do you mean this? - http://jsfiddle.net/sqnvdbg7/1/
[05:05:16] <Cork> yes
[05:05:46] <Cork> blinky_: and you want to collect the ids in the success callback?
[05:06:03] <blinky_> Yes mate, which ever name is selected I need the ID for that name
[05:06:24] <Cork> uh
[05:06:27] <Cork> what?
[05:06:37] <Cork> what name are you talking about?
[05:07:12] <Cork> blinky_: btw don't use event attributes (just noticed the php code)
[05:07:20] <blinky_> Cork, The php is creating a list of names, each name has an id.  If the user selectes a name from the list I need the ID of that name selected
[05:07:23] <Cork> move the event handler out into a static listener
[05:08:13] <Cork> blinky_: also you might want to use data-id instead of id, as id has to be page unique
[05:09:47] <Cork> blinky_: http://jsfiddle.net/sqnvdbg7/2/
[05:10:35] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/sqnvdbg7/3/ also for the autocomplete
[05:14:14] <blinky_> Cork, Still not producing anything in the console.  I have also tried pulling the attribute for the id and that is not pulling anything either?!
[05:14:40] <Cork> blinky_: did you check the changes i did both in the html and js?
[05:14:53] <Cork> the fiddle does give you the values
[05:18:10] <blinky_> Cork, Yeah I have made all the changes you suggested, I am wondering if it has something to do with the php echoing the LI entries to the page.
[05:21:54] <blinky_> Cork, Sorted cheers
[05:32:50] <AbuDhar> var link = $('<a/>', { href: data[index].link,
[05:32:52] <AbuDhar>                                                     text: data[index].name });
[05:32:53] <AbuDhar> is this invalid?
[05:34:21] <xec-> AbuDhar: jQuery expects valid html, and <a> is not a void element (so "<a />" or "<a/>" is invalid html
[05:34:40] <AbuDhar> so how can I do it?
[05:34:56] <AbuDhar> how could I rewrite that line?
[05:35:14] <xec-> $("<a></a>", {...})
[05:36:48] <AbuDhar> thanks
[05:38:39] <AbuDhar> I appreciate it!!!!
[05:39:08] <xec> np :)
[05:40:10] <AbuDhar> can I add you on facebook or Skype?
[05:42:24] <xec> no, but feel free to ask more questions in here (lets other people benefit from answers too)
[06:12:11] <hellyeah> i have two pages ione page has tables one page has buttons. When user click buttons i will call the table from other page by using QueryString.
[06:12:11] <hellyeah> with this, spesific rows of table binds to button
[06:12:31] <hellyeah> but my buttons need to be animated and will have a counter that indicate there is a problem or not in that table. How many red records in the table etc.
[06:12:32] <hellyeah> but table is in another page. What i wonder is, is there a way to get spesifict part of dom from another page
[06:24:42] <_el_fer_> Hi all
[06:25:59] <_el_fer_> I would like to know guys, anyone has experience performing multipart upload?
[08:19:40] <goodygum> how can i easily as possible check if json is loaded by my site?
[08:20:00] <goodygum> i fought with CORS problem, and now i want to check if anything is okay
[08:20:32] <nodist> see if its loaded through the console?
[08:21:17] <NoiseEee> what do you mean 'if json is loaded by my site'
[08:21:56] <goodygum> NoiseEee: i need to get a json file thru API of some service
[08:22:20] <NoiseEee> goodygum: so in the callback in your script, tell chrome/yourbrowser to stop
[08:22:26] <NoiseEee> and look at the response
[08:22:59] <goodygum> do you recommend any library to show the structure of a JSON file?
[08:23:21] <goodygum> i've tried to use jqtree, but it doesn't work like in an example
[08:23:39] <goodygum> jsTree maybe? something quicker/easier to install?
[08:23:43] <NoiseEee> the chrome console does a pretty good job
[08:23:49] <NoiseEee> why do you need a library?
[08:24:08] <NoiseEee> or you can use jsonprettyprint.com
[08:24:38] <goodygum> but i want to print it in my website
[08:24:44] <NoiseEee> as raw JSON?
[08:25:03] <goodygum> could be raw, could be just an OK alert ;)
[08:25:35] <goodygum> i'll try this jstree
[08:33:57] <Dr-007> i am using textarea = wrapper.find('textarea'); to find a textrarea in my wrapper div
[08:34:08] <Dr-007> what if i want to find multiple textareas?
[08:35:09] <_el_fer_> doesnt "find" finds all of the textareas inside wrapper?
[08:35:38] <Dr-007> i dont believe so, let me test it
[08:36:21] <Dr-007> ah, it does :)
[08:36:25] <_el_fer_> good
[08:36:35] <_el_fer_> you got first() method to get only one
[08:36:39] <_el_fer_> only the first *
[08:36:50] <Dr-007> allright, thanks!
[08:36:54] <_el_fer_> no problem
[08:37:07] <Dr-007> the function that handles the found elements doesnt test if its one or multiple
[08:37:07] <_el_fer_> I have one question, sorry for the ones that already read it...
[08:37:11] <Dr-007> so i should modify that
[08:37:32] <Dr-007> shoot!
[08:37:45] <_el_fer_> anyone have implemented the mechanism for multipart uploads?
[08:38:25] <_el_fer_> like the one supported by aws s3
[08:38:33] <Dr-007> multipart uploads?
[08:38:42] <duch_kazatel> _el_fer_ what are you looking for specifically?
[08:39:08] <_el_fer_> an implementation for this http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingRESTAPImpUpload.html
[08:39:44] <duch_kazatel> on the client site?
[08:39:48] <_el_fer_> yes
[08:39:51] <duch_kazatel> https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/javascript/post/Tx3EQZP53BODXWF/Announcing-the-Amazon-S3-Managed-Uploader-in-the-AWS-SDK-for-JavaScript
[08:40:18] <duch_kazatel> Under the "A Browser Example" heading
[08:41:38] <_el_fer_> I got it, I should include that AWS sdk js library
[08:41:48] <_el_fer_> i will give it a try
[08:41:59] <duch_kazatel> cool
[08:42:06] <_el_fer_> thanks duch_kazatel
[08:42:20] <duch_kazatel> don't thank me - thank google.
[08:42:54] <_el_fer_> thanks for being my personal googler ?)
[08:42:59] <Dr-007> hehehe
[08:43:16] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[08:43:21] <Dr-007> sometimes i dont know the good terms to google for
[08:43:22] <_el_fer_> I am a bit lost with this, to be honest I am not too familiar with browser coding ha
[08:43:51] <_el_fer_> its not my best coding skill
[08:44:05] <duch_kazatel> sure, but that page gives to a full example of how to use it.
[08:44:49] <duch_kazatel> just need that AWS.S3 function defined - probably in their JS SDK.
[08:45:38] <_el_fer_> yes, that was the problem, and that should have been my question, I couldnt find a good library to handle aws s3
[08:45:48] <duch_kazatel> you want the one they supply
[08:45:50] <dsc__>  11
[08:46:03] <_el_fer_> in  fact the app i am working with, doesnt have any s3 browser side support, so I guess I will have to add it
[08:46:05] <_el_fer_> yes
[08:46:17] <duch_kazatel> https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser/ ;)
[08:46:29] <duch_kazatel> something tells me this is where you'd want to start.
[08:46:51] <_el_fer_> absolutely
[08:47:24] <_el_fer_> I should have started here from day zero, I ve been looking for a backend ruby solution and it drove me crazy
[08:47:50] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[08:47:57] <duch_kazatel> because https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/ ...
[08:50:16] <_el_fer_> the problem is that I needed to first get the file from the browser, and the problem did not solved
[08:50:27] <duch_kazatel> ah
[08:50:53] <_el_fer_> anyway, I found a gem with a great description, that did what I needed but I could never make it work
[08:51:17] <_el_fer_> then i said, okay lets go full browserside
[08:51:20] <_el_fer_> then I came here :)
[08:52:29] <_el_fer_> I guess I will be around for a while, I had left irc forgotten but its always cool to hang around
[08:57:02] <motaka2> Hello in this file https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c6c2ce44c84c87b7dfcf  Iwhen I load the page in ajax mode the event is attached several times to getLangSelector()  how can I prevent this?
[08:57:24] <duch_kazatel> use a delegated listener instead.
[08:57:41] <duch_kazatel> and use it correctly.
[08:58:05] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Can you give me an example
[08:58:06] <motaka2> ?
[08:58:34] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - check the "type" for the selector argument.
[08:58:53] <duch_kazatel> also: a big plus of using a delegated listener is so you don't have to unbind and re-bind.
[09:00:11] <duch_kazatel> you should only need $('body').on('change', '#someparent select', change); - i don't know what your markup is so you'll need to change that argument to match your select.
[09:01:13] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I dont know how to do that
[09:01:18] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle then.
[09:03:51] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: deligation is using on
[09:03:55] <motaka2> I am using on
[09:05:15] <motaka2> but when I use this.selector the event works fine
[09:05:35] <motaka2> when I use the jquery object, it doesnt and it attached twice
[09:07:49] <NoiseEee> fiddle man, create a fiddle
[09:07:49] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 on is not delegation
[09:07:57] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, you need to use a string for that second arg.
[09:08:01] <duch_kazatel> not a jquery object.,
[09:08:03] <duch_kazatel> *object
[09:08:23] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: why should I use a string ?
[09:08:36] <duch_kazatel> because that's how you use it?
[09:08:43] <duch_kazatel> the docs say that argument takes a string.
[09:08:45] <duch_kazatel> not an object.
[09:09:48] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: It works with jq object, just the off part doesnt work and so when the page is loaded in ajax mode
[09:09:52] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:09:54] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't
[09:10:00] <motaka2> the event is attached twice
[09:10:03] <duch_kazatel> right.
[09:10:16] <duch_kazatel> that would be incorrect behavior.  use it the way it's documented and you'll have fewer issues ;)
[09:10:20] <duch_kazatel> also, don't use .off()
[09:10:20] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: the on part works with jq object
[09:10:26] <duch_kazatel> not correctly.
[09:11:00] <duch_kazatel> if you're using a delegated listener, the second argument to the method is a string.  using anything but a string won't function correctly.  also: a big reason to use the delegated syntax is so you don't need to remove the listener.
[09:11:09] <duch_kazatel> so i don't see why you're using .off().
[09:11:38] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: when you load pages dinamically there is no way but to use off
[09:11:43] <duch_kazatel> uh
[09:12:03] <duch_kazatel> that's why you use delegation - if you're loading things dynamically, you use delegation so you don't need to re-bind your listeners.
[09:13:32] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: in a plugin I want to attach the the event only to current event
[09:13:39] <motaka2> current object
[09:13:39] <duch_kazatel> right, so only use it
[09:13:51] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: wait
[09:13:53] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to use .off()
[09:14:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/27n5yypk/
[09:14:57] <duch_kazatel> like - pretty basic.  don't dynamically create handlers if that's what you're doing.
[09:15:16] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: This is my code, the last section is the code I sent you in the last paste  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a2e65d7398b57d625fb5
[09:15:49] <duch_kazatel> that's... really inefficient.
[09:16:23] <duch_kazatel> why are you using a delegated listener here?
[09:16:31] <duch_kazatel> you're basically defeating the entire point of using one.
[09:19:41] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: What is teh right way then ?
[09:20:06] <duch_kazatel> do your delegated listener outside of the each - why are you dynamically determining the selector?
[09:21:11] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c28a08e4e6f0fbed857a
[09:21:23] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:21:26] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[09:21:34] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: ?
[09:21:43] <duch_kazatel> use a delegated listener - that's a good thing to do.  could you clarify what this code is trying to do?
[09:22:08] <duch_kazatel> looks like some kind of validator?
[09:23:29] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: It finds all this.selctor area and then for each of those areas it it finds a <select> and then when you change the select options it loades the new translation for the selected language
[09:23:46] <motaka2> this.selector areas
[09:24:07] <duch_kazatel> why is this a plugin?
[09:24:25] <duch_kazatel> because this could be compacted down to a much shorter handler.
[09:24:39] <motaka2> So i could use it with several translation sections
[09:24:50] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't change anything.
[09:25:16] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Can you give me sample? I dont know how to make shorter
[09:25:27] <duch_kazatel> did you see what i showed you earlier?
[09:25:37] <motaka2> Yupe
[09:25:43] <duch_kazatel> so apply that basic idea.
[09:25:50] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, i'll need a fiddle.
[09:27:15] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Since several js files work tpgether I dont know how to create the fiddle
[09:27:55] <duch_kazatel> errr, we don't want the whole page, just the basic idea.
[09:32:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/27n5yypk/1/ motaka2
[09:33:05] <duch_kazatel> see how the handler is the same for all of the ones that get added?
[09:36:15] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I am using your way and the duplication is soved
[09:36:52] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: but the ajax function in chnage() method send three request
[09:37:55] <duch_kazatel> you're binding in that .each() still.
[09:38:16] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you want.
[09:39:03] <dopie> using jQuery how can I click on a link ( it redirects to another page ) and then have that link have an additional class of "foo"
[09:39:19] <duch_kazatel> you want to add a class?
[09:39:24] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: not the change method is called three times, just the $.ajax in change is called three times
[09:39:53] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 that means you're calling change() three times.
[09:40:20] <duch_kazatel> dopie you want to add a class to a clicked link?
[09:40:46] <dopie> yes
[09:40:53] <duch_kazatel> $(this).addClass('foo')
[09:40:54] <dopie> i did a onClick
[09:40:58] <duch_kazatel> uerr.
[09:41:05] <duch_kazatel> in your html?
[09:41:07] <duch_kazatel> don't use that.
[09:41:13] <duch_kazatel> use your js file.
[09:41:18] <dopie> yes in my js file
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> there's no "onclick" in jquery - there's .click(function() {}) and .on('click', function() {})
[09:41:56] <dopie> yes
[09:42:09] <duch_kazatel> then you just need to use $(this).addClass('foo') in there.
[09:42:20] <arup_r> I want to add a new element inside the div.comment as its last child.. what is the method ?
[09:42:30] <duch_kazatel> .append() arup_r
[09:42:30] <arup_r> .append() is not what I want
[09:42:34] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:42:36] <arup_r> no
[09:42:36] <duch_kazatel> that's what append done.
[09:42:40] <duch_kazatel> *does
[09:43:00] <duch_kazatel> "Description: Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements." >.>
[09:43:08] <arup_r> I want to add inside the div.comment.. it is appending after div.comment
[09:43:27] <duch_kazatel> that's how it works.
[09:43:33] <duch_kazatel> it appends to whatever element you target.
[09:43:51] <dopie> duch_kazatel,  ok...  now here is the problem when I click on the link it adds the class than it redirects to another page and the class is gone since it redirected/loaded a new page?
[09:43:54] <dopie> duch_kazatel,  ok...  now here is the problem when I click on the link it adds the class than it redirects to another page and the class is gone since it redirected/loaded a new page....
[09:44:00] <dopie> sorry for the double post
[09:44:13] <duch_kazatel> dopie then you need to handle that on your server side.
[09:44:26] <arup_r> u r right
[09:44:32] <duch_kazatel> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vdtzmLhL/ :)
[09:44:50] <cjohnson> I have nested unordered lists, and each <li> has a class of dd-item. An li can contain a bunch of form fields, and it can also contain nested lists. what's the best way to do $(li).find(':input') while excluding grandchild inputs?
[09:45:08] <cjohnson> I was thinking maybe .not('.dd-item :input') but that seems a little clunky
[09:45:37] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:45:45] <duch_kazatel> so you want the "first level" inputs?
[09:46:09] <nland> how can I POST call where CORS is not enabled
[09:46:22] <cjohnson> yes duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/vrvvkeoy/
[09:46:43] <cjohnson> I'm looping over $('.dd-item') and for each item I want to pull only the inputs under that level
[09:47:01] <cjohnson> the inputs aren't going to be direct children so I can't do > :input
[09:47:34] <dopie> duch_kazatel, ummm ok....
[09:48:26] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: no when in the first line of change I put console.log("I am here") it is outputed just once
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 check to make sure you don't see a "3" to the far right of that.
[09:48:58] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:49:24] <NoiseEee> cjohnson: children() will only iterate one level
[09:50:35] <cjohnson> NoiseEee: the lis could be wrapped in a series of divs
[09:50:48] <cjohnson> that's why I can't just do the literal level number
[09:51:19] <cjohnson> Well it may be clunky but I think it will work... $(li).find(':input').not('.dd-item :input') you think this will do what I want?
[09:51:25] <cjohnson> where li = each .dd-item
[09:51:47] <NoiseEee> dunno :)
[09:51:58] <NoiseEee> you can't add a class or anything to help things along?
[09:52:15] <cjohnson> NoiseEee: no this is for a nestable plugin
[09:52:21] <cjohnson> users can drag n drop the order of their nested items
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> helluva day
[10:02:17] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: Do you have any idea?
[10:02:20] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[10:02:51] <motaka3> There is no three in fron of the output but the function is till called 3 times
[10:02:59] <duch_kazatel> show me a screenshot of your console.
[10:03:09] <duch_kazatel> because it really sounds like you're calling that function three times.
[10:06:42] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: http://picpaste.com/Screen-dvHFdvce.png
[10:07:40] <duch_kazatel> that picture doesn't work.  tries to load and then breaks.
[10:07:40] <duch_kazatel> weird,
[10:09:56] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2015-09-28_20_39_11-VpsJIeTt.png
[10:10:18] <duch_kazatel> weird.  dunno then!
[10:10:59] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: :)
[10:11:35] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you are calling it three times but without seeing a fiddle or something else it's kind of hard to know.
[10:11:55] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: ok thank you
[11:03:41] <Dr-007> i'm attaching a jquery click whenever stuff loads via ajax.
[11:04:00] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[11:04:02] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[11:04:03] <Dr-007> somehow i'm getting multiple binds
[11:04:04] <Dr-007> 4
[11:04:04] <Dr-007> click
[11:04:05] <duch_kazatel> avoid the headache
[11:04:18] <Uhkis> what do you mean somehow
[11:04:20] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, i'm ussing drupals attach method
[11:04:27] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[11:04:29] <Uhkis> you just told why
[11:04:40] <Dr-007> which is build for jquery calls
[11:04:42] <duch_kazatel> use jquery's delegated syntax for .on()
[11:04:55] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, thanks i will try that
[11:05:20] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, are you Dutch?
[11:05:34] <Dr-007> or what does duch mean? :p
[11:05:40] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:05:50] <duch_kazatel> why does it matter? ;)
[11:05:59] <Uhkis> it means robertmaxrees!
[11:06:05] <duch_kazatel> sure yeah that.
[11:06:38] <Dr-007> it does't matter. but its not the first time i wondered that you might be dutch
[11:06:42] <Dr-007> because of your nickname
[11:06:46] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:06:59] <jbc8> how can the on('click', function(){}) work like the live function?
[11:06:59] <Dr-007> but if you meant Dutch you probably used dutch_kazatel
[11:07:00] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel, are you a duck?
[11:07:00] <duch_kazatel> it's pronounced kind of like "duke"
[11:07:02] <Dr-007> instead of duch
[11:07:11] <duch_kazatel> jbc8 you need to pass a second argument.
[11:07:22] <Uhkis> Dr-007: are you a doctor or james bond? :-)
[11:07:32] <Dr-007> Uhkis, both
[11:07:35] <Dr-007> :D
[11:07:42] <Uhkis> wow!
[11:07:42] <Dr-007> but i get your point
[11:07:46] <Dr-007> never mind!
[11:07:48] <jbc8> is the on function able to work on elements that haven't been created yet?
[11:07:59] <duch_kazatel> jbc8 if you use the delegated syntax, yess
[11:08:01] <Uhkis> yes
[11:08:06] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/wiO1gNA.png jbc8
[11:08:15] <duch_kazatel> see that .on() version?  that's what you wnat.
[11:08:47] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[11:09:19] <Dr-007> .on('click' didnt fix my problem. but ill google jquery event delegation
[11:09:23] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:09:25] <Dr-007> or just double click
[11:09:28] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click
[11:09:29] <Uhkis> shouldnt that be <=1.3 rather than +
[11:09:40] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', 'selector', function() {});
[11:09:45] <duch_kazatel> why don't people read the docs?
[11:10:10] <duch_kazatel> bbiab
[11:10:25] <Uhkis> bbiab?
[11:10:43] <Velveeta> be back in a bit
[11:10:44] <Uhkis> ?g bbiab
[11:10:44] <b-ot> Uhkis: Urban Dictionary: bbiab â†’ http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bbiab
[11:11:54] <Uhkis> duch and his weird acronyms
[11:36:41] <Dr-007> yeah, .on just doesn't work in this case. but i understand the principle
[11:36:48] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[11:36:57] <duch_kazatel> are you sure you're binding to the correct element.
[11:37:44] <Dr-007> http://pastebin.com/ajp5Ceic
[11:37:56] <Dr-007> well. no
[11:38:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not the way you want to do that.
[11:38:19] <Dr-007> visual_shortcodes()
[11:38:24] <duch_kazatel> bind to a parent element that exists on pageload.
[11:38:36] <Dr-007> but its a overlay
[11:38:41] <Dr-007> that gets loaded via ajax
[11:38:46] <Dr-007> and inject via jquery ui
[11:38:51] <Dr-007> by another module
[11:38:59] <Dr-007> so there's not really a parent
[11:39:15] <Dr-007> the overlay thing remains in the html DOM
[11:39:22] <Dr-007> and they only reload the content after the initial load
[11:39:56] <Dr-007> so i tried doing: $('.logo).on('click', buttons ...
[11:40:01] <Dr-007> but that doesn't work at all
[11:41:22] <Dr-007> but i think i will just try to request if my function was already bound to the buttons
[11:41:31] <Dr-007> so i can do it only once via that way
[11:44:00] <duch_kazatel> attach to the document instead then.
[11:44:55] <Dr-007> i did t hat too :)
[11:44:58] <Dr-007> did not work
[11:45:21] <Dr-007> anyway, thanks for your suggestion. i didnt know about this bubling
[11:45:30] <Dr-007> so the next time i need it for something not ajax related
[11:45:42] <Dr-007> i will (hopefully) think about your suggestion
[11:47:07] <JaCeN915> Hi all, i have an .on(â€˜changeâ€™) listener for form inputs, using google chrome, my inputs are â€˜auto-filledâ€™. seems like all forms except password types trigger the change event. Anyone have a work around for this?
[11:47:52] <JaCeN915> on page load, the chrome auto fill automatically triggers change, except for password
[11:48:16] <NoiseEee> is that really what you want though?
[11:49:22] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 ajax is exactly the case where you use it.
[11:49:45] <duch_kazatel> like, that's one of the primary use cases for using a delegated listener.
[11:49:47] <bango2> i named my dog ajax
[11:59:09] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, let me rephrase; i will hopefully think about your suggestion when i'm not javascripting in drupal 7.
[11:59:42] <duch_kazatel> https://www.drupal.org/node/1720586 fwiw.
[11:59:52] <duch_kazatel> has an example of how to delegate in drupal 7.
[12:21:21] <motaka3> find() returns jquery objects?
[12:24:00] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:28:43] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: firebug shows me <input value="" name="title">   when I console.log a find() result, but is says attr is not defined. so it seems it is not a jq object
[12:28:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:29:31] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/find/ - http://i.imgur.com/gCdCsBK.png
[12:29:48] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're doing something you shouldn't be - show us what you're trying to do.
[12:34:06] <motaka3> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/456a9089dbc9dab8ff46   the problem is on 63
[12:34:31] <duch_kazatel> var $field = getJqFields()[fieldIndex]; wat
[12:34:46] <duch_kazatel> accessing jquery objects by index like that is the issue.
[12:35:01] <duch_kazatel> use .eq() instead.
[12:35:08] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: How should I access them then ?
[12:35:17] <motaka3> ah ok
[12:35:36] <motaka3> thank you
[12:37:17] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: could you please tell me how I should do that ?
[12:37:46] <duch_kazatel> do what?
[12:37:48] <duch_kazatel> use .eq() instead.
[12:37:53] <andywww> iâ€™m reading up on/playing with the dependency injection way of loading jquery (function($){})(jQuery);
[12:38:04] <andywww> how might one go about loading the google maps library into that please?
[12:38:08] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:38:12] <duch_kazatel> that's not dependency injection.
[12:38:18] <duch_kazatel> that's an IIFE to protect the jquery name.
[12:38:20] <andywww> whats it called?
[12:38:28] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:38:38] <krz> what does $(document).off('click.popover.1234') do?
[12:38:44] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery off
[12:38:50] <duch_kazatel> dammit bot
[12:39:02] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/off/ krz
[12:39:17] <andywww> i see, is it possible to load google maps that way? or does it need to be part of a bigger function?
[12:39:35] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with how you load google maps.
[12:40:03] <duch_kazatel> load google maps like you normally would.  you can then access it from within that iife.
[12:40:16] <motaka3> duch_kazatel: thx, solved
[12:40:19] <duch_kazatel> all that code is doing is making sure you can use $ instead of the full jQuery name
[12:41:56] <Velveeta> if you want to see a DI way of loading jquery, you should look at an amd define() wrapper.. although the more pedantic developer will assert that *that*'s not DI either, it's a service locator
[12:42:21] <andywww> I have this:
[12:42:23] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a51626a5d8acc1ab2113
[12:42:28] <duch_kazatel> also: if the person in question here doesn't recognize what an IIFE is, that might just confuse them more ;)
[12:42:45] <andywww> but its giving me: Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined
[12:43:05] <duch_kazatel> andywww you still need to have a script that includes the google maps api.
[12:43:17] <Velveeta> so that sounds like either you're not loading your google script itself, or you're referencing it by the wrong name
[12:43:35] <andywww> what might that look like?
[12:43:46] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
[12:43:48] <andywww> no need to type code if you can just link me to what iâ€™m supposed to be searching for
[12:44:02] <duch_kazatel> andywww ^ that page is where you'd want to start.
[12:44:24] <Velveeta> damnit, you beat me to the link
[12:44:35] <duch_kazatel> i was already searching for it ;)
[12:46:02] <andywww> its not though, is it
[12:46:04] <andywww> at all
[12:46:25] <andywww> Iâ€™m trying to learn a specific technique iâ€™m not familiar with
[12:46:33] <Velveeta> dependency injection?
[12:46:37] <Velveeta> or IIFE
[12:46:37] <andywww> iâ€™m very much aware of using the google maps api
[12:46:43] <duch_kazatel> you haven't even loaded the script.
[12:46:49] <duch_kazatel> that's why you're getting that error.
[12:47:01] <Velveeta> ^^ that
[12:47:33] <duch_kazatel> so that's exactly what you want.  unless your question is more about why we use the IIFE or how to properly use them.
[12:47:43] <andywww> yes
[12:47:46] <duch_kazatel> the IIFE
[12:47:52] <andywww> Iâ€™m sorry, i thought that was clearer
[12:48:12] <duch_kazatel> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[12:48:24] <duch_kazatel> the IIFE is basically a one-time use scope.
[12:48:24] <Velveeta> so the reason for the IIFE is, like duch said, to protect the $ namespace while we use it
[12:48:41] <Velveeta> other libraries, or even other versions of jquery, can hijack the $ when they load, and set it to their own reference
[12:48:55] <duch_kazatel> so you can write your code in a producted area and reduce the chance of name coliisions while also reducing the amount of globals.
[12:49:08] <Velveeta> so we create a function enclosure to encapsulate the scope, and invoke it immediately, passing a single parameter in, jquery, to be received as $, which would take precedence over any $ from the outer scope
[12:49:25] <Velveeta> so that way, we can always be guaranteed that when we say $.anything, we mean jQuery.anything
[12:49:30] <Velveeta> inside of that block
[12:49:33] <duch_kazatel> has nothing to do with dependency injection.
[12:49:39] <karl_vul> hey all, im having some issues getting toggleclass to work properly in firefox (works fine in other browsers). after searching for the issue, it seems the event is not being passed from onclick to the toggle class event, but we are using html onclick not jquery .on('click', ... any suggestions?
[12:49:42] <duch_kazatel> in fact, it has nothing to do with dependencies.
[12:49:53] <andywww> i see
[12:50:00] <duch_kazatel> karl_vul use jquery's click handler.
[12:50:12] <duch_kazatel> don't use onclick in your markup - that's gross.
[12:50:15] <karl_vul> <a onclick="$('#select-arrow').toggleClass('rotate');"
[12:50:17] <karl_vul> lol
[12:50:22] <karl_vul> so it just wont work
[12:50:22] <duch_kazatel> don't use that.
[12:50:45] <andywww> what put me onto this was that i have seen code written by a colleague who has listed various parameters, leading me to believe they were dependencies
[12:50:46] <duch_kazatel> you can kind of make it work, but it's a hack - use .on() instead.
[12:50:47] <krz> ty duch_kazatel
[12:50:54] <andywww> i was obviously wrong
[12:50:59] <andywww> thanks for the clarification
[12:51:07] <duch_kazatel> andywww nah, not at all - they're just making sure somebody isn't coming along and redefining them.
[12:51:17] <duch_kazatel> you'll see people do that with jquery, window, undefined, etc.
[12:51:42] <arup_r> How can I replce the text area with a form ? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/NGbobb
[12:51:51] <duch_kazatel> arup_r what have you tried?
[12:51:57] <Velveeta> andywww: the difference here is the concept of a protected space with local variable scope vs a dependency-loading mechanism that can fetch your dependencies just in time
[12:52:03] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: Nothing.. dude..
[12:52:13] <arup_r> no idea what is the method available
[12:52:15] <andywww> so iâ€™d be wrong to try something like (function($, gmaps){})(jQuery, gmaps); or whatever?
[12:52:20] <andywww> that would be a step too far?
[12:52:24] <duch_kazatel> andrew9184 it'd be kind of awkward.
[12:52:33] <duch_kazatel> err andywww no need to protect gmaps
[12:52:39] <duch_kazatel> arup_r you want to replace using jquery?
[12:52:46] <arup_r> yes
[12:52:50] <andywww> gotcha
[12:52:52] <andywww> thanks
[12:53:03] <duch_kazatel> arup_r http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-replacement/
[12:53:04] <arup_r> got http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[12:53:07] <arup_r> lol
[12:53:50] <Velveeta> andywww: the reason most people protect the $ variable is that it's short and people use it as a shortcut rather than typing out the word jQuery 1000 times in their code... but for that same reason, other libraries use $ as an alias to themselves
[12:54:03] <Velveeta> if you're gonna pass gmaps in, and receive it as gmaps, you're not really saving anything
[12:54:05] <arup_r> " what have you tried?" pretty annoying.. don't use it man
[12:54:38] <duch_kazatel> arup_r we don't know how to help if we don't know why/how you're confused
[12:54:46] <duch_kazatel> so that's actually a 100% valid question :)
[12:54:53] <arup_r> ok
[12:55:01] <duch_kazatel> otherwise we're spoonfeeding you code ;)
[12:55:11] <arup_r> My boss kicking my ass.. so it is burning really...
[12:55:34] <Velveeta> you should go full metal jacket on your boss
[12:55:47] <arup_r> take my finger... You will feel it
[12:55:49] <Velveeta> and become the ideal soldier, i mean.. not the killing part
[12:55:49] <duch_kazatel> understandable, but the point of this chat is to help you learn, so that's why we ask those kinds of questions.
[12:56:02] <arup_r> no issue
[12:56:14] <arup_r> keep asking.. just don't ban me :(
[12:56:37] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to be a much bigger jerk to get a ban ;)
[12:57:18] <Velveeta> so you said you tried replaceWith already right?
[12:58:07] <arup_r> Velveeta: No I will try not.. That time Google was not giving me the method.. It was so cruel :(
[12:58:13] <arup_r> try now**
[12:58:39] <Velveeta> that damn google
[13:00:12] <SpecialTechnique> So, I'm used load() and it's telling me the page is 404, is there another way to do this? Will I have to resort to .ajax?
[13:00:17] <Uhkis> :-D
[13:01:50] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: ?
[13:04:26] <SpecialTechnique> NoiseEee, I'm trying to test something and I want to load() a div from /cart over to /checkout but when I do it, it gives me a 404 error (some kind of XMLRequest Script blocks me from using load I'm guessing)
[13:04:41] <NoiseEee> well a 404 error is file not found
[13:04:53] <NoiseEee> so i guess you're not hitting the correct resource/URL?
[13:05:03] <SpecialTechnique> I am, but it keeps saying 404
[13:05:19] <Velveeta> the load method routes through the ajax method itself anyway
[13:05:25] <Velveeta> so switching to the ajax method isn't going to make a difference
[13:05:31] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: and its obeying same origin policy and all?
[13:06:03] <SpecialTechnique> Ooops NoiseEee, that was the wrong question...
[13:06:32] <SpecialTechnique> I already figured that out, anyways, so when I use load it just erases everything in the div that I'm trying to append it to
[13:07:26] <alv-r-> does anyone know how can I get the options of a select given its jquery elem? I know I can $("#selectid options") for example, but I want to get its options on a function that I'm passing $("#selectid") only
[13:07:56] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: pastebin / fiddle
[13:08:15] <karl_vul> ok duch_kazatel , ive switched it to a jquery onclick event in the js file itself, the toggleClass is still not being applied
[13:08:31] <karl_vul> actually the onclick event itself is not working in firefox, it is working in chrome nicely
[13:10:05] <karl_vul> i feel like it may be a conflict with bootstrap data-toggle
[13:13:28] <alv-r-> .children() in case anyone was curious about it too :D
[13:15:49] <SpecialTechnique> NoiseEee; http://jsfiddle.net/rsjknbsm/
[13:17:28] <Velveeta> alv-r-: if you use .children() you risk getting optgroups also... if you're passing $('#selectid') to another function, and receiving it as, say, mySelect, you can just use something like mySelect.find('option')
[13:18:01] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: are you aware of what .load() does.
[13:18:27] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: "Â Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element."
[13:19:05] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: its doing exactly what you told it to do.  replace the content of $('.wl-page-header') with the returned data
[13:19:27] <Velveeta> except that it's apparently 404'ing on the url you're trying to access
[13:19:53] <Velveeta> so here's a question, if you look at your network tab in chrome, and find the 404 request, and right-click it and open that link in another tab, do you get the response you're expecting?
[13:20:05] <Velveeta> because if not, then the url is invalid, which is what i suspect
[13:20:21] <NoiseEee> Velveeta: i think he's past that and on to "anyways, so when I use load it just erases everything in the div that I'm trying to append it to"
[13:20:47] <Velveeta> ah ok, i assumed he was still getting that error and it was returning nothing, and thus, erasing everything in the div without adding any new content
[13:21:33] <SpecialTechnique> NoiseEee, would .get() work better for this?
[13:22:07] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: sure, or just a regular $.ajax();   then explicitly *append* the new data to the element.
[13:22:20] <SpecialTechnique> Yea
[13:28:08] <SpecialTechnique> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/rsjknbsm/1/ something wrong with that?
[13:28:32] <SpecialTechnique> I tried both append and appendTo
[13:31:54] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: uh wouldn't you want the things reversed?
[13:32:14] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: you want to append something to .wl-page-header
[13:32:31] <NoiseEee> right now you're appending .wl-page-header to .wl-cart-summary in the returned markup
[13:37:05] <tekkkz> Hello! Can someone maybe help me here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32812941/highlight-js-inline-mode-possible ?
[13:38:25] <SpecialTechnique> NoiseEee, I have it right, but I found out that in the returned data, it's not actually returning all the HTML, it's only returning a portion of it...
[13:39:00] <SpecialTechnique> Or at least I hope I have it right lol, but either way, the data returned doesn't have the div I'm trying to find
[13:39:27] <SpecialTechnique> which is weird, I thought it would return the whole page?
[13:41:30] <SpecialTechnique> Yup, that's the problem
[13:41:40] <SpecialTechnique> It's not returning all the HTML >_<
[13:53:42] <hsiisbis> Hi there, I'm new to Jquery - I'm trying to populate a series of HTML5 data fields (data-featherlight) with an image src taken from a parent class (.press-item img). I'm guessing I need to use the .each function but I'm a bit lost, if anyone can help I'd be grateful - here's the JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wpdeufub/
[13:55:02] <duch_kazatel> $(this).next().$(".press-info a") is where you're going wrong - you want .find()
[13:55:05] <duch_kazatel> not that second $
[13:57:59] <hsiisbis> hmmm, still struggling I'm afraid - sorry, again I'm new to this - here's the updated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wpdeufub/2/
[13:58:17] <duch_kazatel> lol - $(this).next().find(".press-info a")
[13:59:11] <hsiisbis> haha, let me try again
[14:00:54] <hsiisbis> hmmm still struggling to populate the data field - http://jsfiddle.net/wpdeufub/3/ - I'll search around though - I've bothered you enough, thanks!
[14:01:03] <Dr-007> $(this) does not exist
[14:01:16] <duch_kazatel> how are you verifying this hsiisbis?
[14:01:28] <Dr-007> $(".press-item img").each(function () {   should be      $(".press-item img").each(function (key, img) {
[14:01:37] <Dr-007> and $(this) should be $(img)
[14:01:41] <Dr-007> (i think)
[14:01:43] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 $(this) works
[14:01:45] <hsiisbis> ah thank you
[14:01:48] <hsiisbis> I'll tyr this
[14:01:50] <Dr-007> but duch_kazatel is the real expert
[14:01:51] <duch_kazatel> does exactly the same thing as what you've got.
[14:02:05] <Dr-007> i'm getting an error with $(this)
[14:02:27] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing any errors.
[14:02:45] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis how are you verifying that it's working?
[14:03:36] <hsiisbis> well I'm trying to populate the 'data-featherlight' field with the img src of each .press-item img
[14:03:45] <duch_kazatel> right, how are you verifying that?
[14:03:48] <hsiisbis> shouldn't the script populate the field if it's correct?
[14:03:52] <duch_kazatel> are you using your dev tools and inspecting?
[14:03:53] <Dr-007> ah no, my mistake, $(this) should work.
[14:03:58] <duch_kazatel> because that won't work :)
[14:04:49] <hsiisbis> ah, maybe I'm being stupid - JSFiddle won't update the data field?
[14:04:55] <duch_kazatel> nonono.
[14:05:02] <hsiisbis> hahaha, I'm an idiot
[14:05:04] <duch_kazatel> the data attribute is not updated by .data()
[14:05:16] <duch_kazatel> .data() interacts with a cached version of the data on the element.
[14:05:23] <duch_kazatel> so you won't see it update in your inspector.
[14:05:32] <duch_kazatel> need to console.log it back out.
[14:05:48] <hsiisbis> ah okay, am I going about this the right way then with .data
[14:05:52] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:05:55] <hsiisbis> or do I need another method?
[14:05:57] <hsiisbis> ah cool
[14:05:59] <duch_kazatel> you just can't read it with the inspector.
[14:06:32] <hsiisbis> ah, thanks very much - let me try on a testing page then
[14:06:35] <hsiisbis> many thanks for your help
[14:06:54] <duch_kazatel> sur
[14:06:56] <duch_kazatel> *sure
[14:09:35] <Dr-007> http://jsfiddle.net/wpdeufub/4/
[14:09:54] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr() or .prop() when editing data.
[14:09:55] <duch_kazatel> use .data()
[14:09:56] <Dr-007> i changed a few things. also the .data became .attr
[14:10:01] <duch_kazatel> nonono.
[14:10:07] <Dr-007> ok, so thats what i wanted to ask
[14:10:18] <Dr-007> so you should change thtat back
[14:10:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wpdeufub/5/
[14:10:36] <duch_kazatel> if you need to confirm, use console.log
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> but .data() is the right thing to use.
[14:10:54] <duch_kazatel> it creates/updates a cached copy of that element's data attributes.
[14:11:04] <duch_kazatel> which is what you really want.
[14:12:53] <Dr-007> but why isn't it updated in the browsers DOM anyway? thats what i'd expect with .data()
[14:12:59] <Dr-007> to debug
[14:13:07] <duch_kazatel> because that's slow.
[14:13:10] <duch_kazatel> the DOM is slow slow slow.
[14:13:21] <Dr-007> hmmkay
[14:13:29] <Dr-007> you pointed me to an URL earlier
[14:13:37] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:13:43] <Dr-007> i read that using $.each() is also very slow slow slow
[14:13:50] <Dr-007> on objects or arrays
[14:13:56] <duch_kazatel> can be yes.
[14:13:59] <Dr-007> and should be done via javascript instead
[14:14:07] <duch_kazatel> jquery IS javascript.
[14:14:15] <Dr-007> yeah, but with a for() loop
[14:14:22] <Dr-007> you know, plain javascript
[14:14:25] <duch_kazatel> and 2 things - 1: proper object enumeration is often done wrong.
[14:14:36] <duch_kazatel> 2: speed should never be your first concern when writing JS>
[14:15:00] <Dr-007> well i'm mainly using it because of crossbrowser compatibility
[14:15:03] <duch_kazatel> for loops are semantically bizarre and unusual constructs.
[14:15:37] <Dr-007> since IE6 i've been doing stuff with jquery, but not that often anymore
[14:16:07] <duch_kazatel> if crossbrowser is your concern as far as the base language in concerned, use es5-shim.
[14:18:52] <Dr-007> nah, jquery it is
[14:19:08] <duch_kazatel> fwiw jquery isn't meant to shim the language.
[14:19:15] <duch_kazatel> it's meant to handle crossbrowser DOM issues.
[14:19:40] <Dr-007> i know
[14:19:46] <duch_kazatel> we use es5-shim and jquery here with a lot of success.
[14:20:12] <Dr-007> cool
[14:20:21] <Dr-007> i should get into it more often
[14:20:31] <duch_kazatel> si
[14:21:03] <Dr-007> as i am still trying to fix my problem with the overlay :P
[14:21:10] <Dr-007> god damn drupal
[14:21:15] <Dr-007> with their modules you cant touch
[14:21:21] <duch_kazatel> so what's the exact issue?
[14:22:19] <kevireilly> something that can't be overriden?
[14:22:33] <duch_kazatel> you don
[14:22:43] <duch_kazatel> *don't usually want to edit the actual framework, but meh.
[14:23:15] <kevireilly> right right, that is what drupal's hooks and overrides are for
[14:23:34] <Dr-007> a module thats being used by the theme to generate content via the backend gives you a overlay window generated by jquery UI. in that popup you can add different elements to the layout of your website. one of them is the CKeditor. there are also drupal modules doing providing rich text editors, but they all failed to load the CKeditor properly inside the jquery ui popover ajax loaded content
[14:23:56] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a callback issue.
[14:24:01] <Dr-007> so i thought ill build the stuff myself in jquery. the binding of the newest ckeditor was a walk in the par
[14:24:36] <Dr-007> only when the 'save' button gets pressed inside the jquery ui layover i am getting an error from ckeditor
[14:24:42] <Dr-007> that the ckditor is already loaded
[14:25:05] <Dr-007> so i thought, ill override the save button with my own $().click(); function
[14:25:16] <Dr-007> put in a e.preventDefault or stopPropogation
[14:25:25] <duch_kazatel> might need both fwiw.
[14:25:31] <kevireilly> guessing it isn't telling a lie, but you probably want to override something other than the literal javascript such as the form handler
[14:25:33] <Dr-007> ah
[14:25:35] <Dr-007> let met try that
[14:25:44] <duch_kazatel> is the save button from ckeditor?
[14:25:52] <Dr-007> not he save button from jquery ui
[14:26:09] <duch_kazatel> it should give you a way to do your own handler for that.
[14:26:11] <kevireilly> also note there may still be #drupal and #drupal-support iirc
[14:26:12] <duch_kazatel> but it's been a while.
[14:26:16] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:26:52] <Dr-007> kevireilly, yeah but i know drupal. it jquery / javascript
[14:27:06] <Dr-007> anyway, i will try to add both e.preventdefault
[14:27:11] <kevireilly> and people in there are more likely to know drupal specific jquery / javascript ;)
[14:27:11] <Dr-007> and stoppropogation
[14:27:37] <duch_kazatel> wait were you getting any debugging out of it before with a console lot or anything like that?
[14:27:45] <Dr-007> and i were messing around with events = jQuery._data( b, "events" );
[14:27:50] <duch_kazatel> noooo
[14:27:54] <duch_kazatel> _data is an internal api.
[14:28:04] <Dr-007> yeah, im saving those entries in my own array
[14:28:13] <duch_kazatel> uh
[14:28:14] <Dr-007> then unbind('click')
[14:28:15] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[14:28:21] <Dr-007> and do my own stuff
[14:28:34] <Dr-007> well, im kind of desperate :P
[14:28:43] <hashtag__> hi
[14:28:53] <Dr-007> the page i got events = jQuery._data( b, "events" ); from clearly stated it was an internal pointer
[14:28:55] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 if this is just jqui, try making a fiddle.
[14:28:58] <Dr-007> like youre saying duch_kazatel
[14:29:03] <hashtag__> what got more performance - first checking whether the attribute exists - or just calling removeAttr anyway?
[14:29:06] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you're making things a LOT harder for yourself.
[14:29:17] <duch_kazatel> hashtag__ don't worry about performance until it's an issue.
[14:29:23] <hashtag__> ok!
[14:29:25] <hashtag__> hehe
[14:29:26] <duch_kazatel> premature optimization is evil.
[14:29:42] <Dr-007> i cant fiddle that! i wouldnt know how to simulate those modules inside jsfiddle
[14:30:03] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: Sorry to be a bother again, on my test site the img src outputs to the console but I don't think it's actually populating the data-featherlight field itself: http://cormacmcgloin.com/test/test.html
[14:30:03] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 you don't need to "simulate" anything.  you said you're doingit all yourself, right?
[14:30:14] <hsiisbis> again, sorry if I'm being especially dense
[14:30:29] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis fiddle it up again.
[14:30:58] <hsiisbis> it's basically the fiddle you made actually - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wpdeufub/5/
[14:31:12] <duch_kazatel> so what's it not doing that you want it to do?
[14:31:26] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, no the modules are from the theme. providing all the default logic on the save button. i myself am creating a module/javascript to 'enable' ckeditor on textareas. but i still need to override the default logic on the module i can not alter
[14:31:39] <Dr-007> anyway, i will let you know what i came up with
[14:32:20] <duch_kazatel> '
[14:32:28] <duch_kazatel> *'kay.  you should try a drupal support channel.
[14:33:11] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: basically filling in the 'data-featherlight' field with the img src (if it was populated the secondary button should pop up a lightbox modal with the image)
[14:33:33] <duch_kazatel> right so it sounds like you're confused about how featherlight might work :)
[14:33:37] <duch_kazatel> add it into the fiddle.
[14:34:16] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel:  probably, although I've got it to work by manually entering the data-featherlight' values
[14:34:29] <hsiisbis> one sec, I'll load the plugin intot he fiddle
[14:35:29] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/wpdeufub/6/
[14:36:18] <duch_kazatel> i'm way lost here.  i can't click on anything because of that overlay.
[14:36:35] <Dr-007> lol
[14:36:40] <fluffyKat> hello - can someone recommend jquery code that can do something similar to how the images/text change (on the imac) on this webpage http://www.squarespace.com/home/coverpages/
[14:36:53] <Dr-007> e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); did the trick
[14:36:58] <Dr-007> gosh
[14:37:00] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 figured.
[14:37:16] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: you mean me in terms of the overlay or Dr-007 ?
[14:37:44] <duch_kazatel> the overlay.
[14:38:17] <hsiisbis> in my fiddle or Dr-007's?
[14:38:20] <duch_kazatel> yours.
[14:38:33] <hsiisbis> ah, apologies
[14:38:37] <hsiisbis> I'll remove the overlay then
[14:38:39] <duch_kazatel> either way, you said this works if you edit your html to have the right data attribute value, right?
[14:38:56] <hsiisbis> that's right
[14:39:00] <dplusi_> fluffyKat: try startboostrap.com - not sure exactly what you're looking for - but they have great free examples.
[14:39:17] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis right, because the plugin loads and reads the page as it is - it doesn't update for you when you change things.
[14:39:25] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis so you'll need to manually call the plugin.
[14:39:34] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, have your server output the data correctly in the first place.
[14:40:06] <hsiisbis> ah right, that's where I'm going wrong
[14:40:09] <hsiisbis> fundamental error
[14:40:28] <Dr-007> fluffyKat, its called a paralax website i believe
[14:40:48] <fluffyKat> thanks dplusi_   - im just after some kind of slider. A user click on the arrow and a new image along with text appears
[14:40:56] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: probably best to fill in the field with a php script?
[14:40:59] <duch_kazatel> fluffyKat you want a carousel
[14:41:01] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis yep.
[14:41:13] <duch_kazatel> hsiisbis your backend should handle that kind of work. not js.
[14:41:13] <hsiisbis> duch_kazatel: sorry for wasting your time
[14:41:16] <hsiisbis> much appreciated
[14:41:22] <duch_kazatel> not a waste at all :)
[14:41:27] <duch_kazatel> you learned something :D
[14:41:34] <hsiisbis> that's true :)
[14:42:52] <fluffyKat> did some googling and im spoiled for choice...so many plugins not sure which to choose
[14:43:00] <duch_kazatel> fluffyKat for a carousel?
[14:43:16] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:43:29] <duch_kazatel> that being said, pick any of 'em.  they're all about the same.
[14:44:20] <fluffyKat> I guess...basically i want to show a website example on the left and right of it a description of the site. When the user scrolls down the page doesnt scroll down but the webpage changes along with the accompanying text
[14:45:03] <duch_kazatel> so you want some kind of parallax effect.
[14:45:14] <fluffyKat> yeah
[14:45:32] <fluffyKat> I prefer scrolling effect to a user clicking
[14:45:46] <fluffyKat> forces the user to see the example pages
[14:46:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a really annoying setup fwiw.
[14:46:27] <duch_kazatel> what plugin does that page use?
[14:46:28] <fluffyKat> i was inspired by this page..is perfect http://www.squarespace.com/home/coverpages/
[14:46:49] <duch_kazatel> i saw.
[14:47:03] <fluffyKat> no idea
[14:47:29] <decx> how does squarespace get away with not using transform
[14:47:42] <decx> the nerd shaming must be real for the devs at startup partys
[14:47:45] <duch_kazatel> by being squarespace and building invasive stuff.
[18:38:39] <stephane> hello
[18:43:35] <coldhead> hi
[19:52:59] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm doing this on my Ajax-request-result: $(result).find('table.resultTable'). But I don't get the table
[19:53:07] <JosefDe> $(result) is just plain HTML
[19:54:36] <Woet> JosefDe: www.jsfiddle.net
[19:54:43] <JosefDe> ok
[19:54:52] <Woet> a /working/ demo please
[19:54:57] <coldhead> is it possible that your table is the only thing in result? find() will only look at descendants, not the parent
[20:03:41] <lwerrs> line 21 https://github.com/mking/react-hn/blob/master/js/app.js, can someone explain why there is a _() before using .map?
[20:03:54] <lwerrs> i don't understand why it's needed..
[20:04:41] <Max-P> lwerrs: That's the underscore library
[20:04:57] <Max-P> http://underscorejs.org/
[20:05:40] <happyKatt> var _ = require('lodash');
[20:05:47] <JosefDe> coldhead: The strange thing is that that jquery-Code is working on one page but not in the other
[20:06:03] <JosefDe> coldhead: If I try filter() instead, it also returns no result
[20:06:09] <Max-P> Ah, didn't see that. So it's lodash then, same thing different implementation
[20:07:02] <lwerrs> i tried to understaned it, https://lodash.com/docs#_, but I don't, what would go wrong without using _()?
[20:08:22] <JosefDe> But the strange thing is this:
[20:08:35] <JosefDe> If I put the AJAX response into a div and apply find on tihs div, it works
[20:08:35] <happyKatt> try it w/out _() and see what happens
[20:08:56] <lwerrs> what does this mean: Creates a lodash object which wraps value to enable implicit chaining.
[20:09:19] <JosefDe> Has anyone an idea what the reason for this could be?
[20:09:30] <acidjazz> anyone here use an iphone 6s
[20:10:06] <happyKatt> _ is the variable that holds the lodash object
[20:10:32] <happyKatt> then you use your dot notation to access whatever is in lodash
[20:10:46] <happyKatt> i'm guessing because I've never used it!!!!!
[20:10:49] <happyKatt> ;p
[20:12:11] <JosefDe> ?
[20:17:50] <JosefDe> Does anyone know the reason for my problem?
[20:18:12] <lwerrs> oh, I guess the author just prefers lodash map to native map.. can't see any other reason
[20:20:49] <lwerrs> man javascript can be hard to learn when there sso many ways to do the same thing
[20:22:46] <acidjazz> JosefDe: i would say its personal
[20:22:55] <JosefDe> personal?
[20:24:41] <lwerrs> are you sure you are referncing ajax afters its loaded?
[21:02:46] <dopieee> hey all
[22:40:29] <MACscr> any ideas what im missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/egdk1ua5/8/. Not sure why its not grabbing the content of the div on line 3.
[22:40:48] <MACscr> when i click on preview
[22:44:41] <coldhead> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/egdk1ua5/9/
[22:44:51] <coldhead> your selector was wrong
[22:45:06] <MACscr> ha, just figured that out when you stated that
[22:45:11] <MACscr> er, second before. thanks
[22:50:12] <Bonezone> ...so Im a noob. How do you call a php function using jquery/ajax
[22:50:24] <Bonezone> like in an html file
[22:50:39] <MACscr> Bonezone: you dont
[22:50:51] <MACscr> you do a GET request on a php file to load content from it
[22:51:00] <Bonezone> okay. well my goal here is to get data from a mysql server and display it on the webpage
[22:51:07] <MACscr> and then do whatever you want with it with javascript
[22:51:21] <MACscr> tons of tutorials for that
[22:51:30] <Bonezone> I cant really find any honestly, ive been looking around for a while
[22:51:48] <MACscr> http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp
[22:52:00] <Bonezone> ahhh thank you
[22:52:09] <Bonezone> I honestly dont know why my google search DIDNT bring up that page
[22:52:16] <Bonezone> this looks like what i want
[22:52:19] <MACscr> i just googled for "jquery get data from mysql database"
[22:52:29] <MACscr> tons of tutorials
[22:52:39] <coldhead> great work everyone
[22:52:42] <Bonezone> I swear I googled that and didnt see it, maybe i just overlooked it
[22:52:50] <MACscr> first result
[22:53:05] <Bonezone> welp, didnt see it anywhere lol
[22:54:44] <Bonezone> this also isnt using jquery though. I mean which isn't a problem really
[22:55:19] <MACscr> just google what i googled for. tons of reqults
[22:55:23] <MACscr> results
[22:57:58] <MACscr> I have a two questions that are hopefully as easy as my last one. =P
[22:58:00] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/vfvozj8k/118/
[22:58:38] <MACscr> 1) when i click on preview, it shows the html markup in the modal instead of just displaying the output. Why is that?
[22:59:40] <MACscr> 2) How can i get that preview button to actually work with newer content added to the editor? Just seems to only present content that was initially in the textarea when the page was loaded
[23:01:50] <MACscr> rofl
[23:01:57] <MACscr> already solved. Glad i asked again =P
[23:02:16] <coldhead> >: |
[23:02:48] <MACscr> played with it for 10 mins, couldnt figureout. Asked, figured it out in 30 seconds. lol
[23:06:06] <MACscr> nvm, guess i had the wrong jquery loaded (older one) and i cant use live() anymore
[23:06:58] <MACscr> on() definitely isnt as straightforward
[23:08:12] <MACscr> im open to suggestions http://jsfiddle.net/vfvozj8k/119/
[23:09:19] <MACscr> lol, bind() does it
[23:09:28] <MACscr> lol, asking worked again. im on a roll =P
[23:10:33] <coldhead> unsubscribe
[23:10:43] <MACscr> ha. sorry
[23:13:02] <Uhkis> MACscr: http://duckie.me/
[23:16:24] <MACscr> ok, you know how some email clients will convert an email address in the TO or BCC fields, etc, to a single element with an X symbol in order to remove it? Any suggestions/ideas for doing this in a form field?
[23:16:47] <MACscr> i might just do a simple comma separated list, but thought this might be cool instead
[23:23:30] <MACscr> duckie found it for me. i will make sure i ask him next time first. my bad
[23:23:46] <Uhkis> :)
[23:23:55] <Uhkis> he's pretty good at debugging for a duck!
[23:28:51] <dimi1947> I have this markup and by clicking the del icon I want to target the id="profile_0"and from it only the zero...what do you suggest?
[23:29:46] <dimi1947> furthermore I think maybe it is better to have class="0" instead of the id you see
[23:47:00] <Cork> dimi1947: data-number="0"
[23:47:12] <Cork> you shouldn't store data in id or class
[23:47:33] <Cork> they should only be used for accessing and styling the element
