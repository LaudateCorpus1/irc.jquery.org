[04:15:28] <BrainWork> hi, how come jquery ui hasnt been updated since 2016? i'm concerned because i chose it for my webapp a year ago, and now i cant get any updates that fix an issue
[04:15:56] <BrainWork> basically im using it with bootstrap modal, and when i show some modals on mobile safari, the dialog doesnt appear, just the modal backdrop
[04:16:18] <BrainWork> ive tried all kinds of fixes regarding the z-index of various things
[04:16:22] <BrainWork> it just wont show :(
[04:16:45] <Cork> BrainWork: bootstrap has nothing to do with jquery; so if you have problem with there modal you would have to talk with them
[04:16:52] <Woet> their *
[04:34:23] <BrainWork> the modal is part of jquery-ui
[04:34:26] <BrainWork> iirc
[04:57:01] <Cork> BrainWork: so you mean dialog not modal?
[04:57:17] <Cork> cause jquery doesn't have a method called modal (only a setting in dialog)
[05:00:25] <BrainWork> Cork: i found and fixed the bug. kinda.
[05:00:27] <BrainWork> it was a bug in jquery-ui
[05:00:48] <BrainWork> im not sure why, but if i set a div as moveable, it does not render
[05:01:01] <BrainWork> if i take the moveable attribute off the div, it appears
[05:01:19] <Cork> you haven't specified waht it would be yet, as you talk about modals and those are bootstrap, not jquery-ui
[05:01:48] <BrainWork> so, i put some code in my webapp to detect mobile safari and take off the moveable attribute as a workaround, its not needed on that OS anyway as the screen isnt practically big enough to drag the dialog about, even on a retina ipad
[05:01:59] <BrainWork> its a combination, cork
[05:02:14] <BrainWork> theres a bootstrap modal, which has jquery-ui drag and drop attributes
[05:02:28] <BrainWork> i think thats why we were all getting confused, you with my description, and me with the bug
[05:02:38] <Cork> ... then you should have started there
[05:02:54] <BrainWork> yeah probably. ive not really touched that code for 2 years and had forgotten how it worked myself
[05:03:14] <BrainWork> i was sure it was just jquery that made that bit do its magic
[05:03:36] <Cork> and you're sure drag and drop is what is causing the hiding of the element?
[05:03:41] <BrainWork> yes
[05:03:49] <Cork> cause?
[05:03:55] <BrainWork> i think its a conflict with bootstrap modal and ios safari
[05:04:24] <Cork> ya, so you should prob start by talking with them, as they are the major codebase of what your doing
[05:04:54] <BrainWork> it only happens in safari on ios, and only happens if the drag and drop attributes are added to a div that isnt directly within the document body
[05:04:54] <Cork> drag and drop is a farily small plugin in jquery, a full dialog (modal as bootstrap calls it) is a lot more code
[05:05:05] <BrainWork> im quite happy to blame ios tbh, i dont like that platform anyway.
[05:05:33] <Cork> BrainWork: the point is you have to reduce the problem space
[05:05:39] <BrainWork> (sorry i meant directly in the document body)
[05:06:31] <BrainWork> i'll see if i can trim down the issue to something simpler later for a paste snippet
[05:07:08] <Cork> also go and file a bug in the jquery-ui draggable bugtracker IF you can prove it is there code actaully breaking it (and i doubt it actauly is)
[05:07:45] <BrainWork> its such a complex system that i doubt i can duplicate it without the interaction of all three, ios, bootstrap and jqui
[05:07:53] <BrainWork> we'll see
[05:08:27] <BrainWork> i never had any issue with draggable objects in jqui before without using bootstrap alongside it, and ive been using jqui for about 8 years or so? at a guess
[05:09:08] <BrainWork> and ive done some crazy stuff with it before without issue, as you say its pretty simple and stable
[05:09:56] <Cork> what the plugin is fairly straight forward ya
[05:10:14] <Cork> especially when you talk about element not rendering
[05:10:22] <Cork> cause it does almost nothing in that space
[08:28:35] <petzup> https://jsfiddle.net/g5n78g8y/9/
[08:29:08] <petzup> how would i make kepress so it would work in way that i can easily insert time like 02:30
[09:47:50] <foo> I have a 2.5 hour long mp3 of someone speaking. I want a simple way to distribute this to someone. Right now we serve files via X-Accel-Redirect, and set Content-Type and Content-Length. If the person refreshes the page, they lose where they were at in the voice note. Is there a way to return the user back to where they las were, with flask? eg. pass the bytes range last served, maybe store it in a databash with sha hash of IP + user agent or such? I know ...
[09:47:56] <foo> ... I can do a custom jquery / html5 player... looking at my alternatives before I go that route. If I could do bookmarks every 30 minutes or such that would work (as opposd to breaking the mp3 up in 30 min chunks)
[10:16:24] <IamTrying> Since Chrome 71. Getting this error https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/g8XdjvrttQ/

[10:50:40] <amikrop> I am showing a "loading" screen like this http://dpaste.com/232PHXB but I want to add some text under it. Though, I want the whole image + text block to be centered. How do I do that?
[10:51:23] <amikrop> That means I want the image to appear a bit more up than this code suggests, plus add some text beneath it, so the whole thing looks centered (vertically and horizontally).
[11:00:06] <shoky> IamTrying: is this relevant perhaps?  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL#Using_object_URLs_for_media_streams
[11:02:43] <shoky> IamTrying: yeah you're passing a stream, seems relevant.  and here is how to deal with it for keeping backwards compatibilty:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject#Supporting_fallback_to_the_src_property
[11:06:02] <shoky> aaand they're gone :|
[12:08:44] <vzlahagen> hello guys.. i was wondering what something like this means .. !!$('#id-selector')
[12:09:00] <vzlahagen> so far it always returns true.. it doesn't matter if the element exists or not
[12:09:58] <vzlahagen> jquery 1.10.2
[12:16:09] <shoky> vzlahagen: with jquery that will indeed always be true (unless there's something after it maybe..)
[12:30:01] <foo> uh, what is haml? https://codepen.io/kindofone/pen/DkhAz
[12:30:02] * foo mindblown
[13:20:19] <vzlahagen> thanks @shoky
[14:12:49] <c_bluntish> hey
[14:13:13] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[14:16:40] <c_bluntish> hey, why can I say $('.man_user').on('click',function(){$(this).attr("uid","999");}); and this works great but if I use a function eg $('.man_user').on('click',function(){somefunk();}); ... function somefunk(){$(this).attr("uid","999");} this doest not work, its like $(this) is out of scope?
[14:20:12] <robertmaxrees> you're bnasically juggling context.
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> the right way is to do $('.man_user').on('click', somefunk);
[14:20:37] <robertmaxrees> instead of having an intermediary function just to call a function.
[14:43:20] <c_bluntish> sorry
[14:43:29] <c_bluntish> I didnt explain my question properly robertmaxrees
[14:44:22] <c_bluntish> I just needed to call somefunk($(this)) then in somefunk(that) {} that = this in previous scope .... worked np
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:44:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> don't do that = this.
[14:45:13] <robertmaxrees> either get the specific data you need or use .call(this)
[15:32:33] <foo> Can someone confirm my understanding... if I pass an mp3 file to a user, it will play automatically. But if I put that same mp3 in an <audio>, I cannot get it to play automatically. Correct?
[15:58:17] <robertmaxrees> depends all around.
[16:22:20] <foo> RonaldsMazitis: I get the sense some browsers allow autoplay some don't
[16:22:44] <Gh0st_Preacher> ^ sort of.
[16:23:13] <robertmaxrees> chrome has some weirdo per-domain algo it uses to figure out if it should autoplay videos and audio
[16:29:45] <gambl0r3> hello?
[16:33:16] <gambl0r3> does a list item key have to be a integer value?
[16:33:41] <robertmaxrees> "a list item key"?
[16:33:49] <gambl0r3> robertmaxrees, hey hows going?
[16:33:53] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying what you're talking about?
[16:33:55] <gambl0r3> its been a while
[16:34:17] <robertmaxrees> do you mean an array index?
[16:34:35] <gambl0r3> no
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> then what are you referring to?
[16:35:34] <gambl0r3> hey, did you receive my pm?
[16:35:44] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:35:48] <robertmaxrees> so what are you referring to?
[16:35:54] <gambl0r3> the list item
[16:36:01] <robertmaxrees> what is a "list item"?
[16:36:06] <gambl0r3> ye
[16:36:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not a yes or not question.
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> *no
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> can you show a fiddle with some relevant code?
[16:38:14] <robertmaxrees> gambl0r3 dunno why you keep pming me lol
[16:38:37] <gambl0r3> cause you're ignoring me
[16:38:44] <gambl0r3> but whatever
[16:38:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:38:55] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:39:01] <robertmaxrees> so can you show some sample code or whatever?
