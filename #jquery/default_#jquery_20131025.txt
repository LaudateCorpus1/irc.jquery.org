[00:00:07] <nardev> but really thank you Cork  :(
[00:00:20] <Cork> nardev: well the last one is what you described
[00:00:26] <Cork> unnu: http://api.jqueryui.com/selectable/#option-filter
[00:00:27] <anli> Is there a keyboard shortcut for entering 3d view?
[00:00:36] <anli> I need to see live which element that is above another
[00:00:44] <anli> Without moving the mouse
[00:01:00] <nardev> Cork, imagine that in one .question has only one :radio  THAN it must fail!
[00:01:45] <Cork> nardev: well look at the code i gave you, it should give you the starting block
[00:01:49] <Cork> it isn't hard logic
[00:02:46] <nardev> Cork, basically in one sentence: I must be sure that there is in each .box div at least one div .question and that in each .question block there is at least 2 radio buttons
[00:04:13] <unnu> Cork, highlight when your free . . . i might need some srs help with this
[00:04:18] <unnu> if you dont mind :D
[00:06:18] <Cork> anli: shift+f2 "tilt open"
[00:06:36] <anli> oh
[00:06:39] <anli> thanks
[00:07:22] <Cork> the dev bar is quite nice if you want to use the keyboard
[00:11:17] <unnu> GAHHHH
[00:11:22] <unnu> imma stab jquery
[00:11:23] <unnu> in the face
[00:11:25] <unnu> twice
[00:11:31] <unnu> with a constructor
[00:11:49] <unnu> __constructor    >>>>    [jQuery Face]
[00:13:55] <unnu> anyone know an easy way to select an image?
[00:16:25] <anli> Cork: shift-f2 had no effect, do I need to have the inspection panel open?
[00:16:45] <anli> It opened the console for me
[00:35:48] <TNG_25> hi,
[00:35:59] <TNG_25> anyone can assist me with jquery code i make ?
[00:40:53] <unnu> http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/12 anyone know why im not getting the img source in the console on click?
[00:51:36] <Cork> ?api closest @ unnu
[00:51:36] <b-ot> unnu: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:51:49] <Cork> "progressing up through the DOM"
[00:51:56] <Cork> ?ask @ TNG_25
[00:51:56] <b-ot> TNG_25: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:52:17] <unnu> i get undefined cork
[00:52:38] <TNG_25> sorry before,
[00:52:39] <Cork> unnu: check the ref i gave you
[00:52:47] <unnu> kay
[00:52:59] <Cork> unnu: specifically the "beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree."
[00:53:18] <Cork> you can find the img CHILD if you check through the PARENT list
[00:55:15] <anli> I need to disable mouse events and then inspect an element, is that possible?
[00:55:27] <TNG_25> actually im making a dialog widget jquery with tutorial on api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[00:55:48] <Cork> anli: no
[00:55:56] <anli> hm, tabbing to another window maybe
[00:56:16] <TNG_25> seems i cant theming the dialog, i wonder how to css that
[00:57:10] <unnu> cork, its the images thats giving me the most headaches :(
[00:57:15] <Cork> TNG_25: theme what?
[00:57:44] <Cork> unnu: did you understand the commend about the browser selector you use?
[00:57:50] <Cork> *broken
[00:58:01] <TNG_25> Cork: like changing the background-color of dialog
[00:58:18] <unnu>  commend?
[00:58:22] <TNG_25> or another css styling.
[00:58:27] <Cork> unnu: comment
[00:58:36] <Cork> TNG_25: just check the default theme
[00:58:41] <Cork> and then change what you want
[00:59:01] <Cork> TNG_25: if you want to add a specific exception for any widget
[00:59:11] <Cork> just inspect the dom and grab the class you need
[01:00:50] <unnu> is it the fact that it travels up the dom, and the img is a child of the div?
[01:00:57] <Cork> yes
[01:01:06] <anli> If I popup a context menu in chrome, not closing it, I can move the mouse without generating mouse events, but not in firefox
[01:01:06] * unnu facepalms
[01:01:09] <Cork> you want .find() not .closest
[01:01:18] * unnu is learning 
[01:01:22] <TNG_25> Cork: i dont get it,
[01:01:24] <unnu> :) thanks cork
[01:01:39] <Cork> TNG_25: what part don't you get?
[01:01:50] <unnu> also, bravo on making me read that whole thing 3 times before i caught on to the stupid mistake
[01:02:11] <Cork> unnu: well i did mention the exact cause two times in here
[01:02:23] <unnu> yeah
[01:02:32] <unnu> was hung up on the fact that it was an image
[01:02:34] <TNG_25> Cork: how to check the default theme?
[01:02:40] <unnu> was reading all about the :image psudeo for input
[01:02:49] <Cork> TNG_25: download it and look through the .css file
[01:02:50] <unnu> read the line you pointed out once
[01:02:55] <unnu> :(
[01:02:59] <unnu> its late?
[01:03:01] <unnu> lol
[01:03:02] <Cork> TNG_25: there is a core one that only holds the rules needed for ui to work
[01:03:17] <Cork> TNG_25: and then it's the theme part, and that one you can use as a base
[01:03:38] <Cork> unnu: well don't blame the tool so easily :)
[01:04:03] <unnu> its not php
[01:04:10] <Cork> <_<
[01:04:14] <Cork> ya?
[01:04:16] <unnu> ive lived in my php saftey bubble for too long?
[01:04:20] <Cork> ya
[01:04:24] <unnu> learning a new language is kinda scary
[01:04:28] <unnu> and when im ignorant and afraid
[01:04:30] <Cork> not really
[01:04:31] <unnu> i lash out
[01:04:35] <Cork> done it my hole life
[01:04:36] <unnu> and blame everyone but myself
[01:05:09] <unnu> WELL WE CANT ALL BE 1337 LIKE YOU CORK . . . .  <3 lol
[01:05:31] <Cork> unnu: basically default to "it doesn't work", "what am i doing wrong"
[01:05:40] <TNG_25> Cork: you mean the UI Core?
[01:05:50] <Cork> not "it doesn't work" "what's wrong with this tool"
[01:06:08] <Cork> TNG_25: no that one is the ruls needed for the jquery-ui to work
[01:06:13] <Cork> TNG_25: there is a theme set too
[01:06:41] <TNG_25> Cork: Still i still wonder whats the meaning of ui-dialog-content and other else in theming on http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[01:07:04] <Cork> TNG_25: have you looked through the theme css files?
[01:07:35] <TNG_25> Cork: To be honest, i cant looked through of it
[01:07:48] <Cork> can't or haven't?
[01:07:49] <TNG_25> Cork: i dont know where to look, lols
[01:08:11] <Cork> TNG_25: well use the theme builder or the default gray theme
[01:08:35] <Cork> TNG_25: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[01:09:25] <Cork> TNG_25: or http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/cupertino/jquery-ui.css
[01:11:09] <TNG_25> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[01:11:20] <TNG_25> lols my mistakes i didnt see that
[01:11:41] <unnu> str = str.replace(/it doesn't work/g, 'what am i doing wrong?');
[01:11:45] <unnu> lol
[01:11:56] <unnu> brb, smoke
[01:11:56] <TNG_25> Cork: its okay if i download that and change it on my own ?
[01:12:04] <Cork> TNG_25: yes
[01:12:27] <TNG_25> cool, thanks for your assists :)
[01:13:43] <janis33> i'm new to jquery ui slider.. i post on the forum but didn't get any respons.. is there somebody that wanna check what this newbie does wrong by simple using $('.slider').slider().....
[01:13:57] <Cork> ?ask
[01:13:57] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:17:16] <janis33> http://www.voerstreekvakantie.nl/joomla/en/item/191-dodge-ram-laramie-zwart-d6308.html  in the middle of the page there is the slider.... but when you slide.. it hide it self..  there are two things that are happing that i don't understand.. 1. it wrap it in a new parent div    .....2. .ui-silder  get inlinestyle = margin-top  and it change it when sliding .. don't know what i'm doing wrong..
[01:17:54] <diverdude> any good recommendations for a local html and css validator?
[01:19:14] <Cork> janis33: you modify the height of the parent div for some reason
[01:19:53] <Cork> janis33: where do you have the code for your slider?
[01:20:07] <Cork> diverdude: basically there isn't one as far as i know
[01:20:28] <diverdude> Cork, ok...how do you usually validate?
[01:20:29] <Cork> there are tools for editors that catch the basic errors (unclosed tags)
[01:20:34] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[01:20:34] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service â†’ http://validator.w3.org/
[01:21:06] <janis33> cork: this is the code
[01:21:08] <janis33>  <script>       	             jQuery( ".slider" ).slider({ 			    animate: true,                 range: "min",                 value: 50,                 min: 10,                 max: 100, 				step: 10,                  				//this gets a live reading of the value and prints it on the page                 slide: function( event, ui ) {                     jQuery( "#slider-result" ).html( ui.value );                 },  				//this up
[01:21:42] <janis33> the hidden form field so we can submit the data using a form                 change: function(event, ui) {                  jQuery('#hidden').attr('value', ui.value);                 } 			 				});         </script>
[01:21:59] <Cork> ?p
[01:22:11] <Cork> janis33: please don't dump code in the channel
[01:22:30] <Cork> use one jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com, or similar
[01:22:44] <spygame> does anyone know how can i disable dates and times in this jquery datepicker with time plugin http://mugifly.github.io/jquery-simple-datetimepicker/
[01:23:03] <janis33> cork: you asked for the code that's why i past it :)
[01:23:17] <Cork> janis33: not in the channel
[01:23:26] <Cork> noone can read the mash anyway
[01:23:32] <janis33> cork: in the pm?
[01:23:39] <Cork> use one jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com, or similar <--
[01:23:41] <unnu> jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com, codepad.org,
[01:23:56] <Cork> heck for this even pastebin is ok
[01:24:15] <Cork> though normally if you want to make an example of the problem it would make things easier
[01:24:28] <Cork> (and you would most likely find your own error)
[01:25:05] <janis33> cork: http://pastebin.com/ekDmWBRJ
[01:25:39] <Cork> janis33: no the problem is something outside that
[01:26:07] <janis33> cork: outside?...
[01:26:15] <Cork> something in your site
[01:26:51] <janis33> cork: the problem is something outside the website??
[01:27:29] <Eknath> hi
[01:28:22] <Cork> janis33: no the problem is some other code you have on the website
[01:28:56] <Cork> janis33: if you don't know what it is i suggest you start ripping parts out until you find what does it
[01:29:04] <janis33> cork:i traid to find it with firebug jquery plugin.. but i couldn't find it..
[01:29:05] <janis33> oke
[01:29:12] <Eknath> hi this is eknath from Mumbai
[01:29:19] <Cork> janis33: it is hard to find it as it most likely is event based
[01:29:57] <Cork> janis33: but the slider-ui element has a div you added
[01:30:09] <Cork> janis33: and this div gets its height changed as you drag the slider
[01:30:18] <Cork> janis33: somewhere you are doing this
[01:32:04] <janis33> Cork:  oke.. but it's trange.. when you load the page it's like it should be.. but when you are going to slide.. it wrap it zelf in een new parent div..  i'm very sure i don't use the wrap function at all in the hole page
[01:37:46] <Cork> janis33: try removing mootools temporarely
[01:37:55] <Cork> might be the cause
[01:38:34] <janis33> Cork: let me check how to do that.. that's hard one to remove.. it's automatic addin..
[01:39:15] <unnu> hey cork, im having trouble finding element
[01:39:15] <DarsVaeda> according to the docu froms can submitted by input type="submit", input type="image" and button type="submit"
[01:39:38] <DarsVaeda> but for me it works for every button too, which is what I want, is this a bug or expected behavior?
[01:39:49] <unnu> i need a the clicked element's parent's children with a specific class
[01:39:59] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it's buttons where type is not "button"
[01:39:59] <unnu> that made no sense
[01:40:02] <unnu> nvm
[01:40:05] <Cork> DarsVaeda: submit is the default
[01:40:25] <DarsVaeda> ahh I see, can I get which button was clicked?
[01:40:32] <Cork> DarsVaeda: well button and reset :)
[01:40:43] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not from the submit event no
[01:40:52] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks
[01:40:55] <Cork> it is a shortcoming in most browsers
[01:41:11] <Cork> (gecko exposes it, but they are the only one)
[01:41:40] <DarsVaeda> for that I would have to do "button.on('click'... from.submit()" right?
[01:41:47] <Cork> no
[01:41:57] <Cork> just add a click handler on the button, and set a variable
[01:42:05] <Cork> and then check that variable in the submit event
[01:42:18] <Cork> remember to have an else case for when enter was used
[01:42:38] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay
[01:43:59] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you could do something like: $('form').on('click'. 'button, input[type="submit"], input[type="image"]', function() { $(this).closest('form').data('button', this); })
[01:44:11] <Cork> and then just check $(this).data('button') in the submit event
[01:48:53] <DarsVaeda> works quite well, many thanks :)
[01:50:37] <unnu> how hard would it be to make a div slide down under the buttons on my modal dialog when i click upload with a file input? http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/18
[01:50:56] <janis33> cork: you are right the problem is with mootools.. what can i do that jquery ui slider can work with mootools?
[01:51:13] <Cork> ?api jquery.noconflict
[01:51:13] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.noConflict(): Relinquish jQuery's control of the <code>$</code> variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[01:51:28] <Cork> janis33: that MIGHT work
[01:51:33] <Cork> if it doesn't tough luck
[01:52:37] <janis33> Cork: it seems problem with the mootools libery but what can i do that it will work with jquery ui slider?...
[01:53:47] <Cork> janis33: if mootools does it without you triggering it, then you can't really
[01:53:56] <Cork> except stop using one of the libs
[01:54:10] <Cork> (though you shouldn't mix frameworks it tends to be bad)
[01:54:47] <DieguezZ> hi, can somebody tell me, why the accordion inside the toggle is going so slow? here the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ffMPK/ and here the website. http://goo.gl/CHQc3T
[01:54:50] <SuperHans> j
[02:00:26] <unnu> can you not use .attr() with an input?
[02:00:35] <unnu> thats agrivating if so
[02:02:06] <Cork> unnu: no it should work just fine
[02:02:19] <Cork> though you might not want attr
[02:02:24] <Cork> it depends on what you want to do
[02:03:18] <unnu> hrmm
[02:03:43] <unnu> there might not be a way
[02:03:45] <unnu> but
[02:03:46] <unnu> http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/19
[02:03:52] <unnu> when you click on the 100x100 image
[02:03:57] <unnu> it pops up with the modal
[02:04:14] <unnu> when you click "upload a new image" i want the <input> to be under the buttons
[02:04:39] <unnu> with maybe a <hr> dividing them
[02:04:47] <unnu> any EASY way to do that?
[02:05:45] <TNG_25> Cork: hey, do you know how to make that dialog closed on single click ?
[02:06:42] <Cork> unnu: http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/20/edit
[02:07:10] <unnu> YOUR THE MAN CORK
[02:13:33] <unnu> now this one is a hard one cork, is there a event for when a file has been selected via input?
[02:13:38] <unnu> i can't find anyting on google
[02:14:04] <Cork> unnu: no there isn't
[02:14:17] <Cork> hmm
[02:14:21] <Cork> well there is the change event
[02:14:33] <unnu> okay
[02:14:35] <Cork> if you go that route you will have to fiddle with the file api though
[02:14:46] <Cork> and that has limited browser support
[02:14:53] <unnu> pffft
[02:15:03] <Cork> simplest might be to do an upload of the image through an iframe
[02:15:21] <Cork> that way you don't have to fiddle so much with things to get it working
[02:15:56] <unnu> can i not go $('input parent').on('change', 'input', function() { do stuff});
[02:16:52] <unnu> actually, let me try that
[02:17:03] <Cork> sure
[02:17:05] <unnu> i doubt it will work
[02:17:08] <unnu> but WTH
[02:17:08] <unnu> lol
[02:17:10] <Cork> but you can't access the image that way
[02:17:14] <unnu> no?
[02:17:16] <unnu> how then?
[02:17:20] <unnu> better yet
[02:17:22] <unnu> to the google
[02:17:23] <Cork> ?mdn file api
[02:17:23] <b-ot> Cork: File - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File
[02:17:39] <Cork> or like i said go the simple route and upload the image to the server
[02:17:56] <unnu> i just need to know when the user has selected a file
[02:17:58] <unnu> :(
[02:18:20] <unnu> and not canceled out, left it blank or something like that
[02:18:20] <ph88> where in the jquery 2.0.2 is the actual xhr request being send off ?
[02:18:35] <unnu> i can fumble through the file upload
[02:18:46] <ph88> transport.send( requestHeaders, done );   ?
[02:20:16] <Cork> ph8: search for XMLHttpRequest
[02:20:25] <Cork> or .send
[02:20:31] <ph88> oki
[02:22:35] <ph88> jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr = function() { 	try { 		return new XMLHttpRequest(); 	} catch( e ) {} };
[02:22:58] <Cork> that one creates the xhr native object
[02:24:12] <Cork> ph88: xhr.send( options.hasContent && options.data || null );
[02:24:49] <ph88> ok great i'm gonna put a debug point there
[03:00:26] <janis33> cork:  i found a solution with out removing motools.. i post it on the forum .. when i put this before the jquery it works  jQuery('div.slider')[0].slide = null;  so you know ;)
[03:00:47] <Cork> heh
[03:00:54] <Cork> janis33: good for you!
[03:02:38] <ph88> this callback crashed on IE 10 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js#L71-L101  i don't know how to debug it ... because the debugger won't let me step through the callback code
[03:02:56] <ph88> Error:   Object doesn't support this property or method
[03:04:50] <Cork> ph88: put a breakpoint in the callback function just before it
[03:04:59] <ph88> which line ?
[03:05:21] <ph88> 73 ?
[03:05:50] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have this code:           $("#results input[type=checkbox]").each(function () {
[03:06:10] <jarr0dsz> but i would like to match if this input field has a certain classname also how would one do that?
[03:06:21] <ph88> $('#results input[type="checkbox"]').each(function () {
[03:06:23] <Cork> ph88: line 72 or 73 ya
[03:06:26] <Cork> both are interesting
[03:06:29] <ph88> oki Cork
[03:06:56] <Cork> jarr0dsz: $('#results input[type="checkbox"].class-name-goes-here')
[03:07:08] <jarr0dsz> ah cool just like that simple thank you Cork
[03:07:17] <Cork> jarr0dsz: it is normal css selectors
[03:07:51] <Cork> ph88: is this ajax post?
[03:07:56] <ph88> PATCH
[03:08:06] <Cork> same thing
[03:08:16] <Cork> looks like there is quite a few having problems with those in ie10
[03:08:56] <Cork> the workarounds i've found is a bit nasty though...

[03:09:00] <ph88> i use it together with backbone.js  ...  and in other parts of my app it works okay
[03:09:13] <ph88> that's all ? a meta tag ?
[03:09:18] <Cork> ya
[03:09:27] <ph88> ok let me try that straight away ^^
[03:09:29] <Cork> triggers ie to run in ie9 mode
[03:09:54] <Cork> though that said, i've never had any problems with ie10
[03:10:17] <unnu> if i return html via ajax whats the best way to insert it in the dom? .html() doesn't seem to do it
[03:10:29] <seutje> I had, with svg
[03:10:48] <Cork> seutje: i meant with ajax
[03:11:01] <Cork> unnu: depends on if you want to replace or add
[03:11:07] <unnu> replace
[03:11:11] <Cork> then ya
[03:11:20] <Corrado> anyone use infinity.js ?
[03:12:02] <ph88> that didn't help :|
[03:12:08] <unnu> Cork, im just having the php echo the HTML right now . . . seemed easiest
[03:12:36] <Cork> ph88: well it's a step forward i guess
[03:13:04] <Cork> wonder if it is onload that ie10 complains about or something in callback()
[03:13:32] <seutje> Cork, ph88: this might be related: http://cypressnorth.com/programming/internet-explorer-aborting-ajax-requests-fixed/
[03:13:33] <unnu> Cork, replaceWith()?
[03:13:51] <Cork> unnu: if you want to replace the container, ya
[03:13:54] <seutje> no wait, I'm a moron :D
[03:14:05] <Cork> though that would make it hard to do it again though
[03:14:45] <Cork> freeky...
[03:15:11] <ph88> ok i'm now at line 72 ... now sure what i should see here ...
[03:15:30] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/OpavEqu/1
[03:15:56] <Cork> ph88: well step forwards is it the actual call to callback() that fails
[03:16:17] <Cork> or is it just that ie miss calls the line to the onload cause it has the function ref
[03:16:26] <Cork> (if so the error happens after line 73)
[03:16:28] <ph88> i use step into, now it's at line 99
[03:16:41] <Cork> ph88: ya, excpected
[03:16:56] <Cork> if you can step forward from there to > 101 then it is the callback
[03:17:09] <Cork> put a breakpoint on line 73 and let it run
[03:17:12] <ph88> then i step forward again and im on line 101
[03:17:17] <Cork> and again?
[03:17:20] <Cork> no error?
[03:17:34] <ph88> after that step into and it's an error
[03:18:03] <Cork> ph88: is the error on the onload line or when you start line onerror?
[03:18:08] <ph88> maybe from line 101 it goes into the callback and when returning it stays goes back to line 101 before error
[03:18:29] <Cork> ph88: the callback creates a function and returns this function to onload
[03:18:37] <ph88> i wish i could make a little video of this ...
[03:18:39] <Cork> the function is called when onload fires
[03:19:04] <greek> Hi, I have a couple hundred elements on a page. I am showing / hiding them based on certain events. I'm trying to display a "Working..." loading message whilst the showing / hiding is taking place. But it seems all the show / hide calls are done in parallel. Is there anyway to set / check a start and end point before / after calling all the shows / hides (so that I know when to show and hide the "Working..." message)? Thanks
[03:19:45] <greek> Cause what's currently happening is I show "Working..." before calling all my show / hides, and then I call it again at the end. But it's hiding it immediately
[03:20:32] <Cork> greek: try separate the questions from the explanation, else it becomes very tedious to answer
[03:21:33] <unnu> so is there an easy way to figure out the # of elements on a page and which one you clicked . . . i saw the :eq() selector but i cant do $('.class').eq();
[03:21:40] <greek> Cork, I need to be able to check when a long sequence of show() calls have all completed.
[03:22:07] <Cork> unnu: are you talking about .index() ?
[03:22:18] <greek> Cork, I see there is a callback function. My best guess is to set a flag in each show's callback. Then at the end test all the flags.
[03:22:36] <Cork> greek: ya, that or you could use deferred
[03:22:41] <Cork> and $.when
[03:22:51] <greek> Cork deferred? That's news to me
[03:22:53] <greek> thanks
[03:23:06] <unnu> yup
[03:25:17] <greek> Cork,  if I'm interpreting this correctly, I can just slap .animate({queue: false}) on to the end of every show() / hide() call
[03:25:44] <greek> No wait I misread that
[03:25:46] <unnu> Thanks for all your help Cork, this WYSIWYG image manager script is about done
[03:25:47] <unnu> :D
[03:27:35] <Cork> greek: $.when($().show().promise(), $().show().promise(), $().show().promise(), $().show().promise(), $().show().promise()).done(function() { alert('all done') })
[03:29:06] <Cork> greek: actually sorry...
[03:29:11] <Cork> you don't need the promise call there
[03:29:34] <Cork> greek: so just $.when($().show(), $().show(), $().show(), $().show(), $().show()).done(function() { alert('all done') })
[03:29:36] <Cork> should work
[03:30:17] <Cork> hmm could have sworn you needed to call a function to get the deferred object...
[03:31:31] <greek> Cork this is great I'll study the docs to work out the details. Had no idea this was possible. Thanks
[03:31:58] <Cork> greek: it's all in the magics of deferred, (though it is quite simple actually)
[03:38:46] <nardev> Cork, where are you from
[03:38:52] <Cork> sweden
[03:39:17] <nardev> nice :)
[03:57:13] <zandman_26> Hi all trying to add a eventlistner to submit but its not getting called. code can be found on: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7152861
[04:07:01] <zandman_26> Annyone here or all AFK?
[04:09:21] <anli> Seems like .width() returns null for me
[04:11:14] <zandman_26> Ok. and element got a width?
[04:14:08] <zandman_26> might also be related to that the object it self is null, hard call when you not knowing anything else
[04:15:13] <anli> I want to compare the difference in screen coordinates between two elements, can I do that?
[04:23:24] <zandman_26> well the math is sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y2 - y2)^2)
[04:24:55] <zandman_26> cause really screen distance is just the same as normal distance.
[04:26:38] <zandman_26> and sence all elements are positioned via pixels on the web that formula should work. But for the null reference in width I need more info on the code
[04:34:55] <cusco> hi folks
[04:36:36] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/kBLs2/ <-- could someone explain why I can't have a function within the function in the prototype? ;o
[04:37:04] <DRSK> bascially I'm figuring I'd like Plugin.prototype.yourOtherFunction.anotherFunction
[04:37:39] <Cork> DRSK: cause you arn't exposing the function from the first function
[04:38:03] <DRSK> How could I do that? Eventually I'd like to use something like yourOtherFunction[ something within ];
[04:38:16] <Cork> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/kBLs2/1/
[04:39:27] <DRSK> Cork Â» I'm getting the same error on that one though; I'm basically trying to set up someFunction to contain several other functions, and based on an option it'll run the someFunction.optionFunction
[04:39:49] <zandman_26> Can anyone awnser me on why my submit eventlistner is not being called? CODE: http://jsfiddle.net/kBLs2/
[04:40:08] <Cork> DRSK: this.yourOtherFunction.anotherFunction(); => this.yourOtherFunction().anotherFunction();
[04:40:10] <zandman_26> sry wrong link: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7152861
[04:48:48] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/kBLs2/2/ @Â Cork -> how would I be able to use this.yourOtherFunction[ a function ]; and still be able to have multiple ones within "yourOtherFunction" just not returning the one?
[04:51:58] <DRSK> So I'd be able to pass a value to decide what function (within the function) to use. Basically wanting to do; Plugin.prototype.animation.something and Plugin.prototype.animation.somethingelse being able to call it like this.animation[ something ];
[04:52:06] <ph88> Cork: not ok for private message ?
[04:52:50] <Cork> DRSK: a function variable can't have sub functions
[04:53:05] <Cork> DRSK: you would have to build a constructor for that to work
[04:53:37] <DRSK> You mean actually doing Plugin.prototype.animation = { stuff } and somehow.. have the plugin take it? Trying to follow hehe
[04:54:01] <Cork> DRSK: well no you would have to have an additional for the function you want
[04:54:08] <Cork> as you want it to be a separate constructor
[04:54:39] <Cork> simplest is prob to just have the function take it's sub function as a string argument
[04:54:55] <Cork> would make things simpler
[04:55:00] <DRSK> any chance you could show me what you're thinking?
[04:55:15] <Cork> not right now no
[04:55:24] <DRSK> All right, thanks for your help!
[04:56:36] <Cork> ph88: no i don't like pm's cause they are forcing me to move focus instead of just glancing
[04:56:49] <DRSK> Oh wait I think I understood what you meant; yourOtherFunction: function ( type ) { ... } then calling it using yourOtherFunction( 'string' ); and have a few ifs etc or whatnot?
[04:57:14] <Cork> yes
[04:57:29] <Cork> ph88: also it means noone else can learn from response
[05:03:20] <ph88> Cork: can you have a look at this ? https://mega.co.nz/#!ndRjCQBI!VQEqG1DdNH8RNqNgsPVLCCY6G3lOn1JQFvNuGJFZ_mU
[05:03:56] <Cork> eh, a download?
[05:04:00] <Cork> what is it?
[05:04:13] <ph88> a little movie clip of my debugger
[05:04:40] <Cork> not right now no
[05:05:06] <Cork> i could do it in about 2-3h
[05:05:28] <ph88> ok cool
[05:05:36] <ph88> i'll re-upload it then at that time
[05:05:40] <ph88> because i just deleted it
[05:52:32] <greek> Regarding this pastie - http://pastie.org/8429644 - I want to hide the loading gif once all the other divs have completed their show() methods. Currently my code is hiding the loading gif immediately.
[05:52:38] <greek> Cork if you're still around ^^
[05:53:01] <greek> Struggling to come right with the $.when and deferred objects; it's a little over my head
[05:53:11] <Cork> greek: you arn't animating so it shouldn't be like that
[05:53:55] <greek> Cork yeah that's what I figured. The docs say, unless I'm animating, then show() / hide() only tweaks the "display" CSS directive - which I understand to be instantaneous
[05:53:57] <Cork> greek: if that is one big function there really isn't any point in those calls
[05:54:17] <Cork> greek: what is it your trying to do?
[05:54:21] <greek> (that's a very basic summary of the code)
[05:55:25] <greek> Cork, basically I've got a really big table, and I'm applying multiple filters to it dynamically based on user interaction. Each filter takes a second or two to complete. So when a filter is specified, I'm wanting to show a "loading gif" and then hide it again. In between that, I'm hiding the entire table and then showing the bits that match the filter.
[05:55:58] <Cork> greek: ok
[05:56:11] <Cork> the page can't change while js is running
[05:56:40] <Cork> so you would have to delay the filter until the dom has been updated
[05:57:14] <greek> I'm with you so far.
[05:57:18] <Cork> greek: the simplest way to do that is to do setTimeout(function() { /*do the filter*/ /* hide throbber */ });
[05:57:33] <Cork> that will give the browser a tick so it can do the dom updates
[05:57:53] <greek> with setTimeout, do I need to guess the amount of time up front? Or is it possible to use flags to determine when everything is ready?
[05:58:01] <Cork> no
[05:58:13] <Cork> you could do a 0 ms delay
[05:58:19] <Cork> it will always be at least one tick
[05:58:54] <greek> Ok great I'll play around with that. Thanks again
[06:02:58] <Mattx> Hello
[06:03:34] <Mattx> I have a pretty straightforward code that looks like this: signin.click(username.focus)
[06:03:52] <Mattx> the problem is that this username input is actually hidden until you click signin (which is an icon in a toolbar)
[06:04:12] <Mattx> so the focus is executed but has no effect, because it's called before the input is shown
[06:04:20] <Mattx> is there any workaround?
[06:04:25] <seutje> are you trying to trigger focus upon clicking the signing?
[06:04:44] <seutje> so... show it before throwing the focus there?
[06:04:56] <Mattx> yes, I'm trying to do so
[06:05:22] <Cork> Mattx: are you animating it when you show it or something like that?
[06:05:24] <Mattx> I want the username field to be focused once the form appears
[06:05:28] <seutje> signin.on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); username.show().focus(); });
[06:05:42] <Mattx> no, it's not me showing the form, it's inside a dropdown menu (bootstrap)
[06:05:52] <seutje> you know what would be awesome
[06:05:57] <seutje> less pseudo code, more real code
[06:06:03] <Cork> :)
[06:06:36] <seutje> had a client couple days ago who kept iterating over what it shouldn't look like
[06:06:36] <Mattx> it's not pseudocode, what else do you need? all I have is this .click line...
[06:06:51] <seutje> if that's all, u got a bunch of undefined variables
[06:07:30] <Cork> also .click(username.focus) would never be safe
[06:07:34] <Mattx> well, do you really need to read the var signin = $('#whatever'); var username = signin.find('input[type=text]') ? ;)
[06:07:35] <Cork> cause the reference to username would be lost
[06:09:02] <Mattx> err, I meant: var username = $("#form").find(...)
[06:09:32] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/sC8uy/ works for me
[06:09:43] <googol7> Hi, I have a footer with data-position="fixed" and would like dialog pages to display them properly on the bottom of the window and not within the dialog page. How can i achieve this. Made a testpage here: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/721/
[06:10:01] <Mattx> seutje, the input is not shown until you click "click me"
[06:10:23] <Mattx> the problem is, my .click callback is called BEFORE bootstrap shows the form in a dropdown menu
[06:10:29] <Cork> Mattx: please show an example where you see the problem
[06:10:39] <Cork> we can site here and throw guesses at you all day
[06:10:49] <Mattx> ok, let me write an example or something
[06:10:54] <Cork> or we can get to see the problem and tell you how to solve it
[06:11:28] <seutje> Mattx: works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/sC8uy/1/
[06:11:36] <seutje> shall I keep guessing?
[06:17:07] <Mattx> I think that would work actually, thanks
[06:18:01] <t432> Notice how the twitter likes messages appear stacked on top of each other sorted by latest message.  How is this achieved? http://tinyurl.com/qgy5zs6
[06:18:45] <seutje> googol7: this seems to be a known issue in jq mobile
[06:19:12] <seutje> googol7: only workaround I can find real quick is to not have a fixed header on the first page
[06:19:15] <googol7> seutje: is there a bug / feature request already filed?
[06:21:10] <seutje> googol7: can't find a bug report, but found a couple related stackoverflow issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17549198/jquery-mobile-jumping-fixed-header-after-closing-dialog-firefox
[06:21:15] <t432> anyone?
[06:22:09] <seutje> t432: go inspect element and look at the script block right above it
[06:22:26] <seutje> it's like not even 20 lines
[06:28:58] <DarsVaeda> I failed to understand this concept so far, how to I append the stuff in line 24 to the element in line 2 - http://pastebin.com/P6XFg8Dq
[06:29:18] <DarsVaeda> it will always be appended to the last element in the for loop not the one in question
[06:29:40] <DarsVaeda> I mean "how do I"
[06:36:08] <seutje> DarsVaeda: instead of putting it in a variable, push it in and array and use the key in the response handler
[06:36:29] <DarsVaeda> I tried that too but then every element has all the li's
[06:36:39] <DarsVaeda> I'm always linking to some wrong thing
[06:36:47] <seutje> oh wait
[06:37:09] <seutje> my bad, closure should do
[06:37:47] <googol7> seutje: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6660
[06:37:47] <b-ot> googol7: Issue #6660 by googol7 (11m 44s ago): A footer with fixed toolbar displays within dialog page instead of at the bottom of the window.
[06:38:23] <googol7> the problem is that you'll have to set the active state manually and that's not working very well
[06:38:36] <seutje> googol7: oh, my bad
[06:38:48] <seutje> DarsVaeda: http://pastebin.com/ujCBNLGr ?
[06:38:48] <googol7> just filed the "bug" ;)
[06:38:59] <seutje> googol7: well, at least now u know :D
[06:39:46] <seutje> DarsVaeda: note that for(i in data.result) { is unsafe
[06:40:05] <DarsVaeda> okay, I'll try to wrap my head around that code first ^^
[06:40:06] <seutje> should hasOwnProperty check to see ur not grabbing cruft off the prototype
[06:40:13] <DarsVaeda> okay
[06:40:18] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[06:40:21] <googol7> yes - but setting the active state is not working very well - at least that's my experience. how would you do that properly?
[06:40:38] <googol7> so that it behaves just like the active state for internal footers?
[06:40:41] <seutje> DarsVaeda: basically, it wraps the contents of the loop in an immediately invoked function expression, creating a scope for the element variable
[06:40:49] <seutje> so it stays the same within that function
[06:41:06] <DarsVaeda> I see it is easier than I thought initially
[06:41:09] <seutje> googol7: no clue tbh
[06:41:53] <seutje> DarsVaeda: but you should also fix those unsafe loops
[06:45:48] <DarsVaeda> http://pastebin.com/4FCBPU16
[06:46:25] <DarsVaeda> I hope that fixed it :)
[06:48:37] <DarsVaeda> okay an actual jquery question hopefully ^^ in line 15 I try to fadeIn every element, but they just fadeIn all at once?
[06:55:31] <gvo> the fadein doesn't wait.
[06:57:50] <DarsVaeda> ahh I got it
[06:58:10] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[06:58:27] <t432> Cork: around?
[07:01:27] <codephobic> hi
[07:02:09] <codephobic> what's the best way to get professional - smooth and robust - slides, fades and other animations in jQuery? is it just to use jqueryui?
[07:02:47] <codephobic> when I do something simple like a slideUp() ... it flickers, stammers sometimes and generally looks jerky on some browsers.
[07:03:01] <codephobic> are there any good tutorials I might read online?
[07:03:37] <jedimind> jankfree.org
[07:03:45] <jedimind> basically leverage css3 more and less javascript
[07:04:15] <jedimind> codephobic there are some rather advanced topics covered on jankfree.org
[07:04:20] <jedimind> its not easy optimizing animations and whatnot
[07:04:38] <codephobic> jedimind, thanks for that link, looks like a lot of good content.
[07:05:53] <codephobic> the irritating thing is that, 4-5 years ago, I last used jQuery for animation and I made some fairly robust slides and stuff, for clients. Then I spent 3years working in an entirely different field, now I can't really remember any of the things I used to do.
[07:06:10] <jedimind> landscape has changed drastically over 4-5 years
[07:06:14] <codephobic> yeah
[07:06:24] <codephobic> I looked at my ajax calls the other day :no:
[07:06:40] <codephobic> just changed over to using .done(), .fail() etc.
[07:07:01] <codephobic> gotta learn about multiple chained ajax calls ...
[07:07:03] <codephobic> :(
[07:07:16] <codephobic> I'm going to remain forever a newbie at this rate.
[07:07:17] <codephobic> lol
[07:08:26] <sacho> why do you have to learn about that?
[07:09:48] <codephobic> I'm creating a front-end that involves a lot of forms and I need to make it part of a responsive website, so even trivial things like sliding up completed sections, sliding down feedback on validation etc need scripting in jquery
[07:10:22] <grafi> they do?
[07:11:00] <regedit> $.ajax(...).done(function(data){ if(whatever) { /* can I delegate execution from here */ } }).fail(function(data){ /* to here */ }); // ?
[07:11:58] <joro> maybe call a different function in both cases?
[07:11:58] <regedit> as in from the .done() -> to the .fail(), under some conditions
[07:12:10] <regedit> ye i was gonna do that,
[07:12:25] <regedit> was just wondering if jquery had some functionality in place for this
[07:12:38] <regedit> i thought the delegate system was supposed to be like that
[07:13:14] <t4nk904> is there anyone used jquery chart plugins?
[07:13:24] <t4nk904> can i ask you help me?
[07:13:32] <codephobic> grafi, I need to make sure that I validate and save form data incrementally (because of the overall size of the form), so jquery->ajax->db for sections and then feedback ...
[07:14:14] <t4nk904> is there anyone used jquery chart plugins before? i need a quick and serious help?
[07:14:38] <joro> not sure regedit
[07:15:00] <joro> you are going to call the same function eventually
[07:15:08] <t4nk904> can i ask you help me or say sth about my issue?
[07:15:11] <joro> so why go from done to fail? and then to the function
[07:15:35] <regedit> joro: no there are no further function calls, just a few lines of code to execute no more
[07:15:56] <regedit> don't want it copy-pasted in the .done() and the .fail()
[07:16:03] <joro> i know
[07:16:18] <djd> Any Idea on how to  make a multipart XHR request with a nested object?
[07:16:22] <t4nk904> i really ask you help me because i'm so depressed of jquery chart plugins
[07:16:41] <joro> but why call another method to call the function you can call directly? ?
[07:16:50] <regedit> t4nk904: ask the actual question maybe someone here will help (note the 'maybe')
[07:17:33] <joro> to save creating another function?
[07:17:35] <regedit> joro: you mean the inline function(data){} i pass to .fail() ? good point...
[07:17:53] <djd> my object is this  {user: {email:'as@a.com',profile_image:IMAGE_BLOB}
[07:17:57] <t4nk904> i need to twick date lable in jquery chart plugins but when i do that their sorting has shuffled ?
[07:18:25] <joro> if you create another funtion, you can just do .fail(function)
[07:18:33] <joro> and call the same function
[07:18:35] <code_ph0y> hey guys am stuck how do you create a flash banner
[07:18:58] <t4nk904> i use jquery document ready to change them after page and chart has loaded completely but i think my work is not correct i need to twick plugins to made
[07:19:01] <joro> seems shorter to me
[07:19:05] <code_ph0y> I have the functions with the tweens but when I loop them the browser crashes
[07:19:11] <t4nk904> jalali date instead of geogrian date?
[07:19:26] <regedit> joro: yup good point didn't think of that, thanks
[07:19:45] <joro> np
[07:20:11] <t4nk904> can i ask you introduce another jquery chatroom?
[07:20:37] <regedit> joro: oh but what if i need to pass params
[07:20:50] <jop007> when I have a select using jq mobile the page background becomes total black is this adjustable?
[07:20:52] <t4nk904> i need quick help , my cutomer want to say their chart customized?
[07:20:53] <regedit> how do i do that in the .fail() without function(){}
[07:21:10] <joro> function(x,y)
[07:21:22] <joro> same
[07:21:37] <regedit> joro: .fail(my_func(x,y)); like that? interesting
[07:21:58] <regedit> didnt know that was legal JS
[07:22:16] <joro> i didn't know it's not legal :)
[07:22:51] <regedit> joro: dont you have to pass an actual function reference, like my_func?
[07:23:02] <regedit> my_func(x,y) looks like a function call to me
[07:23:10] <regedit> not a reference to the func
[07:23:20] <joro> yea
[07:23:33] <joro> sec
[07:23:55] <joro> i mean you can
[07:24:09] <joro> .fail(function() { my_func(x,y)});
[07:24:18] <code_ph0y> anyone?
[07:24:34] <regedit> joro: and there goes our little 'optimization'...
[07:24:43] <regedit> of not making an extra function(){}
[07:24:52] <joro> you are not making it extra
[07:25:10] <joro> but i think you can try it without the anonymous function
[07:25:19] <joro> it should work
[07:25:30] <regedit> that would be interesting
[07:25:34] <regedit> surprising even
[07:27:37] <joro> wait
[07:28:20] <joro> i mean like this
[07:30:16] <joro> http://jsfiddle.net/DHAD8/1/
[07:30:16] <regedit> ah the word I was looking for was ajax 'deferred's
[07:30:34] <joro> this is what i meant
[07:30:45] <regedit> i wonder if my original question can be solved with something like http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[07:31:05] <regedit> joro: yup i got that
[07:31:38] <joro> i think it's a good solution
[07:33:31] <regedit> ye was gonna do that anyway, was just wondering if jquery had something fancy with the deferreds to redirect from .done() to .fail() or something
[07:33:34] <regedit> thanks
[07:34:48] <lucenut_> Hey guys. I only tinker with jquery every few months so not an expert. I am saddened to see in Firefox the "Error Console" is gone.
[07:35:06] <lucenut_> I never could make heads or tails of firebug.
[07:35:22] <lucenut_> But now FF seems to have an elaborate thing like FB built-in.
[07:36:04] <lucenut_> I am having trouble with the standard jquery datepicker not putting the selected value into the textbox in FF and IE (works in chrome).
[07:37:18] <joro> regedit maybe you can trigger the fail event
[07:37:37] <regedit> how?
[07:38:18] <joro> hmm
[07:39:25] <Sendoushi> hey guys!
[07:40:00] <Sendoushi> i'm adding on the end of each anim of a specific element a new anim but these are making some kind of easing. they're not going with "flow" between the anims
[07:41:08] <Sendoushi> any idea why or what should i do?
[07:41:49] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi: Have an example to show us?
[07:41:57] <nexus2911> hello room.  I would like this 	<a class='colorbox-node' href='alliances?width=300&height=350'></a> to fire automatically after 5 seconds without having to click anything
[07:42:05] <Sendoushi> BillCriswell, a sec...
[07:42:33] <nexus2911> I had a set timer event, but having trouble getting the syntax right
[07:42:52] <Sendoushi> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/c82qk/
[07:43:05] <BillCriswell> nexus2911: setTimeout(function(){ $('.link').trigger('click'); }, 5000);
[07:43:16] <ph88> Cork: another day, i'm going home soon
[07:43:23] <BillCriswell> Er, .colorbox-node
[07:43:29] <BillCriswell> Didn't see the class you supplied.
[07:44:01] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi: Haha, awesome.
[07:44:16] <Sendoushi> kind of kind of BillCriswell :p but as you can see... something is wrong between animations
[07:44:25] <Sendoushi> i still have to set the speeds right
[07:45:34] <grafi> there has to be an easier way :o
[07:45:50] <grafi> looks cool though Sendoushi
[07:46:16] <Sendoushi> grafi, i'm a perfeccionist so... :D
[07:46:26] <Sendoushi> any idea on how to solve this?
[07:46:29] <nexus2911> BillCriswell: thank you, I'm doing something wrong: http://pastebin.com/kF7k28dR
[07:46:35] <grafi> the speed thing?
[07:46:37] <grafi> nope
[07:46:51] <Sendoushi> found out... easing wasn't default as linear
[07:46:58] <grafi> oh yeah
[07:47:02] <grafi> that makes sense
[07:48:20] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi: Even with them all linear it doesn't feel that smooth... but it might be what you were going for.
[07:48:46] <Sendoushi> yes but i think that now the smoothness is the speed value that needs to be adjusted
[07:48:47] <Sendoushi> :)
[07:49:37] <petey_> I'm having trouble debugging something in Chrome, I set up an element to break on attribute modification, but it takes me to jquery every time. It's annoying. Is there a way around this?
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi: My initial thought process had me thinking a rotating background image.
[07:49:57] <joro> yea petey
[07:50:52] <joro> in the middle of the debugging
[07:51:03] <joro> bottom left you see a pause button
[07:51:10] <joro> click it;)
[07:51:12] <Sendoushi> BillCriswell, rotating background image?
[07:51:18] <Sendoushi> as in a gif?
[07:51:44] <joro> petey_: see it?
[07:52:59] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi I was thinking gradient possibly.
[07:53:02] <petey_> It's like a pause/play button
[07:54:45] <petey_> thank you joro :)
[07:55:54] <joro> np it was bugging me too :)
[07:56:45] <nexus2911> BillCriswell: works!  thank you.  solved with jquery noConflict  http://pastebin.com/K3nBMmVy

[08:46:05] <MalMen> thank you
[08:46:20] <duch_kazatel> mala what don't you understand?
[08:46:36] <duch_kazatel> err MalMen
[08:47:54] <MalMen> duch_kazatel it is that bad ? :x
[08:48:42] <duch_kazatel> MalMen what are you having a hard time with?
[08:49:29] <grafi> arrays
[08:49:30] <grafi> xD
[08:49:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[08:49:56] <grafi> baddum tz
[08:50:02] <MalMen> if i try to use the exampele that i gave to you give me SyntaxError: syntax error
[08:50:05] <duch_kazatel> so MalMen, arrays hold objects.  you iterate through them and do something with each index.
[08:51:15] <duch_kazatel> MalMen this line: sampleData[] = { "Day" : data.day, "Valor", data.valor}; - that doens't make sense.
[08:51:26] <duch_kazatel> are you looking to add something to an array?
[08:53:46] <nexus2911> anyone here have experience with running jquery inside a color box node?  (using Drupal 7)

[09:02:24] <nardev> hello, i want to add some property to <label> which appear SOMEWHERE after element that i select .. but if i use .next('label') it works only if there is nothing between first selected element and the label...
[09:03:38] <Bill_> nardev: .nextAll('.foo').first() perhaps?
[09:03:45] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[09:03:57] <nardev> Bill_, wil ltry :D
[09:03:59] <duch_kazatel> .after() will insert something after a selected node.
[09:04:44] <Bill_> duch_kazatel: I couldn't tell if he was selecting or creating?
[09:05:22] <duch_kazatel> "i want to add some property to <label> which appear SOMEWHERE after element that i select"
[09:05:30] <duch_kazatel> that lead me to believe he wanted .after()
[09:06:49] <nardev> Bill_, nah.. can't figure it out, this is actually code that i have: http://paste.debian.net/61633/
[09:07:10] <Bill_> duch_kazatel: Yeah, but the "add some property to <label>" part.
[09:07:10] <nardev> Bill_, focus on this part that i tried: .next('label').attr
[09:08:57] <duch_kazatel> nardev what do you mean "i want to add some property to <label> which appear SOMEWHERE after element that i select" - have some code or something you can share via jsfiddle?
[09:09:06] <Bill_> What I suggested should work: http://jsbin.com/EnoTUrO/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:10:28] <nardev> Bill_, "SOMEWHERE after element that i select" is for example <input type="radio" />
[09:10:41] <nardev> Bill_, i'm gonna prepare the case
[09:10:52] <nardev> on jsbin
[09:11:21] <Bill_> wtf mate.
[09:11:33] <duch_kazatel> yeah dude's confused lol
[09:12:25] <nardev> Bill_, http://jsbin.com/EnoTUrO/2/edit?html,js,output
[09:12:36] <nardev> Bill_, look at that html there...
[09:14:10] <Bill_> nardev: Okie dokie.
[09:14:20] <nardev> :)\
[09:14:31] <Bill_> So you want the label that's "next to" the input?
[09:18:14] <nardev> Bill_, closest to..
[09:18:15] <nardev> :D
[09:18:30] <duch_kazatel> nardev "closest to" meaning closest before or after?
[09:18:30] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:18:32] <nardev> yes Bill_ i think that you got it because i want to be able to change layout
[09:18:39] <nardev> after
[09:18:45] <nardev> duch_kazatel,
[09:18:50] <nardev> after preferably :D
[09:19:15] <duch_kazatel> ... "preferably" lol
[09:19:40] <Bill_> nardev: http://jsbin.com/EnoTUrO/3/edit?html,js,output like this?
[09:21:01] <beatnyk> does anyone know of a cube page transition demo? I can't seem to find one anywhere
[09:21:11] <nardev> Bill_, :( NO.. :( i need to set 'for' attribute for each <label>
[09:21:13] <beatnyk> or even any kind of slick page transition demo
[09:21:17] <t432> anyone one aware of an query library for twitter like feed?
[09:21:25] <t432> any*
[09:21:31] <nardev> Bill_, and it should not rely on any other element like <tr>
[09:22:22] <duch_kazatel> t432 huh?  twitter uses bootstrap (they made it) and infinite scrolling.
[09:22:55] <grafi> i use finite scrolling
[09:23:37] <Bill_> nardev: http://jsbin.com/EnoTUrO/5/edit?html,js,output
[09:24:06] <t432> duch_kazatel: do you have an example that showcases the timeline (messages stacked on top of each other, sorted bt date)?
[09:24:47] <duch_kazatel> t432 there's no single solution front-to-back that does that.  you'd have to build that yourself.
[09:25:00] <duch_kazatel> the frontend uses bootstrap for display and infinite scrolling to load content.
[09:25:11] <duch_kazatel> *infinite scorlling referring to the ajax technique.
[09:25:22] <nardev> BillCriswell, :( it should not rely on any other element like 'tr' or so.. because in another cases i want to be able to change layout a bit...
[09:25:36] <duch_kazatel> t432 http://getbootstrap.com/ is the frontent lib they use.
[09:26:09] <t432> duch_kazatel: can you briefly explain to me how I can implement a timeline (with bootstrap and jquery)
[09:26:35] <grafi> oÃ´
[09:26:35] <BillCriswell> nardev: How do you expect to make a relation to two elements without any type of structure in place?
[09:26:42] <duch_kazatel> t432 err...
[09:26:46] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:26:49] <t432> lol
[09:26:56] <duch_kazatel> t432 what's not clear?
[09:26:58] <t432> i should be a little clearer
[09:27:17] <t432> ok, let scorll back
[09:27:20] <t432> scroll*
[09:27:31] <nardev> BillCriswell, i expected that i can find next occurrence of some element after element X
[09:27:46] <nardev> no meter where after...
[09:28:37] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:29:18] <grafi> within bounds
[09:29:41] <BillCriswell> nardev: after would look through the siblings after an element.
[09:30:05] <nardev> BillCriswell, i'll try...
[09:30:40] <nardev> BillCriswell, maybe this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7616587/next-occurrence-of-something-down-the-dom-tree
[09:30:43] <t432> duch_kazatel: do have a link for "infinite scolling" feature?
[09:30:55] <t432> google throwing up all kinds of libs with that name
[09:31:13] <duch_kazatel> t432 what are you not clear on?
[09:32:01] <duch_kazatel> t432 you're going to have to do some coding on your own ;)
[09:32:18] <duch_kazatel> the principles are relatively simple, so I'm not sure where your confusion lies.
[09:32:35] <BillCriswell> nardev: You have nothing tying the label to the label besides the structure of the HTML.
[09:32:38] <t432> duch_kazatel: that part between font-to-back.  I am wondering how a similar timeline would be coded
[09:32:51] <nardev> BillCriswell, that is right
[09:33:19] <t432> duch_kazatel: This infinite scollring feature, does it come with bootstrap?
[09:33:24] <t432> scrolling*
[09:33:26] <duch_kazatel> t432 no.
[09:33:46] <duch_kazatel> t432 in infinite scrolling you need some sort of service to push out html fragments or JSON.
[09:34:16] <BillCriswell> tying the label to the input besides html structure*
[09:34:28] <duch_kazatel> then, on some event, like a user clicking a button or reaching a certain part of the page, you fire a request to get the next batch of results and push them into the document.
[09:35:22] <duch_kazatel> t432 there's no all-encompassing way to do that. you'll need to figure out how to wire that together for your own platform.
[09:35:31] <duch_kazatel> there are plenty of tutorials out there.
[09:35:47] <t432> duch_kazatel: can you give me a link?
[09:36:03] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=infinite+scrollung+tutorial&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[09:36:13] <duch_kazatel> lol typo and all.
[09:36:17] <duch_kazatel> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-create-an-infinite-scroll-web-gallery/
[09:36:19] <duch_kazatel> there's one,.'
[09:36:21] <t432> duch_kazatel: how about this? https://github.com/seaofclouds/tweet
[09:36:42] <duch_kazatel> t432 ... what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[09:37:06] <t432> duch_kazatel: a twitter like timeline
[09:37:17] <duch_kazatel> t432 okay - how would what you linked help you with that?
[09:37:29] <duch_kazatel> what does "a twitter like timeline" include to you?
[09:37:47] <duch_kazatel> t432 there is no single-serving system that will help you.
[09:37:57] <duch_kazatel> read the tutsplus tutorial i linked.
[09:37:59] <t432> duch_kazatel: it a timeline with messages form a custom data source (non twitter)
[09:38:23] <duch_kazatel> t432 read the tutorial.
[09:38:30] <duch_kazatel> try to implement.
[09:38:40] <t432> ok
[09:39:02] <duch_kazatel> t432 there';s no all encompassing setup that will work for everybody,
[09:40:04] <t432> duch_kazatel: ah, i see.  Just what i was after.  I wass getting my terms mixed up.
[09:40:54] <duch_kazatel> t432 it's more a technique.  there are libraries out there that can help you accomplish it, but you have to do some heavy lifting yourself.
[09:41:29] <t432> can i have the links for these libs?
[09:41:33] <t432> names will do.
[09:41:35] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:41:36] <duch_kazatel> google.
[09:41:42] <duch_kazatel> I don't have a cache of these links for you.
[09:41:43] <t432> names
[09:41:46] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[09:41:49] <duch_kazatel> google.
[09:41:51] <t432> :)
[09:41:51] <duch_kazatel> search it yourself.
[09:41:56] <t432> ok
[09:42:04] <duch_kazatel> i'
[09:42:22] <duch_kazatel> *i've setup infinite scrolling before - there are TONS of options for you.  really depends on what you need.

[09:46:20] <duch_kazatel> you can't group selectors like that btw.
[09:46:31] <Error404NotFound> What i tried was wrong, just shot in dark
[09:46:57] <Error404NotFound> I am trying to make this bit compact, if possible because its painful to read
[09:46:58] <RonWhoCares> What jquery tool is available to select multiple items from a list
[09:47:31] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to find all img's with a given source inside of div.first-class.second-class and div.first-class.third-class?
[09:48:09] <duch_kazatel> why not just use $('div.first-class img[src*="somesource"]')
[09:48:41] <Error404NotFound> duch_kazatel: it would select some other images i don't want it to select
[09:49:06] <duch_kazatel> Error404NotFound afaik there's no way to "make that bit compact"
[09:49:15] <Error404NotFound> duch_kazatel: i see, thanks

[10:12:11] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:14:06] <clime> anyone experienced with jquery.pjax plugin? (ajax requests that are pushed into history)
[10:14:58] <clime> i am so sick of that plugin xD
[10:15:22] <duch_kazatel> clime i looked at it and would up rolling my own solution.  fyi it does a lot more than pushstate management.
[10:15:45] <duch_kazatel> and cuqa $("audio")[key] isn't valid...
[10:16:18] <cuqa> why not?
[10:16:41] <duch_kazatel> cuqa what is key set to?
[10:18:09] <cuqa> I have lots of audio elements in my html, the key represents the nth audio element which is controlled
[10:18:31] <duch_kazatel> c4 is not a valid array index.
[10:18:34] <clime> duch_kazatel: ye, it was nice that it actually changes url when you e.g. do some filtering/search on your page so you can filter something out and send that to another person. I have been using it for like half a year during development but now I have found out that it is basically impossible to upload more than one container with it (not supporting json responses)
[10:19:01] <clime> *update more than one container...
[10:19:48] <duch_kazatel> clime ouch.  yeah i wound up rolling my own pushstate support.
[10:19:48] <clime> duch_kazatel: what more can it done than state management?
[10:19:59] <cuqa> the array index starts at 0 and ends at # of elements -1
[10:20:17] <duch_kazatel> cuqa you're setting key to c4.
[10:20:17] <cuqa> so currently it's something between 0 and 88
[10:20:27] <duch_kazatel> cuqa c4 is not a valid array index.
[10:20:53] <duch_kazatel> and clime it's meant to bunch of extra ajax business for you so your whole site is basically ajax driven.
[10:20:56] <duch_kazatel> makes it a little quickle.r
[10:21:05] <cuqa> ah duch_kazatel , cool thx
[10:21:11] <cuqa> now it works
[10:23:50] <clime> duch_kazatel: ok, ill use my own solution, thanks
[10:24:00] <duch_kazatel> clime do you need the ajax support?
[10:24:45] <clime> duch_kazatel: well the ajax support is easy and ye I would like it. The hard part is that state pushing stuff but ill probably go without it for some time
[10:25:18] <clime> i mean changing the url on ajax requests - that is a nice feature
[10:25:52] <clime> but not sure how it work with back button etc, so I am not really able to implement something like that i guess
[10:25:52] <duch_kazatel> pjax does that for you.  you can also roll your own solution to do that.
[10:25:54] <duch_kazatel> i did that a while ago.
[10:26:00] <duch_kazatel> clime huh?
[10:26:12] <duch_kazatel> clime you can capture popstates and handle the back button from there.
[10:26:53] <duch_kazatel> clime check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[10:27:05] <Guest70232> hi
[10:27:10] <joroci> LO
[10:27:13] <joroci> oops
[10:27:14] <duch_kazatel> hey ho
[10:31:03] <clime> duch_kazatel: when you said "fyi it does a lot more than pushstate management." - were you talking about your solution or pjax:)
[10:31:11] <duch_kazatel> pjax.
[10:31:19] <clime> duch_kazatel: and what else it does?
[10:31:58] <duch_kazatel> "pjax loads html from your server into the current page without a full page load. It's ajax with real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades. "
[10:32:01] <duch_kazatel> they descript it.
[10:32:15] <duch_kazatel> *describe
[10:32:27] <duch_kazatel> it manages your pushstates and ajax
[10:32:33] <clime> duch_kazatel: ok i see
[10:33:06] <clime> duch_kazatel: and do you think it can be used even if you update only part of your page and the whole page?
[10:34:13] <clime> duch_kazatel: bad question, clearly it can be used as you want
[10:34:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:34:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah you can set it up however you'd like.
[10:38:17] <Guest70232> I am calling an onClick="someMethod()  on a div.  now the div has many parents in the dom hirarchy.   1. I want to pass the current div object of the div in that method  2. I want to pass the  object of first parent that has .someClass
[10:38:53] <duch_kazatel> Guest70232 have any code?
[10:39:08] <Guest70232> is this the correct what?    onClick="someMethod(   $(this).parents(".someParentClass").first()   ); ?
[10:39:12] <Guest70232> duch_kazatel,  ^
[10:39:22] <Guest70232> correct way*
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> Guest70232 don't use onclick.
[10:39:59] <Guest70232> then?

[10:57:23] <clime> duch_kazatel: so basically to make back button working properly, I should listen for popstate events and read state object to them. This state object should contain the ajax response associated with the state from which I should reconstruct the page (i.e. take the json structure or whatever and replace content of target containers with the content in that structure). Does it make sense or no?:)
[10:57:42] <clime> *read state objects from them

[11:12:11] <beatnyk> does anyone know of a cube page transition demo? I can't seem to find one anywhere
[11:12:38] <bookies> hi. i am working on a task for fetching data from json site. more information here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19593300/fetch-data-using-jquery-from-external-json-site-singleton-class . any help is greatly appreciated!
[11:13:04] <duch_kazatel> clime i always based it on the URL for the popstate, but that's the basic gist.
[11:13:32] <JonathanNeal> http://jqueryvalidation.org/ anyone have experience with this? Removing rules from an :input, but the input has a classname "date" and it won't forget that, it really wants it to be a date, when it's only part of a date.
[11:13:56] <duch_kazatel> aaaaand now back to work.
[11:14:51] <dannyfritz> i have an iframe that triggers an event on it's document. in the parent frame, i would like to do a $.on on the iframe document to handle triggered events on the iframe document. I'm having a lot of trouble getting the trigger to trigger anything.
[11:18:29] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  your example is very valid, i just tested it. but my scenario is something different. the div clicked opens a form, form is filled up, and then an other ajax method is called with the id of the clicked parent + values of form data
[11:19:08] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  so i need a method that sends value of clicked parent     and the values of form to be sent to ajaxMethod
[11:19:56] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ relink your example.
[11:20:49] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ nvm found it.
[11:21:52] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ wait so you need the parent node of a given object?
[11:22:23] <duch_kazatel> ah you need the ID of a parent div that has a given class.
[11:23:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/32z3W/2/
[11:23:29] <duch_kazatel> like that?
[11:24:18] <syncsys_> its like this: click on div class=A id=1.     #form opens,  fill values ,   ajaxCallMethod() is onClick of submit of form.       Question: how to give the ajaxCallMethod() the div class=A id=1.   also.   the values of form are what I can get by the #from id
[11:25:38] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ need more code to help.
[11:25:44] <duch_kazatel> your description barely makes sense to me.
[11:25:53] <duch_kazatel> something that matches what you're seeing.
[11:26:05] <syncsys_> hm ok
[11:26:56] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  just a minut then
[11:27:04] <intellilogic> I want to "extend" .on(â€˜clickâ€™... I figure if I wire a .on click and the href doesnâ€™t start with â€˜#â€™, I want to prevent it.  Instead of deciding when to do event.Prevent per .on function.  How could I go about this?
[11:27:53] <duch_kazatel> intellilogic don't extend it.  check the event target or the attr('src') for your data.
[11:28:19] <intellilogic> but I wnat to add the logic to the .on, so I don't have to do it per function.
[11:28:31] <duch_kazatel> write a function that handles it.
[11:28:52] <duch_kazatel> is this for a personal project?
[11:29:13] <intellilogic> Currently I have: function(event){ event.preventDefault();   ...sure.  but deductive reasoning an establish which needs that and which doesn't.  I want to use that logic and apply it for all .on  Personal?  My site, yes.
[11:29:42] <intellilogic> Logic says I didn't write a click event for a link that's exiting the site ;)
[11:30:00] <duch_kazatel> because the "normal" way of doing it would be to pass .on() a function that does your checking and handling.
[11:30:09] <duch_kazatel> and then use event delegation to make life easier.
[11:31:34] <intellilogic> I have a big library I use for common tasks, click are the only ones I wrote the prevent default for and I'd like to take it out of that function and bind it to .on in some fashion witht he proper logic.
[11:32:22] <intellilogic> How would I even go about "extending it" (not modding jQuery source)?
[11:33:06] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to override the default behavior on .on() - overwrite it with your own.
[11:33:45] <intellilogic> :( I certainly want to avoid that.  That makes updating jQuery a big ordeal.
[11:33:55] <duch_kazatel> that's why you don't do that ;)
[11:34:01] <clime> duch_kazatel: so you always do full reloads when a user clicks on a back button?
[11:34:07] <duch_kazatel> why can't you simpyl write a function and use that in lieu of .on()?
[11:34:30] <duch_kazatel> clime nope.  I capture the popstate event and trigger my ajax as necessary.
[11:34:31] <sacho> intellilogic, what exactly do you need to prevent?
[11:34:57] <clime> duch_kazatel: ah i see so you redo your ajax requests, nice
[11:34:59] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  almost there
[11:35:02] <duch_kazatel> intellilogic it's also pertinent to note that .on() is for general event handling, not just click events on anchors.
[11:35:21] <clime> duch_kazatel: it is an alternative to storing the ajax response in that state object param
[11:35:34] <intellilogic> duch_kazatel:  That's not a bad idea  sacho: I just want to add logic to .on click so it auto prevents default if it's href exiting the site, else I wouldn't have written a function.  Why have to specify prevent default when you can deduce it.
[11:35:45] <duch_kazatel> clime i don't store anything in the state object.
[11:36:11] <clime> duch_kazatel: ye i know. But you could and then you could reconstruct the page from that object instead of making a new ajax request
[11:36:13] <sacho> intellilogic, simply place a listener to do that on the body
[11:36:26] <duch_kazatel> clime the state object can't hold that much data I think.
[11:36:33] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  click the black arrow and then create task http://jsfiddle.net/32z3W/3/
[11:36:34] <clime> 640KB
[11:36:34] <duch_kazatel> clime in my case i needed to reload from the server.
[11:36:50] <blewp> I am trying to retrieve the value of the selected item in a select.. What am i doing wrong http://jsfiddle.net/yG2xj/ ?
[11:37:15] <duch_kazatel> blewp it's .val()
[11:37:42] <blewp> tried that too, it returns "undefined"
[11:38:27] <intellilogic> sacho: what do you mean?  for ALL links?  I just want to prevent default if there is a function written.  IE  .on('click' '#externalLink'  ... make it auto e.preventDefault because we made a function and the href has other then #anchor.  So I don't have to have e.prevent default all over my click functions.
[11:38:29] <clime> duch_kazatel: because pjax does it like I describe. But i like your method more
[11:38:34] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  wait. one update
[11:39:03] <intellilogic> I guess what I am really trying to do it make something "cute" as I am currently accomplishing the task the normal way.
[11:39:04] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ i'm sorry i can't be of much help duder... but it sounds like you're convoluting it.
[11:39:34] <syncsys_> this http://jsfiddle.net/32z3W/4/
[11:39:59] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ i'll take one more crack i guess...
[11:40:32] <intellilogic> syncsys)  That;s a kit if white space in that JS
[11:40:53] <clime> duch_kazatel: hey, thanks for discussing it. Was very useful for me.
[11:40:59] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ yeah you need to bind event listeners using .on()
[11:41:07] <unnu> Whatsup guys?
[11:41:14] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  this will help^  now i when the create task is hit.  it opens a form,   form submit button makes an ajax call.       Now , i need form values in that ajax call (thats simple to get the values by #form id and field) , but HOW to get the parent of  the clicked arow div and pass THAT to the ajax call method
[11:41:15] <duch_kazatel> clime my pleasure - it's a little weird when you first start with it, bnut eventually it makes sense.
[11:41:27] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ learn to use .on() and $(this)
[11:41:46] <unnu> .on() <3
[11:41:48] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ don't put event handler in onclick html.
[11:41:59] <duch_kazatel> *onclick html attributes.
[11:42:38] <sacho> intellilogic, duch's solution is probably the best for you.
[11:42:45] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  this is deep
[11:43:10] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ you need to learn event handling.
[11:43:33] <blewp> duch_kazatel, do you have any idea why val() returns "undefined".. when the value IS assigned?
[11:43:37] <syncsys_> no other straight ways?
[11:43:39] <unnu>  syncsys_ its easy stuff once you get into it . . .  event handling and object selection are jquery 101 and will make your life 100000x easier
[11:43:48] <unnu> learn.jquery.com
[11:43:57] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ what is a "straight" way?
[11:44:04] <duch_kazatel> learn the "right" way ;)
[11:44:10] <syncsys_> hm
[11:44:16] <unnu> ^^^^^ listen to duch
[11:44:48] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  do you mean similar to line 42 ? of js?
[11:44:52] <sacho> blewp, http://jsfiddle.net/yG2xj/2/
[11:45:44] <blewp> so what does option:selected actually do?
[11:45:55] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ sure, but don't bind to document if you don't need to.
[11:46:11] <syncsys_> can you give a hint?
[11:47:22] <intellilogic> It's not safe to assume he doesn't...  That's not causing a problem
[11:47:30] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ $('#parentContainer').on('event', 'childContainer', function(){})
[11:47:31] <duch_kazatel> lols
[11:47:32] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:48:53] <intellilogic> syncsys_ I changed the spacing of your jQuery http://jsfiddle.net/sxhxv/  Now a human can read it ;)

[11:54:13] <syncsys_> am. no one?
[11:56:43] * syncsys_ waits
[11:57:05] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  why we need .on()?

[12:23:51] <syncsys_> intellilogic,  how did you do that? by hand or some software?
[12:23:59] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  stil there?
[12:28:40] <syncsys_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19597618/getting-parent-object-and-passing-to-other-methods-via-a-form-in-between

[12:45:07] <syncsys_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19597618/getting-parent-object-and-passing-to-other-methods-via-a-form-in-between
[12:47:33] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ you're still having trouble?
[12:48:21] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  yes. I read the .on()
[12:48:33] <syncsys_> cant see how its different from function ().click
[12:48:49] <cuqa> ahey, how can I track how hard someone pressed a key?
[12:49:01] <cuqa> j/k :(
[12:49:17] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  i mean thats same as  $(".create-task-wizard").click(function (){ $("#task-creation-form").dialog( "open" ); });
[12:49:32] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  why use .on?
[12:51:30] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ i'm having a really hard time understand what your problem is.
[12:51:42] <duch_kazatel> *understanding
[12:51:48] <syncsys_> this might help  ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19597618/getting-parent-object-and-passing-to-other-methods-via-a-form-in-between
[12:52:24] <syncsys_> I need to send some params to the ajax call, that goes to server.those params and reasons would take the whole page to explain. its just that I want the id of its paren (the first parent that has a certain class) + form values.
[12:52:25] <duch_kazatel> $(this).parents('yourSelector')
[12:52:35] <duch_kazatel> if you want the ID, do:
[12:52:40] <duch_kazatel> $(this).parents('yourSelector').attr('id')
[12:52:45] <duch_kazatel> inside of your click handler.
[12:52:52] <syncsys_> ya. thats easy. just tell me how to pass it to the ajaxMethod()?
[12:52:52] <duch_kazatel> that gets your ID.
[12:53:12] <duch_kazatel> var myData = $(this).parents('yourSelector').attr('id'); ajaxMethod(myData);
[12:53:21] <duch_kazatel> that's how you pass things to functions.
[12:53:33] <syncsys_> thats the real problem...
[12:53:49] <duch_kazatel> you might have to update you ajaxMethod to accept multiple args.
[12:54:08] <duch_kazatel> or you could create a an object with properties and pass that around.
[12:54:23] <duch_kazatel> you can pass multiple objects to functions.
[12:54:25] <syncsys_> i when the create task is hit. it opens a form. the form div has one copy and an id. so geting form values is simple.    are we on the same page till here?
[12:54:53] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[12:55:14] <syncsys_> HOW to get the parent of the clicked arow div and pass THAT to the ajax call method.
[12:55:31] <syncsys_> the form is actually in between the clicked div and the ajaxmethod call
[12:56:10] <duch_kazatel> you need to store it in a globally accesible area.
[12:56:12] <duch_kazatel> *var
[12:56:31] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  ok. where to put that var
[12:56:35] <digital-ghost_> hi folks, I am running through JavaScript 101 on the learn.jquery.com site, hitting a snag with understanding function declaration. There's function expressions and function declarations, which is the preferred methodology to use?
[12:56:42] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  where is that global area?
[12:56:50] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ just assign is without using var and that'll hoist it up.
[12:56:53] <duch_kazatel> you need to learn about scope.
[12:57:24] <syncsys_> am?
[12:57:31] <duch_kazatel> i generally disourage people from assigning things and putting them in the global scope, but i get the feeling you're not really willing to ;)
[12:57:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:57:32] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:57:51] <syncsys_> where to make the var
[13:00:56] <FTT> Hi, would anyone have a helpful hint on how to debug $.getJSON? The JSON i'm trying to load is valid according to JSONLint.
[13:04:53] <StanAccy> Anuyone help with this please: http://jsfiddle.net/ZEdVZ/13/    Im trying to get the panel to drop in below the clicked link.
[13:08:05] <StanAccy> I understand why its doing what it is, just not how to fix it
[13:08:36] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/ZEdVZ/15/ @ StanAccy
[13:10:33] <StanAccy> jedimind: so thats relying on the html ordering , correct?
[13:10:47] <jedimind> yup
[13:11:00] <jedimind> not so much relying on it, as it IS html ordering
[13:11:09] <StanAccy> is there another way without relying on the ordering?
[13:14:32] <StanAccy> I noted in the jquery docs for position() that it doesnt support positioning of hidden elements, so im not sure if this is possible
[13:16:13] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ you can make the var wherever you want.  just don't prepend it with the keyword var.
[13:22:01] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  ok. window.var would be better
[13:22:57] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ that's another way
[13:23:53] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ when you don't use the var keyword it does the same thing.
[13:25:11] <syncsys_> ok
[13:25:12] <syncsys_> thanks!
[13:25:28] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ i wouldn't rely on passing around vars like that.
[13:25:58] <duch_kazatel> you should probably reconsider how your code is structured so you can explicitly pass that var to where you need it.
[13:27:45] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  so by the way. how   $(".create-box-wizard").click(function () {   is  different that .on()
[13:28:00] <duch_kazatel> syncsys_ that's not what i was talking about earlier.
[13:28:07] <syncsys_> duch_kazatel,  then?
[13:28:09] <duch_kazatel> .click() calls .on('click',
[13:28:20] <duch_kazatel> you had something within an onclick handler in your html.
[13:28:25] <duch_kazatel> that's not generally a good thing.
[13:35:41] <grafi> phew

[13:37:23] <duch_kazatel> ah

[13:39:46] <grafi> duch_kazatel did I show you the result of my svg re-creation efforts yet?
[13:40:03] <duch_kazatel> svg re-creation?
[13:40:05] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:40:46] <grafi> you remember the image i showed you? http://snapsvg.io/assets/images/background_2.svg
[13:41:14] <grafi> http://codepen.io/mstoppert/full/Cmyug
[13:41:37] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah.
[13:42:06] <grafi> it produces quite nice results at times
[13:42:20] <culh> Can all bits of code that used live() be replaced with on() without any extra concerns addressed?
[13:42:58] <grafi> if i remember correctly, grepping through my files didnt work culh ;)
[13:43:18] <duch_kazatel> culh you'll have to do some extra wrestling, but yeah you can use .on()
[13:43:49] <culh> I'm currently using live() for keys and mouse events only
[13:45:27] <duch_kazatel> culh you might want to rehash you event handling strategy if you move to .on()
[13:46:42] <culh> or keep using a late version of jq?
[13:46:50] <culh> s/late/old
[13:47:00] <duch_kazatel> culh update.
[13:47:01] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[13:47:15] <grafi> more work, yay :D
[13:47:24] <culh> sh*t
[13:47:38] <duch_kazatel> culh it's not too bad man.
[13:47:42] <duch_kazatel> how big is the codebase?
[13:47:50] <culh> Most of the evet listeners are for content loaded after first load
[13:48:06] <culh> hence the need for live()
[13:48:06] <duch_kazatel> .on() handles those pretty easily.
[13:48:19] <culh> k... so what's the problem?
[13:48:34] <duch_kazatel> .live() binds to the body.  that means you're doing a hell of a lot of filtering.
[13:49:00] <culh> on() has better performance benchmarks, then?
[13:49:23] <duch_kazatel> .on() is much more flexible.
[13:52:07] <grafi> and culh is thinking http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g1334961617145439732.jpg
[13:52:51] <culh> I've been thinking that for too long, and now it's catching up

[13:53:12] * culh also thinks it's b33r o'clock \o/

[13:59:34] <nicetry> Hey there, I want to make a span editable, and at the same time, clicked on so the user knows that are now editing that span. I found that I can change .attr('contentEditable',true); to get the first part done. Is there a way to do the second part?
[13:59:35] <duch_kazatel> how's everybody's friday going.
[14:00:00] <duch_kazatel> " clicked on so the user knows that are now editing that span." meaning...?
[14:00:04] <nicetry> I tried using .click() but it didn't seem to do the trick like a real mouse click
[14:00:16] <culh> parents comming over, going out plans are currently under elaboration
[14:00:39] <duch_kazatel> nicetry 0 .click() on the element clicks the element.
[14:01:04] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: have the blinking text-carrot showing and some sort of highlight around the area - the same way you know which input you are currently on when you tab through a form
[14:01:04] <duch_kazatel> it's the same thing, basically - have any code?
[14:03:10] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: I'll throw togeather a fiddle, basically the .click isn't acting the same as a mouse click, was wondering if there isanything else I need to do to draw focus to that span
[14:03:32] <duch_kazatel> nicetry you probably need to click the input, not the span.
[14:04:01] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: there is only a span
[14:04:06] <grafi> contenteditable has no input
[14:04:07] <grafi> :P
[14:04:18] <nicetry> grafi: what do you mean?
[14:04:26] <duch_kazatel> oooooooooh.
[14:04:38] <duch_kazatel> nicetry you need to apply custom css in that case.
[14:04:41] <grafi> was talking to duch_kazatel
[14:04:44] <duch_kazatel> forgot that's how that works.
[14:04:46] <culh> Say I've placed a listened for clicking on a input[type=checkbox]. How do I check if other input[type=checkbox] of the same name are checked?
[14:04:49] <grafi> :P
[14:04:56] <culh> listener*
[14:05:21] <duch_kazatel> culh record the name in a var and then check against that var on every click.
[14:05:35] <culh> ok, can I use each() ?
[14:05:48] <duch_kazatel> ... why would you use .each()?
[14:06:00] <clime> duch_kazatel: small update, pjax does not use that state object. It uses some own cache system. Anyway I ditched it and glad I did it finally:).
[14:06:13] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to detect a click ( without interfering with any other bound listeners ) on any element on a window?  Something like $(window).on('click' ?
[14:06:42] <culh> There may be a number of checkboxes with the same name, as in <input type=checkbox name=something_id[] />
[14:06:44] <duch_kazatel> FunnyLookinHat $('body').on('click', '*', function(){})
[14:06:53] <FunnyLookinHat> duch_kazatel, Nice thanks :D
[14:07:11] <duch_kazatel> FunnyLookinHat np.  check out the jquery docs on .on() and event delegation.
[14:07:18] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Vdj4w/1/
[14:07:22] <FunnyLookinHat> duch_kazatel, I'll do that - good cal.
[14:07:23] <duch_kazatel> and culh still not seeing where you'd use .each()
[14:07:24] <FunnyLookinHat> *call
[14:08:00] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: click edit mode, then wait a sec, (nothing will happen), then actually click on the span, you'll see you have cursor and some sort of surrounding border to indicate its editable
[14:08:19] <culh> $("input[type=checkbox]").live('keyup click mousedown', function(event) {  var field = $(this); });  //yes still using live()
[14:08:42] <culh> so from there I'd get attr('name') and then make a loop to go through all the checkboxes
[14:08:57] <duch_kazatel> culh why would you iterate through the other checkboxes?
[14:09:13] <culh> I want to color the ones that have been clicked
[14:09:15] <duch_kazatel> and nicetry you need custom styles for that.
[14:09:34] <culh> but in groups
[14:09:37] <nicetry> duch_kazatel: aside from custom styles, how can I get the cursor next to the first letter of that text
[14:09:40] <nicetry> or select that text
[14:09:47] <culh> all checkboxes of the same name have to be checked
[14:10:07] <culh> *checked if have been clicked/checked
[14:10:38] <culh> but I think there's a quicker way for this...
[14:11:32] <culh> such as $(input[type=checkbox][name=$name]).length
[14:11:33] <duch_kazatel> culh well, if you have the name, you can do something like $('input[name=' + theName + ']')
[14:11:36] <culh> or something
[14:11:45] <culh> bingo
[14:12:09] <culh> Let's check that out then
[14:12:47] <duch_kazatel> the $() function just needs an arg that evaluates to a string, so you can pass vars in that are strings.
[14:28:35] <culh> worked like a charm
[14:28:46] <culh> time for that b33r then, l8rs

[15:11:48] <bowenac> anyone willing to look at a small fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/vED9c/1/
[15:12:48] <bowenac> im trying to get the div id and set it as the rel for the img
[15:14:18] <Andri_> well I know how to use get ID using
[15:14:20] <Andri_> javascript
[15:14:46] <Andri_> you can do object.getAttribute("id");
[15:15:10] <Andri_> and put that into variable
[15:15:25] <Andri_> var x = object.getAttribute("id");
[15:15:44] <bowenac> I would need to specify the id using that method correct?
[15:15:47] <Andri_> object.setattribute("rel", x);
[15:15:56] <Andri_> yup
[15:15:57] <bowenac> cause that wont work
[15:16:08] <bowenac> the id is auto generated
[15:16:09] <krenner> Hello, when i create dialog with long title it's shortened, I would like to adjust dialog width to size of title. Where i should put screwdriver?
[15:16:18] <Andri_> you can change object to document.getElementById();
[15:16:39] <bowenac> right but I wont know what the id is
[15:16:42] <Andri_> i'm sure there is a similar method in jquery
[15:16:46] <Andri_> but I rarely use jquery
[15:16:53] <bowenac> that is why I am using parent
[15:17:17] <duch_kazatel> bowenac so you need to get something from one thing then select another thing using that as the ID?
[15:17:25] <Andri_> try to alert that var id
[15:17:36] <Andri_> if you get the value then you are on the right track
[15:17:47] <Andri_> usually that's how i test if the variable get the right value or not
[15:17:49] <bowenac> yea
[15:17:56] <bowenac> I had it once but it did the same thing
[15:17:57] <bowenac> for all of them
[15:18:12] <bowenac> so if I had gallery-1, gallery-2 it would always use gallery-1
[15:18:25] <duch_kazatel> bowenac do you have a fiddle?
[15:18:31] <Andri_> but I think it's illegal to use Id for more than one element
[15:18:34] <bowenac> rel="prettyPhoto[undefined]" is what I am getting now
[15:18:39] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/vED9c/4/
[15:18:44] <grafi> bowenac http://jsfiddle.net/vED9c/5/
[15:18:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah bowenac you cannot use the same ID more than once.
[15:18:55] <bowenac> there not the same
[15:18:55] <krenner> add prefixes
[15:18:56] <duch_kazatel> bowenac you'll wind up with problems if you do that.
[15:18:59] <bowenac> I already mentioned that
[15:19:18] <bowenac> they are auto generated gallery-1 gallery-2 gallery-3
[15:19:27] <bowenac> I am getting the id and setting it as a rel
[15:19:37] <grafi> bowenac so why not add the rel, too
[15:19:38] <duch_kazatel> so you want the ID to instead become the rel?
[15:19:45] <grafi> if you're generating
[15:20:06] <bowenac> I want to get the id of the div, and set the id of that div as the rel for the each image inside that div
[15:20:35] <bowenac> thanks grafi
[15:20:36] <bowenac> that works

[16:22:59] <JonathanNeal> yes, good old fashioned location.hash
[16:23:30] <pixelpimp> you don't need a plugin to do anything in jquery, ever.

[16:23:48] <pixelpimp> there are just many which make things easier
