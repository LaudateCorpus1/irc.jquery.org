[00:01:52] <GoSox> i just used the 'input' event to power my new search boxâ€¦ i suspect i'm going to be pretty sad when i try to use search in my browser gauntlet :(
[00:08:41] <lampe2> hey i got a select element with some option loaded with a json request. now i wanne say after it is loaded select the option 2 for the user how can i do that?
[00:09:45] <GoSox> :) my search box is SO fast
[00:09:46] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/
[00:15:18] <derelict> is there a way to inspect data set with $.data in Chrome?
[00:17:46] <dblosevn> ya in console $('selector').data();
[00:18:12] <derelict> dblosevn: thanks
[00:18:19] <dblosevn> deadalus: np
[00:18:59] <dblosevn> oops derelict lol
[00:20:27] <derelict> dblosevn: was looking for a listing of all data on all dom elements, similar to the listing of cookies, but if not your method is fine
[00:21:20] <dblosevn> derelict: I dont think you can do that, pretty sure you have to target an element to get .data
[00:21:46] <dblosevn> not sure how it would posibly format it if not
[00:21:58] <derelict> dblosevn: gotcha
[00:44:41] <Jee5us_w> Hey, guys! Has anyone sorted dom elements alphabetically by the text value? I'm trying to do something like this, but can't figure out a decent way...
[00:59:20] <dblosevn> ?g jquery sort by text plugin @ Jee5us_w

[01:41:01] <benj3> Does any one know of a way to bind mousewheel down mousewheel up?
[01:41:45] <dblosevn> benj3: you need jquery.mousewheel.js
[01:41:48] <iSeeDeadPixels> why is this ( http://jsfiddle.net/tQRQn/1/ ) happening? :c
[01:42:32] <iSeeDeadPixels> try to drag one of the red computer square thingies

[01:43:10] <dblosevn> np
[01:44:01] <benj3> Whats wrong with it pixels?
[01:44:34] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: try to drag one of those pc thingies
[01:44:34] <benj3> Mine drags, drops perfectly fine?
[01:44:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> on chrome?
[01:44:44] <benj3> yer
[01:44:59] <dblosevn> ya works great
[01:45:09] <dblosevn> dropped in the gray box
[01:45:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> not there

[01:45:29] <iSeeDeadPixels> try to rearrange them
[01:46:07] <dblosevn> oh nice
[01:46:17] <dblosevn> goes to bottom of the list
[01:46:18] <benj3> ah ok
[01:46:20] <benj3> yer
[01:46:26] <benj3> thats normal drag and drop behaviour
[01:46:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> it shouldn't do that :C
[01:47:12] <iSeeDeadPixels> it should like, work like it should, if i want to drop anywhere, then let me drop anywhere
[01:47:47] <benj3> try this

[01:50:27] <[Jasper]> hej guys, I have a question about namespaces...if I include 2 .js files in my website... how can I make sure they can use variables defined in the other file?
[01:50:43] <[Jasper]> or isn't this possible at all?
[01:50:56] <dblosevn> dont namespace the vars
[01:51:08] <[Jasper]> can't I create my own namespace?
[01:51:11] <[Jasper]> where I put everything in?
[01:51:14] <dblosevn> or store a reference to each files namespace
[01:51:35] <dblosevn> to keep the vars out of the global scope
[01:51:50] <Drager> If I have a .fadeToggle() how can I save that state the div was in when the user last toggled?
[01:52:08] <Drager> When he/she chagne page
[01:52:25] <dblosevn> cookie would be about the only way

[02:03:38] <Drager> Hm
[02:04:57] <dblosevn> ?
[02:05:28] <miblon> I am having difficulties passing a "parent" javascript object in a function (method) that has a jQuery click event that should call a function in the parent object..
[02:05:37] <miblon> Some example code is here: http://pastebin.com/5WhLXus6
[02:05:41] <dblosevn> wow lol
[02:06:00] <dblosevn> need some coffee after reading that lmao
[02:06:26] <miblon> the problem is in line 16 where this is the jQuery object and not it's parent
[02:06:39] <miblon> How can I propagate the parent to the click event?
[02:06:41] <sacho> var that = this before registering the click event, then use that
[02:06:51] <miblon> sacho, thanks!
[02:06:54] <miblon> Will try
[02:07:18] <Drager> dblosevn: Not sure how to accomplish it.
[02:07:29] <dblosevn> ++sacho
[02:08:05] <dblosevn> Drager: what do you mean? show me some code
[02:08:10] <[Jasper]> guys...when I create a variable which is like windows.test = variable
[02:08:16] <dblosevn> ?demo @ Drager
[02:08:27] <dblosevn> bot-t: imma beat you
[02:08:29] <[Jasper]> window is a default browser namespace I suppose?
[02:08:30] <Drager> dblosevn: On it
[02:08:46] <dblosevn> window is the global namespace
[02:09:01] <dblosevn> var a = 1; is the same as var window.a = 1;
[02:09:16] <sacho> assuming you're not in function scope
[02:09:22] <dblosevn> well yes
[02:09:58] <dblosevn> you do want to try to keep the global scope as clean as possible though as you will run into problems if yyou dont
[02:10:11] <Work> hi all
[02:10:18] <Drager> dblosevn: https://pastee.org/8zn5y
[02:10:35] <dblosevn> eg with loops that call functions that have loops using the same iterator in both if scoped globally will cause a logic error
[02:11:29] <[Jasper]> yeah dblosevn that's what I figured...I'm trying to solve this problem I'm having...I have a few seperate .js files.....I want certain variable to be shared throught these .js files..
[02:11:36] <[Jasper]> so I want to have my own namespace to put them in
[02:11:43] <[Jasper]> I'm trying to figure out how I can set this up to work\
[02:12:04] <dblosevn> well namespace each file and store a reference to each namespace
[02:12:15] <dblosevn> in the gloabl namespace
[02:12:21] <[Jasper]> can't I give them all the same namespace?
[02:12:44] <dblosevn> well by default they all have the same namespace provided you havent given them there own
[02:12:47] <K3|Chris> btw anyone spotted a browsershots.org like service for handhelds? I only find iOS "emulators" that do the job by giving you an iFrame the same size as an iPhone's screen, which doesn't work the same at all
[02:13:06] <[Jasper]> you mean the global namespace dblosevn ?
[02:13:07] <K3|Chris> iPhone zooms out by default to not scroll sideways for one
[02:13:20] <dblosevn> yes [Jasper]
[02:13:44] <benj3> You ever used this mousescroll plugin 007?
[02:14:04] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: what did you change?
[02:14:41] <benj3> I just got rid of your left box and removed the margin and absolute positioning on the container
[02:15:02] <iSeeDeadPixels> well, that's not the solution i am looking for ><
[02:15:15] <benj3> Your using absolute positioning too much
[02:15:43] <dblosevn> benj3: ya its pretty simple
[02:16:23] <iYuri> guys, I just downloaded a context menu plugin and I was able to make it work properly! Now, when elements are added via jquery to the list of elems where the menu should work, the menu does not appear
[02:16:41] <dblosevn> benj3: bouth wheel up and down are the same event
[02:16:47] <iYuri> is there a way to use $(".menu").contextMenu({...}); with .live() ??
[02:17:29] <dblosevn> benj3: http://pastebin.com/L1V9ixG2
[02:19:08] <[Jasper]> so dblosevn ...if I add this in my first .js file ... window.MYNAMESPACE = {};
[02:19:25] <[Jasper]> I can then add variables by doing MYNAMESPACE.test = 'test'; ?
[02:19:35] <benj3> aye i got that 007
[02:19:35] <[Jasper]> which would then be accessiable everywhere right?
[02:19:50] <benj3> im trying to define when its up and down
[02:19:56] <benj3> and say if up do this if down do this
[02:20:01] <fotoflo> Quick spamy post (sorry) -- I just posted "Facebook wouldn't let me invite my friends... jQuery to the rescue! " on hacker newsâ€¦ any query fans, please vote me up :-)
[02:20:07] <fotoflo> http://news.ycombinator.com/newest
[02:20:16] <dblosevn> if (dir == 'Up')
[02:20:27] <dblosevn> or if (delta > 0) //is up
[02:20:46] <benj3> i did if (dir != 1)
[02:20:47] <Drager> dblosevn: Any thoughts?
[02:20:54] <benj3> but that does it for up and down
[02:20:59] <dblosevn> Drager: still looking
[02:21:06] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: actually, that's only for the fiddle.
[02:21:28] <benj3> yer, the problem lies within the connector box ^
[02:21:38] <dblosevn> .bind('mousewheel', function(event, delta) {
[02:21:39] <dblosevn>             var dir = delta > 0 ? 'Up' : 'Down',
[02:21:51] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: connector box?
[02:21:53] <dblosevn> dir would be 'Up' or 'Down'
[02:22:22] <dblosevn> delta is not 0 -1 or 1
[02:22:31] <dblosevn> delta has the inertia as well
[02:23:06] <Shucky> hi all
[02:23:08] <dblosevn> faster they flip the wheel the greater the delta
[02:23:12] <MrDup> Hi all
[02:23:19] <benj3> Yer, http://pastebin.com/x06ucA3Y
[02:23:25] <benj3> but it doesnt work =p
[02:23:38] <Shucky> someone know if a plugin exist to do this http://visibletweets.com/#query=Apple&animation=1 in jquery?
[02:23:57] <benj3> @iSeeDeadPixels the box where your dragging the elements too is the cause
[02:24:01] <fotoflo> [jasper]:  if you just do MYnamespace = new Object()
[02:24:13] <fotoflo> its in the global namespace so then you can do MYnamespace.farts = "smelly"
[02:24:15] <fotoflo> [6:24pm]
[02:24:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> how can it be?
[02:24:23] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: please elaborate?
[02:24:42] <benj3> If you remove that box
[02:24:50] <benj3> the drag and drop is working perfectly
[02:24:52] <iSeeDeadPixels> i do not want to remove the box
[02:24:55] <benj3> I know
[02:24:59] <benj3> but thats where the cause lies
[02:25:03] <iSeeDeadPixels> do you have a solution for me?
[02:25:07] <benj3> not yet
[02:25:28] <MrDup> I have doubt about something : I would like to send form datas and files using ajax method. Can I do it all in one ajax call ? Or do I have to make one call to send form datas and another one to send files ?
[02:28:02] <iSeeDeadPixels> MrDup: uhh, googled that already??

[02:29:33] <Cristen> Hi everyone, I wondered if there's a way to prevent other javascript functions execution when one's already triggered ? I made a menu that displays a loading image and then slideDown the content, but if I click quickly enough on two items, it slides the 2 blocks which is a problem ...
[02:29:41] <benj3> @iSeeDeadPixels : http://jsfiddle.net/tQRQn/13/
[02:29:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> 13?!
[02:30:03] <benj3> You see?
[02:30:12] <dblosevn> benj3: http://jsfiddle.net/nHW27/1/ why not?
[02:30:22] <dblosevn> [Jasper]: im gettin close
[02:30:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> benj3: now i can't drag stuff back into the grid :C
[02:31:49] <benj3> iSeeDeadPixel : http://jsfiddle.net/tQRQn/14/
[02:31:58] <benj3> Hmm Strang 007 ill have a play ty
[02:33:21] <dblosevn> [Jasper]: http://pastebin.com/v056RQhf
[02:34:54] <[Jasper]> dblosevn ?
[02:35:07] <[Jasper]> what am I supposed to do with that?
[02:35:16] <[Jasper]> 8)
[02:35:36] <dblosevn> [Jasper]: that properly sets the cookie
[02:35:52] <dblosevn> so you know if its state was open or closed last
[02:36:56] <[Jasper]> dblosevn I think this is meant for someone else
[02:37:02] <dblosevn> but this only works if theres only one .staff-titebar
[02:37:07] <dblosevn> ut oh
[02:37:08] <dblosevn> lol
[02:37:55] <dblosevn> @ Drager sorry
[02:37:56] <Cristen> how to prevent other jquery functions execution so that 2 functions can't fire at the same time ?
[02:38:16] <dblosevn> [Jasper]: what was your question cant find it
[02:38:37] <Cork> Cristen: set a lock variable and check that at the beginning of the functions
[02:40:01] <Cristen> thx Cork didn't thought of that solution!
[02:40:56] <Drager> dblosevn: There's just one
[02:42:44] <dblosevn> [Jasper]: http://pastebin.com/GrMx0r1S that ones really for you
[02:42:55] <MrDup> iSeeDeadPixels: I already saw this one. but in this example, there's only files, not form datas and files.
[02:43:59] <MrDup> Does FormData object manage both ?
[02:44:00] <mongag> What is wrong with this code - http://jsfiddle.net/RmhuH/1/
[02:44:01] <mongag> ?
[02:44:14] <mongag> alert shows empty string instead of 1 or 2
[02:46:55] <dblosevn> Drager: http://pastebin.com/d8CVZ0eZ
[02:48:44] <dblosevn> mongag: no clue without seeing the response from controller.php
[02:50:20] <Drager> dblosevn: Works like a charm. Thank you! :)
[02:50:28] <dblosevn> np
[02:50:44] <mongag> dvlosevn i think the problem comes from the variables scope..
[02:50:59] <Cristen> Cork, my functions end so quickly that the lock is already reset to 0 before the second click and so the lock is useless for the second function, do I need to delay the lock = false ?
[02:51:11] <mongag> when i do alert($x) within the if/else statement it shows the values 1 and 2
[02:51:29] <Cork> Cristen: you need to delay it until you want to allow it again :)
[02:51:38] <Cork> Cristen: and that might be for an ajax call to end
[02:51:42] <Cork> or with a timer
[02:51:46] <ItsJustMe> I want to filter some divs and use the html5 data attr. for that .. Everything works fine, but know I want to filter with a dropdown (select) and Firefox sais the attribute shouldn't be used, because it's everytime true. But if I alert the value it's 0 .. http://jsfiddle.net/GatheringXP/bsbaQ/
[02:51:52] <Cork> depending on what you're doing
[02:51:58] <dblosevn> mongag: ... i didnt see that the alert is being called before you recieve the callback from controllere.php
[02:52:00] <Cristen> timer on this case
[02:52:38] <dblosevn> mongag: put the alert inside the callback and it will work just fine
[02:53:30] <mongag> dblosevn: i know but i want to keep the value of $x outside of the $.post scope
[02:53:50] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you don't have any offer_webspace class in that fiddle
[02:53:54] <dblosevn> mongag: so scope $x outside of the callback
[02:54:25] <ItsJustMe> Okay, I'll add one .. But I thought it wouldn't be needed ..
[02:54:40] <Cork> ItsJustMe: but the checks happen in the filter
[02:54:46] <Cork> and as there never a loop...
[02:54:51] <mongag> dblosevn correct. i need the value of $x outside of the callback
[02:54:55] <Cork> ItsJustMe: or was the problem somewhere else?
[02:55:16] <ItsJustMe> The problem is that I cannot filter for the data-attribute called partner-id ..
[02:55:38] <ItsJustMe> The inputs work fine, but if I want to filter with that dropdown called select_partner nothing happens
[02:55:49] <dblosevn> mongag: http://jsfiddle.net/RmhuH/3/ like so
[02:55:56] <ItsJustMe> And Firefox sais the value of input_partner is everytime true =/
[02:56:45] <Cork> ItsJustMe: what does input_partner have to do with it?
[02:56:52] <Cork> thats just a static string
[02:57:02] <ItsJustMe> it's a variable o.ô
[02:57:15] <ItsJustMe> the first one ..
[02:57:27] <Cork> ya, ut its set before you do anything with the data calls
[02:57:33] <Cork> so what's the connection?
[02:57:51] <dblosevn> Cork++ lol
[02:58:05] <grek2> hy flowplayer dont play .flv files ?
[02:58:25] <ItsJustMe> okay, I don't understand you ._. What connection?
[02:58:36] <dblosevn> grek2: your implementation of it, it plays .flv just fine
[02:58:42] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you said that partner-id fails, and that input_partner is true
[02:58:53] <Cork> but as you save the result of the selectbox before you do anything
[02:59:02] <Cork> what does the two have to do with each other?
[02:59:09] <Cork> as you're code doesn't run i can't test it to see
[02:59:15] <grek2> so how to play  - i add <source type="video/flash" src"/media/Royal720x396.flv"/> and have failure
[02:59:26] <grek2> other formats works withou problems
[02:59:34] <dblosevn> grek2: thats not flowplayer
[02:59:53] <ItsJustMe> May I pm you Cork?
[03:00:01] <dblosevn> grek2: thats html video
[03:00:05] <Cork> preferably not
[03:00:09] <ItsJustMe> okay
[03:00:15] <mongag> dblosevn not working i get 0 as result instead of 1 or 2
[03:00:18] <grek2> this is in <div class="player flowplayer2 first-frame "> <video><source type="video/flash" src"/media/Royal720x396.flv"/> and have failure
[03:00:20] <dblosevn> *html5 video
[03:00:51] <grek2> yes i know but overload by flowplyaer i think but .flv not
[03:00:58] <dblosevn> grek2: you cant let flowplayer use html5 video for flv
[03:01:36] <dblosevn> grek2: it has to use the flowplayer flash player as the browser doesnt have codecs to display flv
[03:02:34] <dblosevn> mongag: then you didnt use the setTimeout or the callback takes longer then 5 seconds to complete
[03:02:35] <grek2> but this is not auto select?  i have flash in this firefox browser ubuntu
[03:02:53] <grek2> i must chech manualy ?
[03:02:59] <grek2> check
[03:03:10] <dblosevn> you must not use html5 with .flv
[03:03:23] <ItsJustMe> Cork: I have got some inputs and a select .. Everything you see in the javascript section, is in a function which is called after every change of input or select value, so that the filter got updated. That works totally fine. But on pageload Firefox sais that input_partner, the var that contains the select-value, is everytime true. But it is 0 always. And now I try to get the select value (#select_partner), compare
[03:03:23] <ItsJustMe>  it with the data-attribute "partner-id" and filter if it is not matching.
[03:03:32] <ItsJustMe> Did you understand? o.o
[03:04:02] <grek2> dblosevn : ok thanks
[03:04:12] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you're sure you run the code after the dom is parsed and ready?
[03:04:31] <Cork> and are you going back to it through the back history?
[03:04:33] <ItsJustMe> I call this function firstly on document ready()
[03:04:41] <dblosevn> grek2: while you can use x outside of the callback you oviously cant use it before the callback has completed
[03:05:10] <Cork> ItsJustMe: and where do you have the dom ready code?
[03:05:11] <dblosevn> crap *@ mongag
[03:05:17] <Cork> in head or at the bottom of the page or where?
[03:06:20] <mongag> dblosevn: thanks it's working now
[03:06:28] <dblosevn> np
[03:07:48] <ItsJustMe> Cork: Send you link in pm ..
[03:09:28] <MrDup> Nobody have a clue for my question ?
[03:09:34] <ItsJustMe> Cork: did you receive it?
[03:09:47] <Cork> i have pm disabled so no
[03:10:16] <ItsJustMe> But I don't want to spread the page =/
[03:10:29] <Cork> i won't have time to dig through a site url anyway
[03:10:57] <ItsJustMe> It is only one page - Only the needed parts ^^
[03:11:12] <ItsJustMe> With one js-block at the bottom
[03:12:47] <dblosevn> hey Cork who can reboot bot-t?
[03:12:58] <dblosevn> he dided bout an hour or so ago
[03:13:36] <grass7boy> hello?
[03:13:54] <gear4> hi
[03:14:05] <grass7boy> i want to using $.getScript and cache the result script file
[03:14:18] <grass7boy> i ve read the doc
[03:14:47] <Cork> dblosevn: its run by temp01
[03:15:01] <Cork> so it will be down until he notices it
[03:15:12] <dblosevn> oh well lol
[03:15:43] <grass7boy> wait..
[03:15:52] <grass7boy> i have a typo error
[03:16:01] <grass7boy> what stupid i am
[03:16:45] <da-beginner> hi all.. can someone tell me the jquery plugin used for the layover when you hover the images in this site? http://themeforest.net/item/rockefeller-flexible-multipurpose-wp-theme/full_screen_preview/3363476
[03:18:15] <grass7boy> ok ... i ve got a problem
[03:18:18] <grass7boy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/#caching-requests
[03:18:35] <grass7boy> this page tell us to cache the script file from $.getScript
[03:18:58] <grass7boy> just using $.ajaxSetup({
[03:18:59] <grass7boy>   cache: true
[03:19:01] <grass7boy> });
[03:19:12] <grass7boy> the question is ...
[03:19:44] <grass7boy> is there any way to tell $.getScript that cache the result script file AT THIS TIME
[03:20:02] <grass7boy> and it will not cache if i invoke another $.getScript
[03:21:13] <grass7boy> rather than using $.ajaxSetup({cache: true/false}) before/after every $.getScript
[03:22:45] <dblosevn> grass7boy: read the docs
[03:22:56] <grass7boy> sorry
[03:22:59] <grass7boy> i ve found
[03:23:07] <grass7boy> next section

[04:01:16] <faraway> Krambiorix: my guess get_events does not return anything anymore ... or you striped out a relevant part of the code ;)
[04:01:47] <Krambiorix> faraway, nope
[04:01:53] <Krambiorix> faraway, it does
[04:03:30] <Krambiorix> faraway, if i do: esource.events = get_events(data.id,pevents) , it works , but i want esource = get_events....
[04:06:13] <faraway> Krambiorix: well then you have something like esource = {}Â in between do a console.dir right after the get_events like here http://pastebin.com/KCTS7hhb
[04:08:17] <Krambiorix> faraway, esource = {}  -> works!!!

[04:26:34] <hyper_ch> hi there, I currently use jqueryui tabs and jqueryui dialog. With the tabs I am able to load content from a different page with ajax quite nicely. However the problem I experience is, that then the links from those ajaxed pages won't open up in a dialog box
[04:30:49] <[Jasper]> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13529178/namespacing-events-backbone
[04:30:57] <[Jasper]> maybe someone can help me with that problem?
[04:31:55] <matteu> Jasper:  This channel is #jquery, discussion on backbone.js is off topic.
[04:32:17] <matteu> Jasper: Try #documentcloud
[04:32:26] <[Jasper]> sorry matteu, I thought it might be a general namespacing issue
[04:33:11] <simenbrekken> I've created a factory method for creating <select> options which I'm calling with $('.container').append($('option').map(create)) but I'm getting "NOT_FOUND_ERR DOM Exception 8". I've resolved it by returning $element.get() from the factory method but I was wondering if there's a better way of doing this kind of thing
[04:35:28] <matteu> simenbrekken:  jQuery's DOM manipulation abilities are pretty straightforward, and you're approaching them correctly.  You might try 1) server side frameworks, 2) a jQuery plugin or library like jQuery++, or 3) some sort of front-end framework to complement jQuery.
[04:35:58] <simenbrekken> matteu: could you possibly answer my question with something less random? :D
[04:36:03] <simenbrekken> server side frameworks?
[04:37:14] <matteu> simenbrekken: Server side frameworks:  Django, Ruby on Rails, CodeIgniter, Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal
[04:37:26] <simenbrekken> matteu: which relates to my problem in what way?
[04:38:29] <matteu> simenbrekken:  That's up to you, but generating html like form elements is usually a feature in the model->view->template flow of these technologies
[04:39:55] <simenbrekken> matteu: My question has nothing to do with form elements, it has to do with efficient element creation in jquery
[04:56:09] <grek2> mayby sombady know Flowplayer 5 can play .flv ?
[04:56:58] <grek2> i must gone, back later :)
[04:57:12] <hyper_ch> after the page loaded and you pull in some new content with ajax, how can you make sure that  $(function() { .... } is being run on that new content also?
[05:04:25] <itatitat> Guys I've this problem, is not working, I don' know why, is a very simple code http://jsfiddle.net/END44/
[05:04:30] <itatitat> I explain it in the same code (3 lines of code...very small)
[05:07:39] <itatitat> someone can help me with that?
[05:08:42] <t432> The "label" and "value" are outpuuting the same value in console.log 	$('#Field').autocomplete({source: base_uri,response:function(e,ui){console.log(ui.content);}
[05:08:42] <t432> should be in format: value="foo" label="12"
[05:10:23] <itatitat> t432: can you help me with this problem? http://jsfiddle.net/END44/
[05:14:14] <Goggles> Hey All
[05:14:59] <seutje> itatitat: u has a syntax error : http://jsfiddle.net/END44/1/
[05:15:59] <seutje> itatitat: also, toggleClass doesn't work like you seem to think it does ?see toggleClass
[05:16:23] <seutje> itatitat: see ?toggleClass
[05:16:23] <bot-t> itatitat, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[05:17:27] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmmmm, okok, I'll try
[05:17:29] <itatitat> thanks a lot
[05:18:41] <itatitat> ok, but at least I'm passing the argumens selector fine to the function no?
[05:18:53] <Goggles> Would anyone know where i could find some 'ardcore jquery programmers for some freelance work?
[05:20:25] <seutje> itatitat: well it is a bit silly the way u did it
[05:20:34] <itatitat> really??
[05:20:35] <seutje> itatitat: not sure if this is the order u wanted it in: http://jsfiddle.net/END44/2/
[05:20:40] <itatitat> ou
[05:20:55] <seutje> lol, forgot to remove the // not zorking
[05:20:58] <seutje> working*
[05:21:12] <matteu> suetje:  It's probably not zorking either.
[05:21:53] <itatitat> jummm, okok, but wow.........I saw like my way sometimes....really I used to make it, but was some months ago
[05:21:59] <itatitat> I don't remember exactly
[05:22:47] <seutje> matteu: switching back and forth between apple qwerty, apple azerty and regular belgian azerty fucks with my head sometimes :P
[05:34:06] <Birliban> Hi, I'm lookin for a kind of autocomplete, but not with a popup but with a select field with attribute size="10". so when i type into input field the select should fill with matching values. is there any plugin for this?
[05:36:43] <karstenk1977_> Hello
[05:36:52] <dennyb> hey
[05:37:25] <karstenk1977_> I know, thats not the channel for Illustrator, but is there someone who can help me by a little path subtraction?
[05:43:16] <ved_1> Birliban: jquery autocomplete doesnt help u?
[05:48:45] <aqeel> hi room
[05:49:29] <aqeel> how can i add fade effect to my page after certain element is loaded into the page
[05:49:51] <aqeel> on some pages it is working for others it is not
[05:54:51] <scalability-junk> hey I'm trying around with jquery ui and the autocomplete widget and I can't get how to add an additional item to the suggestions list.
[05:55:24] <matteu> aqueel: What are you trying now?
[05:55:26] <scalability-junk> I can add an item with jquery when the open event is fired, but I also need the item to be shown when the autocomplete has no results...
[05:55:59] <scalability-junk> is there a way to always open the menu and therefore trigger the open event, even when the autocomplete doesn't find any results?
[05:57:12] <scalability-junk> or would the easiest solution be to use the source list and handle these no results suggestions serverside and send it as result to the client?
[05:59:51] <aqeel> i want to fade out the tips div but not on window load but rather after an element is loaded, completed...]
[06:02:08] <matteu> aqeel:  I understand that, can you provide an example of what you're trying now?  http://jsfiddle.net
[06:02:39] <aqeel> ok...wait please
[06:11:40] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Uzc3R/
[06:11:47] <aqeel> this is my entire page code...
[06:13:16] <aqeel> i want the hidetips() function called somewhere when customalert function finishes
[06:13:36] <aqeel> on index page works but othere pages it is not working
[06:14:10] <aqeel> in fiddle i have removed the function where i had placed.....
[06:17:05] <izual> Hi, I want to call some server side script with ajax through jquery and want to get some js code back to execute, how is this possible?
[06:17:22] <aqeel> ajax()
[06:17:38] <Birliban> ved_1, sorry, saw it too late.. no jquerui just provides the popup solution...
[06:18:14] <ved_1> you can customize it
[06:18:54] <aqeel> izual: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:19:20] <Birliban> Birliban, yes, customize but i think now building the wanted feature myself will do the job too.
[06:19:47] <aqeel> matteu: seeing my code?
[06:21:25] <matteu> aqueel: just a second
[06:24:22] <matteu> aqueel:  Can you please remove the extraneous code and provide me with a fiddle just demonstrating what you're trying to do?
[06:25:17] <aqeel> howabout live site...
[06:29:58] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[06:30:17] <aqeel> the tips div is i would like to have it faded
[06:31:43] <izual> aqeel, I am setting the dataType expected to script, but I don't understand HOW I can execute the code
[06:33:30] <aqeel> izual fiddle?
[06:34:31] <ItsJustMe> I do not really know where to ask, so I'll try it here .. Do you know where I could find a mentor for javascript and jquery? Someone who is that bored to help me out when I am stucking and cannot go further? ^^ I would really love to learn it, but I can't when I only have documentations and tutorials. Don't know why =/
[06:35:19] <shoky> izual: the code is executed for you
[06:36:07] <izual> so from the server side I just echo the code and it gets executed at the client without any further action?
[06:36:27] <matteu> aqeel:  The live site is worse.  I need you to construct a fiddle that demonstrates the basic concept of what you're trying to do.  It will be less time than me trying to figure out what you're trying to do from your entire codebase.
[06:36:48] <shoky> izual: yes, just like any <script> tag
[06:38:03] <izual> thanks :)
[06:38:20] <aqeel> matteu: let me do a case for it...
[06:38:53] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a way to get load to just return what it finds? kinda like var html = $.load('/some-page.html #my-elem-i-want')?
[06:42:20] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Uzc3R/2/
[06:42:30] <aqeel> matteu: ^^
[06:43:06] <shoky> EdwardIII:  $.get('/some-page.html').done(function(html) { var elem = $('<div>').append(html).find('#my-elem-i-want'); ...do stuff with elem... })
[06:43:06] <aqeel> use funhction() within load();
[06:43:29] <grek2> hy, any know is possible to play .flv video in flowplayer5 ? i dont understand flowplayer 4 and flowplayer5 is other --products so why have same name,
[06:43:56] <aqeel> sorry wrong room grek2
[06:44:22] <shoky> dono if that'll work good if there are scripts tho, might run em or someshit
[06:44:34] <aqeel> by the way .flv can be played by real player
[06:44:47] <grek2> why wrong room
[06:44:52] <grek2> ? its jquery
[06:45:05] <aqeel> are yiou using actionscript or javascript
[06:45:11] <bot-t> grek2, jQuery Mobile | jQuery Mobile - http://jquerymobile.com/
[06:45:30] <grek2> i need on page haved before flowplyayer 3 and flv and ok
[06:45:53] <grek2> now i add mp4 videos witch html5 and flowplyaer5 but cant playay old ldv
[06:45:58] <grek2> flv
[06:46:08] <grek2> javascript and jquery
[06:46:17] <aqeel> may be new script have updated function reference code
[06:46:19] <grek2> i place on page videos
[06:46:45] <grek2> yes its updated and its new player to other files but same name
[06:46:48] <aqeel> like jquery 1.8 is major update....
[06:46:51] <grek2> creazy
[06:47:54] <aqeel> maybe some deprecated codes have been removed
[06:47:56] <grek2> http://flash.flowplayer.org/forum/8/104166 ) flowplayer 5 is not an upgrade to flowplayer 3.2 , it is a separate product. you cannot interchange the setups
[06:48:03] <matteu> aqeel:  You could try calling $(elem).show(0, function() { // code after elem shows });
[06:48:23] <grek2> so why have same name i must show flv fmovies on page and html movies
[06:48:30] <grek2> html5 formats ogv
[06:48:53] <matteu> aqeel:  In other words, call the show function with 0 transition time (show immediately) and use the callback function to do what you want after jQuery assures you that the element's show behavior has completed
[06:48:57] <aqeel> matteu: its shown but i want to hide
[06:49:24] <matteu> aqeel:  So use hide() instead
[06:49:49] <aqeel> $(elem).fadeOut(0, function() { // code after elem shows });<-------------some thing like this
[06:50:43] <matteu> aqeel:  That would work too
[06:50:57] <matteu> aqeel:  Any function that has callback behavior, really
[06:51:41] <aqeel> let me see...
[06:51:44] <aqeel> thanks
[06:54:40] <EdwardIII> shoky: thanks!
[07:05:04] <aqeel> matteu: function(){$("#customalert").load(function () { $("#tips").fadeOut("slow"); });}
[07:05:57] <aqeel> is there any other way to see if a div or any element have loaded....insteaD OF USING LOAD()
[07:10:42] <shoky> aqeel: i don't think .load can be used for divs..
[07:11:08] <aqeel> any alternative
[07:11:22] <aqeel> specific way to see if element exists
[07:16:41] <shoky> exists?
[07:16:55] <shoky> $(selector).length > 0
[07:16:55] <halcyon1234> $(selector).length > 0
[07:16:59] <halcyon1234> ha
[07:17:00] <shoky> ;p
[07:17:08] <aqeel> function hidetips(){ if("#customalert:visible"){$("#tips").fadeOut("slow");}}
[07:17:11] <ItsJustMe> How can I set an event handler to belate added divs?
[07:17:34] <aqeel> use on( )  ItsJustMe
[07:17:50] <shoky> ItsJustMe: delegate to some container element, using .on
[07:18:38] <ItsJustMe2> I have tried .. But it do not work =(
[07:18:49] <shoky> e.g. $('#container').on('click', '.addedDiv', function(e) { ... })
[07:19:00] <aqeel> may be you are ataching from wrong place...
[07:19:25] <shoky> ?demo
[07:19:26] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:19:28] <aqeel> common mistake mostly make is using the within container...try to use the top most container...
[07:19:35] <ItsJustMe2> could someone kick me (itsjustme) out?
[07:19:40] <ItsJustMe2> so i can join again?
[07:20:13] <shoky> if it's a registered nick, you can ghost it
[07:20:29] <ItsJustMe2> that means?
[07:20:34] <shoky> /msg nickserv ghost ItsJustMe password_here
[07:20:41] <ItsJustMe2> okay :)
[07:21:19] <ItsJustMe2> thx shoky :)
[07:21:30] <shoky> ;]
[07:21:38] <ItsJustMe> Back :D
[07:22:02] <aqeel> u got fiddle of your problem
[07:22:26] <ItsJustMe> aqeel: do you mean me?
[07:22:48] <aqeel> yes
[07:22:56] <ItsJustMe> one moment pls
[07:24:33] <ItsJustMe> is it also okay if I send you the link to my page?

[08:14:08] <Birliban> hi, could someone have a look @ http://jsfiddle.net/r4CQ7/1/ problem in comments...
[08:16:31] <faraway> Birliban: http://jsfiddle.net/r4CQ7/2/
[08:18:17] <faraway> Birliban: you got the beginning and the end markers (  ^  and $  )
[08:19:59] <Birliban> ahhh, i see, that easy ;-) thank you a lot!
[08:22:44] <faraway> Birliban: well regex are alway a little bit tricky at the beginning
[08:23:50] <grafi> and at the middle ^^
[08:28:21] <ShawnRisk> What is wrong with this code: $html .= '<script> $(".wpbdp-form-field-1").before("<div id="basic"><a href="#basic">Basic</a></div>");</script>';?
[08:28:47] <systemfault> Why donâ€™t you try the damn PHP channel?
[08:28:58] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: your quoting
[08:29:02] <ZadYree> or perl :P
[08:29:03] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: get a decent editor
[08:29:15] <ShawnRisk> I fixed it
[08:29:22] <NoiseEee> ^^ that is not fixed quoting
[08:29:43] <NoiseEee> before("<div id="basic">  would be highlighted by any decent editor
[08:30:03] <ShawnRisk> I fixed it in my code
[08:30:12] <ShawnRisk> it is <div id=\"basic\"
[08:30:23] <ShawnRisk> how do I make this only happen once?
[08:30:34] <NoiseEee> whatever you typed above is wrong. isnt that your code? if not why did you paste it?
[08:31:44] <ShawnRisk> this is the new code: $html .= '<script> $(".wpbdp-form-field-1").before("<h3 id=\"basic\"><a href=\"#basic\">Basic</a></h3>");</script>';
[08:32:00] <NoiseEee> what's the code rendered by your browser?
[08:32:07] <NoiseEee> i don't really care about this php stuff
[08:32:30] <ShawnRisk> okay fine
[08:47:44] <docmur> I'm trying to grab the value from a set of three radio buttons but I cna't seem to get the code to work: http://jsfiddle.net/qYmbt/21/
[08:56:45] <Saaether> docmur http://jsfiddle.net/qYmbt/23/
[08:57:35] <docmur> thanks ....
[08:57:43] <docmur> Why can I just do reason.val()
[08:57:49] <docmur> shouldn't it be the samething?
[08:57:55] <Saaether> reason is already the value
[08:58:21] <docmur> I know but when I do var reason = $(input. ..) then later on shouldn't reason.val() retrieve the value?
[08:59:15] <Saaether> if you did var reason  =$(input) then reason is the html object, then you could use reason.val()
[08:59:25] <Saaether> but in your case you set reason to the value
[08:59:31] <docmur> okay
[09:52:46] <DrShoggoth> If I have filtered using $('.someclass') and then I .parent().parent(),  how do I get ALL children unfiltered of the returned element?
[09:53:24] <DrShoggoth> what I am looking for is $('.someclass').parent().parent().allMyChildrens()
[09:53:47] <Caelum> so I bound keypress to $(document), but when I type something into an input and press enter, it does nothing, only when I press enter a second time does the event fire
[09:55:40] <Caelum> DrShoggoth: .parent().parent().find('*')
[09:56:50] <DrShoggoth> tyvm
[10:15:59] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, anyone uses jquery mobile for simple mobile site?
[10:16:26] <jarr0dsz> i make one for a freind of mine but have problem, seems that every single page that opens does not load my JS files in the head ( some custom photo plugin i included )
[10:52:33] <dailylinux> Would like to know how sites implement menu with scrolling down to a specific part of the page (a div i guess)?
[10:54:22] <ravenzz> add an id to the target element, say #foo, and set the link href to "#foo"
[10:54:45] <ravenzz> if you want the fancy smooth scolling down, you'd need to add some js
[10:56:49] <spobat> hey
[10:56:55] <spobat> what am I missing in here?
[10:56:55] <spobat> http://ideone.com/rh8a1v
[10:57:01] <spobat>  / what is the best way to solve this?
[10:57:38] <spobat> I basically want to set the 'normal' images if the first one is one of the dark ones
[10:58:51] <dblosevn> spobat: presentationBoxItems. // you never give a member
[10:59:07] <spobat> ?
[10:59:50] <dblosevn> spobat: that is a syntax error, it should be something like, presentationBoxItems.something
[11:00:01] <truedon> Hey guys can anyone help, I am doing a vertical infinite carousel loop with jcarousel and a ul, li structure. It is working pretty good but as you can see here http://gript.co.uk/temp/ if you click on nav item 9 the list will start disappearing and not come back, its very strange. It is if something is wrong with the jcarousel or jquery and I am not sure how I can fix this
[11:00:01] <spobat> I know.
[11:00:06] <spobat> the question was what to put there.
[11:00:08] <spobat> :)
[11:00:13] <dblosevn> oh lol
[11:00:24] <dblosevn> Thought the question was why you got a syntax error lmao
[11:00:24] <JessC> @Caelum do you have a fiddle for this?
[11:00:37] <spobat> okay, sorry
[11:00:48] <spobat> I think i was looking for .each()
[11:02:33] <dblosevn> spobat: $('#presentationBox	> img').each (function () {	this.url = this.url.replace('-dark.png', '');});
[11:02:36] <Caelum> JessC: after asking on #javascript, I changed it to .bind('keyup' and that works correctly
[11:03:07] <spobat> dblosevn, nice!
[11:03:12] <dblosevn> sorry this.src
[11:03:16] <spobat> I almost ended up in the same, that makes me feel lucky
[11:03:32] <spobat> for the record _ http://ideone.com/IveZI0
[11:03:50] <spobat> is `this` the same as $(this) ?
[11:03:57] <spobat> this *
[11:03:59] <dblosevn> that does nothing
[11:04:04] <JLT> If $(".snippet-num").children() has a list of li's, how would I add a selected class to the 8th li?
[11:04:07] <dblosevn> this is not the same as $(this)
[11:04:25] <dblosevn> this is an element reference $(this) is a jQobj
[11:04:49] <spobat> ah, okay
[11:04:54] <dblosevn> no need to do all that attr crap either if you already have a direct reference to the element
[11:05:35] <spobat> okay
[11:05:38] <dblosevn> img.src = img.src.replace('-dark.png', '-light.png');
[11:06:35] <dblosevn> no need in the extra work for jquery to have to lookup though attrs :-)
[11:06:56] <dblosevn> oh you made img a jQobj
[11:07:39] <dblosevn> var img = this; img.src = img.src.replace('-dark.png', '-light.png');
[11:08:03] <JLT> isn't that the equivalent of this.src = this.src.replace(..., ...); ?
[11:08:18] <dblosevn> ya hes this one that came up with the img var
[11:08:37] <dblosevn> my original example had this.src = this.src.replace
[11:09:24] <JLT> If $(".snippet-num").children() has a list of li's, how would I add a selected class to the 8th li?
[11:09:48] <JLT> (and no class if the 8th element did not exist)
[11:10:01] <dblosevn> $('li.snippet-num:nth-child(8)').addClass('newclass');
[11:10:02] <nerk_> in a multi-page jquery mobile app, do you have to avoid views having elements with same IDs as previous views?  I am having odd behaviour where JS defined in the content div is running .. via pageinit.. but not applying to elements I want.
[11:10:07] <dblosevn> @JLT
[11:10:12] <JLT> ty dblosevn
[11:10:30] <nerk_> oddly though, there are no errors.
[11:10:32] <dblosevn> np
[11:10:55] <nerk_> for instance, I have a form on the top of two pages.. that form has different ids on each view and inits with a jquery autocomplete script
[11:11:23] <nerk_> when I hit the views directly the autocomplete works.. when I transition via ajax.. I can see the json being hit for autocomplete.. but nothing appears.. no autocomplete list
[11:13:24] <nerk_> hrrm
[11:15:32] <dblosevn> nerk_: yes being all pages are loaded into the dom you cant have the same id on multiple "pages"
[11:15:54] <nerk_> ok, but that is not true from what I see when I evaluate the dom
[11:16:07] <dblosevn> ?g jquery mobile using the same id on multiple pages
[11:16:09] <bot-t> dblosevn, Using IDs in jQuery Mobile Pages - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-ids-in-jquery-mobile-pages
[11:16:18] <nerk_> there is a content div that gets populated with the guts of the next pages content div
[11:16:34] <dblosevn> the other pages still exist in the dom though
[11:16:50] <dblosevn> just not in #content
[11:17:33] <nerk_> ok
[11:17:56] <dailylinux> ravenzz, ok. Is there "plugins" got getting nice scroll down effect?
[11:18:04] <nerk_> I still dont get though, why two different forms.. same layout.. different ids.. have a pageinit that attaches an autocomplete
[11:18:09] <nerk_> hitting the pages directly it works
[11:18:27] <nerk_> when transitioned via ajax, when you type, you can see the json being hit in the network tab
[11:18:36] <nerk_> but no autocomplete results list shows
[11:18:37] <dblosevn> because you cant have two ids in the same dom that are the same
[11:18:46] <nerk_> they are DIFFERENT ids
[11:18:55] <nerk_> id="chartingform" , id="quoteform
[11:18:57] <nerk_> "
[11:19:10] <nerk_> maybe.. the autocomplete is injecting an element with an id
[11:19:11] <nerk_> then
[11:19:35] <nerk_> hrrm.. that wouild make sense.
[11:19:47] <dblosevn> or the text field your binging the autocomplete to uses an id that is the same on bopth forms
[11:19:54] <dblosevn> *binding
[11:20:00] <dblosevn> both
[11:20:06] <nerk_> yah.. there would have to be some sort of conflict
[11:20:23] <nerk_> if it's running.. it's running on something..
[11:20:28] <dblosevn> id have to see the markup on both pages to give you more then a guess
[11:20:42] <nerk_> no doubt, that does help a lot though
[11:20:53] <nerk_> I do need to do a bit of restructuring of my views
[11:21:19] <nerk_> ahh, yes
[11:21:28] <nerk_> I have a <div id="autoComp-results"
[11:21:31] <nerk_> in both views
[11:21:33] <nerk_> durr
[11:21:37] <dblosevn> there ya go
[11:21:48] <nerk_> thx man.
[11:22:08] <dblosevn> try to stay away from using ids in jqm or anything really if you can get away with it
[11:22:29] <nerk_> I see discussion of #page1 #item, #page2 #item  .. but I think it's just best to make sure no view has IDs the same as any other view
[11:22:34] <dblosevn> walk the dom to fnd the element you need
[11:23:12] <nerk_> well, I could just give the main page div wrapper.. an id.. and chain off that.. eg./ #page_quote .autocomp-results
[11:23:18] <dblosevn> eg in your autocomplete callback do something like $(this).next().find('div');
[11:23:37] <dblosevn> would go to the next eleement after the input and find a div
[11:24:03] <nerk_> okays
[11:24:27] <dblosevn> i try to use the element im working with to find the next element as the target element is usually close to it
[11:24:35] <nerk_> I am using Tempo to populate json into html5 templates.  I might look at angularjs to handle that though
[11:25:20] <dblosevn> eg... i wouldnt have my autocomplete results at the top of the page when my autocomplete was at the bottom
[11:26:24] <nerk_> the div is directly after the parent form
[11:26:45] <nerk_> so I could $(this).parent('form').next().find('div');
[11:29:10] <nerk_> I have been building my own loader for json using $.getJSON();  Is there something built into jquery.mobile that I should be using instead?
[11:31:19] <dblosevn> $(this).closest('form').next() would be the lement imediately after form
[11:32:33] <dblosevn> $(this).parent('form') will do nothing if form is not a direct ancestor of this
[11:34:19] <coder7of9> suggestions? i need to do something elengant in IE for IE pre 10 as a degrade from css3 flip:  http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/flip/
[11:35:37] <dblosevn> didnt i give you a solution to that yesterday?
[11:35:47] <dblosevn> the only version if ie it didnt work in was 8
[11:35:57] <dblosevn> *of
[11:36:05] <coder7of9> yes but that one is buggy in 8
[11:36:07] <coder7of9> mmm yes
[11:36:17] <coder7of9> i need 7 and 8
[11:36:27] <coder7of9> a dream ?
[11:36:42] <coder7of9> what about filter:
[11:37:24] <dblosevn> that should work in 7
[11:37:37] <dblosevn> your problly not going to get that behavior in 8 with out flash
[11:38:06] <dblosevn> ie8 is when ms really `tried` to implement css3 and failed
[11:39:04] <dblosevn> before ie8 there was no css3 support so excanvas works
[11:39:09] <coder7of9> do you think flash is viable teh egneral public. many browsers turn it off.
[11:39:29] <dblosevn> i dont think ie8 is viable for the general public IMO
[11:39:34] <coder7of9> ha ha
[11:39:59] <coder7of9> is excanvas a heavy load on the browser?
[11:40:08] <dblosevn> but if your hell bent on having that behavior flash is about the only ay you will achieve it in ie8
[11:41:41] <coder7of9> i have seen a few jquery impemenetations which work in 7 and 8 but theyt are not beautiful
[11:43:46] <coder7of9> http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[11:45:35] <dblosevn> coder7of9: there not going to be beautiful
[11:45:52] <dblosevn> theres no support for canvas so they really cant be
[11:46:17] <dblosevn> unless you do a directx hack just for ie (I would never do that)
[11:46:23] <coder7of9> is excanvas a heavy load on the browser?
[11:46:50] <dblosevn> im sure it is, its loading a lot of functionality into the browser with js
[11:47:23] <coder7of9> ok i prefer performance and simpler transitions
[11:47:25] <coder7of9> thanks!
[11:52:28] <dblosevn> coder7of9: although google developed excanvas so you know its solid, and as light as possible
[12:16:43] <zsoc> I'm trying to take the data passed by success: of an ajax call and "transfer" it to a .dialog() ... but i'm not sure where to start
[12:17:15] <NoiseEee> well start by examining what 'data' is
[12:17:22] <NoiseEee> console.log it / debugger / explore
[12:17:30] <zsoc> obv it works fine with an alert... i have it passing back as json and just using function(i, item) and then alert(item.leftjson)
[12:17:38] <zsoc> and it gives me the result of the right side of that json, like i'm expecting
[12:17:45] <zsoc> I think i need a different format tho to get it to work with dialog
[12:18:44] <zsoc> and im using json because i'm passing back a few things... success/fail and then an error number and a transaction number
[12:19:22] <zsoc> its just weird i'm not getting an error when i use .dialog ... just nothing happens...
[12:20:18] <zsoc> Usually the selector i use for .dialog is a div
[12:20:34] <zsoc> is that the problem? do i have to convert the item.result or whatever into .html or .text and put it in a div, then call dialog?
[12:20:42] * zsoc is clearly rubber ducking now
[12:21:23] <rmurphey> ?demo @ zsoc
[12:21:24] <bot-t> zsoc, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:21:52] <zsoc> rmurphey, is there some sort of 'default' ajax call that will return success? I'm not sure how to template an ajax in jsfiddle..
[12:22:13] <rmurphey> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[12:22:29] <zsoc> ty
[12:23:39] <zsoc> im an idiot. *sigh*. I need to rubberduck in notepad next time.
[12:24:02] <zsoc> I just stuff the data into an empty selective div.html... then (this).dialog
[12:24:42] <zsoc> well, heh probably. otherwise i'll have a jsfiddle in a sec
[12:32:28] <zsoc> Im missing something fundimental here... how do you use an object as a jquery selector
[12:32:53] <zsoc> success: function(data) { $.each(data, function(i, item) { $(item.result).dialog();
[12:43:04] <zsoc> Ok. console.log(this); returns Object {result: "unsuccess|0"} ... how would i get "unsuccess|0" into a .dialog()
[12:43:15] <hyper_ch> hi there, is there a way to stop jqueryui dialog to preload all the dialog links?
[13:00:02] <zsoc> Why would alert(item) work, firing string 'unsuccess', but $(item).dialog() give `Uncaught ReferenceError: obj is not defined`
[13:00:24] <zsoc> whoops it doesn't
[13:00:36] <zsoc> it just doesn't do anything -_--
[13:03:16] <JessC> @zsoc is item referencing a dom element?
[13:03:36] <JessC> or a string id for an element
[13:04:12] <zsoc> JessC, no... it's referencing the property side of a json object... like `$.each(data, function(i, item) {` where data is {"result":"unsuccess"}
[13:04:29] <zsoc> and like i said, alert() or console.log shows 'unsuccess' properly (without quotes ofc)
[13:04:54] <JessC>  but when you pass it to jquery its expecting item to be a dom element
[13:04:54] <zsoc> i tried things to toString and toSource with other various silly errors
[13:05:06] <JessC> if you're passing a json object it won't match anything and thus does nothing
[13:05:09] <zsoc> Ok.. hence why i was trying toSource and toString... but that doesn't convert it i suppose...
[13:05:15] <zsoc> So do i have to put it in a div somewhere or something?
[13:05:23] <zsoc> or is there a way to pass an anonymous dom element
[13:05:38] <JessC> you can create a dom element
[13:05:46] <JessC> pass that object into a dom element
[13:06:18] <JessC> are you trying to display it inside a dialog?
[13:06:39] <zsoc> JessC, yeah.. this function is iteration json over the return of ajax 'success'
[13:06:54] <zsoc> I mean do i just need to put some hidden <div> on the page and then .text or .innerHTML it?
[13:06:58] <zsoc> and then dialog that?
[13:07:32] <JessC> yeah, haven't used jquery ui but what you can do is write your info to the text body part of the dialog then display the dialog
[13:07:43] <zsoc> or.. hmm... var dom = $("<div>") ?
[13:07:49] <zsoc> oh ok
[13:08:18] <JessC> give me a second creating an example
[13:08:18] <zsoc> "write you info to the text body part of the dialog"
[13:08:25] <zsoc> sorry i'm being dense
[13:08:25] <zsoc> thank you
[13:09:26] <mlang> How would I go about displaying an image in front of a list-item, when you hover over it? If I do it with .prepend() my Text moves, and I want to try to avoid that.
[13:10:26] <zsoc> mlang, last time i needed something like that i used a tooltip lib... there are some fancy ones out there
[13:11:46] <mlang> zsoc: Any recommendations?
[13:12:36] <zsoc> honestly i can't remember which one i used honestly.. they are all fairly 'robust' in the sense it may not be worth you delving into it if it's something simple.... can you just add the img to innerHTML and then position it relative to the parent div setting top/left?
[13:14:42] <JessC> @mslang you can try setting the image css to postion absolute with a z-index
[13:14:47] <JessC> and it'll float over the text
[13:14:55] <JessC> or should i say relative so it remains inside the li tag
[13:15:17] <mlang> Ah, I think we are actually talking about two different things. JessC
[13:15:51] <eltoro> guys please i need your help with english
[13:16:15] <zsoc> eltoro, i don't think we teach english here? try google translate
[13:16:22] <eltoro> does anyone has a funny word/phrase to define a "funny market trade for bartering"
[13:16:23] <eltoro> ?
[13:16:43] <eltoro> i know but here are cool peoples :(
[13:16:56] <zsoc> eltoro, can you give me the phrase in it's original language please
[13:17:02] <eltoro> is there any irc channel for webdomains ?
[13:17:06] <zsoc> JessC, you still with me jess? my head hurts :/ i'm about to go to prototype for this D:
[13:17:16] <mlang> JessC, zsoc: http://imgur.com/ufF9v Something like this
[13:17:48] <eltoro> @zsoc i am looking for somenthing cool funny for my site domain the site is a barter site but it is funny :D
[13:17:56] <zsoc> mlang, set those arrows there... visibility:hidden
[13:18:08] <mlang> zsoc: Thats what I'm doing right now.
[13:18:22] <zsoc> mlang, visibility hidden will act like the div is still there.. so it won't move objects around when you .show
[13:18:51] <zsoc> mlang, are you using display:none or visibility:hidden?
[13:19:12] <mlang> zsoc: I'm actually doing it on document load with hide(), shall I just set it in the CSS?
[13:19:14] <eltoro> if someone has a irc channel where i can ask about sit domain is perfect!!
[13:19:25] <eltoro> *site
[13:19:31] <zsoc> mlang, yes... .hide() will display:none, which removes the elemnt from the page!
[13:19:37] <mlang> Ah!
[13:19:39] <mlang> That makes sense!
[13:19:41] <zsoc> visibility leaves it there, just makes it invisible... so nothing shifts around
[13:19:56] <mlang> Thanks! I always get those mixed up!
[13:20:04] <zsoc> me too lol
[13:20:12] <zsoc> took one frsutrating layout session and now i'll never forgot lol
[13:20:33] <mlang> Is there a awesome function, that sets hidden?
[13:21:02] <zsoc> mlang, nope... this.css('visibility', 'hidden');
[13:21:14] <zsoc> but if you need to use it a lot just create two functions.. one to hide and one to show
[13:21:34] <mlang> zsoc: Not really, only need it in that place. Alright, thank you, i highly appreciate your help! :)
[13:21:40] <zsoc> np
[13:21:40] <JessC> @zsoc http://jsfiddle.net/wZBee/
[13:22:02] <zsoc> JessC, dat stringify! thank you
[13:22:27] <zsoc> so i need to have that empty div somewhere
[13:22:28] <zsoc> gotcha
[13:23:17] <zhulikas> I am looking for a javascript library which would let me set up step by step instructions in a website

[13:23:19] <JessC> @zsoc yes or you could create it with jquery but if you are using it more than once then its best to just create the html once and reuse it
[13:23:19] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE using it more than once then its best to just create the html once and reuse it
[13:23:20] <zhulikas> for UI
[13:28:07] <zsoc> b-ot, wat
[13:28:08] <b-ot> zsoc, http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535
[13:28:08] <zsoc> lol
[13:28:17] <zsoc> LOL
[13:28:20] <zsoc> dis bot right here
[14:14:58] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/EK9Vp/ this doesnt work.....  http://jsfiddle.net/LhyuF/240/ this one does... all i did was change some variables.. so i thought
[14:15:03] <veQue> help please
[14:19:23] <veQue> someone just gave me the answer nevermind
[14:22:01] <devone> how inefficient is $.getScript()?
[14:22:26] <devone> are there methods better suggested over getScript()?
[14:22:49] <devone> e.g. copy+paste+minify
[14:24:17] <JessC> @devone I guess it depends on what you do, i use requirejs but my goal is to better manage my javascript files
[14:24:41] <devone> well i ask about jQuery.cookie actually, it's not used everywhere
[14:24:54] <devone> so I wonder if getScript in the method itself could be best
[14:25:44] <JessC> why not just load it in normally?
[14:25:46] <devone> I am also pulling jQ from Google CDN
[14:25:59] <tucan> Hi, I don't know if I should be talking about it here but maybe you guys can offer something to get me started. Im brainstorming on some additional features on my dictionary sites and
[14:26:00] <devone> as an http request?
[14:26:18] <tucan> It's like this. I'm thinking a user uploads an image of a girl or something. Everyone can draw arrows and link words to a part of the image
[14:26:26] <tucan>  head, lips, pants, mittens etc etc
[14:26:57] <tucan> I'm thinking this is probably a mixture of an html5 canvas and jquery but I'm not totally sure
[14:27:05] <JessC> @devone in the header tag like you load jquery from the cdn
[14:27:13] <devone> sounds like facebook photo tagging tucan
[14:27:18] <tucan> right
[14:27:38] <devone> JessC, <head> as opposed to just before </body>? any reason?
[14:27:51] <tucan> could you give me some directions how to implement that? I'm kind of a newbie
[14:28:54] <tucan> someone told me that I can also draw the arrows with SVG. I'm not sure what route to take
[14:29:10] <JessC> @devone If you are loading the plugin then you can just put it in the header after the jquery script. Normally people only put scripts at the bottom of the page before </html> when its a script that manipulates the dom but they don't want to use jquery's ready function
[14:29:10] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE loading the plugin then you can just put it in the header after the jquery script. Normally people only put scripts at the bottom of the page before </html> when its a script that manipulates the dom but they don't want to use jquery's ready function
[14:29:24] <NoiseEee> oh b-ot will you ever cease to entertain
[14:30:38] <tucan> is there any free implementation of facebook photo tagging on the web? ive been trying to look for one
[14:31:36] <tucan> ive done autocomplete search boxes with jquery ui but this seems way more advanced to me
[14:32:10] <JessC> @tucan i've never seen one, they have a pretty custom implementation with both front/backend code
[14:33:15] <JessC> @tucan http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/image-tagging-tutorial/
[14:37:38] <tucan> very nice
[14:39:42] <tucan> JessC: that's basically what I'm after but I kind of want an arrow to pinpoint one exact spot
[14:40:33] <JessC> @tucan not sure you will find an exact tutorial for what you're wanting to do but the link i sent should at least be a starting off point to getting the basics for how to put it together and then you should be able to fine tun eit
[14:40:33] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU'RE wanting to do but the link i sent should at least be a starting off point to getting the basics for how to put it together and then you should be able to fine tun eit
[14:41:28] <tucan> JessC: thanks appreciate it :)
[14:55:35] <ajpiano> JesseC: sorry about b-ot, he is our new bot and has some weird quirks
[14:55:35] <bung> what's the "name" of the url system that jsfiddle uses, site.com/29381/1, so i can google and do it myself on something
[14:55:44] <bung> its not rest is it?
[14:55:48] <ajpiano> such as attempting to cleverly "no you" things where it thinks it's appropriate
[14:56:24] <tw2113> sup ajpiano
[14:56:48] <ajpiano> nm finishing a lanyard
[14:57:36] <Quix0r> hmm, I could use some help. I have currently no idea how to do it. I have written a setup script that have an backend in PHP which stores all installation data in session
[14:58:03] <Quix0r> now I want to start the installation and display some progress bar for the user with a floating div
[14:58:26] <Quix0r> the div is already ready: http://photos.mxchange.org/?v=pd&d=albums/Installationsroutine_NG&img=15#15
[14:58:38] <Quix0r> that blue one :)
[14:59:28] <Quix0r> so how do I don't fake the progress bar? e.g. I may need to call the ajax backend on an interval and wait for the response, if the response is received (no errors) then the progress bar got updated
[14:59:49] <Quix0r> in an error happens displayErrorWindow() is called
[14:59:53] <Quix0r> or shall be called ;)
[15:00:04] <Quix0r> and installation doesn't continue
[15:01:58] <Quix0r> no one here? :(
[15:02:31] <Quix0r> and how can I register the RETURN key on a button?
[15:04:53] <Quix0r> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js <-- inconsistent new-line characters. please fix it
[15:05:03] <tw2113> i just lack an answer
[15:05:31] <tw2113> submit your own patch that fixes the new-line chars
[15:11:23] <Quix0r> it is really easy to fix: $ dos2unix -f *.js
[15:21:22] <Quix0r> hmm, not really easy
[15:21:52] <Quix0r> if you need scripts: http://mxchange-demo.de/install.php?installer=ajax
[15:22:09] <Quix0r> the code comments are all english, don't worry :)
[15:23:02] <Quix0r> maybe start looking at install-common.sj
[15:23:07] <Quix0r> .js
[15:24:41] <Quix0r> stupid vodafone router :( always crashing :( :( :(
[15:24:53] <Quix0r> or slow DNS resolving :(
[15:50:45] <prawnsalad> hey guys. im using $.getJSON(url, function (){}), but the callback is never fired
[15:51:04] <prawnsalad> despite the url successfully loading in the network monitor in chrome dev tools
[15:51:15] <prawnsalad> whats the best way to actually debug this?
[15:53:39] <prawnsalad> example line that is failing even in the web dev console:
[15:53:42] <prawnsalad> $.getJSON('http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/13odyh/thank_you_des_moines_iowa_atheists_you_got_my_vote.json?callback=?', function (data) { console.log(1); });
[15:59:44] <prawnsalad> ohh.. was using the wrong callback fn string in the URL
[15:59:45] <prawnsalad> mybad
[17:40:53] <SmallCode> Sup everyone if you have jquery @SmallCode and ill help ya
[17:41:01] <SmallCode> questions
[17:43:40] <SmallCode> Mateus you here?
[17:45:30] <SmallCode> I got a question for all of you jQuery bros
[17:45:43] <SmallCode> Best way to make jQuery drop down menu that when you click outside of it, it closes?
[17:46:42] <jrockjiggz> blur
[17:47:22] <dblosevn> jrockjiggz: blur wont necissarily work on a jquery dropdown menu, id probally bind to window.click
[17:47:45] <jrockjiggz> yea
[17:47:56] <dblosevn> if the element clicked on has a handler it will be fired before the event is bubbled to window
[17:48:03] <jrockjiggz> I personally find CSS more consistant when it comes to drop downs
[17:48:34] <SmallCode> Right jRock
[17:48:39] <SmallCode> But If I click out of it?
[17:48:52] <SmallCode> Ahh jrock blur would work?
[17:49:06] <dblosevn> do you not read lmao
[17:49:31] <SmallCode> Yeah i read partially dblo lol
[17:49:39] <dblosevn> lol
[17:49:41] <SmallCode> I was gonna say
[17:49:42] <jrockjiggz> since the channel is not very active. i thougth i would drop this here
[17:49:42] <jrockjiggz> https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
[17:49:44] <SmallCode> blur prolly wouldnt work
[17:51:19] <dblosevn> although blur might work as blur bubbles
[17:53:06] <jrockjiggz> black friday lifetime discounts? https://www.ubiquityservers.com/blackfriday
[17:53:20] <jrockjiggz> oops wrong chan
[18:17:24] <textchimp> is it possible to get the selector currently used? by currently i mean if you do $('a, img').live('click', func...) can you access the selector used for each match, i.e. 'a' or 'img' ?
[18:19:41] <dogmatic69> textchimp: in the function, this
[18:20:05] <dogmatic69> .live('click', function() { condole.log(this); });
[18:22:17] <relipse>  how do I make a <input type="submit" button height 50% of the whole page?
[18:23:12] <textchimp> dogmatic, that returns an object right? what if i want the string?
[18:23:31] <dblosevn> textchimp: inspect the object and find the selector
[18:23:43] <textchimp> ah ok
[18:23:49] <dblosevn> its buried in there somewhere
[18:23:52] <textchimp> thanks
[18:24:00] <dblosevn> np
[18:26:36] <dblosevn> textchimp: wow lol try $(this).selector
[18:27:02] <systemfault> if you really need to know thatâ€¦ you probably did something wrong.
[18:27:12] <dblosevn> yep thats what im thinking too
[18:27:13] <rmurphey> textchimp: note that .live() is deprecated
[18:27:16] <rmurphey> and also what systemfault said
[18:27:46] <systemfault> Right, .live has been replaced by the second form of .on
[18:28:11] <dblosevn> ive never needed to know wat selector was used to fire my listner so I really dont know off the top of my head how to get it, I I usually 99.999% certain what fired my listener lol
[18:28:47] <dblosevn> I am usually***
[19:08:06] <Taggnostr> I have a list of 2-elements lists, e.g. [['foo', 'bar'] , ['foo', 'baz'], ...], what's the best way to iterate over the sublists and assign the two values to two vars inside the loop?
[19:09:14] <Taggnostr> in python I would do  "for fst, snd in list_of_lists: ..."
[19:25:31] <gnarf> Taggnostr: $.each( list_of_lists, function( index, sublist ) { var fst = sublist[0], snd = sublist[1] });
[19:25:40] <gnarf> or just use a for loop
[19:25:50] <Taggnostr> gnarf, yep, just figured that out
[19:25:55] <Taggnostr> I have a question though
[19:26:08] <Taggnostr> why if I do function(sublist) I get the index?
[19:26:20] <gnarf> because index is the first arg in each
[19:26:28] <gnarf> $.map( ) has value first
[19:26:32] <Taggnostr> if I do the same thing while iterating on an object I get the properties though
[19:26:41] <gnarf> its the only jQuery iterator that has first
[19:26:51] <gnarf> Taggnostr: key, value for each
[19:27:05] <Taggnostr> so is it either function(key, value) or function(index, value)?
[19:27:07] <gnarf> $.each({ key1: "value1" }, function( key, value ) {});
[19:27:17] <Taggnostr> ok, makes sense
[19:27:19] <gnarf> Taggnostr: technically its "key" either way
[19:27:33] <gnarf> $.map( list_of_lists, function( sublist ) { }); would work tho
[19:27:57] <gnarf> note that $.map is different from $.fn.map
[19:28:21] <Taggnostr> do you think I should use this instead of .each?
[19:28:22] <gnarf> $.map is the only iterator that passes value, keyt --- the others are key, value
[19:28:28] <gnarf> $.each, $.fn.each, $.fn.map

[19:50:35] <SmallCode> motako
[19:50:37] <SmallCode> What?
[20:14:01] <tobago> using this snippet: https://gist.github.com/4133010 fails in firefox with: "TypeError: remote_link.attr is not a function"
[20:14:30] <tobago> how to access the href without failing?
[20:21:22] <motaka2> Hello in this page http://parsmosafer.com/test/Cal I want when the user clicks on a date from the opening calendar an alert box shows itself , but it doesnt work can you help me?
[20:32:43] <motaka2> no one thee?
[20:33:50] <dblosevn> were here just trying to translate your english to english
[20:34:41] <enderx86> how do you generally implement a login? you have a text input for username, a password input for password, but then what?
[20:35:01] <systemfault> Then what?
[20:35:08] <enderx86> do you encrypt the password client-side before you send it? with a js function?
[20:35:18] <dblosevn> enderx86: some backend logic to handle the auth
[20:35:18] <enderx86> what is the typical approach to designing a login
[20:35:29] <dblosevn> enderx86: if it needs encrypted use ssl
[20:35:30] <systemfault> enderx86: It's often sent as clear text...
[20:35:40] <enderx86> sent as clear text?! that is so insecure
[20:35:45] <systemfault> enderx86: But SSL is a must (HTTPS)
[20:35:53] <enderx86> I know twitter sent its passwords as plaintext not so long ago
[20:36:05] <enderx86> Anyone in a cafe with a sniffer turned on could pick up twitter passwords...
[20:36:19] <systemfault> Heh.
[20:36:43] <_zoggy_> twitter uses oauth, but your prob talking about facebook
[20:37:30] <enderx86> No, I'm talking about twitter. They may have changed it. That was the case... 3 years ago.
[20:37:46] <enderx86> There's no way facebook sends plaintext passwords... do they?
[20:37:52] <enderx86> I'd be *amazed*
[20:37:57] <systemfault> I think it used to be the case.
[20:38:15] <enderx86> Too many politicians in this world who use facebook in a cafe for that to be the case any more :-)
[20:38:23] <motaka2> Hello in this page http://parsmosafer.com/test/Cal I want when the user clicks on a date from the opening calendar an alert box shows itself , but it doesnt work can you help me?
[20:41:17] <enderx86> To get back to my question, is SSL the best way to perform a secure login? I have no experience with SSL... it seems easier to me just to use a javascript function to encrypt the password before sending
[20:41:28] <enderx86> What is most common, best practice, etc.
[20:42:01] <motaka2> enderx86: can u see my question ?
[20:42:13] <enderx86> Yes.
[20:42:25] <enderx86> Your English isn't the best...
[20:42:41] <motaka2> enderx86: No it is not , are you willing to help ?
[20:43:49] <enderx86> I don't think I can help you with that question.
[20:44:32] <motaka2> enderx86: What kind of question can you help me with ?
[20:45:59] <motaka2> Hello in this page http://parsmosafer.com/test/Cal , I want when the user clicks on the input in the middle of the blue box, after the calendar is opened and he picks a date an alert box pops up
[20:47:16] <motaka2> enderx86: Is it better now?
[20:53:08] <enderx86> motaka2 it looks like you have killed this channel.
[20:53:18] <systemfault> :/
[20:53:36] <motaka2> enderx86: I hate stupid unwilling people
[20:53:40] <enderx86> systemfault: How would I setup SSL for a Tomcat server?
[20:54:03] <enderx86> b/c ultimately this is going to be a tomcat webapp
[20:54:18] <systemfault> enderx86: Google tomcat setup ssl? :/
[20:54:39] <systemfault> I only did that once with tomcat.. and it was easy
[20:56:17] <enderx86> ok
[21:21:57] <dblosevn> ?g configure ssl for tomcat
[21:22:02] <bot-t> dblosevn, The Apache Tomcat 5.5 Servlet/JSP Container - SSL Configuration ... - http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/ssl-howto.html
[21:32:17] <dblosevn> motaka2: dont be a dick, http://pastebin.com/VhCv7S9n we are alll more then happy to help, but if we dont understand you we just simply dont understand you
[21:33:33] <dblosevn> motaka2: not to mention that calendar isnt even jquery
[21:34:52] <motaka2> dblosevn: I thought it is , but the code I write to catch the click event is jquery
[21:35:34] <dblosevn> motaka2: there is a perfectly good event to listen to on the calendar plugin onSelect
[21:36:20] <motaka2> dblosevn: You are genious
[21:36:35] <dblosevn> motaka2: no I just read the comments
[21:37:35] <motaka2> dblosevn: Would you please check it once agin the code the form doesnt submit
[21:37:47] <dblosevn> motaka2: *   onSelect         | function that gets called when a date is selected.  You don't _have_ to supply this (the default is generally okay)
[21:40:23] <motaka2> dblosevn: I cant submit the form
[21:42:35] <dblosevn> motaka2: theres something wrong with your form that line is being called
[21:43:56] <motaka2> dblosevn: What might be wrong ? //        onSelect: function () {
[21:43:57] <motaka2> //                        $("#date-submit").submit();
[21:43:59] <motaka2> //                }
[21:44:13] <motaka2> to me it seems everything is ok
[21:44:49] <dblosevn> yes but running $('#date-submit').submit(); from the console does nothing
[21:48:20] <motaka2> dblosevn: Is that a question ?
[21:48:32] <dblosevn> motaka2: thats a statement
[21:48:46] <motaka2> dblosevn: Then what should I do ?
[22:04:36] <dblosevn> motaka2: the problem is with yout html im not even trying to fix that its a nightmare, get your html to validate then it will work
[22:04:43] <dblosevn> *your html
[22:05:18] <motaka2> dblosevn: But I dont have time to validate it -
[22:06:16] <dblosevn> motaka2: then you dont have time to fix your issue, hire a developer to do it for you... and before you ask Im not availble for this job lol im getting on my xbox now
