[01:20:40] <Aniket> Last years problem statement said it wanted to reduce the bug fixes for JQM but they didnt eliminate all of them sp is there a chance they will be a part of this years gsov
[01:20:46] <Aniket> Gsoc*
[01:22:06] <Cork> uh... remove bugfixes?
[01:22:15] <Cork> you want the bugs to be left around you mean?
[01:22:45] <Cork> code have bugs, aiming to do better is a good one, but you can't get to never having them
[01:23:10] <Aniket> No i am just asking if the bugs are still left to be resolved it may be a chance that again they will be there this summer
[01:23:39] <Cork> no clue, you would have to ask in #jquery-dev
[01:24:17] <Aniket> Okay i was asking so that i wud start contributing as soon as possible
[01:24:44] <Aniket> And wud help me to complete the program as well
[01:25:07] <anes> Dear friends, there is any method to change currently running file with another in ableplayer on clicking a hyper link?
[01:25:17] <anes> i mean using jQuery
[01:25:49] <Cork> anes: that question is prob better asked in a support forum for ableplayer
[01:26:01] <Cork> as it will depend on the player, not jquery
[01:26:56] <anes> @Cork: there is any irc chat room for ableplayer?
[01:27:05] <Cork> donno
[02:25:41] <afx_> Hello! What are the benefits of sending data to the server by using ajax , instead of plain HTML form action ?
[02:25:55] <afx_> (pls forgive my ignorance new here)
[02:26:18] <slax0r> not having to reload and re-download the whole page, and rerender it in the browser
[02:27:37] <Cork> afx_: when the browser has to tear down the old document and build a new one from scratch, it takes a lot of time
[02:28:02] <Cork> you can make things a lot smoother if you keep the document around and instead modify it in-place
[02:28:59] <afx_> so this is only if I want to stay on the same page , if there will be a redirect there is no point of using ajax right
[02:29:12] <Cork> it might be
[02:29:27] <Cork> if the resulting page has very similar content
[02:29:35] <afx_> I mean in case of a submit form , if by clicking submit you get directed to another page I could just use html right?
[02:29:36] <Cork> (same style, same header and so on)
[02:29:54] <Cork> if the two locations isn't on the same server you can't normally use ajax
[02:30:22] <afx_> Cork, so keeping the template and change the contents with jquery and make requests with ajax? is that what you re saying ?
[02:30:30] <Cork> yes
[02:30:39] <Cork> build the page up of partials
[02:30:48] <Cork> and instead of posting to get the full page
[02:30:55] <afx_> ok
[02:30:56] <Cork> just post and get the partial that changed
[02:31:04] <Cork> and replace that part of the page
[02:31:28] <Cork> (this is the most basic form of ajax though, there can be much more js driven solutions then that)
[02:32:22] <afx_> so are these parts shown without a refresh , I mean how does the client interpret the changes in a <div> element ,done by jquery for example
[02:32:26] <Cork> like ajax requests json, and uses that to construct the dom structure needed, either through templating or similar
[02:32:49] <Cork> afx_: the html is sent to js as a string
[02:33:02] <Cork> it is up to the callback from the ajax call to do what needs to happen with it
[02:33:15] <Cork> (ex. replace a part of the page)
[02:33:39] <afx_> For now I have a form and would like to send the data entered to a flask web server. I just care about the data arriving correctly and if not I should be warned about that
[02:34:14] <Cork> if the server is on the same server (same domain name and ip) you could use ajax
[02:34:24] <Cork> and just display a message when it completes
[02:34:33] <Cork> then the server wouldn't have to render a response at all
[02:34:45] <Cork> (it would have to send a 200 server header though)
[02:35:12] <afx_> ok
[02:35:39] <afx_> really appreciate your help! I will try this and post back if I have more question :)

[08:06:19] <Cork> jquery803: use console.log
[08:06:25] <Cork> never use alert for debugging
[08:07:03] <jquery803> ok thanks, I thougth about it but didn't work before, now yes!
[08:07:04] <jquery803> thanks!
[09:41:11] <printForever> I'm unable to figure out how to trigger function on XHR complete
[09:41:26] <printForever> can someone please share an example or an idea or tut
[09:41:38] <Woet> printForever: show your current code with your attempt
[09:42:09] <printForever> Woet, I have the code, but I'm interested
[09:42:16] <Woet> printForever: ?
[09:42:16] <printForever> how can I select a correct XHR
[09:42:21] <printForever> they dont have an id or a aname
[09:42:30] <printForever> how do I target that specific XHR
[09:42:41] <printForever> by Response HeadeR? Request header?
[09:42:43] <Woet> printForever: i dont know what you mean.
[09:42:59] <printForever>  $(document).ajaxComplete(function () {
[09:43:16] <printForever> it means that jQuery ajaxComplete is watching ENTIRE document
[09:43:26] <printForever> for ajax to complete
[09:43:43] <printForever> and it has an anonymous function to run some code
[09:43:52] <printForever> I want to run that code on a specific XHR completed
[09:43:55] <Woet> printForever: did you even read the docs?
[09:43:56] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxcomplete/
[09:44:02] <printForever> yes
[09:44:07] <Woet> are you sure?
[09:44:08] <Woet> it tells you how to differentiate
[09:44:19] <Woet> with an example.
[09:44:51] <printForever> I've put document ready over ajaxComplete
[09:44:53] <printForever> #tard
[09:45:28] <printForever> still not working
[09:45:34] <printForever> I'm not getting anything in the console
[09:46:01] <Woet> printForever: as I already requested, show your code
[09:46:15] <shoky> $.ajax().always(function() { ... })
[09:47:32] <printForever> Woet: http://pastebin.com/VSrWGqZw
[09:48:02] <Woet> printForever: where is your ajax call?
[09:48:02] <printForever> I'm not getting any console.log output
[09:48:16] <printForever> I don't know... I'm editing a website
[09:48:25] <printForever> I have only access to my own script
[09:48:42] <Woet> printForever: add your own ajax call and see if it works.
[09:48:54] <printForever> how?
[09:49:43] <shoky> ajaxComplete would only work for requests done by jquery, the same jquery you're using
[09:49:52] <Woet> printForever: by writing the code.
[09:49:57] <printForever> Woet: still nothing
[09:50:03] <Woet> printForever: show your code.
[09:50:09] <printForever> I've showed it...
[09:50:17] <Woet> printForever: show your code with the AJAX call added as I instructed you.
[09:50:41] <printForever> $.get( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {  $( ".result" ).html( data );  alert( "Load was performed." );});
[09:50:52] <printForever> thats it...
[09:51:02] <printForever> nothing happens
[09:51:20] <Woet> printForever: show your entire code and use an actual URL that exists.
[09:51:53] <Justice> Im getting a json object as a response however JSON.Parse fails with array of "{"ID":80774,"URL":"http://www.yahoo.se","Customer":"true"}"
[09:52:21] <Woet> Justice: with those quotes around it included?
[09:52:32] <Justice> Woet: yes that's the issue
[09:52:41] <Woet> Justice: if you know the issue, what is your question?
[09:52:52] <Justice> is there a "clean" way of doing it?
[09:52:59] <Woet> Justice: why are they there in the first place?
[09:53:51] <Justice> Im not sure, backend escapes the inner quotes etc but it seems that the ajax post gets the quotes in response.
[09:54:16] <Woet> Justice: so the clean way of doing it is by fixing that bug.
[09:56:07] <Justice> hm true,
[10:04:24] <Justice> Woet hm is it possible that $.ajax gives the doublequotes?
[10:04:49] <Woet> Justice: why dont you check the raw request in your browser?
[10:05:08] <Woet> Justice: and theres .getJSON
[10:06:05] <Woet> Justice: if you send the right content-type, .ajax will convert it automatically too.
[10:10:20] <Justice> Woet: currently using "application/json" but seems that would be wrong for this type.
[10:10:34] * hlve slaps Justice with a trout.
[10:13:29] * Justice :(
[10:35:10] <Cork> Justice: what you showed there isn't an array though
[10:35:21] <Cork> its an object
[10:36:13] <rjCousineau> Hi.  I have table ...<td><select class="designationSelect"></select></td>...   $(document).on('change', '.designationSelect', function(){ $(this).parentsUntil('tr').find('td').css({ color: 'red' });  });  //when i run this, it doesn't set each <td>'s background. I'm confused on the use of parentsUntil();
[10:36:47] <rjCousineau> brb
[10:37:17] <Cork> rjCousineau: you want .closest('tr') not parentsUntil
[10:38:02] <Cork> closestUntill creates a result of all the parents starting at the select until the parent is a tr
[10:38:16] <Cork> so it will do $('td').find('td')
[10:38:26] <Cork> (that won't find anything)
[10:39:03] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').children('td').css({ color: 'red' }) is prob what i would recommend
[10:39:14] <Cork> or even better $(this).closest('tr').children('td').addClass('highlight')
[10:39:43] <Cork> the later is easier to reset after you want to remove the highlight (and has the bonus of keeping the css out of the js file)
[10:43:19] <rjCousineau> Cork: that's awesome thank you.  i noticed you use children() instead of find().  I understand that find() only searches the children of the selector.  in this situation isn't children() synonymous with find()?  Maybe children() is lighter
[10:43:49] <Cork> rjCousineau: <div><span><a><span>
[10:44:20] <Cork> if your statring position is the div .find('span') will find both, and .children('span') will only find the one wrapping <a>
[10:44:51] <Cork> full html: <div><span><a><span></span></a></span></div>
[10:47:05] <rjCousineau> like >
[10:47:19] <rjCousineau> direct children
[10:47:21] <rjCousineau> thanks
[10:47:32] <Cork> yes
[10:47:37] <Silverbaq> Hi! I'm very new to JQuery (and JS in total) - I'm trying to make multiple list, and be able to drag items between them. So fair I think that is working as it should. But I would like to know if there is a way to add a value the every list, so that I know what list an item was in. http://pastebin.com/raw/vWmWFZ9u
[10:50:44] <jerit> location.href = "new_url_goes_here"; for some reason seems to only refresh the current page?
[10:51:08] <jerit> omg its my asp.net
[10:51:23] <jerit> the button is doing a form submit which is screwing everything up
[11:12:03] <Guddu> What are the suggested alternative frameworks to Kendo UI. The license is very costly and I was looking for a free or less expensive solution.
[12:03:07] <ZoderUgg3> what content management system is this on "AdminLTE"  https://youtu.be/rzoQoB9N3v8?t=606    at t = 606
[12:06:49] <phelix> $.each(data.departureMonth, function(key, value) { console.log(key, value); $('#drp_departureMonth').append($('<option>').text(value).attr('value', key)); });
[12:07:29] <phelix> why would the console.log show exact values I am trying to get however inside the <options> I am creating the key only shows 0,1,2,3 and the value is [object, object] ?
[12:29:31] <jerit> is it possible to generate click events for elements that you're generating in a loop?
[12:40:50] <kof> jerit you can add another function after generating element/html
[12:41:15] <kof> click events works with valid html selector

[13:55:29] <qiller> robertmaxrees: thank you
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:25:56] <qakhan> hi all, i am using jquery validate plugin and trying to validate .csv file using accept method
[14:27:07] <qakhan> accept: "csv"  but its not validating the file.
[14:27:22] <qakhan> message comes up "Please enter a value with a valid mimetype."
[14:27:38] <robertmaxrees> qakhan http://stackoverflow.com/a/15846921
[14:27:47] <qakhan> i used extension method which validate the file.
[14:28:34] <robertmaxrees> you said you're using accept >.>
[14:28:36] <qakhan> but if i rename a image.jpg to image.csv then extension method does not check file mime type
[14:28:41] <qakhan> yes
[14:28:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't use accept
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> you use extension instead.
[14:29:15] <qakhan> but extension method does not check file mime type
[14:29:38] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing a fiddle then?
[14:29:38] <qakhan> any file can be rename to .csv and there will be mess
[14:32:19] <qakhan> robertmaxrees here http://jsfiddle.net/c5R3b/52/
[14:32:29] <qakhan> with extension method
[14:35:16] <robertmaxrees> and the accept version?
[14:36:04] <qakhan> here http://jsfiddle.net/c5R3b/53/
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> accept should be "text/csv"
[14:38:24] <qakhan> it will not make any difference
[14:38:42] <robertmaxrees> everything i'm reading says you need to supply a mimetype there.
[14:38:43] <qakhan> i already have tried it
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> not an extension.
[14:39:29] <qakhan> yes, accept method does not work
[14:39:32] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/issues/1258
[14:39:52] <robertmaxrees> i might search around some more, but my guess is that you're kind of stuck here.
[14:40:26] <qakhan> yup
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd just check the extension and add in some backend validation as well (which you should already have)
[14:42:19] <Hoder> If I run an if statement to check a user's score at the end of a function, is there a way to run this if only once based on whether they were given the message or not?
[14:42:40] <robertmaxrees> store the result in a var somewhere and check that first.
[14:43:19] <qakhan> robertmaxrees can you please show me what you have done?
[14:43:26] <robertmaxrees> qakhan searched google.
[14:44:00] <Hoder> So for this if, I have:      if (player_score > 1500){       var office_location = office_loc2;       console.log("Congratulations, you moved up in the world of Marketing! Enjoy your new office! Something something about .02x boost");     }
[14:44:14] <robertmaxrees> Hoder make a fiddle or somethjing - hard to read code in chat :)
[14:44:24] <Hoder> Sure thing, one sec :)
[14:44:51] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i did not get you
[14:45:09] <robertmaxrees> qakhan about what?
[14:45:11] <robertmaxrees> the backend validation?
[14:45:31] <Hoder> So right now, the game plays out in console: https://jsfiddle.net/  My issue is on line 65
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> Hoder gotta save it and share out the new link :)
[14:45:49] <Hoder> Since there can be a possible of 5 different offices based on the user's current revenu
[14:46:21] <Hoder> Weird, it's not giving me a new link
[14:46:24] <Hoder> it is saved though
[14:46:30] <qakhan> about my question
[14:46:38] <robertmaxrees> Hoder hit escape while you're in the url bar.
[14:46:45] <robertmaxrees> qakhan huh?
[14:47:04] <robertmaxrees> qakhan just check trhe extension client-side.  have your server actually verify the file format.
[14:47:10] <Hoder> robertmaxrees nothing happened
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> try again in another window maybe?
[14:48:06] <Hoder> robertmaxrees  heres a collab link: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=BBbDeawjQ0
[14:48:09] <qakhan> i did not send file to server yet
[14:48:09] <Hoder> maube that will work
[14:48:17] <robertmaxrees> qakhan i'm saying you will need to.
[14:48:22] <qakhan> ok
[14:48:27] <robertmaxrees> Hoder basically, you want to know if office_location is defined?
[14:49:25] <Hoder> Well it gets defined, because it upgrades to the 2nd office
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> oh sorry, the score.
[14:49:43] <Hoder> but how can I check it everytime so it doesn't spam the congrats message anytime it's over 2k score?
[14:50:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9u8dhn74/
[14:50:27] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[14:51:13] <Hoder> So would I need to do that for every office?
[14:51:33] <robertmaxrees> i don't know your game so i don't know what that querstion means.
[14:51:50] <Hoder> If you open the console you will see it get played in the console
[14:52:20] <robertmaxrees> so this is some kind of random thing?
[14:52:32] <Hoder> after 2k, it upgrades the office to 2, then I want to update the office every time the player hits a certain score, but need to check back so it doesn't spam the congrats message
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> sec
[14:53:06] <Hoder> the random base comes from the answers chosen, it's to make it so choosing good answers will reward a player over bad, but has it so it can be scaled up
[14:53:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9u8dhn74/1/ so this?
[14:54:00] <Hoder> That seems to continually show the congrats message in console
[14:54:12] <Hoder> Only need it to show once, on the turn they exceedd 1500
[14:54:53] <robertmaxrees> running playGame() == 1 "turn"?
[14:54:59] <robertmaxrees> basically, oyu need to store state somewhere.
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> in a scope that doesn't get blasted by whatever.
[14:55:21] <Hoder> Yes, 1 playgame is considered 1 term
[14:56:00] <Hoder> Yeah, so as the game proresses I will need to check what office they are in + their score, to decide whether they get upgrades at the end of each term
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> sure - sounds about right.
[14:56:30] <Hoder> when they get upgraded, their bonus changes and I need it to only congratulate them once
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need to store that state in there somewhere.
[14:57:12] <Hoder> Ok, let me try something, 1 sec
[14:58:08] <aiena> I need some help. I need to bind almost the same function body to a set of id's. Only with certain characters changing. Here is an example https://jsfiddle.net/m2c9z8vk/1/ E.g. I want to bind id's foo-1, foo-2, foo-3 to the same function body only some other id's inside the function also follow this incremental pattern. WHen you click on the div's its says "foo-4" for all of them
[14:58:15] <aiena> How do I correctly do this ?
[14:58:57] <aiena> I thought this would work but I am not really comfy with JS
[14:59:15] <aiena> can you'll look at the fiddle and advice ?
[14:59:55] <robertmaxrees> aiena why thje for loop?
[15:00:05] <aiena> because of the id's
[15:00:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:00:13] <aiena> e.g. I have 6 id's foo-1 to foo-6
[15:00:15] <robertmaxrees> then use better calsses :)
[15:00:46] <aiena> robertmaxrees: I could use better classes but because of convininence for the backend I want this structure
[15:00:55] <aiena> it makes its easy to add foo-7 and foo08 in the future
[15:00:57] <robertmaxrees> how is that inconvenient for the backend.
[15:01:02] <aiena> foo-8
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> you just add a sahred class./
[15:01:08] <robertmaxrees> and then ditch the for lo0op entirely.
[15:01:20] <aiena> but there is no way to make it in the loop
[15:01:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:01:33] <aiena> because otherwise I need to repeat the same bbody 10 times for example
[15:01:42] <aiena> and propagate changes manually to all 10 individual functions
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:01:50] <robertmaxrees> whjy are youi changing functions?
[15:01:59] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out your example a little more?
[15:02:45] <aiena> e.g. just imagine foo-1.click(function(){//some very long function}); foo-2.click(function(){//same very long function with id changes});
[15:03:01] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:03:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do any of that.
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> you can get the ID of the thing that was clicked.
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> and work with that.
[15:03:31] <robertmaxrees> so you have 1 function instead of x amount.
[15:04:00] <aiena> can jquery do matching e.g. do this function for all id's starting with foo- followed by a number
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use classes instead.
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do that, but it's very slow.
[15:04:28] <robertmaxrees> and kind of awkward.
[15:04:32] <Hoder> Okay, so my question is what is the more elegant way to go about this so I can check the user's score at the end of each turn and upgrade accoridingly, without have 5 different if statements and 5 different variables? https://codepaste.net/azn4ex     robertmaxrees
[15:04:33] <robertmaxrees> whereas that's a natural case fo a calss.
[15:05:17] <aiena> by class I think you are talking about class inside HTML not JS
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> js can easily selkect html classes.
[15:05:51] <aiena> your not talking about OOP classes is what I meant
[15:05:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:06:19] <aiena> because JS does have them I think but never used them
[15:06:31] <robertmaxrees> you doin't need them here...
[15:07:11] <robertmaxrees> aiena https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m2c9z8vk/3/
[15:07:53] <aiena> robertmaxrees: I said almost same function not same function that is why ID is impt
[15:08:11] <robertmaxrees> aiena what changes in each one?
[15:08:15] <aiena> E.g. foo-1 will have JS update one hidden field following a similar pattern
[15:08:20] <robertmaxrees> Hoder you can use else ifs or switches if you want.
[15:08:22] <aiena> foo -2 updates another hidden field
[15:08:30] <aiena> but .foo
[15:08:36] <aiena> will update the same hidden field
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:08:42] <robertmaxrees> aiena not the case.
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> you can check the ID or a data attribute on the current element to know which input to updater.
[15:09:48] <robertmaxrees> Hoder you could create objects to hold playerStatus or w/e
[15:11:03] <aiena> ok but then I'd need to do some id stripping or something to extract the prefix so work backwards from the id to create components to build the id of the hidden input field but still its faster
[15:11:14] <Hoder> Alright, I'll look into switches, thanks for the help robertmaxrees
[15:11:18] <robertmaxrees> aiena or just use data attributes.
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> Hoder i'd use state obects btw.
[15:11:32] <robertmaxrees> since you want to store, well, state.
[15:11:59] <aiena> ok need to learn about those.
[15:12:31] <aiena> hmm with this I dont even need hidden input fields then
[15:12:47] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need hidden inputs?>
[15:12:58] <Hoder> Oh alright, so my object would be the player, and that would store their score, name, and office?
[15:13:19] <robertmaxrees> Hoder sure.  seems like it makes sense :)
[15:13:47] <aiena> robertmaxrees:  how do I use data atrribs with jquery 2.2.4 ?
[15:14:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:15:03] <Hoder> awesome, thanks!
[15:16:04] <aiena> robertmaxrees: hmm your class thing actually makes sense I would also be able to use the .each() function to loop over them to retreive their states on building the AJAX call to the backend
[15:16:24] <aiena> eliminates the need for for loops etc.
[15:16:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you really wanna use .map().get() there, but sure!
[15:16:27] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:16:29] <robertmaxrees> avoid for loops.
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> you generally don't need 'em.
[15:16:57] <aiena> .each() could do it with added flexibility of not needing to bother about the count
[15:18:41] <aiena> and boom my 7 hidden input fields go too thanks you saved my a headache now to try it and see how to get it working
[15:19:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[15:30:06] <aiena> robertmaxrees: Basically I have something like a mutiple choice. I use one hidden input field for a group of options where they are or so ony one piece of data can be selected. When it is multiple choice I was trying to find a solution
[15:30:25] <aiena> in an earlier approach I only had 4 so I used 4 hidden input fields
[15:30:40] <aiena> but this approach is better I think
[15:32:15] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[15:34:04] <aiena> robertmaxrees: kind of new to front end backend this is my first full project so I'm sure I have goofed up in front end and back end too. But I dont have time to rewrite the whole thing properly and there is no guarantee it will be better.
[15:54:20] <aiena1> robertmaxrees, hmm jqueries .data() does not add a "data-" attribute to the element ?
[15:54:29] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:54:37] <aiena1> eek
[15:55:10] <aiena1> so only way to know if its working right is to query it through jquery again
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> si.
[17:03:55] <AndresInSpace> Yo
[17:04:05] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:04:15] <AndresInSpace> is there a way to reference DOM element, without using the ID or class
[17:04:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have any attributes on it?
[17:04:43] <robertmaxrees> or any other differentiating factors?
[17:04:48] <AndresInSpace> no.
[17:05:07] <robertmaxrees> so then what makes it different from any other?
[17:05:19] <robertmaxrees> you can pass css selectors to $()
[17:05:54] <AndresInSpace> scenario: have 15 LI elements in my UL, i find the UL, iterate through children finding offset. The catch is that they are different rows.. I need to set each row height independant of the others
[17:06:18] <AndresInSpace> but they are all in same UL, thast the issue if i use class names itll change them all as they all share same class name/attributes
[17:06:18] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle showing this?
[17:07:18] <AndresInSpace> I guess the better way to ask is
[17:08:30] <AndresInSpace> the way you can see each item in your object when you console log it out, even if they share same class names, it only highlights that specific element
[17:09:25] <robertmaxrees> i mean, 'this' refers to the DOM node within an $.fn.each
[17:10:10] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not entirely sure what you're asking for.
[17:15:31] <Guest38770> Does anybody know of a jquery mobile themes site with lots of themes? I've found a couple of sites but they all list the same few themes.
[17:18:58] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/fwd2fw29/
[17:20:06] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace so you want them all to have the same minheight and maxheight?
[17:20:16] <AndresInSpace> Only the same rows
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "rows" - you mean each classname?
[17:20:58] <robertmaxrees> like, what do you mean by "same rows"?
[17:21:16] <AndresInSpace> The row the LI display on
[17:21:26] <AndresInSpace> in the fiddle is 3 per row
[17:21:38] <AndresInSpace> responsive design, it can be 4 per row, maybe 5 maybe 6 depending on screen size
[17:21:43] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:21:53] <AndresInSpace> you see what i mean?
[17:22:02] <robertmaxrees> this is funky because it's hard to determine what all is in one row.
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> without querying window size.
[17:22:27] <AndresInSpace> well
[17:22:33] <AndresInSpace> I am iterating through each child LI
[17:22:37] <AndresInSpace> and getting offsetTop
[17:23:00] <robertmaxrees> so really you want to get groupings based on an offset.
[17:24:11] <AndresInSpace> but then reference them outside the foreach without using classname/id
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> and this is to make everything per row have the same height, right?
[17:24:30] <AndresInSpace> (i know I could do it in the foreac and add my own class name for each 'row' i define)
[17:24:33] <AndresInSpace> yes
[17:24:39] <AndresInSpace> but each row is independant
[17:24:53] <AndresInSpace> like row 1 may be 100px height across th eboard, row2 may be 200px height, row3 100px
[17:24:54] <robertmaxrees> your issue is still determining rows.
[17:25:03] <robertmaxrees> that's really your problem.
[17:25:05] <AndresInSpace> that is not my issue
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> if you could reliably get those row groupings, this becomes trivial.
[17:25:28] <AndresInSpace> if($(this).offsetTop > prevOffsetTop)
[17:25:30] <AndresInSpace> easy ^
[17:25:39] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:25:42] <AndresInSpace> i can group them into an object
[17:25:43] <AndresInSpace> yea
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:26:12] <AndresInSpace> so can i reference them from the object and it will only update that specific element?
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> you want to update sets of elements at a time.  which is easy.
[17:26:53] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/32383709
[17:26:57] <robertmaxrees> something like this should work.
[17:29:03] <AndresInSpace> k thanks
[17:59:19] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees
[17:59:25] <robertmaxrees> das me
[17:59:30] <AndresInSpace> its https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:59:33] <AndresInSpace> what i was looking for
[17:59:44] <robertmaxrees> you want to refer to things by index?
[17:59:51] <AndresInSpace> lol yea
[17:59:53] <AndresInSpace> im good tho, thanks
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:59:58] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you just say that earlier?
[18:00:25] <AndresInSpace> guess it was in other chat
[18:00:25] <AndresInSpace> o well
[18:00:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:52:20] <acidjazz> so i have a full screen div w/ some drag/zoom handlers on it to move an image around, id like to put an SVG overlay on top but i dont want that overlay to interrupt the mouse handlers, is this possible?
[18:58:19] <Darmani> Hi everyone! I'm trying to hide an iframe with an X button inside it but my code doesn't do anything
[18:58:20] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ad9163f2affa3da898d98b1f0bebeb74
[18:59:35] <robertmaxrees> Darmani is the iframe on the same domain?
[19:00:14] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Sorry this is my first time working with iframe's, where would I find that out?
[19:00:24] <robertmaxrees> the source on the iframe.
[19:00:42] <robertmaxrees> so you have iframe src="someurlhere" right?
[19:01:15] <Darmani> oh yeah I see it. I think it is, let me paste in the gist.
[19:01:23] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:01:42] <robertmaxrees> so does the http://someurl.com part match the page you're on?
[19:01:52] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ad9163f2affa3da898d98b1f0bebeb74#file-chatroom-coffee-L47
[19:02:16] <robertmaxrees> okay - so next, i assume close-chat is inside the iframe right?
[19:02:29] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Yes sir ^^
[19:02:33] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6316979/selecting-an-element-in-iframe-jquery
[19:03:00] <Darmani> oh. It's not as simple as $("");?
[19:03:25] <robertmaxrees> basically, you need to do something like $('iframe').contents(), because there are some special rules about the way the browser handles that barriers.
[19:03:29] <robertmaxrees> *barrier
[19:04:24] <Darmani> gotcha.
[19:16:10] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ad9163f2affa3da898d98b1f0bebeb74#file-jquery-js
[19:16:16] <Darmani> I thought this was close but no cigar
[19:17:51] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for the element - var iframe_close_link = $('iframe').contents().find('.close-chat'); is what you want instead.
[19:19:30] <Darmani> oh cool got it
