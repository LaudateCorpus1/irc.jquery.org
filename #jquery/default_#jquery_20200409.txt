[09:49:31] <errorous> hello. How do I use parent $(this)?
[09:50:15] <errorous> as in elem.change( function( $.each(function(i){ //need $(this) from change() }) ) );
[10:00:17] <errorous> also, in which situation would $(this).text('foobar') not work?
[10:00:59] <errorous> $(this).text() returns proper value, but $(this).text('foobar') doesn't change it
[10:08:14] <thykka> errorous, what have you got so far?
[10:10:20] <errorous> thykka: http://dpaste.com/0SRAPNS
[10:10:52] <thykka> and the html?
[10:11:02] <errorous> thykka it's not changing
[10:11:17] <thykka> is this an <input class=".ginput_total_33">
[10:11:27] <errorous> thykka nope, span
[10:11:49] <errorous> <span class="ginput_total ginput_total_33" aria-live="polite">$ 0.00</span>
[10:13:32] <thykka> nothing obviously wrong with that, problem is likely elsewhere
[10:14:04] <errorous> thykka what could be wrong?
[10:14:11] <errorous> as in, what could have happened
[10:14:27] <thykka> too little information for meaningful answer
[10:18:23] <errorous> thykka, ok, but what could it be that it it's able to get text but not able to set iut
[10:18:57] <thykka> ...
[10:19:48] <errorous> does it mean that if I get $(this).text(), and it's a proper value, that $(this) is one elem?
[10:21:20] <thykka> probably
[10:22:09] <errorous> ohhhhhh, could it be that something else is binding an event to what I wanna change?
[10:22:13] <thykka> but as there's nothing inherently wrong with the part you've shown, the problem could be in figuratively anything else
[12:29:40] <kittonian> hi all. i am trying to find a carousel that will allow alt text for the img, a title and a description to be overlayed on each image, and be compatible across the board with desktop and mobile browsers. right now I have been using a very old version of jssor but I do not need all the functionality of the newest version, nor do I want to have to create my carousels in their application.
[12:29:58] <kittonian> the old version I'm using has issues loading the first image on some devices
[12:30:50] <kittonian> basically, what I want is exactly what is on https://architectureau.com/ at the top
