[00:05:00] <frojnd> Hi there.
[00:07:19] <frojnd> I add items from input to array like this: http://jsfiddle.net/howdre/kgQLG/ how would I list those items in a '#myDivID' ? I trired like this: $(#myDivID).append(result + ''); but it won't show in the div
[00:13:16] <Voyage> Is this incorrect ? <a href="/Crawler/Index?sortBy=name"><th>Name</th></a>
[00:23:07] <murosai_> im nto sure why my success callback function of ajaxSubmit contains <pre>{key :value}</pre>, in specific where does the <pre> come from?
[00:23:16] <murosai_> backend problem, or?
[00:25:04] <Rodael> Where are you reading the data?
[00:25:23] <Rodael> Browsers tend to add <pre> when displaying the data
[00:26:25] <murosai_> just debugging the js, success(data) {} and data contains this <pre> thing
[00:26:46] <murosai_> but looking at the requests in the net panel the response doesn't contain <pre>
[00:36:08] <gingitsune> Hi there I'm in a rather weird situation using the select2 plugin. Where the widget gets data in form of {id: (city), text: (text), airport: (airport)}. I want to set the airport value to a hidden field. Right now I'm using a 'change' event but that doesn't work all to well, because one city can have multiple airports.
[00:37:11] <gingitsune> I'f i would use the 'select2-selecting' event the value i get is the one before a new one is selected
[00:38:50] <gingitsune> I'm not using the airport as the idea, because there is a value such as All Airport in London etc
[00:39:15] <gingitsune> I will probably use the close event to get the result i want
[00:39:26] <gingitsune> Was wondering how would you solve such a issue
[00:40:34] <ilhami> hey
[00:40:44] <ilhami> how to append to json object with jquery?
[00:41:16] <ilhami> {"name":"sadasd","lastName":"sd","address":"sad","postCode":"sad","city":"sad","phone":"sad","email":"asd"}  how can I append to this?
[01:13:16] <Cork> ilhami: what do you mean append?
[01:13:30] <ilhami> add properties to the end of it
[01:21:22] <ilhami> $.extend doesnt work
[01:22:44] <Cork> ilhami: you need to parse the json to objects
[01:23:17] <Cork> ilhami: are you doing this in an ajax call?
[01:23:26] <ilhami> no?
[01:23:53] <ilhami> http://fpaste.org/93427/72046291/
[01:23:55] <ilhami> check it out
[01:24:17] <Cork> ilhami: so do the extend BEFORE you serialize it :)
[01:24:24] <Cork> json is a string
[01:24:29] <Cork> not an object
[01:24:51] <Cork> so for js to handle it easily you need to either do it before you serialize, or parse it from json
[01:24:55] <ilhami> so this is not json
[01:25:01] <ilhami> it's an object+
[01:25:11] <Cork> ilhami: line 8 is an object
[01:25:32] <Cork> the return from JSON.stringify is json
[01:25:38] <nhqe> lol
[01:25:43] <ilhami> but I tried to stringify the obj?
[01:25:46] <ilhami> aaah wait
[01:25:47] <ilhami> 2 sec
[01:25:53] <Cork> you never save the result
[01:26:56] <Cork> ilhami: and the names of line 2 and 3 is actually reverse
[01:27:06] <Cork> sessionStore returns json
[01:27:13] <Cork> and myJson is the parsed object
[01:27:58] <Cork> ilhami: also why don't you just do myJson.productName = name;
[01:28:05] <Cork> then you don't need to do $.extend
[01:28:09] <ilhami> I tried that.
[01:28:11] <ilhami> as well
[01:29:28] <Cork> ilhami: http://jsfiddle.net/k3GBN/
[01:31:35] <ilhami> 2 sec
[01:34:19] <ilhami> Trying now Cork
[01:34:52] <ilhami> it worked :D thank you
[01:35:17] <Cork> ilhami: you encoded the json on line two
[01:35:20] <Cork> and then decoded it again
[01:35:35] <Cork> so you double encoded a json string as json
[01:35:38] <Cork> and then decoded it again
[01:35:48] <Cork> so the rest of the code could never work with it
[02:09:24] <amigojapan> hi, I am doing 	$.get("savetest.php",function(data,status){alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);});  but it appearss as if data is an empty array, I really want to do $.post but I get simillar results, any ideas?
[02:10:35] <Cork> amigojapan: what does the server return?
[02:11:03] <amigojapan> Cork: apparently nothing,  but when I access savetest.php it says hello world
[02:11:27] <Cork> amigojapan: and what is the content-type header?
[02:11:52] <amigojapan> hmmm, I guess it hsould be text,   how do I specify it?
[02:12:19] <Cork> <?php header('Content-Type: text/plain'); ?>
[02:12:31] <amigojapan> thanks, let me try it
[02:14:46] <interop_madness> when (de)-serializing DateTimes for $.ajax() calls, what of the following two options is the best practice?:
[02:15:04] <amigojapan> Cork: I added it to my php script,  but still I get, in my alert, it just says Data: Array()1 Status:Success... I really want to see the hello world in there
[02:15:18] <interop_madness> 1.) Webservice returns all DateTimes as UTC, client converts to browser local timezone, client sends datetimes with browser local timezone
[02:15:36] <interop_madness> 1.) Webservice returns all DateTimes with server timezone, client converts to browser local timezone, client sends datetimes with browser local timezone
[02:15:40] <interop_madness> 2.*
[02:16:01] <Cork> amigojapan: only thing i can say is; you shouldn't
[02:16:18] <Cork> amigojapan: would have to see the site in action to tell what happens
[02:16:43] <amigojapan> Cork: this is the PHP http://amigojapan.duckdns.org/easypageeditor/satvetest.php
[02:17:46] <Cork> interop_madness: i recommend returning utc in rfc2822 format
[02:17:58] <amigojapan> Cork: let me make a small example with just what I am asking, and I will come back
[02:18:01] <Cork> and from there converting it to what ever format you need
[02:18:30] <Cork> amigojapan: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15
[02:18:38] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[02:18:43] <Cork> interop_madness: ^
[02:18:46] <amigojapan> ok
[02:21:02] <interop_madness> Cork, but the deserialization of JSON to a javascript Date object will not be done automatically, right? i still have to parse the string on the clientside...
[02:21:39] <Cork> interop_madness: Date(data.date)
[02:21:54] <interop_madness> ok so it's not implicit
[02:22:00] <Cork> but if you need to convert it to local timezone you want to do that either way
[02:22:03] <Cork> no
[02:22:05] <interop_madness> ok
[02:22:10] <Cork> at least not as far as i know
[02:22:26] <Cork> interop_madness: but that format is supported by the Date object
[02:22:30] <Cork> many other format isn't
[02:23:31] <amigojapan> yeah Cork take a look, here is the jquery http://amigojapan.duckdns.org/easypageeditor/jquerytest.html    this is the php ouput http://amigojapan.duckdns.org/easypageeditor/satvetest.php
[02:24:25] <amigojapan> wait
[02:24:32] <amigojapan> maybe the page name is wrong...
[02:24:39] <amigojapan> satvetest...
[02:24:41] <amigojapan> hold on
[02:25:42] <Cork> amigojapan: </html?>
[02:25:47] <Cork> why the ?
[02:25:59] <amigojapan> typo
[02:26:22] <amigojapan> I fixed that
[02:26:46] <amigojapan> oh my god Cork I see what it wrong!
[02:26:55] <amigojapan> sorry to bother you
[02:27:24] <amigojapan> the PHP page itself was retuning Arrat()1, I have 2 misspelled php pages
[02:35:55] <amigojapan> typos are my worst enemy :(
[02:38:12] <Cork> amigojapan: don't forget to fix the </html?> tag
[02:38:36] <amigojapan> Cork: already did, and that is just in the test thinggy
[02:40:29] <amigojapan> Cork: problem was I had 2 php files with simillar names,   one of the files was returning Array()1     which I thouhgt was an error on my jquery, but it was just that I was looking at teh wrong php file, and trying to fix teh problem on another php file with a simillar nbame
[02:41:46] <amigojapan> so nomatter how much I edited, I got the output of the original file
[02:41:54] <Cork> :)
[02:42:06] <amigojapan> :)
[02:43:34] <amigojapan> about 3 hours wasted... oh well
[02:56:22] <wizard_A> i'm getting  [["11500110003"],["11500110004"],...]  as ajax respose. Now how do i access each individual element in jQuery/javascript??
[02:56:53] <Cork> data[0][0] would be the first string
[02:57:02] <Cork> data[1][0] would be the second string
[02:57:04] <Cork> and so on
[03:03:22] <effortDee> hi Cork
[03:04:10] <effortDee> i'm wanting a page which is a horizontal web page to be scrolled automatically is jquery what i need for this?
[03:04:20] <effortDee> i need to get a certain scrolling speed too
[03:05:10] <Cork> effortDee: you can do it with .animate({ scrollTop: '+=10' }, 100) for example
[03:05:16] <decx> first you need a plan
[03:05:32] <effortDee> yer just realised that it will be animate
[03:05:40] <effortDee> thanks Cork, so its simple
[03:05:58] <effortDee> it can do it on page load? As i have a css animation that moves and i want it to move with the animation :)
[03:06:11] <decx> i doubt scrolltop will work on a horizontal page?
[03:06:47] <effortDee> oh yer its horizontal
[03:08:03] <decx> you can animate the offset, but translate3d will give better performance
[03:08:11] <effortDee> ah right
[03:08:20] <effortDee> i suppose i could do it with keyframes with css anywya
[03:08:23] <effortDee> ill have a think
[03:08:27] <effortDee> thanks guys, as always :)
[03:08:40] <decx> like i said, you need a plan for your ux first
[03:09:06] <decx> autoscroll, scroll on userinput, stop scroll on focus on specific elements, there is much that can be done wrong
[03:09:51] <decx> especially on a project with unexpected behaviour
[03:10:42] <decx> my tests from horizontal pages concluded that only experienced users or coders even noticed the rest of the horizontal content
[03:11:36] <effortDee> decx
[03:11:47] <effortDee> my animation will go off to the right
[03:11:56] <effortDee> and i will have an intro message saying what will happen
[03:12:16] <effortDee> so that info will pop up and then it will start
[03:12:29] <effortDee> and the auto scroll will go right for the user, so they don't have to move anything
[03:17:49] <wizard_A> Cork: no its giving undefined...
[03:18:02] <wizard_A> it gives undefined. response[0]='[' response[1]='[' response[2]='"' response[3]='1' and so on..
[03:20:59] <wizard_A> no soory not undefined but but response is same as above line..
[03:23:35] <Cork> wizard_A: then your server isn't setting the correct content-type
[03:24:16] <Cork> wizard_A: fix the server to set Content-Type: application/json
[03:24:24] <Cork> and you will have the effect your expecting
[03:27:06] <wizard_A> hey Cork thanks a lot that fixed the issue, thanks a lot :)
[04:00:16] <kennethd> This line of code works in my app, but not under test with qunit: $(".genre_tree_node[genre_id='genre_011']").find(".genre_tree_delete").click();
[04:01:15] <kennethd> I have put a "stop();" in the test & inspected the qunit-fixture div to verify the dom elements are there
[04:01:25] <kennethd> and indeed, console.log($(".genre_tree_node[genre_id='genre_011']").find(".genre_tree_delete").attr("node_id")); works
[04:27:35] <td_> Hi. In jQuery 1.11, jQuery fails to work on objects that got a length attribute set to 0. This is because the isArrayLike function returns true in this case
[04:27:46] <td_> example: jQuery({length:0}) -> []
[04:28:36] <td_> Anyone got an explanation why obj.length == 0 means it is "array like"?
[04:39:49] <Cork> td_: most likely to catch empty jquery objects
[04:39:57] <Cork> td_: but why is this causing you problems?
[04:43:52] <krambiorix> hi, i have a bunch of input fields with various validations on it depending on the id and class of the input field.  Eg. If a field amount is < 0 -> value_error . If that same field has a non numeric value in it -> value_error ... and so on.  The validation checks can be in multiple functions... When the field is < 0 , i add the value_error class. But it could be that another function that executes after that, will check if the value is a number and
[04:43:53] <krambiorix>  will remove the class value_error. This is not correct because the value is still smaller than 0 ... How can i take care of this?
[04:44:22] <td_> Cork: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14990
[04:44:48] <Cork> td_: that doesn't answer the question
[04:44:54] <Cork> why is this causing you a problem?
[04:47:08] <td_> Cork: because if you got code like jQuery(element).on(...) and the event does not trigger and no error occours you get a nasty problem to debug
[04:47:42] <Cork> td_: what you do expect?
[04:47:47] <Cork> it to crash?
[04:48:09] <td_> i expect {length:0} not to be "array like"
[04:48:18] <td_> because it really is not an array
[04:48:26] <Cork> td_: can you make this less abstract?
[04:48:40] <Cork> what does {length:0} have to do with element?
[04:48:54] <td_> element = {length: 0}
[04:49:02] <td_> boom.
[04:49:16] <Cork> well $() is basically {length:0}
[04:49:28] <Cork> so if {length:0} wasn't accepted $() would break
[04:49:30] <td_> it is just the simplest example to trigger the problem
[04:49:51] <Cork> the problem, is i don't see the problem yet
[04:50:01] <td_> $() == $({length: 0}) ?!
[04:50:07] <krambiorix> Cork , any idea?
[04:50:14] <Cork> $() ~= {length:0}
[04:50:26] <Cork> with a few functions attached and a prototype from array
[04:51:05] <Cork> td_: so your basically asking to break jqobj = $('selector'); $(jqObj)
[04:51:57] <td_> Cork: wait a sec, let me check the code
[04:52:41] <Cork> td_: one of the base problems is that there isn't a good way to check if an object is an array
[04:53:42] <interop_madness>  is javascript's Date API horrible or am i missing something?
[04:54:38] <Cork> interop_madness: it's horrible
[04:54:43] <Cork> exceptionally horrible
[04:54:45] <interop_madness> i mean seriously
[04:54:53] <interop_madness> it seems intentionally bad
[04:54:54] <td_> jqobj = $('selector'); $(jqObj) <-- why would that break? If 'selector' did match soemthing length would be great 0 and not run into the case, if it did not match anything doing $([]) would still work since you get [] back in any case
[04:55:33] <Cork> td_: $() generates a jquery object, with no added elements
[04:55:44] <Cork> $([]) basically does the same thing
[04:56:00] <Cork> jquery IS NOT using arrays internally for keeping the elements
[04:56:57] <td_> Cork: so?
[04:57:17] <Cork> td_: so if $('selector') didn't match anything
[04:57:19] <td_> $('#foo').length = 1, if #foo exists,
[04:57:29] <Cork> you would have { legnth: 0 }
[04:57:43] <Cork> and jquery is expected to not crash on that
[04:57:51] <Cork> that is BY DESIGN
[04:59:09] <td_> so the problem is, that $($('$does-not-exists')) results into a problem?
[04:59:56] <Cork> no the second wrapping should see the empty first jquery object and just pass that forward
[05:02:03] <td_> Cork: looking at isArraylike( obj ) there is the check  length === 0 || at the end
[05:02:48] <td_> so if the only reason this exists is that the function does recongnices an empty jquery object as an array, why not check exactly that with something like "obj instanceof jQuery" ?
[05:02:53] <td_> that would not break your case
[05:02:59] <Cork> not the only case no
[05:03:23] <Cork> but checking if length exist to sniff for arrays is common
[05:03:30] <Cork> not just jquery does it
[05:03:40] <Cork> and again, i don't get why this is a problem
[05:03:47] <Cork> you still haven't explained why
[05:03:55] <td_> Cork: yeah but {length:1} is not array like? but {length:0} is?
[05:04:13] <Cork> td_: well not if it doesn't exist a key for it
[05:05:01] <Cork> td_: notice the ( length - 1 ) in obj check
[05:06:12] <td_> Cork: i meant it litarraly. isArraylike( {length:1} ) -> false
[05:06:17] <Cork> yes
[05:06:38] <Cork> but { "0": "a", length: 1 } is
[05:07:24] <td_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/C9QJq/
[05:07:47] <td_> here a full example of what might produce problems
[05:08:02] <Cork> ah, you binding events on random objects
[05:08:09] <Cork> *you're
[05:09:20] <Cork> td_: i see why that would be a problem; but i'm not sure if binding events like that has ever really been supported
[05:09:42] <Cork> but ya, can't answer that
[05:11:11] <luckyruby> Hi, can someone tell me if this is a bug in jquery or if I'm just doing something stupid? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/nyuIa/
[05:11:23] <td_> Cork: here a second example: http://jsfiddle.net/E2z8T/
[05:11:36] <td_> of which I am pretty sure is supported ;)
[05:11:44] <td_> or should be
[05:12:05] <Cork> td_: ya, but that is expected
[05:12:17] <td_> it is?
[05:12:29] <Cork> td_: you should avoid the use of length if you don't want to fake being an array
[05:12:36] <Cork> use size or similar instead
[05:12:44] <Cork> lots of script will behave like that
[05:12:59] <td_> Cork: well "length" is not an uncommon word to find in data
[05:14:23] <td_> Cork: I added those two jsfiddle links to my bug report
[05:17:06] <luckyruby> if I enclose the buttons in a div, then it works as expected. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pwels/
[05:19:39] <Donitz> Almost as crowded. Hello
[05:24:11] <Donitz> I'm wondering. I need to create a slideshow of pages which contain several images and graphs and text
[05:24:11] <Donitz> What is a good way of doing this in jquery? Pre-creating all the layout in php files and using seperate .js scripts?
[05:24:11] <Donitz> or creating the content directly in javascript and jquery
[05:24:11] <Cork> luckyruby: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/nyuIa/
[05:24:11] <Cork> opps
[05:24:11] <Cork> sorry
[05:24:12] <Cork> luckyruby: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/inEwI/
[05:24:12] <luckyruby> Cork: ah
[05:24:12] <eni23> hei guyse. someone knows how to not scroll the page if mouse is over an specific element?
[05:24:12] <luckyruby> thank you for that
[05:28:04] <Donitz> Would you ever recommend using jquery ui tabs without the header for automatic rotating content for a kiosk?
[05:28:26] <Jattenalle> a carousel?
[05:28:40] <ankurk_> Donitz: I wouldn't recommend using jQuery UI in first place
[05:28:41] <Jattenalle> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[05:28:48] <ankurk_> it's UI is horrible
[05:28:54] <Donitz> ah
[05:28:57] <Jattenalle> ankurk_, oh? how so?
[05:29:00] <Donitz> Well I still need jquery for flot
[05:29:09] <Donitz> but not jquery UI I guess
[05:29:22] <ankurk_> well, it's just my view, I don't really like the UI
[05:29:34] <Jattenalle> ankurk_, what do you mean though? the theme (CSS) ?
[05:29:38] <rvrsh3ll> what do you recommend in place of jquery-ui?
[05:29:40] <ankurk_> yep CSS
[05:29:49] <ankurk_> bootstrap or foundation
[05:29:59] <Jattenalle> ankurk_, well you can easily change that.. vanilla jquery ui css is a bit horrible looking for sure
[05:30:24] <Donitz> A carousel is fine for kiosks
[05:30:29] <Donitz> how else would it work
[05:30:49] <Jattenalle> Donitz, assuming the kiosk has no input, sure, obviously
[05:31:11] <Donitz> The thing about the slides I need to make is each one will have live content and html + css formatting
[05:31:31] <Donitz> so I need a good way to switch both the html content and script without reloading the page
[05:31:49] <Jattenalle> easy enough with .hide() and .show() if you want to roll your own
[05:31:53] <Donitz> I figured if I could make one .js file for each page
[05:32:06] <Donitz> and somehow create the html content inside this script in like a createHtml function
[05:32:24] <Donitz> and then have an update function for that script only
[05:32:25] <ankurk_> Donitz: try to avoid writing HTML in JS files
[05:32:37] <Donitz> I know right, but what else should I do?
[05:32:38] <ankurk_> try to keep JS and HTML separate
[05:32:46] <Donitz> Have one html file and one .js file for each page?
[05:32:59] <ankurk_> why would you do that?
[05:33:19] <Donitz> because I want to seperate page content from the ... well, index content
[05:33:27] <Jattenalle> you can have all the "carousel" pages in one file, as <div>'s or whatever
[05:33:30] <Donitz> I want pages to be self-contained so to say
[05:33:35] <Jattenalle> then just show the relevant one
[05:33:58] <ankurk_> and you should use libraries like this, http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[05:34:03] <Jattenalle> have them all display:none; or .hide(); then just show the one you want to show based on time or somesuch
[05:34:04] <Jattenalle> easy enough
[05:34:18] <Donitz> I understand that, but then all the different pages get mixed up in the same file
[05:34:40] <ankurk_> separate them using <div> tags
[05:34:44] <Jattenalle> well, if you want to keep the content all separate, you can fetch it with ajax i guess
[05:34:53] <Jattenalle> then you can put them all in their own files.. if you really want
[05:35:02] <Jattenalle> could even have them on a different server to truly make them "live"
[05:35:10] <Donitz> Well, can't I like... embed them all using php when the page loads?
[05:35:21] <Jattenalle> yeah, that's what we're saying
[05:35:24] <Donitz> Then they're all in the same file when loaded, but in seperate files on the server
[05:35:24] <Jattenalle> you can do that just fine
[05:35:30] <Jattenalle> sure, that's fine
[05:35:53] <Donitz> so I guess page1.include.html + page1.include.js for each page then
[05:35:56] <Donitz> should work I suppose
[05:36:19] <Donitz> since each page will have some very unique scripts
[05:36:24] <Jattenalle> without knowing what you want to do, exactly (ie, the actual pages) sure
[05:36:51] <Jattenalle> yeah if they all need unique JS, then you obviously need to do it the way you say.. you can still bake it all into a single file though.. if you really want
[05:37:01] <Jattenalle> in the end i guess it comes down to: how much work do you wanna spend on it? :P
[05:37:05] <Jattenalle> work/time*
[05:37:22] <Donitz> I want the people I make it for to be able to maintain it without my help
[05:37:33] <Jattenalle> then separate files for sure
[05:37:34] <Donitz> so I don't want them to mess around with the main logic
[05:51:53] <seutje> hm, weird... on an old jquery UI datepicker implementation, if I press enter on any field, the datepicker will pop up, if I set a breakpoint on all keydown listeners, hit enter, and let the interpreter continue right away, the datepicker doesn't show up o.O
[05:53:28] <seutje> also, I tried to attach a keydown handler to the form, but that doesn't seem to be executed at all, additionally, when going up from the field to the form, I don't encounter any other handlers that might be eating my event
[06:09:24] <fattest> is there anything i can do to make this popover be infront of every element? z-index isn't working through css...http://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/VUZhL/
[06:16:34] <Cork> fattest: is this what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/VUZhL/271/
[06:18:45] <fattest> Cork: shouldn't the position be absolute if you want it to in front of others
[06:19:05] <Cork> fattest: no absolute is if you want it to not follow the page flow
[06:19:14] <Cork> relative lets you set z-index too
[06:19:32] <fattest> ohh
[06:19:42] <fattest> so if your position is absolute, then z index won't work?
[06:22:47] <Cork> fattest: z-index works for fixed, absolute and relative
[06:23:07] <Cork> basically it works for everything except static
[06:25:48] <DansVC> HI :D
[06:26:34] <DansVC> Some english here?
[06:27:07] <Cork> ?ask @ DansVC
[06:27:07] <b-ot> DansVC: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:29:12] <DansVC> sorry, "Draw again" is well in english?
[06:29:48] <Cork> Redraw
[06:30:07] <DansVC> thanks Cork ;)
[06:30:42] <Cork> DansVC: though i'm not native english speaking
[06:30:48] <Cork> but that one was simple enough :)
[06:31:25] <DansVC> kk
[06:45:51] <DansVC> Now I'm curious, swipe dont mean to beat?
[07:06:19] <JamesH_> Hi, does anyone know when this fix in jquery is going to be released?  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9166
[07:06:19] <skullcrasher> how do i write my own plugin???
[07:06:24] <skullcrasher> i found this
[07:06:26] <skullcrasher> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[07:06:44] <skullcrasher> but my plugin won't work :(
[07:06:59] <skullcrasher> although it's quite simple
[07:07:32] <skullcrasher> http://pastie.org/9072975
[07:08:26] <andrewSC> hi all
[07:08:30] <saml> hello
[07:08:41] <saml> how can i select all elements with background image?
[07:08:43] <skullcrasher> could anyone give me a direction where my error is?
[07:08:49] <saml> should i do jQuery('*').each ?
[07:10:35] <andrewSC> After reading the documentation on the .on event handler function, when i do something like $element.on('click, '.cool-class', function(){});, and the .cool-class class itself isn't a child of $element in the DOM at the time I declare the handler, will the handler fire at a later time when the DOM does have .cool-class as a child of $element?
[07:10:55] <BillCriswell> saml: You could do that... could be expensive though.
[07:11:04] <andrewSC> or does .cool-class need to be in the DON at the time I declare the handler?
[07:11:09] <andrewSC> DOM*
[07:11:22] <saml> jQuery('*').each(function() { if (this.style.backgroundImage) { console.log(this.style.backgroundImage);}});     doesn't work
[07:11:43] <andrewSC> the documentation seems to imply that it doesn't have to be there and the handler should fire at a later time when the class does exist but I'm not experiencing that
[07:11:55] <saml> i just want to run it  once for testing. it can be expensive
[07:12:02] <fattest> I've been working on this for a while, but do you have any idea why the pop over is coming over the time line events? I want it to go behind http://kalikiri.ipage.com/test/summoner.php?id=5908&region=na screenshot http://uploadnow.org/image/354451-Screenshot.png Cork
[07:12:39] <saml> oh $('*') is top level
[07:12:40] <BillCriswell> saml: What is that returning?
[07:12:47] <BillCriswell> saml: That's EVERYTHING.
[07:12:58] <BillCriswell> What's it returning in the console*
[07:13:22] <saml> many elements
[07:13:47] <BillCriswell> saml: No I mean this.style.backgroundImage
[07:13:51] <JamesH_> is there an expected release date for jquery ui 1.11?
[07:13:54] <saml> BillCriswell, ''
[07:15:05] <saml> document.getElementById('footer').style.backgroundImage    oh this returns '' as well  on this page  https://www.h1z1.com/home
[07:15:17] <saml> so weird
[07:15:35] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[07:16:42] <BillCriswell> saml: http://jsbin.com/zakuropi/1/edit This is working.
[07:17:02] <BillCriswell> Not sure what backgroundImage is doing.
[07:17:58] <saml> BillCriswell, oh nice
[07:20:01] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: Any idea why here: http://pastebin.com/kTNZv1Wf
[07:20:08] <BillCriswell> I must not be understand this.style right.
[07:20:13] <Genesis_> line 10 and 11 are giving me "unvaught typerrror: undefined is not a function"
[07:20:28] <Genesis_> I thought I was calling those functions properly
[07:22:08] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: Are you trying to use push and unshift on a string?
[07:22:22] <freeone3000> Using JQuery UI, I'm getting "TypeError: Object [objcet Object] has no method 'modal'" when executing https://gist.github.com/freeone3000/aff9801abb45fb8e5940 . Why?
[07:22:29] <Genesis_> yes, whatever data is
[07:22:34] <Genesis_> which to my knowledge is a string.
[07:22:39] <freeone3000> I've looked at the stackoverflow links, and most of these problems are caused by double-including jquery, but I've been over my source and I don't do that.
[07:23:24] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: push and unshift is for arrays.
[07:23:36] <Genesis_> aren't all string arrays in jquery?
[07:25:24] <BillCriswell> Not really I don't think. I mean you can access letters individually but you can't work with them like a typical array.
[07:26:26] <freeone3000> Ah. Some genius saw "Jquery UI 1.10.3? I must have the wrong jquery version, that should be 1.10.3 too!"
[07:26:37] <Genesis_> gotcha
[07:26:39] <Genesis_> thank you
[07:27:02] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:27:08] <freeone3000> ..Though that should work, since 1.10.3 is greater than 1.6.
[07:31:40] <BillCriswell> freeone3000: Is is a custom build of jquery ui?
[07:31:44] <BillCriswell> Might just not have modal in there.
[07:35:39] <freeone3000> BillCriswell: Ah. Yes, it is. Didn't have modal in the filename. Rebuilding.
[07:38:00] <star_prone> is there a way to add an object of options to jqueryui's modal forms?
[07:40:52] <freeone3000> BillCriswell: Nope, just did a rebuild, included everything. Same error.
[07:42:43] <BillCriswell> freeone3000: Are you sure you're trying it on a jQuery element?
[07:42:59] <BillCriswell> It wouldn't work on a DOM element, it would have to be a DOM element wrapped with jQuery.
[07:48:01] <dunkel2> hello
[07:48:40] <dunkel2> how can i append different copies of a dom im getting in a function?
[07:49:17] <dunkel2> i get something ike this onrendered: function (canvas) { and i want to append that canvas to several items but it is just apending to the last selector
[07:49:35] <dunkel2> and canvas is not a jquery object so i cant use clone
[07:52:06] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: What is it? A string? DOM element?
[07:52:13] <dunkel2> i think is  a DOM
[07:52:23] <dunkel2> it contains <canvas>
[07:53:04] <BillCriswell> Do you have a demo somewhere? I feel like I might be missing someothing.
[07:53:43] <dunkel2> let me do something small in fiddle but im just using this look
[07:53:56] <dunkel2> http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/examples.html
[07:54:05] <dunkel2> its html2canvas
[07:54:13] <dunkel2> and on the onrendered function
[07:54:20] <dunkel2> it gets the generated canvas
[07:54:43] <dunkel2> so inside that function i have this $(".sub-menu").append(canvas);
[07:55:05] <dunkel2> but it just append the image in the last item with the seletor .sub-menu
[07:55:13] <dunkel2> so i think i have to copy it or clone it
[07:55:25] <dunkel2> so each item with that selector gets the canvas inside
[07:59:18] <DansVC> Hi I need help with one thing
[07:59:30] <DansVC> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/YkrWL/
[07:59:44] <DansVC> that works fine in the desktop
[08:00:06] <DansVC> but in my tablet it happens a extra point and I dont know why
[08:00:59] <DansVC> If someone could help me I will be very thanks
[08:01:06] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: You could do var canvasClone = $(canvas).clone(); I believe.
[08:01:23] <dunkel2> let me try
[08:02:16] <dunkel2> BillCriswell: no, now it is not showing the image on any of them
[08:03:16] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: I would need to see exactly what was going on then.
[08:14:34] <BillCriswell> Anyone use jquery.simulate.js? Trying to set up like a demo screen to illustrate how to work something. I have it working for the most part but it happens quickly. Before I touch the plugins code itself I wnted to see if anyone knew if I was just doing something weird.
[08:15:49] <krambiorix> hi, i have a bunch of input fields with various validations on it depending on the id and class of the input field.  Eg. If a field amount is < 0 -> value_error . If that same field has a non numeric value in it -> value_error ... and so on.  The validation checks can be in multiple functions... When the field is < 0 , i add the value_error class. But it could be that another function that executes after that, will check if the value is a number and
[08:15:49] <krambiorix>  will remove the class value_error. This is not correct because the value is still smaller than 0 ... How can i take care of this?
[08:16:14] <skullcrasher> if i append a div to another and then set text to that div, the width is not changing. Do I have to call anything to resize after inserting the text?
[08:16:30] <star_prone> does anyone know how I can set the options of a jqueryui dialog in one statement
[08:16:32] <star_prone> ?
[08:16:34] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: That doesn't sound right.
[08:16:41] <star_prone> I have an object with all the options
[08:17:03] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: http://pastie.org/9073155
[08:17:11] <skullcrasher> this is the plugin code i try to do
[08:17:56] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: A div is a block level element. If you want the element to get bigger as the content changes you would need to use an inline or inline-block element ( with no width set ).
[08:20:51] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: well, after resizing the browser window and back it shows right
[08:22:28] <skullcrasher> but not initially
[08:24:30] <BillCriswell> It seems like something odd is going on though?
[08:24:48] <BillCriswell> See if running $(window).trigger('resize'); does anything after you add the text.
[08:25:29] <SprkDev> Hi I have a very simple problem. I am using this plugin to crop images. http://www.croppic.net/. But instead of it being a rectangle I want it to be a box as in 300 x 300 px. I've chaged the style size in css, but it woudn't crop properly.
[08:33:40] <vikash> Say, I have an input box (a type ahead module), Lets say user types Foo and hover on foobar in the dropdown, which becomes the .val() for the input box now. Is there a way that could fetch me just the foo and not foo bar. [I believe browers implement in some way]
[08:34:36] <dunkel2> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/gPZL8/ this is not the best example but if you see until you go to the Additional services menu, you get the canvas drawn at the very bottom
[08:35:38] <BillCriswell> Ugh, drupal classes.
[08:36:08] <dunkel2> wordpress :(
[08:36:20] <BillCriswell> Ugh. HAha
[08:36:30] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: http://jsfiddle.net/gPZL8/1/ how about this?
[08:36:53] <BillCriswell> Blah, have to add $(this) before .append()
[08:38:25] <dunkel2> same result :(
[08:40:45] <dunkel2> just adding it to the last element
[08:47:46] <dunkel2> BillCriswell: i think the problem is that all the items have the canvas but only the last renders the image on it
[08:49:29] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: Hard to tell without the real thing in front of me in this case.
[08:49:39] <dunkel2> :(
[08:51:02] <duch_kazatel> whuddup friday
[08:52:39] <dunkel2> or do you have any better idea of how can i implement a blur in the drop down menues background
[08:52:52] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[08:53:20] <ezrafree> blur a background? whaaa?
[08:53:24] <dunkel2> no
[08:53:26] <duch_kazatel> i was late to the party.
[08:53:56] <ezrafree> duch_kazatel: story of my life.
[08:54:03] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[08:54:15] <dunkel2> blur what is behing a div this div is shown as a result of a link hover like a dropdown menu
[08:54:41] <duch_kazatel> define "blur"
[08:55:05] <ezrafree> i'm thinking you don't mean .blur() from jquery here...
[08:55:25] <dunkel2> ios7 blur effect
[08:55:44] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a visual effect?
[08:55:48] <dunkel2> yep
[08:55:56] <dunkel2> like this http://jsfiddle.net/nallenscott/WtQjY/41/
[08:56:11] <dunkel2> but just for some drop downs
[08:56:19] <dunkel2> not a fixed div on screen
[08:56:51] <duch_kazatel> that's... trivial.
[08:57:02] <ezrafree> dunkel2: its hard to say much without seeing any code, but i assume the dropdown menu has a css background-image applied to it?
[08:57:40] <ezrafree> or you want the dropdown menu to look like frosted glass so people could barely see the images behind it?
[08:57:48] <dunkel2> yes
[08:57:51] <dunkel2> frosted glass
[08:58:00] <duch_kazatel> dunkel2 that's canvas at play.  easy to implement.
[08:58:11] <dunkel2> well im trying the html2canvas
[08:58:15] <duch_kazatel> at least in this case.
[08:58:26] <dunkel2> but i have like 5 .sub-menu
[08:58:32] <dunkel2> items where i want to add the canvas
[08:58:36] <dunkel2> and frost it
[08:58:46] <duch_kazatel> did you figure out how to do it to one?
[08:58:48] <dunkel2> but it just applies the image to the last cnvas
[08:59:25] <duch_kazatel> you probably have to loop through them all and do them one at a time manually.
[09:00:55] <dunkel2> BillCriswell told me to use the .each but im getting the same results
[09:01:24] <duch_kazatel> do you have an example trying to use it?
[09:02:47] <decx> how does html2canvas even work, does it implement its own html parser and rendering engine?
[09:02:52] <decx> seems ridiculous
[09:03:13] <duch_kazatel> 5 bucks says he's using that because he found an example that does exactly what he thinks he wants.
[09:03:21] <duch_kazatel> not because he's actually using the featureset.
[09:03:46] <decx> i'd check the fiddle but base64 for large images makes jsfiddle crap itself
[09:03:56] <duch_kazatel> works for me on my end.
[09:04:26] <decx> well it works, but it's slower than usual
[09:04:35] <duch_kazatel> ah
[09:05:32] <decx> frosted menu?
[09:05:42] <decx> what does that mean
[09:06:22] <dunkel2> it means then the menu is shown
[09:06:29] <dunkel2> it frosts the content behind it
[09:06:37] <dunkel2> :(
[09:07:02] <decx> apply an svg effect to your html
[09:07:10] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Applying_SVG_effects_to_HTML_content
[09:07:59] <BillCriswell> Did you ever know you're having a brain fart but just can't figure out what it is? Having that right now.
[09:08:30] <decx> told you not to smoke my dank
[09:08:49] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:08:53] <dunkel2> but the filter will  blur my div? not what is behind it?
[09:09:35] <BillCriswell> lol got it.
[09:09:42] <decx> svg effects are a bit convoluted, but you'll be better of than trying to parse html into canvas and blur it there
[09:10:26] <systemfault> dunkel2: It’s impossible to blur something behind a div.
[09:11:15] <dunkel2> so my idea is to take the canvas screenshot get just the area that is in that div, set that as backgroundof the div and blur it, does that sounds correct? i just need to find out how to implement it :S
[09:11:41] <dunkel2> do you think that approach would consume lot of resources?
[09:11:51] <BillCriswell> lol http://css-tricks.com/blurry-background-effect/
[09:11:59] <BillCriswell> Thanks Chris.
[09:12:29] <decx> haha
[09:12:46] <BillCriswell> I am so glad it isn't 6 years ago.
[09:13:10] <BillCriswell> dunkel2: How about you make like a noisy png with random transparency?
[09:13:53] <BillCriswell> Wait I'm thinking like... frosted window effect.
[09:14:28] <dunkel2> mmm i should try to see the result
[09:17:32] <decx> prepare to be dazzled
[09:17:33] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3Gx8b/
[09:18:05] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[09:18:55] <BillCriswell> decx: How about you clone that div, put it on top of the original, set the height of the clone to the height of the dropdown with overflow hidden
[09:19:05] <BillCriswell> BOOM blurred background, done grossly.
[09:19:46] <decx> no
[09:20:23] <BillCriswell> ... FINE
[09:22:27] <duch_kazatel> fridays in here are the best.
[09:23:21] <BillCriswell> Why is it so hard to fine a noisy png online.
[09:23:37] <duch_kazatel> because pngs are pictures?  HEYOOO
[09:23:46] <decx> rekt
[09:23:50] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[09:23:51] <duch_kazatel> ++
[09:24:03] <decx> i use a cloud pattern for that
[09:25:39] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/vogafaze/1/edit?html,css,output is essentially what Iw as thinking.
[09:25:52] <BillCriswell> Just with a much better png.
[09:28:01] <decx> i can actually hear it
[09:28:13] <BillCriswell> It's saying "shhhshhehshehshhhsehshshsh
[09:28:34] <duch_kazatel> keepin' it vanilla
[09:28:46] <duch_kazatel> ninja rap time
[09:31:21] <BillCriswell> That picture cracks me up.
[09:31:29] <BillCriswell> That was cool at one point.
[09:31:38] <BillCriswell> How did we allow that to happen?
[09:31:57] <duch_kazatel> nonono - the question is "how did we allow that falling out of style to happen?"
[09:32:24] <duch_kazatel> everything about that dude is hilarious.  he has his own lighting brand now, iirc.
[09:34:25] <decx> that hairstyle has actually come back
[09:34:27] <aleray> Hi, any idea why I can't manage to set properly the baground-size and background-image css values? http://jsfiddle.net/sffs5/
[09:37:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Good point.
[09:37:48] <BillCriswell> I think it's the clothes.
[09:38:22] <BillCriswell> aleray: I'd expect that to work. No dice?
[09:39:38] <aleray> BillCriswell, i I run it it as no effect
[09:39:45] <aleray> BillCriswell, what is weird is...
[09:39:57] <decx> your bgsize is invalid
[09:40:07] <aleray> backgroundImage is set but with wrong value
[09:40:25] <aleray> the 'to bottom' chunk isn't there in the inspector (on chromium)
[09:40:45] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/sffs5/1/
[09:41:31] <decx> you joined bgsize 4 times, but after 2 it expects the comma
[09:41:44] <aleray> decx, right
[09:41:46] <aleray> thanks
[09:41:58] <BillCriswell> Missed that.
[09:46:36] <aleray> decx, BillCriswell it works now. thanks.

[10:37:44] <Leo2013> okay .. i will give me 5 minutes
[10:38:40] <Leo2013> but i can send you the link pm too if you want
[10:38:57] <duch_kazatel> no thanks ;)
[10:39:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm in a meeting, so i may or may not be quick to respond anyway
[10:40:56] <Leo2013> okay thank you
[10:41:31] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: If you have time, you were helping me yesterday with this snippet: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/10486981 I am also trying to hide a div if the VALUE of the radio button is false. Can I include this in this snippet or should it go in a separate location?
[10:42:14] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC fiddle it?
[10:42:28] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: sure
[10:45:50] <afafaf> can someone help me out with this? I've been trying to figure out why the jquery plugin method is undefined the first time the script is run but works when its run again the second time and so forth
[10:45:53] <afafaf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23018830/jquery-plugin-methods-undefined-the-first-time-it-loads-but-not-after
[10:46:21] <duch_kazatel> can you fiddle it please, afafaf?
[10:46:55] <afafaf> okay but you can basically copy paste that in the console to test it
[10:47:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm lazy ;)
[10:48:44] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/kM6F4/ it works there, but doesn't work in my console
[10:49:10] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: basically I'm building a bookmarklet, it needs to run on the current page (which I test by going into incognito mode, copying and pasting the code in consle)
[10:51:58] <duch_kazatel> afafaf i'll bet the issue lies completely with your import and wait functions.  any reason you can't just add jquery first and do everything inside of a document ready?
[10:52:18] <duch_kazatel> or window load, whichever floats your boat.
[10:53:08] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: you mean don't use the importJS function I have there, and instead append the script tag to header using jquery?
[10:53:30] <afafaf> i wonder why the function is failing, it seems to load jquery fine
[10:53:48] <duch_kazatel> right, but the callback isn't working the way you intend.
[10:53:50] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet.
[10:54:07] <duch_kazatel> just inject jquery, namespace it, then wrap everything else in a document ready.
[10:54:07] <Leo2013> no problem in fiddle :( .. it works there but not on the site
[10:54:10] <duch_kazatel> that's how i'd do it.
[10:55:12] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 any other libraries or frameworks at play?  any console errors?  etc.
[10:55:54] <Leo2013> my site is php - and it loads footer, header and content seperated - could this be the problem !?
[10:56:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:56:04] <Leo2013> no error
[10:56:08] <duch_kazatel> the backend doesn;'t matter, the frontent rendering does.
[10:56:15] <duch_kazatel> *frontend
[10:56:57] <Leo2013> okay .. no anything is right like on fiffle i copy the code - and on the site i get no error it only dont work
[10:57:28] <duch_kazatel> can you share the fiddle?
[10:57:50] <Leo2013> true
[10:58:22] <Leo2013> http://jsfiddle.net/2uP4S/
[10:58:49] <duch_kazatel> and your html is valid?
[10:59:50] <duch_kazatel> btw - $(function() { and $(document).ready(function(){ are equivalent.  use one or the other.
[10:59:53] <duch_kazatel> and wrap everything together.
[11:01:03] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: damn I just tried appending to body tag
[11:01:17] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: still getting undefined, this is so frustrating!!! argggh
[11:01:33] <duch_kazatel> and ditched your custom methods?
[11:01:37] <duch_kazatel> and used getscript instead?
[11:01:58] <Leo2013> i try ...
[11:02:01] <afafaf> let me update the fiddle
[11:04:24] <Leo2013> i wrap it together - but dont works too
[11:04:43] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 try validating in the w3 validator.
[11:09:29] <CrowX-> how can I style the scroll created by "overflow: scroll"
[11:10:40] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/7725687/923919
[11:10:47] <duch_kazatel> in short - write your own "scroll"
[11:12:10] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: I'm using getScript() I am getting success but the data is coming back as null
[11:13:00] <afafaf> duch_kazatel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23018830/jquery-plugin-methods-undefined-the-first-time-it-loads-but-not-after
[11:13:07] <afafaf> I updated what I'm doing with getScript()
[11:14:47] <afafaf> and it seems like getScript gets blocked due to single origin policy
[11:16:15] <duch_kazatel> you have to put your other code in the success callback of your getscripts.
[11:16:24] <duch_kazatel> you're basically looking to do a series of callbacks.
[11:17:23] <Leo2013> 110 Errors, 22 warning(s) .. damn - but there is nothing with jquery
[11:17:40] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 some of those can cause issues with it though.
[11:17:53] <Leo2013> there is no attribute "ALT" thats the most
[11:18:11] <duch_kazatel> any issues with html, body, head, etc. tags?
[11:20:38] <Leo2013> nope
[11:21:05] <duch_kazatel> weird
[11:21:25] <duch_kazatel> feel free to toss a link out to the channel, but who knows at this point.
[11:21:56] <freeone3000> obj.modal() is giving me the error message "Object [object Object] has no method modal" with JQuery UI 1.10.4 and jquery 1.10.2. JQuery UI was a "custom" build with everything checked. https://gist.github.com/freeone3000/aff9801abb45fb8e5940 is the exact js block and the code I'm running. What's wrong?

[11:34:00] <apipkin> I'm wanting to create a widget that uses/overwrites a node on the page (progressive enhancement like). Where would I need to look to get started on that?
[11:34:19] <duch_kazatel> widget or plugin?
[11:34:53] <duch_kazatel> because this is where you should start with plugin development: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[11:36:11] <freeone3000> What is wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/pKmT9/ ? Why doesn't it show my dialog?
[11:36:15] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure I understand what the difference is. Basically I'm wanting to have a  node on the page with content, parse it for content to store internally, then replace that node with the new component that's generated
[11:36:42] <freeone3000> Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/pKmT9/1/ . Still not showing the dialog.
[11:36:42] <apipkin> freeone3000: I believe you need jquery UI on there for that?
[11:36:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha
[11:36:52] <freeone3000> apipkin: Yeah, just fixed that, no change. Weird.
[11:37:14] <BillCriswell> I have a wedding to to go so I get to leave in a bit.
[11:37:22] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell lucky.
[11:38:33] <BillCriswell> Aw yeah.
[11:50:48] <freeone3000> apipkin: Any clues on the updated jsfiddle? Should that code be working? Does it work for you? Does the Google CDN versio of jquery ui miss stuff that a local custom version might not?
[11:52:21] <apipkin> freeone3000: shouldn't it be dialog?
[11:53:03] <BillCriswell> Oooooo
[11:53:55] <BillCriswell> The man has a point.
[11:54:01] <BillCriswell> Think I should be back in bed.
[11:54:08] <TheEternalAbyss> i had a question regarding .slideDown and .slideUp. I think I may need clarification on a few things about it. I have a div inside my body, which should slide down on load of the page if a user has a certain browser. I have the height set for it and all. I'm calling slideDown on $(document).ready
[11:54:25] <TheEternalAbyss> I don't see it...sliding
[11:55:03] <TheEternalAbyss> so I'm a wee bit confused.. the div is already displayed on load so maybe i'm doing something wrong
[12:04:23] <freeone3000> apipkin: Ah. Yep, looks like it's not a jquery ui dialog at all. Looks like it's bootstrap2. Somehow. Thanks.
[12:27:30] <ModusPwnens> Is there a reliable way to capture all click events on a page?
[12:27:37] <duch_kazatel> ish.
[12:27:42] <duch_kazatel> why do you think you need that?
[12:27:58] <ModusPwnens> I want to do logging of user clicks on the page
[12:28:17] <ModusPwnens> I know I can just setup logging for specific elements of my choosing
[12:28:39] <ModusPwnens> but if possible, it might be nice to just log everything. That way I might be able to find out if users are clicking things that I wouldn't expect them to click
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> you could do either $('*').on('click', function(){}); or $(document).on('click', '*', function(){);
[12:29:20] <ModusPwnens> What happens if there is an event handler that stops propogation?
[12:29:22] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('click', '*', function(){});
[12:29:26] <duch_kazatel> you're hosed ;)
[12:29:37] <duch_kazatel> that's why i first asked why you thought you needed that.
[12:30:37] <ModusPwnens> I wonder if i can consider that a reliable way if it's possible to stop the event from bubbling up like that
[12:30:55] <ModusPwnens> but maybe it would be enough to just ensure nobody stops event propogation in our code
[12:31:17] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea imo.
[12:31:29] <duch_kazatel> and unrealistic, since you'll need to do that sometimes.
[12:31:42] <duch_kazatel> why are you logging clicks like that?
[12:51:36] <ankurk_> Can't wait to call it a day.
[12:52:02] <duch_kazatel> can't wait until lunch imo.
[12:53:45] <ankurk_> lunch is always boring for me
[12:54:14] <duch_kazatel> we're getting free lunch with beer probably.
[12:54:38] <ankurk_> free lunch :O
[12:54:49] <hlfw0rd> free lunch ftw
[12:54:57] <hlfw0rd> I got free thai sushi today XD
[12:55:04] <ankurk_> I wish I get a job at a place where I would get free lunch :D
[12:55:13] <hlfw0rd> corporations ftw
[12:55:44] <ankurk_> Not every corporation actually
[12:56:19] <duch_kazatel> and not just corporations.
[12:57:16] <ankurk_> most of the startups provide free lunches too
[12:57:30] <ankurk_> I would actually love to work in one
[12:58:17] <duch_kazatel> i worked at one for a while.
[12:59:40] <ankurk_> how was the experience?
[13:05:03] <CrowX-> when I use $(event.target).next(), and event.target doesn't have an ID, and has multiple classes. How do I know which classes' 'next()' element will be returned?
[13:11:35] <Hyperking> im using media elementjs and keep getting an error with the css file?? Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[13:15:00] <CrowX-> Hyperking, you've most likely forgotten to close a brace or quote, or you shouldn't use . in the line the error is reported at
[13:16:45] <logikos> i have a function and sometimes an object is passed to it and sometimes a serializeArray is passed to it, if its a normal object i want to add a property to it, if its a serializeArray i want to push some {name:'blah',value:'val'} to it
[13:16:54] <logikos> but how can i know what it was that was passed
[13:17:00] <logikos> typeof for both is just 'object'
[13:17:23] <NoiseEee> CrowX-: you're asking 'how do i know what classes are on the element returned by next()'  ?
[13:17:37] <duch_kazatel> logikos what sort of browser support do you need?
[13:18:19] <CrowX-> NoiseEee, I already got the answer of that one, and it wasn't my problem. The problem is the following:
[13:18:22] <logikos> for this specific case firefox, although i'd hope for IE9+,firefox,chrome
[13:18:39] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn isArray()
[13:18:41] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Array.isArray() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray
[13:18:44] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[13:18:52] <logikos> ty
[13:19:48] <CrowX-> I have a few elements of class 'example' inside a <div>, and I can iterate through them by using $('.example').next(). However, one element of ('.example') is in another div. Is there a way I could access it with .next()?
[13:20:13] <logikos> thats perfect
[13:30:36] <har0ld> yo
[13:31:57] <har0ld> hola
[13:57:01] <ellipsis753> Hello. I'm looking for a little tutorial on the basics of jQuery for a job I'm starting soon. It found something at learn.jquery.com but I wondered if there's something I could ideally print off and read. Is it OK for me to ask here for a recommendation? I've done some javascript before but no jQuery.
[13:59:26] <NoiseEee> ellipsis753: really the best way is by reading with a laptop in front of you etc, something to actually do stuff in console etc
[14:09:02] <ellipsis753> NoiseEee, Ok. Thank you. I do like reading through stuff offline when I can though. Would you think learn.jquery.com is the best place to start? Sadly it looked very unsuited to printing but I could still read it.
[14:15:16] <robert0> ellipsis753 We're all going to suggest learn. - using that along with something like jsfiddle is stellar because you can learn by running examples and whatnot.
[14:16:01] <ellipsis753> That's great thank you. And it's good that you think that the official documentation and tutorials are best. :) Ok. I'll start reading.
[14:48:46] <Thoams> 'lo
[14:55:03] <duch_kazatel> Goood afternoon
[15:31:59] <duch_workbeer> oh god somebody brought in plum wine my day is ove.
[15:32:00] <duch_workbeer> *over
[16:26:01] <ankurk_> duch_workbeer is having the best friday ever :D
[16:26:55] <duch_kazatel> well duch
[16:26:58] <duch_kazatel> *duh
[16:27:13] <duch_kazatel> my wife is out of town this weekend, too, so I get to do all the shit i want.
[17:26:24] <cluelesscoder> hi, could someone help me figure out how to capture information in a dynamically created textarea so that I can grab it and submit it to a database? I have a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cluelesscoder/3NcGB/9/ but I can't even get my alert to fire
[17:29:23] <jphaser> cluelesscoder: you don't have a form with id="test" on this page
[17:29:44] <cluelesscoder> I create one dynamically...
[17:29:56] <jphaser> you create a form
[17:30:01] <jphaser> not with id="test"
[17:30:03] <cluelesscoder> well, at least I create an input with id test
[17:30:11] <cluelesscoder> does it matter whether the id is in the form or a child element?
[17:30:18] <jphaser> inputs don't have a submit event that I know of
[17:30:33] <cluelesscoder> hmm, well I originally had it as click
[17:30:42] <jphase> so there's a few things here...
[17:30:46] <cluelesscoder> moved the id to the form, didn't change anything...
[17:31:08] <jphase> if you want to bind to your events to dynamically created elements, you'll want to bind to the document with the child as the second param, or bind it to the element as you create it
[17:31:22] <jphase> it won't fire because it doesn't exist yet, so instead you do something like...
[17:31:29] <cluelesscoder> ah yeah...
[17:31:42] <jphase> $(document).on('submit', '#test', function(){ // your stuff });
[17:32:23] <cluelesscoder> good point
[17:32:29] <cluelesscoder> I knew that but forgot it
[17:32:58] <cluelesscoder> so my second issue, and the reason I created the jsfiddle (a mangled copy of something in a project), is that I'm not able to capture the updated textarea text
[17:33:33] <cluelesscoder> so when I do what you suggested and then edit the textarea, it doesn't reflect added content
[17:34:52] <cluelesscoder> I imagine there's a standard way to grab that content...
[17:36:10] <cluelesscoder> any ideas jphase?
[17:36:58] <jphase> one sec sorry
[17:37:53] <jphase> cluelesscoder: send me an updated fiddle
[17:38:19] <cluelesscoder> See http://jsfiddle.net/cluelesscoder/3NcGB/16/ - if you click edit fields and then edit the field and click submit, it doesn't reflect the edit
[17:39:49] <jphase> cluelesscoder: so you should rewrite this for a couple of reasons, let me eat a couple raviolis and I'll do a collab mode with you
[17:39:59] <cluelesscoder> ok
[17:42:48] <cluelesscoder> I think maybe change would work but I wasn't setting it on an existing element... lemme see
[17:44:55] <jphase> cluelesscoder: http://jsfiddle.net/cluelesscoder/3NcGB/9/#&togetherjs=0qdigajgad
[17:50:13] <fels_zh> hi all - anyone use jasmine - need some help  - I wrote basic one but its not running or not even failing .. seems like its not being callled at all
[18:15:51] <jphase> cluelesscoder: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/3NcGB/18/
[18:15:56] <jphase> that's from our thingy
[18:16:30] <cluelesscoder> ok cool. yeah it wasn't really letting me save it
[18:16:54] <jphase> collab mode is a bit buggy :\
[18:17:46] <cluelesscoder> yeah well can't complain too much about free programs...
[18:18:03] <jphase> touché - especially when they're advertised as beta ;)
[18:21:19] <cluelesscoder> and I'm out. thanks again jphase. ended a couple hours of frustration!
[20:06:29] <kkzrs> Hello, I need help with something that I've been researching for a while. Can't figure what to do therefore I'm willing to exchange money for beer over paypal for help. I need to change the contents of each child div of container div. I have the contents but what I can't figure out is what should I do in order to pull the contents in the parent child divs when a link has been clicked.
[20:09:19] <kkzrs> I understand that it should use variables in the tags to get the data from json but I have no clue on how to change them accordingly to what the div id is.
[20:13:02] <kkzrs> Really no one wants free beer here? :/
[20:29:21] <kkzrs> Pretty much what I'm having biggest trouble figuring out is how to put json!? is there anyone who could help me?
[20:30:59] <jphase> kkzrs: eh? json? beer? you have my attention
[20:43:50] <fattest> my popover is behind the timeline events, i'm not sure whether this is a jquery problem or css, i did set the z-index. http://jsfiddle.net/3qvcq/6
[20:46:57] <Max-P> fattest, CSS. Everything that's related to the style of an element is a CSS problem. All jQuery does is manipulate the CSS of a node or the nodes
[20:47:27] <fattest> Max-P: thank you very much
[20:47:57] <Max-P> fattest, it's the z-index, but I'm trying to figure out why it doesn't work
[20:49:01] <fattest> Max-P: i've been working on it for ages....i can't seem to make it bring to front either
[20:51:29] <Max-P> fattest, The last one visible seems to be working properly
[20:51:49] <Max-P> If the popover div relative to the timeline item thing?
[20:51:58] <Max-P> is*
[20:52:09] <fattest> i think so
[20:52:36] <Max-P> Because absolute applies related to its relative
[20:53:08] <Max-P> An entire relative div will always be over another relative div no matter the z-index of the childs
[20:53:21] <fattest> so how should i fix this?
[20:54:05] <Max-P> Raise the z-index of the timeline item on mouse over (say, 2), and lower it back to lower (say, 1) on mouse out
[20:54:51] <Max-P> That way the row that can create popovers will have a higher z-index, and the absolutely positioned div will thus be on the front
[20:55:20] <Max-P> Or make your popover relative to the entire page instead of to the row
[20:55:36] <fattest> ok
[20:55:38] <fattest> allow me to try this
[20:56:31] <fattest> Max-P: .timeline-list-container-wrapper { right?
[20:56:45] <fattest> i should make a z index of 2?
[20:57:24] <Max-P> fattest, timeline-item-container
[20:58:11] <Max-P> It is relative, but there's another relative container inside it
[20:58:29] <fattest> yes
[21:00:44] <fattest> Max-P: http://jsfiddle.net/3qvcq/8/ still no difference
[21:06:06] <Max-P> fattest, http://waku.max-p.fr.nf/temp5/irc-zIndex.png Your problem looks like this
[21:07:28] <fattest> i see'
[21:07:56] <fattest> the top is for popover and bottom is for timeline right?
[21:08:14] <Max-P> An absolutely positionned element is contained in its parent relative. Right now, your .timeline-item-container are relative and ordered  each child over the previous child
[21:09:14] <Max-P> Any absolutely positioned anything inside a .timeline-item-container will always be at the same level
[21:10:15] <fattest> Max-P: should i change the position?
[21:11:15] <Max-P> fattest, Due to your design you don't really can (I just removed every position: style and nothing is at the right place)
[21:11:54] <Max-P> But what you can do, is makre sure the entire .timeline-item-container is over the others
[21:12:52] <Max-P> So you have something like this: [container z-index: 1] [container z-index: 2] [container z-index: 1] [container z-index: 1]
[21:13:14] <Max-P> In that case, the popover of the second node will be over the others, because the containing node is over the others
[21:13:32] <fattest> ok allow me to try this
[21:15:24] <Max-P> I'll draw something, I'm bad at explaining this
[21:16:39] <fattest> Max-P: ".timeline-list-container-wrapper .timeline-list-container .timeline-item-container {" will have z index of 2, and every other element with timeline-item-container will have z-index of 1?
[21:25:03] <Max-P> fattest, No. only the one that is selected. You want that: http://waku.max-p.fr.nf/temp5/irc-z-2.png
[21:26:21] <Max-P> The second one is over all five others because that's the one I have the mouse over, and thus the popover contained *inside* the second element is over all five bars as well.
[21:26:58] <fattest> ohh
[21:26:58] <Max-P> If I point the third one, then only the third one should have z-index: 2
[21:27:47] <Max-P> Or you can give them decreasing z-index so the first is always over the second one, like this: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
[21:28:45] <fattest> Max-P: i'll try updating my jsfiddle...
[21:33:50] <cool_boy> I am trying to implement jquery-slider with help of http://www.jssor.com/development/index.html my code is http://pastebin.com/duRqfR3W. all I can see is just the image red (whichever is written first).
[21:34:30] <cool_boy> images are not changing on page. all images and js files are in same directory as index.html
[21:35:05] <cool_boy> could anyone help me out?
[21:40:39] <cool_boy> I guess my messages are being posted on channel? can someone confirm if I am audible here??
[21:44:11] <Max-P> cool_boy, Yes, I can read you
[21:44:25] <cool_boy> Max-P: thanks for confirm :)
[21:47:26] <Max-P> cool_boy, That's not enough to help you. Everything is in the Jssor scripts, or it is a CSS issue of yours
[21:48:08] <cool_boy> Max-P: I think its .css issue, I have not created css file
[21:49:19] <cool_boy> Max-P: but document doesnt say need to create .css to see slider working, images should appear in any size, i guess
[21:50:20] <cool_boy> Max-P: styles are in <div> tag
[21:51:34] <Max-P> cool_boy, If the purple is in front of the blue in front of the red, then that's because somehow the script doesn't update the z-index of the elements
[21:51:56] <Max-P> err
[21:52:03] <Max-P> no that's the other issue, derp
[21:52:45] <Max-P> There must be an error in the script
[21:53:02] <Max-P> does the console show any error? Can you post a live example (like on jsfiddle)
[21:58:37] <fattest> Max-P: i still can't get it to work....can you please help
[22:00:19] <fattest> ...on the fiddle
[22:02:36] <cool_boy> Max-P: no it doesn't show error , i will try to put on jsfiddle
[22:05:20] <cool_boy> Max-P: how can I add images and extra .js files on jsfiddle?
[22:09:59] <cool_boy> Max-P: thanks, got it working there was .js error I  copied "jssor.slider.min.js" instead "jssor.slider.js"
[22:30:22] <basiclaser_> hey guys is there a library for simulating tearing off bits of paper like on a flyer?
