[05:57:30] <errorous> Hello. I'm using jquery and datatables. The problem that I'm having is that I want to display only 4 columns, but be able to export to xlsx all the columns plus more columns I have in data object that I get via ajax call
[05:58:03] <errorous> now, the only way I can do this, is to either customize export functionality for xlsx button, or show data in table, and then hide it
[05:58:44] <errorous> since I don't really know much about datatables export functionality, I want to go with latter option: create columns on ajax response.
[05:59:18] <errorous> now, I come to a problem that the number of columns is not fixed, but depends on what user picks before ajax call is made
[05:59:44] <errorous> which makes me need to dynamically manipulate <th> in my table, so that datatables won't break
[06:00:18] <errorous> because the number of columns needs to match number of <th> tags in table
[06:00:36] <errorous> this being said, I will either need to add or remove <th> tags
[06:00:58] <errorous> so, my next problem, is removing dynamically added <th>s
[06:01:08] <errorous> Any ideas of what's my best option here?
[06:22:25] <aruns> Hi, I have this jQuery snippet to allow full playback of a video on a Bootstrap carousel slide before it slides - https://bpaste.net/5ROA - it was working before I moved it into a nested function call.
[06:22:48] <aruns> My question is how does event propagation / bubbling work in regard to nested function calls within an event handler?
[06:23:22] <aruns> Do nested function calls have no effect on the return value of the event handler?
[06:32:54] <Cork> aruns: it isn't even bubbling
[06:33:20] <Cork> aruns: you bind an event handler on line 28 and in it call an object method allowFullPlayback
[06:33:23] <Cork> that's it
[06:33:29] <kirua_> hi
[06:33:53] <Cork> and this most likely doesn't work for you cause your not returning the retur value from allowFullPlayback in line 29
[06:34:46] <Cork> aruns: i would prob try to use event.prevetDefalt() instead of return false;
[06:35:05] <Cork> not sure if that works for bootstrap fake events though
[06:35:09] <kirua_> i want, when clicking on a button, copy to clipboard content off all rows of table with a certain id, why this doesnt work : https://pastebin.com/1VfRNfMD ?
[06:36:17] <Cork> kirua_: you hide the #t1 on line 4 and try to select it on line 5
[06:38:00] <kirua_> cork, if it's hidden, it can't be selected ? i updated but it makes no difference
[06:38:26] <Cork> kirua_: it makes a difference, you can't select what isn't there
[06:38:42] <Cork> and except for that donno, it's dead code
[06:39:01] <kirua_> donno?
[06:39:13] <Cork> the code is without context
[06:42:06] <kirua_> i get this error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'select' of null
[06:42:59] <Cork> ya so the dom structor doesn't match your selector
[06:43:13] <Cork> and as you're working with ids don't do the $().siblings()
[06:43:22] <Cork> just do $('#t1').select()
[06:43:36] <Cork> (ids has to be page unique anyway)
[06:46:19] <kirua_> still getting the same error :Cannot read property 'select' of null
[06:47:12] <Cork> wait select on null... is $ jquery?
[06:48:08] <kirua_> what do you mean?
[06:48:12] <kirua_> i'm using jquery
[06:48:23] <Cork> jquery never returns null values
[06:48:30] <Cork> so you shouldn't get that error
[07:07:03] <kirua_> Uncaught ReferenceError: jquery is not defined
[07:07:08] <kirua_> how come ?
[07:58:28] <errorous> any expert in jquery here willing to help out with some code, for a one-off contract?
[07:58:50] <errorous> datatables jquery
[08:14:21] <Northwoods> https://jsfiddle.net/w3xzpkfm/     <----------   How can i make the code to wait for result of call before going to next each iteration.
[08:16:05] <Cork> use a recursive function
[08:16:17] <Cork> and call it in the done callback for the next iteration
[08:16:56] <Northwoods> Calling same function in done callback ?
[08:17:44] <Cork> function next(index) { $.ajax().always(function() { next(++index); }); } next(0)
[08:18:11] <Cork> you need an if case to stop when the index reach the end fo the array your looping
[12:02:10] <asdfgh> hello
[12:02:17] <asdfgh> i have a very simple plugin https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1295468
[12:02:47] <asdfgh> i wonder how i can put inside the plugin a method that will be called when there is a click on .remove-button
[12:48:04] <Cork> asdfgh: $(elm).on('click.dynamicForm', function() { /* do stuff */ });
[12:48:35] <Cork> and if you want to remove it specifically $(elm).off('.dynamicForm')
[12:48:38] <asdfgh> Cork, wait
[12:48:48] <asdfgh> i apply my plugin to a #container
[12:48:54] <asdfgh> then inside this container i .append() element
[12:49:01] <asdfgh> i sometime append .remove-button
[12:49:11] <asdfgh> so basically i have to listen click event on them
[12:49:16] <asdfgh> i do not need to use custom event
[12:49:21] <asdfgh> just get the click event when happen
[12:49:23] <asdfgh> understand?
[12:49:54] <Cork> var elm = $('<button>', { class: this.removeClass }); container.append(elm); elm.on('click.dynamicForm', function() {});
[12:50:18] <Cork> don't append html, append dom elements
[12:51:12] <Cork> also click.<something> isn't custom event handlers it is namespaces
[12:51:38] <Cork> it is so you later can remove just your specifc handlers without also removeing all other click handler third parties might have added
[12:52:44] <Cork> asdfgh: also there is a third option that _might_ work for you
[12:53:09] <Cork> and that is container.on('click.dynamicForm', this.removeClass, function() {})
[12:53:26] <Cork> that catches bubbling events from the remove button class inside the container
[12:53:37] <Cork> and will work nomatter when it is added to the container
[12:53:52] <Cork> so you don't need to dynamically bind the handler
[12:54:05] <Cork> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:56:27] <asdfgh> Cork, the last approach seems quite easy...however should i write $(this).on
[12:56:33] <asdfgh> intead of container right ?
[12:56:43] <asdfgh> $(this) refer to the entire object so it should work right?
[12:56:49] <Cork> asdfgh: it should be on the outer most element
[12:57:04] <Cork> so it depends on how your selector structure are
[12:57:09] <asdfgh> ok
[12:57:25] <Cork> cause it doesn't catch events for all elements you create
[12:57:29] <Cork> it bubbles up the dom tree
[12:58:49] <asdfgh> Cork, https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1295469
[12:58:56] <asdfgh> this work i mean...i can see the alert()
[12:59:24] <asdfgh> unfortunately i need to inject html because those are templates.. so there are div span etc...it is basically an html block that i have to repeat
[12:59:41] <asdfgh> so i thought to pass those template code in "templates" settings
[13:00:02] <Cork> asdfgh: your plugin has one basic quite big problem
[13:00:07] <Cork> it can only handle one form
[13:00:22] <Cork> if you do $('form') and have more then one in the page your plugin will break
[13:00:32] <Cork> and it is very easy to fix that
[13:00:32] <asdfgh> Cork, this is how i declare it: https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1295470 i know it is a really stupid example but just to make sense to you
[13:00:44] <Cork> just wrap your plugin code in this.each(function() {})
[13:00:47] <asdfgh> oh really?
[13:01:05] <asdfgh> $('#container').dynamicForm({...}) $('#other_container').dynamicForm({...})
[13:01:08] <asdfgh> will break?
[13:01:26] <Cork> no, but $('#container, #other_container').dynamicForm({})
[13:01:59] <Cork> your plugin currently can only handle one matched element per invocation
[13:02:31] <asdfgh> oh yeah! you are right! how can i fix it?
[13:02:46] <Cork> you will have to change your plugins structure quite a bit
[13:03:09] <Cork> but fundamentally you do this.each(function() { /* all your plugin code goes here */ })
[13:03:36] <Cork> but it also means you can't monky patch in extra functions in the returned jquery object
[13:06:05] <Cork> asdfgh: you migth want to have a look at https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js
[13:06:10] <Cork> anyway i have to run
[13:06:38] <asdfgh> ok thank you cork!
[14:47:59] <ExeciN> hi people. I'm trying to prepend the href attribute of some a elements but I can't figure out how. $('a[href^="#q-"]').attr('href', '/index.php?route=mpfaq/faq' + $(this).attr('href'));
[14:48:04] <ExeciN> what am I doing wrong?
[14:51:21] <shoky_> ExeciN: `this` is probably not what you think it is there.  you probably want  .attr('href', (i, attr) => '/index.php?...' + attr)
[14:54:23] <ExeciN> oh I see
[14:54:41] <ExeciN> so I could use a function to set the attribute
[14:55:54] <ExeciN> I mean a function as the second argument of .attr()
[15:03:13] <shoky_> yes. alternatively you'd need to use .each()  to loop over the <a>'s manually
[15:28:01] <joobz> hey guys.. I'm trying to run .remove() on a particular li#, however the li# is dynamically added to the DOM and as such JQuery's .remove() is not picking it up. I'm reading about people using .on() as a delegate to achieve this, binding it to a button - but in my case I want to trigger the remove based on a socket event I receive, so there is no button press to bind an .on() to. Any ideas how this can be achieved?
[15:32:48] <joobz> all good sorted :P
[15:32:49] <joobz> thanks
[18:27:40] <kirua_> hi
[18:28:11] <kirua_> when i execute in the command : jQuery('#t2').select();
[18:28:11] <kirua_> document.execCommand("copy");  i get "false" what does it mean ?
