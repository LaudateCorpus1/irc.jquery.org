[12:24:05] <hhee> guys. at first i tried do it with pure js. but now im trying do it with jquery. how can i select class and its value in current div (where onclick)? (another div can contains class with same names but i need only current)
[12:56:42] <pavonia> hhee: Not sure I understand the question correctly, but you can use $(this) to get the clicked element in the event handler
[13:01:53] <hhee> pavonia, thx for the answer. i'll try. i have list classes with form in each (simple cart system) in each class i need to find values of id to send it using ajax when onclick event
[13:03:09] <hhee> list of div with classes*
[15:03:34] <hhee> one more question. how can i select current form. where onclick event will be perform? now i works as - var1 = jQuery("#item1 input[name=quantity]").val();,var2=jQuery("#item1 input[name=productid]").val()  -- BUT i need current form id
[15:03:54] <hhee> now it's hardcoded by hand

[17:40:49] <JamesPeach> I'm encountering a weird problem. I'm adding a mousedown even listener to check the class of a clicked element (i.e. classList.contains("myclass")). Problem is when I click the element first it gives the wrong div, but on second click it's the correct div?! This div element is like a modal so it shows above another div
[23:08:50] <jak2000> anyone know about meteor?
