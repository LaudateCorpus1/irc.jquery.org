[00:15:33] <hooligan321> yeah there is jqmobile / twitter conflict
[00:15:36] <hooligan321> wtf
[00:21:57] * hooligan321 takes refuge with a jquery tap plugin
[00:42:28] <hooligan321> http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/Tap_vs_swipe.html <-- a sweet little plugin
[00:42:31] <hooligan321> 11kb
[00:42:41] <hooligan321> jqM = 193kb
[00:45:05] <hooligan321> no doubt if you snip jqm's tap handling out there would be no contest in terms of which ones more efficient/light weight just sayin ;)
[03:36:23] <piyushparkash> I want to run a function on every matched element. Is this correct $("select", function () {})

[04:00:56] <basiclaser> hey guys, how can i use feature detection to only apply certain css when page is opened in chrome?
[04:01:19] <basiclaser> I built a site that has bugs only in chrome, and i just need to pick up on the browser

[05:55:42] <argoneus> Hello
[05:55:48] <argoneus> Anyone here? ;<
[06:48:34] <joshft91> Hey guys - I'm new to jQuery and I have this that used to work: $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content');
[06:49:05] <joshft91> However, it's returning undefined now. If I do $('meta') I get a list of <meta> tags but for some reason I can't get the one with the itemProp=contentUrl
[06:49:06] <joshft91> Any thoughts?
[06:53:39] <joshft91> Hey guys - I'm new to jQuery and I have this that used to work: $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content'); However, it's returning undefined now. If I do $('meta') I get a list of <meta> tags but for some reason I can't get the one with the itemProp=contentUrl. Any thoughts?
[07:00:55] <joshft91> Hey guys - I'm new to jQuery and I have this that used to work: $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content'); However, it's returning undefined now. If I do $('meta') I get a list of <meta> tags but for some reason I can't get the one with the itemProp=contentUrl. Any thoughts?
[07:02:00] <joshft91> I'm inspecting the element and if I do this $('meta')[18] I get the element but if I append .attr('content') to it, it says it's undefined even though i can see it through the element inspector
[07:02:20] <Jattenalle> try .prop() instead of .attr()
[07:02:25] <Jattenalle> or .val()
[07:02:58] <decx> the hell is contentURL anyway
[07:03:17] <Jattenalle> i find it best to never ask about random variables in peoples code, and just assume it's "proper" :P
[07:03:25] <Jattenalle> asking just unleashes the horror!
[07:03:34] <joshft91> It's an attribute on an element, lol
[07:03:43] <decx> ah, itemprop so it's some microdata
[07:03:56] <joshft91> Correct. one sec, I"ll paste it
[07:04:04] <joshft91> It's not my code fyi ;)
[07:04:19] <decx> like rel="canonical" without the support maybe ^^
[07:05:37] <joshft91> Alright, the element looks like this: <meta itemprop="contentURL" content="some url here which I want to get">
[07:05:59] <Jattenalle> yeah try .prop('content')
[07:06:02] <decx> is it a video
[07:06:11] <Jattenalle> but not sure how meta elements work
[07:06:29] <joshft91> It is a video...but that shouldn't matter?  $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content'); <-- that used to work just fine, I'm baffled why it stopped
[07:06:31] <decx> prop or attr doesnt really matter for getting
[07:06:54] <Jattenalle> yes it does decx, pretty sure attr is deprecated for most things
[07:07:03] <Jattenalle> or am i remembering the docs wrong? :/
[07:07:35] <joshft91> well wtf, 'prop' just worked now...but 'attr' used to work. Am I high?
[07:08:02] <joshft91> 'attr' is deprecated?
[07:08:02] <decx> there's about a billion sites with legacy code from when attr was used like prop, i doubt they would deprecate it that swiftly ^^
[07:08:15] <decx> works find in 202 here
[07:08:20] <Jattenalle> well, apparently they did ;)
[07:08:23] <decx> and 210
[07:08:30] <joshft91> Could my version of jQuery be the issue? running 2.1.1 I believe
[07:08:33] <Jattenalle> i know .attr didnt work for me on some elements, but prop worked
[07:08:34] <decx> and 110
[07:08:41] <decx> fine*
[07:08:44] <joshft91> wonder if some old jQuery was getting injected before which is why '.attr' would work?
[07:08:53] <Jattenalle> and docs say .attr is dead
[07:09:08] <decx> it still works on both edges
[07:09:19] * Jattenalle shrugs
[07:09:28] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/dpekmm5o/
[07:09:33] <Jattenalle> prop works for him, attr didnt.. which is the same that i've been seeing
[07:09:36] <decx> where did that bold come from
[07:09:38] <joshft91> huh, well today I learned. So I should switch to '.prop' from now on?
[07:09:59] <joshft91> Also, does this irc client not auto scroll or something?
[07:10:11] <decx> where do you get that attr is dead
[07:10:17] <Jattenalle> joshft91, some element things are under attr, some are under prop
[07:10:23] <Jattenalle> depends on what you want
[07:10:25] <decx> it's certainly not
[07:10:51] <decx> attr is now just for attributes, you used to be able to get properties too
[07:10:54] <Jattenalle> decx, i mean this:
[07:10:54] <Jattenalle> "As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set. To retrieve and change DOM properties such as the checked, selected, or disabled state of form elements, use the .prop() method."
[07:10:55] <Jattenalle> yeah
[07:11:06] <Jattenalle> as seen http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[07:11:13] <Jattenalle> attr used to work for properties, it no longer does
[07:11:13] <decx> well if it's in the markup it's an attribute ^^
[07:11:18] <Jattenalle> apparently not :/
[07:11:38] <decx> but i used attr on that fiddle
[07:11:45] <Jattenalle> yeah i dunno
[07:11:49] <joshft91> How can you tell if it's a property or an attribute? Seems like .attr should still work?
[07:12:25] <decx> if it's in the markup
[07:13:48] <joshft91> So should I be safe with using .prop now or...?
[07:14:01] <decx> <a href="blah"></a> has the attrbute [href]
[07:14:15] <decx> but if you log it, you see that it also has about 50 properties
[07:14:48] <joshft911> Hmm, interesting. I just find it weird that .attr worked before and now it doesn't.
[07:14:49] <decx> scrollHeight, offsetTop, host, href, download, dataset ....
[07:15:01] <joshft911> I'm nearly positive that nothing else changed
[07:15:10] <decx> it still works for what you are trying to do, i'm sure there something fucky going on
[07:15:19] <decx> there is*
[07:15:34] <joshft911> Wouldn't surprise me. Is using .prop considered not proper or anything?
[07:15:53] <decx> heheh prop er
[07:15:59] <joshft911> ehehehhe
[07:16:38] <decx> attributes are strings but properties can be anything
[07:16:50] <decx> so it's always good to go with properties
[07:17:17] <decx> i'm still looking for that time where attr is more appropriate
[07:17:36] <joshft911> Hmm, cool, good to know. I"ll just use '.prop' now instead.
[07:17:46] <joshft911> I just find it weird that .attr stopped working and it pissed me off
[07:18:24] <decx> <a data-stuff="blah"> $('a').data('stuff','notblah'), $('a').data('stuff') will now return notblah but $('a').attr('data-stuff') will still return blah
[07:18:40] <decx> that's one case
[07:19:11] <joshft911> I don't think I'm going to run into an edge case like that any time soon
[07:21:21] <joshft911> So in case .attr starts working ... something like this should be somewhat reliable (or overkill, whatever) right? var videoUrl = $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content') == undefined
[07:21:21] <joshft911>     ? $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').prop('content')
[07:21:21] <joshft911>     : $('meta[itemprop=contentURL]').attr('content');
[07:22:35] <decx> good lord
[07:22:42] <joshft911> :D
[07:22:43] <decx> i still say the problem is somewhere else
[07:23:14] <joshft911> Most likely. I"ll just stick with .prop and if it breaks I'll investigate. This code is so small it must be outside of my js files
[07:26:24] <jop008> htis is my header file how to include a downloaded css theme ?
[07:26:34] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/BUdaifet

[07:27:44] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/wfpzHdV.gif

[07:29:29] <jop008> I know css of course
[07:29:43] <jop008> but theming is different stuf

[10:07:37] <Jon31> is there a decent jquery plugin that will turn a nested ul list into a navigation menu with drop down that is  easily customizable?
[10:22:36] <decx> i never used it but i often removed superfish from projects so apparently it's popular
[10:22:56] <decx> oh bit lit. Jon31 ^^
[10:23:01] <decx> late*

[10:51:37] <jeffreylevesque> in order to send POST data using ajax to my php script, do i need to define the 'data' property?
[10:56:29] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You don't have to... but I can't think of a reason why you wouldn't want to?
[12:02:50] <Jattenalle> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUbpb23yTK8
[12:24:06] <jeffreylevesque> is the only way to return values from php to ajax is to alert(), or print() them?  is there no way to pass the data to the ajax script?
[12:24:54] <Prometheian> In PHP you should be able to return JSON data which you can capture. success: function getGoodData(data) {}
[12:25:19] <checkit> Hey guys! So I've got an intersting question. I'm building an app that pulls ranking reports from google but I need to supply a custom location in the search tools. I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to automate this. Any suggestions? (using php & jquery)
[13:06:43] <checkit> How can I use a selector to click a button when the button is as follows: <div role="button">Save</div> I need to match "Save"
[13:06:50] <checkit> There are no other unique identifiers...
[13:09:43] <checkit> Anyone? Anyone?
[13:30:43] <pvh_sa> hey there... I'm trying to understand how to pass a parameter to a Deferred()... I'm using $.when($.ajax(...)}.done(function (...) { ... }) - but I want to pass a parameter to that function... I'm thinking chained deferreds perhaps? I've tried $.when({param: value}, $.ajax(...)}.done{function(a,b){...}) but 'a' ends up undefined...
[14:34:25] <stan_man_can> Whats the best way to check and see if the browser is online?
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> boring saturday
[15:30:14] <uskerine> robertmaxrees, just in case you were curious finally I did not had to implement anything for the PDF. In a production server it takes 2 seconds to generate the PDF and send it back to the browsers. It seems that my development laptop is pretty slow
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> uskerine woah - I thought you were talking about your live server stats before.
[15:31:12] <robertmaxrees> that's much less concerning.
[15:31:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:32:14] <morenoh152> hey guys
[15:32:20] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[15:33:00] <uskerine> yeah it was a relief. for some reason I think that my two core laptop is working at 0.8Ghz
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> uskerine i'd yell at your IT folks in that case.
[15:33:59] <uskerine> I wish I would have IT folks to yell at :)
[15:34:03] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:34:13] <robertmaxrees> gotta get a core i7 at least.
[15:34:17] <uskerine> it is an old laptop I got from my last employer
[15:34:23] <robertmaxrees> actually, the i5s are great, too.
[15:34:41] <uskerine> nah I am happy with it, the only time I have seen issues has been this time with the PDF, other than that I haven't noticed anything
[15:35:01] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out, though :)
[15:52:21] <Prometheian> In C# I can type ~/blah to get to my home directory. Is there a way to do that in javascript?
[15:53:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean in like node?  ooor...
[15:54:19] <Prometheian> I have an images folder in my root dir
[15:54:24] <Prometheian> aka ~/Images
[15:54:40] <Prometheian> I was wondering how easy/hard it is to get my javascript to process the path to my home dir
[15:54:52] <robertmaxrees> are you in a web browser, oooorrr....
[15:54:58] <Prometheian> Yeah
[15:55:00] <systemfault> The home is /
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> because your js is basically agnostic to that.
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't specify anything regarding i/o or filesystems.
[15:55:41] <Prometheian> ah, wll that worked! :P
[15:56:06] <robertmaxrees> so if you do <img src="/myImage.jpg" /> in your html, that'll work.  just write in the attribute appropriately :)
[15:56:44] <robertmaxrees> just keep in mind, it's an HTML thing, not a JS thing.
[15:56:49] <Prometheian> I was bouncing data around between an ajax call, ko, and my own js method so couldn't just easily hard code it.
[15:57:10] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:57:13] <Prometheian> ^^
[16:15:28] <uskerine> does anyone know any free plugin to allow cropping images? it is for user profile photos (ID-like ones) and logos. I would like something that could do some kind of validation and basic formatting (resizing, scaling and croping)
[16:22:14] <uskerine> I will start with a simpler question
[16:22:57] <uskerine> how can it be allowed to users to upload a image which is displayed dynamically in a <img>
[16:22:59] <uskerine> ?
[17:07:26] <morenoh152> how do I replace the contents of a div with a string?
[17:07:38] <morenoh152> replaceWith replaces the node itself
[17:09:07] <morenoh152> got it .text does that
[17:16:51] <morenoh152> wait still not working
[17:24:30] <morenoh152> no wait it was messed up selector
[19:32:47] <jaccob> what is most popular for local storage
[19:34:59] <jaccob> googling for local storage I see store.js, is number 1
[19:35:27] <jaccob> then comes jstorage, realstorage, carbostorage, amplifiy..., I am going with store.js
[19:36:44] <tjwebdev77> any suggestions for a first project to learn jQuery?
[19:37:58] <jaccob> tjwebdev77, hmm, do you know how to select elements?

[20:17:22] <kij__> can someone please visit www.thewdf.org, click the top 'mission' link and quickly (but not before the scroll animation) try to use the scrollbar to scroll down and let me know if your scrollbar stutters or goes smoothly? i have some jquery doing a scroll animation that is causing stuttering on my machine
[20:20:02] <lazzle> kij__: stuttered for me :/
[20:20:23] <kij__> could you tell me what OS youre running? it happens for me too. im on 8.1 and these guys cant recreate it to try to fix it
[20:22:16] <kij__> this is the jquery for the scroll: http://pastebin.com/K2Pbfvp6
[20:22:30] <kij__> the thing is when you click the footer links youll notice theres no stutter at all
[20:27:43] <lazzle> Mavericks kij__
[20:27:49] <lazzle> in chrome
[20:28:40] <kij__> thanks. i actually got it fixed, code duplication issue
[20:28:45] <kij__> can you test now?
[23:12:25] <HowardwLo> after ajax success, how do you get the url?
[23:12:36] <HowardwLo> im trying to setup my pushState
[23:13:03] <HowardwLo> sometimes there are redirects, so i want to get the final url isntead of the url i used to get the ajax from
[23:25:48] <HowardwLo> i’m looking at the header, but i only see date, server, vary, content-type
[23:27:53] <paul_irish> feels doable
[23:30:57] <HowardwLo> i’m not finding any answers on SO or from google :(
[23:34:58] <paul_irish> HowardwLo: this.url ?
[23:43:06] <HowardwLo> paul_irish: this is the response data?
[23:43:29] <paul_irish> ya
[23:43:49] <HowardwLo> paul_irish: undefined
[23:43:57] <paul_irish> o
[23:43:58] <HowardwLo> my response data is a text version of the dom
[23:55:48] <montag> HowardwLo: did you try this http://stackoverflow.com/a/4466204/264970
[23:56:35] <HowardwLo> montag: no i have not. do you think this is better than storing the url in the html and parsing it after every ajax?
[23:58:15] <montag> don't know..
