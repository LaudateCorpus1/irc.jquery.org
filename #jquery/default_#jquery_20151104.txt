[00:29:36] <jak2000> similar to: http://bootsnipp.com/?
[01:32:08] <MAxou>  Can i use more than one input type hidden to send to my php file with jquery.post ? i dont understand why the first one go ok and not the two after
[01:33:29] <Uhkis> of course you can, show the code
[01:33:42] <jak2000> jquery not know the second hidden input
[01:33:45] <jak2000> Uhkis friend!
[01:34:09] <Uhkis> hello!
[01:34:46] <jak2000> MAxou create a jsfiddle
[01:34:51] <jak2000> Uhkis know: http://bootsnipp.com/   ?
[01:35:12] <Uhkis> what about that?
[01:35:40] <jak2000> this a bootstrap Form Builder... is very interesting
[01:36:03] <jak2000> you build the form and see the css and html copy to your form and voila
[01:36:34] <jak2000> i want know if exist something for: 1) Menu builder and 2) jquery modal form builder?
[01:36:38] <MAxou> It's ok I find my error
[01:36:41] <MAxou> thx
[01:36:58] <jak2000> :)
[01:39:51] <MAxou> strange my jquery execute my php file milion times -_-
[01:40:04] <Uhkis> jak2000: dont know, google probably helps
[01:40:08] <jak2000> f12 is your friend
[02:09:13] <jak2000> exist a jquery Month Calendar plugin?
[02:10:19] <Blaster> Hmm, I have a globally initialized variable, and I set the value in the callback of a $.post(), and then I try to access the value in a click event handler that occurs after the post request, and I get "variable" is undefined. Any insights?
[02:16:00] <Ou42> hello. JQM Noobie here. Trying to get Form Submit buttons to inline, but they won't. I get the rounded corners on the outside buttons, but they aren't on one line. They also aren't shrinking to the size of the label. Any clues?
[02:16:02] <kevireilly_> Blaster: can you confirm that the setting happens before the accessing? another potential explanation is a locally scoped variable of the same name
[02:16:49] <Blaster> kevireilly_: Yeah something is fishy. It's kind of complex but this is essentially my setup and it works in this context so I need to dig deeper. http://jsfiddle.net/aeyc58jL/
[02:20:53] <Blaster> kevireilly_: They say not to use globals in ##javascript. :\
[02:26:19] <kevireilly_> Blaster: I agree with the discussion taking place there and my initial question was a lead in to something similar
[02:34:33] <Ou42> Does data-inline="true" not work for submit input's?
[02:34:45] <jak2000> is for?
[02:38:20] <Ou42> 2+2?
[02:39:47] <jak2000> 4
[02:40:36] <Cork> Ou42: it is prob a good idea to mention it is for jqm
[02:40:50] <Cork> (i don't use jqm so can't answer)
[02:41:06] <Ou42> Cork: no worries. I did the first time. :/
[02:41:28] <Cork> better include it every time
[02:41:37] <Ou42> gotcha! ;)
[02:41:48] <Ou42> what is the current ver of jQM?
[02:42:06] <Cork> http://jquerymobile.com/
[02:43:12] <Ou42> funny. I'm there. I have linked to 1.2 because of demo's from there. Now I'm seeing 1.4 stuff.
[03:01:07] <Ou42> is there a reason why a jQM webpage would look vastly different in Chrome vs. FF?
[03:07:26] <hellyeah> i have an ajax call this ajax call has beforesend and done
[03:07:26] <hellyeah> i am executing function in before send
[03:07:41] <hellyeah> when done happen i want to stop the function
[03:07:41] <hellyeah> this is the story does it make sense?
[03:16:51] <Uhkis> try adding a happy ending to the story!
[03:17:20] <hellyeah> what
[03:17:23] <hellyeah> :XD
[03:20:10] <Ou42> you want the AJAX to do the Submit and prohibit the HTML from Submitting it again?
[03:45:03] <MAxou> what is the correct syntax to add the var in the second line plz :
[03:45:04] <MAxou> var form_class = document.getElementById('data-value-ss_id');
[03:45:05] <MAxou> 	$(".delform_'+form_class+'").submit(function()
[03:45:29] <Pazician> How do I make an if else statement for iOS device with JS?
[03:46:17] <Cork> MAxou: you have to have the variable outside the string
[03:46:26] <Pazician> I need for specific version, version iOS 7
[03:46:29] <Cork> $('.delform_'+form_class)
[03:46:51] <Cork> Pazician: you don't
[03:47:09] <Pazician> Cork: What you mean? It's not possible?
[03:47:19] <Cork> Pazician: if you want to check for a feature you do feature sniffing
[03:47:20] <MAxou> thx
[03:47:35] <Cork> Pazician: it is strongly discouraged
[03:48:00] <Cork> Pazician: cause it either locks that vendor into not fixing the bug (if that is what your dealing with)
[03:48:29] <Cork> or it locks out other vendors, and make them have to emulate being that vendor
[03:48:34] <Pazician> Cork: I'm just looking to display a message IF the user is on iOS 7
[03:49:09] <Cork> Pazician: the only way you might be able to do it is through the browser user agent string
[03:49:20] <Cork> but i'm not sure if the os version is exposed there in safari
[03:51:02] <Pazician> Cork: I'm looking into this thread, is it something like this you mean? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19106645/how-does-one-differentiate-between-chrome-and-safari-in-an-ios7-useragent-string
[03:51:20] <Cork> yes
[03:51:38] <Pazician> Would that work?
[03:51:49] <Cork> though note useragent sniffing is error prone
[03:52:16] <Cork> for example that sniffer in that thread will fail if ios ever goes > 9
[03:54:44] <Cork> you might be able to do something like navigator.userAgent.match(/(iPhone|iTable) OS 7_0/)
[03:54:57] <Cork> but i'm not sure that is safe and won't break
[03:55:36] <Pazician> Cork: Like this? http://pastebin.com/E4SNKMRB
[03:55:48] <Cork> no, like i said that one is broken
[03:56:10] <Pazician> What you mean with broken?
[03:56:40] <Cork> it will break as the system version changes
[03:56:48] <Cork> as it assumes the number won't get more numbers
[03:58:35] <Cork> also note mobile browsers lie in the useragent cause too many sites to broken mobile web detection
[03:58:54] <Cork> so it is FAR from a reliable way to detect things
[03:59:56] <Pazician> So I should not use that code I got from the thread?
[04:00:03] <Pazician> Do you've an alternative?
[04:00:03] <Cork> yes
[04:00:29] <Cork> i gave you one that with some modification should be less broken (i don't have a device to test the string on)
[04:00:52] <Cork> but note like i said, useragent sniffing is broken, and will always be broken
[04:01:16] <Cork> so what ever you do expect that you get a none marginal false match
[04:06:16] <Pazician> Alright, I understand - thank you for you help :)
[04:07:05] <MAxou> this is correct to get the value of data-value-ss_id -> var form_class = document.getElementById('data-value-ss_id').value; ???
[04:07:45] <Cork> no
[04:07:51] <MAxou> erf
[04:08:29] <Cork> that is if data-value-ss_id isn't something like <div id="data-value-ss_id"></div>
[04:08:59] <Cork> MAxou: do you need to use native javascript api or can you use jquery?
[04:09:09] <MAxou> i can se jquery
[04:09:12] <MAxou> but I m noob
[04:09:28] <Cork> ok, make a jsfiddle with the markup you need to work with
[04:09:41] <MAxou> just in your ex
[04:09:46] <MAxou> how cna i get the value of id ?
[04:09:59] <Cork> value of id?
[04:10:06] <Uhkis> with jquery it's easy as $(element).data('value-ss_id')
[04:10:08] <Cork> MAxou: your leaving out too much context
[04:10:19] <Cork> Uhkis: your assuming it is an attribute
[04:10:37] <Uhkis> Cork: it's an educated assumption!
[04:10:58] <Cork> ya, i've learned over the years to be careful with though though ;)
[04:11:05] <Cork> ppl use the strangest ids
[04:11:12] <MAxou> ok I explain
[04:11:20] <Cork> MAxou: make a jsfiddle
[04:11:23] <Uhkis> dont explain, make a jsfiddle
[04:11:42] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:12:43] <MAxou> I use data-value-ss_id="<?php echo $row['ss_id'];?>" in my table.. I want get the valu of data-value-ss_id in my javascript
[04:13:10] <mooncup> $(selector).data('ss_id')
[04:13:32] <Cork> no, that's wrong
[04:13:45] <Cork> MAxou: again, please make a jsfiddle
[04:14:15] <Cork> writing a selector for the element you want the data from is the bigger part of the question here
[04:14:26] <Cork> cause if possible you want to avoid attribute selectors
[04:20:10] <MAxou> dont understand how work this jsfiddle
[04:20:31] <Cork> enter the html you need to access in the top left and hit save
[04:20:33] <Cork> then post the link here
[05:22:27] <Lundy> Morning folks
[05:26:21] <Kamuela> Morning Lundy
[05:27:36] <Lundy> How are you?
[05:27:54] <hellyeah> hey i want to stop function in done method can it be a solution to give parameter value as 0? https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/84/
[05:50:39] <mikecmpbll> i have a bunch of elements with data-attribute data-test="...". is there a straight forward way to get the first element for each unique value of that data attribute?
[05:51:18] <mikecmpbll> (without knowing the values in advance?)
[05:52:08] <hellyeah> mikecmpbll:
[05:52:11] <mikecmpbll> i'd like to group the elements by the data attribute value, really. i can do it in a bunch of lines of JS but wasn't sure if there was some neat jquery convenience i was overlooking
[05:52:12] <hellyeah> can you make a fiddle?
[05:52:16] <mikecmpbll> hellyeah: sure, sec
[05:54:04] <mikecmpbll> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/t71rpopg/
[05:58:32] <Cork> mikecmpbll: and you want "group1" even if data-something-else was the name?
[06:00:41] <hellyeah> could you use timeout in n ajax?
[06:00:47] <mikecmpbll> Cork: no specifically for one data attribute :)
[06:00:48] <Cork> mikecmpbll: not the cleanest code but http://jsfiddle.net/t71rpopg/1/
[06:01:10] <Cork> ah
[06:01:22] <Cork> well ya you would have to replace the .first() with a loop
[06:01:27] <Cork> and store what element you've hidden
[06:01:44] <Cork> mikecmpbll: there isn't a selector for what your trying to do
[06:01:45] <mikecmpbll> gotcha. or store the value of the data attribute for which i've already hidden an element?
[06:01:53] <Cork> i recommend using a class instead
[06:02:00] <Cork> it is explicitly what it is meant for
[06:02:10] <hellyeah> do a class
[06:02:14] <mikecmpbll> fair do's. i thought it felt a bit against the grain.
[06:02:17] <hellyeah> addClass("smt")
[06:03:44] <hellyeah> mikecmpbll: http://jsfiddle.net/t71rpopg/5/
[06:03:52] <Cork> mikecmpbll: http://jsfiddle.net/t71rpopg/6/
[06:04:35] <Cork> you could make it a loop if you prefer
[06:04:38] <mikecmpbll> Cork: oh cool :) that's neat
[06:04:43] <mikecmpbll> thanks!
[06:04:47] <Cork> np
[06:05:21] <Cork> i missed the space after ~ though :)
[06:05:49] <mikecmpbll> i think i'll have to loop anyways, because the specific identifier (class name in this instance) isn't known
[06:06:06] <hellyeah> Cork: i want to stop the function in done method that i execute in beforeSecnd. I give 0 to variable ibelongs to function. I dont know it is good way do you have any suggestion https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/57/
[06:06:15] <mikecmpbll> i can enforce a pattern though, e.g. 'some_prefix_*'
[06:06:51] <Cork> mikecmpbll: what do you feel about adding it as a class and as a data attribute?
[06:07:09] <Cork> meaning data-type="group2"
[06:07:10] <mikecmpbll> Cork: i'm cool with that
[06:08:15] <Cork> then you could do something like $('p').map(function() { return $(this).data('type'); });
[06:08:22] <Cork> and then build a selector from the array
[06:08:38] <Cork> you might want to remove the duplicates, but it isn't a must, css supports that
[06:33:21] <mikecmpbll> fwiw, this is the best i think i can get it: http://jsfiddle.net/t71rpopg/7/
[06:50:06] <rindolf> Hi all.
[06:53:21] <itai86> why is making a function within a loop a bad idea?
[06:53:55] <itai86> It comes up with a little exclamation mark warning me against it, it would appear that it's the most efficient thing to do.
[06:55:34] <rindolf> itai86: hi.
[06:55:54] <rindolf> itai86: a function within a loop will be declared and defined times and again.
[06:56:17] <rindolf> itai86: you can try doing var my_func = function (...) { ... }; instead.
[06:57:29] <Uhkis> itai86: what IDE is that?
[06:58:03] <itai86> http://npaste.de/p/rN/
[06:58:42] <itai86> it looks okay for looping through and sorting nested arrays though, why would that be bad?
[07:30:16] <Sendoushi> hey guys! anyone knows a min-footprint/min-size drag and drop plugin for the jquery lib?
[07:30:21] <hellyeah> yo
[07:30:27] <Sendoushi> i really just want something where you drag an element onto another and then return to its place
[07:30:38] <hellyeah> is there a way to optimize ajax request for better performance?
[07:30:56] <hellyeah> like drag and drop
[07:30:57] <hellyeah> ?
[07:31:11] <Sendoushi> hellyeah: hmm yes?
[07:31:23] <Sendoushi> regarding the optimizing of ajax request i think there isn't
[07:31:24] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[07:31:34] <hellyeah> try this one
[07:31:39] <Sendoushi> hellyeah: that is ui :) which isn't min footprint or min size
[07:31:45] <hellyeah> ops
[07:31:46] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:31:48] <Sendoushi> maybe... is that modularized?
[07:31:54] <Sendoushi> if it is maybe I can use it...
[07:32:00] <hellyeah> probably
[07:32:13] <hellyeah> you can take a look
[07:32:21] <Sendoushi> it wouldnt make sense to include such a big lib just for a drag and drop
[07:32:33] <hellyeah> they have extra feature
[07:32:41] <hellyeah> dialog is resizable
[07:32:58] <Sendoushi> yes but... if you dont want to use it who cares? :P
[07:33:10] <hellyeah> you are right
[07:33:11] <hellyeah> :XDF
[07:33:36] <Sendoushi> in this case it is a simple drag and drop
[07:33:51] <Sendoushi> i could even make such plugin but i dont want to spend that time. deadlines and there must be a solution around
[07:34:27] <hellyeah> actually i dont know min footprints
[07:34:31] <hellyeah> unfortunately
[08:53:28] <hellyeah> yo
[08:57:24] <hellyeah> i want to move json object index to another aray
[08:57:32] <hellyeah> is map true choice here?
[08:57:35] <sigdk> why would I download jQuery 2 if jQuery 1 supports IE as well ?
[08:57:48] <taplar> sigdk: if your not going to support IE, it's smaller
[08:58:05] <Cork> sigdk: it also supports a few things not possible in 1.x
[08:58:08] <taplar> sorry
[08:58:09] <sigdk> taplar, other than that ? does it offer something more ?
[08:58:10] <taplar> older IE
[08:58:13] <sigdk> ok
[08:58:16] <Cork> like .fail for jsonp
[08:58:36] <taplar> hellyeah: what are you trying to do?
[08:59:00] <hellyeah> i want to put json object into array
[08:59:13] <taplar> ok?
[08:59:19] <hellyeah> json index speerated by "," if i understand correctly
[08:59:24] <sigdk> and which of the two should I download ? jquery*.min.js or jquery.js ?
[08:59:33] <hellyeah> so each index of array will have json string
[08:59:37] <taplar> sigdk: typically you want the min
[08:59:56] <taplar> you only need the non min if, for some reason, you want to browse the source
[09:00:06] <hellyeah> like project_name : SearchEngine, environment = Prod , frontend : Monitor, button_name: something
[09:00:11] <taplar> but for a productional machine you want min
[09:00:27] <taplar> hellyeah: an array won't have a string key
[09:00:30] <hellyeah> it would be arr[0 = project_name] will contain Search Engine
[09:00:46] <hellyeah> ops
[09:01:07] <hellyeah> arr[0][0 is project_name index] will contain searchengine
[09:01:41] <taplar> var myarray = [];  myarray.push({ "project_name": "searchengine" });  myarray[0] === { "project_name": "searchengine" };
[09:01:45] <hellyeah> arr[0][1 is enviroment], arr[0][2 is frontend], arr[0][3 is button_name]
[09:01:54] <hellyeah> i am not sure it is possible it is on my mind
[09:02:22] <taplar> why do you need a numeric index for an object property?
[09:02:32] <taplar> you have descriptive names for them
[09:03:00] <hellyeah> hmm may be i dont need
[09:03:21] <taplar> you can have a 2d array, but i'm not sure what problem your trying to solve
[09:03:40] <taplar> you can have a n'd array for that matter
[09:05:08] <hellyeah> just a sec i will take a look
[09:10:55] <hellyeah> taplar: i just want to reach the spesific part but that gave undefined https://jsfiddle.net/L2a49xz4/17/
[09:11:25] <Eburitus> why doesn't this open dialog from button? http://pastebin.com/guM7xMPa
[09:11:30] <taplar> your putting a single string in the array
[09:11:40] <taplar> you can't do dot notation off of a string
[09:12:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:12:24] <hellyeah> sec
[09:12:46] <hellyeah> i suppose to reach o index of my Array
[09:12:47] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/L2a49xz4/21/
[09:12:49] <taplar> Eburitus: what does your console say?  and you should bind in your js, not your markup
[09:13:18] <hellyeah> i understood
[09:13:28] <taplar> hellyeah: your creating your array inside your for each also
[09:13:39] <rindolf> Eburitus: you don't call openDialog() anywhere.
[09:13:42] <taplar> it's going to get wiped out each iteration, and be deleted after the loop ends
[09:13:50] <taplar> rindolf: he has an inline onclick
[09:13:56] <hellyeah> i understood
[09:13:58] <rindolf> taplar: ah.
[09:15:25] <hellyeah> it is okey now https://jsfiddle.net/L2a49xz4/23/
[09:15:33] <Eburitus> rindolf: doesn't <BUTTON onclick="openDialog()">lorem<BUTTON> do the trick?
[09:15:49] <rindolf> Eburitus: it does, but you have double d there.
[09:15:59] <rindolf> Eburitus: you misspelled openDialog
[09:16:04] <Eburitus> rindolf: ty :D
[09:16:10] <rindolf> Eburitus: you're welcome .
[09:16:19] <robhol> Did someone say double D?!
[09:16:24] <taplar> hellyeah: that looks syntatically fine
[09:17:08] <rindolf> robhol: it's not what you're thinking. :-)
[09:17:22] <robhol> aww :(
[09:17:24] <taplar> he's actually talking about batteries
[09:17:32] <hellyeah> i have an idea to make this two dimensional array
[09:17:59] <taplar> why do you need a 2d array?
[09:18:40] <hellyeah> i will have buttons. Buttons have json string
[09:18:59] <hellyeah> i will compare these two in order to give name to the button
[09:19:15] <taplar> 'these two' ?
[09:19:46] <naschine> Quote of the day: "I will have buttons" - hellyeah
[09:19:47] <naschine> ;P
[09:19:56] <hellyeah> if json string project_name, environment, frontend in buttondata is equal two project_name, environment, frontend in the array give button_name as name to the button
[09:20:06] <hellyeah> naschine: xD
[09:20:13] <hellyeah> lookks funny :X
[09:20:16] <taplar> huh?
[09:20:20] <taplar> that makes no sense
[09:20:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:21:12] <hellyeah> may be not
[09:21:18] <taplar> you create a button per object, yes?
[09:21:45] <taplar> shouldn't it's name be related to that single object then?
[09:22:28] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/L2a49xz4/27/ if project_name , environment, frontend is equal to button data-jsonparameter
[09:22:35] <hellyeah> taplar: yes
[09:23:06] <taplar> -_-
[09:23:09] <hellyeah> is it possible to reach button_name here
[09:23:22] <hellyeah> taplar: the idea is new i need to think about it
[09:23:34] <hellyeah> i think to keep those values like key and value
[09:23:47] <hellyeah> key is project_name value is SearchEngine for example
[09:24:06] <taplar> my point is your creating the buttons per object.  so why do you need to compare the object to something to know if it should have a certain name?  you just created it for that object.  of course its going to match
[09:24:37] <hellyeah> actually example is wrong
[09:24:42] <hellyeah> actually not name
[09:24:57] <hellyeah> actually in original examplke
[09:25:06] <hellyeah> i need to colorize the button
[09:25:26] <hellyeah> i have several records that are in same project_name, environment, frontend
[09:25:47] <hellyeah> also they have column info that can be red, orange, blue, gray, green
[09:25:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:26:00] <hellyeah> i will ask tomorrow
[09:26:08] <hellyeah> i am confused
[09:26:16] <taplar> so at the time of creation, evaluate those three fields and put a class on the button related to that grouping
[09:26:21] <hellyeah> taplar: i need to wrap up my head
[09:26:41] <hellyeah> all buttons have same class
[09:26:49] <hellyeah> this is what you meant i guess
[09:27:02] <hellyeah> i will reach all buttons by selecting class
[09:27:10] <taplar> i thought you were alluding to different groups having different colors
[09:27:15] <hellyeah> when i do each i can reach buttons one bt one
[09:27:37] <naschine> I don't get why you don't access the object properties directly? like this for example https://jsfiddle.net/L2a49xz4/28/
[09:27:41] <hellyeah> taplar: data has json parameters and my array will have similar json string
[09:27:47] <hellyeah> i will compare those two
[09:28:01] <taplar> hellyeah: your making it hard on yourself by trying to do it that way
[09:28:02] <hellyeah> then i will check color column in the array
[09:28:03] <taplar> is what i'm saying
[09:28:11] <hellyeah> if it contains red color will be red
[09:28:19] <hellyeah> humm
[09:28:24] <hellyeah> ic
[09:28:52] <MAxou> how can i build a JS with php inside ? http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/
[09:28:55] <hellyeah> can you repeat what was your suggestion?
[09:29:05] <MAxou> A jsfidle
[09:29:42] <taplar> php inside?
[09:30:02] <hellyeah> but you understand my thing i guess
[09:30:12] <MAxou> I mean how cna i emulate my problem to show you
[09:30:17] <MAxou> with jsfidle ?
[09:30:29] <taplar> hellyeah: at the time of button creation you have the object your creating the button for.  at that point you don't have to compare objects to know other information.  you can evaluate that object to know what you need to do, be it apply a particular class or whatever
[09:30:34] <hellyeah> also i will have counter taplar for red records, orange records, etc.
[09:30:48] <hellyeah> and when you see red in the column this counter counts up one
[09:30:49] <taplar> MAxou: typically you'd put in the resulting html/javascript/css to display the issue
[09:30:58] <hellyeah> so you can reach the table by clicking buttons
[09:31:08] <hellyeah> and with the help of counter and the help of color of button
[09:31:20] <hellyeah> you will know the amount of records in spesific colors
[09:31:25] <hellyeah> let me read
[09:31:30] * naschine has no idea what hellyeah is up to xD
[09:31:41] <taplar> hellyeah: i'd need to see an actual example of what your trying to do to advise you
[09:31:45] <hellyeah> naschine: i am confused my english can be suck
[09:31:51] <taplar> right now it's coming across as theoritical
[09:32:09] <hellyeah> sure
[09:32:15] <hellyeah> but work time is almost end
[09:32:17] <naschine> hellyeah: almost every sentence is quote worthy ;P
[09:32:22] <hellyeah> i will prepare tmorrow
[09:32:29] <hellyeah> xD
[09:32:42] <MAxou> http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/ if someone can help me .. I try to get the value of data-value-ss_id="<?php echo $row['ss_id'];?>" in the first line of my js help please
[09:33:03] <noobie_> I'm hoping someone can help me with my code.  I'm trying to change the text below my timer to remove/add the S to the text based on the value === 1. http://kopy.io/ofJ88
[09:33:12] <taplar> MAxou: is that javascript in a .js file?
[09:33:45] <MAxou> no
[09:33:51] <MAxou> beetwyn [script]
[09:33:54] <taplar> is it in a .php file?
[09:34:05] <MAxou> yes
[09:34:07] <taplar> k
[09:34:42] <MAxou> it's just a part of thie page
[09:34:56] <taplar> so your just wanting to access the data elements?
[09:35:00] <taplar> you can use data() for taht
[09:35:30] <MAxou> I want to know the value of the data
[09:35:39] <MAxou> to use it after in the script
[09:35:51] <Cork> MAxou: you will have multiple values though
[09:36:02] <taplar> ex: <input class="me" data-myName="weee">   $('.me').data('myname');
[09:36:04] <Cork> so you can't just make a single lookup
[09:36:27] <MAxou> why multiple ?
[09:36:41] <Cork> <?php foreach <--
[09:36:45] <MAxou> yea ..
[09:36:51] <Cork> you will have one data-value-ss_id per row
[09:36:56] <MAxou> yeah
[09:37:07] <JPost> anyone available for a quick second?
[09:37:07] <Cork> so grabbing it once won't work
[09:37:30] <MAxou> maybe i can do same thing in better way ?
[09:37:51] <Cork> MAxou: what are you trying to do
[09:38:11] <MAxou> a buton to archi the row
[09:38:15] <MAxou> in sql
[09:38:27] <MAxou> and with a litle effect on table
[09:38:30] <MAxou> witheout reload page
[09:38:49] <Cork> MAxou: well to start with, you don't have to put the value on the row AND a td
[09:38:55] <Cork> just do it once
[09:39:03] <JPost> i have a drop down menu, id like a image to show up (or change) when i make a different selection.. jquery, css
[09:39:24] <taplar> JPost: what have you tried?
[09:39:29] <Cork> ah, now i'm starting to see what happens here
[09:39:35] <MAxou> yes sorry it's useless thing for testing
[09:39:56] <Cork> MAxou: the data is already in the form, you don't need to do what you're doing there
[09:39:57] <JPost> $('option.attached.enabled:contains("Black")').css("color", "red"); .. ive tried this, just to try and get a reaction.. nothing
[09:40:22] <taplar> JPost: I mean what type of bindings are you doing?
[09:40:29] <Cork> MAxou: one min
[09:41:24] <JPost> im not sure what you mean taplar, ive never really messed with jquery, javascript
[09:41:27] <MAxou> yeah Cork I retrive the same data in the input hiden after in the script and work fine
[09:41:40] <taplar> ah, ok, well first: learn.jquery.com
[09:41:57] <taplar> and second, you'll need to bind and event handler to work with the change
[09:42:19] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:42:34] <taplar> the event your after in this case is most likely 'change'
[09:42:44] <Cork> MAxou: http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/1/
[09:42:46] <Cork> that should do it
[09:43:01] <Cork> MAxou: an important point, NEVER use return false; in event handlers
[09:43:10] <Cork> always use event.preventDefault()
[09:43:22] <Cork> or you will make it impossible for other event handlers to extend it if needed
[09:44:07] <MAxou> oh ok
[09:44:17] <MAxou> I try your code but I understand nothing :D
[09:44:27] <Cork> MAxou: the different data- attributes for the id isn't needed
[09:44:29] <Cork> you can remove them
[09:44:39] <Cork> MAxou: let me explain it first
[09:44:49] <Cork> MAxou: i bind a delegated event listener on the table
[09:44:58] <Cork> it catches all the different form submit events
[09:45:16] <Cork> then i from the form serialize the hidden fields
[09:45:24] <Cork> that is what you did manually before
[09:45:40] <Cork> in the .done callback i look for the parent tr from the form
[09:45:59] <Cork> and then select the "result" class (you might want to rename that)
[09:46:08] <Cork> and enter the "archived" value
[09:46:28] <Cork> so the function is based on the dom structure instead of attributes
[09:46:50] <Cork> MAxou: also another important note, you didn't defined your variables
[09:46:53] <Cork> so they where all globals
[09:47:00] <Cork> (not a grate idea)
[09:47:29] <MAxou> I dont understand all but
[09:47:35] <MAxou> I think something will not work
[09:48:06] <Cork> MAxou: it should do the same as your original code
[09:48:10] <MAxou> because I dont pas it but there a tr hide too betwyn each main tr in the for each
[09:49:15] <Cork> MAxou: the result and the form is in the same tr
[09:49:20] <Cork> that is all that matters
[09:49:30] <MAxou> yeah .. ok
[09:49:51] <Cork> at least for the code you put in the jsfiddle :)
[09:50:00] <Cork> if you have something not in there that depends on things
[09:50:05] <Cork> it might be a different thing
[09:50:23] <MAxou> so I neeed to put classe to my tr and change .result with the class name ?
[09:50:31] <Cork> no
[09:50:52] <Cork> you need to change <td data-value-ss_id="<?php echo $row['ss_id'];?>"> to <td class="result">
[09:51:00] <Cork> that's it
[09:51:11] <Cork> you most likely can remove a lot of attributes
[09:51:19] <MAxou> the td ok
[09:51:19] <Cork> but they won't break the script
[09:51:24] <Cork> the result class is all that matters
[09:53:58] <MAxou> cork ok I try this
[09:57:02] <MAxou> problem the crip executing for eac row
[09:58:42] <JPost> lol. i give up for now.. just came off of graveyard shift and cant think that much, or read that much
[09:59:02] <taplar> :)
[10:00:34] <MAxou> cork : help dont work I exec the delete.php for each row
[10:00:43] <MAxou> with same value -_-
[10:01:06] <Cork> MAxou: make sure the hidden fields in the form contain the correct values
[10:01:14] <Cork> if they are the js should work
[10:01:31] <Cork> (look in the browser at the generated html, not the php)
[10:02:16] <MAxou> yes they are
[10:03:34] <JPost> the tag is <option> the class is "attached enabled"  .. maybe im not calling it right? option.attached.enabled
[10:04:00] <MAxou> it's why i try to select this particular form and not all form in the table
[10:04:17] <Cork> <option class="attached enabled"> would match that selector
[10:04:33] <Cork> MAxou: i'm not selecting all forms in the table
[10:04:56] <Cork> MAxou: the button triggers a submit on the form so "this" in the event handler is that specific form
[10:05:04] <Cork> not all of them
[10:05:09] <MAxou> ok
[10:05:24] <MAxou> but after he do submit on all of them
[10:05:45] <MAxou> with good value
[10:06:32] <MAxou> because it's really a delete function but archiv
[10:06:35] <Cork> MAxou: if the form is closed correctly so the the error correction doesn't merge things
[10:06:39] <Cork> that shouldn't happen
[10:08:20] <MAxou> it is ..
[10:08:34] <MAxou> can we say to javascript to execute this just 1 times ?
[10:08:39] <Cork> well generate an html section without the php and i could help you
[10:08:53] <Cork> MAxou: as long as the html is correct it would only be once
[10:11:03] <MAxou> cork just : I use your script like this
[10:11:07] <MAxou> witheout any modif
[10:13:26] <Cork> MAxou: as the markup isn't in a state where the fiddle can be ran i can't completely help you with the problem
[10:13:37] <Cork> only hint you at how it should be possible to solve it
[10:14:01] <Cork> MAxou: i recommend running the page through w3c validator and make sure the markup is valid
[10:14:08] <Cork> that might be what is breaking for you
[10:14:48] <decx> now that's a tip i haven't seen in a long time ^^
[10:14:54] <ul71m0> so i have 2 jquery accordions on my page, they are side by side, and i want to limit that only one item can be visible in both accordions is that possible?
[10:15:53] <decx> isn't that standard behaviour?
[10:16:05] <MAxou> cork : IO Error: HTTP resource not retrievable. The HTTP status from the remote server was: 401.
[10:16:05] <MAxou> Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
[10:16:35] <Cork> <_<
[10:16:45] <Cork> uh... ya cause it couldn't get the content...
[10:16:57] <MAxou> there is a htacces
[10:17:01] <MAxou> but he ask me
[10:17:21] <MAxou> I will do by file upload
[10:17:58] <Cork> use the generated html though
[10:18:03] <Cork> not the php file...
[10:18:10] <ul71m0> decx: its standard in one accordion, but i have 2 accordions on same page
[10:18:40] <decx> so you want it to behave like a single accordion in columns
[10:18:51] <ul71m0> yes
[10:18:59] <ul71m0> both have same class
[10:19:21] <decx> use an appropriate event to close the others open slides then
[10:19:36] <MAxou> omg i try to display the sourc of the page my computer dont like ^^
[10:19:42] <decx> i'll give it a whirl too
[10:19:47] <JPost> jQuery(function($){  could that be causing my script not to work? i dont see any other issues..
[10:20:19] <Cork> JPost: no, that is just to make it wait for the page to load completely (and redefine $ as jQuery)
[10:21:27] <MAxou> o m g
[10:21:40] <MAxou> 602 eror or warning :D
[10:22:33] <JPost> i have it on jsfiddle working fine.. when i try it on my wordpress page, it doesnt produce the same results
[10:23:36] <taplar> JPost: what's your fiddle?
[10:24:36] <decx> ul71m0: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/tjhxty4y/
[10:24:48] <JPost> http://jsfiddle.net/KHDWL/109/
[10:25:10] <JPost> the only difference, i had to remove the style on the select tag to have it show up on the fiddle
[10:25:14] <ul71m0> decx: awesome :) thanks
[10:25:53] <taplar> JPost: jsfiddle also includes the script last so no need for a document ready.  might not be the case for your code
[10:26:26] <ul71m0> decx++
[10:26:27] <taplar> ah, nvm, $() does that too
[10:26:39] <decx> ul71m0: np
[10:26:48] <taplar> JPost: so do you get your alert at all?
[10:26:55] <JPost> i dont get any alert
[10:27:19] <taplar> what do you get if you put this immediately before your binding
[10:27:25] <taplar> console.log( $('#pa_stringcolor').length );
[10:28:09] <JPost> if i dont define $ as jquery on wordpress i get $ is not a function.. one second, and i will test it
[10:28:25] <taplar> console.log( jQuery('#pa_stringcolor').length );
[10:28:31] <taplar> would also work
[10:28:36] <MAxou> Cork can we just modiy a litle my start script ?
[10:29:08] <JPost> it comes up at 1
[10:29:47] <taplar> ok, so it is finding the element
[10:30:03] <taplar> not sure then
[10:30:38] <taplar> also if your just after the value you don't have to wrap the element: http://jsfiddle.net/KHDWL/110/
[10:33:30] <MAxou> if someone can help me http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/ or http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/1/ with Cork solution
[10:34:22] <JPost> maybe an issue with wordpress.. i will have to look deeper.. i think ive got what i need to come up with an image and such.
[10:34:40] <JPost> thanks for the help taplar.
[10:34:49] <naschine> JPost: no conflict mode maybe? -> http://jsfiddle.net/6x6mndvb/
[10:36:45] <duikb00t> http://plugins.gravitysign.com/colio/index_white.html
[10:36:49] <duikb00t> Is it hard creating something like that? :)
[10:37:56] <decx> no
[10:38:27] <JPost> didnt work naschine
[10:38:59] <duikb00t> decx im already here
[10:39:30] <duikb00t> http://codepen.io/wardkennes/pen/BoVEow
[10:40:38] <decx> keep at it
[10:40:58] <MAxou> if someone can help me http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/ or http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/1/ with Cork solution
[10:41:41] <duikb00t> The problem is I have no idea how to remove the selection from the current type when you select an item
[10:42:11] <decx> have a look at the following methods: siblings(), filter()
[10:43:30] <duikb00t> decx I think it's about the click handler.
[10:43:41] <duikb00t> Where I do: $('.thumbs active').css('background-color','red');
[10:43:49] <duikb00t> When you click a new item I want to clear the latest one.
[10:45:21] <decx> that's when you use the methods i suggested to traverse
[10:45:32] <taplar> is 'active' valid?
[10:46:17] <duikb00t> .active *
[10:46:24] <taplar> :D
[10:55:17] <itai86> my javascript kernel isn't loading in the atom editor. Does anyone have an idea why this would be? I have js17 installed, is there something I'm missing?
[10:55:22] <itai86> I'm using arch linux
[11:37:54] <MAxou> http://jsfiddle.net/d504brth/2/ but the jquery need a a second phpfile to run i dont know how emulate this .
[11:42:43] <robertmaxrees> MAxou what's the issue?
[11:43:39] <MAxou> robertmaxrees the issu is : when i clik on 1 submit button the script is exec number of row times
[11:43:56] <MAxou> if there is 80 row the script well exec 80 times
[11:44:30] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:45:04] <robertmaxrees> not from what i'm seeing here.
[11:45:24] <MAxou> i remove all php in the html
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> you can go ahead and do that ;)
[11:46:00] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't really clarify anything.
[11:46:00] <MAxou> that dont work :/
[11:46:04] <robertmaxrees> your code will execute once.
[11:46:22] <MAxou> can I pastebin the original code sourc ?
[11:46:29] <MAxou> maybe you will se what is the probleme
[11:46:33] <robertmaxrees> you can jsfiddle the javascript and html, yes.
[11:46:37] <robertmaxrees> no php though.
[11:49:01] <MAxou> robertmaxrees what can i dot can help you to help me ?
[11:49:33] <robertmaxrees> is the issue in your JS or in you php?
[11:50:03] <MAxou> in my JS i think
[11:50:14] <MAxou> my php do the good job
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> what you sent shows that the JS will only execute once.
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> whenever you submit a form.
[11:50:54] <MAxou> ok but on my page he exec delete.php number of rown time
[11:51:31] <robertmaxrees> your JS only has one binding.
[11:51:39] <robertmaxrees> is this js apart of a larger file?
[11:51:51] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if you're binding multiple times.
[11:52:17] <MAxou> no I use it in a [script]
[11:52:27] <robertmaxrees> but is that all of the js?
[11:52:35] <MAxou> yes
[11:52:43] <robertmaxrees> also: your html is kind of strange.
[11:53:04] <MAxou> why ?
[11:53:25] <MAxou> I remov all php from it
[11:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you're using onclick.
[11:53:28] <N00bie_> I'm hoping someone can help me with two issues.  Here is my code, http://kopy.io/zYfd5.  1) My scroll up is not working.  It just pops up to the top instead of a smooth scroll.  2)  I can't get my text in my timer to change based on == 1.
[11:53:45] <MAxou> it's for another script
[11:53:59] <robertmaxrees> MAxou doesn't matter - you don't need onclick ever
[11:54:23] <MAxou> you think that can make cnflict ?
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> just a general suggestion.
[11:54:41] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lzuov3v4/1/
[11:54:46] <robertmaxrees> the js is only executing once.
[11:55:00] <robertmaxrees> *once for each click.
[11:55:32] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ your click event handler doesn't define the event object.
[11:55:42] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ open your consoel and click #totp - you'll see what i mean.
[11:55:45] <MAxou> when i try your it happen nothing when i click del button
[11:55:56] <robertmaxrees> MAxou open your console.
[11:56:03] <robertmaxrees> see how only one console log fires?>
[11:56:51] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees I only get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'querySelector' of null in my console.
[11:57:07] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ yep :) you're going to need to fix your js errors.
[11:57:33] <MAxou> robertmaxrees in the consol I see lot of red things
[11:57:47] <robertmaxrees> MAxou on the fiddle or on your site?
[11:58:01] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ also - the event object isn't magically defined by default for event handlers.
[11:58:06] <N00bie_> I've been trying to for the past 2 hours but I can't figure out what it is.  I'm pretty new to jquery.  robertmaxrees
[11:58:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly pass it in.
[11:58:31] <MAxou> no on your I se you re right just on new line for 1 click
[11:58:49] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ so you have .click(function() { event.preventDefault(); }); right now, but "event" isn't anything.
[11:59:04] <MAxou> on my site : for 1 click he exec delete.php number of times of numbers of row
[11:59:08] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't exist - you need to pass it into the handler - .click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ MAxou
[11:59:53] <robertmaxrees> read through this for a basic tutorial on debugging.
[12:00:07] <N00bie_> robertmaxess I've fixed that but still getting the error and it's still not smooth scrolling.
[12:00:22] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ without seeing a functioning example it's really hard to help.
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of extra code going on in here.
[12:01:21] <N00bie_> Well the code is on my local machine.  I don't have it anywhere where it's accessible.
[12:01:30] <robertmaxrees> you can always make a fiddle ;)
[12:02:22] <MAxou> robermaxrees how this site will help me ?
[12:02:42] <robertmaxrees> MAxou you need to debug your code - without your side in front of me, I can't really help.
[12:03:21] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cfbd8yo0/
[12:03:33] <robertmaxrees> this works just fine.  so if you're still having js errors pop up, you need to fix those.
[12:03:42] <robertmaxrees> because earlier errors can cause later code to not execute.
[12:04:39] <MAxou> robertmaxrees I use webkitdev on my chrome
[12:04:46] <MAxou> but there is no erors
[12:04:55] <robertmaxrees> MAxou then use your debugger/console
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> you can do this ;)
[12:05:03] <MAxou> just the fact the script do the job but multiple times
[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> MAxou everything i'm seeing says that the js runs once, so the PHP looks like it might be the problem.
[12:06:15] <chingyy938> Hi guys, not sure why 3rd function is not printing https://jsfiddle.net/fm3mwarz/
[12:06:39] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 open your console
[12:06:51] <MAxou> the php is just a sql request to update something and insert something
[12:06:56] <MAxou> there is nothing inside
[12:07:06] <robertmaxrees> MAxou so how do you expect us to help you at this point?
[12:07:10] <chingyy938> Cannot read property 'childNodes' of undefined
[12:07:31] <MAxou> maybe i can show you my original source code ?
[12:07:32] <chingyy938> @ robertmaxrees
[12:07:37] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 yep - so fix it.
[12:07:42] <robertmaxrees> MAxou i don't do PHP
[12:08:09] <robertmaxrees> MAxou i highly encourage you to read that debugging tutorial which will help you troubleshoot the problem from the JS side.
[12:08:15] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/upvf9mwa/
[12:09:16] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees make that http://jsfiddle.net/upvf9mwa/1/
[12:09:39] <Whiskey> if i have $("#element") and it exist 5 of them
[12:09:43] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: could I get some assistance with that please, I will take on board your fix so I learn xd
[12:09:56] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey you can't have 5 of the same id.
[12:10:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery will select the first one only.
[12:10:03] <Whiskey> in there somewhere its .this1 .this2 .this3 .this4 .this5
[12:10:05] <MAxou> robermaxrees mabe the problem is I put my script in wron place
[12:10:08] <Whiskey> lets say its a class then
[12:10:22] <MAxou> so I generate it number of row times
[12:10:24] <Whiskey> how do you remove .this whit that has some of the other class in it whitout some of them?=
[12:10:34] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 you're not using jquery in there - ask in ##javascript.
[12:10:47] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey that question doesn't make any sense.  try again.
[12:10:52] <chingyy938> whatever lol
[12:11:02] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("ChangeInPercent")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue; is your issue.
[12:11:08] <robertmaxrees> there is no "ChangeInPercent"
[12:11:22] <robertmaxrees> but since you're not using jquery I'd suggest going to ##javascript - they can help you better there ;)
[12:11:42] <MAxou> robermaxrees what do you think about that ? if my <script></script> is present in each row maybe the problem is there ?
[12:11:47] <chingyy938> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:11:51] <chingyy938> fixed
[12:11:55] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: what part don toy get?
[12:11:58] <robertmaxrees> MAxou wait you have the js present multiple times?
[12:11:59] <Whiskey> you have a class that has name this
[12:12:06] <Whiskey> in that class it whatever class names
[12:12:12] <Whiskey> and somehwere in it it has 1 2 3 4 5 6
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey we've been over this before.  make a fiddle.
[12:12:20] <Whiskey> and i will remove this that contain some of this numbers
[12:12:27] <MAxou> robermaxrees I think yes  because he is inside the foreach who generate the row
[12:12:40] <robertmaxrees> MAxou... show me the rendered html.
[12:12:41] <Whiskey> but i don´t find how to go back and remove it when it has find the current class in it
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> the stuff actually sent to the browser.
[12:12:51] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey fiddle pls.  thx,
[12:13:25] <MAxou> ok the problem is here lol
[12:13:45] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: not sure how to do it
[12:13:47] <robertmaxrees> MAxou put your JS in a separate js file
[12:13:48] <MAxou> need to put my script in a good place :D
[12:14:16] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey your description doesn't make any sense.  show us a basic example.
[12:17:10] <MAxou> thaaaaaat work :D
[12:17:27] <robertmaxrees> MAxou in the future, you want to show us the rendered html, not the stuff from your server.
[12:17:54] <MAxou> yes ;p
[12:18:01] <MAxou> make mistake learn from it ^^
[12:18:02] <robertmaxrees> but cool - glad you figured it out.
[12:19:41] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/103/ how to find every one that has this and remove everyone espect the one that has class 3?
[12:20:32] <robertmaxrees> .filter();
[12:21:11] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees did you get to look at my fiddle?
[12:21:17] <Whiskey> wtf
[12:21:22] <Whiskey> has them think about everything
[12:21:24] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ your fiddle was just a grey background.
[12:21:37] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey how else would you learn?
[12:21:43] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[12:21:52] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/upvf9mwa/2/
[12:22:03] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ i don't see anything in there.
[12:22:17] <robertmaxrees> the result is just a grey background.
[12:22:19] <robertmaxrees> no text or anything.
[12:22:36] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xzLxas2s/104/ i mean, way simple.
[12:23:07] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ does this use bootstrap?
[12:23:09] <N00bie_> the text is showing on my side of the fiddle
[12:23:21] <Whiskey> kol
[12:23:22] <robertmaxrees> oh that's why.
[12:23:26] <Whiskey> thanks alot Robdgreat
[12:23:28] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees
[12:23:29] <Whiskey> again
[12:23:36] <N00bie_> Yes but none of the code I posted uses bootstrap
[12:23:37] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey in the future, you should try the solution presented before complaining ;)
[12:23:49] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ io see the issue - you're using features only supported by chrome.
[12:24:13] <abishekr> anybody here experienced with select2 plugin?
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> abishekr just ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will.
[12:24:36] <N00bie_> what am I using robertmaxrees?
[12:25:02] <abishekr> can't seem to get this working
[12:25:03] <abishekr> http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output
[12:25:05] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: find don´t allow mutliple selectors?
[12:25:11] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey sure does.
[12:25:28] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ http://i.imgur.com/rADogHK.png this is what you get in FF ;)
[12:25:41] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/105/
[12:25:42] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ but your issue isn't css related, right?
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> it's js related?
[12:25:57] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey one string, not mutliple.
[12:26:17] <N00bie_> it's js related.  I don't see why it's not rendering in FF.  I have all the correct CSS in there for it to show on all browsers.
[12:26:23] <Whiskey> aaa
[12:26:32] <Whiskey> looks more clean the way i did it but okay
[12:26:38] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey i disagree.
[12:26:45] <robertmaxrees> you're passing a selector - a selector is a string.
[12:26:50] <robertmaxrees> it's like that for all of jquery ;)
[12:27:14] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ i'm also not seeing the to top button even in chrome.
[12:27:38] <N00bie_> It's because it's font awesome.  Hang on
[12:28:09] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ back up - the issue is the totop button, right?
[12:28:10] <robertmaxrees> and what else?
[12:28:29] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: thanks alot :)
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_  works fine here.
[12:28:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/upvf9mwa/5/ N00bie_
[12:29:33] <N00bie_> http://jsfiddle.net/upvf9mwa/4/  I have two issues.  Top right button is not doing a smooth scroll and then I also have an issue with text displaying not changing (Hours, Minutes, etc).  I need them to change to Minute, Hour, Second etc.
[12:30:17] <N00bie_> robertmaxrees what did you change?
[12:30:20] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/upvf9mwa/7/
[12:30:28] <robertmaxrees> $('#toTop').click(function(){ -> $('#toTop').click(function(event){
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> like i said earlier.
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> the event object doesn't just exist by default.
[12:31:10] <MikeD_> surprising how that even needs to be said
[12:31:22] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, not to me.
[12:31:35] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people without JS experience aren't aware of how these things work.
[12:31:44] <MikeD_> the person building our 'framework' said "I don't use event object... just use $(this) ..."  (smh)
[12:31:51] <robertmaxrees> they just see "you need to put in event.preventDefault() in yur code and it'll be fine.
[12:31:59] <N00bie_> looking at your code, it's not there either. robertmaxrees
[12:32:07] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ yes it is.
[12:32:38] <robertmaxrees> N00bie_ http://i.imgur.com/j8gZBEb.png
[12:32:52] <N00bie_> Not when I view it.  ('#toTop').click(function(){
[12:32:53] <N00bie_>             event.preventDefault();
[12:32:53] <N00bie_>             $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: 0}, 'slow');
[12:32:53] <N00bie_>         });
[12:32:53] <N00bie_>     $(window).scroll(function(){
[12:32:53] <N00bie_>         if($(window).scrollTop() > 300)
[12:32:54] <N00bie_>         {
[12:32:54] <N00bie_>             console.log('More than 300');
[12:32:55] <N00bie_>             $('#toTop').fadeIn('slow');
[12:32:55] <N00bie_>         }else{
[12:32:55] <N00bie_>             console.log('Less than 300');
[12:32:56] <N00bie_>             $('#toTop').fadeOut('slow');
[12:32:57] <N00bie_>         }
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:32:57] <N00bie_>     });
[12:33:07] <robertmaxrees> don't paste into the channel please.
[12:33:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/upvf9mwa/8/ check this?
[12:33:27] <robertmaxrees> but it's in there.
[12:33:42] <N00bie_> Now it is.  #5 did not have it.
[12:33:50] <taplar> 7 did
[12:34:03] <N00bie_> Well thanks for the help.  I have to go.
[12:35:10] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:36:17] <MikeD_> is there a way to move a div from the parent section it's in to the body, so it can be absolutely positioned in front of everything else on the page and not get clipped by the positioning and overflow behavior of the section?
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ sure - $('body').append($('#yourDiv'));
[12:38:48] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ $.fn.append() moves elements around if they exist already.
[12:39:00] <MikeD_> nice, that was the question i was about to ask
[12:39:17] <HighOctane> Using jquery mobile's filterablebeforefilter function, I am making ajax requests to fill the info into a listview. Sometimes, responses from old requests come back after the most recent request has completed, messing up my results. How can I prevent that?
[12:39:59] <robertmaxrees> HighOctane caching issues maybe?
[12:40:48] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees, sorry for asking but is it any other way to write same thing?
[12:41:02] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey writing what same thing?
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> and why?
[12:41:15] <HighOctane> maybe. but i think it's more that I need to cancel previous requests somehow each time I make a new request.
[12:41:35] <HighOctane> not sure how to do it in the filterableBeforeFilter function
[12:41:43] <robertmaxrees> ooooh HighOctane that's what you mean - any reason you can't prevent the user from actioning until the current request has finished?
[12:41:54] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: $(".dataViewBox:not(:has(#nfoblock0h,#sfvblock0h))").remove() :)
[12:42:02] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey that's pretty bad.
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd still use .filter()
[12:42:07] <Whiskey> why?
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> :not() and :has() are slow.
[12:42:33] <robertmaxrees> also, shoving everytuing into a selector is super unreadable.
[12:42:46] <robertmaxrees> HighOctane http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446594/abort-ajax-requests-using-jquery
[12:44:45] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: no way to do this part diffrent? return !$(this).find('.3').length;
[12:44:51] <Whiskey> i think return ! looks strange
[12:44:53] <HighOctane> thanks robertmaxrees. I think that will help me. I just have to figure out where to plug that in. maybe a global variable on the page?
[12:45:25] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey that looks strange only because you don't understand return types and truthy/falsy values
[12:45:44] <MikeD_> that's true... but it's still kinda strange
[12:45:55] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[12:46:47] <robertmaxrees> HighOctane i always like to avoid global vars.  isnt't that event fired only on init?
[12:47:18] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: i still ask if it can be writen another way, maybe whit a if or something
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:47:36] <robertmaxrees> toss the fiddle my way again.
[12:47:46] <MikeD_> Whiskey: of course it can... do you know what it means in the first place?
[12:48:14] <robertmaxrees> but rejecting fully functional, well written solutions simply because you don't understand them is pretty... weird.
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> learn to understand what the code is doing.
[12:48:49] <HighOctane> robertmaxrees It gets fired whenever new characters are entered into the input box which is used to search for certain items from a database using ajax. Autocompletion
[12:49:20] <Whiskey> no not really
[12:49:22] <Whiskey> ! is not
[12:49:30] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey right, negation.
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> so $(this).find('.someClass').length - what does this do?
[12:49:53] <Whiskey> but i still wonder how it could be done whit another way
[12:49:55] <Whiskey> well
[12:50:01] <Whiskey> if .someClass i sfound
[12:50:08] <Whiskey> it will show a number
[12:50:17] <Whiskey> if its not found im not sure what it will show null maybe
[12:50:20] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey it could be done dozens of ways - the way i showed you is, imo, the best way to do it.
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey it'd return 0
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> HighOctane http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-autocomplete-remote/#&ui-state=dialog maybe check this out?
[12:52:02] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey so .filter() takes a predicate that needs a truthy or falsy value.
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> 0 is a falsy value, all other numbers are truthy.
[12:52:49] <Whiskey> strange
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[12:53:02] <robertmaxrees> welcome to JS - just need to learn the language.
[12:53:40] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/106/
[12:53:43] <Whiskey> something like that
[12:53:57] <robertmaxrees> "0" is a string and will always be truthy.
[12:54:06] <robertmaxrees> and that's trying to accomplish the exact same thing.
[12:54:27] <robertmaxrees> oh haha but it's coercing.  that's interesting.
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> if you're concerned about readability, abstract things out and give it a name
[12:55:41] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees yeh exactly
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> so do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xzLxas2s/107/
[12:56:22] <Whiskey> think my one was quite good
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> except you're using strings for some reason.
[12:56:37] <HighOctane> thanks robertmaxrees . That's the exact code stub that I started with. It has been working great for me. Notice in the source, nothing there to cancel previously made requests. Unless it's there and I'm just not seeing it
[12:56:41] <Whiskey> but maybe you was after: result === 0
[12:56:57] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey i'm after you not adding in an extra conditional when you don't need one./
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> hell, your code could be reduced to http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xzLxas2s/108/
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> which leads to exactly what I provided earlier.
[12:58:49] <Whiskey> yes
[12:58:51] <Whiskey> im find whit that one
[12:59:04] <Whiskey> fnnd it alot more easy to read
[12:59:06] <Whiskey> thats all
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> actually http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xzLxas2s/110/
[12:59:11] <robertmaxrees> like...
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> just learn javascript.  it's not that hard - mine is perfectly readable if you take a second to learn about truthy/falsy - you want to return the negated value of the .length call.
[13:00:13] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: i belive you know alot more then me
[13:00:20] <Whiskey> but less code don´t need to means that its batter
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> not at all, but your code reduces down to the exact same thing.
[13:01:05] <Whiskey> yeh but then i would like to know what it does two, its alot more clear whit the if
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> not to me.
[13:01:20] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees :=
[13:01:21] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees :=)
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> i know plenty of people that would agree with me fwiw.
[13:02:09] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[13:04:52] <taplar> i can read both, roberts looks simplier
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> lol it's his choice if he'd rather not learn the language.
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> not my problem.
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you today, taplar?
[13:07:27] <Whiskey> anyways robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[13:07:32] <taplar> pretty good.  reacing the end of one my cards i believe
[13:07:36] <taplar> *reaching
[13:07:42] <taplar> you?
[13:08:11] <robertmaxrees> dealing with some frustrating personal things.  work is insane right now.
[13:08:25] <taplar> sorry to hear that
[13:09:31] <NodeNoob> Guys, I am trying to retrieve multiple elements with the same class
[13:09:37] <NodeNoob> They are divs, any advice?
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> but i get my shipment of cigars today so i'm pretty excited about that.
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> NodeNoob $('.someclass');
[13:09:45] <robertmaxrees> done.
[13:09:52] <NodeNoob> will it return them in an array?
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> a jquery object, yes.
[13:10:04] <robertmaxrees> NodeNoob what do you wnat to do with them?
[13:10:09] <NodeNoob> thanks, so i will have to parse that?
[13:10:18] <robertmaxrees> NodeNoob what will you be doing with them?
[13:10:29] <NodeNoob> robertmaxrees: there are divs on a web page all with the same class with an attribute that i want to store
[13:10:41] <NodeNoob> but the attribute in every single one is different (href)
[13:10:49] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.map is what you want then.
[13:11:00] <NodeNoob> basically im scraping the cnn page through cheerio and trying to store all the news articles :P
[13:11:16] <NodeNoob> thanks robertmaxrees
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> to do what with them?
[13:11:29] <NodeNoob> im working on a project, live news website :)

[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> NodeNoob that's the basic idea.
[13:13:43] <bfig> robertmaxrees, do you recommend going with plain JqueryUI or should I look for plugins?
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> bfig no reason to add any other plugins.
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> jqui should be fine in this case.
[13:15:10] <bfig> I'm using a jqueryui 1.9.1, is this old?
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> ish, yeah.  that was released in 2012
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> we're on version 1.11.4 now.
[13:18:16] <NodeNoob> robertmaxrees: yo thanks man! if i need any more help, im going to come into this channel and spam you ;) ;)
[13:18:32] <robertmaxrees> the first one is free ;)
[13:19:36] <bfig> robertmaxrees, is it likely that I will run into bugs working with this? It's the one bundled with odoo :(
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> bfig i wouldn't worry about it too much.
[13:20:04] <robertmaxrees> worry about it if you run into issues.
[13:20:06] <bfig> ok, thanks for the help
[13:23:04] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: when i use it and its applays it change my other elements that are left to ID = null why?
[13:23:24] <Whiskey> its .this that be null
[13:23:56] <Whiskey> aaa its add a ID that is null
[13:24:13] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey show me.
[13:24:32] <Whiskey> see if i can do it in fiddle
[13:25:35] <Whiskey> ii don´t think it matter in my caser
[13:25:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:25:47] <nirakara> how to trigger a change event on an input even if there was no change
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey your statement that "ID = null" doesn't really make sense.
[13:26:18] <taplar> nirakara: trigger( 'change' ) is an option
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> want to make sure you understand what you're doing
[13:26:27] <robertmaxrees> nirakara why would you fire the event if nothing changed?
[13:27:08] <Whiskey> how the hell do you find the actiully code in fiddle?
[13:27:09] <Whiskey> haha
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey huh?
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> it's right there in the fiddle...?
[13:27:44] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, im relying on some code in a change event handler to update some information dynamically on the page the form is  in (a summary). if the user refreshes, he gets the correct initial values but the form is not initialised correctly and thus the summary shows as if the form is empty
[13:27:59] <Whiskey> yeh
[13:28:04] <bfig> robertmaxrees, do you have any input on the knockout part?
[13:28:05] <Whiskey> but i can´t find the html of what i coded
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> nirakara then abstract out the code and call it on pageload, too.
[13:28:08] <nirakara> changing one thing will cause everything to update correctly (i am listening to ("form.my_class :input").change(...)
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> bfig not really.
[13:28:10] <Whiskey> just parts from fiddle
[13:28:16] <bfig> ohh ok
[13:28:19] <bfig> well thanks anyway :)_
[13:28:33] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, you mean wrap it in a function?
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> nirakara correct.
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> abstract it out of an event handler and make it generic.
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> it's already a function fwiw.
[13:29:02] <Whiskey> i add it just in a html on my remove server 1 sec
[13:33:45] <chingyy938> would this work? https://jsfiddle.net/h877zj6L/ i'd like to execute a script every second
[13:34:01] <Whiskey> strange
[13:34:08] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: dosent happen in the example
[13:35:17] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 that makes a pretty weird assumption.
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> but theoretically.
[13:36:09] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, im very new to js. here is how I get the data to jsland + set intial state on some checkboxes/radios: https://dpaste.de/wx9N
[13:36:10] <Whiskey> why the hell does it add ID null
[13:36:13] <chingyy938> robertmaxrees: what does that mean xd
[13:36:16] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, the event handler is here: https://dpaste.de/XoM8
[13:36:40] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 you're running it every second, regardless of whether or not the last one was successful.
[13:36:51] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, your critique would be greatly appreciated
[13:36:56] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: hard when you can´t reprodiuce the problem
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey dunno what your problem is exactly, but okay.
[13:37:28] <robertmaxrees> nirakara you'd set the initial state server-side if possible.
[13:37:41] <nirakara> it is
[13:37:41] <Whiskey> that when it removes the elements in return !$(this).find("...........
[13:37:51] <Whiskey> the one thats left is added whit id "null"
[13:37:53] <nirakara> its like form ui initial state
[13:37:59] <Whiskey> and has no ID before
[13:38:04] <nirakara> for cases like page refresh
[13:38:22] <nirakara> so which styles where
[13:38:42] <nirakara> based on some state returned by server
[13:38:48] <Whiskey> nevermind something else does it
[13:39:08] <nirakara> but i get extra info in th ajax calls for some calculations
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> nirakara https://bpaste.net/show/2530a89e349a something like this.
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> now you can just call updateFormState() on document ready or whenever you need for things to get updated appropriately.
[13:40:33] <robertmaxrees> nirakara i'd run that through a linter fwiw.
[13:40:50] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, but now i still need to fire the change
[13:40:57] <robertmaxrees> nirakara why?
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> the change isn't the important part - the handler is.
[13:41:31] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, when i get initial state from the server the values on the page (in the summary) wont reflect the state of the form until a change is fired
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> what else is listening to the change event then?
[13:42:00] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, cant i just fire a change on some random input in my form on document(ready)? it's so much easier
[13:42:07] <robertmaxrees> nirakara that's a hack.
[13:42:08] <nirakara> nothing that i know of
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> that's proxying logic through the dom.
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> that's bad.
[13:42:24] <robertmaxrees> and i literally just gave you the solution you need.
[13:42:49] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, apologies. will try your solution out
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> like... https://bpaste.net/show/e339ed5e6eff
[13:44:04] <robertmaxrees> nirakara i left out the document ready because i assumed you knew what i meant by " now you can just call updateFormState() on document ready or whenever you need for things to get updated appropriately."
[13:44:39] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, my brainfart moment ^^^
[13:44:41] <nirakara> i didnt call it
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:45:26] <robertmaxrees> there are other issues with that code.
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> but start there.
[13:48:39] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know what this error means https://travis-ci.org/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/builds/89154754#L969 means
[13:48:51] <rindolf> Hi all.
[13:49:16] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque where's the relevant code?
[13:50:18] <robertmaxrees> ah, https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/issues/1564
[13:50:23] <robertmaxrees> issue is jsdoc it looks like.
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jscs-dev/jscs-jsdoc/issues/127 aaaaah
[13:52:25] <abikan> I'm looking for a simple templating engine; anyone knows where a good place to start is?!? :)
[13:52:38] <robertmaxrees> abikan underscore.
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> microtemplates
[13:52:45] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: i think my relevant code is https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/7f02902ceeb7486fcbd62038bb0e77593981c5c6/src/js/html_form_delegator.js#L25
[13:52:54] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque look at the last link i shot out.
[13:52:58] <jeffreylevesque> i'm not sure how I can change it to pass the jscs lint
[13:53:06] <abikan> yey! that was fast. Thanks a bunch. Will check out!
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque need to add @param {Object} event - the event object
[13:54:15] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: am i not supposed to have `@param {object} event.preventDefault`
[13:54:25] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, i had a variable declared at the scope of the read() function called fee_structure. it is now undefined inside this function. how do i pass a variable into this function when it is passed by reference to the change hander?
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> according to the page i linked you, you need to first specify the event object.
[13:54:32] <jeffreylevesque> or am i supposed to have `@param {object} event` before `@param {object} event.preventDefault`
[13:54:34] <nirakara> *read() = ready()
[13:54:54] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque basically.
[13:54:57] <django_> hey all :)
[13:55:01] <jeffreylevesque> thank you!
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> nirakara code again with context?
[13:55:03] <django_> how do i access a specific li: http://jsfiddle.net/sbmtk21q/1/
[13:55:22] <robertmaxrees> django_ what is your criteria?
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> which LI do you want?
[13:55:33] <django_> robertmaxrees: any..pass it a number
[13:55:40] <django_> lets say i had 50
[13:55:42] <django_> i wanna get 26
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:55:53] <django_> is that possible?
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> what significance is number 26?
[13:56:03] <robertmaxrees> yes, it's possible, but that sounds gross.
[13:56:36] <robertmaxrees> .eq() is the method for that.
[13:56:44] <robertmaxrees> but again, you want to avoid doing that and find something more concrete.
[13:56:49] <django_> robertmaxrees: $('ul li b') that gives me the list of b
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> django_ right, what's the significance of, say, the 26th li in a list of 50 of them?
[13:57:21] <django_> http://jsfiddle.net/sbmtk21q/2/
[13:57:26] <django_> bro i just wanna access it
[13:57:29] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, https://dpaste.de/0QuX#L2,84,85,103
[13:57:36] <robertmaxrees> then i answered your question "bro" ;)
[13:57:37] <robertmaxrees> .eq()
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> nirakara so what here is broken?
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> you said something about a global var?
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> also - you don't wait for your ajax calls to finish, so your code will fire before those complete.
[14:01:37] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, that's probably the problem
[14:01:54] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, so i need to put this all inside success methods of ajax also?
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:02:01] <robertmaxrees> you want deferrends.
[14:02:18] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, my head can grow quite big but please dont make it explode
[14:02:26] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the basic idea.
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/5928ec005924
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> so basically I added a variable declaration for each ajax call and then did $.when(getFeeStructure, getvendorSpecs).done(updateFormState);
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> fwiw using global vars to shuffle around data like that is generally a bad idea.
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> but work on getting your head around the async part first before tackling that.
[14:11:07] <nirakara> thanks robertmaxrees, will take a look
[14:16:39] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: i made the suggested changes and now getting "Expected `event,` but got `event`" - https://travis-ci.org/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/builds/89286824#L918
[14:16:49] <jeffreylevesque> this doesn't make sense to me :(
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque i'm actually not entirely familiar with jcsc or whatever
[14:17:07] <robertmaxrees> i just searched google.
[14:24:16] <nirakara> robertmaxrees, wow, when is cool
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> nirakara *deferreds
[14:24:26] <robertmaxrees> and promises.
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> good reading material.
[14:24:35] <nirakara> which one is this technique
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> both ;)
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> they're interrelated.
[14:24:50] <nirakara> robertmaxrees im reading javascript for webdevelopers but its boring as hell
[14:25:08] <nirakara> im at classes at the moment and its my third time through this chapter
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> classes in js are a joke partially because they don't truly exist.
[14:25:45] <nirakara> now i hear es6 ads true classes?
[14:25:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:25:56] <robertmaxrees> just syntactic sugar over prototypes.
[14:26:07] <nirakara> i had a chuckle.
[14:26:28] <nirakara> im trying to get into reactjs but jquery solves my problems now :)
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> react is awesome.
[14:39:21] <taplar> mmm, empty card lane.  time to get a kitkat
[14:46:48] <chingyy938> https://jsfiddle.net/gxcc157p/ doesn't appear to be working, could someone help please
[14:49:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any jquery use in there,
[14:49:26] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript would be a better place.
[14:54:39] <Kronuz> how come  element.on('shown', ...) is not called when element.trigger('shown.bs.tab') is triggered?
[14:55:21] <Kronuz> I thought on('shown') would capture any of those events :/
[14:55:43] <robhol> ... why would you assume that?
[14:55:45] <Kronuz> is there no way of doing that? do I have to specify the whole event name in the on() ?
[14:55:50] <Kronuz> because
[14:56:14] <robertmaxrees> Kronuz that's not how event namespacing works.
[14:56:18] <Kronuz> I thought namespaces where optional, like when using on('click')
[14:56:45] <Kronuz> robertmaxrees, so there's no way to capture all events starting with "shown" with an on()?
[14:56:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:56:59] <Kronuz> ok
[14:57:07] <Kronuz> I got that wrong for a long time then :P
[14:58:20] <romtim> Hello, what is the best way to fetch content from a specified url? For example, once a person presses a button, it shows dynamic content that was fetched from a custom url.
[14:59:12] <romtim> In my case, it submits a custom url structure to a hosted script, which in return, based on the custom url submitted, provides a value in return, which is then used in the page
[14:59:23] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax()
[14:59:39] <romtim> Is it possible to have an ajax call in an ajax call in that case?
[14:59:42] <romtim> And thanks!
[15:00:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean do one after one has completed?
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> romtim
[15:02:18] <romtim> Well all my code is executed in an ajax call, so I'm adding another ajax call inside of that ajax call to fetch the data
[15:02:22] <romtim> and I'm hoping that it will work :)
[15:02:33] <robertmaxrees> "ajax call inside of that ajax call" doesn't make any sense.
[15:02:48] <robertmaxrees> you can't put an ajax call in an ajax call - do you mean in the .done() callback?
[15:02:52] <romtim> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10089580
[15:02:56] <romtim> Thats what I found
[15:03:12] <robertmaxrees> so you want to do one call after another has completed.
[15:03:24] <romtim> I guess so.
[15:03:43] <robertmaxrees> that's what success is - it's a callback for when the ajax call has successfully completed.
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> do yours need to actually happen in a given order?
[15:03:55] <romtim> Oh, ok, makes sense now. In that case yes
[15:04:39] <romtim> Well the page is loaded through the initial ajax call, and in that code i need to add another ajax call, so I was just worried whether that would be possible
[15:04:47] <romtim> And, apparently that can be done, so I'm working on it now
[15:05:00] <robertmaxrees> lol does the second call rely on the first being done?
[15:05:05] <robertmaxrees> or could you run them in parallel?
[15:05:17] <romtim> Well the whole code is inside the first ajax call
[15:05:22] <romtim> It probably wont work outside
[15:05:31] <romtim> since its relied on the results
[15:05:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what i've been asking.
[15:05:38] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:13:28] <romtim> Ok, im getting a No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header error.. Is there a way to have an ajax call to an external url?
[15:13:54] <robertmaxrees> you cannot fix that unless you control the remote server.
[15:14:35] <robertmaxrees> or your code has to be on the same port, prototcol, and domain.
[15:14:38] <romtim> I do control both servers, one of them is mine (where the url of the ajax call is called), and the other is the client's website, where the script will be
[15:14:54] <robertmaxrees> so you're running into something called CORS.
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> you can explicitly allow that domain to acces the server.
[15:15:31] <romtim> Oh, ok, I will dig deeper into that, thank you!
[15:38:27] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: I'm going to need you to go ahead and legally change your name so I don't get pinged by mistake anymore ;)
[15:38:33] <robertmaxrees> hah

[16:01:41] <N00bie_> I have a section that takes up 100vh.  I'm trying to add a button to scroll down to the section below.  Can anyone help me with this?
[16:03:37] <romtim> Well, add a hook
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> click event handler.
[16:04:16] <N00bie_> I have that part added.  It's the part of telling it how far to scroll down.
[16:04:43] <robertmaxrees> see which container the link is inside of, get its index, then get that index + 1 for the next one.
[16:07:52] <N00bie_> I tried to console log this but it's not writing anything out.  Is my syntax wrong? console.log($('#Hero').index()+1);
[16:08:07] <robertmaxrees> you can only have one item with that ID
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> and http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9uhpgopv/
[16:08:23] <N00bie_> There is only one div with that id.
[16:08:31] <robertmaxrees> yw
[16:08:38] <robertmaxrees> i have an appointment.  see y'all leter.
[16:08:40] <robertmaxrees> *later
[16:12:33] <Side_FX> My jquery is so-so, but not very advanced, but I am trying to fix a script which isn't working, is there anything wrong with this code:  var counthotspots =  holder.parent('.dopelessrotate').find('.sethotspot').length;
[16:13:08] <Side_FX> From what I can tell it should be pulling all the objects with class .sethotspot inside of the object with the class dopelessrotate but it has a length of 0
[16:14:27] <shoky> Side_FX: then it's not finding anything.  might wanna try .closest instead of .parent
[16:16:24] <Side_FX> Now I get undefined
[16:16:52] <Side_FX> 0 actually...
[16:17:35] <shoky> check each part separately..   holder.length,  holder.closest('.dopelessrotate').length,   etc
[16:17:57] <Side_FX> Oh I found the problem, the code I downloaded had things that looked like ' but weren't
[16:27:31] <ul71m0> hi im using this http://pastie.org/10529871 to scroll to top of my div, but the problem is i have fixed navbar and i want to offset scroll for 80px down, but not sure where to add those 80px
[16:32:12] <libracious> $('msg').append('<img src="some_source">'); when i do this it works fine but the image is not loaded
[16:32:22] <libracious> can any 1 help me
[16:33:18] <Side_FX> What is msg?
[16:34:21] <libracious> Side_FX:  $('.msg').append('<img src="some_source">');  its a class
[16:35:58] <Side_FX> I think you need double quotes fo rthe class selector
[16:37:06] <shoky> you don't
[16:37:23] <libracious> it is appending just fine but the image is not loaded.
[16:37:50] <libracious> and yes double quotes r not required
[16:39:08] <NoiseEee> libracious: i guess one can assume the path is incorrect then?
[16:39:21] <NoiseEee> (path to the image that is)
[16:39:34] <libracious> no when i open the image directly it works
[16:39:50] <NoiseEee> what does "open the image directly" mean?
[16:40:06] <NoiseEee> if the image isn't loading, its because the path is incorrect
[16:40:11] <NoiseEee> try an absolute path?
[16:40:17] <libracious> but when i click some button that gets the image path from server and appends it it doesnt works
[16:40:41] <NoiseEee> what does "open the image directly" mean?
[16:40:54] <libracious> directly means on new tab i go directly on the source
[16:41:19] <NoiseEee> libracious: try making a fiddle, but if you see the <img> element and no image, the path is wrong. check it out in your dev console.
[16:41:52] <libracious> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/88p1D6bs/
[16:42:03] <libracious> this is the code that is fired
[16:42:58] <libracious> this is appended everything works fine but the image is not loaded
[16:49:47] <fire8431> I've got a .getJSON request, and the done event doesn't seem to be firing. here's the code: http://pastebin.com/VED1ymN2 can anyone tell me what's wrong?
[16:50:28] <fire8431> i have verified that it is loading the correct url with the correct parameters, and is getting a json response.
[16:50:59] <NoiseEee> libracious: i don't know how many times I can say it.
[16:51:50] <NoiseEee> libracious: perhaps the src you need starts with  "/api/image/"  not "api/image",  only you know
[16:54:46] <fire8431> ???
[16:55:25] <libracious> NoiseEee:  yes that was the problm
[16:55:30] <libracious> thnx
[16:56:11] <NoiseEee> fire8431: that seems like it should be fine, you sure thats the code w/ the issue?
[16:56:41] <NoiseEee> fire8431: are you getting a 200 response?
[16:56:46] <fire8431> yes it runs, i get the email alert in the console.
[16:57:26] <fire8431> i get a 200 reponse.
[16:58:16] <NoiseEee> fire8431: weird
[16:58:43] <fire8431> isn't there a way to use the built in success function.. i'm just not sure how i put that in the getJSON paramaters
[16:59:24] <fire8431> would i just change the ending to }, function(json) { ... });
[17:51:07] <HowardwLo> hello! i’m doing scroll tracking on a list of elements, is there a quick jquery function that can tell me which section is currently on screen?
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:51:25] <HowardwLo> ah thought so
[17:52:11] <HowardwLo> i guess i’ll have to calculate the offset, and log that?
[17:52:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:52:58] <robertmaxrees> gotta do it manually.
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> make sure you debounce and store selectors in vars beforehand.
[17:53:44] <HowardwLo> debounce?
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> err, debounce or throttle, rather.
[17:54:09] <robertmaxrees> wait until the scroll is done or limit how often the handler fires.
[17:54:17] <HowardwLo> oh
[17:54:26] <HowardwLo> critical? or good to have?
[17:54:36] <robertmaxrees> pretty major.
[17:55:13] <robertmaxrees> one of the few cases where you need to consider the perf implications up front.
[18:34:46] <s2013> hi anyone good with select2 ? i am sending a data that is an array like [ { id: 123, text: "some text" }, ...] however wheenver i select something and i submit it, it submits the id rather than the text. cant seem to figure out how to send the text
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[18:37:49] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/69a9a58812faf81b063d robertmaxrees
[18:38:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:39:32] <robertmaxrees> what's with the invalid data?
[18:39:43] <s2013> what do you mean invalid data
[18:39:51] <robertmaxrees> [{"id":1,"text":"default"},,{"id":75,"text":"standard"}]
[18:39:55] <robertmaxrees> there's a blank object in there.
[18:39:58] <robertmaxrees> kind of weir.d
[18:40:04] <s2013> oh typo
[18:40:05] <s2013> one sec
[18:40:15] <s2013> updated
[18:40:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kv4hr6cq/2/
[18:40:48] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue here?
[18:41:21] <s2013> issue is when i submit the form in the parameters it send the id rather than the text
[18:41:34] <robertmaxrees> err, that's pretty normal.  the ID would be the value.
[18:41:48] <s2013> yeah i understand thats the default
[18:41:53] <s2013> how do i make it so the value is the text
[18:41:54] <s2013> not the id
[18:42:21] <s2013> because the id / text is coming straight from the db.. i can change it so the json that its requesting is changed
[18:42:24] <s2013> but wondering if there is a dif way
[18:42:32] <s2013> otherwise ill have id/text thats identical
[18:43:29] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:44:15] <s2013> thanks
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> i can't see anything in the docs.
[18:44:23] <robertmaxrees> doesn't mean it's not there.
[18:44:31] <s2013> yeah i tried searching for it for a while
[18:44:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd modify your backend to pump the data out in the right form,at.
[18:44:47] <s2013> robertmaxrees well in that case both text / id would be identical
[18:44:51] <s2013> thats my other solution
[18:44:57] <s2013> but i was wondering if there was another way to do it, if not its ok
[18:44:59] <robertmaxrees> which looks like the right way to do that.
[18:45:10] <robertmaxrees> normally you wouldn't do that.
[18:45:15] <robertmaxrees> you'd have a uniqueid as the id column.
[18:45:25] <robertmaxrees> since trust that input is A Bad Idea™
[18:45:27] <s2013> well what bout a search field
[18:45:37] <s2013> makes sense for it to submit the keyword someone searches for right
[18:45:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:46:01] <robertmaxrees> we're talking about a dropdown
[18:46:36] <robertmaxrees> but any input should be sanitized.
[18:47:36] <robertmaxrees> an end user can modify the form freely and submit whatever they way.
[18:47:38] <robertmaxrees> *want
[18:48:44] <chingyy938> Hi guys, could someone check why it wont load GBTC please :) thx https://jsfiddle.net/2ufg19n4/
[18:49:08] <robertmaxrees> chingyy938 open your console.
[18:49:18] <chingyy938> there are no errors xd
[18:49:24] <robertmaxrees> yes there are.
[18:49:29] <chingyy938> oh yea my bad
[18:49:43] <robertmaxrees> fix that and you'll be fine.
[18:49:55] <chingyy938> Cannot read property 'quote' of null
[18:49:57] <chingyy938> this one?
[18:50:01] <robertmaxrees> si.
[19:53:56] <chingyy938> https://gbtc.us
[19:54:32] <chingyy938> anyone know how i can convert a string to another currency with jquery or js?
[19:54:45] <robertmaxrees> do it server side.
[19:55:09] <Cthulhux`> chingyy938, yes, you can
[19:55:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, http://openexchangerates.github.io/money.js/
[19:55:17] <Cthulhux`> i actually wrote a calculator which does it
[19:55:18] <Cthulhux`> :-)
[19:55:25] <robertmaxrees> Cthulhux` what was your data source?
[19:55:25] <Cthulhux`> client-side, that is
[19:56:00] <Cthulhux`> robertmaxrees, the money.js script but mirrored on my server so i can share it for free - they restrict api access to a certain number per day
[19:56:09] <chingyy938> thx
[19:56:20] <chingyy938> so my site https://gbtc.us
[19:56:22] <Cthulhux`> my server mirrors the currency database once a day and converts it into proper JSON
[19:56:25] <Cthulhux`> just in case
[19:56:27] <chingyy938> if you wait for the USD to load
[19:56:31] <Cthulhux`> (their JSON is broken)
[19:56:36] <chingyy938> i just want to grab that usd, and e.g. change it to GBP
[19:57:05] <chingyy938> ill figure it out thx
[19:57:07] <Cthulhux`> chingyy938, http://i.imgur.com/Qc31D1b.png
[19:57:08] <Cthulhux`> :-D
[19:57:12] <Cthulhux`> first! first!
[19:57:32] <chingyy938> cthulhux what did you use :P
[19:57:42] <robertmaxrees> the thing i linked you.
[19:57:45] <chingyy938> oh
[19:57:48] <Cthulhux`> chingyy938, emacs...
[19:57:49] <Cthulhux`> :D
[19:57:55] <Cthulhux`> yes, and some more things
[19:58:05] <Cthulhux`> like a colored input field
[19:58:14] <robertmaxrees> *eyeroll*
[19:58:15] <Cthulhux`> and, in theory, a unit calculator
[19:58:17] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of a given ;)
[19:58:18] <Cthulhux`> hja!
[19:58:37] <chingyy938> i know like 0 on javascript or jquery, i'll hire a freelancer to implement
[19:58:38] <chingyy938> xd
[19:58:55] <chingyy938> i spent all day asking for freebie help in here and built this https://gbtc.us/
[19:58:57] <chingyy938> xd
[19:59:03] <chingyy938> parsing data and stuff
[19:59:03] <Cthulhux`> now when ceramic finally works with CCL, i'll wrap my calculator into an executable and share it for free
[19:59:10] <Cthulhux`> then you can just have it, chingyy938 :P
[19:59:23] <robertmaxrees> Cthulhux` looks like he really wants to make a site to buy/sell things.
[19:59:30] <robertmaxrees> so the executable would be moot at that point.
[19:59:37] <chingyy938> exe.mp3?
[19:59:47] <Cthulhux`> mp3? :o
[19:59:59] <chingyy938> lol ratting days are over
[20:00:10] <Cthulhux`> robertmaxrees, one of the problems with such wrappers is that you can always extract the original code
[20:00:17] <Cthulhux`> so he could still use it
[20:00:18] <Cthulhux`> sadly :D
[20:00:28] <robertmaxrees> Cthulhux` grats?
[20:00:31] <chingyy938> would you accept an executable from a stranger?
[20:00:53] <Cthulhux`> depends. who made your IRC client?
[20:01:09] <chingyy938> freenode webchat
[20:01:24] <Cthulhux`> and who made the browser you run it in?
[20:01:31] <chingyy938> google
[20:01:32] <Cthulhux`> a friend of yours or a stranger?
[20:01:34] <Cthulhux`> see?
[20:01:35] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[20:01:36] <Cthulhux`> ;-)
[20:01:40] <robertmaxrees> this is the most bizarre conversation ever.
[20:01:50] <chingyy938> conservation??
[20:01:51] <chingyy938> lol
[20:01:58] <Cthulhux`> robertmaxrees, welcome to the internet.
[20:02:07] <robertmaxrees> Cthulhux` been here for a while mano ;)
[20:02:12] <Cthulhux`> :P
[20:05:04] <Cthulhux`> chingyy938: http://paste2.org/CakaZbCB line 32 to 41 could be interesting to you, that's my "pass the input text to the currency converter from money.js" code
[20:05:10] <Cthulhux`> any more questions?
[20:05:24] <Cthulhux`> (except "why is your code so ugly?")
[20:06:00] <robertmaxrees> why hand over the answer so readily when the point is to teach how to fix?
[20:06:03] <robertmaxrees> *fish
[20:06:33] <Cthulhux`> because many people, including me, better understand how code works by reading code
[20:06:43] <chingyy938> thanks
[20:06:49] <chingyy938> i've learnt alot by being spoon fed today
[20:06:52] <Cthulhux`> as many people, including me, follow the "learning by doing" aspect
[20:06:53] <Cthulhux`> :-)
[20:06:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not doing.
[20:07:00] <robertmaxrees> that's copy/pasting.
[20:07:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:07:18] <Cthulhux`> i'm sure chingyy938 will have to adjust my code to fit his needs
[20:07:24] <Cthulhux`> it doesn't even fill a textbox..
[20:07:26] <Cthulhux`> ;-)
[20:07:29] <robertmaxrees> without understanding what it's actually doing
[20:07:34] <robertmaxrees> BUT WHAT WOULD I KNOW, 'EH?
[20:07:45] <Cthulhux`> well, he'll have to.
[20:08:05] <Cthulhux`> basically, he'll need to set up fx() first...
[20:08:06] <robertmaxrees> most people just tweak until it works without knowing what they're tweaking.  that's my argument.
[20:08:07] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[20:08:32] <Cthulhux`> i have the code here and i wanted to brag with it
[20:08:34] <Cthulhux`> that's all.
[20:08:36] <Cthulhux`> :o)
[20:08:46] <robertmaxrees> which is directly against the purpose of the channel ;)
[20:08:48] <robertmaxrees> but okie.
[20:09:02] <Cthulhux`> the purpose is "talk about your code",  i thought?
[20:09:09] <robertmaxrees> it's a support channel.
[20:09:20] <robertmaxrees> largely.
[20:09:26] <Cthulhux`> that's not mentioned anywhere.
[20:09:50] <Cthulhux`> do you expect people to understand the jQuery code before you advise them to use jQuery?
[20:10:00] <Cthulhux`> if not, why doesn't that apply to my code? :-)
[20:10:02] <robertmaxrees> you know exactly what i meant.
[20:10:09] <robertmaxrees> and the implication is that it's a support channel.
[20:10:18] <robertmaxrees> but feel free to be excessively pedantic :)
[20:10:29] <Cthulhux`> girls love me for that.
[20:10:32] <Cthulhux`> i hope...
[20:10:56] <robertmaxrees> eeehh.
[20:10:57] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[20:22:59] <chingyy938> do you guys know how to remove that bit of text in the corner of the line graph, it doesn't have an id or class or parent div https://gbtc.us/
[20:23:20] <robertmaxrees> the "Highcharts.com" attribution?
[20:23:24] <chingyy938> yes
[20:23:37] <robertmaxrees> isn't that supposed to be there unless you pay for it?
[20:23:43] <chingyy938> its freeware
[20:24:20] <robertmaxrees> https://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts.html
[20:24:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:24:26] <robertmaxrees> need to pay to get rid of the attribution.
[20:24:42] <cjbaezilla> hello guys, how can i get the "this" parameters of a element?, without "this", i mean, i have a input type file and a button, when i press the button i need to retrieve the "this" of the input
[20:24:51] <robertmaxrees> cjbaezilla make a fiddle.
[20:25:21] <cjbaezilla> but i dont know how to retrieve that value
[20:25:38] <cjbaezilla> in the document click function
[20:25:39] <robertmaxrees> cjbaezilla your question isn't making sense so i want to make sure i understand it.
[20:25:53] <robertmaxrees> because you're referring to "the "this" of the input" which doesn't make sense.
[20:26:32] <cjbaezilla> so i can only refer to "this" from the same object?, there is no way that i can get that value?
[20:26:49] <robertmaxrees> cjbaezilla i don't understand what you're trying to say.
[20:26:55] <cjbaezilla> lol
[20:26:57] <robertmaxrees> "this" is basically the invocation context.
[20:27:02] <taplar> 'this' is a contextual variable that can reference the context.  it doesn't 'belong' to an element
[20:27:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery sets the context to the element that, for instance, emitted the event.
[20:27:32] <cjbaezilla> i have and input and a button, when i press the button, how can i get the "this" of the input?
[20:27:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[20:27:44] <cjbaezilla> ok that was my question
[20:27:45] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[20:27:47] <cjbaezilla> thank you :P
[20:28:05] <robertmaxrees> you can use https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[20:28:11] <robertmaxrees> but I'd avoid that if possibole.
[20:28:17] <robertmaxrees> and there's no "this of the input"
[20:28:26] <taplar> what are you planning on doing with the 'this'?
[20:28:36] <robertmaxrees> the "this" is a product of using the function - it "belongs" to whatever invoked it.
[20:28:59] <cjbaezilla> need to upload a file depending on the input
[20:29:12] <robertmaxrees> then select the input.
[20:29:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to modify context of the function.
[20:29:35] <cjbaezilla> so i was doing it on the change function, that way i can access the "this" of the input, but now i need to implement a button for the action
[20:29:56] <robertmaxrees> again - there's no "this of the input" :)
[20:30:06] <robertmaxrees> either way, abstract out and explicitly select the input.
[20:30:15] <cjbaezilla> i guess my english is not very good looking
[20:30:42] <robertmaxrees> just clarifying.
[20:33:23] <chingyy938> what does             enabled: !0, mean?
[20:33:32] <taplar> lol
[20:33:40] <taplar> a round about way of setting it to true
[20:33:53] <chingyy938> how would i set it to false? XD
[20:33:58] <taplar> enabled: false
[20:34:01] <chingyy938> ty
[20:34:14] <taplar> if you can change that !0 to true, go for it
[20:34:26] <chingyy938> yay
[20:34:28] <chingyy938> done :D
[21:04:52] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I need a bit of help with loops and populating fields from other fields. http://jsfiddle.net/rar5h4hj/ I have applicants that can have multiple residences. If their spouses are added, I need to autofill the spouse's residence fields with the same values as the applciant. The number of residences can vary so I'll need to loop through them. I just don't know how to match first for first, second for second, etc.
[21:06:57] <ashgotti> I'm thinking .map() maybe the way to do it but not sure how to connect the two sets of addreses
[21:07:04] <taplar> so the first applicant residence relates to the first spouse residence?
[21:08:39] <ashgotti> taplar: I have an option for the user that's called "same address' that will trigger the autopopulation of the spouse's fields.
[21:09:20] <taplar> but how are they related?
[21:11:09] <ashgotti> Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. If the user selects "same address", the spouse's address should populate from the applicant's address: A.1 -> S.1, A.2 -> S.2
[21:11:28] <taplar> yeah, that's what i was asking from the first question
[21:11:34] <taplar> so they are related by order
[21:11:48] <ashgotti> Yes, the order will match
[21:12:08] <ashgotti> I already have hte function that will create the spouse's X addresses based on the applicant's addresses. Now I just need to fill them.
[21:12:19] <ashgotti> Using .map() I can get the index and values of the fields.
[21:13:00] <taplar> ok, so one way to do that is to give each applicant area a common parent class and the same to the spouse areas
[21:13:34] <ashgotti> But how do I do the mapping from the first address for applicant to the first address for spouse and so on?
[21:13:37] <taplar> then when you choose your auto populate for an area, you can get it's index in that collection and then use that to get the related element in the other collection
[21:15:25] <ashgotti> This is what I have as far as mapping: http://jsfiddle.net/rar5h4hj/1/
[21:17:11] <ashgotti> With that I can get address[0] and the values but I don't know how to do address[0] -> spouseAddress[0]. Do I create another map within my first for spouseAddress[0]?
[21:20:53] <taplar> super small example of the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/41ja5kr5/
[21:23:29] <ashgotti> Great, thanks! Now I can google index() and eq(), they look very useful.
[21:24:14] <taplar> eq() will give you a single element from a found jquery collection, that is still a jquery object
[21:24:36] <taplar> so if you did $('div').eq(2), that would give you the third div on the page
[21:24:41] <ashgotti> So step 1 get the index of the applicant's address then populate the spouse's address of the same index using eq()?
[21:25:02] <ashgotti> great! So I can do a loop because I have one button that should populate all the fields
[21:25:15] <taplar> you wouldn't really need a loop
[21:25:30] <taplar> unless your doing some sort of loop to go through the children inputs
[21:25:37] <ashgotti> I am
[21:25:41] <taplar> ah, alright
[21:26:23] <ashgotti> foreach address set, street1B = street1A, city1B = city1B, street2B = street2A
[21:26:41] <taplar> oh
[21:26:52] <taplar> so the populate is a global button to do the copy for each pair?
[21:26:57] <ashgotti> that's right
[21:27:04] <taplar> gotcha, i misunderstood that, heh
[21:27:09] <ashgotti> and there maybe only one address or 10
[21:27:14] <ashgotti> it's a variable number
[21:27:27] <ashgotti> btw, I really appreciate the help with this!
[21:27:31] <taplar> np
[21:27:59] <taplar> in that case ...
[21:29:35] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/41ja5kr5/1/
[21:29:48] <taplar> something like the commented out area would probably be more appropriate
[21:30:05] <ashgotti> taplar++
[21:30:24] <ashgotti> That's what I was thinking. Thanks again!
[22:04:54] <cjbaezilla> is there a way to send a file with jquery and .ajax?
[22:05:12] <cjbaezilla> googlying for like 1,5 hours...
[22:12:21] <kevireilly> cjbaezilla: sure, first result of "jquery file upload" produces this example https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[22:13:18] <cjbaezilla> well i dont really need that...what im looking for is how to do that, because i've got an input with a file, and i need to post it
[22:13:24] <cjbaezilla> trying everything lol
[22:16:38] <cjbaezilla> https://jsfiddle.net/zmmvrdmq/
[22:17:24] <cjbaezilla> i've tried FormData and nothing, the post comes empty
[22:24:28] <Qiller> Hi friends, can i group two videos and save result using jquery or html5?
[22:40:25] <kevireilly> cjbaezilla: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/basic-plus.html#L148
