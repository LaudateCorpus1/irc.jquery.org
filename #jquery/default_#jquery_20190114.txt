[04:24:49] <Massprog> hi I have problem with deleting added element with jquery here is link to my code https://jsfiddle.net/Masoud0X0/d09xkb51/3/
[04:25:26] <Cork> none of those are delegates
[04:26:38] <Cork> Massprog: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[04:27:15] <Massprog> Cork, Thanks
[05:12:21] <test> hi
[05:12:34] <test> test
[05:16:49] <Massprog> Cork, I added preventDefault but still not working
[05:17:06] <Cork> Massprog: preventDefault has nothing to do with it
[05:22:59] <Massprog> Cork, sorry for asking twice now that I payed more attention I understood thanks again
[05:23:22] <Cork> Massprog: np
[05:23:54] <Cork> Massprog: sorry for beeing a bit short, but i'm debuggin an annoying problem that is taking my focus
[06:02:45] <Massprog> Cork, you were polite and that's enough ;)
[06:03:42] <Massprog> Cork, and good luck with debugging
[06:56:15] <paule32> hello
[06:56:29] <paule32> have problem with mousemove, and cursor
[06:56:31] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/0M5105C
[06:56:44] <paule32> i have a rectangle with 4 sizer rects
[06:57:27] <paule32> when i move on the left/top sizer rect, the mouse cursor change to pointer
[06:57:39] <paule32> line 19
[06:58:14] <paule32> then, when i click somewhere, the mousemove event don't fired
[06:58:46] <Cork> you mean when you move with the left button down?
[06:58:55] <paule32> because unbind in line 67
[06:59:34] <paule32> but, when i comment this line, the rectangle will move around the "canvas", and no one mouseup comes
[06:59:57] <paule32> so, the rectangle follows the mouse and is draw on position x,y
[07:00:10] <paule32> how can i fix these issue
[07:00:34] <Cork> har to say without any html, but it most likely cause another element is above the element you want to get the event from
[07:00:54] <Cork> i would recommend reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[07:03:45] <FilipNortic> and/or refactoring down the long blocks to smaller functions
[07:04:50] <FilipNortic> y1 might be undefined but har to tell from this mess...
[07:05:06] <paule32> you can see the issue at: https://www.kallup.solutions/
[07:05:28] <paule32> follow the source by browser (start.js)
[07:06:57] <FilipNortic> you never intiate y1 with a var call, but that might be ok now?
[07:07:10] <FilipNortic> don't remember how that is handled
[07:08:24] <FilipNortic> paule32:  and unbind is an old command the new one is off
[07:09:22] <paule32> how can i made the paste code better?
[07:10:23] <paule32> notice: it differs a little bit from the website server, because i develop local, and push changes later on
[07:12:48] <FilipNortic> paule32:  if none of what i said helped then you might need to do what cork said an reproduce the error in a fiddle, or simillar
[07:19:54] <FilipNortic> paule32: but this much I can say. Defining variables inside an init function for your events and then sharing thoose varibles between the events seems a bit strange
[07:20:13] <FilipNortic> can even begin to figure out how the scope would work
[07:41:39] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/ptwj5rkd/8/
[07:41:52] <paule32> there must be a bug
[07:42:19] <paule32> when all is done, 2 rectangles should be shown
[07:42:24] <paule32> 1x red
[07:42:32] <paule32> 1x blue
[07:42:49] <paule32> ehm 1x green
[08:26:55] <chawixxx> Hi people! Do you know a way or a plugin to implement a dynamic form with text fields only and hierarchy? The purpose is to create many different associative arrays to insert in a mongo db
[09:01:39] <paule32> sorry, disconnect
[09:01:44] <paule32> give it feedback to my last message?
[11:55:42] <puchacz> hi, what's the "recommended" library for tree editing, like directories? I realise that it is a lame and broad question :-)
[11:56:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that there is one.
[11:56:20] <puchacz> I would like something that is a library, not a framework and can handle tens of thousands of nodes, not sure how lazy loading etc. should be organised
[11:57:18] <puchacz> something like in eclipse or intellij, it has a tree showing structure of current project
[11:57:47] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[11:58:18] <puchacz> I built buboflash.eu - people create flashcards from websites and PDFs
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> what about somethinmg like https://www.jstree.com/?
[11:58:25] <puchacz> but they lack organisation
[11:58:39] <puchacz> you can only search through them, you cannot organise them into - well - trees
[11:59:26] <puchacz> if I had trees, the "addresses" would double as URLs
[12:00:36] <puchacz> robertmaxrees: have you used it?
[12:00:40] <puchacz> jstree?
[12:01:27] <robertmaxrees> i haven't.
[12:01:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't really use that kind of UI since it's not really common for websites.
[12:03:30] <puchacz> true. I don't want buboflash to evolve into something like sencha.com
[12:03:49] <puchacz> I use bootstrap 3 for styling.
[12:04:10] <puchacz> having said that, I will want in the future spreadsheet like editability for many flashcards at once
[12:07:11] <bestdesign> bootstrap is too generic
[12:07:24] <bestdesign> is like just another bootstrap site
[12:08:17] <puchacz> bestdesign: so says my wife.... however it is so deeply ingrained into buboflash now, that I will not touch it for a while
[12:08:49] <puchacz> what I meant is I don't want to follow sencha's philosophy of making a website look and behave like desktop
[12:09:00] <bestdesign> puchacz your wife tell a good thing and same my opinion from a copy paste style sheet a web page will be just generic one
[12:09:01] <puchacz> and I don't want sencha's design of "framework" as opposed to library
[12:09:21] <bestdesign> :)
[12:09:45] <puchacz> bestdesign: I will improve it at some point for sure :) but I hardwired it too much into the code, so it will take a lot of effort
[12:10:04] <puchacz> I definitely want tree and then excel like tables before redesigning looks
[12:10:33] <bestdesign> buboflash.eu
[12:10:33] <bestdesign> ?
[12:11:45] <bestdesign>   >-- this in source code is not valid many lines
[12:12:10] <bestdesign> </script
[12:12:10] <puchacz> buboflash.eu, yes
[12:12:14] <puchacz> what is not valid?
[12:12:14] <bestdesign> is </script>
[12:12:20] <bestdesign> > chars
[12:12:35] <puchacz> chrome console does not show any errors....
[12:12:37] <bestdesign> write this one line all
[12:12:40] <bestdesign> its look ugly
[12:12:45] <bestdesign> is about html css
[12:12:46] <bestdesign> not js
[12:13:09] <puchacz> ah, you mean splitting tags by newline inside tag names?
[12:13:10] <bestdesign> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/b6b09ee71f17b79c68a61664510085f4/pasted.txt
[12:13:15] <bestdesign> for example
[12:13:23] <bestdesign> </script> and <script>
[12:13:26] <bestdesign> not with break line
[12:13:34] <puchacz> autogenerated, I can change it - however no browser complained
[12:13:41] <bestdesign> lol
[12:13:45] <bestdesign> code quality!
[12:13:47] <puchacz> I thought it was legal, and it has advantage of preserving whitespace
[12:13:51] <bestdesign> imporve on :)
[12:13:59] <bestdesign> improve one
[12:14:14] <bestdesign>     <div class="container-fluid"  >        <div class="container-fluid"    >
[12:14:20] <bestdesign> you have divs 2 times
[12:14:29] <bestdesign> with same name that also delete
[12:15:03] <puchacz> linebreaks is easy, it is a flag in my code
[12:15:32] <puchacz> things like container-fluid twice are manual errors, I will be fixing them when migrating off bootstrap to something more customised
[12:15:34] <bestdesign> <br/> is not need /
[12:15:44] <puchacz> easier for me to validate internally
[12:15:55] <puchacz> if I generate it in xml-like way
[12:16:18] <bestdesign> well
[12:16:29] <bestdesign> is like a horrible source code :P
[12:16:40] <puchacz> autogenerated, as I say :)
[12:17:03] <bestdesign> then please fix that < char in same line
[12:17:04] <bestdesign> :)
[12:17:11] <bestdesign> how much u work on this?
[12:17:29] <puchacz> find the flag, I forgot where it was. 10 minutes maybe
[12:18:01] <puchacz> by the way, the goal of the website is to create flashcards like this: https://buboflash.eu/bubo5/pdf-page-browser1/149650864/9
[12:18:14] <puchacz> ah, and I tested it in Chrome derivatives only
[12:18:20] <puchacz> so Chromium / Chrome etc.
[12:18:54] <puchacz> you see you have PDF page converted to HTML, and there are annotations and flashcards created from it
[12:19:41] <bestdesign> hmm
[12:21:18] <bestdesign> is good
[12:21:19] <bestdesign> but
[12:21:26] <bestdesign> if i need all data from a paper?
[12:21:45] <puchacz> don't understand...?
[12:22:01] <bestdesign> i mean
[12:22:09] <bestdesign> want all writed content from a paper
[12:22:20] <bestdesign> then why use this?
[12:22:49] <puchacz> I read books on finance. I wouldn't want to memorise the content of the whole book, it would take me a lifetime
[12:23:02] <puchacz> but I upload them, and create flashcards on important points
[12:23:16] <puchacz> then buboflash organises repetitions so I remember it
[12:23:47] <puchacz> if you want whole text as a reference, it is still there, it is just not a part of your flashcard
[12:24:18] <bestdesign> and from what select important things?
[12:24:26] <bestdesign> sections?
[12:24:46] <puchacz> from the text of the PDF, like in the example I pasted, or from a website
[12:24:56] <puchacz> you read and you decide what is important
[12:26:18] <bestdesign> puchacz is ok got that by the way why not use bootstrap grid?
[12:26:27] <bestdesign> https://buboflash.eu/bubo5/log-in?called-from=/bubo5/homepage
[12:26:35] <bestdesign> all things vertical
[12:27:11] <puchacz> I must admit I was using tables sometimes
[12:27:25] <puchacz> I told you migrating to a better style is going to be difficult :(
[12:27:46] <bestdesign> is just 2 div
[12:27:51] <bestdesign> edit index.html
[12:28:52] <puchacz> (by the way, I found that flag, I will set it to "false" so it will have no linebreaks when I redeploy it)
[12:29:44] <bestdesign> ahah :)
[12:30:17] <puchacz> so - what do you think about trees for now and excel like editable grid later?
[12:30:25] <puchacz> any preferred components you have?
[12:31:08] <bestdesign> well for generic looks you used bootstrap for grid also
[12:32:31] <puchacz> there is plenty of "trees": https://www.jqueryscript.net/tags.php?/tree%20view/
[12:32:42] <puchacz> I could spend 2 months exploring them.....
[12:33:41] <bestdesign> :)
[12:33:46] <bestdesign> but why free?
[12:33:57] <bestdesign> make for paid get be millioner
[12:34:05] <puchacz> you mean bubo?
[12:34:13] <puchacz> make it paid?
[12:34:43] <bestdesign> yeah
[12:34:54] <bestdesign> about 15 USD per month
[12:35:01] <bestdesign> ?
[12:35:19] <puchacz> for add-ons, why not. but I want the base platform to remain free, honestly
[12:35:39] <puchacz> and the content to be owned by respective authors
[12:35:52] <bestdesign> and whats ur backend laravel or?
[12:36:08] <puchacz> you see, you work on it, you make notes, it is a precious knowledge, I don't want to claim it
[12:36:12] <puchacz> it is written in Common Lisp
[12:37:06] <bestdesign> :)
[12:41:32] <puchacz> so, anybody got an opinion on a tree component pls?
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> puchacz just pick one that has features that fir your use case.
[12:42:10] <robertmaxrees> not all use cases are the same so it'll be difficult for you to get a definitive "use this one"
[12:42:25] <puchacz> this is why I explained what my website is about....
[12:42:38] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with the one i linked earlier?
[12:42:44] <puchacz> I dunno
[12:42:50] <robertmaxrees> then give it a shot - problem solved :)\
[12:43:07] <puchacz> yeah, I will settle for one, maybe this one
[12:43:20] <puchacz> best to use something that somebody else here already used
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> good luck then
[13:10:59] <ineevu> hello
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> good morning :)
