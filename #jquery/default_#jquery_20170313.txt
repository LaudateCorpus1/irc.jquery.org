[00:25:23] <neq> hola
[00:26:26] <neq> how can i get a particular div with class=A based on an attribute value in its child div
[03:01:20] <Whiskey> <div class="error"><div class="no_match">No matches.</div></div> <- is there any way to use "show()" "hide()" on both this in same time?
[03:07:14] <pavonia> Whiskey: Either on the outer div show affect the inner one too
[03:08:01] <Whiskey> but i don´t get it to work
[03:09:12] <Whiskey> let me show an example
[03:13:25] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/ <- something like that, an function to automtic close the on that are open, and open the one that selected
[03:13:29] <Whiskey> pavonia: :D
[03:30:06] <pavonia> Whiskey: Something like this https://jsfiddle.net/vj26gtnd/1/
[03:32:35] <Whiskey> i think that, thanks
[04:13:31] <Whiskey> pavonia: still there?
[04:14:10] <pavonia> Yes
[04:14:20] <Whiskey> i found out this was not how it looked in the html :D
[04:14:34] <Whiskey> some have the example above that you made, but some also have a third
[04:14:52] <Whiskey> let me make a new test case
[04:21:15] <Whiskey> pavonia: like this https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/3/
[04:22:00] <Whiskey> never mind :D i just add another parent to it :D
[04:22:16] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/4/ like that
[04:23:29] <pavonia> What is the problem with this?
[04:24:13] <Whiskey> nothing, i just tested it before and did not get it to work i think i misspelled something amybe
[04:24:17] <Whiskey> "maybe"
[04:26:43] <Whiskey> strange thing is that i can´t get it to work
[04:28:22] <Whiskey> pavonia: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/51/
[04:29:02] <Whiskey> try match "testd" whit string "testt" then "#result .error .match" is the one to find, but it don´t work
[04:30:57] <pavonia> Uh, that code is far too large. Boil it down to a minimal sample, please
[04:31:59] <Whiskey> i did, but it works in that example
[04:32:05] <Whiskey> but not in my real code
[04:35:55] <Whiskey> console show right information as well
[04:44:58] <Whiskey> aha
[05:40:54] <sigdk> Is there a way to write normal html in the format function instead of returning it as a string? https://datatables.net/examples/server_side/row_details.html ?
[05:51:17] <Whiskey> pavonia: what about https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/5/
[06:40:21] <pavonia> Whiskey: I don't know why that doesn't work. Beside that you want 'class="start hide"' it looks okay
[06:43:42] <Whiskey> i think its really strange
[06:43:56] <Whiskey> and it don´t hide the error in the end ether
[06:45:07] <Whiskey> so 2 errors, it don´t show "#massage .notice .start" and it don´t remove "#massage .error .match" when it go back in end to "#result"
[06:52:09] <Whiskey> pavonia: this is more close, https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/10/
[06:59:19] <pavonia> It's weird, if you put the string directly, it finds the correct element; if you use action, it fails
[07:00:07] <Whiskey> yeh it really is
[07:01:05] <Whiskey> but im my real code it don´t even hide the elements
[07:01:15] <Whiskey> when correct element is selected
[07:02:15] <EugenA> i have a div with a content, it has click event
[07:02:54] <EugenA> How can I exclude inputs inside of my div from click event?
[07:03:57] <pavonia> Whiskey: Oh, your markup was wrong. The first <div> ended with another "<div>"
[07:04:55] <Whiskey> :/
[07:05:01] <Whiskey> i think i got it working
[07:05:08] <Whiskey> do you have paste on the correct markup?
[07:06:17] <Whiskey> i don´t find it
[07:07:12] <Whiskey> markup is fine
[07:07:57] <pavonia> At leats the frist two work https://jsfiddle.net/vj26gtnd/14/
[07:11:17] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vj26gtnd/15/ alot more close :D
[07:12:14] <pavonia> I'm afk for a while
[07:12:24] <Whiskey> :P
[07:25:51] <Whiskey> pavonia: thanks alot for your help, is going forwared now i think :)

[08:04:13] <gambl0re> shit
[08:04:15] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/zarotig/edit?js,output
[08:04:35] <gambl0re> how do i make it so that the ball doesnt bounces and then eventually stops?
[08:07:19] <DelphiWorld> yo everyone
[08:07:38] <DelphiWorld> i have a select but change event isn't happening, paste: https://paste.laravel.io/OznAp
[08:07:47] <DelphiWorld> someone check?
[09:44:41] <realies> im using $.post and want to know how to redirect depending on what the server says after post?
[09:48:36] <Cork> realies: what do you mean by redirect?
[09:48:42] <Cork> change the current page?
[09:48:55] <realies> Cork, yeah
[09:49:02] <Cork> sorry, bad question
[09:49:14] <Cork> you mean load a different page based on the response?
[09:49:42] <realies> Cork, I mean understand where the server wants you to be after it sends code 302
[09:49:54] <Cork> ah
[09:49:59] <Cork> 302 is invisible to ajax
[09:50:03] <Cork> you can't react to it
[09:50:08] <realies> O_O
[09:50:21] <Cork> the browsers follows 302 before js is ever called
[09:50:28] <Cork> so you get the end page from the 302 redirect
[09:50:42] <realies> im not sure if that's true
[09:50:50] <realies> im doing $.post in the web page
[09:50:55] <realies> surely that's part of the callback
[09:50:59] <Cork> nope
[09:51:24] <Cork> $.post calls XMLHttpRequest and it is what handles 3xx response codes
[09:51:50] <Cork> after it has followed the 302 and get a 2xx response THAT is then returned to the handle in it
[09:52:05] <Cork> and following that returned to $.post().done
[09:52:14] <realies> ok then, if i have to go one level up, I'm trying to replace a value of a form before sending it to the server.
[09:52:32] <realies> doesn't have to be a XMLHttpRequest
[09:52:51] <realies> i'm already capturing the event with $("form").submit(function(e)...
[09:52:58] <realies> and am doing e.preventDefault()
[09:53:07] <Cork> uh, that has nothing to do with the response from the server
[09:53:14] <Cork> that goes before the submit
[09:53:29] <Cork> when you do $.post(url, data <-- here)
[09:57:27] <realies> Cork, so can u change a value of a field before the form is submitted instead of doing the submission with $.post?
[09:57:43] <Cork> sure
[09:57:56] <sigdk> gentlemen, any idea since if (row.child() === undefined) is true, why it doesn't complain when I call row.child.isShown()  right after? https://jsfiddle.net/8j2fsb2f/16/    ?
[09:58:02] <Cork> just select the element in the form and modify it and then let the event exit without calling anything specific
[09:58:19] <realies> Cork, gonna give it a go
[09:58:24] <Cork> sigdk: row.child != row.child()
[09:58:58] <sigdk> Cork, hmmm... good point
[09:59:08] <Cork> so check row.child === undefined
[09:59:25] <Cork> as row.child is an object, not a function
[10:00:33] <sigdk> Cork, well, it's also a function. Tbh, it should expand the row below the one I click
[10:01:06] <Cork> sigdk: javascript doesn't support multiple values on the same name
[10:01:25] <Cork> so it can't be both a function and an object
[10:01:46] <Cork> hmm, unless it is a constructor
[10:01:56] <Cork> doesn't make sense why it would be one though
[10:03:30] <sigdk> Cork, I'm trying to reproduce on jsfiddle something that I have locally and works. Here the statement looks like this: row.child(formatRowDetails()).show();   and when I click... the string return from formatRowDetails appears
[10:03:34] <sigdk> it's also here: https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().child()
[10:05:02] <Whiskey> action = "#link .succeeded" and "#link .failed" <- don´t $(action).parent().hide(); means that it only hide ".failed" and ".succeeded"?
[10:05:19] <Cork> sigdk: ya, looks like it is a constructor
[10:06:06] <Whiskey> as in my code it only hide #link
[10:06:20] <Whiskey> witch i prefere to leve untuched :D
[10:07:06] <Whiskey> no wait
[10:07:26] <Whiskey> i thinked it was children :D
[10:11:51] <sigdk> Cork, any idea why the row does not expand? (then I have another question :-)
[10:12:13] <Cork> no, i haven't ever used datatable so don't know its innings
[10:16:30] <Anticom> sigdk: what's your current revision of that fiddle?
[10:16:49] <sigdk> Anticom, https://jsfiddle.net/8j2fsb2f/19/
[10:17:06] <sigdk> https://jsfiddle.net/8j2fsb2f/20/
[10:17:30] <Anticom> And what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:18:59] <sigdk> Anticom, just click on a row and expand it with a "Hello World"... seems to work locally
[10:21:00] <Anticom> sigdk: i don't know where you did find the .child property, but i can't find it in the docs https://api.jquery.com/?s=child
[10:21:04] <Anticom> i only know about .children()
[10:22:27] <Anticom> also in datatables API https://datatables.net/reference/api/ there's no child property but only a child fn
[10:22:29] <Anticom> on row
[10:22:33] <Anticom> or am i missing something?
[10:23:16] <sigdk> Anticom, see this example: https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().child().show()
[10:24:16] <sigdk> Anticom, and this: https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().child.show()
[10:28:19] <Anticom> lol that's funny. I never saw that in chrome dev tools. I did a console.log(row.child) and got "[object Object]" but i can't expand it. I know it's offtopic here at #jquery, but does anybody off their head know what that means?
[10:31:03] <shoky_> Anticom: if that's the exact code you used, it means that row.child is a string, that was created from turning some object into a string, e.g. by doing:  row.child = '' + object;
[10:31:42] <Anticom> shoky_: but console.log() usually logs objects as objects
[10:31:52] <Anticom> i don't get it
[10:31:55] <shoky_> Anticom: yes, but i just said it's a string, not an object ;)
[10:31:59] <Anticom> maybe some proxy weirdness?
[10:32:06] <shoky_> no, it's what i said..
[10:32:10] <Anticom> shoky_: well technically strings are objects aswell in js ;)
[10:32:10] <Anticom> :D
[10:32:19] <shoky_> that's not helpful ;)
[10:32:40] <Anticom> yea but still why would row contain a string like that in one of its properties
[10:32:52] <shoky_> how should i know? someone put it there
[10:33:53] <shoky_> (i have no idea what `row` is)
[10:33:56] <sigdk> Anticom, okay, I'm a beginner on jquery/js ... but, I guess you can pass html as string and have it rendered there
[10:35:34] <Anticom> shoky_: was giving sigdk's issue a shot ( https://jsfiddle.net/8j2fsb2f/20/ )
[10:36:58] <shoky_> Anticom: and where do you put console.log(row.child) that gives you [object Object] ?
[10:37:53] <Anticom> shoky_: L12
[10:37:59] <DelphiWorld> hi guys
[10:38:01] <Anticom> where else should it be?
[10:38:09] <DelphiWorld> is it pocible to get the index of a select element using jquery?
[10:38:24] <shoky_> Anticom: it's logging the function for me.. not [object Object]
[10:38:32] <Anticom> HAX!
[10:39:00] <Anticom> defuq, now it's logging fn for me too
[10:39:08] <shoky_> there you go ;p
[10:44:28] <sigdk> Anticom, soooo?
[10:50:18] <DelphiWorld> am i doing something wrong here in this line? document.getElementById("radiologo").src =this.selectedIndex'.png';
[10:50:41] <DelphiWorld> i am changing the source of the img tag dynamicaly, but it look like i'm doing something wrong with the string?
[10:50:49] <shoky_> this.selectedIndex'.png'    ?
[10:51:09] <DelphiWorld> shoky_: "this" is targetting a select element, i am runing that in the on change event
[10:51:17] <DelphiWorld> shoky_: $('#playlist').on('change', function() {
[10:51:26] <shoky_> DelphiWorld:  that's not how you concatenate
[10:51:30] <shoky_> not like this:  this.selectedIndex'.png'
[10:51:48] <DelphiWorld> so how shoky_ ?
[10:51:53] <Cork> DelphiWorld: your missing the +
[10:51:58] <DelphiWorld> ah
[10:52:21] <DelphiWorld> Cork, document.getElementById("radiologo").src =this.selectedIndex+'.png';
[10:52:32] <Cork> yup
[10:52:45] <DelphiWorld> it's going!
[10:53:14] <DelphiWorld> now how to get the label of that selected element, and not only the value?
[10:54:03] <shoky_> $(this).find(':selected').text()
[10:54:44] * hlve slaps Cork with a trout.
[10:54:44] <Cork> var select = document.getElementById('radiologo'); select.children[select.selectedIndex].innerText
[10:54:51] <Cork> <_<
[10:55:03] <Cork> DelphiWorld: if you want to do it without jquery
[10:55:16] <Cork> though, not sure why you're asking in jquery if you are
[10:55:34] <DelphiWorld> i am doing with jquery, just the img tag didnt know how to target it
[10:56:51] <Cork> $('#radilogo').attr('src', $(this).find(':selected').text()); then
[10:58:19] <DelphiWorld> Cork: $('#radiologo').attr('src', $(this).find(':selected').index());
[10:58:19] <DelphiWorld> no?
[10:58:26] <DelphiWorld> it should be the index.png
[10:58:35] <Cork> no, that would get you the index of the selected element
[10:58:49] <Cork> and then you can just as well use $(this).val() or this.selectedIndex
[10:58:49] <DelphiWorld> yes that what i want
[10:58:54] <DelphiWorld> the label is for the fig caption
[10:58:57] <Cork> ah
[10:59:10] <Cork> would go with this.selectedIndex then
[10:59:16] <DelphiWorld> yeah
[10:59:51] <DelphiWorld> $('#radiologo').attr('src', $(this).selectedIndex); then
[10:59:53] <DelphiWorld> right?
[11:00:17] <DelphiWorld> $('#radiologo').attr('src', $(this).selectedIndex)+.png;
[11:00:34] <Cork> $('#radiologo').attr('src', $(this).selectedIndex + '.png')
[11:01:54] <DelphiWorld> let's see ;)
[11:02:36] <DelphiWorld> now the problem is in the figcaption...
[11:06:15] <DelphiWorld> ok, i'll forget the figcaption for now, and just use a generic label "logo"
[11:16:10] <Whiskey> how do i select "#id" > .someclass
[11:16:23] <Whiskey> is children will select all right? just not curent
[11:17:14] <Cork> Whiskey: is "#id > .someclass" what you're looking for?
[11:17:25] <Cork> the question doesn't really make sense
[11:24:46] <DelphiWorld> thanks codelahoma everything is functional!
[11:26:03] <DelphiWorld> thanks Cork everything is functional!
[11:26:10] <Cork> nice
[11:26:25] <DelphiWorld> i'm sure styling is so crapy lol
[11:27:34] <Whiskey> how to select last id or class cork
[11:27:36] <Whiskey> always
[11:27:45] <Cork> uh $('id')
[11:27:54] <Cork> there can only be one id existance
[11:28:15] <Whiskey> well i think if its build up whit like 3 divs one id or class for every div
[11:28:15] <Cork> if you want the id of the last element with a specific call use $('.class').last().attr('id')
[11:28:30] <Whiskey> last will work i think :=)
[11:28:34] <Whiskey> thanks
[11:30:01] <Whiskey> action = "#link .succeeded" | $(action).hide(); does that only hide ".succeeded" or both "#link" and ".succeeded"
[11:30:36] <Cork> Whiskey: learn how css selectors work
[11:32:31] <Cork> Whiskey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors
[11:32:46] <Cork> i recommend reading through the entire css selectors section
[12:15:35] <alienware> any good tutorials for adding dark overlays on click?

[12:20:07] <alienware> Yeah but I didn't want to use bootstrap

[16:07:24] <cmrabet> Hi all, I'm trying to use a global variable inside an ajax call but it doesn't work.
[16:08:23] <cmrabet> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9ac400695df4ba54aa2454fe945427d3
[16:08:56] <pavonia> juinn: Is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/kvfnr9ss/1/
[16:09:22] <cmrabet> The cariable inform is always false even when I pass it as true in the function argument. Also if I put a console.log(inform) anywhere inside the success call, then it works!!! ¿?¿?¿?¿?
[16:10:24] <juinn> pavonia: you genius haha :)
[16:10:34] <juinn> pavonia: thank you...been bugging me for ages
[16:10:44] <pavonia> No problem :)
[16:12:53] <juinn> pavonia: another problem i can see with it also is that im unable to select month or year

[16:22:55] <pavonia> juinn: You could probably find out the two dropdown ids/classes in the datepicker and check whether one of them has focus before hiding the datepicker
[16:49:39] <momomo> is jQuery().length overriden someplace?
[16:49:59] <momomo> or neverminde
[16:50:05] <momomo> just figured it out
[16:58:10] <cjohnson> I've got a page with a checkbox on it. When I load the page, I get scrolled to the bottom, where hte checkbox is, and the checkbox is focused. I've tried really hard to figure out what is focusing on it but I can't seem to. Any debugging tips? My guess is it's happening through jquery
[16:59:01] <doe_>   /quit
[16:59:02] <cjohnson> Maybe I could write inline js directly after the <input> that attaches a listener on focus and the body is debugger; ? I wonder if that would work
