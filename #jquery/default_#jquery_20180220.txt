[04:08:29] <fono> hi, someone know how to turn ul li list to selector like this --> https://jsfiddle.net/postie/bahd3qcg/5/
[04:15:49] <Cork> fono: you mean you want to build a <optgroup><option> from nested ul > li?
[04:16:09] <Cork> or what is the question?
[04:26:06] * AdamPDotty doesnt like them class names.
[04:26:19] <AdamPDotty> To be or not to be?
[04:26:55] <Cork> what class names are you referring to?
[04:27:19] <AdamPDotty> nav-tabs; nav1; notHover
[04:27:40] <Cork> ah didn't even see the notHover
[04:27:56] <Cork> ya, agreed
[04:28:41] <Cork> (wouldn't like them in my projects, but i'm not going to bust anyones head for using them :) )
[04:29:53] <fono> Cork: yes
[04:30:48] <Cork> fono: i would do it with a recursive function walking the child tree
[04:31:06] <Cork> then just building the dom tree from there
[04:44:20] <Cork> fono: can't be nested so deep, but https://jsfiddle.net/bahd3qcg/19/
[04:44:32] <Cork> you should hopefully be able to build from that
[05:59:24] <Johnson1977> Hi. How can I change a byte array into a unsigned INT?
[06:00:54] <Cork> Johnson1977: you mean convert it from a bytaarray to an uint16Array?
[06:01:06] <Johnson1977> yes I guess so
[06:01:26] <Johnson1977> I was doing it in python, but im not sure how to do it in JS
[06:01:54] <Cork> should be as easy as new Uint16Array(byteArray) if i remember correctly
[06:02:00] <Cork> haven't fiddled with it for ages though
[06:02:37] <Cork> alternatively https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/from
[06:03:22] <Johnson1977> mmm, i already havve it in a byte array
[06:03:23] <Cork> Johnson1977: you need to be a little bit more specific what exact number format you want though
[06:03:29] <Johnson1977> and the values are correct
[06:03:50] <Johnson1977> example
[06:03:50] <Johnson1977> tent [ 116, 101, 110, 116 ]
[06:03:53] <Cork> Johnson1977: firstly you need to find what value format you want
[06:04:05] <Johnson1977> I need that to be a unsigned int value
[06:04:12] <Johnson1977> so that array = 1234134
[06:04:13] <Cork> then you have to take the signedint array and convert it to an unsigned to get the correct array
[06:04:16] <Johnson1977> or a number like that
[06:04:35] <Cork> so you want to join the values not convert the array...
[06:06:04] <Cork> Johnson1977: it hsould be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/reduce
[06:09:09] <undefined_bob> when I expand one of my sub-menu, in mobile device view, the expanded sub-menu overlap the other menu items in the list. Is there a way to make it that if I expand a sub-menu, the other menu items will be pushed down instead of being overlapped by the sub-menu? https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/WMjWba
[06:16:14] <AdamPDotty> then do not give the sub-menu position:absolute;
[06:26:32] <undefined_bob> thanks Adam, I'll try that
[08:09:17] <Buoy172> How can I check if a variable is defined without getting errors in the console? Currently I have: https://pastebin.com/fY31kAgH
[08:09:30] <Buoy172> And I get the console error "Uncaught ReferenceError: Android is not defined"
[08:10:25] <AdamPDotty> if (typeof var === 'undefined') ..
[08:11:34] <Buoy172> yeah that works, thanks
[08:13:24] <Cork> also if it is part of an object you can just check it straight off
[08:13:58] <thykka> n> !!Android
[08:14:12] <thykka> aww :<
[08:14:23] <thykka> >> !!Android
[08:14:34] <thykka> oh, this is not ##javascript
[08:14:37] <thykka> figures...
[08:14:42] <Cork> thykka: wrong channel, and it won't work for undefined variables
[08:15:12] <thykka> !!window['Android'] then :]
[08:15:26] <Cork> as long as you're not in a scriped area ya
[08:16:23] <Cork> (function() { if(!!window['Android']) {} })() wouldn't work if what you want to test are for (function() { var Android = true; if(!!window['Android']) {} })()
[08:17:14] * AdamPDotty never knows which bot is on duty.
[08:33:45] <KnightsOfNi> Hi I'm using datatables.net - I am rendering a select box in one of the columns. Does anyone know how I can make the filter only work on the seleced value of that select box, rather than the whole content of it?
[08:35:04] <Cork> you most likely have to provide some form of custom filter function if datatables support that
[08:36:10] <KnightsOfNi> I don't know
[08:41:33] <dsfsdf> Cork, Hi do you know how to make own encryptor?
[08:41:55] <Cork> wat? "your own encryptor"?
[08:42:02] <dsfsdf> I'm going to add licence key to my code
[08:42:10] <Cork> don't
[08:42:19] <Cork> drm doesn't work for the web
[08:42:39] <Cork> if you absolutely need to require license, do the job on a dedicated server that the user have to use
[08:42:44] <dsfsdf> Cork, ok, but this is badly if somebody will use our code or will able to copy it whenever he wants...
[08:42:46] <Cork> cause everything else won't work
[08:43:00] <Cork> dsfsdf: ya, that is how the web works
[08:43:17] <dsfsdf> Do you think it's impossible?
[08:43:58] <Cork> javascript is interpreted, if the user is suppose to be able to use it it has to be able to be read
[08:44:09] <Cork> if the code it self can decode it so can the user
[08:44:16] <Cork> that is why those things never work
[08:44:18] <dsfsdf> Cork, For php it is possible, I read there people do encryption and only possible complice code and then using instructions decompile
[08:44:43] <Cork> dsfsdf: it "works" cause ppl can't bother to care about it
[08:44:47] <Cork> not cause it works
[08:45:17] <Cork> the only case when you can do drm, is when the user don't get the code
[08:45:25] <dsfsdf> Cork, no, if code can decode by himself it's not strong encryption, it is one method for encryption, exists other that is impossible decrypt
[08:45:25] <Cork> meaning not interpreted language
[08:45:39] <Cork> dsfsdf: no it doesn't
[08:45:51] <Cork> unless you mean your license key should be a 4096 bit rsa key...
[08:46:08] <dsfsdf> yes, I know, but how hacks code they says it's easy to hack for a few hours
[08:46:54] <dsfsdf> Cork, I mean script make request to my server and there I check this script and domain if it's all right I allow him  works
[08:46:55] <Cork> dsfsdf: you're asking the wrong guy, drm on the web is the _last_ thing i want there
[08:47:42] <dsfsdf> Cork, key long is doesn't matter, you can generate for example 5000 keys and give them users
[08:47:51] <dsfsdf> countable number of keys
[08:47:54] <Cork> dsfsdf: good so have fun
[08:48:10] <undefined_bob> AdamPDotty: I tried your suggestion and it works perfect. thanks again
[08:48:16] <Cork> might want to drop the product name so i can say a mile away from it
[08:48:17] <dsfsdf> what is drm means?
[08:48:25] <Cork> Digital Media Right
[08:48:40] <Cork> meaning here you go, but i decide what you can do
[08:48:52] <dsfsdf> ok
[08:49:23] <dsfsdf> Cork, no In general I want to encrypt php scripts, just I see there equal method for javascript and for php that with eval
[08:49:57] <Cork> dsfsdf: ya, i get it, also worth noting, more and more companies refuces to have anything to do with code like that
[08:50:12] <Cork> (the requirement is quite often apache or more liberal)
[08:50:25] <Cork> lime mit
[08:50:34] <Cork> like*
[08:51:44] <dsfsdf> Cork, I understand, but will only encrypted a one page where will this licence key is checked, all left pages will usual php code, it won't all project encrypted and company will able to rebuild project if something will wrong
[08:51:53] <Cork> dsfsdf: the protectionalistic view of code kinda died early 2k, when companies saw how much extra costs is meant for them when they couldn't be sure the product they built could be developed by them if they needed to
[08:51:56] <dsfsdf> if you do all project encrypted this is bad
[08:52:23] <Cork> no, if you encrypt code to obfustace to force the customer to pay you is a bad idea, period
[08:52:53] <dsfsdf> Cork, why? this is good idea, pay and use
[08:53:06] <Cork> if the code is so simple that the customer doesn't see what value you bring, then what are you adding?
[08:53:23] <dsfsdf> Cork, or hire programmers who decrypt code, but cheaper for him it's by new copy of code
[08:53:30] <Cork> let the license be part of the license and let the customer honnor the license or sue them
[08:53:39] <Cork> O_o'
[08:54:03] <Cork> how much do you charge if hiring a developer to deobfuscate it is _CHEAPER_
[08:54:05] <dsfsdf> Cork, many people do this
[08:55:59] <Cork> and yes it happens quite a bit in php, but hey it is php what do you expect :)
[08:56:12] <dsfsdf> Cork, much, it can take one week or more, but I not interesting make encryption with possibilites to deobfuscate, I'm interesting to do encryption where user can only complile code in assampler byte code and then only rebuild real code. It will cost much and easier it's by one more script
[08:56:16] <Cork> its among the most shitty code you can ever find
[08:56:55] <Cork> lightly better then vba
[08:57:04] <Cork> s+
[08:57:34] <Cork> (and i have developed php for 10+ years so i've experienced a lot of it)
[08:58:21] <dsfsdf> Cork, as I know decompliler of php were only 4 and 3 of them was written Russian programmer, company that is do encryption program forbid to recompile their code. I badly know this domain but in Englsh internet little information about decompile
[08:58:59] <Cork> ya, i've encontered it too, though it usually takes a bout 10-15 second to break those
[08:59:09] <Cork> as, like i said, to run it you have to be able to decode it
[08:59:14] <Cork> and hence copy it
[08:59:35] <dsfsdf> Cork, do you want I show php code where impossible deencrypt. You need only machine instruction rebuild in php code, but real code you never  will know
[08:59:47] <Cork> it is quite liked to do by ransom sites so ya...
[08:59:55] <Cork> dsfsdf: no it isn't
[09:00:15] <Cork> the only difference is that you have to have access to a server that are allowed to use it
[09:00:34] <Cork> while for javascript you have access to the http response from a sites allowed to use it
[09:00:43] <Cork> QUITE a bit lower bar there
[09:01:57] <dsfsdf> Cork, it's impossible, I can show you file that is php code and you couldn't deencrypt it, I couldn't have done. See this https://pastebin.com/6XLeZAAx
[09:02:17] <Cork> dsfsdf: you're kinda missing the point
[09:02:51] <dsfsdf> Cork, Yes I remember we speak about it this server should send special header
[09:02:52] <Cork> for php: if customerX have bought it and has the key and the code on serverX, the code on serverX can run and hence decrypted and read
[09:03:05] <dsfsdf> we must create this server of course
[09:03:34] <Cork> for javascript: if you know a site that uses it, the same source IS SENT TO THE BROWSER so just visit them and save the decrypted source
[09:03:57] <Cork> cause the browser has to be able to decrypt it, else it can't run it
[09:04:15] <Cork> and that means with a few lines in the console the one wanting it can just extract and save it
[09:04:41] <dsfsdf> in this big file hidden functions that  forbids use php script on multiple domain and a few other functons as well, if you remove this file all left script doesn't work. This is very nice made. I'm very impressed. I want to do equal thing
[09:06:13] <dsfsdf> Cork, ok, for one javascript it's not applicable, because apps will as usual consists from no one technologise.  Passed this theme
[09:06:35] <dsfsdf> it seems enough complex, but very interesting :)
[09:09:17] <dsfsdf> Cork, decrypted sorce will use domain name and for each domain server will return its own hashcode. It will impossible use the same hashcode for other domains
[09:10:00] <dsfsdf> main problem it's encrypt file, rest is simple, it's up to you. how it will be
[09:11:05] <Cork> dsfsdf: except this has to happen client side, not server side
[09:11:15] <Cork> else you have to send it decrypted to the visitor
[09:11:27] <Cork> and for the visitor to decrypt it, you have to send the key to the client
[09:11:38] <Cork> hence not encrypted, but obfuscated
[09:13:08] <Cork> (there are even ready made extensions for browsers to deobfuscate code like that)
[09:13:44] <dsfsdf> Cork, no see how it will work, encrypted script get domainname and make hash using his own alhorithm, then send this to the server, server decrypt hash and check domain from where was this request than doing his own hash and send it to the client back, Client script check Or or No, if Ok it allow use screep if not forbid
[09:14:08] <dsfsdf> and we can do it temporrary, send once request to the server in a one day
[09:14:40] <dsfsdf> it's not importent, all of this depends on your fantasy, main problem it's encrypt script
[09:14:40] <Cork> dsfsdf: ya, so 1. the one wanting the script visits a site they know use it, like the demo page of the seller. 2. he pops open the browser console and grabs the javascript blob
[09:14:58] <Cork> 3. he runs the script in the page, but slightly modified so instead of evaling the code it prints
[09:15:12] <Cork> 4. he saves the deobfuscated code to use it for his own site
[09:15:48] <Cork> the only way you can get around that is _to not use javascript_
[09:16:49] <dsfsdf> Cork, do you see many scripts that is paid and they are made only using javascript? Of course majoirity products will use php
[09:16:59] <Cork> dsfsdf: doesn't matter
[09:17:04] <dsfsdf> javascript is part of product
[09:17:06] <Cork> what the browser sees has to work
[09:17:17] <Cork> dsfsdf: so why fiddle with the js?
[09:17:26] <Cork> just have the php code be what they pay for
[09:17:47] <MikeD_> you can put your secret sauce behind a web service, call it for all the business logic it hides
[09:18:03] <Cork> ya, never ever put sensitive things in js
[09:18:14] <dsfsdf> ok
[09:18:48] <Cork> its like giving the burglar and alarm code and safe keys and "please leave it there and don't touch anything"
[09:19:07] <Cork> js are sent to the visitor, don't expect it to never be modified
[09:19:15] <Cork> or even executed in the first place
[09:20:18] <MikeD_> that's also an important point on the "don't trust client-side data integrity checks to prevent garbage server-side"
[09:20:28] <Cork> ya
[09:21:23] <dsfsdf> ok, here many possibilities... Many schemes.
[09:21:32] <MikeD_> though i think that's one that you don't really learn until it bites you in the ass and then you realize what all those geezers were bitching about when you did it wrong in the first place
[09:21:48] <MikeD_> (i say that 'cuz i'm now a geezer)
[09:21:53] <Cork> lol
[09:22:25] <dsfsdf> ok
[09:22:31] * Cork hands MikeD_ a gray beard
[09:23:03] <MikeD_> "back in MY day, internet speed was measured in 'baud'  "
[09:28:23] <webbb> h
[09:28:24] <webbb> hi
[09:28:42] <webbb> so the user should be able to select existing items, ideally from an autocomplete list
[09:28:54] <webbb> and then the item is added below and can be reordered/removed by the user
[09:28:59] <webbb> how is this pattern/ui control called?
[09:29:03] <webbb> is there a jquery control for this?
[09:29:47] <MikeD_> sounds like a list-mover
[09:31:01] <webbb> ah nice
[09:32:59] <Cork> webbb: you could have a look at jquery-ui selectable
[09:33:16] <Cork> all you need except for that is a way to trigger removal of the selected row
[09:33:40] <Cork> (though there are a ton of way to do that, fairly simply)
[09:38:19] <webbb> Cork: I am using the dropdown-pages control in WordPress
[09:38:28] <webbb> WP comes with many JQuery/JQuery UI plugins
[09:38:37] <webbb> can I combine a dropdown-pages with a sortable or something like this?
[14:41:05] <donguston> Trying to add a delay between jquery clicks on an element, got this so far but its just not working.
[14:41:07] <donguston> $("#reaction_profile_browser").find(".FriendRequestAdd").click(function(){ setTimeout(function(){$(this).css({"background":"green"})},5000); }).click();
[14:41:29] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle or something?
[14:41:58] <robertmaxrees> also: you're not stopping the original handler.
[14:42:40] <donguston> yeah I dont want to stop the original one, just click the button with a delay between clicks
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> also: your 'this' isn't what you think it is there.
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> 'this' changes within each function.
[14:45:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta either use a fat arrow, use Array.prototype.bind on the callbak for setTimeout, or store the result of $(this) in a var and then use that inside the callback.
[14:58:26] <donguston> ah ok
[14:58:50] <donguston> my account has just been blocked from sending requests atm, but it appears to be working otherwise.
[15:04:07] <Woet> donguston: can you stop being the internet a terrible place?
[15:04:54] <taplar> o.O
[15:05:35] <Woet> taplar: one of those "mass facebook friend request" scripts
[15:06:23] <taplar> oh, dunno anything about that stuff.  i stalk fb like once every six months.
[15:18:42] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:18:44] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:19:40] <schooner> How can I take an array of elements and reduce it to an array of a specific attribute on those elements?
[15:19:55] <robertmaxrees> is it a jquery object or an array?
[15:19:58] <schooner> i know theres .map and .reduce but i forget which one is appropriate
[15:20:09] <schooner> $('.tag')
[15:20:14] <robertmaxrees> so a jquery object.
[15:20:17] <schooner> yes
[15:20:17] <robertmaxrees> use .map().get()
[15:20:48] <schooner> what am I using .get for? isnt that an ajax function
[15:20:55] <robertmaxrees> not in this case.
[15:20:59] <robertmaxrees> it's to turn it into an array.
[15:21:15] <Woet> you use .get to use our online array reducer saas product
[15:21:22] <Woet> dont worry it uses blockchain and is in the cloud so it's all good
[15:21:35] <schooner> lol
[15:24:10] <schooner> robertmaxrees: not sure i understand how to use those together
[15:24:20] <schooner> can you provide an example?
[15:24:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:24:30] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting lost?
[15:25:02] <robertmaxrees> showing me what you've tried would be helpful :)
[15:29:44] <schooner> got it, i was using my map function wrong
[15:29:52] <robertmaxrees> rad :)
[15:30:07] <schooner> $.map( '.tag',... instead of $('.tag).map(...
[15:30:35] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> no
[15:30:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sfoe7pse/2/
[15:31:10] <robertmaxrees> $('input').map(function() {}).get()
[15:31:26] <schooner> yeah i mean i was doing the first way by mistake
[15:31:31] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:31:51] <schooner> so when i use .get() on a jquery object, it returns the elements as an array?
[15:32:23] <robertmaxrees> yar.

[18:41:19] <nabil> robertBusy here is it with the jinja2 part rendered
[18:41:20] <nabil> https://pastebin.com/c0U48pf3
[18:42:54] <robertBusy> heh
[18:48:37] <robertBusy> so first off
[18:48:45] <robertBusy> why are you implementing time selectors using dropdowns?
[18:50:43] <robertBusy> second: a: $('#selgroup option:selected')
[18:50:47] <robertBusy> what are you trying to get with this?
[18:54:57] <robertBusy> welp
[18:56:17] <nabil> robertmaxrees get the selected option from select tag
[18:57:46] <robertmaxrees> nabil and do what with it?
[18:57:56] <robertmaxrees> that's returning a jquery object, which is what's breaking.
[18:58:05] <nabil> pass it to the server
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:58:11] <nabil> funtion _pastit
[18:58:13] <nabil> in python
[18:58:14] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[18:58:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to pass a jquery object to the server.
[18:58:45] <nabil> I think i did pass the text of it, no?
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:59:06] <robertmaxrees> $('#selgroup option:selected') is passing a jquery object.
[18:59:15] <nabil> a: $('#selgroup option:selected').text() would be correct?
[18:59:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:59:32] <robertmaxrees> do you want the values of all the selected options?
[19:00:09] <nabil> yes, that's right, I was trying to get it right with group
[19:00:14] <nabil> then generalize to all of them
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[19:00:27] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna need to do some more work than that :)
[19:00:37] <robertmaxrees> you can use .serialize() on the form.
[19:00:45] <robertmaxrees> but also: why are you using dropdowns for time inputs?
[19:01:09] <nabil> quick solution for the unexperienced me
[19:01:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> so i would seriously reconsider doing those with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time
[19:02:08] <robertmaxrees> or inputs with validation slapped on them.
[19:02:59] <nabil> looks better !
[19:03:42] <nabil> thanks, I'm open to other suggestions if you have any
[19:03:58] <robertmaxrees> JUST THOSE
[19:04:02] <robertmaxrees> *just those
[19:04:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:04:31] <nabil> so I'd pass it as input
[19:04:42] <nabil> and get it like this server side
[19:04:46] <nabil> a = request.args.get('a', 0, type=time)
[19:04:46] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:04:54] <nabil> for ex
[19:04:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:05:16] <nabil> a = request.args.get('a', type=time)
[19:05:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that's referring to.
[19:05:28] <robertmaxrees> that your server-side?
[19:05:32] <nabil> time input
[19:05:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:05:45] <robertmaxrees> you lost me.
[19:05:54] <nabil> ok ok XD
[19:05:55] <robertmaxrees> "
[19:06:00] <nabil> one other question
[19:06:05] <robertmaxrees> is that in your python or your js?
[19:06:10] <nabil> in python
[19:06:16] <nabil> it's running on flask
[19:06:21] <robertmaxrees> ah, been a long time.
[19:06:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to ship JSON to your server, though.
[19:06:45] <nabil> yes
[19:07:02] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[19:07:38] <nabil> I have another question, see the sprinkle ID 1, I'll be having a list like that, generated using jinja2
[19:07:51] <nabil> here left only one to simplify it
[19:08:12] <nabil> what would be an efficient way to handle all of them in jquery
[19:08:23] <robertmaxrees> handle... how?
[19:08:35] <robertmaxrees> likle, what are you doing with them?
[19:08:49] <nabil> Yes, like what I'm doing with one
[19:09:08] <nabil> but they all have separate IDs,
[19:09:18] <nabil> different*
[19:09:34] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[19:09:39] <robertmaxrees> they should all have a shared semantic class.
[19:09:48] <robertmaxrees> though actually.
[19:09:54] <robertmaxrees> you only care about the form context, right?
[19:10:00] <robertmaxrees> *contents
[19:10:37] <nabil> yes, so that when the user clicks submit (the schedule) it passes it to the server along with info about the Id he just changed
[19:10:58] <nabil> schedule and group*
[19:11:23] <robertmaxrees> could always stick a hidden input in the form with the ID you care about.
[19:12:15] <nabil> and just one function to handle them, right?
[19:12:26] <robertmaxrees> yar.
[19:12:27] <nabil> (the difference would be that hidden input)
[19:13:04] <nabil> How would I bind all the buttons to that function, and make it consider only the relevent form
[19:13:37] <robertmaxrees> use a class or something for all the buttons you want to watch.
[19:13:49] <robertmaxrees> then use dom traversal against $(this) to get the correct form.
[19:14:28] <nabil> Ok ... any link with similar ex (to get an idea)
[19:15:35] <robertmaxrees> which part of that is confusing?
[19:15:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler
[19:15:50] <robertmaxrees> basically, $(this) is the element that triggered the handler.
[19:16:09] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('form') would get the nearest form element ancestor.
[19:16:34] <nabil> So they must share a parent ?
[19:16:44] <robertmaxrees> the button should be a child of the form, yes.
[19:16:50] <robertmaxrees> there a reason it isn't?
[19:17:02] <nabil> no
[19:17:11] <robertmaxrees> you can also traverse around and do like $(this).closest('.someSharedParent').find('form')
[19:17:12] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[19:17:15] <nabil> maybe because I put it in foot
[19:17:21] <robertmaxrees> that's fine
[19:17:24] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to traverse.
[19:17:47] <nabil> and the class part you talked about
[19:17:47] <nabil> ?
[19:17:54] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[19:18:31] <nabil> I don't have a good idea on what is it
[19:18:38] <robertmaxrees> classes?
[19:18:40] <robertmaxrees> for html?
[19:18:55] <nabil> "use a class or something for all the buttons you want to watch."
[19:19:01] <robertmaxrees> like
[19:19:06] <robertmaxrees> put a class on those buttons.
[19:19:15] <nabil> css class?
[19:19:18] <robertmaxrees> *class
[19:19:23] <robertmaxrees> classes aren't just for css :)
[19:19:28] <robertmaxrees> they're for JS and readability, too.
[19:19:37] <nabil> aah
[19:20:28] <nabil> for the dom traversal, I'm thinking about putting both in a div element then I would go to parent
[19:20:32] <nabil> then back to form
[19:20:44] <nabil> seems correct?
[19:20:48] <robertmaxrees> erm
[19:20:54] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to add any markup.
[19:21:17] <nabil> ah, os just use an existent div
[19:21:18] <nabil> ?
[19:21:48] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't you?
[19:22:04] <nabil> yes you're right
[19:22:36] <nabil> Thank you for your help, I appreciate it
[19:22:47] <robertmaxrees> def :) also:
[19:23:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/cyshufyw/2/
[19:23:15] <robertmaxrees> this moves the form element.
[19:23:23] <robertmaxrees> so you can just listen for the form's submit event.
[19:23:30] <robertmaxrees> instead of the specific buttons.,
[19:25:39] <nabil> what is changed in the fiddle link ?
[19:25:51] <robertmaxrees> look at the <form> and </form>
[19:27:19] <robertmaxrees> just moved them around.
[19:27:31] <nabil> changed their places in the code ?
[19:27:34] <robertmaxrees> yes
[19:27:38] <robertmaxrees> so the contents of the modal are all inside it.
[19:28:00] <robertmaxrees> makes your travesal a bit simpler.
[19:28:16] <nabil> aah, I think I get it
[19:29:41] <nabil> you said something about listening for the form's submit event
[19:29:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:29:52] <robertmaxrees> instead of button clicks.
[19:30:01] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function() {});
[19:30:26] <nabil> and the submit button would input inside it right?
[19:30:52] <robertmaxrees> the input buttom submits the form.
[19:31:36] <nabil> got it
[19:31:48] <robertmaxrees> one of those minor things that saves you headaches.
[19:32:15] <nabil> yep
