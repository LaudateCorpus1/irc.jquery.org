[17:58:34] <Azrael_-> hi
[21:36:27] <jmatic> I have a single page website with multiple sections. The navbar menu is made up of a list of the section names. I'd like to add class (to mark as active) as the user scrolls through each section. For example, if the user is focused on the "Benefits" section I'd like the "Benefits" menu item to be marked with class active.
[21:36:58] <jmatic> What's a good way to accomplish this live as the user scrolls?
[21:38:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll want a throttle scroll event listener that checks where the top and bottom of the viewport is, and then checks to see if any section headings or w/e are in that space.
[21:38:30] <robertmaxrees> or any part of a section, really.
[21:38:31] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[21:40:18] <jmatic> robertmaxrees: thanks! I think that is what I am looking for. It makes sense. I haven't done it before but just found an example. I appreciate the help.
