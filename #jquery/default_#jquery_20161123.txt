[00:22:14] <ismithers> When I see functions like this (refresh, etc) how do I call them? http://hastebin.com/ixubevoziw.js This is code form a .js plugin I'm using and I need to call refresh to update its internals after a page layout change.
[00:29:53] <shoky> ismithers: depends on the plugin and how it exposes those methods. could be .pluginname('method')..  could be  pluginInstance.method()
[00:30:34] <shoky> the plugin docs should tell you. otherwise it's a bad plugin, or you're not supposed to be calling that
[00:30:45] <ismithers> That's the entire plugin (which is under MIT license) http://hastebin.com/ugatubaruk.js Would you be able to identify/tell me how I identify its method of exposing them?
[00:31:08] <ismithers> Yeah the docs don't alas, I've checked already, as well as their issue tracker to see if anyone was triggering it there.
[00:31:24] <ismithers> It has a comment talking about them as static methods, so my thinking was they should be able to be called.
[00:32:44] <NomadJim> If I have a list of tweets that I want to put an AJAX button that will rate them as good or bad, is there a way to store the tweet id in each button, so when the button is clicked the jquery can pull out that tweet id?
[00:33:04] <NomadJim> each tweet would have its own good/bad button
[00:33:14] <ismithers> I feel like I should be able to call $(some-selector).parallax().refresh(); but that wasn't working.
[00:33:39] <ismithers> (The selector that has the parallax instance attached to it that is)
[00:34:40] <NomadJim> looks like I should be using the data-id attribute along w/ .data
[00:36:54] <shoky> ismithers: those static methods live on the Parallax constructor object, it seems
[00:37:16] <shoky> ismithers: and seems you can access it via $.fn.parallax.Constructor
[00:38:00] <shoky> e.g. $.fn.parallax.Constructor.refresh()
[00:38:41] <shoky> NomadJim yeah a data-xx attribute and you can read it with .data('xx')
[00:38:55] <ismithers> Ah yes I understand shoky, thanks for the pointer.
[00:40:04] <shoky> ismithers and to run the instance methods maybe you can do .data('px.parallax').refresh()
[00:40:57] <ismithers> OK will give it a whirl.
[00:41:21] <ismithers> Turns out I may not require it, as I just noticed some CSS is perhaps causing issues with the functionality, so trying that now.
[00:41:48] <NomadJim> shoky:  ty
[00:47:20] <ismithers> Yeah the CSS was doing it, thanks anyway shoky, learned something :)
[02:03:27] <akshayvinchurkar> hi
[02:08:51] <Serg_Penguin> hi! how to show diff between two states of object after jquery plugin was called on it ? I have a bug and what to see what happens
[02:18:07] <hellyeah> how does that idea sound? using jquery with requirejs
[02:18:44] <systemfault> Could you leave requirejs in the garbage?
[02:19:02] <systemfault> That crap has never been a good idea.
[02:19:40] <hellyeah> hmm why?
[02:19:57] <hellyeah> but in order to use nodejs, i need requirejs right
[02:20:02] <hellyeah> is there any other alternative?
[02:20:14] <systemfault> No
[02:20:24] <systemfault> Node has no link with requirejs
[02:20:54] <hellyeah> require("express") for example
[02:20:56] <systemfault> Node is server-side JS. RequireJS is an implementation of AMD for frontend.
[02:21:03] <systemfault> hellyeah: That's not requirejs
[02:21:08] <hellyeah> oh
[02:21:16] <systemfault> Hamburgers don't have Ham in them...
[02:21:23] <systemfault> Java is not JavaScript
[02:21:44] <hellyeah> i plan to read this http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[02:21:46] <systemfault> The require() thing is called "CommonJS module system"
[02:21:50] <hellyeah> do you think it is waste of time
[02:21:53] <systemfault> And that's what you want.
[02:22:04] <systemfault> Forget requirejs...
[02:22:10] <hellyeah> okey
[02:22:12] <systemfault> Just forget it exists.
[02:22:27] <hellyeah> why do you hate it? :D
[02:22:30] <systemfault> Learn how to use commonjs modules "require()" on the frontend.
[02:22:55] <hellyeah> what i want is use require for jquery for example
[02:23:21] <hellyeah> require("QueryUI) require(jQueryUI-datepicker"); and such
[02:23:29] <hellyeah> is that possible
[02:23:40] <systemfault> Because it forces you to write your code in a weird way... Because most of the time you don't need async... You get weird errors when it doesn't work...
[02:23:55] <hellyeah> i see
[02:24:11] <systemfault> I don't know, probably.... I don't use that garbage.
[02:24:11] <hellyeah> so it is iritating
[02:24:14] <OnBrokenWings> also jquery don't have proper exports as I think to use it as different modules
[02:24:42] <hellyeah> OnBrokenWings:  this is what i am looking for if i understand correctly
[02:24:55] <OnBrokenWings> but for example you can use lodash with require or native es6 export/import
[02:24:59] <hellyeah> i wanna use npm
[02:25:21] <systemfault> Then you want to learn how to use either browserify or webpack.
[02:25:34] <systemfault> (Webpack is currently the most popular one)
[02:26:03] <systemfault> You can start with that: http://survivejs.com/webpack/developing-with-webpack/getting-started/
[02:26:07] <hellyeah> hmm es6 export/import?
[02:26:12] <OnBrokenWings> you cant just 'import $ from 'jquery' in es6 or  var $ = require('jquery')
[02:26:43] <OnBrokenWings> and then build it with webpack/browserify etc
[02:27:05] <hellyeah> OnBrokenWings:  can you give me small example with jsfiddle if you dont mind. What you mean is to export jquery library to a variable and use it with require?
[02:27:07] <OnBrokenWings> you can
[02:27:13] <hellyeah> let me check systemfault
[02:27:44] <OnBrokenWings> misspelled
[02:28:01] <hellyeah> mispelled?
[02:28:09] <OnBrokenWings> Survive.js is a good start
[02:30:57] <hellyeah> what about commonJS?
[02:30:58] <OnBrokenWings> also on modules on ES6 - http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html
[02:31:11] <hellyeah> is it the next step learning commonJS?
[02:34:04] <hellyeah> webpack questions are welcommed here?
[02:34:45] <hellyeah> what is vagrant?
[02:34:49] <hellyeah> is it useful?
[02:43:13] <OnBrokenWings> I think you cant start with my link and then continue to Survive.js and read about webpack. Also there are a lot articles to read on medium for example.
[03:06:40] <hellyeah> i am reading survive.js not
[03:06:51] <hellyeah> and i understand what you mean by exporting
[03:07:42] <hellyeah> in the link i read i created component.js which has module.exports
[03:07:52] <hellyeah> so you just export the function as module
[03:07:56] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[03:08:05] <hellyeah> than require it in other file
[03:08:51] <hellyeah> okey thats nice approach
[04:11:22] <baako> morning guys how can i listen to a practical class for when a styling has been added by a 3rd part library? http://kopy.io/Z0CrJ
[04:11:49] <Cork> baako: you can't really listen for that
[04:12:11] <Cork> there is the mutation observers, but it will set quite a limit on what browsers it will run in
[04:13:16] <Cork> baako: the simplest solution if you just want to avoid the styling is override the styling for the css file
[04:19:03] <baako> Cork, thanks
[04:42:00] <mariacheline> Hi, so I'm trying to focus an element whenever it's added.. ie whenever a new message is added i want the page to scroll there or somehow focus http://codepen.io/mariacheline/pen/bBgLzp?editors=0010
[04:42:10] <mariacheline> Can somebody help? D:
[04:43:41] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure if focus works on li, but did you try simply  li.focus()?
[04:44:04] <AdamPDotty> s/if/whether
[04:44:05] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[04:44:30] <mariacheline> tried scrollTop too
[04:45:02] <mariacheline> is there any way i could do that?
[04:47:23] <Cork> you can't focus an element unless it can have focus
[04:47:37] <Cork> normally that only includes form elements and a tags
[04:47:56] <Cork> you can set tabindex="" on the element though
[04:48:13] <AdamPDotty> you can give it an id and set location to that id, but probably there is something easier with scrollTop
[04:48:30] <Cork> but ya, if you want to scroll there use elm.scrollIntoView()
[04:50:22] <Cork> (scrollIntoView has the advantage that it will scroll parents if needed)
[04:50:56] <Cork> though if you want cross browser animation you want to use scrollTop
[04:53:01] <mariacheline> I'm not quite sure how to apply what you've just explained as i'm quite dumb with jquery but i guess i'll try to work on scrollTop
[04:53:54] <Cork> mariacheline: line 10 html[0].scrollIntoView()
[04:56:31] <mariacheline> Oh wow.... thanks D: Cork
[04:58:17] <Cork> np
[05:43:02] <JJjack> hi
[05:43:34] <JJjack> how is the submit  working in this example?
[05:43:35] <JJjack> http://demo.improvely.com/reports/webshop/ads?imt=1&utm_campaign=Date+Range+Picker&utm_source=Site+Ads&utm_medium=Banner&utm_content=Blog+Demo+Image
[05:44:04] <JJjack> for div id daterange
[07:22:56] <javas> do bootstrap have component for close when clicking outside div?
[08:09:56] <hhee> guys, is jquery UI - widely used?
[08:13:07] <Cork> depends on you're definition of widely
[08:13:22] <Cork> but ye, it is fairly well known lib
[08:19:03] <Caspan> i have a document ready that fires that works fine. I am doing Ajax calls to change content so is there an onchange function so when ajax calls are made i can run these events again?
[08:19:29] <Caspan> or do i jsut need to run these events after i run my ajax calls
[08:22:14] <Caspan> $(document).change(function() {})
[08:22:20] <Caspan> would that work?
[08:23:57] <Cork> Caspan: ajax doesn't affect .ready at all
[08:24:06] <Cork> .ready is for when the document is loaded
[08:24:23] <Cork> it is there so if you put code inside the head it will wait for the body to be parsed
[08:24:42] <Caspan> $(document).on('change', '.AjaxHTML', function() {
[08:24:42] <Caspan>  });
[08:24:45] <Cork> ajax doesn't have head so there is no point of .ready
[08:24:46] <Caspan> I used this insted
[08:25:11] <Caspan> that way when my Modal changes HTML inside it fires the code again
[08:25:36] <Cork> well more like it won't affect the listener, but ya, that is the correct way to do it
[08:25:43] <Caspan> I am just learning Ajax and one of those things is realizing my selectors that ran on Document ready dont apply to newly called HTML
[08:26:26] <Cork> well they do, but the selectors generate a result ( $()) and .on is later then looping that result list and adding listeners to each one of them
[08:26:50] <Cork> as when you replace the content with ajax, it creates new dom elements, so they don't have any listeners
[08:27:07] <Cork> delegated event handlers on the other hand binds to a static parent
[08:27:12] <Cork> and listen for bubbling events
[08:27:20] <Caspan> ahh okay
[08:27:28] <Caspan> thats neat
[08:27:32] <Cork> Caspan: btw, you might want to replace $(document) with the closest static parent
[08:27:45] <Cork> instead of listning to every change event on the page
[08:27:58] <Caspan> is that not what the input field is for
[08:28:05] <Caspan> if i change that to .class of my modal
[08:28:11] <Caspan> it will only listen to that
[08:28:24] <Cork> what happens with $(document).on('change', '.AjaxHTML'
[08:28:28] <Cork> is: it selects the document
[08:28:34] <Cork> and binds an on change handler on it
[08:28:44] <Caspan> yeah
[08:28:46] <Caspan> i get you
[08:28:58] <Cork> and then listens for what original element the event has bubbled from
[08:29:14] <Cork> and if that element is matching the selector fires your handles
[08:29:17] <Caspan> $('.modal').on('change', '.modal-content', function() {
[08:29:19] <Caspan> thats better
[08:29:22] <Cork> yup
[08:29:34] <Caspan> thanks
[08:29:37] <Caspan> great point
[08:29:42] <Cork> as long as .modal isn't too many elements though :)
[08:29:50] <Caspan> 3 elements
[08:29:54] <Cork> that's find
[08:29:56] <Cork> *fine
[08:30:19] <Cork> if it had been like 100 you would have slowed down the page cause of the extra work the browser would have to do to manage the handlers
[08:30:21] <Caspan> actually then its just as easy to fire the selector when i call the ajax in this case
[08:30:37] <Caspan> jsut as easy and dont have to worry about excess fires
[08:30:48] <Cork> ya
[08:31:00] <Cork> don't involve event handlers unless you don't know the case your self
[08:31:07] <Caspan> because the HTML returned will have lots of elements
[08:31:09] <Cork> (like user input)
[08:32:52] <Caspan> is there any harm in firing a selector on Document ready and then again later?
[08:33:16] <Cork> what do you mean bu fireing a selector?
[08:33:21] <Caspan> does it replace the selectors with the new ones, does it add to the current selectors?
[08:33:22] <Cork> *by
[08:33:26] <Cork> no
[08:33:39] <Caspan> $('.MakeMeSearchable').chosen({});
[08:33:51] <Caspan> sorry i call it firing a selector
[08:33:51] <Cork> if you want to update the page without losing the event handlers us delegated event handlers
[08:33:55] <Cork> don't bind them over and over again
[08:34:26] <Caspan> i run this on document.ready
[08:34:37] <Cork> (don't paste it in the channel)
[08:34:40] <Caspan> but i need it to find my newly added drop downs i jsut added
[08:34:40] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[08:34:59] <Cork> Caspan: why do you need to find it?
[08:35:12] <Caspan> its a jquery add on
[08:35:22] <Caspan> that makes my drop down selectors serachable
[08:35:24] <Cork> ok, make a jsfiddle with the ajax code
[08:36:18] <Caspan> because the edit page i am loading is loaded via AJAX the new HTML does not have listeners on their dropdowns
[08:36:42] <Cork> Caspan: like i just said, you shouldn't rebind the listeners
[08:36:46] <Cork> delegate them to a static parent
[08:37:05] <Caspan> humm
[08:37:34] <Caspan> trying to think how I would do that in my case
[08:37:50] <Caspan> It would have to be added at the very top
[08:38:01] <Cork> like i said, make a jsfiddle with the related code
[08:38:28] <Caspan> ill try but there is so much extra code for other stuff it would not work :)
[08:38:29] <Caspan> ill try
[08:38:42] <Cork> Caspan: i don't want a working fiddle
[08:38:54] <Cork> i need the part where you bind the event handlers related to this
[08:38:56] <Cork> and the ajax call
[08:39:00] <Caspan> okay
[08:39:09] <Cork> and the dom structure where the select elements are
[08:39:20] <Cork> but not "everything"
[08:39:25] <Cork> just so i can see what parents they have
[08:39:32] <Caspan> http://pastebin.com/QBbhtaWr
[08:39:44] <Cork> jsfiddle.net please
[08:39:48] <Caspan> so that is what gets called when you select an item to modif
[08:41:00] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/89j1751v/
[08:41:23] <Cork> ah, chosen isn't an event listener
[08:41:23] <Caspan> there is a catagory and a money jar drop down i want to make searchable
[08:41:35] <Cork> its a plugin, so it most likely modifies the dom structure when you call it
[08:41:46] <Caspan> yes
[08:41:46] <Cork> so ya, those needs to be executed for each element
[08:41:47] <Caspan> sorry
[08:42:04] <Cork> hmm
[08:42:13] <Caspan> it a jquery plug in someone created that modifies the drop down
[08:42:20] <Cork> but you're replacing everything in #ModalHTML
[08:42:27] <Cork> so there won't be anything else in there
[08:42:49] <Caspan> #ModalHTML is normally empty
[08:42:59] <Caspan> it only has a loagin animation in it
[08:43:01] <Cork> wasn't exactly what i meant; but what ever
[08:43:10] <Caspan> then once Ajax is called its replaced by the edit HTML
[08:43:24] <Cork> Caspan: https://jsfiddle.net/89j1751v/1/ should work
[08:44:09] <MassDebates> So i've got a form
[08:44:11] <MassDebates> And uh
[08:44:19] <Caspan> Cork: what did you change?
[08:44:20] <MassDebates> yeah there's like inputs n stuff in there.
[08:44:32] <Cork> Caspan: check after the .html(result)
[08:44:53] <MassDebates> I want to be able to save the webpage with the form's user-inputted values intact.
[08:45:01] <Caspan> ahh you are finding new items under the selector
[08:45:03] <Caspan> cool
[08:45:13] <MassDebates> And I want to give the user a link to click to do this. How do I accomplish that?
[08:45:35] <Cork> MassDebates: do you know web development at all?
[08:46:06] <Caspan> Cork: thank you that worked perfect
[08:46:11] <Cork> Caspan: yw
[08:46:32] <Caspan> So i added listiners only to items under the New HTML added
[08:46:42] <Caspan> what woudl happen if i ran that selector twice?
[08:46:48] <Caspan> on the whole document?
[08:47:09] <Caspan> MassDebates: do you even internet?
[08:47:11] <Cork> Caspan: you would get two selectors on every element that existed in both situations
[08:47:29] <Caspan> which would be bad
[08:47:56] <Caspan> perfect thank you
[08:48:13] <Caspan> no i can make that ugly table look nice
[08:48:21] <Caspan> now*
[08:49:24] <Caspan> if only there was a jquery plug in that just made a page look nice :)
[08:49:36] <Caspan> im a programmer not a designer
[08:52:15] <slax0r> then hire a designer
[09:19:35] <MassDebates> I'm back, sorry. And Caspan I internet
[09:19:47] <MassDebates> Cork:  yes I do.
[09:19:47] <Caspan> MassDebates: im buggin
[09:20:07] <MassDebates> Excuse me?
[09:20:20] <Caspan> MassDebates: so you want to save a users input from a form
[09:20:37] <Caspan> they click submit and you get to keep the data
[09:21:13] <Caspan> or are you saying you want to capture a copy of the DOM with the users input in the fields?
[09:23:31] <MassDebates> I'll be honest I can have the guys work on whatever integration is necessary after, I would like whatever is easiest for the users. These are sales guys that are anywhere between 30 and 75 years old with a high demographic concentration between 47-62 years old.
[09:24:10] <MassDebates> These men are not fluid with a mobile device, but their managers are demanding that they start using this because of incredible high costs with sales forms and the carbon paper. Digital would drop our costs significantly.
[09:24:32] <Caspan> you need them to fill out a form to capture data corrrect ?
[09:24:41] <MassDebates> The tablets are in the custody and care of the sales personnel. I would prefer the ability to manage the process without internet access being required.
[09:24:46] <MassDebates> And yes, I need to capture the data.
[09:25:15] <Caspan> so you need an app then
[09:25:19] <MassDebates> I don't mind if it's saved in an assumably dedicated directory on the tablet itself or if it's handled otherwise, but I do have preferences to complete the operation without internet access required.
[09:25:25] <Caspan> if no internet then dont bother with web
[09:25:37] <Caspan> not a jquery thing
[09:25:46] <Caspan> you need to develop an app
[09:25:54] <mar77i> so uh
[09:25:58] <MassDebates> I would like to stay away from an app. I'm looking at doing a webapp that runs on its own with directory dependencies leveraged with it. Cost is a factor for the firm.
[09:26:24] <Caspan> jquerry is still not what you are looking for
[09:26:30] <Caspan> you are talking basick web programming
[09:26:42] <Caspan> #php
[09:27:00] <MassDebates> Running or emulating a server stack is cost prohibitive and not the simplest way to solve the task.
[09:27:29] <Caspan> MassDebates: This is not a jquery question or solution
[09:27:29] <MassDebates> Again, a lightweight library (maybe not even jquery) to handle basic interactions would be ideal.
[09:28:02] <Caspan> your starting in the middle you need to start at the beginning
[09:28:09] <MassDebates> I would like the opinion of someone who knows the proper role that async plays when interacting with the DOM.
[09:28:12] <mar77i> I'm fading images in and out, and I just noticed, that visibility:hidden actually lets me read the image's size, but [img.width(), img.height()] seems to be always 0, 0 as long as display: none is set
[09:28:28] <MassDebates> Apologies, Caspan - no offense.
[09:28:42] <Caspan> that is the only thing you could do with no web server
[09:28:44] <Caspan> make HTML
[09:28:49] <MassDebates> And jquery.
[09:28:51] <Caspan> have the user type in the document
[09:28:56] <MassDebates> Yes, client-side languages.
[09:29:24] <Caspan> then click a button that copies the DOM replaing the values in the field as a default value for that field and save it as an HTML
[09:29:35] <Caspan> that way whne you ope the html file it will have the values in the field
[09:30:07] <Caspan> then you collect the HTML files form the tablet
[09:30:24] <MassDebates> Caspan:  Are you familiar with form data when an HTML document is saved from the browser?
[09:30:41] <MassDebates> Caspan:  Do you know the complications with the discard of data that has been inputted?
[09:30:42] <Caspan> well normally you Post it
[09:30:45] <Caspan> to a server
[09:30:47] <MassDebates> Again
[09:30:49] <MassDebates> Caspan:  Do you know the complications with the discard of data that has been inputted?
[09:30:53] <Caspan> you could parse it in JS insted
[09:31:00] <MassDebates> Cork:  still there?
[09:31:04] <MassDebates> or anyone?
[09:31:32] <Caspan> Not saying it cannot be done
[09:31:58] <Duikb00t> When I have let's say 10 fields (input) with name="jquery[]"
[09:32:01] <Caspan> but what i suggested is simple and fast
[09:32:16] <MassDebates> Caspan:  Show me an exmaple of what you're talking about with jsfiddle, then.
[09:32:16] <Caspan> or you can parse the form and save it to a text file
[09:32:19] <Duikb00t> How can I check the in an onchange event with element is currently active?
[09:32:26] <Duikb00t> *active*
[09:32:28] <Caspan> MassDebates: nope, im not write code for you :)
[09:32:32] <Duikb00t> On wich element I am currently
[09:32:39] <MassDebates> Caspan:  That's odd. I wrote plenty of code for you in the past with #css
[09:32:49] <MassDebates> When others have accused you of asking for spoonfeeding because you're a 'help vampire'
[09:32:55] <Duikb00t> $target = $(e.target);  this is cool and works well but how do I know wich from the 10 fields I am working on.
[09:33:05] <Duikb00t> $target = $(e.target.*NTH* element orsomething);
[09:33:07] <Duikb00t> index?
[09:33:08] <Caspan> MassDebates: You are asking me to write the entire project for you
[09:33:14] <MassDebates> It's okay though. The reason why I wanted an example was for you to demonstrate that you actually know what you're talking about. I didn't need my solution created for me.
[09:33:17] <Cork> Duikb00t: by active you mean focused?
[09:33:43] <Caspan> i dont need to write code to prove it, want a second opinoin get one
[09:33:49] <MassDebates> Doing so.
[09:33:52] <Caspan> im jsut stating my knowledge
[09:34:00] <Caspan> take it if you want
[09:34:05] <MassDebates> Caspan:  Do you know the complications with the discard of data that has been inputted?
[09:34:08] <Duikb00t> Cork:  correct.
[09:34:33] <Cork> Duikb00t: the focused element (doesn't have to be the same element the event is fired on) is document.activeElement
[09:34:37] <Caspan> MassDebates: no idea what you are asking
[09:34:45] <Caspan> are you taking about parsing data form the input fields
[09:35:02] <Duikb00t> thanks you Cork
[09:35:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: e.target is the event source, doesn't have to be the element you're after if you want the element the handler is bound on
[09:35:04] <MassDebates> How is that not implied? Yes.
[09:35:15] <Caspan> NM good luck
[09:35:19] <MassDebates> Thanks
[09:35:24] <Cork> Duikb00t: click on an <a> element is the best example of where that will break
[09:37:21] <MassDebates> For anyone qualified to answer, I've gone ahead and created a webapp that uses async to create new form elements dynamically. I'm working on a script that recreates the form as it is with a loop and counter (because I don't know of a more efficient and cleaner way to do so - jquery isn't my forte)  and then inserts the inputted values into HTML att
[09:37:21] <MassDebates> ributes (specifically the 'value' attribute)
[09:37:38] <MassDebates> I don't like this and I want it to be better. How can I accomplish this?
[09:37:55] <MassDebates> If needed, I can port stuff from localhost to a codepen, but it'll take me a bit of time.
[09:39:37] <MassDebates> If anyone has enough experience and knowledge to answer, please include my name so I get the ping - I will respond quickly but I have a flight at 1PM and a meeting from 11AM-11:45AM. Currently is 9:39AM so you can use timestamps on the IRC to help with timing,.
[09:39:49] <MassDebates> Appreciate any effective assistance!
[09:43:49] <Caspan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27398074/saving-a-data-from-html-form-to-text-file-with-jquery-javascript
[09:44:13] <Caspan> if you want to validate form information you'll have to use JS
[09:44:33] <Caspan> let us know if you have trouble writing the code
[09:45:00] <MassDebates> I want to make the way it processes each successive input element cleaner.
[09:45:14] <MassDebates> A very useful google search, though. That brought me to the results I've gotten so far.
[09:45:48] <Caspan> okay so you have a for with 5 input fields
[09:45:51] <Caspan> form
[09:45:52] <MassDebates> I just made a folder and threw in the source code in there, threw in a folder for a dest directory and threw in a folder for dependencies, of which the jquery lib is the only one. About to add another for our IT dept''s security (req'd)
[09:46:22] <MassDebates> I don't have trouble dealing with those logistics. I just want to make the way it processes each new successive input better.
[09:46:31] <Caspan> and when th euser hits submit you want to validate the form fields then save it correct?
[09:46:33] <MassDebates> Did you catch my previous statement about how I'm managing this currently?
[09:46:42] <MassDebates> No validation.
[09:47:15] <Caspan> Caspan:  Do you know the complications with the discard of data that has been inputted?
[09:47:24] <MassDebates> Yes.
[09:47:25] <Caspan> what do you mean by that statement then
[09:47:52] <MassDebates> I mean that I'm currently handling it in a very ugly, text-based way. I don't know if this can be improved because my experience with development doesn't hit many client side languages.
[09:48:24] <MassDebates> And yes, I'd love to do it with PHP and I'd love to just put it on our website and give sales guys access to a hidden, protected page on their already secured accounts, but this has been deemed too much of a path..
[09:48:46] <MassDebates> They want something avaible on the tablet's home-screen. So i'm doing that. They want something that doesn't need internet access, so I'm doing that.
[09:48:51] <mar77i> MassDebates: sorry if this might be off topic, but I must ask you: show me your weapons.
[09:49:09] <MassDebates> Well right now it just takes a count of what it loops through
[09:49:16] <MassDebates> Makes it into a json file
[09:49:19] <MassDebates> and then recreates the form
[09:49:24] <Caspan> but I still dont get what you mean by your statement "the complications with the discard of data that has been inputted?"
[09:49:28] <MassDebates> And inputs "value" attributes by what it gets
[09:49:29] <Caspan> why do you want to discard the data
[09:49:45] <Caspan> okay
[09:49:56] <MassDebates> Since this is the only way I know how to skip the drop of the inputted data, I did this. I want to make it better. Does anyone have an answer to my question or no?
[09:50:19] <MassDebates> I don't mind waiting for someone who knows, I'd rather not waste my time with those who don't. (example: if you're googling to find out the answer right now, I'm not interested.)
[09:50:21] <Caspan> refresh the browser page?
[09:50:34] <Caspan> seriously
[09:50:40] <MassDebates> Screw it. I'm keeping it as it is.
[09:50:43] <MassDebates> Thanks guys.
[09:50:44] <Caspan> the form is brand new again
[09:50:58] <Caspan> if you dont know what your looking for it might be hard to find it
[09:51:06] <Caspan> if your talking about clearing a form thats simple
[09:51:11] <FilipNortic_> well it's really hard to know what you mean... But setting a json file and stetinga timneout that wirtes current input to it is easy
[09:51:12] <MassDebates> It's hard to help people if you don't know what you're talking about Caspan
[09:51:42] <MassDebates> FilipNortic:  Is there a better way to capture the data than scrolling through every input element and dumping contents to a text file to recreate a webpage with those attributes?
[09:51:47] <MassDebates> Ohps, forgot underscore
[09:51:53] <FilipNortic_> when loading the json file at page load isn't hard either
[09:51:54] <MassDebates> FilipNortic_:  Is there a better way to capture the data than scrolling through every input element and dumping contents to a text file to recreate a webpage with those attributes?
[09:52:22] <MassDebates> Or no?
[09:52:30] <FilipNortic_> have them in aform and replace onsubmit with a custum handler
[09:52:43] <MassDebates> yes thats what I have right now
[09:52:46] <FilipNortic_> and make sure you preventDefault so page dosen't reload
[09:52:48] <MassDebates> to trigger the save process
[09:52:59] <FilipNortic_> preventDefault()
[09:53:57] <MassDebates> okay
[09:54:44] <MassDebates> I've found preventDefautl to be useful for 'starting' this 'save' process I made - The user knows nothing better - they hit a 'save' link and it runs the script
[09:54:59] <MassDebates> Then I dropped the whole submit thing and just made the link start the script
[09:55:15] <MassDebates> is there a better way to extract this data?
[09:55:25] <MassDebates> For example:
[09:55:26] <FilipNortic_> $("#yourform).submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault()... ajax(submithere)}
[09:55:43] <MassDebates> perfect
[09:55:43] <MassDebates> Thanks
[09:55:50] <MassDebates> Thank you FilipNortic_
[09:55:55] <FilipNortic_> write it to some json file or something then on page load just load the ajax file
[09:56:01] <MassDebates> yeah.
[09:57:03] <FilipNortic_> you can event do setTimeout( function(){$("#form").trigger("submit")}, 20000)
[09:57:14] <FilipNortic_> or somthing like that later
[09:58:56] <MikeD_> imo, using setTimeout to trigger a submit smells very wrong
[09:58:58] <Caspan> if i am using the Jquery UI ate picker any one know the only componets i need
[09:59:04] <Caspan> Date Picker*
[09:59:32] <Caspan> I am assuming Datepicker but wandering if that alone will make it look nice
[09:59:52] <MikeD_> "nice" is so subjective, i'm betting the answer will be no.
[10:00:42] <AntonioRibeiro> $.ajaxComplete() is failing with a 200 after $.getJSON() with a valid json, is there anything missing here?
[10:00:59] <MikeD_> 200 isn't a fail
[10:01:10] <AntonioRibeiro> yup, I know, but stil...
[10:01:19] <Caspan> MikeD_: yes I agree just never used UI before and was not sure if i have to load templating componets to add more then jsut a basic flat look
[10:01:38] <AntonioRibeiro> I have .done() and .fail() and it goes to fail
[10:01:48] <MassDebates> #CSS makes it more than just a basic flat lok
[10:01:52] <FilipNortic_> MikeD_: sort of yeah but every dog has it's day.. you could extracrt a write to file function from the submit handler and just run that though, it will be the same
[10:01:53] <MassDebates> Or you can roll your own theme.
[10:02:09] <AdamPDotty> never used an UI before, ui
[10:02:19] <Caspan> MassDebates: Thanks do you use jquerry UI?
[10:02:22] <MassDebates> Yes.
[10:02:30] <MassDebates> Would you like an example?
[10:02:34] <Caspan> nope
[10:02:36] <MassDebates> (of the datepicker being used with a rolled theme)
[10:02:39] <MassDebates> Oh, okay :)
[10:02:54] <Caspan> canned theme is what im looking for
[10:03:03] <MassDebates> They have those in the directory.
[10:03:11] <Caspan> never used UI so dont know if you have to selectect another componet to get some canned themes
[10:03:12] <MassDebates> I think theres anywhere between 12-24 of them.
[10:03:17] <MikeD_> "canned theme" and "looks nice" are rarely ever in the same sentence
[10:03:26] <MassDebates> um MikeD_
[10:03:32] <MassDebates> You're discounting the entire canned food industry.
[10:03:34] <Caspan> MikeD_: it Jquery UI :)
[10:03:37] <Caspan> its*
[10:03:39] <MassDebates> Progresso has a great Canned Theme and it looks nice.
[10:03:47] <MassDebates> Boomsha.
[10:04:02] <Caspan> NM im an idiot
[10:04:06] <MassDebates> No you're not.
[10:04:13] <Caspan> right at the bottom of the download page is a theme selector
[10:04:18] <MikeD_> You went progresso, even though Andy Warhol painted a Campbell's can?
[10:04:23] <MassDebates> Um
[10:04:28] <MassDebates> That's an entirely different canned theme
[10:04:32] <MassDebates> And I honestly think it's ugly af
[10:04:47] <MikeD_> that proves my point about subjective meaning of "nice looking"
[10:04:58] <Caspan> i could not find it in the componets how you chose the theme
[10:05:15] <MassDebates> Did you look in the "nice" section
[10:05:31] <MikeD_> i'm not flying to france for a theme roller
[10:05:49] <FilipNortic_> that's why i'm not a designer when I think it looks nice everybody else just cringes
[10:06:10] <MikeD_> you need radius corners and gradient backgrounds
[10:06:23] <MassDebates> No, you need obtrusively thick and noticeable box-shadows.
[10:06:25] <MikeD_> and the darkest black you should use is #444
[10:06:41] <MikeD_> yeah, box shadows ftw
[10:07:03] * ExtraSteve just walked into a conversation about soup can design
[10:07:07] * ExtraSteve walks back out
[10:07:07] <MikeD_> fortunately the content reflection fad has mostly gone away
[10:07:14] <MassDebates> Be sure to include bells and whistles that you find are neat gimmicks that actually impede the flow and usage of the UI, too. This is jquery-ui, after all.
[10:07:23] <MassDebates> LOL MIKED
[10:07:29] <MassDebates> that's unfortunate
[10:07:33] <MassDebates> xD
[10:07:39] <MassDebates> hahahahahaha
[10:07:43] <MikeD_> why open when you can animate?
[10:08:01] <MassDebates> WHY CAN IT WHEN YOU CAN OPEN IT
[10:08:11] <MassDebates> D'ohoohoh.
[10:08:33] <MikeD_> i've wondered why animate doesn't have a sound effect parameter
[10:08:43] <MassDebates> Dear god
[10:08:48] <MikeD_> the series of tubes needs more 'whooshing'
[10:08:49] <MassDebates> I'm not even going to shitpost about that one.
[10:09:31] <MikeD_> or you know, a "shnick." and the "schling!" sounds are very popular
[10:10:02] <MassDebates> I mean, I'm an asshole
[10:10:10] <MassDebates> but merely suggesting these things is pure evil
[10:10:23] <MikeD_> haha
[10:10:30] <MassDebates> Not that I mind. I'm just warning you of the fiery doom that awaits you after death
[10:10:48] <MikeD_> I keep Rokko's Basilisk as a pet
[10:11:03] <MassDebates> Oh sweetheart you ain't seen nothing yet
[10:11:14] <MassDebates> I don't know what that is but I can tell you
[10:11:26] <MassDebates> I've had to debug audio slideshows
[10:11:35] <MikeD_> https://www.google.com/#q=roko%27s+basilisk
[10:11:36] <Caspan> just realizing the component page is intelligent it will add the dependencies for components you select, very nice
[10:11:36] <MassDebates> I've been there with sound.
[10:11:38] <MassDebates> You don't want sound.
[10:11:57] <MikeD_> I know i don't want sound... most of the time I don't even want color.
[10:12:27] <MassDebates> I honestly 100% agree with that.
[10:12:36] <MassDebates> At least at the start if there's no branding to be concerned with.
[10:12:48] <MassDebates> All the time when people are designing stuff, they look at me like I'm crazy when I say
[10:12:55] <MassDebates> "make everything monocrhome right now. tell me what you see."
[10:13:08] <MassDebates> "now design every new layout in monochrome, and THEN add color when you're done"
[10:13:34] <MassDebates> And yet, still, they're amazed every time when their UI comes out ridiculously better.
[10:13:56] <MassDebates> I don't see why accessibility is just ignored.
[10:14:06] <MikeD_> for the same reason, I suggest turning off the CSS to find the functional problems with bullshit HTML
[10:14:58] <MassDebates> That's a good parallel to make. I often found myself slicing out rules rapidly when debugging people's #css problems
[10:15:11] <MikeD_> semantic markup is a beautiful thing even without cosmetics of css
[10:15:36] <MassDebates> Er, I have to disagree. CSS now plays a necessary role in fulfilling user expectation and familiarity needs.
[10:15:57] <MikeD_> http://css-naked-day.github.io/
[10:16:02] <MassDebates> In the past? I'd totally be with you. But there's too many fancy dancy professionals who cop-out with a lack of design because they feel it looks better.
[10:17:01] <MikeD_> i'm a professional but I've grown tired of "fancy dancy"
[10:17:13] <SpecialTech> Would a window.$.get() affect a form submit?
[10:19:07] <SpecialTech> I'm using get() to retrieve data from a different page, but on that same page, there is a form - and when I submit on that form, it just redirects me back to the original page.
[10:23:28] <MikeD_> fwiw, i wasn't suggesting that sites not use css... i was suggesting that developers know/appreciate markup before they cover a world of sin under heavy use of css
[10:24:51] <MikeD_> divitis should be treated like alcoholism... but maybe i'm being mean?
[10:25:04] <MikeD_> (mean... to alcoholics)
[10:25:48] <Uhkis> divitis?
[10:26:49] <MikeD_> http://www.apaddedcell.com/div-itis-what-it-and-how-avoid-it
[10:27:40] <taplar> -_-
[10:29:04] <Caspan> so i have installed Jquerry UI JS file and CSS file and i have tried to use the dat picker and nothing happens
[10:29:11] <Caspan> date picker*
[10:29:31] <Caspan> i click and console show no errors but also no date picker shows up
[10:29:33] <taplar> show us what you are trying?
[10:29:50] <Caspan> taplar: 2 seconds
[10:33:50] <Caspan> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/e2uy5dof/
[10:34:29] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e2uy5dof/2/
[10:34:33] <Caspan> sorry few changes
[10:34:54] <MikeD_> you have to add the library in the javascript settings
[10:35:07] <Caspan> ??
[10:35:10] <Caspan> its added
[10:35:12] <Caspan> is it not
[10:35:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e2uy5dof/3/
[10:35:22] <Caspan> jquerry UI and jquerry are both loaded
[10:36:02] <Caspan> what did i do wrong?
[10:36:19] <MikeD_> now it 'works' for a limited definition of works
[10:36:23] <taplar> i took out the 3.1.1 external import and included 2.4.4 in the javascript area
[10:36:26] <AdamPDotty> alcohol?
[10:36:30] <ExtraSteve> Don't you need to add jqueryui css?
[10:36:32] <MikeD_> if/when you click into the date, you get the calendar
[10:36:50] <taplar> ExtraSteve: only to make it look right, ;)
[10:36:50] <Caspan> wonder what i had in there
[10:37:46] <taplar> either the jqueryui file was loading before the 3.1.1 jquery file, or, the jqueryui file you had was not compatible with 3.1.1
[10:43:02] <taplar> Dropped jQuery 1.6.x support: jQuery UI 1.12 officially supports jQuery 1.7.0 – 3.1.0. <-- from the blog
[10:59:12] <Caspan> ahh
[10:59:24] <Caspan> time to update my jq library
[11:00:21] <AdamPDotty> composer update
[11:04:58] <tocka> Hi guys, im trying to get a value outside of $.window but Im having no luck.. Is this not possible? http://pastebin.com/v27b8ELH
[11:06:40] <taplar> take off the var in the handler
[11:06:43] <taplar> that make it local
[11:07:33] <tocka> taplar you mean in the $(window) ?
[11:07:43] <taplar> line 4
[11:08:17] <tocka> thanks :)
[11:11:13] <SpecialTech> taplar - would a window.$.get() affect a form submit button?
[11:11:43] <taplar> not by itself
[11:20:40] <Caspan> taplar: okay so still having an issues getting it to show
[11:20:47] <Caspan> the date window
[11:20:57] <Caspan> if i put an input box in my HTML
[11:21:09] <Caspan> and i call the selector on document.ready it works fine
[11:21:46] <Caspan> but I am using a modal to load my edit form so the HTML that has the dat selector is loaded later
[11:22:08] <taplar> you will have to initialize it when it is available
[11:22:12] <Caspan> i am calling the $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();  after my ajax call but it wont work still
[11:22:20] <taplar> 'after'?
[11:22:40] <Caspan> well let me paste
[11:22:42] <Caspan> 2 seconds
[11:23:05] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e2uy5dof/5/
[11:23:10] <Caspan> if you look at that
[11:23:13] <MACscr> i need to be able to use draggable() and resizable() on the same element. How can I do that? Ive created a very basic example here https://jsfiddle.net/11u2w0nr/
[11:23:17] <Caspan> ther eis a modifyForm that gets called
[11:23:19] <MACscr> i can resize fine, but not drag
[11:23:39] <Caspan> it makes my modal show up and the data put into it
[11:23:52] <taplar> I assume line 10 is the ajax to load the modal?
[11:23:58] <Caspan> yes
[11:24:12] <taplar> and you understand that ajax requests are asynchronous, right?
[11:24:18] <Caspan> yes
[11:24:23] <taplar> so what does that mean?
[11:24:38] <Caspan> that my selector is running before the dom is ready
[11:24:42] <Caspan> ?
[11:24:51] <taplar> before your ajax finishes
[11:25:04] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e2uy5dof/6/
[11:25:14] <Caspan> so i need to place it inside the success
[11:25:18] <Caspan> ahh
[11:25:19] <taplar> yes
[11:25:20] <Caspan> duh
[11:25:37] <Caspan> let me try that
[11:26:22] <Caspan> yeah that did it
[11:26:27] <Caspan> you are a very good teacher...
[11:26:52] <Caspan> thank you for not just giving me the answer but helping me to see it instead!
[11:27:00] <taplar> :) what we are here for
[11:27:02] <Caspan> teach a man to fish!
[11:34:05] <Caspan> is there a format for the date to add  the ending to dates like 1st, 2nd, 3rd ?
[11:34:12] <Caspan> i dont see it one the format page
[11:34:17] <Caspan> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate
[11:34:52] <taplar> ?
[11:35:00] <Caspan> that way you can have December 5th, 2016
[11:35:05] <Caspan> more redable date
[11:35:14] <Caspan> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker({altFormat: "MM d, yy"});
[11:35:23] <Caspan> that will show December 15, 2016
[11:35:48] <Caspan> i want to add the (st|rd|nd) to the ends fo the nubmers
[11:35:52] <taplar> i feel like that should exist, but i don't know it off hand
[11:36:13] <Caspan> i jstu didnt see it on the list so ill assume it does not exist
[11:36:44] <Caspan> ill deal with it :)
[11:37:51] <Caspan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8199204/adding-st-nd-rd-th-to-jquery-datepicker
[11:37:56] <Caspan> looks liek it does not have it
[11:38:14] <taplar> boo
[11:43:55] <relipse> is it possible to mark all checkboxes with value "No" only After a certain text?
[11:44:18] <taplar> after a certain text?
[11:44:56] <relipse> <input type="checkbox" value="No"><h2>AfterThis</h2><input type="checkbox" value="No">
[11:45:19] <relipse> $('input[type=checkbox][value=No]').prop('checked', true); will do everything
[11:45:29] <taplar> sure, but it will be ugly
[11:45:36] <relipse> ugly is ok
[11:45:39] <taplar> can you give the certain text a class or something?
[11:45:53] <relipse> no can't change html
[11:45:59] <taplar> :(
[11:46:26] <taplar> then select the h2's, filter by the innerHTML, and then find the next() that has a value of "No"
[11:46:59] <relipse> so basically find the h2 and go next() over all the elements ?
[11:47:42] <relipse> and then call .find() for all of them?
[11:48:10] <taplar> no, not find at the end
[11:48:59] <taplar> $('h2').filter( filter those that have the AfterThis text ).next( function to select only checkboxes with a value of "No" ).prop('checked', true);
[11:49:11] <mike_papa> I have an event: $myElement.on('click', function(e) { ... });. How do I exclude that event from myElement child?
[11:49:51] <taplar> mike_papa: either bind on the child and stopPropagation, or in that event check the e.target to see if it was the child or not
[11:51:26] <relipse> taplar what about this: http://hastebin.com/evakafoqof.lua
[11:51:45] <taplar> does it work?
[11:51:50] <relipse> not sure
[11:53:19] <mike_papa> taplar: Ok, so if I do $elementChild.on('click', function (e) { e.stopPropagation() }); I will actually disable it's parent's events? I'm still noob in that field, and don't really get that propagation thing.
[11:53:50] <taplar> stopPropagation keeps the event from bubbling up through it's parents
[11:56:07] <mike_papa> taplar: So only click event (in this case) attached to this element will trigger, but no click events attached to any of parents?
[11:56:33] <taplar> no, it stops the click events originating from that element or child elements
[11:56:55] <taplar> any event that does not originate from that child, but on another child of the parent, or the parent itself, can still process
[11:58:03] <taplar> are you familiar with a tree structure?
[11:58:31] <mike_papa> taplar: Yes. more or less.
[11:59:20] <taplar> ok, so what you are doing it attaching an event handler to one of the child nodes in the tree
[11:59:47] <taplar> and you are saying any event that comes from branches spouting off of that node, or that node itself, should not continue up the tree further
[11:59:57] <taplar> it only affects that branch, no other branch
[12:04:40] <mike_papa> taplar: But from what you say, I understand that I should use stopPropagation on event attached to parent, while using it on child actually stopped parent's event from triggering in my case.
[12:05:22] <taplar> if the event originates from that child, yes it will not fire that event on the parent
[12:09:53] <mike_papa> taplar: Ok. So in this example: https://jsfiddle.net/1h4yezLz/ Where do I use stopPropagation, so clicking "+" link will not expand list?
[12:11:05] <mike_papa> Updated one line: https://jsfiddle.net/1h4yezLz/1/
[12:12:00] <taplar> you don't want the + to expand the list?
[12:13:56] <taplar> you would stopPropagation on that link then
[12:19:10] <tocka> hi guys :)
[12:19:26] <tocka> how could I update each value in the object by the key?
[12:19:31] <tocka> thats what im trying to do now
[12:19:44] <tocka> but it only adds new fieldName item
[12:19:45] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/L7HUMtBa
[12:22:25] <MACscr> tocka jsfiddle
[12:22:35] <tocka> fixed it :> needed []

[14:31:32] <rethus> I have a page, there is no jquery loaded, but if I enter $('#estV') in browser-console, the div with this ID will be returned.
[14:31:46] <robertmaxrees> lemme guess -you're using chrome.
[14:32:04] <rethus> How could this be? Does Browser also have the $('<ID>') way to access elements?
[14:32:08] <rethus> chrome and midori
[14:32:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah - that's a browser convenience in the console.
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> it's document.querySelectorAll
[14:32:50] <rethus> even on firefox
[14:32:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[14:33:26] <rethus> ok, but this won't work inside of the html sourcecode, right.. it's only a browser-console thing, right
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:33:44] <rethus> ^^ I was really wondering whats going on here :)
[14:37:19] <taplar> font awesome is wicked.  they finally implemented icon stacking, :)
[14:40:42] <AntonioRibeiro> can you see anything wrong here?
[14:40:43] <AntonioRibeiro> https://bpaste.net/show/577fc227480f
[14:41:07] <AntonioRibeiro> I get a "getJSON fail"
[14:41:50] <AntonioRibeiro> But the response looks fine, its a 200.
[14:42:02] <taplar> is it valid json?
[14:42:22] <AntonioRibeiro> yes, according to lint
[14:43:09] <taplar> dunno, have you tried doing a normal get to the url and then try to JSON.parse(data) to see if that errors too?
[14:43:26] <AntonioRibeiro> will do
[14:43:29] <taplar> side note, passing in {format: "json"} seems unnecessary
[14:44:06] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, that's a third party plugin code actually, but I'm trying to debug it...
[14:44:07] <taplar> or is that a parameter for the backend?
[14:44:10] <taplar> ah
[14:52:59] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, by doing console.log(JSON.parse(failed.responseText)), I see an object and no errors
[14:53:25] <taplar> so your get is also going into the fail logic?
[14:53:49] <AntonioRibeiro> yes
[14:53:58] <AntonioRibeiro> going to the fail with no apparent reason
[14:55:10] <taplar> and it is a 200 in the dev tools
[14:57:03] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar: https://i.imgur.com/ydYFzHp.png
[14:57:59] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, yes, but type is not application/json, it is xhr
[14:58:00] <taplar> not sure then.  i'd have to see a working example
[14:58:54] <AntonioRibeiro> That's where it gets weird, it works outside the app
[14:59:19] <AntonioRibeiro> this is working fine
[14:59:19] <AntonioRibeiro> https://bpaste.net/show/775f4111c9e9
[14:59:39] <AntonioRibeiro> running via console
[15:00:57] <taplar> that version is not doing whatever you are trying to do with the url with the callback
[15:01:02] <taplar> which has two '?' in it
[15:03:14] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, it's calling a PHP app, which will basicall ignore those url parameters...
[15:03:37] <AntonioRibeiro> it will always return the same json, for testing purposes
[15:04:10] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, calling it via postman I also receive a valid json
[15:11:45] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, that second ? is changed to a jquery identifier and some other stuff, but it really doesn't matter
[15:11:46] <AntonioRibeiro> https://i.imgur.com/Uf3nfiD.png
[15:17:55] <starlays> hello to all, I have the fallowing work done: https://jsfiddle.net/3mvw581k/4/ . If you insert in the text box field a value greater then the value from HEAD 3 colum a textarea will apper. The problem is that something breaks the .on('keyup'... event for the textarea and I don't know why. The selector $('textarea') fails to return any result... I'm stuck and I have no idea how to solve this. If someone can help it will be great. Thank you in
[15:17:55] <starlays> advance.
[15:19:41] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar, got some light here: .fail(function (failed, textStatus, error)
[15:19:54] <AntonioRibeiro> those other parameters are helping :)
[15:20:02] <taplar> ah, cool
[15:20:15] <AntonioRibeiro> SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[15:20:15] <MassDebates> hey tapparooni
[15:20:43] <taplar> sup
[15:20:49] <MassDebates> Taplaroni - Cheesey mixture of noodles and jquery
[15:20:51] <taplar> took me a sec, lol
[15:22:32] <MassDebates> I've found out a much better solution for scrolling through but I'm not as happy with the extraction.
[15:22:38] <MassDebates> Maybe I can get some help.
[15:23:05] <MassDebates> RIght now I've got a script scrolling trhoguh a series of inputs that have been filled in by the user. I want to export this to a nicely formatted PDF>
[15:23:50] <MassDebates> Extracting the data, though, for me at least, has been limited to dumping to a text file and THEN converting that text to a PDF. I'm thinking about running a print function through the browser and printing to the Document Writer to make a PDF.
[15:23:52] <taplar> starlays: you are dynamically creating textarea after you do your binding on the existing ones
[15:24:05] <MassDebates> Anyone know about the implications of trying to do this on a variety of mobile devices?
[15:24:12] <MassDebates> I've only been able to test one 1 so far.
[15:24:28] <starlays> taplar, hmm...
[15:24:43] <qakhan> hi all, i am moving rows from table1 to table2. but i want to remove last col from row which is moving to table2. here is my code. https://jsfiddle.net/81xd9uqo/13/
[15:28:36] <MassDebates> Well, if anyone's got some thoughts, I'd love to hear them. Don't forget to include my name - MassDebates - in the message so I can get the 'ping'! I'll be here but on another tab.
[15:29:40] <starlays> taplar, any hint on how to bind to the dynamic created textarea?
[15:31:07] <starlays> I think I have to and .off and then back .on somehow, first thoughts
[15:32:49] <starlays> hmm, I can create a function and call it each time after I add dynamically the element
[15:34:51] <taplar> starlays: either bind on the newly created ones directly, or better yet use a delegate
[15:36:19] <AntonioRibeiro> taplar: https://bpaste.net/show/b64071181891
[15:36:34] <AntonioRibeiro> could you take a look at it, still not sure what the error is...
[15:36:42] <AntonioRibeiro> because the json is fine...
[15:36:53] <taplar> would seem to suggest that there is a syntax error in your callback method
[15:37:05] <AntonioRibeiro> hmmm...
[15:39:14] <crashworks> What is this effect called and what's the best way of recreating it?

[15:40:48] <Sayona> Hi, can anyone help me to add a class when checkbox input is checked?
[15:40:52] <Sayona> <div id="box_<?php echo $val; $val++ ?>" class="optiune_modul"><label id="modul" class="lable_item"><input type="radio" name="anunt_optiune_radio" value="<?php echo $key['id'] ?>" data-modul-pret="<?php echo $key['pret'] ?>" data-modul-charactere="<?php echo $key['caractere'] ?>">
[15:41:03] <Sayona> need to add class for label using id modul
[15:41:18] <starlays> taplar, for the first part "bind to the newly created directly" i'm thinking at jquery .bind() but fir the "better yet use a delagate" I don't have any method ringing he bell, jquery .delegate() but it is deprecated, no idea for the last part
[15:41:44] <starlays> Sayona, Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com
[15:41:47] <taplar> starlays: on('event', 'childselector', handler);
[15:41:55] <Sayona> starlays, ok
[15:42:23] <taplar> Sayona: are you asking how to add a class to an element?
[15:42:58] <Sayona> taplar,  yes
[15:43:03] <Sayona> this is my code https://jsfiddle.net/yztey3h1/
[15:43:26] <taplar> in general it is $(selector).addClass('class')
[15:43:30] <Sayona> when is checked i want to add a class / id <label id="modul" class="lable_item">
[15:43:51] <Sayona> and is other check to remote the class and add where is checked
[15:43:59] <Sayona> i try a lot of stuff :(( not work
[15:44:17] <NoiseEee> Sayona: any attempts where you actually have some javascript?
[15:44:30] <starlays> taplar, I have $('textarea').on('keyup', function() { console.log('key pressed) }); but for the .on() it is not saying anything in the documentatin that will be attached to future elements
[15:44:51] <taplar> starlays: i disagree, :)
[15:44:58] <starlays> :(
[15:45:04] <Sayona> I remove it :(
[15:45:19] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data
[15:45:28] <taplar> the second example is a delegated event binding
[15:45:47] <taplar> the whole block about direct and delegate events
[15:47:07] <taplar> Sayona: what are you trying to do by adding the class?
[15:47:15] <taplar> you have some css here that doesn't seem to be doing anything
[15:47:25] <taplar> are you trying to change the style when an element is selected?
[15:49:23] <Sayona> https://jsfiddle.net/yztey3h1/1/
[15:49:29] <Sayona> and other stuff
[15:49:51] <taplar> those are not checkboxes man
[15:50:24] <taplar> <input type="checkbox"> is a checkbox
[15:50:33] <taplar> you are using radio buttons
[15:50:40] <Sayona> I am a girl :P
[15:50:58] <Sayona> but it is chckbox?
[15:51:01] <taplar> i have no proof of this clame
[15:51:03] <taplar> claim
[15:51:05] <taplar> blah
[15:51:08] <Sayona> type="radio"
[15:51:15] <taplar> that is a radio button
[15:51:15] <Sayona> is radio yes
[15:51:17] <taplar> not a checkbox
[15:51:36] <Sayona> input:radio
[15:51:43] <taplar> try and see
[15:52:49] <Sayona> not work
[15:53:48] <starlays> input[type='radio']
[15:53:54] <taplar> looks like it is working for me
[15:53:56] <taplar> with :radio
[15:54:03] <Sayona> let me try something
[15:54:20] <taplar> let me rephrase that
[15:54:31] <taplar> with :radio, it is doing what your event handler is saying it will do, :)
[15:54:39] <Sayona> not work at me
[15:54:43] <Sayona> really
[15:54:53] <taplar> it's not doing what you expect it to do, perhaps
[15:54:58] <taplar> but it is working as it is designed
[15:55:29] <taplar> you should stick some console logs in there to see what is going on
[15:56:27] <Sayona> :(
[15:56:48] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/yztey3h1/5/ @ Sayona   please take the time to see what is happening
[15:57:07] <Sayona> :* :* let me read
[15:57:09] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/yztey3h1/6/ really
[15:57:09] <Sayona> :*
[15:57:21] <taplar> :( giving away answers
[15:57:34] <Sayona> taplar, i will try to read with console.log
[15:57:37] <Sayona> to see
[15:58:05] <starlays> Sayona, it depends how you "walk" over the DOM elements
[15:59:35] <starlays> Sayona, if you have 3h available to go trough this: http://try.jquery.com/ it will help you a lot, it is good for start
[15:59:38] <Sayona> is so strange becouse I put that script on my ebsite and not ork
[15:59:50] <Sayona> s/ebsite/website
[15:59:54] <Sayona> starlays, thanks
[15:59:58] <NoiseEee> Sayona: you're going to have to take the time to learn a little bit about javacsript.
[16:00:09] <Sayona> thanks
[16:03:05] <taplar> Sayona: i also think you would benefit from giving this site a browse. http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[16:03:26] <taplar> being able to dig into a problem is a very important skill
[16:03:35] <taplar> imho
[16:04:11] <Sayona> thanks I will study
[16:04:14] <Sayona> in this night
[16:17:44] <starlays> taplar, Sayona has the same problem like me, she binds to early to an dynamically created element
[16:18:06] <taplar> huh?
[16:18:20] <taplar> she isn't dynamically creating anything
[16:18:35] <starlays> in her full code yes
[16:18:40] <starlays> she is doing this
[16:18:52] <starlays> http://www.drumetiimontane.ro/x/
[16:19:57] <Sayona> yey
[16:19:59] <Sayona> found the solution
[16:20:17] <Sayona> I put th code in a $(document).ready(function()  {
[16:20:39] <taplar> you have your script loading in the header?
[16:21:11] <Sayona> not really
[16:21:15] <Sayona> is in middle
[16:21:31] <taplar> but before the markup was created
[16:22:01] <Sayona> yes
[16:22:13] <Sayona> thanks :*
[16:22:25] <taplar> ya, you will have to either stick it in a document ready, or put your script right before the </body>
[16:23:15] <taplar> i'd advise the latter if possible
[16:23:20] <Sayona> thanks
[16:24:01] <Sayona> if I put that befor header
[16:24:02] <starlays> taplar, tried to delegate to tbody but still dosen't work: $('textarea').on('keyup', 'tbody', function(){...
[16:24:07] <Sayona> not work anything anymore
[16:24:15] <taplar> starlays: you have the selectors backwards
[16:24:35] <taplar> Sayona: if you put it in the header you will have to use the document ready
[16:26:00] <Sayona> thanks
[16:26:02] <starlays> taplar, yey :). Thank you. Are you on FBI most wanted list so I can search you there and send some beers to your home address :)
[16:26:31] <taplar> heh, most likely not.  i'm sure they could easily find me
[16:27:09] <taplar> Sayona: which is the reason most people will put their scripts at the bottom of the page
[16:27:18] <taplar> you understand what document ready is doing, right?
[16:27:50] <NoiseEee> 'making it work?'
[16:27:54] <taplar> :)
[16:28:26] <Sayona> taplar, yes
[16:28:36] <taplar> please tell me, ^_^
[16:32:30] <MassDebates> If I can pay in lei
[16:32:37] <MassDebates> Does that mean I'm rich if i have flower necklaces
[16:33:26] <Sayona> =))
[16:33:37] <taplar> not if you are in hawaii.  i hear it is expensive
[16:34:15] <starlays> night guys, taplar thank you once more for your efforts in helping me
[16:34:20] <MassDebates> omg
[16:34:22] <taplar> np
[16:34:26] <MassDebates> seriously taplar
[16:34:31] <taplar> :D
[16:34:31] <MassDebates> this isn't a popularity contest
[16:34:35] <MassDebates> stop paying people to say this shit
[16:34:48] <NoiseEee> what
[16:34:53] <taplar> i gotta be good at something man
[16:35:01] <MassDebates> NoiseEee:  taplar is bribing people for compliments. can we kick him?
[16:35:05] <MassDebates> Makes me look bad.
[16:35:28] <NoiseEee> depends on what my bribe is, i guess
[16:35:30] <MassDebates> ^ Evidence! Person dips out immediately after accusation?
[16:35:33] <MassDebates> Shit
[16:35:41] <MassDebates> Starlays?! ISNT THAT ENOUGH
[16:35:53] <Sayona> >:D
[16:36:15] <MassDebates> Star Lays: Lays is a big company. People don't like big companies. Star -> Stars are used for astrology and religion crux basis. Minos. Moses, Meeses. Illuminati.
[16:36:32] <MassDebates> As you can see, taplar is bribing people.
[16:36:36] <Sayona> :)
[16:36:46] <taplar> *shrug* i like chips.
[16:36:53] <MassDebates> lol
[16:36:55] <MassDebates> Oi, taplar
[16:36:59] <MassDebates> Quick question on a serious note
[16:37:22] <MassDebates> I never had to do this. Running a print from javascript but
[16:37:47] <taplar> the window.print() thing?
[16:37:49] <MassDebates> I want 2 links. one actually prints to default printer of the device. The 2nd prints arbitrarily to a pdf using the equivalent of the xps document writer
[16:38:05] <MassDebates> kin i du dis
[16:38:11] <MassDebates> I've never messed with print much
[16:38:24] <MassDebates> ... /s/much/ever-before
[16:38:31] <taplar> same, however a part of me wants to say that js can't affect the printer that is being printed to
[16:38:40] <MassDebates> This is what I was worried about.
[16:38:42] <NoiseEee> yeah, you can't
[16:38:49] <MassDebates> Shit, I was hoping I was wrong.
[16:39:32] <taplar> best I would think you could do is to present it in a pdf format and let the person save it themselves
[16:39:44] <andrew9183> just use jquery
[16:39:55] <NoiseEee> put a bird on it
[16:39:59] <MassDebates> But I'm worried about the device logistics and whatnot since its primarily mobile
[16:40:27] <MassDebates> This is out of my pool
[16:41:40] <taplar> so is the issue that for a non-mobile device you want it to print normally and for a mobile device you want a pdf?
[16:42:29] <MassDebates> I have a contact form that I'm abusing the print function to save the data to a PDF easily
[16:42:50] <MassDebates> I"m trying to use functions they're familiar with, so i figured "hey! Everyone's printed stuff before!"
[16:45:00] <MassDebates> It's not really a contact form, but I'm using that term because it's using form elements.
[16:45:06] <MassDebates> It's a sales order confirmation sheet
[16:45:37] <MassDebates> I wrote a small script to capture the signature in a modal (I wasn't happy with the plugins out there) and it converts it to a 64code that I use and play with
[16:45:51] <taplar> I really feel like I have seen it before where javascript was able to generate a file and cause a prompt for download.  Might be something to look into.
[16:46:46] <MassDebates> initially, I wrote a script that looped through every input element, pulled its user-inputted data, and then pumped out a text file and injected the values into the empty 'value' attribute for each input element
[16:47:23] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13548102/creating-download-prompt-using-purely-javascript <-- the last entry here makes me think of it, but it's not doing any pdf stuff so that would be something else to potentially look into
[16:48:25] <MassDebates> Yes, I was doing something similar to that but I found that the printing function skips a lot of the inbetween-work
[16:48:39] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:48:40] <MassDebates> My previous system needed a second step to recreate the pdf with the html code
[16:48:56] <MassDebates> I just wasn't happy with it, but it is a solution, so I'm gonna stick with that.
[16:49:06] <MassDebates> I appreciate the guidance taplar
[16:49:16] <taplar> heh, i'm just spittballing, :)
[16:50:07] * taplar stares at the clock that says he has about 10min left to go before vaca starts
[16:58:22] <MassDebates> I went back to what I had. It's working fine. I guess I was trying to improve something that didn't need to be improved. Just a small quickie, anyways.
[16:58:34] <MassDebates> Thanks taplar and NoiseEee
[16:58:35] <taplar> that's what she said
[16:58:42] <MassDebates> Shush you
[16:59:04] <MassDebates> In all seriousness, you deserve a great thanksgiving, friend.
[16:59:14] <crashworks> Thanks, you too
[16:59:17] <MassDebates> unlike that shady rob character that floats in and out as he pleases....
[16:59:22] <taplar> you too.
[16:59:49] <taplar> i think i'm set to have a quiet one with some pizza and whatever
[17:00:04] <crashworks> Can you guys take a look at this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rWmEXK ?
[17:00:36] <taplar> i'll have to point you to the other guyz.  i'm out!  happy turkey day all
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> have fun taplar
[17:00:49] <taplar> you know it
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees> crashworks i can, what's your question?
[17:02:35] <MassDebates> This looks like that one discovery script that tracked the mouse cursor to 'unhide' parts of the webpage's content
[17:02:44] <MassDebates> Like removing fog-of-war in a sense
[17:02:52] <crashworks>  robertmaxrees I want to recreat the hover-scrolling effect like here: https://www.wetdesign.com/default.html#/experiences
[17:02:56] <crashworks> Only obviously not in Flash
[17:03:27] <robertmaxrees> so what does that have to do with that pen?
[17:03:36] <crashworks> robertmaxrees: And horizontal, not vertical
[17:03:39] <MassDebates> crashworks:  I've already answered your questions almost a week ago on this.
[17:03:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:03:52] <MassDebates> crashworks:  This can almost be entirely done in CSS.
[17:04:11] <MassDebates> crashworks:  You've also been assisted by at least one moderator in #css with this ordeal, as well.
[17:04:16] <crashworks> MassDebates: I recall some non-answer like "look it up" or something
[17:04:29] <MassDebates> crashworks:  Yes, the moderator wasn't as friendly to you as I was.
[17:04:33] <crashworks> MassDebates: I was never in css
[17:04:35] <MassDebates> crashworks:  oh, wait. I think I was the dick in that situation.
[17:05:20] <MassDebates> Yeah. I remember now. The moderator was actually being a bit more flexible. I told you to look into hover effects and hover positioning with a container inside of a scrollable overflow box.
[17:05:36] <MassDebates> But then he actually gave you an example of it, but it was horizontal just like you asked.
[17:05:53] <MassDebates> He actually just rehashed his solution from helping out the guy that wanted to copy Mountain Dew's bottom bar.
[17:05:59] <crashworks> Are you sure you're not thinking of someone else?
[17:06:17] <MassDebates> I could be, but only so many people come up looking to recreate the gimmicks of a flash project.
[17:06:27] <MassDebates> (This means I'm not thinking of someone else)
[17:06:56] <crashworks> I don't recall anyone being so helpful
[17:07:10] <crashworks> Maybe I didn't see it
[17:07:24] <crashworks> Because otherwise I wouldn't have come back here asking the same question
[17:07:46] <crashworks> HA! Oh shit mountaindew.com does have the same effect!
[17:07:59] <robertmaxrees> so you basically have a question about how to do parallax effects based on mouse position.
[17:08:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[17:08:52] <crashworks> robertmaxrees: based on mouse position, yes.
[17:08:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/X7UwG/854/
[17:08:59] <crashworks> Not sure if parallax is the best term though
[17:09:04] <robertmaxrees> looks like this example has something with that.
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> you want to move page content based on mouse position.
[17:09:24] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle has that, too.
[17:09:59] <MassDebates> For the record
[17:10:18] <MassDebates> If someone was helpful, you wouldn't be back here asking the same question because your question would have been resolved if that person was helpful...
[17:10:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:10:29] <robertmaxrees> alright mano - it's all good.
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:10:38] <crashworks> Massdebates, Yes, that's exactly my point.
[17:10:45] <MassDebates> you can't tell me that's not funny
[17:10:51] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:10:55] <robertmaxrees> can we let it go now?
[17:11:04] <MassDebates> @ both of you! I mean for these words to be friendly
[17:11:12] <crashworks> Don't say anything so I can scroll up REALLY far
[17:11:49] <robertmaxrees> crashworks fwiw there are logs at irc.jquery.org
[17:11:50] <crashworks> OK I found the logs
[17:11:54] <crashworks> "(9:31:05 PM) MassDebates: I'm noping out of that one crash sorry"
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaaalright so let's get onto topic again, yeah?
[17:12:32] <crashworks> "(9:31:42 PM) MassDebates: I mean that someone else may be able to answer your questions"
[17:12:41] <MassDebates> Oh man! That WASNT you!
[17:12:43] <MassDebates> Holy shit!
[17:12:49] <MassDebates> Totally rescind my comments 100%.
[17:12:55] <crashworks> Are you being sarcastic?
[17:12:59] <MassDebates> No 100% genuine
[17:13:09] <MassDebates> Sorry dude
[17:13:15] <MassDebates> I remember you 100% now
[17:13:38] <MassDebates> But rob is right we should jump back on topic
[17:13:54] <MassDebates> That was my fault and I shall go inactive now. Sorry again!
[17:14:07] <crashworks> MassDebates: Let me shake your hand
[17:15:43] * MassDebates shakes it
[17:15:58] <crashworks> Gross, that wasn't your hand
[17:16:17] <MassDebates> At any rate, we're still off-topic. I was 100% wrong. Apologies again, and let's get back to #jquery!
[17:16:36] <crashworks> Alright, you mentioned lifting from Mountain Dew
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:16:47] <crashworks> Turns out, mountaindew.com does have pretty much exactly what I'm shooting for
[17:16:58] <crashworks> Whoda thunk it?
[17:18:03] <crashworks> So MassDebates did that other guy do the heavy lifting on beautifying the code?
[17:18:11] <crashworks> I'd rather re-use someone else's hard work
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:19:37] <MassDebates> Well he had it in a very.. uh
[17:19:43] <MassDebates> Really really bright outlines for layout
[17:19:51] <MassDebates> I'm still seeing bright magenta gridlines
[17:24:52] <crashworks> MassDebates: Was this in #css?
[19:14:56] <jquery710> I can't get a button triggered on document ready. Cna I paste here what my button looks like, please?
[19:19:04] <jquery710> $('#fullscreen_controls').on( "click", '#menu', function(e){     $('#b1').trigger(e.type);     $('#b2').trigger(e.type);     $('#b3').trigger(e.type);     $('#b4').trigger(e.type); });
[19:19:35] <jquery710> how do I make this button trigger on document ready?
[19:19:50] <jquery710> instead of on click?
[19:41:42] <l33n> i have this ajax function, and I want to store a json in a js array, here is the funcition, below is the json at the url, and below that is the array I want, any pointers?
[19:41:46] <l33n> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e4ee29d1f0962138d78ac3a3b4faa4ff
[19:42:28] <l33n> the array on the bottom has different values than the json, but I want the array to be like that
[19:52:15] <_______alex> hey
[20:09:16] <shoky> l33n: you can use .map   something like  data.map(item => [item.id, item.address, item.distance, item.flow_rate, item.status])
[20:29:07] <ExtraSteve> I guess he needs more than 5 minutes
[20:52:17] <l33n> having trouble getting any output with this js code, any pointers would be appreciated: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0688f7281b55fff764c9afeb80f2e3b0
[20:52:27] <l33n> this is the results page: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9a9bc18674f8de92fe62c5915ca35675
