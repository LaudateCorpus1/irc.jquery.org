[06:05:19] <someguy99> hi
[06:06:46] <someguy99> could somebody help me with jq? I need to add an object into another object and I can't seem to find a working solution
[06:07:14] <Uhkis> someguy99: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[06:08:38] <someguy99> i'm dumb
[06:08:46] <someguy99> i thought jq stood for jquery
[06:08:59] <someguy99> i need help with jq which is used for jsons
[06:09:47] <someguy99> it's probably trivial, but this is the first time i'm using it and i just need it for a part of my bash script
[06:11:25] <Uhkis> then you're probably in the wrong place
[06:16:37] <someguy99> could you point me to the right place?
[06:17:39] <someguy99> i'll try #bash
[06:17:46] <someguy99> thanks anyway :)
[06:21:54] <Uhkis> kinda hard to say with that info, ##javascript probably too
[07:01:16] <ne2k> I've got some html strings that act as layout templates (one up, four up, nine up, etc.) with the slots in them identified by id "slot-1", "slot-2", etc. these are reused in each template. I'd like to be able to have multiple templates instantiated at once, so I don't want to use a global $("#slot-1") to get the slot, I'd like to search only within that element so I can get unique handles. what's the right way to do this? .fi
[07:01:16] <ne2k> nd()?
[07:06:54] <ne2k> seems to work
[07:11:54] <Cork> ne2k: i would recommend to use class instead, then you can just modify the template before you append it to the page
[07:12:33] <ne2k> Cork, not sure I follow, sorry
[07:13:24] <Cork> var newInstance = template.clone(); newInstance.find('.slot-1').text(newText); $('#target').append(newInstance)
[07:13:58] <ne2k> ah, clone is what I was missing. thanks, I'll look into it
[07:14:20] <Cork> ne2k: clone() is for when you have a dom instance of the template
[07:14:32] <ne2k> Cork, I just have it as an html string
[07:14:33] <Cork> ne2k: i would recommend to use a <template> element to store it initially
[07:15:00] <Cork> ne2k: then just do var newInstance = $($.parseHTML(string))
[07:15:09] <Cork> you can't work with strings in jquery
[07:15:21] <ne2k> Cork, ah, I've currently got it coded as a string in a JS object. <template> sounds like a better way to go
[07:15:33] <Cork> ya it does
[07:15:42] <Cork> or rather ya, it is :)
[07:15:50] <ne2k> Cork, I just did $el = $(htmlstring), I guess that's "bad"
[07:16:06] <ne2k> parseHTML() is presumably safer
[07:16:23] <Cork> ne2k: if the string starts with something that isn't < $() will fail
[07:16:32] <Cork> so ya, you should always wrap it in $.parseHTML()
[07:16:54] <Cork> also about <template> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[07:17:26] <ne2k> that looks handy. I guess it doesn't really matter where you put it in the HTML source?
[07:17:40] <Cork> ne2k: it kinda does
[07:17:55] <Cork> if you put it straight in the dom it will be parsed as dom elements
[07:18:10] <Cork> while in a script tag or in template it doesn't slow down the dom
[07:18:20] <Cork> (and isn't addressable before you actually use it)
[07:18:23] <ne2k> oh, it can go in <head> apparently
[07:19:01] <ne2k> Cork, sorry, I meant where in the html should I put the <template> tag?
[07:19:11] <Cork> ah, it can go anywhere in body
[07:19:42] <ne2k> can I put arbitrary attributes in it and get them out? <template foo="bar" thing="whatsit"> ?
[07:20:13] <Cork> ne2k: check the link i gave you
[07:20:21] <Cork> and i don't think template is valid in head
[07:20:42] <Cork> hah.. it is...
[07:20:43] <Cork> ok
[07:20:43] <ne2k> ooh, there's <slot> too!
[07:20:59] <Cork> ya, template is meant to actually create templates :)
[07:21:05] <Cork> so it has lots of nice things there
[07:21:11] * Cork afk
[07:23:05] * Cork is back
[09:31:00] <kanha> Hi guys, I am new to jQuery. I get "Uncaught TypeError: $.post is not a function" as error while trying a .post method. See the snippet here: https://jsfiddle.net/o8rkedmw/  I am not able to figure out what's going wrong. Any help would be appreciated.
[09:32:38] <kanha> On googling I found that this problem occurs due to "jquery slim version". Not sure what it is. Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38793723/uncaught-typeerror-post-is-not-a-function
[09:34:05] <Cork> kanha: what do you get if you run $.version ?
[09:36:44] <kanha> Cork, it says undefined
[09:37:25] <kanha> I am using https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.0/jquery.min.js as source so version should be 3.4.0
[09:38:01] <Cork> kanha: opps sorry it is $.fn.jquery
[09:38:14] <Cork> if that doesn't exist you haven't loaded jquery yet
[09:38:33] <Cork> (run it just before the $.post call)
[09:38:40] <Cork> not in the console
[09:39:08] <kanha> Cork, it says 3.4.0
[09:39:15] <Cork> ok, so it isn't that
[15:03:59] <taplar> Cork's morning conversation was very unsatisfying
[15:04:06] <robertmaxrees> uh oh...
[15:04:20] <taplar> he knows what i'm talking about, :)
[15:05:34] <Cork> i do?
[15:05:57] <taplar> the $.post not working convo that just dropped after a version check?
[15:06:02] <Cork> ah
[15:06:05] <Cork> ya...
[15:06:15] <Cork> that wasn't morning though :)
[15:06:32] <Cork> unless you call 15:30 morning :P
[15:06:36] <taplar> well, relative to me it was.
[15:07:21] <Cork> the question cam in the middle of me debugging a problem for a coworker so... count't even give him full attention
[15:07:37] <Cork> but ya, didn't manage to figure out what was breaking for him
[15:07:42] <Cork> the jsfiddle worked fine for me
[15:08:25] <Cork> and when i started looking at it again a few minutes later he had disconnected
[15:09:27] <taplar> i was curious if on his real page he was including multiple jq versions
[15:09:47] <taplar> i saw a S.O. post once where the framework was including jq slim after the fact
[15:09:47] <Cork> shouldn't make $.post undefined though
[15:09:56] <Cork> ah, ya
[15:10:12] <Cork> if it would have been 5 years ago i would have asked if he uses prototype on the page
[15:10:30] <robertmaxrees> good chance they're using WP
[15:10:30] <Cork> those problems where so common back then
[15:10:49] <Cork> but wp doesn't include slim by default does it?
[15:10:58] <robertmaxrees> no, but it may be an outdated version
[15:11:13] <Cork> 1.0 had $.post so...
[15:11:38] <Cork> though i'm assuming he didn't get a console error he didn't mention
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah but the noconflict it runs
[15:11:46] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ :)
[15:12:05] <Cork> he used alert all over the place so ya, don't think he knew about the console
[15:13:00] <taplar> correct me if i'm wrong, but if you did $(function($){}) while jq is like 3x, even if a slim version was included later, the scoped down $ in the closure would still be the 3X version, ya?
[15:13:28] <Cork> no, cause you use $()
[15:13:39] <Cork> but jQuery(function($){}) would
[15:13:46] <taplar> hmm
[15:14:07] <Cork> same as (function($) {})(jQuery);
[15:14:30] <robertmaxrees> though that last one is not functionally the same as the others
[15:14:42] <Cork> and i don't think that was the problem cause he used $(document).ready and apparently the click handlers worked
[15:14:53] <Cork> nope, didn't mean to say it was
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> (mostly saying that just in case someone reads this thread later and gets confused by that)
[15:17:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/tvhgbyqr/  ?
[15:17:48] <taplar> seems like it logs the version of the jQuery that was defined at the time
[15:20:25] <Cork> taplar: ah, i missunderstood what you talked about
[15:20:42] <Cork> taplar: thought you meant with noConflict
[15:21:08] <Cork> well then ya, the scope will have the version defined at the time
[15:21:08] <taplar> nah.  just using the passed in value as a sorta "safety" to future version includes
[15:21:20] <taplar> which should be fixed, but just as an approach
[15:21:50] <Cork> the scope redefines the $ to the one triggering the ready function, so it will keep that version
[15:28:08] <taplar> and wait, if that was at 15:30 for you, isn't it like 01:00 now?
[16:00:11] <taplar> he fell asleep at the keyboard...
[16:05:52] <impliednude> so, I have a datalayer.push I would generally send via onclick and the button being used. However, my clients setup requires me to work within the cdn and it removes onclick events. Which means I have to use jquery in this instance.
[16:06:08] <impliednude> I know I can do $("selector").click
[16:06:17] <impliednude> then fire the event.
[16:06:50] <impliednude> For this dataLayer.push({‘des_Association_Text’: ‘12oz_pack’}); how would I incorportate it?
[16:07:30] <robertmaxrees> impliednude not sure what you mean.
[16:07:32] <taplar> First off, what do you mean it removes onclick events?
[16:07:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:07:52] <impliednude> taplar> cloudflare is removing the onclick event simple as that
[16:08:03] <taplar> are you talkinga bout the event, or the attribute?
[16:08:24] <impliednude> soo if I have a button that says onclick="etc.." it will remove onclick="etc.." fromm the html
[16:08:30] <taplar> that's the attribute
[16:09:04] <taplar> you can add that binding without the attribute by using addEventListener with the DOM Element
[16:11:14] <robertmaxrees> though if you want to use jQuery, you can :)
[16:13:36] <taplar> that's interesting though that a platform is restricting people from using inline bindings, lol
[16:14:08] <impliednude> I will just use jQuery('.selector').click(function(){ 'dataLayer.push({ '123':'abc'});
[16:14:16] <impliednude> taplar> yep as do I
[16:14:20] <robertmaxrees> you've got an extra ' in there.
[16:14:49] <impliednude> whelp, ya know what I mean lol
[16:19:06] <robertmaxrees> ?:D
[17:35:31] <jak2000> hi all
[17:36:06] <taplar> hola
[17:36:11] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[17:36:28] <jak2000> i added with jquery a class to a Row (on a HtmlTable)  named 'divMyRowSelected', my question is... how to remove this class, before add? thanks
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> how do you think you'd remove it?
[17:36:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:37:39] <jak2000> removeclass i know but, i need remove of all Rows (if this exist)...
[17:38:06] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to remove that class from every element that has it?
[17:38:11] <taplar> how would you find all rows that have that class?
[17:39:04] <jak2000> yes every TR element...
[17:39:09] <jak2000> or all table
[17:39:19] <taplar> how would you do it?
[17:39:26] <jak2000> ok
[17:40:14] <jak2000> with: var xRow = $(this).closest("tr"); xRow.find(".myNoPedidoSap").addClass('clRowSelected');
[17:40:21] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:40:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not removing anything though?
[17:40:51] <robertmaxrees> how do you select by class?
[17:42:29] * robertmaxrees queues the jeopardy think music
[17:42:53] <jak2000> wwith this i add the Class...
[17:43:09] <taplar> forget that for now
[17:43:14] <jak2000> my question s, need before add do a for each (loop on each row) and remove it?
[17:43:18] <jak2000> *is
[17:43:24] <taplar> your question was, how to remove the class from elements that already have it
[17:43:39] <taplar> so, the question -is-, how do you find elements that have a class
[17:43:52] <taplar> if you can find them, you can remove the class from them
[17:44:44] <taplar> there it is!
[17:44:53] * taplar ♫jeopardy music♫
[17:44:53] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:44:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:45:05] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 it's really as simple as it sounds
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> just select on that class, and then removeClass
[17:45:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't need any loops or anything
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you rarely need loops with jquery.  if you look at the docs for almost any method, you'll see something to the effect of "from each element in the set of matched elements" in the description.
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> that means it loops for you.
[17:46:43] <jak2000> ok i understand.... $('.clRowSelected').removeClass('clRowSelected);
[17:46:44] <jak2000> ?
[17:46:58] <robertmaxrees> add an extra closing quote, but yeah!
[17:47:10] <jak2000> yes, thanks
[17:47:12] <jak2000> testing
[17:49:26] <jak2000> interesting... fine... and clear
[17:49:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:06:33] <Sal> hi, i have no idea on how to resolve this: I have a form and I have some jquery code on its submit. Inside this code, I execute an ajax to call some server-side scripts to check some db data, On the ajax success, i should submit the form
[20:07:01] <Sal> my problem is that the ajax is async and that the function called on submit ends before
[20:07:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:07:25] <Sal> i know, sorry for my english
[20:07:33] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your js in a fiddle?
[20:08:23] <Sal> anyway, a form, on its submit i run a jquery function that executes an ajax
[20:08:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah so can we see the code?
[20:08:39] <robertmaxrees> so that i can better understand the issue?
[20:08:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:08:47] <Sal> from the success of this ajax call, i need to submit the form ( or continue its submit)
[20:09:08] <robertmaxrees> so there's no concept of "continue" the submit.
[20:09:34] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to handle this.  my first inclination is to ask why you don't just submit the whole thing via ajax.
[20:09:54] <Sal> https://is.gd/QBCU0H
[20:10:04] <robertmaxrees> like, you're already partway there - why not just ship the entire form over as apart of the initial call and then go from there.
[20:10:05] <Sal> i was trying this method, but no page gets loaded
[20:10:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not really helpful heh.
[20:10:36] <Sal> i know, but the entire code is a lot
[20:11:01] <Sal> I'm just trying to find a way to finaly submit the form if the ajax returns data== 1
[20:11:29] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you ARE submitting it there, you're just not doing anything after that inner ajax call finishes.
[20:11:40] <Sal> i was using the return false/true way, but like I said, the ajax is async
[20:11:55] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - all ajax is async :)
[20:11:59] <robertmaxrees> it's part of the na,e
[20:12:01] <robertmaxrees> *name
[20:12:13] <robertmaxrees> that inner $.ajax() call is already sending the data though.
[20:12:21] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't look like you want to submit the form a 3rd time.
[20:12:23] <Sal> https://is.gd/ryWMFY
[20:12:30] <Sal> this is the entire ajax call
[20:12:36] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:13:07] <robertmaxrees> what about what I'm saying isn't making sense?
[20:13:27] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call inside that submit is already submitting the form.  you just need to handle when it finishes.
[20:14:16] <Sal> you mean a return true?
[20:14:19] <Sal> thats it?
[20:14:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:14:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of ajax calls like that.
[20:14:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you want to have happen when that inner ajax call is done?
[20:14:49] <Sal> I know, thats why I'm here asking for help
[20:14:50] <Sal> :)
[20:14:58] <Sal> i'm getting crazy on it
[20:15:04] <Sal> i tried many way
[20:15:13] <Sal> +s
[20:15:17] <robertmaxrees> so could you answer my last question?
[20:15:28] <robertmaxrees> what do you want the page to do when that inner ajax call finishes?
[20:16:17] <Sal> nothing, its just to call a page and pass POST parameters to it
[20:16:20] <Sal> like a form
[20:16:27] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue?
[20:16:31] <Sal> i just need the initial form the really submit
[20:16:38] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[20:16:44] <Sal> sorry
[20:16:45] <robertmaxrees> okay so let's back waaaay up.
[20:16:57] <robertmaxrees> you're submitting the form right now with ajax.
[20:17:01] <robertmaxrees> right?
[20:17:06] <Sal> its late here, and I think my head is missing some silly things
[20:17:15] <Sal> no
[20:17:19] <robertmaxrees> yes?
[20:17:24] <Sal> nop
[20:17:27] <robertmaxrees> ....
[20:17:32] <robertmaxrees> please send the actual code then.
[20:17:33] <Sal> or better, I think I'm not
[20:17:41] <robertmaxrees> because your screenshots say otherwise.
[20:18:08] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/NNQynLY.png
[20:18:12] <robertmaxrees> that's you submitting the form via ajax
[20:18:20] <Sal> https://pastebin.com/Gd8J6Zhv
[20:18:35] <Sal> this is the function I call on form submit
[20:18:57] <Sal> inside this form , i execute the ajax, to call a server-side script to check data on a db
[20:19:22] <Sal> on the return of this ajax, i have to submit the form (return true)
[20:19:42] <robertmaxrees> okay so you can't return out of an ajax call.
[20:19:58] <robertmaxrees> also, once you call e.preventDefault(), you can't "un-do" it./
[20:20:05] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't matter here.
[20:20:24] <Sal> I inserted the inner ajax, just to try to call the web page and pass to it post data
[20:20:33] <robertmaxrees> right, which it's doing.
[20:20:49] <robertmaxrees> now you just need to figure out how to handle that successfully completing
[20:21:11] <Sal> of the first ajax?
[20:21:15] <robertmaxrees> ño.
[20:21:16] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:21:21] <robertmaxrees> in the success callback on that ajax call.
[20:21:32] <Sal> on the inner ajax call?
[20:21:43] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[20:21:58] <Sal> so, success is needed always?
[20:22:07] <robertmaxrees> i would use .then()
[20:22:27] <Sal> what about succes: function () {}
[20:22:35] <robertmaxrees> i would use .then() alwaysx
[20:22:38] <robertmaxrees> and never success:
[20:22:50] <Sal> oh, i've never used that
[20:22:57] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you on?
[20:23:05] <Sal> let me check
[20:23:15] <Sal> 3.3.1
[20:23:30] <robertmaxrees> oh wow yeah, you should be using promises for this stuff.
[20:24:05] <robertmaxrees> success/error are all but dead.
[20:24:12] <Sal> damn
[20:24:23] <robertmaxrees> super easy to swap over
[20:24:31] <Sal> so it became something like the "if then" stuff?
[20:24:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:24:51] <Sal> I didn't find any sample of that on jquery site
[20:24:59] <Sal> thats why i never used it
[20:25:02] <robertmaxrees> it's there.
[20:25:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/qeg0o9pj/
[20:25:23] <robertmaxrees> that's how you use .then() and .catch()
[20:25:53] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you can't really "return" out of an ajax call.
[20:26:23] <Sal> oh, you mean the then and catch
[20:26:28] <Sal> yeah, i use that
[20:26:38] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:26:39] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[20:26:44] <Sal> i thought you were saying that ajax had another parameter called then
[20:26:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:27:12] <Sal> and where would you put that?
[20:27:19] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[20:27:33] <Sal> around the inner ajax call?
[20:27:41] <robertmaxrees> did you actually look at the code?
[20:27:50] <Sal> ops, sorry
[20:27:54] <Sal> didn't see that line
[20:27:56] <robertmaxrees> it's the same 2 nested ajax calls you're doing now, but with .then()/.cath()
[20:28:00] <robertmaxrees> *.catch()
[20:28:02] <robertmaxrees> heh ok
[20:28:32] <Sal> wow, thats hell!!!!
[20:28:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:28:47] <Sal> didn't think of it that way
[20:29:01] <robertmaxrees> why is that "hell"?
[20:29:02] <Sal> nice way
[20:29:11] <Sal> :)
[20:29:14] <robertmaxrees> 'kay heh
[20:29:34] <Sal> I'll do it your way
[20:29:37] <Sal> I like it better
[20:29:42] <Sal> thanks for your help
[20:29:47] <robertmaxrees> as opposed to what other way?
[20:30:06] <Sal> the one on jquery docs under voice "ajax"
[20:30:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:30:33] <Sal> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[20:30:39] <Sal> all the ones on this page

[20:32:03] <Sal> ok
[20:32:07] <robertmaxrees> promises are also basically industry standard for anything async.
[20:32:14] <Sal> got it, its not on the page but on the second link
[20:32:21] <Sal> at least .then
[20:32:26] <Sal> thanks
[20:32:30] <robertmaxrees> .then os on the first page...
[20:32:59] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/7TlEdD1.png
[20:33:03] <Sal> yep, you're right
[20:33:04] <Sal> :)
[20:33:08] <Sal> didn't see it
[20:34:59] <Sal> its not working
[20:35:01] <Sal> :(
[20:35:12] <Sal> the inner ajax is not loading the page
[20:35:12] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got code-wise.
[20:35:28] <Sal> i just added for now the success: on the inner ajax
[20:35:38] <robertmaxrees> and what are you doing in that handler?
[20:35:42] <Sal> and nothing happens like before
[20:35:49] <robertmaxrees> better yet, just show me the code.
[20:36:05] <Sal> nothing in the handler
[20:36:08] <robertmaxrees> ....
[20:36:09] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:36:18] <robertmaxrees> you have to actually write code.
[20:36:27] <robertmaxrees> just putting a success handler on it won't change anything.
[20:36:39] <robertmaxrees> you have to explicitly tell the browser what to do next.
[20:36:40] <Sal> :)
[20:36:41] <Sal> ok
[20:38:22] <Sal> https://is.gd/vGPyrB
[20:38:25] <Sal> not working
[20:38:39] <Sal> i inserted a "return true" in it
[20:38:45] <robertmaxrees> what did i say earlier about returning out of ajax calls?
[20:39:14] <robertmaxrees> also: please don't share screenshots of code.  just share the actual code itself.  thx
[20:40:00] <Sal> ok, sorry, but its just a little bit faster. ok, let me read all you wrote
[20:40:18] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of ajax calls like that.
[20:40:24] <robertmaxrees> third time i'm saying this.
[20:40:39] <robertmaxrees> i also pointed out earlier that once you call e.preventDefault(), there's no going back.
[20:40:47] <robertmaxrees> you cannot "continue" the submit event.
[20:43:35] <Sal> I didn't want to, is just wanted to insert some dummy code, ok, i'll do a 1=1;
[20:43:42] <robertmaxrees> huh????
[20:43:49] <robertmaxrees> "insert some dummy code" and do what?
[20:44:17] <Sal> I'm lost
[20:44:20] <Sal> sorry
[20:44:30] <robertmaxrees> so stop for a sec.
[20:44:42] <robertmaxrees> ignore the submit.  that's long gone
[20:44:46] <robertmaxrees> you've sent the data to the server.
[20:44:54] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want to do next?  take the user to another page?
[20:45:21] <robertmaxrees> maybe pop a dialog or notification that the form successfully submitted?
[20:46:06] <Sal> oh f_ck!!!!! I'm stupid, sorry
[20:46:18] <robertmaxrees> ??
[20:46:30] <Sal> the ajax calls a server-side script and waits for a response
[20:46:40] <robertmaxrees> the first one does.
[20:46:50] <robertmaxrees> then the second, internal one sends all the form data.
[20:46:56] <Sal> I just wanted to call and run another page passing it all the forms data just like a normal form subit does
[20:47:09] <robertmaxrees> so that inner ajax call won't do that.
[20:47:15] <robertmaxrees> but that's OK, since you'
[20:47:21] <Sal> I know, i just saw that
[20:47:22] <robertmaxrees> *you're already submitting the form, just via ajax.
[20:47:22] <Sal> hehehe
[20:47:27] <robertmaxrees> just saw what?
[20:47:36] <Sal> that the code is wrong
[20:47:40] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with it
[20:47:40] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:47:45] <Sal> its not gonna do what i want
[20:47:49] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:47:51] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[20:47:53] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[20:47:54] <Sal> :(
[20:47:56] <Sal> hehehehe
[20:48:00] <robertmaxrees> that inner ajax call is fine./
[20:48:05] <robertmaxrees> you jsut need to change your strategy.
[20:48:06] <robertmaxrees> but w/e.
[20:48:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not taking any of my advice anyway.  no point.
[20:48:19] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[20:48:46] <Sal> the problem is that its hard for me to understand what you're saying
[20:49:00] <Sal> anyway, thanks
[20:49:11] <Sal> i'll play with it
[20:49:16] <robertBusy> so then let's try this one more tiome.
[20:49:18] <robertBusy> *time
[20:49:37] <Sal> let me just ask a simple question
[20:49:47] <robertBusy> ?
[20:50:47] <Sal> can that inenr ajax run as a js window.location = "whatever"  to load a new browser web page?
[20:50:55] <robertBusy> yes.
[20:51:10] <Sal> then why doesn't the page show in browser?
[20:51:17] <Sal> thats my prob
[20:51:19] <robertBusy> .........................................
[20:51:23] <robertBusy> where in your code are you doing that?
[20:51:44] <Sal> the inner ajax
[20:51:56] <robertBusy> literally nowhere in any code you'
[20:52:07] <robertBusy> *you've shown me so far are you doing that.
[20:52:12] <robertBusy> show me your current code.
[20:52:33] <Sal> so, like I said, the inner ajax does not show a new page in the browser
[20:52:43] <Sal> it just sends data to a server script
[20:52:46] <robertBusy> correct.
[20:52:50] <Sal> oh
[20:52:53] <Sal> :)
[20:53:06] <robertBusy> and it never will because you don't have any code in its .then()
[20:53:13] <robertBusy> or success handler.
[20:53:21] <Sal> so, how can i send the form data via POST to a new page and show it inside the browser
[20:53:28] <robertBusy> lmao.
[20:53:31] <robertBusy> so.
[20:53:43] <robertBusy> that's going to be incredibly difficult to do given your current setup.
[20:54:00] <robertBusy> which is why i'm suggesting that you follow an alterantive route.
[20:54:10] <Sal> ok, so my going out of mind is justified
[20:54:30] <robertBusy> your inner ajax call is taking care of half the work.
[20:54:44] <robertBusy> you just need to setup a page that you can send users to with that information.
[20:55:09] <Sal> yep
[20:55:20] <Sal> I usually do it with window-location
[20:55:29] <Sal> but this time i need to pass POST data
[20:55:30] <robertBusy> *window.location
[20:55:33] <robertBusy> no.
[20:55:36] <robertBusy> no no no no no
[20:55:54] <robertBusy> you need to change your setup so that you just have a plain ol' success page
[20:55:58] <robertBusy> then window.location to that page.
[20:56:06] <robertBusy> you're already handling the .post
[20:56:35] <Sal> what?
[20:56:38] <Sal> you mean...
[20:57:01] <robertBusy> so instead of doing a normal form post, you use the ajax call you're using now.
[20:57:07] <Sal> that i make two server calls, one for the post data (via ajax) and a window-location to load the page?
[20:57:15] <robertBusy> *window.location
[20:57:18] <robertBusy> and yes.
[20:57:23] <Sal> omg
[20:57:55] <Sal> using the same page i use in the inner ajax?
[20:58:01] <Sal> the same url i mean
[20:58:06] <robertBusy> i would create a new page for that.
[20:58:22] <robertBusy> since you won't be doing a post to get there.
[20:58:26] <Sal> but its that page that i need to show up
[20:58:26] <robertBusy> and that might become confusing.
[20:58:45] <Sal> i'm getting confused
[20:58:53] <robertBusy> lots of places will redirect a user to a success page that's at a different url than the post address.
[20:59:38] <Sal> i think I didn't explain well what I need to do
[20:59:45] <robertBusy> i know exactly what you nmeed to do.
[20:59:45] <Sal> so, sorry for losing your time
[20:59:53] <robertBusy> you've explained it perfectly fine.
[21:00:05] <robertBusy> good luck
[21:00:35] <Sal> i'll try, but i don't think that i'll find all my post data in the window.location loaded page
[21:00:53] <robertBusy> because you dfon't want to.
[21:01:04] <robertBusy> nor do you need to.
[21:01:12] <robertBusy> you have already submitted the form data in the ajax call.
[21:01:27] <robertBusy> the data is sent.  there is no need for another post.
[21:02:00] <Sal> ok, i'll try
[21:02:14] <robertBusy> i would create a copy of the current post url page, but get rid of the need to post to it.
[21:02:18] <robertBusy> just a normal ol' webpage.
[21:02:31] <robertBusy> and then window.location to that page in the success of that inner ajax call
[21:04:46] <Sal> https://pastebin.com/mFVqQ87e
[21:04:49] <Sal> not working
[21:05:05] <robertBusy> is it unemployed?
[21:05:28] <robertBusy> did you read any of what i just said?
[21:05:49] <Sal> listen, I'm very sorry for letting you lose time
[21:06:00] <Sal> I thank you a lot for your help
[21:06:18] <Sal> but we are on two different lines
[21:06:23] <robertBusy> i feel like you're ignoring my advice, barging ahead, and then wondering why things don't work./
[21:06:28] <Sal> or at least io'm on a different one
[21:06:32] <robertBusy> my solution is very, very simple.
[21:06:38] <robertBusy> if there's a part that you don't understand, ask.
[21:06:47] <Sal> so, thanks for your help, I'll try to find a solution some way
[21:06:52] <robertBusy> but ignoring advice repeatedly and then simply saying "doesn't work" is ineffective.
[21:06:55] <robertBusy> :shrug:
[21:06:57] <robertBusy> alright.
[21:07:07] <Sal> I' don't know how to proceed
[21:07:16] <Sal> I'm not understanding what you are saying
[21:07:24] <robertBusy> where am i losing you?
[21:07:25] <Sal> so I don't see any solution
[21:07:34] <robertBusy> it's not a one-line, js-only fix.
[21:07:49] <robertBusy> it's a simple fix, but it's not something you're going to remedy in 5 minutes.
[21:08:06] <Sal> I just need to continues the damn form submit after checking data on server
[21:08:08] <Sal> thats it
[21:08:12] <robertBusy> you cannot do that.
[21:08:17] <Sal> so I'll search for another way on doing it
[21:08:18] <robertBusy> the event has been canceled.
[21:08:24] <robertBusy> there is no way to accomplish that.
[21:08:32] <Sal> I tried without canceling it too
[21:08:43] <robertBusy> that won't work either.
[21:08:51] <Sal> but the functions ends before the ajax call retursn result
[21:08:55] <robertBusy> what you have right noe is like 75% of the way to being done.
[21:09:30] <robertBusy> so in the original form submit, what page are you taking the user to?
[21:09:38] <Sal> i also trid with $form.submit()
[21:09:44] <robertBusy> does it just say "hooray you submitted the form!"
[21:09:50] <Sal> but it does a strange thing
[21:09:59] <robertBusy> yeah, it goes recursive.
[21:10:03] <Sal> it loads the page, but passes parameters as GET all on the url
[21:10:29] <Sal> no, i set .off the submit event listener before
[21:10:29] <robertBusy> what does this next page contain
[21:10:30] <robertBusy> ?
[21:10:35] <robertBusy> what do you actually show the user?
[21:10:53] <Sal> its a list of data filtered from year to year
[21:11:03] <robertBusy> of the data they just submitted?
[21:11:09] <robertBusy> or of everything?
[21:11:13] <Sal> this is a form where the user inserts from year to year
[21:11:32] <Sal> and before submitting, i need to check if there is any data on the server in that interval
[21:11:36] <robertBusy> is the next page showing only the data the user submitted?
[21:11:43] <robertBusy> or all data you have?
[21:11:47] <Sal> if there aint any, i need to sggest under the form some intervals
[21:12:23] <Sal> its showing a list of data filtered by form parameters (from year, to year)
[21:12:34] <robertBusy> is the next page showing only the data the user submitted?
[21:12:37] <robertBusy> yes/no
[21:13:05] <Sal> I can't answer to that
[21:13:10] <robertBusy> why not?
[21:13:12] <Sal> because the user submited two years
[21:13:25] <Sal> and the data shown if a list of names and other stuff
[21:13:36] <robertBusy> is it just the data the user submitted?
[21:14:03] <robertBusy> i'm trying really hard to understand what about that question is confusing.
[21:14:06] <Sal> the users submits "from year" and "to year"
[21:14:10] <Sal> so, no, it isin't
[21:14:31] <robertBusy> okay.  so it's showing a larger result set filtered down?
[21:14:38] <Sal> yes
[21:14:51] <robertBusy> okay.  so it sounds like you want 2 things to happen.
[21:15:04] <Sal> this is it:
[21:15:20] <robertBusy> the inner ajax call needs to handle the post.  then the page you send the user to needs to support GET parameters since it's basically a search page
[21:15:29] <robertBusy> and you just need to send the user to the correct page.
[21:15:41] <robertBusy> with the right querystring param.
[21:15:45] <robertBusy> *params
[21:16:32] <Sal> ok, I think i know where i'm doing it wrong then
[21:17:14] <Sal> instead of the inner ajax, i need to call the page with window.location and pass data on the url
[21:17:23] <robertBusy> that's one way.
[21:17:40] <robertBusy> though it kind of sounds like you're mashing together a search page with a form submit page.
[21:17:44] <robertBusy> which is really strange.
[21:17:51] <Sal> yes, but in this way, i have to change data on the landing page because now its reading POST data
[21:17:57] <Sal> but thats not a problem
[21:18:20] <robertBusy> i thought the landing page was just a generic search result page.
[21:18:20] <Sal> ok, i'll do it that way
[21:18:26] <Sal> no
[21:18:32] <robertBusy> so then what is it?
[21:18:38] <Sal> its a catalog
[21:18:46] <robertBusy> lol
[21:18:57] <robertBusy> is it just pulling records from a DB?
[21:18:57] <Sal> (did i write it correctly) ?
[21:19:39] <Sal> yes, then from that list, clicking on a rowm it applies other filters and shows another page with another list
[21:20:19] <Sal> and on and on to 6 levels
[21:20:48] <Sal> something like, first: from year to year -> shows list of colors used in that year interval
[21:21:18] <Sal> then click on color -> shows manufacturers working in that year interval and that used that color
[21:21:20] <Sal> and so on
[21:21:26] <Sal> anyway, thats
[21:21:58] <Sal> I think i'll do something like: www.site.com/monet/1918/1979
[21:22:00] <robertBusy> yeah, so you have a search page.
[21:22:50] <robertBusy> i'd separate out your form submit page from your search page.
[21:23:32] <Sal> ok, thakns man for your help
[21:24:01] <Sal> its 3:23 here and I want to change the code before going to bed
[21:24:05] <Sal> bye
[21:24:06] <robertBusy> :|
[21:24:13] <robertBusy> go to bed and finish in the morning lol
[21:24:30] <Sal> can't tomorrow they're waiting for it
[21:24:58] <robertBusy> i'll never understand workplaces like that.
[21:38:59] <jak2000> robertmaxxx busy, why?
[21:55:37] <robertBusy> lol
[21:55:45] <robertmaxrees> forgot to switch it back.
