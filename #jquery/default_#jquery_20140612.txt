[00:21:32] <mukesh> morning to all
[00:21:57] <pragma-> I don't want one, thanks.
[00:22:14] <mukesh> how to change window location without page refresh using jquery ajax response
[00:22:43] <Cork> mukesh: you can't with ajax
[00:22:46] <Cork> you use pushState
[00:22:52] <Cork> ?mdn pushState
[00:22:54] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide - Mozilla ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[00:23:11] <mukesh> i have less knowledge of it
[00:25:23] <mukesh> in before i am using qjax to get data on page
[00:26:09] <mukesh> @ crok that's why i am using ajax
[00:26:31] <mukesh> @ b-ot that's why i am using ajax
[00:26:36] <Cork> mukesh: you mixing things up
[00:26:47] <Cork> changing the url has NOTHING to do with ajax
[00:26:57] <Cork> ajax doesn't care and can't modify it
[00:27:15] <Cork> (all ajax cares about is the domain part of the current page)
[00:27:29] <mukesh> let see my page where i am working
[00:27:56] <Cork> sigh...
[00:27:59] <Cork> it doesn't matter
[00:28:07] <mukesh> http://testsite.solomonbrothers.com/diamonds.html
[00:28:15] <Cork> if you want to change the url without reloading the page you need to use pushState or replaceState
[00:28:18] <Cork> ajax can't do it
[00:28:35] <Cork> you might be using a plugin that calls pushState for you
[00:28:43] <Cork> but the core one doesn't
[00:28:50] <mukesh> on right side of page you see btn with view detail
[00:28:54] <mukesh> click on it
[00:30:23] <mukesh> i am using ajax response on same page and after click to back html is chaned accoding to url
[00:30:59] <Cork> then you or some plugin is calling pushState or replaceState
[00:32:30] <mukesh> what happen crok
[00:33:49] <mukesh> ok thanx
[00:53:56] <Amnesia> question, I'm trying to create a handler when my ajax request gets a 302 response, but I'm unable to do so, since jxhqr.status contains 200, which is after the redirect..
[00:54:41] <Amnesia> would there some way to prevent the $.ajax() function to follow the 302 redirect?
[00:55:05] <Amnesia> I've tried the statusCode property aswell without success
[00:56:05] <Cork> Amnesia: the specs explicitly forbids the browser to expose 3xx responses to js
[00:56:30] <Amnesia> I see
[00:56:38] <Amnesia> so what'd you suggest?
[00:57:05] <Cork> Amnesia: you can't prevent xhr calls from following location headers
[00:57:33] <Amnesia> but is it possible to do a check whether a 302 was received at all?
[00:57:47] <Cork> see answer one :)
[00:58:10] <Amnesia> hm shiet
[00:58:32] <Amnesia> well, the reason I'm asking, is because when the users session is timed out, ajax request go into limbo
[00:58:47] <sacho> how do they go into limbo
[00:58:48] <Cork> limbo?
[00:59:00] <Amnesia> from the users perspective:)
[00:59:26] <Cork> Amnesia: if you want to allow ajax calls with a timed out session you have to specify this server side
[00:59:40] <Cork> so the server doesn't do the redirect
[00:59:50] <Cork> js has no control over this
[00:59:51] <Amnesia> hm ok
[00:59:55] <Cork> well at least not content js
[01:00:00] <Cork> extensions can
[01:00:08] <Cork> (in some browsers)
[01:00:21] <Amnesia> thx for your time
[01:00:32] <Amnesia> I'll handle it on the server side:)
[01:04:13] <dave_2> I need to calculate price this is what i've got case1: if a car travels between 1-15 miles then price for first mile is £3 and then for every mile after it price will be £1.60 so for this case i'm calculating like this miles= 1-15 rate=1.60; emile=miles-1; totalprice=miles*1.60+3; case2 if a car travels between 15-30 miles then price will be £ 1.20
[01:04:13] <dave_2> /mile+previous formula so for this case i'm calculating like this rate=1.20; rate2=1.60; cmile=(miles-14)*rate; fmile=(14*rate2+3); totalprice=cmile+fmile; case3:if a car travels between 30-50 miles then price will be £ 1.10/mile+both previous formula now i'm stuck here how do i calculate for 3rd case

[01:14:15] <mukesh> how to change window location without page refresh using jquery ajax response
[02:02:52] <mukesh> help for pushState() plugin
[02:02:58] <mukesh> how to use it
[02:03:14] <mukesh> Changing the browser-URL without refreshing page
[02:11:55] <mukesh> for skope
[02:12:00] <mukesh> is there???
[02:13:07] <socialblogsite> has anyone made a jquery plugin?
[02:13:57] <mukesh> @socialblogsite
[02:14:36] <socialblogsite> mukesh: did you?
[02:26:11] <lite_> what is the term when you "wrap" a html element in jQuery? as in $(element)
[02:26:53] <Jattenalle> lite_, not sure what you mean, selector?
[02:27:01] <lite_> i mean
[02:27:29] <lite_> is it called "invoking it as a jquery object"? "Jquery wrapping" ?
[02:27:58] <Jattenalle> do you mean when doing: var something = $('<div>Stuff</div>'); ?
[02:28:05] <lite_> sure
[02:28:08] <lite_> yes
[02:28:16] <lite_> What am I doing to the div in this case?
[02:28:27] <lite_> "JQuerying it"
[02:28:36] <Jattenalle> you're creating a DOM tree from the HTML you put in
[02:28:48] <Jattenalle> the jquery object you get back is that dom tree, as if you had selected an existing one
[02:29:53] <Jattenalle> i dont think there's a specific name for what it's doing
[02:29:58] <lite_> darn it
[02:30:06] <koell> does someone work with compass in here? there seems no sass channel on freenode :/
[02:30:37] <Jattenalle> any OP's around? kickban spambot kikoop is ~net@90.174.4.237
[02:30:55] <lite_> im doing a code review and trying to explain to him in words that the element he's doing $(element) on is already "jQuery" and as such there's no need for the $(...) wrap
[02:31:12] <Jattenalle> lite_, oh, it also doesnt matter
[02:31:28] <Jattenalle> $($('.something')) = $('.something') afaik
[02:31:31] <lite_> i know
[02:31:37] <lite_> but theres no need for it
[02:31:40] <Jattenalle> aye
[02:39:25] <binarious> Hi, when I do „uglifyjs jquery-2.1.1.js > test.min.js“ I get a 131 KB minified version. But the official one is 84 KB. Why is there such a difference?
[02:53:22] <Cork> binarious: different options maybe?
[03:19:52] <t4nk434> Hello
[03:20:49] <t4nk434> How I can work with variable insted of DOM ?
[03:21:02] <t4nk434> jQuery('#webmailRedactor a').each(function()         { ...}
[03:21:07] <Cork> inside?
[03:21:23] <Cork> you mean inside the each function?
[03:21:25] <t4nk434> I have a var who contain a html code
[03:21:40] <t4nk434> var html="html code"
[03:21:56] <t4nk434> i want search all link inside html var
[03:21:58] <Cork> var dom = $(html); dom.find('').each()
[03:24:02] <t4nk434> O yeah
[03:24:07] <t4nk434> It's work very fine
[03:24:32] <t4nk434> Now, how modify this var ?
[03:24:33] <t4nk434>  var link =  jQuery("a[href$='"+this.href+"']");             var text = link.text();             link.html (text +" ("+this.href+") ");
[03:25:04] <Cork> t4nk434: make a fiddle with what you have and trying to do
[03:28:51] <t4nk434> http://pastebin.com/sfL0wytR
[03:29:44] <Cork> ?down jsfiddle.net
[03:30:10] <t4nk434> I have : <a href="#link1">something</a>,         I want replace by  <a href="#link1"> something (#link1) </a>
[03:30:42] <Cork> t4nk434: make a working demo here http://jsbin.com/gomeliba/1/edit
[03:30:47] <b-ot> Cork: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jsfiddle.net is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[03:31:54] <t4nk434> I just want modify the html var insted of DOM
[03:32:22] <t4nk434> (i can't show you a online script because it's for a very complexe application)
[03:32:33] <jiesse> hello, what do i do wrong to include javascript in this html page ? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vgcem
[03:33:10] <jiesse> i mean, why the script isnt working ?
[03:33:11] <Cork> t4nk434: you mean something like http://jsbin.com/gomeliba/1/edit ?
[03:33:23] <t4nk434> But I have a function who have one parameter (var who contain html value). And i need to modify this var
[03:35:46] <Cork> jiesse: you're missing ); at the end of the ready call
[03:35:58] <Cork> jiesse: also scripts goes at the END of body or in head
[03:36:02] <Cork> not beginning of boddy
[03:36:04] <Cork> *body
[03:36:22] <Cork> jiesse: and lastly use .hide()
[03:36:27] <Cork> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dcoJK
[03:36:47] <Cork> also footer is outside body
[03:36:52] <Cork> (and that isn't valid)
[03:37:10] <Cork> oh and you forgot the doctype
[03:37:19] <tototiti> Cork: alright, codepen said doctype isn't needed*
[03:37:26] <tototiti> Cork: im jiesse got dcd
[03:37:43] <Cork> tote: then they lie
[03:37:43] <t4nk434> I have something like this : http://jsbin.com/yiposave/1/edit
[03:37:46] <Cork> *tototiti:
[03:37:51] <t4nk434> and de html is not modify
[03:38:10] <Cork> t4nk434: you modify the dom you parsed from the html
[03:38:16] <t4nk434> Yes
[03:38:18] <Cork> t4nk434: why do you need the html again?
[03:38:22] <t4nk434> I want modify the html var
[03:38:28] <Cork> ya, but why
[03:38:39] <t4nk434> because the function return html for other traitement
[03:38:41] <Cork> just use the dom you parsed
[03:38:46] <Cork> ugg...
[03:39:00] <Cork> well then you have to serialize the dom variable again
[03:39:20] <t4nk434> I can't work with html var ?
[03:39:27] <Cork> htlp = $('<div>').html(dom).html()
[03:39:36] <Cork> t4nk434: the html variable is a string
[03:39:46] <Cork> sure you can modify it with regexp if you prefer
[03:39:48] <t4nk434> yes, it's my problem
[03:40:00] <t4nk434> jquery not allow me to do this ?
[03:40:10] <Cork> jquery is for dom manipulations
[03:40:17] <Cork> and a string != dom
[03:40:22] <t4nk434> shit
[03:41:01] <Cork> t4nk434: http://jsbin.com/yiposave/2/edit
[03:41:32] <Cork> man all live editors are slow like shit right now...
[03:41:49] <Cork> ah, jsfiddle is up again
[03:43:34] <t4nk434> jQuery.replaceWith can't help me ?
[03:44:20] <Cork> no
[03:44:32] <Cork> it is for replacing a dom element with another dom element
[03:44:57] <binarious> Cork: Resulting in such a big difference? I don’t know.
[03:45:28] <Cork> binarious: try with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L117
[03:45:57] <t4nk434> http://jsfiddle.net/SLaks/Q6VNH/
[03:46:03] <t4nk434> look
[03:46:31] <binarious> Cork: Ah great, thanks!
[04:01:19] <titii> Hi. little OT: how to play mp4 video on the website XHTML 4...? ty
[04:02:44] <Cork> titii: why not just change it to <doctype html>?
[04:03:27] <titii> Cork: because i am not compettent to make it. I cant
[04:03:44] <titii> cork: it is a big project
[04:03:49] <Cork> titii: you can change one line in a file?
[04:04:04] <Cork> titii: then your restricted to using <embed> and <object>
[04:04:13] <Cork> at least if you want the page to validate
[04:04:25] <Cork> titii: btw xhtml 4...
[04:04:31] <Cork> there is no xhtml 4 pages
[04:04:52] <Cork> there is xhtml 1.0 and 1.1
[04:05:06] <Cork> and 99.9% of all pages with xhtml doctype is actually just broken html pages
[04:05:19] <StephenS> jQ
[04:06:52] <bongjovi> What would be the best way to compare the values of two objects with matching  properties and evaluate true if all the properties with exisiting values are the same?
[04:08:02] <Cork> bongjovi: there isn't really a good way to do that
[04:08:36] <Cork> bongjovi: in moderately modern browsers you can do if(Object.keys(obj1).length === Object.keys(obj1).length) {}
[04:08:58] <Cork> and if it is loop the first object and check if the value of it is the same as the one from the second
[04:09:13] <Cork> bongjovi: don't forget that you might have to handle multilevel objects
[04:09:25] <Cork> (or nested objects)
[04:12:39] <bongjovi> Ah okay
[04:12:43] <bongjovi> think i've figured it out..
[04:12:44] <bongjovi> thanks
[04:15:23] <wishypw> hi guys, any ideas why the following code wouldn't work: http://pastebin.com/E4aVRvZc
[04:17:29] <paulvd> wishypw: a jsfiddle would be better
[04:19:44] <Cork> wishypw: most likely cause you run the event listener before the element exist
[04:20:27] <Cork> wishypw: and side notes: 1. use .hide() instead of .css('display...) 2. don't use return false; use event.preventDefault();
[04:22:13] <wishypw> thanks guys, i'll look into it
[04:22:59] <Cork> wishypw: another possible cause is that you have another event listener with return false; on the same element
[04:23:08] <Cork> and that would prevent your event listener from working
[04:29:52] <abishek> anybody know a plugin to convert png to svg?
[04:30:23] <bberry> is doing document.querySelector("#myID") the same as $("#myID")? (as far as selecting dom elements, obviously the latter will have all the jquery functionality)
[04:30:57] <Cork> abishek: you can't really do a convertion from png to svg
[04:31:03] <Cork> the other way around is doable
[04:31:06] <wishypw> guys, thanks again - i've partially fixed my issue
[04:31:41] <Cork> abishek: there are some projects that are trying to convert blank and white rastered imaged to svg
[04:31:46] <Cork> but that isn't in js
[04:34:11] <bberry> Hmm. it looks like document.querySelector only will return a single element
[04:34:38] <bberry> ah, querySelectorAll
[04:34:39] <Cork> bberry: querySelectorAll
[04:34:40] <Cork> ya
[04:35:55] <bberry> before knowing that function, i thought jquery was absolutely magical in the use of its selectors. i had no idea how it did it lol
[04:36:19] <bberry> well. obviously it could walk the DOM and find it that way. but screw that lol
[04:36:34] <Cork> bberry: well if you go back a few versions it was actually a lot more tinkery to get things working
[04:36:57] <Cork> ie5.5 doesn't have querySelector*
[04:37:06] <bberry> i see. yeah it looks like querySelector is ie8+
[04:37:21] <Cork> docuemnt.all[] WTF... (NOT!!!)
[04:37:26] <bberry> lol
[04:38:12] <Cork> sadly we're going to be stuck with parts of the msdom legacy for ever
[04:38:40] <seutje> DOM = dumb in Dutch
[04:38:43] <seutje> just saying...
[04:39:31] <Cork> can't wait for let to land cross browsers
[04:40:40] <bberry> id like to know the percentage of users with ie7- at this point
[04:41:06] <Cork> bberry: well you can get ruff estimates
[04:41:09] <bberry> i wonder what XP has in its base install
[04:41:25] <Cork> ie6
[04:41:28] <bberry> eesh
[04:41:34] <bberry> well, at least thats not supported anyway
[04:41:36] <bberry> anymore*
[04:41:39] <Cork> xp is dead though
[04:41:50] <bberry> a few of our customers are still using it
[04:41:52] * Cork danses on its grave
[04:41:52] <bberry> so i have to support ie8
[04:42:09] <Cork> ouch
[04:42:14] <bberry> which, isnt super terrible, but its terrible
[04:42:26] <Cork> bberry: get them to use a different browser
[04:42:38] <Cork> chrome or firefox works fine and is a lot better then ie8
[04:43:10] <bberry> ideally id just tell the customers that our web app doesnt work on anything other than chrome/firefox
[04:43:31] <bberry> and maybe ie11
[04:43:40] <Cork> ie10 is "ok" too
[04:43:43] <bberry> yeah
[04:43:48] <Cork> ie9 is doable
[04:43:52] <Cork> ie8... noway
[04:43:56] <bberry> yeah those at least have the array iterators and such
[04:44:07] <Cork> older.. your kidding right?
[04:44:40] <Cork> bberry: i wrote a page about 4 years back
[04:44:49] <bberry> lol. honestly we havent been very... hmm... strict in our support for ie8
[04:44:51] <Cork> it had the criterias "has to work for everyone"
[04:44:59] <bberry> LOL
[04:45:05] <Cork> it was... fun getting it to work in ie4 T_T
[04:45:06] <bberry> inb4 netscape
[04:45:18] <bberry> thats terrible
[04:45:24] <Cork> oh, :hover? sorry not supported
[04:45:28] <bberry> lol.
[04:45:38] <bberry> sadly i cant use :hover in my project
[04:45:38] <Cork> click events? only on links
[04:45:46] <bberry> just because we're trying to support ipad
[04:46:02] <bberry> wow! no button click events. thats terrible
[04:46:06] <Cork> well :hover is find if it is for styling
[04:46:07] <bberry> how do buttons even function then
[04:46:12] <Cork> but ya nothing else
[04:46:20] <bberry> yeah, we were using it for tooltip kind of things
[04:46:30] <Cork> bberry: well <button> didn't exist
[04:46:40] <bberry> <input type="button"/>?
[04:46:41] <Cork> but sure <input type="submit"> supports click
[04:46:44] <Cork> nope
[04:46:47] <bberry> lol ouch
[04:46:53] <Cork> ya it was special...
[04:46:56] <bberry> i bet.
[04:47:02] <Cork> having to use tables for EVERYTHING
[04:47:15] <bberry> could you at least CSS an <a> to make it look like a button? Or did CSS suck terribly back then too?
[04:47:21] <Cork> absolute positioned uls for dropdowns - has to be wrapped in a table...
[04:47:29] <bberry> LOL
[04:47:34] <Cork> else it doens't work in pre ie6
[04:47:35] <bberry> ./wrists
[04:48:09] <Cork> after that project landed i desided "N-E-V-E-R A-G-A-I-N!!!"
[04:48:13] <bberry> i wonder how much money that project lost just in research for trying to figure out what was supported and what wasnt
[04:48:43] <Cork> bberry: "modern browsers" from back then took about a months to develop
[04:48:53] <Cork> ie6 3 weeks
[04:48:59] <Cork> 5.5 additional 2 weeks
[04:49:07] <Cork> and ie4 about an additional month
[04:49:11] <bberry> lol
[04:49:59] <bberry> sadly my first web app isnt a simple page
[04:50:07] <bberry> so i've made about a million mistakes
[04:50:49] <bberry> i finally convinced my project manager to rewrite an entire page. its about 3k lines of code
[04:51:00] <bberry> i reduced it to 1.3k.
[04:51:13] <bberry> (for html/css/js combined)
[04:51:57] <bberry> i look at my old code and am amazed that customers are actually using it
[04:52:24] <Cork> bberry: btw http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0
[04:52:32] <Cork> ie6 3.55%
[04:52:41] <Cork> ie7 0.68%
[04:52:53] <bberry> *sigh*
[04:53:05] <bberry> im surprised that ie8 is so high
[04:53:10] <Cork> though ya those are only ruff estimates
[04:53:24] <Cork> i'm not
[04:54:03] <bberry> well. im not. but its like. holy crap, update already.
[04:54:15] <Cork> :D
[04:54:46] <bberry> sadly that is kind of vain to say given my profession. XD
[04:58:29] <Cork> bberry: the problem is quickly turning from it to mobile safari and android browsers
[04:59:03] <Cork> those are some crappy browsers and are rarely even possible to update
[05:00:20] <bberry> yeah
[05:00:57] <bberry> maybe 5 years or so from now, 90%+  will be using ie9
[05:01:07] <bberry> ie9+
[05:01:08] <Cork> not likely
[05:01:10] <m4strmindwork> bberry, ie8 sticking around so long is microsofts fault.  a lot of businesses dont want the cost to upgrade to windows 7 or 8 and you cant get ie9 on XP
[05:01:16] <bberry> shh, dont crush my dreams :P
[05:01:19] <Cork> or if you meant 90% of all ie users
[05:01:22] <Cork> possibly
[05:01:33] <bberry> oh, yeah thats what i meant
[05:01:53] <m4strmindwork> ie9 will have a MUCH shorter life cycle than 8 because ie9 is not tied to any OS version
[05:01:57] <Cork> m4strmindwork: well xp isn't supported at all anymore (except for in some very special cases)
[05:02:19] <m4strmindwork> government still uses xp a lot
[05:02:33] <Cork> m4strmindwork: depends on where you are
[05:02:40] <m4strmindwork> right
[05:02:55] <Cork> but there is some quite severe security bugs in it that is flagged as "won't fix"
[05:03:15] <Cork> so ... xp shouldn't be connected to the public net anymore
[05:03:20] <Cork> that isn't even close to safe
[05:03:24] <bberry> yeah. i'm hoping now that xp isnt supported, companies will be forced to make the move over the next few years
[05:03:40] <Cork> bberry: many do
[05:04:02] <Cork> and many still run a xp version in a vm
[05:04:05] <bberry> what does Windows 7 have on base install?
[05:04:07] <Cork> for legacy apps :)
[05:04:08] <bberry> 9?
[05:04:13] <Cork> ya
[05:04:23] <Cork> vista was 7
[05:04:26] <bberry> does ie9 auto update?
[05:04:35] <Cork> no
[05:04:42] <bberry> dang.
[05:04:48] <Cork> it is part of the system update system
[05:04:56] <Cork> as a package you can opt out from
[05:05:02] <bberry> lovely
[05:05:04] <Cork> bberry: note ie isn't a browser
[05:05:22] <Cork> it is a little exefile that calls into system files
[05:05:30] <Cork> it is all system dlls (even the ui)
[05:05:34] <bberry> true. i feel like that is why windows is so at odds with firefox and chrome
[05:05:42] <Cork> ya
[05:05:51] <Cork> and it is why it has such a hard time with security
[05:05:54] <bberry> yeah
[05:06:04] <Cork> so segmentation between trusted and untrusted code
[05:06:18] <bberry> probably why it cant get performance up too
[05:07:02] <Cork> no it is just cause old ie is just terribly slow
[05:07:48] <m4strmindwork> though honestly, i'd rather code for ie6 than outlook.  outlook is BAD
[05:08:02] <Cork> m4strmindwork: lol true
[05:08:06] <Cork> been there done that
[05:08:17] <Cork> lets all render html in WORD!
[05:08:21] <Cork> -_-
[05:08:24] <bberry> lol
[05:08:47] <Cork> outlook 2000 was actually ok to write html for
[05:08:59] <m4strmindwork> outlook is horribad
[05:09:04] <Cork> then ms thought na, lets use word for rendering instead!
[05:09:17] <Cork> why use ie that is ACTUALLY A BROWSER
[05:09:46] <m4strmindwork> it makes sense from m$'s point of view they use word to generate the emails and they wanted it to look the same when viewed
[05:10:00] <m4strmindwork> but its still dumb.
[05:10:22] <Cork> it would have been "ok"-ish if they fixed words html
[05:10:29] <Cork> to actually be html and not mshtml
[05:10:36] <Cork> with all its "no you can't have backgrounds
[05:10:44] <Cork> "nope no css here"
[05:10:51] <Cork> and.. UUUUUGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!AAAAAAAAAA!
[05:11:01] <Cork> *killl mee!!!* >_>
[05:11:52] <m4strmindwork> outlook doesnt understand padding on a div, you have to use a table
[05:11:55] <m4strmindwork> lol
[05:12:01] <Cork> ya i know
[05:12:21] <Cork> the list of what sane normal things you can't do in word is just... ugg...
[05:12:36] <m4strmindwork> and believe it or not, outlook.com is worse
[05:12:44] <m4strmindwork> aka hotmail
[05:12:54] <bberry> *sigh* here we go. cross compiling php
[05:13:28] <bberry> oops, wrong ch
[05:13:34] <Cork> m4strmindwork: haven't done html mail since before the online existed
[05:13:50] <Cork> so luckily haven't had to care
[05:15:35] <ph88> can i request a fresh (non-cached) version of a page with AJAX ?
[05:15:51] <Cork> ph88: sure
[05:16:05] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { cache: false })
[05:16:16] <seutje> you can cache: false it or just append a random querystring urself
[05:16:30] <seutje> it's pretty much what it does anyway
[05:16:35] <Cork> and that is what jqeury does anymore
[05:16:51] <ph88> great guys
[05:16:56] <Cork> http://example.com/url/som.php?_=datetimestamp
[05:17:51] <ph88> can i also reload the current page and request a fresh page ?
[05:18:18] <Cork> document.location.reload() should do it
[05:18:18] <ph88> i'm trying to make a page that stays cached most of the time, unless the user hits a refresh button on the page
[05:18:50] <ph88> so first   $.ajax(url, { cache: false })  and discard the response .. and then document.location.reload()  ?
[05:18:55] <Cork> ph88: just have the server set the expire header
[05:20:56] <ph88> ok so    first request non-cached page and have server return a short expire header, then reload page ?
[05:22:19] <Cork> ph88: either that or just have the server check the update date and return a 304
[05:22:39] <Cork> the browser will use the cache it has if the server sends a 304
[05:24:06] <ph88> oh Cork it's _only_ about server cache
[05:24:15] <bePolite> Please how can I check if a jquery object has another object?
[05:24:20] <ph88> sorry that i didn't mention this :(
[05:24:29] <Cork> ph88: what do you mean?
[05:24:30] <bePolite> eg  if ( $('p').has('x')) do ...
[05:25:00] <ph88> Cork: i mean can the client set something special in the request so that the reverse proxy knows if it should server up a cached page or ask the application to generate a new page
[05:25:01] <Cork> bePolite: you want to check if a there is a child element of a specific type inside the target?
[05:25:47] <bePolite> Yes Cork
[05:25:50] <bePolite> thats it
[05:26:11] <Cork> ph88: it can send from when its last update was
[05:26:32] <Cork> ph88: the rest depends on server side actually knowing when things changed (or when it should expire)
[05:26:44] <Cork> bePolite: and where are you using this?
[05:27:13] <bePolite> In an event
[05:27:20] <ph88> Cork: so there is no header to indicate the client would like a fresh version? Because i would like to make a button on the page to force a refresh on the server
[05:27:37] <Cork> bePolite: $(this).find('x').length > 0
[05:28:19] <Cork> there is a no-cache header
[05:28:25] <Cork> but i don't remember if the client can set that
[05:28:36] <ph88> hhmmzz
[05:29:17] <Cork> ph88: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9

[05:43:24] <Rickardo1> Is it possible to have concatenate jquery and dependent plugins in same file or must query be loaded before?
[05:43:54] <Cork> Rickardo1: as long as the plugin is written according to spec it should work just fine
[05:44:11] <Cork> but the plugin has to be concated after the jquery blob
[05:44:58] <Rickardo1> Cork: Ok, I get undefined error on some plugins when loaded in same file but not if they loaded in a separate <script after jquery
[05:45:31] <Cork> Rickardo1: the plugin concated before that script most likely isn't closing things off correctly
[05:45:36] <seutje> Cork: it's not so bad...
[05:45:45] * seutje wanders around outside in the sunshines
[05:46:01] <Cork> Rickardo1: an alternative is to make sure that you append an \n after each script
[05:46:20] <Rickardo1> Cork, ok I'm using grunt and concat ..
[05:47:09] <Rickardo1> Cork: But I can live with 2 requests.. had 12 before..
[05:47:30] <Cork> Rickardo1: it is an easy problem to fix
[05:47:46] <Cork> you just have to identify where the missing ; is
[05:48:09] <Rickardo1> Cork: ok, ty.. I put it to a low prio task for now..
[05:49:42] <konda> Is there any opposite function to event.stopPropagation? I hade an eventhandler on my body, and I don't want it to spread down the DOM tree ;) Does anyone know if there is anyway to solve this?
[05:50:04] <Cork> konda: no
[05:50:09] <konda> I have it on my body, and I don't want it to affect the div.
[05:50:18] <Cork> you can fire the event again as a fake event
[05:50:24] <Cork> but that is about it
[05:50:49] <konda> like call it again on my div but the opposite of the event I have on my body?
[05:51:14] <Cork> konda: kinda, but this is a VERY hacky solution
[05:51:22] <konda> I have animate(opacity 0.25) on my body and I dont want it to affect my div
[05:51:26] <Cork> just remove the stopPropagation call and solve it correctly
[05:51:26] <konda> okey
[05:51:33] <konda> do you know any better solution?
[05:51:56] <Cork> konda: check event.target in the event handlers you want to exclude the target from
[05:52:25] <konda> okey!
[05:52:28] <Cork> $(event.target).closet('.exclude-these').length > 0
[05:52:33] <konda> thanks, Im gonna check it :)
[05:52:42] <Cork> *closest
[05:53:46] <bberry> is there a way to make an event capture instead of bubble?
[05:54:08] <Cork> not cross browsers
[05:54:19] <Cork> (and there for not in jquery)
[05:54:32] <bberry> ah, yeah IE (of course) is bubble only
[05:54:52] <Cork> well ie pre 9
[05:55:04] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener#Browser_compatibility
[05:55:14] <bberry> yeah
[05:55:44] <bberry> so, konda, if you wanted to use javascript and support ie9+, theres a better way to do it
[05:56:11] <konda> okey
[05:56:24] <konda> Im trying to find solutions like .children or such but I dont know if its the best way
[05:56:52] <konda> which one is the way you would recommend?
[05:57:50] <bberry> what are you trying to do with puttin an event handler on the body
[05:58:31] <Cork> delegated event listening most likely
[05:58:37] <konda> Im making a lightbox, so I have an .animate({opacity 0.25}) on the body, and I dont want it to spread down to the div I have centered in the body
[05:59:10] <Cork> konda: just add an if statement in the event handler
[05:59:25] <Cork> should be the simplest solution
[06:00:25] <konda> how do you mean? I want it to execute in every case, but I only want it to affect the body
[06:01:05] <bberry> konda, cant you just do $("#body").on("click", function(){})
[06:01:07] <bberry> oops
[06:01:39] <konda> yes, but then it also affects my div
[06:01:44] <bberry> $("#body").on("click", function(){ $(this).animate({ ... }); })
[06:01:46] <konda> sek I make a jsfiddle :)
[06:01:48] <bberry> kk
[06:02:13] <zafu> hi, anyone using FB's js sdk for login ?
[06:03:12] <Cork> konda: $("#body").on("click", function(event){ if($(event.target).closest('div').length > 0) { return; } $(this).animate({ ... }); })
[06:03:20] <Cork> konda: that should prevent that
[06:03:38] <konda> http://jsfiddle.net/konda/9cXUw/
[06:04:10] <konda> my problem is that it is also "opaciting" the black div
[06:04:33] <Cork> ah
[06:04:39] <Cork> that has nothing to do with events
[06:04:42] <bberry> lol yeah
[06:04:45] <bberry> the body holds EVERYTHING
[06:04:48] <Cork> opacity effects all children
[06:04:51] <Cork> always
[06:04:57] <Cork> you can't ever override that
[06:05:13] <konda> aha okey
[06:05:14] <Cork> only way is to add a wrapper for everything except the element you don't want to do it for
[06:05:15] <konda> that sucks ;D
[06:05:32] <Cork> and then put the opacity on it
[06:05:36] <konda> aha oeky
[06:05:48] <konda> so I will have to make a div to cover the whole page I guess
[06:06:02] <konda> and animate that one
[06:06:07] <konda> but thanks for your help :)
[06:06:09] <Cork> with the exceptions for the element you don't want to do it for ya
[06:06:19] <konda> yes exactly
[06:14:09] <sergey> Hi. How at this theme http://easysite.by/vernissage/ he keep background good on low window width?
[06:19:01] <sergey> I mean http://joxi.ru/oaiZU_3JTJC9PfM4jrM and http://joxi.ru/wKiZU_3JTJAsYw6IeB0
[06:26:31] <dave_2> http://jsfiddle.net/wGjxQ/ if any td is selected(clicked) then option should be checked how do  i do it
[06:41:21] <sergey> Cork: Hi. are you around?
[06:41:47] <Cork> sergey: sure
[06:43:10] <sergey> Cork: can you please help me with getting how to keep good background? I posted my problem a few messages earlier
[06:44:47] <Cork> sergey: not sure what you mean but prob an <img> or background-size:
[06:53:00] <haemly> Hello, Im having trouble trying to get a div to scrollLeft. So I click a button, an image is loaded into the div, which will set the containers div size, but im trying to scrollLeft on that div too, but its not working
[06:53:20] <haemly> Im assuming I have to wait till the img is loaded, and the div size is initialized, so the scrolLeft will work, but im not sure how to do htis
[07:05:22] <Dawei4444> Hello all
[07:05:49] <Dawei4444> I was wondering if someone could give me a quick explanation of what function(x, y) is used for?
[07:05:56] <Dawei4444> in terms of loops
[07:10:14] <NoiseEee> Dawei4444: the question doesn't quite make sense
[07:14:42] <Kenzi`> Has any of you tried this course? http://try.jquery.com/ Is it worth the 3 hours?
[07:15:19] <Dawei4444> NoiseEee: in this context? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ETqr8bMy I'm just curious as to the purpose it serves
[07:16:18] <decx> 3 hours is a bit generous
[07:17:47] <NoiseEee> Dawei4444: this should help explain it http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[07:17:57] <Dawei4444> Thank you :)
[07:20:19] <aro> how do i remotely load another JS file? (i would like to load from cache if possible)
[07:21:40] <aro> nvm
[07:21:42] <aro> PEACE OUT
[07:23:09] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:31:13] <antlong_> does vex.js require a shim when using require.js? is there some special way to use this?
[07:31:41] <v2zz> what is the order of iteration with $.each? random?
[07:31:51] <krambiorix> hi, in a datable i have 10 columns, 2 of them are date fields... How can i filter like : between date1 and date2 ?
[07:36:56] <MikeD_> if I have 3 inputs and want to know if any one of them has a value, what's the easy way to check for that?  .each() ?
[07:40:40] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: You could do like $('input').filter(function(){ this.value === 'foo'; }).length
[07:41:42] <shoky> forgot a "return" there ;p
[07:42:19] <MikeD_> thanks
[07:42:57] <BillCriswell> True.
[07:43:09] <MikeD_> if I had a lot of elements, would returning false in an .each() provide an early exit instead of filtering the whole bunch?
[07:43:29] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:44:19] <BillCriswell> It would be cool if .first() took a function to do something like that.
[07:44:54] <sacho> Array.prototype.some() (:
[07:45:20] <BillCriswell> That's that new fancy JS dohickies.
[07:46:08] <BillCriswell> Is there a .any? That feels like a better name maybe?
[07:46:38] <BillCriswell> Ah, IE9 has some. So that's good.
[07:46:44] <sacho> there's .some() and .every()
[07:46:51] <sacho> you can easily shim them too
[07:47:07] <MikeD_> given i'm looking for a non-empty input value, could I put that into the selector?
[07:47:15] <sacho> sure
[07:47:19] <shoky> if you want runtime value, no
[07:47:23] <MikeD_> "well damn!"
[07:47:30] <MikeD_> oh
[07:47:36] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, I think the attribute selector would look at what was set on load.
[07:48:24] <BillCriswell> The value attribute and not the value property.
[07:48:46] <BillCriswell> sacho: .some sounds misleading to me. I would think that meant more than one?
[07:48:56] <sacho> "at least one"
[07:49:10] <shoky> The some() method tests whether some element in the array passes the test
[07:49:26] <BillCriswell> I understand what it's doing haha.
[07:49:34] <BillCriswell> I'm just questioning the name.
[07:49:45] <MikeD_> yeah, how is some() different than any() ?
[07:49:48] <shoky> yeah, i pasted that to show how the name is used in a sentence
[07:49:51] <shoky> "some element"
[07:49:53] <BillCriswell> There is no .any
[07:50:02] <MikeD_> oh, that's different then.
[07:50:25] <BillCriswell> The definition of "some" is "an unspecified amount or number of."
[07:50:37] <shoky> not when used like in that sentence :P
[07:50:45] <BillCriswell> Words are stupid.
[07:50:46] <MikeD_> "some people"
[07:50:51] <shoky> "some person"
[07:51:02] <Forbidd3n> Is this not possible or is my context wrong? $('.teaser').css({top: $(this).attr('top')});
[07:51:04] <MikeD_> "That's some outfit"
[07:51:19] <jParkton> lol
[07:51:30] <BillCriswell> You could say that to a naked person and it could mean no outfit.
[07:51:46] <shoky> Forbidd3n  $(this) is probably not what you think it is, there
[07:51:59] <jParkton> you two need to watch Cirano De Burgerack or whatever his name was
[07:52:07] <jParkton> he was rather artful with words
[07:52:07] <shoky> Forbidd3n try using .css with a function
[07:52:25] <BillCriswell> His last name has the word Burger in it so I'm interested.
[07:52:31] <Forbidd3n> shoky: would you mind and example please?
[07:53:05] <shoky> Forbidd3n: .css('top', function() { return $(this).attr('top') })
[07:53:25] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/css/#css-propertyName-function
[07:53:35] <jParkton> shoky: I have a question about arrays, when I use join() on an array it will give me item1,item2,item3 when I do join(" ") it is "item1 item2 item3" why is that? What am I joining really?
[07:53:43] <Forbidd3n> gotcha, thanks
[07:53:54] <BillCriswell> jParkton: The items in the array together.
[07:54:08] <BillCriswell> PHP calls that parameter the "glue" if that helps clear it up.
[07:54:15] <jParkton> lol
[07:54:21] <MikeD_> the default value for join is ","
[07:54:22] <jParkton> but like....
[07:54:47] <jParkton> so when I pass " " it tells it to use a space instead of , ?
[07:54:55] <shoky> yup
[07:54:55] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Yes.
[07:55:00] <jParkton> holy....
[07:55:03] <jParkton> ok good
[07:55:10] <jParkton> so I am getting some of this lol
[07:55:17] <MikeD_> ikr, join() is pretty awesome
[07:55:18] <BillCriswell> [1,2,3].join("BUTTS") would give you 1BUTTS2BUTTS3
[07:55:23] <jParkton> I have no prev exp with programming
[07:55:24] <shoky> jParkton: you can read all of this in the docs for join() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
[07:55:34] <jParkton> oh danke
[07:55:36] <MikeD_> .split() is the reverse of join()
[07:55:55] <jParkton> BillCriswell: that could be useful
[07:55:58] <jParkton> :)
[07:56:05] <MikeD_> i like those terms so much more than php's implode/explode
[07:57:10] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I don't think it's too bad, but the argument order of them bothers me.
[07:57:16] <BillCriswell> No matter what I always get argument order wrong.
[07:57:42] <BillCriswell> PHP does have a "split" as well, though.
[07:57:53] <BillCriswell> Ah they have join too.
[07:58:00] <BillCriswell> Just aliases of implode/explode
[07:58:03] <jParkton> I cant split it
[07:58:07] <jParkton> yet!
[07:58:41] <Forbidd3n> shoky: this isn't setting the element to the top position being set, it is getting the attribute but the element isn't going to the top set position. If I set it in the css it works fine - $('.teaser').css('top', function() { return $(this).attr('top') });
[07:59:11] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Is it absolutely or fixed positioned?
[07:59:17] <Forbidd3n> yeah, in the css
[07:59:23] <Forbidd3n> absolute
[07:59:24] <shoky> Forbidd3n: what is the top attribute set to
[07:59:39] <Forbidd3n> in the attribute it is set to 150
[07:59:48] <BillCriswell> You need to have the "px" in the top attribute, or add it to the return of the function.
[08:00:04] <BillCriswell> You should also use data-top="150" probably.
[08:00:05] <Forbidd3n> and it is not moving anywhere, but if I set the top in the css on .teaser it puts it in the right position
[08:00:23] <Forbidd3n> not using skrollr
[08:00:35] <shoky> what BillCriswell said. if it still doesn't work make a jsfiddle
[08:00:40] <Forbidd3n> ok
[08:07:55] <Forbidd3n> shoky: here is a simple example
[08:07:56] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/A39wt/
[08:08:41] <shoky> Forbidd3n: and did you try what BillCriswell said
[08:08:59] <BillCriswell> Specifically "You need to have the "px" in the top attribute, or add it to the return of the function."
[08:12:57] <bongjovi> Is there any equivilent function to jQuery.isEmptyObject which checks for values only (not properties)
[08:13:04] <bongjovi> ?
[08:13:44] <shoky> doubt it
[08:14:24] <bongjovi> okay, thanks
[08:15:43] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: thanks
[08:15:56] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:16:07] <tw2113> BillCriswell, you're our hero!
[08:16:50] <antlong_> bill is the man
[08:19:48] <BillCriswell> When do I get my tiara?
[08:20:15] <tw2113> no tiara for you! you get a cursed diadem
[08:20:22] <tw2113> ignore the throbbing pains it may cause
[08:20:27] <tw2113> it's just someone we can't name
[08:20:56] <acidjazz> you just went full anal
[08:21:03] <BillCriswell> I had to google that word.
[08:21:06] <BillCriswell> "diadem"
[08:21:09] <Kenzi`> what, anal?
[08:21:09] <BillCriswell> Good word.
[08:21:10] <Kenzi`> ah
[08:21:30] <BillCriswell> HAha
[08:21:40] <tw2113> just citing Harry Potter, spoiler alert
[08:22:06] <BillCriswell> Never cared for Harry Potter so I'm good!
[08:22:45] <tw2113> only way i knew about diadem was because someone says it's like a tiara in the story
[08:23:20] <jParkton> BillCriswell: a cult I used to be in wore diadems to the getherings
[08:23:26] <jParkton> they were weird
[08:23:46] <jParkton> ours were made of linen
[08:23:53] <Jattenalle> "a cult I used to be in"
[08:23:56] <jParkton> kinda like a hippy headband thing
[08:24:02] <BillCriswell> They were weird only after the diadems?
[08:24:03] <jParkton> dont judge me
[08:24:06] <Jattenalle> you can't just blurt something like that out without telling us more :P
[08:24:08] <jParkton> I got out
[08:24:24] <tw2113> and things just got weird
[08:24:34] <jParkton> neh
[08:24:53] <Jattenalle> "Welcome to jQuery, please only serious diadem cult discussion in the main channel"
[08:25:30] <Jattenalle> really though jParkton, mind telling more? i'm genuinely curious
[08:25:35] <Jattenalle> if you dont want to, it's fine
[08:25:37] <drej> yeah, lets hear about the cult
[08:25:54] <drej> did you have multiple wives?
[08:26:05] <MikeD_> Wicca's not a cult, but the 'gatherings' can get weird
[08:26:20] <jParkton> it was the twelve tribes communities
[08:26:22] <drej> "weird" probably doesnt begin to cover it
[08:26:29] <BillCriswell> No one is sick enough to have more than one wife.
[08:26:32] <drej> http://twelvetribes.com/
[08:26:41] <drej> jParkton you could've at least built them a better site
[08:26:42] <drej> damn
[08:26:46] <jParkton> lol
[08:26:52] <jParkton> I was not on that side
[08:27:01] <jParkton> I was a baker
[08:27:06] <jParkton> and musician
[08:27:18] <jParkton> I have been in a few cults
[08:27:18] <drej> 30 or so @import render-blocking css files
[08:27:20] <drej> COME ON
[08:27:22] <Jattenalle> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_%28ship%29 they have a fleet!
[08:27:28] <jParkton> its something to do with my being an orphan
[08:27:34] <jParkton> teen runaway yadda yadda
[08:27:45] <Jattenalle> sounds fascinating, honestly
[08:27:59] <jParkton> heh
[08:28:21] <drej> jParkton you should write a book
[08:28:32] <drej> "how i spent my youth in random cults, and learned jQuery"
[08:28:38] <MikeD_> i didn't want to get caught in the company web proxy, so I did this just to get a sample:  https://www.google.com/#q=site:twelvetribes.com
[08:28:43] <Jattenalle> "... as a baker musician"
[08:28:48] <drej> *baked musician
[08:28:49] <drej> :)
[08:28:56] <Jattenalle> what you did there drej, i see it ;)
[08:29:44] <jParkton> I followed the dead for a while
[08:29:49] <jParkton> thats where I met the TT
[08:30:10] <jParkton> I should write a book but im not good enough
[08:30:16] <jParkton> would be fun lol
[08:30:25] <drej> you followed the dead?
[08:30:31] <Jattenalle> is that a problem?
[08:30:35] <Jattenalle> like, do they move a lot?
[08:30:40] <drej> so... you just hung out at cemeteries a lot ?
[08:30:42] <Jattenalle> i'd think dead would be pretty easy to keep up with
[08:30:45] <drej> Jattenalle no no, thats the UNdead
[08:30:50] <Jattenalle> ^^
[08:30:52] <Jattenalle> :P
[08:31:04] <drej> hopefully jParkton doesnt think we're making fun of him
[08:31:07] <drej> but just jesting a little
[08:31:23] <jParkton> nahh
[08:31:38] <jParkton> im ok, it is a difficult part of my life but im healing lol
[08:31:46] <jParkton> im a bit cray
[08:31:52] * drej hugs jParkton 
[08:31:58] <drej> we all are
[08:32:01] <jParkton> but im trying to learn js so I can become a developer
[08:32:07] <jParkton> make something of me
[08:32:19] <BillCriswell> My grandmother tried to take me to church once and she regretted it. I was like 5 at the time. Haven't been back since.
[08:32:30] <drej> i never went to church in my life
[08:32:39] <MikeD_> tbh, having some life experience makes you a more interesting candidate in an interview
[08:32:40] <jParkton> f churches
[08:33:02] <jParkton> Religion teaches a man to pray for food while starving to death
[08:33:17] <drej> although i did get kicked out of st.peters basilica
[08:33:22] <jParkton> yeah I usually ace interviews lol
[08:33:29] <drej> because i tripped over something and said "jesus christ!"
[08:33:30] <jParkton> im a really easy to talk to person
[08:33:32] <drej> and then i got ushered out
[08:33:40] <drej> true story
[08:33:44] <jParkton> lol
[08:34:02] <drej> MikeD_ life experience = church? what ?
[08:34:14] <drej> or you mean jParkton 's sordid history
[08:34:20] <jParkton> sordid lol
[08:34:30] <drej> :)
[08:34:39] <jParkton> hippyplace.org I made
[08:34:45] <jParkton> its nubly
[08:34:52] <jParkton> or jparkton.github.io
[08:34:59] <drej> nubly definitely describes it
[08:35:00] <jParkton> I WILL IMPROVE!
[08:35:11] <Jattenalle> hey now
[08:35:16] <Jattenalle> even with those absurd colors
[08:35:27] <Jattenalle> at least yuo didnt go with bright green background, and yellow text or something like that
[08:35:35] <Jattenalle> and no dancingflower.gif's
[08:35:35] <jParkton> yeah lol it looked nicer with foundation template, but I started it from scratch just want to use it to learn
[08:35:42] <drej> every site needs a dancingflower.gif
[08:36:00] <Jattenalle> drej, spinningskull.gif, snowflakes.js, pentagram.gif
[08:36:01] <Jattenalle> :P
[08:36:06] <Jattenalle> geocities, such memories.
[08:36:07] <jParkton> I was just experimenting with the linear-gradient thing and got carried away lol
[08:36:13] <jParkton> yuk
[08:36:19] <jParkton> I still hate geosites
[08:36:29] <jParkton> although I hear Yahoo has some js mvc?
[08:36:38] <jParkton> is it just as crappy?
[08:36:41] <BillCriswell> I try to really relax during interviews which makes me seem like I don't care, but it's really the only way I can stop myself from confusing people because my brain moves quicker than my mouth.
[08:36:55] <BillCriswell> I should pretend to be mute and type at interviews.
[08:37:00] <drej> i should post the first website i ever did in here
[08:37:01] <drej> for a client
[08:37:02] <drej> 1996
[08:37:05] <jParkton> Oh drej I was also in the hare krsnas and the buddhist niponzen myohoji thing
[08:37:06] <drej> animated gif seperators
[08:37:08] <drej> MIDI in the backgorund
[08:37:10] <drej> good times
[08:37:12] <jParkton> and ananda marga
[08:37:15] <jParkton> lol
[08:37:17] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, hah
[08:37:41] <drej> Jattenalle https://web.archive.org/web/19970412063015/http://labelling.com/
[08:37:42] <drej> bam.
[08:37:49] <drej> marquee, animated seperators
[08:37:54] <drej> and STILL USABLE
[08:37:56] <Jattenalle> oh my sweet merciful code
[08:37:58] <Jattenalle> that is AMAZING
[08:38:16] <Jattenalle> next-gen table based layout as well
[08:38:20] <drej> yup
[08:38:23] <drej> even had some DHTML in there
[08:38:27] <Jattenalle> and such amazing javascript
[08:38:30] <drej> oh wait that was down the road
[08:38:31] <Jattenalle> that trackMouseMove
[08:38:47] <Jattenalle> var monthOff = xOff % yearImgWidth;
[08:38:56] <drej> that's from archive.org
[08:38:57] <drej> not the site itself
[08:39:05] <Jattenalle> oh
[08:39:10] <Jattenalle> really? lol
[08:39:11] <BillCriswell> drej: This is your finest work.
[08:39:15] <Jattenalle> that's still quite ugly code though :P
[08:39:15] <drej> BillCriswell right ?
[08:39:19] <drej> it was all basically downhill from there
[08:39:30] <drej> 17 year down slope career
[08:39:33] <Jattenalle> ah, i see it, i missed the insert comment
[08:39:55] <Jattenalle> best viewed in IE
[08:40:02] <drej> and netscape THREE
[08:40:03] <drej> son
[08:40:23] <Jattenalle> aw, and a count.cgi
[08:40:43] <BillCriswell> The backwards compatibility browser developers need to support is unfair. I'd jump off a bridge probably.
[08:41:02] <drej> yeah :( we had this chat the other day
[08:41:05] <drej> if if wasnt for that we'd have
[08:41:05] <Jattenalle> wait, the maruqee... is a gif
[08:41:08] <drej> <element href="">
[08:41:17] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:41:33] <BillCriswell> At least we could put block level elements in <a> tags now. Good enough.
[08:41:51] <drej> yeah , although i always feel dirty doing it
[08:42:00] <drej> Jattenalle i have no idea how i would go about even creating that marquee as a gif any more
[08:42:16] <drej> does photoshop do animated gifs ?
[08:42:21] <Jattenalle> i have no idea
[08:42:22] <Jattenalle> maybe?
[08:42:25] <Jattenalle> probably?
[08:42:26] <Jattenalle> :P
[08:44:42] <jParkton> Photoshop does EVERYTHING!
[08:44:47] <jParkton> automagic
[08:47:53] <opie-wrk> is it possible to capture page load javascript errors in an iframe from parent
[08:48:26] <opie-wrk> as maybe a way for one page to load another page and make sure it's status 200 and no errors, just an idea i'm tossing around
[08:50:24] <jParkton> npm install http
[08:52:44] <duch_kazatel> goooood morning folks.
[08:53:03] <jParkton> good mornin
[08:53:08] <PerlWebDev> greetings and salutations, duch_kazatel
[08:53:15] <jParkton> lol
[08:53:22] <Jattenalle> morning duch_kazatel, we're discussing diadem cults and looking at sites drej made in 1997
[08:53:29] <duch_kazatel> sicktight.
[08:53:32] <jParkton> I had a friend who said salutations and hallucinations
[08:53:35] <drej> yeah lots of good times overall
[08:53:39] <jParkton> LOL
[08:53:54] <duch_kazatel> sheeeeit.
[08:54:17] <jParkton> im learning how to make generators?
[08:54:31] <jParkton> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*
[08:54:36] <jParkton> and Iterators
[08:54:40] <jParkton> fancy stuff
[08:54:50] <drej> oh yeah, basically its a party
[08:55:51] <jParkton> lol
[08:56:06] <duch_kazatel> i actually have a real question - anybody here know of a way to get a masonry-style layout, but without the library?
[08:56:12] <drej> me so hungy
[08:56:18] <jParkton> hire a mason
[08:56:21] <drej> duch_kazatel flexbox will probably get you pretty close
[08:56:28] <jParkton> oh drej im also a Shriner now
[08:56:38] <jParkton> so one cult to another I guess lol
[08:56:49] <drej> jParkton hey, whatever helps you pass the time? :)
[08:57:07] <duch_kazatel> drej i have to support all the way back to IE8
[08:57:17] <drej> duch_kazatel yeah then you're basically stuck with masonry
[08:57:22] <duch_kazatel> ffff. all right.
[08:57:23] <drej> you can look at isotope its a bit cleaner than masonry
[08:57:26] <drej> same author
[08:57:36] <drej> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[08:57:43] <drej> has more filtering and such options out of the box
[08:57:46] <duch_kazatel> this is for a small part of our product pages.
[08:58:04] <duch_kazatel> super small, simple thing, which is why i'm looking for something small.
[08:58:09] <jParkton> I just like helping others
[08:58:22] <jParkton> it gives me a way to do that
[08:58:41] <drej> duch_kazatel could you use flexbox and then have an alternate layout for older browsers
[08:58:45] <drej> maybe not so masonry-ish
[08:58:59] <duch_kazatel> i might be able to get away with that.  i'm just weighing options.
[09:09:56] <proteneer_osx> i'm new to jQuery, can someone explain to me why "inside get" is printed out only once inside this example? http://bpaste.net/show/EMfFEOuAUDviIQh4wtJZ/
[09:10:49] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx because there's only one target_id
[09:11:23] <duch_kazatel> also, why not just enumerate over the object you fetch, instead of pushing it into a new array?
[09:11:43] <proteneer_osx> wait i'm confused
[09:11:49] <proteneer_osx> doesn't the target_id get rebound?
[09:11:54] <jParkton> story of my life
[09:12:04] <duch_kazatel> also, you're not waiting for the requests to finish.  you're just firing them off.
[09:12:14] <duch_kazatel> target_ids, sorry
[09:12:16] <nezZario> How can I select the first span of a jquery obj ?
[09:12:37] <jParkton> guess it depends on the obj?
[09:12:49] <jParkton> Obj.keys
[09:12:57] <duch_kazatel> .find('span').eq(0
[09:12:57] <nezZario> well like $('foo').find('span') is that going to return an array if multiple spans ?
[09:13:06] <proteneer_osx> duch_kazatel: how do I wait for it to finish?
[09:13:10] <duch_kazatel> nezZario that'll return an array-like if there's one.
[09:13:22] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx create a queue and/or use deferreds.
[09:15:40] <proteneer_osx> ok i still don't understand why my $.get is fired off only once
[09:15:45] <proteneer_osx> if my target_ids has two elements
[09:15:53] <proteneer_osx> that for loop should iterate twice
[09:15:59] <proteneer_osx> and fire off two $.get
[09:16:12] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx look at your network tab - i'll bet you're firing two, but only one successfully completes.
[09:18:06] <proteneer_osx> they both returned 200 OK
[09:20:02] <duch_kazatel> screenshot of your console?
[09:20:45] <nezZario> ahhh nevermind
[09:20:52] <nezZario> i was just being a dummy
[09:21:01] <proteneer_osx> duch_kazatel: the output is in the comments
[09:21:04] <proteneer_osx> of the url i posted
[09:21:17] <nezZario> it was working with just .find() like I had expected, just an unrelated issue
[09:21:30] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx a screenshot would still be nice.
[09:21:46] <d0de> I'm trying to fix some probs on a friend's wordpress site. There's a version of jQuery included in the head, but whenever I try to use jQuery in scripts way down at the bottom of the body, I get 'undefined' errors. What gives?
[09:21:58] <proteneer_osx> duch_kazatel: it actually says (2) inside get c6bf09d3-4b24-424b-b550-5d08a526a0de
[09:22:02] <proteneer_osx> i'm not sure what that means
[09:22:10] <proteneer_osx> 2 of the same thing?
[09:22:14] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx :) that means it's the same output twice.
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> d0de does using jQuery work, but $ doesn't?
[09:22:35] <proteneer_osx> so why is the inner function using the same target_id?
[09:22:41] <proteneer_osx> even though the outer loop redefines it
[09:22:59] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I haven't tried using jQuery, I'll try that now
[09:22:59] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx i'd have to see your data.
[09:23:40] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx because it shouldn't be reusing the same ID - check your network tab again and look at the data.
[09:24:21] <proteneer_osx> yes i can see it making a request to a different /stats/:target_id
[09:24:39] <proteneer_osx> but the target_id inside console.log() is always the same
[09:25:11] <proteneer_osx> this must be some weird scoping thing
[09:25:14] <d0de> duch_kazatel, using jQuery works fine! Why would that work and $ not work?
[09:25:25] <duch_kazatel> d0de noConflcit mode is turned on.
[09:25:50] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx shouldn't be - try using target_ids[i]; instead of target_id in that second get.
[09:26:04] <proteneer_osx> duch_kazatel: already did, then it shows up as undefined
[09:26:18] <CrowX-> if I want to make a game with a theme of some book, I have to ask for permission from the book's author, right?
[09:26:25] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- generally.
[09:26:34] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, even if the game is non profit?
[09:26:35] <d0de> duch_kazatel, super helpful, thanks!
[09:26:36] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx then you've got something else going on, because the scope should be fine.
[09:26:38] <duch_kazatel> d0de of course.
[09:27:38] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- it depends.
[09:27:45] <CrowX-> on what
[09:27:48] <duch_kazatel> the author.
[09:27:56] <duch_kazatel> or rights holder.
[09:28:01] <duch_kazatel> what book is it?
[09:28:43] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those things about derivative works and all that.
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx how familiar are you with how scoping works?
[09:29:16] <proteneer_osx> only from python/C
[09:29:34] <duch_kazatel> aaah that explains it - those vars in that for loop aren't scoped there.
[09:29:56] <proteneer_osx> yeah i'm trying to figure out why all of the variables become undefined inside the GET
[09:30:00] <proteneer_osx> the $.get *
[09:30:02] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what's happening to your code.
[09:30:07] <duch_kazatel> but they shouldn't be undefined there
[09:30:20] <proteneer_osx> well some of them are undefined*
[09:30:25] <duch_kazatel> they shouldn't be.
[09:30:43] <duch_kazatel> variables are function scoped, and anything defined in a parent scope exists in a child scope.
[09:31:08] <jParkton> I get that
[09:31:12] <jParkton> :O
[09:31:57] <proteneer_osx> oh so basically i finish going through the for loop
[09:32:03] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx http://bpaste.net/show/OGohDyc1sj5dhl22HnIS/
[09:32:04] <proteneer_osx> before I finish the get requests
[09:32:08] <GerAlex> hi :)
[09:32:25] <proteneer_osx> oh
[09:32:35] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx this is what the parser is doing to your code.  that should be fine though.
[09:32:54] <GerAlex> I have a question .... How can I get the contents of a file (test.txt -> "1" or "0") to assign to a variable??
[09:32:54] <duch_kazatel> you also had an extra }) at the end.
[09:33:10] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex using AJAX.
[09:33:33] <duch_kazatel> proteneer_osx also, $.get() is async, so it fires off the request and the code keeps trucking along.
[09:33:35] <proteneer_osx> yeah
[09:33:40] <proteneer_osx> that's the real problem
[09:33:46] <proteneer_osx> my loop finished before my async calls finished
[09:33:50] <proteneer_osx> which overwrote all the target_ids
[09:33:51] <proteneer_osx> etc.
[09:33:57] <proteneer_osx> thanks i'll fix later at work
[09:33:57] <duch_kazatel> prolly.
[09:34:01] <jParkton> what is ->?
[09:34:03] <duch_kazatel> check out deferreds.
[09:34:04] <GerAlex> i use Ajax... but I do not know the command
[09:34:15] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex show us what you have so far in a fiddle.
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ GerAlex
[09:38:17] <b-ot> GerAlex: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:38:22] <duch_kazatel> don't PM me your stuff please.
[09:38:47] <duch_kazatel> just paste your code in one of these services and share with the room.
[09:41:05] <GerAlex> ok..mom
[09:41:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:42:17] <GerAlex> sry .. am a little slow. I the first time here
[09:42:38] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.  that's why I'm showing you how to get help :)
[09:52:42] <GerAlex> http://fixee.org/paste/425oe5i/
[09:53:01] <GerAlex> I found this code on the internet. I wanted to try to rewrite this code so that I can save the contents of a file into a variable.
[09:53:01] <GerAlex> I cant make it
[09:53:19] <EminenceHC> Will someone please help me understand this? I am using JS to watch a select box, and on .change() event, fire an ajax call to a custom method in my controller. How can I get the response from the controller? Here is my code: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/49ed131dd5667a4d1651
[09:53:47] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex okay - and is data.txt available via your webserver?
[09:55:16] <GerAlex> yes
[09:55:34] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex so it's available at domain/data.txt?
[09:55:35] <GerAlex> The content should not be spent on the website, rather stored in a variable
[09:56:00] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex to access it via ajax you must serve the file up via a server.
[09:57:04] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex is your console giving you any errors?
[09:59:24] <GerAlex> the Internet code and Ajay commands work, no erros...
[09:59:24] <GerAlex> All I know is not the method of how it stores it in a variable
[09:59:37] <GerAlex> errors
[10:00:06] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex try console.log(msg) - what does that give you?
[10:00:42] <GerAlex> ok mom :)
[10:00:49] <duch_kazatel> or not.
[10:00:53] <duch_kazatel> aaaand blocking.
[10:03:21] <qiau> can I modify appended divs directly after creating them dynmically? or do I have to wait for them to render?.. <- newbee
[10:03:42] <duch_kazatel> qiau you can modify them right after - no need to wait.,
[10:04:16] <qiau> thank you
[10:05:05] <aro> if i have jquery 1.9 loaded
[10:05:12] <aro> and i load 1.7 with $.getScript()
[10:05:18] <aro> will it override the 1.9 one?
[10:05:20] <duch_kazatel> aro don't do that ....
[10:06:12] <duch_kazatel> aro why are you loading 1.7 in like that in the first place?
[10:06:22] <aro> its just an example
[10:06:29] <aro> we are trying to load an older version of bootstrap
[10:06:37] <aro> after the first version is loaded
[10:06:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's a bad idea.
[10:06:45] <aro> because we need both versions for one page
[10:06:49] <aro> what can i do?
[10:06:54] <duch_kazatel> only use one version.
[10:06:59] <duch_kazatel> and update all your code.
[10:07:00] <aro> thats not an option for this page
[10:07:20] <aro> we *need* to use 2.3.2 for a certain plugin we are using
[10:07:22] <duch_kazatel> and per http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ - "The script is executed in the global context, so it can refer to other variables and use jQuery functions. Included scripts can have some impact on the current page."
[10:07:24] <aro> we just need it for that one
[10:07:30] <duch_kazatel> then you need to remove that requirement.
[10:07:34] <aro> we cannot
[10:07:53] <aro> I need something like a noconflict mode or something
[10:08:12] <duch_kazatel> then look into something like require.js - iirc that'll let you scope things.
[10:08:19] <aro> come again?
[10:08:48] <duch_kazatel> trust me - i just got through the pain of upgrading part of our codebase from jq 1.8.3 to 1.11, and i'm current abating mootools.
[10:09:27] <duch_kazatel> *abating mootools out of another part.  it's worth the time investment.  you'll spend more time trying to get two versions of bootstrap to coexist well than changing stuff so you only need one
[10:10:04] <Fraz> hi
[10:10:23] <GerAlex> @duch_kazetel <---  so .. I tried .... but nothing has changed. Where should I write in? the same output
[10:10:46] <Fraz> if i have an array of objects with a property of 'time', how would i go about sorting the array by this property?
[10:11:34] <duch_kazatel> aro but there are some libraries out there that will let you load things and "namespace" them.  you'll have to update the rest of your code to play well though.
[10:12:08] <duch_kazatel> Fraz array.sort()
[10:12:19] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn array.prototype.sort
[10:12:20] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Array.prototype.sort() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[10:14:47] <Fraz> ahh thanks
[10:14:55] <Fraz> didnt realise you could use array_sort like that
[10:15:06] <duch_kazatel> lots of people don'e :)
[10:15:08] <duch_kazatel> *don't
[10:16:39] <jParkton> when I log an obj to the console I get [object Object] {stuff} what is object Object?
[10:16:50] <jParkton> window Myobj?
[10:16:57] <jParkton> or watt?
[10:17:00] <duch_kazatel> jParkton are you trying to log the object as a string?
[10:17:43] <systemfault> jParkton: Using a shitty browser like Firefox?
[10:17:53] <duch_kazatel> systemfault i use firefox and don't get that result ;)
[10:17:58] <systemfault> jParkton: If so, use console.dir(object) instead.
[10:18:09] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: You use Firebug? :P
[10:18:11] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:18:12] <naeluh> howdy partners :-)
[10:18:14] <duch_kazatel> i do indeed.
[10:18:28] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Heh… Firebug is better than the built-in dev tools.
[10:18:39] <systemfault> (Which is a total shame at this point)
[10:18:48] <duch_kazatel> the built-in tools' console works much better than it used to.
[10:18:57] <duch_kazatel> and it can log objects just fine, too.
[10:19:27] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Yeah… but not with console.log… because F**K unwritten standards, right.
[10:19:40] <duch_kazatel> since when hasn't that worked?
[10:19:59] <systemfault> I don’t know.. Stopped using Firefox on a daily basis 5 years ago.
[10:20:03] <jParkton> systemfault: Chrome
[10:20:34] <systemfault> jParkton: Chrome should have printed the actual object.. and you should be able to navigate through its properties.
[10:20:49] <systemfault> jParkton: By clicking on the small triangle next to the object
[10:20:52] <jParkton> ah tru
[10:20:58] <jParkton> I was on jsbin
[10:21:13] <systemfault> Use a real console… not the JSBin stuff.
[10:21:23] <jParkton> I should
[10:21:25] <duch_kazatel> jsbin's console is awful.
[10:21:36] <jParkton> ok answer dis
[10:21:57] <jParkton> If I have a js file with some functions in it how do I run that in console?
[10:22:02] <jParkton> just sources?
[10:22:56] <qiau> so.. how come this isnt working as I expect? http://jsfiddle.net/bB26g/ Isn
[10:22:58] <duch_kazatel> systemfault http://i.imgur.com/Lyx1Ovs.png :)
[10:23:12] <qiau> Isn't it possible to use vars like that in jquery/js?
[10:23:16] <duch_kazatel> qiau don't use .bing.  use
[10:23:23] <duch_kazatel> *.bind() use .on()
[10:23:28] <jParkton> how?
[10:23:44] <jParkton> just run in this? data:text/html ,<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:23:44] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Nice
[10:23:44] <duch_kazatel> jParkton not following - what are you trying to do?
[10:23:52] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Must be recent
[10:24:09] <jParkton> duch_kazatel: just to run a file I make in $editor
[10:24:11] <qiau> duch_kazatel: why? (stil not working) :)
[10:24:12] <duch_kazatel> systemfault it's been like that for a while.
[10:24:20] <duch_kazatel> qiau let me poke.
[10:24:24] <jParkton> without needing markup
[10:25:04] <duch_kazatel> jParkton you can run arbitrary code through the console, or use the debugger.
[10:25:53] <jParkton> its hard for me to make functions and stuff in console
[10:26:13] <qiau> duch_kazatel: it works when Im not using a variable.. just static text.. but this is a part of a bigger script where I generate colapsable div's on the fly that I want to bind 'expand' to fetch data to..
[10:26:20] <duch_kazatel> why?  copy/paste or multiline editing jParkton
[10:26:26] <jParkton> does brackets have a console thing?
[10:26:28] <duch_kazatel> qiau slow down - give me a sec.
[10:26:54] <qiau> no worries, I'm in no hurry :)
[10:27:13] <jParkton> just like https://gist.github.com/jparkton/3689045d1d8b4203e382
[10:27:14] <duch_kazatel> oh derp.
[10:27:23] <jParkton> I cant keep up doing it all in console
[10:27:29] <duch_kazatel> qiau div id="#i' + aNumber is your problem.
[10:27:34] <duch_kazatel> the id should just be the value ;)
[10:27:44] <duch_kazatel> no pound symbol.
[10:28:00] <duch_kazatel> jParkton firebug has a multiline editor.
[10:28:10] <duch_kazatel> and you can do that in chrome's dev tools, too.
[10:28:13] <duch_kazatel> lots of options.
[10:28:19] <duch_kazatel> qiau http://jsfiddle.net/bB26g/2/
[10:29:43] <duch_kazatel> wasn't a js problem - it was an HTML problem.
[10:30:31] <MikeD_> good catch, fwiw
[10:31:03] <duch_kazatel> hah
[10:31:18] <duch_kazatel> took me a sec and then I had that "hurr hurr" moment.
[10:33:29] <decalmo> I'm a total total n00b when it comes to jQuery, and I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me figure out why this isn't working :(
[10:33:29] <decalmo> http://pastebucket.com/40903
[10:33:47] <decalmo> I just want to grab specific fields from a certain form and sum them anytime they're updated.
[10:34:19] <duch_kazatel> decalmo can you setup a jsfiddle with your version of jquery and your html?
[10:34:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/E3P9Q/ started this one here for you.
[10:35:59] <Forbidd3n> how to you get bootstrap nav menu items to drop to target in page?
[10:36:08] <Forbidd3n> wrong chan sorry
[10:36:10] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:37:27] <decalmo> duch_kazatel thx thx
[10:37:27] <decalmo> http://jsfiddle.net/E3P9Q/1/
[10:37:42] <duch_kazatel> decalmo what version of js are you using?
[10:37:46] <duch_kazatel> err, jquery
[10:37:47] <decalmo> oh whups 1 sec
[10:38:12] <decalmo> http://jsfiddle.net/E3P9Q/2/
[10:38:30] <duch_kazatel> there's your first problem :)
[10:38:44] <decalmo> oh no!
[10:38:52] <duch_kazatel> .live() was removed from jquery 10.1
[10:38:55] <duch_kazatel> err, 1.10.1
[10:38:59] <decalmo> ahhhhh shite shite
[10:39:23] <duch_kazatel> err, 1.8 actually.
[10:40:54] <decalmo> simple as changing it to .on?
[10:40:57] <decalmo> seems to do the trick
[10:41:01] <duch_kazatel> should be.
[10:41:04] <decalmo> awesome awesome
[10:41:08] <decalmo> thanks so much duch_kazatel!
[10:41:30] <duch_kazatel> you should brush up on the differences between the two btw.
[10:42:31] <drej> is it weird that i get excited when i get to do extremely complex responsive UI shit
[10:42:36] <drej> with media query magic
[10:47:22] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[10:47:26] <duch_kazatel> just make sure it's not too complex
[10:47:41] <drej> its not complex to the end user of course :)
[10:47:54] <drej> its complex to achieve with no javascript though
[10:47:59] <drej> (some of the nuances)
[10:51:14] <decalmo> duch_kazatel, do you know why the result won't add decimal values to the output?
[10:51:35] <duch_kazatel> parseInt()
[10:52:33] <duch_kazatel> you want parseFloat()
[10:52:38] <decalmo> ahhhh me <3 u
[10:54:02] <GerAlex> @duch_kazatel <---
[10:54:02] <GerAlex> I look in my console and I find the same text that appears in my *. txt_Datei. Is that good? Can I assign it to a variable?
[10:54:29] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex i have no idea what you're talking about, and you were kind of an asshole earlier.
[10:55:41] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex are you saying you did the console.log() i suggested?
[10:55:42] <GerAlex> ??
[10:55:49] <duch_kazatel> calling me "mom"?
[10:56:03] <duch_kazatel> that was pretty rude.
[10:56:33] <GerAlex> mom = moment = just a moment
[10:56:43] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaah. okay.
[10:56:46] <GerAlex> xD
[10:56:50] <duch_kazatel> then i apologize.
[10:56:50] <GerAlex> :))
[10:56:56] <duch_kazatel> no way for me to know that.
[10:57:04] <GerAlex> no problem :)
[10:57:05] <duch_kazatel> so did you do the console.log() i suggested?
[10:59:00] <GerAlex> yes
[10:59:10] <duch_kazatel> what do you get back?
[11:00:25] <GerAlex> the Same content as in my txt file    --> TXT-File = "1010" ---> Console = "1010"
[11:00:36] <duch_kazatel> so the result is just 1010?
[11:01:04] <duch_kazatel> if so, you can store that value just fine.
[11:01:40] <GerAlex> moment I look again
[11:03:28] <GerAlex> how can I do this?
[11:03:37] <duch_kazatel> do what?  store the var?
[11:03:58] <duch_kazatel> by setting a variable to that value.  are you trying to use that value somewhere else?
[11:06:42] <GerAlex> yes, trying to use did value somewhere. I want this value in an if - query
[11:13:59] <duch_kazatel> use the .done() callback instead.
[11:14:20] <duch_kazatel> or update the fiddle.
[11:19:15] <MikeD_> if I delegate events from a parent to some children, how can i triggerHandler on the parent if the function is assuming a scope where "this" refers to one of the children?
[11:19:25] <duch_kazatel> trigger on the child.
[11:20:26] <MikeD_> so what is the purpose of triggerHandler if it doesn't bubble?
[11:20:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:20:51] <MikeD_> .triggerHandler is a method.. that doesn't bubble
[11:21:06] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/triggerhandler/
[11:21:19] <duch_kazatel> the docs explain it pretty well.
[11:22:19] <MikeD_> right, which is why I was using triggerHandler before you told me to use trigger
[11:23:06] <MikeD_> i refactored some code and broke it, was trying to figure out how to pass a child to the function programmatically
[11:23:19] <MikeD_> but, idc - it works with child.trigger
[11:23:59] <duch_kazatel> the difference is one basically just runs a function attached to a node.  the other synthetically fires the event.
[11:24:03] <BillCriswell> DRUPAL RAGGEEEE
[11:24:04] <duch_kazatel> two different concepts imo.
[11:24:13] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you mean Drupal?
[11:24:13] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:24:34] <MikeD_> would you rather Wordpress ?
[11:24:36] <BillCriswell> CAPITAL DRUPAL
[11:24:45] <duch_kazatel> i'd rather not PHP in general.
[11:25:15] <drej> but php is so much fun!
[11:25:23] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: At least the admin for Wordpress is kind of friendly. I can't find anything I like about Drupal besides that I make money building things with it.
[11:25:44] <drej> working with php is like trying to explain to your alcoholic uncle why it's a bad idea to piss on the bushes at a family gathering
[11:26:10] <BillCriswell> drej: Is that an analogy?
[11:26:29] <drej> haha yes
[11:26:33] <drej> as opposed to sadness? yes
[11:27:42] <decx> that analogy was worse than trying to explain to your alcoholic uncle why it's a bad idea to piss on the bushes at a family gathering
[11:28:44] <MikeD_> was that a simile?
[11:29:27] <BillCriswell> decx: That one I got! Haha
[11:29:32] <BillCriswell> drej: Total sadness.
[11:30:43] <drej> lol decalmo
[11:30:46] <drej> err decx
[11:34:08] <jParkton> drej
[11:34:15] <drej> yo
[11:34:27] <jParkton> once I have jquery loaded how can I call an obj in my console?
[11:34:40] <jParkton> umm like
[11:34:43] <drej> the same way you would normally ?
[11:34:49] <drej> wahtever yo uhave in your js, you can just do in the console
[11:35:04] <jParkton> ok like this
[11:35:06] <jParkton> one sec
[11:38:14] <decalmo> duch_kazatel: hey if I wanted to format the output from http://jsfiddle.net/E3P9Q/4/ to 2 decimal places... i'm having trouble making that happen :(
[11:38:48] <duch_kazatel> decalmo did you try asking google first?
[11:38:55] <decalmo> yes... yes I did
[11:38:59] <decalmo> i've tried many combinations
[11:39:06] <duch_kazatel> !g javascript format number to 2 decimals
[11:39:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: javascript - Format number to always show 2 decimal places - Stack ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6134039/format-number-to-always-show-2-decimal-places

[11:39:42] <jParkton> https://i.imgur.com/LisFT25.png I mean
[11:39:50] <jParkton> or am I doing it wrong?
[11:39:58] <duch_kazatel> jParkton cats only exists inside that function.
[11:40:07] <duch_kazatel> that's javascript scope.
[11:40:10] <GerAlex> @ duch_kazatel <- It works!! I would like to thank you so much for your quick and competent help. I am so happy :))
[11:40:12] <jParkton> yeah
[11:40:17] <duch_kazatel> GerAlex deffo.
[11:40:19] <jParkton> im failing the scope challange
[11:40:21] <jParkton> lol
[11:40:25] <duch_kazatel> sorry for the misundrstanding earlier!
[11:40:26] <decx> you know cats dont abide by the rules of scoping
[11:40:38] <GerAlex> no problem :))
[11:40:42] <GerAlex> THX!
[11:41:05] <jParkton> but it should be loaded when document is ready?
[11:41:13] <jParkton> or am I not understanding it right
[11:41:20] <decalmo> duch_kazatel: gaahhhh got it... had to do sum = then teh function
[11:41:21] <duch_kazatel> that's not scoping ;)
[11:42:35] <jParkton> hmm
[11:42:42] <duch_kazatel> one sec i'll show you.
[11:42:58] <jParkton> I would need to pass the obj in the function itself?
[11:43:08] <duch_kazatel> slow down.
[11:43:25] <jParkton> ok
[11:43:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h58cv/
[11:43:32] <duch_kazatel> check that out.
[11:44:20] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to call a variable outside of that variable's scope.
[11:45:17] <jParkton> but it says numberOne is undefined too
[11:45:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:45:26] <jParkton> shouldnt that be in scope?
[11:45:32] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h58cv/2/
[11:45:36] <duch_kazatel> in a more direct example.
[11:45:45] <duch_kazatel> numberOne() is an object.
[11:45:47] <duch_kazatel> just like any other.
[11:45:56] <jParkton> yes
[11:46:19] <duch_kazatel> look at my second example for a more direct comparison.
[11:46:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h58cv/3/
[11:46:57] <duch_kazatel> or this.
[11:47:47] <anderskristo> ye
[11:50:30] <duch_kazatel> jParkton this making some more sense?
[11:52:09] <jParkton> yes
[11:52:16] <jParkton> I need to read more on scopes
[11:52:18] <jParkton> lol
[11:52:27] <duch_kazatel> jParkton it's pretty simple.
[11:52:36] <jParkton> yeah
[11:52:40] <duch_kazatel> a variable declared in a function exists only in that function.
[11:52:41] <jParkton> im just slow at times
[11:52:46] <duch_kazatel> including child functions.
[11:52:48] <jParkton> yes
[11:53:05] <jParkton> but how to call that method successfully is my issue
[11:53:07] <jParkton> lol
[11:53:25] <duch_kazatel> by not using a document ready.
[11:53:37] <duch_kazatel> or declaring the function outside of the doc ready and calling it within it.
[11:53:54] <duch_kazatel> or by rethinking the problem - why do you want to call that function directly?
[11:57:22] <qiau> duch_kazatel: so.. here is the REAL problem, how come my event isn't bound to the right div here? http://jsfiddle.net/2Fc4W/ .. when I change to on('click') I expect it to log on expand but it logs first on the contained data?!
[11:58:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:58:18] <qiau> nevermind.. bound it to h1 instead.. still dont understand but now it works <tm>
[11:58:34] <duch_kazatel> i think you need to read about events and binding.
[11:58:41] <qiau> yeah
[11:58:50] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[11:58:51] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:00:32] <jParkton> dutch I just want to make some function like power(a,b) and be able to pass power(2,3) in console like I can on jsbin
[12:00:42] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[12:00:50] <jParkton> lol
[12:00:51] <jParkton> oops
[12:00:58] * jParkton is blind
[12:01:05] <duch_kazatel> and fine - declare it outside of the document ready and then call it there.
[12:01:14] <jParkton> ok thats what I thought
[12:01:28] <duch_kazatel> though your should probably learn to use breakpoints and stuff instead.
[12:02:07] <jParkton> breakpoints?
[12:02:24] <jParkton> man I cant even right a good Obj yet lol
[12:02:25] <duch_kazatel> :) why are you trying to call functions manually like that?
[12:02:46] <jParkton> just so I can code it in my ide and call it in dev tools console
[12:02:51] <jParkton> easier for me to see
[12:02:58] <duch_kazatel> this is why tools like jSfiddle existr.
[12:03:00] <duch_kazatel> *exist
[12:03:04] <jParkton> yeah
[12:03:06] <duch_kazatel> as well as the console in your browser.
[12:03:11] <duch_kazatel> do things in there instead.
[12:03:13] <jParkton> I usually do it in jsbin
[12:03:32] <jParkton> jsfiddle is hard on my eyes
[12:03:44] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[12:03:59] <duch_kazatel> bbiab grabbing lunch.
[12:04:14] <jParkton> but I think im gonna write a simple node server and then call it from console?
[12:04:23] <duch_lunch> wat
[12:04:25] <jParkton> browserify
[12:04:27] <duch_lunch> that's not how node works.
[12:04:35] <jParkton> ye
[12:04:49] <duch_lunch> are you just trying to learn javascript?
[12:04:50] <jParkton> I made a simple server though
[12:04:52] <jParkton> jes
[12:05:01] <duch_lunch> that explains a lot.
[12:05:06] <jParkton> :(
[12:05:11] <duch_lunch> lol not in a bad way.
[12:05:14] <jParkton> im nubly
[12:05:25] <duch_lunch> node also has a command line REPL available.
[12:05:26] <jParkton> im making progress though lol
[12:05:32] <jParkton> that is true
[12:05:37] <duch_lunch> lots of options.
[12:05:39] <jParkton> but I use codeivate
[12:05:45] <jParkton> lol
[12:05:59] <duch_lunch> bbiab.

[12:06:29] <GnuBoi> I'm using jquery data table I'm having very simple issue of not being able to make some text bold in information displayed by datatable. https://susu.me/owncloud/public.php?service=files&t=781f73fcbc61422834987cca3d19251f
[12:09:08] <BillCriswell> GnuBoi: Actual demo would help.
[12:09:33] <BillCriswell> Are you trying to bold the whole cell? If so is your CSS not specific enough?
[12:09:33] <GnuBoi> https://datatables.net/release-datatables/extensions/FixedColumns/examples/two_columns.html
[12:09:52] <GnuBoi> BillCriswell:Only bold the numbers in the text "Showing 1 to 57 of 57 entries
[12:09:52] <GnuBoi> "
[12:11:30] <BillCriswell> GnuBoi: http://legacy.datatables.net/usage/i18n#oLanguage.sInfo click "Show Details" =)
[12:13:22] <GnuBoi> BillCriswell: Cool, I'm looking into it. I'll update you.
[12:14:09] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[12:18:13] <GnuBoi> BillCriswell:Sweet, you are extremely knowledge. Thank you very much. Keep rocking bro.
[12:18:36] <BillCriswell> GnuBoi: Google did all the work.
[12:18:51] <BillCriswell> 'datatables changing "showing" text' was the exact query haha
[12:19:27] <BillCriswell> I will continue to rock, though!
[12:20:51] <GnuBoi> BillCriswell:I need to brush up my google fu.
[12:20:54] <GnuBoi> Damn
[12:21:01] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to create a tab-based menu system and I'm running into a margin issue whenever new LIs are added. I've created a fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/2z2Z4/
[12:21:02] <Wolf_22> Proper height aside (I plan on tackling that later) what I'm mostly concerned about here is that the margins of the new LIs (tabs) are not the same as those already added. I was hoping someone could help me understand why.
[12:28:01] <antlong_> i need to force users to click a modal in a button before they can interact with the site, whats the best way to do that?
[12:52:37] <mrhanky> he folks
[12:53:05] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ use a transparent overlay div and only hide it and the modal when they click the button
[12:53:42] <antlong_> duch_kazatel alright, thanks
[12:54:52] <mrhanky> is it possible to use toggle('slide') on a google map? so the map resizes on every animation step
[12:55:18] <duch_kazatel> mrhanky not following.  have you tried?
[12:56:01] <mrhanky> yes, i tried triggering the gmaps resize event, but the map only gehts redrawn if the toggle is finished
[12:56:24] <duch_kazatel> can you show us what you're trying to do?
[12:58:07] <mrhanky> not sure how to how. i have a google map and a sidebar, sidebar left, map right with a button to toggle('slide') the sidebar. while the sidebar reduces it's width the google map should get redrawn oh every step
[12:58:39] <duch_kazatel> can you share the site you're working on?
[12:58:51] <mrhanky> but the sec
[12:59:19] <duch_kazatel> it's hard to understand what the question actially is, that's why an example would be killer.
[13:08:52] <thebope> I feel kinda bad for the Brazilians. It feels like the poorest peoples who actually live there are just getting shat upon in order that a bunch of rich fucks from other countries can come trample over their country and a bunch of other rich fucks can watch from far away
[13:09:09] <thebope> Sorry
[13:09:12] <thebope> thats my new class name
[13:09:19] <thebope> I was wonderting how to write a selector for it
[13:09:20] <thebope> >.>
[13:09:21] <thebope> <.<
[13:09:23] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[13:09:42] <thebope> lol
[13:12:33] <nezZario> um
[13:12:44] <nezZario> how can I tell if .find() finds something or not?
[13:13:00] <duch_kazatel> .length
[13:15:24] <thebope> dang, thats like, the question I'm best at answer
[13:15:31] <thebope> answering. I'm going to have to step my game up
[13:15:42] <jfranks> Having a brain fart.. jQuery("a.fc-event.fc-event-hori").css( "border", "3px solid red" ); will iterate over the matching elements and put a border on them. Cool. I want to check each element's CSS for width less than 100px and only apply it to those.
[13:16:24] <duch_kazatel> jfranks might need to .each() on that and check their .width().
[13:16:31] <duch_kazatel> but that'll only be rendered width.
[13:16:40] <duch_kazatel> .css('width') is closer to what you're asking for.
[13:16:53] <thebope> yea thats what I was thinking
[13:17:24] <duch_kazatel> or use .filter()
[13:17:46] <thebope> filters really cool I should use that more
[13:18:01] <duch_kazatel> i forget about it all the time.
[13:18:03] <duch_kazatel> it's a handy one.
[13:18:06] <jfranks> Hmmm Filter! Do da duch.. ;)
[13:18:14] <thebope> lol
[13:18:15] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:18:22] <thebope> It sounds like a jingle
[13:18:42] <jfranks> Yeah.. Now I can't remember where from? .. De Dutch Pankook House!
[13:19:32] <thebope> oh god pankook sounds like a crazy guy banging pans
[13:20:11] <jfranks> Ahh "Pannekoek"
[13:20:42] <jfranks> So Dutch.. it should be said only while wearing wooden shoes.
[13:20:49] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[13:20:53] <duch_kazatel> oh hahahaha
[13:20:58] <duch_kazatel> derp derp derp
[13:21:34] <mrhanky> duch_kazatel, so, ready now
[13:21:39] <drej> hagaha duch
[13:21:55] <mrhanky> http://unterschicht.tv:8000/ <- klick on the icon in the upper left
[13:22:03] <drej> why dont you make me
[13:22:24] <duch_kazatel> mrhanky you mean you want a smooth effect instead?
[13:22:30] <mrhanky> yes
[13:22:42] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[13:22:50] <mrhanky> but i tried everything i found on that topic, but none of them did the trick
[13:23:17] <duch_kazatel> okay first thing, all your inline JS needs to be in a separate file.
[13:23:44] <mrhanky> it's easier for me to work in one file while developing ;)
[13:23:59] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[13:24:01] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[13:24:05] <mrhanky> :P
[13:24:06] <duch_kazatel> where can i see your code?
[13:24:16] <duch_kazatel> for the slide effect click and all that?
[13:24:41] <drej> mrhanky http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/SlidePushMenus/
[13:24:43] <mrhanky> line 252, icon.click()
[13:25:22] <duch_kazatel> lines 242 through 248 should probably be scoped.  slap var in front of them ;)
[13:27:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah use what drej linked.
[13:28:19] <duch_kazatel> without ripping your stuff apart more it's hard to see how to fix your particular problem.
[13:28:39] <mrhanky> haha, pls dont judge the code :D
[13:28:45] <mrhanky> i'm a totally js beginner
[13:28:57] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[13:29:30] <duch_kazatel> part of my day job is to do code review, and sometimes bugs crop up because of weird mistakes.
[13:34:42] <jfranks> This example is working a little better than my live page ( Console: TypeError: undefined is not a function  ) http://jsbin.com/cevidebo/1/edit?html,js,output but the "if" part still does not work
[13:35:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/cevidebo/3/edit
[13:35:57] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[13:36:15] <duch_kazatel> do you want the actual width of the element though?
[13:36:21] <duch_kazatel> or the css-specified with?
[13:36:23] <duch_kazatel> *width
[13:36:39] <jfranks> css-specified
[13:36:44] <duch_kazatel> then yeah.
[13:36:51] <duch_kazatel> look at your console with the change i made.
[13:37:19] <jfranks> ahhh... "px"
[13:37:27] <jfranks> intval?
[13:37:31] <duch_kazatel> wut
[13:38:08] <jfranks> Well "109px" cannot evaluate against "200" .. it's a string. ;)
[13:38:12] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:38:16] <duch_kazatel> what is "intval"
[13:38:57] <Tomashe> Hey guys, something weird hapening to me . sometimes when i store OBJECT on localstorage and console.log it i just get [object , object] without the ability to see its content. actually im not sure it has content
[13:38:59] <jfranks> Oh PHP.. I'd just "intval($(this).ccs('width'));" to return the integers only
[13:39:22] <duch_kazatel> jfranks aaaaah. parseInt() after .replace('px', '');
[13:39:25] <sacho> Tomashe, you cannot store objects in localStorage - it's a key->string value storage.
[13:40:12] <Tomashe> weird, looks like its working some times
[13:40:20] <sacho> >> ({}).toString() @ Tomashe
[13:40:26] <sacho> hmm
[13:40:26] <Tomashe> so basicly i have to stringify it all the time..
[13:40:27] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:40:43] <jfranks> Ahhh it's smart in chrome.. :P Bet it'll NaN in FireFox.. ;p
[13:40:48] <sacho> js> true
[13:40:52] <duch_kazatel> jfranks nope.
[13:40:52] <b-ot> sacho: No output.
[13:41:06] <sacho> oh, right.
[13:41:20] <jfranks> duch: I got it without parsInt() in chrome. *But I'm trying in FF
[13:41:24] <sacho> Tomashe, yes, you need to stringify any objects you want to store, and then parse them later on.
[13:41:31] <Tomashe> i actually have json. but using JSON.stringify just eacing my resources :/
[13:41:50] <duch_kazatel> jfranks make sure you supply a radix to parseInt btw
[13:42:27] <duch_kazatel> and remove the 'px' part of the string before putting through.
[13:42:49] <Tomashe> any less eating resources way?
[13:42:54] <jfranks> duch_kazatel: Hmmm we're getting the real width not the CSS width aren't we?
[13:43:36] <duch_kazatel> jfranks ?  link to the bin again?
[13:45:21] <jfranks> http://jsbin.com/cevidebo/4/edit?html,js,output
[13:45:46] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i can't wait until i get my new headphones
[13:46:47] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha yep.  do you see what the problem is in this case?
[13:47:30] <duch_kazatel> jfranks you can't apply a width to inline elements - mind explaining what you're trying to do?
[13:47:31] <jfranks> <a> elms are only as wide as the content
[13:47:34] <GnuBoi> I'm using datatables and I'm having issue with IE8 and IE9. The thead tag uses does not display correctly? Is there any known workaround for datatable for IE8 and IE9?
[13:48:34] <duch_kazatel> i really wish datatables would get their own channel
[13:48:35] <jfranks> I am adding an option to remove the background for calendar events that are only 1 day.. or have a "width: 110px" in the CSS
[13:48:47] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel:agreed
[13:48:48] <duch_kazatel> jfranks that's a really bad way to do that.
[13:48:52] <jfranks> Yes!
[13:48:59] <duch_kazatel> jfranks you don't rely on the width.  add data.
[13:49:02] <jfranks> Not allowed to touch the stupid WP plugin..
[13:49:10] <jfranks> As soon as it updates.. Waaa
[13:49:29] <duch_kazatel> are these anchors display: block; in the plugin at least?
[13:50:07] <duch_kazatel> because display: block; elements can specify their own width.
[13:50:20] <duch_kazatel> another idea would be to parse the style attr for the width value.
[13:50:51] <jParkton> duch https://gist.github.com/jparkton/006b31421adf2cca0421
[13:50:57] <jParkton> am I doing this right?
[13:51:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:51:55] <jParkton> sad
[13:52:19] <jParkton> it does give me tru / false on a couple of tests lol
[13:52:25] <jParkton> so i am close?
[13:52:33] <jfranks> duch_jazatel: http://jsbin.com/cevidebo/4/edit  Has two examples from the page.. and lo.. it worked..
[13:53:10] <duch_kazatel> jParkton what happens when the second arg is longer than 5 chars?
[13:53:32] <jParkton> should I make the indexs smaller?
[13:53:36] <jParkton> 0,2?
[13:53:41] <duch_kazatel> don't use .slice()
[13:53:54] <jParkton> ok
[13:54:04] <jParkton> charAt?
[13:54:16] <duch_kazatel> there's a stupid simple way to do this.
[13:54:18] <jParkton> or is that the wrong comparing
[13:55:09] <jfranks> duch_kazatel: Yeah that's working great on jsbin.. Exactly what I needed.. BUT testing that in the console on chrome I get the usual : TypeError: undefined is not a function
[13:55:21] <duch_kazatel> jfranks that shouldn't be "the usual"
[13:55:28] <duch_kazatel> what specifically is undefined?
[13:55:34] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to dump through that error.
[13:55:39] <jParkton> duch str1.indexOf(str2) === 0
[13:55:46] <jParkton> ?
[13:55:54] <jfranks> It is when I test in the console. Usually it's $() vs. jQuery() ... usually (Wordpress sux) ..
[13:56:06] <duch_kazatel> jParkton :)
[13:56:11] <duch_kazatel> jfranks noConflict is your issue.
[13:56:19] <jfranks> Yep.. I think so..
[13:56:37] <duch_kazatel> $ gets aliased to document.querySelectorAll() under the hood in chrome's console.
[13:56:44] <duch_kazatel> *if nothing else on the page is using it.
[13:56:55] <jfranks> Right! ... I started with jQuery and then slip back to $() .. derp
[13:57:21] <Tomashe> someone here suggest me to covert my object into string using toString() bt that gives me something like that : [object Object],[object Object]
[13:57:24] <Tomashe> as text
[13:57:47] <duch_kazatel> jfranks you can also use a closure that lets you use $ again.
[13:57:51] <duch_kazatel> without turning noconflict off.
[13:58:16] <timgauthier> jfranks wordpress does suck, i recommend craft, perch, or kirbycms to replace it.
[13:58:24] <blindMoe> I normally do: jQuery(document).ready( function($) { .. }); so I can use $
[13:58:34] <blindMoe> timbur: have you ever actually used kirby?
[13:58:57] <blindMoe> I played with it for a minute... definitely an interesting approach.  It works a lot like an old CMS I wrote like 15 years back
[13:59:08] <blindMoe> timgauthier: ^
[13:59:10] <duch_kazatel> there's also (function($) {})(jQuery);
[13:59:29] <timgauthier> blindMoe yes i have used it several times, its pretty nice.
[13:59:40] <blindMoe> timgauthier: interesting.. I may need to give it a shot again
[13:59:47] <timgauthier> blindMoe i havn't used craft (which uses a syntax called twig) or perch (which is similar to kirby)
[14:00:17] <timgauthier> blindMoe i mean, you trade the greif of js for php but php IS nicer then js for most things ;) and all of them are written in php anyhow. you get to put your js in after though
[14:00:18] <blindMoe> I tried craft for a minute but it seems like they want to charge you for even basic functionality
[14:00:23] <blindMoe> never heard of Perch
[14:04:50] <GnuBoi> ls
[14:26:37] <timgauthier> blindMoe http://grabaperch.com
[14:26:59] <timgauthier> craft lets you download all of it to develop locally, but to publish yeah they want money for it all
[14:27:10] <blindMoe> timgauthier: just looked at it for minute.. want to look into the codebase deeper
[14:27:32] <timgauthier> i havn't tried it yet, seems to be the same business model as kirby
[14:47:21] <Tomashe> Hey guys, i got 2 objects, both contain same sub objects but by diffrent object order. i wonder if there is a way to merge one to another, but, also depend on one object .. for example if on object have 3 objects , 1 , 2 ,3 and the second object have 2,1,3,4 i want the new object to be 1,2,3,4 ... $.extends({},object1,object2) order object2 to object one and leave object1 positions
[14:47:22] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[14:48:47] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe whosawhatnow?
[14:48:53] <Tomashe> hehehe
[14:48:57] <duch_kazatel> you can't "guarantee order" with objects.
[14:49:03] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:49:09] <duch_kazatel> you could try to rely on it, but it's not apart of the formal spec.
[14:49:26] <Tomashe> i have a chat sapp
[14:49:39] <Tomashe> and when new data arrive as json i convert it to object.
[14:49:47] <adamellsworth> I have an issue implementing $.get(). My target is a .mustache template file in my ./public/, but the framework I'm using interprets /public as a Controller instead of a local directory.
[14:49:48] <Tomashe> using $.parseJSON
[14:50:23] <__joshua___> adamellsworth you aren't using a web server?
[14:50:29] <Tomashe> and i saw the last update on other object... but if a new msg comes it set the real new order on the new data object, but i still want to save the old data in memory
[14:50:41] <adamellsworth> apache
[14:52:01] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe i think you're confused about what JSON is and what "order" means.
[14:52:09] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe if order is important, use an array.
[14:52:29] <Tomashe> but my data from server comes as json
[14:52:38] <Tomashe> when i convert it object is made
[14:52:52] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe everything is an object.
[14:52:59] <duch_kazatel> push that data into an array if order is important.
[14:53:16] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:53:27] <Tomashe> i will try
[14:53:42] <duch_kazatel> but it really sounds like you're convoluting concepts here.
[14:53:49] <Tomashe> and then, that will work
[14:53:56] <Tomashe> $.extend({}, newData , chats);
[14:54:11] <duch_kazatel> you won't use extend in that case.
[14:54:26] <Tomashe> so how can i merge concat?
[14:54:41] <duch_kazatel> merge whatnow?
[14:54:49] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code please?
[14:54:52] <Tomashe> i told u , i have 2 objects
[14:54:56] <duch_kazatel> because you're making less and less sense.
[14:55:10] <Tomashe> the memory one can have 100 items.. and the new data from server only contain last 10
[14:55:12] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[14:55:40] <Tomashe> but if new msg comes and it already in the old data. i just want to move it to the beginnig
[14:55:41] <duch_kazatel> run a foreach on the new data to run a .push() on the old array.
[14:56:08] <Tomashe> i was sure there is a quicker way
[14:56:08] <duch_kazatel> this is getting really old...
[14:56:20] <Tomashe> like jquery MAGIC
[14:56:50] <duch_kazatel> if order matters, use an array.  if you need to check for duplicates between the two, you can also do that.
[14:57:07] <Tomashe> k
[14:57:08] <Tomashe> :)
[14:57:09] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:57:48] <duch_kazatel> you might want to check out underscore.js or lodash
[14:57:55] <Tomashe> which does?
[14:58:20] <duch_kazatel> they both include extra utility functions that make things like this pretty easy
[14:59:26] <Tomashe> ok thanks
[15:18:59] <opie-wrk> is there any ways to tell if it's a POST or GET from ajaxSend()
[15:20:13] <duch_kazatel> pass the third arg to the handler and log it out - might be in there.
[15:20:19] <opie-wrk> i think it is
[15:20:26] <opie-wrk> i was just dumping the arguments
[15:20:38] <thebope> good night everybody
[15:20:50] <thebope> hope your bowls are filled with grapes
[15:20:55] <thebope> and your wine tastes of elderberry
[15:21:01] <thebope> or something
[15:21:30] <opie-wrk> duch_kazatel: yeah it is on 3rd arg undertype. AHH, i miss read the docs page
[15:21:32] <duch_kazatel> opie-wrk it's the TYPE prop
[15:21:42] <opie-wrk> derp
[15:21:43] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:21:47] <duch_kazatel> it happens :)
[15:21:57] <opie-wrk> thanks
[16:08:15] <antlong_> how do you see what data is inside of a UIComponent in console
[16:19:10] <duch_kazatel> a whatnow?
[16:56:14] <__joshua___> if jq data, its in jQuery.data(el)
[16:56:49] <__joshua___> so jQuery.data(document.querySelector('myel)');  but then you might as well $('myel').data();
[16:59:18] <Fall> wee, jQuery!
[16:59:21] * Fall does a jig.
[17:09:56] <disappearedng> I have a bunch of tasks in a calendar and I want to spring up a nice pop up when my user clicks on one of the tasks, any recommendation?
[17:14:39] <Fraz> hey
[17:15:09] <Fraz> i was wondering if its possible to create a standalone application from a web based app im building
[17:15:11] <Fraz> any ideas?
[17:15:17] <r3wt> hi, quick question. Is there a way to have multiple if statements attached to a window resize event?
[17:15:51] <Fraz> how do you mean r3wt?
[17:16:21] <Fraz> $(window).resize(function(if if if if else if))?
[17:16:21] <r3wt> well, i have an if, and two else ifs, but only the second statement is firing
[17:16:37] <Fraz> oops function() {}
[17:18:05] <Fraz> why wouldnt you be able to have multiple if statements? it calls a function with whatever code you want in it
[17:18:16] <r3wt> i'm not that good with javascript. here's what i have so far. http://pastebin.com/fdgGJG8a
[17:20:09] <Fraz> are you sure that only the second statement isnt true?
[17:21:42] <r3wt> i'm thinking maybe i should use setInterval to periodically check the browser height so when the resize happens i can compare the previous height
[17:22:06] <Fraz> oh, actually, yeh i recall resize being a bit dodgy when resizing the window
[17:22:22] <Fraz> and i had to put in a periodic check
[17:22:56] <Fraz> i think that was because it was calling the function when the resize had been done though, rather than while resizing
[17:24:05] <Fraz> yeh i definately recall doing this. setting a .5 second interval or something when resizing
[17:25:52] <Fraz> saying that, i also recall using resize again since then, and it worked fine without an interval. could have been in 2 differnt browsers though
[17:26:33] <Fraz> id imagine different browsers fire the window resize callback at different times. some in real time, some when the resize is done
[17:27:31] <benlieb> can someone help me understand why this doesn't work: $('video').first.play(), but this does: document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].play()
[17:27:44] <benlieb> I'm getting TypeError: undefined is not a function
[17:27:47] <r3wt> crap, this isn't working
[17:27:50] <Fraz> so, any idea on if i can create a standalone app from a web based app? html/js/css only
[17:27:57] <Fall> first().play()?
[17:28:09] <Fall> benlieb: $('video').first().play()
[17:28:26] <benlieb> doesn't work either
[17:28:41] <benlieb> tried that and $('video').play()
[17:28:49] <Fall> Then your video element doesn't have a play method ;)
[17:28:58] <Fraz> isnt video a class?
[17:29:15] <benlieb> Fall: this works: document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].play()
[17:29:17] <Fraz> or is this some html stuff?
[17:29:21] <Fraz> html 5*
[17:29:34] <benlieb> Fraz: html5 vid

[17:30:45] <boov> hi
[17:30:52] <boov> where i can find young girls?
[17:31:02] <Fraz> wherever you arnt!!
[17:31:12] <Fall> boom.
[17:31:16] <benlieb> Fraz: don't feed the troll
[17:31:20] <benlieb> the grow
[17:31:27] <Fraz> but he looked so hungry
[17:31:52] <r3wt> what is wrong with this? var pheight = null; setInterval(function(pheight){		 	 pheight = $(window).height(); 	 return pheight; },1000);
[17:31:53] <benlieb> Fall: tnx
[17:31:59] <Fall> benlieb: pleasure
[17:32:28] <__joshua___> r3wt: a few things
[17:32:35] <Fraz> = null
[17:32:37] <Fraz> nooo
[17:32:46] <benlieb> Fall: so get() returns native dom el, but first() returns jQ el?
[17:32:57] <__joshua___> you callback doesnt take any args and shouldn't return anything
[17:32:58] <r3wt> thanks joshua, i'm fairly new to javascript and i don't quite understand variable scope yet
[17:33:01] <Fraz> you dont need to pass pheight for a start
[17:33:33] <Fraz> all setinterval does is call a specified block of code
[17:33:36] <r3wt> well i want another anonymous function to have access to that variable on window resize
[17:33:38] <decx> why check window height with an interval when there's a resize event?
[17:33:47] <Fraz> it had access to pheight cos thats already defined in the outer scope
[17:34:24] * r3wt is so confused
[17:36:01] <Fraz> r3wt, var pheight = setInterval(function() {pheight = $(window).height(); console.log(pheight); });
[17:36:17] <Fraz> basically do your stuff inside that function
[17:36:26] <r3wt> i tried it like that Fraz
[17:36:34] <__joshua___> what, don't assign pheight
[17:36:45] <Fraz> yeh you don even need to assign it
[17:36:59] <__joshua___> only assign if you want to cancel
[17:37:10] <Fraz> wait i failed there
[17:37:15] <r3wt> does anyone mind to look at the live code? its immediately inside of the $(function(){
[17:37:19] <r3wt> document ready
[17:37:32] <__joshua___> and don't use setInterval.  use $(window).on('resize, function(){ pheight = $(window).height(); });
[17:37:48] <r3wt> joshua, i already know how to get the height
[17:38:02] <r3wt> i'm trying to have a previous height passed into the resize event
[17:38:28] <r3wt> if(pheight < 1200 && h > 1200)
[17:38:38] <__joshua___> var previous_height;  $(window).on('resize, function(){ /* previous_height stuff */    previous_height = $(window).height(); });
[17:39:20] <r3wt> wouldn't that only work for one resize though?
[17:39:38] <__joshua___> only if you did  $(window).once(....
[17:39:52] <r3wt> does onresize fire before or after the resize completes?
[17:40:10] <__joshua___> browser dependant.  actual answer:  afterwards.
[17:40:20] <__joshua___> typically.
[17:40:34] <r3wt> do you understand then when i need the previous height and the height after the resize?
[17:40:57] <Fall> benlieb: correct
[17:40:59] <__joshua___> yes.  my example will do this.  if you add the missing '
[17:41:44] <benlieb> Fall: is get(0) the normal way to get the native dom el?
[17:41:49] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/HHyvN/ << but its not outputting the corrext height
[17:42:08] <benlieb> Fall: would I always to $('#myid').get(0) to get the element?
[17:42:15] <__joshua___> you mostly see $(query)[0] in code, but get(0) is probably better
[17:42:15] <benlieb> if I wanted to use jQ?
[17:42:37] <Fraz> its always outputting 345
[17:43:05] <benlieb> __joshua___: interesting
[17:43:12] <benlieb> they do the same thing
[17:43:15] <__joshua___> benlieb: if you want single jquery wrapped element use .eq(0)
[17:43:37] <r3wt> __joshua__ that doesn't making any sense.
[17:44:00] <Fall> benlieb: I've never seen that used before, as the jQuery docs state that GET is for XHR stuff.
[17:44:04] <r3wt> window resize inside the resize event would return the new height
[17:44:10] <__joshua___> $('div');   // length = 10;      $('div').eq(3);  /// length = 1;
[17:44:12] <r3wt> i need a before, after
[17:44:24] <benlieb> Fall: I think that is referring to an HTML GET request
[17:44:31] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/HHyvN/ this is working as i resize, but still only outputting 345
[17:44:34] <benlieb> HTTP
[17:44:34] <benlieb> rather
[17:44:51] <Fall> benlieb: you are correct
[17:45:33] <__joshua___> r3wt: you have a before.   var previous_height=  $(window).height();  $(window).on('resize', function(){ /* previous_height stuff */    previous_height = $(window).height(); });
[17:45:37] <__joshua___> run that code and see.
[17:46:04] <__joshua___> where is says  /* previous_height stuff */  put whatever you are doing with old height in there
[17:46:04] <Fraz> i wanna know why jsfiddle is lieing about my window height:P
[17:46:06] <r3wt> but joshua that will only work for one resize
[17:46:22] <Fraz> oh
[17:46:23] <Fraz> nm
[17:46:24] <r3wt> how will var previous height be set to the new value
[17:46:27] <__joshua___> no, 'on' bind events untill you 'off'
[17:46:40] <__joshua___> with the statement ' previous_height = $(window).height(); '
[17:46:48] <r3wt> oh, i see. i cn set the new height inside the event and it will be available to the above scope?
[17:47:14] <__joshua___> yes.  because we declared var previous_height outside the scope of the event handler
[17:48:40] <__joshua___> Fraz: the 'window' is probably the fiddles iframe
[17:49:23] <r3wt> well, my code still doesn't work and i don't know why
[17:50:08] <Fall> benlieb: this is also interesting" http://wonderdesigners.com/?p=219
[17:52:30] <r3wt> video js is pretty awesome. with a few css speaks, you can get it to resize flawlessly in a resposivel layout while maintaining a 16:9 aspect ration
[17:55:27] <benlieb> Fall: interesting. I wonder if it gives you anything that the dom el doesn't already give you. Guess I could read the source. But it seems if a browser supports html5 video, then the interface would probably be to spec, so no abstraction via jQ would be needed.
[17:59:34] <ashgotti> Good evening all. I need ab it of help with a simple-ish project. There are 5 pages, 1 frontpage and 4 subpages. On the 1st page I have a cookie created, when the user goes to a subpage and back to the frontpage, it doesn't see the cookie. I created a function to check for a cookie and if it exists, do X. The function is not run when the user clicks back but does if the user refreshes. So I binded the back button to the function to check for the cookie and 
[18:01:24] <ashgotti> I don't know the trick for jquery-mobile on where to place JS for it to fire when the user navigates. I ahve the 4 subpages prefetching
[18:06:11] <r3wt> you have to set the path for the $.cookie
[18:06:37] <r3wt> $.cookie('age_verification','no',{path: '/', expires: 365 });
[18:06:50] <ashgotti> r3wt? The cookie creation works, no problems with that part.
[18:07:29] <ashgotti> r3wt: http://jsfiddle.net/JJLRT/
[18:07:45] <GuestUser123> default path is already /
[18:08:17] <r3wt> !== yes isn't correct comparison operator
[18:09:39] <ashgotti> the issue I'm having is when the user navigates around, checkCookie(); is not run again. it only is if the page is reloaded, not by going "back"
[18:10:28] <r3wt> maybe the dom isn't reloaded?
[18:10:39] <ashgotti> seems like it
[18:15:03] <r3wt> anyone can help me?

[19:18:43] <DragoonDM> Hey guys, I have an issue I'm hoping someone here might be able to help me with. I have an event that calls .blur() on all of the buttons on the page (   $('.btn').blur()   ), but this doesn't seem to function properly in my phone's broswer (Samsung Galaxy S5, Chrome). Works fine in Chrome, Firefox, and IE on my desktop. Is there any way to fix this?
[19:18:59] <DragoonDM> URL for reference: http://kana.ninja/
[19:24:32] <styol> DragoonDM: not the issue, but you should consider caching selected elements. IE: var msg = $('.answer-message'); msg.html(''); /* perhaps .empty() instead */ msg.css('opacity', 1); and you might also be able to chain them -- msg.empty().show();
[19:25:49] <styol> DragoonDM: there could be a javascript error in getNewKana() preventing the execution from completing and reaching the blur. Check out weinre for remote debugging on mobile devices and otherwise
[19:26:21] <DragoonDM> I'll look into that, thanks.
[19:27:01] <styol> no problem
[19:27:54] <styol> DragoonDM: toggleClass may be of interest also
[19:29:00] <DragoonDM> Ooh, yeah. Thanks.

[21:48:03] <Streusel> How do I get my javascript to give me an alert if I click a span tag? :|
[21:48:24] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code?
[21:48:24] <systemfault> with the .on function
[21:48:42] <Streusel> What I tried was this: $('span').click(function(){//stuff});
[21:48:56] <duch_kazatel> Streusel did you put that in a doc ready?
[21:48:59] <duch_kazatel> or after your html?
[21:49:31] <Streusel> I placed it after I loaded jquery
[21:49:47] <duch_kazatel> you need to use a document ready or put it after your html.
[21:49:57] <duch_kazatel> otherwise the html doesn't yet exist and you can't bind.
[21:50:13] <Streusel> ahh right yeah
[21:50:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/CXw6h/1/'
[21:51:14] <duch_kazatel> woops - http://jsfiddle.net/CXw6h/1/
[21:51:24] <Streusel> let me boot up my debian so I can say what I got
[21:51:52] <Streusel> oh it's on.('click' now?
[21:52:19] <duch_kazatel> .click() maps to that under the hood.
[21:52:26] <duch_kazatel> same thing otherwise.
[21:57:49] <Streusel> ahh, had the document.ready missing
[21:57:56] <Streusel> thank you duch_kazatel
[21:58:03] <duch_kazatel> that part make sense?
[21:58:09] <Streusel> oh totally
[21:58:15] <duch_kazatel> again, you could put your js after your html instead.
[21:58:19] <Streusel> I was working inside an old anonymous function
[21:58:21] <duch_kazatel> both will basically do the same thing.
[21:58:28] <Streusel> I hadn't bothered to actually check what it did :x
[21:58:38] <duch_kazatel> hah
[21:59:14] <Streusel> true but these online "ranking" sites sometimes give me shit how I have inline css or js
[21:59:19] <Streusel> so I try to keep it out
[21:59:33] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't ever use inlines...
[22:10:59] <tw2113> stuff like that makes me not like .css() much
[22:11:20] <tw2113> i'd rather predefine styles if possible and toggleClass()
[22:11:42] <duch_kazatel> i tend to favor addClass and removeClass
[22:12:16] <Windowsius> hello
[22:12:29] <Windowsius> If I want to get the format April 2014
[22:12:32] <Windowsius> I know yyyy is 2014
[22:12:37] <Windowsius> but what is the April component?
[22:13:00] <duch_kazatel> Windowsius depends on what you're getting the date from.
[22:13:32] <Windowsius> never mind
[22:13:35] <Windowsius> i found it to be MM
[22:13:46] <Windowsius> I thought it was F like php
[22:13:54] <duch_kazatel> from Date()?
[22:21:06] <mogaj> This code http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/zJV5Y/1/   works here but not in my code page what might be the problem?
[22:21:32] <duch_kazatel> mogaj any errors?
[22:21:44] <duch_kazatel> also - does the input get added after pageload?
[22:21:50] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, yes
[22:22:11] <duch_kazatel> to which?
[22:22:13] <duch_kazatel> the latter?
[22:22:23] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, input get added after pageload  .... no errors
[22:22:34] <duch_kazatel> you need event delegation then.
[22:22:41] <duch_kazatel> what container do you append the input to?
[22:23:22] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', '#asset-3', function() { /* your code here */ });
[22:23:24] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, <div id='asssets'></div>
[22:23:44] <duch_kazatel> then you'll use $(#assets').on('click', '#asset-3', function() { /* your code here */ });
[22:24:19] <mogaj> can i replace #asset-3 with name=asset?
[22:24:22] <duch_kazatel> also - no need to prepend your selector with the tag name.  in fact, that might make things slower in some cases :)
[22:24:40] <duch_kazatel> i would avoid using attribute selectors, but yes.
[22:24:45] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[22:24:47] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:24:55] <mogaj> thankyou
[22:25:00] <duch_kazatel> the docs will tell you that any valid selector can be used in that second arg.
[22:40:11] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, still not working here but works here  http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/zJV5Y/8/
[22:40:43] <duch_kazatel> does that parent exist on pageload?
[22:40:48] <duch_kazatel> or do you append that, too?
[22:43:14] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, the parent exists on pageload
[22:43:43] <duch_kazatel> mogaj { name:"asset" } is not a valid selector...
[22:44:34] <mogaj> duch_kazatel, how shud i use to get value of clicked radio button if there are bunch of radio buttons
[22:44:40] <mogaj> ?
[22:45:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/zJV5Y/9/
[22:45:18] <duch_kazatel> like that.
[22:45:59] <duch_kazatel> use change, not click.  bind a delegated listener to the parent that listens to all change events on children, then use $(this) to refer to the changed input.
[22:46:08] <duch_kazatel> finally, get the value of that input using .val()
[22:56:41] <antlong_> can someone please help me figure out why the content under the anchors is not appearing? s/s: http://imgur.com/o363V9Q  code: http://jsfiddle.net/ynr9c/1/
[23:14:19] <sacho> what anchors
[23:27:29] <Kira> I'm confused. Is it customary for plugins to accept events by calling them with a string?
[23:27:50] <Kira> e.g. $(selector).tooltip("destroy")
[23:28:06] <Kira> pretend that "tooltip" is a jquery plugin.
[23:29:22] <mogaj> How to get text box value when value changed?
[23:31:02] <SDr> hi guys, I'm looking at https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/RecordRTC/AudioVideo-on-Firefox.html & Whammy ( http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/whammy-a-real-time-javascript-webm-encoder/ ) for in-browser video encoding; but is there anything that might work cross-browser? (specifically both firefox & chrome?)
[23:31:54] <ney> Hello, I am facing a problem with jquery keyup function.  I wrote a script such that when username and password are of length < 5 the signup button is disabled. After typing in username and password of more than 5 characters the signup gets activated which is working as it should but when i reduce the username or password to less than 5 characters the signup button is now not disabled.The jsbin can be found here http://jsbin.com/joguvosa
[23:33:12] <SDr> ah, recordRTC. thank you!
[23:34:31] <Cork> mogaj: what it changed?
[23:34:43] <Cork> mogaj: you mean when the user has changed the value of the field?
[23:35:15] <Cork> Kira: that isn't an event it is a function call
[23:35:48] <Cork> Kira: $(selector).tooltip("destroy") is a syntax form similar to $(selector).tooltip.destroy()
[23:36:44] <Kira> Cork: and so whenever plugin authors mention "custom events", they should always be like $(selector).trigger("custom event name")?
[23:36:48] <mogaj> Cork, initially it is blank ... when user enters value need to get the value
[23:36:55] <Cork> no
[23:37:27] <Cork> when plugins trigger events (at least if they are using widgetfaktory) they use _trigger()
[23:37:50] <Cork> mogaj: bind an input event
[23:38:31] <Cork> Kira: but other then that ya
[23:38:32] <zagaza> hi guys.. just a quick noob question.. why do I get TypeError undefined and stuff when I use $ but when I use jQuery eveything works good?
[23:38:47] <Kira> Let's take the carouFredSel plugin as a more concrete example. The documentation lists a bunch of custom events, but there is no example whatsoever. http://docs.dev7studios.com/jquery-plugins/caroufredsel-advanced
[23:38:56] <Cork> zagaza: sounds like you have another plugin that uses $
[23:39:08] <Cork> zagaza: or your calling noConflict()
[23:39:38] <Kira> Cork: isn't that somewhat dangerous? What if I have used more than one plugin on an element?
[23:39:43] <zagaza> Cork: ah I see, I am not calling noConflict however
[23:39:46] <Kira> And the custom event names clash.
[23:40:03] <Cork> Kira: sure
[23:40:20] <Cork> not a problem in practice as far as i know though
[23:40:47] <Kira> And so it would make sense for plugin authors to namespace their custom event names.
[23:40:56] <Cork> Kira: not really
[23:41:17] <Cork> you can if it is desperately important to get an unique event
[23:41:37] <Cork> but normally what caused the event isn't terribly important in events
[23:41:48] <zagaza> Cork: basically what I am looking for is this, I am having a typeerror problem but can't solve it for the world: http://peterlandgren.se/offert/
[23:42:28] <zagaza> if u check the console, I got some "anonymous function" which I am calling like this: jQuery('iframe').iFrameResize();
[23:43:28] <Cork> zagaza: find a version of iframeResizer that isn't minified
[23:43:36] <Cork> and you might have an easier time finding what happens
[23:44:44] <Kira> I see. Thanks, Cork.
[23:45:01] <zagaza> Cork here is the unminified one https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/master/src/iframeResizer.js
[23:45:17] <Cork> zagaza: its needed in the page not as a dead file
[23:45:23] <zagaza> word :)
[23:45:58] <mogaj> Cork, am trying this to get input textbox value but not working http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/D3hbL/1/
[23:46:10] <zagaza> don't have access to upload it now but i'll try setting that iframe communication up with postmessage instead, this plugin rips my hair out
[23:46:41] <Cork> zagaza: i'm not going to sit and debug a minified script sorry
[23:47:09] <zagaza> Cork: it's ok I am not expecting you to .)
[23:47:12] <zagaza> thanks anyway
[23:47:25] <Cork> mogaj: doscument <--
