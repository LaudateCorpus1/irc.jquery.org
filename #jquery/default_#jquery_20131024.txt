[00:01:03] <jnhghy> I'm trying to make a small subscribe overlay window that has some jquery elements, at this point I have a hard time making jquery capture a click on a div I have the code here: http://pastebin.com/T30XAMh9
[00:02:42] <jnhghy> I also have link to live site (you'll have to make a search in inspect as the subscribe window has display: none by default ->live site...)
[00:03:36] <jphase> jnhghy: what seems to be the problem?
[00:03:52] <jphase> I mean, i see a few things
[00:04:39] <jnhghy> jphase: when I click the #nosub div nothing happens ... I don't get the alert (at this point I have that alert but was not triggering the function so I couldn't hide the overlay...)
[00:05:02] <jphase> jnhghy: may I make a few suggestions here?
[00:05:10] <jnhghy> jphase: please
[00:05:21] <Ububegin>  http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/4/
[00:05:38] <jphase> jnhghy: let me rework this a tad, sec
[00:06:01] <fRAiLtY-> Hello, can anyone advise why I'm getting the fancy box error in console as it's effecting further script execution, http://diocese.bendart.co.uk/products/a6-notecards.html jQuery is included before fancy box etc but it keeps erroring :x
[00:12:38] <jphase> jnhghy: what's the #nosub ?
[00:12:48] <jphase> is that supposed to be on top of your overlay?
[00:13:41] <jphase> jnhghy: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/nGFN5/1/
[00:14:02] <jnhghy> #nosub is a div that holds a text "I dont want to subscribe" -like it's above the overlay, above other divs (I see it as top layer). I have a css cursor:pointer on it that works so I'm guessing it's on top of everything
[00:15:30] <jnhghy> jphase: from the jsfiddle that you have linked I've noticed that I haven't wrapped my function inside (document).ready -> is this mandatory?(as side info...)
[00:15:58] <jphase> jnhghy: no, your function wrapper works just fine, I just did this one because it works on things with different conflict modes like wordpress and the like
[00:16:27] <jphase> I also like passing $ in those situations so I can still use $ no matter which conflict mode is being used
[00:16:51] <Ububegin>  http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/4/
[00:17:10] <jphase> Ububegin: don't use [] in your push
[00:17:29] <jphase> oh wait, that's not the issue /facepalm
[00:17:44] <jphase> the vals aren't set
[00:17:45] <jnhghy> jphase: do you know if there is a a direct connection between css cursor:pointer and jquery .click? I mean ... if css cursor: pointer works -> would that automatically mean that the div is on top and that #div.click will aslo work? or it shouldn't be a default asumption?
[00:17:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you're loading a few fancybox extensions but never the fancybox plugin
[00:18:15] <jphase> jnhghy: no, css has no part of the jQuery click event
[00:18:24] <jphase> in*
[00:19:11] <jphase> jnhghy: div being on top or below is based entirely on css' z-indexing
[00:19:25] <Cork> well not entierly
[00:19:29] <jphase> oh?
[00:19:30] <Cork> but it is the main controller
[00:19:38] <jnhghy> jphase: got it working, thanks for your time and effort ...
[00:19:41] <Cork> there is other parts affecting it too
[00:20:06] <jphase> is there a different way of making elements in front/behind Cork? o_O
[00:20:31] <Ububegin> jphase: I want to do Map<string,list<string> > .. is it possible in jquery/js
[00:20:35] <Cork> jphase: display: static; z-index: 100000000000; will still be below display: absolute; z-index: 1;
[00:20:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Really? Line 55 on a view source shows jquery-fancybox or is this wrong?
[00:20:48] <Cork> there is a few other ones like that too
[00:20:59] <jphase> ohhh, right, combination of other properties yeah
[00:21:06] <jphase> I thought you meant there was some sorcery somewhere
[00:21:53] <jphase> hmmm, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/ ?
[00:22:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ugg sorry i missed it in the resource list (checked under f instead of j, sorry)
[00:23:17] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Cool, so any other suggestions as to why it's doing it? Starting to annoy me now
[00:23:31] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i suspect it adds it self to another objet
[00:23:39] <InFlames> can anyone guide me to instructions on how to manipulate the contents of an iframe that was injected into the page as html?
[00:23:39] <Cork> but i need to debug a bit to say if it is so
[00:24:00] <fRAiLtY-> Sounds complex :x
[00:25:07] <Ububegin> Cork:  I want to do Map<string,list<string> > .. is it possible in jquery/js
[00:26:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes you are loading two versions of jquery
[00:26:30] <Cork> jquery used when fancybox is loading isn't the same that is used when the page runs
[00:26:39] <Cork> $ in fancybox != jQuery
[00:27:14] <Cork> i suspect your loading some third party lib that adds it's own version of jquery or something
[00:27:26] <Cork> (those plugins should be killed)
[00:28:25] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Ah, script-ck.js has jQuery in the top of it. If it were you, which one would you ditch and would you move anything around?
[00:29:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: well the later one only supports ie9+
[00:29:49] <Cork> so if you care about that remove the later one
[00:30:15] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the other one is 1.8 so you might want to update it to 1.10
[00:30:34] <Cork> but make sure you don't break something through the upgrade
[00:30:45] <Cork> though if they worked with 2.0 it should be safe :)
[00:31:34] <Ububegin> Does anybody knows the soln... http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/4/
[00:34:55] <seutje> Ububegin: you can only push on to an array
[00:35:24] <seutje> so you need to make each of those keys an array, and it's usually better to use literal notation where possible
[00:35:30] <seutje> like http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/7/
[00:35:53] <Ububegin> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/5/ .. this works.. but later , how to add values for keys like d, e,f .
[00:36:38] <Cork> Ububegin: map["a"] = map["a"] || []; map["a"].push('')
[00:36:50] <Cork> if you want to dynamically add the arrays
[00:37:08] <seutje> yeah, just check for its existence first
[00:37:27] <Cork> map["a"] = map["a"] || []; <-- does just that
[00:37:47] <seutje> my linter complains when I quote keys like that :P
[00:38:07] <Cork> "a" ?
[00:38:09] <Cork> why?
[00:38:37] <seutje> apparently map.a is slightly more performant and less bytes over the wire
[00:38:47] <Cork> well ya
[00:39:06] <Cork> map[key] = map[key] || []; map[key].push(content);
[00:39:13] <Cork> that is the use case i was thinking of
[00:39:19] <seutje> uhu
[00:39:33] <Cork> you can't use that notation with dot
[00:39:37] <seutje> u can just grab the first letter of the word ur parsing
[00:39:41] <seutje> truth
[00:39:54] <seutje> but in that case, it won't complain, cause it makes sense :_
[00:39:55] <seutje> :)
[00:41:14] <Cork> eval('map.' + key + '=' + 'map.' + key + '||[];map.' + key + '=' + content);
[00:41:18] <Ububegin> Cork, seutje : http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/9/ .. Code looks darn long.. anyways to make it a function call, like push_check("apple") or something..
[00:41:18] <Cork> yay... not
[00:41:36] <seutje> lol
[00:42:28] <Ububegin> seutje: I just gave a trivial example.. my key is not the first letter of the word..
[00:44:12] <Cork> Ububegin: http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/11/
[00:44:25] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/12/ :P
[00:45:53] <seutje> I was considering to put a check in there to see if the first char was a space, and then just splice on to the next char, but you might want to index strings that start with a space separately
[00:46:28] <Cork> Ububegin: i think we both missed the last comment :)
[00:46:36] <Cork> "my key is not the first letter of the word" <--
[00:46:48] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  By the later one do you mean the jquery-min.js file or script-ck.js
[00:46:59] <Cork> script-ck.js
[00:47:06] <Cork> as it is the one loaded last
[00:47:14] <Cork> and the one the page actually uses
[00:47:23] <seutje> lol
[00:48:18] <Cork> Ububegin: but with that restraint; yes a function is prob the best option
[00:49:35] <Cork> that got me thinking; it would have been cool if undefined was an object, so you could set prototype on it :)
[00:50:41] <Ububegin> Cork: how could get all the keys and all the values.. for ( key in map) {print(map[key] )}
[00:51:02] <Cork> Object.keys()
[00:51:10] <Cork> Object.keys(map) that is
[00:51:18] <Cork> though it doesn't work in all browsers
[00:51:45] <Cork> alternatively ya you would have to use for key in map; just don't forget to check for hasOwnProperty
[00:52:04] <Cork> else you would look global object keys
[00:52:09] <Cork> *loop
[00:53:04] <Ububegin> Cork: Is there any issue in using.. for ( key in map) {print(map[key] )}
[00:53:09] <Cork> yes
[00:53:53] <Ububegin> Cork: Huh ???
[00:54:37] <Cork> js var o = { key1: 1, key2: 2 }; Object.prototype.woops = 'WRONG'; var a = []; for(key in o) { a.push(key + '=' + o[key]); } print(a.join(' '));
[00:54:47] <Cork> js> var o = { key1: 1, key2: 2 }; Object.prototype.woops = 'WRONG'; var a = []; for(key in o) { a.push(key + '=' + o[key]); } print(a.join(' '));
[00:54:52] <b-ot> Cork: key1=1 key2=2 woops=WRONG
[00:55:20] <Ububegin> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/15/ .. seems to work
[00:55:42] <Cork> js> var o = { key1: 1, key2: 2 }; Object.prototype.woops = 'WRONG'; var a = []; for(key in o) { if(o.hasOwnPrototype(key)) { a.push(key + '=' + o[key]); } } print(a.join(' '));
[00:55:47] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[00:56:02] <Cork> js> var o = { key1: 1, key2: 2 }; Object.prototype.woops = 'WRONG'; var a = []; for(key in o) { if(o.hasOwnProperty(key)) { a.push(key + '=' + o[key]); } } print(a.join(' '));
[00:56:07] <b-ot> Cork: key1=1 key2=2
[00:56:24] <Cork> Ububegin: that is why you need to check hasOwnProperty
[00:57:05] <Ububegin> Cork: Dont think I really get it...  Are you saying I just need to add hasOwnProperty() method
[00:57:41] <Cork> Ububegin: the jsfiddle doesn't use for(key in map)
[00:57:57] <Cork> but yes if you use for(key in map) you will need to check hasOwnProperty
[00:58:21] <Cork> else you can iterate what ever happens to exist on the prototype
[01:00:32] <seutje> then suddenly you have functions where you expect strings and all hell breaks loose
[01:00:52] <seutje> always a blast to debug
[01:01:12] <Cork> Ububegin: http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/16/
[01:01:30] <Cork> ya
[01:02:05] <Cork> i've had to monkey-match several libs cause of the assumption that Object.prototype is always empty
[01:03:51] <Ububegin> Cork: ah.. still, why did the Object.prototype.z get added to the map object ?
[01:04:01] <Cork> Ububegin: it didn't
[01:04:17] <Cork> Ububegin: but for( in ) doesn't only loop it's own keys
[01:04:38] <Cork> it loops all keys that is accessable on the object, including its prototype
[01:05:00] <Ububegin> Cork: kk, will use  if(o.hasOwnProperty(key)) all the time then
[01:05:15] <Cork> or just use $.each()
[01:05:22] <Cork> it does this by default
[01:07:46] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  script-ck.js contains loads of stuff relevant to the rest of the theme, would it have the same effect if I altered the order and put script-ck.js where jquery-min.js is and removed that?
[01:08:18] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you shouldn't use two versions of jquery
[01:08:30] <Cork> if your ok with using 2.0 use that
[01:08:32] <Cork> else remove it
[01:08:44] <Cork> *you're
[01:09:02] <fRAiLtY-> That's what I'm saying, but the jQuery included in script-ck.js is part of a bigger script, so it would be easier to include script-ck.js and remove the other one, provided this has the same effect?
[01:09:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: 2.0 won't support ie8 or older
[01:09:46] <Cork> though that said you could add in jquery 1.10 as a conditional comment for those browsers
[01:09:51] <Cork> and yes then it would work
[01:10:03] <fRAiLtY-> Ok cool I'll give it a whirl, thanks for your help!
[01:10:06] <Cork> (except if the script-ck adds things to jquery)
[01:10:13] <Cork> then it would break again
[01:10:35] <Cork> basically that kind of bundling should never be done
[01:10:37] <Cork> ever
[01:16:33] <titii> Hi
[01:17:07] <titii> How can i make an order to execute two onlick events on the same element?
[01:18:05] <Cork> titii: by not using event attributes or return false
[01:18:13] <Cork> then it would just work
[01:18:27] <titii> I have one onclick in the common scripts to expand/colapse the block, and the next aditional onclick event to rewrite html title to open/close
[01:18:44] <Cork> titii: you can ever only have one event attribute
[01:18:57] <Cork> if you add a new one you overwrite the old one
[01:19:20] <Cork> welcome to dom0 the new big thing in min 90's
[01:19:24] <Cork> *mid
[01:20:36] <titii> Cork, how can i rewrite the event?
[01:20:44] <Cork> use event listeners
[01:20:57] <Cork> that means don't add the event handling in the html
[01:22:22] <DieguezZ> hi, how can i close this modals when clicking outside and not only when clicking close button? http://jsfiddle.net/dKstV/1/#&togetherjs=206MVK5rBE
[01:25:46] <[E]sc> i can't seem to test this result, but when sort of data format is returned with the speed for position.coords.speed in geolocation? XXXm/s? XXXmi/h? etc?
[01:27:58] <Cork> [E]sc: http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/#speed
[01:28:06] <Cork> "current velocity and is specified in meters per second."
[01:31:58] <[E]sc> thanks so much Cork ... i was staring at the page hoping they had a chart layout for what i wanted...guess i should have looked at it more patiently.
[02:21:13] <LucaS05> hi. i'm using this script for filter a list http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/146/ but it's case sensitive. how can i make it non-case sensitive?
[02:25:22] <Clex> LucaS05: http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/233/
[02:28:22] <LucaS05> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/234/
[02:28:45] <LucaS05> if i search Item (with the capital I) it exlude it from the results
[02:29:00] <LucaS05> it doesn't have to exclude it
[02:31:20] <Cork> LucaS05: you need to lowercase both ends
[02:34:34] <LucaS05> what do you mean?
[02:36:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/236/
[02:36:53] <Cork> or you could just use regex
[02:42:10] <Cork> LucaS05: http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/239/
[02:44:55] <LucaS05> i've found this solution, without the usage of the regex http://jsfiddle.net/EFTZR/238/
[02:45:33] <Cork> LucaS05: then the 236 is most likely simpler
[02:47:19] <Cork> LucaS05: try searching for I in 238; it still breaks
[02:49:08] <LucaS05> mm...yes, so maybe the regex is foundamental!
[02:49:15] <Cork> no
[02:49:20] <Cork> 236 works too
[02:49:33] <Cork> though i would argue regex is simpler in this case
[02:51:18] <Cork> LucaS05: another problem with the other solution is that it doesn't support none english text
[02:52:29] <Cork> though toLocaleLowerCase could fix that problem
[03:00:31] <LucaS05> Thank you Cork ;)
[03:09:47] <christophrumpel> Hey everyone, i am struggeling with jquery offset and scrolling. Through a get parameter i get the id of the element i would like to scroll to. I then check the offset of that element and then i scroll to this element with the animate function (scrolltop), but the position is not the right one. I am working with inview.js too, this shows me the element if it is in the view, and when i console.log there the offset of that ele
[03:14:11] <sahbeewah> christophrumpel, post some code
[03:16:05] <christophrumpel> console.log('#x'); console.log($('#x').offset()); $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: ($('#x').offset().top)}, 'slow');
[03:16:33] <christophrumpel> here i check the offset and then the animation, but the position ist not correct
[03:19:09] <sahbeewah> .animate animates css properties
[03:19:20] <sahbeewah> take a look at the .scrollTop method
[03:19:31] <sahbeewah> http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[03:20:32] <Cork> no animate can animate scrollTop too
[03:21:46] <Cork> christophrumpel: you want position() not .offset()
[03:22:23] <Cork> though that said, i would recommend having a look at the scrollTo plugin
[03:22:32] <Cork> it makes moving elements into view really nice
[03:23:48] <sahbeewah> i stand corrected
[03:25:46] <christophrumpel> thx i will try that!
[03:26:15] <sahbeewah> why does he want position if he's dealing with offsets?
[03:41:44] <sunbeam> how can I detect if two object parents are the same?
[03:42:01] <Cork> sunbeam: you can't
[03:42:10] <Cork> you can check if you variables point to the same object
[03:42:33] <Cork> but if you want to compare if two object contains the same info you need to loop them
[03:43:41] <sunbeam> Cork: i mean
[03:43:48] <sunbeam> i do this:
[03:44:29] <sunbeam> var objects1 = $(".list").find("active");
[03:44:34] <sunbeam> then i want to for each
[03:44:48] <Cork> html doens't have an active element
[03:44:57] <sunbeam> .active Imean sorry
[03:45:00] <Cork> ok
[03:45:04] <sunbeam> var objects1 = $(".list").find(".active");
[03:45:27] <Cork> well elements can be compared so if that is what you want to do it is another matter
[03:45:54] <Cork> objects1.not(objects2)
[03:46:13] <Cork> though you should call it something that isn't indicating it should be an object
[03:46:18] <sunbeam> for eeach of those active
[03:46:25] <sunbeam> ehh no i want to get the ID of that active
[03:46:29] <sunbeam> the first active
[03:46:36] <sunbeam> that is found
[03:46:39] <sunbeam> with .find()
[03:46:48] <Cork> $(".list").find(".active").attr('id')
[03:47:02] <Cork> or just $(".list .active").attr('id')
[03:47:50] <sunbeam> Cork: but there are multiple active
[03:47:54] <sunbeam> so i would get more than 1 id right?
[03:47:58] <Cork> no
[03:48:01] <Cork> ?api attr
[03:48:01] <b-ot> Cork: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[03:48:08] <sunbeam> ahh good
[03:48:13] <sunbeam> why is this actually
[03:48:28] * Cork points at the documentation reference
[03:49:18] <sunbeam> ok
[03:49:20] <sunbeam> thnx
[03:49:37] <Cork> sunbeam: if you want all id's you would have to do something like $.map($(".list .active"), function(elm) { return $(this).attr('id'); })
[03:51:09] <jammsen> is there a selector for <ul id="converstation-a87a87a889787"> hiding stuff?
[03:51:19] <jammsen> i got many ul's with a random id
[03:51:31] <jammsen> onclick i want to hide all and show the clicked one
[03:51:32] <Cork> jammsen: then your html is invalid
[03:51:38] <Cork> by definition that isn't valid
[03:51:53] <jammsen> why?`
[03:51:56] <Cork> id is an unique identifyer for the element
[03:52:01] <Cork> there can ever only be one
[03:52:13] <Cork> if you want to reference many elements you use a class
[03:52:36] <jammsen> i use id to identify the certain element, whats wrong with that?
[03:52:55] <jammsen> its only one element with id converstation-a87a87a889787
[03:53:00] <Cork> jammsen: it works fine, as long as there is never more then one element with the same id
[03:53:14] <jammsen> it wont be a second one
[03:53:23] <Cork> ah, sorry i miss read you commend
[03:53:31] <jammsen> but how is the selector for this?
[03:53:35] <Cork> main part of my commend is still correct though
[03:53:40] <Cork> you use a class
[03:53:46] <Cork> or you have to list all the id's
[03:53:55] <jammsen> $("ul#conversation*").each(function(index) { doesnt work
[03:54:02] <Cork> nope
[03:54:08] <Cork> <ul id="converstation-a87a87a889787" class="conversation">
[03:54:16] <Cork> $('.conversation')
[03:54:34] <Cork> you can't make partial selections on an id
[03:54:52] <Cork> you would have to resort to attribute selection if you want to select on partials
[03:55:02] <Cork> but then you wouldn't get the speed from id's or classes
[03:55:18] <Cork> also don't add tag names infront of your id's
[03:55:56] <jammsen> okay
[03:56:09] <jammsen> how do i get the value of data-uid="test"?
[03:56:21] <Cork> .data('uid')
[03:56:41] <Cork> if you want to select on it you do $('ul[data-uid=""]')
[03:56:59] <Cork> then again that will loop all the ul's in the page checking its attribute
[04:28:10] <sasmit87> can anybody help me in jquery validator ?? I am really facing some troubles there
[04:29:22] <sasmit87> please...........
[04:30:05] <Clex> ?ask @ sasmit87
[04:30:05] <b-ot> sasmit87: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:34:52] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validator plugin for a form validation... The entire block is divided into different block school details, graduation details etc. How ever there are additional qualification which comes when you click on a add more button
[04:35:10] <sasmit87> and the ids of that form fileds are generated dynamically
[04:35:50] <sasmit87> I need to validate those form fields of an additonal block which are shown I mean display block
[04:38:42] <Ice_Strike> It seem <option style='display:none'> Should be hidden </option> does not work on Internet Explorer but it work Fine.
[04:39:12] <Ice_Strike> How to make jquery to loop through <option> and find display:none and remove it?
[04:40:35] <seutje> sasmit87: this example shows a custom method to check if the element being validated is in the current page: http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/ && http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod
[04:41:52] <seutje> or just .validate({ignore:":not(:visible)"}) lol
[04:42:32] <seutje> .validate({ignore:':hidden'})* my bad
[04:44:29] <seutje> Ice_Strike: that doesn't work on my chromesies either
[04:44:51] <raj> After clicking on "This is an item", I'm getting a 'dragging' event in the console, when everyone else gets a 'clicking' event http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/2/
[04:44:56] <raj> in windows chrome
[04:46:09] <Ice_Strike> seutje It work fine on Chrome Browser
[04:46:13] <Ice_Strike> but not on IE
[04:52:15] <abrkn> does any event fire when a dom element is removed?
[04:59:24] <Cork> abrkn: no
[04:59:54] <Cork> there is an upcoming standard for observers that would do that
[04:59:59] <Cork> but it isn't cross browser yet
[05:01:16] <abrkn> hmm, ok
[05:04:07] <beasty> Cork: !
[05:05:15] <seutje> abrkn: I once hijacked Node.prototype.removeChild for doing something similar, but I wouldn't recommend it
[05:05:30] <seutje> if it's for debugger, sure, but you don't wanna do that in production
[05:05:46] <PereP> hi all
[05:06:02] <PereP> I know how to apply some function to several selector, let's say...
[05:06:41] <PereP> $('.thisOnes, #thatOther').addClass('myClass');
[05:06:57] <PereP> now let's say I have the following vars:
[05:07:22] <PereP> myVar1 = $('.thisOnes');
[05:07:35] <PereP> myVar2 = $('.thatOther');
[05:08:02] <PereP> I know I can do myVar1.addClass('myClass') and myVar2.addClass('myClass')
[05:08:24] <PereP> is there a way todo (myVar1,myVar2).addClass('myClass'); ?
[05:09:38] <seutje> `api add
[05:09:38] <b-ot> seutje: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[05:09:43] <seutje> PereP: ^
[05:09:55] <seutje> myVar1.add(myVar2).doStuff()
[05:09:59] <PereP> aaaaaah
[05:10:16] <PereP> thanks a lot... I was just trying to write a bit less code
[05:10:43] <PereP> but maybe in this case I'll stuck to writing twice my .addClass for the sake of clarity xD
[05:10:45] <seutje> do note that like most jquery methods, it does not mutate the original collection, but returns a copy
[05:11:08] <seutje> you could do like var both = myVar1.add(myVar2); both.doStuff();
[05:20:43] <PereP> thanks a lot, suetje and b-ot
[05:24:17] <seutje> PereP: b-otis a bot, it was just replying to my commands
[05:24:57] <PereP> xDDDDD
[05:25:11] <PereP> I hope to remember it for the next time
[05:25:15] <PereP> gotta go... bye! ;)

[05:38:27] <mac__> hey

[05:38:58] <mac__> ?
[05:39:06] <sasmit87> what ever form fields are visible that should validate and the hidden form field ids are dynamically generated
[05:40:54] <sasmit87> any help ??  if anybody got my query
[05:44:25] <sasmit87> seutje: any help??
[05:44:49] <sasmit87> 1 hour deadline is there to fix this
[05:45:07] <seutje> lol
[05:45:12] <seutje> well I got shit to do
[05:48:19] <sahbeewah> 56 minutes remaining
[05:48:27] <Tee_Pee> Heya folks, quick question - I am trying to put up a confirmation window "are you sure you want to leave" on the jquery back button. It all works fine, when the user navigates A>B>C, hits back on C and refuses, he will stay on C as intended. However, hitting back and accepting will now take the user to A instead of B.
[05:48:57] <Tee_Pee> It's like the history entry was deleted, only the back action was prevented. Any way of stopping this?
[05:50:19] <sahbeewah> Tee_Pee, that doesn't sound right. put up an example?
[05:51:17] <Tee_Pee> gimme a minute
[05:51:31] <tubiz> duckgoose how can i use it for three file select
[05:52:21] <aro> how do i hide the tab content generated by jquery ui?
[05:52:32] <aro> all the tab blocks are loaded
[05:53:13] <duckgoose> well
[05:55:59] <Tee_Pee> sahbeewah - http://pastebin.com/erPRL5QL
[05:58:11] <duckgoose> tubiz http://pastie.org/8426773 something like this could work
[05:58:47] <duckgoose> each image thats read is appended to imgstore, so it's just a matter of adding event listeners to each input
[06:00:46] <Tee_Pee> No one got any ideas?
[06:01:20] <sahbeewah> hm, don't have experience with jqm
[06:01:31] <tubiz> duckgoose do I need to add anything to the various input file apart the id
[06:02:22] <sahbeewah> but i don't see how jqm could possibly prevent the back functionality, that seems to be a core feature of browsers
[06:02:36] <sahbeewah> the only way to truly alert it was to use the beforeunload method
[06:03:05] <sahbeewah> so my guess is returning false would not actually prevent the back, but rather prevent the change of the hash which jqm presumably deals with for navigation
[06:03:14] <duckgoose> tubiz the input just needs an event listener
[06:04:26] <tubiz> duckgoose is this ok <input type='file' id="imginput1" onchange="uploadFile(this);" />
[06:05:25] <duckgoose> looks ok to me
[06:08:57] <tubiz> duckgoose am getting this error message in the console Cannot call method 'addEventListener' of null
[06:13:58] <aro> jqueryui isnt hiding my tabs
[06:18:19] <sasmit87> http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/qualification/
[06:42:42] <duckgoose> tubiz http://haxed.net/uploadTest.html
[06:43:19] <tubiz> thanks
[06:47:07] <tubiz> duckgoose if an image is unselected how can I clear the preview, and is it possible to show the image file name beneath the preview
[06:50:39] <wwwroth> Cool to ask for assistance in here?
[06:50:47] <nafta> Good morning
[06:51:59] <wwwroth> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7137701 Line 4 log's "16" when the option selected is <option val="">-- Select One --</option> It seems instead of logging 0 which I want it to it logs the length of the text when the val is 0. Anyone ever come across this issue?
[06:52:27] <nafta> how can I check if I'm getting a var from $.get ?
[06:54:07] <wwwroth> nafta, $.get("page.php", function(data) { console.log(data); ); });
[06:54:20] <wwwroth> I'm pretty sure the contents of page.php will be stored as data which you can work with inside the function.
[06:54:39] <nafta> man this is so strange
[06:54:48] <nafta> I'm only getting one variable of the two I'm passing
[06:55:14] <wwwroth> I'm not sure how $.get works but I usually use $.ajax and on success() I pass through JSON data which I parse with JS. If you post your code I can help a bit more.
[06:56:11] <nafta> wanna take a look?
[06:56:13] <nafta> hold on
[06:56:17] <nafta> I'll set up a fiddle
[06:57:14] <nafta> wwwroth: take a look -> http://jsfiddle.net/PqkcH/
[06:57:16] <nafta> and thanks
[06:58:16] <nafta> the only variable I'm getting successfully is the first one
[06:58:23] <nafta> the second one won't go thru
[06:58:36] <nafta> and I'm updating the content of the first variable without issues
[07:01:08] <wwwroth> nafta, the code looks good. Alert or log both variables before the $.get and make sure they're set.
[07:01:34] <sasmit87> can anybody help me in jquery validator??
[07:02:24] <nafta> wwwroth: the second one…shows undefined
[07:03:08] <wwwroth> It's getting passed through but since it's undefined nothing is going :) That means talentosLast is not getting defined so on line 4 the selector is wrong.
[07:05:38] <nafta> wwwroth: so in that case if I do var talentosLast = 5
[07:05:42] <nafta> the 5 should pass
[07:05:43] <nafta> right?
[07:05:54] <wwwroth> Yes
[07:05:58] <wwwroth> Hard code it to be 5 and see if it works.
[07:06:13] <wwwroth> I don't use $.get often but I think you may also have a syntax problem. Try this. http://jsfiddle.net/3SUJB/
[07:06:29] <wwwroth> Instead of .done() I just used the callback function on the method itself to return data.
[07:12:11] <nafta> wwwroth: my problem is the selectro
[07:12:20] <wwwroth> Nice. Get it working?
[07:12:21] <nafta> can you please take a look at my code?
[07:12:27] <nafta> no it is not working
[07:12:32] <nafta> I used your code…the first thing works
[07:12:35] <wwwroth> Sure. If you need help with the selector send me the HTML mark up and the JS selector.
[07:12:35] <nafta> the second one...nope
[07:12:48] <utroda> Is there a way to get the ascii value for characters above 127?
[07:13:03] <nafta> wwwroth: I'm gonna do a pastebin..
[07:14:49] <nafta> wwwroth: http://pastebin.com/1fU02qtS
[07:14:52] <nafta> thanks a lot man
[07:15:07] <nafta> at the end..is the js part
[07:15:28] <wwwroth> talentosLast is the problem?
[07:15:53] <Chizbang> Sup everyone
[07:16:05] <Chizbang> Can somone give me some advice on XML parsing?
[07:16:26] <nafta> wwwroth: yes
[07:16:39] <wwwroth> nafta: Before we go any further go to your mysql_query. See where you put $interactivoLast right in your query and that's from a get variable?
[07:16:47] <Chizbang> I have an AJAX fetching an XML file from the web server
[07:16:48] <Chizbang> but then
[07:16:53] <wwwroth> That's vulnerable to SQL injections. wrap the variable with mysql_real_escape_string
[07:16:53] <Chizbang> I need to get the complete XML file
[07:16:56] <Chizbang> and send it out with AJAX
[07:17:04] <Chizbang> how do I get every line of the XML file to output?
[07:17:09] <Chizbang> It wont work for me
[07:17:11] <Chizbang> I have tried
[07:17:19] <Chizbang> console.log($(data).html());
[07:17:25] <nafta> wwwroth: yes
[07:17:27] <Chizbang> but that wont work. It just echos out unidentified
[07:17:43] <nafta> wwwroth: I understand…but this bug won't let me think in something else
[07:17:45] <nafta> lol
[07:18:01] <nafta> what I don't get is that one of the feeds is working
[07:18:07] <sl33k> hi guys
[07:18:09] <sl33k> need help
[07:18:15] <wwwroth> And as far as working on the selector I am not seeing any HTML elements with the class of "sidebar-feed-container"
[07:18:29] <sl33k> user requirements want me to show password text on click of a checkbox, but i'm not sure how to implement this at all
[07:18:31] <sl33k> :(
[07:19:01] <nafta> wwwroth: at the top 3rd line
[07:19:22] <wwwroth> got it.
[07:19:55] <nafta> the issue?!
[07:19:57] <nafta> really?
[07:20:35] <wwwroth> Ha, no, the selector.
[07:20:37] <wwwroth> I'll figure it out hold on.
[07:20:47] <nafta> oh lol ok, thanks again
[07:21:31] <tubiz> duckgoose are you still here
[07:21:42] <wwwroth> nafta, do me a favor. View the page once the PHP runs, copy the source and send that to me. It's hard to debug it because the PHP writes so much markup.
[07:22:31] <nafta> alright
[07:26:53] <sekyms> is it possible to set a listener for the onSelect event in the jQuery UI Date Picker?
[07:28:59] <grafi> sure
[07:30:25] <sekyms> grafi was that in acknowledgment to my question?
[07:30:35] <grafi> yup
[07:30:45] <sekyms> could you enlighten me?
[07:32:32] <grafi> did you check the api page for the datepicker?
[07:32:37] <grafi> there are events listed
[07:32:51] <koneko> The datepicker widget has no events I know of
[07:33:01] <sekyms> yeah i didn't think it did
[07:33:09] <sekyms> koneko: any tricks you know of
[07:33:09] <bberry> Hey guys, i have an $.ajax call that looks like http://jsfiddle.net/HjpJX/  The .fail always runs because my shell script (the ../cgi/jsontofile.sh) returns nothing but the content type.  Is there a way to set it up so that i can tell the ajax call to not expect any response?
[07:33:28] <bberry> I could just send something like echo '{}' in my script
[07:33:34] <bberry> but meh, i like things to be clean haha
[07:33:35] <grafi> sekyms http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/dfFUt/ like that
[07:33:43] <koneko> sekyms, You can listen on $(document) for a click and filter it down to the element you're interested in.
[07:33:55] <sekyms> koneko yeah I was afraid of that
[07:33:56] <sekyms> thank you
[07:34:02] <grafi> sekyms dont do that
[07:34:02] <grafi> :P
[07:34:18] <grafi> koneko look at the api page
[07:34:19] <sekyms> grafi: there is no other way that Im aware of with the date picker
[07:34:26] <grafi> koneko tons of events
[07:34:31] <grafi> [16:33:30] <grafi> sekyms http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/dfFUt/ like that
[07:35:03] <bberry> also, the script runs fine, so there isnt any problem with that, it is solely with the response that my js is receiving
[07:35:05] <sekyms> yeah, not we're talking about grafi
[07:35:37] <koneko> grafi, these are callbacks
[07:35:52] <grafi> callbacks to events
[07:35:57] <grafi> that the datepicker issues
[07:36:19] <koneko> Can you listen to it with .on()?
[07:36:21] <grafi> event handlers are callbacks too, no?
[07:36:28] <grafi> you dont need to
[07:37:10] <grafi> just assign whatever function you want to "handle" the event to the onSelect
[07:37:19] <grafi> and it will be called when the event happened
[07:37:19] <sekyms> you cant
[07:37:39] <sekyms> i want to listen from somewhere else
[07:37:50] <grafi> like where?
[07:37:53] <grafi> and why
[07:37:55] <koneko> grafi, I agree, it will be called when you want it, I merely want to note that the select doesn't trigger an event
[07:38:12] <sekyms> to different modules
[07:38:12] <grafi> but it does
[07:38:14] <sekyms> unrelated
[07:38:18] <sekyms> but they share a date picer
[07:38:21] <sekyms> picker
[07:38:28] <sekyms> don't want to call modules two from module one
[07:38:32] <grafi> i mean
[07:38:39] <sekyms> dont want to initiate the date picker twice
[07:38:47] <sekyms> |
[07:39:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> wwwroth: hey um nafta and i would like to thank you for your suggestion....it turns out you were right the selector had issue
[07:40:21] <grafi> sekyms so what about triggering some event inside the onSelect ?
[07:40:23] <sekyms> i want to listen to the on select firing
[07:40:26] <wwwroth> Rohan_BHangui: You got it working?
[07:40:32] <koneko> grafi, if you can't listen to it via .on() then there's no event triggered
[07:40:39] <sekyms> yeah you cant
[07:40:44] <sekyms> there seems to be no event triggered
[07:40:51] <koneko> so it's all just callbacks
[07:41:00] <nafta> yes…it is working now wwwroth
[07:41:03] <nafta> thanks a ton
[07:41:15] <wwwroth> nafta: you're welcome, good luck with the project.
[07:41:31] <koneko> But as I said sekyms - you might listen to $(document).on("click", ".selector .for .datepicker" , fn)
[07:41:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> wwwroth: well make shift have to work out some ui issues but ya its wokring
[07:41:42] <grafi> sekyms koneko http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/dfFUt/2/
[07:42:23] <sekyms> that might work
[07:42:42] <koneko> grafi, might work, if he can modify the place the datepicker is created
[07:42:53] <sekyms> yeah that would be ok
[07:43:02] <grafi> cool stuff
[07:43:07] <sekyms> because its doing no harm if that event fires and nothing listens
[07:43:17] <koneko> yup
[07:43:21] <sekyms> thanks guys
[07:43:40] <sekyms> the junior here that I couldn't figure this out for thanks you
[07:44:01] <grafi> :)
[07:45:23] <sekyms> it's still kind of weird it doesn't fire any events though
[07:48:23] <Daniel_Be> I typically see plugins written to handle something from a selector, like  $(".selector").plugin();
[07:48:29] <Daniel_Be> I want to write something, possibly a plugin, to do form management of all the forms on my page, but that doesn't really rely on a selector
[07:48:39] <Daniel_Be> so do I still write that as a plugin?
[07:51:05] <grafi> what else would i rely on?
[07:52:57] <Daniel_Be> well, my form manager is a bit more self contained in the fact it doesn't need to rely on a selector to tell it what forms to manage, since it will be managing all the forms
[07:53:21] <Daniel_Be> so I don't need a selector to feed into the plugin
[07:53:35] <Daniel_Be> I would have the plugin just go out and grab all the forms
[07:53:52] <bberry> is there a way to set a $.ajax call to not expect a response, so that when nothing comes back in the response, .done will still run?
[07:55:43] <Daniel_Be> so, for instance, in my case I would never call   $("a").formManager();  and nor would it be worth giving that option
[07:56:20] <grafi> so you want like $.formManager()
[07:56:31] <Daniel_Be> ah
[07:56:57] <Daniel_Be> make it a utility plugin then
[07:57:10] <grafi> seems only logical to me
[07:57:13] <Daniel_Be> ok, I wasn't sure where I should put it, but that would make sense
[07:57:25] <Daniel_Be> sorry, I've only used jQuery sparingly
[07:57:38] <Daniel_Be> I'm just starting to convert out of YUI more aggressively
[07:57:45] <grafi> maybe $().formManager() could work too, but that looks strange to me
[07:57:58] <Daniel_Be> agreed
[07:58:42] <ideea> рун р
[08:00:31] <sekyms> could call it on the document
[08:01:31] <Ray_> Hello guys! I have i big pain in da ass
[08:01:42] <grafi> tmi Ray_
[08:01:58] <ideea> thanks for info
[08:02:36] <ideea> Ray_, and how are you filling about it?
[08:03:05] <ideea> feel*
[08:05:03] <Ray_> Sooo about my pain...
[08:05:04] <Ray_> i need to highlight text in block with html styling (tinymce). But every plugin that i tried to use is not working with html content. May anyone can help me?
[08:05:15] <Ray_> Maybe*
[08:06:06] <ideea> Ray_, hey
[08:06:20] <ideea> dude, maybe its easier to write it by yourself?
[08:06:58] <ideea> sosni hujca, dude
[08:07:34] <andrew9183> dude bro
[08:12:22] <computer2000> anyone how can i wrap the first three words of a span into another span?
[08:14:27] <geiregjo> you think
[08:15:11] <radicalbiscuit> I'm telling a form to submit immediately following an ajax call. The ajax call works, but the form does not submit unless I use a setTimeout, and that doesn't work sometimes, depending on the latency.
[08:15:30] <radicalbiscuit> It doesn't matter if the ajax is async or not.
[08:15:53] <radicalbiscuit> I've tried 1.7.2 and 1.10.2
[08:16:52] <radicalbiscuit> I'm also using jQuery Mobile. The trigger of the function in question is a button inside a jQM popup, but I think that to be irrelevant.
[08:17:14] <radicalbiscuit> Or maybe not, since it still happens even when I remove the ajax call. But at any rate, stuff ain't working.
[08:18:21] <grafi> Ray_ how you mean highlight? like wrap in a span with some color set as background?
[08:18:28] <Ray_> grafi, yes
[08:19:16] <grafi> so whats the problem exactly?
[08:19:40] <grafi> e.g. what does the html look like, and why the plugins you tried failed
[08:19:51] <Ray_> 1 min
[08:19:57] <Ray_> I'll give an example
[08:20:10] <grafi> kk
[08:21:55] <Ray_> $html  = <p>Ratione su<strong>nt sed molesti</strong>as. A<em>met aut id quia n</em>on sequi itaque<span style="color: #ccffff;">. Corrupti neque</span> p<span style="background-color: #ff9900;">rovident est perferendis.</span></p>; Text in browser looks like "Ratione sunt sed molestias. Amet aut id quia non sequi itaque. Corrupti neque provident est perferendis." For example, i need to highlight "Ratione sunt sed"
[08:23:03] <grafi> i see
[08:23:21] <grafi> and thats also why the plugins fail ;)
[08:23:22] <Ray_> so it must look like <span class="hightlight"><p>Ratione su<strong>nt sed</span> molesti</strong>as. A<em>met aut id quia n</em>on sequi itaque<span style="color: #ccffff;">. Corrupti neque</span> p<span style="background-color: #ff9900;">rovident est perferendis.</span></p>
[08:23:30] <Ray_> yeah
[08:24:45] <grafi> but new element in the middle of a word, that seems odd too ;)
[08:24:54] <grafi>  su<strong>nt
[08:25:29] <grafi> If that weren't the case you could maybe apply the highlight class to the word individually
[08:31:04] <nafta> anyone familiar with making a social sharing button for content on a div?

[08:49:59] <jop007> json_encode needs some action while using html

[08:53:47] <pixelgremlins> hey I'm trying to add an error when ajax fails -- but I want it to fade out, and then reappear if the error happens again -- so say someone doesn't have permission, I want it to basically flash an error, then disappear, and if they try it again reflash the msg and disappear again... here's what I have: $('#error-code').text(ev.message).fadeOut( 1500, function(){}); -- this will do the trick the FIRST time, but not subseque
[08:53:48] <pixelgremlins> nt runs
[08:55:00] <pixelgremlins> #error-code is the id of an h2 tag fyi
[08:56:42] <jop007> ecode uri caused troubles
[08:56:58] <jop007> URI malformed
[09:07:34] <pixelgremlins> why does this only run first time-- not overwrite the text() function? $('#error-code').text(ev.message).fadeOut( 1500, function(){})
[09:08:26] <GreekFreak> hi all
[09:09:46] <GreekFreak> I have a jquery datatable, but when I try to display it in an element that's too narrow, instead of working with "overflow: auto" and displaying scroll bars on the parent element, it squishes the datatable _and_ shows scrollbars. How do I fix this?
[09:19:53] <pixelgremlins> why does this only run first time-- not overwrite the text() function? $('#error-code').text(ev.message).fadeOut( 1500, function(){})

[10:23:13] <grafi> duch_kazatel remember the polygon stuff? http://snapsvg.io/assets/images/background_2.svg
[10:27:58] <BillCriswell> lost_and_unfound: You can do like... $("[id^=search-]").each(function(){ var $search = $(this), id = $search.attr('id'); $search.select2(...); });
[10:28:19] <BillCriswell> lost_and_unfound: Then you can use id in select2.
[10:28:39] <lost_and_unfound> BillCriswell: thanks, will look into that... still learning the ropes with jquery =]
[10:28:42] <BillCriswell> lost_and_unfound: If you look through select2's documentation you may be able to find a better way, but I'm feeling lazy today.
[10:28:52] <BillCriswell> lost_and_unfound: Understood.
[10:29:08] <lost_and_unfound> BillCriswell: your advise has help more than my googling =]
[10:31:01] <sekyms> is there a way to get go(-1) to not fire if the last state was off the current domain?

[10:47:27] <krambiorix> shoky, ?
[10:47:28] <grafi> using !important is probably one thing xD

[10:47:50] <sekyms> ugh shoky I work at that kind of place
[10:48:06] <sekyms> i could ask if you have a specific question

[10:53:42] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/CA5tv/1/
[10:54:16] <grafi> krambiorix never ever ever use !important :D

[10:55:24] <grafi> krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/CA5tv/3/
[10:55:58] <grafi> also why not use css?
[11:00:15] <MaxSan> Hey
[11:00:21] <MaxSan>  'class:eq(0)'
[11:00:27] <MaxSan> what is that as a native css selector?
[11:00:39] <krambiorix> thanks BillCriswell grafi !
[11:00:50] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: No problemoooooo
[11:01:09] <krambiorix> but why is !important a no go?
[11:01:14] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: :first-child perhaps?
[11:01:23] <MaxSan> Oh i need a general one
[11:01:31] <MaxSan> cause there is multiple eq(2) etc
[11:02:06] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: :nth-child(2)
[11:02:19] <MaxSan> thanks
[11:02:32] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:03:04] <BillCriswell> I'd check on browser support for that though if it's something important.
[11:03:43] <MaxSan> Yeh im using it to convert into xpath
[11:03:44] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: ^
[11:03:46] <MaxSan> as its for selenium
[11:03:56] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: Is that the testing dealie?
[11:03:58] <MaxSan> phantomjs doesnt support it i think
[11:04:03] <BillCriswell> I need to play with that shit more.
[11:04:08] <MaxSan> its cool as fuck
[11:04:12] <MaxSan> we are parsing sites with it
[11:04:25] <MaxSan> not for testing, for getting data
[11:04:34] <MaxSan> and then working with the data automated
[11:04:36] <MaxSan> LD
[11:04:38] <MaxSan> :D
[11:05:16] <BillCriswell> Sounds like the god damn future.
[11:06:06] <MaxSan> haha yeh
[11:06:12] <MaxSan> im just getting into using jquery more now
[11:06:13] <mvpgraff> I have a datepicker and validation on a form, let's say a user has ie7 or ie8 where datepicker doesn't work most likely, wouldn't the validation still require the dickpicker field? I'm receiving submissions from users using both of those browsers with no dates, but the rest of the fields full.
[11:06:25] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: Ever see this? http://www.sikuli.org/
[11:06:47] <B0TTiG> Hi everyone
[11:07:01] <whatadewitt> hey, anyone in here good with jquery mobile? i'm having trouble getting my panel to show up on any pages outside of my first one after i navigate to a "child" page...
[11:08:22] <MaxSan> BillCriswell
[11:08:27] <MaxSan> Im not sure what im looking at yet
[11:08:31] <MaxSan> but i have this feeling it is awesome
[11:09:05] <B0TTiG> There is a section of a page im developing that has 6 buttons which control 6 expanding text sections. I would like to make it so that one section can be toggled at a time. When one section is expanded, any other expanded text will become hidden.
[11:09:09] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: Haha
[11:09:47] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: Sounds a lot like tabs.
[11:10:15] <LordThumper> Hi, does $.ajax fire any progress events, or call any function during upload progress?
[11:12:19] <BillCriswell> LordThumper: http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/ might help?
[11:12:49] <LordThumper> BillCriswell: awesome nice find
[11:14:03] <BillCriswell> I have a way with the Google.
[11:14:15] <BillCriswell> I don't mean to brag or nothin'.
[11:14:47] <LordThumper> heh
[11:15:03] <LordThumper> You're a Google whisperer
[11:17:02] <BillCriswell> I should get that on a business card.
[11:17:10] <BillCriswell> Though I really like the sound of "noted expert"
[11:18:41] <whatadewitt> when a page is "loaded" with jquery mobile it looks like it just appends the content to the bottom of the page... at that point i lose access to the leftpanel on the first page and even having a left panel on the new page can't be opened, i'm guessing?
[11:18:44] <BillCriswell> Just my name with the words "noted expert" under it... no phone number, email address or anything.
[11:19:21] <LordThumper> That's useful ;p
[11:24:13] <MaxSan> why must jquery and css have different selectors
[11:24:25] <MaxSan> and why cant they be supported by all browsers !
[11:24:30] <MaxSan> WHY !
[11:24:46] <jedimind> ... what
[11:24:53] <jedimind> how are jquery selectors different than css selectors?
[11:25:05] <MaxSan> :contains
[11:25:07] <MaxSan> :eq
[11:25:11] <MaxSan> both not css selectors
[11:25:39] <B0TTiG> anyone have a suggestion for my expanding text issue?
[11:27:19] <B0TTiG> I have 6 buttons, each control their own hidden expandable text. I would like to be able to expand only one at a time. If one is opened, all others should close.
[11:28:21] <kamo> hello all
[11:28:41] <kamo> I need to see some examples of iframes selectors
[11:28:41] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: http://jsbin.com/ikupOCI/1/edit?html,js,output I think is what you'd like.
[11:28:49] <kamo> please
[11:28:54] <BillCriswell> kamo: Content in an iframe?
[11:29:08] <kamo> Sure anythign with an iframe
[11:29:16] <kamo> *anything
[11:30:39] <BillCriswell> Is that supposed to be within an iframe?
[11:31:41] <BillCriswell> kamo: If the content of the iframe is on the same domain you can do $('iframe').contents().find('.whatever');
[11:32:28] <kamo> $('#test','iframe').contents().find('.whatever'); ?
[11:32:50] <kamo> This is what I am seeing in the product I am working on...
[11:35:58] <BillCriswell> kamo: I never tried it that way. You can try it and see.
[11:36:02] <BillCriswell> Ah, left.
[11:41:53] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: http://jsbin.com/ikupOCI/2/edit?html,js,output improved it slightly, did something I rarely do on the first one.
[11:48:21] <ollehar> how can I make jquery-ui dialog NOT close when window `x` is pressed?
[11:48:32] <ollehar> *dialog `x`
[11:48:33] <Syrit> guys, i think this code can be imporved right ?
[11:48:34] <Syrit> fieldset.parent().parent().prev().children().slideUp(function(){
[11:48:34] <Syrit>           $(this).remove();
[11:48:34] <Syrit>           });
[11:50:14] <postitnote> Am I crazy or does vine's embed js totally pollute the host page's namespace?  https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js
[11:52:08] <postitnote> I can't believe what I'm seeing here.
[11:54:24] <BillCriswell> Syrit: Looks as concise as I can think without seeing the markup.
[11:54:45] <Syrit> :D
[11:55:03] <Syrit> BillCriswell, should i gist the source html? or the Haml ?
[11:56:17] <BillCriswell> Syrit: The HTML would probably be best.
[11:57:31] <BillCriswell> Syrit: The .parent().parent() can be replaced with a .closest( someSelectorForTheGrandParent )
[11:58:06] <BillCriswell> Also, when you say improved are you thinking speed wise or readability?
[11:59:22] <Syrit> BillCriswell, i really don't know which matters more ? i am still new to jQuery, and when i read the code i wrote again, i felt that something is not really good
[11:59:28] <Syrit> BillCriswell, here is the source https://gist.github.com/anonymous/14a73db25ac30b2492f9
[12:00:11] <Syrit> BillCriswell, i did not use closest because it's a table, and you know, there are 2 close rows ! up and don !
[12:00:15] <Syrit> down*
[12:00:32] <BillCriswell> Syrit: .closest() is for parents
[12:00:38] <Syrit> oh !
[12:01:17] <BillCriswell> Syrit: So fieldset.closest('tr') is easier to follow than fieldset.parent().parent()
[12:01:48] <Syrit> right, but i wanted to skip the one containing the fieldset itself BillCriswell
[12:03:39] <BillCriswell> Syrit: fieldset.closest('tr').prev('.collapsable').find('td').slideUp() maybe?
[12:04:09] <mvpgraff> BillCriswell, is there a way of removing datepicker if its older than ie8? I'm getting issues with this and the validation where it's not loading the datepicker and the validation doesn't recognize it as a empty field.
[12:04:10] <Syrit> i will give it a try
[12:05:38] <Syrit> BillCriswell, $('fieldset').closest("tr").prev(); worked fine ! thanks
[12:07:09] <BillCriswell> Syrit: If you're using those IE conditionals on <html> you can do like.. $('html:not(.ie8) input.date').datepicker() maybe?
[12:07:10] <haizum> can't get my vimeo froogaloop to respond to a play event, driving me insane... any help is appreciated. http://pastebin.com/BktnHzAP
[12:07:23] <BillCriswell> Not Syrit, mvpgraff ^^
[12:07:50] <mvpgraff> Hmmm
[12:08:09] <mvpgraff> will try it and then work on something if it doesn't work, but thanks for the answer
[12:08:11] <mvpgraff> :D
[12:08:19] <mvpgraff> seems logical
[12:09:15] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: That's my goal.. but I miss often.
[12:10:12] <B0TTiG> BillCriswell: Your solution is very helpful
[12:10:22] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: Sweeeeeeet.
[12:11:02] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: http://jsbin.com/omEkase/1/edit?html,css,output It should work. I always just feel like I'm using :not() wrong
[12:12:05] <mvpgraff> kk cool thanks!
[12:19:18] <frank_o> Can anyone tell why http://jsbin.com/AquWANAJ/3/edit (http://i.imgur.com/BKkydaO.png) is producing "TypeError: Result of expression 'b.addListener' [undefined] is not a function" on Android 2.3 and iPhone 4? Works fine on newer browsers.
[12:21:32] <frank_o> * http://jsbin.com/AquWANAJ/6/edit sorry
[12:22:19] <frank_o> The problem occurred after I started using that global variable.
[12:23:14] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Does it work if you remove that global variable?
[12:23:24] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Yep
[12:23:41] <frank_o> Hold on let me verify that though
[12:26:20] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Actually no, http://jsbin.com/AquWANAJ/7/edit doesn't work either
[12:28:06] <frank_o> http://sparkbox.github.io/mediaCheck/ works fine though (Android 2.3)
[12:29:38] <B0TTiG> BillCriswell: I had one more question regarding the button solution you helped me with
[12:29:44] <gumble_> how do I append an <li><a></a></li> to my <ul>???
[12:30:35] <B0TTiG> BillCriswell: Can I set all of the sections to be hidden at the start? Instead of showing the first section by default?
[12:30:43] <BillCriswell> frank_o: I think the issue is just with the .bind(). Not sure how to debug it really.
[12:30:52] <NoiseEee> gumble_: one way would be $(myULReference).append('<li><a></a></li>');
[12:30:54] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: Just remove the .eq(0).trigger('click'); part.
[12:30:54] <gumble_> only append <li></li> all the time
[12:31:18] <dcrouch> I'm getting the following error TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseJSON' of undefined  When trying to use var obj = jQuery.parseJSON( '{ "name": "John" }' );  Any ideas why?
[12:32:05] <B0TTiG> BillCriswell: Perfect, thanks!
[12:32:07] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: Did you include jQuery?
[12:32:10] <BillCriswell> B0TTiG: No problem.
[12:32:34] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: Thinking maybe your jQuery is 404ing or some shit.
[12:32:47] <frank_o> hmm
[12:32:53] <bukka1> hello people
[12:32:53] <frank_o> Yeah most likely
[12:33:09] <bukka1> anyone here has good experience with jquery-ui?
[12:33:19] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Is the 4 running iOS7?
[12:33:30] <bukka1> I have an issue with droppable
[12:33:57] <bukka1> When I drag an element over another element it only registers as hover only when i cursor also goes over the element
[12:33:59] <shoky> frank_o: sounds like another instance of this issue  https://github.com/sparkbox/mediaCheck/issues/1
[12:33:59] <b-ot> shoky: Issue #1 by danwhite85 (8mon 2w ago): Object doesn't support property or method 'addListener'
[12:34:14] <bukka1> is there a way i can detect the exact moment when the two elements are over each other
[12:34:19] <bukka1> no matter my cursor pos
[12:34:36] <frank_o> BillCriswell: OS X 10.8.4 I think
[12:35:18] <BillCriswell> frank_o: What shoky linked to seems to have a solution.
[12:36:05] <NoiseEee> http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-over @ bukka1
[12:36:06] <jedimind> shoky provided a solutiokn?
[12:36:10] * jedimind marks the calendar
[12:36:25] <dcrouch> BillCriswell, yes it's being included.  http://fpaste.org/49313/13826433/
[12:36:32] <bukka1> NoiseEee will check thanks
[12:36:58] <bukka1> oh there is a tolerance property
[12:37:01] <bukka1> omg awesome
[12:37:02] <bukka1> thanks
[12:37:32] <gumble_> NoiseEee: that appended <li></li><a></a> for me. but i know just create the li seperatly, then append the a to it and the whole thing to the list. that works

[12:41:48] <dcrouch> BillCriswell, It's a Zendesk App that's running JQuery that posts to a webserver with a python back end, the result of the request comes back and that's what I'm looking for.  I'll try and separate to just get the jsonparse back.
[12:42:53] <shoky> raj:  add a $(window).on('mousemove'  event handler and log all changes to the cursor coordinates
[12:43:05] <raj> oh sweet, you're here
[12:43:07] <shoky> see if they change from your click to the "dragging" log
[12:43:25] <shoky> can tv you and do it with ya if you want
[12:43:44] <raj> would love that

[12:51:30] <shoky> tv show, raj was watching it.. or listening to it ;p
[12:54:32] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha oh.
[12:54:37] <BillCriswell> The song is bad ass.
[12:55:38] <BillCriswell> The video is also really cool. Something really cool techincally about it but I forget the details. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nTFjVm9sTQ
[13:02:29] <Blacksheep> hi guys i have problem with FF, when i use $("html body section article").children().css("-moz-transform", "scale(0.5)");
[13:02:39] <Blacksheep> it scales object but not distances between them
[13:02:43] <Blacksheep> like i Google chrome
[13:03:11] <Blacksheep> is there any way to scale also distances?
[13:09:55] <Blacksheep> ok i removed .children() and it scales ok... eh ff
[13:19:31] <joroci> hey, is there a way to sync async ajax requests?
[13:20:18] <joroci> not sure if the question is understandable
[13:22:25] <NoiseEee> joroci: you mean 'once all these async ajax requests have finished, do this' ?
[13:30:19] <joroci> i mean if i have an array with numbers 1 to 100
[13:30:59] <joroci> i want to loop through the numbers and make a request after the one if finished
[13:33:52] <NoiseEee> joroci: nope, don't understand
[13:42:14] <duch_kazatel> joroci like, you want to sequence ajax requests?
[13:42:22] <duch_kazatel> so one one completes, do the next one?
[13:46:20] <seekr> Hi, atomka!!  :)
[13:47:14] <jwmann> I have some javascript that enables an smooth auto scroll effect for anchors however, after cloning an element, clicking on those anchors seems to ignore that smooth auto scroll effect, Is this a shadow dom issue or something?
[13:48:12] <culh> $("input[type=text][class!='date']").(...)
[13:48:33] <culh> is this correct for selection all inputs type text without those that have class 'date' ?
[13:48:42] <culh> selecting*
[13:48:56] <dxdt> I'm too dumb to understand why this creates a loop: http://jsfiddle.net/wqKjQ/1/ Any help? I think it will increase my knowledge of .on().
[13:49:47] <jtal> I think that is saying whenever there is a click event, find all submit buttons and trigger a click
[13:52:48] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[13:52:55] <Bloomberg> Someone has worked with facybox plugin?
[13:52:59] <Bloomberg> fancybox*
[13:53:11] <InFlames> Bloomberg, i have, what's up
[13:54:01] <InFlames> also, like most irc channels, it's better to just ask your entire question rather than ask a piece of it, it helps people understand what you need and help you faster
[13:54:37] <Bloomberg> Thank you man, What happen is that I call the fancybox modal window the first time and works ok, but If I cloase and I not reload the page and I'm going to open again a new fancybox window show me " $.fancybox is not a function "
[13:54:38] <Bloomberg> Why?
[13:54:46] <dijitaltrix> Morning everybody..
[13:55:16] <InFlames> bloomerg, can you show me some code example i can test?
[13:55:32] <Bloomberg> Ok, let me see
[13:55:57] <sahbeewah> jwmann, put up a fiddle so people can help you
[13:56:07] <sahbeewah> you may have duplicate name/id which is stuffing it up
[13:56:28] <jwmann> I'll make a fiddle
[13:56:29] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/zHZ4t/
[13:56:30] <sahbeewah> culh, $('input[type=text]:not(.date)')
[13:56:34] <Bloomberg> See for example that script
[13:56:45] <dijitaltrix> I am creating a modal record editor, so I can click an id in a table and popup the modal, edit the fields and save to the database. I have two functions that work okay, one pops up the modal and populates it with data from the table row. The other function handles the POSTing of the data. I am stuck as to how best update the table row on success, anyone give me any pointers?
[13:56:49] <Bloomberg> For fix it I need to reload the page with that last line
[13:57:01] <Bloomberg> But don't like me
[13:57:12] <sahbeewah> dxdt, read up on "event bubbling"
[13:58:51] <sahbeewah> dijitaltrix, what have you tried? you should have a reference to the table row from the modal/data returned
[13:59:58] <dijitaltrix> shabeewah: yes I have the id I can find the row, I'm just stuck as to where to do the 'callback' as it doesn't fit in my existing to functions ModalEditor (loads editor) AjaxPOST (posts record ) both work ok
[14:00:14] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah sorry ^
[14:00:28] <dijitaltrix> (just figured out TAB autocompletion ;-)
[14:02:01] <sahbeewah> dijitaltrix, depends on how you've structured your code...
[14:02:33] <sahbeewah> but, latch on to the success callback of the post?
[14:02:51] <sayd> how does one run the qunit test with a jquery repo checkout
[14:03:17] <jwmann> sahbeewah: Here's the fiddle. - http://jsfiddle.net/Pzq5h/
[14:03:42] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah: yeah I'm wondering how best to do it.. I think I need to register some kind of callback after the ajaxpost has finished handling the response.. if the reponse status is ok then I want to close the modal and update the table row.. but how to register the callback or event whatever?
[14:06:16] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah: I think a callback is the best option here.. I might need to restructure the ajaxhandler thanks for the confirmation..
[14:08:14] <sahbeewah> jwmann, clone doesn't copy data/events by default, use .clone(true)
[14:09:07] <jwmann> sahbeewah: Sounds great, I'll try that out thanks
[14:09:58] <gumble_> why does list_item.append('<a href=' + product.link + '>' + product.titel + '</a>');      do "<a href='product.link'></a> product.titel" instead of how it should do it
[14:10:42] <sahbeewah> dijitaltrix, i'm not 100% what you're referring to when you say ajaxhandler. just call .done() on your .ajax call, no?
[14:10:55] <grafi> maaaan
[14:11:00] <grafi> this was fucking hard :D
[14:11:12] <grafi> BillCriswell http://codepen.io/mstoppert/full/Cmyug
[14:11:29] <sahbeewah> gumble_, you need to enclose your product.link in quotes
[14:11:37] <sahbeewah> gumble_, and sanitize your data, for that matter
[14:12:43] <gumble_> sahbeewah: how enclose it in quotes?? like that: list_item.append('<a href=' + product.link + '>' + 'product.titel' + '</a>');?? i don't want it as string
[14:12:49] <gumble_> or have I missunderstood something?
[14:13:43] <gumble_> and why sanitize it? if anyone wants to change the link, let him. nothing bad will happend?!
[14:13:52] <gumble_> he could just call that link anyways
[14:16:16] <BillCriswell> grafi: Awesome.
[14:16:23] <BillCriswell> I need to play with SVG some more.
[14:16:36] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah: I have the pretty standard button.asynch on click function ( $.post() form + data) .done { calls handleResponse() }
[14:16:41] <grafi> yeah its pretty handy
[14:17:10] <sahbeewah> gumble_, don't know what you're using it for, but it could be bad if others can be exposed to the link
[14:17:38] <sahbeewah> gumble_, post a fiddle if you're still having trouble
[14:19:04] <sahbeewah> dijitaltrix, why don't you close the modal/update the row inside the handleResponse?
[14:19:45] <joroci> hey, can someone help me please how to fix the progressbar to update here? http://jsfiddle.net/F5ZwB/4/
[14:19:58] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah: I could, but I wanted the handleResponse to be more generic.. hence trying to load a callback in there and override it somehow.. I'm just not sure how to architect it..
[14:23:02] <gumble_> sahbeewah: it works when I do it in jsfiddle :D seems the error is with me. but can you tell me why I should sanitize it? because I thought I don't need to, really interests me
[14:23:39] <gumble_> because it is just a link -> if the user is a bad user, he could change it -> but what would happend would be thtat the link redirects him somewhere he could go anyways or not?
[14:24:06] <sahbeewah> dijitaltrix, don't really follow. generic as in it handles responses from many different types of ajax requests? don't see why that's a problem... use conditional statements?
[14:24:08] <codephobic> hi
[14:24:34] <dijitaltrix> sahbeewah: yeah thats what I'm thinking now.. thanks again for the help
[14:24:51] <sahbeewah> gumble_, is the link shown to other people? what if in the link he puts in quotes and inserts his own html? and his own javascript?
[14:25:52] <joroci> someone please :)
[14:25:53] <gumble_> sahbeewah: but he only can change the js on his computer, he couldn't change the link direction for everyone?
[14:26:05] <codephobic> what's a good - robust - way to check if a dom element is empty? By empty I mean that it either contains only whitespaces or elements that only contain whitespaces.
[14:26:49] <codephobic> Been reading stackoverflow and there seems to be some concern regarding is(':empty') returning false positives.
[14:28:25] <Krinkle> sayd: git clone, npm install, grunt
[14:29:05] <Krinkle> be sure to run npm install; then you can run `grunt` and it should run the qunit tests
[14:29:17] <Krinkle> alternativelt, run npm install, and then open jquery/test in your browser
[14:29:55] <sahbeewah> gumble_, if the page is sharable/link he could share a broken page and cause an xss. again, i don't know what you're trying to achieve, so that's up to you to work out. as a general rule you should always sanitize
[14:30:21] <sahbeewah> codephobic, probably... $.trim(element.text()).length
[14:32:26] <codephobic> sahbeewah, I'm trying that one out right now... I didn't have much success with is(':empty'), hopefully this is robust.
[14:33:38] <Mrgoose> is there a channel for jquery mobile help
[14:35:43] <codephobic> sahbeewah, seems to catch everything I throw at it! Thanks! :)
[14:35:46] <codephobic> \quit
[14:49:18] <AntelopeSalad> is there a quick way to set a check changed event for an array of checkboxes and then if any of them change and at least one of them is checked then do something?
[14:55:05] <Bloomberg> InFlames: Man did you see my script?
[14:55:49] <Bloomberg> Why I cannot to move the sub level of menu jquery ?
[14:56:20] <Bloomberg> I use .ui-menu ul for move it, but I not get it!
[15:17:32] <Pnoexz> hey, i forgot which one was deprecated.. should i use on() or bind()?
[15:22:54] <shoky> Pnoexz: both are fine. on() is preferred and has more options
[15:23:02] <shoky> .bind() is a shortcut to .on()
[15:23:40] <Pnoexz> shoky: huh, i remember something related to events got deprecated, must have been something else.. thanks
[15:23:58] <shoky> Pnoexz: .live() was deprecated and removed
[15:24:15] <Pnoexz> yeah, that must be it
[15:24:26] <Pnoexz> i loved live()
[15:24:28] <sayd> Krinkle: thnks.. i didnt see a qunit task being run
[15:24:44] <shoky> live() was ugly
[15:24:55] <Pnoexz> why so?
[15:25:10] <shoky> because you used it like:  $('.myelement').live(...)
[15:25:45] <shoky> when doing $('.myelement')  it's supposed to find elements in the current DOM that match the selector, and return them in a jquery object
[15:25:58] <shoky> it doesn't do so with .live() as those elements don't exist yet
[15:26:13] <Pnoexz> i see
[15:26:23] <shoky> and it doesn't set any event handlers on any .myelement elements
[15:26:32] <shoky> even tho you're running a jquery method on $('.myelement')
[15:27:56] <shoky> and anyways it's straightforward to mimic .live with .on:  $(document).on('click', '.myelement', function...)
[15:28:24] <Pnoexz> oh, i didnt know that work around
[15:28:55] <shoky> that's what .live() really did
[15:35:29] <ryborg> I thought .live() differed in the way event bubbling was handled?
[15:42:54] <clime> duch_kazatel: really nice tip with that content scrolling plugin yesterday. Exactly what I needed. Thanks.
[15:49:28] <clime> anyone has an experience with pjax plugin? I want to return json data with it but it seems not to be supported :(.
[15:51:52] <clime> maybe if I would call $.pjax directly and pass success handler to it...
[15:52:11] <clime> as described here: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax#pjax-1
[15:54:01] <clime> ill try to figure that out but I am also interested if it is worth doing. I could also do two separate ajax requests. Is it something I should be concerned about? I mean 1 ajax request vs 2 ajax requests on one page? How bad are additional requests?
[16:08:04] <lucenut_> I am having trouble getting the jquery datepicker to work in FF and IE.
[16:08:21] <snover> i’m so sorry, that is a very sad trouble
[16:09:31] <lucenut_> The calendar appears but the date doesn't go into the textbox.
[16:09:36] <lucenut_> Chrome works fine.
[16:11:30] <lucenut_> 1.3.2 works, but 1.6.1 and 2.0.3 don't.
[16:12:14] <diverdude> hi Why is the option with focus not coloured or highlighted in some way when hovering the mouse or scrolling through options in the typeahead? http://jsbin.com/AfEpIWE/5/
[16:15:58] <clime> lucenut_: no errors in console?
[16:16:23] <lucenut_> Not really sure how to do that.
[16:17:17] <lucenut_> Tools > Web Developer > Web Console?
[16:19:41] <lucenut_> I used to like the old FF "Error Console". This thing shows all kinds of stuff. Not just js errors.
[16:21:49] <clime> lucenut_: you can set it up to show warnings etc. Anyway, visit the docs page and check the examples there. They should work. Take one and then apply it.
[16:22:11] <lucenut_> I went in the settings and unchecked everything but the "Console". And when I try the datepicker I don't see anything.
[16:22:35] <clime> lucenut_: or make a jsfiddle and show that it does not work there. Then we can actually help you.
[16:24:26] <talntid> whats the most efficient way you guys can do this? "Given a array of numbers, for each element give the product of every other number. eg 1 2 4 3--> 24 12 6 8"
[16:25:39] <clime> talntid: two nested for loops.
[16:26:58] <clime> talntid: oh, ok it can be done simpler. By first calculating the total product of all numbers and then another loop where you divide total product by current elem.
[16:27:09] <shoky> or.. var product = arr.reduce(function(a,b) { return a*b }), result = arr.map(function(num) { return product/num })
[16:27:15] <shoky> yah what clime said
[16:28:43] <shoky> js> var arr = [1,2,4,3], product = arr.reduce(function(a,b) { return a*b }), result = arr.map(function(num) { return product/num }); print(result);
[16:28:48] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[16:28:57] <shoky> ;S
[16:30:13] <clime> anyone experienced with jquery pjax plugin? I need to make it work with json responses...
[16:33:12] <lucenut_> http://jsfiddle.net/ isn't even working.
[16:33:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah jsfiddle is down right now.
[16:34:34] <pixelpimp> works fine for me
[16:35:33] <duch_kazatel> weird back up for me now, too.
[16:35:43] <clime> not working for me
[16:35:56] <clime> oh now it works
[16:36:07] <clime> loading times high tho
[16:52:16] <horacsio> hi
[16:53:32] <horacsio> is jsfiddle off?
[16:54:52] <duch_kazatel> it's having problems.
[16:59:05] <horacsio> ok can you help me with this: http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1149/d21q.png ? :)
[16:59:41] <horacsio> I need my order come from top to bottom, from right to left orientation
[17:00:27] <pixelpimp> didn't like the CSS solution?
[17:01:00] <horacsio> pixelpimp your solution was equal to mine!!! :( sorry
[17:01:17] <pixelpimp> oh? so why not use it?
[17:01:50] <horacsio> :) I would like to order it from top to bottom as I try to explain in my image
[17:02:45] <pixelpimp> it did....
[17:03:37] <horacsio> Im sorry but it didn't
[17:03:43] <pixelpimp> my solution fits your image precisely
[17:04:25] <horacsio> On the right column I have 3 lines, right? 1 5 9
[17:04:42] <horacsio> I want that to be 1 2 3 from top to bottom
[17:04:56] <horacsio> and second from the left 4 5 6
[17:05:03] <horacsio> and so on :)
[17:05:27] <pixelpimp> what browser are you using?
[17:06:08] <horacsio> FF
[17:06:22] <pixelpimp> well obviously it's not going to work with those -webkit lines
[17:06:37] <pixelpimp> use chrome or adjust the css
[17:07:14] <horacsio> hhhmmm ok...
[17:07:47] <pixelpimp> -moz is the mozilla prefix
[17:08:13] <jtal> horacsio are you using anything for layout?
[17:08:29] <horacsio> what you mean?
[17:08:43] <jtal> bootstrap, etc?
[17:09:57] <horacsio> no
[17:10:10] <horacsio> I'm using a theme from wordpress
[17:10:15] <horacsio> blankslate
[17:14:53] <horacsio> pixelpimp I've made the thing but is column-count safe?
[17:15:35] <pixelpimp> depends on what you mean by safe
[17:15:44] <pixelpimp> it's pretty new
[17:18:26] <horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/TRLTP/2/ why the column on the right is at the bottom?
[17:46:32] <clime> hey $.parseHTML(data [, context ] [, keepScripts ])  - what is context arg good for?
[17:47:28] <Ericx2x> hey guys can someone tell me why I can't get the "Download Brochure" text to change color on hover?
[17:47:28] <Ericx2x> http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com/
[17:47:29] <Ericx2x> I basically have this:
[17:47:29] <Ericx2x> .downloadbrochure:hover{
[17:47:29] <Ericx2x> 	color: yellow;
[17:47:29] <Ericx2x> }
[17:48:42] <shoky> Ericx2x: because "color" only applies to text
[17:48:56] <shoky> Ericx2x: but you're using cufon which shows a canvas instead
[17:49:15] <pixelpimp> Ericx2x: you're going to get the same answer in every channel
[17:49:19] <Ericx2x> shoky is there a way to change the color of a canvas element?
[17:49:37] <pixelpimp> sure, change the code to redraw it.  canvas doesn't work like that
[17:49:53] <pixelpimp> make cufon redraw it somehow
[17:50:50] <shoky> Ericx2x: what pixelpimp said. learn how to use cufon properly would be my 1st todo
[17:51:09] <Ericx2x> shoky i dont even know why cufon is used
[17:51:14] <Ericx2x> I was given this prject
[17:51:17] <pixelpimp> to get that fancy font
[17:51:25] <Ericx2x> you can't get that fancy font normally?
[17:52:12] <pixelpimp> you probably could with @font-face
[17:52:17] <pixelpimp> again, something i said in #css
[17:52:25] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[17:52:29] <Ericx2x> would this not solve my issue?
[17:52:29] <Ericx2x> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2727814/cufon-hover-change-of-font-syntax
[17:52:36] <pixelpimp> i don't know.  would it?
[17:53:58] <Ericx2x> it doesn't seem to
[17:55:13] <clime> Ericx2x: what about that hover option that is mentioned there? You need to init cufon separately for that "download brochure" thing and give it that option.
[18:13:10] <_dc_> hi all...is there a rate limit on google's cdn?
[18:15:15] <petey> is there anyway I can stop the children from closing on click? http://jsfiddle.net/jugal/LfYAK/
[18:15:23] <petey> I just want the parent to be expandable/collapsable
[18:21:31] <unnu> petey, quick google search came up with this http://jjis.me/a/209 perhaps it may help?
[18:22:59] <dwarder> in this paradigm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12274114/sequencing-function-calls-in-javascript-are-callbacks-the-only-way (selected answer) how would you send params from firstFunction to secondFunction , here is the jsfidle http://jsfiddle.net/zerkms/zJhph/

[18:23:24] <unnu> hope it helps :D
[18:31:06] <clime> hey I am trying to convert text with html into jquery object. This is what I have got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/uQeLV/ The problem is that there are many unwanted text nodes in the resulting object.
[18:33:05] <clime> How to get rid of them? or should i use some other method of doing that?
[18:33:22] <onesidezero> what are you trying to get rid of
[18:33:44] <clime> the unwanted text nodes
[18:33:59] <onesidezero> which are?
[18:34:41] <onesidezero> are we supposed to guess which ones are unwanted?
[18:35:33] <clime> it is quite easy to guess , they all contain whitespaces
[18:35:52] <onesidezero> i couldnt guess that
[18:35:55] <onesidezero> you said text nodes
[18:35:58] <onesidezero> not whitespace
[18:36:05] <clime> wtf?
[18:36:23] <onesidezero> you want to strip whitespace, or nodes?
[18:37:23] <unnu> clime, onesidezero has a point, it may seem obvious to you what you are doing because you have been working on it. also i assume onesidezero is just trying to help
[18:37:44] <unnu> :)
[18:38:19] <clime> ok i am sorry, i want to strip text nodes that contain only whitespaces.
[18:38:46] <onesidezero> i dont really see any that only contain whitespace, i just see whitespace occurring between tags
[18:38:51] <onesidezero> unless i am missing something
[18:39:27] <clime> onesidezero: did you look at the output in the console?
[18:39:33] <onesidezero> i did
[18:39:35] <onesidezero> and i am
[18:39:56] <onesidezero> you can see that your root has 5 items in the array, text, li.video, text, li.image and text
[18:40:56] <onesidezero> you could do it with simple javascript and a basic regex
[18:42:06] <unnu> im still confundeled on what clime is trying to do
[18:42:09] <unnu> off to smoke for me
[18:42:13] <onesidezero> :)
[18:42:17] <onesidezero> i think i understand
[18:42:24] <onesidezero> let me see if i can put it together for you
[18:57:26] <clime> onesidezero: thanks for trying to help, I have kinda solved it. It is much easier to do just $($.trim(text)) instead of what I was doing. The text nodes are still present but it is not a problem. (i thought it is but it was the way I was constructring the jquery object)
[18:58:35] <onesidezero> dont do that
[19:53:01] <unnu> #jquery, I am sick of jquery
[20:00:36] <d3m0n> Sup guys, back again still with same problem in hopes someone can help with animating the y-axis of background positon : http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/6/
[20:13:51] <adamsilver> So I have this: $(document).pjax('[data-pjax] a, a[data-pjax]', '#pjax-container'); to have any <a data-pjax href... passed to pjax. Is there a way to reverse this? I mean saying pass all to pjax except the ones marked with no-data-pjax?
[20:21:18] <unnu> d3m0n: you around?
[20:21:32] <d3m0n> unnu: Yep
[20:21:53] <unnu> PM whatcha want
[20:24:01] <zquad> $(window).width() give the entire browser width, how do I get just the canvas part of the browser height
[20:24:07] <TNG_25> hello
[20:24:26] <TNG_25> i need some help with jquery, may anyone here assistance me ?
[20:35:04] <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to use jquery dataTables plugin but some of my tables have data coming from a parent table that will need to be updated if the parent table row changes, I am not clear on the best way to implement that
[20:35:57] <lenswipee> xp_prg: what is the problem?
[20:37:55] <xp_prg> well lets say I have description in the parent table and also the child table in multiple rows that are the parent's description, I update the description in the parent table, how do I then automatically go and update all the child rows efficiently?
[20:38:59] <lenswipee> xp_prg: you know concept of relational databases?
[20:39:11] <tieTYT> hi
[20:39:29] <tieTYT> I'm writing a test, it's easy to tell an element to fire the click event by calling .click().  How can I do this for a starttouch event?
[20:40:18] <xp_prg> ya, but this is all in the browser
[20:40:31] <xp_prg> it doesn't go back to the database proper for a full refresh for speed reasons
[20:53:54] <zquad> am I invisible?
[20:56:46] <d3m0n> zquad: what do you mean by canvas part
[20:57:12] <zquad> how do I get the innerdimensions of the browser?
[20:57:27] <zquad> I tried $(window).width(); but then I get overflows
[20:58:03] <tieTYT> i figured it out.  You can do it with trigger
[20:59:03] <d3m0n> zquad: $(window).width returns the viewport, $(document).width will return the HTML doc
[20:59:26] <zquad> oh document, what is viewport/
[20:59:28] <zquad> ?
[20:59:48] <d3m0n> zquad: What you see on the browser window
[20:59:59] <zquad> aaaaah ok
[21:00:01] <zquad> let me try
[21:00:07] <d3m0n> zquad: eg: if you expand your browsers width, it increases the viewport
[21:02:35] <zquad> I have a div#id_here, I set $('#id_here').width( $(window).width() ) but a scrollbar appears because $id_here is wider that the viewport
[21:03:10] <d3m0n> zquad:  Do you have a testcase I can see
[21:04:55] <zquad> mmmmm no on the web
[21:08:32] <d3m0n> jsfiddle is sloowwww D:
[21:09:45] <nardev> d3m0n, i thought it's up to my connection :d
[21:10:22] <d3m0n> nardev:  haha yeah I think its been slow for like a week or something
[21:10:25] <nardev> hello, i want to add generic name to each radio within .question div. could you help http://jsfiddle.net/tudKk/
[21:11:02] <nardev> is there any good alternative to jsfiddlle
[21:11:24] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/ , http://tinkerbin.heroku.com/ , http://www.webdevout.net/test/
[21:11:36] <kborchers> nardev: jsbin.com
[21:11:51] <nardev> kborchers, thnx d3m0n too
[21:12:13] <d3m0n> zquad: http://jsfiddle.net/EQ8KJ/
[21:12:39] <nardev> d3m0n, could you help me about my issue?
[21:14:58] <d3m0n> nardev: I can try, I am better at CSS/HTML than jQuery tho :P
[21:15:07] <nardev> :) me too
[21:15:47] <nardev> i believe this one is trivial but i'm stuck how to select each under each
[21:15:52] <nardev> and than change something..
[21:16:14] <nardev> unfortunately this is not the best time to ask, not many people online
[21:16:56] <d3m0n> nardev:  You mean like .next()?
[21:17:24] <kborchers> nardev: what do you mean by generic name?
[21:18:12] <nardev> d3m0n, hmm.. if you understand me right, i want to add/set name attribute to each "group" for <input type="radio" /> and they are actually grouped by <div class="question"> div
[21:19:07] <nardev> kborchers, so that all <input type="radio" /> within <div class="question"> get same name for example  group1
[21:20:37] <nardev> anyone???
[21:20:39] <d3m0n> nardev: Do you have a test case? Not sure if you want to add the attribute to the div (group) or the input itseld but .find() also works well for doing something like that
[21:21:06] <nardev> d3m0n, this one http://jsfiddle.net/tudKk/
[21:21:35] <nardev> d3m0n, or in another place http://jsbin.com/ILoseva/2/edit
[21:21:48] <nardev> http://jsbin.com/ILoseva/2/edit?html,js,output d3m0n
[21:22:05] <kborchers> nardev: http://jsfiddle.net/tudKk/2/
[21:23:11] <nardev> kborchers, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
[21:23:11] <nardev> :D
[21:23:40] <nardev> kborchers, this is what i was looking for, ":radio", this
[21:23:49] <nardev> i didn't know that that is possible (":radio", this)
[21:24:31] <kborchers> nardev: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1
[21:24:34] <d3m0n> ^.^
[21:25:51] <nardev> kborchers, thank you
[21:25:55] <kborchers> np
[21:26:14] <nardev> and yes d3m0n as you said.. it's actualy find()
[21:26:15] <nardev> :D
[21:43:15] <floatingpoint> hey is it not possible to call innerHTML on a td?
[21:43:46] <relipse> lets say i have function foo(opts){ this.bar(opts){ //how do i access first opts ....
[21:44:02] <relipse>  lets say i have function foo(opts){ this.bar = function(opts){ //how do i access first opts ....
[21:52:51] <relipse> what is the latest coolest way to disable a <button>
[22:07:26] <relipse> what is the unexpected identifier in this line: var card = new CCGCard({"import_card_from_li":this});
[22:07:52] <nardev> jquery really amazing :D $(":radio", this).attr("name", "group" + index++).each(function(index,value){ $(this).attr("id","id"+groupNumber+index).next("label").attr("for","id"+groupNumber+index);
[22:07:52] <nardev>         });
[22:08:01] <nardev> man... this chaining is so GREAT :D
[22:08:38] <relipse> for clarity nardev, it is good to put on separate lines
[22:08:52] <relipse> .attr()
[22:08:57] <relipse> .next(...)
[22:08:59] <relipse> etc
[22:09:15] <nardev> relipse, :D i know but they didn't pay me to do it that good :d
[22:10:27] <relipse> that implies that doing it is not an enjoyable effort
[22:10:44] <relipse> oh well
[22:10:45] <nardev> relipse, well, it's exactly as it should be :D
[22:25:50] <Mrgoose> Do you all still experience transition flicker in jquery mobile 1.4 beta?
[22:28:28] <relipse> Can you test ajax locally or do you have to have a webserver installed? ie. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[22:31:24] <nardev> relipse, make local json or whatever response you expect
[22:31:26] <nardev> and test it...
[22:31:33] <nardev> like fetching from a file...
[22:31:39] <relipse> --allow-file-access-from-files works, but..
[22:31:44] <nardev> of.. just write an object..
[22:31:58] <relipse> what you mean?
[22:42:42] <nardev> how can i easily check if EACH <div class="sth"> contains <div class="sthElse"> which contains at least two <div class="xy"> ?
[22:52:16] <nardev> is it possible to nest .hes
[22:52:20] <nardev> is it possible to nest .has
[22:55:38] <devphp> Hello
[22:56:32] <devphp> Can someone help me, if possible in French. thank you
[23:03:12] <rmah> anyone around?
[23:12:52] <Cork> nardev: what do you mean by nest?
[23:13:11] <Cork> you can run .has().has() if that is what you mean
[23:13:29] <nardev> Cork, it was related to my previous question
[23:13:32] <nardev> how can i easily check if EACH <div class="sth"> contains <div class="sthElse"> which contains at least two <div class="xy"> ?
[23:14:01] <Cork> you want a list where that is true or?
[23:14:06] <nardev> i want to chech if $(element).has(element).has(whichHasAnotherOne)
[23:14:20] <Cork> it doesn't really work like that no
[23:14:27] <nardev> Cork, no, just to check if all html structure is ok
[23:16:15] <nardev> Cork, how to break .each() function once it doesn't satisfies
[23:16:28] <Cork> if($(element).filter(function() { var self = $(this); return self.find('.sthElse').length == 1 && self.find('.sthElse .xy').length == 2; }).length > 0) { /* error */ } else { /* a ok */ }
[23:17:10] <nardev> Cork, thank you very much
[23:17:12] <nardev> :D
[23:23:47] <unnu> whats with $(...).dialog is not a function error?
[23:24:10] <Cork> unnu: you need to load jquery-ui
[23:24:25] <unnu> jsfiddle is being screwy cork
[23:24:30] <unnu> also, whazup cork :D
[23:24:49] <Cork> nothing much, same old
[23:25:12] <unnu> is there a certian copy of jquery i should select in jsfiddle?
[23:25:27] <Cork> you have a link to the fiddle?
[23:25:41] <Cork> 1.10 should have an jquery-ui checkbox
[23:25:48] <unnu> alright
[23:26:02] <unnu> http://www.jsfiddle.net/gJ68z/4/
[23:26:11] <unnu> ITS SO SLOW
[23:26:12] <unnu> :(
[23:26:22] <Cork> ya jsfiddle is that some times
[23:27:52] <unnu> Totes isn't giving me a UI option
[23:27:58] <Cork> hmm
[23:28:05] <Cork> ?down www.jsfiddle.net
[23:28:31] <Cork> <_<
[23:28:31] <nardev> Cork, jsfiddle so so so so slow
[23:28:42] * Cork pokes b-ot
[23:28:46] <unnu> all night
[23:29:14] <unnu> b-ot is a bot
[23:29:15] <unnu> go figure
[23:29:16] <Cork> might be worth trying jsbin instead
[23:29:16] <unnu> lol
[23:29:27] <Cork> :)
[23:29:36] <unnu> never tried jsbin
[23:30:13] <Cork> ?g jsbin
[23:30:13] <b-ot> Cork: JS Bin - Collaborative JavaScript Debugging → http://jsbin.com/
[23:30:26] <Cork> jsfiddle is nicer when it works
[23:30:31] <Cork> but jsbin is ok
[23:30:47] <Cork> www.webdevout.net/test is another ok one
[23:31:08] <b-ot> Cork: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://www.jsfiddle.net is down! (ECONNRESET)
[23:31:23] <Cork> yikes...
[23:31:28] <Cork> SLOOOW
[23:31:45] <unnu> lol
[23:31:48] <unnu> <3 my php bot
[23:32:24] <unnu> SAME ERROR CORK
[23:32:27] <unnu> DAMN GODIT
[23:32:32] <Cork> ?
[23:32:47] <unnu> http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/1/edit
[23:33:30] <nardev> Cork, :*( unfortunately the code you wrote me doesn't work, i'm gonna jsbin it to who you
[23:34:25] <Cork> unnu: http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/2/edit
[23:36:19] <nardev> Cork, http://jsbin.com/eyUBOKU/1/edit
[23:36:20] <nardev> :(
[23:36:51] <zquad> I have a problem: $(window).innerWidth(); = 1600 when the document loads but when I run $(window).innerWidth() on the console = 1578, why would that be?
[23:38:10] <nardev> zquad, counts sidebar or so?
[23:38:25] <zquad> hmmm I just thought that also
[23:38:32] <zquad> thanks
[23:40:04] <Cork> nardev: http://jsbin.com/eyUBOKU/3/edit
[23:40:34] <Cork> zquad: that looks like the scrollbar
[23:40:48] <Cork> scrollbars is normally 12-13 px
[23:41:17] <Mylen> This probably means nothing out of context, but this script replaces thumbnails on an imageboard with the scaled down full image. Is there any way to restrict this to just .gif images and not include .png/.jpg? Because i'm stuck. http://jsbin.com/uNOZAtoP
[23:41:49] <zquad> Cork in this case 22 px
[23:42:20] <Cork> zquad: not sure, is it browser specific?
[23:42:36] <zquad> one sec let me play around with this
[23:44:07] <unnu> http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/5/edit    totes not working
[23:44:14] <unnu> i want the dialog to open when i click the image
[23:44:31] <unnu> im new to jquery UI and all, but why does it hate me so much?
[23:46:39] <nardev> Cork, :( it doesn't :( http://jsbin.com/eyUBOKU/4/edit thank you anyway :(.. i see the logic but i have no idea why it doesn't want to pass
[23:47:42] <Cork> unnu: well fix the selector and it works :) http://jsbin.com/IfAZUYE/6/edit
[23:48:29] <Cork> nardev: the first check means there can be no .question element in it
[23:48:30] <unnu> MAYBE I DONT BELIEVE IN THE HASH SYMBOL CORK!
[23:48:33] <unnu> lol
[23:48:36] <unnu> thanks man
[23:48:37] <Cork> :)
[23:48:37] <unnu> its late
[23:49:30] <Cork> nardev: the check is if there is not the set number of .question elements in there
[23:49:40] <nardev> Cork, mmm it should check   1. if there is .box   2. if there is one or more .question in .box    3. if there is 2 or more :radio elements in .question
[23:50:07] <Cork> "is more questions"
[23:50:16] <Cork> as in if there is any at all?
[23:50:32] <zquad> it was the scrollbar smh
[23:50:36] <zquad> that took too long
[23:50:38] <nardev> Cork, yes..
[23:50:50] <nardev> there must be at least one .question
[23:51:07] <Cork> nardev: and the radio part is that per question or in box total?
[23:51:45] <nardev> :radio is in .question and must be at least 2 radios
[23:51:54] <unnu> Hey cork, that JS, How hard would it be to do something like .selectable() on it?
[23:51:59] <unnu> is that even possible with an image?
[23:52:04] <Cork> ya but is it of interest if you have two question and one radio in each?
[23:52:17] <Cork> unnu: sure
[23:52:33] <unnu> trying to make an easy to use CMS still
[23:52:46] <Cork> unnu: you might want to add a wrapping element for so you don't use selectable on the dialog element
[23:52:56] <nardev> Cork, no.. in each .question there must be 2 or more :radio to be valid
[23:52:58] <unnu> mmmhmm
[23:53:08] <unnu> english?
[23:53:12] <Cork> nardev: ugg that complicates things alot
[23:53:21] <Cork> unnu: add an extra div around the images or similar
[23:53:27] <unnu> GOTCHA!
[23:53:28] <Cork> unnu: and then run sortable on that
[23:53:39] <Cork> *selectable
[23:54:13] <nardev> could you look at this, i tried this way but i don't know how to break .each it doesn't stop on return false http://paste.debian.net/61480/
[23:54:29] <nardev> Cork,
[23:54:57] <unnu> hrmmm
[23:55:01] <unnu> didn't seem to work
[23:55:05] <unnu> ill keep at it
[23:58:02] <unnu> ugh
[23:58:03] <unnu> cork
[23:58:11] <unnu> i dont think images are .selectable()
[23:58:52] <Cork> nardev: http://jsbin.com/eyUBOKU/5/edit
[23:59:31] <nardev> Cork, thank you very very much :(
[23:59:42] <nardev> unfortunately we
[23:59:56] <nardev> don't understand eachother
