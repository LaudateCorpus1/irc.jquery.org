[00:03:39] <thinkxl> I got this code: http://pastebin.com/RnqvVLX3 where I want to get lat or lng when I do this: getLatLng.lat
[00:04:00] <thinkxl> but it returns undefined, but the console that I have inside the callback function it returns me the data
[00:04:33] <thinkxl> I mean getLatLang.lat("address string");
[00:29:52] <Snoopal> hey guys. a client of mine wants that every link which refeers to another website has to trigger a javascript alert message. any hint how i could create that ?
[00:50:27] <thinkxl> Snoopal: $('a[href]').on('click', function() { alert('msg'); });
[00:51:06] <Snoopal> thinkxl: so this triggers when href is to another website?
[00:51:15] <thinkxl> ooo to another website
[00:51:19] <thinkxl> sorry sorry
[00:51:31] <thinkxl> let me see 1 second
[00:51:38] <Snoopal> take your time! :)
[00:52:59] <thinkxl> what about the onbeforeunload event
[00:53:27] <thinkxl> it triggers when user try to leave the page
[00:53:33] <Snoopal> not sure that i am able to check if user goes to another site
[00:53:43] <Snoopal> or just wants to close tab/browser
[00:53:52] <thinkxl> yep you are right
[00:54:35] <thinkxl> all your internal links
[00:54:42] <thinkxl> are with href="/" right?
[00:54:48] <thinkxl> like "/about" and that?
[00:55:29] <Snoopal> let me check mom
[00:55:58] <Snoopal> no they have full url
[00:56:32] <thinkxl> well you can place a conditional to see if document.location.href is in the link inside href
[00:56:48] <thinkxl> if not, trigger the alert
[00:57:18] <Snoopal> hmmm
[00:58:00] <Snoopal> i ll give that a try. thanks!
[01:00:48] <thinkxl> http://pastebin.com/jqqAcGhJ
[01:00:50] <thinkxl> something like this
[01:00:58] <thinkxl> not tested just typed the idea
[01:05:07] <Snoopal> thinkxl: this triggers on every link
[01:05:14] <Snoopal> also internal links
[01:05:24] <thinkxl> can you show me an internal link please
[01:05:29] <thinkxl> I didn't tested it
[01:06:59] <Snoopal> e.g. http://xx.xx.xx.com/top-news/blabla-foo-bar/
[01:07:20] <thinkxl> ok
[01:07:22] <thinkxl> let me see
[01:20:29] <thinkxl> sorry, had to change fo computer
[01:21:39] <Snoopal> hehe
[01:21:44] <Snoopal> no problem :D
[01:23:14] <thinkxl> so
[01:23:32] <thinkxl> you know what indeOf is for?
[01:23:35] <thinkxl> sorry for my poor englihs
[01:26:39] <Snoopal> i know what indexof does yes
[01:27:30] <Snoopal> i found out that document.domain gives me the domain. the question is now how to compare with href
[01:30:12] <Snoopal> ok i got it :)
[01:30:20] <tw2113> window.location ?
[01:30:31] <Snoopal> i used indexOf(document.domain)
[01:30:44] <Snoopal> and it works just fine
[01:31:47] <Snoopal> thank you for your support thinkxl ! :)
[01:37:20] <thinkxl> http://jsbin.com/ataMAME/1/
[01:37:26] <thinkxl> try this
[01:37:27] <thinkxl> cool
[01:58:32] <HowardwLo> hello! https://dpaste.de/aTwN i'm trying to make a button clickable only once and avoid any problems by setting a delay of 5 seconds to reopen the button again (incase user disconnects or something crazy). Trouble is, setTimeout hangs the browser. is there another option?
[02:04:20] <HowardwLo> is there a way to use setTimeout but not have it hang browser?
[02:04:27] <HowardwLo> https://dpaste.de/aTwN
[02:08:39] <Snoopal> HowardwLo: try to use setIntervall to do your action. and stop the intervall after it was called once

[04:47:23] <Deele> hello
[04:47:59] <Deele> what exactly is 'this' inside callback function for $.getJSON
[06:57:09] <JeffC_> Hi there, I'm having problem with my javascript here --> http://jsbin.com/aVUxiNoc/1/
[06:57:30] <JeffC_> I need the display to show effect but somehow is not working
[07:00:27] <vinky> JeffC_, I dont see the problem
[07:01:50] <JeffC_> vinky, I think my code got problem, the logic I set there is if the field all empty, it will animate out the error message and return false if field all enter then it proceed
[07:07:58] <vipconsult> you know sometimes the inout field shows you values that you have used before . in a list below the input field. what is the event when I select one of these values ?
[07:09:46] <vipconsult> I tried .change but that seems only for dropdown form elements.
[07:10:34] <grafi> interesting question
[07:11:19] <vipconsult> the api states that input is also supported. but not working at my side.
[07:12:26] <grafi> for change?
[07:13:25] <vipconsult> ah change works but only when you rmeove the focus form the field
[07:13:39] <grafi> jup
[07:14:23] <vipconsult> so back to the original task , how do I trigger a function when on of those prepopulated values is selected.
[07:15:48] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:17:05] <grafi> according to google there is no standard way of doing that vipconsult
[07:17:31] <vipconsult> grafi ok
[07:18:43] <Lope> I'm having issues reading the value from a select element. $('#myselect').val() is giving me the inner text, not the value. of the selected option element. ?
[07:20:02] <jphase> hi
[07:20:34] <jphase> vipconsult: hmm, .change *should* work for other elements as well whenever the value of the input/select/whatever changes. Is it not firing on text inputs?
[07:21:04] <vipconsult> it is , but only when you rmeove the focus form that input field.
[07:21:29] <jphase> oic interesting
[07:21:32] <vipconsult> I want o trigger an event as soon as the input value changes
[07:22:10] <vipconsult> i tried mouseup as well , but it doesn;t work for the prepopulated list
[07:22:27] <Lope> oh, my option element values are getting messed up.
[07:22:51] <jphase> yeah, those are probably only triggered on focus then, I've never really had to do what you're doing :\
[07:23:22] <Siecje> I'm trying to limit a select field to only go up to the selection of another select field https://dpaste.de/tQpg
[07:26:12] <vipconsult> jphase I am taking the value form input field 1 split the text and put the first half in field 2 and second in field 3 . the keyup event works fine , but not when you select prepoluated field form values you have entered before.
[07:27:34] <JeffC_> anyone mind to help me as per my earlier question?
[07:29:03] <jphase> JeffC_: I'm confused what the problem is, it seems to validate correctly for me.
[07:30:13] <jphase> JeffC_: is the issue with your desire to animate?
[07:30:34] <jphase> side note:  there's no jQuery here and this is #jQuery :P
[07:31:52] <JeffC_> jphase, the one I have is javascript, but is it possible to change it to jquery?
[07:32:10] <jphase> JeffC_: of course! :)
[07:33:08] <JeffC_> jphase, my logic is to check if 3 field is empty then it will animate the error message and return false for the submit button, if all field is enter then proceed
[07:33:53] <JeffC_> i'm totally new in jquery may I know any guideline or tutorial I can learn as per my logic? jphase
[07:34:41] <jphase> JeffC_: there's plenty of resources you can google for "learning jquery" but I'll show you how this would look real quick
[07:36:43] <jphase> JeffC_: http://jsbin.com/aVUxiNoc/3/
[07:36:48] <jphase> something like that for starters
[07:37:12] <jphase> also, I'd recommend using <label> elements instead of <span> tags with a class of "label", that's what they're for ;)
[07:39:39] <JeffC_> jphase, thanks for the amend! now I'll try to work out the animation
[07:39:56] <jphase> JeffC_: to animate simply you can just change .show() to .fadeIn()
[07:40:20] <jphase> if you want something fancier then you'll probably have to modify your css and use a .animate() call
[07:41:15] <JeffC_> jphase, is it possible to fadeOut after like 10 sec?
[07:41:54] <Velveeta> you can set a timeout, and fade in your callback function
[07:41:55] <jphase> JeffC_: yeah, you could use .delay I suppose
[07:42:14] <JeffC_> means change .fadeIn to .delay?
[07:42:26] <jphase> no you chain them
[07:42:38] <JeffC_> woots, now I'm lost haha
[07:42:43] <jphase> JeffC_: something like .fadeIn().delay(1000).fadeOut();
[07:43:06] <JeffC_> oh
[07:43:07] <jphase> that's not my preferred way of fading things in and out with delays in between but it's good for beginners ;)
[07:43:48] <JeffC_> no worries, I'll learn and improve
[07:43:52] <JeffC_> thanks jphase
[07:43:57] <jphase> np
[07:44:04] <JeffC_> oh last question
[07:44:19] <JeffC_> instead of putting the script at buttom the form, can i put before the head tag?
[07:44:54] <jphase> JeffC_: you *can* put the script anywhere you want really, but I'd recommend putting it before your </body> tag
[07:45:40] <JeffC_> oh, so the script will be last to load right? :)
[07:45:45] <Velveeta> also, "before the head tag" i'm pretty sure is invalid markup, if you meant like <html><script></script><head>
[07:46:27] <jphase> yeah, I was hoping that was just lost in translation heh
[07:46:40] <Velveeta> right :)
[07:46:42] <jphase> hi Velveeta!
[07:46:43] <jphase> :D
[07:47:09] * Velveeta smashes his face into a cake, then pops up and says "HELLOOOOOOOO!"
[07:47:15] <jphase> lol
[07:47:44] <JeffC_> lol, sorry I'm a pure beginner in web development
[07:47:49] <JeffC_> sorry for my error :)
[07:48:09] <Velveeta> reference for you whippersnappers out there: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFeaK5UJ8O4
[07:48:33] <Velveeta> jeffc_: no need to apologize, we all started out new at one point
[07:48:54] <jphase> oh I wish I was young enough to not know movies like that :\
[07:49:05] <JeffC_> Velveeta, thanks mate!
[07:49:23] <Velveeta> :D
[07:54:14] <JeffC_> jphase, i have a problem the code work fine in jsbin but in my local file it doesn't work
[07:54:48] <jphase> JeffC_: paste your code into hastebin.com as you see it locally
[07:55:08] <jphase> p.s. are there any errors in your console?
[07:55:55] <jphase> oh.... also.. you probably need to include jQuery ;)
[07:55:55] <JeffC_> jjphase, sort it out.... my jquery code error lol
[07:56:11] <JeffC_> yeah I got the wrong one thats why it's not working haha
[07:56:25] <jphase> oh gotcha
[08:08:00] <jphase> Is anyone else able to write recursive functions while listening to music with lyrics in it? I find it quite distracting for some reason :\
[08:12:55] <grafi> goes for any kind of programming jphase
[08:12:56] <grafi> :P
[08:13:58] <jphase> well I'm okay listening to jazz standards and such when I'm writing other things, but the whole think 12 steps ahead thing messes with me enough to not be able to listen to music with lyrics I guess
[08:14:15] <jphase> </rant>
[08:16:45] <grafi> you poor soul
[08:16:45] <grafi> :P
[08:17:06] <jphase> I know, it's a really tough life...
[08:17:25] <grafi> it is
[08:17:42] <jphase> definitely a "1st world" problem heh
[08:18:12] <jphase> some ppl don't have food or medical aid and I have issues with jazz music while programming...
[08:19:48] <Uhkis> haha
[08:20:31] <grafi> well
[08:24:19] <Siecje> I'm trying to limit a select field to only go up to the selection of another select field https://dpaste.de/tQpg
[08:26:00] <jphase> Siecje: you'll probably want that to change to clear out all the options and rebuild rather than append
[08:35:20] <Velveeta> i've never heard of anything like that for recursive functions… i used to be not so strong at recursion, and so i just wrote a lot of it to make myself improve :D
[08:38:49] <Siecje> jphase: I thought about that but there are no duplicates, how do I clear all options?
[08:39:28] <jphase> Siecje: $(this).empty() or $(this).children().remove() probably
[08:39:36] <jphase> I lost your pastebing :\
[08:39:39] <jphase> -g
[08:40:14] <jphase> Siecje: it looked like if you changed multiple times it'd add dupes from what I remember
[08:42:01] <bahamas> hello. I have a lot of code inline that is under $(document).ready(). if I move it to an external file, should I still put it in $(document).ready()?
[08:42:41] <jphase> bahamas: yes
[08:42:55] <jphase> didn't know you could have doc ready "inline" though o_o
[08:43:19] <Velveeta> i'm guessing he means in an embedded script tag in the markup or something?
[08:45:03] <bahamas> Velveeta: sorry, that's what I meant
[08:45:18] <bahamas> I thought that's what it means to have js inline
[08:45:21] <Velveeta> so yeah, you should be able to rip all of that out and put it into an external file as-is
[08:45:30] <bahamas> in the html as opposed to in a file
[08:45:34] <Velveeta> inline is more like <div onclick="someFunction()">
[08:45:41] <bahamas> aha
[08:45:50] <Velveeta> similar to inline styles vs css
[08:45:59] <bahamas> yeah, that makes sense
[08:49:39] <bahamas> thank you both
[08:49:57] * jphase jumping highfive!
[08:52:20] <Velveeta> go team venture! http://i.imgur.com/iqd7Qrj.jpg
[08:52:42] <jphase> lol, you and your links       <3
[08:54:32] <Velveeta> :D
[08:57:51] <rodney77> Hello, I followed the tutorial here, to integrate an ajax form into a cms I'm using:  http://www.rolftjassens.com/blog/formbuilder-form-in-a-fancybox-modal-view
[08:58:18] <Siecje> the .change method does not seem to be triggered
[08:58:57] <Velveeta> siecje: do you have a fiddle example?
[08:59:05] <rodney77> however, the form appears to get submitted twice. The results are emailed twice when I submit, and so is the 'thank you' confirmation of receipt. When I submit normally, without ajax, this doesn't happen. This makes me think it's a problem with the js
[09:00:08] <jphase> rodney77: yeah it looks like prepareForm() is called twice in there
[09:00:09] <Velveeta> rodney77: did you do a preventDefault on the submit event?
[09:00:53] <Siecje> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/19/
[09:01:01] <rodney77> Thanks so much for the quick replies. Velveeta, preventDefault is the first line of the function:   $('.frm_ajax_inner form.cms_form').on( "submit", function( event ) {
[09:01:02] <rodney77>     event.preventDefault();
[09:01:17] <jphase> oh perhaps not, weird line breaks or lack there of there :\  I do see it twice but one is onClosed and one is in doc ready
[09:01:26] <rodney77> jphase, which one do you think should go? I tried commenting one out but got the same problem
[09:01:37] <jphase> rodney77: try removing the bottom prepareForm(); perhaps
[09:01:55] <jphase> inside the .post
[09:02:32] <jphase> I'm confused why that's called like 3 times in there really
[09:03:45] <jphase> that just binds the submit event to the form so it really only needs to be called once at the bottom of doc ready I'd think but I'm not totally certain, Velveeta > jphase so he could confirm
[09:04:23] <rodney77> odd
[09:04:27] <jphase> oh, that shouldn't resubmit the form though, so idk
[09:04:45] <jphase> I mean still unnecessary to have them since you only need to bind the submit event once but that shouldn't really resubmit the form
[09:04:47] <rodney77> thanks, jphase, but removing this didn't fix the problem
[09:04:49] <Velveeta> siecje: int() is not a function, or at least isn't defined in this code example
[09:05:03] <rodney77> yeah, it seems like it works fine without the redundant call
[09:05:25] <jphase> oh yeah, I see why they did that, don't listen to me rodney77 lol
[09:05:37] <Velveeta> if that function is what's binding the submit event, then calling it more than once would bind that listener more than once, in which case it would fire more than once
[09:05:46] <Velveeta> let me take a closer look at that post
[09:06:01] <rodney77> ok. it looks like it's calling this function prepareForm()
[09:06:24] <jphase> try removing the one in onClosed
[09:06:29] <rodney77> ok
[09:06:44] <Velveeta> yeah i'm w/ jphase
[09:07:09] <Velveeta> the form auto-resets itself within its own submit handler, so there's no reason to add another call to reset it within the fancybox's close
[09:07:32] <jphase> this is sloppy js for a tutorial :x
[09:07:53] <rodney77> heh
[09:08:17] <rodney77> I can take out all instances of prepareForm() except the very last one, the form still submits, and it still submits twice
[09:08:32] <rodney77> If I take out the last one, the form only submits once but it's not ajax anymore
[09:09:07] <Siecje> thank you Velveeta
[09:09:35] <Velveeta> siecje: no problem, i can't say if that's the only error, but it's preventing the code from continuing at that point
[09:09:49] <Velveeta> i think what you might be wanting is the Number() constructor instead of int, or else parseInt()
[09:10:16] <Velveeta> if you use parseInt(), make sure to pass the 2nd parameter (radix) as 10, it can bite you in the ass if the number string starts with a 0 or something, like "0400"
[09:14:32] <Siecje> yeah I used parseInt and it is now working
[09:16:40] <jphase> rodney77: put the prepareForm() functions back in and console.log(linktargetparent.html());  to see if you get output. It's possible the HTML it's trying to set is not being set and then the event is being bound twice rather than bound once to new HTML
[09:18:42] <rodney77> jphase, ok
[09:18:46] <jphase> rodney77: oh sorry, put that console.log inside onClosed before prepareForm()
[09:19:09] <rodney77> jphase, where should i put console.log(linktargetparent.html());
[09:19:16] <rodney77> ok
[09:19:25] <jphase> well... honestly it needs to have HTML in both spots, before it calls prepareForm();
[09:20:12] <jphase> so console.log(data) in the .post and console.log(linktargetparent.html()) in onClosed
[09:21:03] <jphase> if they both return HTML then something else is awry
[09:21:54] <rodney77> ok
[09:23:07] <rodney77> ok, jphase, when i just put in the first console.log you said, my console didn't output anything
[09:23:21] <rodney77> when i added the second line, it output <br />
[09:23:21] <rodney77>  <h3>Thank you</h3>
[09:23:21] <rodney77>  <br />
[09:23:21] <rodney77>  <p class="big">We will call you as soon as possible on number<br />
[09:23:21] <rodney77>  <strong>4444444444</strong></p>
[09:23:26] <rodney77> sorry for the flood
[09:23:35] <rodney77> this is the correct output btw
[09:23:44] <jphase> rodney77: then you're not getting a response from the server on post it sounds like
[09:24:16] <rodney77> I'm not? What does that mean? It's sending the fomr
[09:24:18] <rodney77> form
[09:24:38] <jphase> rodney77: check your network tab for a response from the server, it *should* contain the HTML of the form according to this jQuery this dude wrote
[09:25:04] <jphase> he's resetting the html of the form and rebinding the event, so if you have no response, you're just adding on event listeners, hence the double/triple/etc. submits
[09:26:19] <rodney77> hmm
[09:26:29] <rodney77> ok jphase, well i didn't see anything in the network tab
[09:26:49] <rodney77> I think what you said about event listeners sounds right
[09:26:52] <jphase> rodney77: what's your post URL?
[09:27:02] <rodney77> you want to see the form in action?
[09:27:09] <rodney77> http://hcbrgroup.com/
[09:27:09] <jphase> yes pls
[09:27:25] <jphase> request call btn?
[09:27:29] <rodney77> right on that front banner. it says 'request a call'
[09:27:32] <rodney77> yea
[09:27:33] <jphase> k
[09:27:53] <jphase> btw, make this autocomplete="on" hehe
[09:31:24] <jphase> rodney77: the problem is that the response from the server is the entire home page of your site rather than just the form
[09:31:32] <jphase> ?showtemplate=false is not uh... working
[09:31:33] <b-ot> jphase: memorised “showtemplate=false”.
[09:31:42] <jphase> ?
[09:32:06] <jphase> ?eval(showtemplate);
[09:32:12] <jphase> ?alert(showtemplate);
[09:32:14] <dblosevn> jphase: you told the bot to remember theat showtemplate = false lol
[09:32:23] <rodney77> jphase, are you sure? I think it is returning just the thank you message
[09:32:24] <jphase> whoops
[09:32:27] <dblosevn> ?showtemplate
[09:32:39] <dblosevn> ?echo showtemplate
[09:32:57] <jphase> oh, I'm wrong, it's not the whole homepage
[09:33:04] <rodney77> i was tinkering with the script for a while, and for a while it was returning the whole page in that little modal box
[09:33:05] <dblosevn> cant remember how to tell the bot to remember lol
[09:33:16] <jphase> but it does have some other markup in there with a function
[09:33:19] <jphase> hmm
[09:33:45] <jphase> nvm, hmm
[09:34:02] <dblosevn> ya response looked good to me
[09:34:29] <jphase> yeah only one post for me
[09:34:36] <dblosevn> me too
[09:34:58] <dblosevn> I didnt enter an email though so it got kicked back for that but I saw the updated form
[09:35:10] <dblosevn> with val errors etc
[09:35:30] <jphase> yeah, it actually works great rodney77, validated and not
[09:35:41] <jphase> only getting one post in my network tab as well
[09:35:46] <rodney77> hmmmmm
[09:35:50] <dblosevn> Tested on chrome though, rodney77: what browser are you seeing the issue on?\
[09:35:58] * jphase seconds dblosevn
[09:36:12] <rodney77> all browsers, dblosevn
[09:36:21] <rodney77> the form seems to work great
[09:36:34] <rodney77> but if you put your real email address in there, you will get two thank yous
[09:36:41] <dblosevn> oh
[09:36:43] <jphase> oh
[09:36:45] <dblosevn> didnt test that
[09:36:45] <jphase> that's server-side then
[09:36:56] <jphase> only 1 post is going through
[09:38:23] <dblosevn> I didnt get that behavior, one post, one response
[09:38:34] <dblosevn> chrome-latest
[09:38:49] <jphase> same
[09:39:07] <jphase> oh wait, no I have 2
[09:39:26] <rodney77> really
[09:39:28] <jphase> they look different too, one has a line return before "Sales Department"
[09:39:34] <rodney77> yeah
[09:39:41] <rodney77> one email will come back plain text and one html
[09:39:44] <rodney77> how weird is that
[09:40:10] <jphase> yeah, this sounds like an issue with Form Builder or something on the server-side since only one post is going through on the network tab
[09:41:00] <dblosevn> oh, your getting 2 emails
[09:41:06] <dblosevn> not 2 thank you pages
[09:41:12] <jphase> yeah, I got 2 emails
[09:41:14] <dblosevn> *thank you responses
[09:41:29] <dblosevn> thats definitely somehting server sided
[09:41:40] <dblosevn> nothing to do with the client side code
[09:42:35] <dblosevn> possibly its trying to send a dual encoded email and messingup?
[09:43:11] <dblosevn> Don't quite know how to mess up bad enough to send 2 emails, but not bad enough to fail to send either of them
[09:43:19] <jphase> yeah the problem is definitely what you said before though rodney77, the second message is a plaintext version. PHPMailer is sending both the "multipart/alternative" and
[09:43:27] <jphase> "text/plain" emails separately
[09:43:32] <rodney77> ahhok
[09:43:34] <jphase> (accidental enter key)
[09:46:09] <rodney77> well, jphase, when i take out the jquery and submit normally, i only get one email
[09:47:03] <dblosevn> rodney77: in that case dump the post vars on the server when submitting normally, and submit the same values via ajax and dump them
[09:47:19] <dblosevn> rodney77: then compare the 2 to see whats different
[09:47:55] <dblosevn> rodney77: most likely jquery/js is encoding something differently in its post then your seeing on a normal submition
[09:48:28] <dblosevn> just put var_dump($_POST);exit; at the top of your controller and post to it normally and with ajax
[09:49:01] <dblosevn> id almost be willing to bet the posts look different in some way
[09:49:12] <rodney77> hmm
[09:50:14] <rodney77> ok, dblosevn, I know know what the contoller is. I'm using this cms called cms made simple, which I've never used before
[09:50:30] <rodney77> Are you saying to find the file that processes the form and add a line to it?
[09:51:08] <dblosevn> ya, where ever the code is that processes that form add that to the top, or...
[09:51:20] <rodney77> maybe I could just tell the cms to only send plain text emails
[09:51:24] <dblosevn> just change the action of the form to a simple php file with just that line
[09:52:02] <dblosevn> <?php var_dump($_POST);exit; ?>
[09:52:15] <dblosevn> thats probally the easiest solution
[10:05:51] <rodney77> ok, dblosevn, i'm back
[10:05:55] <rodney77> ["cntnt01fbrp_submit"]=> string(1) " "
[10:06:10] <rodney77> this is at the end of the string when i submit normally (non-ajax)
[10:06:19] <rodney77> this is missing in the ajax submission
[10:07:31] <jphase> rodney77: that's normal, the AJAX post probably doesn't need that
[10:08:06] <jphase> I mean, perhaps it does? In which case you could add submit button in your form builder form with the same name
[10:08:28] <rodney77> well the submit button should be there
[10:08:38] <rodney77> i didn't remove any marked up buttons
[10:09:03] <rodney77> are you saying I should add that to the post url somehow?
[10:09:35] <jphase> not the post URL no, it does look like it's in the response from the server though in the form so that *should* be included in the .serialize
[10:09:53] <jphase> http://hastebin.com/wabumovice.xml  that's the response I'm getting from the server when I submit the form
[10:10:24] <jphase> I see that submit button in there, so the next time it submits it should have it in there in the .serialize(), but I doubt that's the problem
[10:10:37] <jphase> is the email being handled by that form builder thing?
[10:11:15] <rodney77> i think so
[10:11:29] <jphase> rodney77: I'd just write your own script for the email personally
[10:11:50] <jphase> otherwise you'll have to debug the problem with how that plugin is handling it
[10:12:51] <jphase> then you'll either need to rewrite the form and jQuery or include the same form in the response from the server when it's not valid
[10:13:37] <rodney77> frustrating
[10:13:51] <rodney77> I don't time to write the script myself
[10:13:57] <jphase> indeed. is there some sort of settings page somewhere to disable the plaintext or html email?
[10:13:57] <rodney77> maybe I'll just have to leave it as-is
[10:14:03] <rodney77> I would think so
[10:14:09] <rodney77> this would seem to be the easiest solution
[10:16:02] <jphase> yeah, I mean writing a PHP script to send an email with the PHPMailer class is pretty cake, but it'd be nice to just disable one of the emails somewhere.
[10:21:13] <SyntheCypher> Anyone know why width() is returning 0 ?
[10:22:30] <jphase> SyntheCypher: would have to see that in context, you have a jsfiddle?
[10:22:55] <SyntheCypher> the project is a bit big to copy and paste it to jsfiddle
[10:23:02] <SyntheCypher> but the gists of it is....
[10:23:48] <SyntheCypher> https://gist.github.com/SyntheCypher/1295681f5252b901eea9
[10:24:34] <SyntheCypher> substitute the line "console.log($(cardView.el).css('width'));" for "console.log($(cardView.el).width());"
[10:25:02] <rodney77> i don't know, jphase. you don't think there would be a way to pass along that variable using jquery?
[10:25:32] <jphase> rodney77: that all depends on how that formbuilder thing is handling stuff. perhaps they have something in their docs?
[10:26:13] <SyntheCypher> jphase: I updated the gist
[10:27:05] <jphase> SyntheCypher: cardView.el is the element (before it's appended to the DOM)
[10:27:18] <jphase> you'd have to select it from the DOM to get the calculated width
[10:27:30] <SyntheCypher> how would I do that using jquery?
[10:27:54] <SyntheCypher> I thought $(cardView.el) would suffice
[10:28:15] <jphase> something like... this.$el.find(cardView.el.className.width()) or something?
[10:28:16] <jphase> hard to say
[10:28:38] <SyntheCypher> does append return the element once it's appended?
[10:28:39] <jphase> well, cardView.el is the element you created, but your .append appends a copy of that element
[10:28:45] <jphase> yeah perhaps
[10:28:50] <jphase> I haven't used it like that, but try that
[10:29:14] <SyntheCypher> How would you do it what you you say the 'optimal' way of doing it would be?
[10:29:44] <jphase> hmm, try console.log(this.$el.find(cardView.el).width());
[10:29:50] <jphase> I'm not sure with this little snippet
[10:30:19] <SyntheCypher> still 0
[10:30:24] <SyntheCypher> weird
[10:30:41] <jphase> and it appears to have a width after you've appended it right?
[10:30:47] <jphase> visually speaking
[10:30:53] <SyntheCypher> yeah
[10:31:10] <SyntheCypher> but there are loads of cards
[10:31:18] <SyntheCypher> all with identical structure
[10:31:25] <jphase> perhaps this is because backbone is happening asynchronously
[10:31:29] <SyntheCypher> so maybe it's best to pull the last one off the dom
[10:31:51] <jphase> this might not return a value inside the addCard function
[10:32:20] <jphase> check with the folks in #backbone to see if that's the case
[10:33:02] <jphase> I mean to me it looks like it should because you're calling the render() function before but I'm not sure really
[10:39:11] <SyntheCypher> jphase: how would you go about resizing a row to fit a screen width
[10:39:21] <SyntheCypher> Do instance 4 cards on a row
[10:39:43] <SyntheCypher> and depending on the screen size have the cards position and scale relative to the screenWidth?
[10:40:19] <jphase> well I'd do it with CSS personally
[10:40:21] <SyntheCypher> I was going to do it via left/right css and -webkit-transform scale()
[10:40:31] <jphase> does that apply here? or do you need to use jQuery?
[10:40:50] <SyntheCypher> I just wanted a little bit of insight from someone with more experience
[10:41:09] <SyntheCypher> I don't want to head of doing something the wrong way
[10:41:18] <SyntheCypher> when it could be done in an easier way
[10:41:21] <jphase> well to fit to screen I normally do most of my bidding with styles and break points
[10:41:31] <jphase> you can do it with jQuery though
[10:41:47] <SyntheCypher> I'm using zepto would that make a difference?
[10:41:47] <jphase> but it's more load on the front-end and such so I normally use css, nothiing wrong with that at all
[10:41:54] <SyntheCypher> cool
[10:42:03] <SyntheCypher> to scale do you use webkit-transform?
[10:42:04] <jphase> nah, shouldn't really as long as you have classes/ids/selectors to grab
[10:42:27] <jphase> well I normally give 100% width and then use the containers to size
[10:42:54] <jphase> where you have like 4 columns with 25% width or something
[10:43:09] <SyntheCypher> right
[10:43:23] <SyntheCypher> but I have images
[10:43:39] <jphase> yeah, just only set the width and let the height be relative
[10:43:40] <SyntheCypher> would the 100% within a container cause it to resize appropriately?
[10:43:49] <jphase> yeah, keeps aspect ratio if you leave height out
[10:43:59] <SyntheCypher> ok thanks
[10:44:01] <jphase> np
[10:44:27] <jphase> breakpoints will be nice if you have > 2 columns per row (for mobile)
[11:19:16] <Guest65124> hey
[11:19:22] <jphase> hi
[11:19:31] <Guest65124> anyone there able to help with pushState/popState events ?
[11:19:59] <jphase> Guest65124: just ask your question and whoever can help will be sure to speak up ;)
[11:20:15] <Guest65124> jphase: ok :)
[11:27:00] <Guest65124> Scenario: I am running out of time and I had developed an online mp3 tracker for now. It's an academic project and I need to make the audio persistent. So far I can use an iframe or Ajax requests all over the place. Since the work it's almost done and there are some Ajax calls already, I decided to use an iframe. With that and being new to the 'history' thing on HTML5 I got pushState to work the way I wanted it to but the PopStateE
[11:28:45] <Guest65124> I think I am missing something.. Anyway, any help would be appreciated :) Thank you
[11:29:00] <Bor> can somebody help me with a bug in my jquery slider?
[11:29:39] <jphase> Guest65124: what seems to be the issue with your popstate?
[11:30:07] <jphase> Bor: what seems to be the issue with your jquery slider?
[11:30:32] <Guest65124> jphase: I think about the iframe.. but since I am working with it's parent history I can't answer you on a better way..
[11:30:59] <Guest65124> jphase: This is what I have tried until now: https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8173654
[11:31:27] <jphase> Guest65124: you can access the parent with window.parent.pushState
[11:31:40] <jphase> same works for popState and other properties of the parent window
[11:32:04] <Guest65124> yeah, I did that. look at the snippet on that url please.. I am missing something for sure :\
[11:32:26] <jphase> Bor: go ahead and ask your question in here, I'm working atm and you might get a quicker response if you ask the whole chan
[11:33:02] <jphase> whoops I missed my history part there hehe
[11:33:26] <Bor> sorry,  the slider can be seen here       http://vvemms.nl/    the bug is, that the images are on the left side of the website, but it should be centered
[11:37:48] <Velveeta> bor: your slider is absolutely positioned, with left 0px, that's why it's up against the left wall
[11:38:14] <Velveeta> you might try placing it inside your #boven element, since that one is relatively positioned, and holding all the whitespace for your slider to fit inside of
[11:38:26] <zulcc> i can't find the error here. i think the failure is related to passing the css to the function as object, but i can't figure why it's not working. maybe i'm overlooking the obvious due to beeing tired: http://dpaste.com/1528769/ thanks for your time
[11:39:20] <Velveeta> zulcc: passing settings to the css() function as an object map is a valid use case of that function, so it's gotta be something else
[11:39:32] <Velveeta> if you can turn that into a function demo via jsfiddle or something, i might be able to help
[11:39:59] <Velveeta> guest65124: i wish i could help w/ your issue also, but i haven't use push/popstate yet myself, though you did just highlight one more thing i need to read up on :)
[11:40:02] <jphase> Guest65124: is the problem that your pushstate event is not firing?
[11:40:28] <jphase> the console log function that is?
[11:40:38] <Guest65124> jphase: pushState is working like a charm.. even with a single line.. popstate doesn't
[11:40:46] <Guest65124> Velveeta: np :)
[11:41:53] <jphase> Guest65124: but is the window.onpopstatue function there not logging or just not logging the values?
[11:43:25] <Guest65124> it does log "no state" all the time.. checking the e variable.. all is set but not the state property
[11:43:46] <Guest65124> jphase: look what i am trying now LOL w8
[11:44:32] <zulcc> the error thrown is in the main jquery.js line5, "TypeError: o.nodeName is undefined". is the $(this)-context staying correct when using it throughout multiple functions like that? the deeper $(this) refers to the $(this) delivered by the outer .each(), whereafter the function containing the deeper is called
[11:44:56] <jphase> Guest65124: hmm, well if there's no state property at all then that's another thing, but MDN uses JSON.stringify(event.state) on their example
[11:44:57] <Velveeta> bor: as to the markup you posted, i know what your markup looks like already, i inspected it in chrome, that's why i suggested you move that element inside of your #boven element
[11:45:36] <Velveeta> zulcc: i got lost reading that, can you put it together into a jsfiddle example so i can actually work with it interactively and see what's going on?
[11:45:46] <Guest65124> jphase: https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8174008 I know but it's null.. when i log console.log(e) (here state = null)
[11:46:30] <zulcc> Velveeta: phew, i'll try. there is a whole other chunk to the code as well
[11:47:35] <Velveeta> well, i don't need to see all of it, just the part that pertains to this individual piece not working properly
[11:48:08] <Guest65124> jphase: and i can't get rid of that iframe caching all the time when i go back i get "not found in cache".. tried headers and it's reload property for god sake lol
[11:48:35] <zulcc> i meant the $(this) in submitButtonInit() is supposed to refer to the .each() objects from buttonGenerator(), maybe it gets thrown out of context
[11:48:39] <Bor> I just have to merge the settings from element #header with #boven?
[11:48:55] <jphase> well I know there's issues with the child messing with the parent's history states but that's usually pushing extra stuff onto the history stack
[11:49:01] <jphase> hmm
[11:49:30] <Velveeta> bor: not the settings, move the actual markup inside of the other element, the whole chunk of html that defines #header, try nesting it inside of the #boven element
[11:50:48] <jphase> Guest65124: out of curiosity what browser are you using?
[11:50:49] <zulcc> jsfiddle doesnt feature jquery-ui, so it might become difficult to get button() working
[11:51:03] <jphase> zulcc: you can get jquery-ui in there
[11:51:30] <Velveeta> bor: and once you've moved #header inside of #boven, set its top to about 30px
[11:52:03] <Brogrammer> Hi
[11:52:04] <Guest65124> jphase: chrome 31.0.1650.63 m
[11:52:13] <jphase> dang, I was hoping that was your issue hehe
[11:52:28] <Velveeta> zulcc: you can add jquery ui in as an external library
[11:52:51] <Velveeta> zulcc: just get your initial implementation in there, if there are errors about missing libraries, i can help get those cleared away
[11:52:56] <Guest65124> jphase: that popstate seems to be triggered the wrong way.. why does it trigger when request a new page into the iframe ? it should be responding to the back button
[11:53:06] <Velveeta> brogrammer: sup bro
[11:53:17] * Velveeta types with his pecs.
[11:53:19] <zulcc> ah, i see! 'external resources'
[11:53:42] <Velveeta> zulcc: right, that's a direct link to the js in question, so you can drop in a link from the google code cdn
[11:55:08] <jphase> Guest65124: the onpopstate event is supposed to fire when the back button is clicked or history.back() function is called. Neither of these are happening and it's firing?
[11:55:12] <Guest65124> jphase: "samuil February 23rd, 2011, 06:20 AM Is there a way to handle user pressing 'back' event? From what I've seen it automatically calls PopState() method, but I'd like to perform more than this default action." this seems to be fake ..
[11:55:58] <Guest65124> jphase: yeah. it does fire when clicking a new link on the iframe..
[11:56:22] <jphase> well that'd be onpushstate rather than onpopstate
[11:56:33] <jphase> but onpushstate doesn't fire either?
[11:56:34] <Guest65124> jphase: whenever i click back button it seems to does the real back event.. failing to load the iframe contents cause of "cache"
[11:56:57] <Guest65124> jphase: yeah, clicking back it doesn't fire.. cause browser is executing it's normal behaviour..
[11:57:07] <Bor> it messes up the whole website Velveeta
[11:57:17] <Bor> #header {
[11:57:17] <Bor> height:183px;
[11:57:17] <Bor> left:0px;
[11:57:17] <Bor> margin:0 auto;
[11:57:17] <Bor> position:absolute;
[11:57:17] <Bor> top:59px;
[11:57:17] <Bor> width:990px;
[11:57:18] <Bor> z-index:3;
[11:57:18] <Bor> }
[11:57:23] <Velveeta> whoa whoa whoa, don't paste that crap here
[11:57:36] <Velveeta> i told you, if you have to paste something for us to see, paste it into jsfiddle or something and give us the link
[11:57:36] <jphase> `frown
[11:58:12] <Velveeta> now, i used jquery on your site to manually append the #header element to the #boven element, and it worked just fine, so i'm not sure what you did, but i'll take a look
[11:58:47] <Velveeta> nothing has changed on there
[12:00:30] <jphase> Guest65124: there's a known issue with Chrome's console with the onpopstate event (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=101137&q=pushstate&colspec=ID%20Pri%20Mstone%20ReleaseBlock%20Area%20Feature%20Status%20Owner%20Summary)
[12:00:33] <Guest65124> jphase: ok, consider just the part that it's not firing up when clicking the back button
[12:00:57] <jphase> apparently they suggest that you can use $('body').append( stuff )   to correctly log things with the native browser events
[12:01:13] <jphase> I'd double check this in firefox or safari or something to see if it behaves differently
[12:02:01] <Guest65124> jphase: buh..
[12:02:03] <Velveeta> and in IE 5.5
[12:02:07] <jphase> hehe
[12:02:13] <Velveeta> my guess is that it will behave differently there...............
[12:02:13] <jphase> yeah don't forget IE 5.5 testing too
[12:02:20] <Velveeta> also, mosaic
[12:02:25] <jphase> and nutscrape
[12:02:31] <Velveeta> and lynx! :D
[12:02:39] <jphase> lynx ftw!
[12:03:50] <Bor> appending header element to the boven element is in the css file or in html?
[12:04:12] <Velveeta> in the html...
[12:04:27] <zulcc> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/L25YG/
[12:04:48] <Velveeta> zulcc: thanks, ok, what do i need to do in here to recreate your issue?
[12:05:46] <Bor> ok cna you check again, please
[12:05:55] <Velveeta> zulcc: it's currently missing a reference to datetimepicker, what plugin are you using for that?
[12:05:58] <Velveeta> bor: sure
[12:06:31] <zulcc> Velveeta: it only fails for the ui-creation ( button() ) of the submit buttons. the code itself works, the other elements are transforming into button()s. just not the submit's anymore after separating the submitButtonInit()
[12:06:54] <Velveeta> bor: it doesn't look like you added the #header html to the #boven html, it looks like you wrapped #header in another #boven element, which is invalid html, because now you have 2 #boven elements on the page, and id's are supposed to be unique
[12:07:28] <Velveeta> zulcc: ok i'll comment out the datetimepicker for now to clear that error and then see what i can figure out
[12:07:51] <Guest65124> jphase: http://html5doctor.com/demos/history/ this works
[12:07:53] <zulcc> Velveeta: thanks for looking at it
[12:08:14] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:08:19] <jphase> yeah, they should work on page load
[12:09:01] <Guest65124> jphase: the difference it.. they're doing all client-side or considering an ajax request.. wouldn't be the same to a page that just have an iframe? (ok, the iframe src it's not always the same but it does push the state to the paren't history)
[12:09:32] <Velveeta> zulcc: ok, i have a solution for you
[12:09:34] <jphase> yeah since the history object is belonging to the window AJAX requests won't alter that
[12:09:39] <Guest65124> is* parents *
[12:09:49] <Guest65124> hmm
[12:09:58] <Velveeta> zulcc: and you were right, it's losing scope.. have you ever dealt with modifying function scope at invocation-time?
[12:10:00] <Guest65124> jphase: what could i be doing wrong ? :x
[12:10:31] <Velveeta> zulcc: http://jsfiddle.net/L25YG/3/
[12:11:02] <Bor> please check again velveetga
[12:11:21] <Velveeta> zulcc: when you call an external function like that, it doesn't automatically inherit the current scope, it uses its own scope, which in this case, is the global (window) object, so you have to explicitly pass function scope through Function.call or Function.apply, as i've done here
[12:11:25] <Velveeta> bor: sure
[12:11:47] <Velveeta> bor: now that's looking much better, does it seem to be working for you?
[12:12:00] <jphase> Guest65124: the iframe itself has its own window element, now as to when those fire is a bit of uncharted territory for me. I've only worked with the push/popstate events normally and haven't really had to try to bind to a child iframe's events. It looks like folks tend to appreciate using history.js when dealing with the history object between iframes. I personally don't know much outside of the native functionality
[12:12:14] <jphase> how those fire*
[12:12:37] <Bor> haha yeah that's perfect! thanks , but the weird thing is, the slider is 2 years old, and I did nothing with the code before
[12:12:52] <Velveeta> jphase: i haven't been paying attention to this, but did you say bind to a child iframe's events? because i don't think events bubble past the iframe barrier
[12:13:11] <Velveeta> bor: hmmm that's definitely weird
[12:13:12] <jphase> yeah, I missing what's going on with the iframe here
[12:13:15] <jphase> only have bits of the code
[12:13:22] <jphase> but there's reference to the parent here
[12:13:41] <Velveeta> what link are you viewing it at? i'll take a quick peak
[12:13:44] <jphase> I've seen people talk about using history.js to deal with iframey things and these events though on stackoverflow
[12:14:06] <jphase> https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8174008
[12:14:07] <Velveeta> i've never used push/popstate myself, but i might be able to figure out how to do something, or else validate that it can't be done :D
[12:14:18] <jphase> https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8173654
[12:14:39] <jphase> hard to test this without seeing anything but a chunk and don't have a working example :\
[12:15:25] <zulcc> Velveeta: awesome!! thanks. that .call sure is a great gimmick for me to learn
[12:15:56] <Velveeta> zulcc: that's how jquery does all of its own magic internally, for dispatching callbacks :)
[12:16:14] <Velveeta> that's why you can run the same function for any element selector, and it executes with that element as its scope
[12:17:14] <Guest65124> Velveeta: i can explain u the whole situation if you think you can help me :)
[12:18:00] <jphase> man, I wish folks just had servers they could throw examples up on :\
[12:18:02] <Velveeta> guest65124: well, 1 question is have is why you're using triggerHandler vs trigger to dispatch that event?
[12:18:30] <Guest65124> Velveeta: that was just to test.. not the real code in there..
[12:18:34] <Velveeta> gotcha
[12:18:43] <Velveeta> well triggerHandler won't trigger the actual event default behavior
[12:19:02] <Velveeta> so e.g. for a click, it won't trigger an actual click behavior on say, an anchor, it'll just trigger the callbacks that listen for it
[12:19:10] <Guest65124> Velveeta: hmm, ok.. ok.. so, do u see this working with pushState/popState? http://html5doctor.com/demos/history/
[12:19:32] <Velveeta> so if you have native push/popstate event behavior you're expecting to happen, i don't think it'll trigger that either
[12:19:45] <Guest65124> Velveeta: oh, nice :) new to jquery.. buh x)
[12:19:56] <Velveeta> so yeah, i see that demo working
[12:20:02] <Velveeta> let me look at their code
[12:20:17] <Guest65124> Velveeta ok :) let me know when u finished x)
[12:22:06] <Velveeta> guest65124: so yeah, they're relying on the native history.back functionality to navigate the user back, and programmatically adding to the pushstate on click
[12:24:39] <Guest65124> Velveeta: indeed and i want to do something like that but.. having a static page with an mp3 player with an iframe element (a dynamic one.. pushing states to the main page history)
[12:24:58] <Guest65124> Velveeta: and with an *
[12:26:10] <Guest65124> Velveeta: the pushState is faking the url as supposed to.. (i want the user to track the "real" user in order to share it or bookmark it and getting the proper page when clicking on it)
[12:26:26] <Guest65124> Velveeta: real url *
[12:27:24] <Velveeta> guest65124: so you're wanting to use the iframe for the user to do their *actual* navigation in for mp3s, but as they navigate from one to the other, you want to push the history state to the parent, and if they go back in their browser, have that control the iframe's history state instead of the parent, does that sound about right?
[12:27:31] <Guest65124> Velveeta: the popstate seems to be useless at all ... whenever i click the back button.. it doesn't even fire and the browser tries to handle it's default behaviour on that
[12:27:36] <dblosevn> Guest65124: to do that completely on the clientside youll need to use a hash instead, otherwise you will need some creative mod rewrite rules on the server
[12:29:29] <Guest65124> Velveeta: hmm, i just want to make the audio persistent.. and the iframe seems to be the only idea for now.. i got ajax calls all over the page.. don't want more ajax for that..
[12:29:33] <dblosevn> Guest65124: something like http://domain.com/index.html#mp3/something.mp3 really bad url structure but you get the idea, then youd parse the hash on load
[12:30:34] <Guest65124> dblosevn: yeah, i know what you mean.. but.. i just want the browser to have fake the location the iframe's in and pushState did the trick.. the bad part comes when i try to click back on the browser.. it goes by doesn't fire any popstate event
[12:31:14] <dblosevn> I do something quite similar to that in a cms I built that all requests are ajax but theres direct links to every page in the cms, you have to watch for locationChange
[12:31:56] <Velveeta> does locationChange broadcast an event?
[12:32:09] <dblosevn> I was unaware popstate was an event, I thought popstate was just a method to manipulate the backstack
[12:32:27] <Velveeta> i'm new to all this history manipulation hullabaloo
[12:33:04] <dblosevn> Velveeta: I made that up, from everything I have seen you need a pluginto get that functionality
[12:33:15] <Velveeta> gotcha
[12:33:44] <dblosevn> `g jquery hashchange
[12:33:46] <b-ot> dblosevn: Ben Alman » jQuery hashchange event → http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[12:33:55] <dblosevn> thats usually what I use
[12:34:04] <Guest65124> but i don't want that hash-hack thing lol
[12:34:23] <dblosevn> You will have to use it if you want shareable links without serverside monkeyinh
[12:34:27] <dblosevn> *monkeying
[12:34:39] <Guest65124> Velveeta: https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8173654 this is what i got.. pushState works.. iframe fake-clean-links working... popstate fcked up
[12:34:51] <Velveeta> i still have a few days left before i head back to work, and haven't read/listened to nearly as much ongoing education as i meant to… i did some nodejs piping/streaming stuff, some mvvm/observable object stuff, now push/popstate are on my list, along with some various framework event object structure stuff i need to know for a github side project
[12:35:12] <dblosevn> Guest65124: what are you using for a server?
[12:35:28] <dblosevn> php, node what
[12:35:38] <Guest65124> dblosevn: apache.. php
[12:36:12] <dblosevn> you could make it work with out hashes but only with mod rewrite otherwise when they share a url it will 404
[12:36:27] <Velveeta> guest65124: those comments look like you have the history.pushstate call inside the iframe, right? and the popstate in the parent document?
[12:36:54] <Velveeta> dblosevn: i don't know how interested he is in sharing url's, i think this is for like a class project kind of thing
[12:37:17] <Velveeta> i think he's just trying to add in some extra functionality, but did it w/ an embedded iframe because it was quick and easy and he's close to deadline
[12:37:28] <dblosevn> Velveeta: he did mention he wanted shareable urls
[12:37:32] <Guest65124> Velveeta: fixed an error: parent.history...*
[12:37:34] <Velveeta> oh, well then
[12:38:10] <Guest65124> Velveeta: mistyped that but not the problem.. had parent.history on the real code :\ buh
[12:39:30] <dblosevn> Velveeta: [15:26] <Guest65124> Velveeta: the pushState is faking the url as supposed to.. (i want the user to track the "real" user in order to share it or bookmark it and getting the proper page when clicking on it)
[12:40:46] <dblosevn> While he has fixed the nav on the page, he still doesnt have a solution that will allow bookmarking etc
[12:41:23] <dblosevn> which sadly is kind of the point of manipulating the backstack lol
[12:41:30] <Velveeta> right
[12:43:38] <Guest65124> Velveeta dblosevn so, i am out of luck? right? anyway, this is the code i have til now: https://gist.github.com/undeadd/8173654 if anyone can help me out..
[12:43:46] <zulcc> $('button').button({ icons: { secondary: $(this).attr('icon')     the $(this) here should be referring to the 'button' selector object? how do you know which jquery actions change the $(this)-reference and which ones don't?
[12:45:00] <dblosevn> Guest65124: if you dont want to use hashes youll only have to do a little serversided trickey to get it to work,
[12:45:14] <Guest65124> Velveeta dblosevn i think the only options to do this are iframes or ajax.. but if i want the url to be shown and used like a permalink i will have to get this history thing to work..
[12:45:40] <Guest65124> dblosevn: what exactly? :)
[12:45:57] <Velveeta> zulcc: the 'this' in that case should not be referring to the button selector, it would be referring to whatever code block that whole statement is nested inside of… typically, callback functions inherit the scope of the selector they're bound to in jquery… in this case, that button function you're calling, you're passing an object map of options, and secondary is one of those options, but it's not a callback function, so the scop
[12:45:57] <Velveeta> button, it points to whatever the scope is for that whole statement
[12:46:01] <zulcc> Guest65124: i never got the history plugin to work, i ended up doing it with the jquery address plugin and the apache rewrite engine
[12:46:17] <dblosevn> RewriteRule ^something_unique/* yourpage.html
[12:46:41] <Guest65124> dblosevn: oh, i see.. fck :|
[12:46:57] <micz123> hi all :)
[12:47:01] <dblosevn> then its just on parsing the location on the first ready event
[12:47:17] <dblosevn> to do it all on the client youll have to use hashes
[12:47:19] <Guest65124> dblosevn: but that way the users clicks and the url would be the same on every page..
[12:47:35] <micz123> today i want to ask abt this $this.trigger('ajax:start', [$this, url, method, data]); what is ajax:start?
[12:47:40] <dblosevn> ya but the url doesnt exist so the only way to get to it would be to click a link on the page
[12:47:54] <dblosevn> hence mod rewrite or hashes
[12:48:13] <Guest65124> dblosevn: the url exists.. the webpage is developed.. all i am doing now is wrapping it on the iframe to make the audio player sound persistent..
[12:48:27] <Guest65124> things like /user/{id} works..
[12:48:32] <dblosevn> the fake urls you are creating with push/popstate dont though
[12:48:54] <dblosevn> unless they do any your using push/pop state when you dont need too
[12:49:08] <zulcc> Velveeta: aah. okay. how do you refer to the .attr of the button element there instead of $(this)? is there a more convenient way than re-selecting $('button') in there?
[12:49:45] <Guest65124> they're fake just because there's an iframe wrapping it.. if you type localhost/user/view/1 it does works.. and not with rewrite.. (url parsed via request object.. using yii here)
[12:50:18] <dblosevn> Guest65124: but does it actuallt wrap it in the iframe when you nav to that url? I would think the ui would be different
[12:50:29] <Velveeta> micz123: that looks like an older style of event naming i haven't seen in a while, but ajax:start looks like it would just be some custom event that causes some other function to kick off an ajax request, using the data passed along w/ the event
[12:50:32] <nicholasschulz> how do i keep these images square when adjusting the width of the window? http://jsfiddle.net/tx7sf/95/
[12:50:56] <Guest65124> dblosevn: yeah ! if you type a "real" url it's mapped into the iframe's content
[12:51:06] <micz123> velveeta do we have to use " : "?
[12:51:25] <Velveeta> zulcc: you'd probably want to .each() through your button collection so that each time you reference $(this).attr('whatever') that it's referring to that specific button instance, because $('button') will technically reference every button tag on the page
[12:51:27] <dblosevn> Guest65124: I would think that behavior wouldnt be the goal but if thats what you want :-)
[12:51:27] <Guest65124> i just want to make this transparent to the user.. and it is.. except that back button thing
[12:51:32] <micz123> can i just name it ajaxStart?
[12:51:51] <Guest65124> dblosevn: yeah, that's what i want.. this is for academic purposes..
[12:51:52] <Velveeta> micz123: you can name it whatever you want, so long as you have the other end listening for the same name
[12:52:25] <zulcc> Velveeta: in this case i want the $('button'), because i know that there is only one <button> on that page
[12:52:34] <micz123> $(document).on('ajaxStart', function(){}); ? velveeta?
[12:52:35] <dblosevn> Guest65124: I would think that the ui would be the same whter I click a link on the site or nav back via a bookmark, eg... the content would always be in the iframe reguardless
[12:53:40] <Velveeta> zulcc: you'll still need to .each() your way through that collection of 1, to force 'this' to be the scope of that button
[12:53:54] <Velveeta> but an added bonus is that you're futureproofing it against the addition of more buttons
[12:54:00] <Velveeta> micz123: yep
[12:54:43] <micz123> velveeta if i put the trigger and the binding on different files, would that be ok?
[12:54:59] <Guest65124> dblosevn: think this way: i have the entire webpage done.. working with real urls.. the thing now is that i need to make the audio persistent.. without changing anything about the old behaviour
[12:55:00] <dblosevn> Guest65124: but to answer your question, I would bind the popstate on both the parent and the iframe and add trace info to the log to see which one is firing
[12:55:26] <Guest65124> dblosevn: the thing is none of them have the state set :x
[12:55:41] <dblosevn> Guest65124: which browser
[12:55:46] <Guest65124> dblosevn: already done it.. and i can't get what's missing.. that demo works..
[12:55:55] <Velveeta> micz123: sure, as long as both of those files are loaded
[12:56:01] <Guest65124> dblosevn: chrome 31.0.1650.63 m
[12:56:13] <Guest65124> dblosevn: the same used to check that demo page (and it's working in there)
[12:57:32] <rbw> hello. items are highlighted (same behavior as click / tap) when scrolling / swiping over a listview in JQM. is this normal behavior or have I done something wrong?
[12:58:12] <HowardwLo> hello! https://dpaste.de/aTwN i'm trying to make a button clickable only once and avoid any problems by setting a delay of 5 seconds to reopen the button again (incase user disconnects or something crazy). Trouble is, setTimeout hangs the browser. I want the submit request to go through, but incase it doesn't, the button needs to revert back to clickable. any advice?
[13:00:47] <Velveeta> nicholasschuilz: there's no way to do this with just css that i know of, but you can add some jquery to handle it for you: http://jsfiddle.net/tx7sf/99/
[13:01:17] <m_gol> nicholasschulz: http://jsfiddle.net/m_gol/tx7sf/100/
[13:01:22] <Velveeta> howardwlo: setTimeout shouldn't hang the browser, can you post a sample of your code in a demo on jsfiddle?
[13:01:29] <m_gol> Velveeta: yest, there is ;)
[13:01:44] <m_gol> the trick is padding-top/padding-bottom if set to % are computed relative to width, not height
[13:02:01] <HowardwLo> Velveeta: one minute, i'll get that for ya
[13:02:12] <HowardwLo> Velveeta: maybe the submit request took longer than 5 seconds....
[13:02:15] <Velveeta> m_gold: aha! very nice, i've only ever seen that method used once before by dave rupert for making responsive embedded youtube videos, i'd forgotten all about that technique :)
[13:02:22] <Velveeta> m_gol even
[13:02:51] <m_gol> Velveeta: note that it doesn't work correctly on flex items
[13:03:13] <m_gol> Firefox & spec say that for flex items padding-top/-bottom refer to height
[13:03:27] <m_gol> the resto of the browsers do it differently :P
[13:03:41] <m_gol> which means in practice you can't use it on flex items at all...
[13:05:56] <micz123> velveeta uugh i tried but its not working
[13:06:16] <Velveeta> micz123: post us a jsfiddle demo
[13:06:48] <micz123> velveeta ok, but can jsfiddle runs ajax call?
[13:07:16] <micz123> im not too familiar with ajax call in jsfiddle
[13:07:56] <Velveeta> it can't run an ajax call, but we can watch it error when it tries
[13:08:04] <Velveeta> which will mean it's at least triggering the ajax call properly to be run
[13:09:17] <nicholasschulz> thanks m_gol
[13:09:56] <HowardwLo> Velveeta: you're right, it doesn't hang the browser. the request was just taking exactly 5 seconds. I extended it to 15 and now its working perfectly. Thanks!
[13:12:00] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:15:58] <micz123> velveeta http://jsfiddle.net/micz123/MbZNC/
[13:16:55] <micz123> velveeta the code that is the prob is in line 15
[13:17:10] <micz123> velveeta and 53-65
[13:17:20] <micz123> line 15 triggers the events
[13:17:32] <micz123> line 53-65 supposed to catch it
[13:18:09] <micz123> if it works, it should append class 'msg' with the text provided
[13:20:28] <Velveeta> micz123: you have a combination of race condition and bad scope going on: http://jsfiddle.net/MbZNC/6/
[13:21:10] <micz123> velveeta uughh which ones are they?
[13:21:14] <Velveeta> actually scratch that
[13:21:19] <Velveeta> you just had a race condition going on
[13:21:38] <Velveeta> so, you have your listener bound to the document, so it'll catch ajaxcall events for any element they're triggered on, that part's fine
[13:22:10] <Velveeta> the problem was that you're calling the selfLoad function, which in turn calls the processAjax function, which in turn triggers that event, before document.ready is binding your event listener
[13:22:19] <Velveeta> you don't have a document.ready on your call to selfLoad()
[13:23:33] <Velveeta> and even with that in place, it's bound first out of those 2 document.ready's, so it'll still execute prior to your listener being bound, so you have 2 options… 1: add a setTimeout of like 1ms to the call to selfLoad, after wrapping it in a document.ready call (which i've done); 2: move the code at the bottom to the top of the file instead, so that document.ready executes before the other one naturally
[13:24:15] <Velveeta> with #2 done, this is what it looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/MbZNC/8/
[13:24:51] <Velveeta> i removed the setTimeout, but kept the document.ready wrapper, and moved the IIFE from the bottom to the top of the file instead
[13:25:34] <micz123> velveeta what is IIFE?
[13:25:44] <Velveeta> immediately-invoked function expression
[13:25:51] <dblosevn> `g IIFE
[13:25:54] <b-ot> dblosevn: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:26:19] <micz123> velveeta so with the #2 i should reorder my js files?
[13:26:44] <micz123> make ajax-core first then selfrun.js?
[13:28:25] <Velveeta> yeah, your ajax core should load before anything that tried to use it
[13:29:05] <Velveeta> and then make sure that any auto-executing code is wrapped in a document.ready call, if it relies on the document being ready, which is anything that interacts with the DOM, including the document node itself
[13:30:06] <micz123> velveeta thanks, i'll try to read ur explanation a few times until i really get it :D this makes my head hurts
[13:30:09] <micz123> LOL
[13:30:44] <Velveeta> micz123: anytime you have code touching the dom, which is any jquery selector, any $(document).on(), etc, it needs to be forced to wait for document.ready
[13:33:10] <micz123> velveeta  i think i get it, thx... so its fine if i make 2 or 3 autoexecuting codes as long as i make them wait for document to be ready (and put it way way back)?
[13:33:25] <Velveeta> right
[13:33:39] <Velveeta> also, if your self-executing code doesn't do dom operations, it can execute without waiting for document.ready
[13:34:21] <micz123> velveeta thx a great bunch :D I'll tinker more with the revised codes, yay!
[13:34:57] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:43:03] <Guest65124> ok, got the problem !
[13:52:13] <NemesisD> hey guys. designing an api client that hits a rest API. using jquery for the ajax layer. want to expose a deferred/promise based api but i realized i don't know how people do streaming/paginated resources with promises since they can only resolve once
[13:56:35] <Velveeta> nemesisd: you'd have to return a new promise for each page, which presumably you'd be making a separate request for anyway
[13:56:50] <Velveeta> the $.ajax function returns its own promise, so you can literally just return $.ajax(options);
[13:57:10] <Velveeta> guest65124: how'd you end up handling it?
[14:02:13] <Guest65124> Velveeta: 2 problems: addEventListener with ONpopstate... it's just popstate.. it is fired by the iframe's parent and pushState was in the right place. the second and fatal error is the submitting form.. i think it messes up the stack til that moment.. return no states after a new request (made indirectly by that form submit)
[14:02:32] <Guest65124> Velveeta: this means.. i will have to handle up without that freaking iframe and got some ajax working on this :D
[14:03:31] <Guest65124> all the wanted and needed features will be there this way too.. so..
[14:03:35] <Guest65124> ty anyway, i think :D
[14:09:14] <javalover> I have an issue with my imports
[14:09:34] <javalover> sometimes the script works & others it doesn't load
[14:09:54] <javalover> is there a standard way of using the <script src=""> tag?
[14:10:52] <javalover> for example i'm using validate & sometimes the extras for phone # validation loads & others it won't load....
[14:12:28] <Velveeta> guest65124: can you not use an ajax form within your iframe?
[14:13:02] <Velveeta> javalover: i have no clue what you're asking… a standard way of using the ,script src=""> tag?
[14:13:13] <javalover> basically what would cause a script not to load?
[14:13:23] <dblosevn> javalover: racecondition
[14:13:35] <Velveeta> 404
[14:13:48] <Guest65124> Velveeta: it will do the same.. i didn't want to have to use ajax.. since i have.. no point on using an iframe
[14:13:50] <dblosevn> Velveeta: he said it works sometimes
[14:13:52] <javalover> well 404 is duh i'm thinking it's probably racecondition
[14:13:56] <dblosevn> so likely its a race
[14:14:03] <javalover> what's proper way to deal with this?
[14:14:10] <javalover> is there a tutorial/example i can follow?
[14:14:18] <dblosevn> put everything dealing with the dom in a ready
[14:14:35] <javalover> oh
[14:14:46] <javalover> yeah it could be that
[14:14:59] <javalover> okay so i have another issue then
[14:15:06] <Velveeta> well i was only throwing out the 404 as an answer to "what would cause a script not to load" :D
[14:15:07] <dblosevn> and if async call 1 relys on async call 2 make sure not to call both at once etc
[14:15:15] <javalover> I use .load() to load outside elements & some of these .loads have script tags in them
[14:15:23] <dblosevn> :-D that defintieyl would cause it not to load lol
[14:15:24] <javalover> bingo
[14:15:37] <Velveeta> but i've never seen a race condition cause a script not to load, it might load and cause an error, or load and fire event bindings too early or something
[14:15:47] <javalover> I agree with Velveeta
[14:15:53] <javalover> I think that's it...I just don't know how to manage this
[14:16:00] <dblosevn> Velveeta: it would appear not to load being its loading too early
[14:16:05] <Velveeta> right, gotcha
[14:16:09] <javalover> same thing though
[14:16:15] <javalover> the error is thrown beforehand
[14:16:26] <dblosevn> I would be willing to wger if you threw some trace statements in it, you would see them executed 100% of the time
[14:16:40] <javalover> well then lets just make it simple
[14:16:57] <Velveeta> javalover: if you have dependent scripts, they need to be loaded in the order of their dependencies… if you have scripts that you're loading via jquery's .load() method (using a dom element to target their output to), you need to make sure those are registered with a document.ready callback
[14:16:59] <javalover> so A loads B both have ready functions & both have scripts
[14:17:51] <javalover> how do I check?
[14:17:58] <dblosevn> Velveeta: if your using jquery to load a cript and only a script you should use .loadScript with the callback
[14:18:09] <javalover> ic
[14:18:12] <javalover> i'll look into that
[14:18:13] <javalover> 1 sec
[14:18:18] <dblosevn> `api loadScript
[14:18:18] <b-ot> dblosevn: No matches.
[14:18:26] <dblosevn> grr hold on
[14:18:26] <Velveeta> dblosevn: right, i thought he was saying he was loading a mix of content and scripts
[14:19:00] <dblosevn> `api getScript
[14:19:08] <b-ot> dblosevn: No matches.
[14:19:14] <javalover> so the browser is dumb?
[14:19:20] <Velveeta> yes
[14:19:25] <javalover> so then
[14:19:27] <dblosevn> `api jquery.getScript
[14:19:27] <b-ot> dblosevn: jQuery.getScript(): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[14:19:32] <javalover> instead of <script> just do it in jquery?
[14:19:34] <Velveeta> all computers and programs are dumb, they only do exactly what you tell them to do
[14:19:36] <dblosevn> lol finally
[14:20:16] <javalover> okay so basically
[14:20:20] <dblosevn> script nodes that are inline with the page are loaded syncronously
[14:20:27] <javalover> awww
[14:20:31] <javalover> so they can have a conflict
[14:20:33] <javalover> but if i do it in ready
[14:20:35] <javalover> it won't conflict
[14:20:42] <dblosevn> script nodes injected after page load are processed async
[14:20:57] <javalover> okay 1 concern though
[14:21:07] <javalover> the starting point, like the loading of jquery itself
[14:21:15] <Velveeta> quick question, and not to sound condescending, but do you know the difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous load?
[14:21:49] <javalover> Although some words I don't know proper definition 2, it sounds like everything is loading all at once, but with this method it will be in order
[14:22:07] <dblosevn> Velveeta: well watch the net tab, sync loads youll only see one script loading at a time, async loads youll see multiple scripts loading
[14:22:22] <Velveeta> dblosevn: i know the difference, i was asking javalover :)
[14:22:31] <dblosevn> javalover: here check this out this is a script loader I wrote. Should answer your questions. http://lxedev.com/calcgap/js/init.js
[14:22:32] <javalover> yeah, i'm no vocab expert but I speak the lingo
[14:22:52] <Velveeta> javalover: right, a synchronous load means it has to wait for one thing to load, then proceed to the next and wait for it to load, etc, instead of loading things in parallel, which is what an asynchronous load does
[14:22:56] <dblosevn> uses deffereds and promisses etc
[14:23:09] <dblosevn> and even handles loading the jquery library before moving on
[14:23:12] <javalover> that's sexy
[14:23:28] <Velveeta> so a race condition is when you have scripts A and B, and B is dependent on A, and if A loads first, and *then* B loads, all is good, but if A and B load at the same time, and B finished loading first and is executed without A being in memory yet, you'll get errors
[14:23:30] <dblosevn> as well as the phonegap framework
[14:23:52] <javalover> amazingly Velveeta this was my first assumption
[14:23:57] <javalover> but I wanted to figure out how to fix it
[14:24:04] <javalover> I didn't know I could even load the scripts using javascript
[14:24:12] <Velveeta> you can also look into something like requirejs, which is a pretty widely-used utility for dependency management
[14:24:34] <javalover> mm i think imma manual it up & follow the script db posted
[14:24:35] <dblosevn> I didnt want the overhead of require so I wrote something super lightweight :-)
[14:25:03] <Velveeta> nice, you could also use almond, which is much more lightweight than require
[14:25:14] <Velveeta> but perhaps not as lightweight as your own
[14:26:10] <javalover> this is clearly my issue but tbh even though I didn't start doing this
[14:26:17] <javalover> I think it's best to do this in the end, as I can see what happens in the code
[14:26:55] <javalover> i've treated html poorly, thinking there was no intelligent way to do this
[14:26:59] <javalover> but imma fix that asap
[14:27:12] <dblosevn> http://lxedev.com/calcgap go there and watch the console :-)
[14:27:52] <javalover> nice
[14:27:57] <Velveeta> dblosevn: that init.js is yours?
[14:28:06] <dblosevn> ya wrote it a couple moths ago
[14:28:12] <dblosevn> months even
[14:28:33] <javalover> feels like a mobile app
[14:28:46] <dblosevn> selectively loads phonegap if your inside the phonegap app
[14:28:56] <Velveeta> does it handle crawling dependencies at all, or do they need to be specified in order up front?
[14:29:08] <dblosevn> just order them in the scripts array
[14:29:18] <Velveeta> gotcha
[14:29:21] <dblosevn> jquery is always loaded first
[14:29:46] <dblosevn> then defferds and promises are setup and a global ready listener after all promises are resolved
[14:29:51] <Velveeta> and are each of those array indexes loaded synchronously via a promise resolution? is there a way to specify that certain files can be loaded in parallel?
[14:30:42] <dblosevn> yes, go to the url I pasted, and open then console then refresh, youll see they always load in order async
[14:31:55] <dblosevn> well both async and sync, js is free to do other things while its loading scripts
[14:31:57] <Velveeta> well, i know that they're loaded asynchronously, but what i mean is are they loaded back-to-back asyncronously, like in a forced synchronous kind of method by waiting for one promise to resolve before loading the next file, or are they loaded in parallel?
[14:32:09] <dblosevn> eg script 2 can be doing things while its loading script 3
[14:32:12] <Velveeta> the scripts themselves, i don't see any kind of dependency relationship
[14:32:44] <Velveeta> so i'm assuming that there is no dependency relationship, or else every array index is treated as dependent on the previous one
[14:33:23] <Velveeta> i'll check the network tab
[14:33:32] <dblosevn> theres not a dependancy relationship, you just put the scripts in the array in the order they need to be in, I didnt want to go overboard bloating it up building a dependency model
[14:33:55] <dblosevn> the next script is never loaded until the last script has completed loading
[14:34:33] <Velveeta> ok, that's what i was wondering, so there's no way to specify that certain scripts are ok to load in parallel, it just treats them all as dependent in the order they're specified
[14:34:56] <dblosevn> also for jquery mobile apps it works out great because it never loads the scripts again so you can use just one script tag on all your pages
[14:35:21] <dblosevn> ya it always loads them in order, syncronously but without tieing up the js thread
[14:35:55] <Velveeta> right
[14:36:23] <dblosevn> because including all these scripts inline in the html would block the ui thread while not only loading the script but also while running the script it loaded
[14:37:08] <dblosevn> hence the old problems with google analytics hanging the entire page load until it was satisfied
[14:37:18] <javalover> dang
[14:37:18] <Velveeta> right, i can see the reason for doing the async load, i would personally prefer to use something like require or almond, though, to let each code module specify its dependencies for maintenance purposes
[14:37:58] <dblosevn> ya this app doesnt really require much, nor will it ever require more scripts to load the base.
[14:38:30] <dblosevn> now each module has its own script but they are loaded on demand and tossed from the dom when you change moules
[14:38:42] <dblosevn> but that doesnt happen in this loader
[14:39:22] <dblosevn> eg... heres a module http://lxedev.com/calcgap/js/core.pref.js
[14:40:09] <Velveeta> right
[14:40:13] <dblosevn> and heres the module loader http://pastebin.ca/2519957
[14:41:43] <dblosevn> I had to hack jquery mobile's page loading stack up quite a bit to support client side rendering of the pages, that took me forever to figure out. http://lxedev.com/calcgap/js/loader.js
[14:43:15] <Velveeta> i've never used jquery mobile for my own projects… i popped it in for a quicky work project onces, just for the touch event support, but the fact that it comes bundled with its own styling opinions forced me to rip it back out in about 30 seconds :D
[14:43:29] <Velveeta> i ended up just going with hammer.js for what i was looking to do
[14:43:33] <dblosevn> because rejecting the pagebeforeload deferred didnt have the desired effect at all :-( being almost everything I was doing in my listener was async jqm continued to try to load the page
[14:44:06] <dblosevn> we have done some pretty impressive work with jquery mobile
[14:44:27] <dblosevn> eg this ui http://lxedev.com/corephonegap/new/
[14:44:35] <dblosevn> thats jqm but doesnt feel it at all
[14:45:19] <Velveeta> i'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess you work for caterpillar :D
[14:45:56] <dblosevn> We havent finished the desktop breakpoints for it though, so set your browser to 1280x800 to match the res of a galaxy note 10.1
[14:46:05] <dblosevn> nope lol just do a lot of contract work for them
[14:46:19] <dblosevn> also for target and a few other big name companys
[14:47:15] <dblosevn> I work with a marketing firm that has super nice clients but they dont do IT stuff at all.
[14:47:36] <dblosevn> they just do environment and print type stuff and give all the development stuff to me
[14:48:00] <Velveeta> gotcha
[14:50:43] <Velveeta> an old coworker of mine just left our company and went to one here called mass relevance… apparently, one of the drawing factors for him was that clients hire them to do some custom web-based project, and they (mass relevance) get to specify the minimum environment for it to run in, which means he can say that this project is only valid in IE11+ and the edge version of chrome and FF
[14:51:03] <Velveeta> which means he gets to work on bleeding edge fun stuff, rather than be trapped in the IE7+ environment that we were forced to support :D
[14:51:15] <dblosevn> works ou pretty good I have limited to no interaction with the end clients and they hand everything over to me prepackaged and ready to code eg... psds workflows, wireframes, full color pdfs with flow etc
[14:52:46] <Velveeta> as far as your mockups are concerned, do you ever have issues (with them being from a mostly print-design shop in-house) with their designers handing over designs that don't exactly translate well to the web? i used to work with a designer that was strictly from a print background, and the kind of crap he churned out was perfectly well-suited for print, but sucked on the web, or just didn't work intuitively or at all
[14:52:46] <krastavac> why is this empty string? $("#gl_forma").serialize();
[14:52:46] <krastavac> fields filled
[14:52:46] <krastavac> ???
[14:53:05] <Velveeta> krastavac: misspelled id selector?
[14:53:15] <Velveeta> we can't answer that question without seeing some demo code
[14:53:18] <dblosevn> or the form doesnt have an id
[14:53:29] <dblosevn> could be a ton of things
[14:53:36] <dblosevn> `demo @ krastavac
[14:53:36] <b-ot> krastavac: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:54:44] <dblosevn> Velveeta: absolutely, and they have started to bring me in on the design concepts way earlier lately to point out problem areas
[14:54:59] <Fusl> does someone know if there is a way to catch url changes with javascript? i use history.push to add an url, which was requested with ajax to the history and change the url and window.onpopstate to listen for history for-/backward jumps by the user and now i want to listen for url changes.. any way of doing this? my code: http://dedilink.eu/mj24-static/main.js
[14:55:41] <Fusl> ps: i know that this question is not really jq but i think that you guys know javascript very well
[14:56:09] <dblosevn> I rememebr the first set of comps they sent me for a one page website, the dimensions were ungodly like 8500x5000 for a page that was supossed to fit the entire window without scrolling lol I could tell the just aut that out of AI or something from vector lmao
[14:56:30] <Velveeta> fusl: you're in luck, we just had a long conversation earlier about pushstate and url change tracking
[14:56:41] <Fusl> ah
[14:56:44] <Fusl> what time was it?
[14:56:49] <Fusl> i have logs where i can go through
[14:56:55] <Velveeta> in the last 2 hours or so maybe?
[14:57:35] <Velveeta> someone was talking about having to use hash changes to store the state of an embedded iframe, and that they used <some plugin> to track those hash changes
[14:57:46] <Velveeta> my guess is that it was via dirty checking of the url, but i'm not positive about that
[14:57:53] <dblosevn> 14:19 EST till 17:03 EST
[14:58:06] <Velveeta> here we go: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[14:58:08] <Fusl> i don't like hashes as we are in html5 and not html -999 or somewhere ^^
[14:58:28] <Velveeta> i don't get what that's supposed to mean
[14:58:32] <dblosevn> fus1: read my comments on that iun the time period I pasted
[14:58:49] <Fusl> dblosevn: what is EST?
[14:58:55] <Velveeta> eastern standard time
[14:58:59] <javalover> SUCCESS!
[14:59:00] <Fusl> gmt+what?
[14:59:00] <javalover> thx guys
[14:59:01] <dblosevn> eastern standard time I think GMT -7 right now
[14:59:02] <Velveeta> so convert that to your own local timezone
[14:59:07] <Velveeta> gmt - 4 i think
[14:59:07] <javalover> that was it I was even able to slow it down
[14:59:12] <T13|sleeps> Gmt -5
[14:59:25] <Fusl> gmt-5
[14:59:25] <T13|sleeps> 6pm noe
[14:59:26] <Fusl> yea
[14:59:28] <Velveeta> i thought i was - 5 in central, guess not
[14:59:28] <Fusl> xD
[14:59:28] <javalover> so basically now I just have to make it so you can't click till it loads...
[14:59:53] <T13|sleeps> Nope.  I'm in est its '5
[14:59:56] <Fusl> ah, there we go: [20:19:31] <Guest65124> anyone there able to help with pushState/popState events ?
[15:00:05] <Velveeta> that's the conversation
[15:00:07] <Fusl> well... i'll read it
[15:00:09] <Fusl> :)
[15:00:17] <dblosevn> sorry, I move too much confizzled its -5 now
[15:01:06] <dblosevn> I bounce all around the country im lucky to know what timezone im in lmao much less the offset
[15:01:37] <dblosevn> just got back from minneapolis, dc in 2 weeks then back to minneapolis for a couple months
[15:01:38] <Fusl> i'm in gmt+1 / cet
[15:02:00] <Velveeta> and being an american, i don't pay much attention to gmt, i'm in my own closed off island network of eastern - pacific
[15:02:24] <Fusl> We seem to have missed the gist of that gist you were looking for. :(
[15:02:32] <dblosevn> so substract 6 8:19 - 11:03 CET
[15:02:47] <Velveeta> i'm supposed to be going out to chennai india for one of our offices sometime in the next few months, i'm not looking forward to that flight
[15:03:21] <dblosevn> im supossed to go to brazil sometime in the next 3 months Im looking forward to that flight lmao
[15:04:04] <dblosevn> much needed break with a little work in between :-)
[15:04:19] <nicholasschulz> hmm.. i have a parent div with an id, and when i hover it i want to show the child div… i have all the hover/mouseover set up, so the only thing i am wondering about is how i show the child element?
[15:04:54] <Velveeta> nicholasschulz: .parent .child { display: none; } .parent:hover .child { display: block; } ?
[15:06:57] * Velveeta walks around the room, patting people on the head, saying "duck… duck… duck… duck… duck..."
[15:07:14] <javalover> ummm
[15:07:21] <duckgoose> goose.
[15:07:27] * Velveeta takes off running!
[15:07:57] <dblosevn> or in the hoverin listener... $(this).find('.child').show() ... hoverout $(this).find('.child').hide();
[15:08:17] <dblosevn> and maybe wrap that in a set timeout so it doesnt piss off the user
[15:08:24] <Velveeta> are there hoverin and hoverout events? i always use mouseenter and mouseleave
[15:08:34] <dblosevn> `api hover
[15:08:34] <b-ot> dblosevn: .hover(): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[15:08:55] <Velveeta> oh ok, you're talking about just passing both the callbacks to the hover event
[15:08:57] <nicholasschulz> Velveeta i am using click() … i mentioned wrong earlier, sorry.
[15:09:05] <Velveeta> i think that ends up using mouseenter and mouseleave internally
[15:09:16] <dblosevn> does it all in one, .hover(function() { //hoverin }, function() {// hover out })
[15:09:18] <nicholasschulz> but the same applies though.. except that i don't need timeout
[15:09:40] <Velveeta> dblosevn: right, i thought you were actually binding to a hoverin and hoverout event, i was like "i didn't know jquery published those"
[15:09:53] <dblosevn> and yes it maps the internally to mouseenter, mouseleave
[15:10:27] <Velveeta> nicholasschulz: you could just have your click add an extra class to the parent, and set your css up to be like .parent .child { display: none; } .parent.extraClass .child { display: block; } also
[15:10:32] <dblosevn> the only depressing thing is you cant create a delegated listener using .hover
[15:10:56] <Velveeta> dblosevn's method would work as well, you can do it with just js by hiding and showing the element, or you can do it with targeted css and just have the js add and remove the class name
[15:12:30] <dblosevn> that requires some more code... $('#menu', 'li.parent').on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(e) { if (e.type == 'mouseneter') { } else { } });
[15:13:27] <dblosevn> but it would delegate all li.parents in the future and existing now that are children of #menu :-)
[15:13:32] <Velveeta> rightio
[15:14:06] <dblosevn> oops... $('#menu').on('mouseenter mouseleave', 'li.parent', function....
[15:14:32] <Velveeta> yeah, close enough, i saw what you were goin for ;)
[15:15:51] <dblosevn> I use $(selector, parent) a lot using jquery mobile to prevent acidental collisions of ids or matching elements on another page by acident
[15:16:38] <dblosevn> cant even begin to remember all the nightmares I have had with that lol
[15:18:54] <duckgoose> collisions of ids? o__O
[15:19:01] <duckgoose> how can that even happen
[15:19:42] <Velveeta> i'm guessing in his mobile setup, as new page content is loaded, old page content is just hidden vs scrapped, that sort of thing
[15:19:47] <dblosevn> jquery mobile loads all pages you click into the dom, if 2 pages happen to have a #header $('#header') would match the first page likely hidden in the dom
[15:20:01] <Velveeta> so if the new page is using duplicate components with their own predefined id's, you could end up with duplicate id's in existence
[15:20:08] <Velveeta> right, like that
[15:20:37] <Velveeta> don't css engines stop matching at the first id match though also? if you use the hashtag selector?
[15:20:58] <Velveeta> if you use something like [id="myId"] i think it'll match all, but i want to say #myId only matches the first element in the dom for styling purposes
[15:21:42] <dblosevn> but $(selector, jQuery.mobile.getActivePage()).html('changed') would actually target selector on the visible page
[15:22:08] <dblosevn> I usally store a reference to the active page though to save the funtion call
[15:22:53] <dblosevn> and also try to avaoid duplicate ids on multiple pages :-) because thats just dirty
[15:23:23] <dblosevn> now that I have gotten stronger in dom maniulation its rare I even use ids anymore
[15:24:16] <tw2113> IDs are great for performance
[15:24:16] <Velveeta> right, when dealing with reusable components, it gets more difficult, but in those situations, i tend to not use id's, just class selectors, for the situations where N number of those components may be present
[15:24:21] <tw2113> much faster selector
[15:24:41] <tw2113> don't hate the ID
[15:25:03] <Velveeta> i don't hate the id, i just make sure that if it's used, it's used for an only-ever-one-of kind of situation :)
[15:25:13] <Velveeta> for a reusable component, it's reusable for a reason, so it shouldn't use id's
[15:25:49] <Velveeta> and unless you're doing thousands of dom parsing operations per second or something, the performance gain between id's vs classes is generally negligable
[15:25:50] <tw2113> put IDs on the wrapper area
[15:25:59] <tw2113> eliminate most of the dom around the area you're targeting
[15:26:01] <javalover> Velveeta
[15:26:06] <javalover> so I got it working & it's wonderful
[15:26:10] <javalover> theres just 1 issue
[15:26:12] <Velveeta> tw2113: right, i definitely try to scope my parsing operations when i can
[15:26:20] <Velveeta> javalover: what's the issue?
[15:26:29] <javalover> one of my scripts, it took a while to load & I think my function skipped it like "well we called it good enough"
[15:26:45] <javalover> because wheN i went to the file, then it would always load from temp memory
[15:27:02] <javalover> but say I empty my cache, then it won't load...so is there a way to check?
[15:27:20] <Velveeta> sure, you can open a browser tab directly to the url you're trying to load that script from
[15:27:26] <Velveeta> could be that you have a typo in the url or something
[15:27:36] <javalover> no the url is fine..it's the load time
[15:27:40] <javalover> the file is the last one in the loop
[15:27:45] <dblosevn> also another reason for using selector,parent it doesnt have to parse the whole dom it only parses the dom starting from parent :-) faster selectors
[15:27:48] <Velveeta> how long is it taking to load?
[15:27:49] <javalover> and I think it's not recognizing a full load of it before executing the main
[15:27:58] <Fusl> dblosevn: "you have to watch for locationChange" - how?
[15:28:12] <javalover> when I loaded it my internet was slow so it took like 10 seconds
[15:28:20] <javalover> but if I try on my site it's instant
[15:28:31] <dblosevn> I usually use hashchange honestly when I am trying to make a 100% clientside solution
[15:28:35] <javalover> so I think it's just skipping even if it doesn't load like "I attempted, good enough"
[15:28:38] <dblosevn> `g hashchange
[15:28:40] <b-ot> dblosevn: Ben Alman » jQuery hashchange event → http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[15:28:45] <Velveeta> fusl: you can use dirty checking of the url, like set up a timed interval to check the url constantly and see when it changes, then trigger a callback
[15:28:47] <datarecal> i have a group of select boxes in a div is it possible to get jquery to determine if the one being changed is the first on ?
[15:28:50] <datarecal> one*
[15:28:52] * Fusl hates hashchange :/
[15:28:54] <Fusl> *still*
[15:29:05] <dblosevn> because otherwise you need server sided code to make it happen with real urls
[15:29:23] <Fusl> Velveeta: yeah but that does not prevent firefox/chrome/whatever from loading the new url, even when it's on the same server
[15:29:24] <Velveeta> javalover: 10 seconds isn't too long to a browser as far as it abandoning a resource load, i think even a low-end timeout is usually at least 30 seconds
[15:29:27] <dblosevn> premalinks will fail without using hashchange or serversided code eg mod rewrite etc
[15:29:46] <Fusl> i just want to catch location changes and load them via ajax if the hostname is the same
[15:29:48] <Velveeta> fusl: well if you don't want it to load the new url, you need to use hash changes
[15:29:55] <Fusl> damn :/
[15:30:10] <Fusl> but why?
[15:30:13] <Velveeta> or else attach click listeners to all of your anchors and prevent their default from triggering, and then ajax load their url
[15:30:18] <Fusl> hash(changes) would not work with legacy browsers
[15:30:22] <Fusl> without javascript
[15:30:29] <dblosevn> Fusl: you dont have to you can use real urls and just push/pop them
[15:30:37] <Velveeta> it won't work with modern browsers without javascript either
[15:30:45] <Velveeta> if you're trying to ajax load url changes, that's javascript
[15:31:09] <dblosevn> Fusl: but, you loose the ability to create permalinks
[15:31:12] <javalover> well i'm using .getScript()  how do I know if it really got the script?
[15:31:35] <Fusl> dblosevn: http://185.27.253.87:4444/ those permalinks work fine
[15:31:38] <Velveeta> javalover: getScript returns a jquery promise object that you can attach a callback to
[15:31:42] <Fusl> until you change the url
[15:31:59] <dblosevn> javalover: use the callback... $.getScript('js/myscript.js', function() { console.log('loaded') } )
[15:32:57] <dblosevn> also as Velveeta mentioned $.getScript('js/myscript.js').done(function() {}).error(function() {}).always(function() {});
[15:33:14] <javalover> hmm perhaps the .done
[15:33:41] <Velveeta> they're functionally equivalent, so either method should work
[15:33:49] <dblosevn> .done is success, .error is a load or script error after load, .always always is triggered no matter the failure
[15:34:42] <dblosevn> .done yay, .error try to recover, .always continue loading scripts if possible
[15:35:30] <Velveeta> i use a lot of promise objects in my unit tests so that i can .stop() the test engine upon enterring a test module, and .start() it in the .always() call of my $.when'd promises
[15:35:35] <Velveeta> if that makes sense :D
[15:36:06] <dblosevn> .when im .stop ed I will not .run :-)
[15:37:20] <Velveeta> well i have N number of asynchronous operations that run within a test module, so i can't have the engine continuing until they're all done, so i .stop() it first, run all of those operations as deferreds, build a master deferred by running them through $.when, and when they're all resolved or rejected, the $.when.always() handler .starts() the test engine again
[15:37:37] <dblosevn> ya ive been using promises and deferreds a lot lately and have come to like them a lot, phonegap is really async heavy as all native ops are processed async, so promises are a godsend
[15:38:05] <Velveeta> definitely, once i wrapped my head around deferred objects, i started using them all over the place
[15:38:18] <Velveeta> refactored all kinds of old timeout code to use them and sped things up incredibly
[15:39:27] <javalover> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'done' of undefined
[15:39:40] <Velveeta> javalover: show us a code sample
[15:40:01] <javalover> $.getScript(names[i],realCallback)
[15:40:06] <javalover> I had this & tried to convert
[15:40:29] <Velveeta> ok, and what did you try to convert to?
[15:40:36] <dblosevn> oops .error is invalid, .fail
[15:41:01] <javalover> $.getScript(names[i]).done()
[15:41:07] <javalover> or well better than that
[15:41:12] <Velveeta> i was gonna say something when you mentioned .error vs .fail earlier, but i couldn't remember if they also aliased .error to .fail, so i held my tongue
[15:41:49] <dblosevn> to me it would have been better if it was aliased as well as .success for done
[15:42:03] <dblosevn> then it would line up more nicely with extjs,
[15:42:05] <javalover> so wait they changed it then?
[15:42:09] <javalover> or is .done still supposed tow ork?
[15:42:22] <Velveeta> javalover: what version of jquery are you running?
[15:42:24] <dblosevn> no I just goofed. .done is right .error is wrong
[15:42:28] <javalover> 1.9
[15:42:37] <Velveeta> dblosevn: yeah, i could have sworn i read that they did that in the src somewhere
[15:42:57] <Velveeta> i guess it's just the success/error callback options that are aliased to done/fail
[15:43:11] <Velveeta> hmmm, 1.9 should easily support those deferred returns
[15:43:20] <javalover> oh wait
[15:43:24] <javalover> I think I see the issue now
[15:43:25] <Velveeta> and the API page does show a sample usage of $.getScript(url).done
[15:43:32] <dblosevn> `api jquery.getscript @ javalover
[15:43:32] <b-ot> javalover: jQuery.getScript(): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[15:43:54] <dblosevn> look at handling errors, it shows how to use the promoise it returns
[15:46:47] <dblosevn> Velveeta:  I just wrote a small test script and both .error and .success are undefined so I guess it was a goof :-(
[15:47:07] <Velveeta> maybe in a future release
[15:47:15] <Velveeta> i've gotten into the habit of done and fail anyway :)
[15:47:31] <dblosevn> ya, but then I try using done/fail in ext lol
[15:48:32] <javalover> wait reals?
[15:48:40] <dblosevn> although lately I have been using the jquery adapter got ext and mainly using the jquery api and only the components of ext im really selecting
[15:48:43] <dblosevn> javalover: 1.9
[15:48:46] <dblosevn> sorry
[15:48:48] <dblosevn> 1.0
[15:49:32] <javalover> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'done' of undefined
[15:49:32] <dblosevn> .getScript is just a shortcut method for .ajax and returns the promise from .ajax
[15:49:47] <javalover> so weird
[15:50:11] <Velveeta> show us the actual code block in a pastebin or something at least
[15:50:20] <dblosevn> I bet I know what hes doing
[15:50:33] <javalover>  $.getScript(names[i]).done(function() {
[15:50:34] <javalover>     alert( "$.get failed!" );
[15:50:34] <javalover>   });
[15:50:36] <javalover> wtf lol
[15:50:37] <dblosevn> hes calling done like its a function
[15:50:49] <dblosevn> or not lol
[15:51:04] <dblosevn> possibly names[i] is undefined
[15:51:10] <javalover> hows that even possible?
[15:51:18] <dblosevn> breaking getscript hence breaking the promise
[15:51:25] <Velveeta> javalover: in the future, don't paste your code blocks into the room, paste them on a site that's designed for that (pastebin, jsbin, jsfiddle, etc) and give us the url to it
[15:51:38] <dblosevn> +1
[15:51:45] <Velveeta> that's why i'd asked his jquery version, in case it was < 1.5
[15:51:54] <Velveeta> but at 1.9, that block should work just fine
[15:52:20] <dblosevn> I thought this was in since 1.0, didnt realize there were any changes since then to this method
[15:52:45] <Velveeta> 1.5 is when deferreds first rolled out, so it would have had to have been at least that version
[15:52:51] <Velveeta> but yeah, he said he's at 1.9
[15:53:00] <Velveeta> so now i'm baffled
[15:53:04] <dblosevn> oh true, go ya
[15:53:14] <Velveeta> i don't suppose that's on a public url anywhere to be seen?
[15:53:31] <dblosevn> I just did this in my console $.getScript().done(function(){}) and it didnt error at all
[15:53:45] <dblosevn> returned a promise
[15:53:50] <Velveeta> right, as it should
[15:53:56] <javalover> I agree
[15:54:21] <javalover> wait did you put a string in there?
[15:55:14] <javalover> $.getScript("http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js").done(function() {    alert( "$.get failed!" );  });
[15:55:17] <dblosevn> I didnt because I didnt want to load  a script but I would have if I did want to load a script
[15:55:44] <javalover> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'done' of undefined
[15:55:47] <Velveeta> javalover: what happens if you do this: console.log($.getScript("http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js"));
[15:56:09] <dblosevn> it worked for me
[15:56:17] <dblosevn> verbatium on 1.7.1
[15:56:18] <javalover> undefined
[15:56:25] <javalover> maybe
[15:56:35] <javalover> like my jquery hmm perhaps noconflict
[15:56:47] <Velveeta> are you running other versions of jquery?
[15:56:57] <javalover> i'm not but
[15:56:58] <javalover> idk
[15:57:02] <dblosevn> I try to always use jQuery, or alias jQuery in an IIFE
[15:57:30] <Velveeta> yeah i typically surround my jquery blocks in an IIFE that i pass it into by name, so i can use $ without fear of conflicts
[15:57:33] <javalover> why would this work $.getScript("file.js",myfunction);
[15:57:37] <javalover> but then not the other way wtf
[15:57:40] <dblosevn> I dont like $ even though its short and sweet too many other script try to hijack $
[15:57:55] <javalover> so call it using jQuery()?
[15:58:01] <Velveeta> (function ($) { }(jQuery)); <-- problem solved
[15:58:22] <dblosevn> +1 exactly what I said lol
[15:59:04] <javalover> okay that fixed
[15:59:06] <javalover> for whatever reason
[15:59:15] <dblosevn> and if that line works javalover your not really using 1.9
[15:59:27] <javalover> no i just used jQuery.
[15:59:39] <javalover> idk it's a big website that loads multiple things
[15:59:39] <dblosevn> ya you got a conflict somewhere
[15:59:43] <javalover> perhaps in the main file I have a conflict
[15:59:48] <Velveeta> if switching to jQuery() worked, then you must have another library loading that's taking over $
[15:59:54] <dblosevn> and most likely its loading multiple versions of jquery
[16:00:02] <javalover> yeah that's my whole goal for today anyway
[16:00:06] <javalover> to go over all this & fix it's organiziation
[16:00:09] <javalover> so atleast I know this now
[16:00:15] <Velveeta> that's why you should always do that sort of thing that dblosevn and i just said, wrapping it in a closure to contain and localize your variable scope
[16:00:18] <dblosevn> console.log($.fn.jquery);console.log(jQuery.fn.jqueyr);
[16:00:36] <dblosevn> crap console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery);
[16:00:46] <javalover> what willt his do hmm lets find out
[16:00:56] <dblosevn> Ill bet both thoughs output different versions
[16:01:02] <Velveeta> right
[16:01:13] <javalover> that's awesome that you can check this
[16:01:20] <javalover> you guys are awesome  thx so much for the help
[16:01:52] <javalover> wanna hear something amazing
[16:02:04] <javalover> I have a 1.4 logged somewhere
[16:02:11] <Velveeta> that would explain it
[16:02:18] <Velveeta> that's probably the one taking the $ namespace
[16:02:19] <javalover> but hey atleast we figured it out haha
[16:02:23] <Velveeta> yep
[16:02:31] <javalover> imma hold onto those, very useful functions
[16:02:57] <javalover> i dropped in a function called checkJquery();
[16:06:03] <javalover> sooo wtf .fail
[16:06:04] <javalover> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js
[16:06:08] <javalover> failed to load this apparently
[16:06:41] <dblosevn> javalover: in the code you have been pasting us your putting $.get failed in the success callback
[16:07:01] <dblosevn> .done means all is well so I think you have it backwards
[16:07:16] <javalover> nvm
[16:07:18] <javalover> i'm dumb
[16:07:36] <javalover> i didn't wrap it in a fucntion so it just console.logged
[16:07:40] <javalover> i think it works now haha
[16:41:05] <dreamingrainbow> hello everyone, I could use some help with this, I have checked it and its valid code but i dont understand why its not working. http://jsfiddle.net/Q6gBd/
[16:41:36] <Velveeta> where are you triggering a 'ready' event?
[16:42:10] <Velveeta> $('.checked').on('ready', function (e) {
[16:42:47] <dreamingrainbow> well i have tried on('load' ... with no avail
[16:43:09] <Velveeta> you have that inside of a document.ready function, at that time, those items will be loaded.. unless i'm missing something
[16:43:32] <dreamingrainbow> no i probly am. I am so new to jquery,
[16:43:44] <Velveeta> how about i ask this: what's the *intended* functionality here?
[16:44:52] <dreamingrainbow> the code inside the $('.active').on('', function...
[16:45:04] <dreamingrainbow> needs to run when the document is ready
[16:45:56] <Velveeta> i think this is what you're looking for then: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6gBd/2/
[16:47:20] <dreamingrainbow> close http://jsfiddle.net/Q6gBd/3/ you can see the issue
[16:48:07] <Velveeta> i'm not sure i do.. i'm still not clear on exactly what this code should do...
[16:48:11] <dreamingrainbow> it should remove the red-border class and does not
[16:48:14] <Velveeta> you're adding a red-border class on the 3rd item
[16:48:43] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: that code looks relatively familiar lol
[16:48:51] <dblosevn> what are you trying to do with it now?
[16:49:08] <dreamingrainbow> hey dblosevn
[16:49:21] <dblosevn> sup
[16:49:23] <dreamingrainbow> the original code we worked on is great
[16:49:35] <dreamingrainbow> the problem lie when we have an error
[16:49:46] <dreamingrainbow> and the form returns, I need to populate
[16:50:26] <Velveeta> so, your code there should find all *checked* class items of the same data-group, and remove their red border
[16:50:37] <Velveeta> the problem with that 3rd element you added is that it has the red-border class, but not the checked class
[16:50:43] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6gBd/5/
[16:50:49] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/Q6gBd/6/
[16:50:51] <dreamingrainbow> and then add the red border back to only the active one
[16:51:07] <dblosevn> should have targeted .sel not .checked when reseting the class
[16:51:09] <Velveeta> right, but the problem is that you didn't include the checked class in your 3rd element, so it doesn't match your selector
[16:51:27] <dblosevn> no the orginal selector is right
[16:51:30] <Velveeta> yeah, what dblosevn said
[16:51:34] <dblosevn> the selector in g is wrong
[16:51:44] <Velveeta> right
[16:52:28] <dreamingrainbow> thanks
[16:52:30] <dreamingrainbow> thats it
[16:52:45] <dreamingrainbow> thank you both, it will now be awesome ...
[16:53:27] <Velveeta> teh awesomest
[16:54:15] <dblosevn> :-)
[17:07:30] <javalover> wtf
[17:07:38] <Velveeta> wtf indeed
[17:07:45] <javalover> oh wait
[17:07:47] <javalover> i just figured it out
[17:07:51] <Velveeta> phew!
[17:07:58] <javalover> soooooo i've changed it for the new document
[17:08:01] <javalover> but i haven't changed it for the old one
[17:08:06] <javalover> so A is still loading B
[17:08:10] <javalover> and inside A we still have async
[17:08:21] <javalover> so now I gotta fix A
[17:08:29] <javalover> to prove this i'll simply load B
[17:08:44] <dblosevn> I think you should load Z just for the hell of it
[17:09:06] <javalover> good idea lol
[17:09:08] <javalover> no but I get it
[17:09:19] <javalover> it's very wierd how this all works i'm like "i fixed itcmonnnn" andt hen nope
[17:09:31] <javalover> but I think I did fix it, just not all of it
[17:09:36] <Velveeta> it gets easier with experience
[17:09:42] <javalover> yeah haha
[17:09:51] <javalover> had I known I woulda started like this but i've been working with errors
[17:09:54] <javalover> and just going "i'll fix it later"
[17:09:55] <dblosevn> for some, others get worse over time :-P
[17:10:08] <Velveeta> i don't know how many people i've seen come in here with an attitude like "agh! javascript sucks, it's not working!" and you realize they're trying to do something completely off the wall
[17:10:21] <javalover> I never think something doesn't work
[17:10:26] <javalover> I always think "it can I just don't know how"
[17:10:42] <javalover> that's why I'm just asking & posting code cuz I like group think
[17:11:04] <Velveeta> i had to write a couple of papers on groupthink and group dynamics back in college
[17:11:05] <javalover> what's weird is even someone who doesn't know how to code, they can help if I just bounce the problem off of them
[17:11:09] <Velveeta> based on a couple of movies
[17:11:18] <Velveeta> one of those movies was pitch black, which was awesome to analyze
[17:11:32] <javalover> good movie?
[17:11:39] <Velveeta> the other was fight club, which was a little wonky, since the group was governed in 2 separate ways by 2 different characters that happened to be the same person
[17:11:49] <Velveeta> yeah i love all those riddick movies :D
[17:11:57] <javalover> oh i've seen riddick
[17:12:06] <Velveeta> i still haven't seen the latest riddick
[17:12:21] <javalover> dang...well bathroom break but
[17:12:23] <gordian> not missing much
[17:12:31] <javalover> again thx for all the help you guys :-)
[17:12:37] <Velveeta> no problemo
[17:12:39] <javalover> and to add to velveeta
[17:12:47] <javalover> i personally believe saw movies sucked cuz bad group think
[17:13:05] <Velveeta> saw movies as in the ones with jigsaw the villain?
[17:13:21] <Velveeta> those are some of my favorite movies ever, jigsaw is probably in my top 3 favorite movie villains ever :D
[17:13:40] <Velveeta> even when they got corny when they were on saw 37 or whatever they topped out on, i still loved the death machines :D
[17:14:11] <dblosevn> gah ive been screwing with my desk all afternoon and still cant get it right, somebody decided to move into my space while I was out of town the last time, cant quite figure out whats wrong lol
[17:15:02] <Velveeta> dblosevn: did they do this? http://www.buzzfeed.com/aaronc13/this-is-how-you-grow-the-best-prank-ever
[17:15:12] <dblosevn> Ive got 4 monitors and it minorly difficult to get them all in a position to not have much bezel and still be able to see all of them
[17:15:16] <Velveeta> because if they did, i think i have an idea what might still be wrong
[17:17:01] <dblosevn> not quite, there were like 10 laptops in various stages of disassembly, all my monitors were shifted, my chair was broken took me like an hour before I could get my chair fixed and my workstation setup so I could work again and its still not right
[17:17:33] <Velveeta> gross.. who the hell temporarily takes over a work area and fucks it up that much?
[17:18:07] <dblosevn> well I dont pay for my space so I guess there allowed lol, all my equipment is mine but I trade for ofice aspace
[17:18:15] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, bam. check it out
[17:18:24] <Velveeta> cryp71c: is it pushed public?
[17:18:55] <dblosevn> local pc repair shop that doesnt really have the cash to pay for help, so I sit in the office and handle customers while hes out on service calls and stuff and I get free space :-)
[17:18:58] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, yep. the key on the right still doesn't update; but everything uses client side templates and json + javascript to update.
[17:19:06] <Velveeta> nice, let me take a look
[17:19:12] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, after you request a timeline once, its stored in js and isn't called again.
[17:19:24] <Velveeta> perfect
[17:19:49] <Cryp71c> Without compression on, each request was ~500k, but I also turned on gzip and now each request is ~80k
[17:20:29] <Velveeta> cryp71c: that's lookin great now! :)
[17:20:39] <dblosevn> so its win win, he has somebody in the office and I have somewhere to call the office and dont have to work from home and be annoyed lol
[17:20:40] <Velveeta> and those transfer sizes are perfectly reasonable now
[17:20:52] <Cryp71c> Thanks again, just wanted to pop by.
[17:21:05] <Velveeta> dblosevn: i'm trying to remember what that's called, but i'm 4 beers in and my brain is having a hard time digging it up
[17:21:20] <Velveeta> cryp71c: not a problem, glad you were able to get it all sorted out so well :)
[17:22:04] <dblosevn> not to mention the store is only like 2 miles from my house lol
[17:22:44] <Velveeta> "coworking" i think is the term i'm looking for
[17:24:16] <dblosevn> dunno lol, hes got some cool stuff going on too were about to start a WISP
[17:24:56] <dblosevn> already got a 9 mile 300mbps backhual up peered with 100mbps full duplex fibre
[17:25:30] <Velveeta> nice
[17:26:15] <dblosevn> ya were still playing with it though, trying to get our end of the link up higher so its not affected by terain as much
[17:26:53] <dblosevn> at about 40 feet on our end, 110 on the other, trying to bring it up to around 80 on this side
[17:39:51] <paissad> hello guys, i would like to have the same template page as twitter page (as an example) by using bootstrap & jquery ... i googled a bit, but i always see templates that suit much more for blogs, but not for something like the twitter page
[17:40:01] <paissad> may someone help me to find what i need please ? thanks in advance
[17:42:56] <Velveeta> when you say template page, do you mean layout?
[17:43:01] <paissad> yes layout
[17:43:17] <Velveeta> http://www.templatemonster.com/
[17:43:35] <paissad> Velveeta, thanks mate
[17:43:43] <Velveeta> that's outside of the scope of this channel, but there's someplace you can start looking
[17:45:23] <paissad> i tried to joint #bootstrap, but that channel is invite only
[17:46:04] <Velveeta> well, bootstrap wouldn't be able to help you with this either
[17:46:27] <Velveeta> these are just tools in putting together your own website, but you seem to have a specific design in mind, which is outside the scope of these channels
[17:46:57] <Velveeta> you might want to consider hiring yourself a developer/designer to put together the layout you're looking for
[17:54:27] <randomdrake> t
[17:54:34] <Velveeta> q
[18:00:22] <Velveeta> we had a nerdgirl_ in here? O_o
[18:00:48] * Velveeta licks his palm, smooths back his hair, adjusts his bowtie, and checks his pocket protector.
[18:05:22] <oliwe> if i ease in something with easeInSine and want to continue with a linear at the same ending speed as the easein ended at
[18:05:27] <oliwe> whats an easy solution
[18:05:39] <oliwe> i guess this is a math question really
[18:07:25] <Velveeta> oliwe: this might help you to quickly and easily identify the inverse of that, or whatever easing you want to continue with: http://easings.net/
[18:07:57] <Velveeta> i've had that bookmarked for some time, but it's the first time i've been able to throw it out for someone :D
[18:08:20] <Velveeta> at a glance, it looks like easeOutSine would be the way to go
[18:08:35] <oliwe> yeah thats not really the issue though
[18:08:36] <oliwe> like
[18:08:48] <oliwe> if i do easeInSine - linear - easeOutSine
[18:08:55] <oliwe> how do i know how fast my linear should go
[18:09:00] <oliwe> to fit the speed of those two
[18:09:11] <Velveeta> ahhh i think i see what you're asking
[18:09:32] <Velveeta> you need to mathematically figure out the speed of the end of the easeInSine, based on its total time interval, and match that speed in a linear easing, right?
[18:09:39] <oliwe> yeah
[18:09:42] <oliwe> exactly
[18:09:52] <Velveeta> yeah that's beyond my math lernin'z :D
[18:09:57] <oliwe> haha yeah same
[18:10:48] <Velveeta> i would probably just hunt for a "good enough" speed
[18:10:58] <oliwe> yeah im doing a guesstimate right now
[18:11:02] <Velveeta> to the human eye, you can just get close enough, and people aren't gonna notice
[18:11:32] <Velveeta> this site might help to find the actual mathematical formulas behind those easings: http://www.gizma.com/easing/
[18:12:29] <oliwe> yeah that looks nice, thanks
[18:12:51] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org/rolig/
[18:12:53] <oliwe> having a bit of fun
[18:13:22] <Velveeta> come on big money!
[18:13:25] <oliwe> haha
[18:13:37] <oliwe> im going to do a ajax call to a website that does "true random"
[18:13:59] <oliwe> so that it keeps spinning while loading
[18:15:36] <oliwe> but its a bit weird right now, it kinda speeds up during the start sometimes
[18:17:30] <Velveeta> woo hoo! i can hit 500 on every spin now! thanks, javascript skills! :D
[18:17:38] <oliwe> haha
[18:17:48] <Velveeta> random.org?
[18:17:51] <oliwe> ye
[18:17:54] <Velveeta> nice
[18:18:10] <freebirD2> hi, I'm loading a form with ajax, and in some cases I would like to validate an input using max, and someother cases not, how do I make an inline validation for one input, please ??
[18:19:15] <Velveeta> freebird2: when you say "loading a form with ajax" do you mean "submitting a form with ajax"?
[18:20:14] <freebirD2> Velveeta, no, I mean the ajax is loading some inputs
[18:20:30] <freebirD2> I choose a product in a select, and it loads the value input,
[18:20:38] <Velveeta> ok, so then after they're loaded, you just want to validate using some custom function?
[18:20:46] <freebirD2> I would like to apply a jquery style to that input
[18:21:02] <Velveeta> the style will be based on the validation state or what?
[18:21:43] <xqo> how can you use names from different files like you can with jquery? if i defined myObject in file1.js, what do i need to do to make new myObject possible in file2.js?
[18:21:52] <freebirD2> Velveeta, not sure, it's an input, and sometimes can't have a number greather than 10, that's all
[18:23:39] <Velveeta> xqo: you'd have to put the variable in the global (window) namespace
[18:23:50] <xqo> Velveeta how do i do that?
[18:23:55] <Velveeta> freebird2: do you have a validation function set up for the form at all currently?
[18:24:02] <freebirD2> yeahh
[18:24:04] <freebirD2> Velveeta,
[18:24:17] <Velveeta> xwo: you can do something like this: window.myVar = window.myVar || "some initial value";
[18:24:30] <Velveeta> if window.myVar exists, it will use the existing value, otherwise, it will create the initial value
[18:24:54] <Velveeta> freebird2: then you should just be able to add a rule into that validation function, for the field in question, to verify it's <= 10, whenever that rule is valid
[18:25:04] <freebirD2> Velveeta, hmm, but where ?
[18:25:14] <Velveeta> freebird2: in your existing validation function
[18:27:15] <oliwe> can you animate stuff to go in a bow?
[18:27:26] <Velveeta> a bow?
[18:27:28] <oliwe> yeah like
[18:27:31] <Velveeta> like a figure 8 kind of thing?
[18:27:31] <oliwe> (
[18:27:57] <oliwe> i kinda want coins to pop out from behind the spin button when you win big
[18:28:10] <oliwe> but it looks kinda tacky if they are just going in direct lines
[18:28:18] <Velveeta> oh i see what you're saying
[18:28:37] <Velveeta> yes, you can create your own animate function, and mathematically evaluate the step algorithm 
[18:29:03] <oliwe> actually i think i just solved it
[18:29:04] <freebirD2> Velveeta, is it possible some how to call an eventListener right under the input with a max validation ?
[18:29:12] <oliwe> i can do two animate events on same item right?
[18:29:39] <Velveeta> oliwe: sure, but they may conflict and have that thing bouncing all over the place if their algorithms aren't in sequence with each other
[18:29:50] <freebirD2> Velveeta, http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/13Y3
[18:29:57] <freebirD2> this I hwo I'm trying, working now,
[18:29:59] <oliwe> wait ill try it out
[18:30:12] <Velveeta> freebird2: the physical place in the dom that the event listener lives doesn't really matter, but you'd want to evaluate it either on blur or on submit
[18:30:16] <Velveeta> i'll take a look at that paste
[18:30:31] <freebirD2> tks a lot Velveeta
[18:31:46] <Velveeta> freebird2: yeah, something like that should work fine, though i would personally convert some of that to jquery :)
[18:31:59] <Velveeta> especially the addEventListener, which won't work in legacy IE
[18:32:12] <freebirD2> really ? why
[18:32:13] <freebirD2> suckss
[18:32:32] <Velveeta> because older IE uses attachEventListener, not addEventListener
[18:32:42] <Velveeta> that's part of the reason for using jquery, it normalizes that interface for you
[18:32:58] <Velveeta> you just use .on(), and it internally checks which function it should use to attach the event listener
[18:38:03] <freebirD2> Velveeta, I thought about something, I'm echooing the js validation from the ajax, but wont work, like this, is it wrong  ? http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/13Y4
[18:38:56] <Velveeta> is this the only thing that's returned with that ajax request?
[18:39:33] <freebirD2> Velveeta, no
[18:39:46] <Velveeta> so it's a mix of markup and that script tag?
[18:40:01] <freebirD2> http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/13Y5
[18:40:12] <freebirD2> Velveeta, it's in there
[18:40:17] <Velveeta> gotcha
[18:40:38] <Velveeta> so, i'm pretty sure jquery strips out javascript in a consumable html response, unless you pass a certain flag to the ajax request: evalScripts
[18:40:45] <paissad> do you guys have a special lib or plugin related to jquery you would recommend me for consuming a REST API ?
[18:41:05] <freebirD2> I see,
[18:41:07] <Velveeta> and even that looks to be an outdated flag
[18:41:41] <paissad> i already wrote the server side api with jax-rs ... but i now have to write a client interface for that API
[18:41:50] <Velveeta> paissad: rest is just a philosphy of consuming your endpoint, standard ajax functions should work fine
[18:41:59] <paissad> hmmm
[18:42:01] <paissad> ok
[18:42:56] <freebirD2> Velveeta, should I set evalScripts:true in the script ?
[18:43:21] <Velveeta> freebird2: i just checked the api docs and it looks to be deprecated
[18:43:30] <Velveeta> let me read the source code real quick, what version are you running?
[18:44:48] <freebirD2> tksss
[18:44:51] <freebirD2> of what ?
[18:44:55] <freebirD2> jquery ?
[18:44:58] <Velveeta> yep
[18:45:40] <freebirD2> latest
[18:45:49] <Velveeta> ok
[18:47:02] <freebirD2> tks
[18:49:57] <Velveeta> freebird2: ok, probably the easier way of figuring out if it's removing script tags or not is to just add something to your script output, like "alert('hello');" and see if it pops up an alert box
[18:50:19] <freebirD2> it's there already
[18:50:32] <freebirD2> when in the main file, works ok, when I load using ajax, wont work
[18:50:42] <Velveeta> ok, so it sounds like it's being removed then
[18:53:14] <freebirD2> weird
[18:53:35] <Velveeta> can you add a breakpoint to your ajax success function and console.log() the response from the server?
[18:54:01] <freebirD2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/978101/how-to-execute-javascript-inside-a-script-tag-returned-by-an-ajax-response
[18:54:04] <freebirD2> check this Velveeta
[18:54:13] <freebirD2> I don't even know what a breakpoint is, lool
[18:54:49] <Velveeta> so, the problem in your case is that you have mixed html and script tags
[18:54:59] <Velveeta> can you show me a paste of your ajax request itself?
[18:56:46] <freebirD2> sure,
[18:57:20] <freebirD2> http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/13Y7
[18:57:26] <freebirD2> what about the eval, check this
[18:57:50] <Velveeta> so you can't straight up eval your response, because it's a mix of html and script right?
[18:58:12] <Velveeta> oh what the fuck, you're not using jquery for your ajax request?
[18:58:53] <freebirD2> http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/error
[18:59:23] <Velveeta> that paste is just an error
[18:59:25] <freebirD2> http://justpaste.it/saved/3074463/40c94efe
[18:59:28] <freebirD2> sorry
[19:00:28] <Velveeta> so, earlier when i said you should be using jquery to attach your event listeners because it normalizes that interface for you between multple browser versions......
[19:00:44] <Velveeta> well you should *really* be using jquery for your ajax transactions
[19:01:03] <Velveeta> because all that xmlhttpresponse crap is really repetitive
[19:01:08] <freebirD2> I see, I think I'll do something different, too difficult for me, tks for your time
[19:01:15] <Velveeta> alrighty then...
[19:01:16] <freebirD2> I'm very bad with js, need to study more
[19:01:31] <freebirD2> tskss
[19:01:36] <Velveeta> you could take that whole 30 or so lines of js you have in that ajax request, and condense it down to about 5 lines w/ jquery
[19:29:06] <datarecal> i have a group of select boxes in a div is it possible to get jquery to determine if the one being changed is the first one ?
[19:30:42] <Velveeta> sure
[19:31:57] <Velveeta> sorry, got distracted by the wife, didn't mean to say that and stop and sound like a dick :D
[19:32:48] <Velveeta> so, you can do something like this: $('select').on('change', function () { if ($(this).index() === 0) { } });
[19:33:00] <Velveeta> you can also say if ($(this).is(':first')) { }
[19:33:14] <Velveeta> provided that all of those selects are siblings of each other, at the same dom level
[19:35:11] <datarecal> ok ill give it a shot
[19:38:27] <datarecal> Velveeta : http://jsfiddle.net/6X4Lb/1/
[19:38:59] <datarecal> actually : http://jsfiddle.net/6X4Lb/2/
[19:39:28] <datarecal> so what im trying to figure out is if its the select in the first of each div
[19:40:05] <Velveeta> use the .index() method instead, i assumed :first would work, but apparently not
[19:40:09] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/6X4Lb/3/
[19:41:49] <datarecal> perfect index works nicely
[19:41:52] <datarecal> thanks Velveeta
[19:42:27] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[19:44:09] <datarecal> hmm actually when i input it into my real code since its not layed out that nicely index wont work
[19:44:25] <datarecal> they have the same parent but nested div's
[19:49:16] <datarecal> Velveeta with actual html code : http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/6/
[19:52:27] <Velveeta> here you go, just find the closest element that *is* at a sibling level, and use that instead: http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/7/
[20:03:31] <oliwe> hoho this is gonna be fun to code
[20:03:42] <Velveeta> let's do dis!
[20:03:45] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org/rolig
[20:03:46] * Velveeta rubs his hands together.
[20:03:47] <oliwe> added a second wheel
[20:04:05] <Velveeta> i've seen this before… this is the vegas hits slot machine!
[20:04:08] <oliwe> wheen the colors match you wins
[20:04:38] <datarecal> Velveeta is there a way to see which path id the select resides in as well
[20:04:42] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/6IfzAJo.jpg
[20:04:42] <datarecal> path-1 or path-2
[20:05:48] <Velveeta> datarecal: you could always do something like check the id attribute of that parent object, Lander1 or Lander2
[20:06:36] <Velveeta> oliwe: i like it :D
[20:06:48] <datarecal> ok ill give it a shot thanks Velveeta
[20:07:06] <Velveeta> datarecal: good luck
[20:07:11] <quansai> Hey
[20:07:54] <oliwe> Velveeta works on mobile too
[20:08:00] <Velveeta> nice
[20:08:20] <quansai> Is there a way to show a div when a cursor (within a form) is showing in a field?
[20:08:49] <oliwe> hover?
[20:08:53] <quansai> Nope.
[20:08:57] <Velveeta> focus?
[20:09:04] <quansai> The user may just tab into the field.
[20:09:26] <Velveeta> you can set up an event listener for focus, which should work for a programmatic trigger, a tab, or a click
[20:09:37] <Velveeta> $('yourInput').on('focus', function () { } );
[20:09:40] <quansai> focus might work.
[20:09:48] <quansai> Thanks, Velveeta
[20:10:02] <Velveeta> no problemo
[20:20:39] <datarecal> Velveeta $(this).closest('.form-group').parent().parent().attr('id') that works, do you think that is the most efficiant way of doing it ?
[20:21:45] <Velveeta> so you want the grandparent element *of* the form group that identifies which select was changed?
[20:21:58] <Velveeta> because if you go to the grandparent element, you're not clustering select elements under it
[20:22:34] <datarecal> yes
[20:22:52] <datarecal> there will be multiples path's in the html code all containing select's
[20:23:02] <datarecal> so when the select is triggered i need to figure out which grandparent it was
[20:23:47] <Velveeta> so you're only interested in which clustered path was changed?
[20:23:48] <Velveeta> alrighty then, that should be just fine
[20:23:48] <datarecal> ok thanks
[22:35:16] <lemd> i have a horizontal scrolling site and a dynamic div where the width is set by images, problem is that im trying to lazy load the images but it's breaking the calculated width...anyone have any tips?
