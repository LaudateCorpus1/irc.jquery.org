[01:54:11] <joobz> guys I am changing an object's data attribute, to point it to a new SVG via JQuery. Is there a way to run an event after the SVG has rendered? It is taking a little time to render once i change it and want to trigger something at the end
[03:41:47] <pavonia> Is there a way (or a plugin) to create <style> elements dynamically without having to fiddle with pure CSS text? Like the .css() function but directly for CSS rules
[03:41:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[03:43:53] <robertmaxrees> to clarify: there are hacks that get you close, but they're super buggy and inconsistent.  do not use them.
[03:45:19] <pavonia> :D
[03:46:36] <robertmaxrees> is this for more SVG stuff?
[03:47:22] <Translat-Embedde> hii all if i want to make preloader for my website, i can't find on internet when jquery know that preloader will be exit ???
[03:47:33] <pavonia> robertmaxrees: Of course! :)
[03:47:40] <Translat-Embedde> i don't know how to make this
[03:48:01] <robertmaxrees> Translat-Embedde don't make a preloader in the first place.
[03:49:35] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees> and next ?
[03:50:03] <robertmaxrees> Translat-Embedde by "preloader" do you mean some kind of overlay for the site while it loads?
[03:51:04] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees>  yes that exactly
[03:51:38] <robertmaxrees> Translat-Embedde do not do that at all.  those are a very bad idea.
[03:52:44] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees> why ?? because users thinking that website is slow ???
[03:53:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[03:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you're adding in an unnecessary step to users accessing your website.  that's a bad idea.
[03:55:38] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees> ok
[03:56:06] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees> i know that people not like waiting
[03:56:18] <robertmaxrees> right.  so speed up your site.  don't mask the problem.
[03:57:14] <Translat-Embedde> <robertmaxrees>  ok thanks
[03:57:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:51] <pavonia> What was the upwards equivalent of .find()?
[16:03:05] <pavonia> .closest()
