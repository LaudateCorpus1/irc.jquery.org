[10:45:51] <IHasFingers> hi guys i have a js file which has https://kopy.io/xyNEj which i have added using the <script> tag in my html body i added <script> $(function () { getLoadForm('foo); });  </script> I got Uncaught ReferenceError: getLoadForm is not defined
[10:45:59] <IHasFingers> just wondering how to call this method
[13:55:07] <robertmaxrees> IHasFingers you referred to it as a method but it looks like it's just a function - is that a complete code example?
[14:18:41] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, hi its sorted now
[14:19:13] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix? :)
[14:19:39] <IHasFingers> needed to make the method global
[14:20:07] <robertmaxrees> the example you gave should've worked fine if you defined the method properly.  weird.
