[00:05:12] <ctin> why progressbar does not going to finish?
[00:15:01] <chrislabeard> I’m having some issues with skrollr and a retina display being very very jittery. Has anyone had this issue or found a solution?
[00:52:08] <Rubynaut> hello! i am searching for a method to drag/drop div elements to certain positions. i know the plugin gridster for example. but it would be nice to move the layers and give them certain css attributes for bootstrap for example. any ideas?
[00:52:53] <Cork> Rubynaut: you could have a look at sortable/draggable
[00:53:04] <Rubynaut> Cork: jquery ui?
[00:53:07] <Cork> though you would have to extend them to get what you want
[00:53:08] <Cork> yes
[00:53:39] <Rubynaut> hmhm
[01:02:32] <Mayank_> Hi, I am injecting jQuery code within an iframe - the code is injected fine. But the selectors are still respect to the body element and not the iframe. That is I need to $('#iframe).contents().find(selector), even when the jQuery code is running from inside the iFrame. Can I make it run without the $('#iframe').contents().find('selector') method?
[01:04:52] <Cork> Mayank_: not sure what you mean
[01:04:59] <xec> Mayank_: that doesn't sound right
[01:05:05] <Cork> Mayank_: are you running the code from outside the iframe or?
[01:05:39] <Cork> as you talk about injecting i suspect your functions come from the outer page
[01:06:00] <xec> what Cork said. if you need to do $('#iframe).contents(). etc it sounds like the code is not running in the iframe
[01:06:10] <Mayank_> Cork: I am running the code from within the iframe. But for finding the element within the iframe I still need to use $('#iframe').contents().find('iframeelement')
[01:06:20] <Cork> Mayank_: code please
[01:06:33] <xec> Mayank_: how exactly are you "injecting" the code?
[01:07:26] <Mayank_> Cork, xec: ('#iframe').contents().find('body').append('<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/somejs.js"></script>');
[01:07:41] <Mayank_> I am using this to inject code within the iframe ^
[01:07:59] <Cork> and inside somejs.js you run $() and it points to the other document?
[01:08:14] <Cork> that makes no sense at all
[01:09:02] <Mayank_> Cork: yes, exactly thats the issue. It points to the DOM (the one containing the iframe).
[01:09:04] <xec>  i'm not 100% sure how .contents() work here
[01:09:20] <Cork> contains just grabs the document of the iframe
[01:09:35] <Cork> Mayank_: and how are you injecting jquery in the other page
[01:09:45] <Cork> are you doing append twice?
[01:09:46] <xec> contains?
[01:09:52] <Cork> opps
[01:09:55] <Cork> *contents
[01:10:00] <xec> right
[01:10:18] <Mayank_> Cork: I am using  - ('#iframe').contents().find('body').append('<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/jquery.min.js"></script>');
[01:10:37] <Cork> Mayank_: ok, again you need to share the code
[01:10:42] <Mayank_> the main page has one more copy of jQuery
[01:10:48] <Cork> and by the code i don't mean the append code
[01:11:10] <Mayank_> Ok, Ill try to strip out the unnecessary things and post the code.
[01:11:18] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[01:11:18] <xec> you could try $('<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/jquery.min.js"></script>').appendTo($("#iframe")[0].contentWindow.body)
[01:11:36] <Cork> xec: that would do the same thing
[01:12:18] <Cork> wait a min...
[01:12:22] <Cork> append script...
[01:12:28] <Cork> i think i know whats going on here
[01:12:28] <Mayank_> yes, will be using jsfiddle.net
[01:12:32] * Cork digs into the code
[01:13:45] <Cork> sigh
[01:13:52] <xec> you're right, i thought .contents() returned a copy or something
[01:13:53] <Cork> oh, jquery what funny you are
[01:13:58] <frojnd> Hi there :)
[01:13:59] <Cork> it's append
[01:14:08] <Cork> you can't append script to a different document
[01:14:11] <frojnd> How is it called when you are "listening" for a button click?
[01:14:12] <xec> it strips scripts?
[01:14:29] <Cork> xec: jQuery.globalEval( ( node.text || node.textContent || node.innerHTML || "" ).replace( rcleanScript, "" ) );
[01:14:42] <Cork> it eval's it
[01:14:48] <xec> aah
[01:14:53] <xec> hehehe
[01:15:00] <xec> of course
[01:15:15] * xec facepalms
[01:15:24] <Cork> i remembered seeing this way back in 1.3
[01:15:33] <Cork> i just forgot it cause i use iframes so rarely
[01:15:41] <Mayank_> Cork, xec: Any other way I could achieve this?
[01:15:55] <Cork> sure
[01:16:28] <xec> $("#iframe")[0].documentWindow.body.innerHTML += "<script etc>";
[01:16:29] <xec> ? :P
[01:16:39] <Cork> var doc = $('#iframe').prop('contentDocument'), script1 = doc.createElement('script'), script2 = doc.createElement('script');
[01:16:48] <Cork> that is how i would do it
[01:17:04] <Cork> and then just doc.head.appendChild(script1); doc.head.appendChild(script2)
[01:17:08] <xec> yeah the appending to innerHTML of body is bad, i'm guessing it would redraw everything
[01:17:34] <Mayank_> Cork: Ahh, this is cool! Will try this out!
[01:17:41] <Mayank_> Thanks guys!
[01:17:58] <xec> all hail the Cork
[01:18:38] <Mayank_> haha!
[01:19:42] <Cork> Mayank_: note though, remember that script injected are async
[01:20:01] <Cork> Mayank_: so you need to use the load event from the jquery script tag to trigger the functions in the second script
[01:21:01] <Mayank_> Great! Thanks for letting me know that!
[01:21:53] <computer2000> anyone good in paper.js?
[01:23:00] <xec> Mayank_: there's a nice example at stackoverflow.com/questions/8578617#answer-8578840
[01:24:05] <Mayank_> xec: the injected script needs to wait.
[01:24:58] <xec> for what
[01:25:16] <xec> jquery, right? that's what that snippet would do

[01:26:40] <frojnd> Hi there. I'd like to convert this document.ready function into something more like functional, so I could call it anythime I'd want: http://jsbin.com/kitibu/1/edit and then I'd define a listener or smth like that and within that listner I'd call this function. Any tips how can I convert this?
[01:26:53] <Mayank_> xec: oh, yeah! Thanks!

[01:28:32] <Cork> it's still wow :)
[01:29:05] <ctin> Cork problem solved)))
[01:29:19] <ctin> bye
[01:30:25] <xec> frojnd: if i understand you correctly, you can just make it a named function? http://jsbin.com/qekilobi/1/edit
[01:33:21] <frojnd> xec: I'd like to ommit $('#myButton").click(function() {...}); and made that function independent of myButton, but rather provide a event listener or something like that so when the user will click on a myButton different functions could get executed
[01:33:39] <frojnd> xec: am I clear enought or am I talking jibberish?
[01:38:06] <frojnd> xec: I'll paste whole example of code
[01:42:24] <frojnd> xec: http://jsbin.com/kitibu/1/edit what I'm trying to do is only use one button "Get" to make a service request and then save data to offline database without "Into DB" button.
[01:42:43] <frojnd> xec: so I think I have to make my code more OOP or smth.
[01:44:16] <frojnd> xec: like you made a function that can be called. The idea is to make a event listener for one button and then call different functions. Am I thinking this in a good programmer way or am I talking shit? :)
[01:44:33] <xec> honestly i'm not sure what you mean
[01:45:44] <xec> of course you can make multiple functions and call them all from the same event handler
[01:46:06] <xec> but i doubt that's what you're really asking?
[01:46:06] <frojnd> xec: if you click "Get" button (can you see it? I've updated code) you make a rest request and then response is shown. If you click "Into DB" button, this data from dom is saved into database.
[01:46:38] <frojnd> xec: the idea now is, to save rest response directly to database and at the same time show content in the browser
[01:47:21] <frojnd> xec: so when I click get, a request to rest service is made. A response isa saved into database and also shown in browser, so I don't have to press "Into DB" just to save data into database
[01:47:56] <xec> sure
[01:48:15] <xec> just do addPerson() or whatever you wanted, inside the event handler for the first button?
[01:52:37] <frojnd> yeah that works. But now I have document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { ... }); that I don't need as evenet listener
[01:53:50] <AxonetBE> I’m using jquery mobile and I disabled the ajax calls when usign links because it breaks our application. Is there a way to just disable this ajax calls but keep the loader when clicking on a link?

[02:08:39] <seutje> mogaj: in that scope, "this" is the DOM element, not a jQuery collection
[02:08:49] <seutje> DOM elements don't have a .val() method, jQuery collections do
[02:09:28] <mogaj> seutje, how can i modify the code to use val()?
[02:09:36] <seutje> so either use $(this).val() or this.value

[02:20:02] <Rubynaut> short question. http://jsfiddle.net/pjEpg/4/ ... .add_block is of course not recognized, cause it is a new dom object. but how can i handle this?
[02:20:42] <Cork> Rubynaut: delegate
[02:20:56] <Cork> Rubynaut: add the listener on a static parent and delegate the event listning there
[02:20:58] <Rubynaut> Cork: not on?
[02:21:10] <Cork> Rubynaut: a form of on
[02:21:15] <Cork> check the api page
[02:21:23] <Cork> or read delegate
[02:21:26] <Cork> ?api delegate
[02:21:27] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:22:07] <Rubynaut> Cork: so i should delegate #workspace, or?
[02:22:36] <Cork> you can delegate to workspace yes
[02:24:49] <Rubynaut> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/pjEpg/5/ did i misunderstood it?
[02:25:13] <Cork> yes
[02:25:47] <Rubynaut> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/pjEpg/6/
[02:25:48] <Rubynaut> :)
[02:26:35] <Cork> Rubynaut: http://jsfiddle.net/pjEpg/7/
[02:27:00] <Cork> Rubynaut: also read the delegate page
[02:27:14] <Cork> instead of just reading the syntax part and guessing
[02:27:35] <Rubynaut> Cork: see http://jsfiddle.net/pjEpg/6/ is working "fine", but there seems to be a loop
[02:28:20] <Cork> hxm: what do you mean by that?
[02:28:35] <Cork> Rubynaut: again read the documentation
[02:28:50] <hxm> i receive a direct from php and the .ajax opens it in a new page leaving the webapp
[02:29:17] <Cork> .ajax opend it??
[02:29:43] <Cork> hxm: opened what?
[02:29:50] <Cork> and what did open it
[02:30:46] <hxm> i open the index.php, right? then ask for user login, i join, then the auth redirects me to somewhere else, and this is where the webapp closes and i go to the main webrowser
[02:31:36] <Cork> hxm: if you want the form post to not cause a full page reloads you need to catch the submit event on the form and make an ajax call of it
[02:31:55] <hxm> ah

[02:35:29] <seutje> are you trying to trigger it? cause otherwise you need to pass a handler

[02:51:27] <chrisjallen> hi, i am trying to call a tracking script and also submit a form using $('form').submit(), but the submit is cancelling the tracking call. how can i wait till the tracking call has finished before submitting?
[02:52:24] <Cork> chrisjallen: you would have to abort the ajax submit event, wait for the other call to end, and fire the event again
[02:53:03] <Cork> heh one question/answer a screen... nice...
[02:58:29] <abishek> i need an advice regarding an issue that I am having regarding the save method that I am calling on mousemove. I want to throttle the save calls, can someone advice on what is the right way to do it. I tried using underscore.js's _throttle, but it seems to affect the move event if I put it inside throttle
[02:59:25] <Cork> abishek: there are several ways
[02:59:43] <Cork> abishek: you could set a timeout and as long as the time out is active not queue another one
[02:59:57] <Cork> abishek: or you could set a counter and only fire it every x updates
[03:00:25] <abishek> Cork, to which should I set the timeout? The save or the move?
[03:00:38] <Cork> abishek: the move
[03:00:46] <Cork> and trigger the save from the timeout
[03:01:09] <abishek> how do I check if a timeout is active or how do I know if it is active?
[03:01:19] <Cork> something like window.saver = setTimeout(function() { /* save */ window.saver = null; })
[03:01:31] <Cork> check if the variable has been set to null
[03:01:36] <abishek> ok
[03:01:45] <Cork> opps missed the timeout time :x
[03:01:51] <abishek> thats ok
[03:02:10] <Cork> well basically something like this if(!window.saver) { window.saver = setTimeout(function() { /* save */ window.saver = null; }, 200) }
[03:04:04] <Alina-malina> hey i put this into password confirmation input field, but it doesnt work data-validation="confirmation"   why?
[03:04:48] <abishek> Cork, something like this http://jsbin.com/wofut/1/edit
[03:05:28] <seutje> Alina-malina: without any script hooking into it, data attributes don't do anything
[03:05:39] <Cork> abishek: not exactly what i had in mind, but it should work
[03:05:40] <Alina-malina> seutje, hmmm
[03:05:43] <seutje> (they can trigger CSS styling as well, I know)
[03:06:08] <abishek> Cork, can this be improved?
[03:06:10] <Cork> abishek: i would prob move the if case into the save though
[03:06:22] <abishek> ok
[03:07:16] <Cork> abishek: apart from that it is about as good as it gets for a simple throttler
[03:07:32] <abishek> ok, thnx
[03:07:56] <abishek> is 5000 and ideal timeout?
[03:08:15] <Cork> abishek: depends on how often you want it to trigger
[03:08:24] <abishek> k
[03:08:25] <Cork> i don't know the use case of this code
[03:08:43] <Cork> abishek: also you might want to consider using websocket
[03:08:56] <Cork> it would reduce the cost of those updates
[03:08:58] <abishek> Cork, websocket for?
[03:09:10] <Cork> abishek: the "save" updates
[03:09:18] <abishek> ok
[03:09:28] <Cork> abishek: you could create a websocket and push the data over the open channel
[03:09:42] <Cork> instead of opening and closing a channel for each update
[03:09:49] <abishek> Cork, ok
[03:09:53] <Cork> the cost becomes quite high if your using https
[03:11:01] <abishek> Cork, its mostly happening locally and not ajax, that was mostly an example. I am saving the data to localstorage
[03:11:41] <Cork> abishek: hmm, localstorage is sync so you might want to rethink that
[03:11:57] <Cork> but well ya, your making it async with the timer so...
[03:12:05] <abishek> ok
[03:12:28] <Cork> but you can get lag from localstorage if your storing a lot of data

[03:25:27] <Cork> CrowX-: you would have to get the height of the page and subtract
[03:25:39] <Cork> or height of the viewport

[03:43:44] <DeafGoose> console.log(val.id); can't get the id using this
[03:45:00] <Cork> DeafGoose: you can't load js from the normal github.com page
[03:45:06] <CrowX-> Cork, but top: auto puts the element(which is absolute) under a relative element, and if I set margin-top, it moves it at the top of the page and then sets the margin
[03:45:09] <Cork> it has the wrong mimetype
[03:45:29] <CrowX-> I need it few pixels upper from where it is
[03:45:34] <DeafGoose> let me change that
[03:45:39] <Cork> CrowX-: what?
[03:45:42] <DeafGoose> still, local results are same :)
[03:46:05] <Cork> CrowX-: CrowX- you change the margin-top of the element in the direction you want to move the element
[03:46:11] <CrowX-> Cork, the element I want to move up for 3 pixels is an absolute element which appears under a relative element. If I set margin-top, it ignores the relative element and puts it at the top
[03:46:43] <Cork> CrowX-: are you trying to get an absolute element take pageflow into account?
[03:46:49] <Cork> cause they don't
[03:47:13] <CrowX-> it appears under the relative element by default though
[03:47:31] <Cork> most likely cause the relative element is later in the page
[03:47:46] <Cork> set the z-index if you want to change the order
[03:47:53] <CrowX-> err
[03:48:01] <arschmitz> Cork: CrowX-: absolute positioned elements will take page flow into account in some cases if you dont set position in anyway
[03:48:03] <CrowX-> by under/over I meant, upper and lower
[03:48:32] <Cork> arschmitz: not really, it just offsets to the current position of where it would be if it wasn't absolute positioned
[03:48:36] <CrowX-> arschmitz, I want to use the page flow it took by default, and apply the position according to it
[03:48:46] <Cork> it doens't take other elements into account when layout is placing it
[03:48:59] <Cork> CrowX-: and i told you how
[03:49:02] <Cork> use margin-top
[03:49:20] <arschmitz> cork: right which has the effect of making it basicly take page flow into account
[03:49:29] <arschmitz> but CrowX- what your trying to do wont work
[03:49:30] <CrowX-> Cork, margin-top makes it ignore the position it took before I defined any position
[03:49:43] <CrowX->  <Cork> arschmitz: not really, it just offsets to the current position of where it would be if it wasn't absolute positioned <- I want to move it relative to that position.
[03:50:04] <arschmitz> because as soon as you adjust position in anyway those auto's basicly turn to zero
[03:50:26] <DeafGoose> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/J5s29/3/
[03:50:40] <arschmitz> CrowX-: you cant really do what your trying to do position absolute as Cork is trying to tell you just does not work that way
[03:50:56] <CrowX-> ok
[03:51:37] <Cork> CrowX-: http://jsfiddle.net/LbMt2/
[03:51:39] <Cork> works fine here
[03:53:26] <CrowX-> weird
[03:53:31] <CrowX-> it works for me now too
[03:53:32] <Cork> DeafGoose: http://jsfiddle.net/J5s29/4/
[03:53:41] <CrowX-> must've been the confidence your example gave me Cork :)
[03:54:14] <DeafGoose> you are awesome Cork :)
[03:54:47] <DeafGoose> however i need to dig a bit deeper, theres a attribute called data-isocode_3 thats what im really after
[03:55:40] <DeafGoose> it is under "attributes" on the object
[03:56:11] <SprkDev> Why isn't the button doing anything? I have loaded all of the scripts via enque and register in another file and is visible thru firebug. http://pastebin.com/ZdEuSLS9
[03:57:03] <Cork> DeafGoose: http://jsfiddle.net/J5s29/6/
[03:57:43] <DeafGoose> Cork, I thank you very much!!!
[04:02:21] <murosai> what's the point of same-origin-policy if you can get around with JSONP anyway?
[04:02:47] <Cork> murosai: cause the site would have to implement support for jsonp for you to access it
[04:02:54] <Cork> murosai: and it still blocks posts
[04:03:03] <Cork> (you can only do get calls with jsonp)
[04:07:29] <frojnd> Any idaes why it wont fade on mosue click? http://jsfiddle.net/howdre/4STCH/
[04:08:03] <Cork> frojnd: check your browser console
[04:08:06] <xqo> hi
[04:08:38] <xqo> Im trying to use websockets: http://jsfiddle.net/UsXk5/2/ But I keep getting this error: Error in event handler for extension.onRequest: undefined. Whats the matter???
[04:09:03] <Cork> frojnd: also why don't you just do that in css?
[04:09:17] <serdem420> hey guys, i would like to post form via ajax. do i have to pass all input's values to data seperately?
[04:09:45] <serdem420> i have searched on google there are are some suggestion to use serialize() function but it gives an error
[04:10:05] <Cork> xqo: sounds like your looking on server side errors
[04:10:12] <Cork> xqo: that code is valid
[04:10:28] <Cork> ?api serialize
[04:10:28] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:10:32] <Cork> serdem420: ^
[04:10:43] <xqo> Cork ok thank you.
[04:12:05] <serdem420> Cork,  this gives and error $.ajax({
[04:12:05] <serdem420>  type: "POST",
[04:12:05] <serdem420> url: "deneme.php",
[04:12:05] <serdem420> : $("#form517").serialize() : function(msg) { ("Form Submitted: " + msg); });
[04:12:14] <serdem420> opss sorry
[04:12:18] <Cork> don't post code in the channel
[04:12:48] <serdem420> http://pastebin.com/gi9R1yMb
[04:13:01] <serdem420> i know i am sorry :)
[04:13:08] <Cork> serdem420: the semicolon should be a comma
[04:13:20] <Cork> else you will have parsing error
[04:13:49] <jax> i got a form with a lot of inputs with the same name (array). is there a way to only send the inputs that actually have a value?
[04:13:53] <jax> most are empty and are just filling up POST
[04:14:13] <Cork> jax: normal post you mean?
[04:14:17] <Cork> or through ajax?
[04:14:31] <jax> normal
[04:14:39] <Cork> not really
[04:15:04] <Cork> you could remove the name attribute on them before the post to prevent them from submitting
[04:15:15] <jax> good idea
[04:15:23] <jax> thanks Cork
[04:17:46] <serdem420> Cork, wow i am a moron :( thanks but now it gives "XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://s1065054172.ttt.com. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access." error
[04:18:07] <Cork> serdem420: crossdomain calls is blocked by browsers
[04:18:24] <Cork> the server has to allow it
[04:18:41] <serdem420> Cork, uh so i can not send form via ajax to different domain?
[04:18:46] <Cork> no
[04:19:01] <Cork> not unless that server explicitly allow it
[04:19:15] <Cork> (through the cors header)
[04:19:57] <CrowX-> in my page http://whatishacking.org/rachel in the 'press' page in the menu, I have a list of links which for some reason aren't clickable anywhere except at a tiny point in their center
[04:20:01] <CrowX-> what could be the reason?
[04:20:54] <Cork> CrowX-: what menu?
[04:20:56] <Cork> where
[04:21:22] <CrowX-> Cork, once you open the page, click the 'enter' button that follows the mouse, then in the menu in the top choose 'press'
[04:22:32] <Cork> CrowX-: cause #buttons covers them
[04:22:40] <Cork> point and right click
[04:22:41] <CrowX-> oh
[04:22:56] <Cork> and select inspect
[04:23:03] <Cork> and you'll see what element your actually hovering
[04:23:05] <CrowX-> yeah, thanks
[04:23:12] <CrowX-> any idea how I could make them override #buttons, but not cover it?
[04:23:26] <CrowX-> oh nvm
[04:23:29] <Cork> CrowX-: your moving it there with js
[04:23:30] <CrowX-> i'll just hide() button
[04:24:09] <frojnd> Cork: I've removed ')' but still it won't hide the div: http://jsfiddle.net/howdre/4STCH/ I'm doing it in jquery because I'm learning jquery :)
[04:24:28] <Cork> frojnd: you still have parser errors
[04:24:59] <Cork> actually you have quite serious syntax errors all over the place
[04:25:00] <frojnd> hm
[04:25:04] <frojnd> wait mayb I must save
[04:25:10] <Cork> you pass function() {}
[04:25:17] <Cork> not function)() {}
[04:25:35] <Cork> or function()) {}
[04:27:56] <frojnd> alright
[04:28:05] <frojnd> goona be more  careful with parenthesis
[04:28:37] <Uhkis> it also helps to actually load jquery from the left hand menu ;)
[04:33:01] <frojnd> I've selected 2.1.0 jquery
[04:33:03] <frojnd> but it won't work
[04:33:47] <frojnd> ok
[04:33:48] <frojnd> it works
[04:33:58] <frojnd> I wasn't careful enough with fading :D
[04:34:04] <frojnd> it was too fast
[04:34:04] <frojnd> haha
[04:38:00] <ddssc> is there a callback for end of event in jq? for example I would like to do .click(do stuff).callback(runs after click is complete) ?
[04:40:05] <m1chael> i've got a very strange problem. i'm using javascript to get a CSRF cookie and i set a request header $.ajaxsetup({beforesend.... on desktop: my page works perfect.. however, on mobile.. i get a 403 forbidden error because the CSRF cookie is not being sent with the $.post(... this is only happening on mobile (chrome on android) and i don't know how else i can troubleshoot this
[04:40:33] <seutje> ddssc: an event is a single instance in time, there is no beginning or end
[04:40:52] <seutje> some event provide sister-events for this though, but usually custom
[04:47:43] <Cork> m1chael: are you sure it is that it isn't getting set, and not that the cookie is missing?
[04:48:19] <Cork> m1chael: also have you verified that the $.ajaxSetup function is actually called?
[04:51:21] <m1chael> Cork, i've tried a few ways... it seems like xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", csrftoken);  is just not being set
[04:51:43] <m1chael> i'm even trying to set Beforesend directly in my .ajax call
[04:51:52] <m1chael> works on desktop, not on mobile
[04:56:44] <seutje> Lindrian: why is your name so damn familiar? were you an IRCop on quakenet or something?
[04:57:17] <seutje> no wait, deltaanime, I think
[04:57:20] <Lindrian> seutje: ive been around
[04:58:00] <seutje> oh wait, I remember, omegascript!
[04:59:03] <seutje> and if u were on deltaanime, that means you probably played L2
[04:59:58] <seutje> fucking... L2-vendetta... now I remember :')
[05:00:26] <sekyms> How would I bind 'this' to a setTimeout?
[05:01:07] <sekyms> trying this.updateTimeout = setTimeout( function() {}, 3000.bind(this))
[05:01:21] <seutje> var foo = function() {console.log(this);} foo.bind(someContext); setTimeout(foo, 3000); ?
[05:01:27] <seutje> oops
[05:01:38] <seutje> var foo = function() {console.log(this);} foo = foo.bind(someContext); setTimeout(foo, 3000); ?
[05:01:51] <sekyms> I will try that
[05:01:57] <seutje> me too :D
[05:01:59] <sekyms> lol
[05:02:05] <sekyms> RACE
[05:02:24] <sekyms> ugh no fair cat walked across me
[05:02:51] <seutje> haha
[05:02:56] <seutje> I missed a semicolon btw :(
[05:03:03] <seutje> and you could shorten those 2 first calls
[05:03:11] <sekyms> you sure this will work
[05:03:19] <anli> I want to unbind a change handler that goes to an anonymous function
[05:03:20] <sekyms> the more I stare at my cats ass the less sense it makes
[05:03:27] <seutje> so like var foo = (function() {console.log(this);}).bind('lol'); setTimeout(foo, 3000);
[05:03:34] <anli> Is there a way to unbind all anonymous event handlers for an input?
[05:03:49] <seutje> off('change')?
[05:03:59] <seutje> change might be a bit of an exception, not sure
[05:04:12] <anli> Maybe I should just invent an event like "change2"
[05:04:13] <sekyms> ct was standing in front of me
[05:04:21] <sekyms> i wasnt just staring at it's ass btw
[05:04:34] <seutje> anli: for debugging, u can loop over jQuery._data(el, 'events')
[05:04:40] <seutje> where el is a ref to a DOM element
[05:04:43] <anli> Ah, ok
[05:04:48] <anli> cool
[05:04:59] <seutje> but avoid fucking with that in production code
[05:05:05] <anli> Why? :)
[05:05:17] <Lindrian> seutje: yep..
[05:05:17] <Lindrian> spot on
[05:05:19] <anli> Well, I will not use it
[05:05:20] <seutje> _ denotes private methods not meant to be used externally
[05:05:26] <anli> I will add a handler instead
[05:05:28] <seutje> Lindrian: small world :D
[05:05:35] <seutje> anli: u can namespace events
[05:05:39] <seutje> 'change.mine'
[05:05:45] <seutje> (don't use "mine")
[05:06:26] <seutje> Lindrian: I used to dwell the interwebs as "frigginCarebear" and "sci-fi" back then, must have changed a dozen times since
[05:06:40] <Lindrian> i see
[05:06:45] <Lindrian> doesnt ring a bell though :(
[05:07:39] <sekyms> seutje: any ideas for making it work more inline with my code
[05:07:41] <sekyms> https://gist.github.com/smykes/908e2f83a420e2ef8622
[05:07:41] <seutje> didn't rly expect it to, more of an ESL2/L2X kinda guy :P
[05:08:27] <seutje> sekyms: put the bind on the function ur passing to settimeout, not on the return of settimeout (it just returns an ID)
[05:09:01] <sekyms> so https://gist.github.com/smykes/4329eef74e2f5ca5f9e1
[05:09:05] <sekyms> that makes more sense
[05:09:23] <seutje> lol
[05:09:29] <seutje> u put it *inside* the function
[05:09:41] <sekyms> i did
[05:09:44] <seutje> this would be much easier to illustrate if you would name the function :P
[05:10:22] <seutje> say var foo = function() {}; setTimeout(foo, someTimer);
[05:10:41] <seutje> so then u just want setTimeout(foo.bind(bla), simeTimer)
[05:10:57] <seutje> calling bind on it makes it return a function with "locked" context
[05:11:50] <sekyms> seutje: would this be easier if I just named the function?
[05:11:52] * sekyms ducks
[05:12:04] <seutje> :P
[05:13:02] <sekyms> https://gist.github.com/smykes/1fc0ed406498c3e2c0c9
[05:13:57] <sekyms> gah still an error
[05:14:01] <sekyms> thought i had it that time
[05:14:21] <sekyms> oh i left the bind this on the other function
[05:14:23] <sekyms> oops
[05:14:38] <seutje> wait what?
[05:14:57] <seutje> u added another function wrapper and there's another bind in there o.O
[05:15:38] <sekyms> yeha i messed up hold on lol
[05:15:51] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/cf3FnRq0
[05:17:23] <sekyms> think you are missing a curly brace
[05:18:18] <Cork> ugg freenode is really going belly up today
[05:18:56] <sekyms> ok tried your way this context still isn't coming through seutje
[05:19:02] <sekyms> mysterious
[05:19:23] <seutje> weird
[05:21:04] <sekyms> indeed
[05:21:54] <sekyms> seutje: you see anything my eyes don't? https://gist.github.com/smykes/4c5e0b99b620ff3ca737
[05:22:21] <seutje> oh wow, I'm stupid
[05:22:28] <seutje> remove the () after detData
[05:22:30] <seutje> getData
[05:22:31] <sekyms> what does that make me?
[05:22:46] <seutje> seksy?
[05:22:53] <seutje> sry, I keep reading ur name like that in my head
[05:22:55] <sekyms> how do i pas parameters then?
[05:23:00] <Cork> after get data?
[05:23:06] <Cork> you mean getSome right?
[05:23:12] <seutje> errr yeah
[05:23:22] <seutje> in the setTimeout
[05:23:24] <Cork> getSome().bind(this) => getSome.bind(this)
[05:23:27] <sekyms> getSome seksy?
[05:23:31] <seutje> yeah
[05:23:35] <seutje> what Cork said
[05:23:47] <seutje> u wanna call bind on the function, not on its return value
[05:23:58] <seutje> (which is null anyway
[05:24:07] <sekyms> what if i had to pass parameters?
[05:24:11] <sekyms> i would pass it in bind?
[05:24:16] <Cork> you would have to set them in bind
[05:24:22] <Cork> that is what bind is for
[05:24:23] <sekyms> ok that make sense
[05:24:41] <sekyms> holy shit it worked!
[05:24:58] <seutje> u can also just pass extra parameters to setTimeout, but oldIE doesn't support it
[05:25:00] <seutje> iirc
[05:25:14] <Cork> seutje: well old ie doesn't support bind either :)
[05:25:24] <sekyms> old meaning pre-8?
[05:25:24] <seutje> I was actually thinking that just now lol
[05:25:27] <sekyms> or pre 7?
[05:25:28] <Cork> pre ie9
[05:25:36] <sekyms> awe ffs
[05:25:38] <sekyms> really?
[05:25:45] <Cork> ya
[05:25:50] <sekyms> i can add a shim though iirc
[05:25:53] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Browser_compatibility
[05:25:58] <seutje> so I guess u'll have to do some scope juggling
[05:26:00] <sekyms> a protprype
[05:26:05] <seutje> ye olde that = this
[05:26:15] <Cork> there is a shim in that page
[05:26:26] <Cork> sekyms: or you could just use $.proxy() instead :)
[05:26:29] <seutje> $.proxy() also works on oldIE
[05:26:31] <seutje> damnit
[05:26:36] <Cork> :P
[05:26:46] * seutje shakes fist in angry manner and storms out for a smoke
[05:26:59] <sekyms> Cork https://gist.github.com/smykes/d74d19fe37c899c72577
[05:27:08] <sekyms> seutje thanks for the help
[05:28:03] <sekyms> seutje: I use that in an IE app and it works
[05:43:17] <sekyms> thanks Cork and seutje
[05:44:27] <decx> i still can't believe ie6 is actually dead
[05:44:42] <Jattenalle> IE7 is dying as well
[05:45:10] <Jattenalle> hell, it's a good bet IE<9 will die fairly quick now that XP support has been dropped
[05:45:17] <Jattenalle> about time <3
[05:45:47] <decx> all these hours spent fixing up ie6 crap
[05:45:55] <decx> thanks for the money ie6
[05:46:37] <Cork> Jattenalle: except a few annoying tv hosts sits and say it is fine to keep using winxp
[05:46:47] <MikeD_> ie6 did force us to learn a lot about browsers' rendering differences
[05:46:58] <Jattenalle> Corey, -_-
[05:47:03] <Jattenalle> err, sorry Corey, tab complete
[05:47:07] <Jattenalle> Cork ^^ -_-
[05:47:38] <Jattenalle> MikeD_, that's not a good thing though, since IE6 didnt do "different" it did "broken" :P
[05:48:35] <MikeD_> right, but I think if you're going to speak of the dead you should try to find something positive - even if the deceased was a SOB :)
[05:49:04] <seutje> don't forget about gov and NGOs
[05:49:09] <decx> it always reminded us that albeit something is popular, doesn't mean it's good. thanks ie6 feeding the eternal hipster
[05:49:26] <seutje> we have Bieber for that tbh
[05:51:03] <Jattenalle> seutje, ugh.. still have nightmares about having to maintain ancient shit for companies
[05:51:33] <MikeD_> heh, the damage done will haunt your code style for years
[05:52:07] <Jattenalle> nah, i came out unharmed, i code in BASIC now
[05:52:13] * Jattenalle twitches slightly
[05:52:33] <MikeD_> BASIC was the language they programmed the banana-throwing monkey game, right?
[05:52:41] <Jattenalle> haha, yes
[05:52:49] <Jattenalle> it came with QuickBASIC 4.5 as an example
[05:53:01] <Jattenalle> or maybe it was PDS 7.1,, either way.. good times
[05:53:22] <MikeD_> "Quick" + "Basic" = how could that ever go badly?
[05:53:40] <Jattenalle> hey now, FreeBASIC is pretty damned fast :), and i do actually use it ;)
[05:53:56] <MikeD_> Free is even better than Quick
[05:54:18] <Jattenalle> and quickbasic was amazing for its time, being able to hit a single key to instantly run your code, and get instant feedback on broken code/syntax right in the IDE
[05:54:23] <Jattenalle> no other language had that
[05:54:37] <Jattenalle> they were all: use editor, compile with commandline, hope it didnt break..
[05:54:56] <Jattenalle> ("no other language had that" take with grain of salt, i havent actually researched)
[05:55:04] <Cork> Jattenalle: no, quickbasic was never amazing...
[05:55:22] <Cork> it was a usable compiler
[05:55:27] <Cork> but far from amazing
[05:55:31] <Jattenalle> Cork, you're just jealous because COBOL never took off ;)
[05:55:51] <Cork> the turbo serie was amazing
[05:55:57] <decx> hate all you want but being able to program on my c64 was the shit
[05:56:05] <MikeD_> you're old.
[05:56:12] <Jattenalle> shots fired!
[05:56:15] <Cork> its editors is beating most of the ides today
[05:56:54] <decx> old yes, that old no. but poor back then so i always got the scraps
[05:57:10] <Cork> Jattenalle: think of a tracer where you can step backwards and it undoes things; you can change the code and step forward again
[05:57:24] <Jattenalle> Cork, yeah quickbasic could do that
[05:57:40] <Cork> hmm, might have forgotten that
[05:57:57] <Jattenalle> it's not something you'd know unless you used it i guess, it really was a brief little time
[05:58:03] <Jattenalle> then windows came along, and Visual*
[05:58:04] <MikeD_> j/k i'm old too... i didn't have a c64, I had TI/994a (saved to cassette!) then an apple//c
[05:58:08] <Cork> Jattenalle: i used it quite a bit
[05:58:24] <decx> it's called datasette
[05:58:26] <decx> :>
[05:58:31] <Cork> basic hasn't ever been my favorite language, but i have a few discetts withit somewhere
[05:58:33] <Jattenalle> Cork, oh, it was the "Step through execution" or something like that, in one of the menus
[05:58:49] <Jattenalle> you could step forward, backwards, and change code at a whim
[05:58:51] <Cork> Jattenalle: step through follows functions
[05:59:06] <Jattenalle> if you changed an earlier variable it'd cascade down to the current step position
[05:59:11] <Jattenalle> was pretty neat for debugging
[05:59:14] <Jattenalle> slow as hell though :P
[05:59:20] <Cork> i've completely forgotten the debugger for quickbasic honestly
[05:59:40] <Cork> hmm
[05:59:45] <Jattenalle> well you didnt really need it, since it'd show you syntax issues immediately
[05:59:56] <Cork> ya
[06:00:12] <Cork> i loved turbo pascal for that reason
[06:00:19] <Cork> turbo c was nice too
[06:00:37] <Cork> cried blood when borland killed the series
[06:00:45] <MikeD_> if you like that sort of thing, I guess you liked the VB IDE
[06:00:58] <Cork> MikeD_: no
[06:01:04] <Jattenalle> VB was horrid
[06:01:07] <Cork> ya
[06:01:10] <Jattenalle> still is
[06:01:22] <Cork> haven't touched it in... ages thankfully
[06:01:44] <Cork> used it for a school project at a company once
[06:01:51] <Cork> that's about it (6 months...)
[06:06:20] <seutje> turbo pascal was fun
[06:06:56] <Cork> ya, it was most likely the most fun editor/language i've used through the years
[06:07:08] <Cork> with a possible exception of a asm editor
[06:07:15] <Cork> (don't remember it's name)
[06:07:31] <Jattenalle> been too long since i used an IDE, nowadays it's notepad++ all the way
[06:08:02] <Cork> i've went away from ides completely
[06:08:20] <Cork> then went to vim
[06:08:26] <Cork> and later over to sublime
[06:08:45] <Cork> sublime is a quite nice balance if you have a graphical interface
[06:09:02] <Cork> (vim is still my goto for console edit)
[06:10:03] <MikeD_> so where do you draw the line between notepad++ and an IDE ?
[06:10:08] <Jattenalle> i never got into sublime, i dont mind it, it's just.. i dunno just happy with notepad++
[06:10:18] <Jattenalle> MikeD_, oh it's blurry for sure
[06:10:47] <Cork> Jattenalle: notepad++ is very close to sublime
[06:11:00] <Jattenalle> yeah i know, i have sublime, sublime 2 even, just never really use it
[06:11:15] <Jattenalle> i really like the visual thing they have where you "see" the code :P
[06:11:30] <MikeD_> yeah, with the language lexer (syntax coloring, folding), autocomplete, nppFTP, various "run in" hotkeys, i feel like N++ is more-featured than some 'real IDE'
[06:11:42] <Cork> MikeD_: in my world when you have things like dialog editors, built in debuggers and things like that you have an ide
[06:12:03] <MikeD_> oh yeah, "Interactive Development Environment" = IDE
[06:12:16] <Cork> notepad and sublime is basically just a texteditor + a limited project manager
[06:12:18] <Uhkis> it's not integrated anymore?
[06:12:22] <Cork> with some code lookup helpers
[06:12:37] <decx> has anyone tested that new live edit without save in sublime
[06:12:55] <Cork> decx: live edit?
[06:13:02] <decx> it's an extension
[06:13:08] <decx> saw it on hackernews a few weeks back
[06:13:19] <Cork> so it basically saves after each keypress?
[06:13:23] <decx> everyone knows live edit, but this one worked without saving
[06:13:28] <Cork> or how would they solve that?
[06:13:37] <decx> no clue
[06:13:41] <Cork> what you edit is in ram so...
[06:14:09] <decx> the commenters seemed amazed but i didnt test it yet
[06:14:10] <Cork> setInterval(save, 100);
[06:14:11] <Cork> :)
[06:14:30] <decx> oh right
[06:14:35] <decx> with scss live editing
[06:14:37] <decx> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7511338
[06:14:37] <Jattenalle> yeah, i dont see that being all that.. amazing?
[06:14:51] <Jattenalle> "no save" = "save all the time"
[06:14:53] <Jattenalle> basically
[06:15:13] <SprkDev> How do I get $_FILES from this http://www.croppic.net/ ?
[06:15:13] <Cork> ya
[06:15:15] <Jattenalle> wonder how that'd destroy a repo, all the files are in use all teh time, by all the people!
[06:15:20] <Cork> Jattenalle: and not just save
[06:15:29] <Jattenalle> 500 million on-change commits :P
[06:15:32] <Cork> it runs the text through nodejs to generate a css file
[06:15:39] <decx> it's not even reloading though
[06:15:47] <decx> in the preview
[06:15:56] <Cork> decx: well kinda
[06:15:58] <Cork> through js
[06:17:28] <decx> well it looks interesting and i'll try it out in the my fresh unimportant project
[06:17:44] <decx> next*
[06:18:01] <decx> good lord, i've been writing emails all day and now i reached the point where words go missing
[06:18:20] <Jattenalle> we've all been there decx
[06:18:41] <decx> time for a walking break :D
[06:19:33] <frojnd> Hm
[06:20:02] <SprkDev> I have used this jquery plugin which is working. But can't figure out way to get the cropped file with $_FILES. help pls http://www.croppic.net/ ?
[06:20:11] <frojnd> Where can I find documentaion for ajax .done function? So far I managed to find out this is called imeediately after ajax requst/response https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[06:35:06] <berpcor> Hello,
[06:35:41] <fattest>  Can someone please help me, ive been stuck on it for ages. I saw this table http://jsfiddle.net/js64b/534/ sorting fiddle and decided to test it on a bigger table, with more data. However, the table is not sorting! please help! this is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/js64b/538/
[06:36:10] <mctim> two google maps questions:  (1) I have a set of points drawn within a polygon.  the polygon has an onclick event listener and so do each of the points.  ONly the tooltip for the polygon is showing now.  Will the polygon interfere with the event handling of the point?  How do I inspect the eventListeners registered on the map in google chrome?
[06:36:51] <Fraz> hi
[06:37:14] <fattest> Fraz: hello
[06:37:16] <Fraz> has anyone here used the the youtube player api along with jquery?
[06:37:19] <berpcor> I have some checkboxes with the same name. I use $(form).serialize(). When I alert all checkboxes it shows me permission=1&permission=2&permission=3, but when I get this data in php via POST I get only the last value. Is it possible somehow to group checkboxes values by its name(permissions=1,2,3)?
[06:37:41] <berpcor> In jquery.
[06:38:43] <Fraz> firebug keeps giving me the error YT.player is not a constructor. Yet the video is embedded and working fine
[06:39:20] <Cork> Fraz: might be that your running the code twice?
[06:39:43] <Cork> once before the lib is loaded and once after
[06:39:53] <Cork> qgit st
[06:39:55] <Cork> opps
[06:41:01] <Fraz> Cork heres the script http://pastebin.com/9Pz5VjD5
[06:41:47] <Cork> Fraz: can't do much with a dead code dump
[06:42:19] <Fraz> dead code dump?
[06:42:40] <CrowX-> I have a button with a click event to do a function. But in another function I would like the button's click event to do something else, so I did $(buttonSelector).unbind("click") and then redefined the click event for the button. However, the click event is still only valid for the function that runs first.
[06:42:45] <Cork> Fraz: to be able to check what is the problem one needs to see the code in action
[06:42:48] <CrowX-> how could I fix this?
[06:42:50] <Cork> text in a pb won't help
[06:43:12] <Fraz> oh, just wondered if you could see why it would run twice from that code if that was the case
[06:43:18] <CrowX-> how do you redefine a click event?
[06:43:40] <Fraz> http://www.rogersarchitects.com/ << Cork, the code is used on this page
[06:43:55] <Fraz> the last slider is a youtube video
[06:44:04] <Fraz> slide*
[06:44:37] <CrowX-> nvm, it worked
[06:44:45] <Cork> CrowX-: bind a click handler and check a value on the element
[06:44:52] <Cork> CrowX-: and have the one handler do all the work
[06:45:06] <Cork> CrowX-: it results in much cleaner code if you structure it like that
[06:45:14] <Cork> .data() is grate for that
[06:45:27] <CrowX-> gmm, that's better
[06:47:33] <Abbbbbbhi> Try WebStrom its true IDE
[06:47:49] <Cork> Fraz: could you add a console.log(YT.Player) on line 25?
[06:47:59] <SprkDev> #php
[06:48:09] <Cork> Fraz: it looks like your getting some form of race condition
[06:48:23] <Cork> cause putting a breakpoint there prevents it
[06:49:46] <Fraz> line 25 is in the middle of the yt player creaton code (parameters)
[06:49:56] <Cork> hmm no here
[06:49:58] <Fraz> modestbranding : 1,
[06:50:01] <Cork> it is directly before it
[06:50:36] <Cork> Fraz: i meant after the var vid = jQuery(this).attr("id").split("_")[1]; line
[06:51:17] <Fraz> ok ive added it there
[06:51:23] <Fraz> logs Y(a, b);
[06:52:01] <Cork> so ya you call it twice
[06:52:39] <Fraz> so why isnt it logging an undefined?
[06:52:52] <Fraz> oh it is
[06:52:53] <Fraz> sorry
[06:52:56] <Fraz> right
[06:53:06] <Fraz> can you see how its being called twice?
[06:53:21] <Cork> no, that is confusing me a bit
[06:53:28] <fattest> Cork: can you please have a look at my js issue?
[06:54:11] <Cork> Fraz: could you add a log line before the each loop too?
[06:54:25] <Cork> (man i hate debugging race cases)
[06:54:31] <Fraz> logging the same?
[06:54:36] <CaptToaster> hi whats the fasest way to send data to a server with jquery? I'm using jquery.ajax and I'm getting some lag. I need to post everytime a user clicks, but if a user clicks a lot the browser freezes up.
[06:54:46] <Cork> Fraz: doesn't matter, i want to know how many time the function is called
[06:54:56] <Cork> actually
[06:55:12] <Cork> do console.log(jQuery(".fullCarouselVideo").length)
[06:55:26] <Cork> then we can beat two birds with one stone
[06:55:45] <Fraz> just logged outside the loop, it logs twice:S
[06:55:46] <Cork> fattest: what was your issue?
[06:55:59] <Cork> lovely
[06:56:35] <Fraz> and the length things logs 1
[06:56:48] <Cork> Fraz: and inside allReady()?
[06:56:53] <Macaveli> Cork, any clue why this doesn't work? https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/49ba8e30390bce590194
[06:57:17] <Cork> Macaveli: define "doesn't work"
[06:57:35] <Macaveli> Uncaught Error: ExecJS::RuntimeError: SyntaxError: unexpected =
[06:57:40] <fattest> Cork: ive been stuck on it for ages. I saw this table http://jsfiddle.net/js64b/534/ sorting fiddle and decided to test it on a bigger table, with more data. However, the table is not sorting! please help! this is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/js64b/538/
[06:57:42] <Fraz> only one log in the allReady function
[06:57:59] <polilla> hello
[06:58:04] <Cork> Macaveli: what line?
[06:58:15] <Macaveli> lang = $("html").attr("lang");
[06:58:25] <Macaveli> He doesn't know $("html")
[06:58:43] <Cork> Macaveli: and the line before that?
[06:58:58] <Cork> Macaveli: also define your variables!
[06:59:01] <Macaveli> doesn't give errors, I want to get the lang tag
[06:59:14] <polilla> I'm using a minified version of jquery 1.10.2 and host it myself. For some reason in Safari only, it tries to load the non-minified version (I didn't include any <script> tags pointing there) –– Does that make any sense? Why would jquery do that?
[06:59:14] <Cork> Macaveli: include the entire function
[06:59:23] <Cork> Macaveli: the error comes from before the lines you've shown
[06:59:55] <Macaveli> Cork if i delete those lines not errors is showing so I think not. It's really the lang = $("html").attr("lang");
[06:59:56] <Cork> fattest: sorry don't know the plugin
[07:00:06] <CrowX-> to make a video full screen, would this work? $(videoSelector)[0].fullscreen()
[07:00:16] <Cork> Macaveli: no you need to show the lines before too, else i can't help you
[07:00:20] <Fraz> ok, looks like flex slider has youtube video support
[07:00:32] <Cork> CrowX-: requestFullScreen()
[07:00:33] <Fraz> so i guess the callback is beingc alled twice, one from that script and once from mine
[07:00:42] <CrowX-> k
[07:00:51] <Cork> Fraz: lovely...
[07:01:06] <Cork> ?mdn requestfullscreen
[07:01:06] <b-ot> Cork: Element.requestFullscreen - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.requestFullScreen
[07:01:10] <Cork> CrowX-: ^
[07:02:04] <Macaveli> Cork, your are not going to like it https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/0d44d10a425f4e303571
[07:02:05] <CrowX-> ?mdn?
[07:02:06] <b-ot> CrowX-: Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/
[07:02:06] <Cork> polilla: if it requests a file without the .min in the file name you have to have it somewhere in your page
[07:02:08] <CrowX-> how do I use that
[07:02:11] <CrowX-> oh
[07:02:12] <CrowX-> ok
[07:02:47] <polilla> Cork: true, I don't have it (just the .min and the .map), but why would it need the non-minified file?
[07:02:53] <polilla> and why would it load it automatically like that?
[07:03:15] <Cork> ugg i hate coffiescript
[07:03:31] <CrowX-> Cork, so I should use mozRequestFullScreen()?
[07:03:46] <CrowX-> what about cross-browser solution?
[07:03:48] <Cork> CrowX-: and webkitFullScreen
[07:03:53] <Cork> sorry
[07:03:57] <CrowX-> those two lines will cover everything?
[07:03:59] <shwaiil> If .nav-border { border-bottom: 20px solid #CCCCCC; }, why $('.nav-border').css("border-bottom") returns "" ?
[07:03:59] <Cork> CrowX-: check the list at the bottom
[07:04:03] <CrowX-> k
[07:04:31] <Macaveli> Cork, now i'm getting unexpected return so I think it's a Coffee thingy
[07:04:35] <Cork> polilla: could you grab a compiled version?
[07:04:44] <Cork> polilla: one that is what the browser gets?
[07:04:56] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[07:05:10] <Cork> Macaveli: those two  lines was for you
[07:05:41] <Cork> polilla: do you have a link?
[07:06:02] <Cork> polilla: cause a resource isn't requested unless you request it in the page
[07:06:12] <polilla> Cork: I'm affraid I don't
[07:06:20] <polilla> it's really weird, it's not happening on any other browser
[07:06:40] <Cork> well safari is a weird browser
[07:06:45] <polilla> I guess I'll just include the non-minified file as well and if it loads on Safari then good for them (I don't use Safari)
[07:06:51] <polilla> Cork: thanks for your help anyway :)
[07:06:53] <anli> I am trying to create a minimal test case of a webpage, which would involve removing the dependency to css files
[07:06:58] <Cork> didn't help much though
[07:07:01] <anli> So I am trying to run this (in the console tab): http://pastebin.com/tWJtEnpx
[07:07:10] <anli> However, that affects the webpage rendition, why?
[07:07:21] <anli> (using firefox)
[07:07:30] <Cork> uh...
[07:07:36] <Cork> var styles = window.getComputedStyle(elem.get(0)); ??
[07:07:43] <Cork> why not just var styles = window.getComputedStyle(this); ?
[07:07:51] <anli> I am iterating the elements in the webpage
[07:07:56] <anli> oooh
[07:07:57] <anli> hehe
[07:08:07] <anli> Well, I am using elem further down, but sure
[07:08:34] <Cork> anli: .get() is a function call
[07:08:38] <ubuNoob> hi guys quick question I am looking for a website template can enable you go left and right. e.g. if you click on about us page instead of the browser reloading to go to that page. it will open the page to right. If you you were opening a book to the next page
[07:08:42] <ubuNoob> if you take a look at http://www.egrappler.com/responsive-app-landing-page/app-landing-page.html#contact
[07:08:47] <ubuNoob> if you click on "feature" product, pricing
[07:08:51] <ubuNoob> the page scroll down and up
[07:08:57] <anli> Cork: Where is .get()?
[07:09:04] <ubuNoob> now imaging it going left or right if you click on contant us
[07:09:05] <Cork> anli: line 5
[07:09:20] <anli> Did I not use it as a function?
[07:09:25] <ubuNoob> i need a template which already done this and where i can buy one of those?
[07:09:25] <Cork> anli: [0] is an array accessor so it is basically free
[07:09:42] <anli> I use this instead
[07:09:43] <Cork> anli: while get(0) is a function call so the browser has to switch context and run the function
[07:09:50] <Cork> anli: just use this as you do have it
[07:09:55] <anli> As I do
[07:10:06] <anli> ...now
[07:10:15] <Cork> anyway that is semantic
[07:10:20] <Cork> what was the real question
[07:10:28] <anli> I am glad you asked
[07:10:32] <anli> The rendition becomes different
[07:10:33] <Cork> ah
[07:10:34] <Cork> rendering
[07:10:42] <Cork> well you update the css
[07:10:43] <anli> The page is fubared
[07:11:06] <Koyuki> Cork: why does jquery validate always add min/max rules? e.g. var $input = $('<input type="text">').get(0); $.validator.attributeRules($input); // Object {min: 0, max: 0}, I don't want min/max rules.
[07:11:08] <polilla> Cork: for the record –– I upgraded to 1.11.0 and it solved the issue
[07:11:10] <anli> It would actually be nice to see all styles that are not default, because I get really fat style tags by running that code
[07:11:44] <Cork> Koyuki: donno
[07:12:03] <Cork> anli: why do you run this code?
[07:12:08] <Cork> seams kinda silly...
[07:12:18] <Pizentios> is there a easy way to search a hash object for a certain value in jquery (much like grep or similar things)
[07:12:32] <Cork> Pizentios: hash?
[07:12:35] <anli> Cork: I already explained, but I understand that it is hard to believe :)
[07:12:36] <Cork> you mean search an object?
[07:12:56] <Pizentios> Cork: yes, sorry i come from the perl world
[07:13:01] <anli> I want to create a html document that is not dependent on other files so I can narrow down a problem
[07:13:22] <Koyuki> Cork: seems like it's b0rked on 1.10+
[07:13:27] <anli> When I have runned this script, I will save the node in firefox
[07:13:30] <Cork> Pizentios: so you want to find the keys that match or what?
[07:13:32] <anli> The html node
[07:14:11] <Cork> anli: i would just add the external css files inside <script> tags instead
[07:14:17] <Cork> sorry
[07:14:20] <Cork> <style> tags
[07:14:24] <anli> hm, yeah
[07:14:25] <Pizentios> i have a array of objects returned from a json query, need to search the results for a value, returning the array position of the object with the match
[07:14:25] <anli> heh
[07:14:34] <Cork> adding it inline on every element would be a nightmare to debug
[07:14:41] <anli> Wonder if there is a script that can do it for me
[07:14:46] <Pizentios> would rather not loop through em
[07:14:50] <anli> yeah, maybe its counter productive
[07:15:06] <anli> I have a td with a larger div inside, I need to find out how that can be
[07:15:10] <Pizentios> was curious if jquery has something to aid in operations like this, haven't found much in my searching
[07:15:33] <Pizentios> possibly because i use the wrong key words as you pointed out before Cork
[07:16:28] <Pizentios> hmmm, filter may work correct?
[07:17:46] <Cork> Pizentios: hmm
[07:17:56] <Cork> Pizentios: i would prob use .indexOf
[07:18:02] <Cork> ?mdn Array.indexOf
[07:18:04] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.indexOf() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[07:18:16] <Pizentios> Cork: thanks i will check that out as well
[07:18:29] <Cork> hmm no wrong function
[07:18:40] <Cork> damn i've forgotten its name >_<
[07:19:24] <Pizentios> heh it happens lol
[07:20:28] <Cork> Pizentios: hmm looks like the function i thought of doesn't exist in cross browsers yet...
[07:20:36] <decx> you'll have to go through the array
[07:20:45] <Cork> Pizentios: if you need the index $.each and grabbing the index there is prob your best option
[07:21:12] <Pizentios> what about something using this: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[07:21:14] <Cork> you could create an abstraction function for it
[07:21:23] <Cork> that is for dom elements only
[07:21:26] <Pizentios> ah
[07:21:33] <Cork> the none dom function is $.grep
[07:21:39] <Cork> ?api grep
[07:21:39] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[07:21:43] <Cork> ?api jQuery.grep
[07:21:44] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[07:21:46] <decx> map?
[07:21:50] <Pizentios> i found a stack overflow page that suggested that filter was the way to go
[07:21:55] <Cork> Pizentios: but it will give you the object, not it's index
[07:22:01] <Pizentios> that's fine
[07:22:07] <Cork> Pizentios: and that is again why you shouldn't trust so
[07:22:13] <Pizentios> :-)
[07:22:15] <Cork> it is full of dissinformation
[07:22:18] <Pizentios> hence why i am here :-)
[07:22:26] <Cork> decx: map builds an array and won't help here
[07:24:19] <decx> oh right, all these ways to go through an array can be confusing
[07:24:57] <Cork> Pizentios: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/V7wKz/
[07:25:38] <Cork> except they have the index first...
[07:25:49] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/V7wKz/1/
[07:26:13] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[07:29:18] <decx> good day
[07:34:09] <ShawnRisk> hi
[07:35:02] <ShawnRisk> I am using this: $(':input[type=number]').keypress(function(){ } yet the site is not doing anything with the code.  What am I doing wrong?
[07:35:50] <decx> type number isnt usable yet
[07:36:00] <Woet> ShawnRisk: please provide a demo on www.jsfiddle.net
[07:36:04] <Woet> oh, nvm then
[07:36:15] <decx> it works in chrome but not ff
[07:36:59] <decx> use a polyfill for the spinwheel
[07:37:55] <decx> made one a while ago, but no keypress support in there yet http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xv5mf/
[07:40:24] <ShawnRisk> decx: well how do I add in only numbers and limit the decimal place to one number within a form input?
[07:41:36] <decx> use a more mature polyfill if you don't want to extend it yourself https://github.com/jonstipe/number-polyfill
[07:42:46] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[07:48:23] <SprkDev> I am already getting json data for img url in response. How do I extract that json data from the browser?
[07:48:28] <SprkDev> I can see it in firebug.
[07:54:02] <Raydiation> how do i do a HEAD request to a different domain?
[07:54:19] <Raydiation> stuck with http://jsfiddle.net/YJyPg/
[07:54:31] <Raydiation> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://bestclipartblog.com/clipart-pics/-test-clipart-9.jpg. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://fiddle.jshell.net' is therefore not allowed access.
[07:55:21] <ShawnRisk> I got my question answered by myself
[07:55:54] <decx> why are you ajaxing an image?
[07:56:00] <decx> also there is no type: head
[07:56:07] <decx> afik
[07:57:20] <Raydiation> decx: i want to get the mime
[07:57:25] <Raydiation> there is a type HEAD
[07:57:26] <Raydiation> ;D
[07:57:32] <Raydiation> its the HTTP method
[07:58:20] <decx> well i'll be
[07:58:22] <decx> there is
[08:10:48] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I have defined an event listener for window resize.  $(window).resize(function() {...});  How do I remove mine without disrupting anything else that might be there?
[08:11:36] <BillCriswell> _cjm: Do like... $(window).on('resize.cjm', function () {});
[08:11:45] <BillCriswell> then .off('resize.cjm')
[08:11:50] <BillCriswell> Think I have that order right.
[08:12:26] <_cjm> BillCriswell, Who raises the "resize.cjm" event?
[08:12:50] <BillCriswell> A resize event
[08:13:02] <BillCriswell> _cjm: http://css-tricks.com/namespaced-events-jquery/ Chris sums it up pretty good here.
[08:13:28] <_cjm> BillCriswell, Thanks for the help.  I ALMOST understand it.
[08:13:42] <BillCriswell> After reading that you should be good!
[08:13:46] <decx> i've read that a few times and always want to use it, but a trailing namespace always seems weird
[08:15:35] <BillCriswell> decx:It does seem a little backwards.
[08:15:46] <BillCriswell> At least from my pretty novice point of view haha
[08:16:20] <decx> if you only work with js objects it's actually pretty straight forward
[08:16:37] <decx> it's not a namespace per se is it
[08:17:40] <BillCriswell> I guess it's more of just a custom event with the illusion of a namespace? I dunno.
[08:19:09] <decx> yeah
[08:19:31] <decx> a namespace would be more like var bill = { click: function(arg) { $.click(arg) } } or something ^^
[08:19:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah.. magic!
[08:20:59] <BillCriswell> I love the accidental effects I get from using transitions in CSS.
[08:22:08] <decx> today i learned that position: fixed can be transitioned to position: absolute and it only looks a *little* bit stupid
[08:22:36] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:22:39] <Genesis_> does anyone know
[08:22:42] <BillCriswell> Haven't had to do that... yet.
[08:22:45] <Genesis_> how/if its a pain
[08:22:51] <Genesis_> to just have a very simple facebook news feed
[08:22:57] <Genesis_> be in a div within a website?
[08:23:04] <Genesis_> (using jquery)
[08:23:15] <decx> you can get public page feeds directly from the api
[08:23:29] <Genesis_> decx: That is exactly what I want
[08:23:39] <Genesis_> do you know of any guides/tutorials on doing that?
[08:23:47] <Genesis_> I don't know much about facebook and am new to jquery
[08:23:49] <decx> i'd google facebook api public page
[08:24:00] <Genesis_> thanks
[08:24:09] <decx> this will probably bring you to the public feed page on the dev site from facebook
[08:25:24] <Genesis_> hmmm
[08:26:36] <decx> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/feed/
[08:26:37] <Pizentios> thanks for your help Cork, i got something working with grep and indexOf
[08:30:28] <Genesis_> decx: I am shocked there isn't any decent articles on stackoverflow about this
[08:30:33] <Genesis_> what i am trying to do is extremely simple
[08:30:47] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I have a reference to a DOM node.  $n = $("div.mine");  and I want to clone it.  $c = $n.clone().  How do I compare these to prove that they are copies and not different references to the SAME node?
[08:31:44] <JamesH__> Hi, Does anyone know when version 1.11 of jquery ui is likely to be out, there is a bug fix due for it that I eagerly await
[08:32:58] <Ualidus> hi
[08:34:34] <Ualidus> I must replace an append in jquery (example : $('#myTable').append($tr) ) by an appendChild in javascript. Problem, my tr has a data set like $tr.data('myObject', JSON) and I must be able to retrieve it later with the node
[08:35:13] <Ualidus> so, if I just replace $('#myTable').append($tr) by $('#myTable')[0].appendChild($tr[0]), will I lost my data ? How to retrieve it in pure javascript ?
[08:36:37] <Ualidus> I tried with dataset in javascript but I can't find my data from before... Plus, javascript "dataset" does not seems to support JSON directly, I must json.stringify it and json.parse it later...
[08:37:54] <NoiseEee> Ualidus: have you tried?
[08:38:36] <NoiseEee> Ualidus: why do you need to replace $('#myTable').append($tr) with $('#myTable')[0].appendChild($tr[0])?  why would you be doing that if you wanted your .data to persist?
[08:40:25] <Ualidus> I benchmarked the append versus appendChild in pure javascript, and the page where I need to do it is reaaaaaaaally heavy, a lot of stuff in it, the append seems too slow for users, they feel the slowness
[08:41:07] <Ualidus> I tried only in console to test if I can retrieve my data, and it seems I can't with technic I mentioned above
[08:41:48] <decx> collect your appends in a document fragment and reduce the need for repaints
[08:42:25] <Ualidus> what do you mean by a document fragment ?
[08:42:27] <CrowX-> when I try to play the video on this site http://whatishacking.org/rachel/ (click the enter button, then go on the menu and choose any of the video options), on linux it works fine on chrome/opera/firefox, but on my windows system it doesn't play on neither internet explorer nor chrome
[08:42:33] <CrowX-> why is this?
[08:45:23] <mariuscc> is it possible to get the screen width of browser window inside an iframe ( not the iframe width ) ?
[08:45:51] <decx> Ualidus http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Eg8px/ instead of 8 repaints for 8 appends, it's collected into a fragment and after the computation is done all is appended at once into the dom
[08:46:35] <BillCriswell> mariuscc: screen.width ?
[08:46:40] <Ualidus> decx: thanks, I look at it right now :)
[08:46:46] <decx> especially when working with tables, cutting down on the repaints will give you a nice performance boost
[08:47:21] <mariuscc> CrowX- , tested on windows 7 chrome and works
[08:47:33] <mariuscc> but I had to click twice the play button
[08:47:42] <mariuscc> maybe that helps you
[08:47:42] <CrowX-> hmm
[08:47:45] <CrowX-> thanks
[08:48:02] <mariuscc> np
[09:09:56] <airdem> hi guys, can you help me with my ui tooltip function? i dont understand why it is not working with data- attributes. http://jsfiddle.net/y6eLt/
[09:13:09] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I have a <div> that I cloned from a visible part of the page.  When I inspect the height of this <div> it is zero.  How do I find the height when it becomes visible -- without it first becoming visible?
[09:14:36] <airdem> jqueryUI does not seem to work in jsFiddle, am i wrong?
[09:15:59] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/4rDh7/2/
[09:16:05] <Genesis_> could someone help me understand this code?
[09:16:19] <Genesis_> basically, its getting every single video by that person
[09:16:26] <Genesis_> my goal is to just get the latest video
[09:16:55] <Genesis_> how could I, from ajax, extract only the first?
[09:17:32] <Genesis_> I assume the issue is tha in show_my_videos
[09:17:37] <Genesis_> it is doing it on ".each"?
[09:18:50] <decx> add max-results=1 to your youtube url
[09:19:30] <Genesis_> thank you!
[09:19:35] <decx> that way you still can process more videos with the same show_my_videos code
[09:20:03] <Genesis_> thank you very much
[09:20:09] <Genesis_> and I assume if I didn't want to have a LI
[09:20:16] <Genesis_> I would simply remove those tags
[09:20:19] <Genesis_> do an append or something
[09:20:47] <decx> yep, just change the "template"
[09:21:26] <decx> it's a bit strange though, using arrays for a template
[09:21:35] <decx> then again, i heard it'S faster than fragments
[09:24:53] <lexbuck> This doesn't appear to be working: https://dpaste.de/p9Qd. Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong? I thought it was working at one time.
[09:39:39] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck can you make that sample work in a fiddle?
[09:39:46] <duch_kazatel> not sure what "imgsFiltered" is supposed to be.
[09:41:43] <duch_kazatel> http://www.ie6death.com/
[09:44:56] <Varun_krishna> Hi all I am using  phonegap 3.x and jquery mobile for  developing a windows 8 app,. when I run it in android it is working fine, however when I run it on visual studio 2012 I am getting this error 0x800a138f - JavaScript runtime error: Unable to set property 'mobile' of undefined or null reference what am I missing could anyone please help me out here?
[09:44:59] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Sorry, here's the rest of the js: https://dpaste.de/3PSN. I don't know that I can reproduce in fiddle. What's happening is user submits a URL and that URL is then crawled and any images it finds is returned. Jquery grabs all images, puts them into "imgsFiltered" if they are above a certain height and width and then displays them on the page. If no images in imgsFiltered, then it should show the "no-images" div and .remove the "choose-image"
[09:44:59] <lexbuck> div
[09:46:53] <Fishy> $(this).parent().parent().siblings().last().children().last() ... Too much?
[09:50:42] <duch_kazatel> Fishy yes
[09:51:10] <Fishy> Make you cry a little?
[09:51:17] <duch_kazatel> yes D:
[09:51:36] <decx> that's no traversal, that's a travesty
[09:51:38] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck so your issue is just with that if check?
[09:51:51] <Gmac_> in a click event why does this return undefined?
[09:51:52] <Gmac_> var theid ='#' +  $(this).next().find(".evcal_gmaps").attr('id');
[09:52:12] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ because that's not matching anything.
[09:52:17] <airdem> how do i pass params to functions that are defined inside a var?
[09:52:25] <Gmac_> but it is. i even tried it in the chrome console and it finds it
[09:52:25] <duch_kazatel> airdem example?
[09:52:40] <airdem> var func = function() {}; $(el).click(func); how can i pass a param to func?
[09:52:54] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ are you doing this in a doc ready or in a window load?
[09:53:00] <duch_kazatel> airdem fun(param) ?
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> * func(param)
[09:53:05] <Gmac_> doc ready
[09:53:21] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ and the document is valid?
[09:53:25] <Gmac_> yeah
[09:53:32] <airdem> var func = function(param) { console.log(param); }; $(el).click(func(param)); just like that?
[09:53:34] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: that's correct. Everything else works fine, it's just that if no images are found in imgFiltered array, it's supposed to .show the "no-imags" div which it's not doing.
[09:53:44] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: I thought I had it working at one point, but not now
[09:53:56] <duch_kazatel> airdem did you try?
[09:54:10] <airdem> i can remember that this is not correct, trying right now
[09:54:17] <Gmac_> ok i took it out of a settimeout and it starting wokring
[09:54:18] <bobson1234> How can when you delete a character from a text area that the current word either start with a @ or starts with a { and ends with a } it will delete that entire word?
[09:54:42] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ $(this) will get broken by timeouts - that's your issue.
[09:54:52] <Gmac_> poo
[09:54:56] <Gmac_> how can i fix it
[09:55:02] <duch_kazatel> don't use timeouts ;)
[09:55:04] <Gmac_> pass this into the settimeout
[09:55:25] <duch_kazatel> airdem are you just trying to define a function?
[09:55:46] <Gmac_> i need to. I'm using a plugin that renders google maps. staidly it does not render well if the div holding it is invisible so on opening the div i want to resize the map
[09:55:55] <Gmac_> but if i do it too fast it doesn't work
[09:56:54] <airdem> duch_kazatel, i have created a custom function inside a variable to be able to use is as a click event. $('a').click(myfunction); now i need to pass an argument to that function
[09:57:09] <duch_kazatel> airdem you can't in cases like that.
[09:57:32] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ you need to use a callback on their end.
[09:57:46] <Gmac_> if only they gave one....grrr
[09:58:02] <Gmac_> if i don't hide the div the map shows perfectly
[09:58:06] <bl4ckdu5t> Where can I find a plugin that does exactly this http://www.tn3gallery.com/tn3-download/
[09:58:17] <airdem> thats sad
[09:58:24] <Gmac_> maybe i should hide the div after th page loads? but then people might glimpse it
[09:58:28] <bl4ckdu5t> I've seen other connected carousels like jcarousel but I prefer this
[09:59:35] <airdem> how do you call functions that got defined inside a variable?
[10:00:05] <duch_kazatel> airdem that's... not what that is.
[10:00:34] <santiissopasse> is there an event for when the url changes? I have a script that gets injected into a page when it first loads and I want it to run everytime the user clicks a link that changes the url e.g. user is on youtube.com and clicks ona  video, the url is now youtube.com/watch?23d13e
[10:00:35] <airdem> var foo = function() { bar; }; this has no specific name?
[10:00:46] <duch_kazatel> airdem the issue is how you're calling it in on.
[10:01:13] <duch_kazatel> santiissopasse yes - history.popState
[10:01:27] <duch_kazatel> santiissopasse and there's also onHashChange
[10:01:47] <santiissopasse> duch_kazatel: doesnt onHashChange only work if there's a hash?
[10:02:24] <duch_kazatel> santiissopasse correct.  if you're hoping to support ie 9 and below, you'll need to setup a fallback.  hashes are one way to do that.
[10:02:45] <santiissopasse> duch_kazatel: its just for a chrome extension for now
[10:03:00] <duch_kazatel> santiissopasse all right, then history.popState should do it iirc.
[10:03:12] <duch_kazatel> airdem you can't pass arguments when you do $(selector)on('click', functionName);
[10:03:21] <santiissopasse> duch_kazatel: im seeing window.popstate, is that different? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.onpopstate
[10:04:54] <airdem> duch_kazatel, think ive found a way
[10:06:02] <duch_kazatel> airdem hrm?
[10:06:16] <airdem> duch_kazatel, $("some selector").click({param1: "Hello", param2: "World"}, cool_function);
[10:06:28] <airdem> now i can access it via event.data.param1
[10:06:32] <duch_kazatel> santiissopasse sorry, yes that's the right one.
[10:06:46] <santiissopasse> duch_kazatel: weird, popstate works on the Mozilla js docs but not on youtube
[10:07:15] <duch_kazatel> airdem http://api.jquery.com/click/#click-eventData-handlereventObject
[10:07:16] <duch_kazatel> that works.
[10:07:42] * airdem is happy again.
[10:12:40] <BillCriswell> Redbull and a banana for lunch.
[10:12:51] <duch_kazatel> sounds badass.
[10:12:58] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I have $n = $('.move');  If I insert $n in a different place, will that remove if from it's original place, or will I now have multiple references to the same DOM node?
[10:13:20] <duch_kazatel> _cjm define "insert"
[10:13:55] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Good question...  .append()  ?
[10:14:06] <BillCriswell> var $move = $('.move'); $move.insertAfter('.something'); will take .move and put it after .something.
[10:14:16] <duch_kazatel> _cjm so you're just attaching new ones?
[10:14:29] <duch_kazatel> or are you detaching them and putting them elsehwere?
[10:14:34] <_cjm> BillCriswell, ... and remove if from its original place?
[10:14:50] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Yes.  I need to detach and reattach elsewhere.
[10:15:00] <BillCriswell> _cjm: Yes.
[10:15:07] <_cjm> BillCriswell, Thanks much.
[10:15:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost, but ok.
[10:15:48] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Thanks for the help.  I think BillCriswell  has answered my question.
[10:15:52] <duch_kazatel> ah, yep, insertAfter detaches first.  interesting.
[10:16:05] <BillCriswell> Hmmm.
[10:16:31] <duch_kazatel> or at least "moves" the element - I assume that runs a detach so you don't lose any data associated to the node
[10:17:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/cidadamu/1/edit?html,js,output is what Iw as thinking.
[10:18:00] <BillCriswell> I have the Mario song stuck in my head.
[10:18:41] <decx> dududu-dudu-du-duu
[10:20:46] <BillCriswell> It's brutal.
[10:21:43] <drej> da-na-na-na-nana
[10:21:47] <decx> the earworm is a fickle beast
[10:21:49] <BillCriswell> The only part i know is "Take one step and then again let's do the Mario all together"
[10:21:57] <BillCriswell> but I might be making those words up.
[10:22:05] <drej> what mario song is that
[10:22:15] <duch_kazatel> the tv show isn't it?
[10:22:24] <BillCriswell> http://www.mariowiki.com/Do_the_Mario just looked it up to make sure it's real
[10:22:34] <drej> im not clicking that
[10:22:36] <BillCriswell> Why the fuck would this pop in my head today?
[10:23:06] <decx> man, that show was terrible. still better than the movie though
[10:23:11] <BillCriswell> Haha
[10:23:55] <decx> what was that ridiculous other one called
[10:24:01] <decx> where the guy gets sucked into his tv
[10:24:09] <decx> by the power of the powerglove
[10:24:21] <BillCriswell> I don't recall that one.
[10:24:49] <decx> captain N: the game master
[10:25:37] <BillCriswell> decx: I missed that one ( probably fortunately ).
[10:25:40] <BillCriswell> http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148983/3401477-6234225549-tumbl.gif hahahaha
[10:27:13] <decx> *hey remember those things that were only head in the games? let's give tiny heads instead*
[10:27:21] <decx> them*
[10:27:39] <BillCriswell> http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLC5AxsCAAE_0-X.png:large terrifying
[10:27:44] <BillCriswell> Ok. I'm done with that.
[10:28:10] <decx> ninja, ninja huah
[10:29:13] <BillCriswell> Vanilla Ice said something on twitter about ninja turtles... I should have read more carefully.
[10:29:18] <BillCriswell> I bet it was awesome, though.
[10:30:23] <decx> damnit hackernews. i bet that "The Short Answers To Every Matt Cutts Video" submission is amazing but the site is down
[10:30:50] <BillCriswell> decx: I read through that earlier. It's fucking unbelievable it didn't exist before.
[10:31:16] <duch_kazatel> "Write things on websites."  "don't be a dick."  "don't try to game us."  "use common sense."
[10:31:17] <decx> there's a paste. hn redeemed
[10:31:39] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Precisely.
[10:31:56] <duch_kazatel> my company learned these things the hard way :(
[10:32:19] <BillCriswell> My previous companies SEO policies drove me away.
[10:32:27] <BillCriswell> Well, tactics I guess.
[10:32:39] <decx> i only contract for tech stuff because of the cesspool that seo can be
[10:33:04] <decx> build and they will come
[10:33:56] <BillCriswell> Yes, useful websites do well very in SERPs.
[10:34:00] <BillCriswell> Like... Wikipedia.
[10:34:50] <duch_kazatel> in our case, we had one or two bad apples ruining it for the bunch.  we're recovering, but holy hell when your rep tells you "panda will not destroy your business" and then it happens anyway, wait a little bit before assuming they lied.
[10:35:23] <hinbody> I'm having an issue with jqm: I'm using jquery smartmenus and when I click on a link in the menu, it goes to the page but is blank; once I refresh it, it's fine
[10:35:54] <hinbody> unfortunately, I'm not able to share my code, which I know will limit the help I get, just wondering if someone could give me a clue as to where to look
[10:37:35] <duch_kazatel> hinbody any errors in the console?
[10:39:18] <hinbody> duch_kazatel: no. Firefox gives me 'empty string passed to getElementById()' but it seems that's an issue with FF
[10:39:28] <hinbody> at least that's what I gathered from searching for it
[10:39:40] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, is there any valid situation to use eval() at all?
[10:40:31] <hinbody> duch_kazatel: Chrome console even shows all the html that's supposed to be there; just doesn't show up on the page until I refresh the browser
[10:40:48] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:40:54] <chrislabeard> Has anyone every had any issues with retina screens and skrollr causing stuttering on the animations? Not sure how to fix it.
[10:41:05] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC not that i have yet to find in common use.
[10:41:27] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I have a node and I want to discover his index position within his set of siblings.  $n.parent().index($n)  seems like the correct expression, but all I get is -1, indicating that I'm confusing jQuery.  Any advice?
[10:41:59] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I should be asking you this in the node.js channel. I mislooked. I'm currently using eval() to do some math stuff, after using a bunch of regex matches to assure there's no funky shit in there. Any better suggestions?
[10:42:26] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC don't use eval() - it's slow and often unnecessary. can you provide your use case?
[10:43:28] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I'm cut off from the code since it's on a server I can't access from this location (and VPN is down for maintenance). What I'm using it for is to process a math formula.
[10:43:54] <NicholasC> i.e. "3+6/(2+1)" goes in, and I want 5 out.
[10:44:28] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC i can't see why you think you need eval for that.
[10:45:11] <NicholasC> Any alternative suggestions I could consider?
[10:45:27] <duch_kazatel> algebra?
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> sorry, but i don't see why you thing you need eval for a simple equation.
[10:46:34] <NicholasC> That was a simple example: the calculator front-end allows more complex calculations than that
[10:46:52] <duch_kazatel> _cjm http://jsfiddle.net/Ks4GG/
[10:47:46] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC without seeing what you're doing, i'd still have to say that eval() is the wrong way to approach it.
[10:47:52] <BillCriswell> animation-delay is being a jerk right now.
[10:48:04] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.  i'm sure somebody else can give a valid way to use eval() in that instance.
[10:48:55] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I do think it works well here, but the mathjs library effectively does the same, so I might as well use that.
[10:49:40] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Thanks very much.  index() is a property of the node, not of the parent...  This helps a lot.
[10:52:58] <_cjm> Hi Folks, $a and $b are siblings.  $a.parent() === $b.parent()  should be true, according to my thinking, but console says otherwise.  Any advice?
[10:53:10] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it.
[10:55:42] <BillCriswell> _cjm: $a.parent()[0] === $b.parent()[0], jQuery objects are all unique as far as I know?
[10:56:02] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/Ks4GG/
[10:56:30] <_cjm> BillCriswell, Smokin'!  Yes. That's the answer.
[10:56:32] <BillCriswell> You'd have to compare the raw dom node, not the jQuery object _cjm.
[10:58:09] <_cjm> BillCriswell, Thanks very much.  This was a subtly that had escaped me.
[11:00:01] <BillCriswell> No problemo!
[11:00:55] <drej> BillCriswell, itemizing subtleties since 1995
[11:01:41] <d0de> In this code, pauseInterval gets cleared correctly, but the next time the function is called, it fires twice per second instead of once, and the next time three times per second, etc. Can anyone work out why? http://hastebin.com/ribekuxiyu.js
[11:18:42] <aniasis> hello
[11:19:04] <aniasis> s anyone aware of the fact that when you press the back button or 'view source' in Chrome it sends an accepts header of application/json?
[11:19:27] <duch_kazatel> aniasis only if the last request fired from that page was for an ajax json dealio iirc.
[11:19:43] <BillCriswell> Huh, that's interesting.
[11:20:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll see it when people tie pushstates to the URL of the ajax'd content.
[11:20:22] <duch_kazatel> the back button calls the API endpoint, instead of the actual data for the page.
[11:20:29] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:22:18] <ciss> i'm planning to implement a simple ui that allows to scale and move an iframe content (via css transform). i was wondering: can you think of any libraries/plugins that i could build upon?
[11:23:30] <earthian> Hello, according to jquery docs, .toggle(handler, handler) is deprecated in 1.8 and removed in 1.9. However the site did not mention what to use instead in 1.10+(2.1). Could you suggest a way to achieve the same in 2.1: same behaviour as .hover(anim1,anim2) but with a click, toggling between the animations?
[11:24:25] <duch_kazatel> earthian depends on the case.  i always suggest you set a class or some data on the node and check that when running your code.
[11:24:33] <aniasis> duch_kazatel, hmm so there is no way to know whether the request was made from the back button?
[11:25:02] <duch_kazatel> aniasis nope.  was my description pretty apt to your problem though?
[11:25:34] <duch_kazatel> i always suggest that folks not do that and instead tie the URL to the page itself.  the API endpoint url shouldn't match imo.
[11:25:34] <aniasis> duch_kazatel, yes
[11:26:10] <aniasis> duch_kazatel, so you suggest using a client-side router
[11:26:24] <duch_kazatel> I suggest using a different URL for pages then for API endpoints.
[11:26:30] <duch_kazatel> that's my suggestion.
[11:26:50] <duch_kazatel> *than
[11:27:07] <aniasis> ok
[11:28:45] <KamiNuvini> Hello.. I want to use bootstrap selectpicker with data-<name> attributes, however because of the way selectpicker works this is not possible, instead I have to place some html in data-content with the data-attributes. However when I try to do this via jquery it automatically escapes some of the HTML. How can I disable this escaping? I have a jsfiddle here, http://jsfiddle.net/5mXNv/ (if you do /show after the
[11:28:47] <KamiNuvini> URL and check the source you can see it isbeing escaped)
[11:30:13] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini i assume you want "myVar" to just be HTML?
[11:30:41] <KamiNuvini> indeed, everything there should be html
[11:30:59] <KamiNuvini> but only the part inside data-content appears to be escaped
[11:32:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaah, you have markup inside of your data attribute.  hrm.
[11:33:05] <KamiNuvini> it is supposedly the way to go: http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/ (ctrl F "insert custom HTML )
[11:34:00] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5mXNv/1/
[11:34:02] <duch_kazatel> why not do this?
[11:37:11] <KamiNuvini> That doesn't seem to work for me, duch_kazatel ? http://jsfiddle.net/5mXNv/1/show/ source only shows the value, none of the data, is that correct?
[11:37:34] <duch_kazatel> .data() attaches data to a node, not an attribute.
[11:38:09] <duch_kazatel> perhapos we're crossing lines here - why do you need to attach HTML like that?
[11:40:23] <KamiNuvini> I have a table with lots of users and the last column of that table is "Action", which is a dropdown. Each option in the dropdown menu should have certain options (data related to that table row user) so when an option is selected I can get the relevant variables and use them for further processing (which in my case is doing a post request to the server)
[11:40:59] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with attaching html to your option?
[11:42:52] <KamiNuvini> well the data that makes up the table is requested when loading the page and is received through json, which I use to generate the tables. So say I have a user, I click the dropdown and do "Kick", I want to send the username variable (the user that has to be kicked) as part of the post data
[11:43:25] <KamiNuvini> so I do $('#selectgroup').change(function() { var username = $(this).data('username')
[11:43:56] <earthian> duch_kazatel: here is an example of what I am trying to achieve: http://jsfiddle.net/D25DG/1/ but by using "mouse click on h2 tag"
[11:44:27] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini okay - none of that has to do with html thouygh, so i'm still lost.
[11:44:53] <duch_kazatel> earthian where are you trying to use that?
[11:45:02] <duch_kazatel> earthian you mean instead of $("#menu .panelblock").hover(  ?
[11:45:06] <earthian> yes
[11:45:22] <duch_kazatel> earthian okay - did you look at .on() in the docs at all?
[11:45:25] <earthian> in 1.8 $(...).toggle(anim1, anim2) would work
[11:45:28] <earthian> but that was deprecated
[11:45:34] <earthian> not yet
[11:45:43] <earthian> i looked in .click()
[11:45:55] <duch_kazatel> earthian .click() is the same as .on('click'
[11:46:04] <duch_kazatel> you want .on('click', function() {});
[11:46:38] <earthian> duch_kazatel: but I need two functions - one for showing the contents and another hiding. and by hiding/showing, I mean resizing...
[11:47:06] <duch_kazatel> earthian did you even try?
[11:47:09] <earthian> so.. I need toggle(function(){}, function(){}) but it was removed
[11:47:15] <duch_kazatel> no, you don't.
[11:47:21] <earthian> hmm
[11:47:22] <duch_kazatel> one sec let me show you.
[11:48:01] <duch_kazatel> i all ready told you how to do it, so i'm not sure what you're not grasping.  i'll bake up a simple example.
[11:48:37] <earthian> I am not sure how to make it with two animation functions on odd and even clicks
[11:48:49] <duch_kazatel> i told you how ;) one sec.
[11:49:16] <KamiNuvini> I'm not sure which part is confusing you duch, I just want to be able to access some variables I need when an option is selected through the dropdown menu, for which I wanted to use data-* attributes so I can easily access them (this.attr('username')) - The reason why it is in a span inside data-content and not directly as data-* attributes is because the selectpicker plugin processes and breaks/deletes them
[11:49:18] <KamiNuvini> (silly plugin), so I cannot access them directly :<
[11:49:24] <KamiNuvini> I'll try it out with the other method you suggested
[11:49:31] <ciss> earthian: a simple flag variable in a closure, or alternatively a flag set using .data()
[11:49:33] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini then set variables, don't set HTML.
[11:50:07] <KamiNuvini> duch_kazatel: There's a variable number of items in the table, am I supposed to manually set variables for each one?
[11:50:15] <earthian> ok
[11:50:29] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini without seeing what you're doing, i'm not sure what your issue is, but attaching html to data like that is very strange.
[11:50:30] <ciss> KamiNuvini: just to be sure: you can use .attr(), but you can't use .data()?
[11:50:53] <KamiNuvini> I can't use either ciss because of the selectpicker plugin
[11:51:01] <KamiNuvini> (that's why I'm trying this workaround)
[11:51:06] <KamiNuvini> but it's escaping :<
[11:52:15] <ciss> KamiNuvini: that one? http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/
[11:52:29] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini lugging around html like that is a relatively inefficient way to access data.
[11:52:35] <duch_kazatel> that's why i'm wondering why you'd do it that way.
[11:52:46] <ciss> hehe, "relatively" ...
[11:53:45] <KamiNuvini> duch_kazatel: Aah I see the confusion, no - if the way you suggested works I will not attach HTML to data, that was meant as a workaround for the html code itself. I will instead do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5mXNv/2/
[11:53:47] <duch_kazatel> earthian here's a simple way to approach the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/aCuG6/
[11:53:55] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Yes, that's the one
[11:54:17] <duch_kazatel> KamiNuvini why are you wrapping numbers in jquery objects like that?
[11:54:27] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be slow
[11:54:36] <KamiNuvini> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21873370/bootstrap-select-data-attributes that's the issue i'm trying to solve..
[11:54:45] <ciss> KamiNuvini: haven't skimmed through the docs yet, but i'd be very surprised if you couldn't specify a custom callback or event handler
[11:55:27] <dabar> Is there a way to tell .trigger that the handler does not care about the event object?
[11:55:34] <earthian> duch_kazatel: perfect! :)
[11:55:38] <KamiNuvini> <option data-username="username" data-user_id="3" data-session_id="7">Kick User</option> is what I originally wanted to do
[11:55:43] <earthian> So .data did the trick :)
[11:55:45] <duch_kazatel> dabar huh?
[11:55:48] <KamiNuvini> but because selectpicker does not support that I am looking for a workaround
[11:56:02] <earthian> Thank you very much!!
[11:56:17] <dabar> So my function handle_event( e, other_data ) { … } can skip the e in the parameter list?
[11:56:22] <dabar> Like, my handlers don't care about e
[11:56:26] <dabar> Never
[11:56:41] <dabar> It's just making my functions clumsy and chatty
[11:56:54] <KamiNuvini> Does that make more sense, ciss?
[11:56:55] <dabar> I can't reuse the handler outside the context of handling an event
[11:56:59] <dabar> And stuff
[11:57:08] <duch_kazatel> dabar oh, no.  how would your handler know which argument is which object?
[11:57:38] <dabar> If there was a way to tell .trigger: don't send e
[11:57:48] <duch_kazatel> dabar there isn't ;)
[11:57:50] <dabar> Then it would know because of the parameter names as any other thing
[11:57:59] <dabar> Too bad
[11:58:02] <dabar> Thanks
[11:58:06] <duch_kazatel> welcome to javascript.
[11:58:10] <Roboman> Can anyone help me? I'm having trouble with might possibly a bug.
[11:58:16] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Roboman
[11:58:16] <b-ot> Roboman: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:58:27] <dabar> I bet I could adjust .trigger to just not do that
[11:58:40] <dabar> I will look under the covers a bit.
[11:58:46] <Roboman> Sorry, okay. event.preventDefault() Doesn't prevent the default for tab.
[11:59:01] <duch_kazatel> Roboman okay.
[11:59:10] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Roboman
[11:59:10] <b-ot> Roboman: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:59:24] <Roboman> On it.
[12:00:21] <ciss> KamiNuvini: what exactly happens when an option gets selected?
[12:00:39] <hinbody> duch_kazatel: I figured out my problem. The guy before me checked for $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] with !isset
[12:00:47] <duch_kazatel> Roboman also, what happens if you use stopImmediatePropagation
[12:00:51] <hinbody> I just changed that to isset and now it works
[12:01:00] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Hold on, I'll create a more clear example to explain what I'm doing and how data is presented :)
[12:01:13] <Roboman> e.stopImmediatePropagation?
[12:01:32] <duch_kazatel> Roboman e or event, however you're passing the event object.
[12:01:37] <Roboman> Right, I'm using e.
[12:01:49] <duch_kazatel> so it was e.preventDefault() ?
[12:01:57] <duch_kazatel> then it would be e.stopimmediatepropagation()
[12:02:02] <duch_kazatel> try that sucker and see what happens.
[12:02:35] <ciss> KamiNuvini: btw (don't know if you noticed), the val() function is exposed: https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select/blob/master/bootstrap-select.js#L37
[12:03:21] <Roboman> duch_kazatel I'll try that, give me a few minutes to debug.
[12:03:24] <printForever> duch_kazatel, are you here
[12:03:36] <duch_kazatel> printForever i'm kicking around.
[12:03:59] <printForever> duch_kazatel you are my only hope Obi One Kenobi
[12:04:13] <printForever> *Wan
[12:04:33] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[12:05:19] <Roboman> Does jsbin support jQuery?
[12:05:27] <Roboman> Never mind, got it
[12:05:32] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:05:38] <printForever> I used this little jQuery plugin, called jPulse, but it seems there is a problem with it https://github.com/DavisMiculis/jPulse/issues/3
[12:05:46] <ciss> duch_kazatel: what about the occasional "return false" voodoo? is that actually required when preventDefault() or stopImmediatePropagation() is used?
[12:06:06] <duch_kazatel> ciss nope.
[12:06:14] <Roboman> Thats another question I had, is there a need for return false?
[12:06:22] <duch_kazatel> you can use one or the other, but you don't have to use both.
[12:06:23] <ciss> Roboman: see above :D
[12:06:30] <duch_kazatel> and it would just be for preventDefault()
[12:06:33] <Roboman> Yeah, can't type fast enough
[12:06:37] <duch_kazatel> stopImmediatePropagation() is a different beast.
[12:06:59] <ciss> didn't that one imply preventDefault()? *looks at docs*
[12:07:22] <duch_kazatel> oh, shit you're right.
[12:07:24] <duch_kazatel> out of it today
[12:07:43] <duch_kazatel> printForever okay... and?
[12:07:50] <printForever> duch_kazatel is there a chance this could be fixed
[12:08:08] <printForever> when you glance over the plugin
[12:08:10] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Something like this is what I want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/985J6/2/
[12:08:20] <duch_kazatel> printForever uh, sure.  the dude provided a fork with a fix here: https://github.com/neeraj91/jPulse
[12:08:28] <printForever> it doesent work, either
[12:08:38] <KamiNuvini> Does that make sense?
[12:08:42] <duch_kazatel> printForever i'm not sure what you're asking.  what does this plugin even do?
[12:09:15] <printForever> duch_kazatel it gives a pulsating circle to the element (under the element)
[12:09:33] <duch_kazatel> printForever okay.  why not build your own?
[12:09:33] <ciss> Roboman: looks like a good source on the topic: http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[12:09:42] <Roboman> Thanks ciss
[12:10:30] <printForever> duch_kazatel well I wouldnt know where to start
[12:10:38] <printForever> never wrote a jQuery plugin before
[12:10:51] <duch_kazatel> javascript doesn't require you to return from functions - using it to prevent default behavior was always a strange idea to me.
[12:11:06] <duch_kazatel> printForever then learn?  i'm not sure what you want from me here.
[12:11:11] <ciss> KamiNuvini: yes. can you still bind a change handler?
[12:11:11] <Roboman> Do you mean jQuery, or javascript?
[12:11:20] <duch_kazatel> Roboman jquery IS javascript.
[12:11:40] <Roboman> True.
[12:11:43] <duch_kazatel> when you call a function in jquery, it's like calling it with any other javascript.
[12:11:45] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Yes, why not? :)
[12:12:07] <KamiNuvini> I bind the handler on the .done of the function that renders the table
[12:12:11] <printForever> duch_kazatel I wanted to ask you if you can check the plugin and maybe locate the problem
[12:12:15] <ciss> KamiNuvini: because i'm not aware of how selectpicker works. apparently it's a replacement/overlay
[12:12:22] <duch_kazatel> printForever no, I cannot, since i am at work.
[12:12:28] <duch_kazatel> and that's kind of out of the scope of this channel.
[12:12:47] <Roboman> printForever Thats asking a bit much... asking someone to try and fix a buggy plugin that they've never heard of before can be a large task.
[12:12:55] <printForever> if anyone can take a look, I wouldnt know where to start with this
[12:12:56] <printForever> https://github.com/DavisMiculis/jPulse/blob/master/jQuery.jPulse.js
[12:13:01] <KamiNuvini> Ah yes, that does work ciss - I can console.log the value and it reports correctly when I select different options
[12:13:09] <duch_kazatel> printForever i can help you with questions that might come up about how to use certain methods, or maybe where to start, and while this would be relatively trivial, you're kind of overstepping.
[12:13:16] <duch_kazatel> printForever you'll never learn if you don't start.
[12:13:17] <ciss> KamiNuvini: why don't you set the user id on the select itself?
[12:13:53] <KamiNuvini> I can do that, I thought it would require me to mess with .parent() and such, which is why I didn't do it initally
[12:13:57] <printForever> duch_kazatel any help on this topic would be appreciated
[12:13:57] <duch_kazatel> printForever i'll assume you were the one who submitted the issue?  because the author replied.
[12:14:18] <printForever> yes, and it wasnt the author it was a forker
[12:14:43] <duch_kazatel> they're a contributor
[12:15:38] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/neeraj91/jPulse/commit/29d7d837b1eca735df409a038f857e52c3b1a2f6
[12:15:45] <duch_kazatel> that's the file they modified btw.
[12:16:12] <duch_kazatel> not the minified version.
[12:16:28] <printForever> that was the problem then
[12:17:22] <duch_kazatel> in the future, you can see what the last commit was by clicking on this: http://i.imgur.com/JiN1w7P.png
[12:17:33] <duch_kazatel> that will show you the files they changed.
[12:17:42] <earthian> duch_kazatel: that code you gave me.. it is not working in my script :( it is not "firing" when I click for the second time... the function is not being executed... any ideas why? maybe some timeout is involved?
[12:17:45] <ciss> KamiNuvini: http://jsfiddle.net/985J6/4/
[12:17:45] <printForever> duch_kazatel you were very helpful :)
[12:18:01] <duch_kazatel> earthian jsfiddle your new code please.
[12:18:11] <earthian> one sec.
[12:18:13] <Roboman> duch_kazatel All right, I have something replicating my issue: http://jsbin.com/wakokife/1/
[12:18:16] <duch_kazatel> print sure.  in the future, either work with the author, or learn to try to submit a PR yourself.
[12:18:30] <duch_kazatel> err, printForever
[12:18:43] <printForever> duch_kazatel what is a good minifier for js?
[12:18:51] <duch_kazatel> Roboman sorry, what was the original problem?
[12:19:03] <printForever> duch_kazatel yeah, I will have that in mind. sorry for bugging you with this
[12:19:19] <Roboman> I'm trying to stop the brower from tabbing from one textbox to another; I'm trying to use tab for a different function.
[12:19:22] <duch_kazatel> i like uglifyjs personally.  search around for ones that suit your needs.
[12:19:30] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Ugh, yeah.. that was a suprisingly easy fix... works in selectpicker as well. I thought it had to be on the option itself to use $(this)
[12:19:34] <duch_kazatel> Roboman oooh.  hrmmm.
[12:19:36] <earthian> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/D25DG/2/
[12:19:49] <KamiNuvini> Thanks ciss, worked perfectly
[12:20:07] <ciss> KamiNuvini: wouldn't make much sense, since you're querying the value from a *select* ;)
[12:20:14] <ciss> KamiNuvini: np
[12:20:19] <duch_kazatel> Roboman that's... not going to work.
[12:20:48] <Roboman> Would you mind explaining? I'm "relatively" new to JQ.
[12:20:57] <KamiNuvini> ciss: Just a question, what'd you mean with the val being exposed?
[12:21:25] <duch_kazatel> prevent default behavior of keypresses is a big pain in the ass with JS in general.
[12:21:30] <ciss> KamiNuvini: selectpicker exposes some internal functions. check the link i gave you
[12:21:43] <ciss> (not that it bears any relevance now)
[12:21:56] <duch_kazatel> earthian that's because panelblock.data('d') === 1 will never be true.
[12:22:02] <Roboman> Is there another way I can accomplish having the browser not tab to the next input box?
[12:22:44] <earthian> duch_kazatel: is that because I changed "odd/even" to 0/1 ?
[12:23:33] <Roboman> Ah-hmmm. I got it working before with other keys besides tab... strange.
[12:23:59] <duch_kazatel> earthian it's because you're doing some very strange things - contents.replaceWith(contents.html()); is breaking stuff
[12:24:20] <earthian> ohh... that thing is measuring the height of the contents of that div
[12:24:41] <duch_kazatel> you're breaking things on your own.
[12:24:47] <Roboman> duch_kazatel: In the same JSBin, I have it working for any key except for tab (and other undiscovered keys)
[12:24:48] <ciss> Roboman: http://jsfiddle.net/s7Tbx/
[12:25:20] <Roboman> ciss: Thats a javascript keycode identifier, I have another one open
[12:25:29] <Roboman> I do however notice that "tab" doesn't pull up a keycode
[12:25:35] <duch_kazatel> Roboman check var keyCode = e.keyCode || e.which;
[12:25:45] <ciss> Roboman: it's to demonstrate that you can't capture tab
[12:25:57] <Roboman> ciss Dammit
[12:26:15] <duch_kazatel> oddly enough - http://jsbin.com/wakokife/1/edit
[12:26:18] <duch_kazatel> that works for me in FF.
[12:26:44] <ciss> duch_kazatel: not in chrome
[12:26:51] <duch_kazatel> aye.
[12:27:01] <Roboman> Yes, this needs to work across browsers, this will be a public build.
[12:27:02] <ciss> haven't tried keydown yet ...
[12:27:12] <duch_kazatel> Roboman i wouldn't do this anyway.
[12:27:14] <Roboman> I'll try keydown right now
[12:27:23] <ciss> seems to work
[12:27:24] <Roboman> duch_kazatel What would you suggest then?
[12:27:30] <ciss> (to some degree)
[12:27:41] <duch_kazatel> Roboman why are you trying to break default tab behavior?  because this will make people with limited mobility have an extremely hard time using your site.
[12:28:03] <Roboman> duch_kazatel I'm building a chat website, and this will be hooked up to the actual chat box
[12:28:11] <Roboman> This behavior is meant to be able to autocomplete usernames
[12:28:28] <Roboman> ciss Keydown does seem to work... hmmm.
[12:28:48] <duch_kazatel> Roboman just be aware that blind users won't be able to use your stuff then.
[12:29:05] <ciss> yep: http://jsfiddle.net/s7Tbx/2/
[12:29:25] <Roboman> duch_kazatel: Blind users... how are blind users supposed to be able to use a chat website anyway (without a text to speech plugin installed)?
[12:29:34] <duch_kazatel> they use screen readers.
[12:29:36] <Roboman> Tbh, I'm not worried about blind people yet :/
[12:29:41] <duch_kazatel> which are much more advanced than you're thing.
[12:29:41] <ciss> or a text to speech plugin :D
[12:30:14] <duch_kazatel> earthian your html is very unusual.
[12:30:25] <duch_kazatel> *javascript i mean.
[12:30:34] <Roboman> ciss: Its working!
[12:30:36] <earthian> I am trying to fix it.. and I think I might know how.
[12:30:45] <Roboman> http://jsbin.com/wakokife/4/
[12:31:01] <ciss> Roboman: see my fiddle above ;)
[12:31:14] <Roboman> ciss: Yup, this is just my implementation
[12:31:31] <Roboman> Do you think its a bug that I should submit? JQuery should be able to catch Tab through keypress.
[12:32:14] <ciss> Roboman: if it's chrome specific, check chrome's issue queue
[12:32:32] <Roboman> Yeah, I'll go look at that. Thanks for all the help!
[12:32:54] <ciss> also, i'm not up to date on the ecma events. is keypress standard or jquery?
[12:33:38] <Roboman> Not sure, as aforementioned I'm new to JQuery
[12:33:53] <duch_kazatel> keypress is standard.
[12:33:57] <ciss> yep
[12:33:59] <ciss> just checked
[12:34:09] <duch_kazatel> keypress vs keydown.
[12:34:10] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[12:34:10] <ciss> with all the custom jquery events you never know for sure :D
[12:34:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?  like what?
[12:35:16] <ciss> e.g. hover()
[12:35:35] <ciss> wait, bad example
[12:35:59] <duch_kazatel> this is why i almost always use .on()
[12:37:09] <ciss> mouseenter / mouseleave: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_mouse.html#mouseenter
[12:37:12] <earthian> duch_kazatel: I fixed the code by putting html div with css height property "auto" so that it wraps around the contents. However now i call .panelblock with a .parent().parent() call... should I just use single .parent(".panelblock") instead?
[12:37:40] <ciss> (not exactly "custom", but close)
[12:37:53] <duch_kazatel> earthian use https://api.jquery.com/parents/
[12:38:10] <duch_kazatel> ciss i think you mean that jquery normalizes events.
[12:38:57] <ciss> duch_kazatel: i'll admit i didn't expect i'd be having such a hard time finding a good example
[12:39:14] <berpcor> http://laravel.io/bin/36RP
[12:39:22] <ciss> in the end i might even have to admit i have been wrong *gasp*
[12:39:34] <duch_kazatel> hell no!  this is jquery dammit!
[12:40:03] <duch_kazatel> berpcor can you supply a version in plain old javascript without coffeescript?
[12:40:39] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: Minute...
[12:41:16] <earthian> all cool. Thank you very much for all your effort to support me :)
[12:41:22] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[12:42:46] <berpcor> The code is real mess... Nevertheless - http://laravel.io/bin/e6we
[12:43:07] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue here?
[12:43:21] <berpcor> I can't understand where is the problem: php framework or jquery...
[12:43:29] <duch_kazatel> what's the problem?
[12:44:03] <berpcor> I insert content I get from controller in div. But in one case I see it in div. In another case I can't see it.
[12:44:22] <duch_kazatel> are you getting any errors in the console?
[12:44:53] <duch_kazatel> are you talking about line 3?
[12:45:07] <berpcor> No.
[12:45:30] <berpcor> Lines 4 and 11
[12:45:44] <berpcor> If I use line 4 in php then I can't see content.
[12:45:59] <berpcor> If I use line 11 in php then I see the content
[12:46:12] <duch_kazatel> huh?  one sets some css and the other is a URL for your ajax post.
[12:46:41] <duch_kazatel> berpcor unless you're looking at your coffeescript, in which case, good luck.
[12:47:40] <duch_kazatel> i need to get lunch.  enjoy folks.
[12:58:22] <d0de> I have the strangest problem. This code works perfectly the first time, but when timedPauseButton is clicked the second time, updatePauseTimer() is called twice per second instead of once. The third time, 3 times per second, and so on. I've been tearing my hair out trying to work out what's going on. Can anyone suggest? http://hastebin.com/nixonuviho.js
[13:02:21] <drej> youre probably rebinding the click event every time
[13:02:54] <d0de> well it turns out that putting a configInputButton.unbind( 'click ') in timedPausePrompt() fixes the problem
[13:03:16] <d0de> drej: lol, yeah, looks like you're right
[13:03:45] <d0de> It's just a little strange because I've never run into this problem before and I think I've used similar code lots of times
[13:05:25] <hwamokp66> I'm trying to make the portfolio pictures in this page to pop up for a bigger picture. The template came with somethign called Magnific-Popup instead of the typical fancybox taht i use
[13:05:38] <hwamokp66> i thought i followed the insturctions right but it just goes to a diff page with the pic :  http://test2.hpcreatives.net/portfolio-full-width.html
[13:13:37] <Hypnotizes> is there a channel for law of domain names
[13:14:28] <d0de> Hypnotizes, I would ask that question in #dns
[13:15:01] <Hypnotizes> okay
[13:16:50] <hwamokp66>  I'm trying to make the portfolio pictures in this page to pop up for a bigger picture. The template came with somethign called Magnific-Popup instead of the typical fancybox taht i use

[13:19:44] <BillCriswell> location.search is weird.
[13:20:48] <ankurk_> I am trying to merge two columns with same text, but it's not working :( http://jsbin.com/yucihoru/1/edit
[13:21:02] <duch_kazatel> why do you say that, BillCriswell?
[13:21:35] <BillCriswell> If there's just a "?" at the end of the url some browsers return a blank string, others the question mark.
[13:21:41] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: That fiddle is empty?
[13:24:17] <BillCriswell> url/? -> Chrome: location.search // "", IE9: location.search // "?"
[13:24:27] <BillCriswell> url/?foo -> Chrome: location.search // "?foo", IE9: location.search // "?foo"
[13:24:35] <BillCriswell> Not sure which browser I agree with.
[13:24:35] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[13:24:49] <duch_kazatel> i'd agree with IE in that came imo.
[13:25:05] <duch_kazatel> if only for consistency with window.location.hash
[13:25:43] <BillCriswell> # returns an empty string if there's nothing after it as well... See I think I agree with Chrome.
[13:25:46] <Hypnotizes> d0de: :(
[13:25:47] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i think chrome is doing the standard
[13:25:57] <duch_kazatel> wow, that's a first ;)
[13:26:08] <Cork> well chrome is normally closer then ie
[13:26:19] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you're talking about.
[13:26:34] <duch_kazatel> they're not compliant on pushstates, and IE11 does a really fantastic job of following the spec for caching.
[13:27:02] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well basically there trackrecord isn't to bad
[13:27:09] <Cork> but yes they do a good job on some specs
[13:27:18] <consiglier> hello
[13:27:30] <consiglier> can I get som help here?
[13:27:33] <d0de> Hypnotizes, I really don't know much about ICANN disputes. duch_kazatel, do you know what the first step would be for someone with a trademark-based domain name dispute?
[13:27:35] <BillCriswell> I like that IE gets pissed at the courtesy comma in objects. It pisses off lots of newbies though.
[13:27:53] <duch_kazatel> ask @ consiglier
[13:27:56] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ consiglier
[13:27:56] <b-ot> consiglier: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:27:58] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[13:28:10] <consiglier> ok, sorry
[13:28:13] <consiglier> thanks :)
[13:28:21] <consiglier> I just wrote on stackoverlow
[13:28:29] <consiglier> so, here is the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22946833/jquery-ui-swap-elements-with-draggable-and-droppable
[13:29:08] <consiglier> and working example on jsfiddle
[13:29:15] <consiglier> is http://jsfiddle.net/mHRwB/
[13:30:48] <ankurk_> something is wrong with jsbin and fiddle :/
[13:31:03] <keady_> hey guys. doing an ajax xhr2 form submission with file upload, for some reason the progress function reaches 100 several seconds before the success event is triggered.. is that normal? it looks weird on my UI that the file has progress 100% but it's still actively "working"
[13:35:30] <consiglier> has anyone seen my example?
[13:35:36] <ankurk_> Is there a limit on length of html on jsbin and fiddle?
[13:36:19] <duch_kazatel> consiglier sorry, was eating lunch.  let me poke.
[13:36:29] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: If you have to worry about that I'm a little nervous to look at the example.
[13:37:14] <consiglier> I hope it was a good lunch? :)
[13:37:45] <duch_kazatel> consiglier so to clarify, you're trying to swap two values?
[13:40:34] <duch_kazatel> is anybody else having a hard time understanding consiglier's question?
[13:41:30] <consiglier> Ok, I will try to explain better :)
[13:42:35] <consiglier> I have element 1 with data-place='10' and when drag this element over element 2 with data-place attribute = '15'
[13:42:37] <duch_kazatel> do you mean to say that when I drop 2 onto 3,  3 should have it's data-place set to "15" and 2 should have it's data-place set to "25"?
[13:42:53] <consiglier> Yes duch_kazatel
[13:43:03] <consiglier> that is the right question :)
[13:43:17] <consiglier> And I did it but it works ony once
[13:43:35] <duch_kazatel> first of all, you're mixing a.data("place") and a.attr("data-place", b_place); - just use .data()
[13:43:36] <consiglier> I posted on jsfiddle my code
[13:44:31] <consiglier> ok but I need to set value for data-place, right? thaths why I use a.attr("data-place", b_place)
[13:44:47] <duch_kazatel> consiglier you do that by use .data('place', value');
[13:44:56] <consiglier> ok
[13:45:11] <consiglier> but this is also working
[13:45:18] <consiglier> and only once
[13:45:18] <duch_kazatel> fix it to be consistent first.
[13:45:25] <duch_kazatel> then we'll keep moving forward :)
[13:45:28] <consiglier> ok I will do than now
[13:45:29] <consiglier> :)
[13:46:43] <consiglier> I done it :)
[13:46:53] <consiglier> here is link: http://jsfiddle.net/mHRwB/2/
[13:46:59] <consiglier> is it ok now?
[13:47:05] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:47:10] <duch_kazatel> orward :)
[13:47:10] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:08:13:45:28] <consiglier> ok I will do than now
[13:47:12] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[13:47:21] <duch_kazatel> b.data("data-place", a_place) -> b.data("place", a_place)
[13:47:27] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want
[13:47:43] <consiglier> ohh...
[13:47:50] <consiglier> I see
[13:48:27] <consiglier> http://jsfiddle.net/mHRwB/3/ fixed now? :)
[13:49:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/mHRwB/5/
[13:49:35] <duch_kazatel> seems to work to me.  the swap code is bugged, but otherwise this seems fine.
[13:49:58] <consiglier> ok, what I can do to fix this?
[13:50:17] <duch_kazatel> consiglier again, this seems to work fine.  the swap code is bugged, but it's doing what you want.
[13:50:28] <duch_kazatel> drag one over two, look at console.  do the same thing, values are swapped.
[13:51:12] <consiglier> Yes but at console, when I see in inspect element it is ok
[13:51:16] <consiglier> Yes but at console, when I see in inspect element it is not
[13:51:28] <duch_kazatel> consiglier data is not an attribute.
[13:51:43] <duch_kazatel> consiglier do not inspect the element to confirm - .data() and .attr() are different concepts.
[13:51:53] <consiglier> ok I understand
[13:51:57] <duch_kazatel> trust the console output of .data() and use that.  don't use .attr();
[13:52:03] <duch_kazatel> not in this case, at least.
[13:52:23] <consiglier> ok
[13:52:35] <consiglier> and you are saying that the jQuery.fn.swap funcion is bugged?
[13:52:53] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: Actually I think I solved the issue :P
[13:52:56] <duch_kazatel> if i try to drag 1 over 2, and then 2 over 1, it doesn't seem to work very well.
[13:53:39] <consiglier> why? elements are not changed? or?
[13:53:52] <duch_kazatel> elements do not change, correct.
[13:54:45] <consiglier> well it works to me, when you drag 1 over 2 you will see gray background of 2 and then release the mouse
[13:55:12] <duch_kazatel> consiglier right, and then the boxes don't swap places.
[13:56:00] <consiglier> oh.. try to be more precise :) It has to work, works on my computer :)
[13:56:09] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:56:33] <consiglier> but, do you have another solution maybe for swaping?
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> consiglier nope.
[13:57:25] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Niiice.
[14:01:20] <Caplain> $("#clock").animate({ width: 'calc(70% - 160px)', left: '160px' });
[14:01:36] <Caplain> that doesn't work and its due to the calc bit...but idk what else to do for something like that
[14:02:40] <duch_kazatel> you want width: calc(70% - 160px);
[14:02:43] <duch_kazatel> drop the quotes.
[14:03:43] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, unexpected token
[14:03:57] <Caplain> maybe put quotes around the number bits?
[14:04:07] <duch_kazatel> what does calc do?
[14:04:33] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, http://lexic.silverelitez.org/admin/index.php#
[14:04:42] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't answer my question.
[14:04:55] <Caplain> the bottom part with the clock. if you click navi on the left its supposed to resize the bottom box dynamically
[14:04:58] <duch_kazatel> could you please fiddle calc() ?
[14:05:05] <Caplain> hmm sure
[14:05:11] <Caplain> ill try. never did it before lol
[14:05:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:05:27] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty simple.
[14:05:35] <duch_kazatel> put your javascript in the javascript pane.
[14:07:11] <duch_kazatel> hit "save", paste the link here.
[14:07:20] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/j2YtA/
[14:07:44] <duch_kazatel> Caplain where is calc defined?
[14:08:22] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, i just confused something css with something js. im really sorry
[14:08:29] <Caplain> its now 5pm est. time to stop...
[14:08:29] <duch_kazatel> well ok.
[14:08:44] <duch_kazatel> no big deal ;)
[14:09:01] <Caplain> i guess my next question is...how do i determine ( 70% - 160px ) lol
[14:09:43] <duch_kazatel> you want to do $(elm).height() - 160
[14:09:58] <duch_kazatel> wait, 70% of what?
[14:10:05] <duch_kazatel> is the element 70% of something?
[14:10:49] <Caplain> or $('#main').width() - '30%' - 160
[14:11:23] <duch_kazatel> "30%" is an ephemeral concepot.
[14:11:26] <duch_kazatel> 30% of what?
[14:11:28] <Caplain> the element rests on the bottom and i want it to resize 160px less than its current width to make room for the sliding nav bar on the side when it opens...div overlapping is gross
[14:11:43] <Caplain> 30% is the width of the other element to that elements right
[14:11:53] <duch_kazatel> if you want 160px less than its current with, then you want $(elm).width() - 160
[14:12:08] <Caplain> nav=160px wide, clock=70%-160, title=30%
[14:12:19] <duch_kazatel> and again, you want $(elm).width() - 160
[14:12:24] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, srs?
[14:12:27] <duch_kazatel> percentages are ephemeral concepts.
[14:12:41] <Caplain> can you hold? i need to start drinking early today
[14:12:45] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:12:45] <Caplain> oh yeah
[14:12:51] <Caplain> im tired, don't mind me
[14:14:08] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, 		$("#clock").animate({ width: $("#clock").width() - 160, left: '160px' });
[14:14:12] <Caplain> works like a charm!!!!
[14:14:16] <Caplain> thank you!!! :)
[14:14:21] <duch_kazatel> cache your selectors btw.
[14:14:41] <duch_kazatel> var $clock = $("#clock");
[14:14:45] <duch_kazatel> then use $clock instead
[14:14:54] <Caplain> security reasons, i assume?
[14:15:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:15:03] <duch_kazatel> speed.
[14:15:15] <duch_kazatel> every time you call $(), you're calling a big expensive function.
[14:15:22] <duch_kazatel> reduce calls to it when possible.
[14:15:56] <Caplain> nah there is too much dynamic crap going on in the page. '#blah' maybe one thing one minute and change another minute. i would need to refresh the var in that case, right?
[14:16:08] <obert> very basic question: how to create html on onclick please?
[14:16:17] <Caplain> oh boy!!!
[14:16:19] <duch_kazatel> obert fiddle what you have so far.
[14:16:20] <Caplain> i know this one!!!
[14:16:25] <duch_kazatel> Caplain don't ;)
[14:16:35] <duch_kazatel> Caplain but you should cache at least within your functions.
[14:16:47] <obert> i don't have nothing. atm i got the empty div straight in the markup:p
[14:17:00] <Caplain> onclick='document.getElementById('id').innerHTML = 'blah blah';
[14:17:01] <Caplain> haha
[14:17:06] <duch_kazatel> capeta nooooo :(
[14:17:07] <obert> -.-
[14:17:08] <duch_kazatel> err, Caplain
[14:17:12] <Caplain> but but but
[14:17:15] <Caplain> fine
[14:17:17] <duch_kazatel> obert did you even try?
[14:17:28] <obert> duch_kazatel: come on please
[14:17:39] <duch_kazatel> obert this is trivial - what did you try?
[14:17:48] <Caplain> next you'll be saying i should sanitize my ajax input or something
[14:17:57] <duch_kazatel> welp
[14:17:59] * Caplain goes to find a well-deserved beer
[14:18:03] <obert> duch_kazatel: create html after clicked somewhere
[14:18:06] * BillCriswell escapes
[14:18:16] <duch_kazatel> obert right - what did you try?
[14:18:22] <duch_kazatel> obert show that you at least tried.
[14:18:26] <obert> nothing yet.
[14:18:32] <Caplain> that's asking a lot
[14:18:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qTmdB/
[14:19:05] <obert> how to create html then? $('div') ?
[14:19:06] <Caplain> / put your code here
[14:19:10] <Caplain> that's not very helpful...
[14:19:14] <duch_kazatel> obert nope.
[14:19:32] <Caplain> make html appear in the div? right?
[14:19:40] <duch_kazatel> Caplain please don't hand them the answer.
[14:19:47] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qTmdB/1/
[14:20:06] <duch_kazatel> we have help vampires in here that rarely, if ever, actually try to do anything on their own.
[14:20:08] <obert> duch_kazatel: i am asking here since i don't find the right page in the doc, i won't spend all night in other questions
[14:20:10] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, wouldn't you use some kind of var d1 = document.getElementById('contain');
[14:20:10] <Caplain> 	d1.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', newwindow); ?
[14:20:48] <duch_kazatel> obert this has your answer: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[14:20:50] <duch_kazatel> capeta nope.
[14:20:56] <duch_kazatel> Caplain i mean dammit.
[14:21:06] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, touche. mind you sometimes ill pop in here real quick and ask a question and pop back out again...but in all fairness the site i linked you to i wrote 97% via google...so yeah
[14:21:56] <duch_kazatel> obert come on really?
[14:21:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qTmdB/2/
[14:22:04] <duch_kazatel> this is dead simple stuff.
[14:22:33] <Caplain> for some...but not all. heck i fall asleep thinking about functions and stuff trying to get things right
[14:22:45] <duch_kazatel> Caplain you need to learn tbh.
[14:22:50] <duch_kazatel> code by google is a terrible idea.
[14:23:23] <Caplain> the other day my bf and i were having a personal discussion and i started using css in my analogys...the discussion was about me working on web dev too much...
[14:23:36] <obert> i want to create <div> too
[14:23:38] <Caplain> code by google...sorta... depends on the source
[14:23:42] <duch_kazatel> obert okay, then do it.
[14:23:48] <obert> but yeah i will try something
[14:23:56] <tudda> When I click on a radio button, i'd like to check if it was ALREADY checked previously.  Everything i do in the onclick handler seems to tell me its selected, but that's because it is now selected
[14:23:57] <obert> thanks
[14:24:05] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, should i mention that appending html is much better/smoother?
[14:24:11] <juboba> how can I set a plugin's default option?
[14:24:12] <duch_kazatel> Caplain that should never be 'sorta' or 'depends'
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> Caplain that's what the example i provided does.
[14:24:37] <juboba> I mean, I'm using jeditable and I always have to set the option "blur" to "submit"
[14:25:01] <Caplain> juboba, there is an html option to default select a radio button
[14:25:05] <duch_kazatel> juboba not without setting up some kind of proxy function and calling that instead.  or editing the plugin.
[14:25:06] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, ...how's that?
[14:25:15] <Caplain> not too much help...but enough to help helping
[14:25:21] <duch_kazatel> Caplain http://jsfiddle.net/qTmdB/3/
[14:25:43] <juboba> duch_kazatel, ohh, so it depends on the plugin
[14:25:53] <duch_kazatel> juboba it can, yes.
[14:25:56] <juboba> Caplain, wha?
[14:26:10] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, $(element).destroy(); :D
[14:26:17] <duch_kazatel> Caplain ...
[14:26:41] <Caplain> duch_kazatel, at first i was rewriting the whole html bit by hand cutting out the div i wanted to remove
[14:26:51] <Caplain> i hope i'm at least making your day here
[14:27:12] <duch_kazatel> first: juboba was looking for setting default options in plugins.  second: i was only asked how to add html by somebody who hadn't put in any effort.
[14:27:20] <duch_kazatel> soooo...
[14:27:38] <Caplain> im doing good?
[14:27:40] <Caplain> haha
[14:27:51] <duch_kazatel> Caplain you're kind of trolling.
[14:27:58] <Caplain> actually no :/
[14:28:26] <Caplain> i dont troll on freenode. i know better. dont bite the hand that helps you
[15:03:51] <bklane> I am trying to use the jquery UI sortable but serialize is returning blank strings for me.  Can anyone check out my code and let me know what I'm messing up on, https://gist.github.com/blklane/c70b2ace4414a4f8ca63
[15:05:03] <hxm> hello nice people
[15:05:15] <hxm> i wanted to go to sleep good tonight and I have this http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=vcaJTYFC
[15:05:40] <hxm> i call a page, it requires auth so it redirects me to auth.php, auth.php validates me and then sends me to other 302 statuscode
[15:05:50] <hxm> but that is not being showed in #content, is opened
[15:05:59] <hxm> can I manage many redirects?
[15:08:36] <duch_kazatel> hxm why are you managing redirects?
[15:09:51] <hxm> because in the index I have the nav with many links, I call them trought ajax, if some of them requires authentication the page refuses load until I authenticate
[15:10:02] <hxm> and if I do I right I get back to he page I wanted o see
[15:10:07] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't matter in ajax.
[15:10:18] <duch_kazatel> did you try it without looking at the redirects in play?
[15:11:15] <hxm> yes, same problem, the last page opens in a new window
[15:11:39] <duch_kazatel> fiddle is please.
[15:11:51] <duch_kazatel> *it
[15:13:12] <hxm> better http://ejecutor.bot.eggdrop.es/ Herramientas->visor->demo:demodemo
[15:14:11] <duch_kazatel> $(".nav ul li a").on("click",function() { -> $(".nav ul li a").on("click",function(e) {
[15:14:18] <duch_kazatel> then follow that with e.preventDefault();
[15:32:16] <jsharpminor> I have a fiddle that works perfectly, but fails to trigger the click event in my real site.
[15:32:16] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/
[15:32:33] <jsharpminor> What could prevent that?
[15:32:39] <jsharpminor> No errors are appearing in the console.
[15:32:57] <duch_kazatel> $('#socialTabs').children('div').click(function () - this is worrying.  why are you doing that?
[15:33:27] <jsharpminor> Well I can redact it to just $('#socialTabs').click(function () {
[15:33:32] <jsharpminor> and it doesnt work there either.
[15:33:50] <jsharpminor> But it works just fine on jsFiddle.
[15:34:06] <duch_kazatel> let me add some css to confirm.
[15:34:26] <tandroid> jsharpminor: could it be a conflict with another library?
[15:34:49] <jsharpminor> How would I go about diagnosing that?
[15:34:56] <jsharpminor> But we mostly just have jQuery and jQueryUI.
[15:35:01] <jsharpminor> And our own in-house functions.
[15:35:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/1/
[15:35:09] <tandroid> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[15:35:26] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor this content isn't getting ajaxed in, is it?
[15:35:35] <jsharpminor> No
[15:36:08] <jsharpminor> But I put the function in an included js file that might be loading before the page
[15:36:11] <tandroid> jsharpminor: are you using a cms like wordpress or drupal?
[15:36:17] <jsharpminor> tandroid: No.
[15:36:23] <duch_kazatel> also: inline onclick is bad. that should be avoided.
[15:36:31] <duch_kazatel> wrap your code in a document ready.
[15:38:55] <jsharpminor> duch: That did indeed solve the issue.
[15:39:21] <jsharpminor> So jQuery was trying to attach an event to a nonexistent object becuase the code was being executed before there were any objects to attach it to?
[15:39:46] <jsharpminor> So instead of attaching handlers to 4 items, it attached handlers to 0 items.
[15:39:53] <jsharpminor> Is that about right?
[15:40:02] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor correct. also, use event delegation and attach one listener instead.
[15:40:29] <jsharpminor> Event delegation - is that basically the opposite of inline onclick?
[15:40:33] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:40:44] <duch_kazatel> inline onclicks are the work of the devil and should never be used.
[15:41:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/2/
[15:44:27] <jsharpminor> Ahh, gotcha.
[15:44:34] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to migrate our code AWAY from inline onclicks.
[15:44:43] <jsharpminor> There's tons of them all throughout the site.
[15:45:14] <jsharpminor> So is $('#socialTabs').on('click', 'div', function () { creating only one handler whereas .children('div').click creates 4?
[15:47:44] <duch_kazatel> yes
[15:49:30] <jsharpminor> Thanks.
[15:51:00] <duch_kazatel> events "bubble up" through the document, so this captures when clicks hit #socialTabs and looks at the event target to figure out if they came from a div
[15:55:01] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/3/
[15:55:18] <ei2matrix> Hi guys! question, how can I set the default transition for my site in 1.4.x?
[15:55:48] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix 1.4.x what?
[15:55:52] <duch_kazatel> jquery mobile?
[15:55:59] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor what about it?
[15:55:59] <ei2matrix> yes sorry+
[15:56:21] <jsharpminor> How would you suggest fixing that? I want to do four different things; why wouldn't I use an inline onclick?
[15:56:43] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor because the html should be just markup and should not have your javascript embedded in it like that
[15:57:22] <jsharpminor> So I should assign them IDs and have a separate listener for each of them then?
[15:57:31] <duch_kazatel> nope.  i'll show you.
[15:58:00] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: yes jqm
[15:58:12] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix not really of much help there. sorry.
[15:58:40] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: thanks anyway :)
[15:59:24] <ei2matrix> somebody else? just set default transition for my hole site in jqm 1.4.x
[15:59:26] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix i'll point out that i found the answer in a quick google search.
[16:00:06] <ei2matrix> Yes, I was looking but the results doesn't worked for me
[16:00:19] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[16:01:20] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/6/
[16:01:25] <duch_kazatel> it would look something like this.
[16:02:33] <jsharpminor> That's stupidly simple. Why would I want to simplify when I can make maintainability so much harder? :-P
[16:02:46] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor hahahaha.
[16:02:48] <jsharpminor> Thanks, you're amazing.
[16:02:59] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix -> http://jsfiddle.net/RQ76s/1/ it'll be something like this i'll bet.
[16:03:11] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor it's nbd :)
[16:03:18] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: let me see
[16:05:29] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: I tried .on and .bind but not work. Always is fade by default and I want slide
[16:06:52] <duch_kazatel> ei2matrix and you put that before everything else, right?

[16:08:02] <duch_kazatel> this says what i posted should work.
[16:08:34] <duch_kazatel> you're using ajax, right?
[16:09:26] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: Oh! take a look: Because the mobileinit event is triggered immediately, you'll need to bind your event handler before jQuery Mobile is loaded. Link to your JavaScript files in the following order
[16:09:34] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[16:09:39] <duch_kazatel> the docs save the day again
[16:09:48] <ei2matrix> duch_kazatel: thanks man.a lot
[16:18:36] <dkphenom> im trying to hide part of the text in regular link. for instance if i have <a href="#">Read More <span class="arrow"></span></a> is there a way to hide just the Read More part of the link and not the span?
[16:19:14] <systemfault> dkphenom: No.
[16:19:31] <systemfault> dkphenom: Use another span to wrap the text.
[16:21:36] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you mean by "hide"
[16:21:44] <dkphenom> display:none
[16:21:58] <dkphenom> ?
[16:22:00] <duch_kazatel> does it have to be display none?
[16:22:06] <dkphenom> whats the alternative
[16:22:22] <dkphenom> im trying to hide the contents so that when the window is resized it's just an arrow
[16:22:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/94KSs/
[16:22:34] <dkphenom> but if it's resized back higher than lets say 768px i can just unhide
[16:22:48] <duch_kazatel> but normall you'd wrap each piece of text in a separate span.
[16:22:49] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[16:23:35] <__joshua__> if you are using window sizes for selective css use media queries
[16:23:42] <duch_kazatel> truth
[16:23:53] <duch_kazatel> that's also why my version uses css.
[16:24:04] <dkphenom> hmm, thanks duch, any way to get rid of that space?
[16:24:18] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:24:18] <dkphenom> or use .text()?
[16:24:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:24:31] <duch_kazatel> .text() won't accomplish what you want/
[16:24:39] <duch_kazatel> restructure your makup.
[16:24:43] <duch_kazatel> *markup
[16:25:03] <dkphenom> hmmm
[16:25:26] <dkphenom> but thats really the valid markup :/
[16:25:55] <duch_kazatel> hold up - nobody said your markup wasn't valid, but you can't do what you're looking to do without changing something.
[16:26:08] <duch_kazatel> the right way to do this is with media queries - that requires a small markup change.
[16:26:41] <dkphenom> well i mean i still would use media queries here...
[16:26:55] <dkphenom> can you show me what you mean?
[16:27:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/94KSs/1/
[16:27:46] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[16:28:54] <duch_kazatel> what is the arrow being used for?
[16:29:37] <dkphenom> part of the design, indicative that it's a link :/
[16:29:53] <duch_kazatel> the styling of the text should be indicative that it's a link imo.
[16:30:09] <ankurk_> So I am stuck, I want to merge two column texts in this table, http://jsbin.com/biziculu/1/edit
[16:30:11] <dkphenom> well the link is a button
[16:30:23] <dkphenom> so on smaller res, we getting rid of text and leaving an arrow
[16:30:27] <dkphenom> inside a button
[16:30:28] <ankurk_> The column name "Sales"
[16:30:48] <duch_kazatel> dkphenom then do that I did and add some extra css.
[16:30:49] <dkphenom> its not always the same text
[16:30:51] <duch_kazatel> *html
[16:30:55] <ankurk_> How would I do that?
[16:31:40] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ which columns?
[16:31:47] <ankurk_> though I have already merged the columns with same case #
[16:31:48] <dkphenom> @duch_kazatel, no jquery required?
[16:32:00] <duch_kazatel> dkphenom nope.  use media queries - they're apart of CSS.
[16:32:07] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: the Sales column,
[16:32:15] <duch_kazatel> also, prepending usernames with the @ symbol causes a lot of clients to not notify they were mentioned.
[16:32:21] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ merge it with what?
[16:32:26] <dkphenom> thanks @duch_kazatel
[16:32:32] <ankurk_> merge them together
[16:32:53] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ still not following.  merge them together... how?
[16:33:04] <ankurk_> Like there's a row with case #, '67770H', you can see that right?
[16:33:18] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:33:46] <ankurk_> I want to show the sales column like that, "Robert Peter, Stalin Simson"
[16:34:09] <ankurk_> and deleting the row containing 'Stalin Simson' after that
[16:34:19] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want to merge duplicate rows?
[16:34:25] <ankurk_> yes basically
[16:34:34] <duch_kazatel> don't do this on your frontend =/
[16:34:34] <ankurk_> I did most of the part
[16:34:38] <duch_kazatel> do it on your backend.
[16:34:40] <ankurk_> ahh
[16:34:47] <duch_kazatel> this is a terrible idea.
[16:34:51] <ankurk_> is it?
[16:34:54] <ankurk_> :(
[16:34:56] <duch_kazatel> in the frontend, yes.
[16:35:31] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ it's hard to know which ones to merge and which to not.
[16:35:53] <ankurk_> if you delete my part of the code, there are duplicate case #'s
[16:36:04] <ankurk_> so I want to merege those rows
[16:36:24] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/7/ <- If I make it into a function and hide it elsewhere in the JS, "this" doesn't seem to get passed and refers to the window instead.
[16:37:24] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor because you're losing context.  stop doing that.
[16:37:31] <duch_kazatel> use the delegation I showed your earlier.
[16:37:53] <jsharpminor> So remove the function and leave it in the document.ready ?
[16:38:02] <duch_kazatel> or do this: http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/8/
[16:38:36] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ yeah i'd still do this in your backend.
[16:39:31] <ankurk_> ahh okay will do it in the backend
[16:39:44] <ankurk_> thanks duch_kazatel, always a hero
[16:39:56] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ nah, just a glorified rubber duck.
[16:41:04] <duch_kazatel> my general rule is "if it seems way too hard, you're probably doing it wrong.
[16:41:09] <jsharpminor> duch_kazatel - I thought it was improper to omit the paren, don't I need one? compare
[16:41:14] <jsharpminor> .on('click', myFunction)
[16:41:15] <jsharpminor> .on('click', myFunction())
[16:41:40] <jsharpminor> But using it with the paren makes it fail
[16:41:42] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor not in this case. you're telling .on() the object to call.
[16:41:58] <duch_kazatel> .on() takes the name of the object, not the function.
[16:42:02] <ankurk_> hahaha
[16:42:09] <duch_kazatel> it adds the parens for you, basically.
[16:42:16] <jsharpminor> Okay.
[16:42:23] <jsharpminor> So an object is not a function.
[16:42:31] <duch_kazatel> but a function IS an object.
[16:42:53] <jsharpminor> the Venn diagram has function inside object.
[16:42:57] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:43:08] <jsharpminor> Okay.
[16:43:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/9/
[16:43:22] * jsharpminor 's mind is only kind of blown.
[16:43:25] <duch_kazatel> see the difference?
[16:43:48] <duch_kazatel> var socialTabFunction = function () {} is, in this case, equivalent to function socialTabFunction () {}
[16:43:54] <jsharpminor> and it would work either way?
[16:44:10] <duch_kazatel> in this case, yes.
[16:44:19] <duch_kazatel> scoping becomes pertinent
[16:44:49] <jsharpminor> Is there a reason you'd prefer one over the other? I'd think to prefer function socialTabFunction() by default just because it's a function declaration
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> i tend to use that, but it all depends.
[16:45:22] <jsharpminor> btw I'm trying to ask "learn this stuff" questions not "do it for me" questions, tell me if i'm on the right track.
[16:45:29] <duch_kazatel> good.
[16:45:34] <duch_kazatel> you're 100% on the right track :)
[16:45:41] <jsharpminor> thx
[16:45:47] <jsharpminor> and thx a million for all the help.
[16:45:48] <duch_kazatel> i give people a really hard time whey they ask me to do things for them.
[16:47:00] <__joshua__> jsharpminor the difference is hoisting

[16:47:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: How about a sammich
[16:47:32] <jsharpminor> hey i just wrote that
[16:47:32] <jsharpminor> function makeSandwich() {
[16:47:32] <jsharpminor>     bread();
[16:47:32] <jsharpminor>     mustard();
[16:47:32] <jsharpminor> }
[16:47:36] <duch_kazatel> :D
[16:48:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm trying to figure out wtf i'm making for dinner tonight.
[16:48:42] <BillCriswell> The type of mustard decides what I'll return on that sandwich.
[16:48:44] <duch_kazatel> i do all the cooking in my house.
[16:49:11] <BillCriswell> I had Wendy's.
[16:49:13] <duch_kazatel> well, 90% of it at least.  my wife cannot be trustred with basic things like mac and cheese.
[16:49:27] <Shadowz3n> $.makeSandwich = function(){ return bread+mustard+cheese+burguer+bread; };
[16:49:31] <Shadowz3n> :P
[16:49:33] <jsharpminor> duch_kazatel -- I'm not sure if I should even care about this, but why should "Movie's over!" not alert here http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/9/ ?
[16:50:03] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor when do you call it?
[16:50:09] <__joshua__> SeeAmovie never gets called?
[16:50:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah... my girlfriend could use a little help in the kitchen.
[16:50:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell can you cook?
[16:50:47] <BillCriswell> Nope. Interested in it, but pretty lazy.
[16:50:48] <duch_kazatel> because i am a fantastic cook myself and i kind of like it, so i'm all eh.
[16:51:04] <duch_kazatel> if you ever get serious, remember 2 key things:
[16:51:11] <BillCriswell> It's not immediate enough for me.
[16:51:38] <duch_kazatel> 1. Get a good chef's knife.  Wustof or Messermeister at least.
[16:51:44] <duch_kazatel> 2. Salt and fat = tasty.  always.
[16:51:52] <jsharpminor> Oh, I see why
[16:52:01] <BillCriswell> Haha
[16:52:03] <jsharpminor> function SeeAMovie isn't ever called. NEvermind.
[16:53:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I was like that for a while, and then i finally just sorta learned.  It's awesome.
[16:55:57] <duch_kazatel> cast iron skillet, good end-grain maple cutting board, and a good chef's knife are the three things you really need.
[16:56:57] <jsharpminor> And to think that there was a time when I wondered why burgers on the George Forman grill tasted like cardboard...
[16:57:47] <duch_kazatel> nah that's because people leave 'em on there too long.
[16:58:01] <duch_kazatel> if that were the case, grills in general would be awful.
[16:58:21] <jsharpminor> lol
[16:58:25] <jsharpminor> Shows you how well I cook then
[16:58:31] <duch_kazatel> :D
[16:58:48] <jsharpminor> I wouldn't starve to death.
[16:59:04] <jsharpminor> I'd just have to arrange a direct deposit to McDonalds.
[16:59:15] <duch_kazatel> i always have an easy time with big cuts of meat.  it's the smaller ones that need more finesse.
[16:59:38] <duch_kazatel> phrasing.
[16:59:39] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:01:59] <jsharpminor> duch_kazatel -- what part of the world do you hail from?
[17:02:08] <duch_kazatel> good ol' california.
[17:02:23] <duch_kazatel> from a magical land where the beer flows like water and something something
[17:02:49] <jsharpminor> air smells like warm root beer and the towels are oh so fluffy?
[17:02:59] <duch_kazatel> somebody is a weird al fan!
[17:03:02] <duch_kazatel> where are you from?
[17:03:07] <jsharpminor> central WA
[17:03:44] <duch_kazatel> i've got family up near seattle.
[17:05:21] <jsharpminor> CA... where the poverty line is $47,000 for a single adult, or $174,000 for a family of four, and between gas taxes and emissions inspections you lose about 2/3 of it.
[17:05:34] <duch_kazatel> nah, not nearly that bad.
[17:05:37] <jsharpminor> lol
[17:06:22] <duch_kazatel> i live in an area that's a little better overall.
[17:35:01] <jsharpminor> This just feels nasty, but is it legit?
[17:35:14] <jsharpminor> $('#elementOne').click($('#elementTwo').click());
[17:35:50] <beancurd> that looks nasty.
[17:36:13] <beancurd> why not just call whatever function elementtwo click fires directly?
[17:36:57] <jsharpminor> because elementtwo fires a contextual function dependent on "this" being what's clicked.
[17:38:40] <duch_kazatel> I'd do .trigger('click') personally, but generally doinmg something like that means you need to reconsider your overall approach.
[17:39:40] <jsharpminor> it's the same problem you helped me with, http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/9/ , but we're now expecting this button to be replicated elsewhere
[17:40:08] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to have the same button in multiple places?
[17:40:22] <jsharpminor> Basically... but it's not the same button.
[17:40:39] <duch_kazatel> because that means you need to change your approach :) why are you triggering a function on another button, but on click of a first button?  could you illustrate where you'd do that?
[17:41:27] <jsharpminor> A system of tabs. These buttons are the tabs. They go from being opened to being closed. The Tab1 Button2 is elsewhere on the page, but it causes Tab1 to pop up and display its content.
[17:41:57] <jsharpminor> So my approach is to tell it to just click Tab1.
[17:42:08] <duch_kazatel> okay - is button2 apart of the same container?
[17:42:16] <duch_kazatel> because you can also target classes for maximum effectiveness.
[17:42:50] <jsharpminor> No, of course not, that would be too easy. It's far away on the page.
[17:43:14] <duch_kazatel> you can also bind to multiple parent elements.
[17:44:07] <jsharpminor> They're separated by quite a bit of the DOM tree. How would that help?
[17:46:04] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what i mean.
[17:46:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/11/
[17:47:00] <duch_kazatel> trigger functions, don't synthetically trigger events.
[17:47:11] <duch_kazatel> pass around data when you can, too.
[17:54:21] * jsharpminor 's mind is officially blown.
[17:54:27] <jsharpminor> Where does it get the context for "this"?
[17:54:27] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:54:40] <duch_kazatel> oh, inside the function?
[17:54:52] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/N99fw/13/ shouldn't work but it does.
[17:54:55] <duch_kazatel> jquery makes $(this) wherever the event was triggered from.
[17:55:32] <jsharpminor> i think i'm onto something....
[17:55:34] <duch_kazatel> in the case of event bindings at least.
[17:55:39] <jsharpminor> i think i'm onto something....
[17:55:51] <jsharpminor> doubleposting ftw!
[17:56:01] <duch_kazatel> now, if you want two things to share the same state, don't have one update the other.
[17:56:08] <duch_kazatel> update data, and then update the two based on that data.
[17:58:58] <jsharpminor> okay, i think i'm with you so far.
[17:59:58] <jsharpminor> Give me a sec and I'll figure this one out... I think what I'm really after though is to get KnockKnock 1 to turn red, regardless of which of the two you press....
[17:59:58] * jsharpminor goes off to fiddle
[18:00:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you want an MV* of some sort.  if you're doing this for a bigger application, i'd really consider something like riot.js or backbone.
[18:01:59] <jsharpminor> MV* ?
[18:02:08] <duch_kazatel> Model, View, whatever.
[18:02:26] <duch_kazatel> like MVC but there's really no "controller".
[18:03:26] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go home.
[18:03:28] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[18:20:52] <tucan> hi, I have a responsive table using Bootstrap 3 and when viewing on small screens <360px width, the third column is sort of hidden from user, until he realizes that you can scroll sideways.

[20:00:54] <deeeed> hi
[20:16:28] <trewd6> how do I select children elements (input type text and selects) in a div?
[20:19:05] <BillCriswell> trewd6: $('div').find('input,select')
[20:19:28] <trewd6> BillCriswell: would this go deep into children of children?
[20:19:55] <BillCriswell> trewd6: It would.. if you didn't want to do that you'd use .children() instead of .find()
[20:20:19] <trewd6> BillCriswell: no that's what I want actually
[20:20:32] <trewd6> BillCriswell: input type text?
[20:21:00] <BillCriswell> That would get input type anything. If you just want type text ou'd need to use an attribute selector like input[type=text]
[20:22:10] <trewd6> BillCriswell: $("#div").find('input[type=text],select').each(function () { }
[20:22:20] <trewd6> how do I reference each element in the { } ?
[20:22:23] <BillCriswell> trewd6: That can work.
[20:22:32] <BillCriswell> trewd6: this
[20:22:48] <trewd6> this.removeClass("has-error"); is returning an error
[20:23:27] <trewd6> Object HTMLInputElement has no method removeClass
[20:24:30] <BillCriswell> trewd6: That's the dom node, you need to wrap it in jQuery to do that.
[20:24:37] <BillCriswell> so $(this).removeClass('has-error')
[20:24:53] <trewd6> $(this)?
[20:24:57] <trewd6> ah ok, thanks
[20:25:54] <disappearedng> Any recommendations for an alternative to dynatable? I love dynatable but it has so few documentations I don't want to spend days prototyping this
[20:28:25] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[20:30:05] <dismist> quick someone hold this niggas hand while he pissin
[20:32:33] <trewd6> thank you BillCriswell
[20:32:40] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[20:33:53] <dismist> dear god why wasnt u quicka to act when my lil g got wacked
[20:34:38] <dismist> and i know every dog have its day... but we fen to put it on for the lions
[20:35:44] <trewd6> BillCriswell: what's the difference between $("#ddlRegion") and $("ddlRegion") ?
[20:36:26] <BillCriswell> #ddlRegion selects the element with ddlRegion as the id.
[20:36:40] <BillCriswell> $('ddlRegion') gets <ddlRegion>
[20:39:22] <trewd6> BillCriswell: isn't it the same thing?
[20:39:42] <BillCriswell> trewd6: No.
[20:40:02] <BillCriswell> $("#ddlRegion") would select <element id="ddlRegion">
[20:40:12] <BillCriswell> $("ddlRegion") would select <ddlRegion>
[20:41:26] <trewd6> what do you mean by <ddlRegion>
[20:41:33] <trewd6> isn't that ultimately the element?
[20:42:31] <dismist> thats when that nigga turned to me, and said 'nigga you aint desertin me', i told that nigga im only in it to smash and dash and disappeared in a flash... two days pass im seein a rash.. better be that penicyllan kind or thats yo ass. u stuck wit me then nigga we f'in to have a blast.  these blisters bet not be that shit that last
[20:43:11] <BillCriswell> I mean those elements would be selected.
[20:44:48] <BillCriswell> trewd6: http://jsbin.com/yaselapi/1/edit?html,js,output
[20:45:42] <trewd6> ohh i see
[20:51:04] <mikeche1en> i am using popup image scaling from http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/popup-image-scaling/ is there any way to have it scale only once when loading, and not rescale after zoom?
[21:42:33] <ussher_> I have a few nested ul's and am wanting to target the li's for .click()  but if i use just $('li')  when i click on one of the lower level li's THIS is the top level li.  How do i target the click to be the deepest li that was clicked on?
[21:50:13] <jphase> ussher_: $('li').on('click', function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); // do click stuff here });
[21:50:18] <ussher_> Here is a jsFiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/6HUhw/
[21:50:43] <ussher_> thanks jphase, ill go try.

[22:34:19] <Uhkis> ageis: show your code in jsfiddle.net or equivalent

[22:38:57] <tw2113> ReferenceError: updateInterval is not defined
[22:39:29] <ageis> tw2113: it is defined
[22:39:38] <tw2113> not according to my browser console
[22:39:53] <ageis> wheres the error?
[22:40:02] <ageis> i mean, I see that, but the function is defined so whats wrong
[22:40:10] <tw2113> all i did was open firefox console and it just kept incrementing the same error
[22:40:12] <tw2113> 60 times
[22:42:06] <ageis> tw2113: the function is defined right there so whats the deal?
[22:42:12] <tw2113> i dunno
[22:42:17] <tw2113> i'm not THAT great with js
[22:42:19] <ageis> heh
[22:42:30] <tw2113> just reporting what i saw
[22:43:32] <tw2113> clicking on it lead to this
[22:43:33] <tw2113> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[22:44:53] <tw2113> but that's with me editing one thing
[22:45:13] <Cork> ageis: window.setInterval('updateInterval()', 1000);
[22:45:22] <Cork> never EVER EVER use strings for setTimeout
[22:45:28] <Cork> fix that and the error will go away
[22:45:48] <ageis> oh woops
[22:45:52] <tw2113> so window.setInterval(updateInterval(), 1000); ?
[22:45:57] <Cork> remove the ()
[22:46:20] <tw2113> window.setInterval(updateInterval, 1000);
[22:46:35] <Cork> ageis: if you give a string to those it will run an eval on the string
[22:46:39] <Cork> this happens in global scope
[22:46:47] <Cork> so you lose your current scope (onload)
[22:46:53] <Cork> so the functions isn't found
[22:47:12] <Cork> also you should most likely not use setInterval
[22:47:20] <Cork> it drifts
[22:47:47] <ageis> Cork: I still have a problem where this code is not working on jQuery 1.7.1 in Drupal
[22:47:48] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame might be a better choice
[22:50:39] <ageis> Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[22:51:53] <Cork> are you running your code in .ready?
[22:52:22] <ageis> no I'm not. im jsut reading about this now- what do I have to do for no-conflict ?
[22:54:00] <Cork> ageis: jQuery(function($) {}); would be the simplest
[22:54:11] <Cork> that would mean you have $ inside it
[22:54:21] <Cork> ageis: btw why do you need no-conflict in drupal?
[22:54:25] <Cork> it depends on jquery
[22:54:54] <ageis> I don't know. I have some other stuff here that only works on a specific jquery version (1.4 through 1.7) and im just trying to get this to be compatible
[22:55:22] <Cork> ageis: use the jquery-update plugin for drupal
[22:55:25] <ageis> Cork: I am
[22:55:33] <Cork> and you should be able to just get things working
[22:55:56] <Cork> it is normally a very bad idea to load multiple jquery versions on the same site
[22:56:07] <Cork> noConflict is for compatibility with other libs
[22:56:10] <Cork> not it self
[22:56:12] <ageis> yah
[22:56:17] <Cork> it works if you don't have plugins
[22:56:33] <Cork> but it becomes very fragile if you do
[22:56:53] <ageis> so I put my code within jQuery(function($) {  code here }); now it works, thanks
[22:57:18] <Cork> ageis: note you can use $ inside that function
[22:57:33] <Cork> you define $ to be jquery locally though the first argument
[22:59:17] <ageis> yeah
[23:51:20] <fattest>  how do i enable html tags? http://plnkr.co/edit/lbDsYVDbIuFpBIDDMpU2?p=preview
