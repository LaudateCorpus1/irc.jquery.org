[09:53:45] <sqpp> Hi
[09:53:47] <sqpp> I do have a HTML element with a simple jQuery script that basically shows the element upon hovering the menu. The issue is, when my mouse leaves the menu area, the element disappears. How could I fix that? A bit new to JS tbh :slight_smile:
[19:13:37] <robertparkerx> is it better to load jquery by CDN or local
