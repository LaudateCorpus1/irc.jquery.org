[01:15:05] <tnu0> Hi there. I'm quite a beginner. I want to do the following: "Check every 5 seconds through an ajax request that something is done, and when it's done, stop these ajax calls and display something."
[01:15:14] <tnu0> I don't know which pattern to use for this.
[01:19:04] <tnu0> Oh. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16437173/stop-jquery-setinterval
[01:35:10] <arthurvr> tnu0: did the SO question answer your question? It’s basically as easy as `setInterval()
[01:35:21] <arthurvr>  and then clearInterval() when you have to stop doing it
[01:35:31] <tnu0> Exactly. Thanks arthurvr
[03:41:14] <Mapos> Hey, would be anybody so helpful and explain me something ? :D
[03:52:30] <FlashySlash> Hey, would be anybody so helpful and explain me something ?
[03:56:56] <Oka> FlashySlash: If you have a question, just ask away. If someone can help, and has the time, they most likely will try to assist you.
[03:56:59] <monk3y> Sorry FlashySlash; the kinda way it runs here is that you don't ask if you can ask; you just ask.
[03:57:10] <monk3y> Heh d'oh, great minds.
[03:59:51] <FlashySlash> Oh sorry guys, so I've seen guys putting things into function() something like function(e) or so, what does the "e" stands for and what can it be used for?
[04:29:43] <monk3y> FlashySlash: sorry for the delay.  Here you go - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10323392/in-javascript-jquery-what-does-e-mean
[04:30:59] <monk3y> FlashySlash: and then - http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[04:33:58] <FlashySlash> thanks monk3y
[04:51:16] <Falbala> hello, I want to put a txt file into a variable as a whole string and then split it by " " and put it in an array. But I have only found examples where the data from a file is put into a div and I don't get them to work like I want it. Any suggestions?
[05:45:19] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I find an child-element, which has a special attribute set?
[05:51:15] <decx> depends on the attribute
[05:54:40] <JosefDe> decx: I only want to the the first child, which has an attribute set
[05:55:23] <decx> what part of depends on the attribute was unclear? ;)
[05:56:41] <FancyCamel> Hey there, not sure if this is a good place to ask... I'm having an issue with using $.ajax to call upon a php script to fetch from an API and then return the result back down into an array in the javascript. It appears the done() function is not executing at all as I'm not getting any of the console.log's. https://gist.github.com/JesseLeitch/db6e2b39e5db02e86639 The index file can be disregarded, as it was just me getting the fu
[05:56:59] <FancyCamel> I'm new to using ajax and such, haha
[05:57:11] <FancyCamel> If I should be asking elsewhere please let me know. :)
[05:58:11] <Uhkis> eww, lol api
[05:58:18] <FancyCamel> ;-;
[06:00:02] <Uhkis> that var dump is probably breaking it
[06:00:40] <JosefDe> Ok. Fixed it myself..
[06:04:47] <FancyCamel> Uhkis, removing the var dump did indeed make the .done execute. The console.log in the for loop isn't going off stuff but the other two were.
[06:51:17] <kokut> Hello, anyone here using jquery validate? i keep getting messages in the wrong language :\
[06:56:15] <kokut> nvm
[07:50:34] <SuperTyp> so I am building a mobile web page and in safari I get this error: [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.map, line 0)
[07:50:55] <SuperTyp> I don't have included this min.map file in any of my pages?!
[07:51:06] <SuperTyp> I don't even have it on my server
[07:56:32] <decx> a map file is for debugging
[07:57:10] <decx> maybe safari automatically tries to get it when you have devtools open?
[07:57:47] <Che-Anarch> any recommendations on well all round charting & graphing framework like Raphaël?
[07:57:54] <Bjerre> Hello people
[07:59:36] <Bjerre> If I have a great idea that can't be coded by myself, what would you do in your situation guys?
[08:00:37] <SuperTyp> decx: true
[08:01:15] <SuperTyp> I also get this message: Unexpected CSS token: : in structure-1.4.5.min.css:3
[08:42:28] <SuperTyp> I use FormData to send a file to my php script, when I do so nothing happens...
[08:43:06] <SuperTyp> http://pastie.org/10261758
[08:44:23] <SuperTyp> this works in IE, chrome, and FF but not in safari...please help!
[09:07:09] <SuperTyp> well it only doesnt work when file is too big
[09:17:10] <Bjerre> SuperTyp: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9951531/safari-converts-file-to-object-object-when-inserted-into-formdata-how-to-fix
[09:17:27] <Bjerre> is that what you have problems with?
[09:18:27] <Bjerre> Should be fixed now though on later versions
[09:22:20] <Hebron> is this valid: http://jsfiddle.net/mdxkyotg/2/
[09:22:24] <Hebron> why does the alert not go off?
[09:25:35] <arthurvr> Hebron: there are some things wrong with this snippet
[09:25:40] <arthurvr> first of all how you attached the event
[09:25:51] <arthurvr> jQuery objects don’t use `onclick`
[09:25:57] <arthurvr> instead use
[09:25:58] <arthurvr> !api on
[09:25:59] <b-ot> arthurvr: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:26:17] <arthurvr> Hebron: secondly, on jsfiddle there’s no add_sub.php
[09:26:40] <arthurvr> last of all your selector is a syntax error
[09:36:31] <Bjerre> wzup arthurvr
[09:36:47] <arthurvr> yoyo Bjerre
[09:41:17] <Hebron> arthurvr http://jsfiddle.net/mdxkyotg/3/
[09:41:30] <Hebron> I updated it to that
[09:41:37] <Hebron> and it's still not working
[09:41:39] <arthurvr> still the selector is wrong
[09:41:44] <Hebron> but I'm nto getting any error messages in my console either
[09:41:48] <Hebron> what does that mean?
[09:41:50] <Hebron> I'm a beginner
[09:42:05] <arthurvr> if you want to select an element by id you need a `#`
[09:42:22] <arthurvr> Hebron: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-item-using-class-or-id/
[09:42:25] <Hebron> oh that's selecting by class?
[09:42:35] <Hebron> gotcha! thanks
[09:42:49] <arthurvr> Hebron: selecting by class uses a period (.)
[09:42:57] <Hebron> yeah I saw in the link
[09:57:40] <chipyy_> Hey
[09:57:55] <arthurvr> yo chipyy_
[09:58:22] <arthurvr> Hebron: okay. FYI the learn.jquery.com is pretty cool if you’re new ;)
[09:58:28] <chipyy_> i have used slidebar from jquery library , i would like to add that if u enter number in input it will move slide
[09:58:42] <Hebron> I'll take a look!
[09:59:01] <chipyy_> this is my code: http://pastebin.com/4VmYHPmW
[09:59:12] <chipyy_> should i also paste html code?
[09:59:43] <chipyy_> + html http://pastebin.com/m5esRSVc
[10:03:53] <chipyy_> and what u thinking about using jquery? is it good thing? from my perspective i think its very usefull...
[10:04:29] <arthurvr> chipyy_: Oh yes it is :) If it wouldn’t be useful we wouldn’t all be here :p
[10:05:07] <chipyy_> jquery is built by community?
[10:06:17] <arthurvr> chipyy_: depends on your understanding of ”community”. It’s build by the jQuery team in their volunteer time and is totally open source.
[10:06:36] <chipyy_> that is how i understand community :D
[10:06:54] <arthurvr> chipyy_: then, yes it is!
[10:07:29] <chipyy_> ok, could u give me any advice about my slider?
[10:07:47] <arthurvr> chipyy_: not really. I don’t have experience with that plugin and not much time.
[10:07:56] <chipyy_> ok then ;)
[10:08:10] <arthurvr> sorry! but there are still 670 others in here.
[10:08:12] <arthurvr> :-)

[11:01:27] <SilverScythe> hello, I have a question on autofill for login forms
[11:01:41] <SilverScythe> in my site I would like to log my users out after a certain time being in active and bring them to the login page, but it is a real-time application so I am acutally using an iframe
[11:01:53] <SilverScythe> I have this working pretty well, but there is one unfortunate thing about the iframe
[11:02:03] <SilverScythe> on Chrome, the login forms don't autofill with one's login credentials when viewed through an iframe, but the autofill fine on FireFox
[11:02:54] <SilverScythe> is there any way I can make the forms autofill when viewed through an iframe?
[11:03:24] <SilverScythe> many users forget their passwords and rely on autofilling to login
[12:15:12] <satt> Anyone here today? I'm a newb having some errors retrieving json with ajax. Here's a gist.  https://gist.github.com/StoryStar/902c148627d2fc3e2fc8
[12:15:54] <rcyr> satt: What you get from that website doesn't look like json.
[12:16:27] <satt> yeah it's a string field in the json reponse
[12:16:33] <rcyr> Ahhh ok
[12:16:46] <satt> has newline characters that I think I've removed, but still getting an error
[12:17:45] <rcyr> satt: Perhaps the regex doesn't like the . characters
[12:17:50] <rcyr> Try to escape them
[12:17:54] <rcyr> \. instead of .
[12:19:49] <rcyr> satt: Got it? str.replace(/www\.snapstars\.net/g,"") instead of str.replace(/www.snapstars.net/g,"")
[12:20:43] <satt> rcyr - thanks - I think that's actually removed already - the cleaned string is at the end of the error message.  I'll give it a shot though
[12:20:54] <Uhkis> on another note: $(data.video.width)[0] is the same as data.video.width
[12:22:34] <Uhkis> and why on earth are you trying to use that mess as a jquery selector? that's probably your error itself
[12:24:02] <Uhkis> you're doing: $('Name: dillon francis,snapchat username: dillonfrancis,tag: celebrity,tag: funnycelebrity');
[12:24:09] <Uhkis> makes no sense what so ever
[12:24:17] <satt> Uhkis - thanks.  haha I inherited this code from an eng who couldn't figure it out, just picked it up today.  I'm usually an android/ios dev.  How should I go about it?
[12:24:44] <satt> rcyr - escaping the . didn't fix it, thanks though
[12:25:01] <Uhkis> you probably just want description = cleanJson(data.video.description);
[12:25:52] <satt> Uhkis - Thanks! I think it's fixed!
[12:26:07] <satt> Just gonna see if i can get it to work
[12:27:10] <Uhkis> satt: i'm pretty sure none of those variables need jquery at all
[12:28:11] <satt> Uhkis: You're probably right, I certainly don't really know what I'm doing :)
[12:30:31] <Uhkis> sounds scary
[12:30:46] <Uhkis> "inherited this code from an eng who couldn't figure it out" "I certainly don't really know what I'm doing" :D
[12:38:54] <satt> Uhkis - it is definitely a little scary.  Thanks again for your help.  Here's the full working version, maybe you can tell me if I'm doing anything else silly
[12:38:56] <satt> https://gist.github.com/StoryStar/d72feb4f018f3e85ddd3
[12:39:39] <satt> besides my unneccesaryy logging
[12:50:59] <monk3y> Anyone know any good jQuery (or otherwise) visual 'rule' editors?  As in something that allows users to compose business/logic rules visually, like 'value = true if [setting1 AND setting2 OR setting3].
[14:01:32] <Lencl> for jquery mobile, when I have a link to go to my other page, it kind of fades away and goes into it
[14:01:56] <Lencl> so it doesn't reload the page.. that is fine, but is there a way I could detect that event?
[14:02:29] <Lencl> actually nvm
[14:06:10] <glowdemon1> on('onmouseover') does this still work?
[14:06:14] <glowdemon1> or are there better ways to do it?
[14:06:21] <rcyr> It never worked.
[14:06:34] <glowdemon1> noticed
[14:06:37] <glowdemon1> hover?
[14:07:08] <rcyr> .hover is a combination of the mouseenter and mouseleave events, It might be what you're looking for.
[14:07:14] <Oka> .on('mouseenter')
[14:09:16] <peterR``> how to do autocomplete with an ID but without showing the ID in the input box?
[14:18:57] <SuperTyp> peterR``: clearify
[14:18:59] <SuperTyp> please
[14:22:38] <peterR``> SuperTyp, I make an array containing UK railways stations and station codes
[14:23:06] <peterR``> I want to autocomplete on the station names, but I want to be able to get the code of the station in JS to send to a server
[14:23:34] <peterR``> so I always need the code of the station, but I never want to actually see it in the page
[14:26:58] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/3bDZWDJLQWzew5EwUVDzSpq this behaves really spastic, any better way to do this?
[14:34:42] <Razerglass> hey guys im trying to target all href inside one of my DIVs, is something like this accurate? $('#div a[href^="/maps/"]')
[14:35:35] <Razerglass> all href that start with /maps/*
[14:40:56] <acidjazz> RAZERGLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[14:41:32] <Razerglass> acccccid whatsup buddy I got it figured out needed to throw a .each function in there :)
[14:50:29] <Razerglass> hm now i am having another issue, with my links its appending them onto the domain, so for testing they opening up like this "localhost:3333/www.gooogle.com/xxxx.... "   "Cannot GET /www" how do I make these links go to their destination and not append onto my uri structure?
[14:56:37] <SuperTyp> peterR``: input type="hidden"...?
[14:57:31] <Lencl> This is a weird issue: http://76.79.253.139/~midev1/miwebsite/index.php?id=18#page2
[14:57:37] <SuperTyp> Razerglass: show us what you are doing so maybe we can help ypu
[14:57:54] <Lencl> Click on settings... then when you choose one of the checkboxes in the settings menu, it closes the popup :\
[14:59:04] <SuperTyp> Lencl: what checkboxes?
[14:59:34] <Lencl> "Use Homepage layout" and "New Layout"
[15:00:12] <SuperTyp> ah sorry I'm dumb
[15:01:05] <Lencl> it's using jquery mobile
[15:01:30] <Razerglass> got it! just needed to add http:// in front of the links :D
[15:09:38] <SuperTyp> Lencl: maybe its because of the jquery Mobile submit that happens there? You can clearly see that some event is triggered
[15:09:59] <SuperTyp> do you use the default .popup()?
[15:13:39] <Lencl> what do you mean by default .popup()
[15:13:53] <Lencl> I do use $("#id').popup('open')
[15:19:44] <SuperTyp> yes thats what I wanted to know =)
[15:19:54] <SuperTyp> (maybe its a external plugin)
[15:26:57] <SuperTyp> Lencl: I looked at you code, I cant find the reason why its happening
[15:28:08] <SuperTyp> Lencl: but why is the focus always one the "My Website" input?
[15:37:04] <Lencl> SuperTyp, that's a huge question I've been wanting to know the answer to
[15:42:41] <Lencl> I downgraded to 1.4.4 jquery mobile and it fixed the focus issue :)
[17:37:53] <Dancia> I have written a piece of code http://jsfiddle.net/s2arvdck/5/ which creates combinations from three select boxes. I want to be able to past these combination to PHP, also to be able to remove some combinations from the list. Any suggestions how to improve this code? Maybe putting combinations somehow into hidden input?
[19:56:08] <Zephree> Hi All, I'm having a small spot of trouble, I am using $("#divID").css("display", "none"); - which is hiding what I want, but then it just leaves a blank spot. If I resize my window at all the white space is consumed. Is there some kind of update or re-draw I can force?
[22:55:16] <fattest> in my css, i have input.tagit-hidden-field {     display: none; }; how do i select this with jquery?
[23:25:10] <tcpman> Grrr
