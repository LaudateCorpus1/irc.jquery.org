[01:25:31] <granden> If I got two dropdowns, one for week number, and one for year. And when either is changed I want to run a ajax call to check if any of the dates in that week is a holiday/red day. So thought I would return an array of numbers, 1-7 for day index. And then highlight those days in the list.
[01:25:52] <granden> But my question is, how should I bind this ajax call, performance wise.
[01:26:17] <granden> For starters week and year is non selected in the dropboxes so first time both have to be set as well.
[01:26:36] <granden> but maybe just ignore that case and return an 0 in the ajax call and handle it that way?
[01:36:35] <hesperaux> When I use JQueryUI's tabs and the tab content is ajax-loaded, any jquery calls i have prepared for the loaded content do not work. I am guessing that this is because the jquery functions for the loaded content are executed *before* the content is loaded into the tab. Is this correct? If so, how can I fix this problem?
[01:48:29] <gvo> hesperaux: You can move the calls to the success function of the ajax call.
[01:48:58] <hesperaux> gvo, that would be an immense callback. absolutely huge. For now, i've solved the problem by placing the script tag in the content.
[01:49:09] <hesperaux> I wanted to avoid this as script tags not in the <head> can cause some issues
[01:49:52] <gvo> hesperaux: I'm not aware of any other solution, offhand.
[01:50:04] <hesperaux> This works ok
[01:50:11] <hesperaux> i'll just go with this
[01:50:41] <fat> Hello. My JTICKER's "NEXT" button isn't working. http://jsfiddle.net/Q6E2c/2/. JTICKER site http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/870/simple-jQuery-Typing-Text-Effect
[01:51:16] <gvo> hesperaux: The only reason I'd go with my suggestion is to front load the loading of the JS.
[01:51:35] <hesperaux> yeah I see what you mean
[01:51:49] <fat> can any1 help/.
[01:52:06] <hesperaux> the problem is that there's about 20 jquery functions, including ajax functions, that are initialized to elements within the tab content
[01:52:24] <gvo> On a slow connection, loading the content at a later time might give the user a sense of a slow app.
[01:52:38] <gvo> hesperaux: So what?  It's gonna get there eventually.
[01:53:17] <fat> pls help
[01:53:21] <gvo> hesperaux: The code is going to have to get loaded into the browser eventually anyhow.
[01:53:38] <hesperaux> right
[01:53:59] <entrada> fat: jquery 1.9.x doesn't use the live method
[01:54:01] <hesperaux> so are you suggesting i do away with the use of load() on the UI tabs and just put the content all into one page?
[01:54:07] <entrada> fat:  use on() or click() instead
[01:54:09] <gvo> If it's an organizational issue, break it up into multiple loads/files.
[01:54:29] <fat> entrada: i have no idea what that means. how do i use it on my fiddle?
[01:54:33] <hesperaux> and by that i meant, into different elements that become part of the tabs
[01:54:39] <gvo> hesperaux: No not necessarily.
[01:54:59] <entrada> fat: if you have no idea what something means, you should research, read & learn about it.
[01:55:22] <fat> entrada: i am trying to learn. thats why im at irc
[01:55:34] <gvo> Just move the "any jquery calls i have prepared for the loaded conten" to the success fuction of the ajax call.
[01:56:01] <gvo> You can still load the content when necessary, but don't try to operate on it until it's there.
[01:56:20] <entrada> ? live @ fat
[01:56:23] <gvo> entrada: we're the research.  ;)
[01:56:25] <hesperaux> gvo, i'm not sure how to do that with JqueryUI's tabs.
[01:56:32] <fat> entrada: help pls
[01:56:46] <gvo> OK so you're not doing the ajax call yourself?
[01:56:47] <entrada> jquery bot commands don't seem to work. hmm
[01:57:05] <entrada> fat go read documentation for live()
[01:57:14] <entrada> and figure out how to replace it with on()
[01:57:18] <entrada> or click()
[01:57:18] <hesperaux> gvo, correct. It is built-in to the JQUI tabs as a feature, of sorts
[01:57:21] <hesperaux> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax
[01:58:40] <gvo> hesperaux: Use one of the events.  Look at activate for instance.
[01:59:32] <gvo> hesperaux: or load looks more likely to do what you want.
[02:00:50] <arex\\> Do you guys have any good examples of validating certain combinations of choices in a form?
[02:01:41] <arex\\> "you can only choose this one if you've chosen that one" etc
[02:01:43] <entrada> arex\\: jquery.validation can let you write custom validators, if that's what you're looking for
[02:02:25] <arex\\> entrada: probably. that's the plugin im using. was just hoping to find some examples
[02:02:41] <entrada> arex\\: you might want to go through the docs
[02:04:03] <fat> entrada: what do i do with the function ()click. please help
[02:04:22] <entrada> ?click @ fat
[02:04:35] <entrada> ? click @ fat
[02:04:39] <fat> entrada: you said jquery 1.9.1 doens't do live action
[02:04:48] <entrada> yep
[02:04:52] <gvo> entrada: bot is sleeping.
[02:04:52] <fat> entrada: it works on 1.8.3
[02:05:01] <entrada> ah thanks, @gvo
[02:05:07] <entrada> yes, fat, it does
[02:05:09] <gvo> entrada: Just a guess
[02:05:13] <fat> entrada: how do i fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/Q6E2c/4/
[02:05:38] <entrada> fat, replace live with either click or on. if you don't know how to, go read their documentation
[02:06:16] <fat> entrada: i can't find "live"
[02:06:20] <fat> entrada: on the javascript
[02:06:22] <hesperaux> derp
[02:06:27] <hesperaux> read docs on click()
[02:06:55] <entrada> fat: yeah? what about line 43? does it say live?
[02:07:17] <fat> entrada: my firefox search didn't search that soz
[02:08:13] <fat> entrada: its not working if i put click or on
[02:08:36] <fat> entrada:     jQuery(".next").on("click", function(){
[02:08:43] <entrada> fat: the syntax for live and click are slightly different. go read.
[02:08:51] <entrada> fat: the same with live and on.
[02:09:04] <fat> entrada: what is it
[02:09:12] <hesperaux> lol
[02:09:21] <entrada> man, this derp.
[02:09:33] <klotho> what do you guys think of backbone.js?
[02:09:53] <fat> aw ur a bully
[02:10:45] <entrada> fat: aww you're just begging on irc.
[02:11:03] <hesperaux> lol
[02:11:06] <fat> ok ill read the docs now
[02:11:15] <entrada> klotho: i use it all the time, is there a specific question you'd like answered?
[02:11:17] <hesperaux> xD
[02:11:20] <entrada> :D
[02:12:56] <klotho> Entomo : I haven't developed with javascript jquery or jquery mobile before and am trying to figure out the easiest way to do a phonegap app. would you recommend using backbone?
[02:13:03] <klotho> I mean entrada
[02:13:03] <coldhead> great work everyone
[02:13:38] <entrada> klotho: no. i think you should start using jquery mobile first, for the phonegap app
[02:13:54] <coldhead> it depends how complicated the app is
[02:14:15] <entrada> klotho: i wouldn't suggest using backbone, considering you're new to writing js/jq/jqm
[02:15:13] <klotho> ok, thanks... I was thinking of it because I already have all kinds of events and callbacks going on and I have only written like 1% of it
[02:15:56] <klotho> another issue is that it looks really slow: the screen will paint, and then things will reposition after. Is there a way to not show anything until it's all in its final positions and sizes etc?
[02:16:47] <entrada> klotho: sure, hide the parent container, paint everything inside, then show the container
[02:17:43] <klotho> what's the earliest I can hide it though? When I tried hiding in the on pageinit event it didn't seem to work
[02:17:53] <klotho> and after that, the page is already visible
[02:18:54] <entrada> klotho: how about in the HTML? add a class called hidden, and remove it when you're ready with everything
[02:19:10] <entrada> klotho: .hidden { display: none; }
[02:20:19] <klotho> I think you suggested that, but where would that go? in the data-role="page" div? the issue there though is that I have some code which calculates the page size by the size of the different elements and I wonder if it would work if the page was hidden?
[02:21:02] <entrada> klotho: it won't. try a .hidden { visibility: hidden; } instead
[02:21:02] <gvo> he could always use the hidden class initally then use .show() and .hide() to toggle.
[02:21:32] <klotho> how would that work gvo?
[02:22:33] <gvo> Do as entrada says, then when you are ready use the .show() call
[02:22:54] <gvo> ready to display it, use the .show() call
[02:22:56] <klotho> so create a css file with a .hidden definition or something?
[02:23:39] <gvo> And add that class entrada gave you to the div  around the hidden elements.
[02:24:37] <gvo> klotho: do remember that visibility:hidden elements still take up space on the page.
[02:24:39] <klotho> like <div class=".hidden {visibility: hidden;}" >
[02:24:47] <gvo> No
[02:25:04] <gvo> <div id="hidden">
[02:25:35] <gvo> and an entry into a .css file like .hidden { visibility: hidden; }
[02:26:09] <klotho> so a div around the other divs? before the <div id="index" data-role="page" data-theme="a"> for example?
[02:26:14] <gvo> sorry <div class="hidden">
[02:26:28] <gvo> I'm not away, sorry.
[02:26:29] <klotho> oh or just add class="hidden" to that div
[02:26:31] <gvo> awake
[02:26:37] <gvo> Yes
[02:30:29] <gvo> klotho: an element can belong to multiple classes
[02:31:20] <klotho> hmm... now I need to figure out how to show it without hard coding every page
[02:34:41] <klotho> how would I address the div with data-role="page"?
[02:35:13] <klotho> $('[data-role="page"]')?
[02:36:15] <klotho> nope
[02:36:21] <klotho> that showed both pages at once!
[02:36:44] <klotho> and the page wasn't hidden either
[02:36:46] <klotho> :(
[03:18:52] <gvo> klotho: staill there
[03:18:57] <gvo> still
[03:19:46] <klotho> hi gvo
[03:20:24] <gvo> klotho: had to run out for a bit.  You'll need to add a unique id= to each div.
[03:20:45] <klotho> I have a unique id on each div
[03:20:51] <gvo> That's the simpliest way to address individual elements, otherwise you'll have to walk the doc tree,
[03:20:58] <klotho> but I'd like to do the same thing for each one in the pageload event
[03:21:13] <klotho> so that the current div with data-role=page is shown
[03:21:23] <klotho> rather than hard coding each page's unique id
[03:21:31] <gvo> OK so for which ever  page you want to display do a $("#xxx").show();
[03:22:31] <gvo> If both showed up then both have that "data-role"
[03:22:55] <gvo> What browser are you using?
[03:23:16] <klotho> webkit
[03:23:33] <gvo> That's a browser?
[03:23:36] <klotho> yes, I have multiple pages in one file... jquery mobile
[03:23:44] <klotho> android and iphone browsers
[03:24:22] <gvo> You're doing development on a phone?  Wow!
[03:24:34] <klotho> trying
[03:25:01] <gvo> I'd suggest you invest in a computer and run chrome or FF so you have reasonable debugging capabilities.
[03:25:13] <klotho> heh, no I have a computer
[03:25:24] <klotho> but I'm doing phonegap dev
[03:25:44] <gvo> Will this page display in chrome?
[03:26:08] <klotho> one of them will probably
[03:26:13] <klotho> but I'd have to cut it up
[03:27:08] <gvo> OK whatever.  Anyway I suspect you have both "pages" defined with the data-role=page, but debugging something like that from a phone isn't something I'd tackle.
[03:28:29] <klotho> yeah I do
[03:28:53] <gvo> and that's why the both appear.
[03:29:14] <klotho> right
[03:31:47] <klotho> ok... sleep time
[03:31:48] <klotho> ttyl!
[03:32:07] <gvo> byw
[03:32:10] <gvo> bye

[04:17:42] <gvo> ikb: what causes it to become hidden?
[04:18:50] <iKb> gvo, a select field Yes/No
[04:19:37] <gvo> You are doing a .hide() from some other event?
[04:22:51] <entrada> iKb: trigger a element:hidden event when you hide it, listen for it somewhere else.

[08:26:39] <Aero`> Hi guys ! I'm in a bit of a trouble with sendinx data with $.ajax() ! My problem is that I'd like to send BOTH an array of ID's and form serialized data. No luck with pushing id's into the serialized data array, or merging both arrays, so far... Any idea ? Thanks in advance for your help !
[08:28:32] <NoWired> Aero`, do you try with something like var params = { serialized: serialized-data; ids: ids-data }
[08:31:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm at a loss here
[08:31:44] <iSeeDeadPixels> i tried to do it myself, i searched google, tried multiple plugins, but i can't find an easy way to do it
[08:36:15] <iSeeDeadPixels> i have a menu on the bottom, and i want to slide the div that's in the center of the page (content) offscreen and slide the next div into the viewport
[08:37:49] <Aero`> @NoWired : actually this sends two fields, serialized, and multiple fields for my array of ID's. What I'd like to do is to keep the standard format when you send data : $("#form").serialize() and to add multiple fields like IdsArray[]
[08:38:04] <Aero`> if you see what I mean
[08:38:09] <Aero`> sorry for my bad english
[08:40:44] <Aero`> You know I think I have some solution to this problem but I can't have a correct syntax for it
[08:41:26] <Aero`> I would have my selectedIds array, and then push each key=>value of the $("#form") array into the first array
[08:41:46] <Aero`> and send it serialized with serializeArray()
[08:46:28] <Aero`> you know, something using each() and .push()

[09:00:17] <FernandoBasso> CodingBean: I mostly used $.post. Why don't you ask you actual question and maybe someone will be able to help.
[09:00:27] <FernandoBasso> s:you:your:
[09:02:18] <CodingBean> OK... I have a REST API service running off of Node on random.jit.su, and I want to make  jQuery example, but whenever I try to connect it gives me a CROSS_DOMAIN_ERROR. Please see http://random.codingbean.com.
[09:02:31] <CodingBean> @FernandoBasso ^
[09:02:57] <FernandoBasso> Doesn't it categorize as cross scripting?
[09:03:17] <FernandoBasso> I believe browsers disallow that kinkd of stuff, but I'm not sure.
[09:04:05] <Mkop> jsonp might be a solution
[09:04:21] <CodingBean> But I have seen examples of it working with other sites such as http://jsfiddle.net/ZfvKm/2/.
[09:04:58] <Dreamer3> CodingBean:  you have to set certain headers
[09:05:01] <FernandoBasso> CodingBean: Then I _am_ indeed wrong.
[09:05:03] <Dreamer3> CodingBean: on the REMOTE server
[09:05:06] <Dreamer3> to allow is
[09:05:08] <Dreamer3> *it
[09:05:33] <Dreamer3> google cross site scripting allow headers or something
[09:05:40] <CodingBean> How can I do that in Node (I know how to do so in PHP).
[09:06:03] <CodingBean> Like http://code.google.com/p/xssf/?

[09:28:22] <NeedSomeHelp> <select id='role_id'><option value='1'>Role 1</option><option value='2'>Role 2</option>, how do I remove option 2 ?
[09:33:08] <gordian> NeedSomeHelp: you just need to use the "delete" or "backspace" key on your keyboard
[09:33:34] <gordian> either one should work nicely
[09:33:55] <NeedSomeHelp> funny
[09:36:04] <gordian> you asked how to remove something
[09:36:30] <gordian> if you plan to use jQuery somehow then you may want to be more specific with your questions or post a jsfiddle
[09:36:42] <obert> ajax is widely used?
[09:36:43] <gordian> i'm not going to guess at what you meant
[09:37:53] <NeedSomeHelp> yes, using jquery
[09:39:04] <gordian> NeedSomeHelp: congratulations, you just irritated the only person trying to help you
[09:39:21] <mg983> Hey guys… is there any way to have the main vertical scrollbar act like jQuery UI Snap To Increments (http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/steps.html) — on a single page architecture site like http://coffee.matgargano.com ?
[09:39:23] <NeedSomeHelp> 1 min, Ill post a jsfiddle
[09:43:20] <NeedSomeHelp> gordian: look for the help comment lines here http://jsfiddle.net/B7ygz/4/
[09:44:16] <NeedSomeHelp> no, here http://jsfiddle.net/B7ygz/6/
[09:46:25] <ajpiano> NeedSomeHelp: .val() returns a string with the value
[09:46:28] <ajpiano> it doesn't return an elemnt
[09:46:38] <ajpiano> i think you are looking for $("#patternset_id option:selected").remove()
[09:49:18] <NeedSomeHelp> ajpiano: thanks, that worked. Now how do I put it back to the listbox when removed from the list? (check the 2nd commentary)
[10:06:11] <Aero`> Hi guys :) Anyone would have time to look for a problem in an AJAX request ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14800269/sending-both-form-serialized-data-and-an-array-of-ids-through-ajax Thanks !
[10:16:45] <tlkr> Aero`, create an object with a nested object and serialize that.
[10:19:30] <Aero`> @tlkr : Could you be more specific ? You mean like doing data : {selectedIds : selectedIds,{serializeddata : serializeddata}} ?
[10:20:33] <tlkr> I'm just writing an example
[10:22:25] <Aero`> Thanks :)
[10:24:36] <zafu> hi, why does this not work as expected ?  $('#image_container').replaceWith($(rtext).filter('#image_container'));
[10:25:03] <zafu> rtext is a full web page
[10:29:09] <Aero`> @tlkr : I need to leave quickly but could you post your example on stackoverflow ?
[10:29:11] <Aero`> thanks !
[10:38:56] <zafu> filter(elem) doesn't seem to work on a full html page, known issue?
[10:39:04] <zafu> whereas find(eleme) does work
[10:46:48] <jrajav> zafu: Construct a working example demonstrating your problem or confusion in jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[10:47:20] <chanhannigan> hey, steal some advice?
[10:48:06] <chanhannigan> jquery mobile, need to load a large chunk of JSON after the index.html is finished loading
[10:52:47] <zafu> jrajav: can I test jq expressions in firebug?
[10:52:54] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, how do I grab the value inside the span ("WTF" here) ? http://jsfiddle.net/B7ygz/8/
[10:53:16] <jrajav> zafu: If jQuery has been included on the current page, yeah
[10:53:26] <jrajav> zafu: If not you'll have to include it first (but you can do that from the console)
[10:53:36] <jrajav> Just grab it from one of 50 CDNs that have it
[10:54:07] <zafu> jrajav: ok, so now how do I include the full current page in my selector: $(current_page) ?
[10:55:34] <jrajav> NeedSomeHelp: By selecting it and then using a method like .text() or .html() : Choose hairstyles, jewelry, and clothing; invent a new dance
[10:55:44] <jrajav> Oh psh haha wrong paste
[10:55:47] <jrajav> http://jsfiddle.net/B7ygz/9/
[10:56:03] <jrajav> (Don't ask.)
[10:56:25] <zafu> so in firebug if I go $('html').filter('#image_container') I get no match
[10:56:33] <zafu> but with find I have a match
[10:57:58] <jrajav> zafu: You should use 'document' instead, but the main problem is that you're misunderstanding the .filter() method. It doesn't filter the selected objects PLUS DESCENDANTS, it just filters the objects you've selected
[10:58:10] <jrajav> zafu: And in this case you've only selected the single object 'html' or 'document'
[10:58:45] <NeedSomeHelp> jrajav: thanks, but that doesnt really work. There are in reality many <li>'s, not just one, and their id's are dynamically generated, so I cant reference them by its id
[10:58:50] <zafu> jrajav: ok thanks
[10:59:07] <jrajav> NeedSomeHelp: Well you need some way to get the specific span you're interested in
[10:59:46] <NeedSomeHelp> yes i need that
[11:00:45] <NeedSomeHelp> http://jsfiddle.net/B7ygz/10/
[11:00:47] <relipse> i have a website and for some reason the jqueryui dialog is opening at a height 100px smaller than it should be, if i run the same code in the chrome console, it works fine $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250});
[11:01:11] <jrajav> NeedSomeHelp: .. Yes you do.
[11:01:30] <jrajav> NeedSomeHelp: If you say that the li's id can't be used, then what do you expect? Perhaps you need to change that.
[11:01:42] <NeedSomeHelp> jrajav: did you see my last jsfiddle? should explain it better
[11:01:52] <jrajav> NeedSomeHelp: Unless you just need all of those span's text and don't care which ones
[11:01:57] <jrajav> Yes, I saw it
[11:02:20] <jrajav> But since you haven't given the span's themselves id's, the only way to identify a specific one is with the parent li's id
[11:02:22] <NeedSomeHelp> the id has to be used, but not by hardcoding
[11:02:33] <jrajav> Well then get it from wherever you need to get it
[11:02:49] <jrajav> You can construct a selector string with a variable
[11:03:00] <jrajav> $('li#' + li_id)
[11:07:55] <NeedSomeHelp> thanks. Almost there (I hope)
[11:11:14] <relipse> can someone please answer my question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14801517/jqueryui-dialog-not-opening-with-correct-height
[11:16:00] <tlkr> relipse, I see this on button: <a onclick="$('#dlgAddWorkLog').dialog('open'); return false;" href="#">
[11:16:05] <grafi> yeah
[11:16:08] <grafi> exactly
[11:17:00] <relipse> tlkr: so?
[11:17:14] <relipse> that just opens the dialog
[11:17:19] <relipse> the first initiates it
[11:18:57] <Foxhoundz> relipse: separate content from logic
[11:19:53] <relipse> i'm not really looking to spend the next 3 hours doing that
[11:21:14] <chris___> I'm using Jquery mobile but on an Android device the transitions are strange : before the transition happens the screen blinks a couple of times.  is there a way around this?
[11:34:20] <jasonthesensei>  I'm trying to gather all of the classNames on a particular html  page but i need to exclude the classNames that are applied via modernizr any idea on how to exclude the classNames attachted to <html class="no-js> or whatever classes modernizr adds
[11:34:23] <b-ot> jasonthesensei: No output.
[11:40:25] <ddsss> $(document).on('click.button.data-api', '[data-toggle^=button]', function (e) {
[11:40:26] <ddsss>  ^what is the even this click handler being attached to? I understan click - but what is click.button.data-api?
[11:40:44] <ddsss> ^this is from jquery bootstrap button: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-button.js
[11:42:00] <systemfault> It's the second form of .on
[11:42:55] <systemfault> The handler is attached to the document, the event seems to be a custom one… and it works for all [data-toggle^=button]
[11:46:47] <ddsss> systemfault, i guess I don't understand fully how would it get triggered when I simply click on a button....
[11:47:16] <systemfault> ddsss: Do you understand "bubbling"?
[11:47:24] <ddsss> systemfault, yes
[11:47:31] <systemfault> That's how it works..
[11:49:52] <thowe> I have a form template that I use to insert forms into certain page elements if they expand.  I can't seem to figure out how to make their submit buttons be attached to a pre-defined function (that does an ajax call, but that's probably not relevant).
[11:50:46] <thowe> I thought I was supposed to use "live", but it sees the template on load and calls the function, but doesn't on submit of the generated forms.
[11:51:00] <thowe> maybe there is an example or doc somewhere?
[11:51:21] <ddsss> systemfault, no - I realize that it's  a delegated event that handled at the document level.:) I 'm confused how clicking on a button which I assume is a  click event translates into click.button.data-api event?
[11:51:27] <tw2113> .live got depreciated and i think maybe removed thowe
[11:51:38] <tw2113> as of 1.9
[11:51:51] <thowe> hrm.  I think I am 1.7.2
[11:51:54] <systemfault> tw2113: Yeah.. .live is now dead
[11:52:34] <thowe> OK, so how do I define a function that is attached to the submit event of forms that don'
[11:52:49] <thowe> that will be created
[11:52:51] <djQuery> ?eval .01+.02
[11:52:55] <bot-t> djQuery: 0.03
[11:53:27] <djQuery> ?eval .1+.2
[11:53:28] <bot-t> djQuery: 0.30000000000000004
[11:53:58] <djQuery> anyone have  a plugin that will round that to .3
[11:54:10] <grafi> oô^
[11:54:24] <systemfault> djQuery: .3 doesn't exists ;)
[11:54:50] <jasonthesensei>  I'm trying to gather all of the classNames on a particular html  page but i need to exclude the classNames that are applied via modernizr any idea on how to exclude the classNames attachted to <html class="no-js> or whatever classes modernizr adds
[11:54:53] <b-ot> jasonthesensei: No output.
[11:55:39] <systemfault> jasonthesensei: I think you can configure the modernizr builder to add a prefix to modernizr classes
[11:56:14] <thowe> Nobody knows?  This must really be a weird thing then?
[11:58:24] <djQuery> thowe, so the form is not created yet?
[11:58:36] <thowe> And many of them may be created.
[11:58:56] <djQuery> $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(e){});
[11:59:01] <thowe> I have a template on the page that I use to set them up, then I add a hidden element to differentiate them.
[11:59:24] <djQuery> ?on@thowe
[11:59:25] <bot-t> thowe, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:02:11] <djQuery> systemfault, in my case this is money not percentages so .30 does exist
[12:02:46] <systemfault> djQuery: People in the financial section would laugh at your for using float to calculate money ;)
[12:02:52] <systemfault> s/section/sector
[12:03:23] <systemfault> floats are not precise.
[12:03:39] <systemfault> It's their nature, there's no way to fix that other than not using them
[12:03:40] <djQuery> systemfault, so what should I use then
[12:03:47] <jasonthesensei> quick question is it better to use function(e){ e.preventDefaul() or return false when clicking abutton
[12:04:02] <systemfault> djQuery: You could do you calculations with cents for example.
[12:04:58] <grafi> mind blown
[12:05:12] <djQuery> systemfault, you mean multiply all by 100 first do the addition then divide by 100
[12:05:35] <systemfault> djQuery: Or work with cents all the way… formatting the number only when displaying it to the user
[12:06:06] <djQuery> systemfault, well I want the user to be able to say that he was tipped .3
[12:06:24] <systemfault> .3 cent?
[12:06:42] <djQuery> .30 of a dollar
[12:07:07] <djQuery> systemfault, http://jsbin.com/tipper/12
[12:07:22] <thowe> It's running the function on page load.  I guess because the template is there, but the event defined is 'submit' so I don't know why it would run on load.
[12:08:13] <systemfault> djQuery: It doesn't work well here :/
[12:08:43] <systemfault> djQuery: I get an alert then there's a the big blue button overlapped the bottom input
[12:09:03] <djQuery> systemfault, alert has been removed
[12:09:36] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/tipper/15/     just type any number into the input the tab out
[12:14:05] <djQuery> think this does it now. $header.text(Math.round(total*100)/100);
[12:14:26] <jamesdotnet> Why not total.toFixed(2)?
[12:15:33] <djQuery> jamesdotnet, thanks that looks better
[12:15:54] <systemfault> I wish I knew it was only a formatting issue :/
[12:16:19] <jamesdotnet> Or if you don't want any extra 0's then something like String.prototype.trimZero = function() { return this.replace(/^0+|0+$/g,''); };
[12:16:40] <JBlitzen> I have a droppable div containing some other div's.  If I drop a draggable div on it, is there a simple way to figure out where it fits in the sequence of other divs?  Like get the first div above its dropped y coordinate?
[12:16:46] <djQuery> jamesdotnet, , systemfault, and it looks like tofixed handles rounding issues as well
[12:17:00] <JBlitzen> I could loop through every div and check the position that way but it seems excessive
[12:18:14] <djQuery> JBlitzen, dont know it it is positioning them relative or actualy putting them in order. but you might look at see ?next
[12:18:15] <bot-t> JBlitzen, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:18:25] <djQuery> JBlitzen, or see ?.prev
[12:18:26] <bot-t> JBlitzen, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[12:18:33] <jamesdotnet> djQuery: the rounding issues are still there, just hidden :)
[12:18:44] <JBlitzen> Hmm, that's a thought
[12:18:48] <JBlitzen> Thanks!
[12:19:04] <djQuery> ?eval 34.448.toFixed(2)
[12:19:05] <bot-t> djQuery: "34.45"
[12:19:25] <djQuery> jamesdotnet, no it correctly rounded up there
[12:19:46] <djQuery> ?eval 34.458.toFixed(2)
[12:19:47] <bot-t> djQuery: "34.46"
[12:20:11] <djQuery> ?eval 34.999.toFixed(2)
[12:20:11] <bot-t> djQuery: "35.00"
[12:20:25] <systemfault> djQuery: It's a formatting function :P
[12:23:13] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:23:59] <jamesdotnet> Be careful of this though:
[12:24:04] <jamesdotnet> ?eval [(.465).toFixed(2), (.475).toFixed(2)]
[12:24:05] <bot-t> jamesdotnet: ["0.47", "0.47"]
[12:25:07] <jamesdotnet> banker's rounding or whatever they call it
[12:25:55] <zykes-> &win 38
[12:31:50] <thowe> grr...  It triggers the function I have bound to the submit event on creation but not on submit!

[13:17:44] <Aero`> Hi guys ! Would anyone have time to look at a kinda special AJAX request ? Thanks for the help !
[13:17:45] <Aero`> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14800269/sending-both-form-serialized-data-and-an-array-of-ids-through-ajax
[13:18:18] <djQuery> nope
[13:19:14] <djQuery> Aero`, y don
[13:19:25] <raj> djQuery, you asked for a demo to understand "searching for substring in an array"
[13:19:42] <raj> what's going on with that?
[13:19:42] <djQuery> y dont you just add inputs with the name to the form before serializing it
[13:20:01] <gates> When I load a pages in a certain order I see an error in console, "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '_renderItem' of undefined" that I just cannot make heads or tails of, its usually on a line with just HTML on it thats like a div tag or somethings imple
[13:20:19] <gates> It makes all myJQ objects break though
[13:20:29] <gates> Any thoughts for finding a solution?
[13:21:14] <gates> I am using jQM too
[13:21:58] <Geekle> [22:09] <Geekle> I am very weak in jquery skill I do not really understand what you tell me my specialty is the integration html css and webdesign [22:10] <Geekle> could you give me correct my code on the links that I gave you
[13:23:50] <dblosevn_away> gates: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5590776/why-am-i-getting-this-js-error
[13:23:59] <gates> Here are some maybe useful? logs http://pastebin.com/Zwh1LX2g
[13:24:18] <dblosevn_away> not sure if your using autocomplete but even if your not it is probally a simliar error
[13:24:49] <gates> I am, ill go from the "home" to the "create" (which has autocomplete) and then back to the "home
[13:25:04] <gates>  and everything breaks but maybe since its jQuery mobile the ajax overlap of pages is causing that issue, thans
[13:25:06] <gates> thanks*
[13:26:19] <dblosevn_away> keep in mind with jQm you cannot have any overlap of ids on any page in the app
[13:27:17] <dblosevn_away> eg having <input id="auto-com" on 2 pages is a no no being both apges can be loaded in the dom at once
[13:27:33] <gates> yeah i noticed that too, thats for CSS too or just jQuery calls?
[13:28:04] <dblosevn_away> not sure i follow you
[13:28:46] <gates> I noticed the ID matching issue, does it cause just a JS identify issue (like this #element) or a CSS styled issue (matching CSS) or both?
[13:29:22] <JBlitzen> Geekle
[13:29:23] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/KsQ3P/7/
[13:29:31] <JBlitzen> Click the red
[13:29:33] <JBlitzen> Then work from there
[13:30:00] <dblosevn_away> well reguardless of whether it causes an issue, you shouldnt use an id more then once on a page, and jquery will only return the first instance of #id
[13:30:22] <Aero`> @djQuery : "y don" ? sorry ?
[13:30:30] <gates> dblosevn_away: true and if i have two types of create pages and the ID is on both then it should be a class :| i understand, thanks.
[13:30:41] <dblosevn_away> css tends to still style all elements but its technically invalid
[13:32:14] <gates> dblosevn_away: truth, whats weird about that error is its on the page /after/ the auto complete :|
[13:32:24] <EdwardIII> hrm, is there a way i can use a var as a key in a dictionary? e.g. var key_name = 'cornholio'; var dict = { key_name: 'bungholio' } # and key_name will actually get set to 'cornholio'?
[13:32:38] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  I would infact that when I click on the gray opens its still up I click again on the gray and closes but I searched and I is not found
[13:33:37] <gates> BUT
[13:33:43] <gates> i am using ".data( "autocomplete" )._renderItem = function( ul, item ) { ....." like you
[13:33:45] <JBlitzen> Geekle, that did not make sense in any language
[13:33:54] <gates> like your example**
[13:34:02] <JBlitzen> Rephrase it, use more words to help clarify what you're asking, Geekle
[13:35:10] <grafi> no EdwardIII key_name will be key_name, you can however do dict = {} and then dict[key_name] = 'blub'
[13:35:38] <raj> can I adjust how http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ will match results?
[13:35:54] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  there is a gray area that exceeds this is the button. This button is used to open the bar and closed by click only because currently it does not work like that, it folds to "hover"
[13:36:12] <Aero`> Hi guys ! Would anyone have time to look at a kinda special AJAX request ? Thanks for the help !
[13:36:15] <Aero`> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14800269/sending-both-form-serialized-data-and-an-array-of-ids-through-ajax
[13:39:22] <gates> dblosevn_away: it seems to be working, thanks
[13:43:47] <JBlitzen> Geekle, http://jsfiddle.net/KsQ3P/11/
[13:43:52] <JBlitzen> Try that
[13:44:06] <dblosevn> gates: np
[13:44:44] <dblosevn> wheres the open bar? i defintiely didnt find it last night lol
[13:46:09] <Geekle> JBlitzen: infact it is when its click opens when I click again it is open on the same area the area closes
[13:46:23] <Aero`> @007 : I'll give you as much vodka martini as you want if you help me sorting out my issue hehe :p
[13:46:29] <JBlitzen> Geekle, retype that, it made no sense
[13:48:01] <Geekle> JBlitzen: the gray is used to open when you click and click again when used to close above
[13:48:20] <JBlitzen> That still makes no sense
[13:48:28] <JBlitzen> You're telling me what a gray area is used for
[13:48:38] <dblosevn> Aero`: and what would that happen to be lol
[13:48:50] <JBlitzen> It's like saying "water is used for drinking"
[13:48:57] <JBlitzen> Form a complete sentence, geekle
[13:49:25] <Aero`> @007 : check it out there : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14800269/sending-both-form-serialized-data-and-an-array-of-ids-through-ajax
[13:49:40] <Aero`> I've been on this for two days
[13:49:45] <Aero`> I'm starting to be nervous lol
[13:49:48] <dblosevn> Aero`: didnt i solve that for you last night?
[13:49:55] <dblosevn> with like 2 lines of code?
[13:50:05] <Aero`> ? nope !
[13:50:08] <bot-t> Aero`, jQuery Mobile Docs - Switch - http://jq03.jquery.com/branches/3dtransform-test/docs/forms/switch/
[13:50:15] <Aero`> I haven't had any answer last night
[13:50:46] <Aero`> maybe you answered me when I was gone ??
[13:50:52] <dblosevn> Aero`: http://jsfiddle.net/Bpx4a/1/
[13:50:57] <Aero`> Sorry if that happened :s
[13:51:03] <dblosevn> thats what i did before i went to the bar last night
[13:51:28] <dblosevn> maybe it wasnt you being it doesnt append an array of ids
[13:51:35] <dblosevn> but it still works
[13:52:04] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  if I click on the gray bar should be open. If it is open, then closes the by clicking a second time ('im french)
[13:52:13] <dblosevn> Aero`: http://jsfiddle.net/X9fAv/
[13:52:15] <Aero`> I'll check it out, thanks !
[13:52:24] <JBlitzen> I know they have complete sentences in france
[13:52:26] <dblosevn> that does however append a list of ids to the post
[13:52:34] <JBlitzen> Geekle, don't use hover then, use click
[13:53:01] <dblosevn> now about my alcohol :-D
[13:54:38] <Geekle> I tried to remove the hover, but this does not bar appears when I click but it no longer closes
[13:55:46] <thowe> When I do  "$(something).on('submit', myfunction(event));"  my error console says event is not defined...  Why is that?
[13:55:56] <sirspazzolot> so I've been struggling with this for hours and it's really not tough at all. trying to insert a button on a facebook page for a greasemonkey script. I have it working on several other pages, just not this one (the members page of a facebook group). what is wrong with this line? http://pastebin.com/HTF4quW4
[13:56:26] <Aero`> @007 : It doesn't work :( Here's what I send : $.extend({selectedIds : selectedIds}, $("#editinfoform").serialize());
[13:56:52] <Aero`> it works for the ID's array, but the serialized data are cut and being sent each char after another
[13:57:04] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  I tried to remove the hover, but this does not bar appears when I click but it no longer closes
[13:57:34] <JBlitzen> Geekle, you need to expand your click event
[13:57:39] <JBlitzen> If the margin left is 370px, set it to 0
[13:57:43] <JBlitzen> If it's 0, set it to 370px
[13:57:46] <Gestahlt_> Hi guys
[13:57:55] <JBlitzen> I don't know how to get the current margin left, but it shouldn't be hard
[13:58:21] <thowe> sirspazzolot, your pastbin URL doesn't load for me
[13:58:50] <thowe> seems pastebin is down for me

[13:59:13] <Gestahlt_> I build myself a little menu. The issue is, i need a delayed fade-in. Fadein is no problem, but when the mouse hovers over the element (an <ul>) i want to have a little delay. the delay method is not cancelable and thus no alternative
[13:59:29] <dblosevn> Aero`: also say my whole name `dblosevn` so i get an alert on my desktop
[13:59:34] <Gestahlt_> So basically it should only show when i stay with the mouse in the ul
[13:59:42] <raj> shokyjuice shokyjuice shokyjuice
[13:59:45] <Gestahlt_> for a x amount of time
[13:59:45] <sirspazzolot> thowe it works over here ._. I'll go use a clone
[14:00:12] <nesoi> hey does this look right? $('#'+ID).css("background-color", "#FAA460");
[14:00:25] <Gestahlt_> "background"
[14:00:28] <Gestahlt_> not color
[14:00:30] <sirspazzolot> thowe http://bpaste.net/show/0zZxermBCFF7Vq8G13yv/
[14:00:56] <nesoi> hmm... background-color works elsewhere...
[14:01:04] <nesoi> anything else look wrong with it?
[14:01:17] <Aero`> dblosevn : check your IRC PM please, the page is password protected
[14:01:18] <Gestahlt_> nesoi: if it works? I dunno. I always use background only
[14:01:27] <nesoi> is background-color deprecated or something?
[14:02:42] <Gestahlt_> hmm
[14:02:57] <Gestahlt_> Doesnt really look like it. I just checked. Its to me the same as "background"
[14:03:05] <Gestahlt_> i didnt even knew background-color exists
[14:03:14] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  can you show me how I am trying to test it, but its not working
[14:03:37] <JBlitzen> I don't know how, geekle
[14:04:32] <JBlitzen> Ask this question for the rest of the channel, geekle: "how do I handle a click event such that if margin-left is 370px, it becomes 0px, but if it's 0px, it becomes 370px?"
[14:04:39] <JBlitzen> Channel ^
[14:05:01] <nesoi> $('#whatever') selects the element with an id="whatever"?
[14:05:55] <thowe> depricating toggle really fucked me up today...
[14:07:00] <Geekle> JBlitzen:  if use : while ?
[14:07:48] <JBlitzen> if then
[14:09:16] <JBlitzen> It'll be something like this, geekle:
[14:09:16] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/KsQ3P/12/
[14:09:31] <JBlitzen> I don't know what this line would actually be:
[14:09:32] <JBlitzen>  if (marginleft is 370px)
[14:09:42] <JBlitzen> That's just pseudocode but it shouldn't be difficult
[14:11:32] <nesoi> for some reason it's not working. is $("#myID") the same as $('#'+id) where var id="myID" ?
[14:12:20] <nesoi> oh wait, I'm dumb
[14:12:37] <Geekle> its not work JBlitzen
[14:13:19] <Gestahlt_> Exactly nesoi
[14:18:18] <sirspazzolot> okay well I gave up on that feature because I don't even need it. my impressions from working with jquery (apart from that) are that it's magical and I really like it
[14:23:36] <tw2113> like a unicorn!
[14:32:25] <Geekle> JBlitzen: its not work I tested many ways but its not working
[14:42:12] <Gestahlt_> I must be stupid
[14:42:15] <Gestahlt_> i dont get it work
[14:43:13] <Gestahlt_> i want to build a menu that only shows when i hover the containing element for like 2 seconds
[14:43:59] <Gestahlt_> I tried it with setTimeout and i dont get it working.. Delay is completly the wrong direction since delay will trigger the menu anyway after 2 seconds
[14:53:30] <dblosevn> magical++
[14:54:29] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: thats easy
[14:55:11] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: first bind a hover listener to the container and add a class something like is-hovered
[14:55:37] <Gestahlt_> dblosevn: I used mouseenter. Should make no difference, right?
[14:55:52] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: setTimout for 2000 ms to drop down the list
[14:56:22] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: but before dropping it down test if container hasClass is-hovered
[14:56:36] <dblosevn> on hover out remove class is-hovered
[14:56:58] <dreamingrainbow> hi everyone
[14:57:50] <dreamingrainbow> is there something special i have to do to make a cross browser connection , i was trying to use an ajax call
[14:58:29] <dreamingrainbow> I get an error and thought if i set Origin that might work .. but it doesnt....
[14:58:32] <czytacz> hi, http://jsfiddle.net/6ES6U/ - how can i disable <a> functionality but still be able to call a click() function of parent element? <a> has to fill its parent in 100%
[14:59:24] <tw2113> czytacz, http://jsfiddle.net/6ES6U/1/
[14:59:25] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/73
[15:00:07] <Gestahlt_> thanks, will try that
[15:00:39] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: i like hover bvetter as you gfet both callbacks at once, first is enter second is out
[15:00:52] <czytacz> tw2113: that was easy :) thanks
[15:01:06] <osirisx11> hi can someone please suggest how to evenly space and fill available width using ul/li or divs
[15:02:10] <dblosevn> osirisx11: depends on the layout your going for
[15:02:12] <dreamingrainbow> http://pastebin.com/NNCJVEue Here is what i have..
[15:02:26] <osirisx11> dblosevn: i'm trying to make a timeline
[15:02:36] <osirisx11> N items spread across parent container
[15:02:43] <dblosevn> so you want them layed out horizonally then
[15:02:48] <osirisx11> yes
[15:03:00] <tw2113> i can't wait for wider flexbox support
[15:04:01] <Stephen> I can't wait for someone to overload WebRTC to allow for client-to-client socket communications
[15:04:06] <Stephen> you know it's gonna happen
[15:04:31] <dblosevn> var $el = $('#ul'); var count = $el.find('li').length; var width = $el.width() / count; $el.find('li').width(width);
[15:04:35] <osirisx11> Stephen: all it would take to start it would be some rogue deployments of altered firefox and chrome :D
[15:04:53] <dblosevn> @ osirisx11
[15:04:58] <Stephen> Don't even need that far
[15:05:15] <osirisx11> thx dblosevn would it be too much to ask if you would please fiddle that for me?
[15:05:32] <Stephen> all you need is the raw access to one of the datafeeds, and possibly a canvas element as a bridge
[15:05:40] <Stephen> Likely TypedArrays could handle it though
[15:05:41] <dblosevn> im walking with my laptop it will be a few minute
[15:05:53] <Gestahlt_> dblosevn: It still wont work.. and i cant figure the reason why. It works good as long as i do not use a timeout
[15:05:59] <dblosevn> freeing outside in 2 degree weather smoking lol
[15:06:10] <osirisx11> lol dblosevn im in wisconsin i hear you
[15:06:35] <Gestahlt_> dblosevn: Basic debug does work.. means instead my call (which usually works) i use a alert to check if the timeout is working.. and it is
[15:07:00] <dblosevn> $this = $(this); is important
[15:07:13] <dblosevn> you wont be able to find the target without it in the timeout
[15:07:22] <Gestahlt_> Oh?
[15:07:26] <Gestahlt_> I try that
[15:07:33] <dblosevn> this in tsetTimeout is window
[15:07:56] <Gestahlt_> Ah
[15:07:59] <dblosevn> or more appropriately the context of setTimeout is window
[15:08:13] <Gestahlt_> Because setimout is a reguar js call and $(this) is jquery?
[15:08:35] <dblosevn> setTimeout is window.setTimeout
[15:08:47] <dblosevn> window is the base object hence its the context
[15:09:58] <dblosevn> but being your setTimeout is in the same scope as $this you can still access $this
[15:10:33] <Gestahlt_> This is my selector and action now: $this.children(".smart_menu_items").show('blind');
[15:10:36] <Gestahlt_> and this doesnt work

[15:11:03] <Gestahlt_> k
[15:11:07] <Gestahlt_> but that is kinda hard
[15:11:21] <dblosevn> its even harder denbugging something i cant see
[15:11:21] <Gestahlt_> because.. lotsa js.. the li are also added dynamically
[15:11:31] <Gestahlt_> Okay i try
[15:11:39] <dblosevn> i dont want all that just want the menu with a little css
[15:11:53] <dblosevn> and what your trying to do to expand it
[15:12:17] <Gestahlt_> Okay. I just copy and paste my file
[15:17:54] <dblosevn> osirisx11: http://jsfiddle.net/uDRQK/
[15:18:32] <osirisx11> thanks dblosevn! i need it to add margin to space it to the full container width also
[15:18:50] <osirisx11> i will run it on resize
[15:19:08] <Gestahlt_> GRRR i just cleared my fiddle by accident
[15:19:13] <dblosevn> well you get the idea you can add all that in as you see i already accounted for borders
[15:19:20] <Gestahlt_> Man getting all that partial stuff together is mean
[15:19:38] <Gestahlt_> Wait
[15:19:44] <Gestahlt_> Can js fiddle even work with scss?
[15:20:04] <dblosevn> ?
[15:20:12] <dblosevn> theres a block for css on the top right
[15:20:22] <tw2113> sass css, not plain css
[15:20:33] <tw2113> i don't believe jsfiddle compiles sass
[15:20:43] <Gestahlt_> not sass. scss
[15:20:53] <tw2113> yeah, sass
[15:21:03] <Gestahlt_> okay sass then
[15:21:06] <tw2113> what do you think the first S stands for
[15:21:11] <Gestahlt_> stupid?
[15:21:14] <dblosevn> lol
[15:21:16] <tw2113> Sass CSS
[15:21:38] <dblosevn> sassy css?
[15:21:42] <Susan> I'm the sassmaster.
[15:22:01] <Gestahlt_> I know that there are kinda 2 variants to do your css.. the way where it doesnt look like css at all and the other way that looks like sane css
[15:22:12] <Gestahlt_> susan : -s
[15:22:14] <dblosevn> or ... Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets
[15:22:27] <dblosevn> ala wikipedia
[15:22:41] <tw2113> regardess
[15:22:48] <tw2113> i don't think jsfiddle compiles it
[15:23:35] <Gestahlt_> i just use that thing that looks like css with much nicer inheritances and mixins.. I cannot really differ.. on the sass homepage its the .scss variant
[15:24:14] <Gestahlt_> ow man, okay, redoing the fiddle.. i wont need the css anyway there.. except for size and such
[15:24:43] <tw2113> sass uses the scss file extension
[15:25:22] <Stephen> heh, there's also LESS
[15:25:56] <dimtiris5> Hello, can you guys please help? I am no js developer and having some problems. I am getting "TypeError: o.nodeName is undefined" over here http://shoutkey.com/jell
[15:29:11] <czytacz> how can I append loaded html file into a div? I dont want to use 'temporary" divs for it, just append file contents
[15:30:14] <czytacz> just  .load() simply replaces divs contents, so it's no good
[15:30:54] <czytacz> I've tried a few shots with append() and load() combinations but it doesn't work
[15:31:22] <Gestahlt_> There
[15:31:23] <Gestahlt_> http://jsfiddle.net/Q56tY/1/
[15:33:19] <osirisx11> thanks dblosevn! you've helped me a lot i think
[15:33:37] <dblosevn_away> ill be back in like 10 mins
[15:33:42] <Gestahlt_> Man i hate JS so much
[15:33:57] <dblosevn_away> you chose the worng profession then :-)
[15:35:00] <tw2113> some day, it'll just click and you'll fall in love
[15:36:01] <czytacz> I found a way, so scratch that case
[15:36:18] <Gestahlt_> dbloseven: Like hell! I never wanted to do JS, HTML and CSS.. I hate it alltogether. I prefer shellscript and im happy with my 8000 line shellscripts without objects and stuff..
[15:37:18] <Gestahlt_> dbloseven: I even wonder why JS managed getting so big. The syntax is driving me up walls.. i want my gwbasic back.. and qbasic.. and AmigaBasic.. and C 64 basic.. Visual Basic can rot in hell
[15:37:47] <Gestahlt_> Ruby is okay.. sometimes
[15:37:59] <Gestahlt_> If all the people wouldnt lie about types
[15:38:07] <tw2113> how'd you get stuck with this debugging?
[15:38:53] <Gestahlt_> By deleting inserting and just commenting out what i might reuse
[15:39:44] <Gestahlt_> I have a working method without delay
[15:40:02] <Gestahlt_> and it is as simple as line 13 in a mouseenter event
[15:40:27] <Gestahlt_> but i need the delay
[15:40:41] <Gestahlt_> otherwise it is like.. wtf came that menu from and ooh unexpected annoying
[15:41:05] <Gestahlt_> This menu is only for restoring widgets
[15:41:30] <Gestahlt_> You close a widget, then it gets added to the menu, you click on the item, widget gets restored and menu entry removed
[15:41:43] <Gestahlt_> removal process is line 58.. also works
[15:41:52] <Gestahlt_> im only missing the delay and i am done with that
[15:42:57] <dimtiris5> Hello, can you guys please help? I am no js developer and having some problems. I am getting "TypeError: o.nodeName is undefined" over here http://shoutkey.com/jell
[15:46:18] <czytacz> is there any way to make elements load with 0 opacity at default? I'm appending them with appendTo() function
[15:47:18] <tw2113> css czytacz
[15:48:40] <melfy> czytacz: ^ add a class to it :P
[15:48:44] <czytacz> tw2113: but the problem is that if I make cange to my css, the page won't be displayed correctly with js off
[15:48:58] <tw2113> .css() then
[15:49:46] <czytacz> but wont .css() work too late? I mean will it make loaded elements hidden before they are displayed on screen?
[15:50:04] <shoky> just add a class.
[15:50:16] <shoky> then just add an entry to the css.
[15:50:19] <shoky> for that class only
[15:51:41] <czytacz> ill try
[15:56:27] <dblosevn> czytacz: var search_input = $(this).val(); should probally be var search_input = $('.search-input').val();
[15:57:49] <czytacz> dblosevn: i think you wanted to send it to dimtiris5
[15:58:09] <dblosevn> oh oops im blind lmao
[15:58:22] <dblosevn> @ dimtiris5
[15:59:26] <dimtiris5> dblosevn: The error is gone but the variable is undefined now
[16:00:18] <dblosevn> dimtiris5: my bad var search_input = $('.search_input').val();
[16:00:41] <Engin> is there a find in reverse direction ?
[16:00:43] <dblosevn> dimtiris5: sorry I never use _ in class names and didnt see you did
[16:00:55] <Engin> searched up to parents... I want to find first upper div
[16:01:05] <Engin> i can do a recursive parent()
[16:01:30] <dblosevn> $(this).closest('div.container')
[16:01:56] <dblosevn> would find the closest div with class container above the child node
[16:02:23] <dimtiris5> dblosevn: Thanks man :) It works now
[16:02:38] <Engin> ok thanks
[16:02:51] <dblosevn> np x2
[16:10:01] <dblosevn> osirisx11: http://jsfiddle.net/uDRQK/1/ something i just thought of while iw as downstairs, my orginal didnt work so well this one is only off by a pixel or 2
[16:10:47] <osirisx11> thanks dblosevn but this is more what im looking for: http://jsfiddle.net/uDRQK/
[16:11:11] <osirisx11> the spaces on the ends are problematic for my particular usage
[16:11:33] <dblosevn> ? my second one fills the entire ul
[16:11:36] <osirisx11> i'd like a "justify"
[16:11:46] <osirisx11> yes but i need the margin gaps
[16:11:48] <dblosevn> my first one the math was wrong
[16:11:50] <osirisx11> it is a timeline
[16:12:05] <dblosevn> oh hold up
[16:12:35] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/uDRQK/2/
[16:12:35] <osirisx11> you see on mine i put it in resize
[16:12:37] <osirisx11> so you have to resize to see it
[16:12:38] <dblosevn> :-)
[16:12:44] <melfy> whats a good xml parser!
[16:13:11] <osirisx11> melfy: jquery
[16:13:11] <dblosevn> one that doesnt force quit on bad xml :-D
[16:13:39] <melfy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[16:14:11] <Foxhoundz> I never knew jQuery had methods to parse XML
[16:14:18] <Foxhoundz> Quite interesting.
[16:14:43] <melfy> yea im making a webbased xbmc skin editor :|
[16:15:26] <dblosevn> Foxhoundz: ya it has to, you can tell $.ajax to request xml which would be dumb if jquery couldnt parse it
[16:15:27] <Foxhoundz> Ah, is the XML to export the finished product?
[16:15:56] <melfy> gotta import edit & hopefully export :/
[16:16:07] <melfy> who knows we'll see!
[16:16:18] <dblosevn> ?g jquery serialize xml
[16:16:19] <Foxhoundz> Is it open sourced and on github? ;-)

[16:16:50] <melfy> its basically a copy paste from the jquery xml link above
[16:16:56] <melfy> starting it now
[16:17:04] <melfy> and no its not on git i'm lazy
[16:17:21] <melfy> its all client side so basically anyone can run it locally :P
[16:18:25] <Foxhoundz> I need a weekend project
[16:18:32] <Foxhoundz> I was hoping to fork your work and tinker with it
[16:23:02] <melfy>  localStorage.setItem("flag", "set");
[16:23:06] <melfy> chrome storage that easy?
[16:23:23] <melfy> Foxhoundz: meh it's part 1 of my weekend project :P
[16:23:33] <melfy> gonna use it to theme navixtreme
[16:23:47] <Gestahlt_> dblosevn:  have you an idea whats wrong with mine?
[16:32:39] <melfy> Foxhoundz: dont forget to ask me about it later! if i dont finish u should finish for me:P
[16:32:57] <Foxhoundz> ha
[16:36:49] <Es0teric> ok so i have an $.each() loop that goes through a var with multiple arrays in it and it returns only the last value of a key... now how do i loop through it without it returning the last value and just looping through everything normally?
[16:37:56] <melfy> return false
[16:38:01] <melfy> at end
[16:38:22] <melfy> $(this) is probably getting overwritten in last loop
[16:40:46] <Es0teric> melfy it just returns one result...
[16:40:56] <Es0teric> out of the multiple results that are there
[16:41:32] <melfy> so do something in that $.each?
[16:41:54] <melfy> $.each(array, function() { // handle element });
[16:42:06] <Es0teric> melfy i am already doing something in the each...
[16:43:59] <Es0teric> melfy consider this.. var data = [ { key1: "val1", key2 : "val2", key3 : "val3", key4 : [ { "i" : "vali1", "a" : "val-a1" }, { "i" : "vali1", "a" : "val-a1" } ] }, etc.. ] etc...
[16:44:49] <Es0teric> i have a $.each in that data looping through it, i want to extract data.key4.i everytime... not pull the last data.key4.i
[16:45:37] <Es0teric> melfy so in reality, i have $.each(data, function() { //data loop  });
[16:45:39] <luvmyh0nda> Good afternoon... Any advice on referencing the index for a draggable + sortable?
[16:47:06] <tw2113> Es0teric, do you know what the key is for the data you want, and is it going to be consistent?
[16:47:19] <Es0teric> tw2113 yes it is going to be consistent
[16:47:24] <Es0teric> and yes i do know what the key is
[16:47:45] <tw2113> why do you technicaly need an $.each() loop for this then?
[16:48:03] <Es0teric> tw2113 because its data in a array being returned from json_encode()
[16:48:03] <tw2113> couldn't you just pull it out specifically from the object?
[16:48:26] <Es0teric> tw2113 the thing is that i am trying to pull an ID that will be attached to a click() out of a list of books
[16:48:34] <tw2113> couldn't you just reference data.key4.i and get the data that way?
[16:49:21] <Es0teric> tw2113 no, because again, when a book is clicked, i will have an ID attached to it... that will take the user to the next page with more details with that book because of the ID
[16:49:54] <tw2113> you could throw an if statement in the loop
[16:50:04] <tw2113> and if the current iteration matches the key you want, return it
[16:50:20] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: did you paste me a link?
[16:50:29] <Gestahlt_> yeah
[16:50:32] <dblosevn> sorry i walked away for a bit
[16:50:46] <Gestahlt_> http://jsfiddle.net/Q56tY/1/
[16:51:20] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: http://jsfiddle.net/Q56tY/2/
[16:51:21] <dblosevn> done
[16:52:02] <Gestahlt_> The var IN the function call?
[16:52:10] <dblosevn> you had $this = $(this) outside of the listener
[16:52:12] <Es0teric> tw2113 wait
[16:52:22] <Es0teric> how would this if statement check?
[16:52:47] <dblosevn> so technically $this was $(window);
[16:53:00] <tw2113> inside the loop, after you've figured out how to check the current iterating item
[16:53:08] <tw2113> use == to see if it matches the one you want
[16:53:32] <Es0teric> like... if (v.bookInfo.i  === v.bookInfo.i) {  $('.btn').on('click', function() { window.location = "book.php?id=someid"  }); } ?
[16:53:49] <Es0teric> in the each, tw2113
[16:54:12] <dblosevn> although thats nothing like what my code looked like lol
[16:54:54] <tw2113> if that's what your keys and whatnot match that
[16:55:23] <melfy> Es0teric:  var mykey4 = data.key4 ?
[16:55:24] <tw2113> Es0teric, got a fiddle or something with what you have so far?
[16:55:48] <Es0teric> tw2113 uh... i can make one...
[16:56:05] <tw2113> you know we thrive on fiddles and pastebins by now :P
[16:56:26] <Gestahlt_> I dont get it.. but thanks a lot dblosevn
[16:57:42] <Es0teric> tw2113 yeah lol... give me a few mins, i'll post something up
[16:59:17] <gaf> hello fellows, i'm doing a lil text based game with jquery with some friends, and i would like your honest opinion about the code base  https://github.com/JS-workshop/Text-Adventure-Games/blob/master/bcca/js/cosby.js
[16:59:42] <Ziber> I want an animation to occur a few seconds after the page loads, but sleep() isn't a defined function apparently?
[17:00:17] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: http://jsfiddle.net/MWgQ8/1/
[17:00:43] <dblosevn> little better cleaner and actually closes the dropdown on hoverout
[17:01:04] <coldhead> gaf: availableDirections seems to be a global
[17:01:10] <coldhead> are you running jshint on this?
[17:01:49] <coldhead> it looks quite nice and clean otherwise
[17:02:44] <coldhead> you might make the code more generic to handle multiple locations as that's likely to be a thing
[17:02:58] <Gestahlt_> Thank you very much Mr. Bond. You save the me the hassle :)
[17:04:02] <dblosevn> Gestahlt_: you were really close, but it would help you a lot to learn about scope in javascript
[17:04:30] <Gestahlt_> I have to.. Its still very confusing to me.. at least the most stuff is
[17:04:32] <yedi> if element is a dom object, will this be equivalent: `return element` and `return $(element).html()`
[17:05:01] <yedi> if not, how can i get the dom object from a jquery var holding one dom element
[17:05:23] <Foxhoundz> gaf: line 33
[17:05:30] <gaf> coldhead, ty for the comments. i didnn't lint yet
[17:05:34] <Foxhoundz> change i+=1 to i++;
[17:05:45] <gaf> why?
[17:05:46] <dblosevn> ?g javascript scope tutorial @ Gestahlt_
[17:05:47] <b-ot> Gestahlt_: Sorry, no results for ‟javascript scope tutorial @ Gestahlt_”.

[17:06:38] <coldhead> it will save you a byte, gaf >_>
[17:06:46] <gaf> k
[17:07:05] <dblosevn> lol every byte counts
[17:07:45] <coldhead> it's precious bandwidth that could be going to use for pornography or online gambling
[17:07:55] <dblosevn> or spam
[17:07:55] <Foxhoundz> if you're just incrementing by one, I don't see why i += 1 is needed
[17:07:58] <tw2113> Es0teric, note we don't need your ENTIRE setup
[17:08:07] <tw2113> i was asking for an example of your attempted $.each loop
[17:09:20] <gaf> ok, it is done, thanks
[17:09:24] <gaf> ^^
[17:09:35] <Es0teric> tw2113 i am aware... i am just copying my $.each() loop and creating dummy data
[17:09:54] <tw2113> for 12 minutes?
[17:10:00] <Es0teric> i was eating, dude...
[17:10:05] <tw2113> ah
[17:10:08] <tw2113> didn't know that
[17:10:13] <Es0teric> yeah lol
[17:10:18] <coldhead> now we all know
[17:10:18] <Es0teric> i am copying the stuff now
[17:10:22] <coldhead> good job everyone
[17:10:33] <coldhead> i'm going to be eating in about 65 minutes
[17:10:40] <tw2113> *drinks*
[17:10:41] <coldhead> well i'm going to a record store first
[17:10:48] <coldhead> but after that: club sandwich
[17:10:56] <coldhead> let me know if i can pick anything up for you
[17:10:57] <tw2113> club music, club sandwich
[17:10:59] <tw2113> fitting coldy
[17:11:57] <coldhead> i like the way your mind notices two things
[17:13:49] <coldhead> anyway what were you eating Es0teric ?
[17:20:04] <Es0teric> coldhead well im dominican so basically rice and chicken
[17:21:22] <coldhead> respect
[17:27:55] <Es0teric> tw2113 -> http://jsfiddle.net/RG2Ke/
[17:29:16] <Es0teric> and no doubt, coldhead
[17:29:16] <Es0teric> lol
[17:33:27] <tw2113> i find it interesting that you have nested appends
[17:34:12] <Es0teric> lol really, tw2113 ?
[17:34:22] <tw2113> never seen that before
[17:36:15] <Es0teric> tw2113 well... its one way to get what i wanted done
[17:36:16] <Es0teric> lol
[17:37:40] <tw2113> and what's the key you're trying to do what with?
[17:38:07] <Es0teric> v.book.i, tw2113
[17:38:26] <tw2113> at what point
[17:38:37] <Es0teric> on every .btn click
[17:38:46] <Es0teric> because i want it to carry that ID into the url
[17:40:23] <tw2113> and this isn't working?
[17:40:25] <tw2113> window.location = "book.php?id=" + v.book.i;
[17:40:27] <melfy> omg
[17:40:37] <melfy> just now finding javascript console!
[17:41:18] <Es0teric> tw2113 exactly... it just takes the last v.book.i of the array and puts it on the ID no matter which li i click
[17:41:20] <tw2113> and why is nothing showing up in the result panel?
[17:41:26] <Es0teric> tw2113 that one, i dont know
[17:41:26] <Es0teric> >.>
[17:42:15] <tw2113> well, this: v.book.i; gets replaced on every iteration
[17:42:46] <tw2113> you need to assign and associate a variable or something for each button, holding the data you want to be assigned
[17:43:10] <Es0teric> tw2113 theres only one button....
[17:43:18] <Es0teric> the id changes when the user clicks on li
[17:43:18] <tw2113> and you only want it to have 1 value?
[17:43:32] <tw2113> one specific one from the entire json object
[17:43:40] <Es0teric> tw2113 yes the LAST one
[17:43:49] <tw2113> no, that's the one that keeps showing up
[17:43:52] <tw2113> not the one you WANT
[17:44:11] <Es0teric> tw2113 yes
[17:44:18] <Es0teric> i get that.. so then how would i go about approaching that?
[17:44:20] <Es0teric> on one button
[17:44:47] <tw2113> which value do you want that button to be?
[17:46:47] <Es0teric> tw2113 its .btn
[17:47:03] <Es0teric> wait value... no value would be the id that is grabbed when clicking on a <li>
[17:47:10] <tw2113> from this
[17:47:10] <tw2113> http://pastebin.com/znNtZJ2m
[17:47:19] <tw2113> what do you want attached to the url in the on() for that .btn
[17:47:47] <tw2113> because that's the stuff you're looping over
[17:48:08] <tw2113> which instance of data.book.i do you want to be on that button
[17:48:20] <Es0teric> tw2113 i want it to start with the first book id
[17:48:50] <tw2113> so you need multiple .btn's and each one needs a unique book.i ?
[17:49:26] <Es0teric> so lets say "some book title1" was clicked, it would pop up the modal with bookInfo attached with "some book title1" and in that modal, i want the v.book.i associated with that
[17:49:53] <Es0teric> so its multiple v.book.i that i want... the one that is retrieved on click of <li>
[17:50:05] <tw2113> because based on your html markup, there's only 1 link with .btn
[17:50:15] <Es0teric> tw2113 i understand that
[17:50:19] <Es0teric> but in order to avoid redundancy
[17:50:33] <Es0teric> i just want one button and the ID to replace itself when a <li> is clicked
[17:50:59] <Es0teric> so i dont have multiple buttons for one click... i just have one button that alters its id based on what the user clicked
[17:51:30] <tw2113> well with an each in this situation, it's always going to end up on the last one
[17:52:13] <Es0teric> tw2113 i realize that...
[17:52:23] <Es0teric> so how can i fix that?
[17:52:59] <tw2113> not completely sure, i'd probably end up trying a data-attributes solution
[17:53:10] <tw2113> attach the v.book.i value to them
[17:53:36] <tw2113> and then outside of the each loop, do the .on() click and grab the data-attribute and attach it to the url
[17:54:20] <tw2113> maybe
[17:54:27] <tw2113> that'd actually work more for multiple buttons
[17:54:28] <tw2113> shit
[17:54:44] <tw2113> i dunno
[17:55:37] <Es0teric> also tw2113 the reason why it wont show on the results is because i have a syntax error
[17:55:38] <Es0teric> missing } after property list
[17:55:43] <Es0teric> on "categories"
[17:56:34] <Es0teric> damn i created a sample app on ror and im already forgetting to put in commas and semi-colons in js and php -_-
[17:57:12] <tw2113> *shrugs at the problem at hand*
[17:57:12] <b-ot> tw2113: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:57:34] <tw2113> thank you b-ot
[17:58:47] <Es0teric> tw2113 -> http://jsfiddle.net/RG2Ke/4/
[17:58:57] <Es0teric> fixed the problem with syntax error
[18:00:02] <tw2113> there has to be someting you could attach the book.i to and grab in the modal
[18:00:51] <Es0teric> maybe coldhead might know? o.O
[18:01:21] <tw2113> it's his first day, he don't know
[18:01:43] <Es0teric> lol, tw2113
[18:02:37] <nesoi> hey so if I am on pageA and then go to pageB and then go back to pageA, what events are triggered when I return to pageA for the 2nd time?
[18:02:49] <nesoi> I am not getting pageinit or pageload, it seems
[18:09:46] <rgb247> I want to make a form on my site that sends data to another website form - if everything is ok I need to make a redirect to the second site
[18:09:58] <rgb247> is that possible with jquery?
[18:10:14] <rgb247> I'm receiving an error: remote allow access
[18:13:51] <yedi> if element is a dom object, will this be equivalent: `return element` and `return $(element).html()`
[18:14:01] <yedi> if not, how can i get the dom object from a jquery var holding one dom element
[18:14:15] <dblosevn> well coldhead will be eating in about 2 minutes lol
[18:21:37] <nesoi> no one here knows what events are triggered if you return to an already visited page?
[18:30:19] <danheberden> nesoi: there *are* no events
[18:30:29] <danheberden> you can make a cookie
[18:30:57] <danheberden> the that old trick of having a link to your page with a :visited style and checking its color
[18:31:20] <danheberden> but a cookie seems more succinct
[18:33:42] <coldhead> http://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html
[18:33:52] <coldhead> you can persist data through window.name, apparently
[18:34:01] <coldhead> chee showed me that
[18:34:11] <coldhead> it makes me uncomfortable
[18:34:45] <chee> danheberden: that doesxn't work now any more
[18:35:02] <danheberden> chee i'm showing my age apparently
[18:35:10] <chee> getComputedStyle and stuff
[18:35:19] <chee> show false results for link colours
[18:35:59] <chee> danheberden: you are the oldest man
[18:36:07] <chee> in the world
[18:37:16] <Foxhoundz> have you considered localStorage?
[18:38:37] <danheberden> Foxhoundz: careful, i think Cork has a highligh for `localStorage`
[18:38:41] <danheberden> *hightlight
[18:39:10] <Foxhoundz> ...what's wrong with localStroage?
[18:39:16] <coldhead> cork is probably scrambling out of the bathtub now to start dropping localStorage wisdom
[18:40:18] <nesoi> danheberden : so those events only fire the 1st time a page is loaded?
[18:40:24] <danheberden> Foxhoundz: i want to tell you, but i don't want to ruin it for cork
[18:40:42] <danheberden> nesoi: which events are you speaking of?
[18:40:51] <nesoi> pageinit, etc.
[18:44:32] <nesoi> danheberden : ?
[18:45:52] <danheberden> haven't heard of pageinit, but things like the load event on the window or body or DOMContentReady events are just once when the page is loaded
[18:45:59] <danheberden> nesoi: ^
[18:46:21] <nesoi> loaded once on first load, not again when the page is re-visited?
[18:47:06] <danheberden> if the page is re-visited, the page itself needs to be reloaded
[18:47:12] <danheberden> so the events will fire
[18:52:36] <nesoi> danheberden : I'm not seeing the events re-fire though
[18:52:41] <nesoi> do I need to do something else?
[18:57:05] <dblosevn> anybody know how your supossed to build ckeditor plugins?
[18:57:22] <dblosevn> cause im oviously doing something wrong lol
[19:01:27] <Foxhoundz> dblosevn: did you read their documentation?
[19:01:42] <dblosevn> ya doesnt really ssay how to do what im trying to do
[19:01:54] <dblosevn> my plugin works it just has weird behaviors at times
[19:04:35] <nesoi> danheberden : seems you were incorrect
[19:05:04] <nesoi> but maybe not because you were unfamiliar with pageinit :)
[19:05:06] <nesoi> pageinit fires everytime a page is loaded for the first time, jQM caches pages in the DOM/memory so when you navigate back from two.html to one.html, pageinit won't fire (it's already initialized)
[19:05:06] <nesoi> pageshow fires everytime a page is shown, this is what you need to be looking for when you navigate back from two.html to one.html
[19:07:15] <dblosevn> ya thoughs 2 have screwed me up in the past
[19:12:53] <melfy> hmmmmm
[19:13:03] <melfy> where is better documentation how to use XML within JQ?
[19:13:46] <melfy> this .find() function useless to me cause theres subchildren with same tag :'(
[19:14:29] <nesoi> hm. why wouldn't this be working? : $("#recipientsList").append('<a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" id="b-' + 'testy' +'>' + 'this is a kind of long name for a small button' +'</a>');
[19:14:40] <dblosevn> oh well they can just live with it, theres only one bug i cant work out
[19:14:40] <nesoi> recipientsList is the id of a div
[19:14:53] <dblosevn> and its super small
[19:16:03] <dblosevn> cant get it to remember the state of my plugin after switching to source mode then back to editor mode
[19:16:09] <melfy> nesoi: there an error? :P
[19:17:01] <nesoi> hmm.. ya think melfy? :)
[19:17:13] <dblosevn> so if you had the plugin enabled before switching to source mode it will be disabled when you switch back to editor mode
[19:17:16] <melfy> Foxhoundz: http://vzr.us/#1UdJg  =(
[19:17:18] <nesoi> any idea what I'm doing wrong? I can just create something like that?
[19:17:47] <melfy> sure can
[19:18:06] <melfy> nesoi: well it helps if you show your error
[19:18:52] <nesoi> melfy : there's no error message... code b4 and after that line executes but the button doesn't show up in the div
[19:19:09] <melfy> $('#skin').append('<div class="control" style="position:absolute;'+x+y+w+h+';"><div class="control-data" style="'+h+w+'">'+idbox+desc+'</div></div>');
[19:19:13] <melfy> mine works ;)~
[19:19:14] <dblosevn> nesoi: the only thing that could possibly go wrong there is `testy` is undefined
[19:19:26] <melfy> testy is a string
[19:19:37] <dblosevn> oh didnt see the quotes
[19:19:44] <melfy> yea his code all jacked :(
[19:19:53] <dblosevn> ill say
[19:20:00] <dblosevn> i assumed he was injecting a var
[19:20:06] <dblosevn> that makes 0 since
[19:20:20] <nesoi> I am, but I took it out for testing
[19:20:21] <melfy> well i'm sure he'll put actual ids after he can get his first link to show!
[19:20:27] <dblosevn> well one positive thing about it is ill bet he never has to obfusicate his code
[19:20:39] <dblosevn> :-D
[19:21:50] <dblosevn> dont you have to call refresh in jqm to get it to render new stuff?
[19:22:11] <dblosevn> like $('#skin').refresh or something
[19:22:47] <dblosevn> not sure of the actual code, but i dont think it will automatically interpret the data-roles and stuff
[19:23:09] <hagb4rd> hello everybody.. i'm looking for a good js editor, which allows me to throw some js-files into a project providing some syntax-highlighting and function-completing.. any suggestions are welcome
[19:23:37] <Foxhoundz> looking good
[19:23:40] <Foxhoundz> Meffen:
[19:23:48] <Foxhoundz> melfy*
[19:24:01] <nesoi> dblosevn : I did $("#recipientsList").trigger("create");
[19:24:41] <dblosevn> whats recipientsLists data-role?
[19:24:43] <initself> hagb4rd: vim
[19:25:01] <nesoi> dblosevn : no data-role
[19:25:06] <phonebook_> can i get some professional opinion about this? http://jsfiddle.net/MLRnB/ - it's no where close to done. add a couple tabs and drag them down. pay close attention to the fade on the tab. does it look like #$#@? *use chrome to look at it
[19:25:06] <hagb4rd> initself: are you kiddin?
[19:25:27] <initself> hagb4rd: that's what i use
[19:25:31] <uman> Hi
[19:25:41] <uman> What is the result of calling .val() on an empty set ?
[19:25:51] <dblosevn> undefined
[19:25:52] <nesoi> dblosevn : does it need a data-role?
[19:26:09] <nesoi> my test code is just #recipientsList").append('<a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" >' + 'this is a kind of long name for a small button' +'</a>'); $("#recipientsList").trigger("create");
[19:26:14] <nesoi> and still nothing is created
[19:26:37] <nesoi> am I leaving something out?
[19:26:42] <dblosevn> tryin to think because if it was data-role-listview then you could do $('#recie....').widget('listview').refresh()
[19:26:53] <dblosevn> but if it has no data-role i dont know how to do it
[19:27:19] <uman> dblosevn: were you responding to me? Thanks
[19:27:44] <dblosevn> sorry @ nesoi
[19:27:59] <dblosevn> uman: what you need?
[19:28:37] <dblosevn> oh
[19:28:47] <dblosevn> ya uman: it would be undefined
[19:29:05] <dsdeiz> hi all, how do i get the current visible elements in a jcarousel w/o using one of its callback options like itemFirstInCallback
[19:29:49] <dblosevn> uman: var value = $('#thisdoesntexist').val(); if (undefined === value) console.log('element not found');
[19:30:05] <nesoi> should I give it a data-role? if so, what would be a good one?
[19:30:23] <dblosevn> i dont even know what your doing so thats impossible to know
[19:31:01] <dblosevn> i just noticed the nodes your injecting had data-roles so i assumed there parent did too
[19:32:59] <uman> dblosevn: thanks
[19:49:48] <Es0teric> tw2113 -> http://jsfiddle.net/RG2Ke/5/show/ fixed
[19:50:08] <nesoi> dblosevn : I'm trying to put some buttons where there were none :)
[19:50:25] <nesoi> basically I'm trying to create a button for each selected contact from a contacts list
[19:50:39] <tw2113> go you
[19:51:11] <someprimetime> lok
[19:51:14] <someprimetime> s/k/l
[19:51:16] <someprimetime> LOL
[19:52:17] <nesoi> but the buttons are not appearing :(
[19:59:04] <dblosevn> have you posted a demo?
[19:59:13] <nesoi> I just figured it out
[19:59:20] <dblosevn> cool
[19:59:24] <nesoi> I had to do .parent.trigger('create')
[19:59:26] <dblosevn> sorry im in and out
[19:59:33] <nesoi> np thanks!
[20:00:04] <dblosevn> is create really what you should call?
[20:00:08] <dblosevn> id think refresh
[20:00:27] <dblosevn> refresh should destroy and create
[20:02:07] <dblosevn> which wont create issues if there were no buttons there orginally but doing it later may cause issues
[20:14:22] <dblosevn> someprimetime: its crazy everytime i see you in here i have thought it said sometimeprime i only now realized i had dyslexia or something lmao
[20:14:37] <someprimetime> lol
[20:15:03] <dblosevn> spell it backwards
[20:15:17] <someprimetime> i got this nickname when i was drunk and called my brother asking him for "some prime time" and he decided to email the google voice recording to me and it pretty much made no sense so i'm not even sure if the name is supposed to make any sense to begin with
[20:15:48] <dblosevn> lol
[20:15:52] <someprimetime> dblosevn: do you mess around with node?
[20:16:04] <dblosevn> mess around yes any good at it no
[20:16:12] <someprimetime> ah what about express?
[20:16:23] <dblosevn> dont think thats the frontend i was using
[20:16:34] <dblosevn> i was using the one that comes with node
[20:16:44] <someprimetime> ah yeah i'm using express as the middleware
[20:16:53] <dblosevn> never got it to work right
[20:17:03] <dblosevn> http://js.chosd.com
[20:17:07] <someprimetime> it's actually been really nice to work with
[20:17:12] <someprimetime> i'm converting a sit ei built with cakephp over to it
[20:17:17] <someprimetime> s/ ei/e
[20:17:37] <someprimetime> what is this?
[20:17:42] <dblosevn> i got it to load the inital template but thats all lol
[20:17:45] <someprimetime> *loading*
[20:17:50] <dblosevn> running on node
[20:17:51] <someprimetime> ah heh
[20:18:07] <dblosevn> at one point register and login worked but i broke it
[20:18:38] <someprimetime> ohhh that's like a fork of jsbin built with node?
[20:18:46] <dblosevn> this is another failed project i was working on at one point http://jquery.chosd.com/
[20:18:48] <dblosevn> ya
[20:19:17] <dblosevn> i couldnt get my bot to act right on the second one
[20:19:24] <someprimetime> haha nice
[20:19:57] <someprimetime> node has been really pleasant to work with
[20:19:57] <dblosevn> was going to make it post to the channel when a post was made eg ... someprimetime: dblosevn has posted a solution to your problem at http://....
[20:20:03] <someprimetime> i really like it
[20:20:12] <someprimetime> that'd be pretty cool
[20:20:25] <dblosevn> just havent had time to fix the bot
[20:20:58] <someprimetime> damn my internet connection is so slow atm
[20:21:01] <someprimetime> downloading walking dead so..
[20:21:24] <dblosevn> ya the bots off right now so its not working right
[20:21:50] <dblosevn> but the 2 boxes for your nick and the person your helpings nicks are autocomplete based on the current nick list in the channel
[20:22:43] <someprimetime> nice how do you grab that info?
[20:22:53] <dblosevn> i worte a php irc client
[20:23:45] <someprimetime> right on
[20:23:52] <dblosevn> when the bot is running he caches the nick list every 5 mins
[20:24:10] <dblosevn> while hes waiting to send post notifications
[20:24:33] <dblosevn> the bot runs in another thread form the site
[20:24:40] <dblosevn> deamonized php script
[20:25:07] <dblosevn> even integrated it with upstart with service monitoring
[20:25:08] <someprimetime> very cool
[20:25:26] <someprimetime> when are you going to finish it? :P
[20:26:21] <dblosevn> i should get some time next month i got a pretty huge project im behind on right now and really am looking for another dev to pick up my buddys slack on it
[20:26:53] <dblosevn> he bailed on me last week like 5 days before the deadline so im having to do all his work plus mine
[20:27:16] <someprimetime> oh jesus christ i know exactly what you are going through
[20:27:25] <someprimetime> i'm trying to finish a project i'm behind on for tomorrow
[20:27:29] <someprimetime> ugh
[20:27:55] <dblosevn> ya this is one ill get sued for if i keep pushing it out
[20:28:07] <someprimetime> well that's no good
[20:28:37] <nesoi> dblosevn : does refresh work in general or only with listviews?
[20:28:37] <dblosevn> i like the cash subbing for large corps but they got expensive attorneys to come after you when you dont deliver or screw up in general
[20:28:57] <dblosevn> nesoi: from my understanding it works on most all jquery widgets
[20:29:19] <dblosevn> as long as it was implemented
[20:29:44] <dblosevn> never really liked jQm though so i dont know much about it
[20:29:58] <dblosevn> did one project and called it quits
[20:30:18] <nesoi> hm. refresh created something but it was't styled as a button
[20:30:43] <dblosevn> maybe create is the right way to do it then
[20:32:31] <nesoi> hm... still working only in my test case, not for realz
[20:41:39] <nesoi> hm... so I have: console.log('creating ' + recipientsButtons); $("#recipientsList").append(recipientsButtons); $("#recipientsList").parent().trigger("create");
[20:45:43] <coldhead> i think jquery should be contract based
[20:46:09] <Otineb> lol
[20:47:41] <nesoi> and nothing happenes
[20:47:41] <nesoi> except that what's logged looks right
[20:47:41] <nesoi> but if I do just : $("#recipientsList").append('<a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" >' + 'this is a kind of long name for a small button' +'</a>'); $("#recipientsList").parent().trigger("create");
[20:47:41] <nesoi> it works
[20:47:41] <nesoi> wtf?
[20:47:41] <nesoi> what stupid thing am I missing?
[20:47:41] <nesoi> any idea dblosevn?
[20:48:05] <Otineb> wth, #PHP is invite only?
[20:48:26] <dblosevn> lol
[20:48:30] <dblosevn> ##php
[20:48:41] <dblosevn> im campin in there now
[20:49:06] <Stephen> nesoi: Still hunting the problem?
[20:49:31] <dblosevn> nesoi: i really need to see it to help
[20:49:55] <dblosevn> ive gave you about all i can without seeing the issue and being able to play with it
[20:50:11] <Stephen> My guess is recieptButtons has an object you're calling a method on which doesn't exist
[20:51:02] <Stephen> either that or #recipientsList is not a domElement which can take children
[20:57:32] <nesoi> yeah still hunting
[20:58:53] <nesoi> : ok here's the fragment https://gist.github.com/rlad/c206b6779fcd191a7d14
[20:59:00] <nesoi> Stephen : and dblosevn :)
[20:59:25] <nesoi> the commented out lines at the top work
[20:59:37] <nesoi> the console.logs show the expected stuff
[21:02:51] <nesoi> but the actual code doesn't do anything :)
[21:02:53] <nesoi> or :(
[21:03:00] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to have my form give feedback based off of input. However, my errors (notifications) are not appearing properly. Here is my script - http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/2hXbJ/2/
[21:05:31] <nesoi> is it possible that I can't do create on 2nd entry to the page?
[21:05:38] <radiantstatic> Any ideas as to why my "notifications" aren't appearing?
[21:05:57] <nesoi> cus the if is only true the 2nd time the page loads
[21:06:12] <nesoi> radiantstatic : I looked but don't have any suggestions
[21:09:05] <coldhead> i have an answer to your question radiantstatic BUT YOU HAVE FUCKED OFF SO YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IT
[21:10:15] <dblosevn> did he go?
[21:10:58] <dblosevn> oh well his problem was likely $(document).delegate("#m dont work at all in jquery latest without jquery.migrate
[21:11:48] <dblosevn> coldhead++
[21:12:14] <coldhead> i was gonna say his problem was this is not what he wishes it was
[21:12:19] <dblosevn> how waz ur sandwidch?
[21:12:23] <coldhead> but your explanation is fancier
[21:12:33] <coldhead> really good thanks db
[21:12:52] <dblosevn> so now all you gotta do is go clubbin
[21:13:25] <dblosevn> we were talkin bout 2 different peops lol
[21:13:35] <dblosevn> i was talkin bout nesoi
[21:13:41] <coldhead> he fucked off too
[21:13:51] <coldhead> young people these days, honestly
[21:13:56] <dblosevn> ya i know, i just noticed he finally posted some code lol
[21:14:11] <dblosevn> only took 3 hours
[21:15:06] <dblosevn> i swear though when a delegated function is removed they should not remove the function header and do something like alert('read tha docs')
[21:18:33] <coldhead> make it the user's problem, huh
[21:18:58] <coldhead> "i'm a 78 year old great grandmother and now i'm reading documentation at jack weary dot com"
[21:24:33] <abjorn> coldhead, brutha
[21:24:34] <abjorn> wut up
[21:24:41] <abjorn> also, all you other jqueriers, wuts up
[21:33:43] <coldhead> nothin good, abjsy
[21:42:27] <dblosevn> lol
[21:46:56] <johny__> Hi friends
[21:47:31] <johny__> When I make a list with ul & li tag, all lines are presented with borders but I do not want to show any borders at all. How am I supposed to do it?
[21:49:28] <johny__> Anybody here?
[21:54:49] <talktokets> johny__: Are you using tables in the page ?
[21:56:01] <jeremy-> I want to store some values to an object that are initialised inside a $.getJSON / $.each loop ..... for some reason the variable scope doesnt allow me to access the variables i store outside this loop, even when i define the object OUTSIDE this loop to begin with (i've tried storing it with both object.key = value and object[key] = value
[21:56:18] <jeremy-> Any pointers what im doing wrong?
[21:56:35] <johny__> no I am not using tables
[21:58:04] <talktokets> Then you may have to check the CSS file which you are using . In that it may be specified that borders will be displayed for UL and LI
[21:58:39] <jeremy-> oh, is it a race condition?
[21:59:00] <johny__> Actually I am using Blackberry 10 theme for jquery
[22:01:21] <johny__> i am tring to do it using !important, wait a second
[22:01:24] <jeremy-> nvm, as soon as i wrote down my problem I realised how to google it
[22:01:35] <jeremy-> race condition due to async call
[22:02:17] <johny__> it worked! thanks
[22:03:49] <talktokets> uGoMobi: Does jQuery provides inbuilt database functionality?
[22:04:41] <coldhead> no
[22:04:48] <Cork> talktokets: uh, jquery is for client side, the only database you have there is indexDB
[22:05:13] <coldhead> thank god for Cork "localstorage" McCorkson
[22:05:28] <Cork> coldhead: ?
[22:05:45] <Cork> localStorage, is a key storage, not a database
[22:05:55] <talktokets> ok fine
[22:06:29] <coldhead> don't question me, Mr McCorkson
[22:06:39] <tw2113> question everything
[22:06:44] <tw2113> especially coldhead
[22:06:56] <jeremy-> key/value is still a database, berkeley?
[22:06:59] <Cork> coldhead: are you in a bad mood today or something?
[22:07:28] <Cork> jeremy-: it can't store multiple related values at all
[22:07:30] <djQuery> coldhead, yeah localstorage is a lot easier than indexdb
[22:07:34] <Cork> unless you use something like json
[22:07:37] <djQuery> ?indexdb shim
[22:07:46] <Cork> sure, and a lot slower
[22:07:51] <coldhead> i am always in a bad mood
[22:08:06] <tw2113> Cork, you're finally figuring out the "cold" in coldhead ?
[22:08:12] <Cork> :)
[22:08:20] <coldhead> next we move to the "head" part
[22:08:23] <coldhead> it's not what you think
[22:08:29] <Cork> <_<'
[22:08:31] <tw2113> coldhead, is a very giving man
[22:09:01] <jeremy-> you mean its not a relational database then
[22:09:02] <tw2113> he just gives and gives and gives all day long
[22:09:28] <jeremy-> nosql is gaining steam, relational isnt everything anymore
[22:09:29] <Cork> jeremy-: you don't have columns in any form
[22:09:38] <Cork> or tables for that matter
[22:09:49] <Cork> you have a key and a value
[22:09:51] <jeremy-> So you are saying berkeley isnt a database :D
[22:09:54] <jeremy-> okay
[22:10:07] <Cork> not from my point of view
[22:10:50] <coldhead> the only "database" as far as i'm concerned is a kid's fort made out of old phonebooks
[22:10:54] <Cork> and the fact that the browser has to synchronously load the entire store for the page before running its javascript is even worse
[22:11:09] <Cork> (every time you load any page from the site)
[22:11:23] <jeremy-> I was thinking about using html5 local storage if this is where we are going back to
[22:11:29] <jeremy-> is this one of the caveats for it?
[22:11:47] <Cork> if you put a lot of data in it all your pages will suffer; yes
[22:12:01] <jeremy-> For instance, I have a datatables list, i display 100-500 results per page
[22:12:15] <jeremy-> I want a quick way a user can hide records, or as you scroll down the page, it marks where you are up to on the page
[22:12:19] <Cork> the number of posts doesn't matter that much as the size of the data
[22:12:19] <jeremy-> its going to accrue a bit of data
[22:12:27] <jeremy-> seems better than ajax calls though
[22:12:34] <jeremy-> i guess all i can do is benchtest
[22:12:50] <talktokets> PhoneGap is one option for local storage
[22:12:51] <jeremy-> i see
[22:12:54] <Cork> the fact is that the browser has to wait for disk io to load the entire database into ram BEFORE it can render the page
[22:13:10] <jeremy-> i see, interesting thanks
[22:13:16] <Cork> cause the localStorage api is syncronus
[22:13:30] <coldhead> synchronous*
[22:13:33] <Cork> and thats why indexDB is better, as its api is async
[22:13:46] <Cork> so the browser can load the data when you request it instead
[22:14:03] <Cork> so all pages that don't use it won't suffer from the load time
[22:14:59] <Cork> jeremy-: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/there-is-no-simple-solution-for-local-storage/
[22:15:19] <Cork> they made a big "user localStorage for image caching!"
[22:15:32] <Cork> and then got serous problems
[22:15:40] <Cork> and that page is from what they found :)
[22:16:05] <tw2113> woo codepo8
[22:19:56] <jeremy-> Theres some interesting discussion in the comments section you linked me
[22:20:16] <jeremy-> oh well, all i can do is pick one and try
[22:21:14] <Cork> jeremy-: i suggest is to use a lib that uses indexedDB if it exists
[22:21:26] <jeremy-> yeh, theres even a jquery library
[22:21:26] <Cork> fallsback to localStorage if it doesn't
[22:21:31] <jeremy-> to help with the integration between different platforms
[22:21:38] <Cork> and even cookie as a last option
[22:22:00] <coldhead> i suggest not bothering to make sites because no one uses sites other than facebook anymore anyway
[22:22:04] <Cork> though that last one is a terrible option, even worse then localStorage
[22:22:32] * tw2113 knows about coldhead's websites
[22:22:51] <Cork> as cookies is sent in every request, that could force each request to be multi packages, just for the cache storage >_>
[22:24:11] <jeremy-> this whole discussion tempts me to see whether just using cached json would be faster, i'll have a play
[22:25:36] <coldhead> good luck jez!
[22:26:42] <Cork> jeremy-: a nice nginx frontend solves a lot of the problem
[22:26:59] <Cork> though the dataplan strain might be a problem
[22:27:06] <jeremy-> Yeh, well my sysadmin isnt so good so I just use CDN at the moment
[22:27:10] <Cork> (for user on a mobile connection plan)
[22:27:13] <jeremy-> I want to learn that kind stuff eventually
[22:28:20] <jeremy-> Id love to learn how to do those installations using nginx AND varnish
[22:28:25] <jeremy-> As an alternative to my CDN's
[22:40:57] <coldhead> shoot me first
[23:12:04] <lanken> I'm hitting what should be a simple problem, but I can't seem to google up the answer.
[23:12:35] <lanken> I have an array of elements which I have indexed using HTML data-X attributes
[23:12:56] <lanken> with these elements, it's very easy to select them if I know the value of the data- attribute
[23:13:19] <lanken> I simply do $('div[data-X="blah"]') and jquery chooses the right noe
[23:13:28] <lanken> s/noe/one/
[23:14:18] <lanken> now, jquery also provides $.data as a way of attaching metadata, and I believe it's correct to use jquery's .data whenever possible
[23:14:23] <limpc> im trying to select a button which contains the class 'uiButton' (but may contain other classes).  Forgot what the selector is for that? something like button [class=*uiButton] ?
[23:14:52] <lanken> but I don't know how to compose a jQuery selector that selects based on jQuery's .data attribute.
[23:15:14] <lanken> limpc: $("button.uiButton")
[23:15:29] <limpc> i tried that but i get no hits
[23:15:55] <lanken> is the button <button class="uiButton">?
[23:16:11] <limpc> it has more than 1 class but yes
[23:16:17] <lanken> check uppercase-lowercase
[23:16:23] <limpc> <button icon-type="ui-icon-closethick" albumid="13" class="uibutton deleteAlbum ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only" role="button" aria-disabled="false"><span class="ui-button-text"></span></button>
[23:16:48] <lanken> yeah, you need to do "button.uibutton"
[23:16:52] <lanken> it's all lowercase in your HTML
[23:16:56] <sanket> I have used sortable and I want to use collapse also. How can I use it?
[23:17:25] <limpc> lanken: damn. idk why i didnt notice that. thanks
[23:18:16] <lanken> limpc: one time I lost like 30 minutes over "30px" vs "30 px" in a css definition...
[23:18:31] <lanken> limpc: totally logical in retrospect
[23:19:37] <xdjuj> lanken did you lost 30min or 30 min ? :D
[23:19:47] <lanken> X_X
[23:20:27] <lanken> so, can anyone tell me how to filter a jquery object by key-values assigned using $.data?
[23:20:49] <limpc> thats a bit beyond me sorry
[23:20:58] <limpc> havent played with that yet
[23:23:09] <fRAiLtY-> How to make this NOT reset on refresh, just continue counting up? http://jsfiddle.net/9mCp8/11/
[23:23:36] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: haven't looked at it, but how are you going to try to preserve a variable across a user refreshing the page?
[23:23:50] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: wouldn't you need to store something server-side, or in a cookie?
[23:26:42] <sanket> uGoMobi : I have used sortable and I want to use collapse also. How can I use it?
[23:33:03] <coldhead> right, fuck this
[23:35:05] <dblosevn> lanken: explain filter in your context
[23:35:30] <dblosevn> ya cold your a little colder then normal tonight that time of the month?
[23:35:34] <fRAiLtY-> For example, Google quota, counts up to a number, doesn't reset,that's what I'm trying to achieve
[23:36:05] <dblosevn> :-)
[23:37:36] <lanken> dblosevn: say I've got five divs, and on each dive I run $(this).data('chars', $this.html().length )
[23:37:59] <dblosevn> ok
[23:38:14] <dblosevn> now what do you want to filter?
[23:38:19] <lanken> dblosevn: now I want to hide() the ones where 'chars' > 10
[23:38:28] <lanken> dblosevn: or even where chars = 10
[23:38:33] <dblosevn> good luck with that
[23:38:43] <dblosevn> not going to find a one liner for that
[23:39:17] <dblosevn> do these divs have a class or something to indtify them with
[23:39:22] <lanken> dblosevn: but there *is* a one-liner if I store the data as a string via .attr('data-chars', '10')
[23:39:36] <dblosevn> ya
[23:39:42] <dblosevn> but you have to know the value
[23:39:52] <lanken> dblosevn: if I use .attr, I can find them via "div[data-chars='10']"
[23:40:05] <lanken> dblosevn: ok, so is it the same with .data as with .attr?
[23:40:16] <dblosevn> i could select that with $('div["data-chars="10"]').hide()
[23:40:35] <lanken> dblosevn: but that's the code for when the data value is stored with HTML5 data- attributes
[23:40:38] <dblosevn> but you cant do $('div["data-chars<="10"]')
[23:40:55] <lanken> dblosevn: I want to use jquery .data instead, because it's type-protected
[23:41:05] <dblosevn> um... jquery uses thoughs too
[23:41:48] <lanken> dblosevn: what if I want to store an array, like .data('chars', [2,3])
[23:42:10] <dblosevn> i can do... $(this).data('animal', 'cat'); then imediately after do $this = $('div[data-animal="cat"]');
[23:42:35] <dblosevn> and it would select that node
[23:43:05] <dblosevn> that logic doesnt work if you dont know the values though
[23:43:12] <dblosevn> i think what you want is .map
[23:43:25] <dblosevn> and a class
[23:43:35] <dblosevn> or .grep
[23:44:51] <lanken> dblosevn: thanks for trying. What I was hoping was that there would be a built-in way of referring to values stored via jQuery's .data
[23:45:24] <lanken> dblosevn: from what you're saying, you're only aware of a way of handling "data-" HTML5 attributes, which is what I already know how to do.
[23:47:50] <Cork> lanken: $().data will give you an object, thats it
[23:48:14] <Cork> data is just a function to access an object of objects stored internally in jquery
[23:48:34] <eni> if(typeof $room_li !== 'undefined'){
[23:48:47] <eni> is the $ in front of room_li jquery ?
[23:49:52] <lanken> Cork: ok, so if I need to "select" objects by their .data(), I should really just do $('div').each ( function() { if ($this.data() blah blah ....) {stuff;} } )
[23:50:20] <Cork> $(this).data('my-chas').myKey
[23:50:26] <Cork> works fine too
[23:50:29] <dblosevn> $("[data-chars]").grep(function () { parseInt($(this).data('chars')) <= 10});
[23:50:46] <lanken> Cork: oh, it wouldn't be ['myKey'] ?
[23:50:46] <dblosevn> ** $("[data-chars]").grep(function () { return (parseInt($(this).data('chars')) <= 10)});
[23:51:07] <dblosevn> .hide();
[23:51:08] <Cork> lanken: .myKey is another way of writing ['myKey']
[23:51:18] <lanken> nice.
[23:51:20] <Cork> they are basally the same
[23:51:44] <Cork> the exception is that ['my Key'] is valid while .my Key isn't
[23:51:51] <lanken> dblosevn: jquery has grep???
[23:51:56] <dblosevn> ya sort of
[23:52:04] <dblosevn> your function returns true or false
[23:52:14] <dblosevn> true to be included false not to be
[23:52:16] <Cork> its just a form of each
[23:52:39] <dblosevn> eg in this case it would return true if > 10
[23:52:46] <dblosevn> false
[23:53:06] <lanken> Cork: so grep is like each but you throw a Boolean function into the ()
[23:53:07] <dblosevn> so do that.hide(); and your done
[23:53:08] <Cork> what is it you want to look for?
[23:53:15] <Cork> lanken: yes
[23:53:16] <lanken> dblosevn: nice.
[23:53:24] <lanken> awesome.
[23:53:30] <Cork> dblosevn: your sure you don't mean to use filter there?
[23:53:44] <Cork> $("[data-chars]").filter(function () { return (parseInt($(this).data('chars')) <= 10)}).hide(); ?
[23:53:45] <fRAiLtY-> lanken:  I see what you're saying, the other option would be to not start from 0? Gives the same impression http://jsfiddle.net/9mCp8/11/ or
[23:54:27] <dblosevn> that would work too thought thats essentially what grep did
[23:55:05] <dblosevn> crap grep is for arrays not dom objects
[23:55:08] <Cork> dblosevn: and $().grep doesn't exist
[23:55:10] <Cork> ya
[23:55:13] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: I'm not the most expert in javascript, but my understanding is that javascript is meant to start from scratch when you reload the page, yeah.
[23:55:14] <dblosevn> cork++
[23:55:19] <Cork> its $.grep($('selector'))
[23:55:48] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: look into placing a cookie on closing the page
[23:55:50] <fRAiLtY-> But surely it can be told to start from a different number, anyone?
[23:55:58] <dblosevn> $.grep(myarr, funcition() {return true;});
[23:56:24] <dblosevn> so ya use .filter
[23:57:09] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you would have to modify the init function
[23:57:16] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: what is the different, non-zero number based on?
[23:57:22] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it statically creates 0 as the number
[23:57:30] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  It does, what line?
[23:57:41] <Cork> line 69 - 76
[23:57:44] <dblosevn> so its not even a timestamp
[23:57:52] <dblosevn> nice thats the only way that works
[23:58:06] <lanken> fRAiLtY-: if you're trying to have it start from where it left off, try placing a cookie and updating it with each tick
[23:58:23] <dblosevn> or save a timestamp to a cookie and on page load calc the number of seconds elapsed between the last pageload and now then throw that into your init
[23:58:25] <fRAiLtY-> Sounds messy :x
[23:58:57] <dblosevn> write the cookie once no reason to go all crazy on tick
[23:59:41] <dblosevn> $.cookie('firstopen', new Date().toString());
