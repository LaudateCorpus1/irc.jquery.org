[00:20:41] <trailertrash> Hey everyone, how do you resize an iframe on ready and resize subtracting the height of the header and menu? $(document).ready(function() {$(".myiframe").css("height", $(".wrap").height());});
[01:29:25] <spoonUltra> Is it stupid to include two document scroll functions in the same document?
[01:29:30] <spoonUltra> in the same file*
[02:11:23] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: combine them
[02:11:35] <spoonUltra> hmm
[02:47:41] <HowardwLo> hey gang! is this a good way to stop a link navigation to track something, then continue with link navigation? https://dpaste.de/xQM2
[02:49:33] <Uhkis> HowardwLo: remove the return false and you're good to go
[02:49:57] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: cheerios! just so I know, how/when should i use return false?
[02:50:20] <Uhkis> return false there is the same as e.preventDefault() afaik
[02:51:30] <Uhkis> HowardwLo: some more info on the subject http://stackoverflow.com/a/1357151
[02:51:42] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: would your answer change if my “tracking” part contains an ajax request? I’m not seeing it hitting my servers :(
[02:52:32] <Uhkis> HowardwLo: you have to do the window.location in the ajax requests done handler
[02:52:47] <Uhkis> otherwise it will run it async and ajax probably never completes
[02:53:39] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: ah okie doke
[02:54:07] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: is there a way to make it navigate regardless of success/fail of the ajax?
[02:54:44] <Uhkis> HowardwLo: use .always() then
[02:56:50] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: ah ok. never heard of that one :D. according to the docs, my code should be something like $.ajax({…..}).always(); ?
[02:57:44] <arc_> always is a callback just like done
[02:57:59] <Uhkis> HowardwLo: or you can setup the complete in the settings object
[02:58:43] <Uhkis> arc_: but done requires the call to be successful
[02:58:48] <arc_> ya
[02:58:59] <arc_> i was just saying if he knows how to use done, he knows how to use always
[03:00:37] <Uhkis> ah
[03:04:39] <HowardwLo> Uhkis: by settings object, you are talking about this right? https://dpaste.de/ssu4

[04:48:20] <shai43> Hello, need help :) I am using .text() command to get into variable some iframe content (I use .text() so I will get just text without HTML) and its working good. now I want to copy the variable content into the clipboard I found there is command: document.execCommand('copy'); but how I use it with variable content?
[04:48:48] <shai43> I use the next command to get the iframe content: 			var iframecontent = $("#template").contents().find("html").text();
[05:04:49] <profsimm> Hi folks, I want to stopPropagation() on a button inside a table row, so when the button is clicked, the row doesn't get a click event. The problem is I must use delegated events, so by the time one runs, it has already propagated. And... unfortunately, somehow the row handler runs first, despite I add it second. Thoughts?
[05:41:13] <haroldjfks> hello :-)
[05:41:47] <haroldjfks> well... if inside an a with class clip (a.clip) there's not an img... ?
[05:43:58] <shoky> ..what?
[05:44:27] <haroldjfks> shoky: I need to evaluate if inside an a.clip an img tag is there or not...
[05:44:44] <shoky> you can check  .find('img').length
[05:46:22] <haroldjfks> if ( ('a.clip').find('img').length ) {...} is that syntax correct?
[05:46:46] <shoky> what is  ('a.clip')  ?
[05:46:54] <shoky> that's just the string 'a.clip' .
[05:47:02] <haroldjfks> a href with class clip
[05:47:14] <shoky> no, it's a string.   .find() works on jquery objects
[05:47:28] <shoky> and you should check if the length is > 0  for example
[05:50:03] <haroldjfks> if ( $('a.clip').find('img').length > 0 ) {...} ?
[05:50:25] <shoky> yep
[05:51:30] <Uhkis> why check for > 0? works the same without it
[05:51:37] <shoky> more readable with it
[05:51:58] <haroldjfks> thanks
[05:52:12] <Uhkis> i disagree
[05:52:21] <shoky> then you're wrong :)
[05:54:17] <Uhkis> quick read without the > 0 is read as "is it there" while the > makes you read more to see if theres other than 0 after it
[05:54:30] <profsimm> Hi folks, I want to stopPropagation() on a button inside a table row, so when the button is clicked, the row doesn't get a click event.

[05:54:33] <shoky> quick read without the > 0  is read as "is it .lenth"
[05:54:35] <shoky> .length
[05:54:48] <shoky> not is it there
[05:54:57] <shoky> if it was  .exists()  or something, then yeah
[05:55:08] <shoky> but .length?  that's not a condition, sorry
[05:57:58] <shoky> profsimm: make a jsfiddle
[06:29:50] <haroldjfks> I'm not able to select the IMGs inside the a.clip ... the structure is div > div > ul > li > a > span > img
[06:30:50] <haroldjfks> i need to hide something where the img is NOT there....
[06:31:48] <haroldjfks> I know that the a class is a.clip but I'm not able to do it
[06:31:57] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[06:34:34] <haroldjfks> seems that it works on jsfiddle but doesn't work on the page? lol
[06:34:58] <shoky> maybe you didnt put your code in  $(document).ready ?
[06:35:20] <shoky> jsfidddle does that for you by default
[06:37:27] <haroldjfks> no, it doesn't work at all lol
[06:38:01] <haroldjfks> it's here https://jsfiddle.net/wsr41vxe/1/
[06:39:25] <shoky> might want to include jquery
[06:42:38] <tuskkk___> Hello
[06:43:12] <tuskkk___> https://bpaste.net/show/930df15700ca  missing ) after argument list
[06:43:23] <tuskkk___> what's wrong with it?
[06:43:45] <shoky> tuskkk___: it's so short, you can find the problem yourself, i'm sure
[06:43:52] <haroldjfks> ops, here I called the jquery into external https://jsfiddle.net/wsr41vxe/3/
[06:44:01] <haroldjfks> but it doesn't work
[06:44:08] <haroldjfks> it should hide the entire div
[06:44:43] <tuskkk___> shoky: no :( woulnt have posted here if I did.
[06:44:54] <shoky> haroldjfks that still doesn't include jquery. you can include it by clicking where it says JAVASCRIPT and choosing jquery there.  but
[06:45:04] <shoky> tuskkk___:  try again, please
[06:45:27] <shoky> tuskkk___: just look at the whole thing,  character by character.. until you find what you're missing
[06:46:41] <tuskkk___> shoky: even this doesnt work, $('#flashWidget').prepend("<div class='flash'><div class='"+r.status+"''>'"r.message"'</div></div>");
[06:47:00] <shoky> tuskkk___:  stop talking, just look at that line, break it down
[06:47:22] <shoky> use spaces, don'tattacheverythinglikethis
[06:47:41] <tuskkk___> ok, let me try
[06:47:54] <tuskkk___> the rule is to get that all as string right?
[06:48:20] <shoky> the rule is to write valid javascript ;p  that includes many rules ;p
[06:48:20] <haroldjfks> shoky: i can't find what you say...
[06:48:40] <shoky> haroldjfks:  in the middle of the jsfiddle screen it says JAVASCRIPT with a gear icon next to it
[06:48:58] <shoky> jsfiddle should really go back to the old ui :\
[06:51:12] <haroldjfks> it seems that it works now https://jsfiddle.net/wsr41vxe/5/
[06:51:34] <haroldjfks> as you can see now there is one image, if you replace that img tag with NOTHING it works... can you confirm?
[06:52:31] <shoky> you need me to confirm that?
[06:53:09] <haroldjfks> shoky: if you want :-D lol
[06:53:47] <shoky> i want to help, if help is needed :)  if it's not needed i'd rather go back to staring at the wall :D
[06:58:33] <tuskkk___> shoky: got it, so silly of me, thanks.
[07:00:04] <haroldjfks> ahah it works there but doesn't work on my page... there are images but it hides anyway...
[07:45:15] <Felishia> help
[07:45:20] <Felishia> chaining in jquery is not working
[07:45:36] <Felishia> in ajax requestz
[07:46:47] <Xatenev> Felishia: shit
[07:47:43] <Xatenev> Felishia: Is that all or are you asking a real question?
[07:48:03] <Felishia> :3
[07:48:28] <Demonen> Define "not working"?
[07:48:28] <Felishia> well I mean I have a $.ajax request and when I .done() it I return another ajax request inside the done
[07:49:28] <Felishia> https://gist.github.com/onzag/f94164591202137f7152
[07:49:44] <Felishia> the ajax requests are happening and are not triggering the .fail part
[07:49:55] <Felishia> instead the next .done happens
[07:50:08] <Felishia> I thought this was like a promise
[07:54:54] <Demonen> You are appending the .done() to the already done request. AFAIK, you have to .done() on the relevant $.ajax()
[08:14:20] <tuskkk___> how do we fire an event when something gets hidden?
[08:14:59] <greg_f> hello
[08:15:33] <islalobo> Hello, I got a lot of awesome help with this already but it still needs to be refined. Here is my template and jquery and I'm looking for a way to only show the template if the conditions from the jquery are met. What's happening now is the attributes are added to each element when the conditions are met, but if they aren't an empty template (including image) are shown.
[08:20:25] <greg_f> I asked yesterday but couldn't solve an issue. I have a form to upload file to S3 bucket. It hasn't redirect that's why aws server returns 204 http status. My form I submit with form.get(0).submit(function(e) { alert('submit', e) }) but I don't see alert. Why it can be?
[08:26:04] <shoky> greg_f: do you want to submit the form, or add a submit event handler?   .get(0) gets you the raw dom element,  you can't call jquery functions on it like .submit(function..)
[08:26:50] <shoky> greg_f: also don't use alerts,  use console.log.  alert doesn't accept multiple params
[08:27:08] <shoky> or object params
[08:31:24] <greg_f> shoky: so I need smt $(form).submit(...?
[08:31:51] <shoky> greg_f: depends what `form` is, and what you want to do
[08:32:20] <greg_f> shoky: var form = $("#update-splash-form");
[08:32:35] <shoky> then you don't need $() around `form`
[08:32:44] <shoky> still don't know what you want to do
[08:33:47] <greg_f> shoky: I want to submit form and catch success upload
[08:35:13] <shoky> you can submit with  .submit();  catching success upload doesn't really have to do with a submit event, depends how you're doing the upload, probably depends on the serverside
[08:36:47] <greg_f> shoky: ok, thank you
[09:09:33] <hellyeah> i solved the problem with a way but thats not ideal way it seems
[09:20:02] <haroldjfks> I understood why my code doesn't work... i load a youtube video into iframe... that iframe is not visible in page source, so how to access the youtube iframe elements by jquery? thanks
[09:20:37] <taplar> page source only shows what the page originally was
[09:20:41] <taplar> not what is in the dom
[09:21:22] <haroldjfks> so, why I'm not able to select an id ? it works on jfiddle, doesn't work on the page
[09:21:52] <taplar> console.log($(selector).length);
[09:21:56] <taplar> if it's 0, it's not in the dom
[09:22:26] <taplar> or your selector is incorrect
[09:23:33] <haroldjfks> is it a problem if the id I want to hide is into a <section... tag ?
[09:23:56] <taplar> i don't see why it would
[09:24:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  i solved the case
[09:24:15] <taplar> cool
[09:24:21] <hellyeah> but it is not ideal solution may be
[09:24:27] <hellyeah> can you give me some ideas?
[09:24:40] <taplar> maybe
[09:24:44] <hellyeah> line 297-301 http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/27/
[09:25:19] <haroldjfks> console.log($(#player-unavailable).length); returns unexpected token ILLEGAL... why?
[09:25:31] <hellyeah> i try stepMonths option that doesnt give me what i want
[09:25:47] <taplar> you need to put quotes around your selector
[09:25:47] <hellyeah> $player-unavailable is a variable?
[09:25:55] <haroldjfks> is it an id
[09:26:11] <hellyeah> you cannot use like that
[09:26:23] <hellyeah> $('..')
[09:26:31] <hellyeah> or
[09:26:40] <hellyeah> $('...).prop('id')
[09:26:43] <hellyeah> if you want id
[09:26:53] <taplar> hellyeah: why are you using moment?
[09:27:04] <hellyeah> well
[09:27:26] <hellyeah> x.setDate(x.getDate() + 1) give me milisecond
[09:27:36] <hellyeah> when i use with moment i can get this as date
[09:27:55] <Delegater> Hey guys
[09:27:59] <hellyeah> x.setDate(x.getDate()) give me milisecond
[09:28:07] <haroldjfks> ok, so console.log($('#player-unavailable').length); is correct and returns 0 ... but I see that on console...so why it doesn't find that id on the dom?
[09:28:13] <Delegater> jQuery("body").on("click", ".article", function(event) { });
[09:28:26] <Delegater> Is there any way to bind this globally without specifcying <body>?
[09:28:30] <taplar> haroldjfks: it's not in the dom then
[09:28:32] <Delegater> Some websites miss <body> tag...
[09:28:46] <taplar> Delegater: all documents have a body
[09:29:02] <Delegater> taplar: some crappy Blogger sites doesn't have them
[09:29:06] <hellyeah> $('button').on('click', function(event) { }); Delegater
[09:29:07] <taplar> example?
[09:29:30] <Delegater> let me check
[09:29:30] <hellyeah> Delegater:  you use parent selector for delegation
[09:29:56] <haroldjfks> taplar: <div id="player-unavailable" class="ytp-error"><div id="unavailable-submessage" class="ytp-error-content"></div></div>
[09:29:57] * hellyeah taplar  will correct me if i am wrong :p
[09:30:04] <haroldjfks> I see that lol
[09:30:37] <hellyeah> you write it with #
[09:30:49] <hellyeah> but there is no # character
[09:30:55] <hellyeah> may be your selector is wrong
[09:30:56] <taplar> you see that where?
[09:31:21] <haroldjfks> I'm on Chrome > Elements
[09:31:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  <haroldjfks> ok, so console.log($('#player-unavailable').length);
[09:32:01] <taplar> ok, so that's the inspecting, not the page source, :P
[09:32:22] <taplar> hmm, your lookup should find it then from what i can tell
[09:32:26] <haroldjfks> taplar: you said that page source is irrelevant... and the dom counts
[09:32:47] <taplar> page source and the developer tools inspection is not the same
[09:33:02] <taplar> developer tools reflect the dom
[09:33:19] <taplar> page source is what the html was returned from the http request originally
[09:33:27] <haroldjfks> so, aren't Elements the elements inside the dom?
[09:33:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  any suggestion :XD
[09:33:31] <taplar> yes
[09:33:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:33:56] <hellyeah> i have an idea
[09:33:57] <taplar> hellyeah: so what was the problem you were trying to solve again?
[09:34:18] <haroldjfks> I can't understand... is a problem if those elements are inside an iframe?
[09:34:22] <taplar> haroldjfks: can you show an example of this?  that selector should work
[09:34:23] <taplar> oh
[09:34:25] <taplar> lol
[09:34:27] <taplar> yes
[09:34:41] <taplar> yeah, selectors only work on the main page
[09:34:53] <taplar> is the source in the iframe from the same domain?
[09:35:01] <haroldjfks> is from youtube
[09:35:06] <taplar> so cross domain then
[09:35:20] <taplar> you can't access any of that then with javascript
[09:35:53] <taplar> if it was same domain you could drill into it and use selectors
[09:36:49] <haroldjfks> it's a real issue, then..
[09:36:57] <taplar> nope, it's a security feature
[09:37:22] * hellyeah stands for a reason
[09:37:32] <haroldjfks> but I want to hide a div if the player is unavailable... is there a way to do it?
[09:38:27] <taplar> not sure.  guess it depends on what you mean by it's unavailable
[09:38:43] <taplar> not sure if you can get information from the iframe abou that sort of thing
[09:38:59] <taplar> maybe something in the youtube api, but i'm not familiar
[09:39:49] <haroldjfks> I directly tried into the js script with if (json.pageInfo.totalResults == 0) { alert("no video"); } but it doesn't work
[09:40:33] <hellyeah> good
[09:40:48] <taplar> ?
[09:40:53] <hellyeah> better way to do it was  $(this).datepicker( "option", "defaultDate", $date);
[09:40:59] <hellyeah> i dont need moment
[09:41:07] <hellyeah> but it can be another alternative tho
[09:41:24] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/28/ line 302
[09:41:41] <hellyeah> :)
[09:41:54] <Someone_Else> Does anyone here have experience with backstretch.js?
[09:42:10] <taplar> hellyeah: you'd want to add a day though, right?
[09:42:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:42:48] <hellyeah> actually for example
[09:42:55] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! any canonical definitive text on inheriting JQ plugins ? tried to google, only to find zillions of plain JS inheritance 'class' imitators
[09:42:56] <hellyeah> you select march 16 to June 5
[09:43:07] <haroldjfks> ok ok..I did it lol I wrote it in the wrong place lol
[09:43:09] <hellyeah> when you create next datepicker it will show june 6
[09:43:13] <haroldjfks> how to write from external js into a div on the page, please?
[09:43:16] <Serg_Penguin> i want plugins what load and render self and register events, much like Angular directives
[09:43:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you understand?
[09:43:39] <Serg_Penguin> i have one working, but i need many and no copy-paste
[09:43:44] <taplar> hellyeah: yep
[09:43:56] <taplar> haroldjfks: what do you mean?
[09:43:56] <hellyeah> now it worked
[09:44:33] <hellyeah> but taplar  numberofMonth and default date both option seems usable for some cases
[09:44:37] <haroldjfks> eg. I have on the page <div id="something"></div> ...from the external .js I want to write one into that div, so it becomes <div id="something">one</div>
[09:45:00] <taplar> $('#something').append('one') or .text('one')
[09:45:31] <haroldjfks> from the external .js ... not in the page source
[09:45:45] <haroldjfks> I don't mean jquery...
[09:45:46] <hellyeah> val('one')
[09:46:00] <taplar> val is for inputs
[09:46:22] <taplar> haroldjfks: so with plain js then?  i'm not sure what your asking
[09:46:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:47:02] <hellyeah> .text() is for dropdown?
[09:47:17] <taplar> text() goes inbetween the tags
[09:47:26] <taplar> val() sets the value property
[09:47:41] <taplar> text() is like html() but it escapes some characters
[09:48:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:48:29] <hellyeah> which characters? like '
[09:48:37] <granden> Hi, I got this small snippet, http://pastebin.com/tW9aZhQ6 that I have to prevent a form from being submited if not passing without adding any text to errorString
[09:48:45] <taplar> characters that would cause the text to render as html
[09:48:54] <hellyeah> ic
[09:48:56] <granden> But in Internet Explorer it wont work at all, nothing is submitted
[09:49:04] <hellyeah> ie sucks
[09:49:07] <haroldjfks> ok, it was document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "new content"; ;-)
[09:49:09] <hellyeah> which version
[09:49:17] <granden> hellyeah: IE 11
[09:49:23] <hellyeah> sucks again
[09:49:29] <taplar> granden: what version of jquery are you using?
[09:49:33] <granden> Yeah it does, but I can't help it :)
[09:49:36] <hellyeah> haroldjfks:  there is textContent method also check this out
[09:49:41] <granden> taplar: 2.0.3 I belive have to check
[09:50:04] <taplar> granden: give 1.X and try and see if anything changes
[09:50:11] <hellyeah> 1.9
[09:50:16] <hellyeah> 1.9.1
[09:52:23] <taplar> granden: also your using jquery so really you could be using the $() lookup instead of all those document.getElementById calls
[09:53:13] <taplar> if all your using jquery is for the binding, then you should really look into the vanilla addEventListener method
[09:53:22] <taplar> ##javascript could tell you more about that
[09:55:35] <taplar> your also repeating 'document.getElementById("orgno2")' a lot
[09:55:38] <taplar> cache it and reuse it
[09:56:10] <hellyeah> i am not sure what is my benefit from caching selector?
[09:56:16] <hellyeah> is there any source i can read
[09:56:28] <decx> hen you cache you create a direct reference to an element
[09:56:29] <taplar> why do the same thing over and over?
[09:56:45] <decx> when you do getelement or whatever you check the dom
[09:56:55] <hellyeah> taplar:  yeah i agree i just wonder is there any article that examine this issue
[09:57:16] <hellyeah> just cariosity
[09:57:31] <taplar> i'm sure theres one google could find you.
[09:57:45] <taplar> but as decx was starting to say, your hitting the dom
[09:57:52] <taplar> and if your using jquery your going through sizzle
[09:58:02] <taplar> so there's a lot of work going on
[09:58:02] <shoky> hellyeah: calling some function is more expensive than not calling it. even if this wasn't related to the DOM
[09:58:04] <hellyeah> jquery my have ! and >> feature as javascript channel has it
[09:58:42] <hellyeah> !jQuery clone() for example
[09:58:52] <hellyeah> that will print official clone page
[09:59:05] <shoky> ?botsnack
[09:59:05] <b-ot> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[09:59:08] <hellyeah> >> like var i = 5; console.log(i
[09:59:11] <hellyeah> >> like var i = 5; console.log(i)
[09:59:13] <Cork> `js echo("hello");
[09:59:15] <hellyeah> smt like that
[09:59:18] <shoky> that's about the extent of this channel's bot, currently
[09:59:22] <hellyeah> this is really handy feature
[09:59:23] <Cork> i think it was something like that
[09:59:31] <shoky> hellyeah: we had it once, not now
[09:59:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:59:56] <hellyeah> man what is this "OMNOMNOMNOMNOM"
[10:00:07] <hellyeah> shoky:  why you dont have now
[10:00:08] <shoky> it's the sound b-ot makes when eating a snack
[10:00:10] <granden> taplar_afk: hellyeah Downgraded to 1.9.1 still the same problem. Strange thing is, that the page is acctually reloaded, and all teh fields are empty
[10:00:13] <hellyeah> abusing usage?
[10:00:31] <shoky> hellyeah: maybe, donno, i wasn't the one maintaining it
[10:00:34] <hellyeah> what yoru console say
[10:00:40] <hellyeah> btw ie console sucks too
[10:00:48] <hellyeah> shoky:  ic
[10:01:11] <hellyeah> anyway bbl
[10:01:24] <granden> hellyeah: I know :) Will try a vanilla JS solution as suggested by taplar
[10:04:46] <sigdk> Is there any difference whenever I enclose submit: inside the $.ajax { } braces compared to whenever it's out of them ?
[10:05:03] <sigdk> excuse me, I meant success:
[10:09:30] <haroldjfks> I can't let Chrome working with contains... neither indexof... what's the correct syntax to check if some text is inside a div with Chrome? eg. my div id is "myid"... I tried if ($("#myid").indexOf('text to find') > -1) but doesn't work
[10:09:59] <taplar> .text() or .html() then do indexOf()
[10:12:09] <taplar> and i meant to share this earlier too

[10:12:45] <jbc8> are there any jquery ui plugins that allow autocomplete to show recent items if it's focused and blank?
[10:25:58] <DFar> Hi all
[10:26:09] <taplar> yo
[10:26:55] <DFar> Is anyone knows how to use Jquery File Upload Plugin ?
[10:41:48] <Xatenev> DFar: Yes.
[10:41:59] <Xatenev> ?ask @ DFar
[10:41:59] <b-ot> second "Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers  or none at all. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help  the more likely you are to actually get help. http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before"
[10:42:49] <decx> man b-ot laying the smack down
[10:42:52] <DFar> I use "Basic Plus" version, and i want to delete files, but i don't understand the doc
[10:43:55] <DFar> Xatenev : I try to understand how "Basic Plus UI" work, in order to replicate in "Basic Plus"
[10:51:27] <hellyeah> hey
[10:51:38] <hellyeah> can i ask about my function and get some suggrestions here?
[10:52:40] <taplar> we don't like questions
[10:52:45] <taplar> not what the room is for
[10:52:45] <Uhkis> isn't that what you do every day? ;)
[10:52:56] <hellyeah> :X
[10:53:01] <taplar> just ask dude
[10:54:17] <hellyeah> can you check line 383 and 436 what can you say about my function and using $.extend i just want to collect all values from different element and put into array as an object create one element select dates and create second datepickers click pencilButton and see console?
[10:54:20] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/28/
[10:54:34] <hellyeah> it is not full of jquery btw
[10:55:56] <DFar> Xatenev : Still here ?
[10:57:04] <hellyeah> any thoughts? or this question does not belong to here. Either way i respect that
[10:58:16] <taplar> that's a very large fiddle
[10:59:19] <decx> so many lines wow
[10:59:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  i just told spesific lines anyway not important :XD
[10:59:29] <taplar> not the point
[10:59:39] <taplar> we ask everyone to make a small example showing the issue
[10:59:43] <taplar> you know this
[10:59:56] <decx> btw i tried my hand on that whole concept
[10:59:59] <hellyeah> okey i am sorry
[11:00:00] <hellyeah> xD
[11:00:01] <decx> selecting date ranges
[11:00:24] <hellyeah> decx:  if you see any bugs or smt pls let me now then
[11:00:43] <decx> hellyeah: no idea if this can be helpful for you, i just went from 0 https://jsfiddle.net/decx/u7xtmpmk/
[11:00:56] <hellyeah> decx:  let me see
[11:02:32] <hellyeah> decx:  that is great
[11:02:52] <decx> allows you to set a class and a title on disabled ranges
[11:03:03] <hellyeah> decx:  what is the purpose of title?
[11:03:05] <decx> so when you hover in the lower calendar you can tell which is it
[11:04:10] <hellyeah> when i hover below calendar is it supposed to show content of title?
[11:04:29] <decx> no when you hover a disabled date
[11:04:39] <decx> it'll have the title as title tooltip
[11:04:53] <hellyeah> this is what i meant yes
[11:06:18] <hellyeah> ic
[11:07:03] <hellyeah> decx:  thank you
[11:07:14] <decx> maybe you can get something out of it
[11:07:17] <decx> np
[11:07:39] <hellyeah> when you remove datepicker you create is there a functionality to remove spesific date of ranges?
[11:07:48] <hellyeah> i couldnt find that functionality
[11:07:53] <hellyeah> i need to make my own
[11:08:06] <decx> i just remap the whole thing
[11:08:24] <decx> rangediv.find(item) so group arrays of the inner find :input map
[11:08:31] <decx> to group*
[11:09:12] <hellyeah> yo remap when you click update button right
[11:09:30] <hellyeah> i can remap when you hit remove button also
[11:09:36] <decx> oh right yeah you can just put that in a separate function and call it on both
[11:09:47] <hellyeah> you mean with remap colorizing range of dates again right
[11:10:00] <hellyeah> that could be super
[11:10:15] <decx> just take everything in the .update click function and put it in a separate function
[11:10:19] <hellyeah> thanks to this i can remove spesific range of dates
[11:10:21] <decx> and call that on removes click
[11:10:32] <hellyeah> yeah i see that
[11:10:53] <decx> there's no this reference in there so you can just move it
[11:11:01] <hellyeah> decx:  i dont know you believe in god
[11:11:08] <hellyeah> either way i am gonna say god bless you
[11:11:20] <decx> i'll take it
[11:11:23] <hellyeah> decx:  i realized it is totally same thing
[11:11:35] <hellyeah> when you hit remove button
[11:11:40] <hellyeah> i will remove last element
[11:11:58] <hellyeah> it*
[11:12:01] <hellyeah> that make sense
[11:12:17] <hellyeah> actually in my fiddle i am trying to do same thing
[11:12:21] <hellyeah> remap
[11:12:28] <hellyeah> but this seems easier and readable
[11:12:31] <hellyeah> i will adopt it
[11:12:37] <decx> good good
[11:13:26] <hellyeah> but i will prefer to colorize background instead of box-shadow btw
[11:13:39] <hellyeah> the thing i understand you really saw my effort
[11:13:45] <hellyeah> thats really good for me
[11:14:04] <hellyeah> i feel really greate you really experienced programmer give me hand
[11:14:06] <hellyeah> :)
[11:14:09] <hellyeah> gave*
[11:21:06] <fermi> is there a way to prevent jquery from doing form valiadaion
[11:21:13] <fermi> its not letting me cancel forms
[11:24:07] <Xatenev> fermi: What do you mean? jquery doesnt do form validation on its own
[11:26:08] <fermi> i was wrong, i thought it was jquery doing it
[11:26:15] <fermi> its actually chrome being a !#$%^
[11:28:37] <nds_> I am building tables using a $(document).ready function, but i also have a translation script that goes through the DOM and changes strings based on language-setting. But when the table is build using one .ready function, the .ready function in my translation script will not find these. How is the best way to proceed?
[11:31:06] <zeroquake> Hello , how do you reset inline max-height property
[11:31:18] <taplar> set it to null
[11:31:40] <taplar> if by reset you mean remove
[11:31:53] <zeroquake> yes remove , i need to reset max-height
[11:32:08] <taplar> blank or null should cause it to be remove iirc
[11:33:18] <zeroquake> yup empty string removes it
[11:33:22] <zeroquake> thank you.
[11:49:23] <n11> I am having trouble putting on click requests on elements in an ajax request more than once.
[11:51:24] <taplar> show us what your trying
[11:52:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're binding in your then
[11:52:54] <n11> taplar: it's a bit complicated and I am not sure if I am ready to provide a live link. To explain:
[11:53:26] <taplar> just throw a snipplet in jsfiddle
[11:53:30] <taplar> doesn't have to work
[11:53:42] <taplar> just what your trying in your ajax
[11:53:48] <n11> taplar: not sure if I can do that, but I can try.
[11:54:38] <n11> anyway: I have a series of collapsible divs that hold ajax content. These ajax contents have links. I am trying to override the default link action and open the links in the div (i.e. ajax them in), or open them in one of the other collapsible divs.
[11:54:42] <n11> Make sense?
[11:54:52] <robertmaxrees> n11 use a delegated listener
[11:54:52] <taplar> yep
[11:55:31] <n11> It works the first time (to open another div), but when I go back to the original div and click the link again, it doesn't work.
[11:56:12] <n11> And I am using event listeners.
[11:56:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:56:26] <robertmaxrees> you probably want delegated listeners.
[11:56:58] <n11> Oh, what is the difference?
[11:57:05] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:57:15] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:57:19] <n11> cool, I will look at that.
[11:57:27] <decx> you can tell your kid to tell you when it falls down, or you can ask the parent to watch for any children fallng down
[11:57:34] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[11:58:01] <decx> i'm working on the delegation analogy
[11:58:04] <decx> it's just not there yet
[11:58:05] <decx> ^^
[11:58:24] <robertmaxrees> well you see events bubble up to the root of the document tree.
[11:58:25] <robertmaxrees> wait...
[11:58:27] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[12:00:50] <n11> robertmaxrees: so instead of:
[12:02:06] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service :)
[12:02:37] <n11> robertmaxrees: it was one linwe
[12:02:53] <n11> I just accidentally crashed my IRC client.
[12:03:26] <macabre> hey guys, i'm trying to grab the first element with class='read' and i'm able to grab it but since i'm looping through elements the console prints out the element i'm after n times https://gist.github.com/ibtjw/19eb34d36f1223c57c22
[12:03:42] <macabre> question is how do i return the first element once
[12:03:49] <n11> robertmaxrees: So instead of:
[12:03:50] <n11> $('a').on('click', linkCatcher);
[12:03:54] <n11> I do
[12:04:06] <n11> $('body').on('click', 'a', linkCatcher);
[12:04:11] <n11> correct?
[12:04:17] <robertmaxrees> bind further downt than body, but that's the idea.
[12:04:43] <n11> robertmaxrees: cool. I think body may work. I'll test it out.
[12:04:57] <n11> macabre: taking a look
[12:05:06] <macabre> n11: thanks
[12:06:35] <n11> macabre: do you have a live testing url?
[12:06:58] <macabre> n11: i don't
[12:07:02] <n11> OK
[12:07:15] <macabre> i can make a fiddle?
[12:07:28] <n11> macabre: that would be best
[12:08:37] <n11> robertmaxrees: yay! it works! thank you!
[12:08:51] <robertmaxrees> n11 you want to bind to a more contextually relevant area than body, but awesome :)
[12:09:07] <robertmaxrees> macabre why are you doing that in that each?
[12:09:22] <n11> robertmaxrees: well body is actually contextually relevant in my case.
[12:09:26] <robertmaxrees> or are you looking for the first child that has that class?
[12:09:35] <robertmaxrees> n11 'kay
[12:09:48] <robertmaxrees> n11 and make sure you're binding before your ajax stuff
[12:10:08] <macabre> robertmaxrees: yes, i'm looking for the first child but its giving me the same child over and over
[12:10:08] <n11> robertmaxrees: I have it first in line on the document.ready :)
[12:10:16] <robertmaxrees> n11 cool.
[12:10:32] <robertmaxrees> macabre .find('.someClass').first() should work fine.
[12:11:06] <macabre> robertmaxrees: i'll give it a shot
[12:11:15] <DFar> Is someone can tell me why my script doesn't work ? https://jsfiddle.net/1xvqedhm/
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> DFar open your console.
[12:11:48] <DFar> i've tried to trace with console.log()
[12:11:49] <robertmaxrees> invalid syntax.
[12:11:59] <robertmaxrees> DFar it's not running at all because you have a syntax error.
[12:12:14] <DFar> the script is voluntary uncomplete
[12:12:24] <robertmaxrees> DFar the code you have shown us is invalid syntax.
[12:12:29] <robertmaxrees> so it won't work at all.
[12:12:33] <n11> DFar: you are missing one character
[12:12:43] <n11> Look at the line where it is breaking
[12:12:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1xvqedhm/1/ missing a comma.
[12:13:26] <macabre> robertmaxrees: same thing, if i print the find element to the console it prints it out for each element that exists
[12:13:46] <robertmaxrees> you realize that you're running code in an each, right?
[12:13:59] <robertmaxrees> do you want the "first" one in the entire document once oooorrrr...?
[12:14:01] <macabre> yep but i'd like to get it out
[12:14:21] <n11> macabre: you don't need the each
[12:14:27] <robertmaxrees> macabre >.> then run it before or after the each.
[12:14:45] <macabre> the each goes through the elements to change the class
[12:14:46] <n11> robertmaxrees: ah.
[12:15:04] <n11> macabre: how many elements are you wanting to change?
[12:15:23] <robertmaxrees> you could do this just as easily with afilter.
[12:15:26] <macabre> n11: its a scrollbar thing, so the number of elements isnt fixed
[12:15:42] <n11> macabre: ok. I think it's best you make a fiddle.
[12:16:54] <robertmaxrees> also: why not just make .read turn things red?
[12:17:32] <macabre> because i need the id of color red
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:17:58] <macabre> the id of the element that is red
[12:18:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle then.
[12:20:00] <DFar> n11: robertmaxrees : still invalid ? https://jsfiddle.net/qpybu19r/
[12:20:39] <n11> check your console and see
[12:22:13] <DFar> i know how to use the console, my question is : why i can't handle a fileupload function  at a button append into another fileupload function
[12:22:28] <robertmaxrees> DFar huh?
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> you mean it's not running from dynamically added buttons?
[12:23:31] <Demonen> Are you attaching to it's click event after adding it to the DOM tree?
[12:23:43] <DFar> https://jsfiddle.net/qpybu19r/ Line 63 > what i want : At press _deleteHandler: function (e) { // what i've done : insert a console.log() into _deleteHandler
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> DFar you're not answering my question.
[12:23:55] <DFar> what it does : nothing
[12:24:10] <robertmaxrees> Do you mean that fileupload isn't running for a dynamically added element?
[12:25:06] <DFar> yes, fileupload won't work with delete button dynamically added
[12:25:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you need to initialize after you add the button.
[12:25:24] <DFar> maybe i don't wrote the right syntax, but i don't know where
[12:25:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[12:26:18] <DFar> i'm on the API since 2 days
[12:26:37] <robertmaxrees> right, so you might need to manually call the delete by using a delegated listener.
[12:27:18] <DFar> can you explain me how i can do that ?
[12:27:25] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:27:30] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:29:54] <DFar> ok, i wrote .trigger instead of .on, my bad
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> .trigger() is to trigger events.  you want to bind a listener to that delete button and manually call the delete method.
[12:32:02] <DFar> but i'm confused with the this inside the .on - and the this (the fileupload object)
[12:32:24] <robertmaxrees> `this` will not be the fileupload object inside of .on()
[12:32:28] <robertmaxrees> it will be the clicked element.
[12:32:39] <DFar> ok, i agree
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> errr lol
[12:32:51] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to agree with - that's how it works.
[12:33:13] <Demonen> $('#parent').on('click','button',function(){ /* delegated events, woo! */ });
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:34:03] <Demonen> They're magical. Seriously.
[12:34:08] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:34:22] <robertmaxrees> event bubbling is a really important concept to grok.  it's why i link those two pages.
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> read both of them - things will make a LOT more sense.
[12:35:07] <DFar> yes but #button is not inside #parent
[12:35:11] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:35:16] <robertmaxrees> that's an example.
[12:35:30] <robertmaxrees> #parent can be any element that exists on pageload that's an ancestor of the button.
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> read the pages I linked :) they explain all of this very clearly.
[12:36:32] <Demonen> Just don't $('body').on(), or I will have to seize your keyboard.
[12:36:39] <decx> if people knew what a pain repeating eventlisteners for separate elements is in js they'd understand the benefits of delegation/e.target use much better
[12:37:45] <macabre> robertmaxrees: a hack to make this work is detect once the scrollbar has stopped? is the an opposite to on scroll?
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> macabre wat
[12:38:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> there's a scroll event.
[12:38:06] <macabre> didn't think so
[12:38:10] <DFar> I think I'll read delegation, but it probably will not correspond to my problem
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> DFar it absolutely does.
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to manually set up that binding yourself.
[12:38:30] <Demonen> DFar: It is at the very heart and core of your problem.
[12:41:08] <n11> Is there a way to select all children except for the nth child?
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> you could use .filter(), or you could .slice(), or...
[12:41:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:41:34] <DFar> Thank you
[12:41:35] <decx> you want slice
[12:41:37] <taplar> :not(:nth-child(#))
[12:41:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, lots of ways
[12:42:00] <decx> get all and slice per index, no need to go through the whole collection with filter
[12:42:13] <n11> taplar: will try that
[12:43:07] <robertmaxrees> decx was just providing the different objects.
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> also - i'd personally avoid the selector syntax, buuut meh.
[14:07:25] <mmmveggies> It's like writing regex, perfectly entropic
[14:07:55] <taplar> o_O
[14:07:59] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:08:13] <mmmveggies> I meat.. golf.. something
[14:08:14] <arc_> internet
[14:09:15] <taplar> mmm, the things we say to avoid the silence
[14:09:37] <taplar> ^ that's deep right there
[14:10:35] <taplar> sorry, got a free slushie and made an inuendo filled board post.  pretty happy with myself right now
[14:11:29] <mmmveggies> indulgent bastard
[14:11:40] <taplar> hey, leave my momma out of it
[14:12:40] <mmmveggies> I'm sorry. I forgot lunch and I didn't wear green today
[14:13:04] <taplar> i never do the green thing.
[14:20:20] <islalobo> We're using length to check the existence of things and we occasionally get this error "Cannot us 'in' operator to search for 'length' in []"
[14:20:35] <robertmaxrees> can you reproduce it?
[14:20:41] <islalobo> What is a better what to check if 1. variable is set 2. variable is not null
[14:20:59] <robertmaxrees> if (variable) {}
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> but that error has nothing to do with a var being set fwiw.
[14:21:14] <taplar> i saw an 'in' error the other day, but someone was trying to each over a single object
[14:21:28] <islalobo> It happens only when the user first logs in for the first time ever and cache is …null maybe. I'll try that. I feel like there was a reason for not doing that and for going this stranger route
[14:21:43] <robertmaxrees> you should have the var.
[14:21:45] <robertmaxrees> it should exist.
[14:22:08] <mmmveggies> if you don't know if the reference exist, you gotta use typeof
[14:22:18] <robertmaxrees> but the reference SHOULD exist imo.
[14:22:26] <islalobo> There could be cases where it returns an array and cases where it returns an object. If I'm not checking correctly would that error make sense?
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> that should never happen.
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you should only return one or the other.
[14:23:14] <taplar> part of the whole endpoint contract thing
[14:23:34] <taplar> consistency is important
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> very
[14:24:16] <anotheryou> hi. I got a simple page with 2 "tabs". I simply need to toggle between which div is visible, but also toggle via an anchor for deep linking. Is there something more leightweight than jquery-ui tabs? (had issues with other js on the page)
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou what's the "other js"?
[14:24:47] <anotheryou> robertmaxrees, some list sorting
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> you could pretty easily build something like that yourself, even.
[14:25:06] <anotheryou> robertmaxrees, jup, wondered if i should invest the 20 min it takes me :)
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> i don't see why not.
[14:25:18] <anotheryou> ok :)
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty quick.
[14:25:21] <decx> bbq is dead
[14:25:26] <taplar> :O
[14:25:36] <decx> and that was the best thing a few years ago
[14:25:37] <anotheryou> I'll do that than, thx
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> oh that history bbq thing?
[14:25:49] <decx> right
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> i always hated it.
[14:26:02] <decx> never used it
[14:26:05] <taplar> i thought you were talking about food.  lame decx
[14:26:20] <robertmaxrees> i wrote my own pushstate/hash fallback support thing on my own becuase bbq was so awkwar.
[14:26:23] <decx> just have a map of your targets, create a collection and filter on click or hashchange
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> *awkward
[14:27:03] <decx> it worked well enough but that was years ago
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[14:27:12] <robertmaxrees> >:)
[14:27:12] <decx> used it like once
[14:27:14] <decx> ^^
[14:27:22] <decx> and when i checked back on it it was dead
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, kind of fell out of favor.
[14:45:07] <glassir> Anyone have a minute to glance at a jsfiddle? Struggling with a rookie issue.
[14:46:34] <taplar> do it!
[14:47:09] <glassir> http://jsfiddle.net/gf059dnz/4/
[14:47:41] <taplar> what issue are you seeing?
[14:48:52] <glassir> I'm trying to revert the clickable items to the original state once you close the content again
[14:49:23] <glassir> Removing the opacity changing class on all items. But I'm struggling with selecting it correctly.
[15:02:38] <shoky> glassir:  here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/gf059dnz/5/
[15:04:18] <glassir> shaky: That is perfect! Thank you so much!
[15:05:22] <decx> great stuff there sheky
[15:05:46] * shoky shooks about
[15:05:58] <decx> haha that shüky
[15:06:10] <taplar> i lost the dim, but i switched up the markup a little http://jsfiddle.net/gf059dnz/6/
[15:06:14] <shoky> hhh
[15:06:35] <glassir> Sorry for getting the name wrong, too much opacity on the irc client :)
[15:06:58] <decx> i'm impressed how you still wrote the autocomplete :
[15:08:09] <glassir> Not very dim myself.
[15:08:53] <taplar> there we go http://jsfiddle.net/gf059dnz/7/
[15:26:23] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[15:39:52] <jbc8> is there a tool like 3v4l.org/ for testing different versions of jquery?
[15:40:32] <jbc8> i mean trying a page with a bunch of different versions of jquery to test compatibility
[15:40:40] <taplar> jsfiddle?
[15:40:52] <taplar> you can swap them pretty easily
[15:56:41] <lonequid> Is there an event I can use to detect when an element is created?
[15:57:39] <taplar> no
[15:59:51] <lonequid> I guess DOMNodeInserted is my best option
[16:05:14] <Uhkis> lonequid: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[16:21:01] <lonequid> Uhkis: awesome, thanks
[16:35:40] <funyun_> hi. can anyone help? i'm trying to make a slider but it's displaying both images large and not switching when i click the small images. https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/random-images-5011/slider.html
[16:35:44] <funyun_> https://jsfiddle.net/tfyko5jy/
[16:36:37] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you use jsfiddle.
[16:36:40] <robertmaxrees> *not
[16:37:01] <funyun_> robertmaxrees: ??
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> just HTML in the html spot and just js in the js spot.
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> and only the code you need for it to run.
[16:37:19] <robertmaxrees> this has a bunch of fonts and stuff included.
[16:38:19] <funyun_> robertmaxrees: sorry, i'm new to this. which is why i'm seeking help
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:38:58] <robertmaxrees> and open your console on that aws page.
[16:39:06] <robertmaxrees> you'll see the errors pretty quickly.
[16:39:40] <robertmaxrees> the issue is you're on an https page but you're linking http versions of things.
[16:40:00] <funyun_> ah
[17:45:31] <funyun_> robertmaxrees: that worked. thank you so much :)
[18:02:43] <cash> Hey
[18:03:05] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[18:03:18] <cash> Hey there, I dont get this mapping stuff
[18:03:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:03:38] <cash> https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/845940392a9cea36903c
[18:03:53] <robertmaxrees> what don't you understand?
[18:05:02] <cash> So in this entry: http://api.pearson.com/v2/dictionaries/ldec/entries?headword=cat how exactly am i supposed to get  translations within senses
[18:06:46] <robertmaxrees> yourData.results[index].sensex[index].translation
[18:06:51] <robertmaxrees> you're confused by JSON.
[18:06:57] <cash> both
[18:07:02] <robertmaxrees> nah, just JSON.
[18:07:21] <robertmaxrees> once you understand basic structures, .map() makes a lot more sense.
[18:07:59] <cash> so in that piece you just showed me, I have to use a counter then, correct?
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:08:13] <cash> but doesn't index change?
[18:08:19] <robertmaxrees> i was just using [index] to illustrate that it's via array index.
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish with that data?
[18:08:38] <cash> just to display them
[18:08:46] <robertmaxrees> display what?
[18:08:50] <robertmaxrees> all of it?  some of it?
[18:08:59] <cash> as many as there are
[18:09:08] <robertmaxrees> okay, what data in there?
[18:10:13] <cash> each translation
[18:10:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:10:22] <robertmaxrees> show me what you want duder.
[18:10:59] <robertmaxrees> just saying "i want to display everything" is pretty broad.
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> it really depends on how you want it to look.
[18:11:10] <cash> Im not sure what you mean, I mean every 'translation' within 'senses'
[18:11:26] <robertmaxrees> so for every result, show all translations in the senses array?
[18:12:01] <cash> yes
[18:13:01] <robertmaxrees> you can do nested .maps() for that, then.
[18:14:54] <cash> okay thanks let me check it out!
[18:16:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3f7wsm91/
[18:16:46] <robertmaxrees> looks like there are also "subsenses" to worry about.
[18:16:54] <robertmaxrees> but you should get the idea.
[18:21:50] <cash> I see
[18:21:56] <cash> Im still looking at it
[18:22:03] <cash> Im getting a syntax error on the json
[18:23:55] <robertmaxrees> where?
[18:24:46] <cash> when i 1st open the json on the semicolon
[18:24:54] <cash> my fault im sure
[18:25:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:27:50] <cash> this is different than the last one you showed me
[18:28:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:28:46] <robertmaxrees> you keep changing your question and data.
[18:28:47] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[18:28:50] <robertmaxrees> things are going to change.
[18:37:08] <cash> why can't I do this: https://jsfiddle.net/zbu2wpop/ ?
[18:37:15] <cash> because it is a string?
[18:37:32] <robertmaxrees> theData is just a url there.
[18:37:39] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing anything with it.
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to load the data from that URL?
[18:38:18] <cash> yes, this is what i am actually trying to do: https://jsfiddle.net/zbu2wpop/1/
[18:38:40] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[18:39:52] <cash> I do but it give me an error
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> and that error is...?
[18:40:25] <robertmaxrees> the "missing ; before statement"?
[18:41:30] <robertmaxrees> or the "blocked loading mixed active content"?
[18:41:42] <cash>  Unexpected token :
[18:41:52] <cash> when t hits the 1st semicolon in the json
[18:41:54] <robertmaxrees> you realize you're not loading JSONP there, right?
[18:42:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zbu2wpop/2/
[18:43:16] <cash> Your right
[18:43:21] <cash> I had to switch it to json
[18:43:25] <robertmaxrees> just kill that off.
[18:43:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't need dataType - jquery often figures it out for you.
[18:43:41] <cash> i cant, then i get a CORS error
[18:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you also need to kill the protocol from the url.
[18:44:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zbu2wpop/2/ you'll see this works fine.
[18:44:55] <cash> "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource."
[18:45:09] <cash> if i make it json and not json p it works
[18:45:34] <cash> You are good
[18:45:38] <cash> how do i get good
[18:45:45] <robertmaxrees> practice
[18:45:47] <robertmaxrees> experience.
[18:46:26] <cash> how long have you been practicing?
[18:46:57] <robertmaxrees> lol i've been a developer for a few years.
[18:47:09] <cash> +5?
[18:47:15] <robertmaxrees> i think so?
[18:47:25] <cash> cool
[18:47:30] <robertmaxrees> though that's irrelevant.
[18:47:36] <robertmaxrees> exposure and learning are relevant.
[18:49:50] <cash> im a 'developer'
[18:49:54] <cash> but i suck
[18:50:04] <robertmaxrees> step one: don't put quotes around that word.
[18:50:09] <robertmaxrees> do you write code?
[18:50:21] <cash> yeah
[18:50:28] <robertmaxrees> then you're a developer.
[18:50:31] <cash> some basic php
[18:50:48] <robertmaxrees> no need to act like you're less than anybody else.  just need to develop skills.
[18:51:40] <cash> are you a cs major?
[18:51:42] <D-rex> cash: it's mistakes and sucking that make people experts.
[18:51:52] <D-rex> you learn from them
[18:51:56] <robertmaxrees> cash nope.
[18:51:59] <robertmaxrees> totally self taught.
[18:52:09] <cash> snapppp
[18:52:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll get there.
[18:52:56] <D-rex> cash: do you work for that foundation?  other than the developement end
[18:53:05] <robertmaxrees> what foundation?
[18:53:12] <D-rex> the pearson.com
[18:53:22] <cash> hah no, i wish i was a developer for them
[18:53:31] <cash> that would be a better gig im sure
[18:53:37] <robertmaxrees> looks like he's just using a publicly available api.
[18:53:45] <cash> yeah
[18:53:47] <D-rex> ok
[18:53:49] <cash> building a toy app
[18:54:34] <cash> are you a full stack dev ?
[18:54:46] <robertmaxrees> "full stack dev" is a poorly understood term.
[18:54:57] <robertmaxrees> I write code in a lot of different parts of our stack, but I focus on frontend.
[18:55:08] <cash> Hmm I see
[18:55:20] <cash> cool
[18:55:37] <mmmveggies> robertmaxrees did you see the stackoverflow report
[18:55:45] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:56:02] <mmmveggies> http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-occupation
[18:56:16] <robertmaxrees> okay, and?
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:56:31] <robertmaxrees> people use that term a lot - what does it mean?
[18:56:33] <mmmveggies> I just thought it was funny
[18:56:41] <robertmaxrees> 'cause people loooove to toss it around.
[18:57:26] <cash> well my battery is dead, so i guess I should go home
[18:57:30] <cash> thanks for the help!
[18:57:35] <mmmveggies> IMO it means they're contractors who spin up wordpress sites
[18:57:48] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies i see a lot of people who don't do that who describe themselves that way.
[18:59:27] <mmmveggies> More seriously, it probably means that they work on database maintenance up through middleware design/programming and web design/programming
[19:02:25] <robertmaxrees> heh, that doesn't describe a lot of the ones i know.
[19:02:27] <robertmaxrees> but sure :)
[22:23:38] <robertpaulson> hello!
