[05:28:06] <interop_madness> hello, i am getting xhr.status==0 for a request known to succeed with exactly the same URL, verb and headers in Fiddler.
[05:28:48] <interop_madness> as soon as i add context.Response.Buffer = true; server-side, the request works in jQuery, however, buffering is inacceptable, so i need a bufferless solution
[05:29:08] <interop_madness> it has nothing to do with CORS, the request is to a relative URL
[05:29:16] <interop_madness> any ideas welcome.
[06:49:53] <neo_> I made big sin :(
[06:50:05] <neo_> I deceived Jew :) :) :)
[06:50:15] <neo_> hi guys
[06:50:36] <neo_> I want show off , see my map https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/qXBPjP
[06:50:56] <neo_> perfect :)
[06:51:05] <neo_> ly*
[06:51:21] <neo_> certainly cool :)
[06:51:41] <neo_> this is anecdot about Jew :)
[06:51:52] <neo_> it's not sin it's wander if you deceived Jew :)
[06:52:24] <neo_> how you my map ? https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/qXBPjP
[07:47:21] <r3v3rb> morning - is any one using gmaps jquery plugin?
[08:14:10] <r3v3rb> I have an ajax call getting a json string to parse into the gmaps geocoder - I need to be able to access the outer item from here in the addMarker part : https://jsfiddle.net/6w939ev7/ any ideas?
[08:15:51] <r3v3rb> i've read that it's to do with the asynchronous nature of the callback in geocode but can't for the life of me see how to wrap the callback into a closure
[08:16:29] <r3v3rb> at the moment each marker gets the last item.name returned due to the loop
[08:37:24] <neo_> good evening guys :)
[08:37:52] <neo_> living in my living in my dream ....
[10:05:21] <schiu> Hi all. I need a quick and dirty jQuery hack for changing "<label>Test: </label><div><input type=text value='Hello World'></div>" to "<div><label>Test: </label><input type=text value='Hello World'></div>". Any hints?
[10:15:50] <taplar> schiu: it would be better to change how it is built in the first place, instead of manipulating it with js after the fact
[10:17:33] <schiu> taplar: yeah, that's why I called it quick and dirty. but you're right, it's more a kind of slow and dirty ...
[10:17:53] <localh0st> schiu: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/10754/
[10:18:10] <localh0st> anyway, taplar is right ;)
[10:18:49] <schiu> localh0st, taplar: thx so much. I will consider your advises
[10:22:23] <schiu> localh0st: at least I learned a lot of jQuery studying your great function, thx a lot!
[10:24:34] <FilipNortic_> schiu: note that you can't use closest to search for child elements just parents (many new users get tripped up there)
[10:25:12] <schiu> FilipNortic: ok, thx!
[10:53:18] <neo_> :)
[11:27:12] <neo_> who know clipboard app ? I want assign shift + c one buffer
[11:27:18] <neo_> and shift + v other
[11:30:03] <neo_> who used ditto ?
[11:30:46] <neo_> it's it http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/
[11:30:58] <neo_> or advised so which we using ?
[12:14:48] <GeekMonkey> I have a function in my main.js and have another js file being called in... I am trying to refer to a function in the first JS but it isn't working
[12:14:52] <GeekMonkey> it says it is undefined
[12:15:12] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey is that function in main.js defined within another function?
[12:15:18] <robertmaxrees> like, maybe an IIFE or a document ready?
[12:15:28] <robertmaxrees> and/or are they being loaded out-of-order?
[12:16:33] <donald> I made a function in javascript I can not write in php to get interactions with the user and I want to save these in a database with php. A few helpers in internet send me the jQuery.ajax() function. I do jQuery.ajax("site.php", "GET", "variable=123"); with $_GET["variable"]; but nothing changed, the variable has not been received. Are you sure ajax is the best way to transmit datas from javascript to php?
[12:16:48] <GeekMonkey> no... it is wrapped in a jQuery(function($) { function equalheight(container){....
[12:17:00] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey that's why
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey it's an issue of scope.  can't access it outside of that scope.
[12:17:38] <donald> eekMonkey: me?
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> donald no
[12:17:52] <donald> ok
[12:17:57] <robertmaxrees> donald your issue is you're using $.ajax() incorrectly :)
[12:18:16] <da_wunder> donald: your syntax is wrong
[12:18:21] <GeekMonkey> but I am trying to call it within a window.load
[12:18:32] <da_wunder> donald: see the docs http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey then defined it in a shared scope.
[12:18:46] <robertmaxrees> *define
[12:18:53] <GeekMonkey> how can I do that?
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> define it outside of the document ready.
[12:19:31] <GeekMonkey> I can't modify main.js
[12:19:42] <robertmaxrees> then you can't access the object.
[12:19:53] <robertmaxrees> donald https://bpaste.net/show/0a9e1973db8d
[12:19:58] <GeekMonkey> it has to be within the jQuery(function($) it is wordpress
[12:20:21] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey dunno what to tell you.  you cannot access and object if you cannot access its scope.
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> let's flip this around - why do you need access to this function?
[12:26:34] <donald> https://paste.debian.net/977956/
[12:27:02] <robertmaxrees> donald i showed you how to write it already.
[12:27:07] <robertmaxrees> did you not see it?
[12:27:53] <donald> robertmaxrees: isthere any difference?
[12:27:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:27:58] <robertmaxrees> a big one.
[12:28:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't pass in "GET" like that, for starters.
[12:28:27] <da_wunder> yep
[12:28:28] <donald> I just cahnged the "
[12:28:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:38] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/0a9e1973db8d
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ you want this.
[12:29:04] <donald> yes it is very different
[12:29:12] <da_wunder> donald: and if you looked that doc page that i give you, you should realize that your syntax is wrong
[12:29:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[12:35:24] <GeekMonkey> I have this equal height function but it isn't giving me the right height
[12:35:38] <GeekMonkey> it is making it 258px when it should be 158px
[12:35:49] <GeekMonkey> any thoughts why it would add an extra 100 px
[12:35:55] <donald> jQuery.ajax({url: "site.php", method: "GET", data: {"variable": 123}, datatype: "html"}); => deos not return any error but does not send the datas
[12:36:16] <robertmaxrees> donald you don't need to specify datatype
[12:36:20] <robertmaxrees> also: check your network tab.
[12:37:20] <donald> the jquery script to import squery is the only which returns 304 Not Modified
[12:37:24] <GeekMonkey> figured it out.... I wrapped it with a div and as the inner div had padding that was messing up the calculations I guess
[12:39:07] <robertmaxrees> donald mind sharing your code then?
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> via a bpaste or something?
[12:40:59] <donald> ok
[12:43:10] <donald> https://paste.debian.net/977957/
[12:43:34] <robertmaxrees> and the javascript?
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm i see it now.
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> try killing the dataType
[12:44:26] <robertmaxrees> and then watch your network tab for the request on pageload.
[12:45:01] <donald> https://paste.debian.net/977958/
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, try that.
[12:45:47] <donald> jquery-3.2.1.js still has a 304 error
[12:45:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not an erro9r.
[12:46:01] <robertmaxrees> 304 means "not modified.
[12:46:25] <donald> ok
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> do this: open your network tab, make sure you're not filtering any requests, and then reload the page.
[12:48:03] <donald> how to check if any request is filtered?
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> are you using chrome?
[12:48:52] <donald> no firefox
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> because if so, https://i.imgur.com/M77MOkO.png
[12:48:58] <robertmaxrees> ah.  simialr thing for ff.
[12:49:21] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/UYrPTxk.png
[12:50:45] <donald> nothing is filtered
[12:51:05] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like your script file isn't getting included then.
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> have you make sure you have a script tag pointing to it?
[12:51:23] <robertmaxrees> *made
[12:52:07] <donald> what is a script tag?
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:52:42] <robertmaxrees> how are you including your code into the page?
[12:54:58] <robertmaxrees> donald
[12:55:49] <donald> robertmaxrees: i include script.js by <script> and php with <?php ?>
[12:56:17] <donald> ah I see
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:58:56] <donald> https://paste.debian.net/977959/
[12:59:06] <donald> robertmaxrees: plop
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> does it work now?
[13:07:13] <donald> no
[13:07:30] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing the request fire in the network tab?
[13:08:19] <donald> no
[13:08:42] <robertmaxrees> try https://bpaste.net/show/61be09693a35
[13:08:45] <robertmaxrees> and watch your console.
[13:09:22] <donald> what does then do?
[13:09:45] <robertmaxrees> right now your code just fires a request.  it doesn't do anything with the response.
[13:09:58] <robertmaxrees> the page doesn't magically update for you.
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to do something with the response.
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> .then() is one way to do that.
[13:12:39] <donald> .then(function(data) { 	console.log(data); }); <= what is the variable data?
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> that's the response from the server
[13:12:59] <robertmaxrees> that should log whatever the ajax call gets back.
[13:15:01] <donald> it is strange I can see the code with 123 display like it should work in the console but not on the page
[13:15:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:15:17] <da_wunder> donald:
[13:15:18] <robertmaxrees> are you not seeing anything in the console?
[13:15:53] <donald> robertmaxrees:  yes on the console  I can read my own code with javascript and php modifications
[13:16:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  so your code is working.
[13:16:11] <da_wunder> you're on that site.php page, then you're making a new ajax request to that same page, original page that you've opened in your browser will not update...
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> the php is running, but since you're using ajax the page won't magically update.
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> since the browser already has the page.
[13:17:08] <da_wunder> and you're not updating that page any way after that ajax request is made
[13:17:12] <donald> how to syncronize both parts?
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> manually.
[13:17:20] <donald> by updating?
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  you use that .then() to update the page.
[13:17:40] <da_wunder> donald: what is your goal ?
[13:17:40] <donald> with the event load?
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:17:48] <donald> ahok
[13:18:10] <donald> da_wunder: save the interactions of the user into a database
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> it's ajax - the point is to fire a request without reloading the page.
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> donald i'd start by moving that php code to a standalone file of some kind.
[13:18:38] <da_wunder> and how is that related to your html page update ?
[13:19:20] <donald> da_wunder: I do not undersatnd your question
[13:19:40] <da_wunder> donald: why you need to change that site.php content after that request ?
[13:19:50] <da_wunder> what is the purpose of that ?
[13:19:53] <robertmaxrees> da_wunder i think he's just trying to learn the basics of ajax.
[13:20:42] <donald> da_wunder: to test if the variable has been got to test if the mecanism is operationnal for the future
[13:20:55] <donald> robertmaxrees: good point
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> donald yeah, so pull that php code out into a separate file.
[13:21:13] <robertmaxrees> whose job is to handle ajax requests for that particular route
[13:21:26] <donald> yes I had previewed to do it
[13:21:46] <donald> (I spoke abut to separate files
[13:21:54] <da_wunder> donald: ok, you have server response on your .then() part, just do what ever you like with it
[13:22:21] <da_wunder> donald: but eg. in that case i would not send html page back, use json
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[13:22:39] <robertmaxrees> right, hence my suggestion for pulling the php into another file.
[13:22:53] <robertmaxrees> then use a better format to send the data.
[13:22:57] <robertmaxrees> like JSON
[13:23:23] <da_wunder> or start to use some framework for that php part
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> sure, though if he's just learning the basics, i wouldn't add the cognitive overhead of anm entire framework quite yet.
[13:27:25] <donald> robertmaxrees: I still do not have the code running. What is nextnow?
[13:28:49] <robertmaxrees> you said you're getting stuff in the console, right?
[13:29:26] <balance> hi
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> hello balance
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:30:26] <balance> I have a list of pairs of images. if I hover over one, the other should be displayed. basically this: https://bpaste.net/show/585fa7b0346a the problem here is, that it does the wanted effect for all of the images simultaneously instead of just the pair I hovered over. I see why the code does this but I can't imagen an easy way to change it. any hints?
[13:31:01] <balance> actually wait a minute
[13:33:45] <donald> robertmaxrees: you said you're getting stuff in the console, right? => yes
[13:34:04] <da_wunder> ok, then your application is working like expected
[13:34:39] <donald> robertmaxrees: you saw my steps. So do you think I use the rightway to transmit datas to php from javascript?
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> aaaand back.
[13:35:06] <da_wunder> donald: use JSON for data, then use that data as you like
[13:35:39] <robertmaxrees> donald yeah get that php for the ajax call into a separate file and have it shunt back JSON.
[13:38:10] <donald> ok right
[14:15:00] <donald> when I send a variable from javascript file to php file, the main page in html is still running and call the php page. How to syncronize them?
[14:16:33] <robertmaxrees> you manually update the page.
[14:17:19] <da_wunder> donald: as told you already, refactor your php side to return JSON, not the whole page, then on your ajax call success function do whatever you want with that data
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:17:42] <da_wunder> eg. jQuery('#someID').html(data);
[14:18:18] <robertmaxrees> donald http://learn.jquery.com/
[14:18:24] <robertmaxrees> this is a great resource tor get the basics going.
[14:19:12] <donald> robertmaxrees: even by manual update, the variable is not show
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> donald what do you mean "by manual update"?
[14:19:45] <da_wunder> donald: how you're doing that update ?
[14:19:53] <donald> robertmaxrees: ask to the user to reload the page himself
[14:20:01] <da_wunder> :D
[14:20:04] <robertmaxrees> donald that won't work
[14:20:18] <da_wunder> donald: that variable is gone if you just make a reload
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> the page will only have that data display if the request has that parameter set.
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> if you reload the page, you're re-requesting it without that get variable.
[14:20:43] <donald> location.reload() does not work too
[14:20:48] <robertmaxrees> right, that's the same thing.
[14:20:54] <da_wunder> ^
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> the get variable is only good for that request.
[14:21:19] <robertmaxrees> if you reload the page, you're doing another request.  you don't have that querystring param so it won't display.
[14:21:35] <robertmaxrees> so really what you want is to use javascript to write that data to the page.
[14:22:16] <donald> robertmaxrees: so really what you want is to use javascript to write that data to the page. => I do not understand the question
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not a question :)
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a statement.
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> what about it is confusing?
[14:23:26] <donald> robertmaxrees: the confusing points are how to display the variable and store the php in another file
[14:23:40] <robertmaxrees> so remember that whole .then() bit?
[14:23:56] <da_wunder> donald: i'll create a example for you one sec
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> da_wunder let him step through it pls :)
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's coding by proxy.
[14:24:50] <da_wunder> robertmaxrees: i'm going to make this one really simple
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) good luck
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> there are tons of examples in learn.jquery.com
[14:33:01] <da_wunder> donald: http://wunder.sytes.net:6969/donald/
[14:34:09] <da_wunder> donald: and all the sources for that https://gist.github.com/tarlepp/7a215af3439fb62ef684f5eddfdfe306
[14:48:31] <WhirledPress> Good afternoon, is there a way to ensure that $.fn.add only adds a unique element to the collection?
[14:50:24] <WhirledPress> or is this automagically handled by the nature of the jquery object? then to override it (for multiple copies of one item) you'd have to use an array?
[14:52:47] <donald> da_wunder: I have not finished to read your example. Give me more time. Otherwhere contrary to bdd.php site.php is the main page you think with index.html.
[15:25:30] <donald> https://gist.github.com/tarlepp/7a215af3439fb62ef684f5eddfdfe306 where is called site.php?
[15:31:14] <da_wunder> donald: you can rename it whatever you like
[15:31:28] <da_wunder> donald: you was using that on your example so i used the same one
[15:31:54] <donald> da_wunder: no I did not rename any file
[15:32:11] <da_wunder> donald: or do you mean where that is requested via ajax ?
[15:33:23] <donald> no I just ask where is called site.php (I do not make attention of the name of the file)
[15:33:37] <da_wunder> "where is called"
[15:33:45] <da_wunder> don't understand what you mean with that
[15:34:57] <da_wunder> donald: total 35 line of code there should not be anything unclear with those
[15:36:22] <donald> I mean if I look at step by step what I want to do, I have: 1-I read the main page 2-information on the user is get by the javascript's script 3-the javascript send these to the php's file 4- at last but not least, the user's interaction is storred in the database
[15:37:36] <da_wunder> donald: step 1 is index.html
[15:38:01] <donald> da_wunder: the problem is in the step 4
[15:38:05] <da_wunder> donald: step 2, don't understand what you're getting by javascript and how
[15:38:16] <da_wunder> step 4 is your php file
[15:39:02] <donald> because tough I know how to get them on the file in php, i can not call the php's script in index.html
[15:39:05] <da_wunder> donald: eg. open your database connection, parse request data, create query and execute it
[15:40:37] <donald> da_wunder: the problem does not come from the php file by itself but by the way it is called by javascript
[15:40:55] <da_wunder> donald: simple example https://gist.github.com/tarlepp/21e4f661a4f7609bb3af1c4d2e9ff2e6
[15:41:05] <da_wunder> donald: and what is the problem with that ?
[15:42:43] <donald> the user is not supposed to visit directly site.php
[15:42:56] <donald> he must call him from index.html intead
[15:43:23] <da_wunder> donald: then make default action to just redirect to index.html
[15:43:42] <da_wunder> donald: but that php script must be a public, otherwise you cannot access to that
[15:44:25] <donald> da_wunder: I planified to access to it by the balise <script src="site.php"> </script>
[15:44:45] <da_wunder> what
[15:45:09] <da_wunder> it seems like you haven't a much knowledge of web dev
[15:45:13] <donald> I used to think I have to call it from index.html
[15:45:28] <da_wunder> donald: and that is what i'm doing on that example...
[15:45:43] <da_wunder> i gave you live example + sources for that
[15:46:12] <donald> da_wunder: yes I do php to get ahead on my classrooms for my second degree of developpement
[15:46:29] <donald> most of what I know is from internet
[15:47:09] <donald> but indeed I do different things differents of webdeveloppement like make application etc...
[15:47:55] <donald> wait... php seems to be called by url: 'site.php',
[15:49:04] <da_wunder> ...
[15:49:16] <da_wunder> no shit sherlock
[15:50:08] <donald> I did not read enough the doc
[15:50:11] <donald> let me do that
[15:50:53] <da_wunder> donald: my example had 35 lines, you didn't read those even ?
[15:53:53] <donald> yes I have already read it but I use jQuery.ajax({}) only to send and get datas, not to execute a php script (wich is what I try to do) and today I use jquery for the first time
[16:01:34] <da_wunder> donald: that makes a http request, and that request is made to that site.php, so when that ajax call is made that site.php is runned

[17:07:28] <origamiwork> Hello everyone, I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).draggable is not a function" when I include jquery then jqueryui then the code $("#draggable").draggable({handle:".modal-header"})};   I'm including the files in the correct order jquery then jqueryui then custom code, and I've tried several different versions of jquery. Any ideas? Thanks
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[17:22:12] <jak2000> hi all
[17:22:41] <jak2000> $('#fecha_start').val(moment().subtract('months', 1).calendar());    give me: '06/24/2017' format mm/dd/yyyy i want this format: yyyy/mm/aa
[17:22:59] <origamiwork> nm, I figured it out, someone included jquery twice
[17:23:09] <jak2000> err: yyyy/mm/dd
[17:23:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 https://stackoverflow.com/a/15994039/923919
[17:23:32] <robertmaxrees> gotta format it using moment
[17:24:06] <jak2000> yes i know
[17:24:11] <jak2000> i have 2 lines:
[17:24:18] <jak2000> $("#fecha_start").datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd'});
[17:24:19] <jak2000>     $('#fecha_start').val(moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD'));
[17:24:20] <robertmaxrees> so what's your confusion?
[17:24:25] <jak2000> and the third: $('#fecha_start').val(moment().subtract('months', 1).calendar());
[17:24:48] <jak2000> last line display: '06/24/2017'
[17:24:50] <jak2000> :(
[17:24:52] <robertmaxrees> wait, are you only using moment to format the date?
[17:25:23] <jak2000> i use moment
[17:25:29] <jak2000> and jquery-ui as the datepicker
[17:25:47] <robertmaxrees> right, but are you only using moment to format the dates?
[17:25:56] <robertmaxrees> because jquery-ui datepicker supports formatting dates./
[17:26:02] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> can totally skip moment entirely.
[17:28:12] <jak2000> is this: $("#fecha_start").datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd'});
[17:28:13] <jak2000> ?
[17:28:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) is it?  are you asking permission?
[17:28:34] <jak2000> i now want display (substract 1 month) from now....
[17:28:45] <jak2000> testing
[17:28:47] <jak2000> again
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you subtracting a month?
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> is this apart of a user interaction?
[17:29:59] <jak2000> i display 2 dates
[17:30:04] <jak2000> date_start and date_end
[17:30:09] <jak2000> date_end is the actual date
[17:30:17] <jak2000> and date_Start 1 month before
[17:30:36] <jak2000> only for display only only 1 mont of data if user change it to more or less... its ok..
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/19965131/923919
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, what you had is fine.
[17:31:00] <robertmaxrees> just gotta call the formatter thinger on moment.
[17:31:32] <jak2000> ok thanks
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> though tbh your backend should be doing the date math and then you just init them without doing this all via js :)
[17:57:04] <WhirledPress> How does one get the value in pixels of the css line-height property?
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/t0yazzxz/
[17:58:38] <robertmaxrees> or https://jsfiddle.net/t0yazzxz/1/ WhirledPress
[17:59:42] <WhirledPress> so I'd just use parseFloat() to get that to a number?
[17:59:58] <WhirledPress> btw, thanks for the help.
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, parsefloat
[18:00:44] <WhirledPress> that's what I was messing up. Thanks.
[18:01:38] <robertmaxrees> rad
