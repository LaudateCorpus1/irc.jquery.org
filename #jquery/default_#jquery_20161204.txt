[05:51:21] <alexbodn> hello friends,
[05:51:21] <alexbodn> i'm happily using jquery with validate on our site's registration form.
[05:51:21] <alexbodn> on a new design with bootstrap and xhtml5 the validation is being performed, but the submitHandler does not fire.
[05:51:21] <alexbodn> any clue how to find the problem?
[05:51:21] <alexbodn> thanks in advance
[07:59:08] <alexbodn> well, it was about some exceptions due to missing variables, that should have been ported from the previous site.
[07:59:09] <alexbodn> thanks anyway.
[09:30:10] <roadrunneratwast> Is anyone familiar with using require within wordpress.  It is choking on anonymous defines() and spits out the entirety of the jquery file.  This is what I have so far  https://github.com/mcverter/buoy/blob/develop/includes/js-alert/app.js
[09:30:21] <roadrunneratwast> I have attempted to put jquery in numerous positions
[09:33:33] <sillyslux> roadrunneratwast, qswz has sent you here, but i'd forward you further down the road... to... #wordpress
[09:33:48] <roadrunneratwast> nobody is ever on wordpress
[09:34:01] <sillyslux> you have to wait
[09:34:19] <sillyslux> depending on the channel, it can take hours to get an answer
[12:38:03] <roadrunneratwast> hi all .  require js is dumping out jquery on the console errror.  'mismatched anonymouse define" ...
[12:42:39] <alexbodn> bye everybody

[15:46:05] <printForever> How can I compare multiple paths window.location.pathname?
[15:46:14] <printForever> Do I need to use an array?
[15:46:59] <printForever> I would like to run the script on pages domain.com/buy, domain.com/contact, domain.com/new, domain.com/work
[15:47:32] <printForever> I thought to create var checkPaths = [buy, contact, new, work]
[15:48:46] <printForever> and compare them in an if ( $(checkPaths).exits... )
[15:49:05] <printForever> Is it doable?

[18:05:40] <wwspider> I need to implement image crop ( like for uploading profile picture ), it has to work with all browsers, safari, opera, firefox, chrome, ie..
[18:05:58] <wwspider> before just choosing one way and doing it I wanted to ask here
[18:53:44] <carpii> is there any way to make a jQuery UI select pop 'upwards' when its close to the bottom of the viewport? Right now the popup just gets clipped by the browser viewport so its not acting much like a native select
[19:03:28] <solice> yeah dont use jquery ui
[19:03:37] <solice> if you can, its rubbish
[19:03:45] <solice> there is no silver bullet but https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/ is good
[19:04:37] <solice> carpii im pretty sure jquery ui is not very good on mobile either
[19:11:13] <Sayona>  have a nice day ! see ya
