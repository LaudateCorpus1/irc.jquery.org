[14:35:36] <Sam____> Hi
[14:36:31] <Sam____> Heloo
[15:32:00] <udn> hi guys
[15:32:06] <udn> how are you doing?
[15:32:11] <udn> can you helpme with this please
[15:32:12] <udn> https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/XOdmXO
[15:32:37] <udn> i need when you select a language redirect to specified url
[15:36:27] <cannap> why are you generating the html with js?
[15:37:08] <udn> it is by for have custom styles
[15:37:14] <cannap> o_O
[15:37:24] <cannap> just change the class instead of generating the whole select
[15:37:39] <cannap> but yea i dont know the whole goal
[15:38:03] <cannap> ah nvm no i understand
[15:38:07] <cannap> now
[15:38:51] <udn> ok thank you
[15:39:01] <cannap> look the problem is here $('.select-options').on('change',
[15:39:12] <cannap> you dont have the change option anymore
[15:39:19] <cannap> because you use now ul > li
[15:39:30] <cannap> now you need to add a click event to each li
[15:40:17] <cannap> nvm
[15:40:18] <cannap> sty
[15:40:22] <cannap> i should read the whole code xD
[15:41:16] <cannap> but any way why you still want the select working in the background
[15:41:31] <cannap> when you have server side rendering then i would understand
[15:41:34] <cannap> but other wise not
[15:49:40] <udn> thsnks :D
[15:56:28] <udn> hey cannap
[15:56:31] <udn> now works : https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/QYNyGR
[15:56:37] <udn> it is not so elegant like first
[15:56:38] <udn> but works
[16:03:37] <cannap> thats not the same result xD
[16:03:47] <cannap> i know what you you want ul li because you can style it like you want
[16:03:59] <cannap> but you need to change the language just on the clickt event instead of the change event
[16:08:24] <udn> nothing append
[16:08:27] <udn> https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/XOdmXO
[16:10:51] <cannap> wait give me asecond
[16:12:13] <udn> ok
[16:22:54] <cannap> https://codepen.io/cannap/pen/qgZboP
[16:23:15] <cannap> i forgot jquery sry xD
[16:24:21] <cannap> press f5
[16:29:47] <udn> this is really cool
[16:29:51] <udn> thank you so much cannap
[16:29:59] <udn> if you have some issue in css i can help you with it
[16:33:54] <cannap> ok thanks but check line 23 and and 42 43
[16:34:03] <cannap> maybe you can change data-value to data-url
[16:34:32] <cannap> <cannap> wait give me asecond
[16:34:44] <cannap> easier to understand
[16:45:53] <udn> ok
