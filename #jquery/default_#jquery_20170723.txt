[17:06:29] <neo_> hi guys!
[17:06:37] <neo_> I need make sqroll on jquery
[17:06:41] <neo_> have code https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/MvWadB

[17:07:23] <neo_> how to do scrill ?
[17:07:41] <neo_> I before did it once and forgot how I did it :(
[17:19:53] <neo_> why this code doesn't scroll to bottom ? https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/MvWadB
[17:20:11] <neo_> it must work and its doesn't :(
[17:21:30] <da_wunder> if that must work, then what is the issue ?
[17:22:38] <neo_> I guessed why it doesn't work
[17:22:51] <neo_> da_wunder, to try now , I done this https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/MvWadB
[17:23:10] <neo_> da_wunder, click on button
[17:24:14] <da_wunder> neo_: try to use $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: destination}, 2000);
[17:24:56] <neo_> it's for any browsers ? I tried used html and with doesn't work , ok to try now
[17:25:17] <neo_> yes work
[17:25:46] <neo_> it's my snippet , if will need again scroll I will look there
[17:29:42] <neo_> I need do that without jQuery :(
[17:29:48] <neo_> da_wunder,
[17:29:57] <neo_> need without jQuery
[17:30:04] <neo_> I forgot just
[17:30:19] <da_wunder> neo_: your example was using jquery
[17:31:22] <neo_> da_wunder, yes, but there in site jquery can include in bottom site and this code will placed in middle page . I need do it without jQuery , Just there will load page with ajax
[17:31:29] <neo_> this code will load with ajax
[17:31:36] <neo_> how I can check
[17:31:47] <neo_> or can check some id in the page always
[17:32:04] <da_wunder> neo_: then maybe #javascript is correct channel to ask that
[17:32:36] <neo_> javascript need to be registered or I don't know , can't join there
[17:32:59] <da_wunder> ... /join #somechannel
[17:33:04] <neo_> da_wunder, do you know how check elements inside container always ?
[17:33:26] <da_wunder> neo_: personally haven't used jquery in years
[17:33:49] <neo_> da_wunder, I can use jQuery, just need always check container and if there will determined id I can use this scroll function
[17:33:54] <neo_> why ?
[17:34:02] <da_wunder> no need for that
[17:34:14] <neo_> da_wunder, and what you used ?
[17:34:41] <neo_> da_wunder, jQuery is powerful tool :) I want learn it more deep
[17:35:29] <neo_> da_wunder, I for this year made much code using jQuery
[17:35:43] <neo_> da_qunder, do you think can use event change on div block ?
[17:36:00] <da_wunder> neo_: sure it's usefull, no arguee with that
[17:36:21] <neo_> now to try do it , and if there will appeared my container I will run scroll
[17:36:33] <neo_> da_wunder and what you use instead ?
[17:36:43] <neo_> da_wunder, php ?
[17:36:45] <da_wunder> neo_: for several years i have done frontend side with spa eg. angularjs, angular, vue.js, etc
[17:37:09] <da_wunder> neo_: php is backend language not frontend language
[17:37:18] <neo_> I never encountered with other libs beside jQuery
[17:37:42] <neo_> da_wunder, and you always use only backend ?
[17:37:45] <da_wunder> neo_: eg. async.js, lodash, underscore
[17:37:57] <neo_> frontend*
[17:38:15] <neo_> you front end developer ?
[17:38:27] <da_wunder> neo_: nope have done years with totally separated back- and frontend sides
[17:38:48] <da_wunder> neo_: both + more, so devops is maybe the correct term
[17:38:59] <neo_> I used only recent jQuery and its very useful and powerful lib
[17:39:18] <da_wunder> sure it's, i'm not saying it's not
[17:39:22] <neo_> jQuery amply for many tasks
[17:39:30] <da_wunder> just i haven't used that in years
[17:39:56] <da_wunder> neo_: you know eg lodash / undescore ?
[17:40:03] <da_wunder> or async.js ?
[17:40:13] <neo_> da_wunder, you can use many any plugins and don't need even to do something oneself , use prepared solution :)
[17:40:37] <neo_> no , don't used ever
[17:40:45] <da_wunder> neo_: still i think that i'm not going to back and start used jquery
[17:41:36] <neo_> I going, I downloaded book 1000 pages about jQuery will read and improving English
[17:41:57] <neo_> kill two birds with one stone :)
[17:42:13] <da_wunder> ok, good luck
[17:42:28] <neo_> da_wunder, there two books one about jQuery and one about javascript , I still did not read any book about this
[17:42:58] <neo_> da_wunder, watched video lessons only , and now want read
[17:43:19] <da_wunder> neo_: i think there is thousands of those books
[17:43:32] <neo_> da_wunder, but I need learn other theme, what do you think about SVG ? ? ?
[17:44:01] <neo_> da_wunder, yes, but I know jQuery , and bad know html css SVG
[17:44:11] <da_wunder> neo_: not in my scope atm, we use different tech stack to build graphs
[17:44:11] <neo_> SVG is powerful thing
[17:44:38] <neo_> da_wunder, can build good animations with it
[17:44:59] <da_wunder> and again we use different tech stack for those
[17:45:12] <neo_> good
[17:45:47] <neo_> I will read better about SVG or dont' know , those book about javascript and jQuery so big ....
[17:46:06] <neo_> 1 000 pages ... after that my English increased 100%
[17:46:22] <da_wunder> neo_: maybe you should also learn about typescript
[17:46:29] <neo_> what is this ?
[17:46:38] <neo_> I think read about php too
[17:47:02] <neo_> but more about html and css , this is my bottleneck )
[17:47:05] <da_wunder> i think that you can make google requests by yourself
[17:47:14] <neo_> da_wunder, html and css is my bottleneck )))
[17:47:29] <da_wunder> and no css, use scss / sass / less
[17:47:32] <neo_> da_wunder, yes I do it many
[17:47:46] <neo_> what means scss ?
[17:47:54] <da_wunder> i think that you can make google requests by yourself
[17:48:11] * da_wunder thinking to add neo_ to ignore list
[17:48:16] <neo_> no , don't want use less , I don't need this , can easy overwrite any existing rules without less
[17:48:48] <neo_> less dont need exactly , I read about it when tried used bootstrap
[17:48:56] <neo_> da_wunder, I know bootstrap )
[17:49:21] <neo_> used it a few times
[17:49:24] <da_wunder> neo_: ok you're on my ignore list
[17:49:31] <neo_> ok
[17:49:35] <da_wunder> neo_: have a nice day
[17:49:44] <neo_> da_wunder, I need also to be busy now :)
[18:57:34] <Evidlo> what's the design rationale behind .inArray not returning a boolean?
[18:58:48] <Evidlo> .inArray should be called something like .findItem().  The name inArray implies a boolean return vaue
[19:03:06] <snover> Evidlo: then don’t use it. the only thing inArray does that Array#indexOf does not is allow you to pass null/undefined as the array. otherwise it is exactly the same as calling indexOf.
[19:36:31] <Evidlo> these conventions are nonsensical
[21:33:14] <sms> What would be the best way to select the next choice in a select list?
[21:33:41] <sms> I was thinking put everything in an array, which is the most obvious, but also seems cumbersome
[21:38:33] <sms> Nevermind...I messed something up when trying to use next()
