[00:01:44] <juboba> ravenzz, yes, I'm building an example
[00:02:13] <ravenzz> cool
[00:03:44] <juboba> ravenzz,  http://jsfiddle.net/jmCxL/
[00:04:23] <juboba> ravenzz, click on the div many times fast and you'll see that the effect queues
[00:04:44] <juboba> I want the effect to take place only if you clicked on it while not bouncing
[00:04:45] <ravenzz> sure
[00:06:11] <ravenzz> juboba try $(this).clearQueue().effect()
[00:06:30] <ravenzz> although it is not exactly what you are asking
[00:07:30] <juboba> mmm
[00:07:58] <ravenzz> oh seems like that jQuery UI's effect() has a queue option
[00:08:57] <juboba> ohh l'll check
[00:09:39] <ravenzz> http://api.jqueryui.com/effect/
[00:12:52] <ravenzz> juboba otherwise you could try something like this [09:11] * Quits: phantomcircuit (~phantomci@covertinferno.org) (*.net *.split)
[00:12:52] <ravenzz> [09:11] * Quits: rmurphey (~rmurphey@hattusa.outer.org) (*.net *.split)
[00:12:52] <ravenzz> [09:11] * Conti_ is now known as Conti
[00:12:52] <ravenzz> [09:11] * Joins: shennyg (uid4021@gateway/w
[00:12:58] <ravenzz> oops
[00:13:10] <ravenzz> juboba http://jsfiddle.net/jmCxL/1/
[00:13:10] <juboba> ???
[00:14:03] <juboba> that's it!
[00:14:05] <juboba> thanks ravenzz
[00:14:32] <ravenzz> well be aware that as it is in my example isAnimating is kind of global
[00:14:53] <ravenzz> you have to scope it properly so it will work only for the elements you are interested in
[00:17:05] <juboba> yes
[00:17:16] <juboba> I have to use one animate for each chat name

[01:24:21] <Zackko> Ok so I'm working with Wordpress's Widgets, which run off of Draggables & Sortables. The issue I have is that normally I can drag a widget around in the "sortables" container and on event: sortstop, I can grab the item's ID via ui.item[0].id, but when using connectToSortable and dragging a draggable into a sortables container, when I try to grab the item's id, it returns undefined. Does this have something to do with the "clone" setting
[01:30:18] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/33/edit (using jQuery Embedly), how do I only embed videos from YouTube and Vimeo, and not random media from random URLs? Can I use the Services API (http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/service), if so how?
[01:50:37] <funhouse> Hey there, can anyone recommend a decent audio library? http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-29/2400-year-old-wisdom-nsa-edward-snowden-and-gun-control
[01:50:40] <funhouse> whoops
[01:50:54] <funhouse> Im looking for something that I can load all my files on load and have the ability to mute/unmute all sounds.
[01:53:07] <motaka2> hello how can I find the root element of an unordered list based on teh curently clickid li ?
[02:01:11] <Stephen> motaka2: $("li").on("click", function(e) { var rootElement = $(e.target).closest("ul"); });
[02:01:38] <motaka2> Stephen: I want the root ul cause it might be deeper that 1
[02:02:00] <Stephen> Exactly, that code will do it
[02:02:09] <Stephen> Oh, you mean the topmost UL?
[02:02:30] <motaka2> Stephen: the code chooses the first ul above clicked like , I want the root ul
[02:02:37] <motaka2> Stephen: Yes
[02:02:56] <motaka2> Stephen: It is in a plugin
[02:03:26] <motaka2> $.fn.Tree = function (){....};
[02:03:54] <Stephen> motaka2: Is your tree guaranteed to never be contained in a UL?
[02:04:22] <motaka2> Stephen: I dont understand you
[02:04:24] <mekwall> anyone know how to remove a state from history via the history api?
[02:04:24] <Stephen> Or can you give me an element your rootUL would always be contained in? Even if there are multiple of them?
[02:06:36] <motaka2> Stephen: there are multiple trees in a page and i need the root of the first one
[02:06:47] <motaka2> I mean the root of the clicked one
[02:10:46] <funhouse> What sound libraries do you guys like to use?
[02:11:20] <motaka2> funhouse: ##sounds
[02:11:33] <motaka2> funhouse: just for fun
[02:14:54] <Stephen> motaka2: $("li").on("click", function(e) {  var rootElement - $(e.target).closest("ul"); while(rootElement.parent().closest("ul").length > 0) { rootElement =  rootElement.parent().closest("ul"); } });
[02:14:59] <Stephen> There you are
[02:38:32] <pawell> Hi. Is anyone willing? http://wehack.it/hackathons/54-kivy-online-hackathon :)
[02:51:20] <xinming> After ajax post, How do we extract a portion of html fragment please?
[02:51:49] <xinming> $('#container').html($(res).find('blabla').html)   <--- Am I doing right for this please?
[02:53:59] <stratoss> xinming, http://api.jquery.com/find/
[02:55:16] <xinming> stratoss: But when I use   $(res).find('#container')   I got nothing
[02:56:10] <stratoss> xinming, are you sure that you have #container in res ?
[02:57:08] <xinming> I am sure, I checked it with firebug
[02:57:18] <xinming> the problem is probably because the res contains several root elements
[02:57:39] <stratoss> you can try something like $(res).find('#container).each()
[02:57:47] <xinming> It's something like,   <a href="...">blabla</a>   <a href="...">blabla</a>     <div id="container">bleble</div>
[02:58:11] <stratoss> then you need .each() for sure ;)
[02:58:18] <stratoss> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:58:23] <xinming> the reason I got confused is .find('#container')   in console.log   returns an empty   []
[02:58:29] <xinming> Let me try again anyway
[02:59:38] <xinming> Yes, It's an empty array
[03:00:07] <xinming> I use something like  $(res).find('#container').each(function (a, b) { console.log(a); console.log(b) });
[03:00:10] <xinming> nothing printed.
[03:00:22] <grafi> paste the html oô
[03:02:13] <xinming> I think it's a bug
[03:02:22] <xinming> the find doesn't try to search the root nodes of res
[03:02:45] <xinming> if I add class to child element of the root, Then, It find it easily.
[03:03:24] <xinming> Is there any online editor?
[03:03:26] <xinming> topic
[03:03:32] <xinming> got it
[03:06:39] <stratoss> see if this would help http://jsfiddle.net/naveed_ahmad/bMfqj/
[03:08:25] <xinming> stratoss: http://jsfiddle.net/3ytp7/
[03:08:55] <xinming> So, This is not a bug?
[03:09:56] <xinming> I have an updated version.
[03:10:17] <xinming> alert($('<span id="s1"></span> <span id="s2"></span> <div id="container"><div id="child">child</div></div>').find('#container').html());     <--- This versoin returns undefined.
[03:10:35] <xinming> and the second version which tries to find the '#child' worked fine.
[03:19:18] <stratoss> xinming, its not a bug
[03:19:30] <stratoss> just change find with filter in your case and you'll get 'Text'
[03:19:47] <stratoss> http://jsfiddle.net/3ytp7/2/
[03:21:30] <stratoss> find is meant to search within set of elements, and not within string
[03:41:16] <doug65536> xinming: that should work
[03:41:33] <doug65536> stratoss: he's creating a document fragment with that string
[03:46:06] <xinming> stratoss: Thanks.
[03:54:45] <doug65536> xinming: ?
[03:55:14] <doug65536> xinming: your document fragment doesn't have a root element. find searches children
[03:56:12] <doug65536> $('<div><span id="s1"></span> <span id="s2"></span> <div id="container"><div id="child">child</div></div></div>').find('#container')
[03:56:12] <doug65536> [
[03:56:12] <doug65536> <div id=​"container">​…​</div>​
[03:56:12] <doug65536> ]
[03:57:49] <doug65536> xinming: it doesn't .find #container because it is not a child
[04:00:28] <dgx> Hey all. When submitting a form with ...onkeypress==13(enter) it does submit the form, but not with the inputs. Ideas?
[04:01:13] <doug65536> xinming: are you ignoring me?
[04:02:52] <doug65536> dgx: disabled inputs don't get sent
[04:03:06] <dgx> doug65536, let me check
[04:03:51] <dgx> Nope, no disabled on the fields
[04:04:08] <doug65536> you don't disable the in js either?
[04:04:24] <doug65536> what do you mean exactly, when you say onkeypress=13
[04:04:33] <doug65536> in a click handler you .submit() the form?
[04:04:38] <dgx> Let me give a paste, one second, please.
[04:04:39] <doug65536> er, keypress
[04:05:51] <doug65536> xinming: added you to my favorite IRC people list
[04:06:02] <dgx> doug65536, http://pastie.org/8286022 there is it
[04:06:30] <dgx> i start the page with 1 visible field, two invisible, on click i switch them and they are okay, i think
[04:07:00] <doug65536> dgx: why are you doing it the hard way?
[04:07:14] <dgx> please explain, how else could i do it ?
[04:07:15] <doug65536> dgx: isn't there a submit button?
[04:07:30] <dgx> doug65536,  its crappy manager-told-me-to-do-it stuff -_-
[04:08:05] <doug65536> dgx: you are probably submitting the wrong form. try this instead: $(this).closest('form').submit()
[04:08:35] <dgx> there is a button, but they want to swtich search/login forms -> so i switch search field(and remove submit button, because its acts as a search icon) and then display the two fields user/pass -> and submit with onkeypress==13(enter button)
[04:08:53] <dgx> also, i change the action of the form
[04:09:53] <dgx> also i dont have a submit button when the "login form" is displayed, they want it when the user presses enter -> submit the form :)
[04:09:57] <dgx> dont ask me why...
[04:10:08] <doug65536> dgx: did you see what I just suggested?
[04:10:29] <dgx> doug65536, give me a sec
[04:11:02] <dgx> yes, doesn't send the input fields again
[04:11:13] <doug65536> dgx: I know a few people that can't stand having to press anything on the keyboard :)
[04:11:26] <dgx> :)
[04:11:26] <doug65536> dgx: but I know, I'm preaching to the choir
[04:11:59] <dgx> so the form got submitted, but the fields did not
[04:12:14] <doug65536> do they have name="something" attributes?
[04:12:34] <xinming> doug65536: Sorry, I didn't ignore you, I was AFK for supper. and I don't get used to change my nick when I was AFK.
[04:13:15] <xinming> doug65536: I tried that, and later I understand that find search within child elements instead of root.
[04:14:01] <dgx> doug65536, yes, both of them have name='user_name' and name='user_password'' respectively
[04:15:33] <xinming> doug65536: And BTW, when people tries to do something the hard way, It's because they start to resolve that problem for the first time. That's what I feel, I just rewrote one of my jquery script, Which was 200 lines before, and hard coded. But after rewrite, It's more flexible and only 60 lines.
[04:15:48] <dgx> doug65536, found the problem. wtf the front-end dev. decided to put action='get' for the search form -_-;;
[04:16:16] <doug65536> bad idea
[04:17:17] <dgx> yea, i was wondering why i get ?keywords=etc.etc. in the top and im like, where does this comes from... :)
[04:27:26] <akkufomk> ^^^^
[04:28:59] <akkufomk> dgx: the question is can you do both get and post variables in the same form?
[04:29:13] <dgx> ugh..no?
[04:29:21] <akkufomk> ;)
[04:29:54] <dgx> here is the deal, when i create new forms, i always put post, just like a habit, right? i didn't even think about that someone coult pust get
[04:30:04] <dgx> could put GET*
[04:30:37] <akkufomk> yeah I guess with asp they are still in the same object
[04:30:42] <richwestcoast> can anyone suggest an ergonomic mechanical keyboard for writing java scripts
[04:30:56] <akkufomk> ooooo get the microsoft ergo keyboard 5000
[04:30:58] <akkufomk> I have one
[04:31:01] <akkufomk> it's the best!
[04:31:15] <Asmooh> use a z10 so yo can swipe all your codez up
[04:31:17] <akkufomk> soo comfortable
[04:32:12] <akkufomk> richwestcoast: this is what I use at work http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823109148&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-_-pla-_-Keyboards-_-N82E16823109148&gclid=CITO7_vKp7kCFQJBQgod0FAAqg
[04:33:04] <richwestcoast> cool thanks akkufomk
[04:33:20] <richwestcoast> is it mechanical?
[04:33:28] <akkufomk> idk what that means
[04:33:33] <richwestcoast> mechanical keys
[04:33:39] <akkufomk> all I know is it's comfortable and it's lasted almost 2 years
[04:33:47] <akkufomk> from my poundings ;)
[04:33:53] <richwestcoast> ok :)
[04:33:57] <richwestcoast> thanks
[04:34:07] <richwestcoast> i saw a keyboard - that had no letters on the keys
[04:34:12] <richwestcoast> thats taking it to another level
[04:34:13] <akkufomk> hah
[04:34:17] <akkufomk> I like doing that
[04:34:18] <richwestcoast> ill find it quick
[04:34:31] <akkufomk> my awsd keys are always bare
[04:34:58] <richwestcoast> lol
[04:35:02] <richwestcoast> but that wasnt a design choice
[04:35:03] <richwestcoast> :)
[04:36:26] <akkufomk> ahh well I don't need prints on the keyboard
[04:36:38] <akkufomk> I never really look at it
[04:37:14] <akkufomk> my ass is planted in front of it 17 hours a day we get pissed when we get in a staring contest
[04:37:23] <richwestcoast> http://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=78
[04:37:27] <richwestcoast> its the one to the right

[04:37:41] <richwestcoast> it would mess me up tho
[04:37:48] <richwestcoast> esp whent hey rearrange the letters

[04:43:58] <akkufomk> but like
[04:44:07] <akkufomk> I'll figger out what you need to code to do
[04:44:18] <akkufomk> just might take me longer than someone else
[04:44:28] <akkufomk> I'm not scurred of different languages
[04:44:53] <richwestcoast> metal head
[04:45:08] <richwestcoast> a little bit, iv got a lot of it on my playlist on all access

[04:49:55] <akkufomk> oh and bluetooth
[04:52:09] <KaitoKid> good day guys, how can I use SOAP/WSDL webservice using jQuery?
[04:52:20] <KaitoKid> an example is this one: ideone.com/api/1/service.wsdl
[04:52:40] <akkufomk> what are you trying to consume
[04:52:54] <KaitoKid> I'm trying to use their API
[04:53:18] <akkufomk> prolly best to just look at $.ajax then
[04:53:38] <akkufomk> and build your queries in a string
[04:53:45] <KaitoKid> $.ajax?
[04:54:04] <KaitoKid> can you give an example? I don't get it. :/
[04:54:15] <akkufomk> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:54:58] <KaitoKid> how can I call the WSDL using ajax?
[04:55:52] <akkufomk> you call it like you whould any normal service
[04:56:04] <akkufomk> service.wsdl/command/arg?
[04:56:24] <akkufomk> http://ideone.com/api/1/service.wsdl
[04:57:00] <akkufomk> or is it http://xxx.wsdl/web.service/command?args=
[04:57:00] <KaitoKid> hmmm. not sure..
[04:57:25] <akkufomk> idk man I normally use the microsoft api for this shit
[04:57:39] <akkufomk> their client framework
[04:57:46] <KaitoKid> I see, sorry for bothering you.
[04:58:04] <akkufomk> well lets figger this out
[04:58:22] <KaitoKid> honestly, their documentation is not well documented
[04:58:37] <KaitoKid> it lacks documentation on how to call it on different languages
[04:58:48] <KaitoKid> though they only provide the WSDL/web service
[04:59:13] <akkufomk> http://openlandscape.net/2009/09/25/call-soap-xm-web-services-with-jquery-ajax/
[04:59:17] <akkufomk> here's some info
[04:59:48] <KaitoKid> thanks, let me read it for a while.
[04:59:52] <akkufomk> http://rocky1982.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/call-soap-xml-web-services-with-jquery-ajax/
[04:59:56] <akkufomk> here's some more info
[05:09:48] <KaitoKid> hmm... seems very complicated... I think I'll be using PHP to call the web service and execute, and then I'll just make use of jQuery.post to call the function and retrieve the results without reloading the page..
[05:12:53] <akkufomk> well that's dumb
[05:13:01] <akkufomk> why create an extra step
[05:13:07] <akkufomk> just bvecause you don't understand it
[05:13:28] <akkufomk> at leaste attempt to fail
[05:13:56] <KaitoKid> uh.. sorry.. uh.. yea.. you have a point
[05:14:16] <KaitoKid> I can't learn if I don't fall right?
[05:15:14] <KaitoKid> ok then, I'll try hard on implementing this...
[05:15:36] <akkufomk> sounds like a plan brother
[05:15:53] <KaitoKid> thanks for motivating me.
[05:16:05] <akkufomk> I just hate looking at shitty code ;)
[05:16:28] <akkufomk> I mean like code is never shitty to me
[05:16:45] <akkufomk> it's just the extra process it brings where it doesn't need to be implemented at all
[05:16:58] <akkufomk> don't reinvent the wheel make it better
[05:18:16] <akkufomk> oh and listen to METAL
[05:19:34] <KaitoKid> haha, thanks, will do! :D
[05:21:35] <akkufomk> it's not really "METAL" but it's an awesome coding cd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xx1jbpY-VA
[05:24:28] <KaitoKid> nice! :D
[05:24:57] <akkufomk> yeah I love making my objects talk to eachother with this kinda stuff
[06:21:14] <ezrios> the uplink soundtrack always makes good coding music
[06:40:09] <angela_> hi, i'm having problem with a jquery drag and drop quiz

[06:40:37] <angela_> the problem is that the right side text can't be dropped into the right spot on the left
[07:00:54] <fly2web> why message is coming 'You don't have permission to access //jQuery/index.html on this server.'
[07:00:58] <fly2web> ?
[07:01:11] <fly2web> tell me why?
[07:02:35] <fly2web> 'You don'member:t have permission to access /jQuery/index.html on this server.' <---- what is message?
[07:03:13] <fly2web> 'You don'member:t have permission to access /jQuery/index.html on this server.' <-- what is message?
[07:14:04] <ezrios> fly2web: check that index.html is readable by world
[07:14:24] <fly2web> by world?
[07:14:31] <ezrios> by everyone
[07:14:40] <ezrios> as in, file permissions
[07:15:26] <fly2web> ok thanks, i just was known the folder is not permission.
[07:15:31] <fly2web> thanks ezrios
[07:43:43] <spobat> why aren't these images equally spaced http://jsfiddle.net/8F2ht/ ? There is no linebreak after one <img> but whitespaces don't matter in displaying, right?
[08:01:12] <shoky> spobat: the space matters between inline elements (whether there is space or not). you dont have any space between the first </a> and the following <a>
[08:01:41] <spobat> shoky: alright! thank you :)
[08:02:22] <lukissimo81> hi
[08:02:43] <xinming> How do I append some args to the submit before the form submission please? I mean the right way.
[08:03:02] <lukissimo81> help me thumbtray jquery?
[08:03:12] <xinming> for now, What I do is in submit handler, before submit, I create some hidden fields with value I want and return true in the submit handler.
[08:03:18] <xinming> I don't feel very natural to do this.
[08:03:23] <xinming> Anyone would give me some hints?
[08:03:52] <lukissimo81> info hide and show on the thumbtray
[08:07:13] <shoky> xinming: another option is to post the form with ajax, then you can build the data yourself, with e.g. .serializeArray()
[08:09:01] <xinming> shoky: Ok, Thanks, It seems I have no choice to choose submit
[08:09:05] <xinming> to create hidden input
[08:18:39] <Doomground> is it somehow possible to get browser viewport heigh? $(window).height(), $(document).height(), $(window.top).height()  all return 32340px which is most certanly not browser window size
[08:24:35] <kastang> Doomground: if you dont mind dropping down to Javascript you can use window.innerHeight instead of a jQuery function.
[08:24:58] <Doomground> mh
[08:25:08] <Doomground> that actually returns what i expect
[08:25:14] <Doomground> thank you kastang
[08:25:22] <Doomground> i wonder why jQuery doesn't offer this value though?
[08:56:17] <hemangpatel> Hello guys
[08:56:39] <hemangpatel> Can i open custom popup on beforeunload event of jquery ?
[09:07:44] <hemangpatel> anyone ?
[09:51:42] <spobat> hey
[09:51:46] <spobat> can we optimize this? submitAsideRight.css('position', 'absolute').css('left', '605px');
[09:54:35] <spobat> css({'position': 'absolute', 'left': '605px'});
[09:54:36] <spobat> ty
[09:54:39] <spobat> np
[10:21:31] <gvdm> can anybody think of why an HTTP response can be ok (200) head have an empty body, only when getting via jquery, the same get request as a curl works, or simply in the browser
[10:59:47] <mg983> Hey guys
[10:59:54] <mg983> how can I tell if an element's CSS is set to height:auto?
[11:00:04] <mg983> $element.css('height'); returns the actual height
[11:04:41] <sweb> how can i select $('element').hasNotClass('blahblah');
[11:31:21] <lord4163> sweb: huh?
[12:46:54] <gvdm> can anybody think of why an HTTP response can be ok (200) yet have an empty body but only when getting via jquery.
[12:46:56] <gvdm> the same get request as a curl works, or simply in the browser
[12:47:07] <gvdm> I think it may have to do with the fact that these are on seperate domains
[12:47:33] <gvdm> this worked in firefox 22 but seems to have stopped working in 23
[12:48:40] <Ansikt> That's very weird.  You should be getting an error if it's a CORS problem
[12:49:35] <Ansikt> My thought is that it might have something to do with the way you're parsing the data?  Just curious if you have any code to look at?
[13:02:06] <gvdm> Ansikt: you can check on http://beta.wildearth.tv/cam/petes-pond it shows up in the firebug console
[13:03:12] <Ansikt> holy crap!  I'm the 100,000th visitor!
[13:03:52] <Ansikt> gvdm:  are you trying thttp://control.wildearth.tv/cached_getviews_ppm-cam-01.streamo load:
[13:03:53] <Ansikt> ?
[13:11:53] <gvdm> Ansikt: that's the one
[13:12:33] <Ansikt> I'm getting it blocked for XHR on Chrome.  Don't know why it worked before though.
[13:13:15] <gvdm> how do I work around it?
[13:14:58] <Ansikt> Well, pretty much you can't.  What are you trying to accomplish?
[13:15:08] <gvdm> get data, display it
[13:15:38] <Ansikt> One common way is to have your server (beta.wildearth.server) request that data, then just request it from there
[13:15:52] <Ansikt> That's really the only way that has good support.
[13:16:15] <Ansikt> beta.wildearth.tv I mean
[13:16:32] <gvdm> right
[13:16:37] <gvdm> this sucks
[13:17:13] <Ansikt> Well, there is another way.
[13:17:28] <gvdm> hrmm?
[13:17:31] <gvdm> all ears
[13:18:48] <Ansikt> Build that page as an html document and have that value as the content of a hidden input or a span or script tag or whatever.  Then set document.domain of both to be wildearth.tv
[13:19:24] <Ansikt> Otherwise, there's a few more options if you're willing to sacrifice browser compatability.
[13:20:16] <Ansikt> There's a header (forget the name of it) which allows you to request from whatever domain you want
[13:21:12] <Ansikt> This will fix your problem instantly, if you're okay with the support chart at the top
[13:21:12] <Ansikt> http://enable-cors.org/client.html
[13:21:16] <Ansikt> gvdm ^^
[13:22:18] <gvdm> ok, lemme check that out
[13:23:29] <Ansikt> Oh, what I meant to say about my first solution was that both documents should be in iframes - so long as document.domain is the same, you can read/execute scripts/query dom/whatever between the,
[13:27:41] <gvdm> Ansikt: CORS looks to be the sensible solution as we can set that header

[15:37:52] <Bish> hey guys im writing a plugin for facebook, can someone tell me how i can detect page changes.. which look like real pagechanges, but are not happening? they're no hashchanges so i cannot use that event
[15:38:49] <Bish> https://www.facebook.com/me/friends_all like this one... if you click on one category of friends, it will change the url, but won't load the complete page, therefore it's loading it with ajax
[15:40:26] <tw2113> maybe utilize the html5 history api?
[15:41:43] <Bish> tw2113, i tried onpopstate if you were refering to taht
[15:43:12] <tw2113> dunno for sure, i've never really looked much at the history api, but know it exists
[15:54:46] <Bish> onpopstate sadly does not work for me
[15:56:05] <Bish> would be a shame if i had to do a mainloop to get the pagechange
[16:04:07] <Bish> i would be grateful if someone could tell me how to detect such a pagechange
[16:04:41] <Serpiente> I am searching a plugin to lock the scroll event on a div - prevent the window from scrolling if the scrollbar is at the bottom of the scrollable div
[16:55:42] <cam> How do I use an element passed to a function (such as `this`) to find elements only within `this`s parents.

[17:01:41] <Tingle> Hi, could someone tell me what is wrong witht his? console.log($("option[name='English']").data('value')); it keeps printing undefined. basicly Im trying to find this: <option name="English" value="en">English</option> which is in a selcet form
[17:02:10] <d3adman87> console.log($("option[name='English']").attr('value'));
[17:02:14] <d3adman87> :)
[17:02:38] <Tingle> ah
[17:02:41] <Tingle> awesome
[17:02:41] <Tingle> thanks
[17:03:17] <d3adman87> you're welcome :) read this just to get better context on attr: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:07:13] <d3adman87> Question about jquerymobile: I have two files, index.html and balance.html. balance.html is linked from index.html in a listview. When I click/touch on the balance.html link, it loads fine. I want to dynamically inject some json data into balance.html before showing it. calling $.getJSON inside beforechangepage event handler still shows balance.html and stays incomplete until getJSON completes. which is annoying
[17:07:18] <d3adman87> someone help please :)
[17:08:03] <d3adman87> I just want to show a spinner upon touching/clicking, prep the page with some data from getJSON and then show it.
[17:08:22] <d3adman87> and hide the spinner ofcourse
[17:10:39] <d3adman87> anyone?
[17:13:35] <CWSpear> I haven't used jQuery Mobile a ton, partly because I was frustrated by a lot of the routing stuff
[17:13:38] <CWSpear> @d3adman87
[17:13:58] <CWSpear> I am not sure that waiting for a resolution like that is possible.
[17:14:17] <d3adman87> hmm...
[17:14:44] <d3adman87> I really like jquery mobile. It's just things like these that annoy me. Apparently what I want works in version 1.0rc1
[17:14:45] <d3adman87> lol
[17:15:04] <CWSpear> I know AngularJS has a resolve mechanic that is supposed to work like you describe, but it's poorly documented and a little buggy
[17:15:08] <d3adman87> there's an example at some blog that does exactly this!
[17:15:44] <d3adman87> My last resort is using backbone router and handcode all page loads
[17:16:01] <d3adman87> still using jquery mobile widgets
[17:17:30] <CWSpear> d3adman87, http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html
[17:17:41] <CWSpear> so use the pagebeforeload with the deferred object
[17:18:33] <CWSpear> looks like you call event.preventDefault() with that event, and then do you getJSON stuff and then call data.deferred.resolve()
[17:18:49] <d3adman87> tried that. Problem there is that the page that I want to manipulate isn't loaded into the DOM yet
[17:19:36] <CWSpear> You want to manipulate the DOM in the page with data form getJSON?
[17:19:39] <d3adman87> The right place is after page-load and before transition.. and calling preventDefault() inside beforechangepage doesnt stop the transition
[17:19:46] <d3adman87> yes CWSpear
[17:20:06] <d3adman87> but before the transition happens
[17:20:18] <CWSpear> In the documentation, I don't understand what the "// ... load the document then insert it into the DOM ...
[17:20:18] <CWSpear> " part means
[17:20:19] <mehwork> anyone know why .getScript(urlOnSameDomain) loads the javascript (e.g., will show an alert() if there was one) but doesn't add any elements to the DOM?
[17:21:14] <d3adman87> CWSpear: I see that they mean
[17:21:22] <d3adman87> basically the way I see it, I will need two ajax calls
[17:21:29] <d3adman87> one to load the page, one to get json data..
[17:21:47] <CWSpear> d3adman87, yeah, it looks like it expects you to load the page yourself, so then you'd have the HTML, you can manipulate it, and then pass it into data.deferred.resolve
[17:22:03] <d3adman87> hmm.. makes sense
[17:22:18] <d3adman87> although lots of spaghetti cooking. lol
[17:22:25] <d3adman87> let me give it a shot..
[17:23:02] <d3adman87> all I want is jquery mobile do its thing up until transition and hand over the dom to me
[17:23:08] <CWSpear> I've had lots more success with this sort of thing with Angular
[17:23:42] <CWSpear> It's built more declaratively with this sort of thing in mind. When I build mobile apps, I use Angular now (after bad experiences with jQueryMobile)
[17:24:05] <d3adman87> what do you use for the frontend? or is it all handcoded?
[17:24:14] <d3adman87> im not the brightest CSS guy in town I guess
[17:24:31] <CWSpear> What do you mean?
[17:24:59] <d3adman87> I mean, with jquery mobile, I only care about the html, which is generally semantic
[17:25:21] <d3adman87> and jqm automagically applies all styles, etc to the markup
[17:26:20] <CWSpear> Angular is a JavaScript library. You would use it in place of jQM, and in most cases, in place of jQuery. But yeah, for most of the stylings, I just handcode it. Gives us more control over the styles.
[17:26:28] <CWSpear> Better for the things I do.
[17:26:55] <CWSpear> I've gotta head out. Good luck.
[17:27:03] <d3adman87> Thanks man
[17:27:06] <d3adman87> ;)
[17:58:19] <ekkis> afternoon everyone.  I've written something and would like to make a request for comments.  see here: http://pastebin.com/B0hsFHVs
[17:58:38] <ekkis> specifically, I'm wondering where would be a good place to publish this and what to name it
[18:01:16] <Serpiente> anyone here using jQuery waypoints? is it possible to use it on a div with a fixed height and scrollbars, and as soon as the waypoint element get's in sight trigger the action?
[18:07:31] <ekkis> Serpiente: I've never used them but I was just looking at docs on them
[18:07:54] <Serpiente> ekkis: I guess I found it, there's a context setting
[18:08:16] <ekkis> ah
[18:08:34] <ekkis> cool kitten uses them, which I'm looking to implement
[18:54:02] <inthl> I have 3 divs, all surrounded by one <form> - these divs all do contain input fields, is it somehow possible using jquery to say e.g. submitt all forms except those in div2 and div3 when submitting that form?
[18:54:27] <inthl> or submit all except div1 and div3, and so on..
[19:00:24] <codepodu> inthl: disable all fields in a certain div, they won't be submitted
[19:01:10] <codepodu> inthl: $('input, textarea, select', '.div2').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[19:03:00] <inthl> thank you, didn't know that disabled inputs are not being submitted :>
[19:03:21] <codepodu> :)
[19:45:37] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to pass an array of deferreds to $.when() instead of as separate arguments?
[19:48:50] <timwis> n/m, using .apply()
[23:37:55] <tieTYT> hi
[23:38:28] <ph88> hi
[23:38:51] <tieTYT> i'm building a game and I'm using jquery and html for the GUI
[23:39:21] <ph88> nice
[23:39:48] <tieTYT> and I keep on running into this problem: There's a js function that is called goToDialog, that function body hides all dialogs but the one you're going to, then it adds on("click"...) handlers to the elements that are visible
[23:40:15] <tieTYT> the problem is, if you visit the dialog twice, it appears that jquery adds a new handler on all the elements so now it'll react to click twice per click
[23:40:23] <tieTYT> and then the next time I visi, 3 times per click
[23:40:34] <tieTYT> how am I supposed to avoid this?
[23:40:48] <tieTYT> i don't want to double my handler code to always remove then add the handler
[23:41:17] <pixelpimp> just sounds like bad logic
[23:41:32] <tieTYT> how so?
[23:42:50] <mindtwitch> #unity3d
[23:42:58] <pixelpimp> sounds like you're adding your handler in the wrong spot
[23:43:07] <pixelpimp> just add it once
[23:43:42] <pixelpimp> no need to keep adding/removing handlers, is there?  You're hiding the elements, so the click handlers won't get called.
[23:43:45] <tieTYT> how can I do that when the content of the dialog is dynamic
[23:44:06] <tieTYT> I can't know at the beginning all the elements that will require click handlers
[23:44:16] <tieTYT> because they don't exist yet
[23:44:21] <codepodu> when the dialog disappears, remove the elements.
[23:44:22] <ph88> the handler is on the dialog itself, not on it's content, isn't it ?
[23:44:31] <codepodu> don't just hide it
[23:44:47] <tieTYT> ph88: it's on the content
[23:44:58] <codepodu> call .remove() on the content
[23:45:22] <tieTYT> codepodu: but if I do that, that means I'll basically have no html in my html file, right?  I'd have to generate every part of the dialog in jquery?
[23:45:38] <codepodu> you just said the content is dynamic
[23:45:48] <tieTYT> some of it is, some of is isn't
[23:45:58] <tieTYT> for example, the inventory dialog always has a back button, that's static
[23:46:22] <tieTYT> but the inventory size may grow or shrink depending on your game state
[23:46:40] <tieTYT> but each cell needs to react to a click for a delete dialog and stuff
[23:47:39] <tieTYT> and the div that contains the inventory cells is static.  It's just that I dynamically add the cells
[23:47:56] <ph88> tieTYT: have a boolean in your goToDialog function to check if the dialog was already initialized or not
[23:48:30] <pixelpimp> perhaps some more details on what you need to do would be nice
[23:48:37] <pixelpimp> you might be trying to solve something the wrong way
[23:48:55] <tieTYT> ph88: well if you visit the inventory later and you now have more space in your inventory, how do I make sure those new cells get on click events?
[23:49:11] <codepodu> if you feel you're writing lots of spaghetti jquery, you should switch to a nice framework. backbone works.
[23:50:00] <ph88> tieTYT: either you keep track of which elemnts you are adding and add click handlers at those ... or you remove and rebuild everything
[23:50:03] <tieTYT> the jquery doesn't seem that bad to me (though it's probably not idiomatic)
[23:50:52] <tieTYT> ph88: what about this: $("#dialogId").contents().off()
[23:51:34] <ph88> tieTYT: you can make a test case of that, then you know, and we can take a look at it
[23:52:14] <ph88> doens't sound like a good idea though
[23:52:50] <ph88> it's better if you put the elements which are clickable in an array and then for the entire array on each element do .off()
[23:53:18] <ph88> i wouldn't do it like this, take the suggestion at :49
[23:53:42] <tieTYT> hm ok
