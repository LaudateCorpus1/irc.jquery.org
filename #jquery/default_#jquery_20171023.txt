[00:10:59] <madprops> hi
[00:11:15] <madprops> Trying to add two jquery objects with .add https://paste.ee/p/jdC3K
[00:11:24] <madprops> doesn't seem to work
[00:11:40] <madprops> I add them in line 37
[00:15:36] <madprops> oh wait
[00:15:39] <madprops> i think it's working
[00:15:42] <madprops> but something's wrong
[02:07:18] <SlizardWizard> is there a reason jQuery.extend won't move methods over? only properties

[03:07:05] <Neo1> hi guys
[03:07:34] <Neo1> can I use socket.io on ordinary php server?
[03:07:42] <Neo1> Cork: ???
[03:08:15] <Cork> Neo1: not that i know, php doesn't have a way to keep a constant connection to users
[03:08:39] <Neo1> it's need server with nodejs?
[03:08:57] <rabidus> Cork: what?
[03:09:02] <Cork> nodejs, python, go, rust i know of
[03:09:14] <Woet> Neo1: you of course googled "php socket.io" right?
[03:09:19] <Neo1> and do you know how many users can be simultaneously on that site?
[03:09:38] <Woet> google supports lot of simultaneous users.
[03:09:39] <Neo1> Woet: no I mean about this https://socket.io/
[03:09:48] <Woet> Neo1: yes, I'm aware.
[03:10:06] <Cork> a wait... socket.io... throught about websocket -_-'
[03:10:20] <Cork> Neo1: socket.io is comet based so it works just fine with php
[03:10:51] <Cork> Neo1: the max number of user is limited by the server load not really by the system
[03:10:54] <Neo1> and will my chat hold simultaneously 3000 users? I want create big USA chat or american where rooms are states, will 40 rooms, I seem there will many users
[03:11:10] <Cork> Neo1: depends on how beefy the server is :)
[03:11:14] <rabidus> easily
[03:11:21] <Cork> i wouldn't expect that to work on a shared hosting though
[03:11:31] <Woet> Neo1: start worrying about that once you have more than 10.
[03:11:40] <Neo1> ordinary server
[03:11:45] <Neo1> Woet: ok )
[03:12:00] <Neo1> Woet: I didn't see any USA chats
[03:12:13] <Neo1> I will do it first, I think it's will very popular
[03:12:26] <Neo1> :)
[03:12:27] <Woet> yea definitely found a gap in the market
[03:12:34] <Cork> Neo1: but if you want to plan for loads like that i wouldn't write the server code in php
[03:12:53] <Neo1> Cork: what does it means?
[03:12:55] <Cork> (or any interpreted language at all actually)
[03:13:27] <Neo1> Cork: socket.io is use nodejs? I've heard it work very fast
[03:13:27] <Cork> Neo1: that if you actually expect to get to 3000 concurent users you should prob plan to use a more efficient langauge
[03:13:37] <Cork> Neo1: it doesn't
[03:13:40] <Cork> it CAN use
[03:13:52] <Cork> and nodejs isn't very efficient
[03:14:01] <Cork> heck it is even worse then rails
[03:15:02] <Neo1> Cork: no, it doesn't have sense, enough interpreted language. Doing that using bear code senseless
[03:15:27] <Cork> uh, what?
[03:15:56] <Neo1> Cork: ok, and you know can turn on nodejs on usuall php server (VPN) for 3$ ?
[03:16:24] <Neo1> Cork: I mean php is suitable for this aims
[03:16:25] <Cork> nodejs is a server you can't run it in php
[03:16:40] <Neo1> really?
[03:16:51] <Neo1> in  my comp I can run it?
[03:17:13] <Cork> ...
[03:17:17] <Neo1> I though it is working on server also like in my desktop
[03:17:29] <Cork> php isn't a server -_-'''
[03:17:37] <Woet> yea this guy is definitely going to own the chat market
[03:17:43] <Cork> ya...
[03:18:03] <Neo1> yes build my own world chat )
[03:18:03] <Woet> pretty sure he's been working on this for at least 3-4 weeks at this point
[03:18:32] <Neo1> Cork: hey but if nodejs is server, where I will place php files?
[03:18:54] <Woet> Neo1: why dont you sit back and read on what socket.io, nodejs and PHP actually are?
[03:18:58] <Neo1> socket.io use php or nodejs?
[03:18:58] <Cork> Neo1: are you pulling my leg or are you seriously asking that?
[03:19:40] <Neo1> ok, I will silence
[03:20:18] <Cork> Neo1: socket.io is a protocol library, it can use what ever server language has implemented support for it
[03:20:22] <Neo1> seriously, I though nodjs work on php server and I can use it on any server...
[03:20:31] <Cork> and nodejs is a server, while php is a language so...
[03:20:44] <Cork> your mixing things in a very weird way
[03:20:53] <Woet> > your
[03:20:55] * Woet stares
[03:21:09] <Cork> you're *
[03:21:10] <Neo1> Cork: and when I will use socket.io I cant pug my site on any server only which support nodejs?
[03:21:25] <Cork> no
[03:21:31] <Cork> it has nothing to do with that
[03:21:35] <Neo1> Cork: see this site use socket.io, need to analize it https://csgo-gg-wp.ru/
[03:21:40] <Woet> lmao
[03:21:49] <Woet> [09:18:54]  <Woet>	Neo1: why dont you sit back and read on what socket.io, nodejs and PHP actually are?
[03:23:02] <Cork> Neo1: nodejs is a server roughly similar to apache, it uses the language javascript, not php
[03:23:25] <Cork> socket.io is a network communication protocol it has nothing to do with nodejs or php
[03:23:35] <Cork> so ya, read up on it if you plan to use it
[03:23:39] <Neo1> look at this http://prntscr.com/h0sp1b
[03:23:54] <Neo1> that site is using nodejs and socket.io
[03:24:11] <Neo1> it maybe work in couple :|
[03:24:30] <Neo1> Woet: I don't like reading
[03:24:44] <Woet> Neo1: then stop wasting our time and hire someone
[03:24:45] <Cork> when why are you in a text only communication channel?
[03:25:03] <Neo1> Woet: it's boring and I have bad English, for me it's very difficult read something in foreign language :|
[03:25:13] <Woet> Neo1: then stop wasting our time and hire someone
[03:25:20] <Neo1> Woet: I don't have money too :(
[03:25:35] <Neo1> Woet: I would hire if I can
[03:25:38] <Woet> Neo1: then make a different career choice, this is not going to work for you.
[03:26:40] <Neo1> Cork: what does that phrase mean? I didn't understand you.
[03:27:02] <Cork> it means if you don't want to read, why are you on irc?
[03:27:14] <Neo1> Woet: ok, I'm trying to learn it
[03:27:47] <Neo1> Cork: for help this is help channel. Don't it?
[03:28:10] <Cork> not if you don't want to do any leg work on learning what you are about to do no
[03:28:54] <Neo1> ok I will learn, but this is difficult for me :( I'm not native
[03:29:20] <Cork> it isn't for most ppl learning it
[03:29:30] <Woet> Neo1: neither am I.
[03:29:40] <Cork> (or i)
[03:30:11] <Neo1> ok :)
[03:33:39] <Neo1> Cork: you see on that chat php and nodejs work together though...
[03:33:53] <Neo1> seems it can work together
[03:34:20] <Cork> i never said you can't use them at the same time, but you can't run them in each other
[03:35:50] <Neo1> Cork: but you said it's server, and I though it used like php server for site :)
[03:36:03] <Neo1> ok understood
[03:36:12] <Cork> for the last time php is a language not a server
[03:36:14] <Neo1> will read documentation
[03:37:17] <Neo1> Probably for create site casino or big chat need to use nodejs
[03:37:28] <Cork> <_<'''
[03:37:31] * Cork gives up
[03:38:00] <Neo1> :)
[03:38:24] <Cork> you're not listening and you're so way off base that this is pointless
[03:39:17] <Neo1> I know basics
[03:39:23] <Cork> no you don't
[03:39:40] <Neo1> don't node js and soket.io
[03:40:01] <Neo1> I though soket.io work with php
[03:43:28] <LeGorille> can I target an input array in an $.each loop this way :   $('input[name="item[option][' + optionName + '][ttl]"]').val(optionPrice.total);
[03:43:49] <undefined_bob> at least I had fun reading that conversation
[03:44:54] <Neo1> LeGorille: no only first element, you need use .each
[03:45:45] <LeGorille> Neo1, what do you mean by only first element ?
[03:46:27] <Neo1> oh this look as something wrong syntax ( + '][ttl]"]')
[03:47:01] <Neo1> LeGorille: I mean about this $('selector').each(function(index, el){});
[03:47:29] <Neo1> LeGorille: your selector seems wrong, and you didn't use .each
[03:47:43] <LeGorille> I am using $.each
[03:47:54] <LeGorille> if I do an alert, I do have the values
[03:48:14] <LeGorille> but I need to put them in an input array
[03:48:55] <Neo1> ok, gives up
[03:49:31] <LeGorille> my inputs are named item[option][optionName][ttl] where optionName changes and is the index in the $.each loop
[03:49:34] <Neo1> in array you can put in each function, get all elements and put them in array as you need
[03:50:35] <Neo1> oh so sophisticated all
[03:51:38] <LeGorille> check this out
[03:51:39] <LeGorille>  $.each(options, function(optionsName, option) {
[03:51:40] <LeGorille>                                 $('input[name="options[option][' + optionName + '][ttl]"]').val(options.ttl)
[03:51:40] <LeGorille>                             });
[03:51:49] <Neo1> ad there ID for each input, I think for you will easier grasping data
[03:52:00] <Cork> LeGorille: please use a jsfiddle
[03:52:01] <Neo1> oh no, you need selector
[03:52:08] <LeGorille> sorry Cork
[03:52:11] <Neo1> $('selector') then 'each'
[03:52:26] <LeGorille> no I don't think I need a selector
[03:52:27] <Neo1> seems you wholly way off basic
[03:52:33] <Cork> ya, you don't
[03:52:51] <Cork> but please make an example of what you're trying to do in a jsfiddle
[03:53:08] <LeGorille> ok I will
[03:53:10] <Neo1> he is trying get all input data
[03:53:17] <Cork> no he isn't
[03:53:49] <LeGorille> Neo1, I get data from a json array, and want to place it in the approriate inputs
[03:53:59] <Neo1> LeGorille: use this $('input').each(function(index){ var data=$(this).text(); });
[03:54:28] <Cork> LeGorille: your original question sounds like it should work fine
[03:54:29] <Neo1> LeGorille: output data in console, for visually see what you getting
[03:54:41] <Cork> so if it doesn't it will be about why
[03:54:52] <LeGorille> Cork, it is working, if I do an alert I get the proper ttl
[03:55:05] <LeGorille> I just can get it in the input as new value
[03:55:13] <LeGorille> cant
[03:55:19] <Cork> ya, so try to make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[03:55:32] <Cork> cause that code should work fine
[03:55:51] <Neo1> maybe no,
[03:55:54] <LeGorille> ok I ll post the link once it's done
[03:56:07] <Neo1> LeGorille: try useing ID instead that syntax as you do
[03:56:12] <Cork> ...
[03:56:24] <Neo1> it's look not understandable what you are doing
[03:56:44] <Cork> then stop giving advice! T_T
[03:57:17] <Neo1> ok, I like teach newbie though
[03:57:23] <Neo1> :)
[03:57:23] <Cork> make sure you understand the problem before giving suggestions
[03:57:24] <undefined_bob> lol
[03:57:30] <Cork> else you're hurting more then you help
[03:57:30] <Woet> Neo1: you are the newbie.
[04:10:45] <LeGorille> hope this will give you an idea
[04:10:46] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/86kh5aLj/4/
[04:12:37] <Cork> LeGorille: it is an array of objects so optionName isn't the name
[04:13:09] <Cork> LeGorille: https://jsfiddle.net/86kh5aLj/5/
[04:13:51] <Cork> alternatively https://jsfiddle.net/86kh5aLj/6/
[04:16:59] <LeGorille> hmmm
[04:17:04] <LeGorille> thank you Cork
[04:17:08] <Cork> np
[04:52:14] <Koopz> i feel like i've just done something really dumb... $(this)[0]
[04:54:25] <Koopz> this is dumb, right?
[05:05:44] <Cork> Koopz: yes, just use this
[05:08:21] <Koopz> use what? :P
[05:09:17] <Cork> "this"
[05:09:24] <Cork> $(this)[0] === this
[05:10:55] <Koopz> boring... you leave no space for confusion

[06:33:24] <Guest59475> click to highligh and click to remove class doesn't work
[06:33:27] <Guest59475> anyone?
[06:38:16] <Neo1> Guest59475: what?
[06:55:30] <impliednude> my script uses double $$ I understand I have to convert a single $ to jQuery What about a double $$?
[06:55:43] <Cork> impliednude: from what lib?
[06:55:47] <Cork> jquery doesn't have $$
[06:57:00] <Cork> some libs use $ for id lookup and $$ for complext selectors, some use $ for id and $$ for classes and so on
[06:57:16] <Cork> jquery uses $ for everything, and instead use normal css syntax to pick what it is
[07:07:36] <impliednude> ahh
[08:16:25] <JJjack> hi  why is nothing appended here?
[08:16:25] <JJjack> https://paste.laravel.io/58ab9e89-73ce-48b8-a1f5-59d4c72b8f7d
[08:16:47] <JJjack> I get the data object but nothing is appeneded
[08:29:28] <Woet> JJjack: test case on www.jsfiddle.net please
[08:30:02] <JJjack> how can jsfiddle with a get request?
[08:47:40] <Koopz> how can i access the response on an $.ajax().fail()?
[08:48:30] <Koopz> .fail(function(jqXHR) {}) that is
[08:49:27] <Koopz> hold on...
[08:51:14] <Koopz> duh... i had a typo... tried to console.log(jqXHR.responseJson) while it should've been jqXHR.responseJSON
[10:40:48] <Robin___> Hello! :) When I click a link the jquery ui dialog shows three times. I just want it to show once. How is this possible: https://jsfiddle.net/har3xckr/
[10:43:19] <Cork> Robin___: https://jsfiddle.net/har3xckr/1/
[10:43:45] <Cork> you used the $('.mylink') selector when you opened the dialog so all links was converted to a dialog
[10:44:37] <Robin___> Cork: oh, look at that :)
[10:45:00] <Robin___> It decides to delete the links at close :o
[10:45:21] <Cork> no as you have moved the link into the dialog
[10:45:37] <Cork> when the dialog is removed the link isn't moved back (as the dialog doesn't know where it came from)
[10:46:18] <Cork> Robin___: if you don't want the link to be moved, just use something else as a source for the dialog ex. https://jsfiddle.net/har3xckr/2/
[10:46:59] <Robin___> Cork. Thats very nice of you. Thanks alot :)
[13:19:46] <rjCousineau> Hello. I want to append an $el that may not exist. so I have if(true) $el = $('<el>');
[13:20:04] <rjCousineau> can I .append($el + $('<div>'))
[13:20:45] <rjCousineau> nm.. the answer is .append($el).append($('<div>'))
[13:42:08] <guideX> I have an input, and a div behind it, but whenever I click on the input, I also get a click event on the div behind it, but I don't want that
[13:42:17] <guideX> I want the div behind it to only click if I click on it
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> guideX when you say "behind" do you mean that the input is a child of that div?
[13:43:02] <guideX> yeah
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> there are two ways to handle that.
[13:43:35] <guideX> I have the return false; there,  on the input click event
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> probably the simplest is to bind a click handler to the input that runs stopPropagation on the event object.
[13:44:26] <robertmaxrees> return false should do the same thing.
[13:44:34] <robertmaxrees> if that's not working, I'd have to see the bug.
[13:44:35] <guideX> ok cool thanks I will check those out
[13:49:24] <guideX> this seems to fix it if (e.target !== e.currentTarget) return;
[13:49:28] <guideX> thanks again
[13:50:34] <robertmaxrees> that's one wya.
[14:02:09] <ajoslin103> Hello, I am having a problem where my single call to .ajax is being repeated every 60 seconds until the remote side returns.  As I write out my problem this way it makes me think of some kind of long-response call - but I have not done anything to set that up or request it.  My app runs on Linux, served by apache and calls a cgi script hosted locally by the same apache server - that cgi script makes a backend call and returns only af
[14:02:09] <ajoslin103> the backend call finishes — lately that remote server has been occasionally taking many minutes instead of several seconds to return.   My webapp logging shows one call, and my apache access_log shows that call repeating every 60 seconds.  So I make a single GET request to the cgi-script and the apache log shows that request repeating every 60 seconds for however long it takes for the backend to return.  What is going on?
[14:13:03] <Robin___> Hello! :) Im trying to read an XML-file and assign some values to variables -> sTitle and sDate. It does get a match. But on line 26 they return blank: https://pastebin.com/WXGefLzc Thanks alot
[14:17:55] <DBrando> Can someone please help me out with this, I'm losing my mind. I'm trying to trigger a click event on a select dropdown option through Jquery
[14:18:10] <DBrando> Is this possible?
[14:19:23] <DBrando> jQuery("#visit_type").val('132').trigger( "click" ) is what I'm trying to achieve
[14:20:11] <DBrando> The html structure is like so
[14:20:36] <ajoslin103> DBrando: are you loading the options dynamically?  You may be trying to add the handler before the option is there?
[14:21:37] <DBrando> <select name="visit_type"><option value="123">This is the item</option></select>
[14:22:25] <DBrando> ajoslin103, unfortunately I'm pretty sure it's there - I can see the dropdown option change
[14:22:52] <ajoslin103> use the console to see that your selection is valid - that looks wrong to me
[14:23:02] <ajoslin103> I’d expect along these lines
[14:23:36] <ajoslin103> $(‘#visit_type’).find(‘[value=“123”]’).trigger)
[14:23:49] <ajoslin103> $(‘#visit_type’).find(‘[value=“123”]’).trigger(‘click’)
[14:23:56] <DBrando> I'll give it a try ajoslin, thank you
[14:23:58] <DBrando> One moment
[14:24:34] <ajoslin103> $(some-selector).length
[14:24:38] <ajoslin103> is a good test
[14:24:49] <ajoslin103> (you want a length of 1)
[14:26:59] <ajoslin103> Robin__ you are returning the results (on line 26) before the call has returned — move that code into the success function?
[14:27:46] <ajoslin103> (or put the display function into a .then attached to teh .ajax
[14:28:57] <poboy> Will someone explain why line 29 returns the full contents of batchLetter (22 arrays) but when I go into the view only 11 arrays are available?  https://kopy.io/LOg37
[14:35:55] <ajoslin103> poboy: it’s hard to say without seeing load_content
[14:37:16] <ajoslin103> assuming that load_content reads from $(new_element).data('batchLetter’)
[14:39:51] <poboy> yes.  it returns some of the data but I don't understand why not all
[14:40:09] <DBrando> ajoslin103, not working unfortunately
[14:40:55] <DBrando> Here's the whole script
[14:41:28] <DBrando> https://thepasteb.in/p/oYhl3N1RV2XcZ
[14:41:41] <DBrando> As you can see I'm already running a check to make sure the whole element is loaded
[14:42:17] <DBrando> Now this works. It simply selects that value in the dropdown (but this does not affect the entire widget which should change based on selection)
[14:42:44] <DBrando> adding trigger('click') to it will do nothing
[14:42:45] <robertmaxrees> DBrando are you trying to drigger an event handler?
[14:43:07] <robertmaxrees> *trigger
[14:43:12] <DBrando> I'm pretty poor with jQuery so I'm not sure, but I think so
[14:43:17] <ajoslin103> DBrnado - so you are trying to set the selection of the menu and have the code that’s bound to the select be executed?
[14:43:31] <DBrando> Yes ajoslin, but I can't find the code bound to the select
[14:43:43] <DBrando> I've been digging through the plugin files for the last 3 hours
[14:43:51] <DBrando> So I gave up and just want to fire a mouseclick event on it
[14:44:01] <DBrando> Figured this would start up the execution of the code?
[14:44:18] <ajoslin103> ah, you need Jardine’s Visual Event — https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visual-event/pbmmieigblcbldgdokdjpioljjninaim?hl=en-US
[14:44:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:44:28] <robertmaxrees> what plugin are you dealing with?
[14:44:41] <ajoslin103> that will let you click on the select and it will show you where the code live and who added it
[14:44:59] <DBrando> robertmaxrees this one https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/
[14:45:09] <DBrando> It's a timetable widget sort of thing
[14:45:19] <DBrando> Trying the plugin ajoslin103, thank you
[14:45:22] <DBrando> addon*
[14:47:39] <ajoslin103> DBrando - jQuery in a WP environment (yum, my favorite… [NOT!])
[14:48:07] <DBrando> I normally don't ever use it and avoid it but the client set up this entire elaborate table
[14:48:13] <DBrando> We've spent 30 hours on it
[14:48:25] <ajoslin103> If you select 123 manually and the page refreshes then you might have to set the value and then submit the form
[14:48:58] <DBrando> And then they discover the table doesn't have a "key feature" they never mentioned
[14:49:11] <DBrando> The page doesn't refresh
[14:49:14] <ajoslin103> but of course
[14:49:21] <ajoslin103> (they didn’t)
[14:49:53] <ajoslin103> ok, so you make a selection and something changes without page refresh
[14:50:14] <DBrando> The Visual Event won't even let me inspect the table but
[14:50:20] <DBrando> I see what happens in the CSS
[14:50:35] <DBrando> display: none is applied across the table, presumably through jQuery
[14:51:06] <DBrando> so by default, when say, Option 1 is selected, all other options on the table get "display: none" slapped on them
[14:51:21] <ajoslin103> is this public somewhere?
[14:51:35] <DBrando> I have the free plugin zip
[14:51:55] <DBrando> But other than that I have no idea where the code could be. I went through it and couldn't find anything
[14:52:07] <ajoslin103> is it anywhere I can see?
[14:52:48] <DBrando> The site is locked to the public but I could share the plugin with you :/ Dunno if that would help
[14:53:27] <ajoslin103> I looked at it - but don’t have an install anywhere
[14:54:28] <ajoslin103> I have a call at 3, but it’s fairly short — I’ll be back in a while
[14:54:30] <ajoslin103> until then
[14:55:53] <ajoslin103> the page puts up a table and that table contains a select that when manually interacted with causes actions dynamically without page refresh
[14:56:16] <ajoslin103> the visual event doesn’t show any bound events attached to the select or the table
[14:57:00] <DBrando> Yeah, pretty much :/
[14:57:10] <ajoslin103> and you want to set the selection programmatically after page-load as if it had been done manually
[14:57:28] <ajoslin103> use chrome to set a ‘break when element is changed’
[14:57:41] <ajoslin103> that will help you to find what’s going on
[14:58:03] <DBrando> I'll look into it ajoslin, thanks so much for all the advice
[14:58:06] <DBrando> Hm
[14:58:09] <ajoslin103> they may have invented a private event type, which you could fire after setting the value
[14:58:16] <DBrando> I've found a very similar table
[14:58:19] <DBrando> http://www.lovestoryyoga.com/classes-buy-schedule/
[14:58:41] <DBrando> The table has this watermark so I've reverse-searched it and found a site with similar features and that same plugin
[14:59:24] <ajoslin103> checking
[14:59:30] <DBrando> The all instructors select - this is what affects the table when an option is clicked
[14:59:35] <ajoslin103> will be back shortly
[14:59:51] <DBrando> No rush, thanks so much everything already
[15:38:41] <ajoslin103> DB - looking at hte lovestory - and it’s the healcode widgets you are also working with?
[15:38:55] <ajoslin103> (mindbody widgets)
[15:39:03] <DBrando> Hey hey
[15:39:08] <DBrando> Yeh, exactly
[15:39:22] <DBrando> Here's a somewhat closer example
[15:39:24] <DBrando> https://www.reynstudios.com/class-schedule/
[15:39:29] <DBrando> But they're pretty much the same
[15:41:36] <DBrando> While you were away ajoslin103
[15:41:45] <DBrando> I managed to successfully run a click event on the dropdown
[15:41:47] <DBrando> http://jsfiddle.net/932wyok6/612/
[15:41:50] <DBrando> With this ^
[15:41:54] <DBrando> And it's still not working
[15:42:11] <DBrando> The dropdown will be selected in the mindbody widget
[15:42:17] <DBrando> But the settings below will not update
[15:42:47] <ajoslin103> ok, I’m just hitting at it a little
[15:46:59] <DBrando> No rush
[15:47:01] <DBrando> Thanks so much
[15:47:09] <DBrando> It's been a giant pain so far
[16:05:45] <ajoslin103> on the love site

[16:07:28] <DBrando> Damn! Trying now, thank you so much
[16:07:45] <ajoslin103> I found it based on what you’d figured out
[16:10:38] <rjCousineau> Hello. I have an array of jquery object. is there a way I can append them into a jquery object?
[16:10:41] <DBrando> Nothing :/
[16:10:53] <DBrando> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatchEvent' of null
[16:10:54] <DBrando> Hm
[16:11:05] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau is it a jquery obnject or an array?
[16:11:06] <ajoslin103> that just means your selector is off
[16:11:28] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau because an array of jquery objects is a strange thing to have
[16:11:29] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees var $arr = [$('<div>'),$('<span>')];   $('<sidebar>').append.apply($arr); doesn't quite cutit
[16:11:33] <ajoslin103> repeat the elem = until you get something
[16:11:41] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau erm
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau so you're trying to create multiple elements?
[16:12:01] <rjCousineau> yes
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> something here seems really odd.
[16:12:13] <DBrando> What do you mean by that ajoslin103?
[16:12:19] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau gotta fiddle?
[16:12:19] <DBrando> Repeat the elem, I mean
[16:12:25] <rjCousineau> sure, 1 minute
[16:12:47] <ajoslin103> DB: what did you use for an ID in this line?
[16:12:48] <ajoslin103> var elem = document.getElementById('mbo_class');
[16:13:16] <DBrando> I used my class
[16:13:30] <DBrando> #visit_type
[16:13:35] <ajoslin103> there should be an id on the select
[16:13:45] <DBrando> Yep, that's the select ID
[16:14:03] <ajoslin103> don’t put the # in the call - it’s only looking for id's
[16:14:21] <ajoslin103> var elem = document.getElementById(‘visit_type’);
[16:14:34] <ajoslin103> does elem then be not-null ?
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're in native JS land at that point.
[16:15:14] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/j6fz7kda/
[16:15:34] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau erm.
[16:15:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:15:49] <DBrando> When removing the # the selection stops working completely (the option isn't selected and the table isn't filtered)
[16:15:52] <robertmaxrees> first off, don't use new Array()
[16:15:59] <rjCousineau> ok
[16:16:10] <DBrando> When # is kept the option is selected in the dropdown - but the table still does not filter
[16:16:17] <rjCousineau> it seems in this fiddle, .append() does work
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau right, because it's not what you want heh
[16:16:52] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> one sec.

[16:23:18] <ajoslin103> yw
[17:10:06] <Levin^> hi there
[17:10:14] <Levin^> I have this code I found somewhere
[17:10:19] <Levin^> http://jsfiddle.net/MMZ2h/4/
[17:10:52] <Levin^> as you can see, this is a bad implementation of an element moving when you scroll around
[17:11:00] <Levin^> it can easily go wrong
[17:11:23] <Levin^> do you guys have some clue on how to make it move properly?
[17:13:46] <robertmaxrees> I'm confused.
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> 1) what makes it "bad"?
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> 2) what do you actually wnat?
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> *want
[17:22:59] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: if you move the scroll fast, the left moves slow. if you move the scroll slower, the leaf moves super fast
[17:23:09] <Levin^> I wanted it to move consistently
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> that's because you're using .animate()
[17:26:15] <robertmaxrees> and using +10 / -10.  the scroll event fires so quickly that you're basically stoping over the animation
[17:29:28] <Levin^> hm
[17:29:40] <robertmaxrees> what's the desired effect at the end of the day?
[17:30:21] <Levin^> it must stay fixed at its position, lime it was just relavively positioned
[17:30:37] <Levin^> like*
[17:30:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> why not position it absolutely?
[17:31:15] <Levin^> it's best to show a live example, a sec
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:23] <Levin^> http://ldb.nacaodesign.com.br/
[17:31:34] <Levin^> take a look at the main menu
[17:31:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> where?
[17:32:31] <Levin^> it has the logo in the center and four items, two at each side
[17:32:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:32:54] <Levin^> if you scroll the page up and down, you'll see it dances a lot
[17:33:10] <Levin^> and it's all okay
[17:33:37] <Levin^> the problem is that there's a small bug when you scroll down and up really fast
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> did you implement that feature yourself?
[17:34:29] <Levin^> I created a js to force position the menu to the correct position, but my script only works and the 0 position of the window scroll
[17:34:43] <robertmaxrees> could you share that js in a fiddle?
[17:34:57] <Levin^> if you scroll a pixel down, the menu will just disappear
[17:35:01] <Levin^> sure
[17:35:18] <Levin^> I didn't implement this by myself, it's a wordpress theme I'm working over
[17:35:25] <Levin^> a sec
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> you said "my script"
[17:35:44] <robertmaxrees> i took that to imply you wrote it.
[17:36:15] <Levin^> I made a script to handle the scrolling bug on the main menu
[17:36:24] <Levin^> but it's incomplete
[17:36:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> so
[17:36:46] <robertmaxrees> was that feature apart of the original theme?
[17:37:06] <Levin^> no, it is from the original theme
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what I asked.
[17:37:27] <robertmaxrees> and did you pay for the theme?
[17:37:30] <Levin^> oh, sorry
[17:38:09] <Levin^> https://jsfiddle.net/j9tkj5dt/
[17:38:11] <Levin^> here
[17:38:17] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:38:22] <robertmaxrees> did you pay for the theme?
[17:38:33] <Levin^> yes, and my boss loves it a lot
[17:38:37] <Levin^> lol
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> then you should have some kind of support from the dev - i'd submit a bug with the,.
[17:38:56] <robertmaxrees> *the,m
[17:39:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of hacking around it.
[17:39:02] <Levin^> my script just adds a class, and that class forces the element's position
[17:39:13] <robertmaxrees> that's still a bug.
[17:39:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:39:24] <Levin^> hm
[17:40:02] <Levin^> I think this is the theme where the support wasn't very welcoming.. well
[17:40:20] <robertmaxrees> you paid for it tho.
[17:40:27] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to hack around somebody else's bnugs.
[17:40:30] <robertmaxrees> *bugs
[17:40:35] <Levin^> I see
[17:44:12] <Levin^> oh, support expired ^^`
[17:44:17] <Levin^> sad
[17:45:29] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:47:53] <Levin^> I'll try to use .offset() or .position()
[17:54:44] <robertmaxrees> the real issue is you're using animate.  but OK.
[17:55:52] <Levin^> ok
[18:10:12] <gambl0re> hi robert
[18:13:28] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:14:21] <gambl0re> how going?
[18:14:29] <robertmaxrees> it's a monday.
[18:14:42] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[18:15:50] <gambl0re> i'm good...
[18:15:56] <gambl0re> im going to pm you ok?
[18:16:06] <robertmaxrees> please don't! :)
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm happy to help if you've got questions - just leave it in the channel :)
[21:09:58] <aro> is there a way to intercept an event triggered by inline JS on an anchor?
[21:10:24] <aro> like onclick="$('#elem').trigger('submit', [true]);"
[21:12:26] <jc> hi, i've got an element with id that's the title of the blog post, which contains inverted commas. but when selecting in jquery, it's not matching. I've tried escaping, but to no effect. Any ideas?
[21:13:27] <robertmaxrees> jc can you show us what you mean?
[21:13:29] <jc> element: id="post-Prophecy gems from 'Clearing of the Planet'
[21:13:36] <robertmaxrees> oh
[21:13:46] <jc> selection: $(id="Prophecy gems from \"Clearing of the Planet\"")
[21:13:50] <jc> gives a syntax error
[21:13:52] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're using invalid chars?
[21:14:30] <jc> perhaps because unfamiliar with jquery or js
[21:14:33] <robertmaxrees> and you need to escape the literal inverted comma chars.  and wrap the whole selector in a string,.
[21:14:40] <robertmaxrees> but really, I'd fix the ID itself.
[21:14:46] <robertmaxrees> to a valid attribute value.
[21:15:09] <jc> i'd be inclined to, but it's a site generation tool, and it doesn't seem to offer much flexibility with that.
[21:15:36] <robertmaxrees> "a site generation tool" like...?
[21:15:41] <jc> hexo
[21:15:48] <aro> is that possible?
[21:15:50] <jc> isn't that string escaped?
[21:16:10] <robertmaxrees> jc doesn't change the fact that those IDs are invalid./
[21:16:20] <jc> ic
[21:16:24] <robertmaxrees> and you're not passing a string to $() inm that case.
[21:16:28] <robertmaxrees> you're passing an evaluation.
[21:17:06] <aro> $('#your weird element name which probably wont work')
[21:17:06] <jc> worst case can just removed the inverted commas, return to plain or pure comma-less string.
[21:17:11] <jc> *remove
[21:17:26] <robertmaxrees> or use a class.
[21:17:32] <aro> dont use $(id="....") anyways
[21:17:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[21:17:50] <robertmaxrees> that's both a bad idea and invalid syntrax.
[21:17:55] <aro> ^
[21:18:05] <jc> it does work on a single word though, that particular form.
[21:18:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[21:18:16] <robertmaxrees> $(id="") shouldn't...
[21:18:17] <aro> well do you know how selectors work
[21:18:31] <aro> #element nextelem andnext andnext
[21:18:52] <aro> its going to think its a parent element with a whole ton of children invalid element
[21:18:52] <aro> s
[21:19:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not why it would throw an error though.
[21:19:04] <aro> your stuff is gonna implode and take you with it
[21:19:08] <jc> not especially well, barely much really. more at the edges as yet. and didn't expect this kind of thing to arise quite so soon.
[21:19:12] <robertmaxrees> $(id="some string here") is going to cause issues.
[21:19:14] <aro> whats the error it throws?
[21:19:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5e5y32n/
[21:19:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[21:19:52] <jc> haven't tried plain string.  just with commas and a single word.
[21:20:39] <aro> well its trying to evaluate an expression :)
[21:21:27] <robertmaxrees> i think what you meant was https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5e5y32n/1/
[21:21:37] <robertmaxrees> or something similar.
[21:21:53] <robertmaxrees> but really, those are bad IDs.  update the template to use classes or something.
[21:21:55] <jc> hmm
[21:23:35] <jc> that's something to go on. clearly some more knowledge on selectors would be useful. glad that's sorted though somewhat. a fiddly issue. thanks for the comments.
[21:35:57] <jc> that last selector with brackets works by the way.  that might be the golden egg sought.
