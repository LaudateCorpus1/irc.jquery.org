[10:56:15] <Dhiva> Hi I want to add an element "<a class='verified'>Verified</a>" in a its parent class like I am using $('.verify').parent.after("element"). But before that I need to remove the exiting verified class element inside that
[10:57:45] <Dhiva> Hi I want to add an element "<a class='verified'>Verified</a>" in a its parent class like I am using $('.verify').parent.after("element"). But before that I need to remove the exiting verified class element inside that. For that I am using parent.removeChild(".verified"). But its not adding again.
[11:04:28] <pavonia> You can store the parent element in a variable and then do the deleting/adding of the children
[11:08:09] <AdamPDotty> verify.remove() should suffice
[11:09:28] <AdamPDotty> but sounds like you want $('.verify').replaceWith()
[12:02:46] <relipse> what does $(element).trigger('submit'); do if element is not a <form>
[12:04:36] <AdamPDotty> Should depend on the browser. Usually nothing I guess.
[12:06:48] <AdamPDotty> ah, initiates submit event in firefox
[12:08:10] <relipse> does it submit the form if the parent parent parent is a <form> ?
[12:08:29] <AdamPDotty> still depending on the browser but yes
[12:09:54] <relipse> so if you have $(element).trigger("submit') it is bad
[12:10:01] <relipse> if element can be anything other than a form
[12:12:03] <AdamPDotty> Just tested in firefox, safari, chrome. All bubble submit.
[12:13:39] <AdamPDotty> Might still depend on sircumstances. It is possible a form is not submitted this way when there is no submit button.
