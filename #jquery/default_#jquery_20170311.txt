[04:31:16] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/6hyguu3v/ whats wrong in that code? i don´t get why it not show the one that match
[04:36:37] <Whiskey> aha
[07:25:01] <BlueShark> Hi, what's a good way to show a vertical news ticker? Are there some already existing solutions?
[08:57:26] <Elles> can I set default function that is a parameter for another function?
[08:58:46] <Elles> function f(callback = f() {});
[09:00:05] <shoky_> Elles: yes, you can
[09:00:18] <shoky_> same as setting any other default param
[09:01:53] <Elles> can I omit the argument then in calls if I want it to be default?
[09:02:20] <shoky_> that's what it means for it to be a default ;)
[09:02:37] <shoky_> why ask instead of try...
[09:05:16] <Elles> try or guess
[09:05:27] <Elles> its a 1 liner so hard to paste a stupid example
[09:05:56] <shoky_> wat
[09:14:18] <momomo> Where can I view the implementation for Arrays.isArray(array)  ? I need to mimic it in the Java world to supply an object that would return true in certain cases.
[09:48:33] <pavonia> momomo: The semantics of the base functions are explained in https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm IIRC
[10:02:49] <codecutter> how can I sort the keys in the objects on line 4 and 11 in asc order? http://pastebin.com/SwFtUcNJ
[10:03:09] <codecutter> dates*
[10:10:35] <codecutter> anyone?
[10:14:32] <decx> Object.keys()
[10:17:03] <codecutter> decx: Object.keys(postVolume).sort()
[10:17:06] <codecutter> ?
[10:18:08] <decx> depends if you just want to dates sorted
[10:18:54] <decx> i'd transform posVolume to an array of { date: datestring, val: val} objects and use sort because objects cant technically be sorted and dont guarantee index
[10:27:54] <codecutter> decx: can i see an example of how you would do it?
[10:28:02] <codecutter> jsfiddle
[10:28:13] <decx> oh right that's what i was doing
[10:28:34] <decx> i was thinking, didnt i just open jsfiddle for something
[10:32:35] <decx> something like this https://jsfiddle.net/qcwmf9yL/
[10:32:46] <codecutter> :)
[10:33:11] <decx> oh that's desc
[10:33:19] <decx> well you can move the - to the other 1 for asc
[10:33:29] <decx> and they key you access should be obvious
[10:33:41] <decx> the key*
[10:59:39] <codecutter> decx: not working, i get days 3,14,13 https://jsfiddle.net/qcwmf9yL/1/
[11:01:09] <decx> like i said, move the - for asc
[11:05:15] <codecutter> decx: ok but if it desc then it would not either, right?
[11:06:21] <decx> no, third of march, 14th, 13th of feb, 18th of jan
[11:06:56] <decx> wait
[11:07:07] <decx> it is wrong!
[11:07:09] <decx> ;D
[11:08:55] <decx> oh of course
[11:09:09] <decx> it's would have to be 03
[11:10:51] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/qcwmf9yL/2/
[11:10:56] <decx> something like this should do
[11:13:05] <codecutter> better
[11:13:17] <codecutter> and for asc?
[11:14:02] <decx> that should be ovious by now
[11:14:12] <codecutter> yes :)
[11:14:50] <codecutter> thx
[12:57:55] <juinn> any guru's about please?
[13:16:17] <sahbeewah> what’s your problem
[14:29:50] <juinn> sahbeewah: you still about?
[16:28:12] <Me1of1> Hey there:) could someone please help me figure this out http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gmWGJz how can I make this columns to have the same hover effects as this http://preview.themeforest.net/item/crystalskull-gaming-magazine-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/13612358 columns? namely Im interested in that icon hand sliding down right in middle and that bottom line that extends to the whole width of the column? thanks
[16:35:11] <Me1of1> someone please ?:-/
[16:47:38] <cannap> Me1of1, which effect you mean
[16:48:27] <cannap> ah
[16:48:28] <cannap> i see
[16:48:43] <Me1of1> cannap, when on hover a small hand slides down and the bottom thing line extends to the whole width
[16:48:55] <Me1of1> i made the hand part http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wJdPvQ?editors=1100 but im not sure
[16:49:22] <Me1of1> how to echeive the slide down part, i imagine initially i'd hide the hand and on hover use jquery to show the hand and slide to the middle? but thats the part that im not sure how to do it :-/
[16:52:16] <Me1of1> cannap, you know any way i can get that result with my example snippet http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wJdPvQ?editors=1100 ?
[16:59:41] <cannap> @Me1of1,  so http://codepen.io/cannap/pen/dvWZpZ?editors=1100 ?
[17:00:34] <cannap> you can control this more with animatons
[17:00:37] <cannap> keyframes
[17:03:16] <Me1of1> cannap, yes!! :) thanks for that, I was just about to read up about keyframes but from what I can tell it doesnt have good browser support, Id like to be able to have it work on IE8+
[17:03:32] <cannap> lol
[17:03:39] <cannap> fuck this animation on ie9
[17:03:56] <Me1of1> lol why cannap ?
[17:04:00] <cannap> ie9 is dead
[17:04:14] <cannap> and ie8 anyway
[17:04:29] <cannap> i just a animation
[17:04:33] <cannap> no one will worry about
[17:04:44] <cannap> about this
[17:04:48] <cannap> it dont break any other things
[17:04:56] <Me1of1> aha i know but turns out there are still people in their caves that use those browsers lol ok so just use keyframes?
[17:05:21] <cannap> the keyframe option will not c hange the browser support
[17:05:31] <cannap> but you have more controll about the animation
[17:06:23] <Me1of1> ill give it a try once i get the main setup look right :-/ how would i accomplish the second part ohh~ you great cannap ? that on hover that thing line appears and extends to the whole width of the element?
[17:06:43] <cannap> yea it centers
[17:06:48] <Me1of1> i think this one tricks needs jquery to be used
[17:07:08] <cannap> its centers it dont care about how hight or width the parent is
[17:07:16] <cannap> the parent just need relative
[17:07:32] <cannap> you can do the same with flex
[17:07:39] <cannap> but when you talk about ie8 then dont use flex
[17:08:21] <Me1of1> well its not like the majority of my users are IE8, its only a small porition and its okay if i lose some of them since i already use flex for my main grid
[17:09:01] <cannap> but anyway this is not a good soltion
[17:09:13] <cannap> you should make this just via transforms
[17:09:20] <cannap> top left moving is slower
[17:09:25] <cannap> need more repainting or something
[17:09:32] <cannap> not 100% sure about this part need to learn that
[17:10:09] <cannap> because mobile but this animation on mobile is anyway useless
[17:10:39] <Me1of1> ah i dont intend to animate this on mobile, only on desktops but ill try to translate your snippet to keyframes just about now :)
[17:11:04] <cannap> do it its not hard
[17:11:14] <Me1of1> thanks for the help and advice cannap, let me turn this into keyframes and then ill take on this underneath color thing that expands :)
[17:11:27] <Me1of1> aha ive dome some keyframes before it aint that complicated indeed
[17:34:25] <Sandlayth> hello world
