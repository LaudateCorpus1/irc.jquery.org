[01:48:40] <robertmaxrees> lol gonna start kicking people that keep asking non-jquery questions in here.
[17:44:29] <audiobum> i want a user to click on a button, and after clicking, when hovering over elements, the elements get a border around them until (any arbitrary) element in the DOM is clicked. I don't need help with the highlighting, but how would i implement a conditional on-hover?
[17:47:27] <audiobum> e.g. #elementA is hovered over, #elementA gets a purple border
[17:54:25] <robertmaxrees> you bind the listener always and check a var for the current "state".
[17:58:07] <robertmaxrees> audiobum
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm, another shotgunned question :)  wonder why people keep doing that lately :/
