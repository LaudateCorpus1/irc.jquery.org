[01:11:58] <dandanrevolution> Hi
[01:14:51] <dandanrevolution> I'm trying to set up a filter. I have a bunch of divs with data attributes containing dates like data="2017-01-27" and I want to click a link like "February, 2017" and only show those divs where the date begins with "2017-02"
[01:19:37] <dandanrevolution> Would I put something like onclick="filterByMonth('2017-02')" on the link?
[01:20:53] <dandanrevolution> and then have the function add a "show" class to divs with data starting with 2017-02
[01:21:05] <dandanrevolution> I'm quite new to javascript so any tips are appreciated
[01:21:38] <hlt> hello, any jquery pros here? I'm getting an error on Opera only, "Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined at Function.Sizzle.contains
[01:22:53] <hlt> wait nevermind
[01:22:57] <hlt> ignore that
[02:00:59] <ace139> can i use multiple jquery ui functions for the same selector ?
[02:02:34] <ace139> like ('textarea').jqte();
[02:02:35] <ace139> then again ('textarea').someotherfunction();
[02:06:04] <Neo_122> hi guys
[02:12:45] <Cork> ace139: the selector is just to find the element in question, the functions isn't bound to the element explicitly
[02:13:08] <Cork> ace139: it depends on how the plugin is implemented if there are problems with calling multiple at the same time
[02:15:23] <ace139> Cork, if I want to implement the .jqte() and the JQuery UI autocomplete in the same <textarea> tag ?
[02:15:34] <ace139> Cork, I am not been able to do it.
[02:15:46] <Cork> not sure what jqte is
[02:16:23] <Cork> some plugins replace the form elements, and then things like autocomplete will work on the wrong element
[02:16:28] <Cork> that might be what you're seeing
[02:18:55] <ace139> Cork, I am talking about this
[02:18:57] <ace139> http://jqueryte.com/documentation
[02:20:32] <Cork> its an wysiwyg so by definition it replaces the textarea
[02:20:44] <Cork> as textarea can only display text
[02:22:06] <ace139> Cork, any idea how to do it?
[02:22:29] <Cork> you have to write custom code explicitly for getting the two plugins to work together
[02:22:48] <Cork> and no i can't give you how without reading through the entire jqe plugin
[02:23:14] <Neo_122> hi
[02:23:20] <Neo_122> have JQuery
[02:23:24] <Neo_122> I have trouble
[02:23:30] <ace139> Cork, I am very new to JS, will it take very long to write the custom plugin?
[02:23:54] <Cork> its not a custom plugin, but you have to integrate the two plugins
[02:23:57] <Neo_122> I need when I click to link change php var , for this I send Ajax request ,
[02:24:14] <ace139> Cork, okay
[02:24:15] <Cork> meaning instead of using there default features you have to write code to make them talk to each other
[02:24:20] <Neo_122> but that work long and user when go to page see old meaning this var , not changed
[02:24:26] <Cork> and i can't say how long it would take for the same reason as what i just said
[02:24:32] <Neo_122> how make pass from link ?
[02:24:52] <ace139> Cork, fair enough
[02:25:00] <ace139> Cork, thanks for the help mate
[02:25:06] <Cork> Neo_122: not sure what it is you exactly are asking for
[02:25:16] <Cork> could you make a jsfiddle.net with the problem?
[02:25:37] <Neo_122> no , this is common structure
[02:25:47] <Neo_122> I can explain you more clearly
[02:26:51] <Neo_122> Cork, I have links on lessons http://prntscr.com/esm57k
[02:27:31] <Neo_122> Cork, and var task , which have currency task which user making now
[02:28:12] <Neo_122> Cork, imagine user close window and this var will set not in 1 , for example 5, and when user click on lessons link he will do 5 task
[02:28:48] <Neo_122> Cork, I need when user click on lesson make this task 1 and than direct user to page where hi will do task
[02:29:12] <Cork> Neo_122: please just make a demo of the problem instead of writing a novel...
[02:29:33] <Neo_122> Cork, I use Click and send Ajax request which set task  to 1 , but Ajax work long and user see old value
[02:30:09] <Neo_122> Cork, user when click to link see old value of task, Ajax work longer than he passed to page
[02:30:17] * Cork puts Neo_122 on ignore
[02:30:23] <Neo_122> Cork, I need maybe make delay
[02:30:34] <Neo_122> Cork, how make delay in click function ?
[02:31:04] <Neo_122> Cork, or wait till Ajax  return result and than only direct user to page ?
[02:31:32] <Neo_122> Cork, ideally I need wait Ajax and only then pass user to page , How make this ?
[02:33:53] <Neo_122> Cork, see code https://pastebin.com/YHsR8wT1
[02:34:11] <Neo_122> Cork, need make delay in function click till return Ajax
[03:19:53] <Duikb00t> o/
[03:20:32] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/4dcvpamj/  I would like to add an index to my array
[03:21:02] <Duikb00t> Ola forget about that
[03:21:10] <Duikb00t> I mean this paste: https://jsfiddle.net/vdnLq1qg/3/
[03:23:23] <brezimenko> https://www.petrol.si/nes any idea, why this isn't working in IE and EDGE but is in CHROME and FF?
[03:36:49] <Duikb00t> hmm
[04:02:12] <Kartagis> what does 405 Method not allowed mean when doing an ajax request with PUT?
[04:02:35] <Cork> Kartagis: normally that the server doesn't allow you to do put
[04:02:45] <Cork> or that you don't have permission to do so
[04:03:41] <Kartagis> Cork: according to what the owner of the server told me, the server allows anon requests
[04:03:52] <Kartagis> and I can verify PUT
[04:03:58] <Cork> Kartagis: PUT is normally meant to modify server data
[04:04:33] <Kartagis> please see http://iothook.com:8000/api/v1/books/
[04:05:06] <Cork> Kartagis: that's GET not PUT
[04:05:39] <Kartagis> upload a file and see the headers please
[04:06:04] <Cork> Kartagis: anyway you will have to ask the server admin why you get the error
[04:06:11] <Kartagis> Allow:GET, POST, OPTIONS <--- does this mean I'm not allowed to PUT?
[04:06:19] <Cork> yes
[04:06:29] <Cork> cause last i saw PUT isn't in that list
[04:06:31] <Kartagis> this is on the erroneus transaction
[04:09:00] <Kartagis> POST gives me bad request
[04:09:21] <Kartagis> iirc, it means the request is malformed
[04:17:31] <Whiskey> var div = document.createElement('div'); div.textContent = text; return div.innerHTML; <- canÂ´t that be done more nice whit jQuery? like just use text()
[04:26:25] <Cork> Whiskey: $('<div>').text(text).html()
[04:27:58] <Whiskey> thanks
[04:28:35] <Whiskey> Cork, im stuck on this, it only match first match, and not mutliply match on same line or multiline https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/dtnaho9L/13/ but its not really jQuery
[04:50:37] <teta> does this make any sense to you? https://pastebin.com/pdC1DHPT
[05:05:30] <obinoob> hi jquery if firing a log under console on 409 status codes and possible 403 too! I wonder if I can stop this? https://postimg.org/image/7br3zxbl3/   code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dba1573592388fbca0b5b743d61657ef
[05:08:39] <obinoob> anyone around?
[05:09:41] <Cork> obinoob: it isn't jquery it is the browser
[05:09:45] <Cork> and no you can't prevent it
[05:10:18] <obinoob> Cork: are you sure? Ugly...
[05:10:29] <Cork> obinoob: why, the network log is for developers
[05:10:40] <Cork> so it will log http errors
[05:10:49] <Cork> and 4xx and 5xx are http errors
[05:11:35] <obinoob> Cork: I get it, I thought I could filter it...
[05:11:37] <Cork> if you don't want to see network errors in the console you can turn that off in the console settings
[05:11:53] <obinoob> ok ;)
[05:12:10] <obinoob> Cork: so there is nothing I can do?
[05:12:17] <Cork> if you don't want to see network errors in the console you can turn that off in the console settings <--
[05:12:28] <Cork> its a browser setting, not a website setting
[05:13:19] <obinoob> Cork: I get it thank you for the intel ;)
[05:14:31] <obinoob> I thought it was from jquery because jquery file gets logged...
[05:14:51] <Cork> it just points to where the network request was generated from
[05:17:05] <obinoob> nice to kwon that ^^ I'm sending a 409 from backend... perhaps I should go with some $data array and set 'error' => 409 ?
[05:19:37] <obinoob> Cork: anyway thank you once more ;)
[05:38:14] <naftilos76> Hi, would it be absurd to assign a function to a data- attribute of a tag element? And when needed do something like el.data("func")() ? I did it and it worked. What do you say?
[05:54:32] <Cork> naftilos76: worth knowing is it isn't data- attribute
[05:54:44] <Cork> .data() can store functions data- attributes can't
[05:56:24] <naftilos76> Cork, i was referring to data- which can be assigned with el.data("name", value) . How would you call it if not 'attribute' ?
[05:56:42] <Cork> naftilos76: that is $.data or jquery data cache
[05:56:47] <Cork> it is NOT data-
[05:57:16] <naftilos76> ok thanks
[05:57:16] <Cork> $.data is populated from data- attributes if the cache doesn't have the key
[05:57:20] <Cork> but they are not the same
[05:58:03] <Cork> naftilos76: an option, that might be cleaner is to do my_functions[el.data('funcName')]()
[05:58:26] <Cork> naftilos76: but ya, storing functions in .data() is actually on of the reason it was once added (jquery ui uses it a lot)
[06:00:07] <naftilos76> Cork, thanks
[06:02:28] <Kartagis> I can't append a file to FormData, can you help?
[06:02:39] <Deusdeorum> I am trying to add a listener on google maps marker, i am trying to get the long lat, and preferable the search box should be updated to the new location when drag n' drop the marker: https://jsfiddle.net/L9tdp0Lc/1/
[06:02:46] <Deusdeorum> where am i failing this?
[06:08:03] <Cork> Kartagis: fmd.append('name', file)
[06:08:08] <Cork> should be fairly easy
[06:13:27] <Kartagis> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/7krbvgpv/
[06:13:59] <Cork> yup should work just find
[06:14:01] <Cork> *fine
[06:14:56] <Kartagis> Cork: idk why, but it sends null
[06:18:03] <Cork> might be you don't select a file or the wrong input field then
[06:18:10] <Cork> cause that's how it works
[06:24:21] <sadf> Hi, it's me again
[06:24:46] <sadf> Can somebody help me how to fix the problems with alternating the icons here https://jsfiddle.net/d0s3wg5b/3/
[06:27:35] <sadf> Basically the icons and the behaviours are messed up
[06:28:49] <sadf> When you click the info icon it turns into x and shows info but when you click the mail icon the info icon that turned into x remains x
[06:29:08] <sadf> At this point it doesn't show the mail
[06:29:29] <sadf> aaand vice versa
[06:29:35] <Kartagis> silly question: does FormData only work for file upload? I mean, can I select files from my gallery and append them to FD?
[07:35:04] <shoky_> Kartagis: in your fiddle  input.files[0]  should be input[0].files[0]  because input is a jquery object, not the raw DOM element
[07:35:31] <Kartagis> shoky_: oh, okay thanks
[07:35:38] <Kartagis> one more thing
[07:35:41] <shoky_> Kartagis: and FormData works for any kind of data really. didn't understand the 2nd part of your q
[07:37:01] <Kartagis> we generally use FD for file upload. can I alternatively use it for appending images I pick off my gallery?
[07:37:13] <shoky_> what gallery?
[07:37:21] <Kartagis> image gallery
[07:37:26] <shoky_> what image gallery..
[07:37:40] <shoky_> no idea what you're referring to
[07:37:57] <shoky_> but.. FD can be used to upload files :)
[07:38:05] <shoky_> images are examples of files..
[07:38:28] <Kartagis> in my cordova app, I read my phone gallery and add the images to DOM. I'm referring to that
[07:38:38] <shoky_> i have no idea about cordova
[07:39:16] <Kartagis> cordova is a mobile framework that can create hybrid apps
[07:39:20] <shoky_> i know what it is
[07:40:17] <shoky_> DOMs/browsers don't have image galleries.. if your framework lets you access some image gallery - that's up to your framework.. i have no idea about how to use cordova or how it integrates with a phone's image gallery
[07:42:53] <Kartagis> allow me to demonstrate. https://jsfiddle.net/x8y946ak/
[07:43:23] <shoky_> i still don't know how to use cordova ;)
[07:46:08] <Kartagis> shoky_: the question is not about cordova. it's about whether I can append the images added on line 10 to FD
[07:46:32] <shoky_> but to upload a file with FD you need to have it as a native Blob or File object iirc.. so you'd need to find out if cordova can give you access to the gallery's images as a Blob or File
[07:46:40] <shoky_> Kartagis: it has everything to do with cordova
[07:47:36] <Kartagis> shoky_: this plugin allows me to access the gallery, I take it from there and add the images to DOM
[07:48:22] <shoky_> Kartagis: you add an image URL to the DOM, not the actual image
[07:50:10] <shoky_> or well, i only see a thumbnail URL
[07:50:20] <shoky_> anyway.. this is the wrong channel
[07:57:52] <Kartagis> why is it sending the image nullified? http://jsfiddle.net/7krbvgpv/1/
[07:59:14] <shoky_> Kartagis: it's sending fine for me
[07:59:42] <adept-phil> It's not, it's returning the value as null....
[07:59:46] <adept-phil> Check your headers on teh POST
[07:59:51] <adept-phil> Check your headers on the POST
[08:00:06] <Kartagis> please see https://www.dropbox.com/s/kf20io4czg6pzwu/Screenshot%202017-04-05%2014.58.56.png?dl=0
[08:00:43] <adept-phil> Yeah, and?....
[08:00:43] <adept-phil> http://imgur.com/a/olDGY
[08:00:57] <shoky_> Kartagis: your field name is "file", not "image".. and files won't be in the regular form fields anyway..
[08:02:15] <adept-phil> shoky_ +1
[08:02:16] <Kartagis> yay!
[08:02:26] <Kartagis> thanks shoky_ and adept-phil
[08:17:05] <Deusdeorum> So still stuck in my map question. I got the long lats by adding correct listener. But how to set default starting position for my marker? thought i did so on row 23.. https://jsfiddle.net/80Lx6ek9/2/
[08:47:41] <shoky_> Deusdeorum: you're passing 2 different values for the "position" option there
[08:48:13] <Deusdeorum> hmmm, where?
[08:48:27] <shoky_> Deusdeorum: lines 23 and 25
[08:50:16] <Deusdeorum> hmmm okey, but removing row 25 does not make the marker visiable from start
[08:50:21] <Deusdeorum> which is weird=
[08:50:24] <xenaxon> hello, anyone good with MUSTACHE?
[08:50:26] <xenaxon> i need some help guys!
[08:50:50] <shoky_> Deusdeorum: that code only runs after you search.. you're inside the places_changed event handler
[08:54:09] <Deusdeorum> shoky_ you are right, but i also want the marker do be bind to the search box, is this possible?
[08:54:49] <shoky_> Deusdeorum: yep you can add as many markers as you like, from wherever you want..
[08:55:07] <Deusdeorum> ye but then if you search you will have two markers right?
[08:55:16] <shoky_> if you add two, you'll have two ;)
[08:55:29] <shoky_> unless you remove one ;)
[08:55:33] <Deusdeorum> hahah
[08:55:42] <shoky_> or just update one's position, if that's possible with the API (probably is)
[08:56:00] <Deusdeorum> i need one that i) is set on a default position on load, ii) changes when you search iii) moves when you drag and drop
[08:56:07] <shoky_> go for it :)
[08:56:44] <Deusdeorum> so i can just remove the marker variable inside the places_changed event handler? put it outside?
[08:57:09] <shoky_> as i said, you can remove it and add a different one, or (probably) you can just upadte the same one's position
[08:58:14] <Deusdeorum> the fuck how bad i am with js
[08:58:22] <shoky_> learn to read docs, fully.
[08:58:38] <shoky_> go through the google maps API docs, you'll learn a lot i bet
[09:00:46] <Deusdeorum> you are right! reading docs and other people codes help a lot
[09:01:13] <shoky_> depends who the other people are :)
[09:01:39] <shoky_> ~90% of online blog tutorials, for example, do not help a lot :)
[09:01:50] <shoky_> (and i just made up that 90% of course)
[09:01:53] <Deusdeorum> nah, i am my self more of a pythonist. going down in peoples bad code is really helping to get further
[09:02:09] <MagnusVortex> 93.7% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
[09:02:18] <shoky_> uh no that's not a good way to learn a language, but whatever
[09:02:48] <Deusdeorum> http://norvig.com/21-days.html
[09:03:09] <Deusdeorum> applicable on me here :-) WHY WONT MY MAP WORK !"!â¬#!"
[09:04:05] <shoky_> nah you were more like  <Deusdeorum> so i can just remove the marker variable inside the places_changed event handler? put it outside?
[09:04:21] <shoky_> which is fine ;)  but probably implies you indeed do need to work some on your js skills
[09:04:33] <Deusdeorum> I truly do!
[09:37:38] <Smoleniuch> Hi
[09:37:52] <Smoleniuch> can someone help me?
[09:38:10] <Smoleniuch> i would like to use jQuery $.post() request
[09:38:23] <Smoleniuch> how do i pass settings in that single request?
[09:38:32] <Smoleniuch> i cant figure out documentation
[09:39:25] <Smoleniuch> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/#jQuery-post-settings
[09:39:52] <Smoleniuch> i must pass settings as fifth argument?
[09:42:42] <Smoleniuch> or i must use ajax method to achieve this?
[09:42:54] <Smoleniuch> is this question too stupid :D?
[09:57:42] <shoky_> Smoleniuch: it says you can do $.post({ ... settings ... })
[09:58:14] <Smoleniuch> oh
[09:58:33] <Smoleniuch> i understand now
[09:58:38] <shoky_> e.g. $.post({url: '/foo', data: 'bar'}}
[09:58:40] <Smoleniuch> thanks anyway
[09:59:28] <Smoleniuch> im trying to pass csrf token into the request
[10:01:03] <shoky_> example: if it's called _csrf and it's supposed to be a regular post param:  $.post('/url', {_csrf: theToken})
[10:01:33] <shoky_> where {_csrf: theToken}  is the post data
[10:10:38] <Smoleniuch> thanks shoky_ !
[10:12:23] <Smoleniuch> is is good idea to store one tokne inside meta tag for all requests?
[10:25:04] <titii> Hey guys. I have an event $(...).on('change', function(event){..) ... then i just call $(...).change(); to process the event... The question is, can I somehow send an "argument" into event? Somehow: $(...).change({myArg: 'testbvlablas'}); and then take this argument in the event like $(...).on('change', function(event){ event.getArgument? Ty
[10:42:44] <Cork> titii: $().trigger('change', [arg1, arg2, arg3]); $().on('change', function(event, arg1, arg2, arg3) {});
[10:43:33] <titii> ty Cork, I already foud that.. thanx

[12:25:24] <robertmaxrees> can you show us in a fiddle the issue you're having?
[12:26:16] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: i tried but i will make a screenshot
[12:26:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:26:36] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you tried and we can try fixing it from there?
[12:26:47] <robertmaxrees> screenshots don't tell me what your code looks like.
[12:30:10] <robertmaxrees> posDialog making a fiddle isn't hard - mind showing me where you got tripped up?
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> posDialog so let's get that part working.
[12:31:38] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: im using Object {my: "right bottom", at: "right bottom", of: "#main-container"} for position but this will show the dialog under the main-container
[12:31:51] <posDialog> here a pic https://s18.postimg.org/pz79fpdrt/def.png
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> err...
[12:32:02] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really help me see your html.
[12:32:11] <robertmaxrees> \nor show me how it's broken.
[12:32:29] <posDialog> robertmaxrees:  if I knew how it was broking than i could fix it by my self lol
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> let's rephrase: how am I supposed to help when you can't even show me the problem?
[12:32:59] <ngharo> posDialog: i think you want {at: 'top'} maybe
[12:33:15] <ngharo> '
[12:33:58] <posDialog> ngharo: i want it it the main-containers right bottom but inside the main-container
[12:34:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:35:01] <robertmaxrees> "i don't know why it's broken but you can totally trust my description of it" ;)
[12:35:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46h82asq/ here's a basic dialog.
[12:35:56] <robertmaxrees> can you update this to give a little more context?
[12:36:08] <ngharo> you're so hell bent on helping, but only under your terms
[12:36:12] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: so i want a FB effect the dialog on bottom right
[12:36:18] <ngharo> and it's obvious what he's trying to achieve
[12:36:24] <robertmaxrees> not obvious to me.
[12:36:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:36:47] <ngharo> "(pop a dialog) i want it it the main-containers right bottom but inside the main-container"
[12:36:52] <ngharo> what isn't obvious about that robertmaxrees
[12:37:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't have context for what any of that means :)
[12:37:18] <ngharo> bullshit, you know jquery UI like the back of your hand i'm sure
[12:37:29] <robertmaxrees> not really.  and there's no reason to get nasty with me.
[12:37:40] <robertmaxrees> if you have a concern, you're more than welcome to PM me about it :)
[12:42:07] <ngharo> posDialog: like this? https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/2/
[12:42:46] <ngharo> those options "my, at" are confusing :|
[12:43:00] <posDialog> ngharo: is it because im using #main-container { position: absolute } because in your example it works
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:43:40] <ngharo> posDialog: https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/3/ so, nope.. works there too
[12:44:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah man no reason to show any code from your site - not relevant at all ;)
[12:48:22] <ngharo> being condescending is always relevant, eh
[12:48:34] <MagnusVortex> knock off the snarky comments, you two
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> just ribbing you duder.
[12:48:43] <posDialog> ngharo: Thanks! I thin i got it worked :P
[12:48:58] <ngharo> sweet
[12:49:23] <posDialog> ngharo: you saved my day!
[12:50:03] <robertmaxrees> MagnusVortex how you doing?
[12:51:22] <MagnusVortex> I'm... feeling kinda weird, but nothing specific to complain about. Life's going quite well otherwise.
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> good!
[12:51:32] <MagnusVortex> maybe that's why it feels weird?
[12:51:36] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> all too familiar with that feeling.
[12:52:35] <MagnusVortex> I'm thinking I've got about 4 months to make enough progress in my side project to get it up and running
[12:53:17] <MagnusVortex> that'll leave me with 2 months to add it to my resume and do some serious job searching
[12:53:34] <MagnusVortex> I figure It'll be time to get out of here in 6 months to a year
[12:54:12] <MagnusVortex> just need to catch up on sleep from the extreme programming I did over the weekend
[12:54:24] <MagnusVortex> and lay down an actual plan
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> very nice.
[12:54:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're plenty busy :)
[12:55:49] <MagnusVortex> yarp yarp
[12:55:55] <MagnusVortex> I just need to keep the motivation up, ya know?
[12:56:02] <robertmaxrees> Absolutely.
[12:56:12] <MagnusVortex> I have just enough done to be embarassing
[12:56:24] <robertmaxrees> nah, nothing embarassing about getting stuff done.
[12:57:13] <MagnusVortex> once I get in the visualization, that's when I can start raising eyebrows
[12:57:33] <MagnusVortex> know anything about d3 or three.js?
[12:57:58] <MagnusVortex> or any of their competitors?
[12:58:03] <robertmaxrees> i know some of our dudes used NVD3 which depends on D3.
[12:58:26] <robertmaxrees> d3 alone, iirc, requires a ton of boilerplat.
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> it's super flexible but that may not be what you want.
[13:01:04] <MagnusVortex> I just need a simple graph-theory kind of graph that you can interact with
[13:01:24] <MagnusVortex> nodes, edges, and the ability to drag them around
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> mm. not sure about that.
[13:01:41] <MagnusVortex> double click a node to view nodes its related to
[13:01:46] <MagnusVortex> that kind of stuff
[13:02:04] <MagnusVortex> s/its/it's
[13:02:34] <MagnusVortex> I've seen examples of it being done in d3
[13:03:22] <MagnusVortex> and I know of an example of it being done in three.js, but that makes a 3-d environment to explore, not 2d (which may or may not be beneficial, I haven't thought enought about it.
[13:07:43] <z1haze_work> i am preventing default form submission because I need to retreive a nonce token for payment processing, and then i want to submit the form as normal with the nonce attached, but when i try $(this).submit() after my prevent default, and after ive retrieved my nonce nothing happens
[13:09:39] <egggrolll> are you doing that in the success of the ajax call to get the nonce?
[13:10:00] <MikeD_> do you have any form controls named 'submit' ?
[13:10:31] <z1haze_work> using braintree, calling a tokenize method on the library
[13:10:40] <z1haze_work> returns a payload that has the nonce
[13:10:52] <z1haze_work> i assign that nonce to a hidden input and i want to continue to submit the form as usual
[13:11:11] <z1haze_work> i wonder if i need preventDefault()
[13:11:47] <egggrolll> it seems like you are doing some asynchronous logic, so i'm wondering if the 'this' is still your form at the point that you try to resubmit it
[13:12:02] <posDialog> How can i make a minimize and maximize event for my dialog window ?
[13:12:11] <z1haze_work> ah good call
[13:12:15] <z1haze_work> didnt think about that
[13:12:28] <MikeD_> instead of using .on('submit' .. ) you could use .one('submit', .. ) so it only stops the first time submit is attempted... then your programmatic call doesn't get stopped
[13:12:45] <z1haze_work> i just converted to an arrow function and we'll se
[13:13:01] <robertmaxrees> or just call .submit() against the native DOM node.
[13:13:10] <robertmaxrees> instead of the jquery one
[13:13:35] <MikeD_> oh, that's an interesting trick
[13:13:39] <z1haze_work> the issue was the this context - thanks
[13:13:48] <egggrolll> awesome
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> or pass extra data with .trigger() and check for it in the handler.
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> couple different ways to do it.
[13:15:26] <zampa>  $('#game').innerHTML = "test" <-- why doesn't that work? it doesn't seem to add anything to the div (with id "game<)
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> innerHTML is only on DOM nodes.
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> you want .text()
[13:15:48] <MikeD_> https://www.google.com/#q=nonce&*  why is almost every word have an NSFW meaning on urban dictionary?
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> or .html()
[13:16:56] <MikeD_> i use $('#foo').get(0).outerHTML for debugging (ymmv)
[13:16:58] <zampa> oh i see .html() then.
[13:17:41] <egggrolll> $().prop('outerHTML') if you want to avoid the get()
[13:17:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.  few different ways.
[13:18:06] <MikeD_> that's cool too, glad i shared... because that's better.
[13:21:14] <z1haze_work> hmm still having an issue, it seems after i preventDefault() on the submit() it wont let me submit it at all even calling submit()
[13:21:58] <MikeD_> isn't calling submit firing another event that is handled with e.preventDefault() ?
[13:22:10] <z1haze_work> yea i assume so
[13:22:15] <z1haze_work> this is what im trying to do http://dpaste.com/1SXZS8Y
[13:23:03] <z1haze_work> unbind works but it seems hacky
[13:23:53] <taplar_> i'd try submitting the dom form like robert suggested
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> jus tcall submit on the underlying dom node or pass data using trigger that you look for in your handler.
[13:24:42] <z1haze_work> not sure how to do what you are suggesting
[13:24:45] <MikeD_> or only "handle" the submission attempt .one() time
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ what happens when he needs to submit the form a second time? ;)
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[13:25:40] <MikeD_> is that even a thing?
[13:25:48] <robertmaxrees> see the "extraparameters" thing?
[13:26:35] <z1haze_work> yea but i dont see how that would submit my form
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> then look at http://api.jquery.com/on/ - see the "data" arg?
[13:27:19] <robertmaxrees> can check for the existence for an extra bit of data and, if it exists, keep on truckin'/
[13:27:20] <z1haze_work> what data am i supposed to be passing
[13:27:20] <posDialog> Im trying to create a FB message effect with dialog UI, i tried something with animate and toggling but cant get the dialog-titlebar on bottom of my main div https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/4/
[13:27:21] <taplar_> submitting the dom element would be just this.submit() instead of $(this).submit()
[13:27:22] <robertmaxrees> if not, preventdefault.
[13:27:23] <z1haze_work> im not connecting the dots here
[13:27:32] <z1haze_work> ohh
[13:27:35] <z1haze_work> so just a flag
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  or just use taplar's suggestion.
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> both work.
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> posDialog http://stackoverflow.com/a/14520286/923919
[13:29:35] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: i dont want to use that plugin i want to create something i want to learn
[13:29:56] <robertmaxrees> 'kay...  so what's the first step you need to do here?
[13:30:13] <posDialog> what do you mean
[13:30:22] <z1haze_work> taplar_: im getting submit is not a function
[13:30:24] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down into steps.
[13:30:37] <taplar_> verify 'this' is a form element
[13:30:44] <z1haze_work> i did
[13:30:48] <z1haze_work> well
[13:30:50] <z1haze_work> $(this) is
[13:30:57] <z1haze_work> jquery object of that form
[13:31:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze so then this should be the dom node itself.
[13:31:39] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: if i use 1 dialog it works almost correct why is it not with the second one ?
[13:31:55] <z1haze_work> console.log(this) shows the form element yes
[13:32:01] <taplar_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit
[13:32:04] <z1haze_work> this.submit() is not  function
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> posDialog $(".ui-dialog").height()
[13:33:32] <robertmaxrees> this isn't finding the current one.
[13:34:21] <robertmaxrees> gotta contextualize to the current one
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> and then clean up the calculations a little.
[13:36:24] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: if console.log(this) shows the markup for the form element, and then this.submit() says no function
[13:36:26] <z1haze_work> what is the issue
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> got the code handy?
[13:37:08] <taplar_> do you have an element in the form with the name 'submit'?
[13:37:37] <z1haze_work> nope
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:39:02] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/33WWX59 there is no buton or input with type submit
[13:39:46] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: tell me
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> var self = this; beforehand, then use self.submit()
[13:39:58] <robertmaxrees> posDialog tell you what?
[13:40:25] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: how to make the calculation to get the both divs on bottom on titlebar click
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> posDialog couldn't you just re-call the position dealio for the dialogs when they're minimized?
[13:40:29] <z1haze_work> using arrow functions is suppposed to keep from having to rebind to this
[13:40:37] <z1haze_work> but ill try
[13:40:38] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: how ? :o
[13:40:40] <robertmaxrees> z1haze just noticed that.  sorry.
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> posDialog the docs show you how.
[13:40:56] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/74L8gmk3/
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> posDialog http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[13:42:35] <z1haze_work> if i remove the prevent default it should still do whatever is inside the .submit() before posting to the server, right?
[13:42:58] <taplar_> you are performing async logic however
[13:43:06] <z1haze_work> ah yea
[13:43:40] <taplar_> submit is a method for a HTMLFormElement, as the docs and my fiddle confirm.  So i'm not sure why you are getting your error
[13:43:48] <z1haze_work> well my boss wants me to have a way to get a response for that card before posting to our server
[13:43:58] <z1haze_work> in case the card fails he doesnt want to have to redirect back with empty credit  card fields
[13:44:01] <z1haze_work> which makes sense
[13:44:10] <z1haze_work> we cant repopulate fields that are iframed
[13:44:52] <z1haze_work> i just need to be able to get this nonce before submitting the form, it seems so simple
[13:45:45] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: i try this $("#dialog").dialog("option", "position"); ?
[13:46:06] <posDialog> robertmaxrees:  or do i need to reset new once ?
[13:46:15] <robertmaxrees> that's the getter syntax.
[13:46:29] <robertmaxrees> check out the example right after that for the setter syntax
[13:46:51] <z1haze_work> taplar_: i even just tried document.querySelector('#checkout-form').submit(); and it still says submit() doesntexist
[13:47:49] <taplar_> console.log(document.querySelector('#checkout-form').tagName);
[13:48:19] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: pff :D was that so simple :$
[13:48:23] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: thanks man!
[13:49:17] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: now i just need to get the $(this) id name than i can do that.dialog("option", "position", that.dialog("option", "position")) ?
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze try $('#checkout-form').find('#submit').length
[13:49:25] <robertmaxrees> what do you gat?
[13:49:29] <z1haze_work> FORM
[13:49:39] <taplar_> weird
[13:49:43] <z1haze_work> i said i dont have a submit input
[13:49:45] <z1haze_work> ealier
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> z1haze try anyway?
[13:49:51] <taplar_> neither did my fiddle
[13:50:23] <z1haze_work> 1
[13:50:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze soooo....
[13:50:35] <robertmaxrees> you DO have a child with that ID.
[13:50:41] <z1haze_work> yea
[13:50:45] <z1haze_work> but its not a type of submit
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> but it has that ID.
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:50:59] <z1haze_work> correct
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing your problem.
[13:51:14] <z1haze_work> the id of submit?
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:51:22] <z1haze_work> interesting, why?
[13:51:30] <taplar_> ooooh, i said name earlier not id
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a property of the form that overrides the method name.
[13:51:33] <taplar_> X|
[13:51:46] <z1haze_work> well then
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> change the id.  see it work :)
[13:51:54] <taplar_> i half remembered that issue, :P
[13:52:34] <z1haze_work> how will the form know to submit then
[13:52:39] <z1haze_work> its just a button at tht point
[13:52:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:53:03] <taplar_> a form doesn't need a submit button to work
[13:53:08] <z1haze_work> clicking this button wont trigger a form submission anymore then will it
[13:53:15] <taplar_> if a form only had input fields, a user could hit enter and it would submit
[13:53:20] <z1haze_work> i understand that
[13:53:25] <z1haze_work> but the button needs to also submit it
[13:53:35] <taplar_> sure, and it will, as it belongs to the form
[13:53:39] <z1haze_work> anyhow ill play with this at least i know the culprit
[13:53:47] <taplar_> if you are talking about a <button> or <input type="submit">
[13:54:34] <z1haze_work> bingo got it
[13:54:43] <z1haze_work> i was able to give the <button> type of submit and its working now
[13:54:45] <z1haze_work> thnks guys
[13:55:20] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: whats the quickest way to get the dialog ID based on click events
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> this.id
[13:55:38] <taplar_> <button> doesn't need a type of submit.  it already submits
[13:55:45] <robertmaxrees> why would you need the id tho?
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> you'e already in the handler.
[13:55:52] <taplar_> <button> is short hand for <input type="submit">
[13:56:26] <z1haze_work> oh i didnt make it
[13:56:32] <z1haze_work> it was boiler plate from braintree
[13:57:00] <z1haze_work> but when it comes to posting to the server thy just 'alert' and say this is whwere you post to the server etc
[13:57:15] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: i want to do  $(this).dialog("option", "position", $(this).dialog("option", "position")) because of multiple dialogs
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> then do that?
[13:58:20] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: but thats not working https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/5/
[13:58:49] <robertmaxrees> you need the parent.
[13:59:55] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: $(this).parent() also not doing it
[14:00:21] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools.
[14:00:23] <robertmaxrees> see the error?
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> weee
[14:04:23] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[14:07:46] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: what does that error means ?
[14:08:21] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: do you have the solution ?
[14:15:18] <robertmaxrees> prolly gotta store the initialized dialogs in a var and then reference those instead.
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm maybe not.
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:18:27] <robertmaxrees> need to get the div you initialized against: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46h82asq/6/
[14:18:31] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't work, but it's a start.
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> also: you're using a global var to hold state for both of those.
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah  i'm all kinds of mixed up today hahaha
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll have to do that object storage thing I mentioned.
[14:23:48] <Kartagis>  http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7krbvgpv/2/ why is this throwing Illegal invocation?
[14:24:48] <robertmaxrees> "'slice' called on an object that does not implement interface Blob."
[14:26:39] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis it doesn't like "image": input[1].files[0]
[14:28:17] <Kartagis> isn't it the same thing as js?
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[14:28:36] <robertmaxrees> it's probably trying to parse things in a way it shouldn't
[14:28:42] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/13333478/923919
[14:32:13] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: on maximize it jumps away from the main div why ?
[14:32:51] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/7/
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> "jumps away from the main div"?
[14:33:49] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: yes it does a padding of 2em or something
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:34:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that.
[14:34:22] <posDialog> minimize than maximze by clicking on the titlebar
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're doing.
[14:34:55] <robertmaxrees> remember when I said that global state var would bite you?
[14:35:19] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: wait i have now this thats a old one
[14:35:42] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/46h82asq/9/
[14:36:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the bug triggers when you minimize both and then maximize the next one.
[14:36:19] <robertmaxrees> aaah you're not using it any more.
[14:37:14] <posDialog> yes thats another bug but im gonna fix that with setting the id name also in the titlebar robertmaxrees  the bug is whenever dialog 1 is minimized and maximized its jumping 2em from main div
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> why is "of" for the second one set to the first one?
[14:38:32] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like
[14:38:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46h82asq/10/
[14:39:30] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: hmm now it works like i want it, but i had for the second one the of to position next the first one, how to do with the third dialog than ?
[14:39:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd get each dialog's width and add them together.
[14:43:59] <posDialog> robertmaxrees:  hmm i see it yes whenever i want it to the div prev it jumps up :/
[14:44:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:44:47] <posDialog> robertmaxrees:  so the math will be based on window * windowWidth ?
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:45:05] <robertmaxrees> it's based on the width of elements...
[14:45:28] <c1v0> 4051
[14:45:31] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: 130px is the width of ?
[14:45:44] <c1v0> sorry, wrong window
[14:45:44] <robertmaxrees> posDialog the dialogs.
[14:45:54] <robertmaxrees> but you can automatically calculate that differently.
[14:46:12] <posDialog> robertmaxrees: how ?
[14:46:31] <robertmaxrees> posDialog you can search google for "jquery get width of element"
[14:46:34] <robertmaxrees> or something similar ;)
[14:46:50] <posDialog> robertmaxrees:  you mean width() ?
[14:46:56] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:46:58] <robertmaxrees> gotta go.
[14:47:01] <robertmaxrees> bye
[14:58:07] <Es0teric> if i wanted to empty only a div's text.. how would i do that?

[18:22:28] <zampa> Anyone here good with datatables?
[18:39:27] <robertmaxrees> zampa if you have a question, just ask; if somebody can help, they will :)
[18:41:00] <cannap> i have a question
[18:41:17] <cannap> but i dont know where to start
[18:41:18] <cannap> -.-
[18:41:44] <robertmaxrees> "hi - i have this piece of code that does x, but i wish it did y instead"
[18:41:53] <robertmaxrees> <insert link to code here>
[18:41:55] <cannap> sure
[18:42:07] <cannap> but i have no idea how to start
[18:42:14] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:42:21] <robertmaxrees> what is the code doing and what should it be doing instead?
[18:42:52] <cannap> there is no code
[18:43:03] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the problem statement?
[18:43:05] <cannap> just a image
[18:43:09] <robertmaxrees> "i want to do X - how can i do that?"
[18:43:56] <cannap> https://gyazo.com/b5f68d694e7087cf95b0bcb129fb6bde
[18:44:04] <cannap> you see the image in the middle
[18:44:16] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:44:19] <zampa> robertmaxrees: fair enough. i just started working with datatables today and im currently generating tableData/tableColums from the database.. But when outputing it to the datatable I seem to need to create this: https://pastebin.com/MD2x4fMx
[18:44:21] <cannap> i have no idea how i can make smooth zoom
[18:44:22] <cannap> ok
[18:44:29] <robertmaxrees> "smooth zoom":?
[18:44:45] <zampa> I was hoping that there was some setting so all i really need to create in the pug is table#example.display(cellspacing='0', width='100%') that and have the table headers generated by the data i give to the datatable.
[18:44:52] <cannap> i dont know how to describe
[18:45:01] <robertmaxrees> is it pixellated?
[18:45:10] <cannap> yes
[18:45:27] <robertmaxrees> make sure the image is high rez enough.
[18:45:52] <robertmaxrees> and search around for "smooth image zoom" or w/e in google.
[18:45:58] <cannap> its np has 3xxx x 2xxxx
[18:45:59] <cannap> np
[18:46:11] <cannap>  ah
[18:46:32] <cannap> i know this
[18:46:43] <robertmaxrees> zampa https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/16206/dynamically-create-table-headers-and-content
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> that answer your question?
[18:46:52] <cannap> wait i show the whole
[18:47:00] <zampa> let me check..
[18:48:09] <zampa> ah i was there before but guess i didnt quite understand it. :D
[18:48:31] <cannap> https://gyazo.com/3932d0c75402bc711f16f9a593df958f
[18:48:53] <cannap> i want to zoom the image in the middle nice
[18:49:03] <zampa> robertmaxrees: the example code they show arent doing what i want it done...
[18:49:10] <cannap> i know how to do xD but is there a jquery solution
[18:49:30] <robertmaxrees> cannap are you using a css soluton now?
[18:49:41] <cannap> its just gfx
[18:49:47] <cannap> no code yet
[18:49:47] <robertmaxrees> cannap huh?
[18:49:54] <robertmaxrees> cannap yeah, search google.
[18:49:58] <robertmaxrees> there should be some good ideas there.
[18:50:02] <robertmaxrees> zampa you want to automatically generate headings, right?
[18:50:23] <cannap> ok
[18:51:05] <zampa> robertmaxrees: i want to have as much created automatically
[18:51:22] <zampa> as the table will look different depending on whats shown..
[18:51:43] <zampa> so when i generate all the optiotns id love to create them there.
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> zampa hrm.  i mean, https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/js_array.html
[18:52:17] <robertmaxrees> you could use js to create that columns object if you really need to.
[18:52:31] <zampa> hmm
[18:52:34] <zampa> that seems to be it.
[18:52:40] <zampa> so what does that do that mine doesnt...
[18:52:53] <cannap> oO
[18:53:04] <cannap> i need to learn more englisch
[18:53:39] <robertmaxrees> zampa i'm not sure - i don't see your JS anywhere...
[18:53:42] <zampa> oh  i create my columns this way {"data": "price per unit"}
[18:53:45] <zampa> thats why..
[18:53:57] <robertmaxrees> gotta follow their columns definition
[18:55:24] <zampa> yeah i have done so much coding last fet days its insane
[18:55:38] <zampa> a week ago i had never touched node.js or jquery
[18:55:51] <zampa> heck i havent really coded for the last 7 years.
[18:57:20] <robertmaxrees> lots to learn then!
[18:57:46] <zampa> i already have a website up and running with websockets datatables routing heck way overkill
[18:57:49] <zampa> i got a crash course :D
[18:57:54] <robertmaxrees> neat
[18:57:56] <zampa> oh so much headache though..
[18:58:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:12] <zampa> oh darn...
[18:58:22] <zampa> now i regret using notepad++
[18:58:27] <robertmaxrees> oh jeeze.
[18:58:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:58:38] <robertmaxrees> get sublime text or atom or vs code
[18:58:39] <zampa> i undid a few things to check an old version of the file.
[18:58:48] <zampa> then i edited the file..
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> and learn git
[18:58:59] <zampa> now my 'updated' file is gone.
[18:59:08] <robertmaxrees> that's common to pretty much any editor...
[18:59:21] <zampa> yeah i need an editor with revision control :P
[18:59:29] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:59:34] <robertmaxrees> revision control is seperate.
[18:59:36] <robertmaxrees> git
[18:59:38] <robertmaxrees> it's easy enough
[18:59:48] <zampa> ugh thats a lot of change i need to fix :(
[18:59:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:59:59] <zampa> i wonder how many hours i lost due to my mistake.
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> ah
[19:00:20] <zampa> forgot i did undos to check how i coded one thing a long time ago
[19:00:26] <zampa> and stupidly edited that version :P
[19:00:37] <zampa> darn it..
[19:00:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, git.
[19:18:16] <zampa> robertmaxrees: so i changed it around so it uses '{title: "amount"}'
[19:18:37] <zampa> yet it wont show anything if i remove the thead/tr/th's
[19:19:02] <robertmaxrees> you using an up to date version?
[19:19:12] <robertmaxrees> because that page i linked only has the table for markup.
[19:19:43] <zampa> i use same datatable as they do.
[19:19:54] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[19:20:01] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise, I'd need to see it.
[19:20:23] <dialogUI> I'm trying to do a FB messaging with dialog UI but the result is not how i want it can someone help me here a fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/r0hgshv5/
[19:20:45] <zampa> robertmaxrees:  https://pastebin.com/vx4GhtrA
[19:20:50] <zampa> thats the javascript generating the datatable
[19:20:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue now dialogUI?
[19:21:09] <robertmaxrees> zampa can you make a standalone fiddle instead?
[19:21:22] <zampa> i really dont think i can no. xD
[19:21:29] <robertmaxrees> erm...
[19:21:35] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: again if I minimize and maximize it doesnt work correct strange behavior
[19:21:48] <robertmaxrees> zampa should be as easy as getting the object you're using and going from there...
[19:21:58] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI you mean the gap that shows up?
[19:22:56] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: yes on minimze than maximize it doesnt opens it on bottom of main div
[19:24:28] <zampa> robertmaxrees: im trying to do that now. one sec.
[19:24:35] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI http://stackoverflow.com/a/40951901/923919
[19:24:40] <robertmaxrees> could try something like this.
[19:25:46] <robertmaxrees> zampa https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ey4y6t4e/
[19:25:53] <robertmaxrees> you can just pop in your js and go from there.
[19:25:54] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: but i already use this Object {my: "right bottom", at: "right bottom", of: "#main-container", collision: "fit", using: function} ?
[19:26:20] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI did you actually read the example?
[19:26:26] <robertmaxrees> they use a different approach.
[19:26:58] <robertmaxrees> same position object but different configuration.
[19:27:21] <zampa> http://imgur.com/a/NfOAu thats the object i get back
[19:27:30] <zampa> sorry trying to work on geting a string or something..
[19:27:36] <zampa> it seems to be same structure as they show.
[19:27:45] <robertmaxrees> zampa do JSON.stringify(whateverthatishere)
[19:27:47] <robertmaxrees> and then copy tha.
[19:27:49] <robertmaxrees> *that
[19:27:55] <zampa> ah
[19:27:56] <robertmaxrees> or just an example of the data.
[19:29:40] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: yes to position it with css style top and left, so Object {my: "right bottom", at: "right bottom", of: "#main-container", collision: "fit", using: function} is not usable anymore ?
[19:29:59] <zampa> if you can see my fiddle.. i pasted what i got returned in the css section
[19:30:02] <zampa> to not overwrite anything
[19:30:12] <robertmaxrees> zampa share it then.
[19:30:20] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI i'm not saying that.
[19:30:25] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI i'm giving you options to explore.
[19:30:34] <zampa> how do i share it?
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted to do this yourself and not use a plugin so i'm feeding you ideas.
[19:30:43] <zampa> ah update
[19:30:44] <robertmaxrees> zampa hit the update and then paste the link here.
[19:30:45] <zampa> https://jsfiddle.net/ey4y6t4e/1/
[19:31:15] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: why is my fiddle working correct https://jsfiddle.net/r0hgshv5/ ? whenever clicking create it works good but only with mini/maximize
[19:31:22] <zampa> it looks like it should work imho.
[19:31:40] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI dunno duder!  giving you things to look into that might fix the issue.
[19:32:19] <zampa> if i console.log the objcet i get { data: ....., columns: [ { title: 'amount' }, { title: 'price per unit' } ]
[19:32:38] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: is that a normal behavior ?
[19:32:42] <robertmaxrees> zampa what about the code where you init?
[19:32:53] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI most people don't use jquery ui dialogs for this purpose so... not really?
[19:33:08] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: what does they use ?
[19:33:16] <robertmaxrees> they build their own solution.
[19:33:21] <zampa> Oh that may be it..
[19:33:22] <robertmaxrees> or use one of thje many available options.
[19:33:26] <zampa> I think i see the problem :(
[19:33:41] <robertmaxrees> zampa https://datatables.net/manual/data/#Objects fwiw.
[19:33:46] <robertmaxrees> this may have good info for you.
[19:33:49] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: yea i thought dialog UI would be great to use that :(
[19:33:55] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI not really.
[19:34:05] <robertmaxrees> dialogs are meant for showing info to a user, not for chat windows.
[19:34:18] <robertmaxrees> but you can shoehorn 'em i guess - may just need to approach the problem differently.
[19:34:43] <robertmaxrees> i have you a link to a plugin that fixes this specific issue for you.
[19:34:46] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[19:34:46] <zampa> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4e72ad4bb7352b298e7b015ad6c03e83 <--- thats the problem
[19:35:01] <zampa> i actually only seem to send in the data to the datatable.
[19:35:06] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: actually i dont know how to use the plugin
[19:35:28] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI you said outright you didn't want to use it and that you wanted to do it yourself...
[19:35:43] <zampa> so even though it generated perfectly. i dont do anything with it.
[19:35:58] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: yes i like to fix it by myself i was almost there but now i give it up
[19:35:58] <robertmaxrees> kay
[19:36:09] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI so then go fish up that link and use it! :)
[19:36:24] <zampa> no wait thats not it..
[19:36:33] <zampa> ugh im so confused.
[19:36:46] <robertmaxrees> zampa it's probably the data format and the bad init call.
[19:37:07] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: which file do i need https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend ?
[19:37:33] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend/blob/master/example.html
[19:37:37] <robertmaxrees> check out the example.
[19:37:51] <robertmaxrees> probably https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend/tree/master/build one of these.
[19:38:13] <zampa> 'the bad init call'?
[19:38:29] <robertmaxrees> zampa the call to initialize the plugin doesn't look right compared to what i see on their site.
[19:39:24] <zampa> well the script works... if i just hard code in the table headers in the html file
[19:39:29] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend/master/build/jquery.dialogextend.js
[19:39:43] <robertmaxrees> zampa so then it doesn't ;)
[19:39:50] <robertmaxrees> zampa you need to tell it the headers manually.
[19:39:56] <robertmaxrees> according to the example on their site.
[19:40:08] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI won't be able to link to that, but sure.
[19:40:27] <zampa> but...
[19:40:40] <robertmaxrees> zampa heh - it really doesn't look like there's a way around it duder.
[19:40:43] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[19:40:53] <zampa> https://jsfiddle.net/ey4y6t4e/2/ <--- i want something exactly like that.
[19:40:58] <robertmaxrees> check out that page i linked.  maybe there's an answer there.
[19:41:13] <robertmaxrees> right - that defines the column titles.
[19:41:26] <zampa> and how many there are.
[19:41:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:41:36] <robertmaxrees> nobody said you have to do that all inline.
[19:41:47] <zampa> so really...
[19:41:48] <zampa> hmm
[19:41:51] <Es0teric> alright so... i am in a $.each() and i have an object that has an array of objects.. but i want to recursively add those objects inside of each element in the first $.each() how would i do that?
[19:42:02] <zampa> Lets try something..
[19:42:05] <robertmaxrees> zampa https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ey4y6t4e/3/
[19:42:09] <robertmaxrees> could try something like this.
[19:42:15] <zampa> if i HARDCODE that exact object
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> doesn't work there, but you get the gist.
[19:42:18] <zampa> into my code.. it has to work?
[19:42:30] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric hrm?
[19:42:32] <zampa> as it works there i can eliminate that its the object not looking as it should..
[19:43:47] <robertmaxrees> zampa https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ey4y6t4e/4/
[19:43:49] <zampa> dammit.
[19:43:49] <robertmaxrees> here, this works.
[19:43:54] <zampa> that object works.
[19:44:01] <zampa> so now i know there is some slight error with the object im creating.
[19:44:02] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple
[19:44:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees -> https://pastebin.com/ciRLHXkn this is the idea...
[19:44:43] <Es0teric> where $reactions is... i want to append each element inside of the divs i will specify by adding each object into a <li> from line 8
[19:45:11] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric can  $( 'li#activity-' + v  ) rely on a class instead?
[19:45:26] <Es0teric> no
[19:45:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[19:45:35] <robertmaxrees> really?  no other selector?
[19:45:42] <Es0teric> no
[19:45:44] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[19:45:46] <Es0teric> because that selector already exists
[19:45:52] <Es0teric> i didnt build that selector.. its from buddypress
[19:46:01] <robertmaxrees> are there any other lis in that UL that you don't want?
[19:46:12] <Es0teric> i am going to be building lis
[19:46:16] <robertmaxrees> or are you saying you want to get the li with just that child?
[19:46:27] <robertmaxrees> because right now you're selecting LIs
[19:46:41] <Es0teric> ok.. you see how i have .find() in there?
[19:46:48] <Es0teric> .activity-reactions only has one div
[19:46:49] <robertmaxrees> or are activity_ids a specific subset that you need?
[19:46:58] <Es0teric> i want to append a div inside of .activity-reactions (each activity-reactions)
[19:47:20] <Es0teric> the activity_ids is what i need to loop through, thats necessary
[19:47:30] <robertmaxrees> i'd .filter() in this case.
[19:47:32] <robertmaxrees> invert the logic.
[19:47:44] <Es0teric> .filter() what specifically?
[19:48:14] <robertmaxrees> $('.theUlThatHoldsTheseLIs li').filter(function() { return activity_ids.indexOf(this.id) > -1 });
[19:48:27] <Es0teric> dude activity_ids is a array of just ids
[19:48:32] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: i get Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialogExtend prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'minimize
[19:48:51] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric okay?  and?  my example works exactly with that scenario.
[19:49:35] <zampa> so it seemes the problem occurs when im sending data with res.json( myobject)
[19:49:43] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok i am not following you
[19:49:48] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric one sec.
[19:49:49] <Es0teric> let me show you the structure before i can decide
[19:49:56] <zampa> if i hardcode in the object i showed you as a response it works. if i send that very send object with res.json() it doesn't work.
[19:50:03] <Es0teric> let me show you the div structure because thats important
[19:50:16] <robertmaxrees> zampa so look at the object and see what the differences are.
[19:50:35] <zampa> i use the exact same object though.
[19:50:43] <robertmaxrees> it's different to the frontend.
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> maybe there's a wrapper or something getting added.
[19:50:51] <robertmaxrees> or it's a string.
[19:51:14] <robertmaxrees> have you tried JSON.parse(theobject)?
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fxbfLpev/
[19:52:37] <robertmaxrees> so you use filter to get just the elements you wnat.
[19:52:44] <robertmaxrees> then you can do all sorts of simple stuff from there.
[19:54:12] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so now https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fxbfLpev/1/
[19:55:02] <zampa> i am not sure how i can do JSON.parse() on it :D
[19:55:19] <robertmaxrees> zampa link to the code again?
[19:55:23] <robertmaxrees> where you try to initialize?
[19:55:38] <zampa> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/87b37cb47b6bc0c9c19ef9eab50186f2
[19:56:04] <robertmaxrees> wait what
[19:56:05] <robertmaxrees> dataSrc: 'data'
[19:56:08] <robertmaxrees> that'll never work...
[19:56:14] <robertmaxrees> are you tryinmg to use the data from the server?
[19:56:14] <zampa> it works.
[19:56:22] <robertmaxrees> data can't be a string there though.
[19:56:36] <robertmaxrees> try dataSrc: data
[19:56:56] <zampa> well that works as long as i have the headers set up in the table.
[19:57:01] <robertmaxrees> ah, nvm.
[19:57:01] <zampa> i get all data and everything.
[19:57:05] <robertmaxrees> you're using ajax to init.
[19:57:36] <robertmaxrees> so then https://datatables.net/reference/option/ajax is relevant here.
[19:57:48] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://pastebin.com/7RX7QSjN thats the structure
[19:58:03] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric did you see my last fiddle?
[19:58:08] <Es0teric> im looking now
[19:58:13] <Es0teric> got distracted a bit
[19:59:14] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: i give it up :D
[19:59:21] <robertmaxrees> dialogUI huh?
[19:59:26] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty trivial.
[19:59:37] <Es0teric> dude why would i be overwriting the #activity-{id} to empty?
[19:59:47] <Es0teric> i need that.. other things rely on that #activity-{id}
[19:59:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:59:54] <robertmaxrees> you're not.
[20:00:04] <dialogUI> robertmaxrees: yes it is but not working like i want it i collapse it buy stays on position :/
[20:00:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm using that as an example to show you what you can do with .map()
[20:00:08] <robertmaxrees> and .filter()
[20:00:24] <robertmaxrees> and that's not removing it from the original element.
[20:00:51] <robertmaxrees> this inverts things because doing a bunch of dom lookups like you were is a little inefficient.
[20:01:03] <robertmaxrees> this does it once and then filters them down.
[20:01:12] <Es0teric> so what im storing everything in vars
[20:01:18] <Es0teric> then mapping against that?
[20:01:32] <robertmaxrees> that just outputs a different format of data
[20:01:39] <robertmaxrees> you could replace that part with something else.
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> you said you want to append a div to those elements?
[20:02:39] <Es0teric> well i just want to append row of list elements to each .activity-reaction element
[20:02:57] <robertmaxrees> each one whose id was in that array, right?
[20:03:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees correct
[20:03:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7Lzc1o9g/
[20:03:32] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[20:04:41] <zampa> robertmaxrees: im trying everything i cant seem to undrestand exactly whats wrong
[20:04:46] <Es0teric> OHHHHH
[20:04:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees wow it just hit me
[20:04:50] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric ;)
[20:04:50] <Es0teric> lmao
[20:04:57] <Es0teric> you arent replacing activity-
[20:05:00] <robertmaxrees> never steeered you wrong before mano.
[20:05:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah,.
[20:05:04] <Es0teric> you are removing just activity- and comparing against the number
[20:05:08] <Es0teric> which is why you're looking for -1
[20:05:27] <Es0teric> yeah you know it helps that im drinking now
[20:05:32] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:05:35] <Es0teric> it hits me slower but i get it
[20:05:50] <Es0teric> sober its harder cuz im overthinking too much
[20:07:01] <Es0teric> so then $theElementsICareAbout becomes $theElementsICareAbout.find('activity-reactions').each(function() {}); right?
[20:07:26] <Es0teric> well... .find('.activity-reactions');
[20:07:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[20:08:23] <Es0teric> this makes me miss PHP so much more lol
[20:11:00] <robertmaxrees> could be.
[20:11:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry was pulled away.
[20:11:47] <Es0teric> its cool man
[20:11:52] <Es0teric> i just need to take a break
[20:12:02] <Es0teric> probably take a shot, im already at a bar lol robertmaxrees
[20:12:50] <zampa> yeah there is probably some other ajax setting or something i need to set..
[20:14:42] <zampa> ugh why is this so hard >.<
[20:19:07] <robertmaxrees> zampa probably wanna step away for a bit.
[20:19:24] <Es0teric> zampa yeah robertmaxrees is right
[20:23:10] <zampa> i just wish i could isolate it a bit more.
[20:23:23] <robertmaxrees> you could always setup a standalone page and go from there.
[20:23:26] <robertmaxrees> without the extra stuff.
[20:23:32] <robertmaxrees> just jquery, datatables, and your code.
[20:27:52] <latemus> i have defined many functions and variables in multiple files, each within $(document).ready(). will these funcions and variables be within scope in all successively loaded files?
[20:28:11] <robertmaxrees> not accross functions, no.
[20:28:25] <robertmaxrees> functions are only available within the scope they're defined in.
[20:28:32] <robertmaxrees> just like any other object.
[20:29:03] <latemus> robertmaxrees: okay. so the function must appear within the same $(document).read( -->context <-- ) ?
[20:29:19] <latemus> s/read/ready/
[20:29:24] <robertmaxrees> .ready(function() { /* context */ });
[20:29:33] <robertmaxrees> and if you're calling from there, yes.
[20:29:41] <latemus> yes, whoops that's what i meant
[20:29:58] <robertmaxrees> but there's no need to define functions within doc ready.
[20:30:07] <latemus> alright. well, thank you again sir
[20:30:59] <latemus> robertmaxrees: so if i define them without .ready, just a in a plain .js can't i use them within .ready later
[20:31:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:31:17] <latemus> robertmaxrees: :)
[20:31:23] <robertmaxrees> so long as you define it in a "parent" scope, you're solid.
[20:32:05] <latemus> alright, that makes sense. i appreciate your help -- it's been at least a year since i've touched any js / jquery.
[20:32:14] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[20:32:20] <latemus> :)
[20:34:53] <latemus> hm, are jquery methods availabe outside of a .ready(function(){ /* context */ }); ?
[20:35:06] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[20:35:16] <robertmaxrees> they're available anywhere.
[20:35:22] <robertmaxrees> but you said you're defining functions outside of that, right?
[20:35:49] <latemus> can i use .addClass and .css() etc in the functions i define outside of .ready
[20:35:59] <robertmaxrees> are you calling them within the ready?
[20:36:03] <latemus> ahh, yes.
[20:36:06] <latemus> cool
[20:36:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:36:21] <robertmaxrees> the function doesn't get evaluated, so you don't need to wait to define it.
[20:36:23] <latemus> thank you socrates
[20:36:25] <latemus> :)
[20:36:38] <latemus> perfect
[20:46:45] <zampa> i think i made some progress...
[20:46:55] <zampa> I might have localized the problem now.
[20:47:35] <zampa> Sitting in the network manager i actually notice that once i remove the table headers in the html file. I never even get to the ajax request
[20:47:39] <zampa> i actually get an erorr prior to that.
[20:48:21] <zampa> Uncaught Type Error: cannot read property 'aDataSort' of undefined it jquery.dataTables.min.js
[20:52:29] <zampa> Basically datatables complains there are no headers for what it needs to do...
[20:58:00] <w3gi> hallo, i need to set the order before uploading some files
[20:58:48] <w3gi> is there some function which can help me in jquery?
[23:43:22] <w3gi> hi. this line of code makes some troubles... formData.append("dateien[]", $('#dateien')[0].files[x]);
[23:43:46] <w3gi> after nunning this the formData is empty
