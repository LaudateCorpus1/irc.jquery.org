[00:41:01] <ruby_on_tails> if an element has multiple transformations applied, how can i retrieve the translateY() value only using jQuery?
[00:41:44] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: jquery don't natively support transform
[00:42:06] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: so you have to grab a plugin or parse the content of the transform property
[00:42:14] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: hmm
[01:00:13] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/o8y94mz1/ runs on page load, thus an alert. how do I prevent it?
[01:04:44] <Cork> Kartagis: taht code isn't even valid
[01:04:55] <Kartagis> Cork: why?
[01:05:08] <Kartagis> syntex-wise?
[01:05:18] <Kartagis> syntax*
[01:05:22] <Cork> each(, function() {}) } for one
[01:05:36] <Cork> $() with undefined variables as a second
[01:06:09] <Kartagis> Cork: I've defined variables. as for the other issue, it's a typo
[01:06:28] <Cork> Kartagis: the syntax has no meaning to jquery
[01:06:46] <Cork> $() takes an array, an object, a function or a string
[01:06:55] <Cork> not 10+ arguments
[01:07:09] <Cork> (it allowes an optional second object)
[01:08:17] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/o8y94mz1/1/ Cork
[01:08:37] <xec_> still doesnt make any sense
[01:08:40] <Cork> ya
[01:09:04] <Cork> Kartagis: you want to .add() the different jquery variables
[01:09:10] <Cork> $() doens't support this
[01:09:47] <Kartagis> Cork: can I use .apply if I throw them in an array?
[01:10:07] <Cork> Kartagis: no
[01:10:33] <Cork> you could make an array of the dom elements
[01:10:40] <Cork> and pass that array to jquery
[01:10:43] <xec_> you could do [ecoLocalDrop, ecoAirportDrop, ecoAirportPickUp, etc].forEach(function(item){ /* do something with $(item) here */});
[01:10:56] <Cork> $([ $('')[0], $('')[0], $('')[0] ])
[01:11:19] <xec_> actually, no need for the $() inside the callback as it is an array of jquery objects at that point
[01:11:20] <Cork> or simply just merge the selectors into one string
[01:11:43] <Cork> xec_: i don't thin jquery handles arrays of jquery objects when it merges
[01:11:46] <Cork> but i might be wrong
[01:12:02] <xec_> Cork: no merging going on, just a simple array
[01:12:21] <Cork> xec_: it is merging
[01:12:33] <Kartagis> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/o8y94mz1/3/ ?
[01:12:50] <Cork> xec_: your merging [[dom elem], [dom elem], [dom elem], [dom elem]] to [dom elem, dom elem, dom elem, dom elem]
[01:14:14] <xec_> i don't follow
[01:14:16] <Cork> Kartagis: possible
[01:14:23] <xec_> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/o8y94mz1/4/
[01:14:29] <Cork> but you need to have an argument for the jquery object
[01:14:32] <xec_> that's what i was thinking
[01:14:37] <Cork> xec_: jquery is an array of dom elements
[01:14:51] <xec_> Cork: array-like, yes
[01:14:53] <Cork> if you make an array of jquery objects you make a two dimentional array
[01:15:02] <Cork> so when you give that to jquery
[01:15:13] <Cork> if jquery is to handle it correctly it would have to remove the extra array
[01:15:33] <Cork> else the new object be an array of jquery objects
[01:15:36] <Cork> not dom elements
[01:15:37] <xec_> Cork: i'm not giving it to jquery?
[01:15:57] <Cork> xec_: ugg i see where the mixup is
[01:16:06] <Cork> your comment was right after my $([]) comment
[01:16:11] <Cork> but wasn't about my comment -_-'
[01:16:20] <xec_> ahhhh right xD
[01:16:51] <xec_> sorry about the confusion
[01:16:55] <Cork> same here
[01:22:35] <Kartagis> Cork: [ecoLocalDrop, ecoAirportDrop, ecoAirportPickUp...].forEach(function(item) {
[01:22:35] <Kartagis>          if (!isNumber(item).val())) {
[01:22:35] <Kartagis>          alert("Please input only numbers!");
[01:22:35] <Kartagis>          }
[01:22:35] <Kartagis>          }); <--- this gives me unexpected token
[01:22:43] <Kartagis> sorry for the flood
[01:22:57] <Cork> ugg don't post multi line code in the channel...
[01:22:58] <Kartagis> on if line
[01:23:14] <xec_> one ) too many ?
[01:23:32] <Cork> isNumber(item).val() makes no sense
[01:23:40] <xec_> that too
[01:23:49] <Kartagis> that is my function
[01:23:58] <xec_> Kartagis: did you see the demo i posted
[01:24:00] <Cork> also the if case has too many closing parenthesis
[01:24:05] <Kartagis> Cork: you jsfiddled that :o
[01:24:17] <Cork> no i did not
[01:24:23] <Cork> i havne't fiddled anything
[01:24:32] <xec_> no, I jsfiddled something *close* to that, except you introduced some errors :P
[01:24:35] <Cork> (today)
[01:24:57] <Kartagis> Cork: sorry, it was xec_
[01:25:18] <Kartagis> oh, right
[01:25:24] <Kartagis> sorry
[01:25:29] <Kartagis> I see now
[01:25:44] <xec_> try to undestand what it does instead of copying code
[01:27:10] <Kartagis> xec_: I will, once  I finish this I have a deadline on
[01:27:27] <Kartagis> xec_: I'm forking everything though :D
[01:27:57] <Kartagis> xec_: I still get alert on page load
[01:28:16] <Kartagis> xec_: even when I didn't make an input
[01:28:55] <xec_> yeah, the whole thing is badly designed
[01:29:32] <Kartagis> xec_: I'll try to make it more readable later
[01:29:45] <xec_> readable isn't what i'm talking about
[01:29:55] <Kartagis> logic
[01:29:56] <xec_> i'd start again if i was you. mark all the inputs with a specfic class and select on that instead, that way you get a collection that is empty if there are no matches
[01:31:10] <Kartagis> xec_: I'm working on Drupal, so I'm not controlling the output.
[01:31:45] <Cork> xec_: drupal is normally adding a lot of classes
[01:31:53] <Cork> you should be able to find a common for your case
[01:32:28] <Kartagis> Cork: there are textfields beside these, so I can't have one for these
[01:33:10] <xec_> Kartagis: are they marked up exactly the same? no type="number" for instance
[01:34:44] <Kartagis> xec_: they are supposed to be number fields, but I forgot to make them so. so I can't afford a delete/re-add
[01:39:14] <xec_> Kartagis: well, you have all the inputs already so you can work with that. how about you filter them out first
[01:39:26] <xec_> Kartagis: what about something like http://jsfiddle.net/o8y94mz1/5/
[01:39:43] <xec_> sorry forgot to invert it
[01:39:47] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/o8y94mz1/6/
[01:40:13] <Kartagis> xec_: how about I do .addClass?
[01:40:40] <xec_> Kartagis: then you can put in a check for if it exists first http://jsfiddle.net/o8y94mz1/7/
[01:42:15] <Kartagis> xec_: heh, integer fields are marked with a type of text, I checked
[01:42:18] <prohobo> dat regex
[01:44:42] <xec_> i have a meeting. bbl
[02:03:43] <lemonsparrow> hi.. I have a list of <tr> as given here https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f7edcbfc5286d343e05a, what I am looking for is for all <td> which has value Too_large, the href should have /utilization-analysis/117?status=too_large appended to it..
[02:03:57] <lemonsparrow> pls suggest an query approach to do this.
[02:18:51] <davetarmac> hey guys
[02:20:14] <davetarmac> I've got two columns that need to be equal heights, which is fine - except that one of the columns has a bootstrap accordion in there and flows outside of the boundaries of the column - anyone know how to get around this? Here is a fiddle to illustrate the point : http://jsfiddle.net/s8uLG/147/
[02:24:18] <Cork> davetarmac: well they are getting too long for the parent element
[02:24:23] <Cork> what do you want it to do?
[02:24:26] <Cork> crop the overflow?
[02:26:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork, hi.. I have a list of <tr> as given here https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f7edcbfc5286d343e05a, what I am looking for is for all <td> which has value Too_large, the href should have /utilization-analysis/117?status=too_large appended to it..
[02:26:32] <davetarmac> Cork: I want to ideally extend the columns to contain the extended accordion
[02:26:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: please don't highlight me without answering a direct question
[02:27:04] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i might be busy and the highlight can be quite disruptive
[02:27:05] <davetarmac> Cork: otherwise they disappear under and out of the footer
[02:27:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork, sorry.. I am looking for an answer
[02:27:31] <Cork> davetarmac: if they extend they won't be the same height anymore
[02:27:52] <Cork> davetarmac: you could try using display table-cell (needs a parent table-row)
[02:28:08] <Cork> or if your ok with dropping older browsers flexbox
[02:28:22] <davetarmac> needs to support ie8 sadly
[02:28:29] <davetarmac> ok, display table-cell it is then
[02:28:38] <Cork> then display: table-row + display: table-cell
[02:28:39] <davetarmac> thanks for the help, Cork
[02:28:52] <Cork> davetarmac: np
[02:29:06] <davetarmac> does the table row need to be the encompassing .row?
[02:30:03] <Kartagis> why am I getting 'undefined is not a function on line #2?
[02:30:07] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/L32mkLj5/
[02:30:19] <davetarmac> Cork: just tried it on the fiddle but it didn't seem to work. Am I doing something strupidly wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/s8uLG/148/
[02:31:05] <davetarmac> Sorry, I realise this isn't a css channel - so if you prefer I can ask it in there
[02:33:27] <lemonsparrow> It would be great if someone could help me out with the issue..
[02:34:06] <Cork> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/g7k08a7L/
[02:34:10] <Cork> sorry for the delay
[02:34:45] <mattjs5> http://jsfiddle.net/gxe06o78/
[02:34:57] <mattjs5> anyone know why the scrollTop doesn't work on <select>
[02:34:58] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you need to sort on element content you will have to loop the dom
[02:35:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i suggest adding a class instead
[02:35:10] <mattjs5> gets 0 everytime
[02:35:26] <mattjs5> also why on scroll doesnt work in chrome for the <select>
[02:35:40] <Cork> mattjs5: select is replaced elements
[02:35:48] <Cork> don't expect it to follow dom rules
[02:36:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork.. no actually… I have handlebars code for this elements but we cannot do string compare in handlebars right so I thought of adding jquery function to append ?status=too-large to those hyperlinks within <tr> which has a <td> with value too-large
[02:36:19] <mattjs5> Cork: is there a way to get the scrollTop property?
[02:36:25] <mattjs5> from a select
[02:36:37] <Cork> mattjs5: you could replace the <select> element
[02:36:45] <Cork> or file a bug for chrome to add the support
[02:36:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork, its not sorting that I want to do.. but just adding param to the url..
[02:39:14] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/L32mkLj5/ <--- why am I getting 'undefined is not a function' on line #2?
[02:39:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork, hope you got what I am looking for.. its not soring
[02:39:51] <lemonsparrow> sorting*
[02:40:28] <Cork> Kartagis: you do? http://jsfiddle.net/L32mkLj5/1/
[02:40:33] <Cork> works fine here
[02:41:10] <Cork> lemonsparrow: no i have no clue what your looking for
[02:41:32] <Kartagis> Cork: I get that on page load. maybe fiddling with other statements?
[02:41:51] <davetarmac> Cork: unfortunately that method doesn't work because the equal height script adds inline height elements to the columns
[02:41:59] <Cork> Kartagis: most likely your sending something that isn't a string to the function
[02:42:23] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/37f5b024b15a761e3b32 Cork I have several <tr> like that .. whichever <tr> has a <td> with value Too_large, I want to append to the url ?status=too_large
[02:42:39] <Kartagis> Cork: I am getting that on page load, even before I input something
[02:42:47] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you mean to the current pages url?
[02:43:13] <Cork> Kartagis: something is calling the function
[02:43:17] <Cork> else you wouldn't get the error
[02:43:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork, the <td> above itself is a url if you look  /utilization-analysis/117 so I want to append /utilization-analysis/117?status=too_large
[02:43:59] <Kartagis> Cork: something at the end of page is calling it, but I get that on page load,
[02:45:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: link.attr('src', link.attr('src') + $.param({ status: "too_large" }))
[02:45:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: finding it will be the hard part
[02:45:41] <Cork> finding the link i mean
[02:45:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork, yes.. how can I do that ?
[02:45:51] <Cork> that was the original answer i gave you
[02:46:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork, the handlebar code looks like this https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/ed24f3539d8e840a26c2 bt I cannot compare here
[02:47:00] <mattjs5> Kartagis: what do you mean something at the end of the page?
[02:47:29] <Kartagis> mattjs5: let me jsfiddle the whole thing
[02:47:33] <mattjs5> ok
[02:48:02] <Cork> Kartagis: this comes from you copy pasting code instead of understanding the code xec gave you
[02:48:32] <blackkbot> $('*[src*=too_large]') right
[02:48:47] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/jc4wqt10/
[02:48:54] <Cork> blackkbot: he wants to add the params
[02:48:54] <Kartagis> mattjs5: ^
[02:48:56] <Cork> not find it
[02:48:56] <mooncup> I currently have something like this:
[02:49:01] <mooncup> $('.period-selector span b').click(function() {
[02:49:04] <mooncup> if ($(this).is('.psw')) {
[02:49:17] <mooncup> is there a way to trigger that even for .pws specifically?
[02:49:26] <mooncup> will $('.psw').trigger do it?
[02:49:48] <Cork> trigger it for .pws specifically??
[02:49:51] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:50:02] <blackkbot> if(this.classList.contains('psw')) maybe
[02:50:15] <blackkbot> depends if this returns the element or the jquery element
[02:50:19] <Cork> blackkbot: uh... are you even trying to understand the questions?
[02:50:27] <blackkbot> halfway
[02:50:39] <mooncup> 1 sec, I'll paste the whole snippet
[02:50:57] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/n0s8pwjpyjzrfyp1jkvq
[02:51:05] <Cork> mooncup: if you want to fire the click handler for all b elements with the class .psw
[02:51:16] <Cork> $('b.psw').trigger('click') will work
[02:51:18] <mooncup> I'm trying to manually trigger either setFrequency('week'); or setFrequency('month'); etc
[02:51:25] <mooncup> great, thanks
[02:51:30] <mooncup> I shall give it a shot
[02:51:44] <Cork> mooncup: also you prob want to look at delegated event handlers
[02:52:09] <mooncup> I didn't write that snippet
[02:52:14] <mooncup> Id have done it differently
[02:53:08] <blackkbot> wouldn't $('b.psw').click() also work? or does jquery not hook into the click event?
[02:53:24] <blackkbot> oh i see my bad
[02:53:50] <Cork> blackkbot: .click is a shorthand for .trigger('click')
[02:53:53] <Cork> so it is the same thing
[02:54:44] <blackkbot> i thought .click on a jquery object assigned the argument to the click event
[02:55:31] <Cork> thats .click(fn)
[02:55:39] <Cork> *that's
[02:55:55] <blackkbot> hmmm
[02:56:21] <Cork> and you don't assign
[02:56:21] <mattjs5> Kartagis: isNumber(ecoLocalDrop) at the very end
[02:56:24] <blackkbot> optional arguments that change the function
[02:56:25] <Cork> you add an event listener
[02:56:28] <mattjs5> it is being called
[02:56:38] <Cork> assign would be the old dom0 onclick attributes
[02:56:50] <Cork> (those shouldn't be used)
[02:56:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork, any idea pls
[02:57:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i've already answered what you need to do
[02:57:20] <Cork> 1. add a class you can select on
[02:57:28] <Cork> or you will have to loop the doms checking the content
[03:01:01] <mooncup> hm the event doesn't seem to be triggered
[03:01:16] <mooncup> maybe I'll just rewrite the click handler to use the objects directly
[03:01:23] <blackkbot> $('tr > td.is-error  +td>a') because the .is-error class might be good enough
[03:01:36] <mattjs5> Kartagis: that will always be called immediately, it's not binded to an event or anything
[03:02:33] <mattjs5> Kartagis: what is it you are trying to do?
[03:03:21] <blackkbot> "if you don't know where you are going. you might not make it there"
[03:04:00] <Kartagis> mattjs5: I have several textfields, and I want to make sure the user doesn't input non-digits
[03:04:51] <blackkbot> how about decimals?
[03:04:57] <blackkbot> and -?
[03:05:51] <Kartagis> blackkbot: no, only integers
[03:07:30] <mattjs5> so you use that function when the user clicks submit button or on keyup event of the textfield?
[03:07:55] <mattjs5> and then if its true, do something, if false, do something else
[03:08:32] <Kartagis> mattjs5: if non-digit, alert
[03:08:59] <mattjs5> so you want it to check when a button is pressed?
[03:09:07] <Kartagis> mattjs5: input event too
[03:09:15] <mattjs5> so when the use types a key?
[03:09:29] <Kartagis> yes
[03:09:47] <Kartagis> I am advised to use input instead of keyup
[03:10:00] <mattjs5> hmm ok
[03:10:50] <mattjs5> so i guess ill pick one of the fields and add it in the html to of fiddle
[03:11:04] <mattjs5> to test
[03:15:49] <_2_Andyann> hi
[03:16:12] <mattjs5> http://jsfiddle.net/jc4wqt10/1/
[03:16:14] <mattjs5> like that?
[03:20:39] <Kartagis> mattjs5: yea
[03:21:25] <mattjs5> cool
[03:21:33] <mattjs5> you need to modify the regex for ints only
[03:23:52] <ThKo> Hi guys, short question: Do you know a library for creating charts like this (left picture) http://www.denkwerk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cornelsen_Vokabeltrainer_Blog.jpg with jQuery mobile? Thanks :)
[03:25:04] <msg> It's called a donut graph
[03:25:11] <msg> You can do them with highcharts
[03:25:12] <Kartagis> mattjs5: btw, that fiddle gives undefined is not a function
[03:25:21] <ThKo> msg: Thanks Iâ€™ll have a look
[03:25:25] <mattjs5> which one?
[03:25:26] <msg> But i don't know about with/without jQuery mobile
[03:25:33] <msg> certanly standard jQuery though
[03:25:35] <msg> (is needed)
[03:25:41] <msg> Maybe mobile works
[03:25:53] <ThKo> jQuery standard is implemented, jQuery mobile too
[03:25:59] <mattjs5> Kartagis: oh forgot to comment out the function at the end sorry

[03:27:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I already have added a class..
[03:39:34] <MortezaE> Hello, I want to write a bookmarklet for a jQ based social network like FB.com , that prevent loading images of the posts. You know posts are loaded by scrolling page, ajaxificly :) is there an event that is triggered when some content is Inject()-ed into DOM?
[03:39:59] <Cork> MortezaE: no
[03:40:26] <MortezaE> so i must use time intervals, ok?
[03:40:32] <Cork> you would have to try to find the code that does the insertion and try to inject your self there
[03:40:43] <Cork> hopefully no
[03:40:45] <Cork> it might be
[03:41:06] <MortezaE> Cork, and it is impossible in case of bookmarklet, isn't it?
[03:41:14] <Cork> MortezaE: also if your ok with limiting what browsers it work in there is mutation observers
[03:41:26] <Cork> but they arn't implemented in all browsers yet
[03:41:32] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobservers
[03:41:34] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver

[03:50:38] <Ninj> Hi here! When i'm trying to download jQuery-UI with custom-theme, i get a beautiful "Ooops! An unexpected error seems to have occurred. Why not try refreshing your page? Or you can contact us if the problem persists."
[03:52:30] <Ninj> Here's what i do: go on "themes", choose a theme in theme roller, edit it, then click on "download theme", which brings me to the custom download page, select some parts of jQuery-UI only, click "Download" at the bottom.
[03:54:25] <Ninj> does that mean that custom themes are not available anymore?
[03:54:49] <Cork> Ninj: sounds like it's a bug in the themeroller
[03:55:57] <Cork> hmm
[03:56:01] <Cork> can't reproduce it though
[03:56:15] <Cork> i get the download just fine
[03:56:50] <Ninj> Cork: don't know, because that happens after i click download on the "Download builder" page. When i click "Download" on the theme roller, it properly brings me to the Download builder
[03:57:19] <Ninj> here's what i do precisely, and my co-worker too (getting the same bug) :
[03:57:49] <Cork> Ninj: you would have to make an str
[03:57:59] <Cork> cause like i said, can't reproduce
[03:59:09] <Ninj> In theme roller, click gallery, then choose "excite bike" theme. Now, click "edit" under this theme. Customize some options, and click Download. You get on the Download builder page. Now, unselect everything, then check only a few widgets/effects. At the bottom, click Download.
[04:00:10] <Ninj> however, selecting a theme (instead of "custom_theme") in the theme dropbox of the Download builder works fine.
[04:04:50] <Ninj> Cork: an str? bug report?
[04:05:07] <Cork> Ninj: Steps To Reproduce
[04:05:20] <Cork> else it's just a browser config error
[04:05:35] <Ninj> i wrote the str then, some lines up :)
[04:06:57] <vsgill> Hi, I'm getting this on chrome console: GET http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.map 404 (Not Found)
[04:07:01] <vsgill> Any idea how to fix this?
[04:07:08] <vsgill> doesn't happen in firefox
[04:07:38] <Ninj> cork, it's easy! click here and try to download jquery-ui: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!downloadParams=version%3D1.11.2%26components%3D1111101000111110000011000001000100010&zThemeParams=5d000001002606000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e56fef6015a89a811c9e49f38c067c0ec127abdac572a3d95e991a1a04d197f40e3bbcbbd5ebb75c5d025283cced7ebfde8774e8665eb408f4b6d180cee53953aafbe54e4ffa6132df83f9aba1e5a5704e8eff471aef663343d74a4800a41608a
[04:08:14] <Cork> Ninj: can't reproduce
[04:08:20] <Cork> Ninj: what browser are you using?
[04:08:27] <Ninj> FF, Chrome, IE, Safari
[04:09:00] <arschmitz> vsgill: Thats because firefox does not report missing source maps
[04:09:05] <Cork> Ninj: can't reproduce in chrome or firefox
[04:09:10] <Cork> works fine here
[04:09:15] <arschmitz> vsgill: and its missing because thats a bad link
[04:09:27] <Ninj> when i follow the above URl, from any of these browsers, then click on Download from theme roller then Download from download builder, i get the "Ooops"
[04:09:32] <arschmitz> vsgill: your missing the version number
[04:09:35] <Ninj> that's weird
[04:09:42] <Cork> arschmitz: no firefox reports it too
[04:09:54] <Cork> arschmitz: it just doesn't download it unless you enable it
[04:10:32] <vsgill> arschmitz: do you know where I can change it to correct url?
[04:11:24] <arschmitz> vsgill: where did your version of jquery come from?
[04:11:34] <arschmitz> vsgill: it contains the link to the source map
[04:11:39] <ThKo> Hi, I execute the following command for getting the active page of my appâ€¦var activePage = $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer( "getActivePage" ); Is there a way to find out how much pages are before this active page? :-) Thanks
[04:11:47] <Cork> vsgill: the url is the first line in the jquery.min.js file
[04:12:18] <vsgill> Cork: //code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js
[04:12:22] <vsgill> aha
[04:12:25] <vsgill> okay let me check it
[04:12:40] <Cork> hmm
[04:12:47] <vsgill> but does that mean, i need to change it every time?
[04:12:49] <Cork> last line now days i see
[04:13:10] <Cork> vsgill: or just make sure you serv it on the location it directs
[04:18:01] <vsgill> Cork: I have just disabled source map in dev tool, is that alright to do?
[04:18:27] <Cork> vsgill: sure
[04:18:45] <vsgill> cool thanks
[04:19:01] <Cork> it just means viewing the minified version in the browsers source view will just show you the minified source code
[04:19:08] <Cork> instead of expanding it to the original code
[04:19:36] <vsgill> aha alright, thanks

[04:48:49] <Mark_____> HELLO!
[04:49:24] <Kartagis> DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU NOT TO TYPE IN CAPS?
[04:49:26] <Kartagis> lol
[04:51:08] <VectorX> Kartagis if you dont want any other character being typed perhaps keypress is the event you want
[04:51:32] <Mark_____> *U!
[04:51:51] <Mark_____> i just wanted to say hello to everyone here hoping that i wake up a few people.
[04:51:57] <Kartagis> VectorX: it also does that
[04:52:17] <Kartagis> *sigh*
[04:52:20] <Mark_____> im fixing my broken website.

[05:07:34] <Kartagis> VectorX: thanks a lot, I was looking for exactly this :)
[05:08:18] <VectorX> yeah, was a bit sad to see you ask the same question in here for a couple of days now
[05:08:30] <VectorX> would have thought somebody would have helped you already
[05:08:35] <pothepanda> hi im jquery newbie, im trying to submit a form after event.preventDefault() can anyone point me to a direction ?
[05:08:49] <Kartagis> VectorX: one more thing. instead of writing isNumber(field) 54 times, is there a better way?
[05:09:25] <VectorX> Kartagis i have done it the better way, that is applied to a class, so give a class name to the inputs and use it
[05:09:54] <Kartagis> VectorX: output is unfortunately out of my hands
[05:10:08] <VectorX> <input class="input someformat checknumber">   $('.checknumber').keypress(function (event) {
[05:10:27] <VectorX> if not find some characteristic of the input and apply the event to it
[05:12:55] <Kartagis> VectorX: I've checked, no characteristics :S
[05:14:14] <VectorX> Kartagis its hard to help since i dont know what html you are working and the problem
[05:17:42] <Kartagis> VectorX: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11918318/Screenshot%20from%202014-10-20%2015%3A16%3A55.png
[05:18:27] <VectorX> and you cant change the html ?
[05:19:01] <Kartagis> VectorX: don't know how to yet. I have to fiddle with the template
[05:19:45] <VectorX> then do it, add the same class to the ones that are only numbers,  ie required"  required numonly"
[05:20:06] <VectorX> then $('.numonly').keypress(function (event) {
[05:20:10] <VectorX> and you are done
[05:20:20] <VectorX> i got to go anyway
[05:20:31] <VectorX> you have the solution
[05:28:34] <Koopz> what are people using for form cloning?
[05:29:09] <Koopz> i used to use this plugin here http://www.mdelrosso.com/sheepit/index.php?lng=en_GB but the development has stopped for more than 2 years now
[05:33:56] <Kartagis> how is it possible to calculate the difference of dates between two datepicker fields?
[05:55:51] <Kartagis> why doesn't something that works on jsfiddle work on the page?
[05:56:07] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/3czuq9pn/
[05:56:49] <xec_> because something is different. don't be a help vampire :P
[05:58:07] <M3diator> Something is bugged on my js, the slide() has its own will when its about changing effects
[05:59:05] <Kartagis> xec_: I have no intention to be, I'm on a tight schedule here
[05:59:08] <M3diator> it opens fast and closes slow with fold easing, doenst matter what a set
[06:01:27] <Kartagis> xec_: I have copied the code exactly
[06:02:59] <xec_> Kartagis: then something else is different. also, .val() returns a string. i assume you want to compare numbers?
[06:03:15] <Kartagis> xec_: yes
[06:03:32] <xec_> Kartagis: "4" > "12" for instance
[06:03:37] <Kartagis> xec_: parseInt?
[06:03:40] <xec_> ye
[06:05:59] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/3czuq9pn/2/ ?
[06:07:06] <Kartagis> unbelievable
[06:07:11] <xec_> looks okay to me (at a glance)
[06:07:33] <xec_> another thing though, closingKm is already jquery, no need to wrap it in $()
[06:07:48] <xec_> just do closingKm.on("blur", func...)
[06:08:07] <xec_> ("bind "is the old method, "on" is the new)
[07:59:29] <Kartagis> am I listening to the wrong event? isn't it blur() ?
[08:02:47] <Kartagis> could it be blur has been deprecated at some point? there is no other explanation
[08:04:01] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: blur isn't going anywhere for a long, long time. What's the issue?
[08:04:39] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: I've got it working in jsfiddle, but not on my website for the life of me
[08:07:19] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: please gp to http://seyonrentacar.p2ptechsolutions.com/node/add/booking, choose closed from the status and fill in the opening km and closing km fields. for the sake of argument, make closing km less
[08:08:51] <BillCriswell> Ok. what's the issue?
[08:10:42] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: when you blur out the closing kilometer, it should alert
[08:10:50] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:10:55] <BillCriswell> It does.
[08:11:06] <jyraff> hello. how to appear menu better? http://jsfiddle.net/a3dw6p4w/
[08:11:07] <Kartagis> what? not for me
[08:11:15] <Kartagis> what does it say?
[08:11:35] <BillCriswell> "Closing kilommeter can't be less than opening kilometer!"
[08:11:45] <Kartagis> og
[08:11:58] <Kartagis> any reason it doesn't alert for me?
[08:12:33] <BillCriswell> Are you in Chrome? May have ticked the box to not allow alerts anymore.
[08:12:53] <Kartagis> ouch
[08:12:59] <Kartagis> yes I did
[08:13:22] * Kartagis headdesks till he bleeds
[08:13:37] <BillCriswell> Another good argument for console.log instead of alert
[08:13:46] <Kartagis> I have been wondering for hours why it doesn't work
[08:14:24] * Kartagis notes do NOT use "alert" for debugging
[08:15:20] <bbclover> hey guys if I do $('#someid').checked = true; for some checkbox will that set it to true?
[08:16:05] <jphase> $('#someid').prop('checked', true);
[08:16:57] <bbclover> jphase what I did doesn't work?
[08:17:07] <BillCriswell> bbclover: No.
[08:17:58] <BillCriswell> $('#someid').get().checked = true; would, checked is property of the element, not of the jQuery object.
[08:18:15] <bbclover> what about document.getElementById("checkboxidr").checked = true
[08:18:24] <bbclover> I guess that's javascript?
[08:18:31] <BillCriswell> Yes, that would work.
[08:18:38] <decx> google "difference between jquery object and a javascript object"
[08:18:54] <bbclover> can u pls google it for me and tell me
[08:19:16] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: how to undo that? or can I?
[08:19:30] <jphase> lol
[08:20:07] <jphase> bbclover: http://lmgtfy.com/?s=difference%20between%20jquery%20object%20and%20a%20javascript%20object
[08:20:27] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: I think you have to close the tab and reopen it.
[08:20:29] <jphase> whoops:   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=difference%20between%20jquery%20object%20and%20a%20javascript%20object
[08:20:34] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Not positive though.
[08:20:59] <bbclover> ty
[08:21:12] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: yea, that worked
[08:21:20] <Kartagis> BillCriswell++
[08:24:43] <Macaveli> How can you give focus to an H1?
[08:27:08] <decx> you look at it
[08:27:37] <jphase> lol
[08:27:49] <decx> if that doesnt work you should check an optometrist
[08:28:09] <Kartagis> :D
[08:28:13] <decx> also, only form elements can be focused
[08:28:39] <decx> and frames i guess
[08:29:47] <jphase> Macaveli: perhaps you could scroll the user to the top offset of that h1 though if you wanted
[08:48:10] <BillCriswell> decx: and links.
[08:54:10] <Katharsis> did you use jquery cookie js?
[08:54:24] <Katharsis> after refreshing a view, cookie is gone
[08:54:34] <Katharsis> id used $.cookie("language_id", language_id, { expires: 365 });
[08:54:38] <Katharsis> I used*
[08:56:49] <Kartagis> weird thing. the element exists on the page, I set the variable, but it is not available in the console
[08:58:44] <Kartagis> why could this be happening?
[08:59:18] <robertmaxrees> need more info - any errors?  how are you setting the variable?  etc.
[09:00:49] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: no errors? I set it like var openingDate = $("#edit-field-dates-allotted-und-0-value-datepicker-popup-0"), closingDate = $("#edit-field-dates-allotted-und-0-value2-datepicker-popup-0"); actually, none of the vars are available now
[09:01:08] <robertmaxrees> sure, but are you declaring those inside a function?>
[09:01:20] <robertmaxrees> sharing some code would be helpful here.
[09:01:54] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: jQuery(document).ready(function() { ... });
[09:02:09] <robertmaxrees> anything declared in there won't be available outside of it.
[09:02:20] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: but it used to be available one minute ago
[09:02:30] <robertmaxrees> then you had something incorrectly declared.
[09:02:45] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: the whole thing is in that function
[09:02:58] <robertmaxrees> right - you can't try to access variables created within that via the console.
[09:03:48] <Kartagis> uhm
[09:03:52] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: but it used to be available one minute ago
[09:04:06] <robertmaxrees> then you had an error :)  mind pasting some code?
[09:04:21] <Kartagis> along with the html?
[09:04:31] <robertmaxrees> if it's relevant sure.
[09:05:23] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/712a38k8/
[09:06:11] <robertmaxrees> so you're running this and then opening your console and trying to console.log() any of the vars in the if block?
[09:07:46] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/712a38k8/2/
[09:07:49] <Kartagis> yeah
[09:07:55] <Kartagis> I was able to
[09:08:43] <robertmaxrees> if you omitted the var keyword or had another similar error, that's why.
[09:09:32] <Kartagis> I was trying to use the var, eg openingDate
[09:10:35] <robertmaxrees> I think we're crossing wires here - you can place a console.log() within that scope and it'll work.  you cannot, however, run that code, then open your console and type in those variable names to see what they are.
[09:10:56] <Kartagis> uhm
[09:13:07] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: however, if I replace , with ; at the end of opening* and closing* lines
[09:13:14] <Kartagis> I can access
[09:13:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:13:17] <marandi> hi guys , how can i select a div who hast "section" word in id and has "hide" class with jquery ?
[09:13:23] <robertmaxrees> because those variables are no longer properly declared.
[09:13:30] <robertmaxrees> the engine makes them global for you, which is bad.
[09:14:02] <Kartagis> so, with proper definition, I shouldn't be able to access
[09:14:07] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:14:18] <robertmaxrees> functions in js create scope.
[09:14:35] <Kartagis> which is var foo = bar,era=wtf;
[09:14:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:14:49] <robertmaxrees> you cannot access those vars outside of that function.
[09:37:37] <seaders> Hey guys, simple question - how to make jQuery Mobil inset collapsibles look like collapsibles in a collapsibleset? http://jsfiddle.net/L14z0x12/5/
[09:43:24] <JaMz> hello
[09:44:42] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[09:44:54] <JaMz> good morning!
[09:45:15] <seaders> Anyone around to help a relative newbie (re collapsibles)?  Should be a fairly easy solve to anyone with a bit of experience.
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ seaders
[09:45:24] <b-ot> seaders: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:45:49] <JaMz> Have any one have this problem... keep getting error and not the success... but the script in firebug is actually getting the site!  http://jsbin.com/viyadenuqa/1/
[09:46:33] <seaders> I can't figure out how to make jQuery Mobile inset collapsibles look like collapsibles in a collapsibleset - http://jsfiddle.net/L14z0x12/5/
[09:46:48] <robertmaxrees> JaMz I'm seeing errors in the console.
[09:47:31] <robertmaxrees> also, you want .done() and .fail() instead of success and error.
[09:47:34] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: look at the net tab... youre actually GETting the response...
[09:47:46] <robertmaxrees> sure - that doens't mean everything is successfully running.
[09:48:37] <robertmaxrees> looks like they're returning an invaldid response.
[09:48:39] <robertmaxrees> *invalid
[09:49:52] <robertmaxrees> also: dataType: 'jsonp html', is incorrect.  you can only pass one iirc.
[09:51:10] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: in the api says that i can convert the result to any type...As of jQuery 1.5, jQuery can convert a dataType from what it received in the Content-Type header to what you require.
[09:52:44] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what that means.
[09:53:45] <robertmaxrees> while you are correct, jsonp html is going to give you parse errors like you're getting now.
[09:53:48] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: youre right... only apply for space separated results...
[09:54:25] <JaMz> applies*
[09:54:41] <robertmaxrees> plus CL doesn't like people accessing their stuff through third party interfaces like that,
[09:55:50] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: I think so... but I want to try something... Do you have a workaround on this weird response???
[09:56:45] <robertmaxrees> by having your server do the request instead and then watch when they block you ;)
[09:56:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[09:57:20] <JaMz> Just to parse it...
[09:57:25] <JaMz> to parse the response...
[09:57:35] <robertmaxrees> then you need to do it via your server, not page.
[09:57:47] <robertmaxrees> cross-domain is your problem here.
[09:57:53] <JaMz> yes it is...
[09:58:09] <JaMz> but somehow with that datatype it works
[09:58:33] <JaMz> everything else... CORS error...
[09:58:37] <robertmaxrees> errr, that dataype is still broken - you're getting a parse error because what you're getting isn't JSONP.
[09:58:55] <robertmaxrees> you could keep playing around OR just do it server-side.
[09:59:00] <JaMz> which is actually normal (the CORS)
[09:59:53] <JaMz> well... I think I will try few more ideas... but its almost logic that its not going to work...
[10:00:01] <JaMz> but maybe theres a way...
[10:00:41] <robertmaxrees> you could try reading it as text and then converting it later.
[10:00:47] <robertmaxrees> what about the response are you trying to "parse"?
[10:01:16] <JaMz> all the page..
[10:01:30] <JaMz> well... the values of the form...
[10:02:01] <JaMz> as datatype = text... the response is CORS...
[10:02:18] <robertmaxrees> err, the request is blocked because of CORS.
[10:02:32] <robertmaxrees> this is really something you should do server-side.  what's all of this for?  why does it need to be client-side?
[10:02:55] <JaMz> my mistake...youre right, as datatype text, the request is blocked
[10:04:12] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: if I more than one post from same IP, same category in the same 24 hrs they block me... so I want to do it from diff locations... so... client-side
[10:04:22] <JaMz> if I do more...*
[10:04:56] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not the limitation.  it'd still make more sense to do it server-side and proxy through geographically diverse boxes.
[10:04:59] <JaMz> just do the script and ask friend to click on a button to post it from diff IP
[10:05:00] <robertmaxrees> though that'll still piss them off.
[10:05:15] <robertmaxrees> the smarter way is to create a bookmarklet or browser plugin instead.
[10:05:39] <robertmaxrees> or do it through a server.  you're not going to be able to post to their form the way you want to.
[10:08:31] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/760hu84g/1/ -> I'm getting an unexpected token function in this script. I can't seem to figure out why though. My initial though would be a syntax issue but I'm not seeing anything.
[10:08:52] <robertmaxrees> on what line?
[10:09:19] <JaMz> thank for your advice robertmaxrees...
[10:10:02] <robertmaxrees> JaMz i worked at a place that solved that problem, so i speak from experience ;)
[10:11:21] <b-lew> freaking magnolia is compressing it. I can't tell what line. driving me bonkers.
[10:11:40] <robertmaxrees> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/760hu84g/2/
[10:13:30] <b-lew> uploading now.
[10:15:48] <b-lew> this is what the error says, "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function (index):790(anonymous function) (index):790deferred.resolveWith jquery.js:995jQuery.extend.ready jquery.js:428DOMContentLoaded"
[10:15:56] <b-lew> but that doesn't make much sense to me.
[10:16:10] <robertmaxrees> I'd have to see everything together
[10:16:47] <Kartagis> do I need to use input with a datepicker?
[10:17:25] <b-lew> I wonder if its because I'm using jquery 1.6
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> b-lew yep.
[10:17:33] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[10:17:35] <b-lew> unable to update right now.
[10:17:41] <b-lew> great...
[10:17:44] <robertmaxrees> .on() didn't exist yet.
[10:17:52] <b-lew> well at least we know the issue.
[10:18:12] <b-lew> so all of my on(click ) functions are dead.
[10:18:18] <robertmaxrees> b-lew try .bind() instead.
[10:18:29] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis yes.
[10:18:58] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis well, at least normally.  you can custom wire stuff together if you'd like.
[10:19:25] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline is an example without an input.
[10:28:15] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: where do you work ??
[10:28:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't work for that company any more.
[10:28:34] <JaMz> oooo...
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> that was years ago.
[10:28:53] <JaMz> did you work for CL? hahaha
[10:29:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:29:51] <robertmaxrees> we did a lot of different things, but one of our products was for auto dealers - we'd get their data together and then had people post it to craigslist for them.
[10:30:28] <banister> anyone here familiar with the jquery-ui autocomplete plugin?
[10:31:00] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis we built a posting tool so our folks could basically autopopulate the craigslist posting stuff.
[10:31:04] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: nice...
[10:31:11] <robertmaxrees> err, JaMz
[10:31:23] <Kartagis> :D
[10:31:27] <robertmaxrees> sorry :D
[10:31:32] <JaMz> yeah like the aggregators...
[10:31:38] <Kartagis> np
[10:31:41] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:32:18] <JaMz> yes
[10:32:28] <robertmaxrees> "aggregators"?  like who?
[10:32:44] <robertmaxrees> oh, those search sites?
[10:34:14] <robertmaxrees> nothing like that actually.
[10:35:51] <b-lew> thanks for the help!
[10:36:01] <b-lew> still having issues but I think I can work them out hopefully.
[10:36:06] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[10:36:23] <robertmaxrees> you can check the API docs and they'll tell you usually what changed in which versions.
[10:38:12] <JaMz> robertmaxrees: no, agregators like broadbean or equest
[10:38:55] <robertmaxrees> never heard those called "aggregators".  but yeah kind of like that,
[10:39:15] <JaMz> they autopost to many sites..
[10:39:30] <robertmaxrees> right - they don't aggregate data from many places.
[10:40:02] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, it did something like those, but for cars instead.
[10:40:18] <JaMz> nice...
[10:49:45] <xebra> hi, I have read that synchronous ajax requests are deprecated, and callbacks should be used. But if you need to rely on several callbacks (stuff must run after other stuff, which in turn must run after other stuff, and so on), what is the best way to do it?
[10:49:58] <robertmaxrees> callbacks on callback,.
[10:50:02] <robertmaxrees> *callbakcs
[10:50:12] <robertmaxrees> i cannot type today haha.  you get what i mean.
[10:50:42] <xebra> I would have a "chain" of functions with callbacks, then. Is that the "standard" way to do it? Are there any guidelines?
[10:50:53] <robertmaxrees> the hacky way is to put all your sequential logic into the .done() callback and go to town.
[10:51:21] <robertmaxrees> read this to avoid bad design decisions: http://callbackhell.com/
[10:51:57] <xebra> asynchronous logic makes code look messy, lol. Damn asynchronousness.
[10:52:03] <Paradisee> hello o/
[10:52:10] <Paradisee> i have a cool question for you
[10:52:19] <robertmaxrees> xebra it's actually really easy to manage and look not messy.
[10:52:29] <robertmaxrees> keep your functions small and give them good names,
[10:53:07] <xebra> robertmaxrees, I'll read that link, thanks
[10:54:45] <Paradisee> i have a json file where i store some values...i made a function that when i drag and drop an element inside a container (div) the element will be added to the json file, by adding: position relative to the div, the state etc, etc...the problem is: each element i add has to have a unique id taken somewhere, how would you do that? is a good idea to store those ids in the json and give them to the elements each time they will be added, or do you have other
[10:54:45] <Paradisee> suggestions?
[10:55:26] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee use the ID or a data attribute.
[10:55:29] <Paradisee> this is an example of the json: http://dpaste.com/38ATEC1
[10:55:59] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: the ids can be different
[10:56:03] <Paradisee> i mean:
[10:56:12] <Paradisee> do you know the raspberry pi or the arduino?
[10:56:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any reference to either of those things in your sample.
[10:56:37] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: there arent, i have to make it yet
[10:56:51] <robertmaxrees> relate your question to your sample data then.
[10:57:00] <Paradisee> i need to store a list of possible id
[10:57:12] <Paradisee> and use them as id
[10:57:18] <Paradisee> what do you suggest?
[10:57:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're trying to ask hahaha.
[10:57:28] <Paradisee> should i add those id in the json?
[10:57:44] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ill try to be clear as possible
[10:58:00] <Paradisee> i have a microcontroller, you can check it on google: raspberry pi b+
[10:58:08] <Paradisee> it has some output pins
[10:58:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to relate entries in your JSON back to your markup?
[10:58:17] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: yes
[10:58:20] <Paradisee> well...
[10:58:23] <Paradisee> not really..
[10:58:32] <Paradisee> i need to find a good way to do what i need to do
[10:59:06] <intothev01d> do the json objects not have any unique identifiers already?
[10:59:18] <Paradisee> yes intothev01d
[10:59:22] <Paradisee> they got an id
[10:59:26] <robertmaxrees> where?
[10:59:35] <Paradisee> in this case i have: tv_1 and light_2
[10:59:42] <robertmaxrees> then juse use that.
[10:59:46] <intothev01d> ^
[10:59:49] <Paradisee> i  can't
[10:59:51] <robertmaxrees> why?]
[11:00:09] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: cus i need a string to be like: 'GPIO_1'
[11:00:19] <Paradisee> so i can easly read it with python
[11:00:43] <robertmaxrees> then either output your JSON with that data, or use a dict in your python to map that relationship.
[11:00:50] <bbclover> is try.jquery great for learning jquerY?
[11:00:55] <Paradisee> each element of the json file, have to have those kind of string
[11:01:00] <bbclover> It seems much more challenging than codecademy
[11:01:11] <robertmaxrees> bbclover it's a good resource, yeah.  there's also learn.jquery.com
[11:01:18] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: the dict wouldn't be a good idea
[11:01:26] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you need to map one name to another.
[11:01:29] <robertmaxrees> key/value pairs.  bam.
[11:01:46] <Paradisee> exactly, but there's not a good idea, when i can easly put the id as GPIO_1
[11:01:48] <bbclover> robertmaxrees, yeah, but that's not interactive like, "do this" right?
[11:01:49] <robertmaxrees> either provide that unique ID in your JSON or do it in your backend.
[11:01:56] <robertmaxrees> bbclover nope.
[11:02:26] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ill give a go..
[11:02:31] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee extend your JSON - under light_2, add a property like uniqueID or whatever and give it your value.
[11:02:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to map that relationship somewhere.
[11:02:47] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: yes robert, that's my intention
[11:02:56] <Paradisee> but where could i store those values?
[11:03:02] <bbclover> robertmaxrees nope it's not interactive or is there some problems on the site like try.jquery?
[11:03:03] <robertmaxrees> in your JSON or in your backen.
[11:03:11] <Paradisee> o
[11:03:12] <Paradisee> k
[11:03:21] <robertmaxrees> bbclover nope it's not interactive.
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> bbclover different things work for different people, so it's all about what helps you learn.
[11:04:54] <subone> Having trouble with an animation on an element with height auto: It works fine if I let the animation play out, setting the height properly back to auto (technically it looks like it adds inline style and then remoces all inline style after), but if I interrupt it (for example if I have a drop down menu that slides down on hover main menu item, and slides up when the mouse leaves the menu, but I move the mouse out before the mou
[11:05:01] <bbclover> wow this try jquery is part of code school which has a whole bunch of courses robertmaxrees!
[11:05:19] <robertmaxrees> bbclover fsho.
[11:05:20] <subone> Anyone have any idea how to fix that?
[11:05:36] <robertmaxrees> subone you got cut off - can you setup a fiddle?
[11:05:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to use .stop() either way.
[11:05:51] <subone> I am using stop
[11:05:55] <subone> stop(true)
[11:06:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code then.
[11:06:07] <subone> one sec
[11:12:59] <subone> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/98hbq8zo/
[11:13:34] <Kartagis> okay, I have two datepicker fields, and one number of days field. I can't get the result to be printed in a textfield. http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/j0h6oups/ holds the replica of the code, minus the HTML. what am I missing?
[11:14:21] <subone> robertmaxrees: note that clicking the toggle link and waiting til it is done the animation, then clicking it again is fine, can add new elements and height updates appropriately... but if I click quickly so that I am calling stop(true) in the middle of the animation the height gets stuck and adding elements to it afterwards results in overflow
[11:14:23] <Kartagis> result being number of days in between and textfield is number of days field
[11:15:10] <subone> the stuck height is set in an inline style
[11:15:11] <MikeSee> That feeling when your code finally works... ahhhhhh.
[11:15:36] <respek> 'tis a lovely thing
[11:15:43] <Kartagis> indeed
[11:15:59] <subone> Anyone else know how to fix this?
[11:16:50] <robertmaxrees> subone sorry, looking now.
[11:17:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/98hbq8zo/1/ you just want .stop(), not .stop(true)
[11:18:18] <subone> but if I do that the animation continues regardless that I'm done with it.... in other words, if I click several times quickly, I can sit back and watch several iterations of the animation catch up
[11:18:37] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: something like this ? http://dpaste.com/0RXHWXE
[11:18:43] <robertmaxrees> subone not that i'm seeing.
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i'm very confused about what you need.  in this example, do you need light_1 to tie back to some kind of unique ID?
[11:20:37] <subone> checking...
[11:20:44] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: just check the json
[11:21:12] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i'm not doing nothing with the light actually, just making the construct more solid
[11:21:19] <Kartagis> okay, I have two datepicker fields, and one number of days field. I can't get the number of days in between to be printed in the textfield. http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/j0h6oups/ holds the replica of the code, minus the HTML. what am I missing?
[11:21:43] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i did... I don't understand what you need so I can't really say if it'll fulfill your needs.  if your frontend doesn't need to use this list, don't ship it in the JSON./
[11:22:17] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: "RPI_B+": [3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13] this will give the id to each element
[11:22:18] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that's not valid JS.
[11:22:31] <subone> robertmaxrees: looks like you're right, removed the param to stop() and it doesnt continue the animations... but the problem is the same, still gets stuck height
[11:22:35] <Paradisee> i still have to make the code
[11:22:52] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i don't know how to help you.  good luck.
[11:23:00] <Paradisee> lal
[11:23:32] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: everything except lines 16 and 17 work
[11:23:45] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis right - because that whole section is invalid JS.
[11:23:53] <subone> robertmaxrees: the inline style gets "display: block; height: 216px; padding-top: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"
[11:24:05] <subone> after which appending elements overflows
[11:24:11] <robertmaxrees> oh wait nvm Kartagis i see it now.
[11:24:15] <robertmaxrees> subone one sec.
[11:24:30] <Kartagis> the great robertmaxrees ;)
[11:25:34] <robertmaxrees> subone you'd have to do something like this: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/animate-heightwidth-to-auto/
[11:26:24] <subone> So I would have to know it is auto?
[11:26:27] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis do a typeof on new Date(closingDate) and new Date(openingDate) - what do you get?
[11:28:11] <Kartagis> object
[11:28:45] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[11:28:46] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: object
[11:29:12] <Kartagis> can't do math on objects?
[11:29:22] <robertmaxrees> you can do math on numbers.
[11:29:31] <robertmaxrees> but not on date objects.
[11:29:39] <Kartagis> so, I need to parseInt?
[11:30:21] <robertmaxrees> console.log() tose calls to the Date() constructor
[11:30:41] <subone> robertmaxrees: I don't think this is helpful. For one thing, I can animate auto.... that works just fine, but if I don't let the animation finish it does not remove the inline styles it added. If there were a way I could force this removal after my slideUp finished...
[11:31:16] <subone> That is... call something in jQuery that will remove what it added, not just all style
[11:31:20] <snow_blind> hello everyone
[11:31:28] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis are you trying to get the difference between each date?
[11:31:33] <Kartagis> yeah
[11:31:44] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: If you're doing more than one thing with a date use moment.js
[11:32:26] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: I need only the number of days
[11:32:29] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis yeah use moment for this.  otherwise you're looking at stuff like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763327/how-to-calculate-date-difference-in-javascript
[11:32:46] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: yes I am
[11:32:58] <snow_blind> I'm new to programming and have a problem with a small java, whenever someone has a chance
[11:33:04] <robertmaxrees> snow_blind wrong channel.
[11:33:18] <robertmaxrees> javascript and java have nothing to do with one another.
[11:33:57] <snow_blind> My apologies, I didn't realize I was in a java script channel.
[11:34:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a javascript library :)
[11:34:14] <BillCriswell> moment('2014-04-03').diff('2014-05-03', 'days') -> -30
[11:34:32] <robertmaxrees> snow_blind head over to ##java
[11:34:41] <snow_blind> yeah, I'm an idiot. I realized it after you said wrong channel.
[11:34:48] <robertmaxrees> nah, you're not ;)
[11:34:57] <snow_blind> Thank you for the tip!
[11:34:57] <BillCriswell> Sun is the real jerk.
[11:44:52] <caraconan> Hi there. If I copy/paste the code that I generate dynamically with JQM it works (meaning CSS popup is ok). http://paste.debian.net/127787/ There's anything wrong in the code? Thanks
[11:45:22] <caraconan> The code works, but the CSS is broken. Developing with cordova + JQM
[11:48:08] <caraconan> I'll have a look to this example http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Ar8N3/
[11:49:43] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: are you there? how can I do this moment.js?
[11:49:57] <Kartagis> I can't spend time to do it with
[11:51:43] <msafi1> Hi
[11:52:11] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i'm kicking around but doing some other stuff.  what do you mean you "can't spend time to do it with"?
[11:52:12] <msafi1> How can I register an event on an input field that will get fired when I do inputElement.val('foobar')
[11:52:14] <monk12> hey all, i want to load a portion of html to the end of my body tag that has script tags and img tags (pixel firing). I have them in 5 separate files, cause we have 5 separate domains that poiont to the same content/folder.  but I'd like with jquery to load a domain1.include,domain2.include,etc  dynamically on the client-side depending on the website.
[11:52:15] <msafi1> ?
[11:52:26] <robertmaxrees> msafi1 you can .trigger() the event you want manually.
[11:52:39] <monk12> I could use a server side include but would be kinda annoying as we could have these websites on jsp/php/etc.
[11:52:39] <msafi1> robertmaxrees: yes, I'm looking for a more seamless solution
[11:52:44] <Kartagis> I can't spend time to do it with moment.js. how can I do it without?
[11:52:50] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: ^
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis use the example i sent you from SO.
[11:53:20] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I can calculate, just can't print
[11:55:47] <bbclover> hey guys #jquery is listed as an additional resource for learn.jquery.com!
[11:56:00] <bbclover> this is official
[11:56:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:56:06] <bbclover> wow
[11:56:16] <bbclover> I didn't even realize the absense of the #
[11:56:19] <robertmaxrees> also listed here: http://irc.jquery.org/
[12:32:05] <Kartagis> hi
[12:32:15] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: unfortunate
[12:32:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:32:32] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: unfortunately, still can't do it :S
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting stuck?
[12:33:37] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: in the console, I'm getting the value, just can't set .val()
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> "can't set .val()" on what?
[12:34:48] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: the "number of days" textfield
[12:34:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it yo.
[12:36:02] <Kartagis> one sec
[12:39:11] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: please go to http://seyonrentacar.p2ptechsolutions.com/node/add/booking, change the status to closed
[12:40:10] <robertmaxrees> and then what?
[12:40:48] <Kartagis> fill in the dates allotted from and to fields
[12:42:23] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to fill in the Number of Days field when those are filled?
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> where is the JS for that?
[12:42:28] <Kartagis> yea
[12:43:21] <Kartagis> numberOfDays.val(eDate.diff(sDate, 'days'));
[12:43:30] <robertmaxrees> where can I find the relevant JS?
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> this is why fiddles are so helpful btw.
[12:44:27] <Kartagis> I can't replicate a datepicker in jsfiddle, I've tried
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[12:44:53] <robertmaxrees> just need to include jquery and jquery ui.
[12:46:12] <MarkyC> Say I have a submit function: $('#foo').submit(...). If in this submit function I run a callback, which calls submit on foo, I get an infinite loop. If I call unbind() then submit(), I have to click submit twice. How can I have the callback call submit() automatically for me?
[12:46:22] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis http://i.imgur.com/c8YeISR.png
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC are you validating the form?
[12:46:55] <NoiseEee> MarkyC: why are you calling submit from within the function?!
[12:47:03] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee they're probably validating the form.
[12:47:08] <__joshua__> datepicker: http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/6010/
[12:47:23] <NoiseEee> MarkyC: ah if thats the case, then just preventDefault() if its not 'valid'
[12:47:23] <MarkyC> NoiseEee: Tokenizing a credit card, using an AJAX call, before submitting the form
[12:47:51] <robertmaxrees> __joshua__ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xBB5x/6012/ without the external resources.
[12:47:53] <NoiseEee> MarkyC: then preventDefault() right away, and have your XHR response submit the form
[12:48:02] <NoiseEee> s/xhr response/xhr success handler
[12:48:12] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: yes, I have to verify some stuff before submitting the form
[12:48:17] <MarkyC> NoiseEee: That's exactly what I do
[12:49:06] <Kartagis> it seems moment.js is not loading the first time page loads
[12:49:19] <NoiseEee> MarkyC: so whats the issue
[12:49:23] <Kartagis> anyway, I'll log back in when I get home
[12:49:26] <Kartagis> bbl
[12:49:57] <MarkyC> NoiseEee: So in mt success handler I call $form.unbind().submit(); This doesn't submit the form (if I click the submit button again, it does)
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ MarkyC
[12:50:11] <b-ot> MarkyC: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:50:12] <NoiseEee> why are you calling unbind at all?
[12:50:17] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here.
[12:50:28] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: I'll try to get an SSCCE running here
[13:05:24] <Absolute0> How can I select all elements that have something inside them? <div>foo</div> will match; <div></div> will not.
[13:05:52] <NoiseEee> :empty but its an expensive operation in general
[13:06:21] <Absolute0> expensive exshmenshiv
[13:08:18] <Absolute0> is there a non-expensive version of :not(:empty)?
[13:09:39] <NoiseEee> well :parent but by its nature its expensive right?
[13:09:44] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/e5su1L94/
[13:10:15] <Absolute0> how does that work?
[13:10:30] <NoiseEee> the :parent selector is the inverse of :empty
[13:10:35] <Absolute0> ah
[13:11:15] <Absolute0> oh, as in, "is a parent"
[13:11:26] <NoiseEee> yeo
[13:11:28] <Absolute0> It sounds equivalent to .parent()
[13:11:29] <NoiseEee> yep
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> wooo mondays
[13:55:44] <thebope> best day of the week right
[13:56:07] <Omar-> haha
[13:56:19] <Omar-> problems appear before week ends
[14:48:56] <MarioD> Hey guys, noob question. How can I select this element and change the text on it using jQuery in this example? http://jsfiddle.net/gs42472c/
[14:49:20] <robertmaxrees> $(this).text('some new text');
[14:49:23] <MarioD> I tried this.text(); but that didn't work, I also tried $(this).text();
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:49:43] <MarioD> robert, that's what I figured, didn't seem to work, maybe I'm doing something else wrong
[14:50:04] <MarioD> nope, no errors, and the console log triggers fine
[14:50:28] <robertmaxrees> what kind of element is client?
[14:51:17] <MarioD> it's actually ZeroClipboard: https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard#simple-example
[14:52:31] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle might be helpful.
[14:52:44] <maestrojed> Some functionality was written using javascript Pseudo selectors (mostly for form elements). These don't work in IE8. IE8 is now being added as a requirement. We are facing either rewriting or finding a "solution" to get pseudo selectors in js for IE8. Any suggestions? We looked at selectivizr but that seems to be CSS only.
[14:53:07] <maestrojed> sorry, specifically jquery pseudo selectors
[14:53:22] <robertmaxrees> maestrojed they should work fine.  what version of jquery are you using?
[14:53:35] <MarioD> so it seems like event.target targets the element I need, how can I do .text(""); on event.target ?
[14:53:48] <robertmaxrees> $(event.target).text("");, MarioD
[14:54:25] <MarioD> Worked like a charm, thanks Robert! Learned something new :D
[14:54:29] <maestrojed> robertmaxrees checking
[14:57:16] <maestrojed> robertmaxrees I am working with a coworker on this. Its way old. I appreciate the tip. I have asked them to update that and try again.
[14:57:27] <maestrojed> We will see :)
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> make sure you do the 1.x series.
[14:57:33] <robertmaxrees> not the 2.x series.
[14:57:36] <maestrojed> oh okay
[14:57:41] <maestrojed> thx, looks like 1.4.4
[14:57:43] <maestrojed> currently'
[14:57:54] <robertmaxrees> they're lockstepped in features.  and 1.4.4 should work - what selectors won't work for you?
[14:58:18] <maestrojed> robertmaxrees i have to ask. Let me see what details I can get.
[15:41:44] <doug64k> maestrojed: what pseudo selector(s)?
[15:42:11] <maestrojed> doug64k thx, at this point I am not sure whats going on. I need to investigate further.
[15:42:20] <doug64k> most can be emulated "manually", like $('div:first') -> $('div').first()
[15:42:29] <doug64k> or using .filter for :selected
[15:42:30] <doug64k> etc
[15:42:49] <doug64k> maestrojed: but yeah, upgrade if possible
[15:45:57] <maestrojed> doug64k that is an awesome tip. I saw some of those. thx!
[15:46:58] <__joshua__> yeah, definitately upgrade
[16:50:09] <bm505> I am using jquery to create the text value of a <div> like so:  var myDiv = $('<div>'); myDiv.text = variable a + link + variable b;  I am having trouble inserting the link the the location I describe.  So far I have created a jquery link object like so: $('<a>', {href:...., text: ....});  The problem is I don't know how to add this link as part of myDiv's text
[16:50:39] <bm505> can anyone offer some advice?
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> first off, you want myDiv.text() since you're on a jquery object.
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> if you want to insert a link, though, you want .html() instead.
[16:51:35] <bm505> robertmaxrees: right, I"m using myDiv.text(var a + link + var b)
[16:51:51] <robertmaxrees> change that to .html() and see if that doesn't work.
[16:52:43] <bm505> robertmaxrees: i'm not sure I understand.  how am i using .html()?
[16:53:06] <robertmaxrees> you're not - swap your .text() for .html()
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> literally myDiv.html(var a + link + var b)
[16:54:10] <robertmaxrees> though you'd want to make the link just a string instead if you're going to concat things.
[16:54:34] <bm505> robertmaxrees: well the problem is that the link is going to be created dynamically
[16:54:53] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with a string instead.  otherwise you need to .append() content.
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a7wnww5n/
[16:56:33] <robertmaxrees> for the string version.
[16:57:53] <bm505> robertmaxrees: ok that sort of does what I need but how would I add text to either side of that link
[16:58:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a7wnww5n/1/
[16:58:54] <bm505> robertmaxrees: ok let me try
[17:09:25] <bm505> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a7wnww5n/1/
[17:10:04] <bm505> robertmaxrees: in the code I modified, how can I get the variable 'linkText' value to be displayed?
[17:12:01] <robertmaxrees> did you mean to update that fiddle with something else?
[17:12:32] <robertmaxrees> (i don't see that variable anywhere - make sure you hit "update" and send the link on over)
[17:19:53] <bm505> robertmaxrees: never, mind.  I realized my mistake.  Thank you robertmaxrees
[17:20:02] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:22:04] <bm505> robertmaxrees: I guess I have some misunderstanding between .append() and .text().  Can you tell me when you would use one over the other
[17:22:26] <robertmaxrees> .text() is used when you want to set the text of a node.  .append() is when you want to append content to a node.
[17:22:49] <robertmaxrees> .html() could also be used in your case, instead.
[17:23:54] <bm505> robertmaxrees: so, if i had some type of html code, I should not use .text(), right?
[17:24:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> .text() is for setting text - not html/.
[17:24:17] <Robdgreat> that sounds reasonable :)
[17:24:27] <bm505> robertmaxrees: i see. yes, it does now that I look at it
[17:24:35] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:25:10] <bm505> robertmaxrees: and so then how is .html() different from .append().  They both accept html code as paramters, right?
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> check the docs :)
[17:25:26] <bm505> robertmaxrees: :)
[17:25:58] <robertmaxrees> .html() will set the html of a node, meaning it'll replace anything already there.  .append() simply appends to the node's children, so it doesn't replace anything.
[17:27:37] <bm505> robertmaxrees:
[17:27:42] <bm505> robertmaxrees: gotcha, ok thank you
[17:57:27] <aphadke> got a quick question on jquery.. i have AJAX call that logs in a user and then redirects via window.location = "http://test/login-success.html"
[17:57:41] <aphadke> how do i pass the json body of the ajax response to window.location?
[17:57:56] <robertmaxrees> what does your current code look like?
[17:58:20] <aphadke> robertmaxrees: http://aphadke.pastebin.mozilla.org/6832547
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at it with that console.log()
[17:59:02] <aphadke> robertmaxrees: yes. just to debug..
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href = data;
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> that's how you'd do it.
[17:59:32] <aphadke> data = {"login": "success"}
[17:59:45] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to pass to the URL, then?
[17:59:51] <aphadke> thats what i want to pass as JSON body to window.location.href
[18:00:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid URL...
[18:01:00] <aphadke> URL = https://mysite.com/
[18:01:12] <aphadke> data = {"login": "success"}
[18:01:18] <robertmaxrees> where's the URL coming from?
[18:01:34] <aphadke> i want to pass {"login": "success"} as JSON to mysite.com
[18:01:43] <aphadke> its coming from our internal system, oldsite.com/
[18:01:47] <robertmaxrees> then you have to post it.
[18:01:59] <robertmaxrees> using a form, query string params, or ajax.
[18:02:10] <aphadke> ok. lemme try query string
[18:02:30] <robertmaxrees> append it on the end as ?login=success
[18:02:35] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to parse it.
[18:04:48] <aphadke> gotcha.. that should work
[18:39:06] <hwamokp66> can anyone tell me where these icons are from? http://www.themenesia.com/themeforest/cubic-onepage/homepage-video.html    I want to swap them with different ones but I don't know which ones are avaialable!
[18:46:32] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: Look at the font family in dev tools.
[18:47:19] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: it says "'et-line'"
[18:48:17] <BillCriswell> I bet there's some place on the internet you can type that in and get something useful.
[18:48:28] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: haha okay ill google it
[18:48:57] <BillCriswell> :)
[20:02:26] <wa5ted> grafi: yo
[20:10:15] <AndChat440561> I'm trying to understand jquery ui's draft
[20:12:49] <AndChat440561> I'm trying to understand jquery ui's draggable. Does it reposition elements within the HTML of the page itself? If I drag one element before another, will jquery see it as the first element?
[20:24:32] <dmsuperman> AndChat440561: open up your javascript console and inspect the DOM and try :)
[20:42:43] <AndChat440561> Dmsuperman I can't - I'm out right now :-)
[20:51:08] <fatmandown> Hey guys, I have a problem using .one with animationend
[20:51:18] <fatmandown> I have all of the vendor prefixes, but it's firing four times
[20:51:29] <fatmandown> can I use bind with these
[20:58:10] <doug64k> does anyone see why this doesn't show the rows when you scroll back to the top? http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/12/
[21:00:21] <doug64k> fatmandown: .one can't fire 4 times unless there are 4 .one calls :)
[21:01:44] <dmsuperman> AndChat440561: alright, well good luck! come back to us when you're ready to try things out for yourself and see ;)
[21:02:53] <AndChat440561> you're very helpful. Thanks for the encouragement.
[21:03:57] <doug64k> AndChat440561: jqui makes an object called a "helper" that you actually drag afaik
[21:05:13] <doug64k> jqui tries not to reveal everything, else their whole implementation is a public api and you can't change it
[21:05:30] <doug64k> why does it matter exactly what happens?
[21:07:01] <AndChat440561> Doug64k, because I'll be creating an array according to the visual order. I suppose I can resort to position() if nothing else.
[21:09:33] <dmsuperman> AndChat440561: sounds like you might want sortable
[21:12:41] <dmsuperman> AndChat440561: and use the "update" method to change the position index. in my application, each "sortable" item has a hidden input for the position, and in the update method I do $(listItems).each(function(i, v) { $('input.theSelector', this).val(i); });
[21:19:01] <AndChat440561> dmsuperman, sounds like that will work. Thank you.
[21:23:13] <doug64k> fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/14/   anyone mind testing it a bit for me? it is a table of every unicode character, all 0x110000 of them
[21:24:01] <doug64k> why does it act funny near the end?
[21:24:06] <doug64k> nothing changes size
[21:24:51] <doug64k> click it to focus and hold end
[21:24:56] <doug64k> what's going on??
[21:25:49] <doug64k> AndChat440561: are you using sortable?
[21:26:00] <doug64k> you should be if order matters
[21:26:11] <doug64k> as dmsuperman said
[21:27:15] <AndChat440561> Not yet but I will be.
[21:59:06] <EsoRottica> When binding keypress or keyup with Jquery, does this stop me from selecting text in inputs?
[21:59:43] <doug64k> I fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/16/
[22:00:07] <doug64k> EsoRottica: do you event.preventDefault()?
[22:00:27] <EsoRottica> Not, in the case, no. It would not appear so. doug64k
[22:00:49] <doug64k> then it can't affect selecting text by just processing those events. do you change the value in the event handler?
[22:01:12] <EsoRottica> Nope, Its for a submit generally
[22:01:41] <doug64k> EsoRottica: when people bind keypress and keyup - it is because they don't know they should bind 'input'
[22:01:45] <EsoRottica> I'll have to look further into this one it seems. This page was probably broken before I rouched it doug64k
[22:02:02] <doug64k> 'input' fires at every interactive change
[22:02:23] <doug64k> ok
[22:02:30] <EsoRottica> doug64k: I'll recify that as well.
[22:12:14] <EsoRottica> doug64k: Thanks for the suggestions, Turns out the bug I was hunting down was CSS related... ::selection {background:transparent;}
[22:12:33] <EsoRottica> Why would anyone ever do that!
[22:13:17] <doug64k> wow
[22:26:12] <doug64k> really fixed now, now weirdness at the end http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/18/
[22:27:10] <Kartagis> doug64k: can I ask you a favour?
[22:27:20] <doug64k> not bad performance for showing a "table" of 1114112 characters :)
[22:27:26] <doug64k> Kartagis: sure
[22:27:56] <doug64k> no weirdness I meant
[22:28:21] <ceterizine|work> is anyone familiar with mongoose in here >_>
[22:29:09] <Kartagis> doug64k: can you go to http://seyonrentacar.p2ptechsolutions.com/node/add/booking , turn the status to closed, fill out the dates allotted from and to fields and tell me why number of days field is not filled it the duration?
[22:29:33] <Kartagis> doug64k: it's a specific request, sorry
[22:30:10] <Kartagis> I can do it in the console, but not on the page
[22:30:35] <Kartagis> I tried for several hours yesterday
[22:31:41] <doug64k> Kartagis: sure
[22:33:20] <Kartagis> wow
[22:33:23] <Kartagis> it seems to have worked this time
[22:33:50] <Kartagis> I loaded both javascripts at the same time with foreach
[22:34:33] <Kartagis> no, I spoke too soon
[22:36:01] <doug64k> you what?
[22:36:20] <doug64k> dude why is there 5M lines of code worth of stuff loading?
[22:36:41] <doug64k> I cant even find your code in there
[22:38:11] <Kartagis> line 67
[22:38:21] <doug64k> ceterizine|work: depends on how hard the question is
[22:38:32] <Kartagis> please refresh, I replaced it
[22:39:37] <doug64k>  numberOfDays.val(eDate.diff(sDate, 'days')); ?
[22:40:00] <Kartagis> yeah
[22:40:03] <ceterizine|work> Well, I've got a basic MEAN app going here, using mongoose. I've got a ui-sortable, and $scope.$watch of my model. When you rearrange the list, it succesfully sends the updated model to the server side that I subsequently log out to make sure it matches
[22:40:26] <ceterizine|work> and all that is fine and dandy, but I'm stuck with trying to get it to update the model in the DB so it persists beyond page refresh
[22:40:27] <Kartagis> it works in the console
[22:41:12] <ceterizine|work> I'm having a very difficult time finding relevant documentation
[22:41:29] <doug64k> Kartagis: what version of jq?
[22:41:40] <Kartagis> doug64k: 1.5.2
[22:42:21] <doug64k> Kartagis: the event doesnt even fire for me
[22:42:25] <doug64k> that's the problem?
[22:42:32] <ceterizine|work> Basically my questions are around .update
[22:42:33] <Kartagis> doug64k: yeah
[22:45:08] <doug64k> Kartagis: what plugin is making up and down go by 15 minute intervals?
[22:45:46] <doug64k> ceterizine|work: you say it posts it to the server just fine. how sure are you of that?
[22:46:07] <Kartagis> doug64k: that's a Drupal module called date
[22:46:08] <doug64k> ceterizine|work: saw the post and response in network pane of debugger?
[22:46:15] <ceterizine|work> From the network tab, and console.log(req) in the server side JS
[22:46:20] <Kartagis> I don't know what plugin though
[22:46:39] <ceterizine|work> req.body rather
[22:46:49] <doug64k> Kartagis: line 51, make that say $('input').bind('input change', ...
[22:46:51] <Kartagis> jquery.timeentry
[22:47:05] <doug64k> Kartagis: taking wild guess that their plugin would fire change
[22:47:50] <ceterizine|work> So far, everything I have found is all about updating a particular item
[22:48:05] <ceterizine|work> Where as I'm trying to dump the entire document and replace it with a new one
[22:48:49] <Kartagis> $("input").bind("input", function () { <--- this?
[22:48:54] <doug64k> Kartagis: yes
[22:51:32] <doug64k> omg, reading the drupal docs... seriously?
[22:51:46] <Kartagis> what?
[22:51:54] <doug64k> pages and pages of nothing but text and no docs
[22:52:39] <Kartagis> doug64k: it works with the initial values, but not again
[22:55:10] <dmsuperman> !ask ceterizine|work
[22:55:20] <dmsuperman> oh, sorry. I was scrolled up
[22:55:49] <doug64k> Kartagis: well, if you can decipher the drupal docs, I suggest finding out the names of the events that that plugin emits when you change the date
[22:56:05] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: provide some relevant code examples please
[22:56:08] <doug64k> then just put the name(s) space separated there
[22:56:34] <ceterizine|work> sorry, backend: http://pastebin.com/x6wda10w frontend: http://pastebin.com/1QP8EDf2
[22:57:17] <dmsuperman> I don't see where you're trying to update anything
[22:57:37] <ceterizine|work> That's because I'm confused on how to do that part.
[22:57:49] <ceterizine|work> I've got it sending the data I need to update with, but that's where Im hitting a wall
[22:58:01] <dmsuperman> what are you stuck on?
[22:58:13] <doug64k> he's creating it through the mongoose model
[22:58:25] <dmsuperman> mongoose provides an update method
[22:58:27] <dmsuperman> http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/updating-documents.html
[22:59:21] <dmsuperman> you can use {$set: theDocument} to just update the entire document if that's what your after (though that's not ideal)
[22:59:43] <dmsuperman> just make sure to use the id in the conditions object to select the relevant document to update
[22:59:54] <doug64k> ceterizine|work: "messin around?"
[22:59:59] <ceterizine|work> >_>
[23:00:27] <doug64k> just brute force hack attempt I guess
[23:00:28] <doug64k> ?
[23:00:50] <ceterizine|work> YEah
[23:01:02] <doug64k> ceterizine|work: put shouldn't create. put updates one right?
[23:01:05] <ceterizine|work> someone mentioned I should loop over the array and do a .create for each one
[23:01:16] <dmsuperman> I don't see why you would use .create to update existing records
[23:01:24] <dmsuperman> unless I'm missing something. Haven't touched mongoose in a while
[23:01:32] <ceterizine|work> Well that's the thing, I'm not changing any data
[23:01:50] <dmsuperman> what are you doing then?
[23:01:58] <ceterizine|work> I'm just reordering the ites
[23:02:00] <doug64k> that's the difference. post is supposed to mean create, and put is supposed to mean update, afaik
[23:02:00] <ceterizine|work> items*
[23:02:13] <dmsuperman> that's changing data
[23:02:23] <dmsuperman> you want to change the order field on multiple documents
[23:03:07] <ceterizine|work> I guess that's what Im trying to do yeah
[23:03:11] <dmsuperman> btw for future reference node questions are better suited for ##javascript. You aren't asking any #jquery-related questions after all ;)
[23:03:44] <Kartagis> https://www.drupal.org/node/1455576 <--- doug64k this page says a jQuery popup calendar is used. other than that, I don't know how to find out what events are supported.
[23:03:44] <ceterizine|work> good point >_>
[23:04:16] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: Anyway, what I would do is in the frontend, get the ID and the new order value for each of the documents, and pass that as an array to the backend
[23:04:33] <dmsuperman> the backend then loops over the IDs and for each ID issues an update command to change the order field to the new order
[23:04:41] <dmsuperman> using the Id for the condition for the update
[23:04:58] <dmsuperman> I wouldn't pass the entire document for updating if you're only changing one field
[23:04:59] <doug64k> Kartagis: this? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[23:05:05] <Kartagis> doug64k: yeah
[23:06:07] <doug64k> Kartagis: omg, the docs say this: This widget manipulates its element's value programmatically, therefore a native change event may not be fired when the element's value changes.
[23:06:21] <Kartagis> uhm
[23:06:27] <Kartagis> what do we do?
[23:07:41] <doug64k> poll? and when it changes, .trigger('change') ?
[23:07:57] <doug64k> add a comment grumbling about query ui? :)
[23:07:58] <dmsuperman> doug64k: ew :P
[23:08:12] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: any possibility of using an alternate datepicker that doesn't suck?
[23:08:14] <doug64k> no, you could try keypress I guess
[23:08:17] <doug64k> or keydown
[23:08:23] <dmsuperman> I doubt it would fire keypress if it doesn't fire input
[23:08:41] <doug64k> dmsuperman: yeah but the changes are by keyboard
[23:08:58] <doug64k> dmsuperman: hopefully jqui doesn't block you that badly
[23:09:12] <dmsuperman> I'm late to the party but it sounds like you want to detect when the selected date from the date picker changes?
[23:09:28] <dmsuperman> ie when the input value changes
[23:10:00] <doug64k> it's Kartagis problem: http://seyonrentacar.p2ptechsolutions.com/node/add/booking
[23:10:10] <doug64k> keypresses in the time field dont fire an event
[23:10:23] <doug64k> dont fire input or change
[23:10:36] <Kartagis> doug64k: I don't care about time field right now
[23:10:47] <Kartagis> I care about date fields
[23:11:28] <dmsuperman> can you re-explain the issue for me Kartagis?
[23:11:57] <doug64k> Kartagis: same issue
[23:12:29] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: I'm trying to update a .val(), but doesn't work
[23:12:49] <doug64k> Kartagis: no
[23:12:55] <doug64k> it doesnt even run the event handler
[23:13:01] <doug64k> forget the event handler code for now!
[23:13:06] <Kartagis> okay
[23:13:19] <dmsuperman> when I bind to the change event and I change the value of the time field, it fires the event for me
[23:13:40] <dmsuperman> change the value by hand with my keyboard, that is
[23:13:44] <doug64k> Kartagis: did you bind 'input change' ?
[23:14:06] <dmsuperman> your jquery is out of date, by the way. there's no jquery.on and that makes for a sad dmsuperman
[23:14:34] <dmsuperman> could be part of the issue?
[23:14:37] <Kartagis> I did, I'm trying something else now
[23:14:39] <doug64k> dmsuperman: it's drupal
[23:14:45] <dmsuperman> shame
[23:15:01] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: so what exactly is the problem you're trying to solve
[23:15:15] <doug64k> dmsuperman: it never reaches line 48
[23:15:19] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: when I update it, fieldset expands doesn't work
[23:15:31] <dmsuperman> when you update *what*
[23:15:38] <dmsuperman> and how
[23:15:51] <dmsuperman> and "fieldset expands doesn't work"??? what does that mean
[23:16:06] <dmsuperman> doug64k: that's not an X, that's a Y. I want the X ;)
[23:17:38] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: when I enable jquery_update, I can update the jquery, but this time collapsible fieldset aren't expandable now, hence jquery conflict
[23:18:06] <dmsuperman> I have almost no idea what you're talking about
[23:18:17] <dmsuperman> :)
[23:18:28] <Kartagis> one sec, allow me to demonstrate
[23:18:37] <Kartagis> allow me, dammit!
[23:18:40] <Kartagis> :P
[23:18:46] <Kartagis> sorry, had to do it
[23:18:51] <doug64k> Kartagis: you want a fix? when you want it to update, click in the time field and press any letter
[23:19:21] <doug64k> not any key, any LETTER
[23:19:39] <dmsuperman> maybe you can help explain what the problem is doug64k
[23:19:52] <doug64k> dmsuperman: he is trying to get an event when they change the date
[23:20:01] <doug64k> it's a jquery ui calendar thing
[23:20:11] <dmsuperman> the date, or the time?
[23:20:19] <doug64k> my mind blew when I read the doc and there are no events
[23:20:24] <doug64k> date
[23:20:50] <dmsuperman> ok well again, I get change events just fine
[23:20:57] <doug64k> if you have that page open, see line 48 of node/add/booking
[23:21:35] <dmsuperman> http://i.imgur.com/qlVPag9.png
[23:21:35] <doug64k> dmsuperman: I suggested using 'input change keypress' a while ago
[23:21:54] <dmsuperman> I get the alert as soon as I pick a date
[23:22:12] <doug64k> he added keypress and not change :(
[23:22:21] <doug64k> Kartagis: you there?
[23:22:34] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: that's because closing km is less than opening
[23:22:44] <Kartagis> doug64k: of course
[23:22:45] <dmsuperman> ...
[23:22:58] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: did you get my suggestion?
[23:23:08] <doug64k> Kartagis: add 'change' there where you only added keypress. dmsuperman verified he gets change events
[23:23:20] <doug64k> that's the first thing I suggested btw
[23:24:00] <Kartagis> doug64k: I had added it
[23:24:16] <Kartagis> $("input").bind("input change", function () { right
[23:24:40] <ceterizine|work> Sorry
[23:24:43] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: so what is the issue then? you clearly get the events to fire
[23:24:54] <doug64k> dmsuperman: pick closed in that dropdown and scroll down
[23:24:59] <doug64k> now the event fires
[23:25:01] <ceterizine|work> dmsuperman: Actually that's a good idea
[23:25:16] <dmsuperman> doug64k: pick closed? what does that mean
[23:25:20] <ceterizine|work> Kind of goes against the direction of not storing organizational data in the DB
[23:25:22] <doug64k> dmsuperman: after making an event fire. the combobox
[23:25:27] <ceterizine|work> but whatver
[23:25:31] <doug64k> status
[23:26:01] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: Well ideally you wouldn't have an explicit ordering, it would be some kind of algorithm like "sort by name ascending"
[23:26:16] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: but obviously there are exceptions. DB normative rules are meant to be broken >:)
[23:26:27] <dmsuperman> doug64k: I don't follow
[23:26:33] <doug64k> Kartagis: it might be easier to work on if that thing at the bottom weren't so sloppy
[23:26:46] <dmsuperman> can you rephrase what you're saying doug64k
[23:26:55] <Kartagis> doug64k: what "thing"?
[23:26:58] <doug64k> dmsuperman: on that form he's debugging, pick "closed" in the status, then make a change event fire
[23:27:02] <ceterizine|work> but it'll work, I can loop over the entire array, and for each _id update sortOrder with var i
[23:27:10] <doug64k> ...on an input
[23:27:19] <dmsuperman> ok... works fine
[23:27:24] <dmsuperman> what are you demonstrating
[23:27:32] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: yup :)
[23:27:40] <doug64k> dmsuperman: you scrolled down and saw all that stuff he's setting values on?
[23:27:53] <ceterizine|work> cool, only took 2 weeks to figure that out -_-
[23:28:04] <dmsuperman> scrolled down to what doug64k
[23:28:13] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: we all start somewhere
[23:28:40] <doug64k> dmsuperman: I give up. good luck Kartagis
[23:28:42] <ceterizine|work> I'm shooting for the engineering team at my job, so I've been spending just about every night on a new challenge
[23:28:48] * dmsuperman shrugs
[23:28:59] * Kartagis pouts
[23:29:02] <dmsuperman> I'm not really sure why, you're the one making vague and confusing statements
[23:29:03] <dmsuperman> well, you both are
[23:29:11] <dmsuperman> I still don't have the faintest idea what the problem you're trying to solve is
[23:29:20] <Kartagis> doug64k: it works only for initial values
[23:29:36] <doug64k> dmsuperman: I typed out repro instructions and you pretended to be following them
[23:30:03] <dmsuperman> well you gave a vague singular instruction that I followed
[23:30:09] <dmsuperman> but had no clue what point you were trying to make with it
[23:30:27] <doug64k> he's trying to calculate stuff when the form inputs change... sort of obvious. did you bother to look at the source dmsuperman ?
[23:30:41] <dmsuperman> what source? the HTML source?
[23:30:45] <dmsuperman> there's like 827365 javascript files
[23:31:00] <doug64k> I told you, it's in node/add/booking
[23:31:06] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: on that page, you have two date fields; dates allotted from and to. I calculate the days in between, that's done; but I'm getting no luck setting the .val()
[23:31:07] <doug64k> I know, it's a sea of drupal libraries
[23:31:13] <dmsuperman> right, which references like 82745 javascripts libraries
[23:31:16] <dmsuperman> how is that in any way obvious?
[23:31:33] <doug64k> sorry I thought you noticed
[23:31:35] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: again, setting the .val of *what*?
[23:32:34] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: number of days textfield
[23:32:36] <doug64k> dmsuperman: those vague instructions were to show you "what". scroll down
[23:32:55] <doug64k> and if there's nothing there you didnt pick Closed
[23:32:57] <dmsuperman> "scroll down" in no way tells me what I'm supposed to be looking at
[23:32:58] <doug64k> Kartagis: right?
[23:33:37] <dmsuperman> where's the relevant code?
[23:33:38] <doug64k> dmsuperman: LOTS of inputs
[23:33:43] * dmsuperman facepalms
[23:33:44] <Kartagis> doug64k: I've changed it to input change, and it only works for the initial values
[23:33:48] <doug64k> pick status closed ffs
[23:33:54] <dmsuperman> maybe you should give up doug64k you're really only confusing the issue more
[23:33:55] <doug64k> then scroll down :D
[23:33:57] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: line #48
[23:34:15] <Kartagis> doug64k: please don't
[23:34:19] <dmsuperman> line #48 of what?
[23:34:30] <doug64k> dmsuperman: no, you are just trying to make it a joke where we're all babbling idiots
[23:34:33] <dmsuperman> node/add/booking line #48 is just a javascript library include
[23:34:33] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: yuvaraj.js
[23:34:38] <dmsuperman> thereeee we go
[23:34:38] <doug64k> well haha I'm lmao
[23:34:54] <dmsuperman> you are being ridiculously vague and now combative
[23:34:56] <dmsuperman> I'm not making any jokes
[23:35:13] <dmsuperman> let me look at yuvaraj.js
[23:35:30] <dmsuperman> (this is the first time anybody has even mentioned which JS file I'm meant to be looking at btw)
[23:35:42] <doug64k> dmsuperman: a long time ago I told you over and over, pick status closed
[23:35:55] <doug64k> did you do that?
[23:35:57] <dmsuperman> I did. I picked it the moment you told me to do that
[23:36:01] <dmsuperman> I saw that it dropped down more fields
[23:36:07] <dmsuperman> that still didn't make it obvious what I was looking for
[23:36:09] <doug64k> ok now there are a lot of fields down firther on the page
[23:36:16] <dmsuperman> btw line 48 is a parseInt line
[23:36:19] <dmsuperman> are you sure you mean line 48
[23:36:45] <doug64k> var vTotalKm = parseInt(closingKm.val() || 0, 10) - parseInt(openingKm.val() || 0, 10),
[23:36:46] <dmsuperman> nvm I see the context
[23:37:28] <doug64k> he sets them with .val
[23:37:47] <Kartagis> doug64k: which I can
[23:37:53] <doug64k> Kartagis: don't what'
[23:38:25] <dmsuperman> I see him setting totalCharges there. nothing about the dates though
[23:38:30] <dmsuperman> where did the date picker come into this
[23:38:47] <Kartagis> 14
[23:38:56] <Kartagis> line #14
[23:39:16] <dmsuperman> I see line #14, I don't see the relevance
[23:39:20] <dmsuperman> to the totalCharges variable
[23:39:22] <doug64k> Kartagis: don't try to help? ok, np
[23:39:34] <Kartagis> okay, sorry
[23:39:42] <dmsuperman> doug64k quit being a petulant child
[23:39:51] <dmsuperman> he was saying don't leave
[23:40:06] <dmsuperman> help, or don't, but don't sit here arguing and derailing the convo
[23:40:28] <Kartagis> doug64k: that's right, I was saying "please don't give up"
[23:40:34] <doug64k> dmsuperman: dude, I spent considerable effort trying to bring you up to speed - since you were having difficulty getting details
[23:40:56] <dmsuperman> you gave extremely vague responses and got angry when I didn't divine the other half of the information from your brain
[23:41:07] <doug64k> and to do that you needed to get a repro going to look at it
[23:41:21] <doug64k> Kartagis: ok now that you are getting lots of events, what is wrong now?
[23:41:37] <doug64k> sorry I got pissy
[23:42:30] <Kartagis> doug64k, dmsuperman: the problem is I can't set the .val() or the number of days textfield with the days in between dates allotted to and from fields
[23:42:36] <doug64k> numberOfDays doesn't set?
[23:42:40] <Kartagis> yes
[23:43:00] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: I see
[23:43:05] <dmsuperman> openingDate isn't a reference to an input
[23:43:08] <dmsuperman> it's a string
[23:43:11] <dmsuperman> look at line 14
[23:43:12] <Kartagis> I mean no it doesn't
[23:43:38] <dmsuperman> you're not setting openingDate to a jquery object, you're setting it to the value of jqueryObj.val()
[23:43:41] <dmsuperman> which returns a string
[23:43:56] <Kartagis> 10/21/2014
[23:44:01] <Kartagis> I get this
[23:44:03] <dmsuperman> whatever it is, it's a string
[23:44:11] <dmsuperman> you can't call "string".bind('blur'...
[23:44:28] <doug64k> Kartagis: works for me
[23:44:32] <dmsuperman> I think you want to remove the .val() bits from line 14 and 18
[23:44:37] <dmsuperman> just a thought tho
[23:44:46] <Kartagis> doug64k: only for the initial dates
[23:45:14] <doug64k> Kartagis: how do I make it not work then?
[23:45:37] <Kartagis> doug64k: pick other dates
[23:46:38] <doug64k> Kartagis: you never update sDate
[23:46:46] <dmsuperman> no no no, you're getting ahead of yourself
[23:46:52] <doug64k> recalculate sDate
[23:47:00] <dmsuperman> address the openingDate variable issue on line 14 first
[23:47:04] <dmsuperman> and same with closingDate on line 18
[23:47:10] <dmsuperman> you are trying to use a string as a jquery object
[23:47:18] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: removed .val()
[23:47:29] <doug64k> dmsuperman: it would crash wouldnt it??
[23:47:41] <dmsuperman> hard to say
[23:48:02] <Kartagis> doug64k: that sDate etc comes from moment.js stuff, let me update it with jquery stuff
[23:48:05] <doug64k> dmsuperman: now he's passing a jquery object to the date constructor
[23:48:08] <doug64k> right?
[23:48:09] <dmsuperman> alright, upon refreshing the page, when I change the date fields, I get NaN in the "number of days" field
[23:48:19] <dmsuperman> yep
[23:48:29] <dmsuperman> oh wait well... that line is commented out
[23:49:09] <dmsuperman> but yes when uncommented it would be incorrect. you would want
[23:49:16] <dmsuperman> new Date(closingDate.val())
[23:49:22] <dmsuperman> and new Date(openingDate.val())
[23:49:36] <dmsuperman> since we removed .val() from the variable declarations above
[23:49:43] <doug64k> Kartagis: you don't expect sDate to change by itself do you?
[23:50:13] <doug64k> it gets set once and never updated
[23:50:56] <Kartagis> doug64k: forget sDate and other stuff please, I did those for moment.js
[23:51:07] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: what's the issue then?
[23:51:13] <dmsuperman> you're changing too much
[23:51:14] <doug64k> Kartagis: buddy, where do you think it gets the number of days from
[23:51:40] <doug64k> numberOfDays.val(eDate.diff(sDate, 'days'));
[23:51:51] <doug64k> lol
[23:52:05] <Kartagis> doug64k: var dateDiff = (parseInt(new Date(closingDate)) - parseInt(new Date(openingDate)))/1000/3600/24;numberOfDays.val(dateDiff);
[23:52:06] <dmsuperman> your dateDiff line is just plain wrong
[23:52:12] <dmsuperman> parseInt(new Date()) returns NaN
[23:52:38] <Kartagis> I should do new  Date().val() ?
[23:52:39] <doug64k> you can call datediff all day and compute the cure for cancer and that won't change the line that wont change the number of days
[23:52:44] <dmsuperman> no no no no
[23:52:49] <dmsuperman> javascript is nice to you though
[23:52:55] <dmsuperman> you can subtract dates, I believe
[23:53:04] <doug64k> update datediff*
[23:53:25] <dmsuperman> numberOfDays.val(newValue) should work fine doug64k I don't think that's the issue
[23:53:32] <doug64k> Kartagis: did you come here to convince me that it's all correct already?
[23:53:34] <dmsuperman> and in my case it correct sets the value of the input to NaN
[23:53:40] <dmsuperman> calm yourself ;)
[23:53:59] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: your problem is that the dateDiff line is what's wrong here. that's not how you find the number of days between two dates
[23:54:02] <doug64k> I stepped through the code and I have the solution. now I have to argue and convince Kartagis that that is what it is? forget it
[23:54:10] <Kartagis> doug64k: no I haven't
[23:54:20] <doug64k> update sDate to make number of days change
[23:54:41] <Kartagis> doug64k: please refresh, I stopped using that
[23:54:53] <dmsuperman> indeed doug64k
[23:54:58] <dmsuperman> calm yourself, take a breath
[23:54:59] <dmsuperman> refresh
[23:55:05] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: here's what you want
[23:55:12] <Uhkis> what on earth are you guys trying to achieve
[23:55:30] <dmsuperman> we're keeping Kartagis employed
[23:55:31] <dmsuperman> apparently
[23:55:38] <Kartagis> lol
[23:55:46] <dmsuperman> anyway Kartagis
[23:55:59] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: I'm all eyes
[23:56:00] <dmsuperman> if you just subtract two date objects, no parseInt, none of that, you get then umber of milliseconds between the two
[23:56:23] <dmsuperman> so:  new Date(closingDate.val()) - new Date(openingDate.val())
[23:56:28] <Uhkis> dmsuperman: lol
[23:56:28] <dmsuperman> that gives you number of milliseconds between the dates
[23:57:00] <dmsuperman> then divide by 1000, divide by 60, divide by 60, divide by 24...and I think that's it
[23:57:25] <dmsuperman> var dateDiff = ( new Date(closingDate.val()) - new Date(openingDate.val()) ) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24;
[23:57:55] <Kartagis> new Date(closingTime.val()) - new Date(openingDate.val()) gave me NaN
[23:58:04] <dmsuperman> closingDate
[23:58:09] <dmsuperman> why would you use closingTime
[23:58:12] <Kartagis> oh sorry
[23:58:18] <Kartagis> got confused
[23:59:20] <Kartagis> (new Date(closingDate.val()) - new Date(openingDate.val()))/1000/60/60/24
[23:59:31] <dmsuperman> yup
[23:59:42] <Uhkis> something to do with this? http://seyonrentacar.p2ptechsolutions.com/node/add/booking
[23:59:55] <sacho_> why arent you just using an actual date lib
