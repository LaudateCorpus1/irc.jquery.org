[00:21:23] <wildpod> hi, I can't call jquery functions like $.ajax it shows an error in the console, does anyone nows why?
[00:21:44] <wildpod> *knows
[00:23:59] <Cork> wildpod: you prob haven't loaded the jquery lib
[00:24:33] <wildpod> I include jquery from google
[00:24:51] <wildpod> for example $(window) works fine
[00:24:51] <Cork> is it loaded before you try to use it?
[00:25:06] <Cork> sounds like you might load some other lib that uses $
[00:25:09] <Cork> try jQuery()
[00:25:29] <wildpod> jquery is the only external library I load
[00:25:42] <Cork> link?
[00:43:20] <drager> How come this code takes time to perform the first time the page is loaded? $errorEl.slideDown('fast').html("<p>Something went wrong! Please wait and try again later.</p>");
[00:43:35] <drager> Second time (without refresh) it goes fast
[00:50:30] <[E]sc> i'm using jqueryui 1.10.4, i previously had a customized closed dialog button for the modal dialog.  When i bring the dialog forward, the button doesn't fully show, previously it was offset, how can i fix this? it disappears if it's "outside" the dialog box
[00:53:15] <Cork> [E]sc: sounds like you hit overflow
[00:53:16] <Cork> just check the css
[00:54:47] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks.  i've overflow is set to visible though and it still doesn't show properly
[00:55:17] <Cork> [E]sc: the overflow is on one of its parents
[00:55:30] <Cork> but ya if you need help make a fiddle
[00:56:42] <[E]sc> Cork...thanks!! that fixed it!! it was the parent's overflow.
[01:08:21] <drager> How come this code takes time to perform the first time the page is loaded? $errorEl.slideDown('fast').html("<p>Something went wrong! Please wait and try again later.</p>");
[01:08:24] <drager> Second time (without refresh) it goes fast
[01:08:49] <drager> Is it because I have display none on that element?
[01:08:51] <drager> On load?
[01:09:00] <Cork> drager: cause $erroEl is already visible?
[01:09:23] <Cork> slideDown only slides down the element if it isn't already visible
[01:09:33] <drager> Cork: But I have display: none?
[01:09:37] <drager> In the css
[01:09:38] <drager> on that el
[01:09:47] <Cork> that is invidible ya
[01:09:59] <drager> so?=
[01:10:02] <drager> It should work fine=
[01:10:11] <Woet> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/Yh2sq/ - it's instant
[01:10:29] <Woet> so, please provide a demo or replicate the problem on jsfiddle.
[01:10:38] <Cork> slideDown/slideUp/slideToggle/show/hide/fadeIn/fadeOut/fadeToggle builds what they do based on the display == none or not
[01:10:51] <Cork> drager: ^
[01:12:04] <drager> Alright
[01:13:01] <Uhkis> ohai Woet :-)
[01:13:07] <Woet> hello Uhkis
[01:14:11] <drager> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/Yh2sq/1/
[01:15:57] <mepl> Shouldn't arr.join(';'); join my arr = [1,0,3] into arr = '1,0,3'?
[01:16:06] <Cork> drager: isn't that what is expected to happen?
[01:16:09] <mepl> '1;0;3' *
[01:16:50] <Cork> js> var arr = [1,0,3]; print(arr.join(';'))
[01:16:56] <b-ot> Cork: 1;0;3
[01:17:02] <Cork> i would say yes :)
[01:17:35] <mepl> lol
[01:17:38] <drager> Cork: No?
[01:17:39] <mepl> my printer started now
[01:18:00] <Cork> drager: what are you expecting to happen?
[01:19:24] <drager> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Yh2sq/2/
[01:19:29] <drager> Bring it down then up
[01:19:32] <drager> then down again
[01:19:36] <drager> second time it's right
[01:22:15] <drager> ah, it's because of the text...
[01:22:55] <drager> Cork: This works fine; http://jsfiddle.net/Yh2sq/3/
[01:23:01] <drager> When I provided a height to the div
[01:23:03] <raj> Cork, can I ask you a general question?
[01:23:34] <Cork> drager: note that display: none is bad to use for animation
[01:23:42] <Cork> drager: and that is most likely why you get problem
[01:24:03] <Cork> drager: if you set display: none; you can't set that you want display: block (to be able to hold the p element)
[01:24:33] <Cork> as jquery don't know this it uses display: inline
[01:24:35] <Cork> and that fails for you
[01:25:32] <Cork> drager: so instead use display: block in the css, and use .hide() on page load
[01:25:48] <Cork> raj: just ask the question and if someone has an answer they will answer it
[01:25:50] <Cork> (or direct you to where you should ask it :) )
[01:26:24] <drager> Cork: That didnt matter (I tested) but the height did as I said
[01:30:11] <raj> I have a python webapp and I'd like to implement asynchronous stuff (like chat) in node.js. However, all the user information is stored in python, and the user is authenticated in python... how can I give node.js access to the user data so the chatroom can confidently show which user has sent each msg (also which users are in the chatroom)
[01:31:01] <Cork> raj: not sure, never done a cross server between those languages
[01:31:24] <Cork> but if it was another language i would use memcache
[01:31:34] <Cork> and i suspect node.js has that too
[01:31:44] <Cork> though i've never looked
[01:32:15] <drager> raj: I think you need something between python and node
[01:32:38] <Cork> ?g node.js memcache
[01:32:40] <b-ot> Cork: Easy way for accesing memcached from node.js - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6233832/easy-way-for-accesing-memcached-from-node-js
[01:32:51] <Cork> ?g node.js memcache -stackoverflow.com
[01:32:52] <b-ot> Cork: elbart/node-memcache · GitHub → https://github.com/elbart/node-memcache
[01:32:57] <Cork> there you go
[01:34:02] <raj> Cork, is that like using redis
[01:34:03] <raj> ?
[01:35:02] <Uhkis> i think #node.js has more help on this topic
[01:35:03] <Cork> never used it
[01:35:05] <Cork> but possible
[01:35:14] <Cork> and ya, it is off topic here
[01:35:36] <Cork> raj: the point is you need to provide a way to share the session between the servers
[01:36:10] <raj> ok, but node still has to check which user the session is for
[01:36:19] <raj> how is that verified?
[01:36:51] <Cork> raj: how session works is the browser sends an id and you use that id to connect the requests
[01:36:58] <Cork> the user is used to start the session
[01:37:32] <Cork> in the session you then store the data you want between the connections (like what user it belongs to)
[01:38:38] <raj> so the browser needs to send the same id to python and to node
[01:38:38] <raj> ?
[01:38:41] <Cork> uh
[01:38:47] <Cork> you know how http session works right?
[01:38:51] <mepl> I have issues with this piece of code. http://jsfiddle.net/2LFss/ Each time I alert the arr at line 16 it increases. First it is 1,0,3 then it is 1,0,3,1,0,3 and so on. It never resets even thought I set the length to 0.
[01:38:53] <raj> cookies?
[01:39:08] <Cork> yes a session cookie is storing a session id for the domain
[01:39:17] <Cork> and each connection to the domain it sends the session id
[01:39:23] <shoky> and it's usually read by a serverside framework
[01:39:32] <Cork> it is always read server side
[01:39:36] <shoky> like raj is probably using in python
[01:39:39] <Cork> that is the point of session id
[01:39:50] <shoky> so how would his node app know what to do with that session id
[01:39:54] <Cork> the id identifys the session
[01:40:11] <Cork> cause you connect the servers to the memcache for the session store
[01:40:27] <Cork> so the memcache server hods the session database
[01:40:45] <raj> so python stores the id with the user info in memcache, and then node looks up that id to get the info
[01:40:51] <Cork> no
[01:41:00] <Cork> it stores the data on the id in the memcache server
[01:41:08] <Cork> instead of in a local lib in the language
[01:41:12] <raj> ya, that's what I meant
[01:41:33] <Cork> you basically replace the session system
[01:41:35] <shoky> so you'd have to change how you handle sessions in python
[01:41:50] <Cork> well you would have to hook it up with the external server ya
[01:42:20] <Cork> and you would have to make sure both servers writes/reads the same session format
[01:42:24] <BadCodSmell> Has jquery changed to only assign its self to global var on ready?
[01:42:27] <shoky> yeh.
[01:42:34] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no
[01:42:36] <BadCodSmell> Because I updated and now all of my scripts are broken on start up
[01:42:42] <BadCodSmell> As they cannot find $ or jQuery
[01:42:50] <BadCodSmell> But jquery is loaded first and successfully
[01:43:06] <Cork> BadCodSmell: so check step by step what happens in the site
[01:43:46] <Cork> mepl: you should never to arr[i] = value
[01:43:53] <Cork> ALWAYS do arr.push()
[01:44:03] <mepl> ok
[01:44:05] <mepl> ill test it
[01:44:19] <BadCodSmell> The first thing is that jquer 2.1.0 is loaded successfully
[01:44:57] <mepl> Cork: still it never resets it
[01:45:03] <Cork> mepl: http://jsfiddle.net/2LFss/2/
[01:46:47] <mepl> Cork: mep mep?
[01:46:51] <seutje> Cork: bastard, my internets were lagging
[01:46:52] <BadCodSmell> facepalm
[01:46:53] <seutje> mepl: http://jsfiddle.net/2LFss/1/
[01:47:01] <BadCodSmell> Errors coming out of some iframe
[01:47:02] <Cork> mepl: well it was in the fiddle
[01:47:11] <BadCodSmell> So that explains why everything seemed to be working
[01:47:13] <BadCodSmell> Thanks!
[01:47:39] <Cork> seutje: you missed to actually use the joined string :)
[01:47:52] <seutje> yea, just noticed
[01:48:04] <seutje> you didn't even include jQuery or markup!
[01:48:23] <seutje> in my defence, I console.logged, so no need to join :P
[01:48:26] <Cork> well it isn't really working code so...
[01:48:31] <Cork> :)
[01:48:32] <seutje> but yeah, still doing it for no reason
[01:48:41] <mepl> Cork: I copied your code, removed the mep... still it keeps increasing
[01:48:42] <mepl> never resets
[01:48:44] <seutje> I'M SORRY OKAY?
[01:48:52] <Cork> mepl: what is increasing?
[01:48:57] <mepl> joined
[01:49:05] <seutje> mepl: sounds like ur arr is leaking
[01:49:11] <Cork> mepl: then you are adding mroe and more elements to the dom
[01:49:14] <mepl> 1;0;3 -> 1;0;3;1;0;3 -> 1;0;3;1... and so on
[01:49:20] <Cork> seutje: the arr is created in the function
[01:49:23] <seutje> guess that's possible as well
[01:49:44] <xored> Hello. Is there a way to use .on with something like "for all elements you find in the DOM, no matter they get inserted later on (e.g. by ajax)
[01:49:46] <Cork> mepl: console.log($('#cb-table tr').not(':first').length)
[01:49:47] <mepl> found the issue
[01:49:51] <Cork> run that before the each
[01:49:51] <seutje> mepl: would be nice to have an example that actually shows the issue though
[01:49:56] <Cork> ya
[01:50:17] <Cork> xored: sure use the delegate syntax for on
[01:50:22] <Cork> ?api on
[01:50:22] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:52:47] <pingec> how does the .data() function work? How/where are these objects actually stored in the DOM?
[01:54:03] <Cork> pingec: it's stored in an internal object in jquery
[01:54:22] <Cork> and the key is a shim value attached to the dom element
[01:58:17] <Cork> pingec: jquery has an internal guid counter and jQuery.expando
[01:58:20] <Cork> so it does elm[jQuery.expando] = jQuery.guid++
[01:58:23] <Cork> and that number is used as key for the data store
[02:03:50] <pingec> Cork I see, thanks
[02:05:17] <pingec> I see that .data() will also fetch all data-* attributes
[02:05:24] <pingec> That could be handy
[02:05:27] <glontu> hi
[02:05:32] <pingec> hello
[02:05:37] <glontu> i'm trying to show a google map on a slider
[02:05:45] <Cork> pingec: ya, and it also parses those values
[02:06:11] <Cork> (numbers becomes numbers json becomes objects/arrays and so on)
[02:06:22] <glontu> problem is that it dosn't render ... and i think it may be because of the height property stuff. second problem is that i do not have control over the outer html
[02:06:44] <glontu> is there any solution to fix this using js ?
[02:06:54] <Cork> glontu: most likely cause the element has display: none as the map loads
[02:07:07] <Cork> at least that used to be a limitation in it when i last fiddled with it
[02:07:13] <glontu> Cork, i am doing the event trigger refresh stuff
[02:07:26] <glontu> sorry ... iam triggering the resize event
[02:07:50] <glontu> shouldn't that fix it ? also i tried showing the map just outside of the slider and it still won't render
[02:07:57] <glontu> even if the div is fully visible to start with
[02:08:30] <Cork> hmm if it doens't work when it is visible normally it sounds like something else
[02:08:39] <glontu> this is the app if anyone can figure anything out from this : http://liviu.infp.ro
[02:09:08] <glontu> now it's supposed to come up when you click oh the top left second button
[02:10:01] <David_Connelly> Does anyone here has experience of modifying those little date picker calendars?
[02:10:05] <David_Connelly> oops, have
[02:10:10] <xored> Cork: but with delegate i have to use an event Type, i basically want to exceute some b-logic on those elements when they are inserted
[02:10:32] <Cork> xored: oh, no there isn't any cross browser support for that
[02:10:37] <Cork> there is one on the way though
[02:11:07] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[02:11:08] <xored> Cork you mean mutation observer (object)
[02:11:09] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[02:11:12] <Cork> yes
[02:11:21] <Cork> xored: though it isn't ready to be used yet
[02:11:32] <xored> Cork: well, but beside that, there is no xbrowser implementation?
[02:11:47] <Cork> xored: there is no way to get the info from dom
[02:11:53] <xored> its useless for me, since its IE11+ and i have to support IE10+
[02:12:01] <xored> Cork: ok, i see
[02:12:07] <Cork> xored: all other solutions depend on a function telling you when it happens
[02:12:18] <Cork> like hooking into .append or .html
[02:12:19] <xored> Cork:  thak you for the clarifications
[02:12:37] <Cork> that is only based on assumptions
[02:12:57] <Cork> xored: ya, that is why i said it is to early to be used
[02:13:09] <Cork> give it 2-3 years and it should be ready
[02:13:25] <David_Connelly> Folks, I've purchased a template (called Metro) and it has a little calendar on the side bar.  When you click the dates on the little calendar nothing happens.  Can anyone show me how to tweak that so that clicking a particular date will divert to a URL with the date carried as a segment?  I'll be happy to pay for help.
[02:13:33] <Cork> (hopefully ie9 should be dead by then and with a bit of luck newer ie's won't live for as long)
[02:15:05] <bigbugjava> Hi there, I have this long code I wrote, to get users pictures from facebook, and choose them into array, at starts I wanted a checked box, well it's good, but as I use it more often I notice I would rather make the complete td of the table clickable, this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/c6uTJ/ , I dont know what I need to change there to make complete td clickable.
[02:17:07] <adam-lynch> According to the docs, keydown is only triggered once per key press, even if the key is held down, right? And keypress is triggered constantly while the key is held down? Well, I'm seeing keydown being triggered constantly while a key is being pressed. See here http://jsfiddle.net/nTT47/
[02:17:14] <adam-lynch> Anyone got any ideas?
[02:17:46] <adam-lynch> I need to catch when the key is first pressed only, to make sure the key was initially pressed in my tab
[02:17:50] <seutje> adam-lynch: input.setAttribute('AddEventLisener', 'checkbox'); this actually works? o.O
[02:18:01] <Cork> adam-lynch: no that isn't correct
[02:18:02] <krambiorix> hi, how can i get all input boxes except radio buttons? $(this).find(...........) ?
[02:18:10] <seutje> and I'm not even talking about the spelling
[02:18:22] <Cork> adam-lynch: keydown is keypress; and keypress isn't cross browser
[02:18:50] <Cork> the event naming is a bit silly there
[02:18:51] <seutje> errm I meant bigbugjava
[02:18:51] <adam-lynch> @Cork thanks
[02:18:57] <adam-lynch> weird how https://api.jquery.com/keydown/ says it's only the first time it's pressed
[02:19:04] <adam-lynch> do you know of anyway I can detect this?
[02:19:08] <Cork> adam-lynch: so if you come from another language think of keydown as keypress
[02:19:59] <Cork> there is a none cross browser event.repeat
[02:20:09] <Cork> but no i don't know of a built in way to do it correctly
[02:20:19] <Cork> you could cache the last pressed value and do something based on that
[02:20:36] <seutje> krambiorix: :input:not(:radio) ?
[02:20:39] <Cork> (but that will give you false positive)
[02:22:02] <Cork> adam-lynch: hmm, actually just store a value for if keyup has fired
[02:22:07] <Cork> and use that as a toggle
[02:22:18] <Cork> should work better; still a bit hacky
[02:22:32] <Cork> but at least it doens't have false positives
[02:23:12] <Cork> adam-lynch: i recommend reading webstandard pages about the default things instead of jquerys docs
[02:23:23] <Cork> like w3c or mdn
[02:26:04] <adam-lynch> cork: I'll have to explain my situation a little bit. I detect keydown and keyup right now. Any time a keydown is triggered (let's call it key A), I add it to a currentlyPressedKeys array. It is removed on keyup. If another key (B) is pressed while key A is pressed it will be added key A's currentlyPressedKeys entry as another key pressed while key
[02:26:04] <adam-lynch> A was pressed. Then on keyup for key A, nothing will happen if another key was pressed during the time.
[02:26:24] <adam-lynch> The problem is that's built on the assumption that keydown is only triggered on first key down
[02:27:06] <Cork> adam-lynch: so use keys in an object instead of the array
[02:27:11] <Cork> should solve it nicely for you
[02:27:34] <Cork> var currentlyPressedKeys = {}; currentlyPressedKeys[event.keyCode] = true
[02:27:53] <adam-lynch> If a user were on a different tab, held down a key A, then switched tabs and let go of the key, keydown is triggered for key A, then keyup for key A, even though the key was initially pressed on a different tab
[02:27:56] <Cork> and = false or delete when you get keyUo
[02:27:59] <Cork> *Up
[02:28:03] <adam-lynch> cork: no, that's not the problem
[02:28:33] <Cork> adam-lynch: well it kinda is
[02:28:43] <Cork> you need to check the true value and if it is filter the event
[02:31:12] <adam-lynch> cork: the problem is if you hold down a key, then change tab... the keydown event is triggered
[02:31:17] <Cork> adam-lynch: is the tab a browser tab or a page "fake" tab?
[02:31:17] <adam-lynch> when I receive that keydown event, I have no way of telling if that was actually the first time the key was pressed
[02:31:18] <adam-lynch> browser tab
[02:31:19] <Cork> interesting
[02:31:50] <Cork> never looked for a cross browser tab situation
[02:31:50] <Cork> though is this really a problem?
[02:32:08] <Cork> sounds like firing it one extra time there isn't too bad
[02:32:23] <Cork> (would even say expected)
[02:32:50] <adam-lynch> yeah... if I have a shortcut for the number 2 let's say. On mac, a user can press Alt+2 to switch tab. So if they press Alt+2 and leave go of Alt before 2, then keydown will be triggered for 2 and my event will fire
[02:34:13] <adam-lynch> cork: see what I mean?
[02:34:26] <Cork> adam-lynch: are you talking about extension code here?
[02:34:38] <adam-lynch> cork: no
[02:34:42] <Cork> sounds like a none issue for a webpage
[02:34:51] <Cork> cause you can't change what page they see from the webpage
[02:35:31] <adam-lynch> not sure you're getting me... if you press alt+2, it changes tab for mac... the keydown and then keyup is triggered for the "2" key
[02:35:49] <adam-lynch> my problem is keydown for "2" shouldn't be fired since it was initially pressed outside my tab
[02:36:02] <Cork> sure and you get the altKey value in the event
[02:36:04] <adam-lynch> but keydown isn't actually keydown, it's the same as keypress
[02:36:22] <adam-lynch> cork: no... the altKey has already been released
[02:36:30] <adam-lynch> and alt+2 is an example
[02:36:37] <adam-lynch> we have multiple shortcuts
[02:36:52] <adam-lynch> I need to detect inital key down... that's it
[02:36:53] <Cork> well if the browser fires the event it fires the event
[02:37:02] <Cork> can't say i've ever seen what you explains
[02:37:18] <Cork> but the only one that could do anything about it would be the browser
[02:37:20] <adam-lynch> or else I'm going to have to do something hacky with detecting tab change
[02:37:25] <Cork> and this sounds like a (safari?) bug
[02:37:36] <adam-lynch> well if keydown was triggered correctly, there would be a problem
[02:37:42] <adam-lynch> but keydown is triggered just like keypress
[02:37:49] <Cork> yes it is
[02:37:51] <Cork> and it is meant to
[02:37:52] <adam-lynch> no, it's not related to a specific rendering engine
[02:37:56] <Cork> ok
[02:38:06] <Cork> then make a demo in jsbin where you can show this
[02:39:24] <adam-lynch> http://jsfiddle.net/nTT47/
[02:39:32] <adam-lynch> already linked this at the start
[02:41:51] <seutje> u want it to not fire continuously when held?
[02:42:03] <diegoviola> hi
[02:42:09] <seutje> could just debounce to the start and call it a day
[02:42:14] <diegoviola> i need to add in-place-editing to some rails app here, what do you guys recommend for this?
[02:42:25] <Cork> adam-lynch: can't reproduce it
[02:42:36] <Cork> if i switch to the tab with the keyboard i get no event
[02:42:42] <Cork> if i switch away though i do
[02:43:01] <Cork> seutje: he gets keydown when switching focus to the page with the keyboard
[02:43:07] <Cork> (so keydown fires on focus)
[02:43:27] <seutje> oh, on like a touch screen?
[02:43:33] <Cork> no
[02:43:41] <seutje> oh ok, tabbing
[02:43:43] <Cork> on like alt+<tab number>
[02:43:50] <Cork> but i can't reproduce
[02:44:05] <Cork> might be a mac thing though
[02:44:26] <Cork> there keyboard focus/event structure is a bit weird
[02:44:55] <seutje> Cork: do u focus the results frame first?
[02:45:03] <diegoviola> any ideas please
[02:45:07] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/nTT47/2/show/
[02:46:39] <seutje> weird, it was doing it a second ago, but may have been alt-tabbing rather than switching tabs withing chrome
[02:47:41] <Cork> seutje: i can reproduce it away from the tab/window
[02:47:44] <Cork> but never TO it
[02:49:41] <seutje> yeah, seems to be the case
[02:58:18] <beasty_> morning all
[03:03:05] <bigbugjava> Fancybox Issue, I add content to the fancybox, now I have a button there, when I hit him, it does the what the it's purpose to do, but fancybox dones't close..
[03:03:29] <seutje> but if its purpose is to close the fancybox, it isn't really living up to its purpose, now is it?
[03:04:26] <Cork> and you shouldn't hit ppl, it isn't nice :)
[03:04:39] <Cork> even if there name happen to be button
[03:04:39] <seutje> some people do it professionally though
[03:04:49] <Cork> heh true
[03:04:52] <seutje> like... the NYPD
[03:04:56] <mepl> when posting a div to a html doc from an external php file. Using a click event on it seem's impossible.
[03:05:18] <mepl> Please tell me I'm wrong
[03:05:18] <bigbugjava> the button moves the page in background to currect spot, but fancybox stays ontop of the page
[03:05:19] <Cork> mepl: va?
[03:05:20] <Cork> *what?
[03:05:23] <Cork> (opps wrong language...)
[03:05:35] <mepl> from?
[03:05:36] <seutje> bigbugjava: it probably uses fixed positioning in the CSS
[03:05:53] <Cork> mepl: are you loading the html through ajax or something?
[03:05:59] <mepl> I post html content from a php file, then I want to use a click event on the content submitted.
[03:06:00] <seutje> mepl: how do you post from php to html, usually it's the other way around o.O
[03:06:06] <mepl> Cork, yes
[03:06:19] <Cork> are you using delegated event handlers
[03:06:22] <seutje> oh, delegate the event with .on() to a higher parent
[03:06:28] <Cork> or are you binding them after you have added the content
[03:06:35] <mepl> so much responses... am confused.
[03:06:47] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[03:06:48] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:06:49] <mepl> I load content every second
[03:06:53] <Cork> read that page
[03:06:55] <seutje> FINE!
[03:07:02] * seutje goes back to staring at his DB import running
[03:07:30] <Cork> mepl: read that page
[03:07:53] <interop_madness> is there a way to bind an event handler to DOM elements that have yet to be added to the DOM? i.e. i have a lazy-loaded treeview where each treenode has a checkbox and i want to bind to the change event of all checkboxes
[03:08:00] <Cork> ...
[03:08:01] <mepl> yeah I got it...
[03:08:02] <mepl> oh yeah!!
[03:08:18] <Cork> interop_madness: lol you missed the answer for that with 3 secs...
[03:08:20] <mepl> Cork: you did not answer my question, where are you from? I reckon that "va?"
[03:08:24] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[03:08:26] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:08:33] <Cork> mepl: sweden
[03:09:03] <Cork> interop_madness: ^ read that page
[03:09:56] <interop_madness> Cork, thanks. another question: do i need to unbind the event handlers? or does the browser magically clean up everything once i destroy the whole container element?
[03:10:21] <interop_madness> i always am afraid of resource leaks
[03:10:30] <Cork> interop_madness: the browsers gc removed the attached functions when the element is removed
[03:10:44] <Cork> just make sure nothing holds on to the element after you remove it from the dom
[03:10:53] <interop_madness> Cork, is there any type of leaking i must watch out for in general?
[03:11:52] <Cork> interop_madness: global variables is one of the big ones
[03:12:09] <Cork> jquerys prevObject is another nasty one
[03:13:08] <interop_madness> ok thanks
[03:14:37] <ZeuZ> I've developed a small script that downloads a file to a var, firefox doesn't lock up et all, but chrome does. POC: fulldownloads.webege.com/index.html?datos=1234test1234 ---> click PROBAR twice
[03:14:43] <ccapndave> Hey all - I am trying to use find() to find a certain node but can't figure out the syntax.  https://gist.github.com/ccapndave/9207058 is my source, and I want to find all ScanJobs with a PageState of 'PreparingScan'.  Is there a way to do this?
[03:14:47] <ZeuZ> What can I do to prevent chromium from locking?
[03:15:16] <ccapndave> I am fiddling about with :has, but can't get the exact query
[03:17:13] * Woet slaps Uhkis around a bit with a large trout
[03:22:49] <Uhkis> :O
[03:42:38] <bigbugjava> I want to add a close button to Fancybox, cant seem to trigger the closer, anyone ever tried this?
[03:46:47] <ZeuZ> what's wrong with this: if ($('#checkbox').is(':checked')) $('#textarea').append('checked');
[03:46:48] <ZeuZ>  ????
[03:47:47] <dwarder> ZeuZ: nothing
[03:47:47] <ZeuZ> wonder why it ain't working then
[03:47:47] <Clex> ZeuZ: .append ?
[03:47:48] <shoky> is #textarea a <textarea> ?
[03:47:48] <ZeuZ> yup, it's a textarea
[03:47:49] <shoky> then you need to use .val()
[03:47:55] <Clex> ZeuZ: try .val() instead no?
[03:48:35] <Biwaa_> ZeuZ:  just do it like this ? if ($('#checkbox:checked')) $('#textarea').append('checked');
[03:48:54] <shoky> Biwaa_ no that's no good
[03:49:06] <shoky> that will always return a truthy value like that..
[03:49:25] <ZeuZ> shoky, how then?
[03:49:43] <shoky> ZeuZ:  like you did it. just with val not append
[03:50:27] <shoky> of course, that line by itself doesn't set any event handlers so don't expect anything to happen magically when you check the checkbox
[03:51:36] <ZeuZ> nope I know, it's inside a .on('click',function(){});
[03:52:49] <ZeuZ> shoky, http://fulldownloads.webege.com/index.html?datos=1234test1234 ---> still not working tho..
[03:53:19] <ZeuZ> if ($('#checkbox').val()=='on') $('#textarea').append('checked\n');
[03:53:19] <ZeuZ>  ---> set up like this
[03:53:48] <shoky> that's not what we said..
[03:53:54] <shoky> .val instead of append
[03:53:58] <ZeuZ> oh
[03:54:01] <shoky> not .val instead of .is(':checked')
[03:54:28] <ZeuZ> why not append() ?
[03:54:48] <shoky> because at runtime you need to change the textarea's value, not its innerHTML
[03:54:54] <shoky> just like <input>s
[03:55:25] <ZeuZ> but I need it to append it, not erase the rest
[03:55:38] <ZeuZ> I've been using append in the rest of the script, for example.. should I change that too?
[03:55:50] <shoky> if you want it to change the textarea's text.. yes
[03:56:02] <ZeuZ> but the rest does work..
[03:56:10] <shoky> where?
[03:56:32] <ZeuZ> for example here: $('#Resultado').append(">> Descarga finalizada.");
[03:56:33] <ZeuZ>  in line 74 of the script
[03:56:39] <ZeuZ> well all of the appends before work
[03:57:27] <shoky> ok.. i thought that doesn't work. but it's better to use .val i think
[03:58:14] <ZeuZ> actually could you take a look at it? if I run the code in firebug (if ($('#verificarDescarga').is(':checked')) $('#Resultado').append('Se realizarà la verificación de la descarga, esto puede tomar su tiempo..\n');
[03:58:14] <ZeuZ> ) it'll work correctly
[03:59:37] <shoky> ok, append only works until the value is actually changed (by the user or code)
[03:59:53] <shoky> since your textarea is disabled i guess it doesn't matter much...
[04:00:01] <shoky> but it's still best to use .val
[04:00:05] <ZeuZ> nevermind, I just changed the position of the code and it worked.. don't understand why tho...
[04:00:12] <shoky> that's the proper way to set a textarea's text at runtime
[04:00:14] <ZeuZ> noted in the cheatsheet though to use val() instead
[04:00:18] <ZeuZ> got it
[04:05:52] <Cork> ZeuZ: some site information; form elements only use the html until it is changed live for some reason
[04:08:02] <Cork> that is why .val helps cause it use the prototypes to update the content of the fields in a way that all browsers detect it
[04:08:16] <manus> Quick question I couldn't find the answer to by googling: any plans to deprecate .delegate()/.bind() ?
[04:08:21] <Cork> no
[04:08:29] <manus> Any reason why not? Docs say it supersedes the older methods. Why keep them around?
[04:08:35] <Cork> manus: cause it would add compatibility problems for no good reason
[04:09:13] <Cork> manus: those functions are the same code as on anyway
[04:09:15] <manus> Cork: so why are any functions deprecated?
[04:09:23] <Cork> 1. they break coding standards and cause probems (.live)
[04:09:35] <Cork> they have there own cost and breaks how things is meant to work
[04:09:48] <Cork> bind and delegate is basically the same as on
[04:10:01] <Cork> it is the same reason we haven't removed .click => .on('click'
[04:10:58] <seutje> hate those convenience methods
[04:10:58] <seutje> load is the worst
[04:10:58] <Cork> well ya, me too
[04:11:08] <Cork> click() vs click(function() {}) isn't much better
[04:11:22] <Cork> but ya load is way overloaded
[04:11:22] <manus> Cork: I understand the convenience of aliases, bot why document that .on supersedes the others without enforcing it (eg. by deprecating them)?
[04:11:26] <seutje> load also has load(str)
[04:11:46] <Cork> manus: supersedes isn't the same as deprecate
[04:11:51] <Cork> it just means "it is preferred"
[04:12:06] <manus> Cork: so it's a weak "you should probably not do this"
[04:12:07] <seutje> one is correctly spelled, the other isn't :P
[04:12:09] <Cork> seutje: ya i know
[04:12:18] <Cork> manus: no
[04:12:25] <Cork> that is way overstating it
[04:12:40] <manus> Cork: ah, ok
[04:13:04] <manus> more of a "you know, you're really just using .on, so why not just use it?"
[04:13:09] <seutje> deprecated = going away soon; superceded = this other thing does the same, but better/more
[04:13:20] <Cork> ya
[04:13:30] <Cork> and as bind + delegate == on
[04:13:41] <Cork> though i argue the "better" part
[04:13:58] <Cork> it sure isn't better for new developers
[04:14:05] <seutje> usually if it's straight up better, it gets deprecated
[04:14:18] <Cork> it has to be the function causing the most confusion for the last year
[04:14:30] <seutje> yeah, guess prop/attr was last year :P
[04:14:36] <manus> Cork: .on ?
[04:14:39] <Cork> ya
[04:14:44] <manus> ah, I see
[04:14:56] <manus> that answers my question, I guess
[04:15:00] <Cork> seutje: well prop/attr is actually easy to explain
[04:15:13] <Cork> the current state of .on is just sad
[04:15:30] <manus> because there are too many methods for event delegation, people are confused which one to use, so let them have their choice
[04:15:32] <seutje> how so?
[04:15:33] <Cork> "oh you need to use .on instead, but you can't just replace it you need to read the doc first"
[04:15:46] <Cork> ppl read the doc and uses on in the bind syntax
[04:15:48] <Cork> *GAH*
[04:15:58] <seutje> oh lol
[04:16:00] <Cork> so to get them to do it right you have to point them to .delegate
[04:16:12] <Cork> that.. for some lovely reason the bot has blocked
[04:16:15] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:16:15] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:16:25] <Cork> oh, they removed it
[04:16:55] <Cork> anyway merging is much harder to explain then separating
[04:17:02] <krambiorix> seutje, i forgot to thank you for 2 hours ago :)
[04:17:04] <bigbugjava> sorry for repeating, the error just changes, so I figgure to try, I'm now getting this Fancybox message: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'close' of undefined" , for this simple code :  <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$.fancybox.close();">close</a>
[04:17:05] <Cork> cause then you have to point to a section a bit down a page
[04:17:12] <seutje> krambiorix: no need
[04:17:20] <Cork> and actually hope the reader goes there
[04:17:43] <seutje> bigbugjava: this doesn't show if fancybox is even included or anythiing
[04:18:00] <seutje> but yeah, in that scope, $.fancybox is undefined
[04:18:02] <krambiorix> in a div i have some tables in tables ... I only want to get the first level tables... How can i do that?
[04:18:22] <seutje> div > table
[04:18:42] <mepl> I have this wide div with a click event. When I click it I change its background color. However, inside this div I have a button. When I click this button I do not want the background color to change. The click area seems to be on top of everything else.
[04:19:09] <mepl> pseudo: $('#id').click(everything but .button)
[04:19:11] <seutje> mepl: event.stopPropagation() on the button's click event
[04:19:49] <mepl> seutje: other jquery stuff do happen when you press this button.
[04:19:52] <mepl> Will this cancel that aswell
[04:20:19] <bigbugjava> seutje why is it undefined?
[04:21:06] <Cork> mepl: in the click handler check if event.target is the button
[04:21:29] <Cork> $(event.target).closest('button').length > 0
[04:21:34] <Laire> Hello,
[04:22:00] <seutje> mepl: or just check e.target against this -> http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/
[04:22:03] <Cork> seutje: careful with stopping events
[04:22:22] <Cork> it has bitten me HARD in an earlier project
[04:22:33] <seutje> mepl: stopPropagation doesn't stop the event from firing, it just stops it from bubbling up, e.preventDefault() stops it from firing (sorta)
[04:22:53] <seutje> Cork: yeah, realized it's more flexible to check it on the other handler
[04:22:56] <krambiorix> seutje , in reply to div > table ... can i do something like $(this).find('table') but only first level?
[04:22:57] <Cork> seutje: no preventDefault prevents the browser default action
[04:23:03] <Cork> the event still fires and it bubbles
[04:23:04] <seutje> krambiorix: children()
[04:23:14] <seutje> Cork: hence (sorta)
[04:24:34] <Cork> seutje: hmm the second code snippet won't work if he has any other children in the foo div
[04:25:03] <Laire> Please excuse my bad english, I hope you will understand what I am saying. when I inject html in a domnode of my document jquery mobile doesn't parse it. in this case I inject the search results as a listview under the search form and it doesnt look like the jquery mobile list view. when I insert the code for testing from beginning in the source code it will be shown, like it should be.
[04:25:08] <seutje> Cork: how so? http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/1/
[04:25:43] <mepl> seutje: I built this from your example, http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/
[04:25:46] <mepl> still cant trigger anything
[04:25:59] <seutje> that *is* the example
[04:26:17] <mepl> yup, I removed my test case
[04:26:44] <Cork> seutje: click the text => nothing happens http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/2/
[04:27:16] <seutje> Cork: wasn't that desired behavior? only act when the outer one is clicked?
[04:27:34] <Cork> seutje: if i read his question correctly he just wants to exclude a specific button
[04:28:02] <mepl> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/3/
[04:28:03] <Cork> meaning http://jsfiddle.net/n57pn/4/
[04:28:13] <seutje> then it seems more sensible to use stopPropagation imo
[04:28:57] <Cork> stopPropagation can bite you later if you need to catch click events for some other reason
[04:29:09] <seutje> mepl: yeah, u bound to a row, u can't rly click the row, only the THs
[04:29:23] <mepl> Cork: I modified that example and it did work.
[04:29:24] <mepl> Okay
[04:29:27] <seutje> Cork: sure it can, but otherwise you'd need to exclude it from all other handlers
[04:29:41] <Cork> seutje: well, sure
[04:29:57] <Cork> seutje: btw this is basically what delegate does already :)
[04:30:01] <seutje> having to remember it for everything that touches is could also be considered biting you in the ass
[04:30:12] <seutje> suppose, goes both ways
[04:30:15] <Cork> seutje: everything?
[04:30:27] <Cork> you just want it where you want to not have the bubble effect
[04:30:38] <Cork> normally that is the exception not the rule
[04:30:42] <seutje> exactly
[04:30:55] <seutje> so u put the exception on the exception and not on everything else
[04:30:59] <Cork> so meaning stopPropagation makes the exception the rule
[04:31:05] <Cork> and the norm impossible
[04:31:09] <seutje> wat?
[04:31:22] <seutje> 1 handler stopPropagating vs all others doing a check
[04:31:39] <Cork> one handler don't want events from a specific handler; so a handler is bound to that specific element stopping it from bubbling
[04:31:55] <Cork> if anyone want to have the event ; pitty for them
[04:32:10] <seutje> it's not immediate propagation
[04:32:14] <Cork> my point is the all over doing
[04:32:26] <Cork> it usually isn't more then one or two places top
[04:32:40] <Cork> the other want the unfiltered events
[04:32:50] <seutje> "usually" is pretty meaningless when you aren't alone on the project
[04:33:11] <Cork> seutje: it is even more important to not break the expectation of how the page works
[04:33:38] <Cork> having a click event disappear on the page is... ugg...
[04:34:10] <Cork> like dynamically creating a widget with a plugin
[04:34:18] <Cork> but you can't delegate a click action to something you have in it
[04:34:31] <Cork> cause the widget stopPropagation all click events from the widget
[04:34:38] <seutje> the button has specific behavior already overriding the default
[04:34:43] <Cork> a perfect example where "i own the world" break things
[04:35:03] <Cork> seutje: but you don't know if anyone want to add additional functionality to that button
[04:35:07] <seutje> so instead the whole world should know eachother
[04:35:16] <seutje> they can
[04:35:21] <Cork> not really
[04:35:26] <Cork> as the event doesn't bubble
[04:36:03] <Cork> $(document).click(session_keep_alive) <- an example where it bit me
[04:36:23] <Cork> opps was keyup not click
[04:36:30] <seutje> the button one is already delegated though, so it will bubble partially regardless
[04:36:43] <Cork> and the session kept timing out cause a lot of widgets on the page kept killing the event
[04:36:58] <Cork> so when ppl typed in a textarea the page didn't know about it
[04:37:08] <seutje> this handler polled the server or something?
[04:37:18] <seutje> tbh, that one is a bit fucking extreme
[04:37:24] <Cork> it was a lock feature
[04:37:34] <seutje> and erm, where would it bubble to?
[04:37:37] <Cork> where the page switched to a login page after a time
[04:37:42] <Cork> seutje: to the document
[04:37:51] <Cork> where the event listener was bound
[04:37:53] <seutje> but it's caught *on* the document
[04:37:58] <Cork> sure
[04:38:09] <seutje> only stopImmediatePropagation would be troublesome then
[04:38:10] <mepl> Ok, so I manage to get that script going. http://jsfiddle.net/qFn73/ so I change the tr colour when click. But when I click another tr I want it to change background back and change on the $(this) selector. I tried this with a for each tr set background to #fff then add the new background to $(this) but it seems like such a lousy solution.
[04:38:14] <mepl> Maybe it's the best?
[04:38:25] <Cork> but 54 levels down an event listener did $(something).on('keyup', function(e) { e.stopPropagation() })
[04:38:31] <Laire> Why it don't shwo me the list as jquery mobile listview, when I insert it when I click on the "Suchen" Button? -> http://jsfiddle.net/eTz8H/
[04:38:39] <Cork> seutje: meaning everything happening in that element was not happening to the page
[04:38:57] <Cork> THAT is why stopPropagation is a really bad idea
[04:40:35] <Cork> you expect things around you to work the way it does at the point of writing the code
[04:40:47] <seutje> sounds pretty asinine to begin with
[04:40:49] <seutje> so if you don't type for too long, it switched?
[04:40:50] <mepl> yeah I solved it this way http://jsfiddle.net/qFn73/1/
[04:40:51] <Cork> seutje: it used more hooks too
[04:40:54] <Cork> seutje: but the point is those event didn't happen; at all
[04:40:57] <Cork> and assuming that is fine IS the point of what i mean is the problem
[04:41:00] <seutje> trading one set of problems for another, but alright
[04:41:00] <Cork> you can't know if someone in 5 years might want to have this event outside of your code
[04:41:41] <Cork> so don't assume it
[04:41:42] <Cork> seutje: the other problem is rarely a problem
[04:41:42] <seutje> you mean, like markup changing?
[04:41:59] <Cork> i mean like if you add something to your page you add checks for what you don't want to know about
[04:42:10] <seutje> like I said, trading one set for another, which one is worse depends heavily on the situation
[04:42:23] <Cork> having to modify code all over the place just cause you want to add a feature to a completely unrelated peace of code is a problem
[04:43:03] <Cork> seutje: i've never seen an example where you get a lot of external dependencies not wanting to know normal dom events
[04:43:18] <Cork> and in those cases you could provide a special hook for the plugin
[04:43:19] <seutje> that's quite a jump
[04:44:01] <Cork> but sure please provide an example where it would cause problem
[04:44:12] <Cork> i'm always interested in odd cases
[04:44:45] <seutje> already did
[04:45:09] <seutje> changing markup, adding features that live in the same space
[04:45:19] <Cork> and why would they care about exceptins like this?
[04:45:28] <seutje> now they explicitly need to know about it and add it as an exception
[04:45:31] <Cork> like if a button was clicked in the widget
[04:45:45] <Cork> they can't add exception
[04:45:56] <seutje> really? that's where we started, wanting to exclude the button
[04:46:11] <Cork> they can if they are lucky find the element after it was created but before the event fired and bind directly to it
[04:46:26] <Cork> that isn't exception
[04:46:29] <seutje> they'll need the same check
[04:46:51] <seutje> "if it isn't this one specific one, do stuff" isn't an exception?
[04:46:52] <Cork> seutje: but in this case like in my experience most cases
[04:46:59] <Cork> you want an exception for a specific event handler
[04:47:06] <Cork> not for all possible event handlers
[04:47:36] <Cork> and like i've said, i've never seen a case where you need to block an event from ever being used in bubbling
[04:47:58] <Cork> and that is what you argued is a case you see (a lot?)
[04:48:18] <Cork> so please explain one such case
[04:50:12] <seutje> I give up, not going over it again, just scroll up or something
[04:50:27] <Cork> seutje: you never gave an example
[04:51:29] <Laire> What I have to do that jquery mobile parse a listview wich i injected with an event after the page loaded?
[04:51:41] <seutje> 2 actually, but ok
[05:06:49] <Laire> Why jquery mobile doesn't interprate my inserted code (click() event): http://jsfiddle.net/eTz8H/
[05:09:58] <seutje> Laire: http://jsfiddle.net/eTz8H/1/
[05:11:58] <Laire> seutje: thx
[05:25:00] <ankurk___> Can anyone help me with this StackOverflow question? http://bit.ly/1o327fy
[05:25:49] <ankurk___> I have tried everything but I am not able to get what I want
[05:26:19] <ankurk___> basically I want the rows with closed date at the top and rows without closed date at the bottom
[05:26:52] <ankurk___> and this is making me insane
[05:27:38] <ankurk___> and I want to sort the rows with closed date in the end
[05:31:16] <ankurk___> I swear I would treat you with beer if it this gets solved.
[05:37:12] <DRSK> So appendTo() puts my element last in the designated element, how do I put it as first?
[05:37:28] <DRSK> just use .before() on the child?
[05:38:22] <DRSK> oh right there's prependTo as well =)
[05:40:16] <ankurk___> is xKraty around?
[05:40:24] <xKraty> nope
[05:40:31] <ankurk___> :P
[05:40:34] <ankurk___> okay
[05:40:48] <xKraty> should we call him?
[05:41:19] <ankurk___> yeah
[05:41:31] <ankurk___> because he helped me last time I remember :P
[05:41:32] * xKraty kraty arrives
[05:41:39] <ankurk___> *yayyy*
[05:42:17] <ankurk___> Sir, could you help me with this issue? http://bit.ly/1o327fy
[05:42:30] <ankurk___> I still owe you a beer for last time :)
[05:42:34] <xKraty> quite busy but let me check quickly
[05:42:56] <xKraty> empty cell when filtering?
[05:42:58] <seutje> ankurk___: aren't you suppose to return 1, 0 or -1 in sort functions?
[05:43:23] <ankurk___> yep
[05:43:49] <ankurk___> seutje: instead of true or false?
[05:46:17] <seutje> so why are you returning true/false and some number that will probably be way > 1
[05:46:17] <ankurk___> I think since I am sorting using data-attributes that might be an issue
[05:46:18] <DRSK> How do I have a few elements, specifically <a ..><span><span></></></a>, set up to be "inserted" to another parent element? Do I just do var $myHTML = '<a href..><span>'; and then $myHTML.appendTo( myDiv ) ?
[05:46:21] <seutje> doesn't matter where the data is coming from
[05:46:23] <DRSK> I have 3 buttons I need to 'create' and 'appendTo' a certain element.
[05:46:24] <DRSK> What would be a good approach of doing so?
[05:46:28] <ankurk___> seutje: something along these lines? http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/1178/sorting-dates-handling-null-values/p1
[05:48:38] <ghostlines> good afternoon, I'm getting an unexpected identifier error with this script but my editor can't find any errors http://pastebin.com/4TnLYncA
[05:49:04] <seutje> ankurk___: actually, spec only mentions positive value, negative value and zero
[05:49:08] <seutje> http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.4.11
[05:49:43] <ankurk___> ohh!
[05:50:16] <ankurk___> seutje: I just tried the link I found, it works but not in the way I want, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/18/edit
[05:51:08] <ankurk___> I essentially want to keep the rows with blank closed dates at the bottom.
[05:51:43] <seutje> ankurk___: the isNaN check has x take precedence
[05:51:59] <seutje> e.g. if they both don't have a closeddate, X will be before Y
[05:52:11] <ankurk___> so it should be either way?
[05:52:56] <seutje> yeah guess the x == y anyway
[05:53:45] <ankurk___> I might be missing you somewhere, could edit my jsbin and show me?
[05:58:59] <seutje> looks like the dates are parsed wrong to begin with
[06:00:16] <ankurk___> ahh
[06:00:18] <ankurk___> damn
[06:00:34] <ankurk___> It should be timestamp if I may guess?
[06:03:31] <Laire> seutje: now I have the next problem, i give the <a> a class and isert a handler for a click event on this class, but it don't work: http://jsfiddle.net/eTz8H/3/
[06:07:00] <Cork> ghostlines: look for none ascii characters
[06:07:21] <Cork> it is most likely what you see (a different space character for example)
[06:08:11] <ghostlines> Cork, thx I found it
[06:08:24] <ghostlines> I was missing parentheses, I'm use to python
[06:08:30] <Cork> ah
[06:08:30] <ghostlines> won't be making that mistake again
[06:08:34] <Cork> ya i just saw that :)
[06:09:05] <seutje> Laire: either move it to the function responsible for injecting it, or delegate it (and fix that list variable from leaking into the global scope)
[06:10:22] <seutje> probably worth noting jQuery mobile has specific events for this sorta shit, like pageinit
[06:10:22] <Laire> What do you mean with: and fix that list variable from leaking into the global scope ?
[06:10:58] <seutje> slap a "var" in front of it
[06:12:00] <Laire> ok
[06:14:49] <krambiorix> a bit late seutje, but thanks , it worked :D
[06:19:08] <kazim59> If I return a promise in the function passed to .then(...), then the return value of then should be resolved when that promise resolves?
[06:19:33] <shoky> kazim59: yep
[06:19:41] <kazim59> shoky: not working for me. This is from which version upwards? I'm on 1.7.2
[06:21:45] <shoky> in 1.7.2 you might need .pipe instead of .then
[06:22:19] <kazim59> shoky: the .then exists in my version, but probably not using its return
[06:22:20] <shoky> yes .then existed but it was different
[06:22:21] <shoky> in 1.8 it changed to be like .pipe
[06:22:21] <shoky> and to replace .pipe in fact
[06:28:15] <ankurk___> Something is still not right :/

[06:29:55] <Jayflux> hey guys, I want to change a scrollLeft value of a div and animate it too
[06:30:16] <Jayflux> but im unsure if its going to be increment or decrement i just have the new value, putting that in doesn't seem to work
[06:30:22] <Jayflux> whats the best of way of doing this
[06:30:55] <xKraty> oh gosh dat table ankurk___
[06:31:14] <ankurk___> xKraty: that table will kill me someday
[06:31:27] <xKraty> sorry for not answering quite busy :(
[06:31:44] <ankurk___> ahh I can understand
[06:31:54] <ankurk___> Don't want to disturb you
[06:32:37] <decx> isnt that just sortign tables? what's wrong with the tablesorter plugin?
[06:32:44] <decx> oh right, no plugins
[06:33:13] <ankurk___> decx: if I could do it with plugins, I would be done with it long time ago
[06:33:21] <ankurk___> Damn my boss.
[06:35:18] <ankurk___> and I hate to come here bother people.
[06:35:22] <ankurk___> *&
[06:36:28] <decx> well you might not be able to use third party plugins
[06:36:45] <decx> but that's not stopping you from looking at https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/tree/master/js and getting some 'hints' ;)
[06:37:29] <ankurk___> I am not allowed to since my boss thinks it would be heavy
[06:37:58] <ankurk___> To be honest, that amount of code looks gibberish to me :P
[06:38:07] <ankurk___> I get scared :P
[06:41:09] <decx> i get it, but sorting a table is apparently not done with a quick 3 line job ;)
[06:41:20] <rethus> I'd like to use jquery modal. but i only need a black overlay, and a modal with one close-button (no title-bar).
[06:41:29] <rethus> can i set this as parameter?
[06:42:16] <decx> do you mean dialog from jquery ui?
[06:43:06] <ankurk___> decx: you're right though
[06:43:54] <decx> if your boss has a client that pays for people reinventing the wheel, good for you ;)
[06:44:14] <rethus> decx: yes
[06:44:56] <decx> rethus find all your options here http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[06:45:13] <ankurk___> decx: sad thing is, it's just for internal use in the company
[06:45:22] <decx> yikes
[06:46:08] <ankurk___> Me -> Bad Luck Brian
[06:49:25] <masscrx> hi
[06:51:13] <ankurk___> If anyone's interested I updated my StackOverflow question, http://bit.ly/1o327fy
[06:52:34] <logbird> any idea what might be wrong in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cw9G6/
[06:52:34] <masscrx> i want to have form with items, now i have form with one item, but i want to add some button, when i press it new div should append
[06:52:43] <masscrx> now i have something like this:
[06:52:45] <masscrx> http://pastebin.com/N5sFXye0
[06:53:42] <masscrx> what should I do ? for new appended div, <select id=""> id - should increment
[06:54:01] <Cork> logbird: as long as you enter a valid date string it works just fine here
[06:54:35] <logbird> Cork: im only entering 10:30
[06:54:43] <logbird> 10:30:45
[06:54:47] <logbird> like that
[06:55:41] <Cork> logbird: that isn't a valid date
[06:56:03] <Cork> 2014-01-01T02:03:00 for example
[06:56:08] <logbird> Cork:  i just need to enter hours, minutes and seconds not the entire date
[06:56:17] <Cork> then you can't use new Date()
[06:56:19] <ankurk___> I think i need a coffee
[06:56:43] <Cork> you would have to either fake the date part
[06:56:49] <Cork> or parse the string manually
[06:57:17] <Cork> logbird: ex. http://jsfiddle.net/cw9G6/1/
[06:57:40] <DRSK> var size = []; size.push({ w: '100px', h: '200px'}); console.log( size[w] ); <-- w not defined?
[06:57:59] <Cork> logbird: though you would have to handle if end is less then start
[06:58:09] <Cork> so you go over to the next day
[06:58:27] <Cork> DRSK: size[0].w
[06:58:32] <DRSK> oh
[06:58:59] <Cork> DRSK: you pushing an object into an array
[06:59:26] <DRSK> Cork » what's the alternative? Basically I just want size to hold w/h and be done with it :D
[06:59:32] <decx> also it would be size[0]['w'] in that style
[06:59:54] <Cork> DRSK: size = { w: '100px', h: '200px'}
[07:00:05] <DRSK> ahh
[07:00:32] <Cork> so var size; size = {};
[07:00:42] <Cork> (with the keys [lazy])
[07:03:58] <DRSK> Cork » and how do I do that? lol
[07:04:33] <DRSK> size = {w,h} doesn't work, do I need { w: '', h: '' } ?
[07:05:40] <ankurk___> Someone give me a hammer. Please.
[07:06:21] <decx> size.w = '100px'; size.h = '200px'
[07:10:02] <logbird> Cork:  any idea why im getting the format hh:mm.ss
[07:10:07] <logbird> dot in seconds
[07:10:41] <hellothere> hey yosssssssssssssssssssss :) anyone ever used datatables ?
[07:12:31] <TheEternalAbyss> hello, this may be a silly question but I'm using jquery to dynamically switch between stylesheets (so users can switch between 'themes' on my site). I am able to have the css files switch, I see all the styles change but, whenever the switch happens, I lose all styles for a split second and then the new style loads. Would doing this through an ajax call prevent that unstyled "flash" to occur? or is there another way to ensure that
[07:12:31] <TheEternalAbyss>  doesn't happen?
[07:16:00] <hellothere> TheEternalAbyss: you will always see the difference even for split second :)
[07:16:20] <TheEternalAbyss> boo... :(
[07:16:37] <xinming> Just curious, Is it possible to throw an error which can be caught within the error handler of $.ajax call please?
[07:17:00] <hellothere> example xinming
[07:17:31] <xinming> for now, When I use    console.log("Test start"); $.ajax({ error: function () { throw new Error("This is my error") }, async: false, url: ... });  console.log("Test end");
[07:17:34] <TheEternalAbyss> hellothere: that makes me sad really..
[07:17:53] <xinming> After the error 'This is my error' thrown, We can still see the Test end in console output
[07:18:16] <xinming> If I understand correctly on Exception, All remaining code shouldn't be processed after the throw, right?
[07:18:19] <hellothere> remove the console log then ?:D
[07:18:37] <xinming> hellothere: No, I'm just testing, Because if we got error, I need it to return directly
[07:19:00] <hellothere> but you mean the test end shows in the console even if you dont get the error ?
[07:19:01] <xinming> I have a function, If it has ajax errors, I wish it to be return directly.
[07:19:23] <xinming> hellothere: Yes, It shows, That's not what I want.
[07:19:39] <ska-fan> In qunit, can I make it so that whenever an assertion fails an exception is raised and not caught so that the chrome webdev debugger breakpoints on it and I can inspect the situation
[07:19:42] <xinming> that's why I was thinking wether I did something wrong, or this is the known bug in jquery.
[07:20:04] <hellothere> well you cant interrupt it and that means that you are getting error no matter what so you should check your code format again
[07:20:25] <xinming> hellothere: But if it's an exception,
[07:20:35] <hellothere> well as i see from that little script you posted console.log is not nested in any functions
[07:20:40] <hellothere> is just floating on its own
[07:20:42] <xinming> Shouldn't the Exception return control directly to the caller?
[07:21:00] <xinming> hmm, It's in an function.
[07:21:04] <xinming> bbl
[07:21:36] <hellothere> ye but you need to assigned it in the error function
[07:23:46] <xinming> hellothere: the exception is raised in error function.
[07:24:57] <hellothere> ok then if the console log still shows without the error showing it means that for some reason either its not nested properly = syntax errors or you still get the error
[07:25:21] <xinming> hellothere: It's not the syntax error
[07:25:32] <Cork> logbird: i would do it like this http://jsfiddle.net/cw9G6/2/
[07:25:36] <xinming> What I got in firebug console is saying we have unhandled error.
[07:25:44] <xinming> hellothere: http://paste.lisp.org/display/141365
[07:25:53] <xinming> hellothere: That's just illusration on what I'm going to do.
[07:26:13] <Cork> logbird: though you would still have to input it as hh:mm:ss
[07:26:19] * Cork runs away
[07:26:25] <xinming> In that example, The 'try' block doesn't catch the error.
[07:26:30] <xinming> and let them pass through.
[07:26:59] <logbird> Cork: still showing . in seconds
[07:27:11] <logbird> im not able to store it that way right?
[07:28:15] <ankurk___> Mother of God :D http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/23/edit
[07:28:22] <hellothere> aham well I had that before and it seemed it was indeed a jquery problem
[07:28:33] <hellothere> sometimes in several brows the try catch doesnt work
[07:28:49] <ankurk___> all thanks to yansanmo from #javascript
[07:29:58] <xinming> hellothere: So, Do we have some work around for this problem?
[07:31:44] <hellothere> well for me i had to go to serverside
[07:34:10] <xKraty> ankurk___: just back from meeting with boss X_x did you fix it?
[07:34:48] <ankurk___> xKraty: someone from #javascript helped me. http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/23/edit :D
[07:35:39] <ankurk___> Solution is really simple and again I was going through a complicated way.
[07:36:25] <ankurk___> Damn, I really need to force my brain to start thinking in simple ways.
[07:38:28] <bristleback> Hi
[07:39:26] <bristleback> I have a variable containg HTML code that needs to be added on the page. before I add that code in the DOM, I need to attach an event to some of its elements
[07:39:52] <bristleback> to find the elements I'm doing this: $(element).find(".class-to-find")
[07:40:01] <bristleback> but this returns an emptu element
[07:40:08] <bristleback> how can I do that search?
[07:40:13] <bristleback> *empty
[07:40:20] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Use .filter() instead since you're probably looking at the root nodes.
[07:41:12] <decx> why find/filter when you wan to attach an event?
[07:41:14] <ankurk___> On a side note, I need to start answering questions on StackOverflow more.
[07:41:42] <ankurk___> and anyone here uses IRCCloud?
[07:41:45] <Pupeno> Any ideas what could cause the jquery file upload plug in to make drag-and-drop send an html request instead of a json one?
[07:41:46] <BillCriswell> decx has a really good point bristleback. Yo ucan probably do $(element).on('click', foo);
[07:41:47] <bristleback> because I first need to find those elements
[07:42:42] <BillCriswell> bristleback: You already have them selected technically... I think.
[07:42:46] <BillCriswell> Let me try it.
[07:42:47] <bristleback> not working with filter either
[07:43:40] <BillCriswell> bristleback: http://jsbin.com/mikujuxu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:45:06] <bristleback> aha
[07:45:15] <bristleback> let's change that a little bit, shall we?
[07:46:11] <bristleback> http://jsbin.com/mikujuxu/3/edit
[07:46:12] <ankurk___> Let me ask you guys one question, how do you know so much about jQuery? through a lot of projects?
[07:46:40] <bristleback> divine inspiration
[07:47:00] <ankurk___> bristleback: oh!
[07:49:37] <bristleback> BillCriswell: can you see the change
[07:49:38] <bristleback> ?
[07:50:26] <BillCriswell> ankurk___: I think I learned mostly from helping people in here.
[07:50:57] <ankurk___> BillCriswell: But still you need some experience for that right?
[07:51:14] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Use .filter() like I said. =)
[07:51:25] <BillCriswell> bristleback: http://jsbin.com/mikujuxu/5/edit
[07:51:33] <bristleback> ain't working either
[07:51:55] <BillCriswell> My demo isn't working or your code isn't working?
[07:52:08] <BillCriswell> Can't say things like "ain't/not working".
[07:53:10] <bristleback> I was referring to my code
[07:53:22] <bristleback> let's what's wrong with it
[07:53:35] <bristleback> i only spotted a single difference
[07:54:41] <BillCriswell> I bet that's the problem. =p
[07:55:02] <BillCriswell> ankurk___: Yeah, but reading and everything else helps a whole lot.
[07:55:55] <BillCriswell> Doing things at a comfortable pace is really nice. The thing you're working on is pretty intense for someone not really familiar with Javascript.
[07:56:06] <decx> i learn the most when i have an idea for something that i have no idea how to realize
[07:56:11] <ankurk___> BillCriswell: Any resources you would recommend apart from official jQuery Docs?
[07:56:18] <ankurk___> yeah it's pretty intense for me
[07:56:29] <ankurk___> I was literally banging my head on the wall
[07:56:49] <ankurk___> I do know basic Javascript but need to brush up concepts more.
[07:56:59] <decx> i still don't really get the sort() function ;)
[07:58:40] <ankurk___> decx: lol, me too
[07:58:55] <BillCriswell> I know how to use sort, but as for how it works internally I never really understood how to approach it. I sat there one night with like .sort(function(a,b){ console.log(a,b); return a < b; }); to see if I could follow.
[07:59:06] <anli> I want to prompt for an image, getting a base64 string of the image, is that possible?
[07:59:10] <anli> No server involved
[07:59:13] <decx> yeah i know how to apply it, but i don't get it
[07:59:35] <decx> some day ^^
[07:59:36] <Blue_Hat> Hi everybody...
[07:59:41] <xKraty> ankurk___: i got called back right after i wrote you lol
[07:59:43] <decx> hello dr. nick
[07:59:43] <Blue_Hat> need some assistance...
[07:59:56] <BillCriswell> anli: You can use canvas maybe.
[08:00:06] <anli> I dont even need to render it
[08:00:20] <anli> But ok
[08:00:32] <ankurk___> xKraty: Damn, Bosses.
[08:00:37] <Blue_Hat> Hey BillCriswell - what's up?
[08:00:40] <BillCriswell> anli: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15685698/getting-binary-base64-data-from-html5-canvas-readasbinarystring
[08:00:42] <xKraty> i m gonna shoot myself
[08:00:49] <ankurk___> xKraty: why?
[08:01:13] <anli> But then I need to prompt for an image that should go in a canvas
[08:01:13] <decx> anli http://jsfiddle.net/handtrix/YvQ5y/
[08:01:32] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm not sure we really need to worry about how it works at that level. Some nerds figured that out ages ago haha.
[08:01:56] <decx> true, but it feels like black magic when i use it
[08:02:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed, don't typically like that feeling.
[08:03:09] <ankurk___> I am loving IRCCloud.
[08:03:19] <shoky> sort just uses any ol' comparison-based sort (e.g. quicksort algorithm) using your sort callback as the comparison function
[08:03:49] <ankurk___> shoky: Funny thing is my boss was clueless about sort too :p
[08:03:52] <decx> i know some of these words
[08:04:51] <ankurk___> decx: it went over my head though
[08:04:57] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha. I looked at a gif of how it works once... that helps, but as for how to implement it I'm not sure. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif
[08:06:03] <shoky> looking at a gif is not gonna get you far
[08:06:11] <BillCriswell> Divide and conquer and all that jazz.
[08:06:15] <BillCriswell> shoky: Oh I know.
[08:06:38] <BillCriswell> It helped me visualize what I was reading.
[08:07:07] <shoky> if you could pause it and step through it'd be much more useful
[08:07:12] <ankurk___> Even though I am a intern, my boss expects a lot from me, I don't know why.
[08:07:32] <BillCriswell> Is your boss a developer?
[08:07:54] <shoky> but yeah every step there with an arrow between 2 elements is a comparison between those 2 elements, so it just calls the comparison function you provide, for those 2 elements in the array
[08:08:03] <decx> mmmmmmh... free work
[08:10:07] <BillCriswell> shoky: I'm probably overthinking the shit out of the whole thing.
[08:10:13] <ankurk___> BillCriswell: He is a developer
[08:10:37] <ankurk___> But a developer who refers to W3Schools a lot.
[08:10:40] <shoky> BillCriswell yup probably
[08:10:44] <ankurk___> I hate W3Schools.
[08:10:55] <BillCriswell> ankurk___: Hmmm... maybe he just wants to break you in! If he wasn't a developer I'd say ignorance.
[08:11:06] <BillCriswell> shoky: :)
[08:11:30] <ankurk___> BillCriswell: I don't know, this one has been a quite an experience for me.
[08:12:16] <xKraty> ankurk___: a developer that doesn't let you use a well made plugin lol, you'd have finish a week ago yet
[08:12:52] <decx> makes sense now though, he's just checking how you solve problems
[08:12:59] <ankurk___> xKraty: He hates JavaScript.
[08:13:26] <xKraty> ankurk___: yeah that's why he made you write loads lol
[08:13:42] <ankurk___> I am not even an expert man
[08:14:16] <Uhkis> how can someone hate JS in 2014
[08:14:25] <ankurk___> I do think how would I solves certain issues but sometimes I go blank
[08:14:30] <xKraty> wait it's 2014 already?
[08:14:32] <ankurk___> Uhkis: Ask my boss.
[08:14:58] <Uhkis> ankurk___: i bet he has some trauma from 10 years ago
[08:15:39] <xKraty> you should fight a trauma with another trauma, punch his head
[08:16:51] <ankurk___> lol I don't want to since I am just an intern
[08:18:23] <Uhkis> ankurk___: you're actually lucky that your boss expects a lot, you could be a coffee maker.. :p
[08:18:37] <decx> i have an easy solution to sort a table without a jquery plugin
[08:18:45] <ankurk___> hahaha! I could have been yeah :P
[08:18:47] <decx> install a sort all tables browser extension ;)
[08:19:05] <ankurk___> decx: lmao
[08:19:09] <ankurk___> he would find out
[08:19:10] <xKraty_> Uhkis: i'd prefer to make coffee for that crappy amount of money we get in italy :\
[08:19:23] <ankurk___> xKraty: how much do you get?
[08:19:34] <ankurk___> If you don't mind telling
[08:19:51] <xKraty_> meh
[08:19:56] <xKraty_> just around 1.100 €
[08:20:16] <xKraty_> dunno where you from but here we are underpaid :\
[08:20:45] <Uhkis> xKraty_: that's internship salary?!
[08:21:11] <xKraty_> yeah
[08:21:18] <ankurk___> I am paid 12$ an hour but Govt takes away $2 :/
[08:21:24] <xKraty_> no wait
[08:21:36] <Uhkis> xKraty_: interns here in finland get like 700€ max (usually 0)
[08:21:41] <Uhkis> so stop whining :D
[08:21:49] <xKraty_> no no it's not internship
[08:22:12] <xKraty_> google says 'open-ended contract'
[08:22:32] <ankurk___> xKraty: you work for Google? :O
[08:22:41] <Uhkis> well then it sounds very low
[08:22:42] <xKraty_> google translate lol
[08:22:48] <ankurk___> oh
[08:23:31] <xKraty_> i thought internship was meant as employee full time
[08:23:45] <xKraty_> i work here since 6 years
[08:23:50] <ankurk___> Nah, it's a part of education in Canada.
[08:24:08] <xKraty_> ankurk___: you from canada?
[08:24:28] <ankurk___> xKraty: I study in Canada as an International Student but I am from India.
[08:24:38] <xKraty_> oh crap
[08:24:49] <xKraty_> i d have ask you if you had a sister to marry lol
[08:25:05] <ankurk___> I have a younger brother :P
[08:25:10] <ankurk___> lol
[08:25:13] <xKraty_> mmm no thanks
[08:25:15] <xKraty_> too young :P
[08:25:18] <ankurk___> you want to come to Canada?
[08:25:37] <ankurk___> don't come here, it's too cold here man
[08:25:42] <xKraty_> AFAIK Canada is one of the best country
[08:25:49] <xKraty_> i live close to mountains i'm fine
[08:25:53] <ankurk___> But Winters are brutal.
[08:26:03] <ankurk___> Lowest I have seen this Winter is -35
[08:26:16] <xKraty_> erm ok maybe not so cold here lol
[08:26:29] <xKraty_> -20 the lowest we had last year
[08:26:43] <Uhkis> we hardly got any winter here in finland, i think lowest here was -26
[08:26:56] <ankurk___> -26 is a lot man
[08:27:06] <xKraty_> i thoguht you live in igloo there lol
[08:27:15] <decx> we had -5°c for a week the whole winter, now it's back to +10°
[08:27:25] <ankurk___> I am so desperately waiting for Spring
[08:27:37] <decx> 14°c even
[08:27:37] <ankurk___> decx: I envy you
[08:27:44] <Uhkis> decx: yeah.. that -20ish only lasted 2 weeks or something
[08:27:57] <decx> germany is now in the mild tropical zone ;)
[08:28:02] <Tingle2> is there a reason $('.user-messages-index-list').scroll(function(){}); works but $(document.body).on('scroll',  '.user-messages-index-list', function (event) {}); doesnt?
[08:28:08] <Uhkis> now it's t-shirt weather (+2ish)
[08:28:13] <xKraty_> usually here its not so cold as in german for decx
[08:28:33] <ankurk___> decx is making me jealous.
[08:29:17] <Tingle2> i need to use the second variant due to my page being a single page with dynamic loaded content
[08:29:32] <xKraty_> i know many developer from italy moves to german/england
[08:29:38] <Uhkis> Tingle2: try without the .body
[08:29:39] <Tingle2> jquery docs say on 'scroll' should work
[08:29:42] <xKraty_> good salary and better work place
[08:30:09] <Tingle2> Uhkis: doesnt work
[08:30:22] <BillCriswell> Tingle2: scroll events don't bubble.
[08:30:30] <ankurk___> xKraty: I think US is much better
[08:30:30] <decx> not where i live xKraty_ had the same money as you when i worked full time, so i went freelance, now i get the same with 10-20h a week
[08:30:54] <Tingle2> BillCriswell: docs say on 'scroll' should work, and .scroll works
[08:31:03] <ankurk___> decx: How did you start freelancing? I have been thinking to switch to freelance too.
[08:31:04] <xKraty_> decx: i could work 2 weeks a month for you lol and chill rest of month
[08:31:20] <decx> no big secret, just have clients that pay
[08:31:26] <decx> that's basicly it
[08:31:27] <xKraty_> lol
[08:31:28] <decx> ;)
[08:31:36] <ankurk___> But you do have to find clients no?
[08:31:36] <xKraty_> just find clients that pay
[08:31:38] <BillCriswell> Tingle2: Yeah, but the scroll event isn't making it to the document to tell if the scroll event originated on .user-messages-index-list
[08:31:44] <Tingle2> mm or it doesnt bubble all the way up to the document.body
[08:31:50] <xKraty_> ankurk___: he prolly bought it on ebay
[08:31:57] <BillCriswell> $('.user-messages-index-list').on('scroll', foo); would work, though.
[08:31:59] <ankurk___> lol
[08:32:06] <Tingle2> yes that does
[08:32:31] <Tingle2> guess I have to readd the event listener when the page section gets reloaded -_-
[08:35:33] <ankurk___> On a side note, you guys should try IRCCloud.
[08:35:47] <xKraty> decx: how long have you been freelancer
[08:36:05] <decx> couple of years
[08:36:18] <xKraty> ankurk___: i like my limechat :O
[08:36:31] <decx> i paid for mirc like 50 years ago so now i'm sticking with it
[08:37:07] <Uhkis> screened irssi ftw :)
[08:37:08] <ankurk___> IRCCloud is like $5 / month
[08:37:20] <farn5w0rth> i'm having issues using an each method with a jquery plugin: i have populated a dataTables table and am iterating through each value and adding a button as the value and i want to open up another dataTable within a modal and display new data, however only the first button to open the modal works?
[08:37:34] <Uhkis> ankurk___: you can get a whole vps for that money
[08:37:59] <xKraty> lol @Uhkis
[08:38:17] <Uhkis> xKraty: what?
[08:38:20] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: ankurk___ is the one that best know datatables
[08:38:25] <xKraty> the vps thing
[08:38:34] <farn5w0rth> ankurk___: :)
[08:38:35] <Uhkis> xKraty: but what's funny
[08:38:48] <xKraty> your comparison ._.
[08:39:27] <ankurk___> Uhkis: But the best thing I like about IRCCloud, I could access it from any where all channels are synced
[08:39:44] <Uhkis> ankurk___: so just like screened irssi
[08:39:55] <ankurk___> yeah like that
[08:40:28] <ankurk___> farn5w0rth: Event delegation man, I think you are doing almost the same thing as me
[08:41:08] <farn5w0rth> ankurk___: oh ya? what are you trying to do?
[08:41:17] <Uhkis> ankurk___: but why would one pay $5 for just irc when you can get a whole vps for the same money :)
[08:41:32] <ankurk___> Uhkis: you're right too though
[08:41:45] <xKraty> ankurk___: would pay that!
[08:42:12] <v2zz> hi! i'm trying to use j.post().done().fail().always(), get valid json, send header Content-type: application/json, but get only fail+always functions triggered. anybody aware of what might be a reason?
[08:42:16] <v2zz> when i check jqxhr object - it's filled with my json data, readyState= 4. all seems fine
[08:44:01] <ankurk___> farn5w0rth: Except for the part I am not using any plugins
[08:44:39] <ankurk___> I am populating a table from PHP, and each row has Edit and Commit button, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/23/edit
[08:44:57] <shoky> v2zz what's the error text argument, in the fail callback?
[08:45:12] <ankurk___> xKraty: Though he has me thinking today, I might cancel my subscription and get a VPS instead :P
[08:45:58] <xKraty> ankurk___: i'm pretty sure you can get many other things with that money
[08:46:16] <xKraty> ankurk___: but hell you work in canada and all know that who works in canada is rich!
[08:46:44] <ankurk___> xKraty: I am not rich man :P I have a lot of bills to pay :P
[08:46:53] <v2zz> shoky have no idea. how can i check?
[08:47:02] <xKraty> ankurk___: no? you got an IRCCloud subscription :p
[08:47:19] <shoky> v2zz:  console.log the 2nd and 3rd arguments to the fail callback
[08:47:27] <ankurk___> huge credit card bills man :P
[08:47:32] <farn5w0rth> ankurk___: the plugin I'm using is just a modal (boot box.js)
[08:47:50] <ankurk___> For modals I am using jQuery UI though
[08:47:59] <farn5w0rth> link?
[08:48:26] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: you sure you don't repeat IDs ?
[08:48:47] <xKraty> bootbox should be fine
[08:48:50] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: definitely - they're pretty unique
[08:49:09] <xKraty> are you able to build a fiddler?
[08:49:14] <ankurk___> Haven't heard of Bootbox.
[08:49:18] <xKraty> to reproduce the issue
[08:49:35] <xKraty> ankurk___: used once with jquery fullcalendar it's well done
[08:49:58] <v2zz> shoky thanx, he's unhappy with json format
[08:49:59] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: the data is coming from secure ajax calls but let me try building something
[08:50:03] <ankurk___> I would definitely try it sometime
[08:50:09] <Tingle2> im trying to find the max scroll height of the element, using .height() returns 638 but .scrollTop() returns 160 when I reach the bottom, so that cant be correct...
[08:50:20] <xKraty> last one i tried is vex one
[08:50:24] <bristleback> BillCriswell: the example you built is working indeed
[08:50:36] <xKraty> http://github.hubspot.com/vex/docs/welcome/
[08:50:39] <Tingle2> nvm I understand why
[08:50:54] <Tingle2> but is there a way to get the max scroll length
[08:50:59] <bristleback> BillCriswell: but I have changed to look similar to what I have: http://jsbin.com/mikujuxu/10/edit
[08:51:04] <bristleback> now is not working anymore
[08:51:17] <zumba_addict> hi folks, how do I capture the language of my browser? I also would like to setup an event that in case the user changes the language, I would call a function
[08:51:51] <xKraty> Tingle2: scrollTop Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the vertical position of the scroll bar for every matched element.
[08:52:03] <Tingle2> mm got it: $(this)[0].scrollHeight - $(this)[0].clientHeight
[08:52:04] <shoky> Tingle2 .prop('scrollHeight')
[08:52:07] <Uhkis> xKraty: i so hate those modal windows which have a titlebar but are not draggable
[08:52:08] <Tingle2> returns the max scroll height
[08:52:09] <Aquaguy> Hello there
[08:52:30] <bristleback> any idea on how to make this work: http://jsbin.com/mikujuxu/11/edit
[08:52:31] <bristleback> ?
[08:52:50] <xKraty> Uhkis: i'm trying to not use modal anymore for not having mobile troubles
[08:53:10] <xKraty> so far best modal i used it's http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[08:54:18] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: looks nice - any experience using dataTables within this?
[08:54:45] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: never used dataTables at all, when i needed it there wasnt yet :\
[08:55:08] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: you sure all buttons are binded?
[08:55:12] <farn5w0rth> dataTables are dope :) but I'm sad it doesn't work
[08:55:19] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: yea they are
[08:55:33] <Aquaguy> Is there a way to not let a draggable element go to negative possitions? I've done: img.draggable({drag: function(e, ui){ if(ui.position.top < 0 || ui.position.left < 0) return false; }}); but when It reaches a negative position it does stop the dragging, but I can't drag the image anymore, I don't want to destroy the dragging but not allow dragging from certain point.
[08:55:49] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: if you just put a console.log on every button instead of your function do it log?
[08:56:04] <farn5w0rth> no only one logs
[08:56:17] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: so the bind is not right :P
[08:56:30] <farn5w0rth> hmm
[08:56:42] <xKraty> Aquaguy: you can use a container and restrict the dragging to that
[08:57:17] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: if your buttons doesnt execute the log than it's not datatable issue but button one
[08:57:39] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: i'm pretty sure if you can get all buttons working with 1 instruction it works
[08:57:40] <Aquaguy> xKraty, I can't use that, I'm zomming the image inside a container of a fixed size, so the image overflows the container, but I don't want to allow dragging the image so the container's background is visible
[08:58:48] <xKraty> Aquaguy: but how you get negative position top left corner should be 0 0
[08:59:02] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: I'm going to try without button and see what happens
[08:59:26] <xKraty> farn5w0rth: good luck i'm off work now!
[09:03:24] <farn5w0rth> xKraty: thanks :)
[09:03:31] <Aquaguy> xKraty: If the container is 200x200 and the image contained inside this container is 400x400 you can get negative positions. Anyway, if you don't know how to do it, thank you so much for your help
[09:04:28] <mdev> for your benefit probably, what's the error?
[09:04:44] <mdev> er I was stuck in major scrollback, ignore that
[09:06:45] <KingThor> howdy, anyone familiar with "Page Scroll to ID" by Malihu?
[09:07:55] <KingThor> trying to work out if it's possible to have a horizontal web page scroll to a shared class, instead of a specific ID
[09:10:00] <KingThor> not looking for a handout, just some clarity :)
[09:10:14] <BillCriswell> KingThor: It would be totall possible.
[09:10:18] <BillCriswell> totally*
[09:10:50] <KingThor> BillCriswell: thank you
[09:11:19] <BillCriswell> KingThor: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/ might interest you depending on how much scrolling has to happen.
[09:11:26] <BillCriswell> You could scroll to anything you can get the position of.
[09:11:53] <KingThor> BillCriswell: Flesler offers options for everything but a relative class
[09:12:20] <BillCriswell> Can you clarify what you mean by relative class?
[09:12:50] <KingThor> shared class, or all elements with class "snap"
[09:13:13] <Crucials> okay im going crazy
[09:13:16] <BillCriswell> So just a specific .snap?
[09:13:31] <KingThor> right, which I guess is what he calls "relative selector"
[09:13:39] <Crucials> I want to animate a div with css transition by changing its CSS with jquery
[09:13:51] <BillCriswell> You could use .eq for that, var $snaps.eq(1),  $snaps.eq(2), etc
[09:13:53] <siepet> if my jquery appends a lot of divs with same class, how can i make diffrent onClick functions for each one of them?
[09:14:11] <Crucials> and its just ignoring the transition, and changing to the 'final' css instantly
[09:14:18] <BillCriswell> siepet: What needs to be done onclick?
[09:15:00] <BillCriswell> Crucials: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ might interest you.
[09:15:04] <acidjazz> siepet: either loop through a class selector or use something else to identify them
[09:15:19] <siepet> i have an array of urls, and clicking first div should load url[0], clicking 2nd url[1] and so on
[09:15:36] <BillCriswell> siepet: You could grab the index of the clicked div.
[09:15:46] <decx> abstract a single onclick function instead of setting multiple ones
[09:16:05] <BillCriswell> $('li').on('click', function(){ var idx = $(this).index(); console.log(url[idx]); });
[09:16:10] <KingThor> BillCriswell: thanks, could you group $snaps.eq(1,2,3,4,5,6,7….)
[09:16:25] <siepet> BillCriswell: thank you! i think that's what i needed!
[09:16:26] <Crucials> kinda, BillCriswell, but it should just be simple to do it without an extra plugin
[09:16:42] <BillCriswell> KingThor: You can't scroll to all of them at once? Not sure I'm following.
[09:17:11] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Do you only want to use css transitions?
[09:17:38] <BillCriswell> Or are you trying to fallback to jQuery animations where there's no CSS transition support?
[09:17:50] <Crucials> only css
[09:18:01] <BillCriswell> Why are you using jQuery at all then?
[09:18:20] <KingThor> BillCriswell: i guess that's what i'm struggling with. how do you denote next eq element, in order to allow prev/next buttons to course through each instance?
[09:18:25] <Crucials> I use jquery to create the div, and want it to automaticall start animating
[09:19:14] <siepet> Okay, it works like i wanted it to, thanks again Bill
[09:19:21] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Do you have a demo so I don't have to make one from scratch?
[09:19:28] <Crucials> yeah sec
[09:20:10] <BillCriswell> KingThor: Just keep a variable that's a number, and when a button is clicked add or subtract one from that number then .scrollTo($scroll.eq(variableNumber))
[09:20:47] <KingThor> BillCriswell: essentials
[09:20:52] <KingThor> I owe you a beer
[09:21:17] <BillCriswell> KingThor: No problem!
[09:21:38] <BillCriswell> KingThor: You'll have to make sure it doesn't go below 0 or the length of $scraps, though.
[09:21:46] <Crucials> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FTx/
[09:22:09] <Crucials> maybe im making an obvious mistake, but i can't see it D:
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> it's usually an obvious mistake - we just have to step away from the tree to see the forest.
[09:23:12] <Crucials> i tried to set away from the tree but hit my head on a branch
[09:23:18] <Crucials> now i have a headache and code that doesnt work
[09:24:17] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:24:48] <BillCriswell> Crucials: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FTx/1/
[09:24:51] <decx> does appendto work in a var?
[09:24:59] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[09:25:05] <duch_kazatel> any jquery object.
[09:25:30] <decx> well it does the appendto but that's not what you really want in a var is it
[09:25:37] <duch_kazatel> not in that case.
[09:25:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell's version is the "right" way.
[09:26:18] <Crucials> hm, was the issue that i tried to animate it instantly?
[09:26:21] <decx> ye , var bubble = $('<div class="bubble"></div>').appendTo('#wrap'); is the same as $('<div class="bubble"></div>').appendTo('#wrap');
[09:26:47] <decx> but what happens if you call bubble
[09:26:58] <duch_kazatel> bubble is the entire new node.
[09:27:02] <duch_kazatel> for #wrap
[09:27:25] <decx> yep, console.log(bubble) is the bubble div
[09:27:37] <duch_kazatel> wait just the bubble div?  and not #wrap?
[09:27:44] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[09:28:00] <decx> yeah the var ignores the appendTo function
[09:28:02] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Yeah, that is weird.
[09:28:17] <duch_kazatel> that's backwares - it should evaluate the whole line and get the return.
[09:28:24] <BillCriswell> Crucials: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FTx/2/ in timeout it works, without it it doesn't.
[09:28:35] <Crucials> its retarded proof for people like me, duch_kazatel
[09:28:39] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ says the returns are the sets.
[09:28:39] <Crucials> retard*
[09:29:11] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(function(){ $bubble.addClass('animate') }, 0); This works, but $bubble.addClass('animate') doesn't
[09:29:15] <Crucials> oh wow BillCriswell, even if the settimeout is 0
[09:30:15] <Crucials> that seems strange
[09:30:20] <BillCriswell> Crucials: I ran into a similar thing where I was doing like $el.addClass('right'); and the element would still animate from the left. I had to do like $el.position().left to get the browser to update where it was.
[09:30:36] <BillCriswell> or put it in the setTimeout.
[09:30:53] <BillCriswell> We like to think things happen line by line but it doesn't always seem to be the case.
[09:31:11] <BillCriswell> Well, at least at the level we're working haha.
[09:31:40] <decx> why not use a keyframe animation?
[09:31:43] <Crucials> hm. what does declaring a var with a $ change?
[09:31:57] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Nothing. I just do it for clarity.
[09:32:14] <BillCriswell> decx: I dunno?
[09:32:20] <Crucials> I just saw it done before and figured theres a reason
[09:32:20] <BillCriswell> It was a while ago.
[09:32:33] <duch_kazatel> decx this is why I'm confused about the appendTo() var assignment deal: http://jsfiddle.net/4uaje/1/
[09:32:41] <BillCriswell> Crucials: i see $ at the start I assume it's a jQuery variable.
[09:32:53] <duch_kazatel> the var assignment should be equal to the result of the evaluation.
[09:33:10] <decx> yeah it's strange
[09:33:37] <Crucials> that yellow hurt my eyes btw BillCriswell
[09:33:44] <Crucials> but thanks a lot for the help :D
[09:34:31] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Yellow King.
[09:34:54] <BillCriswell> I can't wait for Sunday.
[09:35:18] <BillCriswell> True Detective is... amazing.
[09:35:43] <Crucials> ive heard mixed things about it
[09:36:48] <BillCriswell> I really dig it.
[09:37:07] <TrentonDAdams> For the datepicker, is it possible to force current date selection onClose?  Let's say the person picked a day/month, but forgot the year.  They come back in, change just the year, and close the control.  I want the date in the input field updated to reflect the year.
[09:38:02] <decx> is mdn down?
[09:39:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Seems so.
[09:39:52] <decx> the landing page still works, but the content pages don'T
[09:40:46] <BillCriswell> decx: I've been using devdocs.io
[09:40:52] <BillCriswell> Really liking that.
[09:41:37] <decx> sweet baby jesus that's amazing
[09:41:53] <decx> livesearch for methods in multiple apis? bookmarked
[09:42:28] <BillCriswell> It's my home page. That's like the biggest honor a webpage can receive.
[09:43:06] <BillCriswell> Not MY home page specifically, but just being someones homepage is serious business.
[09:43:18] <Crucials> oh noooo billlllll
[09:43:21] <Crucials> new problems :(
[09:43:27] <decx> i dont actually have a homepage
[09:43:51] <decx> it'S all porn tabs when i open the browser
[09:44:08] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:44:26] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Uh oh
[09:44:47] <birgnow> How can i get the difference in hours and minutes in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/dzAya/31/
[09:44:56] <Crucials> basically im trying to create multiple of these bubbles at the same time BillCriswell
[09:45:05] <Crucials> but they dont all seem to get the animate class properly
[09:46:00] <birgnow> lets say i have 3:30 am and 1:00 am i need the difference as 2,3
[09:46:03] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Need a fiddle.
[09:46:34] <BillCriswell> birgnow: Subtraction.
[09:46:36] <decx> if you want to animate multiple elements i'd go with canvas instead of dom fiddling
[09:46:50] <Crucials> Uh, i fixed it BillCriswell, i think
[09:46:52] <birgnow> BillCriswell:  thats what i was trying to do
[09:46:53] <Crucials> but maybe theres a better way
[09:47:22] <Crucials> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FTx/4/
[09:47:51] <siepet> has anyone worked on chrome extension?
[09:48:04] <birgnow> shoul i use parseFloat
[09:48:05] <birgnow> ?
[09:48:50] <Crucials> for about 2 hours once siepet, i was trying to make an "asianify" button, that replaced all 'L's with 'R's
[09:48:54] <Crucials> ended up breaking all the html
[09:49:08] <BillCriswell> birgnow: What your using is working, but you just have to subtract the lower from the higher.
[09:49:12] <decx> lol
[09:49:13] <BillCriswell> you're*
[09:49:25] <Crucials> <stlonk>broked :(<stlonk>
[09:49:39] <Crucials> g*
[09:49:57] <birgnow> BillCriswell:  if you select 3.40 and 12:00 you will get 3
[09:50:11] <birgnow> not 3,4
[09:50:18] <lianzinho> guys, any clues on why this snippet is not submitting the form neither writing to the console? --> http://jsfiddle.net/5yUx3/
[09:50:26] <siepet> i'm working on some now, and it works on my localhost, but it doesn't work after adding to chrome and i've loaded all scripts in index.html and in manifest and not sure whats wrong
[09:51:39] <BillCriswell> bitdestroyer: http://jsfiddle.net/dzAya/31/
[09:51:58] <BillCriswell> bitdestroyer: I didn't notice you mad minutes in your times.
[09:52:07] <BillCriswell> If you want that to it'll get a little more tricky.
[09:53:14] <bitdestroyer> BillCriswell: Mean to send that to birgnow?
[09:53:17] <hooligan133> wow
[09:53:21] <BillCriswell> Yes, sorry.
[09:53:27] <bitdestroyer> Haha, no problem
[09:53:30] <BillCriswell> birgnow: *
[09:53:41] <birgnow> let me check
[09:53:48] <hooligan133> just added some code to my global style sheet that had a unclosed comment
[09:53:58] <hooligan133> had me scratching my head saying oh shit oh shit oh shit
[09:54:09] <BillCriswell> hooligan133: Nerve wrecking when that hapens.
[09:54:35] <birgnow> BillCriswell:  is it much more tricky?
[09:54:45] <birgnow> to get it work like that
[09:54:45] <birgnow> ?
[09:54:51] <BillCriswell> birgnow: Nope, just a bit.
[09:55:09] <birgnow> ew =/
[09:56:02] <lianzinho> are there any problem using .submit inside a click event with a handler?
[09:56:10] <lianzinho> .submit(), I mean
[09:59:02] <BillCriswell> birgnow: If you're going to be working with a lot of dates and shit you should look into Moment.js
[10:00:03] <birgnow> will do that
[10:01:35] <BillCriswell> birgnow: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/ in particular.
[10:03:00] <birgnow> thanks
[10:10:32] <Crucials> any other fancy things to add to the bubbles? http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FTx/7/
[10:10:42] <Crucials> (might only work on chrome)
[10:13:14] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Can I suggest something?
[10:13:23] <Crucials> yea :D
[10:14:11] <BillCriswell> Crucials: Don't create so many, since then fade out you can reuse them. I imagine this demo gets really overloaded after a while.
[10:14:22] <BillCriswell> don't create so many bubbles*
[10:14:29] <decx> also use settimeout&requestanimation frame
[10:14:56] <decx> but pretty cool demo nonetheless ^^
[10:15:11] <Crucials> at line 20 i delete the ones that are at 0 opacity
[10:15:13] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed!
[10:15:15] <Crucials> or atleast pretty sure I am
[10:15:37] <decx> yeah but instead of removing them and creating new ones you can just reset their state back to the bottom
[10:15:49] <Crucials> ah
[10:16:14] <Crucials> does that make a big difference in performance? it means I need to reclaculate all the random things anyway
[10:17:52] <Minty__> Hi, has anyone used scroll spy? It's not working properly for me.
[10:23:10] <BillCriswell> birgnow: I can't seem to get hours and minutes from .diff() there, but this would work: http://pastie.org/pastes/8780901/text
[10:25:08] <davearel_> Think we'll ever see amd-like modularity in jQuery production releases? https://tech.bellycard.com/blog/the-future-of-jquery/
[10:25:59] <nhulea_nsa> yo hows it going
[10:27:43] <davearel_> great nhulea_nsa
[10:28:40] <nhulea_nsa> awesome thats great hey you guys know anything about cors ?
[10:28:46] <nhulea_nsa> CORS?
[10:28:57] <duch_kazatel> what about it?
[10:29:01] <gx> i'm trying to figure out if there's a jquery plugin that lets me do "dynamic insertion" on unordered lists, similar to what's seen on the right-hand side of http://bitcoinwisdom.com/ ...anyone know what that might be called?
[10:29:14] <BillCriswell> davearel_: I love modularity till it gets to be a pain in the butt.
[10:29:50] <davearel_> BillCriswell: yep, still not 100%, but it's a fantastic concept that just needs more support
[10:30:10] <nhulea_nsa> hold ons one sec I am working on my fiddle I am trying to use canvas.toDataUrl and I cannot remove this tainted canvas error ??
[10:30:13] <BillCriswell> davearel_: Agreed.
[10:30:39] <davearel_> support from big names like jQuery would help
[10:30:44] <BillCriswell> I think we should have a national "make your documentation awesome" week.
[10:32:14] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: I will support that
[10:37:31] <beta> Hi there !
[10:37:48] <gllvr> is there a way to get the html text for a newly created element?     $('<button>FOO</button>').html()  gives "FOO", but I would like to get back "<button>FOO</button>" some how.
[10:38:13] <BillCriswell> gllvr: You want that as text?
[10:38:38] <beta> I'm using fullcalendar since a quite long time and I've discovered a weird workaround: the calls in a small size (the week view) is working perfectly, but a full-size rendering makes the drag&drop + resize totally messed up
[10:38:56] <gllvr> BillCriswell --  yeah, b/c i am constructing a more complex fragment, programatically, and would like to get it back as text.
[10:38:57] <beta> any tip for that, or any experience of the same behaviour ?
[10:40:17] <BillCriswell> gllvr: You would build on $('<button>FOO</button>') with the usual dom manipulation stuff like .append(), whoudl would apped something inside button and so on.
[10:41:03] <TheEternalAbyss> anyone ever used jquery.cookie plugin?
[10:41:40] <gllvr> yeah, i know how to build the fragment ... i want to get back the html text after i have contracted it.   .html()  gives back only the contents ... it does not give back the html (tag & attributes) of the enclosing node.
[10:41:46] <gllvr> TheEternalAbyss: I have, yeah.
[10:42:01] <mehwork> is there something like jshint but for jquery code? Something that will tell me if i'm not using jquery best practices?
[10:42:32] <BillCriswell> gllvr: Not sure why you'd need to do that, but you could try $('<button>FOO</button>')[0].outerHTML ?
[10:43:10] <gllvr> perfect!  thanks!   I was doing outerHtml, and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.
[10:43:33] <gllvr> HTML, all caps.  doh.
[10:43:43] <TheEternalAbyss> gllvr: cool.. maybe you can answer a question I have.. I have a cookie calle 'css'. to check if the cookie is set, I do this:    if($.cookie("css")){ //do stuff }    is that correct?
[10:44:03] <BillCriswell> gllvr: Yeah, that's no fun.
[10:44:33] <Minty__> has anyone used scrollspy? i'm having trouble with it
[10:44:34] <gllvr> yeah.  that will give you back the value of the coolie, assuming it is available to the page.
[10:44:34] <TheEternalAbyss> cause when I load my page it does seem to retain what I put in the cookie
[10:44:36] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: are you around?
[10:44:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm kicking around.
[10:44:57] <duch_kazatel> ish
[10:44:57] <gllvr> does or does not?
[10:45:39] <TheEternalAbyss> ok, I then creat a link using the cookie like     $("link").attr("href", $.cookie("css"));
[10:45:46] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i was wondering if you'd used scroll spy? i'm not sure i'm using it incorrectly but the function it provides hardly ever fires
[10:46:03] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: my understanding was that i would be able to fire a function every time a user finished a scroll, i.e. onLeave but it hardly ever fires
[10:46:12] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: not sure if that is due to my min/max settings but it's odd
[10:46:19] <TheEternalAbyss> so it loads the stored info. but when I load my page I see no css loaded as I would expect
[10:46:21] <TheEternalAbyss> why is that?
[10:46:23] <duch_kazatel> I've used it once or twice.  it's smart in that it fires only when the "active section" changes.
[10:46:45] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: what is the active section?
[10:46:59] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: because i have a feeling that it thinks the active section is always body and so it hardly ever fires
[10:47:05] <duch_kazatel> Minty_ so you know how you were hotlinking to particular sections of the page?
[10:47:10] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i printed the id and it was undefined - that would be a non-id tag like body
[10:47:13] <duch_kazatel> and it would scroll there?
[10:47:21] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yea
[10:47:27] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: but i don't think scrollspy reads that correctly
[10:47:39] <duch_kazatel> then you're not using it right.
[10:47:43] <gllvr> what happens if you do $.cookie('css') in the console?
[10:47:48] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: thought so!
[10:47:54] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it?
[10:47:55] <TheEternalAbyss> let me see gllvr. standby
[10:48:46] <TheEternalAbyss> says $.cookie is not a function...
[10:48:50] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: can't because fiddle doesn't know what scroll spy is
[10:49:01] <gllvr> ah.  then jquery.cookie has not loaded properly.
[10:49:03] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ ... that's why you set it as an external resource.
[10:49:06] <gllvr> thats your issue.
[10:49:10] <gllvr> presumably.
[10:49:16] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: how do i do that? <script> ?
[10:49:35] <TheEternalAbyss> that's strange, It's included in index
[10:49:36] <gllvr> are you using require.js , or just a sequence of <script> tags in your page?
[10:49:50] <TheEternalAbyss> Scrip ttags
[10:49:51] <duch_kazatel> Minty http://i.imgur.com/zWFTYwU.png
[10:49:59] <TheEternalAbyss> script tags*
[10:50:04] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: thanks, will setup now
[10:50:12] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ pop this link in there: https://raw.github.com/sxalexander/jquery-scrollspy/master/jquery-scrollspy.js
[10:50:34] <gllvr> you could try putting <script>debugger</script> in the page, to confirm things are loading in as you expect.
[10:51:08] <TheEternalAbyss> just <script>debugger</script> ? ok
[10:51:12] <gllvr> you should also be able to see, in the network console, the js files being pulled in.  you want to make sure they are all loading successfully.
[10:51:19] <gllvr> yeah, i think that should work.
[10:51:38] <gllvr> put it before and after the jquery.coookie script tag.
[10:51:38] <TheEternalAbyss> i see the file loaded it net tab
[10:51:45] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:51:49] <TheEternalAbyss> kk
[10:52:04] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/ open your console, it will log whenever scroll spy fires which is hardly ever
[10:52:31] <gllvr> then you can check, before and after, to see if $.cookie is getting defined.
[10:53:13] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: think i included scrollspy wrong, it's throwing an error in that fiddle; Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollspy'
[10:54:09] <andrew9183> does scroll spy depend on query ?
[10:54:12] <andrew9183> *jquery
[10:54:27] <Minty__> yea
[10:57:12] <TheEternalAbyss> it is being loaded
[10:57:51] <gllvr> so you can run $.cookie('css') in the console now ?
[10:58:19] <TheEternalAbyss> no still says not a function. but I see jquery.cookie.ls loaded in the net tab
[10:58:20] <gllvr> the file might be getting loaded, but it might note be adding the cookie() method to the global $ object.
[10:58:47] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: ?
[10:58:50] <gllvr> jquery is getting loaded before jquery.cookie ?
[10:58:55] <TheEternalAbyss> yes
[10:59:19] <TheEternalAbyss> wait..
[11:01:26] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ did you not see me say brb earlier?
[11:01:40] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: oh no, sorry
[11:02:29] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ you're not including jquery on there.
[11:02:44] <TheEternalAbyss> ok...
[11:03:07] <TheEternalAbyss> I have it so it loads now properly. now it's saying $.cookie("css") is undefined
[11:03:19] <TheEternalAbyss> so it's losing the cookie
[11:03:48] <gllvr> so do $.cookie('css', 'foo'); $.cooke('css'), and see if you get back 'foo'
[11:03:49] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: jsfiddle has it built in
[11:03:57] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: surely? it's letting me scroll around
[11:04:14] <TheEternalAbyss> css=foo
[11:04:17] <TheEternalAbyss> yup
[11:04:31] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ no actually, it doesn't.  http://i.imgur.com/CN16XVI.png
[11:04:36] <duch_kazatel> you have to set it.
[11:05:01] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ let me show you the right way to use jsfiddle.
[11:05:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/4/
[11:05:28] <duch_kazatel> there.
[11:05:34] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: still throwing same error
[11:05:36] <Minty__> thanks
[11:05:36] <gllvr> cookie can get "misplaced" if they are set and accessed from different url paths.   I usually do $.cookie('css', 'foo', {path: '/'});  to always set them at the domain root, to make sure that does not happen.
[11:05:49] <duch_kazatel> Minty now it's not throwing an error.
[11:06:01] <gllvr> you might try that, in case that is your issue.  the chrome cooke inspector should let you see what paths your cookies are getting set for.
[11:06:15] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: it is, it can't execute the github file and scroll spy isn't on any cdn
[11:06:20] <TheEternalAbyss> actually when I set it, it's set to '/'
[11:06:38] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.github.com/sxalexander/jquery-scrollspy/master/jquery-scrollspy.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[11:06:38] <TheEternalAbyss> oh... let me try something one moment
[11:06:47] <duch_kazatel> Minty huh?  U'm not getting that at all.
[11:06:56] <duch_kazatel> *I'm
[11:07:01] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: check this out see I get the error Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported.
[11:07:10] <nhulea_nsa> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/Mms37/
[11:07:21] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: ok, well you can probably see the scroll spy error then, see how many times console logs the scroll spy function firigin
[11:07:23] <duch_kazatel> ah, Minty__ you're probably in chrome.
[11:07:27] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yea
[11:07:33] <nhulea_nsa> go ahead and check the console and the headers its seems to be fine but yet I still get tainted canvas ?
[11:07:51] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa sorry working with Minty right now then I have to get back to work =/
[11:08:11] <nhulea_nsa> ok cool I am just stumped on this cors bullshit
[11:09:31] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: don't even look at it in firefox / ie yet, there are other issues there. mousewheel isn't working
[11:10:08] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: in chrome, click works perfectly, mousewheel seems to work fine but i doubt it's bug free yet but key press rarely works and i think its because scroll spy isn't firing properly and so currentSection is not being updated
[11:10:12] <duch_kazatel> christ. https://github.com/thesmart/jquery-scrollspy is the right one.
[11:10:34] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ I apologize - the original repo was not the one I should have linked.
[11:11:14] <BillCriswell> What's the opposite of DRY code?
[11:11:24] <duch_kazatel> WET code?
[11:11:38] <duch_kazatel> (backronym time!)
[11:11:41] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I can't think of good words to go along with that abbreviation.
[11:12:05] <TheEternalAbyss> gllvr: lol ok now the cookie is stuck on being = foo
[11:12:06] <gllvr> "write everything twice"
[11:12:07] <TheEternalAbyss> lmao
[11:12:10] <duch_kazatel> niiiice
[11:12:19] <gllvr> TheEternalAbyss: well done.
[11:12:24] <duch_kazatel> gllvr wins the day
[11:12:44] <BillCriswell> gllvr: There you go.
[11:12:44] <gllvr> ha ha.  you came up with "WET"
[11:13:45] <BillCriswell> I'm working with some CSS and instead og building on styles already defined in "smaller" media queries everything is redefined.
[11:15:11] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[11:15:13] <NoiseEee> sounds like some fun maintenance
[11:15:47] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Yeah. It's rough.
[11:16:46] <TheEternalAbyss> i don't get this.. it still says undefined
[11:17:09] <TheEternalAbyss> the path  "/" where is that, ont he local machine loading the page, right?
[11:18:13] <gllvr> yeah.  thats the "top" of the domain.
[11:18:25] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: If you're trying to work with cookies locally you may run into some headaches.. at least in the past I know I have.
[11:18:30] <gllvr> it sounds like whatever code you have that is creating the cookie is doing it incorrectly
[11:18:44] <TheEternalAbyss> well I don't know if it's local or not
[11:19:11] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/7/
[11:19:13] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: I mean are you working with them on YOUR machine through like a file:/// url.
[11:19:15] <IamTrying> How do i get the value $('.getvalue').span1 , 2 ,3 ?? e.g: <div class=getvalue><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> </div>
[11:19:37] <BillCriswell> IamTrying: $('.getValue').find('span').eq(1)
[11:19:45] <IamTrying> OK - Thanks !! BillCriswell
[11:19:45] <TheEternalAbyss> it's just $.cookie("css",$(this).attr('rel'), {expires: 365, path: '/'});
[11:20:02] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm not doing that BillCriswell
[11:20:11] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Ok. Just making sure.
[11:20:15] <TheEternalAbyss> yup
[11:20:55] <BillCriswell> When I was (attempting) to learn Magento I couldn't login because I was using 127.0.0.1/magento, but if I set up bill.dev/magento it was fine.
[11:21:03] <BillCriswell> Through my hosts file.
[11:22:08] <gllvr> i would trying putting breakpoints or debugger statements right on the cookie set statement, to confirm its running
[11:22:35] <TheEternalAbyss> i know it's running because my styles are changing
[11:22:36] <gllvr> oh ... you also need to pass {path: '/'} when you read the cookie back
[11:22:48] <gllvr> that might be the issue
[11:22:52] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm trying to build a css switcher
[11:22:54] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: sorry someone came over to talk to me, will look at this in firefox now
[11:23:03] <TheEternalAbyss> oh.....yea I'm not doing that am i...
[11:23:53] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: At this rate you might as well use localStorage
[11:24:30] <TheEternalAbyss> i suppose I could
[11:25:01] <BillCriswell> localStorage.setItem('css', 'foo.css'); localStorage.getItem('css')
[11:25:29] <TheEternalAbyss> and that would act like a cookie for the next time the user loads the site?
[11:25:40] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Yup.
[11:25:44] <TheEternalAbyss> nice
[11:25:51] <BillCriswell> IE8+ support.
[11:26:12] <BillCriswell> There's polyfills for IE7 I am sure, but yeah. IE8 should be plenty.
[11:27:32] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: this is so weird, it just doesn't work in my context
[11:28:08] <Minty__> actually i might not have called the function...
[11:29:00] <duch_kazatel> Minty the new version uses a different version of scrollspy, but it demonstrates the basics.
[11:29:07] <duch_kazatel> you need to lean on scrollspy much more than you are.
[11:29:44] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: why doesn't my implementation of what you've done work here; http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/8/
[11:29:50] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: it's pretty much a copy and paste '|
[11:30:45] <TheEternalAbyss> so how do I retrieve the value of localStorage?
[11:30:53] <TheEternalAbyss> getItem returns object object
[11:31:15] <duch_kazatel> Minty you've got too much stuff in there.
[11:31:36] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ also: how in the world do you expect to "exit" from document?
[11:31:42] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ did you even read the docs?
[11:31:44] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i changed that to section
[11:31:50] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yea scroll spy docs are awfully sparse
[11:32:10] <Minty__> i changed to section and now i'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollSpy'
[11:32:13] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/thesmart/jquery-scrollspy
[11:32:39] <duch_kazatel> you're calling scollspy on document.
[11:32:43] <Minty__> oh wow using an older version
[11:32:53] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i updated it
[11:33:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/9/
[11:33:23] <duch_kazatel> $(document).scrollSpy(); is a no-no.
[11:33:24] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: in this new version, how does it know which element you're entering
[11:33:31] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yes i changed that
[11:33:53] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/10/
[11:33:57] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: but function doesn't take any arguments so there is no way of scroll spy knowing exactly which element
[11:34:00] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the element you're entering.
[11:34:08] <duch_kazatel> ^^ look at what I just linked you.
[11:34:12] <duch_kazatel> it knows exactly which element.
[11:34:41] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: thanks
[11:34:53] <duch_kazatel> how much are you familiar with javascript, Minty__?
[11:34:53] <Minty__> this looks a lot better than the version of scrollspy that i was using
[11:35:15] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: started yesterday
[11:35:16] <TheEternalAbyss> seems liek i'm running into the same issue though even with local storage. retrieving it is giving me issues
[11:35:30] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ woah.  you should really start with the basics.
[11:36:05] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ a lot of the questions you're asking/things you're having trouble with are very basic.  it would serve you well to start from the beginning.
[11:36:14] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: what's a good resource? w3schools is shit
[11:36:27] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i come from python though
[11:36:55] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ So did I.
[11:37:05] <duch_kazatel> mdn is a great resource.
[11:38:59] <TheEternalAbyss> anyone?
[11:39:14] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ you're probably not used to the event-centric model of in-browser javascript.
[11:39:48] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yea i'm not
[11:39:49] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Are you running into issues changing styles?
[11:40:05] <BillCriswell> or getting values from localStorage
[11:40:12] <duch_kazatel> Minty__ are you interested in learning javascript long-term?
[11:40:15] <TheEternalAbyss> getting values
[11:40:30] <TheEternalAbyss> same problem as I am getting with the cookies
[11:40:38] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: not sure, perhaps
[11:40:52] <TheEternalAbyss> style changes, I get no errors, on reload of page, it fails to retrieve the correct style
[11:40:56] <TheEternalAbyss> that was last used
[11:42:12] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: why am I getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollspy'
[11:42:17] <duch_kazatel> where?
[11:42:20] <duch_kazatel> (link)
[11:42:24] <Minty__> i wasn't a second ago - i updated the scrollspy file and suddenly, breaks
[11:42:51] <Minty__> ah i'm getting that error in chrome
[11:42:56] <Minty__> i updated the jsfiddle and no problems there
[11:42:59] <Minty__> but on my site, not working
[11:43:02] <duch_kazatel> link.
[11:43:14] <Minty__> [19:42:51.344] TypeError: $(...).scrollspy is not a function @ http://dev.adamcunnington.info/scroll.js:52
[11:43:16] <Minty__> getting that in firefox
[11:43:24] <duch_kazatel> 401
[11:43:26] <Minty__> link here; http://jsfiddle.net/L2HSH/11/
[11:43:29] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[11:43:41] <duch_kazatel> i'm not getting an error.,
[11:43:43] <Minty__> nevermind
[11:43:46] <Minty__> i refreshed and it went
[11:43:48] <Minty__> that was weird
[11:44:00] <duch_kazatel> probably cached the old version.
[11:44:29] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: yea
[11:44:34] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: so the mousewheel doesn't work in firefox or ie
[11:44:56] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: i get no errors except when loading the page; [19:44:02.285] Unknown property 'box-sizing'.  Declaration dropped. @ http://dev.adamcunnington.info/
[11:45:09] <Minty__> but that sounds more like css
[11:45:23] <duch_kazatel> Minty... you have to completely rewrite your code
[11:45:25] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: http://jsfiddle.net/dkQKs/
[11:46:02] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: please no :(
[11:46:04] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: why?
[11:46:04] <BillCriswell> I just went here for the first time, it logged "You were never here", quit my browser out completely, went back and then it showed "You were here before".
[11:46:21] <frank_o> Hi, anybody know of any jQuery tap indicators for mobile? Like when you tap, these "mini shockwaves" appear.
[11:46:32] <Minty__> it works in IE, just not firefox
[11:46:44] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: does firefox not pick up on .on("mousewheel" ?
[11:46:58] <ankurk___> Can a on('click') event contain another on('click') event?
[11:47:12] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: thanks... let me rework my code a bit
[11:47:53] <Minty__> duch_kazatel: thanks for all your help, need to head off to a client meeting now but will be back and testing more later
[11:47:57] <NoiseEee> well something can have more than one handler/listener, ankurk___
[11:48:18] <ankurk___> NoiseEee: so it is possible in another words?
[11:48:33] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: what's the 'HI' for in setItem?
[11:56:00] <Aristona> Hi guys, I have a problem. The script is here: http://laravel.io/bin/MXBO
[11:56:21] <Aristona> It works on normal page load but I use infinite scroll. It does not work on ajax loaded content.
[11:56:38] <duch_kazatel> Aristona look into event delegation.
[11:56:48] <Aristona> I believe I need to use "live", but I already use "on" and I'm on 1.9.1
[11:56:54] <duch_kazatel> don't use live()
[11:57:02] <duch_kazatel> use the delegated syntax for on.
[11:57:09] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Just something random I set.
[11:57:20] <duch_kazatel> Aristona what's the parent container for your content?
[11:58:08] <Aristona> How can I use delegated syntax for on?
[11:58:19] <Aristona> Right now it is $(document).on('ready', function() {
[11:58:22] <duch_kazatel> Aristona i'll show you.   what's the parent container for your content?
[11:58:32] <duch_kazatel> no, not document - what's the div or p or whatever?
[11:58:44] <duch_kazatel> there should be a main content area that stuff is getting loaded into in your html.
[11:59:10] <Aristona> .infinite-scroll
[11:59:24] <duch_kazatel> replace line 5 with $('.infinite-scroll').on('click', '.clickable-gif, .clickable-vine', function(e) {
[11:59:34] <duch_kazatel> also: your doc ready isn't valid any longer.
[11:59:50] <duch_kazatel> use either $( document ).ready( handler ) or $(function() {
[12:00:23] <Aristona> Oh yeah, it works now
[12:00:46] <duch_kazatel> actuually, $(document).ready(function() { or $(function() {
[12:00:51] <duch_kazatel> either way.
[12:01:22] <Aristona> $(function() { }); ?
[12:01:33] <Aristona> or I do need })(jQuery); ?
[12:01:43] <duch_kazatel> nope, just the first one.
[12:01:54] <Aristona> What does the $ mean?
[12:01:59] <Aristona> I mean in front of function
[12:02:05] <duch_kazatel> jquery
[12:02:20] <duch_kazatel> $(function() { }); is shorthand for the doc ready.
[12:02:51] <TheEternalAbyss> kk BillCriswell, but it's the value that getItem would return right?
[12:03:09] <Aristona> okay, thanks alot duch :)
[12:05:41] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: ok it's working... just.... i get my out 5 times in a row for some reason..
[12:05:47] <TheEternalAbyss> output*
[12:06:15] <TheEternalAbyss> no, 6 times..
[12:06:17] <TheEternalAbyss> wtf
[12:06:27] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Are you trying to read it on click or something?
[12:06:33] <TheEternalAbyss> on change
[12:06:48] <TheEternalAbyss> it's selected through a dropdown meu
[12:06:51] <BillCriswell> Are you on the element directly or a parent listening for a change?
[12:07:20] <TheEternalAbyss> parent select listening to option change
[12:08:37] <TheEternalAbyss> the page itself does perform ajax calls and loads data in
[12:08:43] <TheEternalAbyss> could that generate extra outputs?
[12:08:53] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Try putting a return false at the end of the click handler.
[12:10:09] <TheEternalAbyss> no, still css outputs
[12:10:40] <TheEternalAbyss> i mean still six outputs even with return false.
[12:11:43] <BillCriswell> Would need to show the code.
[12:11:56] <TheEternalAbyss> kk, i'll brb and try to show anything if I can
[12:13:58] <guide_X> if I have a $(tr)  which is the tr I am starting from, how do I find the tr above that (which also has a class?) I've tried things like $(tr).parent().closest("tr.myclass") but it's not working...
[12:14:28] <NoiseEee> just $(tr).closest('tr.myclass')
[12:15:52] <BillCriswell> guide_X: .before() I think you actually want.
[12:15:54] <guide_X> hmm weird... that's still not working..
[12:15:57] <guide_X> oh hmm
[12:15:58] <guide_X> i'll try that
[12:16:22] <BillCriswell> I want a bagel... I've never been in the mood for a bagel.
[12:16:35] <guide_X> everything bagels are so good
[12:16:47] <guide_X> I always avoid them because I feel terrible after eating them...
[12:16:58] <guide_X> lately I stopped eating most breads because I found they contain yoga mats
[12:17:33] <BillCriswell> I'm a cinnamon raisin bagel guy myself.
[12:17:35] <frank_o> guide_X: Go for a jog?
[12:17:38] <jwmann> Is it possible to have multiple elements in a .not() method?
[12:17:41] <BillCriswell> With jelly and cream cheese.
[12:17:50] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Yes.
[12:18:00] <jwmann> Awesome
[12:18:03] <BillCriswell> .not('.foo,.bar,.baz')
[12:18:03] <guide_X> frank_o: well yeah, but it just makes me so sleepy after a bagel, they're very heavy
[12:18:15] <jwmann> Thanks! :)
[12:18:17] <BillCriswell> lol jogging
[12:18:22] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:18:29] <frank_o> Yeah bagels are a special breed.
[12:18:32] <TheEternalAbyss> breads contain yoga mats...wait.. what?
[12:19:03] <frank_o> TheEternalAbyss: They feel heavy.
[12:19:12] <NoiseEee> http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-06/business/chi-subway-bread-chemical-20140206_1_bread-subway-chemical
[12:19:13] <TheEternalAbyss> lol ohh
[12:19:17] <guide_X> TheEternalAbyss: I found that some fast food places, like subway and starbucks, are using the same stuff they put in yoga matts in their bread, then I expanded my research, and found that most breads contain "yoga matt" ingredients
[12:19:37] <guide_X> TheEternalAbyss: unfortunetly, I'm becoming one of those natural foods guys
[12:19:38] <TheEternalAbyss> yea... i don't do fast food so..
[12:19:57] <guide_X> TheEternalAbyss: I found most grocery store bought breads also contain yoga matts
[12:20:10] <TheEternalAbyss> i go to an italian bakery to get my bread
[12:20:10] <guide_X> it's absolutely disgusting
[12:20:18] <guide_X> oh maybe you're safe from the yoga matts then..
[12:20:24] <TheEternalAbyss> maybe... lol
[12:20:47] <TheEternalAbyss> my family does by toast bread... i have to see wtf is in there now.. thanks for the paranoia
[12:20:51] * TheEternalAbyss puts on tin foil hat
[12:20:59] <TheEternalAbyss> :P
[12:21:08] <guide_X> there was this gross anti-ad about subway, and showed a subway sandwitch wrapped up in a yoga matt instead of bread lol...
[12:21:32] <TheEternalAbyss> lmao
[12:21:35] <guide_X> TheEternalAbyss: I'm sorry.. I guess I should stop killing peoples lack of knowledge
[12:21:48] <guide_X> ignorance is bliss... (I miss subway lol)
[12:21:48] <TheEternalAbyss> nah I like knowledge
[12:23:26] <guide_X> hmm I think before inserts right?
[12:23:33] <guide_X> I'm looking to find and update..
[12:26:07] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Hm?
[12:29:32] <guide_X> Perhaps I'm asking the wrong way, if I have "<table><tr class="rootitem"><td>...</td></tr><tr class="myCurrentItem"><td>...</td></tr></table>" and $(tr) is the "tr.myCurrentItem" one, but I want "tr.rootitem", how do I get it?
[12:30:23] <BillCriswell> $(tr).prev()
[12:30:24] <guide_X> closest is giving me undefined, parent().find("tr") works, but not parent().find("tr.rootitem")
[12:30:32] <guide_X> oh hmm let me try that thanks
[12:30:33] <BillCriswell> Thought you just asked this lol
[12:30:40] <guide_X> yeah never figured it out though heh
[12:30:51] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:31:39] <guide_X> aha thanks that worked.. console.log($(tr).prev("tr.invoice_proposal_rootitem").html());
[12:33:09] <BillCriswell> guide_X: The selector my be extraneous and basically works as a filter in this case.
[12:34:17] <guide_X> oh I see... actually prevAll works better
[12:34:29] <guide_X> because if i'm several tr's down, I don't get it, but with prevall I do
[12:34:35] <guide_X> but same concept
[12:37:41] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Word.
[12:41:01] <helpplease_sam> Hi there! Any idea why this wouldn't work? var id = 'content.html ' + $(this).attr('name');
[12:41:01] <helpplease_sam> I know that's lacking context, but this is so tremendously confusing.
[12:41:01] <helpplease_sam> And it involves two files, so I don't know how I could jsfiddle it.
[12:45:16] <shoky> helpplease_sam: it highly depends on what "this" is, and also what "wouldn't work" means
[12:45:16] <wunz> why do ppl use var $name vs var name? what is the difference?
[12:45:39] <BillCriswell> wunz: It's a matter of preference.
[12:45:51] <wunz> ah ok, thought there was something special about it
[12:45:52] <BillCriswell> I like it because I can assume it's a jQuery variable.
[12:46:04] <wunz> ah thats smart
[12:46:14] <wunz> i should start doing the same for jq vars
[12:46:35] <BillCriswell> wunz: Different strokes for different folks!
[12:46:48] <decx> i get confused by it
[12:46:59] <decx> too many $ on the dancefloor
[12:47:05] <BillCriswell> decx: My god damn PHP is leaking.
[12:47:35] <decx> yuk, cover that up
[12:48:58] <BillCriswell> I hate when iOS forces you to connect to Wifi to download something.
[12:49:15] <BillCriswell> I mean I appreciate it looking out for my data plan and everything, but still.
[12:50:33] <frank_o> So I'm working on a jQuery tap indicator (to create these "mini shockwaves" when the user taps her mobile) -- what do you guys think? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/u3fca/
[12:50:55] <frank_o> It looks kinda messy code-wise -- hoping there are ways to make it look prettier.
[12:51:25] <BillCriswell> No matter how hard I smash my screen the ripple is the same size!!!
[12:51:46] <BillCriswell> I always wanted to build a little strength test app to see how many people I can get to smash their screens.
[12:58:20] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Can but won't :P
[13:03:18] <_August_> I have a question and im almost thinking its somewhat impossible to solve this problem, I am trying to parse data from a url that might be using jsonp i am not entirely sure it is but problem #1 is why does this code keep adding data to the url #2 how can i get rid of it and #3 is it possible to parse data from the url given? Provided that i see the data in the browser but its blank when i try to parse it out http://pastebin.com/vR29jNgJ
[13:04:01] <mrchrisr> I'm scrolling down the page which is a time line and I want the Day to stay at the top of the page, and then when the next day appears i want that to stay at the top.  The day title is in a div. What's the easiest way to do this?
[13:05:50] <jcubic> _August_: it's not jsonp it's json
[13:06:46] <jcubic> _August_: and it don't use CORS you will need to write proxy in for instance php or other language n the server
[13:07:31] <_August_> jcubic: a proxy?
[13:08:00] <jcubic> _August_: a script that will read the url on the server and return to the browser so you can call using ajax
[13:08:29] <KingThor> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/Beb9w/2/ any idea why it's breaking when i get to the last slide?
[13:08:30] <jcubic> in php there is curl to fetch data from other pages
[13:10:18] <_August_> jcubic: i havent tried using curl but i tried using jsonencode and it came back blank
[13:10:55] <_August_> jcubic: but you think curl would work in this situation?
[13:12:02] <jcubic> _August_: json_encode is to convert object to json string you need to fetch the url. Curl is like ajax on the server you'll get content of the page that's on other server
[13:12:31] <_August_> ok, let me give it a shot and see if it works
[13:13:33] <screamingbanshee> it came back blank?
[13:13:55] <screamingbanshee> but you know for certain the payload should have been there?
[13:14:10] <_August_> you talking to me?
[13:14:14] <screamingbanshee> yeah sorry
[13:15:02] <screamingbanshee> I'm asking because there's a pernicious, subtle bug in php json_encode and json_decode
[13:15:29] <screamingbanshee> it's not even really a bug, it's a weakness of the language design but yeah
[13:15:59] <_August_> yeah, if you go to the url you can see the data there but when i tried json_decode or encode i forget which one i used the results came back blank
[13:15:59] <_August_> i probably should have tried curl but i really didnt think it would work
[13:16:33] <screamingbanshee> if php is receiving the data from the ajax call, it would have been json_decode. if it's sending it to the ajax call, it's json_encode
[13:17:10] <BillCriswell> KingThor: index is becoming undefined when you reach slide 6.
[13:17:22] <jcubic> you don't need to use encode/decode on the server just pass that to browser
[13:17:22] <screamingbanshee> okay I see part of the problem
[13:18:08] <screamingbanshee> it's throwing an error 500. can you access the server logs? we should probably move to msg because this is going to get pretty OT
[13:19:58] <jwmann> How would I clone an element, and then delete it the original element after I finish cloning?
[13:20:23] <NoiseEee> jwmann: what would your guess be?
[13:21:14] <jwmann> NoiseEee: $( '.foobar' ).clone().appendTo( '#mydiv' ).remove();
[13:21:39] <NoiseEee> jwmann: try it and see?  might need more than one line
[13:22:07] <jwmann> I have tried it already =\ It deleted my cloned element instead
[13:22:32] <jwmann> I tried doing appendTo().end().remove() but that didn't work either
[13:22:36] <frank_o> Working on this tap indicator, like "mini shockwaves" when the user taps her mobile -- supercool for mobile UX -- are there any ways to make it look prettier code-wise though? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/u3fca/
[13:23:39] <NoiseEee> var orig = $('.foobar');  orig.clone().appendTo($('#myDiv'));  orig.remove()  (or maybe even orig.first().remove)
[13:33:31] <tvle83> do i need to do something special to have angular and jquery mobile to play nice together ? when i include both i am getting errors https://gist.github.com/tvl83/9218323
[13:37:59] <helpplease_sam> Hey. So I posted an hour or two ago about an issue I was having. Here's the best I can do with a jsfiddle, help would be massively appreciated! Thanks http://jsfiddle.net/Mfuck/1/
[13:40:29] <WebJonas> Hi guys! http://kmbyggtegninger.no/beta3/v2/index.html
[13:40:41] <WebJonas> So any idea if you click the accordion and click on an image
[13:40:52] <WebJonas> why the image opens in a new tab and the gallery?
[13:47:10] <decx> hey frank_o i think i've gone a bit overboard (and bored) http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8tL9c/
[13:51:18] <decx> should've tested in chrome lol
[13:54:40] <decx> ah
[13:54:46] <decx> -webkitkeyframes
[13:54:50] <decx> damn prefixes
[13:54:51] <decx> fixed
[14:00:55] <nezZario> is there a .done for .html() ?
[14:01:13] <nezZario> or does .html() return when the content is rendered or just starting to render?
[14:01:31] <duch_kazatel> nezZario huh?
[14:01:58] <nezZario> $('#foo').html("<p>big long chunk of html</p>"); alert('a');[C[C
[14:02:19] <nezZario> does alert fire as soon as that ID has html, or after it's done rendering?  I think it's the former, and I need the latter
[14:02:27] <nezZario> has that* html
[14:02:50] <NoiseEee> nezZario: it synchronous.  alert('a') happens after #foo gets/displays the html
[14:04:09] <nezZario> are you sure?
[14:04:14] <duch_kazatel> nezZario why does it matter?
[14:04:21] <duch_kazatel> nezZario the markup exists.
[14:04:30] <Minty> duch_kazatel: thanks so much for your help earlier
[14:04:40] <nezZario> the next statement needs to know the height of the element after the html has been replaced
[14:04:49] <Minty> duch_kazatel: I came across a jquery plugin for cross-browser mousewheel support so firefox works fine now
[14:05:06] <nezZario> I'm using jquery custom content scroller - if I tell it to update the scroll height immediately it doesn't work, if i do a settimeout for 1 sec (just to test) it always works
[14:05:08] <Minty> duch_kazatel: oddly though, the animation no longer works in chrome. I've made no changes to the actual scroll animation function and it just doesn't work!
[14:05:25] <duch_kazatel> nezZario http://jsfiddle.net/pqCuR/
[14:06:00] <duch_kazatel> Minty weird.
[14:06:02] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i genuinely think there has been some update to chrome just this afternoon
[14:06:04] <Minty> duch_kazatel: must have
[14:06:19] <duch_kazatel> probably wasn't.
[14:06:28] <duch_kazatel> things aren't usually THAT volatile unless you're doing crazy stuff.
[14:06:30] <duch_kazatel> which you aren't.
[14:06:38] <Minty> true
[14:07:46] <Minty> duch_kazatel: mind checking it out in chrome to make sure it isn't just my browser? http://dev.adamcunnington.info
[14:08:05] <Minty> duch_kazatel: there is a message "firing" that is logged everytime the animation function fires. Works great in IE and firefox
[14:08:16] <duch_kazatel> woah that's annoying.
[14:09:22] <Minty> duch_kazatel: weird huh?
[14:09:35] <Minty> the animation function is probably the only thing that hasn't been touched!
[14:09:48] <Minty> arrow keys, links, mousewheel - none of it is working!
[14:09:58] <Minty> not used to IE giving me what I want ahead of chrome!
[14:10:16] <Minty> is there any sort of 'verbose debugging' i can turn on?
[14:10:24] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: fwiw i always get 20
[14:10:31] <nezZario> even if I add a bunch of content
[14:10:35] <nezZario> and .html() has no .done()
[14:10:55] <nhulea_nsa> so I am still having trouble with my cross origin problem ? Any one got any tips ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/a87rC/5/
[14:11:17] <duch_kazatel> Minty huh?
[14:11:32] <Minty> duch_kazatel: not telling me it works for you?
[14:11:50] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't work in chrome, but the effect is awful to me.
[14:11:55] <duch_kazatel> i would never use it.
[14:12:00] <Minty> oh
[14:12:04] <Minty> what do you mean by awful?
[14:12:40] <Minty> i'm using jquery.requestAnimationFrame.min.js too to make it smoother
[14:12:47] <duch_kazatel> it's terrible UX.  you're telling the end user "you don't get a choice in how you scroll"
[14:12:50] <duch_kazatel> i'd leave a site like that.
[14:13:20] <Minty> duch_kazatel: ok! well i'd appreciate some tips on how to improve it
[14:13:26] <duch_kazatel> also - $("section").mousewheel(function (event) { is likely the problem.
[14:13:28] <duch_kazatel> bind to document.
[14:13:36] <duch_kazatel> but i'd remove that mousewheel function all together.
[14:13:53] <Minty> just leave the arrow key navigation?
[14:14:18] <duch_kazatel> i'd get rid of that, too, but that's just me.
[14:14:27] <Minty> ok
[14:14:37] <Minty> i don't think the mousewheel bind is breaking chrome though
[14:14:41] <Minty> because arrow keys don't work there either
[14:14:44] <Minty> nor does clicking on the links
[14:14:53] <duch_kazatel> actually, it is.  hover over that black strip at the top and scroll.
[14:15:09] <duch_kazatel> you want to capture that event in the entire document, not in specific divs.
[14:15:36] <Minty> i don't
[14:15:44] <Minty> i only wanted it to be captured in one of the sections
[14:15:48] <Minty> it shouldn
[14:15:53] <Minty> it shouldn't apply in header and footer
[14:15:54] <duch_kazatel> so the user should only scroll in one section?
[14:15:59] <duch_kazatel> that's awful.
[14:17:15] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i've disabled the scrolling
[14:17:25] <Minty> duch_kazatel: still got no idea why arrow keys / links don't work in chrome though
[14:17:28] <Minty> that's completely retarded :S
[14:17:35] <duch_kazatel> let the end user do their own scrolling.
[14:17:40] <duch_kazatel> unbind from the arrows, too.
[14:17:46] <Minty> i've spent like 2 days on this
[14:17:51] <Minty> and you're just completely slating it
[14:17:57] <Minty> bit of grace, please!
[14:18:09] <Minty> i'll keep the effects on the arrow keys
[14:18:16] <duch_kazatel> just being honest.  you're working against known UX patterns.
[14:18:40] <Minty> it's just a parallax implementation
[14:18:42] <Minty> lots of sites do it
[14:18:51] <Minty> but anyway, any idea why it's just decided to stop working on chrome?
[14:18:59] <duch_kazatel> they do
[14:18:59] <decx> fixed scroll&arrow sliding is a persistent fad
[14:19:00] <duch_kazatel> ?
[14:19:06] <BillCriswell> If other sites jumped off a bridge would you do it too?
[14:19:07] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:19:15] <Minty> BillCriswell: yes
[14:19:19] <BillCriswell> =)
[14:19:28] <BillCriswell> Website suicide is a serious issue.
[14:19:34] <ajustrun> hey guys, i have a super strange issue. the lightbox on this page is downloading a file. but its only happening on this page... http://www.grailed.com/listings/2427-japan-blue-jb0212
[14:19:41] <ajustrun> and i have no idea why
[14:19:43] <duch_kazatel> also: minty you're not doing parallax.
[14:19:56] <Minty> ok
[14:20:02] <Minty> able to shed any light on the chrome issue?
[14:20:25] <Minty> it seems it happened since i implemented the cross browser mousewheel script, this is now commented out but i don't see why it should break the effect when clicking on a link
[14:21:17] <BillCriswell> ajustrun: That's an issue server side.
[14:21:28] <duch_kazatel> "cannot read property "top" of undefined"
[14:21:28] <ajustrun> how do you know?
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> Minty tells me that $newSection isn't anything on pageload.
[14:22:04] <duch_kazatel> also - setting a variable with var multiple times is dirty.
[14:22:17] <BillCriswell> ajustrun: http://assets1.grailed.com/uploads/photo/image/10816/showpage_upload_2F1393203739691-k8ja30v9mwkoi529-a0b6a313ce97410c8d4cedf2881304ca_2F going here directly causes a download.
[14:22:22] <Minty> duch_kazatel: is var global?
[14:22:23] <duch_kazatel> declare once at the top with var $newSection;, then remove the keyward "var" everywhere else it appears.
[14:22:25] <duch_kazatel> for that var.
[14:22:27] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:22:28] <BillCriswell> OSX is picking it up as a document.
[14:22:36] <Minty> ok
[14:22:38] <duch_kazatel> Minty you're scoping that var into those functions.
[14:22:46] <Minty> oh ok
[14:22:52] <ajustrun> BillCriswell: gotcha. thats so weird because im uploading to s3 and its the only link that is doing it
[14:22:53] <duch_kazatel> Minty so declare it after $currentSection.
[14:22:54] <Minty> newSection isn't supposed to be anything on page load btw
[14:22:58] <Minty> ok will do, thanks
[14:23:00] <duch_kazatel> Minty you should read about scoping in javascript
[14:23:00] <ajustrun> must be an issue with the file that is uploaded
[14:23:12] <BillCriswell> ajustrun: Could totally be that, definitely a weird one.
[14:23:42] <Minty> reading about scoping now
[14:23:49] <Minty> duch_kazatel: still doesn't explain why chrome just won't "move" though
[14:23:57] <duch_kazatel> because of the error.
[14:24:00] <Minty> $("html").stop().animate({         scrollTop: $element     }, 800, "swing"); is failing
[14:24:02] <Minty> there is no error
[14:24:06] <duch_kazatel> yes there is.
[14:24:18] <Minty> where?
[14:24:21] <duch_kazatel> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined scroll.js:13
[14:24:27] <duch_kazatel> the console
[14:24:28] <Minty> i'm not getting that
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> bummer?
[14:24:42] <Minty> my console is blank
[14:24:48] <duch_kazatel> make sure you have the console open and hard refresh the page.
[14:24:50] <duch_kazatel> while it's open.
[14:24:55] <Minty> have done
[14:24:57] <Minty> several times
[14:25:04] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you're doing wrong then.
[14:25:22] <duch_kazatel> firefox and IE are being more forgiving it looks like.
[14:25:29] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[14:26:50] <Minty> duch_kazatel: http://screencast.com/t/kp45UA3Ma
[14:26:52] <Minty> no errors
[14:26:54] <duch_kazatel> no thank you.
[14:27:02] <duch_kazatel> you do realize i'm at work, right?
[14:27:35] <Minty> it was only 10 seconds but ok
[14:27:37] <Minty> sorry
[14:28:44] <duch_kazatel> did you change something?  i was just getting an error.
[14:28:49] <Minty> nothing changed
[14:28:52] <Minty> well
[14:28:54] <Minty> like 10 mins ago
[14:29:07] <Minty> i thought it was weird because line 13 is event.preventDefault
[14:29:29] <Minty> think you had an old version cached or something
[14:29:49] <Minty> but this whole thing is strange. the effect worked absolutely fine on chrome like 2 hours ago
[14:33:36] <duch_kazatel> your logic is very strange.  i'd wrap the two vars up top within the doc ready and give them default values, instead.
[14:34:14] <duch_kazatel> *then
[14:34:19] <duch_kazatel> woops wrong window.
[14:35:10] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i'm experiencing a bug with arrow navigation anyway in that it ocassionaly skips 2 sections which is odd
[14:35:23] <duch_kazatel> Minty breakpoint on line 34...
[14:35:25] <Minty> i think it may due to the speed of scrollspy firing
[14:35:46] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:35:49] <duch_kazatel> breakpoint on line 34.
[14:35:54] <duch_kazatel> that never gets hit.
[14:36:55] <Minty> that's weird
[14:37:02] <Minty> why
[14:37:16] <Minty> oh
[14:37:35] <Minty> hmm i don't know why
[14:37:55] <Minty> i'll pull it out and put at top of script
[14:38:26] <duch_kazatel> move them to inside the document ready.
[14:39:09] <Minty> ok
[14:40:21] <Minty> chrome still not working
[14:40:35] <Minty> and i think the bug with arrow key navigation is when you hit up/down fast
[14:40:52] <duch_kazatel> again, line 34 is not getting hit.
[14:41:13] <duch_kazatel> how are you trying to debug this?
[14:41:38] <Minty> wait, have you refreshed?
[14:41:40] <Minty> i keep updating
[14:41:46] <Minty> not sure what line 34 is for you
[14:42:18] <duch_kazatel> let me clarify the problem - $currentSection isn't set to anything.
[14:42:28] <duch_kazatel> fix that.
[14:42:43] <duch_kazatel> your old check of if (!$currentSection) likely wasn't doing what you thought it was.
[14:43:02] <Minty> hmm
[14:43:13] <Minty> so this must mean that $("section").first() isn't available
[14:43:15] <Minty> at .ready
[14:43:20] <duch_kazatel> put that bit back in.  before it, console.log $currentSection
[14:43:32] <duch_kazatel> actually, that WILL be available at ready.
[14:43:40] <duch_kazatel> you're overcomplicating things a good amount.
[14:43:54] <Minty> duch_kazatel: [section#about, prevObject: b.fn.b.init[5], context: document, jquery: "1.9.1", constructor: function, init: function…]
[14:44:11] <Minty> it is set
[14:44:21] <Minty> yet it says ReferenceError: $currentSection is not defined
[14:44:23] <Minty> what the hell.
[14:44:26] <duch_kazatel> wait/.
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah there we go.
[14:44:30] <Minty> i've literally just logged it
[14:44:34] <Minty> that makes NO sense
[14:44:35] <Minty> i set it
[14:44:38] <Minty> then log it
[14:44:41] <Minty> the log shows it's value
[14:44:52] <Minty> but i type $currentSection in console and undefined
[14:44:55] <Minty> how is that possible
[14:44:59] <Minty> i've just logged the value of it
[14:45:22] <duch_kazatel> is that up on your site?
[14:45:25] <Minty> yea
[14:45:28] <Minty> dev.adamcunnington.info
[14:46:24] <Minty> i set it, log it, shows fine, then i type $currentSection into console and it says undefined. wth
[14:46:41] <Minty> it's like it only sets it for a split second, then disappears
[14:46:41] <duch_kazatel> that's expected.
[14:46:46] <duch_kazatel> it's not scoped globally.
[14:46:46] <Minty> que?!
[14:46:54] <duch_kazatel> so it's not going to be available in your console.
[14:47:04] <duch_kazatel> you really need to go learn the basics.
[14:47:09] <Minty> is that why mny program is working weirdly?
[14:47:27] <duch_kazatel> because you don't know the basics?  yes :p
[14:47:36] <Minty> duch_kazatel: you said to put it within ready
[14:47:39] <Minty> so i did
[14:48:05] <duch_kazatel> slow your roll.  brb, then I'll actually poke at it. but you need to learn the basics.
[14:48:08] <duch_kazatel> don't put this off on me.
[14:48:10] <duch_kazatel> btw
[14:48:11] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:48:24] <Minty> ok
[14:48:26] <Minty> thanks
[14:48:38] <Minty> i've scoped it globally now but still doesn't explain why even clicking on the links isn't working in chrome
[14:50:15] <KingThor> I'm trying to work out why index is not being defined, even if I declare it to equal '0' Can anyone lend an eye?
[14:50:15] <KingThor> http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/Beb9w/3/
[14:50:18] <__joshua__> Minty: im late to the party.  should those links to stuff?
[14:50:57] <__joshua__> KingThor: im getting no error?
[14:50:58] <Minty> __joshua__: yea they do anbd works perfect in everything other than chrome
[14:51:58] <KingThor> __joshua__: if you slide to the last slide and attempt to go back, it loses the index
[14:52:30] <__joshua__> Minty: and you are using jquery animations for a clicks (there is a click handler on them, at least)?
[14:52:36] <Laire> Hello, i have a json object, how can I get the value is i know the key?
[14:53:05] <Laire> something like key->value?
[14:55:32] <__joshua__> KingThor: line 22
[14:56:08] <__joshua__> Laire:  object[key] or object.key, if its a javascript object.
[14:56:47] <__joshua__> KingThor: getCurrentSelection can return undefined
[14:57:58] <Laire> __joshua__ thx
[14:59:49] <KingThor> __joshua__: hmm
[14:59:57] <duch_kazatel> Minty try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/v8Yw7/
[15:01:22] <__joshua__> Minty: use body, not html for scroll
[15:01:28] <__joshua__> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/UGUjeyWK
[15:01:35] <duch_kazatel> for ultimate compat, use both
[15:01:36] <__joshua__> works in chrome
[15:01:41] <duch_kazatel> $("html, body")
[15:01:58] <__joshua__> right, duch found it too
[15:03:16] <__joshua__> KingThor, just return len-1; at end of function
[15:03:47] <__joshua__> although you dont currently need that function at all, as index maintains the current element
[15:04:15] <Minty> duch_kazatel: using "body" produced error in chrome before, apparently deprecated
[15:04:20] <Minty> no longer an attribute of body
[15:04:22] <Minty> but document only
[15:04:32] <KingThor1> __joshua__: lost that first part
[15:04:35] <duch_kazatel> Minty do  $("html, body")
[15:05:10] <Minty> thank you so much!
[15:05:29] <Minty> works great
[15:05:55] <mrchrisr> Hi All, is there a way I can make the current and relevant heading stick to the top of the page?  I'd like whatever heading is relevant to the current point on the page to be stuck to the top.
[15:06:35] <__joshua__> agh right KingThor, you do need that one.  one moment....
[15:06:55] <duch_kazatel> mrchrisr this might help: https://github.com/thesmart/jquery-scrollspy
[15:07:51] <Minty> duch_kazatel: the only other problem i have is that scroll spy's enter fires for every section it enters. depending on the size of your viewport, using the arrows to scroll, you may enter 2 sections with 1 movement
[15:08:10] <__joshua__> KingThor1: http://jsfiddle.net/Beb9w/4/ but you have an overscrolling issue
[15:08:28] <duch_kazatel> Minty okay?
[15:08:31] <Minty> duch_kazatel: how would i implement logic to circumvent this? i was thinking of using :exit rather than :enter but the trouble with exit is i don't know the "direction" so i can't work out which section the scroll is going towards
[15:08:43] <duch_kazatel> why is that a problem?
[15:08:47] <Minty> it causes a bug
[15:08:53] <duch_kazatel> what bug?
[15:08:56] <Minty> because each time a new section is entered, currentSection updates
[15:09:27] <duch_kazatel> sure.  like it should.
[15:09:34] <KingThor1> __joshua__: in that if i hit next at slide 6, it thinks it's in slide 7 without an actual slide 7
[15:09:39] <Minty> so you're in services, you hit down and it takes you to resources but then by the time the scroll 'finishes' it actually updates currentSection to one lower; testimonials
[15:09:41] <mrchrisr> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:09:54] <duch_kazatel> okay.  why is that a problem?
[15:10:01] <Minty> duch_kazatel: well no, because when you hit down next, it thinks the nextsection is the one after testimonials; connect
[15:10:09] <Minty> so you're never actually 'focused' on testimonials but you pass through it
[15:10:19] <duch_kazatel> okay.  then tie your update into the exit of a section.
[15:10:23] <Minty> see for yourself, maximise your browser window and go down and back up, you'll soon skip one
[15:10:26] <__joshua__> actually im my view if you scroll too far right the right with the scrollbar you must hit back twice
[15:10:29] <Minty> duch_kazatel: but as i said, i can't
[15:10:37] <__joshua__> don't know if that is intentional or not
[15:10:39] <Minty> duch_kazatel: because i don't know the 'direction', so i don't know what the new section is
[15:11:07] <__joshua__> isn't the direction just the last event?
[15:11:15] <Minty> or are you suggesting i revert the logic and rather than track currentSection, effectively track "oldSection"?
[15:11:30] <duch_kazatel> i'm suggesting that this is part of the problem of the UX you've chosen.
[15:11:42] <KingThor1> __joshua__: right. there's that. so var i needs to calculate total amount of slides and never go over
[15:14:15] <Minty> this is shit :|
[15:14:26] <Minty> i'm going to have to track exit and enter and only accept the value if it is within 1 section of exit
[15:19:04] <KingThor1> __joshua__: not intentional
[15:19:05] <__joshua__> Minty: what exactly is the problem here?  surely the last section they entered is good enough
[15:19:18] <Minty> __joshua__: nope. 1 sec
[15:20:02] <Minty> can i do this; if ($this == $oldSection.prev() or $this == $newSection.prev()) {
[15:20:07] <Minty> i'm getting unexpected identifier error
[15:21:06] <Minty> maybe || ?
[15:21:31] <duch_kazatel> Minty ...
[15:21:49] <Minty> the hell sort of language doesn't have or
[15:21:56] <duch_kazatel> Minty javascript has or
[15:21:59] <duch_kazatel> it's ||
[15:22:03] <Minty> i realised
[15:22:05] <Minty> but that sucks
[15:22:16] <Minty> why are we throwing pipes in when the english word, or does the trick perfectly
[15:22:38] <duch_kazatel> because we have ||
[15:24:07] <__joshua__> what language?  c, c++, java, the syntactic inspiration for javascript
[15:25:30] <duch_kazatel> python uses or iirc.
[15:25:57] <duch_kazatel> and Minty javascrpt carries a lot of historical cruft.
[15:26:42] <Minty> ofc python uses or
[15:26:48] <__joshua__> || makes sense, partically use the binary or (|) operator
[15:26:53] <Minty> __joshua__: lol what fantastic inspiration for syntax; c.
[15:27:02] <Minty> __joshua__: or makes more sense
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> it's apart of the C family.
[15:27:08] <Minty> roughly a billion times
[15:27:09] <duch_kazatel> and || makes more sense imo.
[15:27:24] <duch_kazatel> reads better to me.
[15:27:29] <Minty> if you think || to represent or makes more sense than the word, or, then you've been looking at a screen too long
[15:27:41] <duch_kazatel> "hey guys I need help"
[15:27:43] <__joshua__> '||' is concat in postgres.  that bit me once
[15:27:48] <duch_kazatel> *starts insulting people left and right*
[15:27:55] <duch_kazatel> "thanks for the help!  i need more"
[15:27:56] <Minty> how is that insulting?
[15:27:59] <duch_kazatel> *more insults*
[15:28:03] <Minty> was making a casual jest
[15:28:08] <Minty> you've made about a hundred of those
[15:28:13] <duch_kazatel> just sayin' :P
[15:33:13] <Minty> probably a stupid question
[15:33:28] <Minty> how can i keep a variable locally scoped but use the same name in several functions
[15:33:52] <Minty> or is everything within .ready(function () accessible anyway
[15:34:32] <duch_kazatel> javascript is scoped to the function.
[15:34:57] <duch_kazatel> so it's available in that function and all functions it closes over.
[15:35:22] <Minty> so if i want to use the same variable name within lots of functions but have them all local, separate vars
[15:35:35] <Minty> can i do that given that all these functions are within a single document.ready( function that is called
[15:35:36] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[15:35:41] <Minty> wow
[15:35:46] <duch_kazatel> that's really confusing.
[15:35:46] <Minty> so i have to give them different names?
[15:35:49] <Minty> confusing?
[15:35:55] <Minty> in javascript perhaps
[15:35:57] <duch_kazatel> nogiving locally scoped vars the same name?>
[15:36:08] <Minty> but they're within separate functions
[15:36:11] <duch_kazatel> that's way confusing.
[15:36:24] <Minty> so you think 2 functions in the same program that deal with numbers
[15:36:37] <__joshua__> "use strict" at the top of every top level function.  will solve your redeclaration problems
[15:36:37] <Minty> aren't both allowed to have functions with a local variable in each called number
[15:36:40] <Minty> that's confusing?
[15:36:57] <duch_kazatel> Minty you're putting words in my mouth.
[15:37:10] <__joshua__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1047454/what-is-lexical-scope
[15:37:11] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i'm not - you must have misunderstood what i was saying
[15:37:58] <duch_kazatel> you want to reuse variable names within separate functions.
[15:38:02] <Minty> http://pastebin.com/bjkSAtaX
[15:38:05] <Minty> i literally want that
[15:38:14] <Minty> what do you mean by "reuse"
[15:38:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/pt7KB/2/
[15:38:18] <Minty> they're all separate, in separate functions
[15:38:21] <Minty> surely separate scopes
[15:38:22] <duch_kazatel> take a look at that.
[15:38:37] <duch_kazatel> you have to prepend with the var keyword, in any event, to scope your variablkes.
[15:38:40] <duch_kazatel> *variables
[15:39:01] <Minty> ok, question on that; http://jsfiddle.net/pt7KB/3/
[15:39:03] <KingThor1> __joshua__: i'm completely stuck, but thanks for your eyes on this. MUCH appreciated.
[15:39:14] <__joshua__> oh wait
[15:39:23] <__joshua__> KingThor1: what is the problem?
[15:39:25] <__joshua__> the overscroll?
[15:39:40] <duch_kazatel> Minty exactly - http://jsfiddle.net/pt7KB/4/
[15:40:19] <duch_kazatel> javascript is lexically scoped.  you'd do well to learn about closures.
[15:40:25] <Minty> duch_kazatel: ok great. so what is confusing about that?
[15:40:43] <KingThor1> var len is already calculating the total amount of slides, so i've moved past that, thinking it has something to do with its declared width
[15:40:50] <Minty> duch_kazatel: does that whole picture change when everything isd with in 1 document .ready func?
[15:40:56] <duch_kazatel> Minty nope.
[15:41:00] <duch_kazatel> Minty a function is a function.
[15:41:10] <Minty> that doesn't mean anything
[15:41:15] <duch_kazatel> yes it does.
[15:41:18] <duch_kazatel> in javascript it does.
[15:41:20] <Minty> in python, when a func is within another func, variables from the sub-func are accessible within func
[15:41:28] <duch_kazatel> that is not the case in javascript.
[15:41:33] <duch_kazatel> due to lexical scoping.
[15:41:41] <Minty> ok
[15:41:44] <Minty> fair enough
[15:41:50] <Minty> but "a function is a function" doesn't account for that
[15:41:52] <duch_kazatel> the var keyword is important for that, btw.
[15:41:55] <Minty> that's an extreme type of scoping
[15:42:01] <duch_kazatel> you asked if the document ready changes that.
[15:42:38] <duch_kazatel> that's why I said "a function is a function"
[15:42:43] <duch_kazatel> which is also an object, go figure.
[15:42:54] <__joshua__> let me have a play, KingThor1
[15:43:06] <__joshua__> can you link the fiddle again?
[15:43:20] <duch_kazatel> Minty just wait until you start trying to do classical inheritance in javascript and it doesn't work.  you'll have fun there.
[15:43:30] <Minty> coming froim python, i expect everything to be an object anyway, i like that
[15:43:38] <Minty> python is just sheer beauty, so pleased i'm doing it this way round!
[15:43:49] <KingThor1> http://jsfiddle.net/Beb9w/4/
[15:43:51] <duch_kazatel> what other languages are you familiar with?
[15:43:55] <Minty> duch_kazatel: inheritance in which respect? javascript doesn't have classes per se does it?
[15:44:03] <Minty> i am incredibly light on c
[15:44:06] <Minty> i know php
[15:44:06] <__joshua__> its prototypical oo model
[15:44:08] <duch_kazatel> nope.  javascript has prototypes
[15:44:23] <Minty> prototypical oo model?
[15:44:25] <duch_kazatel> *Prototypal
[15:44:26] <Minty> that sounds paradoxical!
[15:44:34] <Minty> like "capitalist communism"
[15:44:42] <duch_kazatel> not prototypical, prototypal
[15:44:42] <Minty> or static typed OOP
[15:45:08] <Minty> any good links on what you mean by prototypal?
[15:45:13] <duch_kazatel> either way, javascript has some interesting warts.  but they're pretty easily dealt with.
[15:45:25] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chainf
[15:45:28] <duch_kazatel> err, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain
[15:45:31] <duch_kazatel> no f on theend.
[15:48:22] <__joshua__> KingThor1: http://jsfiddle.net/Beb9w/6/
[15:52:09] <KingThor1> __joshua__: effin a
[15:52:43] <KingThor1> the len-1 on line 38...
[15:52:50] <__joshua__> yup
[15:53:01] <__joshua__> one off errors.  classic
[15:54:31] <duch_kazatel> the fencepost error!
[15:54:34] <KingThor1> __joshua__: let me ask you, how could i get around declaring that #main wrapper width in CSS, using jquery, to make it dynamic, if a user were to add more slides
[15:55:50] <Minty> cheers
[15:55:52] <Minty> interesting
[15:55:55] <Minty> this is fucking driving me insane
[15:56:01] <Minty> still skipping sections when scrolling with arrow keys
[15:56:03] <Minty> SO irritating
[15:56:09] <Minty> tried so many different work arounds
[15:57:26] <Minty> exit and enter both fire for multiple sections
[15:57:35] <Minty> anything in the viewport, not just what is actually 'in focus'
[15:57:40] <Minty> this creates me huge logical problems
[15:58:03] <Minty> how easy is it to delay a function in javascript
[15:58:11] <duch_kazatel> easy, but the wrong way to approach things.
[15:58:21] <duch_kazatel> do an event based approach instead of relying on timers.
[15:58:23] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i'm out of ideas
[15:58:38] <siepet> how can i get document.location of url i want?
[15:58:39] <__joshua__> KingThor1: one sec
[15:58:52] <Minty> duch_kazatel: the only reason why i am using scrollspy is to detect when a user scrolls with the slider bar
[15:58:57] <Minty> everything else i can just track
[15:59:22] <Minty> but it's impossible to isolate from the enter and exit functions whether or not it was the slider bar causing the scroll or keyboard buttons
[15:59:56] <Minty> unless i have some variable for keyboardUsed = true
[16:00:04] <duch_kazatel> global var with last scroll action?
[16:00:20] <Minty> is that an ok thing to do in javascript?
[16:00:25] <Minty> in python, global vars are disgusting
[16:00:28] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/Beb9w/7/
[16:00:33] <Minty> you should never mutate anything of global state in py
[16:00:37] <duch_kazatel> same with javascript.
[16:00:42] <Minty> eugh
[16:00:47] <Minty> what's the better way then
[16:00:49] <__joshua__> Minty: not always true
[16:00:51] <duch_kazatel> sorry, by "global" i mean declare it in the doc ready.
[16:00:56] <__joshua__> but almost always
[16:01:01] <Laire> How can I get the text of <h2> when i click in this example: http://fiddle.jshell.net/XJ6qS/ ?
[16:01:03] <Minty> duch_kazatel: is that better?
[16:01:10] <Freeno> Is there any tutorial to use widget on your site with jquery UI? I download the zip and extracted the map, but I don't know what to do next
[16:01:26] <duch_kazatel> Minty it's smarter because you're not polluting the global namespace.
[16:01:37] <Minty> ok great, i'll give that a go
[16:01:55] <__joshua__>     $(this).find('h2').text(); probably, Laire
[16:02:30] <__joshua__> KingThor1: http://jsfiddle.net/Beb9w/7/ for you, btw
[16:02:52] <KingThor1> __joshua__: i owe you a beer, have a link?
[16:02:53] <KingThor1> :)
[16:03:06] <__joshua__> :D
[16:03:37] <Minty> haha the amount of syntax errors from True / False
[16:03:41] <Minty> can't get used to the lowercase
[16:04:05] <duch_kazatel> I had that same problem for a while.
[16:04:26] <Laire> __joshua__ thx
[16:06:12] <Minty> yes! finally http://dev.adamcunnington.info/
[16:06:35] <Minty> only thing it doesn't account for is the section "being looked at" when you refresh the page
[16:06:46] <Minty> when did browsers start remembering the part of the page you were viewing when you refreshed
[16:06:56] <duch_kazatel> since forever.
[16:07:05] <Minty> fair enough
[16:07:09] <duch_kazatel> be cool - use hashes to store shit and hyperlink.
[16:07:11] <Minty> shows how much i pay attention
[16:07:31] <Minty> how would i store?
[16:07:36] <duch_kazatel> window.location.hash
[16:07:51] <Minty> is that like some persistent memory that survives a refresh?
[16:08:11] <Minty> oh
[16:08:19] <Minty> just pulls the anchor from a URL that's not that exciting!
[16:08:24] <duch_kazatel> the #1 rule with javascript is "did you try"
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> you can also set the "anchor"
[16:08:34] <Minty> #1 rule in every language
[16:08:37] <Minty> duch_kazatel: that won't work though
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> window.location.hash = 'sexhaver'
[16:08:45] <Minty> what if the user uses the slider bar to scroll
[16:08:49] <Minty> how then do i store their location
[16:08:53] <duch_kazatel> in the hash.
[16:09:10] <Minty> hmm
[16:09:16] <Minty> how do i update the user's URL?
[16:09:18] <duch_kazatel> set the hash to the current section.  on pageload, check to see if it's defined.
[16:09:24] <duch_kazatel> by setting the hash.
[16:09:32] <Minty> how do i do that
[16:09:42] <Minty> i can literally set window.location.hash?
[16:09:43] <duch_kazatel> window.location.hash = 'aThing'
[16:09:44] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:09:48] <Minty> what wizardry is this
[16:09:52] <Minty> can i do
[16:09:59] <Minty> window.downloadPorn = true aswell?
[16:10:15] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:10:20] <Minty> javascript is worryingly powerful
[16:10:24] <Minty> i can just manipulate the user to hell
[16:10:33] <duch_kazatel> well, actually, window.downloadPorn is the same as var downloadPorn.
[16:10:43] <duch_kazatel> if you define that globally.
[16:10:47] <Minty> ruin all their presumed mouse and keyboard actions and replace them with random stuff
[16:10:51] <Minty> i can change their url
[16:10:58] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[16:11:08] <Minty> for every event, there is a hook
[16:11:12] <duch_kazatel> the browsers protect them from dangerous actions
[16:11:12] <Minty> you navigate a page with events
[16:11:22] <Minty> we can swap them all out
[16:11:27] <duch_kazatel> no, you can't.
[16:11:34] <duch_kazatel> there are many read only things you cannot touch.
[16:11:40] <Minty> ok
[16:13:53] <Minty> can i do this; var $currentSection = window.location.hash || $("section").first();
[16:14:14] <Minty> if so, i'll take all my || bashing back
[16:14:15] <duch_kazatel> sure, but use a ternary instead to be a little clearer.
[16:14:36] <Minty> ternary?
[16:14:38] <Minty> third what?
[16:14:56] <duch_kazatel> aka the conditional
[16:14:56] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[16:15:53] <duch_kazatel> $currentSection = (if window.location.hash.length > 0) ? window.location.hash : $("section").first());
[16:16:22] <Minty> i assumed i could just say window.location.hash
[16:16:28] <Minty> presumably returning null if it didn't exist
[16:16:42] <duch_kazatel> i believe you can do the other one, too.
[16:19:46] <Minty> duch_kazatel: any idea why it's being odd? http://dev.adamcunnington.info/#testimonials
[16:20:12] <duch_kazatel> because you're binding to the onHashChange event it looks like.
[16:20:24] <Minty> not sure where
[16:20:37] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[16:22:34] <duch_kazatel> oh you'll have to do something like window.on('hashChange', function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[16:22:56] <duch_kazatel> also, your final else in that document.keydown handler is making it so I can do trivial things like open my dev tools.
[16:26:51] <Minty> ah i was wondering why it wouldn't open
[16:26:53] <Minty> thanks
[16:27:24] <Minty> duch_kazatel: isn't that just because event.preventDefault is at the top?
[16:28:40] <duch_kazatel> did you try removing that else clause?
[16:30:05] <Minty> duch_kazatel: i didn't no, but surely that wouldn't help because this function catches all keydown and event.preventDefault was at the top of the function
[16:30:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd fix that either way.
[16:30:45] <duch_kazatel> maybe run your ifs and prevent in there.
[16:30:58] <Minty> i've just mopved the prevent doiwn
[16:31:00] <Minty> all good
[16:31:11] <duch_kazatel> you should only prevent within the ifs.
[16:31:30] <duch_kazatel> specifically.
[16:35:53] <Minty> duch_kazatel: thanks http://dev.adamcunnington.info/#resources
[16:36:40] <duch_kazatel> Minty not seeing my suggestion in action.
[16:36:59] <Minty> which bit? the preventdefault?
[16:37:31] <duch_kazatel> yup
[16:37:41] <Minty> disagreed :P
[16:37:46] <Minty> why is it better to put it within if statement
[16:37:48] <Minty> then it is repeated twice
[16:37:58] <Minty> scrollTo is outside the if statements
[16:38:07] <Minty> and besides any key presses that aren't of code 38 or 40 will be returned
[16:38:16] <duch_kazatel> because you're preventing the default action unnecessarily.
[16:38:17] <duch_kazatel> do it my way.
[16:38:41] <duch_kazatel> only prevent default when you need to.
[16:39:28] <Minty> but it's not
[16:39:28] <decx> damn i hate slow scroll
[16:39:39] <Minty> how is it preventing the action
[16:39:44] <Minty> it's only preventing 38 and 40
[16:40:12] <duch_kazatel> Minty whatever mang.  you want help, I offer it, you then say "NO :("
[16:40:15] <duch_kazatel> and then ask for more help.
[16:40:19] <Minty> no
[16:40:21] <duch_kazatel> not sure what to tell you at this point.
[16:40:22] <Minty> i'm trying to understand
[16:40:31] <Minty> i don't see how what you're suggesting is any different
[16:40:41] <Minty> except for it would have to be repeated twice, thus creating code redundancy
[16:40:59] <duch_kazatel> it would only run when you need it.
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> thus increasing code efficiencyu
[16:41:06] <Minty> and how is that different to now?
[16:41:17] <duch_kazatel> right now is runs no matter what.
[16:41:21] <Minty> no, it doesn't
[16:41:29] <Minty> just above it there is an else clause with return; inside
[16:41:42] <duch_kazatel> I'm saying you don't need to do that.
[16:41:49] <duch_kazatel> instead of returning nothing inside that else clause.
[16:42:09] <Minty> yes, but otherwise i need to move event.preventDefault() and scrollTo inside both if clauses
[16:42:11] <duch_kazatel> just not the way I would have done it.
[16:42:19] <Minty> so i'll have 2 lines of code that are repeated twice
[16:42:30] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[16:43:04] <neataroni> im looking for the simplest way to store html that will be dynamically inserted into a div on hash change- any suggestions?
[16:43:10] <Shero> hey I have an autocomplete function and I need to pass the variable that user choose to python
[16:44:37] <duch_kazatel> neataroni window.on('hashChange', function(){ var yourStuff = $('#yerDiv') });
[16:44:42] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[16:45:15] <neataroni> duch_kazatel: but i want the stuff in yerDiv to not be parsed by the browser
[16:45:30] <neataroni> until i put it in the content div
[16:45:43] <neataroni> i guess thats my real question
[16:45:44] <duch_kazatel> neataroni wat.  "parsed by the browser" then you need to setup an event handler on hashchange that feteches that content first.
[16:45:59] <neataroni> how do i include the html string without the browser parsing it
[16:46:11] <duch_kazatel> push it in as text first?
[16:46:49] <neataroni> duch_kazatel: what im asking is how to include that content on the page load so the browser doesnt listen to it, but then still be able to grab it with jquery
[16:46:58] <neataroni> its really not about jquery now that i think about it
[16:47:21] <neataroni> something like script type="somebullshittype" id=yerDiv
[16:47:40] <neataroni> i think thats how underscore templates are usually done
[16:48:17] <Minty> how can i check for undefined
[16:51:05] <__joshua__> typeof x === "undefined" ?
[16:52:41] <Minty> == or ===
[16:54:49] <duch_kazatel> depends
[16:54:56] <duch_kazatel> == uses type coercion
[16:54:58] <duch_kazatel> === doesn't
[16:58:01] <__joshua__> Minty, as a general rule, never use ==
[16:58:08] <Minty> ok
[16:58:15] <Minty> how do i check for an empty jquery object
[16:58:22] <__joshua__> for falsey tests (null, 0, '', undefined) use !
[16:58:38] <__joshua__> jquery?  !jq_obj.length
[16:59:18] <Minty> cheers
[17:01:56] <Minty> duch_kazatel: you know when i have a line of code that performs an animation
[17:02:03] <Minty> will the subsequent execution "hang" until that is done?
[17:02:56] <ZeuZ> what's wrong with: $({
[17:02:57] <ZeuZ> if (document.location.href.split('?')[1]=='undefined') {$('#boton').text('Subir');}
[17:02:57] <ZeuZ> });
[17:03:18] <duch_kazatel> Minty nope.  you have to put it in your callback after the animation is done.
[17:06:05] <ZeuZ> oh, nevermind
[17:07:04] <Minty> duch_kazatel: what do you mean?
[17:07:20] <Minty> basically, the reason why i ask is because if not, i NEED a delay, i can't see any way around this with events
[17:07:50] <Minty> there is no way for me to find out in the scroll spy enter function whether or not the user triggered that function with the slidder bar or whether it was done programatically
[17:08:06] <Minty> your suggestion before about having a global var that stores last scroll action won't work
[17:08:11] <Minty> because when does that var get *reset*
[17:08:18] <Minty> i need a delayed function that resets it
[17:13:18] <duch_kazatel> Minty you just record what the last action was.  not sure why you're resetting anything.
[17:41:50] <ZeuZ> shouldn't $('#buttonID').off() remove something that was given in document.ready with .on() ?
[17:42:03] <t4nk664> does anyone know what a + sign means in the middle of a jquery selector.  for example:
[17:42:03] <t4nk664>      $(gall + ' .whiteImage').first().appendTo(gall);
[17:42:16] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ that'll remove all event listeners on that node iirc.
[17:42:25] <duch_kazatel> t4nk664 that's adding those as a string.
[17:42:30] <duch_kazatel> concat
[17:42:33] <t4nk664> thx
[17:42:49] <ZeuZ> something's wrong then, fulldownloads.webege.com --> I've broken something else that keeps
[17:42:51] <ZeuZ> oh wait
[17:44:01] <ZeuZ> something that was given to a button through onClick='troublesome_function()' won't be removed through .off() right?
[17:44:44] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of.
[17:44:58] <ZeuZ> how can I remove that?
[17:46:23] <duch_kazatel> .attr('onClick', '') maybe?
[17:51:41] <ZeuZ> lemme try
[17:53:04] <ZeuZ> yay =D
[17:53:22] <duch_kazatel> any way you can remove those inline event handlers/
[17:55:47] <ZeuZ> what you suggested worked like a charm
[18:01:00] <JBlitzen> If I have a function "func()", what's the syntax to call it for each ".cl" selector return and have "$(this)" be recognized inside it?
[18:01:16] <JBlitzen> I was going toward $(".cl").each(...func();...);
[18:01:19] <JBlitzen> But that seems roundabout
[18:49:09] <motaka2> how to append data
[18:52:53] <tw2113> .append()
[18:58:16] <t4nk664> what does it mean to open a function with !
[18:58:17] <t4nk664> !(function ($, window, undefined) {
[19:04:45] <randomdev> Would anyone be able to help me stop the animatescroll script conflicting with the prev and next slide controls? http://www.bootply.com/116752
[19:26:42] <barryhjames> Can you do an autocomplete linked to a PHP class, or do you have to link it to a document (example: something.php)?
[19:30:15] <Cheekio> When I get a jquery object, can I assign it arbitrary functions, and then call it later and use them?
[20:51:01] <checkit> Can anyone here help me with a regex pattern to search a string for matches up to 4 numerical numbers with this pattern /1234x1234
[20:51:24] <checkit> String could also be /123x123 or /12x12 or /123x12 etc...
[21:10:20] <pragma-> I could, but what's in it for me?
[21:11:16] <pragma-> What's my motiviation?  What's my incentive?  Inspire me.
[21:24:56] <angelazou> hi, I would like to hook an event to an element, then change its state (for which there is another event) and when that state is changed, hook the original event again
[21:27:09] <angelazou> I have a demo here http://jsbin.com/sicoj/1/edit
[21:28:19] <angelazou> sorry this one instead
[21:28:20] <angelazou> http://jsbin.com/sicoj/2/edit
[21:28:44] <angelazou> problem is, the second time, it doesn't hook the event anymore. I'm guessing because it really means one time when it says .one
[22:13:53] <anli> Is it possible to create an img from binary image data?
[22:14:02] <anli> You have to do a data url of it?
