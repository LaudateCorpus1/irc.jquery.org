[00:10:48] <sh4sh4nk> Hi Everyone !
[00:13:51] <sh4sh4nk> Quite new to Jquery though. I am trying to debug an issue with my code with chrome developer tools. in one of the statements for(var i in this.items) -- i is undefined as seen while debugging.
[00:14:24] <sh4sh4nk> What could be possibly wrong here ?
[03:31:41] <Audlex> how do i remove only text from a div? such as <div>some text<span>other text</span?</div> but only removing "other text"?
[03:32:06] <arc_> sounds like you want to remove text from the span, not the div
[03:32:43] <Audlex> in the actual div it is an image wrapped in an a tag
[03:33:13] <Audlex> so i just want to remove the equivalent of 'some text'
[03:33:26] <arc_> is it text or an image
[03:33:40] <arc_> jquery doesn't deal with html as text
[03:34:16] <Audlex> just text
[03:34:22] <arc_> so what is the actual html
[03:52:32] <jak2013> i friends. how to do: when page load, i query somemething with ajax(extract some data from the db) and draw something...
[03:52:46] <jak2013> my question is: how to do same operation, every 1 minute or 2?
[05:51:27] <Abhijit> hi
[05:51:43] <Abhijit> anyone knows good icheck alternative? my icheck radio buttons are not visible in rails production. tried everything.
[05:56:06] <YeaRight> how do i stop currently running animation and do another one right away?
[05:56:22] <YeaRight> i have an animation that comes in when the navbar is fixed on the top
[05:56:42] <YeaRight> but when the user suddenly scrolls up the animation is still not done and waits for it
[06:19:20] <Guest31044> a client wants me to finish an animation at the same time with a scroll navigation. how do i do that?
[06:20:22] <Guest31044> it's a one page site and he wants the animation to finish when the user is on the section he wants after clicking on the nav link
[06:20:57] <Guest31044> anyone please?

[12:28:17] <GrundeLL> Hello
[12:29:08] <GrundeLL> Quick question, been looking at the docs for jquery.ui slider and cant figure how to preset the slider values as an array() of values. is this possible
[14:29:52] <geri> hi, how can i overlay a <div id="dialog" on to a canvas?
[16:02:06] <z1haze> fadeOut() and fadeIn() just toggle opacity, right?
[16:04:18] <z1haze> i have this function here http://dpaste.com/2390YYK thats supposed to fade in my preloader when a user clicks to refresh a div, and then fade it out after its done, but nothing is happening, the chart is updating, but the .preloader-container stays at opacity: 0
[16:12:54] <shoky> z1haze: fadeIn also toggles display:none, won't work if you set the opacity to 0 yourself.  you can use .fadeTo instead.  best to use css transitions though
[16:13:31] <z1haze> ok well i set it to display: none by default then and left the opacity alone, still no dice
[16:13:50] <shoky> why not css transitions
[16:13:54] <z1haze> looking at the console inspector thers no properties animating when i click
[16:14:03] <z1haze> what do you mean? im showing a preloader on aclick
[16:14:17] <z1haze> just use show/hide?
[16:15:22] <shoky> i mean css transitions ;p   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions
[16:15:48] <z1haze> yea i know what a css transition is, i just dont understand how youd be using it here...
[16:15:49] <shoky> just put css transitions in your css,  and then in js you just addClas/removeClass/toggleClass
[16:15:52] <z1haze> im show/hiding a div
[16:15:54] <z1haze> ah
[16:16:04] <z1haze> what difference does it make
[16:16:28] <shoky> it's simpler and much more performant (especially on mobile)
[16:16:32] <z1haze> ok
[16:17:55] <iDentity> [ { id: "7", username: "test", steam_id: "STEAM_0:0:13121337" } ] -> Since this is my only object in JSON, how can i fetch it without using $.each
[16:18:00] <iDentity> since i need this data in socket stuff
[16:18:25] <iDentity> do i put everything inside a $.each function or can i just fetch these 3 values without $.each?
[16:19:01] <z1haze> i must be fking something up.. its not doing anytyhing to that element
[16:19:06] <z1haze> even when im toggling the class now
[16:19:17] <shoky> z1haze jsfiddle
[16:19:32] <z1haze> can i just push this into productin?
[16:19:44] <shoky> iDentity:  you can just get the object that's at index 0 in the array
[16:20:07] <z1haze> im loading data and stuff from my server and its all csrf protected
[16:20:13] <z1haze> it will be a pain to fiddle
[16:20:38] <shoky> z1haze:  adding a class and setting css is not loading data and csrf stuff. but as you wish, keep complaining ;p
[16:20:59] <z1haze> ha wel i meant theres a graph in play
[16:23:30] <z1haze> shoky, can i send u link
[16:23:56] <shoky> ok
[16:24:24] <z1haze> the result button in the graph module
[16:25:05] <z1haze> it has to be an issue with my selector because nothing is changing
[16:25:54] <z1haze> ah i didnt realize what a nightmare it was after browserify got to it, nevermind
[16:28:34] <shoky> graph module?
[16:29:08] <z1haze> here is isolated example https://jsfiddle.net/fo45pabo/
[16:29:23] <z1haze> clicking refresh should show that preloader but it isnt
[16:29:52] <shoky> umm it causes an error, check your console
[16:30:00] <z1haze> well yea because thers no graph etc
[16:30:01] <iDentity> @shoky, yeah that worked, but i didn't figure it out completly
[16:30:04] <z1haze> but it should still show that
[16:30:09] <shoky> z1haze so that's not an example of your problem
[16:30:13] <shoky> and not helpful
[16:30:14] <z1haze> no
[16:30:30] <z1haze> well i gate you a live link but the js file is a mess because browserify
[16:30:38] <iDentity> So, outside of $.getJSON, when i execute this:     socket.on('connect', function(user) {         socket.emit('adduser', user); });
[16:30:42] <iDentity> it returns null
[16:30:43] <iDentity> to the server
[16:30:44] <shoky> then get your shit together and come back later when you have a real testcase ;p
[16:30:49] <shoky> stop wasting our time ;p
[16:30:56] <z1haze> damn
[16:33:48] <kevireilly> iDentity: not sure the default `connect` event has any arguments
[16:35:06] <iDentity> I think i figured out my problem
[16:35:11] <iDentity> I can't use these variables
[16:35:13] <iDentity> outside a function.
[16:36:20] <iDentity> I'll just put everything inside that callback
[16:36:23] <iDentity> of .$getJSON
[16:44:21] <iDentity> Can I store username and steam_id in array with socket.emit?
[16:44:29] <iDentity> and then use it later again
[16:50:08] <z1haze> can you have a callback to addClass?
[16:50:24] <z1haze> $('el').addClass('shown', function() { ... ?
[16:57:35] <z1haze> i need to toggle opacity and display but still have a transition
[17:19:53] <z1haze> if you delcare a variable like var myVar = $(this); do in order to user jquery again on that variable for i have to do $(myVar).closest('.div') or can i just do myVar.closest()
[17:20:46] <z1haze> like this:
[17:20:47] <z1haze> var el = $(this).closest('.box');
[17:20:47] <z1haze>         refreshWidget($(el).find('.content'), $(el).attr('id'));
[17:21:47] <shoky> z1haze: if you have a jquery object, wrapping it with $() is redundant and shouldn't be done
[17:22:01] <z1haze> so what i just posted is redundant?
[17:22:19] <shoky> is el a jquery object?
[17:22:33] <z1haze> uh
[17:22:37] <z1haze> z1haze> var el = $(this).closest('.box'); ?
[17:22:46] <shoky> is that a yes or a no?
[17:22:53] <z1haze> im asking..
[17:22:58] <shoky> me too.
[17:23:03] <z1haze> its just an element on the page
[17:23:11] <z1haze> what makes it a jQuery object
[17:23:18] <shoky> elements on the page are not jquery objects
[17:23:26] <z1haze> ok so i do need to wrap it in $() then
[17:23:28] <z1haze> thanks
[17:23:29] <shoky> but el is not just an element in the page
[17:23:42] <shoky> it's a jquery object. because .closest returns a jquery object, as the docs say
[17:23:48] <shoky> as do most jquery methods like that
[17:23:58] <shoky> so yes el is a jquery object
[17:26:23] <iDentity> i'll probably ask again since my message got lost
[17:26:44] <iDentity> Can I store both username and steamid into array and use them again when needed?
[17:26:55] <iDentity> i need them in socket.emit
[17:42:27] <geri> hi, why is the text not formatted correctly for the following message dialog? the dialog opens when you click in the moving rectangle https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/11/
[18:02:00] <geri> why is the text not formatted correctly for the following message dialog? the dialog opens when you click in the moving rectangle https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/11/
[18:02:07] <geri> no jquery users here? :D
[18:17:27] <iDentity> no socket.io users here? :r
[18:36:11] <iDentity> can i add elements to objects?
[18:36:26] <iDentity> like add them on event?
[18:38:48] <zzaichik> How would I write this? $(this, '.nav').toggle(..); ?
[18:39:00] <zzaichik> to target both this and another element
[18:40:29] <zzaichik> .add()
[18:40:33] <zzaichik> okay thanks, me!
[18:41:40] <iDentity> xd
[18:52:13] <geri> hi how can i add a input text for the dialog used here? http://jsfiddle.net/DYbwb/597/
[19:41:30] <iDentity> Anyone here have experience with socket.io ?
[20:09:06] <jak2013> iDentity socket.io is for?
[20:09:16] <iDentity> websockets
[20:09:21] <iDentity> framework
[20:09:22] <iDentity> kind
[20:16:38] <jak2013> explain more pls , have a sample?
[20:18:12] <quiznilo> any tips on how to send a json object to a client on initial page load?  I can pass json back fine on AJAX calls, but strangely enough, not on initial page load
[20:18:22] <quiznilo> and google is failing me
[20:18:30] <iDentity> So basicaly, sockets.io is a websockets framework. You set up a server, clients connect to it and communicate through the server in real-time
[20:18:56] <jak2013> is for chat?
[20:19:05] <iDentity> Actually, a matchmaking system
[20:19:13] <iDentity> but similar approach.
[20:19:25] <quiznilo> someone once wrote a chat app as an example of sockets, and now everyone thinks websockets are only useful for chat apps >.<
[20:20:04] <iDentity> they're useful for bunch of stuff :D
[20:20:49] <quiznilo> hell yeah!  I wrote a websockets front-end for corona
[20:20:53] <quiznilo> sonofa...
[20:21:02] <quiznilo> a websockets front-end for GDB, though unfinished
[20:21:10] <iDentity> planning on finishing it ?
[20:21:21] <quiznilo> the guy who requested it decided he didn't need it
[20:21:31] <iDentity> finish it for yourself
[20:21:33] <iDentity> for the pleasure :D
[20:21:44] <quiznilo> https://github.com/quiznilo/corona I didn't get far
[20:21:55] <quiznilo> I will, eventually, buried under other projects atm
[20:22:06] <quiznilo> and this dumb json on initial page load
[20:24:49] <quiznilo> $.ajax() calls work fine, they download the json and I can attach the js object anywhere using .data()
[20:25:46] <quiznilo> I want to attach some user data to the page on initial page load though... $("body").data("UserData", <something here>);
[20:26:31] <quiznilo> if I just send the byte slice, like I do for ajax, I just get a bunch of numbers
[20:27:14] <quiznilo> if I send a json string, that's just what I get, a string there that looks like json, but isn't an object
[20:27:20] <iDentity> :r
[20:27:55] <iDentity> wait
[20:27:57] <quiznilo> parseJSON(); possibly... but
[20:28:01] <iDentity> you are trying to append the data from JSON
[20:28:04] <iDentity> into the website?
[20:28:14] <quiznilo> 'attach' it, not 'append'
[20:28:20] <quiznilo> using .Data()
[20:28:23] <iDentity> hmm
[20:28:33] <iDentity> I know you can use $.getJSON to fetch it
[20:28:45] <iDentity> which is almost same as $.ajax with type JSON
[20:29:04] <iDentity> sounds to me that your JSON is not formatting properly.
[20:29:10] <quiznilo> yes, I can do that fine, but this isn't an $.ajax() call, it's just on page load
[20:29:34] <quiznilo> json formatting is fine for ajax calls
[20:29:40] <iDentity> no idea then
[20:29:41] <iDentity> sry
[20:29:43] <D-rex> quiznilo: gist it
[20:29:53] <quiznilo> let me look more at .getJSON()
[20:30:31] <quiznilo> not much to gist, just `$("body").data("UserSession", "{{ .SessUser }}");`
[20:30:43] <quiznilo> that's a go template
[20:31:31] <quiznilo> yeah, .getJSON is related to ajax, it wants a url
[20:32:08] <quiznilo> I'm going to try $.parseJSON({{ .SessUser}}) in there
[20:32:57] <quiznilo> and send it as a byte slice
[20:39:18] <quiznilo> well, $.parseJSON(""); works, as I thought it would
[20:39:36] <iDentity> Does anyone know what's the best way to generate lobbies on socket.io
[20:39:38] <iDentity> for a game matchmaking system
[20:39:52] <quiznilo> if I stringify it at the server first... I don't have to stringify the return for ajax calls though
[20:39:55] <iDentity> just need to create a new room for each 10 players (unique room ofcousre)
[20:55:55] <N00B_S> hehey all

[22:07:17] <DarkElement> I am trying to get a nearby <input type="hidden"> with jquery, however whatever method I use it just returns undefined. Is there a common mistake i'm making?
[22:08:14] <jak2013> DarkElement you need an id to hidden element
[22:08:39] <DarkElement> I shouldn't...
[22:08:51] <DarkElement> I should be able to do siblings().find(".someclass")
[22:09:03] <DarkElement> or at least closest("input")
[22:10:01] <jak2013> the hidden element is on a table?
[22:10:55] <DarkElement> No, why would it be
[22:12:29] <jak2013> have a fiddle?
[22:13:55] <DarkElement> No, I fixed it myself.
[22:54:05] <DarkElement> When I try and fadeIn("slow") an input, it always does it immediately. What am I doing wrong?
