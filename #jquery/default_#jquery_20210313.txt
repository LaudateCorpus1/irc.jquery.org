[15:57:42] <JohnDoe2> if someone has an idea if the "chosen" plugin sets input width to exact pixel dimension inline, please let me know. I can't find it but the HTML itself has a custom width inline style
[18:24:06] <Braden`> Hello!
[18:27:04] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/FqCxt6Qi <--- I am getting:  ReferenceError:  $ is undefined   however, I am fairly certain that given my load order, it should be fine.  I verified in the Network developer tab of my browser that the jquery file is loaded'
[18:49:34] <Braden`> Anyone?
[19:00:49] <pavonia> Is jQuery defined?
[19:03:09] <Braden`> Isn't that what line 1 does?
[19:05:14] <pavonia> I mean if you use "jQuery" instead of "$", just to make sure
[19:05:47] <Braden`> You mean like:   JQuery(document).ready(function() {   ?
[19:06:19] <robertmaxrees> try jQuery.fn.jquery Braden`
[19:06:40] <robertmaxrees> if that works but $.fn.jquery doesn't, then it sounds like something is turning on noconflict.
[19:07:24] <Braden`> Hmm weird
[19:07:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:07:29] <Braden`> Says JQuery is undefined
[19:07:36] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery
[19:07:39] <robertmaxrees> lowercase j.
[19:08:10] <robertmaxrees> also: is your network tab showing a 200 for the library file itself?  or some other status?
[19:08:35] <Braden`> 200 for the library file
[19:09:04] <robertmaxrees> weird.  and there aren't any js errors on the page?  even seemingly unrelated ones?
[19:11:33] <Braden`> jquery-3.6.0-min.js:2:37883  -->    Uncaught TypeError: E.createElement(...).SetAttribute is not a function
[19:11:46] <robertmaxrees> and that comes before the $ is undefined error?
[19:11:52] <Braden`> Yes
[19:12:19] <robertmaxrees> are there any other JS files on that page?  are you able to share a link to the page in question?
[19:13:33] <Braden`> Its just my local machine.  No other js than the ones in the paste.   jquery-3.6.0-min.js, jquery.serializeObject.min.js, and index.js (the last file being mine).  They are loaded in that order.  I also commented out serializeObject file to see if that changes anything.  It still has the same error
[19:13:57] <robertmaxrees> what if you comment out the other js file and leave just the min jquery file?
[19:14:24] <robertmaxrees> also: how did you download that copy of jquery? :)
[19:14:29] <Braden`> Still the same
[19:14:37] <Braden`> I can try redownloading the jquery library
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> how'd ya download it tho?
[19:16:50] <Braden`> right-click download link as
[19:16:58] <Braden`> re-downloaded.  Testing
[19:16:58] <robertmaxrees> from where tho?
[19:17:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:17:06] <Braden`> https://jquery.com/download/
[19:17:21] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yeah, might be worth clicking link, ctrl+a, ctrl+c, etc.
[19:17:44] <robertmaxrees> wondering if there's a probelm with something like linebreaks or encording.
[19:17:47] <robertmaxrees> *encoding
[19:18:32] <Braden`> Redownloading fixed it
[19:18:38] <Braden`> I suspect encoding probably
[19:18:38] <robertmaxrees> killer.
[19:18:51] <Braden`> Are you one of the developers of jquery?
[19:18:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:19:00] <Braden`> Oh
[19:19:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:19:21] <Braden`> I was going to suggest a zip or other compressed file to avoid the encoding issues
[19:19:38] <robertmaxrees> most folks are using something like npm these days :)
[19:20:01] <robertmaxrees> can file a suggestion in the jquery cdn repo if you'd like.
[19:20:49] <Braden`> I am sure they thought of it before :)
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> also possible you just have a fluke experience.
[19:24:47] <Braden`> Well thank you for the assistance.  Walking through it helped me solve it
[19:26:24] <robertmaxrees> def!
