[09:20:52] <TheWild> ...okay, never mind. I think I'll solve the thing the other way.

[14:58:46] <Minnebo> HI
[15:01:05] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:20:14] <taplar> what a tease
[15:25:05] <robertmaxrees> lel
[15:25:38] <taplar> i think this is the shortest monday log i've ever seen
[15:25:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, been super quiet so far.
[15:27:51] <SideFX> I'm using this wp_localize_script function from wordpress to try to modify datepicker's options.  It seems I need to know what object to pass an array to for options?
[15:29:16] <Minnebo> : D
[15:29:39] <Minnebo> Sorry for tease but I wasn't sure I shouldve posted my question here in the first place. But here it goes
[15:31:02] <Minnebo> I have a faulty module on wordpress (yay) the support can fix it, but whenever I edit the form, the plugins gets updated it bricks. The issue is that sometimes the input elements on my huge form become disabled, this could happen after 20 questions in the form, sometimes after 30, sometimes it doesn't happen. Their solution is to never edit the form and don't update the module.
[15:31:21] <Minnebo> I did not like that fix for obvious security reasons :)
[15:32:08] <Minnebo> When I edit the HMTL of the page (in the frontend with inspect element) I can just remove the disabled state, fill in the textarea of checkbox and continue
[15:33:00] <Minnebo> So I started googling \o/ and I was pointed in this direction jQuery. This should be enough --> $(":input").prop('disabled', false); to fix all the fields. But where should I place this line of code? :>
[15:33:59] <taplar> at what point does the elements become disabled?
[15:36:18] <Minnebo> taplar, well that is the fun.. I have a form with 43 pages. It occurs randomly. I can start 5 times from scratch, fill in random data, and sometimes it fails on question 30, 31, 32, 37
[15:37:10] <Minnebo> I have a shorter form as well (29 pages) and there is never an issue
[15:37:16] <taplar> but does it happen after some specific kind of interaction, even if it's sporatic?
[15:37:35] <taplar> like a page change or something
[15:37:56] <SideFX> i feel bad for whoever has to fill out that form
[15:38:29] <Minnebo> sometimes it is me, that is why I want to fix it, but it seems harder then I thought it would be :)
[17:16:51] <Minnebo> jquery guys
[17:17:05] <Minnebo> I fixed it
[17:23:10] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:39:27] <Minnebo> i'm not gonna log off
[17:40:22] <Minnebo> I need to get this results with jquery
[17:40:23] <Minnebo> <button type="button" class="button-submit" onclick="fm_submit_form('7');">Submit</button>
[17:40:35] <Minnebo> the onclick action is missing for some reason
[17:40:45] <Minnebo> is this possible? thanks in advance
[17:55:48] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[17:57:02] <jak2000> hi all
[20:25:00] <RyansWorld> Hey guys can you give fadeToggle() property to an entire class that is essentially a table with several rows and columns?
[20:25:25] <RyansWorld> I have a button and when clicked i want it to remove the entire table which I did with display="none" but i want that transition to fade it out.
[20:26:59] <RyansWorld> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ecFoXesd/
[20:27:26] <RyansWorld> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eOudPoX2/
[20:28:01] <RyansWorld> all that code toggles it off and on, I just cant get the transition animation to fade it.  When I try to add toggleFade etc it doesnt work.  Im probably approaching it the wrong way?
[20:28:49] <RyansWorld> avag and evang is the button im clicking on
[20:38:48] <webdude_> RyansWorld, assuming fadeToggle "watches" opactiy like the normal toggle watches display:none, I would assume this would work: https://pastebin.com/03WfRLzY
[20:46:02] <RyansWorld> ill it work if there is no css file for it?
[20:48:34] <RyansWorld> you know what
[20:48:43] <RyansWorld> im using the slim version of jquery i bet that is the problem
[20:50:30] <RyansWorld> oh man that is what i was doing wrong
[21:03:51] <webdude_> it should work even without CSS assigned to it, but you could also just set the CSS via jquery when it triggers document ready
[21:04:04] <webdude_> *if it needs it
