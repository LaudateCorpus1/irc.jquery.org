[01:54:14] <Xitry> Hi guys, I have a question
[01:54:21] <Xitry> $(".js-box").on("mouseleave", (event) => {
[01:54:21] <Xitry>             event.currentTarget.find("img").prop(
[01:54:21] <Xitry>                 "src",
[01:54:21] <Xitry>                 event.currentTarget.find("img").data("hover-src")
[01:54:21] <Xitry>             );
[01:54:38] <Xitry> After transpiling ,t
[01:54:43] <Xitry> it*, I get: Uncaught TypeError: a.currentTarget.find is not a function
[01:54:57] <Xitry> Isn't event.currentTarget equals $(this)?
[01:55:12] <Xitry> Cause $(this).find("img").prop("src") works properly
[01:57:06] <rcyr> Xitry: event.currentTarget is not a jQuery object, it's a good old DOM node, you need to rewrap it so you can use .find on it.
[01:57:37] <Xitry> jQuery(event.currentTarget).find you mean? rcyr
[01:58:35] <rcyr> Yup.
[01:59:43] <Xitry> Worked. Thanks :)
[02:16:32] <wpast> hello from this past: http://pastebin.com/d0gX7XvP can anyone tell me why the second set is not being output?
[02:24:58] <printForever> After page update, I guess Ajax update, there is a new element on the page. I've wrote a line of code to remove that element, but it only works when I run it through console.
[02:25:05] <printForever> Is there any way I can intercept the page update?
[02:25:16] <printForever> I tried ajaxComplete, it does not work :(
[02:29:58] <printForever> MutationObserver = window.MutationObserver || window.WebKitMutationObserver;
[02:43:00] <hellyeah> so
[02:43:16] <hellyeah> map has three feature
[02:43:43] <hellyeah> 1- you can iterate 2- you can return something 3- map will transform what you iterate into object
[02:43:54] <hellyeah> is there something else i should know about?
[04:20:51] <hellyeah> yo
[04:21:01] <hellyeah> anyone here knows about datepicker?
[04:30:20] <hellyeah> that sucks
[05:34:21] <TheGuest> in a form wizard how to stop the enter key from submitting the form unless it is on the last step already?
[05:35:32] <Xatenev> TheGuest: set the button disabled and on load of the last step remove the disabled attribute?
[05:36:00] <Xatenev> Oh the enter key
[05:36:59] <TheGuest> it has no submit button on the first step. the submit button is on the last step
[05:37:27] <TheGuest> but people is used to press the enter key
[05:37:39] <Xatenev> so check for event.keyCode==13
[05:37:44] <Xatenev> then event.preventDefault();
[05:38:00] <TheGuest> soo... instead of submit i want it to go to the next step then if last step... enter would submit
[05:38:45] <Xatenev> http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/jquery-multi-step-form-with-progress-bar
[05:50:36] <TheGuest> meh, that does not have what im looking for hahaha

[06:54:46] <jop008> any help on this small question http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2016-03-08_at_12.30.13-udal4si2.png I have an object how to refer to 20: offferte ingangsdatum verstreken? object is ostatus
[08:26:38] <km4> hi
[08:27:28] <km4> if I have attr('transform', 'scale(0.5) rotate(5)') can I use only for rotate removeAttr or somethings ?
[08:36:35] <decx> you'll always have to manage strings
[08:38:36] <PSan> how to submit disabled inputs?
[08:38:55] <decx> dont disable them
[08:39:05] <taplar> :)
[08:39:09] <PSan> lol
[08:39:34] <PSan> yeah I guess it's not worth it to try and do something complicated to achieve something simple
[08:40:17] <taplar> just enable them before you submit
[08:40:51] <taplar> or keep a paired hidden field that you set the value on when the paired field is disabled, *shrug*
[08:41:25] <decx> got away with just using poitner events none in an internal app
[08:42:13] <taplar> o_O
[09:06:50] <sigdk> when I do an ajax call, can I also set somewhere url parameter variables ? Shall I write url : "foo?myvar=123" or does it go elsewhere ? I have code in front of me that uses data field to write it like this:  data: { 'myvar' : '123' }
[09:07:27] <taplar_afk> you want both url params and body params?
[09:08:01] <decx> it goes into data
[09:09:08] <hellyeah> so there is three things i need to know about map
[09:09:40] <hellyeah> 1- you can iterate array or jquery object 2- you can return something 3- the thing that map return will be transformed to jquery object
[09:09:45] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[09:10:00] <taplar> 'can' is strange
[09:10:04] <taplar> it will and should
[09:10:22] <taplar> #3 is not accurate
[09:10:41] <hellyeah> my  bad english
[09:10:43] <taplar> $.fn.map will return a jquery object, $.map or Array.prototype.map will not
[09:10:49] <hellyeah> why #3 is not accurate
[09:10:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:11:01] <hellyeah> pardon me
[09:11:09] <sigdk> taplar, hmmm... I guess I want body params. So, it goes to data. How can I pass both a body param and some data gathered from a form ?  Is data: { 'myvar' : 123, $('#myform').serialize() } valid ?
[09:11:23] <hellyeah> $JQuery.map return arrayand $('..').map return jquery object
[09:11:43] <taplar> sigdk: I believe there is a serializeObject method you can use on a form
[09:11:51] <taplar> then you can add whatever extra you need to that
[09:11:56] <taplar> then give that object to data
[09:11:57] <decx> you can just create a query object and send that as data
[09:12:13] <sigdk> decx, wrap everything in it ?
[09:12:22] <decx> data is just an object
[09:12:33] <decx> ajax will do all the legwork for you
[09:12:35] <hellyeah> isnt data a attribute?
[09:12:56] <taplar> the value is an object
[09:13:17] <hellyeah> ic
[09:13:51] <decx> so { blah: [0,1,2], test: 'a', more: { ok: 1, then: 2}} beomces ?blah[]=1&blah[]=1&blah[]=3&test=a&more[ok]=1&more[then]=2
[09:14:34] <sigdk> so, this is valid:  data: { 'myvar' : 123, $('#myform').serialize() }, correct ?
[09:14:43] <hellyeah> too bad jquery doesnt have smnt like >> or b>
[09:14:45] <decx> no
[09:15:07] <decx> serialize creates its own object
[09:15:18] <decx> what do you expect this to do
[09:15:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  $.map  or $something.map you can append the dom returned value in both
[09:16:06] <hellyeah> i will think about that today
[09:16:12] <hellyeah> it is really easy logic
[09:16:52] <sigdk> decx, to bundle all the form parameters, plus myvar together and send them to the backend
[09:17:04] <decx> yeah but serialze creates an object
[09:17:17] <decx> and you put this object just as a new property
[09:17:32] <taplar> var formObj = $('#myform').serialize();  formObj.myvar = 123; then send the formObj with data
[09:17:39] <decx> extend your serialized obj with your extra data
[09:17:57] <sigdk> hmm... I see
[09:18:02] <decx> or that, but extend would be safer
[09:18:49] <sigdk> decx, how do I extend it ?
[09:19:03] <decx> jquery has extend
[09:19:19] <sigdk> doesn't it have the same effect if I append the script url part with '?myvar=123' ?
[09:19:35] <decx> sure, enter maintenence hell
[09:20:17] <sigdk> decx, I see... thanks for the clarification guys
[09:29:23] <ExtraSteve> If I make an ajax call with a data parameter called 'mystuff' and I set it to true (boolean, not a string)
[09:29:34] <ExtraSteve> Is there a way to extract it as a boolean value in php?
[09:29:40] <ExtraSteve> or do I have to parse it as a string?
[09:30:01] <ExtraSteve> and do a: $mystuff = $_POST['mystuff']=='true' ? true : false; ?
[09:30:16] <slax0r> ExtraSteve: var_dump($_POST['mystuff']);
[09:30:18] <slax0r> see what type it is
[09:30:46] <ExtraSteve> I'm gonna be mad if it's a bool
[09:31:41] <slax0r> it's not...
[09:34:10] <decx> you're always gonna pass strings
[09:34:52] <ExtraSteve> fair enough
[09:35:01] <decx> better than passing gas at least
[09:36:32] <shoky> sigdk: serialize() returns a string,  maybe you want serializeArray()  and then add an item to the array
[09:40:22] <decx> oh right serializetoobject is just a helperfunction i have
[09:40:27] <decx> derp
[09:41:30] <shoky> dat decx.js
[09:42:26] <decx> it's got reduce in it... future!!
[09:42:52] <hellyeah> taplar:  still there?
[09:43:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  any further suggestion? http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/2/
[09:43:55] <decx> isnt there #checkmyapp or something ^^
[09:43:56] <taplar> busy at the moment
[09:44:19] <taplar> and there are other peeps too
[09:44:36] <decx> *slowly backs out of the room*
[09:44:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  okey thank you
[09:45:11] <hellyeah> decx:  he gave me some suggestion couple of days ago
[09:46:08] <decx> i'm sure he regretted it after you went back to the 500 line fiddles
[09:46:49] <hellyeah> decx:  it is not constructive
[09:47:27] <taplar> he worked through most of it.  i just haven't hand a chance to make another pass yet
[09:47:39] <decx> agreed, not separating problems into easy to digest parts is not constructive ;)
[09:47:51] <hellyeah> :D
[09:48:20] <hellyeah> work on small parts make it big
[09:48:26] <Ackis> From another channel: Keep http://xyproblem.info and http://sscce.org in mind when problem solving
[09:48:46] <hellyeah> but these three suggestions he made made an real inpact
[09:49:00] <hellyeah> i cannot colorized date range about six months now
[09:49:07] <hellyeah> it took 3-4 secs
[09:49:10] <hellyeah> thats amazing
[09:49:19] <decx> thanks to map?
[09:49:33] <hellyeah> map belongs to dropdown
[09:49:54] <hellyeah> i mean browser didnt redraw dropdown again and againn
[09:50:00] <hellyeah> also i cached selectors
[09:50:08] <decx> anyway if you like jquerys map you should read up on the other higher order functions from native
[09:50:18] <decx> reduce, filter and the native map
[09:50:29] <hellyeah> $.map and .map
[09:50:48] <hellyeah> decx:  also sometimes i did global lookup
[09:50:56] <decx> i guess sort could count as well
[09:51:02] <hellyeah> he warned me about that
[09:51:07] <hellyeah> sort
[09:51:10] <hellyeah> array sort?
[09:51:24] <decx> these are all for arrays
[09:52:13] <hellyeah> map is also for jquery object?
[09:53:04] <decx> well it's array like
[09:54:09] <hellyeah> hmm yes
[09:55:22] <hellyeah> is array an object?
[10:10:08] <ifohancroft> hello everyone. I am having a select dropdown in html and I am trying to get the data-key and the .text() of the selected option. How should I do it? I was doing it using (#filters select).on('click', 'option' function) etc but it seems it doesn't work in Chrome
[10:10:34] <ifohancroft> I am trying with on change but I have to remove the option part but then it gets everything when I only need the click option
[10:12:28] <Ackis> alrighty - today I want to learn how to create an extension or plugin - figured I'd try something easyish and come up with something that adds the source URL as a parameter: https://jsfiddle.net/Ackis/ggmrfmfa/ is what I've gotten from tutorials/google but it's not quite working
[10:21:05] <decx> ifohancroft: you can use :selected
[10:21:20] <decx> either in your selector or for filtering your options
[10:22:07] <ifohancroft> oh yeah, something like on click or on change on the select to get the values of its children option that is :selected?
[10:23:47] <ifohancroft> tnx, didn't thought of that, i'd try it out
[10:26:09] <ifohancroft> works so far
[10:34:32] <ifohancroft> tested in both chrome and firefox, now downloading firefox (forgot to test during development :S)
[11:09:04] <AL13N_work> is there a way to have a fallback selector?
[11:09:18] <AL13N_work> like: if the current selection is empty, try this one instead?
[11:09:48] <decx> the || operator
[11:11:04] <AL13N_work> i was hoping something like: $('#someid").or('#someotherid')
[11:11:26] <taplar> you can do '#someid, #someotherid'
[11:11:33] <taplar> but that won't tell you if someid didn't exist
[11:11:40] <decx> oh wait || doesnt work on empty jquery collections because it's not technically empty
[11:13:33] <decx> i'd say give them a common class
[11:41:00] <scribble> is there a way to disable the other buttons in a form I didn't click?
[11:41:20] <robertmaxrees> why would you need to do that?
[11:42:30] <scribble> I have a group of buttons 'YES' 'NO' and 'NA' if the user clicks YES I want NO and NA to become disabled robertmaxrees
[11:42:48] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a radio group instead?
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> since that's basically what you want anyway :)
[11:44:18] <scribble> i suppose robertmaxrees
[11:52:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:52:55] <sigdk> Hello, here is a simplified version of my code: https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/29/ I'm using this validate plugin: http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/  and I want to submit my data to the backend with an ajax request and fetch a response. Where exactly do I do this ? In submitHandler just call $.axaj({ ... success: }) ?
[11:54:00] <r3v3rb> hi all, i have this: https://jsfiddle.net/xarfd1sb/1/ <- I need to set the textarea to wrap when the text in the p>span does any help appreciated its for a little charity
[11:54:01] <robertmaxrees> sigdk basically.
[11:54:06] <MDTech-us_MAN> hello, I have a string that contains an entire html document. how can I add an element to the beginning of the <head>?
[11:54:33] <robertmaxrees> MDTech-us_MAN use .find() and .prepend()
[11:54:54] <robertmaxrees> MDTech-us_MAN though you can't really make use of that string as a document so i'm not sure why you'd want to do that.
[11:55:17] <MDTech-us_MAN> how to I do it to a string and then get a string back
[11:55:42] <robertmaxrees> MDTech-us_MAN you don't - you manipulate it as a jquery object and then use .html()
[11:56:09] <decx> does that really work?
[11:56:19] <decx> with <html> and everythng
[11:56:25] <robertmaxrees> probably.  don't see why it wouldn't.  this example is kind of strange tbh.
[11:56:27] <r3v3rb> scribble: are you using bootstrap 4 - it has that functionality in its form elements…
[11:56:41] <r3v3rb> you could take a look how they handle it
[11:56:58] <MDTech-us_MAN> and to get a jquery object, i would do `$('<html></html>')`
[11:57:10] <robertmaxrees> MDTech-us_MAN sure - why are you trying to do that though?
[11:57:26] <taplar> typically you don't put an entire document in a jquery object
[11:57:58] <robertmaxrees> right, and you don't normally have a string that is an entire document.
[11:58:45] <MDTech-us_MAN> $('body', $('<html></html>')).append($('<div>blah</div>)
[11:58:51] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[11:58:53] <MDTech-us_MAN> would that work
[11:59:03] <robertmaxrees> you alreayd have a page.
[11:59:12] <robertmaxrees> what's the context here?
[12:00:06] <MDTech-us_MAN> I get a string that has an html document from the backend and need to do some modifications before I put it into a textarea
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> why are you putting an entire document into a textarea? and why not do these changes server-side?
[12:01:10] <r3v3rb> https://jsfiddle.net/xarfd1sb/2/ << anyone? :P
[12:01:14] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like i was wrong.
[12:02:01] <robertmaxrees> you can't edit full documents like that with jquery.  might be able to use a documentfragment in raw JS to do it.
[12:02:14] <decx> it eats tags doesnt it
[12:02:16] <MDTech-us_MAN> I need to put it into a textarea to show it to the user. I can't do it server-side because the changes depend on what the user selects on the page
[12:02:20] <robertmaxrees> decx yep.
[12:02:32] <robertmaxrees> MDTech-us_MAN you're in for a world of hurt on this one.
[12:02:38] <decx> regex head and put stuff in there
[12:02:40] <decx> ^^
[12:02:42] <robertmaxrees> editing an entire document like that is difficult.
[12:02:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha ewwwww.
[12:03:42] <decx> r3v3rb: you want to count lines?
[12:03:56] <robertmaxrees> he wants to wrap the span when the textarea wraps.
[12:04:08] <decx> wat
[12:04:13] <r3v3rb> decx, it does that I need to return the wrapped text from the span into the textarea as linebreaks
[12:04:54] <r3v3rb> decx, if a user types a long line the p>span will wrap, I need the textarea to add a \n\r so that the lines used will stay in sync
[12:04:55] <decx> wouldnt that look weird with the textarea being so small?
[12:05:18] <r3v3rb> decx, thats just the fiddle the correct width is wider
[12:06:06] <r3v3rb> in fact its the full width of the containing div in the responsive design
[12:07:01] <r3v3rb> https://jsfiddle.net/xarfd1sb/3/ is closer to the final output
[12:07:55] <r3v3rb> type a long single line of text, the ‘preview’ will wrap but the text area stays a single line and the lines used will still show 1 of 6
[12:09:38] <r3v3rb> or https://jsfiddle.net/xarfd1sb/3/#&togetherjs=VUld4izAe8
[12:10:09] <decx> yeah i get it, but it's not as interesting as i thought, good luck tho ^^
[12:10:43] <r3v3rb> decx thanks
[12:12:09] <adavia> Anybody knows is the jquery ajax form http://malsup.com/jquery/form/ sets headers automatically?
[12:12:41] <robertmaxrees> adavia what do you mean? which headers?
[12:13:41] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i need to pass a token using something like beforeSend but the plugin does not seem to use that option
[12:14:12] <robertmaxrees> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#options-object
[12:14:33] <robertmaxrees> "Note: Aside from the options listed below, you can also pass any of the standard $.ajax options to ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit."
[12:14:51] <adavia> ohh
[12:14:55] <adavia> havent read that part
[12:14:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could probably pretty easily just do without this plugin since it doesn't look like it really adds much, but you use beforeSubmit like you would otherwise.
[12:15:33] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i am using the plugin for ajax uploads
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> of files?
[12:15:41] <adavia> yes
[12:16:08] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[12:17:20] <adavia> i think is the best plugin i found to deal with file ajax uploads
[12:55:31] <sigdk> Any idea how to close the leanModal() inside the submitHandler ? https://jsfiddle.net/j0anos49/1/
[12:55:58] <sigdk> I also get an error when the page loads at console... I don't know why
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[12:56:56] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, well... it says: "Uncaught Error: Error connecting to extension cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb"
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an issue with a plugin.
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> andit looks like lean modal doesn't offer a nice api, so you'll need to trigger click on the overlay or something.
[13:00:04] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, when I trigger click, it closes and reopens
[13:00:16] <robertmaxrees> wat.
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> dunno then - i'd have to see it break.
[13:26:50] <arc_> haha omg this sound effect https://www.airconsole.com/ ... volume warning
[13:28:01] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaa
[13:51:44] <netcrime> Hello, I have a tree of checkboxes Parent checkbox > Child check box etc. How can I uncheck all children boxes if parent was unchecked?
[13:52:08] <taplar> how are they related in the dom?
[13:52:52] <taplar> or is this a (un)check all checkbox type situation?
[13:57:20] <netcrime> taplar_meeting: the relationship https://dpaste.de/oinj
[13:57:40] <netcrime> They are parent has <ul> inside
[14:11:50] <jonascj> Hi all. I have this html http://pastebin.com/ZuUwn6E6 which is basically just 3x <input> and 3x <div> which gets populated with the results obtained from inputting things into <input> via ajax.
[14:12:24] <jonascj> How can I best make it so that [tab] cycles the three <input> exclusively, regardless of whether the 3x <div> gets populated with an image and a link?
[14:24:43] <arc_> welp i was about to answer that guy's question but now he's gone
[14:52:17] <taplar> netcrime: ok, so given your html, if you check the parent which ones should be checked?
[14:52:31] <netcrime> children

[14:57:03] <taplar> so logically
[14:57:04] <netcrime> I need that if Parent is checked all children would be iterated and data-id collected to Array siteids
[14:57:13] <robertmaxrees> give those parent LIs a class.
[14:57:38] <robertmaxrees> and/or those parent checkboxes.
[14:57:40] <taplar> when the parent is checked or unchecked, you want to find the parent li, then find the children checkboxes, that are not the parent, and make their checked match the parent's checked state
[14:59:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/
[15:00:00] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[15:00:01] <netcrime> taplar actualy no Parent checkbox - Region, Children cities. IF parent checked I need all children attribute data-id (id's of cities)
[15:01:10] <netcrime> Actualy I dont need it check. Now my problem is how to iterate all children of parent and collect data-id attributes
[15:01:26] <taplar> his fiddle already shows how to find them
[15:01:30] <taplar> you can map off of that
[15:01:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:01:55] <taplar> you don't have to do the iteration, let jquery do that
[15:02:07] <decx> shouldnt the powered and unpowered only be used to group select their child inputs
[15:02:09] <taplar> avoid the boiler plate!
[15:02:24] <robertmaxrees> decx that's what my fiddle does :)
[15:02:54] <decx> well clicking two wheeled should hceck powered
[15:03:06] <decx> and deselecting every child should deselect the parent too
[15:03:07] <taplar> maybe, :)
[15:03:08] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't sure that's what he wanted.
[15:03:10] <decx> UX !!
[15:03:14] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/1/
[15:03:17] <taplar> maybe that's not in his AC, :)
[15:03:30] <decx> ^^
[15:03:45] <taplar> but i'd agree
[15:04:17] <taplar> then again, i'm a fan of the select all methodology like gmail has
[15:05:27] <netcrime> robertmaxrees thats probably what i need but as it is my first day getting in to javascript I dont understand all you code but thanks anyway i think ill figure out from there
[15:05:37] <taplar> first day?
[15:05:45] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a good place to start for jquery help.
[15:05:47] <taplar> learn.jquery.com try.jquery.com
[15:06:22] <taplar> oh crap
[15:06:29] <taplar> we're teaching javascript to netcrime
[15:06:52] <netcrime> hean
[15:07:20] * taplar calls the feds
[15:07:34] <netcrime> yeah first day.. i started django project then thought it would be great to make some ajax product showing and one thing led to another im learning javascript and jquery :)
[15:08:30] <netcrime> lol dont worry i wont use javascript for internet crimes :D
[15:08:37] <taplar> they all say that
[15:09:23] <awkwardCough> so long as you just dont admit to internetway imescray
[15:09:57] <taplar> you should really get that cough looked after dude
[15:10:04] * awkwardCough 
[15:10:32] <netcrime> :D
[15:13:44] <netcrime> robertmaxrees thanks i cracked your code and thats what i need
[15:14:14] <taplar> see, already cracking code
[15:14:17] <netcrime> cracked because im netcrime ofcourse
[15:14:23] * netcrime awkwardCough
[15:14:34] * awkwardCough 
[15:14:43] <taplar> it's like an evil guys calling card
[15:14:46] <taplar> we know you did it!
[15:14:51] <taplar> of course......i'm netcrime
[15:15:00] <awkwardCough> unless its reverse psychology
[15:15:16] <taplar> elaborate?
[15:15:39] <taplar> heh, he's ignoring me now
[15:16:51] <awkwardCough> if everyone thinks hes doing the netcrime then no one is watching the taplar doing the real crime is what i mean
[15:17:17] <taplar> lol, that's not reverse psychology, though, that'd just make him a patsey
[15:18:56] <netcrime> Like jessica fletcher movies were everyone thinks at the begining the BAD one is BAD and turns out its that old lady across the street killing all those people.. same with taplar and me
[15:19:15] <taplar> who's the old lady here?
[15:19:56] <netcrime> you.
[15:19:58] * netcrime awkwardCaugh
[15:20:18] <taplar> if i'm going to play this role, i need a ton of cats
[15:20:27] <taplar> there's someone named cats?
[15:20:30] <taplar> *sigh*
[15:24:33] <taplar> and no one named dogs
[15:24:36] <taplar> that's racist
[15:25:06] <awkwardCough> *speciest
[15:28:14] <geri> hi, why i cant see any output here? https://jsfiddle.net/msdank2f/ ...is jquery not added as a external ressource?
[15:29:00] <netcrime> I had to get back to my crimes
[15:29:11] <netcrime> I mean rimes, rimes...
[15:29:23] <netcrime> rhymes
[15:29:53] <netcrime> yo yo i write jquery like a ferry
[15:32:12] <nivyaj> hey
[15:32:37] <taplar> aloha
[15:33:09] <geri> wrong paste...right one: https://jsfiddle.net/wLg4h6en/
[15:33:39] <nivyaj> I have a dialog window, and I want the focus to go to the last element in the window. I have  multiple <tbody><tr><td>
[15:33:55] <nivyaj> is there a way to get the very last tr, in all those tables?
[15:34:16] <taplar> you could use tr:last
[15:34:19] <nivyaj> $( "tr:last" ) does not work
[15:34:26] <taplar> or $('tr').last()
[15:34:36] <taplar> but you need to do it with context to the dialog
[15:34:49] <nivyaj> $('tr').last().focus ?
[15:35:06] <taplar> do you have an id or class on the dialog window?
[15:35:41] <nivyaj> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/SYiOkpRC/
[15:35:48] <nivyaj> taplar: ^
[15:36:26] <taplar> so whatever $(this).next('.helpDialog') is
[15:36:55] <taplar> store that in a var and do the find for the tr off of it
[15:38:36] <decx> geri: you cant use function expressions before you declare them
[15:38:56] <geri> how can i centralize the object? https://jsfiddle.net/d930rkv3/
[15:40:13] <nivyaj> like this taplar ? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KzzzXo
[15:40:27] <nivyaj> i'm sorry, i'm hacking through this.
[15:40:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pkk2vnvn/1/
[15:40:55] <decx> geri: take out the like where it sets the margin
[15:40:59] <taplar> though iirc non input elements are only focusable if they have a tab index on them
[15:41:34] <decx> *line
[15:49:44] <geri> decx: ok i see, is it possible to place 2 canvas on each other?
[15:50:28] <decx> you can just render to a shadow canvas and pull image data from that in your other canvas
[15:52:19] <netcrime> I need it to return data-id value of Bicycle and Skateboard but code just doesnt want to work.. https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/1/
[15:52:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:52:54] <robertmaxrees> that's what that does.
[15:54:40] <netcrime> sorry its your example wrong paste
[15:54:53] <netcrime> https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/2/
[15:54:59] <netcrime> I tryed to remake your code into my
[15:55:02] <nivyaj> taplar: can you walk me through what you did, so i understand it?
[15:55:22] <robertmaxrees> aaaaa
[15:55:24] <taplar> hold on
[15:55:27] <robertmaxrees> netcrime this is... woah.
[15:55:29] <nivyaj> thanks :)
[15:55:39] <netcrime> very bad?
[15:55:43] <robertmaxrees> confusing?
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> also: you have a js error.
[15:55:56] <decx> i called the suicide hotline and mailed them that fiddle
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[15:55:57] <robertmaxrees> fix that.
[15:55:58] <decx> they told me to do it
[15:56:15] <robertmaxrees> siteids = $(this).parent.find('input').map(function() { is where the error is.
[15:56:29] <netcrime> mmm chrome console doesnt show any error
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> yes it does :)
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> open it and reload the pase, then click a box.
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> *page
[15:56:54] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pkk2vnvn/2/
[15:57:35] <netcrime> oh
[15:57:39] <netcrime> yeah it does
[15:58:22] <netcrime> mm it almost works
[15:58:34] <netcrime> why does it returns 1 2 3 1
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> netcrime hit up fixingthesejquery.com
[15:59:03] <robertmaxrees> it'll teach you how to debug.
[15:59:07] <robertmaxrees> it's a good slideshow.
[16:00:36] <netcrime> ok
[16:04:12] <docmur> If my url is http://blah/foo/bar/index.php  how do I set the URL I want to redirect to, to be https:/blah/foo/bar/  without writing that into the localhost object
[16:05:34] <geri> decx: i have this issue, i want to have the triangle moving without the shadow compared to the rotating green line... https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/
[16:05:50] <geri> so i thought i create 2 canvas...
[16:06:02] <robertmaxrees> docmur you'd need to reconstruct it through the props on window.location.
[16:06:04] <geri> the moving triangle into the second canvas...
[16:06:18] <decx> you mean without the blur
[16:06:22] <geri> yes
[16:06:33] <geri> the blur is created in the clear function
[16:06:46] <geri> for the rotating green line... but it also effects the white triangle
[16:06:54] <decx> yeah it's the low alpha fill rect trick
[16:07:01] <decx> for fading effect
[16:07:10] <geri> which trick?
[16:07:24] <decx> every frame you fill the whole canvas with a low alpha colour
[16:07:31] <decx> that creates a cheap fading effect
[16:07:45] <geri> can you show it in the fiddle?
[16:08:54] <decx> it's probably best if you do try it with 2 canvases
[16:09:40] <geri> decx: which are overlapping?
[16:09:50] <decx> you can try and render the radar with the whole fading in a virtual canvas and then pull out the image data to draw as a single layer on your output canvas
[16:10:05] <decx> but unless you wrote the rest of all that yourself that might be a bit too complex
[16:11:43] <geri> decx: oh really?
[16:11:51] <geri> too complex?
[16:12:15] <decx> yeah it's a whole ordeal
[16:18:08] <decx> geri: so getting ahead?
[16:18:13] <geri> decx: how would you solve it?
[16:18:26] <decx> well i already solved it
[16:18:33] <decx> like i described
[16:18:37] <decx> ^^
[16:18:54] <geri> decx: the low alpha colour trick?
[16:19:03] <netcrime> How to make it return only id's of Bicycle and Skateboard? https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/4/
[16:19:06] <geri> or two canvases?
[16:19:08] <decx> no that's the reason why you have to separate it
[16:19:12] <decx> yes two canvases
[16:19:17] <decx> let me move stuff around for you
[16:19:33] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/1/
[16:20:08] <geri> decx: magic!
[16:20:16] <decx> i changed radar to be a created canvas and use canvas as the output
[16:20:27] <decx> because all the functions use ctx to render to that context
[16:20:33] <decx> and i'm not gonna change all that
[16:20:34] <decx> ^^
[16:20:56] <decx> so we define width and height for our newly created radar shadow canvas
[16:21:01] <decx> next in animate()
[16:21:20] <decx> after draw() is done rendering its stuff to the invisible radar canvas
[16:21:33] <decx> we clear our output canvas with black
[16:21:39] <decx> the draw the radar
[16:21:51] <decx> and just then call the object drawing functions
[16:21:53] <taplar> netcrime: line 8 is setting the array to be all the ids
[16:21:58] <decx> where i changed ctx to outputctx
[16:21:59] <decx> done
[16:22:01] <decx> ^^
[16:22:15] <taplar> then ln 13 is adding the parent again
[16:23:54] <netcrime> oh.. stupid mistake but how do I iterate only throu children and leave parent alone
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> .find('thechildren')
[16:24:16] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:24:16] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> how do you have a collection of both?
[16:25:22] <netcrime> what collection ?
[16:25:44] <netcrime> siteids = $(this).parent().find('child-checkbox') doesnt work
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> "but how do I iterate only throu children and leave parent alone" implies that you have an object you're running .each() on
[16:25:58] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[16:27:26] <netcrime> im not running .each() im running your code .map(function() {
[16:27:26] <netcrime>     	return $(this).data('id');
[16:27:26] <netcrime>     }).get();
[16:27:39] <robertmaxrees> then show me your fiddle.
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> also: please don't multiline paste into the channel :)
[16:28:04] <netcrime> https://jsfiddle.net/epkrbkx9/5/
[16:28:08] <netcrime> sorry that was accident
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> right, so did you check out the debugging tutorial?
[16:28:51] <netcrime> Yes and im using chrome console to see for js errors
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> but did you get tot he part about using console.log()?
[16:29:23] <netcrime> yes that is the best debugger
[16:29:27] <netcrime> or something like that
[16:29:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:29:34] <robertmaxrees> it's better than using alerts()
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> and your issue is that you're doing $(this).parent().find('input') - if you just want the children, use .closest('.tree').find('.child-checkbox') or something.
[16:30:36] <sdubois> the following snippet of code runs fine on Chrome and Safari. Doesn't work at all on FF. Any ideas why? http://pastebin.com/3GqkwJNg
[16:30:47] <netcrime> hmm let me check
[16:31:17] <robertmaxrees> sdubois which part specifically?
[16:31:22] <robertmaxrees> because that should work fine.
[16:32:00] <sdubois> it's not running at all
[16:32:10] <sdubois> if i put a print statement at the top of the function
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> no error messages?
[16:40:04] <robertmaxrees> because it works for me in ff.
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> also: should really declare body outside of the handler: https://jsfiddle.net/14toz3w3/1/
[17:28:17] <mad_moses> hey guys, is it legal to remove the copyright informations in my jquery.js source?
[17:29:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jquery.org/license/
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> "You are free to use any jQuery Foundation project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact."
[17:33:39] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: okay :/
[17:33:46] <robertmaxrees> mad_moses why?
[17:34:44] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: try to get 100/100 in google pagespeed. And google wants to remove all comments from my javascript files.
[17:34:57] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:35:03] <robertmaxrees> that's such a small concern - i wouldn't worry about it.
[17:36:07] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: I know, but would be nice to get 100/100
[17:36:17] <robertmaxrees> nah, i wouldn't worry about it.
[17:36:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:36:50] <taplar> do you get a performance upgrade with 100/100?
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> think of pagespeed as more of a suggestion - 100/100 is unattainable.
[17:39:02] <mad_moses> I've red that google is using this results for ranking. So I tried to score well
[17:40:18] <taplar> look at it this way.  all those other sites that are using jquery are leaving the license in there files too
[17:40:40] <robertmaxrees> mad_moses it's not as big of an impact as you think it is.
[17:40:43] <robertmaxrees> good content is #1
[17:40:49] <robertmaxrees> far and away.
[17:41:39] <mad_moses> taplar: nope, some are removing this files, but you are right. I don't care anymore what google is telling me
[17:41:50] <robertmaxrees> mad_moses you should care about their content guidelines.
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> and by doing the best you can with the pagespeed stuff.
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> but don't fixate on it too much.
[17:42:32] <mad_moses> okay thx
[17:43:03] <robertmaxrees> hell my company is at like 73/100 and our reps at google don't really talk about pagespeed very much sooo.
[18:23:45] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[18:45:21] <MacWorks> Hello.
[18:45:27] <robertmaxrees> hullo!
[18:46:02] <MacWorks> Any way to get jQuery.fn.validateForm = function() {...} to call an already defined jQuery.fn.validateForm = function()? I'm looking to extend the checks the first one performs.
[18:46:48] <robertmaxrees> you want to extend/override it.
[18:46:53] <MacWorks> I have a workaround where jQuery.fn.validateForm = function() checks for jQuery.fn.extendedFormValidator, but it seems like it could be a little cleaner if I could just extend/add additional functionality to the primary one.
[18:47:09] <robertmaxrees> but you're replacing the function, so not really.
[18:47:14] <robertmaxrees> not without storing a reference to it.
[18:47:21] <MacWorks> I don't want to replace it, I want to add another function to it
[18:47:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid overriding like that.
[18:48:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just give it a new name?
[18:49:03] <MacWorks> So I can't do something like jQuery.fn.validateForm = {jQuery.fn.validateForm; additional checks that are specific to a specific form}
[18:49:32] <MacWorks> Honestly it's because it's more lines of code, more to remember, etc.
[18:49:40] <robertmaxrees> you could probably cook something up, but overriding methods like that is generally something to avoid.
[18:49:53] <robertmaxrees> because now you're changing out what that method does from under people.
[18:50:01] <MacWorks> I'm not looking to override it, I'm looking to extend it.
[18:50:14] <MacWorks> Only in one view, only for one form.
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> right, which is ill advised :)
[18:50:28] <MacWorks> I'm not changing what it does, I'm trying to add to what it does.
[18:50:35] <robertmaxrees> which is the same as changing it.
[18:50:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:51:10] <MacWorks> Alright well it's working now but I have to use two separate names. It's not that big of a deal. Just wondered. Thanks.
[18:53:02] <MacWorks> One thing that bugs me is that I have to add the function to jQuery as a whole. I'd prefer to just add it to the form element but cannot seem to get that to work.
[18:53:23] <MacWorks> It makes no sense that .validateForm is a method on any object when it only applies to forms.
[18:53:56] <robertmaxrees> that's how inheritance and jquery work.
[18:54:56] <robertmaxrees> the jquery object would need to store that method somewhere for constructors anyway, y'know?
[18:55:20] <MacWorks> Yeah but the DOM is loaded and I want to attach a function to specific element. But whatever.
[18:55:45] <MacWorks> One of these days I'll move away from jQuery but I have too much going to figure that out. I'm doing everything from front-back on a very complex app.
[18:55:49] <robertmaxrees> some libraries do something like that with an initializer.
[18:55:52] <MacWorks> 3 years into it so far.
[18:57:19] <MacWorks> Anyway, thanks again.
[20:03:04] <docmur> I want to grab all the data in a table row, when I click a button which in the last <td> of the row.  if I have something like: https://jsfiddle.net/Larb0z8p/ how do I do it?
[20:03:24] <robertmaxrees> .cloest('tr') is probably what you want.
[20:03:51] <robertmaxrees> well, .closest('tr').find('td') will get you all TDs.
[20:04:50] <docmur> Yep, that's exactly what I wanted!!! Thanks :D
[20:56:46] <LurkAshFlake> "Data is not defined" http://pastebin.com/USaBA8M1 is it because I didn't installed json?
[22:09:23] <Shai-Tan> how does jquery properly do if( isset( response.foo ) )?
[22:09:54] <Shai-Tan> more properly.. how does jquery properly do if( isset( response.errors ) )?
[22:15:08] <BenderRodriguez> Shai-Tan: JS question :)
[22:15:51] <BenderRodriguez> I usually do if (typeof response.errors !== 'undefined')
[22:19:43] <Shai-Tan> ok, will do, thanks

[22:46:47] <rafajafar> hiya, sooo I'm doing some super fun/funky stuff with DOM manipulation in Selenium by embedding jQuery. I'm actually comparing two documents' rendered/generated HTML in-browser and adding the "deltas" as CSS classes if there's a difference between the two.
[22:47:17] <rafajafar> The idea being that I run the page with adblock on, then I run it again with adblock off, and I use that to determine where the advertisements are on the page
[22:48:51] <rafajafar> so, obviously I'm doing some in-memory DOM stuff with one of the documents. The problem I'm running into is I'm checking to see if any elements are hidden that werent before. is(":visible") wont work b/c it's in-memory. However I thought .css("display") == "none" would work, but it doesn't! The root <body> tag keeps getting flagged as being turned hidden, and it's not in reality.
[22:49:01] <rafajafar> does anyone have any inkling what could be going on there?
[22:49:11] <rafajafar> sorry brb kettle
[22:52:10] <rafajafar> back, any ideas?
[22:54:28] <b4b> i dont completely follow but .find will allow you to search elements that havent been attached to the dom i believe
[22:54:42] <b4b> :visible obviously wont work
[22:55:53] <rafajafar> yeah, b4b, it's a weird approach, sorry... so the problem is... well here: http://pastebin.com/QwJDjLGw
[22:56:24] <rafajafar> the "body" tag of the unattached element is always saying it's "display: none" even though it's not
[22:57:08] <rafajafar> start at the bottom of that code to see how it's invoked
[22:58:37] <rafajafar> oh mtJQ() == $(), renamed it to prevent conflicts by using window.mtJQ = $.noConflict(true);
[23:01:45] <b4b> I think elements that are not attached to dom are never considered visible
[23:02:27] <rafajafar> right, so :visible wont work... but why does .css('display') on line 12 return true
[23:03:10] <b4b> again it’s not part of the dom so there is no display
[23:03:52] <b4b> css doesnt apply to non dom elements
[23:04:25] <rafajafar> b4b, ewwww... hmmmm
[23:04:40] <rafajafar> b4b so it'll just say null?
[23:08:11] <b4b> i dont get why a body is detached?
[23:08:50] <rafajafar> b4b ok, the problem I'm working on is detecting advertisements in a web page
[23:09:23] <Shai-Tan> i have a php script which returns json encoded multi dimensional array to my jquery ajax call. how do I itterate over this array? eg: response.errors.each( function(index, value){..
[23:09:56] <rafajafar> b4b so I render a page with adblock ON, then I get its source, then I render it again, but this time with adblock OFF... and I pass the blockON into the page that has blockOFF and check for differences. One of the differences I need is newly hidden elements
[23:11:02] <b4b> cant you addclass to the element when it’s still atached and visible or not visible?
[23:12:17] <rafajafar> well again, I'm looking for differences. If pageA.elementX is visible but pageB.elementX is not visible, the adblocker hid that element. I need to keep one in memory.
[23:12:46] <rafajafar> if I added pageB to pageA, then the styles injected by the adblocker impact pageA
[23:13:35] <b4b> sorry dude i dunno, all i can see is checking visiblity of detached elements isnt gonna work
[23:13:37] <rafajafar> if they were all inline styles this would be no problem, I guess, but there are styles added via style tags
[23:14:00] <rafajafar> b4b I'm just surprised that detatched elements have "display: none"
[23:14:46] <rafajafar> b4b I didn't expect line 12 to return true for the body tag, yanno?
[23:15:14] <b4b> try vanilla js and see if jquery is calculating the “none"
[23:15:27] <rafajafar> b4b k
[23:15:53] <rafajafar> wait can I do vanilla js on detatched DOM?
[23:16:07] <b4b> sure jquery is just a wrapper
[23:17:21] <rafajafar> b4b... wait, I got an idea... a frame is basically a sandbox... I can just put both documents in a frame and then compare that way, right?
[23:18:10] <b4b> i would assume so as long as there both attached
[23:18:47] <rafajafar> b4b word, I'll give it a shot, thanks for being my sounding board for a bit
[23:30:50] <bernard__> Hi, Does anyone here use Google Apps Script?
[23:31:23] <bernard__> No one here? What? Too early or too late?
