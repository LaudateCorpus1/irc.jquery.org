[02:32:23] <al_nz1> Evening people
[02:33:53] <al_nz1> I am looking at this code: http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/dynamic-form-fields-add-amp-remove-bs3 - what does this notation controlForm = $('.controls form:first') mean? I know $('.controls selects the class - what about the form:first ?
[02:34:39] <Cork> al_nz1: :first is a jquery extension, it is the same as $('.controls form').first()
[02:35:00] <al_nz1> What does it mean?
[02:35:08] <Cork> what do you think?
[02:35:39] <al_nz1> I have no idea lol - thats why I asked
[02:35:57] <Cork> if you make a query for elements, and then run .first() on that result?
[02:36:10] <Cork> what is the first thing you can think of it means?
[02:36:21] <Cork> *it could mean
[02:36:38] <al_nz1> ok so your selecting the first element
[02:36:47] <Cork> exactly
[02:36:48] <al_nz1> whats the relevance of 'form' though?
[02:36:58] <Cork> its a normal css selector
[02:37:12] <Cork> .controls form {}
[02:37:38] <al_nz1> not sure I follow, I thought we're dealing with HTML here
[02:38:04] <Cork> jquery uses querySelectorAll to ask the browser to search the dom
[02:38:15] <Cork> and its syntax is what you write in css files
[02:38:49] <Cork> so no, it isn't a custom query language, it is just normal css selectors
[02:40:24] <al_nz1> are you able to relate the explanation back to the example on the webpage?
[02:40:31] <al_nz1> so its a selector
[02:40:46] <al_nz1> obvioulsy controls class
[02:40:47] <Cork> you know how css works right?
[02:41:02] <al_nz1> yes it applies tyles
[02:41:04] <al_nz1> styles
[02:41:15] <Cork> and you know how you target what is styled?
[02:41:28] <al_nz1> yip
[02:41:46] <Cork> then you should know what this does
[02:41:52] <Cork> cause it uses the EXACT same syntax
[02:41:58] <Cork> only difference is it is wrapped in $('')
[02:43:26] <al_nz1> so css and jquery selectors are the same?
[02:43:43] <Cork> ... that is what i just said yes
[02:44:32] <al_nz1> ok
[02:44:45] <al_nz1> I admit I am not familiar with all the css selectors
[02:46:35] <al_nz1> in fact if I google css form:first the results dont seem relevant
[02:47:03] <Cork> uh... i told you what :first was already...
[02:47:46] <Cork> al_nz1: have a read at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[02:48:56] <Cork> and after that have a look at the jquery extensions at http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[02:49:31] <al_nz1> thanks I will take a look
[02:52:43] <al_nz1> so the english translation of that selector is class controls, match against decendants form, and get the first result?
[05:43:06] <sinopia> Hi, I got a select in a dropdown with some functions in jQuery that it hides the options that the product doesn't have. But in iOS and Safari/macOS it display all the options rest of browsers/OS's it works well, anyone knows why it happens?
[05:54:13] <AdamPDotty> Thats a bit little information to go on.
[05:54:22] <AdamPDotty> How do you "hide"?
[06:08:37] <sinopia> the select options are inline-block and depending the attributes of the product it set the ones that doesn't have to display: none
[06:09:12] <sinopia> it works nice it Windows and Android in a lot of browsers (all that I tested it worked)
[06:09:40] <sinopia> when I try in iOS and Safari(macOS) it display all options even if they're suppossed to be hidden
[06:36:46] <jquery218> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-scroll-position
[06:53:11] <Cork> sinopia: you can't use display: none on options tags
[06:53:24] <Cork> sinopia: <option> is a replaced element so css rules don't apply
[06:53:33] <Cork> (and no it isn't just safari that breaks this)
[06:53:46] <Cork> the only option is to remove the element from the dom list
[06:53:54] <Cork> (that is cross browser compatible)
[06:58:57] <sinopia> I don't have much skills, got some jQuery functions most of them are hide/show when products are selected, how can I do that Cork?
[06:59:29] <Cork> sinopia: well you either just replace everything with a stored html blob
[07:00:25] <Cork> or you do something like var originalOptions = $('#the-select option').clone();
[07:01:32] <Cork> and when you plan to change the list do $('#the-select').html(originalOptions.filter('selector matching only the options you want to keep'));
[07:01:41] <jquery218> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-scroll-position
[07:01:51] <Cork> sinopia: correction you don't need .clone in the first line
[07:02:03] <Cork> jquery218: please stop spamming links
[07:02:05] <sinopia> well, I don't know how to explain this because the code here isn't mine, this connects to the database and only shows in the select the avaliable options of the products and display: none the ones who don't exists
[07:02:28] <jquery218> spam links per 5  20 min ?
[07:02:30] <Cork> ya, and that is what you need to fix
[07:02:42] <Cork> jquery218: if you just send a link one is spam yes
[07:02:50] <jquery218> lol
[07:02:54] <Cork> if you have a question, ask it
[07:03:09] <jquery218> i ask in forum this question!
[07:03:19] <jquery218> this link is my question
[07:03:21] <Cork> then wait there, and stop spamming in here
[07:03:31] <jquery218> this is not spam in chat
[07:03:33] <jquery218> per 20 min!
[07:03:43] <Cork> it is still pointless, so == spam
[07:03:51] <jquery218> pfff
[07:35:55] <sinopia> Cork, I'd made a function that check the options in the select if they're "display: none;" to $(this).remove(); and it works (not 100% fine but it only shows the inline-block)
[07:49:28] <codecutter> why i'm i getting a match on 'holden caufield' with regex "name.match('[\d*,]'))" when there is no digit?
[07:49:38] <lemonsparrow> hi.. I have a usecase where I want to show differnet form with textfields based on what options user choses between 2 options.. so can I have a toggle kinda button to chose based on which form changes.. is there something similar for reference available ?
[07:51:29] <codecutter> why i'm i getting a match when there no digit in string regex 'holden caufield'.match('[\d*,]')) ?
[07:54:34] <r3ply> maybe because it's matching the *
[08:13:48] <AdamPDotty> 'holden caufield'.match(/[\d*,]/)
[08:14:50] <AdamPDotty> the backslash got lost in string interpretation
[08:16:10] <AdamPDotty> maybe 'holden caulfield'.match('[\\d*,]')
[08:24:33] <manoj__> Hi, isn't there be a meeting on #jquery-meeting at this time https://meetings.jquery.org/
[08:29:43] <mike_papa> Can someone explain to me, why inside function in $obj.each(function (index, $element) {}) $this has .children method, and $element doesn't? Shouldn't they be the same?
[08:30:01] <mike_papa> $(this)*
[08:30:45] <mike_papa> "More importantly, the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword this refers to the element." - from jQuery docs.
[08:30:48] <Cork> mike $element == this
[08:30:51] <Cork> not $(this)
[08:30:58] <Cork> so $($element) == $(this)
[08:31:06] <mike_papa> Oh... ok.
[08:31:18] <mike_papa> Thanks.
[08:40:38] <JosefDe> Is it somehow possible to set history state for a specific page and remove all it's previously stored history states?
[09:10:07] <ZoderUck> who uses here ES2013 ?
[09:12:32] <ZoderUck> o
[09:12:36] <ZoderUck> apparently nobody
[09:29:21] <snufft> would someone mind doing some hand-holding for a moment? When I see this in chrome dev tools (the expanded $.fn.init[1] part), what exactly am I looking at? It's a javascript object, i'm guessing, but what do the parts (aside from length) mean? Is it flat javascript or is it specifically jQuery?
[09:31:54] <snufft> and how do I work with it? I see lines of code running things like .append(), so I know you can mess with it at a basic javascript level, but tbh i'm used to the most basic of jQuery based manipulation, like messing with the actual html on the page
[09:32:32] <snufft> even a link to a guide would be awesome :)
[09:37:21] <sam-lap> hi guys anyone can help me out build an check for enable an button just when the user check all radios on the page ?
[09:41:41] <AwkwardCough> sam-lap you would probably want to have an event that trigger on the click of radio that checks if all radios have been filled out... if so enable the button, if not just continue as usual
[09:51:22] <sam-lap> AwkwardCough jquery not my strong, can you give me an example ?
[09:52:32] <MassDebates> If you're trying to require certain fields before a form submission, you can do that with HTML and the native browser functions behind it sam-lap
[09:53:40] <MassDebates> but if you have to use jquery for some reason or whatever, then an easy way for you to learn about jquery while completing the task would be an exercise of linking the elements to a series of variable values and then you can run a checksum at the end! Heh, remember doing that one in school..
[09:54:28] <MassDebates> Or, if you're looking to do it with CSS and whatnot, you can do something a bit more of a crude nature and swap out some classes based upon the radio button states.
[09:54:36] <MassDebates> Heck, you can do it with JUST css!
[09:54:53] <AwkwardCough> ^ mostly good but scared me with the css
[09:56:00] <MassDebates> I'm just trying to work against the effort that people are pushing for now with the whole 'JQUERY ALL THE THINGS!' - I think we provide a much better value by offering multiple solutions with variance in tech, principle, philosophy, and creativity.
[09:56:48] <MassDebates> when sam-lap starts asking about them, i'll then tell him about the issues without doing it with best standards in mind and I'll show him the values of why he should do something a certain way vs doing it another way.
[09:57:10] <AwkwardCough> That is absolutely fair lol always look for the best way to do something... not just the quickest
[09:57:20] <MassDebates> I think it's much better than if i were to shoot him a link and let him run off on his own immediately. He may end up with a bad solution that I could have warned him about
[09:57:26] <MassDebates> yeah
[09:59:30] <AwkwardCough> though im curious about the css solution, would that swapping of classes bassed on states end up needing a jquery to evaluate them?
[10:21:56] <MassDebates> AwkwardCough:  I was going to show him both!
[10:22:33] <MassDebates> AwkwardCough:  I was going to show him the more 'crude' solution first- using CSS states to handle a covering element's opacity * click-through properties.
[10:23:09] <taplar> i'm more interested in the use of radios in this case vs checkboxes
[10:29:38] <MassDebates> taplar:  Elaborate
[10:30:13] <taplar> his statement was about determining when all radio buttons are checked.  typically radios have a default option checked and radio's don't become unchecked.
[10:30:23] <taplar> so it's a bit strange
[10:32:01] <hlve> ...r danger?
[10:32:09] <hlve> stranger danger.
[10:32:50] <taplar> :o comedy bretheren!
[10:33:15] <hlve> =)
[10:38:28] <MassDebates> taplar:  sorry, i was afk for a moment
[10:38:49] <MassDebates> taplar:  and radio buttons certainly can have a default, but many don't have one!
[10:39:30] <MassDebates> taplar:  I find this is even more frequently found to be true on forms that involve things like a gender to be identified. I don't see "male" selected by default as per usual.
[10:40:07] <taplar> sure.
[10:41:16] <taplar> i'm all about the default though, to reduce the validation that you have to do, :)
[10:42:20] <taplar> in any case, original guy hasn't followed up so, *shrug*
[10:53:28] <sam-lap> i've this that works for one radio button
[10:53:29] <sam-lap> https://jsfiddle.net/f8t8bf8z/
[10:54:04] <sam-lap> and now if i want to only enable the button when all radios enabled ? what should be the best way ?
[10:56:24] <taplar> what have you tried?
[11:00:26] <hlve> sam-lap, Meh... https://jsfiddle.net/f8t8bf8z/1/
[11:00:49] <hlve> it's ugly
[11:01:00] <hlve> heck. I'm kinda ugly.
[11:01:05] <hlve> I blame pnumonia.
[11:09:09] <sam-lap> kinda hacky but it works :)
[11:09:12] <sam-lap> thanks
[11:10:17] <taplar> you had the check for one.  what gave you trouble with extrapolating it for 3?
[11:11:33] <hlve> taplar, because he wasnt checking if the state of the checked.
[11:11:46] <taplar> his selector took care of that
[11:12:28] <taplar> yah, he wasn't doing any conditional
[11:12:56] <taplar> :/
[11:14:27] <hlve> you don't really even need the else in that if switch sam-lap, you can't uncheck the radios ;p
[11:17:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/f8t8bf8z/2/
[11:18:05] <hlve> showoff
[11:18:06] <hlve> :P
[11:18:36] <hlve> oh that's so much cleaner.
[11:18:57] <taplar> i was going to take the route you did at first, but then i thought of the length check
[11:19:36] <taplar> and it only has the initial lookup, ^_^
[11:19:49] <taplar> well, fk, and the button
[11:21:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/f8t8bf8z/3/
[12:15:41] <Alturic> Hey guys, I'm trying to use ajax success: function(response, value) { }  I'm trying to access the response (json) and I'm trying to check if a key is set, if ($(response[0] == "updated")) { //do something } seems to fire all the time though?
[12:16:24] <robertmaxrees> show some code?
[12:16:41] <robertmaxrees> also:  if ($(response[0] == "updated")) looks.... weird.
[12:16:54] <robertmaxrees> why are you padding that to the jquery constructor?
[12:16:59] <robertmaxrees> *passing
[12:17:26] <Alturic> Well that's kinda how I know it's not working correctly. The way it stands right now response is literally a string, and even at that "updated" isn't contained in the string.
[12:17:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> you show that if will always pass, right?
[12:18:44] <Alturic> Ok, so I'm doing: http://pastebin.com/raw/VqWZb7dx Now, the response right now is simply a string, so even if this was working correctly the condition should not match.
[12:19:04] <robertmaxrees> if ($(response[0] == "updated")) { will always be true because you're passing it to jquery.
[12:19:31] <robertmaxrees> $({}[0] == "updated") creates a jquery object - that's a truthy value.
[12:19:36] <robertmaxrees> drop the $() form that.
[12:19:38] <robertmaxrees> *from that
[12:21:27] <Alturic> I see.
[12:21:37] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[12:22:05] <Alturic> So $({}[0] == "updated") creates an object with "updated" ?
[12:22:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:22:35] <robertmaxrees> $() generally works as a constructor - it usually returns a jquery object.
[12:22:49] <Alturic> I guess that's my only question (thank for the help, it's failing the condition now), you said it creates an object, but the object doesn't == "updated", so why exactly does it pass?
[12:23:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:23:12] <taplar_lunch> why are you trying to create a jQuery object?
[12:23:13] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things :)
[12:23:17] <robertmaxrees> $() creates a jquery objuect.
[12:23:28] <robertmaxrees> most objects are truthy.
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> hence why it passes.
[12:23:31] <Alturic> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[12:23:43] <robertmaxrees> putting a conditional inside the jquery call doesn't really chjange that ;)
[12:23:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/co8p5n7q/
[12:24:00] <robertmaxrees> you get an empty object out of that.
[12:24:28] <Alturic> Yea, I see now.
[12:24:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:24:39] <robertmaxrees> why were you passing it to $() in the first place?
[12:24:48] <taplar_lunch> ^
[12:25:07] <robertmaxrees> also: instead of checking the 0th index, you can just do if (response.length) {} since you apparently have an array.
[12:42:37] <taplar_lunch> ah, it continues
[12:43:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:43:11] <taplar> questions followed by dead silence
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:43:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[12:43:45] <robertmaxrees> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_XHj2ROdY here have something funky in the meantime.
[12:44:38] <taplar> that's a lot of violin
[12:45:23] <robertmaxrees> and horns.
[12:45:30] <taplar> lol
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> the 70's called they want their stank back.
[12:46:08] <taplar> mmm, reverb
[12:46:37] <KnightsOfNi> Hey, I have this textarea, which allows editing of a parapgraph text. When user clicks ok, the paragraph text should contain the new value entered in the textarea... Problem is that $element.html(newText) will allow html tags... Which is kinda needed because the newline have to be converted to BR tags
[12:46:50] <KnightsOfNi> how would you strip out all the rest and make this secure?
[12:47:51] <taplar> are you saying text() destroys the \n's?
[12:48:12] <KnightsOfNi> well yeah... it all shows on one line
[12:48:18] <taplar> huh
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> imo you're using html wrong if you have linebreaks within <p> tags.
[12:48:34] <robertmaxrees> also: why not strip in your backend instead?
[12:48:42] <KnightsOfNi> it's actually a div robertmaxrees, dunno why I said p
[12:49:01] <robertmaxrees> same diff :)
[12:49:04] <KnightsOfNi> robertmaxrees, I do strip that in the backend, but I don't want ot wait for a response from the server to display the new value
[12:49:24] <KnightsOfNi> If I can just display it instantly, it feels smoother for the user
[12:49:41] <robertmaxrees> heh, sure.  then just replicate what your backend is doing.
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise things will get weird quick.
[12:49:59] <KnightsOfNi> In the backend I can just use the strip tags function
[12:50:02] <KnightsOfNi> no such thing in js
[12:50:17] <robertmaxrees> which backend are you using
[12:50:18] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:50:23] <KnightsOfNi> PHP
[12:51:01] <taplar> what about something like... text(  newValue.split( '\n' ).join('<br>') )
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> looks like that strips the tags wholesale.  so wht's different between this and .text()?
[12:53:33] <KnightsOfNi> is there no other way to make line breaks without using <br> ?
[12:54:00] <taplar> <p> does a line break afterwards
[12:54:13] <taplar> you can css display: block also as an option to elements
[12:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be using <br> much these days tbqh.  use more declarative markup.
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have paragraphs of text - that's what <p> is for.
[12:54:47] <KnightsOfNi> how else would i display data from a text field in the database that contains \n symbols?
[12:55:15] <taplar> depends on if you want it to render or not
[12:55:27] <taplar> cause if you want it to render, \n's are for the most part ignored
[12:55:34] <KnightsOfNi> It has to render... it's vital to the situation
[12:55:56] <KnightsOfNi> when someone  enters 2 empty lines, it should be saved as such
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> linebreaks are pretty much ignored in html.
[12:56:41] <robertmaxrees> so relying on them in your data is a shaky proposition.
[12:57:04] <taplar> <pre> is an option if it's just text
[12:57:05] <KnightsOfNi> so how would you do it then? How do you save this information?
[12:57:21] <taplar> probably can put the pre effect on a css style too
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what the system itself is.
[12:57:46] <KnightsOfNi> imagine you are making something like wordpress where people can make blog posts in their gui editor
[12:57:54] <robertmaxrees> if you're building a CMS or something similar, i'd use json to break things down.
[12:58:01] <KnightsOfNi> obviously they need to be able to make empty lines between sections
[12:58:08] <taplar> then i'd use either tinymce or summernote and not worry about it
[12:58:25] <taplar> if you're not using either, i'd probably say try summernote first
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> you're right for not storing HTML, but I'd opt for storing things as JSON or something similar.
[12:59:03] <chipyy> Hey
[12:59:32] <KnightsOfNi> json... for a piece of text? I don't understand how that would work
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> it's not a piece of text though :)  it's a blog post.
[13:00:09] <robertmaxrees> you probably have a title, post date, tags, etc.
[13:00:10] <taplar> chipyy: sup
[13:00:19] <chipyy> i need advice. I have table with data from database. Each table row has id and two butttons. I have edit button and on click on this button appears modal. Now if somebody could give me advice how to get data in this modal
[13:00:30] <chipyy> so i can edit each row
[13:00:46] <taplar> chipyy: can you show us what you have so far?
[13:01:14] <chipyy> should i in modal call php again and from ID which each row call datas? or how should i do it
[13:01:41] <taplar> the button belongs to the row?  if so in the event handler you can do $(this).closest('tr').data('id') or whatever
[13:02:13] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfNi you'd use something like https://bpaste.net/show/7674668b70cb
[13:02:34] <robertmaxrees> then you could transform the post_body as needed.
[13:02:39] <KnightsOfNi> robertmaxrees, ok, but how about 2 empty lines?
[13:02:47] <chipyy> $(this).data(id) that way i get id from row, but now i dont know how should i make next step
[13:02:59] <chipyy> on button click ofcourse
[13:03:10] <taplar> data(id) would be data-id="", attr('id') would be id="" just fwi
[13:03:22] <taplar> *fyi
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfNi using that example, you'd have two entries in the post_body
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/ecfdaeb46016
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> something like this,
[13:03:36] <chipyy> taplar each row has two buttons with row id ( edit and delete)
[13:03:44] <KnightsOfNi> robertmaxrees, ok gotcha
[13:03:52] <taplar> 'row id' ?
[13:04:43] <chipyy> i meant <tr data-id="row ['idsomething']"
[13:04:59] <taplar> ok, and the buttons?
[13:05:25] <taplar> again, if you could show us what your doing currently would help us avoid some of these questions, :)
[13:05:28] <chipyy> buttons also have data-id="...."
[13:05:53] <taplar> if the data is on the parent row you could do without it on the buttons, but ok
[13:06:23] <chipyy> in <tr> i just put in case that i would need it
[13:07:13] <taplar> the idea is to kinda stick all your data on your <tr>, have two classes on your buttons 'edit' and 'delete' or something like that, that you use to bind your event handlers on
[13:07:13] <taplar> then they can reference the parent row to get the data-* they need
[13:07:52] <taplar> it makes sense to put them on the tr as the tr is in a sense the encapsulation of the element, no?
[13:08:43] <chipyy> taplar: http://prnt.sc/cvgypf
[13:09:02] <taplar> heh, i can't debug a screenshot man, :)
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> chipyy make a fiddle yo.
[13:09:30] <chipyy> taplar: on click of the button i open modal and in that window i would like to edit
[13:10:12] <chipyy> i was thinking that i should show inputs which would have values already written so u can modify them
[13:10:31] <chipyy> robertmaxrees its connected to database :)
[13:10:38] <taplar> you can mock out data
[13:11:04] <taplar> just a row or two showing the structure of your table, and the logic your using is enough
[13:11:33] <chipyy> taplar could you give me some instruction how would you do it
[13:11:43] <chipyy> on button click i open modal, then what ?:)
[13:11:47] <taplar> i thought i just did above
[13:12:11] <chipyy> but i would like more precise :D
[13:12:20] <taplar> data-* on the tr for all the things you need, grab the ones you need when you open the modal and do what you need with htem
[13:12:32] <chipyy> would you on click add inputs or you would already write inputs in modal?
[13:12:42] <taplar> on click
[13:12:52] <taplar> cause rows have different data, right?
[13:13:01] <taplar> you have to change the display for what they are editing
[13:13:17] <chipyy> edit window would have the same data as rows
[13:13:37] <taplar> each row has different data, right?
[13:13:43] <chipyy> aha, yes yes
[13:13:56] <chipyy> and also differend id
[13:14:19] <taplar> so you edit row 1, modal popups up with row 1 data.  same for row 2, 3, n..
[13:14:37] <chipyy> yes something like that
[13:14:46] <taplar> right... so what is confusing about that?
[13:15:31] <chipyy> what would i like to know how would you get data in modal. would you use jquery or would you call php and mysql to check for data where this ID is inside?
[13:15:48] <taplar> i'd use jquery to get the info out of the data-* elements on the row
[13:16:40] <chipyy> ok, but how i would insert this data using jquery into modal?
[13:16:54] <chipyy> is there any guide :)
[13:17:17] <taplar> how do you set values on inputs?
[13:18:06] <taplar> are you familiar?
[13:18:14] <chipyy> i am familiar with that yes
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> that's how.
[13:18:30] <chipyy> but modals and jquery hates each other dont they? :D
[13:18:39] <taplar> why?
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:18:42] <taplar> it's all DOM
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> where'd you hear that they hate each other?
[13:19:25] <taplar> heh, i love when programmers apply human emotions to code
[13:20:10] <chipyy> because i have problem with this modals :D
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:20:20] <l2256> Hi.  I'm trying to change an HTML5 data-attribute subelement using jquery.  Here's my non-working pen, lhttp://codepen.io/lists/pen/kkRQGq?editors=1111 .  I get no error, but no change in the target element (here, 'height').  What am I doing wrong?
[13:20:22] <taplar> fiiiiiiiidle
[13:20:50] <chipyy> dont know because i dont know how to add jquery inside modal that will work
[13:21:06] <robertmaxrees> l2256 .attr() and .data() don't edit the same thing.
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> use .data() to set AND get.
[13:22:28] <taplar> chipyy: what do you mean add it inside the modal?
[13:22:58] <taplar> your script is wherever you're placing it that is opening the modal
[13:23:07] <taplar> unless your doing modals with like bootstrap
[13:23:16] <chipyy> yes, i think that my brains woke up, i just got some ideas :D
[13:23:28] <chipyy> modals with bootstrap are yes
[13:23:42] <taplar> ok, then bootstrap modals throw events when they open/close/etc
[13:23:48] <taplar> you can bind to those to do extra stuff
[13:25:01] <taplar> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-events
[13:26:54] <taplar> capishe?
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaand silence.
[13:27:47] <taplar> all day errr day
[13:28:14] <chipyy> i was playing with some code. i capishe what you mean with that link yes. i think its better to use what bootstrap is offering ::)
[13:30:53] <chipyy> tnx bye bye
[13:31:01] <taplar> tc
[13:36:39] <l2256> robertmaxrees: 'uncle'!  I'm apparently not clever enuf to get it done :-(  Could you kindly mod that pen with a working example?
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:37:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> that's not how we do it :)
[13:37:11] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle :)
[13:37:16] <robertmaxrees> show mne what you tried.
[13:37:48] <robertmaxrees> alsO: .data() doesn't take funmctions as args.
[13:38:21] <l2256> robertmaxrees: What's the difference between my codepen and a jsfiddle?
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> woops sorry - did you update the pen?
[13:38:50] <MikeD_> what did you mean .data() doesn't take functions as args?
[13:39:03] <robertmaxrees> .data() cannot take a function as an argument.
[13:39:21] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with .attr(), but you can't with .data()
[13:40:43] <l2256> So this, http://stackoverflow.com/a/38304571, where I cribbed it from, is wrong?
[13:41:08] <MikeD_> but you can assign objects via .data('foo', myobject) and that works, so why if a function is an object would you not be able to pass functions to .data() ?
[13:41:14] <robertmaxrees> you can't mix and match attr and data
[13:41:24] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ it doesn't run the function.
[13:41:39] <robertmaxrees> you could associate a function to an object, but you can't use it to set the value.
[13:41:53] <MikeD_> kk, that's the clarification i was looking for :)
[13:42:12] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't ever associate a function to an object like that fwiw.
[13:42:12] <taplar> excluding IIFEs
[13:42:22] <robertmaxrees> that's different though :)
[13:42:43] <robertmaxrees> l2256 so what're you trying to accomplish here?
[13:45:57] <taplar> lol
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:49:04] <taplar> how's the house coming along?
[13:49:51] <robertmaxrees> okayish.  they started demo on it.  they're starting asbestos abatement today.
[13:51:16] <taplar> demo(lition)?
[13:51:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> lots of floors torn up right now.
[13:51:51] <taplar> k, heh. for a sec i thought you might be saying the whole shebang
[13:52:10] <paulvd> We cannot pass a .show() funtion based on attributes? https://jsfiddle.net/7b6zuabu/1/
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> heh, i mean, they're basically doing that taplar
[13:52:48] <paulvd> er actually https://jsfiddle.net/7b6zuabu/2/
[13:52:53] <taplar> attr() returns a string
[13:53:05] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[13:53:16] <robertmaxrees> $(".related a").attr(clicked)
[13:53:21] <taplar> you can't string.show()
[13:53:33] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find the .related a with the same data-solution value?
[13:53:38] <paulvd> yes
[13:53:47] <paulvd> and trigger a click on it
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> .attr() just gets or sets that value.
[13:53:54] <paulvd> the .show() is just for the test
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .filter()
[13:53:58] <paulvd> dur
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7b6zuabu/3/
[13:54:57] <paulvd> cool so .filter
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> data attributes aren't great to select onso use $.fn.filter for 'em instead
[13:58:13] <paulvd> thanks
[14:07:55] <l2256> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to change WRITE a new value to a subelement in one of the html5 data-attributes .  Specifically, change the value of "height".
[14:08:06] <robertmaxrees> surer.
[14:08:08] <robertmaxrees> *sure
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> you use .data() to do that.
[14:10:18] <l2256> right, and I thought I was doing that with "$(this).data('size')"
[14:10:32] <robertmaxrees> that just gets a value.
[14:10:38] <l2256> AGain, is that stackoverflow example wrong?
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> .data('size',
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> it's certainly strange.
[14:10:56] <robertmaxrees> it's mixing .attr() and .data() use.
[14:11:03] <robertmaxrees> and i doubt that is works correctly
[14:11:20] <l2256> You'd hope that since it was actually UPvoted, that it'd work ... that's kindof their point ...
[14:11:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.  i see .attr() and .data() use being mixed.
[14:11:57] <robertmaxrees> that's usually a sign that it'll be buggy.
[14:12:01] <z1haze_work> can anyone explain why someone might do this? http://dpaste.com/3TH18QQ (line 6 and line 7) instead of just using location.href ?
[14:12:24] <l2256> So, anyway.  I don't get this, and can't seem to figure it out from your piecemeal comments, and refusal to actually help with a real example.  So , I guess whatever ... thanks anyway.
[14:13:11] <robertmaxrees> z1haze huh?>
[14:13:14] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[14:13:35] <z1haze_work> it looks like they create an anchor on the page just the get the href of the page
[14:13:43] <z1haze_work> it just doesnt make sense to me i was wondreing why they did that
[14:13:59] <taplar> maybe something to do with a relative url maybe?  *shrug*
[14:14:09] <shoky> it's a way to use the browser to parse a url
[14:14:19] <z1haze_work> does location.href already do that?
[14:14:31] <shoky> location.href loads another page..
[14:14:42] <robertmaxrees> also: this takes a url as an argument.
[14:14:55] <lukas_> Hello Guys
[14:15:07] <z1haze_work> location.href loads a page, what?
[14:15:19] <shoky> changing location.href will load the new url
[14:15:29] <shoky> or.. no idea what you meant
[14:15:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:41] <z1haze_work> i didnt say change it
[14:15:42] <taplar> lukas_: bon'jour
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> shoky he's confused about why you wouldn't just use location.href to get the current url.
[14:15:58] <z1haze_work> sorry, i thought i was pretty clear on that
[14:16:00] <taplar> z1haze: your assuming the url provided is the same as the location.href
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze this is parsing a url that's been passed in, not for the page.
[14:16:15] <shoky> ah
[14:16:28] <z1haze_work> oh and creating the anchor does something helpful ?
[14:16:34] <taplar> lol
[14:16:36] <shoky> it parses the url
[14:16:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work correct.  you pass in a url and then allow the browser to do its normal parsing.
[14:16:53] <shoky> gives you e.g. a .search property on the anchor
[14:17:00] <shoky> that only contains the query string part
[14:17:10] <z1haze_work> ahh
[14:17:16] <z1haze_work> cool thank you
[14:17:18] <lukas_> Is WebStorm a good IDE for web development
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> accoding to some people.
[14:17:35] <robertmaxrees> also: "web development" is a really broad term lukas_ :)
[14:18:02] <lukas_> front end web development ... :D
[14:18:15] <z1haze_work> @shoky, could it not have just done url.search() ?
[14:18:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean just html, css, and js?
[14:18:25] <z1haze_work> on the url that was passed into the function
[14:18:25] <shoky> z1haze_work: try and see?
[14:18:31] <taplar> 'string'.search() ?
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze the issue is that the url passed into the function would just be a string - it wouldn't have that method on it.
[14:19:18] <lukas_> yes, client side development
[14:19:21] <shoky> also it's not a method ;p
[14:19:36] <z1haze_work> im trying to find methods that are available on an anchor then..
[14:19:46] <z1haze_work> i thought it was just a string
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> lukas_ i just use VS Code and my browser.
[14:19:59] <robertmaxrees> Sublime and atom are good choices, too.
[14:19:59] <shoky> lukas_: it's pretty good, but pretty heavy. for me personally it's not worth it
[14:21:10] <z1haze_work> i did try.. i can called search on any string
[14:21:29] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search
[14:21:33] <robertmaxrees> different kind of search z1haze
[14:22:11] <z1haze_work> so what exactly is the search property on an anchor?
[14:22:22] <shoky> z1haze_work: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> z1haze the querystring iirc.
[14:22:39] <taplar> "shoky: gives you e.g. a .search property on the anchor
[14:22:39] <taplar> that only contains the query string part "
[14:22:44] <shoky> or even  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/search
[14:23:02] <z1haze_work> i think i get it
[14:23:14] <z1haze_work> checks if there is a query param
[14:23:33] <z1haze_work> thats cool
[14:23:33] <shoky> .search is just a string
[14:23:37] <shoky> it doesn't check anything
[14:23:44] <z1haze_work> well i mean it just returns the search portion
[14:24:01] <shoky> that wasn't clear at all ;p
[14:24:06] <z1haze_work> yea my bad
[14:24:25] <z1haze_work> i get it though - i never knew that property existed
[14:26:05] <jquery387> how to give string more attributes?
[14:26:07] <jquery387> var answear1 = 'banana';
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:26:30] <jquery387> var answear1 = 'apple';
[14:26:46] <z1haze_work> O.o
[14:26:46] <jquery387> var answear1 = 'orange';
[14:26:47] <shoky> ... yes
[14:26:48] <z1haze_work> see im not that bad
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery387 not helpful at all.
[14:27:17] <robertmaxrees> need to be clearer.
[14:27:17] <z1haze_work> jquery387: make an object
[14:27:23] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[14:27:25] <jquery387> var answear1 could be 'banana' or 'apple' or 'orange'
[14:27:40] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[14:27:42] <z1haze_work> array?
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery387 you mean you want to be able to match against any of those?
[14:27:55] <hellyeah> jquery387:  do array
[14:28:01] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if so, yeah do an array.
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> and then use .indexOf()
[14:28:06] <taplar> i look away for a sec and this happens...
[14:28:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are The GAME
[14:28:48] <shoky> dat jqueary
[14:28:50] <taplar> huh?
[14:28:54] <hellyeah> do you know megadeth?
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> lol this channel
[14:28:58] <hellyeah> ops
[14:29:00] <hellyeah> motorhead
[14:29:01] <taplar> no clue
[14:29:32] <jquery387> var answear= [banana, apple, orange];
[14:29:40] <taplar> 'banana'
[14:29:45] <z1haze_work> 'apple'
[14:29:46] <jquery387> someting like that?
[14:29:47] <robertmaxrees> needs quotes around each one.
[14:29:47] <jquery387> ok
[14:29:51] <jquery387> ok =)
[14:29:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JF8oSxXtM if you have time
[14:30:03] <jquery387> thx
[14:30:05] <hellyeah> use ""
[14:30:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:30:23] <robertmaxrees> little late there hellyeah ;)
[14:30:28] <hellyeah> :d
[14:30:46] <hellyeah> i wrote before reading that was a mistake i made :D
[14:31:15] <hellyeah> oh well at least i can answer some questions. Thats cool
[14:32:29] <taplar> i like the instrumental, not sure i dig the singer
[14:32:50] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, lemmy's voice was getting pretty rough in the end,.
[14:34:33] <hellyeah> probably it is because of drugs he used
[14:34:40] <hellyeah> i heard he used drugs
[14:34:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:57] <robertmaxrees> he also smoked a lot and sang like that for years.
[14:34:59] <hellyeah> anyway it is off topic
[14:35:12] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> this kid.
[14:35:15] <hellyeah> drugs included joint i suppose
[14:35:16] <hellyeah> :D
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> and also cigarettes.
[14:35:54] <hellyeah> well he smoked a lot. robertmaxrees i am kinda more mature nowadays
[14:35:56] <hellyeah> :D
[14:36:04] <taplar> hell, sugar is a drug
[14:36:07] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you lost me.
[14:36:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:37:00] <hellyeah> i men i am mature like grown up kid
[14:37:10] <hellyeah> i am not doing baby steps anymore :D
[14:37:15] <hellyeah> i hope you understand
[14:37:25] <taplar> lol, how did the drug discussion tie into this?
[14:37:30] <robertmaxrees> errr, my remark was more of making light that you were trying to tell me that something was offtopic.
[14:37:31] <robertmaxrees> it was funny.
[14:37:56] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't making an assessment of your maturity level.  "this kid" is an idiom.
[14:37:58] <arc_> i have to ask, how is sugar a drug
[14:38:26] <taplar> drug - a chemical that changes you
[14:38:38] <robertmaxrees> then all food is a drug ;)
[14:38:39] <taplar> in the broad sense
[14:38:40] <arc_> so literally anything that you ingest
[14:38:44] <taplar> :D
[14:38:47] <robertmaxrees> or come into contact with.
[14:39:02] <arc_> ya i don't buy that definition :p
[14:39:12] <hellyeah> "this kid" is an idiom i didnt know that
[14:39:34] <robertmaxrees> "drug" is something often taken solely for a particular benefit, psychoactive or physical, but not necerssarily as food.
[14:39:40] <hellyeah> mushroom is cool
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[14:41:37] <robertmaxrees> cripes firefox's cache has gotten super sticky.
[14:45:53] <taplar> ?
[14:46:31] <robertmaxrees> hard refreshes just stop working sometimes.
[14:46:40] <robertmaxrees> have to go clear it manually via setttings.
[14:47:25] <taplar> you could always go to the cog and click that "Disable HTTP Cache (when toolbox is open)".  I usually run like that
[14:47:42] <robertmaxrees> oh shit that's what i've been missing.
[14:47:54] <robertmaxrees> i got a new machine recently and keep spacing on all of that stuff.
[14:47:56] <robertmaxrees> thank you.
[14:47:58] <taplar> :)
[14:48:25] * hellyeah taplar knows the best
[14:48:32] <taplar> lies!
[14:48:57] <taplar> as per the sugar discussion
[14:49:32] <taplar> sugar!  *dun dun de da dun dun* ohhhhh, honey honey!
[14:50:21] <hellyeah> there is sugar form of drug if i am not mistaken
[14:50:29] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:50:37] <taplar> glucose?
[14:50:48] <robertmaxrees> that's just a component of sugar.
[14:50:59] <taplar> i thought that was the broken down form of all sugars
[14:51:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:51:30] <robertmaxrees> glucose is one of the three base forms of sugar.
[14:51:52] <taplar> glucose, sutrose(?), and ...
[14:51:53] <robertmaxrees> glucose, fructose, and galactose.
[14:51:59] <taplar> fructose!
[14:52:06] <robertmaxrees> sucrose is tanbler sugar.
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> breaks down into glucose and fructose.
[14:52:22] <hellyeah> glucose fructoze and lactoze
[14:52:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:52:30] <taplar> lol
[14:52:33] * taplar walks away
[14:52:34] <robertmaxrees> lactose is like sucrose ;)
[14:52:40] <robertmaxrees> i just listed the three lol
[14:52:44] <hellyeah> sorry for my english btw
[14:52:46] <robertmaxrees> glucose, fructose, and galactose.
[14:52:57] <hellyeah> ah yea ic
[14:53:16] <taplar> and whatever the f they put in those sugar free candies that sux
[14:53:50] <taplar> dude, no lie.  you want to put yourself into some pain.  eat some of those sugar free reeces peanut butter cups
[14:54:26] <taplar> reminds me of some of those sugar free items that have hilarious amazon reviews
[14:55:03] * hellyeah wow i didnt see taplar is conversating like that before :D
[14:55:11] <taplar> hmm?
[14:55:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:55:45] <hellyeah> that was a joke :D
[14:55:47] <robertmaxrees> i feel like sometimes hellyeah just wants to talk
[14:55:59] <hellyeah> no doubt there
[14:56:25] <hellyeah> actually hoing someone ask question that i can answer
[14:56:26] <hellyeah> :D
[14:56:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:56:46] <robertmaxrees> just gotta be patient, yo.
[14:56:50] <taplar> http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-01-16/the-amazon-reviews-for-haribo-sugarless-gummy-bears-are-disgustingly-hilarious/
[14:56:51] <taplar> enjoy
[14:57:00] <hellyeah> hahaha
[14:57:56] <hellyeah> question from me. namespacing or parametric modules. What is personal preferences?
[14:58:15] <taplar> parametric?
[14:58:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean like var x = require('module')(someoptions); ?
[14:59:27] <taplar> i haven't done any require or node or anything like that so I've only done namespacing
[14:59:55] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html
[14:59:56] <robertmaxrees> can also use it in requirejs.
[15:00:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that page doesn't mention the phrase "parametric modules"
[15:01:15] <robertmaxrees> imho use the ES6 module system and call it a day,.
[15:02:43] <taplar> this is my current go to namespace structure: https://jsfiddle.net/f8dc43v9/
[15:08:21] <lukas_> what do you think about my footer? http://i.imgur.com/0Is2M44.png
[15:08:43] <taplar> lot of black.  you should see a doctor
[15:08:57] <taplar> circulation problems
[15:09:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:09:03] <taplar> what about it?
[15:09:11] <robertmaxrees> be careful with that font and font size, as well as the contrast.
[15:15:21] <taplar> hellyeah: you went all quiet on us man
[15:16:35] <hellyeah> i am watching Mortal Kombat x fatalities :d
[15:18:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am still under mobbing, try to find a new job
[15:18:17] <taplar> ah
[15:22:18] <ZoderUck> java conditional operator is that the same as a so called IFFIE ?
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:23:19] <taplar> lol
[15:23:27] <robertmaxrees> the ternary and iife's are two totally different things.
[15:23:34] <robertmaxrees> also: java and javascript are totally different, as wel.
[15:23:39] <hellyeah> i am not the only one who doesnt understand the question
[15:23:43] <taplar> are you talking about that <!-- [IF IE] --> stuff?
[15:23:44] <ZoderUck> how do i view a div conditionally like ngIf ?
[15:23:57] <robertmaxrees> "view a div conditionally"
[15:24:02] <ZoderUck> no uh
[15:24:03] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to be more specific.
[15:24:09] <ZoderUck> yeah, conditionally yeah
[15:24:15] <robertmaxrees> try again :)
[15:24:19] <taplar> if (something) $(div).show(); ?
[15:24:25] <ZoderUck> hmn, yes
[15:24:31] <ZoderUck> yes yes,
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> that's how you do it then.
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:24:40] <ZoderUck> if crossdomain then div visible
[15:24:41] <robertmaxrees> an if statement.
[15:24:46] <robertmaxrees> wait back up.
[15:24:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> "if crossdomain"?
[15:25:04] <ZoderUck> i need to hideh the adds of a camstream
[15:25:04] <robertmaxrees> back waaaay up and describe your situation a bit.
[15:25:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> get out duder.
[15:25:26] <robertmaxrees> we're not going to help you with this.
[15:25:35] <ZoderUck> luckly you are not a channel operator
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm not?
[15:25:46] <taplar> unlucky you, lol
[15:25:49] <ZoderUck> we = not everybody
[15:25:53] <hellyeah> hhahahaha
[15:25:56] <ZoderUck> some do want to help me
[15:26:01] <hellyeah> :F
[15:26:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to ask again.
[15:26:03] <hellyeah> :W
[15:26:05] <hellyeah> :X
[15:26:14] <ZoderUck> Wax your own
[15:26:21] <hellyeah> i dont understand what he asked
[15:26:41] <taplar> it's a continuation of a discussion from a few days ago.  don't worry about it
[15:27:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, let's just not continue.
[15:27:36] <hellyeah> sure no problem for me hmm
[15:28:14] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[15:29:19] <hellyeah> this question sounds weird but i gotta ask. Is there some sources that publish question you can solve with jquery?
[15:29:33] <taplar> huh?
[15:29:33] <robertmaxrees> codecademy might have something
[15:29:43] <robertmaxrees> he's looking for tutorials that have to solve problems.
[15:29:48] <taplar> ah
[15:30:07] <taplar> try.jquery.com has that, no?
[15:30:27] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah
[15:30:30] <robertmaxrees> there's that, too.
[15:32:33] <taplar> one thing you could do too is when you find a tutorial like that, when you solve a problem, then try to figure out how to do it with vanilla javascript
[15:32:54] <hellyeah> actually i am searching some problems to solve because in work place they avoid me to work. I dont want to get rusty.
[15:33:19] <hellyeah> taplar:  good idea thanks for that
[15:33:19] <taplar> o.O you don't have any work?
[15:33:24] <hellyeah> no
[15:33:36] <taplar> so they're paying you to just sit there?
[15:33:41] <hellyeah> i finished works and they ignored my affort
[15:33:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[15:33:51] <taplar> damn
[15:34:13] <hellyeah> like 7 months passed
[15:34:15] <taplar> i needa move to turkey
[15:34:31] <hellyeah> they are embecile
[15:34:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  i want to work my ass off
[15:36:02] <hellyeah> well i can do codeacademy's jquery courses
[15:36:10] <taplar> but yeah, learning to do the solutions in vanilla is also a good thing.  helps unshackle you from the mindset that you have to do it with jquery
[15:39:06] <hellyeah> good
[15:39:07] <taplar> YESSSSS!!!!!
[15:39:20] <hellyeah> YES to what?
[15:39:30] <taplar> my functional tests passed.  so happy right now
[15:39:58] <hellyeah> well i want to write codes
[15:40:01] <hellyeah> damn
[15:40:15] <taplar> been doing a performance rewrite of one part of our app and I was so worried that I was going to miss something in the whole of it
[15:40:44] <hellyeah> happy for you :)
[15:41:00] <taplar> definitely a load off the mind, :)
[15:41:09] <robertmaxrees> very nice.
[15:41:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  you teach me a lot and you gave your time to i appreciated
[15:42:07] <taplar> dude, np.  it helps me too
[15:42:18] <taplar> i only remember most this stuff because i'm re-explaining it to othersw
[15:42:54] <hellyeah> so mutual life forms then
[15:43:23] <taplar> hey now, everyone's just dudes and chicks, ;)
[15:43:32] <hellyeah> what i mean is i am glad to hear that :=
[15:43:35] <hellyeah> :)
[15:43:50] <hellyeah> taplar:  you always said i am dude from keyboard. Thats nice
[15:44:04] <taplar> *shrug* the way i see life.
[15:44:34] <taplar> everyone's the same.  just trying to figure out wtf they're supossed to be doing
[15:44:50] <AwkwardCough> dude... what if we are all like... metaphysical keyboards typing our way through life.... like whoa
[15:45:22] <taplar> that would give a more disturbing meaning to ctrl+alt+del
[15:45:25] <hellyeah> some part of use is supposed to be metaphysical
[15:45:45] <hellyeah> us*
[15:46:46] <hellyeah> good night
[15:47:53] <taplar> l8r
[15:48:22] <taplar> AwkwardCough: i should be a politician.  I think "we're all just dudes and chicks" could get me a ton of votes right now
[15:49:58] <taplar> are you a dude?  are you a chick?  or a dude chick?  it's all good.  join me, we'll fight for dude chick chickdude equality!
[15:50:02] <AwkwardCough> isnt that *insert political sounding name here*'s strategy hahaha bazinga
[15:50:23] <taplar> yeah really
[15:51:49] <taplar> lol, did you do a bazinga?
[15:53:05] <AwkwardCough> I felt it captured the moment
[15:56:38] * taplar queues some eminem
[16:44:10] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun.
[16:47:24] <taplar> been one of those days
[16:47:49] <robertmaxrees> hella
[17:27:27] <novice> Hi.  I'm having an issue with my ui tabs initializing when I click on new modal buttons.  It initializes on the first but then won't on any others.  http://kopy.io/mzlZQ
[17:27:56] <taplar> ids are unique
[17:28:00] <taplar> use a class instead
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:29:40] <novice> That did it.  Thanks.  I was following https://jqueryui.com/tabs/ but it only had one set of tabs and not one for each state like I'm doing.
[17:29:52] <taplar> also you should really only initialize once, so a global selector for all of them is kinda not desirable
[17:31:10] <novice> When i try to initialize it once, it breaks.
[17:31:25] <taplar> just gotta scope down bra
[17:31:59] <novice> I don't think I'm going to be able to do that since I'm using Highmaps with their modal popups.
[17:32:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/gjtq1yn4/
[17:33:25] <taplar> though children() might be more performant than the find()
[17:34:10] <novice> okay.  thanks
[18:13:36] <al_nz1> morning people
[18:13:50] <taplar> sup
[18:13:55] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:14:55] <al_nz1> ahhh, the two pillars of #jquery
[18:14:58] <al_nz1> :)
[18:27:43] <al_nz1> soooo, I have got a very basic example of adding a input box, but if I end up adding each and every <div and <input element, it will be very slow - https://jsfiddle.net/b68ccamc/7/
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> are youa ctually seeing erformance problems?
[18:28:38] <al_nz1> its only a fiddle :)
[18:28:45] <al_nz1> Im just messing about at the moment
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> " if I end
[18:28:58] <robertmaxrees> up adding each and every <div and <input element, it will be very slow
[18:29:34] <robertmaxrees> so this is a smell - unless you're actully having performance problems, don't worry about it.
[18:30:28] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I have not explained myself very well....let me try again
[18:31:26] <robertmaxrees> also: you really should use the external resources panel and not do inline event handlers, but that's neither here nor there :)
[18:32:07] <al_nz1> How will I add the very first picker, which is "Code" - there is div then another div then a label then a select then a bunch of options, then the tags get closed. Do you need one line of JS to add each of those?
[18:32:29] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah tried that - but couldnt get it to render properly, sorry
[18:32:50] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/EVLo2pX.png
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> these warnings make it hard to work in the html pane, which is why i mentioned that.
[18:33:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're asking how you'd add each of these via JS?
[18:36:36] <al_nz1> yeah, Im wondering if there is a quick way to add more than one element at once?
[18:37:02] <al_nz1> Some of my select pickers have 100 options in them, which could make the code to add them very very long
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> well, first question - why are you generating this client-side?
[18:38:23] <al_nz1> generating what? the add row functionality?
[18:38:54] <robertmaxrees> you said you have 100 options in a select picker.
[18:39:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, basicallyu.
[18:39:19] <robertmaxrees> *basically - are all the rows going to be the same?
[18:39:40] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'd store that data in an endpoint
[18:39:47] <arc_> i'm sorry to do this but if you have 100+ options i highly recommend figuring out a different way of allowing users to select them because that many options in a select is terrible
[18:39:52] <arc_> even on desktop but especially on mobile
[18:39:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah that, too.
[18:40:10] <arc_> it's basically unusable on mobile
[18:40:26] <robertmaxrees> like, an autocomplete widget with search would be better in that case.
[18:40:36] <robertmaxrees> but you really wannt some kind of basic model or something.
[18:42:18] <robertmaxrees> and you want a templating engine for the rest of this.
[18:43:01] <arc_> i was trying to use the mobile version of a database tool for work, which used a select that had like 150 options, and it froze my phone. which is a nexus 5x
[18:45:23] <al_nz1> arc_: it has a filter, so type first two letters and u only have a few options
[18:45:41] <robertmaxrees> powering that via ajax might still be a good idea.
[18:46:19] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: a templating engine?
[18:46:23] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:46:30] <al_nz1> like?
[18:46:32] <arc_> okay, you're good then
[18:46:50] <robertmaxrees> pick your poison.  there are lots of choices.  underscore has one.  moustache.  handlebars.  dust....
[18:46:53] <al_nz1> arc_: bootstrap :)
[18:47:12] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: tell me the best poison :)
[18:47:30] <robertmaxrees> i can't.
[18:47:30] <al_nz1> best = well documented + supported in my case
[18:47:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm not writing your project.
[18:47:44] <robertmaxrees> they all have different strengths and weaknesses.
[18:53:57] <al_nz1> I think taplar had a fiddle he sent me last week using a temaplte
[18:54:02] <al_nz1> but not a engine
[18:54:15] <taplar> yeah, just a small replace example
[18:54:39] <robertmaxrees> that would be a templating engine.
[18:54:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:54:45] <robertmaxrees> just a basic one.
[18:55:29] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: so the engine does a similar thing but on a bigger scale?
[18:55:49] <robertmaxrees> againa
[18:55:52] <robertmaxrees> *again
[18:55:56] <robertmaxrees> what he gave you was an engine.
[18:55:57] <taplar> larger engines have more dynamic logic build in
[18:56:17] <robertmaxrees> but there are lots out there that get bigger and more comprehensive in their feature sets.
[18:56:32] <roflmyeggo> is it bad practice to use tap events in place of click events when mobile support is required?
[18:56:53] <roflmyeggo> running into some issues with IE not firing tap events whenever click events are fired
[18:56:59] <taplar> can't click on a mobile platform, eh?
[18:57:20] <roflmyeggo> taplar: just certain versions of IE
[18:57:35] <roflmyeggo> no tap event is fired when click is pressed
[18:57:41] <taplar> right
[18:57:54] <roflmyeggo> why must IE be so difficult
[18:57:59] <robertmaxrees> actually...
[18:58:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:00] <roflmyeggo> "pointers"? lol
[18:58:02] <al_nz1> ok.I will bok mark the link this time. Do you have again taplar? I think I ended up rebooting my PC
[18:58:03] <taplar> lol, why would a click trigger a tap?
[18:58:24] <roflmyeggo> taplar: so that you can just listen for tap instead of both
[18:58:28] <taplar> al_nz1: not offhand.  you could go back though the logs possibly
[18:58:43] <al_nz1> ok
[18:58:44] <al_nz1> ta
[18:58:47] <taplar> roflmyeggo: heh, pie in the sky, :P
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> roflmyeggo that'd be really confusing tbh
[18:59:15] <taplar> iirc, jquery mobile does some vClick stuff, but that's kinda a big pull in just to get vClick
[18:59:54] <taplar> what's wrong with on('click tap', ...) ?
[19:00:23] <roflmyeggo> taplar: triggered twice possibly i believe
[19:00:28] <taplar> how?
[19:01:07] <taplar> are you seeing a problem, or are you thinking there will be a problem?
[19:02:22] <roflmyeggo> taplar: SO answer said to watch out for it
[19:02:38] <roflmyeggo> but, i will test further ^_^
[19:02:44] <taplar> ^^^
[19:04:22] <taplar> i could be wrong, but from my experience if you're not using another library, click doesn't trigger a touchstart/touchend and vise versa
[19:05:14] <taplar> and with that, my azz is going 'ome
[19:44:58] <al_nz1> what about doing it this way : https://jsfiddle.net/b68ccamc/14/
[19:46:51] <robertmaxrees> that's another way, but I'm not a fan of clone in cases like this personally.
[19:47:32] <al_nz1> because?
[19:48:02] <robertmaxrees> if you ever want to modify or change the markup, you can't.
[19:48:31] <robertmaxrees> also semi expensive to go into the DOM, copy a bunch of markup + handlers, and then paste all that in.
[19:48:38] <robertmaxrees> but if it works... (shrug)
[19:49:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't really seem interested in our input soooo.
[19:51:05] <al_nz1> no I am totally into examining all the options
[19:51:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:51:16] <al_nz1> and understanding the implications of each
[19:51:20] <al_nz1> thats why i asked
[19:51:27] <robertmaxrees> you just keep asking for input and then not doing what we're suggesting so i don't understand why you're still asking for input.
[21:08:03] <jak2000> wich plugin recommend me use While an ajax request, show something a progress bar or a ssimilar? thanks
[21:24:28] <killer> hey , i can't figure out why 'pageshow' button is not working , I have been googling it since long , http://pastebin.com/znXaYaCZ
[22:00:21] <kyndel> for some reason $("#myDiv").scrollTop(0) is not working
[22:01:00] <kyndel> and when i do console.log("#myDiv").scrollTop()) i get "undefined"
[22:40:53] <hellyeah> yo
[23:02:26] <dddh_> kyndel: try $('#myDiv') from console
[23:13:22] <kyndel> dddh_: it printed []
[23:17:16] <dddh_> kyndel: probably there are no elements with id="myDiv"
[23:18:39] <kyndel> look at this example please https://jsfiddle.net/mhmad7pg/
[23:18:49] <kyndel> why does this not work?
[23:19:57] <SailorRr> can anyone help me out? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40094181/mvc-5-with-datatables-not-working-with-ajax-request
[23:20:12] <SailorRr> datatables and ajax seem to be incompatible lol
[23:20:29] <SailorRr> as in I cant figure out how to modify my mvc action to spit out what datatables wants
[23:28:20] <Alturic> Hey guys, can anyone point me in the right direction to convert entities? I'm trying to set a var name = data['zipcode_name'] and ' is being displayed as entities, &#039;
[23:33:52] <kyndel> solved my problem, i was using the wrong selector
[23:34:51] <Alturic> I have it converting the entities by doing $('<div/>').html(data['zipcode_name']).text(); but that just seems odd using a "fake" <div> element?
