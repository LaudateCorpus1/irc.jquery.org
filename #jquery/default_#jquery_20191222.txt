[11:18:08] <bestdesign> hi
[11:19:02] <bestdesign> how can detect if an input write a number? with keyCode and whitch and key
[11:19:07] <bestdesign> so three? in one time?
[11:25:51] <pavonia> Not sure I understand correctly, but you probably want .on("input", ...) and then use parseInt in the handler
[11:31:53] <bestdesign> pavonia: thanks
[11:31:56] <bestdesign> i have something this
[11:31:59] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/bxw2j01y/
[11:32:07] <bestdesign> on first want to detect if write numbers
[11:32:19] <bestdesign> and on second letters only but not really want to work any idea?
[11:32:58] <Uhkis> regex.
[11:33:31] <bestdesign> i try with event.which || event.key
[11:36:18] <pavonia> bestdesign: What if the user pastes a number with Ctrl-V?
[11:38:43] <bestdesign> pavonia: the main think i want do append a text to not possible write letters on first input
[11:38:53] <bestdesign> just numbers
[11:39:03] <bestdesign> is not to prevent
[11:39:06] <bestdesign> just a message
[11:39:40] <pavonia> You will still not detect that correctly
[11:40:42] <pavonia> Also, event.key is a number which has the ASCII code of the character assigned, I think
[11:51:29] <bestdesign> pavonia: why i need to detect paste?
[11:53:11] <pavonia> For better usability?
[11:53:28] <pavonia> Depends on what you really want to do
[12:19:32] <bestdesign> pavonia: i think to disable paste
