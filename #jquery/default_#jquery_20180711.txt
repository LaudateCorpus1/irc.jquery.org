[02:22:17] <Cork> JohnDoe2: it most likely mean you have the plugin at the end of your body and the ready is earlier
[02:49:00] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/hje4q80o/  help me please
[02:49:21] <Rockwood> my table not covers full width of div
[02:51:52] <Cork> it does, but you specify that each td can only be 5%
[02:52:34] <Rockwood> suppose i have 2.5 for each td
[02:53:05] <Cork> also you specify the table to be a block not a table
[02:53:10] <Cork> so the tr won't stretch
[03:46:29] <AL13N_work> i want to use the .is(':last-child') to find out if i'm the last child, but I want to know if it's the last child of all the .foobar class children?
[03:46:53] <AL13N_work> I can't just do .is('.foobar:last-child')
[03:47:16] <Cork> you're missing the space
[03:47:21] <AL13N_work> space?
[03:47:27] <Cork> .is('.foobar :last-child')
[03:47:50] <AL13N_work> isn't the .foobar the class of the parent?
[03:48:07] <Cork> .is('.foobar:last-child') would check if you have the class .foobar AND is the last child of your parent
[03:48:23] <AL13N_work> <div><div class="foobar" /><div class="foobar" /><div class="endclass" /></div>
[03:48:54] <AL13N_work> ah, so the space would work? gonna try that...
[03:48:58] <Cork> so you want to check if the previous sibling has the class?
[03:49:21] <Cork> cause that is what the xhtml you showed mean
[03:49:36] <AL13N_work> i want to know if the second is the last div that is .foobar
[03:49:59] <Cork> the second is the last??
[03:50:08] <AL13N_work> basically, the last-child as if the endclass one would not be there
[03:50:26] <AL13N_work> <div><div id="a" class="foobar" /><div id="b" class="foobar" /><div id="c" class="endclass" /></div>
[03:50:28] <Cork> could you make a jsfiddle showing the two cases?
[03:50:48] <AL13N_work> at some point, this == "b" and i want to check if it's the last child that has .foobar
[03:50:49] <Cork> and avoid the xhtml syntax
[03:50:51] <AL13N_work> it should be try
[03:51:04] <AL13N_work> k
[03:51:08] <AL13N_work> that might be better
[03:51:37] <Cork> most browsers don't support it for all tags, so it is generally better to not use it
[03:51:58] <AL13N_work> ow
[03:52:33] <Cork> <script src="" /> will be read as <script src=""> (without a closing tag)
[03:52:37] <Cork> for example
[03:52:39] <Cork> there are more
[03:53:34] <AL13N_work> http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/394649/
[03:53:57] <Cork> that isn't what i asked for
[03:54:26] <Cork> make tow child sets, showing where the selector should match and one where it shouldn't
[03:54:46] <AL13N_work> tow child sets ?
[03:54:47] <Cork> (or if it can be in the same set the two elements where it should and shouldn't)
[04:01:19] <AL13N_work> Cork: is this what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/394681/
[04:02:03] <Cork> not really
[04:02:09] <Cork> i think at least
[04:02:39] <Cork> AL13N_work: you should show the case where it should do the marking and one where it shouldn't
[04:02:53] <AL13N_work> i want B to be red background
[04:03:07] <Cork> in this exact case?
[04:03:37] <AL13N_work> yes, in the each case i want to know if this is the last child that is foobar class
[04:04:02] <AL13N_work> i know i can do .foobar:last  but that's not what i want to do here
[04:04:30] <AL13N_work> ah, i know
[04:06:55] <Cork> ah, ok and it can be more then two of .foobar?
[04:07:19] <AL13N_work> ah, jes
[04:07:29] <AL13N_work> like this http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/394734/
[04:08:04] <Cork> so you so you want c to be marked here http://jsfiddle.net/Ld5wmtk3/ ?
[04:08:53] <AL13N_work> exactly
[04:11:31] <Cork> so http://jsfiddle.net/wse5poqn/
[04:12:44] <AL13N_work> ok, thanks, i'll do it like that
[05:54:09] <Anamol> [15:39] <Anamol> how to check how much part of the div is visible to window?
[05:54:40] <Cork> you mean how much of the element is visible in the viewport?
[05:55:29] <Anamol> yeah
[05:56:26] <Cork> $(window).height(), window.scrollX and $(window).width(), window.scrollY
[05:57:12] <Cork> then check if .position() of the element is outside those values (plus .height(), .width() for the right and bottom values)
[05:58:42] <Cork> though note that check won't account for parts of the element hidden by other elements with overflow or position absolute element
[05:59:20] <Anamol> ahh so complex
[06:00:44] <Cork> ya, you will have to check every element with overflow in the parent chain
[06:00:59] <Cork> and then ontop of that add each element with position fixed or absolute
[06:01:21] <Cork> and this is why it is normally something ppl avoid :)
[06:03:57] <Anamol> can u suggest me a efficient logic to my problem?
[06:04:04] <Anamol> i think this one is pretty complicated
[06:04:20] <Cork> you haven't said what it is you're trying to solve
[06:05:31] <Anamol>  i  have a div with some text that has a 2second timeout , after 2s that div's width is decreased and only certain part is visible
[06:06:01] <Anamol> height*
[06:06:32] <Cork> ok, and?
[06:06:47] <Anamol> i want to set the height of the div to the point where user has scrolled or isvisible in the viewport
[06:06:55] <Anamol> so it doesnt effect the user experience
[06:07:23] <Cork> so you mean you want to have it avoid overflow?
[06:08:49] <Anamol> no i mean if the user has scrolled or is reading the part that will be hidden after 2s
[06:09:13] <Anamol> i want my div's height to be set at the part where user is reading it
[06:09:16] <Cork> you could just check the scrollTop of the overflow element
[06:09:29] <Cork> and disable the hide timer if scrollTop > 10 or something like that
[06:09:47] <Cork> (don't make it 0 cause then it will be fiddely)
[06:10:37] <Anamol> can u check my js code
[06:11:22] <Anamol> i wrote  a logic that adds the yscroll amount to div's height
[06:11:26] <Anamol> but its not working perfect
[06:12:51] <Cork> will have to check after lunch in that case
[06:14:23] <Anamol> http://jsfiddle.net/vL297xmw/
[06:14:25] <Anamol> check it when you're free
[06:48:20] <Anamol> Cork
[06:48:57] <AdamPDotty> Guess again!
[07:06:28] <pagios> can i embed an iframe in an iframe in an iframe in an iframe?
[07:07:13] <Cork> each iframe is a new page so there isn't any limitation unless the parent pages iframe forbid iframes (or the child page forbids embedding)
[07:30:51] <konrados> pagios: notice that the inside frame will work 20x faster, the inside-inside 20*20x faster etc.
[07:31:38] <Cork> what?
[07:34:20] <konrados> Cork: don't tell me you haven't seen Inception :)
[07:34:42] <Cork> ah, i thought you where serious there for a while...
[07:34:48] <konrados> Nope :)
[07:35:20] <konrados> I just thought about the movie when they said about iframe in an iframe in an iframe in...
[07:35:53] * Cork nods
[07:59:27] <ben69> hello
[07:59:47] <ben69> i'm trying to add en element into a <template>
[07:59:59] <ben69> and that doesn't work ...
[08:03:53] <Cork> interesting... never tried that
[08:04:08] <Cork> template is meant to be kept as a string, that might be the cause
[08:10:52] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y7yscapx
[08:10:54] <khobo> so close....
[08:10:57] <khobo> getting this lazyload working
[08:11:02] <khobo> any idea why it loads everything at once?
[08:11:38] <ben69> i get a TypeError: adown is null when i try to do a .after() inside my template
[08:18:39] <Cork> khobo: ya, just tested it and template content isn't dom
[08:19:06] <Cork> that is the hole point of the template tag, to not have a bunch of dom elements in the tree that isn't needed
[08:19:23] <khobo> wait, soooo
[08:19:27] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5j8d32sx/4/
[08:19:30] <khobo> what's this mean
[08:19:43] <Cork> khobo: it means that just modify the string
[08:20:22] <khobo> wait, what?
[08:20:44] <khobo> there's no template
[08:21:27] <khobo> i think you're confusing me with someone else
[08:22:45] <Cork> correct i meant ben69
[08:23:18] <Cork> do you have a jsfiddle or similar with the code?
[08:23:26] <khobo> me or ben?
[08:23:45] <Cork> man i'm bad at this today >_<
[08:23:51] <Cork> the last was for you...
[08:24:27] <Cork> (i'm usually manic about prefixing when i switch who i address but not right now...)
[08:25:29] <AdamPDotty>  *this one goes out to the one I left behind*
[08:26:10] <khobo> lol
[08:26:13] <khobo> cork: https://jsfiddle.net/w9eurt8h/4/
[08:26:18] <khobo> it totally works on jsfiddle...
[08:26:27] * Cork blames the mind frying by fiddling with vat validation...
[08:26:33] <khobo> but it's conflicting with my preexisting code im guessing
[08:27:01] <Cork> ya, that is often a problem
[08:27:13] <Cork> but hunting down what that can be can take a long time :/
[08:27:26] <khobo> luckily there's not much happenign on the page
[08:27:27] <khobo> one sec
[08:28:00] <Cork> doesn't become better by the fact that i hate lazy loading scripts
[08:29:02] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/w9eurt8h/8/
[08:29:08] <khobo> i mean i really think it works
[08:29:12] <khobo> for what im trying to do here
[08:29:20] <khobo> like this long line of images
[08:29:21] <khobo> i need something
[08:29:37] <khobo> does that work for you?
[08:29:41] <ben69> cork, i didi it in vanilla javascript
[08:29:44] <khobo> i think it works for me? but is jumpy
[08:30:19] <Cork> khobo: i'm on a very fast connection, and my computer is fast so i'm not sure there is much i can see :)
[08:30:34] <khobo> it should load on viewport
[08:30:35] <Cork> at least not with so few images
[08:30:46] <khobo> like.. if its hidden it shouldnt load until you scroll down
[08:30:54] <khobo> it should do a fade in too
[08:30:55] <khobo> so you can see
[08:31:46] <AdamPDotty> on first scroll pictures were just there. after a while I scrolled again, then got green acres and pictures faded in.
[08:32:28] <AdamPDotty> and seems I have to wait a while and then scroll fast
[08:33:22] <AdamPDotty> also looks like pictures flash on before fading in
[08:42:50] <khobo> AdamPDotty: i know man
[08:42:53] <khobo> any way to fix this?
[08:42:57] <khobo> any alternatives i could employ?
[08:43:02] <khobo> maybe you guys have some code i could scrap from?
[08:56:00] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know how to send the picture to the server in these docs in the section 'upload'? https://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/
[08:58:23] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: only guessing but i suspect it is meant to be as the normal form submission
[08:59:47] <KnightsOfNi> I want to do it with ajax, can I just serialize the form?
[09:00:13] <Cork> if you want to ajax upload a file input you need to use FormData
[09:00:36] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData
[09:00:59] <KnightsOfNi> It's built into js?
[09:01:10] <Cork> it is built into browsers
[09:08:18] <KnightsOfNi> Why does jquery not utilize it ?
[09:09:01] <Cork> cause you can't send data the same way as jquery has done since long before it existed
[09:09:05] <Cork> you can use it with $.ajax though
[09:09:14] <Cork> (or $.post for that matter)
[09:09:54] <Cork> actually, sorry you can't use $.post
[09:10:07] <Cork> you need to set processData and contentType to false for it to work
[09:12:10] <KnightsOfNi> oh ok
[09:12:13] <KnightsOfNi> Let me try
[09:14:02] <KnightsOfNi> So should I pass that formdata object as value for the data parameter in the ajax call?
[09:16:39] <KnightsOfNi> Cork: https://gist.github.com/kylescousin/5a669a1950cf202156929661d30a231b
[09:16:41] <KnightsOfNi> Like that?
[09:17:13] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: ya, if you do it from a submit event in the form you can just do new FormData(this) though
[09:17:44] <KnightsOfNi> It's more like a save button, it doesn't generate a submit
[09:22:00] <KnightsOfNi> Hm, odd... when I look at the request objects on the server side, it's empty...
[09:22:04] <KnightsOfNi> it didn't send any data
[09:27:10] <KnightsOfNi> Any idea where it is Cork?
[09:28:07] <KnightsOfNi> Actually when I log this to console: new FormData(document.getElementById('my-settings-avatar')
[09:28:09] <KnightsOfNi> it's empty
[09:30:46] <nebulae> HI all all. Is there any to check if a value exists in a table without iterating the table?  I tried .has() so far
[09:34:29] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: is document.getElementById('my-settings-avatar') actually finding the form?
[09:34:52] <Cork> (note you can _not_ give it the input field)
[09:39:23] <KnightsOfNi> Yes it gives the form html if I log it
[09:40:38] <KnightsOfNi> This is what I have: https://gist.github.com/kylescousin/6047c6f8ea5536da257429f731be4f81
[09:41:06] <KnightsOfNi> God I hate javascript
[09:42:03] <Cork> hmm, if you're not getting the file server side with that ...
[09:42:19] <Cork> then the file picker doesn't have an image...
[09:42:29] <Cork> not sure what is going on there, but that should work
[09:42:42] <Cork> (though line 18-23 isn't needed)
[09:43:20] <KnightsOfNi> I'm using this thing Cork: https://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/
[09:43:43] <KnightsOfNi> There is a section at the bottom where they have an example about a file upload, but they don't implement the server part
[09:43:58] <Cork> they don't even implement the sending part
[09:44:12] <Cork> server part isn't really something the lib should explain
[09:44:19] <Cork> as it differ from server language to language
[09:44:33] <KnightsOfNi> Yeah but they could add the ajax call or something
[09:45:00] <Cork> from what the code looks like it doesn't require it to be ajax
[09:45:10] <Cork> so that would be giving wrong information
[09:45:28] <KnightsOfNi> I don't understand how to send it to the server then
[09:46:30] <Cork> ah
[09:46:40] <Cork> you prob crash on append line
[09:46:45] <Cork> as you don't have an input defined
[09:47:08] <Cork> also just realized, you don't have a name on the file input field
[09:47:12] <Cork> so it can't be addressed
[09:48:33] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: http://jsfiddle.net/zncdjm32/4/
[09:49:06] <Cork> though you have submit buttons without what looks like submit events so... you have quite a bit of problem here
[09:49:10] <KnightsOfNi> Ugh
[09:50:37] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: http://jsfiddle.net/zncdjm32/5/
[09:50:52] <Cork> opps
[09:51:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zncdjm32/6/
[09:51:09] <Cork> that is how i would have expected the code to look like
[09:52:30] <KnightsOfNi> let's see...
[09:56:37] <KnightsOfNi> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/zncdjm32/9/ - I logged the formdata object here
[09:56:40] <KnightsOfNi> with your code
[09:56:45] <KnightsOfNi> But it seems to be empty
[09:57:19] <Cork> you can't access the formdata
[09:57:26] <Cork> it is a protected object in the browser
[09:57:44] <Cork> you can view what the browser submitted in the request in the network tab though
[09:57:59] <Cork> and there it show up correctly
[09:58:35] <KnightsOfNi> Payload: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="jEHzFrt.jpg"
[09:58:35] <KnightsOfNi> Content-Type: image/jpeg
[09:58:41] <KnightsOfNi> so it is sent?
[10:00:33] <KnightsOfNi> Yes it works :)
[10:00:53] <KnightsOfNi> I don't understand why you can't log the FormData object though
[10:01:49] <KnightsOfNi> Thanks Cork
[10:03:04] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: when formdata was added it was so javascript could send local files to a server without risking the data getting released to javascript
[10:03:11] <Cork> something that wasn't allowed then
[10:03:22] <Cork> it has changed a bit since, but that was the reason
[10:03:45] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[10:59:47] <David________> Buenas tardes

[11:14:54] <KnightsOfNi> Cork, are you still there?
[11:18:44] <KnightsOfNi> Apparently the file that is sent is not the cropped file, it's just the original
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[13:29:25] <taplar> fun times
[13:30:03] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:36:32] <DarkArtist69> having an issue with a popup modal button... the popup opens fine and can close but if you open it and scroll the popup disapears and it can not be re opened with the button. How can I correct his or what should I search for
[13:36:59] <robertmaxrees> what modal are you using?  can you provide a test case?
[13:37:44] <DarkArtist69> https://energypromocodes.com/ check out the "case study" button or "whats the catch?" buttons
[13:39:18] <robertmaxrees> have you opened your js console?
[13:40:14] <DarkArtist69> yes am looking at that now.. I didnt create this, just trying to correct the issue...
[13:40:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:40:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:42:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing nested event bindings.
[13:42:33] <robertmaxrees> which is scary.
[13:42:48] <DarkArtist69> i see the code for the click but am I am not certain what to use to correct it...
[13:43:02] <DarkArtist69> it is creating a conflict ?
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> stuff like jQuery('.ui-widget').bind('click', function() { inside of another click handler is bad.
[13:45:05] <DarkArtist69> how should it work? is that create the scroll issue?
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> diod you add the scroll?
[13:45:24] <robertmaxrees> *did
[13:45:43] <DarkArtist69> i have not added anything...
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> because that looks like it's caused by using .hide() instead of using the dialog close.
[13:48:18] <DarkArtist69> ok, so other than the nested part, if we changed close to hide it might not have that issue anymore?... is there anyway to tell here this code actually is?
[13:48:31] <robertmaxrees> change hide to close
[13:48:36] <robertmaxrees> and what code?
[13:50:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean how can you tell that's the code to be looking at?
[13:50:30] <DarkArtist69> wait when I look at the code for say, the case study...from 272 to 283.. i dont see Hide... i see it say dialog (close)
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> you're jumping around.
[13:50:58] <DarkArtist69> is that the part you are referring to?
[13:51:16] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e74029719f11
[13:51:21] <DarkArtist69> sorry i dont mean to be confusing..
[13:51:25] <robertmaxrees> this is likely what's causing your issues on scroll.
[13:52:03] <DarkArtist69> Oh i see it now, under all that part...
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong way to do that.
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> you don't use .hide() for that.  you use .close()
[13:53:48] <DarkArtist69> now i just need to figure out where that code is... this is a wordpress site and not 100% where they even put this
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> it looks like they just pasted it into some template file.
[13:54:10] <robertmaxrees> it should really be in a js file instead.
[13:54:11] <DarkArtist69> gotcha, that makes total since ... considering the other parts above are using close and not hide..
[13:54:28] <DarkArtist69> i agree...
[13:58:21] <DarkArtist69> FOUND IT :) .. hehe..
[13:58:33] <DarkArtist69> and it was just pasted in to a template..
[13:59:05] <robertmaxrees> like I said ;)
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:00:55] <DarkArtist69> It works!... thank you so much...
[14:02:26] <DarkArtist69> when you get back, can you tell me or show me where yo find a better way than the nesting ?...
[14:38:35] <DarkArtist69> robertmax
[14:38:42] <DarkArtist69> oops, sry
[14:46:31] <DarkArtist69> robertmaxrees: thank you

I've done it with previous filters, but for some reason this one keeps coming back as "false" for all results, even when it should match. I don't know what I've done wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/3ftzjrv1/
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:50:29] <robertmaxrees> why do you have a greb a loop?
[14:50:55] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to filter the workingPDShells array by the name of the objects.
[14:51:08] <robertmaxrees> also: wrong for loops for an array :L)
[14:51:43] <robertmaxrees> so you want all workingPDShells that match a particular deliveryType?
[14:52:31] <tsukasadt> Yeah. In the full script, the workingPDShells array is dynamically generated.
[14:52:43] <robertmaxrees> why the .grep here btw?
[14:52:52] <robertmaxrees> why not a good ol .forEach and a filter?
[14:53:05] <tsukasadt> It's what I was taught to use for advanced filtering.
[14:53:25] <robertmaxrees> any browser restrictions?
[14:53:29] <robertmaxrees> or is ES5 good enough?
[14:54:11] <tsukasadt> ES5 is fine, but I don't see what the issue is. The $.grep() and for() works, it's the RegExp().test() that's failing.
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> except that for loop isn't what you want for arrays.
[14:55:06] <taplar> heh, i got it to return true with: course.name.split(' ').indexOf(filter) > -1
[14:55:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/3ftzjrv1/8/
[14:55:52] <tsukasadt> Changing it to for(var i = 0; i < request.deliveryTypes.length; i++) doesn't change the outcome.
[14:55:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like this.
[14:56:36] <taplar> only issue with that would be if the text was at the beginning or end, no?
[14:56:48] <robertmaxrees> taplar he wants a specific part of the string :)
[14:56:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:57:08] <taplar> right, i'm just thinking genericly
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> back
[14:59:13] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I was using the regex to avoid http://jsfiddle.net/3ftzjrv1/12/, where the value isn't in the middle of the name.
[14:59:37] <robertmaxrees> that's an off data source.
[14:59:39] <robertmaxrees> *odd
[14:59:40] <robertmaxrees> but ok
[14:59:42] <taplar> yeah so you can split on ' ', and then do index of, like i did
[15:00:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:02:10] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/3ftzjrv1/17/
[15:04:37] <taplar> you could even throw in an includes shim and use includes
[15:05:57] <tsukasadt> I reworked the for() into the forEach() and the split().indexOf() seems to be doing the trick. I just don't understand why the RegExp().test() was calling false. :S
[15:06:25] <tsukasadt> ty for the help, taplar and robertmaxrees!
[15:06:35] <taplar> regex weirdness
[15:06:58] <taplar> i'm not familiar enough with \b to really say one way or the other
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> tbh avoid regex :)
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> especially in cases like this where you donm'
[15:08:27] <robertmaxrees> *don't need it.
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use for loops.
[15:09:15] <tsukasadt> taplar, /\bOG\b/.test('WORKING OG BUS121 Introduction to Business 7.2.2018 PD EDITOR') = true while new RegExp('\b' + deliveryType + '\b').test('WORKING OG BUS121 Introduction to Business 7.2.2018 PD EDITOR') = false. It's so weird.
