[04:15:57] <gAb1> hi, why doesn't val() work with input type date and time? https://jsfiddle.net/20xhjbkp/1/
[04:21:59] <Cork> gAb1: date fields take the time in the format yyyy-mm-ddTDD-nn-SS
[04:22:46] <Cork> opps that is datetime, date is YYYY-MM-DD
[04:22:53] <Cork> no no am/pm
[04:24:28] <gAb1> oh so i need to get year month and day separate?
[04:24:37] <Cork> no
[04:24:48] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/38xogmsk/1/
[04:24:57] <Cork> but it has to be the iso format
[04:25:21] <Cork> (this is not jquery btw it is the web standard for date fields)
[04:25:49] <Cork> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#input-author-notes
[04:26:05] <gAb1> oh ok, i'll use toISOString() then
[04:29:49] <gAb1> what about time fields? https://jsfiddle.net/20xhjbkp/2/
[04:39:26] <Cork> gAb1: i answered that first
[04:39:32] <Cork> also see the link i gave you
[06:09:37] <codecutter> which solution is ideal for twitter, facebook like messaging service (1-to-1 conversation e.g. direct messaging), long polling, sse, or websocket?
[06:13:19] <gAb1> Cork: yes i was just sleepy
[06:14:03] <gAb1> is there a method for checking if certain value exists in a object with multiple entries?
[06:17:52] <codecutter> cork any suggestions?
[06:17:57] <codecutter> i'm using sse in website, it not possible use sse for the app because endpoint is secured with oauth2 and event source does not allow headers
[06:21:09] <pavonia> gAb1: What do you mean by multiple entries?
[06:21:47] <gAb1> pavonia: like this http://typeiii.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/to-objects.html
[06:24:34] <pavonia> You can use .each() to iterate the object's name/value pairs
[06:43:53] <gAb1> can i acess jquery objects like $('input'), storing them inside an object like var object = { inputone: $('input#one'), ... }
[06:44:03] <gAb1> why's that not working?
[06:45:50] <gAb1> i mean, when i do object.inputone.val('some value') it doesn't work, and nothing in console
[06:48:27] <pavonia> What means it doesn't work?
[06:52:44] <gAb1> the value is not set in the input
[06:55:35] <pavonia> gAb1: Does it work if you use the jQuery object directly?
[06:56:46] <gAb1> https://jsfiddle.net/eygc2mkr/1/
[06:57:21] <gAb1> https://jsfiddle.net/eygc2mkr/2/
[06:59:19] <gAb1> it doesn't in the fiddle
[07:01:11] <thykka> gAb1, you haven't included jQuery in the fiddle
[07:01:40] <gAb1> ok that's why :P
[07:02:04] <thykka> also, the 'div#shop > input' isn't selecting anything, because it's a select, not an input
[07:02:40] <thykka> btw, if you're using ID-selectors, it's almost pointless to qualify with tagName too
[07:03:07] <thykka> i.e. $('div#date') should be equivalent to $('#date') in almost all cases.
[07:03:15] <pavonia> Almost? :p
[07:03:19] <gAb1> yes, it's just a habit
[07:03:46] <thykka> pavonia, they *could* be changing an element's type based on some criteria, while keeping the same ID.. Smelly, but possible
[07:04:10] <gAb1> what i don't understand here is why the object is available inside the function, but the variables are not, and they're all declared the same way
[07:05:23] <thykka> what do you mean? inside which function?
[07:06:05] <Cork> gAb1: it doesn't matter, the only think yo might get is that you get name collision
[07:06:23] <pavonia> Btw, you never pass an entry object to populate
[07:06:23] <Cork> thykka: he accesses the variables declared at the top inside populate
[07:06:39] <Cork> pavonia: its meant to be optional
[07:06:50] <Cork> that's why there is the ? check
[07:07:18] <pavonia> I don't understand the question then
[07:07:28] <gAb1> wait, nvm that last question
[07:07:31] <gAb1> the problem is
[07:07:32] <thykka> Cork, right, but they also say "the variables are not [available inside the function]", although they are available
[07:07:54] <thykka> the inputs don't get populated, because populate() is called without the argument it desperately needs
[07:07:55] <Cork> ya, and like i said, that can't be true unless there are name collisions
[07:08:00] <gAb1> https://jsfiddle.net/eygc2mkr/3/ this isn't working in local
[07:08:09] <gAb1> i'll check again the code
[07:09:07] <Cork> gAb1: equal in the function declaration isn't needed (and is only supported in es6+)
[07:09:10] <gAb1> is it just me or in that last fiddle, the date field is being populated, but the time field is not?
[07:09:40] <gAb1> ok
[07:10:55] <gAb1> thykka: what arguments does populate() need?
[07:10:59] <Cork> gAb1: the now string is invalid
[07:11:10] <Cork> for me i get "1:10:"
[07:11:33] <Cork> gAb1: https://jsfiddle.net/u3na7mby/
[07:11:58] <gAb1> hmm it was working fine in my browser
[07:12:04] <thykka> different locales have different formats, would be unwise to blindly slice with magic numbers..
[07:12:10] <Cork> ja
[07:12:34] <gAb1> oh, so how can i populate the two fields with the system date then?
[07:13:23] <Cork> gAb1: you have to populate them with iso 8601
[07:13:33] <Cork> cause it _is the only valid format_
[07:13:40] <Cork> like i told you before
[07:13:45] <gAb1> toISOString?
[07:14:05] <Cork> not for time fields
[07:37:14] <gAb1> what do you do when you copy paste your js code into a fiddle test case and for some magic reason it works in there?
[07:37:15] <gAb1> :P
[07:38:17] <Cork> gAb1: it means you need to inspect the differences between the fiddle and your original page
[07:38:33] <Cork> like if it is that jsfiddle waits for load event by default
[07:38:57] <gAb1> i literally copy pasted the js code without modifying it
[07:39:08] <gAb1> and also tried changing the jsfiddle to on ready
[07:39:15] <gAb1> the problem is in local
[07:39:34] <Cork> gAb1: jsfiddle js > "Load type": "On Load"
[07:39:45] <gAb1> it just doesn't set the date field
[07:40:04] <gAb1> the fiddle is working fine
[07:40:05] <Cork> so if you exactly copy pasted the code from your page it will run differently
[07:41:12] <gAb1> https://jsfiddle.net/uzfxn9cs/ this is the exact copy from my files
[07:41:33] <gAb1> except i'm using jquery 3.4.1
[07:42:33] <gAb1> so how do i find the problem?
[07:45:54] <Cork> gAb1: if you can't reproduce the problem look at the differences
[07:46:00] <gAb1> when i change in local from input.date to $( '#date > input' ), it works
[07:46:05] <Cork> cause it isn't in the code you pasted there
[07:46:21] <Cork> ah..
[07:46:27] <Cork> ya, so see my first suggestion
[07:46:58] <Cork> (and please start to actually read suggestions to your problems...)
[07:48:26] <gAb1> i'm reading but i can't find the one you're refering to
[07:48:31] <gAb1> you mind quoting?
[07:49:25] <Cork> "<Cork> gAb1: it means you need to inspect the differences between the fiddle and your original page
[07:49:25] <Cork> <Cork> like if it is that jsfiddle waits for load event by default"
[07:50:03] <gAb1> but the the code is exactly the same, what differences can be in a copy pasted code?
[07:50:52] <Cork> ... no it isn't exactly the same
[07:51:00] <Cork> i have stated exactly what differs...
[07:51:21] <Cork> (several times too)
[07:52:00] <gAb1> you mean the way jsfiddles executes the code?
[07:52:24] <Cork> the way jsfiddle triggers the code ya
[07:52:54] <gAb1> i tried both on load and on ready and both work fine
[07:53:14] <Cork> ya, but in your page you run the equiv of head
[07:53:25] <Cork> and $() then runs before body exists
[10:08:51] <gAb1> Cork: hmm isn't $(function () {}) the equivalnet of document ready?
[10:09:06] <Cork> gAb1: it is, but you have selectors not delayed by it
[10:09:26] <gAb1> oh
[10:09:32] <gAb1> so i just put it all inside it?
[10:09:45] <Cork> that's an option ya
[10:10:27] <Cork> that will make the function inaccessable to the rest of the page though
[10:10:34] <Cork> but if that is ok, then go ahead
[10:11:44] <gAb1> yes, i'll just put all my code in this file
[10:31:09] <gAb1> for the time, will this work for all cases? now = date.toISOString().slice(11, 16)
[10:36:47] <Cork> gAb1: i would go with (new Date()).toISOString().replace(/^.*T([0-9:]+).*$/, '$1')
[10:56:51] <gAb1> Cork: hmmm but the input type time only accepts hours and minutes
[11:01:26] <gAb1> i mean it displays the time with seconds, but the required fails
[11:11:25] <gAb1> i'm using this plugin https://github.com/typeiii/jquery-csv and it works great so far, but i have a problem that's not related to it
[11:12:15] <gAb1> i'm using http://typeiii.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/to-objects.html to read a csv file and load 1 line in a form, how can i save the changes i do to the values of the loaded csv line?
[11:13:35] <gAb1> do i just push the changes to the whole csv object and write it?
[11:13:47] <gAb1> or what would be the proper way?
[11:23:40] <Cork> gAb1: its just an array of objects, you can modify them before you store them if you like
[11:25:08] <gAb1> ok, how do i write the file?
[11:25:13] <gAb1> i've actually never done this
[11:27:30] <Cork> gAb1: you post it to the server and it stores it in a database or file
[11:27:56] <Cork> website js don
[11:28:04] <Cork> *don't have local file access
[11:29:58] <gAb1> ik it's not a website actually
[11:30:13] <gAb1> just a local app i'm gonna be using in the phone
[11:30:14] <thykka> node?
[11:30:22] <Cork> then you have to check for the enbedment your using
[11:30:38] <Cork> they normally provides none standard api hooks
[11:30:47] <gAb1> i'm getting this error XML Parsing Error: syntax error line 1 colum 1
[11:30:50] <Cork> if they don't then it is just a website
[11:31:08] <gAb1> i'm opening the file using $.get
[11:31:32] <Cork> no, you're fetching them using $.get
[11:31:37] <Cork> that isn't open
[11:31:42] <gAb1> oh
[11:31:50] <gAb1> then i can't save a local file?
[11:32:05] <Cork> not unless you have a file api in the environemnt
[11:32:27] <Cork> meaning a none standard write file api
[11:32:38] <thykka> here's how you can make and save a file in client-side js: https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/f6Ltzo05/
[11:32:38] <Cork> cause webjs (including jquery) don't have it
[11:33:03] <thykka> of course, you'll want to use text/csv, or whatever CSV's mime is
[11:33:15] <Cork> that will just pop a download dialog though
[11:33:22] <Cork> not make a file action
[11:33:42] <thykka> right, can't write into disk without user confirmation
[11:33:52] <gAb1> pff i don't have time to learn java...
[11:33:55] <Cork> well you can't access filesystem at all actually
[11:34:07] <gAb1> i wanted to write something fast for the phone...
[11:34:08] <Cork> it is just handed to the enbedment and it will do what the user chooses with it
[11:34:47] <Cork> gAb1: ya, so check what enbedment environemnt you're using, it might provide it
[11:34:59] <gAb1> you mean android?
[11:35:03] <Cork> no
[11:35:15] <Cork> what you use to embed the js you run on the phone
[11:35:35] <Cork> if it just a none priviliged webview then it IS just a webpage and you can't have any extra privs
[11:35:46] <gAb1> i was thinking about building an apk file from the html, css and js files
[11:35:48] <Cork> if it is just*
[11:36:01] <Cork> gAb1: ya, that isn't what i'm asking about
[11:36:10] <Cork> but how you embed it for the platform
[11:36:14] <gAb1> you mean the browser?
[11:36:28] <Cork> that is one option ya, or a webview or an atom or...
[11:36:34] <Cork> node.js
[11:36:35] <gAb1> oh
[11:36:36] <Cork> and so on
[11:36:50] <Cork> that platform is what can give you extra access to the system
[11:36:59] <Cork> just "js" can't
[11:37:16] <thykka> xamarin/cordova/phonegap/etc.?
