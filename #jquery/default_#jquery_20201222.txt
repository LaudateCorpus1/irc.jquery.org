[05:14:55] <forgotmynick> hello. facebook pixel code manages to track all kinds of link clicks on a website, even when some links have a prevent default. i'd like to send an event to google analytics on a click but it doesn't work because another code has preventdefault. how can i "hook" into this without modifying the existing code?
[05:43:09] <sadako> Why, after calling `$el.dialog( 'close' )` would I get `Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'` when I try to open it again through the same element reference?
[05:43:16] <sadako> it just seemingly randomly started happening
