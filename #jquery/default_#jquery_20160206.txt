[00:44:32] <CaffeinatedSky> What is a way to get a variable out of an each? I need to break the each loop by using return false; but the scope of the variable is functional (inside of the each only).
[02:47:14] <user_corrupt> I am using .val to get the values in a form, which I then store in a data object to insert into a database via AJAX. Inserting into the database works fine, but I am still working on the ability to upload images into folders on my server... here is what my data object looks like before it is sent to the server side script: https://dpaste.de/u555#L am I on the right track on the client side so far?
[03:56:07] <DexDeadly_2> im trying to update a span item in my page upon the sucessful update of my table
[03:57:16] <DexDeadly_2> nm it works thanks!
[04:21:15] <DexDeadly_2> actually i have a question I seem to have an issue
[04:45:31] <DexDeadly> I havea couple sections on my page that are forms to update differentparts of the database. However 2 of my forms are submitting I think at the same time and when trying to replace my <span with a success message its duplicating.
[04:50:17] <DexDeadly> heres the section of the codes http://pastebin.com/7s1zmB7r
[06:26:27] <rapha> Good morning
[06:28:32] <rapha> From taplar's guide on delegate event binding I understand that /any/ event a child might emit can be bound to one of its parents. Works fine with stuff like "click", but now I have an <audio> tag (with "playing" and "ended" events) and I can't seem to catch those in an <article> a couple of levels upstairs. What's going on there?
[06:41:32] <rapha> Okay, I found this here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11291651/why-dont-audio-and-video-events-bubble ... but is stealing a function from another library for this still the state of the art in 2016?
[07:00:28] <Someguy123> how do I correctly handle JSON errors? i.e. I recently added HTTP status codes to my application, but now I can't just do if(data.error) within the standard .then() block

[09:02:57] <Azure> lmao
[09:04:53] <Uhkis> lol
[09:21:22] <rapha> omg lol that was good
[09:22:21] <rapha> djpickles: sounds like the injector is clogged (might have a pressure sensor or something). Remove, clean, reinstall. But probably better to have someone do that for you :-)
[09:26:52] <djpickles> removing and cleaning it looks pretty simple tbh, but not got injector socket or torque wrench to take it out or put it back in with
[11:32:29] <Deviad> Hello
[13:05:05] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2E9RYZW why cant I use the value of var channel in my socket.on() ?

[14:04:17] <Deviad> Hello
[14:04:21] <Deviad> Is anyone in here?
[14:04:37] <Deviad> Can anyone pls have a look at my custom.js: http://www.twinklems.com:5051/news.php
[14:05:27] <Deviad> For some reason the execution flow goes past if ( phpEqCheck != 0  || htmlEqCheck !=0) { ... }
[14:05:35] <Deviad> the condition of the IF statement
[14:06:12] <Deviad> what's weird is that if I use console.log to debug phpEqCheck == 0 but it goes passes the condition...
[14:06:31] <Deviad> Can anyone tell me why is this happening?
[14:06:43] <Deviad> why this is happening*
[14:17:04] <shoky> Deviad: htmlEqCheck is 1
[18:07:16] <esaym> I assume an on change event doesn't bubble like an on click event?

[18:12:46] <esaym> graphettion: hmm, wondering what me issue is. let me look
[19:11:34] <JD-Robbs> Has anyone used http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/ and would know how to get to the image-preview data?  just want to get the size/margin/offset values of the preview function: rather than "crop" my images, I want the cropping to be simulated via an img inside a div.
[19:12:13] <JD-Robbs> While I can get the "cropped" preview rendered, I'd like the actual data/calculation from it (other than "reading" it from the DOM).
[20:57:05] <ajf-> ideas on how to select $('.class') but get the highest level elements? e.g. select #1, #2, and #3 from here: https://jsfiddle.net/Lpw777o7/
[21:41:09] <teamcoltra> Hello friends. I want to take a big json file and turn it into a simple array. I have http://pastie.org/10711807 and basically I just want video1 from each of the results and make that into an array. I don't need it done for me, but I don't know what to google to find the solution :\
[21:55:23] <teamcoltra> nvm got it, thanks :)
