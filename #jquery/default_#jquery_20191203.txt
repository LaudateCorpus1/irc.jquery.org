[14:01:08] <sharkie> hello guys
[14:01:55] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:02:23] <sharkie> i am just wondering if someone can help me wirth one strange problem
[14:02:29] <sharkie> :/
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask :)
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, go ahead and put it in the channel.
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[14:02:52] <sharkie> However i would like to remve jquery-migrate and there is no way
[14:03:15] <sharkie> i tried with code into functions.php
[14:03:20] <sharkie> and laos plugin
[14:03:20] <GrandMoffTarkin> hi, I am trying to set a value in a select dropdown via jquery on a react page using a userscript, but the change isn't registering,  $("#description").val('Meeting').change().click();   its like some event that detects the change isn't happening, I run .change().click();  but nothing, the value changes though
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> GrandMoffTarkin that's likely because jquery events and native dom events are a little different from one another.
[14:04:40] <sharkie> I need to remove it because when I updated jquery with jquery updater I have problem with scrollto function (if I download page and erase jquery-migrate it works, so i think it is problem with migrate
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> sharkie so then remove it?
[14:06:29] <sharkie> i cant
[14:06:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:06:43] <sharkie> I tried with plug in and code into functions
[14:06:49] <sharkie> it is still there
[14:06:57] <GrandMoffTarkin> robertmaxrees: when I google how to do it with JS examples that come up are with jquery
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> not clear what that means sharkie
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> GrandMoffTarkin that doens't change what I just said :)
[14:07:41] <GrandMoffTarkin> robertmaxrees: I understood what you said
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery events aren't the same as native DOM events.  you'll need to do this with native JS.
[14:08:16] <GrandMoffTarkin> I was saying im trying to find an example on google but the results are not what I am looking for
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events :)
[14:08:49] <sharkie> @robertmaxrees IDK. plugin doesn't work and this code
[14:09:01] <sharkie> https://www.narga.net/how-to-remove-jquery-migrate/
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> sharkie could you try rephrasing that last sentence?
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> GrandMoffTarkin https://stackoverflow.com/a/2856602/923919 for another example
[14:10:19] <sharkie> @robertmaxrees i used jquery migrate remover WP plug in and it didn't work
[14:10:24] <GrandMoffTarkin> thanks
[14:11:17] <robertmaxrees> sharkie so your real issue is a WP plugin doesn't do what it says it does?
[14:12:05] <sharkie> @robertmaxrees yes it doesn't remove jquery-migrate. And I can't remove it manually in config.php
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> sharkie that's not a jquery issue then.
[14:12:20] <robertmaxrees> that's a WP issue.
[14:14:17] <sharkie> robertmaxrees do you maybe have any idea what can I try
[14:14:22] <robertmaxrees> sharkie nope.
[14:14:31] <sharkie> ok. Thank you anyway
[23:48:25] <IamTrying> How to do like Microsoft Lens app? (Take any picture and it detects document A4 or small or etc etc and removes all other parts)
[23:49:19] <robertmaxrees> you... use microsoft lens?
[23:51:28] <IamTrying> https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yv6eUY6EyR8x2Hd6NB1SBWiN9HUFy0JYWYKA3VS1O_c8MNQ-oLXAZEoSpEDl0xJ9gw=w1366-h634-rw - robertmaxrees , no i want to implement exactly what Microsoft lens does for document to scan. I have random pictures in canvas and i want only the document part to save and remove all the rest
[23:52:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with what it does, but your lack of context for the question meant that I was going to offer that response :) and i get the feeling something like that is less than trivial to implement.
[23:53:41] <robertmaxrees> err, *more than trivial
