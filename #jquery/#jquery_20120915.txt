[00:07:14] <chovy> how do i get current url up to and including path, but not query string?
[00:12:47] <ccunni> chovy, do you mean window.location.href.substr(0, window.location.href.indexOf('?'))
[00:22:49] <chovy> ccunni: yeah. thanks
[01:36:57] <prishabh> if a box has a scrollbar, what's the best way to get its entire height ?
[01:40:42] <dns-away> hello
[01:40:44] <dns-away> :-)
[01:40:58] <prishabh> :)
[01:44:19] <morfin> hello
[01:45:03] <morfin> is this correct selector: $('[name^=custom\[]')?
[01:46:08] <morfin> oops i meant $('[name^="custom\["]');
[01:51:44] <Xarthok> is this a good place to ask for feedback on my thought process behind planning the coding process of a game i want to make in javascript/php? i'm relatively new to programming and want to learn several new technologies at once while coding this project, so i'm probably overlooking many things :)
[02:12:34] <Spikes> Xarthok, you can ask just to see what other people think about planning etc, that'll give you different point of view to consider
[02:22:22] <alicefreak> which jquery rating plugin are you guys used mostly?
[02:58:31] <Lucky--> http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f8741f04-bae4-4900-81c7-7c9bfb9ed1fe
[02:58:56] <Lucky--> anyone here use coffeescript?
[03:05:33] <tjz> Hello guys~!~!~
[03:08:28] <dns-away> hi;
[03:09:20] <tjz> hello
[03:15:16] <dns-away> anyone work w gimp ?
[03:18:05] <tjz> hello guys
[03:20:49] <dns-away> hello
[03:21:58] <tjz> what good jquery ui tools do you guys use?
[03:24:35] <tjz> what is your favourite popup dialog plugin? care to share?
[03:53:49] <quazimodo> guys whats the correct way to add/change a url parameter and send a new get?
[03:54:12] <quazimodo> google aint playing nice
[03:54:23] <Lucky--> LOL http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/380154_519190148095841_1034764333_n.jpg they are origami pigs for a citation.
[04:06:06] * quazimodo 
[04:06:58] * callumacrae NO
[04:08:16] <quazimodo> seriously
[04:08:21] <quazimodo> should be trivial but its not :/
[04:16:01] <ruby_on_tails> i fetch .width() of a span in my code and it gives me 18, i consolelog the same in the browser and it gives me 20(correct) why ?
[04:16:40] <ruby_on_tails> hmm i guess custom font issue
[04:22:22] <asido> anyone knows a plugin which could do something like this magazine reader here in brown background: http://issuu.com/ ?
[04:23:27] <Lucky--> asido: wordpress has tons of em
[04:24:49] <Pietertje> how can i set the background of an image to transparent ?
[04:24:53] <asido> Lucky--: does the one deployed there looks like one of them perhaps?
[04:25:09] <callumacrae> Pietertje: That aint a jQuery question
[04:25:31] <callumacrae> But you should be able to do it in PhotoShop, Illustrator, or something like that
[04:26:35] <Lucky--> hm that one is nice, but there were similar
[04:27:03] <Lucky--> asido: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-flash-page-flip/screenshots/
[04:27:15] <Lucky--> asido: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-jquery-pdf-paged/
[04:27:22] <Lucky--> just take the js from the plugin
[04:27:24] <Lucky--> and ditch the php
[04:27:53] <tjz> any example of how i use jquery to execute php script?
[04:28:01] <callumacrae> tjz: AJAX?
[04:28:12] <callumacrae> You can't run PHP client-side, though
[04:28:24] <tjz> ok
[04:28:31] <tjz> that kind of task is by ajax and not jquery...?
[04:28:35] <callumacrae> Well, not without writing an entire parser, which would take a few years
[04:28:40] <callumacrae> Okay
[04:28:47] <Lucky--> and why you would want to is beyond me . . .
[04:28:50] <Lucky--> php is junk
[04:28:51] <callumacrae> Please go learn the basics of both JavaScript and jQuery before you try to use them
[04:28:57] <callumacrae> Lucky--: Easy to deploy
[04:29:24] <Lucky--> callumcrea: I can get a .net site up faster then a lamp system, and ill bet anyone $$ on it
[04:29:42] <callumacrae> Lucky--: Funny that you brought up $$ there
[04:30:02] <tolborg> rails new blah.. nuff said
[04:30:13] <callumacrae> yeah, I like rails
[04:30:55] <Lucky--> never actually used rails personally
[04:31:15] <tolborg> you will fall in love
[04:31:34] <tolborg> and hate regular client work :)
[04:31:58] <Lucky--> is coffee script worth learning? I can code stuff out in js/jquery just fine
[04:32:30] <tolborg> coffe script is cool - it basically just removes some unneccesary syntax from js
[04:32:36] <tolborg> its very fast to learn
[04:32:49] <callumacrae> Lucky--: nononono
[04:32:56] <callumacrae> Coffeescript is horrific
[04:33:05] <callumacrae> It just hides shit from the developer and makes debugging a pain
[04:33:06] <tolborg> how come?
[04:33:13] <tolborg> oh
[04:33:16] <Lucky--> im about to start playign with nqunit
[04:34:13] <Lucky--> js is already a damn nightmare to debug lol
[04:35:06] <callumacrae> Lucky--: Yeah, imagine that with slightly different line numbers and random extra steps that you didn't put there
[04:35:41] <Lucky--> ek
[04:35:52] <Lucky--> might as well throw the idea of testing it out the window too
[04:40:09] <Pietertje> l
[05:09:36] <e-v-o> anyone with jQuery Address experience?
[05:13:49] <dabear> ?ask @ e-v-o
[05:13:49] <bot-t> e-v-o, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:15:44] <e-v-o> how do you prevent the "right click> open in new tab" in websites deep linked with jQuery Address from opening a 404 page?
[05:33:35] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone
[05:33:47] <jarr0dsz> im still battling a GET http://ectasio.dev:3000/speedmatch/6/in/select

[05:33:54] <jarr0dsz> ah sorry for the multiline ;s
[05:40:45] <jarr0dsz> argh it seems ember is messing up and i havent correctly removed it ;s
[05:40:51] <ayente> hello
[05:41:24] <e-v-o> cucu
[05:41:42] <ayente> i search to convert a .setstyle (prototype javascript ) to .css
[05:44:04] <ayente> i have write .css( 'right:' + ( $('#right_block').width() + right + 19 ) + 'px;' ); bit it"s not good
[05:44:10] <ayente> bit
[05:44:12] <ayente> but
[05:52:04] <johnkpaul> ayente: .css does not take a single string

[05:54:00] <ayente> .setstyle or similar in jquery?
[05:55:52] <ayente> because i use this sytem for float div in right this line calcul the right position fixed
[05:56:57] <ayente> in the top this postion is "right: inherit;"
[05:58:19] <ayente> when i scroll is postionrelative=>fixed  right inherit=> right: 200px; for exemple
[06:05:06] <jarr0dsz> argh this is really frustrating i have tested 20 times now with different solutions
[06:05:17] <jarr0dsz> im unable to replace the contents of a div ;(
[06:05:25] <termite> really
[06:05:31] <termite> have a fiddle
[06:05:32] <termite> ?
[06:05:39] <termite> or code
[06:05:46] <jarr0dsz> I do like this:  $.get  '/game/' + data.game_id + "/in/" +  data.location, (data) ->
[06:06:00] <jarr0dsz> wich basically just loads a portion of html without header and js inside the $page var
[06:06:40] <jarr0dsz> confirm that this works /game/1/in/start gives me the html without antyhing else.. no jquery in there or head or body or other stuff
[06:06:58] <jarr0dsz> then.. im trying to replace the content of #container with this $page
[06:07:20] <jarr0dsz> i missed the   $page = $(data) on a newline right after my first codeline i posted above sorry
[06:07:57] <termite> do a console.log("page: %s",page);
[06:08:00] <termite> after that lne
[06:08:02] <termite> line
[06:08:11] <termite> make sure that page has html
[06:08:38] <jarr0dsz> termite: this is a more simple pastie of it http://pastie.org/private/nfcupecartbf82y8n4mrw
[06:08:48] <jarr0dsz> ok thx i try
[06:09:28] <nFFF> line 2 jarr0dsz
[06:09:32] <nFFF> what is this?
[06:09:55] <jarr0dsz> arghh typo..
[06:10:05] <termite> try  $("#container").html($page)
[06:10:06] <termite> also
[06:10:10] <jarr0dsz> $.get  '/game/1/in/start'-> the typo is only in my pastie
[06:10:34] <nFFF> Im confused Ive never seen javascript written this way before
[06:10:39] <jarr0dsz> im getting a ReferenceError: page is not defined
[06:10:44] <termite> it's coffee script
[06:10:48] <nFFF> ah ok
[06:10:59] <jarr0dsz> but... i see before the console print that there is a GET to the page
[06:11:04] <nFFF> you can simply use load
[06:11:05] <jarr0dsz> so the $get line seems to work
[06:12:01] <jarr0dsz> shoudent that be console.log("page: %s", $page); ? with the $
[06:12:02] <termite> use the .html()
[06:12:03] <jarr0dsz> its the var right
[06:12:16] <jarr0dsz> i changed it to your suggestion also with .html
[06:12:18] <termite> page will be a string
[06:12:31] <termite> html will make it into elements
[06:12:33] <jarr0dsz> termite: so its without the $?
[06:13:01] <jarr0dsz> ok thx so far :P im going try and run this see what console prints out
[06:13:53] <jarr0dsz> still the reference error i shall try to remove that console line else execution is stopped
[06:14:00] <jarr0dsz> seems the contents is not saved in $page
[06:14:08] <termite> what is the exact error
[06:14:12] <nFFF> why would it though?
[06:14:17] <nFFF> You dont ever define page
[06:14:28] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/private/nfcupecartbf82y8n4mrw line 2,3 how should i fix it then? define page somehow?
[06:14:28] <nFFF> Unless coffeescript is doing it??
[06:14:37] <jarr0dsz> nFFF: no cofee isent doing that
[06:14:45] <nFFF> why are you using coffeescript
[06:14:53] <nFFF> learn vanilla js first :s
[06:14:57] <jarr0dsz> because its part of a rails project ;p
[06:15:12] <jarr0dsz> in my pastie, i do assign $data to $page right?
[06:15:58] <jarr0dsz> or $page = $.get('/my/url');
[06:16:06] <nFFF> $.get('/game/1/in/start', function(data) { console.log(data); ("#container").replaceWith(data); } );
[06:16:28] <nFFF> or ("#container").html(data);
[06:16:34] <nFFF> if you want to keep your container
[06:17:26] <termite> I think you implementing .get wrong
[06:18:16] <morfin> as i know there is load function
[06:18:22] <morfin> something like
[06:18:26] <termite> look at http://coffeescript.org/ and see how to do callbacks
[06:19:05] <morfin> $("#mydiv").load('/my/url',function(){console.log("this is callbadck");});
[06:19:44] <nFFF> either is fine
[06:19:48] <morfin> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:19:50] <nFFF> whether you use load or get
[06:19:54] <morfin> yep
[06:20:05] <nFFF> doesnt matter, but i have no idea about coffeescript
[06:20:28] <jarr0dsz> i can write it in js
[06:20:52] <jarr0dsz> and then convert it to coffee script easily, online perhaps thats better sorry for the confusion about the coffeescript
[06:21:36] <termite> I believe you want something like this
[06:21:36] <termite> $.get  '/game/1/in/start => (response)
[06:21:37] <termite>     page = response.data
[06:22:01] <termite> $.get  '/game/1/in/start' => (response)
[06:22:05] <jarr0dsz> i now have this: http://pastie.org/private/vida0sekw6xzztnoiruaq in JS
[06:22:39] <jarr0dsz> termite: yes coffee uses -> but lets just stick with the js i can easily convert it
[06:23:05] <termite> open up dev tools and look at the http reponse
[06:23:12] <termite> make use data is what you want
[06:23:28] <termite> sometimes it a property in the response
[06:23:29] <jarr0dsz> that seems tow ork
[06:23:33] <termite> ok
[06:23:40] <jarr0dsz> the last pastie ive pasted seems to work, it was the stupid $page thing ;s
[06:23:42] <jarr0dsz> was close
[06:24:04] <jarr0dsz> ah this is such a little thing but such a big difference in my app
[06:24:16] <jarr0dsz> before i did a reload of full url
[06:24:35] <jarr0dsz> so /game/start game/round1 it created very much lagg since all css jquery stuff reloaded everytime
[06:26:55] <jarr0dsz> now i only have 1 small issue i hope you guys have some suggestion for
[06:27:36] <jarr0dsz> first thing that happens when a game starts
[06:27:40] <jarr0dsz> it redirects to a certain location
[06:27:42] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/private/pkoejy7nofrab8pamkg like so
[06:27:51] <jarr0dsz> the code after the document.location.href is not executed
[06:28:09] <jarr0dsz> so the code that works in other steps is not working for the intro, any idea why that happens?
[06:28:23] <jarr0dsz> it needs to be executed, *after* the page has been reloaded i think
[06:28:33] <jarr0dsz> but its gets executed straight after the redirect when the page is still loading
[06:36:14] <jarr0dsz> so i tried   $(document).ready(function () {} after the redirect to no avail
[06:36:27] <jarr0dsz> called my replace div code inside that function
[07:29:30] <danshtr> Hi All. I am new to j*. I am learnign using the head first book. I have a question: Where is the selector $("li#myid") documented?
[07:29:53] <callumacrae> Do you understand how the function works?
[07:30:02] <callumacrae> And do you understand CSS selectors?
[07:30:09] <helllen> helllo
[07:30:15] <callumacrae> hey
[07:30:24] <helllen> I would like to use a countdown timer
[07:30:32] <danshtr> callumacrae: I think I do. I am just looking for the documentation
[07:30:54] <danshtr> of where "elemnt#id" is described
[07:31:03] <callumacrae> danshtr: The $() function returns a group of elements by their CSS selector
[07:31:23] <callumacrae> li#myid would select the <li> element with ID "myid"
[07:31:40] <danshtr> which one of : http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/  describes it?
[07:31:43] <callumacrae> I'd suggest you go read about CSS selectors, they're a fairly useful skill to have, and not that tricky to learn
[07:32:03] <callumacrae> danshtr: http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[07:33:46] <danshtr> I am not trolling, I only want to learn how to read jQuery documentation.
[07:34:05] <danshtr> Where element#id form is documented there?
[07:38:03] <helllen> someone know a nice countdown timer ?
[07:46:49] <p3rtutt1> shouldn't this code work?
[07:46:51] <coder1000> If I'm bringing in data through ".post()" and I want to use the ".click" on an id/class thats being brought in, can I do that?
[07:46:54] <p3rtutt1> https://gist.github.com/d2d55162f6cbfaf346d6
[07:48:09] <coder1000> p3rtutt1, it looks good to me
[07:48:28] <p3rtutt1> coder1000: I don't understand why is does nothing :s
[07:49:25] <raj> what's a nice, clean way to get the href of a selected tab in jqui tabs? and for that matter, what's a nice, clean way to get the id of a selected tab?
[07:50:43] <gt3> i have a $.ajax call that sends a number in the request to the server, and also uses that same number in a callback that saves it in an array, from the success response, but since it's asynchronous the numbers don't match. What can i do to make them match other than making it synchronous?
[07:51:25] <raj> gt3, I don't see why the numbers wouldn't match
[07:51:31] <raj> you're sending and receiving the same number
[07:52:35] <gt3> raj: well i'm in a loop
[07:52:55] <k1t_> hey folks
[07:52:58] <gt3> so i fire 1, 2, 3 and get back 3, 1, 2 (or whatever asynchronous random order they finish in)
[07:53:36] <gt3> but when i go to loop through again as 1,2,3, the array contains the order 3,1,2
[07:53:50] <raj> i see
[07:54:13] <raj> haven't come across the need for order in the past
[07:54:25] <raj> but fwiw, synchronous doesn't guarantee order either
[07:54:40] <gt3> true, there could always be a race condition
[07:55:03] <raj> I think deferred or promise or whatever is along hte lines of what you need
[07:55:10] <raj> but probably best to wait for someone else to answer
[07:55:47] <raj> or else, send a number along with it, so you know the order it should be in
[07:56:21] <coder1000> why does the code here http://jsfiddle.net/ecnKK/ work but on my site it doesn't?
[07:57:21] <raj> coder1000, no one can say until they see your site
[07:57:51] <rmurphey> gt3: check out $.when
[07:58:05] <rmurphey> it will let you react to the resolution of one or more async operations
[07:58:13] <gt3> thanks
[07:58:14] <coder1000> http://aircraftltd.netii.net/CAL2/
[07:58:34] <rmurphey> coder1000: have you looked in the console?
[07:58:57] <coder1000> I'm not sure how to do that?
[07:59:05] <rmurphey> ?ftj @ coder1000
[07:59:07] <bot-t> coder1000, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[07:59:12] <rmurphey> please read that
[07:59:21] <rmurphey> what browser are you using?
[07:59:27] <coder1000> chrome
[07:59:41] <rmurphey> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview
[07:59:44] <rmurphey> read both of those
[08:00:58] <rmurphey> the error is very clear once you look in the consolde
[08:01:04] <rmurphey> *console
[08:03:09] <gt3> rmurphey: that's intersting, but i think that deferring like that will slow things down which is the main reason i'm avoiding synchrnonous ajax though. If i have to wait until all the calls are done then i might as well use synchronous right?
[08:03:53] <rmurphey> gt3: it's not synchronous
[08:03:56] <rmurphey> no
[08:04:10] <rmurphey> but you *cannot* guarantee order of resolution
[08:04:19] <rmurphey> you can only specify that you want to handle resolution in a certain order
[08:04:23] <rmurphey> and that's what $.when is for
[08:04:41] <rmurphey> sync would run request 1, then run request 2, then run request 3
[08:04:52] <rmurphey> with $.when, you can run request 1, 2, and 3 at the same time
[08:04:58] <coder1000> I found something , $ is not defined.
[08:04:59] <rmurphey> and handle their resolution in your preferred order
[08:05:06] <coder1000> what does that mean
[08:05:15] <rmurphey> coder1000: it means that $ is not defined
[08:05:18] <rmurphey> are you defining it?
[08:05:23] <gt3> rmurphey: ok, i guess i just need to try it and see if it works, thanks
[08:05:27] <rmurphey> that is, are you loading jquery?
[08:06:08] <rmurphey> coder1000: what line does the console say the error is occuring on?
[08:06:17] <coder1000> rmurphey, yeah right before it
[08:06:33] <coder1000> 298 to 299
[08:06:40] <rmurphey> coder1000: what line does the console say the error is occuring on?
[08:06:53] <rmurphey> i see an error at line 170
[08:06:56] <rmurphey> jQuery is not defined
[08:07:07] <coder1000> wait
[08:07:10] <rmurphey> have you loaded jQuery prior to line 170?
[08:07:36] <rmurphey> ah when i just reloaded, now i see a different error at line 165
[08:07:44] <rmurphey> i no longer see the errors i was just seeing, did you change something?
[08:07:57] <rmurphey> also, why are you including jquery ui inline rather than in a script tag?
[08:08:12] <coder1000> yeah I was, but I don't need it
[08:08:34] <rmurphey> ok, so now the issue is that jquery does not seem to be loaded at the time you are trying to use it
[08:08:48] <rmurphey> you are loading jquery on line 284
[08:08:53] <rmurphey> but you are trying to use it on line 165
[08:09:20] <coder1000> and after 284
[08:09:41] <rmurphey> you can't use jquery before it's available
[08:10:30] <coder1000> I fixed it
[08:11:10] <coder1000> getting no errors though
[08:11:12] <coder1000> not working
[08:11:20] <rmurphey> well
[08:11:24] <rmurphey> keep debugging :)
[08:11:33] <rmurphey> there's great advice in the ftj link i sent you
[08:11:43] <coder1000> ok thanks
[08:11:55] <k1t_> does anyone have an idea of how I might force a user's cursor into draggable()? normally, you have to click and drag the element, as the method name suggests, but i want to have dragging of the element enabled by another button, so the user can drag the element around
[08:12:01] <k1t_> is this possible with draggable()?
[08:12:48] <k1t_> essentially simulating their mousedown event, but i want to keep it in that state so they have to click again to disable dragging
[08:13:28] <k1t_> not sure if im just misunderstanding what im trying to do but am having a hard time thinking of a workable approach
[08:20:58] <MasterX1> Hello everyone
[08:21:14] <raj> what's a nice, clean way to get the href of a selected tab in jqui tabs? and for that matter, what's a nice, clean way to get the id of a selected tab?
[08:26:24] <MasterX1> I got a question , I'm using some span tags to emulate the label lines from a illustration like this one http://www.lowvisionsolutions.com/images/human_eye.jpg . The problem is IDK how to make them adapt their rotation angle and width . I'm currently adapting some things by % of the viewport height  But I'm really stuck when it comes to rearranging the angle based on window size .
[08:26:27] <MasterX1> Any ideas ?
[08:27:31] <MasterX1> @raj THIS and get attribute should work , but only if you hook them to a click event or something .
[08:37:53] <codechewing> raj: The selected tab gets a class of .ui-tabs-selected, so target that, e.g. var href = $( '.ui-tabs-selected a' ).attr( 'href' );
[08:42:58] <raj> gotcha, thanks codechewing
[08:43:10] <raj> I thought there might have been a specific method
[08:43:36] <raj> codechewing, what about the latter? for getting the id of the div?
[08:45:42] <thujone>  morfin, what are you trying to do
[08:50:51] <codechewing> The divs id gets the same reference as the active tabs href. e.g. #tabs-3, but without the #
[08:51:16] <codechewing> so you could perform a quick slice to remove the #, like so; var href = $( '.ui-tabs-selected a' ).attr( 'href' ).slice(1);
[08:51:53] <codechewing> apart from you'd probably called this var id, not href!
[08:52:02] <p3rtutt1> how can I capture key press events of multiple textfields?
[08:57:02] <raj> how can I replace '-wxyz' at the end of a string with '' ?
[08:57:06] <raj> but only at the end
[09:19:44] <coder1000> I still am not able to get it to work
[09:24:25] <firstclassfuncti> let's give up web development; go back to desktop apps
[09:25:34] <coder1000> I still am not able to get it to work, http://aircraftltd.netii.net/CAL2/
[09:28:04] <coder1000> Could someone help me again
[09:32:32] <coder1000> please I need help
[09:34:58] <firstclassfuncti> what are use cases of using the $().data()?
[09:35:53] <rmurphey> coder1000: what are you expecting to happen, and what is happening instead?
[09:36:55] <rmurphey> for example, it looks like you are expecting initialCalendar to run when the body loads -- have you verified that it is running?
[09:36:57] <Nomikos> firstclassfuncti: there are /many/
[09:37:14] <rmurphey> also, i'm not clear that you're using jquery at all?
[09:38:05] <Nomikos> firstclassfuncti: one thing I use it for is <form ... data-objectname='product'>, and then have a generic deletebutton confirm dialog that says "Are you sure you want to delete "+form.data('objectname') +"?"
[09:41:50] <ansolas> is there a trick to make the mousewheel usable under osx ?
[09:42:07] <ansolas> if i just touch the mosuewheel 3 mouse events get fired
[09:42:12] <ansolas> totally insane
[09:42:37] <appel> i thought there was only one mouse button on macs
[09:42:54] <ansolas> i tried to block all upcoming event after one for a certain time but that did not do the trick
[09:43:04] <ansolas> i am talking of wheel
[09:43:44] <ansolas> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/qhhh8/
[09:43:52] <ansolas> try the wheel on this example on a mac
[09:43:54] <ansolas> :)
[09:44:04] <ansolas> on windows is runny very very nice
[09:44:09] <ansolas> on mac is sucks
[09:47:30] <appel> anyone know what eventObject.view is?
[09:48:05] <appel> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ does not explain it
[09:51:13] <anda> Hello, anyone knows how could i make a text appear when hovering on something?
[09:52:38] <appel> appear how?
[09:53:01] <appel> $('#element').hover(function( ) { ... show text .. }); ?
[09:55:26] <firstclassfuncti> Nomikos: oh sweet, is the data-objectname part only for HTML5?
[09:57:21] <anda> appel
[09:57:31] <anda> i will try that
[09:58:00] <appel> $('#something').hover(function() { $('#text').show(); });
[09:58:12] <appel> that's what you want
[09:58:59] <anda> yes i think give me a moment i will test it
[09:59:22] <Nomikos> firstclassfuncti: I .. think so yeah. Surprisingly many browsers seem to support it
[09:59:47] <Nomikos> firstclassfuncti: it's great for just stuffing extra attributes and meta data into any element
[10:00:36] <Nomikos> firstclassfuncti: don't use upper/mixed case for the name, after "data-"thispart though
[10:03:39] <anda> appel this is what i have, the text can  only appear when hovering on the image not always stay there  http://jsfiddle.net/pBafL/
[10:07:20] <appel> updated, it should work
[10:07:24] <appel> but i guess jsfiddle is retardd
[10:09:14] <appel> yup, it's official, does not work on jsfiddle, but works in my browser
[10:09:50] <appel> well, you didnt have jquery selected idiot
[10:09:52] <appel> :)
[10:09:59] <appel> http://jsfiddle.net/pBafL/2/
[10:11:32] <anda> ohhh
[10:11:35] <anda> i see thanks lol
[10:12:11] <Nomikos> you want http://jsfiddle.net/pBafL/3/ ?
[10:12:33] <defaultro_> our Report button on the form is very intermittent or maybe, the other team changed something yesterday. This was previously working and now the form wouldn't go away/disappear after I click the Report button.  I put a breakpoint inside close function and Firebug was able to go inside close function. http://jsfiddle.net/967Kh/
[10:13:01] <anda> Nomikos yes
[10:13:08] <anda> thank you for adding that
[10:13:26] <anda> thats what i mean,when mouse out make it dissapear
[10:13:31] <anda> Thanks
[10:13:34] <Nomikos> np :)
[10:13:57] <Nomikos> it's a hover thing, two functions, one for mouseover, one for mouseout
[10:19:53] <motaka2> no one is here ?
[10:21:22] <motaka2> previously this code $("input[name=id_water_centers]").attr("disabled", true);
[10:21:22] <motaka2>             $("input[name=id_water_centers]").val("");    was just making a field empty but recently I see that it seems it removes the whole field that means it shows the disabled field but when I submit the form it doesnt appear in $_POST
[10:28:03] <ericw> Lucky--: what are you up to this morning?
[10:28:28] <ericw> you sleep at all? lol
[10:44:19] <motaka2> ericw: are you there?
[10:45:08] <ericw> yeah
[10:45:22] <ericw> motaka2: wish i wasn't
[10:45:35] <ericw> spending this weekend working. -.-
[10:45:52] <ericw> i have a deadline for the cloud blog to be presentable and able to be made live by monday
[10:46:02] <motaka2> ericw: it's always better to have something to do rather than nothing
[10:46:35] <ericw> true
[10:46:43] <ericw> but i can think of a million things i could be doing on my saturday
[10:46:48] <ericw> like a cute little chinese girl that's waiting for me. ;)
[10:46:55] <ericw> or the mexican one..
[10:47:00] <ericw> :x
[10:47:16] <jarr0dsz> hi guys im still trying to fix an issue where my code is not executing after a document.location change
[10:47:28] <jarr0dsz> ive used a reload function still it won't execute my code any ideas how one could debug that?
[10:48:13] <motaka2> ericw: $("input[name=id_water_centers]").attr("disabled", true);  behaves somehow that it does not exist in the form , i look foe an equivalent for it that does not behave like that and when I var_dump($_POST) I get it as a field too. Do you know some thing equivalent ?
[10:48:22] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz, can't really help with so little information
[10:48:24] <ericw> i don't even know any programming languages
[10:48:26] <ericw> lol
[10:48:28] <ericw> ;)
[10:48:40] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: im making a pastie now
[10:48:50] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: do you have any idea baout my problem ?
[10:49:08] <ericw> but in all seriousness, i'm here because i know very very little about jquery/js
[10:49:31] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: i did not see it, please again
[10:49:48] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: $("input[name=id_water_centers]").attr("disabled", true); behaves somehow that it does not exist in the form , i look foe an equivalent for it that does not behave like that and when I var_dump($_POST) I get it as a field too. Do you know some thing equivalent ?
[10:50:16] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: something like this : http://pastie.org/private/xccozskcjiavlc3vue2g
[10:50:27] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: try to log it, see if your selection is picking it up.. console.log( $("input[name=id_water_centers]") );
[10:50:29] <jarr0dsz> the problem is that on location == intro the replacement code not working
[10:50:57] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: no it doent appear I knoe
[10:51:17] <jarr0dsz> lines 14-15 work but the 7-10 not
[10:55:18] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: first, console.log(data.location) to determine the value
[10:55:38] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: it redirects correctly, the problem is the replace code never gets executed
[10:56:03] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: your jquery looks fine to me, check your html
[10:56:05] <jarr0dsz> i already tried several things, after the redirect it just fails.. i have  a default spinner in the container div wich keeps displaying , so that replace code never executes correctly :(
[10:56:56] <jrockjiggz> #container_thegame ?
[10:57:04] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: no it is the matter of jquery when you disble a field then in $_POST you dont get the field at all like it does not exist in you form
[10:57:06] <jrockjiggz> that callback funciton will only run if the get is successful
[10:58:09] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: yes, this is the same as having a checkbox that isn't checked.. I guess if you still want the data, create a <input type="hidden" name="id_water_centers" value="xxx">
[10:58:10] <ericw> will JQuery recognize a wildcard? *
[10:58:25] <jrockjiggz> ericw: yes
[10:58:45] <imsky> ericw that's not a wildcard
[10:58:55] <ericw> what is a jquery wildcard?
[10:58:56] <ericw> lol
[10:59:05] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: that is none sense, there must be a way
[10:59:09] <imsky> ericw i dunno man, but * is http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#universal-selector
[10:59:44] <imsky> so if you have <ul><li><a><span>, it matches all those tags
[11:00:06] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: A disabled field is simply not submitted by browsers.
[11:00:09] <ericw> i'm looking to use it to specify a URL to apply an effect to every page /cloud/*/
[11:00:16] <ericw> so any folder AFTER cloud, not the cloud folder
[11:00:26] <imsky> yeah exactly ericw you're talking about very different things here
[11:00:33] <imsky> are you using some sort of framework like backbone or ember?
[11:00:45] <ericw> nah it's a very basic script
[11:00:57] <imsky> ok well jquery isn't involved here
[11:01:02] <imsky> you're just parsing the location, right?
[11:01:11] <ericw> i'll bbs i need to hop on a goto meeting
[11:01:35] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: i checked if the get works ok, if i enter the url directly it returns some html but in the firebug console it keeps loading forever ;s
[11:01:53] <jarr0dsz> what could cause that? the 2nd get lines work fine i just cannot get it work for intro
[11:02:04] <jarr0dsz> could it be the reload gets triggered after the get somehow, or messing the get up somehow?
[11:02:04] <ericw> actually jk my goto is in an hour
[11:02:06] <ericw> 12 not 11
[11:02:07] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: is it different domain?
[11:02:14] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: no same domain
[11:02:26] <jrockjiggz> then url is incorrect lol
[11:03:00] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: chrome or firefox?
[11:03:21] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: firefox, no the url is correct.. i shall double check it i copied the url in new browser tab loads up fine
[11:04:13] <jarr0dsz> perhaps if i first get the contents
[11:04:17] <jarr0dsz> then redirect and then replace
[11:04:24] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: you could be off a directory if you are loading it relative
[11:04:31] <motaka2> jrockjiggz: So is there a solution beacause I need  that field
[11:04:52] <ericw> if (window.location.href.indexOf('/.services/') != -1) {
[11:05:11] <ericw> imsky: if (window.location.href.indexOf('/.services/') != -1) {
[11:05:14] <jrockjiggz> motaka2: your choice is to save the data in a hidden field (that will send with POST), or, submit the form with ajax allowing you to append additional data (forcing that data to be included)
[11:05:45] <ericw> i have a lot of directories within /cloud/ that need the same function to take place
[11:06:50] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: i copyed the url straight from firebug and it works
[11:06:56] <jarr0dsz> tried to change the order but that messes things up also
[11:07:09] <ericw> but i don't want it to effect the /cloud/ directory. ;)
[11:07:15] <ericw> so i need to target everything AFTER /cloud/
[11:07:24] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: can i suggest you do:   console.log( '/game/' + data.game_id + "/in/" + data.location )
[11:07:32] <imsky> ericw yeah use a router, you're reinventing the wheel here
[11:07:37] <rgr> if I have a name of a jQuery.fn in a string var how do I call it for a selector such as $(".myclass") where explcitily I would $(".myclass").myfunc()
[11:08:06] <rgr> I thought something like el[funcstring] but thats not it
[11:08:13] <motaka2> ironfroggy: the hidden also behaves the same
[11:09:07] <jrockjiggz> rgr: you can try    window[functionNameAsStr](arguments);
[11:09:39] <rgr> yes but how to have it run as a selector function if you get my meaning.
[11:09:59] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: thx i missed your console message first your right it throws an /game/undefined/in/intro there
[11:10:11] <rgr> the func is defined as jQuery.fn.myFunc=function() {}
[11:10:12] <jrockjiggz> rgr: have your function return jquery object?
[11:10:17] <jarr0dsz> i must have oversee the game id in the url
[11:10:31] <rgr> and then var myf="myFunc"
[11:10:42] <ajpiano> rgr: $(".foo")[myf]()
[11:10:45] <jarr0dsz> i understand now, i pass a websocket command to a listener wich passes the data object with attributes.. this is lost on the redirect
[11:11:05] <jrockjiggz> rgr: if you are jQuery.fn.myFunc, -- then you should just be able to $(el).myFunc() .. ?
[11:11:27] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: what would you suggest storing the value of data.game_id  between a page reload? could i store it in jquery memory?
[11:11:40] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: no
[11:12:05] <rgr> jrockjiggz: no, as I said the func name is in a string variable (from some object meta data).
[11:12:07] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: you can use cookies, or pass the data through the url
[11:12:07] <jarr0dsz> i could make 2 websockets calls, 1 for redirecting 1 for the content replace but that seems a bit stupid
[11:12:17] <ajpiano> rgr: i just gave you the answer :p
[11:12:40] <rgr> ajpiano: thanks , missed it
[11:12:47] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano ahh cool solution :)
[11:13:02] <rgr> the solution.
[11:13:07] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: thx great i just diden't saw this.. i already pass the game.id inside the url
[11:13:13] <jarr0dsz> can jquery get a url param ? somehow
[11:13:26] <jarr0dsz> i could grabb it from the url like you suggested think that will be a wrap
[11:14:00] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: its not very straightforward, google will help
[11:15:17] <jarr0dsz> okay thanks figure it out
[11:16:17] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz, if you frames, it is possible to pass data between the windows
[11:17:04] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: you can actually communicate and run functions in other windows from other windows.. i'm not sure of your set up, but it sounds a little hectic ;)
[11:20:58] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: its actually quite structured, its part of rails project im using coffee script. i try now another approach made a listener with init wich redirects
[11:21:15] <jarr0dsz> then i just call the listen method again to replace the contents that should work. better than all the glueing jquery stuff
[11:22:50] <ajpiano> rgr: jrockjiggz it's an important example to recognise that constructs work the same in "unexpected" scenarios....
[11:23:14] <jarr0dsz> and that works ;) thx for the help guys
[11:23:25] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: yes, ty for the example its easy to miss sometimes
[11:23:35] <ajpiano> if [ foo ] does a dynamic property lookup, and () invokes a function, and the property of the object returns a function
[11:23:36] <ajpiano> then boom
[11:23:36] <ajpiano> yea
[11:23:48] <ajpiano> just something to keep in mind the next time you run into something similar
[11:24:03] <ajpiano> where you know how to do both x and y, but then just need to do a combination :)
[11:24:40] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: would you be able to explain the whole $(obj)[0] thing to me? i sometimes see .eq(0) but i know there is a difference
[11:25:08] <ajpiano> the first returns a native dom element, .eq returns a jquery object
[11:25:12] <ajpiano> wrapping said dom element
[11:25:33] <tw2113> what's the good word ajpiano
[11:25:55] <jrockjiggz> ok, but i believe you cannot run jquery functions on native dom elements
[11:26:03] <ajpiano> not much, trying to tweak my fantasy lineups before going out for the night and having company
[11:26:06] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: correct
[11:26:06] <jrockjiggz> but sometimes you can
[11:26:11] <ajpiano> no, you never can
[11:26:35] <jrockjiggz> ahhhhhh ok ;)
[11:26:47] <firstclassfuncti> what's the difference between defining JSON and defining an object literal? I'm mostly concerned about the use of " vs '
[11:26:56] <jrockjiggz> thats why $(this).submit() and $(this)[0].submit() works because both jquery and javascript both share this function name..
[11:27:11] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: yep, i was halfway through tpying that out
[11:27:29] <ajpiano> firstclassfuncti: http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
[11:27:40] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: thank you, :) here i was thinking it was the same function...
[11:27:56] <ajpiano> in JSON, all keys have to be in double quotes - in an object literal, they can be unquoted, single or double quotes
[11:29:11] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: so what is the difference between this and $(this)...
[11:29:21] <ajpiano> the same thing
[11:29:27] <ajpiano> assuming 'this' refers to a dom element
[11:29:29] <Ankabout> I can't seem to find a way to start on this... I'd like to set the width and height attributes in an img tag using jquery
[11:29:38] <jrockjiggz> ok
[11:30:03] <Ankabout> to the actual size of the image
[11:30:07] <jrockjiggz> Ankabout: use css?   $('img').css({ width: '400px', height: '400px' })
[11:30:38] <Ankabout> jrockjiggz, yeah, I need to override the css. some older IE browsers are having issues, and I need it in the img tag
[11:30:54] <firstclassfuncti> ajpiano: OK, I suppose I have to escape the double quotes inside of strings in JSON
[11:31:10] <ajpiano> firstclassfuncti: rare should be the case that you are manually handwriting json
[11:31:12] <jrockjiggz> Ankabout: $('img').attr('width',400).attr('height',400) ?
[11:31:38] <firstclassfuncti> ajpiano: yeah, thanks
[11:31:39] <Ankabout> ah yeah that should work. so all I need is to find the size of the image file
[11:32:39] <jrockjiggz> Ankabout: you can create an empty img dom element, load the image into it, get the image size, then drop it in
[11:32:54] <Ankabout> ah yeah that should work. thanks!
[11:32:59] <jrockjiggz> Ankabout: you can also use this to pre-load the image this way
[11:34:57] <jrockjiggz> var myImg = $('<img/>')[0].src = "image.jpg";  console.log( myImg.width() );
[11:38:17] <Ankabout> ah thanks. that should get be on the right path!
[11:38:20] <Ankabout> cheers jrockjiggz!
[11:38:30] <Ankabout> (dinner time, then back to work :)

[11:58:49] <jrockjiggz> or..   $('button').volume({ volumeBar: volumeBarValue++ })  //just guessing here
[11:59:11] <catphish> is there a standard method or library to upload an image by clicking on an existing image?
[11:59:35] <catphish> so you click on an img, get prompted for a file to upload, on successful upload, the image is reloaded
[12:00:22] <bigmeow> lol
[12:00:30] <bigmeow> anybody here who use maven?
[12:03:45] <jrockjiggz> bigmeow: #maven ?
[12:04:34] <catphish> this might help me :) https://github.com/valums/file-uploader
[12:05:04] <jrockjiggz> this is my personal fav: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[12:05:28] <catphish> i specifically want to upload a file when clicking an image
[12:05:38] <catphish> and have the image reload from the server when the upload is complete
[12:05:56] <catphish> i'll have a look at both, thanks
[12:07:10] <catphish> jrockjiggz: used the one you linked to for another project, it's awesome :)
[12:13:08] <rgr> if I have a selector so '$(".centercontainer .listevent")' how do I think refine it to say "and not has a class of 'ignoreclass'"?
[12:14:05] <jrockjiggz> $('span').not('.ignoreClass')
[12:14:43] <catphish> be sure to skim read http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:14:51] <rgr> also $(".thumbs:not(.selected)") ?
[12:14:57] <rgr> (google result)
[12:15:03] <rgr> one better than the other?
[12:15:16] <jrockjiggz> :not will use regex
[12:15:31] <jrockjiggz> i guess a little slower.. i dont really have any proof
[12:15:50] <jrockjiggz> classes are always slower than ID
[12:15:59] <catphish> surely .not has to select them then filter and unselect them
[12:16:11] <catphish> whereas :not is actually a filter
[12:16:24] <catphish> ie one pass
[12:17:18] <vamega1> Hey, is there a way be notified of the deepest element in the DOM which recieved a click?
[12:17:36] <jrockjiggz> vamega1: $(this) ?
[12:17:37] <jrockjiggz> lol
[12:18:15] <vamega1> JROCKJIZZ, that wouldn't fire for every element?
[12:18:22] <jrockjiggz> no
[12:18:26] <jrockjiggz> $('*').click() would
[12:18:29] <vamega1> Oh great thanks
[12:19:42] <vamega1> Wait, I'm not sure I understand this
[12:20:11] <vamega1> How do I attach the click handler to the element that was clicked?
[12:20:37] <jrockjiggz> you would attach a click handler before its clicked
[12:20:53] <jrockjiggz> so you bind something to that element to respond when clicked
[12:22:03] <jrockjiggz> if you want to bind  to every single element in your dom (not a good idea):  $('body *').click( function(){ $(this).css({ border: '1px solid red' }); });
[12:27:33] <vamega1> That doesn't seem to work
[12:28:05] <vamega1> http://jsfiddle.net/54p5g/
[12:29:12] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/54p5g/1/
[12:29:36] <vamega1> Clicking the bold Avengers text
[12:29:46] <vamega1> also gives the surrounding p a red border
[12:31:15] <jrockjiggz> yes, two click events are being fired
[12:31:39] <jrockjiggz> just change your criteria http://jsfiddle.net/54p5g/3/
[12:32:19] <bigmeow> what is the advantage of jquery when compared with extjs?
[12:33:27] <vamega1> Jrockjiggz - Then it no longer works when I click on a paragraph.
[12:35:33] <vamega1> I'm trying to grab the deepest element in the dom
[12:36:20] <bigmeow> lol
[12:45:49] <alexc> why does this return a huge amount of html, instead of just the array?
[12:45:55] <alexc> http://paste.laravel.com/5HB
[12:58:04] <DartmanX> if you guys were starting a brand new project on a public code repo, would you recommend github, code.google, or something else?
[12:58:11] <DartmanX> (project is relevant to jquery)
[12:58:21] <callumacrae> GitHub
[12:58:29] <callumacrae> jQuery itself uses GitHub
[12:58:40] <DartmanX> good point, and most of my stuff is there anyways
[12:58:40] <callumacrae> (that's not a reason, that's just proof)
[12:59:50] <DartmanX> I have some java builder classes for use with jquery-ui and jqgrid I was going to put online
[13:00:19] <Joeytje50> hey, is it possible to run something after 5 seperate $.get() requests have loaded?
[13:07:53] <wingy> how do you use responsive design in jquery mobile?
[13:07:58] <wingy> like the one in http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-beta.1/
[13:08:42] <Joeytje50> me?
[13:08:50] <wingy> anyone
[13:08:56] <Joeytje50> I mean
[13:08:59] <Joeytje50> is that a reply to me
[13:09:12] <wingy> who
[13:09:16] <Joeytje50> nvm
[13:24:21] <wingy> so dead here today
[13:24:24] <wingy> its saturday!
[13:36:25] <firstclassfuncti> wingy: I desperately need a simple templating solution
[13:36:42] <wingy> firstclassfuncti: ok?
[13:36:52] <firstclassfuncti> though I can't rely on the crappily thought out mustache and handlebars projects
[13:36:56] <firstclassfuncti> so think hard
[13:38:23] <wingy> firstclassfuncti: have you used jquery mobile?
[13:40:21] <firstclassfuncti> is that related to what I said? and no I haven't, I might in the future (or somehow accommodate our mobile users better)
[13:41:18] <wingy> no its not
[13:41:33] <wingy> just needed help myself
[13:43:24] <arielserafini> firstclassfuncti: underscore has a built in templating engine
[13:44:12] <wingy> what?
[13:44:27] <wingy> thought it was only a lower level utility lib
[13:44:36] <Spikes> arielserafini, isn't underscore itself a template lib?
[13:45:12] <arielserafini> Spikes: it's not a template lib, it's a general purpose utility lib, like wingy said
[13:45:22] <arielserafini> http://underscorejs.org/
[13:45:33] <arielserafini> and http://underscorejs.org/#template
[13:46:04] <Spikes> arielserafini, thanks, i guess i skipped that part when read docs
[13:46:53] <Spikes> Thought it was a template lib with some nifty methods to work with/in templates
[14:07:01] <raj> how can I do $('#place').html("<hello>") ?
[14:09:42] <raj> where the peepz at?
[14:11:09] <Spikes> raj, what's the question?
[14:11:18] <Spikes> how can you do what?
[14:12:34] <raj> how can I do $('#place').html("<hello>") ?
[14:12:41] <rmurphey> raj: what about it isn't working?
[14:12:59] <rmurphey> that is, what is haappening, and what do you expect to happen instead?
[14:13:04] <rmurphey> you aren't really giving us any information
[14:13:37] <raj> ok, if I do--> $('#place').html('<' + somevar + '>' + var2) --> it only puts var2
[14:13:51] <rmurphey> raj: that is because it treats <whatever> as an html tag
[14:13:57] <rmurphey> have you tried .text() instead?
[14:13:57] <raj> exactly
[14:14:00] <raj> so how do i escape it?
[14:14:07] <raj> that's the only way?
[14:15:37] <rmurphey> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/AQLrU/
[14:15:41] <rmurphey> just like you'd do it with ... html
[14:15:41] <raj> ok, if I do--> $('#place').html('<' + somevar + '>' + var2 + '</br>') --> it only puts var2
[14:16:11] <raj> aah, thanks
[14:19:06] <firstclassfuncti> whoever recommended the underscore template, thanks. works just fine
[14:25:57] <shoky> oi raj
[14:28:32] <Croves> Hello guys! (:
[14:29:19] <Croves> So... I'm trying to submit a form using $.ajax(), but I have a question about the 'data' argument
[14:29:43] <Croves> Is there any way to get all the form fields with jQuery without doing it manually?
[14:29:55] <shoky> Croves: $('#myform').serialize()
[14:30:03] <arielserafini> shoky: beat me to it
[14:30:05] <arielserafini> :/
[14:30:11] <shoky> ;p
[14:30:40] <Croves> Hey shoky, thank you! (:
[14:35:08] <raj> sup shoky ;)
[14:52:42] <Croves> Hey guys.. I'm trying to add a class to my div, but it's not working...
[14:52:47] <Croves> I'm doing this: $('#alert').attr('class') = json_response.CLASS;
[14:52:55] <Croves> I guess it's wrong :P
[14:54:49] <shoky> ?addClass
[14:54:50] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[14:55:12] <shoky> wadup raj
[14:55:27] <raj> chillin ni**a what up with you?
[14:56:12] <shoky> aduno
[14:56:15] <shoky> contemplating pizza.
[14:58:02] <Croves> LOL
[14:58:07] <Croves> thank you shoky :P
[14:58:35] <shoky> Croves: using attr like that with one argument is using it as just a getter
[14:58:48] <Croves> Oh, right...
[14:59:31] <chovy> anyone use stackmob?
[14:59:44] <chovy> looking for a free alternative for api
[14:59:57] <chovy> stackmob won't let you deploy unless you buy a package
[15:11:33] <wingy> chovy: look at UserGrid
[15:11:37] <wingy> the best
[15:11:49] <wingy> stackmob is stealing your money
[15:11:59] <wingy> the most expensive BAAS you can get
[15:12:07] <LordVorp> no, they are successfully SELLING what can alternatively be found for free. :)
[15:12:20] <LordVorp> not quite the same thing
[15:12:32] <LordVorp> some businesses don't appreciate something's value UNLESS they have been forced to pay for it
[15:12:45] <LordVorp> whereas we who use jQuery... get a lot for not much
[15:14:02] <Croves> Hey guys... check out my small app
[15:14:03] <Croves> http://apps.clovisfilho.com.br/encurtador/
[15:14:17] <Croves> I'm still having a litle problem with jQuery
[15:15:08] <Croves> If you add a invalid URL (like: www.google.coms), the alert box will became red... but if you add a valid url (without closing the box), it won't become green
[15:15:10] <Spikes> man, why does firefox has such a slow js engine
[15:16:02] <chovy> wingy: which one do i do? http://apigee.com/about/sign-up
[15:16:19] <wingy> app services
[15:16:57] <arielserafini> Croves: post a fiddle with your code
[15:17:05] <wingy> LordVorp: how can your backend be free?
[15:17:25] <wingy> you can't code what stackmob, apigee, kinvey et. al is giving you
[15:17:29] <wingy> for that you need devs
[15:17:32] <wingy> and devs cost
[15:17:45] <chovy> wingy: what does apigee do?
[15:17:45] <arielserafini> Croves: basically you have to call removeClass("alert-error") on success
[15:18:01] <wingy> chovy: everything for your API
[15:19:26] <Croves> arielserafini: Thank you.. I'll fix it
[15:20:28] <chovy> wingy: i don't actually have an api.
[15:20:34] <chovy> will this create one for me?
[15:20:50] <alexr2> I don't think you understand what an API is :-P
[15:20:53] <chovy> stackmob basically creates an api for you.
[15:21:39] <shoky> chovy.feed = "yumyum"
[15:21:44] <shoky> i basically created an api for you too
[15:23:07] <wingy> chovy: the basic API is already there if you are using their app services
[15:23:17] <wingy> so yes in a way
[15:23:26] <wingy> if you need custom API then you have to have a middle layer
[15:23:41] <wingy> but basically you will use their app services to manage objects/collections
[15:23:47] <wingy> they are your backend
[15:24:02] <chovy> i am just ui engineer...no api coding skills. Looking for a service that will provide this, stackmob looks good, but you have to use backbone.
[15:26:33] <wingy> trust me stackmob is not good :)
[15:26:36] <wingy> its robbing you
[15:26:59] <wingy> do yourself a favor and try apigee app services if you need a BAAS
[15:29:48] <chovy> stackmob is free
[15:29:53] <chovy> except they want a CC#
[15:30:18] <chovy> but it's not very flexible. requires backbone and code to be on a github repo
[15:32:21] <DartmanX> if anyone is interested, I just pushed out a Builder class for building jqGrid configurations. https://github.com/dartmanx/jqGridBuilder
[15:32:39] <DartmanX> I'll probably push out my jquery-UI dialog Builder tomorrow.
[15:34:37] <ML74> Could someone help me with $.ajax? When I POST, it doesn't seem to be posting the data and I can't retrieve it in the other script. I'm trying to post data that runs in the other script, then I can pull all the data from the other script inside a div in the original page. Anyone able to lend a hand?
[15:36:12] <alexr2> ML74, http://jsfiddle.net
[15:36:50] <ML74> alexr2: it's within a project or i would. can link you?
[15:37:09] <alexr2> Just put in the specific piece of code that is doing the ajax call
[15:37:13] <alexr2> Doesn't have to be all of it
[15:38:16] <ML74> http://jsfiddle.net/W8xxV/
[15:38:20] <ML74> that's the call
[15:39:05] <jrockjiggz> dataString should be data
[15:39:15] <alexr2> ^^
[15:39:29] <ML74> damn :( lol
[15:39:33] <ML74> spent 30 mins looking at that
[15:39:37] <ML74> cheers guys
[15:39:51] <jrockjiggz> you could actually data: {eid: eventid}
[16:21:31] <lahabana> hi all I'm working a widget that creates an image library and I've got a template provided by Handlebars
[16:21:41] <lahabana> that I use to generate the big images
[16:21:54] <lahabana> however I was wondering:
[16:21:58] <lahabana> When I change image should I better regenerate the whole template
[16:22:06] <lahabana> or modify each element one by one with jQuery?
[16:22:14] <lahabana> I mean in term of performances
[16:22:31] <alexr2> lahabana, depends how many things are changing
[16:22:53] <lahabana> alexr2: thx can I paste bin it to you
[16:23:05] <alexr2> If there's a single image with only a few fields changing, you aren't gonna have a huge difference between doing it from scratch or replacing an existing thing
[16:23:19] <alexr2> Feel free
[16:27:21] <lahabana> alexr2: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1824259
[16:27:39] <lahabana> alexr2: hmm there's quite a lot in my case
[16:27:54] <lahabana> and the idea is that the user can just personalise it
[16:28:39] <lahabana> which makes modifying it through jquery much harder that just regenerating the template
[16:28:45] <alexr2> lahabana, 6 lookups really isn't that much.  If you're replacing a single image, it really isn't going to be noticeable.
[16:28:53] <alexr2> If it's easier to fully replace it, feel free
[16:29:01] <alexr2> That's what I would do just for simplicity
[16:29:25] <lahabana> ok cause in my case
[16:29:44] <lahabana> everything will be regenerated (all the template I've given you)
[16:31:06] <lahabana> alexr2: no?
[16:31:21] <alexr2> ?
[16:31:47] <lahabana> you don't think that regenerating the template will make quite slow?
[16:31:53] <alexr2> no
[16:32:00] <lahabana> as there's quite a lot of things with style etc?
[16:32:10] <lahabana> ok cool then ;)
[16:32:16] <lahabana> thx a lot
[16:33:11] <alexr2> no problem
[16:44:24] <odigity> I can't seem to get .focus() to work.  the selector is working; I can call .val() on it, and it returns the value in the text box I'm targeting, but when I call .focus() instead, nothing happens.  I'm testing using the broswer javascript console
[16:44:49] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net
[16:47:32] <shoky> odigity: don't test focus() from the javascript console..
[16:47:43] <odigity> why not?
[16:47:54] <shoky> because the console steals the focus, as you'd usually want
[16:48:32] <odigity> well, it also doesn't work with the console off
[16:48:41] <odigity> which is why I started testing using the console  :)
[16:48:45] <shoky> then see alexr2's response
[16:48:59] <odigity> lemme try something
[16:50:19] <odigity> must have been a timing issue.  I moved the code to a different part of my app and now it's working
[16:51:40] <odigity> separate but related question -- what do I need to do to let the user hit enter after typing in the input box, and have it be the equivalent of clicking the button?  (obviously there's no form action, or it would work automatically)
[16:52:41] <alexr2> odigity, is it wrapped in a form tag at all?
[16:52:44] <shoky> handle the keyup event for example. with .keyup(...)
[16:53:20] <odigity> yes
[16:53:45] <alexr2> onsubmit should work then
[16:54:31] <alexr2> return false will prevent a page refresh
[16:54:35] <alexr2> or you could do it shoky's way
[16:54:39] <alexr2> that was my next suggestion
[16:55:18] <odigity> will try to use the code from this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/710359/210867
[16:56:29] <shoky> ya if there's a form then handling submit is better
[16:56:39] <shoky> *probably better
[16:58:56] <gt3> if i have an object that contains objects with callbacks named .run, how can i iterate over all of them and call their .run() callbacks at once? I'm figuring it's some type of map or $.each call, but not sure
[16:58:58] <odigity> well, that was silly.  I just tried it before adding the code, and it behaves that way automatically
[16:59:14] <odigity> I'm not sure how, though
[17:00:07] <alexr2> gt3, you can use a regular for loop and do your_object_array[index].run()
[17:00:58] <gt3> alexr2: my object doesnt have a numeric index though, it's all 'name':objvalue
[17:01:18] <shoky> gt3: what does your obj look like
[17:01:18] <alexc> is there a bootstrap channel?
[17:01:20] <gt3> or does javascript still do an implicit numerical index like php?
[17:01:42] <alexr2> alexc, yes there is #twitter-bootstrap
[17:01:53] <gt3> shoky, like i just hsowed: { 'foo': obj, 'bar': obj }  and the obj's have the .run callbacks
[17:02:01] <alexr2> gt3, for (var index in obj_array)
[17:02:07] <shoky> not for
[17:02:07] <alexr2> index will be the correct index for it
[17:02:09] <shoky> $.each
[17:02:19] <shoky> $.each(myObj, function(key,value) { ... })
[17:02:35] <alexr2> shoky, why?  why would you bulk on jquery's for loop when it's not necessary?
[17:02:57] <alexc> does anyone have a suggestion to this problem? https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3339
[17:03:07] <gt3> i'm sure i can do it with $.each, just wondering if there's a better way
[17:03:09] <alexc> my dropdown is being cut off by the modal popup
[17:03:18] <alexc> it's the last field on my form
[17:03:40] <gt3> since map is only for arrays
[17:03:48] <alexr2> gt3, for (var index in obj_array) { obj_array[index].run() }
[17:03:51] <alexr2> index will map correctly
[17:03:52] <shoky> alexr2: it's more readable, it gives you proper local scope for the loop body, it only iterates over properties that are really owned by the object
[17:04:10] <alexr2> he knows each object has the run function
[17:04:36] <gt3> alexr2: and that's an acceptable use of 'for..in' in js? I know it's bad in general to use it
[17:05:00] <alexr2> can't argue the whole scope deal, but i think it's excessive for what he needs it for
[17:06:05] <gt3> alexr2: you think which is excessive
[17:06:15] <alexr2> jquery's $.each
[17:06:30] <gt3> ah, yeah i don't think $.each reads better
[17:06:49] <gt3> but i'm used to for loops
[17:07:03] <shoky> $.each(myObj, function(k, obj) { obj.run() })
[17:07:08] <shoky> how does that not read better
[17:07:11] <jpic> hi all, is there a native data selector ? for example if $('#foo').data('bar', 'test'), then i'd like to find all elements with data 'bar' == 'test'
[17:07:25] <gt3> shoky, it creates k and doesn't use it
[17:07:27] <jpic> i can't find it in google, docs etc ..
[17:08:09] <shoky> gt3: it provides k, it doesnt "create" it.. so? you have 'index' in yours instead
[17:08:18] <gt3> shoky: also, you're creating a function just to call an existing function. too verbose
[17:08:56] <shoky> fair point..
[17:09:39] <gt3> but i only want to use for..in if that's an acceptable use since it's usually frowned upon. So i'm looking to make sure right now
[17:10:06] <alexr2> I've never known it to be frowned upon functionally.  It has a funky format
[17:10:12] <shoky> thing is
[17:10:32] <shoky> as soon as he'll wanna maybe change the inside of the loop, for example add someth async with a callback
[17:10:39] <shoky> he'll run into trouble
[17:10:53] <shoky> accessing obj_array[index] inside the callback
[17:11:10] <shoky> with $.each you just dont need to think about it

[17:11:40] <shoky> and if you're not using IE6 or something, then there's no real overhead to worry about
[17:11:59] <gt3> i might just use each afterall, just to be on the safe side
[17:13:22] <alexr2> jpic, not that I know of
[17:15:38] <alexr2> gt3, the article pretty much says that if you have a regular array (not associative), then for in loops are bad
[17:15:39] <shoky> jpic: "native" ?
[17:15:39] <alexr2> which is true
[17:15:45] <alexr2> it doesn't make sense to do that
[17:15:47] <shoky> jpic: you can use .filter
[17:16:36] <shoky> alexr2: it says that if you have any object whose prototype chain has some enumerable property, then you'll see that property in a for..in loop
[17:16:55] <shoky> unless you check with hasOwnProperty
[17:17:38] <jpic> ok, thanks
[17:18:56] <alexr2> correct, but wouldn't you need to do the same thing in the $.each loop?
[17:19:01] <shoky> no, $.each does that for you
[17:20:07] <alexr2> huh, didn't know that
[17:20:08] <Eviltwin> shoky: Actually...
[17:20:32] <shoky> yea i was just checking myself now :\
[17:21:00] <alexr2> i win?
[17:21:01] <alexr2> haha

[17:23:07] <ericw> is it possible to write a query to hide all of the text in a div/class starting at a comma?
[17:23:27] <alexr2> ericw, yes it is possible.
[17:23:34] <ericw> I have a line of text that is dynamic and states what categories an article exists in
[17:23:44] <ericw> i only want it to display 1 category but currently it displays all
[17:23:50] <ericw> it's cloud based so i can't modify it
[17:24:12] <rmurphey> ericw: the html is cloud based?
[17:24:15] <ericw> It reads "In: categoryX, categoryY
[17:24:20] <ericw> no, the HTML isn't cloud based
[17:24:33] <ericw> in the html it calls to <MTEntryCategory>
[17:24:50] <ericw> so I want to hide the comma so it only appears
[17:24:58] <ericw> In: CategoryX"
[17:25:12] <ericw> and hides the comma and any category after
[17:25:15] <alexr2> ericw, hide or completely remove is okay?
[17:25:22] <ericw> completely remove is ok also
[17:25:35] <rmurphey> ericw: you'd just use the .html() method to change the html of the element to what you want it to be
[17:25:38] <rmurphey> ?html @ ericw
[17:25:40] <bot-t> ericw, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[17:31:54] <alexr2> html + regex replace will get it done
[17:48:10] <abjorn> hows it goin #jquery
[18:28:00] <sunbeam> in this, jQuery("#post-status-info tbody td#wp-word-count") I want to add a new span.remaining - how can i best doj this?
[18:28:48] <alexr2> Your question is confusing
[18:29:02] <alexr2> you want to add it to the selector?
[18:29:17] <alexr2> or you want to put a span with class remaining into the content of that selector?
[18:34:27] <jrockjiggz> $('<span />').addClass('remaining').appendTo('#wp-word-count');
[18:34:48] <sunbeam> alexr2: yes
[18:35:10] <sunbeam> jrockjiggz: why just </span> ?
[18:35:24] <alexr2> sunbeam that's not what he wrote
[18:35:47] <sunbeam> I want to add
[18:35:49] <sunbeam> in that td
[18:35:56] <sunbeam> <span class="remaining"></span>
[18:37:05] <alexr2> What jrockjiggz wrote will do that
[18:41:11] <sunbeam> ok
[18:52:08] <sunbeam> anyone here common with tinymce?
[18:52:22] <sunbeam> What is the actual textarea i'm inputting text to with tinymce (in Wordpress)
[18:52:34] <sunbeam> I'm trying to apply NobleCount to it
[19:05:36] <carbon_> Hi, I have been beating jQuery around for a few hours trying to solve an overlap issue I am having with jQuery Carousel.
[19:07:01] <carbon_> I am trying to grasp how I can manipulate the z-index (css attribute) of each item in my jQuery applet
[19:07:34] <jimi_hendrix> i am trying to use jquery to make an ajax request. the data should be comes in a json but comes in with the MIME text/html (the data is json if i examine the text). jquery spits out a warning about the MIME not being JSON, so it gives me a warning and doesnt execute the success callback. how do i work around this?
[19:08:11] <jimi_hendrix> if i change the dataType from 'jsonp' to 'text/html', it then gives me errors about origins not being the same
[19:08:48] <alexr2> jimi_hendrix, is the request url on the same server?
[19:09:00] <carbon_> [Nevermind my question. I am using the wrong script.]
[19:09:18] <jimi_hendrix> alexr2, no, i am querying another site's REST api
[19:09:28] <alexr2> jimi_hendrix, try JSONP
[19:09:51] <alexr2> you can't do a regular JSON request to a different URL without a bunch of workarounds that won't necessarily work
[19:11:07] <jimi_hendrix> alexr2, i am using that as my dataType. then i dont get the success callback. just a warning about mime's not matching
[19:11:26] <alexr2> jimi_hendrix, JSON != JSONP
[19:12:40] <jimi_hendrix> alexr2, see my second message. i am using dataType: 'jsonp'
[19:12:50] <alexr2> ahh
[19:13:03] <alexr2> are you sure the site you're requesting from allows jsonp?
[19:13:40] <jimi_hendrix> i dont know. their API is not very well documented. http://tinysong.com/api
[19:14:19] <alexr2> show me code http://jsfiddle.net
[19:14:29] <alexr2> just the request you are doing
[19:15:50] <jimi_hendrix> http://jsfiddle.net/jZQeD/
[19:15:54] <jimi_hendrix> alexr2, ^
[19:19:27] <alexr2> their api is broken
[19:19:32] <alexr2> methinks
[19:20:10] <alexr2> it doesn't support jsonp
[19:20:57] <alexr2> which is silly
[19:21:59] <jimi_hendrix> so there is no way to get that data, alexr2?
[19:22:03] <shoky> no jsonp and no CORS header
[19:23:12] <rmurphey> jimi_hendrix: you'd need to use a server-side proxy
[19:23:40] <jimi_hendrix> ok
[19:23:42] <jimi_hendrix> thanks
[19:23:42] <rmurphey> so, you'd make a request to an endpoint on the same domain as your site
[19:23:50] <rmurphey> then that endpoint would access the api
[19:24:08] <alexr2> quick way to get your site blacklisted if it's popular though
[19:25:42] <alexr2> you might want to contact their developer and request that he add jsonp support
[19:27:26] <morficus> jsonp? gross
[19:27:39] <morficus> better yet, request for them to add CORS support
[19:27:50] <alexr2> *shrug*
[19:28:08] <morficus> jsonp was good for a bit, but it's still a hack :-p
[19:28:34] <morficus> CORS is the better way to share things across multiple domains
[19:28:48] <morficus> (cross origin resource sharing)
[19:29:43] <shoky> cors means you need to include xdr support for jquery if you want it to work on IE<10
[19:30:09] <morficus> 8 and 9 support cors
[19:30:17] <shoky> yes, with XDR
[19:30:21] <shoky> not with XHR
[19:30:32] <morficus> or you can use a post-message shim
[19:30:45] <morficus> I mean pollyfill
[19:31:17] <alexr2> http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9231316/Google_to_drop_support_for_IE8_on_Nov._15?taxonomyId=125
[19:31:26] <alexr2> Hopefully companies follow suit
[19:31:28] <alexr2> I know mine is
[19:31:33] <morficus> yeah
[19:31:39] <morficus> I'm in a mini-battle with mine to do the same
[19:31:56] <alexr2> We follow whatever google does... it's easy to explain to clients that way
[19:32:02] <shoky> "effectively ending support for many users of Windows XP"
[19:32:05] <shoky> what a load of crap
[19:32:07] <morficus> here is the pollyfill I was talking about: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/
[19:32:47] <morficus> hell, on one project they wanted us to support all the way down to IE6. just because "the client wants it"
[19:33:04] <morficus> was a 2 months endevour to convince them why we should not
[19:33:26] <morficus> the outcome is that our "minimum supported broswer" is now IE8
[19:33:32] <martisj> goood morning
[19:33:41] <alexr2> gotta cater to the weakest link i suppose
[19:33:45] <morficus> which is a huge win, considering IE6 and 7 were on the table before haha
[19:33:59] <morficus> no way, no catering to the weakest link
[19:34:07] <morficus> give them a path to upgrade and be stronger :-)
[19:34:25] <morficus> if they are in WinXP, they can upgrade to IE8 no problem
[19:34:27] <shoky> hmm how does that shim help with cors in IE?
[19:34:32] <morficus> and they can install Chrome
[19:34:58] <morficus> shoky: the shim checks for CORS support. if there is none, it uses postMessage() as a fall-back
[19:35:26] <morficus> hhm... actaully scrap that. I think it requieres changes on both the "requester" and "requesting" side
[19:35:30] <shoky> yeah..
[19:35:40] <morficus> it's been a while since I used it
[19:36:00] <morficus> granted a joined this conversation w/o any context :-p
[19:36:10] <morficus> first thing I saw was "add jsonp support"
[19:36:15] <alexr2> haha
[19:36:24] <shoky> ;p
[19:36:36] <alexr2> tinysong.com api doesn't support jsonp or CORS
[19:36:53] <alexr2> so no real way to get data from it frontend
[19:36:55] <morficus> how can you have a 3rd party API that doesn't support either?
[19:37:01] <morficus> ouch
[19:37:10] <alexr2> yeah... haha
[19:37:16] <morficus> back-end proxy it is I suppose
[19:37:34] <alexr2> [22:24:07] <alexr2> quick way to get your site blacklisted if it's popular though
[19:37:52] <alexr2> soon after you joined in
[19:38:40] <morficus> wait.. so they have an API that outputs JSON but doesn't support jsonp or cors? hhhm... seems a bit silly
[19:38:58] <alexr2> it's not even real json, it's html formatted json
[19:39:23] <alexr2> well.... actually that might just be a plugin i have running
[19:39:35] <alexr2> yeah that's just a plugin
[19:39:37] <alexr2> it does output json
[19:40:41] <morficus> I wonder why they decided on json output if they don't have support for front-end consumption
[19:40:43] <shoky> with html content-type though
[19:41:00] <kaushik_> hi
[19:41:02] <morficus> unless they plan on enabling it at some point
[19:41:08] <morficus> and just haven't gotten around to it
[19:41:12] <shoky> they prolly forgot the cors header or they disabled it for some reason
[19:41:16] <shoky> or that, yea
[19:41:51] <shoky> blacklist the world
[20:47:41] <njbair> I have a bug. When the browser window is <480px wide, jQuery won't select a particular div, even though that div is visible. What might be causing this?
[21:04:23] <jellostick> I want to run a function if the user clicks anywhere on the page *that's not an element*.  is this possible?
[21:04:46] <jellostick> I tried $(document).mousedown but that runs if they click anywhere, even on an element
[21:06:19] <tjz> Hello guys
[21:27:12] <piker32> ive got a larger-ish array to post using $.ajax : it seems like data is serializing things into the url, is there a way to append to the headers?
[21:35:18] <shoky> piker32: using type: 'post'  ?
[21:35:35] <piker32> yup
[21:35:59] <piker32> should it automatically throw <data> into the header?
[21:36:20] <shoky> <data> ?
[21:36:27] <shoky> what are you passing in as data?
[21:37:06] <piker32> a json array
[21:37:14] <piker32> should it go into the headers parameter?
[21:37:24] <piker32> (feels rhetorical but asking anyway)
[21:37:52] <shoky> not sure what you're asking
[21:38:24] <jrockjiggz_l> he's asking if it should throw <data> into the header
[21:38:46] <piker32> that was it
[21:38:54] <jrockjiggz_l> lol
[21:39:16] <piker32> thought it would pick where data would be stored too based on the request type
[21:39:18] <shoky> what do you want your serverside to see
[21:39:39] <piker32> makes sense that it would need both fields doing 2 different things
[21:40:42] <shoky> i'd use smth like..  $.ajax({ url: 'url', type: 'POST', data: { myarray: [1,2,3] } } )
[21:41:05] <piker32> its posting some long strings though
[21:41:31] <piker32> hence why id rather have in the header
[21:41:41] <shoky> what heaer
[21:41:42] <shoky> header
[21:41:51] <piker32> request header
[21:42:33] <shoky> you're doing $.ajax({ url: 'url', type: 'POST', data: { myarray: [1,2,3] } } )  ?
[21:42:39] <shoky> and it's putting it in the url?
[21:44:13] <piker32> from what i gather in fiddler - lemme double check
[21:48:24] <piker32> its in the TextView  but your right, the url isnt effected
[21:49:16] <piker32> but its not in the headers
[21:50:06] <shoky> shrugs
[21:50:07] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:50:37] <piker32> lol yea me too
[21:51:16] <piker32> first time deserializing a POST with an MVC controller so baby stepping haha
[21:56:48] <shoky> ?demo @ njbair
[21:56:59] <bot-t> njbair, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
