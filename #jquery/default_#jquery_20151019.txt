[00:29:48] <Rafa333> i think i have located my problem ...
[00:30:57] <Rafa333> but i have a question how can i trigger an event when a determined number of elements end thier ajax request ?
[00:31:41] <Rafa333> example when input a, b , c, d have finished to load data from ajax then trigger an event
[00:58:00] <javalover> is there some rule that states if I do $.post(); i'm not allowed to riderect?
[00:59:03] <A1234A> nope.
[00:59:39] <A1234A> but you have to wait for the post to finish then you can redirect.
[01:01:32] <javalover> i see what is happening here
[01:01:42] <javalover> somehow i think my alert statement was cancelling it
[01:02:52] <A1234A> what are you alerting?
[01:03:10] <javalover> i was alerting the recieved data
[01:03:22] <javalover> and then checking to see if $.trim(data == "success");
[01:03:29] <javalover> or
[01:03:31] <javalover> well that's bad typing
[01:03:40] <javalover> $.trim(data) == "success"
[01:04:03] <javalover> but I think because I had the alert(data); before my if statement..it was conflicting somehow.
[01:04:30] <javalover> because I removed that and now it works perfectly
[01:05:29] <A1234A> because alert only takes strings. if you try to alert some other thing it will rsult in error and cancel of exec at that point
[01:05:47] <javalover> oh
[01:06:34] <A1234A> anyway, you can log the data in console.
[01:06:38] <javalover> true
[01:06:50] <javalover> odd because alert(data) was giving me an output but I guess it was also ruining stuff...
[01:07:04] <javalover> it was just wierd because I also put an alert inside the if() and the 2nd alert went off anyways it works now :D
[01:08:09] <johndoe2> Hello :) I'm trying to get the next h1 tag in the DOM relative to the current viewport, however I have no idea how to do that. I know about .visible() but the element is not always in view. How do I go about doing that?
[01:09:38] <johndoe2> the main issue is that the user isn't clicking the h1 tag itself, otherwise it's very easy to use nextAll("h1")
[01:10:18] <A1234A> can you explain clearly? any jsfiddle?
[01:12:30] <johndoe2> I'll do the jsfiddle, but in the meantime let me give it a try: I have a long page with content and 3 h1 tags along the way. I would like to have a "next title" button, but I don't know how to find the next h1 which is below the current viewport (say viewport is now displaying content between the first h1 tag, and the second h1 tag, but neither h1 tags are actually visible so I can't use .visible() to select it).
[01:17:35] <A1234A> why can't you use inpage anchor tags
[01:18:16] <A1234A> for each h1 tags or buttons
[01:18:49] <A1234A> - will take to the specific ids
[01:19:43] <johndoe2> here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/qv848aj3/
[01:21:24] <johndoe2> even if I add IDs to each h1 tag, how do I find out which one is the closest to the viewport?
[05:40:37] <Twirl> hey guys, how can i detect if a click has been done on top of a specific div?
[05:40:49] <Twirl> and if not, do something?
[05:41:09] <Twirl> so bind a function to every click on the screen and if its on top of the div do nothing and if its outside do something
[05:47:32] <Cork> Twirl: sure bind a click handler on document
[05:48:03] <Cork> and check if $(event.target).closest('the element you want to exclude').length > 0
[05:48:09] <Cork> uh
[05:48:13] <Cork> * and check if $(event.target).closest('the element you want to exclude').length < 1
[05:48:40] <Twirl> gotta try it out
[05:50:04] <Kartagis> I have a.html, a.js and b.html. how is it possible to append to a div in b.html in a.js? http://termbin.com/hem7 is my js
[05:52:57] <FilipNortic> Kartagis: are you asking for a way to check which page you're on?
[05:53:42] <Kartagis> FilipNortic: no, I'm looking for a way to append to #contentHolder.profiles
[05:53:50] <Kartagis> it loades
[05:53:53] <Kartagis> loads
[05:54:14] <Cork> O_o
[05:54:30] <Cork> so you want to ajax load the b.html and append it to a.html?
[05:55:03] <Kartagis> Cork: no .profiles is in b.html
[05:55:16] <Cork> so yes
[05:55:44] <Cork> you would have to ajax load the b.html resource then select out the tags you want to extract from it
[05:55:48] <Cork> and then append them to the page
[05:56:10] <Cork> or create a partial server side that just contains that part (cleaner and less traffic)
[05:58:15] <Kartagis> Cork: I looked again, what you said is not what I want
[05:58:24] <Kartagis> let me use actual names
[05:58:25] <Cork> Kartagis: yes it is
[05:58:49] <Cork> Kartagis: you can't load parts of an html resource without loading the complete html resource
[05:59:12] <Cork> the only way to do that is to split that part into its own resource server side
[05:59:46] <Kartagis> I've got filters.html and I src filters.js. inside filters.js, I want to load profiles.html and result from filters.js to profiles.html
[06:00:20] <Cork> uh, what?
[06:00:40] <Cork> so you load filter.html it includes filter.js and it should render profiles.html??
[06:00:51] <Cork> that makes no sense
[06:00:56] <FilipNortic> so you want to execute all script on the loaded html before you add it to your page?
[06:01:18] <Kartagis> append profile to profiles.html*
[06:01:21] <Kartagis> Cork: ^
[06:01:33] <Cork> Kartagis: so you load profiles.html not filters.html?
[06:01:40] <Kartagis> aye
[06:02:05] <Cork> and filter.js should load filters.html and append them do profiles.html?
[06:02:55] <Kartagis> filters.js should load profiles.html and append to that
[06:03:00] <Cork> O_o
[06:03:07] <Cork> you load an html page, not a .js
[06:03:22] <Cork> so you load an html page it can load js that loads more html
[06:03:28] <Cork> you can't load a .js and get html from it
[06:07:00] <Kartagis> okay, then let me change this structure
[06:56:03] <Kamuela> Are there any cross-browser issues that jQuery does _not_ solve?
[06:56:16] <Cork> uh, sure
[06:57:05] <Kamuela> i'm using vanilla js for svg event listeners and I'm noticing that it works everywhere I've tested but mobile chrome
[07:35:54] <anli> Why do I not have a ckeditor on http://jsfiddle.net/Lnxh2553/2/ ?
[07:35:59] <anli> But only a textarea
[07:36:45] <anli> Hm, must think how, the contents is html encoded...
[07:37:04] <anli> ...of course it is...
[07:37:38] <momomo> Is there a way to fire an event when certain elements appended to the dom, using for instance append, when the content has been properly rendered? Right now, .height is returning incorrect value prematurely for some reason.
[07:37:40] <anli> Ah, name attribute was mandatory
[07:38:28] <momomo> if one waits, then height will return a different value a few seconds later
[07:48:30] <anli> What is wrong with the source of this? http://jsfiddle.net/Lnxh2553/5/
[07:48:37] <anli> ckeditor makes paragraph tags of it
[07:48:48] <anli> And makes almost everything vanish
[07:52:44] <anli> Ah, I need to use the setting allowedContent: true
[08:18:32] <thatIntern> Hey everyone :) Newbie question here:  I'm adding a class to a div which causes it to "blink" (by using fadeOut and fadeIn). However, I want to stop that "animation" instantly. How do I do that? using div.classList.remove  removes the class, but the effect still persists untill all the queued instances of the blink effect has run through. Is there a way to force a css style onto a div, and ignore whatever else was queued for it style-wise?
[08:44:06] <caraconan> Hi there. How can I get the received CSS selector in $(document).on('vclick', ('#bookmark', '#page-radio-detail-bookmark'), function () { ? Thanks
[08:44:33] <taplar> received css selector?
[08:46:40] <caraconan> Disregard, $(this).attr("id")
[08:51:19] <taplar> or just: this.id
[08:54:07] <caraconan> ok thanks
[09:44:53] <johndoe2> Morning :) I was wondering if someone could help me figure out how to find the next h1 tag below the current viewport? http://jsfiddle.net/qv848aj3/7/
[09:45:33] <Cork> johndoe2: you would have to loop them and check there position().top value
[09:46:38] <johndoe2> okay
[09:46:42] <johndoe2> thank you Cork
[09:47:39] <geoid> greetz
[09:49:17] <geoid> Anyone familiar with jQuery Validation Plugin here? I'm having some trouble. The submitHandler is not running but nor are any errors being shown. It's not clear how to debug this? I've checked that the form name is correct and the validate method is being triggered but after that it's not clear what's going on. There also doesn't seem to be a "onError" method that one can
[09:49:17] <geoid> over-ride to see whether validation is faiing but somehow just not being displayed.
[09:50:59] <johndoe2> one thing would be to get your hands dirty and shove some console.log() in the function that's supposed to be called
[09:53:23] <geoid> johndoe2 tried that without much success strangely. Maybe I'll give it another go :-/
[09:54:22] <johndoe2> if there's no success it means the particular function isn't triggered. I haven't played with that particular plugin though, so I'm not sure if it just listens for any submit or just the ones you specify in a "config" of sorts
[10:11:34] <acovrig> I need to do a POST request to an api server from a page loded as a file:// resource, and am getting Cross-Site issues (dataType: “json” runs an OPTIONS call and “jsonp” doesn’t support POST); what should I do?
[10:12:07] <Cork> acovrig: you would have to configure the server to allow cors
[10:12:30] <Cork> it has to respond to the browsers options request with an allow for the null origin
[10:12:44] <Cork> (null is what is used for the file:// origin)
[10:13:03] <Cork> if you don't have control of the server you would have to proxy the request
[10:13:50] <acovrig> Cork: OK, then I would use the “json” dataType, it would do the OPTIONS, server would respond, would the client auto do the POST or would the server read the OPTIONS as a POST?
[10:14:45] <johndoe2> speaking of proxying... I've yet to successfully achieve that. The browser still detects that the request is redirected to another domain name, even with x-forwarded-* headers removed.
[10:20:08] <whoknows> hey there
[10:20:16] <whoknows> wtf am i doing wrong? http://i.imgur.com/9UubeRV.png
[10:20:39] <johndoe2> whoknows try $(this)
[10:21:34] <whoknows> same
[10:21:43] <whoknows> btw, jquery 1.x
[10:22:17] <johndoe2> whoknows also your ("img") is not being called by jquery, because you didn't tell it to. $("img") would be it, but that would retrieve the first <img> it finds.
[10:22:55] <johndoe2> so the better question would be... where is that img tag? inside the anchor with the class .thumb ?
[10:23:22] <MikeD_> hi all, is there a way to reference the Deferred object via a reference to it's .promise() object?  Should I maintain a reference to the Deferred object or is that silly given that only the scope that created it knows anything about what it should be doing?
[10:23:51] <whoknows> i'm pointing to 1 to replace 2
[10:23:52] <taplar> MikeD_: what are you trying to do?
[10:23:54] <whoknows> http://i.imgur.com/6wGmCb9.png
[10:24:06] <shoky> MikeD_: the latter
[10:25:55] <whoknows> :(
[10:26:22] <MikeD_> shoky: thanks, i thought so - just wanted to confirm :)
[10:26:38] <shoky> whoknows:  $(this)  gives you the clicked element,  you can find stuff inside it with .find()
[10:29:15] <MikeD_> i was going to ask, but this looks like a good answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12077859/difference-between-this-and-event-target
[10:31:13] <whoknows> still nope :(
[10:32:16] <taplar> whoknows: make a fiddle
[10:33:09] <johndoe2> whoknows http://jsfiddle.net/rsbuob9b/ there it is.
[10:35:07] <whoknows> returns the same img
[10:35:30] <MikeD_> whoknows: what are you trying to do?
[10:35:59] <johndoe2> whoknows yes it does, it points at 1 and replaces 2, just like you said above
[10:37:01] <johndoe2> but on the bright side, you now have your very own fiddle that you can update and help us help you better :)
[10:37:12] <taplar> ^^^
[10:39:14] <geoid> greetz
[10:39:36] <geoid> what's the difference between $(function () { and jQuery(document).ready(function () { ?
[10:40:02] <taplar> geoid: they're functionally the same
[10:40:25] <whoknows> oh, but on the live site it for some reason doesnt
[10:40:34] <geoid> taplar tx
[10:40:35] <johndoe2> first needs to have jquery already handling the $, the second can run alongside anything else controlling $
[10:40:43] <Cork> geoid: none
[10:40:56] <Cork> geoid: the former is a shorthand for the later
[10:44:10] <Kamuela> Is there a way to get jQuery to select an svgDoc? the equivalent of: svg = document.getElementById('object-svg'); svgDoc = svg.contentDocument
[10:44:35] <johndoe2> whoknows try to update that fiddle with the html markup you have, and what you want to achieve. Unfortunately, I don't know what "it" stands for, nor do I know why "it" fails your expectations.
[10:45:33] <johndoe2> Kamuela if object-svg is the id, I think $("#object-svg") should work on the svg as well as any other tag
[10:46:27] <Kamuela> johndoe2: object-svg is the id, but it's <object id='object-svg'></object> So the actual svg gets loaded within the object tag
[10:48:01] <taplar> Kamuela: try svgDoc = $('#object-svg').prop('contentDocument');
[10:52:56] <Kamuela> will try that taplar
[11:22:48] <Kamuela> seem to have gotten it working as expected with jquery but mobile chrome still hates it
[11:23:49] <Kamuela> i just _know_ this guy is gonna be like hey guess what i can test it on mobile i got my android right here
[11:58:40] <jr3> can someone explain the .on selector parameter, I have a grid and I bind  $('.edit-btn').click() but any new rows added don't get handled correctly.
[11:58:52] <duch_kazatel> use the delegated syntax.
[11:59:02] <jr3> they dont get handled at all
[11:59:12] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[11:59:19] <duch_kazatel> just using .on() doesn't make it a delegated listener.
[11:59:33] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', '.edit-btn', function() {}); where 'parent' is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[12:00:02] <jr3> GOTCHA
[12:00:13] <jr3> oops, thanks duch_kazatel
[12:00:19] <duch_kazatel> out of curiosity, did you read the .on() docs?  what about them was confusing?
[12:00:32] <duch_kazatel> because it's very clear about that bit and I see that confusion happen constantly.
[12:02:31] <jr3> duch_kazatel: now that I slowed down and read the entire thing I see.
[12:02:41] <jr3> instant gratification ..
[12:11:50] <arup_r> Can I add values to the `data:` key inside the beforeSend hook, while doing Ajax ( http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)
[12:12:08] <duch_kazatel> sort of, but I'd avoid it tbh.
[12:18:05] <Joelesign> Hi everyone!
[12:18:33] <taplar> aloha
[12:19:12] <Joelesign> I'm fighting with a small filter system that you can see here: jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/
[12:19:55] <Joelesign> The problem here is that the "Check all" select even the checkboxes who are not currently showed
[12:20:13] <Joelesign> And they are going to be submited with the form
[12:20:16] <taplar> ah
[12:20:26] <Joelesign> And I don't want that to happen
[12:20:52] <taplar> filter on the visible ones
[12:20:58] <Joelesign> Anyone have a line of code to fix it please?
[12:21:04] <arup_r> not possible ?
[12:21:25] <taplar> Joelesign: http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/5/
[12:22:38] <Joelesign> taplar: Let me check
[12:22:44] <duch_kazatel> arup_r.... i answered you.
[12:22:47] <Joelesign> thanks man
[12:22:50] <duch_kazatel> it's possible, but i'd avoid it.
[12:23:05] <arup_r> ok. I thought someone else.
[12:26:52] <Joelesign> taplar: Sorry but you made your change on an old version
[12:26:58] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:27:03] <duch_kazatel> Joelesign try to apply the change yourself then :)
[12:27:17] <taplar> ^
[12:28:36] <shoky> Joelesign didn't we go through this yesterday ;p
[12:29:28] <shoky> this was the latest version i think  http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/4/
[12:29:32] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: Can you show me how ?
[12:29:42] <arup_r> I need to do it
[12:29:52] <duch_kazatel> arup_r uh, why not just build the object beforehand, instead of editing in beforesend?
[12:31:46] <arup_r> there is a reason.
[12:31:53] <shoky> you don't need to do it. there is no reason.
[12:31:58] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:32:20] <arup_r> I am on Rails and using link_to remote: true. Which is why I need something..
[12:32:28] <duch_kazatel> how are you building the object?
[12:32:38] <arup_r> shoky: There is at least in my usecase
[12:32:50] <arup_r> check this Gist https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/be12f915ce8f387ad3e7#file-_distribution_list_-html-haml-L13
[12:32:55] <duch_kazatel> arup_r nothing about that requires you to use beforeSend
[12:33:06] <duch_kazatel> showp your code.
[12:33:12] <shoky> well, crap workarounds for crap setups could use stuff like beforeSend, sure :)
[12:33:15] <arup_r> I already \did
[12:34:04] <duch_kazatel> arup_r that's coffeescript and haml - try js and the rendered html instead ;)
[12:34:47] <Joelesign> shoky: Here you are? ^^
[12:35:00] <Joelesign> Don't worry, I got it. It's working now. ;)
[12:35:01] <shoky> here me is
[12:35:13] <shoky> groovy
[12:35:32] <arup_r> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:37:07] <taplar> works my fiddle does
[12:37:14] <duch_kazatel> arup_r noramlly, you'd just construct an object and pass that to the $.ajax() call.
[12:37:20] <duch_kazatel> no idea why you think you need beforeSend.
[12:37:36] <Joelesign> shoky: Look like there is something missing O_O
[12:37:58] <arup_r> i know.. But on Rails with link_to remote: true, no option I see to add the object to the data: key
[12:38:02] <Joelesign> When I uncheck the "Check all" the xheckboxes are still disable
[12:38:06] <shoky> Joelesign: like i was saying last night.. you are not re-enabling any checkboxes
[12:38:07] <Joelesign> It's anoying
[12:38:14] <duch_kazatel> arup_r wat
[12:38:23] <duch_kazatel> arup_r that has nothing to do with anything here.
[12:38:27] <shoky> Joelesign: because you're still doing that big error we were talking about,  running stuff on labels instead of checkboxes
[12:38:36] <arup_r> yes, that is not for Jquery
[12:38:42] <arup_r> but the idea helps
[12:38:48] <duch_kazatel> *jQuery, and not really - i don't know RoR.
[12:38:53] <arup_r> because I will write Jquery
[12:38:58] <duch_kazatel> and your backend is entirely irrelevant.
[12:38:59] <arup_r> no need to know ROR.
[12:39:03] <arup_r> :)
[12:39:09] <arup_r> Wanted to know the hack
[12:39:14] <duch_kazatel> don't use the hack.
[12:39:15] <Joelesign> shoky: Yeah I see
[12:39:17] <arup_r> hehe., if I can use beforeSend
[12:39:20] <duch_kazatel> construct the object correctly ahead of time.
[12:39:24] <duch_kazatel> beforeSend is gross.
[12:39:28] <arup_r> ok
[12:42:23] <shoky> Joelesign:  i just renamed the variables to be more clear, maybe it'll help you see what you need to change  http://jsfiddle.net/goLwpnxz/6/
[12:45:11] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: so, say you have a list of checkboxes. Now you select as much as you want. Then you click on a link/button which will submit the selected checkboxes value to the server using Ajax. How you will go to solve this? I have exactly the same usecase
[12:45:48] <arup_r> seeking for an idea. Because my idea has proven as dirty as possible :(
[12:45:48] <duch_kazatel> build up the data object in the event handler and hand it to $.ajax()
[12:46:06] <duch_kazatel> could even .map().get() it for maximum funk.
[12:46:19] <taplar> or serialize
[12:46:21] <arup_r> hum. That is possible. In Rails it seems a bit hard
[12:46:33] <duch_kazatel> arup_r is your problem with your frontend or backend?
[12:46:46] <arup_r> anyway, let me see if I find something there. otherwise I will use vanilla JS
[12:46:46] <duch_kazatel> because you keep talking about rails - JS doesn't care about your backend.
[12:46:50] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:47:00] <duch_kazatel> share your rendered markup in a fiddle i guess.
[12:47:05] <arup_r> ok
[12:47:11] <duch_kazatel> because you're overcomplicating something bigtime.
[12:47:23] <shoky> rails iirc hijacks your links and does ajax crap for you in the background
[12:47:25] <duch_kazatel> taplar serialize would work, too, assuming they're in a form.
[12:47:27] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: I know both .. :) so prepare data, so that my backend understand
[12:47:30] <arup_r> giving you
[12:47:34] <arup_r> min please
[12:47:56] <duch_kazatel> arup_r i don't really know RoR, and that has nothing to do with JS.
[12:48:32] <arup_r> Yes, Rails has some hooks to work with JS. but what I want is beyond that helpers.. it seems
[12:48:54] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what rails provides you.  but the client side part of this is pretty trivial ;)
[12:48:58] <arup_r> checking here https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/blob/c7f15691980bdbf032fbfd15842e39a7873bc65e/src/rails.js .. But I know how easy it is to do with $.ajax()
[12:49:04] <arup_r> just trying that way
[12:49:06] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[12:49:14] <duch_kazatel> i give up
[12:49:24] <arup_r> ok.. I will also in few mins
[12:49:25] <arup_r> :D
[12:49:35] <arup_r> anyway thanks friends
[12:49:52] <shoky> arup_r there is probably a better way to do what you want
[12:50:07] <shoky> but you'll need to dig through rails docs/forums/dono
[12:50:16] <arup_r> ys,, digging
[12:50:19] <duch_kazatel> the proper response to "hey share your markup and we can help you out" is not sending us some unrelated plugin.
[12:50:35] <duch_kazatel> need to split out the basics in your head.
[12:50:44] <shoky> his problem i assume has to do with rails hijacking all his links/buttons, and calling $.ajax for him behind the scenes
[12:50:56] <shoky> he'd like to modify this request
[12:51:10] <duch_kazatel> if that's the issue, then there should be an option to cancel those.
[12:51:12] <shoky> hence he was looking at beforeSend
[12:51:31] <shoky> yah or there's probably an option to add your own data that will do this for him, or something
[12:51:42] <duch_kazatel> right.  learn to use the toolset.
[12:51:53] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a question for #rails at that point.
[12:51:59] <shoky> yop
[13:14:47] <mozzarella> I need help
[13:14:58] <taplar> ask away
[13:15:00] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[13:15:57] <mozzarella> sometimes I try to alert() some stuff but it doesn't do anything, why is that
[13:16:04] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[13:16:25] <duch_kazatel> 1: why are you using alert()? 2: you may have ticked that box that says "don't show any more for this domain" or w/e
[13:16:37] * johndoe2 mozzarella  that's nothing serious by the way, don't listen to your wife, no counseling needed :P
[13:16:41] <mozzarella> I'm trying to debug my script
[13:16:42] <_Garry_> Hi *
[13:16:49] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella use console.log() instead.
[13:17:02] <mozzarella> how is it better?
[13:17:21] <duch_kazatel> alert() locks the page up and can make things unpredictable.
[13:17:41] <duch_kazatel> if you want to step through your code, use the debugger built in to your browser.
[13:18:44] <mozzarella> web console or browser console (in firefox)?
[13:18:59] <duch_kazatel> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:19:04] <duch_kazatel> if you're on windows, hit the f12 key
[13:19:16] <duch_kazatel> there's a "console" tab in the tools that pop up.
[13:25:53] <rindolf> Hi all.
[13:26:35] <duch_kazatel> hello
[13:27:06] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: hi, sup?
[13:27:36] <duch_kazatel> just responding to you >.>
[13:27:43] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: ah.
[13:30:14] <mozzarella> how do I get the firt item for a collection of items?
[13:30:32] <mozzarella> $("p")[0]?
[13:30:32] <duch_kazatel> a few ways.
[13:30:36] <duch_kazatel> .eq(0)
[13:30:40] <duch_kazatel> or .first()
[13:30:53] <_Garry_> I probably have a wrong idea about requirements of this, but how can a sequentially fade some text in and back out, modify it, then continue ... somehow, it just goes through the whole list without waiting in between, even though I have delay() calls as well as a "complete" function call on the fadeout? see: http://hunt.gc-fd.de/test.html ... it just runs through all of my code before actually doing anything
[13:30:55] <duch_kazatel> using [0] gets you the DOM node, which usually isn't what you want.
[13:31:15] <duch_kazatel> _Garry_ try making a fiddle instead.
[13:31:40] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: "$(…).first is not a function"
[13:31:54] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella wat
[13:32:08] <duch_kazatel> that's been around forever.
[13:32:35] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: http://i.imgur.com/uo3Lpr4.png
[13:32:57] <duch_kazatel> $.fn.jquery
[13:32:59] <duch_kazatel> what does that give you:?
[13:33:07] <duch_kazatel> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s3hmsptn/
[13:33:44] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: undefined
[13:33:58] <duch_kazatel> that's why
[13:34:05] <mozzarella> is it better to use " or '?
[13:34:52] <duch_kazatel> either/or.  i prefer singles.
[13:35:06] <mozzarella> how do I fix it now
[13:35:09] <duch_kazatel> and you don't have jquery loaded or you're in noconflict mode.
[13:35:17] <duch_kazatel> try jQuery.fn.jquery
[13:35:23] <duch_kazatel> what does that give you?
[13:36:06] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: 1.6.2
[13:36:18] <duch_kazatel> then you're in noconflict mode.
[13:36:27] <mozzarella> what's that
[13:36:30] <mozzarella> is that old btw?
[13:36:35] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[13:36:43] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[13:38:44] <mozzarella> so, $ is not jquery?
[13:38:47] <mozzarella> in my case?
[13:38:50] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[13:39:02] <duch_kazatel> you could use an IIFE to "alias" it if you wanted.
[13:40:18] <duch_kazatel> https://bpaste.net/show/a97927147664 basically, anywhere inside that function can use $ instead of the full name.
[13:44:23] <_Garry_> http://jsfiddle.net/5erzf4f0/ - I want the texts to be animated one at a time, instead of what it does now ...
[13:44:49] <_Garry_> Probably missing something essential about the way jquery handles the animation
[13:45:43] <duch_kazatel> first off.
[13:45:50] <duch_kazatel> see your console?
[13:46:43] <duch_kazatel> also: <body onload="dotext()"> - no
[13:46:49] <plamb> is there a .on('hover' ...
[13:46:59] <duch_kazatel> plamb mouseenter and mouseleave.
[13:47:04] <duch_kazatel> _Garry_ you want a document ready.
[13:47:30] <_Garry_> I've been through several version, one was $(document).ready ...
[13:47:41] <duch_kazatel> _Garry_ you don't want to put function calls in your html.
[13:48:08] <_Garry_> then, it would already run through the code without even displaying it ;)
[13:48:16] <duch_kazatel> ij
[13:48:20] <duch_kazatel> *uh
[13:48:25] <duch_kazatel> you're confused ;)
[13:48:30] <_Garry_> probably ;)
[13:48:50] <duch_kazatel> but start by looking at your console and fixing each thing you find.
[13:50:52] <_Garry_> My console output is empty ... no errors reported ... (well, after cleaning up a couple things in the fiddle, the original code was also "clean" as far as errors go ...)
[13:51:01] <duch_kazatel> the fiddle had errors.
[13:51:04] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have now.
[13:51:36] <_Garry_> Not anymore
[13:51:40] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[13:51:49] <_Garry_> http://jsfiddle.net/5erzf4f0/2/
[13:52:16] <duch_kazatel> where's the new div come from?
[13:52:51] <_Garry_> Problem seems to be that JQ pushes all the animations in parallel, even though I have the "completed" call in the fadeout call ...
[13:53:01] <duch_kazatel> right, because you're using a for look.
[13:53:07] <mozzarella> how can I add something next to a node?
[13:53:08] <duch_kazatel> and making all the calls basically immediately.
[13:53:18] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella define "next to"
[13:54:14] <_Garry_> Found an example that consists of many temporary functions daisy-chained over all the calls ... guess I'll try replicating that ...
[13:54:17] <duch_kazatel> _Garry_ you could read up on animation queues.
[13:54:34] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you could experiment with recursive function calls.
[13:54:40] <mozzarella> <h1></h1><h3></h3>, I want to select h1 and create h2 next to it
[13:54:48] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella insertAfter()
[13:55:52] <_Garry_> I tried the recursive part, but by calling the next level after just queueing instead of executing the fade, I ended up with what I have now ;)
[13:56:22] <gremlyn> is there anything 'out of the box' in jQuery that would let me monitor a group of elements for change(s) and then iterate over just the subset of that did change?
[13:56:34] <gremlyn> can't find anything, but I figured I would check before making it myself
[13:56:40] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn i wouldn't do that at all.
[13:56:48] <duch_kazatel> that's a hack and prone to very confusing code.
[13:56:52] <gremlyn> ?
[13:57:02] <gremlyn> how so?
[13:57:04] <duch_kazatel> monitoring the DOM for changes?
[13:57:13] <gremlyn> form inputs
[13:57:13] <duch_kazatel> update the code making the changes instead.
[13:57:25] <duch_kazatel> are you talking about the input or change event?
[13:57:49] <jfive> or even just .on('mouseout') on the input
[13:58:07] <jfive> similar to .change() i suppose
[13:58:09] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use mouseout if you care about the inputs changing.
[13:58:16] <duch_kazatel> not similar at all :)
[13:58:23] <gremlyn> mouse events won't work
[13:58:35] <duch_kazatel> you want .on('change', function() {});
[13:58:38] <duch_kazatel> or input, either/or
[13:58:46] <gremlyn> so I have some code that uses .change() to detected when a tyle=url input is changed
[13:59:29] <gremlyn> when it does, it verified that the URL is valid, and then if so, goes off and uses ajax to grab pictures from the URL, very much like what FB does when you input a link to post
[13:59:49] <duch_kazatel> ajax to your box?
[13:59:58] <gremlyn> box?
[14:00:02] <duch_kazatel> server
[14:00:08] <gremlyn> ah yeah
[14:00:32] <gremlyn> script on my server does the heavy lifting, ajax just waits for the json to come back with the relevant strings
[14:00:48] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you want the input event and maybe throttle it?
[14:00:53] <duch_kazatel> or debounce it.
[14:01:19] <plamb> any idea why the .show() on the span on the first element is showing behind the other elements
[14:01:21] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/g5byxqn1/
[14:01:29] <plamb> it has a higher z-index
[14:01:36] <gremlyn> so yeah, what I need to do now is apply this to 1...n inputs, and I have a bulk-import method so I could need to grab 10 urls at one time, but I want to iterate over all the inputs that need to be updated rather than all
[14:01:43] <mozzarella> if I have a jquery object, how can I select something in it?
[14:01:51] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella make a fiddle.
[14:02:06] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn make a fiddle :)
[14:02:15] <plamb> plamb m-made a f-fiddle
[14:02:18] <gremlyn> hah that would be a complex fiddle :)
[14:02:31] <gremlyn> it sounds like there isn't anything off the shelf to accomplish what I want
[14:02:33] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn not really - don' need the ajax.  you're just working with event handlers.
[14:02:37] <gremlyn> which is all I really need to know
[14:02:40] <duch_kazatel> what you want sounds convoluted.
[14:02:45] <gremlyn> story of my life
[14:02:46] <duch_kazatel> plamb the base element is still z-index 1
[14:02:57] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn the approach sounds... really unusual.
[14:02:59] <plamb> and the span inherits that or something?
[14:03:06] <duch_kazatel> plamb basically.  new "context"
[14:03:16] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, what part of the approach?
[14:03:16] <plamb> can you force it to z-index 2 somehow?
[14:03:25] <gremlyn> the going off and grabbing the images part is pretty basic
[14:03:25] <mozzarella> $('tr').each(function(entry) { entry.('td').first().after("<td>another td</td>"); });
[14:03:27] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: ^
[14:03:32] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn how would the user modify multiple inputs at the same time.
[14:03:38] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella that's... not a fiddle.
[14:03:41] <gremlyn> through the bulk-import method
[14:03:59] <mozzarella> just put it in fiddle
[14:04:11] <duch_kazatel> plamb yep.
[14:04:15] <plamb> h-how
[14:04:19] <plamb> add it via jquery?
[14:04:24] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:04:57] <gremlyn> they can copy/paste urls into it (with some other data that gets parsed along with it), and then click the button, which parses the data into the relevant inputs, so when they do that I need to see what changed and then update the images accordingly
[14:05:06] <gremlyn> but not all at once because that would be mayhem :)
[14:05:17] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn you can get all populated inputs.
[14:05:21] <duch_kazatel> by checking the .val()
[14:05:39] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, yeah, but if they modify a couple of URLs I figure I don't want to redo all of them
[14:06:32] <plamb> hmm its still showing up behind it duch_kazatel
[14:06:33] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/g5byxqn1/1/
[14:06:39] <duch_kazatel> then bind a listener to the input/change event and modify a data attribute, gremlyn
[14:06:39] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:07:52] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, data attribute is a good call, store the input val as a data attr and then check it against when it might be modified
[14:07:54] <gremlyn> thanks duch_kazatel
[14:09:49] <duch_kazatel> err.
[14:09:49] <_Garry_> minimal change on the fadeout() call fixed it ... instead of putting the recursive call as the completed-function, I added a sub-function that does the call ... now the animation correctly waits for the completion before calling the next iteration ...
[14:09:51] <_Garry_> tnx
[14:09:59] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn then use the .val() for that.
[14:09:59] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:10:08] <duch_kazatel> either way, woo.
[14:10:17] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, I need something to compare the updated .val to though
[14:10:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd just use the data attribute to say if it was modified.
[14:10:37] <duch_kazatel> not store full values.
[14:10:45] <gremlyn> but what if it is modified twice?
[14:10:53] <gremlyn> 4 times?
[14:10:56] <duch_kazatel> then it was modified twice before the user submitted.
[14:11:04] <duch_kazatel> you don't care how many times, just that it happened.
[14:11:19] <duch_kazatel> user clicks submit, go through and "reset" all of those modified fields./
[14:12:24] <gremlyn> the form doesn't necessarily submit between modifications
[14:12:29] <duch_kazatel> right.
[14:12:55] <gremlyn> use could bulk import and then remember of I want to change this one url, then change it, then realise oh these two are wrong, and then change those, and then go back rechange the first
[14:12:59] <gremlyn> I have to account for that
[14:13:04] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:13:11] <gremlyn> told you it's complex
[14:13:14] <gremlyn> :)
[14:13:15] <duch_kazatel> you'
[14:13:19] <duch_kazatel> *you're convoluting it.
[14:13:24] <gremlyn> I wish I was
[14:13:26] <duch_kazatel> i promise.
[14:13:27] <duch_kazatel> you are :)
[14:17:43] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/23eujdwa/
[14:17:49] <plamb> that feel when it works in the fiddle and not in your code
[14:21:15] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: how do I do that: $('tr').first().('td').first()
[14:21:34] <mozzarella> I want the first td inside the first tr
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> $('tr td').first()
[14:21:51] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you want .find()
[14:24:22] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, unfortunately that is a way simplified version of what I'm actaully doing, and I don't ahve time to get it all into a fiddle right now
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:24:31] <gremlyn> I do appreciate your help tough
[14:24:59] <duch_kazatel> i really feel like you're overcomplicating something here, but whatens.
[14:25:02] <duch_kazatel> *whatevs

[14:26:43] <Calinou> it's <= 4 lines
[14:26:48] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter.
[14:26:58] <Calinou> feel free to paste nazi, but 4 lines doesn't trigger queuing in most IRC clients
[14:27:21] <duch_kazatel> err, we ask that people don't post code into the channel unless it's some small one liner.
[14:27:32] <duch_kazatel> hard to read otherwise.
[14:29:12] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: what does each() pass to the function? DOM object or jquery object?
[14:29:30] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Element
[14:30:37] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: I can't call find() on an Element?
[14:30:51] <duch_kazatel> not on a raw dom node, no.
[14:31:43] <mozzarella> damn
[14:31:55] <duch_kazatel> $(element)
[14:31:56] <duch_kazatel> or $(this)
[14:34:35] <mozzarella> after() doesn't do anything
[14:34:37] <mozzarella> (  ;____;)
[14:34:40] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle duder.
[14:34:52] <duch_kazatel> there's also an insertAfter()
[14:34:54] <duch_kazatel> pretty easy stuff.
[14:35:30] <mozzarella> I don't know how to debug that, there's just nothing that happens

[14:35:41] <duch_kazatel> okay, one sec.
[14:35:41] <mozzarella> no error in the console

[14:41:38] <duch_kazatel> arup_r huh?
[14:41:57] <duch_kazatel> oh, if you're about to show me any coffeescript/ruby, i'll be lost ;)
[14:43:02] <arup_r> haha.. please bear with me. :/ https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/be12f915ce8f387ad3e7
[14:43:09] <arup_r> Rails helped me to do this
[14:43:11] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:43:15] <duch_kazatel> congrats!
[14:43:18] <arup_r> I digged the source code and found it out
[14:43:24] <duch_kazatel> well done.
[14:43:32] <arup_r> thanks.. for your support too
[14:48:09] <geoid> What benefit is there to using coffee script? Just seems like a way to unlearn javascript to me.
[14:48:22] <duch_kazatel> some people think it's easier to read/write.
[14:48:40] <duch_kazatel> it added some syntactic sugar to make it easier to do some things.
[14:48:40] <geoid> Is it like jade is to html? If so I can imagine it's much easier to maintain. Jade is certainly less work than HTML. Nearly half.
[14:48:54] <duch_kazatel> not a templating language at all.
[14:49:18] <duch_kazatel> just an extra layer of stuff.  i really don't like jade personally, and i don't like coffeescript, but for different reason.
[14:49:22] <duch_kazatel> *reasons
[14:49:33] <geoid> No, I get that but I mean that if it makes javascript easier to maintain that I can see it being worthwhile.
[14:49:43] <duch_kazatel> i don't think it does at all.
[14:49:44] <duch_kazatel> some people do.
[14:49:55] <duch_kazatel> it's really popular with the ruby crowd.
[14:50:03] <geoid> Incidentally, why don't you like jade?
[14:50:18] <duch_kazatel> i don't like things that obscure away markup.
[14:50:24] <duch_kazatel> markup's never been the issue imo.
[14:50:43] <duch_kazatel> i think all you really need is a half decent templating engine.
[14:51:20] <geoid> ok. I didn't know anything about jade till recently but I've been using it with angularJs and I have definitely found that it saves me time when generating or editing markup.
[14:51:43] <duch_kazatel> eh, give me a half decent editor and dust or underscore templates and i'm fine.
[14:53:30] <mozzarella> what's a quick way to test selectors?
[14:53:40] <duch_kazatel> see if they returned something?
[14:53:41] <duch_kazatel> .length
[14:53:52] <mozzarella> I'm tired of editing code, using console.log, etc.
[14:54:06] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:54:18] <taplar> you can test them in your browser console if you just want to test the syntax not the timing
[14:54:23] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:54:47] <mozzarella> taplar: how?
[14:54:56] <duch_kazatel> by opening your console.
[14:55:44] <duch_kazatel> if jquery isn't loaded globally, you can usually just use document.querySelectorAll() instead if you just want to test the selectors.
[14:55:51] <duch_kazatel> not 100% equivalent, but close.
[15:00:35] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: tahnks, it's much quicker now
[15:08:15] <johndoe2> quick question: does mobile safari have a cap on how many times per second .click() can be triggered on a tag? I keep tapping the same button about every second or so and sometimes it goes 7-8 taps without triggering the function. Is it a bug? should I use something other than a .click() ?
[15:10:39] <johndoe2> maybe it has something to do with the double-tap behavior of the browser where it zooms in to that particular container?
[15:16:55] <johndoe2> right, so I'm now using .on('click touchend') but it triggers the button twice on a mobile device. is there a good way to do this?
[15:19:31] <mozzarella> duch_kazatel: I have html code in a string, how can I parse it and manipulate it with jquery?
[15:20:01] <taplar> mozzarella: you can stick it in $()
[15:23:46] <claytonzaugg> I have code that adjusts the height and width of a div based on the size of the browser window.  The problem is, I hide this div if the screen gets too small, but when I increase the width again, the div appears, but the things inside it are messed up because it based their h and w on the nothing when it was hidden.  If that makes sense to you, how can I resolve this?
[15:24:29] <claytonzaugg> I want the things inside the div to line up based on the height and width of the div when I unhide it
[15:28:03] <johndoe2> claytonzaugg jQuery is a way to do that, but I would recommend sticking to css only.
[15:28:04] <mozzarella> taplar: it's encoded so that /'s are escaped
[15:28:22] <mozzarella> i.e. http:\/\/url
[15:28:30] <mozzarella> how do I decode that properly
[15:28:56] <claytonzaugg> Dang, okay, it's just a lot of work to fix, but hey, at least it's something to do :)
[15:31:27] <johndoe2> claytonzaugg well it's really just a matter of web inspector work. You can change css on the fly and see it in action when you resize your window. use @media queries for whatever screen size targets you may have and define widths and heights for each screen size. for the height for example you can use height:100vh; in css to make it as high as the viewport allows.
[15:34:37] <claytonzaugg> johndoe2, I definitly have @media queries going, I just, well, that's a crap ton of things I'll need to adjust under the media query now
[15:35:06] <claytonzaugg> Perhaps instead of hiding it, I can shrink it and make it all white...
[15:35:51] <johndoe2> claytonzaugg I see what you mean. You can also play with the z-index, hide it behind the content
[15:36:38] <claytonzaugg> Okay I'll try that, thank you
[15:38:17] <johndoe2> claytonzaugg or, with jQuery you could have $(window).resize() watch for the resize and then house everything else you're doing to that div in jQuery.
[15:38:49] <MikeJoel> is there a PDF for the docs?
[15:39:41] <johndoe2> MikeJoel not that I know of. Maybe it's time to pull out that dusty web crawler... hehe :)
[15:40:50] <johndoe2> MikeJoel check out http://jqapi.com/, seems to provide a downloadable alternative.
[15:47:27] <claytonzaugg> johndoe2, I found the solution to my problem
[15:48:19] <claytonzaugg> instead of hiding it johndoe2, I simply margin-left: -9999px; float: left; and that did it.  When I went to a higher resolution, it took away the negative margin and the float left and it works perfectly!
[15:48:37] <claytonzaugg> Thanks johndoe2 for letting me talk it through and ultimately helping me get to the solution :)
[15:48:45] <johndoe2> claytonzaugg awesome, very clever.
[15:48:55] <johndoe2> yeah I do the same, sounding boards help me think. :)
[15:48:56] <microhaxo> Guys, im having some trouble getting nextUntil working.. I have a start element and an end element and its not finding all elements.  https://jsfiddle.net/2g839f1L/  It should be finding all 3 paragraphs but in reality its only finding the first and last.. Any ideas?
[15:49:03] <claytonzaugg> lol yup
[15:50:36] <microhaxo> I basically want to find the .idf-r classes inbetween those two elements including the start and end element
[15:52:00] <mozzarella> I've added thumbnails to the search page: http://i.imgur.com/LITfhia.png
[15:52:25] <mozzarella> now I no longer have to put my cursor over the titles
[15:52:30] <duch_kazatel> woah hey
[15:52:33] <duch_kazatel> so that's pretty nsfw
[15:52:41] <mozzarella> oops
[15:52:46] <mozzarella> wrong channel
[15:52:49] <duch_kazatel> heh...
[15:53:03] <mozzarella> though still relevant… that's the script I wrote ;3
[15:53:10] <duch_kazatel> not okay.
[15:53:11] <johndoe2> glad I didn't click it.
[15:53:25] <mozzarella> s-sorry
[15:55:19] <jphase> mozzarella: you need to grab the index of those elements and determine the start and end of based on the indices
[15:55:58] <mozzarella> what do you mean
[15:56:09] <duch_kazatel> i think he means microhaxo
[15:56:13] <johndoe2> he meant microhaxo
[15:56:13] <microhaxo> what?
[15:56:27] <jphase> whoops sorry, yeah
[15:56:44] <microhaxo> jphase: what do you mean?
[16:01:33] <microhaxo> Anyone have an easy way to get the elements between two specific elements?
[16:01:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:01:40] <microhaxo> I basically want to find the .idf-r classes inbetween those two elements including the start and end element
[16:01:55] <microhaxo> https://jsfiddle.net/2g839f1L/  It should be finding all 3 paragraphs but in reality its only finding the first and last and skipping the middle.
[16:02:23] <duch_kazatel> so let's back up.
[16:02:24] <johndoe2> microhaxo if you're including the start and end, why not loop it?
[16:02:36] <johndoe2> $(".idf-r").each(function(){
[16:03:06] <duch_kazatel> so idf-r is the child element you care about?
[16:03:09] <jphase> microhaxo: you have idf-r wrapped in idf-p
[16:03:18] <jphase> he wants the index of the child, which will always be 0
[16:03:29] <johndoe2> oh
[16:03:41] <jphase> so he really want's the parent's index, and loop through all elements of idf-r children in between a range of those indices
[16:03:50] <jphase> markup problems :\
[16:03:59] <microhaxo> I may have many more idf-r's above and below it, I just want the start ------ inbetween ------ and end element  that are all idf-r's
[16:04:12] <duch_kazatel> simplify the markup for your example fwiw: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fmdo7jj8/
[16:04:53] <microhaxo> I understand the markup is a little busy, but its the exact data im working with and it produces the exact problem i have
[16:05:07] <microhaxo> which is that it skips the middle idf-r and only grabs the start and end.
[16:05:11] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:05:15] <duch_kazatel> calm down duder :)
[16:10:31] <duch_kazatel> microhaxo http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fmdo7jj8/1/
[16:10:37] <duch_kazatel> this is the index thing.
[16:11:44] <microhaxo> duch_kazatel: I dont think i have any way of identifying my startElement index and endElement index, calling .index() on them both returns 0.
[16:11:59] <duch_kazatel> how are you specifying the "start" and "end" element then?
[16:12:21] <microhaxo> duch_kazatel: like this: var startElement = $(".idf-r[data-xwords='" + Obj.startXwords + "']")[0];
[16:12:24] <jphase> microhaxo: something LIKE this: https://jsfiddle.net/jphase/2g839f1L/2/
[16:12:26] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to .closest() to get the parent of them if you're starting at the child.
[16:12:50] <jphase> you need to select your parent items, check if your child items (start/end) exist within them, and add the start/end element as the parent, not the children
[16:12:51] <duch_kazatel> also, i'd avoid using data attribute selectors and use .filter() instead.
[16:13:19] <jphase> I agree with every recommendation to clean up this markup/code as well, obviously, but that's roughly "working" how you requested :\
[16:14:44] <microhaxo> Thanks jphase, i'll see if i can make that work.
[16:14:47] <microhaxo> Thanks duch_kazatel
[16:24:16] <mozzarella> how can I replace the content of a div?
[16:24:57] <duch_kazatel> depending on what you're doing, .html(), .text(), .empty() followed by a .append()...
[16:25:26] <mozzarella> html doesn't take any argument
[16:25:38] <duch_kazatel> yes it down
[16:25:39] <duch_kazatel> *does
[16:25:49] <mozzarella> I'd like something like .html('<p>test</p>')
[16:25:55] <duch_kazatel> which you can do.
[16:25:56] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/html/#html-htmlString
[16:26:21] <mozzarella> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[16:26:26] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[16:26:29] <duch_kazatel> two versions of that method.
[16:26:36] <mozzarella> aaaww
[16:26:38] <mozzarella> that's confusing
[16:26:46] <duch_kazatel> one returns a string of markup.  the other accepts a function/string of markup.  getter/setter style yo ;)
[16:26:56] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty consistent with the rest of the api.
[16:27:15] <duch_kazatel> .text() and .val() are the same way.  .data() is similar, too
[16:29:24] <mozzarella> TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[16:29:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:29:37] <mozzarella> is my version of jquery too old for that?
[16:29:49] <duch_kazatel> what version are you using?
[16:30:20] <mozzarella> 1.6.2
[16:30:23] <mozzarella> same as earlier
[16:30:31] <duch_kazatel> lol i don't remember these things mang.
[16:30:33] <duch_kazatel> gotta dayjob ;)
[16:30:40] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - see where it says "version added"?
[16:31:05] <mozzarella> aaaww
[16:31:10] <Sal> how can i use data as an on selector?
[16:31:22] <duch_kazatel> Sal i wouldn't - use calsses.
[16:31:24] <duch_kazatel> *classes.
[16:31:45] <duch_kazatel> mozzarella you can use .bind() instead.
[16:31:52] <duch_kazatel> or one of the other options.
[16:32:34] <Sal> ok
[16:34:51] <boner> are there timing issues with window.localStorage.getItem()?
[16:34:59] <duch_kazatel> "timing issues"?
[16:44:37] <johndoe2> I'm not sure what else to try guys, can someone take a look at this? My iPhone and the iOS simulator both trigger the function twice: http://jsfiddle.net/no1h4j1f/
[16:45:04] <duch_kazatel> need to define the event object.
[16:45:19] <duch_kazatel> $('#showplayer').on('click touchstart',function (event) {
[16:46:04] <johndoe2> I see thank you
[16:46:14] <duch_kazatel> give that a shot.
[16:51:16] <mozzarella> how can I get the width and height of the document?
[16:51:28] <zcreative_> what is the best way to order an array of objects into a specific order based on a string?
[16:51:51] <mozzarella> well, I mean window
[16:51:53] <duch_kazatel> zcreative is it a jquery object or just a javascript array?
[16:52:04] <johndoe2> mozzarella $(window).width()/height()
[16:52:10] <duch_kazatel> ^ quick google search ;)
[16:52:20] <zcreative_> [{position: 'QB'}, {position: 'WR'}] i need it to be QB, WR, so on in that order
[16:52:23] <johndoe2> exactly :)
[16:52:25] <zcreative_> its a JS array
[16:52:38] <duch_kazatel> zcreative array.sort
[16:56:18] <johndoe2> duch_kazatel very nice, I realized I could spy on the event type with what you told me. I found out iOS devices send inconsistent MouseEvent alongside TouchEvent, so I event.preventDefault();. That's a very long thank you :)
[17:11:10] <derekZero_> Is .animate a handler on jquery or jquery ui?
[17:11:36] <duch_kazatel> jquery.
[17:11:40] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui adds some things iirc.
[17:13:54] <rcyr> Yup.. more easings and color tweening IIRC
[17:22:37] <derekZero_> Can I use .click on a div that contains shapes and text to .animate a menu or can I only use .click on a <button>?
[17:22:56] <duch_kazatel> you can use .click() / .on('click') on almost any element.
[17:23:18] <derekZero_> What's the difference between .click and .on('click')?
[17:23:34] <duch_kazatel> nothing - .click() uses .on('click') under the hood.
[17:23:42] <derekZero_> Gotcha, thx
[17:38:34] <fas3r> hello
[17:38:49] <Sal> any idea why transition not workinmg here? https://jsbin.com/yiralireze
[17:39:09] <Sal> i have a slow visibility transition on the center blue block
[17:41:11] <Woet> Sal: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27900053/css-transition-with-visibility-not-working
[17:41:56] <Woet> Sal: http://api.jquery.com/show/
[17:43:09] <Sal> Woet: what i'm trying to do..... is find a good structure for a modal and its grayed backdrop
[17:43:33] <boner> i've got a fadein(400,function() { console.log("fade in completed"); $('#mytable').dragtable();  } .  The draggable's console.log gets printed before the fade in completed, why is that
[17:44:15] <Sal> i first tried like this: <div class="backdrop"><div class="dialog"></div></div>
[17:44:30] <Sal> but i had problems with clicks on backdrop
[17:44:40] <Sal> had to make too many checks of target
[17:45:18] <duch_kazatel> boner - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jp1awzqh/
[17:45:21] <Sal> now i'm trying <div><div backdrop></div><div dialog></div></div>
[17:45:22] <duch_kazatel> seems to work fine.
[17:45:50] <Sal> anyway... i know its hard to understand what i'm trying to say
[17:45:54] <Sal> so i'll make it easier
[17:45:57] <duch_kazatel> Sal you're trying to build a modal.
[17:45:58] <duch_kazatel> right?
[17:46:11] <Sal> whats the best way to write a modal dialog?
[17:46:15] <Sal> yes
[17:46:16] <duch_kazatel> use library.
[17:46:32] <Sal> i want to know the best way to add clickable grayed backdrop
[17:46:38] <Sal> no, no library
[17:46:47] <Sal> i need to have full control over it
[17:46:49] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:46:59] <Sal> library sux
[17:47:01] <duch_kazatel> wait are you the dude trying to make modals and tooltips the same thing?
[17:47:03] <Sal> i tried many of them
[17:47:40] <Sal> duch_kazatel, i made separate functions
[17:47:45] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:47:46] <Sal> and both working
[17:47:59] <Sal> i only have problems with transitions
[17:48:02] <duch_kazatel> you'd be done right now if you just used a library.
[17:48:03] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[17:48:09] <Sal> they don't work on dynamic added elements
[17:48:22] <Sal> i can't use a library
[17:48:28] <duch_kazatel> "can't" or "won't"?
[17:48:35] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:48:38] <duch_kazatel> either way, good luck.
[17:48:57] <Sal> can't and won't
[17:49:25] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[17:49:31] <Sal> 1 because usually they never do what i need, 2 because it will take more time to study and change others work than doing yours from zero
[17:49:39] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:49:45] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to "study and change".
[17:49:47] <duch_kazatel> you need a modal.
[17:49:52] <duch_kazatel> but either way - good luck :)
[17:49:55] <Sal> 3 i'm a old-style programmaer, and not one of the new copy&paste programmers
[17:50:00] <duch_kazatel> LOL
[17:50:21] <duch_kazatel> great false dichotomy :)
[17:50:42] <Sal> i need a modal that open inside an absoluteb positioned div and then this one has to open another dialog that loads data froma  mysql db
[17:50:51] <Sal> i hav't found anything for that
[17:51:00] <Sal> unless you use 2 different libs
[17:51:05] <duch_kazatel> the db part is irrelevant, and modals in modals is a terrible UX.
[17:51:18] <arc_> agreed
[17:51:29] <duch_kazatel> but i went through that a while ago with you iirc and you just argued :)
[17:51:47] <duch_kazatel> and so i'm just going to step aside and let you do your thing.
[17:51:48] <Sal> in a one page app, its the core
[17:52:22] <duch_kazatel> that sentence dopesn't make any sense, but i'll believe you :)
[17:54:59] <Sal> this is why there wont be another ritchie or a kernighan
[17:55:12] <Sal> u guys just keep on copying and copying
[17:55:24] <duch_kazatel> that's not what we're doing.
[17:55:29] <duch_kazatel> you're using jquery, right?
[17:55:41] <duch_kazatel> why reinvent the wheel on something that's been done time and time again?
[17:56:53] <Sal> because sometimes, have full control of a piece of software , lets you save a lot of time tomorrow when your customer asks to change it
[17:57:19] <duch_kazatel> or you could do the right thing and not try to shoehorn solutions into place.
[17:57:29] <Sal> so, i'm not talking about taking control of jquery, that is a real life saver
[17:57:41] <Sal> but of stupid 2 div libs
[17:57:41] <duch_kazatel> like, trying to redefine how modals and tooltips work :)
[17:58:12] <Sal> they are only damn divs!! oh come on guys
[17:58:35] <duch_kazatel> I'm not sure what you're so upset about.  i feel like you're overcomplicating something.
[17:59:10] <Sal> ok, and i said, its not that
[17:59:20] <Sal> i guy come here asking a simple question...
[17:59:35] <duch_kazatel> oh okay.  well good luck then :)
[17:59:37] <Sal> and for answer he gets that he has to use another ones code?
[18:00:15] <Sal> its like saying: "shutup you stupid, you're not able to do that, go use someones else code for it"
[18:00:21] <duch_kazatel> uuuh
[18:00:24] <duch_kazatel> nope, not what i said at all.
[18:00:53] <Sal> yes, but it make me feel that
[18:00:58] <duch_kazatel> don't see why.
[18:01:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying you could be solving bigger and better problems.
[18:01:21] <Sal> its like if this was a painting channel, i come here, ask how to get a shade of a color, and you tell me to go but it because it already exists
[18:01:25] <Sal> but=buy
[18:01:32] <duch_kazatel> that's not the same thing at all.
[18:01:38] <Sal> yes it is
[18:01:39] <duch_kazatel> sorry you're so frustrated :)
[18:01:41] <Sal> that the problem
[18:01:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> not at all :)
[18:01:52] <Sal> programming is art, its not an office work
[18:01:59] <duch_kazatel> you're positing that i'm implying that you're dumb - i never said that.
[18:02:22] <Sal> its not 8 hour day work, get in. get out, get that put it here, get this, move it therer
[18:02:28] <Sal> wtf! that not programming
[18:02:32] <duch_kazatel> uh
[18:02:36] <Sal> thats filling editors
[18:03:18] <duch_kazatel> you seem frustrated.  feel free to PM me about this, but I really feel like you get the wrong impression here.  Sorry! :)
[18:03:52] <Sal> no, nothing , doesn't matter
[18:04:05] <Sal> its just that i feel that nobody's programming anymore
[18:04:32] <Sal> you guys seem all plubers that put together pipes
[18:04:37] <duch_kazatel> that's a false assertion to make - for somebody so concerned with feeling insulted, that's a pretty offensive statement.
[18:04:39] <Sal> plumbers
[18:05:03] <duch_kazatel> i'll thank you to drop it and move on.  if you want to discuss it more, i'd be more that happy to talk about it over PM - thanks :)
[18:05:18] <Sal> you don't start a web page if : 1 server side you need a mvc php framework
[18:05:49] <Sal> 2 client side, angular mvc, ionic framework, normalizer, reset, etc etc etc
[18:06:11] <Sal> and with the new editors, not even <html></html> you write
[18:06:13] <rcyr> Sal: Are you stupid or something? People are not blind sheeps.
[18:06:38] <rcyr> Good riddance.
[18:07:00] <duch_kazatel> they're just frustrated.  i get it.
[18:07:02] <rcyr> duch_kazatel: I'm a better programmer than you because I program using punch cards.
[18:07:08] <rcyr> :/
[18:07:16] <jak2000> wich is better 1) definition 'click' event on document ready  $('#btnCargaMasiva').on('click', function () {  2) $(document).on('click', '#btnCargar', function () {
[18:07:29] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 neither - bind further down.
[18:07:38] <duch_kazatel> use delegation, but contextually.
[18:07:55] <duch_kazatel> and define your functions outside of the document ready - no need to wait for that part.
[18:08:41] <jak2000> is possible gave me any jquery sample about the further?
[18:09:00] <jak2000> or any link
[18:09:23] <duch_kazatel> sure - one sec.
[18:09:26] <derekZero_> So I used .animate to make a menu easeOutBounce when I click a button, but if I click it again it keeps sliding in that direction. How do I get the element to toggle back to it's original position on the second click?
[18:10:42] <peterR``> has anyone used this? http://jonthornton.github.io/jquery-timepicker/
[18:11:11] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xxswq1qa/
[18:11:18] <jak2000> ok thanks
[18:11:28] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` looks like quite a few people.
[18:12:34] <peterR``> lol, OK. I would like to know how to get the current time to appear in the textbox
[18:13:20] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` there's an example on that page on how to do that.
[18:13:31] <duch_kazatel> pass it a new date object it looks like.
[18:14:54] <peterR``> oh, thanks. I didn't spot it dammit
[18:16:11] <peterR``> hmm problem solved so time for bed. Thanks again duch_kazatel
[18:53:12] <OnceMe> hey I have el1 inside mainView, like <div id="super"><div class="mainview"><div class="el1"></div></div></div> and I have $("#super").on('click','mainview', function () { //stop whatever } and that works fine, but I have el1, and when I do that for el1, mainview will be called first
[18:53:15] <OnceMe> how to avoid this?
[18:55:34] <OnceMe> something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/eaVzx/ but just to work for child and for parent
[19:14:49] <derekZero_> Why isn't this easing working out for me? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pjpjNX
[19:27:22] * derekZero_ coughs 
[19:37:53] <duch_kazatel> fwiw you need to load jquery before jquery ui
[19:38:01] <duch_kazatel> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yYpYrO
[19:39:55] <OnceMe> how about me?
[19:40:27] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to fix?
[19:40:45] <OnceMe> hey I have el1 inside mainView, like <div id="super"><div class="mainview"><div class="el1"></div></div></div> and I have $("#super").on('click','mainview', function () { //stop whatever } and that works fine, but I have el1, and when I do that for el1, mainview will be called first
[19:40:48] <OnceMe> how to avoid this?
[19:40:50] <OnceMe> something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/eaVzx/ but just to work for child and for parent
[19:40:50] <duch_kazatel> copy/pasting doesn't help.
[19:41:05] <OnceMe> I'm trying to fixevent
[19:41:08] <duch_kazatel> your fiddle and your description also don't match.
[19:41:23] <duch_kazatel> so what is the fiddle doing/not doing that it shouldn't/should?
[19:42:01] <OnceMe> I have mainView and inside it, el1, and I have mouseover event with .on, however since el1 is inside mainView, I cannot get it to be clicked, only and only el1
[19:42:13] <OnceMe> I dont want parent aka mainView to interact with anything when I click on el1
[19:42:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[19:42:49] <duch_kazatel> so if you click the span, don't trigger the listener on .foobar?
[19:43:17] <OnceMe> its impossible though
[19:43:24] <duch_kazatel> totally possible.
[19:43:26] <OnceMe> because I have mouseover listener on mainView all the time
[19:43:33] <duch_kazatel> dude
[19:43:48] <duch_kazatel> use the fiddle - refer to the items in the fiddle, not your special names.
[19:44:13] <duch_kazatel> update the fiddle to match your problem.
[19:46:20] <OnceMe> I solved it
[19:46:26] <OnceMe> but not with optimal solution
[19:46:30] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[19:46:35] <duch_kazatel> and i should be able to help :)
[19:47:25] <OnceMe> is it bad to listen for click() inside mouseover event?
[19:47:30] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[19:47:34] <duch_kazatel> that's not doing what you think it is.
[19:47:49] <OnceMe> well it does what I want
[19:48:04] <duch_kazatel> you're re-binding a listener every time your mouseover something.
[19:48:14] <duch_kazatel> potentially firing multiple times.
[19:48:22] <duch_kazatel> if you want help, show your code.  if you don't, just say so.
[19:53:58] <OnceMe> its too big
[19:54:07] <duch_kazatel> that fiddle you made isn't.
[19:54:11] <duch_kazatel> if you don't want help, that's OK.
[19:56:47] <OnceMe> when I make a better one Ill paste it
[19:56:53] <OnceMe> its 2AM right now need to get some sleep
[20:16:48] <tomasm-> hey is it possible to load ajax content from a different domain than the current server? i remember reading issues of cross domain queries... but what if the javascript is loaded from the same CDN as what's sending back HTML?
[20:17:04] <duch_kazatel> "cdn" and "domain" are distinct :)
[20:17:24] <tomasm-> i mean  domain
[20:17:29] <derekZero_> What's the appropriate syntax for including easeOutBounce in .slideToggle?
[20:17:30] <tomasm-> server hosting code
[20:17:55] <duch_kazatel> tomasm- the same domain != same server, fwiw, but as long as it's the same port, protocol, and domain at the browser, you're fine.
[20:19:42] <tomasm-> the javascript and renderable html would be a totally different server/domain, I dont know if that's possible.
[20:20:01] <duch_kazatel> tomasm- so, to the browser, they'd be different?
[20:20:11] <duch_kazatel> becuase you could enable cors, but there are security implications in doing so.
[20:20:11] <tomasm-> from what's  in the address bar, ye
[20:20:13] <tomasm-> s
[20:20:37] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xab6uza1/1/
[20:20:45] <derekZero_> thx
[20:21:09] <tomasm-> basically I'm trying to see if there's  an easy way to serve content to a wordpress site, etc for  a branded  app
[20:22:12] <duch_kazatel> tomasm-  either your end user would need to proxy through their server to yours, or you need to enable cors.
[20:24:35] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, you could use jsonp
[20:27:06] <the_last> hey guys, i'm trying to find a particular table row that has its first td set to a particular value, any idea how i can do this? for example, i have a bunch of trs, and the tr im looking for has its first td as <td>Awesome</td>, and im trying to find the tr that has its first td value as "Awesome"
[20:27:20] <duch_kazatel> *text, not value.
[20:27:24] <duch_kazatel> and use .filter()
[20:27:27] <duch_kazatel> avoid :contains()
[20:27:38] <the_last> okay :)
[20:32:56] <drei> hi all
[20:33:07] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel: I've done something similar, but I don't understand why it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/
[20:34:05] <drei> Does anyone know if there is a way to move all stylesheets from after the <footer> tag to before the closing <head> tag only in IE8 and lower
[20:34:50] <duch_kazatel> drei without hacking in some kind of gross conditional comment system or dynamically inserting things, not really.
[20:34:54] <duch_kazatel> shouldn't need to anyway.
[20:35:44] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ you loaded jquery twice in that fiddle btw.
[20:35:59] <drei> Need to move the stylesheets from the bottom of the page to the top of the page only in IE8 as not working down the bottom
[20:36:33] <duch_kazatel> drei then you have another problem.
[20:36:40] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Do I not need to load once for jquery and once for jquery UI since that library contains the easing I want to use?
[20:36:41] <duch_kazatel> because they should work fine regardless of where you place them,.
[20:37:01] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ the dropdown in the upper left already loaded jquery.
[20:37:29] <drei> even for boostrap?
[20:37:36] <drei> *bootstrap?
[20:37:53] <duch_kazatel> drei it shouldn't matter where the css is loading.  js can matter.
[20:38:43] <drei> even in IE8?
[20:38:57] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[20:39:05] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Removing the external resources doesn't fix the sliding element either.
[20:39:36] <drei> thanks duch_kazatel
[20:39:47] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ i'm aware - just pointing it out.
[20:39:52] <derekZero_> ah
[20:39:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking.  one sec.
[20:42:00] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel There was a typo on one of the #menu selectors. It's been corrected. Only fixed half the problem.
[20:42:04] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ the issue is the border.
[20:43:01] <derekZero_> Funny that crossed my mind. I wasn't sure how to assess that.
[20:43:29] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Am I better off using an image instead of a CSS shape?
[20:43:52] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[20:43:59] <derekZero_> sorry
[20:46:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/6/
[20:46:57] <duch_kazatel> there
[20:47:26] <derekZero_> cool
[20:47:31] <duch_kazatel> animate a parent element.
[20:47:37] <duch_kazatel> and don't use absolute positioning.
[20:48:17] <derekZero_> Hm
[20:49:49] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel How does the menubutton and menubuttontext not get affected when wrapped in that dev? I never would have tried that.
[20:49:58] <derekZero_> div*
[20:50:10] <duch_kazatel> wrong way to think about it.
[20:50:50] <duch_kazatel> check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xab6uza1/2/
[20:50:53] <duch_kazatel> what happens when you click?
[20:51:47] <derekZero_> The border doesn't collapse, but it easeOutBounces.
[20:52:04] <duch_kazatel> right, now look at http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xab6uza1/3/
[20:52:27] <duch_kazatel> notice out the border isn't included the way you thought it is?
[20:52:36] <derekZero_> Oh interesting...
[21:03:40] <ISmithers> Can anyone suggest how I can remove this text (which is an absolutely positioned label) when there is autocomplete data? https://db.tt/3EHvpQCf
[21:04:20] <duch_kazatel> display: none; it?
[21:04:58] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel: Ah sorry maybe I wasn't clear. :) How do I detect there is auto-complete data that the browser is going to add to those text boxes?
[21:05:14] <duch_kazatel> oh, that.
[21:05:20] <duch_kazatel> uh, you don't last i checked.
[21:05:30] <duch_kazatel> use a placeholder lib and save yourself the headached.
[21:05:32] <duch_kazatel> *headaches
[21:05:43] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel: A what-now? Placeholder lib?
[21:06:58] <duch_kazatel> you want placeholder text.
[21:07:38] <ISmithers> Ah, yeah the issue there is that the password textbox has the type set to password, so that is masks the characters to * (asterisks).
[21:07:54] <ISmithers> Hence the placeholder text "Password" becomes "********" lol
[21:08:22] <ISmithers> I looked at changing the textbox type but then I run into the same issue, and also it was listed as a security issue and not advised.
[21:08:28] <ISmithers> What a silly problem.
[21:09:21] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.ginader.de/dev/jquery/HTML5-placeholder-polyfill/docs/
[21:09:37] <duch_kazatel> anyway, gotta jet.  enjoy.
[21:10:47] <ISmithers> Ah interesting. OK will check it out thanks.
[21:15:43] <ISmithers> Works fine, thanks. I didn't know about that.
[23:19:50] <jak2000> how to call this event from other event? $('#xkgsdesecho').on('keyup change', function () {
[23:52:15] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/puu4ss6c/4/ anyone can try help me: i want to change the value of red input and do other operations...
