[02:12:40] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees so can i do this in a better way? :D https://jsfiddle.net/7vyoob1t/1/
[02:13:22] <EugenA> I make ajax request from a function and that function should return the result of ajax
[02:13:23] <Deusdeorum> is doing something like $(".asnwer[data-val'" + variable "']" actually nice?
[02:13:51] <EugenA> I cannot do return in ajax success, right?
[02:16:03] <EugenA> because ajax is async by default
[02:17:24] <Deusdeorum> you can make a synchronos call as well
[02:18:56] <EugenA> then firefox says sync ajax calls should not be used any more
[02:19:29] <EugenA> i think there is better solution?
[02:51:41] <Cork> EugenA: make what wants the data provide a callback function
[02:51:53] <Cork> EugenA: then provide the data through that instead of returning
[02:52:05] <Cork> EugenA: cause no you can't ever return data from async code
[02:52:27] <Cork> EugenA: if you can provide the code where this needs to work i might be able to provide a solution
[02:52:52] <EugenA> ok, one sec..
[02:58:06] <EugenA> Cork: well, the code is simple: https://jsfiddle.net/nxn4rcxc/1/
[03:00:26] <Cork> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/nxn4rcxc/2/
[03:02:11] <Cork> EugenA: if you want to handle ajax errors in the click handler you can just add a .fail(function() {}) after the .done() function
[03:02:25] <Cork> (or you can do the same in the submitStep too
[03:02:27] <Cork> )
[03:03:02] <EugenA> Cork: alright, thanks
[03:03:20] <EugenA> how can I do it in submitStep?
[03:03:48] <Cork> just add a .fail(function(xhr) {}) after $.ajax or .then()
[03:04:57] <Cork> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/nxn4rcxc/4/
[03:05:31] <Cork> done and fail can be used how many times you want, there isn't a limit
[03:05:56] <Cork> .then() does the same as done, EXCEPT it modifies the return value to the callbacks after it
[03:16:39] <EugenA> Cork: thanks, it looks great!
[03:16:46] <Cork> np
[05:00:13] <graingert> Cork: .then doesn't modify
[05:00:23] <Cork> sure it does
[05:00:28] <graingert> It makes a new promise
[05:00:37] <Cork> no
[05:00:40] <Cork> well ya
[05:00:42] <graingert> It's like map on list
[05:00:50] <Cork> but it returns the new promise instead of the old one
[05:01:08] <Cork> so to the developer its that behaviour
[05:01:12] <graingert> Cork: sure but no externally visible modifications
[05:01:15] <graingert> That's the point
[05:01:17] <Cork> i didn't want to dive into the inners of the behaviour
[05:01:28] <graingert> That's not inners
[05:01:28] <Cork> graingert: sure it is
[05:01:39] <graingert> It's very important to know what mutates and what does not
[05:01:46] <graingert> Probably the most important
[05:01:59] <Cork> the first argument you get in callbacks after it is different then what you got before it
[05:02:07] <graingert> p.then(fn); p is not modified
[05:02:35] <Cork> no but p.done(c1).then(tc2).done(c2) c2 gets a different value then c1
[05:02:56] <Cork> and that is what the discussion was about
[05:03:55] <graingert> Cork: but no value is modified. A new one is returned
[05:04:02] <Cork> sigh
[05:04:15] <graingert> Vvv important
[05:04:19] <Cork> for a deep dive into how the dererred works it matters
[05:04:21] <graingert> Because modifications are bad
[05:04:35] <Cork> for the context of the discussion it didn't and would just have made it hard for him to follow
[05:04:36] <graingert> And you don't want anyone to be scared of promises
[05:05:06] <graingert> Just say " returns a new promise that wraps the new value"
[05:05:23] <Cork> but then i would have to go into deep dive into what a promise is
[05:05:27] <graingert> Not much longer but an important distinction
[05:05:33] <Cork> and again for the context it didn't matter
[05:06:51] <graingert> Cork: false
[06:41:22] <pheurton> Am I correct in thinking the $.data() method uses lowercase selectors only?
[06:50:45] <pheurton> Just googled. camelCase converts uppercase characters into hyphens -
[07:28:18] <Cork> pheurton: ya, it follows the name standard for the dom
[07:28:36] <Cork> html hypens up cases the character following the hypen
[07:29:07] <Cork> ex. style.webkitTransform
[08:14:42] <pythdasch> Hi everyone, I'm struggling to build a chat like which have different components and try to handle the calls with a setTimeOut everytime. For example : first_action, wait 200, call_to_api : for each data, wait 200, wait 200 call_another_api_url wait 200, etc...
[08:14:59] <pythdasch> this is my code but I'm struggling to have this setTimeOut. All of the calls are not made in setTimeout. do you know why ? https://dpaste.de/FTbt
[08:18:19] <Cork> pythdasch: i would prob set timer = null in an else case in the if statement
[08:18:44] <Cork> currently you have a tiny chance things doesn't go through the queue even when the queue exists
[08:19:46] <pythdasch> Cork, ha
[08:19:52] <Cork> pythdasch: i would prob start by adding console.log for the state in delay and schedule
[08:20:03] <Cork> it would prob make it quite clear what is going wrong
[08:20:13] <pythdasch> ok
[08:20:28] <pythdasch> y because this function I took it from stackoverflow and though it was good
[08:20:48] <Cork> heh so is about 70% junk for js >_>
[08:20:55] <pythdasch> because I also tried with setInterval // setTimeOut in a ajaxcall / each but this doesn't do what expected
[08:21:06] <Cork> ya, you do NOT want to use setInterval
[08:21:20] <pythdasch> y setTimeout is much more what I want
[08:22:33] <pythdasch> Cork,  But do you think it's the right way to do it ?
[08:22:53] <Cork> not fully sure what you exactly are trying to do
[08:23:12] <Cork> you do some form of popup notification and want it to show the different entries for a little while?
[08:26:39] <pythdasch> In fact it's like a chat but not in real time. It's a perturn chat
[08:27:15] <pythdasch> so first some presentations, after 20 sec it launches for each user a 2min free speech
[08:27:54] <pythdasch> in fact It's like a succession of different actions with countdown
[08:28:28] <Cork> so you basically just want to spread the data out over time?
[08:28:40] <Cork> then ya, its about what you want
[08:30:47] <pythdasch> Exactly Cork
[08:30:53] <pythdasch> ok thank you :)
[08:31:00] <pythdasch> So I'll check this delay function
[08:31:15] <pythdasch> I was thinking also about a sleep function
[08:31:28] <pythdasch> like action1 sleep(200) action2 sleep action3 sleep
[08:31:44] <pythdasch> but doesn't seems to work easily
[08:32:03] <Cork> javascript runs on the rendering thread
[08:32:25] <Cork> sleep would effectively freeze the browser for 200 ms then run action2 then freeze and so on
[08:32:28] <Cork> and when everything is done
[08:32:32] <Cork> render the result
[08:32:39] <Cork> so it wouldn't create an animation
[08:32:48] <Cork> (just make the code slow :) )
[08:37:36] <cannap> do async sleep
[08:37:40] <cannap> it will throws away
[08:37:42] <cannap> xD
[08:44:46] <MikeD_> async sleep is timeout
[08:47:32] <cannap> a what
[08:47:36] <cannap> :D
[08:47:53] <Koopz> sorry i just had the urge to post this here: http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/05/22/a-story-about-callbacks/
[08:50:14] <Koopz> well look at that i didn't even see what was posted before this :D
[08:53:11] <pythdasch> Cork, Ok thanks so much for your result :)
[08:53:31] <pythdasch> cannap, what do you mean by async cleep ?
[08:53:33] <pythdasch> sleep ?
[08:53:53] <Koopz> ZZZzzzzzz
[08:54:24] <pythdasch> Y I know what sleep means :p I'm a python developer :p but in js why should I use a async ?
[08:54:39] <cannap> why not^^
[08:54:42] <cannap> its nodejs
[08:54:46] <pythdasch> haa
[08:54:53] <pythdasch> Y but I've a rigid structure
[08:54:54] <Koopz> make everything async!
[08:55:00] <cannap> no maybe there is something which has a big delay
[08:55:03] <pythdasch> Don't want to add a whole js framework just for one feature
[08:55:05] <cannap> and its sync
[08:55:10] <cannap> this is why the shit hangs
[08:55:43] <pythdasch> how do you make all async ?
[08:55:52] <cannap> code?
[08:55:52] <pythdasch> async before function ? like async function ?
[08:55:58] <cannap> no
[08:56:07] <Koopz> public async function o3o
[08:56:09] <pythdasch> https://dpaste.de/FTbt
[08:56:12] <pythdasch> if you take my example ?
[08:56:18] <cannap> you need to know which part can wait and the other can execute
[08:56:34] <cannap> damn
[08:56:46] <cannap> its vue :D
[08:56:50] <pythdasch> the problem is that all should have the same queue. a function which doesn't need to wait has to wait that they async function finished
[08:56:59] <pythdasch> cannap, y but just to render the results :p
[08:57:12] <cannap> i see callbacks
[08:57:23] <cannap> its 2017
[08:57:32] <pythdasch> :D what do you mean ?
[08:57:47] <cannap> use promises or async
[08:58:09] <cannap> to simplify your code
[08:58:24] <cannap> its damn hard the read the whole
[08:58:50] <cannap> the shit hangs in  fetchParliament: or ?
[08:59:02] <pythdasch> Yes
[08:59:11] <pythdasch> it's in fetchparliament that the shit begins
[09:00:32] <cannap> 1. why you try to mix vuejs with jquery
[09:00:38] <cannap> when you go with vue you dont need jquery
[09:00:51] <cannap> you can use anyway sure
[09:01:12] <cannap> try to remove jquery vue is data driven it will do the dom stuff for you
[09:01:23] <cannap> like you manipulate an array which is a ul li thing
[09:01:36] <cannap> and when you remove stuff in the array vue will do the dom part
[09:03:08] <cannap> i cant read most uf this code sry
[09:03:16] <cannap> i mean i dont understand
[09:04:39] <cannap> you mixed some stuff   this.$http.post + $.get
[09:04:47] <cannap> this cant be good
[09:05:10] <cannap> you use vue-resource + ajax from jquery^^
[09:06:55] <pythdasch> cannap, yes because I need it only once :p
[09:07:39] <pythdasch> y this code is a mess since I tried a lot of things to make this setTimeout working
[09:07:53] <cannap> why you try to make setTimeout work?
[09:08:15] <cannap> i mena for
[09:08:20] <cannap> what you need the timeout
[09:08:24] <cannap> maybe then i will understand
[09:08:29] <pythdasch> because I want all this actions being chronologically with a timeout
[09:08:31] <pythdasch> Ok
[09:08:59] <cannap> hm
[09:09:01] <pythdasch> You should see it as a per turn chat
[09:09:06] <cannap> no clue sry
[09:09:14] <pythdasch> like first turn : user 1 to speak
[09:09:21] <pythdasch> snd turn : user 2
[09:09:43] <cannap> but you dont need a timeout for this
[09:10:04] <cannap> just push and websockets^^
[09:10:05] <pythdasch> Yes because it's like a timer fixed. They have 2mins maximum
[09:10:25] <pythdasch> don't want to do websocket because otherwise I have to do a whole new app for just this feature
[09:10:35] <pythdasch> so I was more in api and vuejs/ jquery
[09:12:01] <cannap> hm
[09:12:19] <cannap> yea i have a problem with reading the code xD
[09:12:36] <pythdasch>  I can understand :D
[09:13:37] <cannap> can you explain like a user story user a do this user b waits while user a.. bla
[09:14:44] <pythdasch> ok
[09:17:47] <pythdasch> https://dpaste.de/656f cannap
[09:18:47] <cannap> ah
[09:19:13] <pythdasch> You know what I mean ? :D
[09:19:14] <cannap> per client of calculated for each user?
[09:19:29] <cannap> or is for same user the same rule
[09:19:38] <cannap> each*
[09:19:47] <pythdasch> what do you mean ?
[09:19:53] <pythdasch> it's for every use the same rule
[09:20:01] <pythdasch> he can speak, then he has to wait
[09:20:08] <pythdasch> till second turn of speaking
[09:20:48] <pythdasch> (like first turn : all of the 10 users will speak and have 2mins each to make their text
[09:22:08] <pythdasch> second turn : same turn each can speak for 2mins
[09:22:22] <cannap> i mus go now but i come back in 1-2 hour then i will give a try because sound interesting for me
[09:22:41] <cannap> i need to go shoping shit is closed tomorrow
[09:23:51] <pythdasch> cannap, thanks :)
[09:23:54] <pythdasch> I'll wait :)
[09:23:59] <cannap> check pm my skype
[10:07:23] <PCatinean> hey guys, how do I loop infinitely over children of an element and click on them every 6 seconds?
[10:07:33] <PCatinean> I think each stops when it reaches the end
[10:08:36] <pythdasch> setInterval + each PCatinean
[10:08:41] <pythdasch> I'd say
[10:08:50] <PCatinean> pythdasch, doesn't the each stop when it reaches the last child?
[10:08:59] <PCatinean> or the interval resets?
[10:09:01] <pythdasch> from my experience no
[10:09:12] <pythdasch> the interval reset
[10:09:26] <pythdasch> setInterval is : Do this every xxx sec
[10:09:30] <pythdasch> and never stops
[10:10:19] <PCatinean> ohhh
[10:10:25] <PCatinean> I think you're right
[10:12:45] <pythdasch> but keep in mind that setInterval will never stop till the page is refreshed or left
[10:14:42] <PCatinean> hmm
[10:14:55] <PCatinean> But settimeout starts the each, and clicks on all of them then resets
[10:15:05] <PCatinean> I want to click on the first, wait x seconds then the next
[10:22:16] <Cork> i would recommend using a chained setTimeout instead of setInterval though
[10:22:39] <pythdasch> PCatinean, y the chained setTimeout is better for what you look
[10:22:50] <pythdasch> I though you iterated over children every 6 sec
[10:23:02] <Cork> setTimeout(function nextItem() { /* the code */ setTimeout(nextItem, 6000) }, 6000)
[10:23:25] <Cork> setInterval is a bit nasty in that it doesn't account for the length the code takes to run
[10:23:39] <PCatinean> btw pythdasch why some variables in javascript have $ before?
[10:23:50] <PCatinean> Cork, does that work? :O
[10:23:55] <Cork> yes it does
[10:24:03] <PCatinean> holy s**t
[10:24:05] <PCatinean> here's what I did
[10:24:21] <pythdasch> PCatinean, the $ is the convention for jquery objects
[10:24:23] <PCatinean> https://hastebin.com/tojidarugi.js
[10:24:32] <pythdasch> if a var has $ before, this means it's a jquery object
[10:24:36] <PCatinean> I guess much nastier than what you did Co
[10:24:39] <pythdasch> like $this = $(this)
[10:24:40] <PCatinean> Cork,
[10:24:46] <PCatinean> pythdasch, ohhh I understand
[10:24:57] <Cork> well either that or it just means the developer is a php developer and puts $ in front of every variable
[10:24:59] <PCatinean> so when I select all divs with class "x" var should not have $ right?
[10:25:06] <PCatinean> Cork, haha :))
[10:25:07] <pythdasch> haha Cork is also right
[10:25:16] <pythdasch> but avoid php :p
[10:25:18] <PCatinean> Cork, should I go with your approach instead of that?
[10:25:23] <PCatinean> pythdasch, coded before, never again
[10:25:25] <Cork> PCatinean: i find the $ in variable names to be silly to be honnest
[10:25:32] <pythdasch> PCatinean, I'm sick of php
[10:25:39] <PCatinean> Cork, they are a bit of a distrction for me as well
[10:25:45] <PCatinean> pythdasch, still on it?
[10:25:45] <PCatinean> :))
[10:25:52] <pythdasch> PCatinean, I'm a python developer :p
[10:25:58] <PCatinean> pythdasch, me tooo! <3 <3
[10:25:58] <pythdasch> I've chosen the right path :p
[10:26:00] <pythdasch> haha :D
[10:26:02] <PCatinean> same! :))
[10:26:02] <pythdasch> django ?
[10:26:05] <Cork> name the variable to have a good name and $ shouldn't be needed
[10:26:10] <PCatinean> no, Odoo (not sure if yo heard of it)
[10:26:17] <pythdasch> Odoo ? nop
[10:26:19] <PCatinean> Cork, should I try your solution instead of what I posted
[10:26:31] <PCatinean> pythdasch, ERP framework, python nonetheless #thebest
[10:26:36] <pythdasch> ha it's a ecommerce framework ?
[10:26:47] <Cork> PCatinean: i avoid setInterval as the plague cause of said problem
[10:26:59] <Cork> especially if you ever need to have network involved in the timer
[10:27:37] <PCatinean> "it doesn't account for the length the code takes to run" not sure what that meant
[10:27:43] <PCatinean> ok so I can still loop over all children as you said
[10:28:07] <Cork> PCatinean: if the timer is say 100 ms, and the code takes 101ms to run it means the first itteration will wait 100ms
[10:28:18] <Cork> and the rest will run continuously
[10:28:30] <PCatinean> oh...ouch
[10:28:39] <PCatinean> so in order to apply your code to my situation
[10:28:42] <Cork> as the function calls will queue up and run after the previous call is done
[10:29:02] <PCatinean> I need to loop through all elements in the selector and click() individually
[10:29:04] <PCatinean> (This is for a slider)
[10:29:11] <Cork> PCatinean: https://jsfiddle.net/yg6qzwpt/
[10:29:24] <MassDebates> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[10:29:50] <Cork> that one will run and then wait 3000 seconds then run again
[10:30:04] <Cork> PCatinean: also you most likely want to involve requestAnimationFrame in this
[10:30:21] <Cork> else the animation will run even when the tab isn't in focus and just waist ppls battery
[10:30:50] <Cork> PCatinean: so https://jsfiddle.net/yg6qzwpt/1/
[10:31:02] <PCatinean> haha nice one MassDebates
[10:31:14] <MassDebates> ;)
[10:31:15] <Cork> that one will tick once every 3 seconds if the page is in focus, and stop as soon as it loses focus
[10:31:22] <PCatinean> wow, that's some hard optimization there :))
[10:31:36] <PCatinean> Cork, you're doing a global good with this information XD
[10:31:44] <Cork> :)
[10:31:46] <PCatinean> It's a huge website, energy company for an entire country
[10:31:49] <PCatinean> People will thank you!
[10:31:51] <PCatinean> XD
[10:32:15] <MassDebates> Chances are if he's helping said company
[10:32:21] <MassDebates> people will have negative reactions to  it
[10:32:36] <MassDebates> I mean, how many power companies were you friends with during your dealings?
[10:32:40] <MassDebates> lol
[10:32:53] <Cork> the local one here is actually very nice to deal with
[10:33:47] <PCatinean> Cork, how long have you been coding in js? just curious
[10:33:58] <PCatinean> and that js libraries to you work with? or just jquery?
[10:34:02] <Cork> since before there was a dom :)
[10:34:15] <Cork> lets see if you can guess at when that was :D
[10:35:10] <Cork> <form onsubmit="document.write('form submitted')"> ftw! :D
[10:35:29] <Cork> so ya ~22 years
[10:35:32] <PCatinean> :O
[10:35:43] <PCatinean> daaamn
[10:35:57] * PCatinean thinks Cork has authored books or is like a co-author of javascript now XD
[10:36:22] <Cork> my first webhosting didn't offer any server scripting
[10:36:35] <Cork> so i wrote my first page as close to a single page js site :D
[10:36:39] <Cork> it was HORRIBLE
[10:36:52] <pythdasch> me was only html :D
[10:37:23] <Cork> ya, but i wanted the nice cgi form response modification goodies >_>
[10:37:37] <MassDebates> That sounds like it was a pain in the ass.
[10:37:40] <MassDebates> Awful
[10:37:56] <Cork> it was awful cause you basically downloaded every page on the site when you visited the site :D
[10:37:59] <MassDebates> yes
[10:38:02] <MassDebates> Well
[10:38:03] <MassDebates> Caching?
[10:38:11] <MassDebates> and besides if it was flat that's not so bad :P
[10:38:15] <Cork> no it was all inline in the page
[10:38:19] <MassDebates> oh
[10:38:24] <Cork> then it document.write the page you switched to
[10:38:26] <MassDebates> well, at least text is small!
[10:38:30] <MassDebates> lmao
[10:38:37] <Cork> ya, like i said it was horrible
[10:38:58] <Cork> the code was "ok" for the time it was written, but the server limitation did affect it a lot
[10:39:12] <MassDebates> Probably wasn't worse than 30s load time per page at the worst, no?
[10:39:24] <MassDebates> If it was a small site, less than 5-10
[10:39:36] <MassDebates> Depending on the server. I'm just guessing here, really
[10:39:48] <Cork> this was 29k modem eras so... :D
[10:39:59] <MassDebates> okay so about 4 days xD
[10:40:02] <Cork> lol
[10:40:16] <pythdasch> 52k were luxuous :p
[10:40:21] <PCatinean> man what a piece of history
[10:40:22] <PCatinean> :))
[10:40:22] <Cork> luckely the site didn't have more then like 4 pages so
[10:40:32] <pythdasch> haha
[10:40:37] <PCatinean> IE 5 back then? barely ran javascript
[10:40:40] <PCatinean> if it did at all :))
[10:40:47] <pythdasch> I think I builded my first one page app in html :p
[10:40:49] <Cork> oh, ie5 was many years later
[10:40:50] * PCatinean kicks IE in the balls
[10:40:54] <PCatinean> rofl
[10:41:17] <Cork> this was in netscape 3.81 time if i remember correctly
[10:41:25] <Cork> might even be earlier
[10:41:44] <Cork> the default windows install was ie 1.2 >_>
[10:42:07] <Cork> (with the major feature of table support)
[10:42:22] <Cork> bad old days
[10:43:16] <MassDebates> IE5 wasn
[10:43:18] <MassDebates> wasn't bad, really
[10:43:29] <MassDebates> You need to remember what the browserscape was back then
[10:43:34] <MassDebates> IE5 was a friggin premium
[10:43:48] <MassDebates> Yes, people _still_ insist on using it,
[10:43:59] <MassDebates> Not a lot by any means. very miniscule
[10:44:48] <Cork> ie4 and 5 was nice
[10:44:59] <Cork> it was after that, that netscape died
[10:45:08] <Cork> and browser development stopped completely
[10:45:17] <MassDebates> No need to develop
[10:45:23] <MassDebates> King of the mountain has nowhere to climb
[10:45:35] <MassDebates> ^ I came up with that and if it's plagiarized I didn't know it existed.
[10:45:40] <MagnusVortex> I'm quite certain I've never liked IE
[10:45:54] <MassDebates> I'm quite certain I've never liked you, either
[10:45:59] <MassDebates> but that doesn't mean you're a bad guy.
[10:46:02] <MagnusVortex> I went from netscape to firefox, iirc
[10:46:08] <MassDebates> It's chances that I haven't really given you a fair shot.
[10:46:23] <MassDebates> But just because you don't like something doesn't mean you _dislike_ it
[10:46:30] <MassDebates> though it very well may be true
[10:46:47] <MagnusVortex> I'm certain I've strongly disliked IE at various points
[10:47:03] <MagnusVortex> And current day is certainly one of them
[10:47:07] <Cork> i went from netscape > ie4 > ie5 > fenix > ie5 > firebid > firefox
[10:47:30] <Cork> never looked back after firebird
[10:48:05] <MassDebates> MagnusVortex:  it's possible you were dreaming about negative experiences
[10:48:15] <MassDebates> MagnusVortex:  And they actually never happened. Why not try IE5 today?
[10:48:26] <Cork> <_< your kidding?
[10:48:35] <MagnusVortex> Gosh, I actually don't remember what I did with the internet after netscape.
[10:48:40] <Cork> i don't think ie5 could even render a search page now days
[10:48:47] <MassDebates> What?
[10:48:48] <MagnusVortex> until firefox came along
[10:48:51] <MassDebates> Noooo way absolutely it can
[10:48:56] <MassDebates> You think google would drop ie5?
[10:48:57] <MassDebates> no way.
[10:49:02] <MassDebates> They want them 3rd world markets bro
[10:49:02] <Cork> lol
[10:49:07] * MagnusVortex raises an eyebrow
[10:49:17] <Cork> i think your thinking about ie6 not ie5
[10:49:18] * MassDebates raises an eyebrow _seductively_
[10:49:42] <MassDebates> Does it matter? The shit is older than dirt and google will still serve it because the data is worth more than the costs of supporting such old UAs
[10:50:00] <Cork> i'm quite sure browsers older then ie6 has no chance
[10:50:07] <Cork> not sure of ie6> though
[10:50:08] <jean-pedro> hi
[10:50:50] <Cork> thins like position: fixed and float doesn't fully work in ie5.5
[10:50:55] <Cork> and ie5 is even worse
[10:52:13] <MassDebates> But the ability to browse is largely unhindered. most of the differences between the two, iirc ( i probably should google to check before i put my dick out there)
[10:52:17] <Cork> ah, right and you couldn't have hover on anything except <a> tags
[10:52:31] <MassDebates> are largely aesthetic and was a big CSS update
[10:52:40] <Cork> MassDebates: i'm quite sure it is a big hinderance actually
[10:52:58] <MassDebates> I just tested.
[10:53:05] <MassDebates> You can fully google in ie5
[10:53:28] <jean-pedro> I'm looking for a sliding image library but with one requirement. I want to be able to download images when I clicked on "next". From now I only found librairies who meed all images to be load
[10:53:56] <Cork> jean-pedro: that will be risky
[10:54:02] <MassDebates> Why would you do that/
[10:54:05] <jean-pedro> Cork: why ?
[10:54:07] <MassDebates> What value does it bring to your users?
[10:54:07] <Cork> cause downloading images takes an unknown amount of time
[10:54:22] <MassDebates> In a sense, the images are already downloaded
[10:54:22] <Cork> jean-pedro: so you won't know if you will have the image in time when you get to the next image
[10:54:31] <jean-pedro> MassDebates: because I'm using base64 images and I have a lot (50 to 150Mb)
[10:54:36] <MassDebates> oh
[10:54:43] <MassDebates> oh you mean like, have it ready for the next slide
[10:54:45] <MassDebates> Oh that's easy
[10:54:49] <MassDebates> preload that and it'll cache it
[10:54:52] <Cork> jean-pedro: i would prob recommend using file resources instead then
[10:54:54] <jean-pedro> Cork: its ok don't worry I'm zen I can wait ;)
[10:54:58] <MassDebates> Er, how big are they?
[10:55:08] <MassDebates> Do you have src selection?
[10:55:34] <MassDebates> utilizing the browser's cache is by far the best option imo if you're just trying to make a slider run as smoothyl as possible.
[10:55:40] <jean-pedro> MassDebates: it depends but I have a lot of images that the actual problem. Thats why I want to load/download them only if I click next
[10:55:44] <Cork> base64 adds a wopping ~34% to file size so for bigger files you want to try to avoid it
[10:55:47] <MassDebates> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ btw I wanted to add this
[10:56:08] <MassDebates> jean-pedro:  preload 2-3 images ahead only
[10:56:23] <jean-pedro> Cork: yes I know I can't avoid that :(
[10:56:29] <Cork> jean-pedro: why?
[10:56:57] <jean-pedro> Cork: well that's the life I had to display base64 images...
[10:56:57] <MassDebates> file size processing duration increase is often shorter than download time
[10:57:29] <MassDebates> because of the connection setups and delays
[10:57:31] <jean-pedro> MassDebates: I see
[10:57:32] <MassDebates> pending, if you will
[10:57:37] <MassDebates> That was really kinda @ cork
[10:57:54] <MassDebates> as for you, preloading and utilizing the browsers cache is important, but using it responsibly is your concern, which is a good one
[10:58:17] <MassDebates> https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/ this is a very useful page for similar concepts
[10:58:36] <Cork> how you load the base64 matters a lot too as if that is done wrong you might not be able to use the cache at all
[10:58:48] <MassDebates> ++cork
[10:58:52] <MassDebates> Yes, he's absolutely right
[10:59:04] <MassDebates> And if you're going preloading, your base64's benefit is largely lost anyways
[10:59:54] <MassDebates> Advise you go back to serving actual images instead of encoded base64. Preloading the images based upon current active slide should be pretty simple.
[11:00:12] <Cork> yup
[11:00:18] <MassDebates> This will become even more impactful when you are serving to phones, too.
[11:00:37] <Cork> ya, especially as they have a much much smaller cache
[11:00:41] <MassDebates> Remember what the differences for processing base64 images are between phones and desktops
[11:00:44] <MassDebates> yes
[11:00:52] <MassDebates> In fact, since it's a slider
[11:00:59] <MassDebates> Probably only 1 slide ahead is sufficient and not overboard
[11:01:22] <Cork> ya, getting a premade lib that does that will be tricky though
[11:01:31] <jean-pedro> MassDebates: exact that's what I want to do
[11:01:55] <MassDebates> I think that a lib might be hard to find, but you probably could jerry rig your own script with some of Cork's kickass assistance here.
[11:02:08] <jean-pedro> lol
[11:02:10] <MassDebates> Then again, I'm sure you're not the only one who _ugh, needed a slider_ and wanted to preload images.
[11:02:27] <MassDebates> So it's possible someone has already done the heavy lifting for you.
[11:02:31] <jean-pedro> hmm
[11:02:46] <Cork> heh.. quick google https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11173456/jquery-mobile-flexslider-slideshow-with-progressive-image-loading-ajax-after#11279311
[11:02:53] <MassDebates> Advise you check out your options first, see what you can find with some google fu. After you've surveyed the landscape for your options, take into account how things will be changing in the future.
[11:02:56] <jean-pedro> I'll try to do it on my own, I will let you know if I encounter some issues
[11:03:27] <MassDebates> Ah, yes
[11:03:30] <MassDebates> Nice find
[11:03:39] <jean-pedro> thx
[11:03:39] <Cork> actually there are a ton https://duckduckgo.com/?q=image+slider+progressiv+load
[11:03:45] <MassDebates> Wow
[11:03:47] <MassDebates> ++ for DDG
[11:03:52] <MassDebates> I like you a lot now
[11:14:33] <PCatinean> wow quite a heated discussion that started with a simple question lol :))
[11:19:17] <PCatinean> Cork, it seems that manual clicks and auto blicks on the slider sometimes mess things up
[11:19:26] <PCatinean> and show multiple elements at the same time, no bueno
[11:24:29] <MassDebates> manual clicks?
[11:24:31] <MassDebates> What?
[11:24:47] <MassDebates> Most sliders give you elements that you can easily latch on to and handle actions with
[11:25:02] <MassDebates> Have you considered just activating the element as opposed to trying something awfully buggy like emulating a click
[11:25:24] <MassDebates> Especially for a publicly-facing production site's main feature slideshow
[11:29:50] <PCatinean> MassDebates, this is some custom slider, not my work. I woul dhave used something standard and customize that :))
[11:31:18] <MassDebates> I wouldn't have made a slider.
[11:31:39] <MassDebates> I'd be interested in seeing the user behavior for your slideshow
[11:34:10] <PCatinean> hmm it's not about the click, i started calling the function directly
[11:43:56] <MassDebates> lol
[11:44:00] <MassDebates> woops wrong channel
[11:45:01] <pythdasch> !op
[11:45:47] <PCatinean> pythdasch, what for?
[11:46:04] <pythdasch> was a bit melancolic about old irc channels
[11:46:19] <pythdasch> where you could !op !kick nick and !voice :D
[11:46:46] <pythdasch> In fact I began to program with ircScript :p
[11:54:47] <PCatinean> haha pythdasch thats quite some nostalgia
[11:55:03] <pythdasch> y :p
[11:56:48] <PCatinean> Cork, how do I stop that function once a users clicks?
[11:57:48] <pythdasch> e.preventDefault()
[11:57:52] <pythdasch> I guess :D
[13:33:30] <robsco> A while back I heard it was safe to put my own object/data under $.myapp for example, e.g. $.myapp = new Object;  is this still considered safe (so long as I don't step on an existing property of course)
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> robsco why would you put it on the jquery object?
[13:34:07] <robsco> so it's handily available without having to create my own "global"
[13:34:48] <robertmaxrees> I'd go ahead and explicitly create your own instead of relying on somebody else's
[13:39:39] <taplar> heh
[13:41:32] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:42:46] <taplar> without creating his own global
[13:42:53] <taplar> 'window' anyone?
[13:44:02] <taplar> just seems like an odd statement
[13:45:03] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:47:07] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/02Ltkwpw/ i have problem with this: when i select multiple for example cat2,cat1,cat3 its sorting auto how can i fix it?
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> "its sorting auto"?
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want them displayed in the order selected?
[13:47:44] <PhpNoob> yes
[13:47:45] <taplar> you want it in the order that they selected them instead?
[13:47:51] <taplar> hah
[13:47:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:48:09] <PhpNoob> how can i fix it?
[13:49:19] <PhpNoob> any idea?
[13:49:28] <robertmaxrees> gotta manually manage the list of which ones are selected/not selected.
[13:49:45] <PhpNoob> manual manage? when i 100 item?
[13:49:53] <taplar> yup
[13:49:56] <robertmaxrees> instead of simply grabbing the selected ones when they user clicks.
[13:50:22] <PhpNoob> how?
[13:50:37] <robertmaxrees> make an array.
[13:50:56] <PhpNoob> i dont know how to do it
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting us to do it for you?
[13:51:17] <PhpNoob> no
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:51:21] <PhpNoob> i just need help for way
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> so make an array out of the handler.
[13:51:28] <PhpNoob> for example maybe
[13:51:42] <PhpNoob> i dont know array way
[13:51:54] <PhpNoob> is there any simple way?
[13:51:58] <PhpNoob> easy i mean
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> this IS easy.,
[13:52:11] <PhpNoob> can you give me example?
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> var someArray = [];
[13:52:31] <PhpNoob> i'm using it in php
[13:52:47] <taplar> huh?
[13:52:57] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:53:05] <Uhkis> s/var /\$/ and it's php :-D
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> PHP has nothing to do with your question.
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> youy
[13:53:15] <PhpNoob> no i just said it
[13:53:16] <robertmaxrees> *you're working with JS here.
[13:53:31] <PhpNoob> taplar any idea?
[13:53:36] <robertmaxrees> wtf lol
[13:53:40] <taplar> i'm lost about your php statement
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to walk you through this.
[13:53:47] <taplar> ^^^
[13:53:53] <PhpNoob> no he said huh and i just ask him
[13:54:12] <PhpNoob> is there any way without array
[13:54:14] <taplar> you said "i'm using it in php" which is completely out of left field as far as the convo was going
[13:54:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:54:44] <PhpNoob> for example cancel auto sorting
[13:54:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:54:53] <PhpNoob> why jquery is auto sort it
[13:54:58] <taplar> your in the client.  there is no php there
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[13:55:19] <PhpNoob> only array ?
[13:55:19] <taplar> select elements do not keep track of the order you select things.  values are selected or they are not
[13:55:21] <robertmaxrees> you're grabbing the selected values.  they happen to be in a particular order.
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could use all sorts of other options buuuuut they're all going to be really convoluted.
[13:56:09] <PhpNoob> which?
[13:56:27] <taplar> perhaps we should ask why the order that they selected the options matters
[13:56:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm not even going to entertain that because you're obviously not interested in my suggestions
[13:56:45] <PhpNoob> there are 100 item in drop down
[13:56:57] <PhpNoob> and someone want to select it for example ten and he create menu after
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> why are you eben using a multiselect in the first place?
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> why not a search bar with autosuggest?
[13:57:19] <PhpNoob> this is an example only
[13:57:26] <PhpNoob> i used sumoselect for dropdown
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> that smacks each term into the bar as a tag.
[13:58:09] <taplar> ok, so hold on.  you are using the select to generate some sort of menu, and you want the options to be in the order that they selected then?
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> sumoselect does that for you automatically duder.
[13:58:31] <PhpNoob> jquery make it auto sort
[13:58:36] <taplar> it's not jquery
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:58:44] <taplar> it's the behavior of selects
[13:58:50] <PhpNoob> taplar yes
[13:58:53] <taplar> right
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a jquery problem at all.
[13:59:02] <PhpNoob> your question answer is yes
[13:59:16] <taplar> "jquery make it auto sort" is a false statement
[13:59:21] <PhpNoob> ok
[13:59:31] <PhpNoob> but still i dont know what i need to do
[13:59:34] <PhpNoob> i dont know array
[13:59:40] <taplar> robert is trying to help you there
[13:59:46] <PhpNoob> yes i know
[13:59:53] <PhpNoob> he said use array
[14:00:08] <taplar> and if you have confusion about that, ask
[14:00:29] <PhpNoob> i have problem with array :)
[14:00:35] <taplar> be specific
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:00:42] <PhpNoob> i dont know it :)
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> really?
[14:00:51] <PhpNoob> yes
[14:00:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't know how to make a javascript array?
[14:01:02] <PhpNoob> yes
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how earlier.
[14:01:50] <PhpNoob> you wrote : var someArray = [];
[14:02:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:02:04] <PhpNoob> thats all?
[14:02:04] <robertmaxrees> that's how you make an array.
[14:02:07] <PhpNoob> is that enough?
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> not to solve your whole problem.
[14:02:25] <robertmaxrees> though again, sumoselect seems to manage all of this for you soooo
[14:02:27] <PhpNoob> robert can you show me in jsfield i gave you url
[14:02:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:02:41] <robertmaxrees> i already told you i'm not going to do it for you.
[14:02:45] <PhpNoob> soo what?
[14:02:48] <robertmaxrees> "an example" is about the same as doing it.
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> why not let sumoselect handle this for you?
[14:03:13] <PhpNoob> how?
[14:03:42] <robertmaxrees> or find a plugin that does.
[14:03:51] <PhpNoob> i used sumoselect i cannot change it
[14:03:56] <PhpNoob> how sumoselect handle it
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> i may have had that wrong.
[14:04:32] <PhpNoob> :)
[14:04:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd find a plugin that actually works for this then.
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> since your real question is "how do I get sumoselect to show in the order i select things"
[14:05:38] <PhpNoob> but is that different ?
[14:06:32] <robertmaxrees> something tells me sumoselect handles all that stuff automatically so you won't be able to change what it's showing.
[14:08:31] <taplar> i'd probably try to use select2 or something like that
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:08:49] <taplar> which goes back to what you said with the tags
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> he asked in ##javascript - guess what their response was?
[14:09:04] <taplar> []
[14:09:10] <taplar> ?
[14:09:11] <robertmaxrees>  <flappynerd> PhpNoob, https://developer.mozil
[14:09:11] <robertmaxrees> la.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/s
[14:09:11] <robertmaxrees> ort?v=control
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[14:09:16] <taplar> lol
[14:10:17] <taplar> wait, they told him to sort?
[14:10:35] <robertmaxrees> it was more of "uise an array"
[14:10:47] <taplar> lol, k.
[14:10:56] <PhpNoob> :/
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> duder - i was about to hold your hand through building this.
[14:11:20] <robertmaxrees> buuuut you just wanted to insist on not doing that.
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> bummer!
[14:11:43] <PhpNoob> i told you i dont know array method
[14:11:48] <taplar> learn
[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'
[14:11:59] <taplar> that is what this room is all a out
[14:12:03] <taplar> *about
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> *you're asking for Free Work™
[14:12:08] <PhpNoob> learn? i dont have time i need it urgent
[14:12:16] <PhpNoob> i'm not asking Free Work
[14:12:18] <PhpNoob> i never ask it
[14:12:19] <taplar> then you are in the wrong room
[14:12:27] <PhpNoob> i just ask help me,
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want a fully functioning example?
[14:12:40] <PhpNoob> i gave you jsfield
[14:12:41] <taplar> you would be better served in another room, or on stack overflow, but even on S.O. they are going to ask what you tried
[14:12:46] <PhpNoob> there is an example
[14:12:58] <robertmaxrees> if it's urgent, check out ##freelance or #css-lance.  you could hire somebody to do it for you there.
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> oh it's ##Freelancers.  neat.
[14:14:15] <PhpNoob> oh comon
[14:14:30] <taplar> otherwise one example of multiple select as tags that remembers selection order: https://select2.github.io/examples.html#multiple
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> dude i started walking you through it and you didn't want my help.  what are you expecting from us?
[14:15:00] <PhpNoob> taplar its onyl work with select2
[14:15:08] <taplar> right, that's the plugin
[14:15:33] <PhpNoob> i tried select2 function but its not work
[14:15:47] <taplar> can you show us what you tried?
[14:16:02] <PhpNoob> i removed codes :/
[14:16:14] <taplar> so try again?
[14:16:32] <robertmaxrees> the current plugin won't do what you need it to.  select2 will.
[14:16:44] <taplar> and that link i gave is a working example of that
[14:16:46] <PhpNoob> current plugin mean sumoselect?
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[14:17:49] <PhpNoob> but
[14:17:59] <PhpNoob> when i choice some item in dropdown
[14:18:06] <PhpNoob> its wrote in empty field
[14:18:18] <taplar> yep, that's how select2 works in that case
[14:18:38] <PhpNoob> if i use this select2 there are need tooooooo many change
[14:18:45] <PhpNoob> thats mean i need to write all of them again
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> so then you can't have what you want.
[14:18:48] <PhpNoob> week week week
[14:18:56] <taplar> lol
[14:19:00] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/8ISSfZb.png
[14:19:03] <taplar> welcome to the world of development
[14:19:05] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#tags
[14:19:07] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff.
[14:19:35] <PhpNoob> why i used select2
[14:19:37] <PhpNoob> omh
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:20:06] <PhpNoob> really i cannot do it with sumoselect?
[14:20:12] <PhpNoob> did you try before sumoselect?
[14:21:46] <PhpNoob> hey
[14:21:54] <PhpNoob> select2 is also same order auto
[14:22:37] <PhpNoob> select green after orange
[14:22:47] <PhpNoob> and its sort like that orange,green
[14:22:48] <taplar> hah, so it is, at least for the multiselect
[14:23:06] <taplar> and tags
[14:23:17] <PhpNoob> whichone?
[14:23:21] <PhpNoob> can you give me url
[14:23:23] <taplar> lol.  so if that is the case, you are back to finding another plugin or rolling your own logic
[14:23:52] <PhpNoob> all of thing is same
[14:23:57] <PhpNoob> auto sort
[14:24:09] <PhpNoob> robertmaxrees am i wrong?
[15:32:50] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees yo hi again can i do this in a better way than i ended up doing it? isn't $(".class[data-val='" + variable + "']") pretty ugly? https://jsfiddle.net/7vyoob1t/2/
[15:33:23] <taplar> use filter
[15:33:54] <taplar> $('.class').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('val') === variable; });
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:38:35] <robertmaxrees> that was a good lunch
[15:39:07] <taplar> lol
[15:39:13] <taplar> lots to read coming back eh?
[15:40:09] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  a bit ;)
[15:42:23] <hellyeah> using for loop and if statement === using filter ?
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:42:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:42:54] <robertmaxrees> one is using a for loop and an if statement, the other is using filter.
[15:42:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:43:21] <hellyeah> hmm as far as i concerned it loops through class and check if data of that class has particular value
[15:43:27] <hellyeah> :D
[15:43:31] <taplar> where you been man.  haven't seen you in ages
[15:43:46] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah the difference is one is descriptive while the other is prescriptive
[15:45:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  try to deal with people instead of codes that also includes algorithm perspective
[15:45:14] <hellyeah> try to find a chance to write some codes tho
[15:45:31] <hellyeah> let me check what prescriptive mean
[15:45:34] <taplar> so same job still?
[15:45:37] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it's simple:
[15:45:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  yeah
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> descriptive means you're asking the code to give you a particular result and let it figure out how to do it.
[15:46:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  we dont have internet at work cuz we are hacked
[15:46:26] <robertmaxrees> prescriptive means you're trying to describe a process for the computer to accomplish something.
[15:46:27] <taplar> wth?
[15:46:46] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  it is really clear thank you
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> it's why for loops are bad.
[15:47:37] <robertmaxrees> also: never use for on a jquery object.
[15:47:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  i work in a bank and someone did cyber attack to bank and people dont have any clue about the reason because they are joke and the only solution is to cut the net. Also they want me to close my laptop
[15:47:58] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i am using $.each
[15:48:15] <taplar> that sux
[15:48:19] <hellyeah> i heard for loop is bad dunno the reason exactly
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each() on jqueyr objects either.
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> use $.fn.each
[15:48:35] <hellyeah> taplar:  that really sucks also they ignored my codes
[15:48:44] <Deusdeorum> sounds scary, bank being hacked, no internet. can people work?
[15:48:46] <taplar> for isn't bad, per say, think of it like this
[15:48:48] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  why $.fn.each?
[15:48:58] <taplar> why use a manual can opener when you have an electric one?
[15:49:03] <hellyeah> Deusdeorum:  barely
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah $.each() is for "normal objects".
[15:49:11] <hellyeah> ic
[15:49:16] <robertmaxrees> so $('someselector').each() is fine.
[15:49:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  yeah that explains the deal
[15:49:24] <robertmaxrees> $.each(someObject) is fine.
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> $.each($('someselector')) is not fine.
[15:50:07] <hellyeah> well the second one i remember what taplar said about
[15:50:28] <hellyeah> two bindings is not good thing to do right
[15:50:33] <hellyeah> also use global lookups
[15:50:42] <robertmaxrees> whatr has nothing to do with bindings O.o
[15:50:44] <robertmaxrees> and huh?
[15:50:46] <hellyeah> like var obj = $('.class');
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> taplar i'd argue that for loops are a bad idea anyway.  as array iterators, you're asking the computer to count and then using that to access indices - which weird.
[15:50:52] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:51:05] <hellyeah> may be not binding i am sorry if i wrote wrongly
[15:51:10] <taplar> the each is going to do the for behind the scenes, no?
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> it might.  it might not - that shouldn't be your concern.
[15:51:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:51:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to describe a particular result.
[15:51:33] <hellyeah> as a result it is iterator
[15:51:44] <hellyeah> i concern  $.each may be syntatic sugar
[15:51:55] <taplar> but that's what my point was.  it's going to loop either way.  might as well use something that already does it vs write your own
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ right.  use filter/map/etc.
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 people don't even want to actually loop.
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> they want to transform, omit, verify, etc.
[15:53:02] <hellyeah> that filter/map do behind the scene?
[15:53:27] <robertmaxrees> the entire point is that they do that for you.
[15:53:30] <taplar> you know what they do.  not necessarily how
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> maybe there's a more efficient way they accomplish it.
[15:53:36] <taplar> and really you don't care
[15:53:39] <robertmaxrees> maybe there isn't.
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ bingo.
[15:53:56] <robertmaxrees> s'why map/every/some/etc are awesome.
[15:55:11] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  to use filter/map is kind of abstraction in that sense?
[15:55:38] <robertmaxrees> they do abstract away an operation, sure, but it's about letting the language handle the details for oyu.
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> so instead of saying "let's count from 0 to some random number, and for each number along the way access and array at that index and blah blah blah"
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "gimme a new array where each object looks like {x}"  or "make sure everything in this array matches a particular format"
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:59:17] <hellyeah> i understand
[15:59:30] <robertmaxrees> basically: stop working so hard ;)
[16:01:19] <hellyeah> hehe
[16:01:34] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  did you hear about "dart"?
[16:04:57] <hellyeah> https://www.dartlang.org/
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> dart's been around for a while.
[16:05:32] <hellyeah> i just heard today
[16:05:38] <hellyeah> what do you think about that?
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah it was released in the 2011
[16:05:48] <robertmaxrees> i think it's a language (shrug)
[16:06:04] <hellyeah> why shrug? :D
[16:06:20] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're asking I guess hah
[16:06:56] <hellyeah> i just wonder your idea
[16:07:04] <hellyeah> hmm is it worth to look?
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> that really depends.
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't personally, but google gets a lot of use out of it.
[16:11:29] <hellyeah> ic
[16:17:20] <taplar> i'd probably have to do some prelim research into it to see the benifits of it over other languages to see if it was worth the time.  paired with if there was a need to improve the current language scape in the shop
[16:18:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> there was chjatter that they were going to try making that a native alternative to JS buuut that didn't work out.
[16:19:05] <taplar> you mean for chrome?
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> for all browsers.
[16:20:06] <taplar> ah, my bad.  i read the 'google relies on dart...' line on the site and assumed it was a google driven language
[16:20:29] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[16:20:46] <robertmaxrees> they want their js alternative to be available in all browsers, basically.
[16:20:57] <taplar> hmm
[16:25:20] <taplar> Dartium browser, heh
[16:27:07] <taplar> mmm, i need to get into node, vue, websockets more before i think about playing with that guy
[16:39:44] <hellyeah> i heard chrome start using dart
[16:39:49] <hellyeah> not other browsers
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> their goal was to get native support in all browsers.
[16:40:26] <hellyeah> vue seems cool btw why google released angular v4 i dont understand
[16:40:30] <robertmaxrees> they didn't really success.
[16:40:31] <robertmaxrees> *succeed
[16:40:41] <taplar> vue isn't a competitor for angular
[16:40:48] <hellyeah> seems google didnt have succes on angular too
[16:40:55] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:41:00] <hellyeah> :D
[16:41:00] <robertmaxrees> they've had plenty of success with angular.
[16:41:06] <taplar> angular is used quite a bit
[16:41:10] <hellyeah> angular v1, v2, v4
[16:41:29] <hellyeah> which one i will use?
[16:41:38] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i just heard from people
[16:41:40] <taplar> have you ever used angular at all?
[16:41:57] <hellyeah> no
[16:42:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use it personally, but if you have to, use v4
[16:42:22] <hellyeah> when v2 is around people sau use v1
[16:42:29] <hellyeah> if v4 is okey then good
[16:42:47] <hellyeah> if people say use v1 when v4 is around.i Angular is failure
[16:43:00] <taplar> afaik, v2 completely changed things as opposed to v1, which some people didn't like i guess
[16:43:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:43:17] <robertmaxrees> they suggested you wait for them to iron out details.
[16:43:31] <taplar> idk anything about v4.  i thought v2 was the latest
[16:43:31] <hellyeah> yeah v2 is re designed everything also v2 has server-side support
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> kind of like when you use node - don't use odd numbered relases for productionm.
[16:43:53] <robertmaxrees> also: lots of people say don't use python 3, use 2, and python certainly isn't a failure.
[16:43:54] <hellyeah> like react
[16:44:05] <ExoUNX> when I do onlick=".toggle()" it works, but it keeps taking me back to the top of the page. How do I prevent that?
[16:44:25] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX use a jquery event binding and preventDefault() on the event object.
[16:44:37] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  you may be right i just said because google changed everything with v2
[16:44:51] <taplar> change doesn't mean bad
[16:44:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:45:08] <hellyeah> yuou may be right
[16:45:28] <hellyeah> but suggestions here learn v4 right?
[16:45:30] <taplar> it just means if you go from v1 to v2 you have to learn the new things and have to convert your app
[16:45:41] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i wouldn't learnm angular period but meh.
[16:45:56] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  why is that?
[16:46:12] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  actually writing vanilla js/ jquery seems more catchy to me
[16:46:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a funky framework imo.  it was written from the perspective of java developers so it's got a lot of java-isms in it.
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> use something else.
[16:46:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  that makes it hard to convert app for companies
[16:46:46] <taplar> right
[16:47:08] <hellyeah> i really missed that kind of conversation :)
[16:47:11] <taplar> but for companies, supported frameworks are awesome
[16:47:20] <taplar> so writing vanillajs/jquery isn't the best thing there
[16:47:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:47:25] <hellyeah> thanks for youır generousity, sharing your times
[16:47:26] <taplar> *typically
[16:47:38] <robertmaxrees> your best bet is to learn js and a few frameworks.
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> get used to how they're used and pretty soon all frameworks get kinda easy.
[16:47:58] <hellyeah> es6 got close to java environment right?
[16:48:11] <taplar> elaborate?
[16:48:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:48:32] <hellyeah> class/inherittance - strong type / may be const
[16:48:40] <robertmaxrees> es6 doesn't have strong typing.
[16:48:42] <taplar> it's not strong typed at all
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> classes still aren't actually classes.
[16:48:58] <robertmaxrees> they're still prototypes with syntactic sugar for using them.
[16:49:01] <hellyeah> i may remember wwrong but that have class/inherritance
[16:49:09] <hellyeah> i see
[16:49:29] <hellyeah> so not still an OOP
[16:49:35] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:49:40] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, like this? https://pastebin.com/w662r65w
[16:49:41] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating OOP
[16:49:52] <robertmaxrees> javascript still has an inheritance mechanism.
[16:50:00] <robertmaxrees> it's just not with classes.
[16:50:04] <hellyeah> ExeciN:  you should use jsfiddle
[16:50:13] <ExoUNX> hellyeah, :P
[16:50:22] <ExeciN> huh?
[16:50:26] <hellyeah> ops
[16:50:30] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX need to pass the 'e' argument and then call preventDefault() as a method on it.
[16:50:34] <hellyeah> sorry for tab mistake
[16:50:42] <hellyeah> ExoUNX:  you should use jsfiddle :D
[16:50:59] <ExoUNX> usually do
[16:51:12] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  donerring about js inheritance mechanism i will dig it
[16:51:55] <robertmaxrees> prototypes.
[16:52:27] <phlix> So i have a data attribute. data-rooms="2" and then on when clicking another element I am using .on('click' and every time I click an item I want it to subtract 1 from the value inside the data-rooms. But it only reduces it by 1. I don't think that when clicking it a single time reduces the number clicking it again still is seeing the old number.
[16:52:42] <robertmaxrees> phlix show us your code.
[16:53:25] <hellyeah> gnight
[16:53:41] <robertmaxrees> see ya!
[16:53:54] <hellyeah> take care
[16:54:08] <hellyeah> happy to conversate with you guys
[16:54:09] <hellyeah> :)
[16:54:50] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, thanks
[16:54:52] <phlix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/54vu599o/
[16:55:19] <robertmaxrees> .data() and .attr() work with different things.
[16:55:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/54vu599o/1/
[16:55:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta stick with one or the other - i tend to prefer .data()
[16:55:47] <phlix> ohh ok
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> though note that the markup won't update with .data()
[16:55:52] <phlix> sweet let me try that thanks
[16:55:57] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to console.log() it back out.
[16:56:06] <phlix> hmm ok let me play with that for a minute
[16:56:37] <taplar> data() is also great for this case because it auto converts the value to a number from a string
[17:10:23] <phlix> robertmaxrees: so I should just add another line to set it like so? https://jsfiddle.net/54vu599o/2/
[17:11:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:11:04] <robertmaxrees> noooo.
[17:11:08] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[17:11:22] <phlix> I don't think you can set the value back in the html with data()
[17:11:32] <taplar> you don't want to update the html
[17:11:37] <robertmaxrees> ^&^^^^^
[17:11:37] <taplar> you want to update the dom
[17:12:05] <phlix> ic.. hmm ok
[17:12:45] <mechanist> hello
[17:12:53] <taplar> bonjour
[17:13:21] <mechanist> I can't understand why the loader icon does not disappear once the upload is done: https://pastebin.com/DurNFxTU
[17:14:40] <taplar> the request gets a 2xx/3xx response?
[17:16:33] <mechanist> I don't know what this means, sorry
[17:17:06] <taplar> look at your network console before you make the request.  you will see the request show up in there and you can see the response code it gets
[17:17:26] <taplar> 2xx/3xx are considered good response codes
[17:21:44] <mechanist> I can't see anything, just "second function"
[17:22:15] <taplar> the network tab, not the console
[17:22:25] <taplar> there should be a tab in there that says network some where
[17:23:15] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide34
[17:28:58] <mechanist> too evasive
[17:29:10] <taplar> hmm?
[17:33:22] <GoSox> Hi. So if I want to change the html-linked css stylesheet on a page, do I just change the href attibute via javascript/jquery? with a new url to a new .css file, will the new styling get instnatly applied, overriding the one at load? Or is there some other step needed?
[17:34:12] <taplar> you'd just include the new style on the page.  though i'd feel the need to ask why you'd do such a thing
[17:34:32] <GoSox> no i'm talking about swapping style sheets. not just applying more styles
[17:34:41] <GoSox> like click a button, completely change the stylesheet on a page
[17:34:53] <taplar> you don't swap stylesheets.  the styles are already loaded into the dom/browser at that point
[17:34:57] <mechanist> taplar: too much reading for just fixing a few characters, I'm sure that's because of it
[17:35:20] <mechanist> I've even tried to change into $("#loader-icon").hide(); with " but no changes
[17:35:56] <taplar> ok?  i don't really see how understanding how to use your browser to debug ajax isn't worth reading a little
[17:36:08] <mechanist> I don't have the time now
[17:36:18] <taplar> ok
[17:37:10] <mechanist> could it be because of this commented line? 			// return false;
[17:37:13] <GoSox> so your'e saying theres no way to swap style sheets? The only way to do what i'm talking to would be to manually change each individual style? that seems crazy
[17:37:44] <taplar> GoSox: your browser when it pulls in a style sheet computes the stylesheet to know how to apply the rules to the page
[17:37:53] <taplar> removing that stylesheet does not undo that loading of rules
[17:39:33] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3182840/removing-or-replacing-a-stylesheet-a-link-with-javascript-jquery  found this though
[17:40:37] <GoSox> hmm that should work easily enough
[17:40:44] <taplar> so if that is accurate, it seems like you can disable the old one before you add the new one, and the old rules will be essentially 'removed'
[17:40:51] <shoky> taplar: it does unload the rules, no?
[17:41:06] <taplar> that answer seems to say you just disable them
[17:41:23] <taplar> idk, never tried it
[17:41:42] <shoky> removing works too or changing the href, i think..
[17:46:17] <taplar> meh, what's an easy jquery ui element?  i'm trying it out in jsfiddle
[17:48:03] <shoky> dialog? accordion, tabs..
[17:48:23] <taplar> i copied some button classes from one of the examples
[17:49:15] <taplar> well i'll be danged.  remove does work, :s
[17:49:30] <taplar> at least in chrome.  *raises hand* i was wrong
[17:49:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c9dzb7jf/
[17:51:32] <taplar> i feel like that wasn't always like that.  especially since that s.o. question exists
[17:54:26] <shoky> seems it was only an IE issue
[17:54:38] <shoky> works fine in IE11 anyways
[17:56:23] <taplar> but again, why do you want to swap stylesheets?
[17:57:40] <shoky> cause you can!
[17:57:50] <taplar> lol
[18:04:06] <taplar> have some js that checks the date and depending on what it is swap in stylesheets for christmas, haloween, valentines day, etc...
[18:06:15] <taplar> brb hopefully
[18:09:26] <taplar> yay, i didn't destroy my box
[18:16:53] <tsukasadt> How can I checked that a variable is a jQuery generated element? i.e., $('<tr />')
[18:19:21] <taplar> you could see if it has the jquery property on it
[18:20:17] <tsukasadt> if(var.jQuery !== undefined) ?
[18:20:27] <taplar> small q
[18:20:40] <taplar> console.log($(document.body).jquery);
[18:20:52] <taplar> it should be the jquery version number
[18:24:42] <tsukasadt> So, this should work, correct? .append((content.jquery !== undefined ? content : $(content)))
[18:25:15] <taplar> sure, provided someone doesn't create and object and put jquery on there to break  your logic
[18:25:39] <tsukasadt> The reason I ask is becuase it doesn't seem to, nor is it erring. :S
[18:25:48] <taplar> you could always just do $(content) and if it is already a jquery object you'll have a little unnecessary overhead, but it would be smaller
[18:26:34] <taplar> can you show in a fiddle what you are doing?
[18:27:46] <tsukasadt> I got it. It was how I was doing the append. I was trying to append to a child of a dynamically generated element without posting that element to the DOM. Posting it first worked perfectly.
[18:28:18] <tsukasadt> ty, taplar, you're always helpful. :)
[18:28:23] <taplar> lies!
[18:28:38] <tsukasadt> That's what I always say to everyone else! xD
[18:29:20] <tsukasadt> Alright, I'm an hour and a half late for leaving work. Just wanted to finish this script before I went. ty for the help. :)
[18:29:29] <taplar> np man
[18:31:45] <toothe> is there a way to filter for an ID field by regular expression?
[18:32:16] <taplar> sure, but i have to ask what you are doing
[18:33:12] <toothe> so, I have tiered drop-down list. Their ID parameters are like this: control_1, control_2, etc.
[18:33:26] <toothe> Within each level, there are other rows like this: control_1_1, control_1_2, etc.
[18:33:38] <toothe> I am trying to make a them hide or show based on clicking a link.
[18:34:00] <toothe> so, i might want to show all control_\d+$
[18:34:20] <taplar> is the markup up for modification?
[18:34:36] <toothe> I'm sorry?
[18:34:51] <taplar> are you able to modify the markup, or is it out of your control?
[18:34:55] <toothe> oh
[18:34:58] <toothe> yes, i can
[18:35:03] <toothe> Is there a better way?
[18:35:13] <taplar> then i would instead advise you to use classes for this
[18:35:36] <taplar> given related groupings common classes
[18:35:43] <taplar> then you can use those for your lookups
[18:36:03] <toothe> sounds good. So, I figured that idea, but then how would I hide multiple layers?
[18:36:24] <taplar> if they are nested, hiding the top layer hides the lower layers
[18:36:41] <toothe> hm...okay, but these are not really nested, they're a table.
[18:36:49] <toothe> <tr>'s
[18:36:58] <toothe> I can restructure the markup if necessary further.
[18:37:01] <taplar> otherwise if you want to be more granular, you could also give the children classes, and then you would base those off of the top one
[18:37:27] <taplar> so lets say for example you have a button in one of your trs that hides that tr
[18:37:43] <taplar> you could do something like
[18:38:13] <taplar> $('.hideMe').on('click', function(){ $(this).closest('.record').hide(); });
[18:38:19] <toothe> are there any examples of this? I might need to see it to understand it better.
[18:38:27] <taplar> where hideMe is a class on the buttons, and 'record' is a class on the tr
[18:38:36] <taplar> though really in that given case you could just go to the closest tr
[18:38:55] <taplar> there was a S.O. post today that was similar to this, one sec
[18:39:25] <toothe> please. This is not my expertise, I am just helping out in jquery/bootstrap stuff.
[18:39:31] <toothe> but I'm the backend coder here.
[18:39:48] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44162581/use-wildcard-to-find-specific-id-using-javascript
[18:40:39] <taplar> err, maybe that's not the one i was thinking of, thought that is also similar
[18:40:40] * toothe reads.
[18:41:03] <toothe> the concept might be similar. We're using a table though, which is not nested as divs can be.
[18:41:12] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44142983/differentiating-between-multiple-html-tables-created-in-the-same-foreach-loop
[18:42:48] <taplar> so the concept is you give things a class to not only group them together, but to give them a common identifier, that is independent of any id you have that would be unique like in your case.
[18:43:05] <toothe> ah, so this is saying you can group them by having multiple <tbody's>
[18:43:08] <taplar> then your logic revolves around those classes and contextual lookups/traversals to find the related elments you want
[18:43:37] <toothe> I think i understand.
[18:45:05] <toothe> okay, so lets say I click "hide" for a top-level
[18:45:07] <toothe> err
[18:45:10] <toothe> show()
[18:45:38] <toothe> if I show based on the class name, that will show everything, even the second layer which I did not intend to show.
[18:46:16] <taplar> it would be assumed that the show is related to the element that it would act upon some how in the dom
[18:46:23] <taplar> for instance
[18:47:02] <taplar> <span class="record"><table class="me"></table><button class="show">Show</button></span>
[18:47:30] <taplar> both the button and the table are related there by their parent '.record'
[18:47:58] <taplar> i could bind a click on '.show' and from there do $(this).closest('.record').find('.me')
[18:48:10] <taplar> and only get my related element i should act upon
[18:48:53] <toothe> I did not understand that, because I am not a jQuery typical user. Let me copy-paste that expression to the person who is doing this and see if that intuitively clicks with him.
[18:49:02] <taplar> :)
[18:51:32] <taplar> and just to make sure it's clear, i'm not suggesting this markup as a solution.  i'm simply using it as a way to convey the concept which you would apply however you wish
[18:58:55] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out.  if you have further questions feel free to ask the room.  others will probably be available to help you too.  have a good evening.
[20:00:31] <Al_nz1> when generating strings from jquery/js for insertion I am getting double quotes, like here : https://hastebin.com/suzogunahu.scala
[20:00:44] <Al_nz1> how do I get it inserting correctly?
[20:00:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:01:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[20:01:13] <Al_nz1> line 5 : value="hello" adelle=""
[20:01:23] <robertmaxrees> that's what your code there shows...
[20:01:24] <Al_nz1> I was expecting value="hello adelle"
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're missing quotes in your js
[20:02:09] <robertmaxrees> '<input type="hidden" value="'+date +'" name="plan.agencyComments[' +i +'].commentDate"/>'
[20:03:02] <Al_nz1> lemme try that :)
[20:06:43] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: works prefectly. Should even the numeric values (which dont have spaces) have those double quotes?
[20:15:31] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 any attribute value should have quotes around them - i assume you mean the name attribute here?
[20:16:43] <Al_nz1> no, I mean for some of the other lines value=' +someId +' etc
[20:17:07] <Al_nz1> for id numbers with no spaces should be ok? but might be safer to have double quotes as you say
[20:17:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah - so like I said, any attribute value *should* have quotes around them.
[20:17:14] <Al_nz1> on the actual value
[20:17:15] <Al_nz1> ya
[20:17:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah always use quotes.
[20:18:15] <robertmaxrees> it'll work without if there are no spaces in the value buuut that kind of inconsistency is hard to follow imo AND if you ever change it in the future to include spaces it'll be a little hard to track down.
