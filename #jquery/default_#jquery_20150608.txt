[00:00:15] <Woet> sp1rs: indeed.
[00:15:58] <t4nk329> Seriously basic question: Why is the attached code giving me "Uncaight TypeError: micropostid is not a function"? http://pastie.org/10228973
[00:16:12] <t4nk329> Uncaught*
[00:16:31] <Cork> t4nk329: check the generated js
[00:17:15] <Cork> (it is most likely coffiescript doing something
[00:17:16] <Cork> )
[00:17:23] <t4nk329> http://pastie.org/10228974 generated js attached
[00:17:31] <t4nk329> I've been trying to work out what's happening for a while now
[00:17:40] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows if you can add an event listener for a css attribute change ?
[00:17:42] <Cork> micropostid( <--
[00:18:02] <Cork> so ya, it is coffiescript failing at parsing
[00:18:19] <Cork> micropostid(+'"]')
[00:19:28] <Cork> t4nk329: try .find('[data-id="'+ (micropostid) +'"]')
[00:19:45] <kokut> cork, is there a way to find when an element on my page becomes fixed?
[00:19:55] <Cork> becomes fixed?
[00:20:06] <Cork> kokut: have the script setting it fixed tell you
[00:20:22] <kokut> cork but id have to touch that file
[00:20:32] <Cork> ya
[00:20:44] <Cork> you could patch .css or .addClass if you prefer
[00:20:52] <Cork> (live patch, not modify the resource)
[00:21:43] <Cork> kokut: there are mutation observers, but they aren't easy to use, and isn't cross browser yet
[00:22:09] <Cork> (and very chatty so inefficient to use if you don't have to)
[00:23:41] <kokut> Cork: mmkay, ill try to find where in the script is the class being added
[00:23:43] <t4nk329> Cork: that seems to have fixed the stray left paren
[00:23:57] <Cork> t4nk329: it wasn't stray
[00:23:59] <t4nk329> I'm still getting a similar error though, give me a minute
[00:24:07] <Cork> t4nk329: check the generated js
[00:24:20] <Cork> it is valid it just takes the rest of the string as a parameter to a function
[00:24:33] <t4nk329> I understand
[00:24:38] <Cork> .find('[data-id="'+ micropostid +'"]') becomes .find('[data-id="'+ micropostid( +'"]'))
[00:25:16] <Cork> (and this is why i H-A-T-E having an inbetween between js and the language you write)
[00:26:18] <t4nk329> I can see where you're coming from
[00:27:05] <t4nk329> It seems you've fixed my problem :) Although, is second() not a valid jQuery selector?
[00:27:29] <Cork> those aren't selectors
[00:27:46] <Cork> and yes second isn't a jquery function (you're thinking ruby arrays)
[00:27:54] <Cork> its .eq(1)
[00:28:03] <t4nk329> thanks a lot!
[00:28:15] <Cork> np
[01:14:59] <Macaveli> What is the simple popup again in jquery/js
[01:15:06] <Macaveli> damn it i keep forgetting the simple thing
[01:15:38] <Macaveli> alert got it :D
[01:15:48] <Cork> O_o'
[02:22:24] <sp1rs> Woet: Is there any other option ?
[02:22:30] <Woet> sp1rs: .....?
[02:23:07] <sp1rs> Woet: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30704712/data-not-get-posted-to-cgi-script-using-jquery ...
[02:23:18] <Woet> sp1rs: i already told you the fields are being posted
[02:23:19] <sp1rs> Woet: i have posted the question on stackoverflow
[02:23:34] <Woet> why do you continue misleading people?
[02:23:43] <Woet> "If I submit the form, in the params only the static field data (ie. those not created using jQuery) is present."
[02:23:45] <Woet> you know that's not true
[02:23:53] <Woet> i showed you they are there. i told you how to check for yourself they're there
[02:24:36] <sp1rs> Woet: It is not working if the action field in the form is cgi script
[02:24:46] <Woet> sp1rs: it is. check your console.
[02:24:53] <sp1rs> Woet: I checked it man
[02:25:18] <sp1rs> Woet: for html path its working ,
[02:25:22] <sp1rs> but for cgi is not
[02:25:30] <sp1rs> i'm not misleading anyone
[02:25:32] <Woet> sp1rs: make a screenshot of your browser with the network tab open showing the request
[02:25:39] <sp1rs> ok wait
[02:31:57] <sp1rs> Woet: http://i.imgur.com/MBOCSXL.png
[02:32:59] <Woet> sp1rs: doesn't look like the same code as the jsfiddle to me.
[02:49:37] <sp1rs> Woet: It is the same code man
[02:51:03] <Woet> sp1rs: so whats all the stuff on the left?
[02:52:17] <sp1rs> its the different thing .. doesnot related to what my problem is
[02:52:42] <Woet> if it's not related, why did you leave it there?
[02:52:56] <Woet> fairly important during debugging to rule out any other issues
[02:53:03] <Woet> so get rid of anything unrelated. just like jsfiddle.
[02:54:50] <sp1rs> Woet: the things you see on left is totally different .. see i'm working on creating a dashboard , i have shown only the part of code in which i'm facing the problem
[02:54:59] <Woet> sp1rs: it. doesn't. matter.
[02:55:21] <Woet> sp1rs: get rid of /everything/ that's not related to your issue to rule out it interfering
[02:55:25] <sp1rs> what matter is that if cgi script is called only the static field value get posted
[02:55:38] <Woet> even though I showed you the code works fine and the fields are getting posted
[02:56:07] <sp1rs> Woet: it is when in the action form you replaced launcher.cgi with /echo/html
[02:56:16] <sp1rs> its work fine for me alos
[02:56:19] <sp1rs> *also
[02:56:34] <Woet> sp1rs: nope - http://jsfiddle.net/15zjsbn1/7/
[02:56:41] <Woet> works entirely fine when it's launcher.cgi
[02:57:03] <Woet> can you stop making wrong assumptions now?
[02:58:00] <dw1> NO!
[02:58:11] <dw1> i mean hi
[02:58:42] <Tahr-user> hello
[02:59:29] <pepperpot> Download either SEO Analyzer full script, Website Value Calvulator Full Script, or Ajax Star Reviews script, all fully tested and working, download them for your website, you're welcome! https://www.criosphinx.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=20
[03:03:57] <sp1rs> Woet: may be its working on the jsfiddle but its not working on my local server
[03:03:59] <sp1rs> :(
[03:04:19] <Woet> sp1rs: okay, and HTML/javascript is client side. whats your point?
[03:06:43] <sp1rs>  Woet see i have a cgi script present in /cgi-bin folder .. whenever the form is submitted only the default field value is passed in the params ,
[03:07:05] <sp1rs> cgi script is  bascaily a server side process
[03:07:22] <Woet> sp1rs: which isn't relevant since you're checking in your browser, which is unrelated to whatever your CGI script does
[03:08:18] <sp1rs> Woet: cgi is basically a background process , but i need to pass all the values of the form
[03:08:27] <sp1rs> which i'm not able to do it
[03:08:50] <Woet> sp1rs: your CGI script is not relevant, I just told you this
[03:08:56] <sp1rs> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30704712/data-not-get-posted-to-cgi-script-using-jquery
[03:08:59] <sp1rs> Woet: yes
[03:09:09] <sp1rs> Woet: but then what is the problme ?
[03:09:09] <Woet> why do you keep linking the same thing over and over?
[03:09:20] <Woet> sp1rs: you not getting rid of other code.
[03:09:24] <Woet> sp1rs: you not being able to debug
[03:11:19] <Woet> sp1rs: since you've been at this for hours and the jsfiddle works fine, why not just link to your webpage where you're having this issue?
[03:16:01] <prohobo> what the hell
[03:25:41] <prohobo> can someone explain this to me?
[03:25:44] <prohobo> http://i.imgur.com/3DLr3mY.png
[03:26:04] <prohobo> i make two console.log() calls of two different jquery selectors
[03:26:15] <prohobo> which are supposed to be logically the same
[03:26:23] <prohobo> but i get two different results
[03:26:26] <Woet> prohobo: www.jsfiddle.net
[03:26:31] <Xatenev> prohobo: really?
[03:26:32] <Xatenev> an image?
[03:26:33] <Xatenev> :p
[03:26:35] <prohobo> yes
[03:26:41] <Woet> an image with a font size made for ants
[03:26:42] <prohobo> i cant reproduce it in jsfiddle
[03:26:48] <Woet> then your issue is invalid
[03:26:49] <Xatenev> Atlaest write it in jsfiddle then
[03:27:05] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/9uc1r65m/3/
[03:27:06] <Woet> i dont know why people think jsfiddle is some magical environment that makes broken things work
[03:27:09] <prohobo> the jsfiddle works fine
[03:27:10] <Woet> if it works on jsfiddle, you're doing it wrong.
[03:27:17] <Woet> then the issue is elsewhere
[03:27:29] <Woet> fairly obvious
[03:27:33] <prohobo> yeah
[03:27:37] <prohobo> but it doesnt make sense
[03:27:44] <prohobo> the queries are god damn same
[03:27:48] <Woet> you made a screenshot of your issue
[03:27:50] <CreativeWolf> Heya all :)
[03:27:54] <Woet> it results into something different than jsfiddle
[03:27:57] <Woet> what does that tell you?
[03:28:09] <prohobo> nothing really
[03:28:11] <Woet> .
[03:28:17] <Woet> it tells you that your code on jsfiddle is different
[03:28:50] <Woet> or your environment is different, but i'm assuming you use the same browser with the same settings and the same plugins
[03:29:43] <prohobo> do you see what happened in the pic tho?
[03:29:46] <prohobo> its insane
[03:30:07] <prohobo> same query, at the same time, different results
[03:30:10] <Xatenev> prohobo: cause u got a compltely differnet html structure
[03:30:10] <prohobo> WHAT
[03:30:13] <Xatenev> thats how it looks
[03:30:16] <Woet> it doesn't mention any code so no, i dont see what happens
[03:30:28] <Xatenev> i dont see any service-override-form
[03:30:29] <Woet> also what Xatenev said
[03:30:30] <Xatenev> in ur jsfiddle
[03:30:39] <prohobo> its the container
[03:30:40] <Woet> i told you the jsfiddle has different code
[03:30:52] <prohobo> it has the same structure
[03:30:55] <prohobo> just diff names
[03:31:03] <Xatenev> yea and somewhere is the problem
[03:31:06] <Xatenev> u think it has the same structure
[03:31:07] <Xatenev> but it doesnt
[03:31:08] <Woet> so why did you bother giving them different names?
[03:31:15] <Xatenev> so grab everything u have in ur real code
[03:31:16] <Woet> i told you the issue is that the code is not the same
[03:31:17] <Xatenev> put it into js fiddle
[03:31:19] <Woet> so give it the same code
[03:31:26] <Woet> why do people always make it so complicated
[03:31:43] <Woet> code A has a problem, so they put code B on the jsfiddle and then complain it works fine on jsfiddle
[03:31:44] <Woet> so confusing
[03:31:53] <Xatenev> Woet: ^^
[03:31:55] <prohobo> Woet you're just assuming im a moron
[03:32:06] <Xatenev> prohobo: actually ur acting like one
[03:32:06] <Xatenev> :)
[03:32:08] <prohobo> no thanks
[03:32:09] <Xatenev> code isnt magic.
[03:32:15] <Xatenev> Something HAS to be different
[03:32:19] <Xatenev> u get me?
[03:32:25] <Woet> well you're unable to replicate a client-side issue
[03:32:25] <Xatenev> code doesnt just act different cause its code.
[03:32:29] <Woet> its pretty hard to mess up
[03:34:10] <prohobo> here's my code
[03:34:11] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/9uc1r65m/4/
[03:34:13] <prohobo> happy?
[03:34:16] <prohobo> same shit
[03:34:18] <prohobo> works fine
[03:35:54] <prohobo> it's like
[03:36:01] <prohobo> it's like the elements "flicker"
[03:36:09] <prohobo> in the environment outside of jsfiddle
[03:36:21] <prohobo> they're there for the first query, gone for the next
[03:36:27] <Xatenev> i see service-override.engaged here
[03:36:31] <Xatenev> where is engaged?
[03:36:35] <Xatenev> in ur img atleast
[03:36:50] <prohobo> that's a different script
[03:36:53] <prohobo> a selectable
[03:37:09] <Woet> .
[03:37:16] <Woet> so you don't include all the scripts you have running
[03:37:18] <Xatenev> prohobo: u get me.
[03:37:19] <prohobo> you dont say Woet
[03:37:19] <Xatenev> :p
[03:37:21] <Woet> and yet you're confused about having the same result
[03:37:28] <Woet> err, different result
[03:37:35] <Woet> just link your webpage where this happens
[03:37:40] <Xatenev> create a real working testcase and come back :)
[03:37:52] <Xatenev> u have to understand what is causing ur problem first
[03:37:54] <Xatenev> in order to solve it :)
[03:38:09] <prohobo> yeah, ie. you're just trying to be dicks because i asked wrong
[03:38:11] <prohobo> thanks
[03:38:14] <Xatenev> prohobo: great
[03:38:15] <Xatenev> see ya
[03:38:33] <prohobo> Xatenev: that's exactly what this is about
[03:38:39] <Xatenev> prohobo: NO
[03:38:43] <Xatenev> u are having obviously other scripts running
[03:38:47] <Xatenev> which cause diferent stuff
[03:38:48] <Xatenev> code isnt magical
[03:38:49] <prohobo> yes
[03:38:50] <Woet> prohobo: no, you're refusing to follow our directions
[03:38:54] <Xatenev> there is something which causes problems
[03:38:58] <Xatenev> and ur not including it in ur jsfiddle
[03:39:02] <Xatenev> and ur really wondering
[03:39:05] <Xatenev> that its working on jsfiddle
[03:39:06] <Xatenev> are u serious?
[03:39:09] <Woet> prohobo: if you get a different result, it's different code
[03:39:26] <Xatenev> im done
[03:39:38] <Woet> same issue with sp1rs
[03:39:41] <Woet> don't know what's going on today
[03:46:00] <prohobo> figured it out
[03:46:42] <prohobo> the selected container didnt exist when i assigned it
[03:47:28] <prohobo> its always the same crap in these channels
[03:48:06] <prohobo> i gave you enough information to make an educated guess about what was wrong
[03:48:26] <prohobo> but that wasn't enough because you'd have to actually think about it
[03:48:43] <prohobo> so instead im just a moron who can't ask questions properly
[03:54:15] <Woet> prohobo: if only you pasted the actual code
[03:55:24] <prohobo> i did
[03:55:40] <prohobo> you just couldnt pull your head out of your ass long enough to read it
[03:56:52] <sp1rs> prohobo: what was your problem ?
[03:56:56] <CreativeWolf> I'm trying to get a carousel type image swiping done using jQuery Mobile - The demo here http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/swipe-page/ shows swiping the entire page - any way to change only content and not the page? Appreciate any help please.
[03:57:42] <prohobo> sp1rs i had two console logs of different constructed jquery selectors that were showing the same literal selector expression but getting different results
[03:57:54] <prohobo> the first selection was using a literal
[03:58:03] <prohobo> the second was using a previously selected element
[03:58:16] <prohobo> turned out the previously selected element just wasnt assigned properly
[03:59:36] <prohobo> but all they kept telling me was "create a live version" and smiling a lot
[03:59:51] <troop> hello, jquery validation engine says always 200 parseerror, anyone experienced?
[04:06:56] <saransh__> hi, when i am scrolling down the sticky sidebar changes it's size. How to remove that?
[04:07:00] <saransh__> http://beaconstac.staging.wpengine.com/introducing-the-beaconstac-app-watch-beacons-in-action/
[04:12:18] <saransh__> Can anyone look into it once?
[04:28:59] <Xatenev> prohobo: sadly u still dont get the point^^
[04:29:18] <jason001> hi guys, i'm having some trouble getting query to work with my cakephp
[04:29:52] <Xatenev> jason001: what version of cakephp?
[04:29:56] <jason001> 3.x
[04:30:11] <Xatenev> jason001: jquery comes already packaged with the framework i think
[04:30:18] <jason001> in my layout/default.ctp, i have $this->Html->script('jquery')
[04:30:28] <Xatenev> jason001: u should go into the cakephp irc
[04:30:38] <Xatenev> and ask people who have jquery bundled inside their applications
[04:30:52] <jason001> lol cakephp sent me here :(
[04:31:12] <Xatenev> makes no sense
[04:31:18] <Xatenev> cause this is not a jquery problem
[04:32:01] <Xatenev> jason001: please ask in #cakephp again
[04:32:05] <jason001> it really isn't, but figured i'd give it a shot! thanks anyway Xatenv

[05:05:45] <toomus> Hi all
[05:06:00] <toomus> How to fix this code http://pastie.org/private/xnb2b5mgmfjuugfhecwaw
[05:08:53] <toomus> The problem is how to access element on which function was called?
[05:10:02] <Cork> toomus: you have som problems with the plugin
[05:10:14] <Cork> toomus: this inside a jquery plugin isn't a dom element
[05:10:24] <Cork> it is always a jquery object
[05:10:57] <Cork> so delegate on $(this) makes no sense
[05:11:03] <toomus> Cork: so it can't be done this way?
[05:11:08] <Cork> no
[05:11:28] <toomus> I should pass element in function params?
[05:11:38] <Cork> you should create $.blockEmpty = function(selector) {}
[05:11:47] <toomus> OK
[05:12:04] <Cork> where selector is a string
[05:12:38] <Cork> toomus: secondly .attr('disabled', false) prop not attr
[05:12:51] <toomus> Cork: OK :)
[05:16:35] <prohobo> what's the difference between prop and attr
[05:16:41] <prohobo> doesn't prop not update the DOM?
[05:18:38] <Cork> prohobo: prop == property attr == attribute
[05:18:54] <Cork> prohobo: so attr gets and sets the html attribute (set/getAttribute)
[05:19:04] <Cork> prohobo: while prop sets the property value directly on the dom element
[05:19:20] <Cork> elm.disabled = true === .prop('disabled', true)
[05:19:34] <prohobo> hmm okay
[05:19:38] <prohobo> i think i see
[05:19:40] <Cork> prohobo: and some browsers doesn't monitor the setAttribute for state changes
[05:19:56] <Cork> so if you do setAttribute('disabled', '') they don't detect that
[05:20:00] <prohobo> so attr is changing html
[05:20:09] <Cork> also setAttribute('disabled', false) != disabled = false
[05:20:14] <prohobo> but prop changes the actual object
[05:20:17] <Cork> prohobo: kinda, but not really
[05:20:28] <Cork> it is all objects, there isn't any html anymore
[05:20:35] <prohobo> O_O
[05:20:37] <Cork> but attr is the string that came from the html
[05:20:38] <prohobo> my god
[05:20:51] <Cork> while prop is the state the browser is working with
[05:20:58] <prohobo> yeah so attr is more like working with literal values
[05:21:08] <Cork> the original, not literal
[05:21:16] <prohobo> hm
[05:21:17] <mooncup> http://cdn.meme.am/instances/46864307.jpg
[05:21:21] <mooncup> Cork irl ^
[05:21:32] <prohobo> sounds like python
[05:21:52] <Cork> the best example i have is <a href="#top"> .attr('href') == '#top'; prop('href') == 'https://www.example.com/path/to/file.html#top'
[05:22:22] <Cork> and that is one of the very few cases when you actually want .attr
[05:22:25] <prohobo> hmm
[05:22:35] <Cork> in 90+% of the time .prop is what you want
[05:22:41] <prohobo> so layout vs. programming
[05:22:45] <prohobo> damn dude
[05:22:50] <prohobo> i've been using attr exclusively
[05:22:57] <prohobo> because i never saw what prop was even for
[05:23:07] <Cork> prohobo: that was correct until ~1.7 i think
[05:23:13] <Cork> then they split attr in to attr and prop
[05:23:14] <prohobo> 1.7 what
[05:23:21] <prohobo> jquery?
[05:23:22] <Cork> ?api prop
[05:23:22] <b-ot> Cork: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[05:23:28] <prohobo> ah
[05:23:37] <Cork>  version added: 1.6
[05:24:07] <Cork> before 1.6 attr did magic to try to give you what it thought you actually wanted
[05:24:20] <Cork> this magic was removed in 1.6 and instead you pick what you want
[05:41:46] <FilipNortic> what does $('*') mean? select everything?
[05:42:04] <slax0r> probably
[05:44:31] <FilipNortic>  $('*').live('click',function (e): found this in a commit. Is it old delegate syntax?
[05:45:34] <Xatenev> FilipNortic: yeap its deprecated
[05:45:41] <Xatenev> since 1.6 or 1.7~~
[05:46:13] <Xatenev> FilipNortic: nowadays its just .on('
[05:48:20] <FilipNortic> but $('*').on('click ... would place a click event on all dom elements in document or is the trick here that it trigger before most dom events are created?
[05:49:08] <Xatenev> FilipNortic: yup it makes no sense
[05:49:09] <Xatenev> :P
[05:49:22] <Cork> FilipNortic: $('*').live('click') == $(document).on('click', '*')
[05:49:41] <Cork> meaning it binds once on the document ignores the elements found by $('*')
[05:49:52] <Cork> and reuses the selector used for that query
[05:50:01] <Xatenev> Cork: but does it make any sense?
[05:50:11] <Cork> it doesn't, and it is wasteful
[05:50:15] <Cork> that is why it was removed
[05:50:28] <Cork> aka, a bad api
[05:51:02] <notchris> When injecting text, how do I strip HTML?
[05:51:08] <notchris> use .text() ?
[05:51:22] <Cork> is the text html when you get it or is it a dom element?
[05:51:23] <Xatenev> .text() is safe
[05:51:25] <Xatenev> normally
[05:51:36] <notchris> I have a variable that alreay has html content
[05:51:40] <notchris> so I could do like
[05:51:50] <Cork> then $($.parseHTML(variable)).text()
[05:51:53] <notchris> var x = foo.text();
[05:52:01] <notchris> ahh
[05:52:05] <Cork> if you can then it isn't html
[05:54:02] <notchris> It livessssss
[05:54:08] <notchris> Thanks @Cork / Xatenev
[05:55:44] <FilipNortic> hmm seems like that pages has it's own custom header and uses jQuery 1.5... then live is the way to go unless i can update it
[05:56:12] <notchris> I have a list, when clicking on an item, I hide the other list items to show only the clicked one
[05:56:20] <notchris> However, it does not bring the select one to the top
[05:56:26] <notchris> It maintains it’s position
[06:04:56] <Cork> notchris: sounds like you use opacity or visibility
[06:05:10] <Cork> notchris: so the elements still take up the same amount of space as if they where still there
[06:07:06] <notchris> Cork: Yes
[06:08:57] <FilipNortic> notchris: so you're not using show()/hide() ?
[06:09:21] <notchris> FilipNortic: I am
[06:14:10] <notchris> Got it working woo
[06:33:33] <SuperTyp> hello, how can I set the position of jquery mobile loader?
[06:33:48] <SuperTyp> I mean relative to my form e.g.
[06:33:51] <effortDee> css
[06:33:55] <SuperTyp> thanks
[06:33:56] <effortDee> #css
[06:33:57] <effortDee> :)
[06:34:00] <effortDee> will do it for yo
[06:34:41] <SuperTyp> great, thats what I wanted to know, jquery validator has an positionTo option
[06:35:19] <SuperTyp> would be nice to have it for the loader too, where can I make a request? :P
[07:02:41] <troop> does anyone use jquery validation engine
[07:08:47] <SuperTyp> troop, plugin?
[07:09:08] <troop> SuperTyp: i mean this https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine
[07:09:51] <SuperTyp> troop: no then
[07:10:14] <troop> okk
[07:10:45] <troop> SuperTyp: do you know any good ajax form validation script?
[07:11:17] <troop> i want to check existence of username and email before submit form
[07:16:46] <jhass> using http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/, how can I know whether the DOM position changed in the stop event?
[07:27:21] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:27:39] <jop008> debugging in chrome http://picpaste.com/upload.php the statement window.location.href = nexturl is processed but no navigation is done. Is this in debugmode only?
[07:27:40] <notchris> Hello
[07:30:36] <rindolf> notchris: hi.
[07:30:46] <notchris> How’s it going
[07:36:09] <rindolf> notchris: it's going fine - I wrote a facebook post about the board/cards/etc. events that I went to yesterday .
[07:36:34] <rindolf> notchris: I'm glad I went to it eventually.
[07:41:04] <notchris> rindolf: Nice!
[07:41:18] <rindolf> notchris: how's it going with you?
[07:52:19] <notchris> rindolf: Not bad, working on a meteor app

[08:12:58] <dominicrooijacke> Hello, does anyone know anything about jquery and support for the new 'edge' browser comming in windows 10 ?
[08:13:33] <Cork> dominicrooijacke: it will most likely work just fine
[08:13:51] <Cork> cause the only special code jquery need to keep is if the browser has bugs
[08:14:25] <dominicrooijacke> I know, so I was wondering if there are already known compatability issues
[08:14:38] <Cork> is the browser even released yet?
[08:14:46] <dominicrooijacke> I have tested several sites with the preview version of windows 10
[08:15:42] <dominicrooijacke> some look off.
[08:15:59] <Cork> ya, but i don't think that depends on jquery
[08:16:43] <dominicrooijacke> oke
[08:31:14] <dominicrooijacke> what about this ? https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97917
[08:34:33] <gnarf> dominicrooijacke jquery.client is a plugin
[08:35:19] <dominicrooijacke> oke
[08:35:32] <gnarf> dominicrooijacke: noone has opened any issues on the jQuery bug tracker about windows 10 yet
[08:35:45] <dominicrooijacke> oke
[08:36:03] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues
[08:36:40] <dominicrooijacke> gnarf thank you for the info
[08:37:49] <gnarf> a closer search finds https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2357
[08:38:03] <gnarf> watch that issue to get updates / ping people asking what this means

[08:38:22] <gnarf> I'm sure @markelog or @dmethvin will help out dominicrooijacke
[08:39:02] <gnarf> dimi1947: note how the syntax highlighting is off -- you start your string with " but end it with '
[08:39:05] <gnarf> it should be either " or ' for both ;)
[08:39:15] <gnarf> "#Monday'
[08:40:53] <dimi1947> I corrected the quoted issue....it still does not work
[08:41:12] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/49/
[08:41:20] <robertmaxrees> open your console :)
[08:41:54] <robertmaxrees> your var days = {} isn't valid.
[08:44:05] <dimi1947> it really had not crossed my mind this is what was causing the problem....and in addition to this I do not know what file I have to access in the console-that corresponds tp jsfiddle
[08:44:40] <dimi1947> I found the file...index
[08:44:45] <robertmaxrees> errr..
[08:45:03] <robertmaxrees> the console doesn't correspond to a particular file when using jsfiddle.
[08:45:11] <robertmaxrees> it corresponds to the entirety of the window.
[08:57:27] <Jeroen2> If I do this: Mode: {{ modus }} I get Mode: [{"values": [{"value":"21"}], "count":"1"}]. How do I get the values after "Mode:" so for exmaple: "Mode: 21".
[08:57:47] <mynameisbrian> If I do: $(element).fadeOut(500, function(){ $(another_element).fadeIn() }) shouldn't element fade out, before another_element begins to fade in?
[08:58:05] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 you want '21' ?
[08:59:31] <Jeroen2> Yes
[08:59:37] <mynameisbrian> [0]['values'][0]'value']
[08:59:44] <mynameisbrian> [0]['values'][0]['value']
[08:59:48] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[08:59:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd .filter() or .map() things out instead.
[09:00:48] <Jeroen2> Oh sorry it's angular :p
[09:00:56] <robertmaxrees> it's still JS
[09:02:12] <Jeroen2> Nvgm got it ;)
[09:02:22] <Jeroen2> {{ modus[0].values[0].value }}
[09:02:30] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() :(
[09:02:46] <Jeroen2> filter?
[09:02:49] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[09:02:50] <Jeroen2> But I still should get
[09:02:57] <robertmaxrees> using array indexes is weak.
[09:03:05] <Jeroen2> if it's 21, 22, 23 for example it should show: Mode: 21, 22, 23
[09:03:09] <Jeroen2> now it only shows the 0 value (21).
[09:03:25] <robertmaxrees> mind showing a more fleshed out example of your data?
[09:04:35] <Jeroen2> I'll check it out later. Having dinner right now. Thanks for your help anyway.
[09:04:44] <Jeroen2> Will make a loop or something to get my data. :-)
[09:04:47] <robertmaxrees> check out the native javascript .map() method.
[09:04:50] <robertmaxrees> don't use loops.
[09:04:53] <robertmaxrees> loops are gross.
[09:05:01] <Jeroen2> a filter?
[09:05:04] <Jeroen2> I'll search for that.
[09:05:08] <robertmaxrees> .filter() and .map()
[09:05:15] <robertmaxrees> the latter is really what you want.
[09:05:46] <mynameisbrian> loops are not gross
[09:05:47] <Jeroen2> Thanks. :-)
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> mynameisbrian sure they are - they're prescriptive instead of descriptive.
[09:06:05] <robertmaxrees> they're often use for the wrong reasons.
[09:06:08] <robertmaxrees> *used
[09:28:01] <dimi1947> how I can remove a property from an object?
[09:28:15] <robertmaxrees> delete Object.property
[09:29:14] <dimi1947> is there a delete keyword?
[09:29:24] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete
[09:30:06] <dimi1947> oh....I made the mistake of advising the w3schools tutorials....
[09:30:11] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[09:30:57] <dimi1947> what we means robertmaxrees
[09:31:02] <dimi1947> ew.
[09:31:06] <dimi1947> I meant
[09:31:09] <robertmaxrees> w3schools is terrible.
[09:31:27] <dugler> how do I fix decimal after two characters from right? http://jsfiddle.net/wsjcvoLj/ eg: if  I enter '1' it should be displayed as '0.01' if I enter 11 it should be displayed as 0.11 if I enter 111 it should be displayed as 1.11 and so on...
[09:31:32] <dimi1947> I agree...it is a bad habbit I have to cut
[09:31:50] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you shouldn't generally be deleting out of objects in the first place :)
[09:32:13] <robertmaxrees> dugler is this for currency input?
[09:32:22] <dugler> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:33:25] <dimi1947> why...?
[09:33:30] <dimi1947> sometimes is needed
[09:33:38] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to delete data?
[09:33:56] <robertmaxrees> mutability leads to logs of avoidable bugs imo.

[09:43:53] <ashemark> Hi!
[09:44:14] <robertmaxrees> hellow
[09:45:09] <ashemark> I'm making an ajax request to a rest api running on localhost via a webpage, but the post request is ending up on the same page...
[09:46:05] <ashemark> viz. I'm at localhost:3000/home.html and I make a request to http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint from the html page, but it posts to /home.html only
[09:46:13] <ashemark> am I missing anything?
[09:46:18] <robertmaxrees> show your JS
[09:47:37] <ashemark> ok
[09:50:21] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/NifNZZ41
[09:52:27] <NoiseEee> ashemark: what makes you think its posting to "home.html"
[09:52:39] <ashemark> NoiseEee: Chrome developer tools
[09:52:46] <ashemark> console to be specific
[09:53:53] <NoiseEee> well nothing in that code pasted indicates that should be happening
[09:53:59] <ashemark> :(
[09:54:40] <ashemark> I'm adding that form dynamically to the page, using $('#page-wrapper').replaceWith(formHtml);
[09:54:49] <robertmaxrees> ah-hah
[09:55:02] <robertmaxrees> is this bound before or after that replcement?
[09:55:04] <robertmaxrees> *replacement
[09:55:18] <NoiseEee> do you even see "reached!" in your console then?
[09:55:34] <ashemark> NoiseEee: haven't seen it
[09:55:38] <ashemark> lemme try again
[09:55:46] <robertmaxrees> ashemark right - you're bidning before it exists.
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[09:55:52] <NoiseEee> i'm betting your don't, and as robertmaxrees is hinting, oh there ^^
[09:56:23] <ashemark> i was using $('#page-wrapper').on('click', '#button_id', function(event) .. with the same results
[09:57:26] <ashemark> it was $('#new_form').on('click','#button_id', function(event) ....     NoiseEee, robertmaxrees
[09:57:38] <ashemark> is that what you're referring to?
[09:58:27] <arc_> i don't know if replaceWith will actually remove the node from dom and create a new node in its place. seems like it would
[09:58:36] <dmsjx> If I have 2 variables (x1 and cn) set.  The first jquery code works fine and loads properly, the second version fails to load. Whats the syntax problem here?  $('#dydata').load("blocks/form-quote.php?num=" + x1);  $('#dydata').load("blocks/form-quote.php?num=" + x1 + "&cn=" + cn);
[09:58:42] <arc_> in that case, binding the event to #page-wrapper, it seems like it would be destroyed when you replaceWith
[09:59:05] <arc_> can you keep the div and use .html to replace the div's contents instead?
[09:59:08] <robertmaxrees> ashemark is #new_form aparty of the stuff getting replaced?
[09:59:11] <NoiseEee> ashemark: unless #new_form exists at page load, its submit handler wont be invoked the way you have it now
[09:59:40] <robertmaxrees> even if #new_form exists on pageload, if it's apart of the data that gets replaced, that binding will "die
[09:59:41] <robertmaxrees> "
[09:59:54] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: so what do you suggest?
[09:59:58] <robertmaxrees> bind higher.
[10:00:09] <robertmaxrees> bind to the parent of the element you're replacing.
[10:00:24] <dmsjx> anybody?
[10:00:35] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: the onclick delegation?
[10:00:42] <robertmaxrees> ashemark yes.
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> dmsjx "doesn't work" isn't helpful.
[10:00:55] <robertmaxrees> what doesn't work?
[10:01:24] <robertmaxrees> dmsjx have you looked at your network tab?
[10:01:31] <dmsjx> the second version where 2 variables are passed fails to load the page - there are no errors thrown in the console. so i have no "error" to show?
[10:01:43] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: would it be helpful if I bind the delegation something that stays in the dom all the time?
[10:01:45] <robertmaxrees> dmsjx look at your network tab.
[10:01:48] <dugler> why onchange method is not running http://jsfiddle.net/wsjcvoLj/3/ ?
[10:01:52] <ashemark> i mean, before and after the replace?
[10:02:07] <dugler> it says "Uncaught ReferenceError: setTwoNumberDecimal is not defined"
[10:02:09] <robertmaxrees> ashemark it needs to be bound ot something that never gets rteplaced at all, yes.
[10:02:18] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: okay, gotcha
[10:02:29] <robertmaxrees> dugler don't use inline event bindings.
[10:02:55] <dugler> robertmaxrees: how do I do this?
[10:03:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're using vanilla JS, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
[10:03:32] <dmsjx> @robertmaxrees ok, give me a min
[10:04:02] <robertmaxrees> dugler http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wsjcvoLj/4/
[10:06:09] <dugler> robertmaxrees: thanks, Infact I am needing to use in  backbone.js, I am calling change method as backbone.js supports but it is not being called :s
[10:06:25] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: worked, thanks!!! NoiseEee, arc_
[10:06:54] <robertmaxrees> dugler you need to use the events property.
[10:08:41] <dugler> robertmaxrees: so I am using like http://pastebin.com/NJFpHrMH method on line 2 is being called (it is applied on a selection box) but method on line 3 is not being called it I am applying on a input box
[10:09:06] <robertmaxrees> dugler you set an element in the view, right?
[10:09:10] <NoiseEee> np ashemark good luck
[10:09:27] <ashemark> NoiseEee: :D
[10:09:41] <Jeroen2> COuld someone explain me how to use .map or .filter on the modus I just told about?
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 share a fiddle :)
[10:10:01] <robertmaxrees> show your work ;)
[10:10:17] <dmsjx> @robertmaxrees well, it seems only part of a variable is being sent, i assume that the SPACE inbetween the firstname lastname the composes the CN variable is the problem. Ok, thanks for that Network suggestion i can work around the problem from here
[10:10:35] <dugler> robertmaxrees: yes html looks like http://pastebin.com/ELR8a3yc
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> dugler that's not what i mean.
[10:10:56] <Jeroen2> I just got the var modus that gives this value: [{"values":[{"value":"34"}]."count":"1"}]
[10:11:02] <robertmaxrees> dugler when you initialize the view, you need to supply an element.
[10:11:26] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 earlier you mentioned something about more data - could you supply a more fleshed out example?
[10:11:30] <robertmaxrees> in jsfiddle.
[10:11:35] <Jeroen2> Can't :p
[10:11:43] <Jeroen2> ehmm
[10:11:47] <Jeroen2> can "fake" it.
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> that's all we need.
[10:12:18] <Jeroen2> [{"values":[{"value":"34", "value":22", "value":"33"}]."count":"3"}]
[10:12:20] <Jeroen2> I think it will be that ^
[10:12:29] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what all do you want out of that?
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> the values?
[10:12:44] <Jeroen2> I do want 34, 22, 33
[10:12:53] <robertmaxrees> heh, okay.
[10:12:55] <Jeroen2> seperated by a ","
[10:12:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid JSON.
[10:13:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wde0L92t/
[10:13:26] <robertmaxrees> like this?
[10:13:33] <dugler> robertmaxrees:  I think answer to your question is "Yes"
[10:13:41] <dugler> it is supplied
[10:13:46] <Jeroen2> not sure let me check if I can get 2 players in.
[10:13:47] <Jeroen2> one second
[10:14:06] <robertmaxrees> dugler then it should work.  head over to #documentcloud if you have more issues with backbobne,
[10:15:39] <Jeroen2> Oh no I was wrong.
[10:15:39] <dugler> thank you robertmaxrees for the correct channel
[10:15:40] <Jeroen2> [{"values":[{"value":"8"},{"value":"13"}],"count":1"}]
[10:16:30] <robertmaxrees> so like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wde0L92t/2/
[10:17:21] <Jeroen2> Yes
[10:17:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wde0L92t/3/
[10:17:52] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea.
[10:44:38] <dimi1947> sometimes is just so hard finding a solution to a problem cause the code is so much that I cannot just copy it in jsfiddle or elsehwere
[10:44:56] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what's the current thing you're looking at?
[10:45:05] <robertmaxrees> usually that's an example of not paring things down enough.
[10:47:19] <dimi1947> I am trying to iterate through an object with a for/in loop and while it works in jsfiddle it does not work locally...
[10:47:32] <robertmaxrees> you should avoid iterating through objects generally anyway,
[10:47:45] <robertmaxrees> use arrays and forEach() if you need to do that.
[10:48:04] <dimi1947> yes in my case...it is an object though
[10:48:27] <robertmaxrees> anything in your console?
[10:48:36] <Jeroen2> Thanks robertmaxrees. ;)
[10:48:45] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 that get you started on the right path?
[10:49:18] <Jeroen2> Yeah ;)
[10:49:21] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[10:50:04] <dimi1947> just tell me this...is this code valid    for (x in days) {
[10:50:04] <dimi1947>               console.log(days[x].open_a);
[10:50:04] <dimi1947>                 if(days[x].open_a!==null)
[10:50:04] <dimi1947>                    {console.log('hi');
[10:50:04] <dimi1947>             }
[10:50:13] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 please don't paste in the channel like that.
[10:50:31] <robertmaxrees> and no, so far that's not valid.
[10:51:04] <dimi1947> ok....
[10:51:08] <dimi1947> sorry
[10:51:21] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/61/
[10:51:43] <dimi1947> type there the valid code of the above
[10:51:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:52:00] <dimi1947> what is the matter?
[10:52:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're working through?
[10:52:23] <robertmaxrees> linkling me to a full backbone view and then telling me to put in more code doesn't really help.
[10:52:45] <dimi1947> lines 41-48...I am trying to iterate thorugh an object....
[10:52:55] <dimi1947> is the code OK?
[10:53:15] <robertmaxrees> that'
[10:53:21] <robertmaxrees> *that's going to cause you all kinds of bugs.
[10:54:53] <dimi1947> why?
[10:55:15] <robertmaxrees> for (x in test) { creates a global "x" variable, and this doesn't account for the prototype chain at all.
[10:55:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wc0xk25g/1/
[10:55:24] <robertmaxrees> try something like this instead.
[10:55:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not ideal, but you don't want to use an array here for whatever reason.
[10:57:09] <dimi1947> give a min I want to make some testing
[10:59:06] <dimi1947> ok...how am i going to test that open_a is not null?
[10:59:31] <dimi1947> there is one such instance there
[11:00:04] <robertmaxrees> my first question is why you're supplying "null" as a value in the first place.
[11:00:52] <dimi1947> that goes to the database where a table holds schedulling info....null meand closed day...the store is closed
[11:01:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd transform that data before shipping it to your frontend.
[11:01:15] <robertmaxrees> but oaky.
[11:01:17] <robertmaxrees> *okay
[11:01:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wc0xk25g/3/
[11:02:08] <robertmaxrees> null, undefined, '' (empty string), 0 (the number), false... these are all "falsy" values.
[11:02:17] <robertmaxrees> so you can just do if (currentDay.open_a) {} and you're good to go.
[11:03:06] <dimi1947> thanks...from this point madness starts...
[11:03:18] <dimi1947> I will have to test the code locally
[11:03:29] <robertmaxrees> your data isn't really structured in a sensible way, so that's going to cause some of your headaches.
[11:04:09] <dimi1947> what data....placing null values?is that what you mean?
[11:04:29] <robertmaxrees> the structure of it overall.
[11:05:06] <dimi1947> you have to be more specfic....the only thing I have shown to you is just an object...nothing else
[11:05:21] <robertmaxrees> use an array instead of that object.
[11:05:30] <robertmaxrees> and provide more context to each object in that array.
[11:06:42] <dimi1947> just give me some min to test
[11:07:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wc0xk25g/4/
[11:07:15] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[11:08:50] <dugler> how do I set value of a input field using jquery? tried .text() and .html() none of them is working
[11:09:00] <robertmaxrees> .val()
[11:09:01] <dugler> tried like this.$('.paymentline-input').text(9.00);
[11:10:21] <dimi1947> I cannot believe it....your code worked...
[11:10:55] <dimi1947> with the for loop I could not make it work
[11:11:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 for loops are gross anyway
[11:11:22] <dimi1947> but why...they are contained in the docs
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> "they are contained in the docs"?
[11:11:55] <robertmaxrees> just because something exists as a feature doesn't mean it's a good idea to use it.
[11:11:56] <dugler> thank you again robertmaxrees
[11:12:02] <dugler> :)
[11:12:15] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[11:13:08] <dugler> robertmaxrees: is there a way to remove decimal from a number in .js or should use regular expression? eg: 1.23 should give 123
[11:13:23] <dimi1947> I mean w3scools mentiones them
[11:13:31] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 w3schools is a terrible site.
[11:13:33] <robertmaxrees> don't use it.
[11:13:42] <robertmaxrees> dugler use a regex, depending.
[11:13:57] <CharlesAtum> Hi, I'm having some issues with a form I'm loading in a page with load()
[11:14:15] <CharlesAtum> It has a save and a cancel button, but clicking them never works
[11:14:31] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum what sorts of problems?  do you have any code you can share in a fiddle?
[11:14:51] <CharlesAtum> Hold on, I will paste some of these files
[11:14:51] <dugler> fine thanks, robertmaxrees
[11:15:00] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum errr.
[11:15:06] <arc_> what's wrong with for loops, and do you mean just in javascript or in everything
[11:15:18] <robertmaxrees> only need to see the relevant bits of js.
[11:15:27] <robertmaxrees> arc_ loops are prescriptive instead of descriptive.
[11:16:04] <robertmaxrees> and I'm speaking to JS, though other languages often have functions/methods that enable you to be smarter about how you work with arrays.
[11:16:41] <CharlesAtum> Ok, so here is one of the forms and the form.js file
[11:16:44] <CharlesAtum> http://jsfiddle.net/m52d7xo9/
[11:17:13] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum so what's the specific issue you're having?
[11:18:03] <CharlesAtum> Well, the Salvar and Cancelar buttons don't work and I don't know why
[11:18:46] <robertmaxrees> do you happen to load in this form dynamically?
[11:19:25] <CharlesAtum> Yup, I load it in a div using load()
[11:19:32] <robertmaxrees> that's probably why.
[11:19:46] <robertmaxrees> usually you need to use event delegation in those cases.
[11:19:54] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:20:05] <CharlesAtum> I expected chnaging form .click to on('click') would work, but it didn't
[11:20:14] <CharlesAtum> *changing from
[11:20:46] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees,are you still there
[11:20:46] <dimi1947> ?
[11:20:48] <robertmaxrees> right, .on('click', ...) and .click(...) do the exact same thing - the latter is a convenience method for the former
[11:23:24] <dimi1947> I finally found the problem and most importantly i able to replicate it in jsfiddle...
[11:23:31] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[11:24:22] <dimi1947> just tell me please tell me why this code does not work...I modified the conditional and the object...just see it https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/a86qrLrz/2/
[11:24:40] <CharlesAtum> Okay, I think I got it
[11:24:53] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 it DOES work.
[11:24:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen?
[11:25:07] <CharlesAtum> The div the forms are loaded is #form_data
[11:25:38] <CharlesAtum> So $('#form_data').on('click', button_element, function() {};
[11:25:48] <CharlesAtum> Right, robertmaxrees?
[11:25:57] <dimi1947> I do not see anything in the console....open is supposed to be printed
[11:26:01] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum is #form_data apart of what gets loaded, then?
[11:26:18] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 right, if ((currentDay.open_a) && (currentDay.close_b)) { will only pass if both of those are truthy.
[11:26:19] <robertmaxrees> one is not.
[11:27:26] <dimi1947> but we have monday.open_a and tuesday close_b
[11:27:31] <CharlesAtum> robertmaxrees: What do you mean by "apart"?
[11:27:37] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 like are your data duder.
[11:27:40] <robertmaxrees> typo
[11:28:06] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum #form_data is selecting an element obviously - is that element added to the page after it loads?
[11:28:23] <dimi1947> I think i got where is the problem,,,,,
[11:28:39] <dimi1947> the loop checks each object per se
[11:28:44] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 no.
[11:28:51] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 look at the names of those properties.
[11:29:15] <CharlesAtum> robertmaxrees: That element is already in the page and is used by the load function to load the forms
[11:29:28] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum then yeah, you should be able to bind to that.
[11:29:41] <robertmaxrees> $('#form_data').on('click', 'button_element', function() {};
[11:29:47] <dimi1947> they are wrong....
[11:30:06] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you have close_a in one case and close_b in another.
[11:31:02] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/a86qrLrz/7/  just tell me if this correct
[11:31:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:31:15] <robertmaxrees> i already told you why your code doesn't work.
[11:31:42] <cardguy10> O
[11:32:58] <dimi1947> so you are trying to say that the conditional will work if the properties names are the same from object to object
[11:33:18] <CharlesAtum> It worked. Thanks, robertmaxrees.
[11:33:21] <cardguy10> I'm having an issue when using a plugin with jquery mobile.  It only works when on the first page.  http://jsfiddle.net/2kxrfkz2/1/ works as you see the three red slides horizontally.  Then when you look at this one where I've just moved the div "your-class" to the second page when you click on the second page it does not load.  http://jsfiddle.net/2kxrfkz2/2/
[11:33:28] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 ... you're checking the property names open_a and close_b.
[11:33:31] <robertmaxrees> never anything else.
[11:34:05] <robertmaxrees> so you'll never check any other property names.
[11:34:05] <dimi1947> "never anything else"?
[11:34:11] <robertmaxrees> if ((currentDay.open_a)&&(currentDay.close_b) ){
[11:34:17] <robertmaxrees> that only checks those two properties.
[11:34:28] <robertmaxrees> notice how you don't check close_a ?
[11:35:04] <dimi1947> and....
[11:35:19] <robertmaxrees> that's all there is to say.
[11:35:19] <dimi1947> ok we are checking these 2 properties
[11:35:25] <robertmaxrees> *you
[11:37:03] <dimi1947> I will study your words....and see things again
[11:37:18] <robertmaxrees> this is really basic dude
[11:42:20] <dimi1947> basic or not...I cannot understand it...yet
[11:42:34] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 look at your object.
[11:42:51] <robertmaxrees> notice how your object has open_a and close_a ?
[11:43:10] <robertmaxrees> for monday - then tuesday has open_a and close_b ?
[11:43:53] <dimi1947> i fixed that... https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/a86qrLrz/9/
[11:44:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:44:05] <robertmaxrees> that has the same probject.
[11:44:19] <robertmaxrees> except now tuesday is open_b and close_b
[11:44:27] <robertmaxrees> monday and tuesday should use the same property names.
[11:44:35] <robertmaxrees> not different ones.
[11:44:47] <dimi1947> oh
[11:45:11] <dimi1947> you mean the loop cannot work if the property names are different?
[11:45:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying first of all that your data makes no sense if you change those property names like that.
[11:46:03] <robertmaxrees> secondarily, it'll be really hard to make this forEach() setup work if you change them.
[11:46:38] <dimi1947> so you are saying that monday and tuesday and must have both open_a.close_a?
[11:46:46] <robertmaxrees> or just open and close
[11:46:51] <robertmaxrees> no need forthe _a bit.
[11:47:08] <dimi1947> ok then...here is my problem
[11:47:34] <dimi1947> for better or worse my object is like this....that is how it comes from the server
[11:47:41] <robertmaxrees> then you should fix your server.
[11:47:45] <robertmaxrees> because that's not a very good idea.
[11:48:46] <dimi1947> that is considerable work....and I do not know if I want to do this now...
[11:49:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?  your schema sounds really bizarre.
[11:49:28] <dimi1947> I will have to find alternatives...maybe chunking the object into two arrays
[11:49:38] <robertmaxrees> you're going to make things worse.
[11:49:42] <robertmaxrees> fix your server-side.
[11:50:13] <dimi1947> I will see what I am going to do....fixing the server is last resort
[11:50:30] <robertmaxrees> that should be your first one.
[11:50:52] <robertmaxrees> don't make your frontend do more than it should - give it good data to start with.
[11:54:15] <spottieottie> hey im working through this book Javascript&Jquery the missing manual. and Im on this exercise using the function Parseint... on the paste bin im confused on step 9 where its throwing a 10 next to luckynumber, 10, Whats the purpose of using that 10
[11:54:22] <spottieottie> http://pastebin.com/TXPiNxLu
[11:54:47] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees,what time is there now..where do you leave?
[11:54:56] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt @spottieottie
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> spottieottie the radix - check out noisee's link.
[11:55:14] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i'm in california.
[11:55:17] <robertmaxrees> almost noon here.
[11:55:17] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:55:56] <dimi1947> athens...greece...10:00PM very tired....see you tommorow...going to sleep
[11:58:18] <spottieottie> so is the radix like a reference  system of baseline conversion to what type of number it is suppose to be?
[12:00:06] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand i'm back.
[12:04:16] <dugler> how do I select  input with class="paymentline-input" which is clild of class="paymentline selected" html is http://pastebin.com/ybJitpLp I am trying like $('.paymentline selected > .paymentline-input')
[12:04:38] <robertmaxrees> just $('.paymentline .paymentline-input')
[12:04:51] <dugler> robertmaxrees:  do we not need > symbol?
[12:05:05] <gtristan> Hi, I believe there is a sort of basic animation which shows an element by animating it's height, anyone can remind me what that was ?
[12:05:09] <robertmaxrees> dugler that's direct child - $('.paymentline > .paymentline-input')
[12:05:43] <spottieottie> robertmaxrees what if a radix of 27, or 24, or 22 is used. i kind of understand what 10 is doing,  but is there some sort of like chart specifying what other numbers between 2 - 36 are doing?
[12:05:56] <robertmaxrees> spottieottie check out the mdn article.
[12:06:28] <gtristan> slideUp() to hide and slideDown() to show I guess ?
[12:06:44] * gtristan is fed up messing with garbage unreliable CSS3 transitions
[12:06:53] * gtristan has to replace the garbage bootstrap collapse
[12:07:14] <robertmaxrees> gtristan those will basically do what you want, yeah.
[12:07:22] <gtristan> thanks :)
[12:08:17] <spottieottie> so radix means number of numbers used in the mathematical system.like a radix of 10 is 0-9?   what I dont get is a radix of say 4. how is that a system of itself?
[12:08:38] <robertmaxrees> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix spottieottie
[12:09:51] <dugler> robertmaxrees: $('.paymentline > .paymentline-input') not working well it selects all divs with class=" paymentline-input"
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> dugler make a fiddle with your html
[12:10:15] <skinux> What would be the right function for checking that phone number is is the format xxx-xxx-xxxx ?
[12:10:29] <robertmaxrees> skinux a regular expression
[12:10:47] <skinux> Okay. I don't know how to do RegEx in JS
[12:11:10] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[12:11:21] <robertmaxrees> can use .match() or .indexOf() - lots of choices.
[12:11:47] <NoiseEee> id consider making sure your number has 10 digits vs formatting, but hey thats me

[12:13:25] <dugler> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/e2nL07j7/1/  I want to read and update input from only selcted box which is child of  class "paymentline selected"
[12:14:49] <robertmaxrees> "selected box"?

[12:17:34] <dugler> robertmaxrees: exactly thanks
[12:25:16] <alaing> good evening
[12:25:36] <alaing> why so quiet in here?
[12:25:47] <alaing> this room used to buzz with questions
[12:26:04] <robertmaxrees> it goes through phases :)
[12:26:22] <alaing> obviously the quiet phase now :-P
[12:26:35] <Phase> :o
[12:26:53] <alaing> Phase: I wasn't talking about you lol
[12:26:58] <Phase> I know
[12:26:58] <Phase> lol
[12:27:21] <alaing> i want to do some dev work!!!
[12:29:47] <jani__> hello. I have this site url http://alturl.com/4em92 it has the issue of images loading. the thumbnails images under tour and travels text are loading in a very off maner. can anyone help me in this issue so that the images loads properly.
[12:30:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:30:26] <robertmaxrees> "in a very off manner"?  care to elaborate.
[12:33:18] <jani__> robertmaxrees. mean the images loading
[12:33:38] <jani__> if you look at that then that images are not loading in that good manner
[12:33:42] <robertmaxrees> jani__ right - i see the images.  what's the issue with them?  are you wondering how to style them correctly?
[12:46:52] <notchris> How day I do something for each TD in a table ?
[12:47:07] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing?
[12:47:07] <notchris> $.each('td',function(){}); did not work
[12:47:23] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each() for jquery objects.
[12:47:37] <notchris> I tried to do
[12:47:38] <bPQrst> how do you guys think about light-weight things that do exactly the same as jQuery like zepto?
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> $('td').each(function() {}); is closer to what you want.
[12:47:46] <notchris> $(‘td’).each({})
[12:47:54] <robertmaxrees> bPQrst they don't do the same thing, but they're neat.
[12:48:16] <arthurvr> bPQrst: I believe I sad that earlier in this channel, if you think both do ‘the same thing’ let’s run the unit tests and we’ll see :)
[12:48:27] <arthurvr> s/sad/said
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> notchris $('td').each(functiion() {}); is likely what you want.
[12:48:37] <notchris> AH
[12:48:40] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Thanks man!
[12:48:53] <robertmaxrees> notchris oftentimes you don't need each() though.
[12:49:05] <bPQrst> arthurvr: how many wouldn't pass? 5%? 3%?
[12:49:08] <bPQrst> or even less
[12:49:17] <robertmaxrees> bPQrst more for older browsers.
[12:49:33] <arthurvr> I more realistic estimate would be be above 50%.
[12:49:35] <arthurvr> at least.
[12:49:41] <arthurvr> Plus what robertmaxrees said
[12:50:23] <robertmaxrees> bPQrst are you trying to decide on zepto vs. jquery?
[12:50:35] <bPQrst> yup
[12:50:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery will handle more edge cases for you.
[12:51:48] <notchris> robertmaxrees: If I use $(‘td’).attr(‘class’) to get the classname
[12:51:55] <notchris> How do I only get the first class name?
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> notchris "first" is ephemeral.
[12:52:03] <notchris> If the TD has multiple classes
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> you can do .split(' ')[0]
[12:52:24] <robertmaxrees> but you can't necessarily guarantee the order.
[12:52:54] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Thank you
[12:53:17] <bPQrst> how big is the byte size impact?
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> bPQrst caching in the browser usually makes that a moot point :)
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> also: compress your images and serve them up at the right size.
[12:54:30] <arthurvr> well every byte you win is a potential bug or incompatibity. Also browser caching takes away much of it. It’s way more important to keep other resources slim and optimized.
[12:54:41] <arthurvr> and robertmaxrees said that already lol :p
[12:54:45] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> it's an apples to pears comparison.
[12:55:46] <robertmaxrees> bPQrst what browsers do you need to support?
[12:56:28] <arthurvr> it kinda sucks that people fall over the relatively little things like this by the way. More than 80% of the websites aren’t optimizing any other of their resources. You can win way more by using, for example, imagemin.
[12:56:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day.
[12:57:15] <bPQrst> IE10+
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> you could look at jquery 2.x if that's the case.
[12:58:23] <bPQrst> so you're thinking that I should use jQuery intead of zepto?
[12:58:28] <arthurvr> You’re in #jquery :)
[12:59:40] <arthurvr> Plus if you’re planning to use any jQuery plugins there’s a big chance those won’t be compatible anyways
[13:00:05] <bPQrst> I think I understood it. Thx
[13:00:15] <bPQrst> thanks robertmaxrees and arthurvr
[13:00:32] <bPQrst> you're both smart guys thus I will do as you say.
[13:00:59] <arthurvr> Never trust us, really :) Though on a more serious note, it depends on your use case but this are some arguments to consider.
[13:02:56] <bPQrst> arthurvr: robertmaxrees: can I ask what function are you having in your real life? Javascript developer I guess but what exactly?
[13:03:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm a senior front-end developer for the largest home improvement ecommerce company in the US.
[13:03:52] <arthurvr> And I’m mainly doing open source (yeoman, todomvc, jQuery and many node modules)
[13:04:03] <arthurvr> and some light freelancing here and there :)
[13:04:35] <bPQrst> awesome
[13:04:37] <bPQrst> thanks both
[13:07:51] <jani_> hello. I have this site url http://alturl.com/4em92 it has the issue of images loading. the thumbnails images under tour and travels text are loading in a very off maner. can anyone help me in this issue so that the images loads properly.
[13:08:15] <jani_> I mean that if you look at this url http://alturl.com/p5vom
[13:08:29] <robertmaxrees> jani_ i already tried to help you.  what exactly is the issue?
[13:08:29] <jani_> that images are loading properly but this url  http://alturl.com/4em92 images are not loading properly. I mean when we refresh the page and look at the thumbnail place then we don't see any thumbnail but the thumbnails are loading and showing after page refresh
[13:08:36] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for help with styling?
[13:08:47] <jani_> no..
[13:08:53] <jani_> with the loading time of images
[13:08:56] <robertmaxrees> can you makea jsfiddle?
[13:09:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm having a hard time understanding how this is a jquery problem.
[13:09:12] <jani_> I am sorry. but I am not using javascript yet
[13:09:22] <robertmaxrees> then i'd hit up #css instead :)
[13:09:30] <jani_> I just want if to fix this issue is possible in jquery
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> not the right tool for the job.
[13:10:04] <jani_> I think the images loading should relate to jquery/javscript not css
[13:10:06] <jani_> :)
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:10:17] <jani_> then
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> if you're not already using it, it's not related ;)
[13:10:59] <jani_> i want to use if fix with that
[13:11:19] <jani_> did you realy understnad what I mean ?
[13:12:40] <jani_> ?
[13:16:16] <robertmaxrees> jani_ i'm trying to tell you that you don't want to use javascript/jquery to do this
[13:16:22] <robertmaxrees> you should really use CSS to fix it.
[13:17:28] <jani_> robertmaxrees: can you have a look at this http://postimg.org/image/eqw0s6yw9/
[13:18:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:18:07] <robertmaxrees> and?
[13:18:13] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I set up this: http://rocketb.in/paste/NzYDBR
[13:18:24] <notchris> Wondering how to replace the names of “z”
[13:18:32] <robertmaxrees> "the names of 'z'"?
[13:18:34] <notchris> var z = $(this).data('status');
[13:18:46] <notchris> So the items have different data status
[13:18:56] <notchris> free and danger
[13:19:11] <notchris> I want to replace “free” with “Open” and “danger” with “Closed”
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> then use an if statement and set $(this).data() within the two branches
[13:19:56] <notchris> Ahh
[13:20:52] <jani_> any update regarding my issue ?
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> jani_... it sounds like you need to use CSS to fix your problem.
[13:21:52] <jani_> I am wounder as I didn't work like this before. that how to use css to set the images on loading.
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> jani_ what didn't work like that?
[13:22:56] <jani_> I am not sure that how that work
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> okay - try to explain the problem again.
[13:25:28] <jani_> the issue is that when refresh the page and the that page re-loading after page refresh is in process then thta thumbnails with associative title under thumbnail images are not showing and when the page loading finish then that shows.
[13:25:52] <jani_> I just want to fix that. that thumbnail should be shown even if the page is reloading
[13:25:57] <robertmaxrees> jani_ the issue is that the images don't show while the page reloads?
[13:26:04] <jani_> yup
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not something you can necessarily fix.
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> that's apart of how the browser works.
[13:26:19] <jani_> while in inspect element that images are coming
[13:27:17] <jani_> if you check the and undersntand the difference between these two links. http://shine9.us/wpp/test-page/  vs http://shine9.us/wpp/
[13:27:33] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that question means.
[13:28:52] <jani_> kindly open these links and you will see that http://shine9.us/wpp/ link images are loaded even before the page loading fiinish while http://shine9.us/wpp/test-page/ this link has shown images thumbnails when the page loading finish
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> the first one i see the images load normally.
[13:29:50] <robertmaxrees> oh you're griping about the layout.
[13:29:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's all CSS related.
[13:30:03] <robertmaxrees> as far as I can tell at least.
[13:30:15] <jani_> can you help me in that ?
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> head to #css
[13:30:31] <jani_> I think you understand my issue so if you can ?
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> there are plenty of people in #css who can probably assist you better?
[13:31:46] <jani_> can you not ?
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> i never said I couldn't, but it's far enough offtopic for the channel that i'd opt to go elsewhere for help :)
[13:35:21] <notchris> So http://rocketb.in/paste/gXEEDX
[13:35:27] <notchris> the console log works for each item
[13:35:33] <notchris> appending the list item, doesn’t work
[13:35:40] <notchris> Not sure why as the console log works fine
[13:35:51] <robertmaxrees> what doesn't work about it?
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> that also looks wrong to me.
[13:36:06] <notchris> It does not append the list items
[13:36:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it.
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle off it.
[13:36:44] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Fiddle was giving me issues with the get
[13:36:46] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://ctsciencecenter.org:3000/hours
[13:36:49] <notchris> That’s the live example
[13:36:51] <robertmaxrees> notchris fake the data.
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> take out the ajax
[13:38:08] <jani_> robertmaxrees: that would take too much time to explain that issue to any other that you already got
[13:38:30] <robertmaxrees> sorry then!  dunno what else to tell you jani_
[13:38:41] <jani_> okya. np
[13:38:45] <jani_> have a greate day
[13:42:18] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/populartruth/3kye89dz/
[13:42:22] <notchris> Works better on my meteor example
[13:42:35] <notchris> Now I cant see moment or the value for z
[13:42:36] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:42:47] <robertmaxrees> what's with the variable names?
[13:42:56] <notchris> x y z?
[13:42:59] <notchris> just testing
[13:42:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:43:08] <robertmaxrees> what are they SUPPOSED to be though?
[13:43:20] <notchris> x is supposed to be the classname of the td
[13:43:34] <notchris> y is the first class of the td, which is the day of the month
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't stash that in  a data attribute instead?
[13:43:57] <notchris> dayNum removes the sbc-day portion and leaves the number
[13:44:11] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I cant control the calendar I need to pull this from
[13:44:25] <robertmaxrees> and what is "z" supposed to be?
[13:44:38] <notchris> So, the second class each td has is the status
[13:44:44] <notchris> or sorry, the data attribute status
[13:44:56] <notchris> is “free” or “danger
[13:45:03] <robertmaxrees> why are you reading the data attribute twice?
[13:45:03] <notchris> aka “Open”, “Closed"
[13:45:24] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I suppose, I could make it a variable?
[13:45:31] <robertmaxrees> one sec let me show you what i mean.
[13:45:47] <notchris> var status = $(this).data(‘status’)
[13:45:57] <notchris> Then, if status =
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> but also an else if
[13:46:06] <notchris> Ah, I haven’t used those yet
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:46:29] <notchris> I used “else”
[13:46:34] <notchris> But I didnt understand “else if"
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kye89dz/1/
[13:46:39] <notchris> If you could just do a bunch of ifs
[13:46:51] <notchris> does else if mean the first if is false?
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:47:02] <robertmaxrees> else if will stop evaluating as soon as it finds a match.
[13:47:50] <notchris> Ahhhh
[13:47:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you end up evaluating a bunch of code you don't need to run :)
[13:48:05] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Ahhhh
[13:48:11] <notchris> This makes way more sense
[13:48:42] <notchris> I’m confused as to why the list items dont take on default list styling
[13:48:45] <notchris> Vertical, with bullets
[13:48:54] <notchris> As a random thought
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle, it's because it's not actually running.
[13:49:21] <notchris> Ahhh
[13:49:51] <notchris> I need to change “z” then
[13:49:51] <notchris> hmm
[13:49:56] <notchris> To the new variable names
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:50:00] <robertmaxrees> the .each() doesn't even work.
[13:50:07] <notchris> Huh?
[13:50:10] <christoph_> hey, it might be the same problem i posted a few days ago but is there a workaround ?
[13:50:11] <christoph_> http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/575/
[13:50:20] <robertmaxrees> notchris http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kye89dz/2/
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> open your console.  what do you notice?
[13:50:36] <arc_> whoa is that really the 575th iteration of that fiddle, or does that mean something else here
[13:50:43] <notchris> Nothing is logged
[13:50:50] <robertmaxrees> notchris bingo.
[13:51:18] <notchris> How though…there are plenty of td's
[13:51:48] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ ... that's working fine.
[13:52:00] <christoph_> the input ist not editable
[13:52:45] <robertmaxrees> oh notchris this isn't valid html.
[13:53:16] <notchris> How could it not be valid
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the <table> tag ;)
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kye89dz/3/
[13:53:49] <arc_> christoph_ cancel is supposed to select the element that you want to be able to interact with, yes?
[13:53:58] <arc_> input is not inside the selected div
[13:54:03] <notchris> Wow I needed to pull the parent?
[13:54:08] <notchris> It couldn’t just read tds in tbody?
[13:54:19] <christoph_> cancel should be the elemnt which will not react to a drag
[13:54:28] <arc_> yes, which you want to be the input field
[13:54:39] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ change the selector for cancel then.
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> notchris you need the table tag in your markup.
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, it works fine.
[13:55:17] <arc_> is input without a type valid?
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> defaults to text.
[13:56:27] <arc_> k
[13:56:32] <christoph_> mhh so i have to select every input / selectmenu .... ?
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ huh?
[13:56:54] <arc_> if you have multiple elements like this, you can assign a class to that input in a draggable element, and use input.class to select all of them
[13:56:56] <christoph_> i only want to prevent dragging on the cancel div
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ which you're doing in that fiddle.
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> you cannot drag that widget if you click+drag on the cancel div.
[13:57:29] <arc_> christoph_ do you want to prevent dragging on the text that says cancell, or on the input field
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> also: sounds like you'll have multiple draggables like this - you can't use an ID in that case.
[13:58:12] <christoph_> okay i will try to explain clearly
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ you want to prevent drag when the user clicks on the text input?
[13:58:41] <christoph_> no
[13:58:46] <Es0teric> anyone here know a really good paralax slider?
[13:59:25] <christoph_> i only want to prevent dragging for the cancel div
[13:59:35] <christoph_> that works fine
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ that's what your fiddle is doing.
[13:59:36] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Hmmm
[13:59:37] <notchris> http://rocketb.in/paste/n6aeg6
[13:59:40] <notchris> Still no luck
[13:59:41] <notchris> :/
[13:59:45] <arc_> Es0teric http://revolution.themepunch.com/parallax-scroll-slider/
[13:59:48] <christoph_> but the side effect is that it disables the input
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ huh? that has nothing to do with the cancel.
[14:00:22] <Es0teric> arc_ one that is free
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> notchris you're not getting console errors on your site?
[14:00:25] <slickdrick> hi guys, I am loading 2 jquery libraries onto a page on my wordpress site and it is causing issues with some plugin functions not being recognized, I want to use jquery.noconflict() to resolve this... Do I have to use it on each jquery library I load on the page and give them both alias's or will just one do???
[14:00:34] <arc_> nope, sry ;)
[14:00:36] <christoph_> mhh but if i do not use the cancel it works fine
[14:00:37] <notchris> robertmaxrees: None
[14:00:44] <notchris> It’s just showing the console log dates
[14:00:47] <notchris> Just not the list
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> slickdrick uh.. just use a single copy of jquery
[14:01:02] <notchris> Not the visible list, just the console list of dates
[14:01:29] <robertmaxrees> notchris do a console.log($('#days').length); before that if (dayOfMonth check.
[14:02:13] <christoph_> then i do not understand why the input is disabled :D
[14:02:19] <notchris> robertmaxrees: “1"
[14:02:24] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ because you need to cancel drag on the input.
[14:02:26] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://ctsciencecenter.org:3000/hours
[14:02:29] <arc_> yeah, i don't understand that either tbh
[14:02:44] <arc_> but you can drag it and use the input field, as long as you don't cancel anything
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> notchris now try console.log($('[id=days]').length);
[14:03:07] <christoph_> arc_, exactly
[14:03:10] <arc_> does cancel limit what is canceled only to the selected element?
[14:03:19] <arc_> even if something else wouldn't have been by default?
[14:03:21] <robertmaxrees> cancel makes it so you cna't drag it by that element.
[14:03:22] <notchris> robertmaxrees: “1"
[14:03:42] <robertmaxrees> notchris no clue then.
[14:03:46] <arc_> well, in this case it seems to also be making it so that the text field is not canceled
[14:03:58] <arc_> although it was without canceling anything
[14:04:10] <christoph_> jeah
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> the input field is "canceled" by default.
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> except not the way y'all are thinking.
[14:04:39] <arc_> so what if he just puts the input field inside the cancel div
[14:04:44] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[14:04:46] <paule32__> hello
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> it'll work just fine.
[14:04:54] <arc_> christoph_ does that work for you or no
[14:05:06] <paule32__> i have a strange problem:  http://codepad.org/OlGTsLcO
[14:05:06] <christoph_> arc_,  not  a good solution for my real problem because there are more input fields
[14:05:18] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:05:26] <paule32__> width/height will always 0
[14:05:28] <robertmaxrees> then select inputs for the cancel.
[14:05:34] <christoph_> a good solution would be if could restore the default chancel
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:05:45] <arc_> can you show us the difference between your test case and the actual problem in the fiddle
[14:06:36] <christoph_> there are a lot of input fields and selectmenus but should be okay to add every ui element to chancel
[14:07:00] <christoph_> but would be even nicer to restore default values
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> just wrap all those elements in a div or something like that.
[14:07:09] <robertmaxrees> that last sentence makes no sense.
[14:07:18] <arc_> robertmaxrees here http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/577/
[14:07:30] <arc_> one of those allows you to select the field and the other one doesn't
[14:07:34] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> repeating IDs is invalid.
[14:07:41] <arc_> do what
[14:07:46] <spottieottie> does anyone know of a github project/boostrap /plug-in that accomplishes what im trying to do here?
[14:07:48] <spottieottie> http://imgur.com/thm0YSo
[14:07:54] <christoph_> no way they are layouted and i can not cancel on the hole div because for example it should be possible to drag between inputs
[14:07:56] <arc_> sorry, the draggable id is irrelevant to this though
[14:08:00] <arc_> it's not used
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> still relevant.
[14:08:28] <arc_> ok, well here then
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> same with the cancel id.
[14:08:39] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/578/
[14:08:49] <arc_> the cancel id is only used once
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/579/
[14:09:43] <arc_> in 578, why can only one of those text fields be selected
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> because you're using a draggable widget.
[14:10:41] <arc_> okay ... but the only difference between them is that the div above the text field is canceled
[14:10:57] <robertmaxrees> vs the cancel being wrapped around the input.
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/580/ notice how the first one works the way it should?
[14:11:33] <arc_> yes
[14:11:46] <arc_> we came up with that a while ago, but he says that doesn't work for his case
[14:11:53] <christoph_> jeah but it is not a good solution if there are multiple inputs and it should be possible to drag between inputs
[14:12:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[14:12:17] <christoph_> but adding input, select, .... to chancel list is okay
[14:12:36] <christoph_> why ? it could be a requirement
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean you object to wrapping that div around the input?
[14:12:53] <arc_> yeah idk what that means either. i'm just curious why canceling the div above the input field is causing the input field to be uninteractive
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> arc_ that's not what's causing it.
[14:13:10] <arc_> do you know what is?
[14:13:22] <robertmaxrees> afaik that's default behavior.
[14:13:33] <arc_> shouldn't default behavior be what happens when nothing is canceled?
[14:13:40] <paule32__> arc_: https://jsfiddle.net/2ymqhxrL/
[14:13:55] <arc_> what is this now
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about draggables - afaik the entire element acts as a "handle"
[14:14:35] <arc_> well, it makes sense for the text field to be uninteractive when the whole containing div is draggable
[14:14:38] <arc_> but it's not
[14:14:51] <arc_> you can interact with it
[14:14:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm?  have an example?
[14:14:56] <arc_> yeah that's what i'm saying
[14:15:00] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/578/
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.  these both act like I'd expect them to.
[14:15:26] <arc_> the div without any cancel allows you to interact with the text input
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> the second one?  does not for me.
[14:16:42] <arc_> wait... maybe it was the id thing that caused the problem, just not in the way i was thinking
[14:16:53] <christoph_> ???
[14:17:09] <arc_> it drives me crazy when people use ids instead of classes -_-
[14:18:54] <christoph_> but i do not understand as arc_  told before default behaviour should the behaviour if nothing is called. but if i add another div to cancel list all other elements like input (which was ignored before) should be still ignored
[14:19:10] <arc_> it is
[14:19:21] <arc_> it had something to do with how you were selecting it, that i can't reproduce anymore
[14:19:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:20:27] <christoph_> http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/575/
[14:20:40] <christoph_> here is my first example
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> right.  that is functioning exactly as written.
[14:21:04] <christoph_> what ?? :D
[14:21:06] <robertmaxrees> also: for those keeping score - that's using jq 1.7.1 and jqui 1.8
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ so what's the issue with that exact fiddle?
[14:22:08] <christoph_> input is not part of the cancel list and it should be
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/583/
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> there's one fix for that.
[14:22:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/584/ here's another.
[14:23:24] <arc_> i think selecting the input is probably the way he'll want to go
[14:23:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:23:47] <christoph_> jeah the second solution is really bad
[14:23:50] <arc_> will it matter for inputs that are not part of the draggable elements if he selects all inputs on the page
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ no it's not.
[14:23:58] <robertmaxrees> it;s just a different solution.
[14:24:08] <robertmaxrees> it'd be smarter to use that with classes instead of that ID>
[14:24:31] <robertmaxrees> arc_ shouldn't matter, no.
[14:24:33] <christoph_> it is not a practical solution for me but anyway
[14:24:43] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ restructuring your markup isn't?
[14:24:52] <christoph_> the first solution does not have the default behaviour i expected and explaied
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> then you're not explaining something.
[14:25:05] <arc_> what is wrong with it?
[14:25:29] <christoph_> i expected if i add a div to chancel list every defualt ignoring would be still ignored
[14:25:32] <christoph_> and thats not true
[14:25:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:26:08] <christoph_> input was ignored before , than i add the cancel div and then input isnt ignored anymore
[14:26:21] <robertmaxrees> you realize you're using an ancient version of jquery ui, right?
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> have you tried using something more recent?
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/585/ is this what you're expecting?
[14:27:19] <xniz> oh oh :o ello
[14:27:22] <arc_> christoph_ it wasn't that adding the cancel div prevented the input field from being canceled
[14:27:26] <arc_> something else caused that
[14:28:26] <christoph_> what :D the link you send is the workaround i do not prefer
[14:28:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:28:47] <christoph_> i do not want to wrap the div around the input
[14:28:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MAEvS/585/ look here.
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> oh one sec.
[14:29:19] <andywww> I’m using handlebars compiled by grunt-contrib-handlebars with the following template
[14:29:21] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2142b4dc8d0f4de77094
[14:29:39] <andywww> but fo some reason it doesn’t seem to like the link
[14:29:53] <arc_> christoph_ i can't reproduce the input field being interactive inside a draggable element without canceling
[14:29:57] <arc_> i don't know how you did that
[14:29:59] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-cancel christoph_
[14:30:00] <andywww> in chrome, i’m getting: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: /rides/another-giro-d-italia
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> this is what you're complaining about - there's a default setting for that.
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> when you set your own cancel, you're overriding the default.
[14:31:11] <christoph_> jeah and i expected adding a div to chancel list != overriding the default
[14:31:24] <arc_> well it does
[14:32:01] <arc_> so ... can you just select the div that you want to be canceled and also select the input field
[14:32:10] <arc_> because that's essentially the same thing
[14:32:22] <christoph_> adding the defaults "input,textarea,button,select,option"
[14:32:25] <christoph_> is a good way
[14:32:30] <arc_> yes
[14:33:17] <robertmaxrees> sure.  you could also read the defaults and then add to that list and slap it on the end.
[14:35:48] <christoph_> yes
[14:38:14] <christoph_> wtf now draggable does not work :D whats going on :D
[14:38:58] <arc_> did you select the whole div
[14:43:34] <christoph_> no there was a version problem but no i am able to select selectmenu and inputs
[14:43:40] <christoph_> but can not type to input :D
[14:43:45] <christoph_> wired stuff is going on
[14:43:59] <juro> hi, I have a load function and it works fine for two (of three) urls but for one, content is not loaded (no error though) - how do I find out why the load function never finishes?
[14:44:13] <robertmaxrees> juro check out the .fail() callback
[14:45:20] <juro> robertmaxrees, how do I reference that? I cannot find anything on the doc - http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:45:34] <robertmaxrees> $.load().fail()
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a deferred callback.
[14:49:20] <juro> robertmaxrees - http://pastie.org/10230376 - "TypeError: $(...).load(...).fail is not a function"
[14:50:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm so used to using $.ajax()
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> .fail() should work there.
[14:51:45] <juro> I don't think so. $.ajax() returns a jqXHR, whereas $.load() returns a jQuery object ...
[14:52:15] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:53:20] <juro> .error() works
[14:53:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, error and success still work.
[14:53:49] <robertmaxrees> though load would give you the deferred instead.
[14:54:34] <juro> anyway, now the url loads, so all is good.
[14:54:44] <juro> robertmaxrees, thank you for your help!
[14:56:49] <hydraidm801> how do I find every $("#id_start_date_1") and add an HTML <label> before it?
[14:57:33] <zzaichik> .each() probably
[14:57:43] <RantingHuman> and .prepend()
[15:04:45] <tkdaj1> could anyone tell me why an $.ajax() call would show no network activity?
[15:05:51] <tkdaj1> I also have console.log() statements in the call backs for success, error, and .done()
[15:05:55] <tkdaj1> but I get nothing
[15:06:12] <RantingHuman> is the call inside a function
[15:06:52] <RantingHuman> if so, is the function being called
[15:07:14] <tkdaj1> it is inside an onclick, but that is being called
[15:07:24] <tkdaj1> I have console.log() right before the $.ajax line
[15:07:26] <tkdaj1> and it shows
[15:08:15] <tkdaj1> what is the best way to share a snippet in here?
[15:08:16] <RantingHuman> hmmm, weird
[15:08:18] <tkdaj1> I'll show you what I have
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle or fixee
[15:09:11] <tkdaj1> https://jsfiddle.net/t5aorr1n/
[15:09:27] <tkdaj1> it won't work since it is calling to an ASP.NET web API on my local machine, tyhough
[15:09:29] <tkdaj1> though
[15:09:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5aorr1n/1/
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you use .fal() ?
[15:10:38] <tkdaj1> still nothing in network tab of firefox
[15:10:41] <tkdaj1> and no console
[15:10:46] <tkdaj1> no log*
[15:11:41] <robertmaxrees> but you get "clicked" in your console?
[15:11:51] <tkdaj1> yeah
[15:11:52] <tkdaj1> and second
[15:11:59] <tkdaj1> I think i just figured out why it doesn't send
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:12:09] <tkdaj1> but you would think one of those other functions would be called...
[15:12:15] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[15:12:24] <tkdaj1> I just used the debugger built into firefox and it shows that file.files[0] is undefined...
[15:12:32] <robertmaxrees> that would cause your problem then.
[15:12:37] <robertmaxrees> the code's bombing out.
[15:12:37] <RantingHuman> heh.
[15:12:42] <tkdaj1> I don't understand why it would be undefined..?
[15:12:46] <tkdaj1> I have a file in the field
[15:12:53] <robertmaxrees> console.log(file)
[15:12:55] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's good.
[15:14:22] <tkdaj1> hmm
[15:14:26] <tkdaj1> //Object { 0: <input#fileupload>, length: 1, context: HTMLDocument → FileUploadTest, selector: "#fileupload" }
[15:14:27] <tkdaj1> <input type="file" name="fileUpload" id="fileupload">
[15:14:40] <tkdaj1> the first one is when I use a $("#...") selector
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:14:46] <tkdaj1> second is document.getElementByID
[15:14:47] <robertmaxrees> that's ajquery object.
[15:14:51] <robertmaxrees> not a DOM element.
[15:14:53] <robertmaxrees> there's a difference.
[15:14:56] <tkdaj1> yeah
[15:15:18] <tkdaj1> I think I got it
[15:15:20] <tkdaj1> thank you
[15:16:05] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[15:24:46] <tkdaj1> What are you supposed to use after you have selected an input file element in jquery to access the file itself?
[15:25:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the underlying DOM element - usually done by using [0]
[15:25:10] <zzaichik> psh, who are you calling a deffo, ya deffo.   haha  (thanks for the chuckle)
[15:25:19] <tkdaj1> so var file = $("#fileupload"); file[0]
[15:44:52] <Dr-007> i've now got a mouseover on an image container. so whenever i mouseover that, the whole image gets revealed inside its container. overlapping over the rest of my form. great. if i set padding on the image. will the mouseover also work on the padding its whitespace around the image container?
[15:45:19] <Dr-007> too lazy to test it. so i figured i'd just ask
[15:45:47] <robertmaxrees> that should be easy enough to test.
[15:45:56] <robertmaxrees> (that's what the rest of us would have to do ;) )
[15:55:39] <hydraidm801> how do I get the sibling before an object?
[15:57:49] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/prev/
[15:57:53] <kevireilly> hydraidm801: hmm assuming you mean a siblling before an element, the `prev` method https://api.jquery.com/prev/
[15:58:15] <hydraidm801> $(this).sibling().prev() ??
[15:58:44] <kevireilly> just prev
[15:59:11] <robertmaxrees> "Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector." :)
[16:03:16] <hydraidm801> I am trying to append to a form on ready but my elements won't append. Is there another state after ready?
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:05:47] <robertmaxrees> it should work fine.
[16:05:55] <zzaichik> hydraidm801: maybe whip up a fiddle.
[16:05:59] <zzaichik> jsfiddle
[16:06:21] <zzaichik> at jsfiddle.net
[16:07:03] <hydraidm801> its in django don't think I could recreate the dom creation in a fiddle
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> you realize you can copy the html, right?
[16:07:48] <zzaichik> html is so cool like that.
[16:08:02] <hydraidm801> well postgres isn't
[16:08:09] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> we just need a simplified example.
[16:08:19] <robertmaxrees> that's all.,
[16:08:21] <robertmaxrees> not the entire page.
[16:09:23] <zzaichik> aye. a form with a couple elements. then throw that little snippet of js in the js window and …load dependancies etc and run that shit. then we can see what could possibly be breaking.
[16:46:23] <gnarf> $(this).prev() should be find, sibling() gets all sibling's then prev would get the previous element from each
[16:46:35] <gnarf> s/find/fine
[17:06:00] <teraquendya> hey, is there any way to see what methods are bound to a deferred/promise? or at least how many?
[18:22:37] <kevireilly_> gnarf: have a moment for a question regarding your requestAnimationFrame work?
[18:23:13] <gnarf> kevireilly_: sup
[18:23:38] <drej> gnarf: have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour, ReactJS ?
[18:23:50] <gnarf> 👎
[18:24:03] <drej> but, you have not been saved yet, my jquery child
[18:24:24] <kevireilly_> gnarf: on a system without native support, do you think a shim is potentially still more performant than an implementation that doesn’t utilize rAF?
[18:25:01] <gnarf> kevireilly: no, which is why the plugin only polyfills it... so you can just use it and get the benefits if it's supported
[18:25:42] <gnarf> but you only need the polyfill bits if you use requestAnimationFrame() other places
[18:25:49] <kevireilly_> gnarf: gotcha, thanks for the insight
[18:26:34] <gnarf> there isn't really any perf gain from the raf polyfill, it just gives you requestAnimationFrame(fn) which you expect to exist
[18:26:58] <kevireilly_> makes sense indeed
[18:27:13] <kevireilly_> I think most of my use cases won’t support it, so it may not be worth implementing
[18:27:28] <gnarf> kevireilly_: thats a shame, rAF is pretty well supported now
[18:27:53] <gnarf> `caniuse requestAnimationFrame
[18:27:54] <b-ot> gnarf: You can use requestAnimationFrame with: Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 4, Chrome 10, Safari 6, and iOS Safari 6. http://caniuse.com/#search=requestanimationframe
[18:28:41] <kevireilly_> yup :( it makes me sad face, but great thing to be aware of in general
[18:29:06] <kevireilly_> gnarf: curious if you can think of anything else that might help rendering performance outside of preventing reflows/repaints to the best of your ability
[18:29:30] <gnarf> kevireilly_: raw # of elements, but reflows/paints are pretty expensive
[18:30:02] <gnarf> kevireilly_: check out http://www.paulirish.com/2015/advanced-performance-audits-with-devtools/
[18:30:03] <kevireilly_> makes sense since a reflow needs to potentially evaluate all elements on the page
[18:31:21] <kevireilly_> modern devtools is also a missing part of the puzzle :)
[18:38:11] <Es0teric> can anyone let me know how to remove the last <li> node on this: http://pastebin.com/xDsGAXYu
[18:38:12] <Es0teric> ?
[18:39:13] <doug00>  /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER doug00 faxjdqioabdp
[18:42:49] <doug00> lol oops
[18:43:13] <doug00> ya let's put the command line where people say stuff :P
[18:44:50] <kevireilly_> doug00: most irc clients have a separate area for irc connection information where you should be able to perform the same commands
[18:45:03] <Es0teric> infact actually
[18:45:07] <Es0teric> how do i make this prepend/append once?
[18:45:20] <Es0teric> while at the same time removing the li that i just prepended?
[18:45:57] <kevireilly_> Es0teric: use/set/evaluate a boolean
[18:46:14] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ how would i apply that to this: http://pastebin.com/xDsGAXYu ?
[18:48:59] <kevireilly_> Es0teric: something like http://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/
[18:49:28] <kevireilly_> woops http://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/1/
[18:52:49] <kevireilly_> Es0teric: just in case you’re playing with the first example which declared the state variable in the wrong scope, check out the second link
[18:53:02] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ yeah i got it, thanks!
[18:53:05] <Es0teric> i am going to try it out
[18:53:13] <kevireilly_> alrightie
[18:53:43] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ so on the else i make added false
[18:53:44] <Es0teric> right?
[18:53:49] <Es0teric> just so it can start the cycle again
[18:53:58] <kevireilly_> ah you said once, but sure
[18:54:09] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ yeah but i figured since i am making it true
[18:54:16] <Es0teric> once it scrolls down it will stay true
[18:54:30] <Es0teric> well, kevireilly_ theoretically speaking lol
[18:54:38] <kevireilly_> true which handles the once part, but yeah maybe you want to remove it in the else or something
[18:55:25] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ right but what about removing the actual li node itself?
[18:55:50] <Es0teric> i mean thats what i am trying to remove too
[18:56:09] <Es0teric> i can simply just do $('.nav').find('.pull-left').remove(); ?
[18:57:29] <kevireilly_> Es0teric: I’d probably do something like http://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/2/
[18:58:10] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ ok that would remove all #pull-left on the page
[18:58:25] <Es0teric> wait ohh
[18:58:26] <Es0teric> i get it now
[18:59:26] <kevireilly_> Es0teric: I figured you needed the class for something due to multiple being on the page, but if not, remove the class
[19:00:11] <kevireilly_> and actually just realized might as well var $window = $(window) or something also to cache that result
[19:01:06] <kevireilly_> or $(this) within the scroll
[19:01:52] <kevireilly_> actually, scrollTop might already be a property somewhere inside $(this) or there might be an event being passed to the callback with it.. just cant recall offhand
[19:03:03] <Es0teric> kevireilly_ i see
[19:12:22] <DarkGhost> hey guys
[19:12:30] <DarkGhost> you guys want to check out my website and tell me why the animation is a bit weird?
[19:14:28] <notchris> g’evening
[19:16:41] <DarkGhost> gevening
[19:20:07] <kevireilly> DarkGhost: possibly
[19:20:28] <DarkGhost> http://bmax.io/dev/
[19:22:26] <arc_> a bit weird? it's hard to know what you want this to do that it isn't doing
[19:28:01] <DarkGhost> haha arc_  yeah I don't know
[19:28:07] <DarkGhost> but like you can't hover over it when it's done sometimes
[19:28:15] <DarkGhost> i think it's due to width and it's already technically "Hovered" idk
[19:29:36] <arc_> btw, if you click and drag on the social icons, you can move that div over so the text labels are showing where the icons should be
[19:29:52] <arc_> and yeah, i wasn't able to get it to hover at all for a while
[19:29:54] <arc_> i wasn't sure what i was missing
[19:31:01] <arc_> ok, it doesn't activate the hover until the cursor leaves the window for some reason
[19:31:28] <DarkGhost> arc_ yeah, how do I fix that
[19:31:31] <DarkGhost> and what d oyou mean click and drag social icon
[19:32:07] <arc_> i guess it doesn't matter, because that problem only manifests before the hover starts working
[19:32:14] <arc_> so if you fix that, it won't happen anymore
[19:32:35] <DarkGhost> ah.. yeah, how do I fi that though haha I don't know how
[19:32:37] <DarkGhost> I tried chaning width but idk
[19:33:04] <arc_> what are you using to do this hover
[19:33:21] <DarkGhost> jquery
[19:34:03] <arc_> i see, it's in the html
[19:34:39] <DarkGhost> yeah
[19:34:57] <DarkGhost> i tried using css transitions but I want the hover to work if you hover on one css, it expands both
[19:39:24] <arc_> yeah sorry i have no idea why that is happening
[19:39:42] <DarkGhost> haha ok forsure
[19:39:45] <DarkGhost> me neither
[19:39:58] <arc_> that is definitely exactly what is happening though. it doesn't fire until the mouse leaves the window
[19:40:39] <DarkGhost> i think its the set time out
[19:41:42] <arc_> well, if you remove that, what happens
[19:42:04] <DarkGhost> it works, but, it allowes you to hover while it's still in transition
[19:42:58] <arc_> there is some keyword i'm trying to remember
[19:44:16] <arc_> there is a way to properly wait for the transition to complete before allowing other transitions
[19:44:23] <arc_> but i forgot what it is
[19:44:27] <arc_> i don't do that type of stuff, so
[19:45:39] <DarkGhost> blah
[19:45:41] <DarkGhost> well thnak you.
[19:47:10] <arc_> if you do the initial transition with jquery, you can use the complete argument to set a flag
[19:47:18] <arc_> and then use an if statement to allow the other animation to play
[19:47:36] <Es0teric> ok so i have this problem here with scrolling.. the image keeps getting appended https://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/5/embedded/result/
[19:47:51] <Es0teric> on scroll
[19:47:53] <arc_> then you're not just waiting x amount of time, you're actually setting the order of steps
[19:48:37] <arc_> and btw, i recommend adding an opacity transition to the initial transition as well
[19:48:55] <arc_> and probably shortening the amount of distance it has to travel
[19:50:36] <Es0teric> anyone?
[19:51:33] <Es0teric> what about you arc_  ?
[19:52:36] <DarkGhost> hey arc_  how's that work now?
[19:53:37] <arc_> DarkGhost i'm sorry?
[19:53:41] <arc_> did you update the site?
[19:53:42] <DarkGhost> www.bmax.io/dev
[19:53:43] <DarkGhost> yeah
[19:53:54] <arc_> it seems to work
[19:54:02] <DarkGhost> awesome
[19:54:47] <arc_> except the initial animation is weird now, but i assume that is a result of just quickly converting it from a css animation to jquery
[19:55:23] <arc_> if that's what you did
[19:55:30] <DarkGhost> no... idk wtf is happening haha
[19:56:06] <arc_> it starts the transition the same as it did before, but after a second it suddenly warps to the end
[19:56:20] <arc_> oh that happens when my mouse cursor is in the hover zone
[19:56:31] <arc_> so now it's allowing me to hover while the animation is playing
[19:56:49] <arc_> your code is confusingly laid out so it's hard for me to read what is happening
[19:57:13] <arc_> you didn't use an if statement as far as i can tell
[19:57:28] <arc_> so you set the flag but you didn't use it
[19:58:13] <arc_> so now you just need to do if (flag) { ... } aroundthe whole hover animation section
[19:59:43] <Arcarc> Well this is awkward
[19:59:51] <arc_> lol -_-
[20:00:31] <arc_> Es0teric i'm sorry i have no idea what this is
[20:00:56] <Es0teric> arc_ as you can see there are a bunch of images that append to the navigation when you scroll down
[20:01:08] <arc_> no it doesn't
[20:01:24] <arc_> nothing happens here
[20:01:28] <Es0teric> arc_ so if you scroll up and down
[20:01:32] <Es0teric> you dont see broken images?
[20:01:34] <arc_> correct
[20:01:47] <Es0teric> you you see them or dont see them?
[20:01:58] <arc_> i do not see them
[20:02:18] <Es0teric> arc_ this is what i see: http://puu.sh/ihOCn/b6b97cd3e9.png
[20:02:24] <arc_> i see nothing happening in the html either
[20:03:17] <Es0teric> arc_ my point being is that i am trying to get something to prepend on scroll down then remove it when a scroll up event happens
[20:03:18] <arc_> DarkGhost did you see what i said?
[20:03:36] <arc_> Es0teric so you want it to happen once
[20:03:44] <Es0teric> arc_ right
[20:07:45] <arc_> yeah i can't make this do anything
[20:11:36] <DarkGhost> oh haha arc_
[20:11:39] <DarkGhost> jsut saw that, thank you.
[20:11:40] <DarkGhost> let me try that
[20:12:08] <DarkGhost> yeah, this was a mess.
[20:13:10] <DarkGhost> arc_ hows scoping work for that flag variable in jquery
[20:13:17] <DarkGhost> can I jsut set var outside of that function(E) { adn then do flag = true?
[20:13:20] <DarkGhost> ( i don't think so )
[20:13:36] <arc_> should be able to, try it
[20:16:57] <arc_> Es0teric you are selecting multiple elements with nav
[20:17:04] <arc_> also your html isn't vali
[20:17:04] <arc_> d
[20:17:15] <arc_> $('.nav')
[20:17:18] <arc_> multiple elements have this class
[20:17:39] <arc_> is that what you want?
[20:20:21] <DarkGhost> yeah arc_  doesn't seem to work
[20:20:24] <DarkGhost> flag always sees to be false
[20:22:34] <arc_> where are you testing that
[20:22:52] <arc_> i see no if statement on the code on your site
[20:24:17] <DarkGhost> loal dev
[20:24:21] <DarkGhost> only upload when necessary..
[20:24:28] <DarkGhost> I should technically just be able to put that hover code inside that function right
[20:24:29] <DarkGhost> same ffect?
[20:27:15] <arc_> i guess. then you wouldn't need the flag at all
[20:31:16] <DarkGhost> it's not working in side there either tho lol
[20:31:17] <DarkGhost> blah
[20:31:23] <Es0teric> arc_
[20:31:27] <arc_> yes
[20:31:28] <Es0teric> i have one element
[20:31:36] <Es0teric> i just want to select one element
[20:31:38] <arc_> there are two elements with class nav though
[20:31:40] <DarkGhost> unless I go off screen like previously..
[20:31:58] <arc_> what do you mean off screen
[20:32:36] <DarkGhost> like move your mouse off of the screen and come back lol
[20:32:47] <arc_> oh
[20:32:50] <arc_> did you upload it
[20:35:35] <DarkGhost> i  can
[20:35:36] <DarkGhost> hold on
[20:35:48] <DarkGhost> there y ago
[20:35:49] <DarkGhost> let me know
[20:36:28] <arc_> Es0teric ok i see what your problems are
[20:36:46] <arc_> first, var added was not actually being initialized
[20:37:25] <arc_> second your if/else logic is all messed up
[20:37:44] <DarkGhost> www.bmax.io/dev/
[20:37:47] <Es0teric> arc_ i figured the if/else logic was messed up lol
[20:42:27] <arc_> Es0teric https://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/6/
[20:42:41] <arc_> fix how you have two elements with class nav and that works
[20:43:43] <arc_> do you want navbar-right or the other one
[20:43:54] <arc_> i'm guessing navbar-right
[20:43:58] <arc_> in that case,
[20:44:20] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/zy29kdrj/7/
[20:44:54] <arc_> wtf DarkGhost is this for real
[20:45:23] <DarkGhost> lmao
[20:45:23] <DarkGhost> why
[20:45:27] <DarkGhost> what d you mean
[20:45:34] <arc_> it's doing the same shit as before now
[20:45:48] <parveen> how to reinitilize the tinymce on ajax page load ?
[20:46:39] <Es0teric> arc_ ah i see
[20:46:47] <Es0teric> that makes a lot of sense
[20:52:12] <parveen> how to reinitilize the tinymce on ajax page load ?   i am using version 4 and used classes instead of id
[20:53:49] <arc_> DarkGhost i honestly have no idea why this only works after you move the cursor outside the window
[20:53:51] <arc_> that makes no sense to me
[20:54:31] <arc_> hopefully someone else can help you
[21:01:51] <parveen> Any help on tinymce ... how to reinitilize the tinymce on ajax page load ?   i am using version 4 and used classes instead of id
[21:28:10] <NaN> does someone knows how can I animate a linear-gradient with jquery or velocityjs?
[22:38:42] <parveen> how to re init tinyMCE on ajax page load ?
[22:41:48] <geste> exactly the same way as in a basic side load?
[22:47:44] <parveen> geste i tried but after ajax page reload init not working
[22:51:32] <geste> maybe u used the init again on the same textarea? try to remove it first with tinymce.remove
[22:52:39] <parveen> geste i used this - tinyMCE.remove();
[22:52:56] <parveen> but not editor appears on first class only
[22:53:11] <parveen> not on all textarea with same class
[22:53:35] <_genuser_> hello folks. if you have a page being viewed over ssl, you cannot include jquery from a non-ssl cdn, is the case?
[22:54:29] <geste> parveen - but on the first class it works, as i understand it?
[22:56:15] <parveen> i have more than 10 textarea having same class
[22:56:31] <parveen> geste  i have more than 10 textarea having same class
[22:56:48] <phiz> _genuser_: you can just do something like <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js"></script>
[23:00:14] <_genuser_> phiz: what does that do? auto select http or https?
[23:00:47] <parveen> geste you there?
[23:02:36] <geste> parveen - yeah, i am, tried to get the same problem on an existing page  - u re really sure, that the remove "hit" all existing tinymce textareas?
[23:02:49] <_genuser_> phiz: nm, just tried it and it works both ways. thanks for mentioning.
[23:03:52] <parveen> geste   not sure , i just used this  -  tinymce.remove();   and i hope it should remove all tinyMCE on page
[23:06:02] <geste> oh, yeah, that is it, maybe my fault because im not saying this explicitly, this only removes the first tinymce-instance
[23:06:46] <parveen> ohhh , then how to remove all ?
[23:06:58] <geste> u need to get all of it, try to get all with $('.myclass').each(    $(this).tinymce().remove()
[23:11:00] <parveen> geste :  TypeError: $(...).tinymce is not a function
[23:13:34] <geste> oh wrong version, try something like that:
[23:13:35] <geste>   var length = tinyMCE.editors.length;
[23:13:35] <geste>   for (var i=length; i>0; i--) {
[23:13:35] <geste>     tinyMCE.editors[i-1]
[23:13:48] <geste> …     .remove()
[23:15:16] <Uhkis> don't paste to irc.
[23:16:41] <geste> yeah    -  did it worked?
[23:17:20] <parveen> geste  .. :(  not working
[23:18:35] <geste> alternative u can get the instances by using tinymce.get(myid) - should also working while running over the instance with for ...
[23:19:01] <geste> with tinymce.editors.length, how many active editors u find?
[23:19:11] <parveen> it shows 5
[23:25:28] <parveen> geste are you checking this?
[23:28:05] <geste> yeah, sorry im a little bit in trouble here, because of work
[23:28:26] <geste> disturb me sometimes
[23:28:29] <geste> :)
[23:31:22] <parveen> geste  :(  , this issue is taking too much time , many solutions on web but nothing seems to work
[23:31:43] <geste> when u use the last example it should work - running threw all active editors and remove them
[23:32:02] <geste> cant understand why it should not work
[23:32:04] <geste> :(
[23:34:07] <parveen> geste , yes it should work for all editors , not sure whats going wrong
[23:34:09] <geste> there are a lot possibilities to run over all active tinymce editors - maybe try to find another solution by web and then use the .remove()  method - because it should work this way
[23:41:48] <geste> mayve, to find the error, try to do it 2 times - first u run over all active instances and remove them - then try to find all active instances again, do u find 5 again?
[23:47:03] <parveen> geste  it shows 5 before removing
[23:54:49] <geste> parveen, ok, when its gone after that, so u find no active editors, the remove should work, that means something with your init is wrong
[23:55:41] <geste> is it the same init, u used the first time, or u changed something?
