[00:00:44] <stan_man_can> sorry I see there's a keypress event, but it doesn't fire on backspace
[00:01:16] <stan_man_can> keydown does, but keydown doesn't fire when you hold down a key
[00:01:40] <coldhead> lisak: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L301
[00:03:07] <mello> attr('checked',true) doesn't do anything; I use jquery 1.5.2
[00:03:08] <mello> http://jsfiddle.net/gv2aN/1/
[00:11:28] <abjorn> someone needs to fix ihateyou's internet connection
[00:11:31] <sphinxxxx> is there an easy way to add a "news" /blog section to a site without doing a full fledge wordpress/blog install
[00:12:32] <coldhead> mello: .attr('checked', 'checked') ?
[00:12:44] <coldhead> wtf ihateyou
[00:12:49] <abjorn> lol
[00:12:55] <abjorn> fix your internet ihateyou
[00:13:01] <mello> coldhead: found the problem. i use jquery mobile, it needs an extra refresh to see it's change
[00:13:22] <coldhead> good work mello
[00:13:45] <abjorn> man it's been awhile since I've used straight up XHR without jQuery
[00:13:45] <mello> i should've checked before, but I rtfm xd
[00:16:49] <coldhead> i have never used straight xhr
[00:17:02] <coldhead> or getElementbyId
[00:17:27] <abjorn> lol, really, never?
[00:17:37] <abjorn> what you never used javascript before finding jquery?
[00:17:55] <coldhead> god no
[00:18:04] <eml> :'D
[00:18:09] <abjorn> haha
[00:18:20] <coldhead> pure JS across browsers is madness
[00:18:33] <eml> I think we should all be jealous of coldhead
[00:18:33] <coldhead> i would rather saw my own leg off
[00:18:37] <abjorn> I had been messing around with javascript for a year or so before I found out about jquery
[00:18:42] <Trisox> question is it possible to reset a <input type="text"  value="lalala"/> in a form but leave the rest i want to reset the form partly
[00:18:59] <abjorn> eh, XHR isn't that bad without a library
[00:19:37] <abjorn> it takes about 15 lines of code to wrap up cross-browser stuff and some other obfuscations for XHR so not that big of a deal
[00:20:10] <eml> The company I'm doing my internship at doesn't use jQuery even though they're writing a lot of JS code that would probably be a few hundred lines less if they just caved in :-p
[00:20:31] <abjorn> lol I've had the opposite problem in the past
[00:21:34] <abjorn> client I was doing some js debugging for was really dead set on keeping jQuery even though the actual amount of jQuery even used was tiny and unneeded
[00:22:11] <coldhead> how can a company resist jquery?
[00:22:39] <abjorn> lol idk. most major libraries like Dojo really aren't THAAAT different.
[00:22:45] <eml> I believe one reason is that they don't want to support code written by someone else
[00:23:12] <coldhead> Not Invented Here syndrome?
[00:23:39] <coldhead> AKA  we-don't-want-free-debugging-by-github?
[00:23:48] <mello> anyone here ever worked with things like closure tools?
[00:24:05] <abjorn> I use the closure compiler but that's about it
[00:24:27] <mello> not the advanced setting i guess?
[00:24:38] <abjorn> I had trouble with that one for some reason
[00:24:45] <abjorn> it seemed to break a lot of my code
[00:25:04] <eml> coldhead: Yeah ;)
[00:25:26] <eml> coldhead: I think their minds will change (or about to change) as my project goes on
[00:26:11] <coldhead> good luck with that
[00:28:51] * coldhead hugs cold-t
[00:28:54] * cold-t hugs coldhead back
[00:29:20] <abjorn> :o
[00:29:26] * abjorn hugs cold-t
[00:29:27] <coldhead> ?eval typeof $.ajaxSettings
[00:29:27] * cold-t hugs abjorn back
[00:29:28] <cold-t> coldhead: "object"
[00:29:40] <abjorn> ?js $
[00:29:40] <cold-t> abjorn: <function (selector, context) {return new (jQuery.fn.init)(selector, context);}>
[00:29:56] <mello> noobquestion, but i can't find the answer: how can i check if a certain selector returned something or not?
[00:30:01] <abjorn> anyways, I'm gonna go sleep and dream about jaboscript, night
[00:30:15] <abjorn> mello: $('selector').length
[00:30:26] <abjorn> later
[00:31:19] <juha___> coldhead, my favorite austrian shemale
[00:42:14] <lisak> if I create a widget, I can then initialize it like this :  $('#name').name();  ?
[00:43:18] <coldhead> that is a common way to do things in jQuery, yes
[00:50:10] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all, what is the shortcut to autocomplete names in mIrc?
[00:50:30] <eml> Tab
[00:51:08] <Whirl3d> eml, thanks
[00:51:46] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know what causes the error: Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy"  code: "3
[00:53:42] <eml> Whirl3d: What are you inserting and where?
[00:55:03] <Whirl3d> I am loading some content via ajax and inserting into a temporary div. The thing is that when I first load the browser, it doesn't give me the error. When I refresh it does. If I clear the cache and refresh it still gives me the error
[01:00:11] <eml> jsfiddle.net the HTML & insert-related code
[01:00:19] <eml> and the line which gives you an error
[01:03:58] <Whirl3d> eml, lemme ask you this: did Jquery 1.6 change the data format returned in an ajax call? Instead of getting text in html format, I'm getting "document" ?
[01:04:00] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7PRzp/2/
[01:07:25] <Whirl3d> and the strange thing is that if I make a jquery object out of the data returned, I can set the temp's HTML to $(data).text()  with no problems...but not to $(data).html
[01:07:32] <Whirl3d> *.html();
[01:09:07] <Whirl3d> wow, it's a quiet night in here. I don't think I have ever seen it this quiet....
[01:09:28] <xec> Whirl3d: try including an older jquery version
[01:09:50] <xec> Whirl3d: i think they indeed did change the return object
[01:12:53] <Whirl3d> xec, thanks. I haven't been able to find it in the api anywhere.
[01:13:15] <Whirl3d> xec, even if I set the dataType option to 'html' it returns null
[01:14:25] <xec> i'm sorry, i havent actually tried neither ajax or 1.6 yet :P
[01:14:45] <morsik> hi
[01:14:59] <xec> just nobody was answering you and i've seen talk about it being changed ;)
[01:15:02] <morsik> it's possible to do in jquery multiple object catch?
[01:15:27] <morsik> i mean something like: for (var v in enabled) $('#enable-' + v).click();
[01:15:39] <morsik> now with this, i get working only last v
[01:16:08] <Whirl3d> morsik, what are you trying to get?
[01:17:03] <morsik> Whirl3d: i have multiple checkboxes which doing the same
[01:17:08] <morsik> but on other site elements
[01:17:11] <Whirl3d> morsik, by using the ID selector, you will only get one item returned because you can't have multiple objects with eh same id.
[01:17:26] <borwar> I'm having a problem with jQuery UI tabs. If I place tabs into the content of a tab, the first subtab does not show the content by default. I have to click on the tab first. How can I have the content shown by default?
[01:17:27] <morsik> i know
[01:17:38] <morsik> but i have: #id-server1 #id-server2 #id-server3 etc.
[01:17:41] <morsik> so it's different
[01:18:06] <morsik> ugh. #enable-srv1 #enable-srv2
[01:19:32] <Whirl3d> morsik, var nm="enable-srv"+v; $("#"+nm).click(handler) would work. Though I am not sure why your selector above won't work. Unless it's because your ids or "enable-srv"+v
[01:20:47] <Whirl3d> borwar, sorry I'm no help for you here. I haven't used UI tabs
[01:23:53] <Whirl3d> Okay, so it must be something in my document header. It must not like the docType declaration because a straight text file (with no docType declaration) loads fine. Hrm.
[01:26:10] <morsik> Whirl3d: doesn't works... still working only last element
[01:26:50] <morsik> i just don't want defining 6 identical functions :\
[01:28:35] <morsik> code is something like this: http://551.cpaste.eu/
[01:29:10] <Whirl3d> morsik, try this selector: $("input[id^='enable-srv']").click(handler).   No for loop, just that selector
[01:31:46] <Whirl3d> also, morsik, in your html are the buttons labeled "enable-1" "enable-2" etc. or are they labeled "enable-srv1", "enable-srv2"?
[01:32:00] <morsik> they are labeled enable-something
[01:32:08] <morsik> enable-other enable-anotherserver enable-*
[01:32:25] <morsik> and * is name in 'enabled' array
[01:32:48] <Whirl3d> morsik, then use the selector "input[id^='enable-'
[01:32:50] <morsik> Whirl3d: your method doesn't works. it's impossible to get string after enable-
[01:33:07] <morsik> but how can i change value in enabled[]?
[01:33:34] <morsik> i had previously: enabled[v] = $('#enable-' + v).is(':checked');
[01:33:44] <morsik> but now i don't have loop so i don't have 'v'
[01:35:13] <morsik> Whirl3d: html objects are not buttons, but checkboxes
[01:35:35] <Whirl3d> the selector, "input[id^='enable-']"  says, select all input elements whose ID starts with 'enable-'
[01:35:55] <morsik> that i understand
[01:35:56] <Whirl3d> It should select all of them without having to loop
[01:36:13] <Whirl3d> $(this) will tell you the value for v
[01:36:20] <morsik> but how can i now change value of specific enabled[]?
[01:36:25] <morsik> Whirl3d: that i know too
[01:36:33] <morsik> but i don't know what element i'm clicking
[01:36:38] <Whirl3d> $(this).attr("id").substr($(this).attr("id").lastIndexOf("-"));
[01:37:23] <Whirl3d> morsik, i need to see the html, I guess. Can you post a working fiddle on jsfiddle.net?
[01:40:12] <morsik> Whirl3d: http://388.cpaste.eu/
[01:40:42] <russian1> would someone please advise why the security code verification doesn't work here http://valeria.orgfree.com/#contact?
[01:41:03] <russian1> it's an ajax contact form and it's obviously in conflict with all the other js
[01:41:13] <russian1> but it only doesn'twork in IE
[01:41:24] <russian1> so there should be fixes, I guess
[01:42:03] <russian1> I'm sorry it's http://valeria.orgfree.com/#contact
[01:43:40] <giohappy> hi, I'm just creating on the fly DOM elements, without attaching them to the window (just to prepare them for later use)
[01:43:44] <giohappy> this causes problems
[01:43:49] <giohappy> to the page
[01:43:55] <giohappy> is it a bug, or is it wanted?
[01:44:01] <Whirl3d> morsik, perhaps you should be asking for help in #PHP, Since 90% of your page is PHP and maybe three lines of javascript. I don't have the patience to wade through that much php to solve a jquery problem. Sorry I couldn't be any more help.
[01:44:14] <morsik> ugh
[01:44:18] <morsik> but this is js problem lol.
[01:44:27] <Whirl3d> yeah, right./
[01:44:49] <morsik> php page is generated correctly, js works too
[01:45:01] <morsik> but only if i write function for every checkbox
[01:45:13] <morsik> i just need one piece of code for every
[01:45:15] <Whirl3d> Have you loaded jquery?
[01:45:23] <morsik> ...
[01:45:26] <morsik> 104448 < morsik> php page is generated correctly, js works too
[01:45:42] <morsik> and $('input[id^="enable-"]').click(function() don't want to catch my checkboxes
[01:46:22] <morsik> generally i want:
[01:46:50] <morsik> if i click on #enable-someserver2 then js changed value of enabled['someserver2'] to the same as checkbox has
[01:46:51] <giohappy> solved... sorry, after minutes looking for the problem I found it
[01:47:56] <russian1> could somebody please help with the contact form security code http://valeria.orgfree.com/#contact
[01:48:12] <Whirl3d> morsik, do you have "enabled" defined globally?
[01:48:15] <russian1> it doesn't work in IE8, the form keeps saying that it is wrong
[01:48:26] <morsik> Whirl3d: ok. i did it
[01:48:28] <morsik> Whirl3d: yes
[01:48:35] <xec> morsik: do you have a live url?
[01:48:45] <morsik> var v = $(this).attr("id").substr($(this).attr("id").lastIndexOf("-")+1);      enabled[v] = $(this).is(':checked');
[01:49:16] <Whirl3d> morsik, that doesn't work? It seems like it should
[01:49:21] <morsik> Whirl3d: the problem was that your code results in: "-someserver". i just added +1
[01:49:26] <morsik> so i get now 'someserver'
[01:49:28] <morsik> and this works now
[01:49:30] <morsik> Whirl3d: thanks
[01:49:48] <Whirl3d> morsik, glad you got it handled.
[01:51:03] <Guest78913> how do I use selector like this: alert($('.$(this).this.id').text());
[01:51:36] <seutje> $('.' + this.id)
[01:52:45] <seutje> or a good old document.getElementsByClassName(this.id);
[01:53:02] <quicksilver> find something with the same class as this object's ID? an unusual request.
[01:53:29] <seutje> u must be new in this channel if u find that unusual :P
[01:55:03] <lisak> coldhead, what do you mean that it is common way to do things in jquery ... as to widget initialization   $('#name').name();
[01:57:35] <lisak> then the object is stored into $('#widgetName').data('widgetName')  I guess
[01:57:43] <coldhead> lisak: if you use the jQuery AJAX Form Plugin you apply it with $('#formid').ajaxForm()
[01:58:10] <coldhead> and jQuery cycle is $('#gallery').cycle()
[02:02:23] <MarcelT3> hey there
[02:03:52] <MarcelT3> i got smth like this: $('#bg').attr('title', '<h1 id="h1-bg">Headline</h1><p>Stuff</p><h2>More Stuff</h2><ul><li>111</li><li>222</li></ul>');
[02:04:21] <MarcelT3> is there a way to make it multiline? so the value will be read from let's say 10 lines instead of doing it all in one line?
[02:05:53] <akheron> MarcelT3: 'foo' + 'bar' + 'baz'
[02:06:05] <MarcelT3> thx akheron
[02:06:33] <MarcelT3> so there's no multiline value syntax?
[02:06:58] <akheron> MarcelT3: no
[02:09:59] <MarcelT3> i think i found a way:
[02:10:25] <MarcelT3> the multiline character \
[02:10:31] <MarcelT3> as known from shell \
[02:10:34] <MarcelT3> might work out. :)
[02:13:45] <silverdiamond> Morning all, quick question about the jq ui autocomplete: how do you detect if there are no results when searching a pre-defined array? I am look to setup a custom message in the results area ('No results could be found')
[02:14:06] <ahandy> hello :) i have a question, i made a slider that uses ui.value however i want to add arrows to it so that the user can either manually scroll or just click the arrows :) however, i cant find any way to relate both together :/ any help?
[02:15:36] <Wipp> how do I use selector like this: alert($('.$(this).this.id').text());
[02:15:43] <seutje> forreal?
[02:16:13] <quicksilver> Wipp: do you even know what that means? Can you describe what you are trying to do in words?
[02:16:14] <Wipp> never mind ha
[02:16:19] <seutje> Wipp: getting a strong déjà vu feeling here
[02:16:33] <Wipp> =)
[02:16:43] <ahandy> i cant store a variable with ui.value can i? i have to have a slider, correct?
[02:40:39] <sveri1> hi, i am using the autocomplete plugin, and i need it to fire the autocomplete when i click into the textfield, are there any solutions for this?
[02:55:57] <Wiz_KeeD> how hard it is to add 220 top margin with jquery using a very nice easing effect onmousein, and add negative margin onmouseout
[02:55:58] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[03:04:34] <imakewebthings> Hey folks, I thought 1.6 added the ability to use += and -= in the .css setter method.  Is there something I'm doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/CkdTZ/  or is it a legit bug
[03:13:29] <seutje> imakewebthings: odd, guess it doesn't work for some props, care for a simple workaround? http://jsfiddle.net/CkdTZ/1/
[03:15:52] <Altreus> I have an annoyance I'm trying to resolve. I have a Sortable, but when I start to drag, the page gets shorter and the item suddenly moves up relatively. Then the placeholder kicks in and the page gets longer again, but the damage is done. It's magicked itself into the wrong place. Any ideas to fix this?
[03:16:10] <imakewebthings> seutje, i have one in place already, but thanks.  Padding doesn't seem to work in the same vein, despite it being one of the examples on the API page.  width works fine.  havne't tested others
[03:16:48] <seutje> Altreus: set an explicit height on the wrapper on startdrag and remove it on stopdrag or something?
[03:17:15] <seutje> imakewebthings: prolly coz they have shorthands
[03:17:22] <Altreus> hmm
[03:18:05] <imakewebthings> seutje: what because they have shorthands?
[03:18:35] <Wiz_KeeD> how hard it is to add 220 top margin with jquery using a very nice easing effect onmousein, and add negative margin onmouseout?
[03:19:12] <Altreus> use jquery to add the css and css3 to add the easing :)
[03:19:16] <Wiz_KeeD> simulate a dropdown effect
[03:19:23] <Wiz_KeeD> css3 for easing?
[03:19:25] <Altreus> slideDown is a jQuery function
[03:19:31] <imakewebthings> wiz_keed, its not hard, but it sounds like your user is going to have to keep her mouse moving to stay within the element :P
[03:19:32] <Altreus> ?slideDown
[03:19:33] <bot-t> .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[03:19:38] <seutje> ?animate @ Wiz_KeeD
[03:19:38] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:19:49] <seutje> slideDown doesn't let u specify the easing, does it?
[03:20:13] <Wiz_KeeD> basically i have some images at the top of the page with 250 px negative margin
[03:20:36] <Wiz_KeeD> all i want is to slide them down with a nice smooth effect onmouseover and slide them back onmouseout
[03:20:38] <le_coeur> Hi, how can I convert a html code to javascript string?: i have the html code, and I want it to use in javascript as string(hardcoded), the code is very big, therefore I don't want to make it manual (replace escape symbols), can I do it quick with some external program?
[03:20:40] <Wiz_KeeD> that's pretty much it
[03:20:46] <seutje> so get to it then
[03:21:06] <Wiz_KeeD> first i need to find a plugin that lets me write the query in joomla
[03:21:15] <seutje> wat?
[03:21:33] <imakewebthings> hrm, anyway, will look into tests and bug reporting, later
[03:22:56] <le_coeur> ok, i have found )
[03:26:59] <lisak> coldhead, so that when ajaxForm() is called on the node  var form = $('#formId'); form.ajaxForm();       , it is searching for this "$.fn.ajaxForm" ??
[03:28:58] <ahandy> can i use ui.value when not in a slider?
[03:35:47] <Altreus> looks like the jumping-around behaviour happens before I get the start event. Oh well, low priority
[03:45:23] <ahandy> please, anyone! i need help with ui.value
[03:48:45] <AxonetBE> When using uniform I can not select all selectboxes with jquery
[03:48:59] <AxonetBE> I do $("td.in_mail span").addClass("checked");
[03:49:18] <AxonetBE> he add in the span class="checked"
[03:49:31] <AxonetBE> but when I submit he don't keep the valiue, the checkboxes are also checked in the view
[03:51:49] <slashwalker> hi
[03:52:04] <netActio1> Hi! I need something like var foo={'x':3}; $(element).click(function(){ alert(foo['x']); });
[03:52:08] <netActio1> Is that possible?
[03:52:14] <slashwalker> I'm currently playing around with facebook like box
[03:52:48] <slashwalker> likebox gets placed within iframe. any chance to do some dom stuff with jquery?
[03:53:38] <slashwalker> want to replace some text,append text and set css attributes dynamically
[03:53:58] <netActio1> slashwalker: Only if the iframe has the same domain.
[03:54:45] <slashwalker> of course not, the iframe domain is facebook.com
[03:54:55] <slashwalker> any hack/workaround?
[03:55:05] <netActio1> no
[03:55:57] <netActio1> But you can use greasemonkey or something else you install on your computer.
[04:05:47] <JSM87> Hi guys, this works in chrome but not in firefox. Any idea why? http://pastebin.com/1jjn0FWf

[04:07:33] <JSM87> netActio1: I cant put it in a script as the code is loaded from ajax into a dialog box, so any javascript in script is not rendered hence ONCHANGE event works best..
[04:08:13] <netActio1> JSM87: You can not load javascript code with ajax. It will not be executed.
[04:08:23] <safzouf> So, how to configure it?
[04:08:35] <JSM87> netActio1: You can if its in an onchange in a select...
[04:08:37] <netActio1> The only possibility is <script src="new code" />
[04:08:55] <JSM87> netActio1: Thats not true as it does work, it just doesnt copy the contents html() in firefox
[04:09:53] <netActio1> dunno

[04:27:38] <letsgojuno> anyone know how to fire only one callback when fading out multiple items?  It needs to be once all elements have faded out.
[04:31:10] <coldhead> $('.elem').add('p, div').fadeOut() ?
[04:32:47] <seankoole> letsgojuno, I think ben alman has a plugin for that
[04:32:59] <seankoole> also, letsgojuno you can use deferred
[04:33:00] <seankoole> s
[04:33:47] <letsgojuno> didnt know deferreds could be used with animations, i'll have a look thanks
[04:39:32] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all. I have been working on a page that loads some ajax and suddenly I keep getting this error: Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy" code: "3
[04:40:00] <JKarsrud> Whirl3d: some invalid stuff in your response maybe?
[04:40:04] <Whirl3d> I am now getting this error on pages that worked fine yesterday and haven't had any changes made. Any ideas what is going on?
[04:40:46] <Whirl3d> JKarsrud, thanks for the reply. The thing is that pages that worked yesterday are giving me this error.
[04:41:12] <JKarsrud> Nothing has been changed on the server either?
[04:41:26] <JKarsrud> Like.. NOTHING has changed?
[04:42:15] <Whirl3d> JKarsrud, nothing on my local server that I use to debug at least. I haven't posted anything since I started getting this error...I'll check the online stuff to see if I get the same error.
[04:42:53] <JKarsrud> do it :)
[04:43:41] <letsgojuno> can anyone see where i'm going wrong here, http://jsfiddle.net/yagqV/1/ trying to use Deferred objects to get a single callback when fading multiple items out
[04:44:23] <Whirl3d> JKarsrud, here's the crazy thing. I think it's a firebug issue. Now that I test the on-line version in FF, I get firebug errors. Chrome works fine, but I can't use chrome to do local debugging because of SOP
[04:45:05] <Whirl3d> Isn't there some way around SOP for local debugging?
[04:45:11] <JKarsrud> hm, yeah
[04:45:19] <JKarsrud> the easiest way is to use a webserver :P
[04:45:20] <JKarsrud> ;)
[04:45:22] <JKarsrud> locally
[04:45:47] <Whirl3d> I am running a local webserver through NuSphere Phped
[04:47:22] <JKarsrud> and chrome still has issues?
[04:48:00] <Whirl3d> yup. I'm running Chrome 11.0.686.0 (76198)
[04:52:22] <djQuery>    so y cant u use chrome?
[05:03:32] <rns> anyone know how to get these tabs to work? http://jsfiddle.net/Eu6P9/
[05:04:01] <Whirl3d> djQuery, hey there. I keep getting SOP errors when trying to debug locally.
[05:13:13] <bianchi> hi there. I have problem with selector
[05:13:23] <bianchi> I have html form ovbject in one variable
[05:13:46] <bianchi> and I want to select input element (from form) with specified name
[05:20:31] <finbrein> hi, I would like to jquery plugin to do pagination, filtering, searching and sorting. I am using a java servlet and connecting to a MyQSL database to get data. plz advise
[05:22:09] <finbrein> you can see what i've done so far - http://app.cc.puv.fi/eventfield/
[05:22:26] <finbrein> can you view that page?
[05:22:50] <finbrein> hoefully no firewall is blocking it from outsiderz
[05:23:00] <dabear> it is viewable
[05:23:08] <dabear> what is your question?
[05:23:29] <finbrein> I would like to have jquery plugin to do pagination, filtering, searching and sorting.  I am using a java servlet and connecting to a MyQSL database to get data. plz advise
[05:23:33] <bianchi> nobody to answer mine question?
[05:23:33] <dabear> server side technology doesn't really matter though
[05:23:42] <dabear> advice on what?
[05:24:28] <dabear> finbrein: http://www.webdesignbooth.com/15-great-jquery-plugins-for-better-table-manipulation/
[05:24:40] <finbrein> I have tried different plugins to do paginate, filter and search my query result but doesn't work very well
[05:25:09] <dabear> make it your self or pay someone
[05:25:10] <dabear> then
[05:26:11] <finbrein> I would prefer the first one on the list but i tried using it yesterday but doesn't work
[05:28:18] <dabear> ?mlu @ finbrein
[05:28:19] <bot-t> finbrein, much like urself
[05:28:54] <finbrein> dabear, bot-t - what do you mean?
[05:29:09] <dabear> you don't work either
[05:29:12] <bittyx-laptop> okay, i have an ajax-enabled search box on my site, and it's mostly working. i use .keyup() to set a timer to fetch the results after one second. however, this also refreshes the content when a non-changing button is pressed/released, like, say, shift. on the other hand, .change() only gets triggered after the user leaves the input box. is there some middle ground here? e.g. check for changes on .keyup() ? i mean, i could do that manually, but
[05:29:12] <bittyx-laptop> was just wondering if there was a better solution
[05:29:57] <finbrein> fck
[05:30:08] <finbrein> that is rude
[05:30:08] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: save the old value in a variable. then on keyup check if that value is different from the new value
[05:30:30] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: yeah, that's what i mean by doing it manually. okay, thanks.
[05:31:05] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: i've already done that actually, i just want to keep my code as clean/readable/efficient as possible, so i was asking if a better way exists. thanks again.
[05:34:52] <bianchi> why on form element filter does not work
[05:34:58] <bianchi> i have it like this
[05:35:12] <bianchi> $(form_object).filter(":input")
[05:35:15] <bianchi> returns nothing
[05:35:30] <bianchi> but just $(form_object)
[05:35:36] <bianchi> returns form with input as childs
[05:36:20] <dabear> bianchi: you want .find
[05:36:22] <dabear> not .filter
[05:37:22] <bianchi> dabear, thanks!
[05:37:43] <dabear> np, the fee is 5$ per answered question though
[05:37:49] <krz> anyone know an alternative download for http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/download/#
[05:37:50] <dabear> :p
[05:37:58] <krz> download link is broken
[05:38:33] <finbrein> so what is your advice on the plugin
[05:39:51] <heatxsink> hi, i'm trying to add a debug flag to shut off this console, can anyone in here help me out with how to do that? http://jsfiddle.net/heatxsink/N8cV3/
[05:40:04] <bianchi> hehhe
[05:41:21] <Anitox> if (arguments.length == 1 && DEBUG) {
[05:41:34] <Anitox> at the top, var DEBUG = 1;
[05:41:45] <Anitox> or var DEBUG = 0;
[05:42:45] <heatxsink> Anitox: so from the code if I wanted to set the debug flag how could I make it look like $.log.debug = false;
[05:43:23] <heatxsink> Anitox: i don't know if relying upon a DEBUG var in global scope is a good idea?
[05:44:25] <dabear> heatxsink: you are correct, that is a bad idea
[05:44:30] <Whirl3d> is it only in .ajax that you can assign an array of handlers for success? Or can you do the same with .load
[05:44:55] <Anitox> simplicity
[05:45:05] <Anitox> surely it can be made more complex
[05:45:19] <heatxsink> dabear: cool, essentially I want this plugin to be self sufficient, where I can control weather or not it's shown in the dom via a attrib. it's essentially for debug mode.
[05:45:25] <dabear> Anitox: not to be rude, but your firebug lite asskicks your console implementation
[05:45:27] <dabear> http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[05:45:47] <Anitox> dabear: not to be rude, but i didnt write that console implementation ...
[05:45:48] <dabear> heatxsink: *
[05:45:57] <Jakey> hey
[05:46:06] <Jakey> .outerHeight() doesn't work anymore
[05:46:07] <Jakey> fix it
[05:46:08] <dabear> Anitox: sry, was directed at heatxsink
[05:46:08] <Anitox> I use firebug like a pro
[05:46:11] <Anitox> np
[05:46:20] <heatxsink> dabear: hehe, ya it's just to display some text infos
[05:46:28] <dabear> heatxsink: firebug _lite_
[05:46:30] <dabear> use that
[05:46:37] <heatxsink> dabear: not to inspect dom elements yada yada

[05:47:10] <seutje> if u just want a console
[05:47:12] <dabear> why re-invent the wheel when you have a full blown car with wheels on it?
[05:47:12] <Jakey> help
[05:47:26] <heatxsink> gotcha
[05:47:26] <heatxsink> thx
[05:47:29] <Anitox> firebug has a console in it
[05:47:37] <Anitox> console.log("this goes in teh console.");

[05:48:26] <dabear> seutje: I will if you provide the wunderbaum
[05:49:23] <seutje> ?define wunderbaum
[05:49:25] <DarsVaeda> hi, is there an easy, through most browsers working, solution to implement a "send on enter" with jquery?
[05:49:25] <bot-t> seutje, Did you mean Wonderbra?  - (noun) As "The Wonderbra," a push-up, plunge style brassiere style originally designed and manufactured by the Canadian Lady Corset Company beginning in 1961.
[05:49:41] <DarsVaeda> ?define traumzauberbaum
[05:49:42] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, "traumzauberbaum" is not in the dictionary.
[05:49:47] <DarsVaeda> too bad
[05:50:11] <dabear> seutje: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderbaum
[05:50:16] <Anitox> wonder tree
[05:50:21] <seutje> DarsVaeda: bind on keypress, checkc keycode and do ur sending?
[05:50:54] <Anitox> tannenbaum
[05:50:54] <dabear> if e.which == 13, send
[05:50:57] <seutje> dabear: oooh, arbre magique!
[05:51:00] <DarsVaeda> thats pure js then not jquery, right?
[05:51:00] <seutje> http://www.arbremagique.com/
[05:51:20] <seutje> jquery normalizes e.keycode and e.which, doesn't it?
[05:51:42] <Anitox> the chick on that website is just waiting for a vampire to attack her
[05:51:46] <DarsVaeda> those things stink like shit btw...not talking about the chemicals that get into the air into your lungs, i bet
[05:51:53] <dabear> seutje: you stupid (French || italian || portuguise || spanish )
[05:51:59] <dabear> wunderbaum!
[05:52:20] <Anitox> "For when your car smells like shit and you're too lazy to clean it."
[05:52:21] <DarsVaeda> also they cause a lot of traffic accidents :D
[05:52:53] <seutje> lol "portuguise"
[05:52:55] <dabear> DarsVaeda: becasue the drivers tend to get high on the smell from the wunderbaums?:p
[05:52:59] <seutje> guise from portu!
[05:53:09] <seutje> sry :')
[05:53:10] <dabear> yeah
[05:53:12] <DarsVaeda> ne because they are in your view
[05:53:15] <DarsVaeda> no
[05:53:15] <dabear> too lazy to check the spelling
[05:53:27] <seutje> u can hear the "e" in it :P
[05:53:51] <seutje> portugeez would have been a nice way to spell it ;)
[05:54:20] <seutje> but yea dabear, we tend to prefer the French word over the German
[05:54:24] <seutje> EXCUSE US!
[05:54:30] <dabear> no
[05:54:36] <dabear> I hate you!!1
[05:54:43] <dabear> forget the french
[05:54:50] <dabear> french is stupid!
[05:55:02] <seutje> yea, but if the alternative is german...
[05:55:09] <seutje> lesser of 2 evils :P
[05:55:30] <DarsVaeda> hey nothing against germans :D
[05:55:46] <seutje> I never mentioned the germans
[05:56:32] <dabear> seutje don't hate germans, he just hates their language :/
[05:57:07] <DarsVaeda> okay I am german and I hate it too, understandable
[05:58:54] <dabear> das is gut!
[05:59:00] <dabear> or something like that
[05:59:08] <dabear> ?translate that is good to german
[05:59:09] <Anitox> Das is sehr gut!
[05:59:10] <bot-t> dabear, Translation (English -> German) - das ist gut so
[05:59:19] <Anitox> Das ist gut.
[05:59:27] <Anitox> is correct
[05:59:37] <DarsVaeda> ?translate wow was ist das denn to english
[05:59:38] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, Translation (German -> English) - wow what is that
[05:59:46] <DarsVaeda> hmm
[06:01:01] <Anitox> das ist eine gute Frage
[06:02:02] <DarsVaeda> ?translate eiverbibsch to english
[06:02:03] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, Translation (English -> English) - eiverbibsch
[06:02:09] <DarsVaeda> hahaha, whatever...
[06:04:06] <dabear> ?translate Mora di er ei hurpe!
[06:04:08] <bot-t> dabear, Translation (Italian -> English) - Mora di er and hurpe!
[06:04:16] <dabear> ?translate Mora di er ei hurpe! from norwegian
[06:04:17] <bot-t> dabear, Translation (Norwegian -> English) - Mom is a bitch!
[06:04:40] <seutje> spaß!
[06:04:45] <airstrike> okay, so i have a select field called 'id' and i want to erase all the <option> objects from it. how can i do that?
[06:05:01] <dabear> .find("option").remove()
[06:05:09] <dabear> ?remove @ airstrike
[06:05:10] <bot-t> airstrike, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[06:05:16] <Deele> $('#id option').remove()
[06:05:19] <airstrike> ah, .remove()
[06:05:20] <airstrike> thanks
[06:05:33] <seutje> by 'called' u mean its name attr? o.O
[06:06:07] <Deele> $('slect[name="id"] option').remove();
[06:06:15] <dabear> slect
[06:06:17] <dabear> yeah
[06:06:27] <Deele> select*
[06:06:29] <airstrike> i'm doing select.children().remove();
[06:06:40] <airstrike> where select is the select object, obviously
[06:06:51] <airstrike> how can i remove all but the first <option>?
[06:07:00] <airstrike> not sure how to use .not in this case
[06:07:08] <airstrike> brb flu shot
[06:07:29] <airstrike> and while we're at it, how can i *add* new option objects? =)
[06:07:57] <Deele> select.append('<option>Stuff</option>');
[06:07:58] <seutje> ?gt @ airstrike
[06:07:59] <bot-t> airstrike, :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[06:08:07] <airstrike> .append, nice
[06:08:10] <airstrike> i tried that and it works
[06:08:18] <airstrike> thank you all
[06:08:45] <Deele> $('select[name="id"] option:gt(1)').remove().append('<option>Stuff</option>');
[06:09:47] <seutje> gt is 0 indexed
[06:10:03] <seutje> :gt(1) selects everything starting from the third element
[06:10:17] <dabear> ?slice'
[06:10:19] <bot-t> dabear, .slice() - Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[06:10:33] <dabear> slice is faster
[06:10:47] <seutje> good point
[06:11:36] <heatxsink> thx guys
[06:18:15] <airstrike> seutje: thanks
[06:20:31] <antaranian> hi ladies
[06:20:33] <Whirl3d> which is better? var section=page.data('section')?page.data('section'):findSection(page)     or var section=page.data('section')||findSection(page);
[06:21:26] <antaranian> guys, which is the value of jQuery.support.leadingWhitespace in Internet Explorer 9 ?
[06:21:51] <airstrike> what's the cleanest way to loop over a json object and perform an action for each element in it? it's a simple dictionary like {1: 'this', 2: 'and', 3: 'that'}
[06:22:26] <airstrike> $.each
[06:22:27] <airstrike> found it
[06:22:28] <antaranian> jquery way is $.each(function(key, name){ ...  });
[06:22:30] <Raverix> Whirl3d: The second one, of those two.
[06:22:49] <Raverix> The first one, you're calling page.data('section') twice, which is extra overhead.
[06:22:54] <orolo> airstrike: $.each()
[06:23:09] <orolo> (oops)
[06:24:04] <antaranian> guys, who have IE9 ?
[06:24:17] <Jakey> i have IE 10
[06:24:19] <xec> airstrike: i dont think thats valid json
[06:24:31] <Gruni|office> antaranian, got IE9 via VMWare
[06:24:31] <MatthiasVance> I have IE7-9.
[06:24:50] <Raverix> I don't have any malware.
[06:24:56] <Jakey> i only use IE 10
[06:25:01] <Jakey> and i don't have malware
[06:25:45] <airstrike> xec: how is it not?
[06:25:50] <airstrike> it's working so far
[06:26:06] <antaranian> Gruni|office: MatthiasVance can you check this page ? http://jsfiddle.net/quSnM/
[06:26:20] <Gruni|office> Sure, gimme a sec.
[06:26:37] <MatthiasVance> antaranian: It reports true.
[06:26:45] <antaranian> ok, thank you
[06:26:51] <xec> airstrike: keys need to be strings, not numbers
[06:27:13] <Jakey> what
[06:27:21] <Jakey> you got jQuery
[06:27:22] <Bisu[Shield]> I need a jquery grid that is very flexible any suggestions?
[06:27:23] <Jakey> lol
[06:28:13] <vector_xyz> hey guys
[06:28:18] <vector_xyz> half of my plugins dont work with jquery 1.6
[06:28:23] <vector_xyz> on 1.5.2 works fine
[06:28:33] <Jakey> yes thats lame huh vector_xyz
[06:28:46] <jonkri> i'm using an iframe to do some "ajax" jquery form posting. is it possible to somehow get the content from the iframe when the iframe has reloaded?
[06:28:48] <Jakey> thats what i just said
[06:28:48] <Jakey> <Jakey> can't believe every jquery upgrade( new version come out) it breaks compability
[06:28:49] <orolo> airstrike: [
[06:28:49] <orolo>     {
[06:28:49] <orolo>         "1": "this"

[06:29:53] <airstrike> thanks
[06:29:56] <airstrike> but that's besides the point atm
[06:31:11] <vector_xyz> Jakey: did you fix your problems ?
[06:33:03] <Whirl3d> Raverix, thanks for the reply. So I should only use the first option when the first argument is a jquery selector because jquery returns an empty set rather than undefined..right?
[06:33:28] <astropirate> Anyone know if the object created by jQuery parsing a JSON string has the properties in the right type?  example  if a value in JSON is aNume: 5, will the property be of type Number?
[06:34:21] <djQuery> astropirate: you can always use see .type

[06:35:36] <DavidjQuery> Jakey: what about it?
[06:35:38] <Jakey> aww
[06:35:48] <Jakey> lol
[06:36:33] <Whirl3d> Aw man, I thought you were named for spinnin' it on the ones and twos...
[06:37:33] <djQuery> Whirl3d: I would be more like Johny Fever
[06:37:46] <astropirate> djQuery, Is very nice!  thanks
[06:38:25] <Whirl3d> djQuery, sly like a fox!
[06:38:28] * Jakey give JQuery a slap
[06:38:49] <Aamir> ?hi5 @Jakey
[06:38:49] <bot-t> Jakey, ⁵
[06:39:19] * Jakey is bothering JQuery
[06:39:33] <stefan3> Has anyone ever run into an issue where chrome will wait for all getJSON or ajax queries to finish before loading the content? In my case I am loading urls for images. there is a loop that calls getjson and places the html for each image. chrome will make the html changed but waits for the last getjson to complete before getting the images.
[06:39:47] <Jakey> oh
[06:41:30] <djQuery> stefan3: so you are doing a loop and calling getjson in the loop rather than having the server return multiples and then loop over the results?
[06:41:51] <djQuery> sounds kinda ass backwards
[06:42:19] <stefan3> djbokkeman, I was having the server return all images but the query takes some time and I would rather fill the space while they wait
[06:42:52] <stefan3> djQuery, so now I load each one at a time, but now I ran into this issue
[06:43:15] <dr0id> Hello
[06:43:20] <dr0id> I need some mootools help
[06:43:23] <djQuery> how many requests are we talkin about? there is a limitiation as to how many connections the browser can open and that may be what is holding u up
[06:43:57] <devil2005> how can i run multiple functions but instead of putting the next function in the call back of the previous function so it only runs when the previous function has finished, is there a way to just do something like firsteffect(); secondeffect('wait until previous effect finished');
[06:43:58] <devil2005> ?
[06:44:03] <stefan3> djQuery, around 50-60
[06:44:29] <djQuery> stefan3: bet that is what is zappenin
[06:44:46] <djQuery> dr0id: then /join #mootools
[06:44:53] <lazyPower> exit
[06:45:17] <stefan3> djQuery, any suggestions on how I can have it wait? I tried async but the browser will still do each getjson before loading the images
[06:45:17] <Jakey> lol
[06:45:18] <djQuery> devil2005: not realy
[06:45:25] <Jakey> please djQuery, JQuery
[06:45:31] <Jakey> do ask i ask
[06:46:27] <dr0id> djQuery: ?
[06:47:23] <dr0id> I need mootools help, is that so difficult to understand, huh ?
[06:47:43] <djQuery> stefan3: create an array, create a function that takes an item from the array then does the json. in the success of the json add the image to the page then check to see if the array is now empty. if not have it call the original funciton
[06:48:08] <stefan3> djQuery, thanks I will give that a try
[06:48:11] <djQuery> dr0id: then join the #mootools channel!
[06:48:19] <Jakey> lmao

[07:06:54] <abraxxa> when cloning a tr element using selector.clone(true) and appending it to the table the containing dom nodes are missing their event handlers, e.g. autocomplete
[07:07:16] <abraxxa> i didn't find a bug for it
[07:07:27] <abraxxa> jQuery is version 1.6.1
[07:08:40] <SkiOne> if do: $('#Top').change(function(e)) { } and #Top is the id of a select box, I expected e to be the value but it is not. Is there a way to reference the value of Top using a pointer (this or something like that)?
[07:10:21] <abraxxa> SkiOne: e is the event object according to the docs: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:10:24] <charlton> hi everyone: xperimenting with the ajax .load() , want to load specific id inside the target html, Question is if the id a variable, what should the syntax be inside the '()'???
[07:10:58] <abraxxa> charlton: $var?
[07:11:00] <SkiOne> abraxxa: yes I see that when I log it but how di I address the value?
[07:11:22] <SkiOne> its doesnt look like I can
[07:11:38] <Aamir> SkiDawg:  inside your .change(function(){ $(this).val() OR $(this).text() })
[07:11:40] <abraxxa> SkiOne: $(this)
[07:11:50] <abraxxa> SkiOne: $(this).val();
[07:12:13] <Aamir> opps
[07:12:16] <SkiOne> no way to pass it to the function?
[07:12:17] <abraxxa> SkiOne: text is the label shown and val is the value that will be sent to the server on submit
[07:12:23] <Aamir> SkiOne:  ^  plus http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/g7QrD/
[07:13:04] <charlton> SkiOne:i am not sure if it is possible
[07:13:11] <abraxxa> Aamir: do you have a suggestion for me too?
[07:15:10] <charlton> SkiOne:it works for ('contents.html #idName') for example, but i am not sure how it works in the case if a variable  replacing the specific id or class
[07:16:01] <SkiOne> $(this).val() works well enough, however I would think .chang(function(e) would pass the value, it seems moreintuitive to me.
[07:16:11] <SkiOne> but  thanks!
[07:16:19] <Aamir> abraxxa:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/n3HDc/
[07:16:53] <charlton> i will try it now
[07:17:01] <abraxxa> Aamir: i guess it only doesn't work for nested elements

[07:20:38] <metap0d> Hi everyone, I'm a  jQuery beginner and I have a tiny script I've written that still executes ... but both my IDE and firebug detect a syntax error. Firebug claims "change() is not defined" .. any ideas? http://pastebin.com/9xLPcwG7
[07:20:51] <charlton> mayb i should simplify the question, IS IT POSSIBLE TO REPLACE the FRAMENT (id or class) in .load() to a VARIABLE OR a EQUATION?
[07:21:19] <quicksilver> charlton: YES BECAUSE JAVASCRIPT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND YOU CAN WRITE PROGRAMS IN IT
[07:21:26] <quicksilver> the thing inside the $(...) is just a string
[07:21:36] <quicksilver> you can build that string up using the tools of javascript the programming language.
[07:21:38] <tra> metap0d: well there is no function called change in your code
[07:21:50] <abraxxa> Aamir: maybe it's a jQueryUI 1.8.12 bug then
[07:21:58] <abraxxa> Aamir: i'll try to get a working test case
[07:22:18] <Aamir> abraxxa:  if u think so than make a test and report to UI team :)
[07:22:32] <abraxxa> Aamir: first i need a test case ;-)
[07:22:50] <Whirl3d> charlton, I'd expected to say that yelling wasn't the best way to get a response in this forum, but apparently quicksilver had other thoughts on the matter.
[07:23:07] <charlton> quicksilver: .load('file.html $(variable)')   like this?
[07:23:07] <quicksilver> yelling is a good way to get yelled back at :)
[07:23:13] <metap0d> tra: well that is embarrassing :)
[07:23:17] <Jakey> lol
[07:23:17] <quicksilver> it's not the best way to get a *polite* response.
[07:23:18] <Jakey> fools
[07:23:19] <abraxxa> Aamir: is there a firebug extension that i can use to display the events attached to a dom node?
[07:23:38] <quicksilver> charlton: no. Frankly it appears that you don't know how to program in javascript. THis is a jquery help channel not a javascript one.
[07:23:53] <quicksilver> charlton: I almost don't feel like helping you, but $('file.html ' + variable)
[07:24:08] <Aamir> abraxxa:  console.log( yourElement) and click the link in firebug and select DOM tab
[07:24:09] <quicksilver> or, .load() or whatever.
[07:24:14] <charlton> sorry, quite new to js and jquery
[07:24:44] <tra> metap0d: so you have two dropdown menus and when a user picks something, you do a post request right?
[07:24:53] <charlton> thanks
[07:25:29] <metap0d> tra: I actually have 3 now, but yep.
[07:25:32] <tra> metap0d: what should the change(); on line 27 do?
[07:25:39] <sunmao> Hi! I would like to make a trick for fileuploading, becuase the type="file" is not customizable... Please check this two forms in IE http://jsfiddle.net/W3a3J/16/ and try to upload sg with the red buttons. With the first form you will able to upload a file, the page will be refreshed, but not with the second form. It will just remove the input filed value. The only difference in the two forms that I specified the name of the input at t
[07:25:40] <abraxxa> Aamir: and where in the DOM tab are the event handlers shown?
[07:26:19] <tra> metap0d: if you are just binding the change event for those dropdowns, everything should be a-ok
[07:26:22] <metap0d> tra: One drop down is created on document load, when they make a selection on the 1st one I post and generate the 2nd one, and the same thing for the third
[07:26:48] <metap0d> tra: Yeah it seems to be working for the moment.
[07:27:04] <xvilka> hi! how i can change content of jquery window text or html?
[07:27:12] <xvilka> s/window/dialog
[07:27:19] <tra> metap0d: i see no use for line 27, if your case is just to bind the change-event
[07:27:27] <Aamir> abraxxa:  console.log ( jQueryElement.data('events') )
[07:29:31] <metap0d> tra: I already removed it after you pointed out. I wasn't very comfortable with javascript before starting jQuery so using shorthand syntax and whatnot confuses me. I unfortunately don't have the time to strengthen my JS before jQuery ... so I must try to do both simultanousely
[07:30:31] <jcapinc> I am just having a terrible time with this problem: it is so dumb, I hate IE SO much. but any way
[07:30:47] <jcapinc> How do I get IE to parse a jquery html result as a dom element?
[07:30:53] <jcapinc> IE8 specifically
[07:30:56] <Jakey> jcapinc, yes thats why you shouldn' t mess with IE too much ;)
[07:31:05] <jcapinc> I wish I had a choice, good sir
[07:31:19] <abraxxa> Aamir: none if the input elements has a data or an event attribute in the dom tab
[07:31:28] <Jakey> then you need to explain yourself jcapinc hehehe
[07:31:39] <jcapinc> right, sorry I was in the middle of it
[07:32:01] <Aamir> Aamir: abraxxa:  console.log ( jQueryElement.data('events') )
[07:32:17] <abraxxa> Aamir: the output is undefined
[07:32:36] <jcapinc> ok, so jquery querys html document -> try to use "success" callback to parse out particular elements for insertion on the page -> PROBLEM: selectors are not picking out elements I am certain are there

[07:37:07] <Aamir> silverdiamond:  there must be a callback function where you u can do these modifications

[07:57:34] <abraxxa> djQuery: but the cloned input has the autofocus class already applied
[07:57:50] <abraxxa> it seems this is the cause for your live example to not work here
[07:57:51] <djQuery> well remove the class when you clone it?
[07:58:12] <abraxxa> what about applying the autofocus on clone?
[07:58:20] <djQuery> that as well
[07:58:25] <abraxxa> live would be the neater solution imho

[08:08:52] * Jakey slaps jcapinc
[08:08:54] <Wiz_KeeD> done, solved it
[08:08:59] <Jakey> you still here
[08:09:13] <jcapinc> Jakey what is up?
[08:09:25] <jcapinc> I am
[08:09:36] <jcapinc> I posted the pastebin a few times have you seen it?
[08:09:40] <Jakey> you try outputing data
[08:09:55] <jcapinc> yes
[08:10:04] <Jakey> console.log(data)
[08:10:11] <zulax> djQuery, if I alert the content of the div it does have <img src="url"> but still the page doesnt display image
[08:10:11] <Jakey> what you get?
[08:10:13] <jcapinc> I cannot do that in IE
[08:10:28] <jcapinc> the code works in firefox but not in IE
[08:10:52] <jcapinc> it would be SO nice if IE had at least comparable debug functions to firefox, wouldnt it be?
[08:10:53] <djQuery> zulax: console showing any thing on the network tab?
[08:11:14] <djQuery> jcapinc: errr it does? hit the f12 button
[08:11:37] <zulax> djQuery, i am on chromium, not sure what network tab means
[08:11:39] <jcapinc> that does not have "console.debug" capabilities
[08:11:51] <jcapinc> I have been using the developer tools, it has helped but it is still not as good as firebug
[08:12:02] <Jakey> use alert jcapinc
[08:12:05] <Jakey> :)
[08:12:06] <jcapinc> I am
[08:12:11] <jcapinc> I did, its in the code
[08:12:19] <Jakey> alert(data)
[08:12:23] <jcapinc> line 27
[08:12:26] <jcapinc> in the pastebin
[08:12:40] <jcapinc> er 28 sry
[08:12:56] <jcapinc> and that post request writes to a file, it is an html string,
[08:12:59] <abraxxa> djQuery: i've moved the discussion to #jquery-ui
[08:13:14] <djQuery> Jakey: jcapinc actualy if you have the dev tools open console.log will work. if it is not open it throws an error
[08:13:16] <Jakey> it just doesn't work in iE?
[08:13:30] <jcapinc> let me try that
[08:13:36] <Jakey> it can't find the element you meant?
[08:14:02] <jcapinc> yesthe selectors starting on line 16 do not find elements that clearly exist in the html string
[08:15:16] <XxJackxX> Hi
[08:16:00] <XxJackxX> When I use return false; to stop a button from refreshing, the second time when I press it, the page refreshes
[08:16:03] <jcapinc> djQuery is right, console.log does work: but it produces what I expected: an html string.  good to know for the future though
[08:16:36] <jcapinc> Jakey, do you have any more insight?
[08:16:51] <bhavesh> I wonder why is this not why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/hmC2h/
[08:16:54] <djQuery> abraxxa: if I remove the line where you are manauly calling .focus it works
[08:17:04] <XxJackxX> Sorry?
[08:17:09] <bhavesh> event.pageX and event.pageY
[08:17:20] <Jakey> can you paste the "data" string jcapinc
[08:17:22] <guy> 16:13 guy: why when I run this in browser URL
[08:17:23] <guy> 16:13 guy: javascript: var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('script'); for(var i = elements.length; i--;) elements[i].parentNode.removeChild(elements[i]);
[08:17:23] <guy> 16:13 guy: it returns me
[08:17:23] <guy> 16:14 guy: [object HTMLScriptElement]
[08:17:44] <tbranyen> guy: because you aren't using jquery
[08:18:00] <guy> this is generic javascript question
[08:20:05] <solepixel> i am throwing my hands up about this issue with jquery-bbq

[08:21:32] <jcapinc> Jakey, in progress, hold one minute

[08:31:56] <Jakey> lol
[08:32:04] * Jakey gives jcapinc a big slap
[08:32:27] <Jakey> thats not how you use find()
[08:32:33] <Jakey> it doesn't work like that

[08:33:05] <memetic> maybe http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8327
[08:33:08] <memetic> Dang.
[08:33:08] <jcapinc> Jakey, I tried using it as context and got the same results
[08:33:15] <jcapinc> what do you mean that is now how it works?

[08:34:03] <Michael> http://blogs.sitepoint.com/jquery-161-attr-compatibility-fix/  hearing that that doesn't work
[08:34:41] <jcapinc> Jakey, what is the alternative? how do I accomplish that?
[08:34:47] <jcapinc> how do I select in html then?

[08:37:04] <Jakey> wait..
[08:37:18] <ajpiano> Michael, if someone is having a bug with attr/prop stuff in 1.6.1 then they should file a bug or ask in -dev or something
[08:39:27] <bhavesh> There are no errors now but still the code doesnt work:  http://jsfiddle.net/hmC2h/1/

[08:44:17] <bhavesh> djQuery: yes but by_text1 div doesnt change its position
[08:45:00] <sokie_de> just use the proper selector
[08:46:24] <ngharo> DC1: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/ek4N9/5/ this is proper jsfiddle
[08:46:30] <ngharo> DC1: what is the "proper ID" ?
[08:46:37] <DC1> any number

[08:48:58] <djQuery> DC1: or pull an id from the button that was clicked etc...
[08:49:24] <djQuery> DC1: or better yet do an ajax submit so that they dont actualy go anywhwere
[08:50:34] <bhavesh> djQuery: any idea why so? I also tried using document.getElementById('bv_Text1).style.top and $('#bv_Text1').pageX
[08:52:58] <Engin> even though I do event.preventDefault() the click causes selection
[08:53:18] <Engin> this is a div with a background:url() acting as button.

[08:57:21] <m_e> can you select all td's except the first 2?

[08:59:26] <Jonathon12312> regex question http://jsfiddle.net/PaJHg/2/
[09:00:39] <ngharo> Jonathon12312: appears that regex matches arent evaluated when passed to a function
[09:00:56] <Jonathon12312> is there anyway to get them to be evaluated
[09:00:56] <ngharo> use .match() then pass the results to your function
[09:01:05] <Jonathon12312> cheers
[09:01:06] <Jonathon12312> kk
[09:02:06] <Engin> [repetaing] even though I do event.preventDefault() the click causes selection ?

[09:05:05] <bhavesh> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/hmC2h/4/ :(
[09:05:55] <Iarfen> how i can move the x inside a div?? Not the div, I want to move the elements inside the div, so the elements that aren't shown with overflow can be see if I move, tell me if you don't understand the question xD
[09:06:08] <futini> hi everyones
[09:06:42] <ngharo> Jonathon12312: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/PaJHg/3/
[09:07:23] <quicksilver> bhavesh: why :( ?
[09:07:36] <memetic> Should I use http://code.google.com/p/jquerycomet/ for my readyState == 3/streaming problem?
[09:07:42] <bhavesh> quicksilver: its not changing #bv_Text1 position
[09:07:43] <Jonathon12312> Cheers
[09:07:54] <futini> what is the use for the function update(); ?? i dont find any information about this
[09:07:54] <quicksilver> bhavesh: yes it is. It only happens after you press a key.
[09:07:56] <Jonathon12312> much neater than my solution
[09:08:02] <skamikaze> ?animate @ Iarfen
[09:08:02] <bot-t> Iarfen, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:08:14] <quicksilver> bhavesh: because you attach the click event *inside* the callback for  keydown event. (Why do you do that?)
[09:09:15] <bhavesh> quicksilver: oh didnt notice that but even after clicking a button I can only see coords inside textbosex
[09:09:22] <bhavesh> quicksilver: textboxes
[09:09:33] <bhavesh> but not the div movnig
[09:09:35] <bhavesh> moving..
[09:10:00] <quicksilver> bhavesh: ah.
[09:10:00] <rednblue> i am using jquery with ajax. 1) i have a onclick button event. onclick of that button php page is called and the returned contents is shown in the one <div></div>. 2) problem is that the button on whom i use onclick event; i want to decide whether it should be displayed or not on ajax call. if i overwrite the division containing that button wit ajax data returned(which contains same button with name/id). the ajax call doesnt work
[09:10:08] <quicksilver> bhavesh: but you're trying to use jquery ui position?
[09:10:14] <quicksilver> bhavesh: does jsfiddle even support that?
[09:10:23] <bhavesh> quicksilver: I dunno
[09:10:32] <memetic> :O
[09:10:35] <ngharo> ?paste @ rednblue
[09:10:35] <quicksilver> bhavesh: you at least need to add the UI JS.
[09:10:36] <bot-t> rednblue, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:10:40] <bhavesh> ill try it in another HTML
[09:11:14] <bhavesh> quicksilver: erm? that YUI option?
[09:11:19] <rednblue> ngharo:  how do i paste the code..  there i need to put a seperate php file(for ajax call)
[09:12:23] <ngharo> just paste the javascript and markup and define where the problem is happening
[09:13:21] <ngharo> your question is confusing (as most are without code)
[09:13:23] <rednblue> humm..!!! ok...... most contents am dragging from session  variables & databse. will make a static script similar n put up
[09:13:27] <rednblue> ngharo:
[09:14:14] <rednblue> just that.. the button on whom i do onclick ajax call;   is replaced by button from ajax content
[09:14:39] <rednblue> huh... wait will get some sample code n put on jsfiddle ngharo
[09:17:35] <ccmonster> if i have two elements, how do i put a click event on the parent, but not the child
[09:17:56] <abraxxa> ccmonster: just add it to the parent element?
[09:18:23] <m4xx> eh, var wtf = '<script></script>'; is not valid?
[09:18:41] <m4xx> in firefox it actually ends the </script> block
[09:18:45] <ccmonster> var wtf = $('<script></script>')
[09:18:56] <skamikaze> ccmonster: check event target
[09:19:24] <skamikaze> (or stop propagation from children)
[09:19:36] <m4xx> ccampbell, same result
[09:19:46] <m4xx> it's actually ending my script block
[09:19:46] <ccmonster> how do i stop the propogation to the children from the parents click event listener?
[09:20:05] <ccmonster> yea, it creates a full element
[09:20:14] <m4xx> does anyone else have this effect? http://jsfiddle.net/jfCQ9/
[09:20:16] <skamikaze> ?stopPropagation @ ccmonster
[09:20:17] <bot-t> ccmonster, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[09:20:28] <ccmonster> $('<script/>').attr('src','http://mysource.js')
[09:20:31] <ccmonster> etc etc
[09:20:59] <m4xx> is that not a bug in firefox?
[09:21:03] <ccmonster> so i need to put a click event on the <a> that does stop propogation, and that's all ?
[09:21:07] <skamikaze> m4xx: you maybe want to check out requirejs, $LABJS or any pendant
[09:21:15] <phentges> If $('foo').append('bar'), is $('foo') returned?
[09:21:29] <skamikaze> ?getScript @ ccmonster
[09:21:30] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:21:43] <skamikaze> sry that was for m4xx
[09:21:46] <ccmonster> wrong person
[09:21:47] <ccmonster> :0
[09:23:44] <skamikaze> phentges: try it out? :)
[09:23:56] <dabear> ccmonster: another solution: http://jsfiddle.net/kby9J/
[09:24:33] <outer_space> how long can an ajax call take before there is a problem?  would 5 minutes take too long and break something?
[09:24:49] <outer_space> is there a limit?
[09:24:53] <skamikaze> outer_space: longpulling? :P
[09:24:55] <phentges> Was hoping to avoid that. :) Need to manipulate 'bar' after appending and wanted to know if I could chain.
[09:25:02] <skamikaze> *polling
[09:25:29] <outer_space> I am doing an ajax call that does a database query, some possible queries can take minutes or even 5 minutes
[09:26:04] <skamikaze> 5 minutes for a database query? oO
[09:26:26] <quicksilver> outer_space: varies by browser (and OS possibly) but they'll all timeout eventually.
[09:26:39] <outer_space> its a spatial database and it generates possibly complicated map files
[09:26:57] <outer_space> what will happen to the php script it calls will it complete if the browser times out?
[09:27:07] <skamikaze> outer_space: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO
[09:27:10] <skamikaze> maybe helps
[09:27:20] <quicksilver> outer_space: you are probably better of generating a one-off ID for the query and polling it every N seconds until the query is done or something.
[09:27:59] <skamikaze> outer_space: 5 minutes can be too much for phps execution time
[09:28:42] <outer_space> what if php executes a shell command will it kill the process or let it continue?
[09:30:15] <skamikaze> outer_space: maybe you can spawn a cli thread, but maybe you got the wrong backend language there
[09:30:42] <quicksilver> outer_space: depends how your frontend server and, to some extent, OS, are configured.
[09:30:55] <abraxxa> where can i find a list of all available events?
[09:30:59] <outer_space> I just did a long query experiment that took 12 minutes and jquery ajax and php never timed out
[09:31:15] <quicksilver> outer_space: some browsers have timeouts as long as 60 minutes, I believe.
[09:31:20] <outer_space> everything is working great except that users would have to wait 12 minutes
[09:31:39] <ccmonster> Alright, http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/kby9J/2/ , if you click the a, i dont want the do the slidetoggle, just the link.
[09:33:13] <ngharo> outer_space: node.js handles long polling awesomely.  It's non blocking so while you're say waiting for a result from a database, other things can be happening
[09:34:11] <outer_space> I want to try node.js but id probably get beat up by superiors as soon as theres a library we need thats in php and not in node.js
[09:35:39] <Jakey> found FF 4 bug
[09:37:40] <skamikaze> ccmonster: use the fiddle someone provided you or start to use the docu
[09:37:57] <ccmonster> This appears to have done the trick : http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/kby9J/5/
[09:55:38] <amybunny> Hmm, I've just about worked out a javascript function, but I've heard that jquery might be a far more sane option - would anyone mind checking that over for me?
[10:00:12] <ezrafree> hello
[10:00:35] <ezrafree> amybunny: checking what out? you haven't posted anything...
[10:02:15] <amybunny> ezrafree, http://pastebin.com/Pi5aJ5SK is the function
[10:03:12] <ezrafree> unknown paste ID, it says
[10:03:27] <amybunny> It worked fine when the values weren't taken from a dropdown box, so I'm a bit unsure why they're not making the section visible again on another click. Hmm, could have expired. Let me re-paste really quick
[10:03:49] <amybunny> http://www.text-upload.com/read.php?id=79487&c=3547979 that one even has the previous version of the function that worked without the dropdown box.
[10:04:55] <ezrafree> you'll probably want to post the accompanying html for the dropdown
[10:05:10] <ezrafree> for instance, does the <select> have id="dropdown"
[10:05:13] <amybunny> ok, I'll have that up in a second
[10:05:19] <ezrafree> np
[10:05:38] <djQuery> amybunny: and you get better responses when u use jsfiddle.net
[10:06:44] <amybunny> djQuery, wow, that's pretty awesome :)
[10:07:17] <juha___> i'm planning on putting notifications to my websites: best viewed with google chrome with 1920x1080 resolution

[10:08:08] <djQuery> juha___: u got something against people running i.e. 6 in 800X600?
[10:08:28] <amybunny> http://jsfiddle.net/BUfPz/
[10:08:35] <djQuery> juha___: http://saveie6.com
[10:09:29] <juha___> djQuery: ie5.5 is my browser of choice, supporting some latest bleeding edge browser is just sarcasm.
[10:09:41] <blindMoe> juha___: nice
[10:09:54] <amybunny> ezrafree, http://jsfiddle.net/BUfPz/ (sorry, forgot to post your name in front the first time)
[10:09:59] <djQuery> 5.5? 5 was so much better
[10:10:12] <djQuery> without all that fancy stuff they added in 5.5
[10:10:43] <juha___> djQuery: oh you're some sort of newfag, i only use netscape 3
[10:11:08] <ezrafree> amybunny: what is this code supposed to do exactly?
[10:12:06] <amybunny> ezrafree, the button beside the dropdown box should toggle the area that matches the div ID as hidden/shown
[10:12:32] <amybunny> not sure why it's working on the website as opposed to on JS fiddle (at least the hide is, even if the show isnt)
[10:19:32] <amybunny> ezrafree, any idea why that doesn't work, or how I should go about doing something like that? I'm pretty new to java/js but I've been reading a lot today.
[10:20:39] <ch3mical> Word
[10:20:54] <djQuery> dang jsfiddle is being a $#%#@ today
[10:21:11] <Emnity> anyone here have experience with fancybox?
[10:21:27] <Passport> hiya.. I'm hoping someone can help me out
[10:21:30] <darrennnn> question: probably a stupid one, but given the code <div style="background:red; color:blue; border:1px orange"></div> --- is there a way to remove just one of those styles? removeAttr seems to take the entire 'style' attribute away? thanks for your time
[10:21:54] <Passport> I'm looking for to create a form that would allow a user to easily build queries
[10:21:54] <djQuery> amybunny: is this easier? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/BUfPz/5/
[10:22:12] <sontek> is there a good async file uploader that doesn't require flash?
[10:22:26] <djQuery> sontek: see ?ajaxform
[10:22:38] <djQuery> ?.ajaxform
[10:22:39] <Passport>  it'd be a combination of form elements, the input of which would be pasted into a text area
[10:22:52] <Escherial> hey, i seem to be having an issue where jquery.validation stops my form from submitting, even though i have no validation errors
[10:22:52] <Passport> like you'd enter "50" and "dallas" into text areas it'd use that to fill out a query like SELECT TOP 50 * FROM SUBSCRIBERS WHERE CITY = 'DALLAS'
[10:23:24] <djQuery> Passport: have you looked at jqgrid?
[10:23:31] <srj55> I have a <select> that will have its options dynamically updated (via ajax) based on another <select>.  Is there a plugin for this, or a 'right' way to do this?
[10:23:59] <amybunny> djQuery, kind of. I was going with a toggle because I plan on having multiple selections, and each could be selected and toggled shown/hidden. I could  I suppose use that function over multiple dropboxes though.
[10:24:35] <sontek> djQuery: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/  that?
[10:24:49] <metap0d> Hi everyone, I have a hard-coded <select> menu for Companies and when a change occurs I fire a jQuery function to create & populate another drop down from a database. I also have a third drop down doing the same thing ... the problem is that I query the database with an id and for whatever reason the 2nd dynamically created drop downs <option value=$id> do not get posted ..
[10:25:42] <Passport> djQuery: looks like a great way to display data... but I'm looking for a dynamic form
[10:26:06] <b3nni> thats like asking if u should take your pants down
[10:26:07] <b3nni> of course.
[10:26:51] <Passport> basically it would build an SQL query with data you inputted in the form
[10:26:53] <djQuery> srj55: $('#select1').change(function(){ var $this = $(this), $sel2 = $('#select2'); $sel2.html('');  $.ajax(url: 'myurl.php', data: {option: $this.val()}, success: funciton(data){ loop through the results and add the options}})
[10:27:07] <Passport> it wouldn't run the query.. just display it so that you could copy and paste it
[10:28:02] <djQuery> sontek: yes it can submit the files through a hidden iframe
[10:28:23] <srj55> djQuery: thx
[10:31:56] <Emnity> does anyone here have experience with fancybox?
[10:36:37] <SkiOne> does json support multi-dimensional arrays?
[10:36:38] <djQuery> Emnity: sure someone does see ?ask
[10:36:53] <djQuery> ?ask@emnity
[10:37:07] <djQuery> dang lazy bot today
[10:37:21] <ColKurtz> how's it going guys
[10:37:34] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[10:37:35] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 38 minutes and 58 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 246 seconds
[10:37:42] <Emnity> what does ?ask do?
[10:37:58] <SkiOne> Emnity: dont ask to ask just ask
[10:38:20] <DRSK_> Where can I get help with an accesspoint? Hardware is invite only
[10:38:41] <ColKurtz> ?ask what does ?ask do
[10:38:45] <ColKurtz> lol
[10:39:01] <Emnity> ah
[10:39:17] <djQuery> not having bot-t around is realy annoying now
[10:39:20] <DRSK_> Anyone?!
[10:40:00] <darrennnn> question: probably a stupid one, but given the code <div style="background:red; color:blue; border:1px orange"></div> --- is there a way to remove just one of those styles? removeAttr seems to take the entire 'style' attribute away? thanks for your time
[10:40:25] <djQuery> DRSK_: I got into #hardware just fine. u just need to register your nick first.
[10:41:05] <djQuery> darrennnn: .css
[10:41:19] <Phil`> I have a link in a td in a tr in a table
[10:41:29] <Phil`> on click of said link, I can target $(this).parents('tr')
[10:41:35] <Phil`> but not $(this).parents('table')
[10:41:38] <Phil`> why is this? :S
[10:41:41] <darrennnn> djQuery: that was my first attempt, but i didnt see a way to actually *remove* the style with precision.
[10:41:57] <no5thdimension> how would i color a character if it is a number?
[10:42:09] <djQuery> think you are looking for closest('tr') not parent()
[10:42:39] <Phil`> djQuery, using parents() not parent()
[10:42:58] <gwsavage> darrennnn: you can't totally remove the css but you can set whatever you want to none. background: none
[10:43:08] <djQuery> darrennnn: .css('background', 'auto');
[10:43:13] <gwsavage> there you go
[10:43:37] <Phil`> djQuery, closest('tr') works but not closest('table')
[10:43:39] <darrennnn> hmmm. ty gwsavage, djQuery.
[10:43:47] <darrennnn> i will explore that
[10:44:19] <DRSK_> Can't auth.. /msg NickServ whaat?
[10:44:35] <DRSK_> Says my name ain't valid
[10:44:50] <DRSK_> Cause of the underscore
[10:44:53] <SkiOne> DRSK_:  http://www.goodchatting.com/howtoregnick.html
[10:45:05] <djQuery> phil` that should work unless u have some kinda bad tags not closing correctly or something
[10:45:08] <DRSK_> I have already regges
[10:45:13] <DRSK_> Regged
[10:45:16] <Phil`> djQuery, hum
[10:45:16] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have a string blabla/blabla/xxx/yyy/m3h
[10:45:22] <illmatix> I'm having issues with raphael canvas lib. I have set up the document, attached it to the canvas element, and created a circle. But nothing displays any idea why? The items are in the canvas in the source code.
[10:45:23] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i erase everything after the last slash?
[10:45:26] <Wiz_KeeD> meaning m3h?
[10:45:27] <SkiOne> the underscore is added cause your name might already be in use
[10:45:37] <DRSK_> Yeah
[10:45:48] <DRSK_> So? I can't auth anyway?
[10:45:58] <SkiOne> you can just follow the instructions
[10:46:07] <SkiOne> does your handle normally have the underscore?
[10:46:08] <djQuery> Wiz_KeeD: well a substring and a lastIndexOf would probably get it done
[10:46:16] <DRSK_> I'm on mu phone..
[10:46:20] <Wiz_KeeD> sounds good...
[10:46:23] <djQuery> DRSK_: did you uses a valid email address? did you check ur email?
[10:46:39] <DRSK_> Rly need to ask a quick q in hardware
[10:46:40] <Wiz_KeeD> what i'm trying to achieve is to have another image on mouseover and the normal image onmouseou
[10:46:46] <amybunny> djQuery, would I save that version of javascript to a file and reference it as source, or is there anything else I need to do for jquery to work?
[10:46:48] <Wiz_KeeD> maybe i'm doing this the wrong way...
[10:46:48] <DRSK_> Jesus... I regged years ago
[10:46:53] <Wiz_KeeD> i could just use css i think...
[10:46:55] <amybunny> i checked and the jquery package is installed.
[10:47:22] <Wiz_KeeD> but then again i have no exact css classes or id's for the buttons to specify button 1 has background x and bacground y onmouseover
[10:47:52] <SkiOne> DRSK_:  are you logged into IRC frmo any puter?
[10:48:01] <SkiOne> *another
[10:48:05] <DRSK_> Geeez
[10:48:16] <DRSK_> Identify nick pass
[10:48:22] <DRSK_> How hard was that...
[10:48:36] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i get the LAST lash though djQuery ?
[10:48:38] <SkiOne> you could of said you were already registered
[10:49:45] <djQuery>   var x = '/asdf/wer/zXDCV'; x = x.substring(0, x.lastIndexOf('//'));
[10:50:03] <Passport> Hi all, I'm looking for a script that would take a user's inputted form elements and put them into a text area--suggestions would be appreciated
[10:50:03] <Wiz_KeeD> lastindexof? that really exists
[10:50:04] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[10:50:19] <Wiz_KeeD> hah, neat
[10:50:21] * Wiz_KeeD tries
[10:51:10] <djQuery> Wiz_KeeD: http://tinyurl.com/3hsk6j9
[10:52:50] <Engin> '+=' is quite helpful in animation(), but can we make a cap for it ? i.e. no less than 0
[10:53:30] <Phil`> djQuery, the markup validates perfectly :S
[10:53:44] <djQuery> jsfiddle.net
[10:53:46] <Wiz_KeeD> apparently it fails djQuery

[10:57:32] <Phil`> djQuery, I was just testing - I need the table which contains the clicked link
[10:57:39] <Phil`> alert($(this).parents('table').length);
[10:58:35] <djQuery> ok so if they remove a server you want to add it back to the select
[10:58:38] <djQuery> right?

[11:00:29] <djQuery> Phil` its a problem with your order of operations.
[11:00:44] <Phil`> djQuery, how so?

[11:26:36] <ccmonster> ?
[11:26:44] <metap0d> m4xx: Would a view of my source help at all? ;o

[11:28:13] <ccmonster> oksushi, but how do I show the NEXT N number of elements
[11:28:19] <djQuery> ccmonster: hmmm kinda stuck from there
[11:28:27] <TC_> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/wTxFhKwp and I'm using it like... $.initialize({id : '3'});
[11:28:28] <TC_> whats wrong with it?

[11:31:34] <ccmonster> hmm..
[11:31:41] <ccmonster> there are 5 shows, i want to show the next five
[11:31:54] <m4xx> metap0d, you had said to post source of my problematic code
[11:32:10] <TC_> Ah. fixed it. $.initialize instead of $.fn.initialize
[11:32:12] <m4xx> perhaps some mis-communication
[11:32:15] <metap0d> m4xx: Oh lol :D
[11:32:23] <metap0d> m4xx: yes one moment.
[11:32:28] <abjorn> unf
[11:32:40] <djQuery> m4xx: it seems to be working correctly to me
[11:32:47] <m4xx> in firefox yes
[11:32:48] <m4xx> not in IE
[11:33:00] <djQuery> well it works in chrome as well then
[11:33:01] <m4xx> sorry, i should have also put that in the comment
[11:33:25] <djQuery> m4xx: have you tried just using this.checked?
[11:34:03] <metap0d> brb
[11:35:18] <m4xx> djQuery, same result. i need both physically clicking the box and calling the click method to return the same result

[11:43:32] <chaw> hehe
[11:44:01] <unitials> Is there a way of getting height() which will simply return 0 if the element is not being displayed? Jquery is being too smart for my purposes here.
[11:44:38] <Anitox> .css('height');
[11:45:28] <ccmonster> hmm, the visible returns true
[11:45:35] <ccmonster> i need to get the index of the last element in the list that is visible
[11:46:08] <Anitox> :visible
[11:46:26] <ccmonster> that's just a true
[11:46:33] <ccmonster> .is(":visible")
[11:46:54] <ccmonster> $('#results ul li').is(':visible') will give me a true/false
[11:47:28] <ccmonster> i need an array, or list of the elements which are, then get the index of the last visible, so I can show the next N elements
[11:47:34] <unitials> Anitox: Nope. The element has a CSS height of 41, but its container is display none. Cant just query the container Im afraid. Need to know that the element is occupying 0px on the screen.

[11:53:10] <unitials> Aha. $('#id:visible').height() || 0
[11:53:14] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: $('.group:visible').last()
[11:54:21] <eddiemonge> Fretta: does jQuery('#name').val() get the value?
[11:55:14] <ravenz_> Fretta have you more than one element with #name id on your DOM?
[11:55:15] <ravenz_> http://jsfiddle.net/KC2Bz/
[11:56:03] <Fretta> eddiemonge I believe it gets and also sets
[11:56:38] <Fretta> ravenz_ will try now thnx
[11:56:41] <eddiemonge> Fretta: no, im asking if you do that, does it get the value for your specific case. in  other words, like ravenz_ is hinting at, are you actually targeting the right thing
[11:56:50] <abjorn> where my wigglaz at?

[11:57:01] <Raverix> ...
[11:57:07] <iEatChildren> can anyone assist me with the colorbox plugin?
[11:58:47] <eddiemonge> iEatChildren: if there was a question possibly
[11:58:51] <Whirl3d> Is this bad form?    var id=item.attr("id")||item.closest("['id']").attr('id')||item;
[11:59:26] <iivvoo> perhaps an odd question but.. is there a way to access a specific header in the "current" page? Eg. the one that's loaded and probably executing the javascript (vs. something explicitly gotten through some xhr call)?
[11:59:29] <iEatChildren> eddiemonge: can i private message you?
[11:59:44] <iivvoo> I mean an http header, like content-type
[12:00:01] <eddiemonge> iEatChildren: no
[12:00:15] <na3r> how can i change address bar with ajax request
[12:00:29] <Raverix> Whirl3d: Your code is ugly, there's only one excuse for it, you're trying to optimize greatly for file size.
[12:00:37] <iEatChildren> fair enough. my the issue im running in to is that when i click the image it colorbox opens but it never loads the image in to colorbox
[12:00:59] <Raverix> Whirl3d: If that's the goal, then there's no purpose in asking for good form, you're sacrificing form for file size.
[12:01:04] <ravenz_> na3r change address bar with ajax?
[12:02:17] <Whirl3d> raverix, thanks for the reply (I think)....I have a basic script that decodes id's passed to it and I would like to, on occasion, pass the element, not it's id to the function. So rather than a bunch of typing to dermine if it received an element or a string, I thought maybe the ugly script above would work.
[12:02:46] <eddiemonge> iEatChildren: is the image actually opening? what does firebug say?
[12:02:53] <k_89> na3r, u shouldn't and most probably can't, what u can do is make a timed url reader which detects changes in url and calls appropriate functions according to urls state
[12:02:57] <na3r> ravenz_, no i mean when user clicks on a link ajax request the data and address bar will change. somthing like hash but i wanna whole of adress begin change
[12:03:04] <na3r> sorry for my english
[12:03:09] <Raverix> Whirl3d: Code Readability is important to maintain and debug code.
[12:03:15] <Raverix> You're eliminating it left and right.
[12:03:29] <iEatChildren> eddiemonge: firebug doesnt throw any errors. Im wondering if its not working simple because im changing the src of said picture based on what thumnail the user clicks
[12:03:32] <ravenz_> you can't edit the address
[12:03:37] <Raverix> Whirl3d: This is fine if you're optimizing for filesize.
[12:03:38] <ravenz_> for security purpose
[12:03:43] <k_89> na3r, u can't change the address of page
[12:03:46] <abjorn> bot-t has been MIA a lot lately :(
[12:03:54] <Raverix> Whirl3d: But for other purposes, you should be using more standard form.
[12:04:07] <eddiemonge> iEatChildren: dont just check for errors. look at the net tab and see if the image loads or if it 404s
[12:04:10] <na3r> k_89, do u have any suggestion?
[12:04:27] <iEatChildren> eddiemonge: let me check again
[12:04:29] <k_89> na3r, read my second last post
[12:04:45] <k_89> one b4 "u can't change..."
[12:04:50] <ravenz_> na3r you can get that hash with ajax and then...redirect to /something.php?hash=freshajaxedhash
[12:04:53] <Whirl3d> Raverix, the function is so simple:  var name=id.split("_")[0]; where the name of my object is separated from it's class identifier by an "_"
[12:05:07] <luchenbill> how could I go about using jquery to change the z-index of these containers? http://jsfiddle.net/eSB8C/
[12:05:42] <ravenz_> luchenbill in which cases?
[12:05:59] <iEatChildren> eddiemonge: no errors
[12:06:02] <Whirl3d> Raverix, thanks for the feedback. I will keep it in mind.
[12:06:05] <eddiemonge> link then?
[12:06:07] <ravenz_> luchenbill oh on click?
[12:06:33] <iEatChildren> eddiemonge: can i pm you the link?
[12:06:50] <k_89> luchenbill,  $(selector).css({'z-index':'whatever'}); read docs on click
[12:06:54] <eddiemonge> iEatChildren: yes
[12:07:30] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[12:07:30] <ravenz_> luchenbill what's your purpose? maybe z-index is not really what you need
[12:07:48] <ravenz_> llo wkmanire
[12:10:37] <na3r> k_89, i read it. can u give me a link that describes the solution
[12:11:01] <k_89> na3r wait a sec
[12:11:11] <Raverix> ns3r All he's using is the css function...
[12:11:55] <na3r> Raverix, css function? what do u mean?

[12:13:00] <Raverix> finbrein: Make an entire website.
[12:13:16] <finbrein> what kind of site?
[12:13:22] <progme> finbrein: an awesome one
[12:13:26] <Raverix> ^
[12:13:34] <k_89> finbrein, one with mashups of public data and google maps etc
[12:13:35] <finbrein> can you give an example like url
[12:13:45] <Raverix> http://www.akqa.com/
[12:13:47] <Raverix> Make that.
[12:14:02] <ravenz_> finbrein have you got php skills too?
[12:14:18] <finbrein> I'm familiar
[12:14:36] <k_89> na3r, if you just want to show one div and hide others, then don't use z-index
[12:14:40] <wkmanire> finbrein: Better to be an expert at a few things than familiar with a hundred when you're just starting out.
[12:14:48] <ravenz_> do you work for free? :d i should complete one website but i'm so lazy and busy
[12:15:10] <Raverix> wkmanire: Better to be an expert at a hundred than with a few.
[12:15:25] <wkmanire> Raverix: he he.
[12:15:30] <progme> finbrein: make a chat client in javascript
[12:15:40] <progme> then make a chat client that connects to irc
[12:15:41] <Raverix> Chat client is bullshit.
[12:15:47] * wkmanire is using freenod web IRC.
[12:15:47] <progme> it's a start....
[12:15:50] <Raverix> How often do you have to build that?
[12:15:56] <ravenz_> finbrein make an online music player with both youtube and last.fm APIs
[12:15:56] <progme> never
[12:16:03] <Raverix> Show an employer you have all the abilities to make a high-end site.
[12:16:09] <Simplicity> Make a Hello World!!
[12:16:10] <Raverix> That's the skills they want to hire for/
[12:16:14] <progme> if that's what you want to do forever
[12:16:22] <progme> i would prefer to make chat clients
[12:16:26] <progme> then high end websites
[12:16:54] <finbrein> it's a big problem for me - I'm gonna graduate next month and i feel should start doing programming stuff but there are too many technologies out there that i'm not 100% ready for and  i'm a bit confused what specifi technology to focus on
[12:17:08] <wkmanire> finbrein: That won't stop
[12:17:11] <wkmanire> finbrein: Ever.
[12:17:12] <Raverix> Valid argument... if you're going into web application development, a chat app is a valid project.
[12:17:18] <progme> finbrein: do what draws your attention...
[12:17:28] <amybunny> become an intern. If that doesn't crush your soul, then keep on trucking?
[12:17:51] <ravenz_> don't worry amybunny is right, an intern will help you
[12:17:58] <finbrein> no chance to become an intern , straight to work now
[12:18:19] <Raverix> finbrein: Just become an expert in ASP/VB/C#/PHP/Java/HTML/XML/CSS/JavaScript/Flash/AS3, and you'll be fine.
[12:18:25] <progme> lol
[12:18:39] <progme> Raverix: python/sql server/oracle/mysql

[12:19:00] <finbrein> who should i follow
[12:19:06] <progme> oh and cisco
[12:19:19] <Whirl3d> Raverix, good lookin' site you listed earlier
[12:19:23] <Raverix> And Perl, apache, nginx...

[12:19:45] <Raverix> IIS
[12:19:49] <amybunny> ^-- +vi, advanced bash scripting, and the pits of the damned known as 'user support'?
[12:19:56] <ravenz_> muhahu iis is a must.
[12:20:11] <progme> oh yes
[12:20:12] <progme> web servers
[12:20:16] <Raverix> finbrein: Welcome to web development... I hope you like learning new technologies.
[12:20:21] <Raverix> Because that's the only constant here.
[12:20:22] <progme> lol
[12:20:22] <ravenz_> finbrein nah...you should choose what you would do.
[12:20:24] <jonkri> what handler can i use to run a function whenever an iframe has reloaded?
[12:20:32] <finbrein> web and mobile i prefer
[12:20:33] <jonkri> or function
[12:20:36] <amybunny> ooh, lotus notes! Don't forget lotus notes!
[12:20:44] <Raverix> Fuck  lotus notes.
[12:20:45] * wkmanire sighs.
[12:20:55] <ravenz_> i have to go bye
[12:21:09] <Whirl3d> bye ravenz_
[12:21:25] <Simplicity> finbrein: Android development
[12:21:26] <progme> Wordpress!
[12:21:29] <progme> you must learn wordpress!
[12:21:32] <wkmanire> jonkri: Thats actually pretty tough. One way to do it is to have the loaded page call a function.
[12:21:33] <progme> i hope i dont get banned
[12:21:45] <jonkri> wkmanire, ah, nice. thanks :)
[12:22:07] <amybunny> Android dev is actually a pretty interesting one to get into, I'd think. I mean, anything that competes against Apple is good by my books.
[12:22:21] <progme> finbrein: your best bet is to start a minecraft server business
[12:22:30] <progme> figure out AWS and how to deploy server instances quickly
[12:22:33] <progme> and cheaply
[12:22:41] <Raverix> lol
[12:22:50] <Simplicity> Sell cheap virtual machines
[12:22:51] <progme> annnnd go
[12:22:57] <wkmanire> you guys quit
[12:22:58] <wkmanire> jeese
[12:23:00] <progme> lol
[12:23:04] <Raverix> Indeed, we didn't touch any frameworks or CMS options...
[12:23:17] <progme> this conversation is making me depressed
[12:23:20] <Simplicity> wkmanire: My second suggestion concerning android development was legit.
[12:23:22] <progme> we are just listing things that i know nothing of
[12:23:26] <progme> other than the name
[12:23:39] <progme> my brain is too small
[12:23:40] <Raverix> progme: Really? I thought we were comparing skill sets...
[12:24:02] <wkmanire> finbrein: You're going to just need to go out and tell some white lies and bite off a little more than you can chew and then make sure come out swimming.
[12:24:17] <wkmanire> finbrein: They paycheck will dictate what technologies you need to learn.
[12:24:21] <finbrein> lol
[12:24:32] <Raverix> finbrein: Where do you want your career to go?
[12:24:40] <progme> that way.
[12:24:42] <finbrein> web and mobile
[12:24:43] * progme points up
[12:24:44] <wkmanire> make sure you are solid on core technologies like HTTP protocol, HTML, CSS and Javascript
[12:24:51] <Raverix> Learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript through and through.
[12:24:56] <wkmanire> The rest will come
[12:25:04] <progme> that's what she said
[12:25:06] <Raverix> Add a serverside language (I'd suggest PHP to get started)
[12:25:11] <systemfault> wkmanire: Few people are solid on HTTP
[12:25:30] <amybunny> Ive also heard that taking on software dev/maintenance is akin to signing away your soul - be sure to say good bye to the sun and your loved ones. You might get to see them in 5 years, if they let you off perma on-call.
[12:25:31] <systemfault> For pretty much everyone I know, it's still arcane magic.
[12:25:45] <Simplicity> amybunny: lol
[12:25:49] <wkmanire> systemfault: I know. Platform "X" makes it hard for people to learn it by abstracting away the details. Text in, text out. simple
[12:25:51] <biodegabriel> Hey all, I'm debugging a plugin that works with 1.2.6 but fails on 1.6.1, and I'm a bit stumped. what I know thus far is that there's something wrong with the timer implementation. Can someone please have a look and see why 1.6.1 wouldn't like this? http://pastie.org/1923159
[12:26:09] <jonkri> wkmanire, is there some way that function can be on the page containing the iframe?
[12:26:12] <biodegabriel> Is it a scope inheritance issue?
[12:26:21] <finbrein> thanks guyz
[12:26:22] <amybunny> We had this group, we'd virtually live out of a pub with wifi, no lies.
[12:26:57] <amybunny> booze + food + laptops = code monkey.
[12:27:13] <Raverix> amybunny: Don't act like that wasn'
[12:27:15] <Raverix> t awesome.
[12:27:25] <wkmanire> jonkri: Are you loading into the iframe content frmo the same domain?
[12:27:28] <systemfault> amybunny: Hmm, i'd replace booze with <insert source of caffeine here>
[12:27:33] <finbrein> exit
[12:27:47] <jonkri> wkmanire, yes. i'm doing a non-page-reloading file upload
[12:27:53] <Raverix> systemfault: You no longer have to choose between caffeine and alcohol, you can mix the two together!
[12:28:07] <blueadept> what's the trend in jquery right now?
[12:28:18] <ajpiano> using it
[12:28:19] <blueadept> thinking about doing a front page slider
[12:28:20] <amybunny> Raverix, at times, yeah. it was pretty awesome. But there was also times where you just wanted to go and do something other than sleep.
[12:28:27] <systemfault> Raverix: Not sure I'd like the feeling.. i heard about vodka+red bull in the past, never tried it though
[12:28:28] <wkmanire> jonkri: Whats that?
[12:28:50] <finbrein> passport hi
[12:29:00] <amybunny> systemfault, jager bombs, rev, rockstar, monster, beer is an energy drink too, right?
[12:29:05] <jonkri> wkmanire, i want to post a form to upload a file without reloading the current page, and the only way that i've found to do that is using an iframe
[12:29:11] <Raverix> amybunny: I just left a job that was like that... 60 hour weeks was a light week
[12:29:15] <Engin> is there a more abstract form of animate ? that I can feed a function to it... such as animate( function(val){ } ) where it will feed the function with val with the computed eased value ?
[12:29:31] <wkmanire> jonkri: Ah yes, familiar with this issue. I think there are some plugins you can use that will really help you
[12:29:37] <Engin> I want to update the position of a slider during animating something
[12:29:40] <Raverix> amybunny: New job is back to the 40s, so I'm happy... hopefully that stays.
[12:29:41] <amybunny> Raverix, and overtime = lol
[12:29:48] <wkmanire> jonkri: No need to reinvent the wheel here, unless you are doing this as a learning exercise.
[12:30:04] <jonkri> wkmanire, ok thanks :)
[12:30:05] <biodegabriel> Actually, forget it, I think i'm getting closer to figuring out what it is.
[12:30:08] <Raverix> amybunny: Actually, towards the end, I told them I wasn't going to do it, and they offered to pay me freelance rates.
[12:30:24] <wkmanire> jonkri: http://www.uploadify.com/demos/
[12:30:35] <Raverix> So I'd do my 40 hour weeks, come in on the weekend and bust out a website start to finish in two 15 hour days, and get a nice fat check.
[12:31:12] <amybunny> It's a pretty good lifestyle if you've got friends in the industry and you're not crashing too hard from lack of sleep/free time.
[12:32:10] <Raverix> Yeah, I was crashing pretty hard...
[12:32:15] <Raverix> Missing my wife + daughter.
[12:32:19] <Joric> noticed slideToggle in ie blinks in the very end is it fixable? like it shows the entire div for a several milliseconds right after hiding
[12:32:59] <c0dy> In a scenario where I alter existing static html, can I add a condition to a selector, like "only do this if a h1 in another div contains xxx"? So that $("div.content-navigation span:contains('MyText')").parent().unbind('click')... would only be only used if #headline h1 contains xxx, but not yyy?
[12:33:48] <BG> ui.dialog displays below youtube embed on IE, but okay on other browsers. how to fix it?
[12:33:55] <c0dy> So usually it should unbind.. but not on one page with that "h1"?
[12:35:20] * amybunny recalls the days of yore, with OS/2 and fledgling linux distros.
[12:35:54] <ColKurtz> Joric, which version of IE, and do you have an example?
[12:36:47] <Raverix> amybunny: Female IT people didn't exist back then.
[12:37:08] <ColKurtz> c0dy, can you add a class name instead of looking for the text? or have the special text inside a <span> or something? that would make it easier.
[12:39:05] <KWhat_Work> where are the items like contains defined for functions like  .find(":contains('t')")
[12:39:12] <KWhat_Work> is there an api for that ?
[12:39:27] <craq> i have an $('selector').each and inside my function for it, i have a call to $(this).parents('li'). I just recently got this site upgraded to jquery 1.5.2 and was running an older version that this code was ok with. now for some reason the parents() call returns nothing. if i remove the 'li' i still get nothing. if i change parents() to parent() i get window. how does that make sense?
[12:39:37] <craq> im using firebug and the debugger.
[12:39:45] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:39:52] <craq> this at that point clearly == the <a>
[12:40:01] <KWhat_Work> ahhh thanks
[12:40:48] <c0dy> ColKurtz: nope. I think I will wrap it in a if ($("#headline h1:contains('xx')")) { ..unbind() }
[12:41:05] <TeddyMurray> hi i have a grid and i want to make elements draggable within the grid to snap to the cells, how would one accomplish this?
[12:41:20] <TeddyMurray> can i use delegate to make all of the grid cells droppable?
[12:41:39] <ColKurtz> oh huh
[12:41:43] <ColKurtz> i didn't know about contains()
[12:41:48] <jaggz> I code in C and Perl mostly.. what should I use for the server-side for a jQuery site?
[12:41:54] <ColKurtz> i thought you were talking about it theoretically, like you wish there was a function like that
[12:41:55] <ColKurtz> haha
[12:41:58] <c0dy> ColKurtz: it rocks
[12:42:01] <c0dy> :-)
[12:42:04] <ajpiano> jaggz: anything, it doesn't matter
[12:42:22] <ajpiano> if you can output html in C and Perl then you can use jQuery on it
[12:42:33] <jaggz> nothing specifically designed to interact with jQuery?  (totally new to jquery)
[12:42:43] <c0dy> ColKurtz: There is also .not() in combination with contains, but no ".and()"
[12:42:56] <ajpiano> jaggz: jQuery is a client side library
[12:43:06] <c0dy> ColKurtz: Thanks anyway. Works now with the extra if ()
[12:43:07] <ajpiano> it works on rendered HTML in the DOM
[12:43:32] <ColKurtz> jaggz, for the server side you can use PHP, Ruby, Python, whatever floats your boat
[12:44:06] <TeddyMurray> hi i have a grid and i want to make elements draggable within the grid to snap to the cells, how would one accomplish this?
[12:44:07] <TeddyMurray> can i use delegate to make all of the grid cells droppable?
[12:44:08] <ColKurtz> jaggz,  If you want to play with serverside js check out Node.js
[12:45:35] <jaggz> nooo .. no thanks.. I'll leave the js on the client side
[12:45:50] <jaggz> but I do want the boat to float and move well.
[12:46:07] * jaggz looks at Teddy, hmm
[12:46:13] <ajpiano> you probably shouldn't write off nodejs if the first thing you're hearing about it is just now - on the other hand, it's proably not appropriate for what yo'ure trying to do
[12:46:50] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: you won't be able to use delegate with jquery ui's draggable/droppable
[12:47:01] <TeddyMurray> D:
[12:47:04] <jaggz> goodpoint.. looking at node.js
[12:47:15] <Joric> <ColKurtz> Joric, which version of IE, and do you have an example? i've found a solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111407/how-do-you-fix-the-flickering-that-occurs-when-you-use-slidetoggle-in-jquery
[12:47:18] <TeddyMurray> then how can i make the grid cells droppable ajpiano ?
[12:47:46] <Joric> ColKurtz, ie6,ie7,ie8 whatever if element height has been set to 0 it flickers
[12:47:54] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: have you seen
[12:47:55] <ajpiano> http://blog.threedubmedia.com/2008/08/eventspecialdrop.html
[12:48:19] <ColKurtz> Joric, so you just needed a doctype?
[12:48:51] <Joric> yes i've added "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd" to the doctype and it stopped flickering
[12:49:53] <Joric> imo it should be rewriten to hide element right after it hits 1px height
[12:50:45] <jaggz> so.. if we have fields and want to update things on the server we just use standard POST or GET ?
[12:50:48] <Joric> maybe it's somewhere in the bug tracker already
[12:51:07] <jaggz> sorry.. I mean.. if we have some areas where a user can edit something to update something on the server...
[12:51:26] <ajpiano> jaggz: yes, you still use post and get
[12:51:35] <ajpiano> these can also be done via "ajax" but it still is doing standard posts and gets
[12:54:15] <Gates> Can someone help me
[12:54:16] <Gates> http://pastebin.com/9BvXsLiy
[12:54:45] <Gates> I have an ordered list, and in that list theres a div tag with a description , using a "more info" after each list item id like to show the (should be) hidden descriptions
[12:55:03] <Gates> whats wrong with the code, how can I make it so the "listdesc" is hidden default and shows upon clicking
[12:55:09] <Gates> I think I'm pretty close just a stupid mistake
[12:55:57] <TeddyMurray> wtf, can you not use resizable with draggable? when i try to resize it makes it really large
[12:56:16] <TeddyMurray> when i comment out the draggable it doesn't do that, works properly
[12:56:48] <vifo> are there any simple jquery plugins which implement a "jquery ui" like toolbar and are built on top of jquery ui?
[13:00:25] <BG> can I use .data() on a embed/object elements?
[13:01:21] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[13:01:39] <Guest98059> BG: technically yes, but some plugins are picky about what happens to its element and will mess it up
[13:01:51] <Guest98059> gah
[13:02:24] <BG> isn't data stored in the jquery namespace?
[13:02:42] <Cork[home]> not only
[13:02:48] <Cork[home]> if you add it in js, it is
[13:02:59] <Cork[home]> but you can add it through data- attributes too
[13:03:08] <BG> I do it in js
[13:03:11] <Cork[home]> if its only through the name space, it works just fine
[13:03:21] <BG> yet IE ignores it (on embed)
[13:03:37] <Cork[home]> that sounds wierd
[13:03:44] <BG> that's why I'm here :)
[13:03:56] <Cork[home]> not that i've ever tried it
[13:04:13] <Cork[home]> but all data does is use the object id from the element as a key for the store
[13:04:25] <Cork[home]> might be that ie replaces it or something
[13:04:51] <Cork[home]> BG: btw as far as i remember ie doesn't support embed
[13:05:03] <Cork[home]> only the object tag
[13:05:31] <BG> you sure? because I did $("object, embed") and it then typed the nodeName, and it said EMBED
[13:05:37] <BG> (but not OBJECT)
[13:05:56] <Cork[home]> yes, the element is in the dom, thats not what i meant :)
[13:06:19] <Cork[home]> i meant as far as i know you can't actaully do anything with embed elements in ie
[13:06:27] <BG> doesn't really matter, I use both tags in the html
[13:07:02] <Gates> how do u fix this? http://pastebin.com/9BvXsL/
[13:07:18] <Gates> http://pastebin.com/9BvXsLiy **
[13:07:18] <BG> but then when I spawn a ui.dialog, I need to hide the embeds on IE, otherwise they get on top of the dialog, so I want to store their original visibility state before I do that, so I use .data() but it doesn't seem to stick
[13:07:41] <TeddyMurray> http://magicfreelance.com/badar/schedule.html could someone tell me why i can't use draggable and resizable together? when i try to resize it makes it really big
[13:07:45] <Gates> i suck at this =[
[13:11:34] <Cork[home]> BG: haven't ever actually tried it, so can't help
[13:11:39] <lastent> Hi, here http://pastebin.com/X3htHPTb at line 13 I want to I want to refer to the selectedlist of the SearchForm, how can I access to that?
[13:11:43] <BG> thanks cork
[13:11:44] <srj55> what's the correct syntax if I have:    row.find('*[id$="country"]').attr("id")      and I want to use this ID for:    $(#id).change(...)   ?
[13:12:45] <Cork[home]> srj55: you would have to do that in a loop if you get more then one result from that
[13:12:52] <ajpiano> srj55: you don't need to get the id and then assign a change handler
[13:13:02] <ajpiano> you can just do row.find("whatever").change(function(e) { });
[13:13:14] <Cork[home]> heh, ya even better XD
[13:15:32] <srj55> ajpiano: thanks.  Maybe there's a better way than using ('*[id$="country"]')   ?   it's for a dynamic formset and I know that the ID will be of the form id_locations-X-country   where X is a number 0 to 100
[13:15:47] <Gates> Cork[home]: wanna hlep me quick
[13:15:53] <Gates> im sure u can look at it and tell me whats missing
[13:16:27] <ajpiano> srj55: it would be best to put a class on it
[13:17:33] <srj55> ajpiano: yeah, it's being generated by an app that doesn't have a class associated, and I cannot add one unfortunately.
[13:17:59] <ajpiano> srj55: well it would be much better to include  the tagname (input) and then yes, do the id search
[13:18:09] <biodegabriel> http://pastie.org/1923159 I'm rewriting an old plugin, and I'm stuck at this point in the plugin: "$().mousemove(function(mouse){...." 1.2.6 and 1.6.1 interpret it differently. Can anyone give me a hint? I'd like to re-write this part so that 1.6.1 accepts it. http://pastie.org/1923159
[13:18:12] <Gates> how would u hide a short description under each list item with a "show" button at the end
[13:18:33] <srj55> ajpiano: ok thanks
[13:19:14] <biodegabriel> oh wait. forget about it. i think i need to read more docs. :D
[13:21:46] <lastent> Hi, here (http://pastebin.com/tACiqMCf) in line 11 how can I access the selectedlist?
[13:21:58] <dtach> hi im getting an error in IE8 which stops my script from work, any other browser (of course) is just fine and i get absolutely no error in any of them (firebug/console)
[13:22:03] <dtach> the line in question is, open = '#' + $(this).attr('id') + 'Pop';
[13:23:16] <dtach> "object doesnt support this action"
[13:26:23] <ColKurtz> dtach, did you declare that variable?
[13:26:30] <ColKurtz> var open = '#' +...
[13:26:40] <dtach> tried that
[13:26:48] <ColKurtz> how about
[13:26:58] <ColKurtz> var open = $(this).attr('id');
[13:27:13] <ColKurtz> open = '#'+ open + 'Pop';
[13:27:45] <dtach> ok now that did
[13:27:48] <dtach> thanks
[13:27:51] <ColKurtz> sure
[13:27:57] <ColKurtz> curious error though huh?
[13:28:24] <dtach> think its the only variable i dont have var in front of (well do now)
[13:28:42] <dtach> didnt know it was so picky
[13:28:47] <ColKurtz> yeah you should declare your vars
[13:31:17] <tmedema> Anyone here could tell me how to properly use jquery with require.js now that the two are no longer bundled? Something like https://gist.github.com/979473 does not seem to function for me.
[13:31:24] <lastent> Hi ColKurtz can you help me? here (http://pastebin.com/tACiqMCf) I need to acces to selectedlist from line 11
[13:33:16] <ColKurtz> umm not too sure what the question is lastent. also it would be easier to help on http://jsfiddle.net
[13:36:42] <lastent> ColKurtz, I don't understand jsfiddle.net very well. See I created a SearchForm "class" and an attribute would be the selectedlist, so inside the bind I want to access selectedlist
[13:37:04] <ColKurtz> lastent, jsfiddle is really easy to use, and very useful
[13:37:09] <ColKurtz> just think of it as an in-browser IDE
[13:37:20] <ColKurtz> with separate panes for editing CSS, JS, and HTML
[13:37:27] <ColKurtz> and you can also add resources (JS or CSS files)
[13:37:55] <ColKurtz> and you can choose libraries to use with your 'fiddle' as well, like jQuery
[13:38:09] <ColKurtz> try messing around with it and learn how to use it, it will serve you well in this channel
[13:39:03] <lastent> ok ColKurtz, I'll try it
[13:39:22] <lastent> ColKurtz, can you still help me with my question please
[13:40:14] <ColKurtz> sorry lastent i have to run to lunch right now...but set it up on jsfiddle.net
[13:40:30] <ColKurtz> that way people can see what's wrong when they try to use it
[13:40:31] <lastent> ok thanks ColKurtz
[13:40:41] <ColKurtz> and they can edit it right there to try and fix it
[13:41:28] <ColKurtz> also doesn't have ads like pastebin :P
[13:42:48] <Engin> any quick ways to determine which string comes first alphabetically ?
[13:43:08] <Engin> like strcmp
[13:44:01] <Engin> holy shit
[13:44:07] <Engin> <> works apparenly
[13:46:33] <pedrobelo> guys, any insights on response streaming with jquery? I have an API where the server keeps the connection open
[13:46:49] <pedrobelo> would like to just open a connection to it and show data as it's received
[13:51:38] <ch3mical> pedrobelo: I'm not sure that's possible using jQuery, you would probably have to code that in straight JS
[13:53:28] <JeffJassky> Hey, guys. I'm using jQuery UI / Draggables using the 'clone' helper. I'm trying to use some of the event callbacks and target specifically the CLONE ONLY and not the original object.. so far I'm not having any luck.
[13:54:55] <bluekite2000> can i display a random message using jquery without refreshing my page?
[13:55:58] <ngharo> uh yeah
[13:57:36] <bluekite2000> any tutorial i can check out?
[13:58:58] <ngharo> that's like jquery basics.  http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[14:00:55] <ch3mical> heh
[14:01:07] <JquerySadist> How do I find an element that's a parent an unknown number of levels up?
[14:01:18] <JquerySadist> (But I know its class)
[14:01:37] <ch3mical> $(this).parent('element.class')
[14:01:44] <ch3mical> Should drill up
[14:01:50] <vrtigo> $(this).closest('.derp')
[14:02:49] <ccmonster> how do I show items with an index >x
[14:02:53] <ccmonster> inside a list
[14:03:41] <ch3mical> ccmonster: see ?nth-child()
[14:03:51] <ch3mical> No bot
[14:03:58] <ch3mical> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[14:04:35] <JquerySadist> closest wil dril up too?
[14:04:39] <vrtigo> yes
[14:04:45] <vrtigo> thats what its designed for
[14:05:35] <ch3mical> I think vrtigo's answer is more accurate
[14:05:51] <wizbit> anybody recommend any books for a beginner?
[14:06:01] <JquerySadist> My web app is so fucked if someone uses IE 7 :(
[14:06:12] <vrtigo> good, make them upgrade
[14:06:40] <ccmonster> i have 10 li's on load, i have a b utton, and upon click i want to show the next N elements
[14:06:44] <ccmonster> that's what im tryin gto achiefve
[14:07:04] <wizbit> JquerySadist: why dont you code a warning so the app doesnt run on ie7
[14:07:45] <Engin> looks like ff4 doesn't like .css({backgroundPositionX... and Y
[14:09:33] <JquerySadist> If the only purpose of my anchor/hyperlink is to trigger a Javascript event, is it okay to set href as href=""?
[14:10:29] <ch3mical> JquerySadist: Set it to anything you like, but in the event you probably want to add a call to .preventDefault() to prevent it acting like a link
[14:11:06] <pr0ton> hi guys
[14:11:07] <ch3mical> so $('#myanchor').live('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); .... });
[14:11:09] <pr0ton> i'm a bit stuck here
[14:11:13] <pr0ton> anybody used codemirror before?
[14:11:30] <ch3mical> pr0ton: familiar with it, haven't used it
[14:11:31] <pr0ton> http://codemirror.net/manual.html#config
[14:11:39] <pr0ton> can you see the onChange function?
[14:11:41] <pr0ton> how do you write that?
[14:11:53] <pr0ton> i've got { onChange : function(instance) { ... } }
[14:11:59] <pr0ton> but instance is being shown as undefined
[14:12:07] <pr0ton> i dunno what that line out there means
[14:12:22] <pr0ton> When given, this function will be called every time the content of the editor is changed. It will be given the editor instance as only argument.
[14:12:25] <JquerySadist> ch3mical: Alright
[14:12:47] <JquerySadist> What do you guys typical use for href=""?
[14:12:55] <ch3mical> pr0ton: how do you know anything is being passed to the function?
[14:13:01] <vrtigo> ccmonster: $('.container').not(':visible').each(function(idx, obj) { if (idx < 10) $(obj).show(); });
[14:13:11] <ch3mical> Oh nevermind
[14:13:14] <vrtigo> that should work
[14:13:21] <ch3mical> I didn't read the whole sentence ;)
[14:15:08] <ch3mical> pr0ton: are you setting it in CodeMirror function or in the fromTextArea method?
[14:15:09] <ccmonster> vrtigo, that's awesome, but i also want to get the ones that are showing.
[14:15:21] <ccmonster> so just sort of flip it, this should be good to work with. thanks
[14:15:32] <vrtigo> what do you mean by "get"?
[14:15:40] <ch3mical> ccmonster: change .not to .is
[14:15:41] <pr0ton> fromTextArea takes the second param as a dict
[14:15:42] <vrtigo> if they are visible on the page, they will stay visible
[14:16:16] <ccmonster> yea.
[14:16:37] <ch3mical> pr0ton: says they both do
[14:17:02] <pr0ton> hmm yeah
[14:17:06] <ccmonster> the sweetest effect (since this is a list), would be to slide the results up into the visible container that werent previously visible, and the visible ones up to out of frame
[14:17:09] <ccmonster> if that makes sense
[14:17:24] <vrtigo> right ok
[14:17:35] <ccmonster> not sure how to go about it
[14:17:36] <vrtigo> forget the slide for now, work on showing/hiding
[14:17:41] <ccmonster> yea.
[14:17:53] <ccmonster> just not sure how I would slide some of the elements away, and others in
[14:17:55] <ch3mical> pr0ton: I can't really offer any more insight without seeing some code.. however I have to go for a few
[14:18:30] <vrtigo> what id do is keep a global var of the index of the currently visible first li
[14:18:36] <vrtigo> one sec brb
[14:18:50] <ccmonster> yea.
[14:21:44] <ccmonster> could i use the filter to effectively do it?
[14:24:13] <jinxdone> ccmonster, there should be not much to it
[14:25:05] <vrtigo> something like..
[14:25:06] <vrtigo> http://paste.ubuntu.com/609772/
[14:25:14] <Ontolog> why do the docs never have the answer that i am looking for? > . <
[14:25:30] <vrtigo> make that $('.container li')
[14:25:33] <Ontolog> i want some way to determine if an element exists in the document
[14:25:46] <vrtigo> um
[14:25:52] <Ontolog> $('#doesntexist') seems to return an object
[14:26:02] <vrtigo> Ontolog: $('element.class').length ?
[14:26:16] <ccmonster> floor. ..hmm
[14:26:17] <ccmonster> havent used that
[14:26:34] <vrtigo> floor/ceil are your friends, get to know them
[14:26:35] <Ontolog> vrtigo: the length of the css class of the element??
[14:27:00] <jinxdone> Ontolog; it returns an empty jquery object if nothing matches
[14:27:14] <jinxdone> $('#doesntexists').length == 0
[14:27:18] <Ontolog> i see
[14:27:19] <Ontolog> thank you
[14:27:41] <paul_irish> i have a jquery question
[14:27:49] <vrtigo> the docs dont cover that because its javascript, not jquery
[14:27:58] <vrtigo> paul_irish: get out
[14:28:13] <skamikaze> :P
[14:28:18] <paul_irish> would it be helpful to have something like jquerypluginboilerplate.com where it gives you the code and tips on writing an effective jquery plugin?
[14:28:44] <ajpiano> i wouldn't call it jquery plugin boilerplat
[14:28:53] <paul_irish> (someone else wants to make it and is asking me)
[14:29:01] <ccmonster> yea, it couldnt hurt
[14:29:02] <vrtigo> i would say yes
[14:29:18] <ajpiano> i think that person should contribute their efforts to the jquery learning site
[14:29:30] <ajpiano> making a website with 3 articles on it is like ???
[14:29:44] <skamikaze> paul_irish: there are a few good plugin development pages out there like http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[14:29:50] <ajpiano> and i'm not of the mind that there's a good "boilerplate" for jquery plugins that is more than like, 4 lines of code
[14:29:51] <paul_irish> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring <=
[14:29:55] <skamikaze> (but you maybe already knew that)
[14:30:55] <paul_irish> ajpiano: if i told homebooy to get involved with the learning site
[14:31:01] <paul_irish> whats the best way to do that
[14:31:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> what does (function(){ do?
[14:32:03] <paul_irish> throw a syntaxerror
[14:32:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> well i mean like
[14:32:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> i want to learn about some of the design patterns in js
[14:32:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> and i don't get what the plugin... code... stuff... does exactly
[14:32:41] <ajpiano> paul_irish: write some articles in .md, commit them to a fork of http://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com
[14:32:41] <vrtigo> oh boy

[14:41:48] <maikoool> i'm using jquery's $.post, can i also post files with my forms with this?
[14:42:12] <BlackArts> Hey, if I have some json file somewhere on the server, what would be the best way to call it with ajax and put it in a variable?
[14:42:39] <skamikaze> ?getJSON @ BlackArts
[14:42:40] <bot-t> BlackArts, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:42:58] <BlackArts> thanks
[14:43:26] <skamikaze> BlackArts: it caches the result, so maybe you want to use ajax directly
[14:43:40] <Kronuz> hello
[14:43:54] <Kronuz> hey, when was jsonp added to $.ajax?
[14:44:06] <skamikaze> Kronuz: 1.2.x
[14:44:09] <Kronuz> 'cause I see there's a jquery-jsonp plugin too
[14:44:17] <Kronuz> skamikaze: why is that needed then?
[14:44:24] <skamikaze> did i say that? :D
[14:44:39] <skamikaze> never heared of that plugin dude
[14:44:52] <skamikaze> maikoool: you can't send file contents by ajax
[14:45:08] <skamikaze> maikoool: there's swfupload e.g.
[14:45:10] <Kronuz> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
[14:47:07] <skamikaze> Kronuz: crossDomain(added 1.5)
[14:47:14] <skamikaze> => http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:47:38] <ccmonster> the next  didnt really work
[14:48:21] <BlackArts> but.. let's say I have data.json file stored on server, how would I load it with ajax without get method?
[14:48:56] <BlackArts> I just want to pull json file into the variable
[14:49:05] <ccmonster> ajax BlackArts
[14:49:13] <ccmonster> without get method?
[14:49:20] <ccmonster> do it server side.
[14:49:23] <skamikaze> BlackArts: fill it on the server side then
[14:49:29] <BlackArts> $.ajax({
[14:49:29] <BlackArts>   url: url,
[14:49:29] <BlackArts>   dataType: 'json',

[14:49:46] <ccmonster> or jsfiddle please
[14:51:10] <Kronuz> skamikaze: I'm using jsonp to get a long-polling resource …but I'm using that plugin I told you about
[14:51:13] <BlackArts> can I do it like this? $.ajax({url: 'http://server.com/data.json', dataType: 'json'});
[14:51:31] <Kronuz> …then I just realized jquery has jsonp support, so now I don't know why I'm not using that instead …

[14:53:39] <deinspanjer> I'd really appreciate a spot of help.  I'm trying to make a series of XHR requests and take an action after all three of them have completed.
[14:53:42] <Kronuz> ….I'm getting a "loading" icon in my browser all the time for some reason, and I can't get rid of it (chrome) …so I figure to revisit my code
[14:53:56] <Kronuz> but it seems the problem is only there in chrome
[14:54:14] <deinspanjer> Reading documentation on .ajax and Promise and such, it feels like this code should do what I want, but the final callback is firing before the results are in.
[14:54:19] <skamikaze> Kronuz: you maybe want to check out socket.io
[14:54:35] <deinspanjer> Here is my code: http://people.mozilla.com/~deinspanjer/ipv6day/test.html and http://people.mozilla.com/~deinspanjer/ipv6day/ipv6day.js
[14:54:42] <skamikaze> Kronuz: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO
[14:55:18] <deinspanjer> If anyone could take a look at that code and give me a tip on what I'm doing wrong, as I said, I'd really appreciate it.
[14:55:25] <KWhat_Work> I have var test = $(element).parent("div").after('<span/>');   What exactly is test?  I cant seem to do a .nodeName on it.
[14:56:07] <savid> What would be the reverse of $.param() ?    That is, I want to convert 'foo=bar&baz=qux' to {foo:'bar',baz:'quix'}?
[14:56:23] <broke> Hey might be off topic.
[14:56:25] <broke> http://i51.tinypic.com/eaoxon.png
[14:56:30] <broke> Any design tips?
[14:57:24] <KWhat_Work> ahhh test[0]
[14:57:45] <ngharo> savid: ?bbq has a deparam method
[14:57:50] <ngharo> ?bbq @ savid
[14:57:50] <bot-t> savid, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[14:58:10] <Kronuz> how is firefox 4?
[14:58:32] <Kronuz> …I started using chrome 'cause honestly it was faster …but haven't really checked at ff4
[14:58:36] <BlackArts> so... I have file on server file.json, and i have this inside that file: {'object1':'data1', 'object2':'data2'}, and than I try var section_elements = $.getJSON('file.json');, but when I try section_elements[1] I get undefined
[14:58:44] <BlackArts> am I doing something wrong
[14:58:46] <savid> yeah, don't want to use a whole new plugin just for that.  Just wondering if there's an easy way to do it natively in js or jquery
[14:58:53] <deinspanjer> savid: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-function-to-parse-query-string-from-url
[14:59:00] <ccmonster> console.log(section_elements[1]);
[14:59:22] <skamikaze> BlackArts: $.getJSON('file.json', function ( response ) { // go tiger
[14:59:28] <deinspanjer> Kronuz: Well, I like it, but I'm bias. :)
[14:59:52] <ccmonster> lol @ go tiger
[14:59:54] <BlackArts> won't work...
[15:00:01] <ccmonster> console.log is your friend
[15:00:03] <ccmonster> along with firebug
[15:00:03] <Kronuz> FF started to feel bloated at some point
[15:00:11] <BlackArts> I'm using chromes console
[15:00:21] <deinspanjer> savid: you could always use the $.map() method..
[15:00:26] <ccmonster> that should work as well
[15:00:26] <BlackArts> I know ot's my friend :P
[15:00:32] <skamikaze> deinspanjer: https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[15:00:34] <deinspanjer> Err.. sorry, not map, reverse
[15:00:57] <ccmonster> $.getJSON('file.json', function ( response ) { console.log("MY RESPONSE:",response);}
[15:01:35] * skamikaze preferred the tiger one
[15:01:36] <ngharo> savid: i guess you could split by &, then =, iterate over the array and build an object
[15:01:57] <ccmonster> and make sure you are targeting your json file correctly
[15:01:59] <ngharo> savid: i would just look at the bbq deparam source and pull relevant code out of it (and give props back)
[15:02:56] <ccmonster> bbq param is the bees knees
[15:03:55] <ngharo> savid: https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq/blob/master/jquery.ba-bbq.js#L466
[15:04:27] <BlackArts> can someone pleasy try to call this file into a variable and post me a code, cos I'm stupid today obviously
[15:04:28] <BlackArts> 195.28.181.223
[15:04:34] <deinspanjer> Anyone have any idea about my problem with executing a callback after 3 ajax calls complete?
[15:04:37] <BlackArts> http://195.28.181.223/mlijecni_proizvodi.json
[15:04:41] <BlackArts> link to the file
[15:05:00] <skamikaze> BlackArts: 404 Not Found
[15:05:01] <skamikaze> :D
[15:05:33] <deinspanjer> This is the test page again: http://people.mozilla.com/~deinspanjer/ipv6day/test.html
[15:05:34] <progrock> anyone know what option is called when dropped with jqueryUI sortble?
[15:05:52] <BlackArts> yep, I'm stupid today... here's the rightlink
[15:05:52] <BlackArts> http://195.28.181.223/~kululush/mlijecni_proizvodi.json
[15:06:32] <skamikaze> ?promise @ deinspanjer:
[15:06:33] <bot-t> deinspanjer:, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[15:07:26] <deinspanjer> skamikaze: Yep. I read lots of documentation on promise and deferred and the ajax events.. are you telling me that what I'm trying to do isn't possible?
[15:07:41] <BlackArts> have anyone succeded in retrieving my json file with ajax
[15:08:19] <progrock> nvm its update event
[15:08:33] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: it is possible with dfds
[15:08:41] <deinspanjer> I may just be a tiny bit dense, but I feel the definition given above doesn't really make it very clear.  The examples seem to show that using it with $.when().always() would let you invoke a callback after all the deferreds had completed
[15:08:41] <skamikaze> BlackArts: try to include jquery on that page..
[15:08:57] <skamikaze> deinspanjer: using a promise would solve your problem easy
[15:09:03] <BlackArts> I have jquery included on my page
[15:09:12] <BlackArts> I'm pulling to localhost
[15:09:13] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax()).then(function(a, b, c) { });
[15:09:16] <skamikaze> BlackArts: $ is undefined, jQuery is undefined
[15:09:18] <BlackArts> from a server
[15:09:28] <skamikaze> BlackArts: jsfiddle.net
[15:09:38] <BlackArts> I have my testing page on my pc, I'm pulling json file from that server
[15:09:46] <skamikaze> deinspanjer: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[15:09:52] <BlackArts> I have jquery included on my pc index htm
[15:10:13] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: That is basically what I was trying to do with the code linked above. the only real difference is that I am using a for loop to execute the ajax calls since I don't have a constant number of them.
[15:10:17] <skamikaze> BlackArts: chromium console says no
[15:10:57] <ajpiano> deinspanjer luckily i once made a demo that shows how to do this with an arbitrary unkown number of requests
[15:10:58] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/hGgcU/
[15:11:01] <ngharo> skamikaze: he linked to a json file...
[15:11:04] <BlackArts> how can you know that when the jQuery is on MY pc not on the server. I'm pulling json file to MY PC from a server
[15:11:12] <ngharo> BlackArts: you can't make cross site requests, so you cannot do that
[15:11:18] <BlackArts> argh
[15:11:25] <ngharo> read up on jsonp
[15:11:34] <skamikaze> BlackArts: same origin policy
[15:11:38] <BlackArts> and I can not request on local machine?
[15:11:48] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: in short, do an array of ajax calls, and then $.when.apply($, arrayofajaxcalls).then(fn);
[15:11:57] <ngharo> if viewing http://localhost, you can only make ajax calls to http://localhost
[15:12:19] <BlackArts> yes, I'm just trying that
[15:12:37] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: Hrm.. interesting, so the docs for when seemed to indicate you could pass an array of deferreds.. but that isn't the case?
[15:12:47] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: why the funky .apply call there?
[15:13:02] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: the docs are not indicating that you can pass an array of deferreds
[15:13:15] <ajpiano> they are indicating that you can pass an unlimited number of deferreds as arguments
[15:13:19] <ajpiano> to the $.when function
[15:13:28] <deinspanjer> oh.. I think I got the docs confused..
[15:13:29] <ajpiano> if you have an actual ARRAY of deferreds, you have to do $.when() aply
[15:13:44] <ajpiano> the reason for that is that you can pass ANYTHING to $.when(), including an array
[15:14:04] <deinspanjer> .when says multiple objects passed in.  Other handlers of deferreds such as the .ajax events can take an array. I just confused them.
[15:14:12] <ajpiano> aha yes
[15:14:14] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: okay, that seems to be what I need then. thanks!
[15:14:16] <BlackArts> OMFG! Just kill me! Origin http://127.0.0.1:8888 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[15:14:17] <ajpiano> no problemo!
[15:14:31] <necromancer`brb> in jQuery.validate...what's "depends:" for? is that for defining your own custom validator?
[15:14:37] <BlackArts> why can't I even do it on localhost
[15:14:57] <ngharo> because the internet said so
[15:15:41] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: Hrm.. it is 66.666% awesome.
[15:16:16] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: if you have just a minute more, could you look at this now? http://people.mozilla.com/~deinspanjer/ipv6day/test.html  Note that (for me at least) it seems to consistently fire after two of the three requests have finished.
[15:16:33] <BlackArts> ok... so finally on the server 		var section_elements = $.getJSON('mlijecni_proizvodi.json');
[15:16:41] <BlackArts> i still get undefined
[15:16:57] <BlackArts> when calling that object
[15:17:03] <BlackArts> http://195.28.181.223/~kululush/secret/
[15:17:07] <BlackArts> anyone?
[15:17:46] <TeddyMurray> does anyone know how to make draggable and resizable work on the same element? i think its a common bug
[15:17:50] <TeddyMurray> need a workaround
[15:19:21] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: try using a handle option for draggable
[15:19:30] <TeddyMurray> ok ill try, thanks ajpiano
[15:20:23] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: it's not immediately clear to me why that's happening
[15:20:37] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: well, at least it is happening to you too. :)
[15:20:59] <DukeDrake> hi
[15:21:06] <TeddyMurray> meh, same issue ajpiano
[15:21:15] <TeddyMurray> should i upload the code?
[15:21:16] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: it's not always the last one though for me
[15:21:30] <TeddyMurray> its resizing really huge, with one click
[15:21:34] <ch3mical> ?101 @ ProLoser|Mobile
[15:21:34] <deinspanjer> Yep. occasionally the second one.  haven't seen it be the first yet though

[15:22:01] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, http://magicfreelance.com/badar/schedule.html
[15:22:09] <ch3mical> Oops, my I was scrolled way back in my buffer
[15:22:10] <ch3mical> :)
[15:22:15] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: deinspanjer i'd look more but i'm unfortauntely out the door here gentlemen
[15:22:26] <TeddyMurray> all right, thanks anyway
[15:23:04] <DukeDrake> how can I get the actual 'current' data from a <select>, not the value?
[15:23:20] <ch3mical> o_O
[15:23:52] <ch3mical> Try option, not select
[15:24:06] <ch3mical> $('select option:selected')
[15:24:17] <ajpiano> deinspanjer: one last thing is you could just do var deferreds = $.map(ipv6dayData.tests, function(k,v) { return $.ajax()   })
[15:24:26] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquerys map methods
[15:24:26] <djQuery> $('select>option:selected')  ?

[15:24:41] <ajpiano> alright good luck with all your jqueries everybody
[15:24:47] <djQuery> hye bots back
[15:25:01] <DukeDrake> wtf
[15:25:28] <DukeDrake> $('#myselect').val() get me the currently selected value
[15:25:34] <DukeDrake> *gets
[15:25:53] <ch3mical> Are you sure?
[15:25:56] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: Ah, I didn't think of that. easy enough to try
[15:25:57] <DukeDrake> yes
[15:26:00] <ch3mical> How do you know?
[15:26:02] <DukeDrake> I'm positive
[15:26:08] <teear> hiv positive
[15:26:12] <DukeDrake> I'm using the value already
[15:26:18] <ch3mical> teear: *rimshot*
[15:26:21] <Zerxer> what do you mean 'current' data
[15:26:23] <necromancer> hmm
[15:26:36] <savid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran
[15:26:49] <savid> doh, sorry folks, wrong channel :)
[15:26:53] <DukeDrake> I just don't know how to acquire the currently visible text ...
[15:26:59] <ch3mical> .text()
[15:27:01] <teear> yep, we are not yanks
[15:27:08] <DukeDrake> well ... mayby
[15:27:14] <DukeDrake> I'll give it a shot
[15:27:15] <ch3mical> Definitely.
[15:27:19] <Zerxer> DukeDrake: $("#myselect option:selected").text()
[15:27:57] <teear> Maybe we need some oil in the middle east says yankee USA president
[15:27:59] <teear> maybe not
[15:28:23] <ajpiano> teear: what are you on about?
[15:28:42] <ch3mical> ajpiano: New jQuery method
[15:28:48] <TeddyMurray> how do you disable resizable horizontally?
[15:28:51] <ch3mical> ajpiano: .getOil()
[15:28:51] <teear> About the nuclear program of Iran
[15:28:51] <deinspanjer> ajpiano: Same behavior, but one more thing ruled out.  I saw you are headed out.  Thanks very much for the help so far.
[15:29:13] <teear> Come on this is Jquery channel, not a channel for some stupid yanks
[15:29:25] <ch3mical> $('#iran').getOil();
[15:29:56] <teear> That would be nice
[15:30:09] <Zerxer> getOil is undefined
[15:30:26] <ch3mical> Zerxer: it's the build for jQuery 1.8
[15:30:32] <ch3mical> :P
[15:30:33] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: didn't work
[15:30:42] <TeddyMurray> (function ($) { $.fn.getOil = function (opts) { }); }; }(jQuery));
[15:31:03] <teear> I once punced a americanny man with a punce in the dildodole
[15:31:10] <ajpiano> teear, yes, it's a jQuery channel, not a channel for out of context blathering
[15:31:36] <teear> so i should shut my self up
[15:31:41] <Zerxer> though there are americans here, despite you not being one, so your comment was wrong anyways
[15:31:42] <deinspanjer> interesting.. this code doesn't seem to work at all in 1.5.1 or 1.5.2
[15:31:53] <DukeDrake> Zerxer: did work
[15:31:57] <TeddyMurray> $("#teear").shut();
[15:31:58] <TeddyMurray> :)
[15:32:14] <ch3mical> $('#teear').remove(); :P
[15:32:29] <teear> My comment is wrong because i'm not a Merry Can
[15:32:40] <jonkri> i have a form with id abc123 and a submit button with id def456. how come $('#abc123').submit() or $('#def456').submit() does not submit the form?
[15:32:46] <ch3mical> Someone should make that a function in the bot to kick people... parameters passed in .remove() will be the kick message lol
[15:33:56] <ajpiano> teear: your comment is wrong becaue you haven't done anything except for say "hiv positive" and incoherently disparage americans since you've been talking
[15:34:32] <teear> I'm friends with many Merry Cans but mostly Merry Cans are not so clever
[15:35:18] <ch3mical> I'm friends with a lot of people that call themselves "teear", mostly they are stereotyping assholes :D
[15:35:26] <ch3mical> <3
[15:35:32] <teear> ah0eh0e
[15:36:45] <ajpiano> teear: as an american who has spent a great deal of time on IRC disparaging americans, i can safely say this is not the right venue for it
[15:37:07] <teear> yep, ok, wanna go for a beer?
[15:37:22] <ajpiano> i'd love to but i have to go to eat tapas, apparently
[15:37:33] <ajpiano> my gf is the social director
[15:37:34] <teear> tapas what's that
[15:37:42] <ajpiano> ?w Tapas
[15:37:43] <bot-t> ajpiano, Tapas - Tapas () is the name of a wide variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas
[15:37:46] <teear> some a merry can food?
[15:38:01] <teear> thats spanish food
[15:38:13] <teear> so you stole that one too, like the oil in iraq
[15:38:46] <ajpiano> ok so what i was doing was deciding whether or not you should be able to talk in here once i am not here, i think i'm gonna go with no :p
[15:38:55] <Zerxer> good call
[15:39:03] <jabley> I'm using jquery 1.5.2 and was hoping someone could help me understand some strange ajax behaviour
[15:39:06] <jabley> https://gist.github.com/979756
[15:39:08] <ajpiano> but you can try back again tomorrow!
[15:39:17] <Zerxer> that's why you wear the big pants
[15:39:22] <jabley> I'm don't understand why I'm getting the jsonp failure message?
[15:39:45] <muley> U
[15:39:46] <muley> S

[15:39:49] <muley> :D
[15:40:19] * gnarf lolz @ ajpiano
[15:41:03] <ch3mical> jabley: you should just regex filter out bad emails...
[15:41:24] <jabley> ch3mical: I do that on the server
[15:42:20] <jabley> I don't understand why ?? seems to trigger different behaviour and was hoping someone can point out what I'm doing wrong
[15:42:32] <ch3mical> jabley: you're going to have to encode the data then
[15:42:58] <heatxsink> so on ios using css3 hardware accelerated transitions cause nasty flickering, what does jquery mobile use?
[15:43:30] <ch3mical> jabley: it looks like ?? is being recognized as a JSONP callback. Encode the email address and that won't happen anymore (shouldn't)
[15:44:42] <jabley> ch3mical: can you point me at a fine manual to read?
[15:44:43] <amerrycan> oil in Iraq is stolen!
[15:45:38] <Zerxer> you're just making youself look a fool, no one cares man
[15:46:58] <muley> ty :P
[15:47:04] <Zerxer> might as well just ban teear if he's going to act like that
[15:47:09] <necromancer> is there a way to set up custom validators with jQuery.validate?
[15:47:14] <necromancer> custom rules*
[15:47:18] <necromancer> or am i stuck using their stock rules/
[15:47:27] <Aragon> http://jsfiddle.net/XAaXD/ what have i done wrong? it seems that my function "process" isnt called... even if i want to "alert" data it doesnt work
[15:47:45] <jabley> I thought jQuery took care of the encoding for me, so I obviously have a gap in my understanding
[15:47:51] <Zerxer> Aragon: are you using a debugger to easily see if there's any syntax errors?
[15:48:12] <Zerxer> I didn't click your link, busy
[15:48:25] <Aragon> Zerxer, you mean like jslint? it says my code is valid
[15:48:37] <Zerxer> I mean like firebug or the chrome dev console
[15:48:42] <Zerxer> while the code is executing
[15:51:33] <Aragon> Zerxer, ah i see, i have firebug, but didnt knew it has this functions, i now have my error, it was a error in the php script, it doesnt return valid json :) thanks anyway :)
[15:51:33] <jonkri> haha
[15:51:40] <jonkri> that oil in iraq message was funny :)
[15:52:22] <Zerxer> we're over it, feed not the trolls
[15:52:29] <Zerxer> you'll upset bot-t
[15:52:30] <bot-t> Zerxer, Is that a question?
[15:52:49] <Zerxer> it's not a question, you don't have to put on a brave face

[16:01:29] <ch3mical> jabley: don't know what you're looking for
[16:02:10] <jabley> ch3mical: what you appear to be saying is that you can't have a JSON payload for an ajax call which contains ??
[16:02:29] <dmarkey> With Jquery accordion, would it be hard to make the title editable?
[16:02:34] <jabley> that's news to me, so I was looking for where that's defined and how I can work around it

[16:10:19] <jabley> seems relevant to what I'm asking
[16:10:31] <jabley> but adding jsonp: false doesn't seem to help me
[16:11:03] <interopcop> jabley: thanks - exactly what I needed
[16:11:21] <jabley> interopcop: np
[16:13:04] <jabley> well, it does send the correct data to the server, when I use jsonp:false
[16:15:00] <djQuery> dmarkey: just put a button next to it on hover that has a tooltip called edit. click on the button and add an input to the header that has the same text as the label
[16:18:08] <ch3mical> jabley: even if you add JSONP false, if the method thinks there's a JSONP qualifier in the URL, it will switch to JSONP
[16:21:12] <cgcardona> hello. I'm using jQuery and HTML5 canvas to draw some musical notes on a staff. I'm using .each() to cycle through each div with a class of 'measure.' Then I'm using a nested .each() to cycle through each div with a class of 'note' and drawing it to the screen with canvas. I would like to add 50 to xaxis each time it iterates through the outer .each(). any suggestions?

[16:24:20] <CoolCat_2011> hi all!
[16:25:20] <CoolCat_2011> im having a little issue with fancybox. (i can parent.$.fancybox.close(); from it title, but not from the iframe itself)
[16:25:41] <CoolCat_2011> i think i would need to reach the grandparent, but im not sure how...
[16:25:56] <CoolCat_2011> something like parent.parent.$.fancybox.close(); !?!?!?
[16:27:02] <ch3mical> jabley: I would just wrap the value of the email with escape()
[16:27:46] <ch3mical> Then in php do url_decode($_GET["email"]) on that param
[16:28:16] <ch3mical> urldecode() actually
[16:29:49] <ch3mical> CoolCat_2011: if that object is inside an iframe you won't be able to touch it from the containing page
[16:30:44] <CoolCat_2011> ch3mical if you can look at blog.sisdipe.com.br , you could click on the sidebar ad...
[16:30:59] <CoolCat_2011> it opens a fancybox with an iframe inside it...
[16:31:30] <CoolCat_2011> the page iframed would have a button (in the most bottom) to close this fancybox window...
[16:32:04] <jabley> ch3mical: sadly, I'm still getting the jsonp callback failure
[16:32:14] <CoolCat_2011> not sure if this scenario fits your description!
[16:32:28] <ch3mical> CoolCat_2011: I would try setting the fancybox object to a variable when you open it to make it easier to address again later (i.e. when you want to close it), maybe that will help... so put myFancyBox = fancybox code here; then later you can just do myFancyBox.close();
[16:32:38] <ch3mical> jabley: strange
[16:34:07] <jabley> ch3mical: my bad
[16:36:53] <CoolCat_2011> ch3mical i was tring to do something like that, your example gave me some light on the issue! :)
[16:36:55] <CoolCat_2011> thanks!

[16:51:32] <elb0w_> Anyone know any good image uploaders?
[16:51:36] <elb0w_> that arent too heavy?
[16:51:56] <eddiemonge> thats a bit broad.
[16:52:20] <elb0w_> An ajax image uploader?
[16:52:22] <elb0w_> for a form
[16:52:35] <djQuery> ?ajaxform
[16:52:35] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[16:52:45] <eddiemonge> ?g ajax image uploader
[16:52:46] <bot-t> eddiemonge, PHP AJAX Image Upload, Truly Web 2.0! - http://www.atwebresults.com/php_ajax_image_upload/
[16:52:48] <elb0w_> Well lookin for a little more than that
[16:53:21] <elb0w_> second one works
[16:53:22] <elb0w_> thanks
[16:54:02] <eddiemonge> if that works then you didnt google your question did you?
[16:54:42] <elb0w_> No, first day on IRC
[16:55:02] <eddiemonge> first day on the internet as well? lol j/k
[16:55:22] <elb0w_> man these are all so ugly or overkill
[16:55:31] <elb0w_> Makes me want to just write something simple and clean
[16:55:42] <eddiemonge> there really isnt simple for ajax file upload
[16:56:00] <elb0w_> Yeah but you have to cut out all their crap they put in it
[16:56:18] <elb0w_> everything I find is so convoluted with useless stuff
[16:56:20] <shesek> Have you looked at uploadify ?
[16:56:40] <elb0w_> shesek: nope, thanks looks promising
[16:57:18] <elb0w_> see this is what im talking about
[16:57:31] <shesek> There was also something written as a jQuery plugin that's pretty nice
[16:57:31] <elb0w_> only downside is it uses flash, other than that pretty nice
[16:57:36] <shesek> but I can't remember its name
[16:57:45] <shesek> you have no choice other than using Flash for that
[16:58:12] <elb0w_> Why? Cant you use a iframe?
[16:58:20] <shesek> well, at least if you want to have a progress bar and multiple files support
[16:58:30] <elb0w_> I just want a upload button and a image
[16:58:36] <elb0w_> but this is simple enough
[16:58:38] <elb0w_> thanks
[16:58:44] <shesek> I personally think progress bars helps the user
[16:58:55] <shesek> well, yeah, just set target on the form to an invisible iframe
[16:59:01] <Specialist> hi all, is there a way to retrieve the text of a jQuery element (exclusing its descendants)? .text() seems to be recursive...
[16:59:07] <shesek> and bind for the load() event of the iframe after you submit the form
[16:59:44] <shesek> but using Flash it nicer
[17:00:03] <elb0w_> yeah until they want to view it on a webpage
[17:00:05] <elb0w_> er
[17:00:08] <elb0w_> ipad
[17:00:22] <shesek> I personally use Uploadify and a fallback to dnyamic multiple <input type=file> elements and invisible iframe when Flash is off
[17:00:23] <eddiemonge> Specialist: not easily.
[17:00:42] <shesek> (when I need multiple files support)
[17:01:17] <Specialist> what I am trying to achieve is to apply a regexp to the text on a page
[17:01:33] <eddiemonge> Specialist: for what purpose?
[17:02:22] <shesek> on your own page or a page you're fetching from another website?
[17:03:25] <Specialist> eddiemonge: i'd like to replace some text that matches a certain pettern w/o altering the dom structure
[17:04:03] <shesek> and you don't know what DOM element this text is in?
[17:04:06] <eddiemonge> Specialist: so you want to do a regex on the whole page?
[17:04:28] <Zerxer> how come if you do .live('click') on an ID that doesn't exist yet, when it does exist, the event doesn't trigger on click? but it works fine if you bind to mouseup instead
[17:04:47] <Specialist> eddiemonge: yep, i'd like to alter all text that resembles a phone number (from a Chrome extension)
[17:04:52] <shesek> Zerxer, paste it, preferablly to jsfiddle
[17:04:54] <eddiemonge> Zerxer: because your code is broken?
[17:05:01] <Zerxer> it's not broken
[17:05:03] <Zerxer> but hang on
[17:05:11] <eddiemonge> id say its broken
[17:05:17] <Zerxer> would you
[17:05:30] <eddiemonge> Specialist: ok then. have fun with that. and i dont know how you would
[17:05:41] <eddiemonge> Zerxer: yup since that is what live is for
[17:05:46] <Zerxer> one variable in this is that I'm also initializing jQuery button on the link after it's appended to the document
[17:05:58] <Zerxer> well as I said, it works fine if I substitute click with mouseup
[17:06:12] <shesek> Specialist, oh, cool
[17:06:29] <shesek> I found someone who implemented the way I thought to do that
[17:06:30] <shesek> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/find-and-replace-text-with-javascript/
[17:06:40] <elb0w_> shesek: thank god for you haha, this is clean and simple
[17:06:42] <elb0w_> appreciate it :)
[17:06:49] <elb0w_> already implemented it
[17:07:13] <eddiemonge> i bet you its slow
[17:07:19] <shesek> cool
[17:07:52] <shesek> eddiemonge, I can't really think of another way other than finding the text node that has the text in it
[17:09:26] <Specialist> shesek: thanks. looks a little complex compared to $('*').filter(function() { ...}), but will probably work better...
[17:09:34] <shesek> elb0w_, you welcome
[17:10:30] <shesek> Specialist, do note that in cases where its in multiple text nodes, e.g. <div id="phone"><span class="ext">+904</span>1231234</div> or something, it won't work
[17:11:18] <shesek> for those cases the best you can do is find the deepest DOM element that contains the whole phone number and update the HTML of this element only
[17:11:42] <Specialist> shesek: that's fine for me (it does not need to be 100% reliable)
[17:11:51] <shesek> But it will break events attached to elements in that element and probably some other stuff
[17:12:12] <shesek> $('#phone .ext').click(foo) for example will stop working after that
[17:14:04] <eddiemonge> Zerxer: no code?
[17:14:34] <shesek> well, than, I would start with $(document.body).contents(), look for elements that contains phone numbers, and than check if any of that element's child elements contain this phone number too, and so on in a recusrive way until you find the deepest element with the phone number
[17:14:46] <shesek> (@ Specialist ^)
[17:15:28] <shesek> (until you find an element that contains a phone number, but none of its childs contains that phone number, and than you update that element's innerHTML)
[17:15:42] <Specialist> shesek: one question regarding the event breakage: as long as I only change text, shouldn't events be unaffcected?
[17:15:49] <eddiemonge> wow that sounds highly inefficient
[17:15:56] <shesek> eddiemonge, it is
[17:16:10] <Zerxer> eddiemonge: went to debug it more myself, since it was definitely something with the jQuery button initializing. turns out the other dev that's assigned to this project with me put .button().click( e.stopPropagation() ) for some reason. was definitely a problem with the code but at least I can say it wasn't mine :(
[17:16:32] <Zerxer> wonder why they needed that to be added
[17:16:33] <shesek> Specialist, if you're looking only for text nodes that contains the whole number and ignore the <div id="phone"><span class="ext">+904</span>1231234</div> cases - than yes, it won't break events
[17:16:45] <elb0w_> shesek: you know how to get a handle on the file path of what was just uploaded?
[17:16:48] <elb0w_> I dont see it in their docs
[17:17:00] <eddiemonge> Zerxer: to stop the click from bubbling up. usually only needed if there is a click event assigned in the ancestry for that element
[17:17:02] <Zerxer> maybe to not submit forms
[17:17:04] <jabley> ch3mical: thanks for your help earlier
[17:17:20] <elb0w_> ah my bad
[17:17:20] <jabley> looks like it's a 1.5.2 issue - http://jsfiddle.net/FtX2g/
[17:17:21] <Zerxer> if the button was inside form wrappers, since we're basically using ajax for everything
[17:17:21] <elb0w_> nvm
[17:17:24] <eddiemonge> Zerxer: no, thats preventDefault
[17:18:04] <ch3mical> jabley: did you get it working?
[17:18:17] <Specialist> shesek: ok, perfect. thanks for your help!
[17:18:19] <Zerxer> that's my only assumption, but they probably didn't know which to use. I'll just change it over
[17:18:24] <jabley> not to my satisfaction
[17:18:34] <jabley> guess I need to move off 1.5.2 :D
[17:18:48] <ch3mical> :/
[17:19:22] <shesek> Specialist, hmm, using an XPath might be more efficient than doing it manually
[17:20:11] <Specialist> shesek: XPaths are mostly uncharted territory for me. I guess, those also support regexps?
[17:20:34] <ssswdon_> can someone help me with the debate of jquery vs extjs/sencha, any good comparisons or reviews
[17:21:22] <shesek> Specialist, I just Googled that up, it seems like they do: http://www.regular-expressions.info/xpath.html
[17:21:25] <shesek> but I never used it myself
[17:21:57] <Specialist> shesek: thanks! digging through the search results...
[17:22:26] <ssswdon__> mgmt like the look of ext but I am trying to sell the unobtrusive nature of jquery
[17:23:19] <shesek> Specialist, maybe something like //text()[fn:matches(normalize-space(), 'regex', 'flags'))] would do the trick
[17:23:28] <eddiemonge> ssswdon__: ext is unobtrusive too
[17:26:27] <shesek> I'm not quite sure how to filter text nodes by their contents, I usually do that on regular DOM elements
[17:26:51] <shesek> but it seems like using normalize-space() should return the contents of the text node
[17:27:12] <shesek> I mean, usually you would use something like //div[starts-with(text(), 'foo')]
[17:27:25] <shesek> but I don't think you can do //text[starts-with(text(), 'foo')]
[17:27:35] <shesek> * //text()[starts-with(text(), 'foo')]
[17:29:12] <shesek> yeah, it doesn't work - but normalize-space() does work well
[17:29:40] <Specialist> ok, trying to adapt it to my code...
[17:32:11] <shesek> well, good luck
[17:32:23] <shesek> I'm off, need to wake up in 4.5 hours :-(

[20:27:29] <coldhead> amereservant: this = $(this) ?
[20:27:42] <coldhead> or via apply() // shudder
[20:28:13] <gdoteof_home> coldhead: sick.  thanks
[20:29:44] <amereservant> coldhead, I thought that was it, but it's not working for some odd reason.

[20:31:03] <bot-t> amereservant, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:35:59] <coldhead> amereservant: i prefer the convention $this =  $(this) ;
[20:36:09] <coldhead> so you know that that this is magic, and the original this is still around
[20:37:16] <amereservant> coldhead, Yeah, that looks like what I was actually trying to achieve.  The problem was the context of $(this) changes in my plugin, so I needed to assign $(this) to something before it changed and wanted to use $this.
[20:37:37] <amereservant> It's been a while since I've seen it re-assigned that way, so I couldn't remember how to do it.
[20:52:09] <Lorisse_> hi i have a question about twitter's follow, following and unfollow buttons. did they use jquery for that?
[20:56:50] <coldhead> probably, Lorisse_
[20:56:55] <coldhead> they use it in a lot of places
[20:56:56] <coldhead> why?
[20:57:52] <Lorisse_> cause im trying to make a button with the similar button states.
[20:58:29] <coldhead> that's certainly doable in jQuery
[20:58:44] <coldhead> it's mostly doable in CSS, actually
[20:59:45] <Lorisse_> hmm i'm trying to find tutorials for it but i can't find any.
[21:02:34] <coldhead> Lorisse_: http://www.9lessons.info/2009/04/exactly-twitter-like-follow-and-remove.html

[21:17:24] <Conexion> Let's say I have a Canvas element with a circle drawn on it. Whenever your mouse goes over the circle, it changes color. Two questions: Can I use JQuery to have it fade between the colors, and second, can I get a tooltip in a div to show next to it?
[21:18:07] <Conexion> For the first question, would it just be easier to use straight Javascript?
[21:19:04] <coldhead> i don't think jquery can help you access elements within a canvas
[21:19:16] <elb0w_> oh I stole it from some old code I wrote that was used for stock symbols heh, didnt notice getting late :x
[21:19:17] <coldhead> so pure JS is probably the better bet

[21:19:47] <Conexion> <3
[21:20:17] <Conexion> Mmkey. Is there a way I have a div show up as a tooltip near my mouse position on the canvas element?
[21:20:22] <elb0w_> are there any light weight text areas that would convert text formating to html formating?
[21:21:28] <Conexion> I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. Like, are you talking about converting rich text to html?
[21:22:01] <Conexion> Or just characters like # or < to their html entities?
[21:23:36] <coldhead> Conexion: i think that could be done with a mouseover handler accessing the x and y co-ordinates of the event object
[21:24:02] <Conexion> Mmkey, would I just fade the div in at the absolute position or something?

[21:25:29] <imsky> $.squirrel();
[21:25:49] <Conexion> :D
[21:28:21] <imsky> what's happening in this neck of the woods
[21:28:29] <elb0w_> Conexion: Yeah, like in a text area if someone hits enter in there I want to preserve the formatting so I can send an email
[21:28:59] <elb0w_> Its ok ill look tomorrow, gotta hit the hay
[21:29:01] <elb0w_> night :)
[21:29:11] <Conexion> gah, night :)
[21:29:28] <Conexion> Notttta, just trying to figure out if there is a way to integrate div tooltips into a canvas element
[21:29:41] <Conexion> If not, I'll just make the tooltips right inside of the element
[21:29:54] <cheetahfoot> how can i give an initial position to a draggable div? i want to position it at the bottom right of the window ...
[21:30:33] <imsky> cheetahfoot: lolol .css mayne
[21:30:36] <imsky> ?css @ cheetahfoot
[21:30:37] <bot-t> cheetahfoot, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[21:30:39] <Conexion> Hmm, have you set the css to:: position: absolute; bottom: 0; right;0; ?
[21:31:38] <cheetahfoot> Conexion:  um, yes.
[21:31:55] <Conexion> What did that do?
[21:32:35] <cheetahfoot> the div's position stayed in the normal flow ...
[21:32:41] <imsky> lol
[21:32:46] <imsky> i'll fix it for $50
[21:33:00] <Conexion> try

[21:33:36] <imsky> ask imsky

[21:33:37] <imsky> he knows
[21:33:48] <cheetahfoot> Conexion: thx. and gpk, yes. both fixed now.
[21:33:53] <Jakey> not really imsky :)

[21:34:14] <Conexion> I DID IT, I HELPED SOMEONE!1
[21:34:18] <imsky> Conexion++
[21:34:26] <cheetahfoot> Conexion:  lol.
[21:34:30] <cheetahfoot> Conexion:
[21:34:37] <cheetahfoot> Conexion: yup.
[21:34:48] <Conexion> xD
[21:35:03] <Conexion> My existence has be validated!
[21:35:13] <imsky> your net worth has increased by
[21:35:17] <imsky> $0.00
[21:35:20] <Conexion> Haha
[21:35:40] <imsky> or has it >_>
[21:35:43] <Conexion> Actually I have a job interview tomorrow as an "HTML5 Developer"
[21:35:50] <imsky> that's gonna be fun
[21:35:53] <imsky> are you in the us?
[21:36:00] <Conexion> Yup, it is an 8 hour interview :p
[21:36:02] <Conexion> Yup
[21:36:05] <imsky> really, for html5
[21:36:11] <imsky> for a standard that's not even done yet
[21:36:22] <imsky> 8 hours
[21:36:23] <imsky> hmm
[21:36:36] <Conexion> The company is getting ready to convert all of their Flash products to HTML5 for use in iPads, etc
[21:37:00] <Conexion> (Maybe I'll score a free iPad?)
[21:37:06] <enerel> how to make fadein out transition effect to the background images of this http://www.bellavista.mn
[21:37:13] <Jakey> hell yea Conexion
[21:37:16] <Jakey> you would
[21:37:24] <Conexion> Haha I NEED IT FOR TESTING BRO
[21:38:07] <dr0id> mootools ?
[21:38:23] <dr0id> The Best of Paul Irish in 2011 
[21:38:24] <Conexion> enerel: I'd wait for the DOM to be ready -  $(document).ready(function(), etc... then fade it in over a few seconds
[21:38:25] <dr0id> huh ?
[21:38:36] <imsky> haha free ipad
[21:38:47] <imsky> 8 hours for a free ipad? you'd do it
[21:39:01] <enerel> Conexion: i did so
[21:39:17] <Conexion> Hah, no the interview is 8 hours. If they hire me it will be a 40 hour/week salary job
[21:39:31] <imsky> that's what i'm saying
[21:39:41] <imsky> though 8 hours for a teach interview is excessive
[21:39:44] <imsky> tech*
[21:39:58] <Conexion> enerel: When I refreshed the page it did the fade in, I'd make it a bit slower though
[21:40:24] <Conexion> Yeah, but they want to see what I can do on an average work day
[21:40:32] <Conexion> make sure I can keep up with what they need done
[21:41:05] <Conexion> The benefits are great though, it is 5 minutes from my house, and I could work at home regularly
[21:41:13] <imsky> cool
[21:41:17] <imsky> good luck brodawski
[21:41:26] <enerel> Conexion: but other than first loading image other images doesn not fadein
[21:41:39] <Conexion> Hah thanks, I'm really hoping for this job
[21:42:15] <Conexion> enerel: Oh, so it should be fading to other images? Have you looked at any jquery slideshow tutorials?
[21:43:12] <enerel> currently i am changing the image src into new image
[21:43:26] <enerel> so i dont knwo how to make fadein
[21:43:32] <imsky> it's one thing to want to get into space, it's another to know what you wanna get out of it
[21:44:42] <Conexion> http://css.dzone.com/news/jquery-image-cross-fade-transi
[21:44:49] <Conexion> That should help with image transitions :)
[21:44:53] <Conexion> bbl guys
[21:48:21] <Corren> ok, so I have a page that is http, but I'm doing a jquery post to https
[21:48:30] <Corren> how do I set a cookie value for the https post
[21:49:09] <imsky> i don't know man
[21:49:16] <imsky> why don't you meditate about it
[21:49:19] <imsky> the answer will come
[21:52:03] <Jakey> lol
[21:52:05] <Jakey> fool
[21:52:09] <Jakey> imsky
[21:52:21] <imsky> hello
[21:52:46] <Jakey> no, fool imsky
[21:52:53] <imsky> wut
[21:52:57] <Jakey> is what i meant
[21:53:06] <imsky> you are a wise sage, jakey
[21:53:15] <imsky> i shall tell my peoples of your native tongue
[21:53:54] <Jakey> lol
[21:55:28] <kurol> i shall sing you the song of my people
[21:55:46] <Jakey> hehe
[21:55:53] <Jakey> fool
[21:56:20] <imsky> jakey's high as a kite, i think
[21:56:33] <imsky> high on that truck-stop meth
[21:58:05] <cgcardona> how can I get var ctx from getContext() to get passed into drawStaffLines() ? http://pastebin.com/HAt9aGam
[21:58:27] <imsky> whoa where do you think you are
[21:58:32] <imsky> this is #jquery, good sir
[21:59:04] <imsky> but if you must know, just write var ctx = getContext();
[22:00:00] <cgcardona> imsky: :) awesome. next time I'll keep the straight javascript questions to #javascript. Thanks
[22:00:07] <imsky> ok bud take care
[22:03:06] <justinTNT> cgcardona : you could use jq to select the canvas object you want the context of ...
[22:03:35] <enerel> $("#bgimg").fadeOut('fast');
[22:03:36] <enerel> $("#bgimg").delay(200).attr('src',sbg).fadeIn('slow');
[22:03:36] <enerel> the image flashes why?
[22:05:48] <dr0id> maybe because the fadeout is not complete when fadein is triggered
[22:06:13] <cgcardona> justinTNT: the function i created works good now that i know to use ctx = getContext(); from within the calling function.
[22:06:44] <enerel> dr0id: like this $("#bgimg").fadeOut('fast', function(){ $("#bgimg").delay(200).attr('src',sbg).fadeIn('slow'); });
[22:06:53] <justinTNT> cgcardona: I was focussed on addressing imsky's objection ...
[22:07:06] <cgcardona> oh. gotcha ;)
[22:07:10] <dr0id> that should'nt flash it, enerel
[22:07:39] <enerel> it worked
[22:07:41] <enerel> tnx
[22:22:53] <kostodo> Are there any plugins or tutorials that let you get this kind of effect on images? http://www.psykopaint.com/
[22:23:13] <kostodo> Allowing you to split two images in half, and reveal more of the images as you slide over with your mouse
[22:23:51] <imsky> oh yeah tons
[22:25:01] <kostodo> really?
[22:26:19] <imsky> oh yeah, just gobs and gobs
[22:26:21] <imsky> scads, really

[22:27:16] <biodegabriel> he's trolling
[22:27:43] <imsky> hmm
[22:28:05] <biodegabriel> i know github is working with this kind of effect to. i'm not sure how they do it. https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes
[22:28:10] <imsky> lol
[22:28:28] <kostodo> biodegabriel: having a look at the link
[22:28:30] <imsky> yes, it's magical to have 2 divs with separate z-indexes
[22:28:37] <imsky> and a background image for each
[22:28:51] <Jakey> thats easy KostasDi
[22:28:51] <biodegabriel> imsky: sorry, i meant the image diff is a bit more mysterious to me. :P
[22:28:52] <Jakey> kostodo
[22:29:07] <kostodo> but i need it to reveal with the mouse position
[22:29:09] <Jakey> that effect was use in showing the tsunami disaster
[22:29:17] <imsky> biodegabriel: apologize for calling me a troll
[22:29:18] <imsky> do it
[22:29:18] <Jakey> in japan
[22:29:25] <kostodo> Jakey: yeah thats the one

[22:31:07] <kostodo> heh
[22:31:37] <Jakey> many ways to do it
[22:31:43] <Jakey> but i wont use the z-index way
[22:31:53] <Jakey> but with width
[22:32:11] * imsky laffs

[22:33:21] <imsky> kostodo: let me know if you want it built
[22:33:32] <imsky> jakey's here, getting high on truck-stop meth
[22:33:51] <kostodo> imsky: if you're bored and feel like building it that would be great
[22:34:02] <imsky> kostodo: i'm never bored for a reasonable fee :)
[22:34:31] <kostodo> imsky: gotcha, but thats not possible unfortunately.
[22:34:33] <kostodo> thanks for the offer though
[22:34:40] <imsky> no problem bud
[22:35:11] <kostodo> no way of doing online payments where i come from
[22:36:28] <Jakey> no?
[22:36:31] <Jakey> really

[22:36:44] <imsky> bitcoin :D
[22:36:47] <Jakey> $50 US dollars
[22:36:58] <imsky> lolol "you can't do payments? HIRE ME"
[22:37:12] <imsky> truck-stop meth is enjoying triple-digit growth thanks to jakey
[22:37:28] <srj55> I want to use .change()  and .toggle('slow') for when a user checks/unchecks a checkbox, hide some divs 'slow'ly.  but how do I set the direction of the show or hide for the toggle?
[22:37:46] <imsky> srj55: direction?
[22:38:00] <kostodo> wayyy to much meth going down in here
[22:38:14] <srj55> when I check it, I want it to hide, uncheck=show...
[22:38:55] <imsky> so...toggle based on checked state
[22:39:24] <imsky> srj55: here's a similar problem i solved ages ago http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5724891/why-isnt-this-jquery-toggling-upon-radio-selection/5725542#5725542
[22:39:44] <Jakey> <imsky> truck-stop meth is enjoying triple-digit growth thanks to jakey ^O^
[22:40:43] <srj55> right now I have this:     $('#id_show_passive_candidates').change(function() {
[22:40:43] <srj55>         $('.passiverecord').toggle('slow')
[22:40:43] <srj55>     });
[22:40:52] <imsky> srj55: look at the link
[22:40:58] <imsky> stop pasting your code in here
[22:43:08] <srj55> imsky: problem is that you can't use  .toggle() with showOrHide   AND [duration]
[22:43:36] <imsky> o_O
[22:43:39] <imsky> yes you can
[22:43:46] <imsky> and if you can't
[22:43:52] <imsky> write some javascript lol
[22:43:57] <imsky> jquery is just a library
[22:44:32] <srj55> imsky: I think that goes without saying.
[22:44:46] <srj55> imsky: thanks for the effort though
[22:44:49] <imsky> hmm ok
[22:50:54] <imsky> reeeeed liiiiiiiight
[22:50:57] <imsky> stooooop siiiiiiign
[22:57:09] <Corren> can anyone articulate why http and https (at the same domain) are considered cross domain?
[22:58:35] <imsky> yes
[22:58:37] <imsky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[23:06:30] <enerel> what is firebug saying? Image corrupt or truncated
[23:07:49] <imsky> yer junk's corrupt man
[23:09:31] <Jakey> LOL
[23:25:48] <Corren> it doesn't really say *why* changing scheme is cross domain, just that it is
[23:25:51] <Corren> oh well
[23:26:25] <Jakey> RULES IS RULES
[23:26:51] <imsky> Corren: consider a real-world use case, if a http doc can access a https doc, there's a loss in security
[23:27:52] <Corren> so, say I want to transit a secret back to the client, to be used in hash based security, and obviously I want that secret to be sent over ssl
[23:28:17] <Corren> but then, it should be able to be http from there on based on using the secret to hash calls
[23:28:32] <imsky> that makes no sense
[23:28:43] <imsky> if you want it to be sent over ssl...you use https
[23:29:07] <Corren> right
[23:29:19] <Corren> but I want successive calls to be over http as it's less expensive
[23:29:23] <Corren> using this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC
[23:30:09] <Corren> but I can't figure out how to get the secret from https available in the http pages
[23:30:29] <imsky> well using js for this is already the wrong direction
[23:30:33] <imsky> do it server-side if you must
[23:34:22] <ZeuZ> I have a form, wich is currently sending data through post to a PHP script. The form is also generated by the PHP script (static, though). I'd like to replace that with an AJAX request, but I've gotten lost at how to deal with the data param, how can I do to send "data1="textbox1.text? ok, languaje mismatch, but still you get the point
[23:39:03] <eldho> u need to access the value in textbox and send it to server using $.Ajax
[23:39:36] <ZeuZ> eldho, that's exactly what I need to do, though how can I do it is what's dazzled me
[23:39:44] <srj55> I would like to use jquery form plugin to submit a form via ajax.  However, I don't want to simply dump the response into a 'target' element as this plugin allows.  I want to dump a specific element into target.  Since the plugin doesn't allow this, maybe I could use the success callback to update the target?
[23:40:14] <eldho> $("#textboxid").val() will do that in jquery
[23:40:47] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/dZerb/ any one idea's i could get a set var and a empty one in a good statement?
[23:42:00] <ZeuZ> eldho, so something like data: "data1="+$("#text1").val()+"&data2="+$("#text2") should work?
[23:43:48] <eldho> yup
[23:45:27] <nevvermind1> <label ... aria-pressed="false" for="c1"...></label>. i guess that's probably a custom attribute. i've tried $("[area-pressed]"), but it doesn't work. how can i select an element with that attribute? also, selecting $(".ui-button[for='c1']").attr("for") shows "c1", but $(".ui-button[for='c1']").attr("area-pressed") is undefined
[23:47:52] <ZeuZ> eldho, also, to modify the HTML of a div with the response of the query, what can I do? .html=result inside the success function?
[23:48:52] <eldho> u can write $("#divid").html(resultText);
[23:51:59] <ZeuZ> eldho, Ok I think I got the logic though I beleave I got lost somewhere, this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/fdj9ca8f
[23:52:20] <ZeuZ> eldho, most likely a problem with braces? could you check it out?
[23:55:29] <ZeuZ> eldho, since adding that snippet causes the site to not load et all, something must be wrong.. I beleave I also corrected it though
[23:55:33] <eldho> http://pastebin.com/3R2wNS5G
[23:57:10] <ZeuZ> eldho, well that way something else is messed up then because it won't load the rest of the site
[23:57:45] <ZeuZ> ah sorry forget that
[23:59:26] <ZeuZ> eldho, well it isn't quite working... it doesn't seem to be rewritting the data inside the div...
[23:59:56] <ZeuZ> instead it does as usual and replaces the whole screen with the result
