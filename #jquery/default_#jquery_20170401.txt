[06:51:38] <latemus> i was using .html('heres the html code') to populate a div. when i moved the html code into another file, and used .load('path to the html file'), later jquery calls on elements by id, which come from this (now) external html file, and .load-ed into the parent div, are not accessible by jquery, why?
[06:52:50] <latemus> the html code which i moved into an external file was a form, and the jquery validation brakes now that the form html is populated into a div via .load().
[06:53:08] <latemus> has anyone seen this before?
[06:54:47] <latemus> it seems to me as though the dom tree has not been updated to include the id's of the ements loaded by .load, from the perspective of the jquery file doing the .load()-ing.

[08:45:16] <drej> open up your inspector and in the console you should see any errors that javascript is throwing
[09:47:18] <blackadder_> the arrow function expression does not work with jquery?
[09:50:04] <shoky> blackadder_: not if you want to use jquery's `this` inside a jquery callback
[09:50:32] <shoky> because arrow functions always inherit the outer scope's `this`, ignoring whatever jquery sets it to
[09:51:13] <shoky> other than that issue, they work fine with jquery afaik
[09:51:26] <blackadder_> thanks
[09:53:50] <blackadder_> Okay I got it to work with what you said
[09:53:58] <blackadder_> Now going to figure out when to use what
[10:05:25] <blackadder_> I should probably just look it up in a search engine, but I'll go ahead anyway
[10:05:40] <blackadder_> When should you use plain javascript and when should you use jquery?
[10:12:15] <lemarc> I have alot of <td>text</td> elements in my code, how do I remove all the text inside td element. They donot have any class or id or name
[10:21:59] <blackadder_> lemarc: let tds = document.querySelectorAll("td");
[10:21:59] <blackadder_> for (let i = 0; i < tds.length; i++) {
[10:21:59] <blackadder_>   tds[i].textContent = "";
[10:21:59] <blackadder_> }
[10:23:13] <blackadder_> change let to const
[10:23:26] <blackadder_> (outside the for)
[10:23:40] <blackadder_> so const tds
[10:24:45] <lemarc> blackadder_: that worked, thanks

[14:38:07] <zrupitaq> Hello, I am using jquery ui autocomplete and would need to use it in a way, where only say the first 3 words of a whole sentence get shown for autocompletion and then if those match in the input form/ie the user types them in, then the sentences that start with these 3 words would get shown
[14:40:37] <zrupitaq> something like shown on http://demo.simpleql.com ? Would such a thing be possible with jquery autocomplete?
[15:44:46] <ekkis> morning everyone.  I'm using jQuery 3.2.1 and am doing something like this: `var p = Promise.resolve(); for (...) { p = p.then($.ajax(...)); }; return p;` and later: `p.then(...)` but I find that the final .then() executes before any of the ajax calls occur... why would this be?
[15:45:11] <ekkis> I'd expect the code to wait for the first ajax before moving on to the second one
[15:45:50] <MagnusVortex> I would not expect that.
[15:47:07] <MagnusVortex> I don't know exactly how that works, but my initial interpretation for p.then would not guarantee FIFO
[15:49:07] <ekkis> but from what I understand the callbacks are executed in the order they are declared
[16:04:34] <ekkis> here's my writeup on the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43161429/how-do-i-chain-ajax-calls-properly
[16:04:45] <ekkis> for anyone that knows about promises and cares to look
