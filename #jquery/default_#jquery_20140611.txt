[00:09:57] <Cork> serge: this is about the best you can do http://jsfiddle.net/a3V2s/
[00:10:34] <Cork> serge: but you should ask the backend to fix there output (or proxy it over a server that can make this sane)
[00:11:02] <Cork> cause this is in noway a stable parse of the response
[00:12:19] <serge> Cork, thanks. I'll try to output URL to js variable.
[00:40:51] <krambiorix> hi, i have a datatables table with 11K rows... The rendering takes 30 seconds... How can i make this faster?
[00:40:57] <krambiorix> any clues/ideas?
[00:41:20] <Woet> krambiorix: you shouldn't really draw 11k rows on the screen at the same time
[00:41:26] <Woet> use AJAX and server side sorting
[00:41:31] <Woet> datatables has support for it.
[01:46:09] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm using a 3rd party module but i want to do a click on some elements it creates
[01:47:03] <EdwardIII> i've poppped a delegate listener $(body).on('click', '.element-i-am-interested-in') but it doesn't seem to trigger. is there some way using the chrome debugger i can see if something is stopping propagation on those elements?
[01:49:18] <Cork> EdwardIII: the module might use event.stopPropagation or return false;
[01:49:25] <Cork> if it dose then you can't get to the event
[01:49:41] <EdwardIII> guess grep is the way to go then
[01:51:07] <EdwardIII> Cork: here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/42yu9/
[01:52:53] <EdwardIII> Cork: i don't see anything in the datepicker that stops prop. though: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js
[01:53:10] <Cork> EdwardIII: what element is it your trying to target?
[01:53:23] <Cork> ah day...
[01:53:25] <Cork> sorry
[01:53:27] <EdwardIII> that's the fella
[01:53:57] <Cork> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/42yu9/1/
[01:54:24] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrm ok, well awesome that it works, but i'm confused as to why heh
[01:54:38] <Cork> EdwardIII: i find it a bit strange too yes
[01:54:47] <Cork> body is a parent so it should bubble there too
[01:54:52] <EdwardIII> yeah
[01:55:00] <EdwardIII> i'm a bit nervous about using that heh
[01:55:07] <Cork> though there is rarely a need to bind things on body
[01:55:19] <Cork> you can just as well bind it on document where your that high up
[01:55:26] <EdwardIII> yeah i was just working my way up the dom
[01:56:00] <buzzybron> hi i am utilizing the jquery ui calendar and currently i need to localize the calendar
[01:57:08] <buzzybron> i need to change the years to buddhist calendar years, is there any way i can extend the calendar widget to display current year + 543 years?
[02:08:31] <Cork> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/42yu9/2/
[02:08:37] <Cork> took a while to figure it out
[02:08:48] <Cork> the plugin uses mousedown and touchstart not click
[02:09:06] <Cork> and apparently that breaks click, not sure why
[02:09:28] <EdwardIII> Cork: heh that's weird
[02:46:28] <Zost> hi guys, I have a question: Is there some easy way to create a little notification for a user after he has been on my site for 2 minutes?
[02:46:38] <Zost> Some easy plugin would be nice
[02:47:56] <sweet2k4> is there a function that handels both click and hover in the same statement, something like: on('click' , 'hover' function() ?
[02:50:21] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: 'click hover'
[02:51:08] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: like on('click hover' function() ?
[02:51:19] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: yep
[02:51:46] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: okey, thanks a lot! il try it out
[02:52:54] <Cork> Zost: simplest should be to simply have a hidden element and do setTimeout(function() { $('#message').show(); }, 7200)
[02:52:58] <Cork> on page load
[02:55:20] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: are you sure? didnt seam to work:   $('#InfoBoxLeft p').on('click hover', function() {
[02:55:26] <Zost> Cork: I would like to display it after 2 minutes even if a user navigates to a different page, so I'm not exactly looking for the simplest option
[02:55:52] <Cork> Zost: uh you can't do that
[02:56:03] <Cork> well except providing an extension they install in there browser
[02:56:18] <Zost> Well I could do it with cookies
[02:56:27] <Zost> and remember when they came
[02:56:40] <Cork> Zost: no cause if they navigate away from your site after one minute
[02:56:52] <Cork> no code you provide can show a message 1 minute later
[02:57:44] <Narhir> hi guys.. is there something cool.. to deal with "preloading slideshows" ?
[02:58:59] <Zost> Cork: yes, of course, but if the user is browsing the page for more than 2 minutes that would display the notifiaction
[02:59:00] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: can you pastebin an example?
[02:59:16] <Cork> Zost: ah you meant it like that
[02:59:19] <Narhir> when I clear cache on my website and I use Big slideshow images it first show the "sldieshow" in broken version while it loads the images..
[02:59:34] <Cork> Zost: well ya that or a localstorage entry
[02:59:34] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: click & hover seems kinda na odd combo, if whatever you want to activate for a click would already have been activated by the hover, no?
[02:59:34] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: sure, give me a second
[02:59:55] <Cork> Zost: though it sounds like what your implementing will be extreamly annoying for the user
[03:00:14] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: i was thinking for ipads
[03:00:53] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: that ppl dont hover on ipads and phones but they do click, but maybe that will equal to a hover
[03:01:27] <Zost> Cork: It's not meant to be annoying, we just need some feedback from users that have been on the page for some time, and we'll be annoying them only for a week
[03:02:29] <Zost> But since I don't have time to mess around with cookies etc, I was thinking if there is some easy plugin where I would just set the delay and it would work
[03:03:06] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: http://jsbin.com/yohegoxa/3/edit
[03:05:42] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: hrm well that code does look valid, and it is a valid way to capture multiple events: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2534089/jquery-multiple-events-to-trigger-the-same-function
[03:07:17] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: yes. strange...
[03:08:19] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: actually, perhaps you should try mouseover
[03:08:51] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: maybe its the 'hover' that is wrong since it dosent work isolated either (without click)
[03:09:03] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: yeah il try that
[03:10:03] <sweet2k4> EdwardIII: that did the trick! thanks for your help!
[03:17:38] <EdwardIII> sweet2k4: no problem!

[03:41:19] <troop> i dont want to copy and paste for all page

[04:22:37] <Cork> simion314: $.parseHTML(string)
[04:22:58] <Cork> and to wrap it in jquery $($.parseHTML(string))
[04:23:11] <simion314> Cork: thx
[04:23:51] <pangelovski> hi guys
[04:31:15] <simion314> Cork:  $.parseHTML is undefined, $ is defined, I am wondering if this is a new function and maybe the jQuery pon the site I am working has an older version? or I need t some extra plugin?
[04:31:31] <Cork> simion314: yes it was added in 1.9
[04:31:36] <Cork> before you just used $()

[04:43:45] <J___> So how would I resolve this ?
[04:43:55] <Cork> either split the cookie string manyally
[04:43:58] <Cork> *manually
[04:44:06] <Cork> or include the $.cookie plugin
[04:44:36] <J___> Alright thanks fellas
[04:47:19] <Lifebridge123> Hello I was told this room could help me figure out how to make a better navigation bar for my site, can anyone help me
[04:49:58] <AL13N_work> how can i match all the next tr's that have first td text='' ?
[04:50:00] <martinklepsch> what might I be doing wrong when an event ("ajax:success") seems to be triggered twice?
[04:50:19] <Cork> AL13N_work: css can't do that
[04:50:47] <AL13N_work> .next("tr:has(td:first='')") ?
[04:50:49] <Woet> Cork: that's why he's not asking in #css, is he?
[04:51:05] <AL13N_work> that's what i have now, but it doesn't work
[04:51:20] <Cork> AL13N_work: so $(this).nextAll().filter(function(elm) { return this.children().first().text() == ''; })
[04:51:35] <AL13N_work> so, no selectors?
[04:51:38] <Cork> no
[04:51:48] <Cork> as css can't select elements based on child elements
[04:52:16] <Cork> AL13N_work: you best option is to set a class on the tr when the td is created
[04:52:17] <AL13N_work> tr > td ?
[04:52:28] <Cork> AL13N_work: will select the td not the tr
[04:52:39] <AL13N_work> :has() ?
[04:52:47] <Woet> AL13N_work: give me a pastie of your HTML please
[04:53:03] <Cork> AL13N_work: that isn't really a selector
[04:53:08] <Cork> it will run js loops
[04:53:18] <AL13N_work> ok, so it's slow, but works
[04:53:37] <AL13N_work> Cork: the way i see it is that there is nothing i can use to check the text of an element
[04:53:44] <Cork> AL13N_work: so $(this).nextAll('tr:has(td:first:empty') might work
[04:53:51] <AL13N_work> hmm
[04:53:53] <Cork> but i SERIOUSLY recommend NOT doing that
[04:54:09] <AL13N_work> Cork: so, when i insert it, i should just add a class
[04:54:13] <Cork> yes
[04:54:24] <Cork> AL13N_work: css doesn't support selecting parent element for a reason
[04:54:36] <Cork> (it is inherently slow)
[04:55:12] <Woet> Cork: why do you keep talking about CSS?
[04:55:22] <Woet> pretty sure the jQuery selector adds on to it
[04:55:29] <AL13N_work> Cork: in that case, how can i match the tr.class but stop at the border
[04:55:36] <Cork> Woet: it does but you want to avoid the js extensions
[04:55:37] <AL13N_work> lemme rephrase it
[04:55:43] <Cork> Woet: as those are again slow
[04:56:13] <AL13N_work> i got $(this) tr.class tr.class tr.class tr tr.class tr.class tr ....
[04:56:22] <AL13N_work> Cork:  i need to get the first 3 here
[04:56:29] <AL13N_work> because the next tr doesn't have this class
[04:57:25] <AL13N_work> Cork: well, i hope you know what i mean
[04:57:37] <Woet> AL13N_work: can you please just make a pastie and tell us what you're trying to achieve
[04:57:50] <Cork> AL13N_work: haven't ever tried to do that but you could try .nextUntill('tr:not(.class)', '.class')
[04:58:11] <Cork> AL13N_work: and ya the actual html would help
[04:58:27] <AL13N_work> nextUntil... heh, didn't know that, thanks, i'll look up the jquery doc on that
[04:58:44] <AL13N_work> Cork: Woet: yeah, sorry, but you understood what i meant, i can probably take it from here, thanks :-)
[04:59:03] <AL13N_work> no offense meant, but it just takes alot of time to make a reproducer ...
[04:59:21] <Cork> AL13N_work: actually no it doesn't
[04:59:38] <Cork> AL13N_work: an example for this question would have taken less time then explaining it
[04:59:43] <Cork> and it wouldn't have taken our time :)
[05:00:36] <martinklepsch> I basically have a form that I have an .on("ajax:success") listener on which logs something. every time I submit the form successfully the log output is duplicate — the events triggering the listener are exactly the same (timestamp, etc)
[05:01:20] <Cork> martinklepsch: sounds like you bind the listener more then once
[05:05:34] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> hip_, i have a thumbsup button, when clicked it changes color and does an ajax call to a server side script to store the vote in db... problem is when you clikc really fast, before the vote is stored in the db, it will handle the click multiple times
[05:05:40] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> is there any way around this?
[05:06:09] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: disable the button on click
[05:06:16] <Cork> and enable it again on .always()
[05:06:31] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> you mean the disabled attribute?
[05:06:36] <Cork> yes
[05:06:42] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> and where to put always() ?
[05:06:47] <Cork> on the ajax call
[05:07:33] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> but actually it's not a button, it's an image
[05:07:47] <martinklepsch> Cork, yeah, that'd make sense. any clever advice how I can see the listeners attached to that element+type?
[05:07:55] <Cork> use somethign like .data('disabled', true/false) then
[05:08:27] <Cork> and have a if($(this).data('disabled')) { return; } before the ajax call
[05:08:32] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Cork: how about the one() method?.
[05:08:50] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: works if you ever only want to allow one click
[05:09:13] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> no it has to be possible to undo the click aswell
[05:09:17] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: don't forget to bind a .fail handler to bind a new event handler on error though
[05:09:25] <martinklepsch> Cork, what you're saying is basically that code is duplicate right? if so I'd have to see different line numbers referring to the two duplicate console.log statements. but these line numbers are the same.
[05:09:34] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok i'll give it a try
[05:10:09] <Cork> martinklepsch: no the line number is most likely the same
[05:10:20] <Cork> but the function that this happens in runs more then once
[05:10:26] <Cork> so you get multiple handlers
[05:13:02] <martinklepsch> Cork. Hmm. I put an ".off('ajax:success')" in front of the .on() statement now — that should theoretically reset all listeners right? it still shows up twice
[05:14:55] <martinklepsch> GOT IT
[05:15:25] <ashgotti> Hello all. I have a jquery mobile app with 5 pages, a front page (has all my custom JS) and 4 sub-pages. The problem I have is that when I navigate to the 4 subpages and back to the front page, my JS is not run again. How do I get around this? I also have prefetching on for the links to the subpages from the front page but turning that off didn't make a difference
[05:15:42] <martinklepsch> Cork, my selector returned to nested results. should have used an id
[05:15:48] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Cork, in this solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209029/best-way-to-remove-an-event-handler-in-jquery - do you know what the namespace represents? I don't understand what that solution does
[05:16:00] <ashgotti> FYI, @nargas is spamming me in PM
[05:16:09] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: you can namespace event bindings
[05:16:27] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> I can use any name I want then?
[05:16:27] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: so you can remove just those events with a specific namespace later
[05:16:29] <martinklepsch> ashgotti, same here, maybe someone can bring that up to freenode stuff?
[05:16:37] <martinklepsch> s/stuff/staff
[05:16:39] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: sure, for the namespace
[05:17:19] <ashgotti> martinklepsch, going to let the staff know
[05:17:26] <troop> i have an accordeon menu, when i load menu to file, via load() function, accerdeon effect doesnt work. any idea?
[05:18:38] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> that thing doesn't work
[05:19:07] <troop> .
[05:19:15] <jemendja> hello
[05:19:16] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> I have this: http://pastebin.com/ZNEwZHCx
[05:22:12] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Why can't I just do clickedItem.off("click"); after the click and then in the success function of the ajax call do clickedItem.on("click") ?
[05:22:20] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> it would make sense but it doesn't work
[05:22:54] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: you don't only want to do it in the success callback
[05:23:04] <Cork> cause then you would have a broken button on errors
[05:23:30] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Yes I also add it in the fail() function of course
[05:23:36] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> but the click handler is gone in both cases
[05:23:41] <Cork> and it is usually a good idea to not dynamically and and remove event handlers for logic
[05:24:11] <Cork> the code becomes cleaner if you just set a value instead
[05:24:33] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> What do you mean?
[05:24:52] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: what i told you before
[05:25:01] <Cork> before you started looking at .one
[05:25:05] <Cork> *once
[05:25:18] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[05:31:15] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> I don't get it Cork, do you have an example?
[05:32:11] <Cork> function() { if($(this).data('disabled')) { return; } $(this).data('disabled', true); ... .always(function() { $(this).data('disabled', false); });  }
[05:33:07] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> "function" represents the click handler function,
[05:33:09] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ?
[05:33:11] <Cork> ya
[05:33:40] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> so on the image I should first add the attribute data-disabled="true"
[05:33:41] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ?
[05:33:46] <Cork> no
[05:33:59] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> no default?
[05:34:14] <Cork> what?
[05:34:33] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> it's the html 5 data attribute on the image
[05:34:33] <Cork> the default is undefined
[05:34:42] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[05:36:12] <AL13N_work> btw: how can i make something blink? (ie: animation with some form of control?)
[05:36:35] <Cork> AL13N_work: ugg...
[05:36:46] <Cork> well you can use @key-frames
[05:36:59] <Cork> and the animate line
[05:37:02] <troop> http://pastebin.com/rrjbFnRp i am loading admin-menu.html to page but if i do this, accordeon menu doesnt work, how can i fix it?
[05:39:32] <AL13N_work> Cork: heh, it's very limited and it's only for a few seconds, when something has changed, and on an internal website
[05:39:54] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Cork: the always function belongs to the ajax call right?
[05:40:19] <AL13N_work> Cork: it's sort of for monitoring, we're gonna put up a TV and put stuff in there; and if something critical fails, i'm gonna blink it and possibly even play some kind of sound
[05:40:40] <AL13N_work> so that people in the office can look up and see the blinking part and notice what's different immediately
[05:40:52] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: try and see
[05:40:54] * AL13N_work goes to read up on keyframes
[05:41:16] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> it's not getting enabled again :(
[05:41:35] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: make a fiddle of the code
[05:41:42] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[05:45:01] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8Qbup/
[05:47:19] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> looks like it doesn't even get inside the .always function
[05:48:39] <jrhe> Is tearing down an element a plugin works on when calling its setup function for a second time common practice? I am playing with the anti scroll plugin and it does this and it just seems stupid. It means I can’t call further anti scroll methods without keeping a reference to the returned instance around.

[05:53:42] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: well you don't take any so...
[05:53:50] <Cork> but that isn't "invalid" for js
[05:55:06] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[05:59:13] <troop> i think load function doesnt load my menu properly...
[06:01:03] <bberry> l
[06:04:12] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> is it possible to make an image with no size?
[06:05:09] <Cork> ecky-ptang-zoobo: that question doesn't make any sense
[06:05:29] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> i need something to put in "src" for an image that disappears
[06:05:49] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> the image tag itself shouldn't be removed, because it can be enabled again by setting a src
[06:05:53] <Cork> why not just set the img tag to visibility: hidden; ?
[06:06:04] <Cork> or display: none if you want it to collaps
[06:06:10] <Cork> (.hide())
[06:06:45] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> yes I can do that
[06:06:56] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> but then I need to swap the visibility each time
[06:07:08] <Cork> sure
[06:07:26] <Cork> i usually use classes for things like this
[06:07:39] <Cork> (and background-image)
[06:10:59] <xec> ecky-ptang-zoobo: you could go for the oldskool 1x1 transparent gif ;)
[06:11:20] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> yeah I had that first, but then it would still be clickable
[06:12:00] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> just show() and hide() works fine
[06:23:07] <rhinoboss> Need some jquery .not iterator help. Please see the question in http://jsfiddle.net/c4yqH/
[06:23:40] <Cork> rhinoboss: ask the question in the channel so ppl can see if they have the answer without having to open a page
[06:24:16] <Jattenalle> $('input[value=""]')
[06:24:19] <Jattenalle> is the answer
[06:24:31] <Jattenalle> or more exactly: .not('input....
[06:24:46] <Jattenalle> Cork, "select non-empty inputs only"
[06:25:12] <rhinoboss> ahh ok thanks, ill try that
[06:25:20] <Cork> rhinoboss: http://jsfiddle.net/c4yqH/2/
[06:25:29] <Jattenalle> hm, that might not check if it has value added by the user actually
[06:25:31] <Cork> Jattenalle: no that won't work
[06:25:33] <Jattenalle> you might jsut have to iterate over
[06:25:34] <Jattenalle> ^^
[06:25:46] <Jattenalle> ya, i realized :)
[06:26:26] <rhinoboss> :Cork thanks
[06:26:32] <rhinoboss> @Cork thanks
[06:26:40] <rhinoboss> lol, how do you tag a username
[06:27:01] <Jattenalle> this is IRC, there's no such fancystuff ;)
[06:27:16] <Cork> rhinoboss: just have the nick in the line
[06:27:23] <Cork> no need for : or @ infront
[06:27:28] <rhinoboss> Ahh ok
[06:27:56] <Cork> Jattenalle: and that isn't fancy just annoying :)
[06:42:31] <antlong_> is there a suggested plugin for nice looking chained dialogues? (or modals)
[07:03:50] <dw> does jQuery have some equivalent to Base.js?  I just want to define new 'class-like objects' without wrangling the prototype manually
[07:05:17] <Cork> dw: $.fn.extend
[07:05:51] <dw> hrmf, not making my app an extension of the jquery object :)
[07:06:39] <Cork> dw: then no jquery doesn't have any prototype helpers in it
[07:06:53] <Cork> it is a dom manipulation framework nothing else
[07:07:37] <xec> $.extend() can merge two objects
[07:08:08] <dw> cool, thanks
[07:24:34] <hxm> hello, I have this testing page http://app.librepensamiento.es/ that looks ok except when I open it trought a iphone
[07:24:40] <hxm> it looks like a zoom out and is too small
[07:27:21] <Radditz> hello
[07:27:31] <thebope> You probably want something along the lines of this hxm   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5">
[07:27:34] <Radditz> it seems when I do append( escapedHTML, it is unescaped)
[07:27:37] <thebope> I think generally its set around 1.0
[07:27:44] <Radditz> mainly if I use it inside an attribute, it gets unescaped into actual html, what must I do?
[07:27:49] <hxm> ah
[07:27:59] <thebope> You put it near the top of your header file
[07:28:08] <thebope> Is it easy to test it out and see if it works?
[07:28:25] <thebope> Fool around with the values and maybe something will look good
[07:28:38] <thebope> Not the best answer ever but I think its the right path
[08:16:21] <interop_madness> is there some short way to register selector.off("eventname").on("eventname", someFunction);  ?
[08:25:49] <s2013> http://codepen.io/ss2k/pen/vkFiu?editors=001 anyone knows why my settimeout isnt working? its only logging one item not all fo them
[08:27:38] <shoky> s2013: you're only calling setDelay once
[08:28:10] <s2013> yeah but i call display() again which should recall it right?
[08:28:42] <shoky> hm? where do you call that
[08:31:57] <s2013> at the end
[08:32:02] <s2013> after i++ shoky
[08:32:32] <shoky> s2013: you're not calling any display..
[08:32:43] <s2013> then what am i calling?
[08:32:54] <shoky> nothing
[08:33:00] <s2013> ...
[08:33:01] <shoky> maybe you're looking at different code than me..
[08:33:08] <shoky> i'm looking at your link
[08:33:15] <s2013> hmm i am
[08:33:16] <s2013> weird
[08:33:36] <s2013> http://codepen.io/ss2k/pen/vkFiu?editors=001
[08:33:43] <s2013> is that what you are loking at
[08:33:47] <shoky> yes
[08:33:58] <s2013> oh
[08:34:01] <s2013> i dont think tiw as saved
[08:34:02] <s2013> oen sec
[08:34:28] <s2013> k i see. the code i was loking at from yesterday. i called display function instead of anonymous function
[08:34:32] <s2013> anyways so how would if ix this
[08:34:53] <shoky> huh?
[08:34:59] <s2013> how would i fix the code i have
[08:35:04] <s2013> so i call it multiple times
[08:35:09] <shoky> what code is that
[08:35:12] <s2013> the one i posted
[08:35:19] <shoky> i have no idea what you're asking
[08:35:27] <s2013> ...
[08:35:29] <shoky> re-post your question from the start
[08:35:41] <s2013> how do i make it log all the image url
[08:35:53] <shoky> log all of them.
[08:35:55] <s2013> i need each images to be delayed by a second
[08:36:00] <shoky> you're only calling console.log once
[08:36:04] <shoky> so it's only logging once.
[08:36:16] <s2013> ok so how do i fix that
[08:36:30] <shoky> call it some more times...
[08:36:33] <s2013> ... jesus man
[08:36:43] <EminenceHC> I have this block of jQuery code: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/950b2b8e0e3de081ce81 I would ONLY like it to be run if input[name='result_set[training_start]'] is loaded in the DOM. How can I check if it appears in the DOM?
[08:37:29] <s2013> http://codepen.io/ss2k/pen/vkFiu?editors=001 i dunno if this is the right way to do it
[08:37:42] <s2013> actually its not
[08:39:29] <duch_kazatel> searching for new headphones for work is a pain.
[08:40:27] <systemfault> Just get those bose noise-canceling headphones :/
[08:40:37] <duch_kazatel> i don't like those.
[08:40:44] <duch_kazatel> uncomfortable.  and i'm kind of picky.
[08:41:52] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: I use these when I’m not at work… http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/shop/dt-770-pro.html Love them, they leak a bit of sound though (at high level)
[08:41:57] <systemfault> s/level/volume
[08:42:25] <duch_kazatel> ooh.  i'll poke at these.
[08:42:57] <bberry> my work asked me to find a headset for everyone to use at the office since we do conference calls a lot.  They wanted something inexpensive.  I chose some logitech circumaural headset that is clearly for gamers. now the office looks like a gaming house.
[08:43:08] <bberry> #missionaccomplished
[08:43:13] <thebope> yea I can't do the over ear
[08:43:14] <duch_kazatel> niiiice
[08:43:24] <thebope> I just use the new iPhone headphones
[08:43:45] <thebope> The buds don't squash my head or get sweaty, I can still *sort of* hear my name if its called
[08:43:48] <bberry> yeah those are okay. SOOO much better than their old ones
[08:43:49] <thebope> and the sounds not bad actually
[08:43:59] <thebope> Yea, about a million times
[08:44:03] <bberry> they dont fall out of my ears all the time
[08:44:04] <thebope> they don't fall out ever it seems like
[08:44:06] <thebope> hahaha
[08:44:10] <bberry> nice
[08:44:40] <EminenceHC> How can I check if an element exists?
[08:44:46] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC check the length.
[08:44:49] <thebope> yea
[08:44:58] <duch_kazatel> $('selector').length
[08:45:02] <thebope> $("yourElement".length > 0)
[08:45:12] <thebope> oh duch_kazatel is correct
[08:45:14] <thebope> mines a bit off
[08:45:20] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ok that just seems weird to me but I guess its the standard way of doing it.. thanks
[08:45:35] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC though normally you don't have to check.
[08:45:40] <duch_kazatel> what are you doing?
[08:46:03] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: For instance I just want to run my javascript if a boolean appears in the DOM.
[08:46:29] <duch_kazatel> that sentence hurts my brain.
[08:46:32] <bberry> what do you mean by "if a boolean appears in the DOM".
[08:46:38] <EminenceHC> haha sorry..
[08:47:24] <systemfault> booleans are not pokemons, they just don’t “appear” :/
[08:47:35] <bberry> lol
[08:47:45] <duch_kazatel> POKIEMANS
[08:47:50] <EminenceHC> the boolean is there if it is served by the backend
[08:47:51] <bberry> systemfault how do you do those tiny "s?
[08:48:03] <EminenceHC> if it is not served by the backend and hence not there in the dom I don't want to run my JS
[08:48:09] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC define "boolean".
[08:48:20] <bberry> EminenceHC what would it look like in html?
[08:48:37] <duch_kazatel> becuase that's a javascript data type, not an HTML thing.
[08:48:42] <EminenceHC> In my case its a boolean but its an input field.
[08:48:43] <systemfault> bberry: I use an annoying IRC client called “Colloquy” on OSX, and by default, it replaces quotes with some fancy ones… and double hyphens with —
[08:48:55] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC then it's a string you're looking for.
[08:48:56] <jessica583> so += is appending two integers as if they're strings... how do i make it add them?
[08:49:01] <bberry> lol, and ... with tiny ellipsis
[08:49:13] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 convert them to numbers first.
[08:49:17] <Jattenalle> jessica583, parseInt()
[08:49:26] <EminenceHC> Well its not a string its a boolean. Boolean is a html thing isn't it?
[08:49:30] <Jattenalle> var result = parseInt(x) + parseInt(y);
[08:49:34] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC nope.
[08:50:00] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC if you're grabbing the value from somewhere in your HTML, it's a string.
[08:50:00] <jessica583> i thought i was doing that...i'll try it in the actual operation instead of on the declaration of the variable that's being added
[08:50:21] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: This is what it looks like in the html: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/f9f27cd9406cc1ecf979
[08:50:31] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC yeah - that's a string to your javascript.
[08:50:37] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah ok
[08:50:41] <bberry> ah. the class is named 'boolean'.
[08:50:56] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC so you want to check a value and run something if it's "1"
[08:50:56] <EminenceHC> Well I am working in rails and that input type is called boolean. Thats why I call it that.
[08:51:04] <EminenceHC> It is stored as a boolean in the database.
[08:51:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah, once you get to HTML/JS land, that's a string.
[08:51:15] <EminenceHC> I see
[08:51:18] <EminenceHC> gotcha
[08:51:22] <duch_kazatel> and js booleans are true/false, not 1/0
[08:51:53] <EminenceHC> I am not sure why the value is 0/1 in html, in my rails app it stores that field as true/false
[08:52:06] <duch_kazatel> because 0/1 are easy to handle.
[08:52:45] <duch_kazatel> so you need to see what the value of this input is and, if it's "1", do something else, right?
[08:52:59] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: So I should be able to wrap my entire JS code in an if statement that checks the length right?
[08:53:26] <duch_kazatel> checking the length might not be appropriate in this case - what is your selector in this case?
[08:53:54] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: No I don't want to check based on the value, the JS I run uses the value of that field to run its logic. I don't want to to run the logic if that input field is not in the DOM.
[08:54:20] <EminenceHC> $("[name='result_set[training_start]']")
[08:54:31] <EminenceHC> ^^ if that isn't in the DOM i don't want to run my JS
[08:54:47] <duch_kazatel> okay, then test the length.  it would be smarter to always add it to the markup and set the value to what you need instead.
[08:55:04] <duch_kazatel> and give it an ID so you can select on that instead.
[08:55:28] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: cool
[08:55:40] <zilberstein> good evening #jquery
[08:55:47] <duch_kazatel> good morning zilberstein
[08:55:55] <CiE|Work> sup guys anyone playing with fabric.js?
[08:56:08] <zilberstein> does someone know why browser parses Long value incorrectly ?
[08:56:12] <zilberstein> it adds 1 to the value
[08:56:21] <duch_kazatel> zilberstein because javascript only has one number type ;)
[08:56:31] <duch_kazatel> what's the value you're working with?
[08:57:05] <zilberstein> 76561198029605280
[08:57:11] <zilberstein> it should be 76561198029605279
[08:57:23] <zilberstein> I can see 76561198029605280 in chrome debug panel
[08:57:28] <zilberstein> but server returns 76561198029605279
[08:57:43] * zilberstein stuck
[08:57:47] <duch_kazatel> that's larger than the largest number JS can handle.
[08:57:49] <frank_o> I have this app that fetches sexy lingerie from the ShopSense API. Live demo: http://runnable.com/U5h5KTHjrhdOsIx7/output -- source: https://gist.github.com/frankie-loves-jesus/11058955
[08:58:01] <frank_o> This fetching, however, makes my app several seconds slower. Is it possible to move this loading to the background instead?
[08:58:23] <EminenceHC> if($('#result_set_training_start').length())  {
[08:58:27] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Does this look right? ^^
[08:58:30] <duch_kazatel> zilberstein JS can handle 64 bit doubles - 9007199254740992 is the largest it can be.
[08:58:40] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC if($('#result_set_training_start').length)  {
[08:58:45] <duch_kazatel> length is just a property, not a method.
[08:58:45] <frank_o> Maybe something as simple as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504445/spawn-a-background-process-in-ruby?
[08:58:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah I see, thanks again sir.
[08:59:22] <duch_kazatel> frank_o wrong room
[09:00:55] <jsn00blah> Hi I was wondering if someone could point out my noobish mistake here, im trying to remove all the div's (and siblings) that match the data attr searchterm.  http://jsbin.com/baduyefo/2/edit
[09:00:57] <zilberstein> duch_kazatel: I see. Thank you !
[09:01:02] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: In what way?
[09:01:12] <duch_kazatel> frank_o you're asking ruby questions.  this is a jquery room...
[09:01:13] <frank_o> This is all very new to me
[09:01:21] <frank_o> oh fuck
[09:01:33] <frank_o> My bad my bad I thought I was in #rubyonrails :O
[09:01:41] * frank_o shakes his head
[09:01:59] <duch_kazatel> jsn00blah you want .data('searchterm')
[09:02:58] <jsn00blah> great that was it!
[09:02:59] <jsn00blah> thx
[09:03:11] <duch_kazatel> sure
[09:03:23] <duch_kazatel> jsn00blah do you understand the difference?
[09:03:43] <jsn00blah> yes, attr is for normal attributes
[09:04:22] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:06:01] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Still I'd need to combine it with Ajax somehow right?
[09:06:11] <frank_o> Or whatever it's called
[09:06:27] <duch_kazatel> frank_o all of your questions so far are about ruby.
[09:06:27] <duch_kazatel> not JS.
[09:06:56] <frank_o> im pretty sure theres a JS element to it which is what I'm asking
[09:07:02] <duch_kazatel> not that i can see.
[09:07:15] <frank_o> ah ok
[09:07:20] <duch_kazatel> the sample code doesn't have any javascript in it.
[09:07:52] <frank_o> no it doesnt, but in order to make the loading of those product photos async so that the entire app loads faster..
[09:08:04] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to change your current problem.
[09:08:13] <duch_kazatel> your issue is that the app loads slowly, right?
[09:08:30] <duch_kazatel> you can use ajax to hit your backend and load new results, but it'll still have the same problems.
[09:09:12] <frank_o> yeah that makes sense
[09:10:28] <frank_o> i guess i have two options, 1) move the fetching of the photos to the client-side and then use ajax.. unfortunately there's no shopsense-jquery lib.. 2) prefetch the photos and serve them locally
[09:10:56] <duch_kazatel> frank_o and number one is only possible if shopsense allows it.
[09:11:24] <frank_o> oh theres that too huh..
[09:11:33] <frank_o> i really appreciate it duch_kazatel thanks a bunch
[09:12:05] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:12:08] <frank_o> btw feel free to snag the code and earn some dollars off that sexy lingerie :D
[09:12:25] <duch_kazatel> lol i earn plenty of dollars off my dayjob tyvm
[09:12:35] <frank_o> hehe
[09:43:34] <duch_kazatel> welp ##javascript has fallen apart of the day
[09:43:44] <duch_kazatel> *for
[09:44:09] <systemfault> It’s not even friday.
[09:44:13] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[09:47:12] <duch_kazatel> i just don't get the excessively dogmatic approach to development.  it's fine to have preferences, and i'm down with ribbing on a language or two.  but the elitism is getting a little absurd.
[09:50:04] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: It’s still not bad on #JavaScript… some other channels are much worse.
[09:50:25] <duch_kazatel> ugh.
[09:55:29] <antlong_> how would i specify to only return keys, that have ints as values in a dict?
[09:55:42] <NaN> hi there
[09:55:59] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ huh?  can you fiddle what you're trying to do?
[09:56:06] <antlong_> duch_kazatel sure, one moment.
[09:56:10] <duch_kazatel> because "int" and "dict" are not javascript concepts ;)
[09:56:14] <antlong_> duch_kazatel rather can i explain the issue im having
[09:56:24] <NaN> is there a way to detect double click on a click event?
[09:56:45] <duch_kazatel> NaN using timeouts, yes. what's the issue you're solving for?
[09:58:52] <tuskkk___> Tuned out Mandrill is useless for me....
[09:58:56] <NaN> duch_kazatel: I'm sending data through a button but some users do a double click so the data is sended twice
[09:59:12] <NoiseEee> NaN: disable the button when its clicked.
[09:59:20] <duch_kazatel> NaN then disab- dammit NoiseEee
[09:59:23] <antlong_> duch_kazatel http://dpaste.com/017VMWK/
[09:59:48] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ this isn't what I asked for.  could you create a jsfiddle that resembles what you want?
[10:00:37] <antlong_> duch_kazatel ... i don't know how. thats the problem. ill try to make something, but i think the problem i wrote is more clear than my pseudo code would be
[10:00:47] <NaN> duch_kazatel, NoiseEee I disable it, but... my users are fast!
[10:00:56] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ fine, let me clarify in a fiddle for you.
[10:02:03] <asido> I have some doms which are dynamically loaded and I want to hide elements matching my selector when they are added the document. is it possible to attach handler so that I could get an event in such case?
[10:02:08] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ so you have something like this, right?
[10:02:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8M7wd/
[10:02:19] <antlong_> duch_kazatel yes exactly
[10:02:28] <NoiseEee> NaN: pretty sure there's a dblclick event
[10:02:30] <antlong_> duch_kazatel sorry, i cant figure out how to get it formatted in console so i can copy paste
[10:02:33] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ okay - fyi there are no "dicts" in js.  there are "objects"
[10:02:58] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ so you want to enumerate through that object and only return those props whose values are numbers?
[10:03:27] <antlong_> duch_kazatel yes
[10:03:56] <antlong_> JSON.stringify($p); may be a good start actually "{"key":"total","clickCount":1,"autoDigCount":1,"manualDigCount":2,"manualGatherCount":2}"
[10:04:00] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:06:21] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ http://jsfiddle.net/8M7wd/1/
[10:06:26] <NaN> thanks NoiseEee
[10:10:36] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ get the idea there?
[10:10:43] <antlong_> duch_kazatel im trying to process it
[10:10:50] <duch_kazatel> what are you stuck on?
[10:10:51] <antlong_> duch_kazatel its not helping that console is not giving me real output
[10:11:00] <duch_kazatel> what is "real output"?
[10:11:13] <systemfault> The opposite of “fake output”
[10:11:18] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:11:49] <antlong_> firebugs console just says 1 2
[10:12:00] <antlong_> so im not exactly seeing the application of this code yet
[10:12:25] <duch_kazatel> you wanted the value of every property that is a number.
[10:13:05] <antlong_> oh i see
[10:13:08] <antlong_> ok i got it now
[10:13:43] <antlong_> i didnt explain myself properly, but i know what i need to adjust in this
[10:14:30] <duch_kazatel> then what do you need?
[10:15:07] <duch_kazatel> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/8M7wd/4/
[10:15:16] <antlong_> i want to filter out irrelevant items that dict; the irrelevant items being the functions, and the key
[10:15:21] <duch_kazatel> Object.
[10:15:31] <antlong_> right sorry
[10:15:32] <antlong_> i come from python
[10:15:36] <duch_kazatel> i can tell ;)
[10:15:44] <duch_kazatel> and don't remove things from that object.
[10:16:08] <antlong_> the purpose here is to make a usable object, so i can add it to the dom as text
[10:16:18] <duch_kazatel> make that object from your backend.
[10:16:30] <antlong_> duch_kazatel this is all clientside
[10:16:59] <duch_kazatel> then don't add your data to that monolithic object in the first place.
[10:17:18] <antlong_> let me see if i can just show you what its for
[10:17:25] <duch_kazatel> don't send me the page btw.
[10:17:34] <duch_kazatel> because that's not going to change my advice ;)
[10:17:47] <keady> man im having a doozie trying to figure this out. i need to select div.form-group that are NOT "display: none" , but i can't use :visible because they might not be visible (eg, a collapsed bootstrap panel) but i still need to select it... any ideas?
[10:17:57] <antlong_> its a statistics object, used for storing your clicks, and items you've found
[10:18:08] <antlong_> each increments appropriately
[10:18:16] <antlong_> clickCount goes up by 1 each time you click
[10:18:26] <duch_kazatel> then why are you attaching methods to data like that?
[10:18:33] <duch_kazatel> where are the functions coming from?
[10:18:37] <antlong_> i didn't, and i don't know if someone did for a reason
[10:19:22] <v2zz> hi! is there any way to access variable in parent scope when you are within $.each() function?
[10:19:34] <duch_kazatel> v2zz yes.  just access it.
[10:19:43] <v2zz> it's invisible
[10:19:50] <v2zz> undefined
[10:20:30] <v2zz> window.myVar is not a good way because i don't want to make dirty global scope
[10:20:32] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ v2zz
[10:20:32] <b-ot> v2zz: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:20:36] <systemfault> v2zz: You’re doing something wrong… In JS, you have access to all the variables of the outer scopes
[10:21:03] <duch_kazatel> v2zz are you sure the variable exists in the parent scope?
[10:21:26] <v2zz> yes, and parent scope is $.each() as well
[10:21:35] <keady> nm, got it having to use $.filter()
[10:21:51] <duch_kazatel> v2zz could you share your code then?
[10:22:40] <antlong_> is there a plugin thats recommended for creating chained modals/dialogs?
[10:22:40] <v2zz> 1 moment
[10:22:58] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ not following.
[10:23:03] <duch_kazatel> "chained modal"?
[10:23:06] <masscrx> hi
[10:23:18] <masscrx> How to rewrite this bad function : $("fieldset.item").not(" [style='display: none;' ").each(function()
[10:23:32] <masscrx> i want to select all fieldset without style (which are visible)
[10:23:36] <v2zz> http://jsbin.com/kexakinu/1/
[10:23:46] <antlong_> duch_kazatel i need modals/dialogue thats have arrows to go through screens, my use case, is creating conversation, or quests where you may need to page through the contents
[10:23:46] <duch_kazatel> masscrx store things in variables.
[10:24:44] <masscrx> ok but I need some selector for this
[10:24:52] <tuskkk___> can someone invite me to #Java?
[10:24:54] <duch_kazatel> masscrx that's your selector.
[10:25:06] <duch_kazatel> tuskkk___ this channel has nothing to do with #java
[10:25:21] <thebope> tuskkk___, you want ##java
[10:25:26] <thebope> #java doesn't exist
[10:25:30] <tuskkk___> I know, but someone might be a member
[10:25:42] <tuskkk___> thebope: Ok
[10:25:48] <duch_kazatel> v2zz this code has nothing to do with your question...
[10:25:50] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [style='display: none;'
[10:26:07] <systemfault> tuskkk___: Some channels need your nickname to be registered in order to access them.
[10:26:22] <thebope> in this case though #java doesn't exist
[10:26:24] <v2zz> duch_kazatel i need to get 'div' variable inside of second .each()
[10:26:28] <tuskkk___> systemfault: yes, got in!
[10:26:31] <systemfault> thebope: ##Java exists.
[10:26:34] <thebope> although I wouldn't be surprised ##java doesn't require registration
[10:26:35] <duch_kazatel> v2zz then just reference div
[10:26:45] <thebope> systemfault, yea of course
[10:26:51] <tuskkk___> its requires registration
[10:26:53] <thebope> We can hash this out
[10:26:55] <tuskkk___> it*
[10:26:55] <thebope> ;-)
[10:27:03] <thebope> Yea, register at freenode
[10:27:11] <tuskkk___> is there any way to auto identify every time?
[10:27:15] <duch_kazatel> masscrx ah that's your problem.  you want everything that is hidden with display: none;?
[10:27:35] <duch_kazatel> or rather, everything that isn't hidden?
[10:28:00] <systemfault> masscrx: Your problem is caused by the usage of 2 evil functions in jQuery (.show() and .hide()), you wouldn’t have that problem if you used classes instead.
[10:28:07] <thebope> systemfault, is there a specific difference between # and ##?
[10:28:27] <duch_kazatel> masscrx $("fieldset.item").not(':hidden')
[10:28:34] <v2zz> duch_kazatel  it's typeof div =='undefined'	
[10:28:35] <duch_kazatel> thebope # is for projects, ## for topics.
[10:28:37] <masscrx> yeah but i see my fault, where you see .show or .hide in my selector ?
[10:28:43] <systemfault> thebope: Yes, one #  means “official”. Two ## is for topic channels.
[10:29:00] <thebope> Ahh, I see so jquery is a project but javascript and java are topics
[10:29:05] <thebope> thanks duch_kazatel and systemfault
[10:29:27] <systemfault> thebope: Basically, for #Java to exists, Oracle would have to ask freenode to give them… and they would moderate the channel.
[10:29:40] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: this doesnt work, jquery sends data from hidden inputs
[10:29:45] <thebope> lol its funny #web is a project. Very true but funny
[10:29:48] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ masscrx
[10:29:48] <b-ot> masscrx: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:29:53] <thebope> that makes sense
[10:29:57] <thebope> Does Jquery moderate here?
[10:30:00] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:30:03] <thebope> oh wow
[10:30:08] <duch_kazatel> some members of the team, at least.
[10:30:12] <BillCriswell> Looking at Google's jQuery "Community" in Google+... wow
[10:30:15] <thebope> I never knew. That's really cool
[10:30:25] <thebope> BillCriswell, Is it strong?
[10:30:27] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: I dont need to use for one line jsfiddle: $("fieldset.item").not(':hidden').each(function()
[10:30:36] <BillCriswell> thebope: It's terrible haha
[10:30:38] <paulvd> lol
[10:30:40] <thebope> lol
[10:30:46] <duch_kazatel> masscrx i have no idea wtf you're tryivng to do any more.
[10:31:00] <BillCriswell> Just one guy calling everyone an idiot basically... which he's not wrong... but still.
[10:31:00] <paulvd> masscrx: sometimes even a one line code can be wrong
[10:31:11] <masscrx> <fieldset class="item" style="display: none;">
[10:31:14] <duch_kazatel> go read the docs - that line will loop through every $("fieldset.item") that isn't :hidden
[10:31:14] <thebope> It sounds like he's looking for fieldsets of class item that aren't hidden that he'd like to do something too
[10:31:26] <systemfault> masscrx: Add/Remove classes to your elements  instead of simply hiding them,  you’ll avoid that whole class of problems.
[10:31:27] <masscrx> this is hidden fieldset, and I dont wanna include them in selector
[10:31:33] <BillCriswell> People who have no idea what they're doing trying to write XML files with jQuery.
[10:31:41] <thebope> hahaha
[10:31:45] <thebope> why would you do that
[10:31:52] <masscrx> systemfault: Yeah I know about it, but this action is made by rails gem
[10:31:57] <thebope> is that like a thing I missed somewhere along the way
[10:31:58] <paulvd> BillCriswell: which thread is it
[10:32:02] <masscrx> I dont have time to rewrite external libs
[10:32:21] <systemfault> masscrx: Sucks :/
[10:32:36] <BillCriswell> paulvd: All of them.
[10:32:45] <duch_kazatel> masscrx http://jsfiddle.net/tnfeB/ works here as expected.
[10:33:24] <tuskkk___> but them how come #books is a project?
[10:33:29] <tuskkk___> then*
[10:33:36] <duch_kazatel> because somebody reg'd it as a project.
[10:33:55] <duch_kazatel> or that room was set up and got popular enough that freenode didn't want to change it.
[10:34:01] <duch_kazatel> #music and ##music are like that.
[10:34:21] <tuskkk___> books has just 16 people
[10:34:31] <tuskkk___> 90% are inactive
[10:34:41] <duch_kazatel> probably flying under the radar?
[10:35:00] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: I think that action which make fieldset as hidden is fired after jquery selector is looking for
[10:35:17] <duch_kazatel> masscrx huh?
[10:35:52] <masscrx> I have some function which makes call to backend, so I bind .on click to link which removes element
[10:36:25] <duch_kazatel> still not following.  what does that have to do with your question?
[10:36:25] <masscrx> so, when I click 'remove' $("fieldset.item").not(':hidden').each(function() is fired first
[10:36:37] <duch_kazatel> i need to see more code then, because something isn't clicking.
[10:36:40] <masscrx> and second fieldset is hidden
[10:36:46] <thebope> who goes on IRC to talk about books?
[10:37:01] <thebope> I guess you answered that, 16 mostly inactive people
[10:37:33] <thebope> I can't imagine the thought "Oh man. I just finished 'Confederacy of Dunces' Let me go talk about the Jesus figure with the guys on IRC"
[10:37:40] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:37:44] <masscrx> haha
[10:37:44] <duch_kazatel> some folks are like that.
[10:38:00] <thebope> lol
[10:38:22] <thebope> by the way
[10:38:43] <thebope> that book is really good. Reading it for the second time. There's not much better, or funnier
[10:39:14] <duch_kazatel> and here's somebody who wants to talk about a book on irc
[10:39:21] <thebope> ;-)
[10:39:25] <thebope> I realized the irony myself
[10:39:50] <decx> are you bashing nerds who go on irc on irc?
[10:40:01] <thebope> lol be quiet decx
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah mean people who hang out on irc all day are such gigantic nerds.
[10:40:26] <duch_kazatel> s/mean/man
[10:40:32] <thebope> are you on irc asking about nerds who bash nerds who go on irc on irc?
[10:40:40] <duch_kazatel> (yodawg)
[10:40:44] <decx> my new name is el cognito diconando
[10:40:45] <thebope> hahaha
[10:40:52] <drej> hey general javascript question someone in here might know the answer to...
[10:41:09] <duch_kazatel> prolly
[10:41:10] <drej> http://jsfiddle.net/Fcdqa/3/ in that example, how would i get the offsetTop based on the <main> element, rather than the immediate container which is positioned
[10:41:35] <drej> offsetTop of the input that is, not of <main> itself
[10:41:37] <duch_kazatel> you want the offset from <main>
[10:41:56] <drej> yeah, but i mean, not specifically main, the number of nested elements varies
[10:42:02] <drej> i can set a class or something on that container
[10:42:06] <drej> as a hook
[10:42:15] <drej> but i cant traverse x amount of elements to the parent always
[10:42:22] <drej> and also dont have jquery at my disposal
[10:42:23] <drej> :)
[10:42:55] <duch_kazatel> grab the offsetTop of main and subtract that from the offsetTop of your input.
[10:43:05] <decx> stack dat offset yo
[10:43:08] <drej> well
[10:43:16] <drej> uhmm let me put together a better example
[10:43:38] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: I've done with setTimeout, but this is not a perfect solution I think
[10:44:09] <duch_kazatel> masscrx no idea what you're using settimeout for.
[10:44:47] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/LJcH0jAb
[10:45:05] <duch_kazatel> why?
[10:45:15] <duch_kazatel> what does TotalSum(); do?
[10:45:32] <duch_kazatel> no clue what your doing or why.  lots of unrelated woo going on here.
[10:45:35] <masscrx> this is js function to the backend for total sum of items in page
[10:46:11] <duch_kazatel> need a more complete example duder.
[10:46:45] <masscrx> I use set timeout, because I have external libs which manage nested fields of form, so when I click 'remove' this external lib remove fields from page by setting style="display: none"
[10:47:02] <duch_kazatel> still not making sense.
[10:47:12] <drej> duch_kazatel ok here, http://jsfiddle.net/Fcdqa/7/
[10:47:26] <duch_kazatel> masscrx just make the example :)
[10:47:27] <drej> lets say on, on focus of that input, iw ant to scroll <main> to have the input at the top of it
[10:47:29] <masscrx> so when i bind .on click to my 'remove' link, this action is fired BEFORE fields are removed by display none
[10:47:37] <drej> so i need to figure out the input's offsetTop within <main>
[10:47:42] <duch_kazatel> masscrx okay, what's the external lib?
[10:48:03] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/lailsonbm/awesome_nested_fields
[10:48:15] <duch_kazatel> drej yeah, you want the input's offset from main.
[10:48:17] <duch_kazatel> same answer as before.
[10:48:36] <drej> offsetTop of main is only 20px
[10:48:46] <drej> subtracting that from 1
[10:48:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:48:51] <drej> which is the current offsetTop of the input
[10:48:53] <drej> doesnt get me what i need
[10:48:53] <masscrx> oo I see some callbacks, so maybe I'll change this js libs
[10:49:03] <duch_kazatel> masscrx there you go.
[10:49:24] <duch_kazatel> something seems wrong here, drej
[10:50:11] <duch_kazatel> drej what browsers do you need to support?
[10:50:15] <drej> webkit
[10:50:24] <duch_kazatel> reasonably recent?
[10:50:31] <drej> mobile only, ios and android, all recent
[10:50:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Fcdqa/8/
[10:51:01] <duch_kazatel> getBoundingClientRect() might be what you need.
[10:51:31] <drej> hrm interesting
[10:51:46] <drej> that is.. what exactly?
[10:51:51] <drej> whatever overflow parent is ?
[10:51:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:52:31] <drej> i mean the values its giving me looks like its based on the containing <body>
[10:52:33] <drej> not <main>
[10:52:37] <duch_kazatel> right.
[10:52:40] <duch_kazatel> same logic as before.
[10:52:57] <drej> subtract the <main> offset from that
[10:53:01] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:53:02] <drej> hrm
[10:53:16] <systemfault> drej: http://jsfiddle.net/Fcdqa/9/ ?
[10:53:37] <duch_kazatel> ooh there you go.
[10:53:42] <drej> nice
[10:55:05] <duch_kazatel> yaaay code review
[10:55:20] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Good luck :)
[10:55:42] <duch_kazatel> this is actually round 2 for this dude.
[10:56:22] <duch_kazatel> lots of potential.  he's learning well.
[10:56:30] <systemfault> Good :)
[10:57:04] <drej> thanks systemfault and duch_kazatel
[10:57:11] <systemfault> You’re welcome :)
[10:57:24] <drej> weird mobile issues heh
[10:57:35] <drej> basically i have to scroll the inputs to a specific place in the screen so that they keyboard of the device doesnt overlay it
[10:57:50] <duch_kazatel> drej those are always fun.
[10:57:55] <drej> android problem only, ios seems to be smarter about it, it automatically scrolls the container
[10:58:03] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:58:09] <drej> android does it too, but because its a nested, absolutely positioned container, it fails
[10:58:17] <drej> if its just body scroll, its fine
[10:59:52] <drej> the first full-on hybrid mobile app im building
[10:59:56] <drej> lots of interesting challenges
[11:30:12] <farn5w0rth> If I copy and paste a paragraph into a textarea input box, how do I convert each word into a tag? Ie. if I copy a long list of emails from Excel, I want it to split the emails into individual tags…?
[11:31:12] <duch_kazatel> farn5w0rth whaaaaa why
[11:31:55] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: so if the user wants to edit the form later, they can remove emails easily
[11:31:59] <farn5w0rth> duch_lunch:
[11:32:52] <Fraz> hey
[11:33:03] <farn5w0rth> duch_lunch: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/#custom-width-support
[11:33:03] <Fraz> anyone around know much about transit?
[11:33:15] <farn5w0rth> Fraz: how do you mean?
[11:33:58] <Fraz> well, im trying to transition multiple properties seperately. any idea if this is possible?
[11:34:32] <Fraz> ive disabled the queue, but the second transition always overrides the duration of the first it seems
[11:35:54] <Fraz> something along the lines of $('someelem').transition({ x: 500, duration: 5000}); $('someelem').transition({ opacity: 0, duration: 1000});
[11:36:00] <farn5w0rth> Fraz: sorry i thought you were talking about transit as a mode of transport ie buses
[11:36:07] <Fraz> lol
[11:36:11] <farn5w0rth> ha
[12:00:19] <CloudsDew> What i do wrong here?
[12:00:19] <CloudsDew>    jQuery('#lines').scrollTop(jQuery("#linetop_1").position().top) but #lines won't scroll to #linetop_1 into view
[12:06:53] <mark_t> What's a selector that returns ".foo" *or* ".bar" class?
[12:08:23] <mark_t> Oh, comma. Should have tried that before asking.
[12:10:11] <gdrc> so there's no way to post json with content-type header set to 'application/json' with jquery.
[12:24:43] <shoky> gdrc why not
[12:24:55] <gdrc> tried all the day
[12:25:03] <shoky> contentType: 'application/json'
[12:25:19] <gdrc> with contentType the call did not start
[12:25:33] <shoky> show your code
[12:26:04] <gdrc> I home at home now. But it's very simple call
[12:27:26] <shoky> gdrc: http://jsfiddle.net/V6MGx/   works fine
[12:28:46] <gdrc> shoky: yeah same code with + crossdomain: true
[12:30:59] <shoky> gdrc: you hardly ever need to use the crossDomain option. jquery and the browser will figure it out. with crossdomain requests the server needs to specifically allow crossdomain requests to it
[12:31:49] <shoky> but anyway it's as simple as in my jsfiddle, if the server allows it via CORS headers
[12:35:30] <konda> Hey, Im trying to get a lightbox in Jquery to work. If someone could help me Id be greatful! The fadeout function doesnt work for some reaseon. Here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/konda/k7FPT/
[12:36:06] <duch_kazatel> konda bind your second listener outside of the img click.
[12:36:37] <duch_kazatel> and use event delegation instead.
[12:38:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/k7FPT/1/
[12:38:52] <konda> Ah okey, I was gonna say Im gonna give it a try but you solved it :) Thanks alot :)
[12:39:16] <duch_kazatel> also: you were trying to bind a listener to a fragment, not to the element in the DOM.
[12:39:56] <konda> ah fragment you mean the overlay variable?
[12:40:07] <duch_kazatel> i mean $(overlay)
[12:40:16] <konda> yes okey,
[12:40:32] <konda> I had a problem reaching the element to fade it out :)
[12:40:43] <konda> but you solved it with the whole body I guess?
[12:40:50] <duch_kazatel> right.  so you either bind to the fragment and append that first, or use event delegation.
[12:41:13] <duch_kazatel> i used event delegation in the example i showed you.
[12:41:25] <duch_kazatel> usually you don't bind to body like that, but that illustrates the idea.
[12:42:03] <konda> okey
[12:42:09] <konda> I see you put the .on function in there
[12:42:18] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:42:29] <duch_kazatel> .click() calls .on()
[12:42:29] <konda> Im quite a beginner, so im gonna read about delegation and .on
[12:42:38] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use delegation, you need to use .on()
[12:43:54] <konda> ah okey
[12:43:57] <konda> Ill play around with it
[12:44:01] <konda> thanks alot!
[12:44:04] <duch_kazatel> yep
[12:45:22] <logikos> i'm trying to stop propagation in the header of an accordion: http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/qjnaA
[12:45:33] <logikos> that obviously isnt working... what am i missing?
[12:45:52] <duch_kazatel> stopprop isn't a legitimate selector.
[12:45:55] <duch_kazatel> i think you mean .stopprop
[12:45:58] <logikos> nargas: stop spaming
[12:46:08] <duch_kazatel> nargas is a bot.
[12:46:43] <logikos> the bot is msging links on join of this chan
[12:46:54] <duch_kazatel> and also randomly after the fast.
[12:46:55] <duch_kazatel> *fact
[12:47:13] <logikos> duch_kazatel: i changed it to .stopprop and the problem still exists
[12:47:36] <logikos> obviously my selecter was wrong before but even when its correct it still doesnt work as expected
[12:48:59] <duch_kazatel> oh woah that's...
[12:49:05] <duch_kazatel> i see what you're trying to do.
[12:49:44] <logikos> great, now how do i do it?
[12:49:46] <logikos> ltlol
[12:49:50] <logikos> -lt
[12:50:00] <duch_kazatel> first, why are you sturcturing your markup like that?
[12:50:27] <logikos> this is just a simple example to represent a problem
[12:50:47] <duch_kazatel> right - why are you structuring your markup so that only part of the heading is a legitimate place to click?
[12:51:42] <logikos> duch_kazatel: because i have input tags inside the header
[12:51:55] <logikos> doesnt really mater why i'm doing it
[12:52:05] <logikos> just need to know how to stop the propgation
[12:52:22] <duch_kazatel> 9/10 people are looking to do really strange things they don't need to do.  that's why it matters
[12:52:27] <duch_kazatel> let me poke this a bit morw.
[12:52:59] <frank_o> greetings duch_kazatel !!
[12:53:05] <frank_o> whats good in your neighborhood
[12:53:08] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:53:09] <logikos> duch_kazatel: i can understand that, for me to explain exactly how i'm using this would take some effort and not really profit the conversation any...
[12:53:17] <logikos> ty for looking into it
[12:53:22] <frank_o> nargas: dont spam me man
[12:53:27] <duch_kazatel> frank_o it's a bot.
[12:53:38] <logikos> it doesnt mater that its a bot, kick it
[12:53:39] <frank_o> yup
[12:53:41] <frank_o> some live cam show
[12:53:42] <logikos> ban it...
[12:53:49] <duch_kazatel> logikos nothing i can do about it.
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> yaaay shoky
[12:53:58] <frank_o> the man
[12:54:10] <vladikoff> i  don't even see the bot, weeeird
[12:54:20] <duch_kazatel> it was PMing people.
[12:54:49] <duch_kazatel> logikos you might need to rethink your strategy here - i can't see a way to get this to work the way you want.
[12:54:55] <duch_kazatel> you might need to wire things up manually.
[12:55:20] <logikos> that sucks....
[12:55:28] <duch_kazatel> what you're tyring to do is pretty unusual.
[12:55:28] * drej hugs vladikoff 
[12:55:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qQ4GV/
[12:56:35] <duch_kazatel> only shoky has an idea.
[12:56:41] <duch_kazatel> *unless
[13:01:57] <shoky> well
[13:02:34] <shoky> logikos is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/qQ4GV/2/
[13:02:58] <duch_kazatel> why didn't that work with the delegated handler?
[13:03:14] <shoky> cause by the time it reached body, jquery-ui has already handled it
[13:03:18] <logikos> yes, what did you do different from me?
[13:03:19] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaah
[13:03:37] <shoky> logikos: using a direct event listener on the .stopprop element, instead of delegating it to <body>
[13:04:23] <duch_kazatel> shoky i delegated it.
[13:04:35] <logikos> i see, that will work except i also intend to dynamically add rows...
[13:04:36] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm i didn't.
[13:04:37] <duch_kazatel> derp
[13:04:37] <shoky> yeah, i just looked at the last fiddle you posted
[13:04:43] <duch_kazatel> http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/qjnaA
[13:04:44] <logikos> not sure how that will affect things
[13:04:45] <duch_kazatel> this is the original.
[13:04:46] <logikos> but ok
[13:08:06] <shoky> logikos ah you're gonna add more rows, then it won't work just like that
[13:08:37] <duch_kazatel> you could bind listeners directly to the fragments and then append the fragments.
[13:09:11] <logikos> shoky: yeah, i'll have reset the bind after adding each row
[13:09:17] <logikos> i'm guessing
[13:09:19] <logikos> not there yet
[13:09:26] <duch_kazatel> or bind to the fragment and then append the fragments.
[13:09:27] <logikos> ty for your help
[13:09:54] <logikos> hmm yeah, that would work .. but it would result in more binds
[13:10:00] <logikos> not sure if that is preferable or not?
[13:10:05] <duch_kazatel> you don't have a choice.
[13:10:28] <logikos> wont mater much for this case anyways
[13:10:36] <duch_kazatel> it's a tradeoff.  a little more overhead up front with a little less overhead on click.
[13:11:24] <logikos> yeah, thank you both for your help .. time to go home.. more work tomorrow lol
[13:16:22] <drej> duch_kazatel looks like i didnt have to do anything to begin with
[13:16:24] <drej> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.scrollIntoView
[13:16:31] <duch_kazatel> drej hahahahahaha ouch
[13:16:39] <drej> hahaha crap
[13:18:23] <drej> systemfault cc
[13:18:39] <systemfault> :)
[13:19:51] <BillCriswell> I couldn't believe element.scrollIntoView existed the first time I came across it.
[13:20:06] <drej> BillCriswell its a new one to me man
[13:20:14] <drej> its really handy on mobile
[13:20:23] <drej> i was trying to solve it manually then saw that it existed
[13:20:27] <shoky> never noticed that alighWithTop argument
[13:20:38] <BillCriswell> drej: You know what's another good one? document.activeElement
[13:21:14] <shoky> also document.elementFromPoint <3
[13:21:26] <drej> neat
[13:21:33] <BillCriswell> Never heard of that one shoky.
[13:21:35] <drej> so many fancy new things i can use
[13:21:59] <__joshua___> I had never heard of scrollIntoView until just now
[13:22:13] <duch_kazatel> drej++
[13:22:20] <duch_kazatel> blowin' minds left and right today
[13:22:36] <drej> yay
[13:22:43] <drej> it only took 8 years of lurking!
[13:22:50] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:22:51] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:26:12] <BillCriswell> shoky: This elementFromPoint is interesting.
[13:26:30] <BillCriswell> It seems useful but I'm struggling to find a use case.
[13:28:18] <drej> lol eyah
[13:28:24] <drej> i had to read the first summary sentence like 5 times
[13:28:27] <drej> BillCriswell
[13:28:50] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/lokahelo/2/edit?html,css,js,output if anyone wants to mess with it.
[13:29:49] <drej> that would've come in handy when i was trying to get pointer events to click through something
[13:29:56] <drej> for older browsers that dont support pointer-events: none;
[13:30:07] <drej> although older browsers probably dont support this method
[13:31:57] <BillCriswell> Weird timing, looked at this OOK page from 06/2010 and it was last changed today: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/more_ie9_goodne.html
[13:31:59] <BillCriswell> PPK*
[13:34:59] <shoky> BillCriswell yeah i used it for a similar case to what drej was saying, when pointer-events was not enough
[13:35:42] <shoky> i had to find the 2nd-topmost element at the clicked point
[13:36:34] <shoky> so hid the topmost, got document.elementFromPoint, and made the topmost visible again. hackish but i couldnt get it working any other way
[13:36:52] <BillCriswell> Sounds like it must have been fun.
[13:37:35] <shoky> oh yes it was a thrill ;S
[13:37:44] <thebope> That reminds me of the Walther PPK
[13:37:51] <thebope> Its like a gun in James bond or something
[13:38:05] <thebope> oh its a real gun
[13:38:13] <thebope> http://www.waltherarms.com/products/handguns/ppk/#.U5i-MPgoZpg
[13:38:15] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[13:40:53] <Hyperking> Can google earth geocode api be used in a commercial app?
[13:43:14] <troop> how can i include file to my page ( i want to control my menu and links from one place without serverside including, if possible)
[13:43:40] <duch_kazatel> troop err, why not?
[13:44:00] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#tos_commercial
[13:44:17] <duch_kazatel> troop the overhead and doing it another way doesn't really make sense.
[13:45:00] <drej> oh oh , go SHTML route!
[13:45:06] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:45:08] <drej> :)
[13:45:08] <troop> duch_kazatel i'm trying to include my menu and submenus via jquery load function but then accordeon menus dont work because elements dont load to dom
[13:45:24] <duch_kazatel> troop they actually DO "load to DOM".
[13:45:28] <duch_kazatel> if you see it, it's in the DOM.
[13:45:44] <duch_kazatel> your issue is it's not initializing because it's coming in after pageload.
[13:45:53] <duch_kazatel> just include them serverside.
[13:45:54] <troop> hmm
[13:45:58] <drej> troop you just cant bind your events on page load, you have to do them after you pull int eh content
[13:46:01] <duch_kazatel> why NOT use server side.
[13:46:14] <drej> serverside is the best way to go in this case
[13:46:18] <duch_kazatel> definitely.
[13:46:21] <drej> unless they're contextual menus or content or something
[13:46:24] <troop> using php or something isnt funny for only including menu?
[13:46:36] <duch_kazatel> there are also straight-up server-side includes.
[13:46:45] <duch_kazatel> what server are you using?
[13:46:52] <duch_kazatel> apache?
[13:47:00] <troop> i think they would use node
[13:47:03] <drej> if you have server restrictions, you can alwys use a pre-processor
[13:47:05] <drej> like jekyll
[13:47:06] <troop> there is no server yet
[13:47:16] <duch_kazatel> wtf if you're using node then use that...
[13:47:32] <duch_kazatel> you can use node to handle this for you.
[13:47:58] <troop> okay i will ask them for server
[13:47:59] <troop> thanks
[13:48:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:48:51] <troop> im not sure what server they would use, im only doing pure html pages
[13:49:03] <duch_kazatel> you said they're using node right?
[13:49:21] <troop> i said i think they would use node server
[13:49:24] <troop> i guess
[13:49:54] <duch_kazatel> you can do this through node pretty easily.  or through a static side generator.  or through apache...
[13:50:32] <troop> ok im looking thanks for information
[13:50:36] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:51:08] <drej> i usually outsource the preprocessing to romania
[13:51:10] <drej> :)
[13:51:15] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[14:06:45] <Jattenalle> http://gabegaming.com/ confirmed for june 19th, gentlemen prepare your wallets
[14:08:02] <onenine90> Hey guys. Lookin for a little shared experiences here. Would you guys say when using $('#example').on('click', function() {}); type event handlers (i've got about 30 in my app.js file
[14:08:15] <onenine90> Would u guys say you should always call another function from within that event function?
[14:08:25] <onenine90> I tend to sometimes write the function within the event function itself
[14:08:37] <Jattenalle> onenine90, yes
[14:08:52] <Jattenalle> if nothing else, it makes the code cleaner, and avoids potential mistakes/leaked contexts
[14:08:58] <onenine90> Jattenalle I wonder, if there is a more clean way to lay out all the event handlers
[14:09:07] <onenine90> there are a bunch, but of course i do not want to do them onclick inline
[14:09:18] <onenine90> and I will remove my functions so they are not within the event functions
[14:09:28] <Jattenalle> well you could have an actual function, that checks which button/whatever did the click
[14:09:30] <onenine90> but still, there are a handful of them at the bottom of my app.js file
[14:09:32] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 are you repeating the same logic over and over?
[14:10:20] <onenine90> duch_kazatel it varies quite a bit.
[14:10:25] <Jattenalle> something like, $('.someclass').click(myspecialfunction).. then have myspecialfunction sort it all out.. at least then you'd have it all in one place.. if it's better or not, depends on what your code is doing
[14:10:32] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 because it entirely depends on your case
[14:10:40] <duch_kazatel> event delegtion is a good thing.
[14:11:21] <onenine90> Jattenalle I like that idea
[14:11:37] <duch_kazatel> just be careful how far you take that idea, onenine90
[14:11:43] <Jattenalle> just keep in mind that one function with 30+ branching conditionals might also end up being a mess
[14:11:44] <onenine90> thank you duch_kazatel  i am looking into delegation
[14:11:51] <Jattenalle> like i said, it all depends on what your code is doing
[14:12:07] <Jattenalle> you might want to split simillar buttons into one function, others into another function and so on
[14:12:14] <onenine90> Jattenalle I think a good idea would be like, maybe group all my event handlers that relate to changing the interface into one function like that
[14:12:19] <Jattenalle> but it'd beat having an "inline" function for every single button
[14:12:30] <Jattenalle> yeah
[14:12:34] <duch_kazatel> maybe.
[14:13:24] <onenine90> thanks 4 the feedback u 2
[14:14:52] <onenine90> Another question guys. One thing I've done in the past, is name, say for example, all my buttons that are used in the text manipulator with a class of "btnEditText"
[14:15:04] <onenine90> I would then use a data attribtue to specify the type of edit it is
[14:15:14] <Jattenalle> that's fine
[14:15:16] <onenine90> such as "bold" or "italic" or "text align"
[14:15:31] <onenine90> then I use one event handler using the $('.btnEditText') selector
[14:15:38] <onenine90> Jattenalle does that seem like a good practice?
[14:15:46] <Jattenalle> it's what i do, it sure is nice
[14:15:48] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.  or use a single parent and delegate the clicks for all the children.
[14:15:52] <onenine90> awesome
[14:16:13] <onenine90> duch_kazatel I used to use a single parent like that, but then I got paranoid that the designer I would work with would change things up
[14:16:23] <duch_kazatel> then you tell them to not ;)
[14:16:30] <onenine90> :D
[14:16:42] <Jattenalle> i prefer the class trick simply because then you can move things around without having to worry
[14:16:48] <Jattenalle> move things around in the layout i mean
[14:17:14] <onenine90> Jattenalle that is why you prefer the data attribute?
[14:17:23] <onenine90> oh nvm
[14:17:25] <onenine90> ya nice
[14:17:35] <Jattenalle> i dont use data all that much, but yeah the select by class
[14:17:43] <Jattenalle> as opposed to select by parent
[14:17:51] <onenine90> hmm
[14:17:58] <duch_kazatel> i guess i'm used to implementing designs and hooking up the logic.
[14:18:02] <onenine90> so we are not talking about buttons now Jattenalle
[14:18:10] <Jattenalle> we are onenine90
[14:18:17] <onenine90> because if they all have the same class name, how do you differentiate?
[14:18:21] <onenine90> id="" ?
[14:18:24] <duch_kazatel> the data attributes on them.
[14:18:33] <onenine90> yikes
[14:18:56] <onenine90> <Jattenalle>	 i dont use data all that much
[14:19:05] <onenine90> i was asking how he differentiates if he doesn't use data
[14:19:21] <duch_kazatel> other classes, IDs, etc.
[14:19:35] <Jattenalle> i dont have the same class on them, i do something along the lines of: <button class="RES UI_IDENTIFIER"></button>, so "RES" is the "this is a button with these properties", and "UI_IDENTIFIER" is the exact type of button that is
[14:19:44] <kegster> hey so when im using wp_editor what's the best way to process it before storing so i can then drop it back in the wp_editor? without the html changing, etc
[14:19:49] <kegster> or w/e wp editor does heh
[14:19:59] <duch_kazatel> kegster wp editor?
[14:20:05] <Jattenalle> so for example : <button class="RES AA"></button> <button class="RES BB"></button>
[14:20:32] <kegster> .c wp_editor > duch_kazatel
[14:20:33] <b-ot> kegster: Sorry, I can't find anything on wp_editor+>+duch_kazatel
[14:20:34] <kegster> or the_editor()
[14:20:37] <kegster> oops
[14:20:39] <kegster> wrong channel
[14:20:40] <kegster> sry
[14:20:42] <Jattenalle> lol
[14:20:45] <duch_kazatel> i was about to say lol
[14:20:53] <kegster> client auto joins channels on delay sob
[14:23:31] <synti> hello guys, i have this code but its show just one post i want to show 3 posts can anyone help me please? http://pastebin.com/JPc8AA31
[14:23:53] <onenine90> Jattenalle can you give me another example of your class naming
[14:24:16] <onenine90> maybe a real life example u have worked on? with an interface with different buttons and other ui elements to interact with an application
[14:24:21] <onenine90> I really appreciate your insights
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> synti ... pretty simple/.  what specifically are you having a hard time with?
[14:24:59] <Jattenalle> onenine90, i'm far from a pro... but sure, just view source on this for example http://gaicdn.com/v/layoutSelect_Planet.html
[14:25:15] <synti> duch_kazatel i dont know how to show more than 1 post :(
[14:25:30] <duch_kazatel> synti right - so what have you tried?
[14:25:40] <synti> i read little about .each function but unlycky
[14:25:43] <onenine90> thank u
[14:25:54] <onenine90> $.each function is great synti
[14:25:54] <synti> i dont know how to adapt with my code
[14:25:59] <onenine90> what are ya trying to do synti
[14:26:04] <duch_kazatel> synti your .success() needs to use a loop.
[14:26:08] <onenine90> iterate over dom elements, or iterate over an array?
[14:26:14] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 http://pastebin.com/JPc8AA31
[14:26:18] <duch_kazatel> they want to do three out of this.
[14:26:19] <duch_kazatel> trivial.
[14:26:23] <duch_kazatel> but let them learn ;)
[14:26:55] <synti> duch_kazatel: i learn that need a loop but i dont know how to make a loop in json
[14:27:17] <duch_kazatel> synti response.posts[0]
[14:27:52] <duch_kazatel> you'd do a loop over the posts
[14:27:59] <duch_kazatel> you said you only want three, right?
[14:28:15] <synti> yes
[14:28:31] <duch_kazatel> okay - so how would you write a loop that goes through three things only?
[14:29:26] <synti> i can limited on the json link with &number=3 i think :/
[14:29:34] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i asked.
[14:30:03] <synti> thats a point that i dont know how to write a loop
[14:30:18] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/RKZ8C/1/
[14:30:23] <duch_kazatel> that's how you write a loop.
[14:30:59] <synti> yes that iam trying now: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16607172/loop-through-json-response-in-jquery
[14:31:10] <duch_kazatel> slow down.
[14:31:34] <synti> ok
[14:31:47] <duch_kazatel> you're jumping everywhere without actually trying to understand wtf you're doing.
[14:32:44] <synti> ok sry
[14:32:53] <duch_kazatel> how would you apply that for loop to what you're trying to do?
[14:33:44] <synti> i dont know
[14:34:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/RKZ8C/2/
[14:34:32] <duch_kazatel> now this code will function
[14:34:39] <duch_kazatel> but it won't work the way you want it to.
[14:35:16] <synti> how do u mean?
[14:35:33] <duch_kazatel> think about it - read the code.
[14:37:28] <synti> i understand it i think becouse this gone respond 3 posts and the html code cant display it? right?
[14:37:39] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:37:49] <thebope> lol
[14:37:51] <thebope> sorry
[14:38:02] <duch_kazatel> you're doing this $('#content').attr('href', response.posts[i].URL);
[14:38:05] <duch_kazatel> three times in a row.
[14:38:17] <duch_kazatel> there can only ever be one #content.
[14:38:53] <synti> oh
[14:39:06] <duch_kazatel> gotta walk before you can crawl ;)
[14:39:09] <duch_kazatel> err,
[14:39:10] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[14:39:13] <duch_kazatel> derpingtons.
[14:42:45] <synti> ufff :( i dont know i stuck
[14:43:04] <duch_kazatel> synti how much programming experience do you have?
[14:43:44] <synti> i just make a couple of wordpress site i dont know to much about programming duch_kazatel
[14:44:15] <duch_kazatel> probably a good time to learn then :)
[14:45:24] <synti> i understand when i read a ready code but i cant write it by myself from beggining :(
[14:46:06] <duch_kazatel> i have a terribly difficult time believing you "learn from example"
[14:46:26] <duch_kazatel> but whatever - what element are you appending things to?
[14:51:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/AghfM/
[14:51:49] <duch_kazatel> you'll wind up with something that builds off this concept.
[14:55:54] <antlong_> How do i use a string to do the lookup here? http://jsfiddle.net/y37Sy/
[14:56:23] <shoky> antlong_: like that, just missing a .
[14:57:09] <antlong_> wow
[14:57:10] <antlong_> thanks
[14:58:02] <antlong_> shoky i dont think this will work either
[14:59:06] <duch_kazatel> the syntax is right.
[14:59:16] <jParkton> I need some help on a beginner js function
[14:59:30] <antlong_> SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
[14:59:52] <jParkton> the book I am following has this as a recursive funct to calculate power http://hastebin.com/jimulapago.js but that seems wrong to me
[15:00:19] <antlong_> i need game.planets["1"]  and i think its just giving me 1?
[15:00:42] <shoky> antlong_: show your code
[15:01:00] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ game.planets[game.currentPlanet.data.name].storage.hasItem('miningRig');
[15:02:37] <antlong_> http://jsfiddle.net/y37Sy/1/
[15:02:42] <shoky> jParkton: well it's not wrong (assuming exp is non-negative)
[15:02:47] <antlong_> let me know if it doesn't make sense
[15:03:00] <duch_kazatel> game.planets[game.currentPlanet.data.id].storage.hasItem('miningRig');
[15:03:05] <duch_kazatel> you added one too many periods.
[15:03:49] <jParkton> shoky: shouldnt power(2,5) be 2^5?
[15:04:00] <jParkton> or is my math broken
[15:04:03] <shoky> jParkton: yup and it is
[15:04:22] <shoky> donno bout your math ;p
[15:04:39] <jParkton> lol
[15:04:45] <antlong_> ty sir, duch_kazatel
[15:04:52] <jParkton> power(1,9) === 2?
[15:04:56] <shoky> jParkton:  you don't mean 2^5  in javascript, right
[15:05:05] <jParkton> no in normal math
[15:05:15] <jParkton> 2**5 in py?
[15:05:23] <shoky> power(1,9) is 1
[15:05:42] <jParkton> yeah for some reason console says 2 lol
[15:05:52] <shoky> uh.. re-check that ;p
[15:06:00] <jParkton> lol
[15:06:09] <shoky> and if it's still not working, make a jsfiddle
[15:10:57] <jParkton> shoky: http://imgur.com/mJDwna8
[15:11:13] <jParkton> but that might just be some weird jsbin thing?
[15:13:20] <shoky> where's the jsfiddle?
[15:13:24] <shoky> or jsbin
[15:16:52] <duch_kazatel> dude's really protectivr.
[15:16:56] <duch_kazatel> *protective
[15:17:08] <shoky> lol
[15:17:49] <shoky> a-ha but the screenshot has the url!
[15:18:14] <duch_kazatel> victory!
[15:18:24] <shoky> oh
[15:18:29] <shoky> he';s using jsbin's console crap
[15:18:44] <duch_kazatel> ew
[15:18:51] <shoky> oh but that's working fine anyways
[15:19:30] <synti> duch_kazatel: iam doing right here http://jsfiddle.net/hz8ED/ ?
[15:20:06] <duch_kazatel> synti no.  read the docs for .html()
[16:07:44] <__joshua___> duch_kazatel: whats the problem with it?
[16:08:23] <__joshua___> well, you should declare options before you append to it, i guess
[16:08:35] <__joshua___> oh that was ages ago.  heh.
[16:10:35] <erming> anyone know a plugin that got really good documentation? i need some inspiration
[16:54:57] <jphase> erming: momentjs, jQuery UI, or jQuery itself might be a good start :)
[17:02:20] <erming> thanks jphase! i'll look them up

[18:56:17] <chrishough> anyone have thoughts on this SO post? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24175243/codeschool-jquery-return-flight-5-10-on-click-handler-failing
[18:58:33] <shoky> chrishough:  should probably be  .on('click', '.see-photos', function()...
[18:58:59] <shoky> chrishough: also they told you to do var tour = $(this)  so that you could use it INSIDE the click handler
[19:02:20] <chrishough> @shoky  when I change it to $.fn.photofy = function() {
[19:02:21] <chrishough>   this.each(function() {
[19:02:22] <chrishough>  		var tour = $(this)
[19:02:24] <chrishough>     tour.on('click', '.see-photos', function() {
[19:02:25] <chrishough>     	tour.addClass('is-showing-photofy');
[19:02:27] <chrishough>     });
[19:02:28] <chrishough>   });
[19:02:29] <shoky> don't paste here
[19:02:30] <chrishough> }
[19:02:31] <chrishough> $(document).ready(function() {
[19:02:33] <chrishough>   $('.tour').photofy();
[19:02:34] <chrishough> });
[19:02:34] <chrishough> it borks on “Make sure to set a namespace for your click event listener -- in this case use `photofy` as the namespace and `click` as the event”
[19:02:50] <shoky> chrishough: then do what they tell you
[19:02:52] <chrishough> true, let me setup a gist
[19:03:02] <shoky> 'click.photofy'
[19:06:00] <chrishough> @shoky its odd, I added that
[19:06:17] <chrishough> and now it’s asking for preventDefault() which it does not appear to accept
[19:06:38] <shoky> you need an event argument for the event handler function
[19:06:44] <shoky> to call .preventDefault() on
[19:07:25] <chrishough> lol, yep @shoky
[19:07:27] <chrishough> thanks :)
[19:07:32] <shoky> np
[20:11:34] <chrishough> one last jquery ? for the night, anyone have thoughts on : https://gist.github.com/chrishough/e4f879c90c7b997e9402
[20:12:47] <chrishough> such a long day
[20:13:32] <Rainb> How'd you unescape a string, (a css string)
[20:18:11] <shoky> chrishough: i don't understand the error message, but one thing that's wrong is that it should be .off('.photophy')
[20:19:02] <shoky> chrishough: also should be .trigger('show')
[20:21:19] <chrishough> @shoky where would you put the .trigger?
[20:21:37] <chrishough> the funny thing is, this is working in their example but that error message keeps popping up
[20:21:54] <shoky> chrishough: same place you have it
[20:23:33] <chrishough> @shoky I updated my gist
[20:23:38] <chrishough> take a peek, that is all I added
[20:23:52] <chrishough> that error message stil displays. the rest of the code is theirs
[20:26:47] <chrishough> @shoky it’s odd
[20:28:53] <shoky> chrishough: maybe they have a bug, i donno
[20:29:34] <chrishough> odd right
[20:29:42] <chrishough> I am not crazy
[20:29:42] <chrishough> loo
[20:31:28] <shoky> chrishough: which tutorial is this again?
[20:33:26] <Hyperking> any suggestion on converting an address into a geo code (lat , long ) ?
[20:33:56] <Hyperking> or perhaps a js map that plots markers based on address
[20:34:52] <shoky> like google maps?
[20:36:52] <Hyperking> yes
[20:37:15] <shoky> google maps, then.
[20:38:06] <Hyperking> cant use google maps...
[20:39:13] <shoky> then not google maps...
[20:39:32] <chrishough> @shoky jquery return flight level 5.13
[20:39:59] <shoky> chrishough: oh that's a paid one i see. lame ;p
[20:40:15] <chrishough> codeschool is solid
[20:40:29] <chrishough> my entire org uses it, we compete
[20:40:43] <shoky> don't like what that snippet in that tutorial shows, really ;p
[20:41:01] <chrishough> some of their courses are better than others
[20:41:06] <chrishough> I think this one is a bug
[20:41:11] <chrishough> *has a bug
[20:41:13] <shoky> not just the bug
[20:41:26] <shoky> their jquery code could be better
[20:41:42] <shoky> and not have mistakes like .trigger('show.photofy')
[20:42:36] <chrishough> ahhh
[21:20:59] <shoelessone> Anybody have any recommendations for a charting/graphing library that is 1) responsive and 2) mobile friendly (smallish)?
[22:12:53] <antlong_> i have an amazingly infuriating issue: http://i.imgur.com/pHaxNNi.png i need to drag and drop the icon to the bottom storage, instead of the top (top right, to bottom right), it looks like it works, but it doesn't persist because afaics the storage doesn't exist
[22:39:17] <disappearedng> Is there a better way to write this? "[data-slide='" + current + "']")
[22:55:12] <cauffe> Hey all, this is a general question. I've been working as a PHP dev for 3 years and now Python with an emphasis in Django for 2 years now. I've been trying to write a lot of Optical Character Recognition apps and some 3D rendering / game engines in C++ but I just I feel like i'm capping out where I can go without a real CS degree. However I'm 30 and turning 31 in August, should I consider getting one?
[23:07:03] <chrishough> your call @cauffe
[23:07:12] <chrishough> depends on your $ resources
[23:07:15] <chrishough> it woudl not hurt you
[23:07:20] <chrishough> *would
[23:24:12] <jphase> CS degrees really are about getting entry level positions these days. If you have several years of work experience and the skillset to fit the job description, don't waste your money imo
[23:24:57] <jphase> every big company I've been a part of doesn't care about the degree unless the work experience isn't there :\
[23:32:29] <Cork> disappearedng: well that line will loop over all elements in the page checking if they have the data-slide attribute with the specific value
[23:32:45] <Cork> disappearedng: for selecting your prob better of adding a class to those elements
[23:32:57] <disappearedng> I have
[23:33:10] <disappearedng> it's just I can't believe js is still so ghetto. It's 2014
[23:33:21] <disappearedng> Why don't someone just write string interpolation into native js?
[23:33:54] <Cork> disappearedng: string interpolation is often a bad thing
[23:34:12] <disappearedng> no it's not
[23:34:19] <disappearedng> _EVERY_ programming language has it
[23:34:21] <Cork> in many languages it is
[23:34:34] <Cork> cause it leaves you open for exploits if you don't know what your doing
[23:35:32] <disappearedng> yeah then write a safe one then
[23:35:46] <disappearedng> I don't think writing '' + '' all over is gonna prevent xxs
[23:35:48] <disappearedng> xss
[23:36:25] <Cork> disappearedng: a common pattern used is ['', '', ''].join('')
[23:37:10] <disappearedng> man that's pretty lengthy since you have so many additional ''
[23:37:14] <disappearedng> but yeah I can use that in my code
