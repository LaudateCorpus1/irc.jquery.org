[00:00:10] <aaairc> jquery or css? i don't know. i wanted to have an effect where an image rotated as an animation.
[00:00:37] <djQuery> ?rotate
[00:00:38] <bot-t> djQuery, rotate | jQuery Plugins - jImageRotate is jQueryPlugIn to simulate 3D-rotation of images. The PlugIn uses HTML5-Canvastechnologie. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/rotate
[00:01:18] <djQuery> aaairc: nothing in jquery or jquery ui will do rotate
[00:02:29] <aaairc> djQuery: ok thanks
[00:09:31] <B2011> <a href='...' onclick='f1();f2()'>..</a>==>after click, is there a way to update onclick='f1()' ==>I.E. TO REMOVE ONE FUNCTION
[00:10:14] <djQuery> B2011: see ?.unbind
[00:10:15] <bot-t> B2011, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[00:10:53] <djQuery> hopefully you can do unbind('click', 'f1');
[00:10:57] <B2011> unbind works, but it removes all function. what i try to do is to keep one function . and remove one func
[00:11:30] <B2011> i tried yesterday. it does not work with unbind('click','f1')
[00:12:12] <B2011> maybe i should tell you my situation, maybe you can help me to work around other way:
[00:14:24] <B2011> + my book directiory ==> when click on the + sign, + becomes - , and read file directory to load data in, next time click on +/- sign, show/hide the contents, but do not need to read file directory again.
[00:15:13] <B2011> so click on the + sign, originally there is 2 func, and then remove the read directory func.
[00:17:47] <ejo> or just add a class to the element to indicate it has been clicked at least once
[00:18:03] <ejo> then operate differently with an if statement depending on hasClass()
[00:18:46] <B2011> <b id='d20' onclick="showHide('d20');loadDir('mybook')">+</a> my book
[00:18:58] <B2011> ejo : u r clever !
[00:19:04] <B2011> sounds great idea :D
[00:19:24] <ejo> :)  i like it better than doing extra binds/unbinds
[00:19:30] <djQuery> B2011: or just dont use inline scripts
[00:19:55] <B2011> me too. unbinds is first choice, but it doesnot work. sad
[00:20:20] <B2011> let me try again ...
[00:20:32] <djQuery> ?.once
[00:20:33] <bot-t> djQuery, $(...).once(); | jQuery Plugins - Filters out all elements that had the same filter applied on them before. It can be used to ensure that a function is only applied once to an element. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once
[00:23:27] <B2011> bot-t: i m actually jquery kid who just started couple days again. can you show me how to add the once() code ?
[00:23:27] <bot-t> B2011, My reply is no.
[00:23:42] <B2011> ah. ok
[00:24:43] <djQuery> $('#myUl').delegte('.notchached', 'click', function(){ $(this).addClass('chached').removeClass('notchached'); /* do ajax loady stuff */  });
[00:25:00] <djQuery> then do that agin for .chached
[00:26:08] <djQuery> B2011: see ?jqf
[00:26:09] <bot-t> B2011, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[00:26:50] <B2011> well. fix this later as i can still be ok with the reading direction by click on + each time.
[00:27:01] <B2011> what about :
[00:27:32] <B2011> click on the <a href='#'>next</a> actually link to the pageDown button on keyboard ?
[00:28:23] <B2011> i m trying to display a.txt on a screen. and click on the "Next" button, will show the next page of txt file, same as the pageDown key
[00:28:26] <B2011> possible ?
[00:30:42] <B2011> also i m now testing with the addClass -- which is actually seems great idea :D
[00:33:10] <Doonce> http://pduclothing.com/cart the anchor.button and input.button are different sizes in both firefox and ie. different as in between each other and between each browser
[00:34:24] <djQuery> in chrone as well
[00:34:49] <Doonce> why?
[00:36:16] <Doonce> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/ is also off.. so i dont think its my specific css, although its off more in mine..
[00:40:01] <B2011> WOW !! addClass works -- so happy now :D
[00:40:20] <Thomas`-> if i want to do a $.post() but don't need a response what parametres should i use?
[00:41:05] <djQuery> Thomas`-: just dont give it a reposne function/
[00:41:16] <djQuery> or success rather
[00:41:27] <Doonce> anyway to fix my thing? ive tried editing the padding to px, but its so different in each browser..
[00:41:28] <Thomas`-> what about for dataType?
[00:42:05] <Thomas`-> djQuery, would you tell php to exit straight away after processing or send a header of some type
[00:42:34] <djQuery> Thomas`-: if php doesnt respond u will generate an error
[00:43:04] <Thomas`-> but i could just do header("Content-Type: application/json"); exit; ?
[00:43:33] <Thomas`-> of does it expect a content length
[00:44:06] <B2011> well. hasClass works for the Level-1 directories, not it does not work for any other sub-directories
[00:45:05] <B2011> is it possible: when click on a button, and run a function, and the function will update its caller's "onclick='...'" contents ?
[00:45:40] <B2011> like $('#img').attr('src','new-img.png') etc?
[00:46:32] <B2011> $('#id').attr('onclick','func1') not working at all
[00:46:56] <sam350> b2011
[00:47:00] <B2011> :D
[00:47:05] <sam350> for that I would rebind
[00:47:17] <sam350> so you have your original click event
[00:47:31] <sam350> $("#id").click(function(){ //code })
[00:47:44] <sam350> I would make an external counter var
[00:47:56] <sam350> if you are wanting to rebind solely based on clicks
[00:48:15] <sam350> and not some other variable
[00:48:20] <sam350> so when you have an external var
[00:48:34] <sam350> you can check if the var is odd
[00:48:36] <sam350> or even
[00:48:39] <sam350> and then increment it
[00:48:40] <sam350> or
[00:49:04] <sam350> you can check for a certain number
[00:49:31] <sam350> then do $(this).click(function(){  //new code })
[00:50:02] <B2011> ok let me try. looks complicated..
[00:50:12] <sam350> noo
[00:50:42] <sam350> just put var clickCounter = 0;  outside of the .click(function()..
[00:50:57] <sam350> in the body of the click, put the code you want as default
[00:51:51] <sam350> how many times/often do you want to change it
[00:52:28] <sam350> its not a common need because usually there is something else in the app/site that you will use
[00:52:41] <B2011> well... give up :D
[00:54:24] <sam350> hey
[00:54:28] <sam350> had another thought
[00:55:05] <sam350> you can just rebind and then $.stopPropagation()  in the original based on the event
[00:55:11] <sam350> I mean based on the counter
[00:55:21] <sam350> so you dont need to do it all in the original click event
[00:55:36] <sam350> just bind another click event
[00:55:40] <sam350> at that point they will both fire
[00:56:22] <sam350> but you need to add the code to the original click event which checks your counter var, and based on whatever your needs are (every 3rd click, on the 4th click, whatever) you will stopPropagation() or return false
[00:56:58] <sam350> whichever your need is- to do the original only,  or to do the others and not the original
[00:58:06] <B2011> if (!$('#id').hasClass('mm')){codes.... ; $('#id').addClass('mm');} works fine for Level-1 directories. not sure why not works for sub-dir, i m sure the id passed in correctly
[01:01:09] <B2011> sorry me problem add the line at wrong position. add Class works for any dir :D
[01:01:14] <B2011> thanks sam350
[01:02:25] <B2011> jquery is as great invent as USB!
[01:02:31] <B2011> so great :D
[01:03:55] <B2011> now i m making a new ebook reader, onclick "NextPage" link on a page, will be same as press "PageDown" key on the keyboard, possible ?
[01:05:23] <B2011> OR, give you a long string, how to find out the first and last char position of the string on a page ?
[01:05:54] <B2011> sure enough it will be different on font size, and even browsers
[01:06:01] <B2011> i guess not easy job ?
[01:07:47] <ejo> maybe use anchor links.
[01:08:45] <B2011> ejo: firstly html5 no more anchor
[01:08:58] <ejo> oh really? ok.
[01:09:19] <B2011> ejo: secondly, amount of chars will be different according to font sizes
[01:09:46] <B2011> ejo: thirdly , i m not going to edit lots of ebook contents to inserts anchors.
[01:10:12] <ejo> right.
[01:10:15] <B2011> yeah. i m going to learn html5 more.
[01:10:27] <B2011> as there are something very different
[01:10:50] <B2011> like once <br /> now ==> <br> again :D
[01:11:10] <B2011> html4 is really too old
[01:11:35] <B2011> <BR> => <br> =><br /> => <br/> => <br>
[01:11:49] <B2011> the history of BR :D
[01:14:26] <B2011> i can see why there is <hearder> <footer> necessary in html5
[01:14:32] <B2011> i can not see why ...
[01:14:58] <B2011> well does not bother me, as i do not have to use
[01:16:00] <B2011> well, give you a screen size of 600*480; and font size = 20px ; how to calculate the strpos of the text at the end of each page ?
[01:16:19] <m0dmd> good day everyone.
[01:16:34] <B2011> goodday mate m0dmd  :D
[01:17:14] <m0dmd> sup sup buddy :)
[01:19:04] <benstar> can someone help me out with a clash between bxslider and jdgallery for WP
[01:19:38] <Lomex> I want to do some sort of ajax endless scrolling. Can anyone tell me how I can just load as much content as fits on the current screen size? :P Just the basics no full guide needed
[01:20:40] <sam350> lomex
[01:20:46] <sam350> easier than youd think
[01:20:50] <Lomex> really? :D
[01:20:53] <sam350> yep
[01:21:07] <Lomex> Can you give me some tips
[01:21:10] <sam350> first, dump a bunch of the data to the screen
[01:21:23] <benstar> does anyone have any clue as to why these two scripts are conflicting, it shuold be pretty simple but im a noob at jquery
[01:21:24] <benstar> http://pastebin.com/4zEhdwhG
[01:21:32] <Sora_> overflow-y: scroll? xD
[01:21:34] <sam350> next, calculate the width and hight of each individual LI
[01:21:43] <sam350> or whatever you are putting the individual items in
[01:22:05] <sam350> actually get the number of items that fit on a screen
[01:22:15] <sam350> this will depend on what else you plan to have in your layout
[01:22:52] <sam350> oh so with the variable screen size, we are basing how many items to get at once on the size of each item
[01:22:59] <sam350> so when you do your fetch
[01:23:51] <sam350> you will check $('body').height() and calculate how many items would fit
[01:24:20] <paveloosha> @sam350, is it not so complicated?
[01:24:22] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[01:24:32] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm having trouble animationg a a background image's position
[01:24:43] <sam350> document.body.clientHeight
[01:25:06] <sam350> that is the viewable screen about.  $('body').height() is the total including offscreen
[01:25:16] <benstar> does anybody have any clue on how to edit this http://whamblog.net/wp-content/plugins/featured-content-gallery/scripts/mootools.v1.11.js
[01:25:29] <benstar> its conflicting with bxslider
[01:25:30] <sam350> so you will divide document.body.clientHeight by the height of an item
[01:25:41] <sam350> that will tell you how many rows to get
[01:26:21] <sam350> to get the number of items, you will calculate the number of rows (document.body.clientHeight/itemHeight) * (document.body.clientWidth/itemWidth)
[01:26:41] <sam350> which is what that equasion tells you
[01:27:39] <sam350> the itemHeight and itemWidth could be typed in manually in the code, because you will know that already by testing with your data
[01:27:57] <sam350> you will also want to set fixed height to the <li> in css
[01:28:16] <sam350> that way we can guarantee we are fetching 1 page worth at a time
[01:30:14] <sam350> since this is a jquery channel, better use $('body')[0].clientHeight instead of document.body.clientHeight
[01:30:16] <sam350> hehe
[01:32:11] <B2011> well. i have a plan: is there a jquery feature, to count how many times that you pressed key of "PageDown" ?
[01:37:37] <B2011> how to change this line to jquery:
[01:37:39] <B2011> 	display = document.getElementById('t'+id).style.display;
[01:38:24] <B2011> $('#t'+id).style.display ?
[01:42:17] <_41Ph4_> hi, how can i force/delay an ajax call? (async:false doesn't work 'cause it's a delayed call)
[01:43:14] <_41Ph4_> i mean, there is a delayed JS call in the page i'm calling with ajax method
[01:43:55] <sam350> when you start the $.ajax({..... you need to save a reference to it
[01:44:12] <sam350> create a global var myAjax outside of any function that creates the $.ajax
[01:44:24] <sam350> and then do myAjax = $.ajax({....
[01:44:35] <sam350> then you can control the ajax request with the myAjax var
[01:45:34] <_41Ph4_> u mean like this?: var myAjax; myAjax=$.ajax({...})
[01:47:48] <_41Ph4_> and then?; myAjax.delay()?
[01:54:40] <sam350> theres a ton of stuff you can do with an ajax object reference- look at jquery's docs
[01:55:44] <sam350> if you just want to delay when the $.ajax({... is executed, just put a setTimeout(function(){ $.ajax({.... }, 3000)
[01:56:01] <sam350> where 3000 is the milisecond delay of course
[02:01:29] <benni> can someone tell me the proper syntax for this: http://pastebin.com/amCUzzmv
[02:01:42] <benni> im just trying to add noconflict to that function
[02:01:52] <benni> but i know thats the wrong way to write it
[02:21:09] <clockwize> hey guys, i have a div with some other divs inside it, how would i get the height of the tallest div?
[02:26:48] <Lomex> hey I have some sort of blog and just want to print as many <article> as fit on the current screen of the user, can anyone help me with this?
[02:27:06] <Lomex> Should I just print them one by one until the scrollbar shows up or something like this
[02:40:06] <Santhosh> Hi I am using JQGrid where I use inheritance but if I have space in the string the inheritance is not working anyone have the solution
[02:43:39] <paveloosha> @Lomex, I think  logically your requirment is not correct.. suppose you have 5 blog posts and 3 & half of 4th of them is taking full screen.. then what should happen!!
[02:44:52] <paveloosha> @Lomex, I mean 3 of them are not filling whole screen, half of number 4 is needed to fill the screen..
[02:45:33] <Lomex> paveloosha: It's fine if its a little more
[02:45:52] <Lomex> paveloosha: I just dont want to have like 200 posts on my site. I want to do ajax content loading on scrolling
[02:46:08] <paveloosha> Lomex, then scroll will come..
[02:46:41] <Lomex> I want to load content on scrolling
[02:46:47] <Lomex> So I need the scroll anyway right?
[02:47:00] <Lomex> To let people know that theres more content to scroll for
[02:47:27] <paveloosha> I understand..
[02:47:34] <Lomex> Like on twitter
[02:47:55] <paveloosha> where do want to add the listener? on scroll?
[02:48:18] <Lomex> I've no idea yet hehe
[02:48:37] <Lomex> I think theres a way to check how much more to scroll right?
[02:48:53] <Lomex> so if for example the scrollbar is about to hit the end, I want to trigger next load
[02:51:31] <paveloosha> then calculate height of that div which is cointaining posts.. when $(document).scrollTop() is exciding height of that div, appen next post..
[02:52:43] <paveloosha> Lomex, *Exceed
[02:53:12] <Lomex> Oh
[02:53:27] <paveloosha> is the logic clear for you?
[02:53:28] <Lomex> Is there no way to get the distance from the bottom?
[02:53:29] <Lomex> yes
[02:53:51] <paveloosha> whose distance?
[02:55:09] <Lomex> Well right now, you say I should check the distance of the scrollbar from the top
[02:55:32] <paveloosha> yes
[02:55:53] <Lomex> I ask, if there is a way to check distance from bottom
[02:55:59] <Lomex> Like scrollBottom() or something :D
[02:57:28] <Lomex> if ($(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() - $(window).height()){
[02:57:39] <paveloosha> check this http://yelotofu.com/2008/10/jquery-how-to-tell-if-youre-scroll-to-bottom/
[02:58:31] <Lomex> thanks
[02:59:21] <paveloosha> np
[03:02:19] <yacek19> hi
[03:03:36] <paveloosha> hello
[03:04:14] <yacek19> I am inside form and I would like to submit this form. How can I do it without using id selector like $('#myform').submit() ?
[03:06:24] <paveloosha> @yacek19, <form name="input" action="yourServersidefile.php" method="get">
[03:06:57] <paveloosha> you can use method="post" too..
[03:07:26] <ningia> yacek19: $("form[name=myformname]").submit ()
[03:07:46] <yacek19> ningia: I found  $(this).parents('form:first').submit();
[03:08:13] <Kit-10> this.form.submit()
[03:08:29] <Kit-10> get back to basics :)
[03:08:49] <ningia> asd
[03:09:35] <paveloosha> :)
[03:17:50] <saschagehlich> hey there - I'm doing a lot of jquery animations in my current project. My problem is, when my tab in chrome / firefox / whatever is not visible and i switch back to it later, it does all the animations that would've been done while the tab was invisible
[03:17:56] <saschagehlich> Is there a way to avoid that?
[03:20:04] <paveloosha> @<saschagehlich>, not clear..
[03:20:16] <saschagehlich> not clear what i mean?
[03:20:38] <paveloosha> yes
[03:20:54] <saschagehlich> hmm so... an example
[03:21:07] <saschagehlich> I have an animation that goes for 10 seconds... e.g. moving a div from left to right
[03:21:29] <paveloosha> ok
[03:21:32] <paveloosha> then?
[03:21:36] <saschagehlich> if I switch to another browser tab and wait 10 seconds... and switch back to my project tab
[03:21:41] <saschagehlich> I expect the div to be on the right - right?
[03:21:54] <paveloosha> yes
[03:22:05] <saschagehlich> but what it does is, it stops the animation while I'm in another tab
[03:22:16] <saschagehlich> and when I switch back, the animation is still running / continuing
[03:22:26] <paveloosha> ohh God !!
[03:22:58] <saschagehlich> that was just a simple example
[03:23:08] <paveloosha> it is definitly a Jghost ... joking..
[03:23:20] <saschagehlich> what I'm actually doing is I'm playing a track and according to the music I'm doing animations
[03:23:39] <saschagehlich> if I switch to another tab the music still plays but the animation stops... if I switch back, the animation is out of sync (since the music played along)
[03:23:52] <paveloosha> okay.. can you show me your code?
[03:23:58] <saschagehlich> yeah one moment
[03:25:40] <saschagehlich> https://gist.github.com/5c2e22ff13f42bb4d01e (that's crappy code since I'm only doing concept stuff... final code will look better i hope :P)
[03:26:15] <moro> Hi
[03:26:28] <moro> Someone here who can help me with my problem?
[03:26:54] <saschagehlich> moro: if you tell us which problem - maybe.
[03:27:04] <moro> Sure
[03:27:08] <moro> may I pm you?
[03:27:15] <saschagehlich> just post it here
[03:27:16] <moro> Then we can speak german. :D
[03:27:19] <moro> oke
[03:27:20] <saschagehlich> people will help you
[03:28:30] <moro> http://morosystems.de/neueseite/ In the Box on the left top, if you click on Login the Login box hides and on the uper left box appears a Cancel link, I want if I click on Cancel that Cancel hides and the Login box is shown again.
[03:28:37] <moro> But it doesn't work.
[03:30:14] <saschagehlich> at first: ids should be unique
[03:31:50] <moro> Ah
[03:31:53] <moro> Works now
[03:32:02] <saschagehlich> what did you do?
[03:32:06] <paveloosha>  @<saschagehlich>, I have seen your code.. it may be happening due to "setTimeout"
[03:32:26] <andraskende> Im checking an text input for change .keyup is good but fires too many times... is there a way to only fire if if the text is changed ?  something like .change
[03:32:38] <moro> I made one link
[03:32:43] <moro> with id="LoginLink"
[03:33:10] <saschagehlich> andraskende: http://api.jquery.com/change/ - but afaik it only fires if you change the input and make it lose its focus
[03:34:21] <andraskende> saschagehlich: yes thats what happens... basically i dont want to fire on cursor movement but on if the text is changed...
[03:34:52] <saschagehlich> andraskende: what I usually do is creating an interval that checks whether the text has changed like... every 200ms
[03:35:03] <saschagehlich> or every 1000ms depending on what you're actually trying to do
[03:36:07] <saschagehlich> andraskende: maybe you should have a look at .keypress()
[03:36:16] <skylamer`> yea or key down :)
[03:36:21] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: any suggestions for a workaround?
[03:36:43] <saschagehlich> skylamer`: I just read that key down only gets fired once if a user holds down a key... keypress() would be better i guess
[03:37:11] <paveloosha> testing.........
[03:37:45] <andraskende> saschagehlich: thanks, will look into it... im hitting my jquery limits :)
[03:38:43] <andraskende> its a jax whois search want to check only once :)  also need to implement some caching too..
[03:39:39] <saschagehlich> well for ajax requests / live searches I usually do that interval thing... to avoid massive requests if a user holds down a key
[03:39:59] <saschagehlich> so that the browser only does a ajax request every second and not every time the user hits a key
[03:42:44] <andraskende> saschagehlich: thanks again...
[03:47:05] <paveloosha> @<saschagehlich>, I just checked it in my PC .. but it is working!!
[03:47:13] <saschagehlich> woot?
[03:47:21] <saschagehlich> which os and which browser?
[03:48:23] <paveloosha> XP , FF
[03:48:47] <saschagehlich> hmm let my try this in ff
[03:51:02] * Chib am bored
[03:51:04] <Chib> who's got a question!
[03:52:08] <paveloosha> @<saschagehlich>, I think you should use setInterval
[03:52:16] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: okay, works for FF - did you try it with chrome?
[03:53:26] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: same thing with setInterval in chrome
[03:55:37] <joon> hi, someone who ever use elrte in a jquery ui dialog ?
[04:00:19] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381?cversion=0&cnum_hist=16
[04:01:05] <juha___> why isn't my console in chrome showing any errors or console.log stuff :''/
[04:03:18] <paveloosha> <saschagehlich>, hmmm..
[04:07:35] <paveloosha> So..!!
[04:12:27] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: so? I think the topic I sent you does not explain my problem - but that's actually another problem I had :)
[04:13:54] <paveloosha> I understand your problem - but it is a global problem :)
[04:16:29] <paveloosha> @saschagehlich, is your problem solved?
[04:16:37] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: nope
[04:16:45] <saschagehlich> .delay() results in the same problem
[04:17:16] <paveloosha> they are saying this problem was not in version 1.5
[04:20:13] <saschagehlich> paveloosha: hooray, works with 1.5
[04:20:13] <paveloosha> @saschagehlich, Please use version 1.5.2 and check.. dont forget to let me know it is working or not..
[04:20:19] <saschagehlich> http://jsfiddle.net/sgehlich/PSAWG/1/
[04:20:33] <paveloosha> grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat...
[04:21:40] <saschagehlich> thanks a lot paveloosha
[04:21:44] <paveloosha> so it is a bug between 1.5.2 to 1.6
[04:22:38] <paveloosha> Thanks to you.. you just opend a problem which was unknown by me..:)
[04:24:01] <saschagehlich> :)
[04:31:06] <aaairc> anyone have a recommendation on a google maps plugin? there seem to be a couple different ones out there.
[04:31:20] <aaairc> ... to embed google maps into your site
[04:31:27] <joon> gmpa is very easy to use
[04:31:30] <joon> gmap
[04:33:55] <aaairc> joon: cool thanks. i'll check it out. does it make it easy to pass two street addresses so on load it shows directions?
[04:34:58] <joon> hum never tried this
[04:34:59] <aaairc> no street by street... but just a highlighting on the map the streets you would have to take driving... and perhaps how long it would take & the distance needed to travel?
[04:35:06] <aaairc> joon: ok
[04:36:19] <joon> aaairc it seems that u need a modul to do this : Openlayer
[04:37:09] <aaairc> ok will read about OpenLayer.
[04:37:24] <aaairc> what is a module?
[04:38:05] <joon> maybe it s a plugin for gmpa but i m not sure, seems to be a library
[04:39:39] <joon> anyone who use elrte in a jquery ui dialog box ?
[05:51:33] <texinwien> I'm playing around with SVG and javascript/jQuery to make a sort of simplified drafting program.
[05:52:15] <texinwien> Trying to figure out a good object model to represent different geometric entities.
[05:52:45] <texinwien> Anyone have any experience in that area, or interested in chatting about it?
[06:24:41] <Lomex> Can anyone help me. I have a trigger on scroll on -> http://wogibiz.dyndns.org/ to load new entrys with ajax. It works fine in chrome but on firefox the scrollling wont trigger
[06:35:55] <Lomex> I want to check if the scrollbar is at the end of the page
[06:35:55] <Lomex>  if ($(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() - $(window).height() )
[06:35:57] <Lomex> Doing this
[06:36:00] <Lomex> Works fine in Chrome but not in firefox
[06:36:03] <Lomex> Anyone can help?
[06:37:37] <dabear> Lomex: probably because of rounding errors
[06:37:56] <Lomex> dabear: Any idea how I can fix this?
[06:38:26] <Lomex> It would be fine if it even triggers when it gets near end of the page
[06:39:22] <dabear> in firefox 3.6 I seem to get high values even at the end of page
[06:39:23] <dabear> 10604
[06:40:58] <Lomex> How can i quickly dump a variable/function?
[06:41:03] <Lomex> console.log() or something?
[06:49:14] <nikhgupta> hey everyone.. I want to increase the width of an element on hover, but in a smooth transistion (animation)
[06:49:30] <nikhgupta> I have the following code, I am using (this does not do animation, however)
[06:49:37] <nikhgupta> $('.highlight').hover(
[06:49:38] <nikhgupta>         function() {
[06:49:38] <nikhgupta>             $(this).css('width', $('#wrapper').css('width'));
[06:49:38] <nikhgupta>         },
[06:49:38] <nikhgupta>         function() {
[06:49:40] <nikhgupta>             $(this).css('width', '100%');
[06:49:42] <nikhgupta>         }
[06:49:44] <nikhgupta>     );
[06:49:55] <nikhgupta> can someone please suggest me what next needs to be done??
[06:51:37] <Phil> is it possible to get the currently used font from an element?
[06:51:59] <Phil> this is specifically for if there's a number of font options
[06:54:33] <dnlmzw> nikhgupta: You have to use the .animation() .. .css just sets the value. without any animation
[06:54:53] <dnlmzw> phil: have you tried .css('font-family') ?
[06:57:49] <Phil> dnlmzw, yes
[06:58:00] <Phil> in some browsers it returns the current font and in others just a list of the fonts
[06:58:14] <Lomex> if  ($(window).scrollTop() > $(document).height() - $(window).height() -50 ){
[06:58:17] <Lomex> I do something like this on scroll event
[06:58:30] <Lomex> But when the condition is triggered the function i call is hammered wiht alot of requests
[06:58:35] <Lomex> Can i do something like wait()
[06:59:00] <dnlmzw> What about splitting the string you get?
[06:59:38] <dnlmzw> string($("#id").css('font-family')).split(',');
[06:59:48] <nikhgupta> I get this error: missing : after property id
[06:59:49] <nikhgupta> [Break On This Error] $(this).css('width', $('#wrapper').css('width'));
[07:00:31] <Phil> Lomex, you can use a timer which resets itself before re-running
[07:00:56] <Phil> so you'd trigger the function e.g. 100ms after scrolling stops
[07:01:11] <dnlmzw> nikhgupta: Are you still trying to get the width to animate?
[07:01:27] <Phil> dnlmzw, that wouldn't work as the list is always complete
[07:01:27] <kapil> hi
[07:01:31] <nikhgupta> dnlmzw, yeah actually... I added the .animate() method and using the above code inside it.
[07:01:33] <Phil> I want the currently in use font
[07:01:59] <Phil> I'm trying to detect if the browser hasn't rendered an @font-face font and has rather fallen back to Arial
[07:02:06] <Phil> in which case, I need to change the font size and letter spacing
[07:02:56] <nikhgupta> dnlmzw, seems like I m having some scoping issues
[07:04:00] <dnlmzw> phil: hmm. ok! i just found this. for any use? http://paulirish.com/2009/font-face-feature-detection/
[07:04:56] <dnlmzw> nikhgupta: you cant just put the css inside. you have to do it like: $('tag').animate({widht: '100px'}, 1000); - think its something like that.
[07:05:17] <nikhgupta> dnlmzw, oh thank you.. I was trying to access it with $(this).css()
[07:05:21] <nikhgupta> that should help :)
[07:06:08] <dnlmzw> nikhgupta: theres an error in my code 'width' but try to look it up here if you have any problems: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:06:56] <Phil> dnlmzw, that looks good
[07:06:57] <Phil> I'll try it
[07:07:08] <nikhgupta> thank you, this works :)
[07:08:23] <nikhgupta> dnlmzw, just one more thing..
[07:08:47] <nikhgupta> its getting the animation more than once.. like whenever the hover is being done on it (even 10 times in less than a second)
[07:08:53] <nikhgupta> and then it animates 10 times
[07:09:00] <nikhgupta> is there a way to avoid that?
[07:13:09] <kborchers> nikhgupta: I missed the beginning of your question. Are you using .animate() or some plugin?
[07:13:29] <nikhgupta> kborchers, I am simply using .animate()
[07:14:27] <kborchers> And the issue is just that the animations chain if they are fired a bunch of times in a row?
[07:16:10] <Lomex> Phil: I don't it with a boolean now which is resetted on ajax success works fine. Do you have an ideal how I can check if the page is scrollable or not?
[07:16:30] <nikhgupta> kborchers, yeah exactly
[07:16:31] <kborchers> nikhgupta: I would just set a var yo true before you start the animation. Then when it is complete, set the var back to false. Before running the animation check that var to make sure it isn't already running
[07:16:52] <nikhgupta> hmm nice.. thank you kborchers
[07:17:13] <Lomex> Ah I can just use scrollTOp
[07:19:00] <dnlmzw> you can use the .stop(true, false).animate()
[07:19:11] <dnlmzw> it stops the animation and removes the que.
[07:19:29] <dnlmzw> nikhgupta: ^
[07:19:42] <Lomex> I right now load content of my page as soon as the scrollbar is about to reach end. but how can I just load as much content on beginning to fit the screen? Any idea?
[07:24:51] <Phil> Lomex, .scrollHeight() iirc
[07:25:15] <Lomex> more details please
[07:25:20] <Phil> check if $(document).scrollHeight() > $(window).height()
[07:25:25] <Lomex> Alright
[07:31:43] <delinquentme> if i want to make a few divs draggable .. is there a core jquery operation i can use .. without implementing another library?
[07:37:42] <Lomex> Phil: I want to print as many div's to my page until the scrollbar comes up. the problem is, if I do it in a while() my page gets suck because the while is hammering my ajax function which takes a while to finished fetching data :(
[07:38:55] <Lomex> I need a jquery pro :D
[07:50:31] <Edler> hey guys
[07:50:46] <Edler> is it possible to load a js library at the end of the body
[07:51:04] <Edler> but put in the middle of the body something similar to document ready which executes a function once all script tags have loaded
[07:51:04] <Edler> ?
[07:54:49] <tolborg> Can any of you help me find nice resources for building prototypes using js? Like zurb which is a nice annotations library
[08:09:28] <delinquentme> derp! left before i heard any replies .. but yeah core functionality to make something dragable in jquery?
[08:09:38] <delinquentme> or do i really need to enable 3 libraries ?
[08:10:12] <VeXii> shod be in the ui pack
[08:11:39] <SMarek> hi, anybody using this plugin? http://orkans-tmp.22web.net/star_rating/
[08:25:23] <fabiobik> hi guys
[08:26:07] <VeXii> hello :)
[08:27:19] <fabiobik> i have a little problem with  ColorBox modal box. when i load the content the charaters are crasy.... how to solve charset problem?
[08:31:56] <fabiobik> http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/1282/issue.jpg
[08:33:54] <Whirl3d> I assign a class "alignLeft" or "alignRight" to a div to...you guessed it, align it to the left or right. Works great. However, if I animate the left property nothing happens. The right property works fine. Any ideas?
[08:34:14] <SMarek> fabiobik: content is fetched via ajax call?
[08:39:47] <fabiobik> SMarek i guess yes
[08:40:23] <SMarek> fabiobik: any info in chrome > console ?
[08:42:45] <Whirl3d> anybody know why I can't get a simple square in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/hDWSR/11/
[08:43:09] <SMarek> fabiobik: i think, you should be able to repair it via adding header to ajax-fetched content like: <?header('Content-type: text/html; charset=yourencoding');?>
[08:45:43] <SMarek> Whirl3d: don't know what you're trying to do, but naming is case-sensitive, so .biggerPanel != .biggerpanel
[08:47:52] <Whirl3d> SMarek, thanks, I typed that wrong and forgot my units in my css.
[08:48:10] <SMarek> Whirl3d: and 500 should be 500px
[08:48:35] <SMarek> Whirl3d: oh, probably what you just wrote :D
[08:49:04] <Whirl3d> SMarek, so I updated the fiddle to do what I want. and it seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/hDWSR/25/ but in my real files, it only works on the right
[08:49:07] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/hDWSR/25/
[08:50:08] <Whirl3d> if you replace the class on #fg from alignLeft to alignRight it behaves the way I want. In my actual files, it only works for the right side. The left side just sits there.
[08:50:21] <SMarek> Whirl3d: then show me your real file, if it's not working in combo with something else, we can't repair it like this
[08:50:42] <Whirl3d> it'll take a sec to post. brb. THanks for your help
[08:51:15] <SMarek> Whirl3d: and in .alignLeft you had left:0, text-align:… (note that , sign)
[08:55:57] <Lomex> I want to reset scrollbar to top after page is done loading (even on reload) $(document).scrollTop(0); is not working on every reload
[08:55:59] <Lomex> anyone has an idea why?
[08:56:05] <Whirl3d> SMarek, weird thing is that neither of them work once posted. Here's the file (please excuse the ugliness) :http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/test-alignRight.html
[08:56:16] <Whirl3d> or the same with alignLeft
[08:58:31] <SMarek> Whirl3d: and your problem is that "Your Case" is not fully visible or what?
[08:58:51] <Whirl3d> The wolves should animate in from the side.
[08:59:21] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/index.html#overview
[08:59:30] <SMarek> Whirl3d: but I got them animated on right
[09:00:27] <Whirl3d> locally, they animate on the right but not on the left. online, I don't get them animated (exceptfor opacity) on either side
[09:00:59] <SMarek> can't say, but online they got animated from right for me
[09:02:12] <Whirl3d> try the same file with one change: alignLeft:  http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/test-alignLeft.html
[09:02:55] <nezZario> does anybody know of a jquery plugin that can give me really decent looking spreadsheet-like tables?
[09:03:05] <nezZario> i don't mean <tables>
[09:03:32] <SMarek> Whirl3d: and they should come from most left to same position as on test-alignRight?
[09:04:04] <Whirl3d> They should come from off screen to on screen (aligned left) or (aligned right)
[09:04:17] <Whirl3d> but the animation breaks on the left, not on the right.
[09:04:39] <Whirl3d> however, if you view the left first, then the right...the right breaks  until you refresh. WTF?
[09:06:16] <SMarek> Whirl3d: sorry, but don't know how to help you, maybe somebody else will
[09:06:19] <Whirl3d> SMarek, thanks for your help--it's a bizarre thing. Don't spend too much time on it. I was hoping someone had a quick fix (like I forgot units in my fiddle)...
[09:06:21] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/NqBDyEpP
[09:06:34] <rethus> i have this to create a object, which have other objects include
[09:06:36] <Whirl3d> Thanks again.
[09:06:59] <rethus> if i try to do something like: userObj[asdf].chanGeneral 	= $.extend({},chanGeneral);
[09:07:29] <rethus> i got the message, that asdf cause in an error (asdf shoul be a string here.. .to use direct-access to the object
[09:07:40] <rethus> userObj.asdf.src
[09:07:53] <rethus> instead of userObj[0].src
[09:08:04] <SMarek> Whirl3d: sorry, haven't registered nothing like that
[09:08:38] <rethus> why this didn't work? Can i only add objects with int (userObj[1]) instead of a string [userObj[asdf]) ?
[09:09:39] <BinaryKitten> rethus just going to look over your pastebin
[09:10:09] <rethus> BinaryKitten: thank you
[09:13:14] <BinaryKitten> rethus can you update it please?  need to know where and how chanGeneral, chanPbx and chanCdr are set up/defined
[09:13:59] <nezZario> ugh
[09:14:06] <rethus> puh, its a realy big script. but i try to send the values of it, and a bit more context
[09:14:08] <nezZario> this is like trying to find a needle in a haystack
[09:14:13] <Whirl3d> SMarek, found the culprit. By adding text-align:right to the left and text-align:left to the right, it breaks on the left, not on the right.
[09:14:17] <nezZario> why can't you rate jQuery plugins?
[09:14:51] <nezZario> i would like to see "hey this one sucks and hasn't been updated in a year"
[09:15:06] <nezZario> "this one is updated semi frequently and 10 out of 13 people liked it"
[09:16:30] <rethus> BinaryKitten: http://pastebin.com/7tWdq4fY
[09:16:54] <rethus> i copy the data of the 3 objects out of webkit-console.
[09:17:50] <rethus> this 3 Objects will be concat to one object, and assign to userObj[0....n] for now
[09:18:18] <rethus> but i want to assign it to userObj.<chanCdrVar.src>
[09:18:26] <rethus> i hope you know what i mean
[09:22:37] <BinaryKitten> rethus which version of jquery are you usingg?
[09:22:55] <rethus> 1.5.2
[09:24:43] <BinaryKitten> ok
[09:25:14] <rethus> maybe its the solution to add a dynamic-string to this line:
[09:25:15] <rethus> userObj{here dynamicString for chanGeneral.src}.chanGeneral 	= $.extend({},chanGeneral);
[09:25:39] <BinaryKitten> the main issue is that you are changing the object from within a .each
[09:26:13] <BinaryKitten> not the easiest way
[09:26:39] <rethus> yea, thats cause there can be many objects encapsulate in this main-object.
[09:27:20] <BinaryKitten> rethus though about .map?
[09:27:26] <BinaryKitten> ?.map
[09:27:28] <rethus> problem with the actual solution is, i have to walt each object[i] to find the right chanCdrVar.src
[09:27:41] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:27:47] <rethus> i didn't know map. What the difference? Did you have an example
[09:28:09] <BinaryKitten> yep  .map changes the value to whatever is returned from the function
[09:28:40] <rethus> you mean i have to use .map instead of extend()?
[09:28:51] <BinaryKitten> instead of the .each
[09:29:47] <rethus> can i only change it to map, or have i to change something else in my loop?
[09:29:48] <BinaryKitten> create a new object.. based upon what you want and return it
[09:30:06] <BinaryKitten> that will then become the item at that inde in the array
[09:32:41] <rethus> have to gone for 30 minutes. than i try what you say
[09:56:17] <Indeede> hello, is there a way I can pass additional parameters into the ajax success function?
[09:56:52] <Jayflux> Indeede such as?
[09:58:02] <Indeede> I have it running in a for loop to load a few pages, and I also want to be able to know which page I am toying with in the success call, so I dont crowd the original source code with extra divs and ids
[09:58:20] <Indeede> so basically the url
[09:58:23] <Indeede> i loaded
[09:59:39] <VeXii> save the url in a var before the call
[09:59:52] <VeXii> and it gets scopped down to you
[10:00:59] <Indeede> within the for loop?
[10:01:34] <illyCoffee84> hello there!
[10:03:28] <Indeede> wouldn't it get overwritten in the next iteration?
[10:05:25] <Jayflux> Indeede you may need a switch case inside your for
[10:07:43] <Indeede> hmm
[10:07:46] <ravenzz> Indeede you could create an array or an object that will collect all the info you need
[10:11:52] <illyCoffee84> can anybody explain me why the delegate method is not working for me with this code?
[10:11:55] <illyCoffee84> http://jsfiddle.net/y9gja/
[10:11:55] <Indeede> how would i call it though?
[10:15:47] <Jayflux> illyCoffee84 you don't need to include jquery in jsfiddle
[10:16:10] <illyCoffee84> ok
[10:16:36] <illyCoffee84> Jayflux: do you know why the delegate method is not working in there?
[10:16:53] <illyCoffee84> if i put the same code inside the body tag, works just fine
[10:17:14] <Jayflux> seems fine to me
[10:17:33] <Jayflux> illyCoffee84 http://jsfiddle.net/y9gja/1/
[10:17:35] <Jayflux> its working is it now?
[10:17:36] <Jayflux> not
[10:19:02] <illyCoffee84> aha
[10:20:05] <illyCoffee84> http://jsfiddle.net/y9gja/3/
[10:20:09] <illyCoffee84> now it's working
[10:20:17] <illyCoffee84> but the thing is
[10:20:21] <kurisu> hi guys, is there a replaceInner function... I've searched but have not come up with anything useful.... any ideas?
[10:21:03] <illyCoffee84> if i put that script inside the head tag, it doesn't work
[10:21:10] <illyCoffee84> if I put it inside the body it works
[10:21:46] <Jayflux> illyCoffee84 you need to include it after jquery is included
[10:22:08] <Indeede> innerHTML?
[10:22:11] <illyCoffee84> yes
[10:22:27] <illyCoffee84> it's not working
[10:23:30] <rethus> BinaryKitten: I'm back
[10:24:12] <kurisu> Indeede: ahhhh thanks... im presuming $("somediv").innerHtml.replaceWith($new_inner_html); would work?
[10:24:44] <Indeede> I thought you were talking about the js innerHTML
[10:24:53] <Indeede> you could use .html()
[10:29:49] <m0dmd> hey everyone!
[10:31:30] <Indeede> hello
[10:31:44] <kurisu> Indeede: so I could just do $("#somedivid").html($newHTML); ??
[10:32:10] <Brodingo> ?html
[10:32:11] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[10:32:30] <kurisu> oh so I can't use it to replace html
[10:33:20] <BinaryKitten> ?.html()
[10:33:20] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[10:33:30] <BinaryKitten> you pass that
[10:33:36] <BinaryKitten> .html(newhtml)
[10:33:41] <BinaryKitten> it's a double function
[10:34:04] <Brodingo> DOUBLE FUNCTION
[10:34:13] <Brodingo> it leads a double life
[10:34:27] <Brodingo> getter AND setter
[10:34:28] <BinaryKitten> one way it gets and another way it sets
[10:34:29] <Indeede> so use replaceWith
[10:34:31] <Brodingo> must be hard
[10:35:19] <Indeede> lets make it a triple function
[10:35:23] <Indeede> INCEPTION
[10:35:28] <kurisu> $("#somedivid").html().relaceWith($newHTML); ??
[10:35:55] <Brodingo> wut
[10:35:55] <Indeede> $('#somedivid').replaceWith($newHTML.html());
[10:36:00] <Indeede> I think
[10:36:08] <kurisu> ah right
[10:36:19] <kurisu> new to jQ...
[10:36:37] <kurisu> thanks
[10:37:03] <K1ng> Indeede, wth?
[10:37:11] <Indeede> i'm wrong?
[10:37:17] <Indeede> i said I wasnt sure
[10:37:19] <K1ng> what you want to do?
[10:37:54] <K1ng> well .html(blah) is better
[10:38:10] <Indeede> oh
[10:38:18] <Brodingo> replaceWith replaces the actual elements it matches
[10:38:21] <Brodingo> html is for the innerHTML
[10:38:26] <Indeede> whooops
[10:39:40] <kurisu> ok so basically I have a list of imgs ".thumb" that when click I get some AJAX data and want to put it inside of "#somediv"
[10:39:57] <Brodingo> ?load
[10:39:57] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:40:02] <BinaryKitten> kurisu define ajax data
[10:40:04] <Brodingo> ?load(url)
[10:40:04] <bot-t> .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:40:15] <TrueColors> $('#header > div[id!="bannerToggle"]').hide();
[10:40:27] <TrueColors> how can i change that so id's not bannerToggle or bannerLogo ?
[10:40:28] <kurisu> wp ajax data
[10:40:36] <TrueColors> or by using something like this:  $("your-pure-css-selector").not('[name="value"]'
[10:40:38] <TrueColors> which i've just found.
[10:40:47] <TrueColors> is there an OR command?
[10:40:53] <TrueColors> well
[10:40:55] <TrueColors> AND, not or
[10:40:57] <TrueColors> is that i want
[10:41:20] <Brodingo> ||
[10:41:21] <TrueColors>  $("your-pure-css-selector").not('[name="value"]').not('[name="value"]') ...
[10:41:22] <TrueColors> oh
[10:41:32] <BinaryKitten> TrueColors $('#header div').not('#bannerToggle, #bannerLogo')
[10:42:13] <TrueColors> I'll try that BinaryKitten
[10:42:26] <rethus> BinaryKitten: in which way i can use the value of a var as name for a new var?
[10:42:36] <rethus> in php it is with $$var
[10:42:39] <TrueColors> ok...
[10:42:40] <TrueColors> it broke
[10:42:50] <rethus> is there are any way in js?
[10:42:55] <BinaryKitten> urm why would you need to?
[10:43:07] <kurisu> I have the ajax working fine and just had it replacing $('#someDiv') with the new $(#someDiv) using replace with.... but i want to change it so that it puts it inside $('#somediv')
[10:43:21] <BinaryKitten> kurisu use load
[10:43:23] <TrueColors> $('#header > div[id!="bannerToggle"]').hide(); works but only when it's not bannerToggle, but doing... $('#header div >').not('#bannerToggle, #bannerLogo').hide(); results in a unrecognised expression >
[10:43:29] <TrueColors> oh
[10:43:30] <TrueColors> > div
[10:43:32] <hsbot>   No instance for (GHC.Show.Show (a0 -> a0 -> a0)) arising from a use of `M9183474397021758122.show_M9183474397021758122' Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (GHC.Show.Show (a0 -> a0 -> a0))
[10:43:37] <rethus> chanGeneral.src have the value for my object, i create in map
[10:43:45] <kurisu> ?load
[10:43:46] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:44:04] <TrueColors> great, that works. cheers BinaryKitten
[10:44:20] <BinaryKitten> TrueColors np
[10:44:47] <necromancer> rethus: it is not possible to do that without eval, and you really don't want to use eval
[10:47:19] <rethus> so i cant set the object-key to a value, i've have inside of a var?
[10:49:45] <rethus> BinaryKitten: so map is not a solution... :(
[10:50:26] <rethus> http://de3.php.net/variables.variable
[10:50:40] <rethus> this in js would solve my problem
[10:52:42] <BinaryKitten> rethus i really hav no clue to what you're trying to achieve
[10:53:17] <BinaryKitten> rethus if that is your "problem" then you're thinking about it the wrong way
[11:03:46] <rethus> like you see before in my pastebin, i have some data-Objects... the data off the objects are extracted by a big text (return value of server-process).
[11:05:38] <spaceonline> ok
[11:07:08] <g0bl1n> what's the correct way to verify if a jQuery() returns an empty object ?
[11:08:27] <g0bl1n> var element = $('#thisWontExist');
[11:08:52] <rethus> BinaryKitten: So i try to explain it via pastebin...
[11:09:01] <rethus> this is the return-value of the server-process:
[11:09:03] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/vVLiEUSn
[11:09:16] <g0bl1n> jQuery.isEmptyObject()
[11:09:19] <rethus> so i have created this function to put all this values into my js-objects:
[11:09:53] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/Jiri6NxW
[11:11:07] <rethus> Target: I wan't to create an Object, which has other objects inside... this other objects didn't should named by id... they should be named by the value, which are parsed into my chanCdrVar.src
[11:13:16] <rethus> the value of "src" is given by the server-process and is not known before...
[11:13:49] <BinaryKitten> ok you're fetching json or xml?
[11:14:28] <rethus> src is the phonenumber of a caller to my teleophone-server. And the object should be accessable by this number (or name)... like userObj.myName.number
[11:14:48] <rethus> its only plain-text
[11:15:01] <BinaryKitten> then how are you parsing it?
[11:15:12] <rethus> the whole command is xml... but the value i postet in first pastebin... is the valeue off one xml-tag...
[11:15:24] <rethus> i'll show you
[11:16:17] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/4trfFDxg
[11:16:31] <rethus> response is a xml-tag
[11:16:35] <rethus> follows is the value
[11:16:44] <rethus> privvilege: is a xml-tag
[11:16:54] <rethus> "command" is the value ... and so on
[11:17:14] <BinaryKitten> that pastebin isn't xml
[11:17:25] <rethus> so, cliresponse is the xml-tag, and the whole --General -- String which follow is only the value of this tag.
[11:17:42] <rethus> therefore i've to create such big parsing.
[11:17:55] <rethus> i know, its the output of my console-debugger.
[11:17:56] <g0bl1n> jQuery.isEmptyObject() returns false if $("#notExistTest") is [] ?
[11:18:01] <BinaryKitten> you said it was xml rethus?
[11:18:15] <BinaryKitten> g0bl1n  [] != {}
[11:18:21] <rethus> in xml you have tags and values...
[11:18:22] <BinaryKitten> [] = empty array
[11:18:33] <BinaryKitten> rethus you have tags and content
[11:18:39] <BinaryKitten> but i don't see any tags
[11:18:41] <rethus> <cliresponse> --Generel--- <all the other stuff </cliresponse>
[11:18:43] <rethus> in this way
[11:18:45] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, so how can I verify if a jQuery() returns no elements ?
[11:18:48] <rethus> you know what i mean
[11:19:15] <rethus> would be great if this where be xml-parseable... than i wouldn't have this problem i've
[11:19:37] <BinaryKitten> g0bl1n var items = $(selector); if (items.length != 0) { // woot we found something }
[11:19:55] <BinaryKitten> rethus then do it on the PHP
[11:20:06] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, ok, I'll keep using length. I thought there was a method for that
[11:20:07] <BinaryKitten> parse the data on the php and send it to back in a usable state
[11:20:21] <rewt> if (items.length) {  // should be enough
[11:20:21] <rethus> i can't do it in php, cause its a websocket-application... all stuff is done in js
[11:20:33] <rethus> livve-event-tracking
[11:20:51] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, shouldn't jQuery.isEmptyOject() cover .length==0 ?
[11:20:57] <BinaryKitten> where are you getting the data from rethus?
[11:21:04] <BinaryKitten> g0bl1n no
[11:21:13] <BinaryKitten> ?.isEmptyObject
[11:21:13] <bot-t> jQuery.isEmptyObject(object): Check to see if an object is empty (contains no properties). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[11:21:25] <JKarsrud> g0bl1n: mind you, you can just go if(items.length)
[11:21:34] <JKarsrud> becase 0 is falsy in JS
[11:22:03] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, ok thanks. I thought of that because jQuery Object is a kind of "array"
[11:22:05] <BinaryKitten> g0bl1n jQuery.isEmptyObject takes an object
[11:22:20] <BinaryKitten> but the jquery object is not empty
[11:22:26] <BinaryKitten> it has properties like length
[11:22:27] <chris_st> Sortable (jQuery UI's sortable) question: I love the "Connect Lists" example, it's pretty much exactly what I want to do, but when one list is empty, you can't drop into it any more!  Is this known?  Is there a solution?
[11:22:39] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, haaaaaa nice one! ;-)
[11:24:35] <g0bl1n> BinaryKitten, creating locally a function for that :-) isNoContentObject()
[11:24:41] <chris_st> Hah, never mind, google found the solution... thanks anyway :-)
[11:41:25] <Whirl3d> Hey all. There's a ton of information about ways to use facebook/google to authenticate users on your site, but who can figure out which ones to use? Could someone with some experience in this matter point me to some information that could help? I'm asking for advice, the kind you can't get using Google, btw.
[11:41:50] <Whirl3d> Oh, and I'd like to use jquery in the process too if possible.
[11:46:57] <Lomex> Whirl3d: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/
[11:46:58] <Lomex> What about this?
[11:49:09] <rethus> BinaryKitten: where are you getting the data from rethus?
[11:49:15] <rethus> from asterisk-telephone server
[11:49:52] <BinaryKitten> directly?
[11:50:09] <rethus> yes
[11:50:27] <BinaryKitten> and it's just text?
[11:50:31] <rethus> yes
[11:50:50] <BinaryKitten> so you can't fetch that with php from your webserver
[11:51:23] <rethus> no, its directly parsed into javascript-browser-engine
[11:51:35] <rethus> means parsed by (not into)
[11:51:48] <BinaryKitten> i was suggesting changing that
[11:52:23] <Whirl3d> Lomex, thanks for the input. It's a little more than I was wanting to deal with. I was thinking a 3rd party service like AddThis or something...
[11:53:16] <rethus> the script woult also work this way it is now... but its not such clean... cause now i have to walk each object into my base-object and check for the value i need.... so if in my baseobject are 100 caller-objects, i have to walt each time the whole opjects to find out my caller "12345"
[11:54:11] <rethus> such like userObj[0].src="123" ... usrObj[1].src="123" and so on
[11:54:52] <rethus> i better want to check like if(userObj.user123)
[11:57:12] <BinaryKitten> I wish people would worry less about what is clean
[11:58:28] <rethus> so there only seems to be the way with eval :(
[11:59:00] <BinaryKitten> rethus probably because you are over thinking things and not seeing ways of doing it differently
[11:59:33] <BinaryKitten> afterall, there are loads of ways, just you're stuck on the one path you can't seem to get working
[11:59:47] <rethus> i didn't found another way. your welcome to show me one, if you know
[12:00:11] <BinaryKitten> i've suggested using map to create a replacement value.
[12:00:24] <BinaryKitten> i've suggested switching to using php to parse the data before sending it back
[12:01:03] <rethus> the name of the object should be given by my returnvalue from my server (not known before) so map is no solution...
[12:01:27] <rethus> php didn't work, cause its a fully js-socket-driven app
[12:01:36] <BinaryKitten> and?
[12:02:01] <rethus> so we not solvved my problem
[12:02:16] * BinaryKitten gives up
[12:02:32] <rethus> not me.. but thanks for your time and hints
[12:03:07] <rethus> only thing i could try is to fire an php-file over ajax
[12:04:13] <fr4nk> why you cant call ajax with php to your server to get the data? i dont understand the problem with js-socket-..app
[12:06:36] <rethus> thats what i'm talking about... i could try this
[12:06:51] <fr4nk> try xajax and you have all data in php
[12:07:00] <Indeede> is there a way to pass a parameter without appending it to the URL?
[12:07:41] <rethus> indeede: put to hidden textfield and use formular post
[12:07:54] <rethus> or use ajax
[12:14:23] <Indeede> i'll use a global variable instead
[12:14:39] <BinaryKitten> use ajaxsetup
[12:14:49] <Indeede> i have a site that is navigated with hash tags
[12:15:12] <Indeede> but when you initially land on a page it will redirect to the one with hash tags
[12:15:35] <Indeede> and I want to allow the user to actually use the backbutton without the page redirecting to the hashtag one
[12:16:15] <Indeede> be able to use the back button i mean to page back past where they initially entered the site
[12:19:43] <larzen> Folks.. is there any way to compare two objects w/o comparing each method?
[12:25:49] <Indeede> crap, that doesnt work if they go back forward..
[12:26:08] <Indeede> er forward
[12:28:56] <operhiem1> I'm new at this. I'm trying have something happen when I click a button, and it looks like I need to wrap it in a <div> and register the click handler to that, but I'm doing something wrong. Any ideas? My code is http://dark-code.bulix.org/2w9pls-80211
[12:33:14] <polyrhythmic> operhiem1: .button() is a jQuery UI method, not jQuery core.  Also, click handlers work on buttons afaik
[12:35:18] <Indeede> oh it doesnt work at all blah
[12:35:33] <gurumelo> ?.button
[12:35:33] <bot-t> :button: Selects all button elements and elements of type button. http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/
[12:37:43] <Kuntau> ? each
[12:37:43] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:42:33] <rethus> is it possible to set the name of an object to "0227591871" (as String) ?
[12:43:09] <saschagehlich> did anyone ever try to catch keyup events when you have a fullscreen background video? :/
[12:44:48] <operhiem1> polyrhythmic: Thanks! This works: http://dark-code.bulix.org/avppz1-80212
[12:51:05] <polyrhythmic> operhiem1: yw :)
[12:53:42] <sean`> HI ALL
[12:56:02] <greedo> I can do a slideup on document ready but not a slidedown
[13:07:12] <Lomex> How do show up a dialog? Will I keep the element hidden before calling dialog() on it?
[13:08:56] <VeXii> refering to a plugin?
[13:09:03] <Lomex> I think its jquery dialog
[13:09:12] <Lomex> Sorry jquery ui
[13:10:02] <VeXii> sorry not that familiaer whith ui let me look 2 sek
[13:10:17] <Lomex> I think I got it
[13:10:21] <Lomex> but can you explain this syntax to m
[13:10:22] <Lomex> e
[13:10:22] <Lomex> var $dialog = $('<div></div>')
[13:10:31] <Lomex> What will $('<div></div>') do
[13:10:40] <Lomex> Will it create some sort of new <div></div> elements?
[13:10:40] <VeXii> it creates a new div
[13:10:51] <VeXii> thats not appendet to the dom
[13:11:01] <Lomex> Thats weird :D
[13:11:14] <Lomex> So where are they placed? :D
[13:11:14] <VeXii> its quit handy tbh
[13:11:22] <VeXii> you can do $(
[13:11:42] <Lomex> I know how the SELECTOR stuff works, but im not familiar with the creating stuff
[13:11:55] <VeXii> you can do $('<div><div>',{ class = 'foo'}).html('hey from foo');
[13:11:56] <Lomex> So I could call .html on them?
[13:12:00] <Lomex> yes right
[13:12:07] <VeXii> yeah
[13:12:11] <Lomex> And where is it placed?
[13:12:18] <VeXii> but remimber its not going to show anywhere
[13:12:18] <Lomex> I mean created
[13:12:28] <VeXii> you need to append it to the DOM
[13:12:37] <Lomex> Yes but I could do that dialog() thing on them I think
[13:12:38] <Lomex> TO show up
[13:12:46] <VeXii> whith before()/after()/append()/appendTo()
[13:13:11] <Lomex> yes thanks
[13:13:15] <Lomex> Thats really cool :-)
[13:13:18] <VeXii> im not sure but imho it be a good pratice to place it somwhere in the DOM first
[13:13:23] <VeXii> youre welcome :)
[13:14:20] <Lomex> Yes but thats exactly what I need
[13:14:24] <Lomex> i dont want to place it in the DOM
[13:14:31] <Lomex> Its a dialog It should just "SHOW UP" ^^
[13:14:39] <Lomex> I was confused because I thought all elements have to be in the DOM
[13:14:49] <Lomex> and you just teached me they not
[13:15:46] <rethus> BinaryKitten: yeah, got it!!! With ajax and php.
[13:16:14] <Indeede> do session cookies only get deleted when the browser is closed?
[13:17:21] <rethus> with ajax - data: is there a way to send more than one Object?
[13:18:37] <Lomex> Indeede: I think this depends on browser settings and how long you set the cookie to last?
[13:19:04] <puddy> i'm having some confusing using the JQUERY UI Autocomplete widget, how do I pass the get parameter to the php backend?
[13:19:28] <Indeede> its set as a session cookie
[13:19:39] <puddy> confusion*
[13:26:23] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i convert the $ to jquery. means if i write $ i want to get jQuery
[13:26:57] <aaairc> Would someone be able to tell me why the "boxHeight" position is measured correctly in this --- http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/ujM38/8/ ---, using Firefox and Safari... but in Chrome, it basically comes back with the height of just the text... vs the height of the text AND the image that is loaded within the $box.
[13:36:38] <aaairc> here is a simpler version of the page i was talking about... take a look at the difference between boxHeight in Firefox or Safari   vs    Chrome     ---    http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/3yfRE/3/
[14:02:01] <rethus> how can i paste an object, with two other objects inside - with jquery ajax?
[14:02:18] <rethus> if i do data: userObj, i alway get undefined
[14:02:29] <rethus> if ui do data: userObj[0], it work for this object
[14:03:45] <zalun> hi guys
[14:03:51] <zalun> 1.6.2 is on jsfiddle
[14:03:59] <ryanneufeld> yay!
[14:04:04] <zalun> :)
[14:04:05] <ryanneufeld> <3+ jsfiddle
[14:04:23] <ryanneufeld> and bot-t
[14:04:26] * ryanneufeld hugs bot-t

[14:04:41] * bot-t dodges zalun's attack and slaps back!
[14:04:51] <zalun> :)
[14:04:52] <rethus> how can i send this with jquery.ajax - data: object(object[1],object[2])
[14:05:31] <ryanneufeld> rethus: an array of JSON would do it
[14:05:37] <rethus> if i send the objects each by its own, it works. but not encapsulated in another object
[14:06:01] <rethus> problem is userObj has "unknown" count of values
[14:06:21] <rethus> userObj[1], userObj[2]... could be 1 or 1000
[14:06:28] <rethus> any idea how to handle it
[14:07:49] <ryanneufeld> rethus: an array
[14:08:06] <ryanneufeld> are you hitting a php script?
[14:08:10] <rethus> i have an object
[14:08:18] <ryanneufeld> that's nice
[14:08:23] <rethus> inside of this object, there are another objects (one per user)
[14:08:26] <ryanneufeld> you can have an array of objects too
[14:08:39] <ryanneufeld> well, that's a bad design then
[14:08:46] <rethus> in which way
[14:08:49] <ryanneufeld> you need your objects in an array
[14:08:54] <ryanneufeld> if you want to iterate over them
[14:09:26] <ryanneufeld> [{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"}]
[14:09:38] <ryanneufeld> as an example of JSON that could get returned in the ajax
[14:09:43] <ryanneufeld> of better yet
[14:09:57] <rethus> i have encapsulete them with extend() is there a simlar function for arrays
[14:10:00] <ryanneufeld> {"items":[{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"},{"key":"value"}]}
[14:10:09] <ryanneufeld> I need to see your code
[14:10:13] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ rethus
[14:10:13] <bot-t> rethus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:10:47] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/a9t0PD5V
[14:11:53] <rethus> whats with: $.makeArray(obj)
[14:13:33] <ryanneufeld> rethus: using extend that way won't work the way you're expecting it to
[14:13:37] <ryanneufeld> that returns a single object
[14:13:53] <ryanneufeld> so if obj2, and obj3 have the same feilds
[14:14:08] <ryanneufeld> the values of obj3 will overwrite the values of obj2
[14:14:26] <rethus> i know. i have one global object. Into this, i have "n" user-Objects. Inside of each user-Object, i have additional 3 Objects
[14:14:31] <rethus> thas the structure
[14:15:14] <ryanneufeld> do you need to access obj2 or obj3 uniquely?
[14:15:37] <rethus> you mean the user-objects?
[14:15:49] <rethus> yes.
[14:16:11] <ryanneufeld> what is obj2?
[14:16:41] <rethus> ah wait...
[14:16:47] <rethus> you mena my sourceecode...
[14:17:03] <rethus> no, obj2 and 3 is encapsulate as one obj in chanPbx
[14:17:33] <rethus> don't need to access to obj2 and 3
[14:18:22] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:19:23] <ryanneufeld> where does userObj come from?
[14:19:27] <ryanneufeld> what's it's structure?
[14:19:49] <ryanneufeld> also
[14:19:49] <ryanneufeld> $.extend({},chanGeneral);
[14:19:53] <ryanneufeld> that
[14:19:59] <ryanneufeld> is just giving you chanGeneral
[14:20:06] <ryanneufeld> it's completely useless code
[14:20:17] <ryanneufeld> you're extending an object into an empty object
[14:21:14] <rethus> maybe if i transform chanGeneral and chanPbx and chanCdrVar in jasaon at this point... it would be a better handling to send it?!
[14:21:34] <rethus> is there a function in json to convert an object into json
[14:22:15] <sean`> hello all
[14:22:16] <ryanneufeld> JSON.stringify
[14:22:25] <sean`> I have come to help your jqueries
[14:22:37] <sean`> ?json2 @ rethus
[14:22:37] <bot-t> rethus, Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)
[14:22:57] <sean`> tihs is a fallback for when your browser does nto support JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[14:24:54] <ryanneufeld> sean`: nice
[14:36:39] <aaairc> anyone know why my .imagesLoaded() function provided with Isotope is working in Safari and Firefox, but not in Chrome. You can see example here http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/E6QKs/  . Thanks!
[14:39:07] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: what's supposed to do?
[14:40:31] <ryanneufeld> when I click the first time the page is loaded it loads the image
[14:41:16] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: afterLoad(resetAfterLoad); doesn't make any sense
[14:41:35] <ryanneufeld> as afterLoad doesn't have any parameters
[14:45:01] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: Its supposed to center the popup in terms of height
[14:45:12] <ryanneufeld> ew
[14:45:36] <ryanneufeld> That's really bad
[14:45:41] <ryanneufeld> what if I have a small screen?
[14:45:57] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: it hugs it to the top of the screen
[14:46:16] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:46:27] <ryanneufeld> so you're attempting to visually center it like a light box?
[14:47:17] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: i figured out all the logic from that perspective on how it should be positioned... but the issue is, is that when i measure the popup to figure out how to center it... in firefox and safari... it incorporate the height of the image that is going to be in the popup... which is what it should do
[14:47:43] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:47:55] <ryanneufeld> ff and safari work fine?
[14:48:00] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: in chrome however, when i calculate the height of the popup, it doesn't take the image into account. i figure its because its not waiting for the image to load which is why i'm using imagesLoaded()
[14:48:09] <aaairc> yeah safari and ff work as its supposed to
[14:48:43] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: so your attempting to visually center like a light box ---> yes
[14:49:10] <ec8or> i need to make submit a form using POST and parse the response as XML, but it is cross-browser so only way i can think of posting is jsonp
[14:49:16] <ec8or> but then i get a syntax error on the response...
[14:49:29] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: your imagesloaded function is doing nothing
[14:49:48] <ryanneufeld> ec8or: unless it's cross domain, you don't need jsonp
[14:50:02] <ec8or> yeah i meant cross-domain
[14:50:09] <ec8or> not cross-browser :)
[14:50:23] <ryanneufeld> okay, well, unless the server supports jsonp, you're hosed
[14:50:25] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: if you look at the click event, i define what the imagesLoaded is supposed to do
[14:50:33] <ec8or> ryanneufeld: ok cheers
[14:51:15] <ryanneufeld> np
[14:51:32] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: you're making it more complicated than it needs to be
[14:51:37] <ec8or> it is a payment gateway but i guess and can send it using php instead
[14:51:48] <ryanneufeld> ec8or: yup php/curl
[14:51:59] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: you only ever change it to the adjustPosition
[14:52:27] <aaairc> i only change it to adjustPostion... when the popup isn't visible
[14:52:46] <ryanneufeld> does it ever need to be anything else?
[14:53:01] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: if the popup is visible, but then the user click on another thumbnail, i don't want the position of the popup to change
[14:53:03] <ryanneufeld> why not have adjustPosition check for is(':visible');
[14:53:24] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: yeah that would be easier
[14:53:30] <ryanneufeld> yup
[14:53:42] <ryanneufeld> I'm guessing that it might also solve your problem
[14:53:48] <ryanneufeld> you may have a race condition
[14:53:55] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: let me try
[14:53:58] <sean`> ?ask @ JKarsrud
[14:53:59] <bot-t> JKarsrud, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:53:59] <ryanneufeld> beeing that V8 is stupidly fast
[14:54:25] <JKarsrud> lol sean`
[14:54:27] <JKarsrud> :P
[14:54:53] <ryanneufeld> gah! gross... ice cold coffee
[15:03:17] <rethus> anyone knows, how to convert an object - with n objects inside ) to jason ?
[15:03:25] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: still the same issue:   http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/j6T84/4/
[15:03:36] <bot-t> rethus, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[15:07:32] <ryanneufeld> aaairc: I'm not sure man
[15:07:41] <ryanneufeld> are you using the same image, or a new one?
[15:08:06] <aaairc> same image... just when its a thumbnail i'm setting the width to be small
[15:08:16] <aaairc> you think Chrome is using the image height from the thumbnail?
[15:08:38] <aaairc> before i bump it into the popup, where the width is set to be larger?
[15:08:54] <aaairc> i'll test...
[15:10:09] <initself> yo dudes, here's a simple fiddle: $("input[type=checkbox][checked]").change(function() { alert('ypo'); console.log('here');
[15:10:12] <initself> });
[15:10:17] <initself> shit!
[15:10:20] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/Qq5kR/
[15:10:43] <initself> as you can see, it works just fine.  however, on my site, no worky.  Is there an order in which i have to load code?
[15:11:28] <zalun> initself: you're using the onLoad wrapper
[15:11:36] <systemfault> Wrap the whole JS in a $(function() { code here})
[15:12:01] <initself> it's wrapped in this: $(document).ready(function() {
[15:12:06] <initself> isn't that correct?
[15:12:08] <systemfault> Yes
[15:12:10] <systemfault> Same thing
[15:12:18] <initself> ITSA NOTA WORKING!
[15:12:27] <systemfault> What browser?
[15:12:31] <initself> this is the site: http://vzdeals.mikebaas.org/
[15:12:40] <initself> you've gotta click one of the subcategories at the top.
[15:12:44] <initself> Firefox.
[15:13:00] <chabz> I'm using jquery.cycle and have code that works in IE but not Chrome or FF: http://pastebin.com/mfwQxXY4 I've never had code work in IE and not other browsers.
[15:13:00] <zalun> initself: you're using jquery 1.4 there
[15:13:05] <osmosis> im looking for a popup box, but not a ugly js popup, a clean css in page popup that contains some info when a button is clicked.
[15:13:15] * initself tries 1.4 on the twittle.
[15:13:34] <zalun> but it's working fine
[15:13:35] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/Qq5kR/1/ < 1.4.4
[15:13:37] <zalun> on jsfiddle
[15:13:51] <chabz> Is it a problem with the script being in the body/tags?
[15:13:53] * initself prays to the gods.
[15:13:56] <systemfault> First time I see someone use [checked]
[15:14:05] <systemfault> Instead of the pseudo selector
[15:14:11] <osmosis> these are good  http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/index.php
[15:14:13] <initself> systemfault: I don't know what I'm doing.
[15:14:19] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[15:14:24] <initself> systemfault: can you change the fiddle to what you would do?
[15:15:11] <initself> chabz: script is loaded at the start.
[15:15:13] <initself> afaik
[15:15:39] <systemfault> initself: I would do nothing special... input[type=checkbox]:checked instead of input[type=checkbox][checked] and I would add <label>s to the checkboxes.
[15:15:49] <systemfault> But it won't solve you problem AFAIK
[15:16:22] <initself> what the f!
[15:17:04] <chabz> initself: So the fact that it works in IE is not compliant?
[15:17:12] * initself checks.
[15:17:39] <initself> doesn't work in le chrome
[15:18:17] <systemfault> The checkbox are interpreted in a weird way..
[15:18:18] <initself> no worky in ie
[15:18:27] <systemfault> Like if you forgot a " somewhere
[15:18:40] <osmosis> I want something like this, http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/index.php ,  but having the dialog pop up close to the clicked button, and without the background page fading to grey. Also, a Copy button that copies the displayed text string into the users clipboard (if that is actually possible.)
[15:18:41] <initself> chabz: you are seeing http://vzdeals.mikebaas.org/ working in IE?
[15:18:49] <initself> systemfault: I'll check that out.
[15:19:53] <systemfault> initself: Check line 131 in json_deals.js
[15:19:56] <chabz> initself: the main image is scrolling left, is that what you are asking?
[15:20:12] <systemfault> initself: A " is missing to close the name attribute
[15:20:25] <rethus> i spend some houirs here to convert an object to json. can anybody give me a hint?
[15:21:05] <systemfault> rethus: var jsonString = JSON.stringify(yourObject);
[15:21:07] <tbranyen> rethus: $.parseJSON("...")
[15:21:36] <tbranyen> rethus: var myObj = $.parseJSON("{\"key\": \"value\"}");
[15:21:36] <initself> systemfault: I think I fixed that now, but it did not give me a better result.
[15:21:39] <rethus> is JSON. a placeholder or is this the real command?
[15:22:02] <tbranyen> rethus: okay cool ignore me :)
[15:22:06] <tbranyen> i can do the same!
[15:22:09] <rethus> tbranyen: from object to json not from json to opject
[15:22:25] <systemfault> rethus: JSON is native but won't be available in older browsers, you will need json2.js
[15:22:28] <tbranyen> rethus: oh, yeah JSON.stringify
[15:22:34] <tbranyen> older browsers will need the json2.js file
[15:22:39] <tbranyen> to polyfill in that object
[15:22:45] <systemfault> tbranyen is t3h lulz
[15:22:47] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: i don't know... still doesn't seem to be working http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/j6T84/11/
[15:23:09] <tbranyen> https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js
[15:23:24] <aaairc> ryanneufeld: it seems like it worked the first time the browser loaded the image, for the very first run where i changed teh URL... but then if I tried it again, it didn't work
[15:23:42] <aaairc> meaning had the popup show a different image than the thumbnail
[15:23:48] <rethus> Uncaught Invalid JSON: Array
[15:26:27] <chabz> Are there any quirks with IE rendering js when other browsers won't?
[15:26:50] <systemfault> chabz: rendering JS?
[15:27:01] <chabz> executing
[15:27:37] <rethus> Any idea, what this means: Uncaught Invalid JSON: Array
[15:27:43] <initself> systemfault: what gave you the theory that it was an HTML syntax problem?
[15:28:03] <systemfault> initself: I just made inspect element on the checkbox then saw that the markup had a problem.
[15:28:29] <initself> systemfault: inspect element is in in jsfiddle?
[15:28:46] <systemfault> initself: inspect element is a function of your browser's debugger
[15:29:07] <systemfault> What is the browser your use to develop?
[15:30:03] <initself> Firefox.
[15:30:09] <initself> The markup looks great now.
[15:30:31] <initself> This website hates me.
[15:30:32] <systemfault> initself: You have firebug installed I hope.
[15:30:37] <initself> Yes.
[15:30:44] <initself> I used inspect element.
[15:30:49] <initself> To look at fine code!
[15:31:40] <initself> Maybe I have other screwy checkbox code somewhere else or something.
[15:31:58] <initself> If I narrow it down by class, if the markup within the class is good, maybe that'll work.
[15:32:08] <initself> oh, but I'm already using form.subcategory_list"
[15:32:33] <initself> aggravating
[15:40:55] <initself> Anymore ideas, kind friends?
[15:41:07] <initself> I am very stuck.  I wouldn't even know how to post to StackOverflow.
[15:42:38] <t0tti> Hi, in the $.ajax doc it says: "success callbacks are then invoked, in the order they are registered, if the request succeeds. They receive the returned data, a string containing the success code, and the jqXHR object". But i cant find information what the "success code" is and what i need to send from the server in order to influence it. Can someone help me with this?

[15:43:26] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:55:08] <kurisu> is it safe when using ajax _POST requests to update the url bar with _GET info so that a user can copy / sharre the link
[15:55:49] <kurisu> or is this the wrong room to ask in???
[15:55:59] <Hopsy> kurisu: define your problem
[15:57:36] <Hopsy> kurisu: ?
[15:58:23] <kurisu> not so much a problem... just figuring out the best way to code an ajax media library.... atm I'm using wpadmin_ajax to handle _POST date and return some data to display.... but I want the user to be able to link to a specific item / category in the media library, so I was thnking that I could probably just update the url bar with some _GET info in the url
[15:58:57] <kurisu> but not sure if this is a good/safe way to go
[15:59:10] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/y85zA/ can someone tell my, why no POST-Data arrive my php-script?
[15:59:22] <VeXii> aslong the thers not any sensitive data i think it sounds okay
[15:59:36] <rethus> the array userObj has many entrys, but if i do a print_r() in my php-file, POST is undefined
[15:59:59] <kurisu> ok cool... is there a better way to do what I want
[16:00:30] <VeXii> dont think ther is
[16:00:43] <VeXii> it is kind of preserving state
[16:01:02] <VeXii> so you cant realy make that "sharable" besides using the url
[16:01:09] <rethus> anyone see my mistake?
[16:01:22] <kurisu> ok... so I just need to modify the browser url... and strip any _GET data
[16:01:59] <kurisu> can jquery modify the browser url??
[16:02:03] <VeXii> but it can make the applcation more userfriendly if you addopt the REST system
[16:02:18] <VeXii> have a look at the BBQ plugin
[16:02:28] <kurisu> the REST system eh?!? I'll have to look into it
[16:02:37] <kurisu> thansk
[16:02:41] <VeXii> nå :)
[16:02:44] <VeXii> np**
[16:03:09] <kurisu> is it difficult to implement??
[16:03:35] <kurisu> low price coding for a mate... so I don't want anything too intense
[16:03:45] <VeXii> not realy
[16:04:10] <VeXii> depents what system youre using on the server
[16:04:18] <kurisu> cool... time to do 'some' more reading then
[16:04:35] <VeXii> love the buissnes :D
[16:04:45] <kurisu> system, as in php?
[16:04:55] <VeXii> yeah
[16:05:08] <kurisu> ok
[16:05:16] <VeXii> well i probly not do a production on it first time

[16:05:51] <rethus> anyone have an idea, why no data arrive my php-script (http://jsfiddle.net/y85zA/)
[16:06:07] <rethus> this should be right code, or did you see a failure
[16:07:27] <VeXii> what is userObject?
[16:08:03] <rethus> ii'll show you
[16:08:43] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/y85zA/1/
[16:08:49] <rethus> see it in HTML area
[16:08:53] <rethus> its a object
[16:09:10] <rethus> in html-area is the firebug output for it
[16:10:55] <VeXii> try and set the dataType
[16:11:00] <VeXii> hmm
[16:11:00] <rethus> i also can show you json encoded
[16:11:20] <rethus> which value for it?
[16:11:52] <VeXii> probly JSON
[16:12:01] <VeXii> or what did you wanner transfer it as?
[16:13:12] <rethus> have now transfer it as json... didn't work

[16:15:20] <VeXii> youre using php right?
[16:15:21] <rethus> even if i do print_r($GLOBALS); i see the env and server vars, but GET and POST are empty
[16:15:25] <rethus> yes
[16:15:29] <VeXii> hmm
[16:15:41] <rethus> maybe i've to restart my browser.
[16:15:58] <VeXii> and thers no errors in the ajax object?
[16:16:06] <Sora_> u dont need parse json only put dataType: 'json'
[16:16:44] <VeXii> needs to on the server
[16:16:58] <rethus> no error on ajax request
[16:17:03] <rethus> only empty result
[16:18:16] <rethus> Array([undefined] => undefined) is the result of the request of ajax.
[16:19:30] <rethus> if i change data: to {"asdf": 123} it worked... it give me print_r back
[16:19:55] <Sora_> but u don define object in data

[16:23:04] <t0tti> Hello =) ATM i am triggering a server workflow using $.ajax and on server side (PHP) return a JSON object specifying a resultCode and some html to display.In dependency of the resultCode the client side does some more jQuery stuff. Is there a way to get rid of the resultCode in the JSON object and let jQuery handle it? What i mean is something similar to the 'statusCode' setting for $.ajax
[16:23:04] <t0tti> without implementing it myself? (I can't change the HTTP status code)
[16:26:19] <ajpiano> t0tti, you could probably write an ajax transport to handle it
[16:26:38] <ajpiano> so that you could map your resultCode to a what your ajax requests will eventually see as the request
[16:26:39] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[16:27:40] <t0tti> looks grat *_*, thanks for the hint =)
[16:28:07] <rethus> Sora_: any idea
[16:30:25] <Sora_> oh let me see
[16:41:26] <osmosis> I want something like this, http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/index.php ,  but having the dialog pop up close to the clicked button, and without the background page fading to grey. Also, a Copy button that copies the displayed text string into the users clipboard (if that is actually possible.)
[16:41:49] <osmosis> Anyone available to make this for me?  Ill pay a quarter bitcoin.
[16:43:45] <nezZari> what the hell is a quarter bitcoin
[16:43:50] <nezZari> is that anything like $50 ?
[16:44:56] <operhiem1> nezZari: Looks like it's about $4?
[16:45:08] <jrockjiggz> osmosis: what you need is www.google.com
[16:45:20] <jrockjiggz> they have fantastic tools to help you with your problem
[16:45:38] <osmosis> im lazy though
[16:45:43] <jrockjiggz> me too.
[16:45:50] <operhiem1> osmosis: being lazy doesn't get much done unfortunately
[16:46:28] <jrockjiggz> i think asking for someone to talor something to your specifications is MORE work than just doing it yourself
[16:47:04] <jrockjiggz> and if you don't have the know-how - check out freelancers.net
[16:47:46] <jrockjiggz> * http://www.freelancer.com/sellers/
[16:49:07] <osmosis> truth actually im just have too much on my plate
[16:49:16] <nezZari> lol
[16:49:22] <nezZari> this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen
[16:51:08] <amid_hasan> hi. i have a jquery ajax script that pulls most recent posts from my blog and adds them to div on my homepage. however, the script is being called when i load other pages as well. how do i prevent this ajax from loading when i load other pages?
[17:00:05] <JKarsrud> amid_hasan: keep it local to the front page?
[17:00:15] <JKarsrud> like. Only include it on the front page?
[17:00:50] <amid_hasan> that works!
[17:00:55] <amid_hasan> thanks JKarsrud

[17:15:49] <dirtycockroach> Hi
[17:15:55] <dirtycockroach> Is it possible to include only the part of jQuery library which is being used?
[17:16:10] <dirtycockroach> Suppose I am only using a few of the jQuery functions say show, hide, animate and attr. Is it possible to obtain only the part of jQuery library which implements these four functions?
[17:16:26] <dirtycockroach> I don't mind using a tool such as a compiler or some dependency checking script.
[17:18:32] <miketaylr> dirtycockroach: not really
[17:18:48] <miketaylr> if you only use those 4, just write them yourself as standalone helper functions
[17:19:58] <dirtycockroach> miketaylr, No.. that was just an example. I meant whatever jQuery function I use.
[17:20:07] <dirtycockroach> functions*
[17:20:20] <miketaylr> oh ok
[17:20:23] <miketaylr> no, not possible
[17:20:44] <miketaylr> dirtycockroach: what's the point?
[17:21:01] <miketaylr> just link to the google CDN, it'll be cached, etc.
[17:24:20] <dirtycockroach> In some of our websites we only use a few jQuery functions like show, hide, animate. We could write our own functions then but suppose later if we need to use some jQuery plugin or some function in jQuery which is not easy to write we have to remove our custom javascript function and then rewrite it using jQuery.
[17:24:37] <dirtycockroach> Also some of the clients complain about the size even when it is small.
[17:25:45] <dirtycockroach> Are there any plans to write something like a dependency check script?
[17:26:31] <dirtycockroach> If it is not a wide requirement can you tell me how easy or difficult would it be to write my own dependency checking script?
[17:27:21] <dirtycockroach> Just need a pointer
[17:33:40] <aikInsaan> hello folks
[17:34:10] <aikInsaan> on the topic of visual studio intellisense...the vsdoc files only go upto v1.4.1
[17:34:31] <aikInsaan> does anyone here know what's the status of the vsdocs for the newer jquery versions?
[17:34:49] <aikInsaan> have vsdocs been discontinued...or are they kept elsewhere?
[17:34:50] <aikInsaan> thanks
[17:35:20] <Sora_> vs 2010 have js intellisense
[17:39:14] <aikInsaan> Sora_: i got vs 2010...its not working on mine....
[17:39:38] <aikInsaan> Sora_: any pointers on how to go about enabling/configuring it? thanks!
[17:40:22] <Sora_> u trying in aspx files or externals (.js)
[17:40:32] <Sora_> for default works in aspx
[17:40:47] <Sora_> in externals files put in the top
[17:41:22] <Sora_> this line /// <reference path="../jquery.js" />
[17:41:45] <Sora_> change ../jquery.js for the correct path
[17:42:20] <Sora_> or drag and drop the jquery js in the file xD
[17:42:45] <aikInsaan> so i have an asp application
[17:42:59] <aikInsaan> i am referencing all scripts in .master file
[17:43:18] <aikInsaan> and writing client side js in separate files for respective asp pages
[17:43:22] <Sora_> no this reference is only for intellisense
[17:43:32] <aikInsaan> how do i go about it in this case?
[17:43:51] <Sora_> drag & drop u jquery to the external js
[17:44:06] <Sora_> try
[17:45:36] <aikInsaan> so what do i do?
[17:45:54] <aikInsaan> i have a js folder in my solution which has jquery.js and a .vsdoc as well
[17:46:07] <aikInsaan> in the same folder sit the client side js
[17:46:08] <Sora_> u dont need vsdoc
[17:46:14] <aikInsaan> for which i'd like the intellisense
[17:46:21] <aikInsaan> okay...i'll get rid of that
[17:46:46] <Sora_> add this /// reference path=../pathtofile.js  in the first line of the js file
[17:46:53] <thebignoise> hi. is it possible to access commented out elements
[17:47:05] <thebignoise> ?
[17:48:15] <Sora_> use .html()
[17:48:48] <Sora_> and use regex for find comments
[17:48:49] <Sora_> .match(/<!--.*?-->/g)
[17:50:11] <kborchers> thebignoise: why would you want to do that? and to answer your question, a jQuery selector will not find your commented out elements
[17:50:36] <cheezus> hey guys, I'm using the jquery quicksand plugin and to test, I'm shuffling a list. Unfortunately, it seems to want to resize the li elements (presumably because I've got nowrap on one of the spans. Any idea how to avoid this resize while shuffling? http://screencast.com/t/YxkOktDn
[17:51:32] <thebignoise> kborchers i am screen scrapping and then traversing down a set of elements that were echoed from php, but i want to echo them commented so i dont have to then hide what i dont want with jQuery
[17:51:46] <thebignoise> if that makes sense
[17:52:20] <Sora_> thebignoise: http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/CLXUL/
[17:52:55] <kborchers> thebignoise: why don't you just hide them when generated in php instead of commenting and then show what you want? wouldn't that make it easier?
[17:53:28] <thebignoise> i think thats what i am doing
[17:53:52] <thebignoise> i did echo "<!--".$var."-->"
[17:54:04] <thebignoise> i can then use your preg_match
[17:54:07] <thebignoise> to look through that
[17:54:10] <thebignoise> regex rather
[17:54:20] <heedly> ?101
[17:54:21] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:54:51] <cheezus> hmm, works a little better if I set text-overflow to clip
[17:54:59] <thebignoise> yeah i think ive gotten

[17:58:19] <thebignoise> its telling me title is not defined. it possible its a jQ problem
[17:58:51] <thebignoise> and i tested in console to make sure that element exists
[17:58:52] <thebignoise> and it does
[17:59:11] <Sora_> u need declare title
[17:59:15] <Sora_> out of jquery
[17:59:40] <thebignoise> Sora_ that seems a bit redundant
[17:59:51] <kborchers> thebignoise: title is defined after the dom is ready, but you are trying to access it as soon as the browser gets to that line
[18:00:41] <thebignoise> kborchers ah shit your right
[18:00:52] <Sora_> add this $('#price').append(title);
[18:01:27] <kborchers> thebignoise: ^^^^ use that Sora_ is right. after you set title
[18:01:41] <Sora_> and remove document.write
[18:01:45] <Sora_> sry my english sux
[18:01:47] <Sora_> u.u
[18:01:57] <kborchers> thebignoise: also for your sanity, always use var and semicolons
[18:02:06] <thebignoise> yeah yea works awesome. TY Sora_ & kborchers

[19:06:59] <echo66> seriously, the framework is pissing me....works perfectly on the desktop browser
[19:07:05] <echo66> but on the iphone and ipad...baaah
[19:07:28] <echo66> (im talking about other error, nevermind now)
[19:07:38] <echo66> but any ideas for what i asked?
[19:07:38] <echo66> :S
[19:07:55] <echo66> 89.154.129.220/concierge
[19:08:01] <echo66> that is the web app adress

[19:09:26] <echo66> anyone? :/
[19:10:39] <thebignoise> echo66 what framework is it?
[19:10:56] <echo66> jquery mobile
[19:10:59] <echo66> the beta
[19:11:36] <echo66> http://jquerymobile.com/download/, the same links but im using the debug versions
[19:13:05] <echo66> the previous version was...
[19:13:08] <thebignoise> its b/c path.split is not a function
[19:13:14] <echo66> 1.0a4.1
[19:13:23] <echo66> b/c??
[19:13:57] <thebignoise> because
[19:14:35] <echo66> lol ok but
[19:14:50] <echo66> im not doing anything different from what i was doing with 1.0a4.1
[19:15:05] <echo66> i just replaced the links to the new version
[19:15:06] <echo66> :S
[19:15:34] <thebignoise> hmmm
[19:16:11] <systemfault> Seems it doesn't want an anchor
[19:16:13] <systemfault> Hmm
[19:16:20] <systemfault> At line 240
[19:16:45] <echo66> what file??
[19:17:29] <systemfault> concierge
[19:17:40] <echo66> let me check
[19:17:55] <systemfault> I never used jquery mobile.. So I just tried to debug with the tools
[19:17:56] <echo66> yes
[19:18:07] <echo66> im on that line
[19:18:14] <echo66> it just change the page
[19:18:20] <systemfault> Hmm
[19:18:22] <systemfault> Ah!
[19:21:53] <systemfault> Ok
[19:22:48] <echo66> the problem is that
[19:22:49] <systemfault> concierge.js line 240, try to replace $.mobile.changePage("#" + id, trans, reverse); to $.mobile.changePage($("#" + id), trans, reverse);
[19:23:00] <echo66> hmmmmm
[19:23:01] <systemfault> It _should_ work
[19:23:05] <echo66> ok, will do
[19:23:06] <DofLeFou> How can I get the selected row of a table in Jquery
[19:23:15] <DofLeFou> hint what should be searching for
[19:23:20] <systemfault> The way I understand it is that if you pass a string, it thinks it's a URL
[19:24:06] <systemfault> But again...
[19:24:14] <systemfault> I don't know anything about jquery mobile.
[19:24:20] <echo66> yes, its a url but refering to a page already in dom
[19:24:23] <echo66> oh no prob
[19:24:33] <echo66> :)
[19:24:34] <systemfault> You're not passing a url
[19:24:38] <systemfault> But a string.
[19:24:49] <systemfault> "#1" in that specific case.
[19:24:55] <echo66> but an url is a string lol
[19:25:03] <systemfault> Err
[19:25:11] <systemfault> Sorry, I messed up the sentence :P
[19:25:12] <echo66> oh sorry, you dont know the jqm
[19:25:29] <systemfault> Ahhhh
[19:25:32] <echo66> that means that the changePage will change to the page with that id
[19:25:40] <systemfault> I get it now
[19:25:59] <echo66> but...let me try that
[19:26:05] <systemfault> It won't work :/
[19:26:10] <systemfault> Sorry, I'm an idiot.
[19:28:43] <systemfault> Are you sure that changePage works with anchors?
[19:29:44] <echo66> yes
[19:30:23] <systemfault> echo66: What the debugger says is that it tries to call split on 1
[19:30:24] <echo66> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/api/methods.html
[19:30:40] <echo66> hmmm
[19:30:41] <echo66> but
[19:30:57] <echo66> that one comes from the url?
[19:31:00] <systemfault> echo66: It doesn't mentions anchors :/
[19:31:22] <systemfault> It mentions a url, or a dom element or an array with [from, to]
[19:31:38] <systemfault> HMm
[19:31:40] <echo66> strange o.O i always managed to use anchors
[19:31:41] <echo66> wtf
[19:31:43] <echo66> o.O
[19:31:47] <systemfault> I have a stupid idea..
[19:31:54] <echo66> shoot it
[19:32:07] <systemfault> Try to replace $.mobile.changePage("#" + id, trans, reverse); to $.mobile.changePage(location.pathname + "#" + id, trans, reverse);
[19:32:49] <echo66> hmmmm
[19:32:54] <echo66> why the pathname?
[19:33:06] <systemfault> Seems it really wants a url :(
[19:33:13] <systemfault> So I thought that perhaps..
[19:35:41] <echo66> now, im using the objects
[19:35:49] <echo66> $.mobile.changePage($("#"+id), trans, reverse);
[19:36:03] <DofLeFou> how cant get the selected index http://jsfiddle.net/ssnV2/
[19:37:11] <systemfault> echo66: That would select a node with the ID
[19:37:12] <echo66> but....
[19:37:17] <systemfault> That's not what you want.
[19:37:23] <systemfault> I've been stupid to suggest that.
[19:37:28] <echo66> you dont have anything that can use the select attribute
[19:37:42] <echo66> yes, it would, system fault
[19:37:44] <echo66> like in the docs
[19:38:00] <systemfault> DofLeFou: What do you mean?
[19:38:45] <DofLeFou> systemfault: when the user  click on the let see one of the input
[19:38:57] <DofLeFou> i wanna know what is the value of
[19:39:49] <DofLeFou> var id = $('#Index').val();
[19:39:53] <echo66> damn, i hate debugging frameworks
[19:40:31] <DofLeFou> i m doing var id = $('#Index').val(); ... but it always picks the first row
[19:41:46] <DofLeFou> if i click on the input wher the value = dof ... i want it to return the corresponding value of its $('#Index').val();
[19:42:06] <DofLeFou> in that case 1459
[19:42:39] <DofLeFou> I guess ... var id = $('#Index').val(); of the current selected row

[19:43:09] <bot-t> deflefou, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[19:44:01] <systemfault> DofLeFou: The markup is invalid.
[19:44:06] <djQuery> DofLeFou: WTF id has to be unique
[19:45:32] <DofLeFou> var id = $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#Index').val(); how about by the class?
[19:46:10] <DofLeFou> http://jsfiddle.net/ssnV2/2/
[19:47:47] <DofLeFou> for the current select row ... i want the get the value of id input field val
[19:49:32] <systemfault> You would use .live or .delegate I guess..
[19:49:54] <systemfault> But since you don't seem to know english, it's difficult to communicate with you.
[19:50:52] <DofLeFou> what make you think i dont speak english

[19:56:59] <Jee5us> Hi! I have problem removing items from a multidimentional array. Can anyone help me?
[19:58:09] <Jee5us> http://paste2.org/p/1511680 there is an example of my array and i would like to remove the first array from there
[19:58:23] <Jee5us> but I must be able to do it by its index
[19:58:31] <systemfault> That's not a multidimensional array...
[19:58:39] <systemfault> That's an array with 2 objects in it.
[20:00:00] <Jee5us> ookay...
[20:00:10] <systemfault> ?eval [1,2].splice(0, 1);
[20:00:11] <bot-t> systemfault: [1]
[20:00:48] <systemfault> ?eval var arr = [1,2]; arr.splice(0, 1); arr;
[20:00:49] <bot-t> systemfault: [2]
[20:00:51] <systemfault> See?
[20:01:02] <Jee5us> okey..I'll try that
[20:02:21] <systemfault> splice is more general, you could probably use .shift() too
[20:02:29] <systemfault> ?eval var arr = [1,2]; arr.shift(); arr;
[20:02:29] <bot-t> systemfault: [2]
[20:03:10] <Jee5us> shift pops out the first element, right?
[20:03:16] <systemfault> yes
[20:03:19] <echo66> oh god
[20:03:23] <echo66> this framework
[20:03:29] <echo66> gets a huge wtf rating
[20:03:30] <echo66> x.x
[20:03:42] <systemfault> Well, it's still beta quality afaik :(
[20:03:55] <echo66> it looks so awesome though
[20:03:56] <echo66> ;_;
[20:03:57] <Jee5us> splice removed items after even index 0
[20:04:07] <echo66> $.mobile.changePage("#"+id, trans, reverse); 	$("#"+id).addClass('ui-page-active'); 	$("#"+previousId).removeClass('ui-page-active');
[20:04:08] <echo66> lol

[20:04:28] <systemfault> echo66: HACK THE PLANET!
[20:04:31] <Jee5us> i spliced the object from the index 0 and it removed objects 1,2 too....
[20:04:40] <echo66> Jee5us
[20:04:42] <echo66> please

[20:43:07] <espeed> I'm using .insertAfter() to insert some stuff after the H1, but the inserted text doesn't show up until after the page loads. What's the best way to do this to minimize redraws?
[20:43:47] <djQuery> put it in the html before give the user the html
[20:44:01] <djQuery> hide it then do all your appending and hten show it
[20:46:35] <hopperfest> Not sure if this is JQuery or just javascript, but what does it mean when you start a variable name with  '$', such as $myvar = x; ?
[20:46:50] <djQuery> nothing
[20:47:14] <hopperfest> ah, so it was just used for 'style' ?
[20:47:26] <xDROPx> yes
[20:47:30] <hopperfest> some, php person i guess
[20:47:56] <xDROPx> some people use it to differentiate between jquery style objects and regular js objects
[20:48:08] <hopperfest> ah, ok
[20:48:22] <xDROPx> but - it still could have been some php guy :)
[20:48:33] <systemfault> Using $ in javascript is insanity..
[20:48:50] <xDROPx> yeah i don't do it either
[20:48:50] <djQuery> typicaly I wont use $ on mine unless they are going to be a jquery object. var x = 123, $x = $('.getsomething');
[20:49:36] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[20:49:42] <hopperfest> ok, thanks guys. i was wondering b/c i saw it used here https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar/blob/master/weekcalendar_demo_2.html
[20:50:00] <espeed> djQuery: thanks for the help. I normally live on the server side, and I don't understand exactly what you're saying -- You're saying put the text to be inserted in the HTML before the page loads, but hide the to-be-inserted text, and then append it?
[20:50:03] <hopperfest> djQuery: i see, that's what they did too
[20:50:42] <thebignoise> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2032738114 -- can someone please explain to me why that produces both my .append and $t is set = 1
[20:50:43] <djQuery> espeed: I ment put it there server side
[20:51:28] <thebignoise> hopperfest that's php in there
[20:51:44] <thebignoise> unless you wern't talking to me
[20:51:51] <thebignoise> lol
[20:52:18] <hopperfest> thebignoise: wasn't talking to you
[20:52:29] <thebignoise> hopperfest. k sry
[20:53:49] <espeed> The reason I need to insert it is because the H1 tag and content are coming from Sphinx, a Python API that generates documentation, and short of hacking the library, there is no way to modify this part of the HTML. So I'm trying to use insertAfter to avoid doing that.

[22:42:42] <ussher_> Im using the jeditable function for Jquery.  It works fine if the value is posted directly.  Both the VALUE and the ID arrive at the php script.  but when i try to go via a function i cant seam to get the ID to appear.  How do i pass the ID from the "STANDARD" function to the "submitEdit" function.  Pastebin is here: http://pastebin.com/baG0Gy1w  thanks
[22:49:55] <natrixnatrix89> Is it possible to add a jquery UI progressbar, when uploading files with jquery ajax?

[22:59:29] <ussher_> Sora_:  ill try.
[23:01:42] <ussher_> Sora_:  that just gives "id" or the assigned name of it "myId"  instead of the value.

[23:56:49] <Doonce> how do you change the text of a jquery ui button on click
[23:57:09] <Doonce> OR, how do you have buttons with just icons
[23:57:40] <Doonce> padding is all messed up on just icons..
