[05:33:12] <diverdude> Hi - why is the submit handler not invoked when i click submit? https://jsfiddle.net/x5f1grws/2/
[06:17:40] <paule32> hello
[06:19:04] <paule32> how can i hide ui-window?
[15:17:42] <CyberFingers> I just installed SEO Panel and getting a 500 status error code on a page when it a jquery. Does Apache have to be configured to get jqueries to work?
[16:04:15] <paule32> CyberFingers: jquery is frontend client framework
[16:04:40] <paule32> CyberFingers: so, it has nothing to do Apache issue
[16:04:54] <paule32> CyberFingers: 500 status error is internal error
[16:05:19] <paule32> CyberFingers: but, you can Apache configure with ssi
[16:05:47] <paule32> CyberFingers: this needs some settings, and you have to do restart Apache
[16:12:15] <CyberFingers> paule32 is there a way for me to confirm that the page requires ssi?
[16:15:40] <paule32> don't know, either the ssi page is display or not
[16:15:56] <paule32> ssi stand's for server side includes
[16:16:54] <paule32> so, you can set marks in your html files, and the apache2 server parse these points, and include/import static html files, or dynamic php files
[16:17:08] <paule32> php is parsed from apache server, too
[16:49:22] <CyberFingers> I was able to follow these instructions - https://my.esecuredata.com/index.php?/knowledgebase/article/30/enabling-apache-server-side-includes-on-ubuntu-14-04.
[16:49:54] <CyberFingers> No longer get 500 error but the page is just blank now
[16:55:28] <paule32> you know html ?
[17:02:38] <CyberFingers> it's a php file
[17:07:17] <CyberFingers> I see some errors in the apache log file now - AH01374: mod_include: Options +Includes (or IncludesNoExec) wasn't set, INCLUDES filter removed: /seopanel/seo-plugins-manager.php, referer: http://cyberfingers.net/seopanel/admin-panel.php
[17:07:45] <audioburn> $(Game.current_game_object.creator_problem_array).each(function(i,item){ console.log(i);}); is not working as intended. the array is something like ['1-2','3-4'] etc. can anyone help?
[17:17:30] <shoky> audioburn: you are logging the index instead of the item, it seems. if this is a plain array, don't use jquery for it, just use js.  array.forEach(item => console.log(item))
[17:18:04] <shoky> jquery is for DOM and ajax
[17:19:59] <audioburn> shoky: what happened to i? i need both i and item
[17:21:58] <audioburn> shoky: hello?
[17:25:53] <shoky> audioburn: i don't understand your question
[17:27:13] <audioburn> shoky: function(i,item), there is an i, index. your function does not have this
[17:27:30] <shoky> .forEach((item, i) => ...)
[17:27:42] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[17:27:47] <shoky> read the docs
[18:01:34] <SaraDR> Silly question, how do I select from a result (syntax-wise). I want to select tr's from.... <div id="body"><table><tr>....  I can get the body with $('#body') but how do I jump ontp the table, and then all tr's?
[18:02:58] <shoky> SaraDR: $('#body table tr') or $('#body > table > tr') if you want to make sure those are direct children
[18:03:14] <SaraDR> oh, that was simple.
[18:03:15] <shoky> or $('#body').find('table tr')  if you already selected $('#body')
[18:05:21] <SaraDR> Works perfectly. Thanks for clear and swift answer shoky :)
[18:06:25] <shoky> sure
