[02:05:21] <Cork> robertmaxrees: slight adjustment to that comment, you can there are ways to run ruby in the browser, that example isn't it though :)

[02:05:35] <robertmaxrees> haha
[02:06:04] <robertmaxrees> well aware stuff like that exists, but in context my point still stands ;)
[02:06:19] <Cork> a colege looked into it like 7-8 years ago for gigels
[02:06:42] <Cork> he did ruby > js > ruby > php embedding :)
[02:07:00] <robertmaxrees> big old yikes tbh ;)
[02:07:07] <Cork> it was SUPER fast... not :D
[02:07:36] <robertmaxrees> lol gil but in the browser
[02:53:14] <dimi1947> is it possible to remove the event handler which is set by object properties such as this https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gvtLd3e9/28/...it does not work as you see..the tootlip appears on lick despite off beingg used
[02:54:21] <robertmaxrees> if they aren't binding via jquery, then you're SOL.
[02:55:13] <robertmaxrees> to clarify - if they aren't bidning using jquery, then your next best bet is to remove the binding using native js./
[02:56:06] <dimi1947> ....removeEventListener?
[02:56:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener sure? :)
[02:58:01] <dimi1947> there is on problem though...
[02:58:43] <dimi1947> the above method has as second arg the function that created the eventListener in the first place...how can I possibly know that?
[02:59:08] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: none of that seems to be using jquery in the first place? maybe try ##javascript? :)
[03:00:06] <dimi1947> ok...
[08:37:23] <ItsAboutToGoDown> "ok..."
[08:37:28] <ItsAboutToGoDown> you little bitch ass
[08:38:02] <ItsAboutToGoDown> do you know who robertmaxrees is???
[08:38:04] <ItsAboutToGoDown> he is
[08:42:48] <ItsAboutToGoDown> sorry got caught up in something. yeah robertmaxrees owns a domain so powerful it could get to mars alone
[08:42:51] <ItsAboutToGoDown> yeah no kidding
[08:43:59] <ItsAboutToGoDown> domain showoff contest!
[08:44:20] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i have one domain. but it's only about half as powerful as robertmaxrees's
[08:44:59] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i have this other one in my aim though. it's probably, no its definitely, gonna be america's next #1 URL.
[08:47:48] <ItsAboutToGoDown> yeah i've spent a lot of money trying to get this domain. it's based on a TLD from an african country
[08:47:52] <ItsAboutToGoDown> ruled by some dictator
[08:48:33] <ItsAboutToGoDown> but just so happens my country's been taking in their refugees so it's win-win baby!
[08:50:03] <ItsAboutToGoDown> african, sorry i meant south american
[08:50:09] <ItsAboutToGoDown> no asian
[08:50:13] <ItsAboutToGoDown> no! austral-asian
[08:50:37] <ItsAboutToGoDown> no ok ok ok caucasus mountains
[08:57:27] <ItsAboutToGoDown> you guys have no idea what country i'm talking about :D
[08:57:32] <ItsAboutToGoDown> you all WISH you knew
[08:58:05] <ItsAboutToGoDown> but you have to get to know its people! learn how to interact like they do
[08:58:08] <ItsAboutToGoDown> get to know their leaders
[08:59:12] <ItsAboutToGoDown> it's quite the culture shock compared to iceland
[09:01:04] <ItsAboutToGoDown> hehe
[09:01:06] <ItsAboutToGoDown> unbeleivable
[09:02:02] <ItsAboutToGoDown> i mention iceland *now* you're paying attention
[10:45:25] <dimi1947> is thery an way a button is clikced and that event is trnasferred to another button...I am tryingg to avoid doing a separate event handler
[10:51:05] <Cork> dimi1947: no, you can't nest buttins onside other buttons
[10:51:16] <Cork> you can bind the listener on a shared parent though
