[00:11:00] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/hwp0d5vu/
[00:11:34] <DexDeadly> I tried to apply what I learned earlier and I'm having issues
[00:13:19] <DexDeadly> one my console is telling me pauseAll is not defined
[00:18:28] <DexDeadly> NM wrong syntax
[02:11:37] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/hwp0d5vu/1/ looking to see what I might be doing wrong or if this is even possible.  When I load a list of games based off a forloop i attach a pauseAll function to my button.  What I'd like to do is when I hit that button I want to retriggger my showgamedata function which replaces a div tag with updated information.  The fuction works and everything updates in the database
[02:11:37] <DexDeadly> however instead of total page refresh I'd like just that function to refresh the div
[02:16:29] <DexDeadly> actually i see its because its sending object Object as the string and not the event which is set.
[02:19:09] <DexDeadly> to much for the night but if anyone has an idea.  I just updated and it now sends it but its not pulling fresh

[06:18:23] <Aeroraver> hey guys, so i have this situation: <li><input><label></label></li>, i'm checking for the input to be checked, am i right in assuming that if i want values from the label, i have to call back to the parent and then select the value from the label using it as a child?
[06:24:28] <daslicht> Happy Holidays :)
[06:25:14] <hellyeah> hey
[06:25:26] <hellyeah> why all background is not blue in tooltip http://jsfiddle.net/og96jj7x/8/
[06:28:24] <printForever> is it possible to use $(this) and .not(this) in a single statement?
[06:29:13] <printForever> $(".content a").click(function() {  $(this).not(this).hide("slow"); });
[06:29:50] <hellyeah> i am not expert jquery user
[06:29:59] <hellyeah> but did you try that in jsfiddle?
[06:30:43] <printForever> write the question in jsfiddle?
[06:30:45] <printForever> why?
[06:30:53] <printForever> this is simple logical question
[06:31:47] <hellyeah> you can see it works or not in first place
[06:32:07] <printForever> thats why I'm asking here
[06:32:11] <hellyeah> channels have some policy first do whatever you can i guess (in my experience)
[06:32:28] <hellyeah> dont get me wrong :XD
[06:39:47] <printForever> ok, no help about that
[06:39:51] <printForever> second question
[06:40:04] <printForever> how to output the current HTML tag name?
[06:40:08] <hellyeah> you can see it works or not with jsfiddle dont be lazy
[06:40:19] <hellyeah> if i know the answer i can give it to you but i dunnop
[06:40:22] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[06:43:01] <printForever> .prop("tagName") doesent work for me for some reason
[06:50:25] <hellyeah> what console say?
[07:02:06] <cannap> can you not use .attr =?
[07:02:14] <cannap> ha is gone

[07:02:32] <hellyeah> i solved the issue yeha
[07:02:42] <hellyeah> cannap: do you know jquery ui
[07:02:47] <hellyeah> may i ask smt?
[07:03:01] <cannap> no
[07:03:09] <cannap> i dont use this because i dont like ;D
[07:03:23] <cannap> some times the drag and drop stuff but not more
[07:03:48] <hellyeah> ahah
[07:04:03] <hellyeah> i keep it in my mind i need some help on drag and drop stuff
[07:04:08] <hellyeah> xD
[07:04:12] <hellyeah> why you dont like it
[07:04:17] <hellyeah> it seems really handy
[07:04:23] <cannap> dont know
[07:04:32] <hellyeah> do you prefer to write that kind of thing from scratch?
[07:04:34] <cannap> i use react then i dont include "jquery"
[07:04:45] <cannap> no
[07:04:48] <cannap> i cant write this
[07:04:55] <cannap> i mean i never tried but
[07:04:57] <cannap> for what
[07:05:02] <cannap> there has many libs for this
[07:05:04] <cannap> they are fine
[07:05:07] <hellyeah> what are you doing with react? What is the purpose of that_
[07:05:17] <cannap> all in one file
[07:05:19] <cannap> :D
[07:05:27] <cannap> i like this conecpt
[07:05:31] <cannap> concept
[07:05:47] <cannap> but atm i learning a bit about graphql
[07:05:55] <cannap> this is fucking amazing you know? :D
[07:05:57] <hellyeah> graphql?
[07:06:03] <hellyeah> let me check
[07:06:13] <cannap> yea one schema as exmaple
[07:06:18] <cannap> and you can query the stuff you need
[07:06:27] <hellyeah> ic
[07:06:41] <cannap> withouth writting 1000 api app.get('api/v1/something'/)
[07:06:47] <cannap> there is a nice middleware for express
[07:06:54] <cannap> but i only readed
[07:06:57] <cannap> never touched atm
[07:07:01] <hellyeah> react has different syntax?
[07:07:05] <cannap> jsx
[07:07:15] <cannap> its like html in a String
[07:07:16] <hellyeah> i dont know that :o
[07:07:21] <hellyeah> ic
[07:07:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:07:43] <hellyeah> i sense like i need to learn angular and react
[07:07:44] <cannap> you have the events in the same file as the html as exmaple
[07:08:00] <cannap> but you can  simple pass the values props etc.. to a other component
[07:08:01] <hellyeah> it is inline coding isnt it?
[07:08:03] <cannap> its very easy
[07:08:13] <cannap> but at the first time its a bit weired
[07:08:25] <hellyeah> any tutorial or something can you suggest?
[07:08:38] <cannap> http://sahatyalkabov.com/create-a-character-voting-app-using-react-nodejs-mongodb-and-socketio/
[07:08:41] <cannap> its from null to deploy
[07:08:48] <cannap> but the serverside stuff is not 100%
[07:09:00] <cannap> he only render the layout stuff on the server and not the "data"
[07:09:15] <hellyeah> ic
[07:09:23] <hellyeah> so react is derivative of nodeJS?
[07:09:35] <cannap> you can install react with node
[07:09:47] <cannap> when you use browserify or webpack or jspm or how this new thing is called
[07:10:03] <cannap> and the good thing is you have hot reload
[07:10:10] <cannap> when you change some code in a "component"
[07:10:12] <hellyeah> first i need to learn nodeJS i guess
[07:10:14] <cannap> only this will refresh
[07:10:20] <cannap> and the rest will stay
[07:10:27] <cannap> yes
[07:10:31] <cannap> its not so hard
[07:10:46] <cannap> i dont know but its very different to they way like php works
[07:10:52] <cannap> for me
[07:11:07] <hellyeah> i am sure it is not hard
[07:11:09] <cannap> with the event loop some stuff is very simple
[07:11:15] <cannap> like websockets or
[07:11:16] <hellyeah> it just the matter of sparing time
[07:11:20] <cannap> you cant do this in php this way
[07:11:24] <cannap> its possible
[07:11:27] <cannap> but not official
[07:11:40] <hellyeah> i feel your enthasuasim
[07:11:47] <hellyeah> i enjot with that
[07:11:54] <hellyeah> really nice
[07:12:37] <cannap> but atm i learn express / reactjs / with mongo over graphql
[07:12:40] <cannap> but never done something
[07:12:51] <cannap> i dont release something before im not sure the shit is working 100%
[07:13:07] <cannap> sometimes when i writte promises or something i ask here i do this right way
[07:13:19] <cannap> and my english sucks hard :D
[07:13:40] <hellyeah> i understand your language well
[07:13:54] <hellyeah> mongo is big data right
[07:14:14] <hellyeah> mongodb
[07:14:27] <hellyeah> was that smt else?
[07:14:45] <cannap> its a database but not like mysql
[07:14:52] <cannap> you dont have "real" relationships
[07:14:55] <cannap> like in mysql
[07:15:13] <cannap> but they new version can now handle some join stuff
[07:15:16] <cannap> but not tested yet
[07:17:38] <hellyeah> nosql
[07:19:09] <hellyeah> ic
[07:19:35] <hellyeah> so basically you plan to write something for big data ?
[07:22:56] <cannap> i dont understand
[07:22:59] <cannap> sry
[07:23:45] <cannap> you can use sequelize or waterline then you can change easy between databses
[07:23:49] <cannap> but not to mogo
[07:23:50] <cannap> mongo
[07:24:10] <cannap> mongo is odm
[07:24:28] <hellyeah> ic
[07:24:42] <cannap> ic?
[07:25:05] <cannap> when i count some stuff in mongo i make a extra map for this
[07:25:16] <cannap> and use the pre hook or after delete stuff
[07:25:19] <cannap> and push the counts
[07:25:31] <hellyeah> pre hook?
[07:25:32] <cannap> i dont it is faster as using Something.find.count()..
[07:25:35] <cannap> yes
[07:25:37] <hellyeah> what is pre hook?
[07:25:40] <cannap> before you enter the data in the db
[07:25:42] <cannap> you can do something
[07:25:45] <cannap> like an event
[07:25:50] <hellyeah> hmm,
[07:25:59] <cannap> you can do this in mysql too
[07:26:00] <hellyeah> like clicking button?
[07:26:09] <cannap> yes when i click the button data pushes in the db
[07:26:10] <hellyeah> event in mysql
[07:26:15] <hellyeah> ah
[07:26:18] <cannap> but before its save i can do something other
[07:26:20] <hellyeah> understood
[07:26:30] <cannap> like a counter or for statistic stuff
[07:26:40] <cannap> how often any changed their profile
[07:26:42] <hellyeah> like html form -> click --- to the database
[07:26:48] <cannap> yea
[07:26:52] <cannap> yeah :D
[07:27:03] <hellyeah> it is east to do in php
[07:27:25] <hellyeah> are you trying to do that with reactJS?
[07:29:00] <hellyeah> easy*
[07:30:10] <hellyeah> i will brb
[07:41:52] <cannap> react has not much with the server to do
[07:42:02] <cannap> you can render react on the server and mount the stuff on the client
[07:42:07] <cannap> but its a bit complicated
[07:42:20] <cannap> i got this working but i made this the wrong way
[08:06:07] <hellyeah> hey
[08:07:08] <hellyeah> i want to show text of buttontext in tooltip. But it doesnt work but .prop('title') works do you have any suggestion about that? http://jsfiddle.net/og96jj7x/14/
[09:43:09] <Aeroraver> <Aeroraver> hey guys, so i have this situation: <li><input><label></label></li>, i'm checking if the input is checked, when it's checked i want to get the value of the label
[10:01:38] <motaka2> Is this enough to add a css to <head>                  $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="' + data.cssPaths[cssCounter] + '"' + cssAttrsStr + '/>').appendTo('head');  ?
[10:31:16] <DelphiWorld> yo
[10:32:14] <DelphiWorld> what's the event that should be triggered when i move a slider?
[10:50:58] <matyus> DelphiWorld: did you try $('#mySlider).on('change', function(){ //do stuff });
[10:51:26] <DelphiWorld> i allready got it, i'll post
[10:53:27] <DelphiWorld> matyus: see this: $('#volume').slider({
[10:53:38] <DelphiWorld> normaly this will create a slider into my div, no?
[10:56:43] <DelphiWorld> matyus: full code here: http://paste.debian.net/355054/
[11:08:17] <matyus> DelphiWorld: so are you using jQueryUi, if you have access to the .slider function?
[11:17:37] <motaka2> Is this enough to add a css to <head>                  $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="' + data.cssPaths[cssCounter] + '"' + cssAttrsStr + '/>').appendTo('head');  ?

[11:42:52] <dan_j> Hi. I'm using chartjs to display a 12 month bar chart.
[11:43:11] <dan_j> I want to be able to click on a month and the bar chart is replaced with a 30 day view for that month.
[11:43:32] <dan_j> Has anyone seen a better chart to do this with? I want it to animate the change nicely.
[12:37:19] <Dr-007> good evening, i'm looking for a little info before im building it. recently someone said you should use jquery('.something').data('somethingyouwanttorememberd', datatobesaved);
[12:37:39] <Dr-007> instead of creating the attribute via attr('data-somethingyouwantremembered);
[12:37:40] <robertmaxrees> for some things, yes.
[12:37:43] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:37:46] <Dr-007> because it is faster
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> always use .data() for data attributes.
[12:38:17] <Dr-007> do you know what happends if the page refreshes? will the page remember the .data() i placed?
[12:38:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> just like everything else, it goes away.
[12:38:53] <robertmaxrees> the only things that will persist in browser are cookies and localstorage/sessionstorage
[12:39:05] <Dr-007> ah yeah
[12:39:09] <Dr-007> thats probably it
[12:39:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[12:39:25] <DelphiWorld> hi guys
[12:39:32] <Dr-007> im using tagit to create labels inside a textfield. these labels get placed back if the page reloads
[12:39:35] <DelphiWorld> any plugin that make it easy to use localstorage?
[12:39:48] <Dr-007> but these labels get converted to tags,tags,tags and placed inside the textfield
[12:39:49] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 ah.
[12:39:59] <Dr-007> so thats why they return probably
[12:40:01] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld it's... pretty easy to use as-is.  not need for a plugin.
[12:40:10] <Dr-007> allright, thanks once again, robert
[12:40:21] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[12:40:32] <DelphiWorld> cool, robertmaxrees
[12:45:01] <DelphiWorld> could someone make it clear when should i use cookies or local storage?
[12:45:06] <DelphiWorld> i am doing a mobile app
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld what do you need to store?
[12:45:47] <DelphiWorld> audio volume state, current selected option in a <select> list
[12:46:04] <robertmaxrees> do you expect to store more data?
[12:46:26] <robertmaxrees> because localstorage sounds like your best bet.
[12:47:28] <DelphiWorld> no,  no much data at all
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> I'd still use localstorage.  it'll be easier to work with.
[12:48:16] <DelphiWorld> ok, taking your recomandation
[13:20:43] <Aeroraver> I want to select items, every item i select has to be written to a label,when i unselect an item i want it to be removed from the label, what's the best way to achieve this?
[13:21:17] <robertmaxrees> start with a fiddle and we can step through it.
[13:38:12] <DelphiWorld> is this correct?     $('#cast').prop("volume", this.value/100);
[13:38:16] <DelphiWorld> deviding the value by 100
[13:39:32] <Aeroraver> https://jsfiddle.net/aeroraver/eypxphab/2/
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> this.value is probably a string, DelphiWorld
[13:39:56] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: so how should  i devide it by 100?
[13:39:59] <robertmaxrees> Aeroraver missing jquery.
[13:40:03] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: this.value is comming from a input range
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld need to convert this.value to a number first.
[13:40:18] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: hmmm
[13:40:30] <Aeroraver> robert: https://jsfiddle.net/aeroraver/eypxphab/3/
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you can use pareseInt or parseFloat depending on what kind of number it is.
[13:40:47] <robertmaxrees> Aeroraver so what's your question?
[13:41:22] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: it's a range, from 0 to 100
[13:41:39] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld it depends on if you expect it to have decimals or not.
[13:41:53] * DelphiWorld is confused
[13:41:57] <Aeroraver> well i have these items, I want to be able to select multiple, fill the preview label with all selected items, but i also want to remove the value of an unselected item from the preview
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you have a string, but you want to do math against it, right?
[13:42:14] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: its a number.
[13:42:18] <DelphiWorld> its a volume slider
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld not if you're doing this.value
[13:42:22] <DelphiWorld> from 0 to 100
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you're conflating values with types.
[13:42:37] <DelphiWorld> but the audio volume expect from 0.0 to 1.0 so i should devide by 100
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld this.value is usually of type string.
[13:43:29] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i see...
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld so you need to convert from a string to a number to do math with it.
[13:43:37] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: if i use alert its displaying a number
[13:43:45] <DelphiWorld> i'll try
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> do typeof this.value;
[13:44:04] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:46:04] <DelphiWorld> lmao... its working!
[13:46:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:46:24] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i'll pb ;)
[13:46:28] <robertmaxrees> "pb"?
[13:46:32] <DelphiWorld> i mean volume is changing :P
[13:46:38] <DelphiWorld> pb=pastebin
[13:46:44] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: btw merry christma all
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> i wish ;)
[13:48:54] <DelphiWorld> :P
[13:49:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty rough year.  don't really have anybody to spend christmas with, so i'm not really looking forward to it.
[13:53:16] <Aeroraver> so do you have any suggestions robert?
[13:53:37] <robertmaxrees> Aeroraver i'ma be honest - you tossed a LOT of things at me.
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time.
[13:54:04] <Aeroraver> alright
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> so what's the first thing?
[13:54:09] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i loved the term tossed :-P
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> uh, 'kay
[13:54:43] <Aeroraver> i want to get the value of every selected item in the list to appear in the preview label
[13:55:00] <robertmaxrees> what's "the preview label"?  #preview?
[13:55:04] <Aeroraver> yes
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm pretty sure you can't use labels like that, can you?
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> that should be a span or div or something instead.
[13:55:47] <Aeroraver> hmm ok, i mean, i know i can write the value of one selected item to it right now
[13:55:52] <robertmaxrees> either way - you want the change event here, and you could use .map() to accomplish this pretty easily.
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't normally do this Aeroraver, but https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eypxphab/4/
[14:01:20] <bojanlazic> How bad is to include 2 jQuery versions?
[14:01:39] <bojanlazic> Will there be a conflict?
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> if you don't do it right, yes.
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> and doing it right is dumb - just use 1.
[14:02:11] <Aeroraver> robert, thanks, i was about to get there :)
[14:04:28] <Aeroraver> ok so if i see it correct, you handle both the selecting and deselecting by looking at the change on the input, and for every change it either builds the list or removes something due to the change event?
[14:04:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> only builds the list.
[14:04:44] <robertmaxrees> never does a remove.
[14:05:03] <robertmaxrees> .filter() gets me the selected items, and .map().get().join() formats the data the way you want it.
[14:05:10] <Aeroraver> cause when i deselect an item it is removed from the preview
[14:05:24] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's fully rebuilding it all every time.
[14:06:29] <Aeroraver> ahh like that, thanks again, i was already thinking of complicated things like building arrays and using substrings to remove the items from the preview
[14:06:51] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD do that, but there's really no reason to.
[14:39:54] <Aeroraver> i propably need to do some debugging, in fiddle the code works perfectly, but in the application i'm working on it doesn't...
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[14:40:18] <Aeroraver> the text won't appear in the label
[14:40:28] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:41:25] <Aeroraver> no errors
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating anything?
[14:42:04] <Aeroraver> well the items in the list are dynamically generated
[14:42:12] <Aeroraver> but that's a one time thing
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> what about #itemList ?
[14:42:27] <robertmaxrees> is that element dynamically created?
[14:42:31] <cooldman224> Hi all, trying to figure out to create this html in jquery as opposed to a string but my html() is missing quite a few elements. need help understanding http://pastebin.com/FjLfmCGw
[14:42:53] <Aeroraver> #itemList itself is static, the child elements are generated
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> cooldman224 what are you confused about?
[14:44:13] <robertmaxrees> cooldman224 also, why not just use strings?
[14:44:38] <cooldman224> robertmaxrees: why html() isn't rendered from my jquery object. because i prefer the object builder syntax
[14:45:01] <robertmaxrees> cooldman224 you're doing this really awkwardly.
[14:45:04] <robertmaxrees> just use strings.
[14:45:12] <robertmaxrees> or get a templating engine and use that.
[14:45:37] <cooldman224> robertmaxrees: i dont think it's awkward
[14:45:47] <robertmaxrees> except for the fact that you're having issues ;)
[14:46:39] <cooldman224> it gets to be a big mess with single quotes and concating
[14:46:53] <robertmaxrees> which is why you use a templating engine instead.
[14:47:23] <cooldman224> it's part of the JS generated on the fly and not in the template
[14:47:36] <robertmaxrees> there are templating engines for JS.
[14:47:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can do this, just need to rethink your approach a little.
[14:48:18] <cooldman224> all right
[14:49:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z4Lox0k/
[14:50:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're awkwardly juggling things around - jquery's not very good at being a templating engine.
[14:51:24] <cooldman224> Ah i see what you're doing. i was trying to chain them together
[14:51:37] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, but I'd really advise against it.
[14:55:02] <cooldman224> i see. i'm creating a html string so i'll have to do something like this in the end: $myDiv.wrap('<span>').parent().html()
[15:16:03] <cooldman224> robertmaxrees: another question i have is why not use wrap() instead of append()?
[15:16:20] <robertmaxrees> just the mental overhead imo.  i prefer thinking that way.
[15:19:25] <cooldman224> gotcha. i prefer the wrap. althought it doesn't work $myP.wrap($myDiv);
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:56:13] <nezZario_> Maybe I missed something in the docs but is there any functional difference between $('table#list').on('click', 'td.foo', function() { }); and $('table#list').delegate('td.foo', 'click', function() { }); ?
[17:57:06] <rcyr> I don't think there's a difference.... AFAIK, there's no reason to use .delegate these days
[17:57:15] <rcyr> Both do event delegation
[17:57:45] <rcyr> .delegate was pre-.on
[17:58:49] <nezZario_> ahh ok, gotcha.  thanks.
[18:05:32] <nezZario_> I'm trying to do $('#container').append('<div id="foo" style="display: none">bar</div>'); $('#foo').slideDown() and of course it doesn't work because I'm guessing it isn't initialized yet ?
[18:06:05] <nezZario_> do I need to do some kind of special callback or something.. there is no "after" type thing as with slideDown('fast', andThen...)
[18:11:30] <nezZario_> nvm I'm dumb.  It was a variable I was using for the slideDown() and I forgot to prepend the # for id
[18:42:59] <phelix> So I have a bunch of plces in my script that i want to replace html into... Is there a way I can store those into html template files and replace them with that so that I don't have to write this html inside my js file?
[18:47:41] <matyus> phelix: have you looked into anyhting like mustache.js (https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/#templates)
[18:48:11] <matyus> the "include templates" header might be what you want
[18:48:14] <phelix> yea, I don't have access to anything like that. This seems more like I would need some type of server side language to pull that off properly
[18:48:44] <phelix> I just don't like putting html inside my js. makes it look sloppy lol
[18:49:00] <matyus> mustachejs can be client side OR server side
[18:50:18] <phelix> Yes, but I can't install mustachejs. I am developing an app for a device that runs tizen SDK on it. I wouldn't be able to get mustache configure and setup properly on this environment
[18:51:16] <matyus> so does that mean you're not able to install jquery either?
[18:51:48] <phelix> Well, I am able to put it locally inside a folder and call it that way. Is mustache that easy to add?
[18:52:21] <matyus> yeah, that's what I meant when I said it can be client side, it's not different than including jquery
[18:52:30] <phelix> Maybe, I'll have to look into it more. Not sure I wanna add and deal with another library just so that I don't have to put html in my JS..
[18:52:38] <phelix> hmm, well let me look into it.
[18:53:43] <matyus> yeah! it's pretty convenient
[18:54:10] <matyus> phelix: if you're building a tizen app, does that mean you work at Samsung
[18:54:26] <phelix> nope. Just playing with the Tizen SDK
[18:54:59] <phelix> just got that Gear S2 and the apps are super limited. Writing some cool apps for it.
[18:57:47] <matyus> ah nice
[18:58:18] <phelix> yea, its a pretty snazzy little unit =)
[18:59:21] <matyus> I like how it's round and not square/rectangular like the apple watches
[18:59:46] <matyus> though I could see that being really annoying to design/dev for a circular viewport
[19:00:29] <phelix> Yea, I just got the new one with the 3G, so its actually connects to the provider and has its own phone number. And Also the phone. So now if I am not within bluetooth range on my phone I can still receive phone calls from it and text messages etc.
[19:01:22] <phelix> Yes it is a little annoying. Not that bad though. It scrolls so just gotta worry about top corners. But if it gets cut off they can just scroll down or up to see.
[19:04:08] <matyus> didn't know that it could have its own phone number. haha that's crazy
[19:04:25] <phelix> yea, pretty sweet. only 5 bucks a month
[20:19:29] <dpy> does anyone know how to make all jquery-mobile widgets smaller on larger but low-dpi displays? (e.g. a desktop monitor)
[21:19:51] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/hwp0d5vu/1/ looking to see what I might be doing wrong or if this is even possible.  When I load a list of games based off a forloop i attach a pauseAll function to my button.  What I'd like to do is when I hit that button I want to retriggger my showgamedata function which replaces a div tag with updated information.  The fuction works and everything updates in the database
[21:19:51] <DexDeadly> however instead of total page refresh I'd like just that function to refresh the div
[21:20:04] <phelix> It seems that when my ajax returns a 400 (bad request) it is killing my script. Anyway to have the script ignore this and continue running?
[21:28:16] <dpy> too bad, it looks like jquery mobile is hard-coded for a certain pixel density
[21:28:35] <dpy> no way to manually scale all the widgets/controls in one go
[21:31:41] <phelix> should getting a 400 bad request error on a ajax request kill the script? Shouldn't it still keep running?
[21:37:52] <shoky> phelix: no it shouldn't kill a script
