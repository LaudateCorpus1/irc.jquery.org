[15:28:01] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: sooo guess what :) they're ending up doing the upgrade for me
[15:28:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:29:11] <AndresInSpace> from last week I was asking about jquery vulnerabilities cause I wanted VWO to use the copy I had on page already (3.x) instead of 1.x-2.x as their code hasnt been upgraded to work with 3.x yet
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:29:26] <robertmaxrees> ok
[15:29:34] <AndresInSpace> as every vwo test was introducing another jquery library for it to work since they couldnt use the copy already loaded
[15:29:49] <robertmaxrees> 'k.
[15:29:54] <AndresInSpace> :P
[15:30:02] <AndresInSpace> If you don't ask, you don't get!
[15:30:12] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i don't really remember what you're talking about but cool :)
[15:30:34] <AndresInSpace> ah well, just wanted to let you know and thank you again for your help
[15:30:43] <robertmaxrees> alright.  glad i could help!

[15:41:01] <grapheti> in Russian accent*
[16:30:47] <jak2000> hi all i have this: <button type='button' class='myclass' id='A342342.png'>Erase</button>   how to get the id? var myClass = wRenglon.find(".clBorrarFile").text();
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> you just want the ID of an element?
[16:31:26] <robertmaxrees> also: why is the ID a filename?
[16:32:06] * robertmaxrees plays jeopardy think music
[16:32:48] <jak2000> yes
[16:32:55] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id')_
[16:33:00] <robertmaxrees> *.prop('id')
[16:33:02] <jak2000> i need erase the file...
[16:33:06] <jak2000> ok
[16:33:20] <robertmaxrees> wait do you want to set the id or just get its contents?
[16:34:36] <jak2000> just get id content in this case: A342342.png
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't get what you mean by that, but you can just use .prop('id'
[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> ** .prop('id') - though i'd fix your backend to not push filenames into the ID like that.
[16:37:00] <grapheti> I'd fix your back-end to include a hyphen.
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> hurr
[16:38:02] <grapheti> harrrrr harrrr
[16:38:47] <robertmaxrees> so funay
