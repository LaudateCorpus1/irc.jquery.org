[00:29:44] <sammych1> wish there was syntax to do defaults in the function signature
[00:30:07] <sammych1> function hey(arg || {})
[00:30:44] <workerbeetwo> hard it really be so hard to request an xml file from a different domain server running on just a different port?
[00:30:52] <workerbeetwo> (cross domian issue)
[00:31:09] <workerbeetwo> *can it really be so hard
[00:31:10] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone stil here
[00:31:25] <systemfault> workerbeetwo: Setup CORS on your server :/
[00:31:32] <Vivekananda_y510> I was wondering if someone could help me with some javascript/jquery problem
[00:31:50] <Vivekananda_y510> but that actual problem is different though
[00:31:51] <workerbeetwo> systemfault: I failed to.
[00:32:18] <systemfault> :/
[00:33:01] <Cork> sammych1: there is in es6 :)
[00:33:07] <sammych1> no, Vivekananda_y510, you should go to #javascript/jquery for that kind of help
[00:33:30] <sammych1> of course there is ;)
[00:33:59] <workerbeetwo> systemfault: see this : http://pastebin.com/BEjPpZUW  didnt work out.
[00:35:28] <Vivekananda_y510> I am in jquery I guess
[00:35:49] <workerbeetwo> systemfault: solved nothing. that apache config, because that other requested server needs to explicitly do something, which is not undermy control. its just an xml server man.
[00:36:10] <Vivekananda_y510> just wondering if someone had a few mins to look at it and tell me what I need to do or is there anything I could do or I cannot
[00:36:24] <Vivekananda_y510>  trying to mirror a demo dashboard ( not in drupal) on my localhost in drupal. I have most of it functioning but the graph demo with live graphs does not work. The original demo site is : http://192.241.236.31/themes/preview/smartadmin/1.4.1/ajaxversion/  and I have localtunnel  here :  https://756703c1.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html
[00:44:19] <flam_> has anyone used jquery-ui with drupal?
[00:44:42] <Cork> ?ask @ flam_
[00:44:43] <b-ot> flam_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:46:55] <flam_> well i'm using drupal's jquery-update module which by default only adds jquery-ui's core script to the pages. i tried to add jquery.ui.date.min.js and then when i did $('someinputfield').datepicker(); and clicked on the input field i got error "Uncaught TypeError: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[00:47:35] <flam_> how should i go on about solving this, am i including datepicker's code using some way from drupal's point of view?
[00:47:44] <flam_> i'm using chromium
[00:49:00] <Cork> flam_: sounds like your adding an old version of jquery ui
[00:49:11] <Cork> that depends on a pre 1.9 version of jquery
[00:49:15] <mooncup> morning all
[00:49:28] <mooncup> do you offer support for any plugins or just jquery proper?
[00:49:29] <Cork> flam_: so either grab a new version of jquery ui
[00:49:42] <Cork> flam_: or add the migration jqeury plugin
[00:49:57] <Cork> that adds back the $.browser object
[00:50:26] <Cork> mooncup: this channel is users helping users
[00:50:38] <Cork> mooncup: just ask if someone knows they might answer
[00:50:42] <mooncup> fairy nuff
[00:50:48] <Cork> if the plugin has there own support outlet
[00:50:56] <Cork> you could try asking there if noone answers
[00:51:03] <mooncup> I'm using the ajxupload plugin http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#getting-started
[00:51:14] <mooncup> basically I'm submitting a form via ajax
[00:51:19] <mooncup> and it returns a csv file to be downloaded by the user
[00:51:30] <mooncup> how do I offer the return as a download?
[00:51:37] <Cork> ah
[00:51:45] <Cork> that doens't have much to do with the plugin
[00:51:52] <mooncup> well I guess not
[00:51:54] <Cork> mooncup: ajax can't trigger a download dialog
[00:52:04] <mooncup> but some channels are quite picky about what they support
[00:52:13] <mooncup> oh that's a shame
[00:52:15] <Cork> you either have to do a normal full page get call (window.open?)
[00:52:26] <Cork> or you could download the csv file as text
[00:52:29] <mooncup> hm is there a way to force it to pen in a new window?
[00:52:33] <Cork> create a blob file in js
[00:52:36] <mooncup> the server is sending out download headers anyway
[00:52:38] <Cork> and attach it to a download link
[00:52:50] <mooncup> so if I can just open it in a new window the browser should trigger a download
[00:52:55] <Cork> <a download href="<blob">click here</a>
[00:53:13] <mooncup> that makes it 2 button presses to download it though :/
[00:53:19] <Cork> mooncup: open a new window instead of the ajax call ya
[00:53:30] <Cork> mooncup: it is two different options
[00:53:35] <Cork> but those are the options you have
[00:53:40] <mooncup> ok fair enough
[00:53:51] <mooncup> so can I pass a parameter into $.ajax to have it open in a new window?
[00:53:55] <Cork> no
[00:54:00] <mooncup> :<
[00:54:09] <Cork> you could create a small <form>
[00:54:15] <mooncup> well the form already exists
[00:54:19] <Cork> and have it do target="_new"
[00:54:30] <Cork> mooncup: then just don't use js at all
[00:54:31] <mooncup> hmm ok slightly different question then
[00:54:32] <Cork> and it should work
[00:54:47] <Cork> opps target="_blank" not _new :x
[00:54:56] <mooncup> can I append data to the form then submit it?
[00:55:05] <Cork> mooncup: create hidden fields
[00:55:06] <mooncup> I was adding a hidden field, but I want something a bit less permenant
[00:55:11] <mooncup> oh
[00:55:16] <mooncup> I guess not then
[00:55:19] <Cork> :)
[00:55:20] <mooncup> ok thanks for the help
[00:55:22] <Vivekananda_y510> another question. I am trying to debug jquery expressions in chrome. Is there a option there that I can use to see the values of a variable change in the debugging. How do I do that
[00:55:26] <mooncup> I'll keep playing
[00:55:38] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: add a breakpoint?
[00:56:41] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I added a breakpoint and the execution stops there. But the menu on the right is very complicated and I want to understand where in there can I look at variable values
[00:57:12] <mooncup> the easiest way I think would be to output them to the console while you're paused
[01:02:37] <mooncup> hmm so is it possible to generate a url from a GET form?
[01:02:52] <mooncup> if I can do that I can redirect them to the file instead of ajaxing it and the browser wil lforce it
[01:03:32] <Cork> mooncup: just use target="_blank" in the form element
[01:03:48] <Cork> mooncup: when the user click the submit button a new tab will open
[01:03:57] <mooncup> but then I have to modify the form
[01:04:00] <mooncup> which I want to avoid using
[01:04:00] <Cork> yes
[01:04:04] <mooncup> *doing
[01:04:11] <Cork> then you can't use this solution
[01:04:12] <mooncup> ooh it looks like serialize may do what I want
[01:04:15] <mooncup> I shall play around
[01:04:35] <Cork> mooncup: why are you so scared to modify the form?
[01:05:25] <mooncup> because I need to add a parameter to tell the server to generate a csv
[01:05:32] <Cork> ok?
[01:05:32] <mooncup> but then the form still needs to be usable for non-csv
[01:05:37] <mooncup> so I'd have to add and remove the field
[01:05:39] <mooncup> which seems silly
[01:05:41] <Cork> so on submit add the field
[01:06:00] <mooncup> but if serialise does the job then there's no need to do that
[01:06:00] <Cork> mooncup: well if you do a submit the fields is needed
[01:06:06] <Cork> else the browser doesn't know what to send
[01:06:21] <Cork> mooncup: if you want to upload something you can't use window.open
[01:06:31] <mooncup> I'm not uploading anything
[01:06:33] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, yep that would work but is kind of inverted dont you think ? I mean the chrome devtools would already have values and I just need to find how to find that
[01:06:34] <mooncup> it's just a GET form
[01:06:44] <Cork> mooncup: then why are you using ajaxupload ?!?
[01:07:04] <mooncup> oops did I say ajaxupload?
[01:07:10] <mooncup> really sorrt
[01:07:12] <mooncup> sorry
[01:07:16] <mooncup> meant to type ajaxsubmit
[01:07:20] <Cork> <mooncup> I'm using the ajxupload plugin http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#getting-started
[01:07:24] <mooncup> that explains why this conversation was so difficult >.<
[01:07:27] <mooncup> sorry man
[01:07:34] <mooncup> I just massively overcomplicated this discussion
[01:07:56] <Cork> then yes if you don't need to upload things there is no need to use a form
[01:08:09] <Cork> and you could just use $.param
[01:08:16] <Cork> and add that to the end of the url
[01:08:32] <mooncup> ah perfect
[01:08:34] <mooncup> sorry again
[01:08:41] <mooncup> I made life so much more difficult than it needed to be there
[01:08:45] <Cork> window.open(orgUrl + '?' + $.param(object))
[01:08:51] <mooncup> yeah perfect
[01:11:07] <Vivekananda_y510> is there a way that I can find the stack trace of what function is calling a currently failing function in chrome dev tools
[01:13:51] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#viewing-exception-stack-trace
[01:14:21] <mooncup> that's interesting http://pastie.org/private/qwb9kvk5wfpdpb5b3xing
[01:14:34] <mooncup> oh never mind
[01:14:38] <mooncup> ignore me I just saw what's wrong
[01:14:57] <Cork> ^^
[01:15:26] <Cork> mooncup: btw change $('body') => $(document)
[01:15:37] <Vivekananda_y510> thanks
[01:15:39] <mooncup> ah ok
[01:15:41] <Cork> no need to do the query lookup when you are that close to the root
[01:15:41] <Vivekananda_y510> cork
[01:15:52] <mooncup> would document be quicker then?
[01:16:01] <Cork> nanoseconds possibly :)
[01:16:09] <mooncup> excellent
[01:16:11] <mooncup> every little helps
[01:16:19] <Cork> ...
[01:16:24] <mooncup> hey!
[01:16:32] <mooncup> If I can improve by a nano second like a million times
[01:16:54] <Cork> mooncup: 'body' vs document is mainly code cleanup
[01:17:01] <mooncup> fair enough
[01:17:09] <mooncup> I was using body because I saw it on stackoverflow to be honest
[01:17:10] <Cork> there is much better places to looks for performance ^^
[01:17:22] <mooncup> I understand the difference between the 2, but not why it matters which you use
[01:17:39] <Cork> mooncup: $('body') basically does a document.querySelectorAll('body')
[01:17:54] <Cork> and then loops that and adds an event listener to the one hit
[01:18:08] <Cork> while $(document) just loops and adds the event listener
[01:18:16] <mooncup> ah sweet
[01:18:18] <Cork> so you use much less of jquery
[01:18:32] <Cork> but it shouldn't be much speed difference
[01:18:34] <mooncup> well I've made a correction but I'm still getting some weirdness
[01:18:36] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/6zfrhcq7sb0ip3xtmkl4sa
[01:18:39] <Cork> as browsers optimize body lookup
[01:18:52] <mooncup> I'm being sent to /index.php?orders-report=&csv=1
[01:19:01] <mooncup> orders-report is the value of the var form
[01:19:05] <Cork> mooncup: are you sure you mean .data there?
[01:19:09] <mooncup> so it doesn't appear to be using the selector
[01:19:20] <mooncup> yeah I've got the name of the form in a data field
[01:19:33] <Cork> mooncup: and no that isn't how $.param is meant to be used
[01:19:54] <mooncup> oh it has to be an array?
[01:19:55] <mooncup> I misread
[01:20:09] <mooncup> so do I just serialize the form then use param?
[01:20:14] <Cork> var data = $('#'+form).serializeArray(); data.push({name: 'csv', value: type});
[01:20:19] <Cork> and then $.param(data)
[01:20:28] <Cork> $.param expects an object or an array
[01:20:30] <mooncup> you're a beauty
[01:20:32] <mooncup> thanks Cork
[01:20:33] <Cork> not a jquery selection set
[01:21:32] <mooncup> It always takes me so long to do the simplest things with jquery/js
[01:21:37] <Cork> also i would prob replace the if case with value: type + 0
[01:21:37] <mooncup> I'm more of a backend kinda guy
[01:21:49] <Cork> or just value: +type
[01:21:50] <sammych1> node.js ;)
[01:21:56] <mooncup> what does that do?
[01:22:05] <Cork> js> var a = true; print(+a)
[01:22:11] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[01:22:12] <Cork> js> var a = false; print(+a)
[01:22:17] <b-ot> Cork: 0
[01:22:20] <mooncup> what I'm trying to do is use a value of one if there is no data field
[01:22:25] <sammych1> server js
[01:22:39] <mooncup> I was talking to cork
[01:22:41] <mooncup> I know what node is
[01:22:42] <mdev> if I <i class="icon-test"></i><input type="text" name="user" id="user" placeholder="User">
[01:22:52] <mdev> how can I access user's I class prior
[01:23:00] <mdev> or do I need to add an id to the i class
[01:23:00] <mooncup> it's working
[01:23:03] <mooncup> fantastic
[01:23:05] <mooncup> thanks Cork
[01:23:07] <Cork> np :)
[01:23:43] <sammych1> gotcha
[01:24:09] <Cork> mdev: $(this).prevAll('l').first().attr('class')
[01:24:14] <Cork> opps
[01:24:17] <Cork> mdev: $(this).prevAll('i').first().attr('class')
[01:24:41] <mdev> neat i'll try that thanks
[01:24:45] <mdev> you're super clever btw
[01:25:58] <mooncup> what does .data return if there is no data attribute?
[01:26:01] <mooncup> null or undefined?
[01:26:06] <Cork> undefined
[01:26:12] <mooncup> ok
[01:26:18] <mooncup> thanks
[01:26:24] <Cork> though null and undefined is basically the same ting in js
[01:26:30] <Cork> unless you use === or !===
[01:26:38] <mooncup> fair enough
[01:27:32] <Cork> mooncup: if you have data-type="1" or data-type is missing
[01:27:50] <Cork> you could do me.data('type') || 0
[01:27:56] <Cork> or  me.data('type') || 1
[01:28:01] <Cork> depending on what effect you want
[01:28:21] <mooncup> ooh that second one looks ideal
[01:28:32] <mooncup> basically some csv buttons need to send additional data in the csv param
[01:28:39] <mooncup> but others just send a 1 to say it's a csv
[01:28:40] <Cork> js> var a = {}; print(a.type || 1)
[01:28:45] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[01:28:51] <mooncup> ah perfect
[01:28:53] <Cork> js> var a = { type: "hi"}; print(a.type || 1)
[01:28:58] <b-ot> Cork: hi
[01:29:18] <Cork> that is basically how you do default values in js :)
[01:29:49] <sammych1> js> print("print('hi')")
[01:29:54] <b-ot> sammych1: print('hi')
[01:30:03] <sammych1> hmm
[01:30:21] <Cork> try to abuse the bot huh? :D
[01:30:21] <sammych1> it's clearly smart enough not to read itself
[01:30:41] <Cork> samhuntl_: it says sammych1: not js>
[01:30:50] <sammych1> oh yrh
[01:31:07] <Cork> but please don't break the bot
[01:31:14] <Cork> i'm not sure if it handles it or not...
[01:31:31] <sammych1> well, I don't think that has any danger
[01:31:49] <Cork> i'm not willing to risk it
[01:31:54] <sammych1> unless I change my name to js>
[01:32:01] <sammych1> even then it won't work
[01:32:04] <Cork> cause if it ended up in a loop
[01:32:10] <Cork> we would have to hunt for an op
[01:32:25] <sammych1> well, I just wanted to know if it would do it twice
[01:32:36] <sammych1> it's not recursive
[01:32:42] <sammych1> not yet...
[01:32:42] <Cork> well it would be resursive
[01:32:55] <Cork> oh, wait no it wouldn't
[01:33:01] <sammych1> ;)
[01:33:30] <Cork> someone uses setInterval(function() { print("something") }, 80) in javascript
[01:33:32] <Cork> way back
[01:33:40] <Cork> and it ... was horrible...
[01:33:46] <sammych1> I've had this discussion
[01:33:48] <Cork> uses==used
[01:33:53] <sammych1> isn't there a guard in there for that?
[01:33:58] <Cork> now days it is
[01:34:02] <Cork> but there wasn't
[01:34:12] <Cork> after a few minutes they had to kick the bot
[01:34:18] <sammych1> hah
[01:34:30] <Cork> so for a few hours there was no bot at all
[01:34:35] <sammych1> should've just redefined print
[01:34:37] <Cork> until they restarted it
[01:34:48] <Cork> heh
[01:35:02] <Cork> as the env is new every time, that should be safe
[01:35:25] <sammych1> clearTimeout(i++), in a loop
[01:38:55] <rindolf> Hi all. Why does the expander plugin not display anything in div.collapse here in Firefox - http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/humour/ ?
[01:39:10] <rindolf> It works fine in konqueror.
[01:40:24] <Cork> rindolf: where is the expander?
[01:40:29] <Cork> the left menu?
[01:41:04] <rindolf> Cork: no, under http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/humour/#large-scale
[01:41:26] <rindolf> It doesn't wrotk in opera, either
[01:41:27] <larsemil> if i have a set of elements, i want to search them for content no matther how many children deep. how would i do this?
[01:41:36] <larsemil> -h
[01:41:43] <mdev> $(this).prevAll('i').first() for that how can i get the second one up
[01:41:46] <mdev> the first works great
[01:41:51] <Cork> larsemil: .find()
[01:41:53] <sammych1> wait. this is really wrong
[01:42:04] <sammych1> I'm defining functions into the object
[01:42:07] <Cork> mdev: .eq(1)
[01:42:12] <mdev> thanks!
[01:42:14] <sammych1> when they should be in the prototype
[01:42:17] <larsemil> Cork: sorry. text search. :)
[01:42:36] <Cork> larsemil: the dom isn't really built for text search
[01:42:45] <Cork> you would have to convert the dom to text
[01:42:53] <Cork> .text() is prob the simplest option
[01:42:57] <Cork> as it removes the html tags
[01:43:21] <Cork> rindolf: or chrome
[01:43:35] <Cork> rindolf: and i don't have konqueror so donno what you're looking at
[01:44:01] <rindolf> Cork: OK.
[01:44:09] <sammych1> you should compel the user to hit ctrl-f, then compel them to type into the search field
[01:46:55] <sammych1> now I have to refactor my thing
[01:48:05] <sammych1> it should be
[01:48:06] <sammych1> function MyObject() { this.prototype = Object.create(super) }
[01:48:08] <sammych1> right?
[01:57:10] <rindolf> Cork: the problem appears to be the fact that it is application/xml+xhtml
[01:57:54] <Cork> rindolf: the doctype doesn't really matter
[01:58:03] <rindolf> Cork: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/#large-scale - it seems fine here now.
[01:58:04] <Cork> that just affect the parser
[01:59:39] <mbuf> I have a list of check boxes with name="hidden_choice_{n}", where n is from 1 to n. How can I iterate through these check boxes and retrieve the value of checked in them?
[01:59:48] <mbuf> I am using coffeescript
[02:00:30] <Cork> mbuf: give them a class
[02:00:41] <Cork> class="hidden_choice"
[02:00:59] <Cork> then you do $('.hidden_choice:checked')
[02:01:17] <Cork> or $('.hidden_choice').serializeArray()
[02:09:18] <mbuf> Cork, actually they are inside a table, https://gist.github.com/shakthimaan/f343605d30bde8c4acb6
[02:09:36] <mbuf> Cork, so, should the table class be given a name?
[02:09:55] <Cork> you could do $('.foo input')
[02:10:04] <Cork> if that is specific enough for you
[02:14:13] <mbuf> Cork, nice. That gives me the entire node details
[02:14:59] <Cork> mbuf: and again if you just want the checked ones
[02:15:03] <Cork> use .serializeArray()
[02:15:11] <Cork> or :checked
[02:18:33] <svetlana> http://jsfiddle.net/5AdgE/ how do I iterate this data type, and what is it called?
[02:22:22] <Cork> svetlana: http://jsfiddle.net/5AdgE/1/
[02:23:44] <svetlana> Cork, OK. What is the name of that data type? 'Dict' in another language, but I think not in JavaScript.
[02:24:07] <Cork> svetlana: its an object
[02:24:08] <Limarson> svetlana: It's an Object with JSON-Notation
[02:24:18] <Cork> Limarson: no
[02:24:22] <Cork> json is "" not ''
[02:24:26] <Cork> its just a plain object
[02:24:36] <svetlana> I see. Thanks. :)
[02:24:42] <rindolf> svetlana: meow.
[02:24:44] <rindolf> svetlana: sup?
[02:25:04] <Limarson> Cork: damn :D
[02:25:37] <svetlana> rindolf: hi. I'm still working on things within the restricted environment a "wiki" provides. — recently found they also provide jquery, so I'm having another go at some tools people need.
[02:26:15] <rindolf> svetlana: ah.
[02:26:28] <rindolf> svetlana: do you mean the wikimedia sites?
[02:26:37] <svetlana> I do.
[02:27:10] <Limarson> I'm currently filtering a json-object via $.grep(), is it possible to make some kind of "distinct" filter with it?
[02:28:58] <Cork> Limarson: no if you want to filter objects you need to use a function
[02:29:12] <Cork> Limarson: you could make a default set of filter functions though
[02:29:38] <Cork> and do $.grep(obj, my_specific_filter_function_that_do_neet_stuff);
[02:30:33] <Limarson> Mhm k, thank you
[02:33:05] <mbuf> Cork, the '$(.foo :checked).serializeArray() retrieves the entries for those that have been checked. Is it the default behaviour? or, can we simply get all the values?
[02:33:29] <Cork> mbuf: you said you wanted the checked ones :)
[02:33:36] <Cork> use .foo input if you want them all
[02:34:14] <svetlana> http://jsfiddle.net/5AdgE/2/ .prop('label') doesn't work on an input radio type. .prop('id','...') works. As it doesn't give me an error, I'm not sure where to head.
[02:34:26] <mbuf> Cork, okay
[02:34:49] <Cork> svetlana: label isn't a property on inputs
[02:34:58] <Cork> svetlana: label is a separate tag
[02:36:19] <Cork> svetlana: http://jsfiddle.net/5AdgE/4/
[02:37:36] <svetlana> I see. I realised I was looking at an XUL guide by mistake. Thanks
[02:39:16] <mooncup> an element seems to be losing an id when I select it with parent()
[02:39:17] <mooncup> it's very odd
[02:39:19] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/9ootqlwhz2uniinqoqtyq
[02:39:30] <mooncup> both of those are the same element selected in different ways
[02:39:39] <mooncup> but if you look, one has an id and one doesn't
[02:39:44] <garrilla> hi.. I have a form with a single input - i'm try to handle for: click event on a button in the form, keypress 13 or blur/focusout -- but clicking the button triggers a click event and the focusout event... how to prevent?
[02:39:49] <Cork> mooncup: most likely cause you have multiple elements with the same id
[02:40:16] <mooncup> ah can that cause that?
[02:40:23] <Cork> the id would be invalid
[02:40:43] <Cork> only one element in the page is allowed to use any given id in the page
[02:40:50] <Cork> if you need multiple use class
[02:41:08] <garrilla> or name
[02:41:17] <Cork> name isn't valid on <div>
[02:41:31] <garrilla> true
[02:45:36] <Vivekananda_y510> viveka
[02:46:54] <mooncup> thanks Cork
[02:47:08] <mooncup> not sure if that was actually the cause, since I don't actually think there were multiple elements with that id
[02:47:12] <mooncup> but I managed to fix it at any rate
[02:47:42] <Cork> mooncup: its quite simple do $('[id="the-id"]').length > 1
[02:47:51] <Cork> if you ever feel you need to know
[02:47:58] <Cork> if that is true you have an invalid id
[02:48:29] <Utils> Hello. I'm trying to detect if I'm scrolled to the bottom of a div, and right now I'm getting no console output which suggests the scroll event isn't being listened to: http://jsfiddle.net/5BPS8/ any ideas what I did wrong?
[02:48:54] <Cork> Utils: the div doesn't have overflow
[02:48:59] <Cork> so ya, you don't get any events
[02:49:21] <mooncup> tis returning false
[02:49:27] <mooncup> that's a very useful snippet
[02:49:42] <Utils> overflow has to be set instead of overflow-y ?
[02:50:18] <Utils> and it's not returning false, well it might be but even a console output that isn't a false value will not show up.
[02:50:54] <Utils> oh... um.
[02:51:24] <Utils> it was working. my window was small so the scrollbar i thought was the divs, wasn't.
[02:55:26] <Cork> Utils: http://jsfiddle.net/5BPS8/2/
[02:55:44] <Cork> also, alway, alywas, always ALWAYS define your variables
[02:57:50] <Vivekananda_y510> I am trying to figure out why a some get requests are there in my duplicated code when they are not in the original Can someone help a bit. The original code runs here : http://192.241.236.31/themes/preview/smartadmin/1.4.1/ajaxversion/#ajax/dashboard.html      .  my code is here :    http://localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html .    The get line that I see in the dev tools is :    GET http:/
[02:57:50] <Vivekananda_y510> /localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/js/plugin/flot/jquery.flot.cust.min.html 404 (Not Found)     but in the original  it looks for a .js page not a  .html
[02:58:49] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: not much we can do without seeing the page in action
[02:59:17] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, you can see the page in action both the original and my version on the links above
[02:59:38] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: no, i can't access your localhost; sorry...
[02:59:46] <Vivekananda_y510> I am using localtunnel to show my page and also the original
[02:59:54] <Vivekananda_y510> you mean the link does not work ?
[03:00:00] <Cork> its localhost...
[03:00:10] <Vivekananda_y510> oo  one sec sorry wrong link
[03:01:48] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, my localhost is https://756703c1.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html
[03:01:56] <Vivekananda_y510> that should work
[03:02:48] <Cork> no html call here
[03:03:14] <Vivekananda_y510> if you load that page do you see some console get errors on the chrome dev tools
[03:03:33] <Cork> i see syntax errors
[03:05:25] <Vivekananda_y510> do you see this :  http://imgur.com/TNhhVep ?
[03:05:43] <Vivekananda_y510> the errors on the bottom I mean ?
[03:05:49] <Cork> no
[03:05:49] <Utils> Cork that one doesn't appear to work, and the scroll isn't dependent on the window as it's a div within a bunch of divs and it's all positioned to look like a chat. http://jsfiddle.net/5BPS8/5/ this one appears to work  from what i see, however the same code doesn't work on my site... it's true if there is no scrollbar, and as soon as there is.. it's always false.
[03:06:11] <Cork> Utils: then your demo wasn't complete
[03:06:19] <Cork> you need to have the elements that matter for your code
[03:07:18] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, so if you run the link I gave you what do you see ? It is surprising ie how can the reload show different things to different people
[03:08:44] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string jquery-ui.min.js:2084 | Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function VM123:55
[03:09:13] <Cork> and a long list of mime type complaints cause you load .html as images
[03:09:24] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: sounds like you have a confused server or something
[03:10:31] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, that is tougher to debug than what I initially thought. what is your browser
[03:10:36] <Vivekananda_y510> also how do I rectify this
[03:10:44] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: that was from chrome
[03:11:21] <Vivekananda_y510> I have crome on windows 8 too . lemme try that linkn I gave you and see what is visible to me
[03:11:32] <Cork> ff gives me errors from jquery-ui.min.js
[03:11:53] <Cork> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[03:12:49] <Utils> hmm... i do. although for some reason it's 1px off. idk why.
[03:12:58] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, here is what I see in my chrome http://imgur.com/078jX45
[03:13:46] <mooncup> oh wow Vivekananda_y510
[03:13:53] <mooncup> I'm using the same template
[03:13:53] <mooncup> haha
[03:13:58] <mooncup> small world
[03:13:59] <Raydiation> hi, does jquery offer something like q.all() ?
[03:14:09] <Raydiation> like wait until all get requests are done
[03:14:11] <Cork> Raydiation: q.all??
[03:14:21] <Cork> Raydiation: $.when
[03:14:30] <Raydiation> ty
[03:15:22] <Cork> Raydiation: so $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax()).done(function() {})
[03:16:03] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I am trying to learn from the template but replicating parts of it and then coding myself
[03:16:19] <mooncup> I've just hacked it to pieces :D
[03:16:26] <Vivekananda_y510> I am getthing the errors I posted for cork .  but I am getting nowhere
[03:16:26] <Raydiation> Cork: exactly :)
[03:16:28] <Raydiation> thanks
[03:16:33] <mooncup> It looks pretty but there are lots of problems with it
[03:16:41] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, ooo nice then help me please
[03:16:45] <mooncup> it uses an old version of a few bits
[03:16:46] <Vivekananda_y510> I am trying to do the same
[03:16:52] <mooncup> ok so what's the current issue?
[03:16:58] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, you are the man :)
[03:17:56] <Vivekananda_y510> I need to hack it. I am currently intent on downloading it and running it locally and then begin hacking but having no success running it locally. To complicate matters a tiny bit more I am not just apache but drupal installed too
[03:18:21] <mooncup> well judging by that screenshot you didn't download some of hte files
[03:18:23] <Vivekananda_y510> I just called the indexpage in the demo from a drupal basic page
[03:18:38] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I was guessing so too but hold on
[03:19:21] <mooncup> I may be back and forth
[03:19:23] <mooncup> cuz I'm at work
[03:19:27] <mooncup> but I'll help as much as I can
[03:19:52] <Vivekananda_y510> The original code runs here : http://192.241.236.31/themes/preview/smartadmin/1.4.1/ajaxversion/#ajax/dashboard.html      .  my code is here :    https://756703c1.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html
[03:20:02] <Vivekananda_y510> thats great
[03:20:17] <Vivekananda_y510> good enough I mean
[03:20:39] <Vivekananda_y510> could you run my code ( it is a localtunnel) and tellme what is up with it ?
[03:21:08] <Vivekananda_y510> I used winhttptrac to download the demo dashboard
[03:21:28] <gavit> http://jsfiddle.net/QLrtN/ <- is there a way to change the updateSum function to not "need" the attribute? I'll obviously add more rows with purchase_order[order_lines_attributes][1][price] etc obviously
[03:21:56] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, okay to pm ? I dont want to bug everyone less someone gets annoyed
[03:22:43] <mooncup> here would be better
[03:23:48] <mooncup> ok Vivekananda_y510
[03:23:51] <mooncup> google for and download
[03:23:54] <mooncup> jquery flot
[03:23:58] <mooncup> jquery fullcalendar
[03:24:02] <mooncup> and jquery jvectormap
[03:24:07] <mooncup> then embed them
[03:25:19] <mooncup> oh wait
[03:25:29] <mooncup> I have a zipped copy of pretty much all the files you need if you want to use that
[03:25:34] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, before I do that I have questions 1. When you run the tunneled page at your end do you see the same errors I see ?  Cork was not seeing the same errors I saw
[03:25:41] <mooncup> it's missing a little bit, but maybe less than what you have
[03:25:54] <mooncup> I was seeing a few 404s
[03:26:06] <Cork> heh... interesting
[03:26:07] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, sure btw how am I missing much ? I used winhttptrac for download of the site
[03:26:17] <mooncup> not sure
[03:26:36] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, if you look at the screenshot I posted above do you see those very errors too ?
[03:27:19] <mooncup> yes I do
[03:29:24] <Vivekananda_y510> then how is Cork's output different and why I wonder but anyways moving on
[03:30:34] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: opened the page again
[03:30:40] <Cork> and this time i got those 404
[03:30:47] <Cork> after the errors i saw before
[03:31:01] <Cork> so that mystery seams to be solved
[03:31:18] <Vivekananda_y510> 2. when I load the original page and search for similar file name loaded ( similar to the ones failing on mine) I see that the ones loaded there have an ending .js instead of .html . eg  jquery.fullcalendar.min.js  and not jquery.fullcalendar.min.html.  why i sthis happening
[03:31:45] <Vivekananda_y510> Cork, so my server IS wobbly then is it ?
[03:32:03] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, 2 ^^
[03:32:04] <Cork> Vivekananda_y510: not sure might have been something else
[03:32:17] <mooncup> I think that's to do with the way that site displays its templates
[03:32:42] <mooncup> what I did was take out the calls to the .html pages and just replace them with the actual libraries
[03:33:29] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, could you elaborate a bit ? doesnt the code decide what paget to 'get' or look for . How can the same code look for two different files ?
[03:33:58] <mooncup> well you can include files in other files
[03:34:06] <mooncup> so you need to find where those files are being included and delete it
[03:34:25] <mooncup> then replace it with <script src='flot.js'>
[03:34:30] <mooncup> where flot.js is a full path to the library
[03:34:35] <Vivekananda_y510> sorry to bug also but I am not very well versed in jquery stuff though I have done a little but trying to backtrace to the html calls has been giving me grief for more than 5 days now :(
[03:34:39] <mooncup> most of them are on cdns but I'd recommend you get it yourself
[03:34:53] <Vivekananda_y510> what is cdns ?
[03:35:00] <mooncup> content delivery network or osmething similar
[03:35:05] <mooncup> they're sites that host code for you
[03:35:10] <mooncup> so you can just include it
[03:36:09] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, so you mean I search my codebase for occurence of the regex like jquery.fullcalendar.min.html and replace it with .js  ?
[03:36:34] <mooncup> well search for it and delete it
[03:36:54] <mooncup> then google fullcalendar and grab their code for embedding it
[03:37:10] <mooncup>  //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.0.2/fullcalendar.min.js
[03:37:25] <mooncup> so that would be <script src='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.0.2/fullcalendar.min.js'></script>
[03:41:34] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, currently I see that 'jquery.fullcalendar.min.html'  is on line 507 here : https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/b661aef3463dae899f80   . so on replacing the loadscript function argument 1 with .js instead of html should work right ?
[03:45:42] <mooncup> exactly
[03:46:16] <mooncup> wait
[03:46:31] <mooncup> no you need to replace it with //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.0.2/fullcalendar.min.js
[03:50:29] <mooncup> ok lunch time
[03:50:32] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, currently I found the fullcalendar.min.js file from the original
[03:50:34] <Vivekananda_y510> okay
[03:50:48] <Vivekananda_y510> I am trying that and if it doesnt work I will go with your advice to replace the big one
[03:50:49] <mooncup> you can use it if you want
[03:50:51] <mooncup> but it's out of date
[03:51:00] <mooncup> I found out it was an old version of fullcalendar
[03:51:05] <mooncup> but if that doesn't matter to you then go for it
[03:51:09] <mooncup> anyway back in a bit
[03:51:21] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, no worries :) one step at a time. It has taken me 5 days for no reason :(
[03:51:23] <Vivekananda_y510> sure
[04:14:10] <mbuf> is there a way to retrieve the sent parameter from an AJAX call after it has returned in success?
[04:15:30] <Cork> mbuf: you would have to do that yourself
[04:19:14] <mbuf> Cork, I want to be able to do this in the success section, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b4fec995a3229aad6928
[04:19:41] <mbuf> Cork, use the value of choice after the AJAX call has returned
[04:20:06] <Cork> mbuf: you could set context in the ajax call
[04:20:19] <Cork> and do something like this.choice in the callback
[04:20:36] <Cork> mbuf: or you could just reference choice directly like you are right now
[04:20:53] <Cork> mbuf: sidenote, don't use return false
[04:21:05] <Cork> if you ever want to bind an additional event handler this will break that code
[04:21:13] <Cork> use event.preventDefault() instead
[04:22:44] <mbuf> Cork, if I do console.log( this.choice), I get undefined
[04:22:57] <Cork> mbuf: no your missing what i meant
[04:23:06] <Cork> what your doing there right now should work
[04:23:13] <Cork> as choice is in the same scope chain
[04:23:34] <Cork> alternatively you could have $.ajax pass it along with context:
[04:23:38] <Cork> but normally you shouldn't need to
[04:23:57] <mbuf> Cork, yes, it works; thanks!

[04:59:29] <amcsi_work> hi
[04:59:37] <MikeD_> hi
[04:59:41] <amcsi_work> what is the trendy templating plugin for jquery nowadays?
[05:01:51] <mooncup> bootstrap?
[05:03:00] <Cork> bootstrap, underscore, and jqote2 is the tree i see the most
[05:03:18] <Cork> jqote2 is nice if you just need a template engine and nothing else

[05:36:42] <droid909> guys is it ok to have json object to be represented like first the list of values as an array and then the same values but with titles
[05:37:50] <terkel_> join #mssql
[05:38:16] <droid909> i.e. i sent an object like this {[id:1,name:'anme']} and it looks like:    1:1, 2:anme,id:1, name:'anme"
[05:38:31] <droid909> when i do console.dir
[05:38:41] <droid909> when i do console.dir(my_json);
[05:41:15] <droid909>  i sent an object like this {[id:1,name:'anme']} and it looks like:    1:1, 2:anme,id:1, name:'anme"
[05:41:19] <droid909> why?
[05:52:00] <vyadhaka> if I add a listener to an element, isn't it supposed to run the function only when the event occurs, eg. $(".tabs a:nth-child(2)").on("click", tab_effects(2)); I set these up for nth-child(1) and 3 as well, looks like these are executing even when the event does not occur, what am i doing wrong

[06:09:17] <svetlana> sespiros: check if the element is still defined
[06:09:42] <NCS_One> since this: "$(selector).first(function() {...});"   doesn't work how do I execute a function on the first element? "$(selector).first().each(function() {...});"?
[06:12:26] <NCS_One> it works but is it ok?
[06:16:03] <sespiros> svetlana: how do I do this? i suspect it has to do with the context but i dont know what else to do apart from delegating the event to the document

[06:36:45] <Hausas> uhm#
[06:39:35] <Hausas> $('#editor').width(); returns 0 for me
[06:39:41] <Hausas> even though it is there
[06:39:49] <Hausas> ~150 px wide
[06:41:02] <Hausas> and $('#editor').position().left; returns 32, when it's 290 px left of the screen
[06:45:14] <BillCriswell> Hausas: How about .offset().left ?
[07:08:51] <zatan> hey I have got two arrays for example foo = ['boom', 'doom']  and bar = ['mia', 'zia'] how can I make this as dictionary for example new_dict = {'boom': 'mia', 'doom': 'zia'} ?
[07:08:54] <Sal> hi
[07:09:41] <Sal> does anyone know of problem on show() hide() on iphone 5?
[07:10:26] <Sal> i got a display:none set div and i display it with show()
[07:10:48] <Sal> works on chrome, ff and safari itab imac but not iphone 5
[07:10:50] <Sal> any idea?
[07:11:17] <decx> zatan with a simple loop
[07:11:31] <decx> new_dict[foo[i]] = bar[i]
[07:11:40] <Hausas> BillCriswell: I'd try that now but I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ; jquery-2.0.3.js:545
[07:11:44] <Hausas> :-[
[07:11:53] <Hausas> And all my js seems fine
[07:11:59] <BillCriswell> Using .offset().left wouldn't cause that error.
[07:12:06] <Hausas> I know
[07:12:15] <Hausas> I haven't tried it yet
[07:13:06] <zatan> decx: worked! :))
[07:16:09] <JustMozzy> uhm... to check if a var is undefined I just do myvar == 'undefined' right?
[07:16:42] <decx> !myvar should work too in most cases
[07:16:50] <prtksxna> JustMozzy: typeof myvar === 'undefined'
[07:17:04] <decx> right, typeof
[07:17:28] <JustMozzy> prtksxna: thanks... forgot about that one hehe
[07:18:08] <prtksxna> (y)
[07:27:59] <damasceno> Hello. Does anyone know how I can use FPDF to generate a PDF and return the result to Jquery? This is my code: http://pastebin.com/RG8xG5dN It works but it's saving the PDF and I don't need to save it.
[07:34:23] <BillCriswell> damasceno: Yesterday I read showing the PDF in an iframe should work... I Thi
[07:34:26] <BillCriswell> I think*
[07:34:43] <mooncup> damasceno: instead of $pdf->Output('../Atestado/example1.pdf','F');
[07:34:56] <mooncup> try $pdf->Output('../Atestado/example1.pdf','I');
[07:35:23] <MikeD_> is .resizable() in jquery ui core?
[07:36:12] <MikeD_> nm, i can read.
[07:38:43] <damasceno> mooncup: I tried that but it doesn't work. I need to return something to Jquery via echo, right? What should that be?
[07:40:51] <mooncup> not sure tbh
[07:41:12] <Sal> .show() not working on iphone. any idea?
[07:41:35] <Sal> not using jquery mobile, jusy jquery
[07:41:56] <Sal> y/t
[07:44:09] <wunz> Sal: but works on browser?
[07:44:19] <Sal> yep
[07:44:24] <Sal> no, wait
[07:44:37] <Sal> works on itab safari and imac safari
[07:44:43] <Sal> works on all chrome and all ff
[07:44:53] <Sal> doesn't work on iphione5 safari
[07:45:13] <Sal> wunz, if you have an iphone, i can let you test it
[07:45:23] <Sal> i don't have any iphone, they just told me it
[07:45:25] <wunz> sure
[07:45:53] <Hausas> Found the error.
[07:46:03] <Hausas> Ok, now I've got this thing
[07:46:24] <Sal> wunz, i'm in pvt chat
[07:46:49] <hlvwrk> pvt. sgt. squad leaderz [xX] sniper [Xx]
[07:46:53] <hlvwrk> lol.ol
[07:47:32] <Hausas> I have <input> and whenever it's clicked, I replace it with ace editor. And whenever ace editor is present and the user clicks outside the editor it collapses back to <input>. But I can only do that once. Even though I revert back to the same <input> with the same class name
[07:48:15] <Hausas> I wanna do that multiple times
[07:49:13] <Hausas> The jquery listener isn't listening anymore after the first time
[07:49:46] <Hausas> Anyone know a workaround for this?
[07:49:54] <ses1984> even though it's the same class name, it's not the same element
[07:50:03] <ses1984> you can use delegate()
[07:50:09] <Hausas> but I'm using classes
[07:50:15] <decx> delegate but not with delegate() but on()
[07:50:32] <ses1984> or your code that collapses back to input, reconnect the listener to the new element
[07:50:33] <Hausas> so it shouldn't matter, as the jquery should execute all classes
[07:50:49] <Hausas> Want me to post the code?
[07:50:50] <ses1984> Hausas: "it shouldn't matter" you're assumptions are wrong
[07:50:53] <shoky> Hausas: it does matter, unless you're using delegation.
[07:50:57] <ses1984> i mean, your assumptions
[07:51:02] <Hausas> Oh, sorry
[07:51:09] <Hausas> I'm not senior jquery developer
[07:51:21] <Hausas> And I'm not familiar with delegations
[07:51:21] <ses1984> we're just trying to help no need to get snippy
[07:51:32] <shoky> `api on
[07:51:32] <b-ot> shoky: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:51:32] <Hausas> I'm not trying to be snippy
[07:51:37] <shoky> read about it there ^
[07:51:40] <Hausas> Oh
[07:51:54] <Hausas> instead of using .focus() i should use .on ?
[07:52:00] <Hausas> is that what you are saying?
[07:52:18] <decx> read this http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[07:52:30] <shoky> we were saying use delegation
[07:52:37] <shoky> you can do it with .on yes
[07:52:48] <Hausas> Ok. Thanks a lot

[07:53:04] <Sal> wunz, still there?
[07:55:07] <JustMozzy> crappy firefox. how do I get Event.offsetX in this shitty browser?
[07:55:48] <Hausas> .offset().left
[07:55:53] <Hausas> I suppose
[07:56:38] <JustMozzy> also undefined
[07:56:45] <decx> layerX
[07:56:55] <JustMozzy> undefined
[07:57:11] <decx> var blah = e.offsetX || e.layerX
[07:57:20] <JustMozzy> layerX is undefined
[08:00:53] <JustMozzy> this is weird
[08:04:36] <JustMozzy> I hate firefox. it is the new IE6
[08:05:44] <JustMozzy> layerX is not even listen in the docs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent WTF?!?!
[08:06:14] <hlvwrk> lol?
[08:06:25] <hlvwrk> what's wrong with firefox?
[08:06:30] <hlvwrk> it's so much better than chrome
[08:06:48] <Hausas> I get     Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u   in  editor.setValue(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(textInStatic), null, '\t'));
[08:06:56] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: not at all. it runs slow, doesn't understand css and javascript correctly
[08:07:20] <hlvwrk> no. properly written css and JS, it understands properly.
[08:07:29] <decx> bam
[08:07:31] <hlvwrk> Chrome lets you screw up, and it fixes it silently
[08:07:33] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: hahaha, yeah. in my butt it understands it
[08:07:38] <ses1984> can we not get into a browser war debate here
[08:07:52] <JustMozzy> ses1984: yes we can :)
[08:07:53] <JustMozzy> hehe
[08:07:56] <hlvwrk> no debate. write your code correctly, and stop blaming the browser :)
[08:08:02] <decx> yeah it doesnt make sense, everyone know ff is better >)
[08:08:59] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: then tell me oh wise one :P how do I get offsetX from that browser? do I really have to calcualte it myself? because most other browsers offer that for you
[08:09:32] <hlvwrk> var x = e.offsetX==undefined?e.layerX:e.offsetX; ?
[08:09:36] <hlvwrk> that's hard
[08:09:53] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: yeah... you're wrong
[08:09:57] <hlvwrk> Use pageX.
[08:10:01] <JustMozzy> layerX is not supported by firefox
[08:10:11] <hlvwrk> LayerX isn't supported, but pageX is.
[08:10:26] <ses1984> firefox supports other css that chrome doesn't. they're different. competition is good. jquery supports both.
[08:10:33] <hlvwrk> and layerX is supported actually
[08:10:39] <hlvwrk> offset isn't
[08:11:12] <hlvwrk> it's like... http://jaspreetchahal.org/javascript-offsetx-offsety-firefox-not-working/
[08:11:16] <hlvwrk> there's so many solutions
[08:11:40] <decx> the jquery event is different from native events
[08:11:52] <decx> layerX is in firefoxes native event
[08:11:53] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: pageX is not the same as offsetX. and no layerX is NOT supported. look it up in the docs.
[08:12:09] <hlvwrk> https://www.google.com/search?q=offsetX+in+firefox .. 42,000 results
[08:12:12] <hlvwrk> just saying
[08:12:17] <hlvwrk> there's plenty of workarounds
[08:13:23] <JustMozzy> hlvwrk: why workaround if you can have it from the event itself. that's my point. I could also write a whole f'n browser from scratch but I won't do that. why does ff just do a shitty job in that? ughhh... anyway, I guess I'll have to go in and write extra code just for FF to understand a simple instruction xD
[08:14:35] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rJGdL/
[08:14:56] <hlvwrk> there's just not a lot of cases that firefox lacks simple instruction...
[08:14:58] <hlvwrk> lol
[08:15:12] <hlvwrk> chrome has some pitfalls too, you know. ;P
[08:15:25] <decx> firefox also doesnt understand -webkit- prefixes, what a lame ass browser /s
[08:15:35] <hlvwrk> lol
[08:15:43] <hlvwrk> that sarcasm.
[08:15:47] * hlvwrk feels it
[08:15:51] <ses1984> well chrome doesn't have any pitfalls that's *I've* run into yet, therefore it's the best /s
[08:16:23] <decx> i just love writing all my transition and transform css rules multiple times !
[08:16:52] <Hausas> wtf is this supposed to mean? Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u
[08:16:54] <JustMozzy> decx: you can't compare -webkit prefixes with the simple offsetX/Y properties for a mouse event. all but firefox support it. I'll just write my own browser. with blackjack and hookers hehe
[08:17:23] <Hausas> nvm
[08:17:28] <Hausas> redeclaring variables
[08:17:36] <JustMozzy> decx: sass/less and mixin. but you're right. would be nice if all those browsers would behave. they're all naughty
[08:18:40] <decx> JustMozzy do var myX = e.offsetX || e.pageX-$(this).offset().left
[08:19:35] <decx> now it's going to be offsetX when that works and otherwise calculate fom pageX
[08:19:51] <decx> it's a bit strange that layerX isnt in the jquery event
[08:20:48] <ses1984> you're falling for his trap. all he has to say is "firefox sucks" and you're doing his work for him
[08:21:20] <decx> i'm not a dogmatist, i just want to help
[08:46:31] <erisco> I need to pop up a notification beside an element when an error occurs. Kind of like a quote balloon. Any suggestions?
[08:48:07] <decx> it's called a tooltip
[08:48:11] <erisco> hm this seems decent http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/
[08:48:24] <duch_kazatel> if you want tooltips, check out powertip.
[08:48:43] <erisco> yeah but I specifically need the quote balloon shape and need to position it to the right of the element. this plugin looks like it gives me that
[08:49:38] <duch_kazatel> powertip can do that, but ok :)
[08:49:52] <decx> with a bit of css you can make it look like boobs if you want
[08:53:25] <jParkton> and win
[08:53:40] <jParkton> boobs are good for advertising
[08:56:29] <oste> how does this line of code work https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/carousel.js#L169
[08:56:46] <oste> from what i can tell data is always undefined
[08:56:52] <adv_> can anyone help with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24828404/galleria-fit-image-to-screen-without-imagecrop-option ?
[08:56:59] <oste> b/c of the bs. namespace
[08:57:20] <decx> if (!data) $this.data('bs.carousel', (data = new Carousel(this, options)))
[08:57:28] <decx> 4 lines below
[08:57:38] <oste> yes, but what is the point of the line i showed then?
[08:57:41] <oste> if it is always null
[08:57:46] <decx> it gets data if it's set
[08:57:54] <oste> how do you do that?
[08:58:08] <decx> like this var data = $this.data('bs.carousel')
[08:58:10] <decx> ^^
[08:58:40] <oste> how can data var be anything other than undefine tho?
[08:58:54] <jParkton> adv_: unset that width
[08:58:56] <oste> <div data-carousel=“test”></div>
[08:58:57] <jParkton> it is 1242
[08:59:03] <oste> that will always be undefined
[08:59:07] <decx> if you apply carousel to an element that was already initialized
[08:59:15] <decx> with carousel
[08:59:30] <oste> ah ha
[08:59:58] <decx> it just makes sure not to init when it doesnt need to
[09:00:25] <oste> kinda makes sense
[09:00:26] <oste> thanks
[09:03:31] <adv_> jParkton: hm?
[09:06:37] <Miles8of9> how do i intercept clicks on select options?
[09:06:42] <adv_> jParkton: the width of which element?
[09:07:20] <ngharo> Miles8of9: you don't, instead you want to bind to .change() event
[09:11:01] <jParkton> adv_: of your image
[09:11:32] <adv_> jParkton: how?
[09:11:47] <jParkton> 0.o
[09:11:57] <jParkton> type a different value
[09:12:00] <adv_> i mean i don't have it set in <img>
[09:14:10] <adv_> jParkton: can you please elaborate on how to do this?
[09:14:30] <trevlar> Anybody know a good plugin that, when you type an @ symbol in a textarea, will start to autocomplete a list of possible names?
[09:14:53] <jParkton> http://hastebin.com/ixiwojupod.xml
[09:15:01] <jParkton> adv_: there is the rendered code
[09:15:14] <jParkton> view the source code to find those values and change them
[09:16:22] <adv_> jParkton: how did you get that rendering?
[09:16:56] <jParkton> click the link, Ctrl+U
[09:16:59] <jParkton> view source
[09:17:06] <jParkton> dev tools
[09:17:09] <jParkton> use em
[09:19:14] <adv_> i'm new to webdev, where in dev tools :S
[09:20:21] <duch_kazatel> hit f12
[09:20:45] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all..
[09:20:53] <duch_kazatel> click tabs.  success/
[09:21:26] <adv_> where in the dev tools, not where are the dev tools
[09:21:26] <FrEaKmAn_> is there a way to use draggable/resizable with on()? or anything similar?
[09:21:40] <FrEaKmAn_> so when I update the dom, draggable/resizable still stays or updates
[09:21:44] <duch_kazatel> rendered HTML is usually in the "inspector"
[09:21:57] <duch_kazatel> or "elements" depending on which ones yopu're using.
[09:26:05] <adv_> hm it does it now but i want it to dynamically compute the frame
[09:26:35] <adv_> jParkton: when you zoom in with the mousewheel, it should change the width , how can i do that?
[09:29:17] <decx> there was a plugin for that i found a few centuries ago
[09:29:22] <decx> jquery wheelzoom
[09:35:52] <adv_> decx: this is what i'm using
[09:38:26] <omosoj> hey all i'm new to jquery. can someone point me the right way: i want to be able to drag a block to another block, and if the blocks match for them to disappear
[09:39:51] <adv_> i updated the question with the new findings, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24828404/galleria-fit-image-to-screen-without-imagecrop-option
[09:57:54] <bl4ckdu5t> I guess I don't need the data parameter for ajax posting if it's a get request and required values are in url ?
[09:58:05] <duch_kazatel> pretty much.
[09:58:19] <bl4ckdu5t> ok duch_kazatel thanks
[09:59:13] <duch_kazatel> the docs say "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests." :)
[09:59:56] * bl4ckdu5t notes
[10:19:15] <adv_> is there a jquery plugin that on a push of a button it changes the contents of a listview?
[10:21:33] <BillCriswell> adv_: You wouldn't need a plugin for that. $('button').on('click', function () { $('#list-view').html('new html'); }); would do that.
[10:22:47] <MikeD_> doesn't it depend on what you mean by "changes" ?
[10:23:52] <adv_> i want to change the <li> elements
[10:24:34] <BillCriswell> adv_: Right, so $('ul').html('<li>New li</li>');
[10:24:39] <adv_> thanks
[10:24:40] <BillCriswell> That would replace all lis with that one new li.
[10:33:26] <lintguy> How can i select the select option item with the longest text?
[10:33:57] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:34:00] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[10:34:46] <lintguy> a lot of products with canonial url's in an admin i can't hack in any other way, i need to select the longest on a lot of products so i added jquery and put code into the console.
[10:35:24] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to enumerate through the set to find that.
[10:36:01] <lintguy> using map?
[10:36:46] <duch_kazatel> then you'd have to iterate through the new array.
[10:37:27] <duch_kazatel> you could one-shot it, check the .length of .text() and store a reference.  then, for each item check it's text length against the "current largest" and, if larger, store that element.
[10:37:39] <lintguy> ok, this i know but how to sort out only the single one that is longest?
[10:37:59] <duch_kazatel> i just explained it.
[10:38:02] <duch_kazatel> there's no magic selector.
[10:38:12] <Miles8of9> $(this).bind("change", function (event) { console.log( event.????);});  <--- text? source? getText()? wtf?
[10:38:25] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 huh?
[10:38:51] <duch_kazatel> lintguy enumerate over each one, compare that text with the current max size.  if larger, store that reference and move to the next.
[10:38:53] <Miles8of9> i want to intercept the selected value of a select
[10:39:16] <lintguy> how do i store a reference?
[10:39:17] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Miles8of9
[10:39:18] <b-ot> Miles8of9: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:39:54] <BillCriswell> lintguy: var $foo = $('.foo'); ?
[10:40:03] <duch_kazatel> by creating a variable above the scope of the each and then setting that to $(this) inside.
[10:40:35] <lintguy> Hm, ok
[10:40:36] <lintguy> i'll try
[10:40:59] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/4xBJk/5/
[10:41:50] <Miles8of9> the evenmt should contain the slected value
[10:42:45] <Miles8of9> $(this).value gives nothing...
[10:42:52] <duch_kazatel> you want .val()
[10:42:59] <duch_kazatel> but i haven't looked at your fiddle yet.
[10:43:02] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[10:43:15] <decx> this.value
[10:43:20] <Miles8of9> right
[10:43:25] <duch_kazatel> or use this.value, not $(this).valuie
[10:43:27] <duch_kazatel> *value
[10:43:36] <decx> you also don't need to attach inside the each, you can chain it after
[10:44:20] <duch_kazatel> lintguy http://jsfiddle.net/Ma8jw/
[10:44:27] <duch_kazatel> this is dirty but gives you the idea.
[10:44:43] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 don't use .bind().
[10:44:44] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[10:45:14] <Miles8of9> ah ok
[10:45:16] <Alina-malina> $(this).val()   i need the keyCode and not the value how to do that?
[10:45:28] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina look at the event object.
[10:45:41] <Alina-malina> :-/
[10:45:52] <adv_> in jquery-mobile i have <button class="ui-btn ui-btn-inline" style="width=100px;">Button 1</button>
[10:45:52] <adv_>  but it still takes the whole page width
[10:45:55] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina simple google search.
[10:45:57] <adv_> why?
[10:46:00] <Alina-malina> just a moment
[10:47:40] <Miles8of9> books say use bind... why? is it old code?
[10:47:46] <duch_kazatel> that's way old.
[10:47:54] <duch_kazatel> what book did you get?
[10:48:02] <Miles8of9> jquery novice to ninja
[10:48:04] <Miles8of9> lol
[10:48:30] <simsketch_> bind should now be .on or .live?
[10:48:39] <duch_kazatel> the last version of that book was written for 1.6, Miles8of9
[10:48:41] <duch_kazatel> we're on 1.12
[10:48:45] <duch_kazatel> simsketch_ .on()
[10:48:58] <duch_kazatel> .live(), .bind(), and .delegate() are all deprecated for .on().
[10:48:59] <lintguy> duch_kazatel: Thanks, your solution was really neat
[10:49:05] <lintguy> duch_kazatel: i overcomplicate things... http://pastebin.com/FQEaYkt4
[10:49:16] * Velveeta_ puts on a Godzirra suit and stomps his way through the room, knocking people over!
[10:49:22] <lintguy> duch_kazatel: i managed to sort the longest one, but missed the selector :P
[10:49:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah Velveeta_ noooooo
[10:49:45] * Velveeta_ throws his head back and lets out an ear-piercing shriek.
[10:50:12] <duch_kazatel> oh noez Velveeta_ is on a RAMpage!
[10:50:40] * Velveeta_ thrashes as his RAMpage is swapped in and out by other processes!
[10:50:56] <Velveeta_> awwwwww, windows, you found my only weakness!
[10:51:52] <PantsOfChoco> GOJIRA YA RACIST
[10:52:44] <Velveeta_> me, racist? impossibru!
[10:53:16] <systemfault> He would have to be a human to be racist, he’s processed cheese.
[10:53:41] <tw2113> i heard Velveeta_ was secretly curdled
[10:53:45] <systemfault> Highly processed… imho… if he can write on IRC
[10:54:31] <Velveeta_> +1
[10:54:31] <duch_kazatel> that joke was pretty... cheesy.
[10:55:07] <systemfault> Ba dum tsshhhh!
[10:55:36] <coby> haha
[10:56:03] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: what if i want the value but also the label of the option?   <option value="1">This nice text</option>
[10:56:11] <PantsOfChoco> damn i thought that guys name was colby and it was his time to shine in cheese puns
[10:56:17] <Miles8of9> this.value returns the value
[11:00:26] <duch_kazatel> then you'll have to find the corresponding label element.
[11:00:46] <Miles8of9> how?
[11:00:57] <duch_kazatel> depends on how your shit's setup.
[11:01:16] <Velveeta_> by "label" do you mean the "This nice text" portion?
[11:01:19] <duch_kazatel> oh you want the text of the option.
[11:01:21] <duch_kazatel> .text()
[11:01:21] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: usually nicer
[11:01:27] <Velveeta_> ^^ what duch just said
[11:01:39] <duch_kazatel> thought you were talking about a <label> element.
[11:01:57] <Miles8of9> no no... the text of the option
[11:02:06] <duch_kazatel> right - .text() of the selected option.
[11:02:29] <Miles8of9> and how do i get the selected option?
[11:03:06] <Miles8of9> i don't know where to find these things... sorry for disturbing you
[11:03:21] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the selected option in your change handler.
[11:04:08] <erisco> I have tried both powerTip and tooltipster... when I tell either one to open the tooltip, nothing happens
[11:04:15] <erisco> what have I done? :(
[11:04:18] <duch_kazatel> any errors in the console?
[11:04:34] <Miles8of9> returns all text of all options not only the one selected :|
[11:04:34] <erisco> nope
[11:04:54] <erisco> oh... it is expecting mouse over (powerTip)
[11:04:56] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 oh that's right you have to find the :selected one.
[11:05:05] <duch_kazatel> erisco you can change that behavior.
[11:06:37] <Zzaichik> '.classname:selected'  -or- .is('selected')
[11:06:47] <Zzaichik> I think
[11:07:14] <Miles8of9> $(this:selected).text()
[11:07:16] <Miles8of9> ??
[11:07:31] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find(':selected')
[11:07:38] <duch_kazatel> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[11:08:08] <Miles8of9> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-get-the-text-value-of-a-selected-option/     i did.. but code there is a lot different from mine :|
[11:08:24] <Zzaichik> Yeah I came into the conversation late.  you don't need $(this)   it would just be $('option:selected').doStuff();
[11:08:37] <erisco> duch_kazatel, seems that when I open one tooltip the other closes...
[11:08:39] <Zzaichik> OR like duch_kazatel said.
[11:08:39] <erisco> can I disable that
[11:09:04] <duch_kazatel> Zzaichik you need $(this) if there are multipl selects on the page.
[11:09:11] <duch_kazatel> erisco you should be able to, yes.
[11:09:24] <erisco> well I have not found how =\
[11:09:25] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 the important bit is $( "#myselect option:selected" ).text();
[11:09:45] <erisco> "Closes any open tooltip. You do not need to specify which tooltip you would like to close (because there can be only one)."
[11:09:47] <erisco> well this is a huge problem
[11:09:56] <duch_kazatel> you could change that to $(this).find('option:selected').text(); could also be
[11:09:58] <decx> Miles8of9 this.childNodes[this.selectedIndex].text
[11:10:05] <duch_kazatel> erisco I'm pretty sure you can disable that.
[11:10:38] <erisco> "Remember that one of the rules for PowerTip is that only one tooltip will be visible at a time, so any open tooltips will be closed before a new tooltip is shown."
[11:10:54] <Miles8of9> omg thankyou...
[11:11:01] <Miles8of9> i'm starting to hate jquery
[11:11:11] <duch_kazatel> erisco look at the section titled "Building your own event handlers"
[11:11:25] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 you should really read the tutorial to learn about basic DOM traversal.
[11:11:27] <duch_kazatel> this is easy stuff.
[11:11:51] <duch_kazatel> erisco $('.tooltips').powerTip({ manual: true }); and then do your own event bindings.
[11:11:52] <Miles8of9> what's the difference between a plugin and a widget?
[11:12:08] <erisco> duch_kazatel, I am on manual already
[11:12:13] <duch_kazatel> a plugin is something that extends jquery's functionality.  a widget is a visual component.
[11:12:28] <erisco> doesn't matter. I will just change the design and they can deal with it :P
[11:12:42] <duch_kazatel> erisco uh, then you';re doing something wrong.
[11:24:02] <erisco> duch_kazatel, maybe there is more stuff to override but I do not have the time for that so this will have to do
[11:24:10] <duch_kazatel> kay
[11:24:21] <erisco> though a problem I do need to fix is that for some reason the tooltip closes the second time I click the button to show it
[11:24:37] <erisco> my steps are  hide(), powerTip(), show()
[11:25:02] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code it's hard to help.
[11:25:18] <erisco> don't worry about it then :)
[11:25:28] <duch_kazatel> but if you're re-initializing, that's a problem.
[11:25:53] <erisco> hm, well if I had a way to check if it was already initialized that would be cool
[11:26:41] <duch_kazatel> why do you need to do that?
[11:27:12] <erisco> so that I do not initialize twice
[11:27:14] <erisco> if that is the problem
[11:27:26] <erisco> though I do not know any other way to change the placement
[11:27:26] <duch_kazatel> why are you initializing twice?
[11:27:31] <duch_kazatel> run that once on pageload.
[11:27:39] <erisco> the element does not exist on page load =\
[11:27:59] <duch_kazatel> then init after using a callback.
[11:28:47] <ericx2x> Hey, I made this navigator but some of the items take up a lot of space when they aren't collapsed. How do I make it so that the items go into their own scrollable area so it doesn't take up so much vertical space? http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/
[11:29:24] <erisco> also it does not answer how I change the placement
[11:29:35] <erisco> some tooltips need to be placed east and others north
[11:29:46] <duch_kazatel> the documentation clearly lays all of that out.
[11:30:10] <erisco> the only way it says how to manually open is to use the show() function, and you cannot specify options there
[11:30:21] <erisco> so it seems the only way to specify the placement is to call powerTip() again
[11:30:37] <duch_kazatel> do you need to reposition them AFTER they've been inited?
[11:31:10] <erisco> no
[11:31:32] <duch_kazatel> then you init them in the right place using the .powerTip() function a show/hide them as necessary.
[11:31:35] <erisco> the init is not a global thing? I guess not since you provide an element to use
[11:31:45] <duch_kazatel> you can init on all of them at once.
[11:31:47] <jParkton> duch you use node much?
[11:31:59] <duch_kazatel> jParkton a little.  not a ton right now.
[11:32:03] <jParkton> http://react-bootstrap.github.io/
[11:32:07] <jParkton> when you do
[11:32:13] <jParkton> <3 that
[11:32:37] <duch_kazatel> lol i won't have much of a choice on that when I start, but thanks,.
[11:33:06] <erisco> looks like it removes the title attribute when it shows the tooltip... guess I can use that to detect init state
[11:33:22] <simsketch_> anyone have an idea of how to pull an image link out of a JSON value?
[11:33:47] <duch_kazatel> erisco why in the world are you initing twice?
[11:33:56] <erisco> it happens on a click handler
[11:34:00] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[11:34:00] <erisco> so if you click twice it inits twice
[11:34:03] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea.
[11:34:07] <erisco> yes it is
[11:34:09] <duch_kazatel> how are you loading in content?
[11:37:11] <erisco> duch_kazatel, it worked! hurrah
[11:37:22] <erisco> and somewhere a kitten died
[11:38:18] <Dramors> Hey people, quick question: I was looking over at http://api.jqueryui.com/switchclass/ where it states that  it extends jq's built-in switchClass method and links to it. The link is dead, was that removed from jq?
[11:38:36] <Dramors> http://api.jquery.com/switchClass <-- said link
[11:40:38] <Dramors> And yes I realize I can removeClass().addClass(), just curious to see if I can type less :P
[11:40:48] <duch_kazatel> erisco init inside of the callback for whatever you're loading.
[11:44:39] <ericx2x> Can someone make it so that where ever the items lists appear they are scrollable within that container? Requires you to uncollapse to see the item lists. http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/
[11:47:38] <mdev> eric maybe check out multiaccordian jquery plugin
[11:48:35] <Zzaichik> ericx2x: You want CSS maybe? I'm not sure I fully understand the request. Do you want the main links to always show up and then the sub links to scroll if they go beyond a certain height?
[11:50:25] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup around ?
[11:50:38] <Vivekananda_y510> btw you eating curry , where are you from ?
[11:50:48] <mdev> my guess they're in India
[11:51:00] <Vivekananda_y510> mdev, you too ?
[11:51:09] <Zzaichik> ericx2x: http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/1/
[11:51:35] <mdev> just never heard of anyone eating curry really, except india and maybe middle east but i'm ignorant on the subject
[11:51:38] <mdev> :p
[11:51:54] <duch_kazatel> and in thailand and in the US and in the UK and...
[11:52:03] <Zzaichik> haha
[11:52:04] <duch_kazatel> lots of people eat curry
[11:52:10] <Zzaichik> I don't care for it.
[11:52:24] <Zzaichik> Not bad, nothing to go crazy over.
[11:52:48] <duch_kazatel> some people are really into it.
[11:53:06] <Zzaichik> for sure
[11:53:41] <ericx2x> Zzaichik: yeah that was what I was looking for.
[11:53:43] <ericx2x> THanks man
[11:54:13] <Zzaichik> ericx2x: no problem - all i added was that top CSS  "ul li ul, ul li ol { …"
[11:54:13] <ericx2x> Can you tell me what you changed or added?
[11:54:21] <ericx2x> okay
[11:54:22] <ericx2x> thanks
[11:55:09] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/3/
[11:55:40] <erisco> duch_kazatel, hehe, I was lucky and found the right spot to run the initialize :) I can sleep better tonight now
[11:59:23] <Zzaichik> ericx2x: also - this… http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/4/
[12:01:45] <simsketch_> hey guys...anyone feel like helping me implement jQuery's .match() with a regex expression in a json string?
[12:03:08] <Zzaichik> Or actually - ericx2x  - http://jsfiddle.net/SbFEc/6/   This is doing exactly what you were before, just one line though.
[12:10:41] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm updating a part with Ajax. PHP makes it behave differently when updated but it doesn't get to know it has been updated. How can I refresh just that element area to make it take changes?
[12:11:25] <NoiseEee> bl4ckdu5t: what
[12:12:40] <bl4ckdu5t> NoiseEee: I just want to refresh a button
[12:12:58] <NoiseEee> bl4ckdu5t: so after the xhr/ajax is complete, update the button
[12:13:06] <bl4ckdu5t> There's a PHP script that says if the database value is 1, make button gray
[12:13:20] <bl4ckdu5t> clicking on it makes it send a value 1 to DB with ajax
[12:13:29] <bl4ckdu5t> it doesn't turn gray till I refresh
[12:14:23] <NoiseEee> so then when the xhr/ajax class is done, add a class to the button... where the class makes the button 'grey' or whatever. or do you mean 'grey' as in disabled or
[12:14:33] <NoiseEee> s/class/operation
[12:15:10] <bl4ckdu5t> yea
[12:15:19] <bl4ckdu5t> to make it disabled
[12:16:21] <karamazov> I'm a bit confused about browser compatibility with jquery. Is there a list of commands I can and can't use for a browser like IE7. The plugin I'm using to rotate images is supposed to support IE7 but it's currently breaking.
[12:20:45] <NoiseEee> bl4ckdu5t: see the .done callback hook in http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/  (ie: search that page for 'Save some data to the server and notify the user once it's complete')
[12:31:13] <bl4ckdu5t> NoiseEee: here http://jsfiddle.net/v6wk4/
[12:31:43] <bl4ckdu5t> My PHP isn't really returning anything, it's just taking an action
[12:32:03] <bl4ckdu5t> but when the action is taken, it determines the behaviour of the button on the page
[12:32:05] <NoiseEee> bl4ckdu5t: well the replaceWith() seems to indicate its sending back something...
[12:32:26] <NoiseEee> bl4ckdu5t: but that aside, just put a $(yourButtonReference).prop("disabled","disabled") and you should be good to go
[12:32:26] <bl4ckdu5t> Yea! That's the solution I found by searching but I don't think it's what I need
[12:32:34] <bl4ckdu5t> I just need it to refresh
[12:32:46] <NoiseEee> no, you don't need it to refresh. refresh is loading the page.
[12:32:57] <NoiseEee> you adjust the current page and disable the button.
[12:33:22] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[12:33:56] <bl4ckdu5t> but I just remembered, I have another div that keeps record of the DB status of that button
[12:34:28] <NoiseEee> you can put as many functions/do as much as you like in your .done(), bl4ckdu5t
[12:34:48] <bl4ckdu5t> those that mean I'll still have to load the page
[12:35:01] <bl4ckdu5t> .load($pageurl)
[12:35:37] <NoiseEee> no
[12:35:43] <Ansikt> Is there a way to make an event which functions like jQuery(document).ready()?  Which is to say, any time you bind a callback to it, it fires once and precisely once?
[12:36:09] <NoiseEee> Ansikt: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[12:37:05] <Ansikt> NoiseEee: That's actually the opposite of what I'm looking for.  One just fires the event then unbinds it.  What I would like to do, is have an event which fires, and then EVEN AFTER IT FIRES, subsequent event handlers which become attached immediately fire?
[12:37:44] <Ansikt> Eg. If I run $(document).ready(function(){alert("hello!")}); 5 minutes after the page finished loading, I'll still see a "hello!" popup.
[12:38:06] <NoiseEee> thats a bad example come up with a better one
[12:38:44] <NoiseEee> "...EVEN AFTER IT FIRES, subsequent event handlers which become attached immediately fire"
[12:38:48] <NoiseEee> ^^ that happens anyways?
[12:39:19] <Ansikt> NoiseEee: Okay, sure.  If I load a script asynch after window.onload has already fired, and my script contains a document.ready event handler, that handler will fire, even though document.ready probably happend a couple hundred msago.
[12:39:22] <Ansikt> *ms ago
[12:39:27] <Ansikt> *async
[12:40:15] <Ansikt> Where as, if I bind a click handler to a button, THEN click the button, THEN bind an event handler to it, the event handler doesn't fire.
[12:40:27] <Ansikt> Sorry, I said that last one wrong.
[12:40:44] <Ansikt> Where as, if I click a button, THEN bind an event handler to the button, the event handler doesn't fire.
[12:42:44] <NoiseEee> well in that case why wouldnt you just call the handler/callback right away?  ie: instead of $(button).on('click',function() { console.log('im clicked')});   after the click, just console.log('im clicked')
[12:44:28] <NoiseEee> (i'm assuming that by "the event handler doesn't fire" you mean it doesnt fire right away/at the same time - of course it would fire on subsequent clicks)
[12:45:15] <Ansikt> In the async script example, I don't know what happens first - did my script load first, or did document.ready fire first?  If it's the former, jQuery waits until document.ready to fire the callback.  If it's the latter, jQuery executes the callback immediately.  I would like to be able to create custom events which have a similar functionality.
[12:47:19] <Ansikt> Does that clear things up?  Sometimes, I don't know if the event HAS fired, or if it still WILL fire.  I haven't found documentation for this anywhere, but I'd imagine the interface for jQuery's ready event is based off of the jQuery Event API.
[12:48:03] <NoiseEee> mmm i don't think it works that way / is possible
[12:50:08] <Ansikt> It might not be possible, but it does work that way.  Go to jQuery.com, wait for the page to finish loading then run: $(function(){alert("Hi NoiseEee")});
[12:50:36] <Ansikt> If .ready worked like .click, this wouldn't work.
[12:50:46] <Ansikt> But I get your point - I can just impliment in plain js
[13:04:41] <BillCriswell> Is it weird that I'm picking up Backbone slower than I did angular?
[13:04:47] <BillCriswell> I think my brain is broken.
[13:15:02] <robdev> How would one best approach a "anchorable" sphere that was animated - just rotating
[13:15:32] <robdev> would a canvas lose it's anchors once animated?
[13:16:09] <robdev> can I upload an img and share the URL in the channel?  is that allowed?
[13:17:04] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: I'm being told that I shouldnt put a $ before a variable holding an integer. Is this true?
[13:18:32] <robdev> http://s18.postimg.org/dndzcol4p/Untitled_11_copy.jpg - this is what I'm trying to rotate but allow the larger "dots" to be anchors or "clickab'e
[13:18:37] <robdev> "clickable"
[13:19:10] <duch_kazatel> karamazov only put $ in front of jquery objects.
[13:19:18] <karamazov> Gah. Ok.
[13:19:19] <duch_kazatel> not strings, numbers, arrays, plain objects.
[13:19:22] <duch_kazatel> just jquery.
[13:30:27] <Velveeta> duuuuuuuuuuuuch, <ping!> duch_kazatel
[13:33:48] <Velveeta> billcriswell: and yes, that is weird.. your brain might indeed be broken :D
[13:45:17] <litewait> I can see a simple way to change button text when the button is styled.  Changing the text loses the styling.  Does anyone have an example?
[13:45:22] <litewait> s/can/can't/
[13:47:26] <NoiseEee> litewait: a <button> ?
[13:47:34] <litewait> .button()
[13:47:36] <litewait> right
[13:47:39] <NoiseEee> $(someButtonReference).text('hello')
[13:47:55] <litewait> blows away the styling
[13:48:06] <NoiseEee> show me that on a fiddle
[13:48:11] <litewait> .button() seems to change the  html
[13:48:11] <NoiseEee> because i say 'nope'
[13:48:18] <NoiseEee> why are you using button()
[13:48:34] <litewait> to get jquery-ui to style it
[13:49:15] <NoiseEee> i dont use -ui, but i don't see why you would be needing to do anything with button() at all if you just want to change the text of the button.
[13:49:43] <NoiseEee> it's already been button'd by jquery-ui
[13:50:03] <decx> what a prude
[13:52:10] <litewait> dynamically, a database record tells me this record is active or inactive so I have to do it after an ajax request
[13:52:52] <daraand> Hi all. For the past few months a bunch of you have helped me here tremendously. I wanted to share the fruit of the labor: http://theoryanimation.com  Powered by a lot of jQuery and HTML5 :D I'm open to critiques too, though admittedly my brain is fried hehe.
[13:58:00] <Jattenalle> daraand, nice
[13:58:35] <daraand> Thanks jattenalle :)
[13:58:53] <Jattenalle> the "plz wider!" message is a bit silly, but i see why it's there
[14:00:07] <Jattenalle> daraand, as such http://i.imgur.com/V2TGpQs.png :P
[14:00:29] <daraand> haha
[14:01:01] <daraand> I had no idea how to get around that, and doing a little focus testing with friends I noticed a lot of them viewed pages like that (naturally right? articles and stuff)
[14:01:13] <daraand> and having this giant block of blue was rather unsettling...
[14:01:21] <bjensen82> I have this document: http://jsfiddle.net/TeYgB/ its a collection of <div class="day">s one for each day of the year. However they all have a data-wage-period-id. I want to do a loop so that all those days with one wage period id gets light blue background and all those days which belongs to the next wage period-id gets dark blue and the next light blue and so on. How can I make a cycle like that?
[14:01:23] <daraand> so... I figured I'd put somethign there
[14:01:34] <Jattenalle> it's fine, it gets the point across :P
[14:02:13] <daraand> I had one person tell me forcing an aspect ratio on people is a bad idea. But the animation calls for it, so I went with it. Cropping the videos didnt look good either (for tall browser windows)
[14:02:27] <Jattenalle> aye, it's fine
[14:02:41] <Jattenalle> one thing you could do is add that blue border you have at the top, to the bottom as well
[14:09:40] <AcidRain2012> bjensen82 there wasnt 29 days in feb this year
[14:09:47] <AcidRain2012> just sayin :)
[14:09:57] <bjensen82> AcidRain2012: hehe its for 2016 :-)
[14:10:11] <AcidRain2012> ;p
[14:11:02] <bjensen82> do you see the issue? i cant do a simple $.each % 2 thingie
[14:11:40] <daraand> That's  good idea. Kind of wrap it all. Thanks for looking jattenalle :D  What do you do?
[14:12:16] <Jattenalle> daraand, right now, fixing a bug with tooltips not showing up properly in my game
[14:16:28] <decx> bjensen82 why not use css?
[14:17:55] <bjensen82> decx: well how would I do that when the background color should be defined by the data-wage-period-id ?
[14:18:26] <decx> so the higher wage period the darker the blue?
[14:18:59] <bjensen82> I have a bunch of days with the data-wage-period-id's. I want it so that you cant see the diference of them by alternating light blue and dark blue
[14:19:14] <bjensen82> based on the wage-period-ids.
[14:19:35] <bjensen82> Multiple days can have the same data-wage-period-id
[14:22:50] <decx> wait you dont want to see a difference?
[14:22:52] <decx> ^^
[14:23:08] <daraand> jattenalle: bugs are not fun. I dont envy you, but I hope the game comes out well :D I'll leave you work, but if you have time I'd like to know what game :P
[14:23:09] <bjensen82> decx: what do you mean?
[14:23:21] <bjensen82> ohh sorry
[14:23:36] <bjensen82> ofcause I want it so you can see the difference. Which wage period each day is associated to
[14:24:03] <Jattenalle> daraand, this is a nice easily fixed bug, for once.. game is http://www.godsandidols.com/about/
[14:24:33] <dbizzy__> I’m trying to find the largest height. Here is what I tried http://pastebin.com/MjN3qTGB any thoughts how i can fix it?
[14:28:16] <decx> bjensen82 you can do in a css()
[14:28:29] <bjensen82> decx: please enlighten me then
[14:28:51] <decx> ok mom
[14:31:45] <decx> bjensen82 http://jsfiddle.net/TeYgB/1/
[14:33:14] <bjensen82> decx: thanks but what If i want it to alternate between two colors?
[14:34:22] <decx> but there are more than 2 wageperiodids
[14:34:51] <bjensen82> exactly so it would change between two colors, alternate.
[14:35:09] <bjensen82> the first wage period would be light blue, the next dark blue, the next light blue and so on
[14:35:15] <dbizzy_> How would I find the largest height of all divs?
[14:36:00] <SethT> how do i bind an event to fire after content is appended to an element
[14:36:26] <dbizzy_> append(function(){})
[14:36:28] <decx> bjensen82 easy enough http://jsfiddle.net/TeYgB/3/
[14:36:54] <dbizzy_> whatever you put in the function happens after it appends
[14:40:09] <SethT> i dont want to modify the function directly i want to bind to it from another js script
[14:41:44] <bjensen82> decx: Thanks!! Let me entertain you with my horrible approach. A Gist: var periods = []; $(".day").each(function(index) { periods.push($(this).data("data-wage-period-id"))}); periods.distinct; periods.each(function(index) { $(".day[dage-wage-period-id]=" + periods[index]).css("background-color", index % 2)})
[14:41:54] <bjensen82> decx: so thank you very much :-)
[14:43:35] <decx> so many each :>
[14:47:26] <bjensen82> decx: there is one flaw though I think. The wage-period-id does not need to be in a row. they could be 2, 4, 6. so the simple % 2 wouldnt work..
[14:48:28] <decx> well good luck with that
[14:48:31] <decx> ^^
[14:49:24] <bjensen82> decx: well thats why I am here :-)
[15:01:14] <dbizzy_> figured my question out incase anyone wanted to know this is how i did it:
[15:01:14] <dbizzy_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7816556/
[15:01:47] <karamazov> So IE7-9 aren't running the callback on my rotation function. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/i2etA8Ud
[15:08:22] <systemfault> karamazov: It’s probably because of the console.log
[15:08:54] <karamazov> oh - that's no longer there
[15:09:15] <systemfault> Ah :(
[15:09:17] <karamazov> I've narrowed it down to the issue being the conditional. For some reason those versions don't like it
[15:09:26] <karamazov> Thanks for looking! :)
[15:23:11] <beachandbytes> Is there anyway to trigger a link to open in a new tab vs new window?
[15:23:19] <duch_kazatel> not reliably.
[15:23:32] <duch_kazatel> that's controlled by the users' browser.
[15:24:03] <beachandbytes> any unreliable way, I've tried setting a hidden <a> element and .click() but that didn't work
[15:25:12] <duch_kazatel> not really.  the user's browser controls what happens with links that use target="_blank"
[15:32:51] <beachandbytes> Why does the browser act differently If I trigger a click event vs if I actually click
[15:33:40] <duch_kazatel> because trigger can be used to do malicious things on behalf of the user.
[15:34:38] <duch_kazatel> and also: jquery events are distinct from the browser's native events.
[15:37:33] <beachandbytes> ahh
[16:02:35] <Vivekananda_y510> thanks a lot mooncup I have the parts working now .
[16:39:16] <jeremyroe> HI guys - Could use a hand with an .each ajax refresh - I’m trying to take the last 5 service tickets from our system and update them on an html page - The best I’ve been able to do is create a loop that appends the same 5 lines over and over  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=VyMeQszD0L
[16:42:06] <jeremyroe> this might be a better link - the other looks like it’s a collaboration one - first time using jfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jeremyroe/QHdz5/
[16:43:25] <TaylorHu> Doesn't seem like there's any active people in here
[16:43:37] <systemfault> Nope, all bots.
[16:43:44] <systemfault> I’m a bot too
[16:43:54] <TaylorHu> Fibber
[16:44:31] <TaylorHu> Question, what's the best way to constantly run a jQuery command at regular intervals.  Specifically a classToggle.
[16:44:40] <TaylorHu> Basically I want to toggle the class every 5 seconds or something
[16:45:19] <systemfault> TaylorHu: An async loop using setTimeout
[17:02:26] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: nice
[17:06:36] <darkspadez> Can anyone point me in the right direction? I have a site that needs a carousel but the carousel needs to update two different elements on the page
[17:07:07] <djQuery> ?g jquery connected carousel
[17:07:08] <b-ot> djQuery: jCarousel - Riding carousels with jQuery - sorgalla.com → http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[17:07:59] <djQuery> darkspadez, wow looks like the first hit is the right one.http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/examples/connected-carousels/
[17:08:12] <darkspadez> thank you djQuery
[17:25:30] <aftab> Hello, I have a 2 column website, left column has some posts with images and links and right column has the main post content with previous post and next post links at the bottom, whenever I click on any post link it loads the content to right column using ajax and also loads the previous next links for the other posts, I have set a function on previous and next post link to highlight some text
[17:25:31] <aftab> on the left column and it doesn't trigger when the previous and next links are loaded via ajax, please let me know how to fix it? I can show you example on my website
[17:27:12] <aftab> I also used $(window).on ("click", ".nav-previous a", function () { // my code }); but it doesn't even work on the links loaded with page load and $(".nav-previous a").on("click", function () {}); only works with the links loaded with the page not with the links loaded with ajax
[19:00:04] <bePolite> I have a function I want to run each time the DOM updates. Please how can I do that with jquery
[19:26:36] <ravenzz> ?mdn mutation observer @ bePolite
[19:26:38] <b-ot> bePolite: vorjack Archive at Planet Atheism → http://planetatheism.com/author/vorjack/
[19:26:42] <ravenzz> lol
[19:26:45] <ravenzz> what is that
[19:27:11] <ravenzz> ?q mdn mutation observer @ bePolite
[19:27:23] <jeremyroe> I have some json I’m working with within an .each command and the 2nd level starts returning [object Objects] how do I reference this within a 2nd level .each function
[19:27:32] <ravenzz> it's been a while since I've used this bawt
[19:28:31] <ravenzz> jeremyroe: do you mean `this`
[19:28:42] <ravenzz> like the fn context?
[19:29:01] <jeremyroe> maybe - I’m very new to jquery and don’t have a good grasp of ‘this’ - if that’s what I should be using I’ll bone up on it
[19:29:36] <ravenzz> ?demo @ jeremyroe
[19:29:37] <b-ot> jeremyroe: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:30:08] <jeremyroe> it’s not working but code is here http://jsfiddle.net/jeremyroe/QHdz5/ or you can view it at dev.adoninetworks.com in firebug or similar
[19:38:08] <bePolite> ravenzz: I saw the stuff on objservers
[19:38:19] <ravenzz> hehe
[19:38:22] <bePolite> Just that they work only on IE >=11
[19:38:48] <ravenzz> welcome to the web dev realm
[19:48:55] <jeremyroe> thanks - ‘this’ did the trick and I now understand it a little bit more - any tips for ajax refreshing a list of 5 items returned without “flashing” or appending a neverending list . . . I’m lost on where to go from here in that respect
[19:50:05] <Velveeta> objservers?
[19:51:18] <jeremyroe> no idea what that is but I’ll look into it
[19:52:30] <jeremyroe> I may already have that part working . . . . you can see the issue at dev.adoninetworks.com - Essentially I’m doing an append after doing an ajax refresh posting the data via JSON from PHP - I think I’m just handling the output poorly
[19:53:00] <jeremyroe> but maybe I have to loop it through another objserver to combine the 5 ‘object’s into a single one that updates . . .
[20:37:59] <baadshah> Hi
[20:38:34] <baadshah> I need some help with a website I'm designing, and we have to launch it very soon
[20:38:44] <baadshah> Can someone help me?
[20:43:42] <jeremyroe> what are you stuck on baadshah - not sure I can help much but who knows
[21:10:01] <baadshah> hey @jeremyroe, thanks for replying
[21:10:12] <baadshah> i have a few tabs on my site, and i've a footer
[21:11:12] <baadshah> now the tabs have some queries that it goes through to get info from database, so what's happening is that the footer gets loaded before the tab gets loaded
[21:11:31] <baadshah> i'm exploring Jquery's Deferred Object api
[22:23:49] <funhouse> A friend of mine says forget jQuery and use angularJs, but I feel jquery is good enough for any basic web app, and it seems more well supported, is there any advantage to using angular?
[22:33:12] <obert> funhouse: it is a sort of 'jquery is a state of art of html4, angular for html5
[22:42:43] <funhouse> obert: ok
[23:24:37] <antlong> I have an open source game, and we'd love some contributors. www.multiverseminer.com
[23:25:25] <mdev> would it be more efficient to lookup things when users type via ajax
[23:25:28] <mdev> or websocket
[23:25:53] <antlong> ajax would be more efficient i reckon
[23:27:42] <mdev> I thought websockets were for real-time/less overhead, not the case?
[23:29:07] <antlong> sure, but with efficiency in mind, if you used web sockets you would have to write ajax as a fall back
[23:29:59] <mdev> oh ok, yeah i'm using socket.io thta already does that
[23:30:09] <mdev> long ajax polls if not supported
[23:31:30] <antlong> should be good then
[23:35:07] <mdev> one more thing I have to store a lot of strings in an array
[23:35:25] <mdev> is sorting for each addition and using binary search the fastest method for this
[23:35:36] <mdev> or does javascript have something better/or you know of a better way
[23:35:45] <mdev> each array could have a couple thousand entries
[23:36:39] <mdev> javascript/jquery
[23:37:40] <antlong> hmn
[23:38:58] <antlong> i can't really say, I'm not positive
[23:39:02] <antlong> are you using backbone or anything?
[23:40:30] <mdev> backbone?
[23:41:44] <antlong> backbonejs.org
