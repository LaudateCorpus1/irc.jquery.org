[00:03:57] <prefixed> if I click a specific h3, how would I go about updating css attributes of a specific div down the dom?
[00:08:52] <Whirl3d> does html5 make the use of jquery history obsolete? And how does any of this relate to Ben Allmen's BBQ or Hashchange plugins?
[00:35:46] <jarray52> I've created a calendar object attached to an element with a myclass using $('.myclass').dateinput();. This element is inside of a form. The calendar works fine until the form is submitted. However, after form submission, the calendar no longer works. Any suggestions on what might be causing this problem?
[00:46:33] <Whirl3d> what do you mean by "No longer works"
[00:48:19] <Whirl3d> when you submit the form, can you change the other field values? Perhaps form submission includes a measure that disables changing the form data after submitting?
[00:50:09] <jarray52> Whirl3d: When I click on the date input box(an input element), the calendar initially pops up. After form submission, the graphical calendar does not pop-up when I click(focus) on the date input box.
[00:50:40] <Whirl3d> but all the other fields work?
[00:51:09] <jarray52> Whirl3d: However, I can still change the date manually in the date input box and submit the form again. All the fields in the form work. It is only the calendar that does not pop up.
[00:51:40] <Whirl3d> and where did you get the calendar popup script.? jquery UI?
[00:52:32] <jarray52> http://jquerytools.org/documentation/dateinput/index.html
[00:54:12] <jarray52> Interestingly, if I add an event that binds to ajax:complete and use dateinput on some other element, I can attach a calendar to that element the second time around. However, I cannot reattach the calendar to the element to which it was previously attached using dateinput.
[00:54:30] <jarray52> This is true even if I unbind all events from that element.
[00:55:00] <Whirl3d> I'm afraid you are going to have to create a working example on jsbin
[00:55:11] <Whirl3d> it's sounds like a plugin behavior problem
[00:56:18] <jarray52> Whirl3d: I've been working on this issue for a couple of days now. So, perhaps it is time to create a minimal example with all the libraries so that other people can reproduce it.
[00:56:37] <Whirl3d> did you check the forum?
[00:57:06] <jarray52> Yes. I tried searching to see if this was a know bug... I didn't really do anything non-standard.
[00:57:18] <jarray52> s/know/known
[00:57:40] <Whirl3d> do you somehow duplicate the field?
[00:57:47] <Whirl3d> is it referenced by ID?
[00:58:03] <jarray52> What do you mean by duplicate the field?
[00:58:16] <Whirl3d> try chaning the ID to something really weird. Perhaps the content you are loading has a similiarly named field. Then it would become inaccessible
[00:58:36] <jarray52> I'm referencing by class.
[00:59:04] <jarray52> However, I tried attaching it to several different classes within that form, and I have exactly the same behavior.
[00:59:21] <jarray52> to different classes and elements.
[00:59:26] <Whirl3d> Do you have the behavior outside of a form element
[01:00:08] <jarray52> I'm not sure what that would mean in the context of this question.
[01:00:21] <jarray52> The calendar works before the form is submitted the first time.
[01:00:37] <jarray52> It is only after form submission that the calendar doesn't display.
[01:00:37] <Whirl3d> if it happens inside a form, perhaps it's the form's submission handler.
[01:01:19] <jarray52> Are you suggesting attaching to an element outside the form and seeing if the element still works after the form submission?
[01:01:27] <Whirl3d> yes
[01:01:33] <Whirl3d> Just as a curiosity
[01:01:39] <jarray52> Since the form submission only affects things inside the form, it should still work.
[01:02:00] <jarray52> However, let me confirm that... maybe form submission affects the whole page.
[01:02:28] <Whirl3d> How are you submitting the form? Do you capture the submit action and prepare the request for ajax? If not, try that.
[01:06:55] <jarray52> If the element is outside the form, it still works after form submission.
[01:07:20] <Whirl3d> so what is happening during submission?
[01:07:56] <jarray52> I am submitting the form using ordinary html.
[01:08:00] <Whirl3d> do you have a form action='do something'    or are you manually submitting the form $(form).on("submit', fucntion () {handle form
[01:08:23] <jarray52> It is not being done through ajax.
[01:08:39] <Whirl3d> rather than form action=.....
[01:09:17] <jarray52> <input class="update" name="commit" type="submit" value="NEXT">
[01:09:18] <Whirl3d> try $("form").on("submit", function (e) {e.preventDefault();  and then $.load(url in formaction)
[01:10:21] <Whirl3d> then we can comment out the load method and check the field. to see if it's broken yet
[01:10:41] <jarray52> I'm using Rails; so, I'll have to translate that into the equivalent.
[01:10:49] <jarray52> One second.
[01:12:02] <jarray52> Whirl3d: I'll try that in a second. I want to mention the following first.
[01:12:24] <jarray52> I created two event handlers
[01:12:33] <jarray52> One on submit
[01:12:48] <jarray52> and one on ajax:complete
[01:13:18] <Whirl3d> I thought you said it wasn't being done through ajax?
[01:15:27] <jarray52> Sorry... your question confused me for a moment.
[01:15:40] <jarray52> I am not using Ajax for the form submission.
[01:15:59] <jarray52> However, the form is in a pop up modal(jquery reveal).
[01:16:01] <Whirl3d> what is the literal string aftter form action=___________
[01:16:52] <jarray52> The popup modal closes after form submission. That completes the ajax and triggers the ajax:complete event handler.
[01:17:00] <jarray52> At least, that is my understanding.
[01:17:33] <Whirl3d> so the form is in the popup modal?
[01:17:36] <jarray52> Are you asking what type of request it is? It is a post request.
[01:17:49] <jarray52> Yes. The form is in the popup modal.
[01:18:11] <Whirl3d> so before ajaxcomplete, the field is disabled?
[01:18:45] <jarray52> The field is never disabled.
[01:18:53] <jarray52> I can always manually edit the field.
[01:19:12] <jarray52> However, the calendar does not appear when I click in the box. So, I have to manually enter the date.
[01:19:38] <jarray52> When you say the field is disabled, do you mean the calendar does not pop up?
[01:19:44] <Whirl3d> it may be because something else has grabbed the click event or the focus event and prevented default
[01:20:27] <Whirl3d> is there form validation?
[01:20:36] <jarray52> I checked in the debugger. It is a focus event.
[01:20:39] <Whirl3d> does it check each field and perhaps change it's class?
[01:20:49] <jarray52> The second time around, the focus event is missing.
[01:21:11] <jarray52> The class remains the same.
[01:21:42] <Whirl3d> is the date the last field entered?
[01:21:45] <jarray52> Furthermore, if I attach the calendar in the ajax:complete event to another element, that elements calendar works.
[01:21:55] <jarray52> No, the date is not the last field.
[01:22:13] <Whirl3d> is it writing over your form?
[01:22:27] <jarray52> Is what writing over my form?
[01:22:39] <Whirl3d> is the ajax result writing over your form?
[01:23:10] <Whirl3d> sometimes, a form will spit back at you after you submit it just to show you what it received.
[01:23:18] <jarray52> I created an ajax:complete event handler.
[01:23:52] <jarray52> No, nothing is writing over my form as far as I can tell.
[01:24:16] <jarray52> The form is in an overlay that becomes invisible after the form is submitted.
[01:24:18] <Whirl3d> You are just going to have to create an example.
[01:24:27] <jarray52> That's what I thought.
[01:24:34] <Whirl3d> becomes invisible?
[01:24:46] <Whirl3d> than how can you expect to enter the date again?
[01:24:47] <jarray52> the overlay has a display attribute.
[01:25:07] <jarray52> the display is set to none to make the form invisible.
[01:25:21] <Whirl3d> then you click on the date field....not
[01:25:24] <jarray52> To enter into the form again, an element has to be clicked again.
[01:25:30] <Whirl3d> you can't see the date field.
[01:25:56] <jarray52> More specifically, the edit link has to be clicked. Once clicked, the form becomes visible.
[01:25:58] <Whirl3d> so you need a function that builds your form each time.
[01:26:40] <jarray52> more or less, yes.
[01:26:53] <jarray52> However, that is done with jquery.reveal.
[01:27:06] <Whirl3d> how specific are you being with your $(element).dateINput() method?
[01:27:20] <Whirl3d> in other words, is it possible that "editing" the form disables your selector??
[01:27:51] <Whirl3d> if the form is new, its like this:    .newform .somefields input.datefield    for example.
[01:27:59] <Whirl3d> then on submit, it hides the form
[01:28:26] <jarray52> Whirl3d: I checked for that.
[01:28:30] <Whirl3d> then edit changes it to .editform .sofields input.datefield (which no longer works )
[01:28:55] <jarray52> Whirl3d: That is not the case. I tried a really specific class that is not used anywhere else. And, I have the same problem.
[01:29:18] <Whirl3d> have you considered usuing jqueryUI datePicker instead? LOL
[01:29:20] <jarray52> I inspected the html. The class name does not change.
[01:29:56] <Whirl3d> I am plum out of ideas without seeing the code.
[01:30:07] <Whirl3d> we tried a lot of things, though.
[01:30:21] <jarray52> It's very hard to debug code without having it in front of you.
[01:30:26] <jarray52> Thanks for trying.
[01:31:02] <Whirl3d> sorry I couldn't solve it for you. It's gonna be something simple and we are gonna be like, "WTF? why didn't we see that" LOL
[01:31:02] <jarray52> I will try to create a simplified example that demonstrates the problems. That will take several hours though.
[01:31:25] <Whirl3d> several hours? for a one page form?
[01:31:41] <jarray52> I've been working on this for probably 3 full days now.
[01:31:51] <jarray52> I've simplified the problem.
[01:31:57] <jarray52> But still haven't solved it.
[01:32:15] <jarray52> Learned a lot about event handling in the process.
[01:32:38] <Whirl3d> sounds like me and my probem getting a straight answer about ajax and wordpress....uggh
[01:32:58] <jarray52> Several hours cause I have to strip out everything that isn't related to the problem.
[01:33:19] <jarray52> The problem is embedded inside a rails application. So, I need to take out the rails.
[01:33:50] <jarray52> Leaving just the html and javascript and the relevant libraries that are absolutely required to reproduce the problem.
[01:34:40] <jarray52> That's why it will take several hours.
[01:35:05] <Whirl3d> never touched rails, so I wouldn't have a clue what all is involved. Good luck. I will likely be lurking on here, so I'll check on ya later.
[02:11:50] <peterxixon> buenos dias
[02:12:22] <peterxixon> alguien me podria decir como agrego plugins jquery en drupal
[02:21:00] <ph88> how that effect done with the vertical SHARE bar at the left ? http://www.kidpreneurs.org/
[02:24:47] <pixelpimp> http://wordpress.org/plugins/slick-social-share-buttons/
[02:25:01] <pixelpimp> just look at the source; it was in there
[02:28:06] <Es0teric> i want to send an ajax post request on first click and if the user clicks again on the same element, i want to send an ajax delete request.. how would i go about doing that?
[02:59:32] <Bauer> guys, I have problem with this piece of code: $('#ic_vCloudCheckbox').click( SpecialToggle ("vcloud") ); - it gets executed on load :( and the function is called, instead of being called only on click.. I cant figure out why
[03:07:37] <ph88> pixelpimp:  i don't want to buttons, just the nice box effect !
[03:08:35] <pixelpimp> Bauer: you are telling it to call the function, not to set a callback of that function.  you need to insert the call into an anonymous function so it doesn't get called right away
[03:09:05] <pixelpimp> $('#ic_v...').click(function () { specialToggle('vCloud'); });
[03:10:23] <Bauer> pixelpimp: ahh, thanks! I suspected it has something to do with that.. but its very confusing, there are cases where you only put a function name like function, other cases you have to write function(), and now you are saying its via anonimous function...
[03:10:39] <Bauer> are there any other methods I should be aware of?
[03:10:42] <Bauer> or differences?
[03:12:29] <pixelpimp> here's a better example of the difference: assume specialToggle() doesn't take any arguments (as there'd be no way to pass them).  calling .click(specialTogle) will work, because it's going to execute the function you sent it.  setting .click(specialToggle()) is going to call specialToggle() and then set its return value as the .click() callback
[03:12:43] <anew> http://www.givainc.com/labs/mcdropdown_jquery_plugin.htm
[03:12:47] <anew> anyonen know an alternative to this ?
[03:12:50] <anew> cant find one anywhere
[03:23:15] <Bauer> pixelpimp: thanks, exactly.. so why does calling .click(specialTogle) work according to one standard (not requiring anonymous function, while doing the same thing with parameters, requires anonym func?
[03:23:47] <pixelpimp> because otherwise you're calling the function
[03:23:51] <pixelpimp> not givin the name of the funtion
[03:24:36] <Bauer> ahh, ok.. but thats not comfortable having to wrap with yet another function.. the code becomes even more cluttered and harder to read
[03:24:46] <pixelpimp> true
[03:25:06] <pixelpimp> you can use a named function, you just can't call it right away
[03:27:05] <Bauer> pixelpimp: another question.. turns out I need to change the way it works a bit, how do I pass the object itself to the function from inside the .click? so that the function could check object properties and based on that decide what to do
[03:27:19] <pixelpimp> $(this)
[03:28:32] <Bauer> I mean the object from the jquery selector, not object class
[03:29:20] <pixelpimp> not sure what you mean
[03:31:22] <Bauer> pixelpimp: the selected object is an image element in HTML, how do I pass it to the called SpecialToggle function? so that it could check an attribute of the element called aria-checked="true" whetehr its true or false
[03:31:34] <Bauer> I cant pass that dynamically from the .click
[03:35:43] <pixelpimp> it's $(this) inside your function
[03:37:37] <Bauer> oh, I dont need to specifically pass it to it? well, looking on debug inside $(this), it seems to be the big object, how do I find the element which was sent by .click inside the big $(this)?
[03:43:00] <pixelpimp> it'll be $(this) inside the first scope, i.e. the anonymous function: http://jsfiddle.net/MWs2E/
[03:45:07] <Bauer> ohhh, very nice pixelpimp! its even simpler than what I was trying to do just a sec before :)
[03:45:21] <Bauer> I could actually pass the true/false value to the toggle function :)
[03:45:23] <Bauer> thanks!
[03:45:48] <pixelpimp> no problem
[03:49:54] <Bauer> pixelpimp: uhm, its not working quite yet: $('#ic_vCloudCheckbox').click( function (elem) { SpecialToggle('vCloud', $(this).attr('aria-checked')); } ); I get error Unexpected token )
[03:50:04] <Bauer> but all the brackets match.. no exess brackets
[03:51:58] <pixelpimp> don't see a syntax error there myself
[03:53:24] <Bauer> you are right, was old uncleared error left on page refresh.. silly of me
[03:57:44] <AlVal> I have an api which responds with json in this format http://pastebin.com/U4DYgQsm
[03:58:04] <AlVal> I simply want to call this json from the api and display it as a simple html list
[03:59:47] <AlVal> my latest attempt is at: http://pastebin.com/1cVCMG5P
[04:03:04] <shoky> AlVal: data is an object, not an array. you probably want $.each(data.data, ...)     (or better yet $.map because you're making a new array)
[04:05:16] <AlVal> shoky: thanks a lot for the pointer
[04:07:20] <AlVal> I'm jumping in at the deep end I guess. only have basic html knowledge. how much would it cost to get someone to do me a really simple working script?
[04:18:05] <gameboy> on jquery i have var x = 'this is sparta' how can i extract "is sparta" from var x ?
[04:18:08] <gameboy> thanks
[04:19:48] <dabear> gameboy: so what are the possible values of x?
[04:21:23] <pixelpimp> possibly as easy as removing the first 5 letters
[04:34:21] <sunbeam> i'm looking for a good example site on which the viewer can change text (on a t-shirt) live with HTML5
[04:34:33] <sunbeam> and size, colors, etc of this
[04:34:35] <sunbeam> any ideas?
[05:49:07] <yousaf> hi all
[05:49:12] <yousaf> anyone here using Google Analytics?
[06:04:58] <rgr> whats the proper way to select if the fields (inpur or textarea) contain no text?
[06:05:35] <rgr> oh found it
[06:22:20] <jim87> hello! I don't understand why element.outerHeight() always return the same number instead of changing depending on its real height... demo: http://jsfiddle.net/7kA86/2/
[06:23:15] <yousaf> anyone?
[06:33:37] <yousaf> I need to hook into a Google Analytics UI function, basically when you change a date in Google Analytics and it redraws the graphs accordingly, how can I hook into that event?
[06:42:54] <raj> shoky?
[06:44:37] <daslicht> whats the best way to get files from a form to be able to post them ?
[06:45:00] <daslicht> i tried it with    var formData = new FormData($('#myForm'));
[06:45:08] <daslicht> but that sems not to be correct
[06:46:26] <raj> daslicht, jquery-fileupload plugin
[06:46:40] <daslicht> i like to learn how it works
[06:47:49] <raj> that I'm not sure
[06:49:22] <daslicht> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/uploading-files-with-ajax/
[06:49:25] <daslicht> i am trying this now
[06:53:00] <jp-> daslicht, try calling submit on the form object instead.
[06:53:37] <jp-> or are you trying to an ajax file upload?
[06:53:40] <daslicht> yes
[06:54:02] <daslicht> submit will not be ajax no?
[06:54:24] <jp-> there several ways to do it, one is to post to a hidden iframe. another is to use the newer javascript objects for working with files.
[06:54:37] <daslicht> yeh I want xhr2
[06:54:44] <daslicht> but I need to get the files somehow :)
[06:55:04] <jp-> give me a second, i've done it and i've got code… just need to dig it out.
[06:55:10] <daslicht> cool
[06:55:14] <daslicht> thank you
[06:57:37] <jp-> Here's a working example i just pulled from some code using xhr2: xhr.send(new FormData(document.getElementById(settings.form)));
[06:57:51] <jp-> the difference from yours is that $("#foo") returns a jquery object
[06:58:02] <jp-> FormData is a native JS object
[06:58:54] <jp-> it might not like the object jquery returns, mine is just calling plain jain document.getElementById() to retrieve the form.
[06:59:04] <jp-> *plain jane
[06:59:40] <daslicht> ok
[07:00:05] <daslicht> i try :)
[07:00:34] <daslicht> is xhr.send native js ?
[07:01:09] <jp-> yes, the code I'm looking at is not jquery with the exception is a jquery plugin i wrote for this specific site, but it warps raw xhr objects.
[07:01:17] <daslicht> https://gist.github.com/daslicht/30e93dc8d9adfa44b467
[07:01:24] <jp-> *wraps
[07:01:41] <daslicht> can i use somehow $.ajax to send that form ?
[07:01:48] <daslicht> data: ???
[07:01:54] <jp-> i assume so, i haven't done it that way.
[07:02:02] <jp-> would have to some googlin'
[07:02:07] <jp-> *to do some
[07:02:15] <daslicht> I am on that since hours
[07:02:17] <daslicht> :)
[07:02:26] <daslicht> quite confusing
[07:02:34] <daslicht> soem suggest to just serialize teh form
[07:02:42] <jp-> yeah, i was about to say that
[07:02:49] <jp-> $("#form).serialize()
[07:02:50] <daslicht> will formdata include all data in teh form ?
[07:03:04] <daslicht> $("#form).serialize() will not anything here
[07:03:47] <daslicht> https://gist.github.com/optikalefx/4504947
[07:03:50] <daslicht> i also foudn this
[07:04:18] <daslicht> but I am not to sure wherer this points to here: formData.append($(this).attr("name"), $(this)[0].files[0]);
[07:04:22] <jp-> is your form's enctype set?
[07:04:36] <daslicht>  enctype="multipart/form-data"
[07:05:37] <jp-> ah well, don't know, like i said, i haven't done it with a jquery ajax object, just raw xhr.
[07:05:52] <daslicht> I tried something like :
[07:05:53] <daslicht>      console.log( document.getElementById('myForm').files )
[07:05:57] <daslicht> but its undefined
[07:06:27] <daslicht> do you have a working example somewhere with raw js ?
[07:06:28] <jp-> that guys reference to files is from a jquery object
[07:06:54] <jp-> there's a big difference in using $("#foo") and document.getElemtnById("foo").
[07:09:39] <daslicht> ok I tried it liek this now:
[07:09:45] <daslicht> https://gist.github.com/daslicht/ac2bc162a1dc14f53d3d
[07:10:00] <daslicht> /rte/ (Zeile 119)
[07:10:01] <daslicht> TypeError: Value does not implement interface FormData.
[07:10:01] <daslicht> 	
[07:10:02] <daslicht> ...er("ajaxComplete",[C,p]),--x.active||x.event.trigger("ajaxStop")))}return C},get...
[07:10:04] <daslicht> jquery....min.js (Zeile 6)
[07:10:08] <daslicht> thats what i get
[07:10:53] <daslicht> i try to use the native object
[07:10:54] <daslicht> :)
[07:11:46] <jp-> Here's mine: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2329927/jqueryupload.js
[07:12:03] <jp-> requires jquery-ui because it shows a modal dialog with a progress bar.
[07:13:06] <jp-> $.doUpload({url: "form-post.url", form: "name_of_file_form", complete: function() { }, cancel: function() { }});
[07:13:49] <jp-> it's from some dev code, use at your own risk. :)
[07:13:59] <daslicht> I managed to make teh native xhr work
[07:14:13] <daslicht> cool thanks
[07:14:28] <daslicht> ok , next step : progression events
[07:17:15] <daslicht> sendiong additional parameters seams not to work :/
[07:18:04] <Jinxed-> So I'm new to jquery and for my first project am working on a weighted lottery draft page (Selects order for a draft based on weight). I have most of it working but I thought it would be nice to have something pop up when a name is selected with their name and maybe a picture and then disappear... any suggestions?
[07:18:18] <Jinxed-> I was hoping for something like an alert that would float above the page
[07:22:25] <daslicht> hmm now i can upload files but can send additional data
[07:22:37] <daslicht> eg if i add a hidden field i cant find it in teh req on my server
[07:30:39] <jp-> daslicht, the code i posted includes hidden fields in the project i'm using it and it most definitely sends all of the forms fields with the upload.
[07:31:48] <jp-> so dunno, don't know why your FormData() object wouldn't include all fields on the form because it should unless your fields in question are outside of the form.
[07:38:07] <daslicht> yeh its something with my node backend
[07:41:41] <daslicht> lol i either manage to get the post variables or the file :/
[07:51:11] <jim87> how can I find a direct child of an element (this)?
[07:55:41] <dabear> jim87: .children() or .find(">div")
[08:02:09] <jim87> thanks dabear :)
[08:03:50] <jim87> btw... I've finished my work, but still got a question: I'm splitting an HTML string by spaces, but I'd like to avoid splitting inner HTML tags with that method (it would break the HTML). How can I split an HTML string by space and by tag?
[08:04:46] <jim87> this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/WfAaV/1/ - btw a higher-than-container image would lead to an infinite loop... any idea?
[08:10:22] <rgr> can one use a jquery dialog() without it actually "popping up" - rather just providing its nice rendering "in place" where the old form was we're wrapping in the dialog styles?
[08:14:20] <jim87> rgr: first of all, dialog() is not part of jQuery, but of jQueryUI. Secondly, you could try showing it with no effect in show().
[08:26:45] <jop008> how to get al selectbox on a page (with a wildcard?)
[08:36:13] <jim87> jop008: $.find("select").each(function () { ... });
[08:37:39] <jim87> jop008: or $(document), don't really remember
[09:01:33] <jop008> Can I use this safely on my site getElementsByTagNames?
[09:01:55] <jop008> works in all common browsers?
[09:06:48] <SuRfDeMoN> Anyone got any ideas why data-role="listview" on <ul> would not take affect ?
[09:07:26] <SuRfDeMoN> http://pastebin.com/RUzj1CKD
[09:10:20] <Tingle> how do I set an element invisible? this doesnt seem to want to work:
[09:10:20] <Tingle> $('body div.login_bg').visibility='hidden';
[09:10:59] <Tingle> this is the whole thing: http://hastebin.com/canokowajo.vhdl
[09:11:04] <Tingle> maybe I'm doing it wrong
[09:11:37] <jp-> .hide()
[09:11:49] <jp-> .css("visibility", "hidden")
[09:11:57] <jp-> depending on what you're wanting to do.
[09:12:18] <Tingle> .css("visibility", "hidden") is what I wanted :D
[09:12:18] <Tingle> thx
[09:12:27] <jp-> np
[09:12:46] <Tingle> mm doesnt work :/
[09:12:53] <Tingle> I think I setup something wrong
[09:13:02] <Tingle> is the way Im getting my element wrong?
[09:13:26] <Tingle> `http://hastebin.com/kejehutevu.coffee
[09:14:31] <jp-> i don't see an obvious problem with the code, hard to say anything without seeing your markup that goes with it.
[09:15:01] <Tingle> http://hastebin.com/caquradepa.xml,
[09:15:06] <Tingle> inside a body ofc
[09:16:00] <Tingle> and my css is body div.login_form input.cancleButton{ } and that works
[09:16:18] <Tingle> or is the class path differnt in js
[09:19:00] <jp-> that should be click() not onclick()
[09:19:30] <Tingle> ah yeah
[09:19:31] <Tingle> just saw it
[09:19:33] <Tingle> thx
[09:38:00] <NCS_One> hi
[09:39:47] <NCS_One> is it bad practice to send a function name has a html element attribute, like: "<a data-function="functionName" ..."?
[09:40:14] <Tingle> question about form/input stuff... what is the theory behind filling out a form, submitting it, but the page not reloading  - but instead it checks if the data is correct and if not, it says like wrong password. how is that achieved without reloading the page?
[09:41:06] <NCS_One> Tingle: validate the form data using javascript or ajax to validate on server side
[09:42:35] <NCS_One> Tingle: never used this but take alook: http://rickharrison.github.io/validate.js/
[09:45:05] <Tingle> hmm i dont understand how that would work, itcant like  connect to the database and check the password o.O
[09:45:11] <Tingle> its js whihc is clientside
[09:45:17] <jp-> $.ajax({url: "auth-user.whatever", data: $("#login-form").serialize(), type: "post", dataType: "json", success: function(data) { /* process returned json object to determine if user is logged in */ }});
[09:45:48] <jp-> auth-user.whatever connects to the database and validates the user and sends a json encoded response back to the client.
[09:47:28] <Tingle> mmm never messed with ajax
[09:47:42] <jp-> of course you can customzie the data types to whatever you want, i just chose json because it's easy.
[09:50:28] <Tingle> so i dont use a form submit tag...?
[09:51:09] <Tingle> nvm i see
[09:51:13] <NCS_One> Tingle: you use it
[09:51:14] <jp-> you'd override the form submit() function with your ajax call.
[09:51:41] <NCS_One> but you get the form submit with ajax and prevent its normal submit
[09:51:44] <Tingle> basicly instead of a action="file.php" I use a action="file.asp" for example
[09:51:56] <NCS_One> /ajax/javascript
[09:52:04] <Tingle> k
[09:52:54] <Tingle> as post or get method?
[09:53:31] <NCS_One> Tingle: $('#myFormID').on('submit', function() {// do what ever you need; return false});
[09:53:54] <jp-> you should post login forms
[09:53:57] <alx-> is there a way to unbind events from the document that have specific selectors? i need to do something like this: $(document).unbind("click",".js-unbind");
[09:53:58] <NCS_One> the "return false prevents the normal form submit
[09:54:18] <jp-> if you use get the form fields will be encoded in the url and thus logged.
[09:54:39] <Tingle> I can just use <form action="login.ajax" method="post">, no need to catch anything?
[09:54:47] <NCS_One> alx-: "off()"
[09:54:58] <alx-> NCS_One: thanks!
[09:55:07] <_guest> hi can someone tell me the best way to store two types of data? ex. people are supposed to rate a series of movies so they have 3 textboxes to put the title and 3 to put a number rating. The title and rating need to be able to be separated (use # here but not title, etc.)?
[09:57:50] <Tingle> Im just reading here, that javascript/ajax is clientside... how am I suppose to do stuff on the server/db? also if iM not loading a new page, what target should go into the action field?
[09:57:54] <alx-> how about removing all the events?   $(document).off(".js-unbind") doesn't seem to work
[09:58:45] <NCS_One> Tingle: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:59:53] <NCS_One> alx-: selector is required
[10:00:05] <NCS_One> sorry
[10:00:11] <NCS_One> event is requerid
[10:00:17] <_guest> Kambfhase you helped me yesterday with the array I was wondering one more thing right now
[10:00:19] <alx-> ok thanks!
[10:00:30] <Kambfhase> yeah?
[10:00:39] <_guest> can you tell me the best way to store two types of data? ex. people are supposed to rate a series of movies so they have 3 textboxes to put the title and 3 to put a number rating. The title and rating need to be able to be separated (use # here but not title, etc.)?
[10:01:04] <_guest> I am storing the titles in an array right now
[10:01:20] <NCS_One> alx-: or not, reading it again
[10:01:48] <NCS_One> _guest: store where?
[10:01:51] <Kambfhase> you could either just have two arrays.
[10:02:04] <Kambfhase> or use one array and will it with objects
[10:02:18] <_guest> I dont know what you mean
[10:03:04] <_guest> what about .data would that have any use here?(i dont understand it all the way)
[10:05:06] <jp-> NCS_One, http://jsfiddle.net/C7EgT/
[10:06:28] <_guest> ok the array and objects seem to be what i need
[10:07:24] <_guest> would you be able to direct me to a documentation page on this subject?
[10:08:13] <NCS_One> jp-: seems correct
[10:08:15] <_guest> nevermind i have found one
[10:08:32] <jp-> sorry, that was for Tingle
[10:08:39] <jp-> didn't mean to address you NCS_One :)
[10:08:55] <Tingle> cool thanks
[10:09:10] <Tingle> what does asp stand for
[10:09:13] <Tingle> ajax code?
[10:09:30] <jp-> no, you said login.asp so i just used it in the example.
[10:09:32] <NCS_One> jp-: now on "login.asp" check if the request ajax and if soo send the respnose as an json obj
[10:09:51] <jp-> it's the server side script that authenticates the login credentials.
[10:10:09] <jp-> i could be asp, php, or whatever server side scripting language you're using.
[10:10:13] <NCS_One> jp-: and what language is it writen?
[10:10:20] <Tingle> and where is the server side code executed?
[10:10:33] <jp-> man i give up.
[10:10:52] <jp-> going to fix some coffee and move on with my day, good luck. :)
[10:11:26] <NCS_One> Tingle: to what page is the form submited?
[10:11:38] <Tingle> i suppose login.ajax
[10:11:48] <NCS_One> you suppose?
[10:11:55] <Tingle> havent done it yet, still trying to understand where goes what
[10:12:03] <NCS_One> you don't have it done for normal submit?
[10:12:17] <jp-> maybe you should start with a basic form that just does a normal post back to the server and then try to wrap your head around ajax.
[10:12:36] <Tingle> I understand normal forms
[10:12:38] <NCS_One> jp-: agree with jp-
[10:12:51] <Tingle> and I understand client/server talk
[10:13:07] <jp-> well that's all this is Tingle, it's posting your form back to the server using XMLHttpRequest under the hood.
[10:13:47] <Tingle> yes, but this is missing the serve side stuff
[10:14:07] <Tingle> that ajax() function seems to only be a request
[10:14:10] <Tingle> where is the backend to that
[10:14:19] <Tingle> where the message is recieved
[10:14:27] <jp-> you write the back-end yourself.
[10:14:33] <Tingle> and server code can be executed
[10:15:13] <Tingle> yes, but where
[10:15:30] * jp- wanders off
[10:15:30] <Tingle> $.ajax() has a error and success function callback
[10:15:33] <jp-> later on
[10:15:48] <Tingle> that callback needs to be triggered by the server somehow
[10:15:51] <Tingle> thats what I mean
[10:19:34] <Tingle> ah now I get it
[10:21:58] <Tingle> so do I just do <form action="#" method="post"> and intercept my submit input over js to then execute the ajax function?
[10:22:21] <NCS_One> right, like on the jp- fiddle
[10:22:57] <NCS_One> the "success" and "error" functions are not if login is successfull or not
[10:23:17] <NCS_One> its if the ajax request was successfull or not
[10:23:45] <Tingle> but the fiddel uses <form action="login.asp"...
[10:24:09] <NCS_One> then call what ever file you use to d the login
[10:24:22] <Tingle> but that would reload the page
[10:24:24] <Tingle> o.O
[10:24:32] <Tingle> and I thought im calling that file over the ajax function
[10:26:08] <NCS_One> if you have the "return false;" and there are no js errors it should not reload the page
[10:26:25] <Tingle> ah k
[10:28:03] <Tingle> oh ok
[10:28:09] <Tingle> so it doesnt realy matter which file I put in there
[10:28:37] <Tingle> k thanks, Ill mess around with it
[10:28:49] <jp-> it would probably go a long way to read this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:31:45] <scar> looking at this example, i see the text does not wrap on the meme generator-- just gets really tiny. any way to make it better? http://jsfiddle.net/ralphholzmann/yCX24/1/
[10:33:25] <ralphholzmann> lol scar wat
[10:33:29] <ralphholzmann> I wrote that a loooong time ago
[10:33:41] <scar> yeah i was looking up html5 canvas
[10:33:50] <scar> to see how it worked, and saw your memegen with filltext, etc
[10:34:07] <scar> haha
[10:34:59] <scar> well, any way to get your filltext to line-wrap?
[10:35:20] <scar> i typed a long message and it just got real tiny on 1 line
[10:35:25] <ralphholzmann> heh, idk
[10:35:44] <ralphholzmann> augment the function to work across two lines
[10:35:48] <ralphholzmann> i guess
[10:35:54] <ralphholzmann> split on ("\n")
[10:36:00] <ralphholzmann> draw them independently
[10:36:02] <scar> based on character letters?
[10:36:30] <scar> i imagine i see how many chars fit per line in the smallest size i like, and then use that to split for say 2-3 line per top/bottom
[10:37:22] <ralphholzmann> it'd be simple enough to do something like
[10:37:30] <ralphholzmann> if the string is more than 20 characters (for example)
[10:37:37] <ralphholzmann> split the line into words
[10:37:50] <ralphholzmann> and put all words that appear after 20 chars onto a second line
[10:38:06] <ralphholzmann> sounds like a fun exercise
[10:40:59] <scar> sounds like a pain
[10:41:00] <scar> either way
[10:41:14] <scar> how difficult is it to say add a line to the bottom of an image, with a small logo aligned right?
[10:41:28] <scar> so prob draw a black rectangle then add an image with it on top to the right
[10:41:55] <scar> i have literally no experience w canvas. your fiddle was my first example to look at lol
[10:42:29] <NCS_One> is it good practice to call a function from a string?
[10:42:45] <NCS_One> /good/bad
[10:43:17] <scar> call a function from a tring?
[10:43:24] <scar> concatination?
[10:43:49] <scar> i'd imagine storing that process into a var, then using the var with the string would be better
[10:45:13] <NCS_One> scar: var fun = "myfunction";    then do "eval(myfunction());"
[10:45:20] <NCS_One> something like that
[10:45:46] <NCS_One> damn
[10:46:00] <NCS_One> then do "eval(fun());"
[10:48:15] <Kambfhase> eval is evil
[10:49:45] <scar> eval is evil with a southern accent
[10:51:00] <Kambfhase> Why would you ever want to call a function from a string, anyways?
[10:54:54] <NCS_One> Kambfhase: I have a page with a 3 forms the forms are submited using ajax, this can be the same function to all of them but each one have a different function to be called after the ajax
[10:55:39] <Kambfhase> var fun = myfunction; /* later */ fun();
[10:55:45] <Kambfhase> its as simple as that
[10:57:06] <NCS_One> thanks
[10:57:39] <NCS_One> but its a bad practice? should I avoid it?
[10:59:44] <Kambfhase> yes, avoid eval, and Function()
[11:02:36] <tw2113> avoid them like evil ex's
[11:02:55] <Kambfhase> Wollt ihr das totale evil?
[11:09:56] <rgr> using the valdation plugin I might have a input field like <input class="blah" type="email" required> : in this instance is the "required" bit a property or an attribute and how would I go about setting/removing it in jquery (it seems attr) needs to set a value).
[11:11:17] <Kambfhase> try .removeAttr()
[11:11:51] <rgr> I dont want to just remove it. I want to set/unset it too.
[11:12:58] <horsik> why does everyone use " instead of ' in js
[11:13:01] <rgr> just glancing up at "Why would you ever want to call a function from a string" - because its a very common thing to do in a meat data based framework.
[11:13:11] <rgr> s/meat/meta
[11:13:13] <horsik> this is so annoying
[11:13:42] <rgr> because it means different things for things like string expansion with suc as \n in it
[11:13:56] <tw2113> i tend to default to single quote. looks less cluttered or some other more valid reason i can't think of
[11:14:08] <horsik> rgr: there's no difference
[11:14:14] <rgr> yes there is
[11:14:20] <horsik> it's not php
[11:14:32] <rgr> noting to do with php. Im talking about js
[11:15:09] <rgr> try alert('hello\nthere');
[11:15:14] <rgr> and then with double quotes.
[11:16:00] <Kambfhase> rgr: no difference.
[11:16:45] <horsik> there's no difference dude at least you could check on so
[11:17:08] <rgr> there was from within my js code. not in the evaluator. shrug.
[11:17:17] <tw2113> maybe single vs double quotes in js is a preference only thing
[11:17:30] <rgr> but good to be aware it can be an issue.
[11:18:15] <tw2113> i'd be more irritated by inconsitent use in the same script file
[11:18:19] <Kambfhase> no, " and ' are semantically the very same
[11:18:46] <rgr> tw2113: agreed
[11:18:46] <Kambfhase> SCHLEICHWERBUNG
[11:19:17] <horsik> tw2113: i'm pissed when i copy paste a part of code and i have these damn double quotes
[11:19:20] <rgr> they are not semantically the same. They are syntactically the same. They are treated diferently in certain library functions-
[11:19:20] <horsik> i hate them
[11:19:22] <Kambfhase> meh, wrong channel :S
[11:19:31] <rgr> anyways . see ya
[11:20:00] <tw2113> like i said, probably a case of preference
[11:35:28] <scar> is it possible to draw an image on top of the image used on an html5 canvas? lol
[11:41:42] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[11:45:08] <shoky> raj?
[12:08:20] <scar> when im adding text to a canvas how can i get a bg color on that text
[12:25:16] <bklane> When i submit a form with jquery in rails using the .submit method it seems to be trying to submit the same form mutliple times, how can i prevent this? I have read some stuff on bind/unbind but unsure how I would implement it.
[12:27:53] <Croves> Hi folks! I have a var elements = $('#mySelect'). I need to get all the <option> inside that var and put it into a $.each(). I'm doing $(elements_selected + 'option').each(function() {});, but It's not working… there's a error Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object Object]option
[12:27:58] <Croves> Any idea ?
[12:28:23] <Kambfhase> ?children @Croves
[12:28:55] <Kambfhase> $('#mySelect').children().each(function(){ /* whatever*/ })
[12:30:03] <Croves> Kambfhase that's perfect
[12:30:06] <Croves> Thank you! =)
[12:30:10] <Kambfhase> np
[12:31:32] <HAPPYFUNBALL> how would I go about using .slideDown() to reveal hidden elements?
[12:34:16] <billybob_> is it possible to put an array inside of an array and the access it like company[1].users[2].name? this would access Company 1 and then User 1's name??
[12:34:29] <Kambfhase> yyes
[12:34:29] <billybob_> *User 2's
[12:34:36] <Kambfhase> that is valid
[12:34:44] <billybob_> is it just that simple?
[12:35:01] <Kambfhase> yeah, but beware of 0 indexing ;)
[12:35:14] <billybob_> how does the browser know that name is = ??
[12:35:21] <billybob_> and what is 0 indexing
[12:35:33] <trinode> has anyone created a function that builds a popup dialog to replace alert() and doesn't rely on html being in the page (completely dynamic)?
[12:35:54] <trinode> I feel like I'm banging my head on the desk reinventing the wheel
[12:36:02] <Kambfhase> var array = [ 'Alice', 'bob']; /* to get Alice, do: */ array[0]
[12:36:03] <billybob_> I have made somethink like that. one sec
[12:36:15] <billybob_> ok
[12:36:21] <billybob_> thats simple
[12:36:23] <jp-> trinode, i have using jquery-ui's dialog
[12:36:47] <trinode> I've only got JQM and JQ available to me
[12:37:09] <mahal|cze> hi all
[12:37:09] <billybob_> i was going to get the code for you trinode but that was made b4 my hard drive crash :(
[12:37:21] <jp-> ah well, suppose it's been done with straight up jquery before.
[12:37:26] <trinode> no worries
[12:37:43] <jp-> i'm sure googling would turn up plenty of replacements for alert and confirm that don't require on jquery ui
[12:39:19] <Kambfhase> trinode: google for 'light box'
[12:39:47] <trinode> that almost seems excessive
[12:39:57] <trinode> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/docs/widgets/popup/#&ui-state=dialog
[12:40:12] <trinode> ^ that's my aim, something similar
[12:40:44] <trinode> and this is my failed effort

[12:42:43] <bklane> When i submit a form with jquery in rails using the .submit method it seems to be trying to submit the same form mutliple times, how can i prevent this? I have read some stuff on bind/unbind but unsure how I would implement it.
[12:44:48] <mahal|cze> Hi everybody, could someone give me an advice regarding styled buttons inside accordion ?
[12:45:23] <shoky> bklane: if you're doing an ajax submit you'll wanna preventDefault() on the event argument in the submit handler. no idea if that's what you mean tho
[12:45:34] <mahal|cze> buttons have style and icons only in first row of accoridion, not in the others.
[12:45:41] <bklane> shoky: this is the gist https://gist.github.com/blklane/b24b0ec5bbbd8c260d99
[12:46:22] <billybob_> kambfhase from what you told me i understand I must use company[1].user[2].ALICE to access Alice. I would like to do company[1].user[2].NAME to return Alice and company[1].user[2].PHONE to return Alice's phone number? will this work?
[12:47:21] <Kambfhase> that should work, if you create you objects correctly, yes.
[12:47:33] <ravenzz> bklane you should cache your dom queries
[12:48:01] <ravenzz> eg var elem = $('.foo'); elem.doSomething(); elem.doSomethingElse();
[12:48:16] <shoky> bklane: sry donno rails.. i know it can do shit with ajax/forms for you. what makes you say it's submitting multiple times
[12:48:52] <bklane> shoky: just unsure where to attach preventDefault() to
[12:49:01] <bklane> ravenzz: thank you, will do
[12:49:16] <billybob_> by objects do you mean: function car(make,type,color){this make=make; this type=type; this color=color}??
[12:49:24] <ravenzz> does jQuery emulates event bubbling for the submit event?
[12:49:48] <shoky> bklane: is that .past_card_payment a button in a form?
[12:49:57] <bklane> shoky: yes
[12:50:04] <bklane> reload the gist i put it in
[12:50:44] <billybob_> if so how would i add to the array
[12:50:57] <shoky> bklane: then it should be a submit button, and you should handle the form's submit event, not the button's click event
[12:51:33] <ravenzz> seems so, nice
[12:51:51] <bklane> shoky: even if it triggers a data id to be set for a input value
[12:52:05] <billybob_> would i use: company[1].user[2] = (Alice, <phone #>);
[12:52:38] <Kambfhase> billybob_: to create an object go { "name": "Alice", "phone":"+44 00", "age": 34}
[12:52:52] <shoky> bklane: sure
[12:53:05] <billybob_> ok
[12:53:51] <Kambfhase> billybob_: read this: http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter4.html
[12:54:04] <billybob_> ok tahnks
[12:54:10] <billybob_> *thanks
[12:55:06] <clime> how can I get z-index value with jquery as a number? $(elem).css('z-index') sometimes returns not-numeric values.
[12:55:36] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[12:58:11] <clime> i would need something like this: http://api.jqueryui.com/zIndex/ I guess
[12:58:41] <clime> not too eager to add ui as a dependency, perhaps ill try to extract the code from ui
[13:02:50] <mahal|cze> got it
[13:02:51] <mahal|cze> $( "input:submit, button", ".buttonsDel" ).button({ icons: {primary: 'ui-icon-trash'}}).next().button({ icons: {primary: "ui-icon-pencil"}});
[13:02:54] <mahal|cze> thanks anyway
[13:14:56] <billybob_> kambfhase sorry to bother you again but i was wonder if there was a reason as to why this would not work?...
[13:15:09] <billybob_> user[num] = { "name": +name, "phone": +phone};    company[1] = user[num];   alert(company[1].user[num].name);
[13:15:32] <Kambfhase> company is undefined?!
[13:15:54] <billybob_> one sec i will check
[13:16:05] <Kambfhase> and +name is probably not what you intend to do.
[13:16:39] <billybob_> i want to input the value of a textbox there
[13:17:07] <billybob_> i do have var company = [];
[13:18:12] <Kambfhase> what error do you get?
[13:18:28] <billybob_> i didnt get anything
[13:18:53] <billybob_> i will try again
[13:19:54] <billybob_> here Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'issue' of undefined
[13:20:11] <Kambfhase> mkay, fix it.
[13:20:12] <billybob_> opps wrong one
[13:21:02] <billybob_> ok ill try
[13:24:27] <billybob_> i fi make it user[num].name instead of company[1].user[num].name (nothing but that error happens)  i get a alert that says NaN but nothing in the console
[13:25:32] <billybob_> so company is undefined?? if so how would i fix that?
[13:28:48] <billybob_> you said before +name is not what i would want, what should i put there instead because it does look as if there is nothing in the name object
[13:29:06] <SuRfDeMoN> I'm loading li's with data out of a local db, on the page they don't appear to have listview styling, I think this is to do with when they are being added to the page and think that I need to run .listview("refresh") on the ul but not sure where to put this, anyone know how to do this ?
[13:30:10] <billybob_> would you not just put the listview script after the database load script (just a guess)
[13:33:04] <SuRfDeMoN> billybob_: http://pastebin.com/a4ZxiSiv that is the code that I'm using if I put $('#list').viewlist("refresh"); at the end of it before the last }); it doesn't says that it can't do it
[13:45:29] <Croves> Hey guys, in my page I have a form, and inside this form I have a search field, where the user type the product name and hit "enter" to add this product to a <select> list. The problem is, when the user is searching for the product in the search field, when he hits "enter", the form is submited
[13:45:33] <Croves> Any idea how to solve this?
[13:45:55] <Croves> I tryied if (keypress == 13) return false in the .submit(), but not woring
[13:49:47] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[14:05:57] <Technical_13> Can I get the os version with jQuery in browsers other than Firefox?
[14:06:12] <Technical_13> If so, how?
[14:14:41] <sunbeam> whats the best jquery plugin / way to have a ul li a menu convert to a <select> dropdown menu you see on many responsive sites?
[14:28:12] <Fusl> heya... i'm looking for a plugin where i can draw points and connect them to each other, like on this map: https://thefinn93.com/cjdns/map/map.svg
[14:28:17] <Fusl> does anyone know of such a plugin?
[14:29:09] <doug65536> Fusl: http://blag.oztechninja.com/post/25699330571/simple-svg-manipulation-with-jquery ?
[14:29:40] <doug65536> the title is misleading, it should be, "jquery can't manipulate svg, but here's a workaround"
[14:30:02] <Fusl> yeah but thats not what i'm looking for
[14:30:24] <doug65536> Fusl: sure it is. you want to create points and lines
[14:30:47] <Fusl> i'm looking for something like "here you go: point a, point b, point c, point d" "now make a map with those points and connect point a to point c, point b to poin c and point c to point d"
[14:31:23] <doug65536> "make a map?"
[14:31:23] <Fusl> so jquery should place each point in a place where it is good
[14:31:56] <Fusl> each, look for coordinates, calculate itself, etc.
[14:32:14] <Fusl> i shouldn't need to say where each point should be
[14:32:34] <doug65536> Fusl: seriously? I'll make a fiddle and see how utterly simple it is... 1 sec
[14:38:20] <Fusl> doug65536: k?
[14:40:44] <doug65536> fusl http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RLBdE/7/
[14:41:06] <SuRfDeMoN> I have a page with a ul on it and it has a data-role="listview" but all the li's don't have the correct formatting, if i run $('#list').listview('refresh'); in console it fixes them, how / when do I run this ? I have tried in delegate pagecreate (where the li's are added to the ul) and in pageinit
[14:41:09] <doug65536> Fusl: you have an array of objects with x y properties or something?
[14:41:14] <Fusl> yeah
[14:41:20] <Fusl> but i dont want to set x/y coordinates
[14:41:38] <doug65536> Fusl: oh, you want the computer to magically know the coordinates?
[14:41:40] <Fusl> i want just say "you have 10 points, connect some to each other and decide where to put them"
[14:41:42] <Fusl> yeah
[14:41:42] <Fusl> :D
[14:41:52] <Fusl> where they fit the best
[14:42:00] <Fusl> i already saw something like this, but dont know where it was
[14:42:04] <doug65536> Fusl: ok, this is a waste of my time. good luck
[14:42:17] <Kambfhase> haha, you forgot to delete the debugger statement :)
[14:42:17] <Fusl> k, although thank you
[14:42:50] <Kambfhase> I always had the feeling that no one uses that.
[14:48:03] <Fusl> doug65536: http://projects.flowingdata.com/tut/interactive_network_demo/
[14:48:04] <Fusl> ha :D
[14:50:02] <SuRfDeMoN> how can I run $('#list').listview('refresh') once the page is displayed? without running it from a conlose ?
[14:50:08] <SuRfDeMoN> console
[14:51:16] <duckgoose> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:51:57] <doug65536> Kambfhase: I use it when chrome debugger screws up and gives me a blank source file in the display
[14:52:31] <Kambfhase> mkay. I have never seen that happen
[14:52:49] <doug65536> I just updated today and it's just started today
[14:53:09] <SuRfDeMoN> duckgoose:  what about if it is jquery mobile and all the pages are on the same .html ?
[14:57:41] <SuRfDeMoN> I keep getting this when trying to refresh the listview Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[15:10:40] <SuRfDeMoN> hmm.... managed to make it work by using delegate and getting pageinit to add the li's and then pageshow to refresh the listview, but you see the list broken on screen for a split second before the refresh kicks in... surely there is a better way than this
[15:21:18] <doug65536> seriously? jquery 1.10.1 doesn't even load in IE10?
[15:23:49] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[15:25:45] <SuRfDeMoN> doug65536: does anything load in IE10? ;)
[15:25:58] <doug65536> lol. exactly
[15:54:12] <scar> how can i use html5 canvas to draw in a rectangle that's another image?
[15:57:19] <tw2113> not sure this is the right room for that scar
[15:57:26] <scar> hrm
[15:57:36] <scar> been using js to do it ha
[15:57:41] <scar> maybe im doin it wrong
[15:57:48] <tw2113> yeah, js, not jquery
[15:58:12] <scar> ahh mkay. well thank you heh
[16:07:22] <Tamborine> Good morning guys I hope your all well... I have an issue where .text() or .html() won't write to a span with span id="logout-countdown". I can see that the element exists and jquery knows about it as per this example: http://pastebin.com/uSLrT5dJ
[16:08:04] <doug65536> Tamborine: this again?
[16:08:12] <Tamborine> yep, back at work on a monday :P
[16:08:15] <Tamborine> still haven't solved it
[16:08:37] <doug65536> well, stop focusing on the .html and .text - they work!
[16:08:41] <doug65536> bug is something else
[16:09:02] <Tamborine> well i'm calling directly on jquery... nothing else..
[16:09:19] <Tamborine> the callback for app.popover.launch is called
[16:10:04] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/BASSk/
[16:10:24] <Tamborine> yeah... i'll check for multiple id's... more than likely the problem
[16:11:03] <doug65536> Tamborine: I wrote you a fiddle that did the countdown with the same ids and everything and it worked
[16:11:35] <doug65536> Tamborine: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ywp96/5/
[16:12:07] <doug65536> Tamborine: don't do 'if' like that
[16:12:18] <doug65536> Tamborine: do $('span#logout-countdown').length
[16:14:10] <doug65536> Tamborine: the way you have your if, it will *always* be true, no matter what
[16:15:15] <doug65536> if ($('asdfasdfadfadf')) console.log('I told you it was always true');
[16:15:15] <doug65536> I told you it was always true
[16:15:58] <doug65536> Tamborine: ^
[16:17:24] <doug65536> $() always returns an object, which in that case happens to be an empty collection - with zero length. but an empty collection is true because an object is always true
[16:19:45] <doug65536> > $
[16:20:07] <doug65536> js> $
[16:20:15] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[16:20:43] <doug65536> js> print($('asdfasdfadf') ? 'true' : 'false')
[16:20:49] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[16:21:04] <doug65536> :( b-ot sucks
[16:22:47] <doug65536> js> typeof $
[16:22:53] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[16:23:02] <doug65536> js> print(typeof $)

[16:33:00] <hazardous> hi
[16:33:12] <hazardous> i have $(".traTcSb").slideUp();
[16:33:22] <hazardous> how can i have that match .traTcSb but not #ts-4
[16:33:32] <Blacklite> $(".traTcSb:not(#ts-4)").slideUp();
[16:33:40] <hazardous> thanks
[16:33:44] <Blacklite> np
[16:33:50] <hazardous> what is [name!="value"] (?) or something notation
[16:33:53] <hazardous> is it all ()?
[16:34:12] <Blacklite> no, [name!=value] is correct i think
[16:34:35] <Blacklite> you use the [] for attributes, whereas functions such as not() have parenthesis
[16:34:38] <hazardous> ahh ok
[16:34:41] <hazardous> thanks!
[16:34:46] <Blacklite> no worries
[17:13:42] <raj> shoky, now?
[17:32:14] <whybobwhy> can anyone tell me how to use a variable in an array?  ex. user[num] = {'name': +namevar};
[17:40:18] <onenine90> Hey guys. Just wondering about your input on this.. What jQuery plug-in do you use for form validation (if any)? And is there one that is considered one of the best?
[17:49:22] <rgr> there is one and only one to consider
[17:49:38] <rgr> and its the first google gives you. jquery validate plugin
[17:49:44] <rgr> used it today. Its excellent.
[17:50:26] <rgr> whybobwhy : thats one to ask in #javascript. But you answered your own question.
[18:23:26] <joey_> i am looking to use a variable as an array object value, is this possible(I have googled for atleast an hour already and cant find anything)? ex. user[num] = {'name': <variable>, 'phone': <2nd variable> };
[18:24:32] <Mattx> Hello
[18:25:17] <Mattx> $("#of-main"); -> <section id=​"of-main" ...>
[18:25:17] <Mattx> $("#of-main")[0] -> undefined
[18:25:17] <Mattx> $("#of-main").get(0) -> TypeError: Object #<HTMLElement> has no method 'get'
[18:25:24] <Mattx> what's wrong?
[18:25:32] <joey_> Anyone? I would like to have this sorted out shortly.
[18:26:46] <joey_> Mattx: what are you trying to do?
[18:27:09] <Mattx> I'm trying to get the object of that element
[18:27:18] <Mattx> without jquery's wrapper
[18:27:59] <joey_> Ok I thought I would try and help but I am new to jQuery so this is over my head. Sorry:(
[18:28:48] <Mattx> hmn.. anyone else?
[18:30:12] <joey_> Mattx: I haven't had much luck with my problem in the evening, if you can come back on tomorrow you may get more help.
[18:30:22] <Mattx> what's your problem?
[18:30:38] <joey_> i am looking to use a variable as an array object value, is this possible(I have googled for atleast an hour already and cant find anything)? ex. user[num] = {'name': <variable>, 'phone': <2nd variable> };
[18:31:12] <Mattx> what's the problem with that?
[18:31:50] <joey_> i think i am formatting the variable wrong as I get "undefined" or "NaN"
[18:32:22] <Mattx> a = {}; a[1] = {name: "foo", phone: "bar"}
[18:32:25] <Mattx> try this ^
[18:32:39] <joey_> ok thanks
[18:33:12] <joey_> so the "a" would replace my "user"?
[18:34:40] <Mattx> in fact your example works if you initialize the missing parts:
[18:34:41] <Mattx> a="foo"; b="bar"; user={}; num=1; user[num] = {'name': a, 'phone': b};
[18:34:51] <Mattx> returns:    Object {name: "foo", phone: "bar"}
[18:35:21] <joey_> ok this looks good, one sec
[18:36:19] <joey_> ok right now I have user = []; to make my array would {} break it
[18:38:42] <joey_> my user[1].name returns undefined
[18:40:32] <joey_> the name variable gets its value from var name = $("name"+tempnum).val();    i have 10 textboxes with IDs name<#>
[18:40:57] <Mattx> > user=[]; user[1] = {name: "foo", phone: "bar"}; console.log(user[1].name)
[18:40:57] <Mattx> foo
[18:40:57] <Mattx>  
[18:42:11] <joey_> console says undefined
[18:42:30] <joey_> wait i missed somethink
[18:42:37] <joey_> *something
[18:43:12] <joey_> now it outputs foo
[18:45:54] <joey_> it seems that my variable used to set the name is not being set properly...
[18:47:20] <joey_> var name = $("name"+tempnum).val();      console.log(name); (this returns undefined
[18:49:00] <pearson> Hi, backend developer here.  The $.ajax() method is constructing jsonp urls of the form ?callback=jQuery1102046337149920873344_1377481398585&_=1377481398586 .  Is it normal for that underscore parameter to be there?  I can't find any mention of it in the docs, SO, etc.
[18:49:06] <Mattx> maybe it's not val() that you need
[18:49:43] <joey_> is there another way of grabbing the value?
[18:49:44] <pearson> -_- Of course, as soon as I enter here, I find it: http://stackoverflow.com/q/12709686/120999
[18:51:21] <joey_> can i make a jsfiddle to show you the rest of my code and maybe you might get another thought then?
[18:52:13] <Mattx> what kind of input is it?
[18:52:21] <joey_> text
[18:52:55] <Mattx> then val should work
[18:53:08] <Mattx> check if $("whateve_here") is returning the element
[18:54:02] <joey_> ok one sec
[18:55:48] <joey_> how can i run $("whateve_here").val(); in a alert?
[18:56:23] <joey_> nevermind i will just make a variable
[18:56:35] <Mattx> alert(...) ? xD
[18:57:09] <joey_> dreamweaver was giving me an error
[18:57:23] <pixelpimp> error: it's not 1998
[18:57:24] <Mattx> well, stop using it
[18:57:29] <Mattx> haha
[18:57:40] <joey_> lol
[18:58:01] <joey_> my adobe package is the only stoping me from switching to linux
[18:58:19] <pixelpimp> dual boot
[18:58:58] <joey_> anyways var test = $("#name1").val();   alert(test); works fine
[18:59:10] <pixelpimp> not sure how photoshop runs under a vm... probably a memory hog
[18:59:16] <Mattx> put it in the same way you have the real code
[18:59:22] <Mattx> $("..."+foo), etc
[18:59:50] <joey_> not sure i understand :(
[19:00:04] <Mattx> name = $("name"+tempnum).val(); alert(name)
[19:00:23] <Mattx> pixelpimp, do you happen to use bootstrap or foundation?
[19:00:24] <joey_> ok
[19:00:28] <Mattx> or you joey_?
[19:00:50] <pixelpimp> neither
[19:00:55] <joey_> um not sure 0.o
[19:01:02] <Mattx> ok, then no :P
[19:01:07] <pixelpimp> that's not a good thing ;)
[19:01:17] <joey_> i am new
[19:01:19] <vernonk> WHOIS vernonk
[19:01:26] <pixelpimp> youis vernonk
[19:01:29] <vernonk> ;)
[19:01:52] <vernonk> Forgot my /
[19:02:30] <pixelpimp> /whois vernonk
[19:02:36] <vernonk> yep
[19:02:59] <joey_> that works!!
[19:03:21] <joey_> now just let me sort my code here and i will try with the array
[19:04:03] <joey_> lol i forgot the "#"
[19:05:08] <Mattx> I had to add a margin-top: -5px to align an image vertically, it sucks u.u
[19:05:24] <pixelpimp> that does suck.  you probably don't need it.  example?
[19:05:34] <Mattx> I do need it
[19:05:46] <Mattx> for some reason the image is not being aligned vertically
[19:05:57] <Mattx> well, it kind of work without this margin
[19:05:58] <pixelpimp> right.  give me an example and i can probably tell you waht it is
[19:06:12] <Mattx> but it's misaligned by 5px for some reason lol
[19:06:45] <Mattx> let me write one and see if I can reproduce the problem outside of foundation
[19:06:55] <joey_> well thanks Mattx you just solved todays problem(litterally all day) so again Thank You!
[19:07:11] <pixelpimp> could also be foundation's fault (i don't even know what it does)
[19:08:17] <Mattx> joey_, tip for the future: when you have a problem try to break it in parts so you can check each one independently from the rest, like in this case adding alerts() and so on
[19:10:31] <pixelpimp> also, use console.log() over alert() so you don't have that stupid popup
[19:11:01] <pixelpimp> you can also use console.dir() to print out an object, in case you want to see what internal variables look like
[19:11:27] <pixelpimp> hit F12 to open the inspector in chrome, esc to open the console
[19:11:53] <Mattx> yeah, what pixelpimp said
[19:12:00] <Mattx> and stop using dreamweaver!
[19:12:09] <pixelpimp> alternatively (and really better if you don't need the whole inspector), ctrl+shift+j
[19:12:38] <pixelpimp> and yeah.  stop using dreamweaver.
[19:15:44] <Mattx> http://jsfiddle.net/RRHaJ/
[19:15:45] <Mattx> you see?
[19:16:05] <Mattx> the text is slightly above the middle
[19:16:21] <Mattx> I guess it's because the text is aligned using the baseline or something like that
[19:19:13] <Mattx> pixelpimp, ^
[19:23:36] <pixelpimp> put it in a span and set vertical-align: middle
[19:24:05] <pixelpimp> http://jsfiddle.net/RRHaJ/1/
[19:24:22] <pixelpimp> yours on top
[19:25:49] <Mattx> oh, that's a cool hack
[19:25:50] <Mattx> thanks
[19:27:14] <pixelpimp> better than negative margins for sure :)
[19:27:23] <pixelpimp> and still makes sense in the markup
[19:27:46] <Mattx> no, wait. it was already on a span in the real example. somehow it doesn't work, always..
[19:27:56] <Mattx> but yeah, it seems it should fix the problem, weird
[19:28:01] <Mattx> I'll check that
[19:28:26] <pixelpimp> lol uh oh ;P
[19:29:19] <pixelpimp> i think the issue was that your text was being drawn at baseline and the image was middle
[19:29:41] <pixelpimp> setting vertical-align: baseline; should set it back to the bad position
[19:34:39] <pixelpimp> man, i spent like 12 hours yesterday hacking up a site design, and today i've made zero progress
[19:34:50] <pixelpimp> at least i'm still very happy with how it turned out
[19:36:09] <Mattx> :P
[19:36:32] <hazardous> what is the simplest way i can have a "show more / show less" button toggle between states?
[19:36:46] <hazardous> my first thought was to just .html("show less") on it but that sounds like a horrendously bad idea
[19:37:40] <pixelpimp> add and remove a class
[19:37:45] <pixelpimp> .expanded, for example
[19:45:49] <hazardous> and use something liek :before or :after { content: ""} ?
[19:46:30] <pixelpimp> sure :)
[20:33:50] <ibiwan> heyas
[20:33:54] <ibiwan> two questions...
[20:34:03] <ibiwan> what does this select, and where do I look to learn how these work in general?  $('input[type=radio]',this.form)
[20:38:28] <kborchers> ibiwan: that selects all inputs with type equal to radio within the context of this.form
[20:38:39] <kborchers> ibiwan: check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ and http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[20:40:02] <kborchers> ibiwan: also, radio should be in quotes
[20:44:06] <ibiwan> all inputs?  so does whatever function I dot-hang off the selector get applied to each selected item in turn?
[20:50:28] <kborchers> ibiwan: if i am understanding your question, i believe you are asking about chaining and yes, anything you chain will be applied to each element in the result of that selection which would be every input with type radio inside of this.form
[20:51:22] <ibiwan> cool
[20:51:22] <ibiwan> thanks
[20:51:27] <kborchers> np
[22:10:57] <Zak> if I have no intention of submitting a form normally and i don't care about people with Javascript disabled, is there any reason to put some controls in a form tag?
[22:13:12] <pixelpimp> not really
[22:13:43] <pixelpimp> could probably screw up more if you let it accidentally submit normally
[22:14:13] <Zak> yeah definitely
[22:14:18] <pixelpimp> i'm all about graceful fallbacks, but if they're unnecessary, don't use them.
[22:15:13] <pixelpimp> Most of my work is front-end, so I hardly ever use a form in the traditional sense
[22:31:29] <Zak> pixelpimp: yeah, in my case, i've decided that if you don't have JS, then you can't use my site
[22:31:46] <Zak> the graceful fallback would just be a page telling you that you need to enable JS or update to a newer browser
[22:32:20] <pixelpimp> kinda my thought on the 'no js' thing myself
[22:32:31] <pixelpimp> i mean, it's 2013 :)
[22:32:53] <pixelpimp> i don't cater to the people that just want to make it weird for themselves
[22:33:17] <Zak> its just that this site i'm designing, there's rudimentary functionality that requires JS
[22:34:03] <Zak> i will be doing something for mobile later, so maybe that's an opportunity to do a no-JS supported page
[23:23:27] <aMoniker> If I pass the same deferred object to two different $.when functions, do the whens always execute in order?
[23:25:59] <aMoniker> They seem to always execute in order
[23:26:05] <aMoniker> I wonder if I can rely on that though.
[23:28:40] <Cork> aMoniker: when uses the don callback so it will queue just like if you used them
[23:28:45] <Cork> don==done
[23:29:04] <aMoniker> Cork: so they'll always execute in order?
[23:29:34] <Cork> they will call in the order the done callback list is processed
[23:31:21] <aMoniker> so if I make one deferred, then pass it to $.when number one, then pass it to $.when number two...
[23:31:27] <aMoniker> Cork: when one will execute before when two
[23:31:51] <Cork> aMoniker: as long as they arn't async, ya
[23:32:15] <aMoniker> Cork: not sure what you mean
[23:32:25] <Cork> defer uses an array to store the callbacks, and it will call them in order
[23:32:39] <Cork> it will be a fifo callback solution
[23:32:52] <aMoniker> ok cool
[23:33:40] <DilipRamirez> Hey guys
[23:33:42] <DilipRamirez> anyone around ?
[23:35:08] <Cork> ?ask
[23:35:08] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:37:33] <DilipRamirez> oh no, just when I was looking for a topic expert :P
[23:37:33] <DilipRamirez> anyway, This is more of a hypothetical question: Would it be possible to control a DSLR camera with javascript ?
[23:38:33] <Cork> ?g mdn camera api
[23:38:34] <b-ot> Cork: Introduction to the Camera API - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Introduction_to_the_Camera_API
[23:39:20] <DilipRamirez> but that's with a webcam, if i'm not mistaken
[23:39:53] <Cork> DilipRamirez: if you can't get the camera to work with the browsers webcam interface, then no you can't
[23:40:10] <Cork> unless you go into chrome prives javascript
[23:40:19] <Cork> and that can't be done from a webpage
[23:41:11] <DilipRamirez> Cork fair enough, I'll have to take a deeper look into that
[23:41:34] <Cork> DilipRamirez: not all browsers provide those privs
[23:41:51] <Cork> DilipRamirez: so you might have to resort to browser plugins
