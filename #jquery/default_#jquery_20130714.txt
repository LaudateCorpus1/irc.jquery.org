[00:10:18] <darkpassenger> is there a way to replace a char in a javascript object BEFORE JSON.stringify ?
[00:23:41] <shoky> darkpassenger: how do you mean
[00:30:14] <darkpassenger>  because
[00:30:30] <darkpassenger> every time I stringify the object it gets weird and i can no longer stock it in the database
[00:30:57] <darkpassenger> but if I do not stringify and replace occurences of "." char , then i cannot stock it either
[00:31:15] <darkpassenger> because mongo wont take dots
[00:42:00] <eregi> Good morning! Iâ€™m currently having some issues with http://bit.ly/14R4xqL plugin which is being used to change the iframe size from a different domain. The callback is being forgotten on safari browsers. An example page - http://bit.ly/14QlXnd I have added alert('callback'); to the rm_callback, to se when it's called. When you press on the red button that's located on the right, bottom corner, you can se that the callback function wo
[00:43:07] <ph88> good morning eregi
[01:32:29] <johnharris85> i'm populating the value of one select based on another previous one, I can do this once, but subsequent ones error and I don't know why, can anyone see an obvious mistake? code here: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf69P/1/
[01:32:56] <ph88> hi johnharris85
[01:33:17] <johnharris85> hi ph88
[01:34:18] <ph88> that looks fairly complicated code for what it's suppose to do
[01:34:57] <johnharris85> ph88: the issue i'm trying to solve is that users will be dynamically adding selects with data-tool="value"
[01:35:15] <ph88> ye i see that
[01:35:19] <johnharris85> and each time they will need to be populated based on the closest previous select with data-tool="field"
[01:35:46] <johnharris85> i need to add the value first so i can find the closest previous field
[01:36:05] <johnharris85> then i get the field, get the data, and reset the html of the most recently added value based on that
[01:37:03] <johnharris85> (i should also say, this is a simplified example to reproduce my error, field selects will also be added dynamically, hence the need to do these checks as the select may be different each time)
[01:37:29] <ph88> getting a lot of these errors:  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[01:37:35] <johnharris85> yes, that's what i get
[01:37:43] <johnharris85> but i don't know the code works once but then doesn't...?
[01:37:50] <johnharris85> why would it suddenly fail?
[01:38:15] <johnharris85> .prev should just find the closest previous object with that attr right? [data-tool="field"]
[01:38:22] <johnharris85> which should still be the first select?
[01:38:36] <johnharris85> so why doesn't it populate subsequent value selects with the same values?
[01:42:31] <ph88> your .prev() doesnt work
[01:45:38] <ph88> johnharris85: still here ?
[01:46:19] <johnharris85> ph88:  ye
[01:46:25] <johnharris85> it doesn't work?
[01:46:30] <johnharris85> how come it finds it once?
[01:46:46] <johnharris85> and, how come it doesn't work? :p
[01:46:56] <johnharris85> that's a legal selector right?
[01:47:23] <ph88> what's your goal here ?
[01:47:32] <ph88> why copy selects  ??
[01:48:44] <johnharris85> field selects and value selects are created dynamically
[01:49:07] <johnharris85> when a value select is created, it should lookup the closest previous field select and populate itself based on that value (via a lookup)
[01:49:25] <ph88> a lookup = ajax ?
[01:49:39] <johnharris85> no, like in the example, local dict
[01:50:07] <ph88> there is a mapping from option1 -> a, b, c
[01:50:17] <johnharris85> yes
[01:50:18] <ph88> but if user select  b -> then mapping to ... ?
[01:50:46] <johnharris85> no, the second select doesn't matter at the moment
[01:50:54] <johnharris85> there are two types of selects based on the data-tool attr7
[01:51:01] <johnharris85> that is what's important
[01:51:28] <ph88> it should lookup the closest previous field select and populate itself based on that value (via a lookup)   <-- this is not in your example
[01:51:32] <johnharris85> data-tool="value" selects should always refer to their closest previous data-tool="field" neighbours
[01:51:41] <ph88> aahh
[01:51:59] <ph88> but since you have only oen data-tool"field"  why not just use that one ?
[01:52:19] <johnharris85> the data-tool="value" select gets the current value of the previous data-tool="field", then looks up in the map for that key and populates itself with the values
[01:52:28] <johnharris85> because they can be created dynamically
[01:52:32] <johnharris85> so there will be multiple
[01:52:41] <johnharris85> but it always needs to pick from the one closest previously to it
[01:52:52] <ph88> ok but wouldn't it be a good idea if you have a group if   1x field 2x value  (for example) to put this in a div ?
[01:53:25] <ph88> so that's 3 select in 1 div
[01:54:03] <johnharris85> yes, but everything is created dynamically here, until i find the related data-tool="field" select how can i know what group div the new data-tool="value" will go in?
[01:54:11] <johnharris85> also, how would that fix the code?
[01:54:26] <johnharris85> i don't see any reason the code i've written fails on subsequent calls
[01:54:28] <johnharris85> when it works on the first
[02:00:14] <ph88>  im just considering maybe to rewite this code so it becomes easier ...
[02:01:42] <johnharris85> ph88:  i don't see a way to make it easier and retain the complex functionality
[02:02:12] <ph88> addedElement.prev('[data-tool="field"]');  <-- this doesn't work on second iteration
[02:02:16] <ph88> your code breaks here
[02:02:24] <johnharris85> yes, i'd also narrowed to that
[02:02:27] <ph88> never mind if val() is there or not
[02:02:31] <johnharris85> but i don't know why?
[02:05:28] <ph88> you can make a new test case
[02:05:32] <ph88> for your priv() function with selector
[02:06:49] <ph88> prev() *
[02:10:48] <johnharris85> ph88: if you change the prev to prevAll() it works fine....
[02:10:53] <johnharris85> i don't understand that at all.
[02:11:18] <ph88> oh
[02:11:19] <ph88> d0h
[02:11:36] <ph88> prev only looks at just the previous element then :P
[02:11:47] <johnharris85> what's the point in specifying a selector then?
[02:11:57] <johnharris85> and that's not what the documentation says?
[02:12:04] <ph88> it's just a condition then
[02:12:29] <ph88> no it does say so on the top  "Get the immediately preceding sibling"
[02:12:46] <johnharris85> ah i just read the small print
[02:12:54] <johnharris85> the selector is an optional filter
[02:12:58] <ph88> so at first your original [data-tool="field"] is the  immediately preceding ... but after that it's the one before that one
[02:13:01] <johnharris85> fuuuuuuuuuuuck
[02:13:06] <ph88> lol :P
[02:13:11] <johnharris85> ok guess i'll be reading it more carefully next time
[02:13:52] <ph88> i was making a nice test case where it change the background-color that looked pretty funny :P
[02:14:41] <johnharris85> thanks for your help ph88  :)
[02:15:01] <ph88> well you found it yourself :P
[02:15:16] <ph88> there is still another bug in your code
[02:15:54] <johnharris85> you were my rubber duck ;)
[02:16:00] <johnharris85> what's the other bug?
[02:16:00] <ph88> o_O
[02:16:02] <ph88> naughty !
[02:16:11] <johnharris85> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[02:17:38] <ph88> oh no that's my bad actually :P
[02:18:53] <ph88> johnharris85: check this http://jsfiddle.net/Zf69P/4/
[02:18:54] <ph88> lol
[02:19:07] <johnharris85> ph88: not pretending it's pretty code, it's full of gak (my day job is python so this is horrific), but given the complex problem i don't see a 'nicer' way, unless you have any suggestions?
[02:19:08] <ph88> put it like that on your website xD
[02:19:24] <ph88> you wanna make it nicer ?
[02:20:12] <johnharris85> ph88:  well to start with it just seems dirty to add an empty one just to be able to get the closest previous one
[02:20:13] <ph88> what's the intended layout ?  you want to be able to add selects indefinately and just text-wrap them in a regular div ??
[02:20:37] <ph88> i think you should put 1 field with X value  together in a div
[02:20:56] <ph88> 1 field select + x amount of value select
[02:21:11] <ph88> how do you like my colorful debugging case ? xD
[02:21:34] <ph88> LMFAO at the wikipedia image
[02:26:43] <johnharris85> lol
[02:28:12] <ph88> so what about the layout then ?
[02:52:38] <motaka2> hello, i dont understand how this code cause delays for keyup event can anyone explain me? /msg NickServ identify <password>
[02:53:25] <motaka2> hello, i dont understand how this code cause delays for keyup event can anyone explain me? http://pastebin.com/jvejewZR
[03:01:42] <ph88> motaka2: the event itself is immediate ... the action triggered by the event is delayed
[03:05:39] <motaka2> ph88: Yes I undestand now, how can make it simpler and move it to file that is laways included ?
[03:06:54] <ph88> what file ? laways ??
[03:09:16] <motaka2> i have file named Js.js in which i hold frequent methods , and i use the delay functin in several places, I want to have function like function makeDelay(){....} , I dont want it like IIF ,
[03:16:37] <ph88> why not just move that var delay = .... to the Js.js ?
[03:17:31] <ph88> maybe you like this https://github.com/jchavannes/jquery-timer
[03:20:55] <gutto> Hi, this is probably more of a pure JS issue but has anyone encountered  setTimeout(function() { ... }, delay); to execute the function twice after a given time?
[03:22:04] <carpii> anyone using jquery mobile who has past experience in sencha touch ?
[03:22:52] <ph88> gutto: setInterval
[03:24:46] <gutto> but that will fire the function every delay, right?
[03:31:39] <ph88> ye
[03:32:03] <ph88> oh ye sorry i see you were not asking that :P
[03:32:12] <gutto> :)
[03:32:27] <ph88> well you can have it call 1 function that calls the function you want twice
[03:32:30] <gutto> with setInterval I would have to terminate the interval once its done
[03:33:05] <ph88> or just modify the function you have to do the stuff you want it to do twice
[03:33:08] <ph88> that's probably better
[03:35:13] <gutto> but the problem is it executes the function twice - but its not the desired effect, I'd like the function to be called just once
[03:35:23] <gutto> wondered if this is some kind of js bug
[03:36:27] <ph88> ooh
[03:36:33] <ph88> i misread it agian
[03:36:36] <ph88> lol
[03:36:39] <ph88> i wouldn't know abou that
[03:53:15] <gutto> k, was my bad script included twice x)  thx for trying to help me ph88
[03:53:18] <motaka2> ph88: is this better typeof $(this).attr("name") === "undefined" or typeof $(this).attr("name") == "undefined"
[03:53:31] <motaka2> ph88: I mean if undefined is a real string
[03:54:20] <ph88> ===
[03:55:22] <motaka2> ph88: thabk you my dear friend
[03:55:30] <ph88> :P
[03:56:11] <motaka2> ph88: It was a question of agaes and I was moving on with == all the time scaring if undefined is not a string
[03:57:32] <Vorspire> well, you can check undefined using this too: if( !myVar )
[04:04:33] <Vorspire> (motaka2): if( !$(this).hasAttr( "name" ) )
[04:07:09] <motaka2> Vorspire: Thank you
[04:07:44] <Vorspire> ?eval var foo = null; print(!foo ? "undefined" : "defined");
[04:07:44] <bot-t1> Vorspire: "undefined"
[04:15:36] <rynkan> Anyone using mockjax? can it handle post and delete? cand find an example :/
[04:16:06] <rue> rynkan: It can.
[04:16:23] <rue> Itâ€™s a horrible, lacking library, but thatâ€™s JS for you.
[04:17:17] <rynkan> Just started using it ysterday, I'll have to dog deeper :)
[04:17:24] <molavy> i want just load backbone and all route manage by backbone rouer
[04:17:42] <molavy> but what about when user what start from none root location
[04:17:54] <molavy> something like /search/1
[04:18:35] <molavy> how can i tell backbone generate search page on page load according to location
[04:25:43] <rynkan> What do you people use to mock upp rest-services?
[04:25:51] <molavy> any idea?
[05:38:16] <johnharris85> Why does the save button drag but the others don't? http://jsfiddle.net/xzvp7/
[05:49:45] <Iszak> johnharris85 it's because by default it cancels draggable when it's the following; input,textarea,button,select,option see http://jsfiddle.net/xzvp7/1/ for the solution
[05:59:12] <jop008> if I have an input field with numbers can I easily change it for only postive numbers allowed?
[05:59:21] <jop008> input mask not afterwards
[06:01:08] <Iszak> jop008 sure
[06:04:29] <knightmare> i'm using ie8,wanna update iframe.src
[06:09:16] <pYr0x> hi, is it possible to slide an element with animate() without a fix duration... ? the animation should have the same time to slide -400px than -1900px
[06:10:13] <Iszak> pYr0x you mean the animation should have a /different/ time to slide -400px than -1900px?
[06:10:22] <pYr0x> yes
[06:10:22] <Iszak> because if you want them to be the same, use a duration.
[06:10:33] <pYr0x> ;)
[06:10:38] <Iszak> just do a little math, say you want 200px/second divide the number by 200 and round it.
[06:11:00] <Iszak> probably want to use Math.abs in your case too.
[06:12:17] <pYr0x> Iszak: the slide left is not {left: '-=1900px'}... it is to a fix left property {left: '-1900px'}
[06:13:40] <Iszak> so then you'll take it's existing position, get the different to the new position and again so the same math.
[06:13:45] <Iszak> s/different/difference/
[06:13:52] <pYr0x> ok
[06:15:02] <Iszak> this way, you have a predictable speed, this is what you want, right? but not predictable duration.
[06:15:13] <Iszak> well, the duration is predictable, but not fixed rather.
[06:15:39] <pYr0x> the speed to slide should the same
[06:15:58] <jop008> how to check for checkbox checked I use $oel.context.checked
[06:16:00] <Iszak> yeah, that should do it, the division will define the speed.
[06:16:09] <Iszak> ?is @ jop008
[06:16:09] <b-ot> jop008: is
[06:16:10] <bot-t1> jop008, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[06:16:13] <pYr0x> ok .. i will test
[06:16:17] <Iszak> ?:checked @ jop008
[06:16:17] <bot-t1> jop008, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[06:18:36] <jop008> $oel.is("checked")
[06:18:39] <jop008> like this?
[06:18:52] <jop008> returns false but it is true
[06:22:40] <Iszak> jop008 missing the colan
[06:22:45] <Iszak> $oel.is(':checked')
[06:35:18] <jop008> solved how to test restrict only positive numbers?
[06:35:34] <jop008> plugin needed?
[06:35:41] <Iszak> jop008 not at all.
[06:35:57] <Iszak> jop008 you can use html5 attribute "pattern" I believe on inputs to restrict it to numbers only.
[06:36:12] <jop008> thx
[06:36:20] <Iszak> Alternatively, you can bind an event on keydown and check if the value is positive and if it's not, prevent entering.
[06:37:29] <jop008> so like this <input type="text" pattern="\d*" />
[06:38:10] <jop008> you can specify a minimum option also
[06:39:42] <Trudko> guys how to align  link with the image from jquery ui http://jsbin.com/izevuq/1/edit
[06:40:54] <Iszak> jop008 pattern="^\d{1,4}$" something like that, will limit to 1 and 4
[06:52:03] <fesener_> can someone tell me how to add .sortable() to a dynamically created content ?
[07:00:31] <johnharris85> i have a select inside a li, but i can't get it to dropdown and work properly, http://jsfiddle.net/dNmgm/
[07:05:38] <Iszak> johnharris85 and this is why it cancelled inputs, selects, buttons, etc.
[07:06:02] <Iszak> johnharris85 if you want it to work for selects and only selects change it to cancel: 'select'
[07:07:23] <johnharris85> thank you Iszak , but I want to the select to be sortable, i also want it to work
[07:07:40] <johnharris85> is that impossible>
[07:07:43] <Iszak> johnharris85 you probably need a mechanism to enable or disable it accordingly.
[07:17:01] <aleray> how can I select all element that have the class ".foobar" and class ".foo" OR ".bar"? (eg. <a class="foobar foo"> = OK but <a class="foobar bla"> not OK)
[07:18:28] <HarryPitfall> .foobar.foo
[07:19:04] <aleray> so my selector will be $('.foobar.foo|.foobar.bar') ?
[07:19:07] <aleray> HarryPitfall,
[07:19:21] <HarryPitfall> .foobar.foo, .foobar.bar
[07:19:46] <HarryPitfall> it's uses basically the same rules of css files
[07:20:36] <aleray> no way to make it shorter ? I have many classes like "foo" and "bar". I wanted to do something like $('.foobar').filterSelf('.foo,.bar')
[07:20:46] <aleray> but filterSelf doesn't exists of course
[07:22:24] <aleray> just out of curiosity, otherwise it is ok
[07:36:29] <Konda> Do anyone have the link to the plugin that supports color animations in jquery? I've found some many different plugins on this site, http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project-release-api-compatibility/12x, but I dont know which one to choose.
[07:40:33] <HarryPitfall> filter does the work
[07:40:45] <HarryPitfall> $('.foobar').filter('.foo, .bar')
[07:41:13] <HarryPitfall> but the first one is better, since will use native querySelector if avaiable
[07:41:33] <spobat> handling on windows.resize event quickly gets to be a buggy thing, because many events are fired.
[07:41:48] <spobat> I only need the window width resize, is there then a more optimal solution?
[07:44:11] <bluesm> Can I set class as attribute ?
[07:48:36] <rets> hi, I'm trying to learn jQuery, I've gotten through quite a bit, but noticed I might be missing something very basic in my understanding.
[07:48:38] <rets> http://jsbin.com/okicuc/1/
[07:48:57] <rets> This is some sort of flight booking app
[07:49:17] <rets> I'm unbinding the click event for $this whenever I click on a seat
[07:49:23] <rets> so the user cant keep clicking on it
[07:49:30] <rets> I cant understand why it gets re-binded for all the other seats though
[07:50:08] <rets> now, I assume its because of the last line. what I think I'm missing about jQuery is the way the code is read by the browser
[07:50:26] <rets> I thought the function gets called once I click, and then why would it even get to the last line to re-bind the click event for all the other seats?
[07:56:03] <dabear> rets: you are setting one event listener for each of the elements there
[07:56:18] <dabear> e.g. there is a(n implicit) loop
[07:56:34] <rets> I'm not sure what you mean, how so?
[07:57:15] <dabear> when you are unbinding, you aren't unbinding the listener for every element
[07:57:30] <dabear> you are just unbinding the listener for the currently clicked element
[07:57:37] <rets> right
[07:57:45] <rets> thats what I want to do, I dont want the currently clicked element to still be clickable
[07:58:52] <dabear> that's what your code does too
[07:59:00] <dabear> not sure what the problem actually is?
[07:59:06] <fesener_> hi everyone, i have this small code that let me create popovers with ajax content http://pastebin.com/y0KY0LEC, would someone tell me how can I make this so it automatically closes after 2 seconds
[07:59:12] <bluesm> Hi
[07:59:16] <fesener_> or whenever user clicks somewhere else, that would be better
[07:59:43] <dabear> ?mdc setinterval @ fesener_
[07:59:50] <bot-t1> fesener_, window.setInterval - Web API reference | MDN - Calls a function or executes a code snippet repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setInterval
[08:00:02] <dabear> sorry
[08:00:03] <fesener_> i've tried it but it doesnt work
[08:00:07] <rets> dabear: my question was more in the sense that I'm not sure how the code runs
[08:00:08] <dabear> ?mdc settimeout @ fesener_
[08:00:09] <bot-t1> fesener_, window.setTimeout - Web API reference | MDN - Calls a function or executes a code snippet after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setTimeout
[08:00:09] <fesener_> i tried setTimeout
[08:00:11] <fesener_> actually
[08:00:20] <rets> dabear: does the line outside the function get executed once, which binds every single seat?
[08:00:22] <moldy> hi
[08:00:40] <rets> and then, if I was to go clicking on every seat, they would all get unbound?
[08:01:42] <moldy> trying to use some jquery fx. i don't get any js errors, but the effects don't seem to run. however, my callback function on complete is being run, so i assume jquery is being included correctly. any idea how to debug this?
[08:01:51] <dabear> rets: when you do $(".manyelements").click(fn), jquery loops over each element and sets an eventlistener using addEventListener
[08:01:58] <fesener_> dabear, when i add this: http://pastebin.com/15BK0UMA it closes whenever user clicks somewhere else BUT after I make it .sortable() it sorta fails to retrieve content when I move it somewhere else
[08:02:32] <fesener_> can't I make something both sortable and also can show popover on click ?
[08:03:02] <dabear> sorry, I haven't used sortables that much :)
[08:03:41] <fesener_> i dont think its directly related with sortable :/ it just pops up automatically but doesnt retrieve any content from ajax, does that ring any bell to you ?
[08:04:02] <fesener_> if I move it, popover still works but it doesnt get any content, to be more exact.
[08:05:19] <dabear> moldy: animating colors and some other properties is not supported without plugins.
[08:05:28] <fesener_> if I remove that small code to close popovers, then it works perfectly but then i cant close popovers :(
[08:07:42] <rets> dabear: and it only does that on load, once. correct?
[08:07:45] <rets> on load of the JS file I mean
[08:08:20] <dabear> rets: correct, new elements defines later will not get bound, if that's what you mean
[08:08:25] <moldy> dabear: what i am trying to run is slideDown(). i just noticed that animate() does work. do i need a plugin for slideDown()?
[08:08:45] <dabear> moldy: nah
[08:09:01] <dabear> moldy: I think slideDown has problems with some tables or something
[08:09:20] <rets> dabear: thanks for the help!
[08:11:18] <rets> oh, one more thing.
[08:11:29] <rets> does on() replace live()/click()?
[08:11:37] <dabear> rets: use event delegation, see http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:11:49] <dabear> click is still usable
[08:11:56] <dabear> live should be avoided
[08:11:58] <moldy> dabear: hm ok, thanks
[08:12:25] <rets> why would I want to use click over on("click")?
[08:12:40] <dabear> readability
[08:12:45] <dabear> personal preference
[08:12:51] <dabear> shorter
[08:12:57] <rets> but that is all right?
[08:13:14] <dabear> .click is just a shortcut for on("click")
[08:13:15] <rets> I mean, either would work
[08:13:15] <moldy> dabear: http://dpaste.com/1300219/
[08:13:25] <rets> I thought .click was a shortcut for bind("click")
[08:15:29] <dabear> rets: implementation details of no concern, they are using the same native apis behind the scenes
[08:16:43] <dabear> rets: but .click is actually now a shortcut for on("click")
[08:17:22] <rets> ahh I see
[08:17:25] <rets> alright, thanks again
[08:17:43] <rets> thats the problem with outdated tutorials I guess :)
[08:19:39] <dabear> also, bind() is a shortcut for on() :)
[08:25:34] <rets> jesus, now they're talking about delegate() which also seems to do more or less the same thing
[08:26:40] <dabear> rets: who are "they"
[08:26:52] <dabear> delegate should be avoided
[08:27:17] <rets> codeschool.com
[08:27:33] <rets> so live/delegate should be avoided, and on/bind/ are interchangable?
[08:28:04] <dabear> always use .on or the shorthands, like .click
[08:28:17] <rets> ok, thanks
[08:28:48] <dabear> delegate is also just a shorhand for .on :)
[08:30:30] <dabear> rets: read the docs, for example on http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:30:43] <dabear> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[08:42:38] <fesener_> isnt this supposed to close all popovers but the one i've clicked : $('#user-tooltip').not(this).popover('hide'); ?

[08:58:30] <nVee> hey guys, with the jquery accordion, is there a way that I can set the active open container to a specific header based on an ID of that header as appose to using the index? I am setting via php an extra id to the container which should be open (<h3 id='active_container'> ...) and want to set that in the jqueryui as the open container
[08:58:33] <nVee> is this possible?
[09:09:32] <bytephilia> What's the difference between using the each method and just using the normal jQuery selector?
[09:18:05] <Cameron> i have a textbox and it gets bigger when i type using .scrollHeight
[09:18:18] <Cameron> but how can i make it so that when you delete the text, it collapses back to a smaller height?
[10:06:38] <Trudko> Guys is there bigger size set of jquery ui theme icons/
[10:12:16] <shahin8r> I'm using a jquery instagram script for getting the latest 14 pictures from an instagram tag (see http://pastebin.com/v0mBxYuv), but if the uploader is private the picture will not show on my page. I read that you can change the show value to something higher and then filter out how many it will display on the actual page. Any ideas on how to accomplish this?
[10:56:30] <PapaSierra> i'm trying to consider a good user experience for this scenario: a user clicks delete on an item and it is immediately removed from the container and an ajax delete is fired off. if the delete was successful then there is no further action. if the delete fails, then what???
[11:02:37] <otiuk> if i want to get the id value of a tag.. can i just use .attr?
[11:02:43] <otiuk> or is there a better way?
[11:03:28] <RRR2> element.id
[11:03:43] <RRR2> but that's for element objects not jQuery objetcs
[11:03:58] <RRR2> I think with jQuery should work anyway
[11:04:24] <otiuk> so $("input[name='woop']:checked").id would get the id attribute for that checked radio button?
[11:12:27] <Whirl3d> if I have a bunch of links that when moused over popup an image and I want to port that behavior to a mobile equivalent, I can use the click event,. But currently the click event disables/re-enables the popups behavior..
[11:12:50] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to tell when you are dealing with a touch-click event as opposed to a mouse-click event?
[11:19:13] <ravenzz> Whirl3d try hammer.js

[11:31:40] <Konda> Hey, I have a that I am able to fade out. But when I change the divs css to "display:none" and change the function to fade in, instead of fade out, it doesn't work. Does anyone have any idea why this is? It is very strange to me!
[11:34:17] <Whirl3d> apparently your fade behavior doesn't change the display attribute, only modifies the opacity property.
[11:35:49] <Konda> here is jsfiddle if you'd like to see/try: http://jsfiddle.net/6R4X8/
[11:36:43] <Konda> if you change the javascript on line 8 to fade in, and change the display on line 67, you'll see that it wont work then the div is on display:none
[11:37:13] <Konda> which I don't understand why
[11:39:32] <Whirl3d> pfew, jsfiddle is taking forever to load.
[11:39:41] <Konda> ;)
[11:43:45] <Whirl3d> I'm actually not getting it to do anything. Might be my pc, I have a lot open, but I don't see anything happening.
[11:45:16] <Konda> well do you see the two lists under "produkter" and foretaget" on the top navigation bar? Those two are divs that fades out if you hoover them
[11:46:07] <Konda> I want to change the css to display:none and change the javascript to fade in, but as I said it doesn't work. Really can't understand why ^^
[11:46:23] <Konda> because right now they fade out okey
[11:49:49] <Whirl3d> Are you planning on supporting old browsers?
[11:50:30] <Konda> yes later on, but right now Im only trying to get it to work on my chrome browser
[11:50:48] <Whirl3d> I was just asking because this could all be done with css really easily.
[11:50:56] <Whirl3d> but not for older browsers
[11:51:05] <Konda> aha okey
[11:51:23] <Konda> well trying to learn jquery as I do it so
[11:51:43] <Konda> but you can't make the slide or fade effect in css or?
[11:53:03] <Whirl3d> Sure, you can do animation effects in css. Slide and Fade are easy. But if you want to learn jquery, that's not much help. Gimme a second to play with your fiddle.
[11:53:32] <Whirl3d> You want the submenu items to slide down and fade in, right?
[11:53:32] <Konda> okey thanks, really appreciate your effort!
[11:54:39] <Konda> actually what i want it the list to slide down and a gray background on the #nav li to fade in
[11:55:21] <Konda> with the animate backgroundcolor function
[12:12:32] <Konda> Whirl3d please let me know if you figure it out, because I'm blind on it right now
[12:13:03] <Whirl3d> I am having the hardest time with jsfiddle. Two different browsers and it is just running so slow.
[12:13:56] <Konda> ah that sucks ^^
[12:14:41] <joniop> Hello, i would like to have some help on how to use slider function with ranges ?
[12:14:51] <joniop> Can someone help me please ?
[12:18:23] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle is a complete disaster. I am gonna try jsbin
[12:19:03] <Konda> okey thanks!
[12:20:11] <longcat__> free coupon for codeschool, first come first serve :) http://go.codeschool.com/yp6ONw
[12:34:11] <Whirl3d> Konda, I am gonna have to reboot. Here is an old fiddle that I messed with a little to give you an idea of how to do what I think it is that you want...still not sure. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZSvep/
[12:34:35] <Whirl3d> bbshortly.
[12:34:40] <Konda> Okey, thanks alot, Im gonna take a look on it! ;)

[12:41:04] <joniop> Does someone have time to help me on some problem i have with jquery range slider ?
[12:41:25] <Cameron> how do i get the js element using the jquery selector?
[12:41:38] <CWSpear> Cameron, that's my name!
[12:41:52] <CWSpear> But to answer your question $('.selector')[0]
[12:42:04] <CWSpear> that will return the first .selector DOM node
[12:42:07] <Cameron> so i can do getBoundingClientRect() after selecting the element with jquery?
[12:42:13] <Cameron> oh thanks!
[12:43:04] <CWSpear> Cameron, yes
[12:43:24] <CWSpear> $('div')[0].getBoundingClientRect(); gets the rect of the first div on the page
[12:43:46] <CWSpear> $('div').get(0) is the same is $('div')[0]
[12:44:06] <CWSpear> whoops
[12:44:10] <Cameron> thanks!
[12:44:11] <CWSpear> eq(0) not get, lol
[12:44:23] <CWSpear> $('div').eq(0)
[12:44:42] <CWSpear> I lied again
[12:44:56] <CWSpear> just use $('div')[0]. I know there's another syntax but I guess I'm spacing
[12:45:51] <CWSpear> Cameron, my first instinct was right, lol: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:46:15] <CWSpear> .get() allows for a little more functionality than the [] notation

[12:49:40] <wiherek> hi
[12:49:51] <wiherek> Id like to paginate text inside a <p> element
[12:50:00] <wiherek> is there some library for that?
[12:50:02] <gordian> can anyone recommend a good responsive jQuery slider with layered functionality?
[12:50:28] <wiherek> gordian: imageflow
[12:50:31] <gordian> i.e., slide image and text are on separate layers and slide in separately or on a delay, ala http://www.mpcreation.pl/themeforest/layerslider/1/
[12:51:38] <kraljev1> why was data() on text nodes removed in 2.0.3
[12:52:31] <gordian> wiherek: seems like that's an image gallery
[12:56:51] <Cameron> whats the best way to push an element to the left? like increment margin-left?
[12:57:31] <Cameron> $('#el').css('margin-left', '+=10px');
[12:57:33] <Cameron> does that work?
[12:58:16] <shoky> kraljev1: it was?
[13:05:37] <shoky> kraljev1: seems it was removed in 1.9.1
[13:06:31] <shoky> and 2.0.0
[13:06:31] <kraljev1> shoky: this was not a smart decision
[13:06:49] <kraljev1> do you know the reason to do that?
[13:16:02] <shoky> where did he go.. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8335
[13:23:10] <wiherek> ok, is it possible to columns - parts of text inside an element, display with css3 column-width style?
[13:23:25] <wiherek> is it possible to *select* columns :)
[13:23:52] <wiherek> soo.. let me restate the question:
[13:24:22] <wiherek> is it possible to select (with jquery) specific columns of text created by the css3 style column-width?

[13:41:45] <spobat> is jsfiddle today extremely slow?
[13:41:48] <spobat> It really feels
[13:54:55] <CWSpear> I'm really struggling. These IRC clients for Android are a little lacking
[13:56:15] <johnharris85> I'm trying to parse html into jquery objects that i can iterate through, can anyone take a look at this SRE and let me know what i'm doing wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/vE3uD/1/
[13:58:34] <CWSpear> Try $("#results") instead of $(results)
[14:00:11] <CWSpear> johnharris85, you're using results as a var which is undefined
[14:01:05] <johnharris85> CWSpear: just corrected that and didn't fix it, how come Results: printed out then?
[14:01:14] <johnharris85> (that's more of an intrigue question)
[14:01:31] <CWSpear> Did you replace it in both places?
[14:06:29] <johnharris85> CWSpear: yes
[14:06:36] <johnharris85> but that didn't the fix the problem
[14:07:28] <CWSpear> I'm on my phone, so hard to test. I think you want to try appending $(this).html (), but that still isn't working
[14:07:57] <CWSpear> I can't see the console on my phone. But I verified data is what we would expect... That should work
[14:08:38] <johnharris85> CWSpear: when i run this is just tries to do the operations on a string
[14:08:45] <johnharris85> what i get when i run it
[14:09:26] <johnharris85> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:<h1 class="item">This is heading 1</h1>       <h2>This is heading 2</h2>    etc etc....
[14:10:11] <CWSpear> Oh... One sec
[14:12:45] <CWSpear> http://jsfiddle.net/6msLT/
[14:13:32] <CWSpear> I have it logging there. I didn't realize I put it in the wrong place until it was to late and it's too hard to move around with phone

[14:18:06] <joniop> Hello, i'd like to make a slider with values tooltip + other tooltips based on range values (ie : for 0 to 20 = low)
[14:18:12] <joniop> How can i do that ?
[14:20:40] <joniop> Anyone ?
[14:21:25] <Eviltwin> On average you're going to have to wait longer than 2 minutes to get your questions answered here
[14:21:34] <Eviltwin> Especially if they're that vague
[14:21:39] <joniop> Alright
[14:21:51] <Eviltwin> I suggest putting together an image that helps explain exactly what you're trying to do
[14:21:56] <Eviltwin> And include that with your question
[14:22:20] <Eviltwin> You can continue to re-ask the question every half hour or so but please try to include a little bit more specifics
[14:22:49] <joniop> yes, i'll try to be more specific
[14:22:57] <joniop> i'm making an illustration so everyone gets it
[14:22:59] <joniop> thanks
[14:23:21] <johnharris85> CWSpear: http://jsfiddle.net/6msLT/1/ ?
[14:23:24] <johnharris85> that doesn't work either
[14:28:39] <CWSpear1> johnharris85: what was that link again?
[14:28:52] <CWSpear1> I'm on my laptop now, lol
[14:30:45] <CWSpear1> johnharris85: http://jsfiddle.net/pW32G/
[14:34:00] <joniop> I already have a slider showing a value "Tooltip" corresponding to the location of the handle on my slider. I want to build a second tooltip based on the range of the value, like in this exemple : http://i.imgur.com/0TDHkWs.jpg?1?1754 .
[14:34:22] <joniop> But i don't know how to do it
[14:34:54] <grafi> why not?
[14:35:08] <grafi> you basically look what the value is, and display a text no?
[14:35:24] <joniop> yes but i don't know how to do that
[14:35:31] <joniop> i'm sort of a beginner in js
[14:35:33] <joniop> and jquery
[14:35:42] <grafi> and programming in general?
[14:35:51] <joniop> sort of
[14:35:52] <joniop> =)
[14:35:57] <joniop> i know the basics
[14:35:58] <grafi> got ya
[14:36:21] <grafi> so first of all where's a fiddle with what you have so far
[14:36:30] <joniop> wait a sec
[14:36:33] <joniop> i'm building it
[14:40:36] <joniop> i have this http://jsfiddle.net/qnuyc/
[14:40:47] <joniop> but i don't know why it doesn't seem to display the slider
[14:40:52] <joniop> it works in my html file
[14:41:16] <grafi> gotta include jquery-ui too, checkbox top left
[14:41:27] <joniop> oh right
[14:41:32] <joniop> thanks
[14:42:15] <joniop> so, for now, i only have the tooltip of my slider handle value
[14:42:30] <grafi> jup
[14:43:41] <grafi> what you need now is a function do determin what text to display e.g. low, average and so on
[14:43:57] <grafi> and then another html element to put that text in
[14:44:14] <grafi> on your screenshot it looks like the tooltip is just a static box
[14:44:44] <joniop> yeah i made it on photoshop
[14:44:56] <joniop> but i want it to be a simple box
[14:45:16] <grafi> easy enough
[14:45:18] <grafi> :)
[14:47:34] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/qnuyc/1/ joniop
[14:47:45] <grafi> theres your box
[14:47:55] <joniop> ok thanks
[14:47:56] <grafi> all you gotta do is put the logic in the function :)
[14:48:51] <joniop> so basically if "value1" => 0 && <= 20 then tooltip-value == Low
[14:48:59] <joniop> something like that i presume ?
[14:49:03] <johnharris85> CWSpear: sorry i dropped and didn't realise, did you have any luck?
[14:49:15] <grafi> jup, something along those lines will work fine
[14:49:42] <CWSpear> johnharris85, yeahâ€¦ let me find that link
[14:49:49] <CWSpear> http://jsfiddle.net/pW32G/
[14:49:56] <grafi> of course tooltip-value == Low wont work, that more like $('.tooltip-value').text('Low')
[14:50:08] <joniop> alright
[14:52:24] <johnharris85> CWSpear:  great thank you
[14:52:32] <CWSpear> you're welcome
[14:52:48] <CWSpear> if data had already been wrapped in a div, it would have worked, so that's why I was confused
[14:52:57] <CWSpear> cuz .html() is innerHTML
[14:53:08] <CWSpear> so by wrapping it in a div like thatâ€¦ it will always work now
[14:53:11] <CWSpear> in that case
[14:57:12] <jexmex> anybody know of any plugins that does simple resizing and cropping, prefer it to have a popup div, and have a option to lock a crop box to a certain size (to force the size)
[15:01:09] <pixelBash> I have found some behaviour in IE I just don't get http://jsfiddle.net/27DKZ/6/
[15:04:13] <pixelBash> Also why does passing a selector to a variable in http://jsfiddle.net/27DKZ/8/ make that selector disappear

[15:06:10] <naschurmann> hey guys
[15:06:12] <bluesm_> The first one "getJSON" sends data correctly
[15:06:29] <bluesm_> but the second "load" method, doesn't add to the http request, the data
[15:09:51] <bluesm_> http://i.imgur.com/SOHIOjP.png?1   ?
[15:09:54] <bluesm_> Look
[15:10:35] <naschurm_> hey bluesm_
[15:11:00] <bluesm_> naschurm_: Hey.
[15:11:16] <naschurm_> amazing!, you can readme, i'm happy :D, that was all, thanks :)
[15:14:29] <bluesm_> I see. The load assume that I send data via POST
[15:18:04] <shoky> bluesm_ .load is always a GET
[15:18:33] <krishna> Is there a good way to throttle all click events on a page? To improve the user experience for people who double click on everything.
[15:19:13] <bluesm_> shoky: You are wrong.
[15:19:27] <shoky> bluesm_: how so
[15:19:42] <bluesm_> shoky:  The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.
[15:19:49] <bluesm_> shoky : http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:20:07] <shoky> bluesm_: true dat. sorry
[15:20:08] <krishna> Preventing double clicks on a single element doesn't help. Elements often disappear and another element appears in its place. so the user ends up clicking on that instead.
[15:20:15] <bluesm_> shoky: But could you tell me how to provide data as a string ?
[15:20:27] <bluesm_> shoky: "dat." ?
[15:20:31] <grafi> that sounds arbitrary oÃ´

[15:20:47] <bluesm_> shoky: "data Type: PlainObject or String"
[15:20:57] <bluesm_> data could be passed as object or string.
[15:21:04] <bluesm_> How can I pass it by a string ?
[15:21:06] <shoky> bluesm_: with $.param i suppose
[15:21:24] <shoky> that seems really weird to me
[15:21:29] <shoky> stupid .load
[15:21:38] <grafi> ^^
[15:22:24] <krishna> I'm thinking of dropping an overlay on top of the page for a few hundred milliseconds to absorb the second click. But that feels really hacky.
[15:23:27] <grafi> how does double click oÃ´
[15:23:30] <grafi> *who even
[15:24:03] <krishna> i've observed a lot of older users doing this.
[15:24:31] <grafi> they will die eventually :x
[15:24:39] <krishna> and the users of the site tend to be older.
[15:24:40] <shoky> lol
[15:24:42] <krishna> thanks
[15:25:22] <grafi> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ krishna
[15:25:30] <grafi> maybe something like that can be helpful
[15:26:55] <shoky> sounds more like you need to rethink your interface, and how it responds to double clicks
[15:28:15] <shoky> or to multiple clicks, rather
[15:30:09] <shoky> but i haven't slept for ~35 hours so i donno what i'm talking about most likely
[15:30:28] <grafi> go to bed shoky
[15:30:36] <shoky> yessir
[15:30:40] <shoky> g'night
[15:30:43] <grafi> night :P
[15:30:48] <grafi> sweet dreams
[15:34:21] <krishna> i'm not sure where to go when I try to rethink it. i guess i could wrap all my click callbacks with a throttle function.
[15:34:35] <krishna> where all the throttled callbacks end up sharing a timeout.
[15:34:45] <grafi> sound complicated
[15:42:25] <Cameron> im using a collision script but for some reason the collisions are only recorded if there's text in the div (not an image)
[15:45:53] <grafi> collision script

[15:48:15] <batman> ive been struggling trying to generate a pdf via ajax.. is there any good library for this?
[15:48:51] <grafi> how do you mean via ajax
[15:50:54] <batman> need to create a pdf using ajax
[15:51:21] <tw2113> do you have a server side library ready to handle the request?
[15:51:28] <batman> grafi:  yes
[15:51:44] <batman> tw2113:  yes
[15:52:17] <tw2113> just checking
[15:52:21] <grafi> way to bury the lead
[15:52:53] <grafi> so what data is the backend expecting?
[15:52:54] <grafi> html?
[15:54:50] <batman> yes
[15:56:28] <grafi> so whats the problem?
[15:56:38] <grafi> have you tried anything
[15:56:49] <grafi> have you read how $.ajax works
[15:59:17] <batman> grafi:  have you ever made a pdf report?
[15:59:29] <grafi> nope
[16:00:29] <batman> ..
[16:01:20] <nesoi> could someone look at this and tell me what I'm doing wrong (probably something really dumb) http://jsfiddle.net/dZYYg/3/
[16:02:31] <grafi> "ReferenceError: one is not defined" nesoi
[16:03:35] <tw2113> perceived as variables not array values
[16:03:41] <tw2113> put them in quotes
[16:03:45] <grafi> wohoo
[16:04:51] <nesoi> grafi:  why am I not seeing any outputâ€¦ where should I be looking?
[16:05:45] <grafi> in your devtools/console/firebug?
[16:06:00] <nesoi> yeah, I was looking there, but it wasn't showing me anything
[16:06:08] <grafi> odd
[16:58:07] <reZo> Hi, I'm trying to make a bunch of 1's and 0's in a div randomly get replaced by other 1's and 0's, then finally display the words "Hello There", but am lost where to start :/, could anyone point me in the right direction? Ta
[17:12:21] <nesoi> is there a neat way to determine how much text will fit in a line and truncate so it doesn't wrap?
[17:12:39] <nesoi> I want it to be like "this is my truncated li..."
[17:17:24] <CWSpear> nesoi, this is probably most easily done with CSS
[17:17:37] <grafi> hm
[17:17:57] <CWSpear> There are hacky ways to do it was JS, but it gets tricky cuz it depends on the font used and stuff
[17:18:51] <tw2113> it'd be better to just do character limits :P
[17:18:58] <nesoi> hi CWSpear
[17:19:12] <tw2113> once it passes 100 characters, just truncate and add the ellipses
[17:19:23] <nesoi> yeah, I was hoping there was something which would calculate the widths of every character and automatically truncate
[17:19:43] <nesoi> the problem is, this is a mobile app and has to truncate differently depending on the device characteristics
[17:20:00] <tw2113> thus why it'd be best to just limit by character count
[17:20:17] <nesoi> btw, CWSpear did i tell you how I solved that pagechange not being triggered issue?
[17:20:23] <nesoi> might be a jquery bug
[17:20:58] <nesoi> tw2113:  if I limit by character count, it won't look good on different devices which are set differently
[17:21:10] <CWSpear> text-overflow: elipsis
[17:21:13] <CWSpear> ellipsis
[17:21:26] <CWSpear> but you need to do overflow: hidden on it too
[17:21:28] <tw2113> it'd look textually even to me :P
[17:21:32] <tw2113> just not visually based on 1 line
[17:21:42] <nesoi> tw2113:  not if it wraps
[17:21:56] <nesoi> CWSpear:  ah, that sounds good
[17:21:59] <tw2113> whether the same characters wrap or not, textually they're even
[17:22:03] <tw2113> just not VISUALLY
[17:22:14] <tw2113> 20 characters is 20 characters :P
[17:22:44] <tw2113> also, i think people expect text to break to many new lines on mobile these days
[17:22:49] <nesoi> tw2113:  yes, but I would like it to be one line
[17:22:54] <tw2113> not sure why
[17:22:56] <CWSpear> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/deSKz/
[17:22:58] <nesoi> it's the 1st part of a message
[17:23:04] <tw2113> and?
[17:23:15] <nesoi> beautiful CWSpear! thanks
[17:24:38] <nesoi> CWSpear:  so the problem with the pagechange not being triggered was solved when I eliminated 2 of the 3 pagechange statements I had for different pages and combined them
[17:24:49] <nesoi> not sure fi I told you that or not
[17:25:05] <CWSpear> Yeah, I think you had mentioned that. But then you had a pageinit issue
[17:25:32] <nesoi> pageinit specifies the page, so you can have multiple of them and it works
[17:25:39] <nesoi> pagechange doesn't specify the page for some odd reason
[17:25:50] <nesoi> I guess so you can wildcard it
[17:26:50] <nesoi> bbiab
[17:27:39] <nesoi> or bbias :)

[18:14:45] <Zesty> hi
[18:15:18] <aldodelgado> Question? I have a template that uses jQuery vs $ for the objects. But I want to use a plugin and the library has to many $ to have to rename them all. Is there a way I can do something with no conflict and have it load last? I'm not sure if I'm asking this correctly .
[18:17:41] <Zesty> (function($) { // stuff })(jQuery.noConflict());
[18:18:17] <aldodelgado> Zesty: Thanks I'm going to give that a try
[18:26:16] <aldodelgado> Zesty: You the bomb! Worked like a charm!
[18:31:30] <Zesty> :)
[19:41:06] <p3lim> Anyone here worked with the Ace editor that knows how I can set the theme/mode etc if I have it in a subdirectory?
[19:42:56] <grafi> editor.setTheme("ace/theme/twilight");
[19:43:04] <grafi> arent those subdirectories=?
[19:43:12] <p3lim> Yeah, but it will look for "theme-twilight" in the root
[19:43:17] <p3lim> I have everything in /libs/
[19:43:31] <p3lim> And no, those are not subdirectories
[19:43:51] <p3lim> So i can't just do .setTheme('libs/ace/theme/twilight') or something like that
[19:43:59] <grafi> then nevermind
[19:44:07] <p3lim> Yeah now you see my issue :p
[19:45:01] <p3lim> I tried asking in #ace, but that channel is silent

[20:53:45] <b0nn> hi guys; I am trying to (re)learn jquery, I got some example code for a button from a couple of websites, but I'm having problems.... I put an alert into my code, but it's not called when I click the button, can anyone offer advice?  My code is at http://pastebin.com/TWabsvBK
[21:04:11] <RRR2> are you submitting it?
[21:26:35] <EGreg> hey guys
[21:26:49] <EGreg> have you EVER found it necessary to do anything other than this.each in a jquery plugin?
[21:27:00] <EGreg> meaning, does the jquery passed to the plugin ever really matter in your plugins?
[21:27:13] <EGreg> or you apply the plugin equally to all the elements?
[21:29:22] <WG1337> Hi! Is there an event for jquery that would check if iframe content has changed?
[21:35:33] <b0nn> RRR2: I'm clicking on the link :)
[21:36:02] <RRR2> WG1337 I really don't think there is one.
[21:36:51] <RRR2> b0nn you're using "submit" not "click"
[21:37:04] <b0nn> ugh, I best learn the difference
[21:38:09] <RRR2> ..
[21:38:10] <b0nn> hm, using the definition here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/selenium-users/wcxWU-41fzI I'm submitting
[21:43:20] <b0nn> hm, changing to .click makes no difference either
[21:43:24] <b0nn> it must be the selector
[21:43:41] <b0nn> <form id="puzzle" action="solve.php">
[21:44:12] <b0nn> or not
[21:44:15] <WG1337> RRR2: oh, ok, thanks! Will need to figure out other solution for iframe size
[21:44:31] <RRR2> iframe size?
[21:44:57] <RRR2> are you checking if the iframe size has changed.. ?
[21:45:21] <RRR2> With CSS you can set different sizes so the style adjusts to the window
[21:47:05] <WG1337> The problem is that I have a page that has an iframe. Inside iframe there are php script, javascripts and more. When I press a button inside iframe, it adds few lines and that makes some parts of page invisible
[21:57:37] <b0nn> hm, ok this website is broken : http://www.jquery4u.com/dynamic-css-2/custom-css-buttons-jquery-events-tutorial/ however it does seem to be that the way I have created my button is the problem

[22:55:33] <faraway> Does anyone know how to solve this "bug" in FrieFox? (http://jsfiddle.net/aracH/1/)  The gray box jumps exactly the width of the scrollbar. And when i resize the window it jumps back to its correct position.
[22:59:50] <faraway> Ah never mind. Rephrased my search query and found some answers about the problem.
[23:00:02] <faraway> Seems to be a known bug about fixed posisiton
[23:10:30] <rubeez> Hi, can anyone help me out with form validation issue, see http://jsfiddle.net/3qYpM/129/ for code and issue.
[23:11:20] <Cork> faraway: should be fixed if your running an up to date firefox
[23:11:34] <Cork> but yes, it was a known bug in ff21
[23:11:40] <CWSpear> rubeez: You need the http://
[23:11:46] <faraway> Cork: 22.0 os x
[23:11:53] <CWSpear> then it seemed to work as desired
[23:13:44] <Cork> faraway: ah, dam sorry; i was off one version :)
[23:13:50] <rubeez> CWSpear: yeh when a user chooses to enter a url it must have http correct. But when user decides to no longer input a url and clears the field (as its optional) the popup remains
[23:14:01] <Cork> known bug for 22 fixed in 23 :D (and it is in beta 3)
[23:14:54] <rubeez> CWSpear: the problem is that the optional field isnt in the successList object once cleared. i need a way to find out its no longer an error
[23:18:51] <CWSpear> rubeezâ€¦ ah
[23:19:00] <CWSpear> um, idk, lol. I don't like the jQuery validate plugin
[23:19:09] <faraway> Cork: np â€¦ one the one hand it is good to know that it is fixed. Sad thing when looking at our stats there are still some update denier. I could always slap the people who turn of auto update ^^
[23:19:36] <rubeez>  ha ok np, thanks anyways. Perhaps someone else can help me http://jsfiddle.net/3qYpM/129/ for code and issue.
[23:19:41] <faraway> dev excluded :D
[23:19:49] <Cork> faraway: ah, but ff21 and prev shouldn't have the problem if i remember correctly
[23:20:03] <CWSpear> sorry rubeez, I gotta go. good luck
[23:20:11] <rubeez> CWSpear: cheers
[23:20:35] <faraway> so an 21 and 22 exclusive problem ?
[23:21:19] <Cork> faraway: it was a regression, not sure what version exactly; but i could check it out if you like
[23:25:16] <faraway> Cork: no you don't need, but thx. I think that i can figure out the last infos myself. I just need to either use a workaround or to keep a note for the situation where this is reported as bug of the application. But that something  i need to discuss later with the customer. For now i'll make a fix.
[23:25:30] <Cork> faraway: for refs https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844178
[23:26:37] <rubeez> Hey Cork, when you are available can you help me?
[23:27:11] <Cork> rubeez: just ask the question, and if someone knows the answer they will help you

[23:41:49] <rubeez> Cork: empties the field. user changes mind and doesnt want to enter a url
[23:44:59] <devslash> do you need a plugin if I want to play a sound bite using jquery ?
[23:47:53] <Cork> devslash: depends what you mean "using jquery"
[23:48:04] <Cork> devslash: and depends on how you want to play the sound
[23:50:07] <CapMax> hi
[23:50:26] <CapMax> this project, fines a class, and at the end does this; jQuery(function() { var obj = new Object(); });
[23:50:37] <CapMax> just wondering how do I access this object from the html?
[23:50:46] <Cork> you can't
[23:50:51] <CapMax> i cant?
[23:50:55] <Cork> it's a private variable
[23:50:56] <CapMax> should it be global?
[23:51:11] <Cork> CapMax: also you shouldn't put js in your html
[23:51:19] <CapMax> it needs to have php in it
[23:51:23] <CapMax> so theres no choice
[23:51:41] <Cork> why do you need php in your js?
[23:51:48] <devslash> cork i want to play an audio file, no controls just play the sound
[23:51:53] <CapMax> do set a whole bunch of stuff which comes from the database
[23:52:28] <Cork> devslash: you can the audio api, you have the <audio> tag, you have embed or object; so still depends on how you want to do it
[23:52:31] <devslash> CapMax, you want javascript to access a php variable
[23:52:38] <devslash> im trying but its not working
[23:52:41] <Cork> devslash: that isn't the problem
[23:53:09] <Cork> CapMax: so store the php values in variables (json?), and then access it from your js
[23:53:34] <ph88> \o
[23:53:47] <Cork> ~~~~~~~~\o
[23:53:47] <CapMax> Cork: js cant access mysql last time i checked
[23:53:54] <ph88> lol
[23:54:19] <Cork> CapMax: uh, for things to happen client side you have to store it in the webpage
[23:54:26] <ph88> CapMax: try node.js for that :P
[23:54:32] <CapMax> very much effort
[23:54:35] <CapMax> zero reward
[23:54:49] <Cork> CapMax: ok, then if you really meant access it from php
[23:54:57] <Cork> then the answer is what devslash said... you can't
[23:55:06] <Cork> thought you actually generated js from php
[23:55:06] <CapMax> what? i already fixed it
[23:55:08] <devslash> well yes and no
[23:55:11] <CapMax> just made the variable global
[23:55:20] <devslash> ive had a situation like that and i did something like this
[23:55:32] <devslash> i wanted js to have access to a php variable
[23:55:44] <CapMax> no....js has a function which access json data which is produced by php, which is passed in through controller and view which has the js in html
[23:55:52] <devslash> i did this (assuming your php generates the html page
[23:56:05] <Cork> CapMax: so do what i said before
[23:56:11] <rubeez> Cork: any ideas?
[23:56:21] <devslash> var myvar=<?php echo $vartoshare; ?>;
[23:56:23] <Cork> rubeez: no, not good thought with the validator plugin
[23:56:27] <CapMax> Cork: what? it already works, why do any further work
[23:56:50] <Cork> CapMax: cause the code structure becomes messy for no reason
[23:57:03] <Cork> but hey, it's your mess do what you want
[23:57:11] <rubeez> Cork: thanks for having a look at it
[23:58:03] <Cork> rubeez: what i can tell from looking at it, is that for some reason, making the url field empty does't mark it as a success element
[23:59:19] <CapMax> i wouldnt say its messy, its just a couple of lines
