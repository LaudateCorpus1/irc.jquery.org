[00:24:25] <jax> hi
[00:24:36] <jax> how do i get the the nearest parent div with class x ?
[00:27:34] <jax> got it
[00:35:36] <jax> i got this dom: <div><div class="x">..</div><div id="x"></div></div>. how can i get the div with class="x" from inside the div id="x" ?
[00:35:56] <jax> i try: $('#x').closest('div.x')
[00:43:51] <Cork> $('
[00:43:53] <Cork> opps
[00:44:13] <Cork> jax: $('#x').prevAll('.x').first()
[00:45:15] <Cork> jax: closest stands for "closest parent", not closest tag in a tag soup
[00:47:03] <jax> ok
[00:47:06] <jax> got it, thanks!
[00:50:56] <otiuk> is there a way to insert some html into the previous list element when clicking a link?
[00:51:14] <Cork> previous?
[00:51:36] <optiqal> There's always a way to insert some html
[00:51:38] <Cork> as clicking a link in an <li> and inserting html in an earlier <li> element?
[00:51:44] <otiuk> i have a list.. and i want to have it when you click a link in a list item have it insert an element into the previous list item
[00:52:25] <Cork> $(this).closest('li').prev().html('new html');
[00:53:04] <otiuk> will that replace the html that is in the previous list item or will it add to it?
[00:53:11] <Cork> replace
[00:53:18] <otiuk> i need it to add the code to the end
[00:53:21] <Cork> you can use append/prepend if you prefer
[00:53:28] <otiuk> should i use append instead of html?
[00:54:23] <optiqal> use append if you are adding it to the end of the html you are targeting
[00:54:36] <otiuk> ok lemme try this out
[00:54:44] <optiqal> prepend if you want to add it to the beginning
[00:55:01] <optiqal> prepend and append will both add the html inside the targeted tag though
[00:55:10] <optiqal> targeted element rather
[00:55:29] <Cork> ya, if you want to insert a new li element it would be something like
[00:55:39] <micw> hi
[00:55:50] <Cork> $(this).closest('li').before('<li>html</li>')
[00:56:44] <micw> will jQuery(...).fadeOut().css(...).attr(...).fadeIn() execute the things between the both fades within the queue or immediately?
[00:56:56] <Cork> immediately
[00:57:13] <Cork> jQuery(...).fadeOut().css(...).attr(...).fadeIn() is the same as jQuery(...).css(...).attr(...).fadeOut().fadeIn()
[00:57:29] <micw> is there a simply way to queue it as well?
[00:57:40] <Cork> not really
[00:58:04] <micw> background: i want to switch pages displayed in iframes and fade them over. seams that (at least on chrome) the iframe is not loading if it is invisible
[00:58:05] <Cork> there is some hacks you can use with defferes, but normally the simplest is to just use setTimeout
[00:58:16] <Cork> uh, sorry meant the callbacks
[00:58:23] <Cork> what the hell was i thinking there...
[00:58:38] <otiuk> if($(this).next('div').attr('class') == "blah") { <-- would this not work to detect if you click a link to find out if the next div's class has "blah"?
[00:59:01] <Cork> micw: jQuery(..., function() { $(this).css(...).attr(...).fadeIn(); }).fadeOut()
[00:59:23] <Cork> otiuk: don't use attr or prop to check for classes
[00:59:36] <Cork> ?.hasClass @ otiuk
[00:59:36] <bot-t> otiuk, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[00:59:44] <otiuk> this link is in a div.. i want to detect if the div after the one it's contained in has blah
[01:00:13] <Cork> otiuk: and no the code before the attr would check if the next element is a div and has only the class blah
[01:00:26] <Cork> if the next class is something else it will not return anything
[01:00:32] <Cork> sorry next element
[01:01:24] <otiuk> if($(this).next('div').hasClass('blah')) { <-- that wouldn't work either?
[01:01:29] <Cork> otiuk: <a><span></span><div></div> $('a').click(function() { $(this).next('div').length == 0 });
[01:01:40] <Cork> otiuk: <a><div></div> $('a').click(function() { $(this).next('div').length == 1 });
[01:01:44] <micw> Cork, callbac toes the job (a bit different: fadeOut(duraktion,function() { el.css().attr() }).fadeIn()
[01:01:58] <slartsa> Sorry to be a newbie, but why would this work with jquery mobile 1.2.0 but not with 1.3.0* ? http://jsfiddle.net/mWt6Q/48/
[01:01:58] <Cork> otiuk: you need to use nextAll('div').first()
[01:03:01] <otiuk> like:  if($(this).nextAll('div').first().hasClass('blah')) {  or?
[01:03:32] <otiuk> just tested that and it doesn't work
[01:04:20] <natas77> hi guys i am looking for a parallax scrolling plug-in. dou you guys have e suggest for me?
[01:04:28] <Cork> slartsa: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/mWt6Q/50/
[01:05:00] <Cork> otiuk: yes, that should be how it would work; if it doesn't i need to see the html structure
[01:05:07] <otiuk> so i have... <div class="blah1"><a href="#">click here</a></div><div class="blah">woot</div> .. and if you click the link i want it to see if the next element has the class "blah"
[01:05:17] <slartsa> Cork: so 1.9.1 is a no-no?
[01:05:34] <otiuk> in the very next div
[01:05:48] <Cork> ostlund: $(this).closest('blah1').next().hasClass('blah')
[01:06:00] <natas77> i find this one : https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr and SUPERSCROLLORAMA
[01:06:03] <Cork> otiuk: its not the next div, its a sibling to the parent, not the link
[01:06:22] <Cork> slartsa: 1.3 errors out with 1.9 in jsfiddle at least
[01:06:53] <slartsa> yep. but didn't work on my server either
[01:06:58] <Cork> uh... wtf... it did... but not when i try it again...
[01:07:05] <slartsa> well that's a bad thing :/
[01:07:51] <Cork> ok, i have to retract that statement... can't reproduce the $.event. error i got before...
[01:09:56] <Cork> slartsa: ya, it looks like prop('disabled') isn't monitored by jqm
[01:10:11] <Cork> not sure who it is meant to be done though
[01:14:43] <otiuk> cork:  see:  http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/
[01:17:22] <BillTheButcher> downloaded initializr. Why is jQuery loaded like this:         <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[01:17:57] <Cork> uh...
[01:18:28] <Cork> someone tries to do a horrible fallback solution for if the original one doesn't load
[01:19:04] <BillTheButcher> okay
[01:20:30] <Cork> slartsa: http://jsfiddle.net/mWt6Q/52/
[01:20:51] <natas77> guys i am looking for a good parallax scrolling plug-in. any suggestions? pls
[01:22:00] <Cork> otiuk: http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/1/
[01:22:11] <Cork> otiuk: though please don't abuse the a tag
[01:23:06] <Cork> otiuk: this is how you should do it http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/2/
[01:27:44] <Cork> otiuk: or if you want to be really correct http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/3/
[01:40:13] <Hooloovo1> Cork: why is that fallback horrible?
[01:40:46] <Cork> Hooloovo1: cause it depends on writeing script tags with the help of document.write
[01:42:30] <Cork> Hooloovo1: <script id="jquerysrc" src="org"></script><script>if(window.jQuery === undefined) { document.getElementById('jquerysrc').src = 'new source'; }</script> should do it without the hackiness
[01:42:30] <neon__> hi guys  i need some help in a jquery plugin, http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-dropdown/
[01:44:12] <Hooloovo1> Cork: Hmm, well using that document.write is widely used. It's even in the html5boilerplate.
[01:44:55] <Cork> Hooloovo1: document.write is a legacy command from pre dom standards
[01:45:11] <Cork> it has loads of risky effects on the page
[01:45:32] <Cork> where one of the worst is that it might blow away the entire document and leave you with an empty page
[01:46:03] <Cork> my recommendation is, and has been for a LONG time to never ever use it
[01:47:05] <neon__>  the drop down closes when I right click on a link in firefox. it does not stays open like it stays in chrome and ie. how to avoid this?  http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-dropdown/
[01:47:29] <Hooloovo1> Cork: Hmmm, yea i kinda feel that whole fallback thing is unnecessary anyways.
[01:47:38] <Cork> Hooloovo1: ya
[01:48:06] <Cork> it you don't trust the third party you shouldn't be loading the file from there to start with
[01:48:43] <Hooloovo1> Exactly. Much easier to just load it from the same place you load everything else.
[01:49:30] <Cork> Hooloovo1: well there is one reason to load it from a common cdn
[01:49:50] <Cork> the browser has quite a high probability to have the library already in its cache
[01:49:58] <Cork> so you don't get the load time from the library
[01:50:06] <Hooloovo1> Well, yeeea.
[01:50:07] <Hooloovo1> But
[01:50:38] <Hooloovo1> how big is jquery?
[01:50:43] <Hooloovo1> like 50kb?
[01:50:45] <Hooloovo1> 100?
[01:51:04] <Cork> the size of a compleate ide from the 90's :D
[01:51:31] <Hooloovo1> There's a LOOOT of other optimizations that'll give you a bigger boost to load times.
[01:51:48] <Hooloovo1> When you have those done you can start experimenting with loading jquery from a cdn. :P
[01:52:15] <Cork> Hooloovo1: javascript loads synchronous
[01:52:26] <Cork> so that means the page holds when it hits the script tags in the header
[01:52:52] <Cork> until it has contacted the server, downloaded the javascript, parsed the javascript, executed the javascript
[01:52:59] <Hooloovo1> That's only a problem if you do two things.
[01:53:06] <Hooloovo1> Put scripts in the header
[01:53:09] <Cork> on a line with high latency (read mobile) it can be a significant time
[01:53:10] <Hooloovo1> and doesn't minify things
[01:53:18] <Cork> no
[01:53:44] <Cork> the actual round trip from server to client is the problem, the payload is less of a probelm
[01:53:55] <Cork> as mobile networks now days is quite fast
[01:54:16] <Hooloovo1> Yes, but there will only be one JS file to request if you minify them.
[01:54:16] <Cork> as in it can ship quit a lot of data when it finally starts
[01:54:26] <Cork> Hooloovo1: true
[01:54:49] <Hooloovo1> But still, optimizing images and using sprites still gives a bigger boost for most sites.
[01:54:51] <Cork> but then you also have higher risk of evicting other librarys from the users browser cache
[01:55:52] <Cork> also supportingly often just concating the librarys and zlibbing helps more then minifying
[01:56:18] <Cork> (concating is the important part as it removes network connections)
[01:56:20] <Hooloovo1> Cork: You can't get it all. Minifying with a single JS files > than the chance of getting one JS file from the browser cache imho.
[01:56:40] <Hooloovo1> a single JS file*
[01:56:45] <Cork> Hooloovo1: you can, if you use common cdn's for common caches, you get both
[01:56:54] <Cork> *common librarys
[01:57:09] <Cork> then they will have the library in the browser cache, so no need to download anything == no delay
[01:57:20] <Cork> less cache churn, and better performance all over
[01:57:34] <Cork> so there is a reason for using cdns
[01:57:52] <Hooloovo1> I'm not saying it's pointless.
[01:58:17] <Hooloovo1> Just that being anal about that stuff isn't what will give 99% of the sites out the the best boost to load times.
[01:58:18] <Cork> Hooloovo1: btw my example from before was broken; forgot that document.getElementById doens't work in head
[01:58:28] <Hooloovo1> There's 1000 things they can do that'll do a bigger difference.
[01:59:03] <Cork> Hooloovo1: well it is a simple thing you can do that will help you and other sites
[01:59:10] <Cork> so it really is an all around win
[02:52:25] <amaroks> I want an input to pass these rules (Starts with + or digits and ends with 6 digits or more )
[02:52:25] <amaroks> I'm using ^(\+|\d)+\d{6,}$
[02:52:25] <amaroks> can ti be improved or its fine?
[03:01:59] <doebi> how to change a images 'src' using jquery?
[03:02:27] <doebi> i tried $('img').src and $('img').attr('src', url)
[03:02:46] <natas77> and?
[03:02:49] <doebi> none worked

[03:03:56] <natas77> this one works

[03:13:27] <Anticom> hi all
[03:13:45] <Anticom> i'm trying to get datepicker to act like a month picker giving me the last day of a month, the month and year
[03:13:46] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/6Uev5/
[03:14:08] <Anticom> if you try to set the date some more times it's behaving weird jumping like 5 years ahead
[03:14:13] <Anticom> what's going wrong there?
[03:16:45] <tankblergh> hi!
[03:18:14] <tankblergh> Im using knockout JS, and I have a text-binding. I want to change the class of this element based on the value returned
[03:18:22] <tankblergh> any suggestions how to best do this?
[03:21:02] <rich97> Hey I'm having a little problem unbinding the events bound with Backbone. I'm following the advice found here (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12359604/unbind-backbone-view-events) but I'm using an older verison of jQuery (1.4.3) which doesn't have the off() methods, can someone suggest what the equivalent legacy code is?
[03:24:46] <rich97> Nevermind. Found undelegate()!
[03:39:22] <pingec> is there a naming convetion for promises ?
[03:40:17] <Cork> not what i know of
[03:45:36] <soee> i have some html content returned by ajax call, now how can i get only some part of it (for example that is inside #foo element) ?
[03:46:18] <Cork> is #foo the outer most element in the fragment or is it a child?
[03:46:24] <sammich> you could use .load()
[03:46:39] <Krambiorix> hi, jQuery.inArray always returns 1 ,  --> jQuery.inArray(addresses[j].parentgroup, parents)   --> What am i doing wrong?
[03:46:50] <sammich> or, alternatively, load the result into $(response).find()
[03:47:00] <soee> Cork, child
[03:47:04] <Cork> $(data).find('#foo') if it is a child $(data).filter('#foo') if it is the outermost
[03:47:39] <Cork> Krambiorix: what is parentgroup and parents?
[03:48:02] <Cork> ?p
[03:48:03] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:49:34] <Krambiorix> Cork,  parentgroup = "test" and parents = [];
[03:49:39] <Krambiorix> -> empty array
[03:50:48] <soee> Cork, works, thank you
[03:50:51] <Cork> Krambiorix: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/uAvWW/
[03:51:19] <Cork> soee: np
[03:54:43] <Krambiorix> Cork, thanks, solved!! the var parents = []; was in a loop...
[03:58:05] <Anticom> hi Cork :]
[03:58:13] <Cork> hi
[03:59:00] <Anticom> maybe you can help me out with this. I've modded the datepicker to act as a month picker giving me the last day of month (+month & year). http://jsfiddle.net/6Uev5/
[03:59:19] <Anticom> works fine so far but if you try to change the date again it jumps like 5 years ahead and acts all weird
[03:59:24] <Anticom> any idea, what's going wrong?
[03:59:46] <timini> Hi, I'm quite new to jQuery and have started working on some projects that have quite large client side scripts. I'd like to learn some best practices for organising JS, mayby using class based stuff. Can anyone recommend and articles / books / reading?
[04:00:32] <Anticom> timini if you want to use jQuery for like HUGE client side scripts that build a whole application you should use it with knockout.js or backbone.js etc
[04:00:41] <Anticom> just dig right into those
[04:01:34] <Anticom> usually jQuery is just used as a swiss army knife in terms of javascript. I mean some widgets for user interaction or some magick how forms behave, form validation and stuff like that
[04:01:39] <Anticom> but nothing too fancy
[04:01:41] <sammich> hmm, I should've looked into that before I started my current project. Then again, it's not really 'HUGE'
[04:01:55] <Anticom> ^_^
[04:02:11] <sammich> what's 'HUGE'?
[04:02:43] <sammich> I've built some noobish mega-file as a learner to jQuery that was a few k
[04:02:46] <Anticom> sammich more than some widgets and preventing some form submission to show a jq-ui dialog before submitting the form... tweaks are not HUGE
[04:02:57] <sammich> lines*
[04:03:03] <Anticom> sammich are you familiar with the term spaghetti code? ;)
[04:03:17] <sammich> it's commented in my head ;)
[04:03:33] <Anticom> sammich however there are jquery plugins out there that have a couple of k lines uncompressed... they still are organised and well developed
[04:04:00] <Cork> Anticom: you have 51 months in you're years? :D
[04:04:18] <Anticom> Cork wut?
[04:04:19] <Anticom> ^^
[04:04:32] <Anticom> why?
[04:04:33] <Cork> 2013
[04:04:33] <Cork> 51

[04:05:04] <Anticom> Cork i've googled around to find a way in js to get the last day of month
[04:05:46] <Anticom> dafuq... how is this happening?!
[04:06:46] <Anticom> the values for the select's options are correct
[04:07:06] <Anticom> reaching from 1 to 11
[04:07:40] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/6Uev5/2/
[04:07:52] <snorti> http://jsfiddle.net/BfUqs/ how can i set the teaserbox to stay visible when i move down in it. and also my #navigation should not open the #navi div
[04:07:53] <Cork> ?eval "5" + 1
[04:07:58] <bot-t> Cork: "51"
[04:08:02] <Cork> Anticom: ^
[04:08:11] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("5", 10) + 1
[04:08:11] <bot-t> Cork: 6
[04:08:12] <Anticom> good old js base issue?
[04:08:24] <sammich> oh, wow, yeah that's a classic weak typing bug
[04:08:27] <Cork> no your adding to a string
[04:08:27] <Anticom> oh it's concated
[04:08:32] <Anticom> .__.
[04:08:38] <Anticom> arghhh fuuuuuu :D
[04:08:39] <Anticom> i hate js
[04:08:40] <Anticom> ^^
[04:08:53] <Cork> also i removed the unneeded :selected selector
[04:09:10] <Cork> opps but i forgot the day fix
[04:09:21] <Anticom> what day fix?
[04:09:38] <Anticom> day is set correctly, isn't it?
[04:09:42] <Cork> forget it
[04:09:51] <Cork> you already did the correct thing :)
[04:10:02] <Cork> 0 will give you the last day in the previous month
[04:10:08] <Anticom> um btw, how can those selectors working properly? i mean for month & year
[04:10:22] <Anticom> i mean if i got more than one datepicker in my document
[04:10:31] <Cork> ah
[04:10:37] <Cork> it won't
[04:10:44] <Cork> unless they reuse the same element
[04:11:17] <sammich> I think there's just a single window getting redrawn
[04:11:24] <sammich> div*
[04:11:43] <Anticom> Cork ..which is what the widget factory usually intends to do (?)
[04:12:08] <Cork> if i remeber correctly you can have multiple date pickers visible
[04:12:11] <Cork> it can be inline
[04:12:18] <Anticom> hm
[04:12:35] <Anticom> let me check on that. I'll report in a couple of minutes
[04:12:42] <Anticom> Cork btw u made my day once again =)
[04:12:44] <sammich> yup. just inspect. Inspector is your best friend
[04:15:53] <sammich> can I just drop a $('<script>rules</script>') in the body and it'll apply immediately?
[04:15:59] <sammich> oops, style*
[04:16:02] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/6Uev5/4/
[04:16:28] <Cork> sammich: yes
[04:20:35] <Anticom> sammich question is why would you do that
[04:20:50] <sammich> I'm injecting code into a page with greasemonkey
[04:21:05] <Cork> sammich: inject it in the head then
[04:21:18] <Cork> document.head.appendNode(style);
[04:21:49] <sammich> yeah, I used jQuery for the question, but I'm not really using jQ
[04:21:49] <Anticom> Cork just so i understand it. dpDiv is a property set by the ui widget factory, right?
[04:22:15] <Cork> it's a member of the inst object that is the object it self
[04:22:36] <Anticom> but it's specific to the datepicker (?)
[04:22:45] <Cork> Anticom: so by using the variable dpDiv you will get the widgets dom element
[04:22:51] <snorti> jsfiddle.net/s57B5/ how can i set the teaserbox to stay visible when i move down in it. and also my #navigation should not open the #navi div.. grml
[04:23:04] <Cork> Anticom: of course it is, as it is the datepickers own variable
[04:23:26] <Anticom> Cork no i meant wether e.g. an accordeon would have the dpDiv aswell
[04:23:28] <Anticom> or a tooltip
[04:23:46] <Cork> snorti: i answered this the last time you asked; you can't use hover
[04:24:02] <Cork> Anticom: they might; what does it matter?
[04:24:21] <Anticom> just trying to understand what the rules are and what's going on :p
[04:24:33] <snorti> Cork: should i use onmousein?
[04:24:33] <Anticom> I should take some time and get comfy with the widget stuff i guess
[04:24:44] <mdunham918_> did i do this right:  http://cdpn.io/mqiCj
[04:24:50] <sammich> you're basically accessing data that belongs to the widget itself, much like any class object
[04:24:56] <Cork> snorti: you can use mouseenter, but mouseleave would give the same problem you have now
[04:25:09] <snorti> :(
[04:25:14] <Cork> snorti: you can't tell why the mouse leaves the area
[04:25:15] <snorti> i aint get rid of it
[04:25:26] <Cork> snorti: simplest thing to do is to have it switch when a new value comes
[04:25:30] <Cork> and never hide them
[04:25:52] <snorti> can you show me?
[04:25:57] <Cork> though that would still make it tricky to move down there when you are on the top row (you would have to move in between the bottom buttons)
[04:26:08] <snorti> hm
[04:26:48] <sammich> that's really a usability thing, so you'd need to make it a single row
[04:27:11] <mdunham918_> i updated my code pen:  http://cdpn.io/mqiCj    I'm trying to build a simple circular gallery piece and I reduced the code to basically 3 functions
[04:27:14] <sammich> unless you put in a delay or some sort before the change takes place
[04:27:28] <mdunham918_> i just want to know I'm on the right path with this clone append remove deal
[04:27:48] <pingec> Is "$.when([]).then(function(){...})" a valid statement?
[04:27:51] <Cork> snorti: this is in no way complete, it just shows the basics http://jsfiddle.net/s57B5/2/
[04:28:24] <Cork> pingec: i think it is
[04:28:33] <Cork> it wouldn't do anything though
[04:31:23] <pingec> Cork it executes the then callback
[04:31:45] <Cork> ah, that might be logical
[04:34:53] <mdunham918_> is there a better way to move the first li in a ul to the bottom so its the last li in the ul other than using clone(true, true).appendTo()
[04:37:38] <snorti> Cork: can you show me this in my fiddl?
[04:37:48] <snorti> thx
[04:37:52] <snorti> i will look
[04:38:48] <Cork> mdunham918_: why not just $(this).appendTo('ul') ?
[04:39:02] <Cork> or do you want to copy it not move?
[04:39:15] <mdunham918_> having an issue with css3 transitions not working properly
[04:39:25] <mdunham918_> checkout my js code: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mqiCj
[04:39:48] <mdunham918_> also the transition doesn't work unless i wrap the remove in a setTimeout
[04:40:35] <mdunham918_> just wondering if the clone append remove technique u see there is stable and not going to eat memory
[04:40:41] <mdunham918_> or best practice i guess
[04:40:47] <doebi> all Objects i define in my $(handler) arent accessible in global scope, how can i make them accessble?
[04:42:18] <Cork> mdunham918_: what you would have to do is detach the element from the page, trigger a reflow and then append it again
[04:42:35] <Cork> mdunham918_: and yes, clone will use up memory
[04:42:36] <sammich> doebi: put them in the global scope
[04:42:49] <mdunham918_> hmm i'll play around with detach
[04:43:03] <sammich> define a variable in that scope, then inside your handler, assign your object to that var
[04:43:04] <Cork> doebi: window.variable_you_want_in_the_global_scope = value;
[04:43:43] <sammich> ah, the venerable window object, I've much to learn
[04:44:37] <Cork> mdunham918_: and a reflow isn't triggered through timer, use something as simple as $(ul).height()
[04:44:52] <Cork> the timer isn't needed
[04:45:01] <develkar> hello everyone
[04:45:55] <develkar> I am not sure, I am doing this right. I want to set the margin of the image based on its dimensions...
[04:46:00] <develkar> here is my code : http://paste2.org/t1DNIHhA
[04:46:04] <sammich> can you not use call document selectors in an IIFE?
[04:46:15] <sammich> Pretty sure that's false
[04:46:55] <Cork> develkar: no 100% would be 100% of the height of the parent element
[04:47:14] <Cork> sammich: iife?
[04:47:24] <sammich> (function() {} ()
[04:47:30] <sammich> oops )
[04:47:31] <mdunham918_> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mqiCj    :-D check it out I think i got a better solution now
[04:47:39] <sammich> immediately invoke func expression
[04:47:43] <mdunham918_> hmm
[04:47:47] <sammich> immediately invoked function expression
[04:47:48] <Cork> mdunham918_: can't the page doens't parse here
[04:47:59] <Cork> codepen.io is junk for me and has been for a long time
[04:48:13] <mdunham918_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mqiCj
[04:48:16] <mdunham918_> doesn't parse?
[04:48:24] <Cork> i only get a black page
[04:48:29] <mdunham918_> you on crhome?
[04:48:30] <mdunham918_> chrome
[04:48:40] <Cork> chrome, firefox opera doesn't matter
[04:48:45] <mdunham918_> weird
[04:48:53] <mdunham918_> i'll try fiddle
[04:49:00] <develkar> Cork, I'm setting the max-height so that it gets applied to the image. I want to set the margin on the basis of its height
[04:49:18] <Cork> develkar: like i said, you can't
[04:49:55] <Cork> develkar: first for that to work the parent would have to have a specified height, else that value will be ignored by the browser
[04:50:08] <Cork> and then 100% will mean the img will have the same height as the parent
[04:50:45] <mdunham918_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/  I've tried a few ways but only setTimeout seems to work
[04:50:52] <mdunham918_> but no more clone
[04:51:02] <Cork> <div style="height: 355px"><img style="min-height: 100%"></div> img.height == 355px
[04:51:07] <Cork> develkar: ^
[04:52:00] <mdunham918_> should work easily both ways just by switching appendTo with prependTo this has got to be the easiest slider yet
[04:52:01] <Cork> mdunham918_: at least make the page none webkit centric
[04:52:10] <mdunham918_> i plan to
[04:52:19] <mdunham918_> just didn't want to add all the prefixes for this test
[04:52:35] <develkar> Cork, I have mentioned that I'm applying max-height and not min-height so that the image doesn't scale to fit the size. In this case the image doesn't take full size of the container
[04:53:15] <develkar> only takes so much height so that it doesn't scale beyond its original aspect ratio
[04:56:14] <Cork> mdedetrich: http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/1/ ?
[04:56:33] <Cork> hmm nope
[04:56:37] <mdedetrich> huh?
[04:56:50] <Cork> ah, ya of course need to wait for the animation first
[04:56:52] <mdedetrich> Cork: u ding the wrong person?
[04:57:03] <Cork> ya
[04:57:09] <Cork> *mdunham918_:
[04:57:14] <mdedetrich> back to supernatural
[04:57:15] <mdedetrich> hmph
[04:57:50] <Cork> mdunham918_: what you need to do additionally is use the transisionEnd event
[04:58:09] <Cork> sadly its called differently in different browsers >_<
[04:59:47] <neggg> not even javascript related, but why does it shows img src urls in print view, urls crash my layout, how to disable it?? !? thanks !  http://www.upload.ee/image/3387997/Untitled.png http://www.upload.ee/image/3387998/Untitled2.png
[04:59:48] <Cork> mdunham918_: there we go http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/3/
[05:01:16] <Cork> mdunham918_: and a cleaned up version http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/5/
[05:02:10] <Cork> neggg: we can't debug screenshots...
[05:02:17] <Cork> and also most likely => #css
[05:14:38] <seutje> neggg: print css probably contains rules like img::after { content: attr(src); display: inline; }
[05:16:48] <Anticom> Cork can i pm u?

[05:35:04] <tankblergh> hi! I'm using Knockout.js and I have a css binding on a span element. I would like to change to change the css class of the parent of this element, based on value of the observable. I can do it like this css:{ 'class_true' : observableName} to change the current elements class, but how do I change it's parents class?
[05:35:43] <__machine> i have a list of coordinates and i want to create an object and animate it briefly in sequence from the list... how can i trigger the animations sequentially and not asynchroneously?
[05:37:12] <remybach> __machine: Queue? http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[05:37:56] <__machine> that seems to be a queue of actions on a single element?
[05:39:15] <sammich> animations on a single element are automatically queued
[05:39:56] <__machine> i want to sequentially create and insert elements and do a short 100ms animation... then do the next element etc
[05:40:10] <seutje> `g jquery animation sequence
[05:40:11] <b-ot> seutje: .queue() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[05:40:18] <seutje> b-ot: NOH!
[05:40:28] <seutje> __machine: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4204433/jquery-animation-sequence
[05:42:40] <__machine> seutje: so i just call delay() and increment the value each call by the duration of the animation
[05:43:15] <seutje> __machine: yeah, it beats the hassle of creating a custom queue to put them all on
[05:43:23] <seutje> hastle* (?)
[05:43:34] <seutje> `g hassle or hastle
[05:43:34] <b-ot> seutje: hassle - definition of hassle by the Free Online Dictionary ... → http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hassle
[05:43:47] * seutje high-fives b-ot
[05:44:35] <__machine> would making many items with long delays (hundreds of elements) cause performance issue? what about recursively calling a function that creates an element, animates it, and calls itself in the animation callback?
[05:46:08] <seutje> delay doesn't matter
[05:46:42] <seutje> hundreds of elements shouldn't be a problem on anything greater than a P133
[05:47:31] <seutje> thousands/millions could be a problem, but that issue is completely agnostic from the whole delay thing, aside from the fact that you might wanna inject them in 1 go
[05:48:03] <seutje> but with an endless loop, u can't predetermine the amount of elements of course
[05:51:43] <mydog2> morning..
[05:52:32] <mydog2> trying to figure out how to return a json/obj from a successful ajax call to the calling parent function...    i've pasted a chunk of what i have... http://pastebin.com/FGB3dNMY <<
[05:53:42] <sammich> async:false?
[05:53:47] <seutje> mydog2: ajax requests can't "return" anything
[05:53:55] <seutje> also return in a statement, not a function
[05:53:56] <mydog2> basically, in the ajax call, in the success portion, the "data" obj is there..
[05:54:14] <seutje> `ajax
[05:54:22] <seutje> where is that 101 image again
[05:54:27] <seutje> `ajax101
[05:54:27] <b-ot> seutje: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:55:23] <mdunham918_> Cork: just FYI I got next and previous working also :-D  http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/16/  thanks for your help
[05:56:02] <mdunham918_> now just not sure how to handle if someone clicks on something other than next or previous
[05:56:53] <sammich> var response; $.ajax({url:'path', async:false}).done(function(data) { response = data; });
[05:57:27] <sammich> though, using that isn't great for UI responsiveness
[05:59:15] <krzyko> Good day. I've read that jQuery 2.x policy for opera is "current version -1". So I'd like to ask if problems with opera 11.10 version should be considered as errors, or is this version out of support?
[06:00:03] <sammich> just in case you didn't get it, not really good on the ping ettique here
[06:00:08] <sammich> mydog2: see the above?
[06:04:16] <dan2k3k4> in general is it better to do $(body).ready or $(document).ready ?
[06:04:35] <remybach> $(document).ready
[06:05:35] <remybach> Better done as:
[06:05:35] <remybach> jQuery(function($) {
[06:05:35] <remybach> 	/* code */
[06:05:35] <remybach> });
[06:06:09] <dan2k3k4> remybach: since $ needs to wait till jQuery is loaded?
[06:08:34] <remybach> To be totally honest, I'm not exactly sure why… both are essentially the same afaik, this way is just shorter.
[06:10:32] <tankblergh> hi! I'm using Knockout.js and I have a css binding on a span element. I would like to change to change the css class of the parent of this element, based on value of the observable. I can do it like this css:{ 'class_true' : observableName} to change the current elements class, but how do I change it's parents class?
[06:12:09] <mydog2> hey sammich  - yep.. looking over articles now.. thanks..
[06:12:59] <mydog2> but sammich  - i saw a couple of articles that said the "async:false" was depreciated in the later versions of jquery..
[06:14:30] <mydog2> for my purpose.. when the ajax completes, and in the success portion.. i can simply pass the returned data to a subordinate child function which would then repopulate the ui/clientside page
[06:15:15] <sammich> yeah, I wasn't too sure about that, all I saw was that $.deferred used was deprecated
[06:15:42] <sammich> but in any case, just end that function where you call the ajax and continue from the callback
[06:21:42] <skione> Hi, I am setting a cookie from one subdomain (domain1.domain.com) and setting it like this: setcookie("OpenOffer", $xid, time()+3600,"/", ".domain.com") and I am trying to read it by using AJAX to something like domain1.domain.com/getCookie.php which has code like this: echo $_COOKIE["OpenOffer"]; If I go to the URL directly the cookie value outputs but when I access it from the page (also a subdomain of domain.com) I get an undefined index. According to the
[06:34:28] <jwuka> guys $(document).ready(function(){ ... } isn't working
[06:34:35] <JimmyXander> Hello all
[06:34:38] <JimmyXander> I have a questioni
[06:35:16] <remybach> jwuka: if that's what you're using, then you're missing ); at the end.
[06:35:57] <jwuka> remybach: this is my code: <script type='text/javascript'>                          $(document).ready(function() {                           alert('hello');                         });                           </script>
[06:36:17] <JimmyXander> lets say I have a button setup like this <button class="project" data-set="blue" data-number="5"></button>, now when I click on this button, i would like to append a list if images to the page using the data in the button. So the images would come from the blue folder and there will be 5 of them.
[06:36:24] <JimmyXander> How can I achieve this?
[06:37:43] <remybach> jwuka: are there any JS errors on the page?
[06:37:57] <remybach> … and are you sure you're including that script *after* including jQuery?
[06:38:20] <jwuka> yeah im getting "object" HTML document has no method 'ready'
[06:38:52] <mydog2> sammich,  - hey.. follow up..
[06:38:55] <jwuka> remybach: and viewing source code, the script is after the include
[06:38:55] <sahbeewah> JimmyXander, attempt to do it yourself and someone can tell you where you're going wrong
[06:39:27] <JimmyXander> I don't even know where to begin on this one
[06:39:32] <mydog2> sammich,  - i can create a test "foo" function that gets invoked from the success portion of the ajax function
[06:40:07] <JimmyXander> I can put together a click event but I don't know how to repeat a function. Or how to tell jquery I need 5 images based on a variable
[06:40:19] <mydog2> sammich,  - however, is there a way to "pass" different functions, so i can essentially call different functions as required
[06:40:31] <sammich> jwuka: do you have jQuery on the page, and is it loaded before that bit of code?
[06:40:55] <jwuka> yeah im using the google api jquery url
[06:40:57] <remybach> jwuka, what happens when you try:
[06:40:58] <remybach> jQuery(function($) {
[06:40:58] <remybach> 	/* code */
[06:40:58] <remybach> });
[06:41:48] <jwuka> yeah im using the google api jquery url
[06:41:56] <jwuka> remybach: it works
[06:42:20] <sammich> mydog2: of course. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[06:44:07] <sammich> depending on your scope of your function, you can do if (typeof window[targetFunc] === 'function') { targetFunc.apply([blah]); }
[06:44:18] <remybach> jwuka: There you go then :) No idea why your previous thing didn't work though.
[06:44:35] <sahbeewah> JimmyXander, you repeat a function by using a loop... you can retrieve data-* attributes using .data() or .attr()... you'll need to convert the string-value from the attribute by using parseInt()
[06:44:58] <sahbeewah> you might need to read some more
[06:48:46] <oste> anyone know how to remove a scrollbar from an element with overflow:auto property?
[06:49:27] <RandalSchwartz> how will you scroll?
[06:49:37] <RandalSchwartz> or ... don't make it overflow:auto :)
[06:50:06] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/1/ lets solve this one problem at a time. I want to generate a number of divs based on the data-num of the button. Here is what I have so far that isn't working.
[06:50:24] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/2/
[06:50:51] <oste> RAndalSchwartz jscrollpane
[06:51:36] <JimmyXander> nix that
[06:51:41] <JimmyXander> lets start simpler
[06:51:43] <JimmyXander> I'll be back
[06:51:59] <oste> I need to maintain overflow:auto so that the magic mice and other devices that allow horizontal scroll still work
[06:52:11] <oste> what a conundrum
[06:52:28] <sammich> overflow-y:hidden?
[06:53:12] <JimmyXander> okay lets do this. How to I get a my div to appear when I click the button. http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/6/
[06:54:07] <oste> no, i think i really need to keep things overflow:auto
[06:55:23] <seutje> JimmyXander: adding the actual library you're trying to use is a good start
[06:55:34] <JimmyXander> ha good point thnx
[06:55:45] <seutje> also, the div already appears onload, it's just empty
[06:56:23] <seutje> or do u mean the inner div? cause that seems to work, although the button suggests it would keep creating more, whereas right now it only overwrites the same one over and over
[06:57:05] <JimmyXander> okay
[06:57:16] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/12/
[06:57:18] <JimmyXander> now
[06:57:20] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/13/ now it keeps creating them
[06:57:28] <JimmyXander> why does the div not appear?
[06:57:52] <seutje> JimmyXander: u have a syntax error
[06:58:01] <seutje> '<div style="background:' + set ';"></div>'
[06:58:08] <seutje> needs a "+" after the set variable
[06:58:09] <sammich> JimmyXander: http://jsfiddle.net/84b5k/
[06:58:26] <JimmyXander> okay very good thank you
[06:58:28] <seutje> the console generally tells you about these simple issues btw
[06:59:10] <seutje> oh, it's suppose to make a number of boxes equal to the data attribute?
[06:59:25] <seutje> ma b
[06:59:35] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/84b5k/2/
[06:59:40] <sammich> that should be it
[06:59:42] <sammich> JimmyXander:
[07:00:00] <sammich> you had a stray double quote too early
[07:00:12] <seutje> kinda weird 0-indexed, no? :P
[07:00:25] <JimmyXander> okay great now I'm creating the box I want. Now in this example, I'm collecting the data-num variable. I want to use this to now create as many divs as is in this variable. http://jsfiddle.net/bEHHE/16/
[07:00:29] <seutje> also, usually a good idea to add the radix parameter to parseInt
[07:00:30] <JimmyXander> what am I doing wrong
[07:00:56] <sammich> seutje: I'll leave that to the implementer :)
[07:01:24] <seutje> JimmyXander: ur just grabbing the number and printing it once, it could have been a string for all the interpreter cares
[07:01:34] <seutje> JimmyXander: check out sammich's example
[07:01:47] <seutje> note how he calls parseInt() on the number he gets from the attribute
[07:01:50] <JimmyXander> oh
[07:01:52] <JimmyXander> wow
[07:01:53] <seutje> this turns it into a number instead of a string
[07:02:00] <JimmyXander> okay, how do I get it to start at 1?
[07:02:05] <sammich> add one ;)
[07:02:15] <seutje> then he uses that number to initiate a loop, append to a string and then put that string in the dom node
[07:02:55] <seutje> also note how he does not append the HTML inside the loop
[07:03:21] <JimmyXander> I kind of understand how this but works, but how do I get it to start at 1 instead of zero
[07:03:39] <sammich> lemme update it
[07:03:55] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/84b5k/3/
[07:04:23] <JimmyXander> I see
[07:04:24] <JimmyXander> very nice
[07:04:32] <JimmyXander> I owe you one sammich
[07:04:40] <seutje> u generally want to loop from 0 to length
[07:04:53] <seutje> otherwise u have to loop from 1 to (length+1) \
[07:05:03] <sammich> which is just hard to read
[07:05:08] <seutje> so it's better to do the manipulation on the actual user-facing stuff
[07:09:30] <mdunham918_> is there anyway to optimize this javascript code: http://jsfiddle.net/yGpn5/30/  mainly the li.on(click) function
[07:09:54] <mdunham918_> it seems like its as optimized has it can be but i just guessed
[07:11:45] <sammich> don't you just love CSS3?
[07:14:00] <NoiseEee> mdunham918_: my only advice would be being consistent with semi-colons. sometimes you use them, sometimes you don't.  hot-top: use them.
[07:14:16] <mdunham918_> i hate using them and normally don't
[07:14:21] <mdunham918_> i love clean JS
[07:14:25] <lord4163> Does anybody here have experience with valcum file uploader? http://valums-file-uploader.github.io/file-uploader/ Could someone tell me how I can send name aswell? :) http://pastie.org/private/4zffqkvrepxzgqdgncmrgw
[07:14:29] <seutje> sammich: I'd have its babies if I could
[07:14:45] <NiGhTTraX> is there any way to make jQuery UI sortable work with absolutely positioned elements? for instance, elements placed in a circular fashion
[07:14:50] <sammich> well I read that semi-colons speed up execution since the compiler doesn't have to guess where the line ends
[07:15:03] <NoiseEee> mdunham918_: either way, be consistent and be aware of the problems of not using one, also consider other people workin with your code
[07:15:20] <mdunham918_> NoiseEee: Yeah, I am normally this was a mashup
[07:15:29] <NoiseEee> mdunham918_: looks/works cool though :)
[07:15:35] <mdunham918_> been slaving over this all night
[07:15:45] <mdunham918_> couldn't believe i couldn't find anything like it anywhere
[07:16:05] <mdunham918_> i'll post the final product to some CSS site somewhere
[07:16:06] <seutje> mdunham918_: $('li').index(this) should probably be $(this).index()
[07:16:15] <mdunham918_> hmm
[07:16:21] <mdunham918_> i'll try that out
[07:16:22] <seutje> otherwise u might be grabbing LIs outside of your app
[07:16:50] <seutje> like if there's a block preceding the app with 1 li in it, all ur indexes will be off by 1
[07:17:14] <seutje> also, the prependTo('ul') seems extremely global
[07:17:26] <mdunham918_> worked like a charm thanks seutje
[07:17:39] <seutje> try to describe it as a way to get from $(this) to that specific UL
[07:17:40] <mdunham918_> yeah it will be more focused selector
[07:17:47] <seutje> probably $(this).closest('ul')
[07:17:50] <mdunham918_> this will be a plugin when I'm done
[07:18:07] <seutje> yeah, that's why u want to avoid querying the entire document all the time
[07:18:31] <mdunham918_> I'm going to store the ul in a local var within the plugin
[07:18:41] <mdunham918_> great optimization tip though
[07:18:45] <mdunham918_> easily missed
[07:18:59] <seutje> I usually have the plugin store whatever element it was called on, so I can easily query just the part I'm interested in
[07:19:03] <mdunham918_> so all looks well with the addClass and using css({})
[07:19:27] <seutje> not sure what that .height() call is suppose to do
[07:19:34] <seutje> $next.addClass('clicked').css({ left: pos.left + 'px', top: pos.top + 'px' }).prependTo('ul').height()
[07:19:37] <mdunham918_> its just supposed to trigger a reflow
[07:19:42] <seutje> oh
[07:19:53] <mdunham918_> without things get weird
[07:19:58] <seutje> is it necessary?
[07:20:00] <seutje> oh, funky
[07:20:30] <seutje> the removeAttr('style') might also be a bit risky
[07:20:47] <mdunham918_> wasn't sure how to remove my hardest top and left
[07:20:56] <seutje> if something else did something to it, ur app will blow it out of the water
[07:20:59] <mdunham918_> tried auto and inherit but that also overrides the css
[07:21:22] <seutje> yeah, things get annoying when u fiddle with inline styles and then want to remove them
[07:21:35] <sammich> you don't need the 'px', jQuery normalises that for you
[07:21:40] <seutje> I usually store an initial state and restore that when I "destroy"
[07:21:41] <sammich> unless, of course, it's all faster with it
[07:22:01] <seutje> but then I still run into problems what something else has added inline styles in between me storing the value and resetting it
[07:22:08] <seutje> s/what/when
[07:22:16] <mdunham918_> hmm might just move all the positioning math into JS also
[07:22:20] <mdunham918_> that would solve that issue
[07:22:39] <mdunham918_> as well as allow me the use of translate3d when available
[07:23:23] <mdunham918_> well you've convinced me seutje move the top left positioning to JS instead of precompiling the sin and cos
[07:24:23] <seutje> it's a fine line...
[07:24:33] <seutje> wtb calc()!
[07:24:37] <seutje> `caniuse calc
[07:24:38] <b-ot> seutje: You can use calc() as CSS unit value with: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 4, Chrome 19, Safari 6, and iOS Safari 6. http://caniuse.com/#search=calc
[07:25:19] <Krambiorix> hi guys, would it be possible to copy a file (Ctrl + C) and paste it in a DIV (Ctrl+P) ?
[07:26:48] <JimmyXander> how can I pull a string from a .txt with query?
[07:26:51] <JimmyXander> jquery*
[07:27:09] <JimmyXander> say I want to create an image and pull it's alt tag from a .txt file in the same directory
[07:28:47] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: $.get('alts.txt', function(text){ $('img').attr('alt', text); });
[07:29:29] <JimmyXander> okay wonderful, any way to pull a specific line from a .txt file? say line 2?
[07:30:18] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: You would do like... var lines = text.split("\n"); then use lines[1];
[07:30:46] <JimmyXander> I don't understand what you just said
[07:30:47] <JimmyXander> =(
[07:31:15] <JimmyXander> wait
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> Well, text is the content of the text file. text.split("\n") would break the files into pieces by a new line.
[07:31:25] <BillCriswell> \n == new line
[07:31:38] <JimmyXander> so text.splut creates an array?
[07:31:38] <BillCriswell> lines[1] would grab the second element in the array.
[07:31:44] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: Yes.
[07:31:49] <NiGhTTraX> is there any way to make jQuery UI sortable work with absolutely positioned elements? for instance, elements placed in a circular fashion
[07:31:49] <JimmyXander> okay
[07:32:14] <JimmyXander> and how do I put the second line of that array into it's own variable?
[07:32:34] <BillCriswell> var secondLine = lines[1];
[07:32:42] <JimmyXander> I see
[07:32:47] <BillCriswell> Anything further you should definitely Google. =)
[07:34:03] <JimmyXander> so like alts = $get('alts.txt').split('\n'),
[07:34:04] <JimmyXander>                     line = alts[2];?
[07:34:44] <JimmyXander> alts = $get('alts.txt').split('\n'),
[07:34:49] <JimmyXander> line = alts[2];
[07:34:54] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[07:35:06] <JimmyXander> okay what am I doing wrong?
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> I gave you all the pieces you need and pretty much put them where they should go.
[07:36:03] <JimmyXander> so maybe like this then
[07:36:21] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: Just try it and see.
[07:36:30] <JimmyXander> var alts = $get('alts.txt),
[07:36:43] <BillCriswell> Sending me code to run in my brain is a worthless step.
[07:36:44] <JimmyXander> text = alts.split('\n'),
[07:37:03] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: It doesn't work like that.
[07:37:04] <JimmyXander> line = text[2];
[07:37:09] <polymaths> use jsfiddle please
[07:37:15] <graphettion> ^
[07:37:23] <JimmyXander> how do I jsfiddle to pull from a local file?
[07:37:29] <NoiseEee> JimmyXander: are you confusing this channel as a place where someone writes code for you?
[07:37:36] <polymaths> demonstrate the concept
[07:37:45] <polymaths> in a jsfiddle, with json or whatever
[07:37:46] <NoiseEee> JimmyXander: are you familiar with javascript?
[07:38:15] <JimmyXander> Vaguely
[07:38:19] <JimmyXander> I'm a designer
[07:38:25] <FutureTense> I'm looking for an example on how to detect if a chrome extension with a specfic id is installed
[07:38:26] <JimmyXander> I'm just learning javascript
[07:38:39] <JimmyXander> actually jquery
[07:39:19] <JimmyXander> I'm not at the point yet where I can think of how to do things because I don't understand what can be done or how to do it
[07:39:55] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: Mix the first example code I said with the second.
[07:40:14] <BillCriswell> You can only work with alts.txt in the callback of $.get
[07:45:33] <JimmyXander> this is what I have. Of course it won't work because alts.xml is a local file on my machine…but the rest should still execute correct? So what am I doing wrong?
[07:45:34] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/3/
[07:46:35] <JimmyXander> I don't think I'm doing it right
[07:46:37] <shoky> JimmyXander: read back what BillCriswell has told you. most importantly the first thing he told you
[07:46:44] <shoky> JimmyXander: what you're doing wrong is you're not listening at all.
[07:47:23] <JimmyXander> I don't understand then
[07:47:27] <JimmyXander> I'm trying
[07:47:32] <shoky>  <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: $.get('alts.txt', function(text){ $('img').attr('alt', text); });
[07:47:47] <shoky> you see that function?  that's a callback. you can only work with the text inside there.
[07:47:52] <shoky> ?learn
[07:47:53] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:48:36] <JimmyXander> Okay so I think what you are saying is that I can't work with txt inside of variables? I have to create a function first?
[07:50:43] <JimmyXander> basically what I'm trying to achieve is similar to a lightbox. when a div is clicked. I want to take it's data-num="2" and append an image into the page with alt text. The alt text is located in a .txt file
[07:53:47] <JimmyXander> I don't understand, that line of code doesn't do what I want it to. That line of code ads the entire document to the alt tag of the image. I only want to add line 2. I'm very confused.
[07:55:32] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: text is the variable you'd use split() on.
[07:55:44] <BillCriswell> You can use any javascript you want in that function.
[07:56:15] <JimmyXander> but the image doesn't exist yet.
[07:56:21] <JimmyXander> it's being created by a click event
[07:56:56] <JimmyXander> when I click <DIV> I'm grabbing it's "data-num="2" then this tells the script which line of .txt to use as the alt
[07:57:21] <Krambiorix> does anyone know how to upload a file from the clipboard?
[07:58:48] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, any idea?
[07:59:06] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: can't do it
[07:59:39] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: It doesn't need to.
[07:59:42] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, i think it's possible
[07:59:55] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: is that like wishing hard enough?
[08:00:18] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, when i copy a file from my computer and i paste it in a textarea, i get the filepath
[08:00:35] <BillCriswell> You can create the image and append it in the callback.
[08:00:39] <Krambiorix> so maybe i can put that filepath in a file upload form and submit it... it would be possible
[08:01:46] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: nope, you don't get to choose what file you want the user to upload.  you can't fill in a 'file upload' control for obvious security reasons (ie: "give me /etc/passwd")
[08:01:48] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: It's not that easy.
[08:02:30] <Krambiorix> hmm
[08:03:42] <BillCriswell> ~/User/Photos/MyGirlfriendTopless.jpg is personally what I'd look for.
[08:05:22] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, how do you know?!
[08:05:49] <BillCriswell> Magic.
[08:25:52] <JimmyXander> Okay I'm back
[08:26:30] <JimmyXander> Here is a simplified example of what I am trying to accomplish. If  someone could walk me through what I am doing wrong and how I can do it right, that would be greatly appreciated. http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/6/
[08:28:39] <JimmyXander> anyone?
[08:31:21] <shoky> JimmyXander:  'div div' is not a good selector to be using.. use classes instead.  also, $('div div').click(...)  will add event handlers only to elements that are in the DOM at that time, not new elements
[08:31:42] <shoky> JimmyXander: also.. alts is not defined anywhere
[08:31:49] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, use .on(...) which is the new .live() :)
[08:33:31] <JimmyXander> okay I've done everything suggested except difine "alts" I don't know exactly how to do that bit. I have a commented line in there that I was told was incorrect. It stops the code from exeuting.
[08:33:41] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/9/
[08:34:16] <shoky> JimmyXander: this is how to fix those first 2 issues, using event delegation with .on  http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/7/
[08:34:55] <shoky> JimmyXander: alts.xml is an xml file or a text file with alts on each line..?
[08:35:19] <iig> Hi guys. I've got a question about using ajax requests other than GET/POST. Is it safe to do with jQuery?
[08:35:42] <JimmyXander> for this example it can be alts.txt
[08:35:52] <JimmyXander> so yes
[08:35:57] <JimmyXander> text file
[08:36:01] <JimmyXander> with alts on each line
[08:36:21] <iig> ... or I should set X-HTTP-Method-Override manually, in beforeSend callback?
[08:37:36] <shoky> JimmyXander: also you want .append not .appendTo
[08:37:56] <JimmyXander> I see.
[08:39:15] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: You can't do $('.projects div') till it exists, put that in the click event as well.
[08:39:21] <shoky> JimmyXander: maybe this will do.. http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/13/
[08:40:03] <shoky> JimmyXander: oops i meant http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/15/
[08:40:34] <JimmyXander> nothing happens
[08:40:43] <JimmyXander> when I click the blue boxes
[08:42:45] <sfdcNoob> hi
[08:43:35] <shoky> JimmyXander: you didn't put any data-set on the divs
[08:43:49] <shoky> JimmyXander: and you didn't close the quotes for the alt="..."
[08:44:48] <JimmyXander> one last question
[08:44:50] <shoky> JimmyXander: http://jsfiddle.net/5bY25/19/
[08:45:40] <JimmyXander> what if the document is in the directory of the set. So I click a blue box and it loads the /blue/alts.txt and I click a red box and it loads the red/alts.txt?
[08:45:44] <JimmyXander> is that possible?
[08:47:35] <shoky> yes. but you'll have to learn how to program for that, and javascript, and jquery
[08:48:29] <RandalSchwartz> learn... or hire
[08:51:17] <JimmyXander> I'm just trying to build a simple filterable portfolio with lightbox
[08:51:18] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/E7htp/2/
[08:51:25] <JimmyXander> this is my actual code
[08:51:31] <JimmyXander> for what I am trying to achieve
[08:52:20] <JimmyXander> I need to load the alt text/captions when the thumbnail is clicked
[08:54:34] <JimmyXander> thats it. Once I can get these captions to load into the fig caption box on command then I am golden
[08:54:52] <JimmyXander> I just can't seem to get that functionality working
[08:55:13] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: I would personally load alts.txt first then set up the code.
[08:55:30] <shoky> JimmyXander: hint: you have a problem in line 8
[08:55:38] <JimmyXander> right but there are 4 different alt.txt files
[08:55:43] <JimmyXander> one for each set
[08:57:29] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: You can wait for a bunch of them to load if you need to.
[08:58:11] <JimmyXander> you mean load all 4  and parse them into sets first?
[08:58:16] <JimmyXander> arrays*
[08:58:37] <JimmyXander> then how do I call the array I need based on the set that is chasen?
[08:58:40] <JimmyXander> chosen*
[08:59:41] <JimmyXander> I'm really not proficient enough to debug my own code from just looking at it.
[09:00:46] <shoky> JimmyXander: found the problem in line 8?
[09:01:18] <JimmyXander> nope
[09:01:22] <shoky> it's an html problem..
[09:01:39] <JimmyXander> hmm
[09:01:52] <shoky> go through each attribute you added there, check if its written validly
[09:01:58] <christophler_> Hello JQuery
[09:02:03] <shoky> anyone with half a brain is proficient enough
[09:02:08] <JimmyXander> I really don't see it
[09:02:14] <shoky> if you're too lazy that's something else.
[09:02:16] <shoky> then look harder
[09:02:49] * jugstah hands out chill pills
[09:03:17] <christophler_> is $().dequeue blocking on the function in the queue?  or does dequeue cause some existing thread of execution to continue?
[09:03:26] <JimmyXander> No closing quote on the data-num
[09:03:31] <JimmyXander> got it
[09:03:40] <christophler_> I really need a queue which can process functions within nesting function calls
[09:04:07] <christophler_> I can hear myself telling myself to readd the source code
[09:04:26] <JimmyXander> was that it? my only error?
[09:05:06] <shoky> JimmyXander: including jquery might also help
[09:06:00] <shoky> christophler_: not really sure what you were asking
[09:06:18] <JimmyXander> Okay I have the filter working perfectly
[09:06:27] <JimmyXander> how do I get the larger image to come up
[09:06:28] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/E7htp/6/
[09:06:53] <shoky> wait for the next sucker to help you for free
[09:06:59] <BillCriswell> lol
[09:07:29] <shoky> not even a hint of gratitude
[09:09:27] <BillCriswell> shoky: We're machines!
[09:09:29] <christophler_> shoky: so I want to queue up a bunch of functions, but it is quite likely the queues will go round in circles forever
[09:10:42] <christophler_> if I use jquery custom queue mechanism, do calls to .dequeue create a new function stack frame for the next function in the queue... if they do, then I will end up with infinitely deep stack frames, which will break
[09:11:17] <christophler_> the alternative is to process the queue with something on a timer, then I will only go one function stack frame deep...
[09:11:28] <christophler_> ye get me?
[09:12:05] <shoky> nope ;p
[09:12:05] <JimmyXander> I apologize if I came off as rude. I am extremely grateful for all your help. I tend to get a little overzealous when I'm so close.
[09:12:10] <christophler_> dequeue just calls fn.call(elem .....) which Im guessing means it just dumps into a stack frame
[09:12:16] <JimmyXander> Forgive me.
[09:12:25] <christophler_> Please forgive me, sir.
[09:12:34] <christophler_> sorry
[09:12:35] <christophler_> right
[09:13:04] <JimmyXander> If you ever need any help with HTML CSS or design I'd be more than happy to answer any of your questions to the best of my knowledge.
[09:14:05] <shoky> thanx
[09:14:15] <BillCriswell> NOW ANSWER HIS DAMN QUESTION
[09:14:23] <shoky> heehee
[09:14:30] <JimmyXander> I'll attempt to figure the rest out on my own.
[09:15:12] <JimmyXander> Thank you for your time.
[09:15:20] <jugstah> relax willis
[09:15:22] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: Then if that doesn't go well, come on back and we'll help. It's just annoying to see someone just right to the next question.
[09:15:39] <JimmyXander> I understand.
[09:16:04] <BillCriswell> Woooooooord.
[09:16:08] <jugstah> some people like to get their panties in a bunch on a Monday, don't sweat it.
[09:16:24] <BillCriswell> jugstah: Commando today bro.
[09:16:56] <BillCriswell> christophler_: I'm not following your question... self taught myself programming so a lot of the words you're using are throwing me off haha
[09:17:11] <BillCriswell> It sounds like you want an array of functions to loop through?
[09:19:44] <JimmyXander> I DID IT!!!!…WE DID IT!!!!! thanks
[09:19:58] <christophler_> so.. I have a queue of functions, however it is likely that the queue will be infinite, going round in circles
[09:20:39] * shoky dances with JimmyXander
[09:20:47] <christophler_> if I call $.dequeue manually, at the end of each function in the queue, then it looks to me that the jquery queueing mechanism will fall over, creating infinite stack frames
[09:22:05] <dcherman> christophler_: can you make a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do
[09:26:25] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[09:26:40] <RandalSchwartz> noisy autoaway is noisy
[09:41:06] <chris_> Can anyone recommend a simple library that can be used to allow users to add via a guid,  bold, italics and bullet points to textarea box ?
[09:41:40] <snover> no, because as far as i can tell, what you just said does not make sense
[09:41:55] <chris_> snover: you're correct
[09:42:25] <chris_> I need a simple html editor that will work with older browsers.
[09:42:36] <snover> how old
[09:42:51] <chris_> snover: IE6
[09:42:59] <snover> that’s dumb
[09:43:09] <chris_> snover: how so?
[09:43:58] <snover> because unless your primary target audience is China, nobody uses that browser
[09:44:08] <chris_> snover: One of the primary audiences is China
[09:44:28] <snover> well, what better way to force them to stop using it than to not support it then
[09:44:35] <snover> see, either way you lose with me
[09:44:47] <chris_> awesome
[09:48:35] <jugstah> add modernizr and then work your way backwards
[09:49:18] <mrboris> I'm having trouble with jquery mobile when trying to load the pages via the ajax method. http://m.powerfishn.com/ all of the pages exist, but it is returning a 500 error although I can see it returning the correct headers and html when called. Anyone have an idea?
[09:54:05] <samsoft> hello house
[09:54:18] <myosotis> hello chair
[09:54:31] <samsoft> please i need a script to bookmark and make a page as a homepage
[09:55:00] <jedimind> samsoft google.
[09:55:35] <jedimind> also, most people know how to bookmark these days without needing you to provide that functionality on your site
[09:56:06] <mrboris> I'm having trouble with jquery mobile when trying to load the pages via the ajax method. http://m.powerfishn.com/ all of the pages exist, but it is returning a 500 error although I can see it returning the correct headers and html when called. Anyone have an idea?
[09:56:27] <samsoft> ok
[09:57:04] <arschmitz> mrboris: a 500 error is a server error
[09:57:57] <jedimind> mrboris it looks like your server, for whatever reason, is returning 500 as a status code
[09:58:00] <jedimind> even though its loading the page
[09:58:05] <mrboris> right.
[09:58:18] <mrboris> you can access the page directly, but 500 when it tries to load via an xhr
[09:58:21] <jedimind> and jquery doesnt care that it got the data, because the 500 code it assumes its failed
[09:58:35] <jedimind> so… you need to fix whatever it is on your server thats returning the 500 code for whatever reason
[09:58:41] <jedimind> it still loads it when you ajax
[09:58:49] <jedimind> its just that your browser loads the page regardless of the 500 code
[09:58:53] <jedimind> and jquery doesnt
[09:59:13] <jedimind> i mean just loading m.powerfishn.com in my browser , i get a 500 error
[09:59:22] <guzzlefry> Does anyone know off the top of their heads, what the newest version of JQuery that still supports IE7 is?
[09:59:29] <jedimind> Request URL:http://m.powerfishn.com/ Request Method:GET Status Code:500 Internal Server Error
[09:59:41] <jedimind> guzzlefry 1.9.*
[09:59:45] <jedimind> guzzlefry anything less than 2.0
[09:59:51] <guzzlefry> oh awesome
[10:00:01] <guzzlefry> I was expecting something much older. :P
[10:00:10] <mrboris> ya, i'm seeing that jedimind. not exactly sure how to debug the 500 error.
[10:00:20] <arschmitz> guzzlefry: the difference between 1.9.x and 2.x is old ie support
[10:00:33] <jedimind> mrboris its your server, contact your server admin? or look into your apache logs
[10:00:35] <NoiseEee> mrboris: via the server.
[10:00:42] <mrboris> k
[10:08:33] <Phoenixz> I have a JQM based project, it works on most mobile phones, but now on a HTC1, for some reason, when clicking an input type=text, the keyboard does not show, and on nexus 4, when I see a page with a long list, the scroll won't work, but reloading the page, makes scroll work again.. Any of these issues ring a bell somewhere?
[10:09:47] <Crabnab> Greetings all.
[10:10:01] <arschmitz> Phoenixz: the fact the reloading makes it work sounds like you have a custom script that you are executing on document ready
[10:10:46] <Crabnab> I'm trying to make a field validation that is 10 numbers with leading 0s- http://jsfiddle.net/Vkxus/ -- can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[10:16:23] <Phoenixz> arschmitz: yes, we do lots of stuff on document ready, but the issue is that it works on every mobile imaginable, but not on nexus 4 for some reason
[10:17:16] <arschmitz> things you execute on document ready will never fire execpt on inital page load
[10:17:26] <arschmitz> in jquery mobile
[10:18:16] <arschmitz> Phoenixz: if you can make a reproducible test case on the nexus 4 in a jsbin the team will be more then happy to take a look at it for you
[10:19:04] <arschmitz> Phoenixz: just file it as a bug report on github.
[10:22:51] <Phoenixz> At this point only asking if maybe it rings a bell somewhere :)  Maybe it is me, really not sure at this point
[10:22:59] <Phoenixz> Could it be related to fixed header / footers?
[10:25:20] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: You have a few things mixed up.
[10:27:34] <BillCriswell> "this" is automatically the element in function pad()
[10:27:53] <BillCriswell> So I think you're changing this into the event object
[10:28:23] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: http://jsfiddle.net/Vkxus/2/ I came up with this.
[10:29:29] <Crabnab> Wow- there's a lot of shorthand I don't understand in that fiddle.
[10:30:46] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: e should probably be event, for clarification
[10:30:53] <BillCriswell> force of habit, sorry about that
[10:31:09] <Crabnab> I mean- that code is sexy, I just don't know what it means, lol
[10:31:51] <BillCriswell> Array( N ) would return an empty array with that many empty elements. I then join them with what I want to repeat.
[10:33:04] <BillCriswell> Since I don't know if there's a javascript str_repeat type dealie
[10:33:18] <Crabnab> So you're taking the .data element of e which is the event (blur) and the data element of to is 10, so its 10 - (minus) the length of this minus 1. Then you add that many 0s to the array then join them, yes?
[10:33:39] <Crabnab> God that's terrible english.
[10:33:50] <Crabnab> I just hit you with some stream of consciousness.
[10:33:52] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: It was close enough. Yeah, that sounds right.
[10:35:36] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: BAsically, you don't have to pass "this" to pad, this is automatically there. The first argument is the "event", so I think you were turning "this" into the event.
[10:35:48] <Crabnab> ahh
[10:42:17] <Crabnab> BillCriswell: thank you- big help!
[10:42:30] <BillCriswell> Crabnab: Glad I could help!
[10:56:16] <aeiou42> I have a droppable on a table, Is there a way to see which row of the table had the item dropped on it?
[10:59:53] <BillCriswell> aeiou42: I'm not too familiar with it.. but if you can get the cell the thingie was dropped on you could just do $target.closest('tr')
[11:01:14] <jtbandes> is there a way to get an ajax response body as JSON in the error case? (e.g. 500)
[11:02:01] <BillCriswell> jtbandes: Hmmm...
[11:02:09] <BillCriswell> There is $.parseJSON
[11:02:13] <aeiou42> Thanks, I'll try that
[11:02:27] <BillCriswell> Think that's the best it can do?
[11:03:01] <BillCriswell> jtbandes: Does the error send application/json headers?
[11:03:05] <jtbandes> BillCriswell: hm, I guess that'll do
[11:03:58] <jtbandes> BillCriswell: I'm not sure, but I am telling jquery "dataType":"json"
[11:14:06] <dwarder> if i want to load an ajax upon page load i just put this request in $(function() {} , right?
[11:15:02] <shoky> dwarder that should work, ya
[11:15:10] <dwarder> thank you
[11:34:32] <thansen> I'm using a data-reveal style search on a listview (mobile), I'd like to interact with the search input box programattically but I can seem to find an id on it or anyway to get the element..anyone have some tips?
[11:38:29] <Bloomberg> afternoon guys!!
[11:38:34] <aeiou42> Well $target.closest didn't work, it just returned the first row, However I was able to make it work by making each row droppable and then using  $(event.target).parent().children().index($(event.target));
[11:39:17] <Bloomberg> I need to set the success messagge when I delete a record in the table of Jtable Jquery plugin!!
[11:39:32] <Bloomberg> But I don't know how can i get it!!
[11:44:54] <bakers> ajpiano: Just checking to make sure you were here!
[11:45:09] <bakers> ajpiano: Great talk last week... I'm still laught about zepto-jpeg
[11:46:38] <fran_23> $.getJSON('controller.php?rep=1', function(data){})   is a get ajax request?
[11:47:00] <dwarder> what do you use for ajax file upload?
[11:47:23] <dwarder> what should i use
[11:47:34] <rfish2> is there a way for jquery validation to have the validator pick a class with it?
[11:47:58] <bakers> fran_23: I would sure think so, what else would it be?
[11:54:08] <fran_23> bakers:  im trying to display a chart once i submit a form so i was wondering how can i send the json data in my ajax request
[11:54:44] <bakers> fran_23: You can send data with the data parameter of getJSON
[11:54:54] <bakers> otherwise just do a $.ajax() request yourself
[12:03:42] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/ysAY5/
[12:03:52] <fran_23> bakers: this is what im doing http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/1/ but for some reason im not able to echo rep in php when i submit the form
[12:03:59] <Bloomberg> someone could tell me why I cannot acces to value with this script?
[12:05:51] <shoky> Bloomberg: what?  you can
[12:06:17] <JosephSilber> Bloomberg: I'm the last b
[12:06:18] <BillCriswell> Having a linter in my text editor has me reaching levels of picky I didn't want to know exist.
[12:06:30] <JosephSilber> Bloomberg: http://jsfiddle.net/ysAY5/1/
[12:08:17] <dorgan> when using .ajax() and getting back a 400 error, i do not seem to be hitting my fail() or error() handlers for that call, is there something else I have to use?
[12:11:48] <BillCriswell> dorgan: Is it retuning a 404 http header?
[12:11:57] <psynor> dumb question, what happens if I use something like slidedown on a hidden element?  Will it remain hidden?
[12:12:49] <dorgan> BillCriswell: no 400, which is what I expect as its a unit test that is supposed to fail
[12:12:59] <dorgan> well not fail, but get a 400 error
[12:13:14] <BillCriswell> dorgan: I meant to ask 400, sorry about that.
[12:13:30] <BillCriswell> dorgan: That's weird. If you're sending a 400 status code I'd imagine the error or fail would fire
[12:13:52] <Bloomberg> JosephSilber: yes that right, but the problem is that the default value is empty, but if I onclick a list automatically add the value to last b tag
[12:14:14] <JosephSilber> Bloomberg: ...and?
[12:14:25] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/GPsJj/
[12:14:35] <Bloomberg> I need to it with this
[12:14:40] <Bloomberg> do it*
[12:15:03] <lejocelyn> jquery ui autocomplete should be working with Chrome, no ?
[12:15:09] <dorgan> BillCriswell: yeah so would I....lol
[12:15:56] <BillCriswell> dorgan: Most of the time this situation occurs when it's a "404" but with a 200 status code.
[12:16:04] <BillCriswell> Is it live anywhere?
[12:16:07] <Bloomberg> JosephSilber: Understand what I wanna to do?
[12:16:45] <JosephSilber> Bloomberg: Nope. Can you create a http://sscce.org/ ?
[12:17:11] <shoky> lejocelyn: of course
[12:17:51] <Bloomberg> why?
[12:18:56] <jugstah> I love using jQuery to make a specific someone's life miserable just for fun.
[12:19:01] <Trudko_> Guys any good article about benefits of cahing selectors? Cant find real app comparison
[12:20:20] <lejocelyn> shoky: strange bug I have then. My code works with Firefox but not with Chrome and I don't know what to look for
[12:20:27] <Bloomberg> Is simple, In my page I have like an index of "where I'm now". so if you enter to home doesn't show nothing. but if  you enter to menu item autmatically in the last b tag will show the name of menu in where you are now
[12:20:33] <Bloomberg> is dinamic
[12:20:48] <shoky> lejocelyn: that's what jsfiddle is for
[12:20:58] <RandalSchwartz> or jsbin
[12:21:42] <jugstah> console.log is your friend.
[12:24:15] <lejocelyn> shoky: but Chrome just tell me that there is an error in jquery.min.js
[12:24:37] <lejocelyn> whether I use it from local or Google, and I didn't touch it
[12:27:39] <lejocelyn> shoky: http://postimg.org/image/86de0r7b5/ it's weird no?
[12:28:15] <shoky> lejocelyn: that doesnt say anything to me without seeing what you're doing
[12:28:24] <grafi> yup
[12:29:05] <shoky> lejocelyn: my guess is something is happening with your server's response to the autocomplete ajax
[12:29:44] <lejocelyn> http://jsfiddle.net/n85H9/
[12:29:46] <harshamv> $(".pageSection:in-viewport:nth-child(2)").attr('id')  doesnt work..
[12:29:55] <harshamv> how to select the second element ?
[12:30:06] <lejocelyn> shoky: why would it work with Firefox but not with Chrome ?
[12:30:40] <lejocelyn> shoky: ah ok
[12:31:26] <shoky> lejocelyn: what?
[12:31:29] <BillCriswell> harshamv: :eq(2) ?
[12:31:45] <lejocelyn> might have to do with the headers then
[12:32:04] <dorgan> Anyone have any other ideas on an ajax() josn request returning a 400 error but fail() not being called?
[12:32:10] <shoky> lejocelyn:  function initCompletion(selector, source, minLength = 1, delay = 50)
[12:32:18] <shoky> lejocelyn:  i think you're mistaking javascript for something else
[12:32:21] <harshamv> BillCriswell: thanks i will try that :D
[12:32:27] <shoky> lejocelyn: there's your unexpected =
[12:33:33] <lejocelyn> ahhh
[12:33:35] <lejocelyn> ok
[12:33:53] <lejocelyn> I though it was because the http header of the generated json wasn't correct
[12:34:26] <shoky> maybe that too :P but first fix the js
[12:36:15] <lejocelyn> shoky: yes, I thought I could have default values
[12:36:37] <lejocelyn> but no : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/894860/set-a-default-parameter-value-for-a-javascript-function
[12:37:25] <lejocelyn> shoky: strange that it works with Firefox then
[12:37:36] <lejocelyn> and the default values are recognized
[12:38:17] <shoky> lejocelyn:  heh https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/default_parameters
[12:38:22] <shoky> look at the table at the bottom
[12:38:57] <BillCriswell> Wonder why they even bother supporting it?
[12:39:18] <shoky> it says "part of the draft ECMAScript 6 specification"
[12:39:22] <lejocelyn> so I guess a ternary is the option
[12:39:27] <lejocelyn> minLength = typeof a !== 'undefined' ? a : 1;
[12:40:14] <BillCriswell> oh, it'll be new to javascript
[12:40:37] <BillCriswell> I like the idea for sure
[12:41:29] <shoky> yep why not
[12:42:06] <lejocelyn> not mine thou http://stackoverflow.com/questions/894860/set-a-default-parameter-value-for-a-javascript-function
[12:42:33] <shoky> why tf does firefox have this stupid message when opening it :\  Security and privacy are not optional. Stand with a broad coalition to demand that the NSA stop watching us: stopwatching.us
[12:43:21] <BillCriswell> Prism I guess.
[12:43:46] <shoky> sorry.. but.. stupid americans :\
[12:43:59] <shoky> oh noes the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing
[12:45:14] <BillCriswell> I can't agree with that.
[12:45:54] <shoky> as if it wasn't obvious it was happening, before this leak..
[12:47:12] <shoky> ill shutup now
[12:47:23] <shoky> ff's fault
[12:48:25] <grafi> nsa is there for domestic surveillance?
[12:50:34] <shoky> if it involves NS
[12:51:31] <toddWork_> forgot how to do this: i want to capture clicks by grabbing all clicks in an outer div, then ask if the thing that was actually clicked hasClass=foo then do something. how do i grab that inner clicked target?
[12:52:02] <BillCriswell> toddWork_: You can use $('.parent').on('click', '.foo', function(){ ... });
[12:52:03] <EugenA> I have <tr> and some <td>s. If I click on any TD I'd like to get the value of specific TD in the same row
[12:52:45] <EugenA> the TDs and TRs doesn't have any IDs
[12:53:00] <BillCriswell> EugenA: So you need to get it by index?
[12:53:10] <toddWork_> BillCriswell: but what if i want to do $('.parent').on('click', function() {  --- a long list of if else hasClass to get all the child clicks ---- })?
[12:53:14] <BillCriswell> $td.nextAll().eq(3) should work.
[12:53:25] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Do you know if is there like layouts levels to put some value in a tag?
[12:53:34] <EugenA> BillCriswell: thanks, will try it
[12:53:39] <BillCriswell> toddWork_: You'd do function(e){ var $target = $(e.target); })
[12:53:47] <toddWork_> ah, e.target. yes. thanks BillCriswell
[12:53:55] <BillCriswell> toddWork_: Then do if ( $target.is('.foo')) etc
[12:54:24] <toddWork_> nice
[12:54:27] <toddWork_> i like it.
[12:55:35] <BillCriswell> EugenA: .prevAll(2) could work.. might be easiest to do like $td.closest('tr').find('td').eq(2) so you have a solid starting point.
[12:55:44] <harshamv> BillCriswell: :eq(2) doesnt seem to work ... :first and :last works
[12:56:08] <BillCriswell> harshamv: eq(2) dedinitely works, might not be doing what you want through.
[12:56:10] <BillCriswell> though*
[12:56:14] <BillCriswell> harshamv: Have a demo somewhere?
[12:57:47] <harshamv> one sec uploading
[12:59:27] <harshamv> BillCriswell: http://sophiance.com/v2/
[12:59:35] <harshamv> i am loggin it into the console.
[13:01:41] <BillCriswell> harshamv: .live is deprecated
[13:02:14] <harshamv> BillCriswell: yeah thats from the plugin i am using. but this is not related to that
[13:02:29] <harshamv> just scroll the page u will see it in action
[13:06:51] <BillCriswell> harshamv: Not sure what in-viewport does, but .pageSection:eq(2)
[13:06:54] <BillCriswell> does work.
[13:07:32] <BillCriswell> try $(".pageSection:in-viewport:first").next() and see wht happens.
[13:08:27] <harshamv> BillCriswell: i am trying .next() but in between the 2nd and 3rd there is another div so its captureing that
[13:08:44] <harshamv> any way .next() can capture only the next element of a certain id
[13:08:49] <harshamv> or class
[13:09:43] <BillCriswell> do .nextAll('.pageSection').eq(0)
[13:10:56] <harshamv> BillCriswell: thanks that works :D
[13:11:11] <EugenA> BillCriswell: will $td.closest('tr') find the parent TR or next TR?
[13:11:12] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[13:11:22] <BillCriswell> EugenA: parent.
[13:11:45] <harshamv> BillCriswell: thanks a lot :D Appreciate it
[13:11:50] <BillCriswell> EugenA: .parent('tr') would also work, just  a habit using .closest() since I'm rarely dealing with the first parent.
[13:11:55] <BillCriswell> harshamv: No problem at all!
[13:12:03] <BillCriswell> EugenA: Err, just .parent() actually.
[13:12:07] <BillCriswell> No reason for the selector.
[13:12:20] <ramvi> I'm having problems with $.ajax jquery v2.0.1. If i do it with data: { data: 'test' } I see "test" on the server. but if I do an array or object like data: { data: ['test'] } There is nothing in post["data"] when it arrives on the server
[13:12:22] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to use ajax to get a file stream and then store it in localstorage to cache it?
[13:12:50] <maxmoore14> I have a service that streams a requested file as a application/octet-stream
[13:12:58] <BillCriswell> ramvi: You product need { 'data[]': ['test'] }
[13:13:06] <BillCriswell> s/product/probably
[13:13:33] <maxmoore14> would like to call the service with $.ajax() and grab the response and stick it in localstorage so it doesn't have to be re-downloaded
[13:13:35] <ramvi> BillCriswell: Thanks for answering. Why? data is the key and the value is an array
[13:14:02] <maxmoore14> I've found info on different parts of it, like base64 encoding, but I can't seem to put it all together
[13:14:23] <maxmoore14> should I be using FileReader or is that just for local files?
[13:15:19] <ramvi> BillCriswell: It's no go. Still no data on the server with  { 'data[]': ['test'] }
[13:17:14] <BillCriswell> What do you get when you just print_r($_POST) ?
[13:19:47] <mydog2> hmm.. shouldn't this work... $('[name=ppp]').val("aaa")  << shouldn't this set the value of the textbox to "aaa" <<
[13:20:08] <eddiemonge> maxmoore14: what kind of file? why are you saving it to localstorage instead of having the user download it?
[13:20:29] <mydog2> assuming i have an input/text with the name=ppp
[13:20:44] <eddiemonge> mydog2: yeah. try '[name="ppp"]'
[13:21:33] <ramvi> BillCriswell:  self.request.str_POST returns MultiDict([('data[]', '1'), ('data[]', '2'), ('data[]', '3')])
[13:21:35] <maxmoore14> eddiemonge: it could be any type of file, though usually photos/videos. the download would be triggered by the user. I just want to create a cache so that the user doesn't incur the download cost twice
[13:21:44] <ramvi> for data: [1, 2, 3]
[13:22:06] <ramvi> that's not true. for {data: '1', '2', '3'}
[13:22:52] <maxmoore14> eddiemonge: it is not a simple download as attachment. I need to be able to manipulate the files within my app. So I can display in an <img> tag for example.
[13:23:05] <mydog2> eddiemonge,  - hmm.. nope..
[13:23:21] <eddiemonge> maxmoore14: whats wrong with the normal browser cache?
[13:23:27] <eddiemonge> mydog2: example code?
[13:24:41] <maxmoore14> eddiemonge: I need greater control of the set of files. For one thing, I want to be able to switch between sessionStorage and localStorage depending on settings. Also need to be able to clear the cache on command
[13:25:01] <ramvi> BillCriswell: and it's MultiDict([('data[]', '1'), ('data[]', '2'), ('data[]', '3')]) no matter what I set dataType to
[13:27:09] <fran_23> how can i get json data via get and post data in the same ajax call?
[13:27:55] <BillCriswell> I'm guessing that's like.. pyhon? Not familiar with how that interacts with HTML forms.
[13:29:23] <BillCriswell> I know with PHP if I do print_r($_POST) with data: { foo: ['bar', 'baz'] } it looks as I expect it to.
[13:29:48] <eddiemonge> fran_23: get the data or send the data?
[13:30:08] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  both
[13:30:34] <eddiemonge> huh?
[13:30:47] <jedimind> both get and send
[13:32:47] <eddiemonge> fran_23: can you explain further? what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:33:49] <ramvi> BillCriswell: ok, thanks, i got it. for some reason query turns the key "data" into "data[]", so doing a get_all() for that key, I get what I expected
[13:33:55] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  guess im doing it wrong but i think i can do all this in just one ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/2/
[13:34:18] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  in searchProjectsRep()
[13:35:19] <ASPIRANT> Is it not possible to cascade calls to $.getScript?  (i.e. call getScript within a script that is loaded by getScript)
[13:36:05] <eddiemonge> fran_23: oh. why not return it all in one response? like say a json response?
[13:36:17] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  right
[13:36:20] <eddiemonge> ASPIRANT: that is not ideal for performance
[13:37:00] <fran_23> eddiemonge: the problem is that i need the json response once i submit the form.. thats why im doing a post request
[13:37:12] <ASPIRANT> I'm just doing some quick prototyping and it would help keep dependencies straight
[13:37:44] <ASPIRANT> The problem I'm having is I can call getscript from scripts referenced in the HTML just fine, but the scripts just don't load if called from another loaded script
[13:38:48] <eddiemonge> fran_23: yeah, you post the data and the server can respond with the json and html at the same time in the same response http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/3/
[13:39:11] <eddiemonge> ASPIRANT: why dont you use requireJS or some other script loader to do this?
[13:39:24] <ASPIRANT> wasn't aware that such existed
[13:39:35] <ASPIRANT> will look into it thanks
[13:39:59] <ASPIRANT> But anyway, should I think theory be able to do that?
[13:40:29] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  ill try that
[13:49:24] <fran_23> eddiemonge:  html.json looks for the json inside the html?
[13:52:42] <wahed> hi, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3319641c251639a0a5a6 , the alert(clickedPinId) show me undefined
[13:52:50] <wahed> can someone tell me why?
[13:53:27] <wahed> I think instead of $(this) in  $(this).data('pinid'); I have to write something else?!
[13:53:56] <abes> Question: can I create a selector for find('a') that will find all anchor elements, but skip the ones which have a css attribute of cursor equal to default? So something like find('a:not[cursor=default]'). Your help is greatly appreciated!
[13:54:47] <BillCriswell> abes: You answered yourself.
[13:55:01] <BillCriswell> abes: Almost, sorry.
[13:55:08] <BillCriswell> a:not([custom=default])
[13:55:14] <BillCriswell> GRR
[13:55:26] <BillCriswell> a:not([cursor=default])
[13:55:50] <shoky> wahed: https://gist.github.com/antishok/a91770b04fe43d36f27e
[13:55:55] <sunbeam> if a li a has class .something I want to give the parent of that a (the li) the class .cool
[13:55:59] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[13:56:29] <BillCriswell> $('.something').parent().addClass('cool')
[13:56:39] <shoky> abes: BillCriswell: that won't look for css cursor ;P
[13:57:00] <abes> shoky: yes, yes I realize that...
[13:57:42] <shoky> abes: you can use .filter(function(){ return $(this).css('cursor')==='default' })  i guess
[13:57:46] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha, I assumed there was a strange attribute on there.
[13:57:56] <BillCriswell> Oh wow he asked that.
[13:58:02] <BillCriswell> Dude I read like half then zoned out.
[13:58:09] <shoky> lol
[13:58:42] <wahed> thank you shoky
[13:59:40] <BillCriswell> I think cursor may default to "auto"?
[14:00:11] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: thanks
[14:01:12] <lejocelyn> hi, with jquery ui tab, how is it possible to reload a tab?
[14:01:14] <shoky> BillCriswell sounds likely ;p
[14:02:02] <lejocelyn> I've got a php page that I load dynamically witgh jquery ui, a form actually, can I reload the page to display new information ?
[14:02:13] <lejocelyn> I don't see how to with the online api
[14:03:00] <abes> shoky: thanks - I used the filter (although with != rather than ===) and it worked :D
[14:04:50] <lejocelyn> sorry, I didn't look well enough on the web

[14:36:45] <maxmoore14> anyone have experience with Blob and FileReader? I'm really struggling here!
[14:46:28] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[14:46:32] <Bloomberg> I have a problem!!
[14:46:33] <wc-> hi all, i see about 50 different form validation plugins out there, any opinions on the go-to solution?
[14:54:45] <innociv> How do I manually show/hide a tooltip, instead of it triggering by mouseover?
[14:58:53] <Eviltwin> innociv: By using artificial tooltips http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[14:59:10] <innociv> Yeah I'm using those
[14:59:21] <innociv> But how do I trigger one to show wihtout a hover?
[14:59:22] <Eviltwin> Have you tried triggering show?
[15:00:02] <Bloomberg> I have a list of items for a menu
[15:00:29] <innociv> .tooltip( "open" ) says "Error: cannot call methods on tooltip prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'"
[15:00:41] <Bloomberg> I have the problem that if I onclick the list of menu and I do an alert where I can show the name of menu, show one later
[15:01:02] <Bloomberg> so, is like delayed
[15:01:06] <Bloomberg> why?
[15:01:41] <Eviltwin> innociv: Then you called it before you initialized it
[15:01:54] <innociv> Well I have tooltip bound on body
[15:02:00] <innociv> So it affects everything with a title
[15:04:12] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: can you explain that again? or have an example?
[15:06:33] <savid> How do I trigger an event while attaching extra eventData to the event object?
[15:07:00] <Eviltwin> innociv: I would do $(elementYouWantToShowTheTooltipOf).tooltip().tooltip("open") and then .tooltip("destroy") on that element when you're done showing it
[15:08:14] <innociv> eh I got it. It sucks that I have to bind tooltip to the elemnt itself and not just body
[15:09:12] <Eviltwin> innociv: You could try triggering the mouseover event on the element
[15:09:17] <Eviltwin> I don't know if that's better or worse
[15:09:55] <innociv> Oh yeah
[15:34:15] <`e> hi

[16:08:43] <tw2113> how can i shoky
[16:11:51] <dpyle> Hey, could someone take a sec and confirm if this is a jquery-ui bug or I'm just crazy? Reduced test case @ http://jsfiddle.net/VNZW8/ - try dragging things from the sidebar into the main content area
[16:14:18] <zorbash> dpyle seems to work for me
[16:15:12] <dpyle> zorbash: thanks for taking a look :). I'm seeing placeholders for things being dragged in appearing *above* the main content list unless i do a little mouse dance to reshuffle them.
[16:16:01] <dpyle> few ppl around the office have verified this one, so it's definitely occuring in newest chrome - I'll do a bit more testing.
[16:19:53] <wc-> anyone used h5validator?
[16:39:08] <mitchdotpro> Can anyone tell me if there is a jQuery plugin that can help make an interface like this? http://goo.gl/xDz3Y
[16:39:27] <mitchdotpro> Need something that gives a range slider type of interface with lock points along the way that it snaps to.
[16:39:57] <dpyle> mitchdotpro: http://jqueryui.com/slider/ with a 'step' attribute will get you close. the styling you'll have to do yourself
[16:42:30] <mitchdotpro> dpyle: Cheers, thanks for that! :D
[16:43:32] <utroda> I have a form that when submitted i index the select to the next option, but when it reaches the end its index is -1 not 0, how would i go about setting it to 0, I tried this, http://jsfiddle.net/T7V3r/ but with no luck.
[16:50:44] <eddiemonge> utroda: what are you trying to do?
[16:51:00] <utroda> eddiemonge: I just got it with this "$("#weekday option:selected").prop("selected", false).next().prop("selected", true);"
[16:51:06] <chovy> how do i convert $("<div/>") to an html string?
[16:51:45] <utroda> eddiemonge: it was selecting the correct option, but outputting nothing and the idx was -1 instead of 0
[16:54:20] <systemfault> chovy: On most browsers, you can use $("<div/>")[0].outerHtml IIRC
[16:54:34] <systemfault> Err
[16:54:37] <systemfault> outerHTML
[16:54:49] <andres_23> eddiemonge: you helped me before with this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/3/.. i was wondering if html.json is the json inside the html ?
[16:56:12] <chovy> systemfault: thanks
[16:56:47] <chovy> how would i select $("li") up to the 3rd one? In other words I want 1,2,3 but not 4,5
[16:57:48] <systemfault> $("li:lt(3)") IIRC
[16:59:34] <eddiemonge> andres_23: that was supposed to be resp.json
[16:59:55] <eddiemonge> lt @ chovy
[17:00:05] <eddiemonge> ? lt @ chovy
[17:00:06] <bot-t> chovy, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[17:01:23] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  doesnt matter if i have more html other than the json?
[17:04:12] <eddiemonge> andres_23: put it all in a json response from the server
[17:05:41] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  how would i do that..
[17:05:53] <eddiemonge> andres_23: what backend are you using?
[17:06:11] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  php
[17:07:09] <eddiemonge> echo json_encode(array("html"=>$html, "chartdata"=>$chartdata);
[17:07:32] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/5/
[17:07:34] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  thats exactly what im doing
[17:08:22] <eddiemonge> whats the problem then?
[17:10:03] <andres_23> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/6/
[17:11:48] <eddiemonge> andres_23: what is that supposed to be?
[17:12:12] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  the backend
[17:13:26] <eddiemonge> i dont know what im supposed to do with that. what part is missing?
[17:15:26] <andres_23> eddiemonge: the problem is that im not able to see the output in the browser.. only the response in the console
[17:16:18] <eddiemonge> andres_23: well if thats your backend and front end, then no you wouldnt be able to because your response is not structured the same as your js is expecting
[17:16:30] <eddiemonge> unless $serv is an array with html and chartdata as keys
[17:18:02] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  thats right.. thats why i was confused.. im wondering how to structure both the html and the json
[17:18:27] <eddiemonge> i told you already
[17:18:29] <eddiemonge> echo json_encode(array("html"=>$html, "chartdata"=>$chartdata);
[17:18:47] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  $serv is only an array with data from the server
[17:19:05] <eddiemonge> you have to add the other chart data as well
[17:19:44] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  chartdata would be $serv in this case?
[17:21:28] <eddiemonge> what is it you are trying to do exactly?
[17:22:46] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  need to display some info + chart after i submit the form (look for a particular project)
[17:26:35] <eddiemonge> andres_23: basically it is this: http://jsfiddle.net/f8rGb/7/  if you can't get it from there, you might need to relearn (or learn) the basics for php and or javascript
[17:27:57] <andres_23> eddiemonge:  thanks
[18:17:20] <RandalSchwartz> so some of the callbacks changed in ui between 1.7 and 1.10
[18:17:24] <RandalSchwartz> seems to have broken my code
[18:19:41] <Patricia_> ui 1.7 and 1.10 or core?  if it's the jquery core, you can use the migrate plugin: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-migrate-plugin
[18:21:48] <RandalSchwartz> no ui
[18:22:02] <RandalSchwartz> looks like all the events got changed
[18:22:19] <RandalSchwartz> also, I need to hook in on create... looks like I have to figure out how to override or extend _create
[18:22:30] <RandalSchwartz> instead of _init like before
[18:22:55] <Patricia_> ahh, they talked aout updating the ui at the keynotes at the conference in portland last week.  trying to make them consistent
[18:23:36] <Patricia_> which widget?
[18:23:47] <RandalSchwartz> tabs
[18:24:09] <RandalSchwartz> I wrote an extension to make it so that <a href="#tabs-3">...</a> in any other tab content would actually just make the tab switch
[18:24:12] <RandalSchwartz> it's very slick
[18:24:20] <RandalSchwartz> but totally broken when I went from 1.7 to 1.10
[18:26:54] <Patricia_> that is slick...
[18:27:30] <RandalSchwartz> in fact, on hover, it even highlighted the tab
[18:27:35] <Patricia_> shouldn't be to hard to re-make, you would want to set the active tab on the even click right?
[18:28:25] <RandalSchwartz> you can see it in use at http://insightcruises.com/itinerary_g/sa16_itinerary.html
[18:28:30] <RandalSchwartz> hover over the links in the table
[18:28:37] <RandalSchwartz> you'll see the tabs highlight
[18:28:50] <RandalSchwartz> and if you click on them, it just re-tabs
[18:29:17] <RandalSchwartz> that worked with 1.7, but not 1.10
[18:29:28] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - just need to work out the hooks
[18:30:12] <RandalSchwartz> previously overrode _init to do the hooking, and the 'tabsshow' event to add the events
[18:30:20] <RandalSchwartz> but both of those changed between 1.7 and 1.10
[18:31:36] <RandalSchwartz> I think it's now _create and ... hmm.  "beforeActivate"?
[18:31:48] <taybin__> is there a way to get query to warn that I'm passing incorrect html to .html() ?
[18:32:02] <taybin__> s/query/jQuery
[18:33:27] <Patricia_> are your tabs ajaxly loaded?
[18:33:36] <RandalSchwartz> no
[18:33:42] <RandalSchwartz> all static
[18:34:02] <taybin__> I'm sure I have an extra </div> somewhere and it is killing IE8 :(
[18:34:14] <RandalSchwartz> IE8 deserves death
[18:34:59] <taybin__> I agree, but it's not my call
[18:35:12] * RandalSchwartz grins
[18:35:14] <Patricia_> yea, ie8 sucks
[18:35:23] <RandalSchwartz> IE-anything sucks
[18:36:13] <snover> ie10 is pretty great actually
[18:36:45] <taybin__> I'm still surprised that jquery doesn't have a verbose mode to warn on stuff
[18:36:48] <Patricia_> but if your page is 100% static, you can set up the links in the create handler
[18:40:41] <Patricia_> ah, ound your bindInternalLinks, i think you are overcomplicating it!
[18:40:44] <Patricia_> *found
[18:42:02] <RandalSchwartz> yes?
[18:43:09] <RandalSchwartz> I was planning on simply s/_init/_create/g and s/tabsshow/tabsactivate/
[18:43:12] <RandalSchwartz> you do not concur?
[18:43:31] <Patricia_> you should be able to put this logic  into the create option of your tabs
[18:43:31] <Patricia_> $panel.find('a[href]').each(function() {
[18:43:31] <Patricia_> 			    var $a = $(this);
[18:43:31] <Patricia_> 			    var $href = $a.attr('href');
[18:43:31] <Patricia_> 			    var $index = $anchors.index($anchors.filter('[href="'+$href+'"]'));
[18:43:32] <Patricia_> 			    if ($index > -1) {
[18:43:34] <Patricia_> 				var $li = $lis.eq($index);
[18:43:36] <Patricia_> 				$a.click(
[18:43:38] <Patricia_> 					 function () {$tabs.tabs('select',$index)}
[18:43:40] <Patricia_> 					 );
[18:43:42] <Patricia_> 				// add hover-highlight as well
[18:43:42] <RandalSchwartz> whoa!  Maybe jsbin this?
[18:43:44] <Patricia_> 				$a.hover(
[18:43:46] <Patricia_> 					 function () {$li.addClass('ui-state-hover')},
[18:43:48] <Patricia_> 					 function () {$li.removeClass('ui-state-hover')}
[18:43:50] <Patricia_> 					 );
[18:43:54] <Patricia_> 			    }; // end if
[18:43:56] <Patricia_> 			}); // end foreach a
[18:43:58] <Patricia_> except instead of panel, use the container your tabs are in
[18:43:59] <systemfault> ...
[18:44:02] <systemfault> stupid.
[18:44:06] * RandalSchwartz wipes the paste from his screen
[18:44:21] <systemfault> Use a pastebin website when you have a ton of text to show us.
[18:44:25] <Patricia_> ah, sorry, it's just copied from your source. my bad
[18:44:47] <RandalSchwartz> if you can tweak it to work with 1.10 in jsbin, I will be forever grateful :)
[18:45:18] <RandalSchwartz> and perhaps get my $client to hire you
[18:45:33] <RandalSchwartz> yeah actually - doing it on show is silly
[18:45:43] <RandalSchwartz> should just be done once across the board
[18:45:53] <RandalSchwartz> now that you mention it
[18:46:03] <RandalSchwartz> I think that was in case it was dynamic
[18:46:52] <Patricia_> *making a fiddle*
[18:47:03] <RandalSchwartz> while rome burned!
[18:49:58] <RandalSchwartz> so I need to capture the _create event instead of _init, it looks like
[18:50:32] <RandalSchwartz> and thenif(this.option('bindInternalLinks')){
[18:50:50] <RandalSchwartz> modify *all* a[href] in scope
[18:51:18] <RandalSchwartz> actually - that code does that already.  But it does it on every show
[18:51:23] <RandalSchwartz> that's overkill :)
[18:55:34] <Patricia_> just put all that logic into the create callback, unless you have other tabs or something
[18:56:59] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, I can see that.  but behind the if() so that if that option isn't set, I get old behavior
[18:57:22] <Patricia_> is the option changed somewhere?
[18:58:05] <RandalSchwartz> default false
[18:58:57] <Patricia_> oooh, yes, i see that now
[19:00:22] <RandalSchwartz> but yes, I can just do this once on create based on the option setting
[19:00:28] <Patricia_> yea
[19:00:31] <RandalSchwartz> no need to hoook in to a show event
[19:00:40] <Patricia_> ope
[19:00:46] <RandalSchwartz> so I just need to s/_init/_create/g
[19:00:55] <RandalSchwartz> and then put everything inside a big "if" there
[19:02:06] <Patricia_> yea, and use the $tabs instead of $panel
[19:02:12] <RandalSchwartz> cool
[19:02:15] <RandalSchwartz> thanks for your help!
[19:02:25] <RandalSchwartz> $client is anxious to get this working
[19:02:33] <RandalSchwartz> and I have limited time since I'm also working for $client2
[19:03:26] <Patricia_> glad i could help a bit :)

[20:09:19] <hahahahahahahaha> Hello is anyone here? I am looking for help with creating a scroll detector for an infinite scroller. Unfortunately most of the examples online utilizing  $(window).scroll(); fire repeatedly upon your initial scroll to the bottom, instead of once you have reached the bottom of your second scroll
[20:09:33] <hahahahahahahaha> instead of the bottom of the updated height*

[20:22:10] <hahahahahahahaha> Once you reach the bottom of the page my next button is clicked, then I attach a div with a gif loading animation, and then after 1 second I remove the loading animation. This works great except if you scroll any further the detector fires everytime the scroll function is called
[20:22:35] <hahahahahahahaha> So multiple loading animations suddenly are appended to the page, even though I'm not at the bottom of the page yet
[20:24:57] <Whirled> Sounds like you have your event handler attached to the wrong set of code.
[20:25:54] <Whirled> Firefox requires updates every friggin time I launch I it. Complete BS
[20:27:49] <Whirled> hahahahahahahaha, perhaps you should toggle visibility on your scroller loader gif rather than constantly reattaching it
[20:28:16] <hahahahahahahaha> true
[20:29:24] <Whirled> Attach it to the parent container in the beginning and then on scroll, if needed, show the animation. Otherwise display:none
[20:31:37] <Whirled> hahahahahahahaha, you might want to look for a plugin called in-viewport.js or something like that. It will help you determine if items are within the viewport so you don't have to show the animation if already in viewport.
[20:44:39] <s2013> anyone here work with rails?
[20:55:00] <RandalSchwartz> like on the trains? :)
[20:55:42] <grafi> *starts the laugh track*
[20:55:47] <grafi> well done
[21:09:04] <s2013> yeah RandalSchwartz
[21:09:19] <s2013> but seriously. i am having trouble understanding how to get jquery to work with rails models
[21:09:58] <RandalSchwartz> even though ruby is the bastard child of my two favorite languages (perl and smalltalk), I still haven't wrapped my head around it.
[21:11:12] <s2013> if you are talking about bastard childs i hope you are talking about objective-c
[21:12:22] <RandalSchwartz> uh - no.  that's C crossed with smalltalk
[21:12:31] <RandalSchwartz> not perl crossed with smalltalk
[21:12:56] <RandalSchwartz> ruby owes a lot to both perl and smalltalk
[21:13:00] <RandalSchwartz> so says matz
[21:18:09] <clarkbox> anyone cool in here?
[21:19:10] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not very warm
[21:20:19] <RandalSchwartz> depending on your definition of "cool"...
[21:22:10] * RandalSchwartz wonders about clarkbox's intentions
[21:22:20] <clarkbox> just trolling.
[21:22:27] <RandalSchwartz> apparently
[21:22:41] <clarkbox> i know everyone in here must be cool because they are using jquery
[21:22:43] <RandalSchwartz> do you want a dialogue, or is that all there is.
[21:22:49] <clarkbox> that is all
[21:22:58] <RandalSchwartz> seems a bit pointless then
[21:23:57] <RandalSchwartz> oddly - I'll be even cooler in a few weeks for *not* using jquery because I'll be writing code in Dart
[21:30:10] <pixel_> hi
[21:30:22] <pixel_> i am trying to get the closest parent form
[21:30:45] <pixel_> var va = $(this).closest('form');
[21:30:50] <RandalSchwartz> .closest('form') yes
[21:31:05] <pixel_>  alert('name' + va.attr('formName') );
[21:31:11] <pixel_> says undefined
[21:31:21] <RandalSchwartz> is there a .formName on that?
[21:31:25] <pixel_> even tough if i do an console.dir(va); it shows an object
[21:31:42] <pixel_> i get an object in my va
[21:31:47] <RandalSchwartz> please use jsfiddle or jsbin to paste a minimal version of your problem
[21:31:52] <pixel_> now, how can i access the name of the form
[21:32:50] <RandalSchwartz> I bet it's .attr('name'), but I can't tell until you're done
[21:33:21] <pixel_> is not much code there are just these two lines
[21:33:49] <hemanth> pixel_, console.log(va.attr('formName')) says?
[21:33:51] <pixel_> yes, attr('name') got it
[21:33:51] <pixel_> :)
[21:33:55] <pixel_> the name of the form
[21:33:57] <pixel_> thank you
[21:33:58] <pixel_> :)
[21:34:00] <RandalSchwartz> aha
[21:34:01] * RandalSchwartz bows
[21:34:06] * RandalSchwartz hits head on desk
[21:34:07] <hemanth> heh heh
[21:34:07] <RandalSchwartz> ouch!
[21:34:39] <pixel_> now if i do va.addEventListener("submit", 'validatefunction' ); would it work?
[21:34:51] <RandalSchwartz> why not just "on"
[21:34:55] <RandalSchwartz> va.on(...)
[21:35:09] <RandalSchwartz> that's the jquery way
[21:35:21] <hemanth> va.addEventListener("submit", 'validatefunction' );  will also work, but you are mixing js and jq
[21:35:24] <pixel_> maybe there already are functions associated with the va.onSubmit() ...
[21:35:47] <pixel_> aren't those overwritten if i do an va.on ( ... ) directly?
[21:35:56] <RandalSchwartz> hopefully not :)
[21:36:12] <pixel_> :)
[21:36:19] <pixel_> i am not sure, that's why i am asking
[21:37:34] <pixel_> i was thinking if I do multiple va.on( ... ) .. the last code put on event remains and the previsious va.on ( .. ) is lost ( if any ) earlier in the document is lost
[21:40:31] <RandalSchwartz> no looks like they are cumulative
[21:40:35] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise you wouldn't need .off :)
[21:40:55] <pixel_> ok
[21:40:57] <pixel_> thank you
[21:48:16] <pixel_> ok, so i managed to get hold of the object i want in my va variable.. using the .closest() function.
[21:48:52] <pixel_> now i am trying to attach an eventhandler to it by using .addEventLisener() function but i get the error message [07:45:31.945] TypeError: va.addEventListener is not a function
[21:50:10] <RandalSchwartz> why are you not using jquery?
[21:50:14] <RandalSchwartz> va.on(...)
[21:50:34] <RandalSchwartz> don't keep mixing js and jq
[21:50:41] <RandalSchwartz> as was said earlier
[21:51:19] <hemanth> :)
[21:53:15] <pixel_> oh.. ok
[21:53:16] <pixel_> :)
[21:53:26] <pixel_> i thought that jquery is just a library of javascript
[21:53:37] <pixel_> and that i can use functions from javascript on jquery objects
[21:53:47] <RandalSchwartz> no
[21:53:52] <pixel_> ok
[21:54:10] <RandalSchwartz> a jquery object is a *list* of dom elements
[21:54:19] <RandalSchwartz> most javascript functions can't act on that
[21:54:29] <pixel_> assuming my va variable holds now a form object inside, i want to add the function validatefields() to its onSubmit event
[21:54:43] <pixel_> va.on( .. what parameters i put here .. ) ..?
[21:54:59] <RandalSchwartz> Please. Read. The. Fine. Manual.
[21:54:59] <pixel_> do i put va.on('event', functionname ); ? or?
[21:55:07] <pixel_> ok
[21:55:15] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:55:17] <pixel_> give me a link to the va.on ?
[21:55:18] <pixel_> ok
[21:55:26] <RandalSchwartz> dude.  learn to google a bit
[21:55:36] <pixel_> :)
[21:55:37] <pixel_> ok
[21:55:41] <pixel_> i googled all night
[21:56:24] <hemanth> all night! I'm curious about the search terms you used.....
[21:56:39] <RandalSchwartz> "girls" "2 cups" :)
[21:57:43] <hemanth> RandalSchwartz, lol
[21:58:28] <pixel_> haha
[21:58:30] <pixel_> :)
[21:58:54] <pixel_> ok.. i read the  http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:59:25] <pixel_> va.on("submit", validatefields );
[22:00:25] <pixel_> works
[22:00:27] <pixel_> :)
[22:00:41] <RandalSchwartz> oh wait, I got that backwards
[22:00:45] * RandalSchwartz grins
[22:02:03] <RandalSchwartz> I wouldn't even name that
[22:02:20] <RandalSchwartz> just va.on("submit", function (...) { ... } )
[22:02:35] <RandalSchwartz> I hate coming up with one-off names
[22:04:26] <pixel_> i suceeedeeeeeeeeed!
[22:04:26] <pixel_> i am so glad
[22:04:27] <pixel_> :)
[22:04:51] <pixel_> i am giving everyone a beer
[22:04:52] <pixel_> :)
[22:04:58] <pixel_> thank you guys
[22:05:06] <Cork> everyone?
[22:05:15] <Cork> that would be 733 beers :P
[22:05:46] <pixel_> yes.. anyone that is here
[22:05:46] <pixel_> :)
[22:05:59] <pixel_> most of the people are not
[22:06:00] <pixel_> :)
[22:06:25] <Cork> ah, ya, that's closer to 10 :D
[22:19:13] <RandalSchwartz> no more beer for me
[22:19:17] <RandalSchwartz> I'm low-carb high-fat
[22:19:58] <RandalSchwartz> beer is not on the list any more
[22:20:11] <RandalSchwartz> rum n soda tonight
[22:21:07] <Whirled> slow-carb ftw
[23:00:03] <foo> Whirl3d: ha, nice!
[23:00:39] <foo> I am trying to get this bootstrap layout working: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/examples/marketing-narrow.html - it's my first bootstrap attempt. Is there something special I need to do (eg. just changing CSS does not seem to work), or do I need to download something special? hmm.
[23:10:24] <otiuk> can anyone help me out with:  http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/  -- trying to have it alert if you click a link and the next div has a specific class
[23:11:33] <fella5s> i know i can .change(), but can i anyhow know if "change" was triggered by code?
[23:12:48] <ktada> fella5s: you can pass flag when you trigger .change event
[23:13:41] <ktada> fella5s: .trigger('change', <flag>);
[23:15:49] <fella5s> that was simple
[23:21:45] <ktada> otiuk: check http://jsfiddle.net/KGCRg/5/
[23:24:16] <otiuk> ktada: nice!
[23:49:12] <fella5s> ktada, found out that when i do .on('change', '.select', function(e){...}, e has "isTrigger" if it is triggered by code.
[23:49:31] <fella5s> so no need for other flags
[23:50:02] <ktada> fella5s: yah, its better solution.
[23:52:03] <otiuk> ktada: you mind taking a peak at:  http://jsfiddle.net/sDmnt/
[23:52:14] <otiuk> i don't know why size() isn't returning the correct number
[23:52:36] <otiuk> i'm guessing it isn't calling the closest ul to get the count of list items?
[23:55:13] <ktada> otiuk: check http://jsfiddle.net/sDmnt/1/
[23:57:18] <ktada> otiuk: note: .size() is deprecated from jquery 1.8
[23:57:33] <otiuk> oh ok
[23:58:32] <otiuk> it's returning a number, but i have a list that has dynamically added list items .. then when i could it shows away more than there are actually list items
[23:58:53] <otiuk> i'm thinking it's counting all li's on the page as opposed to just the li items in the ul
[23:58:57] <otiuk> or closest ul
