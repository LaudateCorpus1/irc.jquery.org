[03:02:10] <ParserError> I use a facebook module and when I called for the second time my page where the facebook module, the module does not appear
[03:04:29] <donni> hi
[03:04:37] <donni> can i append a table row?
[03:08:18] <ParserError> donni you need help me ?
[03:08:41] <donni> yes please ParserError
[03:08:57] <donni> i would like to append a table row
[03:09:34] <donni> but the row is in a middle
[03:10:43] <ParserError> oups, i need help !
[03:11:52] <donni> -_-
[03:12:34] <donni> ParserError, do you ne me to help you or do you want to help me?
[03:13:04] <ParserError> i'm NOOB ok ?
[03:14:12] <ParserError> send your question on this channel and wait
[03:15:45] <donni> ah okay ParserError, i thought you want to help me. so how can I help you?
[03:24:13] <ParserError> donni I load my index.php page then I called AJAX elements but these elements lose property CSS and JS
[03:26:54] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, so add the row . what is the problem you are facing
[03:27:20] <jop008> how to handle this text http://pastebin.com/SSDA86Ym
[03:27:21] <Vivekananda_y510> Parse error . drill into the problem and break it down see and check each step ie
[03:27:28] <jop008> received from server
[03:27:59] <Vivekananda_y510> find out if the css is being called at all. if yes find the initiator etch
[03:28:32] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 i append the row, but it displays on top of the table
[03:28:34] <Vivekananda_y510> ParserError, read this https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#viewing-exception-stack-trace
[03:29:13] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, do you have a working copy of the code to show , a fiddle maybe.  2. are you providing a logic to append it at the right place ?
[03:30:11] <ParserError> Vivekananda_y510 no i use firefox
[03:30:36] <donni> yes i do want to append it at the right place, how's the logic?
[03:31:08] <Vivekananda_y510> ParserError, similar strategy. hold on lemme find a link to that
[03:31:45] <Vivekananda_y510> a long winded but useful
[03:31:49] <Vivekananda_y510> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console  ParserError
[03:32:20] <ParserError> Vivekananda_y510 : http://kassaba.fr/KASSABA please see and click on accueil
[03:32:32] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, I mean do you have the correct logic in place. Since you say a row is added that means the adding logic ( code) works. now you need to see if you have added the logic for appending at the proper place
[03:32:35] <ParserError> yes i have already console dev
[03:32:52] <Vivekananda_y510> okay lemme try
[03:32:54] <ParserError> and 0 error
[03:32:56] <Vivekananda_y510> I am not an expert either
[03:33:03] <ParserError> ok
[03:33:27] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 i'll show the code
[03:35:57] <Vivekananda_y510> ParserError, clicking acculiel does not do anything for me
[03:37:07] <Vivekananda_y510> nothing happens
[03:37:44] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 please take a look http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/ i want to duplicate the row two and row three and its properti between row three and row four
[03:38:07] <ParserError> Vivekananda_y510 the square slider to the right, no longer works properly and the orange square on the left no longer displays the module facebook
[03:38:54] <Vivekananda_y510> donni that is only html. how are you doing the appending ie where is your javascripit/jquery code ?
[03:40:33] <Vivekananda_y510> ParserError, I dont see a square slider or any orange squares. I am on the main page and clicking Aculiel also does nothing for me at the moment
[03:44:34] <ParserError> (please read me, i'm french) = > Vivekananda_y510 the STRAIGHT slider to the right, no longer works properly and the orange STRAIGHT on the left no longer displays the module facebook
[03:44:49] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 here is how i do it http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/2/
[03:45:20] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 it seems not work, but when i do this out of table, it works
[03:49:19] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, try this http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/2/
[03:50:36] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 nothing changed
[03:50:58] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 please do update on jsfiddle
[03:52:27] <Vivekananda_y510> umm did you sorry try this http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/6/
[03:53:39] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, ^^
[03:57:57] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 this is the problem that  i face now http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/6/ , the row two and three is appending on top of the table, i actually wants the tabble append between the row three and row four
[03:58:44] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, got it. lemme try
[03:59:23] <donni> thank you Vivekananda_y510
[04:00:32] <Vivekananda_y510> :)
[04:10:37] <Vivekananda_y510> donni, try this http://jsfiddle.net/Se5wT/9/
[04:10:55] <Vivekananda_y510> also you were missing the closing brace for the button ie '>'
[04:11:05] <Vivekananda_y510> that is why the append was happenning at the top
[04:51:43] <jop008> how to unescape this string http://tny.cz/cfc80221
[05:19:01] <donni> Vivekananda_y510 it solved, thank you
[05:19:38] <Vivekananda_y510> no worries
[05:41:40] <jq-> How can I get the id of the href that's clicked to start a function?
[05:50:16] <donni> jq- $('#theid').onclick(){ function } ?
[05:51:15] <jq-> donni: I need the function to know which link is clicked, that would just call a function on click?
[05:51:46] <donni> $(this).closest('#theid')
[05:52:34] <donni> jq- use 'this'
[05:54:22] <jq-> I'm not sure I'm explaining this correctly.
[05:55:09] <jq-> A link with an onclick calls a function, the function needs to set a var with the id of the onclick'd object
[05:57:10] <decx> this.id
[05:57:48] <JenniferB2> Is it possible to read the contents of a link href response ?
[05:58:05] <JenniferB2> <link href='..'> innerHTML is empty ..
[05:58:09] <JenniferB2> even on the same domain
[05:58:32] <decx> that's not how innerHTML works
[05:59:10] <decx> you need to ajax it in separately
[05:59:11] <JenniferB2> ook ... but shouldn't I be able to get the content of the file? how?
[05:59:24] <JenniferB2> decx, really, ajax is nessecary for this?
[06:00:18] <decx> depends on the link type
[06:00:31] <decx> if it's a css it's somewhere in document.stylesheets
[06:01:21] <JenniferB2> i have it currently as text/plain ...
[06:01:38] <decx> then no
[06:02:01] <JenniferB2> document.stylesheets is empty
[06:02:04] <JenniferB2> undefiend
[06:02:15] <JenniferB2> i have other css links on the page though
[06:02:33] <decx> it's case sensitive
[06:02:34] <decx> document.styleSheets
[06:04:01] <JenniferB2> how about fetching the content using <script tag? I remember you were able to do this withough a ajax request, that is read the contetns of the js file or similar
[06:35:29] <johnny_good_> Hay, do you merge all js files into ong big file? Is there any cons to do that? My client app (on js files) has many dependency over all files (now I use separeted files), but some sections of my app doesnt use other files. I am confused

[07:42:29] <xelra> Hi guys! I want make one of these effect, where the background scrolls with the page. I've looked it up with google, but there are so many plugins. Any recommendations on which one I should use?
[07:43:21] <Jattenalle> xelra, use "fixed" on your background definition in CSS?
[07:43:45] <xelra> No, something like this: http://crumbs.am/
[07:44:07] <Jattenalle> oh, i see, paralax
[07:44:39] <Jattenalle> you can just have a background div that you scroll by a fraction of the scrollbar
[07:45:12] <Jattenalle> something like: myBackgroundDiv.top = pageScroll.top / 3
[07:45:19] <Jattenalle> (not actual code)
[07:46:54] <xelra> I see. So better ignore all the stuff on the web and DIY?
[07:47:15] <Jattenalle> well it's such a simple thing, i think any third party solution you grab will be overkill
[07:47:38] <Jattenalle> but that's just my opinion
[07:48:03] <xelra> Thanks.

[09:31:44] <Fr4NgUs> Hello guy
[09:31:55] <Fr4NgUs> i try to pass ajax form with laravel controller
[09:31:56] <Fr4NgUs> http://laravel.io/bin/Qkow4#6,9,11
[09:32:32] <Fr4NgUs> my complete code : http://laravel.io/bin/Qkow4#33-56
[09:32:55] <Fr4NgUs> alert ok when i submit but nothing change in my db as if controller do not execute
[09:33:01] <Fr4NgUs> i do not understand
[09:41:00] <grafi> well first make sure your controller is called ...
[09:41:10] <grafi> by returning some json
[09:41:22] <grafi> looking at that in the success function
[09:41:23] <grafi> ...
[09:43:24] <Fr4NgUs> ok
[09:44:13] <Fr4NgUs> ah yes
[09:44:17] <Fr4NgUs> but

[11:00:03] <michelem> hello folks
[11:00:50] <michelem> I want to control the amount of parallelism for .each() callbacks iterating over a long list of strings. How do you suggest to go?
[11:09:06] <Ansikt> michelem, can you provide an example?
[11:09:59] <michelem> I split a string in tokens and run .each() over it. Each callback makes an AJAX req. I don't want the server to get 200 rps.
[11:10:17] <michelem> I implemented this with a setInterval(callback, 333), effectively bounding to 3 rps
[11:11:13] <Ansikt> What do you find lacking in that solution?
[11:13:21] <michelem> nothing, just suspected jQuery may have something builtin

[11:48:04] <_biff> hi
[11:48:49] <_biff> i would like to know how the $.ajax url params works...i thought it can recieve only .php files...but what is that if anyone gives an url without given a php file...
[11:50:50] <Ansikt> _biff, can you provide an example?
[11:56:48] <_biff> ansikt example?
[11:57:45] <_biff> http://pastebin.com/vCy6Pzhi
[11:57:46] <_biff> :)
[12:08:39] <Ansikt> _biff: Sorry, I was doing laundry.
[12:08:57] <_biff> np:)
[12:09:41] <Ansikt> the $.ajax url just sends a request to that url - server on the other end paths that to whatever resource.  In many cases, url's don't have a filetype extension.
[12:10:07] <_biff> but from where to know which file should use
[12:10:38] <_biff> if i use a "folder" only in the url...
[12:11:15] <Ansikt> That's up to the server.  Traditionally, the server would just map the resource name to a location on disk - but now-a-days, that's not always true.  Take for example:
[12:11:41] <Ansikt> Here's how ruby on rails does it - http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
[12:12:19] <Ansikt> Expressjs on Node also works much the same way, as does J2EE/Spring/Grails.
[12:12:50] <_biff> can be used also url: '/areas/ownerajax.php'+jQuery(this).val() in such ases?
[12:12:52] <_biff> *cases
[12:13:14] <Ansikt> Depends on how that server is set up.  Maybe.
[12:13:30] <Ansikt> Also, what's an example value of $(this).val()
[12:13:34] <_biff> thast what i dont understadn..."server set up.."
[12:13:42] <_biff> i dont know this is not my code
[12:13:48] <decx> .phpvaluefrominput isnt a real file
[12:13:53] <_biff> and that would be the next question how comes to here an id...
[12:14:04] <decx> add ?
[12:14:15] <antlong> If anyone has a small amount of extra time, I create this open source game, www.multiverseminer.com, I could use a hand implementing some things like graphing and such. All in jQuery, and I would be super appreciative of any contributions. github.com/antlong/multiverseminer
[12:15:34] <Ansikt> _biff, the context of this is set to the DOM node currently being operated on.  .val() accesses the "value" attribute of that node.
[12:16:27] <_biff> ansikt i know...but not clear for me this url+id solution...
[12:17:32] <Ansikt> _biff - can you modify the code?
[12:17:33] <_biff> in thsi case there is an ownerajax.php...but what if if there is an ownerajax folder too
[12:17:47] <_biff> yes i can but i dont want to modify this part...this is not my task
[12:19:04] <_biff> i always used in jquery .php for urls
[12:19:21] <_biff> thats why i cant imagine how can this work...
[12:19:24] <_biff> :)
[12:21:03] <decx> if you want to add parameters to a request then add it to the url with ?& or use data in the ajax
[12:21:54] <Ansikt> _biff, Just for testing purposes, can you put alert($(this).val()); before the $.ajax line?
[12:22:06] <Ansikt> Then delete it afterwards, but I want to know what's in that value.
[12:37:34] <_biff> :)
[12:38:55] <_biff> yes i could...tomorrow...but it gives back an id of the area owner...and a combobox will fill up the related informations
[12:38:59] <_biff> *with the
[12:39:49] <Ansikt> _biff: and I assume the request isn't working?
[12:41:00] <Vivekananda_y510> hey everyone
[13:12:39] <Fr4NgUs> Good evening
[13:12:58] <Fr4NgUs> Someone know how can i reload only my img src after success ajax form
[13:14:19] <Fr4NgUs> Because i change the url of the image (in the db) and i want to reload after upload (with ajax) reload only the img src
[13:14:39] <antlong> like writing the image path?
[13:15:26] <Fr4NgUs> yep
[13:15:33] <Fr4NgUs> without refresh all page
[13:15:41] <Fr4NgUs> i want only reload src
[13:15:58] <Fr4NgUs> and in my controller i return json response
[13:16:06] <antlong> $("#element").http://stackoverflow.com/questions/540349/change-the-image-source-using-jquery
[13:16:07] <Fr4NgUs> an arrway with informatio nabout image
[13:16:55] <Fr4NgUs> yes but only reload i can't
[13:17:04] <Fr4NgUs> because my src is stock in my db
[13:20:15] <Fr4NgUs> ?
[13:39:26] <igcewieling1> My actual use case is much more complicated, but I think I've simplified the issue.   I have a click handler $('#fnordbox').click(function () { ... } , but the #fnordbox element is loaded into the page using an ajax call after the page loads (i.e. dynamically) is there an easy way to make the clickhandler attached to the new element?
[13:41:03] <igcewieling1> I'm still a bit of a n00b if it isn't obvious from my question.    Even some pointers on the right terms to google for would be helpful.
[13:42:38] <antlong> I need a suggestion or two, on a super simple plugin to display a real time line graph. Every second, I want to pull a value from localStorage, and use that in the graph. Everything I've looked at so far has seemed like overkill though. Mostly everything that uses D3.
[14:13:35] <antlong> Has anyone used morris.js?
[15:16:18] <Bauer> what is the simplest framework to utilize jquery to quickly build a basic site based on ajax request/responses?  I want to build simple site based on index page which loads all scripts, and jquery is used to dynamically do AJAX requests and remove/add HTML elements dynamically... I am in a rush to quickly do this project... I need something with minimal learning curve
[15:17:14] <tectonic> Backbone?
[15:17:53] <Bauer> tectonic: its addon on top of jquery?
[15:18:11] <tectonic> yea, but you could also just use straight jQuery if the page is simple
[15:20:15] <Bauer> tectonic: well perhaps some background: I am very late submitting a Java based web application (task is vacation ordering system). what I need to do now is the View(s) which would get data from controllers for various actions, and display the data. thats it basically.. normally I dont do much client side stuff
[15:20:45] <Bauer> tectonic: given that background, and that I do have some experience with jquery/javascript, backbone is good choice?
[15:21:24] <tectonic> Backbone is very simple, and works well if you know jQuery.  There are plenty of other options too.  If you want live data binding, for example, other choices are better.
[15:21:33] <tectonic> But for simple Ajax data -> view, Backbone is good.
[15:25:19] <Bauer> tectonic: quick skimming of examples, events and models - I am not sure how it would help? this framework does not generate the html elements for me on the fly, right? it just defines events, objects etc...
[15:25:47] <tectonic> the view rendering is still left up to you, but most people use underscore / mustache templates
[15:26:02] <Bauer> whats that?
[15:28:26] <tectonic> see backbone.js here: http://todomvc.com/
[15:32:49] <Bauer> thanks tectonic , hmmm nothing so far seems to be as fast as doing it dirty by hand, using simple jquery ajax calls
[15:33:25] <Bauer> even simple todo storage samples have structures that will take time to learn, time I dont have
[15:33:47] <tectonic> if you're in a rush, use what you know
[15:34:36] <Bauer> yeah :( I was hoping there is a faster way to create the HTML elements, and just hook to them using jquery..
[15:34:44] <Bauer> than doing so by hand
[15:36:02] <Vivekananda_y510> hi jquery people
[16:04:29] <Fr4NgUs> Hello all
[16:04:53] <Fr4NgUs> how can i disable mouseover event before send jaax form and active after success ?
[16:05:15] <Fr4NgUs> because i wan when i submit my ajax form mouseenter and mouseleave event disable
[16:05:42] <tectonic> Bauer: might be worth looking at http://handlebarsjs.com/ then
[16:08:17] <Bauer> tectonic: thanks, but its not quite what I was hoping for... I continue manually with what I know as you suggested for now
[16:08:48] <Bauer> just googling around snatching templates for basic pages to build on what I need :)
[16:12:52] <Fr4NgUs> because i wan when i submit my ajax form mouseenter and mouseleave event disable
[16:12:54] <Fr4NgUs> how can i disable mouseover event before send jaax form and active after success ?

[16:42:00] <docmur> I'm trying to catch my return status from PHP, this is my code in jquery:  http://pastie.org/9408120,  I know what is being returned from PHP as I alert the return status, what I'm I doing wrong?
[16:44:09] <Woet> docmur: where is the rest of your code?
[16:44:42] <docmur> Well that is all of the jquery, I could post the rest of it but it's a fair amount of HTML and PHP
[16:45:01] <Woet> no, the rest of your jQuery code. check out the examples and see what you're missing
[16:45:24] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[16:47:44] <antlong> are sliders used a ton in web design/dev? It seems like theres 4 plugins for sliders for every 1 of something else.
[17:00:37] <docmur> Well I changed it back to use reponse, status, xhr.  But with the code: http://pastie.org/9408131  not matter what I send back {"status":"error"} or {"status":"success}  my first if will always pass if( status == "success" ), the alert is always showing success, but I know that PHP is returning both statments as I put them into the header div
[17:01:22] <pcfreak30> How would you go about creating something like this: http://i.imgur.com/rMjMl1W.png
[17:11:22] <tectonic> pcfreak30: like what?
[17:13:24] <pcfreak30> tectonic: google commonly makes some sort of interactive site walkthrough for new features
[17:14:04] <tectonic> http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-joyride-feature-tour-plugin
[17:20:06] <Xoro> http://jsfiddle.net/Mxuhb/ Can anyone tell me what's wrong with the code here? It's just a simple tab script but it only runs once.
[17:20:39] <tectonic> Xoro: looking
[17:22:37] <Fr4NgUs> Someone know how can i limit mouseenter
[17:22:39] <Fr4NgUs> mouseleave
[17:22:56] <Fr4NgUs> because if i multi hover div my mousehover is x hove div
[17:23:10] <Fr4NgUs> i wont do that because
[17:24:22] <Fr4NgUs> with the fadein
[17:24:26] <Fr4NgUs> ;)
[17:25:01] <docmur>  I changed the load statment to use reponse, status, xhr.  But with the code: http://pastie.org/9408131  not matter what I send back {"status":"error"} or {"status":"success}  my first if will always pass if( status == "success" ), the alert is always showing success, but I know that PHP is returning both statments as I put them into the header div
[17:25:06] <tectonic> Xoro: odd, i don't see the issue
[17:25:49] <Xoro> Really? If I click the admin tab I can't click Main to get back, if I click Main the hover CSS on admin doesn't trigger and I can click it but not return to main.
[17:26:22] <tectonic> Xoro: wait, there's no tab-2"
[17:26:26] <tectonic> no #tab-2
[17:26:43] <tectonic> i only see tab-1 in the HTML
[17:26:53] <tectonic> so i suspect badly formed HTML
[17:27:00] <Xoro> That's in the HTML, it's .hide() until I click it.
[17:27:36] <tectonic> no, I searched the HTML with command-f and there's no tab-2
[17:27:39] <Xoro> Line 181 has it
[17:28:05] <tectonic> not on jsfiddle
[17:28:15] <tectonic> oh
[17:28:19] <tectonic> reloading found it
[17:28:20] <tectonic> weird
[17:28:50] <tectonic> make sure your HTML is correctly closed and nested, though, because I suspect that
[17:28:55] <blakespot> greets
[17:29:13] <Xoro> Okay.
[17:30:01] <blakespot> so I will literally pay someone $100 to take this left nav I have using jquery animations for hover and make it also work on an iPad with tap, smoothly.
[17:30:08] <blakespot> IS anyone interested?
[17:30:11] <blakespot> Is, rather
[17:30:21] <blakespot> http://parentalcontrols.qa.cble.co
[17:30:39] <blakespot> you can see the commented app.js file linked in the HTML
[17:31:00] <blakespot> PAyPAl works
[17:31:11] <blakespot> I am in a bind
[17:32:03] <blakespot> It has sizing issue in landscape - portrait should be the test target
[17:36:21] <blakespot> .js file is commented clearly for the code working on that nav
[17:38:59] <blakespot> I can add in an include to a remote .js file to facilitate if anyone is interested in the $
[17:39:04] <Woet> blakespot: there is an error in your JS preventing execution of your on click handler.
[17:39:09] <Woet> line 207 in app.js
[17:39:20] <Woet> lacking a $ at the beginning
[17:39:32] <Woet> ("#intCenterBlockImageChoose") should be $("#intCenterBlockImageChoose").
[17:39:42] <mephx> hey guys. when body's overflow-y is set to scroll, and some other element's overflow-y is set to scroll, when scrolling inside the element is there a way to prevent scrolling the body when start/end scroll of overflown element has been reached? thanks!
[17:43:12] <blakespot> Thanks for that
[17:43:16] <blakespot> That helps
[17:43:44] <blakespot> still -- getting this damned thing that works for hover on desktop to work for tap on iPad --- i have spent days
[17:44:13] <blakespot> Can additional jquery calls get it done?
[17:44:35] <Woet> blakespot: i told you what the problem is.
[17:44:44] <Woet> can you please fix that problem and go from there?
[17:45:02] <Woet> because it's not yet fixed on the URL you gave us.
[17:45:22] <Woet> you actually added a second problem by adding  $('#intMainBlockHome-' + currSlide).fadeOut('slow'); to the index
[17:45:24] <blakespot> yes ir' local let me push it out -- but that is not the touch issue
[17:45:26] <Woet> which is ran before you include jquery
[17:45:38] <blakespot> ah local js
[17:45:42] <blakespot> on trans
[17:45:42] <Woet> okay, update the demo page with the fixed and i'll take a look
[17:45:48] <blakespot> ok
[17:45:49] <Woet> fixed version*
[17:45:51] <blakespot> hold
[17:49:39] <blakespot> pushing out the repo now
[17:49:41] <blakespot> hold
[17:50:21] <blakespot> repo live on QA
[17:50:23] <blakespot> reload
[17:52:46] <Woet> well it's a nightmare going through your code
[17:53:02] <Woet> there is so much duplication
[17:54:13] <Woet> but i don't have an ipad  and the site doesn't work on an iphone
[17:54:18] <Woet> so i can't replicate it
[17:55:04] <blakespot> well it sort of works on an iphone -- needs work
[17:55:12] <blakespot> this project is killing me
[17:55:22] <blakespot> I was a backend guy
[17:55:28] <blakespot> was
[18:27:21] <Jagst3r21> any idea why the mobile toggle is not working here? http://underscores.jamesageiger.com/
[18:36:09] <mdev> is .bind still used
[18:36:12] <mdev> or replaced with .on ?
[18:37:50] <tw2113> from the bind docs: "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[18:42:05] <psdn> Hello jquery folks. If I was using getJSON in a document ready, how would I keep iot listening? As if maybe the server would would generate 2 or 3 o6 sets of return data at the time of document.ready?
[19:03:11] <mdev> is there a way
[19:03:36] <mdev> say I have <input text id=blah> then after it I have <div class="note">
[19:03:55] <mdev> anyway I can access the class note after the input text, for that particular element when i catch it via a
[19:04:05] <mdev> keyup or whatevera and have access to it via this
[19:04:21] <mdev> likt $(this).nextelement.class(note).dowhatever
[19:04:23] <mdev> or something?
[19:04:51] <mdev> this would be awesome for accessing the class i'm after for all controls without needing a unique id for it, in addition to the unique id for the text boxes
[19:05:10] <mdev> the class comes after the input box thoguh, it's not part of it, need the message underneath
[19:07:19] <mdev> I figured it out
[19:07:44] <mdev> let's see if anyone is clever enough to get ti, someone else helped me in here previously with something similar I just did the opposite and should work
[19:08:21] <mdev> guess is too tricky
[19:08:27] <mdev> it should be something like
[19:08:28] <mdev> this.nextAll('.note').eq(1).addClass("hide");
[19:08:48] <mdev> to add a hide class to the .note class that comes after my input text box, gonna test now!
[19:14:18] <mdev> .first().html('test message'); for it to work!
[19:14:24] <mdev> jquery is so awesome :)
[19:15:55] <karamazov> Anyone use jquery.transit before? I'm trying to use it to rotate an image but can't prevent the animations from queueing
[19:18:39] <qwertyoup> Hello.  Would anyone here be able to spare a few moments to help me with a jQuery problem?  Can't figure out why $(this).data('whatever', variableHere); is returning undefined.
[19:22:15] <antlong> does anyone know of a plugin to achieve this sidebar? http://www.2ndwavers.com/images/toolbar-long.jpg

[20:55:10] <petey> Hey guys, I'm trying to animate a certain set of classes
[20:55:21] <petey> the namespace is .fade and then ive got .fade.one, .fade.two, .fade.three
[20:55:46] <petey> the problem is that when I do $(.fade).animate({}) it will only work on the default value for .fade instead of one/two/three
[20:55:48] <petey> anyone have any suggestions>
[21:13:06] <WillPittenger> Is it possible to get the contents of an inline script from a jquery call?
[21:51:14] <guest13421> http://jsfiddle.net/LNPp2/. I want to limit the scroll to items in my div tag.

[22:10:14] <sammych1> ladies: what's the best way to do the 'hide element above view until scrolled into' like how search is usually hidden until the user scrolls down to reveal it?
[22:10:43] <sammych1> should I just scrollTo() to the element below the search on page load?
[22:10:50] <sammych1> it's mobile so there isn't a scroll bar
[23:19:20] <Catz`> hi, i have a link pointing to #, is there any way to hide that # when someone clicks it? I am using the # link because i have a dropdown menu
