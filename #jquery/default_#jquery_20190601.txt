[14:40:18] <SpecialTech> Question, if there's an XHR payload that's being sent, and the password of a user is visible on the frontend/network tab, can third parties be able to retrieve that password from the xhr payload?
[14:45:21] <pavonia> Is it an https request?
[15:25:56] <SpecialTech> pavonia yes
[15:33:56] <pavonia> So it's safe on the wire, but browser addons can certainly read it
[15:35:02] <pavonia> I guess other JS code on the site could even write a wrapper function around the .ajax call
[15:56:48] <Cork> SpecialTech: just to be clear sending data over xhr is as safe as a normal https form post
[15:57:10] <Cork> SpecialTech: it isn't guaranteed "safe" but it is reasonably safe to do
[15:57:38] <Cork> (there are loads of way to brake the security of https)
[15:59:38] <Cork> also if you load third party js you don't know you can trust, you will NEVER be able to make a secure site
[15:59:51] <Cork> and is loaded into the page is the page
[16:00:43] <Cork> i meant "and what is*"
[16:14:05] <TheSourcerer> Hi! Is it possible to disable the href magic of loading the new page with ajax for a specific link, so that it becomes a plain <a href='...'> link that just redirects to a different page that does not use jquery?
[16:24:04] <shoky> "href magic" ?  are you talking about jquery mobile?
[16:25:15] <TheSourcerer> Yes, jquery mobile
[16:26:50] <shoky> people still use that? yikes. seems pretty dead
[16:32:44] <shoky> seems  data-ajax="false" might be what you're looking for
[16:34:31] <shoky> also  http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/navigation-linking-pages/#LinkingwithoutAjax
[16:39:49] <TheSourcerer> shoky: Thanks a lot! That helped.
[22:46:45] <delizin> Hey all. I am having a weird issue with a selector in Chrome. I am trying to remove a table row based on it's ID. Every row uses the same ID with a row number at the end. If I use the selector '#row123' it works, but if I use '#row'+'123' it does not work. In the console it appears that both are selecting the proper element. https://dpaste.de/3rhb  Any ideas would be welcome. Thank you
[23:04:51] <pavonia> Show the code that doesn't work
[23:06:38] <delizin> From my paste bin above: $('#row_task_pending'+'43').remove(); does not work. However $('#row_task_pending43').remove(); works.
[23:07:10] <delizin> Functionally, they should be the same.
[23:07:51] <delizin> My suspicion is that it might be a bug in my version of Chrome.
[23:11:20] <pavonia> delizin: I meant something that can be replicated
