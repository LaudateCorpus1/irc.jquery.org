[01:14:41] <xec> what does the "j" stand for in jQuery ?
[01:15:33] <Uhkis> i'm pretty sure it's for "javascript"
[01:15:42] <xec> that makes sense
[01:16:04] <Jax2> Hi there, is anyone familiar enough with the jquery form plugin that they might be able to assist me?
[01:16:05] <xec> i was thinking it might be "John"
[01:16:08] <xec> as in resig
[01:17:08] <xec> or maybe it stands for "Jay" :D
[01:17:33] <Uhkis> like homer j simpson? :D
[01:17:37] <xec> right ;D
[01:18:36] <xec> Jax2: if you state the problem in its entirety, it's more likely to make people intrigued (and get help)
[01:18:54] <xec> (i have no idea what "the jquery form plugin" is)
[01:19:08] <Cork> xec: http://ejohn.org/blog/barcampnyc-wrap-up/#postcomment
[01:19:24] <Cork> jquery was originally meant to be called JSelect
[01:19:34] <Cork> but the domains was taken :)
[01:19:42] <Jax2> I am trying to submit a form using jquery.form.js so that it displays the result of the form submission inside a div without refreshing the page (Basically, it is taking user submitted answers to a puzzle and seeing if they're correct and returning a correct or incorrect statement) but the page keeps going to the actual check_answer.php page rather than displaying the result in the div as it should. I have no idea why. It was working fine yet now it's not.
[01:19:51] <Jax2> http://pastebin.com/gEu9ZPwQ is the page in question
[01:20:04] <xec> Cork: ok, but what does the J stand for in JSelect then :D
[01:20:37] <Uhkis> JSelect even has JS in it!
[01:21:00] <xec> thats true
[01:21:08] <xec> maybe it's Javascript elect?
[01:21:08] <xec> :D
[01:21:33] <Cork> xec: i suspect it was a combination of javascript and his name
[01:21:37] <Uhkis> from the page "both of which were quite successful"
[01:21:48] <Uhkis> yeah, jquery has been "quite" successful project :D
[01:21:52] <Cork> heh
[01:22:19] <Uhkis> doubt he ever dreamt of jquery getting this big
[01:22:30] <Uhkis> even*
[01:22:49] <Uhkis> well, both work
[01:23:48] <xec> i'm gonna do var jayQuery = jQuery; in all my projects either way
[01:23:49] <xec> ;D
[01:23:59] <xec> afk
[02:04:09] <placidb> Uhkis, I don't mean to ask too much of your time, but I'm still stumped with the issue. just wondering if you have any suggestions on how to fix it?
[03:43:59] <hellyeah> yo
[03:45:33] <pokergod> $("#test").height() gives 0.20, but $("#test").css("height") gives 549px, why is that?
[03:46:01] <hellyeah> hey dont get it why it prints that http://jsfiddle.net/77z72tpa/2/
[03:47:10] <Uhkis> hellyeah: because .text is a reference to the function, text() would be the function call
[03:47:30] <pokergod> Uhkis, any idea on my problem?
[03:48:18] <Xatenev> 0.20?
[03:48:22] <Uhkis> pokergod: #test probably doesn't have content in it and is that why 0 height
[03:48:23] <Xatenev> show an example plz
[03:48:58] <Xatenev> Uhkis: but height and css height shud almost give the same
[03:49:05] <Xatenev> .height() should return 549
[03:49:14] <Xatenev> if css("height"); returns 549px
[03:49:45] <pokergod> could it be because the container is relative?
[03:49:57] <Uhkis> Xatenev: says who
[03:50:05] <Xatenev> Uhkis: jquery documentation
[03:50:13] <Uhkis> !api height
[03:50:13] <b-ot> Uhkis: .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[03:50:24] <Uhkis> *computed* height
[03:50:44] <Xatenev> hm
[03:50:54] <Xatenev> k den
[03:50:57] <pokergod> I have a draggable bar that I want to resize the top half of the window with the bottom half of the window
[03:51:24] <Uhkis> ?demo @ pokergod
[03:51:29] <Uhkis> ?demo
[03:51:29] <b-ot> Uhkis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:51:34] <Uhkis> ^ pokergod
[03:51:42] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/77z72tpa/8/ text is not a function can you tell my mistake here?
[03:52:28] <Xatenev> hellyeah: element is no jquery object i guess
[03:52:41] <hellyeah> ah
[03:52:46] <hellyeah> i need to wrap
[03:52:49] <Uhkis> hellyeah: you want $(element)
[03:52:59] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/77z72tpa/9/
[03:53:10] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/77z72tpa/10/
[03:53:26] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  yeah deails i forgot everytime
[03:54:03] <hellyeah> but that didnt print anything
[03:54:13] <Xatenev> what should it print?
[03:54:20] <Xatenev> all ur buttons are submit buttons
[03:54:23] <hellyeah> text propert of button
[03:54:24] <Xatenev> there is no text
[03:54:38] <hellyeah> text="ECourse_Prod|Monitor"
[03:55:01] <Uhkis> hellyeah: that would be attr('text')
[03:55:12] <hellyeah> yeah i have this idea now
[03:55:26] <hellyeah> .text() prints the value at the facade of button right
[03:55:59] <Uhkis> that would be val() on an input
[04:01:14] <Cork> hellyeah: if you have control of the html i would recommend using <button> instead of <input type="submit">
[04:01:39] <Cork> input submit has a lot of formating mombojombo that makes it a pain to deal with
[04:10:20] <hellyeah> Cork:  html side of code is controlled by asp.net
[04:10:30] <hellyeah> i dont have any interference unfortunately
[04:10:36] <hellyeah> i am using asp.net web forms
[04:19:45] <Boogymanx> Hey guys, I'm having an issue with this script https://dpaste.de/0u8i
[04:20:31] <Boogymanx> I'm trying to store values from checkboxes in an array so I can send them to the backend, but whenever a user unchecks a checkbox ( https://dpaste.de/0u8i#L40 ) indexOf returns -1
[04:21:10] <Cork> Boogymanx: just use .serialize()
[04:21:20] <Boogymanx> Cork: where should I use that?
[04:21:24] <Cork> Boogymanx: though you need to have a <input type="hidden" for when they are unchecked
[04:21:31] <Cork> Boogymanx: to get the checkboxes
[04:21:48] <Boogymanx> Cork: will that fix the issue i'm having with the indices?
[04:23:54] <Cork> Boogymanx: http://jsfiddle.net/a6jL2pmo/
[04:25:07] <Boogymanx> Cork: The value of the checkboxes corresponds to their ID in the db though, I can't just have them as 0 and 1
[04:25:25] <taplar> it's a poc
[04:25:29] <Cork> Boogymanx: you should have the id in the name
[04:25:40] <Cork> Boogymanx: else you can't store a state of when they get unchecked
[04:25:59] <Boogymanx> But I don't need to store the state, I just need to remove the value from the array
[04:26:03] <Boogymanx> well
[04:26:06] <Boogymanx> I guess that is storing the state
[04:26:28] <Boogymanx> I just don't get how indexOf can return -1 on an array element when that element is in the array
[04:26:31] <Cork> Boogymanx: well sure, set the id as the value, and remove the hidden field
[04:26:50] <compact> hi guys. I've got google maps on my tablet (web based on my website). how can i make it so if somebody holds on the screen on the map, it drops a marker
[04:27:03] <Boogymanx> Cork: but then I come to my original issue of array.indexOf(id) always returning 1
[04:27:05] <Boogymanx> -1*
[04:27:20] <taplar> your creating regios as an array of checked checkboxes
[04:27:22] <Cork> Boogymanx: indexOf isn't a jquery function
[04:27:28] <Cork> you sholuld use .index() instead
[04:27:58] <Boogymanx> Cork: then I get $regios.index is not a function
[04:28:08] <Cork> regisons isn't a jquery object
[04:28:11] <Cork> that is an array
[04:28:25] <Cork> (your varaible names is very php:y)
[04:28:50] <Boogymanx> Yeah, I got feedback a couple days ago on this script and the guy who looked at it said I should use $var
[04:28:51] <Boogymanx> not sure why
[04:28:52] <Cork> ah, ugg
[04:29:01] <Cork> O_o
[04:29:08] <Cork> Boogymanx: no, that is bull
[04:29:31] <Cork> some ppl want to use $ infron of variable names that contain jquery collections
[04:29:45] <Cork> but you should definitely NOT use it on every variable name
[04:29:55] <Cork> it just makes the code confusing to read
[04:30:25] <compact> hi guys. I've got google maps on my tablet (web based on my website). how can i make it so if somebody holds on the screen on the map, it drops a marker
[04:30:33] <Cork> Boogymanx: ok this code is really confused
[04:30:50] <Cork> Boogymanx: you brab a label with $("label[for='"+$(this).attr('id')+"']") and then you do $label.val()
[04:30:59] <Cork> $label is a <label> it doesn't have a value
[04:31:22] <Boogymanx> You can add a value attribute
[04:31:31] <Boogymanx> and get that with .val()
[04:31:33] <Boogymanx> wait
[04:31:48] <Boogymanx> hmm
[04:31:49] <Boogymanx> no
[04:31:53] <Boogymanx> I should've used .attrs('value') there
[04:31:58] <Cork> why would you have a value attribut on a label??
[04:32:02] <Cork> no you shouldn't
[04:32:12] <Cork> don't make up random arguments
[04:32:20] <Boogymanx> because the checkboxes are auto-generated by a framework and I can't modify them easily
[04:32:25] <Cork> if you need to store extra data ALWAYS use data- prefix on the name
[04:32:42] <Cork> else you have a VERY high right colliding with the specs
[04:32:50] <Cork> right??
[04:32:54] <Cork> *chance
[04:33:05] <taplar> rate?
[04:33:10] <Boogymanx> ok so I changed the name to data-value and access it with .data('value')
[04:33:37] <Cork> Boogymanx: also line 30-36 can be replaced with $vacancy_list.html(response.join(''))
[04:34:47] <Boogymanx> hmm
[04:34:53] <Boogymanx> I'm assuming the same is true for line 67-75?
[04:35:19] <Cork> yes
[04:35:23] <taplar> is that the exact same ajax call?
[04:35:34] <taplar> if so extract that bad boy
[04:36:50] <Boogymanx> Cork: response.join is not a function
[04:37:02] <Boogymanx> I got the same error when I used .index() instead of .indexOf
[04:37:02] <Cork> Boogymanx: give me a bit i'm trying to clean this up
[04:37:08] <Boogymanx> okay, sorry
[04:37:10] <Boogymanx> thanks for the help
[04:37:21] <taplar> actually now that i look at it, the only difference looks to be where your getting the value from
[04:38:07] <Boogymanx> what do you mean taplar?
[04:38:42] <taplar> both the contents of the if and else look to be identical, except how you get the $label variable value
[04:38:59] <Boogymanx> The only thing the code should do is add an item to an array if the checkbox goes from unchecked -> checked and remove an item from the array if the relevant checkbox goes from checked -> unchecked
[04:39:38] <Boogymanx> I agree it could be a lot cleaner, but I had to create this site from scratch in eight weeks and I only have two left
[04:39:41] <taplar> then what is the ajax call for?
[04:39:55] <Boogymanx> oh
[04:39:56] <Boogymanx> yeah
[04:40:08] <Cork> Boogymanx: there a first clean up http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/
[04:40:13] <Boogymanx> after the changed checkbox state it sends an ajax request that should return updated search results
[04:40:56] <taplar> think your missing a $ on ln 24
[04:41:23] <Cork> next batch of cleanups http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/1/
[04:41:28] <Boogymanx> I removed the $s from my code as they were apparently unnecessary :p
[04:41:36] <Boogymanx> well the $ preceding a variable name
[04:41:37] <taplar> they are
[04:41:40] <Boogymanx> not the $ for calling jquery
[04:41:56] <taplar> sure sure
[04:42:16] <taplar> but as Cork said earlier you can use them to signify the element is a jquery object if you want
[04:42:25] <taplar> just don't go overboard
[04:42:33] <Cork> Boogymanx: i would start by getting the html match the code in the last fiddle
[04:42:54] <Cork> after that we can start looking at it again if it still fails
[04:43:30] <Boogymanx> Cork: Using your code, I get an error on response.join
[04:43:32] <Cork> actually when we're at it you can remove the strings in the options for $.ajax
[04:43:34] <Cork> makes them easier to read
[04:43:55] <Boogymanx> they don't need to be strings?
[04:43:56] <taplar> another thing that kinda seems odd
[04:44:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/2/
[04:44:05] <taplar> though a small thing
[04:44:18] <Cork> Boogymanx: if you get that error it means response isn't an array
[04:44:25] <Cork> but then your for loop shouldn't work either
[04:44:38] <taplar> ln 33, your getting the thing, and then emptying it.  and then replacing it.  but you could just start with an empty thing to begin with and skip the empty step
[04:44:52] <Boogymanx> yes, but I'm updating already-existing search results
[04:45:00] <Boogymanx> so if that div is empty at start it's no good :p
[04:45:15] <taplar> or no.... just the empty as is could be removed
[04:45:21] <Cork> Boogymanx: what is response?
[04:45:24] <Cork> what does it contain?
[04:45:25] <taplar> since your doing html instead of append
[04:45:32] <Boogymanx> Cork: just added console.log
[04:45:50] <Boogymanx> Cork: well, the HTML that needs to be in the div
[04:45:54] <Cork> O_o
[04:46:03] <Cork> so you copy the html character by character?!?
[04:46:08] <Cork> why??
[04:46:39] <Cork> just do $('#vacancy_list').html(response); then
[04:46:59] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/3/
[04:47:09] <Boogymanx> My client wanted different CSS classes on mouseover for the returned results
[04:47:25] <Boogymanx> and the easiest way to do it was just write all necessary HTML by hand in the backend
[04:47:37] <taplar> but this is the frontend....
[04:48:15] <Boogymanx> yes, but it gets the data it needs from the backend and whether I put it in proper html in the front-end or back-end doesn't really matter
[04:48:21] <Boogymanx> or at least I don't think it does, I could be wrong
[04:48:24] <Boogymanx> I'm a noob webdev really
[04:48:41] <Boogymanx> that does look a lot better though to be honest
[04:48:44] <Boogymanx> and it works :D
[04:48:45] <Cork> Boogymanx: ya, but we need to start by cleaning up this code so it gets readable
[04:49:05] <Cork> could you try getting the latest fiddle working with the html you have and see if that makes a difference?
[04:49:23] <Uhkis> so as a "noob webdev" you took a low deadline project? i think there's a lesson to be learned here ;-)
[04:49:34] <Cork> oh... wait...
[04:50:01] <Cork> Boogymanx: is #region_list inside the #vacancy_list ?
[04:50:02] <Boogymanx> Uhkis: I needed the money
[04:50:24] <Boogymanx> no, they're both in a container at the same level
[04:50:55] <Cork> hmm just noticed it can be cleaned up a bit more
[04:51:19] <Boogymanx> man I want your JS skills
[04:51:22] <Boogymanx> and jQ of course
[04:51:31] <taplar> here's one for Cork.  you think he would be better off keeping a list of the checkboxes and instead of doing the whole index thing, just building the array each time off of the filtered :checked elements?
[04:51:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/4/
[04:51:44] <Cork> yes
[04:51:55] <Cork> that was kinda what i suggested to start with
[04:52:09] <taplar> ah missed that
[04:52:10] <Cork> this solution depends on keeping a separate state in an array
[04:52:21] <Cork> and nothing breaking the sync between what the user sees and that array
[04:52:34] <Cork> that means extra data, and extra fragility
[04:52:42] <Cork> == normally something you should avoid
[04:53:34] <Boogymanx> What could the issue be?
[04:54:04] <Cork> over engineered code
[04:54:08] <Boogymanx> I mean, why is it something to be avoided
[04:54:08] <Boogymanx> ah
[04:54:12] <Boogymanx> well, yeah
[04:54:22] <Boogymanx> I really just don't know the most efficient solutions yet
[04:54:41] <Boogymanx> really my current codebase is built on trial-and-error which is far from efficient
[04:55:35] <Boogymanx> anyway, thanks for the help Cork and taplar - if any of you are ever in Belgium and want a beer/some weed, hit me up :p
[04:56:13] <Cork> Boogymanx: http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/6/http://jsfiddle.net/zdwetm9o/5/
[04:56:21] <Cork> that is how i would recommend doing it
[04:56:47] <Uhkis> what's up with belgium and webdeving :D
[04:57:09] <Uhkis> for some reason a lot of the "big names" come from belgium
[04:57:24] <compact> hi guys. I've got google maps on my tablet (web based on my website). how can i make it so if somebody holds on the screen on the map, it drops a marker
[04:59:09] <Shoarua> Boogymanx, keep trying you'll get there :)
[04:59:54] <taplar> i don't think i could name one "big name".  must be out of the loop, heh
[05:00:53] <Uhkis> taplar: me neither, but that's just because those belgian names are too damn hard to spell! :D
[05:01:09] <taplar> lol
[05:02:43] <Uhkis> https://www.drupal.org/user/1 this guy i would say is a pretty big name in webdev
[05:02:47] <Boogymanx> we use the roman alphabet like most Western countries :p
[05:03:18] <taplar> ah
[05:05:39] <Boogymanx> Cork: I'm getting a missing ) error on this line         return labels.filter('[for="' + this.id '"]').data('value'); even though I'm not sure why
[05:06:04] <Uhkis> you're missing + after this.id
[05:06:09] <Cork> ah ya
[05:06:31] <Boogymanx> hmm
[05:07:44] <Boogymanx> Yup, that fixed it :)
[05:08:37] <Duikb00t> Uhkis Dries :P
[05:09:06] <Uhkis> what am i drying? :-D
[05:09:24] <Boogymanx> hahaha :p
[05:09:37] <Boogymanx> anyway, again - thanks for the help, let me know when you're in Belgium and I can repay the favor
[05:09:40] <Boogymanx> Cork , taplar ^
[05:40:03] <jax> hello
[05:40:13] <hellyeah> hey
[05:40:32] <jax> what's the right way to run a request before a button's href is triggered? in console the request gets cancelled as soon as the new page loads - isn't waiting for the request to finish
[05:40:47] <SirLagz> jax: why is a new page loading?
[05:40:50] <SirLagz> jax: what does the button do?
[05:41:04] <jax> just navigate to another page (new domain). but some tracking needs to get a hit first
[05:42:32] <Cork> jax: by button you mean an <a> tag?
[05:43:10] <jax> yes
[05:43:15] <Cork> then you can't
[05:43:27] <jax> i can use <button> too
[05:43:30] <Cork> as the browser follows the href it will stop all js AND ajax calls
[05:43:41] <jax> can i make a blocking request somehow?
[05:43:42] <Cork> only option you have is to not use a link
[05:43:45] <Cork> no
[05:43:49] <jax> can i do window.location after the request?
[05:43:55] <Cork> yes
[05:44:06] <Cork> but that would be a really poor user experience
[05:44:17] <Cork> jax: so, why do you want to do this?
[05:44:28] <jax> because the client wants tracking when somebody hits the button
[05:44:34] <jax> conversion goal..
[05:44:45] <jax> google does this everywhere with their e-commerce tracking
[05:44:48] <Cork> well you could use the ping attribute
[05:44:57] <Cork> though most privacy tools will block that
[05:45:07] <Cork> you could also use a proxy and redirect the urls
[05:45:12] <Cork> (prob the better option)
[05:45:39] <jax> proxy as in another page?
[05:45:55] <Cork> so instead of doing href="http://www.example.com" you do href="/proxy/163423"
[05:46:08] <Cork> and /proxy redirects to http://www.example.com
[05:46:17] <jax> yup good idea
[05:48:15] <jax> thanks
[06:13:35] <bluenoser> I need to detect mouse dragging with an svg panning library. AFAIK, it doesn't use jquery-ui's draggable. Is jquery-ui's draggable only to let you move things (which is already being handled by the svg lib), or can I use it in this case too?
[06:16:32] <bluenoser> In other words, I just need a way to check if the mouse is dragging. I can already pan with the svg library.
[06:57:04] <SirLagz> how can I find out why a click handler isn't firing? I'm trying to use a $('input[type=radio]').each() to attach a click handler onto a whole bunch of radio buttons but it doesn't seem to attach it, or it's not firing
[06:57:08] <SirLagz> it works in a fiddle though =/
[07:02:23] <SirLagz> ah...It must be bootstrap mucking something up =/
[07:31:19] <whoknows> hi guys

[07:32:25] <whoknows> It won't scroll left, or just won't scroll at all
[07:36:56] <whoknows> guys?
[07:38:03] <hellyeah> sup
[07:38:10] <whoknows> hey
[07:38:29] <whoknows> can ye help with bxslider?
[07:39:00] <hellyeah> dunno sorry
[07:40:22] <whoknows> :<
[07:59:57] <fas3r> hello, fadein() is not suppose to remove the style "display:none" of the element ?
[08:15:43] <adv_> anyone has used photoswipe? can't figure out how to display the responsive/large controls on a mobile device. the official docs don't mention anything
[08:34:42] <taplar> fas3r: i would think fadein would have to remove display none
[08:38:09] <Xatenev> fas3r: it works and removes the display:none
[08:38:21] <Xatenev> fas3r: http://jsfiddle.net/kxstj6qz/
[08:43:12] <esaym153> in jquery, how to prompt the browser to download a file?
[08:44:20] <taplar> you can open the url to the file in a new window or possibly an iframe
[08:45:50] <taplar> let me see if i can make it talk
[08:45:56] <taplar> !g javascript window.open()
[08:45:57] <b-ot> taplar: Window open() Method - W3Schools → http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_open.asp
[08:46:27] <taplar> sweet
[08:55:58] <esaym153> taplar: ok, didn't know if there was a 'jquery' way to do it. The issue is that the file to download is generated. And might take several minutes. So the user needs a dialog box that basically says "this will take awhile, click OK to continue", but I would like the dialog box to stay up until the download is done. Not really sure how to do that (right not it just calls location.replace(url) )
[08:56:33] <esaym153> right now*
[08:57:03] <taplar> i'm not sure you can tell with javascript when a download is done.  kinda out of its domain
[09:03:37] <esaym153> taplar: yea, that is what I am seeing when googling, dang
[09:08:59] <fas3r> how can I do ... hide all element with the class "test" except "this" one where this is the current element/selector
[09:10:38] <fas3r> I found .. sorry.
[10:03:55] <Nickname2> Hi
[10:04:43] <Nickname2> hi
[10:04:49] <robertmaxrees> hello
[10:06:27] <taplar> heh, guess the first nickname didn't work out so well
[10:07:04] <robertmaxrees> haha
[10:09:57] <taplar> aww, he left?  hope he wasn't offended
[10:10:27] <robertmaxrees> he left a while ago.
[10:11:52] <robertmaxrees> like, after I said hello 5 minutes ago.
[10:12:13] <taplar> ah
[10:12:21] <robertmaxrees> probably just testing to make sure irc works for them.
[10:44:10] <Utils> I'm playing around with jquery ui tabs, but I was wondering how add in two buttons to move the scrollLeft < or >, so when there are too many tabs, it doesn't overlap but rather gets "hidden" and the arrows scroll.
[10:44:23] <Utils> However, with the ul being the actual tab bar, not sure how i add in those buttons.
[10:45:01] <jimmt> what's wrong with this selector? http://i.imgur.com/F005lj8.png
[10:45:12] <jimmt> what I'm reading is saying that's how you select for elements with data set to a certain value
[10:45:19] <robertmaxrees> jimmt use .get()
[10:45:20] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/qu0L21j1/11/ this is what I've got. ideally I'd like [<|>] buttons on that blue bar on the right side of the actual tabs and that will scroll. I can do the scrolling, but not sure how I'd do it in the dom.
[10:45:22] <robertmaxrees> don't use []
[10:45:32] <robertmaxrees> err, use .eq()
[10:45:33] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> and use .filter() for selecting off data attributes.
[10:46:19] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't necessarily edit the markup, so those selectors don't work.
[10:46:19] <jimmt> is the [] syntax invalid now then?
[10:46:26] <jimmt> oh
[10:46:30] <robertmaxrees> it's not "invalid", it's just rarely what you want.
[10:47:51] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, don't select on data attributes either wya.
[10:47:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not really what they're for.
[10:50:51] <jimmt> $("body").filter(function(){return $(this).data("id") != undefined;}) isn't finding anything
[10:51:03] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you use filter for this.
[10:51:13] <robertmaxrees> filter goes through the current collection.
[10:51:31] <jimmt> that's how the example of filter I found was structured
[10:51:38] <robertmaxrees> in the api docs?
[10:52:03] <jimmt> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1009523
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> use the api docs.
[10:52:16] <robertmaxrees> amd ypiu
[10:52:25] <jimmt> I guess it should've been $("*")
[10:52:30] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:52:31] <robertmaxrees> $('span').filter(function() { retrn $(this).data('id') === 13 });
[10:52:37] <robertmaxrees> $('*') is sloooowwww.
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> $('[data-id="foo"]') is pretty bad, too.
[10:53:18] <jimmt> it's not a big page
[10:53:35] <robertmaxrees> still a good idea to not use attribute selectors and *
[10:53:42] <taplar> typically you should have an idea of the type of elements the data should appear on
[10:53:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:53:56] <robertmaxrees> typically you don't select on data attributes anyway
[10:54:49] <taplar> even if it is multiple tags, $('div, span').filter(...) is better than '*'
[10:55:21] <zigzagzig> i'm looking for a jQuery plugin that will put a little message on the screen when the user loads the page like "enter your info here! -->"
[10:55:25] <zigzagzig> i forget the name of the plugin
[10:55:42] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:55:47] <zigzagzig> its like a little tooltip arrow
[10:55:50] <zigzagzig> looks like handwriting
[10:55:55] <zigzagzig> with a curved arrow pointing at elements
[10:56:10] <taplar> sounds like a stylized tooltip
[10:56:26] <zigzagzig> i saw a specific plugin for it.. gotta do some more googlin
[10:56:58] <zigzagzig> its not a tooltip persay because it shows on page load
[10:57:03] <zigzagzig> not hovering over an element
[10:57:13] <taplar> that's just the implementation of display
[11:03:56] <arup_r> I want to select all <tr> which has a attribute like "data-id" . How to do ?
[11:04:08] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[11:04:16] <robertmaxrees> even better - give them all a shared class.
[11:04:21] <robertmaxrees> and select that class instead.
[11:04:57] <arup_r> not attribute selectors are there.. I did not see any https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:05:06] <robertmaxrees> there are attribute selectors, but they're slow.
[11:05:22] <robertmaxrees> and data attributes, depending on how you set them, aren't something you can select on anyway.
[11:05:27] <arup_r> ok
[11:05:35] <arup_r> right
[11:09:04] <Shoarua> filter is amazing
[11:09:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:09:18] <robertmaxrees> all day every day
[11:12:47] <SwK> so appearently sync XMLHttpRequests (via jQuery.ajax) on the main thread are prohibited... so how do you load config data that is required for an app to actually run the main thread and block the main thread until its done?
[11:12:57] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[11:13:05] <robertmaxrees> you put your init in the .done() callback.
[11:17:51] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: I am doing like $(".someclass sometag").remove("some html");
[11:17:56] <SwK> thats about assbackwards
[11:18:00] <arup_r> still you want me to use filter()
[11:18:06] <robertmaxrees> arup_r huh?
[11:18:25] <arup_r> dunno :)
[11:18:25] <taplar> remove removes elements, not html
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:18:34] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with filter
[11:19:10] <arup_r> I understood. Why you asked me to use filter().. I am asking .. is $(".someclass sometag") is slow ?
[11:19:30] <robertmaxrees> i was saying to use .filter() instead of attribute selectors.
[11:19:54] <arup_r> ok.
[11:20:07] <robertmaxrees> but really, you should avoid attribute selectors in the first place.
[11:21:51] <arup_r> so how should I write?
[11:22:09] <robertmaxrees> write what?
[11:22:17] <taplar> what domain object do your data-id reference?
[11:22:28] <arup_r> taplar: it is user id
[11:22:44] <taplar> so <sometag data-id="something" class="user">
[11:22:47] <robertmaxrees> give the elements a class called "user-id or something.
[11:22:49] <arup_r> http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/GpoXVE example
[11:22:50] <taplar> and select $('.user')
[11:23:15] <arup_r> ok. And I want to delete all matching elements from the table..
[11:23:19] <arup_r> what is the method ?
[11:23:21] <robertmaxrees> give them a shared class.
[11:23:23] <robertmaxrees> delete that class.
[11:23:51] <arup_r> I gave.. how to destroy all matched nodes from the selector
[11:23:56] <robertmaxrees> .remove()
[11:24:34] <arup_r> ok
[11:26:11] <Utils> I can't find any good scrollable tabs, ones that have < and > buttons. Basically I have a dynamic amount of tabs, so just need a way to handle that and they're horizontal.
[11:26:25] <robertmaxrees> Utils you're probably going to have to build that yourself.
[11:26:29] <jimmt> no post data is arriving to my php page from $.post("page.php", {a:"1", b:"2"}, function(data){})
[11:26:44] <robertmaxrees> jimmt check your network tab.
[11:26:49] <robertmaxrees> that getting trough successfully?
[11:26:53] <jimmt> the post request happens but there's no post arguments
[11:26:57] <jimmt> I can see it in apache's log
[11:27:06] <robertmaxrees> "arguments" or body?
[11:27:23] <jimmt> the list of key value pairs that php puts into $_POST
[11:27:32] <taplar> don't you need dataType: 'json'?
[11:27:39] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[11:28:04] <taplar> or i'm thinking $.ajax
[11:28:12] <jimmt> an example from the docs is  	
[11:28:12] <jimmt> $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[11:29:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, should work just fine.
[11:29:59] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[11:30:20] <robertmaxrees> also, check the post in your network tab to make sure there's a post body there.
[11:30:26] <robertmaxrees> if there is, and apache is seeing it, then it's a php problem.
[11:30:49] <jimmt> I looked in the network tab, didn't see any post data
[11:31:01] <robertmaxrees> is it 404ing or anything like that?
[11:31:04] <jimmt> actually there is now
[11:31:05] <jimmt> in params
[11:31:10] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:34:10] <jimmt> just forgot how awful php's object syntax is for a minute
[11:34:23] <taplar> hmm?
[11:34:41] <taplar> you mean the -> accessor?
[11:34:53] <jimmt> something wasn't happening because I forgot you need $this-> to access member variables of the object you're in scope of
[12:01:34] <Scriptonaut> Hey guys, I have a form, it is submitting twice, unless I return false. e.preventDefault alone isn't enough. Why would this be happening? Could it be propogating/bubbling? Here's tghe code: https://gist.github.com/robins35/e5166acd0c2b43060b59
[12:02:43] <robertmaxrees> aaaah coffeescript.
[12:02:51] <robertmaxrees> mind giving us the native js version?
[12:03:08] <Scriptonaut> ya sure
[12:03:46] <robertmaxrees> also, why are you removing and re-binding a delegated listener?
[12:03:53] <robertmaxrees> half the point is that you don't do that.
[12:04:02] <Scriptonaut> you mean the off before the on?
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:04:19] <Scriptonaut> I'm using this thing called turbolinks, where it doesn't actually make new requests, it just loads parts of the pages that change
[12:04:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:04:31] <robertmaxrees> so why remove the listener?
[12:04:37] <Scriptonaut> if I don't do off/on on submit and click it defines them twice for some reason
[12:04:45] <Scriptonaut> so I end up with 10+ click/submit events after a while
[12:04:46] <robertmaxrees> that means your code is getting run twice.
[12:04:57] <robertmaxrees> is this js apart of the code that gets brought into the page?
[12:04:59] <Scriptonaut> only for click events for some reason
[12:05:14] <Scriptonaut> the JS should all get loaded initially
[12:05:23] <Scriptonaut> and no more js is really ever loaded (though it can be)
[12:05:35] <robertmaxrees> that's what's happning here then.
[12:07:29] <Scriptonaut> you mean that's why my code is executing twice?
[12:07:33] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:07:45] <Scriptonaut> why would it be twice when I turn it off then on
[12:07:56] <robertmaxrees> rather, that's why the event handlers are getting re-bound.
[12:08:00] <robertmaxrees> that .off() is code smell imo.
[12:08:07] <robertmaxrees> and the propagation issue is, too.
[12:08:21] <robertmaxrees> how many times does #login appear on the page?
[12:08:26] <Scriptonaut> just once
[12:08:30] <robertmaxrees> you're sure?
[12:08:37] <Scriptonaut> positive I checked
[12:08:44] <robertmaxrees> you did $('[id="login"]').length ?
[12:08:50] <Scriptonaut> yep
[12:08:54] <robertmaxrees> because $('#login').length will always return 1.
[12:09:00] <robertmaxrees> then no idea without a fiddle.
[12:09:13] <Scriptonaut> gah
[12:09:15] <Scriptonaut> you were right
[12:09:21] <Scriptonaut> $("#login") only ever returns 1
[12:09:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:09:23] <Scriptonaut> there are 2
[12:09:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:09:29] <robertmaxrees> so start by fixing that.
[12:09:32] <Scriptonaut> that's a good thing to know
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> might not resolve the base issue.
[12:10:11] <Scriptonaut> I think it will, it was propogating up to the modal that surrounded the form
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[12:11:06] <Scriptonaut> yep that was it :) thanks
[12:11:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:21:53] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, may I ask you a question about HTML?
[12:22:11] <robertmaxrees> almost 700 people in the channel, but sure ;)
[12:22:33] <claytonzaugg> lol you're the best though, unless someone else can answer, then you're second best!
[12:22:43] <plamble> rekt
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:22:48] <claytonzaugg> :)
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question
[12:22:54] <robertmaxrees> asking to ask is... weird.
[12:23:12] <claytonzaugg> It's because I'm in JQUERY not HTML, that's why the formality in asking to ask
[12:23:22] <claytonzaugg> anyway, let me get to it
[12:24:51] <claytonzaugg> So I've had an issue the last couple of days with <video> not working as it should and my question is if you know of any reason that would cause <video autoplay loop> not to autoplay?
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[12:26:26] <plamble> anyone know a good tutorial on jquery form submission for someone that barely knows jquery
[12:26:33] <claytonzaugg> Chrome and Safari
[12:27:29] <claytonzaugg> I can right click and hit play though!  Also, lopp is already checked, it's just autoplay that doesn't kick in
[12:27:46] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg i vaguely remember chrome not allowing autoplay.
[12:27:49] <robertmaxrees> i could be wrong though.
[12:29:13] <claytonzaugg> Freak, it could be a setting in my chrome plug-ins... https://www.maketecheasier.com/disable-video-autoplay-firefox-chrome/
[12:30:55] <claytonzaugg> hmm nope
[12:32:38] <Cupertina> Is there a way to programmatically get the pages a user has liked on facebook?
[12:32:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:33:17] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg yeah, lots of reading about chrome not allowing autoplay.
[12:33:18] <claytonzaugg> You mean is there a way to access a Facebook API that lets you know what pages a user has liked?
[12:33:30] <Cupertina> claytonzaugg: Yes
[12:33:53] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/likes/
[12:34:25] <claytonzaugg> gosh dangit robertmaxrees, that's frustrating! Any jquery advice to get these to start playing?  Premise is I'm replacing large gifs with HTML video for an emulator I'm running and I need these to autoplay
[12:34:38] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg why?
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> autoplay videos are the devil.
[12:35:07] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: Nice. So do I have to register for the api or do I just run that request?
[12:35:42] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api
[12:35:46] <robertmaxrees> everything you need is in here.
[12:35:51] <claytonzaugg> It's part of the emulator experience.  It's "emulating" looking at a screen where you'd see live video from a camera.
[12:36:09] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg then have a "launch" button or something that does everything for you.
[12:36:38] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: Yes, but it would save me alot of time if you have any experience before that you could indicate whether or not I have to register first
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> teachin' you to fish ;)
[12:38:33] <claytonzaugg> Trust me Cupertina, robertmaxrees knows his business and learning to fish is the best thing you can do.
[12:38:45] <robertmaxrees> Cupertina https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview everything you need to know is on this page.
[12:38:59] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: Ok, thank you sir, I will read that page
[12:40:27] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: It says "Most Graph API requests require the use of access tokens which your app can generate by implementing Facebook Login."
[12:40:35] <Cupertina>  robertmaxrees: but it doeesn't say which ones
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview#step2
[12:40:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:43:36] <robertmaxrees> what to do for lunch...
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> hrm..
[12:43:53] <claytonzaugg> I just had pizza, it was delicious.
[12:44:04] <robertmaxrees> i havent' done pizza for lunch in ages.
[12:44:09] <claytonzaugg> Of course it was a food truck pizza though
[12:44:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm, i wonder what today's food truck has.
[12:44:25] <claytonzaugg> they have a brick oven in their truck, very cool
[12:44:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we've got a place locally like that, too.
[12:45:33] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: I'm using the Graph Explorer demo now, but it's telling me that my token has expired
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean  "An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.",
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:47:34] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: Would I need permission from the user who I want to see the likes for?
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:47:57] <robertmaxrees> you can't access any information for any user you want.
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> they need to give you that info willingly.
[12:48:13] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: Oh damn, that's what I was looking to do
[12:49:47] <claytonzaugg> Facebook cherrishes their data Cupertina, they want to make sure they know what you're doing with it :)
[12:51:53] <Cupertina> So there is absolutely no way to do this? :(
[12:52:20] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to mine that data?
[12:52:41] <claytonzaugg> Not unless you can hack the planet. Facebook makes serious money with that kind of data, do you really think they'd let anyone without their knowledge easily aggregate it? They'd lose money.
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> Cupertina why do you want everything a user has "liked"?
[12:53:46] <Cupertina> robertmaxrees: I have my client's email addresses, so I was thinking if I could somehow see what pages they are liking on facebook then I could have a better idea what product to target at them
[12:53:56] <robertmaxrees> that's only mildly creepy.
[12:54:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:55:00] <Cupertina> Can you send a message via the API?
[12:55:07] <Cupertina> *message then
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> probably not?
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> why not just message them directly?
[12:55:35] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i grab lunch
[12:55:37] <Cupertina> hmm
[12:56:30] <Cupertina> So what's the real purpose of the API then?
[12:56:38] <Cupertina> As in, why would I program anything for myself
[12:56:43] <Cupertina> pertaining to facebook
[12:57:03] <Cupertina> if I was to see my data, I would just log into facebook with the browser
[12:58:44] <claytonzaugg> There are plenty of companies out there that aggregate data Cupertina, perhaps you can check with them about obtaining data through their means.  For example, take a look at http://www.nuvi.com/ for example
[13:01:04] <Cupertina> claytonzaugg: When you say there are plenty of companies out there that aggregate data, what do you mean?
[13:02:01] <claytonzaugg> Many companys, like nuvi, aggregate data from social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.  That's how THEY make money, and then show the data a user wants in a nice organizaed way.
[13:02:36] <claytonzaugg> go to www.nuvi.com and check out their video or scroll down to read about them. I believe Domo does the same thing.
[13:02:54] <Cupertina> claytonzaugg: How do they do that? are they working with facebook or something?
[13:03:33] <claytonzaugg> They get access to the data from Facebook, so yes they do have a working business relationship with them
[13:04:03] <taplar> data == $$$
[13:06:08] <JosefDe> Hi guys. We're living in a modern age, and I'm not able to do a .show() on an element which has class "hidden"?
[13:06:42] <taplar> show removes the style of hidden, if you do a custom class that does the hide you have to take care of that yourself
[13:07:01] <JosefDe> taplar: Yes. I'm using a custom css class
[13:07:11] <JosefDe> taplar: What do I have to do, to remove that class assignment?
[13:07:13] <Zzaichik> so instead of .show()  .css('display', 'block');
[13:07:15] <JosefDe> removeClass() doesn't work
[13:07:18] <taplar> right, so you'll have to do the removeClass('hidden')
[13:07:24] <JosefDe> That doesn't work
[13:07:25] <JosefDe> No effect
[13:07:33] <JosefDe> Probably it collides with jQuery-UI
[13:07:36] <Zzaichik> sounds like a problem with the codes.
[13:07:50] <Zzaichik> .on()
[13:08:05] <JosefDe> ?
[13:08:37] <taplar> JosefDe: double check that the element does not have both the class and the style to display none it.  if it does not, then make sure your selector is selecting your element correctly
[13:08:53] <taplar> if still no, after doing the logic inspect the element in your browser and see where the display none is coming from
[13:13:54] <buzzybron1> hi, i have this row of values which i retrieve from ajax, to append to a table
[13:14:28] <buzzybron1> but right now when i am trying to select it to check if the element is there, it doesn't return a me the lenght value
[13:15:00] <taplar> 'select it', what is it?
[13:15:06] <Zzaichik> what's the event you're using
[13:15:43] <buzzybron1> select as in the jquery selector
[13:15:54] <taplar> but what are you selecting? the table?
[13:15:59] <buzzybron1> i'm not using any event, just an auto timer
[13:16:07] <buzzybron1> selecting the row that inserted
[13:17:00] <taplar> uh, i'm heading out but you'll probably need to make a fiddle.  there's a few code smells here just from the description.
[13:17:08] <taplar> l8r all
[13:18:22] <JosefDe> display block doesn't work..
[13:18:40] <Zzaichik> JosefDe: it sounds like your event is not firing
[13:18:42] <JosefDe> Is there really no option for showing a element with class hidden?
[13:18:51] <JosefDe> I want to cry
[13:19:12] <Zzaichik> put a console.log in your event and make sure it's actually being triggerec
[13:19:18] <Zzaichik> triggered*
[13:21:26] <JosefDe> How can I hide newly inserted html-elements with $('body')?
[13:21:48] <JosefDe> like this: $('body').on('change', '.container1 .branch',
[13:21:54] <Zzaichik> Because it sounds like you're not even making it that far.    $('body').on('event', 'element', function() { show the stupid thing; });   might just do the trick.
[13:22:11] <Zzaichik> yeah - that's right
[13:23:07] <Zzaichik> you should create a jsfiddle JosefDe
[13:23:12] <Zzaichik> easier to help
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> weee
[13:53:26] <Zzaichik> wee indeed, wee indeed.
[13:53:47] <hassoon> nope
[13:58:20] <jak2000> hi all, is possible add an HINT per cell? in a HTML table?
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[13:59:05] <Zzaichik> like a tooltip?
[14:00:09] <jak2000> yes
[14:00:10] <jak2000> something: http://postimg.org/image/uq87xz5xt/
[14:00:15] <jak2000> yellow rectangle
[14:00:20] <robertmaxrees> alt text.
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use a tooltip library
[14:01:11] <jak2000> ok thanks
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> powertip is one option.
[14:04:10] <Zzaichik> title attribute
[14:04:15] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah that.
[14:05:59] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/
[14:06:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:07:47] <jak2000> thanks
[14:40:40] <tomasm-> hi, I'm sending some post data to a server that expects data to be in JSON string format (ie not url encoded).... how can I do this?
[14:41:18] <tomasm-> ie data: JSON.stringify(params) ? or something else?
[14:43:21] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> just make sure your JSON is in the first format.
[14:44:28] <tomasm-> first format?
[14:57:13] <robertmaxrees> err, correct format.
[15:08:15] <Synthead> can I encode some text to be ampersand-escaped (effectively the same as dom.text("<html">))?
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> encodeURIComponent iirc.
[15:09:08] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: aren't URIs percent-escaped?
[15:09:27] <robertmaxrees> oh, derp.  good point.  why do you want it to be html escaped?
[15:10:35] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I'm overriding jQuery UIs' dialog's _title method.  I want ampersand-escaped text with "real" HTML appended.  I'm going to add some "clickable" icons.
[15:10:49] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:11:35] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: so like "text text blah blah <I'm escaped>", then <img src="foo.jpg"> after
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> so then append it as a textnode.
[15:13:34] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: hm, that's one way to do it
[15:14:07] <robertmaxrees> something here smells.  do you want to actually the <> & etc.?
[15:14:08] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I was hoping to do title.text(escape_somehow(this.options.title) + "<html stuff>")
[15:14:32] <Synthead> or sorry, title.html
[15:14:41] <robertmaxrees> just append it as text and then append the markup you care about.
[15:16:50] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I was kinda thinking that
[15:17:01] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: lemme experiment with it.  thanks!
[15:17:11] <SpecialTechnique> Hey Robert, how can I achieve what I'm trying to do here? http://jsfiddle.net/sype99qq/
[15:17:26] <robertmaxrees> .each
[15:18:46] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that though?
[15:21:57] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique like, i can think of 2 different ways to do that which don't involve javascript.
[15:22:15] <SpecialTechnique> it needs to be javascript :l
[15:22:18] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:22:24] <SpecialTechnique> I'm trying to learn
[15:22:36] <robertmaxrees> that's probably the worst reasoning :)
[15:22:43] <SpecialTechnique> I want to learn?
[15:22:44] <SpecialTechnique> xD
[15:23:38] <robertmaxrees> knowing when to not use javascript is a good skill.
[15:23:52] <SpecialTechnique> I know I can do this through HTML obviously, lol
[15:23:56] <robertmaxrees> and through CSS>
[15:24:13] <SpecialTechnique> But it's just trying to learn a different route, you never know :)
[15:24:39] <robertmaxrees> i've never found a case where i need to do something like that where it wasn't better to simply edit the HTML and CSS.
[15:25:08] <SpecialTechnique> CRO is pretty hot right now and deals with stuff like this
[15:25:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:25:26] <SpecialTechnique> conversion rate optimization
[15:25:51] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with editing markup with javascript?
[15:26:27] <robertmaxrees> like, if you're using an A/B testing platform that uses javascript to modify things, you're gonna have a bad time.
[15:27:21] <SpecialTechnique> Hah, I know, but like I said, you never know - I'm a designer and just want to expand my skill set.
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> whatevs.
[15:28:17] <robertmaxrees> as a developer with a lot of experience, doing that kind of stuff is usually a bad sign.
[15:28:24] <plamble> does this look correct
[15:28:25] <plamble> http://pastebin.com/i1Zh06qm
[15:29:48] <robertmaxrees> 'email': $('input[name=email']).val(),
[15:29:54] <robertmaxrees> that's wrong.
[15:30:03] <plamble> why
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> look at where the closing square bracket is.
[15:30:21] <robertmaxrees> should be inside the quote.
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> not outside.
[15:30:37] <plamble> whoops
[15:30:52] <robertmaxrees> also, need to remove the semicolon from the }) for the .done() setup.
[15:30:57] <robertmaxrees> oitherwise you can't chain the fail on ther.e
[15:31:47] <plamble> roger
[15:31:54] <robertmaxrees> also some bad closing paren/curly braket stuff.
[15:32:03] <plamble> the stuff thats being sent through the ajax request looks right?
[15:32:34] <robertmaxrees> should be fine?  that .ajax() call isn't jquery's so i dunno.
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:40:46] <SpecialTechnique> robert what would you suggest to use for a/b testing?
[15:55:23] <MaxMeents> hi!!
[15:56:43] <MaxMeents> question- when using each to do something like $().text(i) it only shows the end result, I need to excute one loop then another, not all of them at once
[16:05:46] <jakesyl> hey guys!  Here's my code: https://ide.c9.io/jakesyl1/latingenerator I'm trying to, using index.php and search.php setup a ui AutoCompletion here: https://latingenerator-jakesyl1.c9.io/.  It's not returning anything
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> login?
[16:06:19] <jakesyl> really?
[16:06:22] <jakesyl> alright I'll gist
[16:06:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:06:25] <robertmaxrees> try jsfiddle.
[16:06:35] <jakesyl> but php
[16:06:45] <robertmaxrees> javascript knows nothing about php.
[16:06:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:07:36] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like your issue is php related.
[16:08:02] <jakesyl> true, here's the js code: https://jsfiddle.net/eundk8sf/ (from jquery dox), and here's my search.php output: https://latingenerator-jakesyl1.c9.io/search.php (which I'm sure is the issue, i just don't know what javascript wants) Here's the example I am using: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[16:08:19] <robertmaxrees> check out what the response looks like.
[16:08:28] <jakesyl> yeah it is.  I can make the php output anything to make the js work.  What should the php be spitting out?
[16:08:58] <robertmaxrees> you said you're using jquery ui autocommplete?
[16:09:10] <jakesyl> yep
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[16:09:51] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:09:59] <jakesyl> k
[16:11:44] <jakesyl> it is submitting a request to search.php witht he code I have now, it's just not parsing it correctly
[16:12:56] <jakesyl> when I hit enter, I get Selected: undefined aka undefined So I'm doing something wrong with the json
[16:14:24] <robertmaxrees> from your PHP you mean?
[16:14:49] <jakesyl> nah, the javascript outputs that
[16:15:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log(ui);
[16:15:57] <robertmaxrees> what does that give you?
[16:16:00] <jakesyl> right now for testing the php is hardcoded to output this every time: https://gist.github.com/jakesyl/d3c5a5fd4a08162c6d58
[16:16:24] <robertmaxrees> not what i asked :)
[16:17:50] <jakesyl> nothing...
[16:17:56] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[16:18:07] <jakesyl> it's not getting ui..
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> right - http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[16:18:38] <robertmaxrees> make sure this is all working like you expect.
[16:18:40] <jakesyl> but I have the source set to search.php
[16:18:53] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab to make sure it's correct.
[16:19:06] <robertmaxrees> both the request and the response
[16:19:07] <jakesyl> it is
[16:19:18] <jakesyl> search returns: { "ui": { "item": { "value": "term", "id" : "id" } }}
[16:20:22] <jakesyl> http://i59.tinypic.com/1218nbm.png
[16:20:30] <jakesyl> http://oi59.tinypic.com/1218nbm.jpg
[16:20:40] <jakesyl> second one, first one has ads and crap
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> slow down yo.
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> so what happens if you put console.log(ui); as the first line in the select method?
[16:21:35] <robertmaxrees> you said it's undefined, right?
[16:22:44] <jakesyl> nothing now
[16:22:52] <jakesyl> and the enter thing doesn't work either
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> looks like your return format is broken.
[16:23:58] <jakesyl> it's valid json... how does it expect me to return it
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's debouncing.
[16:24:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused - I'm not seeing any console logs in there.
[16:24:31] <robertmaxrees> on https://latingenerator-jakesyl1.c9.io/
[16:25:13] <jakesyl> line 26
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a custom log function.  actually use console.log()
[16:26:02] <jakesyl> this is what I'm seeing: https://gist.github.com/jakesyl/99f6367e9be282038ce1
[16:26:15] <jakesyl> I'm using console.log() on line  27
[16:26:36] <jakesyl> that's console.log, right?
[16:27:39] <robertmaxrees> slow down - is the issue that the select callback isn't working correctly, or that you're not able to see data at all?
[16:29:06] <robertmaxrees> because the reason you're not seeing data is because you're not returning things in the format it's expecting - should literally just be an array of objects with "label" and "value" props.
[16:30:31] <jakesyl> so this one... http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[16:30:58] <robertmaxrees> read the section under "String" - specifically the last sentence.
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> you have two choices for data format.
[16:32:52] <jakesyl> so, can we try this one...

[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> -b *!*@2601:8a:403:2dff:80fd:c3e7:b0c8:3427
[16:35:27] <robertmaxrees> whoops
[16:35:51] <robertmaxrees> the issue is not with your js.
[16:35:56] <robertmaxrees> it's with the data format of the return.
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> the thing you needed to read was "The data itself can be in the same format as the local data described above."
[16:36:30] <jakesyl_mobile> yeah, so what should I return for it to be valid, just ["string1", "string2"]?
[16:36:47] <robertmaxrees> look at the two formats above.
[16:36:51] <robertmaxrees> either one of those works.
[16:39:30] <jakesyl_mobile> does it have to return var ui= []
[16:39:34] <jakesyl_mobile> or just []
[16:39:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't know where you got the ui from.
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> like, the docs are pretty clear about what you need :)
[16:44:27] <jakesyl_mobile> got it
[16:49:04] <robertmaxrees> got it figured out?
[17:09:38] <jakesyl_mobile> yep!
[17:13:28] <Vanquish349> Hey, I am having this annoying issue where my scripts are acting weirdly on ios devices
[17:14:05] <Vanquish349> And is very hard to debug because of the lack of developer console
[17:14:05] <robertmaxrees> "weirdly", eh?
[17:14:12] <robertmaxrees> are you on a mac?
[17:14:18] <Vanquish349> no
[17:14:24] <Vanquish349> The first lines work fine
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing an example?
[17:14:33] <Vanquish349> the last work fine
[17:14:48] <Vanquish349> and the middle is just completly broken
[17:15:36] <Vanquish349> Let me throw up some code on pastebin
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> pastebin needs to die.
[17:16:50] <snover> so much for pacifism!
[17:16:56] <robertmaxrees> hurr
[17:16:56] <taplar_> i'm waiting for the pun
[17:17:59] <Vanquish349> http://pastebin.com/j263ew7j
[17:18:18] <Vanquish349> It is just ran on page with a bunch of selects and inputs
[17:18:29] <robertmaxrees> so what about this doesn't work?
[17:18:48] <Vanquish349> on mobile, only the first .val gets set
[17:18:54] <Vanquish349> well not mobile
[17:18:57] <Vanquish349> just IOS
[17:19:08] <Vanquish349> android and windows phone work fine
[17:19:23] <taplar_> hmm
[17:19:28] <robertmaxrees> something smells here.
[17:19:33] <taplar_> 'booToString' .... returns a number?
[17:19:46] <taplar_> :s
[17:19:47] <robertmaxrees> and that's not returning a string.
[17:19:54] <robertmaxrees> why are you coercing like that?
[17:19:55] <Vanquish349> Yeah....
[17:20:11] <robertmaxrees> var Extras = ((LM * 5.5 * BoardMovementUnit) * CheckBoard + (ShadeClothUnit * 3.5) * CheckShade + (RootProtUnit * 9) * CheckRoof); O.o
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> so what's something that's not working here?
[17:20:45] <Vanquish349> well pretty much anything down from like 48
[17:20:48] <Vanquish349> line*
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> so HireBoardPrice and below?
[17:21:23] <taplar_> oh
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> err, $('input[name=LabourCost').val((labour*SQM).toFixed(2)); rather
[17:21:26] <taplar_> parse error
[17:21:45] <taplar_> or just error ^
[17:21:49] <Vanquish349> yeah
[17:21:52] <Vanquish349> taplar_: ?
[17:21:57] <taplar_> missing the closing ]
[17:22:31] <Vanquish349> well i am an idiot
[17:22:55] <Vanquish349> let me just check to see if that works
[17:23:16] <taplar_> also, since it looks like your doing -a lot- of selects off of differently named inputs, it might be beneficial if you got them all and just filtered off of it later
[17:24:01] <Vanquish349> taplar_: sorry, Could you elaborate?
[17:24:27] <taplar_> var $inputs = $('input');  $inputs.filter('[name="whateveryouneed"]');
[17:24:54] <taplar_> repeated filters rather than lookups
[17:25:18] <Vanquish349> let me do a read up on .filter
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, $('input[name=SquareMetre]') is not a good thing to do.
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> also - what's with that boolToString function?>
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you coercing the type around like that?
[17:29:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just use the bool that gets returned?
[17:29:54] <Vanquish349> robertmaxrees: well i needed to get the value on a checkbox, and i felt like easiest way of checking to see if it was checked was just multiplying it with the required number, so it if it wasn't checked it the results number would equal 0
[17:30:11] <robertmaxrees> abstract that part out instead.
[17:30:21] <robertmaxrees> because you're coercing false to a falsy value.
[17:30:23] <taplar_> at the least fix the function name
[17:30:34] <Vanquish349> yeah, the function name was wrong
[17:30:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ if you don't want to just use the bool, change the function name.
[17:30:49] <robertmaxrees> but do some conditionals instead.
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> plus, if (booToString($('input[type=checkbox][name=Extras\\[' + loop + '\\]\\[ExtrasInclude\\]]').prop("checked"))) { - literally don't need the method there.
[17:31:12] <robertmaxrees> *function
[17:31:36] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that entire $(".multiplier-contents").each(function(i) { could be replaced by a .map() with a .join()
[17:32:10] <Vanquish349> so lots of work to do :)
[17:32:13] <robertmaxrees> and you have that conditional that starts with if (i > 4) { - that's a little heavy handed.
[17:32:22] <robertmaxrees> you're basically hiding/showing unnecessarily.
[17:33:08] <robertmaxrees> and finally, the 4 event listeners before the .keydown() can all be combined.
[17:33:30] <Vanquish349> yep
[17:33:30] <taplar_> i was going to ask about those events
[17:33:37] <taplar_> do the elements belong to a form?
[17:33:45] <Vanquish349> yep
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form then.
[17:33:52] <taplar_> try delegate binding on the form
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> and don't wrap the callback in an anonymous function.
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> literally can just do $(document).on("change click", 'input, select, .multiplier-add-button, .multiplier-remove-button', updateDoc); instead.
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, target the form instead of $(document)
[17:36:26] <taplar_> did we mention ln 131 is unnecessary?
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> sprt pf
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> *sort of
[17:38:25] <Vanquish349> Just the return false?
[17:38:39] <robertmaxrees> missing the .stopPropagation() there.
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> return false is the same as calling event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault()
[17:38:52] <Vanquish349> This is hilarious
[17:39:02] <taplar_> hmm?
[17:39:06] <robertmaxrees> tag teamin'.
[17:39:16] <Vanquish349> watching my code fucking shredded
[17:39:24] <robertmaxrees> nah, it's not getting shredded.
[17:39:26] <taplar_> oh, actually i was kinda worried we might be over loading him
[17:39:50] <robertmaxrees> just getting some feedback :)
[17:40:03] <Vanquish349> you are overloading me
[17:40:11] <Vanquish349> i have to keep going back and re reading
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> sorry about that ;)
[17:40:32] <taplar_> the logs are good for that
[17:40:35] <taplar_> imho
[17:45:30] <Vanquish349> back
[17:46:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:53:50] <taplar_> the more i look at it, this script seems kinda heavy
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> what is it actually trying to accomplish?
[17:54:26] <taplar_> i mean, one thing is going to be changing at a time right?
[17:54:36] <taplar_> but -everything- is being recalculated every time
[17:55:04] <taplar_> just seems a little odd
[17:55:11] <robertmaxrees> and reselected
[17:55:15] <taplar_> yah
[17:55:41] <Vanquish349> Yeah i reworking the whole script
[17:57:24] <taplar_> also looks like it would be  a b* to unit test
[17:58:12] <robertmaxrees> taplar_ hahaha slow down there ;)
[17:58:23] <taplar_> i know i know
[17:58:39] <robertmaxrees> and JS is a pain to unit test in general.
[17:58:43] <robertmaxrees> it's gotten better, but still funky.
[17:58:54] <Vanquish349> would it be better to put a handler on every input
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> well, not necessarily.
[17:59:35] <robertmaxrees> a single delegated listener is your best bet, but abstracting out all of that selecting and calculating would be nice.
[17:59:40] <robertmaxrees> especially the selecting.
[17:59:55] <Vanquish349> How would i do that?
[18:00:23] <robertmaxrees> store them in variables.
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> doing $() is kind of expensive.  doing $() with attribute selectors is really expensive.
[18:00:50] <robertmaxrees> so reducing the number of times you do them is really valuable.
[18:02:10] <Vanquish349> So as taplar_  said and use .filter on saved object?
[18:03:27] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:03:31] <robertmaxrees> well, kind of.
[18:03:32] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:03:44] <taplar_> start with that and go more granular if you want
[18:04:02] <taplar_> if you go more granular, you can use that to get those
[18:05:40] <taplar_> after all, somevariable is easier to read than $input.filter('[name="somevariable"]') over and over
[18:05:47] <Vanquish349> ok
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> var $inputs = $('input'), $name = $inputs.filter(function() { return $(this).prop('name') === 'name' });
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> etc
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> and with that, enjoy.
[18:07:34] <taplar_> just remember to store the reference, not the .val() off of it
[18:17:39] <taplar_> lol, i just noticed pastebin's public listing of most recent pastes.  found one containing some sort of game stats
[18:33:57] <marco___> Hello
[18:34:08] <taplar_> evening
[18:34:59] <taplar_> wow, i'm slipping.  missed the chance at a polo
[18:35:17] <marco___> :P
[18:35:59] <marco___> can I use data-* attribute to store text, like a sentence/description ?
[18:36:07] <taplar_> sure
[18:37:01] <marco___> ok thanks.
[20:08:09] <dshap> Hey all, one of my users is getting a “Failed to load resource: net:: ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE” in Chrome for this jQuery source hosted by Google: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[20:08:17] <dshap> while using my site
[20:08:35] <dshap> is this problem definitely on her end or could it possibly have something to do with my site?
[20:12:47] <marco___> dshap: just host it on your site :D
[20:44:04] <AliG1000> Hi - am I able to pull in external content into Bootstrap tabs?
[21:08:28] <Utils> Using jQuery UI sortable tabs, when you drag a tab, it moves the position of the others. I'm unable to see what styling causes this... An example of when the moving tab moves up is here: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#sortable but for some reason in my result, the majority of the tabs get pushed down http://jsfiddle.net/qu0L21j1/13/
[21:08:44] <Utils> either way, i'd like it so they didn't move up or down.
[21:09:01] <Utils> or at the very least, keep it like that on jquery ui instead of pushing the other tabs down.
[23:19:55] <Cork> Utils: http://jsfiddle.net/qu0L21j1/18/
[23:29:58] <Kartagis> good morning. Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain: could this be why my jquery refuses to work on the phone?
[23:30:15] <Cork> Kartagis: no, not jquery
[23:30:27] <Cork> but some browsers doesn't take it as javascript
[23:30:32] <Cork> (gecko for example)
[23:30:52] <Cork> so yes, you should set the correct content-type for your resources
[23:31:54] <Kartagis> Cork: I mean phonegap app, not browser
[23:32:07] <Cork> Kartagis: phonegap is a browser
[23:32:15] <Cork> it is just a browser without any ui
[23:32:22] <Cork> i think it uses webkit, but not sure
[23:33:26] <Utils> what did you change cork? i did it myself by adding .ui-sortable-helper { bottom: 0 !important; top: auto !important; }
[23:33:32] <Utils> but i see you didnt' do it that way
[23:33:40] <Kartagis> holy crap
[23:34:07] <Cork> Utils: i fixed the vertical-align value for the placeholder
[23:34:19] <Cork> (see the first line in the css section)
[23:34:32] <Utils> ooo
[23:34:38] <Kartagis> I replaced document.addEventListener("deviceready", function() { with $(function() { and it worked
[23:45:20] <hackel> How can I set up an event handler to trigger on both document.ready someelement.change? Would I just have to do it twice?
[23:45:39] <Cork> hackel: use a named function
[23:47:17] <compact> hi guys. I've got google maps on my tablet (web based on my website). how can i make it so if somebody holds on the screen on the map, it drops a marker
[23:47:54] <hackel> Cork: Yeah, that's what I meant by doing it twice instead of a single anonymous function.
[23:48:04] <Cork> compact: the google api has a click handler you can use
[23:48:16] <compact> will that work for tablets too?
[23:48:26] <Cork> hackel: that isn't twice...
[23:48:50] <Cork> compact: yes click events are fired by clicking the screen on a touch device
[23:49:12] <Cork> else normal webpages would break badly on a touch device
[23:52:31] <Kartagis> heh, replacing document.addEventListener("deviceready", function() { with $(function() { solved not just 1, but 2 of my issue
