[00:00:54] <slowslw> sahbeewah: every? I though i replacing only in one div
[00:02:20] <slowslw> thought*
[00:02:33] <sahbeewah> i'd help, but i have no clue what you're trying to do
[00:02:38] <sahbeewah> firstly, jquery has a .clone method
[00:03:25] <sahbeewah> by using .replace on a selector, jquery searches everything including attributes and replaces them
[00:04:29] <sahbeewah> since your textarea has a cols/rows attribute, by the 5th click the row and column has a value with a number containing 13^5 digits = 371293
[00:04:58] <slowslw> sahbeewah: i'm tryng to add form dynamically add forms for file uploading(there are digits in id
[00:05:03] <slowslw> 's)
[00:05:40] <slowslw> so i have to replace them with some other digits to make forms work with rails
[00:07:58] <slowslw> sahbeewah: nah, it's doesn't matter
[00:08:02] <slowslw> re text area
[00:08:07] <sahbeewah> i don't see the id
[00:08:11] <sahbeewah> with numbers
[00:08:31] <slowslw> sahbeewah: ok, wait a second, i repaste it
[00:09:48] <slowslw> sahbeewah: http://jsbin.com/efosum/5/edit
[00:10:52] <slowslw> sahbeewah: so you think the problem is in replace()?
[00:11:46] <Justin0908> Does anyone know why my Adult2 "children" don't show up as buttons? http://jsfiddle.net/2bhZH/
[00:13:56] <sahbeewah> slowslw, you need to redesign that... you're not going to be able to maintain it
[00:14:12] <sahbeewah> the core reason that previous code didn't work was because of the wrong regex in the .replace
[00:14:46] <sahbeewah> but you shouldn't be converting the html elements into a string, and searching for numbers in the first place
[00:17:14] <slowslw> sahbeewah: oh, yes, thanks, fixed regex and now it's fine
[00:18:18] <sahbeewah> sure.. but you should probably invest some time and refactor it using .clone(), .data(), and just general... dom manipulation
[00:18:30] <sahbeewah> rather than string manipulation, which defies the purpose of jquery
[00:20:08] <sahbeewah> Justin0908, you have a duplicated id "format" which isn't valid html
[00:20:27] <slowslw> sahbeewah: you can't get complete tag with jquery(by complete i mean with outer tag, only insides, people do crazy things to fix it http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/ )
[00:20:39] <sahbeewah> when you run the .buttonset() on the #format selector, it'll only apply it to the first one, which works under the assumption that there is only one id
[00:20:47] <sahbeewah> or so it should work under that assumption anyway....
[00:21:05] <slowslw> and even after getting complete tag you need to fix numbers somehow
[00:21:48] <slowslw> not only insides*
[00:22:38] <Justin0908> So no simple fix...hmm.
[00:23:05] <sahbeewah> slowslw, don't see how that's relevant... you can adjust the html for that, or just work with the clone() like i mentioned
[00:23:50] <sahbeewah> Justin0908, the "simple" fix is to replace the id="format" to class="format" and change your selector from "#format" to ".format"
[00:24:19] <slowslw> sahbeewah: ok, i should think about, just can't came up with complete soluton right now
[00:26:47] <Justin0908> sahbeewah - thank you - I'm going to mess with it now.
[00:28:22] <Justin0908> shit, that was simple. thanks again! cheers!
[01:13:37] <prefix> hey, how would I display the result of this lookup? var lastPlayer = $('.content').last('.jplayer').not('#navbar-player');
[01:13:46] <prefix> console.log(lastPlayer)?
[01:39:42] <beaky> hello
[01:40:49] <beaky> is jquery like a library for js?
[01:42:32] <beaky> seems it's like a js api for the DOM
[01:45:17] <beaky> why is it so popular?
[02:15:18] <sacrilicious> guys, sit around the fire as i tell you the tale of the ugliest hack i've ever done in my history as a developer
[02:15:38] <sacrilicious> so aparently, in facebook, when you create your app, your links should be all in https
[02:15:47] <sacrilicious> but our website does not use https
[02:16:15] <beaky> ah
[02:16:18] <beaky> why not?
[02:16:26] <sacrilicious> so one ugly hack i've found was to redirect our users to my dropbox folder and access a file there
[02:16:39] <beaky> hah
[02:16:51] <sacrilicious> that file in dropbox has a window.location script that will redirect the users back to our facebook app
[02:17:01] <sacrilicious> now they all can register with the website
[02:17:24] <sacrilicious> this is one ugly hack that i am not proud of
[02:17:47] <beaky> lol im gunna report u to teh fb police  for hacking!11
[02:18:08] <sacrilicious> lolz, its not hacking, its bypassing the rulz :P
[02:18:25] <beaky> just kidding ^^ that is an interesting hack though
[02:18:44] <sacrilicious> indeed, how many years have you been in coding beaky ?
[02:19:27] <beaky> only a year :(
[02:19:48] <sacrilicious> no wonder you are amazed by it :P the others would scream at me
[02:32:59] <abhisheikh> hi sawrubh
[02:33:48] <abhisheikh> hi sawrubh
[02:33:56] <abhisheikh> i need help
[02:35:21] <abhisheikh> hi
[02:35:46] <abhisheikh> hi
[03:22:55] <t432> how do you test for the following unicode &#160; .. null seems not to work
[03:30:27] <ChrisBolton> Can somebody help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? http://pastie.org/5672785
[03:30:45] <ChrisBolton> I get a TypeError: text is undefined
[03:30:58] <ChrisBolton> var match=text.toUpperCase().indexOf(term.toUpperCase()),
[03:31:46] <AlbinoGeek> Should be a rather trivial problem, but I can't say I'm very versed in JavaScript, I'm at the point where I've caught an onClick for a checkbox, verified that it's been checked, and in a loop for each input field in the source form.  I need to copy all values from the source form to the destination form at this point, the IDs of the sourceForm being BillingForm[inputnamehere]
[03:31:54] <AlbinoGeek> The destination element's names being ShippingForm[inputnamehere]
[03:33:07] <t432> anyone spot anything wrong with this line? var test = $('#foo').val();if(test == null || test == "&nbsp;"){	alert("True");}
[03:33:15] <t432> aler is no activated
[03:33:18] <t432> not*
[03:34:07] <t432> #foo input has value = "&nbsp;" in page source code
[03:34:38] <Mik-_-> when i m trying to a datepicker to a text field on my drupal site i get js error 'uncaught typeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> had no method 'replace' .. prob a stupid error but i m a beginner, so plz help :)
[03:34:59] <AlbinoGeek> t432: What does:  alert(($('#foo').val()==null)); and alert(($('#foo').val()=="&nbsp;")); say?
[03:35:16] <AlbinoGeek> (should be False, True in your case.)
[03:39:17] <t432> AlbinoGeek: strange. both false.
[03:39:49] <t432> ah i see
[03:39:53] <AlbinoGeek> t432: Then clearly "&nbsp;" in a string isn't quite the same, have you tried matching " " ?
[03:40:01] <t432> mutltiple values in element
[03:40:16] <t432> tried that also
[03:40:25] <t432> i see the problem
[03:48:23] <[jmc]> quick question
[03:48:47] <[jmc]> if I want to add a custom icon to a button, can I specify the icon file path like this?
[03:49:07] <[jmc]> $("#button").button({ icons: { primary: "../images/lol.png" } })
[04:02:24] <ChrisBolton> Anyone familiar with the select2 library?
[04:05:30] <BinaryKitten> only just.. came across it yesterday
[04:06:32] <ChrisBolton> I'm trying to implement their infinite scroll with remote data but I'm getting TypeError: text is undefined
[04:06:46] <BinaryKitten> jsfiddle?
[04:06:55] <ChrisBolton> 	
[04:06:56] <ChrisBolton> var match=text.toUpperCase().indexOf(term.toUpperCase()),
[04:06:56] <ChrisBolton> select2.js?body=1 (line 255)
[04:07:03] <BinaryKitten> please don't paste to channel
[04:07:14] <BinaryKitten> please use jsfiddle and link the right resources
[04:07:16] <ChrisBolton> I have it in pastie
[04:07:24] <BinaryKitten> pastie will do
[04:07:46] <ChrisBolton> http://pastie.org/5672785
[04:08:04] <BinaryKitten> line 3
[04:08:13] <BinaryKitten> you're missing ({
[04:08:32] <ChrisBolton> It's CoffeeScript.
[04:08:41] <BinaryKitten> can you give us the js output
[04:08:52] <BinaryKitten> i can't mentally convert
[04:08:55] <ChrisBolton> Yeah, hold please.
[04:10:12] <ChrisBolton> http://pastie.org/5673578
[04:12:24] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[04:12:38] <BinaryKitten> don't see anything wrong with that
[04:12:52] <BinaryKitten> do see something wrong with api.rottentomatoes.com though
[04:13:02] <BinaryKitten> 30 lines of whitespace = bad json
[04:13:09] <ChrisBolton> Seriously.
[04:13:41] <BinaryKitten> yep
[04:13:55] <BinaryKitten> just looking at the select2
[04:14:02] <BinaryKitten> to see the line and what triggers is
[04:14:04] <BinaryKitten> *it
[04:14:34] <ChrisBolton> The error that's triggered appears to come from select2.js line 255.
[04:14:45] <BinaryKitten> right
[04:18:02] <helpneeded_> I am having some trouble using formatItem http://pastebin.com/PGr91a1c
[04:19:54] <BinaryKitten> ChrisBolton have you tried a different data source?
[04:20:57] <ChrisBolton> I have not. It would seem odd to me for the rotten tomatoes api to not work seeing as how that's the example they use on the select2 demo site. And it works.
[04:23:09] <ChrisBolton> I wonder if it has something to do with the form I'm tagging it to.
[04:23:30] <BinaryKitten> maybe but it seems that the issue is triggered in the processing
[04:24:13] <ChrisBolton> I thought the same.
[04:24:54] <ChrisBolton> Yeah I changed it to a simple form and it's throwing the same error.
[04:25:37] <ChrisBolton> When you test it are you getting the same error?
[04:28:56] * BinaryKitten hasn't tested
[04:29:44] <ChrisBolton> Well I appreciate your help. I'll keep plugging away at it.
[04:29:55] <BinaryKitten> try it out on jsfiddle
[04:30:05] <ChrisBolton> Let me know if you happen upon anything brilliant.
[04:32:03] <ChrisBolton> http://jsfiddle.net/9Quvy/
[04:33:00] <BinaryKitten> urm
[04:34:10] <BinaryKitten> ChrisBolton isn't it meant to replace a select?
[04:38:47] <BinaryKitten> ChrisBolton there are a couple of js errors
[04:38:52] <helpneeded_> BinaryKitten do you have a second to look athis, thank you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14292794/using-jquery-event-handler-with-autocomplete-to-set-page-id-to-var
[04:39:24] <BinaryKitten> helpneeded_ no sorry at the moment helping ChrisBolton
[04:39:39] <helpneeded_> ok
[04:40:37] <Gavrisimo> is there separate channel for jquery plugin development or is this one for those purposes also?
[04:40:51] <BinaryKitten> Gavrisimo this one is for all
[04:41:00] <Gavrisimo> one channel to bind them all
[04:41:01] <Gavrisimo> ok
[04:41:02] <Gavrisimo> :)
[04:41:36] <BinaryKitten> and in the face of IE bind them (to an event)
[04:45:52] <Whirl3d> Good morning. In jqueryUI sortable, is there a way to constrain the elements so they only drag up and down?
[04:49:46] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d ? http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-containment
[04:50:07] <Gavrisimo> hehe... I am sort of working on one plugin, really simple one, it's like a wrapper for toggling visibility of elements and in that process I am also learining about jq plugin development. I was wandering if someone might take a look: https://github.com/Gavrisimo/toggler/blob/master/src/toggler.js
[04:50:31] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, thanks. Where did you get that. I have been looking for this documentation on the new jquery UI pages and didn't see it.
[04:50:58] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/
[04:51:04] <BinaryKitten> then saw "conatinment"
[04:51:39] <Whirl3d> aha. I was just a http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[04:51:52] <Whirl3d> I appreciate it.
[04:52:06] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d np
[04:52:17] <BinaryKitten> Gavrisimo that does seem massive
[04:52:27] <Gavrisimo> agree
[04:52:44] <BinaryKitten> i got lost about line 40
[04:52:52] <Gavrisimo> I want to learn about jq plugin dev with this
[04:53:29] <Gavrisimo> maybe read first what I am trying to do here https://github.com/Gavrisimo/toggler and see demo :)
[04:54:31] <BinaryKitten> so what does toggler offer that .toggle() doesn't ?
[04:55:12] <Gavrisimo> so far I have .toggle(), animate() and fadeToggle() under toggler()
[04:55:31] <BinaryKitten> right .. but what does it offer that .toggle doesn't?
[04:55:42] <Gavrisimo> toggle() for simple toggling, animate() for smooth animation without jerking, and fade
[04:55:50] <Gavrisimo> nothing
[04:55:55] <Gavrisimo> it's just calling toggle()
[04:56:08] <BinaryKitten> ok
[04:56:09] <Gavrisimo> if you pass type:'simple'
[04:56:23] <BinaryKitten> i'm confused as to the benefit this would have...
[04:56:24] <Gavrisimo> if you pass type:'smooth' it's using animate()
[04:56:40] <Gavrisimo> if you pass type:'fade' it is using fadeToggle()
[04:57:08] <Gavrisimo> don't worry about the benefits... :) they might be non existing
[04:57:18] <Gavrisimo> I am just trying to writte something
[04:57:30] <Gavrisimo> to get started with jq plugin dev
[04:57:53] <Gavrisimo> I might be the only one who will benefit from this one... hehe :)
[05:00:42] <BinaryKitten> Gavrisimo: simple...
[05:00:43] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/4BZd2/
[05:04:43] <Gavrisimo> BinaryKitten yup, I know, I am just trying to start with jq plugin dev with some simple concepts... :)
[05:04:53] <BinaryKitten> cool
[05:05:00] <BinaryKitten> i'm working on an update to that
[05:05:09] <BinaryKitten> that was shown as the simplest version
[05:09:51] <BinaryKitten> Gavrisimo an update taking options
[05:09:52] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/4BZd2/2/
[05:13:09] <BinaryKitten> does that make sense?
[05:14:38] <Gavrisimo> yes
[05:14:47] <Gavrisimo> thanks for the effort
[05:15:05] <BinaryKitten> anything you want me to show/explain?
[05:15:33] <Gavrisimo> have you checked demo page?
[05:16:33] <BinaryKitten> where is tht
[05:16:53] <Gavrisimo> ah, you have to download zip from github page
[05:17:00] <Gavrisimo> forgot about that
[05:17:02] <BinaryKitten> ah right
[05:17:11] <BinaryKitten> you know about gh-pages ?
[05:17:14] <Gavrisimo> yup
[05:17:24] <BinaryKitten> best to create one of those for the demo
[05:17:30] <Gavrisimo> i started this ~16h ago :)
[05:17:48] <Gavrisimo> ye ye, I just didn't get the time to put it in gh-pages
[05:17:55] <BinaryKitten> heh
[05:18:42] <Gavrisimo> I wanted a wrapper for all sorts of "toggle visibility" methods
[05:18:54] <Gavrisimo> toggle() is simpliest of them
[05:18:56] <BinaryKitten> i understand
[05:19:02] <Gavrisimo> if you check "type: smooth; speed: 1000; noJerky: false;" on demo page
[05:19:04] <Gavrisimo> and the one below
[05:19:09] <BinaryKitten> just seems that wrapper is overkill
[05:19:11] <Gavrisimo> I am using animate() on that one
[05:19:29] <Gavrisimo> so there is no jerky animation
[05:19:38] <Gavrisimo> cause by margin/padding
[05:19:43] <Gavrisimo> caused*
[05:19:47] <BinaryKitten> right i get that
[05:20:33] <Gavrisimo> also slideToggle() is not animating same as when you .animate({height: 0})
[05:20:39] <BinaryKitten> gah
[05:20:56] <BinaryKitten> ok we get it. You feel you've made something better
[05:21:26] <BinaryKitten> what is you would like us to do?
[05:22:12] <Gavrisimo> hehe
[05:22:54] <Gavrisimo> just look at the code and see if I am doing something terribly wrong(except doing an overkill) :)
[05:23:20] <BinaryKitten> that's my point. Because of the overkill, i get lost in the code
[05:23:31] <BinaryKitten> especially for something that is relatively so simple
[05:23:36] <Gavrisimo> I don't feel I've made something better, I feel I have learned a thing or two about jq plugin dev
[05:24:07] <Gavrisimo> I could have also used some other simple thing, like wrapper for css()
[05:25:07] * BinaryKitten isn't a big fan of wrappers
[05:25:22] <BinaryKitten> anyway
[05:25:25] <Gavrisimo> I would love that I get the idea for uber super jq plugin, but until then I have to do stuff like this to learn how to make one
[05:28:18] <BinaryKitten> ok .. well good luck
[05:28:22] <BinaryKitten> i have to go now
[05:28:45] <Gavrisimo> cheers
[05:28:46] <Gavrisimo> :)
[05:40:56] <needinghelp> I am trying to sent the result with the value of ID to a hidden form called "IDTAG" what am I doing wrong

[05:41:34] <Gavrisimo> !help
[05:42:19] <cusco> hi
[05:51:37] <needinghelp> I am trying to use a handler to send  data with the value of "ID" to a hidden form called "IDTAG" does anyone know what I am doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/63673Qrs
[05:52:55] <BinaryKitten> is the form element name that or the id?
[05:53:45] <needinghelp> The array is returning ID, name, date.
[05:54:05] <needinghelp> I want to send ID to a hidden form called "IDTAG" and not be displayed in autocomplete
[05:54:09] <BinaryKitten> the element
[05:54:28] <BinaryKitten> the one you're trying to put hte value in
[05:55:00] <BinaryKitten> does it have    name="IDTAG" or id="IDTAG" ?
[05:55:00] <needinghelp> Binary Kitten this is what works
[05:55:03] <needinghelp> 	jQuery(document).ready(function(){ 			$('#ticksearch').autocomplete({source:'suggest_zip.php', minLength:2}); 		});
[05:55:14] <BinaryKitten> that's not what i asked
[05:55:22] <needinghelp> , but I am trying to use a handler to send "ID" to a hidden form
[05:55:30] <BinaryKitten> i get that
[05:55:37] <BinaryKitten> please can you answer the question though
[05:56:06] <BinaryKitten> the element you're trying to put hte value in does it have    name="IDTAG" or id="IDTAG" ?
[05:56:34] <needinghelp> erm whatever you want me to do
[05:56:45] <needinghelp> the form has an id="IDTAG"
[05:56:49] <BinaryKitten> form
[05:56:53] <BinaryKitten> or input?
[05:56:59] <BinaryKitten> form has no value
[05:57:07] <needinghelp> its ha "hidden" form
[05:57:14] <BinaryKitten> hidden form?
[05:57:18] <needinghelp> basically I want to carry along the mnysql row ID
[05:57:25] <BinaryKitten> still has no value
[05:57:33] <BinaryKitten> inputs have values, inputs sit in forms
[05:57:58] <BinaryKitten> inputs are input tags, select tags and textarea tags
[05:58:11] <needinghelp> <input id="IDTAG" type="hidden" />
[05:58:21] <BinaryKitten> right
[05:58:22] <BinaryKitten> ok
[05:58:26] <BinaryKitten> so now the data
[05:58:42] <BinaryKitten> you said it returns ID, name and date
[05:58:50] <BinaryKitten> is the ID .. "ID" or "id"
[05:59:05] <needinghelp> the mysl column is called ID
[05:59:19] <BinaryKitten> and the one you get back from the ajax?
[05:59:42] <needinghelp> ID
[05:59:46] <BinaryKitten> ok
[05:59:56] <BinaryKitten> so item.id isn't going to work
[06:00:01] <BinaryKitten> can you see why?
[06:00:02] <needinghelp> case sensitive
[06:00:07] <BinaryKitten> yep
[06:03:02] <tiphares> what is it i'm actually doing when i'm doing "$.on(...."
[06:03:29] <BinaryKitten> $.on?
[06:03:31] <BinaryKitten> nothing
[06:03:37] <tiphares> well using the "$"
[06:03:44] <tiphares> alone
[06:03:49] <needinghelp> still not working though BinaryKitten http://pastebin.com/wjZcrwTG
[06:03:51] <BinaryKitten> $ is an alias for jQuery
[06:04:16] <BinaryKitten> needinghelp you need to sort out a few things
[06:04:23] <BinaryKitten> like the sql injection too
[06:04:54] <BinaryKitten> suggest_zip?term='; drop table alltickets
[06:04:56] <needinghelp> but the autocomplete query does work if I remove the result function
[06:06:10] <tiphares> BinaryKitten well now that you say it, it seems obvious. thanks!
[06:06:48] * BinaryKitten has to go sort out the incredible amount of pain she's in
[06:06:55] <BinaryKitten> sorry i can't be more help

[06:23:40] <masentinel900> I'm running an ajax jquery function in my document, I have activated the web console and when I click for to run the function, It show me $ajax is not defined.
[06:23:50] <masentinel900> Somebody can help me with that ?
[06:24:51] <adavia_> masentinel900:  i guess ur function is misspelled os something like that
[06:24:57] <adavia_> as is not finding the function
[06:25:56] <adavia_> masentinel900:  check if u have all the correct libraries and if you are pointing correctly
[06:27:29] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: can I show you the script?
[06:29:59] <adavia_> masentinel900:  ok
[06:30:18] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/BU7TM/
[06:30:18] <BinaryKitten> $ajax?
[06:30:28] <masentinel900> That is my code!!
[06:30:31] <masentinel900> is ajax
[06:30:41] <BinaryKitten> $ajax change to $.ajax
[06:30:45] <BinaryKitten> the . is important
[06:30:59] <adavia_> yes
[06:31:04] <adavia_> BinaryKitten: is right
[06:31:11] <BinaryKitten> (sorry to butt in there adavia_)
[06:31:55] <adavia_> like i told you before was somethinf misspelled
[06:34:46] <masentinel900> Yes the ponit were the ajax problem..
[06:35:22] <masentinel900> But now, if my url is the modal controller, what would should happens there?
[06:37:47] <masentinel900> I put that show me the rror and tell me :: parseerror
[06:40:48] <rindolf> Hi all. How do I download the latest release of http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/345/release ? All JS is enabled.
[06:41:45] <BinaryKitten> rindolf unfortunately the archive is disabled for downloading
[06:41:56] <rindolf> BinaryKitten: oh.
[06:43:25] <needinghelp> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14292794/using-jquery-event-handler-with-autocomplete-to-set-page-id-to-var
[06:43:48] <rindolf> https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-querystring - is this more recommended?
[06:43:49] <BinaryKitten> rindolf http://blairmitchelmore.com/contact try contacting the author
[06:44:11] <BinaryKitten> rindolf there are no recommendations.
[06:44:18] <BinaryKitten> there is only what works for you
[06:45:07] <rindolf> BinaryKitten: OK.
[06:47:17] <masentinel900> <BinaryKitten>: Do you know what mean the "parse error" log
[06:47:48] <BinaryKitten> masentinel900 not without context no
[06:48:40] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/MJ6pp/
[06:48:42] <masentinel900> Is that
[06:51:57] <BinaryKitten> i still have no clue masentinel900
[06:53:31] <masentinel900> <BinaryKitten>: can you give me little example of what would happen in the url "modal" if the data is sent succesfully,
[06:54:16] <masentinel900> Is that is running ok, but really I don't know what would have that happens.
[06:54:36] <BinaryKitten> masentinel900 no clue
[06:54:51] <BinaryKitten> it looks right, but no clue as to what or what it's doing
[06:54:56] <BinaryKitten> there is very little context
[06:55:20] <adavia_> does anybody here knows why <meta content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" http-equiv=Content-Type> do not work in firefox?
[06:55:56] <bytephilia> Is there any obvious reason to why it might break the page to load jQuery right before the body tag instead of somewhere in the body?
[06:56:01] <bytephilia> right before the body close tag I mean
[06:56:13] <masentinel900> <BinaryKitten>: This function will be for to pass data from that view to "modal controller"
[06:57:41] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia yes, if there is JS on the page before it
[06:58:06] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia if there is js on the page before, you could have an error and then the code wouldn't run
[06:58:32] <bytephilia> right. non-external JS u mean?
[06:59:13] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia JS is sequential in loading
[06:59:24] <bytephilia> even the external scripts?
[06:59:29] <bytephilia> they don't load in parallel?
[06:59:29] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia if a js error happens beforehand, it will prevent subsequent loading
[06:59:38] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia no, they load in series
[07:00:02] <BinaryKitten> that#s why it's recommended to put js at the end before the </body> so tht it doesn't block the loading
[07:00:20] <bytephilia> ok
[07:00:33] <bytephilia> but should jquery be before any other script at the bottom ideally?
[07:04:07] <BinaryKitten> bytephilia yes
[07:04:22] <BinaryKitten> if you're using jQuery then you should have that close to 1st place
[07:04:31] <BinaryKitten> followed by any jquery plugins
[07:04:33] <BinaryKitten> then your code
[07:11:35] <ladislaw> How do you reset the event after invoking e.preventDefault()?
[07:11:56] <ladislaw> notice enableDefault() does not exist
[07:14:45] <ladislaw> anyone?
[07:17:13] <BinaryKitten> ladislaw you can't
[07:17:20] <BinaryKitten> what is you're trying to achieve?
[07:17:32] <ladislaw> nvm
[07:17:34] <ravenzz> in some cases you can either unbind or preventDefault() if a given condition is satisfied
[07:17:49] <ladislaw> or you can "return true"
[07:17:56] <BinaryKitten> ladislaw in those cases where i would "enableDefault"
[07:18:02] <BinaryKitten> i turn the if on it's head
[07:18:25] <BinaryKitten> eg if (condition) { enableDefault } becomes if (!condition) { e.preventDefault(); }
[07:18:27] <ravenzz> like if (firstattempt) { preventDefault } /* do something else */
[07:18:41] <ravenzz> BinaryKitten gave you a better example
[07:22:34] <masentinel900> someone can say me how can I receive the data sent through of jquey ajax in a CI controller?
[07:22:43] <masentinel900> Is I have this
[07:23:12] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/5rxhK/
[07:24:12] <ravenzz> CI controller?
[07:24:55] <adavia_> masentinel900:
[07:25:02] <adavia_> que queres hacer?
[07:34:02] <WouterDS> Anyone who has experience with the jquery ajax form plugin? (http://malsup.com/jquery/form/)
[07:34:21] <WouterDS> For some reason it won't work online, works perfectly on my localhost but not online.
[07:34:24] <WouterDS> http://shots.wouterds.be/ScreenFlow-NuAjF9maWz.mov
[07:35:43] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: Gracias mira necesito enviar datos desde una vista hasta un controlador para trabajarlos allí
[07:37:42] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: http://jsfiddle.net/czjLB/
[07:37:50] <masentinel900> Es ese el codigo AJAX
[07:43:24] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: lo ves?
[07:46:10] <rindolf> OK, this github .querystring plugin works nicely.
[07:46:52] <adavia_> masentinel900:  datos de un formulario?
[07:48:25] <bytephilia> For scripts that affect the layout of the page, do you still recommend putting them in the bottom of the page, even though it means that the user will see a distorted version of the site for 0.5 seconds (just before the page finishes loading)
[07:50:32] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: Mira tengo una tabla que contiene los nombres de unas tareas, Cuando la selecciono y le doy click a un boton que dice viualizar necesito ver toda en la informacion relacionada con esa atrea
[07:51:17] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: Para eso necesito pasar desde la vista el id de la tarea para poder tenerla en el controlador y cargar la informacion a la vista
[07:54:28] <adavia_> mm
[07:54:57] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: entiendes lo que quiero hacer?
[07:55:36] <adavia_> o sea tenes los datos en html puro
[07:56:15] <prefix> hey, how would I display the result of this lookup? var lastPlayer = $('.content').last('.jplayer').not('#navbar-player');
[07:56:17] <prefix> console.log(lastPlayer)?
[07:57:04] <adavia_> masentinel900:  nunca lo use pero tal vez si serializas los datos con html.serialize
[07:58:12] <adavia_> deberia dejarte enviar los datos
[07:59:23] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: ven pero una cosa, es que ajax con jquery es nuevo para mi.. y tengo una pregunta
[07:59:42] <masentinel900> <adavia_>: si envio los datos al controlador.. desde el controlador como puedo recibir los datos..

[08:24:49] <eugenmayer> $content is just html in jq context. My question: modifiying $widget uing .append does mondify $content, right?

[08:32:05] <eugenmayer> ask?
[08:32:10] <eugenmayer> Never ask to ask, just ask
[08:33:06] <Mik-_-> when i m trying to a datepicker to a text field on my drupal site i get js error 'uncaught typeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> had no method 'replace' .. prob a stupid error but i m a beginner, so plz help :)
[08:33:06] <masentinel900> In my view I have a table which shows a list with somes names of tasks. If I select the name I would should to show the description of that task.
[08:33:28] <masentinel900> For that I need to send the id of the task from my view to controller..
[08:33:30] <eugenmayer> check qtip
[08:33:45] <masentinel900> I'm using an AJAX funtion with jquery
[08:33:49] <eugenmayer> that is no jquery question :)
[08:34:00] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/wkCgz/
[08:34:12] <masentinel900> Is my jquery AJAX script.
[08:34:35] <ladislaw> BinaryKitten: Form submits even when var hasError == true.... http://pastebin.com/MfJR0ANP
[08:34:52] <ladislaw> any ideas?
[08:35:02] <eugenmayer> masentinel900: i dont think the data object you use is what you want
[08:35:10] <eugenmayer> it needs to be a hash / object, not a string
[08:35:25] <masentinel900> But first I'm doing with that string for test it
[08:35:52] <masentinel900> But really the data that I need to pass is the value of an input
[08:36:04] <masentinel900> that value have the id of the task
[08:36:11] <ladislaw>  Form submits even when var hasError == true.... http://pastebin.com/MfJR0ANP
[08:36:19] <ladislaw> for all
[08:37:11] <eugenmayer> masentinel900: you have serious issues understanding the way jq.post is used. Please check a tutorial. You dont have a concrete question but rather like "how to jq.post"
[08:37:14] <eugenmayer> post?
[08:37:28] <eugenmayer> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:37:40] <eugenmayer> check the examples
[08:39:19] <masentinel900> <eugenmayer>: So, I would need to use post instead ajax function.
[08:39:20] <masentinel900> ?
[08:39:36] <eugenmayer> no, you can use both. Check the documentation for .ajax
[08:39:56] <eugenmayer> post is a wrapper arround ajax to simplify the usage
[08:40:28] <masentinel900> <eugenmayer>: But still I have a question, we suppose that the sent was sucessfull. now I how receive the data in my controller?
[08:40:52] <eugenmayer> sorry, this is not a jq question at all.
[08:46:33] <ladislaw> anyone?
[08:47:06] <sv_in> o_O
[08:59:26] <eugenmayer> is it know that the IE possible removes quotes arround classes when creating jq inline? like $widget.append( $("<span></span>").addClass("END_OF_WIDGET") );
[08:59:59] <eugenmayer> what happens in the IE is, the span container is <SPAN CLASS=END_OF_WIDGET> ..so without quotes
[09:00:23] <rindolf> eugenmayer: how do you see that?
[09:00:31] <rindolf> eugenmayer: maybe it is MSHTML... :-(
[09:01:41] <Cronoh> eugenmayer does that create a problem in the rendering? Or does it recognize the classes
[09:02:08] <eugenmayer> rindolf: well, i modify a string which is basically .html() from a wysiwyg editor. I need to append this span for specific function. My issue later is, in the backend i check for this span container, but yes, i use regexp with quotes
[09:02:31] <rindolf> eugenmayer: ah.
[09:02:41] <rindolf> eugenmayer: regexp to parse HTML?
[09:02:44] <eugenmayer> and that, for the IE content, creates issues since it does not match. Please dont tell me that "regexp" is evil, i cant use an xml/sax parser there..so
[09:02:52] <rindolf> eugenmayer: ah.
[09:03:08] <rindolf> eugenmayer: regexp is not Evil - it's just not very suitable for parsing HTML.
[09:03:35] <Cronoh> and maybe im wrong but that sounds like a weird functinoality, parsing the HTML of a wysiwig editor to change a function based on the input
[09:03:40] <eugenmayer> i know, but since i know that HTML is/should be well formed, iam just fine
[09:04:00] <eugenmayer> Cronoh: then you simply never extended a WYSIWYG editor
[09:04:19] <Cronoh> no i havent
[09:04:31] <eugenmayer> Cronoh: but in general, those WYSIWYG editors are weired and close to useless. But yeah..customers…i guess you know that story
[09:05:08] <Cronoh> yea
[09:05:10] <eugenmayer> iam just wondering about that weired behovior in IE..but maybe "wondering about IE" is the issue here :)
[09:05:20] <eugenmayer> i should have rather expected it :)
[09:05:28] <eugenmayer> http://jsfiddle.net/H9PqU/2/
[09:05:33] <eugenmayer> its all about this snippet
[09:05:34] <Cronoh> my approach might be, if regexp isnt working, to take and parse the document as DOM and then search thru it
[09:05:45] <Cronoh> might fix those kind of inconsistencies
[09:05:54] <eugenmayer> i cant, pitty, use a sax/dom parser in that context
[09:07:05] <Cronoh> $widget.find('span.END_OF_WIDGET').length
[09:07:11] <Cronoh> and so its not matching that selector right
[09:07:18] <eugenmayer> nono
[09:07:26] <Cronoh> the appended line afterwords shows up wrong
[09:07:39] <eugenmayer> that is not that issue, thats working. On dettach i add those spans to all widgets..then its saved into the backend
[09:08:46] <Cronoh> $widget.append($(document.createElement('span')).addClass('END_OF_WIDGET'));
[09:08:51] <eugenmayer> (to all widgets yet dont have a class). The issue with IE is, the XHTML saved into the backend does inlcude those spans, but the class=END_OF_WIDGET misses quotes, , so my regexp in the backend works wrong)
[09:08:52] <Cronoh> i assume that method makes no difference?
[09:09:25] <eugenmayer> should it? normally $('<span></span>') is just he same
[09:09:59] <Cronoh> honestly not sure i was jsut attempting to create the element then attach the class as opposed to letting jquery figure it out, i assume they will have the same output but its worth trying i guess
[09:10:07] <Cronoh> is the case that ALL classes in IE dont use quotes?
[09:10:23] <eugenmayer> hm, good question :)
[09:11:05] <Cronoh> its also worth checking, if they appear to, that maybe they have quotes in the View Page, but no qupotes in Developer Mode's readback, it could be changing the source for dev window
[09:11:49] <eugenmayer> yeah, i looked at the source, the source does not include them (for all those spans, but for all other elemens), the rendered / parsed HTML does inlcude them..but well that is "corrected XML" in all browsers
[09:12:09] <eugenmayer> *does not include them means, does not include the quotes
[09:12:39] <Cronoh> so, any html added during initial dom load has quotes, anything added after the fact does not ?
[09:13:16] <eugenmayer> yeah
[09:13:32] <eugenmayer> it sounds weired, it is weired. But rember…internet explorer.
[09:13:53] <eugenmayer> Iam about to change my regexp..but i tried to avoid that
[09:15:47] <eugenmayer> just for my soul i will test var $widget_delimited = $("<span></span>").attr("class","END_OF_WIDGET");
[09:16:09] <eugenmayer> it sounds absolutely stupid - that is one of the best arguments it should work in the IE.
[09:16:26] <Cronoh> lol
[09:16:34] <Cronoh> gl
[09:19:42] <eugenmayer> i gave up. Changed the regexp
[09:19:56] * eugenmayer fires up a doll with a IE logo on it
[09:20:13] <eugenmayer> Thanks for holding my hand Cronoh :)

[09:56:06] <Grundell_> Hello
[09:56:46] <Grundell_> Working on getting a button to work so that on first click it shows 2 more input fields that are hidden otherwise, on click 2 two more and so on...
[09:57:10] <Grundell_> Have the first event handled need the second and third to work
[09:59:18] <grafi> have some fiddle to look at?
[10:00:06] <Grundell_> grafi working on it right now :)
[10:00:15] <grafi> kay ;)
[10:00:18] <Grundell_> have everythingo n a site :)
[10:04:29] <Grundell_> this is how it looks as of now http://jsfiddle.net/JuxNe/
[10:05:42] <greg5green> Pessimism: that bit you pasted is always going to return true
[10:06:10] <Pessimism> greg5green: Ah. How so?
[10:07:10] <rindolf> Grundell_: says it is MooTools.
[10:07:23] <greg5green> try if ($('.pagination:contains("Next")').length)
[10:07:24] <greg5green> :)
[10:07:37] <Grundell_> rindolf - MooTools ?
[10:07:48] <rindolf> Grundell_: yes, on the left.
[10:07:53] <Grundell_> sorry im really bad ad this how do i do this ?
[10:07:57] <rindolf> Grundell_: in the framework drop down.
[10:08:06] <grafi> left hand of the window
[10:08:12] <Grundell_> okay got ir
[10:08:14] <rindolf> Grundell_: well, you need to use jQuery instead of MooTools.
[10:08:16] <greg5green> Pessimism: $(selector) will always return a jquery object, so therefore, when you check to see if it is true, it always will be
[10:08:19] <Grundell_> changed
[10:08:25] <rindolf> Grundell_: OK.
[10:08:32] <rindolf> Grundell_: what is the new URL?
[10:08:43] <greg5green> Pessimism: but if you check the length of that object, you can find out if there is truly something in that object
[10:09:08] <Grundell_> So now i want to add two more option fields on click, these ones should have different source / target
[10:09:19] <Grundell_> how do i make this happen in an easy way :)
[10:09:31] <Pessimism> greg5green: Thanks a bunch
[10:09:39] <greg5green> np :)
[10:09:57] <Grundell_> rindolf - http://jsfiddle.net/JuxNe/1/
[10:10:03] <Grundell_> Sorry
[10:10:55] <rindolf> Grundell_: thanks.
[10:11:19] <Grundell_> rindonf - i assume im the one to thank you for helping me :)
[10:13:29] <rindolf> Grundell_: rindolf*
[10:14:04] <Grundell_> rindolf -  was a little bit fast there...
[10:14:35] <rindolf> Grundell_: OK, you just misspelled my nickname.
[10:15:08] <Grundell_> rindolf - Yeah... will try to be a little bit more observant :)
[10:15:33] <rindolf> Grundell_: thanks.
[10:15:42] <rindolf> Grundell_: your IRC client should have tab completion.
[10:16:11] <rindolf> I'm the only ^rin.*$ here.
[10:16:27] <greg5green> Grundell_: I assume you are going to populate more divs with the class of select-freelancer-hidden via php?
[10:17:07] <Grundell_> rindolf: Yeah it has, but i am talking in the wordpress forum too so it's faster to write your name :)
[10:17:26] <Grundell_> fref5green: yeah
[10:17:34] <rindolf> Grundell_: hmmm....
[10:17:39] <Grundell_> rindolf:  ?
[10:17:47] <rindolf> Grundell_: just thinking.
[10:17:52] <rindolf> Anyway, about your jQ problem.
[10:18:01] <Grundell_> rindolf:  okay
[10:18:03] <Grundell_> yes ?
[10:18:23] <rindolf> Grundell_: did you try html(...) or .append() or whatever?
[10:19:05] <needinghelp> can somebody please tell me whats wrong with his
[10:19:05] <Grundell_> rindolf: no - im really bad with jQuery so I ask here :)
[10:19:06] <needinghelp> http://pastebin.com/RY8xgnmP
[10:19:25] <needinghelp> is it missing an hyphen somewhere
[10:19:54] <rindolf> Grundell_: « value="<?php if(isset($_POST['sourceTwo'])) echo $_POST['sourceTwo'];?>" » - don't do that - HTML injection/cross-site scripting.
[10:21:09] <Grundell_> rindolf: Sorry don't really understand, what i do there is simply getting the value in the <option> and putting it there :)
[10:21:12] <rindolf> Grundell_: http://perl-begin.org/topics/security/code-markup-injection/
[10:21:57] <rindolf> Grundell_: yes, and I can put in the POST «">javascript:alert('You suck!')»
[10:21:59] <Grundell_> rindolf: okay :)
[10:22:03] <needinghelp> rindolf sorry to interupt but could you take a very quick look at this small snip of code, http://pastebin.com/RY8xgnmP   it must be missing something trivial
[10:22:06] <rindolf> Grundell_: or something much nastier.
[10:22:12] <rindolf> needinghelp: let me see.
[10:22:18] <needinghelp> thank you
[10:22:37] <Grundell_> well since its a optionlist it shouldn't be something that you can write...
[10:22:39] <greg5green> Grundell_: you should listen to rindolf about that :P
[10:22:42] <rindolf> needinghelp: looks fine at first glance.

[10:22:53] <Grundell_> greg5green: will do :)
[10:22:56] <needinghelp> I am trying to fill in a hidden input field "brandid" with page_id
[10:23:21] <Grundell_> greg5green: Thank you so much!
[10:23:24] <rindolf> Grundell_: also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting .
[10:23:33] <greg5green> thats how i would do it if each select needs to have different options
[10:23:40] <greg5green> if each select has the same options, i'd do it differently
[10:24:07] <needinghelp> thats what I mean rindolf, I really cant see what is missing, its probably a colon somewhere, however I am not well versed enough with jquery to spot it
[10:24:25] <Grundell_> rindolf: I'll start to read up!
[10:25:14] <greg5green> needinghelp: on line 11, you need to end in );
[10:25:25] <greg5green> to close autocomplete()
[10:25:39] <greg5green> a
[10:25:56] <greg5green> and you need another } to close the anonymous function next to search
[10:26:35] <needinghelp> so $('#brandid').val('');     });
[10:26:37] <needinghelp> ?
[10:26:59] <greg5green> $('#brandid').val('');     }    });
[10:27:05] <greg5green> err
[10:27:10] <rindolf> needinghelp: did you try using Opera?
[10:27:11] <greg5green> from $('#brandid') on
[10:27:18] <rindolf> needinghelp: it's good about pinpointing problems.
[10:27:29] <greg5green> $('#brandid').val(''); }  });  });
[10:27:42] <Mik-_-> Hi, i need some help.. when i m trying to a datepicker to a text field on my drupal site i get js error 'uncaught typeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> had no method 'replace' .. prob a stupid error but i m a beginner, so plz help :)
[10:27:44] <needinghelp> no I didnt rindolf
[10:27:50] <greg5green> you had two unclosed functions
[10:27:52] <rindolf> needinghelp: OK.
[10:28:20] <rindolf> needinghelp: do you see anything in the JS console?
[10:28:29] <rindolf> needinghelp: did you try "use strict" too?
[10:33:57] <Mik-_-> Hi, i need some help.. when i m trying to a datepicker to a text field on my drupal site i get js error 'uncaught typeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> had no method 'replace' .. prob a stupid error but i m a beginner, so plz help :)
[10:35:10] <Grundell_> greg5green: i need to have the e.preventDefault(); somewhere, what line should i add it at =
[10:35:37] <Grundell_> (it doesn't work where you put it ...)
[10:36:48] <WouterDS> What is the easiest way to copy something to the user its clipboard in jQuery?
[10:37:37] <ilian> Hi, would it be a bad approach if instead of returning json with items I return rendered HTML for an autocomplete field?
[10:38:41] <greg5green> Grundell_: what do you mean it doesnt work where i put it? I only put it in there because you had it in your old function. I don't believe there is a default action for button tags
[10:39:04] <Grundell_> well the default action happens to post to my post...
[10:39:18] <Grundell_> So i need to remove that
[10:39:25] <needinghelp> Ill give opera a go thanks rindolf
[10:39:56] <needinghelp> greg5green closing the functions worked, but page_id is still being displayed
[10:40:00] <Grundell_> greg5green: got it to work :)
[10:40:15] <greg5green> Grundell_: it sounds like you might have had more than one event handler on it
[10:40:44] <rindolf> needinghelp: I dislike Opera because it's not open source, but it can be useful.
[10:41:17] <Grundell_> greg5green: maybe....
[10:41:18] <needinghelp> never really touched it
[10:42:05] <greg5green> ilian: I wouldn't do it that way for extensibility/robustness reasons, but I don't necessarily see anything wrong with doing it that way if it works (although I dont know what you're trying to do)

[10:45:30] <needinghelp> ah is this part   search: function() {         $('#brandid').val('');      supposed to look like      search: function() {         $('#brandid').val('page_id');
[10:48:10] <rindolf> needinghelp: let me see.

[10:48:58] <needinghelp> oh yeh I know this

[10:50:37] <needinghelp> can you see any obvious reason why "page_id" is still being displayed in autocomplete though rindolf?
[10:54:37] <needinghelp> greg5green sorry to bother ya again, but could tell me the reason has to why "page_id" is still being displayed in autocomplete   http://pastebin.com/tWhQWKEG
[10:56:58] <greg5green> needinghelp: i dont know the answer
[10:57:11] <needinghelp> aka it looks okay to you?
[10:57:17] <greg5green> syntaxically
[10:57:17] <greg5green> yes
[10:58:15] <greg5green> but I havent worked with that autocomplete plugin before
[10:58:33] <rindolf> needinghelp: why are you appending a string to results[] instead of an array or a record?
[11:00:54] <needinghelp> I just copied and pasted the mysql request and php for the array
[11:01:07] <needinghelp> so thats the problem its a single string instead of a record
[11:01:17] <needinghelp> @rindolf
[11:02:56] <Mik-_-> someone that can help me ?
[11:03:33] <rindolf> needinghelp: a record is more JSONy.
[11:03:40] <rindolf> Mik-_-: with what?
[11:03:53] <needinghelp> so are you saying json isnt doing anything
[11:03:54] <Mik-_-> Hi, i need some help.. when i m trying to a datepicker to a text field on my drupal site i get js error 'uncaught typeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> had no method 'replace' '
[11:04:14] <needinghelp> instead when the query finds a match the whole mysql row is being printed as a string
[11:04:24] <greg5green> Mik-_-: do you have a live example
[11:04:32] <greg5green> Can't do anything with what you've posted
[11:04:50] <blar1> hi all; i'm having some troubles building the 1.9-stable branch jquery; apparently there were (or are) some issues with grunt... anyone know if those have been resolved?
[11:05:08] <blar1> "$node -v" - v0.9.6-pre
[11:05:42] <blar1> "$grunt --version" "grunt-cli v0.1.6; grunt v0.4.0rc5"
[11:06:14] <blar1> just checked out jquery branch 1.9-stable; up to date, no local changes
[11:06:17] <blar1> npm install works
[11:06:43] <blar1> grunt fails with "cannot read property 'dest' of undefined"  after "running selector:src/selector.js"
[11:09:09] <Mik-_-> greg5green its on my localserver http://i46.tinypic.com/nn4akn.jpg this is a screen shot from the code
[11:09:37] <Mik-_-> i added the jquery files in my html template
[11:12:03] <greg5green> does your alert fire?
[11:12:55] <StephenS> how can I make my logo lighter on hover?
[11:13:05] <StephenS> like facebook have that thingy with box, but I just want to make it lighter
[11:17:18] <rindolf> StephenS: is it PNG or SVG?
[11:17:25] <StephenS> png
[11:17:28] <rindolf> StephenS: ah.
[11:17:34] <StephenS> <?>
[11:17:36] <rindolf> StephenS: well, you can change the src="..."
[11:17:44] <StephenS> I know but eh.. :D
[11:18:01] <rindolf> StephenS: http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/ - see the stuff with the arrows here.
[11:18:16] <rindolf> StephenS: it doesn't work properly in Opera though due to a bug.
[11:18:42] <rindolf> StephenS: but Opera users should not be a major concern.
[11:19:56] <StephenS> Which effect does ask.fm website logo use?
[11:20:48] <StephenS> All I see in css is #logo {display: block; width: 98px; height: 40px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 28px; padding-right: 0px; border: none; background-image: url(/images/logo-green.png); background-position: top center; background-repeat: no-repeat; float: left}
[11:20:48] <StephenS> #logo:hover {background-position: bottom center} not sure for jquery
[11:22:35] <StephenS> rindolf, ?
[11:22:38] <rindolf> StephenS: maybe it displays a different part of the .png every time.
[11:22:52] <StephenS> hmmmm their pic is http://ask.fm//images/logo-green.png
[11:22:53] <rindolf> StephenS: I've seen it in action.
[11:23:02] <StephenS> I see two logo on same png?
[11:23:10] <rindolf> It's a bandwidth saving trick.
[11:23:21] <rindolf> Or at least one that reduces requests.
[11:23:56] <greg5green> StephenS, rindolf, that's the css sprite technique
[11:24:00] <greg5green> they have one image
[11:24:11] <greg5green> and on hover, they change the part of the image they are showing
[11:24:21] <rindolf> greg5green: OK.
[11:24:46] <StephenS> ah I see
[11:24:48] <greg5green> you do it that way so that when you hover over the image, it already has the "hover image" loaded and doesnt have to make another http request
[11:24:53] <StephenS> so they load whole pic and just changing position
[11:26:24] <StephenS> greg5green, that can be achived with code above?
[11:26:40] <greg5green> that is exactly what that code does
[11:27:21] <greg5green> the background-image, background-position, background-repeat properties are what are needed for that
[11:27:38] <greg5green> you might want to set a width and height and maybe overflow to auto
[11:40:23] <StephenS> greg5green, now my pic is popping
[11:40:32] <StephenS> like when I hover over it it move a bit up
[11:40:50] <greg5green> ok, instead of using keywords like top
[11:40:52] <greg5green> and bottom
[11:41:01] <greg5green> use pixels to set the position
[11:42:28] <greg5green> or else, you could take a screen shot and measure in photoshop how far off it is and edit the image you used in your css to fix it
[11:46:57] <Noriandir> hi. i'm trying to do something like this: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists but after the drop I want to notify the server that the item has changed to a new place and save it. i've tried to do this: http://pastie.org/5674981 but the this is the list where the card was initially, not where i've placed it...
[11:51:43] <Noriandir> anyone?
[11:52:02] <ilian> greg5green, sorry I saw a little late your answer for the HTML instead of JSON for autocomplete, I was just thinking that it may be more clean to generate the HTML in the backend instead of concatenaiting strings in the javascript like '<li>' + item.name .....
[11:52:30] <greg5green> in one sense it is
[11:52:47] <greg5green> but if you ever want to change what the page looks like, you have to deal with redoing code in the backend too
[11:52:51] <greg5green> along with on the front end
[11:53:08] <greg5green> whereas with JSON, you'd just edit your front end and leave the backend alone
[11:54:02] <booom> http://www.nigga.jo/
[11:54:08] <ilian> maybe it will be more clean if there is a way to use something like variable inside the HTML instead of string concatenation, something like parsing or "template"
[11:56:07] <greg5green> json is so much nicer to work with tho :P
[11:56:39] <ilian> but how to generate the HTML without concatenation is there a nicer way?
[11:56:40] <booom> #javascript
[11:57:31] <booom> http://webservice.ws/
[11:57:35] <StephenS> Done with img :D
[11:57:44] <StephenS> its so ool technique thanks greg5green
[11:57:55] <greg5green> np :)
[11:58:01] <booom> np np
[11:58:02] <booom> ;)
[11:58:09] <booom> thanks you too
[11:59:42] <booom> @greg5green #joomla
[11:59:51] <greg5green> why would i go there
[12:00:00] <booom> cause i want you to go there
[12:00:08] <greg5green> but i don't want to
[12:00:15] <booom> but i want!!
[12:00:17] <booom> go!
[12:00:55] <booom> you can choose one of these #joomla #adobeflash #microsoft #silverlight
[12:00:56] <greg5green> ilian, you could append the json response to inline span elements?
[12:01:04] <greg5green> do i have to
[12:01:34] <booom> any strafucking microsoft fan here?
[12:02:06] <ilian> greg5green, can you give me an example, also I have a bit more complex HTML <a><ol><li> ...
[12:02:44] <shoky> ilian, html templating is a very common approach
[12:03:04] <greg5green> <li>this is some sentence i want to interject <span id="spottoinsertthings">my json</span> into.</li>
[12:04:55] <ilian> I am currently using something like ..  '<li class="autoc-name">' + item.name + '</li>' + ...
[12:07:14] <shoky> another jquery way..  $('<li>').addClass('autoc-name').text(item.name)
[12:08:16] <ilian> shoky, with more complex HTML this will turn to hell for maintain
[12:08:23] <shoky> agreed
[12:08:37] <shoky> which is why i first mentioned html templating
[12:09:42] <ilian> can I do it in the front-end
[12:09:56] <shoky> yes
[12:10:04] <ilian> how?
[12:10:29] <shoky> tons of options.. see for example handlebars or mustache.js
[12:11:07] <ilian> thanks I'll take a look
[12:11:16] <greg5green> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[12:11:49] <shoky> also this is pretty old but still nice.. http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[12:13:48] <ilian> handlebars look pretty cool
[12:13:56] <ilian> I think I'll go with it,
[12:15:18] <ilian> thanks you all for the help

I have found solution for doing this with jquery that look quick and easy, but the twist I have to deal with is that all the files and the index page are all local files. Is this still possible to do with jquery?
[15:33:22] <nashant> Alright guys. For some reason I'm completely unable to prevent a form from submitting. e.preventDefault() and return false not doing anything
[15:37:51] <grafi> have you checked if you use the right selectors?
[15:58:46] <khaan> hi guys: i'm searching for something that loads separate pages and moves them off and onscreen with lazy loading with transitions. i'm in a wp environment, so to speak...
[17:33:47] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, I"m looking at a line of code I'm not quite understanding
[17:33:49] <lethjakman_lapto>       return ($('#main-image img')).attr('src', ($(event.currentTarget)).find('a').attr('href'));
[17:34:14] <lethjakman_lapto> it looks like that, when it executes it loads an identicle image right below it. why is it loading another image?
[17:34:44] <n3x> show_variant_images = (variant_id) ->
[17:34:44] <n3x>   ($ 'li.vtmb').hide()
[17:34:44] <n3x>   ($ 'li.vtmb-' + variant_id).show()
[17:34:45] <n3x>   currentThumb = ($ '#' + ($ '#main-image').data('selectedThumbId'))
[17:34:47] <n3x>   if not currentThumb.hasClass('vtmb-' + variant_id)
[17:34:49] <n3x>     thumb = ($ ($ 'ul.thumbnails li:visible.vtmb').eq(0))
[17:34:49] <lethjakman_lapto> I don'see anything that looks like it should append it
[17:34:51] <n3x>     thumb = ($ ($ 'ul.thumbnails li:visible').eq(0)) unless thumb.length > 0
[17:34:53] <n3x>     newImg = thumb.find('a').attr('href')
[17:34:55] <n3x>     ($ 'ul.thumbnails li').removeClass 'selected'
[17:34:57] <n3x>     thumb.addClass 'selected'
[17:34:59] <n3x>     ($ '#main-image img').attr 'src', newImg
[17:35:01] <n3x>     ($ '#main-image').data 'selectedThumb', newImg
[17:35:03] <n3x>     ($ '#main-image').data 'selectedThumbId', thumb.attr('id')
[17:35:22] <lethjakman_lapto> n3x: that's a significant amount of code, you should probably put it in a gist.github.com or something
[17:37:25] <eddiemonge> lethjakman_lapto: i dont understand that code. why are there () around the selectors?
[17:37:53] <lethjakman_lapto> I have no clue, I didn't write it
[17:37:55] <eddiemonge> lethjakman_lapto: what does that return to?
[17:38:15] <lethjakman_lapto> one sec, I'll post the whole thing
[17:38:38] <lethjakman_lapto> https://gist.github.com/4521703
[17:39:13] <lethjakman_lapto> eddiemonge: does that help at all? I'm at a loss with this code...
[17:41:15] <eddiemonge> lethjakman_lapto: i would rewrite all that code
[17:41:19] <grafi> where did you get it? ^^

[17:41:43] <lethjakman_lapto> it might be a gem I have
[17:44:35] <vrlogrs> hey guys ..
[17:45:04] <eddiemonge> scary
[17:45:15] <vrlogrs> is there any way i can "cancel" a drag-and-drop while in the drop function?
[17:45:23] <vrlogrs> revert back basically
[17:49:03] <eddiemonge> dont drop it?
[17:49:11] <vrlogrs> yah ..
[17:49:19] <vrlogrs> but,i want it to go back to its last spot
[17:52:28] <vrlogrs> does that make sense :S
[17:54:50] <vrlogrs> oh, got it
[17:54:55] <vrlogrs> nvm .. thanks anyways
[17:55:11] <grafi> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-revert
[17:55:17] <grafi> something like that`?
[17:55:22] <vrlogrs> yah
[17:55:27] <vrlogrs> thats what i got :)
[17:55:29] <vrlogrs> thanks
[17:55:43] <grafi> ^^
[18:06:27] <thisboy> http://jsfiddle.net/58dRZ/ -- I have a rather long sentence inside a rather small container, that should not break off into new lines, but allow the user to slide back and forth on the same line using "smart" mouse movement. Can someone show me how this is possible? Or maybe point me to some cool libraries that might help?
[18:08:20] <grafi> and how would those smart mousemovements work, in your mind?
[18:09:15] <grafi> ah, i see ;)
[18:12:24] <eddiemonge> thisboy: you mean like a scrolling div?
[18:14:54] <thisboy> sorta yeah :^)
[18:15:07] <thisboy> scrolling div is probably a better name for it yeah
[18:15:43] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/58dRZ/2/
[18:15:58] <eddiemonge> thats the simplest solution possible
[18:17:59] <eddiemonge> otherwise you have to figure out the length of the sentence to see if it should scroll. and you wouldnt do it with mouse movements, as thats not good UX. a better solution would be to have "buttons" that you can then hover over to make the text scroll in that direction
[18:18:26] <eddiemonge> but then how fast do you make the scroll? people read at different speeds and some people are going to inevitably be frustrated at the speed
[18:18:39] <eddiemonge> not to mention the arrows taking up more space, leaving less reading room
[18:26:24] <thisboy> eddiemonge: cool
[18:26:57] <thisboy> good point there man actually
[18:27:20] <thisboy> actually this is a stroke of brilliance i think im just gonna do it like this
[18:27:35] <thisboy> thanks a lot man
[18:30:46] <eddiemonge> np
[19:34:00] <EyePulp> so how do I make sure something is applied to a selector even if it's dynamically created?  $('div.foo').barfunc();
[19:34:48] <EyePulp> for example -- if I create a new div class='foo'  how do I make sure .barfunc() is applied?
[19:35:07] <EyePulp> would I use .on? if so, what event am I watching?
[19:39:29] <sahbeewah> you can't.
[19:39:49] <sahbeewah> you'll need to apply the function after you create it. manually...
[19:39:59] <EyePulp> I see.  nuyts
[19:40:01] <EyePulp> er, nuts
[19:50:46] <Whirl3d> does the focus event propagate up the chain? or do you have to listen for the event on the element
[20:03:00] <Whirl3d> Here's an easier question: can you set the height of an element like $(el).height("1em"); or do you have to use $(el).css("height", "1em");
[20:29:25] <eip56> Ok so Im running a ajax request to a html page. It returns the html page. How do I select a specific tag fromt hat return. I tried $(data).find() but it gives me an object object response
[20:30:49] <tw2113> have you tried inspecting what's in the object?
[20:32:28] <sahbeewah> Whirl3d, it doesn't normally make sense to propagate focus up the chain, because no focusable elements can be contain other focusable elements
[20:32:42] <sahbeewah> with the exception of the anchor tag... which jquery doesn't support, apparently
[20:33:33] <sahbeewah> and .height(...) and .css('height', ...) are the same
[20:50:02] <pilgo> How do I find out if an event was bound by on() ?
[20:51:18] <pilgo> I know I can off() it
[20:51:27] <pilgo> But not what I want
[20:51:36] <pilgo> I just don't want to bind the same function twice
[20:51:53] <thisboy> How do I make http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/5/ like this: http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png ? Was not able to achieve this with CSS alone..
[20:52:46] <thisboy> (should be fluid)
[20:54:46] <pzuraq> thisboy: What are you trying to do in the second picture there?
[20:54:51] <pzuraq> what is that scrollbar?
[20:56:54] <thisboy> pzuraq: what do you mean?
[20:57:27] <pzuraq> I'm not quite sure what you're trying to do
[20:57:40] <pzuraq> I think it can be done with pure CSS if it is what I think it is
[20:58:00] <pzuraq> but that seems kind of... unintuitive I guess
[20:59:07] <thisboy> I'm trying to add horizontal scrolling to anything with class .scroll if it overflows the size of each black box. Trying to get JS to first set the width of each black box, and then apply white-space nowrap and overflow auto.
[20:59:36] <thisboy> It should be fluid hence the window resize function there..
[21:00:09] <thisboy> pzuraq: we tried that in #css just now. we did make it work but then i had to disable the float left shrink wrapping which i so desperately need :/
[21:00:52] <thisboy> my fiddle is a bit buggy, like right now it sets all black boxes to the width of the first black box - not sure how to fix that though
[21:00:57] <pzuraq> hold up a sec
[21:01:03] <pzuraq> I'm working on a fix
[21:01:57] <thisboy> great thanks
[21:04:05] <pzuraq> the problem in this instance is that the paragraph wants to wrap
[21:04:22] <pzuraq> it isn't going to extend beyond the bounds of it's container
[21:05:05] <thisboy> pzuraq: my JS should handle that already though
[21:06:12] <thisboy> idk.. confused..
[21:06:30] <pzuraq> ah
[21:06:32] <pzuraq> so it does
[21:07:27] <thisboy> yeah it just needs to measure width and set width for each black box respectively
[21:07:53] <thisboy> as opposed to giving them all the same width i reckon
[21:07:55] <pzuraq> ok, now you need to put in a container object that has overflow: scroll
[21:08:22] <thisboy> dont you mean overflow auto?
[21:10:50] <pzuraq> thisboy: http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/6/
[21:12:31] <thisboy> pzuraq: sorry I think we've misunderstood each other
[21:12:44] <thisboy> pzuraq: the goal is to make it exactly like http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png
[21:13:18] <thisboy> and the black boxes should be fluid (i.e. adjust automatically as the user resizes her screen)
[21:13:24] <other> hello
[21:13:32] <thisboy> because of this I see no other option but to use JS
[21:14:03] <pzuraq> then set width to 100%
[21:14:49] <other> how can i add click handler to all tags with specified id? $(function() {$("#foo").click(bar);}) adds only to first one
[21:15:41] <thisboy> pzuraq: cool
[21:15:46] <pzuraq> thisboy: If you're trying to account for the margin, I know how to do that using jquery
[21:15:53] <pzuraq> lesse...
[21:16:27] <thisboy> pzuraq: is there a way to drop the containers inside each .maindiv though?
[21:17:08] <thisboy> no wait, by setting 100% it wont shrink wrap
[21:17:35] <pzuraq> if you want a scrollbar like that, the element that's scrolling has to be contained by a div of fixed width
[21:18:06] <thisboy> pzuraq: yup exactly
[21:18:37] <pzuraq> so you have to have the inner container
[21:18:41] <thisboy> pzuraq: so  basically im trying to measure and set a fixed width for each of the black box at http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/5/
[21:18:48] <ksaul> is there a php irc? :(
[21:18:53] <pzuraq> #php
[21:18:56] <ksaul> says invite
[21:19:03] <pzuraq> register your nick
[21:19:06] <pzuraq> with nickserv
[21:19:08] <ksaul> ight ty
[21:19:22] <sahbeewah> other, id attributes are meant to be unique on a page, which is why jquery stops at the first one
[21:20:14] <thisboy> the html and css at http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/5/ works, i just need its js to measure and set the width for each  black box respectively - as opposed to giving them all the same width i reckon
[21:20:28] <sahbeewah> other, if you insist on breaking everything... $('[id=foo]').click( ...
[21:21:02] <pzuraq> thisboy: Oh, you're right. Sorry, I didn't see the scroll bar on the paragraph (that's what I get for using osx eh :P
[21:21:03] <pzuraq> )
[21:21:06] <pzuraq> lemme get you that
[21:21:07] <KernelDog> Sup guys?
[21:22:04] <thisboy> hehe
[21:23:25] <b1lly> thisboy: you're confusing me
[21:23:29] <b1lly> what are you trying to accomplish
[21:23:51] <thisboy> ok hold up let me summarize
[21:24:34] <other> sahbeewah: i'm doing unobtrusive js, so i don't want to specify onclick="bar()" for my generated links, i have 1 js file specifically for that page(with [id=foo] elements)
[21:25:04] <other> all js in .js, all html in .html
[21:25:29] <b1lly> other: is there a question in there?
[21:26:09] <other> b1lly: question?
[21:26:20] <b1lly> I just joined the channel so
[21:26:23] <b1lly> I missed if there was a question
[21:26:28] <b1lly> that was related to the unobtrusive js
[21:27:23] <other> sahbeewah: hm, now it returns "TypeError.handle.apply is not a function"
[21:27:49] <thisboy> ok here we go
[21:27:53] <b1lly> other: mind if I take a peak
[21:28:17] <thisboy> How do I make http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/5/ like this: http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png ?
[21:28:20] <thisboy> I need the JS to measure and set the widths of each black box respectively - as opposed to now where it gives both black boxes the width of the first one.
[21:28:23] <thisboy> It should also repeat this procedure whenever the window is being resized. I don't know if there's a bug in my window resize function or if it's just JSFiddle getting in the way.
[21:29:34] <pzuraq> thisboy: Almost done...
[21:29:45] <thisboy> :^)
[21:29:55] <thisboy> bless this man right here
[21:30:45] <sahbeewah> other, you have other problems... show your code if you want help
[21:31:04] <sahbeewah> other,  i was just explaining why id selectors will only return max 1 elements
[21:31:12] <b1lly> thisboy: why even use JS for that?
[21:31:20] <other> b1lly: i have liks with onclick="foo();", to unobtrusify(heh) it i need to remove that onlick from my html file and add it from js dynamically
[21:31:49] <thisboy> b1lly: we tried a css only version in #css but that didnt go so well
[21:31:50] <b1lly> $('selector').click(function() { //do stuff });
[21:32:05] <b1lly> thisboy: fail?
[21:32:18] <thisboy> yep we failed
[21:32:23] <thisboy> horribly
[21:32:42] <thisboy> especially since the black boxes had to be shrink wrapped and all
[21:33:39] <other> sahbeewah: oh yeah, that was my fault, thanks, it works now
[21:36:15] <other> i wonder if i understood "unombtrusive js" in rifht way, or removing onlicks form my html is a little too much?
[21:39:51] <thisboy> ah wait
[21:42:33] <b1lly> thisboy: http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/8/
[21:42:37] <b1lly> great success
[21:43:22] <thisboy> hehe great success :)
[21:43:33] <thisboy> b1lly: no sorry but each black box should be shrinkwrapped
[21:43:42] <b1lly> "shrinkwrapped" ?
[21:44:14] <thisboy> shrink wrapped
[21:44:15] <sahbeewah> other, You should never have onclick attributes in your html
[21:44:35] <b1lly> thisboy: I don't get what that means?
[21:44:40] <thisboy> b1lly: yep the black should only reach as far as the content, not all the way to the end of the page
[21:44:41] <b1lly> explain?
[21:44:55] <b1lly> the black should only reach as far as the content?
[21:44:57] <thisboy> basically the effect of float: left
[21:45:05] <thisboy> yeah see http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png
[21:45:14] <b1lly> the bottom one
[21:45:18] <thisboy> as far as the paragraph
[21:45:20] <b1lly> is the size of the page
[21:45:25] <b1lly> simply float left the first paragraph
[21:45:25] <thisboy> no the top one there you can see the shrink wrap in action
[21:45:27] <b1lly> aka #main
[21:45:34] <pzuraq> thisboy: http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/10/
[21:45:37] <pzuraq> mostly working
[21:45:54] <thisboy> oh hell to the yes!
[21:46:16] <pzuraq> was tricky
[21:46:38] <thisboy> :^)
[21:46:44] <b1lly> pure css http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/8/
[21:46:46] <thisboy> looks great, thank you *so* much
[21:46:51] <b1lly> woops
[21:46:55] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/11/
[21:47:52] <b1lly> ^ win
[21:47:52] <kerozene> #jquery, for all your css needs
[21:47:53] <thisboy> b1lly: that would work but unfortunately each of the black boxes needs to be treated the same
[21:48:05] <b1lly> ...
[21:49:21] <thisboy> b1lly: basically each black box is a forum post
[21:49:43] <b1lly> and?
[21:50:20] <b1lly> you shouldn't use javascript when it's not necessary
[21:50:44] <thisboy> and there is no #main or #wrapper, only div like in the original html
[21:50:51] <b1lly> so
[21:50:55] <b1lly> use div
[21:50:57] <b1lly> instead of main and wrapper..
[21:51:00] <b1lly> its just an example
[21:51:08] <kerozene> thisboy: you're being incredibly vague. I'm not surprised you got no help on #css
[21:51:23] <thisboy> wait wait wait hold up
[21:52:27] <thisboy> pretty darn sweet what you did here b1lly i think we have a winner
[21:56:42] <thisboy> b1lly: http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/12/ im sorry but i still cant shrink wrap the divs :/
[21:56:45] <other> sahbeewah: ok, great, i did a right thing :)
[21:57:42] <thisboy> kerozene: yeah i know, these things are almost harder to explain than emotions :^) but basically http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png is what im trying to do
[21:58:33] <kerozene> thisboy: but you're describing dynamic behaviour (in a way I can't understand) and a static image doesn't inform that
[21:59:05] <kerozene> at least, not without arrows and shit
[21:59:09] <thisboy> hmm yeah i see your point
[21:59:50] <nightfly> Is the "shrink wrap" you're talking about padding around the divs?
[22:01:21] <b1lly> thisboy: you're giving us a terrible sample
[22:01:29] <b1lly> TABLES work different then divs
[22:01:59] <ChrisBolton> Has anyone used select2 and rails?
[22:02:01] <b1lly> tables by default inherit the width of its contents, divs do not
[22:02:22] <b1lly> divs inherit the width of their parent
[22:02:37] <b1lly> your form probably uses tables
[22:03:41] <thisboy> im not using tables and it's not a form
[22:03:52] <thisboy> just divs like that
[22:04:08] <b1lly> so what is it your building
[22:04:11] <b1lly> show me
[22:04:13] <thisboy> our dearly departed pzuraq's example works great though im all set
[22:04:15] <b1lly> because this sample is not getting us anywhere
[22:04:26] <b1lly> ok
[22:04:29] <b1lly> emjoy
[22:04:33] <b1lly> enjoy
[22:05:12] <kerozene> hakon wium lie is crying now
[22:05:48] <thisboy> thanks a lot b1lly
[22:06:59] <thisboy> b1lly: what im building should behave exactly like the fiddle you gave me (http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/11/ - i.e. http://i.imgur.com/9kSiK.png) - except the markup should look exactly like http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/5/
[22:07:36] <thisboy> b1lly: if it was a static site i'd have no problem giving the various boxes their own ids to make your css work but unfortunately that is not the case
[22:07:48] <thisboy> im probably being equally vague again, sorry folks
[22:07:53] <thisboy> kerozene: why is he crying?
[22:08:20] <kerozene> because you made him sad
[22:08:31] <thisboy> hehe
[22:09:06] <thisboy> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/H%C3%A5kon-Wium-Lie-2009-03.jpg/220px-H%C3%A5kon-Wium-Lie-2009-03.jpg
[22:09:24] <thisboy> im sure that sweater there would work wonders on a night out on town :P
[22:10:33] <kerozene> you're building an interface and you have no control over the markup?
[22:10:42] <thisboy> well, better than http://farm1.staticflickr.com/101/261627247_b45cca4cb0.jpg anyhow
[22:11:18] <thisboy> kerozene: no but each black box is a user generated forum post, they cant have different ids
[22:11:41] <b1lly> why
[22:11:42] <kerozene> I see
[22:11:50] <b1lly> i disagree
[22:11:52] <b1lly> but whatever
[22:12:11] <b1lly> if it's user generated forum posts, they are coming from a db
[22:12:13] <b1lly> each post has an id
[22:12:20] <b1lly> those ids can be printed into the template :D
[22:12:24] <b1lly> regardless
[22:12:34] <thisboy> b1lly: yeah thats true
[22:12:40] <b1lly> do what you want
[22:12:45] <b1lly> we're not going to figure this out
[22:12:55] <thisboy> but one post cant be named #main and another one #wrapper that would make no sense
[22:13:02] <thisboy> right now they're all named .post
[22:13:08] <b1lly> so what you do is
[22:13:16] <b1lly> you have 2 wrappers
[22:13:24] <b1lly> 1 around the content and one full width of page
[22:13:40] <b1lly> anyway
[22:14:33] <b1lly> i wanna do something fun
[22:14:41] <b1lly> anyone?
[22:15:48] <kerozene> am I going insane or is this what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/13/
[22:16:32] <b1lly> win^
[22:16:37] <b1lly> max-width
[22:17:09] <thisboy> ha!
[22:17:18] <thisboy> win indeed my man
[22:17:31] <kerozene> forgot to consolodate the selectors
[22:17:37] <kerozene> o/i
[22:17:45] <thisboy> :D
[22:17:59] <kerozene> still sane? ok good
[22:18:15] <thisboy> guess i dont need http://jsfiddle.net/CRY5J/10/ then
[22:18:26] <thisboy> and a million thanks
[22:18:33] <thisboy> to you too b1lly for paving the way for kerozene
[22:19:15] <kerozene> we dedicate this glorious victory to hakon, long may he reign
[22:19:29] <thisboy> yeah lets do that :)
[23:05:20] <joshuabud> Curious if someone can help me write an ajax function for something like this $('#mainMenuPage').bind('pageshow', function(event){
[23:05:20] <joshuabud>   stillLoggedIn();
[23:09:38] <joshuabud> I'm trying to change the #mainMenuPage to mainMenuPage.html
[23:09:48] <joshuabud> which is why I need the ajax call.
