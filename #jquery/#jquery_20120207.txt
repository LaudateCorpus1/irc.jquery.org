[00:11:17] <iateadonut> redsquare, thanks.
[00:45:05] <niels__> how would you do this var test = document.getElementById("tags_1").value; with jQuery?
[00:47:16] <JKarsrud> ?val @ niels__
[00:47:17] <bot-t1> niels__, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[00:48:34] <xec> $('#tags_1').val()
[00:49:17] <niels__> var value = $("#tags_1").val(); works great
[00:49:18] <niels__> thanks
[01:03:38] <DukeDrake> hi
[01:03:45] <xec> hi
[01:04:00] <DukeDrake> how can I add a css-hover style to an element with .css() ?
[01:05:37] <JKarsrud> DukeDrake: you don't. You use .hover(), and set the CSS. Or you set a class
[01:05:49] <JKarsrud> .css() sets properties, not selectors
[01:06:14] <DukeDrake> ok, thanx
[01:14:46] <DukeDrake> errr
[01:15:00] <DukeDrake> it only turns the CSS 'on' this way
[01:15:00] <JKarsrud> err?
[01:15:10] <nFFF> derr
[01:15:11] <nFFF> p
[01:15:11] <JKarsrud> hover takes two handler
[01:15:18] <DukeDrake> oh
[01:15:47] <JKarsrud> elem.hover(function() { //this happens on mouseenter },function() {// this happens on mouseleave });
[01:16:29] <Xotix>                 $.post("/frontend/save", { 'contentData': data,
[01:16:29] <Xotix>                                            'id'         : ,
[01:16:29] <Xotix>                                            'authKey'    :  }); With JS, i can't write it like that?
[01:16:30] <DukeDrake> kthx
[01:17:09] <JKarsrud> Xotix: don't paste in the channel, please :/
[01:17:21] <JKarsrud> but what do you mean, write it like that?
[01:17:44] <xec> Xotix: id and authKey is empty? as in syntax error?
[01:18:11] <JKarsrud> they'd have to be either '' or null or something
[01:18:18] <JKarsrud> they need a value, even if it's nothing
[01:19:19] <Xotix> Split it over several lines. With a string you are not allowed to. I'm getting the error , is an unexpected token. They are something.
[01:20:06] <JKarsrud> Xotix: yes, because you haven't assigned a value to your keys
[01:20:26] <xec> Xotix: a basic object literal looks like this: { key: "value" }
[01:20:36] <JKarsrud> it's complaining about the comma, because it's expecting a value
[01:20:37] <xec> Xotix: you left out the value part of both id and authKey
[01:22:42] <muzone> I'm trying to re-edit my design to fit within a grid: http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf
[01:22:45] <muzone> But with the famous 960px grid: http://www.gridsystemgenerator.com/gs01.php?GridWidth=960&GridColumns=12&GridMarginLeft=10&GridMarginRight=10 - what's with the margins to the far left and far right of the grid? Why are they there?
[01:22:49] <muzone> What purpose does it serve but to leave a 10px gap in the beginning and end of ones design? Isn't it up to the designer - and beyond the function of the grid - to dictate the spaces outside the grid? Or is there some sorta unwritten rule that the far left and far right margins aren't suppose to be included - that the 960px grid really only is 940px?
[01:22:54] <muzone> Considering how standard the 960px grid is, how it's based on architectural principles (golden ratio etc.), how it's used by millions of designers the world over - surely everything about it must have a purpose.
[01:22:58] <muzone> sorry if this is too offtopic
[01:22:58] <Xotix> Oh, you are right. Sry about that. I got my msitake now. thanks
[01:25:08] <xec> muzone: this has nothing to do with jquery
[01:25:24] <Leuthihi> Hello everyone.
[01:26:03] <bizar> can anyone help me with an ebay question
[01:26:30] <someprimetime> bizar: yeah only if you answer my salesforce question first

[01:28:57] <bizar> if someone wants "bank deposit" as payment do i need to contact them to get thir details?
[01:29:05] <bizar> their*
[01:29:18] <muzone> yeah yeah
[01:29:20] <someprimetime> bizar: i was joking because i thought you were
[01:30:03] <bizar> i'm serious as a heart attack
[01:31:28] <bizar> guess nobody knows ay
[01:31:42] <bigkevmcd> bizar: yeah, but I wouldn't pay via bank deposit...you've got very little comeback (if any) if it goes awry
[01:32:14] <Carlitta87> is there a javascript that can do the action of the shop by button on this page: http://www.lalicious.com/?
[01:32:18] <Carlitta87> jquery
[01:32:25] <bizar> hmm, thats the only payment option he has available.
[01:32:38] <bizar> hope this bloke isnt dodgy
[01:33:06] <bizar> its the 1st time i've bought something on ebay, he has good reviews
[01:33:07] <someprimetime> Carlyes
[01:33:10] <someprimetime> Carlitta87: yes
[01:33:36] <Carlitta87> someprimetime: u know where i can find it?
[01:33:40] <Carlitta87> or do i have to make it?
[01:33:43] <someprimetime> put each element in a span within a container and z-index them appropriately. then use animate()
[01:33:46] <someprimetime> ?animate @ Carlitta87
[01:33:46] <Carlitta87> crunched on time
[01:33:46] <hurry> hi, i have some div with name id="box" when i click on link inside the box, i want that this box turn to hide. how can i detect the correct box?
[01:33:47] <bot-t1> Carlitta87, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:33:47] <Carlitta87> :(
[01:34:09] <someprimetime> that wouldn't take long at all to do.
[01:36:43] <hurry> from children to orginal div
[01:42:53] <faraway> hi, i'm looking for a "lightbox" plugin that will "shrink" the images so that it will fit the screen resolution if it is bigger
[01:43:55] <Cork> faraway: just set the dimentions of the img tag
[01:45:51] <faraway> Cork: i hoped that it will be done automatically. i have a thumbnail e.g. 100x80, and an image with 1200x1000, not i want to make sure that if the window has e.g. 1024x900 that the image will auto "shrinked" to fit the window size
[01:46:32] <Carlitta87> bot-t1: u mind helping me out?... :(
[01:46:35] <bot-t1> Carlitta87, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[01:48:12] <hurry> can i hide a box that have inside a link with function hide?
[01:53:04] <Cork> hurry: you mean hide the block from clicking the link?
[01:53:19] <hurry> yes, i have many block
[01:53:31] <Cork> do you have a class on the "box"?
[01:53:39] <hurry> id="box"
[01:53:46] <hurry> class => css?
[01:53:52] <Cork> uh... $('#box').hide()
[01:54:01] <Cork> id's are uniq
[01:54:12] <hurry> i have many bloc, if i do that delete the first
[01:54:22] <hurry> i quante delete the box where i clicked
[01:54:28] <Cork> if you have many, you can't use id="box"
[01:54:35] <Cork> you need to use class
[01:56:31] <hurry> and than    $('.box').hide()  =
[01:56:33] <hurry> ?
[01:57:13] <Clorith> $(".box").click(function() { $(this).hide(); }); <-- that at least ;P
[01:57:44] <Clorith> You said you wanted to hide the box that was clicked, so you have to first attach a .click handler to the class
[01:58:09] <Clorith> Then make it run the hide function on the clicked element, if not it will hide all elements with the class "box"
[01:58:43] <hurry> Clorith:  it's works thanks!
[01:58:52] <hurry> thanks Cork
[01:58:54] <Cork> hurry: $(this).closest('.box').hide()
[01:59:11] <Cork> if your clicking the link thats what you want
[01:59:36] <Clorith> But then you also want $(".box a").click as the hook
[01:59:53] <hurry> when i have many box i must use class no id right ?
[02:02:17] <hurry> Clorith: can i get .box with keyword, like parent ecc?
[02:02:45] <nFFF> hurry, id's are unique
[02:03:11] <hurry> nFFF: perfect thanks
[02:03:15] <nFFF> So how can you use id to select many elements?
[02:03:31] <nFFF> You need to probably have a better grasp of exactly what your doing
[02:03:56] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/24/ every time a radio button is clicked, i'm adding an attribute of "active" and setting it to true... each click on a radio element, i want to check to see if any of the spans contain the attribute and remove them if they do... what's the best way to do so?
[02:04:00] <nFFF> rather than doing on a ad hoc basis
[02:04:13] <hurry> nFFF: thanks very kind
[02:04:41] <someprimetime> within the click handler for $radioButton I was thinking of like $container.find('span').attr('active'); but it doesn't output true if i write it to the console.log until i click two times on the a radio button
[02:05:48] <sahana> hi, I am dynamically adding images using dom and I want to trigger the fancybox in js. I have tried $('#hyplink').trigger('click'); and $('#hyplink').click(); It is not working. any idea?
[02:07:18] <nFFF> someprimetime, can't you simply do: $('input[type="radio"]').each(function(){ if($(this).attr('active') == 'true') { $(this).attr('active', ' '); } });
[02:09:37] <nFFF> oh maybe I misread, just use closest: $(this).closest('.span').attr('value', ' ' );
[02:09:38] <someprimetime> nFFF: hmm i'm putting the value within the span, let me see if i can't get this working
[02:09:59] <nFFF> and maybe check to see if the value exists first with the if statement
[02:11:25] <nFFF> $('input[type="radio"]').click(function(){ if($(this).closest('span').attr('value') == 'true') { $(this).closest('span').attr('value',' '); } });
[02:13:42] <someprimetime> nFFF: hmm the thing is upon each click, i need to loop through all elements within the form and remove them
[02:14:37] <someprimetime> so i guess i'll use that and an .each(0
[02:14:40] <someprimetime> each(), rather
[02:16:33] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to make jquery (or js) constantly listen for a change in dom?
[02:16:33] <nFFF> someprimetime yea
[02:17:01] <yamahaalex37> specificly, if a class has changed to contain "selected"
[02:17:28] <nFFF> someprimetime, so when the radio gets clicked, check every span adn remove the active atrributue?
[02:17:39] <someprimetime> nFFF: yeah
[02:17:45] <someprimetime> because one of them will have it
[02:17:48] <someprimetime> just not sure which one
[02:17:52] <nFFF> yamahaalex37, yes, look at event ahndlers
[02:18:02] <nFFF> someprimetime ok
[02:18:09] <someprimetime> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/25/
[02:18:26] <someprimetime> it doesn't activate that conditional until all of them are clicked, for some reason
[02:18:32] <someprimetime> on $container.each(function() {});
[02:18:37] <nFFF> Can't you use a normal selector
[02:18:44] <someprimetime> like an id?
[02:18:56] <someprimetime> i could
[02:19:02] <nFFF> $('span .value')
[02:19:03] <yamahaalex37> nFFF: , you think i can fairly simply detect when this slider changes?
[02:19:04] <yamahaalex37> http://entbiz.eternaware.com/index.php/music
[02:19:07] <Xotix> What reason could cause this to be called twice? http://pastebin.com/n4ZePDG4 still haven't got it. I wanted to upload it to a test server fora demo, but there it seems to work.
[02:19:21] <nFFF> $('span .value').each(function() {
[02:19:58] <sahana> anyone tried calling fancybox from     javascript?
[02:20:13] <LordThumper> sahana: yeah
[02:20:17] <nFFF> $('span .value').each(function() { $(this).attr('value') == 'true') { $(this).attr('value', ' '); } });
[02:20:31] <LordThumper> sahana: I will make you a demo on jsfiddle if you want
[02:20:51] <Carlitta87> someprimetime oh it was u...lol
[02:20:55] <sahana> yes please!!
[02:21:10] <someprimetime> what?
[02:22:14] <nFFF> yamahaalex37, look into .on()
[02:22:30] <someprimetime> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/26/
[02:22:32] <someprimetime> there we go
[02:22:34] <someprimetime> good call thanks
[02:22:35] <LordThumper> sahana: ok one mo
[02:22:44] <someprimetime> think i should be using a class instead?
[02:22:46] <someprimetime> and add/remove that
[02:22:48] <someprimetime> or an id
[02:23:19] <nFFF> yamahaalex37, if not use DOM mutation - stadnard javascript
[02:23:24] <nFFF> document.documentElement.addEventListener
[02:23:36] <yamahaalex37> k thanks
[02:24:07] <nFFF> someprimetime, why are you using find? and not just normal selectors?
[02:24:24] <nFFF> Ah so it only finds wihtin container
[02:24:30] <someprimetime> yeah
[02:24:36] <nFFF> Ok I understand
[02:24:59] <nFFF> I don't think it matters much
[02:25:23] <Carlitta87> someprimetime: i didnt realize u asked the bot
[02:25:35] <someprimetime> Carlitta87: ah gotcha
[02:25:45] <Carlitta87> someprimetime: but... for that animation
[02:25:52] <Carlitta87> how wud i place the images
[02:26:06] <wil2> ... I am going crazy! Haven't done Jquery in a few months and I feel like I have forgotten a lot - why isn't this working? http://jsfiddle.net/u5fu4/
[02:26:13] <someprimetime> you'd crop all the images out in photoshop first so you'd have like 5 of them for each of the elements
[02:26:17] <someprimetime> then you'd put each one into a span
[02:26:27] <someprimetime> from there you'd z-index each one accordingly
[02:26:39] <someprimetime> so you get that layered effect
[02:26:58] <someprimetime> then position them absolutely within a relatively positioned main container element
[02:27:21] <someprimetime> on hover of that main container element, you'd set up animate() for what you want to move
[02:27:39] <someprimetime> so in the end it'll be a lot of css and a little bit of jquery (namely animate() and hover())
[02:28:23] <nFFF> someprimetime, it would be interesting to see the perforamcne differences if any of using the normal jquery selectors over find
[02:28:58] <someprimetime> nFFF: well i mean $('span .value') is the same thing as $('span').find('.value')
[02:29:01] <someprimetime> if that's what you mean
[02:29:13] <nFFF> Yea is it exactly the same?
[02:29:16] <someprimetime> yep
[02:30:07] <someprimetime> man i want some berry kix
[02:31:28] <nFFF> someprimetime
[02:31:29] <nFFF> http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-find-again
[02:31:33] <nFFF> selector is faster
[02:31:46] <nFFF> probably not going to make any real world difference though
[02:32:07] <someprimetime> yeah
[02:32:30] <someprimetime> i remember Eviltwin talking about this and saying the performance degradation was negligible
[02:33:18] <nFFF> I guess it makes for good habit though
[02:34:18] <jimmysparkle> if i have a jquery element (checkbox) - how do I check if if it's checked - I know there are ways of doing this via a selector - however I just want to call a function and check?
[02:34:58] <jimmysparkle> would I do attr('checked') or val() ?
[02:37:48] <LordThumper> Is there an alternative to jsfiddle, it is VERY slow atm
[02:38:17] <blackspotwiggins> LordThumper, jsbin.com
[02:38:32] <Taloncor> jimmysparkle: context please :)
[02:39:14] <blackspotwiggins> jimmysparkle, domelement.checked

[02:41:00] <varnie> good day.
[02:41:01] <coldhead> often that's enough
[02:41:31] <varnie> what could prevent my popup window from being opened in IE6/7?
[02:41:53] <blackspotwiggins> varnie, script error maybe?
[02:41:54] <varnie> the screen turns gray at that moment and it doesn't pop up.
[02:42:03] <varnie> very may be)
[02:42:39] <varnie> but it is weird, because it works in firefox etc

[02:49:04] <kawohi> so it's dead?
[02:49:22] <xec> wil2: you have a "." after the $ sign
[02:49:31] <IgnisDiabolus> who's dead?
[02:49:57] <xec> wil2: try $(".search-input") rather than $.(".search-input")
[02:50:20] <kawohi> okay, well i'm having trouble! I'm trying to alert each attribute in a string but it no works! :(
[02:50:30] <kawohi> can you check it out? http://jsbin.com/ekufeb/8
[02:50:57] <kawohi> click get code
[02:51:10] <IgnisDiabolus> each attribute?
[02:51:18] <wil2> @xec - trying now
[02:51:49] <IgnisDiabolus> attribute of what?
[02:51:52] <xec> wil2: also, use # when selecting on ID, not . (which is for classes)
[02:52:15] <IgnisDiabolus> is this even jquery?
[02:52:21] <kawohi> each attribute thats of span's thats in the #group-wrap
[02:52:24] <wil2> @xec - http://jsfiddle.net/u5fu4/5/ didn't work... ok, trying #
[02:52:36] <kawohi> I tried alert($('group').attr('title')); didn't work.
[02:52:40] <elmargol> Hi I try to make a dialog or overlay div that lets me edit a value of a list item. What is the best way to do this?
[02:52:46] <kawohi> hold on i messed up.. let me give you another link.
[02:52:54] <elmargol> It should wokr on mobile devices
[02:53:11] <kawohi> okay dokey! http://jsbin.com/ekufeb/9
[02:53:24] <IgnisDiabolus> kawohi, would be better to create a case in jsfiddle.net
[02:53:34] <kawohi> okay, one sec!
[02:53:42] <kawohi> jsfiddle just seems so slow to me! :3
[02:55:11] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: why would you do that in the first place?
[02:55:56] <IgnisDiabolus> kawohi, http://jsfiddle.net/B9QeK/
[02:55:59] <kawohi> okaay! here http://jsfiddle.net/mEF4c/
[02:56:02] <kawohi> oh
[02:56:09] <IgnisDiabolus> don't know why you're doing that though
[02:57:54] <kawohi> well, I'm trying to alert each value of the title attribute in one string. example: attr + '[' + attr + 'username' + attr +.... and so on.. attr being the value thats in the title attribture
[02:58:19] <kawohi> sorry for the spelling. ive been trying to work on this all night
[02:58:40] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: then instead of alerting the value just add it to a string
[02:58:47] <Hooloovoork> then alert the string after the loop is done
[02:59:17] <kawohi> example please?
[02:59:19] <Cork> or better yet, use console.log
[02:59:31] <mindis|wurk> sorry that this isn't exactly or necessarily a javascript question but does anyone have any idea how to do a div that automatically occupies as much space vertically as its parent allows?
[02:59:37] <kawohi> how would i get each attribute for each element?
[03:00:09] <Cork> mindis|wurk: position: absolute; css doesn't have a stretching solution yet
[03:00:13] <Hooloovoork> kawohi: like in that example
[03:00:15] <IgnisDiabolus> kawohi http://jsfiddle.net/B9QeK/1/
[03:00:18] <Cork> mindis|wurk: its on the way though

[03:00:47] <bot-t1> Cork, Using flexbox - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_flexbox
[03:02:40] <kawohi> i was trying to use .each, but the problem is, inbetween each attribute value, there's what each span contains. so the output would be &f(&fgroup&) &f: &f text
[03:03:30] <IgnisDiabolus> kawohi, build on my example. i'm sure you can do what you want
[03:04:28] <kawohi> i'll try!
[03:04:39] <Darsain> can I ask someone with access to native IE8 to test something? (not IETester, either OS with IE8, or virtualized OS with IE8)

[03:06:15] <IgnisDiabolus> Cork, thanks for introducing me to $.map :)
[03:06:47] <Cork> SuperPhly: something is resetting $
[03:06:59] <Cork> SuperPhly: you either need to find what or use jQuery
[03:07:11] <Darsain> SuperPhly: use jQuery(window).load(function($){ ... });
[03:07:17] <mindis|wurk> Cork thanks, flexin does appear to do the trick and since i don't have to care about compatibility that's ok :P
[03:07:27] <kawohi> this is complicated.
[03:07:37] <kawohi> im almost there though. grrr
[03:07:44] <SuperPhly> i am using jquery... :/
[03:07:49] <SuperPhly> ohhh
[03:07:50] <Xotix> How do i get the hex color code of an element?
[03:07:52] <SuperPhly> nvm, i see what you mean
[03:08:09] <Xotix> .css(color) just gives me rgb.
[03:08:11] <K3|Chris|Work> how do I get the ID of something I hover and modify something with a class with the same number?
[03:08:36] <K3|Chris|Work> say div id="500" and I want to .show() div class="500"
[03:09:23] <Cork> $('.' + $(this).attr('id')).show()
[03:09:33] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: i think you have to convery
[03:09:36] <Hooloovoork> convert*
[03:09:41] <varnie> could you help me to figure out why the following JS code doesn't give me the correct results (for centering the popup window)?  here it is: http://pastebin.com/5sfewJUv
[03:09:55] <varnie> it shows not in the center of window.
[03:10:28] <K3|Chris|Work> Cork: thanks :)
[03:10:39] <Xotix> hmm ok
[03:12:14] <sendoushi> hi guys
[03:12:29] <sendoushi> i want javascript to set a php $_SESSION, how can i do this? without using post? I was using .html() but it doesn't seem to be working
[03:12:34] <Xotix> isn't there a nice script snippet already done?
[03:13:43] <Darsain> nobody with virtualized/native IE8 ? :(
[03:13:51] <smiLLe> http://jsfiddle.net/DEEF6/1/ is there no way to capture the custom.ns event?
[03:14:44] <yamahaalex37> does this look like it should work?
[03:14:45] <yamahaalex37> if($(this).attr(value) = "3"){
[03:16:03] <Xotix> does jquery .css accept rgb?
[03:16:41] <xec> ?tias
[03:16:42] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[03:17:20] <Darsain> yamahaalex37: values should be retrieved with .val(), otherwise it's ok
[03:17:57] <xec> yamahaalex37: for comparison use "==="
[03:18:00] <Darsain> oh, you need "==", not "="
[03:18:03] <xec> yamahaalex37: "=" is for assignment
[03:18:05] <Darsain> yeah
[03:18:21] <yamahaalex37> hmm
[03:18:26] <yamahaalex37> this is working: alert($(this).attr("value"));
[03:18:37] <yamahaalex37> but this is not: if($(this).attr("value") === "3"){
[03:19:18] <smiLLe> if($(this).attr("value") === parseInt("3", 10)) ??
[03:19:41] <yamahaalex37> oh i see, I had to drop the quotes
[03:19:50] <yamahaalex37> "3" was a int i guess, so === 3 worked
[03:23:01] <xec> yamahaalex37: you can use typeof to check, like: console.log(typeof this.value)
[03:23:19] <yamahaalex37> nice, thanks, im still new i wouldnt of even thought to
[03:23:44] <ServerSage> What is the difference between == and ===?
[03:23:53] <yamahaalex37> syntax still kills me, php/js are quite different from c
[03:23:54] <xec> ServerSage: type conversion
[03:23:56] <yamahaalex37> c# i mean
[03:24:20] <xec> ServerSage: in short == can produce strange unexpected results ;)
[03:24:24] <ServerSage> xec: Aaah, makes sense.  Thanks.
[03:27:16] <LordThumper> tbh js syntax feels very similar to c# to me
[03:28:03] <yamahaalex37> i suppose thats true, php can be a bit awkward tho
[03:28:06] <xec> well, the syntax is based on c, as is c#'s
[03:29:15] <LordThumper> Feel very comfortable switching coding server-side/client-side
[03:29:34] <LordThumper> Can even use var in c# now
[03:29:37] <caiogondim> does anyone knows the channel of LessCSS?
[03:30:04] <Djj> Can someone explain why I would be receiving the following error in firebug: $("#calendar").fullCalendar is not a function. I've followed the basic steps from the jquery fullcalendar and is not working for some reason. http://pastie.org/3333695
[03:31:00] <xec> Djj: looks like you're including the fullcalendar.min.js before jquery
[03:31:01] <smiLLe> include calendar after jquery
[03:31:06] <LordThumper> ^^
[03:31:13] <smiLLe> first :P
[03:31:20] <xec> not on my screen =(
[03:31:29] <LordThumper> lol
[03:32:09] <Djj> xec: Cheers, such a school boy error.
[03:32:21] <xec> np :)
[03:32:38] <xec> smiLLe: i got the street creds!
[03:32:48] <smiLLe> -,-
[03:32:51] <smiLLe> btw http://jsfiddle.net/DEEF6/1/
[03:33:11] <smiLLe> i never receive custom.ns
[03:33:45] <smiLLe> is there no way to capture all custom* events?
[03:35:22] <xec> smiLLe: i thought they worked the other way around
[03:35:47] <smiLLe> ?
[03:36:07] <xec> smiLLe: like you would listen to custom.ns and it would fire on both .trigger("custom") and .trigger("custom.ns")
[03:37:06] <smiLLe> xec: mhm bad
[03:37:31] <xec> smiLLe: you could listen to two event namespaces by declaring them both though http://jsfiddle.net/DEEF6/2/
[03:38:56] <smiLLe> xec: need wildcard events :D thanks
[04:04:07] <gregoryLwD> I have a strange problem
[04:05:04] <gregoryLwD> a $(this)....show() call only takes affect on a certain item once I do right click, inspect in chrome.
[04:05:40] <gregoryLwD> the same(not copy) code works instantly on other items
[04:17:18] <aranw> Hello
[04:18:42] <gregoryLwD> Hi aranw
[04:18:46] <aranw> I've found a bug with the following http://jsfiddle.net/NMcyS/
[04:19:06] <aranw> wondering if anyone can help me out with it
[04:19:29] <gregoryLwD> aranw, at the end of the function add a line: return false;
[04:19:53] <Cork> prevent default should work too
[04:19:59] <gregoryLwD> I've found that works better than preventDefault, but I didn't really understand why
[04:20:07] <aranw> that doesn't fix the bug though
[04:20:34] <aranw> the bug is that when you click the link with a image
[04:20:38] <aranw> it returns undefined
[04:22:46] <Taloncor> aranw: Thats due the fact that the item clicked is the image and not the link
[04:23:12] <aranw> so do I need to add a href to img tag?
[04:23:56] <Taloncor> What exactly are u trying to do?
[04:24:11] <aranw> The code is to be used with iOS web apps
[04:24:19] <aranw> cause when you add a website to the home screen
[04:24:29] <aranw> and you click the link
[04:24:41] <aranw> it opens safari up and takes you away from the page your currently on
[04:24:50] <aranw> using the JS you can stay within the web app
[04:24:59] <aranw> and not get taken out too jQuery
[04:25:34] <aranw> out too Safari*\
[04:26:24] <Taloncor> You could also bind an eventhandler for images
[04:26:33] <Taloncor> or find the first <a>-item
[04:27:35] <aranw> hmm yeah
[04:28:03] <Cork> aranw: the href is on $(this) not $(e.target)
[04:29:21] <aranw> Cork: Doh! Thanks a lot. I took the code from a another website, wish I spotted that before.
[04:29:51] <Cork> aranw: delegate uses the correct this for th bounded selector
[04:30:07] <Cork> (the syntax your using is a delegated event)
[04:30:44] <yamahaalex37> is this valid? $(".readmore_sliderii a")
[04:30:51] <Cork> yes
[04:30:53] <yamahaalex37> with a space between the class and type
[04:30:57] <yamahaalex37> ok
[04:31:23] <Cork> its an a link tag that has the .redmore_sliderii in its parent chain
[04:32:16] <Cork> hmm jsfiddle is really borked today... >_>
[04:32:37] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to link to an area of a page with the class name?
[04:32:44] <yamahaalex37> $(".readmore_sliderii a").attr("href", ".leading-0")
[04:32:58] <Cork> link to?
[04:33:11] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[04:33:16] <yamahaalex37> you know how you can link to areas of pages with #idName
[04:33:21] <yamahaalex37> like scroll down the page
[04:33:32] <Cork> no you need id's for that
[04:33:42] <yamahaalex37> really theres no way?
[04:33:43] <Cork> you can scroll to an element based on a class name though
[04:33:46] <yamahaalex37> what about with a special jquery slider?
[04:33:53] <kawohi> burp.
[04:33:53] <yamahaalex37> oh ok
[04:33:55] <yamahaalex37> thats what i need
[04:34:33] <Cork> ?mdc window.scrollTo
[04:34:35] <bot-t1> Cork, window.scrollTo - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Scrolls to a particular set of coordinates in the document. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.scrollTo
[04:34:53] <Cork> oh ya, it takes cortinats...
[04:34:58] <Cork> ?.scrollTo
[04:34:59] <bot-t1> Cork, plugins.jquery.com - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[04:35:12] <Cork> yamahaalex37: thats what you want ^
[04:35:20] <Cork> gives you nice animations and things like that
[04:36:17] <yamahaalex37> awesome thanks Cork
[04:36:35] <Cork> np
[04:36:36] <yamahaalex37> so i will probably need to break the url with href = "", then just use a click function with scroll?
[04:36:44] <Dirkos> how can i find all registered listeners on an element in 1.7?
[04:44:17] <yamahaalex37> is there any way I can set $("a").attr("href", "$.scrollTo(.myclass);")
[04:44:21] <yamahaalex37> or something like that
[04:44:54] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: you'd have to do that as a event
[04:44:56] <Kuni> If I capture the right button per mousedown, how do I block the contextmenu without blocking it for the complete document? .preventDefault() does not seem to work in this case
[04:45:22] <Hooloovoork> like $("a").bind("click", function() { $.scrollTo(".yourclass") })
[04:45:40] <Kuni> here is my jsfiddle test case: http://jsfiddle.net/NPGEZ/
[04:45:59] <yamahaalex37> oh ok Hooloovoork
[04:46:05] <yamahaalex37> the problem is, a has a href="value"
[04:46:19] <yamahaalex37> if i set href = "", it still does link , and reloads the page
[04:46:27] <yamahaalex37> although it reloads the same page
[04:46:34] <yamahaalex37> can i return false or something to completely kill that link
[04:46:47] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: kk, so do this then. $("a").bind("click", function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); $.scrollTo(".yourclass") })
[04:47:13] <Cork> Dirkos: $._data(elm).events
[04:47:31] <thomas> hello.
[04:47:50] <thomas> have a $('#givenName').val() and $('#sn').val() (firs- and lastname)
[04:48:33] <thomas> i would like the first letter from the givenName then a point and then the lastname, in lowercase
[04:48:44] <thomas> example "Max Jquery" in m.jquery
[04:48:46] <thomas> is it posible?
[04:49:01] <Hooloovoork> thomas: yes
[04:49:08] <thomas> Hooloovoork: can you tell me please, how?  :-)
[04:49:35] <yamahaalex37> Hooloovoork: that was a huge help, your a genious
[04:50:06] <Hooloovoork> thomas: var a = $("#givenName").substr(0, 1) + "." + $("#sn").val()
[04:50:11] <Hooloovoork> thomas: that should work
[04:50:15] <thomas> $('#givenName').val().substring(0,1)
[04:50:23] <thomas> oh, not with "val" ?
[04:50:25] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: oh well thank you! and np =P
[04:50:26] <Hooloovoork> thomas: wops
[04:50:31] <Hooloovoork> thomas: right, val too.
[04:50:37] <thomas> Hooloovoork: and as lowercases?
[04:50:46] <thomas> from "M.Jquery" to "m.jquery" ?
[04:50:59] <Hooloovoork> a.toLowerCase()
[04:51:06] <Hooloovoork> after you set a
[04:51:06] <thomas>  oki
[04:51:43] <Cork> ?eval var a = ["Max", "Jquery"]; a[0].slice(0,1).toUpperCase() + '.' + a[1].toLowerCase()
[04:51:59] <thomas> Cork: what is slice?
[04:52:04] <thomas> substring i know but sliace?
[04:52:09] <Cork> it grabs a range in the string
[04:52:19] <thomas> but booth is okay
[04:52:23] <Cork> ya
[04:52:37] <Cork> substring is option => length
[04:52:42] <Cork> slice is start end position
[04:53:02] <Cork> *position => length -_-'
[04:53:19] <Cork> thats the sign when you've written too much select options...
[04:53:54] <Hooloovoork> you need a vacation
[04:53:57] <thomas> Cork: a last question
[04:54:00] <thomas> i have now: $('#givenName').keyup(function(event) {
[04:54:11] <thomas> is it posible to say when $('#givenName').keyup(function(event) { OR $('#sn').keyup(function(event) {
[04:54:29] <thomas> or i need booth keyups seperat?
[04:54:38] <Hooloovoork> thomas: have a common selector for them
[04:54:51] <thomas> common selector?
[04:54:53] <Cork> thomas: $('#givenName, #sn').keyup(function(event) {
[04:54:57] <thomas> oh ok
[04:54:58] <quicksilver> $('#givenName, #sn').keyup(...)
[04:55:07] <thomas> easy
[04:55:16] <quicksilver> you can also give the function a name and just use it twice.
[04:55:42] <thomas> super, thanks Hooloovoork and cork
[04:56:17] <yamahaalex37> Hooloovoork: , i am really happy with that effect: http://entbiz.eternaware.com/index.php/music
[04:56:25] <yamahaalex37> wen you click a contract, then Read More
[04:56:43] <yamahaalex37> BUT, wtf is going on here, (try doing it a few times)
[04:57:07] <yamahaalex37> its like each scrollTo is saved in memory, when I do a nother one, it pauses on the previous one for a moment, then continues
[04:57:24] <yamahaalex37> if i do #7, then #1, it flys down to #7 then back up to #1!
[04:59:10] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: looks nice =9
[04:59:24] <yamahaalex37> thanks, the scroll is awesome
[04:59:39] <yamahaalex37> but i dont understand whats happening, its like each scroll is stored in memory
[04:59:47] <yamahaalex37> it hovers over each previous scrolled item for a moment
[04:59:56] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: hmm, maybe it saves the scroll position or something
[04:59:58] <Hooloovoork> gimme a sec
[05:01:38] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: i'd prolly write that a bit differently
[05:01:52] <Hooloovoork> you bind a click on a click event
[05:01:54] <yamahaalex37> hmm really?
[05:02:07] <Hooloovoork> $('.li_height_item_98').click(function(e){
[05:02:16] <Hooloovoork> in that callback function is where you bind all of your events
[05:02:26] <Hooloovoork> so the same button is getting stacked up with eventlisteners
[05:02:43] <yamahaalex37> so this button should go up one line? above the if?
[05:02:44] <yamahaalex37> $(".readmore_sliderii a").bind("click", function(ev) { $.scrollTo(".leading-0", 500) })
[05:02:49] <yamahaalex37> i meant this line *
[05:03:16] <Hooloovoork> separate the part that changes the contact and the part that does the scrolling
[05:03:19] <Kuni> is it possible to block the context menu when a right-button event is fired? http://jsfiddle.net/NPGEZ/
[05:04:07] <Cork> Kuni: you need to do what you do in the commented out code
[05:04:25] <blaster> is there a way to undo the changes you did on a mouse over upon doing a mouse out?
[05:04:32] <Kuni> so it can only be blocked for the complete document?
[05:04:45] <Cork> blaster: do the changes through addClass
[05:04:49] <Cork> then use removeClass
[05:05:10] <Cork> Kuni: oh, no just bind the contextmenu event on the element you care about
[05:05:44] <Cork> Kuni: http://jsfiddle.net/NPGEZ/1/
[05:06:18] <Kuni> ... okay, thanks, that was kinda obvious
[05:06:30] <Cork> heh kinda :)
[05:06:48] <blaster> how do you decide whether to use mouseout or mouseleave?
[05:06:51] <Kuni> never occurred to me to just change the element, somehow ;)
[05:06:57] <yamahaalex37> Hooloovoork: , im not sure i can do that
[05:07:14] <yamahaalex37> because the change contract event changes which Read More button is presented
[05:07:24] <Cork> blaster: if the element has sub element you don't want to trigger the event, use mouseleave
[05:07:27] <yamahaalex37> so the bind event has to be after or inside the change contract egent
[05:08:18] <Hooloovoork> yamahaalex37: sorry i can't really help rewrite it atm, but make a fiddle and i'm sure someone will come up with a solution
[05:08:28] <Hooloovoork> problem is too many event listeners tho
[05:08:31] <Topcat> hey, I'm having a horrid time trying to get 2 jquerys working in drupal. I get  initial.scripts.js:23 Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'waterwheelCarousel'  at every turn. http://www.stbedes-ormskirk.lancs.sch.uk/ Can someone else sort this out ?
[05:08:47] <blaster> Cork:  Thanks... how would you go about binding a fadeIn/animate with addClass?
[05:08:56] <yamahaalex37> ok thanks Hooloovoork
[05:09:27] <Cork> blaster: fadein is simple, but animate is more problematic
[05:09:50] <Cork> blaster: jquery-ui has it, but its way WAY to much code to just add that
[05:10:36] <blaster> so you can just do fadeIn with addClass?
[05:10:40] <blaster> chain them?
[05:11:29] <Cork> $(elm).addClass('some-class').fadeIn('slow', function() { $(elm).addClass('some-other-class') });
[05:11:50] <Cork> blaster: depending on what you want to do
[05:12:01] <blaster> ohh i see
[05:12:03] <blaster> thank you
[05:12:09] <Cork> np
[05:14:20] <blaster> what if when you click on an element you no longer want the removeclass to take place upon mouseout?
[05:15:08] <yamahaalex37> why do i need ev in .click(function(ev)
[05:17:04] <blaster> yamahaalex37: ev.preventDefault(); would prevent default browser behavior
[05:17:59] <yamahaalex37> blaster: , i am using it, but its still buggin out
[05:18:51] <Cork> blaster: you could add an extra class on it
[05:19:11] <Cork> blaster: and either not trigger the event with that class, or filter it in the event
[05:19:38] <Trudko> guys it is faster or slower if I instead of using selector id starting with ([id^ = i specify elemenet type e.g. table[id^=...
[05:20:18] <Cork> Trudko: it is, faster as the original selector will match fewer elements
[05:20:43] <Trudko> ok so if I know I should specify type of element Cork?!
[05:20:52] <Cork> though attribute selectors should be used sparsly, as they are really slow
[05:21:06] <Cork> Trudko: or add a class instead
[05:21:54] <Trudko> Cork yes, that is also good idea.
[05:22:20] <Cork> Trudko: the rule of thumb is to only use attribute selectors to filter results
[05:22:37] <Trudko> what results?
[05:22:40] <Cork> that is you have x number of elements your working with, but only want something to happen to a small part o them
[05:22:44] <JAAulde> You should use class carefully as well since in many deployed browsers it is as slow as attr selectors
[05:22:59] <Cork> Trudko: as in: don't use it as a selector to find elements
[05:23:06] <JKarsrud> JAAulde: data on that?
[05:23:28] <Trudko> Cork: JAAulde ok I will have to take a look into this deeper.
[05:23:29] <Browser> Hello, i cant avoid the submit on the form. My code is: http://pastebin.com/97pa0jxD
[05:23:32] <Cork> Trudko: as attribute selectors needs to select all elements that the previus selectors match, and then check each one of them
[05:23:37] <JAAulde> JKarsrud: don't have a link at the moment, but it's just a fact in IE
[05:23:51] <yamahaalex37> should I use === for integers also
[05:23:53] <Cork> JAAulde: thats not true
[05:24:03] <JAAulde> class and attr selectors should be contained within a specific context, or used for filtering
[05:24:04] <JKarsrud> JAAulde: I kinda doubt that
[05:24:14] <Cork> JAAulde: classes is actually almost as fast as id's in even farly modern browsers
[05:24:27] <JKarsrud> newer IE versions have no problem with classes compared to attribute selectors
[05:24:55] <JAAulde> I didn't say newer
[05:25:09] <JAAulde> I specifically mentioned deployed browsers
[05:25:22] <JKarsrud> well, IE6&7 have shitty performance anyway, so it's not like it's gonna matter much
[05:25:26] <Cork> as in farly new is browsers thats supported
[05:26:00] <yamahaalex37> should I use === for integers also
[05:26:17] <Cork> if the values are the same type, yes
[05:26:26] <JKarsrud> yamahaalex37: yes
[05:26:31] <Cork> as in not '1' == 1
[05:26:44] <yamahaalex37> if 3 === 3
[05:26:48] <JKarsrud> yes
[05:27:38] <Topcat> if theres 2 jquerys, how do i make sure a plugin uses just a specific version
[05:28:14] <Cork> ?.noConflict @ Topcat
[05:28:14] <bot-t> Topcat, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[05:28:24] <Cork> especially check its return value
[05:29:45] <Browser> Hello, i cant avoid the submit on the form. My code is: http://pastebin.com/97pa0jxD  Could anyone help me?
[05:30:01] <JAAulde> Cork, JKarsrud: per http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/, class selectors use getElementsByClassName() if the browser supports it.  Per http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html IE <=8 does not support it
[05:30:42] <Browser> I`ve tryed with evet.preventDefault() y return false
[05:31:13] <JKarsrud> JAAulde: no, but IE8 does support querySelectorAll
[05:31:34] <JKarsrud> but I don't remember if the performance on that is as good as getElementsByClassName tho
[05:34:26] <JAAulde> Even if it is, IE7 is still widely deployed. So on a real application (not just a couple of scripts on a page) class selectors are problematic for performance.  They should be used, like attr selectors, in limited context or in filtatrion methods.
[05:34:34] <Topcat> so do i load 1 library then oldver = $.noConflict and load the second library. then I can oldver(document).ready(function ($){ $.stuff
[05:35:29] <Xotix> I have some content, you can edit it.  Some css classes control what you can edit. i save the whole thing very simple into a db. if you don't close the browser and just reload the page (pull it from the db) is it possible, that some event handler are going to be attached twice or something like that?
[05:35:56] <Cork> Topcat: that or you load both and do newjquery = $.noConflict(true);
[05:36:08] <Cork> Topcat: and then $ is the old one and newjquery is the new one
[05:36:47] <Topcat> Cork: ok what I'm getting my head around is if theres 2 JQ's loaded will newjquery = $.noConflict(true); // $. will mean the last one loaded?
[05:37:11] <Cork> it will untill the noConflict is run
[05:37:17] <Cork> then its the old one
[05:37:42] <yamahaalex37> thank you very much again Hooloovoork , seperating those events solved all problems
[05:37:47] <mantas322> Hi
[05:37:52] <Cork> Topcat: that said, if posible you should try to not use multible versions of jquery, it has a tendency to cause problems
[05:38:12] <Topcat> Cork: i'd like to not od this but it's not an option yet
[05:38:22] * Cork nods
[05:39:22] <mantas322> I have a cold fusion query which pulls some data from a database, is it possible to have the results of of this dbloop go into a jquery mobile lists-split.html control http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/#/demos/1.0.1/docs/lists/lists-split.html ???
[05:39:58] <mantas322> like the idea is I query a title an image location using coldfusion, and lay it out using jquery
[05:40:04] <mantas322> possible?
[05:40:14] <mantas322> should be right?

[05:51:56] <spines> hmm
[05:51:58] <jeffsmykil> I did it once, it got erased in SVN and now I can't figure it out again
[05:52:11] <spines> I stopped using it because of something similar if I'm not mistaken
[05:52:14] <jeffsmykil> i feel like i have tried everything
[05:52:53] <spines> I moved to either the google graphinc api or something like that
[05:53:05] <spines> if I needed graphs, because flot was pissing me off
[05:53:09] <jeffsmykil> yeah we can't use googles

[06:01:29] <Djj>  Can someone tell me if this is feasible or not... I am trying to create a time slot booking diary. Somewhat similar to http://www.phpjabbers.com/time-slots-booking-calendar/. However my initial approach is to do this using Jquery week calendar or Jquery full calendar...But with a slightly different approach.From this example file:///C:/Users/patterd/Desktop/jquery-weekcalendar-1.2.2/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html it shows the tim
[06:01:37] <nFFF> kaputtmacher, is there any benefit to asigning the selectors to a variable and doing trigger.click?
[06:02:06] <Djj> However what I am trying to achieve is that as a booking manager you can create time slots as it were, by pressing a  plus button so that it creates a new time slot for a user. Which if you think of buying tickets for a concert a "booking" manager will create "ticket slots". I am not an expert at using the jquery week calendar of fullCalendar. But am highly  wondering is something like this really feasible
[06:02:31] <Guest99772> Hi all, quick question.  I'm upgrading from jQuery 1.4.4 to 1.7.1 and it seems the default behavior has become case sensitive in identifying elements.  For simplicities sake, I had two elements <input type="Text"> and <input type="text"> that used to be caught with .filter('input[type="text"]'), now only the second is caught.  Is there a quick fix to make the filter case insensitive?  I can't change the html source, sadly.
[06:02:49] <Djj> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[06:04:38] <nFFF> Guest14334, why not just fix your class names?
[06:04:58] <nFFF> or use regex
[06:05:30] <Guest99772> We're layering query on top of an encrypted compelled ColdFusion application to make it more useable.  What I'm actually doing with this bit of the script is add a class name to any date related text input.
[06:06:50] <Guest99772> nFFF, actually, guess I should have dug a bit deeper, this seems to be covered in the jQuery documentation comments, guess I should use filter(fn).
[06:08:04] <nFFF> .filter(function() { $(this).attr('type').match(regex here); });
[06:08:56] <jeffsmykil> anyone know of a good tooltip solution that will allow you to load content with ajax?
[06:10:34] <jeffsmykil> is bootstrap currently the best solution?
[06:13:21] <caaakeeey> should i prefer var x = function(){}; or function x(){}?
[06:14:19] <chemandy> all depends

[06:26:07] <sahana> http://jsfiddle.net/YaqWc/3/ is the demo for fancybox lordthumber has given. But to adapt it for classes. If I change for class with more than one hyperlink. it does not work
[06:27:27] <Gozzy> srajbr firstoff i see your giving your li ids a numeric value thats not valid, you can use srajbrINTEGER of whichever prefix you want
[06:28:42] <srajbr> Gozzy ok i will note that but i m not facing problem with that
[06:30:08] <Gozzy> http://www.webdevout.net/test?0s
[06:30:13] <Gozzy> ok thats it
[06:30:31] <Gozzy> if i understood you correctly :)
[06:30:53] <sasori> hi, is this valid ? window.location = "<?php echo 'http:/blahblahblah'; ?>"  ..
[06:31:08] <sasori> i mean putting the php script ?
[06:31:29] <Gozzy> sure javascript only sees your echoed value
[06:33:03] <Gozzy> you can dump the "s it will come out as window.location = "'http:/blahblahblah';" now
[06:35:25] <sasori> you mean echo http://blahblah is enough ?
[06:35:45] <sasori> or you're referring to the double quotation marks that encloses the php script ?
[06:40:02] <fragy> Hi. What kind of variable is this? $$.variable
[06:40:26] <Gozzy> the latter
[06:40:55] <Gozzy> @sasori

[08:06:04] <jarr0dsz> only requirement its clean and it can load external content with ajax and no jquery ui
[08:06:07] <jarr0dsz> what would be the best option then
[08:07:27] <Hooloovoork> anphonic: more like what?
[08:07:57] <anphonic> for itterating over each image in the specified div. I'm needing to wrap each in link

[08:11:31] <dddbmt> I am using jquery UI datepicker. I want to be able to open two datepickers (from, to) by the click of a button, each linked to it's own input field.
[08:11:33] <Exnor> hey, is there any way to 'edit' or 'add' to a current bound event, like onmouseover?
[08:11:33] <dddbmt> Any ideas?
[08:16:04] <pifantastic> dddbmt: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#method-show
[08:16:17] <pifantastic> Exnor: You can bind an additional event handler
[08:16:40] <Exnor> using a seperate event?
[08:16:54] <Exnor> is it simply using .bind?
[08:17:54] <sysadmin4hire> Why does this only work on my first textbox and not the ones created by the js? http://pastebin.com/iVk1JkMM
[08:19:37] <dddbmt> pifantastic, alright, thanks. guess I can tweak it enough.

[08:22:11] <pifantastic> $('.box input').live('blur', handleblur).parent().data('created', false)
[08:22:47] <sysadmin4hire> ah. i see.
[08:23:09] <sysadmin4hire> and this allows it to be applied for all elements that jquery has already worked on or created?
[08:23:43] <sysadmin4hire> dangit. nope :(
[08:23:49] <sysadmin4hire> i must be doing something wrong here.
[08:25:35] <Exnor> pifantastic: any idea how to actually pull that off? Simply assigning an additional event to it seems to overwrite the original
[08:27:22] <pifantastic> ?p @ Exnor
[08:27:23] <bot-t> Exnor, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:28:01] <pifantastic> sysadmin4hire: the created elements have to still match that selector
[08:28:26] <Exnor> pifantastic: will create a test case, is a little more complex as i'm using jstestdriver and a wrapper that basically emulates qUnit.. give me a couple of mins
[08:32:25] <qom2> http://emilolsson.com/shop/demo/layers <- anyone know a scroll script that works similar to this?

[08:45:00] <pifantastic> anphonic: it's too hard for me to dig through your live example page and know what you are talking about. If you want help, it's better if you use jsfiddle to recreate a minimal test case.
[08:45:09] <pifantastic> oh
[08:45:11] <dddbmt> pifantastic, seems like console.log() print is as string. If I alert it I get the correct Date object.
[08:45:12] <pifantastic> and I see you did that
[08:45:25] <anphonic> pifantastic: I did :) as simple as I can get it
[08:45:50] <anphonic> one sec, i forgot to revert it to default
[08:45:52] <pifantastic> anphonic: can you make it functional please?
[08:46:05] <pifantastic> that's not including jquery or even valid javascript
[08:47:28] <yannickoo> anyone?
[08:47:45] <pifantastic> yannickoo: https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel
[08:47:51] <pifantastic> I usually use something like that ^
[08:48:11] <pifantastic> but you may be able to do the same with some jQuery queue magic
[08:51:37] <anphonic> pifantastic: working on it, jsfiddle is giving me jQuery is not defined.
[08:52:13] <pifantastic> anphonic: look at the left sidebar
[08:52:18] <pifantastic> you have to explicity load jQuery
[08:52:28] <Aristata> Does this demo page work for anybody else? http://david-tang.net/plugins/feedback/feedback.html
[08:52:46] <anphonic> ^_^ thanks, forgot, been banging my head against the wall and my brain hurts

[08:54:58] <jedimind> what is that supposed to be doing?
[08:55:02] <pifantastic> Aristata: it's open source, how's about you dig in there and fix it?
[08:55:27] <jedimind> why do you need a plugin for that ?
[08:55:48] <Aristata> pifantastic:  I wish I had the time
[08:55:54] <Aristata> jedimind:  I don't have the time
[08:56:12] <Aristata> Why would you not use pre built libraries if they suit your needs?
[08:58:12] <amccloud> console.log(field.parent().addClass('error')); -> <div class="input-field"></div> Why isn't the class being added to the div?
[08:58:20] <jedimind> because they generally are bloated compared to your immediate usage
[08:58:32] <jedimind> and ontop of which, fixing and implementing them is generally a longer task than just writing it yousrelf
[08:58:38] <jedimind> how long have you beeen in this channel? :)
[08:58:49] <anphonic> pifantastic: I also am going to need to remove duplicate images, but I haven't even made it to starting on that yet
[08:59:20] <DerekPioneer> general question, but don't know where to start. i have something that looks like: "$('.s7url').attr('src',url);"   how do i load this url and display a spinning loading gif while waiting?
[08:59:40] <Aristata> jedimind:  I have never had problems with a plugin that were not fixable in around 10 minutes.
[09:01:53] <mordof> I've got an ajax page setup, and I'm using the jquery-ui dialog. My question is when I change a page, I'm using the destroy, and then create again on the same element ID (which has changed since page update), however it's displaying peculiar behavior. Is that not supposed to be used that way?

[09:14:46] <anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/uQBmt/3/  how do I get this to wrap each image in one link and the href be the source?
[09:15:31] <anphonic> as is, the images are wrapped in links, up to the number of links inside the parent div. All links href to the first image
[09:24:46] <jarr0dsz> hey guys i have this code modaltop:eleposition.top,
[09:24:56] <jarr0dsz> then i have to set a value but modaltop:eleposition.top, 400
[09:25:08] <jarr0dsz> or 400, anyone any idea what would be the right syntax?
[09:26:01] <zCoder> Any js/jquery/php experts in here looking for a project? PM me.
[09:29:10] <xec> jarr0dsz: that doesn't look like jquery code to me - too little quotes and brackets and dollar signs!
[09:29:34] <jarr0dsz> xec: yes its jquery code i shall pastie it all i got from  a blog with incomplete description on how exactly to edit
[09:29:45] <xec> ?demo @ jarr0dsz
[09:29:45] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:31:40] <idr0p> hey how do i select all the even imgs in a div? $("div > img:even")?
[09:31:51] <jarr0dsz> xec: this is it : http://jsfiddle.net/xXx88/ its line         modaltop: eleposition.top,100,
[09:32:07] <jarr0dsz> i only need to know how i should set that value after .top,
[09:33:01] <idr0p> of it is $(div#img even)?
[09:33:04] <xec> jarr0dsz: after top? you mean add to it?
[09:33:25] <jarr0dsz>  modaltop: eleposition.top,100, <- thats incorrect i mean what the correct syntax would need to be
[09:33:49] <xec> idr0p: the first attempt looks closer
[09:33:57] <kborchers> jarr0dsz: two things, first, what should that 100 do? second, don't use live
[09:34:24] <jarr0dsz> it should be for positioning the modal box it generates
[09:34:33] <jarr0dsz> http://www.ppc.bz/fbmodal/ wayy below
[09:34:54] <jarr0dsz> there is some description on how to use it for dynamic placement, dont make lots of sense to me, perhaps it can be done betteR?
[09:35:00] <pringlescan> Hello all. I'm bind('change', function() {}) to a select box… It's not called when the default value is selected. I need a way of firing an event even when the default value is changed. Click behaves very differently between Gecko and Webkit so I'd like to know if there is an alternative?
[09:36:33] <kborchers> jarr0dsz: so are you trying to add 100 to modaltop or set it to 100?
[09:36:56] <jarr0dsz> kborchers: no i want to make it move on the screen if you resize the window of your browser
[09:37:02] <jarr0dsz> not sure if facebook does that, does it?
[09:37:13] <jarr0dsz> kinda hate facebook i have no account any "insiders" know ;p
[09:37:33] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone knows how to group every 15 div.Item into a div? php outputs the divs, I can't group them that way
[09:38:03] <K3|Chris|Work> so if I have 16 divs I want the first 15 to be wrapped in a div, and 16:th either solo or in another one of those divs
[09:38:12] <kborchers> jarr0dsz: ok, then you'll probably need to reinitialize the plugin on the resize event see ?resize
[09:38:12] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[09:39:23] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: $(":nth-of-type(div)").appendTo(".myDiv") <-- wild guess
[09:39:38] <xec> errrr
[09:40:00] <jarr0dsz> okay thx i look into it try it out
[09:40:18] <xec> div:nth-of-type(15) <-- another wild guess
[09:40:39] <xec> 15n perhaps
[09:41:07] <EBisumaru> Hey guys, this isn't really related to jQuery, but maybe some of you are familiar - does anyone know a good chatroom for IE quirks?
[09:41:26] <EBisumaru> um, i mean channel, sorry
[09:43:12] <devmikey> Anybody know a jquery gallery plugin that works with MOV files?
[09:44:11] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/dXcyx/ <-- woot
[09:44:53] <xec> i know, i misunderstood the question
[09:46:09] <sysadmin4hire> Ok - so I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/CgfZ6/ I need to have the "creation of new elements" ONLY happen with the textboxes
[09:46:20] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: is this what you meant? http://jsfiddle.net/dXcyx/1/
[09:48:03] <xec> sysadmin4hire: that's an awful lot of code for a question that is so short, and seemingly unrelated?
[09:48:27] <cers> hi, I have 3 lists, and I want to be able to move elements from #1 to #2, and from #2 to #3, each time, they should be added to the bottom of the list they are added to - what would be the best way to do this?
[09:49:07] <K3|Chris|Work> xec: yeah nice, but is it possible to not have an empty div/p in the code?
[09:49:25] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: of course, just put it in to demonstrate
[09:49:41] <K3|Chris|Work> is it possible to make it work for an unknown number of items?
[09:49:46] <sysadmin4hire> xec: what?
[09:49:59] <xec> sysadmin4hire: thats exactly what i was thinking too
[09:50:31] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: umm, what do you mean - like every div except the last?
[09:51:25] <anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/uQBmt/3/  how do I get this to wrap each image in one link and the href be the source?
[09:51:31] <anphonic> as is, the images are wrapped in links, up to the number of links inside the parent div. All links href to the first image
[09:51:48] <devmikey> Anybody know a jquery gallery plugin that works with MOV files?
[09:52:42] <sysadmin4hire> xec: when I clicky out of the textbox - I would like it to create a new set of elements - the drop down box and textbox... (aka blur)... right now, if i blur on the dropdown boxes, it creates new elements, I only want to apply the blur to textboxes.
[09:52:46] <K3|Chris|Work> xec: no every 15 items
[09:52:49] <xec> i must be getting tired, i don't understand any of the four last questions
[09:53:23] <K3|Chris|Work> so with 50 you get 15 15 15 5
[09:53:37] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: ah i see
[09:53:55] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: you would need to loop through them
[09:53:57] <xec> i think
[09:55:09] <ezioa> can someone check this out and tell me what you think is wrong: http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/comment/30433#Comment_30433

[10:15:09] <devmikey> Anybody know a jquery gallery plugin that works with MOV files?
[10:15:51] <xec> devmikey: mov files are quicktime, right?
[10:16:00] <devmikey> yes
[10:16:15] <dddbmt> It seems like $().datepicker('show') hides all other datepicker instances before showing. Is there a way to prevent that?
[10:17:00] <Emn1ty> anyone know why this isn't working? http://jsbin.com/ipejaz/edit#javascript
[10:17:49] <xec> devmikey: you would need a plugin in order to view mov files, so, a javascript gallery supporting them seems unlikely at best
[10:17:55] <risky_s> hi, having problems with a <ul> list in ie7, it seems to stay dropped down? any hints?
[10:18:15] <Emn1ty> what do you mean "stay dropped down"?
[10:18:25] <xec> Emn1ty: what do you mean "isn't working"?
[10:18:37] <Emn1ty> xec: it says in my comments
[10:18:42] <risky_s> i have a ul list thats supposed to be inline
[10:18:44] <Emn1ty> it doesn't append the element
[10:19:02] <risky_s> but in IE7 it doesnt go inline with each other
[10:19:58] <Emn1ty> ie7 supports it... hm is there any other styles being applied to it?
[10:21:00] <xec> Emn1ty: .append() does not take a second options argument
[10:21:24] <Emn1ty> xec: is there another way to do it?
[10:21:50] <Emn1ty> ah, perhaps the comma is the issue
[10:22:19] <jarr0dsz> hey guys i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/bEn5k/
[10:22:23] <xec> Emn1ty: just create the span element beforehand and refer to it, or create the span in one string
[10:22:26] <jarr0dsz> and it cannot load the content from /getcredits on my webapp
[10:22:38] <jarr0dsz> but if i just call localhost:3000/getcredits it returns the html fine
[10:22:38] <xec> like you did with the other .append() calls further dowon
[10:22:40] <xec> down*
[10:22:49] <Emn1ty> ok
[10:22:52] <jarr0dsz> how could it be that my ajax cannot load the html, bad chars in it or some other strange thing?
[10:23:50] <xec> jarr0dsz: why do you have a comma after the last object value (500) ?
[10:24:10] <io__> hi anybody know of a hover preview for images that will adjust a bit depending on the browser borders position?
[10:24:26] <jarr0dsz> xec: typo removed, strange thing is it just refuses the load certain urls :s
[10:24:51] <xec> jarr0dsz: are they on another domain by any chance? :)
[10:25:26] <octal__> ^
[10:25:40] <jarr0dsz> xec: no they are on the same domain
[10:25:59] <jarr0dsz> i cal like /feedback in with ajax goes fine and i callin /getcredits with ajax and it won't load the content
[10:26:04] <xec> jarr0dsz: any errors in console? do you see the http request happening?
[10:26:06] <jarr0dsz> curl /getcredits works fine even
[10:26:34] <devmikey> xec: I've found pay ones that do
[10:26:57] <devmikey> And iWeb has one that works
[10:27:07] <xec> devmikey: awesomesauce!
[10:27:25] <devmikey> only problem is, iWeb's code is so bad, you cant embed it
[10:27:34] <xec> haha tell me about it
[10:27:36] <jarr0dsz> xec: yes thx but it reloads tot the /getcredits url so it goes to fast to see what happens
[10:29:27] <jarr0dsz> xec: it seems it first does a POST then a GET
[10:29:35] <jarr0dsz> to load that /getcredits html in
[10:31:19] <z0ned> anyone know how to jump to a specific line # in chrome development tools (script debug mode) ?
[10:32:37] <jarr0dsz> xec: arhghhhh i found the issue
[10:32:42] <jarr0dsz> i have it linked to /getcredits instead of #
[10:32:45] <jarr0dsz> i suck at js ;p
[10:34:38] <jarr0dsz> you jquery gurus know maybe a simple way to pass a url variable to a function now i have this http://jsfiddle.net/bEn5k/2/
[10:34:59] <jarr0dsz> but then i have to make a new section for every single link, could i pass the link in the <a href maybe ?
[10:36:20] <johnkpaul> jarr0dsz: url variable to a function? do you mean from the querystring?
[10:36:52] <jarr0dsz> johnkpaul: that i can have the link that it should open inside the <a href =""></a> somehow
[10:37:13] <jarr0dsz> so i can remove the         href:'/getcredits', part and have just 1 global "loader"
[10:37:19] <jarr0dsz> load = the piece of code to launch the modal box
[10:38:23] <johnkpaul> jarr0dsz: http://jsfiddle.net/bEn5k/3/
[10:39:26] <jarr0dsz> johnkpaul: okay i try to understand that would load the # as the url right?
[10:39:49] <jarr0dsz> so if i change that to something else like "/getcredits" it would load that url instead
[10:40:00] <johnkpaul> it will load whaever the href is
[10:40:04] <johnkpaul> on the item that the click handler is attached
[10:40:09] <jarr0dsz> the problem with that is my rails webapp should not load the url so i can only set it to #
[10:40:34] <jarr0dsz> perhaps i can add another thingy to the a href like  rel="/getcredits" and then just rel or another html item for the url storage?
[10:40:34] <johnkpaul> then where do you want to get the url from?
[10:41:49] <DerekPioneer> using <input type="file">, how would i reference that in a jquery ajax call?     like data: "filename=" + jQuery('#filename').val() " ?
[10:41:51] <johnkpaul> data-real-href?
[10:42:23] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: you mean for the filename?
[10:42:30] <DerekPioneer> no i mean
[10:42:32] <johnkpaul> as part of the browser sandbox, your JS doesn't have acess to the filename
[10:42:33] <DerekPioneer> the actual file data
[10:42:33] <Raverix> DerekPioneer: You don't.
[10:42:40] <Raverix> It's protected by the browser.
[10:42:42] <Sugitime> I have a PHP form, and I want to utilize a 2 connected lists. One is available tests and one is assigned tests. I want to be able to drag an available test to the assigned column, and then be able to order them and save it. How can I get these values when I submit the form?
[10:42:48] <Raverix> The actual file data is even more protected.
[10:42:49] <DerekPioneer> so i would have to wrap it in <form> tags ?
[10:42:57] <DerekPioneer> and then call it
[10:43:03] <DerekPioneer> i can't use ajax calls to send files?
[10:43:14] <Raverix> No, you cannot.
[10:43:19] <Raverix> You can fake it by submitting to an iFrame.
[10:43:19] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: depends on what you mean by ajax
[10:43:20] <johnkpaul> no xhr
[10:43:22] <johnkpaul> but you can use an iframe
[10:43:24] <Raverix> You should google ajax iframe file upload
[10:43:59] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: I've used this one successfuly
[10:44:00] <johnkpaul> http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[10:44:28] <Sugitime> I am using http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[10:44:31] <Raverix> Once uploaded, via something like johnkpaul linked, you can then use the server to pass that information back to your web app.
[10:45:22] <Raverix> jqueryui.com down for anyone else?
[10:45:38] <johnkpaul> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jqueryui.com
[10:45:41] <johnkpaul> nope, just you
[10:46:18] <Raverix> that unfortunately, means nothing to me.
[10:46:27] <Raverix> Because the site is 'up', but I'm seeing one of those default domain parking pages.
[10:46:45] <johnkpaul> sorry, I actually checeked too
[10:46:49] <johnkpaul> it is correct for me
[10:46:55] <Raverix> Weird.
[10:46:59] <Engin> .deserialize ?
[10:47:06] <johnkpaul> Raverix: dig jqueryui.com
[10:47:07] <tfittsy> jqueryui.com works, www.jqueryui.com doesn't
[10:47:18] <LakWork> Anyone about that can answer a jquerymobile question? #jquerymobile is a sad place devoice of life
[10:47:18] <johnkpaul> my A record is 205.186.146.156
[10:47:33] <johnkpaul> tfittsy: that redirects for me
[10:47:46] <LakWork> I'm trying to find an event i can subscribe to every time a new data-role="page" is presented. Dialog, link click, whatever the transition
[10:47:55] <tfittsy> johnkpaul: funny, I'm seeing the same domain parking as Raverix
[10:48:57] <Raverix> http://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/jqueryui.com
[10:49:00] <cdibened> @LakWork:  Can't you subscribe to the 'pageshow' event?
[10:49:08] <hlve`workaholic> anybody have any alternatives to jsfiddle?
[10:49:36] <FrameFever> I have following, I init my script in $(document).ready but still some pictures are not loaded

[10:51:00] <zCoder>  Hi, I'm looking for a freelancer for my project. I need an experienced developer in the following languages javascript - jquery - php - css - html - mysql and someone who is able to put in 4+ hours a day of work. Please PM me, thanks.
[10:51:45] <sYFFAN> Hi, I'm trying to assign a single jqueryui menu to multiple buttons. After selecting an item, the position of the menu is incorrect. How to fix? http://jsbin.com/eziged/edit#javascript,html
[10:54:02] <magcius> Do jQuery Deferreds have something like Twisted's callback chaining?
[10:56:08] <johnkpaul> magcius: yes
[10:56:18] <johnkpaul> .pipe
[10:56:22] <johnkpaul> (I think)
[10:59:10] <MooingLemur> not sure if this has already been brought up, but it looks like jqueryui.com is in the process of registrar expiration.  I still have the IPs cached in DNS, but a colleague sees a namecheap parking page.
[11:00:35] <magcius> johnkpaul,  http://fpaste.org/vnBB is what I'm doing right now
[11:01:44] <johnkpaul> yeah, req.pipe is what you want
[11:02:03] <Raverix> MooingLemur: Yeah, about 5 minutes too late ;)
[11:02:04] <johnkpaul> return req.pipe(function(data){ return buildFilView(data);});
[11:02:04] <magcius> Ah, OK
[11:02:51] <MooingLemur> :)
[11:03:08] <Sugitime> I am using jquery UI sortable. Everything is almost working, however I have 1 small issue. Here is the code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/4242408   The issue is that the change function runs when ever Sortable1 is changes, but I need it to run when Sortable2 is changes. Any idea how I can do this?
[11:04:13] <chrisvwebdev> hello all.  is it possible to force css styles on a select element for ie7?
[11:05:17] <Sugitime> Figured it out. I used the receive event instead of the change event
[11:15:14] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: valum's file uploader is giving me "origin blahblah is allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[11:15:49] <johnkpaul> are you posting to a different domain?
[11:21:16] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question: is it better to merge all my asset files and minify (at build-time), even if every page needs it's own unique asset file because of this, or should I suffer multiple requests in exchange for caching common / global assets?
[11:21:54] <kaneda^> hey all, i'm having trouble wrapping my head around session testing when using uploadify
[11:22:02] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: that's a big it depends
[11:22:21] <johnkpaul> how big would all of your js be minified and concatenated?
[11:22:21] <kaneda^> my backend is java, and i've seen how to upload without session testing, but what if i want to track the user who uploaded something?
[11:23:25] <FrameFever> can anybody help me with my images?
[11:24:04] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: yes, i am posting to a different domain
[11:24:28] <johnkpaul> so that plugin has the same restrictions that normal xhr ajax does
[11:24:39] <johnkpaul> the same origin policy won't let you access data from a different domain
[11:24:39] <ProLoser|Work> johnkpaul: is bigger better or smaller better?
[11:24:42] <ProLoser|Work> i'm honestly not sure
[11:24:44] <Raverix> ProLoser|Work: As johnkpaul pointed out, it really depends...
[11:24:52] <Raverix> The number of requests, your current bottle necks, etc.
[11:24:56] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: not better or worse, I just mean that your decision depends on how big it is
[11:24:59] <johnkpaul> and many other things
[11:25:11] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: there are other ajax plugins that might allow me to post to different domains though?
[11:25:11] <Raverix> Consolidating is typically a good thing.
[11:25:14] <Raverix> but there are limits.
[11:25:29] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: not without using CORS which needs a lot of server side stuff
[11:26:01] <Raverix> DerekPioneer: do you need to actually 'post'?
[11:26:12] <DerekPioneer> Raverix: yes
[11:26:20] <DerekPioneer> have to send them the file somehow
[11:26:31] <Raverix> DerekPioneer: Perhaps you should be working with server side languages?
[11:26:51] <Raverix> Can you give us, briefly, and overview of what your end goal is?
[11:26:56] <Raverix> There might be an established solution.
[11:27:04] <DerekPioneer> i am interacting with an adobe image server
[11:27:43] <DerekPioneer> i have to retrieve an upload token from adobe's image server, and then post a form
[11:28:02] <DerekPioneer> with an action url that points towards something like this: adobe.com/image?op=upload&company_name=company&upload_token=234214
[11:28:07] <DerekPioneer> with a $_POST value of filename
[11:28:17] <Raverix> Yeah...
[11:28:35] <Raverix> this should be done via a server side integration, powered by AJAX if you want to make a slicker interface.
[11:29:01] <DerekPioneer> what do you mean "via server side integration"?
[11:29:13] <Raverix> PHP / .NET (C#/VB)
[11:29:27] <Raverix> IE: Server side programming languages.
[11:29:38] <Raverix> As opposed to Javascript, which is a client side scripting language.
[11:29:51] <DerekPioneer> yes i know what a server side language is
[11:29:57] <DerekPioneer> i guess i'm asking where i should start
[11:30:01] <DerekPioneer> if you could point me in a direction
[11:30:02] <Eviltwin> NodeJS
[11:30:38] <Raverix> DerekPioneer: You should start by reading the doucmentation for Adobe's image server, I'm not familiar enough with it to give you specific information about it.
[11:31:22] <Raverix> But, with all the languages I listed above, you can GET/PUT/POST to urls with data, etc.
[11:31:43] <Raverix> This is how web API integrations are typically done.
[11:32:01] <DerekPioneer> you mean using something like curl?
[11:32:08] <Raverix> In PHP, yes.
[11:32:16] <DerekPioneer> oh i forgot i'm not in the #php channel
[11:32:17] <DerekPioneer> lol
[11:32:25] <DerekPioneer> hmm ok
[11:32:43] <DerekPioneer> so like, user uploads an image, how am i going to grab those file contents
[11:32:55] <DerekPioneer> and get them into a server side language
[11:33:05] <Raverix> ...
[11:33:05] <DerekPioneer> i'm not explaining what i'm asking very well
[11:33:19] <Raverix> It's not a matter of explaining, it's a matter of understanding.
[11:33:31] <Dan_Wilson_> DerekPioneer when the image is uploaded, the server will have the bits for that image. Thus, you would use your server side language to deal with it.
[11:33:33] <Raverix> File upload has been standard in HTML for years.
[11:33:55] <Raverix> Look up any information regarding "file upload PHP"
[11:34:53] <DerekPioneer> so you're saying
[11:34:57] <DerekPioneer> i'm going to have to upload the image to my local server
[11:35:02] <DerekPioneer> and THEN send it the adobe image server
[11:35:04] <DerekPioneer> sounds slow
[11:35:27] <MistuhKurtz> is there a way to reverse e.preventDefault(); ?
[11:36:02] <MistuhKurtz> i have an accordion and if a link is clicked i want a panel to open, but if the link is clicked a second time I want it to work as normal
[11:36:10] <theoN> Hi, I am looking for a native solution or plugin that enables me to cycle through an <ul> or <ol> in a specific manner: at any time there is a maximum of 3 <li>'s shown to the user (<li>'s are displayed inline), buttons for previous/next are already present which should let you do the cycling. The behaviour I am lookign for is this: when I press Next, the next (only 1 at a time) LI slides in from the right, while at the same time, the LI o
[11:36:11] <theoN> n the left (first one visible on the screen) slides out of the visible area (visible area is determined by setting width/heights for the UL) ... could anyone help me with this?
[11:36:22] <MistuhKurtz> should i just grab the HREF and change window.location ?
[11:36:28] <Raverix> DerekPioneer - do you need to get the result of whatever adobe sends back?
[11:36:40] <DerekPioneer> yeah
[11:36:48] <Raverix> Then you have to do it the way I said.
[11:37:14] <Raverix> If it was something where you don't care about the return, you could post it to adobe and have the results open in a new window / iframe...
[11:37:19] <Raverix> But then you have not way to access that information.
[11:37:30] <Raverix> Slow or not, this is the way it works.
[11:38:15] <Raverix> Again, I'm not familiar with this particular service, perhaps they have a front end API available.
[11:38:15] <MistuhKurtz> theoN, http://caroufredsel.frebsite.nl/ is the most robust and expansive carousel i've come across
[11:38:30] <MistuhKurtz> it could be overkill but it covers a lot of different use-cases
[11:38:35] <MistuhKurtz> yours should be no problem
[11:39:07] <MistuhKurtz> i don't know about the <li>s being set to display:inline; though theoN
[11:39:17] <MistuhKurtz> usually with a carousel, the elements are either floated or set to block
[11:40:33] <theoN> MistuhKurtz, well I was actually wrong, they're set to display: inline-block, but floating blocks shouldn't be an issue either if it's needed. Thanks for the link, I'll check it out :)
[11:42:21] * anphonic sighs with great frustration
[11:43:03] <theoN> MistuhKurtz, wow thanks for that link, why did I not know about this before? It has so many features
[11:43:13] <DerekPioneer> ok but Raverix, if i use a default html form i don't need any ssi to upload to the remote image servers
[11:43:21] <DerekPioneer> the default html form that adobe gives me in documentation
[11:43:22] <theoN> very complete plugin indeed
[11:43:30] <DerekPioneer> it's something to do with the way this valum's plugin specifically is sending files
[11:43:46] <MistuhKurtz> yeah theoN it was a hidden gem i found, idk why it doesn't have as much visibility as something like say the jquery cycle plugin
[11:43:47] <anphonic> MistuhKurtz: does it support multiple image sizes though?
[11:44:14] <MistuhKurtz> i don't know anphonic
[11:44:38] <theoN> MistuhKurtz, exactly, I've worked with the cycle plugin before, but its functionality out of the box is much more limited than this one
[11:44:58] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, there's an example for 'variable item sizes' anphonic
[11:45:34] <MistuhKurtz> they have different purposes theoN, i just used it as an example of a well-known plugin
[11:45:42] <anphonic> Jcycle is giving me issues that i dont have time to try to resolve, so i'm on the hunt for a fast/easy slider/carousel
[11:45:57] <MistuhKurtz> anphonic, try this one i just linked.
[11:46:12] <MistuhKurtz> i liked it better than jcycle when i needed a carousel
[11:46:28] <MistuhKurtz> like i said it's very robust and covers lots of different possible uses
[11:47:03] <anphonic> I'm having to create a slider from a dynamically created page. Getting things to play nicely with all the other js/mootools is not easy
[11:47:57] <anphonic> nivoslider sorta worked, but doesnt work with different sized images
[11:47:57] <theoN> well I don't like combining js libraries in general, had a lot of bad experiences with that in the past
[11:48:01] <adispezio> Q
[11:48:01] <theoN> maybe it's better nowadays
[11:49:40] <FrameFever> How can I load a image by myself?
[11:50:03] <kaneda^> hey guys, i'm using uploadify right now and it uses flash, but when i make a request from it to my upload servlet the servlet says the session is null, any ideas?
[11:51:33] <zCoder> Hi, I'm looking for a freelancer for my project. I need an experienced developer in the following languages javascript - jquery - php - css - html - mysql and someone who is able to put in 4+ hours a day of work. Please PM me.
[11:51:34] <someprimetime> what is the string that gets sent back upon a successful ajax call or now?
[11:51:38] <someprimetime> xhr.status?
[11:51:43] <someprimetime> xhr.status == 'success'?
[11:51:53] <cisox> I'm working on replacing the YUI Library with JQuery. The YUI Dom API has a function called getAncestorsByClassName(object, parentClass). What would be the best way to replicate that with JQuery?
[11:53:04] <warrenparsons> cisox: $(elem).parents().filter('.ancestorClass') might work
[11:53:21] <cisox> warrenparsons: Thanks, I'll give it a try.
[11:53:31] <ajpiano> .parents(".someClass")
[11:53:44] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: Doh! Yeah, that too.
[11:53:57] <cisox> ajpiano, warrenparsons: Thanks guys.
[11:54:47] <bartmax> question
[11:54:48] <luke--> if I want to position an element with .css("top", ..) that is hidden, is there a better way to do this than displaying it, positioning it and hiding it again?
[11:55:51] <bartmax> having var dates = $('selector').datepicker({minDate: someFunctionHere(), maxDate: someFunctionHere()});
[11:56:14] <bartmax> how can I initialize the someFunctionHere in the scope of datepicker without making accessible to the rest of the code ?
[11:56:30] <warrenparsons> luke--: An element with display: none; applied should still be able to accept a "top" value.
[11:56:38] <luke--> hmmmm
[11:56:47] <bartmax> the function is something like : new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 01) for minDate and new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 11, 31) for max date. (don't want to call getFullYear twice.
[11:56:55] <warrenparsons> luke--: Or you could put your CSS in your CSS and just apply a class to that element, depending on your situation.
[11:57:18] <Joeytje50> hey, is it possible to match all divs, except for ones that are inside a <table>
[11:57:54] <warrenparsons> Joeytje50: $('div').not('table div');
[11:58:03] <Joeytje50> ah thanks
[11:58:04] <bartmax> Joeytje50: $('div').not('table div'); should work
[11:58:06] <bartmax> damn
[11:58:07] <warrenparsons> Ha!
[11:58:09] <Joeytje50> lol
[11:58:12] <Joeytje50> ninja'd :P
[11:58:15] <bartmax> hahaha
[11:58:18] <theoN> I was about to type that too
[11:58:19] <theoN> :(
[11:58:31] <bartmax> warrenparsons: would you mind ask my q ?
[11:58:31] <bartmax> :D
[11:58:41] <warrenparsons> My thought process: "Ooh! Ooh! I know this one! Gotta be first!"
[11:58:57] <warrenparsons> bartmax: Sure
[11:59:09] <anphonic> why would this page be telling me "#<Object> has no method"  when the script is there?  http://goo.gl/qoUHc
[11:59:36] <bartmax> anphonic: you are doing #somename instead of '#somename'
[12:00:32] <anphonic> this is the call to it $('#ap_pht_wrapper').carouFredSel
[12:00:35] <theoN> MistuhKurtz, any idea how well this works in earlier <IE9? (need compatibility up to IE7)
[12:00:55] <MistuhKurtz> i tested it for ie8
[12:01:12] <anphonic> I THINK its another module thats causing other issues
[12:01:20] <bartmax> shoudl be $('#ap_pht_wrapper').carouFredSel() ?
[12:01:21] <MistuhKurtz> usually what you have to look out for is the CSS
[12:01:25] <bartmax> shouldnt
[12:01:31] <anphonic> if only corePHP would fix what they sell, instead of saying "well its your problem now"
[12:01:53] <anphonic> bartmax: Yes, i have the full call there, i jsut shortened it for here.
[12:01:57] <theoN> fingers crossed it works in IE7 then
[12:02:14] <anphonic> $('#ap_pht_wrapper').carouFredSel({ ... });
[12:03:52] <bartmax> warrenparsons: made a fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/bfHNm/
[12:04:01] <bartmax> that works perfectly
[12:04:05] <bartmax> i just want to clean up the code a little
[12:04:16] <bartmax> and don't call new Date().getFullYear() 3 times
[12:04:18] <warrenparsons> bartmax: Are you sure you meant that for me?
[12:04:57] <bartmax> and also don't expose the var outside the scope of the datepicker
[12:05:05] <bartmax> warrenparsons: i guess you would answer my question :)
[12:06:52] <warrenparsons> bartmax: Sorry, what was the question?
[12:07:07] <kaneda^> ok, where did my cookies go now that i have it registering the hash?
[12:10:28] <bartmax> warrenparsons: i dont want to call new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 01), 3 times
[12:10:45] <bartmax> i want to store in a var / function / whatever but not outside the scope of the function (wrapper is an option)
[12:12:28] <bartmax> also create event isn't working for some reason
[12:12:36] <warrenparsons> bartmax: You could write a subroutine to accept your two args, but if this is the only place you're using it, it's probably not worth it.
[12:13:13] <bartmax> warrenparsons: i was thinking in using the create event to assign options after creation but for some reason it's not triggered :S
[12:14:04] <cers> hi, I have 3 lists, and I want to be able to move elements from #1 to #2, and from #2 to #3, each time, they should be added to the bottom of the list they are added to - what would be the best way to do this?
[12:14:07] <bartmax> warrenparsons: bah, create doesn't work... for future development :(
[12:14:40] <bartmax> cers : DOM or JSON ?
[12:15:12] <cers> bartmax: DOM, the list is an ul, elements li
[12:15:20] <bartmax> cers: in case of object, take a look at pop , shift
[12:15:33] <bartmax> cers: for DOM append to put into last
[12:16:07] <bartmax> cers: ok, example: $('someelement').append('#list2')
[12:16:12] <bartmax> sorry
[12:16:14] <bartmax> appendTo
[12:16:24] <bartmax> $('someElement').appendTo('#list2');
[12:16:37] <bartmax> that will move it from where it is to the bottom of list2
[12:17:01] <stephen> I'm using .live to hook click on a custom tooltip. What is the appropriate way to emulate .blur on a dom element?
[12:17:13] <cers> bartmax: I see I have been way too unclear. I mean as in move with the mouse - like .sortable() with connectWith, but where the user can't actually sort - only "connect", so to say
[12:17:17] <stephen> Basically I want the tooltip to hide if I click anywhere but the image
[12:17:38] * anphonic rawrs
[12:17:51] <stephen> .blur doesn't seem to work (I assume it's only for form elements
[12:18:20] <bartmax> stephen: how do you get focus if it's not a form element ?
[12:18:37] <b-lew> is there a jQuery pluggin for this? http://inventiveandco.co.uk/#/about
[12:18:39] <stephen> bartmax: I'm showing the tooltip on click
[12:18:50] <bartmax> stephen: mouseLeave
[12:18:52] <b-lew> if you scroll up and down the columns going in opposite directions
[12:19:00] <stephen> Bartmax: Even for a click?
[12:19:08] <bartmax> stephen: no, mouseLeave on the 'button'
[12:19:25] <stephen> bartmax: I don't want it to disappear when the mouseleave? I want it to disappear on click anywhere but the button
[12:19:38] <bartmax> stephen: ok, then do this :
[12:19:47] <bartmax> hook a click on document
[12:19:54] <bartmax> and do a e.stopPropagation on the click event
[12:20:22] <b-lew> I thought that was pretty cool and wanted to see if it was a jQuery custom code or a plugin
[12:20:29] <stephen> I take it only if my tooltip is showing
[12:20:44] <stephen> Hmm.. ok. that should work, and allow other elements to continue to work
[12:21:21] <bartmax> stephen: you can hook unhook when needed if necesarry but i don't recommend the overhaul
[12:21:50] <stephen> won't hooking document that way stop all other clicks?
[12:22:08] <bartmax> cers: no idea. Sorry, never worked with dragDrop events
[12:22:24] <bartmax> stephen: nope. document is the last check
[12:22:46] <bartmax> stephen: if you have let's say a standard anchor, it will execute the anchor action then the document.
[12:23:28] <bartmax> stephen: you can avoid the document action (in the tooltip image) doing a stopPropagation call to the event like : $('#imagetooltip').click(function(e)) { e.stopPropagation();}
[12:24:21] <stephen> bartmax: Thanks, I'll give it a shot
[12:24:39] <bartmax> stephen: if you, let's say, do a $(document).click(function(e){e.preventDefault()}); I guess yes, you unset every non-js click on a page.
[12:25:40] <stephen> so, basically: $(document).click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation; $(tooltip).hide(); })
[12:25:49] <kaneda^> if anyone is interested i figured out how to do secure session tracking from uploadify to a servlet
[12:25:50] <stephen> That make sense?
[12:25:58] <cers> bartmax: np, thanks for the attempt :-)
[12:26:01] <Chopps> hey guys, does anyone know the link for a tut or guide called fixthisjquery or something like that, ive seen ppl getting the links using a command but i dont remember the cmd or the url, thanks in advance
[12:26:43] <b-lew> http://inventiveandco.co.uk/#/about -> anyone seen this jQuery scroll before? goes in 2 different directions.
[12:26:51] <warrenparsons> Chopps: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:27:28] <Chopps> awesome, thanks warrenparsons :D
[12:28:12] <bartmax> stephen: no
[12:28:47] <bartmax> stephen:  $(document).click(function(e) { $(tooltip).hide(); }) $(tooltip).click(function(e){e.stopPropagation()});
[12:28:51] <stephen> Oh, wait, I see
[12:28:51] <stephen> stopPropagation in the button click
[12:28:55] <rfetch> hello
[12:28:57] <rfetch> can you helpme
[12:28:58] <bartmax> yup
[12:29:01] <rfetch> :=)
[12:29:03] <bartmax> rfetch: i cant but i wont
[12:29:05] <bartmax> :)
[12:29:07] <rfetch> :)
[12:29:08] <rfetch> http://pastebin.com/4sHzERqk
[12:30:12] <stephen> Hmm
[12:30:27] <stephen> Wierd.. It appears .live() jacks with this.
[12:30:29] <stephen> Great
[12:30:45] <bartmax> rfetch: try changin function Test(target) { ....  and href:havascript:Test(this);
[12:30:52] <stephen> .stopPropagation() in a live event doesn't stop $(document).click from firing
[12:31:05] <bartmax> stephen: yes it does :)
[12:31:13] <rfetch> i no want it :/
[12:31:19] <rfetch> do you know other methods ?
[12:31:26] <rfetch> hmm
[12:31:29] <rfetch> yes
[12:31:30] <rfetch> :-)
[12:31:30] <bartmax> rfetch: sure, unobstrusive js
[12:31:39] <rfetch> with .click
[12:31:50] <bartmax> $('a').click(Test);
[12:32:06] <stephen> bartmax: Then I have another problem? I'll hunt it. Basically, immediately after hitting event.stopPropagation(), $(document).click() is firing
[12:32:29] <bartmax> are you using event in the function parameter ?
[12:32:38] <stephen> ?
[12:32:46] <bartmax> $(tooltip).click(function(event) {event.stopPropagation});
[12:32:47] <stephen> yes, I am
[12:32:59] <bartmax> $(tooltip).click(function(event) {event.stopPropagation();});
[12:33:46] <stephen> yeah
[12:33:49] <stephen> It's more like this
[12:34:21] <karega|aniasis> hey I want to halt js execution until all the images I have preloaded have been loaded. how can I do that?
[12:34:54] <Elena-rus> hi all
[12:35:12] <Elena-rus> I'm using inline code <a href="#" onclick="updateMedia(), playAudio()">
[12:35:18] <bartmax> stephen: just tested it, live works ok with stopProp...
[12:35:20] <stephen> $(button).live("click",function(event) { $(document.click(function(e) { tooltip.Hide(); } ); $(tooltip).show(); event.stopPropagation(); })
[12:35:31] <bartmax> lol
[12:35:42] <Elena-rus> I'd like to do it externally via tap function
[12:35:54] <bartmax> why $(document) is inside the $(button) click ????
[12:36:01] <Elena-rus> via live('tap', function (){})
[12:36:15] <stephen> bartmax: Yeah, I just caught that
[12:36:43] <rfetch> bartmax
[12:36:46] <rfetch> sorry
[12:36:53] <rfetch> but i have more one questions
[12:36:53] <rfetch> http://pastebin.com/CfWZYP0Q
[12:37:14] <Elena-rus> how could I possibly do so? would anybody please advise?
[12:39:38] <b-lew> http://inventiveandco.co.uk/#/about -> anyone seen this jQuery scroll before? goes in 2 different directions.
[12:39:59] <Elena-rus> should I possibly use a selector such as $('a').live('tap', function()) or wouldn't it work?
[12:40:04] <Elena-rus> it doesn't seem to work for me
[12:40:16] <lkeijser> hi I'm developing a Django site which uses a js file (located here: https://raw.github.com/liberation/django-mptt-comments/master/mptt_comments/medias/js/mptt_comments.js) . There's a problem however, when the user submits the form, it actually triggers POST twice. Can someone experienced take a look to see what could be wrong?
[12:40:30] <xec> ?text @ rfetch
[12:40:30] <bot-t1> rfetch, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/

[12:41:24] <lkeijser> the same file on dpaste: http://dpaste.com/699180/ , the submit part is on line 70
[12:42:35] <Eviltwin> rfetch: http://jsfiddle.net/356gu/
[12:42:55] <kanzie> is there any way to make something similar to pointers in javascript. I have four different arrays that I continuously updated with new values and the user can select which array to subscribe to by clicking a link. I want to have this link change the value of a "router" that I use to determine which of the four arrays I should return
[12:43:35] <Eviltwin> kanzie: JavaScript doesn't have "pointers" but it has "references" which are basically the same idea
[12:43:39] <kanzie> if I do myRoute = array3, I just get a current snapshot of this array in this second…whereas I need it to always give me the current state of array3.
[12:43:52] <kanzie> Eviltwin: excellent… so any idea how I could solve this?
[12:43:53] <Eviltwin> No, you don't get a snapshot
[12:43:56] <Eviltwin> You get a reference to the array
[12:44:06] <Eviltwin> Arrays and objects are always passed by reference
[12:44:58] <kanzie> ah, sweet Ill try that
[12:45:19] <Eviltwin> kanzie: http://jsfiddle.net/ZD9pr/
[12:45:36] <Eviltwin> I pass myArr to bar and bar doesn't return anything
[12:45:36] <cers> hi, I have 3 lists (ul), and I want to be able to move elements from #1 to #2, and from #2 to #3, each time, they should be added to the bottom of the list (preferably with placeholder) they are added to - what would be the best way to do this? I'm assuming sortable with connectWith is a good start?
[12:45:43] <Eviltwin> Yet the value is still updated
[12:46:27] <Eviltwin> cers: If by "I want to be able to move" you mean you want the user to be able to drag items around, then yes, look at sortable/draggable/connectWith
[12:47:08] <someprimetime> how come this is only returning 1?
[12:47:09] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/qn54b/
[12:47:16] <someprimetime> there are obviously two list elements within that <ul>
[12:47:40] <Eviltwin> Uh.....what do you think .size('li') does?
[12:47:44] <cers> Eviltwin: right now I have sortable, but the user shouldn't be able to sort the individual lists, and only place items at the bottom of the target list - and I can't seem to make that work
[12:47:46] <someprimetime> that's old h/o
[12:47:55] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/qn54b/1/
[12:47:56] <someprimetime> still 1
[12:48:11] <Eviltwin> Uh.....what do you think .last() does?
[12:48:44] <someprimetime> well it's telling me that there is 1 <ul> element
[12:48:50] <someprimetime> how can i get the number of <li>'s within it?
[12:49:02] <someprimetime> children('ul li').last().length?
[12:49:04] <eddiemonge> ?last
[12:49:04] <bot-t1> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[12:49:18] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: see ?last see ?size see ?children
[12:49:19] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[12:49:19] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .size(): Return the number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[12:49:19] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[12:49:22] <Eviltwin> Read those
[12:49:28] <sysadmin4hire> is anyone willing to help me decypher what the heck is happening here: http://pastebin.com/yVyJnccR
[12:49:30] <someprimetime> ok
[12:50:01] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/qn54b/1/
[12:50:06] <eddiemonge> and dont use .size()
[12:50:09] <eddiemonge> like, ever
[12:50:25] <someprimetime> yeah i know, use length instead
[12:50:31] <someprimetime> did you update?
[12:50:56] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/qn54b/3/
[12:51:00] <Eviltwin> sysadmin4hire: Well, have you done JavaScript before? jQuery?
[12:51:34] <sysadmin4hire> yes, - currently reading jQuery in Action.
[12:52:39] <Eviltwin> I would suggest learning jQuery before trying to decypher this but if you insist, we can try to help you understand
[12:52:56] <sysadmin4hire> well i think i understand the concepts.
[12:52:59] <eddiemonge> i effin hate pastebin
[12:53:18] <sysadmin4hire> its just trying to pinpoint what each line does - i'm breaking it apart to learn.
[12:53:19] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: I still prefer it to jsbin, for some reason that only loads like 20% of the time for me
[12:53:25] <cybertop> hi
[12:53:32] <sysadmin4hire> would you be willing to help me understand just a few lines?
[12:53:36] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: do you mean jsfiddle? jsbin loads always for me
[12:53:38] <Eviltwin> sysadmin4hire: Sure, which ones?
[12:53:42] <someprimetime> jsfiddle is slow as hell
[12:53:52] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: jsFiddle is slow sometimes but I just get blank pages for jsbin more often than not
[12:53:58] <eddiemonge> sysadmin4hire: sure. get rid of all the <font> and itll be far more understandable
[12:54:01] <rfetch> Eviltwin,xec,bot-t1 thanks!
[12:54:04] <Eviltwin> And I don't understand why
[12:54:06] <someprimetime> why doesn't jsfiddle start charging?
[12:54:08] <someprimetime> i'd pay for that
[12:54:13] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: you should take to remy about that
[12:54:14] <someprimetime> if they promised uptime
[12:54:22] <Eviltwin> I'm tempted to just host my own jsfiddle
[12:54:24] <cybertop> how can help me on jQuery-File-Upload?
[12:54:25] <Eviltwin> The source is public
[12:54:43] <eddiemonge> jsfiddle just needs better hosting thats all
[12:55:02] <Eviltwin> Which is why I want to host my own where I'm the only one who can author
[12:55:03] <sysadmin4hire> ok so lines 6+7 -- mostly the if ($(this).parent().data('created') !== true)
[12:55:20] <Eviltwin> sysadmin4hire: So do you understand what $(...) does?
[12:55:30] <sysadmin4hire> this - as I've read, can refer to a DOM element or a jQuery object.
[12:55:46] <Eviltwin> In this case it's an event listener so it corresponds to a DOM element
[12:55:52] <sysadmin4hire> its referring to a jQuery object (handleblur) yes?
[12:55:56] <sysadmin4hire> dangit.
[12:56:04] <Eviltwin> In order to perform jQuery methods on a DOM element, you need to put them into a jQuery object
[12:56:07] <anjen> but it's referenced from $('.box input'), so I'd assume that's "this"
[12:56:09] <sysadmin4hire> that's what I don't really understand.
[12:56:09] <Eviltwin> And you can do that by $(element)
[12:56:21] <cybertop> i able to run the file upload
[12:56:28] <Eviltwin> So $(this) is the jQuery object containing the input that was blurred in this case
[12:57:19] <sysadmin4hire> ok so - that's the "makeup" for my function called handleblur where I throw my elements at.
[12:57:38] <sysadmin4hire> well - i would select elements and then apply the function on them.
[12:57:39] <eddiemonge> sysadmin4hire: i think you need to learn some basic js first, specifically scope and `this`
[12:57:58] <cybertop> but my problem is very strange, i use a input type="file" when click to select a file it work correctly but the filed is empty
[12:58:01] <webPragmatist> is it possible to submit multiple forms with jquery (using $.ajax)?
[12:58:13] <webPragmatist> (do they have to be done in sequence?)
[12:58:30] <eddiemonge> theres a #jsfiddle? nice
[12:58:35] <Eviltwin> sysadmin4hire: Have you worked with event listeners before?
[12:58:52] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: Uh....it doesn't really make sense to submit multiple with one $.ajax call
[12:59:00] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: What are you trying to accomplish?
[12:59:07] <cybertop> i want to fill the input value with the file path
[12:59:17] <cybertop> is it possible?
[12:59:37] <Eviltwin> cybertop: Not in every browser because it can be considered a security risk to reveal the file path to JavaScript
[13:00:05] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: a quick way to submit a bunch of "addtocart" ajax calls for a grouping of products
[13:00:30] <cybertop> evident ok, but the file is sent to server
[13:00:31] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: Make your server accept data with more than one item to add
[13:00:34] <webPragmatist> :(
[13:00:57] <sysadmin4hire> Eviltwin: nope on the event listeners
[13:01:06] <Eviltwin> sysadmin4hire: Then I'm going to ask you to see ?learn
[13:01:07] <bot-t1> sysadmin4hire, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:01:18] <Eviltwin> We're just going to confuse you more if we keep going
[13:01:29] <nFFF> Can't you send a form that contains all products to the cart?
[13:01:53] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: When you find yourself making several AJAX requests to accomplish a single "task", you're doing it wrong
[13:01:59] <cybertop> I do not understand why the text field of the input file remains empty even if sent
[13:02:00] <Eviltwin> That action should be atomic
[13:02:04] <sysadmin4hire> fair enough. thanks
[13:02:06] <Eviltwin> All the items should be added or none of them
[13:02:33] <eddiemonge> cybertop: are you doing any of this in js?
[13:03:20] <cybertop> eddiemonge noi use js only to send a file with ajax
[13:04:03] <cybertop> eddiemonge i use jQuery-File-Upload js
[13:04:03] <eddiemonge> cybertop: um, no you dont. not in every browser anyway. whats your question again?
[13:04:39] <cybertop> ok sorry for my English
[13:06:34] <cybertop> i have a form with <input type="file"> ,this is associated on js function to send a selected file with ajxa, this part run correctly
[13:07:30] <cybertop> the problem after sending the file, the field remains empty
[13:08:18] <Eviltwin> Well that's a damn shame, now isn't it?
[13:08:43] <Chopps> hey guys, if i have some code within $(document).ready(function() { /*code*/ }); is there any way to execute that code again without reloading the page?
[13:08:43] <eddiemonge> so after the file is uploaded, the input field is now blank?
[13:08:49] <nFFF> cybertop, field remains empty?
[13:09:00] <eddiemonge> Chopps: use a named function and pass that in to the ready block
[13:09:20] <nFFF> You mean the file isn't getting post'ed to the ajax call?
[13:09:41] <nFFF> OR after the ajax call the field goes blank? (whys this bad?)
[13:10:23] <cybertop> yes, in <input type=file> i don't see any value (the path of selected file)
[13:10:44] <nFFF> Are you serialzing the form?
[13:10:55] <cybertop> no
[13:10:56] <Eviltwin> ...
[13:11:27] <snover> what kind of questions is that?
[13:11:30] <snover> question*
[13:11:39] <eddiemonge> cybertop: fo the field is there. the user selects a file. the file uploads. the field is then empty. is that correct?
[13:11:43] <snover> 1. you cannot send files using xhr1
[13:11:50] <cybertop> yes
[13:11:58] <snover> 2. you cannot set the value of an <input type="file"> field programmatically for security reasons
[13:12:02] <eddiemonge> cybertop: yes to which question?
[13:12:19] <cybertop> cybertop: fo the field is there. the user selects a file. the file uploads. the field is then empty. is that correct?
[13:12:43] <snover> well that was fun.
[13:13:24] <eddiemonge> cybertop: ok then whats the problem. seems to work correctly
[13:14:48] <cybertop> eddiemonge I have to resubmit the entire form, including the file
[13:14:57] <rfetch> hello
[13:15:06] <rfetch> how i can find element by <a href?
[13:15:18] <pawel__> hi. is it possible to lazy load jquery based on a condition?
[13:15:24] <cybertop> here you can see a few lines of code http://pastebin.com/4hAjBa3e
[13:15:40] <eddiemonge> cybertop: why do you want to re-upload the file?
[13:15:45] <mikeymicrophone> has anyone used the wysihat function fontSizeSelection() ?
[13:16:20] <cybertop> eddiemonge initially only send the file to preview
[13:18:02] <eddiemonge> cybertop: if its already on the server, dont reupload it
[13:18:08] <Jon47> I've always wondered why jquery and other javascript engines need to use sizzle and other css selector engines - obviously browsers already have this functionality because they need to be able to parse css to apply the styles to the DOM, why not just expose the browser's native css selector engine as a DOM API?
[13:18:35] <eddiemonge> Jon47: its not that simple
[13:18:40] <eddiemonge> not even close
[13:19:09] <cybertop> eddiemonge i can try it
[13:19:09] <Jon47> i mean, i'm sure if browsers did this then sizzle wouldn't exist - so it must be necessary
[13:19:21] <eddiemonge> it is necessary
[13:19:26] <Jon47> but still, doesn't it seem like two ways to do the same thign?
[13:19:30] <eddiemonge> no
[13:19:53] <eddiemonge> i mean browsers already render text, why do we need html?
[13:20:13] <Jon47> I don't follow..
[13:20:20] <Jon47> html is more than text
[13:23:32] <eddiemonge> exactly
[13:23:51] <eddiemonge> if every browser functioned the same .... then there would only be one browser
[13:24:12] <eddiemonge> they all interact with the various things, css, html, js, plugins, differently
[13:24:26] <eddiemonge> so there is nothing to expose to be able to do selectors
[13:24:42] <eddiemonge> some support QuerySelectorAll and thats about the closest you can get
[13:24:46] <anjen> partly legacy, partly convenience
[13:24:55] <eddiemonge> but you still need sizzle and other selector engines as a fallback
[13:25:01] <Zzaichik> browsers….  psh
[13:25:20] <eddiemonge> that was all a far over simplization but there you go
[13:25:24] * anjen prefers my two tin cans with string
[13:26:19] <eddiemonge> on that note, i hate how expensive verizons data plans are. if they were cheaper or more reasonable, i would switch from sprint. sorry off topic rant
[13:26:31] <Zzaichik> I don't mind Sprint
[13:26:33] <Jon47> ooo yeah querySelectorAll, forgot about that
[13:26:52] <DerekPioneer> is there something similar to "window.opener." that i can use inside of an iframe
[13:26:59] <Zzaichik> FYI, Sprint and Verizon are practically the same network. They roam off of each others towers.  Both CDMA
[13:27:01] <DerekPioneer> to call javascript functions on the page that contains the iframe
[13:27:04] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: me neither, except for recently. the network is so slow now. and all these tiny plan changes and raises are starting to get annoying
[13:27:20] <Jon47> i guess i'm just surprised that querySelectorAll isn't always the fastest way to get the elements you're interested in - you'd think that off-loading all the work to the browser (written in C or whatever) would be faster than anything you can do in js
[13:27:21] <Zzaichik> …maybe I better look at my bill
[13:27:26] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: you mean like window.parent?
[13:27:27] <anjen> bandwidth issues and greed
[13:27:53] <eddiemonge> Jon47: is faster in a lot of cases, but not all
[13:28:08] <danzik17> eddiemonge: when did they raise prices?  just looked..10GB is 80$ now? wtf
[13:28:18] <Jon47> and we just abstract the logic that decides when to use it, when we use frameworks like jquery?
[13:28:29] <mordof> hmm
[13:28:34] <mordof> anyone know when the website will come back up?
[13:28:47] <eddiemonge> Jon47: short answer: always use jquery ;)
[13:28:54] <Jon47> haha, ok it makes sense now!  thank you eddiemonge
[13:28:55] <eddiemonge> mordof: what website?
[13:28:58] <mordof> jquery ui
[13:29:07] <eddiemonge> it is up
[13:29:27] <mordof> great...
[13:29:28] <edelgado> Question about .closest(): As it is traversing up the DOM, does it also go down parent elements, or "down into each branch"? I don't seem to have any luck with that.
[13:29:37] <Eviltwin> edelgado: Only ancestors
[13:29:43] <eddiemonge> mordof: and i dont see any alerts that it was down either
[13:29:48] <Eviltwin> It basically keeps running .parent() until it finds one that matches
[13:29:51] <mordof> if it's up then something is seriously wrong with my computer
[13:29:54] <Eviltwin> ?.closest @ edelgado
[13:29:55] <bot-t1> edelgado, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:29:58] <eddiemonge> edelgado: it looks at parents
[13:29:59] <mordof> i'm getting IIS errors and bad page info
[13:30:10] <eddiemonge> mordof: do a trace route
[13:30:24] <eddiemonge> mordof: that isnt jqui. i can guarentee that
[13:30:32] <Eviltwin> I believe it produces the same result as .parents().filter("selector").first()
[13:30:34] <eddiemonge> jqui is on a *nix server
[13:30:40] <Eviltwin> For each thing in the collection individually
[13:31:02] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: same results yes. functionally different though
[13:31:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:31:26] <mordof> hmm :\
[13:31:28] <anjen> could be some "noise" between you and them. check http://www.internetpulse.com/ if it concerns you
[13:31:50] <mordof> going from a core1-CoreA.ord1.rackspace.net to a 173-203-50-231.static.cloud-ips.com
[13:31:54] <mordof> as the final destinations
[13:31:56] <mordof> -.-;
[13:31:58] <Zzaichik> Verizon is $80 for 10gb?! wow - highway robbery.  Their phone selection isn't worth the extra. I'll stay with Sprint. Wait, does Sprint offer the new Galaxy?
[13:32:02] <edelgado> Eviltwin: Gotcha. Hmm, that's not going to work for me. I was hoping it would: go to the parent, see each child, go down each child, no luck? Go to your grandparent, and repeat.
[13:32:14] <Eviltwin> That's incredibly expensive
[13:32:36] <anjen> they charge by the gB? Odd I've had an unlimited plan since the release of the droid. Essentially no change to the cost.
[13:32:37] <anphonic> <-- unlimited verizon data :D
[13:32:40] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: not yet nope. verizon actually has a better phone selection currently
[13:32:42] <caseyd> does anyone know what calendar this is using? its nice: http://www.incheba.cz/en/calendar-of-events.html  is jquery?
[13:33:05] <edelgado> I know.. not real dollars tho :-]
[13:33:10] <danzik17> Zzaichik: don't get the galaxy imo, unless you don't care about the car/media docks ( or you're in europe... )
[13:33:35] <Zzaichik> haha - yeah, the only reason I'd want the new galaxy is for Ice Cream Sandwich
[13:33:36] <eddiemonge> edelgado: no that would be a horrible selector
[13:33:41] <anphonic> ^^
[13:33:42] <edelgado> Eviltwin: Thanks for your help tho! And eddiemonge.
[13:34:23] <Zzaichik> But I'm happy with EVO 4g, and the iPhone 5 (4g) should be coming out in a couple months I believe.
[13:34:32] <edelgado> eddiemonge: Horrible? Maybe. Useful? Maybe :-]
[13:34:40] <eddiemonge> caseyd: that page is using jquery but i think the calendar is rendered on the backend
[13:34:44] <mordof> i'm getting the same traceroute results on my ubuntu box
[13:34:48] <mordof> this doesn't make sense
[13:34:59] <edelgado> But I agree, I'm sure there is a better way to achieve what I need to do.
[13:35:16] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: iphone 5 wont hit until at least june, most likely october
[13:35:24] <caseyd> eddiemonge, just trying to tell if it is homemade, or if it is some kind of library or package
[13:35:29] <sgrover> jqueryui.com is down.  In case it hasn't been noted yet.
[13:35:34] <eddiemonge> mordof: its probably your network
[13:35:41] <mordof> sgrover: so it's not just me
[13:35:42] <mordof> ?
[13:35:56] <eddiemonge> mordof sgrover please pm your traceroutes
[13:36:00] <sgrover> looks like the hosting account has expired.
[13:36:19] <Zzaichik> eddiemonge:  Weak. I couldn't wait and got the iPHone 4s. meh. It's pretty cool. I liked my Evo rockin Cyanogenmod more.
[13:36:22] <mordof> eddiemonge: sec
[13:36:39] <anjen> it looks like the calendar is just being built using html. Stacks and stacks of <li>
[13:37:08] <eddiemonge> sgrover: it hasnt. the domain expired but its an administration issue that has been taken care of already
[13:37:18] <sgrover> I can ping the servers fine.
[13:37:28] <sgrover> soo, maybe just in a DNS update window?
[13:37:28] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: want a nexus s 4g with ics?
[13:37:42] <anjen> caseyd: I've seen something like that as a showcase for html5, fwiw, although I can't point to a webpage. jsut in passing
[13:37:45] <mordof> eddiemonge: i saw an IIS server error, and now it's changed to saying the domain has been reigstered at namecheap.com
[13:38:09] <sgrover> mordof: ditto here.
[13:38:12] <edelgado> So, what's a good pattern (method, technique) for finding close-by elements, for which you don't have an ID or even a unique class?
[13:38:26] <Eviltwin> edelgado: Completely depends
[13:38:32] <sgrover> edelgado: siblings()?
[13:38:41] <eddiemonge> danheberden: you around?
[13:38:46] <Zzaichik> eddiemonge: is that what you have? I wouldn't mind.. :p
[13:38:55] <edelgado> Hmm, I'm afraid it does depend. sgrover, it may not be a sibling...
[13:38:55] <caseyd> anjen, thanks
[13:38:58] <touki> Hi everybody !
[13:39:00] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: it is. im trying it out.
[13:39:05] <eddiemonge> Zzaichik: mind a pm?
[13:39:14] <Zzaichik> nope
[13:39:20] <eddiemonge> edelgado: siblings, closest, find
[13:39:26] <Eviltwin> edelgado: What's the use case?
[13:39:40] <sgrover> edelgado: it always depends.  details help.  But siblings is where I'd start.. or maybe parent()/parents()
[13:39:44] <touki> Is this expression correct ? $j(this).children('img').hide();
[13:39:44] <Eviltwin> Show us what you're trying to do
[13:39:58] <edelgado> Eviltwin: Sure thing. Let me write it down real quick.
[13:40:27] <eddiemonge> touki: depends on what you want
[13:40:33] <Eviltwin> The specifics of what you're trying to select
[13:42:06] <mdiamond> if I understand it correctly, using "ifModified: true" in AJAX requests will result in "data" being undefined if the response comes back "304 Not Modified"
[13:42:21] <anjen> caseyd:  and ty to you too. I need to get on a calendar for my work site. This IS the sort of thing my boss wants, and its a reminder to me
[13:42:33] <mdiamond> meaning I have to explicitly put in code to catch this and retrieve the data from jqXHR.responseText
[13:42:41] <mdiamond> this seems a bit cumbersome
[13:42:46] <danheberden> eddiemonge yo
[13:42:46] <mdiamond> or am I misunderstanding it?
[13:43:17] <caseyd> anjen, its a good looking calendar
[13:43:24] <eddiemonge> danheberden: namecheap seems to have turned off dns for jqui in some places
[13:43:28] <Eviltwin> mdiamond: I'm pretty sure XHR transparently follows 3xx
[13:43:33] <caseyd> anjen, i just load a public google calendar
[13:43:43] <danheberden> eddiemonge it's all fixed, but i think some dns servers cached the mistake
[13:43:44] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: not sure what you mean
[13:43:52] <anjen> I agree..overall, but Id need to revamp it for our purposes. I avoid the preloads from google
[13:44:00] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: I checked the source and jQuery will not populate the "data" param in the success callback if the result is 304
[13:44:01] <eddiemonge> danheberden: thats what i thought
[13:44:07] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: but it *will* call the success callback
[13:44:13] <eddiemonge> mordof: sgrover there you go. its a temp issue
[13:44:15] <anjen> (boss won't pay for the licensing and it's a commerical site)
[13:44:19] <touki> Thanks guys
[13:44:23] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: keep in mind this is just if "ifModified" is true
[13:44:29] <touki> Just ask, make me find the solution
[13:44:32] <mordof> hm?
[13:44:48] <Frantic> does anyone know of a jQuery library of how one might achieve something similiar to the uTorrent scheduler interface for picking time ranges within a week? See this image: http://i.imgur.com/4x3Su.png
[13:44:54] <anjen> touki, what's the "j" for?
[13:45:05] <anjen> I've never seen that syntax
[13:45:14] <mordof> oh
[13:45:19] <mordof> sucky :\
[13:45:25] <mordof> how long does a DNS cache flush take?
[13:45:36] <mordof> and could i trigger that myself
[13:45:37] <touki> anjen: I've read it's a solution  to avoid conflict : $j = jQuery.noConflict();
[13:45:42] <Eviltwin> "For 304 Not Modified responses that are a result of a user agent generated conditional request the user agent must act as if the server gave a 200 OK response with the appropriate content."
[13:45:51] <touki> anjen: i'm developping for WP
[13:45:54] <touki> (on)
[13:46:19] <anjen> touki:  $j(oh. ingenius. I guess I'll have to read up. yes, that sems reasonable as long as it's wrapped by something to refer $(this)
[13:46:38] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: that makes sense… but are you saying that the behavior I'm describing is the desired behavior, or that what I'm describing shouldn't be happening?
[13:47:25] <mdiamond> Eviltwin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L533
[13:47:29] <danheberden> eddiemonge the domain didn't auto-renew, so it went into their pending state thingy
[13:47:31] <Eviltwin> mdiamond: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/
[13:47:31] <touki> anjen: it was just an id mistake, but yeah the $j(this) stuff works well
[13:47:36] <Eviltwin> There's the XHR spec
[13:47:39] <danheberden> so it *had* a nameserver change to their parked locale
[13:47:39] <mdiamond> notice how "success" is not populated if it's not modified
[13:47:58] <mdiamond> right
[13:48:10] <mdiamond> look, I understand that the user agent should take care of populating the XHR data
[13:48:15] <mdiamond> but I'm also saying that the way jQuery wraps it
[13:48:23] <mdiamond> it calls my success callback with "undefined" as the data
[13:48:29] <mdiamond> and I have to manually retrieve it from the jqXHR
[13:48:38] <mdiamond> (which contains the data as per the spec)
[13:48:45] <mordof> i've never experienced that
[13:48:53] <mordof> 304's have always worked from for me with jquery
[13:48:53] <mdiamond> it only happens if "ifModified" is true
[13:48:58] <mdiamond> and the server comes back with a 304 Not Modified
[13:49:06] <mdiamond> check the github link I posted
[13:49:07] <mordof> mdiamond: so why do you want to do that?
[13:49:10] <mdiamond> the source makes it explicit
[13:49:20] <mdiamond> mordof: why do I want to do what? run it as "ifModified"?
[13:49:35] <mdiamond> mordof: I'd like to avoid unnecessary transfers
[13:50:16] <mdiamond> I just feel that jQuery could make it easier by populating the "data" variable even if the server returns 304
[13:50:20] <mdiamond> I'm just confused as to why it isn't
[13:50:43] <eddiemonge> what data is it going to populate? the server response hasnt changed
[13:51:03] <mordof> i suppose you want jquery to have an already-set-up cache system for you?
[13:51:51] <mdiamond> I don't need jQuery to have a cache set up, I'm just saying that the line "success = ajaxConvert( s, response );" should be present in the "if ( status === 304 )" fork of the code
[13:51:55] <mdiamond> but it isn't, so the response comes back undefined
[13:52:07] <mdiamond> I'm not asking jQuery to do any heavy lifting in terms of caching
[13:52:13] <mdiamond> I'm just saying, if it's 304, still give me the response
[13:52:21] <mdiamond> cached and returned by the user-agent
[13:52:30] <mdiamond> as it stands, I get undefined so I have to check and see if it's "notmodified"
[13:52:37] <mdiamond> then I have to go and retrieve/decode the response from the jqXHR object
[13:52:48] <mdiamond> which can get cumbersome when I have to put the same 2 lines of code in every success callback
[13:52:56] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: but what response should it give you? what data?
[13:53:07] <mdiamond> eddiemonge: the data in jqXHR.responseText, I would think
[13:53:16] <eddiemonge> which is not modified right?
[13:53:21] <mdiamond> since that's where I'm having to go dig it up
[13:53:29] <mdiamond> yes, I would assume so
[13:53:37] <edelgado> Eviltwin: Ok, this explains what I'm trying to do :-] https://skitch.com/edelgado-digium/g91xe/jquery-fun
[13:53:51] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: "The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields"
[13:53:54] <mdiamond> I'm guessing you're going to say my application should take care of caching this data so if I get a 304 I won't need to retrieve it from the success callback
[13:54:16] <mdiamond> I understand, but the data is still there in the jqXHR.responseText
[13:54:18] <danheberden> mdiamond you could just add the originalOptions object to your jqXHR?
[13:54:21] <mdiamond> because the user-agent takes care of caching and returning it
[13:54:24] <danheberden> mdiamond also, http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2123-Using-Deferred-Objects-In-jQuery-1-5-To-Normalize-API-Responses.htm
[13:54:34] <danheberden> might apply for you?
[13:54:40] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: jquery doesnt know what. and it may not be from the original request. you could have hit that page some other way first
[13:55:17] <mdiamond> eddiemonge: okay, that makes some sense… you're saying that the behavior from a 304 Not Modified is unpredictable and that jQuery might not have access to the data after all?
[13:55:35] <mdiamond> I was assuming that it could always be retrieved from jqXHR.responseText
[13:55:50] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: exactly. lets say your user hit that page before. now on ajax call to the same page the server responds with 304
[13:56:13] <eddiemonge> jquery never got an original response from it so it wont have any way of "caching" it
[13:56:46] <Eviltwin> edelgado: What about something like $(this).closest(".teaser-thumbnail-container").find("img")
[13:57:13] <mdiamond> eddiemonge: well I'm not saying jQuery would have cached it, I'm making the assumption that the user-agent would supply the cached response to jQuery
[13:57:23] <mdiamond> in the form of XHR.response
[13:57:23] <edelgado> Eviltwin: *thinking*
[13:57:26] <mordof> for UI dialog, is it just width and height properties specific in string with 'px' to determine the dialog size?
[13:57:35] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: nope. browser implementation is too finicky
[13:58:14] <edelgado> Eviltwin: Yeah let me take that for a spin, thanks :-]
[13:58:42] <eddiemonge> edelgado: thats where class or id or attribute come in handy
[13:58:54] <mordof> gaaah this is driving me crazy not having access to the docs!
[13:59:34] <mdiamond> eddiemonge: that's a shame… I haven't had any problems getting around it with "if (typeof data == "undefined" && status == "notmodified"){ data = jq.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseText); }"
[13:59:40] <mdiamond> but maybe I've just been lucky thus far
[14:00:11] <edelgado> eddiemonge: For sure. I cannot guarantee that the HTML structure will always be the same eiher, BTW. But Eviltwin's approach should do it. Taking it out for a test drive right now.
[14:00:19] <eddiemonge> mordof: temporarily you could add an entry like "205.186.146.156 jqueryui.com" to your /etc/hosts file
[14:00:31] <mordof> eddiemonge: ty
[14:00:40] <eddiemonge> mdiamond: yup, lucky.
[14:00:52] <mordof> RAWR
[14:01:03] <mordof> Temporarily unavailable, and will be online again shortly.!!!!!
[14:01:10] <mordof> gotta be kidding me, lol
[14:01:11] <danheberden> mordof - you'd have to add it to your hosts
[14:01:15] <mordof> k
[14:01:20] <danheberden> mordof - have you tried a incognito window?
[14:01:26] <danheberden> the browser will sometimes cache
[14:01:32] <danheberden> the dns
[14:01:50] <mordof> i've been removing cache regularly
[14:02:08] <eddiemonge> danheberden: network wide for mordof
[14:02:41] <danheberden> mordof - are you on a mac?
[14:03:05] <edelgado> Eviltwin: I like it. Rides nice. I'll take it. Thanks for your help!
[14:03:06] <mordof> danheberden: no, how does that change "network wide" either?
[14:03:07] <danheberden> (or linux box)
[14:03:13] <mordof> danheberden: linux and windows
[14:03:23] <danheberden> mordof was gonna ask you to `dig jqueryui.com`
[14:03:25] <danheberden>  for me
[14:03:31] <mordof> ah
[14:03:48] <danheberden> or nslookup
[14:03:49] * mordof checks it
[14:03:50] <danheberden> should work
[14:03:56] <black_warlock> hello peeps
[14:03:57] <mordof> oh hey
[14:04:03] <mordof> yeah, it gave back the right IP's
[14:04:18] <black_warlock> i have a little question
[14:04:19] <mordof> what does dig do?
[14:04:28] <sgrover> Is there any easy way to use a jqueryui dialog with icons on the buttons?
[14:04:48] <sgrover> Found some tips for adding icons after the fact, but that seems the wrong way to do it...
[14:04:54] <danheberden> mordof - checks the nameservers 'n stuff
[14:04:57] <mordof> danheberden: seems to be back up and running, lol
[14:04:59] <danheberden> so at least it's setup properly
[14:05:02] <black_warlock> got a string which open an ul or a div if the li has em inside
[14:05:05] <black_warlock> $('li:has(ul,div)').
[14:05:08] <mordof> danheberden: i think the dig occured after it started working xD
[14:05:14] <danheberden> mordof - lol
[14:05:18] <black_warlock> but how to open both if there are both ?
[14:05:23] <mordof> ah well
[14:05:30] <mordof> the dns must have updated itself
[14:06:01] <mordof> unless that command did it o.O
[14:06:14] <danheberden> enigmas of the universe
[14:06:20] <danheberden> or is that enema's
[14:06:20] <mordof> lol
[14:06:27] * mordof staggers
[14:10:12] <black_warlock> nobody knows ?
[14:10:32] <black_warlock> ho to write li.has(ul, div) or both ?
[14:10:51] <mordof> you could use a .add
[14:10:54] <mordof> black_warlock: -^
[14:11:08] * mordof shrugs
[14:11:17] <black_warlock> hu?
[14:11:50] <mordof> li.has(ul) .add li.has(div)
[14:12:08] <Raverix> black_warlock: $('li:has(ul), li:has(div')
[14:12:14] <mordof> or that
[14:12:17] <Raverix> black_warlock: $('li:has(ul), li:has(div)')
[14:12:56] <black_warlock> lemme try
[14:13:22] <sgrover> ui dialog.  Adding an icon to the button is only possible AFTER rendering the buttons?  Not possible when declaring the dialog settings?
[14:13:32] <black_warlock> but its the same
[14:13:46] <black_warlock> $('li:has(ul,div)')
[14:13:56] <black_warlock> but if there is a div wont show ul
[14:14:06] <Raverix> black_warlock: One second.
[14:14:19] <Raverix> Do you have a jsfiddle of this yet?
[14:14:40] <black_warlock> aye i had
[14:14:42] <black_warlock> sec
[14:14:53] <mordof> .add
[14:15:21] <mordof> $('li:has(ul)').add('li:has(li)')
[14:15:23] <black_warlock> here
[14:15:26] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/44/
[14:15:27] <mordof> i have no idea if that's a bad idea though
[14:15:31] <black_warlock> its a menu
[14:15:42] <black_warlock> a nice and clean menu
[14:16:29] <black_warlock> but if i need to put a Div inside the <li> before the <ul> it open only 1 the div
[14:17:08] * mordof stops trying
[14:17:28] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/ayjrt/1/
[14:17:34] <Raverix> This works perfectl.
[14:17:38] <mordof> black_warlock: do you only read when something is directed specifically at you?
[14:17:49] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/ayjrt/2/ As does this
[14:17:55] <Raverix> So, the selector is not your issue.
[14:18:44] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/ayjrt/4/ Mordof's solution does not work... not sure yet.
[14:18:58] <mordof> o.o really? lol
[14:19:15] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/ayjrt/5/
[14:19:17] <mordof> Raverix: you put li instead of div.. lol
[14:19:26] <Raverix> Yeah, I noticed and fixed in the example 5.
[14:19:35] <mordof> k :)
[14:19:49] <Raverix> mordof's technique also works, so once again, it's not the selector / jquery, but something else in your logic that's the issue here.
[14:20:29] <Raverix> mordof: I didn't put the li, you did ;)
[14:20:50] * mordof scrolls up
[14:21:00] <mordof> 'tis true
[14:21:07] <mordof> my mistake :)
[14:21:13] <Raverix> ;)
[14:21:24] <mordof> i was so distraught at feeling ignored, lol
[14:21:58] <Raverix> HE HE
[14:22:01] <Raverix> Ooops
[14:22:47] <edelgado> Eviltwin: One more question for you if you don't mind: https://skitch.com/edelgado-digium/g915a/more-jquery-fun
[14:24:00] <Eviltwin> A) No B) No
[14:24:10] <Eviltwin> Well
[14:24:18] <Eviltwin> As for A, if you know it's going to be a child, not a descendant
[14:24:25] <Eviltwin> You can use .children('img')
[14:24:47] <mordof> Eviltwin: is that any better than just doing $("img", this)?
[14:24:57] <someprimetime> edelgado: javascript's native length method will pretty much never give you any cross-browser problems
[14:25:03] <mordof> i suppose that still checks for descendants though
[14:25:05] <Eviltwin> $("img", this) runs $(this).find("img")
[14:25:11] <mordof> ok
[14:25:28] <Eviltwin> edelgado: Correction, JavaScript's native length method will never give you any cross-browser problems
[14:25:52] <mordof> man, if .length gave cross browser problems, we'd be in a world of hut
[14:25:54] <mordof> hurt*** lol
[14:26:20] <mordof> edelgado: what editor is that?
[14:26:25] <gnarf> length method?
[14:26:30] <gnarf> length property ;)
[14:26:40] <mordof> meh, details
[14:27:03] <someprimetime> yeah yeah property, attribute, method, action
[14:27:06] <someprimetime> they all run together after awhile
[14:27:22] <edelgado> Cool, thanks for your help all! :-]
[14:27:30] <someprimetime> especially when i'm doing pylons/cakephp/javascript all day
[14:27:37] <mordof> lol
[14:27:46] <mordof> edelgado: what editor are you using in that screenshot?
[14:27:47] <edelgado> mordof: TextMate
[14:28:19] <mordof> ah okie dokie
[14:28:22] <edelgado> mordof: And using Skitch to take the screenshot and anotate.
[14:28:37] * mordof nods
[14:29:40] <mordof> anyone know what jquery hooks it's mousemove onto to get the UI dialog to move even while the mouse is outside the browser window?
[14:29:41] <mrneeon> Hi! I'm having a problem with the fileupload plugin (https://github.com/weixiyen/jquery-filedrop) where i can't get a global variable into the data: object ? any ideas why?
[14:36:37] <TeddyMurray> how do you do a click(function(){}) event on a radio button?
[14:36:46] <TeddyMurray> its not triggering for some reason
[14:36:53] <zCoder> Hi, I'm looking for a freelancer for my project. I need an experienced developer in the following languages javascript - jquery - php - css - html - mysql and someone who is able to put in 4+ hours a day of work. Please PM me.
[14:37:12] <mordof> heh
[14:37:34] <chilversc> mrneeon: are you holding down the mouse button whilst moving?
[14:38:12] <mrneeon> it's not that.. On my page, i have a button thats sets the upload dir.. this is passed to the variable "current_dir".
[14:38:13] <ajpiano> zCoder: you can feel free to stop posting that over and over again
[14:38:27] <ajpiano> if you need to find a developer there are many other more fruitful and appropriate locations
[14:38:41] <mrneeon> I can read that fine (using console and some break points) but not withing the data: in this plugin
[14:39:02] <TeddyMurray> anyone know?
[14:39:07] <TeddyMurray> how do you do a click(function(){}) event on a radio button?
[14:39:20] <mordof> TeddyMurray: the same way you'd put it on any element..
[14:39:30] <TeddyMurray> it isn't triggering mordof
[14:39:57] <mordof> TeddyMurray: that doesn't mean that's not how you do it
[14:40:07] <mordof> TeddyMurray: pastebin your code
[14:40:10] <TeddyMurray> sure
[14:40:11] <TeddyMurray> one moment
[14:40:11] <mordof> (relevant code)
[14:41:03] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/GHwbZ5nf

[14:42:52] <nFFF> Cool to see facebook using jquery
[14:42:56] <TeddyMurray> any ideas mordof/
[14:43:01] <nFFF> on their photoviewer
[14:43:27] <mordof> hm, odd.
[14:43:31] <mordof> was sure it would work, sec
[14:44:39] <TeddyMurray> does it work for you?
[14:44:44] <mordof> no, lol
[14:44:46] <TeddyMurray> i think theres a bug ive had this problem before
[14:45:10] <TeddyMurray> i remember fixing it, i forget how
[14:46:21] <mordof> even .change() isn't working O.o
[14:46:54] <mordof> mnevermind
[14:46:59] <mordof> i had mootools in the fiddle, lol
[14:47:36] <mordof> TeddyMurray: .click does work for me
[14:48:08] <TeddyMurray> odd...
[14:48:33] <mordof> TeddyMurray: http://jsfiddle.net/xaeeg/
[14:49:22] <TeddyMurray> maybe its the jquery version
[14:49:33] <mordof> what version are you using?
[14:49:46] <mrneeon> http://pastebin.com/nvEQVv5r <- Anyone know where the value of my varibale has gone?
[14:49:51] <TeddyMurray> not sure
[14:51:45] <anjen> TeddyMurray: don't you have to initialize datepicker. I thought the showOn: button was the trip for opening the window
[14:53:33] <TeddyMurray> anjen, yeah i just deleted that line and it worked
[14:53:38] <TeddyMurray> how do i initialize the datepicker?
[14:53:40] <TeddyMurray> jqueryui is included
[14:54:32] <mib_mib> hi guys - i have a page where $(document).ready(function() { // my code }); is not executing, i checked beforehand that jquery is being loaded properly by just doing a console.log($) and it returns 'function()' - what could the problem be here?
[14:55:14] <chovy> mib_mib: got a url?
[14:55:30] <mib_mib> chovy: its on localhost right now, sry
[14:55:40] <anjen> TeddyMurray: an example from our code is http://pastebin.com/YRAGDtLq
[14:55:51] <chovy> mib_mib: pastie the js
[14:56:03] <chovy> mrneeon: i dont' see anything obvious.
[14:56:15] <anjen> granted the text never gets seen in that example, although I put it there for some reason I no longer remember
[14:57:49] <mib_mib> http://pastebin.com/Bpgawaii
[15:01:19] <anjen> TeddyMurray:   if you DON'T use the intializer, I think you can just do $(".datepicker").datepicker();
[15:02:39] <mrneeon> I have this var foo = {var1:'foo',var2:'bar'}  .. how can i add an item to that? foo.push({var3:'something'}) ?
[15:02:57] <chovy> mib_mib: does this run?
[15:02:58] <chovy>     console.log('doc is ready');
[15:04:10] <mib_mib> chovy: nope
[15:04:23] <mib_mib> the weird thing is that its just not running on this one page
[15:04:29] <mib_mib> but it runs on another one of my pages
[15:04:47] <chovy> mib_mib: is it in the footer?
[15:05:17] <mib_mib> chovy: no
[15:05:17] <anjen> did you forget to wrap it in a javascript tag?
[15:05:21] <mib_mib> chovy: the script is in the head
[15:05:33] <chovy> mib_mib: move it to the footer.
[15:05:41] <mib_mib> chovy: ok

[15:07:35] <mib_mib> chovy: i am getting one obscure error in firebug, but i dont think its related
[15:07:54] <mib_mib> chovy: the error is Security error" code: "1000
[15:08:05] <mib_mib> chovy: but thats in jquery.min.js
[15:08:30] <chovy> maybe that is causing the rest of the js to stop working.
[15:09:05] <mib_mib> chovy: nothing i can do about it though i'm just linking to jquery.min.js from google
[15:09:20] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please tell me how i can iterate through all the inputs of a form that have number as type?
[15:09:33] <chovy> try the non-min version and see what function it fails at.
[15:10:09] <chovy> Wiz_KeeD: $.each($("form input[type=number]"), function(i, x) { $(x).foo(); });
[15:13:30] <mib_mib> chovy: http://pastebin.com/s9R3ZB82
[15:14:00] <Wiz_KeeD> if i do alert x.val should it bring the value of the input out chovy ?
[15:14:16] <chovy> mib_mib: what version of jq?
[15:14:24] <mib_mib> 1.7.1

[15:15:15] <tetradon> hello everyone
[15:15:22] <tetradon> I have a small question:
[15:16:06] <tetradon> I'm trying to get two classes closest to another div
[15:16:19] <tetradon> However, the classes aren't children or the parent
[15:16:26] <chovy> mib_mib: i don't know. try downgrading see if it goes away.
[15:16:34] <mib_mib> chovy: it doesnt
[15:16:38] <Wiz_KeeD> chovy, ?
[15:16:43] <mib_mib> it hasnt been a problem in the past though
[15:16:44] <chovy> Wiz_KeeD: ?
[15:16:51] <mib_mib> maybe a problem with firebug
[15:16:57] <tetradon> I'm trying this: jQuery(this).parent().closest(['.col-left', '.col-right']);
[15:17:07] <chovy> Wiz_KeeD: your example looks good.
[15:17:09] <tetradon> but it gets an empty set
[15:17:29] <Iarfen> Hi
[15:17:44] <Iarfen> is there a function to stop javascript execution until an ajax request has been completed??
[15:17:44] <chovy> tetradon: try this .closest(".foo, .bar");
[15:18:01] <Wiz_KeeD> then i must have messed something up
[15:18:11] <chovy> Wiz_KeeD: jsfidel
[15:18:55] <tetradon> chovy: still getting an empty set
[15:19:11] <chovy> tetradon: jsfiddle
[15:19:21] <tetradon> chovy: okay
[15:19:27] <Wiz_KeeD> jsfiddle?
[15:20:29] <chovy> Iarfen: not really.
[15:20:43] <Iarfen> chovy: ok ty
[15:20:55] <chovy> You could do a set interval to check for a flag, but that's kind of stupid. Just put your code in the callback for the ajax request.
[15:22:11] <tetradon> Wiz_KeeD: jsfiddle.net
[15:22:25] <Wiz_KeeD> it worked thanks guys
[15:22:44] <tetradon> Wiz_KeeD: cool
[15:22:53] <Wiz_KeeD> now to extract 1 from index_1
[15:23:13] <Wiz_KeeD> equiv of strpos from php
[15:23:13] <kara_sweets> is there a way to change the direction of page transitions in jquery mobile?
[15:23:20] <chovy> 'index_1'.split('_')[1]
[15:23:26] <Wiz_KeeD> kara_sweets, yes there is, there are many
[15:23:38] <kara_sweets> googlin
[15:23:43] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4/docs/pages/docs-transitions.html
[15:23:46] <Wiz_KeeD> here you go
[15:24:04] <Wiz_KeeD> ahhh the wonderfull split
[15:24:11] <Wiz_KeeD> ecma script based, recognise this one
[15:24:17] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks chovy
[15:24:18] <Wiz_KeeD> !
[15:24:22] <chovy> np
[15:26:07] <Wiz_KeeD> don't think i recall such helpful people around jquery :)
[15:27:15] <Wiz_KeeD> so in this case if i have another input i want to check for  $.each($(".ui-block-a input[type=number]"), function(i, x)
[15:27:15] <Wiz_KeeD> i do $('.ui-block-a .input-class')
[15:27:16] <Wiz_KeeD> or do i use $this or some other thingy?
[15:28:49] <tetradon> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/gcDCQ/6/
[15:29:28] <kara_sweets> wiz_keed, how does posting to a form that has image data and text data on seperate 'pages' work in jquery mobile?
[15:29:28] <tetradon> Trying to remove columns with class col-left or col-right
[15:30:16] <Iarfen> how I can erase the text inside a textarea??
[15:31:00] <tetradon> I can't use  var obj = jQuery(this).parent().children(['.col-left', '.col-right']); because there could be more than just two col-left and col-right
[15:31:24] <Wiz_KeeD> i am not that experienced kara_sweets but to my knowledge the request gets automatically picked up and transformed into an ajax request, once the ajax request has been completed, data is beeing added to the dom and after that the transition effect which you pick takes place, this is done in order to make a "smooth transition"
[15:31:24] <Wiz_KeeD> but you can always google that and let me know if i'm mistaking :)
[15:31:27] <tetradon> Just want to delete the two children closest to the delete button that was clicked
[15:31:33] <Wiz_KeeD> and this is all done automatically by jquerymobile
[15:32:39] <kara_sweets> interesting, ok im gonna try to dig deeper, the key seems like the ajax request
[15:33:13] <anjen> closest sibling perhaps?
[15:34:04] <mib_mib> chovy: i tried it on google chrome and it works - weird
[15:38:37] <chovy> tetradon: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/gcDCQ/9/
[15:42:17] <tetradon> chovy: I'm trying to remove only the closest children to the class .delete-item. I should had included more col-lefts and col-rights in the html. sorry.
[15:42:51] <tetradon> chovy: so I just want to delete two children closest to the .delete-item that was clicked
[15:44:00] <laurenty> greetings folks
[15:44:33] <sontek> Whats a good jquery plugin for sliding in content?  for example I have 3 content divs, only want one to show at a time and when I click "next" the next one slides in from the right
[15:44:38] <laurenty> is there a way to get all the unselected items from Selectable in one call?
[15:46:19] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use the chosen plugin?
[15:46:57] <tetradon> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/gcDCQ/17/
[15:48:52] <sontek> ProLoser|Work: I love chosen :)
[15:48:56] <tetradon> chovy: actually I just realized the way I'm doing this is stupid, lol
[15:49:07] <ProLoser|Work> sontek: have you ever wanted to add like pictures or other info to it?
[15:49:14] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know the best way to approach that
[15:49:23] <ProLoser|Work> like i can't store html inside the <option> tag so i'm wondering what to do
[15:49:53] <tetradon> chovy: okay, I figured out what I need to do. Thanks for the help.
[15:50:39] <sontek> ProLoser|Work: nope, haven't tried that, but I have tweaked the styles of the textboxes and stuff
[15:50:45] <sontek> ProLoser|Work: its fairly small code if you open it up
[15:54:57] <ProLoser|Work> yes but try to imagine what i'm describing
[15:55:02] <ProLoser|Work> where would you store a link to the image?
[15:55:08] <ProLoser|Work> if you can't do it in html, how would you store it in data?
[15:55:20] <ProLoser|Work> hmm actually i suppose i could put stuff into data- attriburtes
[15:55:28] <Wiz_KeeD> is that, text in the input field dissapears on click, reappears on clickout and doesn't reappear if you click and change it's value a small script or should i write it from scratch?
[15:55:55] <ProLoser|Work> Wiz_KeeD: i use the placeholder attribute and say fuck you to older browsers
[15:55:58] <ProLoser|Work> or use a polyfill
[15:56:12] <Wiz_KeeD> i don't give a shit it's html5 anyway
[15:56:24] <ProLoser|Work> http://html5please.us/
[15:56:30] <Wiz_KeeD> what's placeholder attribute
[15:56:30] <Wiz_KeeD> or polyfill? :))
[15:56:33] <ProLoser|Work> type in placeholder and it'll recommend a polyfill
[15:56:38] <ProLoser|Work> it's called google man
[15:56:50] <ProLoser|Work> how can you use html5 and not know what placeholder is?
[15:57:11] <ProLoser|Work> you must be a designer :/
[15:57:37] <Wiz_KeeD> not really, am programmer, and use html5 cause jquerymobile uses it and i just found out some nifty tricks
[15:57:52] <ProLoser|Work> go read up on what's introduced in 5
[16:01:32] <Wiz_KeeD> roger that
[16:05:25] <laurenty> what do you guys think of this change? https://github.com/laurenty/jquery-ui/commit/46244b2b7dd7eac8cdd47444fb6730696bb8bb2a#ui/jquery.ui.selectable.js

[16:24:14] <mib_mib> I think I may be facing race conditions with loading my jquery js file and then loading another js file that has $(document).ready( //stuff) - how do i ensure jquery is loaded and executed first?
[16:25:01] <Wiz_KeeD> placeholder tags anyone?
[16:25:05] <Wiz_KeeD> i mean sorry
[16:25:06] <Wiz_KeeD> script
[16:34:02] <Gates> hi2u

[16:34:23] <Wiz_KeeD> nice one!
[16:43:36] <kelsoB> With the Validator plugin, I see that you can give a field the class "required" for it to be validated as such. Is it possible to declare other rules via CSS classes?
[16:43:51] <kelsoB> And what's the syntax for the arguments?
[16:50:38] <mib_mib> guys i cant solve this problem, need some help - the stuff inside my $(document).ready( function() { // stuff }); is not running - it works fine on chrome, but not on firefox
[16:50:56] <mib_mib> what could be going on?
[16:51:32] <mib_mib> the js is definitely valid, my only guess is that for some reason in firefox the jquery.js file is not fully executed before the $(document).ready() is called....
[16:51:47] <mib_mib> althought i tested it by doing console.log($) and it seems to be loaded fine
[17:19:39] <oojacoboo> man, delegation is a mess
[17:19:55] <oojacoboo> it's so much more reliable to just reload your function with your DOM content
[17:20:13] <oojacoboo> well, less error prone, less conflicts
[17:21:01] <astropirate> oojacoboo: say waht?
[17:21:07] <astropirate> thats terrible :p
[17:21:10] <oojacoboo> ?
[17:21:39] <oojacoboo> in a full ajax interface where binding has to be attached to certain elements, you're constantly on off things
[17:21:49] <oojacoboo> and just presents a host of issues
[17:22:11] <astropirate> deligation is soo much easier then  kicking off a function for every time you update the dom
[17:22:16] <oojacoboo> it can be done I realize, but trying to keep things straight and organized seems to be a nightmare
[17:22:26] <astropirate> deligation is what you want :)
[17:22:27] <oojacoboo> astropirate: I didn't say easier
[17:22:31] <astropirate> delegation*
[17:22:37] <astropirate> and less of a mess
[17:22:42] <oojacoboo> on is delegation
[17:22:57] <astropirate> so is delegate and live
[17:22:59] <astropirate> :D
[17:23:06] <oojacoboo> and I'm not talking about ease, I'm talking about overall maintenance and preventing conflicts
[17:23:12] <ngharo> delegation relies on event bubbling so if that's not working then youre doin it wrong
[17:23:14] <oojacoboo> what's your point ;)
[17:23:29] <oojacoboo> ngharo: it works, it also conflicts
[17:23:33] <oojacoboo> in a full ajax all
[17:23:36] <oojacoboo> app*
[17:24:01] <ngharo> doin it wrong
[17:24:01] <ngharo> lol
[17:24:02] <oojacoboo> try managing 50 pages that share DOM elements with delegation, it gets a little frustrating
[17:24:47] <astropirate> I have, and yes it does get complicated..  but its not a magic bullet, you have to use the right tool for the job
[17:24:48] <oojacoboo> if there a recursive undelegate function?
[17:24:56] <oojacoboo> is*
[17:26:25] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: ...what?
[17:26:36] <ngharo> wat
[17:27:00] <oojacoboo> undelegate all dem damn chillen
[17:27:16] <astropirate> wut
[17:27:36] <oojacoboo> OMG, are you peoples trolling hard or what?
[17:27:44] <oojacoboo> must not have been many bites today
[17:27:52] <ngharo> have you used .undelegate() before?
[17:28:05] <oojacoboo> ngharo: no, what does it do?
[17:28:37] <oojacoboo> isn't that where you remove an element from the web sights
[17:28:42] <ngharo> ?undelegate
[17:28:42] <bot-t> .undelegate(): Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[17:29:12] <oojacoboo> ngharo: but ngharo I want to remove from my web sights now
[17:29:23] <oojacoboo> not in the future
[17:30:32] <ngharo> it'll simply stay "unbound" until you bind it again
[17:30:54] <oojacoboo> ngharo: I'm fully aware of hot to bind and undelegate
[17:30:58] <oojacoboo> how*
[17:31:10] <oojacoboo> that's not even the issue or question I am presenting
[17:31:22] <oojacoboo> I'm talking about design patterns
[17:31:28] <ngharo> oh dear
[17:31:31] * ngharo shoots self
[17:31:52] <oojacoboo> did you even read what was said?
[17:32:15] <ngharo> i read a lot of whining and stuff
[17:32:21] <oojacoboo> yes, mostly
[17:32:22] <ngharo> maybe its the cold meds im hopped up on
[17:32:51] <oojacoboo> there was some complaining, but that's just b/c this shits annoying me
[17:33:07] <ngharo> i work on an ajax app every day
[17:33:19] <oojacoboo> twinsies
[17:33:21] <ngharo> when a page gets loaded, i fire a custom event notifying me
[17:33:32] <ngharo> which then calls undelegate on the page/module container
[17:33:49] <oojacoboo> you bind _everything_ to that object?
[17:34:09] <ngharo> what object
[17:34:20] <oojacoboo> page/module container
[17:34:34] <spyvsspy> hi, im going nuts
[17:34:49] <ngharo> oojacoboo: mostly
[17:35:01] <spyvsspy> can anyone tell me why, copiedEventObject.start, is not being sent to the server correctly
[17:35:02] <spyvsspy> https://gist.github.com/1764052
[17:35:05] <oojacoboo> if you stick with that method it works fine
[17:35:42] <oojacoboo> unfortunately that isn't the case with some of this code I'm working with, so I'd have to rewrite all my delegation
[17:35:47] <spyvsspy> it doesnt work even if I specify event[start]
[17:36:08] <spyvsspy> (the alert comes back w/ the correct values)
[17:38:13] <oojacoboo> spyvsspy: have you tried trigger?
[17:38:32] <spyvsspy> im pretty new
[17:38:37] <spyvsspy> what do you mean?
[17:38:41] <oojacoboo> ?trigger
[17:38:42] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:39:24] <ngharo> spyvsspy: how is it being sent?  have you checked the network tab of your dev tools?
[17:41:30] <asdf`> uh, so i want to load subpages with ajax, but i'd also like to use the JS that is on these subpages. Using .load("foo.html #bar") won't work, obviously. What's the Right Thing to do?
[17:42:11] <oojacoboo> asdf`: you could do that a number of ways
[17:42:19] <oojacoboo> I think lazy loading is the most proper
[17:42:34] <spyvsspy> https://gist.github.com/1763780#comments
[17:42:40] <spyvsspy> ngharo, thats the overview
[17:43:01] <asdf`> oojacoboo, how would i do that?
[17:43:36] <ngharo> spyvsspy: ok so rails is throwing an error?  did you check the data being sent in your network tab?
[17:43:37] <oojacoboo> asdf`: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/912711/jquery-to-load-javascript-file-dynamically
[17:43:41] <oojacoboo> maybe check that ot
[17:43:43] <oojacoboo> out*
[17:44:13] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/ asdf`
[17:45:19] <asdf`> oojacoboo, uh, but i want to use JS that is embedded in the .load()-ed page. Using .load with a target selector strips the page of all <script>s. Should i put the scripts i want to load with ajax in separate files?
[17:45:42] <oojacoboo> asdf`: separate files, yes
[17:45:57] <oojacoboo> you could put them in those pages if you wanted and save a server request
[17:46:01] <oojacoboo> but I don't recommend that
[17:47:20] <asdf`> oojacoboo, but then i'd have to know these files filenames. I can just make every 'foo.html' go with a 'foo.js', but that's not quite general. How would i extract the js files filenames from a .load()-ed page?
[17:47:28] <acidjazz> how do i remove all occurances of a class
[17:47:31] <acidjazz> not knowing where it is
[17:47:39] <acidjazz> $(document).remvoeCLass('like this') ?
[17:47:56] <oojacoboo> asdf`: add a comment on the page or use php or whatever backend lang to include the file in the page?
[17:49:11] <chovy> acidjazz: $(document).find('.foo').removeClass('foo');
[17:49:33] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").removeClass("foo")
[17:49:37] <Eviltwin> Wouldn't that work?
[17:49:39] <chovy> doh
[17:49:45] <chovy> what am i thinking. yes.
[17:51:32] <chovy> sontek: you don't really need a plugin for that.
[17:51:38] <ngharo> asdf`: jquery will automatically eval encountered <script> tags found in the response
[17:53:09] <asdf`> ngharo, uh, it doesn't seem to do that, not with a .load('foo.html #target') call. Please look at this paste: http://bpaste.net/show/23155/
[17:53:52] <sontek> chovy: to have it animate I would
[17:54:11] <chovy> sontek: I can show you an example.
[17:54:47] <chovy> asdf`: you could give your script tag and id, and then grab the src attribute.
[17:55:23] <ngharo> asdf`: the docs say load() with a selector does not execute scripts
[17:56:25] <sontek> chovy: :D
[17:56:40] <ngharo> asdf`: you can use .ajax()
[17:58:29] <asdf`> ngharo, oh, and then get the things i need out of the resulting data with a $('div.whatever', data)?
[17:58:37] <acidjazz> chovy: graci
[17:59:01] <ngharo> asdf`: yeah pretty much
[17:59:27] <heshanh> how do i select the element above
[17:59:48] <heshanh> or before / previous
[18:00:00] <kborchers> ?prev @ heshanh
[18:00:00] <bot-t> heshanh, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[18:00:18] <heshanh> ah, thank you
[18:00:28] <ngharo> i love when the answer is in the question
[18:00:41] <kborchers> heh
[18:00:52] <ngharo> y u no read docs!?
[18:00:54] <asdf`> great. Thanks, ngharo, oojacoboo, chovy!
[18:01:21] <chee> abjorn: needs more abjorn
[18:03:07] <abjorn> lol
[18:04:35] <sontek> You guys know how I can use jquery.validate on a dynamic site?  It wants me to $(".selector").validate() but i'm dynamically adding the form, so onready it doesn't exist yet
[18:05:51] <chee> abjorn: that's more like it. everyone in here is talking about some javascript thing
[18:06:58] <imanc> does anyne know of a stable alterantive to jquery tmpl?
[18:07:23] <snover> imanc: underscore.
[18:07:35] <sontek> imanc: handlebars.js
[18:07:48] <abjorn> still netsplattan
[18:07:49] <sontek> imanc: hogan.js
[18:08:05] <sontek> imanc: dust.js
[18:08:15] <imanc> jesus
[18:08:32] <sontek> imanc: handelbars.js is my favorite, hogan.js is twitter's thing, dust.js is linkedin's thing
[18:08:39] <imanc> i just need basic templacing placeholders with values in an object - which is the best, most stable etc.?
[18:08:47] <sontek> imanc: underscore.js is also good but I don't like the way it looks
[18:08:58] <sontek> imanc: hogan.js is logicless
[18:08:59] <imanc> oh great - thanks sontek
[18:11:31] <oojacoboo> well, that was fun
[18:13:59] <Cliffer> why does $(object).hasClass("green").css("border", "2px solid green"); dont work? ($(object).hasClass("green").css is not a function)
[18:14:12] <fission6> how can i make this modal not drop down from the top of the screen http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[18:14:30] <danzik17> Cliffer: hasClass returns a boolean, not a jQuery object.  it's not chainable like that.
[18:15:11] <Cliffer> danzik17 thx, but is there anythink chainable? .is("green")?
[18:16:02] <danzik17> Cliffer: you only want to to the css modification on members of $( object ) with class green?
[18:16:06] <danzik17> to do*
[18:17:10] <chee> so much netsplit
[18:17:54] <Cliffer> danzik17 easy, it works. thx
[18:20:05] <chovy> acidjazz: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/yaSzk/2/
[18:20:17] <chovy> sorry,l sontek http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/yaSzk/2/
[18:20:47] <chovy> there's something wrong with the scroll animation, but I know it's possible. I did it on a site of mine the other day (going off memory here).
[18:22:08] <chovy> sontek: i figured it out: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/yaSzk/
[18:22:27] <sontek> chovy: its not doing anything in chrome
[18:22:37] <sontek> other than console.log(200)
[18:23:07] <heshanh> how do i find if there are any more next() elements?
[18:23:39] <chovy> sontek: try the 2nd url now.
[18:24:00] <Eviltwin> heshanh: You try again
[18:24:18] <heshanh> what do u mean try again?
[18:24:28] <chovy> sontek: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/yaSzk/ works for me in chrome.
[18:24:38] <sontek> chovy: that one works
[18:26:48] <sontek> Is there an event that gets fired when content is changed on the dom so I can re-hook up validate?
[18:26:53] <heshanh> i have 3-4 divs, and one of them is always visible, the next/pre buttons basically check to see which one is :visible, hides it and show() the next or prev element.
[18:26:57] <Eviltwin> sontek: no
[18:27:21] <heshanh> the issue is if the very first element is :visible and someone clikcsthe prev button everything goes outa whack
[18:27:22] <sontek> So I should just call validate when I had the new content
[18:27:40] <Eviltwin> heshanh: If you want to see if the next element had a next element, you do exactly thar
[18:27:44] <Eviltwin> that*
[18:28:49] <heshanh> i see, leme try that
[18:30:59] <heshanh> ty, tha worked :D
[19:22:49] <krucial> If I have lets say, a div called #parentDiv, and a child of that div.. #childDiv.. what selector can I use to just get #parentDiv without #childDiv?  I JUST want the parent object, not the parent object including the child object
[19:24:44] <ajpiano> you can't
[19:24:56] <ajpiano> unless you want to actually get the parent object and then pull the child out of it
[19:25:07] <ajpiano> containers, by definition, contain the elements that are inside of them
[19:25:38] <oojacoboo> krucial: that doesn't make sense
[19:26:03] <oojacoboo> if you want something that seems that way from a layout perspective, look into position: absolute/fixed with another relative parent
[19:26:10] <krucial> so, I have a div that has elements inside of it, and I want a click event on all but a few child elements
[19:26:31] <ajpiano> krucial: then you want to just do some filtering
[19:26:48] <krucial> ok, i'll look into filtering.
[19:26:49] <krucial> thank you
[19:26:55] <oojacoboo> krucial: assign them a special class
[19:26:59] <oojacoboo> to make life easier
[19:27:16] <ajpiano> $("#parentDiv").children().not("#whatever").click(fn);
[19:27:21] <oojacoboo> check out :not "jquerified selector"
[19:27:34] <krucial> see but that excludes the parentDiv itself
[19:27:37] <krucial> ajpiano
[19:28:02] <ajpiano> i would probably handle it all on parentdiv itself, personally
[19:28:17] <ajpiano> yr right though
[19:29:31] <ajpiano> var childDiv = $("#childDiv");  $("#parentDiv").click(function(e) { if (!$.contains( childDiv[0], e.target) {  /* the event didn't happen in the childDiv */ }   });
[19:29:44] <ajpiano> and just let all the evnets in the thing bubble up
[19:29:59] <ajpiano> krucial: what i am saying is there are like at least several diferent viable ways to approach your problem
[19:30:14] <ajpiano> none of which involve doing the impossible :p
[19:30:21] <krucial> right
[19:30:27] <krucial> thanks for your time
[19:30:31] <ajpiano> no prob
[19:46:42] <fission6> what does this mean, !function( $ ){
[19:47:24] <tw2113> probably testing if $ is an aliased function to jquery
[19:49:43] <fission6> how so?
[19:49:53] <tash> I'm having some issues with cache.  And I don't know if it is something I can fix with jquery or if it's server side :( I'm making some ajax calls and on return am creating a new table on the page.  In FF this works perfectly.  In IE, I have to force IE to always refresh from server, which obviously isn't kosher.
[19:49:56] <tash> any tips for me?
[19:54:29] <coldboot|air> Is there any way you can get the full source of an element, including itself? Something like this: $('<div>foo</div>').get_source() => outputs '<div>foo</div>'; ?

[20:17:50] <sdwrage> Hey all. If I call the click method on a div, how can I target an input within that clicked div?
[20:18:24] <sdwrage> $(".colorbox").click(function(){ // need to select a radio button as the selected radio})
[20:20:10] <Eviltwin> sdwrage: $(this).find("...")
[20:20:18] <sdwrage> ah okay.
[20:20:22] <sdwrage> how would I select the radio?
[20:20:40] <Eviltwin> Do you know how to make a CSS selector for a radio button?
[20:28:54] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/5ca7de643fa3ac598026
[20:29:15] <sdwrage> I only need to select input. I am not picky in this situation
[20:29:20] <sdwrage> but this doesn't seem to work
[20:29:34] <sdwrage> if I remove the first line in the event handler, it alerts fine
[20:29:48] <sdwrage> ohh
[20:29:50] <sdwrage> hold on
[20:30:48] <Eviltwin> Waiting for you to see the difference between what you wrote and what I wrote
[20:31:03] <coldhead> is it the font?
[20:31:32] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/5ca7de643fa3ac598026
[20:31:47] <dv310p3r> What happens when you run a .load() on an element that doesn't exist? I don't get any errors.
[20:31:50] <Eviltwin> Better but not quite
[20:31:57] <Eviltwin> dv310p3r: Nothing happens
[20:32:06] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: hrm… I can't figure out what I am doing wrong lol
[20:32:23] <sdwrage> -_-
[20:32:25] <Eviltwin> sdwrage: I want you to count how many ('s there are in that code
[20:32:25] <sdwrage> I see it
[20:32:26] <sdwrage> sorry
[20:32:28] <Eviltwin> Then count how many )'s there are
[20:32:33] <dv310p3r> Eviltwin, no errors, no background log, anything?
[20:32:33] <sdwrage> me being an idiot
[20:32:35] <Eviltwin> Then subtract the latter from the former
[20:33:03] <dv310p3r> Eviltwin, Thanks a million!
[20:33:19] <Eviltwin> dv310p3r: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L162-165
[20:33:47] <Eviltwin> If it's acting on an empty collection, it doesn't do anything
[20:34:23] <dv310p3r> Eviltwin, got it. Thanks a million! Make perfect sense.
[20:48:42] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: got it working :)
[20:48:46] <sdwrage> Thanks
[20:52:36] <progrock> can anyone explain why $.map returns an array like object, not an array, when returning things like numbers and strings (basically, not jquery dom elements)
[21:17:11] <aqeel> guys which root should one go if too many options provide themselves....
[21:18:00] <aqeel> using div and stcking in html via position and zindex ...hiding all but one and with jquery show hide what is needed....
[21:18:23] <aqeel> or should trend to jquery and use hover with html/text to do this job...
[21:18:51] <aqeel> well html will ssure get messy and hack of load time will be taken for sure...
[21:19:12] <aqeel> so what u people say
[21:20:38] <Eviltwin> progrock: $.map or $(".foo").map ?
[21:20:57] <balr0g> this makes sense?: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/547633/
[21:21:08] <aqeel> previously i did was ........put all my div in seperate page and use the load from jquqery but was hack of lag time to load contents...
[21:21:23] <Eviltwin> Sure
[21:21:28] <progrock> Eviltwin:  $('.foo')map  ... which I guess youre gonna say it returns the same datatype it started with, right?
[21:21:39] <Eviltwin> progrock: Yeah, it produces a jQuery object as the output
[21:21:41] <aqeel> hover with html / text though seems much better...
[21:21:50] <progrock> Eviltwin: tho on that note, can I use $.map  on a jquery object to produce a normal array?
[21:21:51] <Eviltwin> You can tack .get() on the end to convert the jQuery object to a regular array
[21:22:00] <Eviltwin> Yes, $.map produces a normal array
[21:22:01] <progrock> oh, i was unawarre
[21:22:04] <progrock> awesome
[21:22:48] <progrock> my toher gripe is that filter, map, etc. don;t stick to JS standards (referring to the arguments)
[21:23:15] <Eviltwin> What JS standards?
[21:24:40] <progrock> Eviltwin: I suppsoe the one defined in ECMA Script (5?)... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[21:24:58] <Eviltwin> What in particular?
[21:25:10] <astropirate> ohh you mean setting methods to global objects?
[21:25:14] <ajpiano> progrock: fwiw, those method's signatures predate the existence of those methods being added to the spec
[21:25:22] <astropirate> Yah, i woudln't touch that with a 10 foot pole
[21:25:25] <ajpiano> and it would be impossible for jquery to reverse the argument order
[21:25:35] <ajpiano> without breaking BC all over the place
[21:25:57] <progrock> the arguemnts  element, index, array
[21:26:25] <progrock> ajpiano: ahh, makes sense.. definitely sucks when youre using both
[21:26:33] <ajpiano> i mean, sorta
[21:26:40] <ajpiano> you get used to it
[21:26:57] <Eviltwin> It is still kind of annoying when you're going back and forth between $.each'es and $.map's
[21:26:58] <progrock> of course, but definitely easier when they are the same
[21:27:28] <ajpiano> i feel like if i added up all the time i've spent having to pause to remember arg order
[21:27:43] <ajpiano> when using jquery and native methods/methods that use the same signatures
[21:27:48] <ajpiano> i might have like, 4 more minutes
[21:27:50] <ajpiano> in my life
[21:27:59] <ajpiano> and even that is generous
[21:28:06] <aqeel> c u room got to go bye
[21:28:07] <progrock> heh, I probably have closer to 2 hours this year alone, if not more.  which is already hundreds of dollars
[21:28:21] <iamcurio> i have an img tag in a div and i want to add a rel= atirubte how do i do that with jquery? do i use .append?
[21:28:43] <progrock> by this year I mean last year, obv too early in this year fo that much
[21:28:44] <ajpiano> ?attr(...,...) @ iamcurio
[21:28:45] <bot-t1> iamcurio, .attr(attributeName, value): Set one or more attributes for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[21:29:04] <iamcurio> cheers
[21:29:25] <Eviltwin> ?load(...,...,...)
[21:29:26] <bot-t1> .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:29:30] <Eviltwin> Where is that documented?
[21:31:35] <chovy> $("#footer").load('/footer.htm');
[21:31:53] * chee rs?
[21:38:34] <someprimetime> so i'm pulling a div container in with ajax() and it's a bunch of <li>s .. i want to target the first one and apply a margin-left on it before i append it to the document that called it
[21:38:41] <someprimetime> but it's not allowing me to apply that rule
[21:39:36] <someprimetime> it looks basically like: $fetchedContent = $(data)find('.infinite-container ul').contents(); $fetchedContent.first('li').css('margin-left', '40px').appendTo('.container');
[21:39:42] <someprimetime> is this the right approach?
[21:40:09] <pifantastic> hmm
[21:40:17] <pifantastic> I dont think you need .contents()
[21:40:27] <chovy> $fetchedContent.find("li:nth-child(1)")?
[21:40:29] <someprimetime> well it's a ul
[21:40:32] <pifantastic> also
[21:40:33] <someprimetime> and i just want the li's
[21:40:37] <someprimetime> which is why i used that
[21:40:44] <pifantastic> also
[21:40:52] <pifantastic> you're going to be appending the first li to container
[21:41:00] <someprimetime> right
[21:41:03] <pifantastic> I hope thats what you intend
[21:41:04] <pifantastic> also
[21:41:12] <pifantastic> just add a class to it :/
[21:41:13] <someprimetime> i want to append it, but just with a specific margin on it
[21:41:40] <pifantastic> no reason to use JS here unless you have no control over the markup
[21:47:22] <someprimetime> so this is the returned object called $fetchedContent
[21:47:23] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/VqxRX.png
[21:47:31] <someprimetime> how can i target that first node?
[21:47:42] <someprimetime> $fetchedContent[0] doesn't seem to work
[21:49:38] <someprimetime> nm got it
[21:49:44] <someprimetime> $fetchedContent[0].nextSibling
[22:03:32] <methoddk> I'm trying to use a regexp replace in a for loop, but when it matches one time, it just quits and doesn't finish the loop
[22:03:38] <methoddk> any reasons why?
[22:05:25] <IgnisDiabolus> methoddk, maybe when it replaces something it makes an error on the for logic
[22:05:48] <methoddk> i was thinking that, couldn't find anything
[22:05:57] <IgnisDiabolus> methoddk, jsfiddle.net?
[22:11:57] <methoddk> posting just a sec
[22:12:28] <niftylettuce_> whats the best way to disable a stylesheet cross-browser down to IE6? $('#my-stylesheet]').prop('disabled',true); ?
[22:12:45] <niftylettuce_> $('#my-stylesheet') **
[22:16:42] <IgnisDiabolus> $('link#my-stylesheet').remove();
[22:33:24] <oojacoboo> does your document need to be defined as html5 in order to use data attributes?
[22:33:59] <oojacoboo> I'm having a hard time pulling one in
[22:34:05] <oojacoboo> from the html
[22:34:53] <oojacoboo> actually, I think I have an idea
[22:35:16] <Xotix> hi
[22:35:35] <Xotix> is it possible to add a eventhandler to some content of a textarea?
[22:36:56] <Eviltwin> You can add an event handler to a text area...
[22:37:02] <Eviltwin> textarea*
[22:38:32] <IgnisDiabolus> oojacoboo http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6226913/detecting-html5-data-attribute-in-modernizr
[22:38:34] <Xotix> Yes, but i mean if the Content of my textarea is "Hello, I'm happy" i'd like to have"happy" clickable. Or something which goes into that direction.
[22:39:14] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: not using modernizr :/
[22:39:24] <IgnisDiabolus> use modernizr to detect browser support for html5 features. makes it easier
[22:39:30] <astropirate> Xotix: i don't think that is possible
[22:39:40] <oojacoboo> yea
[22:39:52] <astropirate> unless you are using a unispace fon't and can calcualte it
[22:39:55] <astropirate> but dont' do that :)
[22:41:11] <Xotix> hm ok
[22:41:32] <Xotix> But can i partially style the content of the textarea?
[22:44:32] <Eviltwin> Xotix: No, I don't believe you can
[22:44:42] <Eviltwin> But look into "content editable"
[22:44:55] <mindis|wurk> or designmode iframe
[22:47:38] <Xotix> hmm, tricky. so how are al lthese content editors made? Do they do some fake with a div and textarea?
[22:48:22] <mindis|wurk> iframe or div
[22:48:30] <mindis|wurk> even google's mail editor uses an iframe
[22:48:55] <Xotix> Why iframe? I do't like iframes
[22:49:00] <mindis|wurk> personally i use a div since having many iframes seemed to explode IE9
[22:49:13] <mindis|wurk> iframe sandboxes the content better and offers more control
[22:49:36] <Xotix> So i could make a div. On click i connect it with a textarea. Simulate the blinking pipe and i got my basic editor?
[22:50:12] <mindis|wurk> a contenteditable div is essentially already the equivalent of textarea
[22:50:32] <nights> hi
[22:50:48] <nights> im having some trouble using jquery UI
[22:50:52] <Xotix> but there i can add spans for making some text clickable, different styling etc. For e.g. hyperlinks.
[22:50:55] <nights> which i believe is sort of a timing issue
[22:51:25] <mindis|wurk> though some care has to be taken as it behaves slightly differently from browser to browser. for example, when pressing enter some browsers create a <br>, some create <p> and yet others do a <div>
[22:52:38] <mindis|wurk> and depending on how you want to define the areas of interaction, you will also run into crossbrowser compatibility problems when selecting the text
[22:52:55] <mindis|wurk> and usual, the problem lies with IE
[22:52:58] <Xotix> But i can overwrite those things so everyone does a br right? ContentEditable is a property of a div by default? How compatible is it with the browsers?
[22:53:00] <mindis|wurk> *as usual
[22:53:13] <mindis|wurk> contenteditable was introduced ine IE5
[22:53:35] <Xotix> I don't need to select text.
[22:53:49] <Xotix> ok thanks a lot!
[22:54:23] <nights> when loading jquery content by ajax, how can i make sure that document.ready works? (so i init my objects when ALL the page have finished loading)
[22:54:33] <mindis|wurk> Xotix np, i've spent quite a few hours researching this topic as it is relevant to my project(s)
[22:55:53] <Xotix> ajax doesn't trigger document ready.
[22:56:24] <nights> hm
[22:56:37] <nights> does the browser provide it?
[22:56:57] <nights> i have a webpage where jquery ui tabs work 30% of the page loads
[22:57:15] <nights> quite unpredictable and perhaps related to timing of loading scripts i thought
[22:58:57] <Xotix> I'm using tabs. I've read about ppl having problems doing $(#x).tabs(); within ready but i can't help you. I think i got it outside of ready or myabe i use window load.
[23:01:13] <mindis|wurk> how strange that <button> automatically works as a submit in firefox at least
[23:02:23] <nights> Xotix: hm, how do you load them if not inside document ready+
[23:05:39] <Xotix> I got it like that, but it is similar to ready() http://pastebin.com/0X0cehhq hmm, but there were some other people having trouble liek that with tabs. If the tabs are static it should work, if you change them via ajax you might need to reinit them…You could try $(window).load() (e.g. it makes sure, images are loaded) but I'm also not the uber pro.
[23:05:50] <nights> hmm
[23:05:51] <nights> i see
[23:05:57] <nights> thanks very much
[23:06:08] <Xotix> Check stackoverflow.com
[23:06:10] <nights> i change them with ajax
[23:06:20] <srj55> i have a page that has a full screen iframe and I want to transition the iframe from one 'src' to another 'src'.  Are there any plugins that make cool transitions?  Right now I have fadeout/fadein.  Can I do anything else?
[23:07:41] <astropirate> srj55: yes, you can set set the source to an empty html file on the server, making sure its under the same (sub)domain. Then you can inject your javascript into it
[23:07:58] <nights> Xotix: this is the page failing btw.
[23:08:01] <astropirate> making it do what ever
[23:09:33] <srj55> astropirate:  yes.  i have 2 html files (same domain).  and I am able to transition from one to the other.  HOWEVER, can I do any cool effects when transitioning?
[23:09:49] <astropirate> srj55: sure
[23:10:04] <astropirate> you can do lots of crazy, wonderful effects with javascript
[23:10:15] <Xotix> nights hm?
[23:10:53] <srj55> astropirate:  any jquery plugins that have these transitions already built in?  slides, zoom slides, etc...
[23:10:57] <mindis|wurk> thanks to the fucked up nature of web design though, those effects often end up being just crazy ;P
[23:11:34] <StevenCodes22> i hate plugins you can write less code if you make it yourself
[23:11:38] <astropirate> srj55: no but they are dirt easy to make
[23:13:44] <srj55> astropirate:  if I wanted to have a transition where both src frames are (temporarily) on the viewport at the same time (e.g. a slide), I would need two iframes for this, correct?  Since changing the iframe src won't allow both src's simultaneously
[23:14:12] <astropirate> srj55: yup
[23:24:12] <intellilogic> <th data-aj="{"TblOrderBy":"item_name"}">  How can I make a selector for this?
[23:25:46] <Xotix> How can i position a absolute div on the coordinates i get from e.pageX? e.pageX doesn't output px or %, but top,left etc. just accept % or px, right? Or have i missed something?
