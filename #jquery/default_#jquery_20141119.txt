[01:09:18] <krz> trying to create the following functionality. user types on an input box. timer starts. if user continues to type. timer is reset to 0. when user stops typing and timer reaches 3 seconds or higher. it console logs "Saved". what do i need for this?
[01:10:52] <Cork> krz: if(timer) { clearTimeout(timer); } timer = setTimeout(action, 3000);
[01:13:48] <krz> Cork: well if i type several times, it doesnt wait 3 seconds
[01:13:58] <krz> it just displays it immediately
[01:14:03] <Cork> no
[01:14:08] <Cork> the if case should prevent that
[01:14:25] <Cork> note that the timer variable needs to be shared between the events
[01:14:26] <Cork> not local
[01:16:00] <krz> Cork: https://gist.github.com/17347b95c2edc6fad8de
[01:16:09] <krz> just outputs Saving on every key up
[01:16:13] <krz> doesnt wait

[01:25:09] <krz> how is it any different from mine though
[01:25:27] <AcidRain2012> what file are you trying to spam text to?
[01:25:40] <Cork> krz: you forgot to wrap the call in setTimeout in a function

[01:27:51] <Oka> CoffeeScript makes me feel a little ill, not going to lie.
[01:28:04] <Cork> ya, i hate it with a passion
[01:30:16] <dan_j> Hi. I'm looking for a message box that can be set to appear for a few moments and then fade. It will be used to tell the user that something has been saved. Is there anything using jquery that would do that?
[01:31:06] <Cork> dan_j: not build into core no, but you should be able to find plenty of plugins that provide it
[01:34:38] <krz> thanks guys. that works
[01:35:33] <dan_j> Here seems to be loads of plugins but ive tried a few and cant get them to work. I assume its because im using the wrong version of jquery because other plugins ive used worked fine. Can anyone recommend one that theyve used successfully>
[01:35:38] <dan_j> ?
[01:36:27] <Cork> dan_j: you could do something simple as .show(150).delay(10000).hide(150);
[01:36:39] <Cork> on an element with the content you can to show
[01:36:45] <Cork> then you don't need a plugin at all
[01:36:54] <Cork> sure, it doesn't to everything you need on it's own
[01:37:03] <Cork> but should be simple enough to get working
[01:37:08] <FilipNortic> and most template engines have built in support for flash-messages that said nothing worng with using jQuery
[01:41:43] <Aristy> Hi guys, I have an object literal as follows: "{ aaa: 1, bbb: 2, ccc: 3}"
[01:42:06] <Aristy> How can I loop through each of them and get an array like [1,2,3] ?
[01:42:35] <Aristy> I've tried Object.keys(this.literal).forEach(function(thing) { }
[01:42:46] <Aristy> but it gets the keys only (e.g aaa, bbb, ccc)
[01:44:10] <Cork> Aristy: $.each(obj, function(key) { this == value })'
[01:45:15] <Aristy> Cork: Thanks, can I also learn how it can be done in plain javascript?
[01:46:03] <Cork> Aristy: for(key in obj) { if(obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) { obj[key] == value } }
[01:46:40] <Cork> at least if you want it to be cross browser
[01:47:23] <_rgn> var obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }; Object.keys(obj).map(function(k) { return obj[k]; } );
[01:47:36] <Cork> map isn't cross browser
[01:47:47] <sacho> that's what shims are for.
[01:48:10] <Cork> sacho: if you load jquery that already have a shim for it
[01:48:14] <Cork> why load a second shim?
[01:48:47] <Aristy> Cork: What kind of browsers are we talking about with map function?
[01:48:50] <sacho> he asked how to do it in "plain javascript"
[01:49:03] <Aristy> IE9 and below?
[01:49:21] <Cork> sacho: the for loop is plain js
[01:49:35] <Cork> Aristy: pre ie9
[01:49:42] <Cork> (had to look it up)
[01:49:49] <sammych> caniuse
[01:50:00] <Aristy> I always forget about caniuse, sorry
[01:50:38] <Aristy> I'm a fan of map/closures, but we have strict company rules about ancient browsers, so I gotta go with Cork's for loop
[01:50:46] <Aristy> Thanks for the help guys! <3

[03:04:10] <snesaha> hi
[03:04:53] <snesaha> how to handle status code ranges in jquery ajax
[03:05:03] <snesaha> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10042040/jquery-ajax-statuscode-else
[03:05:14] <snesaha> need to handle a status code range
[03:06:05] <snesaha> anyone help
[03:06:58] <shebbi> ?
[03:07:09] <snesaha> how to handle status code ranges in jquery ajax
[03:07:15] <snesaha>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10042040/jquery-ajax-statuscode-else
[03:07:21] <snesaha> need to handle a status code range
[03:08:20] <Cork> snesaha: define an error handler and check the status there
[03:09:24] <snesaha> but i can call a function for a particular status code
[03:09:37] <snesaha> i want to call a singlr response for a range of status code
[03:09:50] <Cork> snesaha: you either define a function for a code
[03:10:03] <Cork> or use generic one and check the code your self
[03:10:48] <Cork> or if you desperately don't want to use a generic error handler
[03:11:04] <Cork> write an extension that takes ranges and defines the generic error handler for you
[03:11:20] <snesaha> but is there any way to specify a range in statusCode: rather than a single error code
[03:11:27] <Cork> ...
[03:11:29] <snesaha> ok i am not sure how to do that
[03:11:47] <Cork> snesaha: why do you so desperately want to avoid the generic error handler?
[03:12:02] <snesaha> how to write this extension i am not sure..
[03:12:25] <Cork> snesaha: just use the .fail callback
[03:12:30] <Cork> and check the status code
[03:12:34] <Cork> don't over complicate things...
[03:13:09] <snesaha> but .fail would only take error code.. i want all possible http status code
[03:13:18] <Cork> uh...
[03:13:20] <Cork> no
[03:13:27] <snesaha> different ranges point to different functions
[03:13:34] <Cork> .fail is called when a none 2xx response is returned
[03:13:39] <Cork> well except for 3xx
[03:13:44] <Cork> as xhr doesn't expose those
[03:14:00] <Cork> snesaha: so call the functions from the fail function
[03:14:09] <Cork> i really don't see the problem
[03:14:31] <snesaha> so calling from the fail function will call for all ranges other than 2xx..
[03:14:41] <snesaha> but i want more depth in the ranges
[03:14:49] <Cork> ...
[03:14:57] <shebbi> Cork: What would you use to check if a sibling tag has a particular parent tag?
[03:15:02] <Cork> snesaha: are you trying to be funny??
[03:15:20] <Cork> .fail is called for all 4xx or 5xx status codes
[03:15:25] <Cork> you get the number as a string
[03:15:33] <Cork> just do the checking on that string
[03:15:39] <Cork> and do what ever you want
[03:16:08] <Cork> shebbi: if it is a sibling, you can just check the parent
[03:16:22] <Cork> so $(this).closest('selector').length > 0
[03:16:38] <shebbi> Cork: im not sure if the parent exists
[03:16:58] <Cork> shebbi: the selector would tell you
[03:17:34] <shebbi> Cork: $(this).parents('selector') ?
[03:17:38] <Cork> no
[03:17:39] <Cork> closest
[03:17:55] <Cork> shebbi: .parents gives you an array of all the parents of the element
[03:18:00] <Cork> you very rarely want this
[03:18:49] <shebbi> Cork: you could do but not efficient right?
[03:19:18] <Cork> shebbi: .parents can give you grand parents
[03:19:31] <Cork> and that will give unexpectedly wide searches
[03:19:42] <Cork> .closest finds the closest parent
[03:19:48] <Cork> and is basically always what you want
[03:20:11] <Cork> (to the extent where dom4 implements .closest but not .partents)
[03:20:43] <shebbi> cork: if ( $(this).closest('selector') ) { // will this work too? or must use length }
[03:20:52] <Cork> you need length
[03:21:02] <Cork> jquery always returns a jquery object
[03:21:08] <Cork> and {} == true
[03:21:14] <shebbi> ok
[03:22:12] <shebbi> cork: if ( $(this).closest('selector').is(:'visible') { how about now ?}
[03:22:19] <Cork> uh
[03:22:36] <Cork> that doesn't even do the same thing
[03:22:41] <Cork> or parse for that matter
[03:23:00] <Cork> (the colon is outside the string)
[03:23:11] <shebbi> cork: if ( $(this).closest('selector').is(':visible') { how about now ?}
[03:23:17] <Cork> that doesn't even do the same thing <--
[03:23:52] <Cork> $(this).closest('selector').is(':visible') checks if the element(s) matching the selector is != display:none or visibility: hidden
[03:24:00] <Cork> (or height: 0 or width: 0)
[03:24:11] <Cork> it doesn't only check if the element exist in the dom
[03:24:28] <shebbi> Cork: Closest can get grandparents too depending on the selector
[03:24:36] <Cork> and if all you want to know is if the parent exist, you do a heck of a lot of uneeded work there
[03:24:42] <Cork> shebbi: no
[03:25:05] <Cork> shebbi: by grand parents i mean <div><section><article><div><a>
[03:25:20] <Cork> $('a').parents('div').find() will basically search the entire page
[03:25:37] <Cork> $('a').closest('div').find() will only search the a tag
[03:26:30] <shebbi> Cork: closest means next closest or immediately closest?
[03:26:51] <Cork> shebbi: .closest starts at the current element and walks upwards
[03:27:55] <shebbi> Cork: it can bubble all the way up like parents depending on the selector used
[03:27:56] <Cork> shebbi: the reason parents('div').find will search the entire page is cause it will run .find on both divs in the parent tree
[03:28:01] <Cork> and the top one wraps everything
[03:28:12] <Cork> shebbi: yes, but it always only returns one
[03:28:22] <Cork> that is the big difference between it and .parentes
[03:28:24] <Cork> *parents
[03:28:39] <Cork> if you take this again <div><section><article><div><a>
[03:28:46] <shebbi> Cork: hence the plural of parents, gotya
[03:28:52] <Cork> $('a').parents('div') will give you ['div', 'div']
[03:29:00] <Cork> where the last div is the top parent
[03:29:08] <Cork> $('a').closest('div') will give you ['div']
[03:29:12] <Cork> where div is the closest div parent
[03:29:28] <Cork> shebbi: and why it is basically never what you want
[03:29:49] <Cork> the one situation i know of is for menus
[03:30:02] <Cork> $(this).parents('ul').addClass('expanded')
[03:31:13] <shebbi> yes
[03:32:26] <drager> Hey, I want to implement "long polling", basically I want when a user posts a message all the clients "online" get that newly posted message without the need to refresh the page… I have some trouble though. JS and PHP-code here; https://gist.github.com/drager/a85fadf391ed18d69bbb
[03:33:13] <drager> So it's the getMessages and sendMessage functions
[03:36:02] <shebbi> Cork: you know a quick way of finding if a jquery object is present in DOM?
[03:36:53] <shebbi> Cork: i have a jquery object that I want to see if another matching one exists in DOM. Obviously closest or parents wont work as they use selector
[03:37:59] <mooncup> shebbi: if ($(selector).length)
[03:39:52] <shebbi> oh boy
[03:40:56] * CssNoob good evening y'all
[03:46:02] <drager> So problem is that all the connected clients do not get the new data; https://gist.github.com/drager/657199f6d9443d42656e
[03:46:14] <drager> and the one sending a message get duplicates…
[04:06:02] <shebbi> Cork you there? or out on lunch?
[04:06:11] <Cork> i'm here
[04:06:29] <Cork> but just ask the question, you don't need to address it unless it is an answer to a question
[04:06:49] <Cork> (someone will answer if they know the answer)
[04:10:10] <Oka> I missed the question.
[04:10:56] <Cork> there wasn't one :)
[04:11:08] <Oka> Interesting.
[04:19:37] <Juslintek> Hi, how to make sortable available on child element after all the sortable div is htmled
[04:20:28] <Juslintek> Because when I return newly generated html back to view sortable isn't working on it anymore
[04:20:57] <Cork> Juslintek: as long as you don't replace the "host" element it should work just fine
[04:21:18] <Juslintek> well I replace that
[04:21:35] <Juslintek> Hm, but how to make it activatable from parent.
[04:21:48] <Cork> then you don't have a sortable element at all anymore
[04:22:04] <Juslintek> Cork, but how to reactive it?
[04:22:10] <Cork> its a clean element
[04:22:16] <Cork> just make it sortable again
[04:22:24] <shebbi> what is the correct construct to use to "exit" from a function in jquery?
[04:22:29] <Cork> if you replace the element you have no connection left to the old element
[04:22:41] <Juslintek> Cork, I know.
[04:22:52] <Cork> shebbi: same as for normal js
[04:22:57] <Cork> return
[04:23:04] <Juslintek> Just wondering if there is easy way to reactive it without duplicating same code on success
[04:23:12] <Cork> Juslintek: nope
[04:23:20] <shebbi> Cork: and it works the same?
[04:23:26] <Cork> as jquery has lost all the data it used it can't help you
[04:23:39] <Cork> (the data was connected on the element that doesn't exist anymore)
[04:23:51] <Cork> shebbi: jquery is javascript
[04:23:52] <shebbi> Cork: i'm using a .filter( function(){ return "stuff"; } );;
[04:23:55] <Cork> it isn't a separate language
[04:24:10] <Cork> it just provides a framework to make it easier to write
[04:24:48] <shebbi> Cork: it returns for each match. i want to exit after one correct match
[04:25:06] <Cork> shebbi: you can't do that
[04:25:13] <Cork> not with filter at least
[04:25:29] <shebbi> hmm
[04:25:51] <slavka`> hey guys, does anyone know to an extension or plugin that extends functionality of arrays to be able to deal with alphanumeric indexes... with the default functionality the .length only gives the length of numeric indexes... and obviously other methods/functions dont work as required..
[04:25:54] <Cork> as the return value for .filter is if the element should be included or not
[04:26:07] <Cork> so there isn't anything you can return to abort the loop
[04:26:36] <Cork> slavka`: arrays doesn't have indexes in that form
[04:26:42] <Cork> it is a list of values
[04:26:54] <Cork> if you want to have keys use an object
[04:27:02] <slavka`> ok thanks
[04:27:31] <Cork> slavka`: sadly php is messing this up, but it should be clear if you know any other language
[04:27:48] <Cork> object is what other languages see as map or hash
[04:28:07] <shebbi> when you do this:
[04:28:20] <Cork> slavka`: just to be clear, for the same reason an array always starts at 0
[04:28:23] <TheHackops> Hey guys I'm trying to make a simple light box for a bit of fun, I wish to clone an object into the lightbox using clone() (I think thats correct) http://pastebin.com/sKVDtJcn
[04:29:23] <TheHackops> How ever when i click the image it only expands inside the gallery and does not "go into" the light box
[04:29:39] <shebbi> $('parents_selector').find('sibling').html() === 'foo') { how do i then delete that matching parent }
[04:30:08] <Cork> shebbi: closest('selector').remove()
[04:30:33] <Cork> shebbi: alternatively you can do the find inside the filter
[04:30:43] <Cork> so you don't change the scope of the jquery object
[04:32:40] <shebbi> $('div.contacts').find('a').html() === 'foo') { how do i then delete that matching <div class="contacts"> }
[04:32:54] <Cork> see the answer above
[04:35:15] <shebbi> $('div.contacts').find('a').html() === 'foo') { .closest('div.contacts').remove(); }
[04:35:20] <shebbi> no go
[04:35:41] <shebbi> if ( $('div.contacts').find('a').html() === 'foo') { .closest('div.contacts').remove(); }
[04:38:10] <paulvd> hello, anyone knows of a free slider plugin which has vertical thumbnail navigation?
[04:38:22] <shebbi> cork? can't seem to put it all together right
[04:40:00] <shebbi> if ( $('div.contacts').find('a').html() === 'foo') { $(this).remove(); }
[04:40:09] <mchelen> is there any equivalent to sprintf() that is in jquery core?
[04:42:31] <Cork> shebbi: if doesn't loop around the matches you can't use it like that
[04:42:36] <Cork> you need to use filter
[04:42:39] <Cork> mchelen: no
[04:43:52] <paulvd> has anyone here tried vertical thumbnails with flexslider?
[04:44:06] <mchelen> Cork: oh well, thanks anyway
[04:44:25] <Cork> mchelen: have a look at the different template engines
[04:45:50] <shebbi> Cork: within $('div.contacts').filter( function() { if ( $('div.contacts').find('a').html === 'username' ) { $(this).remove(); } );
[04:45:57] <Cork> O_o'
[04:46:39] <Cork> $('div.contacts').filter(function() { return $(this).find('a').html() === 'username'; }).remove();
[04:46:41] <shebbi> firstly i don't like the multiple use of div.contacts and it doesn't like $(this)
[04:47:03] <shebbi> oh
[04:47:14] <Cork> the entire code was invalid so ya
[04:47:20] <shebbi> it returns the object so you can delete it. perfect
[04:47:36] <Cork> no it filters out an generates a new object
[04:48:17] <Cork> also note that .html is a function not a property
[04:48:33] <shebbi> meaning?
[04:48:58] <Cork> if a function is the same as 'username'
[04:49:05] <Cork> not the return value of a cuntion
[04:49:13] <Cork> *function
[04:49:37] <saucey> hey guys
[04:49:52] <mchelen> Cork: ok thanks, ill check that out
[04:51:05] <saucey> i got this code http://laravel.io/bin/xK0JB i want to add options to dynamic or place those files in static and then rename static to dynamic but it keep throwing an error
[04:51:42] <shebbi> Cork: the $(this) in filter won't be confused with another $(this) in event handler?
[04:52:06] <Cork> shebbi: ok, you need to sit down and read a get started tutorial
[04:52:21] <Cork> your asking too many basic javascript questions
[04:52:36] <saucey> who?
[04:52:40] <Cork> shebbi:
[04:52:43] <saucey> ok
[04:52:44] <shebbi> Cork: i'm guessing it doesn't get confused
[04:53:13] <saucey> Cork: can you take a quick look into this http://laravel.io/bin/xK0JB
[04:53:22] <Cork> saucey: looking
[04:53:30] <saucey> cheers mate
[04:53:42] <shebbi> Cork: that code goes inside a .click function
[04:53:54] <shebbi> Cork: which will have $(this) as well
[04:54:00] <Cork> saucey: all you have there is som json
[04:54:13] <saucey> when i run this in grunt it calls static and dynamic, i just need it to do dynamic but with the options
[04:54:16] <Cork> where is the code that actually do the or actions?
[04:54:56] <Cork> saucey: ah, then you would have to ask in a grunt support channel
[04:55:06] <Cork> that is just json and not something i can help you much with
[04:55:53] <Cork> ?g learn.jquery.com
[04:55:55] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/
[04:56:04] <Cork> shebbi: ^ read that and learn the basics
[04:56:40] <shebbi> Cork: I'll promise to read that but need a quick answer to finish this code off.
[04:57:03] <Cork> shebbi: i don't have the time to be your private coder
[04:57:15] <Cork> i'm here to give tips on how to solve things, not do it for you
[04:57:33] <Cork> and you don't know enough of the basics to have any use of the info i give you
[04:57:44] <shebbi> Cork: just asking if $(this) will clash. no coding required.
[04:59:41] * shebbi away reading learn.jquery.com as suspects now it will be faster :D
[05:00:15] <sweet2k4> is there a function in jquery to bring up a popup simlar to the alert fuction in js. i would like to be able to style it. or do i need to use popupmodal plugin?
[05:03:11] <shebbi> sweet2k4: why not use alert function then?
[05:03:40] <sweet2k4> i can style that one?
[05:04:00] <sweet2k4> with css?
[05:05:10] <sweet2k4> shebbi: ^
[05:06:08] <shebbi> sweet2k4: you probably want to use jquery ui dialog.
[05:07:17] <sweet2k4> shebbi: yeah i tried that one but i had problem with the positioning
[05:07:45] <sweet2k4> but i guess i just have to figure it out
[05:08:00] <shebbi> sweet2k4: correct. go try again.
[05:26:45] <Cork> sweet2k4: there are plenty of simpler widgets for showing alerts
[05:26:59] <Cork> you could make it with a simple div and some buttons too if you want
[05:29:00] <tocka> hi guys
[05:29:07] <tocka> I have this "issue" http://jsfiddle.net/pkb2jkwg/
[05:29:22] <tocka> im calculating the spaces between the elemnts
[05:29:27] <tocka> and then adding margins
[05:29:34] <tocka> but there is always a little bit left off at the end
[05:29:41] <tocka> + on safari there is a lot more
[05:29:46] <tocka> is there a way I could fix this?
[05:29:47] <tocka> :/
[05:36:54] <printForever> need some jQuery wisdom
[05:37:03] <printForever> how to close a HTML tag (div tag)
[05:37:22] <printForever> if you append single open or closed <div> tag, browser ignores it
[05:37:50] <printForever> I need to interupt the code workflow to inject code in between and then continue the structure
[05:40:20] <Erwat> printForever: have you read this and would information given here not work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16722216/how-to-fix-automatically-closing-div-tag-in-this-case ?
[05:41:05] <printForever> I'm trygin to "separate" the DOM once its created in the browser, inject my code, and continue DOM node
[05:42:20] <printForever> Erwat, this is not what I'm looking for
[05:43:04] <Erwat> i dont understand the question so i don't know, just wait until Cork comes back
[05:43:24] <Cork> printForever: browsers don't use html for the dom
[05:43:32] <printForever> hi Cork
[05:43:33] <Cork> the dom is a tree structure of dom elements
[05:43:39] <Cork> so you don't have closing tags
[05:43:44] <printForever> right on
[05:43:47] <Cork> you have elemetns and parent elements
[05:43:56] <printForever> of course, you're correct
[05:43:59] <Cork> and that is why you can't append closing tags separately
[05:44:13] <printForever> is there a way to achieve that?
[05:44:24] <Cork> build the html as a string and append it separately
[05:44:27] <Cork> or build it as dom elements
[05:44:32] <Cork> select the parent you want to add to
[05:44:41] <Cork> and add the elements directly there
[05:45:02] <printForever> I cant, because the content is then dynamically generated
[05:45:10] <Cork> var parent = $('<div>'); parent.append('<span>') parent.children().first().append('<b>')
[05:45:11] <printForever> so any change would break the workflow
[05:45:24] <Cork> then you would have to build the html separately
[05:45:26] <Cork> as a string
[05:45:32] <Cork> and then concat it and append it all in one go
[05:46:05] <printForever> I get what you're saying but its not applicable on my code... shucks
[05:46:32] <Cork> printForever: well the limitations of the two formats only leave you those options
[05:46:41] <Cork> either you use the dom and don't have tags
[05:46:46] <Cork> or you build html == string
[05:47:01] <Cork> there is a third option, but i don't recommend it
[05:47:08] <Cork> you could build a dom structure
[05:47:11] <Cork> and then serialize it
[05:47:17] <Cork> concat that with other html
[05:47:24] <Cork> and then use that later
[05:47:34] <printForever> right, I get it
[05:47:46] <Cork> printForever: what i would recommend is to look into a template engine
[05:47:47] <printForever> well, thanks for clarifying the subject
[05:48:01] <Cork> it would most likely make what you want to do much easier
[05:48:14] <printForever> I'm doing A/B testing and I need to break the HTML structure because of the wrapper
[05:48:16] <Cork> jqote2 is a favorite of mine
[05:48:19] <printForever> wrapper is set to 1000px
[05:48:37] <Cork> breake html structure??
[05:48:41] <printForever> I want to break the wrapper, insert html code (with styles), close the wrapper
[05:48:52] <Cork> so just parse the html
[05:48:52] <printForever> well... inject the code
[05:48:56] <printForever> I have
[05:48:58] <Cork> and select out the element you want
[05:49:03] <Cork> and just append the dom elements
[05:49:03] <printForever> but some of the code cant be parsed
[05:49:10] <printForever> I know
[05:49:16] <printForever> but it doesent work like that :)
[05:49:17] <Cork> so the source html you have is broken?
[05:49:21] <printForever> nah
[05:49:25] <printForever> I could do what you said
[05:49:30] <Cork> then i don't follow why you need to do this
[05:49:31] <printForever> but once user clicks anywhere
[05:49:34] <printForever> or selects a dropdown
[05:49:40] <printForever> everything will break apart
[05:49:42] <printForever> or will stay static
[05:49:47] <Cork> could you make a fiddle showing why you need to do this as html instead for as dom elements?
[05:50:14] <printForever> I was going to, but its a touchy subject so I cant
[05:50:26] <Cork> printForever: it doesn't need to be real data
[05:50:29] <Cork> just the flow
[05:50:29] <printForever> anyway, I thoght as much - what you described
[05:50:46] <printForever> I have an idea
[05:50:51] <Cork> i've handled quite a bit of third party html my self
[05:51:10] <Cork> and just parsing the original code to dom and then handling the dom structure basically always work
[05:51:32] <printForever> I'm going to remove the parrent ID
[05:51:43] <printForever> and wrap elements separately
[05:51:43] <Cork> ok?
[05:51:53] <printForever> its dirty
[05:51:56] <printForever> but it will work
[05:52:03] <printForever> I hope
[05:52:05] <printForever> :D
[05:52:06] <Cork> just use the .wrap on the elements in the fragment
[05:52:12] <printForever> yes
[05:52:14] <printForever> thats the plan
[05:52:15] <Cork> anyway as you don't want to explain it
[05:52:16] <printForever> :)
[05:52:28] <printForever> I would, but I'm on the clock
[05:52:31] * Cork goes back to work
[05:52:32] <printForever> and need to get this finished
[05:52:33] <printForever> ...
[05:52:41] <printForever> Cork, thanks a million dude
[05:52:46] <printForever> where do you live?
[05:52:53] <printForever> so I can buy you a beer
[06:39:37] <tocka> hi guys, could someone please help me calculate the position of 4 elements (excluding first and last)? http://jsfiddle.net/c3jtf54u/
[06:39:49] <tocka> Im trying to figure out a formula or something.. but its not going well :|
[06:39:54] <tocka> the bubble width is 54px :o
[06:42:15] <BillCriswell> tocka: Are you trying to get or set the position?
[06:42:25] <tocka> im trying to set the position
[06:42:36] <tocka> for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th bubble
[06:42:50] <tocka> 1st and last one is aligned to be position left and right
[06:42:52] <tocka> :|
[06:43:50] <BillCriswell> tocka: What's your goal here?
[06:44:09] <tocka> so that when the window is resized or loaded
[06:44:15] <tocka> all of the bubbles would be nicle aligned
[06:44:56] <BillCriswell> Aligned center?
[06:46:14] <tocka> they would have exact same spacing
[06:46:19] <tocka> if you get what I mean..
[07:03:51] <BillCriswell> tocka: Sorry had a meeting.
[07:04:25] <tocka> its ok:)
[07:04:28] <tocka> im almost done!
[07:11:08] <BillCriswell> tocka: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6865194/fluid-width-with-equally-spaced-divs this looks very promising.
[07:11:35] <BillCriswell> and no JS, so it's already like a million times better.
[07:12:18] <tocka> hmmmm
[07:12:20] <tocka> lets try it
[07:13:28] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I need a bit of help with selectors. I'm tryign to select a class that's in an iFrame on my page.
[07:13:48] <ashgotti> I tried .iframeClass .spanClass but that doesn't seem to work. I dont' get any errors
[07:14:18] <Xatenev> ashgotti: That doesnt work
[07:14:33] <Xatenev> "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy"
[07:14:53] <Xatenev> It has to be an iframe of the same domain
[07:14:59] <techkudu> you can select the iframe but nothing within it
[07:15:07] <Xatenev> U can if it is from the same domain
[07:15:12] <BillCriswell> If the iframe is loading content on the same domain I think you need to use .contents()
[07:15:12] <techkudu> err yeah
[07:15:16] <Xatenev> with $('#iframe').contents().find('urelements')
[07:15:24] <BillCriswell> Ha, I was right.
[07:15:26] <Xatenev> yap :P
[07:15:32] <Xatenev> but **only** if it is on the same domain
[07:15:33] <Xatenev> as ur page
[07:17:19] <ashgotti> Thanks! It is the same domain.
[07:25:37] <drager> I'm trying to implement "long polling" but my server "hangs"; https://gist.github.com/drager/65b6380264580362b2cd
[07:27:15] <ashgotti> RE: Selector in an iframe. I can't get it to work with .cotents().find()
[07:27:16] <Pinchiukas> I have this array: "nagios_urls = new Array(); nagios_urls['prod']='someurl';" and I'm trying to iterate like so: "$.each(nagios_urls, function(i){console.log(i)} );" and it prints me nothing! Why is that?
[07:28:09] <ashgotti> This is what I have: $('.flc-iframe').contents().find('.flc-prefsEditor-layout-controls').hide();
[07:28:20] <bewilled> Why when I type: $('.hoverPlacer').mouseover();    On Google Chrome Console I get: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[07:34:39] <bewilled> alert('hello world') works, but $('.hoverPlacer').mouseover(); doesn't. It must be that google console does not recognize jquery? The library is loaded and interacts with the page
[07:35:00] <tocka> BillCriswell thanks a million <3
[07:35:55] <techkudu> bewilled: try to isolate and duplicate the problem on jsfiddle.net
[07:36:31] <bewilled> I just want to see if google chrome's console can execute jquery code
[07:37:01] <bewilled> like type something, like trigger an event, and see it happen on the screen
[07:38:10] <techkudu> try $( document ).ready(function() { console.log( "ready!" ); });
[07:39:43] <BillCriswell> tocka: No problem at all.
[07:40:23] <BillCriswell> bewilled: $('a').eq(0).trigger('click')
[07:40:31] <BillCriswell> Will click the first link on the page.
[07:42:59] <ashgotti> If I alert the $('iframe').contents(), I get 'object Object'. hmmm
[07:43:34] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: console.log() it instead.
[07:43:42] <BillCriswell> Always console.log it.
[07:44:10] <ashgotti> *facepalm* duh
[07:44:21] <bewilled> BillCriswell, thanks for your answer but I still get a Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function. Do I have a library conflict?
[07:46:47] <BillCriswell> bewilled:  Replace $ with jQuery when in doubt.
[07:46:55] <ashgotti> I think part of the problem with accessing the contents of my iframe is that it's set to display:none and there is toggle for showing and hiding it
[07:46:59] <BillCriswell> So: jQuery('a').eq(0).trigger('click')
[07:47:01] <ashgotti> when the dom loads, it's hiddent
[07:47:03] <ashgotti> *hidden
[07:47:17] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: They wouldn't prevent access to the DOM.
[07:47:28] <BillCriswell> As far as I understand.
[07:47:43] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: I can't figure out why it's not working then. I did check the source and all the elements are tthere so you're probably right
[07:48:01] <ashgotti> When I console log a class within the iframe, I get "[]"
[07:48:52] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Try something like div
[07:50:49] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: $('iframe').contents().find('.div')
[07:51:18] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: if I do find('body'), I just get '<body></body>'
[07:52:56] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/contents/ and look for "iframe" in there.
[07:55:32] <ashgotti> Thanks. I have a feeling it's because the iframe isn't loaded when I'm firing off my console log
[07:55:41] <ashgotti> in inspector, I can console log the contents without a problem
[07:57:18] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Should be able to do something like var $iframe = $('#iframe'); $iframe.on('load', function () { $iframe.contents().find('.stuff'); });
[07:57:25] <BillCriswell> Kind of a stab in the dark... but feels right?
[07:58:26] <ashgotti> Yup, I'm working on something similar
[07:58:30] <ashgotti> thanks for all the help this mornign!
[07:58:38] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:58:57] <Xatenev> ashgotti: on document ready
[07:59:19] <Xatenev> $(document).ready() { }
[07:59:35] <Xatenev> to make sure ur iframe is definetly loaded when ur trying to access it via jquery
[08:00:09] <ashgotti> Xatenev: I have a $(document).ready for my main code and am now making sure hte iframe is loaded before I fire off iframe specific code
[08:00:39] <Xatenev> When u got a $(document) ready around ur JS and u get the iframe just by HTML
[08:00:42] <Xatenev> then its ok
[08:01:02] <Xatenev> ashgotti: It is on the same domain right?
[08:01:17] <ashgotti> Yup, same domain
[08:01:18] <Xatenev> like for example www.example.com has an iframe with content of www.example.com/iframe
[08:01:30] <Xatenev> Okay
[08:01:35] <Xatenev> Then u would have to make a fiddle
[08:01:38] <Xatenev> to get more help :P
[08:02:23] <ashgotti> Thanks for the help. Don't know about a fiddle, it's a drupal based project on a VM.
[08:02:36] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:02:39] <bewilled> BillCriswell, thanks for your help,  jQuery('.name').eq(0).trigger('click') actually prints the object(In the chrome console) but no redirect occurs
[08:02:43] <Xatenev> Copy ur JS to there, and show us
[08:02:45] <Xatenev> so we can give more help
[08:03:12] <ashgotti> That I can do
[08:03:56] <ciqsteve> Q: I have an element that I fadeIn, and then fadeOut using the fadeIn callback.
[08:04:06] <ashgotti> http://jsfiddle.net/5aLLrhx2/ Here we go. It's not logging that hte iframe is loaded but I get no errors
[08:04:48] <ciqsteve> I'd like to 'pause' in between the fadeIn fadeOut.  It looks like delay() is what I want to use, but I'm not sure how to shoehorn it in..?
[08:04:55] <Xatenev> ashgotti: jQuer yis not defined
[08:05:09] <Xatenev> U can select jquery as library
[08:05:12] <Xatenev> on the top left ;
[08:05:36] <ashgotti> oops http://jsfiddle.net/5aLLrhx2/1/
[08:05:45] <ciqsteve> google is my friend
[08:05:51] <ciqsteve> solved
[08:06:28] <Xatenev> That makes no sense
[08:06:29] <Xatenev> ashgotti
[08:06:35] <Xatenev> when the document is ready (means the iframe is rdy)
[08:06:44] <Xatenev> then ur checking if the iframe is ready and print "iframe loaded"
[08:06:47] <Xatenev> makes absolutely no sense
[08:07:15] <ashgotti> Xatenev: i didn't have the second check for making sure my iframe is ready and it didn't work. I thought it's because the iframe wasn't loaded yet
[08:07:22] <krambiorix> hi, how can i check if a string is a decimal or not .... eg. 5,1 -> IS decimal    5 -> is NOT decimal
[08:07:44] <Xatenev> Well doesnt seem to work here
[08:07:47] <Xatenev> Error: Permission denied to access property 'document'
[08:07:49] <ashgotti> nope doesnt
[08:08:16] <ashgotti> I was just going based on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30005/how-do-i-fire-an-event-when-a-iframe-has-finished-loading-in-jquery
[08:09:42] <Xatenev> well its permission denied
[08:09:54] <Xatenev> Just dont use iframes :P
[08:09:57] <Xatenev> then u dont got this trouble
[08:10:08] <techkudu> ^^
[08:10:21] <Xatenev> Cause its hard to reproduce the problem on jsfiddle cause cross domain stuff
[08:10:59] <ashgotti> I wish!
[08:11:13] <ashgotti> The project is actually integrating fluidproject.org framework, that adds accessibility options to the top of hte page
[08:11:20] <ashgotti> The options are housed in an iframe
[08:23:41] <bewilled> BillCriswell, jQuery('a')[0].click(); worked!
[08:25:09] <BillCriswell> bewilled: Not totally sure what the differences would be.
[08:31:01] <bewilled> BillCriswell, I also don't know.. jQuery('a').eq(0).trigger('click') just prints the object. jQuery('a')[0].click() works Query('a')[0].trigger('click') does not
[08:31:41] <BillCriswell> bewilled: Yeah I dunno. Weird.
[08:33:15] <techkudu> maybe try noconflick http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[08:33:31] <techkudu> t*
[08:36:43] <sacho> "prints the object"?
[08:39:00] <bewilled> sacho, prints the html node on the console
[08:39:34] <bewilled> ie: <a href="#">mylink</a>
[08:50:50] <jKlaus> Anyone here use jQuery DataTables and come across an issue of the copy button not working until after having clicked the export button?
[08:51:11] <jKlaus> Seems like it may be a z-index issue but I can't get it sorted
[08:53:13] <drager> I'm trying to implement "long polling" but my server "hangs"; https://gist.github.com/drager/65b6380264580362b2cd
[08:58:32] <BillCriswell> drager: Is the server 500ing?
[09:00:31] <drager> BillCriswell: Nope, just (pending)
[09:00:37] <drager> In chrome network tab
[09:02:14] <BillCriswell> Are any of the requests going through or it fails immediately?
[09:03:16] <drager> BillCriswell: First request is fine but when I update it our tries to use another browser after that first request it fails.
[09:03:19] <drager> Just "Loads"
[09:06:20] <BillCriswell> drager: It seems server related to me. Also, check to see what timestamp actually is on the server. I don't think it's a number.
[09:08:04] <BillCriswell> drager: I feel like it's soemthing with that getMessages loop.
[09:08:31] <drager> BillCriswell: Yeah, I figure. I'm not sure how to fix it and still "push" data
[09:12:26] <BillCriswell> drager: I never did this before, but wouldn't the get just need you to return messages since timestamp?
[09:13:47] <BillCriswell> $.get('messages.php', { timestamp: '2014-11-19 12:12:03' }, function (newMessages) { $messages.append(newMessages); }); then on the server just grab messages created after timestamp?
[09:14:55] <BillCriswell> Er, $.get('messages.php', { timestamp: '...' }).done(function () { ... }); *
[09:15:33] <drager> BillCriswell: That's basically what I do
[09:15:41] <drager> but my timestamp is a UNIX timestamp
[09:25:59] <BillCriswell> drager: Sorry. Why the while loop?
[09:31:51] <bewilled> When doesn't the event mouseover which is bound to the .thumbMove class get triggered when clicking the #page-title Object in this example? http://pastebin.com/zZB9Dr1D
[09:33:04] <drager> BillCriswell: Too keep the connection open...
[09:36:15] <BillCriswell> I guess I never knew the difference between long and short polling lol
[09:38:26] <BillCriswell> hugs node.
[09:39:15] <drager> Yeah
[09:39:18] <drager> Node is nice
[09:39:22] <drager> Cant use it though
[09:39:25] <drager> (for this task)
[09:41:05] <BillCriswell> drager: When you just use the plain code from https://github.com/panique/php-long-polling/ does it work well on your server?
[09:41:25] <drager> BillCriswell: Have not tried that, let me do that thanks
[09:41:27] <ciqsteve> Q:  I have a function that runs when a user clicks a button.  This function changes the display on an image from None to Block
[09:41:40] <ciqsteve> and then records the height and width of the image
[09:42:12] <ciqsteve> Can I 100% depend on that image being there, or does the browser do it's own caching of image loads that can get in the way?
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> the caching shouldn't "get in the way".
[09:42:55] <ciqsteve> by comparison, I know if I load the image myself dynamically, I have to use .onLoad to call the measure function
[09:43:47] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve do you mean that you want to make sure the image is there before recording the dimentions?
[09:44:17] <ciqsteve> yes.. when the page loads original the img has a src in place
[09:44:24] <ciqsteve> originally
[09:47:56] <Bnaya> Why dose naturalHeight is accesed via prop and not attr?
[09:48:46] <robertmaxrees> .attr() accesses markup.  .prop() accesses the actual object.
[09:48:51] <robertmaxrees> normally you want .prop() and not .attr() anyway
[09:55:32] <drager> BillCriswell: That works fine
[09:56:46] <Utils> How would you go about appending the same element multiple times? This is what I've got: http://jsfiddle.net/7wewpu6k/ I would assume I'd need to clone the "html" var but not sure how to go about it.
[09:56:54] <grabbby> Can anyone tell me why this Google Chart isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/s2wtyuaf/1/
[09:58:08] <robertmaxrees> Utils http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7wewpu6k/1/
[09:58:28] <Utils> Oh .clone :D
[09:58:29] <Utils> Thanks.
[10:11:32] <rubyonrailed> does anyone know a good carousel plugin that looks like this??  http://imgur.com/xsw5Zc2  There ins't going to be any images, just text.
[10:12:40] <robertmaxrees> any carousel that you then style to look the way you want it to.
[10:12:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:13:07] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed any particular reason you want a carousel?
[10:13:43] <rubyonrailed> What are some other options that allows users to scroll through different letters?
[10:17:52] <robertmaxrees> i saw that because of this: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[10:19:15] <robertmaxrees> *say that.  can't type today
[10:19:48] <rubyonrailed> hmm
[10:19:57] <rubyonrailed> I don't think this applies to what i'm using it for
[10:20:47] <cjohnson> displaying information to a user?
[10:52:49] <Juslintek> I think it quite basic question, but here it goes: How to load html on ajax successful return. I want not to refresh the page, but to load html with updated data.
[10:53:13] <Juslintek> It contains all document.
[10:55:40] <jimi_> Can someone tell me why this button is not being disabled? http://pastie.org/private/ju8wgtm7skc6ol9e7szq
[10:58:37] <NorthBlast> is it possible to fake a menu drop down as selection drop down ?
[10:58:59] <cjohnson> Juslintek: $.load will let you load an ajax response right into a node's html
[10:59:23] * CssNoob good morning and goodnight y'all
[10:59:24] <jimi_> i even tried .attr('disabled',true) and .prop... neither work
[10:59:44] <Juslintek> cjohnson, what if my node is same tab? ;-)
[10:59:58] <cjohnson> Juslintek: ?
[11:00:13] <cjohnson> jimi_: what is the element you are binding that to?
[11:00:22] <jimi_> cjohnson, a button element
[11:00:24] <Juslintek> cjohnson, by same tab I mean same Browser tab.
[11:00:35] <Juslintek> not some div.
[11:00:46] <cjohnson> Juslintek: as opposed to what?
[11:00:54] <cjohnson> JS tends to only run in the scope of one page/tab at a time
[11:01:08] <cjohnson> so yes, this would be for loading an ajax response into a node on the same page that it fired from
[11:01:16] <Juslintek> cjohnson, so you mean load will to flickerless reload?
[11:01:20] <Juslintek> do*
[11:01:21] <cjohnson> flickerless?
[11:01:28] <cjohnson> it won't cause a page refresh if that's what you mean
[11:01:34] <cjohnson> the rest of the page remains untouched
[11:02:03] <Juslintek> cjohnson, the content is whole page, I want to reload whole page, but without a flicker.
[11:02:31] <Juslintek> I don't want to put all html in some fixed div or something.
[11:02:33] <cjohnson> jimi_: there is no second argument to that event handler
[11:02:38] <cjohnson> jimi_: the element is this, not elem
[11:02:47] <Juslintek> or absolute div.
[11:02:54] <cjohnson> Juslintek: you'll have to change your backend to only return the portion of the page you want to refresh
[11:03:18] <jimi_> cjohnson, ah, i thought it was event and element
[11:03:34] <Juslintek> cjohnson, my question was, is it possible to load all page, not the portion of the page. ;-)
[11:03:37] <cjohnson> nope, just event, and then any arguments you pass via .trigger (which in the case of a natural click, there are none)
[11:03:50] <cjohnson> Juslintek: then I have no idea what you're asking. you want to reload the entire page without reloading the entire page?
[11:04:06] <Juslintek> cjohnson, now you see where I'm going :-D
[11:04:10] <jimi_> cjohnson, here is a fiddle of it w/ 1 argument, and still not disabling button http://jsfiddle.net/znxzavy0/1/
[11:05:02] <Juslintek> cjohnson, ah just forget I realised the absurdity of my thought.
[11:07:16] <prst331> $(".edit").on("click",function(){}); if I now replaceWith() the content of a div with a link of the class ".edit", the function doesn't fire, even though i'm listing for the event witth "on" ... what am doing wrong?
[11:07:30] <prst331> *when i click the link
[11:07:38] <robertmaxrees> prst331 because you're removing the element.
[11:07:40] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[11:08:04] <robertmaxrees> bind to an ancestor that exists on pageload instead - $(parent).on('click', '.edit', function() {});
[11:09:05] <prst331> hm i have the <div  id=test></div> if i $("test").replaceWith("<a href=... class=editable>...</a>"), the <a>-element isn't added to the dom?
[11:09:24] <robertmaxrees> prst331 sure it is - the issue is that you're breaking the reference.
[11:09:30] <robertmaxrees> .on() only binds to things that exist.
[11:09:37] <robertmaxrees> if you remove/replace those things, that reference breaks.
[11:09:40] <BillCriswell> You also probably want $('#test')
[11:09:50] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[11:09:57] <BillCriswell> I think that's the only issue there lol
[11:10:14] <robertmaxrees> their original problem looks like it was more.
[11:10:37] <BillCriswell> Oh I just saw the latest thingie.
[11:10:49] <prst331> if i $("body").append("<a href=... class=editable>link</a>") _after_ page load, the function fires?!
[11:10:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:11:07] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about how all this works.
[11:11:18] <BillCriswell> prst331: Did you change your nick from something else?
[11:12:02] <robertmaxrees> prst331 past up your code in a fiddle, because you're not making any sense at this point.
[11:12:22] <robertmaxrees> *paste
[11:31:48] <prst331> got it working. the only thing i had to do was move the code from the $(document).ready() function to the bottom of <body>
[11:31:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:32:04] <robertmaxrees> then you've got another issue.
[11:32:51] <prst331> yup. just gave a confusing description of the problem lol
[11:33:21] <robertmaxrees> that document ready code should run at effectively the same time.
[11:33:24] <robertmaxrees> so you have another problem.
[11:33:41] <prst331> no there must be a subtle difference
[11:33:47] <robertmaxrees> there really isn't.
[11:33:54] <prst331> im digging the jquery code
[11:33:58] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're munging up how event bindings work.
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> prst331 let's talk here - not on PM.
[11:43:08] <robertmaxrees> the issue is $("a").on("click", func); is trying to bind to all <a> tags that exist when the document ready fires.
[11:43:23] <robertmaxrees> you're getting hit with a race condition.
[11:44:50] <prst331> and how does that go together with = ready() == the same as having the code in the <body>? that point i don't get
[11:45:02] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time yo.
[11:45:26] <robertmaxrees> that's the race condition part and you're only going to make things more confusing and difficult for yourself.
[11:46:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aqrowjvu/ check this out.
[11:46:47] <robertmaxrees> see how it magically works?
[11:46:54] <robertmaxrees> that's becasue the a tag exists when you run the binding.
[11:47:23] <prst331> lol thats not what i want to do
[11:47:26] <robertmaxrees> before, you were trying to bind to an a tag that didn't exist until after the binding ran.
[11:47:59] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead and save yourself the headaches
[11:48:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:49:32] <prst331> if you bind to an element with on(), you can add it later... it doesn't have to exist when you create the binding. and it works if you add elements to the page with append().. so why does that work?
[11:49:49] <prst331> *add elements after pageload with append()
[11:50:15] <DavisV> Hey everybody, I'm trying to implement this character count code for my textarea. It works fine, but if there is text already in the text area, it does not update until I click within the text area field and either type or use space/backspace. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/h6xkow4s/
[11:50:21] <DavisV> Thank you for your help in advance
[11:50:34] <cjohnson> prst331: false, unless you bound with event delegation, nodes created after the binding that fit the selector are _not_ automatically bound
[11:51:06] <cjohnson> $('a').on('click', function() { ... });  does not bind to every a that will ever exist, only those that exist at the time this code snippet runs
[11:51:14] <prst331> lol but it works!!!
[11:51:20] <cjohnson> $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { ... }); will, however
[11:51:40] <cjohnson> no, it doesn't. you're misunderstanding what's going on if you think non-delegated event handlers are being bound to nodes created after the fact
[11:51:43] <cjohnson> paste your code please
[11:52:12] <prst331> so .on is the new live() ?
[11:52:24] <prst331> .live()
[11:52:30] <cjohnson> DavisV: try binding to keyup?
[11:52:39] <cjohnson> on combines live with bind, I believe
[11:52:43] <cjohnson> when you pass it a selector
[11:54:57] <cjohnson> DavisV: http://jsfiddle.net/h6xkow4s/2/ seems to work fine for me
[11:57:28] <DavisV> cjohnson: Sorry, please let me clarify. The code works fine, yes. I am basically adding and editing records in a database. For adding records, the code works fine. However, when I pull information while editing (i.e, there is text already in the product description field), the character count stays to 160 instead of the actual characters remaining.
[11:57:47] <DavisV> If that makes any sense.
[11:58:15] <cjohnson> ah. trigger an event on page load
[11:58:29] <cjohnson> $('someNode').on('change', function() { ... do stuff on change }).trigger('change');
[11:58:32] <cjohnson> is how I usually do it
[11:58:50] <cjohnson> that way you get a binding with a single initializing ire
[11:58:59] <prst331> good now everything works as it should, i have been enlightend... thanks guys.
[11:59:03] <DavisV> Okay, I'll give that a go!
[11:59:57] <jb> I'm using this to submit form data via AJAX:  http://pastie.org/9730776 .. is there a way that I can ONLY submit the 'confirm_password' form if it actually contains data?  I don't want to post confirm_password if the user chooses not to provide a new password.
[12:00:18] <cjohnson> check that the fields aren't empty
[12:00:23] <cjohnson> with an if check
[12:00:54] <DavisV> Right
[12:01:04] <jb> cjohnson: inline within 'var formData' ?
[12:01:29] <cjohnson> not really, on the next line
[12:01:34] <cjohnson> are all 3 fields required? just one? what?
[12:01:57] <cjohnson> if (formData.id.length > 0 && formData.confirm_password.length > 0) ...
[12:01:59] <jb> in this example, id and enabled should be required.. "confirm_password" should not.
[12:02:13] <cjohnson> ah then just check those fields explicitly
[12:02:27] <jb> hrm, and actually "checkbox" doesn't work on L6 either.
[12:02:34] <cjohnson> alternatively, you could try setting required="true" on the nodes. though that won't work in some older browsers
[12:02:45] <cjohnson> there is no such element as <checkbox> is there ?
[12:02:46] <cjohnson> ;)
[12:02:51] <jb> yeah, need to fix that :)
[12:03:10] <cjohnson> you may also want to inspect $(form).serialize()
[12:03:23] <cjohnson> if you have a proper form it will build your formData for you
[12:04:05] <jb> yeah, I was reading about that.
[12:05:03] <jb> cjohnson: so, something like "data: form.serialize()" ?
[12:05:08] <cjohnson> yep
[12:05:37] <cjohnson> I would investigate using HTML form validation as well, even if it doesn't work for all browsers: http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation
[12:05:58] <jb> yeah, I do have some validation in place.
[12:06:01] <cjohnson> cool
[12:06:43] <jikuja> Any ideas: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26995412/how-to-develop-non-traditional-jquery-plugin I'm at dead end with my first plugin:(
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:07:05] <robertmaxrees> prst331 did you get what you need?
[12:07:37] <prst331> robertmaxrees, yes. all fine now. thanks.
[12:07:39] <jb> cjohnson: another stupid question, but form.serialize() doesn't work.  "form is not defined" ..
[12:07:49] <jikuja> My friend warned me about ajax and of course I have now problems with ajax.
[12:07:54] <cjohnson> well, form needs to be a variable that refers to the <form> node
[12:08:08] <jb> it's name?
[12:08:09] <cjohnson> you can't refer to variables you haven't created yet of course
[12:08:11] <robertmaxrees> jikuja you need to call that in the done callback of your ajax function.
[12:08:22] <cjohnson> jb: no, for instance:  var foo = $('form'); foo.serialize()
[12:08:47] <cjohnson> obviously that would select all forms, so you'd want to limit the selector to just the form in question
[12:08:55] <jb> cjohnson: got it, thanks.
[12:09:58] <jikuja> robertmaxrees: yes, that's one of my plans, but how do I know when all ajax requests are done? e.g. when to run $("body").show();
[12:10:11] <robertmaxrees> jikuja you need to use deferreds/promises for that.
[12:10:49] <jb> cjohnson: nice, thats a much easier way to handle this.
[12:10:50] <robertmaxrees> register all your ajax requests into a queue and, when they all complete, run your callback.
[12:11:13] <cjohnson> can you use the native JS Promise.all method with jquery ajax "promises"?
[12:11:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery promises aren't currently spec compliant, so probably not.
[12:11:58] <robertmaxrees> also, IE.
[12:12:25] <jb> cjohnson: so, with serialize, how can I prevent an empty field from being POSTed?
[12:12:29] <cjohnson> yeah but there's the polyfill for IE right. still, shame
[12:12:47] <cjohnson> jb: you want to remove empty fields from the data object entirely?
[12:12:48] <jikuja> hmm
[12:12:52] <cjohnson> or just check that certain fields aren't empty
[12:12:57] <cjohnson> it would be the same if check as before
[12:13:03] <jb> cjohnson: I want to remove them.
[12:13:17] <cjohnson> delete obj.key;  if obj.key is empty
[12:13:19] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson there's work being done to make them compliant.
[12:13:22] <jb> cjohnson: if a user didn't fill in the "password" field (ie, he doesn't want to change his password), I have no reason to POST it.
[12:13:27] <prst331> robertmaxrees, i thought .live() and .on() had the same function signature. that was the problem.
[12:13:34] <cjohnson> jb: what's wrong with just posting an empty field?
[12:13:43] <robertmaxrees> prst331 ah. knew it was something simple :)
[12:14:03] <jb> cjohnson: it's either A) don't post it or B) have the script that is being called check for an empty field and discard it.
[12:14:06] <jb> I guess I could do either.
[12:14:21] <cjohnson> why discard? what are you doing?
[12:14:35] <cjohnson> user profile page and you don't want to change the password if they leave it blank?
[12:14:49] <cjohnson> if that's the case I would have the backend do the checking
[12:15:30] <cjohnson> in general, I would leave that sort of thing in the backend. if you can make your javascript forms degrade to standard POST without it breaking things that's a plus
[12:15:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day every day
[12:16:05] <prst331> robertmaxrees, i have .live() in some older scripts.  read that it's deprecated and  changed the fuction name...passing the parameters as if it were .live() lol
[12:16:08] <jb> cjohnson: yeah, user profile page.
[12:16:21] <jb> cjohnson: cool, I can handle it at the backend.
[12:16:25] <cjohnson> great
[12:16:32] <jb> cjohnson: thanks for the help.
[12:16:33] <robertmaxrees> prst331 yep - the documentation has some helpful info that tells you how to update your calls to .on() to work the same.
[12:17:10] <cjohnson> no prob
[12:17:22] <DavisV> cjohnson: Per your suggestion, I modified it with change and it works on jsfiddle - thanks for that! However, on my site, the character count shows up as NaN. Any ideas where to look? http://jsfiddle.net/h6xkow4s/3/
[12:17:51] <robertmaxrees> $(this).attr('maxlength'); probably isn't returning what you think it is.
[12:17:51] <cjohnson> DavisV: console.log (or use debugger) to inspect the values of your variables, make sure they're all numbers
[12:17:59] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() instead, too, btw.
[12:18:00] <DavisV> Got it
[12:23:33] <siaw> anyone knows why my jquery code won’t work? https://gist.github.com/siaw23/56daf94c5a336d7d4277 i’m working in rails
[12:24:05] <robertmaxrees> we'd need to see the rendered html.
[12:24:18] <cjohnson> is #id.class even valid?
[12:24:19] <cjohnson> and...why?
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[12:24:27] <cjohnson> ew
[12:25:53] <siaw> here’s the html rendered https://gist.github.com/siaw23/011758a1bf7c393b8ec5
[12:26:35] <cjohnson> your #flash node doesn't have class='hidden'
[12:26:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> you likely think you want $('#flash .hidden'), except nothin gin there has that class on it as far as I can see.
[12:27:00] <cjohnson> do you maybe mean :hidden ?
[12:27:27] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson look again at the markup - #flash is an empty div.
[12:27:58] <cjohnson> yeah, I'm not sure what the full context of the code is. I see it's empty in the source
[12:30:54] <siaw> hmmm i removed the .hidden:first and it’s still not working
[12:31:19] <robertmaxrees> siaw the rendered source you showed us has an empty #flash div.
[12:32:03] <siaw> robertmaxrees: you mean on line 47?
[12:32:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that's an empty div.
[12:41:58] <chriscalip> hello I am curious if this functionality exist .. i want to listen on div element and all of its children on any events happening to it.. and specifically what javascript function or scripts are triggering on those elements
[12:42:21] <chriscalip> any way to profile that?
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> developer tools can tell you about bindings.
[12:44:34] <siaw> robertmaxrees: no it’s not empty, inside is a ruby code to render the flash message
[12:44:54] <robertmaxrees> siaw show us the actual code that gets put out.
[12:44:55] <miznitic> How does one change the fill value of an svg loaded from a css file?
[12:45:05] <robertmaxrees> siaw not the page.
[12:45:47] <siaw> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/siaw23/c7399ed707f008255968
[12:45:59] <frank_o> Hi! Anybody know of any articles explaining why CoffeeScript is bad?
[12:46:02] <cjohnson> the actual rendered HTML where you have a flash message siaw
[12:46:26] <cjohnson> there is no node with class='hidden' in anything you've pasted
[12:46:35] <siaw> https://gist.github.com/siaw23/011758a1bf7c393b8ec5
[12:46:35] <cjohnson> also there's a comma in that paste after the class
[12:46:58] <cjohnson> the #flash node in that link is empty
[12:48:02] <siaw> cjohnson: this is how it looks now https://gist.github.com/siaw23/246093b310cd2f857781
[12:48:15] <cjohnson> look at line 47
[12:48:25] <siaw> i see it
[12:48:33] <cjohnson> it's an empty div. so your selector isn't selecting anything
[12:48:56] <siaw> that it’s empty. BUT in the ruby code there’s SOMETHING, the message. and on the browser the message shows
[12:49:41] <cjohnson> right. so activate that code that makes it render the flash message. and then paste us that rendered HTML. as well as your current JS. if you can use jsfiddle that would be good too
[12:50:02] <cjohnson> you'll probably have to inspect the element directly to get the source
[12:50:10] <cjohnson> view source makes a new request generally
[12:51:55] <siaw> but you have to know i’m working with ruby on rails here :) not pure html
[12:52:03] <frank_o> oOoOOoOOooo
[12:52:06] <frank_o> http://procbits.com/2012/05/18/why-do-all-the-great-node-js-developers-hate-coffeescript
[12:52:12] <cjohnson> javascript doesn't care what rendered your HTML siaw
[12:52:18] <cjohnson> I understand you're using backend code to generate HTML
[12:52:32] * frank_o seconds cjohnson 
[12:53:46] <Pinchiukas> I have this array: "nagios_urls = new Array(); nagios_urls['prod']='someurl';" and I'm trying to iterate like so: "$.each(nagios_urls, function(i){console.log(i)} );" and it prints me nothing! Why is that?
[12:54:17] <siaw> current staty of my files now https://gist.github.com/siaw23/aa59fef38a528c9e95cb
[12:55:50] <cjohnson>  Pinchiukas that should be an object if you don't want to use numeric keys
[12:56:15] <cjohnson> $.each won't iterate over an array without numeric keys
[12:56:34] <cjohnson> nagios_urls = {};  will make it work
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> also don't use constructors for stuff like arrays and objects :)
[12:57:42] <robertmaxrees> siaw  html_on_browser.html
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> that file still has that empty div.
[12:58:29] <siaw> robertmaxrees: hmmmm the content that’s supposed to be in there is rendered by ruby
[13:12:32] <Hypfer> hello, I need a simple search bar that starts an ajax call after someone entered something
[13:13:32] <Hypfer> how do I know if someone is done typing?
[13:14:12] <NoiseEee> Hypfer: generally those type of things don't wait for 'done typing' but for min. number of letters entered. anyways, peek at http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[13:14:30] <NoiseEee> if thats what you're asking for (sounds like it)
[13:16:04] <Hypfer> hmm I don't need something special for a simple search box that just accepts enter, right?
[13:16:41] <NoiseEee> no, that would be a non-ajax, regular form post
[13:17:43] <Hypfer> NoiseEee: but how do I do something with the enter key but without reloading the page? (I want to do an api call with the textfield value and update some kind of div with the result)
[13:17:59] <NoiseEee> well sure then that can be XHR if you really want
[13:18:33] <prst331> Code: $(e).replaceWith("<input>"); ... is there a similar function that returns the reference to the input element created?
[13:18:35] <NoiseEee> enter/submit button (basically form submitting) would cancel the default event (the proper form submission) and instead send an ajax call with the search parameters
[13:18:49] <NoiseEee> ^^ @ hypfer
[13:18:56] <prst331> Apart from creating the element with createElement()
[13:19:01] <Hypfer> NoiseEee: do you have a quick fiddle for that? :)
[13:19:22] <NoiseEee> Hypfer: nope thats something you can/should come up with :)
[13:19:38] <doug64k> Hypfer: your root problem sounds like enter being bound to submit
[13:20:04] <doug64k> NoiseEee's suggestion would allow you to stop the submit that would happen
[13:20:52] <doug64k> Hypfer: you can handle an event when the submit tries to happen, and if you event.preventDefault() it stops the submit
[13:23:42] <doug64k> Hypfer: http://www.jstraight.com/1168/1
[13:27:30] <Hypfer> doug64k: nice, thanks :)
[13:29:05] <Hypfer> doug64k: do I have to do $(document) or can I just do a specific form?
[13:29:21] <doug64k> Hypfer: you can do it that way sure
[13:29:27] <doug64k> no special requirement
[13:29:41] <doug64k> must be submit event of the form
[13:29:54] <doug64k> any way you can get that event is good
[13:30:12] <Hypfer> <form id="searchBox"> $("#searchBox") doesn't work on that :/
[13:30:33] <doug64k> bet it does
[13:30:55] <Hypfer> nope, reloads the page
[13:31:04] <doug64k> http://www.jstraight.com/1168/2
[13:31:12] <frank_o> Hi! Why do you guys prefer not to use dollar signs in variables?
[13:31:56] <Hypfer> doug64k: http://jsfiddle.net/qw5ajk7k/
[13:31:57] <doug64k> many languages dont allow $ in identifiers
[13:32:39] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/qw5ajk7k/1/
[13:32:43] <doug64k> Hypfer: ^
[13:33:04] <doug64k> Hypfer: if you bind straight on the element, dont pass a selector
[13:33:11] <Hypfer> oh
[13:33:12] <doug64k> 'form'  <-- that
[13:33:14] <Hypfer> m(
[13:33:16] <Hypfer> thanks!
[13:34:00] <frank_o> doug64k: "Using a $ to indicate that a variable represents a cached jquery selector is a useful tip and leads to more readable code base (has worked real well for me)."
[13:34:05] <frank_o> doug64k: What would you say to this guy? :)
[13:34:34] <frank_o> Or rather, what should I put here: "But Doug told me that ..."
[13:34:55] <doug64k> I would say, as long as the code consistently does it, go for it
[13:35:02] <doug64k> there is no best way
[13:35:05] <BillCriswell> "Doug told me his opinion is different from yours." lol
[13:35:19] <frank_o> hehe
[13:35:21] <frank_o> Thanks
[13:35:27] <Hypfer> wtf
[13:35:33] <Hypfer> it still wont work?
[13:36:34] <Hypfer> it works in the fiddle, though
[13:37:25] <frank_o> So there are no counter-arguments though?
[13:37:42] <doug64k> Hypfer: go here and view source, this is what my site generates for the page output: http://www.jstraight.com/1168/2/show
[13:37:50] <doug64k> no magic
[13:38:14] <Hypfer> doug64k: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/7a190749/ this is my site. I have no idea whats wrong oO
[13:38:24] <frank_o> Ie. some people find the $ visually disturbing? Or that it is purely cosmetic and that a representation of a cached jquery selector doesnt really contribute much when it's all said and done?
[13:39:29] <cjohnson> I tend to make variables only use alphanumeric + underscore just to ensure they're always accessible via dot object notation
[13:39:35] <doug64k> frank_o: the natural reaction to $ should be "really? most languages cant use that", then just to be clever, people went and started using $ everywhere. why?
[13:39:52] <BillCriswell> .$foo is ok
[13:39:55] <cjohnson> foo.a_b is better to me than foo['a-b']  so I just keep it simple with var names
[13:39:56] <jikuja> btw is there tools to check missing $s in variable names if user decides to use $?
[13:40:07] <cjohnson> right but I can't always remember what is valid or not
[13:40:12] <cjohnson> so as a rule I avoid anything that isn't letters or numbers
[13:40:15] <cjohnson> or _
[13:40:23] <frank_o> doug64k: Great
[13:40:24] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Got ya.
[13:40:59] <doug64k> I thought $ was chosen because it is almost guaranteed that nobody would even try $, let alone having to deal with conflicts
[13:41:06] <cjohnson> I bind $ to a PHP interpreter written in javascript and I use it to run PHP in the browser
[13:41:23] <BillCriswell> now everyone wants in on that sweet $.
[13:41:26] <miznitic> Is it possible to change the opacity/fill of an externally loaded SVG (e.g, stylesheet -> background-image) on hover?
[13:41:33] <frank_o> lol
[13:41:34] <doug64k> now everyone uses $ and it backfired into something that everyone uses :D
[13:41:57] <Hypfer> doug64k: do you see whats wrong? because I don't :(
[13:41:58] <dan_j> Hi. I need to submit an ajax post and then wait for a server process to complete. The whole thing takes about 60 seconds to complete but the initial ajax post returns instantly. I need to poll using another ajax post every few seconds to find out if the server process is complete. Whats the best way to display a modal dialog box while the process is
[13:41:58] <dan_j> occurring?
[13:42:16] <cjohnson> Hypfer: check your console for errors
[13:42:23] <doug64k> Hypfer: yes I see
[13:42:25] <cjohnson> Hypfer: oh, also, move your JS above </body>
[13:42:31] <cjohnson> or wait with document.read
[13:42:32] <cjohnson> y
[13:42:33] <doug64k> you are running that code before the element exists
[13:42:48] <doug64k> Hypfer: if you did it like I showed you with event delegation, this problem wouldnt exist lol
[13:42:50] <BillCriswell> dan_j: Start it initially, then run the check every x seconds till it's finished, then hide it.
[13:42:51] <Hypfer> ah!
[13:43:01] <doug64k> Hypfer: I didnt show it with event delegation to look cool
[13:43:23] <Hypfer> lol. didn't know that that makes a difference
[13:43:28] <cjohnson> you look cool anyway doug64k
[13:43:30] <cjohnson> 8)
[13:46:02] <dan_j> BillCriswell: how do I set up some code to run a check every few seconds?
[13:46:08] <cjohnson> setTimeout
[13:46:24] <cjohnson> or setInterval
[13:46:34] <dan_j> BillCriswell: And what would you recommend for the modal dialog? Just use the jqueryUI dialog?
[13:47:03] <cjohnson> I prefer explicitly chaining them (also guarantees it will wait until 60 seconds after the request completes) by having each success handler call setTimeout for the next check
[13:47:18] <cjohnson> jquery ui dialog is good yes if you already have jquery ui. if not, there are lighter ones
[13:47:24] <cjohnson> whatever one you like most
[13:47:25] <frank_o> doug64k, BillCriswell: "The ones I've spoken to say `$` has no concrete function, that it's visually disturbing, that it was chosen because no other language use it, and that everyone jumped on the bandwagon for no real reason like with Twitter Bootstrap, CSS grid frameworks or Ylvis - The Fox (http://youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE)."
[13:47:50] <cjohnson> "for no real reason like CSS grid frameworks" lol
[13:48:33] <dan_j> Thanks.
[13:49:09] <[]Tsukasa[]> is there a plugin that will allow me to center and resize an image with the browser? My div container is a % and the image inside it is 100% so when the contain adjusts the image resizes but I need to keep it centered and still resize with the window
[13:49:13] <frank_o> cjohnson: It's for https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/issues/255 - their guide is pretty sweet.
[13:51:27] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: I doubt you need a plugin
[13:51:52] <cjohnson> they suggest that grids have no purpose?
[13:51:55] <cjohnson> or you are?
[13:51:58] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k I've been trying for a day now and haven't gotten anywhere
[13:52:29] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: what do you mean by resize
[13:52:36] <doug64k> meaning it changes size?
[13:53:10] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k: when the user resizes the browser it will scale with it
[13:53:36] <frank_o> cjohnson: That they have purpose but that transferring them programatically onto their HTML and CSS is pointless.
[13:53:53] <frank_o> In fact they are perhaps the most important element in design ever.
[13:53:55] <[]Tsukasa[]> I have it scaling by using percentage but it wont center without giving it an actual size
[13:54:06] <frank_o> * onto ones
[13:54:30] <cjohnson> frank_o: what else would you propose to make responsive designs in HTML/CSS than something grid-like?
[13:54:41] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: done: http://www.jstraight.com/1169/1
[13:55:04] <frank_o> cjohnson: wont CSS media queries do?
[13:55:42] <frank_o> cjohnson: also if alignment is what you need you could do something like http://hashgrid.com/
[13:56:32] <cjohnson> the CSS media queries work by using some kind of defined division structure -- a grid
[13:57:53] <cjohnson> I'm not sure what hashgrid is meant for...
[13:58:15] <cjohnson> not the same thing though I don't think
[13:58:16] <frank_o> Yep. Any HTML with a <div> can be called a division structure though
[13:58:33] <frank_o> i think you have to press some key on your keyboard and this grid will appear on top of your layout
[13:58:44] <cjohnson> right, I don't get what that has to do with css grids
[13:58:58] <frank_o> so if you want to align your layout in terms of the graphic design / architectural notion of grids then you're good to go
[13:58:58] <cjohnson> it's _defined_ division structure, that's my point
[13:59:10] <frank_o> well that's the true nature of a grid
[13:59:25] <frank_o> ie. http://www.slideshare.net/huer1278ft/grids-are-good-right
[13:59:33] <cjohnson> css grid is just the name of the technique, they're not strictly talking about literal grids
[14:00:45] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: http://www.jstraight.com/1169/2
[14:01:11] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k: http://www.jstraight.com/1169/3
[14:01:23] <frank_o> i dont know. they look related to me. i just dont understand why one should complicate ones html with unnecessary divisions and a bunch of .col-NN-NN classes just to do something basic css media queries can do to normal semantic html
[14:01:49] <cjohnson> it would be extremely complex CSS or very simplified HTML
[14:01:56] <cjohnson> it effectively _is_ using media queries
[14:02:41] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k the logo should scale like the text is
[14:02:45] <cjohnson> it costs more developer hours to try to write CSS to cover your exact use cases and their exceptions than to just put some of the layout markup into the HTML
[14:02:52] <cjohnson> for your typical HTML/CSS person
[14:03:02] <frank_o> sure yeah
[14:03:31] <cjohnson> that's a huge reason for using grids. reduces developer time. lets you write scalable interfaces
[14:03:46] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: I need to resize my browser to see?
[14:04:09] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: sounds like you want to make the width of the image be a percentage of its parents width
[14:04:10] <frank_o> lets agree to disagree. i can write responsive layouts using simple css and simple html.
[14:04:36] <cjohnson> you're either writing much more CSS or you're giving up flexibility
[14:04:45] <cjohnson> or you're writing CSS that isn't very portable
[14:04:48] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: http://www.jstraight.com/1169/4
[14:04:48] <frank_o> no im not. i promise :)
[14:04:58] <cjohnson> feel free to demonstrate
[14:05:00] <frank_o> frankie has it all covered
[14:05:06] <techkudu> just float your divs left, boom grid
[14:05:15] <frank_o> yep
[14:05:17] <frank_o> or flexbox
[14:05:39] <frank_o> http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/
[14:06:15] <cjohnson> we live in reality where users are still on IE
[14:06:20] <cjohnson> that's great in theory
[14:06:23] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: http://www.jstraight.com/1169/5
[14:07:01] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k: arg thanks talk about over complicating it ...
[14:07:24] <doug64k> ?
[14:09:11] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k: It's working now. http://www.jstraight.com/1169/6   now what about getting the entire thing to center vertically ?
[14:09:25] <doug64k> you can do that
[14:09:34] <Hypfer> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9027237/teststuff/index.html so, I wanted this to select just the checkbox in that one row.. why does it select all of them?
[14:10:12] <cjohnson> paste your JS Hypfer
[14:10:20] <cjohnson> I don't see any JS at all in there
[14:10:29] <Hypfer> cjohnson: its right there on the bottom. just scroll down a bit :)
[14:10:37] <cjohnson> oh there's a big whitespace
[14:10:55] <cjohnson> Hypfer: once you're inside $('#searchBox').on..., you can use $(this) to refer to the form
[14:11:07] <cjohnson> so if ($(this).serialize() != 'q=') {
[14:11:32] <cjohnson> same deal inside your click handler, you're re-selecting all the elements with your selector
[14:11:37] <cjohnson> instead of making them relative to this
[14:12:11] <cjohnson> I would bind to the tr instead of the table itself
[14:12:20] <amh345> is there a way to get $.inArray(value, array) to act as a true/false?
[14:12:28] <cjohnson> then you can do $(this).find('input[type=checkbox]') to find and check the checkbox
[14:12:51] <cjohnson> amh345: > -1
[14:12:56] <cjohnson> it returns the index
[14:13:09] <cjohnson> or -1 for not found
[14:13:13] <Hypfer> cjohnson: huh? I dont see where I'm reselecting stuff in the document ready function
[14:13:19] <cjohnson> $(':checkbox')
[14:13:24] <cjohnson> selects all items matching :checkbox
[14:13:30] <cjohnson> line 107
[14:13:51] <amh345> cjohnson: so is the best way to handle the condition if (in array) == -1)  the way to deal with it?
[14:13:54] <cjohnson> you're limited context to the table with this, but obviously there is more than one checkbox in the table
[14:14:10] <cjohnson> so change what "this" refers to -- make your selector "#resultTable tr"
[14:14:28] <amh345> looks to work ok.
[14:14:41] <cjohnson> amh345: I would use === but yeah
[14:15:22] <amh345> ah ok. thanks.
[14:15:28] <Hypfer> cjohnson: so the this in the document ready handler is basically the whole table, right?
[14:15:58] <cjohnson> yes, this refers to the element that emitted the event, which is #resultTable in this case
[14:16:22] <cjohnson> if you make your selector #resultTable tr, it will make the trs emit the event instead of the table
[14:17:00] <Hypfer> cjohnson: if I make the selector #resultTable tr it just checks no checkbox at all oO
[14:17:51] <cjohnson> update your dropbox code
[14:18:20] <Hypfer> cjohnson: done. and uploaded
[14:19:03] <cjohnson> the jquery reference stopped working, can you fix that too?
[14:19:13] <cjohnson> are you getting the console.log?
[14:19:21] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: http://www.jstraight.com/1170/1
[14:19:51] <cjohnson> the data stopped loading for me to test with as well. but this worked fine for me btw:
[14:19:54] <cjohnson> $('#resultTable tr').on('click', function() { $(this).find(':checkbox').click(); });
[14:19:56] <doug64k> whatever size you force that .screen div to be, it will be center and vertical middle
[14:20:08] <doug64k> the blue box thing will be centered/middle
[14:20:16] <Hypfer> cjohnson: whoops. my fault. updated now. no, I dont get the console.log
[14:20:29] <cjohnson> can you bring the data back too?
[14:21:20] <Hypfer> cjohnson: there it is
[14:21:21] <cjohnson> seems to work fine on this end now
[14:21:29] <doug64k> []Tsukasa[]: the .screen class only needs the position thing
[14:21:47] <Hypfer> wtf. it does work on that static page
[14:21:49] <doug64k> and something to enforce the size
[14:22:06] <Hypfer> but it doesn't with dynamically added content
[14:22:39] <Hypfer> cjohnson: do I have to update the selector or something when I push new data into that table?
[14:27:13] <Hypfer> yeah, when I add new data to that static example it wont work on that, cjohnson
[14:27:35] <[]Tsukasa[]> doug64k: Thanks for all the help. That is a lot less work then I have been trying
[14:27:46] <doug64k> np
[14:29:46] <Franck78> Hello all,
[14:29:46] <Franck78> I would like to find a plugin or example but don't know how to formulate the search!
[14:29:46] <Franck78> My page contains 200 repeated <article>...</article>
[14:29:46] <Franck78> I want a textbox input that will for each new char call a function that will filter-out
[14:29:46] <Franck78> <article> not-matching the string. jquery plugin ?
[14:30:02] <doug64k> Hypfer: you probably want $('#resultTable').on('click', function(event) { var row = $(event.target).closest('tr'); })
[14:30:43] <Hypfer> doug64k: will that work with dynamically added elements?
[14:32:15] <Hypfer> the answer is: yes
[14:32:18] <Hypfer> thanks again
[14:32:39] <frank_o> doug64k: Got a response to the whole $ thing: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/issues/255#issuecomment-63725388
[14:33:11] <doug64k> Hypfer: i COULDNT answer because hexchat decided to go haywire again
[14:33:19] <doug64k> oops capslock
[14:33:29] <doug64k> np
[14:34:20] <doug64k> holding backspace was cycling through some corrupted undo chain or something. it was funny the first few seconds until I realized that I was unable to enter text in the input field without extra garbage adding
[14:34:29] <doug64k> thats native code for ya
[14:34:47] <Hypfer> irssi ftw.
[14:34:52] <Hypfer> or telnet irc :>
[14:36:54] <Terminus> hello. how can i use a jquery ui toggle if the parent of 'this' is class '.foo'? i've tried $(this).parent('.foo').children(this).toggle('blind') but it's not working as expected.
[14:38:22] <Terminus> doing $(this).parent('.foo').children().toggle('blind') toggles all of the children, not just 'this'.
[14:38:33] <doug64k> Terminus: you want $(this).parent().is('.foo')
[14:38:44] <doug64k> to see if the parent has class .foo
[14:38:55] <doug64k> or
[14:38:57] <doug64k> hasClass
[14:39:11] <doug64k> if you use hasClass then drop the .
[14:39:21] <andrew9183> is it sufficient just to bind touchstart, or should i really be using hammer.js
[14:39:38] <doug64k> Terminus: if you use .is it will chain
[14:40:04] <doug64k> Terminus: oops, sorry, .filter will chain
[14:40:09] <doug64k> .is returns bool
[14:40:21] <Terminus> doug64k: i'm looking for documention regarding .is() and .hasClass() right now. thanks.
[14:40:25] <amh345> so the code i wrote didn't actually do what i wanted at all.
[14:40:30] <Hypfer> hm.. so now I have a button that iterates over all checked tr. How can I do an ajax request with the content of the 3 td in that tr?
[14:41:05] <doug64k> Terminus: you want to see if the parent of $(this) has a certain class, and if it does, then toggle $(this) ?
[14:41:08] <amh345> so i have a question.   i have an array of ids. >>>   product_array = [954,955,956,957,958,959,960]    and i want to check if a call has any of them.  to do it statically i do >> $('.form').find("[data-productid=954]");
[14:41:21] <amh345> is there a clean way i can do a .find on that array?
[14:41:30] <Terminus> doug64k: yep, that's wha ti want.
[14:41:59] <Terminus> so hasClass() returns a boolean. i guess this means i just use it with 'if'?
[14:42:14] <amh345> err call == class.
[14:42:15] <doug64k> Terminus: $(this).filter(function() { return $(this).parent().hasClass('.foo'); }).toggle('blind');
[14:42:31] <doug64k> Terminus: or an if using .is
[14:43:21] <Terminus> doug64k: ah... i should read the documentation about filter() some more.
[14:43:54] <doug64k> Terminus: it calls that function for each incoming element, and puts it in the result if it returns truthy
[14:43:56] <amh345> i guess i have to loop through the product_array and .find on each val.   i was hoping there was a quicker/cleaner way.
[14:44:24] <doug64k> Terminus: filter returns a jQuery that has the elements that passed the filter
[14:45:26] <Terminus> doug64k: got it. thanks again! =)
[14:45:31] <doug64k> Terminus: so i my suggestion, it might call the filter callback with an element that doesn't have the right parent class, then it will return false, and .filter will return a 0 element selector
[14:45:32] <doug64k> np
[14:46:21] <Terminus> my eyes skipped the part where filter() accepts a function as a parameter. =)
[14:47:55] <doug64k> amh345: you want an efficient way to lookup by id?
[14:48:40] <amh345> doug64k: yes.  if the id does not exist, I'm trying to return false (not let something be added to cart)
[14:48:55] <alexut> is there any way i can link all the select input values with some table html without going trough each one of them, i have about 20 selects and inputs... and trying to find an easy way to do it jsfiddle.net/2hdheanf/
[14:48:59] <amh345> i've got something here, sort of. but it's a bit messy.   ill post it when i have it fully functional.
[14:50:01] <alexut> http://jsfiddle.net/2hdheanf/ *ups
[14:51:10] <doug64k> amh345: build a lookup table like this: var productLookup = $('.form [data-productid]').toArray().reduce(function(obj, elem) { var e = $(elem); obj[e.data('productid'] = elem; return obj; }, {});
[14:51:50] <doug64k> then to find the element for product id, var toFind = 1234;  var elem = productLookup[toFind];
[14:51:59] <doug64k> it will be undefined if not found
[14:52:01] <cjohnson> Hypfer: yes, you'll have to change that to use event delegation
[14:52:24] <cjohnson> Hypfer: $('#resultTable').on('click', 'tr', function...
[14:52:24] <amh345> thanks doug.  i will try.
[14:52:38] <doug64k> amh345: I missed closing ) in the .data call btw
[14:52:42] <amh345> doug64k: are you the same doug i had to some freelance awhile ago?
[14:52:54] <amh345> like a long while ago?
[14:53:03] <doug64k> hired?
[14:53:13] <amh345> well, just a few hours here and there.
[14:53:21] <doug64k> maybe :)
[14:53:27] <amh345> does your last name start with an M ?
[14:53:30] <doug64k> no
[14:53:33] <amh345> ok. not you.
[14:53:33] <amh345> hah
[14:53:52] <doug64k> amh345: does my suggestion make sense to you?
[14:54:00] <amh345> I'm looking at it now.
[14:54:24] <dan_j> Is there any reason why a 3000 delay for setTimeout would trigger instantly?
[14:54:40] <doug64k> amh345: it generates an object with one property per id, that refers to the element. then you can lookup by id and get the element that had that product id attribute
[14:55:07] <doug64k> blazingly fast for repeated lookups
[14:55:15] <doug64k> compared to doing it against the dom over and over
[14:55:45] <doug64k> assuming you build the table once then repeat the lookup :)
[14:56:04] <cjohnson> dan_j: I bet you did something like setTimeout(aFunc(), 3000)
[14:56:09] <cjohnson> instead of setTimeout(aFunc, 3000)
[14:56:37] <dan_j> cjohnson: What happens if I want to pass a variable into the Func?
[14:56:46] <cjohnson> you need to wrap it or use .bind
[14:56:58] <doug64k> reduces passes in {} to a the first time, then each subsequent call gets what the last call returned in a
[14:57:04] <amh345> doug64k: your var toFind = 1234;   I'm not sure if i totally get it... but there will be no static id.
[14:57:09] <amh345> i should say.
[14:57:21] <doug64k> amh345: I know - it represents some dynamic value
[14:57:48] <amh345> well, the dynamic value would be one of many ids that would be predefined in product_array = [954,955,956,957,958,959,960]
[14:57:51] <doug64k> shows that you put the id in the [] when you access the lookup table
[14:57:55] <dan_j> cjohnson: can I call another function using Settimeout?
[14:58:04] <cjohnson> dan_j: what do you mean?
[14:58:06] <dan_j> Without () or any parameters
[14:58:13] <doug64k> amh345: yeah do that
[14:58:14] <cjohnson> need to elaborate on that
[14:58:38] <dan_j> Don't worry. Ignore that. Let me give it a go.
[14:58:42] <dan_j> Thanks
[14:59:31] <cjohnson> don't peak if you want to figure it out yourself, but basically: http://jsfiddle.net/3p7kbf4b/
[14:59:45] <doug64k> amh345: ignore the =1234 - it was jst an example showing that toFind is an id
[15:00:00] <amh345> doug64k: when i make var toFind = [954,955,956,957,958,959,960];  and run everything it returns undefined overtime.
[15:00:06] <amh345> but I'm going to poke around.
[15:00:51] <doug64k> amh345: [954,955,956,957,958,959,960].forEach(function(v) { var elem = productLookup[v]; if (elem !== undefined) { ... found it ...
[15:01:50] <doug64k> amh345: ... var je = $(elem); console.log(je.attr('something')); ...
[15:02:03] <alexut> is there any way i can link all the select input values with some table cells, i have about 20 selects and inputs... and trying to find an easy way to do it... http://jsfiddle.net/2hdheanf/
[15:02:23] <cjohnson> "link all the select input values with some table cells" meaning what
[15:02:56] <doug64k> amh345: the 'v' variable might be better named 'productId'
[15:03:07] <cjohnson> alexut: do you want the dropdown to populate that row's third column?
[15:03:14] <cjohnson> without having to specify the classname with numbers?
[15:03:53] <alexut> cjohnson : yes
[15:04:13] <cjohnson> alexut: could you add an ID to each td?
[15:04:21] <alexut> yes
[15:04:34] <cjohnson> you could put a data attr on the <select> that points to the td's ID
[15:04:38] <cjohnson> I'll give you an example
[15:04:44] <alexut> thanks
[15:05:24] <cjohnson> alternatively, could you restructure the code so the select is in the table itself?
[15:05:33] <cjohnson> so each select is in the same row as its label field
[15:05:42] <cjohnson> that would make it even easier
[15:07:04] <alexut> cjohnson: sorry that would not be possible.
[15:07:30] <doug64k> alexut: how do you know which row is which?
[15:07:40] <doug64k> is something on the row identifying it ?
[15:07:48] <cjohnson> seems like row index based on select index
[15:08:06] <doug64k> you can find a row of a table by number
[15:08:11] <cjohnson> which is messy. using classes or some kind of rel/data attribute would be better but takes a lot more markup
[15:08:23] <amh345> doug64k: i think i got your code working.  thank you!
[15:08:59] <doug64k> alexut: $('sometable tr').eq(index)   <-- gives you the index'th row of the table that the sometable selector selects
[15:09:18] <alexut> i can modify the html code add id's classe, but the table and form need to be separated
[15:09:43] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/z3hyucpc/  here's how you would do it if you could put them in the same table
[15:09:55] <doug64k> amh345: np
[15:11:08] <cjohnson> alexut: if you can't, here you go http://jsfiddle.net/2hdheanf/1/
[15:11:18] <Respek> so, to edit all links in a section with ID of me, I would: $("section#me").find('a').each(function() {
[15:11:35] <Respek> is the find even required?
[15:11:40] <cjohnson> Respek: you probably don't need the .each, depends which changes you are making
[15:11:51] <cjohnson> and you could use $('section#me a') for the same thing
[15:11:57] <doug64k> #me can't be duplicated so the section is superfluous and adds checking overhead
[15:12:00] <cjohnson> also section#me is redundant
[15:12:01] <cjohnson> yep
[15:12:41] <doug64k> $('#me').find('a')   why not  ->  $('#me a')
[15:13:37] <Respek> ok, makes sense, so I'm hurting efficiency with that way? seems like its more readable, but that wouldn't really be worth it
[15:13:43] <cjohnson> yes
[15:13:52] <doug64k> better way: have some variable that represents some root of some subtree of elements, and do $('a', startAt)
[15:13:54] <cjohnson> #me uses document.getElementById which is faster than jquery
[15:14:14] <Respek> ok, what about section#me vs #me, much of a difference there?
[15:14:19] <doug64k> cjohnson: sure, then it turns around and calls find
[15:14:34] <cjohnson> m?
[15:14:51] <cjohnson> I'm just talking about section#me vs #me
[15:14:53] <cjohnson> #me is better
[15:15:01] <Respek> ok I see
[15:15:15] <doug64k> Respek: saying section obfuscates the #me imho. #me is unique and either exists or doesn't. adding section just makes it be 0 result if the tag name is not section
[15:15:54] <doug64k> the browser will actually execute more stuff in the selector matcher and make sure that it really is a section tagname
[15:15:59] <doug64k> why make it bother?
[15:16:03] <Respek> I see, and obv that doesn't change things  in this case
[15:16:43] <Respek> well thanks, this is what I ended up w/ http://pastebin.com/VDzkGgKY
[15:17:07] <cjohnson> use prop not attr, and I don't think you need the .each
[15:17:10] <Respek> I appreciate you all teaching me the backstory to why :) very cool
[15:18:36] <Respek> wow, so just $('#me a').prop('href', '#icon1');
[15:18:37] <cjohnson> Respek: http://jsfiddle.net/k9pf2tf4/
[15:18:41] <doug64k> side note I should mention: if there were a section with id="me" and some other tag name, like article with id tag name, you would NOT be able to do section#me or arcticle#me   duplicating ID is illegal and wont work
[15:18:48] <cjohnson> most jquery methods will operate on entire collections
[15:18:58] <cjohnson> (in fact a single jquery element is a collection with the size of one)
[15:19:03] <doug64k> oops I meant, two different tag names with the same id
[15:19:39] <d0de> I'm putting a very small app on github. How should I indicate it depends on jQuery? Is there some standard manifest format I should use?
[15:19:56] <Respek> hence why ID are used once religiously,
[15:20:05] <cjohnson> put it in the readme and comments, beyond that there are a multitude of ways of defining dependencies
[15:20:07] <Respek> !g jquerycdn
[15:20:08] <d0de> something that isn't tied to a framework or node.js or anything
[15:20:08] <b-ot> Respek: jQuery CDN → https://code.jquery.com/
[15:20:08] <cjohnson> but no true standard
[15:20:32] <doug64k> it is a restriction that basically says, if you promise never to duplicate them, I promise that looking them up is absolutely instantaneous
[15:21:02] <doug64k> it ignores dups in that super fast lookup system
[15:22:18] <d0de> cjohnson, thanks
[15:24:50] <Respek> wow, that's awesome
[15:25:12] <Respek> so I really aught to stop targeting unique classes, because of the rules
[15:27:40] <doug64k> Respek: all selectors are fast enough when they are used once in startup code. don't even worry about those selectors too much, they will be milliseconds. only worry about repeatedly looked up selectors, and factor them so you keep a reference instead of repetition
[15:28:58] <uskerine> hi, what should be used to ensure that the web browser sends AJAX post using UTF-8? I have an app which works fine with firefox but not with chrome, and inspecting the headers I see that firefox adds utf-8 to application/json but chrome does not
[15:30:50] <doug64k> uskerine: specify mimeType in $.ajax
[15:31:30] <uskerine> doug64k, what about using: contentType: 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
[15:31:35] <uskerine> is it the same?
[15:31:49] <doug64k> yes do that
[15:32:04] <uskerine> ok thanks
[15:32:28] <cjohnson> jquery docs suggest it defaults to UTF8
[15:32:30] <doug64k> uskerine: "The W3C XMLHttpRequest specification dictates that the charset is always UTF-8; specifying another charset will not force the browser to change the encoding"
[15:32:32] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[15:32:51] <uskerine> I will try with that to see if that fix the issue
[15:33:02] <doug64k> uskerine: your server wants to see it?
[15:33:11] <uskerine> while inspecting information with firefox and chrome that's the only difference I can notice
[15:33:31] <uskerine> doug64k, what do you mean with "wants to see it"?
[15:33:34] <alexut> cjohnson : i've succesfully done it this way, http://jsfiddle.net/2hdheanf/4/ can you tell me i can improve code ?
[15:34:08] <doug64k> uskerine: adding it will only make it send more data on each request unless your server code needs it
[15:34:10] <cjohnson> your name attribute is missing = alexut
[15:34:40] <cjohnson> the only thing I can see there is if something else uses the same class as one of these elements, that's why I used an id
[15:34:49] <cjohnson> but it seems fine enough
[15:34:54] <uskerine> yeah my server backend requires UTF-8, otherwise local vowels and stuff are not properly handled in Chrome
[15:35:14] <doug64k> cjohnson: when are there multiple with the same class, and you don't want to do each one?
[15:35:21] <uskerine> -I mean localized characters-
[15:35:39] <cjohnson> I'm talking about class name collision
[15:35:45] <cjohnson> if you're sure there won't be any, it's fine
[15:35:59] <alexut> thanks cjohnson really apreciate.
[15:36:37] <doug64k> you should have an id to identify the exact id when you have it, but you should use class names to identify *what it is* not which one it is
[15:37:18] <cjohnson> I would prefer to use a data attribute in that case
[15:37:26] <doug64k> then you can have rows that uniformly all use the same class name and one piece of code does infinite instances
[15:37:27] <cjohnson> instead of competing with CSS
[15:37:32] <cjohnson> but sure
[15:40:12] <Terminus> question about jquery ui. when using toggle(), how can i specify the direction of for example a drop effect?
[15:40:49] <Terminus> can i just add it to options like { direction: 'up' }?
[15:41:48] <cjohnson> how is it a toggle if you're specifying the direction?
[15:41:57] <doug64k> yes a data attribute for the id
[15:42:32] <doug64k> Terminus: try .toggle('up')  (I think)
[15:43:00] <doug64k> Terminus: to hide or show with a boolean? use toggle and pass true or false  .toggle(shouldShow)
[15:43:59] <Terminus> doug64k: i mean for example the default direction of 'drop' is 'left' so it will toggle in that direction. what if i want it to toggle in a different direction?
[15:44:01] <doug64k> Terminus: to slide, you have to do it manually because they apparently forgot to add the overload that accepts a bool to signify up or down
[15:44:24] <doug64k> Terminus: on what element?
[15:44:29] <doug64k> is this jquery ui?
[15:44:47] <Terminus> doug64k: yeah, this is jquery ui. on an <li>. trying to add sliding effects to a menu.
[15:44:48] <doug64k> ah yeah jquery ui fixes slideToggle...
[15:45:40] <doug64k> Terminus: left?
[15:46:03] <Terminus> doug64k: up and down. on hover, slide down, on mouseout, slide back up.
[15:46:35] <cjohnson> you'll probably have to use the $.slide method directly, toggle generally assumes a lot of defaults
[15:46:37] <doug64k> Terminus: where is slide left and right -> http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/
[15:46:47] <cjohnson> er $.hide/show with slide
[15:47:03] <cjohnson> or $.animate, I forget which would be applicable
[15:47:25] <Terminus> doug64k: oh, i was looking at http://api.jqueryui.com/drop-effect/
[15:47:59] <doug64k> Terminus: you probably want to .animate({height: '100%'})   or    .animate({height: '0%'})
[15:49:00] <doug64k> Terminus: or better. let me test
[15:49:21] <Terminus> yeah, i'm digging through the api docs right now.
[15:49:40] <Terminus> cjohnson: i may have neglected to look at just plain jquery and went straight to jquery ui.
[15:49:57] <Terminus> doug64k: what i've got so far -> http://jsfiddle.net/oc3fcs4u/
[15:51:54] <Terminus> the idea is '.menu-out' slides out on hover to reveal '.menu-in'. unless there's a better way of doing this rather than have two copies of the same menu...
[15:59:00] <Terminus> oh crap. i feel stupid. i didn't add jquery ui to the fiddle. >_<
[16:00:00] <doug64k> Terminus: super simple slide http://www.jstraight.com/1171/1
[16:00:57] <Terminus> doug64k: thanks. i figured out the confusion with jsfiddle though. i only selected jquery, no jquery ui. >_<
[16:05:07] <guideX> hey, what's a good textbox autocomplete? (not chosen)
[16:05:52] <doug64k> guideX: the jquery ui one is ok
[16:06:14] <doug64k> if you dont want piles of bells and wistles (you dont)
[16:06:34] <guideX> ag, the jquery ui one requires a heap of files though..
[16:06:39] <guideX> looking for something slimer
[16:06:57] <guideX> cause when you commit to jquery ui, it breaks other ui stuff, and then I can't remove it
[16:07:17] <doug64k> yeah that is bad
[16:07:19] <guideX> it's like a bundled thingy, historically always a poor choice because of how it comes with so much
[16:07:22] <Terminus> ok, next problem. jquery seems to be setting display: none when toggling causing my menu elements to shift to the left. how do i stop it from doing that? -> http://jsfiddle.net/oc3fcs4u/4/
[16:07:30] <doug64k> typeahead.js is an old favorite
[16:07:46] <guideX> oh hmm, typeahead eh? i'll check it
[16:08:06] <doug64k> a lot of them have a lot of overhead though
[16:08:59] <doug64k> guideX: this one claims to be really lightweight http://plugins.jquery.com/remote-list/
[16:09:04] <doug64k> that seems important to you
[16:10:06] <guideX> doug64k: ah kind of, jusrt don't like jquery ui heh
[16:10:20] <guideX> but yeah, i'l check this out too thanks
[16:10:22] <doug64k> me either, it's too much
[16:10:45] <Oka> Terminus: This effect you're going for, with the sliding down, could be achieved with CSS3 and pseudo elements.
[16:10:47] <guideX> oh this is perfect..
[16:11:00] <guideX> remotelist is the one, thanks
[16:12:12] <Terminus> Oka: oh goddamnit. time to get myself up to date with css3.
[16:12:37] <Oka> Terminus: I'll build you an example, but using JS and jquery for this effect is overkill
[16:14:07] <Terminus> Oka: yeah, i'm still stuck with stuff from years ago where i assume that keeping it to css2 gives me the best chance for compatibility. XD
[16:14:30] <Terminus> Oka: thanks. i'm googling stuff about it too.
[16:14:51] <doug64k> css3 is old by now
[16:16:53] <Terminus> doug64k: vendor prefixes still give me the impression that it's not quite stable though.
[16:18:37] <doug64k> being standardized doesnt give you any more guarantee of existing and being implemented
[16:18:56] <doug64k> if they said ok no more prefix on that one... you would keep using it anyway for legacy people
[16:22:25] <guideX> anyone used jquery remotelist and know how to feed it information instead of providing a remote json file?
[16:22:28] <Terminus> doug64k: i'm currently just focusing on the latest versions of each major browser. i'm thinking of pretty much just using anything without a vendor prefix. using something with a vendor prefix makes me think it will turn into unmaintainable gunk eventually.
[16:22:40] <guideX> what if I want to provide json via the web app, instead of a file..
[16:24:43] <Oka> Terminus: http://codepen.io/Oka/pen/NPPgVm/ Going for this effect, yes?
[16:26:39] <Terminus> Oka: yep! thanks a lot!
[16:26:45] <guideX> oh wait, got it :)
[16:27:07] <Terminus> Oka: that is so much cleaner on the html side too.
[16:33:25] <doug64k> Terminus: real web apps will have a build process where an automated tool adds the required prefixes
[16:34:06] <doug64k> it just gets you closer to "always works"
[16:35:18] <Terminus> doug64k: maybe i'll get to it some day. i'm already skipping using stuff like sass.
[16:35:22] <doug64k> what would happen if the browser didnt support it? it would do the change quickly. that isnt so bad
[16:36:06] <doug64k> if the browser doesnt support that it is probably a bit laughable anyway and nobody will mind if there isnt a cool smooth slideout
[16:36:33] <doug64k> and forcing a crap browser to do a smooth animation probably isnt a path to an app that always works
[16:37:37] <Terminus> doug64k: i agree with you there which is why i don't care about getting things running in anything but the latest browsers.
[17:50:30] <d4rklit3> hi
[17:50:36] <d4rklit3> im trying to use jquery validate
[17:50:45] <d4rklit3> so i set up my hidden inputs to be required
[17:50:52] <d4rklit3> then $('form').validate()
[17:51:07] <d4rklit3> i wantto check the rules $('form').rules(), and i get TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined
[17:52:30] <d4rklit3> .valid() is always true also
[17:54:29] <Ansikt> what's the output of: $('form').length
[17:56:54] <d4rklit3> .. 1
[17:56:57] <d4rklit3> there is a form
[17:57:14] <d4rklit3> if i select an element in the form
[17:57:21] <d4rklit3> $("#age").rules()
[17:57:24] <d4rklit3> i get the rules...
[17:57:30] <d4rklit3> so #age is requried
[17:57:33] <d4rklit3> it has no value right now
[17:57:41] <d4rklit3> $("#age").valid() //true
[17:58:22] <Ansikt> Not familiar with that plugin, but just my $0.02 -
[17:59:41] <Ansikt> nodeType is the property which gives the tagname of a DOM element.  If that's trying to read off of undefined, then that means the plugin or jQuery is expecting a DOM collection where there in fact is none.
[18:00:47] <Ansikt> If I were you, I'd read my way up the stack trace and see where that check is actually being made in the plugin.
[18:01:20] <Ansikt> do they filter the inputs to .is(":visible"), perhaps?
[18:31:21] <ReScO> hello
[18:31:25] <ReScO> how can i replace the contents of the page without browsing?
[18:31:55] <ReScO> just use .show and .hide ?
[18:32:32] <beefKitten> resco: or depending on what you're trying to do .html()
[18:34:26] <ReScO> http://vision.api1.nl/ this is the page, i want to replace the contents of the body so to speak depending on the url hash (#home / #login / #register )
[18:36:06] <ReScO> What's my best option?
[18:36:42] <beefKitten> ReScO: Are you only using jQuery?
[18:36:44] <ReScO> I've seen where pages slide out and in from right to left and stuff
[18:36:49] <ReScO> jQuery + Bootstrap
[18:36:51] <Ansikt> Resco - A simple way would be:
[18:39:41] <Ansikt> Let's say your main element is .container
[18:40:08] <Ansikt> and you have links which point to html fragment endpoints
[18:41:10] <ReScO> how about ordering the pages by making different .containers, move them to either left or right depending on link hierarchy?
[18:41:34] <ReScO> margin-left: -5000 or 5000 right?
[18:41:47] <ReScO> and .hide()
[18:42:22] <Ansikt> var $container = $('.container'); $container.on('click', 'a', function(e){ e.preventDefault();$container.load($(this).prop('href')); });
[18:43:08] <ReScO> e.preventDefault() is to disable normal link behaviour?
[18:43:11] <Ansikt> ^ That should allow you to request html fragment content from the server without page loads
[18:43:13] <Ansikt> yeah
[18:43:39] <Ansikt> so basically, we override all the links in .container to point to ajax endpoints instead of places to navigate to
[18:43:46] <ReScO> can't i just hide or show divs depending on display:hidden?
[18:43:52] <ReScO> and move them off screen?
[18:44:01] <Ansikt> Sure.
[18:44:16] <Ansikt> A couple notes though -
[18:44:57] <ReScO> I'm always open for discussion :P
[18:45:13] <Ansikt> If I were you, I'd check for css transform support, then transform:translateX() instead of using left / right values
[18:45:23] <ReScO> why that?
[18:45:48] <Ansikt> Because using CSS transitions with css transforms is much more performant
[18:45:56] <Ansikt> than using left / right
[18:46:22] <Ansikt> (you can still $.fn.animate for old browsers, though...there's a jQuery.transit plugin which does this for you if you're interested)
[18:46:55] <ReScO> so they changed how to do stuff?
[18:47:00] <ReScO> new methods?
[18:47:11] <ReScO> or just a more compliant method?
[18:47:29] <Ansikt> Basically, the reasoning is that the browser stores 'layers' of your web page in memory as images, and it can move these images around very fast, but creating new images takes a long time
[18:47:45] <Ansikt> CSS transforms just move those images around, whereas left / right create new ones.
[18:48:02] <ReScO> so it's better performance wise?
[18:48:49] <Ansikt> Yeah.  You don't have to use jQuery.transit, but you should prefer CSS transforms + CSS transitions over jQuery.animate of left / right
[18:49:33] <Ansikt> Incidentally, this is why browser animations are sometimes slow and choppy, but you can usually scroll smoothly
[18:50:00] <ReScO> funny
[18:50:18] <ReScO> But, back to the point
[18:50:35] <ReScO> Do you have any tutorials on how to implement this properly?
[18:50:56] <Ansikt> Not really.  If you're not doing ajax stuff, it's largely pretty simple
[18:51:13] <ReScO> Because I want a few things, the register screen is an overlay that animates in from the bottom, the login page is one page over to the right.
[18:51:29] <ReScO> that's basically all i want
[18:51:44] <ReScO> The page where you end up when you're logged in is way easier
[18:52:00] <ReScO> And i can manage that pretty well as far as i know
[18:52:31] <Ansikt> Have an overflow:hidden; element for the main thing, then for the login / register screens, give them the following in css:
[18:52:32] <ReScO> Basically missing some knowledge here on how to properly move things around with jQuery
[18:55:41] <Ansikt> .login-container, .register-container { position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;transition:transform 0.5 easeOut; } .login-container { transform:translate(100%, 0); } .register-container { transform:translate(0, 100%); } .login-container.active, .register-container.active { transform:translate(0,0); }
[18:55:56] <Ansikt> then just toggle 'active' classes with jQuery
[18:56:48] <ReScO> .login-container, .register-container { position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;transition:transform 0.5 easeOut; } .login-container { transform:translate(100%, 0); } .register-container { transform:translate(0,
[18:56:48] <Ansikt> You of course also need browser prefixes, and you should have a fallback for old browsers, but... this should be most of it
[18:56:57] <ReScO> shite
[18:57:25] <Ansikt> Oh, hey, the whole thing didn't display
[18:58:21] <ReScO> yeah it did
[18:58:27] <Ansikt> Oh, yeah
[18:58:27] <ReScO> just over two lines
[18:58:35] <Ansikt> let me throw together a fiddle...
[18:58:36] <ReScO> i'm using irssi in a putty term
[18:58:43] <Ansikt> dear god
[18:58:46] <ReScO> right click pastes :P
[18:59:02] <ReScO> it's basically an always online thing running in a screen
[19:08:27] <Ansikt> ReScO, http://jsfiddle.net/qkqonnu9/1/
[19:15:25] <kinesis> I use wordpress RatingWidget and Masonry.js layout.. Something about those 5star rating plugins loading on all my posts causes the masonry divs to overlap. Why is it that imagesReady nor $(window).load nor $(document).ready handles these events?
[19:16:01] <kinesis> I tried msnry.layout() under a few techniques, but I can't get it to launch as those stars launch.
[19:17:04] <kinesis> I even copied lines of code called a Mutation Event monitor
[19:17:10] <kinesis> That did nothing.. for .each()
[19:17:25] <Ansikt> kinesis, Not familiar with those plugins.  Can you post some code / a live example?
[19:18:03] <kinesis> Due to the nature of this plugin, I doubt it.. It pulls via AJAX and such
[19:19:32] <kinesis> Oh yeah I remember this ...  We can't get past it if there is no Fiddle ..
[19:20:20] <Ansikt> Well, someone who knows these plugins might know more
[19:20:46] <kinesis> Yeah it is reallly hard to reproduce this
[19:20:55] <kinesis> Lots of JS and a lot of div layout
[19:21:24] <Ansikt> and the problem likely lies in your implementation, so it's hard to know without code.
[19:51:53] <Shoxter> Does anybody have any experience using jQuery UI with Ember CLI?
[19:53:14] <julian``> hey can someone have a look at this please: http://jsfiddle.net/wnopdg9p/ press accomodation and it slides down but it wont slide up not too sure why
[19:54:02] <julian``> navBar isnt getting changed to closed
[19:58:05] <Shoxter> Anyone have experience with using Ember CLI and jQuery UI? After properly installing, importing, and implementing, the browser inspector isn't recognizing tooltip() as being defined despite UI being in my vendor.js file.
[19:58:41] <shebbi> julian``: var navBar = "closed"; <-- this will make it "always closed"
[19:59:49] <shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/wnopdg9p/1/
[20:00:21] <julian``> oh yeah derp
[20:00:29] <julian``> thanks haha 4am
[20:09:21] <Shoxter> Anyone have experience with using Ember CLI and jQuery UI? After properly installing, importing, and implementing, the browser inspector isn't recognizing tooltip() as being defined despite UI being in my vendor.js file.
[20:43:49] <DavisV> Hey guys, I was in here earlier for some help with my jquery code here: http://jsfiddle.net/h6xkow4s/4/ The code works fine in jsfiddle, but when I upload it to my site, the character remaining count displays NaN. I used console.log to look at the variable values and noticed that until I click into the textarea and either backspace or add a space, the maxlength variable is undefined.
[20:44:04] <DavisV> How do I fix that? Thanks in advance

[20:57:21] <Oka> DavisV: Can you provide a live example of your website
[21:00:08] <DavisV> I don't think I can since the site is on my computer (it's just a work in progress), but I decided to set maxLength as a global variable and give it a value of 160. Turns out that the jquery code is applied to all textarea fields instead of just one XD Is there any way to limit it to just one textarea field?
[21:00:35] <DavisV> I'm guessing fixing that problem would in turn fix my original problem
[21:00:37] <Oka> give it an ID and do $('textarea#ID')
[21:00:43] <DavisV> Oh okay cool
[21:01:13] <Oka> But yeah, it's a little hard to debug working code looking for an error that exists in a different environment !
[21:04:31] <DavisV> Oka: Thank you - t was it! Fixed both problems. Woooo
[21:04:34] <DavisV> that*
[22:24:51] <hyperair> is there a flot channel around?
[22:26:05] <hyperair> oh looks like there's #flot, just empty and with broken links in the topic
[23:19:07] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:23:32] <miCSu> Shouldn't $("<span/>").text($("input").val()).html() convert " -> &quot; etc?
[23:24:01] <Cork> yes
[23:25:53] <Cork> miCSu: also please don't ask question with double negatives...
[23:28:15] <miCSu> Cork: ok, sorry but where's the second negative there?
[23:28:33] <Cork> miCSu: is it "yes" it shoulden't or "yes" it should?
[23:28:58] <Cork> your problem :)
[23:31:35] <miCSu> right, next time I'll think before asking the question ^^ Was quite sure about the meaning before, now not quite.
[23:32:02] <Cork> :)
[23:32:07] <Cork> i'll be nice
[23:32:26] <Cork> yes .text() should take the input as how it should be shown in the dom
[23:32:40] <Cork> so all entities that need to be escaped should be escaped
