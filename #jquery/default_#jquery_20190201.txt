[11:44:41] <brandonc> Hi everybody. Can I use jQuery to import data from an Excel sheet and make variables out of them?
[11:45:01] <brandonc> I don't want to just display the data I want to do things to it to customize how it's displayed
[11:45:03] <bestdesign> i think so
[11:45:07] <bestdesign> but i am newbie too
[11:45:25] <bestdesign> too display use CSS how it looks
[11:47:40] <brandonc> I'm trying to use one table of data to make three different displays of the information in a different way
[11:51:01] <bestdesign> i am not a pro :D  so do it as you can
[11:51:11] <bestdesign> if you have any problem make a jsfiddle
[16:45:25] <bkcpro> https://pastebin.com/0PjHE12E ; in the description of parameter "end", what does first element and last element mean?
[16:45:57] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing this?
[16:46:02] <robertmaxrees> from the api docs?
[16:46:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[16:47:05] <robertmaxrees> "first" means the 0th element in the jquery object, and "last" means the length - 1 element in the jquery object.

[16:49:08] <youngjo> hi
[16:49:31] <youngjo> when im doing an .ajax then .complete(function (rsp) {
[16:49:39] <bkcpro> I did check the documentation in the website you mentioned. I'm just wondering why does it say, the zero-based index of the first element "not to be included". Because when we use slice, the element in the first parameter is included, and the second parameter excluded?
[16:49:40] <youngjo> im having to do rsp = JSON.parse(rsp.responseText)
[16:49:47] <youngjo> is there any way to automate that?
[16:50:16] <robertmaxrees> youngjo can you share your entire ajax call in a fiddle?
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> bkcpro huh?
[16:51:09] <youngjo> https://jsfiddle.net/4ufr5ado/
[16:51:15] <robertmaxrees> i don;'t see "not to be included" anywhere in the docs...
[16:51:56] <robertmaxrees> youngjo i mean, you're getting JSON back sooo :)
[16:52:35] <youngjo> so the json.parse is unneccesary? i think i tried that..
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> it is necessary
[16:53:00] <youngjo> ok
[16:53:28] <youngjo> i like how ive done it i just dont like having to include the  rsp = JSON.parse(rsp.responseText) line every time :D
[16:53:44] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you need to include let or const or var in front of that btw.
[16:53:59] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jQuery are you using?
[16:54:22] <youngjo> 3.1.0
[16:54:34] <robertmaxrees> use .then() instead of .complete().
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> and .catch() instead of :error
[16:54:42] <robertmaxrees> *error:
[16:55:11] <youngjo> ok
[16:55:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:55:21] <youngjo> just for best practice? or will that help me shorten it..
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> you're using deprecated stuff.
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> surprised they're still working for you - complete was removed in 3.x.  you using the migrate plugin?
[16:57:20] <youngjo> oh, looks like v1.9.1 is included after 3.1.0
[16:57:27] <robertmaxrees> :|
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> so you're not using 3.1
[16:57:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:57:35] <youngjo> right
[16:57:40] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[16:58:34] <robertmaxrees> bkcpro so what're you asking?
[17:00:13] <bkcpro> I was wondering what first element and last element meant, in the link that I posted https://pastebin.com/0PjHE12E. It's from jQuery in action slice() description
[17:00:30] <robertmaxrees> so jquery objects can contain multiple elements.
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> often in the order they're found in the Document.
[17:01:13] <robertmaxrees> so "first" and "last" are references to the first and last object in the jquery object.
[17:02:18] <bkcpro> robertmaxrees got it, thanks!

[17:02:25] <robertmaxrees> for a simplified example.
[18:53:33] <Starship8015> hi :) how can i select all div where id contains "step" but not the one with step1
[18:54:03] <Starship8015> $("div").not("#step" + step).hide(); this is what i have so far
[18:54:11] <Starship8015> while variable step = 1
[18:55:51] <taplar> id*=step should get you the ones that contain step
[18:55:51] <taplar> id^=step the ones that start with step
[18:55:51] <taplar> personally i'd throw a class of 'step' on them, select by the class, then filter on the id
[18:56:00] <Starship8015> $('div[id^="step"]').not("#step" + step).hide();
[18:56:04] <Starship8015> that seems to work :) alright
[18:56:28] <taplar> yep, just keep in mind that attribute selectors are not the most performant, so scope them down, or take a think on my previous suggestion
[18:56:59] <Starship8015> got it
