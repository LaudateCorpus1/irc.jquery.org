[00:00:00] <Cork> Verzlo: you're site has a ton of problems
[00:00:12] <Verzlo> Im only doing one little thing for it
[00:00:20] <Verzlo> I didnt do th rest of it
[00:00:32] <Cork> ya, and that is prob why it's in such an horrible state
[00:00:36] <Valduare> I got bootstrap 3 here. popovers   how can I capture a click in body to close the popover  instead of having to click back on the initial element
[00:00:41] <Cork> noone does more then extending there little thing
[00:00:42] <Verzlo> Eh
[00:00:46] <Verzlo> Ill tell somebody
[00:00:51] <Verzlo> I do
[00:00:56] <Verzlo> I do what im told to fix
[00:01:21] <Cork> the setInterval is a red herring for me
[00:01:36] <Verzlo> I know there are better ways
[00:01:43] <Cork> it usually is a good indication that someone created something with the mentality of "just make it works"
[00:01:46] <Cork> -s
[00:01:58] <Verzlo> Anyways..
[00:02:02] <Cork> its not that other are "better" its that the solution at hand is horrible
[00:02:02] <Verzlo> I will pass your information on
[00:06:46] <ivanjaeem> hi all
[00:06:50] <ivanjaeem> good day
[00:07:08] <Woet> gud day 2 u 2
[00:09:46] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[00:09:46] <negusnegesti> Is anyone here experienced with JS Ext?
[00:09:46] <negusnegesti> I'd like to close an open tab, added to the panel by Panel.add(). In my case: Ext.getCmp('CenterPanel').add(progForm2);
[00:09:46] <negusnegesti> How can I close it again? Thx in advance!
[00:09:59] <Cork> negusnegesti: offtopic
[00:10:02] <Cork> ask in there channel
[00:10:13] <negusnegesti> ah ok
[01:56:03] <DragonPunch> Okay, so I'm making an AJAX request to 'append' some data to my news feed. For some reason, whenever I make a post to my news feed and it gets appended to someones news feed on (a diff screen). It's removing the text that was typed into the message box. Why is this happening.. I'm stumped.
[01:56:50] <Cork> DragonPunch: you most likely convert the dom to html do modifications and then inject the new html
[01:57:05] <Cork> this creates new elements, so what ever state the old elements was in is lost
[01:57:15] <krambiorix> in my code i have if( breadcrumbids === undefined){  -> but on that line i get an error "ReferenceError: breadcrumbids is not defined".... What can i do?
[01:57:35] <Cork> krambiorix: undefined only works on properties
[01:57:41] <Cork> you have to use typeof for variables
[01:57:52] <DragonPunch> Cork: hmm....yeah but why does this happen to other 'users' logged in different browsers?
[01:58:07] <DragonPunch> Cork: it should only be appending the data into a div.
[01:58:24] <Cork> DragonPunch: most likely cause you replace the dom elements even if there is no change
[01:58:25] <krambiorix> Cork, ow thanks!
[01:58:27] <DragonPunch> Cork: btw these are contentEditables.
[01:58:32] <Cork> ah
[01:58:41] <Cork> DragonPunch: content editable is... special
[01:58:52] <DragonPunch> Speical in many ways.
[01:59:01] <Cork> you should be careful around them
[01:59:15] <DragonPunch> : /
[02:00:13] <DragonPunch> Cork: want to see a live example?
[02:00:47] <Cork> i could take a quick look, but i'm not promising anything
[02:00:54] <Cork> content editable can be tricky to get right
[02:06:32] <DragonPunch> Cork: Okay so. Open 2 browsers. On one browser go to scribear.com/test and on the other go to scribear.com/test2 then go to scribear.com on both and you should be logged in.
[02:07:21] <DragonPunch> Cork: From there, you can just hit the 'Scribe' button on one of the screens and you should see  the content on the other screen disappear after it is added via append. :|
[02:07:43] <Cork> ReferenceError: rgba is not defined test:9
[02:10:18] <DragonPunch> Cork: Was it able to load?
[02:10:25] <DragonPunch> Cork: refresh?
[02:10:42] <Cork> same
[02:10:46] <DragonPunch> The hell.
[02:11:38] <DragonPunch> Cork: Try now.
[02:11:54] <Cork> same
[02:12:08] <DragonPunch> Can you send me Screenshot?
[02:12:15] <Cork> i gave you the error code
[02:12:38] <Cork> rgba(207,207,207,0.1);<--
[02:12:48] <DragonPunch> Oh
[02:12:50] <DragonPunch> I see it
[02:12:59] <Cork> anyway i don't have time for this
[02:13:37] <DragonPunch> Cork: I fixed it.
[02:13:40] <DragonPunch> Cork: try now.
[02:14:57] <DragonPunch> Cork: you try? or do you have to go.
[02:15:11] <Cork> i said i could make a quick test
[02:15:27] <Cork> i can't spend endless time debugging why it isn't loading at all
[02:16:24] <DragonPunch> Cork: Yah mbad. It's fine.
[02:45:49] <xochilpili> hi all
[02:46:08] <xochilpili> hi all, i have a question; i have a button that when i re-created it doesnt work at $('btn').on('click', function(e){}); method, is there a way to fix it?
[02:47:06] <marcusdei> hi all
[02:47:08] <marcusdei> this site: http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[02:47:17] <marcusdei> The first offer Berlin
[02:47:30] <marcusdei> you will notice that the picture itself links to a page
[02:47:39] <marcusdei> and the text area links to #
[02:48:01] <marcusdei> I would like the href of the picture to replace the # href
[02:48:06] <marcusdei> is that possible with jQuery ?
[02:56:59] <tuskkk___> How to check if the data returned on the success of an ajax call is empty?
[02:57:07] <Cork> xochilpili: use delegated event listener
[02:57:11] <Cork> ?api delegate
[02:57:11] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:57:18] <Cork> xochilpili: read that page ^
[02:57:30] <xochilpili> Cork, i solved it, thank you
[02:57:57] <xochilpili>  $(document).on('click','selector',function(e){ // do the thing... });
[02:58:04] <Cork> tuskkk___: data.length == 0 ?
[02:58:22] <Cork> xochilpili: if possible bind it on a closer static parent
[02:58:30] <tuskkk___> Cork: ok, I was about to try if(!data)
[02:58:53] <Cork> tuskkk___: that just checks if the value is truthy
[02:59:05] <tuskkk___> ok
[02:59:13] <Cork> so ex " " would be "not empty"
[02:59:44] <marcusdei> ok so here is the fiddle
[02:59:46] <marcusdei> http://jsfiddle.net/t2sav3c4/4/
[03:00:25] <Cork> marcusdei: you want to replace the content of the href on page load or what?
[03:00:38] <Cork> else you could just as well just remove the <a> tag all together
[03:00:57] <Cork> (also why not just solve this server side?)
[03:01:18] <marcusdei> yes
[03:01:21] <marcusdei> there are two hrefs
[03:01:34] <marcusdei> the second needs to assume the href of the first
[03:01:35] <tuskkk___> Cork: data.length is coming out 1 even when there is empty response
[03:01:46] <marcusdei> hold on, I'm going to see if this is fixable in the CMS
[03:02:07] <Cork> tuskkk___: no one click action needs to fake click on the other link
[03:02:18] <Cork> tuskkk___: there is no need for the second broken link tag to be there
[03:02:24] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[03:02:28] <Cork> marcusdei: ^
[03:02:30] <tuskkk___> yes
[03:02:51] <Cork> tuskkk___: yes, length gives you the length of the string
[03:03:13] <Cork> you would have to do some more advanced checking if you want to know what is in there
[03:03:17] <tuskkk___> maybe I should put this check in the controller
[03:03:29] <tuskkk___> or in the view that is coming using ajax
[03:03:47] <Cork> you could send json, and just set the key if the value isn't empty
[03:03:51] <Cork> so you get {}
[03:04:00] <Cork> { "response": "html"}
[03:04:10] <Cork> (the former is when there is no data)
[03:04:12] <marcusdei> ok, so the second href is removed
[03:04:31] <marcusdei> but i still need that text to assume the href of the image
[03:04:56] <Cork> marcusdei: just so we don't over work this
[03:04:59] <marcusdei> so basically, the closing </a>
[03:05:00] <Cork> why not just extend the a tag?
[03:05:11] <tuskkk___> Cork: but then can I send html from the controller? will have to make is json right?
[03:05:12] <marcusdei> needs to come at the end of the whole OFFER
[03:05:14] <Cork> so it includes all the area you want clickable
[03:05:34] <Cork> tuskkk___: yes, but that is just a response header away :)
[03:05:59] <tuskkk___> Ok, let me try doing that
[03:06:09] <marcusdei> is it possible to hear a sound if someone calls my name on mirc?
[03:06:28] <Cork> marcusdei: sure, check the highlight settings
[03:07:32] <Cork> hmm or did you have to script that in mirc...?
[03:07:50] <Cork> man i have started to forget mirc :/ kinda saddening
[03:10:22] <marcusdei> can someone call my name?
[03:10:28] <marcusdei> so can test sound?
[03:10:34] <arunce> marcusdei:
[03:10:38] <marcusdei> nuttin
[03:11:09] <Cork> marcusdei: i think you need to install a script for highlighting in mirc
[03:11:20] <marcusdei> ok try now pls
[03:11:30] <Cork> that said, better of asking that in there forums (i don't think they have an irc channel)
[03:11:55] <marcusdei> say ma name!
[03:12:00] <marcusdei> niauwwww
[03:12:57] <Cork> ah, nope
[03:13:12] <Cork> highlight should definitely be able to do it
[03:13:18] <marcusdei> ok call ma name pls
[03:13:26] <marcusdei> so can test
[03:13:41] <Cork> marcusdei: open a second connection and test you're self (in a private channel)
[03:13:54] <marcusdei> it works
[03:13:55] <marcusdei> ty
[03:14:13] <marcusdei> ok
[03:14:26] <marcusdei> so please check the first offer on this page
[03:14:30] <marcusdei> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[03:14:33] <marcusdei> The Berlin offer
[03:15:01] <marcusdei> I removed the href on the text area of the offer
[03:15:22] <marcusdei> but now I want to wrap it in an href and assume the href of the image
[03:15:28] <marcusdei> any ideaS?
[03:17:17] <Cork> marcusdei: i asked a question about that before
[03:17:36] <Cork> <Cork> marcusdei: just so we don't over work this | <Cork> why not just extend the a tag?
[03:17:37] <marcusdei> ah let me see
[03:17:57] <Cork> opps "<Cork> so it includes all the area you want clickable"
[03:18:04] <marcusdei> yes
[03:18:17] <Cork> that is by far the best solution, as it works even without js
[03:18:38] <marcusdei> yes, the offers were made poorly from the beginning
[03:18:47] <marcusdei> so now i ened a scripty workaround you see
[03:18:50] <Cork> there are some situations where js is needed (clickable table rows) but most of the times you should avoid it
[03:19:05] <Cork> marcusdei: why not just fix it server side?
[03:19:19] <marcusdei> Cork: but how?
[03:19:41] <marcusdei> can we not just move the closing </a> somehow?
[03:19:42] <Cork> well... kinda hard to say without knowing what you have
[03:19:52] <Cork> sure you can
[03:20:00] <Cork> there are plenty of ways to do that
[03:20:05] <Cork> sed for one :)
[03:21:04] <Cork> the best part is that if you fix the source error, you only have to fix it once, not every time someone renders it
[03:22:59] <marcusdei> yes
[03:23:07] <marcusdei> the source of the error is the CMS
[03:23:17] <marcusdei> the way those offer blocks have been ptu together
[03:23:19] <marcusdei> put
[03:23:33] <marcusdei> and it's tedious to go redo them all now
[03:23:48] <Cork> well it is by a large margin the better option
[03:23:50] <marcusdei> well, the customer, they want to be able to change the image easily you see
[03:23:54] <marcusdei> and the href of the image
[03:24:01] <Cork> sure you could select the elements and append them inside the a tag
[03:24:12] <Cork> but 1. it will mean things break without js for no good reason
[03:24:25] <Cork> 2. it also means things will have to jitter around as it will render twice
[03:24:34] <marcusdei> understood
[03:24:36] <Cork> 3. it also means the page will load slower cause you get double rendering
[03:24:44] <marcusdei> indeed
[03:24:50] <marcusdei> :\
[03:25:06] <marcusdei> just trying to think what is best
[03:25:19] <marcusdei> because if the customer has to add the url twice
[03:25:21] <marcusdei> once for the image
[03:25:28] <marcusdei> and once for the second part of the offer..
[03:25:30] <Cork> the absolutely best solution is to fix the source
[03:25:31] <marcusdei> tedious you see
[03:25:44] <Cork> not really
[03:25:46] <Cork> it can be scripted
[03:26:08] <marcusdei> can we not just script it as such, that the first href, is push to the second empty href?
[03:26:17] <marcusdei> please enlighten, i go to toilet
[03:26:24] <Cork> brb
[03:30:17] <marcusdei> brb
[03:30:23] <marcusdei> helping a colleague
[04:31:31] <marcusdei> I'm baaaaack ;)
[04:31:48] <marcusdei> Cork: are you here?
[04:58:48] <jop008> I have a select and I can select multiple items but I don't have multiple option in my select
[04:59:02] <jop008> how to make it select singe?
[05:10:09] <DERIIIFranz> working with jquery.maskedInput (https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput):  is it possible to listen on an event, when a user changes the value from _completed_ to not-completed? (or kind of)
[05:11:12] <DERIIIFranz> in other words: I want to listen to an invalid input
[05:14:09] <DERIIIFranz_> working with jquery.maskedInput (https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput):  is it possible to listen on an event, triggered by an invalid input?
[05:15:48] <Cork> DERIIIFranz_: from skimming the source, no doesn't look like it
[05:15:53] <Cork> https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput/blob/master/src/jquery.maskedinput.js
[05:17:29] <DERIIIFranz_> do you know a similar plugin that might is capable in doing so?
[05:17:35] <Cork> nope
[05:17:46] <Cork> never seen this one either
[05:18:12] <DERIIIFranz_> ok, thx
[05:24:18] <DERIIIFranz_> or is it possible to add another change-listener to the input-field instead?
[05:24:26] <Cork> sure
[05:25:10] <DERIIIFranz_> somehow it isn't recognized and I thought, that this plugin would somehow prevent that
[05:25:24] <DERIIIFranz_> I mean my changehandler
[05:26:16] <Cork> nope the plugin is written correctly in that regard
[05:26:18] <DERIIIFranz_> adding the changehandler as an attribute onChange
[05:26:23] <Cork> it doesn't kill the event it doesn't want
[05:26:28] <DERIIIFranz_> alright
[05:26:34] <Cork> you don't add attributes for events
[05:26:39] <Cork> you add event handlers
[05:26:42] <Cork> ?api on
[05:26:42] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:27:30] <DERIIIFranz_> yes, but what about <input type="text" onChange=function(){dosomething} />
[05:27:49] <Cork> no, like i said, set an event handler
[05:28:01] <Cork> event attributes are a legacy feature
[05:28:11] <Cork> it doesn't work well with dom events and you should avoid them
[05:28:29] <Cork> (event attribute is dom0, and is kept for backwards compatibility)
[05:28:38] <DERIIIFranz_> I see, thank you!
[05:29:17] <Cork> also, the reason event attributes doesn't work well with event listeners, isn't cause of event listeners, its cause event attributes are a broken concept
[05:29:33] <DERIIIFranz_> a broken concept?
[05:42:47] <JamesMcGill> hi just wondering whether you can restrict available days that are selectable by Jquery UI Date Picker as well as restrict the date range that is selectable ? I've tried usign $("#date").datepicker({ numberOfMonths: 3, minDate: start, end: end, beforeShowDay: function (date) { return [date.getDay() == 1, '']; } })
[05:42:49] <JamesMcGill> ?
[05:43:31] <toomus> Hi. How to detect, when screen is getting bigger and smaller with on('resize', ...)?
[05:46:06] <toomus> When window is resizing I want to call one function when it is getting bigger, and other function when it is getting smaller.
[05:47:33] <JamesMcGill> have you considered using a variable to hold the size of the window ? and using a function onresize to compare and then set the value ?
[05:47:45] <JamesMcGill> and then calling the respective function
[05:48:03] <JamesMcGill> toomus that was for you
[05:48:57] <toomus> You mean, I have to store current and prevoius size and compare everytime window resize?
[05:49:29] <Cork> toomus: you bind the event check the size and call the appropriate function
[05:50:05] <Cork> toomus: also consider checking if you can do this with @media css instead
[05:50:08] <JamesMcGill> Cork : his specifics were to check if it was smaller or bigger
[05:50:20] <Cork> as that normally results in much smoother experience
[05:50:52] <Cork> JamesMcGill: i know, and the answer was generic enough to match that
[05:51:24] <Cork> the point of the comment is that there isn't separate events for the direction of the resize
[05:52:10] <JamesMcGill> :D
[05:52:45] <Cork> toomus: if you absolutely have to use js there is the query interface (same syntax as @media)
[05:52:59] <Cork> and it provides callbacks you can use for when the rule matches or not
[05:53:13] <toomus> Cork: I need to hide/show overflow elements according to window size
[05:53:20] <Cork> its again better then resize events as it only fires a few times
[05:55:55] <JamesMcGill> toomus : Try bootstrap
[05:56:14] <JamesMcGill> makes your life a whole lot easier.
[05:56:23] <toomus> JamesMcGill: I have Semantic UI already :)
[05:57:05] <toomus> JamesMcGill: I think It can't be done just with responsive design
[05:58:32] <JamesMcGill> really I do it using bootstrap... there are classes to show for sepecific screen sizes.
[05:59:08] <toomus> So the only way to detect resize direction is to compare prevoius and current window size?
[05:59:31] <Cork> ?mdn media query
[05:59:31] <b-ot> Cork: CSS media queries - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[05:59:35] <Cork> bah
[05:59:39] <Cork> ?mdn media query javascript
[05:59:40] <b-ot> Cork: Window.matchMedia() - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[05:59:47] <Cork> toomus: check that one ^
[06:03:02] <toomus> Cork: looks great, but how to detect resize direction with it?
[06:05:06] <Cork> toomus: media queries is built around threshold values
[06:05:27] <Cork> toomus: not directions (cause then you are back to updating on each pixel the mouse moves)
[06:06:04] <Cork> toomus: if you really have to get pinged for every small step you need to use resize
[06:06:24] <Cork> toomus: but note, browser are working on making that event lazy (meaning they fire it when they get time)
[06:06:32] <Cork> and mobiles has done this for ever
[06:07:05] <Cork> so note that you won't get a 1-1 match to window movements
[06:15:09] <toomus> Cork: I know this may be not optimal solution to handle window resize with on('resize', ...) but I need It to be dynamic :/
[06:15:55] <Cork> toomus: ya, without knowing what you're trying to do ya, i've given you how so go for it
[06:18:07] <toomus> Cork: http://i59.tinypic.com/2zf7m1w.png
[06:19:55] <Cork> ok?
[06:20:52] <Cork> i see nothing in that picture telling me i need to catch resize to make things work
[06:21:01] <toomus> Cork: if window is getting bigger, items from list in the left should appear to fill free space
[06:21:16] <Cork> ok?
[06:21:46] <Cork> a table or flexbox should handle that just fine
[06:21:57] <toomus> Cork: In the left is lift of chat boxes which doesn't fit
[06:21:57] <Cork> (+ @media queries)
[06:30:59] <toomus> Cork: I think you still don't understand what I want to achievie. Every chat box in image has a width 200px. When window is resizing, and when there will be free 200px of space, first box from list of minimized windows should appear in this space.
[06:32:09] <Cork> toomus: sure, and that is perfectly doable without js
[06:32:19] <Cork> js needs to set hints for css, but js doens't need to do the updates
[06:32:22] <toomus> Cork: o0
[06:33:03] <Cork> what i mean is, js needs to for example set a class on a parent when it adds a new window
[06:33:11] <Cork> css is perfectly capable to do the rest
[06:33:41] <Cork> and actually modern css can possibly do the last part too, but you might end up with support problems in browsers you need to support
[06:34:33] <toomus> Cork: Interesting. I need to support only modern browsers, no IE.
[06:39:31] <Cork> toomus: then you could solve much of it with flexbox
[06:39:39] <Cork> possibly all of it
[06:40:40] <toomus> Cork: thx, I will check it :)
[07:25:28] <Es0teric> quick question -- how do i scroll to the bottom of a page? for some reason $("html, body").animate( { scrollTop: 0 }, 1000 ); is not working
[07:25:39] <Es0teric> its just constantly scrolling to the top
[07:31:21] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: scrollTop: 0 is the top of the page.
[07:31:31] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so then whats the bottom?
[07:31:33] <Es0teric> scrollBottom?
[07:31:42] <BillCriswell> You want to scroll to the bottom of the page.
[07:31:48] <BillCriswell> No, there's no scroll bottom.
[07:32:14] <Es0teric> ok so how do i scroll to the bottom?
[07:32:52] <BillCriswell> You'd scroll to document height minus the window height.
[07:33:21] <Es0teric> yeah that doesn't work for me either
[07:33:43] <BillCriswell> or if you have an element in particular you'd like to scroll to you can do like: scrollTop: $('#foo').offset().top
[07:33:51] <BillCriswell> It works.
[07:35:19] <Es0teric> BillCriswell the one with offset worked very well
[07:35:20] <Es0teric> thanks!
[07:35:28] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:36:44] <juro> hi, when using the on function, the event should trigger for injected elements as well, right?
[07:39:22] <BillCriswell> juro: Not necessarily. You need to use event delegation.
[07:40:03] <BillCriswell> juro: So you'd want to do like $('#static-element').on('click', '.new-element', function () { /* `this` will be `.new-element` */ });
[07:40:30] <juro> BillCriswell, I have stripped the example down to this: https://jsfiddle.net/t2z97xjc/
[07:41:09] <juro> when I hover over a tr element, I want the links to edit and delete to appear. Works great but not after clicking the reload button
[07:41:49] <BillCriswell> juro: Just use CSS for that (also, consider not doing that cause not everything has a mouse).
[07:42:41] <juro> BillCriswell, this is for a business admin backend, so they will have mouses but I agree that it might not be the best approach (but space is very limited for this :) )
[07:43:03] <BillCriswell> ok, then use CSS haha
[07:43:08] <juro> regarding the CSS comment, true - overengeineered this properly :D
[07:43:59] <BillCriswell> haha don't we all.
[07:44:43] <juro> BillCriswell, thank you for showing me the errors of my ways :D
[07:47:35] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:11:48] <Cobradabest> Hello, can somebody tell me how to stretch a foreground image to fit an entire screen , no matter what the window size or resolution?
[08:17:15] <Cobradabest> Nevermind, I figured it out, but the buttons on the page are still going in front of the foreground image, how do I stop that, and make it so that it ignores the foreground image when something is clicked?
[08:18:53] <samssh> Cobradabest, You can pass clicks through an element to those behind it. Instead, you should have the buttons in front of the image, and make them transparent.
[08:18:57] <samssh> *you can't
[08:19:14] <Cobradabest> Okay, how do I do that?
[08:19:34] <samssh> css: opacity: 0;
[08:19:39] <javalover> sooo I help my friend with code a lot, right now he wants one of those sites where you scroll down the page & new content shows up ya know cheezy template..was just curious if anyone has experience doing this...
[08:20:13] <javalover> it's those new style sites where you like scroll down & it's a new section...then scroll to a new section...
[08:20:20] <javalover> kinda like godaddys support page...
[08:20:26] <samssh> javalover, I don't have specific experience with it, but you can find lots of information on it by searching 'infinite scroll'
[08:20:40] <javalover> i know what infinite scroll is but like...
[08:20:52] <javalover> https://www.godaddy.com/
[08:20:58] <javalover> actually that's a great example, just scroll down...
[08:21:15] <javalover> he wants a layout like this...anyone know of a plugin or something for it?
[08:21:33] <Cobradabest> samssh: Okay, it works, thanks! How can I do the same with regular links? When I try a regular link, it goes behind the image, how do I make go in front, but slightly transparent?
[08:22:01] <samssh> javalover, That page doesn't infinitely scroll, and is a simple layout. Perhaps you meant a different link?
[08:22:14] <javalover> it doesn't have to infite scroll
[08:22:24] <javalover> it's like 5 sections that are laid out like godaddy is
[08:22:34] <javalover> it's not a news feed...it's just a basic thing
[08:23:07] <javalover> should I just make a normal layout that fills the page?
[08:23:15] <javalover> just trying to see if theres a plugin i've seen these a lot lately
[08:23:46] <Uhkis> you mean that slider?
[08:23:57] <javalover> just when you scroll down
[08:24:01] <javalover> like it's split up into sections
[08:24:08] <samssh> javalover, There isn't anything special about the markup, it just throws events at certain page scroll distances.
[08:24:20] <javalover> oh I know that i'm just asking
[08:24:26] <javalover> is there like some plugin other people are using...
[08:24:29] <samssh> I'm not sure.
[08:24:29] <javalover> just cuz i've seen this style a lot
[08:24:43] <javalover> theres another example where I saw it lets see
[08:24:58] <javalover> like here: http://chateaunights.com/
[08:25:19] <javalover> a lot of people are using this style layout
[08:25:30] <javalover> personally I hate it but this is what my friend wants lol
[08:26:32] <samssh> javalover, Have a look at #13 on this page: http://codegeekz.com/20-jquery-plugins-for-scrolling-effects/
[08:27:25] <javalover> oh these are nice
[08:27:30] <javalover> samssh thx :D
[08:27:42] <samssh> sure
[08:32:29] <Cobradabest> Does anyone know if it's possible to change what a button looks like in a jQuery mobile site? Or at least how to not make the buttons have round corners?
[08:38:51] <Orien> Helo, im trying to receive a msg from a sucess ajax call if i do .. success: function(data){ console.log(data); } its shows me all data .. if i do console.log(data.msg) says undifined ...  in console.log shows me this
[08:39:07] <Orien> {"msg":"Hello"}
[08:39:19] <Orien> why cant i access it doing data.msg ?
[08:39:19] <robertmaxrees> try console.log(typeof data);
[08:39:21] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[08:39:45] <Orien> string :(
[08:40:02] <robertmaxrees> so parse is - var myData = JSON.parse(data);
[08:40:06] <robertmaxrees> myData.msg
[08:42:53] <robertmaxrees> did that work, Orien?
[08:43:00] <Orien> testing
[08:44:12] <Orien> yaps it did :D
[08:44:19] <Orien> thank you robertmaxrees
[08:44:25] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[08:44:38] <Orien> didnt know about that typeof
[08:44:55] <Orien> it will help me alot
[08:45:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not as useful as you'd think.
[08:45:41] <robertmaxrees> like doing typeof []; returns "object"
[08:52:04] <Orien> but to parse data from php its usefull
[08:52:19] <robertmaxrees> JSON.parse() is the useful bit, in that case.
[08:52:20] <Orien> strange thing is that i have it working without parse in other webpage
[08:52:44] <robertmaxrees> that means you're shipping data differently in that case.
[08:52:46] <Orien> and now im thinking that page is wrong and always saying it is ok lol
[08:54:40] <robertmaxrees> you're using a JSON library to build up your json data, right
[08:56:50] <Orien> i dont think so robertmaxrees
[08:59:01] <robertmaxrees> you really should.
[08:59:14] <Orien2k> robertmaxrees sorry internet went offline
[08:59:24] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[08:59:30] <Orien2k> didnt read anything since i said "i dont think so robbyoconnor"
[08:59:39] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete ;)
[08:59:47] <robertmaxrees> and I said "you really should."
[09:02:45] <fred1807> This is my script that provides "artist" and "track" name to the html page, reading from a .json file.  http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CaTUuEiW       Now I want to hack it. On the json file there is Artist, Title AND file: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=kWLgqnpp  When a mp3 has no tags, artist and file are empty, but filename is always there. So how can I make it pass %file  as %title to the html, if %artist and %title are empty?
[09:09:51] <decx> .text(json.artist || json.file)
[09:17:12] <fred1807> decx:  http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=iSiHkqCZ   :/
[09:18:40] <decx> yes?
[09:47:00] <nezZario> If I do, e.x. $('.auto-title').trigger('change'); and 3 inputs have the auto-title class, is that going to trigger that function 3x ?
[09:49:33] <decx> yes
[09:55:27] <nezZario> decx, thanks, that makes sense, but just wanted to be sure
[09:57:34] <decx> what stopped you from testing it ^^
[10:07:28] <yacek19> hi
[10:08:53] <yacek19> I would like to select input:radio inside div, when this div is being clicked. However triggering input's click causes infinite loop
[10:09:05] <yacek19> could someone check it please http://jsfiddle.net/cxp3tfwd/
[10:09:41] <decx> use a label instead of a div and you dont need js
[10:10:37] <yacek19> decx: I am unfortunatelly extending some description for the field, so I need this div
[10:11:03] <decx> you can use label just like div
[10:13:01] <yacek19> and for educational purposes, how should I do it otherwise withous using click() on child element?
[10:13:58] <decx> e.stopImmediatePropagation()
[10:15:00] <yacek19> decx: it still executes infinitely
[10:17:05] <decx> you stop the propagation on the input not the div
[10:18:03] <yacek19> decx: ok thanks for help
[10:18:55] <decx> still, use a label that's what they are there for
[10:32:49] <fred1807> How can I change this:  if (data.artist !== $('#artist').text() || data.title !== $('#track').text())    To make it use data.file if data.artist is empty? (json has 'file')
[10:33:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:33:15] <fred1807> eli5
[10:33:15] <robertmaxrees> share more code.
[10:35:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8Lpp7637/
[10:35:34] <robertmaxrees> setup defaults instead.
[10:35:38] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: This the script. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CaTUuEiW    (that changecolors() trigger a change in html color if there is now data...)          But my music library has many songs without tags, So if data.artist if empty (not tags on mp3)  Would be better if script used data.file, and passed that to the html as "artist" , to fool the html and write the filename on screen.  Json has 'file", example http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=kWLgqnpp
[10:35:55] <decx> i gave the use of the || operator like 4 hours ago
[10:36:34] <decx> no idea what the conditionals against the text() is supposed to do though
[10:37:31] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to see if anything is changed so they know if they want to chanbge the color.
[10:37:48] <fred1807> ^
[10:38:01] <decx> i cant even imagine
[10:38:15] <decx> then again its hour 13 of work
[10:41:05] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 http://fixee.org/paste/xon3r9r/
[10:41:24] <robertmaxrees> err... http://fixee.org/paste/xon3r9r/#url=ved9ynr
[10:41:38] <Lencl> uhh
[10:43:12] <Lencl> in jquery mobile, I change the width for the left panel but when I click on the far right it exists the panel
[10:43:47] <robertmaxrees> "on the far right" of that panel?
[10:45:11] <Lencl> let's say the width was 50px before
[10:45:32] <Lencl> if I increase it to 100px... it works. But when I click anywhere after 50px in the panel.. it exists it
[10:45:37] <Lencl> it treats it as if it's not there
[10:45:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's a transparent div that gets overlayed that you need to modify, too.
[10:46:25] <Lencl> but I looked at the panel css and I couldn't find it?
[10:46:35] <robertmaxrees> it's not the panel, it's the transparent overlayt.
[10:46:40] <robertmaxrees> inspect with your dev tools.
[10:51:02] <Lencl> 76.79.253.139/~midev1/miwebsite
[10:51:09] <Lencl> I see the overlay
[10:51:22] <Lencl> but it's covering everything so technically it's supposed to be working?
[10:51:31] <Lencl> (this is regarding the left panel)
[10:51:32] <robertmaxrees> *(sigh
[10:51:54] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/idbpt5o.png
[10:51:56] <robertmaxrees> that isn't what you wnat.
[10:52:02] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[10:52:14] <Lencl> ohhh
[10:52:34] <Lencl> so it's not the overlay of the panel itself
[10:52:38] <Lencl> nvm
[10:52:42] <Lencl> I see what you mean
[10:52:43] <Lencl> thank you
[11:00:51] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: thx
[11:01:14] <kyrio> can anyone see any reason why this seems to do nothing: http://paste.lurkmore.com/vawunivijo.coffee
[11:01:24] <kyrio> trying to replace the src with data-swap so the image can be expanded inline
[11:03:33] <kyrio> preventdefault does work, nothing else happens
[11:04:16] <kyrio> oh damn, it seems i already fixed the script but preventdefault's location needed to be moved down
[11:04:25] <decx> how does preventdefault work if you don't have event in your function arg
[11:04:42] <robertmaxrees> it's bombing out on preventDefault(), so nothing else happens.
[11:04:55] <kyrio> yeah i moved it down and it is fine now robertmaxrees
[11:04:55] <kyrio> thanks
[11:05:00] <robertmaxrees> no...
[11:05:02] <robertmaxrees> it's erroring still.
[11:05:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bhnjproL/
[11:05:12] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[11:08:45] <Wes-> Is it expected that loading jquery.js could cause styling changes on my input tags?
[11:08:54] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't.
[11:09:32] <robertmaxrees> you might have another lib that relies on jquery that's firing up as a result.
[11:09:44] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: that's what I was thinking. It's what's happening - which means there must be something else doing it that doesn't happen when jquery do
[11:09:57] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: exactly. Now I have to puzzle out WHAT. :)
[11:10:07] <robertmaxrees> you mind sharing the page?
[11:10:08] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: thanks for the "jquery is clean" confirmation. I figured that was the case.
[11:10:12] <robertmaxrees> usually pretty easy to figure it out.
[11:11:00] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: Sure, http://wes.janus-poker.com/fp.html - the white bar at the edge of the page is an input element that should be pushed off the edge.
[11:11:12] <Wes-> and not be 100% tall, LOL
[11:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you've got some bad markup here and there.
[11:12:27] <robertmaxrees> might want to address thatfirst.
[11:13:24] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: Yeah. Been merging a couple of different pieces and trying to eliminate stuff until I figured out what the problem was.
[11:13:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd comment out the block that starts with the module.declare() call - see if your problem is in there.
[11:13:30] <Wes-> What are you using to validate?
[11:13:59] <robertmaxrees> my eyes and firefox's "view source"
[11:14:01] <davidpardy> Syntactically speaking, shouldnt line 2 be OK? the var key is returning a blank value, but if I do console.log(key) it returns the correct value. https://gist.github.com/ornerymoose/86d9962215ebfcf2acbd
[11:14:24] <robertmaxrees> Wes- http://i.imgur.com/6p145W8.png the red bit.
[11:14:32] <krambiorix> hi, when i enable my users to login into my webapplication via facebook, is there any way to save the username and even maybe more data about the user?
[11:14:39] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: I was thinking the same thing - and did it - I just made the module return without doing anything.  So something in there is being ugly. God I hate pouring through other people's code. :)
[11:15:02] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: WOW! I missed THAT!
[11:15:27] <robertmaxrees> davidpardy your "key" would just be the index.
[11:15:42] <robertmaxrees> davidpardy what is the results object?
[11:16:28] <decx> the closing double quote beofer ' + key
[11:16:38] <davidpardy> robertmaxrees: apologies, I updated the gist to show everything
[11:16:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not the rust use of each in this case.
[11:17:17] <robertmaxrees> *right use
[11:17:26] <robertmaxrees> either use $.each(results, function() {});, or just use the native forEach() array method
[11:18:45] <davidpardy> Good to know, thank you
[11:19:19] <davidpardy> decx: good catch, thanks. that helped
[11:27:04] <jwmann> I have this functionality where a user types into an input box and it renders the value in a square div box. My problem is that I'd like to change the font-size dynamically based on the amount of letters and space available, here is a simplified version of what I have. How would I accomplish this? - http://jsfiddle.net/v6do0ex6/
[11:27:45] <robertmaxrees> fyi .on() is preferred over bind - just as an aside.
[11:29:07] <jwmann> robertmaxrees: Thank you, I will update my code to reflect that in production :)
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> certainly not perfect: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6do0ex6/2/
[11:32:25] <robertmaxrees> tons of options out there.
[11:39:36] <jwmann> robertmaxrees: Nice :)
[11:40:00] <jwmann> never used the substr() method before
[11:41:54] <robertmaxrees> not gonna lie: google.
[11:46:14] <jwmann> robertmaxrees: Hahaha, I had feel thing would happen but your code explodes when the font-size become a single digit xD
[11:46:15] <tasaif> still lookin' for a job
[11:46:18] <tasaif> anybody hiring?
[11:46:30] <robertmaxrees> jwmann hah. yep.
[11:46:33] <robertmaxrees> like i said: google :)
[11:46:40] <jwmann> It actually crashed my chrome
[11:46:41] <jwmann> xD
[11:49:43] <Wes-> robertmaxrees:  thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction.  It's definitely not jquery-related -- pulling JQuery out was just causing a dependency to throw.  I've figure out that *somehow* a style change happens when the element is focused, I just haven't figured where that's happening (and firebug can't see it for some reason).
[11:50:41] <Eiam> why would 'typeof $' say "function" while 'typeof jQuery' would say "undefined" ? something else somewhere is defining $? my two includes are just bootstrap.js and jquery-1.11.2.js
[11:51:03] <robertmaxrees> Eiam chrome fills in its own version of $.
[11:51:09] <Eiam> Safari in this case
[11:51:10] <robertmaxrees> * in the dev tools
[11:51:15] <robertmaxrees> safari might, as well.
[11:51:22] <robertmaxrees> try doing $.fn.jquery
[11:51:24] <Eiam> okay so, I can see the jquery coming down in resources
[11:51:25] <robertmaxrees> no typeof.
[11:51:30] <Eiam> but somehow its still.. not there
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> just console.log($.fn.jquery);
[11:52:00] <Eiam> yeah so its not there, TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '$.fn.jquery')
[11:52:12] <robertmaxrees> are you in the console?
[11:52:14] <Eiam> yup
[11:52:21] <robertmaxrees> and you're 100% sure that jquery is successfully loading?
[11:52:41] <Eiam> well under "resouces" i see jquery-1.11.2.js" and if I click on it, i see the jquery source
[11:53:11] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading it?
[11:53:19] <Eiam> hmm
[11:53:21] <robertmaxrees> normal script tag, or requirejs?  or some other module loader?
[11:56:16] <Eiam> =( I was totally including it wrong, I had it under link instead of script so it was coming over as text/css. man that derp hurt hard.
[11:56:28] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[11:56:47] <Eiam> now it dies on         if (!a.document)
[11:56:54] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:57:03] <Eiam> hmm which is odd
[11:57:07] <Eiam> thats like saying i don't have a dom ?
[11:57:12] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[11:57:16] <robertmaxrees> what is "a" supposed to be?
[11:57:41] <Eiam> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js
[11:57:52] <Eiam> first line
[11:58:12] <robertmaxrees> there should be a stack trace from your code.
[11:58:21] <robertmaxrees> and/or your markup is bad.
[11:58:26] <robertmaxrees> but the lib should be fine.
[11:58:41] <Eiam> let me snag an un minified version
[11:58:52] <robertmaxrees> the lib isn't going to be your problem.
[11:58:53] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[11:59:54] <Eiam> weird. replaced it with the unminified version and it loads no problem
[11:59:58] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:00:05] * Eiam attempts to exit the twilight zone
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you have some kind of weird parsing/document issue.
[12:00:22] <Eiam> robertmaxrees: yeah =) lol. yes thats my thought
[12:00:29] <robertmaxrees> so fix the document issue.
[12:00:31] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's valid.
[13:43:36] <cool_boy> what is opposite method of click?
[13:45:07] <Oka> cool_boy: What?
[13:45:38] <snover> Oka: you took the word right out of my brain.
[13:45:43] <cool_boy> Oka: opposite of  $("element").click() event
[13:45:58] <aca20031> are you looking for mouse up? >.>
[13:46:08] <snover> what is the opposite of “click”
[13:46:58] <cool_boy> aca20031: I need to bind onscreen keyboard to an input field, I did that with .click(), but as soon as keyboard is closed input is erased
[13:47:38] <cool_boy> I have no idea why it is erased and how to handle it, I was thinking to give a try with opposite of .click() event
[13:47:48] <aca20031> theres no such thing :)
[13:47:52] <aca20031> it shouldnt be erased
[13:48:05] <cool_boy> :s
[13:48:26] <cool_boy> things are over my level :(
[13:52:31] <lvegerano> hello all! quick question I have a form and an event on submit() Because of some validation Im using event.preventDefault() during validation because the code is inside an .each() I return false on error. But then after I fix the error an attempt to resubmit the form fails to submit
[13:52:43] <lvegerano> looks like it doesnt even try
[13:53:59] <lvegerano> here is my code http://hastebin.com/dewudesaco.coffee
[13:54:26] <Subtlebots> Hey guys. Any ideas why $.ajax with type: "POST" would send a GET request instead? It sends POST locally, but on prod it sends GET. I'm kind of at a loss...
[13:55:56] <cool_boy> so there is something which seems working, if I can hide keyboard after text is inserted, in that case also I will need event which can detect click outside of element
[13:58:04] <AcidRain2012> bro
[13:58:18] <AcidRain2012> i been trying for a full hr to detect a link click with a class of "art-button"
[13:58:20] <AcidRain2012> :/
[13:58:27] <AcidRain2012> $(".art-button a").click(function () {
[13:58:59] <Subtlebots> That would select any anchor tag inside of any element with the class ".art-button"
[13:59:09] <nbt> AcidRain2012: if the <a> has class art-button then it should be $("a.art-button")...
[13:59:39] <AcidRain2012> i tried that. im desperate now putting things where i know they wont even work lol
[13:59:52] <lvegerano>  hello all! quick question I have a form and an event on submit() Because of some validation Im using event.preventDefault() during validation because the code is inside an .each() I return false on error. But then after I fix the error an attempt to resubmit the form fails to submit http://hastebin.com/dewudesaco.coffee
[14:00:05] <AcidRain2012> omfg
[14:00:36] <Subtlebots> So it worked
[14:01:01] <Sans31> hello, can someone tell me why the jquery script on line 66 is causing the video thumbnails to only play the first video? This same script doesn't cause this problem on post page.  What am i doing wrong.
[14:01:03] <Sans31> http://bit.ly/1F2zywS
[14:01:26] <Subtlebots> lol not even a thank you with that guy
[14:01:33] <Sans31> huh?
[14:01:43] <Sans31> i appreciate any and all help
[14:01:45] <Sans31> thanks
[14:01:48] <Subtlebots> Not you dude
[14:01:55] <Sans31> oh
[14:02:02] <Sans31> i take it all back !!! hahahah
[14:05:20] <Sans31> yo subtlebots
[14:09:18] <Sans31> yo esoteric
[14:11:35] <AcidRain2012> lol
[14:11:36] <AcidRain2012> im back
[14:11:37] <AcidRain2012> <3
[14:12:25] <Brodingo> Subtlebots line 86 is always getting the first iframe
[14:12:26] <AcidRain2012> k so, now that i spent a full hr trying to do something i thought i alrdy did, but apparently didnt. im appending a url to the inside of a div. the url has a class 'deleteDev', i cant seem to target this class
[14:12:38] <AcidRain2012> its for deleting the url obviously
[14:12:47] <cool_boy> Hi, I know I am asking much, but I am really not knowing how to get it working, I need to bind on-screen keyboard with an input field ( it is working for other fields), if someone think have some time and interested to help me, please let me know, I will share link & credentials for it be easy to debug
[14:13:41] <cool_boy> I have invested enough time but seems over my limits
[14:14:35] <kevireilly> cool_boy: what is your current approach for binding the OSK to an input field? perhaps a reduced test on jsfiddle.net would be enough
[14:18:40] <cool_boy> kevireilly: jsfiddle really won't be enough because I do not have enough skills, and application is complex
[14:18:47] <cool_boy> https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/8.0/addons/point_of_sale/static/src/js/screens.js#L1052
[14:19:19] <cool_boy> this is what I am inheriting
[14:19:23] <kevireilly> cool_boy: chances are you want to bind to the `focus` event of the input
[14:22:06] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/H97uhA0z
[14:22:20] <AcidRain2012> does anyone know why the section under //for deleting devs, doesnt work
[14:22:55] <cool_boy> kevireilly: thing is this application is already binding standard fields, I added a custom field and can't change that binding to consider my field
[14:23:59] <cool_boy> I have got two keyboards in application, onscreen and numpad, could bind onscreen keyboard to custom field but as soon as keyboard is closed input is erased
[14:25:10] <AcidRain2012> appears to not be detecting the newly generated link at all
[14:25:55] <tasaif> cool_boy: can you break down the problem you're having into smaller chunks?
[14:26:51] <tasaif> AcidRain2012: can you put the problem you're having into a fiddle so that I can interact with it?
[14:26:58] <cool_boy> tasaif: 1. I am customizing https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/8.0/addons/point_of_sale
[14:27:08] <cool_boy> 2. adding a field on a screen
[14:27:25] <cool_boy> 3. want to use virtual keyboard to input in that field ( physical is working)
[14:27:42] <tasaif> virtual keyboard?
[14:27:45] <AcidRain2012> tasaif ill try
[14:27:48] <tasaif> like the windows virtual keyboard?
[14:28:19] <cool_boy> tasaif: yes, onscreen  given in this application ( 1. onscreen, 2. numpad)
[14:29:15] <tasaif> does the software come with an onscreen keyboard?
[14:29:16] <cool_boy> I need to make input using numpad  keyboard but I could make only using full keyboard) but that also not working well, input is erased as soon as I close keyboard
[14:29:31] <cool_boy> tasaif: yes it does
[14:32:12] <Subtlebots> I'm back. Sorry, I sent this before: Under what circumstances could an $.ajax request with type: "POST" send a GET request instead? Locally (in vagrant) it behaves as expected and sends POST, on prod it sends GET.
[14:32:36] <AcidRain2012> wow
[14:32:43] <cool_boy> tasaif: http://postimg.org/image/6vd084j0z/ need to make input in cnpj cpf field with (numaric keypad) but it is binded with cash journal only
[14:32:44] <AcidRain2012> these keyboard shortcuts on jsfiddle.net dont work for me :/
[14:32:47] <AcidRain2012> only the run works
[14:33:06] <AcidRain2012> well i see the menu now
[14:33:06] <AcidRain2012> lol
[14:33:24] <AcidRain2012> tasaif https://jsfiddle.net/tfezzeyv/ if its too much for u to get it working. dont worry about it. i couldnt produce a working version of the first function
[14:33:39] <tasaif> brb real job takes priority
[14:35:28] <tasaif> Subtlebots: I can't think of one
[14:35:37] <Subtlebots> It's driving me crazy
[14:36:07] <tasaif> cool_boy: what's cnpj cpf?
[14:36:22] <Subtlebots> I'm going to just try out $.post instead. That would have to do it
[14:36:36] <cool_boy> tasaif: they are just text fields
[14:36:41] <tasaif> AcidRain2012: you have errors in your console
[14:36:48] <AcidRain2012> no errors
[14:37:15] <AcidRain2012> i know this has to do with delegation, has to
[14:37:16] <cool_boy> tasaif: please look at screenshot
[14:37:25] <cool_boy>  http://postimg.org/image/6vd084j0z/
[14:38:02] <tasaif> AcidRain2012: http://postimg.org/image/jnznaylkb/
[14:38:20] <tasaif> cool_boy: ok, now what?
[14:38:24] <AcidRain2012> im not even getting that far
[14:39:15] <tasaif> Subtlebots: if it doesn't, then maybe the problem is elsewhere
[14:39:21] <AcidRain2012> $("a").on("click", ".deleteDev", function (event) {   <--- isnt even being called
[14:39:51] <tasaif> AcidRain2012: I don't think any of the code is running because you have that error
[14:40:05] <AcidRain2012> i removed that line. still no call
[14:40:15] <AcidRain2012> i couldnt get any of it to run in jsfiddle
[14:40:19] <Subtlebots> That's what I figured. I'm just not sure what the difference could be between my local and prod environments
[14:40:35] <Subtlebots> to cause such a bug
[14:40:36] <cool_boy> tasaif: if you have some time, I could give you link  for debug and try won't be possible with fiddle
[14:40:38] <tasaif> Subtlebots: maybe something is cached?
[14:41:46] <Subtlebots> Possibly. Something funky
[14:42:59] <AcidRain2012> tasaif k i got it to run https://jsfiddle.net/tfezzeyv/2/
[14:43:15] <AcidRain2012> look at the second function, everything under //for deleting devs isnt called
[14:43:37] <tasaif> AcidRain2012: you need event delegation
[14:43:45] <AcidRain2012> i thought thats what i have?
[14:43:49] <AcidRain2012> .on() ?
[14:43:52] <tasaif> either that or you need to bind that function on each new object you create
[14:44:09] <AcidRain2012> doc says .on() replaced .delegate()
[14:44:34] <tasaif> https://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/tfezzeyv/3/
[14:45:01] <AcidRain2012> er
[14:45:08] <AcidRain2012> k i see whats going on now
[14:45:11] <AcidRain2012> thank you man
[14:45:13] <tasaif> np
[14:45:22] <AcidRain2012> i gotta use an existing element
[14:45:26] <tasaif> exactly
[14:45:42] <youngblood> hello all. how would I search and hide div.print-only if it only equals the comment label, like this..
[14:45:54] <youngblood> <div class="read-only print-only"><label>Comment:</label></div>
[14:46:36] <youngblood> ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/7DTMf/44/
[14:46:44] <tasaif> cool_boy I'm sorry, I only work with fiddles
[14:47:55] <cool_boy> tasaif: np, thanks for your time, it has lots of interrelated  methods (because I have less skills, we can not do it on fiddle)
[14:49:38] <Subtlebots> tasaif: Yeah, something is definitely messed up. Even with $.post it is sending GET. Odd thing, it isn't cached. My script is inline and I can see it updated to $.post in the inspector.
[14:49:46] <Subtlebots>  I just tried removing the $.post entirely and confirmed it's not sending off a random ajax call somewhere.
[14:53:09] <youngblood> http://jsfiddle.net/9ahsd4ao/ .. better jsfiddle example for trying to hide div.print-only if equal to <label>Commit:</label> thanks.
[14:54:51] <tasaif> youngblood: can you put a class on the label?
[14:55:11] <youngblood> tasaif: yup
[14:55:27] <tasaif> or maybe put the comment in a span
[14:55:28] <tasaif> or a p
[14:55:41] <youngblood> not my code, but can edit it if needed. this jquery is going into a casperjs script though.
[14:55:54] <decx> just dont output the div serverside if there are no comments
[14:55:55] <youngblood> tasaif: ^^
[14:56:56] <tasaif> Subtlebots: I wonder if it shows in the Network tab of your developer thing
[14:57:06] <youngblood> decx: yup. agree. was hoping I could do some js here, and put it in casperjs to do screen captures though. tasaif
[14:59:28] <Subtlebots> tasaif: Wow, it does. It's sending POST. I've been seeing a GET error in my console (only on the server) and assumed it's sending the wrong type of request
[15:01:00] <Subtlebots> Thanks tasaif, I was fighting the wrong issue for a while.
[15:01:18] <tasaif> np
[15:05:46] <Subtlebots> I finally found it. My path had a trailing "/". The server didn't understand, threw a 301, and redirected to GET the same path without the slash. Ouch.
[15:15:21] <tasaif> Subtlebots: weird
[15:15:23] <tasaif> good to now
[15:15:25] <tasaif> know*
[15:21:20] <Subtlebots> Yeah, thanks again for the help. I hadn't given enough attention to the network tab
[15:22:37] <tasaif> youngblood: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/9ahsd4ao/3/
[15:22:55] <tasaif> np
[15:25:59] <zeroquake> how can we get 3rd tr row from 3 tables in same page
[15:26:18] <robertmaxrees> the third "table row" row :)
[15:28:54] <robertmaxrees> do you need all three of them?
[15:29:17] <zeroquake> just the third row in each table
[15:29:36] <robertmaxrees> right -= did you need a single object that contains all three?
[15:30:02] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/rq0tmhfb/
[15:30:04] <zeroquake> An array?
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:30:54] <tasaif> I mean… that does it right?
[15:31:13] <zeroquake> thats like every third child in the same table.
[15:31:27] <tasaif> …
[15:31:32] <tasaif> wut?
[15:31:33] <Subtlebots> what?
[15:31:40] <Subtlebots> It's the third row in every table.
[15:31:50] <Subtlebots> That's the selector you are looking for.
[15:32:00] <zeroquake> yes, my bad. thank you.
[15:32:02] <robertmaxrees> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6anz0k5/
[15:32:08] <robertmaxrees> if selectors aren't your thing.
[15:32:40] <zeroquake> thank you.
[15:41:04] <tasaif> np
[16:17:20] <cool_boy> how do I return value of discount computed computed at line 32
[16:17:21] <cool_boy> http://pastebin.com/KKtm4aSm
[16:17:52] <robertmaxrees> doesn't work that way.
[16:18:05] <robertmaxrees> need to explicitly call the next function and pass in that value.
[16:20:59] <nikio_> hey how can i do something on a succes response to window.location.href = 'data.php?task=download&fileid=' + fileid ?
[16:21:15] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ what?
[16:21:20] <robertmaxrees> like in an ajax call?
[16:21:30] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, yes like a succes callback
[16:21:46] <robertmaxrees> if you're doing ajax, there's a success and a .done() callback.
[16:21:54] <nikio_> im doing hey how can i do something on a succes response to window.location.href = 'data.php?task=download&fileid=' + fileid ?
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(function(theData) {});
[16:22:02] <nikio_> oops
[16:22:09] <nikio_> im doing window.location.href = 'data.php?task=download&fileid=' + fileid ?
[16:22:18] <robertmaxrees> in an ajax call?
[16:22:22] <nikio_> nope
[16:22:26] <nikio_> can it be done?
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> ... that's a new pagelaod.
[16:22:34] <robertmaxrees> *pageload.
[16:22:37] <robertmaxrees> you treat it like any other.
[16:23:04] <nikio_> its actualy downloading without changng  page robertmaxrees
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> oh you're directly linking to a file.  that's a separate window deal - pretty sure there's no success event without some weirdo wrangling.
[16:23:52] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, the thing is i want something tho change on the page, actually hide a progress bar once the file actually starts downloading
[16:24:08] <nikio_> so i have to detect that somehow
[17:18:09] <DragonPunch> \o
[17:18:29] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[17:26:32] <robertmaxrees> I have an API that provides a JSONP feed, but instead of naming the callback querystring parameter "callback", they call it "foo".
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> how do I change the url parameter jquery uses to "name" the callback.
[17:32:01] <shoky> robertmaxrees:  dataType: 'jsonp', jsonp: 'foo'
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> nonono - i need to name the querystring param itself.
[17:33:58] <robertmaxrees> instead of callback=functionName, it's foo=functionName
[17:39:20] <shoky> yes, that's what i gave you, i think..?
[17:39:37] <shoky> or am i misunderstanding
[17:40:00] <robertmaxrees> i thoght the jsonp: param is the name of the function.
[17:40:04] <shoky> $.ajax has a "jsonp" option
[17:40:06] <robertmaxrees> not of the querystring parameter itself.
[17:40:32] <shoky> the name of the actuall callback can be changed with "jsonpCallback"
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> oooooohhhh....
[17:40:57] <robertmaxrees> thank you.
[17:40:58] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[17:41:05] <shoky> np ;)
[17:41:06] <robertmaxrees> you're 100% right.  i couldn't read that for some reason.
[17:41:17] <nikio_> so
[17:41:27] <shoky> yuh i always go back and read those 2 carefully, easy to confuse
[17:41:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah - thank you for correcting me :D
[17:41:43] <shoky> ;D
[17:41:44] <nikio_> how to detect that a download query  has been responded to and the user is downloading the file?
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm messing around with a backbone view that does way more than it should and seeing if I can't get the callback to do some things.
[17:42:58] <Lencl> could we ask backbone questions here
[17:43:11] <robertmaxrees> Lencl those are better suited for #documentcloud
[17:43:28] <Lencl> ok ty
[17:44:17] <Lencl> I'm actually trying to get something similar to .on('change') working.. could I do that with objects?
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:44:24] <Lencl> like $object.on('change')
[17:44:27] <Lencl> ah
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:44:37] <robertmaxrees> sort of - you need observables or getters/setters.
[17:44:51] <Lencl> the $object would be like $('#elem')
[17:45:06] <robertmaxrees> is the $object an element?
[17:45:23] <Lencl> yes
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> so you did var $object = $('#elem')?  because in that case, yes.
[17:45:44] <robertmaxrees> $object.on('change', function() {});  works fine.
[17:45:51] <Lencl> oh I see
[17:46:04] <Lencl> okay must be a backbone issue then, thank you
[17:46:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:46:28] <Lencl> I'm doing something like that in backbone and I figured it would work if it works on jquery
[17:46:37] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:58:48] <robertmaxrees> shoky++ saved me from some other headaches, too.
[18:37:44] <Lencl> I have an .on('change').. done on an input text field
[18:38:05] <Lencl> but it seems the function is called after I click outside the input?
[19:13:47] <felipedvorak> Lencl: You probably need another function for when the user stops typing like keyup
[19:13:58] <felipedvorak> If thats what you want
[19:19:45] <tejasmanohar> if i have https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/53103730d28bc5b9d1dd element in a jquery object in a var
[19:19:53] <tejasmanohar> and i want to extract that 2
[19:19:57] <tejasmanohar> how do i do that w/ jq?
[19:20:02] <tejasmanohar> .find() ?
[19:29:24] <DragonPunch> Anyone knows how to deal with contetnEdtiable? I'm appending a div to one of my containers and it's removing all the content that I previously typed into my contentEditable.
[20:21:10] <tejasmanohar> jQ map vs array map?
[23:10:46] <JZA> hi is there a way I can hide the routes that dont have trips on the tables using  JQuery DOM Transversing?
[23:10:48] <JZA> http://jsfiddle.net/qL6rcgga/
[23:12:35] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[23:13:50] <al-damiri> I have a few functions created by another colleague. They are all async $.xmlrpc() function calls and they are quite big. Now, we have a need to perform all those function calls and on sucess of all of them, do a specific action.
[23:14:13] <al-damiri> How do I make sure that my action is called after all the $.xmlrpc() calls have successfully completed?
[23:14:35] <JZA> hi is there a way I can hide the routes that dont have trips on the tables using  JQuery DOM Transversing?
[23:14:37] <JZA> http://jsfiddle.net/qL6rcgga/
[23:15:37] <JZA> al-damiri: perform a conditional that catches the return, on success or != unsuccess do whatever you need to do.
[23:16:25] <al-damiri> JZA: They are async.
[23:29:22] <Cork> al-damiri: the simplest solution is to expose the jqxhr object $.ajax/$.get/$.post gives you
[23:29:32] <Cork> al-damiri: and then feed them to $.when().done
[23:30:44] <Cork> JZA: can you modify the html?
[23:30:56] <JZA> yes
[23:31:03] <Cork> then always add the <tbody> element
[23:31:21] <Cork> then you can simply do $('tbody:empty).closest('table').hide()
[23:31:30] <Cork> * $('tbody:empty').closest('table').hide()
[23:31:34] <al-damiri> Cork: We are using the jQuery XMLRPC plugin, a/c to its docs, it says that it is built upon the $.ajax(), so does it also returns the jqXHR object?
[23:32:02] <Cork> al-damiri: i don't know
[23:32:10] <Cork> check what the function returns
[23:32:28] <Cork> if it has .done/.fail/.always your most likely lucky
[23:32:36] <al-damiri> Cork: Or more better how do I check if the returned object is of type jqXHR?
[23:32:48] <Cork> * see my last comment *
[23:34:44] <al-damiri> Cork: Alrighty. Let me check that.
[23:34:44] <al-damiri> Cork: Yes it indeed has them.
[23:34:44] <al-damiri> Cork: Just a general question, is there anyway in JS, that you can check if the obj/var is of prototype X? (In our case check if it is a jqXHR)?
[23:35:23] <Cork> al-damiri: depends if it is created with new you can
[23:35:26] <al-damiri> Cork: I read that. The object return by $.xmlrpc returns a jqXHR.
[23:35:36] <Cork> if(variable instanceOf Constructor) {}
[23:35:50] <al-damiri> Cork: I see.
[23:35:54] <ionico> hi cork
[23:35:55] <al-damiri> Cork: Thanks.
[23:36:05] <Cork> but many do it in other ways so the instanceOf doesn't work
[23:36:12] <Cork> ionico: o/
[23:37:55] <Cork> js> print([] instanceof Array)
[23:37:59] <b-ot> Cork: true

[23:41:11] <xploshioon> hi guys, i am using http://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn/getting-started/ with x-editable but for some reason when the editable is in the table it doesn't show the edit field, but just in the table. if it is in another part of my site, it works without problems
[23:41:58] <Cork> xploshioon: => ##bootstrap
[23:42:32] <Cork> or possibly ##twitter-bootstrap
[23:42:51] <xploshioon> i think is something with jquery, but let's try in that channel
[23:42:53] <xploshioon> thanks
