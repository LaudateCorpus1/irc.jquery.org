[03:31:44] <onizu> hi
[03:32:29] <onizu>    $('.summaryCategDataEditLnk').on('click', (event) => { ---------- in this case, how can I get the object being clicked inside the { .. }
[03:33:34] <onizu> if I try as  thisElem = $(this) .. it gives out the entire html
[03:34:08] <onizu> the .on function is on a class selector, so there are many such elements. I want to capture the ID of the one that is clicked
[08:29:35] <mulch2> onizu: $(this).attr("id")
[08:30:05] <onizu> mulch2:  I had to do event.target
[08:30:32] <onizu> $(this) returns the whole HTML
[09:47:10] <Cork> onizu: replace (event) => with function(event) {}
[09:47:16] <Cork> then you get a this variable
[09:50:11] <Cork> if you prefer you can also use event.currentTarget
[09:50:15] <Cork> as it is the same as the this variable
[09:51:25] <Cork> (note many point to event.target, but that is NOT the same as the this variable)
[10:04:08] <onizu> ok
[10:52:45] <primitivMedia> is it possible for something to be undefined but then pass my check to see if its undefined?
[10:52:53] <primitivMedia> or would that indicat the code is at fault
[10:54:18] <primitivMedia> this.typeof != 'undefined'
[10:54:24] <primitivMedia> that should be ok?
[12:27:59] <CuirPork> Are there any built-in ways of generating a unique ID in jquery? If not, any suggestions for best ways to generate unique IDs?
[12:31:55] <robertmaxrees> CuirPork since jquery is a DOM abstraction library, it's not really going to have that kind of ability.  what are you going to use these unique IDs for?
[12:33:01] <CuirPork> I am creating a simple "trigger warning" thing that lets you place a warning before expressing an opinion that might be triggering. I want to toggle the warning's visibility based on a hidden checkbox (which requires an id)
[12:36:33] <robertmaxrees> CuirPork are there multiples of these?
[12:36:39] <CuirPork> Could be.
[12:37:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd generate those server-side or tie the ids to the values somehow.
[12:37:11] <CuirPork> I'm building a block for WordPress
[12:37:37] <robertmaxrees> not familiar enough with WordPress to understand what that means :)
[12:38:14] <CuirPork> Just means that someone could put a lot of them in a n article if they wanted. Blocks are like little modules or chunks of content.
[12:39:16] <CuirPork> right now I'm using a recursive function that initializes all of these on page load. Just thought I'd check that there wasn't something under the hood that I could use. Thanks.
[12:41:57] <robertmaxrees> fair.  yeah, iirc jquery has some tooling for generating UID's internally but doesn't expose it for you to use :)
