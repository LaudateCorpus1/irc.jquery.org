[00:01:43] <LopiTopi> Hey guys. Is there a function which returns an array consisting of the same value
[00:01:57] <LopiTopi> So for example I want an array of 5 "test" values
[00:06:09] <Cork> LopiTopi: you mean a function to repeat the given value?
[00:07:23] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify(Array(5).fill('test')))
[00:07:28] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[00:07:31] <Cork> <_<
[00:07:51] <Cork> stupid bot...
[00:10:44] <Uhkis> js> print('test')
[00:10:47] <b-ot> Uhkis: test
[00:12:18] <Cork> Uhkis: the bot most likely run v8, and v8 isn't the best when it comes to es6
[00:20:13] <gregor3005> hi, can anybody point me in the right direction: i have some images on a page, when i click on them these image should expand to the whole page. (not a normal link to the source)
[00:21:14] <gregor3005> (overlay expand) ?
[00:21:56] <marahin> Cork: was that you who helped me yesterday, with the $.when.apply() directive?
[00:22:10] <Cork> marahin: ya?
[00:22:37] <Cork> gregor3005: check transform
[00:22:46] <Cork> ?mdn css transform
[00:22:47] <b-ot> Cork: transform - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[00:22:57] <marahin> Cork: I had to go yesterday, and couldn't make it back till now :'P. Anyways, well, $when.apply drops undefined three times.
[00:23:10] <Cork> hmm
[00:27:07] <marahin> Cork: want me to paste the code again?
[00:27:20] <Cork> marahin: building a demo
[00:27:26] <marahin> Cork: alrighty
[00:27:45] <marahin> Cork: can I give you the data source URL though? It'll be easier to debug then, maybe, if we have the same data set.
[00:28:38] <gregor3005> Cork: thank you, its exactly what i'm searching for
[00:32:38] <Cork> marahin: http://jsfiddle.net/1faqsj43/
[00:32:50] <Cork> so ya, was som errors in the done handling :)
[00:42:21] <roelmonnens> What's the difference between $(document).ready() and $(document).bind('ready') ?
[00:43:05] <Cork> roelmonnens: .bind('ready') doesn't exist
[00:43:14] <roelmonnens> of $(document).on('ready') ?
[00:43:18] <Cork> same
[00:43:34] <Cork> its $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {})
[00:43:42] <Cork> it's a function not an event
[00:45:03] <Arcarc> Can someone help me with this problem? http://pastebin.com/xFegRdcE
[00:45:13] <Cork> define "problem"
[00:45:19] <Arcarc> Only the first line seems to be executed for some reason.
[00:45:30] <roelmonnens> $(document).ready(function() {}) and $(document).on('ready', function() {}) both works!
[00:45:51] <roelmonnens> I'm just wondering if there are differences or is it just a shorthand functions?
[00:45:52] <Cork> Arcarc: your looking at the wrong place
[00:46:41] <Cork> roelmonnens: as i said the function is .ready
[00:46:48] <Arcarc> Cork: Figures... not sure where I should be looking though
[00:46:58] <Cork> there might be a fake event hook to access it through .bind or .on too, but the function is .ready
[00:47:05] <roelmonnens> k
[00:47:14] <Cork> Arcarc: try to reproduce the problem in a demo on jsfiddle
[00:47:25] <Cork> meaning running working code
[00:47:42] <Cork> ah
[00:47:48] <Cork> 		if ( jQuery.fn.triggerHandler ) {
[00:47:48] <Cork> 			jQuery( document ).triggerHandler( "ready" );
[00:47:48] <Cork> 			jQuery( document ).off( "ready" );
[00:47:48] <Cork> 		}
[00:48:04] <Cork> roelmonnens: so yes, .ready triggers fake ready events as the last thing it does
[00:48:14] <Cork> interesting, didn't know that
[00:50:13] <Arcarc> Cork: Nevermind, fixed it! Needed to add all script sources to all pages
[00:51:22] <Arcarc> Guess the jQuery just shuts down when it can't find a specific script on a page
[00:51:56] <Cork> Arcarc: uh, script that isn't loaded can't magically run no
[00:52:22] <Arcarc> Was using SmoothScroll on page 1 and DatePicker on page 2
[00:52:25] <Arcarc> Quite obvious in hindsight
[00:52:29] <Arcarc> But didn't occur to me
[00:52:31] <Arcarc> :}
[00:52:41] <Arcarc> Oh well

[00:53:36] <mauro1254> Hi guys, I have a problem with jquery ui selectable plugin. Anyone who can help?
[00:53:38] <surianup> I am adding the active class on the clicking on 3 buttons
[00:53:53] <surianup> but I have to reve also when clicks on other 2
[00:54:00] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/2yz2cknj/1/
[00:54:14] <surianup> please can anyone see the issue
[00:54:21] <surianup> M fussy in jquery
[00:54:42] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/2yz2cknj/2/
[00:54:49] <surianup> thi sis the code
[00:54:59] <Cork> surianup: uh... that is way overcomplicated
[00:55:36] <mauro1254> https://jsfiddle.net/un6Lxmac/1/
[00:55:43] <mauro1254> WHy is selectable slow?
[00:55:55] <mauro1254> I'm trying to implement a calendar
[00:56:00] <surianup> why Cork
[00:56:03] <Cork> surianup:

[00:56:51] <surianup> You are genious
[00:56:54] <Cork> surianup: cause you already have the target in this, why select it by id when you already have it
[00:56:56] <surianup> really
[00:58:46] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/2yz2cknj/6/ now with setting current inactive
[00:59:13] <surianup> thanks Cork as usual you are great
[00:59:38] <mauro1254> Help with 	https://jsfiddle.net/un6Lxmac/1/ please?
[00:59:48] <mauro1254> Selectable is slow
[01:00:18] <Cork> Uhkis: you don't need $() there though
[01:00:30] <Cork> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/2yz2cknj/7/
[01:00:56] <Cork> mauro1254: don't append in a loop
[01:01:07] <Cork> that is a very good way to kill browser performance
[01:01:29] <Cork> mauro1254: build an array and append(arr.join('')) after the loop
[01:01:47] <Cork> also no tag name infront of ids
[01:02:00] <mauro1254> Cork: this is to provide a gist, the table is going to be built server side
[01:02:03] <mauro1254> But ...
[01:02:18] <mauro1254> With chrome / IE is slow, with firefox and safari is better
[01:02:36] <mauro1254> I'll try with array
[01:03:22] <Uhkis> Cork: wouldn't appending to string instead of array be fast? no conversion after
[01:03:28] <Uhkis> *faster
[01:03:34] <Cork> Uhkis: .join('')
[01:03:49] <Cork> Uhkis: concating a string is slower then building an array
[01:03:56] <Uhkis> ok
[01:04:12] <Cork> Uhkis: cause every time you modify the string you copy the old string to a new position (as it has to be continuous)
[01:04:49] <Uhkis> whoa, a lot fast
[01:04:58] <Uhkis> *faster again :D
[01:05:30] <Cork> mauro1254: haven't used selectable much, so not sure why you get the speed problem you have
[01:05:35] <mauro1254> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/un6Lxmac/2/
[01:05:39] <mauro1254> It is slow
[01:06:08] <Cork> its actually quite fast here
[01:06:12] <Cork> (chrome and firefox)
[01:06:13] <mauro1254> Well, there are 365 * 2 * 12 = 8760 cells
[01:06:26] <mauro1254> These cells are selectable ...
[01:06:39] <Uhkis> ~200ms delay after click
[01:06:50] <mauro1254> The problem is the delay ... Try with safari ...
[01:07:01] <Cork> ah, click
[01:07:07] <Uhkis> no macs around
[01:07:08] <Cork> thought you talked about the dragging
[01:07:36] <mauro1254> Sorry, I didn't explain the problem very well ... It is about the click
[01:07:40] <Cork> the delay is ~20-80 ms here
[01:07:54] <mauro1254> If I reduce the number of cells then the problem disappear
[01:08:14] <mauro1254> https://jsfiddle.net/un6Lxmac/3/
[01:08:20] <Uhkis> well no wonder, that dom is pretty huge
[01:08:21] <Cork> mauro1254: might be cause selectable needs to loop the elements
[01:08:22] <mauro1254> But I need the entire year
[01:08:45] <Cork> mauro1254: you could try building it without a table
[01:08:56] <Cork> tables is very costly to use cause of all the math the demand
[01:09:03] <Cork> *they
[01:09:17] <mauro1254> I already changed the layout to
[01:09:19] <mauro1254> fixed
[01:09:25] <mauro1254> In order to speed up rendering
[01:09:38] <Cork> there is much more to tables then that
[01:10:00] <mauro1254> Are there other tricks to optimize the table?
[01:10:14] <Cork> like i said, try not using tables
[01:10:27] <mooncup> divs 4 lyfe
[01:11:13] <Cork> mauro1254: for ex. changing the top border on a td affects the border on a td on the previous tr line
[01:11:23] <Cork> and you have colspan and rowspan
[01:11:35] <mauro1254> Yes, I need that
[01:11:35] <Cork> so the browser has to traverse the dom back and forth for every css change
[01:11:40] <Cork> this makes table costly
[01:12:12] <Cork> also, it might be something in how selectable works
[01:12:19] <Cork> not sure i haven't used it much
[01:14:40] <mauro1254> https://jsfiddle.net/un6Lxmac/4/
[01:15:00] <mauro1254> Same problem also removing rowspan and bottom border
[01:15:06] <mauro1254> I think it is related to selectable
[01:15:51] <mauro1254> Do you know a selectable alternative ?
[01:16:00] <mauro1254> 3d parties library
[01:16:22] <Uhkis> i just tried it with divs instead of table, just as slow
[01:19:40] <mauro1254> Thx Uhkis
[01:27:43] <Cork> ok so it is a selectable problem
[01:35:47] <mauro1254> any alternative to selectable ?
[01:37:04] <mauro1254> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=selectable
[01:41:47] <Cork> lovely that's quite old
[01:42:05] <Cork> mauro1254: do you need the drag select feature?
[01:42:10] <Cork> or just click?
[01:42:30] <mauro1254> Yes I need the drag select
[01:42:55] <mauro1254> In order to be able to select intervals of days
[01:43:21] <bewilled> Hello all, I'm getting this weird problem where the page transition works well the first time, but stops working after the transition has been executed. I'm using jquery mobile tap event to trigger the transition with changePage http://pastebin.com/DdVF784n
[01:44:20] <Cork> mauro1254: personally i would prob just write it my self
[01:44:43] <Cork> mauro1254: not sure there is a drag select alternative
[01:57:01] <mauro1254> Cork: thx but probably it would be better to optimize jquery ui selectable ...
[01:57:18] <Cork> mauro1254: that can be quite hard, but sure go for it
[01:57:35] <Cork> submit a patch if you find a way :)
[01:57:53] <mauro1254> Cork: I can live with the click delay and wait for a patch from the jquery ui team
[01:58:07] <Cork> mauro1254: the bug about the performance is 7 years old
[01:58:20] <Cork> it will most likely take a while before something happens there
[01:58:54] <mauro1254> yesss
[01:59:26] <mauro1254> It is not a big issue but can be annoying...
[02:17:15] <basiclaser> Hey guys I'm wondering how to have an eventlistener as a method in an object. Should I call it once, after which it will be listening?
[02:18:17] <Cork> basiclaser: not sure what you mean
[02:18:23] <Cork> could you show the code?
[02:18:52] <basiclaser> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/DAADGkf7
[02:19:17] <basiclaser> do i need to 'initiate' that on?
[02:20:07] <Cork> basiclaser: function (cbfunction){ <-- this won't work
[02:20:11] <Cork> it won't ever be a function
[02:20:28] <Cork> the first argument to the on callback is event
[02:20:40] <basiclaser> ok so two questions then Cork :P
[02:21:01] <Cork> basiclaser: and secondly you would have to make listener a function
[02:21:10] <basiclaser> forgetting the callback for now, will the .on exist or do i have to call object.listener() first?
[02:21:14] <Cork> listener: function() { /* code */ }
[02:21:24] <basiclaser> ohh..
[02:21:25] <basiclaser> ok
[02:21:43] <Cork> basiclaser: if you want code to run you will have to run it
[02:22:56] <troop> hello
[02:23:33] <toomus> hi
[02:23:54] <basiclaser> Cork: so lets say I wanted to run this listener function with an optional callback, where would I insert that callback?
[02:24:01] <basiclaser> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/IKsrV9RK
[02:24:10] <troop> http://pastebin.com/3FWDLS5v  can someone explain me please, in 17. line voteInfo takes two parameters but in line 60 takes 3 parameters... why?
[02:24:18] <Cork> basiclaser: in the listener function declaration
[02:27:09] <spyyke> Hello, a common question i would need pointers on how to do this: Set all radio boxes on page to be a certain value based on a select

[02:35:57] <Omar-> is there a better way to collect several class in one variable and then call .removeClass()?
[02:36:25] <Omar-> the commit has failed to merge. I'm afraid it's caused by poor coding
[02:37:47] <Cork> Omar-: uh, ya... just build an array
[02:37:50] <Cork> and .join(' ')
[02:38:15] <Cork> that looks kinda horrible to be honest...
[02:39:14] <Omar-> lol
[02:39:16] <Omar-> i know
[02:39:35] <Omar-> i'll try another method and get back to you

[02:50:29] <Omar-> perfect!

[02:54:01] <Omar-> Cork: http://www.codeshare.io/jUP7q
[02:55:10] <Cork> Omar-: the [] doesn't aline anymore, but if you prefer
[02:56:03] <Omar-> Cork just to make it look easier to read
[02:56:26] <Cork> Omar-: then put the [ on the second line and move ]}.join(' ') to a second wrapping
[02:56:33] <Omar-> shall I leave an attribution for you?
[02:56:38] <Cork> no
[02:56:45] <Omar-> ok
[02:57:04] <Cork> Omar-: what i meant is i have problem when indentation isn't correct
[02:57:06] <Omar-> you mean .join next line
[02:57:09] <Cork> it bugs me :)
[02:57:11] <Cork> ya
[02:57:13] <Omar-> haha
[02:57:51] <Omar-> http://www.codeshare.io/jUP7q

[02:58:00] <Cork> if you find that easier to read
[02:58:10] <Cork> (i use the other markup a lot so...)
[03:00:08] <Omar-> Cork indenting isnt easy at all
[03:00:23] <Cork> it isn't that hard
[03:00:35] <Cork> though i've been doing it for... ug a long time :)
[03:00:44] <Cork> so practice makes perfect i guess

[05:31:18] <LupiO> Hey guys. How can I iterate over an JSON object like I'm doing it with $.grep() with array?
[05:33:13] <Cork> LupiO: json is just a string
[05:34:26] <LupiO> I mean a javascript-object which contains "0", "1" etc. as property
[05:34:55] <Cork> uh you mean ["0", "1"] ?
[05:35:05] <Cork> you left out the important parts :)
[05:35:41] <LupiO> NO I mean {"0":"test123"}
[05:36:07] <Cork> that looks like just a server generating objects instead of arrays
[05:36:29] <LupiO> Yeah
[05:36:40] <Cork> so... why not just fix the php code?
[05:36:59] <Cork> anyway Object.values(obj) == array
[05:37:15] <Cork> ?mdn object.values

[05:37:44] <Cork> gah. right
[05:37:48] <Cork> that is es6 :/
[05:38:18] <Cork> LupiO: $.map(obj, function(elm, value), { return value; })
[05:38:36] <Cork> LupiO: * $.map(obj, function(key, value), { return value; })
[05:39:04] <Cork> LupiO: so ya, if possible get the server to send the array as an array instead

[06:45:48] <Elon_MuSk> Why is it impossible to return success data from ajax call?
[06:47:35] <Elon_MuSk> Ok never mind, I have to make seperate ajax calls for all functions that requires it. Can't rely on one function for all ajax requests, they will conflict
[06:47:59] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I downloaded jquery, jquer.ui with datepicker and slider widgets and placed this under: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[06:48:01] <wheeei> whats the point in wrapping a plugins initilization inside a anonymous function?
[06:48:04] <PCatinean> and still it doesn't load, any idea why?
[06:50:10] <Cork> Elon_MuSk: you can't return the success from an ajax call, cause the function making the ajax call will exist BEFORE the response from the ajax call comes back
[06:50:34] <Cork> Elon_MuSk: as ajax is async, they guarantee that the currently running code stack will exit before the callback is called

[06:51:47] <Elon_MuSk> Cork: that makes sense thanks
[06:52:06] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: just replace \d+ with \d*
[06:52:56] <jeffreylevesque> for just the else if?
[06:52:59] <PCatinean> anyone?
[06:53:15] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: just for the first \d+ in that if ya
[06:53:58] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: if you don't care about differentiating between the types you could try parseFloat()
[06:54:10] <Cork> if you get NaN it wasn't one :)
[06:54:42] <Cork> js> print(parseFloat('5'))
[06:54:46] <b-ot> Cork: 5
[06:54:47] <Cork> js> print(parseFloat('a'))
[06:54:51] <b-ot> Cork: NaN
[06:55:58] <jeffreylevesque> Cork: NaN says a hex is a number though?
[06:56:11] <Cork> you mean something like 0xff ?
[06:56:16] <jeffreylevesque> yes sir
[06:56:20] <Cork> js> print(parseFloat('0xff'))
[06:56:24] <b-ot> Cork: 0
[06:56:34] <Cork> so not really :)
[06:56:38] <Cork> but almost
[06:59:22] <jeffreylevesque> Cork `parseFloat('7j')` results in 7 in console log
[06:59:29] <Cork> ya
[07:00:06] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: if you say what you try to do it would make answering "how to best do it" a lot easier
[07:01:18] <jeffreylevesque> i'm trying to validate a string as numeric only without and letters, or special chars
[07:01:52] <Cork> so why not just do /^[0-9.]+$/ ?
[07:02:05] <jeffreylevesque> Cork, your suggestion with the d+ to d* works
[07:02:07] <Cork> that would allow multiple dots
[07:02:46] <jeffreylevesque> your first suggestion with replacing the first d+ allows ints, and floats
[07:02:51] <jeffreylevesque> thank you :)
[07:03:01] <Cork> or just /^\d*\.\d?$/
[07:03:07] <Cork> and replace all of them with that
[07:03:14] <Cork> dam sorry
[07:03:17] <Cork> or just /^\d*\.\d*$/
[07:03:25] <Cork> ...
[07:03:30] <Cork> or just /^\d*\.?\d*$/
[07:03:32] <Cork> THERE XD
[07:03:48] <decx> what about 10? is it 10 or 16 ^^
[07:04:18] <Cork> decx: 10 is always 10
[07:04:30] <Cork> though 010 could be 10 or 9 :)
[07:08:28] <jeffreylevesque> how do i eliminate the 0 condition?
[07:08:33] <jeffreylevesque> like 0010
[07:08:39] <jeffreylevesque> or 006
[07:08:54] <jeffreylevesque> add a negated class?
[07:11:23] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I downloaded jquery, jquer.ui with datepicker and slider widgets and placed this under: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[07:11:37] <PCatinean> and it still does nothing, anyone know where I have gone wrong?
[07:16:04] <topdownj1> Can anybody help me figure out what's wrong with this Flexslider implementation?: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zxgjLq
[07:16:26] <topdownj1> 1) When I click the right arrow on the main slideshow past the end, the nav slider doesn't loop back
[07:16:48] <topdownj1> 2) When I click the right arrow on the main slideshow to slide 2, the nav slider doesn't "activate" its second slide (but works when I get to 3 and above)
[07:18:38] <jen__> Can I achieve this rollover effect using JQuery tooltips (I am using Bootstrap framework): http://www.alphalofts.com/loft-location-ny-nj-mobile/index
[07:34:03] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I downloaded jquery, jquer.ui with datepicker and slider widgets and placed this under: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[07:34:10] <PCatinean> and still it doesn't load, any idea why?
[07:35:44] <arthurvr> PCatinean: let me take a look
[07:36:12] * PCatinean now believes in a higher power
[07:36:15] <PCatinean> somebody answered :))
[07:36:25] <PCatinean> I have no public exmaple unfortunately
[07:36:42] <arthurvr> jQuery and jQuery UI are loaded though. Let me take a look at your code.
[07:37:06] <arthurvr> what element are you calling it on? (a line in the code could be a good hint ;))
[07:37:23] <PCatinean> I am calling it on a element that works with datepicker with no issues
[07:38:24] <arthurvr> what exactly is going wrong on that page? Be clear about what you want it to do and where in the code that should happen?
[07:38:54] <PCatinean> Now I see: http://hastebin.com/apeluxecuz.avrasm
[07:39:35] <PCatinean> arthurvr, I went to the jquery.ui site, selected only datepicker and slider plugin and included the .js file, nothing else
[07:39:41] <PCatinean> is that good enough?
[07:40:18] <arthurvr> the errors are totally unrelated to the files being loaded. A particular piece of code is calling non-existing functions.
[07:40:44] <PCatinean> basically: http://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.11.4&components=1110000000001000010001000000000000010
[07:41:19] <arthurvr> yeah okay but that has nothing to do with the errors you posted or what files are being loaded.
[07:42:33] <luaboy> what is $('#container') ?
[07:43:28] <arthurvr> luaboy: you mean what it means? Or what a container element is?
[07:45:56] <luaboy> arthurvr:$('#container').highcharts(){}
[07:46:06] <luaboy> arthurvr:report uncaught typeerror
[07:46:21] <luaboy> : undefined is not a function javascript function
[07:46:27] <PCatinean> brb
[07:48:32] <rZon> hello
[07:48:43] <rZon> what testing framework should I use to test my jQuery plugins?
[07:48:51] <arthurvr> rZon: depends on your needs.
[07:49:22] <PCatinean> arthurvr, that was me calling .datetimepicker()
[07:54:11] <PCatinean> arthurvr, now it's starting, no error but not slider either
[07:54:34] <luaboy> $('#container').highcharts(){} ,undefined is not a function
[07:55:06] <AtomicB0mB> Does anybody know a plugin that runs youtube's video on my site without Youtube logo and control and etc ? Like on this site: http://www.mustaxe.mx/ - you can see a small control set on the left bottom.
[07:55:32] <arthurvr> luaboy: If youâ€™re having issues with highcharts please post a reduced testcase.
[07:55:36] <arthurvr> !paste @ luaboy
[07:55:36] <b-ot> luaboy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:58:45] <luaboy> arthurvr:http://paste.ubuntu.com/10827208/
[07:58:53] <igyiguygyu> what's wrong with this? https://jsfiddle.net/0j2a5bcg/ I'm trying to change it's class as there is an file selected
[07:58:57] <luaboy> b-ot:http://paste.ubuntu.com/10827208
[07:59:27] <arthurvr> luaboy: thatâ€™s a paste, not a testcase, sorry. We need to be able to repro, the problem could as well be some piece of css or your markup.
[08:00:00] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: please include your markup.
[08:00:39] <igyiguygyu> here, https://jsfiddle.net/0j2a5bcg/1/
[08:00:46] <igyiguygyu> whoops, https://jsfiddle.net/0j2a5bcg/2/
[08:01:07] <luaboy> arthurvr: what is the $('#container') meaning?
[08:01:22] <arthurvr> luaboy: depends on your markup? Please post a testcase.
[08:01:46] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: okay thanks
[08:01:53] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: lemme take a look
[08:04:12] <wheeei> anyone using footables? Trying to get icon to show up..
[08:04:16] <PCatinean> arthurvr, what could be wrong if there is no error whatsoever but just the simple datepicker comes up?
[08:04:40] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: the addition of the class works fine for me. Maybe the troubles you have are caused by other pieces of the code?
[08:05:46] <PCatinean> I cannot find ui_tpicker_minute_slider in the source means it's not loaded or something
[08:05:51] <igyiguygyu> Hmm, it doesnt really add anything to it :/
[08:06:22] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: the class gets added for me, although please note that windows fires these events on slightly different moments.
[08:06:34] <arthurvr> Also a class is visibly not vissible as long as you donâ€™t style it.
[08:07:15] <PCatinean> damn this is the most irritating shit ever
[08:07:16] <igyiguygyu> I get that, but I'm just looking at the source - i click on upload file, and nothing really adds to the class=" " parameter
[08:07:49] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: the source will never change. Only the DOM changes.
[08:10:36] <igyiguygyu> tried with .css()
[08:10:40] <igyiguygyu> didn't really add anything either
[08:11:19] <arthurvr> works for me => https://jsfiddle.net/0j2a5bcg/3/
[08:11:23] <arthurvr> what browser are you in?
[08:11:30] <arthurvr> there are some cross-browser diffs
[08:13:40] <igyiguygyu> Chrome
[08:13:46] <arthurvr> version and OS?
[08:13:47] <igyiguygyu> tried on safari too, same thing
[08:13:50] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m in chrome as well.
[08:13:52] <igyiguygyu> latest, and OSX
[08:14:38] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: totally works in both of those. Youâ€™re using some kind of fancy finder or chrome plugins?
[08:14:45] <igyiguygyu> No :D
[08:14:53] <PCatinean> can anyone help me debug this issue?
[08:15:09] <arthurvr> PCatinean: please post a reduced test case instead of a whole site.
[08:15:42] <igyiguygyu> yeah it seems to work on jsfiddle, not sure why it doesnt work in my code
[08:15:55] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: haha you didnâ€™t even test it lol
[08:16:21] <igyiguygyu> No, well I tested it as I pasted it, sorry, haven't slept all night :D
[08:16:32] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: try to port your code over to jsfiddle, test it, if it works try to delete code, test again, delete more, â€¦
[08:16:45] <arthurvr> Only right way of making fiddle meant for debugging
[08:16:52] <arthurvr> likely the problem is somewhere else
[08:17:08] <arthurvr> for example, another even handler screwing it up, a plugin, ...
[08:17:16] <arthurvr> ~event handler
[08:18:13] <igyiguygyu> Hmm, maybe, lemme try to do elimination on elements to debug it
[08:18:16] <igyiguygyu> thanks for your help tho
[08:18:38] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: yup. Come back when youâ€™ve got the problem reduced and I can take another look.
[08:18:48] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: might as well be in your views
[08:19:00] <arthurvr> I saw you was using php
[08:19:07] <bepolite> Hello
[08:19:15] <arthurvr> hey bepolite
[08:19:19] <arthurvr> howâ€™s your day
[08:19:20] <bepolite> Are class selectors slower than id selectors in javascript
[08:19:23] <bepolite> great arthurvr
[08:19:34] <arthurvr> depends on how you use them. Generally not.
[08:19:53] <arthurvr> generally you shouldnâ€™t care I mean
[08:20:01] <arthurvr> but idâ€™s are just a few operations faster.
[08:20:34] <igyiguygyu> shit, something was overriding the code and now it works
[08:20:46] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: thatâ€™s perfectly possible.
[08:20:53] <igyiguygyu> still don't know what was causing that but changing around the order it somehow started to work
[08:21:03] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: was it a third party plugin maybe?
[08:21:08] <bepolite> arthurvr: but nested selectors will be slower right? eg $('.connection-request-table tbody tr')
[08:21:15] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: you might want to report a bug over there.
[08:21:20] <igyiguygyu> Not sure, I'm on a framework and there's all sorts of stuff in one .js file
[08:22:02] <arthurvr> bepolite: they will, but in your day-to-day coding you should care about the important stuff, not micro-optimizations like this.
[08:22:19] <bepolite> lol
[08:22:23] <bepolite> thanks arthurvr
[08:22:28] <arthurvr> If there is only one element on the page that needs that id/class just use an id.
[08:22:50] <arthurvr> bepolite: ^ I think thatâ€™s something you can try to do but for the rest you shouldnâ€™t really care
[08:22:50] <PCatinean> how do I reference jquery ui online?
[08:22:54] <arthurvr> bepolite: youâ€™re welcome!
[08:22:56] <PCatinean> so I can make a blasted jf fiddle
[08:23:10] <arthurvr> PCatinean: the drop down menu on the left
[08:23:45] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: having many stuff together as a big chunk is generally bad practice.
[08:24:14] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: all good application development frameworks have ways to handle that kind of stuff.
[08:24:56] <bepolite>  PCatinean you will need to load it as an external resource i think
[08:24:57] <igyiguygyu> Yeah, well i've heard that. if I would be capable of writing a full framework, I would probably take that in consideration, but that was up to these guys - http://materializecss.com/images/materialize_team.jpeg
[08:25:01] <igyiguygyu> :D
[08:25:15] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: lol
[08:25:44] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: just use decent frameworks lol
[08:25:46] <PCatinean> I did
[08:26:01] <arthurvr> PCatinean: then the problem is likely to be your code
[08:26:15] <igyiguygyu> actually this framework in overall ranks in my top 3
[08:26:25] <igyiguygyu> It's super simple to use, has a lot of functions dumbed down to simple calls
[08:27:03] <igyiguygyu> Doesn't have unnecessary stuff. For example zurb foundation is like black hole. There's too much of everything
[08:27:19] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: oh letâ€™s not discuss that lol :) I have strong thoughts about frameworks like this (same thing about front-end frameworks) but that has been discussed enough.
[08:27:30] <arthurvr> Also, hey, itâ€™s #jquery lol
[08:27:35] <igyiguygyu> yeah :D no offtopic
[08:27:56] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: I love off topic, but not that far lol
[08:28:09] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: should stay interesting for the other 700 people.
[08:28:17] <igyiguygyu> yeah :D
[08:29:04] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: also this are the kind of things that have been discussed enough lol :) I implemented todo apps in ~50 frameworks and just have strong thoughs about all of them lollipop
[08:29:12] <arthurvr> moving on lol
[08:31:19] <PCatinean> I've spent three hours on this garbage
[08:31:25] <PCatinean> and now 20 minutes just for a damn fiddle
[08:31:54] <arthurvr> PCatinean: if you need to spend 20 mins doing a fiddle (by defenition an
[08:32:02] <bepolite> bassically, I
[08:32:12] <arthurvr> easy testcase) youâ€™d better learn to use jsfiddle lol
[08:32:22] <arthurvr> and I like having sentences on two lines!
[08:32:23] <arthurvr> lol
[08:32:37] <bepolite> I'm trying to attach an event to all the <td> in a table.
[08:32:43] <bepolite> I have the following code http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/j13ntg2h/
[08:32:53] <arthurvr> bepolite: lemme take a look
[08:33:06] <bepolite> arthurvr: Thats what I'm trying to optimize
[08:33:15] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[08:33:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:33:22] <arthurvr> yah lol
[08:33:28] <robertmaxrees> that's optimal imo.
[08:33:30] <robertmaxrees> generall.
[08:33:49] <arthurvr> yup
[08:34:10] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use .attr() when reading data attributes - use .data() instead.
[08:34:35] <arthurvr> sure thing
[08:34:42] <bepolite> Nice
[08:34:50] <robertmaxrees> also also using an IIFE within that function is totally unnecessary - you're just adding an extra scope to the chain for no reason.
[08:34:52] * bepolite reads on delegated listeners
[08:35:13] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events - it seems like a lot of info but it's actually pretty simple.
[08:35:16] <PCatinean> http://jsfiddle.net/q7rx4jx1/1/
[08:35:24] <sergez> hello is Arthur still around?
[08:35:31] <arthurvr> sttt... tell him I'm away.
[08:35:35] <arthurvr> hey sergez what's up?
[08:35:49] <PCatinean> datepicker works, datetimepicker doesn't
[08:36:00] <sergez> hey ma friend. You've got ten minutes?
[08:36:17] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean i'm getting a 403 for that JS file.
[08:36:23] <arthurvr> no but the rest of the channel has perhaps? Whatâ€™s your problem?
[08:37:01] <PCatinean> which one?
[08:37:13] <sergez> performance troubles so as previous time you got my code to perform 900% better I though I'd ask you?
[08:37:16] <bepolite> robertmaxrees: please what is IIFE?
[08:37:18] <arthurvr> haha did I
[08:37:18] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean all the ones hosted at trentrichardson.com it looks like.
[08:37:31] <PCatinean> all work for me
[08:37:37] <robertmaxrees> bepolite that thing where you did (function addEventListeners(){}());
[08:37:37] <sacho_> bepolite, it's a googleable term
[08:37:42] <arthurvr> bepolite: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[08:37:50] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean probably because you're authorized for those resources.
[08:40:23] <jen__> I am building a responsive site.  Any ideas how to use JQuery to make this animation with popups? http://www.alphalofts.com/loft-location-ny-nj-mobile/index
[08:40:54] <PCatinean> now what?
[08:41:06] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean we can't troubleshoot if we canot access the files on your server.
[08:41:43] <arthurvr> jen__: only for me or the most janky site ever?
[08:42:00] <jen__> janky?
[08:42:05] <jen__> clarify arthurvr
[08:42:26] <arthurvr> yeah jank as in not performant terribly looking
[08:42:27] <arthurvr> http://jankfree.org/
[08:42:39] <PCatinean> not my server
[08:42:45] <PCatinean> external resource
[08:42:47] <arthurvr> jen__: it goes like crazy for me
[08:42:49] <jen__> cmon nowâ€¦I built that about 8 years ago.
[08:42:56] <decx> look at the source, the inline top/left styles never stop changing
[08:43:14] <arthurvr> jen__: If my mac pro doesnâ€™t run this with ease it 8 years ago was the reason computers crashed lol
[08:43:19] <jen__> hence a total rebuild guys
[08:43:26] <arthurvr> I dunno why itâ€™s that janky
[08:43:28] <robertmaxrees> jen__ they're not being mean - just honest.
[08:43:35] <arthurvr> anyways, moving on lol
[08:43:37] <jen__> ya yaâ€¦got it
[08:43:38] <arthurvr> sure thing
[08:43:56] <decx> have a set of coordinates, apply them to your elements and let css3 take care of animating it
[08:44:07] <jen__> I am using Bootstrap framework. I have the map but needed ideas about placement of dot and interactivitiy
[08:44:26] <jen__> i was thinking in that direction
[08:44:42] <arthurvr> 11 frames per second lollipop. anyways, what was the problem lol?
[08:44:48] <arthurvr> lemme look into it
[08:45:28] <jen__> decx: i could easily just use a gif animation
[08:45:31] <jen__> :)
[08:45:45] <arthurvr> jen__: sound like a good idea decx
[08:45:49] <jen__> that way the IE folks donâ€™t stare at a blank screen
[08:46:04] <decx> old ie users just dont get animation
[08:46:07] <jen__> ok, so gif animationâ€¦now onto coordinates
[08:46:15] <jen__> even with a gif?
[08:46:45] <decx> why have an extra request when a pulsating circle could be done with a simple css element
[08:47:21] <arthurvr> exactly
[08:47:32] <arthurvr> expect if you really care about old ie monsters
[08:47:39] <bepolite> Okay after doing some reading, I have this http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/kLpydff5/
[08:47:49] <arthurvr> where gifs wouldnâ€™t be a good solution too
[08:48:08] <robertmaxrees> bepolite it looks like those both do the exact same thing, yeah?
[08:48:11] <arthurvr> bepolite: why two handlers?
[08:48:21] <bepolite> No sorry the functions should be diffrerent
[08:48:39] <bepolite> And I have like 5 rows. Dhoudl I have to do 5 handlers?
[08:48:53] <robertmaxrees> why should the handlers be different?
[08:49:00] <bepolite> Something like this http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/kLpydff5/1/
[08:49:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[08:49:24] <bepolite> the handlers are on separate rows
[08:49:33] <bepolite> s/on/for
[08:49:37] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you could probably abstract out doc_summary_page/second_function better.
[08:49:42] <robertmaxrees> that way you have one handler.
[08:49:56] <decx> these do the same thing?
[08:50:05] <bepolite> decx: No they do different things
[08:50:22] <robertmaxrees> it looks like they do the same thing up until a final function call.
[08:50:28] <bepolite> Also, I would need to write like 3 more handlers for  the other cells
[08:50:42] <decx> have a conditional inside a single handler to call the appropriate function
[08:50:47] <bepolite> The final function is what really matters anyways
[08:51:08] <robertmaxrees> use that function as your point of abstraction, not the handler.
[08:51:22] <bepolite> I can't touch the function however
[08:51:28] <bepolite> That is out of the question
[08:51:33] <robertmaxrees> then proxy through something else?
[08:51:48] <bepolite> proxy?
[08:52:23] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[08:52:45] <bepolite> thanks :)
[08:54:37] <robertmaxrees> basically, something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kLpydff5/2/
[08:55:18] <robertmaxrees> obviously that won't work - i don't have your markup in front of me, but this way you bind a single listener and pass through to another function that takes care of the rest.
[08:57:16] <bepolite> I understand robertmaxrees
[08:57:36] <Dorf> is there a way to make something fire whenever something with a class enters a range?
[08:57:41] <Dorf> http://codepen.io/jddoesdev/pen/dPxPrd is what i have so far, but it only works on the first one
[09:01:31] <decx> what do you mean first one?
[09:01:35] <decx> first .block?
[09:02:12] <decx> either way you want to minimize the dom lookups and methods that you use inside the scroll event because it happens so often and will make your page sluggish
[09:03:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.  also, stuff like $('.block').offset().top only returns the first one, not all of them.
[09:03:33] <decx> here's an old example that might help http://jsfiddle.net/decx/br2L9n8j/3/
[09:04:22] <decx> wait that's for something else ^^
[09:04:38] <Dorf> okay
[09:04:44] <decx> the $.map for offsets before the scroll would be the same though
[09:04:48] <bepolite> robertmaxrees:  basically, my final code will be something like http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/kLpydff5/4/
[09:05:17] <bepolite> I have to determine the <td> which is been clicked by using its class attribute
[09:10:36] <bepolite>  /join #java
[09:10:53] <bepolite> mistake
[09:11:21] <decx> wouldnt it be ##java anyway?
[09:11:30] <decx> or does oracle run an official channel?
[09:13:00] <robertmaxrees> # goes to ## in that case.
[09:13:26] <bepolite> hmm robertmaxrees did you have to chance to go through my revision?
[09:13:30] <bepolite> http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/kLpydff5/4/
[09:13:51] <bepolite> The attribute used to distinguish the functions is a class
[09:13:51] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[09:14:10] <decx> if it works it works?!
[09:14:46] <bepolite> hahaha
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees> haha
[09:14:54] <bepolite> decx: not the best approach at times
[09:15:01] <robertmaxrees> (he's joking)
[09:15:19] <decx> we're not landing a space shuttle here
[09:15:38] <bepolite> hahahah
[09:18:51] <robertmaxrees> lol it's always weird when somebody bounces between two channels for the same question.
[09:20:17] <bepolite> hmm robertmaxrees  you wasted some time to reply. I taught you were gone
[09:20:19] <Omar-> http://imgur.com/a/DS27V?gallery lol
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:20:31] <robertmaxrees> i replied like immediately.
[09:21:17] <bepolite> robertmaxrees: You replied when I asked the second time
[09:21:31] <bepolite> the first time, you didn't reply.
[09:21:41] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  so what's up?
[09:21:42] <shkurata> Ñ…Ð¸ Ð°Ð»Ð»
[09:21:46] <shkurata> hi all
[09:21:53] <decx> that's it robertmaxrees, i will have to confiscate your "best support in channel" badge
[09:21:53] <robertmaxrees> (there's an entire channel that can help you here bepolite :) )_
[09:22:07] <bepolite> ):
[09:24:00] <shkurata> I have a problem with jquery autocomplete widget
[09:24:07] <shkurata> can somebody help me
[09:24:13] <bepolite> yes shkurata
[09:24:15] <bepolite> just ask
[09:24:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:24:26] <shkurata> where can I paste the code
[09:24:31] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ shkurata
[09:24:32] <b-ot> shkurata: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:25:21] <shkurata> http://jsfiddle.net/yq2j4zxb/
[09:25:34] <robertmaxrees> there's a javascript pane.
[09:25:50] <shkurata> when I use the array availableCities
[09:25:54] <shkurata> it works
[09:26:09] <shkurata> bot when I use the array newCities
[09:26:16] <robertmaxrees> $("#searcher").autocomplete({ runs before the ajax completes.
[09:26:16] <shkurata> it doesn't
[09:26:40] <decx> that's because autocomplete is done before done() is done
[09:26:48] <decx> fundamentals of async
[09:26:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yq2j4zxb/2/
[09:27:49] <robertmaxrees> or just http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yq2j4zxb/3/
[09:27:54] <shkurata> and gow do I fif that
[09:28:10] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddles i've shared :)
[09:28:17] <robertmaxrees> moved the autocomplete into the .done() callback.
[09:28:25] <decx> or put the ajax in the source function
[09:28:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is the smarter choice.
[09:28:41] <decx> that'll allow to send data
[09:29:12] <shkurata> ok
[09:29:19] <shkurata> I understood
[09:29:22] <shkurata> thank you
[09:29:30] <shkurata> I'm new to jquery
[09:32:27] <decx> if i remember right you dont even need ajax
[09:32:41] <decx> just the endpoint in source
[09:37:18] <shkurata> it is just for test
[09:37:23] <shkurata> I know
[09:41:11] <Dorf> decx: mind checking to see if i'm on the right track?
[09:42:02] <decx> what was that about?
[09:42:09] <decx> .block scroll?
[09:42:18] <Dorf> yeah
[09:42:27] <Dorf> http://jsfiddle.net/qkm10nrx/
[09:43:39] <hotnikks> how can i replace the entire contents of a page AFTER a .get request has fully returned? i'm using document.open();document.write(resp);document.close() right now but the resp is quite large and the page is blank/white for several seconds before it gets replaced. we're working on optimizing the response itself but until that's optimal, i need to not show white :/
[09:43:46] <topdownjimmy> Anybody know why the second control slide doesn't "activate" when advancing the main carousel? http://codepen.io/jsit/pen/azeGRB
[09:43:56] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ hotnikks
[09:43:56] <b-ot> hotnikks: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:44:01] <hotnikks> k
[09:44:17] <robertmaxrees> hotnikks it sounds like you want 2 things that you can't have.
[09:44:24] <decx> when is f supposed to show up againa after it's scrolled by already Dorf?
[09:44:31] <hotnikks> lol
[09:44:37] <hotnikks> what do i want that i cant have?
[09:45:00] <Dorf> decx: once one of the .block elements pass it, it's supposed to reappear
[09:45:20] <robertmaxrees> hotnikks it sounds like you want something to happen before the .get() finishes, but not.
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> like, you want both.
[09:45:30] <hotnikks> well
[09:45:38] <hotnikks> i want nothing to happen until it finishes
[09:45:41] <decx> so it'll fade out when it reaches the top of the blcok and fade in when it leaves it
[09:45:42] <hotnikks> like i want teh background to stay the same
[09:45:56] <robertmaxrees> .get().done(function() { /* your code here */ })
[09:45:58] <Dorf> i think it's going to take some more complex logic than what i have, but if i'm going down the wrong road i'd like to know before i get too far
[09:46:05] <hotnikks> yes i did that
[09:46:15] <hotnikks> ill get an example posted soon
[09:46:29] <Dorf> decx: that's right.  pretty much if #f occupies the same space as a .block, #f needs to go away
[09:47:02] <decx> map your coordinates into a single array and have a simple collision detection
[09:47:09] <decx> or object*
[09:52:01] <robertmaxrees> back.
[09:54:00] <robertmaxrees> hotnikks btw don't use document.open() / document.write() / document.close()
[09:54:03] <hotnikks> k
[09:54:12] <hotnikks> is there a better way to replace contents?
[09:54:21] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jqueruy, .replace()
[09:54:23] <hotnikks> basically i need to first make a call to get a url witha  token in it
[09:54:28] <hotnikks> yes im using jquery
[09:54:51] <robertmaxrees> $('#someTarget').replaceWith(data);
[09:55:07] <hotnikks> oh i need to replace entire contents of page with an html5 game
[09:55:24] <robertmaxrees> when you say "entire contents of page", do you mean the body, or literally everything?
[09:55:31] <hotnikks> everything, header, etc.
[09:55:33] <robertmaxrees> if the former, that makes no sense.
[09:55:39] <hotnikks> let me explain
[09:55:42] <robertmaxrees> why use ajax at all in that case?
[09:55:45] <hotnikks> here's why
[09:57:26] <hotnikks> client logs into angularjs app, app authenticates against spring security rest and saves bearer token in sessionstorage. when client gets around to playing the game (entirely separate app hosted in tomcat), he clicks button to load /play. that page looks for session stored token, makes request to tomcat server w/token as credential to authenticate to diff system and tomcat returns a (very large) SPA that includes all sorts of JS, CSS, HTML, etc. we're workin
[09:57:32] <robertmaxrees> that cut off btw
[09:57:33] <hotnikks> well it can take as long as it *has* to
[09:57:43] <hotnikks> but while it's loading, want to display some spinner
[09:57:53] <hotnikks> or something that lets user know it's coming (if they arne't watching chrome network or timeline)
[09:58:27] <hotnikks> the /play page actually makes two calls, first is to get the "play" token from the server, and second is to load the game w/said token
[09:58:54] <hotnikks> soon as i document.open the page is blown away, replaced by white, and on a slow link it'll be 20s before you actually render the page
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to direct the user to the SPA and kick the loading screen off there - you're overcomplicating it now by hacking in the document.write() stuff.
[09:59:33] <robmal> That's the dumbest idea i heard this week, good job :-) My suggestion is even dumber - use frames.
[09:59:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:00:17] <robmal> robertmaxrees: Isn't that what frames were designed for?
[10:00:35] <robertmaxrees> they're also outdated.
[10:00:43] <hotnikks> robmal; we didn't write the game itself
[10:00:43] <robertmaxrees> if they want to build an SPA, build an SPA.
[10:00:51] <robertmaxrees> they want a weird hybrid.
[10:00:53] <hotnikks> we wrote the portal around it
[10:01:06] <robertmaxrees> you basically can't have what you want without modifying the game itself to include the loading screen.
[10:01:08] <hotnikks> developers are working on concatenating and minifying the roughly 30+ js files
[10:01:13] <hotnikks> yeah
[10:01:17] <hotnikks> think that's where we're headed
[10:01:27] <robertmaxrees> don't hack around that - fix that problem instead.
[10:01:29] <hotnikks> k
[10:02:18] <robmal> robertmaxrees: They're not outdated, they were just used the wrong way for a very long time.
[10:02:39] <robmal> hotnikks: For now try using frames :-)
[10:02:43] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame
[10:02:51] <robertmaxrees> "This feature has been removed from the Web. Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Do not use it in old or new projects. Pages or Web apps using it may break at any time."
[10:02:57] <hotnikks> hehe
[10:03:14] <robertmaxrees> frames are an inappropriate solution, especially in this case.  if you want an SPA, make an SPA.
[10:04:09] <robmal> But, but, when the frame for the game is empty it can point to a 'loading' page/image and when the response loads it can just show there. What's wrong with that?
[10:04:19] <hotnikks> part of the reason it was done this way was so user could hit refresh button in app and not have some ridiculous tomcat-generated url, but i could really just combat that from the IT side (e.g., apache httpd or nginx url rewriting)
[10:04:20] <robertmaxrees> frames are deprecated.
[10:04:48] <robmal> Ok, so find a better solution that works.
[10:04:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:04:58] <robertmaxrees> like finish the SPA to include a loading screen.
[10:05:02] <robertmaxrees> like i suggested.
[10:05:06] <robmal> ;-) Except that.
[10:05:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:05:33] <robmal> hotnikks said it will take a long time, can you find a solution that works now and doesn't use frames?
[10:05:59] <robertmaxrees> and detract resources from getting it done the right way?
[10:06:02] <hotnikks> it's jsut a BEAST of an app. i think im going to try the rewrite solution for now
[10:06:03] <robertmaxrees> that seems strange to me.
[10:10:31] <IceTrAiN> perhaps I'm misunderstanding something, but why not just display a loading gif(or whatever you desire) until the game is done loading, and don't push it/replace to the page until it's done loading?
[10:10:40] <hotnikks> that's what i was trying to do
[10:10:52] <hotnikks> i honestly think it's the page itself
[10:10:54] <hotnikks> is so big/slow
[10:10:59] <hotnikks> that it's just downloading and rendering
[10:11:11] <hotnikks> so to robert's point, need to optimize it
[10:11:29] <hotnikks> hell it loads like 45 separate js files in the head.. gross
[10:11:33] <hotnikks> sorry, GROSS :)
[10:12:21] <hotnikks> basic concat didnt work because of app-specific nuances, so was looking at alternatives before digging in and figuring out what they did that prevents concat working properly
[10:12:25] <IceTrAiN> it sounded like your main issue is that it was 'displaying it' before it was fully loaded, which (from my basic understanding) isn't supposed to happen if you're ajax'ing appropriately
[10:12:39] <robertmaxrees> they're not ajaxing properly is part of the problem.
[10:12:40] <hotnikks> well it may have been loaded, but not rendered
[10:12:50] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to nuke the entirety of the page and rebuild it within the same window.
[10:13:04] <hotnikks> yeah it's not a standard ajax use case, it's a hacjk
[10:13:08] <hotnikks> s/hacjk/hack
[10:13:15] <hotnikks> trying to fix root of issue now, thanks guys
[10:15:27] <IceTrAiN> lol @ 45 js files
[10:15:35] <hotnikks> it's a HUGE app
[10:15:42] <hotnikks> with no build/load optimization
[10:15:43] <hotnikks> (obviously)
[10:16:56] <hotnikks> just by moving those to end of file the white page disappears
[10:17:17] <decx> Dorf: http://jsfiddle.net/qkm10nrx/1/
[10:18:08] <Dorf> holy shit decx, thank you.
[10:18:30] <decx> had to figure it out -.-
[10:19:21] <Dorf> you did a lot faster than i could have... believe me, i've been trying
[10:19:43] <decx> it's still a hacky solution
[10:20:04] <Dorf> better than what i was coming up with
[10:20:07] <Dorf> thank you again
[10:20:20] <decx> exiting the loop when it's actually colliding isnt bulletproof
[10:20:25] <decx> but it works
[10:20:27] <decx> ^^
[10:22:59] <IceTrAiN> I think dorf is making an ovaltine decoder ring.
[10:23:12] <Dorf> damnit.  you figured me out
[10:23:24] <IceTrAiN> :)
[10:23:32] <decx> ovaltine huh, that's gold IceTrAiN, GOLD
[10:23:54] <Dorf> actually, my boss wants to essentially copy wired's design, so i have to figure out how they do what they do.
[10:24:05] <Dorf> i am not okay with this
[10:24:33] <wheeei> how do I target a click event on a dropdown ?
[10:24:45] <robertmaxrees> use a change event instead :)
[10:26:29] <IceTrAiN> Dorf: did you use a generator for the filler text, or is that from your own personal diary? :)
[10:26:39] <Dorf> hipster ipsum
[10:27:12] <Dorf> i usually bounce between that, lebowski ipsum, and fillerama
[10:27:18] <decx> hm then you should've used coffeescript :(
[10:27:19] <IceTrAiN> awesome :)
[10:27:22] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[10:27:23] <robertmaxrees> ew ew ew.
[10:27:27] <decx> ^^ /s
[10:28:24] <wheeei> robertmaxrees ah okay, should I .find the select ?
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you can get it however you'd like.
[10:28:51] <wheeei> $("#mydiv").find("select").on("change", function() something like this robertmaxrees ?
[10:29:11] <robertmaxrees> or $('#mydiv select'); or a delegated version or or or.
[10:29:58] <Dorf> ha
[10:30:18] <wheeei> hmpf cant get it to work, guess I have to make a fiddle :P
[10:30:20] <Dorf> i almost put lebowski ipsum on our staging server
[10:30:31] <Dorf> i caught it before anyone else saw it.
[10:31:19] <Dorf> the <h1> tag was THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS, LARRY!
[10:31:32] <robertmaxrees> wheeei http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zygkkryL/
[11:18:56] <ehlovader> robertmaxrees I found out what the problem was with datatables yesterday... https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/comment/73996/#Comment_73996
[11:19:09] <ehlovader> the plugin I was using for bootstrap3 stuff was old and not working
[11:19:28] <ehlovader> they integrated it with another plugin, one that actually replaces the css of the default
[11:20:26] <Dorf> i'm trying to set a fixed position based on other elements in the page.  i have var blockTop = $("#main").offset().top; and $("#element").css({'position': 'fixed', 'top' : blockTop}); and it's giving me some huge number
[11:20:32] <Dorf> it should only be about 300
[11:20:50] <Dorf> i'm getting 850+
[11:22:16] <robmal> Because #main is ~850px from top, try position()
[11:24:36] <Dorf> $('#main').offset().top; returned 238 in the console
[11:27:10] <tirengarfio> why is not working here fancybox? http://jsfiddle.net/ocsfpmdj/
[11:27:32] <tirengarfio> I have loaded fancybox as external resources on the left panel
[11:34:23] <notchris> I have an iframe that Iâ€™m replacing the content of
[11:34:42] <notchris> I want to grab links and their onclick attrâ€™s and make a list
[11:34:43] <notchris> http://rocketb.in/paste/oR50x6
[11:55:59] <IceTrAiN> tirengarfio: you're not targetting your element correctly
[11:56:24] <IceTrAiN> there is nothing with a class of "fancybox".  either add that class to your element, or target the id instead
[12:02:06] <Kartagis> why would http://paste.debian.net/166980/ not work?
[12:09:48] <supsup> anyone know why in IE9 the myFormTarget Length = 0?  in current IE/IE10/chrome/firefox it's length is 1.  http://jsfiddle.net/grp20h52/1/
[12:14:35] <supsup> weird it's because of the paragraph tags
[12:15:47] <testerbit> I'm using data tables plugin and I have a bug where when an element in a specific row is selected it randomly reorders some rows only when another column is in ascending order. How can I debug this?
[12:16:02] <supsup> make jsfiddle
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> supsup are you verifying that in actual 9, or 9 emulation mode?
[12:23:01] <supsup> i've only checked emulation mode but have reports from real ie9
[12:23:22] <supsup> i think it's related tot his bug i found http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12895
[12:23:49] <supsup> guessing because it's wrapped in <p> tags and then the UL inside of it is list-style that breaks the 'phrasing content'
[12:23:51] <supsup> rule
[12:23:56] <supsup> and breaks IE9
[12:23:59] <cj> I'm looking for a widget similar to a <select multiple/>, but with two columns and a related value in a single-select element in the right column
[12:24:01] <supsup> since as he says it works in every other case
[12:24:06] <robertmaxrees> supsup that's actually not a jquery bug fwiw.
[12:24:15] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that's part of your problem.
[12:24:25] <cj> I could implement this with a table and click event listerns on the td elements, but that's a lot of work
[12:24:29] <supsup> i mean it's weird that it only happens in IE9
[12:24:32] <cj> I figured someone else has probably already done this.
[12:24:37] <supsup> no one responded to his comment about it
[12:24:48] <robertmaxrees> supsup the bug was closed as "not a bug"
[12:24:57] <supsup> yah i mean it's weird tho right
[12:25:01] <supsup> that it happens only in IE9
[12:25:04] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[12:25:19] <robertmaxrees> it's invalid markup.  each browser treats invalid markup differently.
[12:25:41] <supsup> yeah
[12:25:55] <supsup> I've used UL and LI in P tags lots tho....
[12:26:01] <supsup> never knew it was improper.
[12:26:13] <robertmaxrees> p tags are for paragraphs.
[12:27:05] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content for children that can be under a <p>
[12:27:08] <supsup> heh it appears so ;-0
[12:27:20] <supsup> yep i read it because of that bug
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> again, not a bag :)
[12:27:54] <supsup> i've been given lots of Html in the past with <ul/li...etc in p tags a lot too from 3rd parties in future i'm gonna send that shit back and tell them to not be abusing my phrasing content like that
[12:33:11] <tirengarfio> IceTrAiN, both anchor tags has "fancybox" class : http://jsfiddle.net/s68hepb9/3/ should I add that class somewhere else?
[12:41:12] <IceTrAiN> tirengarfio: it seems to be working fine to me in that new fiddle.  or is that not the desired effect?
[13:02:37] <TeddyMurray> how would i $.ajax a .webm video file and place it into the video element? its a blob
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> you can't iirc.
[13:03:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't support binary data type requests last i heard.
[13:05:13] <mrkus> hi
[13:05:24] <mrkus> I'm setting the cursor image using jQuery and I'm having some issues. I use $("canvas").css( 'cursor', 'url(assets/media/cursors/handPoint2.png),auto' ); and it works but it keeps changing to the OS cursor all the time...
[13:06:36] <markus21> I'm setting the cursor image using jQuery and I'm having some issues. I use $("canvas").css( 'cursor', 'url(assets/media/cursors/handPoint2.png),auto' ); and it works but it keeps changing to the OS cursor all the time...
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:08:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have an example we can see, markus21?
[13:09:13] <markus21> online?
[13:09:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure how we'd see it otherwise.
[13:09:36] <IceTrAiN> floppy disk?
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:09:42] <markus21> ok I can upload it
[13:09:49] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be awesome
[13:09:50] <markus21> well I could paste code lol
[13:12:52] <bepolite> floppy disk
[13:12:54] <bepolite> lol
[13:13:45] <markus21> h/o lol
[13:14:19] <bepolite> Such answers make me wonder if you guys had already prepared the answer  waiting for the question
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> not in this case.
[13:14:41] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean what IceTrAiN said haha
[13:14:53] <bepolite> yep what IceTrAiN  said
[13:15:07] <IceTrAiN> unlike floppy drives, I'm actually just that quick.
[13:24:23] <misutowolf> Got a question, folks.  If I am iterating through an array and doing a series of AJAX calls based on the rows of stuff (from a textarea), how should I go about storing the results of the calls coming back?
[13:24:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> use promises instead.
[13:25:26] <misutowolf> I see.  I've never tried using promises before.
[13:26:32] <misutowolf> Is this the .done() stuff that the documentation mentions?
[13:26:40] <robertmaxrees> much more than that.
[13:26:53] <misutowolf> Well, it was just a small example.  I'm pretty new to AJAX stuff.
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5627301/923919 explains how you'd do it.
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> the basic gist is you need to create an array of promises and then use $.when.apply()
[13:30:23] <markus21> http://afternoon-falls-8978.herokuapp.com/
[13:30:38] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:30:47] <markus21> you'll se there's like a small cursor on the screen and then the big one that's the one being set via js. you don't need to play around the game lol.
[13:30:48] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[13:31:08] <robertmaxrees> we usuaully ask for a self-contained example.
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> paired down and all.
[13:31:33] <markus21> yeah that's going to be kind of hard at this point :/
[13:32:20] <markus21> the function where I set the cursor is here http://afternoon-falls-8978.herokuapp.com/js/kodable.js
[13:34:13] <IceTrAiN> markus21: why not just turn the default cursor off? is there a reason you need two?
[13:34:43] <markus21> i dont
[13:35:56] <markus21> the smaller blurry cursor you see there is HTML5, so it's an image.. i'll get rid of that when I get working the css cursor :)
[13:37:59] <IceTrAiN> markus21: what part isn't working then?
[13:38:49] <markus21> so the css mouse is set "correctly" by the function that calls $("body").css( 'cursor', 'url(assets/'+cursorUrl+'),auto' );
[13:39:13] <markus21> but a couple seconds after that the cursor just switches back to the default one
[13:41:00] <IceTrAiN> it doesn't change back for me (using chrome on win 8.1)
[13:41:10] <markus21> oh
[13:41:18] <markus21> I'm using mac but chrome too
[13:41:31] <IceTrAiN> the only time it switches is if i mouse down towards the bottom
[13:41:51] <markus21> well bc it's only set in the canvas
[13:42:05] <IceTrAiN> yep.  other than that it seems fine for me.
[13:43:41] <IceTrAiN> same thing in firefox
[13:44:27] <markus21> https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hsFmpyzpQOOjTLqkbXd2
[13:44:36] <markus21> this is what it does for me :/
[13:46:12] <DasLumberJackYa> Can anyone that has xp with Jquery UI Autocomplete tell me why my fields are not updating ->  http://pastie.org/10094676 <- I have tested the selectors in the console and they are returning proper jquery objects
[13:47:16] <IceTrAiN> markus21: hrmph..  after it changes back, have you inspected the page to confirm the css is still there?
[13:49:25] <markus21> i dont know
[13:49:34] <markus21> i can always try to set the cursor every like 1 second
[13:50:31] <IceTrAiN> markus21: you try it in safari?
[13:51:18] <markus21> yep
[13:51:24] <IceTrAiN> same thing?
[13:51:24] <markus21> it does the same
[13:51:48] <markus21> i'll try firefox to see if it's a mac thing or a webkit thing
[13:52:09] <markus21> yep same
[13:52:54] <JustPie_Work> Hey all. Is it possible to determine if an event is already bound on an element? ie: $(document).on('submit','form[name=cci_eventsbundle_pin]', function(e) {
[13:53:49] <notchris> Any idea why this would be showing all the dates a month ahead? http://rocketb.in/paste/k6rxEz
[13:54:45] <IceTrAiN> markus21: i think you have gremlins.  i just tested it on my mac (safari) and it works fine
[13:55:21] <markus21> so no clue why it doesnt work for me right?
[13:55:45] <IceTrAiN> has to be something else fudging it up... browser plugins maybe
[13:56:09] <markus21> in all three?
[13:56:16] <markus21> I dont know its like super weird
[13:56:51] <IceTrAiN> is the css still there when you inspect it?
[13:57:12] <markus21> i dont know how to check that
[13:58:25] <IceTrAiN> notchris: is index = 30?
[13:58:40] <markus21> ok yeah i know
[13:58:54] <IceTrAiN> markus21: in chrome, right click inspect element
[13:59:03] <markus21> yup
[13:59:07] <notchris> IceTrAiN: Maybe
[13:59:14] <notchris> How do I reset the index
[13:59:47] <markus21> body has style cursor: url(http://afternoon-falls-8978.herokuapp.com/assets/media/cursors//handPoint2.png), auto; even after it stops being shown
[14:00:03] <IceTrAiN> notchris: I don't know, you didn't provide the code for that part :P
[14:01:20] <notchris> IceTrAiN: Fixed by setting index = 0
[14:01:22] <notchris> :D
[14:01:55] <IceTrAiN> lol that was a random guess
[14:02:02] <IceTrAiN> semi-random anyway
[14:02:23] <notchris> jk
[14:02:26] <notchris> didnâ€™t fix it lol
[14:04:05] <IceTrAiN> notchris: try throwing it up on a jsfiddle so the problem can be reproduced
[14:04:42] <IceTrAiN> markus21: if you mouse to the bottom of the page, and then back up, does the finger come up again?
[14:05:27] <markus21> yes
[14:06:41] <IceTrAiN> JustPie_Work:  see if this helps: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/commandline-api#geteventlistenersobject
[14:08:53] <IceTrAiN> markus21: I'm guessing it disappears again when you do that?
[14:09:29] <markus21> yeah.. I mean it appears and after a couple of seconds it switches back to default
[14:10:22] <IceTrAiN> markus21: are you using any kinda fancy custom pointers or maybe screencapturing software?
[14:11:09] <markus21> fancy in what way? they're plain .png... I only used screencapturing for the video i showed you (quicktime)
[14:11:48] <IceTrAiN> i mean for osx..  trying to think of anything that would have an effect on the cursor outside of the browser
[14:12:05] <markus21> not that I know of really.. but apparently there is
[14:12:20] <IceTrAiN> we'll go with old faithful.  have you tried restarting? :)
[14:12:45] <markus21> haha... no
[14:13:12] <IceTrAiN> worth a shot at this point hehe
[14:14:06] <markus21> i tried at another mac and it worked now
[14:14:16] <markus21> it must be my mac that's fucking things up lol
[14:14:38] <markus21> see you in a bit
[14:21:16] <bewilled> Why doesn't a jquery mobile changePage method work when called inside a onreadystatechange of and XMLHttpRequest? http://pastebin.com/M66kySQU
[14:24:28] <bewilled> FYI pagecontainer change does not work as well
[14:24:38] <bewilled> using 1.4.5
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> any console errorr or anything?
[14:28:27] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, no, the redirect goes through but as a normal link. No loading animation or ajax page replacement
[14:29:01] <robertmaxrees> doesn't readystatechange technically fire on the document, no the XMLHttpRequest object?
[14:29:03] <robertmaxrees> hrmm..
[14:37:11] <neanderslob> hi everyone, I'm attempting to make a single page site that's made up of a series of sections (divs) I would like to make each section div to take up the full hight of the screen; can anyone recommend some documentation on how to do this or even the right search terms to use?
[14:43:44] <datanity> is it fair to say that using .closest here is faster
[14:43:45] <datanity> $(this).parents('.editPage_drawLayout_layoutBlock:first') vs $(this).closest('.editPage_drawLayout_layoutBlock')
[14:46:27] <neanderslob> the idea is similar to this plugin example: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage ( basically want to roll my own version of this)
[15:07:13] <datanity> pretty much, .closest(element) is faster than .parent(element:first-child)
[15:07:16] <datanity> or, am i wrong?
[15:07:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:08:19] <robertmaxrees> .parent() just goes to the parent node.
[15:08:50] <FrankD_> If I have two jQueryUI Tab instantiantions and I want to drag tabs between the containers how would I do that?
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and works its way through each ancestor until it finds the one that matches the selector.
[15:09:04] <FrankD_> anyone have a link to a fiddle with that or an example somewhere?
[15:09:47] <Jkwurry> well FrankD, I'm afraid what you're trying to do is impossible
[15:10:18] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it's impossible.  just very, very awkward to do.
[15:11:11] <FrankD_> why would it be impossible?g
[15:11:32] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of moving parts to both, FrankD_
[15:11:34] <FrankD_> ex: I have two "windows" (container divs), each with their own tab bar, I want to drag and drop tabs+content between them
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> getting that working is going to be pretty hard to do.
[15:12:55] <FrankD_> ok, what are the challenges?
[15:13:23] <robertmaxrees> you're basically going to have to re-init the tabs each time you drag/drop.
[15:13:43] <FrankD_> ok
[15:14:01] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, thanks for your help. I had to return false on the click event to cancel the hyperlink redirect when tapped.
[15:14:11] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, now everything is working fine
[15:14:15] <robertmaxrees> bewilled you should pass the event object instead.
[15:14:22] <robertmaxrees> and then run .preventDefault() against it.
[15:14:37] <robertmaxrees> but that explains why you were having problems.
[15:15:58] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, thanks, I'll make the change. I read somewhere that returning false was better. Thats the price you pay when trying to learn by doing
[15:16:26] <datanity> $("#start").parents("li:first");  has 27k ops/sec  $("#start").closest("li"); has 131k ops/sec
[15:16:51] <robertmaxrees> bewilled some people try to argue about that, but i'd say explicitly running e.preventDefault() when you want to prevent the default action of an event makes more sense :)
[15:17:06] <robertmaxrees> datanity yeah, parents() goes to the root node even after it's found a match.
[15:17:11] <robertmaxrees> .closest() stops.
[15:17:26] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you need, closest() is generally waht yuou want.
[15:53:31] <Jkwurry> hey all, if I use $(jqueryobject)[0] to convert to a DOM object, then I later want to "unwrap" it (remove the outer enclosing elements) is there a way to do that without switching it back to jquery?
[15:56:19] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> so you want a native DOM "unwrap"?
[15:57:13] <Jkwurry> yes if such a thing can be done...
[15:57:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery is written in javascript, so obviously it can be :)
[15:59:03] <robertmaxrees> kind of depends, though - mind setting up a simple example?
[15:59:19] <robertmaxrees> from your question, it looks like you might want the first child down from the current element.
[16:00:25] <Jkwurry> well if I have in my dom element <div> <p> test </p> </div> I'd like to end up with <p> test </p>
[16:04:21] <robertmaxrees> you could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bj2e9ef5/
[16:10:16] <Jkwurry> thanks I will attempt to apply that to what I'm doing
[16:15:10] <Jkwurry> is it normal to lose all of your jquery object's attributes when you convert it to a dom object?
[16:15:41] <robertmaxrees> you're not necessarily converting it.
[16:16:05] <robertmaxrees> $(someobject)[0] is just grabbing the 0th item out of the array-like jquery object.
[16:16:59] <Jkwurry> perhaps that's the error in my approach
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[16:18:02] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you trying to work with raw dom nodes in the first place?
[16:21:39] <Jkwurry> well I think you're correct that I'm approaching this wrong.  I'm trying to work with ui.item in the receive event of sortable in jquery
[16:22:00] <Jkwurry> by using ui.item[0].attributes I was able to traverse through the attributes...
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean enumerate through them?
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that?
[16:23:44] <Jkwurry> well I wanted to modify them and append them to another element elsewhere in the document
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you want .clone() instead
[16:25:27] <Jkwurry> ah I see
[16:25:40] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm confused about what you're trying to do.
[16:26:10] <Jkwurry> no I believe you're correct...
[16:26:13] <robertmaxrees> back up a step - what do you wnat to happen (without describing the code) when you drag an element.
[16:26:20] <robertmaxrees> *drop, rather.
[16:27:47] <Jkwurry> I want to remove it completely from where I dragged it from, and copy it over into a new container elsewhere with its attributes intact but modified
[16:28:02] <robertmaxrees> oh, no need for clone() then.
[16:31:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/droppable/#photo-manager check out how this works.
[16:33:22] <Jkwurry> that looks very relevant to what I'm trying to do here. I'm looking through the source now. thanks a lot for digging that up
[16:37:50] <_eddy> hi guys i am using pusher js for push notification to my phone. I have an issues with a function not working, please bear with me while i explaining "not working", what i mean is when alert like this http://kopy.io/voZA8 i get the message but when i try to put it in a new friendly way like this http://kopy.io/f3uYw it doesnt seem to show it in the message. the function does get called because i have tested it by adding alert("hello"); inside the
[16:37:50] <_eddy> addMessage function
[16:38:03] <_eddy> i dont know how to test the others
[16:39:03] <_eddy> any idea what the issue might be please
[16:39:47] <robertmaxrees> _eddy i'm lost.  http://kopy.io/voZA8 works but http://kopy.io/f3uYw doesn't?
[16:40:44] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: sorry what i mean is in the alert in the first kopy link doesnt alert the message but when i try to add it to a div
[16:40:51] <_eddy> it doesnt seem to display it
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> now i'm more lost haha.
[16:42:07] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: okay forget about the first kopy link
[16:42:17] <_eddy> look at the second one.
[16:43:16] <_eddy> why isn't data.text getting shows in the div with id message?
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah that's what you're asking.  and if you alert the text it's there?
[16:45:34] <_eddy> yea
[16:45:42] <_eddy> because it is not showing
[16:45:49] <robertmaxrees> right - one sec.
[16:46:27] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[16:46:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nxx9wq7t/ this works...
[16:46:45] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here then.
[16:46:46] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm....
[16:48:14] <_eddy> they is not difference
[16:48:16] <_eddy> no
[16:48:32] <_eddy> how do i add a link to a js script in jsfiddle?
[16:48:45] <robertmaxrees> external resources on the left.
[16:50:17] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: hmm they link is http://js.pusher.com/2.2/pusher.min.js
[16:50:37] <_eddy> but when i add it it becomes http://jsfiddle.net/js.pusher.com/2.2/pusher.min.js
[16:50:55] <_eddy> which doesnt exist so why does jsfiddle add his url?
[16:53:01] <robertmaxrees> https://js.pusher.com/2.2/pusher.min.js works
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nxx9wq7t/1/
[16:55:20] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/baako/drjsoot4/
[16:55:30] <_eddy> let me know when you have open it
[16:55:38] <robertmaxrees> it's open.
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't loaded there soooo.
[16:55:54] <_eddy> you need js
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> right, but addMessage requires jquery.
[16:56:15] <_eddy> did you need to alert?
[16:56:22] <_eddy> get*
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> i got an alert, yes.
[16:56:41] <_eddy> okay comment it out
[16:56:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/drjsoot4/1/ with jquery included.
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and try now.
[16:56:48] <_eddy> and uncomment the open one
[16:57:02] <_eddy> did you get it?
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ check the link i just shared.
[16:58:02] <robertmaxrees> this example will never work btw.
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> _eddy there's no #messages container to prepent anything to.
[16:58:55] <robertmaxrees> *prepend
[17:00:21] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: i have seen the link but when i sent the push notification it doesnt seem to display the message
[17:00:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/drjsoot4/4/
[17:00:54] <_eddy> sorry i put the wrong div
[17:01:37] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: what did you change?
[17:01:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/drjsoot4/5/ taking it even further.
[17:01:53] <robertmaxrees> in which one?
[17:02:19] <robertmaxrees> i added jquery to one of them and keep fixing up the functions.
[17:04:08] <_eddy> in this one http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/drjsoot4/1/
[17:04:44] <robertmaxrees> i added jquery
[17:05:05] <acidjazz> EDDY NO
[17:05:15] <Raiinb> should I hide or remove children
[17:05:24] <robertmaxrees> Raiinb depends - will you show them again?
[17:05:26] <acidjazz> Raiinb: what kind of father are you
[17:05:40] <Raiinb> robertmaxrees: that depends on the user
[17:05:48] <robertmaxrees> Raiinb generally, hide things.
[17:07:28] <Raiinb> .hideChildren>*{display:none}
[17:10:37] <coldhead> lol acidjazz
[17:19:29] <datanity> in this example, http://pastie.org/10095085, am I better off caching a selector called var $oPosition = $(oPosition);
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:19:54] <robertmaxrees> and/or $(oPosition).data('ds_position')
[17:20:19] <datanity> oh, interesting, yes
[17:20:36] <datanity> can i even cache $(oPosition).data('ds_position').position  , or does including that property at the end make it void
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> i was about to say - $(oPosition).data('ds_position').position makes the most sense.
[17:21:01] <datanity> thx for your help Robert
[17:21:08] <robertmaxrees> any time you find youirself repeating work, store it in a variable.
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> even when not repeating yourself, the nice name can be helpful.
[17:24:46] <datanity> http://pastie.org/10095091  for this, with $(oPosition) occuring twice... should I cache that too, in addition to the big long cache
[17:26:45] <datanity> like this: http://pastie.org/10095095#12
[17:28:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:28:52] <datanity> awesome, thanks for helping clarify that robert
[17:29:04] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:29:33] <robertmaxrees> similar could be done with $('.editPage_drawLayout_layoutBlock_TLWH .top', oPosition)
[17:32:11] <robertmaxrees> btw typeof(bUpdate) isn't a thing.
[17:32:50] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that whole line could be reduced down to just if (bUpdate)
[17:34:25] <robertmaxrees> http://pastie.org/10095104 with some cleanup.
[17:37:48] <datanity> another caching question... if you are using e.target a few times in a function, should you cache e.target too?
[17:38:58] <robertmaxrees> any time you're calling the same property of an object or a function with the same params, you should store that in a var, yeah.
[17:39:19] <robertmaxrees> especially when you're using jquery.
[17:39:25] <robertmaxrees> because $() is a semi-expensive operation.
[17:44:29] <datanity> for this example, if i wanted to cache $dom.widgetManager.allWidgets_UL.children("li"), would I do that above the switch statement?  http://pastie.org/10095113
[17:47:10] <robertmaxrees> ew.  and yes.
[17:48:34] <datanity> is the lookup time increased if you have to look deeper inside of a object.  Like, let's say you have a small object with $dom.elementA, $dom.elementA, $dom.elementA... is it fsater to look up that way than to have the same number of elements but in a nested object... $dom.groupA.subGroupA.elementA
[17:49:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> oh, deeply nested in the object?
[17:49:30] <datanity> yea, like, if you have 10 variables cached in an object...
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a little slower, but i wouldn't worry abou it.
[17:49:39] <datanity> kk
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> that's prematurely optimizing.
[18:15:55] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: hi its not showing the response on my phon
[18:17:10] <_eddy> http://kopy.io/lJDAz the div with class response_message does show but am missing the hello world text
[18:17:33] <_eddy> is they another option apart from prepend?
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:17:56] <robertmaxrees> there are tons of options.
[18:18:29] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: what i am getting is not a list
[18:18:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:19:08] <_eddy> its gonna be a command which get removed by jquery after 10 seconds
[18:19:27] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:20:02] <_eddy> doesnt matter am just tired
[18:20:08] <_eddy> been looking at this for a while
[18:20:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.  i have to go.  have fun.
[18:20:43] <jqueryius> http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/methods.html -> Can anyone explain what is meant by "The method wrapperClass can accepts a falsy value as second parameter. If so, it resets the class to its default." ?
[18:28:55] <jqueryius> if I want a jquery selector to select only the items with 2 classes, what do I do?
[18:29:38] <jqueryius> $('.x.y') ?
[18:41:33] <jqueryius> https://api.jquery.com/find/
[18:41:42] <jqueryius> if I know the parent class
[18:41:43] <jqueryius> ie. level-1
[18:41:57] <jqueryius> and all I know is that SOMEWHERE inside, is a class called item-3
[18:42:05] <jqueryius> how can I use level-1 to find item-3?
[18:42:16] <jqueryius> even though there are multiple layers of nesting
[18:53:32] <jqueryius> I have some code like this:
[18:53:33] <jqueryius> $(".fileinput").fileinput("clear");
[18:53:41] <jqueryius> 80% of the time, I just want it to run like that
[18:54:07] <jqueryius> the other 20% of the time, I only want it to run on the .fileinput classes that are somewhere INSIDE a div with id "end"
[18:54:37] <jqueryius> I figure I should put $(".fileinput").fileinput("clear"); into a function, but how can I make it such that I can achieve what I outlined above, without having a huge if/else statement?
[19:05:28] <IceTrAiN> jqueryius: why would it be a huge if/else? set it up into a function that takes an argument, and create an if based off of the argument passed in to determine which classes you want to target
[19:08:11] <jqueryius> ok
[19:08:15] <jqueryius> thanks IceTrAiN
[19:24:02] <jqueryius> Can anyone see the issue with this?
[19:24:03] <jqueryius> http://jsfiddle.net/sumw4/181/
[19:24:18] <jqueryius> In summary - trying to make checkbox readonly, but it's not being applied
[19:46:51] <jqueryius> anyone? :(    http://jsfiddle.net/sumw4/181/
[20:12:26] <blindMoe> I've been playing around with plugins like onScreen, fullPage, scrollMagic and some others to achieve an effect like this site: http://www.etq-amsterdam.com/    Anyone have any recomendations
[20:13:12] <blindMoe> Looking to do the page by page scroll but also have the ability for a single panel ( page ) be be scrollable as well.   scrollMagic seems to give the most options but feels fairly bloated with GSAP
[20:15:56] <DragonPunch> Cork: are you here?
[20:16:44] <lambdumb> what's the smartest way to listen for a variable change? i have a variable defined by a function that conditionally sets a global var to 1 or 0 and then later i want to run a function if that var is 1 or 0
[20:17:06] <lambdumb> currently i'm running a function like if (var == 1) do this with setInterval like every half second
[20:17:47] <lambdumb> and the caveat is i can't just call the function within that other function cause the function to be executed outside would be referencing a variable while it's being defined
[20:18:46] <blindMoe> lambdumb: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=javascript%20watch%20variable%20change
[20:19:01] <blindMoe> I am sure you already searched Google but there is probably an answer in that result list for ya
[20:20:14] <lambdumb> object.watch doesn't work on webkit does it?
[20:24:38] <blindMoe> lambdumb: I believe there are shims for it for IE and webkit
[20:24:50] <blindMoe> something like this: https://gist.github.com/eligrey/384583
[20:26:21] <lambdumb> hm, alright
[20:26:48] <blindMoe> I am definitely not saying I know that this is the best way but it is a step
[20:55:23] <datanity> when determining if a property is null, object, string... is there a better way to do it than this:
[20:55:25] <datanity>  if (res.msg !== null && typeof (res.msg) === 'object' && typeof (res.msg.preview) === 'object' && typeof (res.msg.preview.pre_draw) === 'string') {
[21:09:06] <user1596> hello
[21:09:34] <user1596> support speak french please ?
[21:14:08] <user1596> thx for your response bye
[21:21:01] <datanity> if you have two sibling methods insied of an object... and each of those sibling methods uses $(this) which referes to the same element.   Is there a way to cache $(this) so we do nto have to call it twice?
[21:21:05] <datanity> for example: http://pastie.org/10095335#1
[21:31:03] <Uhkis_> datanity: since your original $(this) is already in a variable, you can just var target = $this.parents()...
[21:31:29] <datanity> oh, well that makes it easy
[21:31:31] <datanity> thank you
[21:34:59] <datanity> what about... if you have a for loop like this... are you better off caching the selector?  http://pastie.org/10095345
[21:37:25] <Uhkis_> that's a weird selector
[21:37:59] <Uhkis> i don't see the point of caching that first part of the selector
[22:04:10] <u258> hi how to get id=A-* but not id=A-*-* eg get A-A, A-ABC, A-BBC but not A-A-X not A-A-Y etc
[22:06:42] <u258> $('id^=A-]'):not(?)
[22:29:52] <Cork> u258: use a class
[22:30:00] <Cork> don't match on partial ids
[22:30:29] <u258> yes. i was using class. and wonder if you guys have better way. thanks
[22:30:57] <Cork> u258: class is meant for the job
[22:30:59] <u258> [id=A] .. [id=A-A class=A] etc ...
[22:31:07] <Cork> uh.. no
[22:31:13] <u258> ok thanks we think same, just double check.
[22:31:18] <Cork> u258: [] is attribute selector
[22:31:27] <Cork> you want to avoid it as much as possiblt
[22:31:33] <Cork> *possible
[22:31:34] <u258> i mean my html <... id=A ...>
[22:31:53] <u258> my html markup.
[22:31:59] <Cork> <elm id="a-..." class="group-a">
[22:32:07] <Cork> $('.group-a')
[22:32:15] <Cork> don't do it by id
[22:32:31] <u258> yep . cool
[22:32:43] <SirLagz> is it still a bad idea to use global variables in JS ?
[22:33:14] <Cork> SirLagz: global variables are ok, but only if you really need them
[22:33:30] <Cork> SirLagz: most of the time you want to create a scope around the section you want it for
[22:33:39] <Cork> and make a shared scope instead
[22:33:49] <SirLagz> Cork: yeah that's what I figured. I've been trying to convince a team mate that global variables are bad and to minimise usage of them
[22:34:07] <Cork> (function() { var sharedVar; /* code */ })()
[22:34:43] <Cork> SirLagz: the reason globals are "bad" is cause you risk talking over each other
[22:35:09] <Cork> and can get really difficult to debug bugs
[22:35:20] <SirLagz> Cork: my team mate's attitude is 'it works now, if it breaks I'll come back and fix it later'
[22:35:29] <Cork> ...
[22:35:37] <SirLagz> except later could be when there's 10x the amount of code and it's 100x harder to debug =/
[22:36:03] <Cork> SirLagz: you mean when the site is so complex the solution is "rewrite it from scratch"
[22:36:18] <Uhkis> SirLagz: tell him "code like the guy maintaining your code is a serial killer who knows where you live"
[22:36:36] <SirLagz> Cork: we're working in Sharepoint so it's already pretty complex =/
[22:36:46] <Cork> ugg
[22:36:46] <SirLagz> Uhkis: bahahaha. I'll tell him that :D
[22:37:55] <Cork> SirLagz: also is he explicitly creating the variables or is he just not defining the variables?
[22:38:00] <SirLagz> I'm going to try and avoid maintaining this guys code. I've nicknamed the guy Captain Technical Debt
[22:38:12] <Cork> ya
[22:38:17] <SirLagz> Cork: he's explicitly creating the variables
[22:38:27] <Cork> sigh
[22:38:37] <Cork> well at least he is doing that i guess
[22:38:40] <SirLagz> haha
[22:39:38] <Uhkis> the code in the future: globalvariable1 globalvariable2; // it's getting hard to keep up with these
[22:40:30] <SirLagz> the issue he was trying to solve though...didn't even need the global variable. He just needed to do some $('#inputbox').val() in the callback of the ajax function =/
[22:41:01] <Cork> well ppl tend to give globals a worse time then they deserve
[22:41:23] <Cork> sure, you shouldn't use globals if you don't need them
[22:41:41] <Cork> but there are legit reasons to use them
[22:41:48] <SirLagz> Cork: ##php are absolutely against globals lol. I got flamed bad when I brought up the question last time because I didn't understand why they were bad
[22:41:54] <SirLagz> but then I found a good example and learnt my lesson.
[22:42:13] <Cork> SirLagz: well from my experience ##php are assholes
[22:42:27] <SirLagz> Cork: indeed. There are a few good people in there, but by and large, they can be quite toxic
[22:42:52] <Cork> ya, i remember asking a question there like 5 years back
[22:43:12] <Cork> got flamed for 15 minutes for using "" instead of '' (no variables involved)
[22:43:21] <Cork> but the question i asked was never answered :/
[22:43:25] <SirLagz> I idle in there for when I occasionally want to ask a question, but I normally don't ask unless I can see there's reasonable people in there
[22:43:29] <SirLagz> Cork: ouch
[22:43:48] <Cork> ya, that is when i stopped asking things in there
[22:44:00] <u258> after doing lots of minimized js and css, my php code looks like : for ($i=0;$i<10;$i++){...} ignore as much unnecessary space as possible, but still have basic line return and indented. am i m bad guy?
[22:44:41] <Cork> u258: spaces in the commands is up to taste, i don't care much
[22:44:52] <Cork> u258: i used to be "save space" way way back too :)
[22:45:05] <Cork> then i realized space as long as it is reasonable doesn't matter
[22:45:10] <Cork> just make sure it is easy to read
[22:45:27] <Cork> maintainability, maintainability, maintainability
[22:45:34] <Cork> anyway gtg
[22:45:46] <u258> yes still easy to read. but i have shocked a job interviewer, he is totally shocked at my codes
[22:45:57] <u258> :(
[22:48:08] <Uhkis> well that loop is pretty horrible to read
[22:51:39] <SirLagz> I prefer my code to be easy to read rather than save space
[22:52:08] <Uhkis> like Cork said: maintainability, maintainability, maintainability
[22:52:34] <SirLagz> indeed
[22:52:45] <SirLagz> that's what I'm trying to hammer into the head of my team mate...he ain't getting it.
[22:53:03] <u258> alright, i do not blame you. any i do not like that office and reject him as well
[22:53:12] <u258> *anyway
[22:53:19] <SirLagz> haha
[22:53:56] <Uhkis> SirLagz: i'm guessing that team mate is senior to you?
[22:54:03] <SirLagz> Uhkis: nope. Junior.
[22:54:24] <Uhkis> why does he still have that job..?
[22:54:39] <SirLagz> because we're a new team being formed
[22:55:34] <Uhkis> ballsy guy, i give him that :D
[22:55:36] <SirLagz> and he's been 'selected' to be in this new team
[23:00:50] <u258> am i correct that, we should include the jquery.js at end of page, instead originally in <head> ?
[23:01:20] <u258> *instead of
[23:02:44] <Uhkis> jquery in the head, plugins etc end of page
[23:04:32] <u258> ok thanks
[23:07:01] <u258> Do we put code like this $(function () {...}) as the bottom of the page as well, or does it have to be inside <head>
[23:07:19] <SirLagz> u258: that has to be inside <script> tags at least
[23:07:47] <u258> yeah.
[23:08:21] <u258> i m readying this page, is it still good, or too old :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/196702/where-to-place-javascript-in-a-html-file
[23:10:38] <Uhkis> "just before you need it and no sooner" is still a good answer
[23:11:45] <u258> ok thanks. -- so the experts are also not agree to each other :)
[23:12:12] <Uhkis> ?
[23:12:55] <Uhkis> $(function () {...}) is the same as $(document).ready(function() { so that also belongs to the bottom
[23:13:23] <Cork> actually there is no point in using it if it is as the bottom of body
[23:13:50] <Cork> $(function() {}) is the same as (function() {})() if it is as the end of the body
[23:14:01] <Cork> except some versions of ie has problems with it
[23:14:26] <Uhkis> heh, true
[23:15:27] <u258> i was told to have all js in an external .js file, and include in <head>
[23:15:36] <Cork> u258: that is fine
[23:16:03] <Cork> the only reason to move the <script> tag to the end of body is if you need rappid rendering of first visit
[23:16:15] <Cork> cause <script> in the head will block the rendering of the page
[23:16:34] <Cork> personally, if the site needs a login, i prefer to do just that (all in head)
[23:16:51] <Cork> there is only a point in moving it to the bottom for public web
[23:17:05] <Cork> where ms apparently matters
[23:17:55] <Uhkis> ms totally matters!
[23:18:38] <Uhkis> why else would zepto exist
[23:18:55] <Cork> i'm not convinced ±10ms matters no
[23:19:13] <Cork> and that is what ppl often hunts
[23:19:27] <Cork> if you go to 200-300+ the sure
[23:19:48] <u258> cork i go with you.
[23:19:50] <Cork> *then
[23:21:43] <Cork> i can't wait for when ie9 dies so we can start using <script defer> instead
[23:22:32] <Uhkis> Cork: just wait a year or ten :-)
[23:22:44] <Cork> or a few decades ya
[23:23:28] <Cork> it's sad how many ppl still use winxp (and by that ie<8)
[23:23:34] <Cork> opps ie<=8
[23:23:49] <Uhkis> and that even includes ie6
[23:23:53] <Uhkis> the horror!
[23:23:54] <Cork> ya
[23:24:19] <Cork> i have a relative that 2009 still used win2k and ie5.5 -_-
[23:24:33] <Cork> "there is no reason for me to update, websites still have to support ie5.5"
[23:24:37] <Cork> made me cry
[23:24:38] <Uhkis> now that's old school :D
[23:24:48] <Uhkis> ouch
[23:25:21] <Cork> especially as i had to go to work and spend an extra 2 weeks on a project to support 5.5...
[23:25:36] <Cork> 1 week for rest of the browsers, 2 weeks for ie < 7
[23:25:38] <Cork> *sigh*
[23:25:42] <Cork> the bad old days
[23:25:59] <Uhkis> 5.5 is so old that i don't even have a clue what it supports
[23:26:17] <Cork> Uhkis: things like click on anything except <a> tags
[23:26:44] <Cork> so it is the reason we still to this day have <a href="#">
[23:26:58] <Uhkis> no preventDefault() ?
[23:27:19] <Cork> <div> $('div').click(func) <-- no action
[23:27:42] <Cork> <a href="#"><div></div></a> $('a').click(func) <-- works
[23:28:12] <Cork> Uhkis: the click event could only originate from a and <input> elements
[23:28:24] <Cork> * <a> and <input> elements
[23:41:10] <Uhkis> sounds awesome
[23:42:20] <Uhkis> on another subject, gnome 3.16 is so much better than .14
[23:42:55] <Cork> ya, though there are some annoying features added too
[23:43:40] <Uhkis> haven't spotted any yet
[23:43:40] <Cork> 1. window theme can't be changed anymore
[23:43:57] <Cork> 2. context menu "open with" is sorted alphabetically instead of "last used"
[23:45:16] <Cork> and they still have the annoying feature added in 3.14
[23:45:35] <Cork> where if you for some reason need to restart gnome-shell gdm will kill your current gnome-session
[23:45:47] <Cork> "oh, you needed that?"
[23:46:00] <Uhkis> what :O
[23:46:07] <SirLagz> XFCEmasterrace
[23:46:25] <Cork> Uhkis: gnome-shell --replace doesn't work anymore if gnome-shell is started by gdm
[23:46:39] <Uhkis> Cork: just use run command and type in r
[23:46:41] <Cork> and if you use kill -<anything> gnome-shell
[23:46:58] <Cork> the gnome-session gets killed too and you get "opps something went wrong; logout"
[23:47:10] <Cork> Uhkis: and what if gnome-shell crashes or hangs?
[23:47:27] <SirLagz> that sounds like my multiseat machine. Log one user out, and it logs both seats out. rather annoying
[23:47:32] <Cork> the run command is implemented in gnome-shell...
[23:47:54] <Uhkis> Cork: well then it sucks :)
[23:47:57] <Cork> ya
[23:48:15] <Cork> so basically since 3.14 if you get a problem with gnome-shell: sudo reboot
[23:48:29] <Cork> that reminds me of windows soo much it makes me sad
[23:48:31] <SirLagz> hence why I don't use Gnome.
[23:48:33] <Uhkis> you're kidding right?
[23:48:39] <Cork> Uhkis: nope
[23:48:50] <Cork> Uhkis: all running programs will be killed anyway
[23:48:50] <Uhkis> how about systemctl restart gdm?
[23:49:03] <Cork> Uhkis: that is what kill gnome-shell does
[23:49:04] <Cork> basically
[23:49:21] <Cork> touch gnome-shell and the entire process tree is killed
[23:49:50] <Cork> and that is my big problem with later gnome-shell versions
[23:49:54] <Uhkis> SirLagz: XFCE is supermegahorrible and outdated :D
[23:49:58] <Cork> well the gnome team at a hole actually
[23:50:09] <SirLagz> Uhkis: at least I don't rely on gnome-shell :P
[23:50:12] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, mate is the current hipe
[23:50:42] <Cork> and this problem alone (along with all the extention breaking every freaking release) makes me seriously think about switching there
[23:50:50] <Uhkis> SirLagz: 100% stable here
[23:51:03] <Uhkis> mate was the gnome 2.x clone?
[23:51:09] <SirLagz> Uhkis: Oh I never had stability issues with gnome-shell. I had issues in that it's taking over anything and everything :P
[23:51:18] <Cork> with point at >was< yes
[23:51:29] <Cork> its been developed quite a big since then
[23:51:41] <Cork> and uses gtk3 if you want, today for example
[23:51:57] <Cork> (it supports both gtk2 and 3)
[23:52:48] <Cork> and they are porting cinnamons menu to it too
[23:53:00] <Cork> and... not sure what else there is in gnome3 that wasn't better in gnome2
[23:53:07] <datanity> $(oEle).each(function () {  for something like this, shuld we cache oEle before each?  or, does it only get searched for one time, even though it is in each.
[23:53:25] <Cork> datanity: its two separate functions
[23:53:40] <datanity> so, dont cache, thx Cork.
[23:53:50] <Cork> $('selector') traverses the dom and builds an array like object
[23:54:04] <Cork> .each is then called on this object and loops the list of elements
[23:54:15] <Uhkis> datanity: if that oEle is already a jquery object, don't $() it
[23:54:22] <Cork> that too
[23:54:33] <Cork> well $() doesn't really matter if it is actually
[23:54:51] <Cork> it just checks if the object is a jquery objects and returns it early if it is
[23:56:21] <Uhkis> SirLagz: taking over?
