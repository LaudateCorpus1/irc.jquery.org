[07:26:05] <Woet> Anamol: what is your jQuery question?
[07:30:33] <Anamol> its related to csss
[07:30:34] <Anamol> :3
[07:31:38] <Woet> Anamol: yea, so #css, not #jquery.
[07:31:55] <Woet> Anamol: and give them an actual test case, not tons of unrelated code.
[07:33:07] <Anamol> those are nothing by sidebars code and my query is related to sidebar
[07:33:08] <Anamol> ..
[07:46:00] <ryan_ford> is it a block element?
[07:50:38] <Anamol> ryan_ford can u come at the css channel
