[16:43:02] <Es0teric> if i had a div like <div class=".btn" data-filter="test1"></div> and i want to access the data.. would it be $('.btn').data('filter') == "test1" ?>
[16:43:04] <Es0teric> i mean ?
[16:43:35] <robertmaxrees> that div class is bad.
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> div class="btn"
[16:43:50] <robertmaxrees> then your js should work
[16:46:12] <Es0teric> whoops, robertmaxrees yeah i have my div class="btn"
[16:46:12] <Es0teric> sorry
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> 'k.
[16:46:46] <Es0teric> but it still doesnt work
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> define "doesn't work"
[16:46:59] <robertmaxrees> show some code.
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> gimme something to work with :)
[16:48:24] <Es0teric> https://jsfiddle.net/nv7p6rkt/
[16:48:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[16:49:02] <Es0teric> the idea is on click to call ajax for each different button
[16:49:04] <Es0teric> i know theres a better way
[16:49:04] <robertmaxrees> that seems to be working fine here.
[16:49:47] <Es0teric> its not working for me though
[16:49:52] <robertmaxrees> define "not working"
[16:50:21] <Es0teric> not displaying the console.log()
[16:50:24] <Es0teric> thats whats not working
[16:50:29] <robertmaxrees> it's working in that fiddle.
[16:50:33] <Es0teric> fuck
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:50:43] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - don't use switch statements.
[16:51:02] <Es0teric> yeah i figured that
[16:51:05] <Es0teric> but i wanted to test it out
[16:51:15] <Es0teric> however if i wanted to do an ajax on each button what would be the most suitable way?
[16:51:21] <robertmaxrees> really depends
[16:51:27] <robertmaxrees> what is the ajax doing?
[16:51:31] <robertmaxrees> what makes each button different?
[16:51:33] <Es0teric> querying a database
[16:51:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean from the frontend.
[16:51:44] <robertmaxrees> how do the calls themselves differ?
[16:51:45] <Es0teric> the type of data it will be querying
[16:51:51] <Es0teric> they wouldnt
[16:51:54] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:51:56] <Es0teric> wait
[16:55:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:02:07] <Jasein> in animate, does the callback return the html element or a jquery object?
[20:02:42] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to figure out
[20:04:10] <robertmaxrees> Jasein tho i gotta point out your question is kind of odd
[20:04:45] <Jasein> how so?
[20:05:01] <robertmaxrees> the callback returns whatever you return out of it :)
[20:05:12] <robertmaxrees> so i'm guessing that's not what you're asking.
[20:05:46] <Jasein> $("elem").animate(destparams, 2000, "easein",cb)
[20:06:13] <robertmaxrees> right, so the callback is a function you define.
[20:06:19] <Jasein> doesn't the animate function determine what it passes to the callback?
[20:06:33] <robertmaxrees> that's different from "return" :)
[20:07:36] <Jasein> Great. I will endeavor to be more accurate when I ask. That's an important difference. sorry.
[20:07:52] <robertmaxrees> so you're wondering what gets passed to the callback arg?
[20:08:41] <Jasein> yes. I think its' the element being animated, but I wasn't sure and wante dto avoid the rabbit hole of running test cases to figure it out.
[20:09:04] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[20:09:21] <robertmaxrees> you could literally just do function() { console.log(arguments) } as the callback to figure it out
[20:10:20] <Jasein> please understand that of course that is common sense to you. But I would have never thought of that. I would have spent hours doing type checking in jsfiddle or something. I would have never thought to log arguments.
[20:10:30] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[20:10:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:10:37] <robertmaxrees> hence why i suggested it
[20:11:04] <Jasein> I do appreciate it. I learn a lot from you all the time. Thank you.
[20:11:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3gamyr2L/5/
[20:11:25] <robertmaxrees> also: nothing gets passed to the callback
[20:11:53] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' is set to the dom node (like it is in most jquery functions)
[20:13:09] <robertmaxrees> fun fact - if you check the docs at http://api.jquery.com/animate/, you'll see that it says "Type: Function()" - https://i.imgur.com/V45yXwm.png
[20:13:41] <robertmaxrees> that means no args are passed to it.
[20:14:05] <Jasein> How, when you are first learning something, do you avoid getting constantly sidetracked every time you go to look something up?
[20:14:19] <Jasein> got it. Not sure why I thought that.
[20:14:23] <robertmaxrees> contrast that against another method like .on() and you'll see the difference: https://i.imgur.com/VMbGMsk.png
[20:14:39] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "avoid getting constantly sidetracked"?
[20:17:24] <Jasein> For example, I am working on the same project (for fun) for well over a year. Everyttime I make a series of steps in the right direction, there's some new way to do things. Since I'm at liberty to explore, I get sidetracked and never get my project completed.
[20:18:15] <robertmaxrees> i would argue that's not getting sidetracked.  that's just learning.  are you relatively new to writing code?
[20:19:13] <Jasein> Never written any code in any official capacity.
[20:19:37] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[20:20:01] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things: 1) "official" is a myth, and 2) just focus on getting the thing done.
[20:20:02] <robertmaxrees> ship v1
