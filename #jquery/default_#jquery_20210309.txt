[15:18:00] <robskipper> Hello. Is there anyone here from jquery that could provide a traceroute from jquery source hosts 69.16.175.42 and source host 69.16.175.10 to destination 207.11.1.161, which is an external address for one of my companies external addresses? We are troubleshooting not getting any return traffic from code.jquery.com
[15:18:20] <robertmaxrees> you mean you're unable to load code.jquery.com?
[15:19:51] <robskipper> Yes when our reps log into our salesforce page, that page forces the user to open a pop up to code.jquery.com. We can see the request go out of network, but we don't get any reply from code.jquery.com and get a 502 web error
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> what's the specific url?
[15:20:51] <robskipper> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js
[15:22:55] <robertmaxrees> might be a cdn issue - create an issue at https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues
[15:22:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:35:21] <robskipper> Ok I've created an issue at the link you posted
[15:45:41] <robskipper> Does anyone know what the normal turn around time is once you create an issue at https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues  ?
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> it can depend on when folks have time.
[15:49:09] <robertmaxrees> you might need to download and reference a local copy for your servers.
