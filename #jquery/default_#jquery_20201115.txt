[16:26:33] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery validation in my post-form and if i put the class "cancel" on the cancel-button this works just fine. but it also suppresses the post-submission. thus the server side doesn't know the cancel button was pressed. how can i accomplish this?
[16:27:10] <Azrael_-> btw: hi :)
[17:01:33] <Robdgreat> isn't that what cancel is supposed to do?
