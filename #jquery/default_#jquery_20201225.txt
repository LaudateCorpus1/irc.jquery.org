[09:12:29] <tester12> Hi
[09:13:00] <tester12> How can I Start with div or button hidden then toggle using Animate fadeIn
[09:13:11] <tester12> example
[09:18:48] <tester12> Excuse me Im disconnected
[09:21:14] <tester12> I use toggle() and first in document.ready() hide the button by .hide() but toggle doesnt work, but if element displayed since start, the .toggle() works

[15:59:31] <DB_Rando> Hey guys
[15:59:43] <DB_Rando> I'm doing a countdown timer based on this guide https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_countdown
[15:59:57] <DB_Rando> Problem is I need every individual digit to be wrapped in its' own <span>
[16:00:44] <DB_Rando> So 01:23:14:55 would need to be output as <div class="days"><span>0</span><span>1</span></div> : <div class="hours"><span>2</span>...
[16:01:01] <DB_Rando> I'm using split to achieve this but it's being split every second to get this output
[16:01:06] <DB_Rando> Which I imagine isn't really ideal
[16:01:25] <DB_Rando> Can someone suggest an alternative that's a bit more lightweight?
[17:10:45] <robertmaxrees> DB_Rando that's not really a jquery question :)  try in ##javascript.
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> (also fwiw you don't need to use .split() here - just make it part of the markup from the get-go)
