[05:52:11] <Paradisee> hey o/
[05:52:38] <Paradisee> how can i convert this '11/12/13' into '11-12-13' ?
[05:53:20] <Cork> .replace(/\//, '-')
[05:53:26] <Cork> if you just want a string convertion
[05:53:40] <Cork> or use moment.js if you want a lib that actually understands dates
[05:54:54] <Paradisee> '11/12/13'.replace(/\//, '-')
[05:54:55] <Paradisee> "11-12/13"
[06:04:26] <Paradisee> i've changed format, fixed that way
[06:12:15] <Cork> ah right '11/12/13'.replace(/\//g, '-')
[06:12:22] * Cork gtg
[07:27:01] <Stoot> Cool I have a native HTML range slider now I need to get the value inside the dot which is now next to it :)
[08:36:27] <Stoot> Are people still using jquery-ui ?
[08:38:46] <undefined_bob> Stoot: someone posted this link regarding jquery-ui yesterday: https://blog.jqueryui.com/2017/12/the-future-of-jquery-ui-and-jquery-mobile/
[08:39:30] <Stoot> undefined_bob yeah pretty old posts(s)
[08:39:35] <Stoot> *post(s)
[08:40:53] <undefined_bob> Stoot: indeed but its the most recent one
[08:41:23] <undefined_bob> which speaks for itself
[08:41:52] <Stoot> nah not really, it are mostly opinions :D
[08:42:13] <undefined_bob> but I just wanted to provide some additional info for you :) as I dont know how many people still using jquery-ui
[08:42:16] <Cork> i would say jquery-ui is close to dead now days
[08:42:32] <Stoot> undefined_bob true!
[08:42:36] <Stoot> Cork seems so
[08:42:46] <Cork> for example such a simple thing as it hasn't had a commit in over two years
[08:42:49] <Stoot> But jQuery itself will live is you ask me
[08:42:59] <Stoot> *if
[08:43:14] <Cork> jquery is still alive, but it has deminitioning purpose
[08:43:25] <Cork> as the compatibility layer for browsers isn't really needed anymore
[08:43:45] <Stoot> no but frameworks are Vue are not really better then Jquery if you ask me
[08:43:45] <Cork> and as fetch gets common place there isn't really much need for it
[08:43:55] <Cork> heck no
[08:44:26] <Stoot> I like the Jquery syntax much more, less pragmatic and much more clear and logic
[08:44:29] <Cork> jquery is a nicly written framework, but the point is es2017+ kinda makes frameworks not needed
[08:45:15] <Stoot> nah I just like the syntax and even better, the libs that support it, like datepicker
[08:45:32] <Cork> well datepicker is jqeury-ui not jquery
[08:45:41] <Stoot> no the datepicker lib
[08:45:44] <Stoot> not the UI one
[08:45:58] <Cork> don't think i've ever used that one
[08:46:15] <Cork> if i don't use the jquery-ui datepicker, i use the built in one in the browser
[08:46:45] <Stoot> datepicker.js is great, has great options, just perfect
[08:47:01] <Stoot> such layers between changing browsers are good
[08:53:23] <thykka> flatpickr is pretty neat
[08:53:59] <Stoot> yeah didn't use thgat one for reasons I think
[09:45:43] <Jaami> hi, can someone help me with jquery slide menue problem? i got sample code and it works fine when run from its own folder but when i make my own folder and write  proper link and script tags the menu does not look as original. i am sure my html has correct path to the js and css files. I cannot find reason why index.html in orignal folder runs good but same index file from new folder does not show correct output.
[09:47:21] <thykka> sounds like wrong paths
[09:47:36] <Jaami> yes, but i have checked many times
[09:47:52] <thykka> I'll just have to take your word for that..
[09:48:01] <Jaami> i use jetbrain IDE which checks path
[09:48:24] <Jaami> there is something else with it
[09:48:33] <thykka> err.. did you manually check and verify? not just with your IDE?
[09:49:00] <Jaami> in inspect tere is no error
[09:49:02] <thykka> your IDE's definition of paths can be different, from what the browser sees
[09:49:13] <thykka> do all the files get loaded in the browser?
[09:49:23] <Jaami> yes, all files get loaded
[09:51:32] <Jaami> there is only one change in new index, after the menu code i have loaded jqxgrid which is ints own div
[09:52:26] <Jaami> let me get rid of the jqxgrid and test again
[09:53:44] <Jaami> i checked, same problem. console is clean without any error message
[09:54:27] <Jaami> if i run the same code from original extracted zip file then every thing is perfect
[09:55:14] <Jaami> does it mean that, the original code cannot be copied into new folder?
[09:56:10] <Jaami> if i run my code without the IDE even then new folder does not show correct output.
[10:01:20] <Jaami> would you see both index files if i paste them?
[10:02:38] <Jaami> is it like har coding problem?
[10:02:45] <Jaami> hard**
[10:14:49] <Jaami> can someone check this code if it works when used in new folder instead of extracted one. i mean just a new parent  folder if create and it runs ok? http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/30/google-nexus-website-menu/
[10:20:12] <Jaami> hello !!!
[12:57:48] <Stoot> what is the best way to apply something on a inputfield when your best bet is the classname to select it ?
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:58:22] <robertmaxrees> you... select it?
[12:59:09] <Stoot> yes but I don't know the formname so I can't do $('whatever', form);
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify the issue?
[12:59:36] <Stoot> robertmaxrees slider is perfectly fine fixed btw, thanks!
[12:59:52] <robertmaxrees> it seems like you're leaving out a bunch of context.
[13:00:35] <Stoot> I build my HTML form dynamically, lightboxes, and in this case I want to replace textareas with a class 'ckeditor' with the ckeditor
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> then just $('.ckeditor')
[13:01:52] <Stoot> ok, good let me try that, thanks!
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> that'll select everything with that class in the entire page.
[13:02:09] <Stoot> I want ot stay flexible and don't be stuck later on :)
[13:02:32] <Stoot> yes that is fine
[13:02:43] <robertmaxrees> were you not familiar with that syntax?
[13:03:24] <Stoot> yes but I was switching code again, so PHP to JS, I always need 2-3 days to pick it all up again
[13:03:33] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  ok.
[13:04:54] <Stoot> yeah sorry :)
[13:05:29] <Stoot> I'm more a DevOps that can think deeper into network then most devs so I cannot know all just at once sometimes :D
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> just odd that you'd remember the rarely used $('.child', '.parent') but not $('.child') :)
[13:07:25] <Stoot> yeah, stupid me I know but it's more that that might need some refactor later on... so I'm too focussed then on what is used
[13:07:36] <robertmaxrees> not saying "stupid", just interesting.  that's all :)
[13:08:32] <Stoot> cool! I fixed what I needed directly and not even using the selector :D
[13:08:37] <Stoot> in a decent way I needed
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:09:21] <Stoot> robertmaxrees I'm interesting, good you notice, I can always help with something and together we come to something :)  I won't judge you ;)
[13:09:24] <Stoot> no worries!
[13:14:17] <Stoot> robertmaxrees you always have some great influence on me and because of that I fix things the way it needed to be, thanks a lot every time!
[13:18:17] <Stoot> if you doubt why, you don't just, stay relaxed and just answers about what someone asks with out trying to be a fancy boy. (I'm sure you are a fancy woman/male magnet anyhow... :P)
[13:18:28] <Stoot> *you don't judge
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused but thanks I guess?
[13:19:05] <Stoot> it's all love, so you're welcome :)
[13:19:27] <Stoot> loves confuses people... no worries!
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> k
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> back to the topic.
[13:19:45] <Stoot> brb dogwalk
[14:29:01] <Flyste> I have a div that has a scroll bar and at the bottom I have an anchor in a <a>, how can I scroll that particular div down to the anchor?
[14:34:31] <royalty> Flyste, <a href="#dividgoeshere"> anchor tag dawg </a>
[14:35:03] <royalty> or if you want to use jquery
[14:35:12] <royalty> use jQuery.offset or something
[14:36:18] <royalty> oh you mean within another div, same concept I suppose, except you'd find the offset from the parent element
[14:36:34] <royalty> and then I think you could do parentElement.scroll or something
[14:39:12] <Flyste> I want to scroll to the anchor automatically after an ajax call is completed
[14:50:05] <Gh0st_Preacher> use the ID.
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> <div id="foo">
[14:50:50] <robertmaxrees> then window.location.hash = 'foo';  iirc.
[15:08:15] <snatcher> is there a way to replace innerHTML with array of elements or .empty() .append(...) is only way?
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> is it an array of elements or a jquery object?
[15:09:49] <snatcher> array of jquery objects
[15:09:53] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:10:03] <robertmaxrees> that's... non-optimal.
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd make it either a jquery object of elements, or an array of elements.
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> but an array of jquery objects makes your ask much, much harder.
[15:10:52] <robertmaxrees> if you just had an array of strings, you could do $('#foo').html(theArray.join(''));
[15:13:07] <snatcher> what do you mean by "non-optimal"? my case is:
[15:13:11] <snatcher> const es = []; for (const s of ss) { const $d = $('<div></div>'); for (const f of s.split(',')) { $d.append($('<div></div>').text(s));} es.push($d);}; return es
[15:13:22] <robertmaxrees> i mean it's a bad idea to have an array of jquery objects.
[15:14:36] <snatcher> what's the better (without array of jquery objects) way in my case? ^^^
[15:15:10] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle or something so I can better understand what you're doing?
[15:16:48] * Stoot fiddles robertmaxrees until he giggles
[15:17:36] <robertmaxrees> uuuuhhhh
[15:18:05] <Stoot> that is also a reaction but a different type of... :D
[15:18:28] <robertmaxrees> that's more of a "wtf" reaction.
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> kinda making me uncomfortable there.
[15:21:47] <snatcher> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/okar8uLy/
[15:21:50] <Stoot> oh my, I don't know where there is, maybe I don't want to know :P
[15:22:11] <Stoot> relax :)
[15:22:51] <robertmaxrees> oh shoot i'm so sorry hahahaha
[15:22:56] <Stoot> haha
[15:23:06] <robertmaxrees> snatcher i'm so sorry - totally my bad.
[15:23:27] <snatcher> no problems
[15:23:44] <Stoot> snatcher he wan't able to help :)  /me looks at your fiddle
[15:23:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm helping right now.
[15:24:07] <Stoot> more help is always good ?
[15:24:42] <Stoot> snatcher can't you just overwrite using a foreach ?
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a good idea either.
[15:25:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd do nested maps to get your array of elements.
[15:25:03] <Stoot> that is why I ask, cache issues ?
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> then do the .join('') i mentioned earlier.
[15:27:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2x69kya3/5/
[15:28:24] <robertmaxrees> so you'd end up with something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2x69kya3/7/ snatcher
[15:28:36] <Stoot> mhh
[15:29:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise your initial goal isn't really do-able without some janky wrangling.
[15:29:37] <snatcher> doesn't look safe
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[15:30:02] <robertmaxrees> how is that any more or less safe than what you have right now?
[15:30:07] <snatcher> >'<div>' + currentString + '</div>'
[15:30:14] <robertmaxrees> that's just simple string concatenation.
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> and effectively what you're doing now.
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> plus if you're feeding this user-generated input, your server should be sanitizing it on input and output anyway.
[15:36:23] <snatcher> server sanitized any html special character in returned json to be sure it won't break html, are you sure?
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:36:48] <robertmaxrees> am I sure of what?
[15:36:55] <snatcher> in my case strings from json response
[15:37:14] <snatcher> so >'<div>' + currentString + '</div>' is bad idea
[15:37:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:37:22] <robertmaxrees> not if your sanitizing.
[15:37:31] <robertmaxrees> no more or less dangerous than your append, to boiot.
[15:38:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5d6mnxth/
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> so long as you're sanitizing your user-generated content, you're fine.
[15:39:45] <snatcher> server-side generated content in my case
[15:39:53] <robertmaxrees> then you're a-ok.
[15:40:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're in control of the data coming in and out, it's fine.
[15:43:18] <snatcher> you don't understand, server returns json generated from some app, where any html special character is _valid_, output will be broken if currentString contains any html special character/sequence while .text() sanitizes it
[15:43:47] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[15:43:56] <snatcher> what?
[15:44:39] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: you saying "you don't understand" when your example didn't give me any indication that the text content could have markup in it, and where is this JSON coming from?
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> and 3, my core idea is still perfectly valid.  you can update it for your needs.
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> i didn't say it was *the* solution, simply an idea of how to better tackle this issue.
[15:46:06] <snatcher> is there a way to just sanitize string with jquery?
[15:46:18] <robertmaxrees> why can't you trust the source of the data?
[15:46:23] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need jquery to do that.
[15:47:31] <snatcher> because >any html special character is _valid_ and appears in that data
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> so you want to present the HTML as just text?
[15:48:42] <snatcher> nope, want to present text with html special characters as text, not an html in my case
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> or do you want to grab any text conent of the node?
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> *content
[15:49:22] <robertmaxrees> can you provide an example of the actual content you're getting?
[15:49:31] <robertmaxrees> or something more indicative, so I can better understand what you're trying to do?
[15:49:54] <snatcher> nevermind
[15:50:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:42:56] <Stoot> robertmaxrees do you use ckeditor here and there ?
[16:43:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  what's your question?>
[16:44:36] <Stoot> I'm figuring out how you can apply a config when I load it in my HTML parser like this: outputField = $('<textarea>').attr('name', element.name).attr('class', 'ckeditor').ckeditor();
[16:44:54] <Stoot> s/you/I
[16:45:54] <Stoot> I don't have the instance there (yet), I could overwrite it after it's loaded but that is odd
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> most plugins let you pass a config object to the initializer - .ckEditor({foo: 'bar'});
[16:46:46] <foo> robertmaxrees: I am more than just some person at the bar!
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:47:09] <Stoot> yes that is what I'm not able to find, it seems you apply it to the instance/object and now like I hope it would and you think it should work as well
[16:47:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:47:31] <Stoot> foo you are the womanizer there ?
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> back on track duder.
[16:48:00] <Stoot> robertmaxrees yes you have an instance like CKEDITOR.replace
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to say it just doesn't work the way you expect?
[16:48:10] <robertmaxrees> you lost me.
[16:48:11] <robertmaxrees> show me a fiddle.
[16:48:19] <Stoot> no, I don't know the best way yet
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:48:31] * foo smacks Stoot 
[16:48:40] <robertmaxrees> i have no frame of reference of what you're talking about.
[16:48:43] <robertmaxrees> so it's hard to help.
[16:48:54] <Stoot> foo I only accept bitchslaps, sorry
[16:48:59] <Stoot> Robdgreat I will make a fiddle, sec
[16:49:05] <Stoot> robertmaxrees ^
[16:49:21] <foo> Stoot: rofl.
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> hey careful with the language duder.
[16:49:44] <Stoot> nothing bad ment by it, it's more like sarcasm :)
[16:50:14] <Stoot> robertmaxrees can you work with some "fiddle" that shows how it's done on the instance ?
[16:50:23] <Stoot> doesn't need to work but just for the idea
[16:50:33] <robertmaxrees> i don't even understand what you're trying to do.
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm asking for a fiddole.
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[16:50:58] <Stoot> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/L4kawj0n/ here this is how it works on the instance
[16:51:25] <Stoot> this is if you replace, you load the same way I guess but didn't found that yet for this way
[16:51:38] <robertmaxrees> you're asking how to run methods against an instance.
[16:51:46] <robertmaxrees> yes?
[16:52:14] <Stoot> yes but I think I don't have an instance in my line yet, or does JS do it when it's loaded ?
[16:52:24] <Stoot> I mean, can I count on that
[16:52:30] <robertmaxrees> how would you normally create the instance?
[16:52:47] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to init, store the return of the init, and then call methods as necessary.
[16:53:18] <Stoot> robertmaxrees like I showed you, JS lib does the rest
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> so the CKEDITOR object gets mysteriously autocreated?
[16:53:47] <Stoot> yes, it just looks for the class
[16:53:55] <Stoot> *classname
[16:54:16] <robertmaxrees> i have big doubts about there - somewhere in your code there is likely a var CKEDITOR =
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> or const or let.
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> either way, that's getting set somewhere.
[16:55:07] <Stoot> nope
[16:55:27] <robertmaxrees> i don't believe you.
[16:55:37] <Stoot> it really is
[16:56:05] <Stoot> outputField = $('<textarea>').attr('name', element.name).attr('class', 'ckeditor').ckeditor(); that is how I load all my formfields
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> outputField.methodNameHere();
[17:04:22] <Stoot> foo what did you do to robertmaxrees ?
