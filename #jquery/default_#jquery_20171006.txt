[01:17:50] <linurandy> i'm making study case en jsfiddle for a doudbt that i've and don't work. i think the problem is ajax request. this is the link: https://jsfiddle.net/linurandy/fbjajc86/24/
[02:20:10] <Cork> linurandy: it does, but you don't handle the response
[02:29:34] <Cork> linurandy: https://jsfiddle.net/fbjajc86/27/
[02:40:00] <linurandy> who is the best chart for jquery with dinamic data
[02:40:54] <Woet> i am
[02:45:16] <linurandy> is the chartjs the best?
[02:53:22] <Uhkis> highcharts is pretty good
[02:56:46] <Cork> what is best depends quite a lot on what you need it for
[02:57:28] <Cork> highcarts is good, not very flexible though, d3 is very flexible but doesn't give you key ready charts
[02:57:53] <Cork> also if you want svg based or canvas is also a factor
[03:03:04] <linurandy>  i wanna make circle chart with data inside like circliful
[03:03:17] <linurandy> chartjs do it?
[03:29:10] <linurandy> Cork i see your correction and thanks but the className in the datatable appear in all the colum including the thead wy?
[03:32:05] <Cork> linurandy: what classname?
[03:35:37] <Neo1> #/join #woocommerce
[03:43:02] <linurandy> from datatable jquery plugin
[06:55:47] <Chulbul> jquery is returning: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #toggleReportColumns input[value='<span class="multiselect-native-select"><select class="multi-select-container1" but jsonlint says json is fine. Any suggestion?
[06:56:25] <Cork> Chulbul: arey you building html and giving it to $()?
[06:57:49] <Chulbul> Cork: yes
[06:58:05] <Cork> the use $($.parseHTML())
[06:58:20] <Cork> you have spaces in the beginning and the string sniffer things it is a selector
[06:59:46] <Chulbul> Cork: Ok
[07:00:04] <Cork> s/spaces/leading spaces/
[07:00:56] <Cork> alternatively construct dom elements and use that instead (it is safer too cause then you avoid getting exposed to xss)
[07:06:03] <Chulbul> Cork: Ok
[07:07:12] <Chulbul> Cork: thanks, issue resolved
[07:11:08] <Chulbul> Cork: Sorry, it didn't work, same issue. $("#reportTable").html($.parseHTML(output)); I added it like this.
[07:11:40] <Cork> can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[07:13:07] <Chulbul> Cork: Let me do it
[07:18:40] <Chulbul> Cork: Unable to create jsfiddle, something is wrong with the HTML, can I send html via pastebin?
[07:18:55] <Woet> Chulbul: why would that prevent you from creating a jsfiddle?
[07:19:17] <Cork> also that is prob the hint to where the problem is
[07:19:39] <Chulbul> Run button is not executing, and the html code is displayed with some errors, few in grey color, few were in green.
[07:19:58] <Chulbul> Something is wrong with HTML.
[07:19:59] <Cork> so just save it and paste the link
[07:20:14] <Chulbul> Cork: Oh yeah, right
[07:20:40] <Chulbul> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/k37xhgah/ Woet
[07:21:02] <Woet> never a good sign when jsfiddle takes 10 seconds to load
[07:21:07] <Woet> what on earth
[07:21:11] <Cork> you have ' in the string
[07:21:17] <Cork> and it isn't escaped
[07:21:33] <Cork> its the syntax highlighting
[07:22:41] <Chulbul> Cork: Ok, so can it be done in jquery?
[07:23:11] <Cork> Chulbul: https://jsfiddle.net/k37xhgah/1/
[07:24:47] <Chulbul> Cork: I'm retrieving this html via ajax and php, so I can't push it inside script template tag.
[07:24:56] <Cork> you don't need to
[07:25:08] <Cork> this just emulates that better then putting it in variable = '';
[07:25:53] <Cork> Chulbul: this is to emulate the .done handler https://jsfiddle.net/k37xhgah/2/
[07:27:05] <Chulbul> Cork: let me see
[07:33:08] <Chulbul> Cork: How can I use <script type="text/script"> with my impleentation or how can I escape ' using jquery itseld
[07:33:42] <Cork> Chulbul: the <script> is just a way to hold text content without having to escape the interpreter for the string character
[07:33:58] <Cork> the data you get over ajax should literally be identical
[07:35:18] <Chulbul> Cork: Oh, got it. Now the main problem, Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #toggleReportColumns input ....
[07:35:35] <Cork> so again, can you reproduce it in the jsfiddle?
[07:36:39] <Chulbul> just checking Cork
[07:36:44] <Chulbul> fiddle is loading.
[07:41:04] <Chulbul> Cork: No issue at jsfiddle.
[07:41:15] <Chulbul> But facing it on my site.
[07:41:36] <Cork> Chulbul: so you need to figure out what you do differently
[07:41:53] <Chulbul> Cork: Hmm ok
[08:08:19] <Neo1> who know here room just for speak?
[08:15:23] <Chulbul> Cork: I found where is an issue: column.data().unique().sort().each(function (d, j) { select.append('<option value="' + d + '">' + d + '</option>'), }); this d variable is not correct somehow. Work in progress.
[08:16:10] <Cork> ugg that's horrible...
[08:16:20] <Cork> select.append($('<option value="' + d + '">' + d + '</option>')
[08:16:24] <Cork> opps
[08:17:01] <Cork> select.append($('<option>', { text: d })); <-- use that
[08:17:12] <Cork> you don't need to set value if it is identical to what is in the option
[08:18:26] <Chulbul> Cork: And it worked: select.append('<option value="' + $.parseHTML(d) + '">' + $.parseHTML(d) + '</option>')
[08:18:38] <Cork> Chulbul: use my example instead
[08:18:44] <Chulbul> Cork: Oh :o, let me try
[08:18:45] <Cork> the code you have there is really bad
[08:23:03] <Chulbul> Cork: hmm, it worked fine.
[08:23:32] <Chulbul> and it didn't need parseHtml also
[08:23:42] <Cork> ya, cause it doesn't parse html
[08:24:07] <Cork> that's the xss part i talked about a while ago
[09:29:06] <Chulbul> Cork: Ok
[10:18:53] <Kev-> I have a $.ajax() call that's stuck at pending for 1-2 minutes, before being fired and sent to the server. Anyone have an idea what might be the issue? I can see it pending in the network viewer in chrome, but it takes 1-2 minutes before it's actually sent (and logged) to apache. The backend responds within 0.0004 seconds
[10:24:17] <Cork> Kev-: do you fire multiple calls at aproximatly the same time?
[10:45:34] <Kev-> Not that I know of :)
[10:50:47] <Cork> Kev-: the reason i asked is that you could hit the max connections per domain
[10:51:20] <Cork> Kev-: except for that the only other reason i can think of is either the server is slow or you have a setTimeout in the code
[11:29:52] <Kev-> Yeah I probably have some error somewhere... It's just not popping up for me anywhere.
[12:34:31] <fuzefs> off the top of your head, what does $(10) return?
[12:39:41] <fuzefs> found out it just retunrs {0: 10}
[12:42:41] <Uhkis> weird
[12:43:38] <shoky> it returns a jquery object wrapping one item, being the value 10 ;p
[12:48:49] <Neo1> guys, I think about create my own chat, is it possible or need special hosting?
[12:49:09] <Neo1> I want put chat here http://kselax.ru
[12:49:34] <Neo1> possibly do this on jQuery?
[12:50:19] <Neo1> just my friend long time can't create hacker chat, I'm tired wait him...
[12:50:54] <Neo1> faster create your own or I don't know, Who know some good chats on jQuery?
[12:52:28] <Neo1> this just for think, maybe better take prepared app and use
[12:54:36] <Uhkis> jquery isn't enough
[12:59:51] <ExtraSteve> I would say: don't reinvent the wheel
[13:00:19] <ExtraSteve> IRC already exists and there are web-based clients (kiwi, etc)
[13:04:12] <Neo1> Uhkis: why?
[13:04:20] <Neo1> Uhkis: see I have idea
[13:05:17] <Neo1> Uhkis: we can run timer on each user , timer will do each second ajax request to server and receives data and put in common chat? What do you think about this?
[13:05:46] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: irc difficult use for usual users
[13:06:10] <Uhkis> Neo1: that's the gist of it, but as you described, you'll need a backend
[13:07:45] <Neo1> and on backend will one table in database
[13:08:18] <Neo1> Uhkis: in backend easy one table and one php file which will accept request form scripts
[13:09:01] <Neo1> Uhkis: there must be two types of requests, send message to database and get all massage
[13:09:22] <ExtraSteve> Neo1: it's a tech website right? How is IRC too hard for tech people?
[13:09:22] <Neo1> Uhkis: but I think it will overload server if doing every 1 or 2 seconds request
[13:09:47] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: I want create chat not teach, about all, just for speak
[13:10:10] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: easy one room, in IRC frequently give ban
[13:10:29] <ExtraSteve> i see
[13:10:38] <Uhkis> Neo1: do some websocketing
[13:11:14] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: I recent go to #politics and got instantly ban only ask one question and in #psycholodgy also speak and got ban, there Admin said 'I wasn't suggesting he is learning here English'
[13:11:41] <ExtraSteve> Neo1: create your own channel then
[13:11:49] <ExtraSteve> Then you get to decide who gets banned :)
[13:11:54] <ExtraSteve> You will own it
[13:12:05] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: I thought about, but I want, #English is free name
[13:12:22] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: or #English_grammar
[13:12:44] <ExtraSteve> You could even make your own irc server - then you can have whatever channel names you want
[13:12:49] <ExtraSteve> Just an idea ;)
[13:13:27] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: irc difficult archive, I never use it before, didn't know what it is and need know command how do here search, it's not for simple users
[13:14:00] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: no, better make easy chat, See what i think about make speed fast
[13:14:26] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: do you think all chats use JS timer?
[13:14:57] <ExtraSteve> I am not sure what other chats do
[13:15:21] <Neo1> what do need use for update common chat? I know only timer I used it when I was creating casino roulette
[13:15:39] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: see like this speaking7.com
[13:16:04] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: it's wholly used javascript and there not bad speed seems
[13:16:36] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: before there was lags, sometimes doubled messages, now seems not
[13:16:46] <ExtraSteve> You will probably need some websockets to achieve it
[13:17:01] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: there can 60 people in the same time
[13:17:16] <Neo1> what need/
[13:17:49] <ExtraSteve> If you just use a timer + ajax to check for new messages, it could be a big load for your server
[13:17:52] <ExtraSteve> If lots of people are on
[13:18:08] <Neo1> yes maybe
[13:18:11] <ExtraSteve> For 2 or 3 people, no problem
[13:18:16] <ExtraSteve> But for 60 people...
[13:18:16] <Neo1> good DDOS
[13:18:28] <ExtraSteve> If it refreshes once every second
[13:18:35] <ExtraSteve> That's 60 http requests per second
[13:18:44] <ExtraSteve> The server may not be happy :)
[13:18:46] <Neo1> 60 equal 60 queries per second
[13:19:34] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: but see if we will give static data without making request to database much?
[13:20:23] <ExtraSteve> I wouldn't use a database at all. Too much overhead
[13:20:39] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: when user send message we will run handler and put new massage to file and this file will got by Ajax function
[13:20:59] <ExtraSteve> And using flat files will require lots of disk IO
[13:21:05] <ExtraSteve> I would use something in-memory
[13:21:23] <ExtraSteve> memcached, redis, or something like that
[13:21:29] <MassDebates> object cache?
[13:21:31] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: oh yes
[13:21:34] <MassDebates> For serving?
[13:21:37] <MassDebates> #madlands
[13:21:39] <MassDebates> #madlads*
[13:22:00] <Neo1> and this can be rewrite in the same time if get two message, interesting php support blocking file on write
[13:22:07] <ExtraSteve> Or if you DO use database, use something very light - like a MEMORY table
[13:22:33] <Neo1> yes
[13:23:10] <MassDebates> I find that the best way to get ultra-optimized data is by just having json
[13:23:24] <MassDebates> for example, templating and using json as config cues for thatching together.
[13:23:40] <ExtraSteve> Honestly though - this is already more complicated than setting up unrealircd + kiwiirc
[13:23:43] <MassDebates> Then again, this sort of thing is totally open to the client, so..
[13:23:51] <Neo1> I am just thinking about use prepared scripts and don't spend time on own scripts
[13:24:01] <ExtraSteve> kiwi + unreal = 1 hour of work, max
[13:24:10] <ExtraSteve> And you don't need to be an IRC expert to use kiwi
[13:24:24] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: yes
[13:24:50] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: irc no, ask ordinary people about this, they even didn't hear it
[13:25:10] <ExtraSteve> They don't need an IRC client or anything
[13:25:18] <ExtraSteve> Then can use a web one like kiwi
[13:25:23] <ExtraSteve> They don't need to know commands
[13:25:26] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: I seem IRC is used by freaks )
[13:25:38] <ExtraSteve> They don't even need to know that the chat is IRC based :p
[13:25:53] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: or like mibbit
[13:26:06] <ExtraSteve> yeah, mibbit and kiwi are excellent
[13:26:18] <ExtraSteve> And you can embed those into your website
[13:26:32] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: agree this is difficult, better go to usual chat
[13:26:58] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: really? Need look at variants
[13:27:32] <ExtraSteve> <iframe src="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.kiwiirc.com/#your_channel" style="border:0; width:100%; height:450px;"></iframe>
[13:27:36] <ExtraSteve> That's all you need
[13:27:54] <Uhkis> but it's so hard! :D
[13:27:56] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: listen if chat has 2000 users it's each second is going 2000 request?
[13:28:20] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: no, maybe they use not timer, something else for update?
[13:28:21] <ExtraSteve> If you use IRC, it will put the load on the IRC server - not your website
[13:28:50] <Neo1> I understand
[13:28:58] <Neo1> I mean about js chat
[13:29:20] <ExtraSteve> if you make your own and use timer + ajax, yes
[13:29:21] <Neo1> there can server send in browser request about update, seems not
[13:29:26] <ExtraSteve> Then the server takes the load
[13:29:43] <Neo1> and without timer possibly to do?
[13:30:00] <ExtraSteve> But the server cannot PUSH the update. The browser must ASK for the update
[13:30:08] <ExtraSteve> Unless you use websockets
[13:30:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> just trying to build a chat?
[13:30:28] <Neo1> idea need leave server without load, see if we will deny clients instantly this is not much load on server
[13:30:34] <ExtraSteve> robertmaxrees: yeah
[13:30:40] <ExtraSteve> He wants to reinvent the wheel
[13:30:45] <robertmaxrees> just embed irc or use slack and don't put it on your site.
[13:30:46] <ExtraSteve> Which may be fun, but it's not the best way :p
[13:30:49] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[13:30:53] <ExtraSteve> ^^
[13:31:05] <robertmaxrees> don't try to reinvent chat.
[13:31:42] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: nee maybe use cookie too, for each client create cookie and write there messages and if he got message return request instantly without nothing
[13:32:16] <Neo1> ok, will later trying build, maybe
[13:32:49] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: but chat is easy do, it seems a few row of code
[13:32:50] <ExtraSteve> I think you're making this harder than it needs to be :p
[13:33:03] <Neo1> ))) no
[13:33:30] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 it's not a "few row of code"
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:34:19] <Neo1> I seem a few
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:35:00] <ExtraSteve> Sometimes I wish I spoke russian
[13:35:26] <Neo1> two ajax handler - two php files for put and for get, and one table in database for message
[13:35:33] <robertmaxrees> not that simple.
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta track users.
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ajax is gonna be leaky.
[13:35:57] <robertmaxrees> for memory management.
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> which is a concern because you're relying on people keeping a browser window open for a long time.
[13:36:41] <ExtraSteve> And it will kill your server if someone opens your website 100 times
[13:36:51] <ExtraSteve> 100 queries per second...
[13:37:02] <Neo1> and when people choose other tab timer will not work?
[13:37:25] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 yep.  you're have cross-browser issues out the behind
[13:37:28] <robertmaxrees> *you'll
[13:37:34] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: yes, see need also track user IP
[13:37:46] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 and then map those IPs to user names.
[13:37:47] <Neo1> and allow only one request
[13:37:59] <Neo1> it's maybe not easy :(
[13:38:11] <ExtraSteve> Again, you can solve this in one line of code:
[13:38:12] <ExtraSteve> <iframe src="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.kiwiirc.com/#your_channel" style="border:0; width:100%; height:450px;"></iframe>
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:38:47] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: but I can't customize that chat, own better
[13:39:04] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 own is NOT better in this case.
[13:39:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to customize it so bad?
[13:39:39] <ExtraSteve> mibbit has customization: https://widgetmanager.mibbit.com/?view=createacc
[13:39:47] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: oh see that chat is looked good, like real
[13:40:01] <ExtraSteve> And kiwi is open source: https://github.com/prawnsalad/KiwiIRC
[13:40:01] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: kiwiirc, really cool
[13:40:13] <ExtraSteve> So you could download it and change the css
[13:40:20] <Neo1> mibbit I know, it's looked bad
[13:40:49] <ExtraSteve> Most reddit communities use kiwi
[13:41:54] <Neo1> ExtraSteve: what is reddit communities? it's people from this site? https://www.reddit.com/
[13:42:00] <ExtraSteve> yeah
[13:42:18] <ExtraSteve> It's like, the third most popular website in the world..
[13:42:22] * taplar needs an after lunch nap
[13:42:22] <ExtraSteve> Next to google and facebook
[13:42:23] <ExtraSteve> :p
[13:42:36] <ExtraSteve> I think it's even more popular than amazon
[13:42:36] <Neo1> I didn't know this
[14:00:31] <altblew> I have a simple fade to next image slider https://codepen.io/bryanlewis/pen/eGVRYw - In safari it seems to not be fading like I'd hope. On line 33 in the JS I think is where I'm having issue but I can't seem to figure out whats going on with a breakpoint and was hoping I could score a little help
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to wait until the fade is done before adding that class?
[14:04:21] <altblew> yea
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> addClass won't wait for that fade.
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> it fires immediately.
[14:04:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta use a callback on fade.
[14:04:53] <altblew> I'm fading out - removing the class
[14:04:55] <altblew> ohhhh
[14:05:08] <altblew> you mean in nextItem var?
[14:05:18] <altblew> on the fadeOut put a function in there?
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> or use https://api.jquery.com/promise/
[14:05:57] <robertmaxrees> .fadeIn('slow').promise().then(function() {});
[14:06:20] <altblew> will try this! thanks!
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll wanna do that whenever you want to wait for a jquery animation to finish.
[14:06:32] <robertmaxrees> so you have a few spots in your code to fix :)
[14:07:27] <taplar> i feel like two different developers worked on this
[14:07:31] <altblew> oh my, okay! haha
[14:07:37] <taplar> just looking at the if vs the else logic
[14:07:54] <altblew> is there a better way to go?
[14:08:12] <taplar> well i mean you got a non-jquery block, and a jquery block
[14:08:17] <taplar> just inconsistent
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> if wer're going there - don't use carousels at all ;)
[14:08:40] <altblew> I see yea, I got that polyfill from google
[14:09:06] <altblew> haha I'd agree with that @robertmaxrees
[14:10:15] <taplar> also to make it a little smaller you could use $().each() for the top part if you wanted to change it to jquery, or if you wanted to stay vanilla you use use Array.prototype.forEach.apply( ... ) to use a forEach rather than a for ()
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> taplar since it's a polyfill you generally want to avoid stuff like that imo.
[14:10:52] <taplar> which one?
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> objectFit Polyfill
[14:11:17] <robertmaxrees> at the top of that codepen
[14:11:22] <taplar> no, i mean which change?
[14:11:30] <robertmaxrees> apply
[14:11:48] <taplar> i can see that
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> and i wouldn't use jquery as apart of a polyfill either.
[14:12:20] <altblew> yea, I thought about using a plugin for a polyfill just include it but this seems small enough?
[14:12:24] <taplar> which would mean the else would need to be refactored
[14:12:43] <robertmaxrees> i just wouldn't touch the polyfill imo.
[14:12:50] <robertmaxrees> altblew well
[14:13:09] <robertmaxrees> that depends on the project imoi
[14:13:11] <robertmaxrees> *imo
[14:15:28] <taplar> are the number of background images variable?
[14:18:51] <altblew> I mean, right now we are only rotating 2 images in one section.
[14:19:23] <altblew> I didn't know how to rotate the background images with transition in css because background images are supported in transitions
[14:19:35] <altblew> so I went this route with objectFit
[14:20:07] <altblew> I'm open to reworking it, just need get ideas
[14:20:09] <taplar> ^ that's what i'm tinkering
[14:20:13] <taplar> *with
[14:20:19] <altblew> the flicker is bugging me.
[14:20:25] <altblew> Thank you!
[14:30:34] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VMQWNX   eh?
[14:31:20] <viran> Hey, I'm accessing a textarea and setting its content using $('#text-area').val('content') .. I'd like to set focus and place the cursor at the end of the cursor... cant get it done, $.focus() does not have an effect...
[14:34:22] <taplar> setting the cursor position would be more ##javascript related
[14:34:52] <taplar> you're going to be changing the selectionStart and related property on the textarea, iirc
[14:34:58] <altblew> @taplar I didn't think animation worked on background images - let me check it in firefox
[14:35:28] <taplar> that's not a true background image
[14:35:33] <taplar> it's just <img> on your page
[14:35:49] <viran> taplar: i've tried everything, something's blocking the event... (doing a chrome extension..)
[14:36:19] <altblew> huh, I don't mind that solution. good point.
[14:36:24] <altblew> let me try it out.
[14:36:46] <taplar> you can play around with the % in the keyframes to see if you can get a better fade in if you like
[14:36:55] <taplar> 40% and 60% weren't bad either
[14:37:01] <taplar> imho
[14:37:50] <taplar> viran: 'the event' ?
[14:38:15] <altblew> I'd still need a polyfill for IE but I like this solution
[14:38:43] <taplar> altblew: and opacity transformation are super gpu effective, :D
[14:39:21] <altblew> haha I was wondering why my fan was running
[14:39:24] <altblew> :-/
[14:40:43] <taplar> i'm on an animation kick, so these things are fun, :)
[14:40:54] <viran> taplar: $('#textarea-chat').trigger({type: 'keypress', which: 13, keyCode: 13}); does not focus the textarea
[14:41:50] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement
[14:41:57] <taplar> search 'selectionStart' and 'selectionEnd'
[14:42:33] <altblew> yea, I might use this as a solution and leave the objectFit polyfill in there for IE just take out the jquery code
[14:44:13] <altblew> just so I know whats going on - the 2nd image in css is starting to show 7 secs in on top of the other image?
[14:44:18] <altblew> oh wait no
[14:44:30] <altblew> they start alternating opacity in and out
[14:44:43] <altblew> you just start it at a different time
[14:44:47] <taplar> viran: related  https://jsfiddle.net/0d79j6br/
[14:44:51] <taplar> altblew: yep
[14:45:15] <viran> taplar: thanks
[14:45:32] <altblew> if I add another image I need to add 7 more sec and then nth-type-of(3) will start at 14s?
[14:45:49] <taplar> yep, :)
[14:45:59] <altblew> that's nifty!
[14:46:02] <taplar> but your % would have to change too
[14:46:03] <altblew> Thank you!
[14:46:11] <altblew> ahhh
[14:46:13] <taplar> cause now your time is divided ruffly by 1/3
[14:46:24] <altblew> 33%
[14:46:33] <taplar> which is why this approach only really works well with non-variable number of images
[14:46:46] <altblew> I see.
