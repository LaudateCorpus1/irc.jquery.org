[08:50:55] <nsh> how can i load jquery into a page via dev console despite content-security-policy?
[08:51:16] <Cork> depends on the security policy
[08:51:20] <nsh> other than manually pasting the whole things
[08:51:23] <Cork> if it allows inline script you can inject it
[08:51:32] <Cork> if it doesn't; you would have to modify the policy
[08:51:54] <nsh> hmm
[08:52:00] <Cork> nsh: well you have to follow the policy, or use webbrowser options to change it
[08:52:11] <Cork> that is kinda the point of the policies :)
[08:52:52] <nsh> sure
[08:53:08] <nsh> i was just hoping it would be simple to do in dev console, but there's an extension for chrome to disable per site/page
[08:53:10] <nsh> that'll do
[08:53:41] <Cork> i think there are extensions to modify the policy per site too
[08:53:45] <Cork> but never needed it so not sure
[08:53:55] * nsh nods
[10:42:52] <nsh> why would jQuery('span').filter(blah...) give different results based on where i am scrolled in the page?
[10:43:11] <nsh> is the site unloading html and reloading it when you change scroll position
[10:43:16] <nsh> can't think of what else it could be
[10:43:53] <nsh> jQuery("span").filter(function() { return (jQuery(this).text() === 'Follow')}).length // 0 // jQuery("span").filter(function() { return (jQuery(this).text() === 'Follow')}).length // 70
[10:44:06] <nsh> all i did between was click up a bit in the scroll bar
[10:44:56] <nsh> you know sometimes i think twitter actually isn't especially keen on me doing things automatically outside of their stupid API
[10:45:21] <nsh> oh well, i've hit the daily hard limit on follows anyway so it's by-the-by until tomorrow
[11:13:49] <mrsxypants> Hi guys, I'm having an issue where I'm using two version of jQuery (using noConflict), when I attempt to use a plugin (jsTree) with the 2nd jQuery version I'm getting a "VM6980:1699 Uncaught jsTree cookie: jQuery cookie plugin not included." and I've tried everything I can think of to get jquery.cookie to work (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/src/jquery.cookie.js) with my 2nd version of
[11:13:51] <mrsxypants> jQ exclusively but I've been unsuccessful- any help would be appreciated
[11:26:43] <Cork> mrsxypants: you have to include it in the page after the correct version of jquery is loaded
[11:26:54] <Cork> if you need it for both, you will have to include it twoce
[11:27:03] <Cork> *twice
[11:27:33] <Cork> (and this is why using more then one version of jquery isn't really recommended as it explodes the memory usage)
[11:32:17] <mrsxypants> Cork: i hate it, it's for a splunk app though, and Splunk is weird. How should I go about including it for the correct version, I'm going to paste a snippet as to what i have to bring in my version
[11:32:58] <Cork> mrsxypants: if it is the first version you include, add the <script> for the plugin before the second one
[11:33:12] <Cork> if it is for the second, add it before you call noConflict()
[11:34:05] <Cork> if that doesn't work, the plugin MIGHT be written to not support multiple versions of jquery (not written according to recommendations)
[11:36:32] <mrsxypants> hmm
[11:36:41] <mrsxypants> https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/blob/v1.5.1/src/js.cookie.js
[11:36:49] <mrsxypants> how can i tell if it's written to support multiple versions?
[11:39:27] <Cork> you would have to check what instance of $ and jQuery the code ends up using
[11:39:48] <mrsxypants> ok
[11:39:54] <Cork> that specific version is written around require so it might actually load it's own version
[11:40:05] <Cork> depending on how the page is configured
[11:40:09] <mrsxypants> ok
[11:40:12] <mrsxypants> thanks for the help
[11:40:14] <mrsxypants> really appreciate it
[11:40:16] <Cork> np
[12:59:35] <mrsxypants> Cork: when you said "that specific version is written around require so it might actually load it's own version" do you know of a jquery.cookie version that doesn't?
[13:02:15] <robertmaxrees> mrsxypants any reason you're using a plugin that's been superceded by something else?
[13:02:23] <robertmaxrees> can bypass the issue entirely it looks like.
[13:04:44] <mrsxypants> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to use jstree within a Splunk app, and the version of jQuery that Splunk uses doesn't work, so I am bringing in my own version of jQ, after bringing in jstree plugin the .jstree() method works, but it throws an error about jquery.cookie; i've tried w/ the requirejs version of jsTree but i get even more nebulous errors with that lol
[13:04:55] <mrsxypants> thank you for taking the time to inquire btw robertmaxrees
[13:05:27] <robertmaxrees> so you're actually trying to fix an issue with jstree, not the cookie plugin directly.
[13:07:11] <mrsxypants> right
[13:07:15] <mrsxypants> just trying to make jstree work
[13:07:28] <mrsxypants> i'm so close dude rofl this splunk app has been an absolute nightmare
[13:08:46] <robertmaxrees> why not use a different tree library?
[13:11:11] <mrsxypants> i couldn't find any that looked as good
[13:11:29] <mrsxypants> the client wants me to recreate this - http://sadjad.me/phd/
[13:11:32] <mrsxypants> when you click the decode button
[13:11:36] <mrsxypants> it decodes that PDU
[13:11:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> something is going to have to give here imho.
[13:13:21] <mrsxypants> yea
[13:13:33] <mrsxypants> you may be right, you have any tree plugins in mind?
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> google search comes up with https://github.com/finom/vanillatree, http://www.treejs.cn/v3/demo.php#_101, http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/
[13:19:34] <robertmaxrees> etc
[13:27:55] <mrsxypants> thanks, i thought you had one in particular that you've used. I'll check these out, thanks for your help
[14:58:53] <linux_daemon> hello guys, i am using selectric, and i initialize the plugin like: $("#select-states").append(states_selectric).selectric({ . how can i set which option is selected?
[15:00:06] <robertmaxrees> https://selectric.js.org/ shows a few different ways.
[15:00:39] <robertmaxrees> oh - set the option  try $('#select-states').val()
[15:01:26] <linux_daemon> let me try
[15:04:30] <linux_daemon> with val it is not setting the value
[15:04:41] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[15:06:00] <linux_daemon> just a sec
[15:07:19] <linux_daemon> fiddlejsfiddle doesnt support selectric...
[15:07:27] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[15:07:29] <linux_daemon> i am gonna add the fiddle anyway
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it?
[15:07:35] <linux_daemon> it isnt in the list
[15:08:07] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/5w4R3nQ.png
[15:08:11] <robertmaxrees> that's what the resources box is for.
[15:09:10] <linux_daemon> ah
[15:09:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gf51ermL/1/ like this
[15:10:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gf51ermL/2/
[15:10:26] <robertmaxrees> you use .val() and then refresh.
[15:11:28] <linux_daemon> https://jsfiddle.net/wyro654h/
[15:11:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at my example
[15:11:43] <linux_daemon> it is not reading the lodash or i am doing something wrong in the fiddle
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> you're not including lodash...
[15:12:18] <robertmaxrees> but look at my second fiddle above
[15:12:49] <linux_daemon> i changed that one, added on the left lodash
[15:13:01] <robertmaxrees> you have to save and share a new URL.
[15:13:02] <adder> how can I modify this line `$(document).on('change', 'select', $r_);` to include only selects whose id contains a number? I tried $(document).on('change', $('select:regex(id,[0-9])');, $r_); with the regex selector
[15:13:04] <linux_daemon> but the dropdown is not generated
[15:13:07] <linux_daemon> let me try
[15:13:13] <robertmaxrees> and why are you ignoring the example I gave you linux_daemon?
[15:13:40] <linux_daemon> on the second fiddle?
[15:13:47] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon yeah
[15:13:53] <robertmaxrees> adder you don't use $() in that secord arg.
[15:14:01] <robertmaxrees> adder just give it the string.
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> adder also: i might instead either a: move that logic into the handler and return if the select doesn't match, or b: just put a class on the selects you want.
[15:14:54] <linux_daemon> ok, let me try with refresh
[15:14:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd favor option b if i were you :)
[15:15:48] <adder> robertmaxrees: thanks, this works. might I ask you to elaborate a little bit?
[15:15:56] <robertmaxrees> adder what do you mean?
[15:16:54] <adder> robertmaxrees: "just put a class on the selects you want." that's what I meant, I don't understand.
[15:17:07] <robertmaxrees> <select class="foo"> ...
[15:17:24] <linux_daemon> it's working now, with the refresh, thanks robertmaxrees
[15:17:25] <adder> ...yes? and then?
[15:17:31] <linux_daemon> i owe you a beer :)
[15:17:44] <robertmaxrees> adder and then use that class in the second arg to .on() instead.
[15:17:56] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('change', .foo', $r_)
[15:18:05] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon all good :)
[15:18:06] <adder> robertmaxrees: how is that different to using ids?
[15:18:32] <robertmaxrees> adder for starters, it's much easier to read.  it also makes your markup far more semantic.
[15:18:42] <adder> I should mention that these selects are dynamically generated
[15:18:54] <adder> each select is a part of chained dependent combobox selection
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> adder that doesn't change anything about my advice.
[15:19:08] <adder> let's see
[15:20:22] <adder> I see what you mean, you're right. thanks for the help and the advice
[15:20:35] <adder> no need for regex selector
[15:21:21] <robertmaxrees> exactly :)
[16:12:01] <mrsxypants> ughhh, so i was able past the jquery.cookie issue
[16:12:15] <mrsxypants> but now another one
[16:13:44] <mrsxypants> i hate itttt
[16:16:15] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:53:25] <mrsxypants> i think i'm going to use this - https://www.cssscript.com/demo/collapsible-folder-tree-pure-javascript-jslists/
[16:53:43] <mrsxypants> thank you for all your help guys

[19:00:22] <inv3nt0r> Good evening folks. Can someone point me in the right direction as to how I would put a set of tabs on a website? I'm running jQuery-UI / Bootstrap and figured it would be basic... But for whatever reason I can't make it work.
[19:02:36] <inv3nt0r> Running jQuery v1.12.4 / Bootstrap v3.3.7 / jQuery UI Core 1.11.4
[19:02:53] <inv3nt0r> Is it possible that I'm missing a script?
[19:03:18] <inv3nt0r> I get this console error on click: jQuery(...).tab is not a function
[19:09:22] <inv3nt0r> Got it working. I now know that jQuery UI core doesn't include the widgets. Lesson learned.
[20:18:34] <ThatWebGuy> I have list of 10 items.  4 are show and the other 6 have a class of hidden.  I'm trying to find the best way to toggle the hidden class off of the elements when a button is clicked.  I've tried toggle with `hidden show` but it turns the 4 off and then turns the other 6 on.
