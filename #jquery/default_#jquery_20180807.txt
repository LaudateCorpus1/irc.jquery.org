[00:28:27] <Lenswipee> hi, is this the best way to detect pressing of enter key? see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/979662/how-to-detect-pressing-enter-on-keyboard-using-jquery
[00:33:03] <Lenswipee> here is another using .on(), see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14919459/using-jquery-on-to-watch-for-enter-key-press
[00:33:17] <Lenswipee> is there a preference for these?
[01:24:38] <Lenswipee> how to find next element, not the first, say p.foo?
[01:28:38] <Woet> Lenswipee: what did you Google for so far?
[01:29:13] <Lenswipee> something about nextAll and using first()
[01:30:04] <Lenswipee> Woet: what function should i be using?
[01:30:21] <Woet> Lenswipee: the first result of "jquery get next element"
[01:32:09] <Lenswipee> .next() did nothing...strange
[01:32:28] <Lenswipee> Woet: $('span.ui-button-text').next().click();
[01:33:31] <Woet> Lenswipee: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[01:34:53] <Lenswipee> Woet: trying to trigger send button on jquery dialog. jquery has added a close and send button in the dialog, and i'm trying to trigger the second button, which is the send using the code above
[01:35:42] <Lenswipee> Woet: $('span.ui-button-text').click(); <-- this will close dialog works OK
[01:35:56] <Woet> Lenswipee: why can't you just use the close method..?
[01:36:21] <Lenswipee> Woet: $('span.ui-button-text').next().click(); <-- this does not trigger send button - NOT OK
[01:37:13] <Lenswipee> Woet: yes, just an example to see if code works but yes use the close method. is there a way to specify the send button?
[01:38:16] <Woet> Lenswipee: apparently the 2nd match for "span.ui-button-text" doesn't match the send button.
[01:38:49] <Lenswipee> Woet: buttons: {
[01:38:50] <Lenswipee> Close: function() {}, Send: function() {}, ...
[01:39:00] <Woet> Lenswipee: what is that supposed to tell me/
[01:39:17] <Lenswipee> jquery doesn't add classes to these so i can't easily trigger them
[01:40:01] <Woet> Lenswipee: then why do you expect $('span.ui-button-text').next().click(); to work
[01:40:10] <Woet> Lenswipee: and, I ask again, why can't you just use the dialog method..?
[01:40:39] <pavonia> Aren't there actual <button> elements?
[01:40:55] <Lenswipee> Woet: example?
[01:41:31] <Woet> Lenswipee: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[01:41:55] <Lenswipee> pavonia: yes they wrap around the span and again specific classes to differentiate close and send
[01:42:26] <Woet> Lenswipee: it would be great if you could start asking questions that reflect what you're trying to do, not the weird way you thought of solving it.
[01:43:12] <Lenswipee> <Lenswipee> Woet: trying to trigger send button on jquery dialog. jquery has added a close and send button in the dialog, and i'm trying to trigger the second button, which is the send using the code above
[01:43:39] <Lenswipee> i've created a custom send button in a jquery dialog that i would like to trigger
[01:44:28] <Lenswipee> you think it would be something easy to do but no
[01:45:37] <pavonia> $("button:contains('Send')").click()?
[01:46:17] <Lenswipee> i'll try that
[01:46:21] <Woet> Lenswipee: why don't you turn that into a function so you can call it from anywhere?
[01:46:28] <Woet> Lenswipee: Send: function(){ whateverYouWant(); }
[01:47:17] <Lenswipee> oh that could work too
[01:47:34] <Lenswipee> Woet: that is smart
[01:50:18] <Lenswipee> pavonia: didn't work. the way jquery appends buttons to bottom of dialog is weird
[08:26:51] <how2hack> hi, can anyone help me with a problem? i've been trying to figure it out since yesterday...
[08:26:57] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/19/
[08:29:17] <how2hack> the problem is when i click the third or fourth header column and then the first one, the last console.log() is undefined, the expected behavior is what happens when i click the second header column and then the first one
[08:31:12] <how2hack> sorry, not that one, this one https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/18/
[09:36:59] <AdamPDotty> how2hack: as long as there is no data-dortby, jquery will find none
[09:37:19] <how2hack> that's not it
[09:37:25] <how2hack> but i've actually found the problem
[09:37:43] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/ line 13
[09:38:07] <how2hack> isSet = all.parent().not('li.coin-profile').find('span').data('sortby') <-- this is only affecting the first span from the first li match
[09:38:11] <how2hack> is that right?
[09:39:10] <AdamPDotty> Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements or return the value at the named data store for the first element in the set of matched elements.
[09:39:38] * AdamPDotty reads "first".
[09:42:01] <how2hack> i'm getting lost here, do you mind providing an example?
[09:42:49] <AdamPDotty> Well, you could start with explaining what you want to achieve.
[09:44:03] <how2hack> yes ofc, the first column should reset the sorting of the other three, by executing the if, that's why i put the OR and made the condition isSet
[09:44:51] <how2hack> if any of these three columns is currently sorting, the next click on the first column should execute the if instead of the else
[09:49:20] <how2hack> it's just a condition: if ... OR this is first column and the other three columns spans have data-sortby
[09:53:16] <how2hack> any of the other*
[09:59:08] <AdamPDotty> hmm, looks like some architectural issues
[09:59:29] <AdamPDotty> first of seems tabular data is intended, that is what tables are for
[09:59:45] <how2hack> like "don't store logic in the UI", for example?
[09:59:57] <AdamPDotty> store the sorting configuration in the main element, not the parts
[10:00:57] <AdamPDotty> here: <article datasorton="<current-sorted-column>" class="asc">
[10:01:24] <AdamPDotty> "coin-" is repeating, but that is just a bad taste
[10:02:10] <how2hack> i can remove that from the lis
[10:02:54] <AdamPDotty> if you have the class corresponding to the sorton, you could just go if (self.hasClass(self.data('sorton'))) â€¦
[10:03:29] <AdamPDotty> toggleClass('asc');
[10:03:35] <how2hack> hmm i can't store sorton in the article, that needs to be static from the html, what can be stored in the article is sortby
[10:04:18] <how2hack> the logic is mainly about sortby
[10:04:26] <AdamPDotty> maybe store it in the header, but it looks like you should use a table anyways
[10:05:35] <AdamPDotty> pus: end commands with ;
[10:05:55] <AdamPDotty> l
[10:06:21] <AdamPDotty> hmm, gotta leave now, but there are probably practical examples out there
[10:25:22] <royalty> suppose i am using a plugin like datetimepicker
[10:25:35] <royalty> and i am adding things via js that i want a working datetimepicker on
[10:25:43] <royalty> how to load without constantly rebinding?
[10:27:17] <taplar> you have to initialize any element you want to use a plugin on
[10:28:18] <royalty> so if a new element is introduced to the dom
[10:28:26] <royalty> that i want to use the plugin
[10:28:32] <royalty> i always have to re-initialize?
[10:28:43] <taplar> there is no "re".  It's the first time for that element
[10:28:57] <royalty> can't i do something with $('#parent-element').on() and target the datepickers
[10:29:09] <royalty> i see what you mean
[10:29:51] <royalty> is there an event for .on() that simply searches for changes and updates
[10:30:14] <royalty> so i could put code for initializing the datepicker in the "on" function/method
[10:30:17] <taplar> no, there is nothing with jquery that automatically detects changes to the dom
[10:30:30] <royalty> i see, then how does .on() work?
[10:30:49] <royalty> because i don't have to rebind if i use .on() when i create elements with ajax for example
[10:30:52] <taplar> you bind an event handler to the elements it finds in the dom, and it processes the event when it happens for that element
[10:31:17] <royalty> i see
[10:31:19] <taplar> if you use a *delegate* version of on, you are still binding on an existing element, but the parent
[10:32:02] <royalty> hmmm, but i can only delegate one of the existing events
[10:32:03] <royalty> right
[10:32:12] <taplar> you can only bind on something that exists, yes
[10:32:17] <royalty> ok
[10:41:35] <how2hack> hmm how can i make var foo = selector.each() return true or false?
[10:41:52] <taplar> you don't.  each doesn't have a return
[10:42:16] <taplar> what are you trying to test?
[10:42:37] <how2hack> i need a condition
[10:43:20] <how2hack> i have three elements, one of them may have a data-attritube set, i need to know if it is or not
[10:43:36] <taplar> then you can do a filter
[10:44:13] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ ...return true if the attribute is set... }).length
[10:44:56] <how2hack> would filter(data('key')) work?
[10:45:18] <taplar> no.  data() isn't a stand-alone method.  ???
[10:45:31] <taplar> also filter expects either a selector or a callback method
[10:45:49] <how2hack> oh, then i guess it goes inside the callback method
[10:51:13] <how2hack> at last it is working, thanks
[10:51:20] <taplar> sure
[11:06:24] <how2hack> i'm curious, is $('span').data() supposed to only return the value for the first match in a set of matched elements?
[11:06:41] <how2hack> why shouldn't it return for each one?
[11:06:58] <taplar> data() is intended to return *the* value of an element
[11:07:06] <taplar> not multiple
[11:09:18] <how2hack> oh right it says it in the docs, but there are actually two entries for data https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/ and https://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:09:33] <how2hack> i was reading the first one, that doesn't mention it
[11:10:25] <taplar> "the specified element"
[11:10:36] <taplar> no where does it say "elements"
[11:11:12] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:11:23] <taplar> "Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements or return the value at the named data store for the first element in the set of matched elements."
[11:11:50] <taplar> $(selector).data() uses that version of data, not the one you linked
[11:12:26] <how2hack> yes, i didn't know there were two entries in the docs
[11:12:42] <taplar> $().data() and $.data()
[11:13:23] <taplar> any time you see a doc for /jquery.* that refers to the $.* version of a method
[11:13:43] <taplar> while /* will refer to a $().* version
[11:16:07] <how2hack> thanks, you're right, i wasn't paying attention, but i'll do from now on (and i'll save these headaches)
[11:16:35] <taplar> it's alright.  just one of those things we have to learn about the library
[11:35:54] <royalty> okay
[11:36:11] <royalty> so i'm not sure how to get this plugin going on my newly added fields
[11:36:18] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/64t0ks7p/34/
[11:36:29] <royalty> it's kind of a mess to see what i mean
[11:36:37] <royalty> you have to click addPromo and after one gets added
[11:36:50] <royalty> you click restrict usage
[11:36:57] <royalty> and there that field below should be a datepicker
[11:37:12] <robertmaxrees> the datetimepicker plugin?
[11:37:51] <royalty> this plugin https://tempusdominus.github.io/bootstrap-4/
[11:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah so
[11:38:13] <royalty> first of all i'd think
[11:38:17] <royalty> this would be handled by clone
[11:38:23] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[11:38:26] <robertmaxrees> inside your add-promo-code click handler
[11:38:29] <robertmaxrees> jkust initialize it.
[11:38:30] <royalty> since i'm cloning an element that already has this functionality
[11:38:38] <royalty> i tried that but it doesn't seem to work
[11:38:58] <taplar> cloning an element does not clone things a plugin may have created related to initialization
[11:39:03] <robertmaxrees> ^'
[11:39:08] <royalty> ugh
[11:39:08] <taplar> the plugin only knows about the things it initialized on
[11:39:09] <royalty> ok
[11:39:11] <robertmaxrees> also:
[11:39:28] <royalty> i'll try it again
[11:39:29] <royalty> and update
[11:39:40] <robertmaxrees> cloning things like you are is generally a bad idea.  cloning is handy for one-offs, but you're getitng into needing a templating engine
[11:39:50] <taplar> I mean, we already talked about this, :)
[11:40:18] <royalty> did we talk about this? lol
[11:40:19] <taplar> granted you said "new elements", and not cloning, but cloning is a "new" element
[11:40:28] <royalty> oh you mean earlier
[11:40:34] <royalty> yeah, yeah
[11:40:57] <royalty> yeah probably a templating engine would be better for this but it's pretty much all built, just need the datepicker
[11:41:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:41:06] <royalty> lol
[11:41:20] <royalty> you'd probably pull your hair out working with me huh?
[11:41:33] <taplar> talking with you, :)
[11:41:37] <taplar> and nah
[11:41:44] <royalty> lol
[11:41:55] <royalty> okay I'll try to re-initialize again
[11:42:55] <royalty> do you think i can add the .datepicker() directly to the clone?
[11:42:58] <royalty> before I add it?
[11:43:02] <royalty> would that be better?
[11:43:02] <taplar> sure
[11:43:06] <taplar> well
[11:43:09] <taplar> i'm not sure
[11:43:22] <taplar> it depends on if the plugin adds more html to the dom related to the element
[11:43:29] <taplar> if it does, it may need to be attached first
[11:43:39] <taplar> you could try it though
[11:44:26] <royalty> ok
[11:47:28] <royalty> doesn't really work after the append
[11:47:30] <royalty> *sigh*
[11:47:35] <robertmaxrees> so then init after the append.
[11:47:40] <robertmaxrees> boom done
[11:47:53] <royalty> i am
[11:47:57] <royalty> lol
[11:48:01] <robertmaxrees> show us then?
[11:48:10] <royalty> maybe i'm doing something wrong with the html for the plugin
[11:48:12] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/64t0ks7p/46/
[11:48:30] <robertmaxrees> wait - are you cloning one that's already been initialized?
[11:48:36] <royalty> yeah
[11:48:42] <robertmaxrees> that can cause problems duder.
[11:48:55] <royalty> okay i'll cut those problem behaviors out then sir
[11:48:56] <robertmaxrees> you're grabbing initilized markup with none of the js.
[11:49:00] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[11:49:12] <royalty> ok, good point
[11:50:10] <royalty> i'll grab unitialized datepicker then
[11:50:12] <royalty> yeeeeee
[11:50:33] <robertmaxrees> this is why templating engines are good
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:51:46] <royalty> yeah that worked
[11:52:05] <royalty> wait it only worked on the first one
[11:52:08] <royalty> oh nooo
[11:52:18] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/64t0ks7p/49/
[11:53:11] <robertmaxrees> try selecting the current one.
[11:53:14] <robertmaxrees> that oyu just added./
[11:53:15] <royalty> yeah
[11:53:16] <robertmaxrees> *you
[11:53:19] <royalty> that would prob be better
[11:53:20] <royalty> heh
[11:54:15] <royalty> yeah
[11:54:16] <royalty> works now
[11:54:20] <royalty> thank the lord
[11:54:35] <robertmaxrees> just need to slow down my dude
[11:55:41] <royalty> I wanna go fast like sanic
[11:55:54] <royalty> ugh what templating stuff do you recommend
[11:55:57] <royalty> for the future
[11:56:06] <royalty> so i don't have to create such a mess
[11:56:32] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[11:56:45] <royalty> okay, well
[11:56:46] <royalty> this case
[11:56:47] <royalty> lol
[11:57:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) without seeing more of the page, I might suggest babel + template literals for something simple, or underscore if you want something slightly more complete.  or you could use one of the dozens of others.
[11:57:52] <robertmaxrees> i like dust.
[11:58:35] <robertmaxrees> riotjs, react, angular, handlebars... tons of frameworks have templating engines baked in.
[12:00:41] <royalty> is it easy to use all of those with jquery?
[12:01:07] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jquery with some of those.
[12:01:19] <robertmaxrees> like angular, react, riot, etc.
[12:01:35] <robertmaxrees> they supercede the need for jquery in the vast majority of cases.
[12:01:39] <royalty> robertmaxrees, thanks for the suggestions
[13:22:28] <how2hack> is it possible to "require" script files without node.js?
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[13:23:32] <how2hack> i'm thinking about using <link rel="preload" or rel="prefetch" and then when i need it i "include" it somehow...
[13:23:59] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want client-side modules.
[13:24:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at setting up webpack and learning how to bundle your client-side dependencies that wayu.
[13:24:28] <robertmaxrees> *way
[13:28:07] <how2hack> ok, i'm gonna check it out
[14:12:13] <Katronix> hi all, having some issues which I'm hoping someone can at least point me in the right direction.
[14:13:53] <taplar> shoot
[14:14:10] <Katronix> If I load jquery on line 12, on line 48 another script is loaded which wants to use " $(".preloader").fadeOut();" it should know what .fadeout is right?
[14:14:36] <taplar> it should
[14:14:49] <taplar> provided you didn't put async on the script tag
[14:14:55] <taplar> or defer, whatever it is
[14:16:12] <Katronix> https://pastebin.com/Yj5tgfyr
[14:16:38] <taplar> you're using the slim version
[14:16:46] <taplar> fadeOut may not be included, apparently
[14:16:49] <Katronix> ok
[14:18:09] <taplar> yeah, slim excludes the ajax and effects methods.  fadeOut is an effect method
[14:18:27] <Katronix> taplar, yes, that appears to be the issue :) taking slim out of the url fixed that issue :)
[14:20:44] <Katronix> another odd issue, jquery is loaded first, after that I load all the other js files. I have several reference errors that either jquery or $ is unknown
[14:21:20] <taplar> you are loading jQuery or are you on a wordpress site?
[14:21:50] <Katronix> I'm using <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
[14:22:00] <Katronix> and actually building an alternative to WP lol
[14:22:51] <taplar> k, well if that is pulling it in correctly, and you are not doing a noConflict call, jQuery should be registered to both jQuery and $ on the window
[14:23:53] <taplar> i tried that import on a fiddle and the integrity check failed
[14:25:04] <Katronix> that would cause most browsers not to use it right?
[14:25:35] <taplar> if the integrity check fails I would assume it wouldn't work for any browser.  where did you get that hash from?
[14:26:55] <Katronix> it came with the bootstrap theme I'm using
[14:27:19] <Katronix> looks like I can just take off everything after .js" and just close the tag there
[14:28:06] <taplar> how critical is jquery to your application?
[14:28:48] <Katronix> extremely
[14:29:11] <Katronix> Bootstrap itself needs it so even if I didn't have all the extra bootstrap stuff, would still need it
[14:29:11] <taplar> then i would highly recommend you download a copy of the version you want to use and serve it up from your own server.
[14:29:23] <Katronix> okay
[14:29:25] <taplar> CDNs, while useful, can go down temporarily
[14:29:32] <Katronix> true
[14:29:57] <Katronix> I did find that the official jquery cdn doesn't actually use the integrity check
[14:30:27] <taplar> i've never really used the integrity check, myself
[14:30:43] <taplar> but i've never really been concerned with man in the middle attacks from script includes
[14:31:08] <taplar> if you serve the file yourself you don't need it at all
[14:31:40] <Katronix> true
[15:20:06] <d[10]> Anyone use semantic-ui ?
