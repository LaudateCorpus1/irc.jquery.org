[07:25:04] <codecutter> all three function react to a click of list item, so when li.one is clicked the function showPriceChart() is called which hides the content of. the other 2 'li' items displays the content of the chart. This is repeated for the other to li's.
[07:25:39] <codecutter> I'm trying to add a slide left animation for the li that is being shown https://pastebin.com/7fxXcDPE
[07:34:07] <codecutter> Cork: u there>
[07:34:08] <codecutter> ?
[09:49:55] <codecutter> add animate slide left if liTwo or liThree is clicked and slide right if liOne is active https://jsfiddle.net/Lugtnmqb/
[09:51:07] <codecutter> one of the bottom containers are shown depending on which link is clicked. I want the container to be animated
[09:58:52] <codecutter> anyone?
[10:32:12] <codecutter> where is everyione?
[13:33:45] <codecutter> any suggestions? (see above)
[13:50:57] <Feldmaus> Which question?
[13:52:32] <codecutter> [14:50:06]  <codecutter> add animate slide left if liTwo or liThree is clicked and slide right if liOne is active https://jsfiddle.net/Lugtnmqb/
[13:52:32] <codecutter> [14:51:18]  <codecutter> one of the bottom containers are shown depending on which link is clicked. I want the container to be animated
[13:52:40] <codecutter> Feldmaus ^
[13:53:52] <codecutter> when you click on link 2 or 3, the container should slide left into view, if link 1, slide right
[13:56:15] <Feldmaus> Don't know, sorry
[13:56:27] <codecutter> Cork: u there?
[14:54:55] <snatcher> is there a way to iterate/get N first $objects of jquery object?
[14:55:09] <codecutter> any lightweight alternative to jquery ui's slide function?
[14:56:02] <codecutter> effect*
[14:56:45] <codecutter> e.g. I have to import the entire ui lib to do this ...  $('.contOne').show("slide", {direction: "right"}, 100);
[15:13:53] <taplar> codecutter here's a quick little edit I made to your fiddle.  https://jsfiddle.net/fbv4mL57/
[15:14:50] <codecutter> tapler: is this just jquery?
[15:14:54] <taplar> yeah
[15:14:54] <codecutter> i.e. ni. ui?
[15:14:57] <codecutter> kewl
[15:15:01] <codecutter> thx man
[15:15:03] <taplar> animate is a jQuery core method
[15:19:22] <taplar> snatcher what are you trying to do?
[15:36:04] <codecutter> tapler: whats does  width: 100vw; do?
[15:37:44] <codecutter> nvm
[15:55:51] <codecutter> tapler: no other way?]
[15:56:23] <codecutter> i would prefer it if content div's remains blocks
[15:56:43] <codecutter>  https://jsfiddle.net/Lugtnmqb/
[15:59:27] <taplar> possibly, but blocks by default force the next element to go down the page, not stay on the same line
[15:59:40] <taplar> you'd have to compensate for that some other way if you left them as block
[16:01:23] <codecutter> do you know, slide effect in jquery's ui is perfect but its to fat
[16:02:27] <codecutter> would it be possible to use just the effects without having to import the entire thing?
[16:02:51] <taplar> not sure without digging into it myself.
[16:05:01] <codecutter> tapler: I can customise the download (see link) but  not sure about which ones to check or uncheck to make the effect work https://jqueryui.com/download/
[16:09:02] <dw1> copy the slide function ( ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ)
[16:10:57] <dw1> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js
[16:11:08] <dw1> jQuery UI Effects Slide 1.12.1 section
[16:11:13] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:11:33] <dw1> it's like 40 lines
[16:11:46] <dw1> 35
[16:43:16] <codecutter> tapler: have a look at this
[16:43:29] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/wn1ahz80/
[16:43:43] <codecutter> each. click display a chart
[16:44:20] <codecutter> the layout is pretty much similar to the actual mark up
[16:45:28] <taplar> those divs still exist, so I would expect the logic I spiked out earlier would work with that.
[16:46:10] <codecutter> it fails
[16:46:15] <codecutter> try it
[16:46:53] <codecutter> ideally it would be a block
[16:51:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ej9durnv/  works fine
[16:58:54] <codecutter> thx
