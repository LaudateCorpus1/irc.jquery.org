[13:00:31] <taplar> nah, this is second stage unhappy marriage right there
[13:00:36] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:19:06] <z1haze> 2 questions here: 1. Is it possible to do a global .ajax config beforeSend on ALL jquery.ajax calls, including getJSON, or any other shortcut method. and 2. is it possible to run an to do something async in this global config, and only send after its resolved?
[14:20:16] <z1haze> My scenario: I have a js application on an ecommerce site, that has soft timeouts after 30 minutes, and we dont want to force customers to reload their page, or whatever, so I want to wake a session up if its expired before sending requests
[14:20:46] <z1haze> Plans are to have a hidden field on the page with seconds to soft expiration, and if its after that time, we wake it up, then allow the call to be made, etc
[14:25:13] <taplar> beforeSend, iirc, affects all ajax calls
[14:25:37] <shoky> z1haze:  1. yes, see https://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/   2.  no
[14:25:51] <taplar> or actually i'm thinking of ajaxSetup()
[14:25:59] <z1haze> yeah i see the global ajaxSend
[14:26:19] <z1haze> so shoky. if 2 is no.. what do you suggest?
[14:27:59] <taplar> so, hold on, you're trying to cause a session to be extended?
[14:28:08] <z1haze> just trying to wake it back up
[14:28:22] <z1haze> PCI says they must 'soft' expire after 30 minutes of idle
[14:28:33] <z1haze> but they can be recovered
[14:28:40] <shoky> so you want to go against PCI?
[14:28:46] <z1haze> um. no.
[14:29:07] <shoky> you want to automatically extend it over 30 minutes if the user is idle?
[14:29:13] <z1haze> NO.
[14:29:31] <z1haze> I want them if they come back after 30 minutes and try to resume action, it wakes their session back up so they can perform an action
[14:29:45] <taplar> what happens if you do not wake the session up?
[14:29:45] <shoky> a session doesn't sleep and wake up.
[14:29:57] <shoky> it starts and then it ends.
[14:30:21] <z1haze> well, i assume you, you're incorrect. my terminology may be be precise on 'sleep' and 'wakeup' but it most definitely can
[14:30:42] <z1haze> Like I stated before, PCI says a session has a hard timeout after 6 hours
[14:30:43] <shoky> then what does it mean for it to be "asleep"..?
[14:30:48] <z1haze> and a soft timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
[14:30:51] <z1haze> sure
[14:31:02] <z1haze> for logged in users, it would kick them back to a login page, or an 'extend you session' message
[14:31:05] <z1haze> like most banks do, etc
[14:31:16] <z1haze> but for guests, we dont need to do that, we just want to wake it back up
[14:31:30] <shoky> now i'm more confused ;|
[14:31:44] <z1haze> its really not that complicated
[14:31:59] <shoky> possibly, i haven't eaten yet today
[14:32:02] <z1haze> PCI doesnt change because a customer is logged in or a guest
[14:32:09] <z1haze> but the action needed to be taken does change
[14:32:18] <z1haze> if the customer was logged in, they would need to of course reauthenticate
[14:32:42] <shoky> <taplar> what happens if you do not wake the session up?
[14:32:43] <z1haze> but guests, they dont need to do shit, because they aren't signed in.. so I just need to make a server call, to reinitialize the session so I can make requests
[14:32:51] <z1haze> the calls fail
[14:33:01] <z1haze> the server attempts to send the guest to the homepage to restart a session
[14:33:32] <taplar> i feel like there is a backend piece missing
[14:33:44] <shoky> why not use larger timeout for guest sessions?
[14:34:31] <z1haze> like i said, PCI has rules to follow
[14:34:52] <z1haze> i cant control how long im allowed to have a session idle for
[14:35:05] <z1haze> well i could, but thats not following the rules.
[14:36:58] <z1haze> so anyway, the plan was to just ping the server when they try to perform an action after being idle for too long, to wake their session back up, and then send our request
[14:37:47] <shoky> sorry, still no idea what waking a session up means
[14:37:48] <taplar> could the endpoint that you are hitting, not check to see if they are sleeping, and if they are, wake them up before it continues?
[14:40:03] <z1haze> taplar, its actually not something I can control. The platform actually does its own blackbox type check and will attempt to send them to the homepage if the session isnt active
[14:40:41] <z1haze> this happens before it even hits the controller
[14:40:49] <z1haze> its some sort of behind the scenes middleware
[14:42:15] <taplar> hmm
[14:42:16] <z1haze> shoky, one more time to try to break it down. Lets say you visit nike.com you immediatly establish a session that will soft timeout in 30 minutes. ok? Then you go to add some items to your cart, then leave your desk for an hour an come back. You come back you can't do anything without refreshing the page, changing page, etc.. because your session had expired, BUT when you do refresh your page, you'll notice your basket still exists as you
[14:42:16] <z1haze> left it
[14:42:29] <z1haze> so there is a difference between a hard session timeout and a soft session timeout
[14:43:15] <z1haze> We have a hard session timeout maxxed out at 6 hours, but you still have to timeout a session after 30 minutes of idle, but that doesnt mean a completely new session is created if they refresh their page, its just woken up
[14:43:23] <z1haze> Its like trying to submit a page with an expired csrf token
[14:43:51] <z1haze> I thought the perfect answer would be a global beforeSend but apparently you can't make that await
[14:44:27] <taplar> we have that concept in some of our apps, but we refer to it as refreshing the session.  the token expires, but we have a secondary token that can be used to get a new one to continue the session
[14:44:57] <taplar> the secondary token has a longer TTL
[14:45:43] <z1haze> sure, i mean terminology call it whatever you want, you refresh, i wake up.. thats just playing semantics.. I'm just happy you understand the behavior
[14:47:18] <z1haze> I just know that the session id hash does not change after a soft expire, to refresh it. that's why I call it wake up
[14:58:28] <shoky> z1haze i guess i'm just not familiar with that. either stuff continues working,  or i am redirected to a page saying the session has expired (or stuff generally stops working).  not familiar with scenarios where doing stuff on the page doesn't work, but it does after a refresh.  i don't really see why a refresh should be special
[15:02:08] <z1haze> because you ping the server and it reinitializes your session
[15:02:25] <z1haze> but when you're in a async/js application clicking these buttons dont make browser page changes, just async calls
[15:02:25] <robertmaxrees> session timeouts?
[15:02:27] <shoky> why is only a refresh considered a "ping" ?
[15:02:34] <shoky> why isn't an action on the page considered a ping
[15:02:37] <z1haze> because you're hiitting the server again
[15:02:44] <shoky> so does an action on the page
[15:02:52] <shoky> without refreshing
[15:02:53] <z1haze> because the action we are trying to make requires the active session
[15:03:02] <z1haze> refreshing the page would not
[15:03:07] <shoky> why should it not become active when doing the action?
[15:03:10] <shoky> why only when refreshing ?
[15:03:12] <z1haze> eg in order to add a item to your cart, you have to have a active session
[15:03:20] <z1haze> because it just doesnt
[15:03:24] <z1haze> PCI reasons
[15:03:25] <shoky> :)
[15:03:34] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that's... what
[15:03:34] <shoky> and so you see my confusion
[15:03:47] <z1haze> PCI reasons says idle says they have to expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
[15:03:57] <z1haze> so if course it cant just reactive on its own without a new server call
[15:04:04] <shoky> "expire"
[15:04:13] <z1haze> soft timeout
[15:04:14] <z1haze> yes
[15:04:15] <shoky> but with a refresh, it's not expired. why? because
[15:04:27] <z1haze> nono, dont conflate that
[15:04:36] <shoky> gtg for a bit
[15:04:41] <z1haze> alright
[15:06:53] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, you work in ecommerce, yeah? Does your add to cart action perform async or sync?
[15:07:14] <robertmaxrees> technically they're all async.
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> so we can show error messages if something breaks.
[15:07:53] <z1haze> So how do you handle an add to cart request after an idle session expires?
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> what part of PCI are you referencing?
[15:08:23] <z1haze> 30 minute idle timeout
[15:08:42] <z1haze> but specicically my case is for a guest, so theres no 'reauth' to show them
[15:09:15] <robertmaxrees> we don't have any provision for that.
[15:09:34] <z1haze> heh
[15:10:27] <z1haze> what do you think would happen in this case?
[15:10:39] <z1haze> my case is the add to cart button just sits there and spins
[15:10:50] <z1haze> because that call never completes
[15:10:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:11:00] <z1haze> we didnt have a fail scenario for that
[15:11:17] <robertmaxrees> because you're not reading all of PCI-DSS :)
[15:11:18] <z1haze> i mean, even if we did whats it gonna say? 'click add to cart again, it will work this time'?
[15:11:25] <shoky> z1haze what was i conflating?
[15:11:39] <z1haze>  the difference between the add to cart call, vs the reload of the product page
[15:11:44] <z1haze> ^ shoky
[15:11:45] <robertmaxrees> z1haze if it's a guest account, it doesn't have any credit card data.
[15:11:54] <shoky> they are both requests to the server :\
[15:12:06] <taplar> some sites let you pay as a guest
[15:12:23] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, yeah technically. but our platform still kills idle sessions at 30 minutes, i have 0 control
[15:12:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze then you need to fix the platform.
[15:12:37] <z1haze> shoky, one is a post request, one is a get request
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar ours does, too.  but you cannot come back and access your credit card data later.
[15:12:46] <shoky> lol..
[15:12:48] <z1haze> one needs the session, one doesn't
[15:12:55] <z1haze> why do you want to argue that
[15:12:56] <taplar> robertmaxrees: oh sure
[15:13:13] <shoky> z1haze just trying to understand..
[15:13:41] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, we cant change session times for guests vs auth users. they are all 15 minute idle timeouts, regardless of what the spec says
[15:13:50] <robertmaxrees> z1haze's issue is their platform is timing out ALL users.  but afaik the timeout stuff only applies to being able to access cc info
[15:14:10] <robertmaxrees> which is inherently flawed.
[15:14:28] <shoky> he said he must "soft timeout" guests too, i donno
[15:14:35] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't make sense.
[15:14:59] <z1haze> im not timing anyone out, its just a 'feature' of the platform
[15:15:01] <robertmaxrees> the timeouts are centered around accessing data - CC and address info, specifically.
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> the platform is broken then (shrug)
[15:16:00] <z1haze> so, robertmaxrees what happens if a guest adds to cart, goes through half of the checkout process, adds their address, name, email etc
[15:16:01] <robertmaxrees> backing up - have you checked your analytics to see how often this actually comes up?
[15:16:03] <z1haze> then idles for 30 minutes
[15:16:07] <z1haze> still a guest, but their data is there
[15:16:14] <robertmaxrees> we time them out and they have to start over./
[15:16:28] <robertmaxrees> iirc.  could have that wrong.
[15:16:39] <robertmaxrees> but that's distinctly different - CC info is exposed.
[15:16:49] <robertmaxrees> before the checkout experience?  meh.
[15:17:18] <taplar> 30 minutes is a pretty long time for a site to remember you if you are not logged in anyway.  especially anything handling financial stuff
[15:17:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:17:34] <taplar> if i walked away for 30 minutes and a site didn't kick me out, i'd be concerned
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> if 30 minutes have passed, the user probably forgot and moved on.
[15:20:05] <cluelessperson> how do you send data in the form of a form array in post data?
[15:20:13] <cluelessperson> having trouble determinig the data structure
[15:20:23] <robertmaxrees> "the form of a form array"?
[15:20:32] <taplar> beat me to it
[15:20:34] <robertmaxrees> you mean as apart of a form?
[15:20:37] <cluelessperson> yes
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> via ajax or...?
[15:20:53] <cluelessperson> yes
[15:21:21] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[15:22:04] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: that's confusing
[15:22:33] <robertmaxrees> what's confusing?
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> you create a new FormData object and populate it.
[15:22:48] <taplar> can you tell us what exactly you are trying to send, and what type (if any) you require the request to be as?
[15:23:59] <cluelessperson> I have  <input id="1" type="number">   I'm using some github "typeWatch" to callback.   I grab the value, and I'd like to submit the value as form data to an api and get a result back.
[15:24:16] <cluelessperson> I'm stuck on properly structuring the form  in the post data
[15:24:23] <cluelessperson> I have several leads
[15:24:34] <robertmaxrees> is the API something you have control over?
[15:24:35] <taplar> how is your endpoint expecting the data?
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:24:53] <cluelessperson> taplar: as form data.
[15:24:59] <taplar> that's not telling me anything
[15:25:04] <taplar> is it a php backend?
[15:25:28] <robertmaxrees> also: your current input wouldn't work correctly anyway.
[15:25:30] <cluelessperson> python backend, incoming = request.form.get('snow')
[15:25:30] <taplar> how is the backend trying to read and use the request input?
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> missing a name attribute
[15:26:03] <taplar> ok, so my assumption would be it's expecting the content type to be the default type, which I think jQuery defaults to the form one
[15:26:06] * taplar goes to the api
[15:26:09] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: I know how to submit a form, this isn't a form.  I'm asking how to use jquery to post the value in a form structure
[15:26:19] <cluelessperson> who cares if the html has a proper form
[15:26:19] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:26:25] <robertmaxrees> alright dudere.
[15:26:28] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[15:26:58] <taplar> ajax defaults to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' which is the same as a normal form submit
[15:26:58] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: don't be annoying
[15:27:07] <taplar> so all you should have to do is just give the post your key value pair
[15:27:25] <cluelessperson> taplar: AH, that's exactly what I needed. Thank you.
[15:27:54] <cluelessperson> sounds like I just need to    serialize( { "name": value } ) and just post that in the data field.
[15:28:09] <taplar> $.post('url', { snow: 'thevalue' })
[15:28:24] <cluelessperson> sweet
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++
[15:30:09] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: I don't mean to be a dick, thanks for helping.
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i'
[15:30:27] <robertmaxrees> *I appreciate that
[15:30:35] <cluelessperson> trying is still helping, don't mean to be difficult.  volunteers don't get enough appreciation.
[15:30:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:30:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm used to it at this point.
[15:31:04] <taplar> Before we can help, we have to understand the problem.  So we have to ask questions, ^_^.
[15:31:15] <robertmaxrees> ^ and we all understand problems differently.
[15:33:23] <robertmaxrees> i wonder when the spam will end.
[15:34:01] <taplar> i think it's just a thing now
[15:34:11] <Samian>  Anyone here use a company wiki at work? My company uses team services and we have a office 365 subscription, so we could host a wiki through those things, but they're both slow. SO I'm looking for alternatives
[15:34:17] <robertmaxrees> it all started from that one channel getting banned.
[15:34:22] <robertmaxrees> Samian i might ask in #web?
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> but also: we use Confluence because #atlassian
[15:49:22] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:17:55] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, RE: if 30 minutes have passed, the user probably forgot and moved on. We thought the same thing, then were were customer service tickets opened for this reason.
[16:18:19] <z1haze> And they take those things crazy seriously here (the customer support tickets)
[16:18:25] <robertmaxrees> we do too.
[16:18:33] <robertmaxrees> and then we look to see what the actual incident rate it.
[16:18:35] <robertmaxrees> *is
[16:18:47] <z1haze> i wish.
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to get that data.  what'
[16:19:07] <z1haze> we work on some of the most wildest edge case tickets all the time
[16:19:13] <robertmaxrees> *what's your backend anyway?
[16:19:18] <z1haze> demandware
[16:19:29] <z1haze> or salesforce commerce cloud, whatever they call it now
[16:19:30] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> that mean's y'all are paying, right?
[16:19:48] <z1haze> its a beast
[16:19:49] <z1haze> yea
[16:19:57] <robertmaxrees> then contact their support.
[16:20:03] <z1haze> ?
[16:20:15] <z1haze> oh you mean as far as why guest sessions expire after 30 minutes?
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> "hey, your policy for guest users is dumb - fix it"
[16:20:31] <robertmaxrees> pass buck.  problem solved.
[16:21:10] <z1haze> haha yeah, perhaps. however they will either do 1. they will say this is just how we do it. 2. we will put in a ticket to get this fixed (but that doesnt mean im off the hook, my boss still wants me to make it work)
[16:21:23] <z1haze> I dont think its passign the buck like I'd hope
[16:21:38] <robertmaxrees> what is your boss actually expecting?
[16:21:57] <z1haze> a seamless flow, the user never knows their session is expired, the add to cart button works as normal
[16:22:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:22:26] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[16:22:33] <z1haze> we basically went through a massive PDP rewrite over the last 4 months
[16:22:44] <z1haze> and we released it a couple weeks ago, so now they are like.. we didnt have this problem before, fixit now
[16:22:54] <z1haze> and in reality the old version was just packed full of hacks and bandaids
[16:23:17] <z1haze> so her thought it, it was fine before, it should be fine now.
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaah.
[16:23:56] <robertmaxrees> that's... rough.
[16:24:04] <z1haze> its  been a fun ride
[16:24:22] <robertmaxrees> boss should take ownership and say "we're not going to subvert the platform like that any more" imo./
[16:26:02] <z1haze> all about the dollars
[16:26:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:26:12] <robertmaxrees> broken rationale.
[16:26:14] <z1haze> the bottom line man
[16:26:15] <z1haze> haha
[16:26:23] <z1haze> maybe, but its business
[16:26:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm serious.
[16:26:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:26:39] <robertmaxrees> if it were business, there'd be some cba on that.
[16:26:55] <z1haze> i think we're like a 60M company, not small potatos but i mean no way IM telling them to make decisions that will lose them money
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> instead it's just "BUT IT USED TO"
[16:27:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:27:21] <robertmaxrees> that's big enough to start making the right decisions.
[16:27:31] <z1haze> you'd think
[16:27:37] <z1haze> but $$$
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> i mean, my company was there once.
[16:27:51] <z1haze> does that mean you're beyond it?
[16:27:55] <z1haze> or just that mentality
[16:27:59] <robertmaxrees> both.
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> now whenever somebody makes some kind of statement of "but muh dollars" we make them prove it.
[16:28:52] <z1haze> haha, maybe when i got about 5 years at least under my belt
[16:29:07] <robertmaxrees> show, unequivocally, that your thing === enough money to sink dev time into it.
[16:29:29] <robertmaxrees> it's a culture shift, no doubt
[16:29:31] <robertmaxrees> but a good one.
[16:31:18] <z1haze> are you the technical architect on your team?
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> we're too big for a single technical architect.
[16:31:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:31:56] <z1haze> ah ok. I wasn't sure the scale of it
[16:33:06] <robertmaxrees> it's complicated, but basically we share resources with our parent comapny's ecom division,.
[16:33:22] <robertmaxrees> they build the platform, we use it and tell them how to make it suck less.
[16:33:40] <z1haze> what is the platform
[16:33:51] <robertmaxrees> in-house stuff.
[16:33:55] <robertmaxrees> all custom built/.
[16:34:07] <z1haze> ah
[16:34:20] <z1haze> we moved from that to demandware about 3 years ago
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[16:35:05] <z1haze> the amount of work to have your own everything, and remain PCI is a nightmare
[16:35:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:35:14] <robertmaxrees> it's actually pretty easy for us.
[16:35:22] <z1haze> well, you essentially are like us
[16:35:24] <z1haze> you dont write the software
[16:35:26] <z1haze> as you put it
[16:35:29] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> not entirely accurate.
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> we still can do PRs against the main platform.
[16:35:40] <robertmaxrees> and do.
[16:35:50] <robertmaxrees> just not my primary job.
[16:35:57] <robertmaxrees> and that's a recent change.
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> we're still running on the last platform we built in-house.  and we've done things that way almost forever.
