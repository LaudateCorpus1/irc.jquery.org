[01:21:49] <ussher_> found some code to do what im after (highlighting the curent dom element) and wrapped it in a function to only turn on when I want but not sure how to say "turn it off when one of the elements is clicked on and send that info somewhere".  This is the selector code: http://jsfiddle.net/3Yw4x/14/
[04:31:51] <acidjazz> are you after it ussher_
[04:31:54] <acidjazz> you gonna get it
[04:31:57] <acidjazz> you get that code
[04:39:06] <ussher_> havent got that sorted yet acidjazz, tried a bit of stuff and think unbind() is what i need.  currently off searching on a different tangent of looking pre-made editors instead of trying to build it myself.
[04:42:02] <ussher_> was trying to build something like a skin design tool, but there are some cool ones around already.  combo of these two would be pretty cool: http://innovastudio.com/builderdemo/example1.html http://www.jqueryrain.com/?FOV4faqo
[07:26:17] <Lope> how can I list/enumerate all of the event handlers attached to an object?
[07:27:29] <Lope> If I use $('#foo').off(); it kills the event handler. But if I use $('#foo').data('events'); I don't get anything.
[09:02:20] <shoky> Lope: $._data(element, 'events')
[09:05:19] <Lope> shocky that's not working for me. Client is running jQuery 1.10.2
[09:06:38] <dcnx> Hi what is the best practice to create a modal ? using <button> or <a> ?
[09:07:01] <drej> dcnx: an anchor that links to the large version of the image
[09:07:08] <drej> so that there's a fallback in the eventuality that js is not running
[09:07:43] <shoky> Lope that works fine with that version.  `element` must be a native DOM element, not a jquery object
[09:08:10] <Lope> oh, okay will try again
[09:08:25] <dcnx> thank you drej
[09:09:14] <drej> np
[09:11:46] <Lope> shoky: yeah it's not working.
[09:12:02] <Lope> I just get undefined.
[09:12:17] <Lope> I've tried both $._data(element, 'events') and jQuery._data(element, 'events')
[09:12:30] <Lope> Is it supposed to work for namespaced events?
[09:18:26] <dcnx> How i can improve my modal ? https://jsfiddle.net/bilbon10/yz64eccy/1/
[09:45:34] <shoky> Lope yea, think so. maybe the event handler was not added by jquery? or maybe it's delegated to another element
[09:48:35] <puneet28> Hi Can anybody help me resolve an issue with https://jsbin.com/faxinilovo/edit?html,output ?
[09:50:17] <Lope> shoky: could be. I checked the form element and the submit button element.
[10:00:45] <shoky> Lope make a jsfiddle/testcase if you need more help with it
[10:03:06] <Lope> shoky: it's okay. I've taken a really hacky alternative approach. I've cloned the whole form. I'm taking input on my fake form, then after I receive and validate the data, I'll copy it to the real form then submit the real form.
[10:03:21] <Lope> so far seems viable.,
[10:03:42] <Lope> and of course I'll set the original form to display:none
[10:04:02] <shoky> hacky indeed
[10:04:15] <shoky> hope there's a reason ;p
[11:15:28] <reliability> hi
[11:16:03] <reliability> Is it possible to have a selectbox which turns into a textfield upon selection of a specific item?
[11:16:48] <reliability> Basically, what I want is for the user to be able to either choose preselected texts or enter a custom text.
[11:32:54] <vitus_> hola
[11:58:29] <salcoder> Hey guys... I'm running an issue when running jquery inside a nodejs *.js... I start with var $ = require ('jquery'); and then try to do something with $.getJSON but I get the following error: TypeError: $.getJSON is not a function.
[11:58:42] <salcoder> I'm using jquery@2.2.2... Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
[12:08:18] <shoky> salcoder: don't use jquery in nodejs.. especially not for http requests. use cheerio for DOM stuff,  and request or bhttp for http requests
[12:09:02] <shoky> leave jquery for running in the browser
[12:09:14] <salcoder> @shoky: I'm not actually doing http requests... I'm doing something in the lines of $.getJSON("data.json"
[12:09:25] <salcoder> I'm trying to get the information of a local file.
[12:09:28] <shoky> salcoder: getJSON is an http request
[12:09:50] <shoky> if you want to get a local file in node you can use the native 'fs' module..
[12:09:51] <salcoder> Hmmm... Some examples show a file...
[12:10:08] <shoky> it's just a url
[12:10:56] <salcoder> shoky: Write the content of data.json to the variable that I want, is that what you are suggesting?
[12:10:58] <shoky> do get a local json in node you can also just use `require`
[12:11:09] <shoky> var data = require('./data.json');    should work i think
[12:11:36] <salcoder> Let me try.
[12:12:10] <shoky> anyways ask stuff in #Node.js if you're working in node
[12:12:32] <salcoder> Yeah, I was confused about getJSON
[12:12:33] <salcoder> :)
[12:12:39] <salcoder> Thanks!
[12:58:16] <hakanaa> Slm
[13:04:20] <MrXXIV__> Is this the most efficient way to select two variables? "$(hsc + ", " + drkn)"
[13:05:14] <shoky> if those are selectors, i'd go with $(hsc).add(drkn)
[13:05:52] <MrXXIV2> Gotcha, that feels better, appreciate it
[13:52:01] <MrXXIV2> Alright, I've created a small bug with the .animate() function. http://pastebin.com/AJLjkzaG
[13:53:01] <MrXXIV2> The menu is currently set 100% to the right, which offsets the menu from the screen. The first animate makes it show, 40% into the screen which I'm guessing is based on the width considering the menu's width is set at 60%, weird math.
[13:53:25] <MrXXIV2> Now when I hide it again at 100%. Trying to reopen the menu, nothing happens, and that's where I'm at a lost.
[13:53:45] <MrXXIV2> You can see the action here http://blog.mylovr.com
[13:53:59] <MrXXIV2> View it in mobile user-agent though
[13:54:14] <jcrawford> hey guys i have the following code which raeches out to API endpoints using JSONP which means the callback functions have to remain in global scope.  However once the list is built I cannot seem to get a click handler to bind to it, any idea how i can make the click handler bind to elements that are generated and injected into the page?  I have tried .bind('click', function()) as well...  http://laravel.io/bin/QNGY1
[14:00:58] <MrXXIV2> Nevermind, the JS actions for the search button has a .hide() function I forgot to remove
[14:34:38] <shoky> jcrawford: you don't have to create the global callback yourself, jquery can do that for you.  $.ajax({url:.., dataType: 'jsonp'}).done(function(response) { ... })
[14:34:55] <jcrawford> yea figured that out tyvm :)

[15:27:03] <fnodeuser> enable TLS 1.2 on code.jquery.com
[15:29:19] <systemfault> Seems to be already done... https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.2.js No?
[15:30:29] <fnodeuser> no
[15:30:33] <fnodeuser> code.jquery.com uses an unsupported protocol. ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
[15:31:11] <fnodeuser> or maybe the error message is misleading and it's because GCM cipher suites are not enabled
[15:31:43] <systemfault> Anyway, https://code.jquery.com/ works for meâ„¢
[15:32:09] <fnodeuser> because your browser didn't specifically request TLS 1.2
[15:33:03] <systemfault> http://imgur.com/EQJlZp5 ?
[15:33:17] <fnodeuser> check the lock on the left of the URL
[15:33:36] <systemfault> It's all green and awesome.
[15:34:00] <fnodeuser> then it seems that EC-only cipher suites are enabled
[15:34:08] <systemfault> http://imgur.com/oKvZmAH
[15:35:13] <fnodeuser> the elliptic curves that are currently in usage are not completely safe
[15:37:41] <fnodeuser> https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ on the bottom there is a table, the ones that are currently used are the NIST ones, from TLS v1.3 forward other elliptic curves will be available also
[15:38:04] <fnodeuser> thank you for checking systemfault
[15:38:09] <systemfault> Glad I could help
[15:38:26] <fnodeuser> hopefully someone from the jquery crew is here and will take care of this
[15:38:35] <fnodeuser> :)
[15:50:10] <z1haze> can someone help me out? im using packery and am using draggable items.. the drag ability works and no errors or feedback in console at all, but i cant get any feedback from the dragItemPositioned event http://packery.metafizzy.co/events.html#dragitempositioned
[15:58:31] <durwasa> how to achieve the following https://jsfiddle.net/durwasa/ysmzpj4c/1/ if I am using JADE as a templating
[15:58:36] <durwasa> help please
[16:01:33] <jhg> hi
[16:02:18] <jhg> quick question, so if i use the javascript.append() function that ive attached to a button click handler, and say i add some new html elements, dont those elements that are added get styled as well?
[16:02:35] <jhg> it appears new html elements i add dynamically arent being styled by the css
[16:04:18] <z1haze> style is css
[16:04:31] <z1haze> so it wouldnt have any effect whether your adding or removing elements
[19:53:09] <jak2000> hi all
[20:18:06] <jak2000> decx are you there?
[20:42:06] <jak2000> how to put on the top this image: http://postimg.org/image/r54wu0x7x/  on this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/885f3ywx/     (not i want add some images...to same canvas), thanks
[21:29:25] <benlieb> what's the easiest way to turn ['this', 'that', 'the other'] into "this, that, and the other" ?
[21:32:03] <benlieb> what's the easiest way to turn ['this', 'that', 'the other'] into "this, that, and the other" ?
[21:46:57] <cuffed_rotator> $('a[href="#objections"]').click(function () ( $('.nav').find('.active').removeClass('active'); });
[21:47:04] <cuffed_rotator> What am I doing wrong here?
[21:47:09] <cuffed_rotator> Doesn't seem to trigger
[21:48:10] <arc_> seems fine. is the element being created after the page loads
[21:48:42] <arc_> also what is the expected behavior
[21:49:25] <cuffed_rotator> I feel stupid now.
[21:49:44] <cuffed_rotator> After document.ready, it works
[21:49:57] <arc_> :)
[21:50:26] <arc_> everybody has made that mistake before
[21:52:03] <cuffed_rotator> Haha, I expect to be making a lot of mistakes in the next few days
[21:52:08] <cuffed_rotator> First time using JS/bootstrap/etc
[21:54:29] <arc_> actually, do you have an open parenthesis after function () instead of an open brace
[21:54:45] <arc_> or was that just a typo in here
[21:55:08] <cuffed_rotator> typo in here
[21:55:10] <arc_> k
[21:55:35] <cuffed_rotator> Thanks for your help :)
[21:55:39] <arc_> np
[21:57:27] <arc_> benlieb is that for a school assignment
[21:57:47] <arc_> seems like one of those problems that nobody really ever has to accomplish in real life :p
[21:58:25] <benlieb> arc_: nope
[21:58:29] <arc_> lol okay
[21:58:36] <benlieb> in RoR: string.to_sentence
[21:58:44] <benlieb> was hoping jQuery was on the level
[21:58:44] <arc_> well i don't necessarily know the easiest way
[21:59:10] <arc_> jquery doesn't have any string manipulation, it's a dom library
[21:59:20] <arc_> i doubt javascript has that function
[21:59:38] <benlieb> not javascript jquery
[21:59:51] <arc_> i understand. like i said, jquery doesn't have any string manipulation
[22:00:15] <arc_> that's not what it's for
[22:00:19] <benlieb> I just i did: last = list.pop; list.join(', ') + ' and ' + last;
[22:01:04] <arc_> that's probably your best bet
[22:01:12] <cuffed_rotator> $(':button[href="#objections"]')
[22:01:15] <cuffed_rotator> doesn't seem to work
[22:01:21] <benlieb> well pop()
[22:01:22] <cuffed_rotator>  <a type="button" data-toggle="tab" href="#objections" class="btn btn-danger" role="button" style="min-width:40;text-align:left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-share"></span>  Go to objections page...</a>
[22:01:23] <benlieb> oops
[22:01:49] <cuffed_rotator> Where am I messing up with the selector?
[22:02:14] <arc_> how about '.btn[href="#objections"]'
[22:03:00] <cuffed_rotator> arc_: that works! :D
[22:03:06] <cuffed_rotator> Why did my selector not work though?
[22:03:22] <arc_> i'm pretty sure :button to select type="button" is not a thing
[22:03:30] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[22:03:45] <arc_> under pseudo-classes selectors you can see all of the things that start with a colon
[22:03:45] <cuffed_rotator> :button	$(":button")	All input elements with type="button"
[22:03:52] <cuffed_rotator> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp
[22:04:25] <arc_> hmm, okay
[22:04:32] <arc_> it's not an input element
[22:04:48] <cuffed_rotator> ah
[22:04:48] <arc_> that literally means <input>
[22:08:09] <cuffed_rotator> arc_: you seem like the man to ask about these things.
[22:08:20] <cuffed_rotator> How would I get a div to float in its place, regardless of scrolling/etc?
[22:10:51] <jak2000> how to put on the top this image: http://postimg.org/image/r54wu0x7x/  on this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/885f3ywx/     (not i want add some images...to same canvas), thanks
[22:11:10] <arc_> cuffed_rotator fixed positioning https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
[22:17:27] <cuffed_rotator> arc_: I tried using position:fixed earlier, but it just pushes the column in front of everything else
[22:17:44] <cuffed_rotator> And I feel like using padding-left is a hacky way to go by it
[22:17:52] <cuffed_rotator> Since the width of the page might change
[22:18:39] <arc_> do you mean on top of everything else?
[22:19:13] <cuffed_rotator> yep
[22:19:50] <arc_> that's what it's supposed to do
[22:20:10] <cuffed_rotator> So pretty much I have 3 columns
[22:20:16] <arc_> you want it to be both relative to the position of other elements and not relative to the position of other elements :p
[22:20:17] <cuffed_rotator> Two to the left that are supposed to be scrollable
[22:20:26] <cuffed_rotator> One on the right that stays in its spot, regardless of scrolling
[22:22:06] <cuffed_rotator> Any idea on how to go by that in a non-hacky, simple way
[22:22:43] <arc_> i'm actually not really the person to ask
[22:22:52] <arc_> i don't know css that well
[22:23:49] <arc_> i pretty much just avoid doing weird stuff like that :p
[22:24:16] <arc_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21868610/make-column-fixed-position-in-bootstrap
[22:24:19] <arc_> maybe this will help you
[22:24:43] <arc_> but i'm guessing your layout is not 100% width
[22:27:13] <cuffed_rotator> Similar, but that's horizontally affixed
[22:27:27] <cuffed_rotator> And bootstrap's affix would seem like a great option, but it doesn't work as expected
[22:31:21] <cuffed_rotator> Hm
[22:31:26] <cuffed_rotator> Managed to get affix working
[22:31:29] <cuffed_rotator> Weird bug though
[23:12:30] <blackrose13> hello anyone alive?
