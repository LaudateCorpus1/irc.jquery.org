[00:32:10] <somehelp_> http://jsfiddle.net/2bke6rcn/ - how come the else doesn't work? I'm trying to add a "open" class on the clicked item, and "hide" class on all other items. It's javascript, i would ask in js channel if i was allowed :\
[07:46:43] <mad_moses> hi, how can I get the value of the attribute "aria-controls"
[09:55:02] <amlm> hi. can i ask for a little help? ty
[10:01:47] <pavonia> That's the purpose of this channel
[10:25:41] <traptrip> is it possible to load jquery asynchronously, then wait for it to fire an onload event, and use $ in the onload handler and after as I normally would?
[10:26:43] <traptrip> I would load it by inserting a dynamically generated script element using insertBefore
[10:27:55] <pavonia> You could add a timeout that polls until the jQuery object is undefined
[10:28:00] <pavonia> Err defined*
[10:29:40] <traptrip> pavonia, then I gather jquery doesn't fire some event when it's ready?
[10:30:06] <traptrip> I've seen the approach using a timeout before, but ideally I would like to use something a little more elegant
[10:30:20] <pavonia> I'm not aware of such an event
[10:33:43] <traptrip> it's a little strange how it's such a powerful tool to use for all sorts of events, but lacks a simple 'init done' event itself :)
[10:34:02] <traptrip> I suppose I have no choice but to poll on a timer :/
[10:54:36] <how2hack> i need some help to figure something out, i'm not sure what's wrong but it's like code outside a ajax .done() is executed before the .done() is finished
[10:54:45] <how2hack> how can i fix that?
[10:56:30] <how2hack> no wait, i explained it wrong, the last piece of code (an if) inside a .done() is not getting executed
[10:56:48] <shoky> how2hack: probably the if condition is false, for some reason
[10:57:03] <how2hack> i tried reproducing it in a jsfiddle but for some reason i can't
[10:57:22] <shoky> how2hack: i looked at your code yesterday.. it's too long to just read through without being able to test it ourselves. you need a small testcase
[10:57:37] <how2hack> the if condition must be true because the other times it is, i mean when i refresh the page sometimes the if is not getting executed
[10:57:47] <shoky> just because it is the other times,
[10:57:51] <shoky> doesn't mean it is now :)
[10:58:49] <how2hack> hmm but how can that be, the if condition is if element has class, and the thing isthat class is set from php, the only one that can change that class is the user when clicking on other menu option
[10:59:08] <shoky> i have no idea, as i can't see it for myself.
[10:59:10] <how2hack> so the if must be always true
[10:59:15] <shoky> so you say.
[10:59:19] <how2hack> did you see the video i uploaded yesterday?
[10:59:26] <shoky> it was not helpful :)
[10:59:30] <how2hack> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af_7OQT7PCU&t=1s
[10:59:33] <shoky> only a testcase would be helpful
[10:59:48] <how2hack> ok i'll try again
[11:00:02] <how2hack> but shouldn't the if be always true when refreshing?
[11:00:24] <shoky> how should i know?
[11:02:11] <how2hack> giving the case i just gave you, the if is if the default menu option has class current, this class is set in php, so when refreshing the option always has that class until i click another menu option
[11:02:28] <shoky> also i think your video had a lot of console.logs that weren't in the code you shared, so it was just confusing
[11:03:02] <how2hack> and the only thing i do is keep pressing f5 so i never change anything, a few times only the if is not true? how can that be?
[11:03:17] <how2hack> yes, i put those console.log to see what happens
[11:03:26] <how2hack> and what happens is the if is not getting executed
[11:03:30] <how2hack> doesn't make any sense
[11:03:33] <shoky> if it is always set in the html and nothing else touches it, then yes . though - when refreshing, browsers can sometimes leave some stuff as they were before
[11:03:42] <shoky> i've noticed firefox do it a lot
[11:03:54] <how2hack> it happens too with chrome
[11:03:56] <shoky> where it's not a full refresh
[11:04:20] <shoky> but anyways.  did you try a console.log right before the if/
[11:04:20] <how2hack> but leaving stuff as before, before it had the class, the if was true so why not after refreshing?
[11:04:30] <shoky> log right before the if, right after it,  etc
[11:04:36] <shoky> shouldn't be too hard to debug
[11:04:42] <how2hack> not yet, testing right away
[11:05:01] <shoky> again, no idea without seeing it myself
[11:05:32] <shoky> and it might be something else (not the if condition) entirely, who knows
[11:08:14] <how2hack> i did upload the app to a test domain, wanna check it for yourself?
[11:08:31] <shoky> sure.. does it happen there too?
[11:08:37] <how2hack> yes
[11:08:39] <shoky> k
[11:09:13] <how2hack> http://auth.cryptor3.com/?demo
[11:11:47] <how2hack> it skips the if, but you can see in the inspector that li.fa.fa-chart-line has class current, so i don't know why it skips it
[11:13:59] <shoky> how2hack: well
[11:14:15] <shoky> you are doing:  GetMenu()      GetContent(true)
[11:14:32] <shoky> both of them do ajax requests
[11:14:40] <shoky> you didn't do anything to make sure one happens before the other
[11:14:55] <shoky> so, if GetMenu()  takes longer some times,
[11:15:07] <shoky> then the menu with  li.fa.fa-chart-line  is not even loaded yet
[11:15:12] <shoky> so of course, the  if()  is false
[11:15:16] <how2hack> oh
[11:15:40] <how2hack> so i should move GetContent(true) inside GetMenu()
[11:15:59] <shoky> brb
[11:43:46] <shoky> how2hack: yea that'd work.  you should probably learn promises to make it nicer to do these async requests.  (jquery's ajax methods return promises)
[11:44:20] <how2hack> you mean like using when()?
[11:44:37] <shoky> it'd let you do stuff like:   GetMenu().then(() => GetContent(true))
[11:44:55] <how2hack> yea i like that
[11:44:55] <shoky> yeah when() too, if you need to wait for multiple promises
[11:46:00] <how2hack> hmm i'd need to change the server logic, return all content in a single request
[11:46:04] <how2hack> right?
[11:46:16] <shoky> nope, no change needed on server
[11:46:30] <how2hack> you mind giving me an example?
[11:54:05] <shoky> how2hack:  https://www.hastebin.com/ehezafegak.js    $.map  is like $.each but it returns a mapped array of what you return inside for each item. so `promises` is an array of the $.get() return values, which are promises
[11:54:26] <shoky> and $.when.apply($, promises)  is the way to pass an array to $.when
[11:54:52] <shoky> i guess you could also use Promise.all(promises).then(...)  with jquery 3
[11:56:11] <how2hack> i'm using jquery 3, the latest stable
[12:07:45] <how2hack> if i don't need to return anything i can remove return data; and then((datas) to then(() => GetContent())?
[12:08:24] <shoky> yes
[12:08:48] <shoky> the return data;  actually wouldn't work unlessyou change .done() to .then()  i think
[12:10:04] <how2hack> do i need to also change GetContent() to use promises?
[12:11:38] <shoky> only if you had more steps to do after it.  and btw, it's already using promises ( all ajax methods return promises ),  just it's not returning a promise
[12:12:26] <how2hack> oh right, thanks for the help
[12:12:57] <shoky> np
[12:20:05] <joao_> helo. how can i change the position of buttons? they are always in the bottom of page
[12:45:28] <how2hack> shoky: when you visited the page, how bad were the load times? acceptable? not just the server, but the code efficiency was it good?
[12:49:45] <shoky> how2hack: load times ok, not too bad. code efficiency... donno i only looked at one specific part
[13:00:04] <how2hack> ok that'll do it until production
[15:43:42] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[17:01:21] <damarusama> I am using handlebars and would like to apply a jquery UI once the handlerbars template is loaded
[17:02:40] <damarusama> but it's giving weird results. I'm working with the accordion UI
[17:03:11] <damarusama> when I add the <div id="accordion"> in the handlebars templates it really mess up the layout.
[17:04:28] <damarusama> I know it's kind of a shot in the dark at this point, but just wodnered if anyone ran into that
[17:07:22] <robertmaxrees> "it really mess up the layout" meaning...?
[17:07:52] <robertmaxrees> you've basically said "Help, it's broken, what do I do?!" without explaining how it's broken :)
[17:08:21] <damarusama> well in short it make one big accordion layer with all the template generated from handlebar
[17:08:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:09:06] <robertmaxrees> can you show me??
[17:11:28] <damarusama> let me upload a dev example
[17:11:50] <damarusama> http://slavadancefusion.com/dev/#sectionClasses
[17:11:57] <damarusama> that's one of the output
[17:12:08] <robertmaxrees> well
[17:12:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix your js firstr.
[17:12:51] <robertmaxrees> it also looks like your markup might not be valid.
[17:13:04] <robertmaxrees> it's, like, half working.
[17:13:16] <damarusama> well let me remove the accordion
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> oh wait.
[17:13:25] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap?
[17:13:32] <damarusama> ohhh
[17:13:36] <damarusama> eys
[17:13:37] <damarusama> yes
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> use the bootstrap accordion instead
[17:13:50] <damarusama> if you refresh you have the content
[17:13:54] <damarusama> right... let me check
[17:34:28] <robertmaxrees> doot doot doot
