[18:00:11] <crs> Hi there
[18:00:52] <crs> I need to generate some complex html over and over in the loop, looking for some templating system, is there something built in, or do I need to find an external project?
[18:08:43] <crs> Ah, have found jsrender.
[20:33:38] <thykka> crs, this is nice https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[20:38:07] <crs> thykka: No logic? I have heavy logic in my template. :
[20:50:06] <thykka> logic should stay in js, imho. Handlebars has more logic if you really want that https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars
[21:24:50] <crs> thykka: Hmm, I see your point, it is just that based on logic I add classes and stuffâ€¦ Will think about it.
[21:24:53] <crs> Thanks!
