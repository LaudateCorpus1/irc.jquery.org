[00:27:50] <tirengarfio> I have this site: www.ovra.es, if you press this "Scroll to section 3", you will go to the section 3 smoothly. The problem: it doesn't work on iphone5.. any help?
[00:28:57] <tirengarfio> I just copied/pasted the code from here: http://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/
[00:29:09] <tirengarfio> that code works perfect on iphone 5
[00:44:42] <the8thbit> I want to do something like this:
[00:44:43] <the8thbit> 	var inputFieldWrapperHTML = inputFieldWrapper.html();
[00:44:48] <the8thbit> 	inputFieldWrapper.html( inputFieldWrapperHTML );
[00:44:53] <the8thbit> and then reference an element within inputFieldWrapper
[00:45:00] <the8thbit> How do I go about doing that? (when I try just doing it normally, $( '#inputField' ), the selector doesn't work)
[00:46:26] <Cork> the8thbit: why are you serializing the elements to html?
[00:47:25] <Cork> the8thbit: also you can't have multiple elements with the same id
[00:48:40] <the8thbit> Cork: I only have one element with that ID. Also, what do you mean by serializing?
[00:49:09] <Cork> the8thbit: .html() will take the content of inputFieldWrapper and convert it from dom to html
[00:49:53] <the8thbit> Ah, so that's whats screwing it up?
[00:50:08] <Colmea> Hey. I have some trouble to select a select element by his (array) name: I think my selector is good, but my val is undefined: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/71ccbe76ef357acf2129
[00:51:20] <Cork> the8thbit: well you need to solve a problem you wouldn't have it you used .clone() instead
[00:51:45] <Cork> the8thbit: though var inputFieldWrapperHTML = $(inputFieldWrapper.html()); could solve it too
[00:51:57] <Cork> though.. silly (dom > html > parse to dom again)
[00:52:06] <the8thbit> Cork: I didn't know about that method. Thanks :)
[00:52:25] <the8thbit> Cork: Yeah, it is silly, though it was only my test case
[00:53:45] <the8thbit> Cork: so like this?:
[00:53:52] <the8thbit> 	var inputFieldWrapperHTML = inputFieldWrapper.clone();
[00:53:52] <the8thbit> 	inputFieldWrapper.html( inputFieldWrapperHTML );
[00:54:06] <Cork> except the variable name most likely is a bit silly
[00:54:16] <Cork> and you will add the wrapper into the wrapper
[00:54:25] <the8thbit> or just   inputFieldWrapper = inputFieldWrapperHTML
[00:54:38] <the8thbit> its wrappers all the way down
[00:54:43] <Cork> inputFieldWrapper.clone() clones the wrapper while inputFieldWrapper.html() grabs the content of it
[00:54:52] <the8thbit> right
[00:55:23] <Cork> also why are you adding it back to the same element?
[00:55:26] <Cork> seams kinda silly
[00:55:40] <Cork> or are you trying to add more fields?
[00:56:08] <the8thbit> Cork: At a certain point in my program, I load something else into inputFieldWrapper, and I need to restore it to its original state
[00:56:23] <Cork> ah
[00:56:32] <the8thbit> those two lines was just a test case which, on their own, do look rather silly
[00:56:39] <Cork> i would add a container inside the wrapper
[00:56:42] <Cork> and just store it
[00:56:59] <Cork> the8thbit: if you want to hold on to the old element you don't need .clone()
[00:57:13] <Cork> it has other upsides too
[00:57:25] <Cork> as it actually will keep what the user typed in it
[00:58:02] <the8thbit> Cork: I'd probably be clearing that anyway, but that's nice to know
[00:59:02] <the8thbit> ha okay, so new problem
[00:59:14] <the8thbit> .clone fixes the issue with textField
[00:59:22] <the8thbit> but now I have the same issue with textFieldWrapper
[01:00:15] <Cork> the8thbit: like i said, i would just store a reference to a section with the fields in them
[01:00:20] <TTomiK> hey... how can I dealy jqueryUI/spinner ajax request ?
[01:00:22] <Cork> and then have the new content replace that section
[01:00:36] <Cork> the8thbit: then when you want to restore it you just add that section back
[01:00:58] <TTomiK> I mean if someone clicks the spinner up/down -buttons repeatedly, I don't want the request to be sent after each click, but only after... say 500ms after stopping
[01:01:22] <the8thbit> Cork: Does that mean var inputFieldWrapperHTML = $(inputFieldWrapper.html());
[01:01:32] <the8thbit> Or are you talking about a third solution?
[01:01:32] <Cork> no
[01:03:02] <Cork> <div id="fields"><div id="sections"> <!-- content --></div></div> var backup = $('#sections'); $('#fields').html(backup);
[01:03:06] <Cork> the8thbit: ^
[01:04:18] <the8thbit> TTomiK: Its been a little while, but I believe you can use jquery to create timers. Just create a timer when the user sends a request, and then check to see what value the timer is at when the user tries to send another request?
[01:04:56] <the8thbit> Cork: thanks
[01:05:07] <TTomiK> the8thbit: doesn't that cause multiple unnecessary requests ?
[01:05:11] <Cork> TTomiK: the solution for that is to use setTimeout when the input change happens
[01:05:23] <Cork> ex set it to 500 ms
[01:05:38] <Cork> on each input run clearTimer on the old timer
[01:05:52] <Cork> so if you don't push the button for 500 ms the call happens
[01:05:57] <TTomiK> Cork: ok, I'll check the clearTimer
[01:06:01] <the8thbit> ah, thats the function I was thinking of, setTimeout
[01:06:13] <Cork> the8thbit: that isn't jquery through
[01:06:20] <Cork> it native js
[01:06:26] <the8thbit> Cork: Yep, I realize that now after searching it
[01:06:52] <the8thbit> I often forget whats jq and whats js
[01:07:04] <TTomiK> Cork: are you talking about cleartimeout ?
[01:07:17] <Cork> TTomiK: ugg ya
[01:07:24] <the8thbit> yes
[01:07:26] <Cork> setTimeout => clearTimeout
[01:07:45] <TTomiK> Cork: ok, I'll check that out :) Thanks
[01:07:52] <Cork> TTomiK: store the return value from setTimeout and give that to clearTimeout
[01:07:58] <Cork> ?mdn setTimeout
[01:08:00] <b-ot> Cork: window.setTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout
[01:08:01] <Cork> ?mdn clearTimeout
[01:08:05] <b-ot> Cork: Window.clearTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.clearTimeout
[01:08:39] <the8thbit> TTomiK: Its worth noting that this is a clientside solution, so if your user modifies or creates a new client, they could bypass this restriction
[01:09:08] <Cork> the8thbit: well you don't want to limit it per user, just per page
[01:09:30] <TTomiK> the8thbit: I'm using it for product's amount change in basket
[01:09:31] <Cork> and flow control should happen server side, but server side will throw an error if you exceed it
[01:09:46] <Cork> so js is to hide the protection
[01:10:15] <the8thbit> Cork: right
[01:10:58] <Cork> uhh... pizza that stays fresh for three years...
[01:11:10] <Cork> that does not sound healthy...
[01:12:13] <the8thbit> The day I read about the pizza that stays fresh for three years, I wept, for I realized that Man would eventually cure all ailments and live forever, but that I would not be among them, as I will eat the pizza.
[01:12:17] <mehrdad> hello everyone
[01:12:35] <Cork> lol
[01:13:08] <mehrdad> i have a little bit of jquery code that animates the height of an element from 20px to 100%, but the animation is not smooth for going to full height, should i specify a pixel height rather than percent ?
[01:13:17] <mehrdad> or is something else not correct ?
[01:13:45] <Cork> mehrdad: is it jerky or does it jump?
[01:13:50] <mehrdad> it kinda jumps from 20px
[01:14:24] <Cork> well % height has the problem of not really being supported by how html flows
[01:14:45] <Cork> so ya, you should prob grab what 100% will be and use that
[01:14:53] <Cork> and when the animation ends set it to % again
[01:15:27] <mehrdad> well i just need it to be height of its content
[01:15:45] <Cork> hmm
[01:15:50] <Cork> height: auto should work
[01:16:06] <Cork> animate({ height: 'auto' })
[01:16:26] <Cork> mehrdad: also make sure the element has overflow: hidden
[01:16:30] <mehrdad> i tried that , but it didn't work, i'm gonna try it again
[01:16:30] <Cork> else this won't work
[01:16:31] <Tekla> meah... can't even get my problem explanation working :( jsfiddle.net/S7H97/
[01:16:31] <mehrdad> it has
[01:19:29] <Tekla> why doesn't my datepicker work on jsfiddle?
[01:19:35] <Cork> Tekla: http://jsfiddle.net/S7H97/1/
[01:19:54] <Tekla> thx
[01:24:51] <the8thbit> Cork: So that worked! I don't love how clunky that makes my html (with having to have a wrapper and a wrapper wrapper) but its way better than nothing
[01:24:52] <the8thbit> thans
[01:24:55] <the8thbit> *thanks
[01:25:20] <anli_> I want some breakpoint to occur if someone tries to set a certain css value of a certain table, is that possible?
[01:25:40] <anli_> Maybe I can just override the css function
[01:25:53] <anli_> But that a bit clumsy
[01:26:42] <Cork> anli_: ya, that will be a bit hard to do
[01:26:46] <mehrdad> if ($(item).css("height") != "auto") {
[01:26:46] <mehrdad>         $(".teamItem").animate({ height: "20px" }, 500, function () {
[01:26:46] <mehrdad>             $(item).animate({ height: "auto" }, 500);
[01:26:46] <mehrdad>         });
[01:26:46] <mehrdad>     }
[01:26:49] <mehrdad> sorry
[01:27:05] <mehrdad> thought it's not too long to require a paste
[01:27:14] <Cork> it is
[01:27:15] <anli_> Cork: Still, I want to know which part of the code that forces a certain height of a table
[01:27:21] <Cork> anli_: especially as .css can take several different formats
[01:27:30] <anli_> yes
[01:27:51] <Cork> also... you really should use classes instead of inline values
[01:28:05] <Cork> that makes managing this kind of stuff MUCH simpler
[01:28:08] <anli_> Maybe I can just be fine with the face that if I cannot see it directly in the code which part that forces the table height, the code just needs some refactoring
[01:28:13] <anli_> face=>fact
[01:28:45] <Cork> anli_: well .css() should be factored out
[01:28:47] <anli_> Well, some times, a height needs to be set in runtime
[01:28:53] <Cork> and replaced with .addClass instead
[01:29:07] <mehrdad> just how did you manage to type face instead of fact ?
[01:29:11] <mehrdad> :D
[01:29:14] <Cork> anli_: ya, but those usually don't use .cs()
[01:29:16] <Cork> *css()
[01:29:24] <anli_> ok?
[01:29:25] <Cork> anli_: those use .height() most of the time
[01:29:31] <anli_> hm, well, true
[01:29:43] <anli_> Unless you want to involve calc
[01:30:00] <anli_> But thats ugly in many ways to do in runtime
[01:30:13] <Cork> anli_: setting height through .height() doesn't trigger a reflow
[01:30:23] <Cork> reading from it does though
[01:30:32] <anli_> reflow you say, whats that?
[01:30:45] <Cork> anli_: i think that is what you mean by calc
[01:30:49] <anli_> ah
[01:30:56] <Cork> if not, then i don̈́'t know what calc is
[01:31:05] <anli_> style="height:calc(100%-2px)" is what I mean
[01:31:07] <mehrdad> Cork the if statement is not working there
[01:31:10] <Cork> ah
[01:31:18] <mehrdad> it never sets the height to auto
[01:31:22] <Cork> anli_: well if you can use calc it is the better choice
[01:31:28] <Cork> though the support isn't really there yet
[01:31:51] <Cork> mehrdad: please create a jsfiddle
[01:32:01] <anli_> I think it is sufficient and if you have border width on a table that should take up 100% of its parent, you have no alternative, right?
[01:32:38] <mehrdad> alright
[01:32:38] <Cork> anli_: 100% of it's parent?
[01:32:48] <anli_> Well, height:100%, you know
[01:32:57] <anli_> Or width
[01:32:59] <Cork> ok, what's the problem with 100%?
[01:33:06] <anli_> The problem is that borders add to the width
[01:33:12] <anli_> At least what I experienced
[01:33:13] <Cork> ya?
[01:33:20] <anli_> And borders want to go inside instead
[01:33:31] <anli_> Unless you want it to look bad
[01:33:32] <anli_> lol
[01:33:54] <Cork> well if you want the browser to calculate the elements width including border (contra to normal)
[01:33:56] <anli_> I were sitting for a while not understanding why my table got too wide
[01:33:58] <Cork> just tell it to
[01:34:04] <Cork> there is a css pref for it
[01:34:08] <anli_> oh
[01:34:19] <anli_> box-sizing?
[01:34:22] <Cork> ?mdn box-sizing
[01:34:23] <Cork> ya
[01:34:24] <b-ot> Cork: box-sizing - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing
[01:34:27] <anli_> ah
[01:34:45] <anli_> Should use that instead then, but I assume the support is not 100% there either
[01:35:43] <Cork> anli_: i suspect you use tables for layout
[01:35:46] <Cork> kinda sounds like it
[01:35:53] <Cork> and tables isn't meant for that
[01:36:06] <Cork> so you will have a ton of different problems from that
[01:36:06] <anli_> Oh, this was for a calendar
[01:36:21] <Cork> then ya
[01:36:23] <mehrdad> i use a table for calendar too
[01:36:26] <Cork> should't be a table
[01:36:28] <mehrdad> it's fine
[01:36:36] <Cork> not really
[01:36:42] <anli_> Of course it should, the days in the month view arrange very much tabular
[01:36:42] <mehrdad> why not?
[01:36:47] <Cork> it isn't a table list of content
[01:36:53] <Cork> the table would be for layout
[01:36:59] <mehrdad> it's strucutre of table
[01:37:00] <Cork> meaning shouldn't be a table
[01:37:20] <anli_> I dont understand people being anal about the choice of <table>, no offence or sexual implications involved
[01:37:31] <mehrdad> again, why not?
[01:37:32] <Cork> mehrdad: tables isn't for "creating sectons of data"
[01:37:38] <mehrdad> it's responsive too
[01:37:42] <Cork> it is for creating tables, as in a list with columns
[01:38:08] <Cork> if you arn't listing data; you should not use <table>
[01:38:11] <anli_> <table> is still a number one solution if you want to be sure two elements are side by side :)
[01:38:11] <mehrdad> hmm, that's not explaining the problems it will cause
[01:38:31] <Cork> anli_: no
[01:38:31] <mehrdad> well i don't use table anywhere else for layout
[01:38:34] <Cork> not true at all
[01:38:43] <anli_> Floats or no good
[01:38:55] <Cork> it is the constantly abused 90's hack solution
[01:38:57] <anli_> They cause of lot of head ache
[01:39:03] <Cork> anli_: there is display:
[01:39:08] <Cork> and a lot of other solutions
[01:39:11] <mehrdad> i'm not noticing any problems with the calendar table
[01:39:12] <Cork> and flex is comming
[01:39:27] <Cork> mehrdad: it is semantically wrong
[01:39:41] <anli_> yeah, but <table> is the only element giving me the sense of "well, they cant be other than side by side, no matter which direction the wind will blow in"
[01:39:49] <Cork> just as wrong as using table to create sidebars
[01:39:56] <mehrdad> well i would say it's correct semantically
[01:40:02] <anli_> "wrong" is used correctly here?
[01:40:15] <mehrdad> the representation of a calendar /is/ a table
[01:40:22] <anli_> true
[01:40:23] <Cork> mehrdad: no it is a grid
[01:40:31] <anli_> But there is no <grid> tag
[01:40:32] <anli_> lol
[01:40:36] <mehrdad> a grid is a table
[01:40:37] <Cork> well ya
[01:40:49] <Cork> so you create a grid from other elements
[01:40:49] <mehrdad> same semantics
[01:40:56] <Cork> mehrdad: no it isn't
[01:40:58] <anli_> <table> is an honest solution to many of my problems
[01:41:05] <mehrdad> again, for upper layer layout and page layout i'm using div
[01:41:09] <mehrdad> it makes sense there
[01:41:20] <mehrdad> and creates a flowing layout
[01:41:47] <Cork> but ya, right now you will have to go a bit extra to do it correctly
[01:42:02] <Cork> flex will make this a hole lot better though
[01:42:31] <anli_> Would you fight the use of <grid> if that tag existed as well?
[01:42:44] <Cork> kinda
[01:42:51] <Cork> not if it existed
[01:42:55] <Cork> but i doubt it will
[01:43:15] <anli_> If it will of not is not part of the question :)
[01:43:21] <Cork> there is new standards specifically created to solve this
[01:43:29] <Cork> and it is for css, not html to style things
[01:43:39] <Cork> html is meant to hold the semantic of the data, not they design
[01:43:43] <mehrdad> to be honest, you are right in a way, since i am using div for other grid based layouts
[01:43:50] <mehrdad> but somehow i opted to use table for calendar
[01:43:55] <mehrdad> no issues so far though
[01:44:10] <anli_> but you never want to style a month view to something else than a grid
[01:44:25] <Cork> mehrdad: and i can say this; for all the abuses of table, calenders is one of the most ok ones
[01:44:34] <mehrdad> well table is the frst obvious choice there
[01:44:41] <Cork> anli_: you might
[01:45:01] <Cork> ex if you have several appointments and are to show it on a small mobile screen
[01:45:01] <anli_> Its not  a style matter actually
[01:45:07] <Cork> then a list might be MUCH more reasonable
[01:45:11] <anli_> But a function matter
[01:45:20] <Cork> it is style
[01:45:25] <anli_> Its not an agenda its a month view
[01:45:28] <Cork> html should care about date and content
[01:45:41] <Cork> css is how it should be layout and styled
[01:46:39] <mehrdad> for data you say? MS still uses font tag etc for the style of its support feedback page, but i think it's a legacy thing
[01:47:20] <Cork> mehrdad: are you saying ms is the goto source for how you should follow specs? :D
[01:47:25] <mehrdad> lol
[01:47:28] <Cork> msxml anymore?
[01:47:30] <Cork> *anyone
[01:47:44] <Cork> "lets move the attributes to the closing tag"
[01:47:51] <anli_> hehe
[01:48:26] <mehrdad> well i'd just say that in the case of table there are no hard and fast rules , especially in a layout such as the calendar's
[01:48:41] <Cork> mehrdad: there is actually
[01:48:52] <Cork> it's just that most of the web ignores it
[01:48:57] <mehrdad> nothing's preventing me from that
[01:49:01] <mehrdad> no issues
[01:49:02] <Cork> sure
[01:49:24] <Tekla> Cork: jsfiddle.net/S7H97/3/
[01:49:30] <Cork> nothing prevents you from adding everything in the page in <b> tags and style it to what ever you like with classes either
[01:49:41] <mehrdad> i see where you are coming from
[01:49:45] <mehrdad> anyhow
[01:49:45] <Cork> it doens't make it semantically correct
[01:49:54] <Tekla> if i click on the button i want the field date format to update automatically
[01:49:55] <mehrdad> i'm still struggling with the animation :p
[01:49:58] <Tekla> how do i do that?
[01:50:08] <mehrdad> all this time i could have prepared a jsfiddle
[01:50:33] <Cork> Tekla: i don't know that much about datepicker
[01:50:38] <Cork> especially translating it
[01:51:04] <Tekla> well... i think the problem is that i need it to refresh the instance
[01:51:09] <Tekla> trigger it somehow
[01:51:23] <Cork> try reading the api docs
[01:51:26] <Tekla> if you click foo and select a date it'll be kinda new
[01:51:47] <Cork> if it isn't in there the only way i could help you would be to read the datepicker source code
[01:52:11] <Tekla> i'll get back to you on that ;)
[01:52:30] <Cork> and no that wasn't an offer to read it for you
[01:52:51] <Cork> it was just a statement on what i would have to do; (so you could do it if that would be needed)
[01:54:54] <mehrdad> Cork are you british? i'm asking because my language isn't english and i want to learn the difference between dialects from real people
[01:54:54] <anli_> Is there a way to halt scripts on a page and then try to set a measure in firebug?
[01:55:04] <anli_> I just want to know that no script can tamper with the value
[01:55:19] <Cork> mehrdad: nope
[01:55:27] <Cork> mehrdad: to the north :)
[01:55:27] <mehrdad> American ?
[01:55:33] <Cork> swedish
[01:55:34] <mehrdad> oh norway?
[01:55:36] <mehrdad> oh right
[01:55:38] <Cork> XD
[01:55:47] <Cork> close but no cigar :)
[01:56:18] <Cork> anli_: set a measure?
[01:56:22] <mehrdad> big hulky scandinavian guy right ? :p
[01:56:29] <mehrdad> muscular
[01:56:33] <anli_> Yes, set the height of a table
[01:56:47] <Cork> mehrdad: i'm a computer nerd... no
[01:56:53] <mehrdad> :D
[01:57:11] <Cork> long ya, hulky.. not so much
[01:57:54] <mehrdad> i'd suppose a computer nerd from scandinavia is still more muscular than a nerd from middle east :p
[01:58:10] <mehrdad> typically of course
[01:58:11] <Cork> heh...
[01:58:29] <mehrdad> bossis here
[01:58:36] <mehrdad> bye!
[01:58:41] <Uhkis> dem stereotypes
[01:58:56] <Uhkis> even tho i'm not from scandinavia
[01:58:59] <anli_> I alter the height using the layout tab in firefox, I alter the measure of the table from 911x485 to 911x474 and the second later, its changed back
[01:59:12] <anli_> So I assume it is a script that alters the height periodically
[01:59:38] <Cork> anli_: ya sounds like it
[01:59:49] <Cork> anli_: search for setInterval in the code
[02:05:31] <Snoopal> hey guys how can i replace a part of a string within an object? foo_bar.replace does not work
[02:11:36] <the8thbit> I want to make it impossible for the user to interact with an element (by e.g., hovering over it) What's the best way to do this?
[02:13:12] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to clear a settimeout ?
[02:13:36] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: clearTimeout?
[02:13:43] <TheJHNZ> that exists?
[02:13:54] <TheJHNZ> well then!
[02:14:13] <Snoopal> yep :)
[02:14:25] <TheJHNZ> there's no docs on it
[02:14:28] <the8thbit> yes sir
[02:14:29] <the8thbit> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.clearTimeout
[02:14:38] <TheJHNZ> oh no jquery function ?
[02:14:49] <Snoopal> not necessary cause it is js native
[02:14:55] <TheJHNZ> alright :-)
[02:15:03] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: Its js not jquery, I made the same mistake earlier :)
[02:15:04] <Snoopal> like setTimeout ;)
[02:15:17] <TheJHNZ> so i'd set the settimeout as a variable and then cleartimeout that variable ?
[02:15:36] <Snoopal> exactly
[02:16:06] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: window.clearTimeout( yourTimingVariable );
[02:16:25] <anli_> I invented a super cool way of debugging a webpage, saving the html by right clicking the html node in firebug and "copy html", then I can paste that in a text editor and remove the scripts
[02:16:28] <TheJHNZ> ahh and to run a settimeout variable would i just do an if ?
[02:16:33] <TheJHNZ> or is there any easier way
[02:16:58] <anli_> So now I know that there is no script that gives me the wrong table height
[02:17:57] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: what do you mean?
[02:19:02] <TheJHNZ> like call the setTimeout once it's a variable
[02:19:04] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: setTimeout() takes a javascript function and a time in ms. After the ms have passed, the function is executed
[02:19:23] <TheJHNZ> var progressTime = setTimeout(function() {$('#uploading-bar').slideUp()} , 3000);
[02:19:30] <TheJHNZ> so that will exectue automatically ?
[02:20:05] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: I believe so, though I haven't used setTimeout in a while
[02:20:49] <the8thbit> TheJHNZ: Theres more info here: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
[02:21:08] <TheJHNZ> got it :-)
[02:21:14] <TheJHNZ> eww w3schools
[02:24:48] <Cork> ?g w3cfools
[02:24:50] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention → http://www.w3fools.com/
[02:24:51] <Cork> the8thbit: ^
[02:25:04] <Cork> please don't point ppl to w3schools
[02:27:50] <the8thbit> Cork: Yikes, I knew they weren't affiliated with the W3C, but not that they're known to be inaccurate
[02:28:15] <Cork> the8thbit: they are bad in quite a long list of reasons
[02:28:36] <Cork> the8thbit: to the point that you can identify users that use them by the question types they ask
[02:30:19] <the8thbit> Cork: I'm curious as to some examples? I've used them frequently because they show up on the top of google searches often, and now I'm frightened
[02:31:11] <Cork> gtg a little while
[02:32:46] <Snoopal> i added a new list item to ul via "append" how can i now make it "readable" for jquery?
[02:36:46] <Snoopal> i set a "click" event for all li elements but it does not trigger for the new added element
[02:37:28] <plepzz> You should use the "on" event instead.
[02:38:31] <Snoopal> same result
[02:40:04] <plepzz> Can I see the code for it?
[02:40:14] <Snoopal> yes one moment.
[02:40:53] <Snoopal> http://pastebin.com/0z9p9VqM
[02:41:00] <Snoopal> click event is on line 54
[02:41:25] <Snoopal> the added part is above on line 34
[02:42:23] <plepzz> Try changing line 54 to: jQuery('.form-content').on('click', 'li', function() {
[02:43:09] <Snoopal> ha! this works! thank you very much!
[02:43:44] <plepzz> You're welcome! :)
[02:45:55] <aaron1245> Can anyone help me with a deferred/promise problem?
[02:46:09] <Cork> ?ask
[02:46:09] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:47:56] <aaron1245> I'm using jQuery and deferred's in phonegap/cordova and I need to figure out how to run a function once a series of downloads are complete.  Fiddle here :
[02:47:57] <aaron1245> http://jsfiddle.net/U6wgU/
[02:54:05] <Cork> aaron1245: have you used deferred before?
[02:54:21] <aaron1245> I'm trying to learn how to use it now
[02:54:39] <Cork> ok, deferred works though an object you create and return from the function
[02:54:54] <Cork> this deferred object tracks the specific action
[02:55:01] <aaron1245> yep
[02:55:06] <Cork> you can then .resolve() the object when it is done
[02:55:14] <Cork> and the callbacks added to the object will fire
[02:55:17] <Cork> alternatively
[02:55:23] <Cork> you can return one for each instance
[02:55:32] <aaron1245> so do I make a new deferred object in every each loop
[02:55:34] <Cork> and use $.when() to track them
[02:56:43] <aaron1245> in my fiddle you'll see that i have an each loop that iterates through the "files" variable
[02:57:12] <aaron1245> i'm unsure whether or not I need one $.Deferred or do I make a new one for each iteration?
[03:06:42] <Cork> aaron1245: depends on how you want to expose it
[03:06:51] <Cork> both is doable
[03:07:08] <aaron1245> i just want to run a function once all of the downloads are completed
[03:07:19] <aaron1245> it won't work if i have some that are still running
[03:08:16] <Cork> aaron1245: well it depends on if you want to handle that internally or not
[03:08:22] <Cork> you could use a simple callback
[03:08:33] <Cork> and just call that when all the callbacks has fired
[03:08:54] <Cork> what calls your callbacks isn't part of the pb so it is hard to say what you need
[03:09:08] <aaron1245> ok one sec
[03:10:13] <aaron1245> http://jsfiddle.net/U6wgU/1/
[03:10:40] <aaron1245> so i was thinking about running through the each loop and create an array of promises
[03:10:49] <aaron1245> don't know if thats a good idea or not
[03:11:34] <aaron1245> or if theres a better way to do it.....i don't know..i've been staring at this for 16 hours now and I'm going nuts
[03:13:04] <aaron1245> update again :)
[03:13:05] <aaron1245> http://jsfiddle.net/U6wgU/2/
[03:16:41] <Cork> aaron1245: if one of them fail, what do you want to do then?
[03:16:54] <Cork> should all of it fail, or should they be handled independently?
[03:18:02] <aaron1245> it's fine if the download fails, i'd like it to just skip for now
[03:18:39] <Cork> aaron1245: what i meant is if you use $.when() you will get that things failed if one of the downloads didn't succeeded
[03:18:47] <Cork> so you might want to do it another way
[03:18:59] <aaron1245> i'm using always
[03:19:09] <aaron1245> if that answers your question....ha
[03:19:31] <Cork> not sure i see where you need deferred here
[03:19:34] <aaron1245> if one of the promise states is reject it will be fine
[03:19:44] <Cork> sounds like all you need is a counter and a simple callback
[03:19:56] <aaron1245> the file download part would need some sort of way to tell me when it's done, right?
[03:20:33] <Cork> var active = 0; getFile(...); active++;
[03:20:49] <Cork> if(action > 1) { completed(); }
[03:20:53] <Cork> opps
[03:20:57] <Cork> if(action < 1) { completed(); }
[03:23:08] <cem_1> how to detect combo events
[03:23:33] <Cork> combo?
[03:23:38] <tirengarfio> Any help with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21824334/smooth-scrolling-is-not-working-in-iphone5
[03:24:21] <Cork> cem_1: you have to track the different events if you want to listen for when a series of events has fired
[03:26:39] <aaron1245> Cork are you saying to put that in each iteration of the download?  I have to know when all files are downloaded as I'm going to be running a series of functions to update the code/images/etc
[03:26:54] <Cork> aaron1245: yes
[03:27:06] <Cork> the if case checks in the callbacks from each ajax call
[03:27:14] <Cork> and checks if all the callbacks has fired
[03:27:24] <Cork> when you start a connection you active++
[03:27:38] <Cork> and when it ends (fail or success) you active--
[03:28:09] <aaron1245> that will tell me if that individual file downloaded, but not the whole batch, right?
[03:28:19] <Cork> it sounds like all you need, and should do the job with much less overhead and complexity
[03:28:47] <Cork> aaron1245: no cause when you get a file download callback and active becomes < 1 all is done
[03:29:00] <Cork> you have no more active connections
[03:29:05] <Cork> so it means you are done
[03:37:36] <aaron1245> if I had 50 file downloads for example, i would somewhere/how get a callback that all 50 are done?
[03:38:19] <Cork> aaron1245: file1 start active gets changed to 1
[03:38:27] <Cork> file 2 start active gets moved to 2
[03:38:38] <Cork> file 1 finnishes active gets moved to 1
[03:38:46] <Cork> file 3 start active gets moved to 2
[03:38:56] <Cork> file 3 send active gets moved to 1
[03:39:03] <aaron1245> oooooooo
[03:39:04] <Cork> and file 2 ends and active gets to 0
[03:39:05] <aaron1245> interesting
[03:39:20] <aaron1245> good way to think about that
[03:39:21] <Cork> just remember use active < 1
[03:39:24] <Cork> not active == 0
[03:39:39] <Cork> you don't want dead callbacks cause something happens to get out of sync cause of a bug
[03:39:56] <Cork> so active == -1 should still be a complete callback
[03:40:09] <Cork> (though you might want to get notified about the problem)
[03:58:52] <aaron1245> Thanks so much Cork.
[03:58:58] <Cork> yw
[03:59:05] <aaron1245> I've literally spent all day overthinking this and ...just thanks.
[03:59:05] <aaron1245> ha
[03:59:38] <motaka2> shoky: Hi, are you there?
[04:01:25] <motaka2> Isn't this enough to stop submission on a form event.preventDefault(); ?
[04:01:39] <motaka2> I mean disabling eneter submission at the same tim e
[04:02:02] <Cork> motaka2: yet
[04:02:10] <Cork> on the submit event that is
[04:02:11] <motaka2> Cork: Yet?
[04:02:23] <Cork> unless you do something on click somewhere or something like that
[04:02:45] <motaka2> Cork: I didnt but that doesnt work for me
[04:02:52] <Cork> example?
[04:03:27] <motaka2> wait ...
[04:04:11] <motaka2> Cork: http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/InSearch
[04:04:44] <Cork> wheres the js?
[04:11:56] <Tekla> typeof $('#ui-datepicker-div').val() returns undefined first but then string but if i try to check $('#ui-datepicker-div').val().length it errors out with cannot read property 'length' of undefined :(
[04:12:06] <Tekla> i'm debugging in chrome
[04:16:34] <motaka2> Cork: I think I was dc
[04:17:21] <ZippyV> I have a bit of a problem with learning jQuery Mobile 1.4. The html is not a problem but I have no idea how to structure/architect my js code. Are there any articles out there that could help me?
[04:33:19] <bigbugjava> Hi, Blueimp file upload returns, Error Empty file upload result, the file is uploaded successfuly!.. any reason for that return?
[04:39:27] <Tekla> Cork: jsfiddle.net/S7H97/5/
[04:54:33] <ZeuZ> Why does this allways trigger .fail() even when it does succeed? http://codepad.org/6rxZQoXg
[04:56:46] <Cork> ZeuZ: check the browser console
[04:57:28] <plepzz> Shouldn't you set the dataType to json?
[04:57:35] <ZeuZ> Cork: firebug says nothing..
[04:57:46] <ZeuZ> plepzz, dunno really :P
[04:57:46] <Cork> plepzz: you don't know it is
[04:58:02] <Cork> ZeuZ: there isn't enough info there to answer
[04:58:27] <plepzz> Oh, I thought the dataType relyed on what data was sent to the server. :p
[04:58:31] <Cork> ZeuZ: what content-type header is the server sending back?
[04:58:58] <Cork> plepzz: yes to the server, it doesn't affect the handling of the data coming back
[04:59:04] <ZeuZ> good question, I don't remember that, gonna read the code
[04:59:16] <Cork> ZeuZ: just check the network tab in the browser
[04:59:38] <ZeuZ> Cork, chromium/chrome/derivates of chromium user are you? (yoda style)
[05:00:02] <Cork> ZeuZ: i use chrom some ya
[05:00:35] <Cork> ZeuZ: you can check the header of a response in all modern browsers
[05:02:17] <ZeuZ> what I do not understand is why it alerts the .fail() and then quckly closes it without allowing me to close it manually, to reproduce: fulldownloads.webege.com/index.html?param1=data1
[05:02:26] <ZeuZ> gotta love 000webhost
[05:02:34] <Serdar> Hi, got a stupid question: I am including a settings.js file with <script...> and there are twovariables cfg.host and cfg.port.
[05:02:39] <Cork> closing it?
[05:02:51] <ZeuZ> Cork, try it from there, you'll see what I mean
[05:03:12] <Serdar> how can I use them to say: <script src="http://"+cfg.host+":"+cfg.port></script>?
[05:03:22] <Serdar> +"
[05:03:34] <Serdar> I know that this is not working that way is it possible anyway?
[05:03:44] <Cork> ZeuZ: event.preventDefault() the click event
[05:03:49] <Serdar> or can I include a js file in another js file?
[05:04:01] <Cork> Serdar: you can't really
[05:04:14] <Serdar> Cork, both?
[05:04:20] <Cork> you can create a dom element and set the src url and inject the script in the header
[05:04:33] <Cork> or you can try loading the js file as text through ajax
[05:04:39] <Cork> and the eval the text to javascript
[05:04:48] <Cork> you can't use js in the html
[05:05:34] <Serdar> uh
[05:05:47] <ZeuZ> Cork: you mean something like $('#testButton').on('click',function(){}).preventDefault(); ?
[05:05:54] <Cork> no
[05:05:59] <ZeuZ> chrome works well though it doesnt fire the "ghost click"
[05:06:10] <Serdar> why is including of js files within js files not allowed, I never understood that...
[05:06:11] <Cork> on('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault() /* rest */ });
[05:06:37] <Cork> you need to stop the link you have from changing the page
[05:07:29] <Cork> Serdar: well you normally shouldn't need to
[05:31:22] <anli_> Is not append used to have a div change parent? http://jsfiddle.net/LmkKc/
[05:32:19] <Cork> append or .html should both do it
[05:33:06] <anli_> Hm, strange, must have done a typo in the js there
[05:33:14] <anli_> moveto1 and moveto2 are not recognized as functions
[05:33:32] <Cork> $'#child') => $('#child')
[05:33:49] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LmkKc/1/
[05:33:54] <anli_> doh
[05:33:56] <Cork> also... don't use event attributes
[05:34:07] <anli_> thx :)
[05:34:17] <anli_> I think we have discussed that before
[05:34:25] <anli_> I answer with use them
[05:34:26] <anli_> :)
[05:34:44] <Cork> well it is your funeral when things break cause of it
[05:34:48] <anli_> yeah
[05:41:20] <roxlu> hi guys, I want to change a <source> of a video element based on time of the day. I'm using jquery and setting changing the "src" attribute of a <source>. I've set the "autoplay" for the video tag, but the video is not started when I set it. Can I change video sources in this way?
[05:42:24] <decx> build your video tag dynamically based on time of the day instead of shoehorning a change after the default source is already loaded
[05:42:32] <roxlu> ok
[05:43:21] <usc911> hey guys, would anyone have an example of changing an image based on an input field value? i.e. if the value is 4 use 4.png? cheers
[05:44:37] <decx> $('input').change(function(){ $('myimage').attr('src',$(this).val()+'jpg') })
[05:44:40] <decx> something like this
[05:45:28] <decx> of course you'd have to sanitize the input first
[05:45:40] <usc911> decx: yeah thats kind of what I was thinking
[05:51:54] <Snoopal_> .on('change','select',function() { <-- when i use jQuery(this).val() i get error "cannot call method val of undefinied" any ideas how to solve that?
[05:52:11] <Snoopal_> i want to get the value which was selected
[05:53:27] <shoky> sure you spelled it right?  anyways,  this.value
[05:54:15] <Snoopal_> yes its spelled right :(
[05:54:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[05:57:15] <Snoopal_> one second
[05:58:29] <Snoopal_> http://jsfiddle.net/6mqEv/1/ line 156
[05:58:42] <krambiorixx> hi, i have an input field with a button below it. On the input field i have an autocomplete. WIth the button i can add a new input field with the same class as the first input field. When i add the input field i want it to have autocomplete too... The autocomplete only works on the first input field.... http://jsfiddle.net/ad3gW/
[06:00:53] <shoky> Snoopal_: i meant, a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem. preferably a minimal one
[06:01:13] <Snoopal_> oh. ok one moment pls
[06:01:15] <krambiorixx> shoky , any idea?
[06:02:24] <shoky> krambiorixx: no
[06:04:34] <Snoopal_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/6mqEv/3/ if you change the select to "nein" you get the error in console
[06:05:02] <shoky> Snoopal_: oh. it shows the error is at:  jQuery(this).attr('#smh-input-name').val();
[06:05:07] <shoky> that's wrong
[06:05:15] <shoky> can you see why..
[06:07:37] <Snoopal_> no
[06:07:54] <shoky> whose value do you want to get in that line?
[06:08:21] <joroci> how do you make a synchronous ajax request with jquery version 2?
[06:08:26] <shoky> jQuery(this).attr('#smh-input-name')   means  get the attribute   #smh-input-name  from the <select>
[06:08:28] <Snoopal_> ahhh
[06:08:30] <Snoopal_> now i got it
[06:08:32] <Snoopal_> im an idiot :D
[06:08:40] <Snoopal_> (this) is wrong
[06:08:41] <Snoopal_> grml
[06:08:47] <Snoopal_> thx man!
[06:10:31] <joroci> anyone :)?
[06:14:35] <roxlu> decx: thanks adding a <source> elem. seems to work in Chrome and Firefox, but not in safari
[06:20:01] <jeremib> what's the proper selector for two custom attributes?  $('[data-widget-field="data.thumbnail_size",data-widget-id="42"] ');
[06:20:24] <jeremib> ahh, nm $('[data-widget-field="data.thumbnail_size"][data-widget-id="42"]');
[06:20:48] <specious> joroci: have you tried $.ajax() with async: false?
[06:20:49] <specious> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings
[06:30:29] <joland9> how do i execute javascript with data called w JSON?
[06:30:58] <joland9> http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/
[06:35:56] <Cork> joland9: how?
[06:36:02] <Cork> you get it from the jaax call
[06:36:14] <Cork> *ajax
[06:36:24] <Cork> and then you just pass it to where you want to have it
[06:36:52] <BinaryKitten> jaax Just Another AjaX
[06:37:11] <Cork> :)
[06:40:06] <joland9> yes that is what i do.. but the js doesn't respond when its loaded with json
[06:40:13] <joland9> check out the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/
[06:42:38] <joland9> bottom line... incoke JS like this?
[06:42:40] <joland9> $('#outputData.li[id^="go"]').each(function(e){
[06:43:02] <joland9> like this? $('#outputData.li[id^="go"]').each(function(e){
[06:43:19] <Cork> joland9: no dot
[06:43:31] <Cork> unless li[id^="go"] is a class name
[06:43:41] <joland9> without dot i tried as well.. but that didn't help
[06:44:03] <joland9> in the body i have this <div id="outputData"></div>
[06:44:37] <Cork> hmm i think i missed something here
[06:44:40] <joland9> so i thought i needed to invoke WITH the id like this:  $('#outputData li[id^="go"]').each(function(e){
[06:45:16] <Cork> $('#outputData.li[id^="go"]') will add a listener to all elements that when the selector runs has an id attribute that starts with go
[06:45:29] <Cork> (this is a horribly bad practis; use classes!)
[06:45:35] <joland9> side note: Without JSON, and having the data on the same page this works: $('li[id^="go"]').each(function(e){
[06:45:44] <Cork> if you later add content to the page it does nothing to this
[06:45:46] <joland9> omg
[06:45:50] <joland9> classes?
[06:46:02] <Cork> <li id="uniq" class="go">
[06:46:11] <joland9> ok
[06:46:36] <joland9> but how to invoke from there... having this line in mind: $('li[id^="go"]').each(function(e){
[06:46:57] <Cork> so after you append you want to find the new li's?
[06:47:06] <joland9> besides..... why classes if i use an unique ids????
[06:47:10] <krambiorixx> howcome this doesn't work?
[06:47:11] <krambiorixx> http://jsfiddle.net/U4ffz/32/
[06:47:20] <Cork> joland9: cause you want to use your id's as classes
[06:47:22] <Cork> and they arn't
[06:47:33] <Cork> joland9: [id="go"] != #go
[06:47:50] <Cork> the first is an attribute selector the second is and id
[06:48:00] <joland9> i know its not the same... but is should work with ids too no?!
[06:48:06] <Cork> the first will loop over all elements the element selector to the left matches
[06:48:14] <Cork> and check each of them if the string matches
[06:48:27] <Cork> the id selector checks an id hash in the browser
[06:48:31] <Cork> and is VERY fast
[06:48:52] <Cork> joland9: no you can't do "starts with" selecting on id's
[06:48:55] <Cork> only on attributes
[06:49:02] <joland9> hmmm... i see
[06:49:16] <Cork> and that is cause you shouldn't use id's like that
[06:49:23] <joland9> so ur saying i got multiple ids, in this case?
[06:49:28] <Cork> no
[06:49:31] <Cork> use classes
[06:49:53] <Cork> <li id="go' + valueb.id + '" class="go">
[06:50:04] <Cork> $('#outputData li.go')
[06:50:09] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, how to pass a jQuery and PHP variable in ajax data request, Trying this but getting an error data: {$(this).sortable('serialize'), <?php echo $id ?> }
[06:50:21] <joland9> could you edit my fiddle
[06:50:37] <joland9> http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/
[06:50:54] <krambiorixx> Cork, any idea?
[06:50:55] <Cork> the problem is deeper then this
[06:51:06] <Cork> joland9: the problem is with the delegation i talked about before
[06:52:07] <Cork> joland9: and the code can't really be fixed up as the each loop up there doesn't handle new elements added through ajax
[06:53:06] <joland9> any docs on this? cos its a bit confusing
[06:54:51] <Cork> joland9: something like this might work http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/1/
[06:55:13] <Cork> but not fully sure cause of the confusing structure of your original code
[06:55:19] <Cork> opps
[06:55:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/2/ <-- typo fix
[06:56:09] <Cork> krambiorixx: are you use autocomplete is created
[06:56:20] <Cork> i though it was ui-autocomplete or ui.autocomplete
[06:56:36] <joland9> li go isn't a class btw (ur pref. statement)... its a id as well...
[06:56:36] <Cork> ya 'ui-autocomplete'
[06:56:37] <joland9> <ol>
[06:56:38] <joland9>       <li id="go1" class='blok1 element bestof'><a href="#go1"></a>
[06:56:38] <joland9> 		<div>
[06:57:01] <Cork> joland9: so use a static class name
[06:57:13] <Cork> in addition to the ones you need to the other parts
[06:57:29] <Cork> though uniqly numbered class names is kinda pointless
[06:57:39] <Cork> just like grouping with id's is pointless
[06:58:06] <krambiorixx> Cork, i don't follow what you're saying...
[06:58:15] <Cork> classes is for grouping elements and id for uniquely identifying an element
[06:58:36] <Cork> krambiorixx: data('autocomplete') => data('ui-autocomplete')
[06:58:45] <joland9> i edited ur fiddle to show a sample of the data
[06:58:46] <joland9> http://jsfiddle.net/6744e/3/
[06:59:09] <Cork> joland9: ya, then the code i changed should work
[07:00:53] <joland9> awesome, let me try that
[07:01:11] <Cork> joland9: like i said, as long as i read your code correctly
[07:03:22] <krambiorixx> Cork, doesn't change a thing : http://jsfiddle.net/U4ffz/33/
[07:04:22] <Cork> krambiorixx: what is the problem your trying to solve?
[07:05:18] <krambiorixx> Cork, after adding an input box, setting autocomplete on it
[07:05:31] <Cork> btw $(".live").live != $(".live").on
[07:05:34] <Serdar> happy happy happy happy :)
[07:05:50] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '.live') is
[07:06:02] <Trisox> hey corkie :D
[07:06:21] <Cork> krambiorixx: so the focus listener you have at the top won't match anything
[07:06:26] <Trisox> bind it on document ;) helps true! every new instance works then
[07:06:33] <Cork> cause it tries to add to the .live classes that exists as the page loads
[07:06:59] <joland9> cork: ALMOST!!!! :) when i click on a box not That one but 2 boxes before open...
[07:07:06] <Cork> i sooo HATE that ppl say on is the new live...
[07:07:09] <Trisox> event delegation ! :D
[07:07:14] <Cork> ppl gets so confused
[07:07:19] <Cork> it's not even funny...
[07:07:25] <Trisox> its not true
[07:07:39] <Cork> no delegate is the replacement for live
[07:07:51] <Cork> it had a completely different way of thinking
[07:08:00] <Cork> and on doesn't really have anything to do with it
[07:08:15] <Cork> on just merges two commands into one
[07:08:28] <Trisox> no true but $(document).on('click', '.live' <-- this does
[07:08:52] <Cork> Trisox: sorry?
[07:09:25] <Trisox> meaning Document is where its bound to
[07:09:44] <Cork> what is the difference to what i said before?
[07:09:47] <Trisox> when new .live instance is created
[07:09:50] <Trisox> nothing !
[07:09:54] <Cork> -_-'
[07:10:01] <Trisox> but don't think he got it...
[07:10:02] <delboy1978uk> how do i get the contents of a textarea?
[07:10:11] <Cork> delboy1978uk: .val()
[07:10:19] <Cork> ?api val
[07:10:19] <b-ot> Cork: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[07:10:24] <delboy1978uk> ? i thought it was .html for that! ok thanks
[07:10:37] <Cork> delboy1978uk: val() is for all form elements
[07:10:45] <Trisox> but cork whats up
[07:10:46] <Cork> well except for label :)
[07:10:51] <Cork> Trisox: nothing much
[07:10:56] <Trisox> thats not good
[07:11:01] <Cork> ?
[07:11:08] <Cork> why not? :D
[07:11:15] <Trisox> boored
[07:11:27] <Trisox> i might get a new assignment at work
[07:11:27] <Cork> it's nice to note be droned in work for once
[07:11:52] <Trisox> working with kendo-ui...
[07:12:04] <Cork> ah
[07:12:17] <joland9> YES... awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:12:41] <joland9> cork! You are the TOP DOG!!!!
[07:12:49] <Cork> heh
[07:12:52] <Trisox> cork did you ever worked with kendo?
[07:12:59] <Cork> joland9: i'll take it you got it working :)(
[07:13:08] <joland9> thats right buddy
[07:13:10] <Cork> Trisox: no
[07:13:14] <Trisox> me either
[07:13:14] <joland9> sweet jesus
[07:13:26] <Cork> Trisox: i've looked at it, but haven't had to fiddle with it
[07:13:41] <joland9> i really need to get my head around json an such
[07:13:43] <Trisox> joland9 getting it to work is one think do you grasp what it does?
[07:13:55] <Trisox> ah :D
[07:14:02] <joland9> trisox... that the thing...
[07:14:06] <joland9> +s
[07:14:21] <Cork> joland9: the solution has little to do with json
[07:14:28] <Cork> and all to do with event delegation
[07:14:36] <joland9> i understand php pretty well.. buy JS.. remains too much of a mistery
[07:14:49] <Cork> the each loop you had before looped elements that existed when the page loaded
[07:15:08] <joland9> i see
[07:15:11] <Cork> and added a static num attribute to the element (use the data- prefix for made up values)
[07:15:30] <Cork> it then added a click handler to each of the not found elements :)
[07:15:39] <joland9> any tips... where i can do some study on this?
[07:15:47] <Cork> i replaced that with a delegated event listener that existed on the outputData element
[07:15:59] <Cork> and it used the offset in the match array to get the index instead
[07:16:05] <Cork> so no need for the num attribute
[07:16:24] <Cork> also always A-L-W-A-Y-S! declare your variables
[07:16:34] <joland9> got it!
[07:17:08] <Cork> i actually didn't touch the ajax call at all
[07:17:27] <Cork> oh right
[07:17:31] <joland9> yes, i noticed that
[07:17:37] <Trisox> cork just read about  toploading that js does like few days back...
[07:17:52] <Cork> i replaced li[id^="go"] with li.blkn (or what it's name was)
[07:18:02] <Cork> but that again was in the selector
[07:18:12] <joland9> $('#outputData').on('click', 'li.blok', function() {
[07:18:13] <joland9>             var num = $('#outputData li.blok').index(this);
[07:18:27] * Cork nods
[07:19:03] <joland9> so its all about JS right?
[07:19:14] <Cork> well it is all about dom actually
[07:19:39] <Cork> delegated event listeners work by attaching to a parent to the dynamic element
[07:19:48] <Cork> and then listen as the event bubble up the tree
[07:20:06] <joland9> right... like xml
[07:20:19] <Cork> xml?
[07:20:30] <Cork> what do xml have to do with events?
[07:20:39] <joland9> tree wise
[07:21:06] <Cork> well xml isn't actually a tree :)
[07:21:15] <joland9> ok.. never mind...
[07:21:17] <joland9> :)
[07:21:24] <Cork> dom or document parsed from xml or html is a tree
[07:21:58] <joland9> trying to put in my 2 cents... but its probably worth 0,01 cent
[07:22:49] <Cork> but yes when you in code work with xml and html both is represented by a tree structure
[07:23:03] <joland9> good to hear :)
[07:23:37] <joland9> my knowledge to dom and JS is simply not sufficient
[07:25:59] <joland9> thanks again... i will do some serious studying on those
[07:27:56] <Cork> joland9: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/ might be interesting
[07:28:03] <Cork> (the javascript parts)
[07:28:38] <joland9> thanks, i will look into those
[07:37:35] <clime> hey, I have a slight problem jquery datepicker. If an input it is attached to is in div with margin: 0px auto and you zoom in (ctrl +), displayed datepicker does not keep its position relative to the input. There are no troubles when "margin: 0px auto" is removed.
[07:37:38] <clime> http://jsfiddle.net/hcvfC/1/
[07:38:06] <clime> It causes some problems in mobile browsers when there is an automatic zoom-in.

[07:57:03] <misterman> hi
[07:58:46] <misterman> I'm trying to use data attributes to change classes to some elements. I have a ul with some li's and each one has a data-year attribute. I'm trying to match the data-year attribute from the li's to the data-year attrib I have on some links. http://jsfiddle.net/76KCp/
[07:59:02] <misterman> What's the correct way of doing this?
[07:59:52] <misterman> Like, if I click on an li with data-year="2008" make all of the links with attrib data-year="2008" have some class, or change color.
[08:05:28] <misterman> No way to do that?
[08:05:38] <xKraty> @misterman hold on
[08:06:37] <xKraty> @misterman like that? $('a.cargar-proyecto[data-year="'+$(this).data('year')+'"').addClass('sexy');
[08:08:32] <misterman> xKraty: hmmm, wow i was trying something completely different
[08:09:17] <xKraty> misterman: i'm used to do like that, not sure if it's best way, but should work!
[08:09:47] <misterman> xKraty: i'll try it right now, it looks fine to me though. Hadn't thought of it that way. Thanks!
[08:10:01] <xKraty> misterman: np :)
[08:10:05] <BillCriswell> misterman: Are you changing the data attribute by doing .data('year') in your code?
[08:10:39] <misterman> BillCriswell: I was going to get the data attribute by doing that
[08:10:45] <misterman> *get the value
[08:11:52] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:13:02] <misterman> BillCriswell: but xKraty aproach seems faster though. I was going for the long road.
[08:15:32] <dash_x> sup guys
[08:15:50] <BillCriswell> My concern was if you change it like $('div').data('year', 2013); you can't query it by that year through an attribute selector.
[08:17:11] <dash_x> I was having some issues with Jquery over the weekend using the .data() function as well. So I called data('key', value) to set a data-* on a <li> element, and then I have an event listener to respond to the click of that element. The problem is that inside of the event listener, event.currentTarget does not see the data-* attribute on the <li>
[08:17:13] <dash_x> any ideas?
[08:17:52] <BillCriswell> misterman: http://jsbin.com/tazuyuca/1/edit?html,js,output Illustrates my concern.
[08:18:13] <dash_x> by the way, my value in this case is a javascript Object
[08:18:40] <dash_x> I am stuck at this point..
[08:19:32] <BillCriswell> dash_x: Doing .data() doesn't effect the data- attribute.
[08:19:49] <BillCriswell> .attr('data-key', value) should work for you though.
[08:19:50] <Sendoushi> it only retrieves right BillCriswell ?
[08:20:06] <BillCriswell> Sendoushi: Yeah I think so. Playing with it now.
[08:20:41] <xKraty> misterman: you could also use the .filter() for selecting what you want http://jsfiddle.net/NCmP4/
[08:21:31] <xKraty> BillCriswell: he didn't want to change the value, you are right if you wanna edit the attribute you have to use .prop() (.attr() is deprecated )
[08:21:40] <xKraty> *if he
[08:21:49] <BillCriswell> attr isn't deprecated
[08:22:46] <dash_x> BillCriswell: I could have swore that I tried, the .attr('data-key', value) and then tried retrieving it. Let me ask you this, does data-key need to be present in the markup already, or will it create it if not?
[08:23:08] <BillCriswell> dash_x: http://jsbin.com/tazuyuca/1/edit migtht help clear some things up.
[08:23:11] <Sendoushi> dash_x, it will create if not
[08:23:22] <Sendoushi> attr() creates / modifies or retrieves
[08:23:34] <misterman> Oh, quite a convo i missed
[08:23:35] <Sendoushi> (from what i know)
[08:24:06] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/tazuyuca/2/edit with comments.
[08:24:09] <dash_x> so .data('key') just retrieves html attribute data-key ?
[08:24:40] <decx> it also retrieves the property data-key if you set it somewhere
[08:24:51] <dash_x> I don't understand usage of .data('key', value) ?
[08:24:52] <BillCriswell> dash_x: It can also set, but it won't set the attribute itself.
[08:25:11] <decx> dash_x data('key',value) sets a property
[08:25:41] <decx> that isnt reflected in the data-attribute but a hidden data-* property that is bound to that element
[08:25:55] <dash_x> Ok, that makes sense with what I read
[08:26:05] <dash_x> Let me give this a shot, and get back to you
[08:26:15] <xKraty> BillCriswell: my bad
[08:26:36] <dash_x> there seems to be quite of confusion with this on the internet
[08:26:37] <BillCriswell> xKraty: All good! It seems like it is sometimes with the amount of times I go to use it and actually ened .prop though.
[08:27:04] <decx> so if you do $('.myelement').data('key','value') then <div class="myelement data-key=""> doesnt change but when you do $('.myelement').data('key') you get the new value you set before
[08:27:04] <BillCriswell> s/ened/need
[08:27:51] <misterman> Learning a lot here ;)
[08:28:04] <BillCriswell> I think I actually confused myself in the process.
[08:28:15] <misterman> lol
[08:28:46] <misterman> I'm just using the data attrib to filter/style some articles like a fast visual filter
[08:29:25] <xKraty> BillCriswell: just re-read the docs, the .prop get the dynamic state of the document
[08:30:01] <xKraty> BillCriswell: so the .attr is deprecated in my mind cause i hardly need that value :P
[08:30:42] <fatguylaughing> I want to make an interactive dungeon building tool for games. Kinda like how mockingbird does wireframes (https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/). Would it be better to use javascript or jQuery for something like that?
[08:30:45] <xKraty> misterman: so my solution should be fine for you
[08:30:56] <misterman> xKraty: exactly!
[08:32:25] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: i swear you need something more powerfull like angularjs, you could do it with javascript but i swear it's a pain!
[08:32:38] <dash_x> am I able to get data-* from event.currentTarget ?
[08:32:44] <decx> angular is js :o
[08:32:57] <fatguylaughing> xKraty: Isn't ^ what he said
[08:33:11] <decx> fatguylaughing i'd say you're better off trying to get familiar with painting on the canvas
[08:33:11] <xKraty> decx: vanilla js :P
[08:33:21] <decx> instead of fiddling with the dom
[08:33:39] <fatguylaughing> decx: Not 100% sure what you mean by painting on the canvas.
[08:33:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/papeloze/1/edit?html,js,output Weee
[08:34:56] <decx> fatguylaughing instead of doing your app with html markup you can use the canvas tag & js to have a more powerful/performant tool
[08:35:28] <BinaryKitten> dash_x event.currentTarget.getAttribute('data-xxxxxx') .....
[08:35:30] <fatguylaughing> decx: Thanks - I didn't know that.
[08:35:31] <decx> especially for a dungeon builder you want to be able to actually draw stuff
[08:35:41] <decx> instead of just moving around elements
[08:36:07] <decx> but beware, once you open the canvas floodgates you're in for a lot of work ^^
[08:36:12] <fatguylaughing> decx: Well I was thinking of giving some pre-defined things that can be drag and dropped. But also let them build from scratch too.
[08:36:28] <fatguylaughing> decx: Fun
[08:36:42] <fatguylaughing> decx: So Normal js and canvas right?
[08:36:55] <decx> yeah i gathered, if you hit a roadblock with canvas you can do a simple drag&drop interface with jqueryui
[08:37:40] <decx> yeah but you can also write coffeescript or whatever and then just compile to js
[08:37:46] <decx> whatever you're most comfortable with
[08:38:02] <dash_x> BinaryKitten: it's still not working.. I'll paste my code
[08:38:25] <decx> if you hate yourself enough you can also do it with svg instead of canvas ;)
[08:38:59] <BinaryKitten> svg manipulation = fun (for those that like that sort of thing)
[08:39:04] <Trisox> decx lol
[08:39:06] <fatguylaughing> ... shit what am I getting my self into lol
[08:39:37] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: will you survive?
[08:39:51] <Trisox> BinaryKitten something i love to stay away from :D
[08:39:54] <fatguylaughing> xKraty: I have for five years doing code so ... no probably not lol
[08:40:04] <Trisox> gave it a year back..
[08:40:39] <Trisox> 5 years should be enough..
[08:41:04] <Trisox> depending on your skill level :D
[08:41:08] <fatguylaughing> Trisox: Yeah but it's not in JS :(
[08:41:11] <fatguylaughing> lol
[08:41:17] <Trisox> if your a dungon master ...
[08:41:26] <fatguylaughing> Trisox: lol don't even start :D
[08:41:33] <Trisox> haha
[08:41:49] <fatguylaughing> I like your attitude lol
[08:41:50] <Trisox> ill stop trolling your cave dude dont worry
[08:41:51] <Trisox> :D
[08:42:10] <fatguylaughing> Well thanks everyone for the hurtful and painful ideas on where to die in JS
[08:42:12] <Trisox> *dungon
[08:42:13] <fatguylaughing> I'm on my way!
[08:42:21] <fatguylaughing> Trisox: lol
[08:42:43] <Trisox> i would use some kinda lib for sure ;-)
[08:42:46] <Trisox> fatguylaughing
[08:42:48] <decx> i brought a whole bucket of red herring
[08:43:06] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: if it's your own project you should get into it!
[08:43:16] <Trisox> decx thats sounds fishy what is it ;d
[08:43:19] <fatguylaughing> Wait before I go lol decx wth is sag.... lol I know i shouldn't ask
[08:43:52] <fatguylaughing> xKraty: Yeah it's not work related - but I could use some JS experience which will help me more at my job so it's a win win.
[08:43:59] <fatguylaughing> svg
[08:44:01] <fatguylaughing> not sag lol
[08:44:09] <fatguylaughing> decx: ^
[08:44:16] <decx> i was about to say, ask your granny
[08:44:22] <fatguylaughing> decx: lol
[08:44:39] <fatguylaughing> Trisox: Yeah I'll try to find some libs
[08:44:47] <decx> svg is an imageformat in xml
[08:45:02] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: you still can do it with jquery ui, is not that hard
[08:45:12] <mortal1> can you $(selector, undefined), will it just use the selector?
[08:45:15] <Trisox> decx duh
[08:45:32] <decx> ye jquery ui would be the path of least resistance
[08:46:06] <fatguylaughing> Yeah I'm looking for best performance versus least resistance. Not sure if that still means jquery ui
[08:46:57] <decx> you'll end up with about 5000 draggables but it'll work http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[08:48:06] <xKraty> look positive! just 5000! lol
[08:48:20] <Trisox> over 5000!!
[08:48:27] <Trisox> haha :d
[08:48:29] <fatguylaughing> lol
[08:48:45] <xKraty> you should make a function over9000
[08:48:49] <xKraty> would be awesome
[08:48:52] <Trisox> if you manage that you got some serieus power level to your dungon !
[08:48:59] <Trisox> xKraty true
[08:49:28] <Trisox> time to go eat something!!
[08:49:36] <xKraty> enjoy!
[08:49:59] <Trisox> thnx dont feel like cooking 2day
[08:50:04] <Trisox> :)
[08:50:10] <xKraty> order a pizza!
[08:50:27] <Trisox> nahh i feel like fries
[08:50:47] <xKraty> :O
[08:50:49] <xKraty> yum!
[08:51:08] <Trisox> i almost never get something mostly cook my self but sometimes ...
[08:51:11] <xKraty> oh cool 10minutes left for me :D, i'll go for a pizza then!
[08:51:16] <Trisox> bbl!
[08:51:50] <BillCriswell> icomoon.io is so awesome.
[08:52:03] <xKraty> yeah loads of icons!
[08:54:07] <BillCriswell> The whole system is well done I think.
[08:54:18] <dash_x> BinaryKitten: now my code is working fine in jsbin.com
[08:55:00] <dash_x> I am using an old Jquery plugin in my project, maybe I should upgrade :/
[08:55:03] <dash_x> doh
[08:58:05] <decx> i'm playing around with a concept for a horizontal menu that doesn't need to collapse on smaller screensizes can somebody give feedback on the viability of ui like that? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ecp5C/
[08:59:54] <BillCriswell> decx: Not having much luck with the drag?
[09:00:18] <BillCriswell> Unless it's only for touch.
[09:00:33] <decx> drag doesnt work for you?
[09:00:48] <decx> i did a pseudo touch for mouse testing
[09:00:49] <decx> ;)
[09:02:07] <BillCriswell> I can't get the drag to work at all.
[09:02:49] <decx> hm strange
[09:03:28] <decx> it's a concept so i just tested on win ff&chrome so maybe i missed something specific to mac
[09:04:11] <decx> save the last clickpoint x, on mouseup compare pageX to the last clickpoint
[09:04:15] <decx> should be fine
[09:04:33] <BillCriswell> decx: I might be doing something wrong. I can't get it to work in windows chrome either.
[09:05:03] <decx> that doesnt bode well for a prototype ;)
[09:05:12] <Vivekananda> a lot of people around
[09:05:12] <decx> *ui-prototype
[09:05:18] <Vivekananda> I did not find anyone yesterday
[09:05:32] <Vivekananda> and on top of that my system crashed so installing fresh uubntu
[09:05:37] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: It was Sunday... now everyone is at work bored out of their mind.
[09:05:41] <Vivekananda> and getting a permissions denied on apache
[09:05:45] <Vivekananda> lol
[09:05:51] <Vivekananda> I wonder what to do
[09:11:05] <Trisox[away]> brr cold out side
[09:13:12] <BillCriswell> Cold here as well, about 30F.
[09:13:48] <duch_kazatel> it's around 45 here.

[09:19:04] <gervx> hi, can I have two binding events ? $("#id").one("click", function (event) { do x; } $("#id").on("click", function(event) { do y; } now it seems that .on overrides .one
[09:20:48] <gervx> ok works nvm
[09:20:48] <gervx> :)
[09:20:57] <BillCriswell> gervx: Haha there you go.
[09:23:01] <BillCriswell> Oh shit, just tried something in php and it worked.
[09:23:11] <BillCriswell> json_decode($response, TRUE)['echo']['results'] say whaattt
[09:23:50] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: lol
[09:23:58] <tw2113> stop dividing by 42, BillCriswell
[09:24:10] <fatguylaughing> but it's the answer!
[09:24:29] <BillCriswell> I thought for sure I would have to do $json = json_decode($response, TRUE); $products = $json['echo']['results']
[09:24:52] <tw2113> or at least echo $json['echo']['results']
[09:25:03] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: The first version is shorthand.
[09:25:19] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: I thought I've tried that in the past and it just said "nope".
[09:25:19] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Be careful using it. Someone else might look and think it's broken code.
[09:25:23] <BillCriswell> It has been a while though.
[09:25:53] <jqueryQuery> quick question: does anyone know why the jquery mouse* function (e.g., mouseover, mouseenter) aren't camelCased like the rest of the jquery??
[09:26:02] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Yeah - I stay away from it just because i know some of my co-workers would look at it and go wtf is this?
[09:26:26] <duch_kazatel> jqueryQuery no idea.  probably because they're shorthands?
[09:26:29] <Jattenalle> jqueryQuery, the events are not camelcased, see for example keyup, keypress etc
[09:26:38] <jqueryQuery> ahh i see thanks!
[09:26:52] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: I actually went with what I "thought for sure I'd have to do" since I Find it a bit more readable, but for quick stuff it's good to know!
[09:27:03] <Jattenalle> not sure if it applies to all events, or just the "standard html event names" so to speak
[09:27:14] <duch_kazatel> probably just the standard DOM ones.
[09:27:25] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: right on
[09:27:31] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Well have fun :)
[09:27:40] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, downside of doing it the quick and dirty way is that you dont get access to the decoded json for later use
[09:27:58] <Jattenalle> but if all you need is a single value, hell yeah shorthand :3
[09:28:11] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Understood. I only needed the results from it.
[09:30:26] <decx> i had to do php last week and it wasnt for a wordpress theme, nearly killed myself
[09:30:55] <Jattenalle> php is great though, if you like looking up the order of parameters every single time you use a function
[09:31:12] <Jattenalle> and the naming convetion is awesome, keeps you on your toes.. is it camelcase or _ ?
[09:31:16] * mortal1 gr
[09:32:54] <mortal1> so, I'm trying to parse selectors out of query parms
[09:33:20] <mortal1> but decodeURIComponent returns "".foo""
[09:33:41] <mortal1> which jquery then turns around and barfs on
[09:34:18] <mortal1> other than some idiotic substring off start / end chars, is there a better way to get rid of those extra "s
[09:34:52] <mortal1> i can't just s.replace '"' ''
[09:35:07] <mortal1> because I could legitimately have "s in there
[09:36:11] <duch_kazatel> mortal1 could you supply an example?
[09:36:17] <duch_kazatel> of your code, I mean.
[09:37:01] <Velveeta> s.replace(/^"|"$/, '') ?
[09:37:22] <Velveeta> i'm assuming you can't just do a .replace('"', '') because there are also embedded quotes
[09:37:57] <Velveeta> er, yeah, i guess you said that :D
[09:38:08] <mortal1> Velveeta: ...that looks enticing
[09:38:43] <Velveeta> if you think *that* looks enticing, you should see one of my pb&j sammiches
[09:39:25] <decx> don't forget the meat to make it a real sandwich ;)
[09:41:27] <Velveeta> lol
[09:43:49] <leonidg> Hi everyone. I'm looking at some legacy code that is using sortable. Many of its callbacks reference ui.element (e.g. the over() callback). This doesn't seem to exist as of 1.10
[09:44:01] <leonidg> was it renamed to something?
[10:04:33] <_disconnect_> hi, does anybody know how to use this POS http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox/
[10:05:20] <_disconnect_> it keeps writing writing my date in YYYY-MM-DD format even though i'm telling it not to in 3 different ways
[10:05:43] <coldhead> maybe it expects reverse psychology
[10:06:46] <_disconnect_> coldhead, now that is the kind of outside of the box thinking taht will get you ahead in this organization
[10:08:45] <decx> NOTE:: To override, use overrideNameOfOption - e.g. overrideTimeFormat
[10:08:50] <Trisox> haha coldhead
[10:10:12] <_disconnect_> im in hell
[10:11:55] <jlucas> _disconnect_  How's the ping time?
[10:12:36] <_disconnect_> surprisingly good
[10:12:40] <decx> it's 0, because hell has aethernet
[10:14:51] <igcewieling> dismist: I use query-ui-timepicker-addon.js don't recall the site.  \don't know it will do what you want, and it seems understandable even by a n00b like me.
[10:17:20] <SocialEvil> i am using caroufredsel to make some images croll automatically. but when i click the next,prev buttons in order to change directions of scrolling, there is some delay (in order to finish some animation), is there a way to do this without waiting the animation to finish ?
[10:17:31] <jop008> My website loops over records and build up a string and send them to the client how to build in paginating?
[10:17:42] <jop008> Show 50 records and then next 50
[10:17:47] <jop008> by user action
[10:19:07] <_disconnect_> I FREAKING GOT IT! yeahhhh!
[10:19:57] <Armistice> Has anyone got any good plugins for allowing tabs in a textarea?
[10:20:32] <decx> i'm gonna go out on a limb and say it'll be more sane to put textareas in tabs
[10:20:56] <Armistice> Not that kind of tab, tab as in an indent using the tab key. :P
[10:20:58] <decx> oh you mean tabs as in space
[10:21:02] <decx> lol
[10:21:19] <_disconnect_> is it \s?
[10:21:24] <_disconnect_> try \s
[10:23:22] <decx> textarea.on keydown keycode 9 add spaces instead of switching focus
[10:23:31] <decx> something like that
[10:23:45] <decx> isn't that "code" beautiful
[10:24:11] <_disconnect_> this works. $("textarea").html("&nbsp;abc")
[10:24:21] <_disconnect_> i didnt know &nbsp; would work inside a textarea
[10:26:28] <Armistice> yeah. the plugin i have detects for the browser, and most of it is in javascript and i wasn't aware of the jquery equivalent but i managed to find it after some googling. going to see what i can come up wit hnow
[10:27:00] <Armistice> argh now i remember why i stopped using freenode's webchat. the scrollbar doesn't scrolldown automatically anymore.
[10:29:06] <Armistice> if yu have a keypress and you use an e.preventDefault(); do you need to return false too?
[10:30:33] <Ownix> the block on line 33 runs even though the block on 14 is false, http://pastie.org/private/8kaims4o7xiltygkfjgow
[10:31:06] <BillCriswell> Armistice: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1357151/191226 This answer here sums it up perfectly.
[10:31:10] <Ownix> can someone help me figure out why? Im a C# guyso this is a little confusing, usually nothing within a block will run if the conditional for that block is not met
[10:31:46] <BillCriswell> Ownix: hasClass returns a boolean.
[10:32:24] <BillCriswell> if ( ! itemInHand.hasClass('brick') ) { } should do what You want.
[10:32:46] <Ownix> ah I see, so 0 != false?
[10:33:57] <Armistice> Thanks BillCriswell :)
[10:33:58] <BillCriswell> Hmm...
[10:34:04] <duch_kazatel> 0 == false
[10:34:07] <BillCriswell> 0 == false
[10:34:09] <BillCriswell> Ha
[10:34:34] <clarkk> I have selected a set of elements, and hidden them all at once, using $myselection.hide().  This works fine. How do I ensure that the next statement does not run until the page has finished rerendering/hiding?  I've tried to use a function in the 'complete' argument, but this runs
[10:34:34] <clarkk> the statement for every element in the selection
[10:34:37] <BillCriswell> So that should work? I dunno.
[10:35:10] <duch_kazatel> what value does itemInHand.hasClass("brick") have?
[10:35:26] <duch_kazatel> because I'm guessing it's not what you think.
[10:35:42] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I'm thinking that now as well.
[10:35:54] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet this is one of those cases where type coercion is biting you in the ass.
[10:36:11] <duch_kazatel> Ownix - do a console.log of itemInHand.hasClass("brick")
[10:36:34] <fr4nk> hi there
[10:36:49] <fr4nk> somebody experiences with jquery mobile?
[10:36:56] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ fr4nk
[10:36:56] <b-ot> fr4nk: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:37:13] <fr4nk> ...
[10:37:38] <fr4nk> i use a panel, but it doesnt close if the page is the same i want to navigate to
[10:37:45] <fr4nk> panel has list view as navigation
[10:38:05] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I did but my main issues were coming from the clone() thing. Its confusing to understand what adding "true" inside clone() does, especially when everything behind draggable, droppable ect. seems like magic to me
[10:39:04] <duch_kazatel> Ownix putthat closing curly and else on the same line, first of all.
[10:39:21] <BillCris_> Internet is stupid.
[10:39:55] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: got it
[10:40:04] <BillCris_> Armistice: No problem.
[10:40:18] <duch_kazatel> Ownix that help at all?
[10:41:50] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: the main issue was fixed when they told me to do == false instead of == 0
[10:41:58] <Ownix> but I have another monster to tackle here in a second
[10:42:08] <duch_kazatel> Ownix don't use == when possible.
[10:42:11] <duch_kazatel> use ===
[10:42:26] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't be relying on type coercion as much as possible.
[10:42:26] <Ownix> ah
[10:42:34] <BillCriswell> Using === on something that returns a boolean seems bad? I could be wrong about that.
[10:42:53] <duch_kazatel> it is bad.,
[10:43:13] <duch_kazatel> especially when comparing those booleans against 0.  know what you're comparing.
[10:46:42] <duch_kazatel> hence my suggestion that you console log that method.
[11:04:16] <Ownix> What happens if this is called on an item that doesnt have a draggable event attached to it? $(ui.draggable).draggable('destroy');
[11:05:38] <duch_kazatel> Ownix probably nothing.
[11:05:59] <duch_kazatel> a lot of the jquery/jqueryui stuff checks things for you to prevent errors.
[11:06:04] <Ownix> No explosions?
[11:06:12] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't, but I could be wrong.
[11:06:14] <duch_kazatel> did you try?
[11:06:26] <Ownix> I just found my last hurdle, I had to call that on one of my dragged items. Im doin an append on the drop event like the "shopping cart" example
[11:08:00] <Ownix> Every time I do an append/remove im also calling a function that calld .draggable(); on my list again, is there a better way to do this?
[11:08:08] <Ownix>  otherwise fresh items added to my list wont be draggable
[11:14:22] <duch_kazatel> Ownix are you appending a cloned copy?
[11:14:29] <duch_kazatel> I'd look at something like http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[11:14:36] <duch_kazatel> to keep data and events.
[11:38:03] <duch_kazatel> Interesting read about carousels and how bad they are: http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/
[11:42:38] <decx> confirms my own tests, don't use excessive content movement without user interaction
[11:43:39] <decx> even that new fad of having a little animation when an objects comes into the viewport is a turn off
[11:44:28] <decx> like a content box that slides in from the right when you scroll down
[11:44:31] <decx> ugh
[11:49:41] <duch_kazatel> those are awful.
[11:49:58] <kkkuj> http://jsfiddle.net/Y2wD3/
[11:51:06] <BillCriswell> kkkuj: You're trying to append the document.body in an <h3> tag it looks like.
[11:51:11] <BillCriswell> Not sure what your issue is yet, though.
[11:51:29] <kkkuj> when the button clicked must launch the loading gif during 3 seconds and then receive the "var res"
[11:52:14] <decx> i prefer to have a .loading class with a center center loading gif background that i add on click an remove on callback
[11:53:45] <kkkuj> decx: can you try on the jsfiddle?
[11:53:48] <BillCriswell> kkkuj: You're trying to put some code after document.body on the first line and trying to put document.body inside an h3 after that.
[11:54:35] <BillCriswell> Also not sure what the first line is going for at all.
[11:55:29] <BillCriswell> kkkuj: http://jsfiddle.net/Y2wD3/1/
[11:56:13] <BillCriswell> I think is what you want?
[11:56:52] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/Y2wD3/2/ also, don't need to wrap a jquery object with $()
[11:57:49] <duch_kazatel> also: you don't need to manually add/remove the img.  set a class on it instead that hides opr shows it.
[11:59:21] <decx> good loard that's a big loading gif
[11:59:39] <decx> i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this will need its own loading gif
[11:59:54] <BillCriswell> Hahaha, loading gif for loading.gif
[12:00:12] <BillCriswell> Loading... loading.gif
[12:00:32] <decx> i like to do it like this for loading after button presses http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Y2wD3/4/
[12:01:24] <BillCriswell> That is anice effect.
[12:01:34] <BillCriswell> I seen a bunch of them recently... of course I can never recall the url.
[12:01:45] <decx> the direct confirmation that the button is doing something is good ux
[12:02:51] <BillCriswell> http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/ found it, damn Google is fucking awesome.
[12:03:12] <BillCriswell> I really dig "zoom-out"
[12:03:19] <decx> ye hakim rocks
[12:22:04] <clarkk> can someone point out what I've done wrong with this selector, please?   Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: $('a[href=^"#"]').click(...
[12:22:35] <decx> it's ^= iirc
[12:23:05] <duch_kazatel> clarkk you might want to look into using event delegation instead of parsing through the document and binding like that.
[12:24:52] <clarkk> decx: thank you - that's correct :)
[12:25:08] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: could you elaborate on that, please?
[12:25:45] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: do you mean catch it when it bubbles up?
[12:25:49] <duch_kazatel> yup
[12:26:12] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: ok thank you - I'll investigate
[12:26:14] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be a kind of expensive operation,.
[12:26:38] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: there aren't that many links in the page, and it's only on one page
[12:27:01] <duch_kazatel> that selector is still going to be expensive.
[12:27:06] <duch_kazatel> just a thought,
[12:27:23] <clarkk> and it's a good thought - I will look into it. Thank you duch_kazatel :)
[12:27:51] <decx> $('[href=^="#"]','#parent') is pretty good
[12:29:55] <decx> =^= isnt though :o
[12:30:46] <decx> that's grumpy chinese bird
[12:42:47] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: when I append a cloned copy to retain events I get issues when I try to put my apended copy back in my lists and then back onto the drop zone, items get duplicated when I try to drag them. The only thing that has seemed to work is destroying the drag events when the item is dropped on the drop zone, and then rety draggable events when the item
[12:42:47] <Ownix> gets added back into my "shopping cart" style list
[12:43:18] <duch_kazatel> Ownix weird
[12:48:21] <clarkk> can anyone think of a way to store the two arguments of a method in a variable?  .hide('fast', 'linear').  I tried var params = ['fast', 'linear']; .hide(params), but it didn't work
[12:48:49] <duch_kazatel> the args are an array like object.

[12:56:18] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: I want to set the arguments before the method is used
[12:59:08] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: ah I think I get it. I think you can create an object and use the property names
[13:18:12] <Ownix> I am getting an error in my console, how can I see what line of my code caused this? It goes into jquery so im having a hard time tracking it down
[13:22:40] <duch_kazatel> Ownix what's the error?
[13:23:11] <Ownix> TypeError: $(...).data(...) is undefined
[13:23:14] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:
[13:23:35] <duch_kazatel> Ownix there should be a line number next to that, but check your selector to make sure it exists.
[13:23:44] <duch_kazatel> and check to make sure it really has the data you think it does.
[13:27:04] <ankurk> Hey guys, how can I get table row using index?
[13:27:34] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I do $(ui.draggable).draggable('destroy'); and the error happens in jquery in the stop event im guessing because the element has been destroyed so there is no data
[13:27:51] <duch_kazatel> sounds like it.
[13:29:45] <BillCriswell> ankurk: $('tr').eq( index )
[13:35:32] <Ownix> It looks like the stop event runs wether I hook into it or not
[13:35:52] <Ownix> but the drop event in droppable is the best place to destroy the draggable item
[13:36:06] <ankurk> Thanks BillCriswell :D
[13:36:06] <ShawnRisk> in the ticker right below the tab menu in the developing news area (shows up last so let page load fully) on this site http://cbc.ca/news uses a sorta of dissolve effort to go from one item to the next.  Is there a way to do that in jQuery?
[13:36:06] <Ownix> because I know that it has been successfully dropped in my drop zone
[13:36:44] <Ownix> ShawnRisk: maybe look into fadeout and fadein
[13:45:48] <decx> ShawnRisk check the html of that page, all the lis that hold the developing news item are position: absolute; so when one item is fading out and the other fading in they are ontop of each other
[13:46:05] <ShawnRisk> Ownix: I have looked into that and still others say that is not exactly what they have.
[13:47:32] <ShawnRisk> decx: Is this making it seem like this is dissolving or not?
[13:47:33] <Ownix> ShawnRisk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3670487/jquery-text-fade-transition-from-one-text-to-another
[13:48:02] <decx> yes because you can see the item under the active one fading in while the active one is fading out
[13:49:08] <Ownix> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/fQ2MV/850/
[13:49:44] <ShawnRisk> Ownix: thanks I will try that
[13:49:52] <ShawnRisk> decx: thanks I understand now
[13:51:17] <decx> ownix with that approach you don't get the dissolve effect
[13:51:32] <decx> where one text disolves right into the other
[13:53:43] <ShawnRisk> decx: if I wanted to use a certain number for the speed what do you think that would be?
[13:55:25] <decx> i would go with a speed of whatever
[13:55:52] <ShawnRisk> decx: okay
[14:01:11] <Ri22123> Hi, sorry I'm a total newbie. I want to make a really simple page where friends can enter a string to an input field and then a text below should change based on this input. Can someone tell me what I'm looking for? Even too stupid to find the right google term
[14:01:54] <duch_kazatel> Ri22123 you want an html input, an event listener, and .text() from jquery
[14:02:31] <duch_kazatel> Ri22123 how how is the text changing in comparison to the input?
[14:04:30] <Ri22123> duch_kazatel: thanks. The input string should be inserted in a code snippet, just as if you wanted to paste it somewhere specific
[14:04:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:04:50] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: my issue was solved by trying to get a deeper understanding of clone and how it was copying events. I am no longer destroying anything. I am confused by the helper though, what exactly is ui.helper?
[14:05:09] <Ri22123> duch_kazatel: I will search for the terms you provided. Hope I don't have to become an jquery expert to do this ^^
[14:06:26] <duch_kazatel> Ownix no clue - i don't use much jqueryui
[14:18:45] <ankurk> I want to append sorted out content after the loop (loop is sorted out), but it only appends last <td> in this jsbin, http://jsbin.com/kimijeci/1/edit. Can anyone help me?
[14:25:55] <lukey> Not in the slightest bit unrelated to jquery, but can I use CSS Media tags to set the width of an iframe width to be say, I don't know, half the width of the viewport?
[14:26:58] <lukey> I'm fairly new to CSS in general, I just have an iframe youtube embed that I kind of want to size appropriately to the device...
[14:27:10] <decx> iframe { width: 50% } *snarked
[14:28:56] <lukey> decx thanks, let's try it out...
[14:29:22] <lukey> decx: That's in my css section I know that much...
[14:29:38] <decx> i wrote that in jest
[14:29:50] <lukey> doh!
[14:29:58] <lukey> You had me there
[14:30:06] <decx> irc is hard without Kappa :(
[14:31:00] <shoky> ankurk http://jsbin.com/kimijeci/2/edit
[14:38:12] <ankurk> Shoky: Looks like my method is quite tedious.
[14:39:39] <motaka2> hello in this page the ajax result of one input goes under the other one. What should I do ?
[14:40:04] <__joshua__> any tips on disabling page drag on safari (ipad) but keeping normal scrolling of overflowed elements?
[14:40:30] <motaka2> in this page the ajax result of one input goes under the other one. What should I do ? http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/InSearch
[14:48:04] <motaka2> no one there?
[14:53:52] <__joshua__> motaka2, I don't understand you question
[14:54:18] <motaka2> __joshua__: in the frst edit box type a and wait for the results
[14:54:49] <__joshua__> ok
[14:54:51] <__joshua__> then?
[14:56:13] <__joshua__> ok, i will take a guess.  you are missing a background-color: #FFF; on .inSearchResOneOdd
[14:56:33] <motaka2> lemme see
[14:56:53] <motaka2> __joshua__: :) thx
[15:00:15] <motaka2> __joshua__: The next thing is, I doent want the form to submit when someone presses enter when the focus is on those inputs, is that possible?
[15:00:26] <pom_life> Why are 3-digit hex codes used in place of 6 digit sometimes?
[15:00:47] <__joshua__> when they are equivalent
[15:01:05] <pom_life> so FFF === FFFFFF?
[15:01:07] <__joshua__> yeah
[15:01:14] <pom_life> Okay, makes sense.
[15:01:36] <__joshua__> i always use 6 digit, but chrome dev tools will replace
[15:02:15] <pom_life> 0-9, A-F = 16 digits. 16 x 16 = 256, and RGB is 256, 256, 256. Do hex codes just represent RGB color values in base 16?
[15:03:29] <shoky> you are master of deduction
[15:04:17] <pom_life> more like a master of procrastination
[15:09:54] <motaka2> how can I stop a form to submit when someone presses enter while the focus is on an input?
[15:10:58] <duch_kazatel> prevent default, check focus, and then submit if needed.
[15:10:59] <Woet> motaka2: $("form").submit( function(event){ event.preventDefault(); } );
[15:11:04] <duch_kazatel> that breaks userflow though.
[15:11:14] <Woet> + a check where the focus is
[15:11:19] <Woet> basically what duch_kazatel said
[15:11:54] <duch_kazatel> you have to prevent default no matter what.
[15:11:59] <motaka2> Woet: that doesnt work for me, wanna see an example?
[15:12:00] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Are you familar with TeamSpeak?
[15:12:53] <Woet> motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/RBK3y/
[15:12:55] <Woet> works fine
[15:12:56] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Woet http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/InSearch
[15:13:15] <duch_kazatel> I've heard of teamspeak.
[15:13:28] <Woet> motaka2: I can assure you the code I gave you works
[15:13:38] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 i'm not going to dig through your site to help you.
[15:13:45] <duch_kazatel> pom_life why do you ask?
[15:14:04] <motaka2> Woet: I know. you are write, but I dont know why in my case it submits
[15:14:27] <Woet> motaka2: that'll be up to you to figure out
[15:14:37] <Woet> the link you gave me contains way too much irrelevant stuff for me to debug
[15:14:40] <motaka2> Woet: I am trying
[15:14:57] <motaka2> all is in InSearch.js
[15:15:38] <motaka2> Woet: and I preveted the deault in submit event, and there is just one submit event
[15:16:13] <Woet> motaka2: you changed the selector on my code right?
[15:16:25] <motaka2> no
[15:16:45] <Woet> why not?
[15:16:50] <Woet> your page has 3 forms
[15:17:02] <Woet> change the selector so it only affects the one you want
[15:17:04] <motaka2> thats rght
[15:17:23] <motaka2> Woet: I dont get you
[15:19:42] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: > http://imgur.com/eazQl8x < I would like to replicate this function in a method similar to this: > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/4RSW5/ <
[15:20:05] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure why the jsfiddle won't render the div's size correctly; it works in my normal browsers.
[15:20:37] <duch_kazatel> pom_life because your css doesn't make sense in a fiddle.  100% of what?
[15:20:47] <pom_life> of the parent container?
[15:21:19] <pom_life> What is it latching on to in a normal document?
[15:21:29] <duch_kazatel> viewport size.
[15:21:39] <duch_kazatel> either way, you want frames.  i wish I was kidding.
[15:21:45] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4846019/any-way-of-using-frames-in-html5
[15:21:55] <pom_life> I thought you were supposed to avoid frames at all costs
[15:22:52] <pom_life> I think I can work around this in jQuery
[15:22:55] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Do u get what Woet told me?
[15:23:10] <duch_kazatel> framesets are still valid in HTML5, pom_life
[15:23:20] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 probably something about your selector being back.
[15:23:22] <duch_kazatel> *bad
[15:23:26] <decx> pom_life i tried out something similar a while ago http://jsfiddle.net/decx/F2dj3/
[15:23:29] <pom_life> "Valid", sure, but isn't general consensus that they should be avoided?
[15:23:45] <duch_kazatel> sure, unless you need them.
[15:23:52] <duch_kazatel> you want frames :)
[15:24:06] <pom_life> decx: Excellent!
[15:24:09] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: so what should I do? the web says use preventDefault, but idoesn't work for me
[15:24:39] <duch_kazatel> pom_life the other option is to check out how jsfiddle does it :)
[15:24:52] <pom_life> Oh duh, of course jsfiddle does it too!
[15:24:53] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 make sure your selector is on the form element.
[15:24:57] <pom_life> Wasn't even thinking.
[15:25:36] <clarkk> I am trying to set some anchors in my page to link to their respective grandparent, but $(this) does not seem to be working. Can anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong please?   var $toggleDescAll = $('a.toggle-desc-all');    $toggleDescAll.attr('href', '#' + $(this).closest('div').att
[15:25:36] <clarkk> ('id'));
[15:25:37] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: you mean the selector for submit button ?
[15:25:41] <clarkk> ugh
[15:25:49] <clarkk> The code:    var $toggleDescAll = $('a.toggle-desc-all');    $toggleDescAll.attr('href', '#' + $(this).closest('div').attr('id'));
[15:26:10] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you want to select the form.
[15:26:56] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: you mean the selector for submit event ?
[15:27:33] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 $('form').on('submit', function(e){e.preventDefault()});
[15:27:45] <duch_kazatel> that'll get you part of the way there.
[15:27:54] <Woet> duch_kazatel: i already gave him the same coded
[15:27:55] <Woet> -d
[15:28:02] <Woet> works fine on jsfiddle, doesnt work on his site
[15:28:11] <duch_kazatel> and he's using forms?
[15:28:44] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Yes I am
[15:28:55] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[15:29:05] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: no not any
[15:29:42] <duch_kazatel> inside that function, do a console.log(e) to make sure you're actually getting something.  If so, try e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[15:33:14] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: e.stopImmediatePropagation(); doesnt work but console.log(e) gives me :  currentTarget
[15:33:14] <motaka2> 	form.inSearchFormsClassName /current...Reserve/
[15:33:29] <motaka2> which is the right target
[15:35:04] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 wait a second... how do you have your submit event listener bound?
[15:36:27] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/9061516
[15:37:19] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 .on("submit", "." + confsFin.inSearchFormsClassName, function(event) { is the handler?
[15:37:38] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes
[15:37:53] <duch_kazatel> first of all, why are you removing a binding only to re-add it?
[15:38:28] <pom_life> Okay, check it out. > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/2EcSU/ <  I have the general layout I want. The problem is, the left and right panels (green and purple) cannot fill the space they are in without causing clipping. Is there a better way to organize them?
[15:38:34] <motaka2> doublerebel: cause when I load the content in ajax more than once the event function run more than once
[15:38:52] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you're using delegation wrong.
[15:39:00] <duch_kazatel> the entire point is so you don't need to do what you're doing.
[15:39:02] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: cause when I load the content in ajax more than once the event function run more than once
[15:39:39] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 that's a sign of a deeper problem.
[15:39:42] <motaka2> ok so I remove off, cause in my test module I dont load ajax but yet I got the page submitted
[15:39:50] <duch_kazatel> this is why we use event delegation
[15:42:38] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes, as I said no change without off. I think this has something to do with line 45 where I invoke the click on a fake hidden form
[15:43:39] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 the fact that you're removing an event handler only to recreate it tells me you're doing something wrong.
[15:43:55] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I removed off
[15:44:13] <soCalled> Would it make sense for a jQuery function to return something other than "this"? I have an animation plugin that uses primitives from the web-animations js shim. Normally used like $(element).hypermatic(args); to animate, but I also want to access (currently) private functions, without applying them to any elements, and return something other than the jQuery object. (for primitive constructors of web-animations objects, not applied to a
[15:44:14] <soCalled> elements)
[15:44:16] <duch_kazatel> and, uh, if you're manually calling a click like that, then yeah....
[15:44:34] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yeah I think that is the problem
[15:44:45] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 ... then remove that line?
[15:44:53] <duch_kazatel> soCalled sure.  CSS getters are like that - they return a number
[15:45:06] <Es0teric> when sending preventing the default of a form request (i.e. going to the next page) its $('form#someId').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); right? even if the user presses "enter" on the input field?
[15:45:22] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I need that line. How can I not allow enter to find it's way there?
[15:45:35] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric no, you want .on('submit'
[15:46:00] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 use an if check?
[15:46:16] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so .on('submit' would work even if the user clicks on the submit button or presses enter, right?
[15:46:26] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: event.which gives me undefined
[15:46:38] <motaka2> so what kind of if check should I use?
[15:46:42] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yes.
[15:47:05] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 no clue.  don't have time to dump through, but you could always see what has the focus.
[15:47:30] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes I know what has focus
[15:47:40] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel alright thanks man
[15:47:41] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 and you know how to test for that?
[15:47:50] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/KevinDoughty/Hypermatic/blob/master/hypermatic.js I have $.fn.hypermatic which returns "this" but I want to make public the function hyperKeyframes, which does not operate on or return the jQuery object.
[15:47:58] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: test for what ?
[15:48:27] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 this entire exercise was because you wanted to see if the submit happened because the user hit enter within an input, right?
[15:49:36] <soCalled> How does one make private non-jQuery functions in a plugin public?
[15:50:13] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: no, I wanted the user to select among one of the ajax returned results with eneter key. that means I want eneter to be used for selection of result just like when you select something in select box with enetr ke
[15:50:20] <motaka2> key*
[15:51:23] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 okay.  then what was the issue again?
[15:51:24] <pom_life> Okay, check it out. > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/2EcSU/ <  I have the general layout I want. The problem is, the left and right panels (green and purple) cannot fill the space they are in without causing clipping. Is there a better way to organize them?
[15:51:26] <duch_kazatel> I'm way lost apparently.
[15:52:24] <motaka2> I dont want the code in submit vent get executed by hitting enter.
[15:53:12] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 if (e.keyCode !== 13){};
[15:53:27] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: lemme see
[15:53:31] <duch_kazatel> that won't work.
[15:53:32] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[15:53:33] <motaka2> e.which was undefined
[15:53:36] <duch_kazatel> because the e is the submit event
[15:53:48] <motaka2> ok
[15:55:01] <motaka2> can id do form.keypress(function(e){if(e.keyCOde===13) return false})
[15:55:26] <soCalled> Is the only way for me to make private functions public- to have them outside the plugin's scope?
[15:55:40] <duch_kazatel> soCalled basically.
[15:56:00] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 no, because that's on the keypress event.
[15:56:42] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 i don't know that you can do what you want given your constraints without adding in some other heavy lifting.
[15:56:51] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I meant to kill it before form figures out
[15:57:13] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 that won't fix your core problem.
[15:57:25] <duch_kazatel> soCalled you could alwyas craft an object in your plugin and expose methods that way.
[15:57:54] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: what do you mea?
[15:58:00] <soCalled> what do you mean?
[15:58:07] <duch_kazatel> soCalled are you using the jquery widget pattern?
[15:58:20] <duch_kazatel> if so, i'd go read the docs.
[15:58:22] <soCalled> I dunno. https://github.com/KevinDoughty/Hypermatic/blob/master/hypermatic.js
[15:58:24] <motaka2> yes my friend my solution worked!!!
[15:58:31] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 and that was?
[15:59:07] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/9061805
[15:59:08] <soCalled> It's all inside (function ( $ ) { /*...*/ }( jQuery )); // If that's what you mean
[16:00:13] <soCalled> So my only solution is to have my public functions outside of that scope.
[16:05:24] <soCalled> Oh ok, I think I understand, but a widget would still require a dom element. I was hoping somehow that my plugin itself could be the argument for the jQuery object, like var value = $(Hypermatic).myPrivateFunction(); // where Hypermatic is the name of my plugin, not a selector or dom element.
[16:05:55] <soCalled> It's alright, if I want the functions public I'll just have to make them global.
[16:08:14] <duch_kazatel> soCalled are you trying to make a jquery plugin?
[16:08:31] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[16:09:25] <tucan> I'm trying to make an app with Phonegap (and jquery) and I was wondering how I could make content scroll sideways with finger dragging?  what is this called?
[16:10:57] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Are you there?
[16:11:14] <motaka2> shoky: What about you?
[16:11:21] <motaka2> It's all done I am happy
[16:12:37] <duch_kazatel> i'm here.
[16:16:21] <LindsayMac> hello.. Just came in here to poke around and see if anyone had suggestions for scripts similar to isotope http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/layout-modes.html
[16:16:33] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: I already wrote my plugin, I just want to expose some constructor functions that return web-animations objects, not the jQuery object. Check out the examples, additive/relative/negative-delta animation is awesome! http://kxdx.org/animated-tree-menu/  http://kxdx.org/osx-dock-menu/  http://kxdx.org/negative-delta-float/
[16:16:41] <LindsayMac> i've used isotope for a long time and never really broke out to look for other similar ones and was curious if anyone was using any lighter weight options
[16:17:08] <duch_kazatel> soCalled the idea is to extend the jquery object with your function, otherwise yeah you have to do some hoisting
[16:17:40] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac maybe masonry?
[16:17:51] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  isotope is masonry+ basically
[16:17:58] <LindsayMac> they are not the same... but are used together
[16:18:11] <duch_kazatel> you asked for layout systems ;)
[16:18:17] <duch_kazatel> but that's a fair point.
[16:18:38] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: Thank you for answering. Check out the animation links, if you dare (Using Chrome or Opera)
[16:18:39] <duch_kazatel> there's also quicksand and jscraft.
[16:19:34] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  actually didn't specificaly say layout systems.. similar to isotope.. either in it's layout system or filtering capabilities
[16:19:42] <LindsayMac> but preferably both
[16:19:56] <duch_kazatel> kay
[16:20:21] <soCalled> I would like to point out that isotope animation sucks compared to http://kxdx.org/negative-delta-float/
[16:20:38] <duch_kazatel> does isotope support FF and IE?
[16:20:51] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:21:39] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac just offering some things to look at.
[16:21:40] <LindsayMac> does it support FF?
[16:21:57] <soCalled> Yeah, well, as soon as Safari devs fix my issue, right now the javascript shim needs some help.
[16:22:05] <LindsayMac> Oh quicksand isn't bad
[16:22:47] <soCalled> LindsayMac: My animation doesn't support FF well, but I'm sure whatever duch_kazatel is talking about works fine everywhere.
[16:22:48] <LindsayMac> wonder which is bulkier and which might be smoother
[16:23:11] <LindsayMac> yea..
[16:23:39] <duch_kazatel> soCalled I was more making light that depending on your use case, your animations might not work well.
[16:25:02] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: The trick is additive animation, the animations are relatively defined instead of absolutely. It's complicated. But eventually there will be native web-animations implementations that won't require the javascript shim, and will perform fine. The question is when.
[16:25:36] <duch_kazatel> soCalled sure.  for the rest of us that have to support FF and IE 8+... :)
[16:25:36] <LindsayMac> trying to figure out what this site uses
[16:25:36] <LindsayMac> http://jeremycowart.com/portfolio/groups/
[16:25:42] <LindsayMac> seems like its just some css transitions maybe
[16:26:11] <soCalled> duch_kazatel: And Safari! It's nice not having to care.
[16:26:25] <LindsayMac> ah nevermind. its using masonry
[16:26:29] <duch_kazatel> soCalled i like making money :)
[16:26:43] <soCalled> I should try that.
[16:27:29] <soCalled> The problem with Safari isn't WebKit but Core Animation, and that won't be fixed until the next major Mac OS release.
[16:44:42] <tucan> I have a feeling what I'm looking for is infinite scrolling
[16:48:14] <duch_kazatel> jsperf.com/regexp-vs-indexof/103
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> I have coworkers that use string.match()
[16:48:25] <duch_kazatel> it hurts my brain.
[16:49:15] <duch_kazatel> they use string.match('substring')
[16:57:28] <ShaunR> with the source map files, does it matter if those are provided in a production env?  I'm not wanting the client to make any additional requests for no reason.
[16:58:10] <ShaunR> I'm not really all that fermiliar with source map files, reading up on it kind of looks like only devel tools will download this file.
[17:00:16] <duch_kazatel> iirc it's a content header, right?
[17:01:57] <duch_kazatel> given my familiarity with sourcemaps, they're not downloaded unless requested by the client, ShaunR
[17:05:49] <WonderDog> sourcemaps are a separate file and typically there wouldn't be a reason to provide them to a production env
[17:12:21] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[17:16:18] <LindsayMac> gah! isotope is driving me mad
[17:42:45] <LindsayMac> I can't even figure out what the gutter width does. It seems to have NO effect on anything
[17:45:40] <jastor> XHR not doing client certificate authentication, is that something for all browsers or just Safari?
[17:46:07] <jastor> Im already authed against the server for every request, but xhr
[18:01:01] <Tomashe> hey guys , how do i delay excution of a function
[18:01:24] <Tomashe> like var x = delay.somefunction()
[18:06:03] <shoky> setTimeout
[18:09:18] <Es0teric> quick question, how do i replace every space into a + ? i am trying to do it like this: var search = $('#search').val().replace(/\s\+/g, ''); but it doesnt seem to be working
[18:10:10] <duch_kazatel> .replace(/ /g, '+');
[18:10:13] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[18:10:13] <toothrot> are you trying to quote a url?
[18:10:29] <Es0teric> toothrot no i am trying to replace all spaces with a +
[18:10:59] <toothrot> your replace() call isn't going to update the dom anyhow
[18:10:59] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel, ah there we go thanks
[18:11:05] <toothrot> er, sorry
[18:11:15] <Es0teric> toothrot i want it to update the value being past from an input field
[18:11:20] <Es0teric> *passed
[18:12:22] <toothrot> right, my mistake.
[18:19:52] <pom_life> var time = 600;            var minutes = time / 60;              How can I make it so time is rounded down if it is any decimal?
[18:20:19] <pom_life> for example, if it is 9.88889, it would display 9?
[18:26:59] <pom_life> It's just Math.floor, can't believe I forgot.
[18:30:01] <hpekdemir> hi
[18:30:10] <hpekdemir> how can I make a getJSON request when clicking on a tab?
[18:30:17] <hpekdemir> tabs from bootstrap
[18:32:28] <Kal_crunchbang> Hi there is some sort of .transision??
[18:32:35] <Kal_crunchbang> Hi there is some sort of .transition??
[18:35:49] <Jagst3r21> Hi, jQuery Waypoints (https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints) is conflicting with jQuery Color Animations and for some reason it won't work when both scripts are running. Any workaround?
[18:36:01] <Jagst3r21> jquery color is here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[18:39:02] <Kal_crunchbang> Hi there is some sort of .transition??
[18:39:15] <Kal_crunchbang> Hi is there some sort of .transition??
[19:05:29] <Loop_1> anybody feel like helping with a stubborn dropdown list on a webpage that seems like it has to be manually clicked with a mouse rather than jquery?
[19:05:41] <Loop_1> I am using autohotkey COM methods
[19:44:34] <hpekdemir> how can I make my bootstrap tabs load AJAX more than once?
[19:45:10] <hpekdemir> I made a onclick function and it loads my data (get request to another ressource). but when I click again nothing happens. the fetched data just stays the same
[19:45:13] <hpekdemir> any hints?
[19:46:29] <Davy_> Hi, i want to pass variables from an input to the Dropdown function but i can't seem to figure it out. http://pastebin.com/9KQ1ZXi8
[19:46:43] <Davy_> *dropzone
[19:47:15] <k_sze[work]> when using deferred.then
[19:47:20] <Davy_> what i get in filezilla is [object HTMLInputElement].
[19:48:00] <k_sze[work]> scratch that
[19:48:06] <k_sze[work]> when using $.when(deferreds)
[19:48:18] <k_sze[work]> how do I tell if one of the deferreds has been aborted
[19:48:39] <k_sze[work]> as opposed to an HTTP error, for example.
[19:49:03] <k_sze[work]> because I can write done and error filters
[19:49:38] <k_sze[work]> $.when(foo, bar).then(doneFilter, errorFilter)
[19:49:49] <k_sze[work]> with foo and bar being ajax requests.
[19:50:30] <k_sze[work]> How do I tell in either doneFilter or errorFilter if either foo or bar was aborted as opposed to an HTTP error happening?
[19:55:29] <Velveeta> k_sze[work]: in your error handler, your 2nd parameter is 'status', which you can compare to 'abort'
[19:55:34] <Velveeta> i *believe* that's correct
[19:55:50] <Velveeta> davy_: i need some more context around your code before i can help answer your question
[19:57:08] <Velveeta> hpekdemir: this may help you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11388074/twitter-bootstrap-reload-current-tab
[19:57:29] <Davy_> the vars defined are input values. i want to pass them to the dropzone params value. When i pass them now i get [object HTMLInputElement]. When i alert the set vars i get the correct value. When i set a string in params it passes them correctly. When i want to pass the vars it doesn't and gives me the HTML..
[19:58:00] <Velveeta> give me a line # of that paste to focus on for which vars you're talking about
[19:58:35] <Velveeta> are you talking about projecttitle and projectdescription at the top?
[19:58:46] <Davy_> line 3 and 4 need to be passed to 18 and 19
[19:59:40] <Velveeta> hm, yeah, those look like they should work just fine as-is, let me try throwing this code into jsfiddle and see if i can make it break
[19:59:54] <Davy_> this code passes but only on refresh of the page
[20:00:14] <Davy_> when i enclose line 3 and 4 in a click event, i get the http thingy
[20:05:17] <Velveeta> well, my jsfiddle tests don't seem to have any issues with recording those values in the params object, is there a url where i can see your behavior live?
[20:14:25] <jphase> Tomashe: depends on if the function is synchronous or not, but jQuery has a .delay()
[20:14:32] <jphase> oh doh!
[20:14:39] <jphase> chat was scrolled to the very top :(
[20:15:37] <Velveeta> love it when that happens :D
[20:16:53] <Loop_1> Not sure I am in the right place...but got sent here for a dropdown list on a webpage that I can't click()
[20:17:35] <Loop_1> I am just trying to make a simple selection from a dropdown list on a webpage, but it seems to need a "manual" mouseclick
[20:17:46] <Velveeta> loop_1: when you say dropdownlist, are you talking about like an asp-style DDL element?
[20:19:51] <Loop_1> velveeta: not sure how to answer.  Is there some code I might be able to review?
[20:21:14] <Loop_1> I use autohotkey to automate some tasks.  Usually, I can either use the .value := 1 or the click() but this dropdown doesn't like the .click()...it does nothing.
[20:21:18] <jphase> Loop_1: are you just trying to select an item in a <select> drop down without actually clicking it?
[20:22:29] <Loop_1> I can change the value of the list by setting it with .value ...but it doesn't actually "select" the item...it only changes the value
[20:22:40] <Velveeta> loop_1: yeah, what i'm asking is are you using a standard select? usually the only time i year people use the phrase dropdown list is when they're using an asp-style DropDownList() rendering of a select
[20:23:22] <hpekdemir> Velveeta: thanks. that helped me
[20:23:26] <jphase> Loop_1: are you using a plugin on the select element at all? Something to make it look different or act different?
[20:23:34] <Velveeta> loop_1: yeah, setting a value programmatically won't trigger anything other than the changing of the value
[20:23:48] <Velveeta> if you're trying to make it also emit a change event, you need to manually trigger that event yourself
[20:23:54] <Velveeta> hpekdemir: good to hear :)
[20:25:22] <Loop_1> here is a quick pic of the "dropdown"...it's the Division dropdown.  http://imgur.com/F1OjUui
[20:25:53] <Loop_1> What you see has the value "1" which is Circuit Civil
[20:26:17] <jphase> Loop_1: you happen to have a link for this so we can see just what type of element this is?
[20:26:26] <Loop_1> I can "inject" the value "1" and it changes it accordingly
[20:26:39] <Velveeta> i'm gonna assume it's a select, since he said he can set the .val() and it changes properly
[20:26:51] <Velveeta> i'm just curious what he's wanting aside from that, and assuming it's a change event to be triggered
[20:26:54] <Loop_1> jphase...unfortunately, it's a closed page
[20:27:07] <Velveeta> but those events don't trigger for programmatic changes of the value, only if they're legitimately changed by a user
[20:27:12] <Loop_1> Yes..velveeta I need to "trigger" the event
[20:27:46] <visua> anyone here got some SVG or heavy animation experience?
[20:27:48] <Velveeta> loop_1: then after you set the value, just do $(yourSelectElement).trigger('change')
[20:27:51] <Davy_> kudos to Velveeta, this man knows his stuff!
[20:28:08] <Velveeta> i have *some* xvg experience, but not much involving animation
[20:28:20] <visua> hrm
[20:28:40] <visua> well ill show it anyway
[20:28:58] <jphase> my animation with svgs stopped at css keyframes and jquery sprinkles on top
[20:29:12] <visua> warning, big img's
[20:29:51] <Velveeta> no problem, i have a big pipe :)
[20:30:04] <visua> or not.. dropbox is being a jerk
[20:30:35] <visua> ok, well to start. I'm working on my new portfolio site, and i have this concept of the information panel animating between slides.
[20:30:47] <visua> Basically it's a fullscreen slider, pretty simple stuff
[20:30:54] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/layout-1.jpg
[20:30:58] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/layout-2.jpg
[20:31:07] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/layout-3.jpg
[20:31:12] <visua> so those are three example slides
[20:31:29] <visua> I want that slash area containing the infomation to transition in some super rad way between them
[20:31:33] <visua> dunno how feasable that is
[20:31:39] <visua> I feel like I would need SVG+JS to do it
[20:31:56] <Velveeta> you could probably do it with css alone
[20:32:00] <jphase> yeah
[20:32:16] <Velveeta> but it depends on how you're trying to transition it
[20:32:47] <visua> I'm thinking it would be cool for the highest point to animate down as the furthest X point pushes over
[20:32:48] <jphase> visua: http://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/ with some transitions
[20:32:56] <visua> so it's almost like a fluid triangle kicking around the page
[20:33:19] <Loop_1> I just realized that autohotkey uses COM and therefore .trigger is not really available...sigh
[20:33:20] <visua> nice
[20:33:28] <visua> i've had some success using gradients with a really tight edge
[20:33:36] <visua> and then transitioning their properties
[20:33:59] <Velveeta> loop_1: if it's just an html element, and you have jquery loaded in the page, then trigger will be available, i'm not sure what you mean when you say it's using COM
[20:35:50] <Loop_1> velveeta...the truth is, I have ALOT to learn.  Autohotkey uses COM (Component Object Model) and doesn't have all of the features...like .trigger
[20:36:10] <Velveeta> visua: when you say 'kicking around the page' are you talking about having it ride the border of the page?
[20:36:20] <visua> yeah.
[20:36:21] <Loop_1> my line of code to change the value looks like this:  pwb.document.getElementByID("ctl00_ctl00_bcph_mca_courtDivisionSelectionControl_divisionList").value := 1
[20:36:27] <visua> I should probably mock it up in after effects or something
[20:36:30] <Velveeta> loop_1: so, do you have jquery loaded into the page?
[20:36:45] <Velveeta> visua: that would definitely make it easier to give you advice on how to proceed :)
[20:36:50] <visua> :)
[20:37:21] <Loop_1> No...I am actually controlling it from an external script written in AHK
[20:37:46] <Velveeta> ahhhh ok, then yeah, you're definitely in the wrong channel for that kind of guidance :D
[20:38:05] <Velveeta> you can *try* manually firing the change event on the html element itself using .onchange()
[20:38:17] <Velveeta> but you'll first want to change to make sure onchange is a value property, and is of type function
[20:38:28] <Loop_1> hold on...let me try
[20:39:26] <Loop_1> onchange is not even recognized by AHK...it errors.
[20:39:57] <Loop_1> I definitely have to work around this.  I really appreciate your help.
[20:39:58] <Velveeta> well you'd have to get a direct handle to the element itself first, like a document.getElementById(yourSelectId).onchange()
[20:40:05] <Velveeta> no problem, good luck
[20:40:36] <Loop_1> thx...
[20:40:49] <visua> this kinda works
[20:40:49] <visua> http://www.michaelnovia.net/_prototype/animation/index.html
[20:40:50] <visua> :D
[20:42:37] <visua> it's not quite as fluid as i might like, but i think it's a pretty solid technique
[20:43:06] <visua> in this way i guess I would need a way to store that gradient associated with each slide
[20:43:16] <visua> and use like data-attributes to control the styling animations
[20:43:45] <jphase> a lot of full screen sliders do that to make it easy to pick the ease-in and ease-out transitions and all that jazz
[20:43:56] <jphase> good hunting to find that example :)
[20:44:02] <Velveeta> so you could smooth that out with css transitions
[20:44:10] <visua> Well, i was thinking I could use TweenMax + some slider
[20:44:33] <visua> SuperSlides has a nice callback that I could use to control the flow of the animations
[20:45:08] <visua> once the gradient is complete then animate the information, on next() animate out the type, shift the slide and gradient etc.
[20:46:10] <jphase> if slider revolution has a stand alone non-wordpressy version, their plugin is pretty neat too. has a layer designer and you can configure infinite layers with whatever transitions you want and such
[20:46:47] <visua> lemme google
[20:47:17] <visua> interesting
[20:47:29] <jphase> yeah looks like they have a jQuery stand alone version
[20:47:40] <jphase> http://themes.themepunch.com/?theme=revolution_jq
[20:48:03] <jphase> their configs are pretty wicked and full screen comes with all the b.s. out of the box, swipey and all that jazz
[20:48:13] <visua> $12 saves me a lot of work
[20:48:53] <jphase> yeah it's worth every penny imo. I bought it recently for a project and it's already saved me a ton of time
[20:49:11] <jphase> clients like the ken burns and stuff too
[20:49:21] <visua> full screen video too
[20:50:22] <jphase> there's some stuff it doesn't advertise, like it lets you drop in fonts from google and such, it has callbacks galore with examples built in
[20:51:11] <visua> aweomse
[20:51:14] <visua> awesome*
[20:55:36] <menikmati> anyone intersted in a little work (paying)? i need to crop an image in canvas.
[21:13:54] <loktar> uhhh
[21:13:54] <loktar> I would
[21:13:54] <loktar> but Im heading to bed
[21:13:54] <loktar> http://stackoverflow.com/users/322395/loktar
[21:13:54] <loktar> ^ canvas tag is my thang :P
[21:13:55] <loktar> anyway depending on how fast you need it, like tonight vs this week you can msg me menikmati
[21:23:15] <jphase> hmm, I wonder if I should even bother using .stop in this one-page layout on the nav... it's sorta fun to spam-click a bunch of sections and watch it wig out
[21:52:36] <the8thbit> I'm trying to auto resize a div so that it's 100% of the height, minus 135 px. This is my current code:
[21:52:48] <the8thbit>  output.css( { 'height': $( window ).height() - 135 } );
[21:53:01] <the8thbit> which would work, except that none of the rest of the interface moves around in response
[21:53:07] <the8thbit> How can I convince the rest of my interface to adjust as well?
[21:54:56] <jphase> the8thbit: that depends on what the 'rest of the interface' is comprised of. hard to say without seeing those elements
[21:55:13] <the8thbit> jphase: divs
[21:55:33] <the8thbit> really its just a top div (the one I'm resizing) above a bottom div (the one that should move)
[21:55:48] <jphase> and they're both relative?
[21:56:17] <the8thbit> jphase: thanks, nevermind lol
[21:56:27] <jphase> ;]
[21:56:54] <the8thbit> I was adjusting a div inside a wrapper div, where the wrapper was relative and the inner div is absolute
[21:57:40] <the8thbit> hurray it works, thanks jphase
[21:57:45] <jphase> sure thing
[22:13:43] <zumba_addict> hi folks, i remember there is a command for displaying in log on Console in IE. It's not console.log but something closer
[22:14:23] <T13|sleeps> Console.info console.warn console.error?
[22:14:46] <T13|sleeps> Those round out the four types.
[22:14:48] <zumba_addict> no
[22:15:00] <zumba_addict> i should have taken notes of it :(
[22:15:02] <T13|sleeps> There's also a timer
[22:15:21] <zumba_addict> i'm looking for the equivalent part of console.log
[22:17:49] <zumba_addict> I tried your suggestion and it worked
[22:18:03] <zumba_addict> info, warn and error, they all worked. Even .log worked too
[22:18:10] <zumba_addict> thanks
[22:18:35] <T13|sleeps> Yep
[22:18:41] <jphase> console.log() is a function instead of a method in ie8 - if you need an ie8 work around you can prototype your own but seems a bit excessive for a browser that's dead in a month hehe
[22:19:08] <jphase> er, s/function/object
[22:19:21] <zumba_addict> k
[22:19:28] <jphase> http://hastebin.com/qelewapari.vbs
[22:19:30] <dismist> tell him to shut up
[23:15:00] <miCSu> ajax calls' success functions aren't run if browser's closed during the ajax process, right?
[23:16:41] <Uhkis> who would run them if there's no browser to run them
[23:59:08] <miCSu> Uhkis: Of course the ajax process would be launched by someone. Just thinking if it'd be possible to somehow move the processing to background so that person wouldn't have to wait on that side the whole amount of time with long processes.
