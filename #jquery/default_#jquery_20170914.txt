[01:33:29] <itsgokul> im getting error datepicker not a function why
[01:47:18] <itsgokul> im getting error datepicker not a function why
[01:53:07] <markh> itsgokul, probably not a lot of people active in here right now. the answer is that it depends. do you have a demo we can look at?
[01:57:12] <itsgokul> solved..
[02:05:43] <markh> okay.
[02:30:39] <futzhu> i want to outputting this result https://pastebin.com/raw/U9hXjfh6 one by one with delay but like progrssbar effect. replacing previous text so it look like progress. can anyone help?
[02:31:54] <Cork> futzhu: you most likey should use ajax then
[02:32:25] <Cork> and just pull it through a timer
[02:33:45] <futzhu> Cork: Thanks. any reference for me or example as i'm new to javascript pls?
[02:33:45] <Cork> something like function update() { $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { $('#progress').html(data); setTimeout(update, 500); }); }
[02:34:15] <Cork> ^ updates #progress with the content from url every half second
[02:34:47] <Cork> you need a way to store the current state cross requests though
[02:41:38] <futzhu> Cork: hmm.. i think it will showing php results at once. i need to find out "current state cross request" i think. could you pls help me with some google keyword? i'll looking for your reference as i'm not good in english and don't know what keyword meet my needs
[02:42:09] <Cork> futzhu: what will drive the crawling?
[02:42:28] <Cork> an option would be to remove the loop and have it in js
[02:42:44] <Cork> then you would make one ajax request per page you fetch
[02:43:19] <Cork> else you would have to have something doing the work independent of the browser
[02:43:44] <Cork> and it would have to store what it is currently doing so another page can fetch it and send it as a response to an ajax call
[02:45:28] <futzhu> Cork: "an option would be to remove the loop and have it in js" <-- i think this is the best solution for what i want to made. i'll looking to it
[02:45:32] <futzhu> thanks anyway
[02:46:01] <Cork> futzhu: the loop would be the update function i gave you up there ^
[02:46:10] <Cork> do NOT do a for loop in js :)
[02:46:16] <Cork> it will just bring you a world of pain
[02:46:43] <futzhu> Cork: oh i see the set time out do the loop
[02:46:58] <Cork> recursion actually
[02:47:02] <Cork> it isn't strictly a loop
[02:47:30] <Cork> the reason for that structure is that ajax is async so you have to wait for it to complete
[03:08:39] <undefined_bob> morning
[04:19:20] <ploggingdev> I was looking at how to capture events from forms with the same class. In my case the forms will be generated at runtime so it looks like I have to attach a form submit event handler to `document` as shown in this answer : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28867139/intercept-a-dynamic-added-form-submission How do I get the form element that caused the event handler to be called?
[04:40:40] <jquery586> hey there, any tips on how to do a infinitely nestable item tree? https://i.imgur.com/NcpYqpS.png
[04:41:45] <undefined_bob> jquery586: try to make a http://jsfiddle.net
[04:42:04] <jquery586> too many hooks
[04:42:10] <jquery586> i.e. css and js
[04:45:58] <jquery586> very simplified version
[04:46:00] <jquery586> https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/
[04:54:32] <jquery586> updated: https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/1/
[04:58:45] <futzhu> Cork: i was try your code it's not working when use loop in PHP https://i.imgur.com/2SoxjGQ.png but it's working good when i remove loop in php https://i.imgur.com/WCfkJGS.png the problem now it's always looping every each sec not only 10x lol. thanks btw
[04:59:50] <jquery586> undefined_bob
[05:05:31] <Cork> futzhu: ya, cause it needs a lot more
[05:05:45] <Cork> futzhu: for example i would recommend adding so the php server responds with json
[05:05:59] <Cork> and in the reponse return a new url
[05:06:09] <Cork> and that url will cause the request for the next url and so forth
[05:08:04] <futzhu> Cork: Hmm.. but that's not what i want. the purpose of this is when back-end still processing/loading for a long time, client/user get an update of what the progress of back-end. So if i out putting it as json thats mean back-end was reach end the line
[05:09:57] <Cork> futzhu: for the same url?
[05:10:17] <Cork> then you have to separate out the processing into a none browser controlled handler
[05:10:54] <Cork> or possibly hold two ajax connections to the server (one for keeping the processing alive and one for pulling data)
[05:11:20] <Cork> the solution i provided you was a solution where you instead split each processing out into its own request
[05:11:42] <Cork> meaning the for loop doesn't happen, and instead you get an update and a new ajax request for each for loop situation
[05:12:20] <Cork> unless you would provide other changes then in those situations it should be enough and a much simpler implementation
[05:13:27] <Cork> the reason i suggested that solution is cause you only echo something new for each instance of the for loop
[05:14:31] <Cork> jquery586: why not just do this in css?
[05:15:31] <Cork> also your subitem selector isn't limited to relation to the input with the change event so it will only work for one instance
[05:16:21] <jquery586> Cork how do you suggest doing that in css and how to fix that?
[05:16:43] <Cork> all you want is to show the subitem only when the checkbox is checked?
[05:18:25] <jquery586> basically if item is checked - show subitem, if it's checked show the next one, but if subitem is unchecked hide (&& disable) it
[05:19:08] <Cork> jquery586: https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/2/ ?
[05:19:49] <jquery586> this one doesn't uncheck the children
[05:20:07] <jquery586> if item is unchecked children should be unchecked as well
[05:20:17] <Cork> ah, that is easy enough to handle
[05:21:29] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/3/
[05:24:38] <jquery586> nice, but in item>subitem>subitem[...] case it breaks
[05:24:59] <Cork> use item instead of subitem
[05:25:54] <jquery586> it will make less sense (imo)
[05:33:09] <jquery586> breaks, in-context item won't hide
[05:33:25] <jquery586> subitem that is, told you makes less sense
[05:34:34] <jquery586> context: https://i.imgur.com/TmFUoRW.png
[05:38:46] <jquery586> ...and it uses this, which doesn't toggle checkboxes in an obvious way http://sierra-library.github.io/, Cork
[05:45:17] <Cork> jquery586: if you want the css to handle the class subitem you would have to add it to the selectors
[05:45:28] <Cork> i replaced it with item as i didn't see the need for subitem
[05:49:08] <jquery586> Cork, have you seen the context?
[05:49:31] <futzhu> Cork: i found the keyword in google "jquery ajax, read the stream" and comet. this is meet what i want. thanks anyway
[06:04:47] <Cork> jquery586: the point is it still works you just have to change the css selector
[06:05:56] <jquery586> not it isn't, it hides __checkbox__ not __.checkbox__ or whole .subitem/.item
[06:08:12] <jquery586> https://i.imgur.com/RlM9t7P.png
[06:10:05] <jquery586> and yes i was changing css to test it out
[06:32:02] <jquery586> ...Cork?
[06:34:16] <undefined_bob> jquery586: I think he is having lunch now
[06:39:44] <jquery586> oh, what can you say then?
[06:47:07] <undefined_bob> jquery586: that he can help you much better than I :o
[06:48:55] <jquery586> :C
[07:45:31] <voiter> how do i know what JSON.parse() is called with? https://pastebin.com/aTS8jwTS
[08:01:19] <sonu_nk> hi ,, http://projects.thedigifrog.com/index2.html this one my demo url .. here i am doing focus animation when scrolling.. but it is focus getting failed when i am scrolling with ctrl+minus and then scrolling
[08:04:45] <sonu_nk> https://pastebin.com/QhSz5Rei its my jQuery which helping me to do scroll animatin..
[08:10:59] <Cork> voiter: set a breakpoint on the prepare_request_logging line
[08:11:07] <Cork> and step from tehre
[08:11:09] <Cork> *there
[08:11:22] <Cork> cause this is in the submission, not response
[08:14:33] <jquery586> oh there you are
[08:15:02] <sonu_nk> Cork: hi there.. to scroll and focus on div i am using this script https://pastebin.com/QhSz5Rei but when i am ctrl+minus its not working. becuase i am counting scroll positition to enble focus on div
[08:15:16] <sonu_nk> what i need to look at so get solve this issue ?
[08:16:03] <Cork> sonu_nk: you will have to recalculate again ctrl+minus normally don't trigger scroll if i remember correctly
[08:16:17] <Cork> resize might though
[08:16:40] <sonu_nk> ok like what i need to read for this ?
[08:16:40] <Cork> haven't fiddled with it for a long time so not complete sure
[08:16:56] <Cork> $(window).on('resize', function() {})
[08:17:15] <sonu_nk> ok like what i need to read for this ?
[08:17:21] <sonu_nk> ok like what i need to read for this ?
[08:17:40] <sonu_nk> ok in window resize i need to add scroll script ?
[08:18:49] <jquery586> still not working, Cork
[08:19:40] <jquery586> this one does but checked on start and not being unchecked on fold https://jsfiddle.net/fab2gebs/1/
[08:20:06] <jquery586> ** not folded on load
[08:20:52] <voiter> Cork, where do i find the source code of it? xhr is a browser object just like JSON.
[08:28:05] <Cork> voiter: it is almost guaranteed that the problem is in what you send to $.ajax
[08:28:14] <Cork> i would recommend starting looking at it there
[08:28:38] <Cork> cause $.ajax and its helper functions are among the most complext parts of jquery so you can spend a lot of time there
[08:29:51] <Cork> voiter: i would also validate that what the server sends back is valid json
[08:30:57] <Cork> voiter: and to verify if it is the send data or response that is the problem is quite easy to see, if you see the request in the network tab in the browser it is the response
[08:34:57] <voiter> Cork, there is never a request made. plus: the form data is a FormData() object.
[08:35:12] <voiter> which should result in valid JSON
[08:35:25] <Cork> formData can't ever be json
[08:36:11] <Cork> to make formdata to work with ajax you need to set $.ajax({ processData: false, contentType: false })
[08:36:16] <voiter> Cork, well, firefox handles it well. chrome and opera on ubuntu don't. chrome on macosx does.
[08:36:21] <voiter> very inconsistent...
[08:36:35] <voiter> Cork, which is set, yes.
[08:36:50] <Cork> then it shouldn't normally cause that problem
[08:37:02] <Cork> JSON.parse isn't called natively in ajax with those set
[08:37:11] <voiter> i expect that the "u" token is the u of undefined
[08:37:28] <voiter> in the syntaxerror description
[08:37:35] <voiter> very confusing.
[08:37:46] <Cork> also why are you using formData?
[08:37:55] <Cork> it is only needed if you want to upload files
[08:38:31] <voiter> hm... i have to ask the author. will check with him. thanks so far.
[08:39:47] <jquery586> Cork...
[08:43:35] <voiter> Cork, doesn't matter if formdata, processData: false, contentType: false or simple javascript object and processData and contentType commented out: same syntax error
[08:44:05] <Cork> voiter: could you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle? (you can post to /echo/json)
[08:51:42] <voiter> Cork, well, yes i can: https://jsfiddle.net/851qd6v1/
[08:51:47] <voiter> here it does not fail.
[08:52:01] <voiter> do you mind trying it locally in chrome?
[08:55:02] <MassDebates> voiter:  'success'
[08:55:18] <voiter> MassDebates, in jsfiddle or chrome?
[08:55:26] <MassDebates> Google Chrome 60.0.3112.113 (Official Build) (
[08:55:36] <voiter> os?
[08:55:37] <MassDebates> Windows 7
[08:55:49] <Cork> hmm
[08:55:57] <MassDebates> voiter:  Cork is pointing you the right way.
[08:56:04] <MassDebates> This isn't normative behavior amongst all browsers.
[08:56:10] <MassDebates> Just so you know.
[08:56:20] <MassDebates> Excuse me, need to go shitpost in magento
[08:57:42] <Cork> voiter: what smells suspisiosly to me in the stacktrace you had before is at k.prepare_request_logging (<anonymous>:2:150)
[08:57:53] <Cork> that isn't normally part of the ajax request stack
[08:58:03] <voiter> huh?
[08:58:08] <Cork> https://pastebin.com/aTS8jwTS
[08:58:13] <Cork> you original pastebin
[08:58:24] <Cork> the function right before the call to JSON.parse
[08:58:42] <voiter> yes, i know. huh? as in: that surprises me immensely.
[08:59:29] <Cork> and the function name us underscore separated and that is also not normal for jquery or most other browser standard naming (it uses camelcase)
[08:59:35] <Cork> so i suspect it is a project local function
[08:59:56] <voiter> let me check that
[09:01:43] <voiter> Cork, i didn't find it in my angular.js project.
[09:03:01] <voiter> it starts to get crazy..
[09:03:10] <Cork> hmm
[09:03:20] <Cork> might it be the browsers developer tools crashing...
[09:03:31] <Cork> that would be insane...
[09:03:46] <voiter> do you mean the "F12" dev tools?
[09:03:54] <Cork> yes
[09:04:45] <voiter> hm.. on 4 different oses and same chrome versions 2 fail?
[09:05:03] <Cork> voiter: might be an extension or something like that you have loaded
[09:05:20] <Cork> voiter: the point is, what needs to happen is to find where that function comes from in your stacktrace
[09:05:31] <voiter> my chrome is a virgin. no extension, no plugin.
[09:05:33] <Cork> cause i can't debug it cause i don't have it :/
[09:06:15] <Cork> the only googling for it gives me is https://pastebin.com/ZAViYe3p
[09:06:20] <Cork> so at least you're not alone :)
[09:07:22] <voiter> that was me yesterday –.–
[09:07:29] <Cork> <_<'
[09:07:31] <Cork> ouch
[09:07:56] <voiter> well, my yesterday I and my today I share the same problem; at least.
[09:08:03] <Cork> lol
[09:08:28] <Cork> you could try opening the developer tools hit the ... and do a "search all files"
[09:08:34] <Cork> and see if you can find prepare_request_logging anywhere
[09:09:24] <voiter> well, i strongly believe that the function is nevertheless a browser function because from XMLHttpRequest.send() on it's browser internal.
[09:09:41] <voiter> frustratinig
[09:09:46] <Cork> doubt it as searching for it only results in one reference back to you
[09:10:14] <Cork> at least one so query should contain the stacktrace entry if it was something that existed in a common product
[09:10:39] <voiter> hm... just found areference to google tag manager...
[09:10:52] <Cork> ya, same here
[09:10:54] <voiter> https://www.google.ch/search?q=prepare_request_logging&client=ubuntu&hs=MUW&channel=fs&dcr=0&hl=en&sa=X&as_q&nfpr=1&spell
[09:11:06] <Cork> and the page didn't really mention the string
[09:11:07] <Cork> so...
[09:12:04] <voiter> so google pays me one day of my salary for insufficient javascript function resolving.
[09:12:47] <jquery586> Cork, __this__ but with check reset https://jsfiddle.net/fab2gebs/3/
[09:12:52] <moldy> hi
[09:12:53] <jquery586> u-g-g-g-h
[09:13:04] <jquery586> i have a big frownie rn
[09:14:37] <Cork> jquery586: why are you using the hidden class?
[09:15:04] <jquery586> because i'm __depending__ on this https://github.com/sierra-library/sierra
[09:19:39] <voiter> Cork, it must be something that is included by google tagmanager.
[09:20:06] <Cork> voiter: should be fairly easy to test
[09:20:17] <voiter> i did
[09:20:22] <Cork> just remove the script tag that includes it and see if the problem goes a...
[09:20:25] <Cork> heh... nice >_>
[09:20:38] <voiter> result is yelling at my face that it's gtm
[09:20:44] <Cork> explains why i haven't seen it, i dns block loading those scripts
[09:21:17] <voiter> i use firefox noscript. that's why login was fine for firefox but not for any browser not blocking gtm.
[09:21:20] <Cork> weird that the stack trace isn't showing up though
[09:21:21] <voiter> pretty simple.
[09:21:33] <voiter> hm... well, it's an external resource.
[09:21:39] <Cork> google tag manager is quite commonly used
[09:21:46] <Cork> i meant when googling
[09:21:54] <voiter> it's not gtm itself but what it includes.
[09:22:03] <Cork> same result
[09:22:33] <Cork> anyway, not much you can do unless you can get it to not include this specific request
[09:22:34] <voiter> could be some happy horsesh*t like woopra or so.
[09:31:39] <undefined_bob> Cork: I finnally found a solution for my menu bar problem
[09:48:30] <moldy> a user action can trigger an ajax request. i want to make sure the results of these requests are processed in the order in which the user triggered them. how should i do this?
[09:58:18] <Cork> moldy: you can't really do that
[09:58:37] <Cork> moldy: network latency different rounts and a lot of other things can cause them to end up out of order
[09:58:52] <Cork> moldy: better to keep reference so you can resync them afterwards if you need to
[10:01:15] <moldy> Cork: i am not sure what "keep reference" means here
[10:01:37] <moldy> Cork: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26735236 this would not work, because...?
[10:01:39] <Cork> it was intentionally unspecific
[10:02:17] <Cork> moldy: that one prevents you from making more then one request at at time
[10:02:21] <Cork> not handling order
[10:03:02] <Cork> or more specific if you make request 1 then if you make request 2 it will cancel request 1
[10:03:19] <Cork> it has nothing to do with ensuring the are processed in order
[10:04:27] <moldy> Cork: yeah that's what i want in this case, my question wasn't formulated well i guess
[10:39:50] <FilipNortic> how do i search for timestamp with out timezone that ends with either  '.\d\d' or '.0\d\d'
[10:40:22] <taplar> context?
[10:41:12] <taplar> cause regex wise both of those would be '.(0)?\d\d'
[10:50:19] <FilipNortic> he that was for the postgres room i didn't hit eneter on my retraction, sorry
[11:03:39] <poboy> ok, the value under "service" is a number but we echo out the name which is text.  What do I need to change so I can "copy" the service up top and "paste" it to the form on the bottom?  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/10/
[11:07:11] <codecutter> i have a global handler that sent automatically when i make a ajax call (https://pastebin.com/9sQ3sV7t), is it possible to disable it for a certain function? https://pastebin.com/9sQ3sV7t
[11:07:13] <taplar> why are you storing the text?
[11:07:19] <codecutter> that is*
[11:08:06] <taplar> $('#service option:selected').text();   <-- just change that to val()
[11:09:27] <poboy> taplar, I'm not sure how to handle the issue.  I was doing .val() and still no results.  that's when I tried .text()
[11:09:52] <taplar> cause your values for the service are different between top and bottom
[11:10:05] <taplar> which doesn't make sense for the example
[11:10:36] <poboy> oh, that was just me trying dummy data.  in the project it's the same form, same id's everything
[11:10:38] <taplar> are you saying in your real project that you have two dropdowns with the same selectable text with different values?
[11:10:43] <taplar> so yeah
[11:10:46] <taplar> fix your fiddle then
[11:11:16] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/11/
[11:11:31] <poboy> so that works, but in the project it does not
[11:11:48] <taplar> then figure out what is different
[11:11:53] <poboy> in the real project there are not two seperate forms like the fiddle.  it is one form.
[11:12:08] <taplar> i thought you said they were on different pages?
[11:12:37] <poboy> we copy the data, then the user pulls up a new version of the form and if they want they can paste the results from the last form
[11:12:49] <taplar> same page or different page?
[11:13:09] <poboy> they go back to the same page for the form
[11:13:39] <taplar> ok, well in any case, you just have to pull the data from the storage and target the right elements to put the data into
[11:14:23] <poboy> i don't understand why it's not working on the dropdown but works fine in the text and calendar fields
[11:15:15] <taplar> i'm trying to remember, i asked yesterday some point as to if the service dropdown was dynamic and i forget the answer to that
[11:16:10] <taplar> does the service dropdown always have the same options available in it on page load?
[11:16:35] <poboy> always?  no.
[11:16:54] <taplar> ?
[11:17:05] <taplar> so the available options change depending upon .... ?
[11:17:31] <d3m0n> I am trying to figure out how to detect that a file has been selected. I searched on StackOverflow and implemented an answer from there but I am missing something. Can someone take a look? https://codepen.io/jstn/pen/boNZOv?editors=1111
[11:18:24] <taplar> d3m0n: not sure that the div would get the change event.  you should try that on the file input
[11:18:34] <poboy> i'm not really sure of that.  :(
[11:19:05] <taplar> poboy: well if the option that you stored in the storage doesn't exist in the dropdown, you won't be able to paste that value
[11:19:32] <poboy> I *BELIEVE* whatever dropdown exists, when the user pulls up the form again the same options will exist (they have to change a bunch of things in order to have a different dropdown)
[11:19:48] <poboy> taplar, right, but assuming the same options exist, how could I make this work?
[11:19:51] <taplar> verify that
[11:19:55] <taplar> don't believe it
[11:20:31] <taplar> cause if you are targeting the element correctly, and it has an option in it with the value you are trying to put in it, it will work
[11:20:45] <taplar> ^ those two things are what you have to verify
[11:21:08] <taplar> 3 things if you could that you stored the value in storage correctly
[11:21:13] <taplar> r/could/count
[11:21:39] <poboy> thank you
[11:23:03] <taplar> d3m0n: yeah, the change event happens on the input when you select a file
[11:23:29] <d3m0n> Thanks taplar I didn't notice that and I changed it just to file.length and it seems to work
[11:23:53] <taplar> brb
[11:26:07] <poboy> I wonder if it's a span issue.  maybe a bootstrap thing
[11:28:11] <sine0> hello there internet folk
[11:29:08] <sine0> I am using jquery to check a checkbox with jQuery('#choice_1_3_1').attr( "checked" , true ); now this works fine, but the result does not work the same as if i actually check teh box with a mouse. there is an action that happens after its checked. whats the difference between me doing it and the jq version
[11:29:30] <taplar> logical changes do not create events
[11:29:46] <taplar> what's the event you are listening for?
[11:32:12] <sine0> well im triggering a gravity forms event
[11:32:35] <taplar> huh?
[11:32:38] <sine0> the submit button is set to conditionally appear when n happens. I chose tickbox, that will be hidden.
[11:32:47] <poboy> in the html the id is select2-courierService-container  vs courierService which is what I set it to.
[11:33:31] <sine0> Im basically hooking into a form with fields that are hidden. jquery is doing some logic, updating the hidden inputs and then they will be submitted. the user doesnt see this just hte button gets revealed
[11:34:01] <taplar> you said when you click the checkbox with your mouse, something happens, yes?
[11:34:17] <sine0> yes, the form button appears.
[11:34:24] <sine0> for submission.
[11:34:34] <taplar> so i assume some where in your logic you are binding on that checkbox and listening for click/change
[11:34:39] <sine0> imagine a 'do you agree...'
[11:34:53] <taplar> you're providing too much information, lol
[11:34:56] <sine0> no that is being done by the gravity forms (wordpress plugin)
[11:35:00] <taplar> i just need to know about the click/change
[11:35:02] <taplar> :s
[11:35:31] <taplar> ok, then if you don't know which gravity forms is listening for, you'll just have to try either one to see which one works
[11:35:51] <taplar> jQuery('#choice_1_3_1').prop('checked', true').trigger('click')
[11:36:00] <taplar> if that doesn't do it, change it t 'change' and see if it works
[11:37:31] <sine0> ok so thats not hitting it
[11:37:39] <sine0> what bit do i put to change
[11:37:43] <sine0> replace the click or the trigger
[11:37:51] <taplar> trigger('change')
[11:37:55] <sine0> rgr
[11:38:02] <taplar> trigger() creates an event of the type you give it
[11:38:55] <sine0> ok it selects the box like my orig example but still does not trigger GF
[11:39:25] <taplar> ok, so now i have to ask, are you paying for this gravity form stuff?
[11:39:57] <sine0> of course its not free. but im not going to get support ticket for this its out of scope.
[11:40:00] <taplar> because if so, at this point i would want to advise you to request help from them directly https://www.gravityhelp.com/support/
[11:40:25] <sine0> but thanks for your time.
[11:43:17] <sine0> I cant see how it differs from the real event of clicking or checking hte box
[11:43:50] <taplar> the browser treats it differently
[11:44:03] <taplar> a real user generated event has more weight than a logically created one
[11:44:19] <taplar> for security reasons
[11:45:16] <taplar> but it may be that GF is doing something differently than listening for those two events.  I dunno.
[11:47:09] <taplar> do you have a working example of the form that you can share?
[11:53:21] <sine0> yes
[11:53:43] <sine0> its on my testing ground site, but the select box is just a poc thing at the moment.
[11:54:51] * sine0 taplar https://limesglass.co.uk/balustrade-quote/
[12:45:38] <hellyeah> anyone used highlight.js https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/dce2L6kx/1/ i didnt see any highlight here?
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/dRAZjeJ.png works fine here.
[12:50:51] <hellyeah> i did it
[12:57:53] <MikeD_1> $.event.special.destroyed = { remove: function(o){ /* etc */ } }    does this line overwrite an existing object or is it safe enough to call blindly like this?
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j6kfxbcs/1/
[12:59:11] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_1
[12:59:23] <robertmaxrees> however.
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j6kfxbcs/2/
[13:00:28] <MikeD_1> so it IS stompy
[13:01:00] <MikeD_1> hmmm, no
[13:03:26] <poboy> I will stab select2
[13:03:27] <tsglove> Can I have a $.get    nested under a   $("#id").change(function() {    ??
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> tsglove sure.
[13:03:44] <tsglove> I'm trying to get it working, yet... it's not performing the get
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> tsglove well
[13:03:58] <robertmaxrees> tsglove do you have multiple elements with that ID?
[13:04:20] <tsglove> If I test the .get with a button    .click(function){   it works fine
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:04:39] <tsglove> robertmaxrees, just one... ahh.  well, multiple elements... yet sir
[13:04:47] <tsglove> *yes
[13:04:54] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="id"]').length)
[13:04:58] <tsglove> I want (if possible), to make a .get  when a dropdown option changes
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause issues.
[13:05:08] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> but you can do whjat you want.
[13:05:35] <tsglove> Ok, I'm not much experience with jquery... so... trying to get my feel around.
[13:05:54] <robertmaxrees> duplicate IDs are invalid html :)
[13:06:18] <robertmaxrees> so start by fixing that.
[13:06:37] <tsglove> I mean, the dropdown has one ID,   yet each <option>  of the dropdown does not have an ID
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> do other elements have the same ID as that select?
[13:07:48] <tsglove> No... I just did a search. (it's a small page)
[13:08:12] <tsglove> Only the <select id="deptDropdown">      exists.   No other  deptDropdown   anywhere else.
[13:08:12] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing you code in a fiddle then?
[13:08:21] <tsglove> Sure... lemme clean it up.  On my way
[13:10:11] <tsglove> robertmaxrees, I placed it here--> http://paste.ubuntu.com/25535107/       I opened up jsfiddle... yet...
[13:10:39] <tsglove> line 7  is the one I'm trying to fire on the dropdown change
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> and the button click works?
[13:11:10] <tsglove> Yes!   I don't get it
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> can you add in actual markup for those dropdowns?
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> instead of the PHP?
[13:12:32] <tsglove> Yes... doing that now.
[13:12:39] <tsglove> btw, thanks for the help... much appreciated!
[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> btw var $deptValue = $("#deptDropdown").prop("value"); should just use .val()
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> also: console.log($('[id="deptDropdown"]').length); add this right before that .change() binding.
[13:15:38] <robertmaxrees> then pop open your console and see what you get.
[13:15:46] <tsglove> ahh... ok... lemme see...
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> (by "console" i mean your browser's dev tools)
[13:17:34] <tsglove> the console.log($('[id="deptDropdown"]').length);    returned 1
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:17:40] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> so try this.
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> go to the network tab of your dev tools.
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> then change the dropdown.
[13:18:21] <tsglove> ahh ok... lemme see
[13:18:40] <tsglove> Nothing... no new requests or anything
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> even ones that are seemingly unrelated.
[13:19:28] <tsglove> uff yes... lemme see
[13:19:52] <tsglove> I added the bootstrap libraries, yet did a wget locally... and I don't know if that has to do with this.... yet it's chock full of errors
[13:19:54] <tsglove> =\
[13:19:57] <tsglove> lemme see...
[13:20:06] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:20:15] <robertmaxrees> errors can break all kinds of things.
[13:21:04] <tsglove> yeah... let me see if I can fix these, and then narrow down the issue
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> what kinds of errors are there?
[13:23:14] <tsglove> TypeError: $.get is not a function
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> tsglove well
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:24:44] <taplar> what jQuery file are you including on the page?
[13:25:16] <tsglove> The ones I got from bootstrap4 page, --> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:25:23] <taplar> 'slim'
[13:25:25] <taplar> there it is
[13:25:25] <tsglove> So..... .get doesn't exist there?
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> that's why
[13:25:30] <tsglove> lol
[13:25:31] <tsglove> damn
[13:25:32] <tsglove> ok
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> slim doesn't have ajax
[13:25:48] <tsglove> damn slim... now I need to get the full one
[13:25:49] <tsglove> np
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> where'd you get that info for slim?
[13:26:10] <tsglove> I believe from the bootstrap4 page itself... let me see if I can fetch the link
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> and you can get a "real" version from jquery.com/download/
[13:26:39] <tsglove> here http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:26:54] <tsglove> Ok, I'm going to jquery.com now... just didn't know.  This is all relatively new to me
[13:27:43] <taplar> that's kinda sucky
[13:28:42] <taplar> i'd think it'd be a better approach to have the full version on their page, rather than the slim, and then leave it up to the users to be smart enough to decide if they want to use slim or not.  rather than default to slim and have others bite one
[13:29:12] <tsglove> lmao
[13:29:18] <tsglove> haha now it's working perfectly
[13:29:19] <taplar> i mean seriously
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> people complain about bloat and pressure projects to do stuff like that.
[13:29:37] <robertmaxrees> hell there are tons of people that'll rag on you for using jquery at all.
[13:29:41] <tsglove> thanks robertmaxrees and taplar .   Much appreciated your help. =)
[13:29:42] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of sad.
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> also: people will download both versions and include them./
[13:29:57] <taplar> lol
[14:01:12] <Guest68787> Hi everyone! I'm new to web development and have a small task, I have a json file which I have to read in a jqgrid and display it in a grid in a static html web page, can anyone help as to how to proceed about this? I have followed this http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html , but it is taking data from a url when I have a file in my system and not a URL. can anyone help? TIA
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> Guest68787 are you running a local dev server?
[14:02:51] <Guest68787> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:03:00] <robertmaxrees> Guest21713 then just serve the file up through that.
[14:03:08] <robertmaxrees> same instructions otherwise.
[14:03:47] <Guest68787> robertmaxrees: you mean give the path to the json in url?
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:04:53] <Guest68787> robertmaxrees: thanks
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[15:41:03] <printForever> Gooood Monday morning! :)
[15:41:18] <printForever> it's actually Thursday close to 10PM
[15:41:23] <printForever> anyway
[15:41:34] <robertmaxrees> haha
[15:41:47] <printForever> is there a way to do ajax request with JavaScript vanilla?
[15:41:57] <printForever> hey robertmaxrees :)
[15:42:14] <taplar> seeing as how jQuery is just a wrapper around vanilla js, :)
[15:42:16] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of ways.
[15:42:30] <printForever> hey taplar :)
[15:42:34] <taplar> yo
[15:42:35] <printForever> hm...
[15:42:43] <robertmaxrees> (by lots I mean 2 - 3 if you wanna include JSONP)
[15:42:54] <robertmaxrees> ((which isn't technically ajax))
[15:42:55] <printForever> I've seen that there is a open() and send() but I'm not sure its the best solution
[15:43:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:43:20] <printForever> yeah...
[15:43:23] <printForever> sec
[15:43:23] <robertmaxrees> window.open()?
[15:43:30] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started
[15:43:47] <printForever> this https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_xmlhttprequest_send.asp
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[15:44:00] <robertmaxrees> 1: avoid w3schools and use mdn.
[15:44:00] <printForever> well... that is send/open
[15:44:11] <printForever> MDN is boring and it takes ages to get to a point
[15:44:21] <printForever> also Mozilla renamed it
[15:44:30] <printForever> and Mozilla killed Firebug
[15:44:33] <taplar> all that relevant information about your question.  who has time for that?
[15:44:35] <robertmaxrees> but also includes salient information and is generally correct.
[15:44:36] <printForever> and we hate Mozilla, right?
[15:44:40] <robertmaxrees> printForever wat
[15:44:54] <printForever> not arguing that
[15:45:04] <printForever> just kidding
[15:45:09] <robertmaxrees> firefox rolled core firebug integration into the browser and now firebug is a collection of pluings.
[15:45:16] <robertmaxrees> 2: if you're not using jquery, just include a polyfill for the fetch api and use that.
[15:45:27] <robertmaxrees> 3: short of those, use XMLHttpRequest.
[15:45:34] <printForever> thats the stuff
[15:45:45] <printForever> 3. is for me
[15:46:05] <printForever> I've built this
[15:46:05] <printForever> http://plumts.com/preview/itunes/
[15:46:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:46:10] <printForever> its just for a demo
[15:46:17] <printForever> but if you look at the code
[15:46:18] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:46:26] <printForever> you will see that JSON is in setTimeout :D :D :D
[15:46:33] <printForever> instead of waiting for the ajax to complete
[15:46:39] <printForever> I've set a fixed timeout
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> wait you're using jquery tho.
[15:46:47] <printForever> yes but I'm learning JS
[15:46:52] <printForever> all over again
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS js.
[15:46:57] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[15:47:02] <printForever> so I wanted to do it pure vanilla
[15:47:18] <robertmaxrees> 2 things then.
[15:47:27] <robertmaxrees> 1: you don't need a settimeout in that callback.
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> you're already waiting for the data to be there.
[15:47:39] <printForever> and when I'm done with 3 more sprints I will move to ReactJS, and then to Redux
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> 2: i'd ask in ##javascript if you have questions about native implementation.
[15:48:10] <printForever> 2: I feel more at home asking here :)
[15:48:11] <taplar> doesn't react have it's own http implementation?
[15:48:23] <taplar> i know vue does
[15:48:25] <printForever> taplar, via modules
[15:48:26] <robertmaxrees> printForever doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[15:48:51] <taplar> so if that is the intended framework, why not jump straight to that?
[15:49:07] <printForever> 1: well, I'm not sure I get that. If the function is ran without a timeout and there is no JSON on the other side because of the server waiting, there is an error
[15:49:23] <printForever> the basics are important
[15:49:30] <robertmaxrees> printForever then your callback needs to be refined.
[15:49:36] <printForever> thats right
[15:49:41] <printForever> thats what I'm doing right now
[15:49:44] <robertmaxrees> but the timeout is literally waiting after it's responded.
[15:49:52] <printForever> oh?
[15:49:55] <robertmaxrees> like, that doesn't fire until after the call is don't.
[15:50:00] <robertmaxrees> *done
[15:50:05] <robertmaxrees> that callback fires on success.
[15:50:11] <printForever> but... the response for the call can be...
[15:50:13] <taplar> heh
[15:50:13] <printForever> really?
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> so it's already done waiting.
[15:50:27] <robertmaxrees> the response can be something you don't suspect.
[15:50:34] <printForever> oh... do I feel...
[15:50:34] <robertmaxrees> but using a timeout doesn't change that part.
[15:50:47] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[15:50:50] <printForever> ok
[15:50:54] <robertmaxrees> that's the success callback.
[15:52:37] <printForever> wait....
[15:52:54] <printForever> so, you're saying that now I already am waiting for the json?
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:53:08] <robertmaxrees> plus 2500ms
[15:53:29] <printForever> oh man
[15:53:36] <printForever> I have to test that out
[15:53:49] <printForever> but if there is no timeout I wont see the animation that I worked hard on :D
[15:54:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:54:11] <printForever> did you open the page?
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not forcing people to watch a 2.5 second long animation, right?
[15:54:22] <printForever> I would like to, yes :)
[15:54:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[15:54:31] <taplar> i would like to boycott your site
[15:54:32] <printForever> its for a demo
[15:54:35] <printForever> not for production :)
[15:54:42] <printForever> its for l3arning
[15:54:46] <robertmaxrees> so you want your demo to look slow and clunky?
[15:54:46] <printForever> :)
[15:54:48] <taplar> that's not learning
[15:54:51] <printForever> hahaha
[15:54:57] <printForever> I get, I get it
[15:55:06] <taplar> side note, you have mixed usages of triggerButtonSpan.method and $(triggerButtonSpan).method
[15:55:10] <printForever> I just wanted to show of my UI skills
[15:55:11] <taplar> you only need the former
[15:55:27] <robertmaxrees> printForever good UI skills mean understanding good UI.
[15:55:27] <printForever> how come?
[15:55:33] <taplar> it's already a jQuery object
[15:55:36] <robertmaxrees> forcing people to wait for 2.5 seconds is bad UI
[15:56:11] <taplar> $(jqueryobject) is unnecessary
[15:56:15] <printForever> robertmaxrees: I agree, what I did there was to demonstrate a spinner icon and how it would look on slow 3G network
[15:56:28] <robertmaxrees> printForever for a demo, right?
[15:56:33] <printForever> taplar: I realized that, so somewhere I removed that
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use the 3g network simulation in chrome.
[15:56:46] <printForever> yes, I wanted to show that I was thinking about that
[15:56:47] <printForever> yes
[15:56:53] <printForever> and 5x slower CPU rendering
[15:57:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> you can simulate all that.
[15:57:11] <printForever> iKnow :)
[15:57:17] <printForever> but this was "easier"
[15:57:28] <printForever> and I also didn't know that I was setting the timeout on the success
[15:57:31] <taplar> toggling a dropdown is harder?
[15:57:38] <robertmaxrees> eh
[15:57:45] <robertmaxrees> what else would that callback be for?
[16:04:55] <taplar> lots of near global variables in this guy
[16:06:07] <taplar> i feel like a few of those could be scoped down more
[16:14:12] <printForever> I will fix up the code
[16:14:27] <printForever> oh I just realized, the version I gave you
[16:14:41] <printForever> I already fixed the mixed usages
[16:14:45] <printForever> I realized that early on
[16:19:14] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:19:35] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:19:51] <gambl0re> hi, can i pm you?
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> nah.  you can ask the channel tho!
[16:20:23] <robertmaxrees> That's why it's here :)
[16:20:42] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re there's no need to PM me duder :)
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> there's a whole channel here with people that'll help!
[16:22:29] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:48:03] <printForever> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:11:09] <adavia> Maybe this is the wrong channel but is this an issue with the bootstrap library? https://jsfiddle.net/vscotLab/1/
[23:22:35] <d3m0n> Anyone mind telling me how one would access/use API in jquery plugin? http://scottcheng.github.io/cropit/#docs-apis
[23:22:59] <d3m0n> $imageCropper being the element I am selecting ?
