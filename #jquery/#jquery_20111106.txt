[00:27:45] <Whirl3d> how do you make an empty jquery collection to .add elements to?
[00:29:21] <Whirl3d> aghouseh, what are you trying to iterate through?
[00:30:40] <Whirl3d> It's Saturday night....usually this place is jumpin' LOL Where is everyone?
[00:53:51] <handyman> Can someone help me?  I'm using datatable plugin
[00:53:53] <handyman> http://pastie.org/2819164
[00:57:34] <handyman> sulo do you speak english?
[00:57:48] <handyman> sulo,
[00:57:50] <sulo> yes
[00:57:53] <sulo> why?
[00:58:09] <handyman> I am having trouble with a script and I need help
[00:58:12] <handyman> http://pastie.org/2819164
[00:58:28] <handyman> nobody else is awake
[01:00:35] <sulo> hmm.. i'm not very good at jquery but
[01:00:49] <sulo> why does myrow.remove() not work?
[01:03:34] <Lundy> what is wrong with it
[01:04:21] <handyman> sulo, we are trying to use the plugin's delete function which is supposed to work the same as remove() because the data is stored in memory and so we are limited to the plugin's functions
[01:04:59] <handyman> Lundy, it will delete a row but it is not deleting the correct row http://pastie.org/2819164
[01:05:04] <sulo> handyman: sorry but i don't know anything about that 'plugin'
[01:05:22] <Eviltwin> handyman: Put "var " in front of myrow, and emailId
[01:05:23] <handyman> sulo, thanks anyways for taking a look
[01:05:29] <Eviltwin> var myrow = $(this).pare...
[01:05:35] <Eviltwin> var emailId = $(this).attr(...
[01:05:38] <Eviltwin> And try again
[01:05:45] <handyman> ok will give that a go
[01:05:48] <handyman> thanks
[01:06:49] <sulo> ehm.. and an other question.. would the parents call delete all tr's if this table is nested in an other table?
[01:06:56] <sulo> since it goes up to <html>
[01:07:00] <Eviltwin> Yes, he wants .parent() instead
[01:07:03] <sulo> if i read the docs right
[01:07:28] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[01:07:32] <Eviltwin> .closest()
[01:07:33] <sulo> more likely partent().parent() ;-)
[01:07:36] <sulo> ^^
[01:07:43] <Eviltwin> ?.closest
[01:07:43] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:07:53] <sulo> or that ^^
[01:08:22] <handyman> I think that solves it.  Thanks Evil
[01:08:34] <Eviltwin> I figured it would
[01:08:41] <sulo> the var or the closest?
[01:08:45] <Eviltwin> The var
[01:08:50] <handyman> closest
[01:09:03] <handyman> the var didnt work
[01:09:10] <Eviltwin> So you didn't do the var at all?
[01:09:19] <sulo> :-P
[01:09:23] <handyman> tried using var
[01:09:26] <sulo> without var its global variables isn't it?
[01:09:28] <Eviltwin> Yes
[01:09:39] <Eviltwin> So it'll break in other places
[01:09:47] <Eviltwin> Try deleting two emails in rapid succession
[01:10:09] <Eviltwin> Either way, they're both things I suggested :P
[01:10:12] <handyman> will also take a look at that.  thank you
[01:10:35] <sulo> eh .. i mentioned the parents thing ;-)
[01:10:49] <sulo> you just provided the solution ^^
[01:14:40] <handyman> okay so neither of those worked.
[01:15:16] <handyman> just to confirm.... when I tyype $(this) i'm referencing the link that the handler is attached to
[01:16:31] <sulo> this is the element clicked
[01:16:44] <sulo> in your case the link klicked
[01:17:44] <handyman> Then it should be working...
[01:18:31] <handyman> Eviltwin: Do you have any other ideas?
[01:19:10] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a jsFiddle is?
[01:20:06] <handyman> i dont
[01:21:00] <handyman> is that what the devil went down to georgia to play?
[01:21:20] <Eviltwin> ?jsFiddle @ handyman

[01:21:51] <handyman> excellent.  thanks
[01:28:13] <and7ey> hi all! I am trying to create jquery combobox with remote source. I've almost done, but it doesn't return correct .val() - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8025867/how-to-get-combobox-value-at-select-function. Could you please help me with this?
[01:31:59] <Eviltwin> handyman: http://jsfiddle.net/kkabC/
[01:33:21] <Eviltwin> and7ey: Look at the Events on http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[01:33:58] <and7ey> Eviltwin: which event should I look at?
[01:34:05] <MACscr> Ok, so lets say i have <button>Start</button> and on click, i want to toggle it to Pause and vice versa. I know how to do click(), but im not 100% sure how to toggle Start. I know how to do attr(), but not whats between a start and end element. Thoughts?
[01:38:26] <anvandare> what does start link to, a continuous state or a trigger?
[01:39:10] <anvandare> for appearance, you can do $("#startButton").addClass("paused");
[01:39:37] <anvandare> or even toggleClass
[01:40:04] <MACscr> anvandare: its for a timer im doing. Im not trying to change the class, thats easy. Im trying to change the actual text from Start to Pause and vice versa
[01:40:23] <mahal> hi all
[01:40:28] <mahal> good morning in CET timezone
[01:41:36] <anvandare> oh
[01:41:53] <anvandare> in that case, what kind of button is it? a div you've styled, or an original html input button?
[01:42:28] <MACscr> <button>Start</button>
[01:42:33] <MACscr> just like i had mentioned =P
[01:43:14] <anvandare> I'd go with $("#myButton").attr("value", "Paused"); then :P
[01:43:34] <MACscr> but there isnt an attribute called value, right?
[01:43:35] <anvandare> ah no, wait, i see
[01:43:40] <anvandare> button is a container type
[01:43:40] <mahal> I am trying to implement jqueryui. I have created index.php file where i have defined the function as described in example. Problem that i have is when calling other PHP script through XMLHttp request and i want to display result of that script in specified DIV. that is clear so far i hope.
[01:43:49] <anvandare> $("#myButton").html("Paused");
[01:43:56] <MACscr> ah, yes, html, that was it
[01:43:58] <MACscr> thanks!
[01:44:00] <anvandare> np
[01:44:04] <mahal> Problem i have is that in that called script i do not have jqueryui features
[01:46:03] <anvandare> mahal: i'm not sure what you mean, are you talking about ajax requests?
[01:46:16] <mahal> avandare: yes i am
[01:47:02] <anvandare> in that case, send a callback function along with your request
[01:47:03] <anvandare> ?get
[01:47:04] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[01:47:08] <dub54> Hi, trying to make an ajax request when a form is submitted, and then carry on with once the request is complete, but the request fires but doesn't proceed to the form action.. http://pastebin.com/1i7zuRwD
[01:47:10] <anvandare> hmm, not that one
[01:47:33] <anvandare> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[01:47:51] <mahal> avandare: yes GET method.
[01:48:08] <handyman> thanks again for all the help.  sulo you had it.  Evil that example you provided saved me from pulling out whats left of my hair
[01:48:25] <mahal> avandare: okay i'll check that again. Do i need to download jquery if i downloaded and used jqueryui ?
[01:48:49] <mahal> avandare: sorry for these lame questions, but i got so confused last night :/
[01:49:00] <anvandare> mahal: yes, ui is on top of jquery
[01:49:27] <mahal> avandare: Okay im dumb :) I am going to check it now Thank you
[01:50:24] <handyman> Eviltwin: That was perfect.  Worked like acharm... Thanks
[01:50:56] <anvandare> dub54: i could be mistaken, but i don't think functions bound to submit receive arguments
[01:51:44] <anvandare> ah wait, no, it gets an eventobject
[01:53:32] <megfrisch> hiyo, any ninjas available who know masonry well enough willing to lend a helping earhand?
[01:53:46] <megfrisch> have a puzzle
[01:54:03] <MACscr> ask the actual question
[01:54:15] <MACscr> just a sec, masonry?
[01:54:43] <asdf`> (as in freemasons)
[01:54:59] <megfrisch> masonry is working well but my objects are large and can get 2x sometimes per viewport width but largely consists of singular items and the rare pair and rarer 3x.. so huge gaps if its say tallish portrait aspect obj followed by wideish landscape aspect
[01:55:31] <megfrisch> so i want to detect the potential for the gap & if th enext object can fit up there w/ a tolerance b/w its full width (if landscape) down to about 70  max
[01:55:42] <megfrisch> then allow a certain amount of overlap
[01:56:00] <megfrisch> also if its portrait the full height
[01:56:12] <megfrisch> down to about 70% and allow up to say 3-6% overlap of objects
[01:56:35] <megfrisch> so its going to feel like yr roughly lining up these objects in the grid, casual encounters & all that ..
[01:56:55] <megfrisch> need to alllow a certain amt of liquidity and irregularity b/w objs oK
[01:57:12] <megfrisch> so if gtter here is 2% overlap at top but overlaps other object at 6% is OK
[01:57:25] <megfrisch> also interested in smushing up all gaps so there's some kind of centrifugal force
[01:57:27] <megfrisch> if that makes sense??
[01:57:31] <megfrisch> everything comes together
[01:57:37] <megfrisch> tighter & less bric
[01:57:37] <megfrisch> k
[01:58:29] <megfrisch> like if you put a vacuum at the middle of my layout. pulled everything in to radial centr
[01:58:34] <megfrisch> 'cinch' effect
[01:59:09] <megfrisch> so objective 1 is extend masonry to detect possible outliers bricks who could fit up in a gap if resized and resize them
[01:59:12] <megfrisch> if that makes sense
[01:59:15] <megfrisch> and object ive 2 is
[01:59:35] <megfrisch> pull everything in a bit closer together, overlapping with some consistency
[01:59:54] <megfrisch> but minding *certain* gaps who fall outside the logic mentioned  above
[01:00:31] <megfrisch> & leaving them be so is more naturalistic w/ radial gravitational smushing cinching objects that exists on top of masonr's brickyness
[01:01:32] <megfrisch> ...
[01:01:45] <megfrisch> maybe examle would help?
[01:02:12] <megfrisch> if anyone's listening out ther. is it daylight savings any crickets know?
[01:04:13] <megfrisch> have a look at very basic draft here , simple simple implementation of masonry
[01:04:14] <megfrisch> http://goodshop.pe/dev/
[01:05:07] <megfrisch> but you see the nature of the objects is to be large and less you're using a hugeish monitor yr gonna see lot of gaps like so http://cl.ly/023O3L0J2F2E1f0X1U1j
[01:05:30] <megfrisch> the next object after this lady tho is landscapeish and could possibly get resized to squinch up in that gap
[01:07:07] <megfrisch> but so with some logic
[01:07:22] <megfrisch> since we can resize a bit if it suits and overlap some code like this gets applied
[01:07:22] <megfrisch> *  i can let them overlap a bit,
[01:07:36] <megfrisch> http://cl.ly/2G052v410F35203q3i1d
[01:08:13] <dub54> anvandare: should my code work then or ?
[01:08:29] <anvandare> eh?
[01:08:49] <anvandare> oh hang on, i was gonna run it with firebug to see what it gets
[01:08:59] <dub54> ah cool
[01:09:38] <megfrisch> so i suppose i'm looking for anyone willing to lend some effort at logic around this puzzle  - not much of a programmer myself, but i can pseudo code the rules . interested in how / if i should be extending masonry with some layout method, or if i should just write my own function for after the images themselves have loaded
[01:11:11] <MACscr> megfrisch: id ask in a forum. This channel really isnt for third party plugin support
[01:11:36] <MACscr> plus your issue is quite specific
[01:12:29] <megfrisch> MACscr: thanks!
[01:12:48] <anvandare> ah, i see
[01:12:56] <anvandare> dub54: what are you assigning the .submit function to again?
[01:13:01] <MACscr> megfrisch: also note that you probably dont have the legal rights to most of those photos your posting on your site
[01:13:04] <MACscr> so be aware
[01:13:52] <dub54> anvandare: my form
[01:14:31] <anvandare> well, the point is, you don't get the "ajaxCompleted"
[01:14:34] <anvandare> you only get the event
[01:14:39] <anvandare> so ajaxCompleted will be undefined
[01:14:41] <anvandare> and thus, not true
[01:14:54] <anvandare> leaving only the 'else' branch available
[01:14:58] <anvandare> so it'll always fail :P
[01:15:33] <megfrisch> MACscr: thanks, the images are from a client of mine, we'll have some terms or privacy once we're live
[01:15:55] <dub54> anvandare: if I put an alert in the if(ajaxCompleted) it fires
[01:16:56] <anvandare> o_O
[01:18:33] <anvandare> nope, my submit() only passes 1 argument to the function
[01:18:48] <MACscr> megfrisch: so your making a site for someone that is paying you, yet your not a programmer? Also, what does Terms have to do with posting an image you dont have the right to use? Just because you state that your not affiliated with them or own rights to it, doesnt mean you can legally use them
[01:19:08] <MACscr> ignorance of the law is not an excuse
[01:19:21] <anvandare> dub54: what exactly is ajaxCompleted? is it a flag?
[01:20:21] <megfrisch> MACScr: I'm designer / site builder / hacker, i don't call myself a programmer like a hobby painter wouldn't call themselves a fine artist
[01:20:28] <dub54> not 100%, i had this snippet saved, i'm guessing it's the $form.trigger("submit", [true]); true value ?
[01:20:42] <megfrisch> MACScr: i write code...
[01:21:06] <anvandare> yeah, that one bugs me too
[01:21:18] <anvandare> it seems to spin off into an infinite submission loop :P
[01:21:24] <MACscr> right, but a hobby painter wouldnt be having people pay them to make something either =P
[01:21:33] <MACscr> er, paint something
[01:21:36] <dub54> anvandare: yeah, if i set true to false it continuously calls the ajax request
[01:22:20] <megfrisch> MACScr: but perhaps they'd pay them to sketch something out, rough out the form, and hire an expert consultant w/ in budget to add that value
[01:23:10] <MACscr> nope. Because once your being paid, its not a hobby, its a business
[01:23:26] <megfrisch> exactly, i'm not asking her to pay me as a programmer, though
[01:23:42] <megfrisch> she's paying me as her designer, site builder, realizer.
[01:23:57] <megfrisch> client is paying me to guide her from concept, brand i dentity, to complete form , help her take an idea which is purely conceptual , visualize and add interactive layer, and refine as needed given budget
[01:25:34] <megfrisch> not about wasting time arguing, if you're offering some help i'm curious about your thoughts about the licencing, plan was just to link to original sources and add some clause about we're not trying to claim we own the rights yadda yadda. just fleshing out form at th emoment, have time to clear up foggy bigger picture as we go along
[01:25:52] <MACscr> you cant legally do that
[01:26:36] <MACscr> just like you cant put an rss feed on a site from 99% of news sources without a license agreement
[01:27:43] <megfrisch> and what do you know that we can legally do? i know that this is not legal reproduction but its also sole purpose is as inspiration stream for her visual vocab and design pattern exercise. not meant to be bought sold, commercially distributed. there is a store front component that is coming and will be primary focus. the photo blog is just an affect
[01:28:05] <molavy> why this code return error on terrible  IE, $(this).trigger({ type : 'keypress', which : 13 });
[01:28:10] <megfrisch> we w illl say 'if u want us to take it down let us know.' its a pacified statemnt
[01:28:28] <megfrisch> for the catchall and otherwise we'll explicitly state whatevers,
[01:28:37] <MACscr> thats like saying after you pirate software that you will stop using it if caught
[01:29:18] <megfrisch> yes and so its a matter of my client's conservativisme ? she's no punk but she's also not Not going to tell you she's a renegade if u ask
[01:29:28] <MACscr> you cant have "inspirational" images unless people submit them and give away the rights for you to do it
[01:29:31] <megfrisch> her choice to share imgs w/ her circle
[01:29:41] <megfrisch> her choice to take the hit if shehas to
[01:29:49] <megfrisch> 'artistic' artistic licensing
[01:29:52] <megfrisch> dunno
[01:30:16] <megfrisch> afk / sec
[01:30:19] <MACscr> whatever. rationalize it all you want. its wrong. As a consultant myself, i would advice my client that its not legal and that i cant do it
[01:30:31] <MACscr> er, advise
[01:30:36] <anvandare> hmm
[01:31:11] <molavy> any idea?
[01:38:23] <MACscr> or that permission from item owners has to be received prior to each item being on the site
[01:42:15] <megfrisch> do appreciate yr commentary, and admittedly am rationalizing but theres photoblog / inspo legacy which is primary pattern we're desiging for , what do you make of ffffound jjjound other photoblogs & the like,
[01:46:16] <MACscr> if they are submitted by users, they can claim some lack of responsibility as they have no control over what the user submits. If they do moderation or have owners submit copyrighted stuff, then thats a different story and they would be responsible for what they posted
[01:46:36] <MACscr> but just because other people do things, doesnt make it legal
[01:59:37] <molavy> there is no idea?
[02:16:09] <JohnnyCruz> hi, trying to load scribd doc in an iframe with fancybox, can someone tell me what im doing wrong plz? http://jsfiddle.net/a2BMC/
[02:16:22] <mahal> avandare: you still here ? i tried to elaborate on it a bit
[02:18:23] <molavy> why this code return error on terrible  IE, $(this).trigger({ type : 'keypress', which : 13 });
[02:20:16] <cook1es> jQuery.fn.style = function(style) {	$(this).attr(style); } --- should let me bind --- $('#element').style('color: red;'); --- right?
[02:20:41] <cook1es> nevermind /facepalm
[02:32:21] <zamba> how do i iterate over an object?
[02:33:11] <zamba> i set it up as an associative array in php, and then i used json_encode to embedd it into my html
[02:39:37] <mahal> anva
[02:40:00] <mahal> anvandare: thanks I got it. I need to define the jsqueryui functions also in the script that i am calling.
[02:40:12] <mahal> lucky me
[02:40:14] <mahal> :)
[02:46:38] <Sjors> Hi
[02:47:22] <Sjors> I'm a total Javascript newbie, trying to learn my way around improving UI's for users which I previously would have done with CGI
[02:47:42] <Sjors> now -- I'm working with jQuery to add a click function, i.e. $(...).click(function(e) { code here })
[02:47:57] <Sjors> but now I would like that code to be executed once on document load, and then on every click
[02:48:02] <Sjors> so I moved the function out of the click() line, like this:
[02:48:13] <Sjors> function foo(e) { .... }; $(...).click(foo);
[02:48:54] <Sjors> but now, clicking on the button does not do anything anymore... did I make syntactic assumtions that I should not have?
[02:51:11] <MACscr> why not just set both?
[02:52:27] <seqastian> put the code in a function and use it in the onload and onclick?
[02:52:43] <Sjors> MACscr: then I have to define the function twice, that is ugly code duplication
[02:52:54] <Sjors> MACscr: if I then want to make changes to one function, I also need to change the other, for no real reason
[02:53:06] <Sjors> seqastian: well, isn't .click() the same as setting onclick ?
[02:53:53] <seqastian> { code here } > { function here }
[02:53:54] <Sjors> the point of my question is: it worked when I simply had click(function(e) { ... }) but now that I have function foo(e) { ... }; click(foo) it doesn't
[02:54:10] <seqastian> ic
[02:54:18] <Sjors> can I give through functions by parameters in Javascript / jquery?
[02:54:34] <MACscr> Sjors: http://pastebin.com/bqifN8w2
[02:54:38] <Sjors> I have checked: I can call the function fine from the Javascript console, but the click simply doesn't do anything
[02:54:39] <MACscr> just something simple like that
[02:54:50] <Sjors> MACscr: ah, that could work too
[02:54:51] <Sjors> yeah
[02:54:52] <Sjors> thanks!
[02:54:58] <Sjors> of course. :)
[02:55:06] <Sjors> very good idea
[03:03:44] <sahbeewah> i don't see how that worked when the previous didn't
[03:03:47] <poppiez> hi, I'm trying to add this to my HEAD: <link rel="index" href="test.json" type="application/json">. test.json consists of { test: 1 }. how do I reference 'test' prop in my code?
[03:03:49] <sahbeewah> can someone englighten me
[03:34:11] <MACscr> can someone tell me why when i click on the Start Button, its not properly changing from Start to Pause? http://jsfiddle.net/MWJFe/ It worked fine before i added the jquery mobile js

[04:53:08] <amanda19> http://optimizacijadesign.com/
[04:53:10] <knockknockimhere> yes
[04:53:17] <amanda19> why I have the problem in Chrome?
[04:53:52] <amanda19> only when it loads first time
[04:54:05] <amanda19> all 5 sliders get stacked vertically
[04:56:06] <poppiez> hi, I'm trying to add this to my HEAD: <link rel="index" href="test.json" type="application/json">. test.json consists of { test: 1 }. how do I reference 'test' prop in my code?
[04:56:56] <VeXii> json is javascript
[04:57:19] <VeXii> so application/javascript
[04:57:34] <VeXii> and use a script tag aswell
[04:57:46] <knockknockimhere> does it take 5 seconds for you till the vertical stacking dissappears amanda19?
[04:57:59] <poppiez> VeXii: I need to use rel=index for other purposes
[04:58:22] <VeXii> well set it on a script tag then
[04:58:46] <poppiez> VeXii: well, ok, but how do I actually get the value of test? is test in the window object?
[04:58:58] <knockknockimhere> amanda19?
[04:59:08] <amanda19>  yes knockknockimhere
[04:59:14] <amanda19> something like that
[04:59:18] <DimmuR> Hello i'm trying to use datatables on my webapp. In Firefox everything works perfectly, on IE i get error 'undefined'  is empty or is not an object. My definition for datatables is: $('.datatable').dataTable(); any ideas?
[04:59:23] <knockknockimhere> does it take 5 seconds for the banners to go away?
[04:59:35] <amanda19> knockknockimhere  more 1 second, not 5
[04:59:40] <knockknockimhere> ahkey
[04:59:41] <amanda19> it depends on how fast the images load
[05:00:12] <VeXii> poppiez: check for it. not 100% sure (hangovers)
[05:01:30] <knockknockimhere> okey wel first of all. i see that theres an 800 ms delay in the code where you call for the rotor
[05:01:50] <amanda19> relly?
[05:02:03] <amanda19> so that is less than 1 minute?
[05:02:06] <amanda19> i mean 1 second
[05:02:11] <knockknockimhere> yes
[05:02:19] <amanda19> yes that is the time i have problem
[05:02:34] <amanda19> so should i set it to 0 ms?
[05:02:57] <amanda19> on other sites i use same module and it works just fine
[05:02:59] <knockknockimhere> ow sorry
[05:03:01] <amanda19> same settings
[05:03:02] <knockknockimhere> misread lol
[05:03:10] <knockknockimhere> theres no delay..
[05:03:14] <knockknockimhere> delay is for the menu
[05:03:35] <amanda19> is it possible to hide the sliders, only show the top one?
[05:04:16] <knockknockimhere> depends on how you insert them, you can do it with javascript on document ready
[05:06:54] <knockknockimhere> by adding the following code in the header :   (function(){ $(".theClassOfTheImage").hide();   $(".theClassOfTheImage:first").show();  });   something like that
[05:07:42] <knockknockimhere> the (function() )    is the same as $(document).ready()
[05:07:56] <knockknockimhere> meaning that all the DOM elements are loaded before this code is executed :)
[05:09:52] <amanda19> but that is the module I did not make, do you want me to alter the code?
[05:09:55] <amanda19> knockknockimhere?
[05:10:38] <knockknockimhere> i dont know enough about drupal to tell you how toput it in the header, but you can try add this script to your theme yes
[05:10:40] <knockknockimhere> see if it works
[05:10:47] <knockknockimhere> if not, just delete the line again
[05:10:59] <knockknockimhere> PS: http://optimizacijadesign.com/themes/reno%20%20theme%206/arrow-down.png  <--- you got a 404 in your theme, that image is missing
[05:11:01] <amanda19> oh, so i just need to add this line in the theme?
[05:11:21] <amanda19> knockknockimhere  is tha causing the problem?
[05:12:52] <knockknockimhere> well the problem is: according to my chrome your images are loaded before the script applies the style to the slider
[05:13:24] <knockknockimhere> so what you can do is make sure all images except the first one get hidden, untill the style is applied.
[05:13:47] <knockknockimhere> if you want to just make sure the layout is right before images are loaded then you have to change the order of the jquery.
[05:13:59] <knockknockimhere> now im not an expert on jquery :P but i think that is what is causing your troubles
[05:14:26] <amanda19> ok i upoaded that image
[05:14:28] <amanda19> arrow-down.png
[05:15:01] <knockknockimhere> its the green arrows in the menu bars
[05:15:08] <amanda19> i see that image was just for the menu
[05:15:13] <amanda19> there is no changes in slider
[05:15:38] <knockknockimhere> nah i didnt expect there to be one amanda :P was just stating that your website was requesting an image that doesnt exist
[05:15:50] <amanda19> yes thank you
[05:15:58] <amanda19> do you know hot to do this effect?    http://iztoksmolic.com/

[06:14:51] <minna> Hello peoples.
[06:15:13] <emx> how can i prevent an element from getting the focus?
[06:18:11] <dabear> emx: use blur() however the better question is why do you need to do that?
[06:19:46] <emx> dabear, i have a contenteditable=true with marked text. when i click a button in the document the editable loses the focus. i don't want that.
[06:21:03] <minna> emx: Then you have to re-focus, $("#refocusthis").focus();
[06:21:24] <minna> After the button have been clicked
[06:21:52] <emx> minna, i tried that but what i observe is that the cursor is set to the first position of the editable. am i doing something wrong?
[06:21:59] <texter> Hey guys.... a have a little problem: i'm trying get the position of a text according to the scroll position of it's div. Anyone an idea?
[06:22:20] <minna> emx: No, it always defaults to the start of the input. you cannot tell it to go to the last line, atleast i dont think you can
[06:22:30] <dabear> you can
[06:22:41] <minna> dabear: how?
[06:22:44] <dabear> however, it is not trivial doing that
[06:22:54] <minna> I could imagine.
[06:22:57] <dabear> text selection ranges
[06:23:05] <minna> Ah, yes.
[06:23:08] <dabear> and you gotta have two implementations
[06:23:14] <dabear> one for IE, one for the rest
[06:23:27] <emx> dabear, that's just what i wanted hear :P
[06:23:34] <emx> JFVQ)*çUZVTQ)
[06:24:15] <minna> Perhaps someone can help me, i have a peculiar problem. http://jsfiddle.net/stxpn/ I need the button that matches any of the selector options to show, then when i click the shown button, it will choose that option.
[06:24:40] <minna> Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/stxpn/1/
[06:24:47] <minna> i missed the display none.
[06:28:17] <minna> I'm trying to use the button:contains() selector, but cannot figure out how to write it.
[06:29:25] <seyz> hi guyz !
[06:29:35] <seyz> I'm using jquery inside my expressjs application
[06:29:42] <seyz> I play with socket.io
[06:29:56] <seyz> I would like to render jade template inside my jquery to append the result to a div...
[06:29:58] <seyz> is it possible ?
[06:30:08] <Woet> yup, it's possible.
[06:30:11] <seyz> oh nice!
[06:30:17] <seyz> how xD ?
[06:30:22] <seyz> any idea ?
[06:31:53] <seyz> Woet: ?
[06:32:02] <Woet> i dont know
[06:32:06] <Woet> i just answered your question
[06:32:11] <seyz> haha...
[06:32:24] <seyz> Woet: i'm not sure that it's possible
[06:32:35] <Woet> everything is possible
[06:32:45] <seyz> Woet: ok.
[06:33:19] <seyz> Woet: is it possible to prepare a coffee using a jquery ? In addition, I want to drink the coffee with a pink rabbit !
[06:33:44] <Woet> sure that's possible
[06:34:01] <seyz> I love jquery !
[06:34:09] <Woet> write your own coffee machine, running on linux with spidermonkey
[06:34:12] <Woet> so you can parse jquery :)
[06:37:54] <dabear> minna: I might not fully understand what you wanted to do.. like this? http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/
[06:41:49] <minna> dabear: Thanks for helping me :-) I think you missunderstood a bit. When the page loads, i want to show the buttons the "data-contains" matches to the option text. Then when i click on a button that has been shown, it will select the option that matches the data-contains text.
[06:43:49] <minna> dabear: I think you'r nearly there, i see it returns the buttons that matches in the log.
[06:44:18] <dabear> just .hide() the $buttons and .show() the $matchedButtons ?
[06:45:10] <minna> dabear: Now im really confused, can you show me?
[06:45:22] <dabear> show you what?
[06:45:37] <dabear> was this my or your project
[06:46:17] <minna> dabear: They are hidden by default, and yes, i need to show the matched buttons.
[06:46:27] <dabear> just .hide() the $buttons and .show() the $matchedButtons ?
[06:46:31] <dabear> as I said
[06:47:05] <minna> Ok, ill tinker with it and see if i understand it. Thanks for helping out a noob. :-)
[06:53:30] <rethus> is there a way to readout the visible part of the browser window?
[06:55:07] <minna> dabear: Ah, now it shows the buttons if i select that option, but i wanted it the other way around, it shows the matching buttons by default, then chooses the option when i click the button.
[06:58:58] <kanzie> maybe Im daft here but I just want to make sure. If I follow the module-pattern and I have each module in a separate file. Is it enough just embedding the file in my mail html-page or do I have to make a call to the module to actually execute it in my document.ready(). The self-executing part of the module-pattern makes me think embedding the file should be enough but it feels weird not making a call at all
[07:03:10] <dabear> minna: I don't understand
[07:04:55] <minna> dabear: I wan't to filter out the buttons that matches the option's text, based on the data-contains value, and then show those buttons onLoad. Then when i click any of the buttons that is now showing, it will select in the selector, the text that matches the clicked buttons data-contains.
[07:05:21] <held> hey guys, any idea why I can't work with several lists in JSON? http://jsfiddle.net/d8zHa/
[07:05:38] <minna> dabear: Similar to this one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911093/jquery-attribute-contains-selector
[07:05:42] <held> the bottom loop 'breaks' the application
[07:07:24] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/3/ - minna
[07:07:35] <held> nvm, i was having syntax errors

[07:28:45] <jonthomas83> knockknockimhere thanks
[07:52:30] <minna1> Im just stuck.
[07:54:23] <minna1> dabear: The selector isn't supposed to do anyting, i think you'r missunderstanding what im trying to do.
[07:55:32] <kollapse> Hi. How come the resulting .button() has such huge padding ?
[07:55:45] <minna1> kollapse: CSS?
[07:55:57] <dabear> minna1: I think you should do this your self, and not rely on others to understand what you're not saying:)
[07:56:02] <kollapse> minna1: Well I'm not doing anything in that matter.
[07:57:10] <minna1> dabear: I have been trying to do this for the last 4 hours... I'm just not getting how do do this and i cannot find any other cases with the same problem.
[07:57:27] <minna1> kollapse: Then try styling it :)
[07:57:46] <minna1> *to
[07:57:57] <dabear> minna1: I still don't get what you want, where you're stuck or generally wh
[07:58:32] <minna1> dabear: Like this if button data-contains = option text -> show buttons that matches. If i then click the buttons, the option that matches will be selected.
[08:00:35] <dabear> I showed you how to do the first?
[08:00:42] <black_warlock> hello people
[08:00:42] <dabear> $matchedButtons.show()
[08:00:54] <dabear> black_warlock: hell0!
[08:01:23] <minna1> dabear: Yes, but it depends on the .change event, it will change the selector before i any input on the buttns.
[08:02:56] <black_warlock> i m trying to change  the div content on fly, but i have some problems , because the input box is not a simple input box but its an fckeditor box

[08:03:40] <noob13> hello, my js console is getting: "event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future."... what might be causing this?
[08:04:25] <noob13> is this issue even related to jquery?
[08:04:34] <dabear> noob13: it is fixed in jquery nightly
[08:05:15] <dabear> noob13: jquery does some copying of event properties. two of which are the layerx and layery properties.
[08:05:57] <last1> I have an change() event being listened to for a select box. somehow it gets triggered when the page first loads. why is that ?
[08:06:52] <noob13> dabear: ok, thank you. so should i load a the nightly version instead of jquery-latest.pack.js?
[08:07:21] <dabear> noob13: you should never use packed versions of jquery, ever.
[08:07:56] <noob13> dabear: oh, why is that?
[08:08:05] <dabear> and you can continue using non-nighly versions. its just a visual clue that it will be removed
[08:08:34] <dabear> noob13: please, do some googling. jquery stopped distributing packed versions a long time ago
[08:09:05] <dabear> The packed versions require non-trivial client-side processing time to uncompress (unpack) the code whereas the minified versions do not. The packed versions of jQuery will take less time to download than the minified or uncompressed versions; however, each time the library is loaded (initially or from the browser cache) it will need to be uncompressed which will cause a non-trivial delay in the execution of any jQuery code each time it is loaded.
[08:09:07] <noob13> dabear: but does the message mean something will eventually stop working in my app, or?
[08:10:01] <dabear> ?packed

[09:04:35] <minna1> Woet: There is none, because i haven't solved it.
[09:04:46] <Woet> then which changes did you make?
[09:05:23] <minna1> Woet: I thought through how describe what i need.

[09:05:45] <Woet> then come back when it doesn't work
[09:06:15] <minna1> Woet: But it don't know how to compare the button's data to each of the rows. That's the problem.
[09:07:02] <kanzie> necromancer: hehe, let me update the fiddle with something more to the point of the problem
[09:07:19] <kanzie> I have boiled it down to a scoping-problem for me
[09:07:21] <necromancer> first of all getTimeStamp is cased improperly in the call
[09:07:28] <necromancer> yeah it's definitely a scoping problem
[09:07:52] <necromancer> caching the `this` in its own var helps sometimes

[09:10:27] <Gorkyman> hm... i'm returning a json object from ajax call... (using ajax())... somehow response.jsonobjectname doesnt work?
[09:10:35] <minna1> dabear: That's not it at all, you'r code was fine but it didn't do what i wanted it to do, that's why i made it clear in this fiddle exacly what i want. And you'r code depended on choosing a selector to get the value.
[09:11:15] <dabear> no and no

[09:11:25] <dabear> but I'm not helping you anymore
[09:11:49] <necromancer> minna1: why don't you just learn the language and write it yourself?
[09:11:56] <dabear> I suggest you either pay someone to do it, or read about how to do it your self
[09:11:58] <necromancer> you know what you want
[09:12:04] <Woet> like we all told you several times, minna1
[09:12:07] <Woet> [18:05:39] <Woet> read the docs, use google and make an attempt at the code
[09:12:24] <Woet> we help people code, we don't code for them.
[09:12:41] <Woet> "your code didnt do what i wanted it to do" means you rewrite it, instead of dumping it and asking someone else to write it from scratch
[09:12:54] <minna1> GAH, i don't understand where to start! How do i iterate through each of the buttons and compare each and one of them to the selector and then return the selector that was true to the if statement.
[09:13:05] <Woet> if you don't understand where to start, learn basic javascript and jquery first
[09:13:21] <Woet> and again, READ THE DOCS. READ THE DOCS. READ THE DOCS.
[09:13:26] <Woet> ?docs .each @ minna1
[09:13:34] <Woet> damn you bot-t
[09:13:35] <Woet> ?docs .each @ minna1
[09:13:36] <minna1> I'm trying but my test is tomorrow! i don't have time to read all about javascript and jquery again
[09:13:41] <Woet> lol
[09:13:49] <minna1> i hate beeing slow and blonde :-(
[09:13:51] <Woet> the point of a test is to test your knowledge
[09:13:52] <Woet> not hours.
[09:13:55] <bot-t> minna1, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:13:57] <minna1> im sorry for wasting your time
[09:14:07] <necromancer> you're wasting your time, not ours
[09:14:21] <necromancer> because when you learn how to do this you're never going to forget it
[09:14:33] <necromancer> and the concepts will stick with you throughout your future programming endeavors
[09:15:45] <minna1> necromancer: im just stressed as hell, im sorry, ill take a breath and start again. thanks for helping
[09:16:11] <necromancer> no problem, it happens
[09:16:51] <minna1> Thanks. And im very sorry dabear for not respecting your code, i will go throgh it again.
[09:17:44] <kanzie> necromancer: ok, so in my fiddle, why can't I access the gold using public function getGold()
[09:17:52] <kanzie> necromancer: http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/11/
[09:18:07] <minna1> necromancer: I tried to use .each to iterate through them and using an if statement to check if they matched, but how do i get back the ones that matched? I think im doing it wrong.
[09:18:15] <minna1> necromancer: http://jsfiddle.net/hAqKr/1/
[09:20:08] <necromancer> kanzie: why do you have a method that just calls a function? why don't you just put the function in the method
[09:21:09] <necromancer> kanzie: there's no need for var getGold... http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/12/
[09:21:54] <necromancer> your original function was also globally-scoped, and attempting to access a var that wasn't there (sense). that obj you're returning can't be referenced by anything because it's anonymous
[09:22:14] <necromancer> when you return this.sense.test.gold, it works, because everything's scoped in that object
[09:22:45] <necromancer> but when you create functions like that, they don't automatically pick up the scoping of the object they're called in
[09:23:51] <necromancer> also, a better way of writing that return object is using `this.property` definitions
[09:24:00] <necromancer> in your constructor function (var Hello = function)
[09:24:27] <necromancer> minna1: what's $this?
[09:25:25] <minna1> necromancer: it's supposed to be this without $ right?
[09:25:33] <necromancer> nope
[09:25:40] <necromancer> $this isn't defined
[09:25:45] <necromancer> $ is because it's jQuery
[09:26:11] <necromancer> minna1: were you trying to reference the current thing you were selecting with $.each? if so, that's $(this)
[09:26:34] <necromancer> secondly, you don't write that logic in the if statement in a selector. there are other methods for this
[09:26:34] <minna1> necromancer: ah, right.
[09:27:06] <minna1> necromancer: what methods?
[09:27:22] <kanzie> necromancer: yeah, but my example was constructed to show the case Im stuck with where my public object references a private method that relies on property in the public object
[09:27:47] <minna1> necromancer: Also, the val variable returns all objects that has data-contains, not the text, so i guess that the if statement wont work anyway.
[09:27:52] <necromancer> kanzie: yeah but the private method can't reference a property in the public object unless you use a cached `this` in front of it
[09:28:19] <necromancer> minna1: the if statement isn't constructed properly. you need to actually make a comparison. you're looking to see if the value="" is not -1, right?
[09:28:47] <minna1> necromancer: Yes.
[09:29:04] <necromancer> minna1: HTML only outputs strings, so i wouldn't suggest trying to compare it that way. instead, set your default (Choose) option value to "", not "-1", then check if $(this).val() == ""
[09:29:15] <necromancer> err sorry
[09:29:20] <necromancer> $(this).val() != ""
[09:30:14] <necromancer> minna1: i'd also suggest giving those buttons IDs so they are easily selectable by jQuery
[09:30:20] <minna1> necromancer: The reason i'm not doing this is because the option markup cannot be changed, it's CMS generated.
[09:30:24] <necromancer> you can do $('#mixing-button').show()
[09:30:46] <necromancer> oh well that's stupid. whoever wrote the CMS doesn't understand how HTML DOM returns values
[09:30:52] <necromancer> but that doesn't matter
[09:30:57] <necromancer> just check for != "-1" and you'll be good
[09:30:57] <dunkel2> hello
[09:31:07] <necromancer> if it's not -1, it's one of the other values
[09:32:31] <necromancer> minna1: the hard part looks like finding the text "This" or "Mixing" in your options
[09:32:58] <minna1> necromancer: Yes..
[09:33:00] <necromancer> minna1: btw, the way to select the actual text of the option would be (in this case) $(this).text() or $(this).html() i believe
[09:33:11] <kanzie> necromancer: ok, so to get http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/13/ to work, what do I need to do? Im not sure I understand the problem here. I want a function in a public object to access another public function
[09:33:21] <dabear> necromancer: just give it up, I gave him the code for that already, several hours ago
[09:33:28] <dabear> he just doesn't understand how to use it
[09:33:35] <minna1> dabear: She.
[09:33:37] <necromancer> any time you want to select "something" in <tag>something</tag>, you use .html() or .text()
[09:33:46] <necromancer> dabear: giving someone code doesn't teach them anything
[09:34:07] <necromancer> necessarily
[09:34:16] <necromancer> i do have to go get some breakfast though :)
[09:34:20] <kanzie> which in turn tries to access a public property
[09:34:21] <dabear> it was the last option I had, after telling her how to do it, she still didn't understand
[09:34:31] <kanzie> necromancer: it the nesting that is the problem?
[09:35:33] <necromancer> kanzie: `this` inside sense refers to sense, not the object you're returning
[09:36:05] <kanzie> necromancer: I see… so what is a proper way to circumvent this
[09:36:54] <kanzie> guess I could move my function inside sense
[09:37:20] <necromancer> you could
[09:37:26] <necromancer> but there's a better way of writing objects than this
[09:37:49] <kanzie> necromancer: please tell me
[09:38:17] <minna1> dabear: You'r code triggers a change of the option markup, this in turn triggers an ajax request, that's why i cannot rely on changing the option and could'nt use that code.
[09:39:27] <dabear> minna1: did you ever think of moving the code out of the change handler? replacing "this" with a reference to the dom object (the select)
[09:40:37] <minna1> dabear: I tried that, but perhaps i didn't try it enought. I'll check.
[09:41:47] <necromancer> kanzie: http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/14/
[09:42:38] <necromancer> kanzie: you might also want to check out http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html
[09:43:01] <kanzie> necromancer: so you recommend against the module-pattern?
[09:43:11] <necromancer> i don't know what the module-pattern is
[09:43:26] <necromancer> but that's the way i write my JS objects and it works
[09:43:37] <kanzie> necromancer: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/
[09:44:30] <necromancer> oh ok
[09:44:45] <dabear> kanzie: I see little reason for using that pattern , and no reason to use it when developing jquery code
[09:44:50] <necromancer> it's pretty much the same idea, kanzie
[09:44:58] <necromancer> except this way seems to make more sense to me
[09:45:02] <dabear> you either implement a jquery plugin, or a jquery widget
[09:45:10] <kanzie> dabear: saves me a lot of 'new' statements, allows private methods and vars
[09:45:32] <necromancer> knowing that anything `this.` is going to be treated as the "public object", you simply don't prefix vars with `this` when you want them to be private
[09:45:56] <necromancer> crockford > YUI even though he works for yahoo :)
[09:46:02] <dabear> kanzie: with jquery ui widgets you don't use new-statements, you have private methods too
[09:46:03] <minna1> dabear: What is this.options?
[09:46:06] <necromancer> consider how many people aren't using YUI right now
[09:46:45] <dabear> minna1: The options collection returns an array of all the options in a dropdown list.
[09:46:48] <dabear> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/coll_select_options.asp
[09:47:20] <necromancer> kanzie: the logic of using that pattern breaks down as soon as you need private members to access public members
[09:47:42] <necromancer> notice how none of their examples do that
[09:47:44] <kanzie> necromancer: yeah, but the self=this trick would solve that then
[09:47:54] <ravenzz> ?w3schools @ dabear
[09:47:54] <bot-t> dabear, http://w3fools.com
[09:47:57] <necromancer> kanzie: right like i said it's basically the same thing
[09:48:01] <kanzie> sweet
[09:48:08] <necromancer> it's just a different way of writing it
[09:48:28] <necromancer> i think doing this.<whatever> is a lot easier to read than doing return { <whatever> }
[09:48:34] <dabear> ravenzz: yep, I am part of that w3fools site. however, not all info is wrong, so you shouldn't discard it completely
[09:48:45] <minna1> dabear: Hm, that's what i thought but i searched for jquery not javascript, dooh! Anyway i tried moving out your code, but i got undefined error. http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/5/
[09:49:28] <espressive> If I do $("#someid").append("selector :not(selector)") should jQuery not select the content in the selector and then append it to the new container leaving the original content in tact?
[09:49:43] <ravenzz> dabear oh lol :p anyway if a good buddy links w3schools ppl could think that its a good reference in the future
[09:50:14] <dabear> minna1: the dollar in front of options ( $options ) signalizes that the variable contaisn a jquery element. jquery elements do not have an option attribute, the containing dom element does, though
[09:51:28] <dabear> ravenzz: im @bjorninge if you look on the "FROM:" part of the site
[09:53:04] <minna1> dabear: So how do i reference the variable in the correct way?
[09:53:24] <dabear> minna1: see ?attr
[09:53:24] <bot-t> minna1, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:53:33] <dabear> or .get(0).options
[09:53:46] <dabear> .attr("options")
[09:54:21] <ravenzz> dabear np I am sure you are aware about that
[09:54:24] <dabear> minna1: this is fundamental knowledge. you should REALLY learn the language and the dom first
[09:54:46] <dabear> ravenzz: :)
[09:54:50] <Tatsh> anyone here used jquery lint?
[09:54:54] <minna1> dabear: I know, im terribly slow and this course is going way  too fast :-(
[09:54:56] <Tatsh> i don't get what this error means
[09:55:06] <Tatsh> Insted of accessing the property via attr(id), use undefined insted
[09:55:20] <Tatsh> it coudln't come up with an alternative which is why it says undefined
[09:55:22] <Woet> then switch to a different course, minna1
[09:55:45] <dabear> minna1: generally, when taking computer courses, you should already be interested and done *some* work before taking the course
[09:55:58] <Tatsh> the line '        var id = $(this).attr('id') + (Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000));
[09:56:01] <minna1> Woet: If i don't finish this course, i won't get any loan for my rent. It's that bad.
[09:56:06] <dabear> not much, but you should have a generalt understanding
[09:56:18] <Tatsh> dabear, you're funny
[09:56:29] <dabear> Tatsh: thanks, I guess?
[09:56:36] <minna1> dabear: I have, i know fluid photoshop, html and css, javascript is the new part.
[09:56:38] <Tatsh> but i'm sure you are aware of the amount of respect computer anything gets
[09:56:43] <ravenzz> minna1 at most 1 week read: eloquentjavascript.net
[09:57:05] <Tatsh> so, what's the faster alternative that jquery lint is trying to suggest to me?
[09:57:10] <Tatsh> for $(this).attr('id')
[09:57:51] <ravenzz> minna1 then you would peek into the jquery documentation easily and faster
[09:57:51] <minna1> ravenzz: Thanks!
[10:00:16] <OtherlandDK> Hi everyone
[10:00:36] <OtherlandDK> I've got a question in regards to the jQuery UI dialog...
[10:02:38] <minna1> dabear: Geesh, i feel like im all in the dark here. http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/7/
[10:03:13] <minna1> dabear: I changed the .options to .attr("option") but still get undefined, there's something i don't understand.
[10:04:01] <OtherlandDK> I've got a dialog defined as shown here : http://pastebin.com/jrin3MK2, and I want one of the buttons to be the default button, so the user can press Enter...
[10:05:14] <Tatsh> OtherlandDK, just bind the return keyCode keyup or keydown to perform a click on the default button
[10:05:44] <OtherlandDK> when I add this option to the defenition: open: function() { $(this).parents('.ui-dialog-buttonpane button:eq(0)').focus(); } I can see that the first button (the OK button) does get the focus class... but it's not visible for the user plus pressing Enter doesn't do a thing
[10:06:34] <OtherlandDK> and if I select the dialog itself, by pressing the mouse... and then press the Tab key once, I can then see that the 'OK' button is selected and a press on Enter executes the click event on the button
[10:06:47] <lolgolflol> hi, I have simply question about grammar. when I will create question sentence. case 1  “what is ROR mean?” case 2 “what ROR is mean?” that is someone else?
[10:07:18] <lolgolflol> I am not good english skill ?
[10:07:21] <lolgolflol> .
[10:07:42] <OtherlandDK> Tatsh: That works.. but I 'need' to let the user use the tab key and the keyboard.. so he/she can tab to another button and press Enter... I'm not sure I know how to do that...
[10:07:53] <Tatsh> OtherlandDK, don't do that though; just use $(this).dialog( "option", "buttons" ); to get the buttons
[10:08:06] <ravenzz> minna1 what are you trying to do?
[10:08:41] <OtherlandDK> I'm one big questionmark... and what should I do with the buttons ?
[10:08:43] <Tatsh> OtherlandDK, tab key event would focus then to the next tabindex; but keypress of enter key and only enter key will press the default button
[10:09:05] <Tatsh> OtherlandDK, don't try to get to the internals of jQuery UI; just use the API
[10:09:58] <Tatsh> since dialogs have a 'closeOnEscape' option, you may want to look at jquery ui dialog source to see how that is implemented
[10:10:37] <OtherlandDK> Tatsh: ok, I'll do that as a start... and thanks for the help.. so far ;-)
[10:11:04] <Tatsh> you just need to ensure you only perform focus() or click() on $('#yourdialog').dialog('widget')
[10:12:04] <Tatsh> elements within that; $('#yourdialog').dialog('widget') functions as your selector (replacing $('#yourdialog'))
[10:12:43] <Tatsh> using apply there may be a nice way to make the event trigger without getting into the internals of how the dialog is constructed
[10:13:21] <OtherlandDK> ok.. so as long my dialog is shown, I should only 'allow' focus and keypress on $('#yourdialog').dialog('widget')
[10:15:31] <kanzie> necromancer: ok, I still don't get this it seems… It makes sense in my head but the scope seems to act different from how I understand it. I have made a constructed example of my problems at http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/15/
[10:15:52] <Tatsh> well, no; something like the following (which is definitely not correct but correctable i suppose): $('#yourdialog').dialog('widget').keypress(function () { if (/* Button is enter */) { $(this).dialog('option', 'buttons')[0].trigger('click'); }
[10:16:22] <Tatsh> so that goes after your initial .dialog() call
[10:16:54] <kanzie> necromancer: I see no reason why that shouldn't work
[10:17:29] <Tatsh> jquery ui standards say event.keyCode so use that
[10:17:37] <Tatsh> i think jquery UI defines an ENTER_KEY value or similar
[10:18:26] <kanzie> if anyone understand why my scoping is wrong here, please shine a light
[10:18:27] <kanzie> http://jsfiddle.net/m6Ex5/17/
[10:19:00] <OtherlandDK> ok Tatsh.. thanks... :-)
[10:19:21] <Tatsh> OtherlandDK, if no such feature request exists, suggest this to jQuery UI
[10:19:30] <OtherlandDK> I will ;-)
[10:19:37] <Tatsh> 'defaultButton' or something, because this is very common functionality in almost all GUI toolkits
[10:19:57] <espressive> I bekieve I have found a bug in jQuery, have a look here: http://jsfiddle.net/MHQyg/1/
[10:20:08] <espressive> believe*
[10:30:36] <minna1> ravenzz: This is what im trying to do.. been at it for many hours now. : If the data-contains attribute matches any option text, take the attribute from that option and add it to the button that matches, then show that button.
[10:31:15] <minna1> ravenzz: If it wasn't for dabear and necromancer i would probably still be stuck on reading page after page and googling.
[10:37:10] <necromancer> minna1: so is the life of starting developers. remember, we all had to do it at one point :)
[10:37:43] <necromancer> only reason i started doing this in the first place was because i had no friends in high school and i needed a way to pass the time that wasn't practicing music or something
[10:37:53] <necromancer> so i had time :)
[10:38:00] <minna1> necromancer: If i had more time, i would not be complaning, get me wrong, i love learning this stuff!
[10:38:11] <minna1> don't
[10:38:25] <necromancer> yeah it just takes time unfortunately...
[10:38:38] <minna1> necromancer: i started with photoshop 4.0, but never got into programming
[10:38:43] <necromancer> unless someone's taken up part of their time to write you a guide or whatever :)
[10:38:45] <elitejayhg> ?
[10:39:02] <minna1> necromancer: That's just it, i've learned sooo much by hanging in here!
[10:39:56] <clir-out> hi.. i have $(".a_container ul.aline_items li") which is working. but i want to use the variable i declared var a_container = $(".a_container"). how will i do that using the variable?
[10:41:52] <minna1> necromancer: I think i learn best by example though, then commenting on each row on what it does, then req-write it into new code. Like i do with graphics and html,css. But i guess javascript you have to think like construction.
[10:44:11] <asdf`> clir-out, with $("ul.aline_items li", a_container)
[10:44:52] <clir-out> tnx asdf` il try it now
[10:45:28] <dancole> Isn't there a way to style the selection box that is created while your selecting elements with selectable?
[10:46:00] <necromancer> minna1: yeah you have to DESIGN your code :)
[10:47:11] <minna1> necromancer: And to do that you need to know what each part does, and without experience one can but guess :-)
[10:48:41] <amh345> in my main .js file i get a '$('form#new_user[data-validate]').validate(); is not a function error' when i load my form in a modal.   im guessing because that form not available when the dom loads? is there a way around this?
[10:49:59] <necromancer> minna1: right but when you design the code first, you can then break down the big problem into a series of smaller problems. perhaps the sample at the beginning of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz4dVof3mTc
[10:50:10] <necromancer> perhaps the sample at the beginning of this video will enlighten you*
[10:50:51] <minna1> necromancer: anyway, do you think you can help me understand dabears code, i changed the $options.options variable to $options.attr("option") but still get undefined error. I don't think dabear is here any more? I really just wan't to get further so i can go on next task before tomorrow. :-S
[10:51:22] <clir-out> asdf` the code works. but when i put it in droppable. aceept: $("ul.aline_items li", a_container) . it didnt work out. any suggestion please?
[10:51:55] <minna1> necromancer: That's how i work with design, instead of trying to create an idéa i sketch several idéas and brainstorms towards the finished result.
[10:52:53] <minna1> necromancer: latest version http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/7/
[10:56:46] <necromancer> i've never used .filter(), minna1
[10:57:24] <minna1> necromancer: Ok, thanks anyway. :-)
[11:02:29] <clir-out> please anyone can help me?
[11:03:50] <ravenzz> ?ask @ clir-out
[11:03:50] <bot-t> clir-out, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:04:20] <clir-out> [02:39:50] <clir-out> hi.. i have $(".a_container ul.aline_items li") which is working. but i want to use the variable i declared var a_container = $(".a_container"). how will i do that using the variable?
[11:04:26] <clir-out> [02:44:05] <asdf`> clir-out, with $("ul.aline_items li", a_container)
[11:04:37] <clir-out> [02:51:16] <clir-out> asdf` the code works. but when i put it in droppable. aceept: $("ul.aline_items li", a_container) . it didnt work out. any suggestion please?
[11:05:10] <clir-out> accept*
[11:05:48] <ravenzz> minna1 I am back, have you figured it out?
[11:06:37] <clir-out> can you help me ravenzz?
[11:07:01] <clir-out> please
[11:07:29] <ravenzz> do you have a demo?
[11:08:05] <necromancer> minna1: http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/8/
[11:08:13] <necromancer> that's how i would do it, given your specs
[11:08:45] <necromancer> i intentionally made all the variable names verbose so you'd understand exactly what $(this) is at any stage in the logic, and what every variable represents
[11:09:13] <clir-out> ravenzz: i dont have right now
[11:09:41] <necromancer> minna1: i suggest you do the same when you're starting out, it will help your mind comprehend all of this virtual shit going on
[11:10:00] <necromancer> as a designer you're probably very visually-oriented, so this will help you read the code back to yourself and sort-of understand what's going on
[11:10:10] <minna1> necromancer: Ah, i cannot use the dropdown to show the buttons. If i use the dropdown the CMS we are using for these exercise will load ajax. To be exact, this is how it needs to work: If the data-contains attribute matches any option text, take the attribute from that option and add it to the button that matches, then show that button.
[11:10:57] <necromancer> what do you mean by "add it to the button that matches"?
[11:10:58] <minna1> necromancer: Very nice code! I will try and comment each row to see if i understand everything.
[11:11:45] <minna1> necromancer: add the attribute, this way i can click the button and it will select the correct option. :)
[11:11:46] <necromancer> minna1: read each line back to yourself, out loud if you must, except replace all "$" and "("/")" with spaces, like don't recite them
[11:12:21] <rogerpfaff> hello
[11:12:29] <necromancer> so line 13 would be "if this button data-contains equals the selected word at the word index, then
[11:12:36] <necromancer> and line 14 would be "hide buttons"
[11:12:42] <necromancer> and line 15 would be "show this button"
[11:12:44] <necromancer> you get the general idea
[11:13:29] <necromancer> JS isn't as readable as other languages but with a little bit of effort you can make it a lot easier for others to understand
[11:13:44] <rogerpfaff> i have a form where I validate fields with the click event on submit button. standard form action is a php file which is not executed but displayed in the browser
[11:14:51] <minna1> necromancer: Indexing is something i really really have to learn, i've been avoiding it actually ;)
[11:15:10] <necromancer> it's just a number that references a point in the array
[11:15:23] <necromancer> but it works differently than what you think
[11:15:34] <necromancer> like if i have an array of ['one', 'two', 'three']
[11:15:41] <necromancer> to get "one", i have to do array[0]
[11:15:50] <necromancer> because arrays start at position 0, not position 1
[11:15:54] <minna1> necromancer: Yes, but it becomes so hard for me to grasp when the array needs to be combined with a comparison.
[11:15:56] <necromancer> position 1 would be "two"
[11:15:59] <necromancer> exactly
[11:16:04] <necromancer> well JS makes it a little easier
[11:16:15] <necromancer> notice how in that for() loop i do selectedWords.length?
[11:16:35] <minna1> Yes?
[11:16:36] <necromancer> selectedWords.length is the number of things in the array, not the highest position possible in the array
[11:16:49] <necromancer> so that's why wordIndex < selectedWords.length works
[11:16:56] <necromancer> instead of having to do <=
[11:17:30] <necromancer> so to find the highest position possible, you just do selectedWords.length-1
[11:17:43] <necromancer> because in that example array i showed you a few messages ago, the .length would be 3
[11:17:51] <necromancer> though the only indicies that work are 0, 1 and 2
[11:18:03] <minna1> necromancer: So for the loop it's. While the variable is equal to zero continue checking words until all contains
[11:18:32] <necromancer> no, not quite. you're thinking while loop
[11:18:37] <necromancer> for is the same idea but quicker to write
[11:18:53] <minna1> what is the difference?
[11:19:06] <minna1> in this example i mean.
[11:19:34] <necromancer> what that loop is saying is "while the newly declared variable wordIndex (starting at 0) is less than the length of the selectedWords array, increment wordIndex by one after every iteration of.."
[11:19:43] <s5fs> Anyone have experience with jquery mobile? I'm having trouble with changePage behavior, it seems to bork up when traversing forward and backward.
[11:20:15] <necromancer> while's for when you don't need to reference that index number, because it keeps track of how many times the loop is run
[11:20:38] <minna1> necromancer: Ok, this takes some getting into the right thinking :-)
[11:21:09] <minna1> necromancer: But how can i show the buttons without using the option select?
[11:22:00] <knockknockimhere> a for loop is a quicker way of writing       var i = 0;  var x = 20;   while (i < x){ i++;         way more managable allso
[11:22:47] <knockknockimhere> and s5fs sorry cant help you :(
[11:23:10] <minna1> necromancer: So the split breaks apart the string into array?
[11:24:45] <s5fs> knockknockimhere: no worries, thanks for the reply :-)
[11:25:48] <minna1> necromancer: Ah, i see how it works now.
[11:25:58] <necromancer> minna1: yes
[11:26:25] <necromancer> in javascript, everything is an object including Arrays
[11:26:30] <s5fs> necromancer: fwiw, you're providing an exemplary level of support in this channel
[11:26:31] <minna1> necromancer: You get all the text from all option values, then break up all words into an array, then compare each word to the data values of the button data. Thus showing the button if it matches.
[11:26:38] <necromancer> haha
[11:26:40] <abjorn> even your face is an object
[11:26:43] <s5fs> necromancer: not everything, primitives are still primitives
[11:26:44] <necromancer> come on man this is easy
[11:26:45] <abjorn> face.ugly = true;
[11:27:02] <necromancer> oh yeah i guess numbers aren't objects
[11:27:21] <necromancer> like you can't do 12.call('something') lol
[11:27:24] <s5fs> i'm just being a pedantic ass, nevermind me ;-)
[11:27:26] <abjorn> primitives are object-like
[11:28:11] <minna1> stop messing with necromancer or i'll namespace you'r asses... :-P
[11:28:40] <s5fs> abjorn: object-like how? just curious
[11:28:42] <necromancer> "namespace"?
[11:28:43] <necromancer> haha
[11:28:46] <minna1> ;)
[11:28:47] <s5fs> haha!
[11:29:07] <s5fs> careful, we'll suggest you use inefficient selectors (ooh sick burn!)
[11:29:14] <abjorn> uh, well they have methods, for one, s5fs
[11:29:40] <minna1> s5fs: I would prob fall for it.
[11:30:03] <necromancer> abjorn: numbers do not have methods
[11:30:19] <abjorn> o.O
[11:30:36] <necromancer> afaik...
[11:30:39] <abjorn> I beg to differ
[11:30:42] <necromancer> wait
[11:30:43] <necromancer> really?
[11:30:48] <s5fs> abjorn: well, you can call toString on numbers, haha
[11:30:55] <abjorn> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number
[11:30:55] <necromancer> like i can do 12.prototype.someMethod = function() { ... }
[11:31:03] <abjorn> toExponential() toFixed(), etc
[11:31:16] <abjorn> numbers have methods, just not many
[11:31:59] <minna1> ... i just cannot wrap my head around doing this the other way around.
[11:33:32] <s5fs> abjorn: good link, thx.
[11:33:43] <abjorn> np
[11:33:57] <abjorn> all values in javascript are more or less an object
[11:34:03] <s5fs> abjorn: right, except primitives
[11:34:09] <abjorn> like what, s5fs
[11:34:29] <abjorn> I mean, they're all basically objects
[11:34:37] <abjorn> strings, numbers, arrays, functions, etc
[11:34:46] <s5fs> abjorn: per the docs, ints, strings and bools
[11:35:05] <s5fs> abjorn: having a helper object is what provides the methods iirc, and per your link
[11:35:07] <abjorn> you can do new String(), etc
[11:35:26] <abjorn> I mean, the underlying value is not an object
[11:35:30] <abjorn> but you can't get to that in the javascript
[11:35:44] <s5fs> abjorn: right, gotta dive deeper
[11:35:51] <abjorn> NEED TO GO DEEPER
[11:36:08] <abjorn> but yeah, that's an implementation thing, as far as a javascript programmer is concerned, they're all objects
[11:36:15] <s5fs> abjorn: it rarely matters in practice, but if you're expecting an int and typeof retuns object, that's gunna mess you up
[11:36:29] <abjorn> well, not
[11:36:32] <abjorn> it's not going to do that
[11:36:43] <abjorn> although in some cases it can
[11:37:38] <s5fs> abjorn: i do love arguing semantics, haha! i don't dive deep enough to concern myself with the real guts tho, tbh
[11:37:41] <abjorn> ?eval typeof (new Number(1))
[11:37:43] <bot-t> abjorn: "object"
[11:37:45] <abjorn> :)
[11:38:05] <s5fs> ?eval typeof (7)
[11:38:05] <bot-t> s5fs: "number"
[11:38:08] <s5fs> haha
[11:38:40] <abjorn> yeah that's why you don't use new Number(), new String(), etc
[11:39:32] <s5fs> ?eval a=7; typeof(a);
[11:39:32] <bot-t> s5fs: "number"
[11:39:58] <s5fs> ?eval a=7; a.toString();
[11:39:58] <bot-t> s5fs: "7"
[11:40:09] <s5fs> ?eval a=7; a.toString(); typeof(a);
[11:40:10] <bot-t> s5fs: "number"
[11:40:14] <s5fs> haha
[11:40:53] <s5fs> abjorn: so hrm. in what instances would a number be cast into an object, only when calling a helper method?
[11:41:06] <abjorn> far as I know
[11:42:15] <s5fs> abjorn: you any experience with jquery mobile?
[11:43:14] <abjorn> not particularly
[11:44:03] <minna1> necromancer: Hm, im trying to show the buttons when the page loads using your example, and i can get the first button that matches the index to show, but how would i go about showing all the buttons that matches? http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/10/
[11:44:56] <s5fs> abjorn: too bad. i'm struggling to get some basic functionality working, i think the docs don't match what the library actually provides.. or i'm a slow learner (or both)
[11:45:30] <Hackwar> hi folks, how can I slide in an element from the side instead from top or bottom?
[11:48:32] <poppiez> hi, I have a page on my website with lots of markup and images. I want to avoid all of this to load IF JS is supported. is there a way to empty the body BEFORE it loads?
[11:50:39] <minna1> I am so gonna fail this course.
[11:51:44] <s5fs> minna1: that's the spirit!
[11:53:44] <jcoco> I want to create a custom tooltip for sections of an svg graphic. The tooltip libraries I have seen rely on anchor tags. Is there a way around this?
[11:57:31] <jcoco> Okay, well apparently I can get them to work with things other than anchor tags, but not svg paths.
[11:58:01] <s5fs> jcoco: haha!
[11:58:21] <s5fs> jcoco: i'm debugging my own mess, but likely you're just looking for the hover state, right?
[11:59:40] <jcoco> Yeah, I just want it to show the tooltip when you hover over a path inside the svg.
[12:00:25] <necromancer> minna1: why do your specifications keep changing?
[12:00:55] <minna1> necromancer: They have been the same all the time. dabear just missunderstood me.
[12:01:55] <necromancer> minna1: you said "To be exact, this is how it needs to work: If the data-contains attribute matches any option text, take the attribute from that option and add it to the button that matches, then show that button."
[12:01:58] <necromancer> that's what the code does
[12:02:27] <minna1> necromancer: The first thing i asked when i joined this channel was: I need the button that matches any of the selector options to show, then when i click the shown button, it will choose that option.
[12:02:54] <dabear> women shouldn't use computers, they should be in kitchen!
[12:02:57] <dabear> :-p
[12:03:05] <minna1> dabear: ...
[12:03:20] <minna1> Now that comment was just a matter of time.
[12:03:37] <minna1> I'm doing my best here. :-(
[12:04:17] <necromancer> so you need all the buttons to show, basically
[12:04:22] <dabear> well, minna1, you're kinda sking US to the work for YOU. so technically, you're not doing anything, WE are..
[12:04:24] <minna1> Im telling you over and over, i need the buttons to show if it matches the input that has that text.
[12:04:28] <s5fs> jcoco: dig http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/data-visualisation/mouseover-effects-svgs may get you a bit closer, they're binding hover on rects
[12:04:45] <necromancer> and then when you click the button, it selects the proper element from the options list
[12:04:51] <minna1> YES
[12:04:54] <minna1> Finally
[12:05:09] <necromancer> ok so that's completely backwards from what you told me
[12:05:19] <minna1> But it must be me that is explaning it all wrong all this time.
[12:05:48] <necromancer> that's a lot easier lol
[12:05:48] <minna1> Yeah, i must be very bad at explaining things... luckily i'm not a teacher
[12:05:59] <minna1> It is?
[12:06:28] <necromancer> oh wait no it isnt you still have to parse words
[12:06:30] <necromancer> haha
[12:06:43] <minna1> Yeah, and each option too.
[12:06:54] <minna1> So how do i do a double each ;)
[12:08:10] <dabear> necromancer: this was my guess 6 hours ago: http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/3/
[12:08:38] <dabear> by guess, I mean "my attemt at understanding what she wanted"
[12:09:06] <minna1> I showed him that, he said he haven't worked with .filter
[12:11:01] <minna1> So i got another version doing a similar thing but using split on all option words, then comparing each word to the data attributes, thus showing the selected option if it matches.
[12:12:34] <minna1> Both of you'r samples are great, but well, not what i needed since i cannot get input from the option select because the CMS launches an ajax request then. I think i mentioned that.
[12:14:56] <dabear> minna1: you should split up your task into several minor tasks. complete the first before doing the next. e.g. start with one button and find out what you wanna do with it
[12:15:45] <minna1> dabear: Im reading up on double each, it may work well on this.
[12:16:30] <necromancer> http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/11/
[12:16:38] <jcoco> s5fs: This looks like a good start, though I was hoping to use something existing. Sorry, I met someone in a coffee shop and we got to talking :)
[12:17:18] <mobo> anybody good @ multidimensional  json arrays?
[12:17:48] <necromancer> JSON FROM THE FIFTH DIMENSION
[12:17:55] <necromancer> halloween is over, mobo
[12:18:06] <mobo> i wish
[12:18:24] <minna1> necromancer: If only the Nothing text was static, the thing is, in the task we don't know what the text might be. And only the buttons that match is supposed to show.
[12:19:24] <minna1> necromancer: And the first value should be the one selected by default. http://jsfiddle.net/L4CAV/12/
[12:19:51] <necromancer> you never said that
[12:19:55] <necromancer> see you keep changing
[12:19:56] <necromancer> lol
[12:19:59] <necromancer> this is retarded
[12:20:14] <minna1> necromancer: It is in my fist sample, dabear changed that for some reason.
[12:20:24] <necromancer> no
[12:20:51] <minna1> no?
[12:20:52] <necromancer> i'm pretty sure you can figure it out from here i think
[12:21:00] <sean``> don't overestimate
[12:21:05] <necromancer> hah
[12:21:11] <necromancer> that was a jumble
[12:21:19] <necromancer> anyway i think you can figure it out from here, minna1
[12:21:26] <minna1> Ok, i'll try.
[12:21:30] <sean``> don't underestimate yourself!
[12:21:33] <necromancer> you gotta learn jquery sometime
[12:21:43] <minna1> Remember, i'm a woman :-P
[12:21:45] <sean``> you can do it minna1 !
[12:21:55] <minna1> sean``: Thanks
[12:23:54] <dabear> sean``: she's supposed to cook me dinner, not code ;)
[12:24:18] <sean``> dabear, so you let her code and cook?
[12:24:30] <dabear> nah, she can't do either
[12:24:31] <dabear> :p
[12:24:34] <sean``> HA!
[12:24:51] <minna1> ...
[12:25:04] <sean``> no beef with me!
[12:25:07] <sean``> it's all dabear :-P
[12:25:32] <minna1> HA!
[12:25:33] <dabear> if she cooked me some beef, it would ok tho
[12:25:50] <minna1> Im really good at making beef.
[12:26:18] <minna1> actually
[12:29:20] <dabear> if you're coming to norway some time, we gotta meet, so that you can make me some meat :)
[12:29:31] <sean``> minna1, I have wraps :-D
[12:29:37] <sean``> ezpz and delish
[12:29:38] <minna1> dabear: No way, i hear you rape all women over there!
[12:29:46] <sean``> LOL
[12:30:08] <minna1> Seriously, it's all over the news.. horny norweigan men.
[12:32:44] <dabear> minna1: men rape women all over the world. however, you will be safe with me :)
[12:33:11] <minna1> dabear: That's what all rapists say.
[12:33:12] <wirehack8> hello, i am searchin for a example to do this: i have a div with dynamic height, it's bottom:0px and right:0px; inside this div is a table with visibilty:hidden; all i want is that i click a <a>, then the div slide ups to show it's content, like the table is visible
[12:34:31] <RobertV> is it possible to use .find() if your jquery object doesn't have a hierarch? $('<a>link</a><p>para</p>').find('a'); // only works for <element><a></a><p></p></element>
[12:36:08] <Dionysius> hi there
[12:36:12] <dabear> RobertV: yes, .filter("a")
[12:36:23] <RobertV> okay, thanks.
[12:36:45] <Dionysius> i have a strange thing, with element.parent(selector); i don't get the expected result
[12:36:56] <Dionysius> element is a td and selector is table
[12:36:59] <Dionysius> should work -.-
[12:37:44] <dabear> Dionysius: you probably want .closest("selector")
[12:38:08] <Dionysius> i'll try that
[12:38:15] <wirehack8> well, look on this: http://snpr.cm/lCjJFI.png have you a example how to do this? Cause the height is dynamic, not fixed of the table, so bottom with negative value wont work :(
[12:39:51] <Dionysius> dabear: thanks a lot !
[12:40:02] <_jfb> hello. Can history.js be sued for 'select' elements in a form?
[12:40:12] <aaronmcadam> check with a lawyer ;)
[12:40:15] <Dionysius> i've to figure out, because I thought i'd used parent also like that
[12:40:26] <dabear> Dionysius: .parent only searches the first parent. so you will either get 0 or 1 element
[12:40:46] <aaronmcadam> closest?
[12:41:11] <Dionysius> thats the point
[12:41:27] <Dionysius> and the selector is an additional if-like statement, if it should be returned?
[12:41:29] <held> #hibernate

[12:48:27] <black_warlock> can sombody help me with a little script
[12:48:56] <black_warlock> i have js function to preview a div content
[12:49:17] <cornfeed> hello
[12:49:58] <black_warlock> how can i let it works while digiting ?
[12:50:16] <poppiez> I have a bunch of images on my page. I want jquery to replace all src properties with data-src instead before the images load. is this possible?
[12:50:56] <black_warlock> yes
[12:52:11] <black_warlock> but thats server side replace
[12:52:28] <black_warlock> you mean src="" ?
[12:52:35] <poppiez> black_warlock: that won't work since I do want the images to load if no JS is supported
[12:52:57] <poppiez> yeah
[12:52:57] <poppiez> basically just a way to prevent images from loading
[12:53:04] <poppiez> (by replacing the src or whatever)
[12:53:14] <black_warlock> when you print the code can use a fly replace
[12:53:29] <black_warlock> whats your main lenguale
[12:53:40] <black_warlock> lenguage
[12:53:56] <poppiez> Danish :)
[12:54:04] <black_warlock> O.o
[12:54:26] <black_warlock> simple html ? php , asp ? asp.net ?
[12:54:34] <aaronmcadam> lolll
[12:55:27] <poppiez> black_warlock: simple html
[12:57:43] <poppiez> I guess this does the trick :http://home.langdonx.com:8000/demos/js/prevent%5Floading.html
[13:04:51] <Prog_101> Hello I'm trying to create a penny auction, but with the timer, I want it to run even when "there is no one to see it"
[13:05:00] <black_warlock> look this
[13:05:01] <black_warlock> http://www.pelicanfly.co.uk/wordpress/replacing-html-tags-using-jquery/
[13:05:14] <klafka1> if you want to select all the table rows of a table with an id 'foo' how would you do that? i know it's $('#foo') for the id
[13:06:12] <black_warlock> yep
[13:06:18] <black_warlock> $('#foo')
[13:06:31] <klafka1> but if i wanted to then select, all the table rows from $('#foo')
[13:07:04] <Prog_101> so $('#foo tr')
[13:07:14] <black_warlock> yup
[13:07:16] <Prog_101> just like in css
[13:07:20] <klafka1> aah ok thanks
[13:07:27] <klafka1> I don't really know CSS either :P
[13:07:33] <Prog_101> yep oh
[13:07:53] <black_warlock> selecting a div with id foo  $('#foo div')
[13:08:14] <black_warlock> and so on
[13:08:18] <klafka1> wait so is $('#foo tr') selecting a table row, with id foo
[13:08:19] <Prog_101> I want a timer to run even when "there is no one to see it"
[13:08:24] <Prog_101> yep
[13:08:39] <black_warlock> you must set the start timer
[13:08:40] <Prog_101> so $(table tr')
[13:08:44] <klafka1> aah k
[13:08:44] <black_warlock> !!!!!
[13:08:58] <Prog_101> but it will only run hen someone is on the site
[13:09:03] <black_warlock> if you have a starting point the timer will run always and you will see the time remaining
[13:09:09] <Prog_101> oh ok
[13:09:20] <black_warlock> -.-
[13:09:47] <Prog_101> How can I sort a date/time in to minutes hours seconds days...?
[13:10:12] <black_warlock> get a simple countdown script
[13:10:45] <black_warlock> the only parameters you have to set are the starts and the end
[13:11:50] <black_warlock> if you use dinamic lenguage
[13:12:12] <black_warlock> the start point can be the pubblication date and the end point its 5 mins later
[13:12:27] <black_warlock> can be automated
[13:12:30] <Prog_101> how should I add time
[13:13:10] <Prog_101> so $('.thing').click(function)
[13:13:20] <Prog_101> but with what
[13:14:23] <black_warlock> well you need to register something
[13:14:31] <black_warlock> you can use a simple cookie to do it
[13:14:44] <black_warlock> but then the timer will be different on each pc
[13:14:52] <Prog_101> no
[13:14:58] <black_warlock> if you dont use server side lenguage will be hard
[13:16:04] <Prog_101> would doing 100000 $.post functions a second ruin the browser?
[13:16:49] <BeWilled> which is beter? $.ajax or $.getJSON
[13:18:41] <GoSox> does jquery have anything good for data processing or is it all display stuff? I have a multi-line string that I want to loop through line by line, and do something with each line. Or even better, break the string into an array where each line is an item in the array
[13:19:36] <GoSox> too bad javascript doesn't have an unserialize function that i could use with php's serialize to pass complex data structures easily from language to language
[13:21:23] <Guest40893> Hey, I want to bind to mousemove for every element on the page (so that it will catch no matter what element its moving on), but I only want to callback to run once.
[13:21:28] <Guest40893> Solution?
[13:23:53] <knockknockimhere> just set a variable, change it to false, at page load... then when 1 of the callbacks is launched throw it on false.
[13:24:04] <Phiphel> BeWilled: it's the same, getJSON is just shorthand
[13:24:29] <nathggns> Yea, but then if the mouse moves /again/
[13:24:33] <nathggns> then it needs to be ran
[13:24:59] * nathggns wonders if it will work on $(window)
[13:25:03] <nathggns> or $(document)
[13:28:32] <hex``> When you click "Son", isn't it supposed to print only "Parent of Son is Parent" instead of "Parent of Son is Grandparent Parent Son"? The code: http://jsfiddle.net/jQD5B/
[13:28:32] <pindropper> I am trying to get the position of an element using position() or offset(). and then using left and top to overlay an element. Everything works, however the top and left that is detemined does not consider the padding and margin of the element. How do i do this in a generic way.?
[13:45:37] <Phiphel> hex``: No. Browsers will close p tags before opening a new one.
[13:45:52] <Phiphel> So you have siblings, not parents/children.
[13:46:22] <Phiphel> You should change it to spans or divs if you want to do that.
[13:47:25] <black_warlock> anyone pro here ?
[13:53:39] <BeWilled> Can you draw a circle using jquery?
[13:58:38] <Phiphel> BeWilled: No. But you can with JS or CSS, depending on the browser.
[13:59:10] <Phiphel> Or even easier with raphael.js
[14:09:03] <minna1> I'm back, still haven't managed the task.
[14:09:24] <minna1> So i e-mail the teacher and now i'm sure i won't do this on my own.
[14:09:25] <ravenzz> :o
[14:09:49] <ravenzz> didn't someone help you?
[14:10:55] <minna1> To do something different, sure.
[14:11:24] <ravenzz> eh k
[14:11:34] <minna1> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/wGRbp/
[14:12:26] <minna1> I managed to get it working if the button data-contains where not dynamic.
[14:13:27] <espressive> Apart from the syntax difference, should these not return the same? $("details").not("summary"); ::
[14:13:28] <espressive> $("details :not(summary)");
[14:13:54] <ravenzz> minna1 I'll take a look, hold on
[14:14:18] <minna1> ravenzz: I've got all night, i really appreciate ANY help right now.
[14:14:40] <tomoyuki28jp> When my users hover to a link of address, I want to show a pop-up window with google map. Can anybody teach me a easy way to do it?
[14:17:17] <RLa> i'm trying to construct a list of li's, my input is an object of errors in format "field":"error message", i would like to put all messages into a html list
[14:17:41] <RLa> now one way to do it is to build html by concatenating lof of strings
[14:18:01] <RLa> but i think i have seen less verbose variants
[14:19:03] <RLa> $some_function("</li>").magic() <- something like that, can someone help me to recall what construct it actually was?
[14:21:18] <Phiphel> RLa: Post some code. Hard to see what you mean by that.
[14:21:33] <Phiphel> tomoyuki28jp: I'm sure google has some map API you could use.
[14:21:58] <tomoyuki28jp> Phiphel: with the hover and pop-up window things?
[14:22:23] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/
[14:22:39] <Phiphel> tomoyuki28jp: yes. Or a perhaps a jQ plugin if you don't want to fiddle with it.
[14:22:57] <tomoyuki28jp> espressive: I've been using the API already.
[14:23:02] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, that will get you to create you map, and as far as showing on hover, you have two choices
[14:23:42] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, you can either render the map on DOM ready in a hidden DIV and then on hover, simpy show the DIV positioned appropriately using CSS or
[14:23:55] <RLa> Phiphel, http://pastebin.com/8b293e9r
[14:24:18] <espressive> depending on the common usage of your users, do not render until hover so
[14:24:38] <tomoyuki28jp> espressive: I understand what you mean. thanks for your help.
[14:24:43] <RLa> Phiphel, div class="errors" should have id="errors" as well
[14:24:45] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, inside the .hover(function(event) { //call map code });
[14:25:08] <RLa> Phiphel, in that div i want to create <ul> of error messages
[14:25:31] <tomoyuki28jp> espressive: I was actually looking for a easier way if exists like just rendering an iframe in a pop-up window with some parameters.
[14:25:51] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, and when your map is done, call show()
[14:26:27] <j0llyr0tten> i got a draggable div inside a dialog and i can't drag it off of the dialog box no matter what i do
[14:26:31] <RLa> Phiphel, errors are in data.errors, as field: message
[14:26:40] <j0llyr0tten> also i can's set buttons to draggable
[14:26:49] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, I suppose you could go that way, not a big fan of iFrames myself
[14:27:09] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, you might also want to look at a jQuery Google Maps plugin that might already do that
[14:27:43] <Phiphel> RLa: so data.errors is an array with just text? And you want that to be displayed as an ul?
[14:27:48] <tomoyuki28jp> espressive: thanks a lot for your help!
[14:27:55] <j0llyr0tten> anybody know how to enable dragging of elements beyond the bounding border of a dialog box that they're in???
[14:28:01] <espressive> tomoyuki28jp, this might help : http://addyosmani.com/blog/how-to-easily-add-a-google-map-using-jquery-and-an-address-in-less-than-5-minutes/
[14:28:15] <j0llyr0tten> i am completely stumped, been at it for hours and hours
[14:28:34] <RLa> Phiphel, almost, i can certanly turn messages into simple array from current field: message pairs
[14:29:19] <espressive> RLa, also concider JSON, your exampe is a prime candidate for JSON, from there you can easily and cleanly work with a JSON object, after parsing it of course
[14:29:27] <RLa> Phiphel, the question is more about constructing <ul> with <li> for each message
[14:29:41] <RLa> espressive, it's already json object
[14:29:48] <espressive> RLa, oh perfect
[14:30:06] <RLa> espressive, the data is not problem, constructing marku is
[14:30:08] <Phiphel> I'm not sure I'm understading the problem then. Can't you just for (var i in data.errors) append li with the text?
[14:30:33] <RLa> Phiphel, so isn't there some shortcut without using append?
[14:30:43] <RLa> and without for-loop?
[14:31:11] <Phiphel> You could turn it into html and just let Jq sort it out.
[14:31:19] <Phiphel> That would be two lines of code.
[14:31:28] <Phiphel> Or one...
[14:32:00] <RLa> now how do i turn it into html :)
[14:32:30] <Phiphel> I'd go: $("<ul>").html("<li>"+errors.join("</li><li>")+"</li").appendTo("body");
[14:32:56] <Phiphel> I'd go: $("<ul>").html("<li>"+errors.join("</li><li>")+"</li>").appendTo("body");
[14:32:58] <Phiphel> Even.
[14:33:05] <RLa> actually i think that was the code i was looking for :)
[14:33:08] <RLa> thanks
[14:33:11] <Phiphel> np
[14:33:42] <Phiphel> It does look more elegant than using a for and append, but I don't think it's better code.
[14:33:57] <Phiphel> Unless you'll never have to do any altercations to it, ever.
[14:34:01] <Phiphel> Just a fair warning.
[14:34:07] <agafdad> guys, where I can find good d3 tutorial? for mortals
[14:38:10] <GoSox> if i want to stick some text into an empty span, should I use .html() or should I use something else?
[14:38:31] <Phiphel> .html for html, .text for text.
[14:38:31] <minna> ravenzz: Any suggestions? :-S
[14:38:39] <GoSox> ah ok
[14:39:04] <GoSox> do both of those functions replace waht's already in the item? (as opposed to appending it)?
[14:39:10] <Phiphel> Yes.
[14:40:10] <j0llyr0tten> hello people! any idea at all why i can't drag a draggable() element off of a containing dialog?
[14:40:34] <Phiphel> Using jQ UI?
[14:40:38] <j0llyr0tten> yes
[14:40:46] <j0llyr0tten> 1.8.16
[14:41:01] <GoSox> do you guys have fights with the people in #javascript?
[14:41:18] <Phiphel> Have you set the containment?
[14:41:26] <j0llyr0tten> yes, to window
[14:41:32] <j0llyr0tten> and to document
[14:41:37] <j0llyr0tten> neither work
[14:41:55] <j0llyr0tten> the element vanishes under the border on the left and top
[14:41:59] <Phiphel> Do you have some CSS that might mess it up?
[14:42:04] <GoSox> Phiphel: so if i want to delete the text from an element, i jsut do .text(''); (an empty string) ?
[14:42:08] <GoSox> or is there another way
[14:42:15] <j0llyr0tten> and causes scrolling on the right and bottom
[14:42:23] <Phiphel> No. That would return the text.
[14:42:28] <Phiphel> You do: .empty()
[14:42:38] <espressive> GoSox, you can also use the .empty() function
[14:42:49] <Phiphel> Well. Not return it. But use empty. :)
[14:42:55] <j0llyr0tten> i don't think i have any css that is interfering, it looks like the standard behaviour
[14:42:56] <espressive> empty is the much beter option
[14:43:15] <JohnnyCruz> Hi, trying to use fancybox to open a scribd doc, am i missing something? http://jsfiddle.net/CLMxE/
[14:43:41] <Phiphel> j0llyr0tten, hard to tell what could be wrong when I can't see it, but it sounds like you might have some overflow:hidden or something in there.
[14:45:44] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: i'll check, it's just the regular jQ UI css stuff
[14:48:26] <sanguisdex> can any one recomend a clean horizontal accordion lib?
[14:49:45] <hex``> When you click "Son", isn't it supposed to print only "Parent of Son is Parent" instead of "Parent of Son is Grandparent Parent Son"? The code: http://jsfiddle.net/jQD5B/
[14:49:46] <GoSox> are there any included animation functions (like .hide() or slideDown() ) that do only width changing? I have a progress bar i want to slide in from the side only. hide('slow') gets me very close to the effect i want, but not quite
[14:49:59] <Phiphel> hex`` I already answered that.
[14:50:03] <Phiphel> Look up.
[14:50:25] <Phiphel> GoSox: animate()
[14:51:00] <Altreus> Can I ask about jquery tools in here? http://jsfiddle.net/K7xRf/  <-- this works fine as a fiddle, but intermittently as an HTML file and I can't work out why. Most of the time the overlay thing doesn't show at all, and you can see that those times it doesn't get the CSS display:block
[14:51:49] <Altreus> Wondered whether someone else could try it for me. I tried Chrome and Firefox, only in Firefox it doesn't show the overlay at all
[14:52:02] <eddiemonge> Altreus: do any errors show up in the console?
[14:52:35] <Altreus> eddiemonge: none at all :(
[14:52:40] <eddiemonge> Altreus: and error isnt a valid tag. i think you forgot a period
[14:52:58] <Altreus> ah yeah :)
[14:53:07] <eddiemonge> also, do you know if jquery tools works with 1.7?
[14:53:19] <Altreus> Shall I try with an older version?
[14:53:30] <Altreus> It's just, the fiddle uses 1.7 so I figured it would
[14:54:23] <Altreus> eddiemonge: Hrm, works consistently with 1.6.4
[14:54:30] <Altreus> I wonder why the fiddle works fine
[14:54:41] <eddiemonge> means something else is going on with your page
[14:54:56] <Altreus> I pasted the HTML verbatim
[14:55:21] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: ok, so dialog() wraps its div in another div and sets overflow to hidden
[14:55:28] <Altreus> To isolate any other CSS or JS you see
[14:56:05] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: if i overridee that am i going to (a) mess with the jQ UI dialog logic? and (b) what is the way to go about that?
[14:56:14] <jwm> heh, chrome started to ignore my main.js file
[14:56:18] <jwm> any changes to it
[14:56:23] <jwm> I had to rename it to newmain.js
[14:56:24] <jwm> ;)
[14:56:29] <eddiemonge> Altreus: live link?
[14:56:39] <Phiphel> j0llyr0tten: Append whatever you're dragging to the body and not the box.
[14:56:41] <rosieres> this is more a general JS question. Is it possible to produce a keypress value on a onclick event ?
[14:56:48] <Altreus> eddiemonge: easy enough, give me a tick
[14:56:48] <espressive> jwn, Chrome can be harsh on caching
[14:57:20] <jwm> espressive: I moved the file, moved it back, touched it, removed the script tag, put it back
[14:57:24] <jwm> it still kept the old version
[14:57:29] <jwm> never had that happen before
[14:57:30] <jwm> heh
[14:57:44] <espressive> jwm, that's rough ;)
[14:57:48] <jwm> I was coding in the file and nothing was changing so I was like wtf lol
[14:57:58] <Phiphel> jwm: do you refresh the page with ctlr+f5 in chrome?
[14:58:03] <jwm> ctrl+r
[14:58:06] <Altreus> eddiemonge: http://grammarpolice.co.uk/test.html
[14:58:11] <jwm> I even closed the window and opened it again
[14:58:11] <Altreus> that's the 1.7 version
[14:58:31] <jwm> I restarted apache
[14:58:31] <jwm> etc
[14:58:44] <RLa> how to say in more concise way: $("#contact input").removeClass("error"); $("#contact textarea").removeClass("error");
[14:58:48] <eddiemonge> Altreus: jquery isnt loaded
[14:59:05] <RLa> can i combine input and textarea into single selector?
[14:59:10] <Altreus> huh i don't get that locally
[14:59:17] <Altreus> That's interesting
[14:59:20] <Phiphel> RLa: .add()
[14:59:22] <espressive> RLa, yes you can
[14:59:45] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: i'm creating a kind of floating toolbox, so i need the tools in the toolbox (the dialog) not attached to the body
[14:59:49] <eddiemonge> Altreus: it doesnt look like its on google cdn yet
[14:59:53] <GoSox> does javascript have a function like PHP's number_format( )? (for among other things, adding thousands separators to large numbers as strings
[14:59:57] <Altreus> ta for the second pair of eyes :)
[15:00:07] <Altreus> I wonder what i've done differently here
[15:00:25] <Altreus> Looks like I jumped the gun on 1.7
[15:01:01] <Phiphel> j0llyr0tten: So you want to drag something from the toolbox outside of the toolbox?
[15:01:09] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: correct!
[15:01:26] <jwm> RLa: "#contact input, #contact textarea"
[15:01:37] <rosieres> Is it possible to simulate a keypress by an onclick event ?
[15:01:38] <Altreus> ta :)
[15:01:39] <espressive> RLa, $("#contact").find("input, textarea").removeClass("error");
[15:01:56] <jwm> yeah or the find ^^^^
[15:01:57] <RLa> nice
[15:02:00] <RLa> thanks
[15:02:17] <espressive> RLa, http://jsfiddle.net/mqswN/
[15:02:47] <RLa> i actually have label too :)
[15:03:43] <RLa> it works very well
[15:04:18] <Phiphel> j0llyr0tten: Well sounds like you have some structural issues. Without having the thing infront of me; I'd say use a handle for the UI or append the draggable box outside the elem with the overflow.
[15:04:33] <eddiemonge> ?eval []
[15:04:37] <bot-t> eddiemonge: []
[15:04:45] <hex``> Phiphel sorry, I didnt see your answer before
[15:04:57] <eddiemonge> ?eval if ( [] ) { true; } else { false; }
[15:04:58] <Phiphel> np
[15:05:00] <bot-t> eddiemonge: true
[15:06:09] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: handle?
[15:06:29] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: i tried ... $('#toolbox').parent().css('overflow','visible') ... no joy
[15:06:46] <Phiphel> I ment to say; helpers.
[15:07:12] <hex``> Is there a good place to understand tag hierarchy? How would I know browsers close p tags before opening new ones?
[15:07:28] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: maybe yeah, i'm using 'clone', maybe i'll try a helper :) i'll let you know
[15:08:04] <Phiphel> hex``: perhaps w3schools has something on it. But it's just one of those legacy things...
[15:08:11] <espressive> RLa, this one will find all elements inside the contact container and remove the error class if it exists :
[15:08:12] <espressive> $("#contact").find("*").removeClass("error");
[15:08:57] <espressive> RLa, depending on the amount of DOM elements inside your contact container that might get expensive though
[15:11:02] <espressive> RLa, another options setting the context for the selector expression : $("*", "#contact").removeClass("error");
[15:14:49] <Guest5801> hi, my $.ajax() function write for example "<div id="test" >hello</div>" on a page1.php.  In page1.php, a js should manage the id "test", but the added div is not visible by the page's js. How can i made visible by the js the added div? thanks
[15:16:49] <eddiemonge> ?delegate @ Guest5801
[15:16:50] <bot-t> Guest5801, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:17:32] <Guest5801> great, i will try it!!!!! thanks a lot! :)
[15:17:38] <hex``> Phiphel ok, ty again
[15:18:57] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: helper does not do the trick, just has the same behaviour but with different html :)
[15:19:17] <j0llyr0tten> Phiphel: i'll figure something out, don't you worry
[15:21:13] <j0llyr0tten> i dunno why setting the dialog's overflow to visible doesn't do the trick :(
[15:21:42] <[1]jon> I'm trying to do a ajax post but I can't get the url .. I use something like url: "localhost/login" and it ends up being localhost/%5Bobject
[15:22:06] <[1]jon> in the call it is converting the path to objects.. what gives?
[15:22:54] <j0llyr0tten> oh it did! i just have to set it on both containing divs, doh!
[15:24:25] <Guest5801> eddiemonge thanks a lot, it works :)
[15:25:02] <j0llyr0tten> so that just leaves my second question, any idea why setting a button() to draggable() does not work? ... anybody got any ideas? or should i just leave it alone?
[15:31:54] <[1]jon> isn't it a bit odd to make a button draggable?  how would you click on it to move it?
[15:35:57] <j0llyr0tten> [1]jon: i know yeah, dumb right? forget i said it, i just liked the styling of it and wanted to use it
[15:36:36] <[1]jon> you could put a div around the button or something and make that draggable
[15:37:17] <[1]jon> although I missed the start of the conversation so I have no idea what you are doing
[15:39:09] <j0llyr0tten> [1]jon: that's exactly what i'm going to do :) i'm going to have a dialog box acting as a toolbox filled with button like things you can drag onto the page
[15:39:33] <[1]jon> sounds cool
[15:39:43] <j0llyr0tten> [1]jon: you have a weird name just in case you hadn't noticed,
[15:40:05] <[1]jon> yah its the irc program I'm using.. it just appends [] to my name when there is a name conflict
[15:40:06] <j0llyr0tten> i hope it's going to be cool, it's just a little demo but it might turn out nice
[15:44:35] <j0llyr0tten> [1]jon: i'll throw it up onto Github when I'm done. I'm using Camping and jQuery, a great combo
[15:45:50] <[1]jon> don't know anything about camping :(
[15:46:47] <hex``> What's the correct way to SELECT all divs with id="title"? I tried $("div #title").hover(function() { but it didn't worked out
[15:47:30] <hex``> with only $("#title"), works... but that's not what I want
[15:50:15] <[1]jon> any reason using are using many divs with the same name instead of a class?
[15:51:07] <[1]jon> *same id name
[15:51:31] <opra> i create a collection like this: var targets = $('p:lt(50)'); How do i use this collection? For instance, i like to do a .replaceWith on the 12th item of the collection. How do i do that?
[15:51:51] <hex``> [1]jon, no, I'm just in learning process, I actually don't have more than one div with same id
[15:52:39] <j0llyr0tten> hex``: maybe using a class is simpler as [1]jon says, to start off with, and do more complex selections as you need them
[15:54:14] <[1]jon> you're id's should be unique
[15:54:35] <hex``> hmm ok...
[15:54:53] <[1]jon> I think your selector should work but try it with a class instead of ids
[15:54:54] <hex``> I thought ids should be unique for each tag, meaning a div can have the same id as a ul tag..
[15:55:04] <hex``> should -> could
[15:56:11] <[1]jon> no an Id should be unique within the page
[15:56:54] <hex``> cool, thanks
[15:58:49] <ryanneufeld> [1]jon: you're == you are
[15:59:23] <[1]jon> yah your right thanks :)
[16:00:24] <dancole> How do I get the selection box that typically appears when a user holds down the mouse and moves the cursor for selectable?
[16:01:11] <afeijo> hi guys
[16:02:15] <afeijo> I'm using Drupal 7, drupal has an API that can automatically set an autocomplete field for me, it works fine except when I load my form thru AJAX, then the autocomplete does not get properly initated (bind() ? ). How can I force it?
[16:04:23] <eddiemonge> afeijo: use delegate
[16:04:42] <afeijo> eddiemonge, no idea what it means, time to google...
[16:04:53] <eddiemonge> ?delegate @ afeijo
[16:04:54] <bot-t> afeijo, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:05:15] <afeijo> hmmmm I see, but the jquery code that make the autocomplete works aint mine! it wont be easy...
[16:05:24] <SerpentX> hi
[16:05:37] <SerpentX> anyone know the channel for django forms
[16:06:20] <SerpentX> autocomplete isn't bad
[16:07:04] <eddiemonge> #django maybe?
[16:07:59] <eddiemonge> afeijo: drupal doesnt come with an autocomplete out of the box i think. what are you using to generate it?
[16:07:59] <SerpentX> Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[16:08:14] <SerpentX> does that mean register
[16:08:54] <eddiemonge> sure
[16:10:47] <SerpentX> Anyone in here know how to have one combobox filter another combo box in django form from model?
[16:12:04] <coldhead> i bet #django knows
[16:12:25] <SerpentX> k...in that case
[16:12:29] <SerpentX> how do i register on here again
[16:12:49] <eddiemonge>   /msg nickserv help
[16:14:01] <SerpentX> jeez..needs real email
[16:14:16] <SerpentX> god, who auths their real email on irc
[16:14:35] <SerpentX> and they want a donation
[16:14:50] <SerpentX> u'd think selling my email address to the koreans was enough
[16:15:07] <eddiemonge> then dont register
[16:15:36] <SerpentX> oh just appreciate my humour
[16:16:00] <afeijo> eddiemonge, drupal has it for over 4 years, since version 5 (maybe even before). You do it thru the Form API, with array('#autocomplete_path' => '/url/for/your/handler'); That is all
[16:16:23] <eddiemonge> afeijo: thats php for the backend. whats handling the frontend?
[16:16:33] <afeijo> eddiemonge, jquery
[16:17:04] <afeijo> eddiemonge, that is the problem, drupal has its own jquery for the autocomplete, I dont know how to call its jquery function. Digging it thru drupal core
[16:19:35] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a good guide to get html5 drag and drop uploads to work?
[16:20:02] <coldhead> you read dive into html5?
[16:20:08] <ryanneufeld> by getting it to work, I mean, a how to actually do it
[16:20:27] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: miss me?
[16:20:34] <coldhead> i would bone up on DIHTML5 then i would ask nlogax
[16:20:59] <coldhead> i missed you like i miss my wisdom teeth, ryanneufeld
[16:21:11] <coldhead> massively overgrown, detached, floating around my brain someplace
[16:21:26] <ryanneufeld> oic
[16:22:40] <sylow-> Hi, I was thinking, is it actually possible to reload a div without some time Interval. Thus pushing data to the browser from an external event (like a GET request on another url) ?
[16:25:08] <sylow-> like ie.: when you have an url path /some/view in your browser, which gets refreshed if there's a hit on /another/script/
[16:27:50] <coldhead> you want the illfated websockets, sylow-
[16:27:59] <coldhead> which i think are abandoned presently
[16:28:02] <coldhead> in most browsers
[16:29:08] <coldhead> in conclusion, if you need it to work everywhere i think you have to poll
[16:29:13] <sylow-> hmm, that's a new term for me coldhead
[16:29:14] <coldhead> in the client
[16:29:18] <sylow-> yes, probably
[16:29:43] <sylow-> I'm aware of forking processes to do server side stuff, but that doesn't involve Browser behaviour
[16:29:57] <coldhead> hmm, apparently the websockets API spec is still being updated
[16:30:06] <coldhead> so it will happen eventually
[16:30:19] <coldhead> can you hold off on your project for 5-10 years?
[16:30:45] <sylow-> it's not such a big deal, I was just wondering :) I'll stick to polling the data, but many thanks on your input coldhead
[16:30:57] <sylow-> pulling
[16:31:19] <aaronmcadam> node node node
[16:31:30] <aaronmcadam> socket socket socket iiiiioooooo
[16:31:59] <coldhead> node as the news
[16:32:07] <aaronmcadam> news as the node
[16:32:16] <coldhead> node descending staircase
[16:32:19] <coldhead> live node girls
[16:32:20] <coldhead> etc
[16:34:04] <eddiemonge> sylow-: look into comet
[16:34:16] <coldhead> is that still a thing?
[16:35:07] <eddiemonge> i dont think its died off
[16:35:11] <aaronmcadam> nope
[16:36:08] <aaronmcadam> http://html5homi.es/
[16:36:23] <sylow-> interesting tip eddiemonge , thanks
[16:36:39] <aaronmcadam> what's your stack sylow-
[16:36:56] <sylow-> what do you mean by stack aaronmcadam ?
[16:37:12] <aaronmcadam> set of technologies you use for webdev
[16:38:07] <sylow-> ah, PHP and MySQL (sometimes a framework or a CMS system)
[16:38:23] <aaronmcadam> kk
[16:38:26] <sylow-> with jquery of course, but only when needed
[16:38:44] <Kindari> So does .stop() not stop .delay calls? inside a event callback ive got $element.stop(true).show().delay(15000).hide(); - what  it is doing is still hiding after multiple clicks which id like to stop and reset to hiden 15 seconds after the last click, resetting on each additional click.
[16:39:20] <aaronmcadam> sylow-: http://jsjoy.com/blog/197/simple-php-comet-example
[16:39:55] <aaronmcadam> bloody hell that code sucks
[16:40:27] <aaronmcadam> sylow-: what problem are you trying to solve anyway
[16:41:16] <sylow-> aaronmcadam: nothing at the moment, I was planning some code & application flow for a future project
[16:42:11] <aaronmcadam> ok?
[16:42:17] <sylow-> aaronmcadam: the situation would be, that I have to be notified in the browser of some events (which are triggered from an external event, by an http request)
[16:42:31] <sylow-> it's pretty easy to do with polling the data
[16:42:32] <aaronmcadam> ok cool
[16:42:57] <sylow-> but maybe there is some other way to do it
[16:42:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah but you could try socket.io
[16:43:07] <aaronmcadam> it falls back to ajax if needed
[16:43:16] <sylow-> sounds cool
[16:43:22] <aaronmcadam> it's node tho
[16:43:26] <Bearcat> hello folks. I'm *very* new to jquery. I have a site at http://safety-kit.feline-soul.net/privacy.php There is an animated nav trick that i took from here: http://css-tricks.com/5582-jquery-magicline-navigation/ It works great except that the navline does not stay on the current page. In the comments on 2/10/10 pintus gives code on how to do that, but i'm new enough that i don't know where that code is supposed to be inserted. I'd love some 
[16:43:42] <Tatsh> lol css tricks
[16:43:51] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[16:43:53] <Tatsh> if it involves jquery it's no longer css, nor is it a trick, it's a hack
[16:43:55] <aaronmcadam> coyier is awesome
[16:43:59] <Bearcat> Tatsh: ha!
[16:44:58] <sylow-> Thanks for your input everyone, I need some sleep now, laters
[16:45:34] <Bearcat> for the record, i'm *not* using wordpress
[16:46:00] <aaronmcadam> good for u l;ol
[16:46:36] <Bearcat> aaronmcadam: i feel it's better for me to learn all this stuff, by not starting with a template system.
[16:46:43] <Tatsh> i can't believe his poll; over 2 MB is okay for modern web design?
[16:46:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm?
[16:46:51] <Tatsh> wow no wonder the internet sucks
[16:47:03] <Tatsh> every average site takes over 2 seconds to load; that is not acceptable
[16:47:54] <aaronmcadam> looks like 500k is leading
[16:48:04] <aaronmcadam> still pretty high
[16:48:13] <aaronmcadam> depending on image content I guess
[16:48:49] <Tatsh> i went for 350k
[16:49:34] <aaronmcadam> the website itself is 611.2K
[16:49:58] <aaronmcadam> of which 474 is js
[16:50:01] <aaronmcadam> that's silly
[16:50:15] <aaronmcadam> some unminified stuff
[16:50:55] <ichi_> hallo, so I think I have a jquery issue
[16:51:07] <ichi_> or something weird is going on
[16:51:12] <ichi_> http://scratchpostvfx.com/hosted/sp0267
[16:51:37] <ichi_> when I click on a navigation option, the page jumps up
[16:52:02] <aaronmcadam> yucky
[16:52:19] <aaronmcadam> there's absolutely no need for that nav to be ajaxified
[16:52:27] <Tatsh> 474 in JS?!
[16:52:34] <aaronmcadam> not to mention those "links" are just divs
[16:52:41] <Tatsh> i thought the site i made at 137 KB in JS was heavy enough
[16:52:44] <Tatsh> 60 KB gzip'd
[16:52:50] <aaronmcadam> I think he's gzipping
[16:53:00] <Tatsh> so it's even more?
[16:53:04] <aaronmcadam> I think it's the unzipped version Yslow is telling me about
[16:53:23] <ichi_> so, is there a reason this would happen ?
[16:53:30] <Tatsh> it's nice to have new features; i hope he uess a CDN and enjoys paying high bandwidth bills
[16:53:49] <coldhead> can anyone kill me?
[16:53:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah i was right Tatsh
[16:53:59] <aaronmcadam> the actual download is 100k
[16:54:29] <aaronmcadam> nope
[16:54:30] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:54:37] <aaronmcadam> that was cuz I'd cached most of the js
[16:54:41] <aaronmcadam> it *is* 631
[16:54:53] <ichi_> clicking a menu option shouldn't make the page jump up
[16:55:06] <Tatsh> ugh is he servering jquery himself?
[16:55:10] <aaronmcadam> nope
[16:55:11] <Tatsh> does he minify/compile?
[16:55:25] <Tatsh> page speed gives this a red 60/100 rating
[16:55:35] <Tatsh> i bet YSlow would do the same, F
[16:55:40] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:55:47] <aaronmcadam> no it's C
[16:56:20] <Tatsh> well it's wordpress; i honestly don't blame the author; i blame WordPress
[16:56:33] <Tatsh> their code is absolute crap; efficiency is an afterthought
[16:56:49] <NewWaveofTrolls> Madonna in all her beauty: http://www.madonnashots.com/mo7903.jpg
[16:57:01] <ichi_> anyone have any ideas why this would happen please ?
[16:57:27] <aaronmcadam> ah theres' probably reasons
[16:57:39] <ichi_> naturally :p
[16:57:41] <aaronmcadam> Chris is one of the most respected guys online so
[16:58:04] <aaronmcadam> ichi_: your nav won't work without js u know
[16:58:12] <ichi_> I know
[16:58:16] <ichi_> not the issue currently :p
[16:58:18] <aaronmcadam> why is it even ajaxed?
[16:58:24] <aaronmcadam> there's no need at all for that
[16:58:40] <ichi_> hover doesn't work and I'm using jquery load
[16:58:47] <aaronmcadam> your navbar isn't even a list of links
[16:59:01] <ichi_> yes, I'm aware of that, I tried setting them as links but it broke flexbox
[16:59:47] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[16:59:57] <aaronmcadam> dammit man, you've got a lot to learn
[17:00:19] <ichi_> … okay
[17:00:45] <aaronmcadam> make sure your website works without js, navigation is fundamental u know
[17:00:48] <ichi_> there is a lot I don't know, I make no excuse for that
[17:00:53] * Bearcat *really* needs to go though PageSpee and speed up his page
[17:01:05] <ichi_> but I would appreciate a suggestion as to why my current problem is so
[17:01:10] <ichi_> and what I can do to fix it
[17:01:19] <ichi_> rather than get my ass kicked over my approach :(
[17:01:28] <aaronmcadam> haha but you're wasting your time
[17:01:37] <ichi_> it's my time :p
[17:01:41] <aaronmcadam> move onto some other part that will actually add to the UX
[17:01:58] <Kindari> is it possible to cancel a .delay()
[17:02:17] <aaronmcadam> Kindari: just use setTimeout and clearTimeout
[17:04:08] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, nah you could totally have all javascript website and tell the non-js paranoids to leave up front
[17:04:21] <Tatsh> and let social networking handle how your site gets popular on google
[17:04:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah and screw accessibility and semantics :)
[17:04:54] <Tatsh> accessibility doesnt' involve javascript? it's 2011, sir
[17:04:54] <aaronmcadam> who cares about them anyway right
[17:05:04] <Tatsh> jquery UI adds aria tags to everything
[17:05:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know that
[17:05:20] <ichi_> you guys are in jquery, surely a lack of javascript support would be evil ! ;)
[17:05:24] <ichi_> SO
[17:05:27] <Tatsh> disable javascript; go to twitter.com
[17:05:36] <ichi_> why would clicking a menu option make my page jump up ?
[17:05:41] <aaronmcadam> just cuz twitter do it doesn't mean it's right
[17:05:47] <aaronmcadam> and twitter is an app, not a website
[17:05:50] <Tatsh> twitter DOES add aria tags to everything too
[17:06:04] <Tatsh> i'm just a little bit surprised there's no message or anything on the page to indicate what to fix
[17:06:10] <aaronmcadam> there's no need to ajaxify simple content pages
[17:06:19] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, but it looks awesome when you do it right
[17:06:26] <aaronmcadam> haha right
[17:06:31] <Tatsh> here's what i did for my site; tabs (like ul of course)
[17:06:42] <Tatsh> the tabs themselves, ul li a href="/normalpage"
[17:06:49] <aaronmcadam> fading in content is annoying anyway
[17:06:56] <aaronmcadam> if the delay is too high
[17:07:18] <Tatsh> but $('nav a').click(function (event) { /* load tab content, change sytles, etc; really this is done via hash change */ event.preventDefault(); return false });
[17:07:37] <aaronmcadam> ...
[17:07:52] <Tatsh> i'm using the jQuery bbq plugin to do hashchange; it works pretty good except for IE 7 it's slow as anything
[17:08:14] <ichi_> that's what I'm doing, even trying the preventDefault() call too, but has no effect
[17:08:30] <Tatsh> this makes back/forward still work as expected, aaronmcadam
[17:08:42] <Tatsh> and i HATE when sites that do ajax navigation do NOT do that
[17:08:47] <aaronmcadam> duh
[17:08:53] <aaronmcadam> I know all about bbq
[17:09:07] <Tatsh> there are more flash sites that do navigation properly with back/forward then there are ones in JS
[17:09:20] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, since i never touch href attribute, google may still crawl my site
[17:10:15] <Tatsh> google does execute some javascript but i doubt it would execute that; i think there are some common errors that the google bot tries to run through (like the old sites where <select> element was used to navigate via js)
[17:10:48] <ichi_> I'd prefer not to have an href too, as there's no point with jquery .load
[17:10:56] <ichi_> I'm also using that instead of php include
[17:11:03] <ichi_> because I don't want the entire page to reload
[17:11:05] <Tatsh> uh ichi_ you do want href
[17:11:05] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[17:11:14] <aaronmcadam> you *need* a href for the click event
[17:11:39] <ichi_> please explain
[17:11:42] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:11:47] <Tatsh> ichi_, make the site work first without JS at all
[17:11:54] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ ichi_
[17:11:55] <bot-t> ichi_, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[17:11:56] <Tatsh> well, at least navigation
[17:12:25] <ichi_> again, you're complaining about my chosen approach
[17:12:31] <ichi_> I appreciate what you're saying, I do
[17:12:33] <aaronmcadam> and you're not listening
[17:12:47] <ichi_> but that's not the problem
[17:13:13] <ichi_> so I would appreciate suggestions on how to fix my current problem
[17:13:25] <ichi_> and at a later time, if I choose to do so, I may choose my approach
[17:13:59] <ichi_> change, rather
[17:14:27] <Tatsh> i'm changing my Loading ... text to a throbber
[17:14:44] <Tatsh> people don't think it's doing nothing when there's no animation <-- Apple HIG
[17:14:48] <Tatsh> lol
[17:16:33] <ichi_> I have limited time, I am forced to take approaches that I know work because I've done this before
[17:16:43] <ichi_> but the page jumping on click is a new problem I have not faced before
[17:16:53] <aaronmcadam> ?stopPropagation @ ichi_
[17:16:54] <bot-t> ichi_, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[17:17:30] <aaronmcadam> it's not that difficult or time consuming to do your job right
[17:18:44] * Bearcat waits patiently for his chance to be assisted
[17:19:15] <ichi_> thank you aaronmcadam, unfortunately that didn't fix it
[17:19:28] <aaronmcadam> course it didnt :D
[17:20:20] <cornfeed> is there a way to get jquery to parse another website's text?
[17:20:58] <aaronmcadam> do u mean pull in another websites' content using ajax?
[17:21:07] <cornfeed> i guess
[17:21:14] <aaronmcadam> ?
[17:21:16] <cornfeed> i mean, yes
[17:21:22] <aaronmcadam> ?sop @ cornfeed
[17:21:22] <bot-t> cornfeed, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[17:21:29] <aaronmcadam> ?sop workarounds : cornfeed
[17:21:30] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Couldn't find "sop workarounds : cornfeed" in jQuery Docs.
[17:21:37] <aaronmcadam> ?sop workarounds @ cornfeed

[17:22:01] <aaronmcadam> so there u go
[17:22:16] <aaronmcadam> it's not as straight forward as u think but it is possible
[17:22:21] <aaronmcadam> YQL is easy
[17:23:50] <aaronmcadam> cornfeed: https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/jquery-yql/
[17:24:04] <ichi_> maybe I'll need to rebuild this with li's and a's
[17:24:19] <cornfeed> all of these workarounds wont really work for what i need. thanks
[17:24:23] <ichi_> :hover didn't work in firefox
[17:24:26] <aaronmcadam> what do u need then
[17:24:47] <cornfeed> is there a way to parse content from an iframe?
[17:25:09] <aaronmcadam> what exactly do u mean
[17:25:38] <aaronmcadam> what sort of content
[17:26:14] <cornfeed> for example, i want the user to type in a band and get the moods from allmusic.com. but i dont want it to be my ip, i want it to be each visitors.
[17:27:31] <terrysutton> Hey all— I want to add a "position: fixed" to a nav bar when I scroll down the page. I can't  get this code to work:
[17:27:33] <terrysutton> 		$('#nav').scroll(function() {
[17:27:34] <terrysutton> 		    if(this.offset.top <= 100) {
[17:27:34] <terrysutton> 		        $('#nav').css('position','fixed');
[17:27:34] <terrysutton> 		    }
[17:27:34] <terrysutton>   		});
[17:27:41] <terrysutton> help?
[17:27:47] <cornfeed> aaronmcadam: similar to crazedlist.org my ip will be banned if i create that much traffic
[17:27:47] <aaronmcadam> right u lost me on the "my ip" bit cornfeed
[17:28:00] <aaronmcadam> right
[17:28:08] <aaronmcadam> do allmusic have an api?
[17:28:11] <cornfeed> terrysutton: pastebin
[17:28:43] <cornfeed> aaronmcadam: allmusic does happen to have an api, but it was just an example, the site i will be parsing does not offer api
[17:29:00] <terrysutton> quite right @cornfeed, sorry:   http://pastebin.com/QmM6SvSf
[17:29:33] <aaronmcadam> terrysutton: this is what u want: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/fixed-floating-elements/
[17:30:19] <aaronmcadam> quite similar to your code but the tutorial explains it, you need more CSS to control things terracotta
[17:30:20] <terrysutton> aaronmcadam: exactly!  Thanks a million
[17:30:22] <aaronmcadam> terrysutton:
[17:30:42] <aaronmcadam> it's actually CSS that will fix ur problem terrysutton
[17:30:54] <aaronmcadam> positioning context
[17:31:13] <terrysutton> but I need to apply the CSS with query?
[17:31:15] <terrysutton> jquery
[17:31:30] <aaronmcadam> you apply and remove the fixed rule
[17:31:41] <terrysutton> right.
[17:31:42] <aaronmcadam> with js yes, but you need css
[17:31:54] <aaronmcadam> in your stylesheet, the video will explain it
[17:31:56] <ichi_> okay, the navigation is now rewritten with <a>'s and the page still jumps - any ideas ?
[17:36:00] <ichi_> it doesn't do it if the window is big enough to not need to scroll
[17:36:45] <elitekmnea> je

[17:37:41] <cornfeed> aaronmcadam: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067029/getting-around-same-origin-policy-in-javascript-without-server-side-scripts
[17:38:22] <aaronmcadam> yes jsonp
[17:38:30] <SerpentX> anyone know django forms?
[17:38:34] <aaronmcadam> a bit
[17:39:12] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue
[17:40:44] <cornfeed> easyXDM
[17:40:49] <ichi_> so I guess it's jquery load causing this issue
[17:41:22] <ichi_> I'll need to go back to the web 1.0 method of using links :p
[17:41:33] <aaronmcadam> thank fuck for that
[17:41:44] <ichi_> so much for the future :(
[17:42:44] <ziggles> If i have a string that's a big list of elements, can i use a jquery selector on it?
[17:43:04] <aaronmcadam> what's the string ziggles
[17:44:01] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: it's basically a collection of spans and brs that is the result of some other preprocessing.  I'd like to grab some stuff out of it w/o inserting it into the dom, if that's possible
[17:44:33] <aaronmcadam> right
[17:44:53] <Bearcat> so can someone help me figure out where to stick this Jquery code?
[17:45:27] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: sorry if that answer was unclear... I'm new to this stuff so i'm not sure if that is exactly what you were asking of me
[17:45:43] <Bearcat> i'm sure it's a simple thing, i just don't know JQ enoug to adapt the code i have
[17:46:10] <ziggles> One idea i had was to use .html() on it, then select against that?
[17:46:18] <aaronmcadam> it depends
[17:46:34] <aaronmcadam> if it's just a string, you'll need to wrap jQ around it to create the dom elements
[17:46:42] <aaronmcadam> if u want to select stuff from it
[17:47:00] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: so that means it would actually be inserted into the dom, somewhere?
[17:47:05] <aaronmcadam> n
[17:47:07] <aaronmcadam> no
[17:47:14] <aaronmcadam> creates DOM fragment
[17:47:22] <ziggles> ahhh
[17:48:03] <aaronmcadam> you have to actually call append() or something similar to insert it
[17:48:25] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DocumentFragment is what you are referring to, right?
[17:48:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's what $('<div>') does internally
[17:49:06] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: i just want to select a few elements, do my thing with them, then send them back tot he server -- it will never be inserted back into the dom (if ic an avoid it)
[17:49:18] <aaronmcadam> k
[17:49:18] <ziggles> sounds like... i just need to create that DocumentFragment, then use jQ on it to grab what i want
[17:49:22] <aaronmcadam> you can still select from it
[17:49:23] <ziggles> thanks a lot man
[17:49:28] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to insert it
[17:49:33] <ziggles> got it.
[17:49:35] <ziggles> thanks a lot man
[17:49:37] <ziggles> im gonna give it a shot
[17:49:47] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to use Doc Fragment, just $( ... )
[17:50:22] <ziggles> ah ok
[17:50:44] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: side Q... any idea what happens if you wrap up invalid html?  like that div you posted
[17:51:02] <aaronmcadam> that div i posted is valid
[17:51:26] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ ziggles
[17:51:26] <bot-t> ziggles, Try It And See
[17:51:53] <ziggles> lol
[17:51:59] <ziggles> ok
[17:52:18] <ziggles> ?tellaaronilltryitmyself
[17:52:19] <bot-t> ziggles, Couldn't find "tellaaronilltryitmyself" in jQuery Docs.
[17:52:24] <ziggles> damn didnt know it
[17:53:03] <aaronmcadam> ?tell ziggles to learn how to use bot-t ;)
[17:53:03] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Okay.
[17:53:23] <ziggles> LOL
[17:53:23] <bot-t> (20 secs ago) <aaronmcadam> tell ziggles to learn how to use bot-t ;)
[17:53:35] <coldhead> ?abuse @ aaronmcadam
[17:53:35] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Please don't abuse the bot in the channel. If you're testing things, please talk to him in a /query. If you're testing us, think again.
[17:53:50] <aaronmcadam> shh coldhead
[17:54:07] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[17:54:07] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[17:54:12] <aaronmcadam> see, he likes me :)
[17:54:51] * coldhead hugs bot-t
[17:54:51] * bot-t hugs coldhead back
[17:55:14] <coldhead> see, this is why suicide is not the answer
[17:55:54] <tmayr> so if i feel lonely and sucidal i can just come and hug the bot?, hes here for me?
[17:55:54] <tmayr> :P
[17:56:21] <coldhead> always
[17:56:28] <coldhead> subject to connectivity
[17:56:32] <tmayr> hah
[18:02:27] <Doomhammer> anyone know why, when inserting things into the DOM in IE8, the elements become garbled (i.e., firebug lists a few <div jquery12347823478934798="56"> elements), when they work in Firefox/Chrome/*?
[18:02:49] <Doomhammer> from googling it seems to have something to do with IE's implementation of innerHTML, but so far i haven't found any kind of workaround
[18:03:20] <aaronmcadam> Doomhammer: that gets added by jQuery itself
[18:03:36] <aaronmcadam> to do with how events get binded iirc
[18:03:54] <aaronmcadam> it's not something u need to worry about
[18:03:57] <Doomhammer> aaronmcadam, but why would it show up in IE8's "developer tools" but not in firebug or the chrome console?
[18:04:24] <Doomhammer> also the actual contents of the elements aren't being added correctly... inside that div is the first opening tag I was trying to insert, but the rest of it is gone
[18:04:27] <ziggles> aaronmcadam:  Am i setting this up as you instructed me earlier?   var spans = $(preprocessedTextString).find('span');
[18:04:28] <aaronmcadam> you can see it if u inspect the top level jquery object in window
[18:04:38] <aaronmcadam> ziggles ye
[18:05:33] <Tatsh> it's a good day
[18:05:35] <Tatsh> slashdot is dying
[18:05:43] <Tatsh> well, we might have educated comments from here on out only
[18:05:55] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: console.log(spans.size());   =>  0 when there should definitely be some in there.
[18:06:16] <aaronmcadam> side note, but don't use size()
[18:06:20] <aaronmcadam> .length is fine
[18:06:35] <ziggles> Lol i read in some jQ comments that size was better
[18:06:45] <aaronmcadam> they're idiots then
[18:06:50] <aaronmcadam> cuz size() calls length
[18:07:10] <aaronmcadam> ziggles: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=size
[18:07:46] <SerpentX> anyone know how to make a select filter another select in django forms from modal??
[18:08:12] <aaronmcadam> SerpentX: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/vm76N/
[18:08:34] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: makes sense to me.
[18:08:40] <ziggles> length it is from now on.
[18:08:43] <aaronmcadam> yip
[18:09:24] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: was using .find the correct approach?
[18:09:30] <aaronmcadam> yip
[18:09:35] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ ziggles
[18:09:35] <bot-t> ziggles, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:10:46] <SerpentX> ok thanks aaron
[18:10:59] <SerpentX> what i'm looking for tho
[18:11:14] <SerpentX> is to do with widgets and choices in the django form
[18:11:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know
[18:11:24] <aaronmcadam> but you can use the same idea
[18:11:30] <aaronmcadam> my team mate already did
[18:11:45] <aaronmcadam> you're not gonna get django-specific help in here anyway
[18:11:46] <SerpentX> hmm
[18:11:58] <aaronmcadam> #django for that
[18:12:09] <SerpentX> ya i gotta just register properly
[18:12:13] <SerpentX> i put asdf@asdf.com :/
[18:12:19] <SerpentX> that's what +r means right
[18:12:22] <SerpentX> register?
[18:13:22] <SerpentX> ye the reason why i want to see if i can do it in django directly when creating the form modal is cuz it's pulling from the GAE datastore
[18:13:31] <SerpentX> i don't think i can pull out of their directly with js
[18:13:43] <SerpentX> so i am either stuck making a json page
[18:13:55] <SerpentX> which is what everyone else seems to be doing
[18:14:22] <SerpentX> but i have a feeling their is a method in django itself..just hidden in the catacombs
[18:14:31] <ziggles> aaronmcadam: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/504051/
[18:16:33] <aaronmcadam> strange
[18:17:11] <aaronmcadam> it's creating the els
[18:17:54] <ziggles> Yeah... i was inspecting it a bit and it seemed OK.
[18:18:32] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, do you use jquery lint?
[18:18:42] <aaronmcadam> not really
[18:18:49] <aaronmcadam> my code's perfect ;)
[18:18:52] <aaronmcadam> lol
[18:19:01] <Tatsh> okay; it's just its warnings are so not descriptive, especially when they say 'consider undefined'
[18:19:05] <Doomhammer> aaronmcadam, i've figured it out - apparently surrounding HTML in double-quotes makes it puke, but doing single-quotes works fine
[18:19:22] <aaronmcadam> Tatsh: it's not perfect, it can report errors from the wrong places
[18:19:26] <aaronmcadam> it's a known issue
[18:19:52] <Tatsh> otherwise, really make my code longer with ('form.class-name' instead of just $('.class-name')
[18:19:59] <Tatsh> i don't think that's cool; catering to IE bs
[18:20:15] <aaronmcadam> don't qualigy it with form unless u need to
[18:20:22] <aaronmcadam> qualify*
[18:20:31] <aaronmcadam> overly specific selectors are bad
[18:20:49] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, jquery lint says to do this
[18:20:58] <aaronmcadam> for ie6?
[18:20:59] <Tatsh> says IE6-IE8 has bad performance with just class name
[18:21:11] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[18:21:21] <aaronmcadam> maybe it doesn't parse RTL like everything else
[18:25:32] <systemfault> Wow, great job with 1.7 :)
[18:25:53] <systemfault> I've been waiting for a .on('eventname',.... function for a long time :P
[18:26:56] <tmayr> i love how 1.7 came out 2 days after i handed out a project where on/off could've been really useful :P
[18:27:32] <systemfault> tmayr: How are they really useful?
[18:27:59] <systemfault> I mean.. I love the idea but seems it's only a nicer interface to already existing functionalities
[18:28:11] <systemfault> Perhaps I'm wrong.. but that's what I read :(
[18:28:25] <tmayr> its certainly not groundbreaking, but its a lot nicer than binding and unbinding :P
[18:28:33] <systemfault> I agree :)
[18:28:42] <tmayr> or at least thats what i understood, havent had a chance to play with it yet
[18:29:12] <systemfault> Not sure I'm in love with the idea that they "merged" the concept of event handler and event delegation but hey, it's still a nice upgrade :)
[18:31:10] <cpierce> how do you say $(this > img)
[18:31:24] <cpierce> like to apply something ot the image in this
[18:31:43] <tmayr> you could do $(this).find('img') or at least thats what ive been doing recently
[18:31:52] <tmayr> that might take quite a performance hit tho, i havent looked into it yet, there might be a better way
[18:31:58] <systemfault> Or pass the context as the second parameter
[18:32:07] <systemfault> find is probably the fastest.
[18:32:28] <systemfault> But selector speed is most of the time irrelevant.
[18:32:48] <coldhead> amen
[18:32:53] <systemfault> Because you should be caching your nodes so you don't need to select all the time.
[18:34:02] <cpierce> so i can do 		$(this).find('a > img').addClass('filter-sepia');
[18:34:28] * Tatsh tests if he can use jquery 1.7
[18:34:45] <tmayr> cpierce: yeah
[18:35:00] <cpierce> hrmm doesn't work
[18:35:15] <tmayr> jsfiddle your code
[18:35:54] <Tatsh> well unfortunately google is not yet hosting 1.7
[18:36:16] <coldhead> wtf paul_irish has the keys to push to google
[18:36:21] <coldhead> Y U NO PUSH, PAUL
[18:36:31] <systemfault> Paul is trolling us all!
[18:36:32] <tmayr> that silly paul
[18:36:55] <tmayr> in his defense, he was at a conference here in chile :p
[18:37:00] <systemfault> :)
[18:37:06] <systemfault> No excuses!
[18:37:34] <systemfault> Let's do "Occupy #JQuery"
[18:37:38] <tmayr> oh man
[18:37:51] <tmayr> we're the 99% that doesnt have the keys to push jquery to google!

[18:40:37] <systemfault> Ah, there's a note on the website
[18:40:38] <systemfault> ( v v v v v NOTE: 1.7 link should be working Nov 7 v v v v v )
[18:43:55] <TSnowman> hi, I'm wondering if anyone could tell me  if it's possible to put the loading-spinner in the autocomplete input box on the left rather than on right
[18:49:38] <coldhead> anything is possible if you can imagine it
[18:49:46] <coldhead> that's what being a computer scientist is all about
[18:51:44] <abjorn> coldhead, I found an article about you
[18:51:46] <abjorn> http://i.imgur.com/KqqhI.png
[18:53:09] <coldhead> i don't know why people don't just ASK me these things
[18:53:22] <coldhead> instead of forming their own conclusions
[18:53:46] <abjorn> ask you about uranus being pounded
[18:53:47] <abjorn> ?
[18:53:52] <coldhead> yes
[18:54:12] <abjorn> cause reports show that it's being pounded
[18:54:13] <abjorn> a lot
[18:59:02] <abjorn> http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Commodore-C64x-Extreme-edition/?kc=rss
[18:59:02] <abjorn> >mfw
[18:59:20] <abjorn> kind of want
[19:04:45] <coldhead> what would be good would be if when your browser saw duplicate IDs it would uninstall
[19:05:02] <coldhead> then people would avoid duplicating them better
[19:22:49] <last1> I have a table generated from JSON data. each row is a field from a database. each row also has an edit button. can I intercept the edit of a particular row without writing a click function for each row ?
[19:27:06] <dunkel2> hello
[19:27:46] <ziggles> Salutations
[19:27:48] <ajpiano> last1: yes, you can use event delegation
[19:28:12] <ajpiano> see this example: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/v8U3W/
[19:28:15] <ajpiano> ?delegate
[19:28:16] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:28:18] <ajpiano> etc.
[19:29:03] <dunkel2> im having a problem with a form inside a div i show as modalview, when i press enter it submits the form sending me to another page and i want a $.post
[19:29:14] <dunkel2> what could be the problem guys
[19:29:41] <ajpiano> you have to $("#yourForm").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault() }):
[19:29:59] <last1> ajpiano: thank you.
[19:30:02] <dunkel2> http://pastebin.com/LdPPRuY3
[19:30:03] <last1> should each row be its own form ?
[19:30:14] <last1> or I can have one form for the entire table ?
[19:30:14] <dunkel2> that is what i have
[19:30:38] <ajpiano> last1, you don't need 1 form for each row
[19:30:42] <dunkel2> and when i press enter in my field i have $('input[type=text]').clickOnEnter('.UIButtonEventSubmitAjax');
[19:30:58] <dunkel2> clickOnEnter is a plugin i found
[19:31:04] <ajpiano> dunkel2: what the hell is clickOnEnter
[19:31:05] <ajpiano> that's absurd
[19:31:06] <ajpiano> wtf
[19:31:13] <ajpiano> that sounds absurd
[19:31:23] <ajpiano> as far as approaches to solving this problem go
[19:31:23] <dunkel2> it is a plugin to clic a button when users rpess enter
[19:31:29] <dunkel2> my buttons are usually <a>
[19:31:48] <ajpiano> so yeah
[19:31:54] <dunkel2> so when i clic enter they do not do the submit until now i have my weird problem
[19:31:55] <ajpiano> i'm gonna just go back to not being here now :/
[19:32:03] <last1> lol
[19:32:05] <tmayr> ajpiano: if you dont mind me asking, delegate sounds a lot like live but i dont think ive ever understood the main difference, could you explain briefly before you leave? :P
[19:32:17] <ajpiano> tmayr: live is event delegation on the document
[19:32:21] <ajpiano> with a magical api
[19:33:25] <last1> ajpiano: does it also work on html data added through .html() ?
[19:33:29] <ajpiano> yes
[19:33:31] <last1> wait, your example explains that
[19:33:33] <last1> yes, sorry
[19:33:35] <ajpiano> as you can see in ...
[19:33:36] <ajpiano> :)
[19:33:49] <gholm> in the multiple selector, how can I implement the usual boolean stuff... ie ("a:has(img) :not('.thumb')")
[19:34:02] <gholm> I want to combine a multiple selector with a not
[19:34:11] <ajpiano> gholm: do it in a filter.. $(".foo,.bar,.baz").not(".thumb")
[19:34:26] <ajpiano> ok seriously im gone
[19:34:32] <gholm> ajpiano: ta
[19:34:46] <ajpiano> except dunkel2 you should not use some crazy clickOnEnter plugin
[19:34:52] <ajpiano> i've heard of a lot of jquery plugins in my day
[19:34:58] <ajpiano> and that one sounds really ... not a good idea
[19:35:12] <ajpiano> dunkel2: if you want to submit the form inside of something else, do a form.submit()
[19:35:17] <ajpiano> much better than crazy things
[19:35:19] <ajpiano> good luck
[19:35:23] <dunkel2> jeje
[19:35:24] <dunkel2> ty
[19:35:24] <dunkel2> !
[19:36:03] <last1> ajpiano: one last question. I actually have two actions possible by row: edit & delete. they are defined like this: <a href='#'><img src='gfx/icon-edit.png' alt='edit' /></a>
[19:36:11] <last1> should the custom ID be within the <img> tag ?
[19:36:48] <tmayr> last1: i would put em in the a, also, classes, not ids, as you'll have multiple rows
[19:36:49] <ajpiano> it can be whereever you want, you can traverse to it using .closest("tr") in the event handler
[19:37:08] <ajpiano> so i would do it where i have to repeat it the fewest times
[19:37:12] <ajpiano> IE only once
[19:37:25] <last1> but then how can I know if 'Edit' or 'Delete' was clicked ?
[19:38:12] <ajpiano> <tr class="foo" id="foo-24" data-foo-id="24"> <td><a class="edit">edit</a></td><a class="delete"> <td></td>  </tr>
[19:38:26] <ajpiano> you would be having a separate handler for each thing
[19:38:38] <ajpiano> yo uwould just be going up to the tr to fetch the id
[19:38:43] <ajpiano> ok
[19:39:56] <last1> won't the class='' override my default style ?
[19:40:19] <systemfault> He just made an example..
[19:40:24] <tmayr> if you dont have a defined style on that class, it wont
[19:40:34] <systemfault> The idea is that you create a delegate/live per button
[19:40:42] <systemfault> So in your case.. 2
[19:40:46] <tmayr> you could do class="edit-action" for instance if edit has a style already
[19:40:51] <systemfault> One for the edit, another for the delete.
[19:40:53] <last1> understood
[19:41:10] <sahbeewah> any benefit to switching over to .on() from delegate?
[19:41:31] <sahbeewah> seems 1.7 recommends it
[19:41:33] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: You keep up with any js frameworks?  I'm trying to find one with a deep set/get/observable orm.  So I can take a mongo document and pretty much pass it right to JS, represent it with an EJS, and have the EJS subscribe to _any_ change to the "model".
[19:41:46] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: i use backbone
[19:41:46] <systemfault> sahbeewah: It's definitely cleaner.
[19:41:52] <ajpiano> for that type of thing
[19:42:08] <ajpiano> sahbeewah: in 1.7 ... delegate is a just a shortcut to .on anyway so why not
[19:42:22] <ajpiano> more like a long-cut
[19:42:23] <TonkaTruck> TonkaTruck: I was looking at the docs and was put off that the model's data was in the root properties of the object.
[19:42:47] <TonkaTruck> or object "instance".  Maybe I need to look again.
[19:42:53] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: well, i was not put off by that and i am very contentr building apps with it :)
[19:43:44] * ajpiano vanishes
[19:46:41] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: they rectified this problem?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6234071/access-nested-backbone-model-attributes-from-mustache-template
[19:47:21] <last1> thanks guys, that works like a charm
[19:48:05] <last1> one more question: I bought this admin theme and they have a way of showing only X rows at a time from a table, despite the source code having all the rows defined. I imagine it's some CSS magic
[19:48:34] <last1> the problem is that when I use .html() to generate the table contents, the pagination breaks. is it possible to re-apply the CSS to the new data ?
[19:48:55] <systemfault> last1: Then it's probably not css, likely javascript...
[19:49:14] <last1> you're most likely right
[19:50:53] <last1> this is the code they use: http://jsfiddle.net/Ssm9r/
[19:51:07] <last1> I assume I should be calling it after .html() ?
[19:52:24] <tmayr> it should be called after all your data is ready i guess
[19:53:16] <Heshanh> if 9 have jQuery("#a, #b ,$c").click(...) is there a way to find out which one was clicked/
[19:53:25] <Heshanh> if i *
[19:53:34] <tmayr> $(this).attr('id')
[19:53:42] <Heshanh> thank u :)
[19:56:39] <last1> tmayr: from that code, can you tell how it's initialized in the first place ? I tried calling $.tablesorterPager.updatePageDisplay; after the .html() but it's not doing it
[19:57:51] <tmayr> uhmm
[19:58:40] <Heshanh> this is prob not a jquery but more of a js question, if i build string ''get_data_aa', is there away to make it to a function call. so i can call get_data_aa()
[19:59:19] <tmayr> yes there is, but im afraid if i tell you, im going to drag you to the dark side of the force, and with great power, comes great responsability
[19:59:40] <systemfault> Ewww
[19:59:46] <systemfault> </evil>
[20:00:01] <tmayr> last1: as far as i can tell, that code isnt initializating anything right away, arent you adding another line to initialize the table? like $(table).tableosrter() or something?
[20:00:09] <tmayr> Heshanh: look up for eval, use it with caution tho
[20:00:16] <Heshanh> i have a switch case ( 3 cases) that sets what type of a data i need to get. i just need to build 2 function names ending with _aa, _bb, _cc
[20:00:36] <Heshanh> ah oh. is there a better way u guys can suggest :)
[20:00:54] <tmayr> last time i had to deal with that, i couldnt find any other way, so i had to use eval
[20:01:03] <tmayr> i felt dirty for a month tho, not sure if it was worth it :( ...
[20:01:06] <systemfault> Pass a string to a function?
[20:01:11] <systemfault> And switch based on it?
[20:01:21] <coldhead> use flash
[20:01:24] <Heshanh> LOL!
[20:01:27] <last1> tmayr: could it maybe be this one ? http://jsfiddle.net/yVeud/
[20:01:31] <tmayr> systemfault: if i understand right, he wants to execute a function that is generated as a string by another code
[20:01:45] <tmayr> coldhead: i thought we were trying not to be evil :SSSSSSSSSS
[20:01:46] <systemfault> Ewwww......
[20:02:13] <tmayr> last1:  $sortingTable.tablesorter(tablesorterConfig); should be the one
[20:06:05] <last1> tmayr: I ended up copy/pasting that entire code in there and it works
[20:06:08] <last1> nothing less would do it
[20:06:15] <last1> thank you
[20:06:21] <tmayr> np :P
[20:13:42] <Heshanh> ok so i found a way around doing it without eval, but wats so bad about it
[20:30:13] <amanda19> can somebody tell me how to do before after picture with jquery fade effect on hover?
[20:33:00] <rickup> I have a link with a:link (NOT a:visited) a:hover a:active and they all display different effects - does anyone have a script/plugin that will allow me to animate this by looping through these link states?
[20:33:03] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[20:33:14] <JakeyChan> which method can get all of attributes ?
[20:35:51] <last1> is it possible that one click gets registered multiple times ?
[20:36:08] <last1> in my case, it gets consistenly registered 3 times!
[20:36:35] <Heshanh> some sorta save() loop ?
[20:36:36] <tmayr> you might have a loop somehwere
[20:37:25] <last1> don't think so. that pagination thing drives me crazy
[20:37:33] <last1> when I click on next page, it goes ahead by 3 pages
[20:37:58] <last1> if I have static data in the table it's fine. once it's dynamic, it jumps every 3 pages
[20:38:17] <Heshanh> what do u mean statci data in the table?
[20:38:42] <last1> this is the code for example: http://jsfiddle.net/DwxMF/
[20:38:54] <last1> it alerts 3 times that it got a click despite me having only clicked it once
[20:39:10] <last1> is there any other way a click could be generated ?
[20:39:45] <Heshanh> whats in (config.cssNext,pager)
[20:41:29] <amanda19> can somebody tell me how to change picture on hover?
[20:41:37] <amanda19> i need smooth effect fade in
[20:43:38] <Heshanh> .hover(function() { $(..).attr('src', new_path).fadeIn() } )... some thing along those lines?
[20:47:18] <last1> I think I know what's going on
[20:52:52] <dbe> Hello, I'm trying to track both the click of a checkbox, and its associated label. When I bind a click event to both, the checkbox click event gets triggered when I just click the label (understandably so)
[20:53:08] <dbe> How can I make it so I don't send the tracking for the checkbox click in the event someone clicks the label?
[20:53:34] <dbe> Is there some value in the event which would tell me its been triggered by the label? or some sort of preventDefault call that won't screw over other things?
[20:55:56] <Heshanh> are u selecting both on the same function? or is there 2 diff bind functions?
[21:09:35] <last1> for this code: http://jsfiddle.net/DwxMF/2/  what does the this.each() refer to ?
[21:10:18] <tmayr> maybe for each table? not sure
[21:11:08] <last1> that's why I have pagination problems. each time I use the pager thing, that something contains more and more stuff
[21:11:21] <last1> almost as if a variable doesn't get reset to 0
[21:11:40] <last1> trying to track it down
[21:11:54] <tmayr> maybe it happened when you changed and added all that code after that last link you showed me, where i pointed you where it was initialized?
[21:12:38] <last1> I don't think so. I just added that code straight up
[21:12:45] <last1> I think the code was designed to load only once
[21:12:54] <tmayr> probably
[21:13:05] <last1> and I call .html() multiple times and after each .html() I call that whole pagination code
[21:13:17] <tmayr> then thats it probably
[21:14:24] <last1> yes, any idea how to track down that this.each() ?
[21:15:24] <last1> the 'this' is referring to: tablesorterPager: new function() { ?
[21:15:24] <tmayr> cant you check that console.log there? see how many times it gets called?
[21:16:00] <last1> I did. before the each() it only gets called once all the time
[21:16:14] <last1> within the .each() loop it runs more and more times
[21:16:17] <tmayr> it should, wouldnt make sense if its the construct, sinces theres only one construct...
[21:16:39] <tmayr> again, im tno really sure :p
[21:16:40] <last1> so whatever 'this' is, keeps on getting added to
[21:24:46] <amanda19> where to find hover effect jquery code that replaces original image with another one on hover
[21:28:25] <Heshanh> its pretty eay to write. look up the hover effect on the jquery sit
[21:28:48] <Heshanh> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[21:33:17] <last1> is there a function to print all objects defined ?
[21:49:26] <coldhead> THAT WOMAN'S CRAZY
[21:49:35] <coldhead> SHE'S THE MISTRESS OF A MAN WHO'S CRAZY TOO
[21:57:27] <Thomas`-> Is is there a better way to keep animation in sync when doing smth like:  $(".e1").fadeIn(500); $(".e2").fadeIn(500); $(".e3").fadeIn(500);
[22:05:12] <Flam> Thomas`-: Just how you wrote it
[22:11:33] <coldhead> Thomas`-: $('.e1, .e2, .e3').fadeIn(500);
[22:18:27] <Thomas`-> thanks coldhead
[22:41:26] <Tatsh> okay this is just making me go mad
[22:41:32] <Tatsh> i need a tool that can profile JS, in IE7
[22:41:40] <Tatsh> ANYTHING
[22:51:53] <kcjojo> i'm developing a plugin that depends on a third-party library. what's the best way to package it with my plugin?
[22:53:48] <context> just include the file ?
[22:54:45] <kcjojo> how exactly?
[22:55:06] <coldhead> copy paste, file.. save
[22:55:29] <context> right click, copy file, go to project, right click, paste file
[22:57:48] <hkhalid> is it possible to use jquery, for if you click a link, a gif is popped up or a animated action happens and then a slide functions called to change slide?
[22:58:23] <context> yes.
[22:58:38] <context> there are many plugins that do that already as well
[23:00:27] <camcorder> hola
[23:00:51] <noob13> hey, i'm having a weird problem with json here
[23:01:15] <noob13> it's like the object which i'm getting isn't valid
[23:01:27] <noob13> though i'm very sure it is
[23:01:27] <camcorder> I got a newbie question. when I describe a function with $(".foo").click(), does jquery apply it to all nodes with 'foo' class or the first one?
[23:01:42] <noob13> camcorder: yes.
[23:01:49] <noob13> camcorder: all.
[23:02:01] <coldhead> noob13: does your JSON pass jsonlint?
[23:02:05] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint
[23:02:06] <bot-t> coldhead, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[23:03:11] <camcorder> and with which function i should get first appearance?
[23:03:18] <noob13> coldhead: it does!
[23:03:38] <noob13> camcorder: same function, different selector
[23:04:18] <camcorder> ok will check docs
[23:04:23] <coldhead> ?:first @ camcorder
[23:04:23] <bot-t> camcorder, :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[23:04:42] <camcorder> thanks
[23:04:44] <coldhead> can you pastebin your object somewhere noob13?
[23:05:17] <noob13> coldhead: i'm thinking it might have something to do with 'special' characters
[23:05:29] <noob13> like ä's and ö's, that are common in my language
[23:07:13] <noob13> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/6d713yvx
[23:07:25] <coldhead> thanks doc
[23:08:22] <coldhead> noob13: http://jsfiddle.net/7975Z/
[23:08:28] <coldhead> looks like JS is happy enough with your work
[23:08:34] <coldhead> are you retrieving this via AJAX?
[23:08:51] <coldhead> i have a funny feeling it's going to be related to your unicode
[23:09:59] <TonkaTruck> holy chizz, is there a template engine that observes data?  Is handlebars.js the only one or does jquery have something in the works?
[23:13:14] <noob13> coldhead: thing is, it seems to work fine on my local webserver, but not where it's supposed to run
[23:14:04] <noob13> coldhead: and yes, i'm using the jQuery.ajax function to fetch the object
[23:14:41] <coldhead> so i bet the target server has a different encoding
[23:15:06] <noob13> yes, it probably does
[23:15:08] <coldhead> you're not trying to ajax load data across two different domains are you?
[23:15:25] <noob13> coldhead: nope :)
[23:16:19] <coldhead> noob13: best bet is to google a bit about unicode+jquery+ajax+json
[23:16:27] <coldhead> and failing that, talk to europeans like nlogax
[23:16:35] <coldhead> those guys love imposing unicode on otheres
[23:16:55] <noob13> hehe, ok, thanks for your help
[23:17:18] <noob13> it seems as though this worked before i switched to jquery 1.7
[23:17:48] <noob13> even setting contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" in the ajax function doesn't do the trick
[23:19:45] <coldhead> noob13: if you can pin this down as an actual 1.7 bug with a real test case, honours will shower upon you
[23:23:13] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, answer me please: i use $ in my script: http://jsfiddle.net/rn4Ed/ , but then i need to introduce jquery library and when i do it - my own old script do not work, what should i do?
[23:25:04] <TonkaTruck> sorrymyeng: did you see this? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[23:26:49] <sorrymyeng> TonkaTruck: oh thank you very much
[23:27:00] <Eviltwin> sorrymyeng: You can try putting (function($){ before your code
[23:27:06] <Eviltwin> And })(jQuery); after it
[23:27:23] <noob13> coldhead: would the obvious workaround here be to change the character encoding of my json file?
[23:27:23] <Eviltwin> That means that for the entirety of your code $ means jQuery
[23:29:38] <coldhead> noob13: the obvious solution would be to just speak english, like normal people
[23:29:40] <coldhead> :D
[23:29:56] <noob13> :P
[23:30:10] <coldhead> supposedly you should utf-8 and that will fix everything forever
[23:30:17] <coldhead> except for some gypsy languages
[23:30:22] <coldhead> and all asians
[23:30:34] <coldhead> but those guys can look after themselves
[23:32:30] <nVee> morning. I have a problem in my one method. When a user clicks on a image hotspot, that hotspot's id attribute needs to be added to an array, and the method then rebuilds a content area on the site to reflect the hotspots information. This all works, but the method appears to duplicate the array elements. Here is the jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/GJcqY/1/
[23:32:51] <coldhead> that really sounds very complicated
[23:32:55] <nVee> builtItems() works perfectly on the 1st item click, but when you click on another hotspot, it duplicate the entry
[23:33:23] <nVee> well it works, I just dont think the for() loop is working correctly? hell i dont know :/
[23:33:41] <context> that wont even work
[23:33:53] <context> your missing a ) in the first this
[23:33:56] <nVee> context: Sorry, the method above is incorrect
[23:34:01] <nVee> let me paste the entire one :)
[23:34:04] <coldhead> you're*
[23:34:05] <context> and wwhy .each( this.click() ?
[23:34:14] <context> just do $('blah').click(...)
[23:34:43] <nVee> there is 49 hotspots
[23:34:47] <nVee> i dont want to duplicate my code
[23:35:01] <context> what ?
[23:35:08] <context> duplicate? you are making less code.
[23:35:20] <context> $().click() will apply to ALL matching elements
[23:35:33] <nVee> context: here is the updated one: http://jsfiddle.net/GJcqY/2/
[23:35:36] <nVee> that is the right code
[23:36:05] <context> change $(this) to $('#gameImg area') and drop the line above it.
[23:36:16] <context> stop writing unneeded coed
[23:37:05] <camcorder> noob13, are you sure it applies to all nodes?
[23:37:21] <nVee> context: I made the change as you said
[23:37:22] <context> for (i=0; i < blah.length; i++) and drop the pos = i - 1
[23:37:37] <nVee> it still works, but the problem remains
[23:37:55] <context> maybe check if the clickID is in the array before pushing it?
[23:37:58] <nVee> camcorder: I just added the -1 because I need the array position
[23:38:13] <Eviltwin> And new Array(...) is considered bad syntax
[23:38:18] <Eviltwin> Use [...] instead
[23:39:57] <noob13> camcorder: yes, $('.foo') should select all elements with class="foo"
[23:40:37] <nVee> this is pretty annoying :/
[23:40:51] <noob13> camcorder: like said, you need to use something like $('.foo:first') to only get the first
[23:41:17] <noob13> someone please correct me if that's not right
[23:41:49] <context> you could do .first() but no reason not to use the css selector
[23:43:23] <nVee> context: Could I not replace the for() with the jquery each() (and how do I get the array position within an jquery each?
[23:43:37] <noob13> ah, so $('.foo').first().click(...) would do the same?
[23:43:44] <context> jquery hands each the index doesnt it ?
[23:43:48] <Eviltwin> noob13: There's also an important distinction between :first and :first-child
[23:43:56] <Eviltwin> context: First argument
[23:44:00] <Eviltwin> Second argument is the thing itself
[23:44:04] <context> nvee: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[23:44:04] <Eviltwin> But that's also in "this"
[23:44:12] <Eviltwin> ?.each @ nVee
[23:44:12] <bot-t> nVee, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[23:44:13] <context> you could read the docs and see that you are given the index
[23:44:54] <noob13> coldhead: getting the json through a php script now and setting headers, but that doesn't work either :(
[23:45:13] <hoangtranwork> it seems that google cdn doesn't have jquery 1.7 yet
[23:45:17] <Eviltwin> coldhead: What's the problem? It's trying to parse it as XML?
[23:46:26] <noob13> encoding problems, if you're talking about my issue
[23:46:42] <Eviltwin> My bad, yeah
[23:46:42] <hoangtranwork> this link doesn't work: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js
[23:46:49] <Eviltwin> But I gotta go anyway
[23:48:56] <noob13> this problem is starting to be a pain in the ass now
[23:49:36] <coldhead> fortunately europe is just waking up!
[23:49:45] <coldhead> and those guys love your weird ass unicode problems
[23:49:49] <coldhead> for which they are to blame
[23:53:48] <noob13> it retrieves the json just fine, but when i try calling like data[1] it gives me something like "["... O_o
[23:59:42] <solidus-river> hey guys, is there a way to change the format of a block of text within at textfield?
[23:59:50] <solidus-river> so blcok out specific chunks
