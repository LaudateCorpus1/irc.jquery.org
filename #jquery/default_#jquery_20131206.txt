[00:08:08] <seba4> morning to all.
[00:08:17] <vince164> morning
[00:08:33] <seba4> one question ... i dont know how to search for it..
[00:08:44] <seba4> !$(this).is(':checked')
[00:08:52] <seba4> i suspect ! is like NOT?
[00:08:56] <seba4> am i right or
[00:11:50] <Cork> seba4: yes
[00:12:23] <Cork> !$(this).is(':checked'), !this.checked, !$(this).prop('checked') is all the same thing
[00:12:41] <Cork> except the first one is going a much longer route
[00:13:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork
[00:13:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> one could do
[00:13:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> also
[00:13:43] <seba4> oh thanks
[00:13:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[00:13:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[00:13:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> I was thinkingof css pseudo selector
[00:13:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> :not
[00:14:04] <Cork> heh sure
[00:14:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> couldnt you do this though
[00:14:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> $(this + ":not(checked)")
[00:14:25] <Cork> $(this).not(':checked').length < 1
[00:14:33] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: no
[00:14:50] <Cork> you can't combine a dom element with a string and get a usable result
[00:15:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> sucks :(
[00:15:11] <Cork> not really
[00:15:37] <Cork> js> print({something: true} + ":not(:checked)")
[00:15:40] <b-ot> Cork: [object Object]:not(:checked)
[00:16:08] <Cork> but if you want checked it is a property directly on this
[00:16:12] <Cork> just grab it from there
[00:16:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh so js doesnt have evaluation like php
[00:16:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> where you can throw a var into quotes and evals
[00:17:29] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: well no, but that doesn't matter in this case
[00:17:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[00:17:40] <Cork> "this" isn't a selector
[00:17:46] <Cork> it is an actual dom element
[00:18:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[00:41:10] <enape_101>  why am i getting a please match requested format when logging into my app
[00:43:12] <enape_101> ever since i required the jquery time picker library
[00:43:14] <enape_101> to my rails app
[00:43:33] <enape_101> now when i try to login on the email field, i'm getting "please match requested format" bubble, even though the format is correct
[00:43:38] <enape_101> not sure where this validation is coming from
[00:55:23] <kansai> what kind of vulnerabilities possible in a system using ajax??
[01:05:58] <kansai>  what kind of vulnerabilities possible in a system using ajax??
[01:07:39] <ueb> hi there
[01:13:44] <Cork> kansai: mitm if you arn't using ssl, dns hijacking just to name two
[01:14:02] <kansai> thanks
[01:14:13] <Cork> kansai: but these arn't restricted to just ajax
[01:14:35] <Cork> kansai: the most risky part is most likely xss
[01:15:09] <Krisostoomus> Hello. I want to remove this Cookie policy link from my page.  http://djrankings.org/development/soundc2.php?str=DJ-GAVIN_HERLIHY  What am i doing wrong? Code: http://pastebin.com/3MpNTQPc
[01:15:58] <Krisostoomus> Blocked a frame with origin "http://djrankings.org" from accessing a frame with origin "https://w.soundcloud.com".  The frame requesting access has a protocol of "http", the frame being accessed has a protocol of "https". Protocols must match.
[01:16:18] <ueb> anybody here uses Jquery Mobile?
[01:16:26] <Krisostoomus> is it possible somehow to remove this 'Cookie policy' from this page?
[01:16:28] <Cork> Krisostoomus: you can't
[01:16:33] <Krisostoomus> why?
[01:16:41] <Cork> those iframes are from xss
[01:16:50] <Cork> you can't access the content of pages from other domains
[01:17:01] <Krisostoomus> why
[01:17:03] <Krisostoomus> ?
[01:17:13] <Cork> cause that would open up xss attacks
[01:17:52] <Cork> you visit a page > page has an iframe pointing to facebook > page trigger password change on your account
[01:19:19] <Krisostoomus> i think i should be free to edit the page outlook like i want.
[01:19:48] <Cork> Krisostoomus: so you think it is fine to allow random page to access your information from what ever page they like?
[01:19:56] <Cork> like you bank account
[01:20:10] <Cork> your endurance page
[01:20:14] <Cork> and so on
[01:20:21] <Krisostoomus> hmm
[01:20:32] <Cork> Krisostoomus: if cross domain was allowed, that would be possible
[01:20:40] <Krisostoomus> that seems to have nothing to do what i am trying to do.
[01:20:46] <Cork> it is
[01:20:54] <Cork> page y is trying to access content on page x
[01:20:57] <batnas> Can anoybody help me with jQuery $.ajax() inside loops? my example is here: http://jsfiddle.net/H8UvH/  It simply returns an empty object..
[01:21:08] <ueb> I'm running a Jquery Mobile app and it looks too small on Galaxy S4
[01:21:09] <Cork> that is exactly what i'm describing
[01:21:17] <ueb> anybody could help please?
[01:21:30] <kansai> cork ajax just connection to a network?
[01:21:39] <Cork> batnas: ajax is async
[01:21:52] <Cork> batnas: so the return Result will run BEFORE done fires
[01:22:11] <Cork> you can't ever return the result from an ajax call
[01:22:19] <batnas> I know, thats why I put it in $.when().done().
[01:22:36] <Cork> batnas: that just builds a list and waits for all of them to fire
[01:22:51] <Cork> it doesn't freez the code at $.when
[01:23:13] <batnas> So what should i do if I need, say 4, URLs to load before returning the result
[01:23:19] <ueb> please help me with jQuery Mobile scale
[01:23:20] <Cork> kansai: ajax is a way to do get/posts without reloading the page
[01:23:46] <Cork> batnas: you need to rewrite the code so you don't have to return the results
[01:23:54] <seutje> batnas: u can't return it, you can only pass it upon receiving it
[01:24:02] <Cork> batnas: return the deferred object and use the callback
[01:24:30] <Cork> function func() { return $.ajax(); } func().done(function() {})
[01:24:33] <seutje> and then doStuffWith(data) instead of doStuffWith(asyncFuncThatReturnsData)
[01:24:39] <seutje> and then doStuffWith(data) instead of doStuffWith(asyncFuncThatReturnsData())
[01:24:40] <kansai> cheers Cork
[01:24:52] <kansai> u from corkcity ireland ??
[01:24:57] <Cork> no
[01:24:58] <batnas> That could work, but I would like to download new values in JSON-format every 5 seconds, and when I have them all, update my stuff
[01:25:17] <Cork> kansai: the nick comes from a swedish joke song from the 70's :)
[01:25:17] <seutje> he's from the neck of a wine bottle
[01:25:33] <seutje> Cork: wait, ur swedish?
[01:25:40] <Cork> "baladen om eugen kork"
[01:25:43] <Krisostoomus> hey guy. does anyone know how to remove this "Cookie policy" link from my page: http://djrankings.org/development/soundc2.php?str=DJ-GAVIN_HERLIHY . Maybe someone can give evean a code to do that?
[01:25:46] <seutje> or "sweetish" as I like to pronounce it :P
[01:25:50] <Cork> kork == cork in swedish
[01:25:59] <seutje> wild
[01:26:01] <Krisostoomus> guys
[01:26:10] <kansai> cork also a city close to dublin .P
[01:26:17] <Cork> kansai: i know
[01:26:27] <seutje> Krisostoomus: nope
[01:26:30] <Cork> kansai: there dns masks highlights me from time to time :D
[01:26:32] <seutje> it's x-domain iframe
[01:26:57] <seutje> that's why those services only provide x-domain iframes, so u can't mess with their copyrights and whatnot
[01:27:06] <Krisostoomus> i don't care what its is :D i need a solution for that. my salary depends on that!
[01:27:16] <seutje> forreal? how... dodgy
[01:27:26] <seutje> suppose u can proxy it, but it'll get very messy very quickly
[01:27:31] <seutje> also, illegal and stuff
[01:27:51] <Cork> Krisostoomus: only option is to proxy it over your own domain
[01:28:14] <Cork> Krisostoomus: you would have to have a php script accessing the resource and serving it on your own domain
[01:28:37] <Cork> though if the user needs to loggin it wouldn't work
[01:28:37] <seutje> and then the flash will fail getting it's resource
[01:28:38] <Krisostoomus> you mean $embed_info = json_decode($client->get('oembed', array('url' => $track_url)));
[01:28:43] <Cork> as the connection would come from your server
[01:28:43] <seutje> its*
[01:28:54] <Cork> Krisostoomus: no
[01:28:55] <seutje> yeah, it'll fail left and right, I'm afraid
[01:29:02] <Krisostoomus> ok
[01:29:11] <Krisostoomus> then it sucks
[01:29:27] <Cork> Krisostoomus: <?php echo file_get_content(url); ?>
[01:30:03] <Cork> but you would most likely be banned quite fast if you did that
[01:30:20] <Cork> cause you would have very high visit counts from your server
[01:31:24] <Cork> Krisostoomus: basically the domain serving the data controls the data on the net
[01:31:38] <Cork> Krisostoomus: it's up to them what you are allowed to do with it
[01:31:42] <Krisostoomus> ok damn
[01:31:55] <ph88> this gives me back 3 div's   $('div#wrapper section div.blocks.large div.block');   but this doesn't return anything    $('div#wrapper section div.blocks.large div.block:nth-child(3)');   it used to work .. it stopped working, what could it be ?
[01:32:22] <Cork> ph88: don't put tag names infront of id's
[01:32:30] <Cork> it slowes down the selector for no good reason
[01:32:32] <ph88> ok
[01:32:47] <Cork> as it actually means it needs to search the dom for all the divs
[01:32:47] <seutje> ph88: none of those divs are a 3rd child of their parent
[01:32:57] <Cork> and the filter it to the one that matches the id in the id hash
[01:33:09] <ph88> good point
[01:33:16] <ph88> thx guys
[01:33:19] <seutje> if theere are 3 div.blocks.large with each 1 div.block, it would behave as you described
[01:35:18] <ph88> seutje:  i changed the html .. after that it stopped working http://pastebin.com/szfGHhMX
[01:35:46] <seutje> whoa, a dedicated clear element? haven't seen those in a while :x
[01:35:50] <Cork> the third child is an a
[01:36:02] <seutje> yeah
[01:36:32] <Cork> if you cant children of the a tag you would need to describe that in the selector
[01:36:42] <Cork> #wrapper section div.blocks.large a:nth-child(3) div.block
[01:36:57] <ph88> aaahh
[01:37:06] <Cork> or actually #wrapper section .blocks.large a:nth-child(3) .block
[01:37:10] <ph88> i didn't understand what you were saying .. but that css makes a lot of sense !
[01:37:22] <ph88> thx Cork
[01:37:34] <ph88> seutje what do you use instead of a dedicated clear element ?
[01:37:42] <seutje> `g micro clearfix
[01:37:42] <b-ot> seutje: A new micro clearfix hack – Nicolas Gallagher → http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/
[01:37:44] <Cork> overflow: hidden
[01:37:53] <Cork> is normally what you want
[01:38:08] <seutje> I don't like the repercussions of overflow hidden, myself
[01:38:09] <Cork> the clear hack was deemed broken many years ago
[01:38:31] <seutje> how so? given you ditch the before?
[01:38:33] <Cork> there is only repercussions if you need things to overflow it
[01:38:58] <Cork> seutje: clear elements can clear other elements in the page
[01:39:18] <seutje> well, yeah
[01:39:21] <Cork> not hierarchy related to the element with the element
[01:39:23] <seutje> that's the idea
[01:39:26] <seutje> wat?
[01:39:31] <seutje> never had that occur
[01:39:55] <seutje> but I have run into numerous issues with overflow hidden
[01:40:02] <seutje> but hey, it's CSS, it's always been broken
[01:40:17] <Ububegin_> Wrt to Jquery UI's calender widget ? Is there a way to prevent pple from editing. I know you can set it to readonly, But what if the user wants to clear that field. Any nice solutions
[01:42:32] <Cork> seutje: quick hack together http://jsfiddle.net/2TfxH/1/
[01:42:52] <Cork> the clear in the left side affects the float in the #right element
[01:43:11] <Cork> this was a common problem back when the clear hack was the main solution
[01:43:27] <Cork> opps typo
[01:43:36] <seutje> erm
[01:45:10] <ueb> please help me with jQuery Mobile scaling, it looks too small
[01:45:51] <seutje> Cork: this is the clearfix I meant: http://jsfiddle.net/2TfxH/2/
[01:46:18] <Cork> seutje: ya, that one come later
[01:46:24] <Cork> removing the need for the extra eleemnt
[01:46:27] <Cork> *element
[01:46:34] <Cork> but the clear problem still existed
[01:46:36] <seutje> the other isn't a clear hack, it's how the clear property works o.O
[01:47:00] <seutje> "don't go floating next to floaties on this side"
[01:47:09] <Cork> seutje: well it is often used to get a parent to contain the float children
[01:47:19] <seutje> rly? that doesn't even work
[01:47:20] <Cork> and it caused a lot of problems
[01:47:22] <Cork> it does
[01:47:38] <seutje> do u mean putting it on the last element in the parent?
[01:48:04] <seutje> or on the parent?
[01:48:13] <Cork> yes
[01:48:17] <Cork> as the last element
[01:49:12] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/2TfxH/3/
[01:49:41] <seutje> yeah, that's what he was doing
[01:49:42] <Cork> this was VERY common back in ~2003 - 2007
[01:49:58] <seutje> that's why I was making fun of it, haven't seen it in forever
[01:50:01] <Cork> the best option for those are normally overflow:hidden;
[01:50:19] <seutje> nah, micro clearfix :P
[01:50:23] <Cork> except for the rare cases you need to overflow the parent
[01:50:28] <seutje> only disadvantage is that you can't undo it
[01:50:41] <seutje> which is almost never necessary
[01:50:51] <Cork> and honestly now days you most of the time can just skip the float all together
[01:50:58] <Cork> there are better ways to do it now days
[01:51:04] <seutje> I have to support some pretty shitty shit
[01:51:20] <Cork> <_<
[01:51:24] <Cork> bad node?
[01:51:30] <Cork> yup definitely
[01:51:42] <seutje> can't decide if it's a write error or a read error
[01:52:01] <seutje> I'd say the write errors caused the read errors, but the order is off :P
[01:52:04] <Cork> it depends in what direction it went
[01:52:33] <seutje> hehe
[02:08:07] <Aamir> This is high http://worlds-highest-website.com
[02:08:44] <seutje> " light speed hypertext transportation for free" :')
[02:17:38] <ph88> i load jQuery from google from link   //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js    i think the newest browsers detect http or https, but old IE versions don't load this link. How can i fix this?
[02:18:05] <Cork> ph88: what version of ie?
[02:18:11] <ph88> 8 and 9
[02:18:26] <ph88> no problem with, firefox, chrome and IE 11
[02:18:36] <Cork> quite sure 7 and up supports it
[02:18:39] * Cork chacks
[02:18:42] <Cork> *checks
[02:20:12] <ph88> well just tried it  IE9 says: undefined $    and 8 says: expected object
[02:22:14] <Cork> ugg i forgot how horribly slow ie7 was...
[02:22:43] <ph88> :P
[02:25:53] <Cork> ph88: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0Ml works fine in ie8
[02:26:14] <Cork> doesn't look like i have my old ie7 and ie6 machin loaded here at the moment
[02:26:27] <Cork> but i think it even works in ie6
[02:27:13] <ph88> Cork: i shall pastebin my script ok ?
[02:27:35] <Cork> ph88: check for other causes, the // isn't the cause
[02:27:40] <synju> Guys I'm trying to manipulate a $_SESSION['cart'] variable through jquery ajax however it isn't updating the session variable... basically I have a products.php normal script and a ajax products.php for all the ajax functions... http://pastebin.com/uddGZKEW
[02:28:13] <synju> Please help because I have a gun to my head. :P
[02:28:48] <synju> Seriously though, I can't seem to update a session variable via .post or .load
[02:28:50] <ph88> Cork:  this is exactly what i used http://pastebin.com/KH8k98tS
[02:28:54] <fosser_josh> i am getting reponse {"response_data": [["UK", "Aberdeen VC", "1004"], ["Canada", "Calgary", "1003"], ["UK", "London VC", "1001"]]} from python server and want to display it in my html page?
[02:28:59] <Cork> synapt: sounds more like a php question then a jquery one
[02:29:34] * synju jumps to the php channel
[02:30:03] <ph88> synju: inspect the network tab to see what is being send, if the right stuff is being send then it's php question, otherwise js/jQuery question
[02:30:14] <Cork> fosser_josh: ok?
[02:30:15] <ph88> Cork: can you try that script i just pasted ?
[02:30:20] <synju> kk
[02:30:36] <Cork> ph88: try reducing the content until you find what causes it
[02:30:51] <Cork> it is what i would have to do to start with anyway
[02:31:24] <ravenz> I have something like this http://jsfiddle.net/rjeNZ/ (an accordion). It works just fine on click, but if I also want it to work on focusin it breaks. Click one of the li to replicate the issue
[02:32:42] <fosser_josh> Cork: i have label in on html page and i tried to ('#label-id').text(data['response_data']) but its not showing anything on page. When i put alert(data['response_data']) it shows me complete data.
[02:32:47] <ravenz> apparently at the first click both focusin and click are handled, so focusin opens the inner UL and click closes it
[02:32:52] <fosser_josh> Cork: can you help me with this
[02:33:06] <Cork> fosser_josh: what do you want to add to the label?
[02:33:08] <fosser_josh> how can i show response_data in label?
[02:33:30] <Cork> response_data contains a multi directional array
[02:33:37] <ph88> omg ravenz has a question :P
[02:34:23] <Cork> ravenz: ah, classic
[02:34:30] <ravenz> I am lazyass sometimes
[02:34:39] <ravenz> Cork eh
[02:34:41] <fosser_josh> Cork:  how to display that array in label
[02:34:42] <fosser_josh> ?
[02:35:01] <Cork> fosser_josh: you want <label>[["UK", "Aberdeen VC", "1004"]</label> ?!?
[02:35:15] <Cork> or rather <label>[["UK", "Aberdeen VC", "1004"], ["Canada", "Calgary", "1003"], ["UK", "London VC", "1001"]]</label>
[02:35:17] <ph88> ravenz:  "to work on focusin"  ??
[02:35:39] <ph88> fosser_josh: try JSON.stringify()
[02:35:43] <ravenz> Cork any hint?
[02:35:52] <ph88> omg ignore -___-
[02:35:55] <ravenz> ph88 correct
[02:35:55] <Cork> ph88: i doubt very VERY much he wants that
[02:36:12] <ph88> ravenz: what do you mean ?
[02:36:19] <fosser_josh> Cork: <label>"UK", "Aberdeen VC", "1004", "Canada", "Calgary", "1003", "UK", "London VC", "1001"</label>
[02:36:21] <Cork> ravenz: either filter based on the first event, or use stopPropagation
[02:36:23] <ph88> Cork: i'm positive, but it might help investigate with what he wants
[02:36:26] <fosser_josh> ph88: ok
[02:36:49] <Cork> fosser_josh: so you want to flatten the array into a quoted string...
[02:36:58] <ph88> fosser_josh: you need 2 loops with join(', ') in the inner loop
[02:37:05] <fosser_josh> Cork: yes
[02:37:07] <ph88> or perhaps there are better flat functions :P
[02:37:10] <ravenz> ph88 when you navigate using a keyboard (throught the tab key) each LI gets focus
[02:37:21] <lite__> having some problems catching keydown elements in a widget i made. ive got $(element).keydown() where element is the widget but it would appear that the keydown event is only caught in the widget if it has an inputfield with focus
[02:37:24] <ph88> maybe jQuery has flat funciton, pretty sure underscore has one
[02:37:27] <fosser_josh> ph88: ok
[02:37:50] <lite__> is there a way to force focus on the widget even if it doesnt directly have a field like the input field?
[02:37:51] <ravenz> Cork stopPropagation() ?
[02:38:14] <ph88> ravenz: focus works here, no problem
[02:38:20] <Cork> fosser_josh: $.map(response_data, function(elm) { return '"' + elm.join('", "') + '"'; }).join(', ') should do it
[02:38:23] <ravenz> it doesn't fix it
[02:38:52] <ravenz> ph88 yeah, but it doesn't on click
[02:38:59] <fosser_josh> Cork:  let me try
[02:38:59] <ravenz> I mean it does, but it is buggy
[02:39:08] <Cork> ravenz: so what is the result you want?
[02:39:12] <seutje> ravenz: problem is that the event don't necessarily fire at the same time
[02:39:14] <ph88> ravenz: it does here
[02:39:19] <seutje> debouncing would be a solution, I guess
[02:40:06] <ravenz> Cork the natural one, focusin in shouldn't be handled on click
[02:40:19] <ravenz> seutje yeah
[02:40:19] <ph88> ravenz: there seem to be more problems then just getting focus right. Sometimes second one stays open
[02:40:22] <Cork> ravenz: that's a tough one
[02:40:29] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/rjeNZ/1/
[02:40:30] <Cork> ravenz: as click happens after focus
[02:40:37] <seutje> just debounce it?
[02:40:39] <ravenz> Cork always?
[02:40:42] <Cork> you would have to delay the focus event enough to let click happen
[02:40:46] <ph88> ravenz:  now i click on the second, first one opens and stays open
[02:40:52] <ravenz> seutje debounce the click or focusin?
[02:41:00] <ravenz> oh you made a fiddle
[02:41:03] <ravenz> let me check
[02:41:06] <seutje> the handler
[02:41:37] <seutje> stole it off http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ real quick btw
[02:41:37] <ravenz> right
[02:41:42] <ravenz> I have my own
[02:41:45] <ravenz> debounce fn
[02:41:47] <ravenz> np
[02:42:05] <seutje> just make sure u execute at start instead of end
[02:42:15] <fosser_josh> Cork: thanks
[02:42:21] <fosser_josh> it works perfectly
[02:42:34] <seutje> impossible, it's the web!
[02:45:36] <ravenz> well thanks seutje
[02:46:52] <ph88> Cork:  i reduced those test cases to make them easier and tried your file as well. These are the results  http://pastebin.com/tHZACKxY
[02:48:02] <rved> hi all, how do i plot a google line chart with multiple lines which don't share the same x-axis value's?
[02:48:15] <rved> this is quite difficult, cause i can't find documentation
[02:48:36] <rved> all the docs say: x: A    y1: 2   y2: 3
[02:48:46] <Cork> ph88: are you loading this from file:// or something?
[02:48:50] <fosser_josh> Cork:i did  var adbk = $.map(addressbook, function(elm) { return '"' + elm.join('", "') + '"'; }).join(', '). how can i count how many items are there in adbk?
[02:48:54] <Cork> ph88: i tested in ie8 and it works fine there
[02:49:02] <rved> and not: x1: A y1: 2 .... x2: B y2: 3
[02:49:48] <Cork> fosser_josh: adbk.split(',').length
[02:50:14] <Cork> fosser_josh: or do a count in the map loop
[02:50:26] <Cork> elm.length and then add them up in a variable
[02:50:29] <fosser_josh> Cork: thanks
[02:54:20] <ph88> Cork:  yes loading from file://
[02:54:33] <Cork> ph88: that might be the cause
[02:54:39] <ph88> Cork: good thinking
[02:54:50] <ph88> thx again Cork
[02:55:28] <seutje> lol, classic
[02:55:48] <seutje> run into that a few times myself, when working on static slides served from file://
[02:56:54] <kansai> Cork:

[02:57:05] <Cork> ?ask
[02:57:06] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:57:46] <kansai> random question but maybe you could help..
[02:57:52] <kansai>    there are youtube,twitter and few sites came with led tv imde tv internet.. is it possible to have a browser in Lcd tv ? what do i need?
[02:58:20] <Cork> heh that was a bit offtopic
[02:58:34] <Cork> i don't even own a tv :)
[02:58:36] <Cork> so donno
[02:59:12] <kansai> cheers
[03:06:55] <rved> how do i  make a google chart with a dataTable that contains 2 lines with non-sharing x values? http://jsfiddle.net/TD92C/
[03:07:04] <dadonp> Is there any easy way to have remote, nested tabs?
[03:09:05] <rved> agh if i use NULL i can manage
[03:17:42] <doev> does someone know jquery easyui? How can I set an own event-handler-function? All I know so far is, that there is a "onSelect" Event.
[03:22:46] <glambert> what's the best way of matching a regular expression anywhere on a page?
[03:22:54] <glambert> I've tried $(document.body).text().match() etc. and even replacing whitespaces in .text()
[03:22:55] <Relequestual> doev sure. Have you looked at the examples and tried to create a basic one in a jsfiddle?
[03:23:30] <doev> I tried: $("#id").onSelect(function(){ alert('test'); }); but that fail with element is null.
[03:23:38] <Cork> glambert: what are you trying to do?
[03:24:05] <pythys> Hi everyone. If I receive a unicode string from the server in the form &#1578;&#1580;&#1575; etc ... How do I convert this to regular text?
[03:24:24] <glambert> find telephone numbers on a page using regular expressions, if it can find some then I'm going through each element to find the elements that contain those numbers and doing some fancy stuff with them
[03:24:25] <Relequestual> doev Create the same in a jsfiddle and I'll see if I can help =]
[03:24:55] <Cork> pythys: $('<div>').html(input).text()
[03:25:56] <pythys> Cork: Must I select an element? I'm working inside of an SVG which makes things kinda complicated
[03:26:09] <Cork> pythys: it isn't selecting
[03:26:25] <Cork> pythys: it creates a div and uses it to parse the entities
[03:26:38] <pythys> Cork: Oh .. I see I see, your <div> is the actual html
[03:26:49] <Cork> well not actually
[03:27:02] <Cork> pythys: <name> is a shorthand in jquery
[03:27:08] <Cork> it does document.createElement
[03:28:26] <pythys> Cork: hmmm, I'm building the string in the back-end server, so I just receive it as the above unicode, and I'm building a JSON that contains in parts of it this unicode, so I just need to decode it before adding to the JSON
[03:28:47] <pythys> Cork: I don't need any divs for that
[03:28:50] <Cork> pythys: that isn't unicode
[03:28:57] <Cork> that is html entities
[03:29:08] <Cork> if you send unicode you don't need to escape it
[03:29:09] <pythys> Cork: uh-huh, it's HTML representation of unicode
[03:29:20] <Cork> yes
[03:29:29] <pythys> that's what I'm receiving from the backend, I can't change that
[03:29:35] <Relequestual> doev if you do make a jsfiddle, mention me with link
[03:29:50] <Cork> pythys: so if you need to decode it you need to use the code i gave you
[03:30:12] <Cork> pythys: if you plan to add it to a dom and not do any parsing before hand
[03:30:13] <doev> Relequestual, can I use easyui on fiddle?
[03:30:15] <doev> let me see
[03:30:15] <Cork> you can just append them
[03:30:55] <glambert> any ideas Cork?
[03:31:15] <Relequestual> doev yeah should be able to. probably in the dropdowns on the left
[03:31:28] <pythys> Cork: Dude, you are awesome
[03:31:29] <Cork> glambert: it would help if you could limit where they might exist
[03:31:38] <pythys> Cork: Thank you very much
[03:31:40] <Cork> glambert: like in paragraphs or similar
[03:31:44] <Cork> pythys: np
[03:31:48] <Alina-malina> what am i doing wrong here:( http://pastebin.com/Rquu6pkA
[03:32:13] <Cork> glambert: cause if want to modify what you have there you must get the parent
[03:32:38] <Cork> Alina-malina: don't ever use document.write
[03:32:48] <Alina-malina> lol
[03:32:56] <Alina-malina> with console.log it doesnt work either
[03:32:57] <Cork> i really mean EVER
[03:33:26] <Cork> well you have a few unclosed functions
[03:33:31] <Cork> make sure you don't have any js errors
[03:33:36] <Alina-malina> no errors
[03:33:42] <Alina-malina> it just doesnt print out my json:(
[03:33:52] <Alina-malina> in console
[03:34:01] <Cork> do you actually get the data from the server?
[03:34:11] <Alina-malina> yes it gives ok status
[03:34:12] <pythys> Cork: Can I bother for an explanation of what the $('<div>') part means? does that mean create an actual div?
[03:34:26] <Alina-malina> pythys, no
[03:34:28] <Cork> yes
[03:34:32] <vince164> hey is this not the correct way to change the css display
[03:34:33] <vince164> $("#errdiv").css("display", "block !important");
[03:34:45] <Cork> pythys: $('<div>').html().text() is the same as
[03:34:57] <Alina-malina> Cork, so what are we going to do?
[03:35:08] <Cork> var div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = input; div.innerText
[03:35:24] <pythys> ahhhh
[03:35:27] <Cork> Alina-malina: you could start by adding an error even handler
[03:36:03] <Cork> pythys: except that text() textContent for gecko
[03:36:27] <pythys> fantastic .. light bulbs are flashing
[03:36:28] <Cork> unless they have removed that exception now that gecko support innerText
[03:37:30] <Cork> * except that text() uses textContent for gecko
[03:40:22] <doev> Relequestual, I don't get the example running ... I guess it can't access the external json-file for filling the table.
[03:40:28] <doev> http://jsfiddle.net/V2QEs/2/
[03:40:49] <doev> sourec: http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/datagrid/datagrid3_demo.html
[03:41:21] <glambert> Cork, it's for a browser plugin so I can't control where the numbers appear unfortunately
[03:41:36] <Alina-malina> Cork, when data comes i get this in headers: Content-Type:	application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8    so when i console log it dump the json content, but when i try to do like data.title it gives nothing
[03:41:52] <Cork> glambert: then you are going to have a complicated time fiddling with it
[03:41:58] <Alina-malina> Cork, sorry i get this: Content-Type:	text/html; charset=windows-1251
[03:42:01] <Alina-malina> not the previous
[03:42:19] <Alina-malina> should i convert this data to json?
[03:42:22] <Cork> wait
[03:42:23] <glambert> Cork, tell me about it :P
[03:42:33] <Cork> you get response as application/x-www-form-urlencoded ??
[03:42:57] <Cork> glambert: you will have to play with textNodes how ever you go
[03:43:05] <Alina-malina> Cork, i get this: text/html; charset=windows-1251
[03:43:15] <Cork> Alina-malina: well there is the first problem
[03:43:22] <Cork> the server sends html not json
[03:43:25] <glambert> got it working now, mostly :)
[03:43:26] <Alina-malina> hes thats right
[03:43:49] <Alina-malina> Cork,  there is just myfile.json on server
[03:44:01] <glambert> Cork, what I'm doing is checking for matches, if I find some, then I'm going through node by node to find which element contains the number
[03:44:11] <Cork> Alina-malina: config the server to take .json as application/json mimetypes
[03:44:16] <glambert> rather than just blindly go through node by node when there may not be any matches
[03:44:33] <Cork> Alina-malina: can be done in .htaccess if you don't have server access
[03:44:44] <glambert> what I'd screwed up on was I needed to .split("\n") the document or whatever parent element was first to go through
[03:44:49] <Alina-malina> i just grab the file with POST from server loool
[03:44:51] <glambert> and check line by line rather than the whole document
[03:45:13] <Cork> glambert: it won't be much faster, as the entire dom has to be serialized to text for the code to work
[03:45:30] <Cork> glambert: and then it would still have to loop the dom to do anything
[03:46:01] <glambert> Cork it's actually pretty quick at the moment on a page with probably thousands of numbers so I'm quite pleased with it
[03:46:11] <glambert> will be quicker when I tidy up the code to remove console logging etc.
[03:46:45] <Alina-malina> Cork, is it possible to convert to json in client side that html?
[03:47:07] <Cork> Alina-malina: well yes you could take the data as text and parse it
[03:47:18] <Cork> Alina-malina: but it is one line of htaccess server side to fix the problem correctly
[03:47:37] <Cork> i sincerely recommend doing that
[03:47:43] <Alina-malina> lool, i am just lazy, i will add those parameters to php script to return normally thanks for help!
[03:59:30] <rved> how do i merge 2 data tables in google charts? http://jsfiddle.net/TD92C/
[04:10:09] <Relequestual> doev yeah, I don't think you can do ajax requests on jsfiddle
[04:10:22] <Relequestual> doev you can fake the result though http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[04:17:29] <seutje> rved: just add another entry to the data arrays: http://jsfiddle.net/TD92C/3/
[04:20:57] <glambert> can you replace text with a jQuery element?
[04:22:15] <seutje> glambert: you mean replacing an element's content with something else?
[04:22:27] <glambert> kind of
[04:22:57] <xec_> what is a jquery element?
[04:23:00] <seutje> either .html('some html as a string')
[04:23:13] <seutje> or .empty().append(jQueryCollection)
[04:23:14] <glambert> imagine you had "<div>This is a div</div>"  could you change it to "<div>This is a <u>div</u></div>" but a bit more complicated than that?
[04:23:29] <Cork> xec_: there is no such thing
[04:23:34] <seutje> .html then I suppose
[04:23:37] <Cork> xec_: there are jqeury wrapped elements though
[04:23:51] <glambert> In my case the <u></u> will have events bound to it though
[04:23:56] <Cork> xec_: those are normal dom elements wrapped in a jquery array like object
[04:24:06] <xec_> cork: i know, i was just trying to make glambert rephrase the question
[04:24:11] <seutje> should probably delegate those events anyway
[04:24:14] <Cork> glambert: you can't replace html without destroying the dom
[04:24:29] <Cork> ah
[04:24:34] <seutje> that's a rather harsh way to put it :P
[04:24:41] <Cork> xec_: sorry i'm quite tired, might have missed that
[04:24:44] <seutje> making it sound like the entire page will explode
[04:24:44] <xec_> ;)
[04:24:51] <glambert> ok
[04:25:15] <seutje> glambert: you can use .on and bind the events to a parent element and pass the selector for the <u>
[04:25:25] <Cork> xec_: closing on hour 30 >_>
[04:25:26] <seutje> then u can switch all u want, it'll still catch it
[04:25:46] <seutje> Cork: sleep is one of the few things humans really need
[04:25:49] <xec_> Cork: ouch! get some sleep man, or a hefty dose of caffeine?
[04:26:14] <Cork> xec_: jour does this to you some days :)
[04:26:32] <Cork> i'll be off in ~30 mins though
[04:26:39] <doev> Relequestual, never mind .... I work with a manaul button for the first, till I have time to learn about the events. thx ;)
[04:26:46] <xec_> what's jour?
[04:27:09] <Cork> xec_: your on call for server problems
[04:27:16] <Cork> and it called :)
[04:27:22] <xec_> ah, right
[04:27:40] <xec_> sucks :( i hope you get paid well
[04:31:26] <Relequestual> doev always finding time to learn isn't it haha =] good luck!
[04:31:55] <SprkDev> I have this jquery plugin which works fine. But I want to change so that as soon as I click the image, it is at a fixed square size of 200 x 200. WHich means the users will not be adjusting the size of the crop. How can I do this? http://pastebin.com/aZbLKHrH
[04:32:35] <doev> Relequestual, I am sure in some days things are clear  ;)

[04:48:59] <Krisostoomus> is there any way to remove this "Cookie policy" from http://djrankings.org/development/soundc.php?str=DJ-GAVIN_HERLIHY

[04:50:59] <tm89> I have a small problem! this: http://pastebin.com/hqdhCcLW gives me typeerror! I cant see why
[04:53:08] <lite_> why does $(window).keydown(function(event){ if(event.keyCode == 40) event.stopPropagation(); }) not prevent the browser from catching the keydown event ?
[04:53:26] <lite_> the browser still starts scrolling down when i press the down arrow
[04:55:27] <Cork> lite_: stopPropagation doesn't prevent the browser
[04:55:32] <Cork> preventDefault does that
[04:55:57] <lite_> excellent!
[04:55:58] <lite_> thanks
[05:17:33] <SprkDev> I am using a jquery plugin with imagearea select where the image is cropped. This works perfectly fine. But is it possible for default selection to be made on load?
[05:18:08] <airdem> Cork,
[05:18:09] <Relequestual> SprkDev impossible to tell if you don't tell us what the plugin is and where to find it ;)
[05:18:11] <airdem> you there?
[05:19:04] <airdem> Cork, just wanted to let you know that the FormData upload is working now. i tryed $.ajax with some optiion instead of $.post and voila! :)
[05:19:11] <airdem> *tried
[05:19:24] <seutje> SprkDev: jCrop allows you to pass an array of coordinates as setSelect
[05:19:25] <SprkDev> http://www.w3bees.com/2013/08/image-upload-and-crop-with-jquery-and.html
[05:23:12] <airdem> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7823722 line 19 does not seems to get the upload function from line 1. how can i fix this?
[05:26:34] <airdem> anybody? :)
[05:31:38] <SprkDev> My jquery seems to works fine on most, images but it is cropping the wrong place when the image is too big. Why?
[05:36:25] <tboerger_> knows somebody if i can get a callback after rendering for handlebars?
[05:42:58] <libin> hello.. is there any way that i can bind data after the page load happens when using a templating engine
[05:43:34] <Relequestual> libin probably. You'll have to fill in the blanks here
[05:43:44] <libin> :)
[05:43:59] <libin> i am using jqote a jquery plugin
[05:45:03] <libin> i have got a partial page which have certain divs, when a div is clicked , i got to bind the corresponding data of that div to few other divs...
[05:45:35] <libin> but my problem is that the data was binded at the load of the page, its always empty
[05:45:44] <libin> i hope I am making sense
[05:46:43] <libin> Relequestual : did I make sense
[05:47:03] <Relequestual> I think so. you want to run the bind after the templating engine has finished
[05:47:47] <libin> yes
[05:48:06] <libin> you are right on Relequestual
[05:48:41] <Relequestual> What version of jquery are you using?
[05:50:46] <libin> Relequestual: Its 2.0.3
[05:52:16] <Relequestual> you could try using .promise
[05:55:06] <airdem> i want to replace the content of a div with content from a jq object, whats the best way
[05:55:31] <airdem> i could to content.html().append(object)
[05:55:48] <airdem> but i was wondering if i could use replaceWith() - i always fail
[05:56:12] <airdem> content.html('').append(object)
[05:56:29] <Relequestual> airdem have you looked up the examples in the docs?
[05:57:03] <airdem> yes. and im thinking that i got it but then its just not working the way i thought it would
[05:57:14] <airdem> taking a look again
[05:57:17] <GolfWang> guest001:: if you have a jquery question, please ask here. Do not PM members randomly.
[06:06:09] <airdem> Relequestual, im still not gettign it. lets say i have <div class="container"><p>stuff</p><span>more stuff</span>....</div> now how do i replace the content of .container with another jq object?
[06:06:39] <airdem> $(".container > *").replaceWith(object); doesnt seems to work
[06:06:46] <airdem> or .container *
[06:06:53] <airdem> maybe im just using the wron selector. i dont get it
[06:06:58] <airdem> *wrong
[06:10:03] <SprkDev> My jquery seems to works fine on most, images but it is cropping the wrong place when the image is too big. Why?
[06:10:09] <SprkDev> WHy do some images not work.
[06:10:13] <SprkDev> http://www.w3bees.com/2013/08/image-upload-and-crop-with-jquery-and.html
[06:10:46] <Relequestual> airdem if you try the selector using the console, you can tell if it's correct
[06:11:19] <Relequestual> airdem if you could create a jsfiddle, people will be more able to help
[06:13:47] <airdem> Relequestual, could it be that replaceWith only works with pure html?
[06:14:10] <airdem> and that it the events bound to the replacement are always lost?
[06:14:49] <Relequestual> airdem you really need to make a jsfiddle in order for people to help you effectivly
[06:14:56] <airdem> heheheh
[06:15:21] <airdem> ok let me try to recreate this
[06:21:23] <airdem> Relequestual, http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/
[06:21:33] <airdem> the problem is that the div inside #foo is lost
[06:21:43] <airdem> i just want to replace the content of that div
[06:22:28] <Relequestual> ok let me take a look see airdem
[06:26:34] <Relequestual> here you go =] http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/1/
[06:26:37] <airdem> Relequestual, i start to believe that c.html('').append(a); is the only solution for that
[06:26:41] <airdem> oh okay
[06:27:10] <airdem> Relequestual,  :P
[06:27:11] <Relequestual> any reason you are using var c when you could do straight $('#foo div').html(a); ?
[06:27:33] <airdem> no reason
[06:28:04] <Relequestual> so what are you making? =]
[06:33:04] <airdem> was just confused by replace function
[06:33:22] <airdem> now i got this problem: console.log(response) returns Object[div#content-box-gray, br, br, form.accelerated]
[06:33:39] <airdem> response.find('form').length returns false
[06:33:47] <airdem> why that? :P
[06:34:43] <Relequestual> you know what to do =p
[06:35:28] <airdem> you liek to see me work, do you? :)
[06:35:28] <Relequestual> If you're following a tutorial, it might not be the best one
[06:35:33] <Relequestual> haha
[06:35:45] <Relequestual> well that's the best way to help
[06:36:30] <airdem> Relequestual, http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/2/
[06:37:42] <Relequestual> airdem http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/3/
[06:38:12] <airdem> hey you changed var c!!
[06:38:14] <airdem> hehe
[06:38:43] <airdem> c contains a website and i only want to get the content of a div
[06:38:49] <airdem> thats why i did > *
[06:40:37] <airdem> Relequestual, retusn 1 now
[06:40:38] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/4/
[06:40:46] <airdem> but i dont know if this is a good habit :P
[06:41:49] <Relequestual> lol hum
[06:44:41] <doev> How can I give a ajaxs post-variable a name? f.ex. $.ajax({ ... type: 'POST', data: JSON.stringify(ids), ...}); ... where ids is an array [ ids = []; ids.push(...); ...  ]
[06:45:23] <doev> POSTDATA is [1,2,3] but has no name
[06:45:29] <airdem> doev, data expects an array for key value pairs i believe
[06:45:42] <airdem> *of key value pairs
[06:46:13] <airdem> {'field1': value1, 'field2': value2}
[06:46:29] <airdem> {field1: value1, field2: value2}
[06:46:41] <doev> ah, data: {'test': idsString} is ok. thx
[06:46:52] <airdem> if you have a html form
[06:47:13] <airdem> you could just do var data = $('form').serializeArray();
[06:47:37] <airdem> that would create the array of key:value pairs you need for ajax
[06:50:26] <Relequestual> airdem have to use filter rather than find as find only does descendants, http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/5/
[06:51:27] <airdem> Relequestual, thanks a lot!
[06:51:30] <Relequestual> or rather... http://jsfiddle.net/nLwbR/6/
[06:53:24] * Relequestual gets back to work ;)
[07:17:25] <TheEternalAbyss> can someone explain to me why setInterval seems ot arbitrarily change scoping of variables? http://jsfiddle.net/TheEternalAbyss/CCVTr/5/ <-- specifically in the second nested set interval, two variables are not giving me correct and expected values because it's ignoring the initilization of said variables (itcount and opVal)
[07:17:32] <TheEternalAbyss> seems to*
[07:19:07] <krambiorix> can someone tell me what's going on?! http://jsfiddle.net/8qkDw/
[07:20:29] <krambiorix> in firebug i get  : code.replace is not a function
[07:22:18] <Nach0z> krambiorix: i'd be willing to bet 'code' is a reserved keyword from the syntax highlighting there
[07:24:02] <TheEternalAbyss> k gues snot
[07:25:04] <Nach0z> TheEternalAbyss: it's only been seven and a half minutes :|
[07:25:48] <Nach0z> also I have no idea.
[07:26:03] <TheEternalAbyss> so? there are hundreds of people and it's a simple program
[07:27:01] <Nach0z> there's hundreds of people that don't know anything about what you're asking. there may be ten people that know. it's in the morning on a work day, and it's still only been seven and a half minutes.
[07:27:33] <Nach0z> IRC Q&A questions in a relatively inactive channel such as this... they can have response times upwards of two hours for the initial question. All I'm saying is, be a bit more patient :P
[07:27:40] <ghostlines> howdy, is it possible to emulate a click or touch event. I want to fake a touch/click event and then add action to it
[07:27:53] <TheEternalAbyss> inactive..
[07:27:57] <krambiorix> Nach0z, rekcode.replace is not a function  :s
[07:28:55] <TheEternalAbyss> this chan is always active whenever I'm here so I'm not sure I agree with that, however i'm not interested in speculation on who knows or who knows not
[07:29:28] <Nach0z> krambiorix: it's possible that it's not treating the code variable as a string
[07:31:30] <Nach0z> ghostlines: should be an element.click() method IIRC
[07:32:52] <rtnptr> A disabled 'select' is not successfully being enabled on my jQuery Mobile page using $('#foo').prop('disabled',false) or $('#foo').removeAttr('disabled') post page load even after using $('#foo').selectmenu('refresh', true).  Does anyone know how I can successfully control the disabled/enabled status of a select post page load?
[07:33:45] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/YYfnByo.gif watch this in the meantime
[07:34:02] <krambiorix> Nach0z, after casting the variable to a string it worked
[07:34:06] <krambiorix> Nach0z, thanks
[07:34:29] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: no thanks, though I'm surprised nobody has used that as a loader gif
[07:34:31] <Nach0z> np
[07:34:55] <grafi> comming soon to facebook
[07:35:08] <grafi> is that the loader you came up with? or is it some library?
[07:36:27] <jParkton> I want to have a static sidebar and scrollable content. What am I looking to google to find how to create that?
[07:36:34] <jParkton> Scrollable div?
[07:37:00] <grafi> oô
[07:37:15] <Nach0z> rtnptr: if you're waiting for something else to be selected prior to enabling the dropdown menu, you might try $(prerequisite_element).change(enable_select_function)
[07:38:44] <rtnptr> Nach0z, I didn't even know about that, thank you.  I disable the select on page load and after a different select is chosen an AJAX call is made.  Depending on the results of the AJAX call I may re-enable/disable the secondary select.  I'll try to apply your suggestion to my situation.  Thank you :)
[07:38:46] <airdem> ive created a file upload form. now i would like to add drag and dropo feature. would be nice if the drop would just give the information to <input type="file"> and all i have to do is submit my already working form.
[07:38:59] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: my fiddle? I did it mostly myself. I just took the base css from a blog about making pie charts with css
[07:39:10] <airdem> this is the current js code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7826708
[07:39:40] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss looks cool
[07:39:47] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you
[07:40:20] <TheEternalAbyss> i want to make it so it's just a drop and run deal, with different 'themes' i guess
[07:40:26] <paulvd> hello, say i have a div with id="hover" and class="hoverclass", if i do a hover function on #hover, how can i get the class of that div ?
[07:42:09] <Nach0z> paulvd: $('#hover').attr("class")  perhaps
[07:42:10] <TheEternalAbyss> paulvd: why would you need a hover id and class when css has psuedo classes you can use for that purpose?
[07:42:40] <paulvd> TheEternalAbyss: it has many divs not just one
[07:43:18] <TheEternalAbyss> and I sincerely hope that id is use donly once in your html
[07:44:17] <TheEternalAbyss> yea $('#id .class') is how you select id with class
[07:44:22] <airdem> how can i just tell me <input type="file"> that a drag/drop happened and that it should now has this dropped file as selected file?
[07:44:23] <TheEternalAbyss> just like in regular css
[07:46:04] <paulvd> um but i have something else, the ids are unique but classes are different
[07:46:13] <paulvd> ids are same i mean
[07:46:29] <TheEternalAbyss> then you have it reversed
[07:46:57] <NoiseEee> airdem: the idea is to drag the file on an element, not a file <input>... you can never program the value of that
[07:47:15] <NoiseEee> airdem: look into drag/drop upload libraries and see the idea/concept
[07:47:18] <TheEternalAbyss> classes are meant to be repeated and applied to multiple dom objects
[07:47:21] <airdem> NoiseEee, i just found out that most browsers support drag/dropping into the input element
[07:47:25] <TheEternalAbyss> not IDs
[07:49:21] <NoiseEee> airdem: sure, but that's a different concept than real 'drag/drop'. thats more of a browser shortcut
[07:49:37] <NoiseEee> airdem: so it would just fire the 'change' event of the input
[07:49:47] <airdem> NoiseEee, thank you for clarifying
[07:49:51] <airdem> thats exactly what i wanted
[07:49:55] <NoiseEee> yep np
[07:50:25] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/AWLq7/ why does it not show the parent of that img
[07:51:34] <TheEternalAbyss> paulvd: parent of which image
[07:51:44] <paulvd> of that particular image
[07:51:54] <paulvd> i am doing a #right img hover function
[07:52:14] <paulvd> i am trying to grab the value of its parent div class
[07:52:18] <paulvd> swap-1 or swap-2
[07:52:31] <paulvd> and then display the div id with that
[07:52:42] <paulvd> basically full image on hover
[07:53:42] <TheEternalAbyss> wait..
[07:54:11] <TheEternalAbyss> on hover of right img, you want to load what div?
[07:54:25] <paulvd> the left div image of same class
[07:54:33] <grafi> paulvd http://jsfiddle.net/AWLq7/1/ swap-1 swap-2
[07:54:36] <paulvd> you can see #left has same iamge
[07:55:22] <paulvd> grafi: thanks
[07:55:22] <TheEternalAbyss> left is not the parent of right
[07:55:25] <paulvd> trying to learn
[07:55:41] <TheEternalAbyss> if anything they appear to be siblings
[07:55:42] <grafi> start by using console.log instead of alert
[07:55:47] <paulvd> TheEternalAbyss: left and right both has same images, if image hovered on right, will show larger image to the left
[07:55:51] <grafi> and making use of your browser devtools ;)
[07:56:14] <TheEternalAbyss> paulvd: yes but you seem confused as to what is what in html
[07:58:21] <grafi> paulvd http://jsfiddle.net/AWLq7/2/
[07:58:43] <grafi> of course you should maybe overthink how you use ids and classes or something
[07:59:07] <paulvd> grafi: thanks i was close too just that '#' + $class part
[07:59:48] <grafi> yeah it takes a bit of getting used to that stuff ;)
[08:00:45] <paulvd> i have used ids and classes in a wrong way?
[08:01:13] <TheEternalAbyss> if you you use the same id for multiple divs then yes
[08:04:46] <TheEternalAbyss> i don't understand this... setInterval is illogical... how can some variables be used just fine while other are scoped differently though they are all defined and initialized AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME SCOPE. wtf.
[08:08:25] <abes> Question: I have a jquery snippet I reuse from project to project and would like to turn it into a jQuery plugin - how would I go about it?
[08:12:41] <BillCriswell> abes: https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js this is a pretty good pattern... can be much simpler though depending on what it's doing.
[08:18:08] <BillCriswell> abes: You basically want to add it to $.fn so like... $.fn.whatever = function(option){ return this.each(...); }
[08:20:28] <TerianceViernion> sweet biscuits!
[08:23:14] <grafi> holy moly batman
[08:23:22] <BillCriswell> What happened?
[08:23:33] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss whats the reasoning for the two setintervals?
[08:23:34] <grafi> :o
[08:23:54] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/FCYTMWB.gif BillCriswell :p
[08:24:24] <BillCriswell> The things people spend their time on in Photoshop.
[08:24:27] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: it does the loading animation if we want to call it that.
[08:24:50] <grafi> BillCriswell as far as Im concerned this is art :P
[08:25:25] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss but what does the second setinterval do differently than the first :o?
[08:25:39] <jedimind> it does it again, to ensure it happens
[08:25:40] <jedimind> duh
[08:25:44] <TheEternalAbyss> the second one animates the left half
[08:25:45] <jedimind> can never be too careful
[08:25:58] <jedimind> why are people still animating things with javascript?
[08:26:24] <grafi> because they can oô
[08:26:26] <TheEternalAbyss> jedimind: because this is going to eventually be driven by the actual loading process through httprequest monitoring
[08:27:14] <TheEternalAbyss> this is just a guestimate version
[08:29:27] <diegoviola> hi
[08:29:27] <TheEternalAbyss> anyways I'm close to just scrapping the idea anyways. been wasting too much time on this nonsense
[08:30:10] <grafi> and whats with the halt flag?
[08:30:20] <grafi> just trying to understand what you did there :p
[08:30:32] <diegoviola> i have a <select> with many <option>, one of the <option> values is "Other", i would like to have a js that will allow me to execute whatever i want like an alert() when the user clicks on the "Other" option value
[08:30:39] <diegoviola> any ideas how to go in doing this? i'd really appreciate it
[08:31:36] <grafi> diegoviola add a change eventlistener to the select check if the option value is "Other" then do whatever it is you want to do
[08:31:37] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi:  haltFlag is used for me to view the percentage being counted, and use it to trigger events, just as the fadeout I want to do at between 90 and 100 percent
[08:32:25] <TheEternalAbyss> it's called that way cause initially I was halting the entire count, but again, I ran into scoping bs with setInterval and moved on to other ideas, but kept the same variable name
[08:33:17] <grafi> makes sense
[08:33:18] <grafi> :P
[08:34:21] <SprkDev> http://www.w3bees.com/2013/08/image-upload-and-crop-with-jquery-and.html
[08:34:32] <SprkDev> Have problem with the plugin
[08:34:51] <SprkDev> it crops the wrong place of larger pictures. But why?
[08:35:44] <diegoviola> grafi: ok thanks
[08:35:59] <BillCriswell> That site just takes you off the page and does nothing. A hate the internet sometimes.
[08:37:08] <TheEternalAbyss> what I really don't get is how can it use millicount, j, i etc just fine but shit itself on another two variables within the same scope
[08:39:08] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm.. a thought just occurred to me.. brb
[08:40:04] <bberry_> hey guys, i have a question regarding the select2 library.  http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/ I do not want to allow the user to open the select2 box if there is no items in the list.  However, when one is added, i would like the user to then be able to (obviously).  here is my attempt, but it doesnt work... http://jsfiddle.net/z6n5C/
[08:40:37] <bberry_> I haven't found a good way to add variables to the select2 list, so i have to destroy it and recreate it everytime with the new data
[08:43:49] <TheEternalAbyss> ok.. retracted
[08:44:03] <TheEternalAbyss> i was miscalculating... it wasn't a scoping issue
[08:44:16] <musty> hi
[08:44:51] <TheEternalAbyss> my world makes sense again
[08:45:02] <TheEternalAbyss> 'ello musty
[08:45:35] <enoch> hi all
[08:45:53] <musty> Got a bit of a problem with mailchimp's api/jquery. I think my code might be a little incorrect. Do you mind me showing you, TheEternalAbyss?
[08:46:18] <enoch> a question: im working with ui-datepicker and it fires the onSelect event even when the page loads, can i disable it?
[08:46:22] <TheEternalAbyss> i suggest you just ask the chan in general
[08:46:34] <TheEternalAbyss> there's no guarantee I would know how to fix it
[08:46:57] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: I'm sure it's a simple enough problem for anyone that actually knows what they're doing in js.
[08:47:01] <TheEternalAbyss> but sure, paste the link to a fiddle or live example and tell us the problem
[08:47:13] <TheEternalAbyss> musty: i never said I knew what I was doing :P
[08:47:46] <bberry_> How do you undo a prevent default?
[08:48:29] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: The code is here: http://paste.lisp.org/display/140409/raw
[08:48:42] <radicalbiscuit> What would make an input with a keydown binding lose that binding after the input loses focus?
[08:49:07] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: Using chrome's network analyser, there seems to be something causing the "if(jsonData['status'] == 'success'){" line to return null, and fail accordingly.
[08:49:07] <TheEternalAbyss> musty: and what's the problem exactly? do you get an error message?
[08:49:34] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: No, it simply halts.
[08:50:42] <TheEternalAbyss> do you have the html that loads the libraries you use?
[08:50:54] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: Sure. I could paste that, moment.
[08:51:08] <TheEternalAbyss> k
[08:52:11] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: http://codebin.org/view/2a9f6ac1
[08:52:48] <diegoviola> https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/7828171
[08:53:07] <diegoviola> so i have this very simple code here, how do i filter the value, like how do i execute the alert only when value number 4 is selected?
[08:53:13] <diegoviola> sorry for the n00b question... sigh
[08:53:29] <musty> Easier not to ask n00b questions?
[08:53:52] <diegoviola> musty: yeah sure
[08:54:05] <musty> Oh, alright.
[08:54:20] <diegoviola> any ideas though?
[08:59:01] <TheEternalAbyss> musty: still looking at it
[09:00:36] <TheEternalAbyss> musty: is it supposed to output 'sulod'?
[09:01:26] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: To the console? Sure.
[09:01:32] <airdem> how can i create a dynamic property for an object?
[09:01:34] <TheEternalAbyss> yes to the console
[09:01:34] <airdem> {type : state}
[09:01:48] <airdem> i have "var type"
[09:01:52] <Velveeta> airdem: you have to create an empty object first
[09:01:58] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsfiddle.net/L2PjN/ <--musty it runs here. I fixed some errors in the code
[09:02:06] <Velveeta> airdem: var foo = {}; foo[type] = state;
[09:02:15] <TheEternalAbyss> does that do what it's supposed there in the fiddle musty?
[09:03:37] <airdem> Velveeta, thank you a lot
[09:03:42] <Velveeta> no problemo
[09:05:13] <_rgn> OT: is it possible these days to make cross-domain ajax requests without JSONP? I'd like to avoid having a backend that acts as proxy, and have the requests come from the client directly. CORS?
[09:05:15] <tobbi_> Hey. is there a convenient way to send an ajax request to the same page or do I need to enter the URL of the current page?
[09:06:19] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: Meant to change up the form to reflect the approved api call.
[09:06:27] <musty> TheEternalAbyss: See your query, please.
[09:17:20] <Soltis> How would one use $.widget to create a stateful widget with no options?
[09:19:13] <arschmitz> Soltis: thats not possible
[09:19:26] <arschmitz> all widgets have at least the disabled option
[09:19:36] <Soltis> arschmitz: That's what I thought.
[09:20:53] <arschmitz> Soltis: all widgets have the options and methods listed here http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#quick-nav
[09:22:05] <arschmitz> Soltis: you may not implement them so they don't do anything but the "have" them and as a Widget made using the widget factory your kinda breaking a promise made by the factory by not implementing them
[09:28:35] <dijitaltrix> Good morning everyone...
[09:28:49] <Hypnotizes> hii dijenerate
[09:29:07] <dijitaltrix> I'm trying to write my first jQuery plugin using the jQuery boilerplate from github.. but I'm having trouble calling functions within the plugin..
[09:29:39] <dijitaltrix> I've got a basic outline here: http://pastebin.com/cXQeP9cZ
[09:30:07] <dijitaltrix> but whenever I click the button that invokes the code I get an error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'this.opening()'
[09:30:32] <dijitaltrix> I've obviously not got any idea of scope within this plugin layout..
[09:30:51] <dijitaltrix> can someone tell me how to call the function 'opening'?
[09:30:57] <diegoviola> so i have this code here: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/9ac801c9e3b6bd565c8f -- which works fine, it appends an input element when i click on the "other" select option, but how can i tell jquery to remove the element after i clicked in another option that is not "other"?
[09:30:59] <diegoviola> please advice
[09:35:54] <diegoviola> nevermind
[09:36:01] <shoky> dijitaltrix: you can  add this before the .on() call:   var self = this;    and inside the callback:  self.opening();
[09:36:09] <diegoviola> an else with $("#foo").empty() seems like it did the trick
[09:36:31] <diegoviola> i wonder if it's best to use #empty() or #remove()
[09:37:09] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola it depends on what you're doing.
[09:38:25] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: just removing what is inside the element but not the element itself
[09:38:35] <diegoviola> so probably #empty() no?
[09:38:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah iirc .empty() does that.
[09:39:23] <diegoviola> right ty
[09:40:37] <dijitaltrix> shoky thanks so much for that.. I knew my mind was out of sync with the scope somewhere..
[09:42:06] <diegoviola> anything i could improve in this code: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/5f1750e6465339bb2f5a ?

[09:44:43] <mehrdad_> i mean, it's picking errors on the very first line, firefox is
[09:44:55] <mehrdad_> the same site displays fine in IE 10
[09:45:11] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola you're running the empty no matter what - why not do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dpGJ3/
[09:45:16] <mehrdad_> how's that possible ?
[09:46:19] <mehrdad_> i don't understand that
[09:46:50] <duch_kazatel> mehrdad_ did you modify the file in any way?  do you have more than one version of jquery installed?
[09:46:53] <duch_kazatel> are there other plugins?
[09:47:13] <mehrdad_> what could be so different in the two browsers that results in such inconsistencies?
[09:47:27] <duch_kazatel> i'd start by creating a basic test page with just that copy of jquery and a basic html wrapper and see what happens there.
[09:47:28] <mehrdad_> there are other plugins , but they are loaded after the query one
[09:47:44] <mehrdad_> also as said, the same site works fine in IE

[09:48:08] <mehrdad_> with ff
[09:48:18] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: cool, that's better
[09:48:20] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: thanks
[09:48:21] <shoky> heh
[09:48:28] <shoky> jquery in chinese
[09:48:34] <duch_kazatel> mehrdad_ you have some encoding problems.
[09:48:54] <mehrdad_> hmm
[09:49:08] <mehrdad_> how is it working in IE then?
[09:49:15] <mehrdad_> but that's a good hint
[09:49:25] <mehrdad_> i'm gonna check that, thanks
[09:49:57] <duch_kazatel> IE might be doing something it shouldn;t.
[09:49:59] <duch_kazatel> who knows
[09:54:00] <mehrdad_> i don't tend to bash IE based on 4 experience of 4 versions before
[09:54:13] <mehrdad_> extra 4 there
[09:56:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm not bashing it - lots of browsers aren't compliant.
[09:57:30] <mehrdad_> i checked the encoding and it looks fine >> <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
[09:57:57] <duch_kazatel> are the files ACTUALLY UTF-8?
[09:59:41] <mehrdad_> not sure
[09:59:54] <mehrdad_> do you mean the jquery file?
[10:00:05] <duch_kazatel> yes
[10:00:17] <duch_kazatel> and everything else - I got a bunch of invalid character warnings when I opened the page
[10:02:03] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss still around, have you figured your problem out already?
[10:02:46] <mehrdad_> setting charset="UTF-8" on the script tags now
[10:03:01] <duch_kazatel> mehrdad_ that does not make the files UTF_8
[10:03:05] <duch_kazatel> *UTF-8
[10:03:11] <duch_kazatel> you need to open them and ensure the actual file encodings.
[10:03:20] <mehrdad_> but i'm seeing changes in the errors now
[10:03:40] <duch_kazatel> you're seeing different errors?
[10:04:36] <duch_kazatel> because that doens't mean you're actually fixing anything ;)
[10:05:19] <mehrdad_> no
[10:05:20] <mehrdad_> it worked
[10:05:28] <duch_kazatel> hah really?
[10:05:29] <mehrdad_> no js errors now
[10:05:29] <mehrdad_> just css ones now
[10:05:35] <mehrdad_> yeah
[10:05:48] <mehrdad_> it seems ff doesn't work in utf by default
[10:06:02] <duch_kazatel> because the file encodings are probably wrong.
[10:06:04] <mehrdad_> i meant unicode
[10:06:06] <duch_kazatel> you should still verify those.
[10:06:09] <duch_kazatel> ah
[10:06:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah either wya
[10:06:25] <mehrdad_> the files are just fine
[10:06:35] <mehrdad_> it's cured now anyway
[10:06:50] <mehrdad_> now there's a big layout problem
[10:07:04] <mehrdad_> still a FF issue
[10:07:06] <duch_kazatel> lol i still think you need to fix the files themselves, but glad that helped.
[10:07:10] <mehrdad_> <3 IE
[10:07:18] * mehrdad_ takes cover
[10:07:21] <duch_kazatel> IE is OK.
[10:08:38] <mehrdad_> is there such a setting for css files too?
[10:08:43] <mehrdad_> charset etc ?
[10:09:06] <mehrdad_> it looks like to be of the same kind of issue as the jquery one
[10:09:16] <mehrdad_> it can't parse past the first line of the css
[10:09:26] <rainabba> I'd go so far as to say that IE11 is "OK" but still not a browser I would use unless required.
[10:11:30] <mehrdad_> as long as developers and designers are concerned, i'd say it's more than decent now
[10:14:07] <shoky> mehrdad_ maybe the issue was your <meta> tag,  <meta content="utf-8" name="content-type" />
[10:15:56] <shoky> oh you've tried changing it i see, nevermind
[10:16:30] <mehrdad_> yeah that was a goof
[10:17:50] <mehrdad_> now can you please have a look at it again? there are similar css errors now
[10:18:16] <raj> hello mr. shoky
[10:18:33] <bberry_> Let's say i have var arr1 = [...some data];  Is there a way to add a callback function whenever the array is changed (ie data is pushed, deleted, modified, etc)?
[10:18:54] <rainabba> It seems that in some cases if I want to use data(), I can chain it behind a selector like $(this).parents('div[foo]').data() and in other cases, I have to wrap my target first like $($(this).parents('div[foo]')).data()  Anyone know why that might be? Almost seems like certain versions of IE require it and newer ones don't (and Chrome doesn't) but I'm not positive if that's the variable or
[10:18:54] <rainabba> something entirely different (like calling .data() is valid in same cases but not others)?
[10:20:13] <duch_kazatel> bberry_ not without an extra lib/framework.
[10:20:15] <duch_kazatel> like backbone.
[10:24:21] <enape_101> why isn't this working? (timepicker) https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/7820249
[10:26:13] <rainabba> enape_101: jsfiddle test?
[10:26:33] <bberry_> duch_kazatel: :( do you know of one by chance?
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> bberry_ backbone lol
[10:27:04] <bberry_> duch_kazatel: oh haha missed that 2nd post >.<
[10:27:17] <duch_kazatel> bberry_ backbone is a full framework though.  it's an MVC, basically.
[10:27:37] <duch_kazatel> so that might not be the best option.
[10:27:41] <bberry_> yeah. blegh...
[10:27:59] <bberry_> i might not need something that is quite that robust. ill make a jsfiddle to explain further
[10:28:29] <duch_kazatel> why not just create your own proxy functions and call those instead of the native ones?
[10:28:39] <duch_kazatel> and have that do your callback + array work?
[10:29:21] <bberry_> yeah thats what i was thinking as well. its kind of what i have already.
[10:30:51] <enape_101> thanks rainabba, it's just difficult to replicate it because i'm using a database, time field
[10:32:01] <rainabba> enape_101: Difficult to help then. "Why isn't this working" can mean just about anything and even if you're specific about what, your use-case could provide another near-infinite number of variables.
[10:32:19] <enape_101> rainabba, fair enough
[10:32:55] <enape_101> rainabba, not sure if this helps http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20431043/timepicker-not-working-on-rails-app#20431043
[10:32:58] <sparr> http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/9/ How can I change the alert from "7" to "9" with a userscript (that is, only by adding javascript outside of the existing script, not by modifying it)?
[10:33:01] <enape_101> probably not :(
[10:34:58] <rainabba> enape_101: Not really. jQueryUI has a built in picker and it's quite straight-forward to use (has nothing to do with back-end) so what ever you're dealing with is likely specific to your use case. Model it is jsFiddle and either you'll figure it out in the attempt or you'll replicate it and we can help.
[10:38:40] <SteveBenner9> Hey so has anyone here had epxerience with Effeckt.css?
[10:38:56] <SteveBenner9> (brand new amazing animation lib by paul irish)
[10:39:01] <SteveBenner9> (and others)
[10:39:59] <enape_101> alright
[10:43:35] <rainabba> enape_101: One thing I'd suggest from the start that will both simplify your issue AND help pull you away from the proprietary server-side code would be to use your <%%> tags to build up a client-side JS object then go from there. This way you focus and minimize your server-side code and your client-side code becomes less fragile, easier to debug, less dependent on your server code, etc...
[10:44:41] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: yea it works. I was miscalculating
[10:45:17] <grafi> what exactly?
[10:45:44] <rainabba> So long as you're using stuff like <%= f.input_field :location...%>, you don't even have reliable client code because what gets generated could change from an INPUT to a SPAN with pseudo INPUT behavior, etc...
[10:45:50] <TheEternalAbyss> turns out, the scoping was correct, I was transitioning to fast in a too small interval, so it was visually impossible to see
[10:46:59] * rainabba is ditching the "ASP" part of ASP.Net for this reason and using it only for the data layer of his apps and more general stuff like master-pages. Even then, that will be eliminated in favor of JS templating.
[10:47:10] <shoky> hey raj
[10:48:16] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss yeah 30ms is not much time, anyways you still using 2 interval thingies?
[10:48:57] <TheEternalAbyss> yes, that's the only way to create the animation illusion the way I want it right now
[10:49:24] <TheEternalAbyss> eventually I'll have it tie into the request processes
[10:49:59] <Syrit> Guys, i have one partial, and in thta partial i am attahcing on click event to an input, now , this partial is rendered tiwce, and if i click on the first partial, the action is trigered twice, what am doing wrong ?
[10:50:09] <TheEternalAbyss> if i decide to pursue this idea further
[10:50:14] <grafi> i played around abit and simplified some things, maybe you find it helpful http://jsfiddle.net/ZEBLn/
[10:52:06] <TheEternalAbyss> that's simplifying?
[10:52:16] <grafi> i think so
[10:52:16] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[10:52:34] <grafi> setup got a lot easier
[10:52:55] <grafi> and it doesnt need the whole interval ordeal anymore
[10:53:15] <TheEternalAbyss> well I'm sure it's more efficient since you don't have multi setIntervals
[10:54:13] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: this took you how long? just curious
[10:54:36] <grafi> roughly an hour, on and off
[10:54:50] <TheEternalAbyss> i see
[10:55:09] <TheEternalAbyss> sometimes I wonder why I even got into programming..
[10:55:51] <grafi> that sounds depressing :P
[10:56:22] <grafi> nothing better than fiddling around with something x)
[10:56:36] <Guest90610> how to add multiple css styles like .css('background-color','#d3d3d3');?
[10:56:55] <TheEternalAbyss> well when someone on irc does in an hour what i've been doing in days... well that's not entirely true, I got the main thing working in about an hour too, I've just been tweaking and playing with it for days to do what I want to with it... still...
[10:57:04] <grafi> Guest90610 .css({background: '})
[10:57:06] <TheEternalAbyss> mine's shit in comparison
[10:57:07] <grafi> waaagh
[10:57:20] <grafi> Guest90610 .css({background: 'red', color: 'blue'})
[10:58:06] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss its mostly just restructuring what was already there
[10:58:22] <grafi> so of course thats quicker than tweaking, creating from scratch
[10:58:52] <Guest90610> thx
[10:59:34] <TheEternalAbyss> well I have a meeting to go to.. later
[10:59:48] <grafi> have fun *evil laugh* meetings are fun right?
[10:59:49] <grafi> xD
[11:01:03] <duch_kazatel> ugh
[11:07:50] <Guest90610> grafi,  .css({background-color: 'red', color: 'blue'})      gives error because of "-" saying  SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[11:08:27] <grafi> Guest90610 i think you can either use 'background-color' or backgroundColor in those cases
[11:08:32] <duch_kazatel> Guest12834 .css({'background-color': 'red', color: 'blue'})
[11:08:50] <grafi> duch_kazatel highlighting random guests xD
[11:09:01] <Guest90610> hm
[11:09:12] <duch_kazatel> err woops.
[11:09:14] <duch_kazatel> ugh guests

[11:09:32] <duch_kazatel> also: ugh coldfusion.
[11:09:37] <grafi> coldfusion
[11:09:37] <duch_kazatel> i can't believe this is still a language.
[11:10:09] <grafi> latin is still a language
[11:10:10] <grafi> xD
[11:10:31] <Sh0rtWave> Anyone here use JQuery with Drupal? Specifically D7, with Jquery Update module pushing to JQ 1.8?
[11:10:51] <duch_kazatel> grafi yeah but Latin served a purpose once.
[11:11:03] <grafi> i imagine so did coldfusion?
[11:11:04] <grafi> xD
[11:11:08] <duch_kazatel> helll no.
[11:11:12] <grafi> hahaha
[11:17:37] <limpc> i have a pretty bad problem with my app.. we're creating a mood board.. it works great, but it seems if i add alot of images to the board, and reload the page, the images are all over the place. like a tornado came in there
[11:17:58] <grafi> that must be a feature
[11:18:00] <limpc> im saving the board by just saving the html container
[11:18:17] <limpc> however it works fine if you re-arrange the photos after reload
[11:18:25] <limpc> subsequent reloads show the images fine.
[11:18:39] <limpc> but if you add another image it gets blown up again.. im at a loss as to what could be causing this behavior
[11:18:44] <grafi> so only on first reload does it not work?
[11:18:52] <grafi> hm
[11:18:53] <limpc> yeah.  or anytime a new image is added
[11:19:00] <grafi> example somewhere?
[11:19:30] <limpc> http://mdw.profferlabs.com/?x=y
[11:19:41] <limpc> click on the 'images' label and click to add another image to it.
[11:19:50] <limpc> when you reload the images will be scattered
[11:20:31] <limpc> this is just a demo, not a final product, so the code's a bit messy
[11:21:17] <grafi> seems to work fine for me, the images stay in place
[11:21:23] <limpc> did you add another image?
[11:21:38] <grafi> yup
[11:21:58] <limpc> try it again
[11:22:06] <grafi> ok
[11:22:10] <limpc> i just did it here and the images shifted to the right (and one was outside the container) when i reloaded
[11:22:36] <grafi> oh yeah now i see it
[11:22:55] <limpc> bummer. i was hoping maybe it was just me lol
[11:23:01] <limpc> so any idea whats going on there?
[11:27:07] <grafi> hm no idea at all

[11:43:37] <superhans> Hi everyone... new to js/jquery and need help with a very basic task... i have an array with 2 objects in it and each object got 2 properties... i want to do a for-loop through this array and create a <div> for each object, and then i want to create <h1>-tags for each property, inside the divs...  any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/XnB2J/
[11:45:55] <joroci> superhans
[11:46:00] <joroci> creare the html you want
[11:46:05] <joroci> in the fiddle
[11:46:55] <limpc> hmm
[11:47:07] <limpc> so it seems like jquery .draggable() is setting the image position to 'relative'
[11:47:11] <limpc> how do i stop this from happening?
[11:47:29] <superhans> joroci, i want to create the div's and h1's with jquery aswell if possible
[11:47:30] <limpc> i already have css: .draggable { position: absolute; }
[11:47:35] <superhans> was thinking append or appendto
[11:47:55] <joroci> yea
[11:47:59] <limpc> but on inspecting the element in the DOM inspector, it shows the element is given css attribute "position: relative"
[11:48:23] <joroci> you mean
[11:48:34] <joroci> <div><h1></h1><h1></h1></div>
[11:48:34] <joroci> ?
[11:49:02] <superhans> yea... a div for each object and inside that div the objects properties
[11:49:02] <grafi> limpc to hack something together maybe use !important in the css, but of course that generally a bad idea
[11:49:35] <Sh0rtWave> I'm using Drupal with Jquery 1.8, and I'm running into a strange problem with timepickers or any other "popup" kind of content editor.
[11:49:37] <Sh0rtWave> http://www.stormwind-studios.com/skitch/TimepickerIssue-20131206-144717.jpg
[11:50:04] <BillCriswell> I love CSS transitions.
[11:50:07] <grafi> Sh0rtWave no stylesheet?
[11:50:07] <limpc> hmm !important works.
[11:50:21] <Sh0rtWave> I've tried 4 or 5 separate timepickers and get the same problem each time. All the time picker's content items show up at the bottom of the page, instead of where they're supposed to be.
[11:50:25] <Sh0rtWave> grafi: You'd think that.
[11:50:32] <grafi> it looks like it
[11:50:33] <grafi> ;)
[11:50:39] <grafi> BillCriswell why?
[11:50:45] <Sh0rtWave> grafi: but no. Even trying $("#something").tabs(); has a horrible effect.
[11:50:56] <BillCriswell> grafi: Just make shit so much easier.
[11:51:23] <grafi> Sh0rtWave that still doesnt exlude missing stylesheets from being the cause
[11:51:28] <grafi> BillCriswell :D
[11:51:44] <grafi> BillCriswell what are you making?
[11:51:46] <limpc> grafi, ty for the suggestion
[11:51:54] <grafi> limpc no problemo
[11:52:05] <Sh0rtWave> grafi: They don't appear to be the cause however.
[11:52:07] <obert> do you know a script to cover css3 flexbox browsers support?
[11:52:24] <BillCriswell> grafi: Just a site for work. Nothing too interesting sadly.
[11:52:32] <grafi> Sh0rtWave what makes you say that?
[11:52:54] <grafi> BillCriswell at least you get paid
[11:52:54] <grafi> :p
[11:53:09] <Sh0rtWave> grafi: The existence of styles in the document on other elements that share rules.
[11:53:29] <grafi> other timepickers on the page work then?
[11:53:36] <Sh0rtWave> No
[11:53:46] <Sh0rtWave> That's not what I'm saying.
[11:53:47] <grafi> i dont see what css would be shared then
[11:53:58] <Sh0rtWave> The timer picker in question doesn't actually use a .css file, in that case.
[11:54:21] <grafi> have an example online?
[11:54:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: True! It's fun code wise but the content doesn't really interest me at least.
[11:54:52] <grafi> sure, when is content ever interesting :p
[12:03:54] <gremlyn1> anyone worked with the jquery ui labeled sliders extension (https://github.com/bseth99/jquery-ui-extensions) ?
[12:06:05] <Sh0rtWave> grafi: So, I've tested it. I can see the stylesheets loading in the network inspector in Firebug, so I KNOW they're loading. I can see the browser actually asking for them, and their content appears to be loading correctly.
[12:06:30] <grafi> thats the right answer ;)
[12:06:45] <grafi> doesnt help you sadly ^^
[12:06:51] <joroci> superhans?
[12:07:42] <Sh0rtWave> ARRGH
[12:07:47] <Sh0rtWave> I am so frustrated.

[12:09:07] <Sh0rtWave> I don't even know where to look for a problem now.
[12:09:09] <iwantoski> What's a nice/clean way of "compiling" a DOM form element (and all its related children) into a JSON formated string?
[12:09:17] <Sh0rtWave> It seems as if there are missing styles, but I verified that to not be the case.
[12:09:34] <iwantoski> (I know I could just loop through each field and creating an object - but I feel this has been done before (wouldn't want to re-invent the wheel)
[12:09:38] <superhans> joroci: thanks alot!
[12:09:48] <joroci> iwantoski i think you can use the serialize method
[12:10:01] <iwantoski> joroci: Thanks, I'll take a look
[12:10:23] <joroci> np
[12:18:40] <Sh0rtWave> Hrm
[12:18:49] <Sh0rtWave> I just don't think it's missing styles.
[12:19:05] <Sh0rtWave> I can add elements to the page, and assign a style from the stylesheet that affects that timepicker, and it picks up the style as it should.
[12:29:26] <Sh0rtWave> http://www.stormwind-studios.com/skitch/JQuery_Error-20131206-152902.jpg
[12:29:29] <Sh0rtWave> There we go
[12:29:32] <Sh0rtWave> Behold that.
[12:29:45] <Sh0rtWave> It screams something to do with styles, but I'll be damned if I know what.
[12:30:59] <Sh0rtWave> For the departure time field, the measurements on CP_hourcont appear to be correct.
[12:31:10] <Sh0rtWave> And the styles look right, at least the colors are correct.
[12:31:52] <joroci> what's the problem?
[12:31:57] <Sh0rtWave> Where things are showing up.
[12:32:08] <Sh0rtWave> It LOOKS and ACTS as if it's a missing style issue, but I can see the styles loading.
[12:32:30] <joroci> is there a live website?
[12:32:40] <Sh0rtWave> Not that I can show anyone yet.
[12:32:43] <Sh0rtWave> NDAs and all.
[12:32:48] <Sh0rtWave> They're most irritiating.
[12:35:44] <Sh0rtWave> I'm sure it's got something to do with how Drupal manages JS & styles, but it's hard to narrow down where it's failing. I think it's probably a silent error somewhere that's getting caught and not reported.

[12:43:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont hav the time right now for next few days but will learn towards end of next week
[12:43:54] <grafi> thats fine ;)
[12:44:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> until then if you wanna continue working maybe add some grid stuff
[12:44:01] <grafi> but it looks good now right?
[12:44:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> be my guest
[12:44:05] <grafi> im proud :P
[12:44:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah
[12:44:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> ie looks great too
[12:44:13] <grafi> yeah
[12:44:19] <grafi> im must be a wizard
[12:44:21] <grafi> idk
[12:44:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> it still sucks that anti aliasing in chrome is fucked up but thats okay
[12:44:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol yes you  are :P
[12:44:42] <joroci> damn
[12:44:52] <joroci> i'm tired
[12:45:49] <thinkxl> what is the vanilla JS equivalent to $.fn for example if I want to do a Vanilla JS Plugin ?
[12:45:54] <RavenHursT> Can anyone help me out w/ the jquery ui widget question?
[12:46:13] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui it is?
[12:46:20] <grafi> same spot?
[12:46:21] <grafi> oô
[12:46:49] <grafi> chrome looks fine to me
[12:46:50] <grafi> :o
[12:48:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[12:48:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> the fotns im talking about
[12:48:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> they look shit if you remove webkit-text-stroke
[12:48:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[12:48:39] <grafi> so dont remove text stroke
[12:48:40] <grafi> xD
[12:56:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but see how nicely antialiasinged it is in ie
[12:56:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> the font looks fat in chrome
[12:56:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> detracts frot he beauty
[12:56:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> from the beauty
[12:56:43] <RavenHursT> Does anyone know how to bind specific events to a custom jQueryUi widget for showing and hiding, etc?
[12:56:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[12:57:10] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui meh
[12:57:11] <joroci> RavenHursT
[12:57:11] <grafi> :p
[12:57:16] <joroci> which plugin?
[12:57:20] <joroci> i mean widget
[12:57:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol, text stroke makes it look fine I guess
[12:57:44] <grafi> ^^
[12:57:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways, grafi why dont you get started on that grid
[12:57:46] <RavenHursT> joroci: I'm trying to figure out how this one did it: https://github.com/mar10/jquery-ui-contextmenu/blob/master/jquery.ui-contextmenu.js
[12:57:59] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui i have though about that a bit
[12:58:06] <grafi> but im really not sure what i want
[12:58:08] <grafi> and how i want it
[12:58:10] <grafi> ^^
[12:58:15] <jedimind> antialiasinged
[12:58:17] <jedimind> ""
[12:58:26] <grafi> jedimind is antialised too
[12:58:40] <RavenHursT> joroci: been reading for hours and I'm not seeing how it's done... it's basically piggy-backing on the ui-menu widget for the menu itself.. but I can't, for the life of me figure out how he's gone about binding the right-click event to the "delegate"
[12:58:45] <RavenHursT> driving me mad
[12:58:45] <jedimind> yup im super smooth around the edges
[12:58:47] <jedimind> *wink*
[12:59:29] <joroci> wait i'm not sure what problem
[12:59:30] <joroci> ?
[12:59:36] <joroci> is
[12:59:41] <joroci> bahh what is the problem?
[13:00:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: well look at lemonade for inspiration
[13:00:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> apparently they have a kick ass grid system
[13:00:44] <grafi> http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0010/00000000010/1024x1024/Salbei_Minz_Limonade_ff499bbb128197f17e8c4849cf246d93_viva2006100251.jpg
[13:00:49] <grafi> lemonade?
[13:00:50] <grafi> xD
[13:01:07] <joroci> RavenHursT?
[13:01:20] <RavenHursT> joroci: I'm trying to figure out how it's done.. I'm using that context menu in an app that I'm building.. but I want to be able to open it w/ a left-click or a custom .on() event.. but I need to figure out how it's bound to the right-click event first before I can change it..
[13:02:43] <RavenHursT> joroci: I'm assuming, since it's using the UI-widget framework, there must be a way to tie events to the widget, but I'm only seeing internal event api's in the jquery-ui widget docs..
[13:03:15] <joroci> you can just call the show method?
[13:03:22] <joroci> for the event you create
[13:04:04] <RavenHursT> joroci: ok.. but how do I keep it from firing on right-click then?
[13:04:15] <RavenHursT> does it have something to do w/ line 81?
[13:04:19] <joroci> oh you want to open it just with left click?
[13:04:26] <RavenHursT> joroci: yeah..
[13:04:43] <RavenHursT> essentially override it's "trigger" w/ my own..
[13:04:49] <weeb1e_> Can anyone tell me if an element is required to be attached to the DOM before you can use data() to set a data attributes value to an object?
[13:05:16] <ph88> weeb1e_: don't think so
[13:06:02] <jasonmerino> weeb1e_: If you have a reference to a doc fragment you can attach data to it through `.data()`
[13:06:11] <weeb1e_> ph88: I was setting a data("nickname", nickname), but after changing it to data("user", user) where user is an object, the data attribute is null even though printing out the user object when it is set shows user is not null
[13:06:35] <weeb1e_> My best guess is that it is because the element is not yet attached to the DOM when the "user" data attribute is set
[13:06:50] <jedimind> grafi that is the worst resolution, slowest loading image ive seen since 1994 porn
[13:07:06] <nolsen> weeb1e_ can I see your code?
[13:07:13] <grafi> i just googled lemonade
[13:07:15] <grafi> ^^
[13:07:38] <weeb1e_> nolsen: I'd have to try turn it into a minimal test case, to try reproduce this exact issue without all the other unrelated code
[13:08:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lemonade is suppose to be good i meant
[13:08:36] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui have you looked at it :o
[13:08:52] <grafi> looks super simple
[13:08:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: once or twice though i prefer one from scratch
[13:08:57] <grafi> its literally 100lines css
[13:09:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh any the anti aliasing on fonts makes me want to cry
[13:09:32] <grafi> switch to mac
[13:09:33] <grafi> :P
[13:09:47] <grafi> pick fonts that look normal
[13:09:48] <grafi> ...
[13:09:50] <grafi> idk
[13:09:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol must look even more beautiful
[13:10:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[13:10:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi i told you look to it for inspiration
[13:10:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> its good we nee to make it even simpler
[13:10:21] <grafi> i do, dont pressure me
[13:10:22] <grafi> :P
[13:10:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> like for exmaple
[13:10:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> if they dont specify class on parent
[13:10:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> then automatically resize equally
[13:10:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> this project would also be a good time to use flexbox if we want
[13:11:00] <grafi> not sure how that would work
[13:11:00] <grafi> ^^
[13:11:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[13:11:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> well we can use js for that
[13:11:11] <grafi> yeah but flexbox is complicated
[13:11:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> or sass if it permits for
[13:11:16] <grafi> old version new version bla version
[13:11:17] <grafi> :(
[13:11:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:11:26] <grafi> js is not for grids
[13:11:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you figure it out
[13:11:32] <grafi> sure
[13:11:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> im just throwing ideas out there :p
[13:11:41] <grafi> stupid ideas
[13:11:42] <grafi> :Pü
[13:11:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> hence why i said figure it out
[13:12:02] <grafi> [22:11:23] <grafi> sure
[13:12:10] <grafi> [22:10:12] <grafi> dont pressure me
[13:12:11] <grafi> :D
[13:12:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: dont know if your a soccer nut but: http://wpmedia.sports.nationalpost.com/2013/12/worldcup-2.jpg?w=416&h=500
[13:12:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol XD
[13:12:42] <RavenHursT> joroci: Any ideas?
[13:13:55] <joroci> checking
[13:16:23] <RavenHursT> joroci: Thanks
[13:16:44] <MarkyC> Hey all, I'm trying to set a larger image to a smaller images src when the smaller image is clicked on. Here's my jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/4K2pV/. I know it's not right, I'm still trying to get used to jQuery
[13:17:33] <MarkyC> I think I need to use parent() twice to get the top level div?
[13:17:46] <RavenHursT> joroci: line 153 is the method called to open the menu... but I'm failing to see how or where that is called when you right-click on an element.. it's working http://morf.captora.com/http://www.captora.com  so I know it's there somewhere.. just not seeing it..
[13:18:30] <jasonmerino> MarkyC: You could add a class or ID and use .closest(class/id) instead of .parent().parent(). That makes changing markup a little more flexible.
[13:19:23] <MarkyC> jasonmerino: wouldn't closest just find the child img of the a element?
[13:19:46] <jasonmerino> MarkyC: closest goes up the tree.
[13:19:52] <MarkyC> Oh, nevermind I just had a moment
[13:19:56] <jasonmerino> :)
[13:20:01] <jasonmerino> I have those all the time.
[13:20:03] <MarkyC> jasonmerino: thank you.
[13:20:14] <jasonmerino> MarkyC: Yup yup!
[13:22:51] <joroci> i think there is an option you can set
[13:23:00] <joroci> so it will use left click
[13:23:31] <glaksmono> any thoughts on executing swipe event on swipe distance?
[13:24:01] <MarkyC> jasonmerino: I think I'm close: http://jsfiddle.net/4K2pV/1/ . The src does not get set when I click.
[13:25:40] <MarkyC> sorry, it should be getting set by the a's href, not its src. But is still doesn't work just yet: http://jsfiddle.net/4K2pV/2/
[13:31:12] <joroci> markalanevans
[13:31:13] <joroci> MarkyC
[13:31:19] <joroci> what are you trying to do/
[13:31:19] <joroci> ?
[13:31:56] <MarkyC> I want to set img.main's src to the href of the anchor in div.alt-view
[13:32:02] <MarkyC> on click
[13:32:43] <joroci> why use closest?
[13:32:48] <MarkyC> So if there are two anchors in div.alt-view, it set's the src of img.main to the one that was clicked
[13:33:09] <MarkyC> joroci: because of jasonmerino
[13:33:13] <MarkyC> 's suggestion*
[13:33:15] <joroci> i' guessing there is only one big image?
[13:33:26] <joroci> and these are thumbnails?
[13:33:30] <MarkyC> joroci: one per div wrapper
[13:34:09] <joroci> so few galleries?
[13:34:17] <MarkyC> joroci: I would prefer not to use ID's because I may have multiple rows with img.main
[13:34:31] <MarkyC> joroci: Here's an example: http://fc.vaughanstar.com/cabinets/geneva/base
[13:35:09] <MarkyC> joroci: when I click the small images with the red border, I want the larger image above it to change to that image
[13:35:23] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/4K2pV/3/ MarkyC
[13:36:14] <MarkyC> grafi: That makes sense. the img is a sibling of the div (the a's parent)
[13:36:23] <MarkyC> grafi: thank you
[13:43:23] <RavenHursT> joroci: what option?  I'm not seeing any kind of "trigger" option on there..
[14:17:00] <ajustrun> anyone know what the difference is between $('#id.class') and $('.class#id')
[14:17:27] <Velveeta> you can try writing a jsperf to test, but i don't think either of those are going to be more/less performant than the other
[14:17:43] <Velveeta> they should both be optimized away to use just the id selector, since it should be unique in the document
[14:17:44] <ajustrun> well one is working and one isnt
[14:17:45] <ajustrun> #id.class is the only one that works
[14:17:53] <Velveeta> interesting
[14:17:57] <ajustrun> id selector isnt unique =/ cause im bad at jquery
[14:17:59] <thesisb> From a finding an element perspective, #id.class is considered better, but since you should only have one id per page you can just do $('#id').
[14:18:24] <Velveeta> being bad at jquery isn't an excuse for a non-unique id selector, that's html spec itself, not jquery or even javascript in general ;)
[14:18:26] <ajustrun> i messed up and have multiple ids
[14:18:29] <thesisb> from a coding perspective, you might have a ul with a bunch of li class='class' but only one with id='id' so you'd logically write it the second way
[14:18:37] <ajustrun> yeah i just messed up
[14:18:47] <ajustrun> maybe i should rewrite
[14:18:52] <thesisb> you should rewrite
[14:18:54] <shoky> s/maybe/
[14:18:56] <ajustrun> hahaha
[14:18:59] <Velveeta> shoky: lol
[14:19:17] <ajustrun> refactoring it is!
[14:19:39] <Velveeta> however, to answer your side question, i'm not sure why #id.class would work and .class#id wouldn't
[14:19:45] <Velveeta> that sounds like more of a bug in the selector parser
[14:19:51] <ajustrun> yeah especially since its only one element that is failing
[14:19:56] <shoky> prolly .class#id looks for the class and then filters by id ?
[14:20:01] <thesisb> ^
[14:20:12] <Velveeta> well he said one works and the other doesn't
[14:20:14] <ajustrun> but that should work too
[14:20:14] <ajustrun> cause per class i only have one id
[14:20:17] <Velveeta> they should both return the same node
[14:20:26] <Velveeta> oh wait a minute
[14:20:27] <thesisb> the other fails maybe because you should only have 1 id
[14:20:29] <shoky> yeah and #id.class  does getElementById which returns the wrong one
[14:20:30] <thesisb> and it stops at 1
[14:20:40] <ajustrun> no #id.class works
[14:20:44] <shoky> o
[14:20:46] <Velveeta> you said that id is non-unique, is the first instance of that id on an element that's not of .class class?
[14:20:50] <ajustrun> .class#id fails
[14:21:04] <shoky> still, something like that ;p
[14:21:14] <Velveeta> i wonder if maybe for #id.class, it's scrapping the .class part of the search and just going with #id
[14:21:14] <ajustrun> Velveeta: i dont understand the last part
[14:21:15] <ajustrun> i have two things
[14:21:23] <ajustrun> #31.top
[14:21:25] <ajustrun> #31.bottom
[14:21:29] <thesisb> probably because it finds all classes, then in the each looks for the id and when it finds it smartly breaks out of the loop since its an id and there is only 1
[14:21:37] <thesisb> whereas $('#id...) just finds all
[14:21:44] <Velveeta> and for .class#id it's finding all elements of .class name, and then finding the element of #id and using that as a filter against the list of .class elements
[14:21:46] <ajustrun> .bottom#31 does not work, #31.bottom works
[14:22:04] <Velveeta> and if the first instance of #id is not also of .class, it wouldn't find it in that list of .class elements, and returns nothing
[14:22:18] <ajustrun> oh that makes sense
[14:22:26] <Velveeta> so yeah, what thesisb said
[14:22:41] <ajustrun> ohh i get it
[14:22:50] <Velveeta> it's just a theory, but one that happens to fit the use case
[14:22:51] <ajustrun> so have unique ids isnt so much of a suggestion as a necessity
[14:22:55] <thesisb> tl;dr only 1 id per page
[14:23:00] <Velveeta> well, it's part of the spec itself
[14:23:08] <Velveeta> id's are always supposed to be unique, period
[14:23:09] <ajustrun> oh i didnt know that
[14:23:21] <Velveeta> think of it like an object map of like { a: true, b: false, c: true, d: false }
[14:23:36] <shoky> think of it like an id. you don't share your id with another person
[14:23:41] <thesisb> its not that things break, jquery is just making a performance enhancement based on an assumption which should hold true in all cases where the code follows the spec :/
[14:23:45] <Velveeta> you can only have 1 of any given key in that, and they're indexed by that for speedy lookup
[14:23:46] <shoky> it's your identity, your unique id.
[14:23:55] <Velveeta> right
[14:24:00] <ajustrun> yeah that all makes sense, i need to refactor
[14:24:20] <ajustrun> thanks guys i appreciate the help
[14:24:32] <Velveeta> anytime…….. that we're awake
[14:24:37] <Velveeta> …….and paying attention to the room

[14:47:44] <thesisb> brilliant
[14:50:28] <Fishbowne> anyone mind if I ask a JSON question ?
[14:50:36] <grafi> i what i are saying am is
[14:51:08] <Fishbowne> how come in JSON object access you have to put the number and space between brackets ?
[14:51:30] <grafi> hm=
[14:51:32] <Fishbowne> for example obj.array[ 3 ].item   but obj.array[3].item doesn't ?
[14:51:48] <grafi> that doesnt sound right
[14:52:08] <Fishbowne> first example works, 2nd doesn't
[14:52:15] <grafi> show you json
[14:52:19] <Fishbowne> 2nd causes browser to shit its pants.
[14:52:34] <grafi> with what error message?
[14:52:47] <Fishbowne> han gon
[14:53:06] <grafi> yep han is gone
[14:53:51] <Fishbowne> oaky well now im confused... sudddenly both work
[14:53:54] <Fishbowne> WTF.
[14:54:02] <grafi> glad i could fix that for you
[14:54:09] <Fishbowne> ...
[14:54:10] <grafi> you're welcome
[14:54:32] <Fishbowne> how do i test for another object in an JSON object ?
[14:54:43] <Fishbowne> like if Im iterating through and suddenly object, what is the test /
[14:55:06] <Fishbowne> also how do you know if an array is single value or key pairs ?
[14:55:42] <grafi> so many questions
[15:00:31] <Fishbowne> its 2 basically.
[15:00:46] <grafi> ha
[15:01:09] <Fishbowne> how to test for "object" in an object, and how to differentiate between array of keypairs or single values
[15:02:25] <grafi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8511281/check-if-a-variable-is-an-object
[15:02:57] <grafi> also nothing like keypair array stuff, dont do it
[15:03:21] <Fishbowne> say what ?
[15:03:49] <Fishbowne> when transversing unkown JSON objects, they could potentially contain single array value.
[15:03:55] <Fishbowne> unknown.
[15:04:19] <shoky> stop calling them JSON objects
[15:04:30] <shoky> they are javascript objects
[15:06:14] <Fishbowne> every website out there calls them JSON.
[15:06:17] <shoky> objects contain key:value pairs. arrays contain index:value pairs
[15:06:22] <shoky> wrong
[15:06:38] <shoky> every blog out there maybe
[15:06:50] <Fishbowne> a blog is a website.
[15:06:56] <iwantoski> Fishbowne: JSON is an object notation represented in printable characters - specification.
[15:07:03] <shoky> every blog is not every website..
[15:07:14] <Fishbowne> a blog IS a website though.
[15:07:17] <shoky> and calling it JSON is wrong
[15:08:41] <Fishbowne> I see your point... however I think most people just throw the term around.
[15:08:45] <Fishbowne> for economy.
[15:08:54] <shoky> JS is more economic
[15:09:01] <iwantoski> Fishbowne: for confusion
[15:09:07] <Fishbowne> JSO vs. JSON i suppose would be more accurate ?
[15:09:13] <iwantoski> no
[15:09:19] <grafi> what
[15:09:21] <grafi> oô
[15:09:23] <iwantoski> JavaScript Object vs. JavaScript Object Notation
[15:09:26] <Fishbowne> one is the object, the other is the object in a notated format ?
[15:09:39] <Fishbowne> that is more or less what I just said.
[15:09:42] <shoky> JSON is a subset of javscript object syntax
[15:09:49] <shoky> {bla:5}  is not valid JSON
[15:10:12] <tw2113> {'bla':'5'} ?
[15:10:18] <shoky> not valid JSON
[15:10:22] <iwantoski> JSON is a object notation specification represented in a string format - using printable charaters, dude.
[15:10:24] <grafi> tw2113 you noob
[15:10:25] <grafi> :p
[15:10:29] <iwantoski> {"bla": 5}
[15:10:50] <tw2113> it happens
[15:11:02] <grafi> JSON.stringify({bla: 5})
[15:11:04] <grafi> im cheatign
[15:11:06] <iwantoski> ["valid": true]
[15:11:07] <grafi> <.<
[15:11:15] <iwantoski> uhm
[15:11:18] <iwantoski> stupid spellcheck
[15:11:29] <iwantoski> anyway, ["valid"]
[15:12:44] <Fishbowne> So the notation gets converted to an object when you run say...  JSONparse ...
[15:13:13] <Fishbowne> and you're saying since JSON is a subset, not ALL javascript objects can be JSON'd
[15:13:19] <shoky> yup. one might even say.. parsed into an object ;p
[15:13:41] <shoky> javascript objects can contain references to live objects in memory
[15:13:48] <shoky> JSON is just a string with text.
[15:14:12] <shoky> but yeah the last thing you said is right
[15:14:27] <shoky> er well
[15:14:44] <Fishbowne> or perhaps they can be JSON'd but since the reference is null, it would be pointless.
[15:14:46] <shoky> i just meant that {bla:5} is a valid js object but not valid json.
[15:15:08] <shoky> hmm? what reference is null?
[15:15:56] <Fishbowne> you could probablyt export the object with the object in memory reference, but it would be pointless for the most part to save the reference.
[15:16:15] <shoky> you can stringify it
[15:16:32] <Fishbowne> yes but your reference to the lIve object would be pointless (with no application)
[15:16:35] <shoky> if it doesn't have circular references
[15:16:58] <shoky> well that depends.. the live object could be a simple object that is easy to stringify and make sense of as JSON too.
[15:17:25] <Fishbowne> right but saving the reference without the object itself, would be pointless.
[15:17:34] <shoky> but if it's a reference to an html element object for example, then it doesn't make much sense to stringify
[15:17:48] <shoky> stringifying resolves references implicitly
[15:18:05] <Fishbowne> I see.
[15:18:08] <shoky> so it's not pointless in that respect
[15:18:13] <Velveeta> also, if you try to stringify an html element, you'll most likely get a circular reference error
[15:18:29] <shoky> yop
[15:18:37] <Fishbowne> why would you stringify an HTML element.
[15:18:53] <shoky> some people thing they can save the element that way ;]
[15:18:58] <shoky> think
[15:20:23] <Fishbowne> its stringify basically the same thing as serializing your object ?
[15:20:31] <Fishbowne> isnt'
[15:20:35] <Fishbowne> more or less ?
[15:20:51] <shoky> yep
[15:21:07] <shoky> serializing is a more general term
[15:21:11] <Fishbowne> and going from JSON to a JSO is deserializing ?
[15:21:16] <shoky> you can serialize to a binary file for example
[15:21:33] <shoky> mmm i suppose?
[15:28:21] <grafi> well its happened
[15:28:30] <grafi> i ran out of stuff to watch on youtube
[15:28:31] <grafi> ...

[16:30:35] <jhoffmcd> is there a way to fire off a dialog function on first page view but not on page refresh?
[16:31:20] <willisis> jhoffmcd yes. store a cookie after your fire off the dialog and check for its existence before you fire it.
[16:32:05] <jhoffmcd> willisis: Ahh thanks! I couldnt think of that for the life of me.
[16:33:20] <willisis> jhoffmcd sure
[16:37:10] <grafi> shoky you shoky you
[17:02:26] <shoky> oogabooga
[17:12:01] <HarryPitfall> Crash Bandicoot?

[17:40:23] <musty> hello.
[17:40:30] <musty> anyone here good with mailchimp integration?
[17:41:23] <musty> The API seems simple enough, I'm parsing email addresses through jquery to php, but the requests aren't being sent back in any sort of way.
[17:58:12] <guide_X> how do you prevent duplicate text from reaching a select list
[18:29:08] <Eagle5> hey guys how can i retrieve an object from php constantly
[18:29:22] <Eagle5> i know theres Ajax but can someone show an example or something?
[18:32:29] <willisis> Eagle5 what do you mean by "constantly"
[18:35:09] <Eagle5> im encoding an object every 100 ms
[18:35:21] <Eagle5> and i need ajax to pull that information
[18:36:20] <willisis> setTimeout is your friend.
[18:37:45] <willisis> or setInterval. but something like 'function getPhpObject (){ $.ajax(...blah...blah); setTimeout(getPhpObject, 100) }
[18:37:47] <willisis> should do it.
[18:38:26] <willisis> Eagle5 http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[18:39:08] <Eagle5> so in php i have an array of a lot of objects
[18:39:39] <Eagle5> do i set a timer on the json encoding too?
[18:41:18] <willisis> well, not any more often than 100ms, like you said.
[18:43:34] <Eagle5> oh ok and willisis the thing i dont understand is how ajax points to the thing im encoding
[18:43:46] <Eagle5> how does it know which function to grab the json from
[18:45:19] <willisis> you make a function in your php that is exposed at a url (or via ?url&params). it echos/outputs your object. jQuery's $.ajax method looks to that url every N seconds.
[18:46:46] <Eagle5> OH
[18:46:52] <Eagle5> so ajax calls the page that is being displayed?
[18:46:57] <Eagle5> i mean
[18:47:00] <Eagle5> the info thats being displayed
[18:47:10] <willisis> so file getObject.php my be resolved at mysite.com/getObject.php and that would have a single function that prints a JSON object.
[18:51:05] <Eagle5> willisis, thank you so much
[18:54:29] <willisis> eagle5 sure. good luck.
[19:30:25] <tablespill> how do i load an external page or a page on my domain to a div?
[19:30:52] <tablespill> or how do i make a div work like an iframe?
[19:44:13] <willisis> tablespill $('#mydiv').load('myurl.html')
[19:45:41] <tablespill> willisis: can you show me oin jsfiddle?
[19:45:48] <tablespill> i'm new to jquery/javascript
[19:45:56] <tablespill> i'm trying to get that to work without any luck
[19:56:37] <willisis> howzabout you show me what you have on jsfiddle.

[20:07:26] <RonWhoCares> Is it possible for the "close_ticket.php" to return "TRUE" (or something similar to jQuery)?  I don't want the two "empty()" to run unless the PHP executed successfully.  http://jsfiddle.net/9z2bb/
[20:12:22] <shoky> RonWhoCares:  if (data==="TRUE") { ... }
[20:14:33] <RonWhoCares> where does it go?
[20:16:02] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/9z2bb/1/
[20:17:14] <shoky> and of course.. this will only work if the response is exactly: TRUE
[20:17:44] <shoky> and a suitable content-type header
[20:20:32] <RonWhoCares> ok
[20:20:34] <RonWhoCares> I will try this
[20:23:19] <RonWhoCares> great
[20:25:01] <RonWhoCares> thank you
[20:43:01] <helloosss> hey guys, i just came across this really cool site and wondering how I can make my own like it http://www.getharvest.com/field-guides/pricing/fixed-fee/5
[20:43:12] <helloosss> i am not sure what its built on, i assume jquery and ther eis some library...

[21:23:00] <Erma> Hi all, I want to save multiple images to file system, but only last image is getting stored. I described my code here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20437923/upload-multiple-images-to-filesystem . Please help, Thanks.
[21:26:12] <jsc802> if numbers are in an array in json do they have to have quotes around them?
[21:26:21] <jsc802> that seems inneficient
[22:22:31] <Whiskey> i have a question
[22:22:51] <Whiskey> how do i make jQuery search for a file every 1s untill its found it and then stop search after it
[22:23:35] <tectonic> search?
[22:23:49] <jabohemian> weird question, does anyone know of a really short url for a latest jquery cdn that is rememberable?
[22:24:02] <Whiskey> yeh a local file
[22:24:11] <Whiskey> as it not exist it has to loop untill it does
[22:25:10] * jabohemian cant tell if Whiskey is being snarky or answering a diff question
[22:25:24] <Whiskey> you don´t get it?
[22:25:36] <jabohemian> oh
[22:26:24] <Whiskey> lets say you search for a file in root/thisfile but when script is running the file won´t be there, it will be created lets say 10s after js is loaded, then notice its there and stop loop
[22:26:45] <jabohemian> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[22:26:47] <jabohemian> found one
[22:33:50] <Whiskey> something like this, http://jsfiddle.net/uwWeb/
[23:32:58] <Mitranim> Good morning all! Yet another drowsy Saturday ~_~
[23:36:47] <Mitranim> Damn, loaded up my test page on an Android phone (a powerful one, mind you), and mobile browsers are so friggin SLOW
[23:37:06] <Mitranim> Can't handle appending 600 elements as fast as desktop does =/
[23:37:17] <Mitranim> Gotta optimise somehow
[23:37:50] <Mitranim> How can I optimise appending 600 elements if they're already loaded from server as a single block of text?
[23:38:31] <Mitranim> I mean, I get them as a JSON element, process into a JavaScript element, then append to an element via jQuery to become HTML
[23:38:52] <Mitranim> The browser then has to render them individually of course
[23:38:58] <Mitranim> How could it be optimised...
[23:39:55] <Mitranim> Come on people, don't be so snoozy
