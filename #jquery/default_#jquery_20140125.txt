[02:12:22] <garietyxxx> Does anyone know how jQuery triggers events? I can't find any use of fireEvent or dispatchEvent in the source.
[03:30:24] <Jaycob_> why doesn't assigning click events to <object>s or <embed>s work?
[03:58:13] <frank_o> Hi gang
[03:58:26] <frank_o> What's going on?
[03:58:30] <frank_o> Hi Anne_
[03:58:33] <frank_o> Hi p1wr
[03:58:37] <frank_o> :)
[05:32:10] <Jonta> Asked before, but not resolved: How can I make this script case insensitive? http://stackoverflow.com/a/19947532/36948 and demoed at http://jsfiddle.net/Zhd2X/21
[05:33:01] <Jonta> We had an idea of using .toLowerCase on line 17 or so, but that didn't work unfortunately.
[05:33:11] <Jonta> (Talking about the filter-part here)
[05:47:33] <ybl> Hi! I need some help on saving javascript form data using jquery.ajax()
[05:48:56] <ybl> I have a javascript that monitors cursor position, I need to save that data using jquery.ajax()
[05:52:43] <Tumulte> hello
[05:56:29] <Tumulte> My problem is not a problem : I'd like to understand my solution :)
[05:57:35] <Jonta> Tumulte: Don't ask to ask. Just ask.
[05:57:48] <Tumulte> I'm using jquery's address plugin that monitors address change. When in header it fires twices (i.e. : detecting an address change)
[05:57:57] <Tumulte> when in footer it's fine
[05:58:39] <Tumulte> how can I find the redirection... or whatever... that happens between <head>'s load an <body>'s load
[05:59:04] <Tumulte> I suspect my php framework, but it's server side
[06:03:46] <ericandrewlewis> if jquery finds multiple elements that match the selector, and you apply a method that gets info about one selector (e.g. .attr() ), does it apply to the first matching element?
[06:04:07] <grafi> Tumulte I neither understand the problem, nor your solution :P
[06:04:28] <grafi> ericandrewlewis should work that way
[06:04:49] <ericandrewlewis> ah "Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements"
[06:05:03] <ericandrewlewis> that's a nice convenience, although maybe a bit obfuscating
[06:05:20] <grafi> only if you dont know what you are doing ;)
[06:17:56] <ufk_> i have a json string that i need to pass to a javascript variable using php, but the json string itself contains " anad '. so how can i do that? do i need to str_replace the  ' ?
[06:18:06] <pseudonymous> Hi, I'm trying in vain to get what I perceive the be the root element of an XML document. - the Document looks like this (http://feeds2.feedburner.com/TheLinuxActionShowOGG) and I'm making a httpRequest and trying to query on httpReq.responseXML
[06:19:06] <pseudonymous> (Every other thing I can get just fine, "channel > title" yields the channel-wide title, for example.. It's just that I can't do $(httpReq.requestXML).find("rss").attributes
[06:19:20] <grafi> ufk_ escape like so \" \'
[06:19:48] <ufk_> good idea :)
[06:24:09] <ericandrewlewis> if i have a dynamically loaded <select> that i'm trying to bind a `change` event handler to
[06:24:25] <ericandrewlewis> binding via .change() on document ready will not work, since it doesn't exist
[06:24:55] <ericandrewlewis> delegate()?
[06:25:09] <grafi> .on
[06:25:26] <grafi> $(document).on('change', 'select', function() {})
[06:25:53] <grafi> where document should be a parent element that exists at time of binding and select the reail selector for your select
[06:28:20] <ericandrewlewis> sweet
[06:28:52] <ericandrewlewis> all events bubble up the dom chain even if the event doesn't apply to it, interesting
[06:29:21] <grafi> thats how that works :p
[06:36:26] <pseudonymous> rephrase: given I have the XML response in a variable, 'xmldoc' -- how can I get at the *attributes* of the document root element (in this case, the document root element is 'rss' and the attributes various XML namespaces)
[06:53:36] <pseudonymous> OK, can anyone then at least help clarify one thing for me. http://pastebin.com/KUmT7135 -- why does the first example work fine whereas the second will throw an error @ line 10 due to an undefined value ? As in: what's the difference between looping over a result set (with each) and picking the first result (with first) ?
[07:15:21] <gry> something like $.when, but does queries in succession and stops if one of them fails?
[07:22:24] <grafi> why is the succession important?
[07:23:45] <gry> grafi: i edit a wiki and run into edit conflict (need to move page first, then edit)
[07:23:53] <gry> edit wiki through ajax
[07:24:29] <grafi> hm
[07:24:51] <grafi> probably make a little queue then
[07:25:21] <shoky> gry there's https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue   tho it doesn't stop on fail i believe
[07:25:56] <grafi> should be easy enough to add though
[07:27:01] <shoky> yup, i think just changing the line  .then(next, next);   to .then(next);     might be enough
[07:27:13] <grafi> :P
[07:29:22] <zargath> hi

[07:48:29] <ShawnRisk> How do I create a flicker effect like a bad lighting where this happens for 7 seconds, with a 1 or 2 second pause for 5 times?  Code: http://pastebin.com/hMEx4Fn5 and I am using setTimeout(function(){ pulse(); }, 2000); to call the function.
[08:10:49] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[08:17:56] <decx> ShawnRisk same as yesterday. css3 keyframes http://jsfiddle.net/uLqQ6/
[08:20:41] <ShawnRisk> decx: yes but this is not doing anything in jsfiddle

[09:14:12] <BasementBilly> i have a div with a radio button in it, on div click i check the radio button, but if i click the radio it'll trigger the on div click function and they'll cancel out... halp?
[09:15:37] <decx> instead of using a div as a click-zone use a label, that automatically targets the input without any js
[09:15:57] <BasementBilly> i can just put the div inside a label?
[09:16:25] <decx> <label><input type="text">Labelname</label>
[09:16:36] <BasementBilly> oh
[09:16:44] <BasementBilly> i do that, i want the entire div to be able to be clicked
[09:16:49] <BasementBilly> i have that inside the div
[09:17:13] <decx> well you can write something for that, but it would make more sense to just make the label bigger
[09:17:20] <BasementBilly> i can just put the div inside a label?
[09:17:40] <decx> you'd have to set the div to inline or inline block
[09:17:50] <decx> as a default label is an inline element
[09:18:52] <BasementBilly> but the whole div isn't going to be clickable is it?
[09:18:57] <BasementBilly> it's a big div
[09:19:43] <decx> imho, if you want a big clickzone just make the label block bigger
[09:42:21] <xmode> can anyone help me this this issue?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21353732/jquery-cant-hide-data-that-was-dinamically-added

[09:45:35] <decx> but if you use an old version then live works as well, there might be something wrong about the rest of the function
[09:45:51] <xmode> no because itstill doesnt hide the element loaded by ajax

[10:40:25] <ShawnRisk> is there a way to rotate the clock in place on this site below the flashing logo, http://www.wadevs.com/Music
[10:52:57] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: Look at transform-origin
[10:54:25] <BillCriswell> More directly: transform-origin: center
[10:55:45] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: looking
[10:57:54] <BillCriswell> BRB
[11:09:30] <KWhat4> Hi, I am trying to get a span with a class ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-s to line up next to some text yet it seems to end up wrapped every time.  Adding white-space: nowrap; or &nbsp; has no effect.  Any ideas?
[11:09:48] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: transform-original: center didn't work out for me as the console didn't like the code.
[11:13:02] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: I didn't type that. =)
[11:15:14] <BillCriswell> transform-origin
[11:16:46] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: oops I typed this wrong but I used transform-origin in my code and didn't like that.
[11:17:18] <BillCriswell> You didn't like that?
[11:17:33] <decx> you still have to write the transform: rotate rule
[11:18:02] <decx> transform-origin is advanced usage
[11:18:31] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: this is the error: center is not defined
[11:18:51] <ShawnRisk> decx: I am using transform and transform-origin
[11:19:25] <decx> well then i take everything back
[11:19:26] <decx> ;)
[11:20:01] <decx> you haven't been that keen on css3 transformations the past few days
[11:20:17] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: You have to quote center in javascript.
[11:20:33] <BillCriswell> You can apply this straight to the CSS though since you don't need to update it every scroll.
[11:21:11] <BillCriswell> so do #clock { -webkit-transform-origin: center; } in your CSS and take the margins off the image inside it.
[11:24:26] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: thanks that worked out
[11:24:33] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[11:25:15] <decx> does chrome still have ugly edges when rotating images?
[11:26:24] <BillCriswell> I have no idea
[11:26:35] <BillCriswell> Don't use too much fun stuff at work sadly.
[11:26:52] <decx> i remember having to add preserve 3d and rotateZ or something liek that
[11:27:28] <decx> since then the client ditched the animations on hover because we finally convinced him that it's bad ux
[11:27:35] <decx> ;)
[11:28:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I only like that fancy stuff done very subtly

[11:38:49] <decx> no

[11:59:11] <Es0teric> anyone here?
[11:59:25] <vladikoff> coderego, http://blog.igeek.info/2013/using-ajax-in-laravel/
[12:01:27] <blakespot> ok
[12:01:29] <blakespot> http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/Dw6V8/2/
[12:01:45] <blakespot> Note what happens rolling onto / off of the top item of the 3, there
[12:01:55] <blakespot> open, close the flyout menu
[12:02:26] <blakespot> I need the menu to stay open - not close - if you move the mouse from the Chose option into the exposed light blue menu
[12:02:44] <blakespot> a sort of "stay open" tied to that div
[12:03:00] <blakespot> any quick ideas on this? VEry new to jQ, been trying to figure it out
[12:04:48] <Velveeta> you'd have to either make your mouseleave delay the close and have a mouseenter on the content area disable the close altogether, or else make the content area a child of the menu option itself, so that when you moused onto it, it didn't count as a mouseleave on the menu
[12:05:41] <blakespot> A child? In what regard?

[13:13:15] <jQonfused> Hi there, I'm having problem with autosave using ajax post. my code --> http://pastebin.com/7CeuqSme
[13:13:53] <jQonfused> the data didn't insert to the database table, may I know where did I did wrong in the ajax part?
[13:19:16] <jQonfused> anyone?
[13:22:07] <Flam> jQonfused userDate is a php variable
[13:22:15] <Flam> you need to echo it or whatever into the js
[13:22:22] <Flam> the JS code has no idea what it is otherwise
[13:22:29] <Flam> so youre essentially sending undefined
[13:22:36] <Flam> "$userDate"
[13:22:57] <Flam> sorry no, because of the quotes you're sending to the backend the string "$userDate"
[13:23:09] <Flam> in your php print out what you get from the ajax request to see
[13:24:07] <jQonfused> Flam: ok, I changed to echo out but still not working thou. --> http://pastebin.com/yQ3a246L
[13:24:21] <Flam> print it from the php is all i can say
[13:25:22] <krastavac> $(window).height() gives crazy values on bootstrap template, anyone has idea why?
[13:25:25] <jQonfused> which on to print? I can't get you. if print $userDate it got data inside
[13:26:46] <ajeremias> hei
[13:26:59] <ajeremias> how do i update a span with the file name... of the file i just set on an <input type=file ?
[13:31:16] <decx> it's the value of the input
[13:31:30] <decx> either split or substring or w/e
[13:34:26] <jQonfused> anyone?
[13:38:13] <vladikoff> jQonfused, if $userData prints, make sure it's a valid data object, like examples in the documentation http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#entry-examples
[13:45:16] <jQonfused> vladikoff: i change the data to --> data    : {dob: '<?php echo $userDate; ?>'},
[13:45:35] <jQonfused> but over my log.php how do I capture the $userDate?
[13:51:00] <vladikoff> jQonfused, PHP help is in ##php, you will probably need http://ca2.php.net/json_decode or something
[13:52:16] <jQonfused> ok thanks for all the example, but seriously it doesn't help at all
[13:52:43] <jQonfused> as I mention, now I'm having problem with ajax not with php
[13:53:03] <jQonfused> if solely with php, the data can insert
[13:53:30] <jQonfused> but with ajax, I couldn't get the correct method to pass the value the log.php
[13:55:11] <jQonfused> for the ajax example name: "Foo" so is it the name is the one I should get from my $_POST? I also not sure, instead of you assist me in giving me a clearer picture, I just see you asking me to refer to documentation. If I can understand the documentation, then why I need to come here and ask?
[14:00:17] <reddi> jQonfused, if you have data    : {dob: '<?php echo $userDate; ?>'}, you can get the data with $_POST['dob']
[14:02:17] <jQonfused> reddi: appreciated for your help, now I got a clearer picture of getting the value from ajax
[14:02:34] <jQonfused> rather than someone keep on sending me to the documentation
[14:05:42] <jQonfused> reddi: do you mind to assist me for this code? --> http://pastebin.com/tU8LHkBu
[14:06:11] <jQonfused> i view the source and it showing me the correct code as per what I set --> data    : {userDob: '1960-01-06'},
[14:06:50] <jQonfused> but somehow, I still couldn't get the code to insert into database, is it anywhere in the ajax script went wrong?
[14:50:54] <ShawnRisk> How do I make the logo image shrink smoothly? Site: http://www.wadevs.com/Music
[15:03:03] <Vorisi> Anybody around?
[15:03:38] <Vorisi> http://tide.savagecl.com/flip_puzzle/example.html
[15:04:01] <Vorisi> for some reason, if (tile.css("background-image").indexOf(this.options.img1) > 0) {
[15:04:03] <Vorisi> that doesn't work
[15:08:33] <vladikoff> Vorisi, your selector is failing with #puzzle_4-NaN"
[15:09:34] <Vorisi> does that cause the whole system to halt?
[15:10:03] <vladikoff> Vorisi, http://v14d.com/i/52e44447ef555.jpg
[15:10:41] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[15:10:48] <Vorisi> what was your question?
[15:11:11] <vladikoff> ShawnRisk, use css transitions?
[15:11:26] <ShawnRisk> vladikoff: oh really, again :P
[15:12:16] <ShawnRisk> vladikoff: can I pm you?
[15:12:20] <vladikoff> ShawnRisk, no
[15:12:25] <ShawnRisk> okay
[15:13:43] <Vorisi> vladikoff, that's intended behavior, to a point
[15:15:04] <vladikoff> Vorisi, try if (tile.length) {
[15:15:16] <Vorisi> I think it's actually a problem with getCoords
[15:15:23] <vladikoff> okay
[15:16:15] <Vorisi> AHA
[15:16:22] <Vorisi> missed a .split("-");
[15:44:31] <consideratio> i have writted code like: myObj.on('answerRight', $.proxy(this.answerRight, this)); <--- can i when this listener is no longer needed remove it someway?
[15:46:54] <consideratio> .off() i think! nice okay
[17:11:55] <k1p1Black> Hello guys
[17:12:22] <k1p1Black> I have a problem with flipping images during onClick events
[18:24:36] <zagaza> hey.. can someone help me figure out why the jquery adds a 'top' value to .player when you drop a player onto another one? http://danielnikolovski.com/fifa/
[18:33:49] <ShawnRisk> I am here
[18:42:38] <abailarri> HEllo. I implemented a function to print a google map with a marker depening of a two giveen coordenates that exctracts from an adress and works very well. But it prints two maps. Any suggestion please? http://jsfiddle.net/zJ5fR/1/
[18:50:58] <danheberden> abailarri unrelated, but things like $('#geolocationButton').click(function(){ clickMap(); }); are superfluous
[18:51:09] <danheberden> if you already have a function, no need to call it in a new function
[18:51:19] <danheberden> i.e., $('geolocationButton').click(clickMap);
[18:51:41] <danheberden> or using the new, recommended api: $('geolocationButton').on('click', clickMap);
[18:53:05] <abailarri> danheberden, I used the third option but the problem persists
[18:53:14] <danheberden> yeah, that's unrelated
[18:53:36] <danheberden> my wifi will drop out in like ~1 minute so can't poke into it for ya
[18:53:49] <danheberden> but i'm sure one of these other 753 people can
[18:55:34] <snover> danheberden, the eternal tease
[18:56:20] <danheberden> mmm hmm
[18:56:26] <danheberden> you got my number boi
[18:56:43] <snover> no i don’t
[18:56:46] <danheberden> wat
[18:56:48] <snover> i just checked
[19:06:26] <abailarri> danheberden, now I tried this, but the map not shows
[19:06:26] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/FfTMB/1/
[19:33:38] <abailarri> anyone can help me please? I implemented this script on my web, but the map not shows. Help please: http://jsfiddle.net/FfTMB/7/

[21:50:49] <xtianus> hiu
[21:50:50] <xtianus> hi
[21:51:00] <xtianus> this is the jquery chat room
[21:51:09] <tandroid> Indeed
[21:51:20] <xtianus> i have a concept question about jquery
[21:52:20] <xtianus> i will start with this... do people write their own jquery or do they use the remote copies and somehow implement their ow classes in the remote copy
[21:52:34] * toothrot squints
[21:52:57] <coz> Oh, honey
[21:53:59] <xtianus> i have used it but i notice the classes are those that are defined
[21:54:07] <xtianus> anyone here to help?
[21:54:39] <tandroid> You can do both.
[21:55:23] <xtianus> well how do people "know" what is in the jqueryies capabilties?
[21:55:34] <tandroid> The jquery documentation
[21:55:43] <xtianus> I see neat things done on the web but how do those peoeple find out how to do that stuff
[21:56:17] <tandroid> Just start by googling what you want to do.
[21:56:29] <tandroid> Most of the time jquery documentation will come up in the search
[21:57:12] <tandroid> Also, I recommend learning some javascript first so you can write some decent code.
[21:57:29] <xtianus> ok so say I find something i like and want to implement.. I link to this http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js and then how do i find what I need in that mash of code?
[21:58:09] <tandroid> You will never need to look at that code!
[21:58:41] <xtianus> why not/
[21:58:51] <xtianus> how do i define my classes for what i need/
[21:59:26] <xtianus> and js sheets I have found from other people I search though the code for the classes they are calling...
[21:59:32] <xtianus> it's ghetto I know.
[21:59:32] <tandroid> Say you want to hide an element. So you would google "hide element jquery" and this would come up.http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[22:00:52] <xtianus> ok i see the hide and element but how would I tweek the settings?
[22:01:29] <tandroid> You should really learn javascript. It will make all of this make much more sense
[22:02:03] <xtianus> and for example i constantly see this menu slider thing that when a user scolls up the menu catches the top and shrinks a little bit.  oh and mega menu's.
[22:03:48] <tandroid> Do you know any javascript?
[22:03:51] <xtianus> i don't mind learning both at the same time... i have been doing code academy.... to be honest java might be wriing more but it seems a little more natural to me or perhaps not skipped over as much in the learning aspect.
[22:04:02] <xtianus> i just started code academy...
[22:04:12] <xtianus> i can see how learning both helps and compliments each other
[22:04:30] <xtianus> I wouldn't learn html first and then css I would learn them both.  the need each other.
[22:04:31] <tandroid> jquery is a library built on javascript. You can't get good at jquery without javascript.
[22:05:05] <tandroid> You're asking questions that would answer themselves if you knew enough javascript.
[22:05:30] <xtianus> yea but i do cool things now with jquery. the problem with people in the java world is that they want people to be these extreme coders...
[22:05:49] <xtianus> i want to make the menu slide how I want it to slide.  or a form to go through to the other end.
[22:06:09] <xtianus> i make beauty... and if it doesn't fall in the line of beauty than it loses me
[22:07:22] <tandroid> No. you do not need to be an extreme coder. but you do need to understand what javascript is capable of and stuff like, what an object is and how they are used.
[22:08:18] <tandroid> I'm sorry, it's just not as simple as you might want it to be.
[22:10:20] <xtianus> it's not the simplicity part it is the focus on waht i need part.
[22:10:37] <tandroid> And javascript is what you need.
[22:10:40] <xtianus> like for exame say i wanted to build a megamenu for my site
[22:10:47] <xtianus> how would I get started with doing that?
[22:11:11] <tandroid> Codacademy is fine, but start with javascript.
[22:12:04] <tandroid> Or use a prebuilt megamenu plugin.
[22:26:56] <initself> does this actually set the value? if ( $("select[name='ongoing']").val('1') ) {
[22:27:03] <initself> rather than just check it?
[22:28:03] <initself> it must be setting it
[22:28:30] <tandroid> If its in an If statement, it can only be checking
[22:28:44] <tandroid> but I'm not sure that your condition is checking anything
[22:37:05] <initself> i am pretty darn sure it was setting it
[22:37:08] <initself> even in the if
[22:37:18] <tandroid> That doesn't make sense
[22:37:33] <tandroid> by the way, val() doesn't take any arguments.
[23:43:12] <hmtabc> hello there
