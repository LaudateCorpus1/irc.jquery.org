[04:17:18] <aber_> Hey, I have a question related to fullcalendar. Not sure if this is the right place for that, or if anyone here can help me with that.
[04:19:46] <aber_> I'm struggling to find where fullcalendar defines the path to the icon files it uses for the UI. Due to the way I'm running it, the server wont be able to find them at the default path.
[04:51:20] <marduk1984> Having a click function to show/hide the inputs in a form, depending on what is clicked. the issue is: the plugin seems to show all at the, so my jquery doesnt make any difference. can i wait for code to be done or what might i need to do here?
[04:59:27] <Cork> marduk1984: that sentence seams incomplete
[04:59:48] <Cork> "seams to show all at the,"
[05:01:43] <marduk1984> Having a click function to show/hide the inputs in a form, depending on what is clicked. the issue is: the plugin(wordperss) seems to show all the inputs after my jquery is run, so my jquery doesnt make any difference. can i wait for code to be done or what might i need to do here?
[05:01:59] <marduk1984> Cork thanks for the headsup. Let me know, if it still unclear what i mean
[05:02:23] <Cork> do you have the code in question?
[05:02:36] <Cork> make a jsfiddle.net with the section
[05:08:29] <marduk1984> Cork im not sure how much this will help.. https://jsfiddle.net/6rL7zf8z/ but when i click on something, specific inputs should show/hide themself. works exacly how i want it to, but something is showing all the inputs at the end. Im pretty sure it has nothing to do with the code, but with wordpress etc. saying all the inputs should be displayed in the end: http://vps-online.dk/produkt/stories2/
[05:09:32] <Cork> marduk1984: $a('.story-producttype-ul').show(); might be what causes the problem for you
[05:10:02] <marduk1984> will that display inputs as well?
[05:10:11] <Cork> i don't know the markup
[05:10:51] <Cork> and also not that .hide() won't prevent the field from getting submitted
[05:10:52] <marduk1984> ul.story-producttype-ul li input
[05:11:04] <Cork> not==note
[05:11:41] <marduk1984> i know. i just dont want to give them the option of clicking on them
[05:12:31] <marduk1984> $a('.story-producttype-ul').show(); shouldnt only have influence on .story-producttype-ul and not its children, right? li input
[05:13:34] <marduk1984> *should
[05:18:09] <marduk1984> Cork have you looked in the other link i send?
[05:18:36] <Cork> marduk1984: no, and i'm tight on time; sorry
[05:18:47] <marduk1984> okay np, thanks for your time

[06:00:16] <jsparks> hi, little question can I attach an event to an object that does not exist yet? I have a class to build an html object that has to do something when pressed how can i add an event to that object?
[06:01:32] <Tennis> I thin you can just make the onclick event and it shouldnt break if the element doesnt exist
[06:01:43] <Tennis> and will take up working when it does exist
[06:01:51] <Mark____> can i get a help here? the jquery slider goes back to the first li (refreshes itself) every second or two. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/index.php?mid=today&module_srl=114#
[06:02:01] <Mark____> what’s the problem?
[06:02:54] <jsparks> Tennis yes it breaks the thing is I need it not to break :)
[06:06:18] <jsparks> Tennis I think this might do the trick $(document).on(‘click’, ‘.btn-selector’, function(){ … });
[06:07:19] <jsparks> How can I do this with a “class” object can I attaching a click event to a JQuery object not yet added to the DOM inside a class property ?
[06:54:04] <CsSn0ob> Any good advice or suggestions how can I build this thing like a js.Video? Articles might do. How to code the play video button,CSS. Like a dummy play video button. | http://i.imgur.com/H1ZyQ5v.jpg | Url link: http://raineer24.github.io/kangi/|
[07:36:10] <cannap> position:absolute in the video frame what ever
[07:37:04] <cannap> then you can center the inner stuff if the outer element is relative
[07:49:37] <sandstrom> What stuff will break if I don't allow `unsafe-eval` via Content Security Policy (CSP) for jQuery?
[07:49:38] <sandstrom> (the ones I've found myself are eval for `loadScript` and automatic eval of script tags in various situations)
[08:06:10] <Cork> sandstrom: $.getScript, jsonp mainly
[08:06:24] <sandstrom> Cork thanks! :)
[08:06:49] <Cork> but jquery core normally works fine without eval or inline
[08:06:59] <Cork> as long as you write the code the right way
[08:07:42] <sandstrom> That's great! I coded a small getScript shim that replaced getScript with something CSP-friendly. Haven't noticed any other issues (and tried to look through the jQuery source for use of `eval`), but wanted to double-check.
[08:08:08] <Cork> look for globalEval
[08:08:15] <sandstrom> Yea, I noticed :)
[08:08:27] <Cork> but ya, jsonp and getScript is the two used
[08:08:37] <Cork> none is something you really need
[08:08:52] <Cork> just have static script files and it should work fine
[08:08:56] <sandstrom> True (I think it's also one where some of the html-append methods will eval any script tag found)
[08:09:15] <Cork> ya, but only if they include script tags
[08:09:25] <sandstrom> (which can be a big xss-issue if unsafe-eval is allowed)
[08:09:43] <Cork> well it is a big issue either if unsafe-inline is allowed
[08:10:02] <Cork> for the same reason
[08:10:08] <sandstrom> agree
[08:10:39] <Cork> though how many write there site they can't the site without unsafe-inline that one requires getting used to
[08:10:46] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[08:10:50] <Cork> no
[08:10:58] <DelphiWorld> hi guys
[08:11:13] <DelphiWorld> what should i use to interact with an api?
[08:11:22] <Cork> depends on the api
[08:11:23] <DelphiWorld> like to  send a query
[08:11:36] <DelphiWorld> cork, json
[08:11:43] <Cork> so i guess http api
[08:11:50] <DelphiWorld> cork, http://myserver.com/register?token=mytoken
[08:11:57] <Cork> is it a post or get request?
[08:12:09] <DelphiWorld> Cork: lol, no clue ;)
[08:12:23] <Cork> well then you need to find out
[08:12:34] <Cork> $.get for get calls, $.post for post calls
[08:12:51] <DelphiWorld> i see
[08:12:53] <DelphiWorld> i'll see
[08:12:54] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'get/post' }) is the long version (i prefer this one)
[08:13:11] <DelphiWorld> Cork: any doc url or something?
[08:13:17] <hellyeah> i want to disable date before spesific date in jquery ui datepicker how can i do that?  http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/37/
[08:13:25] <DelphiWorld> Cork: this app is getting mad i'm mixing up jquery with angular ;)
[08:23:10] <hellyeah> hey
[08:23:37] <hellyeah> i have two datapickers is it possible to get dates between those two dates? http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/38/
[08:25:44] <slax0r> hellyeah: https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range
[08:27:04] <hellyeah> for example you choose 01/12/2016 and 04/12/2016 i need to get 01,02,03,04
[08:27:18] <hellyeah> slax0r: can that vie me this?
[08:28:34] <hellyeah> did you get what i meant?
[08:29:03] <hellyeah> found the answe
[08:29:04] <hellyeah> r
[08:29:09] <slax0r> maybe take a look at moment.js? dunno...
[08:29:30] <hellyeah> this is what i meant http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/3/
[08:42:43] <Mark____> does anybody know where i can get this kind of loading spinner? http://codesignlab.cafe24.com/rt_main_demo
[08:49:17] <Xatenev> Mark____: thats just CSS, no?
[08:49:31] <Mark____> i believe it is.
[08:49:36] <Xatenev> the website uses an animation called spinner
[08:49:46] <Xatenev> just open up the firebug, copy all the CSS stuff
[08:49:47] <Mark____> just don’t know how i can put that thing as preloader.
[08:49:51] <Mark____> haha..
[08:50:01] <Mark____> i don’t know exactly where that is though.
[08:50:02] <IamTrying> i am in Google Chrome trying to login from : https://domain1.example.com via ajax to https://domain2.example.com. JQuery throwing this error: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE is this a BUG?
[08:50:16] <Xatenev> Mark____: just inspect the .loader and .page-loader element
[08:50:24] <IamTrying> HTTPS accessing another subdomain as HTTPS (not like http to https scenario)
[08:50:26] <Xatenev> more the .loader than the .page-loader tho
[08:51:15] <Xatenev> IamTrying: happens in FF too? or only chrome
[08:51:21] <Xatenev> IamTrying: check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28857340/err-insecure-response-handing-tips-in-javascript
[08:52:19] <IamTrying> Xatenev: just before lunch break with Opera, Google Chrome, Firefox stable and canary was working. Now not working anymore, only working with old Google Chrome version 46
[08:54:19] <IamTrying> Google is extremely annoying now a days with HTTPS. People with knowledge should really speak in the community. i am trying to access from HTTPS://mysubdomain.mydomain.com to HTTPS://my-anothersubdomain.mydomain.com. Google has problem with it!! but was not issue in version 46
[08:55:00] <Cork> IamTrying: "google" 46?
[08:55:03] <Cork> you mean chrome 46?
[08:55:33] <IamTrying> Cork: YES i have in my OSX Chrome 46, Windows 8.1 Chrome 46 and in Linux Opera 33 which is Chrome 46 there it works
[08:55:48] <Cork> ya, but not google 46 :)
[08:55:58] <IamTrying> But never works in stable and canary versions. even its same domain even its https accessing to https.
[08:56:11] <IamTrying> CORRECT - i mean Chromium 46
[08:56:14] <Cork> i don't see why it would be a problem
[08:56:28] <Cork> it sees it as cross site or what?
[08:57:35] <IamTrying> Cork: WOW!!!! what a surprise, just now it was not working, i keep trying trying now it again logged in without giving the ERROR within M47, M48, M49
[08:57:57] <IamTrying> It was not working just few minutes ago. I have done nothing and all of a certain its working now.
[08:58:15] <Cork> well... define "not working"
[08:58:32] <Mark____> um, how do i make this spinner fadeout when the page loading is done? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[08:58:50] <IamTrying> Google Chrome stable, Canary was throwing this constantly: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE which i mean by "not working" - Cork
[08:59:07] <IamTrying> I have changed nothing and now suddenly its working without showing that error.
[08:59:39] <Cork> hmm
[08:59:48] <Cork> your using a cdn or something like that?
[09:00:06] <Cork> sounds like your using a system where you have multiple nodes and one of them isn't up to date
[09:00:24] <Cork> that would give exactly this behavior
[09:01:40] <IamTrying> Cork: 1) i have a  login page, running in https://server1.test.com/index.php it submits via post method to the server https://server2.test.com 2) in this combination after Google Chrome version 46 often surprisingly that error appears: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE 3) when i use Chromium M46 i have never that problem.
[09:03:56] <Xatenev> Mark____: $(document).ready(function() { $('.page-loader').fadeOut(); });
[09:04:08] <Mark____> thanks Xatenev
[09:04:09] <Cork> you prob want .load not .ready
[09:04:20] <Cork> else it will be hidden before it is visible
[09:05:04] <Mark____> thanks.
[09:05:18] <Xatenev> Cork: how does that make sense
[09:05:24] <Xatenev> Cork: ready comes after load or not?
[09:05:38] <Cork> it comes as soon as the document is parsed
[09:05:42] <Cork> BEFORE it is rendered
[09:05:49] <Cork> or external resources is loaded
[09:05:57] <Cork> s/or/and/
[09:05:57] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> and external resources is loaded
[09:06:28] <Xatenev> a yea kay
[09:06:30] <Xatenev> ty
[09:09:12] <dan_j> Hi. Is there something jquery that can reveal a Div and then hide it 10 seconds later?
[09:09:43] <Cork> dan_j: there is though setTimeout is prob the simplest solution
[09:09:45] <dan_j> I know I can probably do it with delays and things, but what if the DIV is re-displayed towards the end of the delay. I dont want it to hide too quickly.
[09:09:54] <dan_j> Ah. Forgot that. Thanks
[09:10:27] <Cork> dan_j: also you could use css3 transition
[09:19:25] <james_woods> 1. Write "a" in second line, first textbox (Name:) - Mouse-over after pressing "tab" to move to the next textbox gives you a popover "The parameter name is already used" (expected.) 2. Enter column name "abc" in second line and press tab again - mouse-over on that box after pressing tab gives you "The parameter column name is already used" (expected), but the first popover on "a" is gone (unexpected). Why?
[09:19:31] <james_woods> https://jsfiddle.net/et45yyba/7/
[09:19:42] <james_woods> Whoops - forgot to write Hello first :)
[09:24:40] <james_woods> Strange enough, (the above is the compiled coffeescript JS - the "source" coffeescript works flawlessly) https://jsfiddle.net/et45yyba/8/
[09:25:06] <Mark____> um, Xatenev
[09:25:18] <Mark____> for some reason the spinners won’t cease
[09:25:19] <Mark____> jQuery(document).load(function() { jQuery('.page-loader').fadeOut(); });
[09:25:35] <Mark____> it just goes spinning, spinning…. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[09:25:46] <Cork> Mark____: console.log(jQuery('.page-loader').length) is?
[09:25:57] <Cork> Mark____: also is the spinner shown by js?
[09:26:05] <Mark____> no, it’s just css.
[09:26:42] <Xatenev> the jquery(document).load is shit
[09:27:12] <Cork> uh, no
[09:27:40] <Mark____> yeah im getting the console error on 122
[09:27:52] <Mark____> which has nothing to do with the problem....
[09:27:53] <Mark____> idk
[09:28:09] <shoky> should be $(window).load
[09:28:28] <Cork> cafe24.com is messing things up for me cause it has so much junk they inject in the page...
[09:28:53] <Mark____> ah thanks.
[09:29:31] <Mark____> (window).load works fine, except it won’t fadeout,
[09:29:37] <Mark____> it just happens so quickly.
[09:29:57] <Cork> Mark____: cause you most likely need to wait for something that happens later then .load
[09:29:57] <shoky> works fine for me
[09:30:07] <Mark____> ah...
[09:30:14] <Xatenev> if you want it slower you can give fadeout a duration
[09:30:18] <Xatenev> like fadeOut(400)
[09:30:22] <Mark____> sure. thanks.
[09:30:29] <Cork> that is normally a bad idea though
[09:30:39] <Cork> cause that is a static time, and if something takes longer it breaks
[09:30:50] <Cork> you need to find what you want to wait for and check for that
[09:31:02] <Xatenev> hes not waiting for anything
[09:31:16] <Xatenev> hes just giving a smooth  transition to the page
[09:31:20] <Xatenev> from the loading screen
[09:32:08] <Mark____> right..
[09:57:20] <james_woods> j /rails
[09:57:26] <james_woods>  sorry

[10:34:34] <zotherstupidguy> how to consume a REST endpoint with jQuery, i am seeking an example that shows how to write the js code and show it in an html div afterwards... help?
[10:42:40] <Limarson> Hey guys, I have a strange behaviour: If I make an $.ajax() call right before a form submit and it fails (404, 500 or something), document.formxy.submit() doesn't work anymore. Does anyone have any idea about how this could happen? I somehow cannot reproduce it in jsfiddle unfortunately :/
[10:44:26] <Limarson> zotherstupidguy: There's plenty of examples of consuming REST out there with that exact request, just check google for jquery consume REST
[11:03:34] <silverdust> How's the best way to check if x exists in an node to avoid appending. So if x exists : append : else > show()

[11:14:47] <silverdust> thanks v0lksman
[11:27:16] <zotherstupidguy> Limarson whats the best practice for consuming REST apis in web Clients, send json, javascript or text?? what to do with cross-origin?
[12:35:32] <hassoon> hi
[12:35:49] <hassoon> is there a wildcard operatoor meaning different of ?
[12:36:03] <hassoon> so i select all elements whose class is different than 'foo'
[12:36:24] <hassoon> or not equal to 'foo'
[12:38:57] <arc_> you can use not() method or :not() selector
[12:40:49] <hassoon> um
[12:57:19] <bonks> Is there a built in way to capture the event when an array's push or pop methods are called or must I implement this with my own overrides and triggers?
[14:06:08] <tb_b_> hi all, is there a way to simulate keyboard presses (like ctrl+space) with Jquery (i don't think so for security reasons)
[14:08:20] <NoiseEee> rather than do that tb_b_, why not call the function/handler that a ctrl+space would call?
[14:14:56] <tb_b_> NoiseEee: because it is a third party tool which lays in background on windows and listen for the shortcut
[14:16:19] <NoiseEee> tb_b_: you can look into http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ but in your case, i should think that it is OS software listening for that keypress (likely physically), but you can try...
[14:16:49] <NoiseEee> s/physically/at the OS level
[14:16:49] <b-ot> Correction, <NoiseEee> tb_b_: you can look into http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ but in your case, i should think that it is OS software listening for that keypress (likely at the OS level), but you can try...
[14:17:02] <NoiseEee> b-ot you son of a gun, yeehah
[14:19:12] <tb_b_> yeah, that what i was thinking, it is a OS Software which waits for keystrokes

[16:26:36] <NoiseEee> indeed weird question kryl
[16:26:51] <NoiseEee> kryl: perhaps you're after a CSS rule that adds bottom margins or padding to <p>s in a <div>
[16:28:18] <kryl> it's ok I did it thank you

[17:44:07] <huck5> I've narrowed my jQuery version down to 2.1.1. But I'm not sure how to check what version of jQM I'm using.

[18:30:25] <arc_> i am using .load() to replace the contents of a div with the contents of an html file. i tried precaching all of the possible html files it might load, but it seems to still be requesting the files each time. how can i "load" from the precached files?
[18:54:59] <ABM_Dan> Quick question, I am loading a div through ajax (ahah), at the same time I would like to load a javascript value.
[18:55:30] <ABM_Dan> But setting the variable inside of a <script> tag inside of the loaded (and injected) <div> doesn't work. Javascript doesn't seem to fire there.
[18:55:49] <ABM_Dan> Is there a way to do this without issuing an extra request to get a json string?
[20:20:58] <Audlex> has anyone came across the issue where you use slideToggle to display a sub menu etc and it expands too far then jumps back?
[20:21:07] <Audlex> the menu at question is position: fixed;
[20:21:17] <duch_kazatel> do you have a test case or anything to share?
[20:21:37] <Audlex> unfortunately not yet, just thought I would have a quick check before I carry on and get it on demo
[20:22:06] <Audlex> i have read a few SO posts that don't seem to help
[20:22:19] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you've got some CSS causing some headaches.
[20:22:27] <duch_kazatel> height calculations causing problems and whatnot.
[20:22:54] <Audlex> would it be dirty to set the height with JS to avoid it?
[20:23:20] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[20:23:42] <Audlex> good to know, i will have a play around. thanx for the info
