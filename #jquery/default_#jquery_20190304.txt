[14:43:40] <iamcenz> would it be a simple $.post()?
[18:36:42] <bmmjj> hello
[18:36:48] <bmmjj> everyone
[18:36:58] <taplar> aloha
[18:37:04] <bmmjj> need some help if
[18:37:19] <bmmjj> let me share code in pastebin
[18:39:01] <bmmjj> https://pastebin.com/1rT6yRXS i have this code
[18:39:25] <bmmjj> and what i need is if input is black to send a mess
[18:39:37] <bmmjj> blank*
[18:40:02] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[18:40:06] <taplar> which input?  and when?
[18:40:06] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[18:40:12] <robertmaxrees> lol taplar++
[18:40:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:40:52] <bmmjj> i can put my html code on to see run
[18:41:08] <taplar> i can see your html, which a lot of it is commented out
[18:41:14] <taplar> i'm just curious which ones you want to check for blanks
[18:41:24] <bmmjj> ahhh ok :)
[18:41:40] <bmmjj> <input type="text" class="form-control" name="name" placeholder="copy past your User Agent to analize">
[18:41:57] <taplar> ok, and you want to check it for blank when?
[18:42:37] <bmmjj> if i click when blak i want to send a mess
[18:42:44] <taplar> click what?
[18:42:59] <bmmjj> and since i dont get it well jquery i dont know how to do it
[18:43:16] <bmmjj> <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Analyze <span class="fa fa-arrow-right"></span></button>
[18:43:22] <taplar> so when you submit
[18:43:27] <bmmjj> yes
[18:43:34] <taplar> alright, so you have a submit handler, yes?
[18:43:36] <bmmjj> sorry for my bad english :)
[18:43:44] <taplar> it's all good
[18:43:49] <bmmjj> yes
[18:44:02] <taplar> ok, so your check to see if it is blank can go in there
[18:44:17] <taplar> so logically, just thinking about it, how would you check to see if that field is blank?
[18:44:18] <bmmjj> and if the input name is blank to add a new css and info
[18:44:52] <bmmjj> if var == ''
[18:45:04] <taplar> which var?
[18:45:13] <bmmjj> but i dont get it well jquery
[18:45:15] <taplar> there is no var.  you're starting from a blank script
[18:45:28] <taplar> so step one.  how do you get the thing you need to check against?
[18:46:31] <bmmjj> i inser in this case a UserAgent then my php code display info
[18:46:44] <taplar> i mean more simply
[18:46:58] <taplar> there's an input on the page.  you want to check it to see if it's blank.  to do that, you have to get it first
[18:47:01] <taplar> how do you get it?
[18:47:04] <bmmjj> but is in html and jquery i dont chek nuthing
[18:47:32] <bmmjj> from jquery
[18:47:37] <taplar> how did you get the form to bind a submit handler on it?
[18:48:00] <bmmjj> i again i dont realy know i dont understan jquery
[18:48:12] <bmmjj> i found this code and use it
[18:48:21] <taplar> in that case i need to give you a reference, :)
[18:48:41] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[18:49:05] <bmmjj> i dont remember source :)
[18:49:11] <bmmjj> sorry
[18:49:11] <taplar> i would highly encourage you to read up some on the basics.  it will go a long way towards your understanding of the library.
[18:49:25] <bmmjj> gonna ready
[18:49:48] <taplar> k.  give it a bit and see what you can find on your own.  if you still have questions, feel free to ask again.
[18:50:34] <bmmjj> ohh ok :( thxx for your time too :)
[18:51:48] <taplar> np.  again, don't be worried about asking questions.  but there is a lot of good information on that site
[18:52:20] <taplar> teach a man to fish, and all
[18:52:50] <bmmjj> yeah i know but i never toke time to learn jquery i use it but just the basic and most od it i see on the web i copy for me
[18:53:06] <bmmjj> <taplar> teach a man to fish, and all hahaha
[18:53:11] <taplar> that can work, until it breaks, :)
[18:53:43] <bmmjj> in deed i get it what you mean i do php
[18:54:37] <bmmjj> but one question taplar
[18:54:42] <taplar> sure
[18:54:45] <bmmjj> i have a var
[18:54:54] <bmmjj> its called data
[18:55:13] <taplar> the response from the ajax call, sure
[18:55:20] <bmmjj>   $.post('post_receiver.php', $(this).serialize(), function(data){             $('#response').html(data);
[18:55:45] <bmmjj> and how can i add an extra code just to validate de data var ?
[18:56:15] <taplar> your original question was about how to check if the input field is blank.  what you're asking now is something entirely different
[18:56:21] <bmmjj> and if is blank data then i add de css,...
[18:56:40] <bmmjj> ohh sorry
[18:56:50] <bmmjj> what i mean is the data var
[18:56:58] <taplar> so not the input?
[18:57:28] <bmmjj> if i submuit  with some will display my info
[18:58:01] <bmmjj> but if black  will display my php  with info all blank
[18:58:26] <taplar> is it always going to respond with blank if the input is blank?
[18:58:45] <bmmjj> and my gold is if data if black  insted of $('#response').html(data); add css and dummy text
[18:58:54] <bmmjj> no
[18:59:04] <bmmjj> let me put it in my site
[18:59:11] <taplar> ok, so data is a string in this case.  you can trim it and compare it to an empty string
[18:59:35] <bmmjj> in php or in jquery ?
[19:00:00] <taplar> in your javascript that is setting the data on the response
[19:00:31] <bmmjj> ok
[19:00:31] <taplar> lin 56
[19:01:12] <taplar> so you can make an if statement.  if the data trimmed is not an empty string, do something, else, do something else
[19:01:27] <bmmjj> if ( data == '' ) { do some } else { $('#response').html(data); }  ?
[19:01:41] <taplar> you'll want to trim, but yes
[19:02:04] <bmmjj> ok need to check the trim function in jquery :)
[19:02:08] <taplar> also, depending upon if it is more common that you should have data vs not, you might want to swap the order, but that's more of an optimizing thing
[19:02:14] <taplar> not jQuery, javascript
[19:02:20] <taplar> and it's just data.trim()
[19:02:39] <taplar> it's one of the inherient methods off of strings in javascript
[19:02:47] <bmmjj> ok
[19:02:56] <bmmjj> give me a sencond :)
[19:03:22] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim for a reference
[19:03:57] <bmmjj> thxx
[19:07:47] <bmmjj> i put this peace of code and nuthing happens alert ( data.trim() ) ;
[19:08:02] <taplar> can you update your pastebin?
[19:08:07] <bmmjj> yes
[19:08:23] <bmmjj> and share link in my site
[19:09:30] <bmmjj> ahh wait
[19:09:34] <taplar> :)
[19:09:51] <bmmjj> some happen cache problem
[19:10:07] <bmmjj> http://www.slalom.esy.es/demo/?index=demo
[19:10:24] <bmmjj> but its never empty
[19:10:48] <bmmjj> the data var gets info from php
[19:10:50] <taplar> can you please put it in a pastebin or jsfiddle?  it's easier to read like that
[19:10:57] <bmmjj> okk
[19:11:07] <bmmjj> the php code too ?
[19:11:17] <taplar> just the javascript
[19:11:24] <bmmjj> ok
[19:12:15] <bmmjj> https://pastebin.com/1rT6yRXS
[19:12:32] <taplar> ok, and what did it alert?
[19:12:51] <bmmjj> array output of php
[19:13:04] <taplar> ?
[19:13:17] <bmmjj> you can see running in my site
[19:13:29] <bmmjj> http://www.slalom.esy.es/demo/?index=demo
[19:13:50] <taplar> or you could tell me
[19:14:13] <bmmjj> prints an alert with the array of my php code
[19:14:36] <bmmjj> with blank fields
[19:14:44] <taplar> "an array of php code" doesn't make sense for a response
[19:15:10] <bmmjj> again i dont get it jquery
[19:15:24] <taplar> copy and paste an example response
[19:15:26] <bmmjj> and when i found this code it did what i need it :)
[19:15:48] <taplar> you can either change the alert to a console.log and get it from the console, or grab it off the request in the network console
[19:16:07] <bmmjj> because if i put and user agent it prints all my info in thml
[19:16:29] <bmmjj> give me a minute
[19:18:46] <bmmjj> gonna put in pastbin
[19:18:50] <taplar> k
[19:19:52] <bmmjj> https://pastebin.com/1rT6yRXS
[19:20:05] <bmmjj> at the end of html code
[19:20:50] <taplar> that's the same link as before
[19:20:58] <taplar> with the entire page
[19:21:31] <bmmjj> sorry updated now
[19:21:39] <bmmjj> https://pastebin.com/1rT6yRXS
[19:22:02] <taplar> ok, so that's what alerted before?
[19:22:14] <bmmjj> yes
[19:22:25] <taplar> ok, yeah, that's not going to work, :)
[19:22:41] <taplar> so here's what I would suggest
[19:22:50] <bmmjj> please :)
[19:23:06] <taplar> changing your php script to return a json_encode'ed array
[19:23:37] <taplar> array( message => 'the message', data => allTheDataYouAreCurrentlyReturning )
[19:24:40] <bmmjj> i can share the php
[19:24:44] <bmmjj> but wait
[19:24:47] <taplar> If you have your php json_encode that, your $.post call will get a response like....
[19:25:02] <taplar> {"message":"something","data":"your data you showed me"}
[19:26:04] <bmmjj> in php i just have this beside my class -
[19:26:06] <bmmjj>     $HTTP_USER_AGENT = $_POST[name] ;     # $HTTP_USER_AGENT =  $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ;
[19:27:01] <bmmjj> and pre and with my class
[19:27:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hadz04jL/
[19:28:27] <bmmjj> gonna check
[19:28:56] <taplar> i'm fixing to step out for the night.  if you have more questions there should be others hanging around that can help, :)
[19:30:16] <bmmjj> yes yes thnkyou so much teplar
[19:30:33] <taplar> np man.  have a good (insert your time of day)
[19:30:57] <bmmjj> :)
[19:31:00] <bmmjj> i will
