[00:18:13] <daylum> alright seems like i'm not storing my options anywhere and thats why options from the first call of the plugin aren't there any more on the second. where would i store my settings object?
[00:18:34] <daylum> using .data on my $?
[00:23:42] <daylum> oh. cool. works. tyvm #jquery! :D
[00:24:41] <daylum> just one more question: is it orthodox and wise to do so? storing the options of a plugin using $(this).data?
[00:33:28] <Omar-> morning!
[00:35:14] <victor_> Morning Omar-
[00:35:20] <Omar-> hi victor_
[00:35:37] <daylum> omar sharif
[00:35:58] <daylum> victor cruz
[00:36:43] <Omar-> daylum haha
[00:38:18] <daylum> my jq works yay
[00:38:45] <Omar-> daylum well done ;)
[00:38:52] <daylum> what was that song where that guy sung about wearing a flower in ones hair when going to s/f?
[00:38:54] <Omar-> who needs help in jQM
[00:38:56] <Omar-> ?
[00:39:11] <daylum> oh i would, if i was at work atm.
[00:39:24] <daylum> but i'm not, so i'm keeping away from it (hate jqm).
[00:39:41] <Omar-> jqm is fun
[00:39:49] <Omar-> just need to understand it
[00:40:02] <daylum> yeah, certainly.
[00:40:14] <daylum> i am the problem. i just can't wrap my head around it.
[00:40:21] <daylum> hardly that is
[00:41:45] <Omar-> maybe because of the huge changes in 1.4
[00:42:07] <Omar-> however, 1.4 fixed many bugs in previous releases
[00:43:11] <daylum> exactly that
[00:43:13] <daylum> both
[00:43:24] <daylum> anyway things keep getting better :3
[00:44:26] <stompdaroach> jqm as jquery mobile?
[00:45:56] <Omar-> stompdaroach yeah
[00:46:24] <Omar-> daylum the next release (1.5) jqm and jq-ui are going to be merged
[00:46:37] <Omar-> because both overlap in many areas/widgets
[00:46:39] <daylum> rly
[00:46:43] <Omar-> yup
[00:46:55] <daylum> i hope the ui from jqm is being merged into jqui
[00:47:08] <Omar-> they will be merged
[00:47:41] <Omar-> but i dont know how long it would take
[00:48:12] <daylum> yeah but one style sheet will have to have preference - and i think jqm's css is far more contemporary than jqui's
[00:48:32] <daylum> especially since buttons arent rounded any more :3
[00:55:05] <Omar-> daylum yea, you need to override default border-raduis of buttons
[00:55:41] <Omar-> the big issue for me and other developers that pagecontainer events cant be delegated to specific pages anymore
[00:57:07] <daylum> how do devs justify that?
[01:01:56] <Omar-> daylum i dont know
[01:02:25] <Omar-> daylum http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/

[01:10:15] * Omar- has no idea
[01:25:33] <abailarri> Hello. I have an script to upload images to a post when it is creating. I want to delete the image if the post is not saved, but I don't know how to detect if the post is not saved for delete the image. Any suggestions?
[01:43:49] <daylum> does a button with data-rel="cancel" have any functionality ootb?
[01:44:17] <daylum> because
[01:44:49] <daylum> it does what i want it to do, but without adding the code.
[01:50:17] <Omar-> daylum no, there's no data-role cancel
[01:50:27] <Omar-> in a popup use data-role="back"
[01:50:30] <Omar-> sorry
[01:50:32] <Omar-> data-rel
[01:50:48] <Omar-> also in a dialog
[02:17:55] <kenman> hi
[02:19:01] <kenman> anybody can help me?????
[02:43:02] <Mement> I have a 'div content' that contains 6 'div item'. I like to hide all 'div item' that comes after the first 3 'div item'. I know how to do this when the div have different name, but is it possible when the items have the same class name?
[02:44:37] <slax0r> .each
[02:44:55] <slax0r> or .slice
[02:45:16] <Mement> Ah, cheers!
[03:16:45] <Omar-> Mement you can do $(div.class).eq(3).nextAll().addBack().hide()
[03:20:02] <Omar-> Mement http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cq6w4qao/
[03:45:20] <daylum> .on('click') or .click() ?
[03:45:24] <daylum> which one is deprecated?
[03:47:37] <Kartagis> non
[03:47:51] <Kartagis> one is shortcut of the other
[03:48:19] <daylum> ty
[03:50:11] <Omar-> I prefer using .on()
[03:54:12] <daylum> ya me too, and know as i know click is just overhead i will stick to it.
[03:54:58] <Omar-> yup
[03:56:20] <victor_> Mement: Does this help? http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[03:57:51] <Omar-> victor_ nice, never heard of it
[03:58:20] <Uhkis> that looks like something i could've used multiple times
[04:06:25] <root3d> which jquery range slide is best for customization ?
[04:14:03] <lippoliv> after "off" my swipeleft callback and "on" it again, it won't be called anymore on android :/ any ideas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27859870/android-jquery-second-on-swipeleft-wont-execute
[04:15:27] <Omar-> lippoliv
[04:15:38] <Omar-> you're removing swipes on touchstart
[04:16:17] <lippoliv> just if two fingers are touched. And then I re-on my callback on touchend
[04:17:05] <lippoliv> first time my callback is working. then i touch with two fingers, release and then it is not working anymore, but "initSwipe" is called again, so the callbacks where re-set ...
[04:18:51] <Omar-> lippoliv instead of .off() swipes, try return false; if two fingers touched
[04:19:47] <lippoliv> that is the original problem: then on android (as long as an swipeleft or swiperight is registered) the zoom will be canceled after fingers moved 30px ://
[04:20:01] <lippoliv> tooked me hours to figure that out...
[04:20:33] <Omar-> lippoliv http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/p7z3ov1u/
[04:21:11] <Omar-> I added a condition in "if statement" of next/prev functions
[04:21:28] <Omar-> and remove removeSwipe(); in touchstart
[04:21:33] <Omar-> try it
[04:22:02] <lippoliv> can you pastebin?
[04:22:21] <lippoliv> i think i tryed it allready, but possible i missunderstand your idea xD
[04:22:25] <Omar-> just copy the code in http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/p7z3ov1u/
[04:22:32] <Omar-> it's like pastebin ;)
[04:22:42] <lippoliv> uhm... didn't saw that link xD
[04:22:49] <Kartagis> but much much better
[04:22:54] <Kartagis> ad-free
[04:23:08] <Omar-> Kartagis +1
[04:23:18] <Kartagis> you can run html, css and javascript
[04:23:26] <Kartagis> jsfiddle++
[04:23:48] <Kartagis> also jquery and jquery.ui
[04:24:02] <Kartagis> with different jquery versions
[04:24:12] <lippoliv> Omar-: as i told you: now android kills the two-finger zoom after 30px
[04:24:43] <lippoliv> hey guys, I know jsfiddle.net trust me. I don't code the first time :) :)
[04:26:16] <Omar-> lippoliv so the code didn't work?
[04:26:23] <Omar-> i meant the changes
[04:26:54] <lippoliv> it work, but it produces the original problem why i do the whole "de-register" and "re-register" shit stuff o.O
[04:26:54] <Omar-> because swipe is triggered after 30px swiping
[04:27:13] <lippoliv> jepp, even if the function does nothing.
[04:27:20] <Omar-> lippoliv only happens in android?
[04:27:21] <lippoliv> it kills the two-finger-zoom
[04:27:24] <lippoliv> jepp
[04:27:33] <lippoliv> ios and even windows phone work perfect
[04:27:46] <Omar-> so it's an android issue
[04:27:52] <lippoliv> but my goal is ios + android (even if i like windows phone)
[04:28:27] <lippoliv> Omar-: what I tried to do in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27859870/android-jquery-second-on-swipeleft-wont-execute is not that bad... why does it not work?
[04:28:43] <lippoliv> I search someone who can tell me what is so wrong on that idea ^^
[04:29:06] <Mement> victor_: Was on a break. Thanks for the response, .slice() did the trick however. I was pointed to that function a lil earlier in this chat. :)
[04:29:10] <Omar-> lippoliv try overriding swipe horizontal distance when you disable swipping
[04:29:12] <Omar-> http://stackoverflow.com/a/16523579
[04:29:42] <lippoliv> Omar-: nice idea :) will give it a try
[04:29:51] <Omar-> lippoliv I saw your question, but I no longer want to contribute to SE network
[04:30:06] <Omar-> lippoliv i hope it works :)
[04:30:16] <Mement> Omar-: Thanks for your response aswell with the JSFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cq6w4qao/), also good solution
[04:30:29] <Omar-> Mement you're welcome :)
[04:34:47] <Omar-> Mement you can also replace .eq(3) with .eq(2) and remove .addBack()
[04:36:20] <lippoliv> Omar-: doesn't work, may becaouse outside of "mobileinit"... "[...]This must be done during the mobileinit event, like this:[...]"
[04:36:33] <Omar-> no, you dont't need it
[04:36:39] <Omar-> I'll update your code
[04:36:55] <HGtronic> Hi ppl http://laravel.io/bin/aNvLB autocomplete wont work why?
[04:38:40] <Omar-> lippoliv http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/p7z3ov1u/2/
[04:38:45] <lippoliv> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/p7z3ov1u/1/
[04:39:16] <Omar-> exactly lippoliv
[04:39:21] <lippoliv> doesn't work :/
[04:40:21] <Omar-> lippoliv in my fiddle I also applied the previous changes
[04:40:28] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/p7z3ov1u/2/
[04:40:37] <Cr0vaX> hi there, I want the teste DIV to get the value of both NUMBER and YEAR, after change NUMBER or YEAR inputs, can you help me? http://jsfiddle.net/pt1ccqLk/4/
[04:41:32] <lippoliv> saw that, but that souldn't have an effect because the callback must not be executed because than it will produce the "cancle zoom" issue on android :/
[04:42:31] <Omar-> Cr0vaX it works, what do you exactly need?
[04:42:37] <Omar-> lippoliv this is weird
[04:42:56] <Cork> Cr0vaX: you would have to query for both fields in the validaRequiscao function instead of in the change event
[04:43:10] <Cork> as you can't know the value of the other field if you don't have it
[04:43:11] <HGtronic> http://laravel.io/bin/aNvLB need help
[04:43:20] <Cork> ?ask @ HGtronic
[04:43:20] <b-ot> HGtronic: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:43:33] <Cr0vaX> Omar-: if I change YEAR or NUMBER inputs, I want to get in the DIV a formatted string with YEAR/NUMBER, instead of just YEAR or NUMBER
[04:43:53] <lippoliv> Cr0vaX: http://jsfiddle.net/pt1ccqLk/5/
[04:44:07] <HGtronic> Im trying to make autocomplete work when entering a recipient username
[04:44:12] <HGtronic> http://laravel.io/bin/aNvLB i dont this so far
[04:44:20] <HGtronic> but nothing happens its a js error
[04:44:24] <lippoliv> I gave an ID to the both inputs, then on the change events I load the val of the other input
[04:44:34] <HGtronic> when i set a term manualy i see the response
[04:44:48] <Cr0vaX> Omar-:loppoliv did it :) ty
[04:44:52] <Cr0vaX> ty lippoliv
[04:44:59] <anli> There should be a .click handler but where clicking inside children is excluded
[04:45:15] <Omar-> Cr0vaX http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/pt1ccqLk/6/
[04:45:27] <lippoliv> Cr0vaX: take care of don't use the ID twice per HTML, thats invalid
[04:45:59] <Cr0vaX> that's another problem I'll have
[04:46:05] <lippoliv> may you can save the values, so you don't have to search the controlls everytime ^^
[04:46:35] <Omar-> lippoliv which browser are you using on android?
[04:46:46] <lippoliv> Omar-: the original
[04:46:57] <lippoliv> as the most of the targeted member-group -.-
[04:47:04] <Cr0vaX> because I'll be adding fields dynamically, and using it as an array
[04:47:16] <Omar-> what do they call it? lol
[04:47:25] <Omar-> i;m not an android user
[04:47:31] <Cr0vaX> but I'll try to fix it anyway :)
[04:47:33] <Cr0vaX> ty
[04:47:39] <lippoliv> haha... the app is named "browser" xD
[04:47:48] <Omar-> lol
[04:47:55] <Omar-> webviewer? something like this?
[04:48:49] <ewz> This is a JSON question: I have a $.get() command that returns a list of dates: "2015-01-05","2015-01-15". They are stored in the response variable. How do I get the dates? I want to say something like console.log(response[1]); and have it print "2015-01-15"
[04:49:03] <lippoliv> Just "browser" even "app-info" display that name... should be an chrome, because it is android, or?
[04:49:40] <Cork> ewz: you stipped out too much of the json
[04:49:43] <Omar-> lippoliv maybe, I dont know
[04:49:51] <Cork> is it ["","",""] or what?
[04:49:55] <Cork> is there a key for the array?
[04:49:59] <Cork> and so on
[04:50:16] <Omar-> I'm looking up touchstart event object properties in android native browser
[04:50:20] <HGtronic> http://laravel.io/bin/aNvLB#8 autocomplete wont work can someone help?
[04:50:39] <ewz> Cork I tried many ways including {"list":["2015-01-05","2015-01-15"]}
[04:51:00] <ewz> then I tried response.list[1]
[04:51:02] <Cork> ewz: also is the server sending json or just text in a text/html document?
[04:51:14] <Cork> (meaning is the server setting the correct content-type headr)
[04:51:20] <ewz> text, I mean I have it formatted as JSON
[04:51:29] <Cork> ok there is your problem then
[04:51:41] <Cork> config the server to send Content-Type: application/json
[04:51:45] <Cork> and things should work
[04:52:06] <Cork> ewz: note that is a header not content
[04:52:16] <lippoliv> Omar-: ?
[04:52:41] <ewz> yeah, how do i do that? is tere any way to say response.JSON or something
[04:53:07] <ewz> or is there a variable I can put in the get?
[04:53:16] <Cork> depends on how you serve the content server side
[04:53:37] <Cork> if it is a file then it is the web server that needs to know about the file type
[04:53:42] <Cork> if it is generated in a language
[04:53:48] <Cork> the language needs to set the header first
[04:54:19] <ewz> so there's no way to tell javascript to treat a string as JSON?
[04:54:39] <Cork> you can hack around the broken server
[04:54:43] <Kev-> You can tell .ajax objects what data type to expect
[04:54:44] <Cork> but why not fix the problem instead?
[04:55:25] <Cork> Kev-: if you think about dataType it is what type to ASK for not what it will get
[04:55:39] <Kev-> dataType
[04:55:39] <Kev-> Type: String
[04:55:39] <Kev-> The type of data expected from the server. Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html).
[04:55:46] <Kev-> Not what to ask for.
[04:55:51] <Kev-> What to treat the response as.
[04:55:53] <Cork> ya dataType sets the Accept header
[04:55:54] <Cork> no
[04:55:59] <ewz> It's not something I have access to
[04:56:27] <Cork> ewz: ok check the response in the browser and check what the content-type is
[04:56:46] <Cork> i just assumed you had created it your self, it sounded like that
[04:57:37] <ewz> GOT IT: JSON.parse(response);
[04:58:22] <ewz> so var t = JSON.parse(response); t.list[1];
[04:58:39] <ewz> Thanks for the help!
[05:01:13] <R13ose> hi

[05:13:22] <lippoliv> Omar-: I got it
[05:13:30] <lippoliv> Its an bug in jqueryui
[05:14:35] <R13ose> On this site: http://ecosanity.org I want to make the thumbnails that popup when you hover the background images to be clickable and go to another page.  How do I do that?
[05:14:41] <lippoliv> *jquierymobile
[05:15:22] <lippoliv> Omar-: look here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js#L268
[05:15:52] <lippoliv> they to event.preventDefault(), if I comment out that line and use my customized jquerymobile, andoird works like a charm

[05:21:43] <lippoliv> Omar-: HAHA looks quiet familiar, doesn't it: http://pastebin.com/vLvSepFN
[05:22:15] <lippoliv> its like your Idea, overwriting standard values, but you suggested the wrong values... look row 11
[05:26:25] <lippoliv> I updated my stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27859870/android-jquery-second-on-swipeleft-wont-execute/27861632#27861632

[05:31:03] <dang`r`us> hey there
[05:31:11] <R13ose> dang`r`us: hi
[05:31:12] <dang`r`us> sorry for being slightly offtopic, but is there a channel for jquery mobile?
[05:31:16] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[05:31:49] <dang`r`us> I haven't seen it, if you meant me
[05:31:52] <Cork> dang`r`us: this is the channel for jqm
[05:31:56] <dang`r`us> Cork, great
[05:35:09] <dang`r`us> so ... I can't seem to open a popup on pagecreate. It works fine when I open it via my browser's JS console (safari 8.0.2 on OSX 10.10.1), but when I use the exact same code on pagecreate, the popup just shows for a fraction of a second and then goes away. I'm doing this: $(document).on("pagecreate", function() { $("#cold-welcome").popup("open"); });    ... full html here:
[05:35:11] <dang`r`us> http://anatol.versteht.es/tmp/test3.html
[05:36:11] <dang`r`us> Also, do I have to use data-role or data-jqm-role? jquery mobile docs use both
[05:42:30] <Omar-> lippoliv you're welcome :) I'll upvote both your Q and A later ;)
[05:42:49] <Omar-> lippoliv if you need further assistance, you can find me here.
[06:03:52] <Raydiation> when using $.get id like to chain it like $.get(url).done(success).done(afterSuccess). how do i do this?
[06:04:00] <Raydiation> basically return a promise :P
[06:06:12] <ewz> Can someone take a look at my code, can't get days to highlight in datepicker: http://jsfiddle.net/4ove5f83/
[06:07:12] <R13ose> hi ewz
[06:07:20] <ewz> sup man
[06:07:30] <ewz> hows it going with the images?
[06:08:47] <R13ose> ewz: well still one jquery problem, want to help?
[06:09:12] <ewz> yeah, I can help for a lil, gotta get this datepicker working tho
[06:09:15] <R13ose> ewz: the dates seem highlighted to me
[06:09:22] <R13ose> days*
[06:10:16] <ewz> It looks like the 9th is highlighted because it's the current day, but the 15th isn't
[06:10:53] <R13ose> ewz: 15th is highlighted in yellow for me
[06:10:59] <R13ose> ewz: which browser?
[06:11:08] <ewz> I'm in Firefox
[06:11:09] <R13ose> ewz: On this site: http://ecosanity.org I want to make the thumbnails that popup when you hover the background images to be clickable and go to another page.  How do I do that?
[06:11:46] <R13ose> ewz: everything working in chrome and firefox for me in your jsfiddle.
[06:12:05] <ewz> wtf
[06:12:47] <ewz> how? when I inspect the td of the 15th I don't see that class there
[06:13:41] <R13ose> ewz: it is there for me.
[06:14:31] <ewz> I don't see it
[06:14:53] <ewz> can you press update on yours and send me the link?
[06:16:08] <R13ose> ewz: update what, there is nothing to update.  Can you do a clear cache refresh?
[06:16:40] <ewz> at the top of jsfiddle there is an update button
[06:18:25] <ewz> refreshed cache, still not seeing the class on either day
[06:19:28] <ewz> Oh, now I see why you're not seeing my issue, I didn't realize you had to update forks: http://jsfiddle.net/4ove5f83/1/
[06:22:19] <R13ose> ewz: let me look.  Can you look at my problem?
[06:23:18] <ewz> yeah
[06:25:32] <ewz> R13ose isolate the code you're using and create a fiddle. I find doing that alone often solves my problem
[06:25:59] <ewz> but when you have a fiddle it'll be easy to figure out why its not working
[06:26:10] <florian3> Hello everybody! is someone know how to redefine the shape of clickable area (thansk to Jquery or simply js) ?
[06:26:19] <R13ose> ewz: right but all my code is in slideshow.js so this is easy to read.
[06:27:06] <ewz> It's not easy tho. who knows what else is affecting it? So simplify your code and make a fiddle
[06:27:46] <R13ose> ewz: might be cycle.cyle(index);
[06:29:16] <ewz> just copy and paste your code (from firebug) into fiddle, and get it to the point its at now. It will be much easier to see your problem. It'll be much easier for you to see your problem
[06:30:50] <R13ose> ewz: okay I might do that.  As for your problem, what is the output of $.inArray(cal_day.getDate(),t.UnavailableDays)?
[06:40:15] <lsfc1914> Hello. I want to check all radio buttons which id contains a certain string. Can you help me to do this?
[06:40:29] <Cork> lsfc1914: add a class to the buttons
[06:40:36] <Cork> never ever select for parts on an id
[06:44:17] <lsfc1914> OK, but if I have classes name1, town1, region1, name2, town2, region2, etc. how to match those which contain "1"?
[06:44:28] <Cr0vaX> hi there, http://jsfiddle.net/pt1ccqLk/9/, when I fill year field, I want to get corresponding number field and vice versa, and print it in #TEST div, I'm unable to get it using .closest('row').find('numero').val(), can you help me?
[06:44:33] <Cork> lsfc1914: you don't
[06:44:43] <Cork> you shouldn't have the numbers in the classes
[06:45:01] <Cork> if you want unique use an id, if you want to group use class
[06:45:07] <Cork> if you need both ... use both
[06:45:30] <Cork> there is nothing wrong with <input id="name1" class="name">
[06:46:34] <Cr0vaX> the URL is http://jsfiddle.net/pt1ccqLk/9/ the other had a ',' char that didn't go to URL properly
[06:46:38] <florian3>  is someone know how to redefine the shape of clickable area ?
[06:46:38] <Cork> Cr0vaX: you use . for classes
[06:46:54] <Cork> closest('row') would look for a <row> element
[06:46:58] <florian3> with using js or jquery
[06:47:12] <Cr0vaX> oh! I see :) ty
[06:47:14] <Cork> florian3: you can't
[06:47:32] <Cork> the clickable area is the area of the element
[06:47:43] <Cork> you can round and rotate the element, but not the click area
[06:49:09] <florian3> hmmm
[06:49:27] <Cr0vaX> Cork: now it works :) ty very much :D
[06:50:01] <R13ose> Cork: any thoughts on my problem?
[06:50:28] <florian3> when we code in the html its possible with using <map><area shape></map>
[06:50:48] <Cork> well that is a heatmap
[06:50:50] <florian3> but when i create from the js the code is ok but does not work
[06:50:53] <Cork> and it is for <img> tags
[06:51:05] <Cork> and ya, it is special and VERY old
[06:51:39] <Cork> florian3: if you need to create shapes you should have a look at svg or canvas
[06:51:51] <Cork> they are meant for that
[06:51:59] <Cork> and yes you can run js in svg
[06:52:51] <rook_flood> is it possible to trigger an event bound via jQuery (e.g. `$('div').on('mousedown', function(){})`) with methods available natively to the DOM?
[06:53:01] <Cork> ?api trigger
[06:53:02] <b-ot> Cork: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[06:53:03] <ewz> I can't get two dates to compare correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/4ove5f83/6/
[06:53:16] <florian3> yes i want to avoid the svg
[06:53:23] <florian3> but canvas i can test
[06:53:50] <Cork> ewz: you arn't compareing dates the string but full dates
[06:54:15] <Cork> ewz: what you create there will still have the current hour minute and second
[06:54:20] <florian3> Cork: thank you!
[06:54:44] <Cork> florian3: with canvas you will have to do the mouse tracking manually
[06:54:52] <Cork> you basically gets no help from the browser
[06:54:52] <ewz> Ok, so I need to convert them to strings first?
[06:55:04] <Cork> you need to make sure they use the same time
[06:55:16] <R13ose> ewz: they are all highlighted now.
[06:55:23] <Cork> also make sure the date parser actually parses your date correctly
[06:55:35] <Cork> as... you can't count on Date when it comes to parsing
[06:57:57] <ewz> OK, so I need to get them both to "MM/dd/YYYY" format.
[06:58:03] <ewz> then they will compare
[06:58:07] <Cork> no
[06:58:14] <ewz> ok
[06:58:20] <Cork> you need to make sure <variable>.getFullYear() is correct
[06:58:28] <Cork> and same for the other parsed variables
[06:58:37] <Cork> you can't count on date to handle strings correctly
[06:58:42] <Cork> it MIGHT but you have to make sure
[06:58:57] <Cork> (you are using one of the messed up us date formats so you might be in luck)
[07:01:43] <R13ose> Cork: messed up us date formats?
[07:02:01] <Cork> day mm/dd/yy(yy)
[07:02:13] <Cork> at least i guess it is from the 15 at the middle
[07:02:21] <Cork> i H-A-T-E that date format
[07:02:28] <R13ose> Me too
[07:02:32] <R13ose> BillCriswell: hi
[07:02:47] <BillCriswell> Howdy
[07:02:56] <R13ose> BillCriswell: can I pm you?
[07:03:11] <BillCriswell> Cork: I never realized how much I hated it till I was a programmer lol.
[07:03:38] <Cork> BillCriswell: i hate it every time i need to read a date that could be that format
[07:03:47] <Cork> like my creditcards expiration date
[07:03:52] <R13ose> I know
[07:03:54] <BillCriswell> R13ose: If it's not a question you can ask openly I probably have the time to take a proper look at it.
[07:04:32] <Cork> 04/03/05 now is that 2004-03-05, 2004-03-05 or 2005-04-03...
[07:04:33] <Cork> GAH
[07:04:44] <BillCriswell> Cork: I think when it's just the month and year it's a little less evil
[07:05:10] <BillCriswell> but month, day then year has absolutely no order.
[07:05:10] <R13ose> BillCriswell: On this site: http://ecosanity.org I want to make the thumbnails that popup when you hover the background images to be clickable and go to another page.  I thought allowPagerClickBubble would help but not doing anything.
[07:05:23] <Cork> BillCriswell: well when it went path 2012 it kinda resolves it self
[07:05:40] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah, I was just about to mention that as well.
[07:05:44] <Cork> but before i basically had to try twice every other time...
[07:06:14] <Cork> especially when they don't write what is what
[07:06:33] <R13ose> I like when there is a a guide how to enter the date.
[07:07:43] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Why are you using data-link instead of href?
[07:08:44] <R13ose> BillCriswell: because I want to link the thumbnail images instead of the background images.
[07:09:15] <ewz> Cork I only used that date format because the datepicker couldn't handle "2015-01-09" it thought it was the day before
[07:09:16] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I feel like everything you're doing with this slideshow is going against every intuition I have.
[07:10:04] <R13ose> BillCriswell: well what is your intuition, telling you?
[07:10:21] <BillCriswell> That the big giant thing people are looking at would be clickable.
[07:12:27] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I can make that clear to them but at the moment they want the thumbnails to be clickable.
[07:12:44] <ewz> Cork the bottom line is I can get my date format into any date format, it doesn't have to be "01/15/2015" so what format does it need to be in to make this work
[07:12:58] <BillCriswell> R13ose: They won't see the slide at all if they don't have a mouse.
[07:13:10] <BillCriswell> R13ose: But one second I should be able to help.
[07:13:27] <Cork> ewz: your best bet is to give it a full date string all the way down to seconds
[07:13:48] <Cork> the format is defined in the Date page
[07:13:53] <Cork> ?g mdn date
[07:13:54] <b-ot> Cork: Date - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[07:14:02] <ewz> OK so "01/15/2015 00:00:00.000"
[07:14:03] <R13ose> BillCriswell: well, maybe changing this so they don't need a mouse to see this would be good.
[07:14:03] <Cork> but don'
[07:14:20] <Cork> ewz: date only supports a few date formats
[07:14:25] <Cork> you have to check it
[07:14:28] <ewz> k
[07:15:37] <Cork> i would personally use the iso 8601 format
[07:15:40] <Cork> but that is just me
[07:16:20] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I thought you said I was using hover too much yesterday so I switched the one that was using hover over to mouseover.
[07:16:57] <BillCriswell> R13ose: mouseover is essentially hovering. A touch input will never recognize those types of events.
[07:17:07] <BillCriswell> R13ose: http://pastie.org/pastes/9822260/text is what I think you're shooting for, though.
[07:20:36] <R13ose> BillCriswell: one thing I am confused about is why var $slide has a $ there?
[07:21:20] <BillCriswell> R13ose: It's just to let other author potentially know it's a jQuery variable.
[07:21:46] <R13ose> BillCriswell: okay I was asking if this was right or not
[07:22:39] <BillCriswell> R13ose: It's a total preference. You can remove it if you'd like.
[07:23:53] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I thought I was able to use prop because I am using a version of jQuery where this was not used.
[07:24:25] <BillCriswell> R13ose: If that's the case then just switch it back to attr
[07:26:48] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I updated the code but I still can't get the thumbnails to link to another page.
[07:27:14] <R13ose> BillCriswell: meaning if I click the thumbnails, they do nothing.  What they should do is open to the page they are linked to.
[07:29:04] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Then pageAnchorBuilder must do e.preventDefault on the links created.
[07:30:08] <R13ose> BillCriswell: how?
[07:34:31] <R13ose> BillCriswell: would this be just adding e.preventDefault to pageAnchorBuilder but instead idx.preventDefault?
[07:36:27] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Adding this should do it: http://pastie.org/pastes/9822305/text
[07:36:52] <BillCriswell> Only doing that because I don't want to reimplement the pager.
[07:37:16] <R13ose> BillCriswell: changing all the code is crazy
[07:38:20] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Yeah I didn't want to go through that.
[07:38:29] <BillCriswell> At least for someone else haha
[07:38:46] <R13ose> BillCriswell: hahaha
[07:41:43] <R13ose> BillCriswell: thanks that worked.  Can I pm you about a CSS question as the other channel is not helping.
[07:42:06] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Nah have to get some stuff done today. I just saved you a bunch of hours so you should be good!
[07:42:47] <R13ose> BillCriswell: thanks.  At least I know that I need to redo the whole slideshow thing sooner rather than later.
[07:43:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah, hopefully, because that thing is an accessibility nightmare.
[07:43:49] <hrust> I need a selector for dynamic added data attribute to td table cell. If I select with $('td[data-type="value"]') it doesnt work but if I itterate with $.each() I can access to attribute with $(this).data('type')
[07:44:05] <R13ose> BillCriswell: meaning for people without a mouse?
[07:44:15] <Cork> hrust: .data() doesn't add the data to the dom
[07:44:23] <Cork> it stores it in an internal cache in jquery
[07:44:29] <Cork> you can't use selector on it
[07:44:35] <hrust> oh
[07:44:48] <Cork> hrust: you could either use .filter or use .attr() instead of .data
[07:44:57] <Cork> but not .attr can't store all the data types .data can
[07:45:36] <hrust> Crok: thanks I`ll try
[07:47:18] <hrust> Crok: how can I select every x element of select set
[07:47:19] <hrust> ?
[07:47:39] <BillCriswell> R13ose: and people with some motor disabilities. Hovering over a box like that isn't the simplest of tasks for a lot of people and those links only working through click events kill it for keyboard navigation.
[07:47:45] <cjohnson> hrust: what do you mean
[07:48:02] <BillCriswell> nth-child() ?
[07:48:02] <cjohnson> you can use .filter to filter down a jquery collection
[07:48:11] <cjohnson> or you can make your selector more specific
[07:48:21] <hrust> cjohnson: i need all td elements of specific table row
[07:48:25] <Cork> hrust: you could use :nth-child or :odd/:even depending on what you need
[07:48:39] <cjohnson> hrust: $thatRow.find('td')
[07:48:55] <hrust> column* :)
[07:49:00] <Cork> cjohnson: that isn't what he asked
[07:49:06] <R13ose> BillCriswell: right I will make sure people know that
[07:49:12] <hrust> sorry
[07:49:16] <hrust> row
[07:49:23] <cjohnson> yes it is Cork
[07:49:23] <Cork> hrust: tr td:nth-child(2)
[07:49:34] <hrust> oooh
[07:49:38] <hrust> thats it yes
[07:49:45] <hrust> thanks alot guys
[07:50:26] <BillCriswell> If you want a specific row it would be $('tr:eq(2) td')
[07:50:57] <Cork> it could be nth-child there too
[07:51:21] <Cork> its faster so you want to use it if can do the job
[07:51:26] <BillCriswell> I just went by "i need all td elements of specific table row" lol
[07:51:49] <cjohnson> mhm
[07:52:17] <Technical_13> How do I wrap an element in another element?  eg  How do I turn `<p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p>` into <div id="allstuff"><p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p></div>`?
[07:52:34] <hrust> BillCriswell: Croks`s answer is what I need :)
[07:52:45] <Cork> Technical_13: $('<div>').append(your_content)
[07:52:50] <Cork> or you can use .wrap
[07:53:07] <Cork> i've had .wrap break things for me to be a bit careful with it
[07:54:01] <Technical_13> Okay, now... How do I get all the chunks of  `<p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p>` when they are `<h3>title</h3><p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p><h3>title</h3><p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p><h3>title</h3><p>stuff</p><p>morestuff</p>`?
[07:54:13] <Cork> ?paste @ Technical_13
[07:54:13] <b-ot> Technical_13: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:54:26] <Technical_13> Yeah, working on it. :p
[07:54:55] <Technical_13> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/
[07:55:05] <BillCriswell> hrust: oK cool haha
[07:56:32] <Cork> Technical_13: http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/1/
[07:57:45] <Technical_13> Cork: Doesn't seem to do anything.
[07:57:58] <Cork> inspect the preview dom :)
[07:58:07] <Cork> you should see the divs there
[07:59:03] <Cork> Technical_13: http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/3/
[07:59:14] <Technical_13> http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/2/
[08:00:36] <Technical_13> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/4/
[08:00:43] <Cork> echhttp://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/5/ you didn't close the id attribute
[08:00:51] <Cork> * http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/5/ you didn't close the id attribute
[08:03:41] <Technical_13> Ahh. http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/7/ seems to work.. Thanks. :)
[08:29:47] <Fishy> $('#cont a).attr('onclick',$(this).attr('href')); so obviously this doesnt work..but im not sure how to update the onclick with the current href
[08:30:14] <R13ose> afk
[08:30:28] <Paladine> hey peeps, I am looking at prevAll() and wondered if there is a way in jQuery to select all previous siblings and the trigger sibling and change their background colours to different colours?
[08:31:39] <Paladine> so say for example I have 10 items in a list and the user hovers of item number 5 - I want to change the background colour of items 1,2,3,4 & 5 and I want them all to have different background colours
[08:31:50] <Paladine> anyone know how I might do that?
[08:31:51] <BillCriswell> Paladine: Loop through prevAll() and apply a random color.
[08:31:54] <Cork> Paladine: $(this).prevAll().addBack().color()
[08:32:06] <Cork> ah
[08:32:23] <Cork> and... .color()???
[08:32:48] <Paladine> thanks
[08:33:02] <Cork> Paladine: $(this).prevAll().addBack().each(function() { $(this).css('background-color', <color>); })
[08:33:52] <Paladine> thanks Cork, it is for a temperature based rating system and the only examples I could find were for star rating systems which didn't achieve what I wanted
[08:34:45] <BillCriswell> Paladine: http://jsbin.com something like this?
[08:35:27] <BillCriswell> Paladine: http://jsbin.com/joqayecugu/2/edit?js,output there we go
[08:35:58] <Paladine> basically yes thanks
[08:36:26] <Paladine> that is a perfect example for me to work from, much appreciated
[08:36:39] <BillCriswell> Oh nice, hsl() must rotate back or whatever when it goes over 360.
[08:36:48] <BillCriswell> Paladine: No problem.
[08:53:41] <rfish> is there a danger of CSRF attacks while using jquery ajax?
[08:54:08] <rfish> from my understanding, ajax can't go cross domain so there is no danger
[08:54:14] <robertmaxrees> ajax can, actually.
[08:54:18] <robertmaxrees> unless your server disallows it.
[08:55:12] <rfish> so it is the server that disallows it, not the browser?
[08:55:22] <robertmaxrees> the browser follows whatever the server tells it.
[08:55:35] <robertmaxrees> the server is the one that says it does or does not allow CORS.
[08:55:46] <robertmaxrees> the browser is then supposed to respect that instruction.
[08:59:09] <rfish> and even then, ajax won't send my websites cookies from the attackers website
[08:59:34] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about who's doing what in those scenarios :)
[08:59:45] <robertmaxrees> basically, disallow CORS unless you have a REALLY good reason for it.
[08:59:52] <rfish> ok
[09:00:11] <robertmaxrees> and even then, only expose data that doesn't need to be protected in some way.
[09:00:30] <robertmaxrees> because the entire point of disallowing cross-site requests is because you're requesting from the other domain as the user.
[09:00:43] <robertmaxrees> has little to do with what page they're making the request from.
[09:02:04] <rfish> well if the user is logged in via session id from the cookie
[09:02:23] <rfish> and a user lands on a phishing site
[09:02:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not a phising attack.
[09:02:57] <rfish> and the phising site sends my site a request to withdraw all their money
[09:03:20] <rfish> and lets say I even do allow cors
[09:03:28] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting attacks.
[09:03:49] <rfish> it will fail because the phishing site doesn't have access to the cookies from my site
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> let's say gmail allowed CORS.  you could land on my site, which would then request mail.google.com and scrape it.  if you're authenticated, your cookies and session would be used.
[09:04:07] <robertmaxrees> my site doesn't need access to the cookies for the other domain.
[09:04:54] <rfish> really, the cookies from mail.google.com would be sent from your site?
[09:05:06] <robertmaxrees> has nothing to do with my site.
[09:05:22] <robertmaxrees> mail.google.com asks to see if you have any cookies for it and your browser happily says "yep!" and hands them over.
[09:05:49] <rfish> that is pretty insecure
[09:05:55] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:06:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why CORS is generally disabled by default.
[09:06:49] <rfish> so since I disable cors, I don't need to bother with CSRF tokens?
[09:07:43] <Technical_13> can I get some help with http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/8/ - Why am I getting nothing back in my console for the `console.warn( '%O', thisSections );`?
[09:07:59] <robertmaxrees> rfish read https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet
[09:08:20] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 fix the syntax error first.
[09:08:28] <Technical_13> The idea is to build an array with all the sections and then be able to sort them by thisSorter
[09:08:43] <warehouse13> is there a difference between :not() and not() ?
[09:09:47] <robertmaxrees> warehouse13 :not() is going to be slower than .not()
[09:09:59] <warehouse13> oh i see
[09:10:26] <robertmaxrees> warehouse13 also chaining .not() is more readable imo
[09:11:00] <Technical_13> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/9/
[09:11:46] <warehouse13> ok thanks robertmaxrees .. I was a bit confused they had the same name... thanks I'll avoid :not
[09:11:57] <Technical_13> Strange.  I get it back in jsfiddle but not in my live script...
[09:12:47] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 why are you chaining two .done() calls like that?
[09:13:08] <BillCriswell> dun dun.
[09:13:17] <robertmaxrees> SUPADONE
[09:13:28] <Technical_13> because I can?
[09:13:50] <robertmaxrees> just seems strange.
[09:14:13] <Technical_13> non-js people will have to be able to read the code and make some kind of sense of it, seems the logical way to make that doable.
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> using promises already defeats that then lol
[09:14:49] <robertmaxrees> do your backend guys write code in a way that's easy for the frontend guys to understand?
[09:15:02] <Technical_13> This is for something on Wikipedia...
[09:15:10] <Technical_13> So, yes.
[09:15:11] <Technical_13> :p
[09:15:15] <robertmaxrees> D:
[09:15:20] <robertmaxrees> that's an interesting approach.
[09:16:17] <Technical_13> My goal is to be able to order the sections on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Requests_for_closure by a weighted scale of how long each discussion has been waiting for resolution.
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[09:17:17] <Technical_13> So, the first function turns each section into it's own div, the second function gets the type and how many days it has been waiting to make the weighted sorting value.
[09:17:53] <Technical_13> I just need to get each of those into an array and sort them.  Then, I can remove the existing sections and append the sorted secitons to the end.
[09:18:33] <robertmaxrees> var thisRaw = $(this).attr('class').match(/.*?([\d]*)_([\w]*).*/); - what's this trying to do?
[09:18:48] <robertmaxrees> (i'm lazy and don't want to parse out the regex haha)
[09:19:28] <Technical_13> http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05 is the whole code I've got so far.
[09:19:35] <IoP_> robertmaxrees: left eye: *?([\d]*), right eye: ([\w]*). Left ear is gigantic if compared to right one.
[09:19:42] <Technical_13> lol
[09:19:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:20:54] <Technical_13> there is a class span added by a template used on that page that is classed as "wpRfC (number of days)_(type of request)"
[09:21:13] <Technical_13> So, the regex pulls the number of days and type from that.
[09:21:23] <IoP_> robertmaxrees: looks like it's finding digit followed by _ and word
[09:21:24] <Technical_13>  		var initiatedType = initiatedRaw[ 2 ];
[09:21:25] <robertmaxrees> any way you guys could change that to be in a data attribute instead?
[09:21:32] <robertmaxrees> so you don't need to parse out the data like that?
[09:21:49] <robertmaxrees> also, be careful with things like content: $(this).parents('div.that').html();
[09:21:53] <robertmaxrees> (just general comments)
[09:21:57] <Technical_13> Nope, the mediawiki parser strips everything that isn't a name, id, class, or style.
[09:21:59] <IoP_> What is the idea of ".*?" ? that looks weird
[09:22:25] <Technical_13> everything up to...
[09:23:49] <Technical_13> The parsing part is fine.  It's the putting it in the array and/or being able to get that data back after.
[09:23:49] <Technical_13> The first function, with the help of Cork, works flawlessly.  The second function get's all the values, but I can't seem to see what the array comming back is.
[09:24:41] <Cork> IoP_: regex *? is none greedy match
[09:24:54] <Cork> meaning match until the character after it matches and stop there
[09:26:13] <Technical_13> Cork: any ideas?
[09:26:33] <Cork> Technical_13: haven't seen that start of the conversation and i'm a bit busy
[09:27:17] <Technical_13> Cork: Thanks anyways. :)  Just wondering why the console.warn() isn't returning anything in http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05
[09:27:26] * Technical_13 goes to make tea
[09:28:01] <Cork> Technical_13: you aren't wrapping it in a function() {}
[09:30:14] <Technical_13> Cork: I tried with and without and no change in the console on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Requests_for_closure#Several_RfDs
[09:30:52] <Cork> well you still have to add the function wrapper
[09:30:58] <Cork> it can't work without it
[09:32:09] <Cork> also you have a comma after the function in line 46
[09:32:10] <Technical_13> http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05
[09:32:29] <Cork> Technical_13: all done calls
[09:32:36] <Technical_13> Cork: The strange part is that http://jsfiddle.net/p7fmtwna/9/ works...
[09:32:47] <Technical_13> what do you mean?
[09:32:55] <Cork> either you need to do .done(createSections) or .done(function() { createSections(); })
[09:33:01] <zagaza> should you be able to use multiple jquery ui datepickers on the same page by default?
[09:33:05] <Cork> you can't do what you're doing
[09:33:13] <desophos> hey robertmaxrees, thanks for the help yesterday; i eventually kind of fixed some of the problems i was having and you helped a lot. also, i did have the problem in the stackoverflow post you linked, i just didn't notice it until later :p so thanks!
[09:33:29] <robertmaxrees> desophos awesome!  glad i could help!
[09:33:49] <robertmaxrees> zagaza you can do that, no problem.
[09:34:32] <zagaza> robertmaxrees it doesn't work for me :/
[09:34:54] <robertmaxrees> zagaza can you show us?
[09:35:12] <zagaza> unfortunately I've got it for my wordpress admin area, but i'll create a fiddle
[09:35:20] <robertmaxrees> that would be perfect.
[09:35:21] <Technical_13> Cork: You mean like http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05 (updated)?
[09:35:39] <robertmaxrees> zagaza because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c0vh331b/
[09:37:50] <Cork> hmm can done take several callbacks?
[09:38:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ yep
[09:38:09] <Cork> ah, yes it does
[09:38:21] <Cork> Technical_13: so yes, that should work
[09:38:36] <Technical_13> It doesn't.
[09:38:42] <robertmaxrees> Huh?
[09:38:43] <zagaza> robertmaxrees hmm this is weird, it works for me in jsfiddle but not in my wordpress admin area
[09:38:55] <robertmaxrees> zagaza any console errors or anything?
[09:39:14] <zagaza> nah :/
[09:39:26] <Cork> Technical_13: what happens?
[09:39:58] <Technical_13> I get nothing.
[09:40:39] <Cork> Technical_13: you would have to try to break down the problem
[09:40:52] <Cork> cause the deferred part should work
[09:41:20] <Technical_13> I even just wrapped it with $( document ).ready( function () { ... } ); http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05 and get nothing (because I noticed playing with the fiddle that if No wrap - in <head> then the array is empty
[09:41:52] <Cork> Technical_13: break down as in for example comment out all the code in the functions and check if they run
[09:42:02] <Cork> with a console.log() or similar
[09:42:19] <Cork> cause like i said the deferred section should work
[09:42:47] <Cork> (also use jsfiddle.net so we can actually run the code)
[09:48:06] <Technical_13> Cork: The example on jsfiddle works though...
[09:48:22] <Cork> well then you have a clue :)
[09:48:31] <Technical_13> it's running http://pastebin.com/LDieGv05 in the js console on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Requests_for_closure#Several_RfDs that isn't returning anything.
[09:48:35] <Cork> you have to find the difference between what happens on jsfiddle and your local copy
[09:49:13] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 that works for me.
[09:49:54] <Technical_13> It doesn't tell me it's making babies or when it is done making babies but it does tell me the `Raw: %s :Type: %s :Mod: %s :Ago: %d :Sorter: %d` info
[09:52:29] * Technical_13 facepalms.
[09:52:36] <Technical_13> I figured it out.   Thanks guys...
[09:52:40] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[09:52:56] <Technical_13> I forgot I had a filter set in my js console for `RfDs`
[09:52:59] * Technical_13 facepalms.
[09:53:10] <robertmaxrees> I was about toi start suggesting looking at your console settings.
[09:53:31] <Technical_13> Where are my trout?
[09:54:57] <Technical_13> !api sort
[09:54:57] <Technical_13> next question...
[09:54:57] <b-ot> Technical_13: No matches.
[09:55:03] <Technical_13> !api sort()
[09:55:03] <b-ot> Technical_13: No matches.
[09:56:23] <Technical_13> !api .unique()
[09:56:23] <b-ot> Technical_13: No matches.
[09:56:29] <Technical_13> !api unique
[09:56:30] <b-ot> Technical_13: No matches.
[09:56:32] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 what are you looking for?
[09:56:38] <Technical_13> b-ot  -you're lame.
[09:57:10] <Technical_13> I need to sort that array by the value of the sorter
[09:57:21] <Technical_13> and remove dups
[09:57:22] <robertmaxrees> none of those are jquery methods...
[09:57:37] <Technical_13> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/ ?
[09:57:38] <robertmaxrees> !mdn array.prototype.sort
[09:57:40] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Array.prototype.sort() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[09:57:52] <robertmaxrees> !api jQuery.unique()
[09:57:52] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No matches.
[09:57:59] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[09:58:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not suitable for your case though.
[09:58:49] <craftbynick> hi
[09:59:16] <Technical_13> got it, thanks.
[09:59:30] <Omar-> hi craftbynick
[10:01:57] <Technical_13> robertmaxrees: initiatedSections.sort( function ( a, b ) { ( a.Sorter > b.Sorter ) ? 1 : ( a.Sorter < b.Sorter ) ? -1 : 0; } );//Should do it, right?
[10:02:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to return the result of the sort.
[10:03:37] <robertmaxrees> also, i'd avoid nesting ternaries like that.
[10:04:04] <Technical_13> robertmaxrees: initiatedSections.sort( function ( a, b ) { var v = ( a.Sorter > b.Sorter ) ? 1 : ( a.Sorter < b.Sorter ) ? -1 : 0; return v; } );//Should do it, right?
[10:04:36] <Omar-> something like this would work for .sort()? http://jsfiddle.net/9hq6r10z/
[10:04:52] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 i'm having a really hard time reading that nested ternary today hahaha
[10:04:55] <Technical_13> :p
[10:05:15] <Technical_13> I like nesting ternaries. :p
[10:05:28] <Technical_13> Omar-: My example here worked. ;)
[10:05:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd reject that in our codebase.
[10:05:45] <Technical_13> Now... tack a .reverse() on that...
[10:06:00] <Omar-> Technical_13 mine is lighter :P
[10:06:29] <Technical_13> Omar-: yours doesn't acount for when a=b
[10:06:45] <Omar-> Technical_13 oh, you want to remove duplicates too
[10:06:51] <Omar-> mine only sorts
[10:07:28] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ezjuyhx/ should work.
[10:07:48] <robertmaxrees> which is the de-ternary'd version of your code, Technical_13.
[10:08:04] <robertmaxrees> so yours should work, though returning from within ternaries like that is really funky.
[10:08:26] <choosegoose> my jquery-ui-datepicker is giving me a "Value must be 07/22/2015 or earlier" when I have maxDate = "+1y". I grepped/searched "Value must be" in both my backend code and all of the resources that the browser downloads for the webpage, and have found it nowhere.
[10:08:36] <Technical_13> Works great (although I'm not sure how older browsers handle it and I'll likely change it once the whole script is working).
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 should be fine in IE 5.5 and above.
[10:09:07] <choosegoose> it doesn't seem that my form even "submits" before this popup happens.
[10:09:22] <Technical_13> This is Wikipedia we are talking about...
[10:09:40] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 not sure what browser support they're shooting for.
[10:10:01] <Technical_13> There very well may be people using versions of IE and whatever else older than that.  4.0 or better is generally preferred.
[10:10:08] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose that's interesting,.
[10:10:20] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 you might need to include a shim for it then.
[10:10:31] <Technical_13> shim?
[10:10:38] <Technical_13> Never heard that term before
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> code that backfills the functionality for you.
[10:10:47] <Valduare> good morning robertmaxrees
[10:11:07] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[10:14:43] <R13ose> BillCriswell: Hi.  The arrow on the bottom right side of the scren.  If you click on this, I am trying to flip from one arrow image to the other and change the link too.  I know I am doing this wrong, arrow.js is the page.
[10:15:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:16:10] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I know right
[10:16:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm laughing because you're just sort of making a whole bunch of assumptions with your statement ;)
[10:17:37] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I know but I feel that way
[10:18:13] <robertmaxrees> i mean you're assuming bill is here, that he can help you, that he knows what you're talking about, etc.
[10:20:25] <cariveri> Hey var bg = $(this).css('background-image'); gets the absolute file path. what I want is the relative path ro reinsert it later without exposing my file structure.
[10:20:54] <choosegoose> I set "novalidate" on my form and it stopped validating my dates on the ui-datepicker. Why is there validation and where is it set up?
[10:21:06] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I understand that
[10:21:12] <robertmaxrees> cariveri "without exposing my file structure" ? it's already "exposed"
[10:21:31] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose are you sure you're not using a bootstrap validator?
[10:21:33] <ZionZee> Hi! I need some help! my like button able to work with only one like button code in a js, but if i duplicate it and made it become unlike button why is it unable to work? this is the code: http://jsbin.com/qebaqonida/1/edit?js
[10:21:41] <choosegoose> robertmaxrees, looks like I may be
[10:21:42] <robertmaxrees> choosegoose or datepicker, rather.
[10:22:20] <cariveri> robertmaxrees: perhaps. but Id liek to reinsert the relative path as written in css section.
[10:22:23] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee are you replacing the button with a different ID?
[10:22:40] <ZionZee> make another button with diff id
[10:22:52] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee read http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:32:14] <ZionZee> <robertmaxrees: sorry I can't get it..
[10:32:35] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: sorry I can't get it.. i just want to create another button on the same html page
[10:32:48] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee so #qnsDislikes doesn't exist when the page loads, right?
[10:33:18] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: it exists but it doesn't +1 vote when click the dislike button
[10:33:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:33:30] <robertmaxrees> can you add the relevant markup then?
[10:34:40] <cariveri> robertmaxrees: so. is there either a way to keep relative paths?
[10:34:54] <robertmaxrees> cariveri not without exposing that data separately or parsing it out.
[10:35:37] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/cevecademi/1/edit
[10:35:50] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee ...
[10:35:54] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the javascript there.
[10:35:57] <robertmaxrees> one bin with both.
[10:36:04] <robertmaxrees> and the rendered html, not the template code.
[10:38:57] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: hhttp://jsbin.com/cevecademi/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:39:03] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/cevecademi/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:39:19] <Zebba_de> I'm using DataTables in a form. After trying a couple of things I found on the web: how do I make sure all checked <input>-fields even from the non-active pages are submitted with the form?
[10:39:34] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee errr.
[10:39:35] <cariveri> robertmaxrees: hmm. the url that is returned from $(this).css('background-image') is from the server, right? or is it from the client's cache?
[10:39:54] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee sorry, i'm asking for the rendered html, not the template code.  i thought i'd asked for that.
[10:40:31] <robertmaxrees> cariveri it's however the browser reports that back iirc.
[10:40:40] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember the ins and outs.
[10:40:46] <robertmaxrees> why can you just use the returned value?
[10:41:41] <greyhat> can you guys tell me if this is a scope issue or an async issue https://dpaste.de/mVmh
[10:41:54] <cariveri> its a pretty long and by I thought it is revealing the servers directories instead of relative paths.
[10:41:56] <robertmaxrees> greyhat both
[10:42:06] <robertmaxrees> cariveri i can get those paths anyway.
[10:42:06] <greyhat> robert_: how can i fix it?
[10:42:13] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: you mean i do a screenshot let u see?
[10:42:13] <greyhat> erm robertmaxrees rather
[10:42:22] <robertmaxrees> greyhat depends.
[10:42:29] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee i meant he actual HTML in the browser.
[10:42:33] <cariveri> robertmaxrees: by changing the js code, I guess.
[10:42:52] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: on what?
[10:42:54] <robertmaxrees> cariveri or by looking in the network panel of my browser.
[10:43:11] <robertmaxrees> greyhat any code that relies on project_acronym needs to be in that function.
[10:43:19] <robertmaxrees> or you call it and pass that value.
[10:43:33] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/cevecademi/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:44:04] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: first option is impossible. how would i accomplish the second option? just function(data, project_acronym) { .... } ?
[10:44:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:44:30] <robertmaxrees> any logic that relies on that get call needs to be called explicitly.
[10:44:49] <robertmaxrees> which is basically the same thing as the first, just a different way to do it.
[10:45:04] <greyhat> called inside the get call
[10:45:14] <greyhat> inside the getjson call
[10:45:16] <robertmaxrees> the get callback.
[10:45:20] <greyhat> yeah
[10:45:22] <greyhat> ok
[10:45:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[10:45:35] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/cevecademi/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:45:42] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee i saw it.
[10:45:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:45:59] <robertmaxrees> greyhat actually, i misspoke - not a scope issue, but it is an async issue.
[10:46:05] <robertmaxrees> stick that var inside that callback anyway.
[10:47:27] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee that code works.
[10:47:54] <robertmaxrees> assuming the Ajax is returning what you think it is.
[10:48:05] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: i'm jamming a ton of code in there just to access that variable
[10:48:09] <greyhat> annoying but eh
[10:48:15] <robertmaxrees> greyhat err.
[10:48:16] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:48:32] <robertmaxrees> create functions and call them.
[10:48:48] <greyhat> eh
[10:48:52] <greyhat> not 'a ton'
[10:48:58] <robertmaxrees> still a good idea.
[10:49:00] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: hhuh?
[10:49:15] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee the code that you showed me appears to work.
[10:49:33] <ZionZee> it updates the number of like or dislike?
[10:49:47] <cariveri> robertmaxrees: its allright. I just got confused because of the filepath being displayed. but that was because of opening it locally instead of opening via http. if one gets tired one gets nervous.
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee obviously that part won't work because the $.get() doesn't work.
[10:50:26] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee so I can't speak to the $.get(); parts, but the rest of the code works.
[10:50:35] <robertmaxrees> also - http://jsbin.com/zivujociba/1/edit use .data() for those data attributes.
[10:51:31] <ZionZee> ok thanks
[10:53:09] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: but it is ok to put both click function into one js rite?
[10:53:50] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee one JS file you mean?
[10:54:00] <ZionZee> yup
[10:54:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, totally legit.
[11:15:48] <notchris> I’m getting “events is not defined” any ideas why? http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/hours/
[11:15:55] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/XiSwdTwV
[11:16:22] <robertmaxrees> because there's no "events" variable.
[11:17:10] <robertmaxrees> has to do with $('#calendar').bic_calendar({});
[11:18:12] <notchris> @robertmaxrees I’ve been trying for like 3 hours
[11:18:19] <notchris> Cant seem to get it to recognize events
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> where are you defining the variable?
[11:19:22] <notchris> @robertmaxrees see where events.push is? it used to look like...
[11:19:27] <robertmaxrees> where?
[11:19:37] <robertmaxrees> oh the pastebind
[11:19:49] <robertmaxrees> that variable doesn't exist outside of that function.
[11:19:50] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/i4nB0rJ7
[11:19:51] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> scoping.
[11:20:46] <notchris> hmmm
[11:20:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to put the bic_calendar() init in that same scope.
[11:29:58] <Zzaichik> anyone know of a good jquery plugin that will give the appearance the text is being typed on the screen?
[11:30:27] <robertmaxrees> typed.js maybe?
[11:33:24] <Zzaichik> perfect. thanks robertmaxrees
[11:33:47] <fourq> anyone that uses the jquery-cookie plugin, can you take a look at this screen shot and tell me if you can see why I'm unable to read this simple cookie? http://screencast.com/t/oVK3fP4P9Pc
[11:34:49] <fourq> something to do with setting the domain or path possibly?
[11:35:43] <robertmaxrees> fourq we'd need an example.
[11:36:13] <fourq> robertmaxrees: of what? that's all the code I have
[11:36:15] <halfdan> Hi there
[11:36:25] <fourq> just trying to see if I can read the value
[11:36:41] <xvicarious> robertmaxrees: I figured it out last night btw.
[11:36:45] <robertmaxrees> fourq in a screenshot :( if you're on the same domain and all that, it should work.
[11:37:17] <fourq> well the screen shot helps see all the cookie values, and imo is easier to read in this instance
[11:37:24] <fourq> and yeah same domain =/
[11:37:25] <xvicarious> Also: I have a .change() event registered for a <select>.  It fires, but no dialogs or datepickers appear next to it.  Is it possible to do this?
[11:37:26] <florian2> Hello! I try to insert pictures with a different clickable area (for an isometric game) and i tried with this http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap but that only work when it's put in the .html
[11:37:32] <robertmaxrees> and i cannot interact with it or use it at all, fourq ;)
[11:37:53] <robertmaxrees> xvicarious i can't remember what i ate for breakfast half the time haha
[11:37:56] <robertmaxrees> not sure what issue you had.
[11:38:07] <fourq> sigh, ok. it was just a simple look and talk is all. thanks
[11:38:08] <fourq> cheers
[11:38:17] <robertmaxrees> florian2 don't listen to w3schools.
[11:38:17] <xvicarious> datepicker on buttons not showing up immediately robertmaxrees
[11:38:30] <florian2> lol why
[11:38:32] <halfdan> I am trying to "subclass" a jquery plugin. I am trying to do $.fn.myplugin = function(d) { /* Some stuff here */ return $(this).superPlugin.call(this, d); } - That however does not seem to properly work because of, I believe, the return this.each in the superPlugin. Any ideas?
[11:38:37] <robertmaxrees> because they're often wrong.
[11:39:00] <florian2> ok i didn't know
[11:39:08] <robertmaxrees> check out MDN.
[11:39:19] <florian2> but that work when i insert in the html but not with jquery or js only
[11:39:27] <florian2> ok
[11:39:30] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle it up?
[11:39:48] <robertmaxrees> your example, I mean.
[11:40:11] <florian2> yes
[11:40:15] <florian2> 2 seconds
[11:42:51] <florian2> var fond =$("<img id="+IDCurArea+"  class="+grassSelected+" usemap=#"+curArea+"></img>");
[11:42:51] <florian2> var map= $("<map name="+curArea+" id="+mapIDCurArea+"><area shape='poly' coords='"+x0+","+y0+","+x1+","+y1+","+x2+","+y2+","+x3+","+y3+"' href='http://google.fr' alt='zone cliquable'></map>");
[11:42:51] <florian2> $(map).append(area);
[11:43:05] <florian2> with jquery and i tried to with js
[11:43:12] <florian2> only*
[11:43:59] <florian2> and $("#container").append(map);
[11:44:19] <xvicarious> I have a .change() event registered for a <select>.  It fires, but no dialogs or datepickers appear next to it.  Is it possible to do this?
[11:46:16] <florian2> robertmaxrees: i sent the code up
[11:46:38] <robertBusy> florian2 i have some things I need to work on, but if you create a functioning example on jsfiddle, you'll probably get some good help.
[11:46:57] <notchris> I stopped the events error
[11:46:59] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/hours/
[11:47:08] <notchris> But still they wont load into the calendar
[11:47:19] <florian2> ok thank you good evening! :)
[11:47:23] <notchris> And my objects are set up as the working static ones were
[12:35:49] <BillCriswell> robertBusy: http://jsfiddle.net/nsxn0yk8/ any idea here? It's starting to bother me. events2 populates the calendar, events doesn't. They're both structured the same.
[12:39:13] <robertBusy> woah
[12:41:22] <BillCriswell> It's making my brain hurt.
[12:42:48] <robertBusy> the only difference is where those vars are defined.
[12:45:14] <BillCriswell> robertBusy: Someone in ##javascript got it pretty quick lol
[12:45:27] <robertBusy> something about that $.each() is async?
[12:45:36] <robertBusy> aaah date formats.
[12:45:37] <BillCriswell> It was the no leading 0 for the month.
[12:45:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[12:45:41] <robertBusy> fffffffffff
[12:45:50] <robertBusy> wow.
[12:45:55] <robertBusy> it's always something simple.
[12:54:13] <BillCriswell> That was annoying.
[12:54:33] <robertBusy> right?
[12:56:27] <FoolsRun> hey, can someone confirm I'm not going crazy?  the $(this)  for   $(".acf-fields").find("input").change()  should be the input tag, right?
[12:56:41] <robertBusy> generally.
[12:57:34] <FoolsRun> I'm trying to, whenever there's a change to an input, update an element nearby.  There are three sets of inputs, and three nearby elements. For some reason my code is always targeting the FIRST set.
[12:58:06] <robertBusy> make sure you're not munging your .parents()/.closest() calls and other similar dom traversal methods.
[12:58:30] <FoolsRun> I'm using parents
[12:58:38] <robertBusy> mind sharing a fiddle?
[12:58:49] <FoolsRun> Not sure it'll make much sense, but sure
[12:59:19] <FoolsRun> http://jsfiddle.net/7aamsho7/
[12:59:36] <robertmaxrees> with markup?
[12:59:54] <FoolsRun> Markup's gonna be a mess, but I'll try hang on
[13:00:06] <blazeme8> Hey, i’m using this snippet to look at window size in IE10: http://pastebin.com/d0gbY220
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> basically, i'm wondering if .parents() is tripping you up.
[13:00:26] <blazeme8> however, if i resize the page after document.ready has fired but before the other resources on the page have loaded
[13:00:31] <blazeme8> only the initial width is printed
[13:00:38] <blazeme8> instead of the final width of hte browser after resizing
[13:00:48] <blazeme8> what’s up with that?
[13:02:23] <blazeme8> furthermore, when $(window).trigger("resize”); is run a little later in the same JS file, nothing is printed
[13:02:30] <FoolsRun> Bloody hell it works in the fiddle.
[13:02:58] <blazeme8> i can’t think of any reason for this other than jquery behaving badly for an unknown reason
[13:03:17] <robertmaxrees> blazeme8 i'm testing IE10 and it's fine.
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> at least in a fiddle.
[13:03:30] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: IE11 emulating IE10?
[13:03:33] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> IE10 in a VM.
[13:03:41] <blazeme8> Okay good
[13:03:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5dsczght/ seems to work fine.
[13:07:54] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: different situation, there’s no time to resize the window while it’s loading
[13:08:03] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[13:08:15] <blazeme8> Oh, i forgot the weirdest part
[13:08:26] <blazeme8> It’s only happening on a cache clear and refresh
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> that means there's a race condition somewhere.
[13:08:43] <blazeme8> f5, ctrl f5, shift f5, doesnt trigger it
[13:08:54] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: in that tiny snippet?
[13:08:58] <robertmaxrees> in your page.
[13:09:24] <blazeme8> i can’t imagine how
[13:09:36] <robertmaxrees> something is mucking with the page.
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) without seeing the actual bug, it's kind of hard to help, y'know?
[13:09:55] <robertmaxrees> somebody else might know something.
[13:10:18] <blazeme8> yeah, ill try to repro in some sort of fiddle
[13:11:11] <blazeme8> jsfiddle seems to cloak the page until everything is loaded
[13:11:15] <blazeme8> so thats not really useful lol
[13:11:55] <blazeme8> i get the compatibility view warning on jsfiddle too. thats different from my page
[13:13:05] <blazeme8> what i dont understand is how my original snippet (http://pastebin.com/d0gbY220) could possibly be printing a window width that is not the actual width of the window
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> bad markup, other scripts doing fuckery, weird css.
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of ways.
[13:14:02] <blazeme8> none of that should matter to the width of hte window, no?
[13:14:06] <blazeme8> width of the document, maybe
[13:14:16] <robertmaxrees> bad markup and other scripts might.
[13:16:43] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: check out this
[13:16:49] <blazeme8> similar to before, but with an extra print
[13:16:50] <blazeme8> http://pastebin.com/3QqzXEnd
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> try using console.log(); instead.
[13:17:25] <FoolsRun> robertmaxrees:  It was parents() vs. closest(). Thank you!
[13:17:27] <blazeme8> that prints out, in chronological order, ready 1: 803, ready 2: 803, timeout: 803
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun awesome :)
[13:17:37] <blazeme8> which means the resize listener HAS to have been attached when the window width is 803
[13:17:50] <blazeme8> however if i type $(window).width() into my console
[13:17:52] <blazeme8> its 720 someodd
[13:17:57] <blazeme8> ill try with console.log intstead
[13:19:21] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: identical result with console.log instead
[13:19:25] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd start ripping out other scripts/css/etc. and see if things change.
[13:24:08] <blazeme8> Ill give that shot
[13:24:16] <islalobo> Hello, looking for help getting this #selectall to work http://jsfiddle.net/0tbbcL4k/
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> islalobo start with the change event.
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> also, there's an easier way :)
[13:28:49] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  Really!? What's the easier way?
[13:29:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0tbbcL4k/2/
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> .prop() assumes the .each() under the hood when writing.
[13:31:21] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: im able to reproduce it after stripping all scripts and stylesheets from my page
[13:31:29] <robertmaxrees> blazeme8 O.oi
[13:31:32] <robertmaxrees> that's... interesting.
[13:31:48] <robertmaxrees> and your page is 100% valid?
[13:31:51] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: i did add some large image tags so i had time to resize the window before they load
[13:32:06] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: only invalid things are some angular attributes.
[13:32:19] <blazeme8> which i suppose i can ditch now, since that script is gone
[13:34:41] <blazeme8> okay, now its valid HTML5
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> It may just be part of the way the layout engine is working.
[13:34:56] <robertmaxrees> but i doubt that.
[13:35:25] <blazeme8> ill try stripping down the page more, i can’t share whats on it currently
[13:35:30] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[13:39:30] <notchris> For some reason, events is defined on one of my pages, but undefined on my index
[13:39:31] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/
[13:39:38] <notchris> Cant figure out why
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> events.forEach(function(value, key) {})
[13:40:01] <robertmaxrees> that line.
[13:40:05] <notchris> Right
[13:40:18] <notchris> Is that unecessary?
[13:40:19] <robertmaxrees> why is that in your index?
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> don't you already have that code elsewhere?
[13:41:00] <notchris> Because the index checks the current date and sees if there is an event today
[13:41:11] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/hours/
[13:41:15] <notchris> That page works
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> events isn't defined in that scope though...
[13:41:37] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: that works great! I'm just trying to integrate it to our site - we're using drupal. I actual want the opposite functionality - when "selectall" is selected the other boxes are not selected — is that possible using the same function?
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> islalobo do what now?
[13:41:56] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: http://198.27.127.96/ie10.html
[13:42:01] <robertmaxrees> islalobo so you want to invert the selectall functionality?
[13:42:08] <blazeme8> reproduced it there
[13:42:21] <blazeme8> youll get the messages in console right away
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> notchris your events object doesn't exist outside of the function that you defined it in.
[13:42:25] <blazeme8> but before the big images load
[13:42:36] <blazeme8> nothing is logged to the console from the resize events
[13:42:52] <notchris> Hmm
[13:43:01] <blazeme8> IE10 only, and only after a cache clear
[13:43:44] <notchris> But I included my dates.js file
[13:43:47] <notchris> Which defines events
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> notchris right, but only in that function.
[13:44:01] <notchris> So I have to copy the whole function?
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> variables created in a function only exist in that function, not outside.
[13:44:11] <ForSpareParts> Is there a way to determine a request’s HTTP method from its jqXHR object?
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> put the index code in there instead, notchris
[13:44:27] <notchris> Hmm
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> blazeme8 iiiinteresting.
[13:44:49] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: right? im not crazy :)
[13:44:53] <ForSpareParts> Alternately, is there any way to get the HTTP method from within a beforeSend event?
[13:45:00] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: if possible
[13:45:18] <notchris> IT WORKS
[13:46:56] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: happens with 2.1.3 also: http://198.27.127.96/ie10_2.html
[13:48:23] <robertmaxrees> file a bug maybe?
[13:48:28] <blazeme8> i think i will
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm kind of at a loss at this point.
[13:48:42] <blazeme8> hmm, why haven’t i stuck a regular html resize event listener in to see if it’s IE or jq
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter in either case ;)
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> JQ should support it.
[13:49:51] <blazeme8> Oooh natural resizes don’t fire either.
[13:50:21] <blazeme8> Jquery is still supposed to work then?
[13:50:58] <robertmaxrees> it should, yeah.
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> it's supposed to fill in those gaps.
[13:51:23] <blazeme8> Gotcha
[13:51:28] <blazeme8> Alright, time to file a bug
[14:04:35] <Paladine> ok so I managed to do what I was trying to do earlier :)
[14:04:38] <Paladine> http://jsbin.com/cuhasiwuce/1/edit?js,output
[14:05:47] <blazeme8> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2001 if you’re interested
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> helluva day
[14:18:56] <MEGAGHZ> woot
[14:19:05] <blazeme8> can’t believe i spent 4 hours this morning COMBING through my code for it to be a jquery bug haha
[14:19:15] <robertmaxrees> IE bug, really.
[14:19:16] <robertmaxrees> butyeah.
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[14:19:27] <MEGAGHZ> og
[14:19:31] <robertmaxrees> it's always the weird stuff.
[14:19:34] <MEGAGHZ> sorry brogrammers
[14:19:49] <robertmaxrees> hey woah
[14:19:49] <blazeme8> i love finding weird bugs with a simple cause
[14:21:20] <blazeme8> well, now I have an excuse to write a terrible piece of code to handle this gap in our frontend :)
[14:28:07] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: hows it going
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> Valduare not too bad.  winding down the week at work.
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[14:34:53] <Valduare> knocking off tasks left and right
[14:35:05] * Valduare updated digital displays with new ads around town
[14:35:14] <robertmaxrees> very cool.
[14:35:16] * Valduare made some new marketing materials 
[14:35:28] * Valduare fixed wifes computer heh
[14:35:40] <Valduare> now to attempt to do something for me
[14:38:20] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: I have a bootstrap setup here - and a bootstrap dropdown button specifically I have not found any decent ways to use a bootstrap dropdown as a select form element. that works .   I have some jquery that will detect what the user clicks on and updates the button -  I assume I need to have a hidden select element that gets updated with jquery based on the activity of this bootstrap dropdown?
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[14:39:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm not terribly familiar with bootstrap, but that sounds about right to me.
[14:40:19] <Valduare> would I be hooking into my existing jquery thats updating the bootstrap dropdown button   or would it be standalone piece of code
[14:40:35] <Valduare> i’ve never seen or done the hidden select stuff so no real idea how to put this together.
[14:40:37] <robertmaxrees> I don't know what you're actually doing so it's hard to visualize.
[14:43:15] <Valduare> http://jsfiddle.net/42Lqvcqu/
[14:43:18] * Valduare made a fiddle
[14:43:58] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[14:58:58] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: I have to run
[14:59:09] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: i’ll be back on later tonight if your on
[15:12:26] <overburn> hey guys , has anyone used jquery widgets with angular?
[15:12:49] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ overburn
[15:12:49] <b-ot> overburn: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:13:31] <overburn> so I can't find where the jqx-on-click directive is defined, if it's defined at all
[15:13:33] <overburn> a bit confusing
[15:13:47] <robertmaxrees> directives are purely the lang of angular IIRC.
[15:49:04] <iman> I am trying to use $.ajax request but I got this message " No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. " how can i get over this?
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> iman do you control the server you're requesting content from?
[15:49:52] <iman> robbyoconnor: yes, that is a java server
[15:50:09] <iman> robertmaxrees: *
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> iman read about CORS then.
[15:50:26] <iman> robbyoconnor: sorry
[15:50:31] <robertmaxrees> or move your code to the same port, protocol, and domain.
[15:50:32] <ntcbow> iman just typed it in myself (php) header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
[15:50:46] <robertmaxrees> don't just enable it blindly.
[15:51:04] <iman> robertmaxrees: okay, thanks
[15:51:08] <ntcbow> robertmaxrees my eyes where wide shut ^^
[15:51:09] <robertmaxrees> that's dangerous
[15:51:22] <ntcbow> not here at home
[15:52:00] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow is the server in question a live application server?
[15:52:07] <robertmaxrees> or just for testing and stuff?
[15:52:14] <ntcbow> more..  less
[15:52:35] <ntcbow> that would be stuff..
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:52:45] <ntcbow> and a little testing
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of dangerous to just allow CORS without considering the ramifications of it
[15:53:42] <ntcbow> the script i put that in was the backend for a bookmark plugin in chrome
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> still important to understand what all that allows.
[15:54:07] <ntcbow> if i ever put that online, there will be some sort of authentication too
[15:54:24] <robertmaxrees> even with auth there are considerations.
[15:54:32] <ntcbow> like what?
[15:55:03] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: if gmail allowed CORS, i could scrape your inbox pretty trivially.
[15:55:16] <ntcbow> http basic auth should shut everybody out, doesn't it?
[15:55:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:55:40] <ntcbow> :(
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> because the ajax request would come from you, which would potentially be authenticated.
[15:55:55] <ntcbow> i don't use gmail.. but i guess thats not the point
[15:56:10] <robertmaxrees> the point is anything that would allow CORS.
[15:56:54] <ntcbow> well.. i don't really get it..
[15:57:20] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[15:57:35] <robertmaxrees> ajax requests act on behalf of the end user - your browser is what's making the request.
[15:57:50] <ntcbow> with that cors thing people can see stuff my server sends them, just like my server is sending out stuff to normal requests
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> so if they're logged into your server, ajax requests to your server act as if they're logged in.  because they are.
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> now i have that data - i can do whatever i want with it.
[15:58:50] <ntcbow> well then, i would have to think twice, what and when my server is responding to whom and when
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:59:10] <ntcbow> business as usual, in the end, isn't it?
[15:59:21] <robertmaxrees> which is why telling people to enable it blindly is a terrible idea.
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> they may not know the ramifications.
[16:00:18] <asdfg> can any one help me with ajax
[16:00:22] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ asdfg
[16:00:22] <b-ot> asdfg: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:00:29] <asdfg> <?php
[16:00:29] <asdfg> $method=$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
[16:00:29] <asdfg> $paths = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
[16:00:29] <asdfg> switch($method) {
[16:00:29] <asdfg>   case 'PUT':
[16:00:37] <ntcbow> to me it somehow appears like the restrictions some companies implemented to their websites regarding being displayed in iframes
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow that's doable, as well.
[16:00:56] <robertmaxrees> and important.
[16:01:30] <ntcbow> well i don't really mind if my stuff ends up in some iframe..
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> you should if I can scrape it.
[16:01:39] <mysuper> helppp
[16:01:41] <robertmaxrees> same problem.
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ mysuper
[16:01:50] <b-ot> mysuper: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:02:11] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow if I can load the iframe and access it via JS, i can scrape it and do the same thing.
[16:02:16] <mysuper> i am calling post method and then get method
[16:02:28] <mysuper> it gives me an suntax error
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow also, allowing iframes is a great way to get ddos'd
[16:02:52] <ntcbow> hmm :/
[16:03:07] <ntcbow> i'm not afraid of anybody/anything :D
[16:03:13] <robertmaxrees> mysuper share your code in a fixee
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> ntcbow my general point is still the same.
[16:03:51] <robertmaxrees> you basically suggested somebody blindly enable CORS without considering what all that means.
[16:03:52] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:04:00] <ntcbow> well in general - you are, of course, absolutely right
[16:04:07] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:04:16] <mysuper> http://jsfiddle.net/vvz0ck68/1/ this is my broblem
[16:04:18] <kingplusplus> please i need helpwith this http://pastebin.com/4t2Naea7 jquery doesnt seem to work http://pastebin.com/4t2Naea7
[16:04:31] <ntcbow> telling him to dig into is probably better, indeed
[16:07:13] <mysuper> http://fixee.org/paste/7e5ygp5/
[16:07:58] <ntcbow> mysuper what does the error say?
[16:09:32] <mysuper> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[16:09:40] <mysuper> i get this
[16:10:38] <ntcbow> kingplusplus & mysuper if you two made actually working jsfiddles it would be easy to help in seconds, but with just that snippet its plain awful
[16:11:06] <ntcbow> mysuper which line?
[16:11:32] <mysuper> line 2
[16:12:20] <mysuper> i have updated my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvz0ck68/4/
[16:12:29] <ntcbow> did you paste that line 2 in the fiddle?
[16:12:59] <mysuper> it  gives error on html file above html tag
[16:13:22] <Caspan> I have a grid of divs... when i fade lets say 3 of them out i want to animate the rest of the divs as they move up to fill on the white space..
[16:13:32] <Caspan> see my site http://bbref.ca
[16:13:50] <Caspan> search for 99 you will see the results fade out then the divs just move...
[16:14:18] <Caspan> i want them to slide into their new place if possible... is this possible with jquery
[16:14:51] <kingplusplus> http://pastebin.com/dKcN2x4q please how do i get this to actually work? ….. jquery acts like a crap
[16:15:06] <kingplusplus> you check something on google paste it and it doesnt work http://pastebin.com/dKcN2x4q
[16:16:56] <mysuper> so anything??
[16:17:32] <kingplusplus> http://pastebin.com/dKcN2x4q please how do i get this to actually work? ….. jquery acts like a crap
[16:18:24] <kingplusplus> http://pastebin.com/dKcN2x4q please how do i get this to actually work? ….. jquery acts like a crap
[16:19:24] <Caspan> kingplusplus: i am doing a fiddle for you
[16:19:33] <ntcbow> mysuper http://jsfiddle.net/vvz0ck68/5/
[16:19:46] <ntcbow> you missed some parantheses..
[16:22:49] <kingplusplus> Caspan: ok waiting
[16:23:08] <mysuper> it still doesn works
[16:23:29] <mysuper> i work fot one input then again same error
[16:26:50] <Caspan> humm
[16:26:57] <Caspan> i cant get it to work either.. very simple..
[16:27:03] <Caspan> poking at it :)
[16:28:44] <bengalo> hey people, im writing a program that inserts metadata from an xls to pictures in a folder.. im not sure yet where my customly defined xmp is going to go yet. But later on this is supposed to have some kind of search function. so i checked spotlight importers. the doc said that i cannot have 2 importers for the same filetype (UTI). does that mean i cannot write a spotlight importer for my jpegs
[16:28:45] <bengalo> and such because i would have to entirely rewrite apples importer for those types?
[16:29:21] <bengalo> oops
[16:29:31] <bengalo> wrong chan
[16:29:33] <acidjazz> damn
[16:29:37] <acidjazz> insert that metadata
[16:29:38] <acidjazz> insert it
[16:29:42] <bengalo> i will
[16:29:45] <bengalo> thx for the help
[16:29:45] <acidjazz> shove it in there
[16:30:13] <ntcbow> mysuper: the only errors i get are 404's
[16:30:24] <acidjazz> ntcbow: its just missing then
[16:30:36] <acidjazz> you need an HTTPDetective
[16:30:39] <acidjazz> on the case
[16:31:56] <ntcbow> httpdetective sounds funny, like web seargant, or captain ajax
[16:32:53] <ntcbow> colonel kernel, with a big gun! that would help
[16:35:06] <Caspan> king
[16:35:10] <Caspan> kingplusplus: http://jsfiddle.net/yhx5quwv/1/
[16:35:33] <Caspan> i think it was because ou were missing a ; on the end of your .hide message
[16:35:49] <Caspan> i turned it into a class but you can turn it back to ID
[16:36:27] <kingplusplus> Caspan:  thanks  it worked
[16:36:39] <Caspan> then add more complexity to it
[16:36:50] <Caspan> the options in the Hide i ont think are right
[16:36:56] <Caspan> when i add them back it does not run
[16:39:05] <Caspan> okay now anyone know how i can get my Divs to slid into their new home
[16:39:15] <robertWorkBeer> what was the question?
[16:39:27] <Caspan> i have a row of 50 of them and i hide 5 of them i want the remaining ones to slide into their new homes
[16:39:45] <Caspan> robertWorkBeer: go to http://bbref.ca
[16:39:50] <Caspan> search for 99
[16:39:52] <robertWorkBeer> err...
[16:40:01] <robertWorkBeer> masonry
[16:40:08] <robertWorkBeer> or isotope
[16:40:28] <Caspan> is that jquery or a plugin
[16:41:18] <Caspan> was hoping there was something native in jquery if possible :)
[16:42:00] <robertWorkBeer> how are you hiding those divs?
[16:42:13] <robertWorkBeer> because isotope and masonry are build precisely to do things like this.
[16:42:36] <robertWorkBeer> and will give you exactly what you want.
[16:42:39] <Caspan> .fadeOut(1000)
[16:42:57] <Caspan> jquerry to do it on an onkeyup listener
[16:43:16] <Caspan> yeah... i like isotope
[16:43:22] <Caspan> kind of what i am looking for
[16:43:29] <robertWorkBeer> use that.
[16:43:37] <robertWorkBeer> otherwise, you're going to spend a lot of time rebuilding it.
[16:44:03] <Robdgreat> I want work beer
[16:44:14] <Caspan> i just thought there might be a built in option that when an object moves there is a way to slide it to its now position
[16:44:15] <robertWorkBeer> we have 53 new hires today.  the keg was crazy busy
[16:44:21] <Robdgreat> in truth, I could have brought beer to work and no one would be the weiser
[16:44:23] <robertWorkBeer> Caspan not like what you want.
[16:44:31] <Caspan> yeah.. thought soo
[16:44:33] <Caspan> than you
[16:44:36] <Caspan> thank
[16:45:02] <Caspan> i wan tto try to keep it simple using jsut native jquery but looks like i will need a plugin
[16:45:19] <Caspan> i like coding mystuff also... helps me learn :)
[16:45:41] <robertWorkBeer> then don't use jquery at all ;)
[16:48:59] <robertWorkBeer> Robdgreat we've done tastings at work a few times.
[16:49:34] <robertWorkBeer> and got to go to the sierra nevada barrel aging facility once and taste whatever we wanted.
[16:49:42] <ntcbwine> robertWorkBeer hehe us too
[16:49:56] * ntcbwine used to work in a brewery
[16:50:03] <robertWorkBeer> hah, that's cheating ;)
[16:50:46] <ntcbwine> barrel aging doesn't sound like beer
[16:51:02] <robertWorkBeer> it totally is.
[16:51:10] <robertWorkBeer> lots of companies are doing it now.
[16:51:15] <ntcbwine> more like "single malt" or so
[16:51:23] <robertWorkBeer> are you in the US?
[16:51:27] <ntcbwine> nope
[16:51:29] <robertWorkBeer> that's why.
[16:51:30] <ntcbwine> croatia
[16:51:50] <ntcbwine> the brewery thing was in germany thou
[16:51:57] <robertWorkBeer> yeah, in the US it's becoming pretty popular to take really big, powerful beers (like imperial stouts) and barrel age them.
[16:52:15] <ntcbwine> or really? for how long?
[16:52:16] <robertWorkBeer> in spent bourbon barrels, especially.  and german beers are mostly the styles you wouldn't age.  that's why,
[16:52:30] <robertWorkBeer> depending on the beer, 6 months to a year usually.
[16:52:37] <ntcbwine> wow
[16:52:42] <Robdgreat> robertWorkBeer: we used to have beer friday at a place a few jobs back
[16:52:43] <ntcbwine> and you tasted it?
[16:52:58] <ntcbwine> even more wow :)
[16:52:59] <robertWorkBeer> ntcbwine yep, both straight out of the barrel and I buy bottles of it.
[16:53:10] <ntcbwine> wowowow
[16:53:12] <robertWorkBeer> Robdgreat nice.  we do, too.
[16:53:15] <robertWorkBeer> totally awesome.
[16:53:35] <ntcbwine> i'd like a drop or two
[16:54:49] <ntcbwine> it's a shame that the germans don't experiment with their beer
[16:55:04] <robertWorkBeer> that's about to change.
[16:55:38] <ntcbwine> they just make the same old stuff over and over again, it's gets boring. and they're proud of that :(
[16:56:02] <robertWorkBeer> with stone building a brewery there that'll definitely change.
[16:56:27] <ntcbwine> stone building a brewery? what do you mean?
[16:56:45] <robertWorkBeer> stone is a brewery in the U.S. that's building a plant in berlin right now.
[16:57:02] <ntcbwine> ahh, heh i just got it ^^
[16:58:16] <ntcbwine> choices beyond the world of industrial beer!
[16:58:26] <ntcbwine> who would have thought of that
[16:58:49] <ntcbwine> americans coming to germany to show them how to do beer!
[16:59:16] <ntcbwine> i like that concept :p
[16:59:37] <robertWorkBeer> they used a forklift to destroy a bunch of german beer at the groundbreaking ceremony.
[17:00:02] <systemfault> American beer sucks... seriously.
[17:00:06] <robertWorkBeer> wat
[17:00:07] <systemfault> Even Canadian beer is better.
[17:00:07] <ntcbwine> hahaha
[17:00:21] <ntcbwine> german beer sucks too
[17:00:29] <robertWorkBeer> i've heard good things about canadian beer.
[17:00:33] <robertWorkBeer> i like lots of american beet.
[17:00:34] <robertWorkBeer> etc.
[17:00:36] <robertWorkBeer> *beer
[17:00:37] <systemfault> (Micro-breweries are exceptions :P)
[17:00:40] * ntcbwine is thinking of warsteiner and oettinger and ...
[17:00:49] <robertWorkBeer> and craft breweries.
[17:01:11] <ntcbwine> micro-breweries are the exceptions everywhere
[17:01:18] <robertWorkBeer> brb
[17:01:44] <ntcbwine> doing the micro thing big would be *the exception
[17:05:58] <ntcbwine> stone hires in more than 15 locations. that's impressive too. i wonder how many breweries they have.
[17:07:33] <ntcbwine> https://stonebrewing.atsondemand.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=512347.viewjobdetail&CID=512347&JID=484672
[17:07:35] <ntcbwine> ajj
[17:09:49] <ntcbwine> i wonder if i could get a h1b for that
[17:24:52] <Guest92958> .
[17:25:14] <Guest92958> #jquery?
[17:34:08] <xvicarious> Okay, is it possible to show a datepicker on a select tag/
[17:34:30] <robertWorkBeer> why would you do that?
[17:35:00] <xvicarious> Choose an option, such as "Specific Day", and up pops a datepicker.  Pick the day you want, and it fetches what you asked for.
[17:35:19] <robertWorkBeer> launch the select on the change of the select.
[17:35:22] <robertWorkBeer> have to do it manuall.
[17:35:24] <robertWorkBeer> *manually.
[17:35:53] <xvicarious> So I launch the datepicker on the select when I change it?
[17:36:09] <robertWorkBeer> on the change event, yeah.
[17:36:11] <robertWorkBeer> manually.
[17:36:22] <xvicarious> Like doing datepicker("show")?
[17:36:36] <robertWorkBeer> i don't rememner exactly how, but that's the basic idea.
[18:34:46] <Valduare> hi guys
[18:50:30] <Valduare> hows it going tonight
[19:02:03] <Sal> does anyone know why .click() doesn't work on <button> ?
[19:02:38] <Sal> does it only accept .on() ?
[19:03:00] <Valduare> not sure
[19:06:04] <Sal> anyway, whats the correct syntax for listening to a click event on class .myBtn ?
[19:06:09] <shoky> Sal: it works fine on buttons. .click() is just a shortcut to .on()
[19:06:36] <Sal> i'm trying $('.myBtn').on('click', myFunc);
[19:06:54] <shoky> should work fine if the element is already in the DOM when you call that
[19:06:54] <Sal> shoky, its not working
[19:07:09] <Sal> let me try jsfiddle
[19:07:12] <shoky> if it's not in the DOM yet, you may want to try event delegation
[19:07:19] <shoky> see docs for .on about that
[19:07:42] <Sal> it is in the DOM
[19:07:50] <Sal> and i set it up on document.ready
[19:08:23] <Sal> its a normal click on the toolbar hambuger icon
[19:08:25] <shoky> k, make a fiddle
[19:11:03] <Sal> look: http://jsfiddle.net/0pkjawse/
[19:11:46] <Sal> did i make any mistake writing code?
[19:12:36] <shoky> Sal: it works if you include jquery
[19:12:38] <Sal> oh, wait
[19:12:40] <Sal> it works now
[19:12:45] <Sal> i forgot to include jquery
[19:12:50] <Sal> yes
[19:13:07] <Sal> damn
[19:13:12] <Sal> let me check again my code
[19:13:27] <Sal> anyway, whats the correct syntax for using on() ?
[19:13:38] <shoky> `api on
[19:13:39] <b-ot> shoky: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:13:51] <shoky> see the docs for examples
[19:13:56] <Sal> i did
[19:14:05] <Sal> and wasn't able to put it on
[19:14:10] <shoky> .on('click', function() { .. })
[19:14:14] <Sal> do i have to add () after my function name?
[19:14:48] <Sal> no, i don't use inline functions, i prefer separate funtions
[19:14:53] <Sal> so i was doing
[19:15:03] <Sal> .on('click', myfunc());
[19:15:18] <Sal> is that correct?
[19:15:19] <BillCriswell> Sal: No ()
[19:15:24] <BillCriswell> Just myfun
[19:15:25] <Sal> damn
[19:15:31] <Sal> i get error without it
[19:15:39] <Sal> ok, let me check it
[19:15:41] <Sal> thanks
[19:15:41] <BillCriswell> Unless myfunc() RETURNS a function.
[19:15:49] <BillCriswell> but I doubt that's the case.
[19:17:18] <Sal> look here please: http://i.imgur.com/7JvWuGN.png
[19:17:24] <Sal> thats what i get
[19:18:55] <Sal> whats that error for?
[19:19:00] <Sal> the function is right under
[19:20:21] <BillCriswell> Sal: The [0] is giving you access to the node, not the jQuery version of it.
[19:20:43] <BillCriswell> Get rid of the [0] and you should be good.
[19:21:02] <Sal> but i need to add the event only to the first element
[19:21:19] <Sal> i mean, if users adds more than one, i should only do it got yjr first
[19:21:25] <Sal> how can i do that then?
[19:21:28] <BillCriswell> You're using an ID, which should be absolutely unique.
[19:22:03] <Sal> ok
[19:22:39] <BillCriswell> If you want jquery access to the first element in a collection though you can use .first() or .eq(0)
[19:23:30] <Sal> ok
[19:23:47] <Sal> could that be the reason why click() wasn't working?
[19:25:07] <BillCriswell> You meant on the btnNav.on('click', ...) line?
[19:25:42] <Sal> yes
[19:25:58] <BillCriswell> Because btnNav wasn't a jQuery onject.
[19:26:01] <Sal> anyway, it doesn't matter
[19:26:02] <BillCriswell> object*
[19:26:05] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[19:26:10] <Sal> i'm trying it withou the array index
[19:26:11] <Sal> thanks
[19:26:20] <Sal> thanks
[19:27:43] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[20:18:37] <Valduare> dead channel tonight
[20:20:29] <BillCriswell> Yeah it is.
[20:20:45] <Valduare> im trying to learn how to do hidden elements and update them
[20:20:49] <Valduare> hidden input
[20:21:08] <Valduare> I have a dropdown menu with bootstrap   and need it to update the value of a hidden input
[20:21:49] <Valduare> think you could help with that BillCriswell ?
[20:22:44] <BillCriswell> Valduare: Yes.
[20:22:54] <Valduare> ty
[20:22:58] <Valduare> let me get you a fiddle
[20:23:19] <Valduare> http://jsfiddle.net/42Lqvcqu/1/
[20:24:04] <Valduare> just added the hidden input in there
[20:30:51] <Valduare> BillCriswell: its been real tough trying to find out how to do this online - cant find any reputable information
[20:30:57] <BillCriswell> Valduare: the dropdown doesn't really seem meant for this exactly, but it's possible.
[20:31:33] <delinquentme> http://jsfiddle.net/cmhd8ods/1/  " undefined is not a function "
[20:31:35] <Valduare> the nice thing is its cross platform unlike select elements
[20:31:35] <delinquentme> why is this ?
[20:34:45] <tw2113> delinquentme, try $(this)
[20:40:21] <BillCriswell> Valduare: You have two elements with the sme ID.
[20:40:42] <Valduare> BillCriswell: ya I forgot to remove the id / name from the button after I added the hidden input for the jsfiddle for you
[20:41:35] <BillCriswell> Valduare: http://jsfiddle.net/42Lqvcqu/3/ are you essentially trying to do something like this?
[20:45:37] <Valduare> so if I jsut convert that over from id=hidden to type=hidden and little bit more modification when I select something with the dropdown butotn it will edit the value of that hidden input
[20:45:41] <Valduare> that looks about right
[20:46:11] <BillCriswell> Ye.
[20:46:25] <BillCriswell> I changed the id to "hidden" cause "so" was taken already.
[20:46:31] <BillCriswell> Headed out. Night!
[20:47:06] <Valduare> ty
[22:01:52] <jzp113> hi
[22:02:47] <jzp113> https://bpaste.net/show/a4dc4ab89bf6 why it's see doesn't work?
[22:13:31] <shoky> jzp113  works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/sjbxwdhw/
[22:15:59] <jzp113> real?
[22:17:00] <shoky> real. shi
[22:17:38] <jzp113> i cann't open the url
[22:18:04] <shoky> use a proxy
[22:18:52] <shoky> anyway i just used your code, added a <button> though. maybe you dont have a button in the dom on load
[22:21:35] <jzp113> yes the website look well good
[22:22:11] <jzp113> so clearly
[22:23:20] <shoky> can't help without seeing the problem. did you check your js console
[22:23:45] <jzp113> ok I show full code for you
[22:27:19] <jzp113> https://bpaste.net/show/216a0bee6ece
[22:27:48] <jzp113> shoky, it's see doesn't show the hide
[22:29:01] <shoky> jzp113  what's the problem exactly?  your button is a form submit button. do you want the form to be submitted ?
[22:29:40] <jzp113> yes
[22:29:59] <jzp113> I want to hide the form and show the h1
[22:30:29] <shoky> form submit would reload the page, losing any changes you made like hiding and showing...
[22:31:42] <shoky> so it's probably doing the .hide and .show but reloading the page right away so you don't see it
[22:31:57] <shoky> maybe you want to do an ajax submit instead
[22:32:45] <jzp113> yes but  when I click the submit then will hide the form value . why
[22:32:51] <shoky> btw you're doing $("h.hide")  but it has  id=hide  not class=hide
[22:33:01] <shoky> for id you need $("#hide")
[22:33:34] <shoky> because it submits the form, which causes the page to reload.
[22:33:42] <shoky> that's what a form submit does
[22:34:49] <jzp113> No I just want to show some words to user when I loading the page
[22:35:00] <shoky> you said you wanted to submit the form
[22:35:36] <shoky> if you want to submit it without loading a fresh page.. you might want to learn about ajax form submits
[22:35:37] <dismist> So I parallel double-parked that mother fucker sideways
[22:36:43] <jzp113> ok  thanks
[22:49:17] <jzp113> shoky Only the ajax way can solve it?
[22:50:03] <shoky> jzp113 you can also submit it normally and then render updated html in response, from your server
[22:50:36] <shoky> though you can't animate the changes this way. only with ajax you can submit data to server without a page refresh
[22:55:07] <jzp113> But it's not my purpose .you know when you binding something  it's need some time to check you username and password .so I need some like a word or gif to make user fell better when checking the imformation
[22:55:31] <jzp113> shoky, but I don't know how to do it
[22:57:14] <shoky> $.ajax for sending data.  you already know how to hide/show stuff.. you'll need to ask a more specific question :P

[23:42:20] <gtristan> Hi, if I understand correctly, jquery's event propagation (like .trigger() and .on() etc) is what does some kind of custom 'bubbleing' of events upwards through the DOM tree, is that correct or is that a feature of the DOM itself ?
[23:43:23] <gtristan> more specifically, how do I prevent further propagation of an event up the tree, i.e. to indicate that 'the event was handled, please dont let a parent handle it again' ?
[23:46:58] <gtristan> ah, I see I'm mistaken, bubbling is an attribute of the DOM, not jquery
[23:48:23] <gtristan> so it seems that event.stopPropagation() is what stops it from going further... and jquery event handlers are documented to do that automatically in a browser compatible way, simply by returning 'false' from the handler
