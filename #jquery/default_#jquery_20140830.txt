[04:51:22] <uskerine> hi, what does this selector do? jQuery('span', $('#uniform-You_id_checkbox')).removeClass("checked");
[04:53:11] <uskerine> does 'span' apply to all span's in the DOM?
[04:55:20] <zalatovo> It's equivalent to $('#uniform-You_id_checkbox').find('span').removeClass("checked");
[04:56:05] <zalatovo> @ uskerine
[04:56:33] <uskerine> what does find('span') do?
[04:57:03] <uskerine> I can guess for the context that it is trying to find a parent 'span' but I just don't know the syntax

[05:42:53] <rudeboy_> I have a dynamic populated list through jQuery, which inserts a blank <option> on first load and then "loading" text with each time it populates.

Can anyone possibly help? http://paste.ofcode.org/PPKY6itTJUwiDLYsRV9ERP

[06:25:14] <afidegnum> hello good morning all,
[06:25:22] <afidegnum> anyone online?
[06:26:55] <afidegnum> looking at this page http://www.illuztrate.com/steps/step-step-ubuntu-installation
[06:29:08] <afidegnum> how do I automatically close reply link?

[06:44:29] <Snoopal> hey guys. is there a way to react with jquery as soon as an element gets a specific class?
[06:45:26] <Snoopal> eg. another script adds the class ".processing" to an element and i want to do something as soon as this element has .processing
[06:46:18] <dznkty> Snoopal: set up a listener?
[06:46:43] <t432> how do you check if an elemt has data with specific name? e.g. see if foo has data called boo
[06:47:01] <dznkty> $(‘foo[data=“boo”]’)
[06:47:13] <dznkty> there’s also hasData()
[06:47:26] <dznkty> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.hasdata/
[06:47:29] <t432> hasData seems not work
[06:47:30] <roowilliams> quick Q... is if(a>b && x<y || a>b && x>y) fine? as in.. can i have that many logical operators?
[06:48:02] <t432> e,e,g this return undefined $(event.target)hasData('boo')
[06:48:13] <t432> $(event.target).hasData('boo')
[06:48:55] <t432> i'm using it correctly?
[06:50:02] <dznkty> hasData() works when you use .data()
[06:50:04] <Snoopal> dznkty could you could give me a little hint to "set up a listenere" ? :)
[06:50:30] <t432> dznkty: can you give me an example?
[06:51:06] <t432> so data='foo' will work and data-moo='goo' will fail?
[06:51:07] <Snoopal> or do you mean something like $('foo').bind('change',function() { $(this).hasClass('processing'); }); ?
[06:51:10] <dznkty> $(‘.foo’).data(‘bar’); if ($(‘.foo’).hasData(‘bar’)) { .. }
[06:51:22] <dznkty> Snoopal: change is typically for form elements
[06:51:42] <Snoopal> hmm
[06:51:42] <dznkty> if you want to listen for a class being added, you can bind a DomSubtreeModified action  instead of change
[06:51:45] <dznkty> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9488653/jquery-how-to-listen-for-dom-changes
[06:52:04] <Snoopal> thanks
[06:52:35] <dznkty> then you can use hasClass()
[06:52:52] <Snoopal> understood. thank you very much :)
[06:52:58] <dznkty> np =) glad to help!
[06:54:40] <afidegnum> hi, here, the reply form "reply"   display the comment form by default,   how do I set it to automatically hide? here is the url below the page. http://www.illuztrate.com/steps/step-step-ubuntu-installation
[06:55:09] <afidegnum> it doesn't look nice for each thread to have reply form opened like that.
[06:55:43] <dznkty> .comment-form { display: none } in the css
[06:55:57] <dznkty> or on.ready() you can do $(‘.comment-form’).hide();
[06:56:21] <dznkty> one or other btw, doing both is redundant
[06:56:57] * dznkty is away for a few minutes
[06:57:22] <afidegnum> dznkty: If I set display to none, I beleive the link won't show at all?
[07:03:56] <p0wr> i = i|0;
[07:03:58] <p0wr> why is this used ?
[07:06:14] <phx> p0wr, if i is null, then it'll be 0
[07:06:34] <phx> but shouldn't that be ||? (logical OR instead of bitwise)

[07:08:29] <sokie> can anyone help me with this. cycle is running in firefox, yet not in any other of the browsers like IE.Opera etc. http://vom-goldenen-kleeblatt.de/wb/index.php/webcam the images on top should cycle
[07:10:21] <shoky> |0 truncates/converts to an int
[07:11:00] <afidegnum> hi, any answer to my question?
[07:19:00] <sokie> anyone got an idea why my cycle would run in Firefox just fine and doesnt in chrome, IE, Opera etc? http://vom-goldenen-kleeblatt.de/wb/ ?
[07:20:33] <shoky> sokie: look in chrome's console and you'll see  Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[07:22:08] <shoky> sokie: don't use stuff directly from github. or use rawgit.com  domain instead
[07:22:20] <shoky> sokie: e.g.  https://rawgit.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js
[07:22:41] <sokie> oh, that is great (i just dont have chrome on my machine, that's why i couldnt look that up) i guess i need to host that library on my own site, right? (because i cant change how they provide it)
[07:22:52] <shoky> yeah that would fix it
[07:23:11] <sokie> oh, thanks a lot, i wouldnt have thought it would be that simple
[07:27:54] <sokie> snoky, if i wanted to get it from rawgit.com, how do i get the correct URL?
[07:28:29] <shoky> sokie: you just replace the hostname with rawgit.com like i did ;p
[07:28:53] <shoky> sokie: but that's not recommended for production sites.. only while developing maybe
[07:30:00] <sokie> oic. yeah, there are still issues to fix, and thanks, i just replaced the raw.githubusers... part with rawgit.com, and it works for the time being
[07:30:16] <sokie> i will host the lib on my site later
[07:31:02] <sokie> ty, shoky:)
[07:56:57] <dznkty> sokie:  they are cycling for me in chrome
[08:01:43] <sokie> dznkty, meanwhile they do. i took shoky's advice
[08:02:00] <sokie> thanks for checking:)
[08:02:26] <dznkty> sokie: yeah my bad I had too much scrollback and I didn’t realize it was an old message haha
[08:02:52] <sokie> :)
[08:52:37] <Technodrome> for like any transition, we should be using css transitions correct?

[09:41:49] <frank_o> banister: if its similar to jquery ui's popup there's some trickery involved if you want scroll bars: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14723788/jquery-mobile-popup-content-height-exceeds-window-height
[09:43:23] <banister> frank_o hmm ok, right now i'm just trying to constrain the size -- does this look like it should work? (it doesnt) https://gist.github.com/143f4e3ef3fa574dc66b

[11:13:09] <NinjaBanjo> eddie_v89, in your .on your passing event is as e. but calling preventDefault on event
[11:14:58] <eddie_v89> NinjaBanjo: yes.. badtype in fiddle.. but is not the issue
[11:47:46] <MACscr> why would var domain = $(this).('#domain').val();
[11:47:57] <MACscr> trigger an unexpected token error in console?
[11:48:23] <decx> because it's wrong
[11:49:02] <decx> decide if you want this, or #domain
[11:49:06] <decx> -,
[11:51:11] <MACscr> lol, that would make sense
[11:51:27] <basiclases> how do i serialize json with vanilla js guys?
[11:51:44] <MACscr> wouldnt you ask than in #javascript then? =P
[11:52:37] <basiclases> MACscr: thats not how it went down man
[11:56:44] <MACscr> lol, that response doesnt make sense or relate to what I just asked

[12:50:35] <coxaLT> And attrivute of what page ajax.php should load
[12:51:52] <coxaLT> Inside onShow i would like to retrieve link's data-ajaxLoad attribute. but because access of attribute is inside function and out of scope i cannot reach it
[12:52:10] <motaka2> in this page when I type the latter "a" in the input infront of HOTEL_NAME, I get the result set aligned in somewhere strange, how can I align the result set according to the center of that input? http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[12:53:02] <coxaLT> I am new in jquery, so i dont know how could access $(this).attr('data-ajaxLoad') in function wich is on next scope
[12:53:11] <coxaLT> Please help me
[13:07:37] <Jagst3r21> any idea why i cant get this modal to close? http://scholarships360.wpstagecoach.com/
[13:07:43] <Jagst3r21> using this pen..http://codepen.io/anon/pen/puxJF
[13:09:52] <Woet> Jagst3r21: in the pen because you have "pointer-events: none;"
[13:10:03] <Jagst3r21> woops
[13:10:04] <Woet> and on your site, I assume because the button doesn't have an ID
[13:10:16] <Jagst3r21> oh shoot
[13:10:18] <Jagst3r21> :/
[13:13:20] <coxaLT> Woet could you help me
[13:13:20] <coxaLT> ?
[13:18:55] <MACscr> coxaLT: you have to show jsfiddle example for help

[13:20:25] <coxaLT> http://jsfiddle.net/jnzwjv0k/
[13:20:52] <coxaLT> My question would be probably simple
[13:21:15] <coxaLT> How to pass onShow: function(this){
[13:21:15] <MACscr> that is not a testable example
[13:21:26] <coxaLT> Its just syntax
[13:21:30] <coxaLT> question
[13:22:21] <coxaLT> how to pass  onShow: function(this){
[13:22:39] <coxaLT> so i could access it in  var content = $(this).attr('data-ajaxLoad') + 'x';
[13:22:59] <coxaLT> because now i get dialog where content says "undefined"
[13:23:38] <coxaLT> i dont know how to pass $(this).attr to another scope
[13:23:40] <coxaLT> :/
[13:23:58] <laravelnewbie> hi all
[13:24:56] <laravelnewbie> can someone tell me what is this trick that show the last "option" column on hover plz http://codecanyon.net/item/xcrud-data-management-system-php-crud/full_screen_preview/3215400
[13:26:02] <MACscr> last option?
[13:26:14] <coxaLT> Macscr, so could you help me?
[13:26:27] <MACscr> coxaLT: nope. already told you why
[13:27:01] <MACscr> laravelnewbie: im not sure what last "option" you are talking about
[13:28:15] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:hi and thanks for taking time to help, in fact my question is , as you see in the link i've provided, when you hover over a row, a link apear with 3 btn for show / edit and delete
[13:28:59] <MACscr> appear? its already there
[13:29:00] <laravelnewbie> i need to provide that kind of trick to my users as i have a large table that the user need to scroll horizontally to see its content, but i want to provide to the users the options to show on hover
[13:29:20] <coxaLT> Macsrc, i am new in jquery. Dont know how code jquery
[13:29:59] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:i know it's already there, i have same column with options, i need to hide it and only show its options on hover
[13:30:07] <coxaLT> Just asking how to pass variable onShow: function($(this)){ alert($(this)); }
[13:30:23] <coxaLT> Now it's not workingh
[13:30:42] <laravelnewbie> i dont know how to do that kind of trick, i dont even know what to type on google to find a tutorial for showing the last column content
[13:31:12] <MACscr> laravelnewbie: what do you want to hover over for it to show?
[13:32:09] <MACscr> also, all the links show by default on that example, so your example is confusing to me as i dont think it shows what you WANT to do
[13:32:19] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:the rows, i need to show the option on hovering over rows like in the link
[13:32:32] <MACscr> as it doesnt hide/show anything on hover besides changing the background colors
[13:32:59] <laravelnewbie> oh, maybe you have a large screen ? could you resize your window so you see what i mean , maybe ?
[13:33:02] <basiclases> hey guys, how would you take an object, and select certain key:value pairs and put them into a new object?
[13:33:15] <MACscr> yes, i do 1080
[13:33:22] <MACscr> i resized and no difference
[13:33:45] <laravelnewbie> give me a sec i'll take a screenshot and show you
[13:35:28] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:http://img1.imagilive.com/affiche/0814/test.JPG.htm
[13:36:04] <MACscr> laravelnewbie: what browser?
[13:36:08] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:see those 3 buttons ? they only show on hover over a row to provide option to take on that specific row
[13:36:12] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:chrome
[13:36:20] <coxaLT> is there another dimension where people would be helpful and could help with simple things and jquery?
[13:36:23] <MACscr> odd, im not seeing it on chrome my osx box
[13:36:45] <coxaLT> And would not require working jsfiddle example from begginers?
[13:36:48] <MACscr> anyway, thats just a simple hover and show function
[13:37:01] <MACscr> coxaLT: sure. Hire someone
[13:37:21] <coxaLT> How much did you donate in last year?
[13:37:36] <coxaLT> Or are you contributing in projects somewhere?
[13:37:57] <MACscr> ive been contributing to open source projects for about 15 years now
[13:38:50] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:that mean store the last <td> and show hide it ?
[13:39:12] <coxaLT> Sounds nice that you were contributing for last 15 years (Really!), But now you cant contribute 2 minutes and tell how in the world could i pass $(this) variable to another function scope
[13:39:59] <adam_293> whats the difference between $(document).on("click", "ul.pagination li a", function(e){})  and $("ul.pagination li a").on("click", function(event){})
[13:40:00] <coxaLT> I am already spending last two or three hours on this "simple", "basic thing" to look on internet and find solution, maybe i don't get somethingf
[13:40:54] <MACscr> laravelnewbie: might be a bit more difficult than that if you want more control over where it shows up. If you just want it to popup on the end and not hover over anything else, then yes, its that simple
[13:42:51] <laravelnewbie> MACscr:could you tell me what is the name of that trick as i have no idee what to type in google to get some tutorial
[13:42:54] <laravelnewbie> +s
[13:47:02] <MACscr> laravelnewbie: trick? its just mouseover() and show()/hide()
[13:47:24] <MACscr> specifically check out http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[13:48:03] <MACscr> there is obviously http://api.jquery.com/hover/ as well
[13:52:11] <Jagst3r21> any idea how i can get the modal to fade in? http://scholarships360.wpstagecoach.com/news/

[16:38:40] * tw2113 golf claps
[16:39:28] * Velveeta tears the collar off and tosses the skull over one shoulder, saying "wtf am i doing? i hate shakespeare"
[16:40:43] <banister> how do i scroll to the bottom of a div?
[16:41:13] <Velveeta> banister: you'll want to set the scrollTop value
[16:41:23] <banister> Velveeta to what?
[16:42:02] <Velveeta> off the top of my head, and this may be incorrect, you'd want something like var div = $('#yourDiv'); div.scrollTop(div[0].scrollHeight - div[0].clientHeight])
[16:42:12] <Velveeta> something like that
[16:43:38] <ychaouche> was there a change in the prepend familiy functions since 2011 ? SO answers say that element1.prepend(element2) will return element2. In my code it always returns element1.
[16:43:59] <Velveeta> as far as i know, that SO answer is incorrect
[16:44:10] <Velveeta> prepend/append/etc should always return the originating element
[16:45:21] <ychaouche> Velveeta: is there a way to chain appends together though, maybe with other method calls ? (like append a to span, which is appended to p which is appended to div).
[16:46:08] <banister> Velveeta thx, i just used scrollHeight not clientHeight, what's clientHeight about?
[16:46:49] <Velveeta> not in an elegant way like i think you may be hoping for.. you'd have to do something like this: $('div').append($('p').append($('span').append(element))) ... assuming each of those selectors just returned the 1 element you were targeting
[16:47:30] <ychaouche> Velveeta: oh no, I am creating all of the elements, they do not exist.
[16:47:47] <Velveeta> banister: clientHeight will return the height of the div itself... if your div is say, 100px tall, and scrollable, with 500px of scrollHeight inside of it, you only need to set the scrollTop to 400, the scrollHeight minus the clientHeight
[16:49:25] <Velveeta> ychaouche: if you're creating them all dynamically, then it would be equally as ugly, something like this: $('<div>This is my new div</div>').append($('<p>This is my new p</p>').append($('<span>This is my new span</span>').append('<span>Some other content</span>'))))
[16:49:47] <Velveeta> the proper way to do that would be to break them apart into separate statements for readability, because you're really not gaining anything by chaining them like that
[16:50:01] <Velveeta> but, since you asked if there was a way to chain them, yes, there is, it's just ugly ^^ like that
[16:51:19] <ychaouche> In fact here's my code : https://gist.github.com/ychaouche/1c37c163443e2dd90bc7
[16:51:24] <ychaouche> doesn't work.
[16:51:39] <ychaouche> I'll try with append.
[16:52:18] <Velveeta> $(img).appendTo(a).appendTo(span).appendTo(div); is returning the img over and over
[16:52:29] <Velveeta> each of those function calls in that chain will return your img element, not the next element in the chain
[16:52:30] <ychaouche> exactly
[16:52:44] <ychaouche> so append is different ?
[16:52:58] <Velveeta> no, you're missing something when you read mine
[16:53:01] <Velveeta> all of those calls are nested
[16:53:09] <Velveeta> the equivalent in this case would be something like this:
[16:53:25] <Velveeta> img.appendTo(a.appendTo(span.appendTo(div)))
[16:53:40] <ychaouche> oooooohhh
[16:54:09] <ychaouche> then I don't understand your previous suggestion about $('<div>This is my new div</div>').append($('<p>This is my new p</p>').append($('<span>This is my new span</span>').append('<span>Some other content</span>'))))
[16:54:16] <ychaouche> how would that work ?
[16:54:18] <Velveeta> also, i'm not sure if this line will do what you want it to do, but i might be wrong: var span  = $("<span/>",{ addClass:'x'}); ... i think that should be this instead: var span  = $("<span/>",{ 'class':'x'});
[16:54:45] <Velveeta> if you look at each of those steps, they don't close out their final parens until the very end
[16:54:49] <ychaouche> because class is a reserved javascript keyword ?
[16:55:00] <Velveeta> only if you try to use it as a property name without quotes
[16:55:09] <Velveeta> then it'll throw an error
[16:55:14] <Velveeta> does addClass work in that statement?
[16:55:25] <ychaouche> yes, I was already caught with that.
[16:55:46] <Velveeta> you can use class like that if it's quoted as a string, but not unquoted
[16:55:53] <ychaouche> ok
[16:56:01] <Velveeta> so as for that previous line, i'll break it up some to make it more readable
[16:56:33] <ychaouche> I still don't understand the parens thing though, all the parens are closed in your first example, but there are still )))) at the end.
[16:56:39] <Velveeta> $('<div>This is my new div</div>').append( $('<p>This is my new p</p>').append( $('<span>This is my new span</span>').append('<span>Some other content</span>') ) )
[16:56:42] <ychaouche> They don't seem to match any open parens
[16:56:50] <Velveeta> the final parens of each step doesn't close until the very end
[16:57:00] <Velveeta> $('<div>This is my new div</div>').append( $('<p>This is my new p</p>').append
[16:57:17] <Velveeta> like in this case, we're appending the $('<p>stuff').append
[16:57:25] <Velveeta> not $('<p>stuff')).append
[16:57:26] <ychaouche> oh two parens right
[16:57:48] <Velveeta> so each of those is a nested call which doesn't close itself out until the very end of that chain so that it works from the inside out
[16:58:01] <Velveeta> but as you just demonstrated, it's a real pain in the ass to actually read, so it's terrible for maintainbility
[16:58:11] <ychaouche> ok I didn't see the nesting
[16:58:15] <ychaouche> now it's all clear
[16:58:19] <Velveeta> when soemone revisits that in 6m to 1y (probably you), you won't be able to understand wtf you were doing :)
[16:58:39] <Velveeta> which is why it's better, for readaibility's sake, to break that up into separate lines for explicitness
[16:59:00] <ychaouche> by the way the addClass thing works because I can see the images with class="X" on them in firebug.
[16:59:10] <Velveeta> ok, so then i just learned something new
[16:59:38] <Velveeta> i knew you could do things like mouseover: inline like that and it would attach those handlers, but i didn't know you could call any arbitrary $.fn function inline like that
[17:00:20] <ychaouche> sorry which part is that ?
[17:01:23] <Velveeta> just like you did $(selector, { addClass: 'x' }) you can also do $(selector, { mouseenter: callback })
[17:01:37] <Velveeta> so apparently jquery just supports calling any function from the $.fn namespace as part of that object map
[17:02:03] <Velveeta> so you should (in theory) also be able to do something like this: $(selector, { remove: undefined }) and create and remove the element in one fell swoop
[17:02:12] <Velveeta> because remove() exists in the $.fn namespace
[17:02:18] <Velveeta> i'll go test that real quick
[17:02:21] <ychaouche> Oh I don't know, I didn't try that yet :) that was some wishful coding.
[17:02:31] <ychaouche> I hope it works.
[17:03:42] <Velveeta> interesting, when i go to jquery.com (just to make sure jquery is loaded in the page) and open my console and enter this, i get false: $('<a>test</a>', { addClass: 'x' }).hasClass('x')
[17:04:13] <Velveeta> although when i do this i also get false: $('<a>test</a>', { 'class': 'x' }).hasClass('x')
[17:04:23] <Velveeta> so i have to be screwing something up
[17:06:13] <ychaouche> I don't know, I can see the class though in my case. Let me put it live for you.
[17:06:40] <Velveeta> yeah, i don't see why it's not working with an anchor tag, but it works for a div, so i'll play with a div instead
[17:07:55] <ychaouche> woops
[17:08:05] <ychaouche> my content extends 16Kb and cannot be hosted free
[17:08:09] <ychaouche> on http://www.webdevout.net/test
[17:08:26] <ychaouche> I should try jsfiddle then
[17:08:36] <Velveeta> yeah i was about to recommend jsfiddle
[17:09:35] <Velveeta> ok, apparently it just doesn't like assigning those inline options when you supply some innerHTML kind of content, so <div>test</div> doesn't work with the 2nd parameter, but <div></div> does
[17:09:45] <Velveeta> and same with an anchor
[17:10:04] <Velveeta> so this works: $( "<a></a>", { addClass: 'x' }).hasClass('x')
[17:11:11] <ychaouche> my code doesn't run in jsfiddle :(
[17:11:25] <ychaouche> I think it hates when I put javascript inside the HTML pane
[17:11:52] <Velveeta> this throws a TypeError for illegal invocation :D $( "<a></a>", { each: alert })
[17:12:01] <Velveeta> so put your js in the js pane?
[17:12:45] <ychaouche> I did
[17:12:53] <ychaouche> still doesn't work as expected
[17:12:57] <ychaouche> I must be screwing somethig
[17:13:03] <ychaouche> it worked right in webdevout
[17:14:21] <Velveeta> what's the url?
[17:14:59] <ychaouche> O there's an error in the console : jQuery is not defined
[17:15:05] <ychaouche> I should include jQuery first I guess
[17:15:08] <ychaouche> in order
[17:16:18] <ychaouche> wait, how am I suppose to add jQuery ? should I copy/paste all of jQuery's code into jsfiddle ?
[17:16:28] <ychaouche> here's the url : http://jsfiddle.net/ou4drw2t/2/
[17:16:47] <ychaouche> oh on the left
[17:16:50] <ychaouche> ok
[17:17:15] <ychaouche> that's good, no errors, but still no working code :)
[17:18:57] <ychaouche> O, right, I forgot to put the javascript code that was in body in the js pane.
[17:19:16] <Velveeta> so, you're not appending the ul anywhere
[17:20:00] <ychaouche> ah that's better : http://jsfiddle.net/ou4drw2t/5/
[17:20:03] <ychaouche> now it woks
[17:20:05] <Velveeta> i see you appending the img to the a to the span to the div, and then you're putting the ul after the div, but nothing ever actually being appended to the document
[17:20:05] <ychaouche> works
[17:20:13] <Velveeta> ahh, there we go
[17:20:58] <ychaouche> there should be a url to the results pane, right ?
[17:21:15] <ychaouche> share fullscreen result
[17:21:21] <ychaouche> http://jsfiddle.net/ou4drw2t/5/embedded/result/
[17:21:32] <Velveeta> i see a whole bunch of content blocks
[17:22:01] <ychaouche> yes, if you hover the top right corner, there's a hidden image there
[17:22:18] <ychaouche> you can inspect it and see that class='imgX' has been set
[17:22:37] <ychaouche> unfortunately though, the mouseover thing to show it doesn't work. Yet.
[17:22:47] <Velveeta> and just to simplify this in the future, when you have entire js files worth of stuff that you want to include in your fiddles, like "FeedEk jQuery RSS/ATOM Feed Plugin v2.0", you can add those via the External Resources link in the left nav
[17:23:01] <ychaouche> oh nice
[17:23:03] <ychaouche> ok
[17:23:11] <Velveeta> if it's the img you're creating dynamically, it's because you're using a relative path for its src
[17:23:19] <Velveeta> in fiddle, you'll have to specify its absolute path
[17:23:37] <ychaouche> no no
[17:23:43] <ychaouche> it's hidden
[17:23:49] <ychaouche> and of course it's in the local disk
[17:23:57] <ychaouche> so it shouldn't appear anyways
[17:24:04] <ychaouche> but at least a borken image logo should appear
[17:24:07] <Velveeta> gotcha
[17:24:08] <ychaouche> or shouldn't it ?
[17:24:20] <ychaouche> :)
[17:24:42] <Velveeta> good question, i'm not sure if chrome (what i'm using currently) displays broken image links, but it's been a while since i had to deal with them
[17:35:40] <ychaouche> hmm
[17:35:57] <ychaouche> imgId is defined as var imgId in a function, and is accessed inside mouseover
[17:36:06] <ychaouche> as $(imgId)
[17:36:20] <ychaouche> would the inner function get access to imgId of the outer function ?
[17:37:01] <ychaouche> https://gist.github.com/ychaouche/329c31643009020dc47b
[17:37:27] <Velveeta> yep, it's called a closure scope
[17:37:35] <ychaouche> mm k
[17:41:30] <ychaouche> Aha it works now :)
[17:41:51] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[17:42:35] <ychaouche> but onmouseenter and onmouseleave would be better than over/out
[17:50:05] <ychaouche> will fadeOut() remove elements or just hide them ?
[17:50:40] <ychaouche> mm display:None
[17:56:26] <ychaouche> grr
[17:56:54] <ychaouche> I want to fadeout then remove, but I want to delay the remove so that fadeout is visible
[17:57:00] <ychaouche>     a.click(function(){var parent = $(this).parent().parent(); parent.fadeOut().delay(2500).remove(); });
[17:57:02] <ychaouche> didn't work
[17:57:11] <ychaouche> parent is removed right over
[17:59:07] <ychaouche> oh delay works only for fx functions
[17:59:14] <ychaouche> I have to put remove in the fx queue it seems
[18:00:58] <systemfault> 1) don't use .parent().parent(), it's bad code... 2) You can use the promise that delay returns to remove the element
[18:04:09] <ychaouche> systemfault: delay returns instantly, it doesn't wait to execute the remove.
[18:06:19] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/f41u40xj/
[18:06:25] <systemfault> ychaouche ^
[18:07:06] <ychaouche> oh "promise" :)
[18:07:14] <ychaouche> I didn't know that was a function.
[18:07:47] <systemfault> And instead of .parent().parent(), use .closest(selector)
[18:08:33] <ychaouche> will closest also look in siblings when it goes up the hierarchy ?
[18:08:47] <Velveeta> nope, but neither will parent().parent()
[18:09:17] <ychaouche> that's why I was asking, I don't want to remove a sibling with the same selector
[18:09:25] <ychaouche> ok it's safe to use then
[18:09:29] <Velveeta> yepyep
[18:09:38] <Velveeta> closest will search from the current element up through its parents
[18:11:04] <ychaouche> works fine for me
[18:13:43] <ychaouche> also promise.then works good
[18:13:46] <ychaouche> thanks a lot systemfault
[18:13:52] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[18:22:11] <ychaouche> Now it's more like it http://jsfiddle.net/ou4drw2t/8/embedded/result/
[18:22:56] <systemfault> Cool
[18:26:28] <Velveeta> das a lot of news
[18:27:09] <ychaouche> that's why I called it newsr00m
[18:27:53] <ychaouche> the ticking boxes were the only feature of hackurls.com that I missed.
[18:28:07] <ychaouche> So I decided to roll up my own.
[18:29:17] <ychaouche> if you see it in fullscreen it's better
[18:57:46] <MACscr> if i have a for loop, will the logic after the loop not start until the loop is complete?
[19:05:08] <NinjaBanjo> mac based on this test, yes it will wait
[19:06:06] <NinjaBanjo> im also surprised and the time inconsistencies on start to end
[19:06:32] <NinjaBanjo> its like the first 3 take a few nanoseconds then it takes off doing a bunch
[19:07:58] <NinjaBanjo> MACscr, ^^
[19:10:56] <MACscr> NinjaBanjo: hmm, ok. I have a page that creates boxes (div's with content) that are each created by an ajax form post in a loop. Trying to figure out why the shuffle jquery plugin isnt working in order to help me filter the results. Was just wondering if it was because it was being initiated before the results were displayed
[19:12:02] <NinjaBanjo> if you want to post a fiddle of what the problem is I'd be happy to have a look?
[19:14:02] <MACscr> well with how its doing the ajax request, im not sure if i can provide a working example, but i can at least post the code
[19:14:49] <NinjaBanjo> recreate the for loop with a snippet of what the ajax returns or something
[19:15:02] <NinjaBanjo> or similar mockup code MACscr
[19:19:31] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/n718L3j7/
[19:20:27] <MACscr> actual page with full code and results http://tinyurl.com/p6ytkh8
[19:25:24] <NinjaBanjo> the load in requests your putting onthe server for a long list would be rediculoud
[19:25:30] <NinjaBanjo> MACscr,
[19:29:41] <MACscr> NinjaBanjo: huh? its a single request for the list and then the individual ones for each tld are different servers
[19:30:33] <MACscr> as almost each tld has their own whois servers
[19:30:57] <NinjaBanjo> oh ok
[19:31:36] <MACscr> plus thats obviously not the issue im dealing with =P
[19:36:48] <Velveeta> one thing i can see immediately is that tld_list on line 10 is always going to be undefined
[19:37:43] <Velveeta> the other thing is that your for loop is going to set up a bunch of ajax requests to populate that #results element, but that element isn't going to be populated at the time your shuffle plugin acts on them
[19:38:09] <Velveeta> the for loop itself executes in a synchronous fashion, as in, the code after it doesn't execute until the loop completes
[19:38:28] <Velveeta> however, within the loop, you're kicking off async requests
[19:39:05] <Velveeta> and actually, i just noticed that your first tld_list assignment is using async: false, so in that case, tld_list would probably be assigned a proper value, but that's not an efficient way of writing that code
[19:39:07] <MACscr> Velveeta: ok, so what can i do to make the shuffle plugin more aware of the new content?
[19:39:25] <Velveeta> you want to make sure your shuffle plugin doesn't execute until all of those requests are completed
[19:39:56] <Velveeta> the ajax function itself will return a promise object that you can tie your callback to... if you have a list of them, as in this case, you can use $.when to tie your callback to, which will only execute once all requests have completed
[19:40:03] <MACscr> hmm, ideally i need to be able to filter the results as they are being created
[19:40:33] <Velveeta> i don't know what that shuffle plugin does, nor what filters you're looking to apply to those results
[19:40:55] <Velveeta> but if you want to filter results as each request completes, that can be done also, using the request's promise object
[19:41:10] <Velveeta> i'll show you some example code in your fiddle, but i can't test it obviously, you'll have to adapt it
[19:41:53] <MACscr> i am just trying to hide or show results based on the filter. Filter might be used while the results are happening or after
[19:42:04] <MACscr> im basically trying to create something like http://ookla.domains/
[19:42:07] <MACscr> which is pretty sweet
[19:43:27] <Velveeta> so here's step 1: http://jsfiddle.net/n718L3j7/1/
[19:43:48] <Velveeta> in which we move the grid assignment to line 30 just to cache the dom lookup
[19:44:07] <Velveeta> and on line 48, we put the call to .shuffle(), so it doesn't execute until each request completes
[19:45:20] <MACscr> thanks, i will check it out and see what i can do with it. I appreciate it.
[19:45:43] <MACscr> brb, wife is asking for me
[19:46:01] <Velveeta> so, for future knowledge, when you kick off an async request via $.ajax, your code will continue executing immediately, and your callbacks will be executed when the request completes
[19:46:28] <Velveeta> the $.ajax function returns a promise object that you can chain objects off of using .done(), .fail(), and .always() for success/error/complete respectively
[19:46:52] <Velveeta> so you can do $.ajax(options).done(function () { // this is the same as passing a success: property to your ajax call })
[19:47:42] <Velveeta> and if you have a list of requests that you want to wait until they all complete, and then execute a callback, you can use $.when, either as var dfd1 = $.ajax(options1), dfd2 = $.ajax(options2); $.when(dfd1, dfd2).done(callback);
[19:48:22] <Velveeta> or like this: for (var i = 0, i < N; i++) { dfdArray.push($.ajax(options[i])); } $.when.apply(this, dfdArray).done(callback);
[19:53:13] <Velveeta> also, there's a plugin you might be interested in, you just do: $(this).wife({ verbose: false }) if you want to silence most output, or $(this).wife({ quiet: true }) if you want to silence all output...
[19:54:23] <Velveeta> it has a dependency on another plugin, though, which is $(this).relationship() which returns a promise object, so you can do $(this).relationship().fail(callback)... when using .wife({ quiet: true }) it almost always ends in the error callback being executed..
[20:17:44] <shubhamgoyal> Hi
[20:17:59] <shubhamgoyal> I had a jquery-mobile doubt.
