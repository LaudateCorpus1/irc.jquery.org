[00:01:53] <morfin> hmm
[00:25:53] <rahuldroy> hey guys, can someone point me in the right direction on how to best debug javascript that is generated using PHP
[00:26:13] <Cork> rahuldroy: grab he js generated from the php and run it statically
[00:26:45] <brunoais> rahuldroy, just use it as if it was not generated
[00:27:05] <brunoais> rahuldroy, btw, how much do you change the js dynamically?
[00:27:17] <brunoais> probably the best option is not what you are doing
[00:28:15] <rahuldroy> brunoais: not a lot really. I am just trying to generate a Google map of pointers  from a database
[00:28:16] <Cork> ya, you normally don't want to generate js
[00:28:23] <Cork> it adds complexity you don't need
[00:28:57] <brunoais> normally you want the js and you want to generate the object with the the options for that js execution
[00:29:39] <brunoais> rahuldroy, what are you actually generating?
[00:29:49] <Cork> <script>gMap(<?php echo json_encode(points); ?>);</script>
[00:29:50] <rahuldroy> brunoais: at this stage it is adding an inline script right before the </body> tag
[00:30:24] <brunoais> rahuldroy, which wich content?
[00:30:58] <rahuldroy> http://goyabby.jumta.com.au/classifieds . Everything before the </body> is being generated
[00:33:52] <rahuldroy> what is the best tool in chrome for javscript debugging?? I am already using the inbuilt developer tools with limited success
[00:34:14] <brunoais> rahuldroy, too much
[00:34:24] <brunoais> it can easilly break
[00:35:13] <DarsVaeda> is there a way to have the dialog be as high as the content but never bigger than the visible screen with an option?
[00:35:17] <rahuldroy> brunoais: do you suggest using AJAX instead??
[00:35:25] <brunoais> rahuldroy, hell no!
[00:35:33] <brunoais> use 2 script tags
[00:35:39] <brunoais> 1 will have all that code
[00:35:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you need to handle the height then the screen yourself
[00:36:00] <DarsVaeda> okay
[00:36:11] <brunoais> rahuldroy, in the other, you dynamically write a javascript object with all the content it needs
[00:36:23] <brunoais> the options in the 1st and the main content after
[00:37:13] <brunoais> rahuldroy, you may use PHP's json_encode() to generate the javascript object
[00:37:50] <brunoais> thigs I'd place as vars:
[00:39:08] <rahuldroy> brunoais: hmmm never used JSON in my life
[00:39:27] <rahuldroy> brunoais: :'(
[00:39:32] <brunoais> 'GoYabby-Listings-Map', 'Error: The Geolocation service failed.', 'Error: Your browser doesn\'t support geolocation.', markers = [...], var infoWindowContent = [...]]
[00:39:37] <brunoais> and maybe the position
[00:39:45] <brunoais> rahuldroy, do you know how to make a javascript object?
[00:41:06] <rahuldroy> brunoais: Such a noob when it comes to Javascript & JQuery.
[00:41:20] <rahuldroy> brunoais: I do know how ot make an object
[00:41:32] <brunoais> var objName = {};
[00:41:43] <brunoais> that's an object that is stored in the var objName
[00:41:55] <Cork> better then creating variables you can pass the object to a function doing the work
[00:42:07] <brunoais> JSON is just a notation that uses a stricter version of the object notation in javascript
[00:42:21] <Cork> that is a cleaner solution as you don't pollute the global scope
[00:42:21] <rahuldroy> brunoais: You need to have a browser that supports GeoLocation...
[00:42:49] <rahuldroy> brunoais: I am looking at sample JSON codes
[00:42:50] <brunoais> rahuldroy, if it doesn't then screw it. What's the problem with that ;)?
[00:42:54] <fattest> i have a simple show hide like this, http://pastebin.com/C1tdyiKs however, i want my content to be outside the div. how can i achieve this?
[00:43:29] <Cork> fattest: how are we to know, you don't show the div
[00:43:53] <fattest> ok'
[00:43:55] <fattest> allow me
[00:43:59] <brunoais> fattest, why do you hide both the .trigger and .content?
[00:44:04] <Uhkis> .after() ?
[00:44:07] <Cork> fattest: but as overflow hidden is needed for height animations
[00:44:11] <brunoais> .content is inside the .trigger :S
[00:44:11] <fattest> i'll give it in a demo
[00:44:15] <Cork> you most likely can't solve it
[00:44:31] <brunoais> fattest, use jsfiddle pls
[00:44:34] <rahuldroy> brunoais: haha
[00:44:56] <brunoais> rahuldroy, about sample JSON...
[00:45:00] <brunoais> you don't need to know it
[00:45:14] <brunoais> Just use php's json_encode() function
[00:45:26] <brunoais> it translated a php array to JSON notation
[00:45:31] <brunoais> JSON notation is valid js
[00:45:46] <brunoais> rahuldroy, http://json.org/
[00:46:07] <brunoais> Cork, doesn't jQuery use CSS animations yet?
[00:46:16] <Cork> brunoais: no
[00:46:28] <brunoais> that's... kinda lame...
[00:46:32] <Cork> just like they arn't using requestAnimationFrame
[00:46:46] <brunoais> Is it their option or no one ever went to actually do it?
[00:46:48] <Cork> brunoais: well you don't need jquery to do anything to use it
[00:47:02] <brunoais> the idea with jQuery would be as a fallback
[00:47:12] <Cork> brunoais: there is a plugin for it i think
[00:47:21] <Cork> i just don't bother, as animation isn't a must
[00:47:22] <brunoais> because ppl want all browsers to "look the same" sheeesh....
[00:47:35] <brunoais> when I want to animate I use CSS
[00:47:37] <Cork> older none css3 browsers just don't get the animation, the things jump to the target
[00:47:44] <brunoais> if the browser does not support CSS3 I don't care
[00:47:54] <brunoais> it works anyway
[00:48:06] <Cork> well i do care, but animation should't be essential for the functionality of the page
[00:48:07] <brunoais> but some bosses just want all the same...
[00:48:12] <brunoais> true
[00:48:19] <brunoais> it should be just some flowering
[00:48:28] <Cork> exactly
[00:49:32] <Cork> brunoais: i think the plugin is http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[00:49:43] <Cork> but i don't remember, never cared
[00:50:25] <brunoais> ok
[00:50:29] <brunoais> sounds fair
[00:50:46] <fattest> Cork: http://jsbin.com/supic/1/edit
[00:50:56] <fattest> i want it to work with class content outside of div trigger
[00:52:57] <Cork> fattest: what do you mean by outside?
[00:53:16] <Cork> following the trigger?
[00:53:17] <brunoais> my question too
[00:53:25] <fattest> jsbin.com/supic/1/edit
[00:53:28] <fattest> http://jsbin.com/supic/1/edit  yes
[00:53:35] <fattest> outside <div class = trigger>
[00:54:39] <Cork> so something like http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/1/edit ?
[00:56:06] <fattest> thanks
[00:58:09] <hocza> any good way to implement a live "timeago" feature?
[00:58:21] <hocza> (3 minutes ago... 4 minutes ago...)
[00:58:39] <Cork> hocza: requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout
[00:59:00] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame to have it stop updating when the page isn't focused
[00:59:08] <Cork> and setTimeout to delay it
[01:01:52] <brunoais> hocza, don't forget to use the Date object
[01:02:14] <Cork> well you don't need to if you use requestAnimationFrame
[01:02:17] <brunoais> never trust setTimeout except that the action will happen sometime after the time you set
[01:02:19] <Cork> it will give you a timestamp
[01:02:36] <brunoais> Cork, the current time?
[01:02:41] <Cork> yes
[01:02:53] <Cork> well it is the time of "when the frame is rendered"
[01:02:57] <brunoais> Then he would probably need the original time so that he can subtract
[01:03:05] <Cork> sure
[01:03:20] <Cork> that's a given
[01:04:24] <fattest> Cork: instead of showing content under the image, is it possible to show the content in a different spot in the page? like this well http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/3/edit ?
[01:04:29] <hocza> Cork & brunoais: thank you
[01:04:41] <Yahkob> I feel like I probably shouldn't ask anysort of JS question in here but #javascript is dead
[01:04:59] <brunoais> hocza, you are welcome
[01:05:10] <brunoais> Yahkob, no wonder :D
[01:05:16] <Yahkob> haha
[01:05:46] <Cork> fattest: well sure, but then you need to figure out how you want it to relate to the current element
[01:06:10] <Cork> fattest: if you want any element to trigger the same content, that is easy
[01:06:12] <fattest> Cork: i should use id
[01:06:16] <brunoais> for that I usually use data-* attributes
[01:06:26] <Cork> that is an option ya
[01:06:39] <brunoais> and I usually namespace them somewhat like this
[01:06:44] <brunoais> data-js-*
[01:06:51] <brunoais> that way I know they are used by the JS
[01:07:13] <fattest> i have <div id="content2">SECOND BOX</div> and <div id="content1">first box</div>
[01:07:20] <brunoais> if, for some weird reason, I need them for CSS, I'd namespace them as: data-css
[01:07:25] <fattest> this can be used to trigger right?
[01:07:35] <brunoais> fattest, yes
[01:07:39] <Cork> brunoais: that is kinda pointless...
[01:07:42] <brunoais> careful with ID's, though
[01:07:51] <brunoais> Cork, yeah, I never used those, yet
[01:08:02] <brunoais> I use classes, instead
[01:08:09] <Cork> what i meant -js-
[01:08:10] <fattest> will i have to copy paste the js 6 times i want 6 different show hides
[01:08:13] <Cork> i don't see a point for it
[01:08:15] <brunoais> Cork, why?
[01:08:21] <brunoais> Hum... maybe
[01:08:24] <Cork> name spacing it for what use it has is meaningful
[01:08:29] <brunoais> I just like to be explicit
[01:08:40] <Cork> but dictating with a scope if it was created by js or not make little sense
[01:08:51] <brunoais> Ah, I get your point
[01:09:33] <Cork> meaning something like data-target-id
[01:09:37] <Cork> makes sense
[01:09:46] <Cork> while data-js-id is ??
[01:13:32] <brunoais> Cork, I'd actually use data-js-target-id
[01:13:50] <Cork> but what point is it to -js-?
[01:14:01] <brunoais> or better, when I separate into multiple parts/modules/whatever (usually for larger programs)
[01:14:08] <brunoais> It's meant for the js to use
[01:14:14] <Cork> what the data is fore matters, where it is used doesn't belong there
[01:14:17] <brunoais> but when I have those like above I mention like this:
[01:14:37] <brunoais> data-nameOfResponsible-*
[01:14:40] <Cork> having to rename it to data-js_css-target-id just cause you happen to want it in css is just silly
[01:14:40] <fattest> Cork: i have something like this http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/3/edit how am i going?
[01:15:20] <brunoais> Cork, yeah... actually I use js for when it's soem code in the global namespace without a well defined name
[01:15:37] <brunoais> weird that I only really noticed now -_-
[01:16:50] <brunoais> Cork, sorry for that messup
[01:17:45] <Cork> fattest: http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/5/edit
[01:17:52] <Cork> class and id isn't the same thing ;)
[01:18:20] <Cork> that made me wonder "why the f***** isn't this working" :D
[01:19:09] <DarsVaeda> can someone explain "my" and "at" in the jquery ui dialog position options?
[01:19:41] <DarsVaeda> that seems totally random O_o
[01:19:56] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[01:19:58] <hocza> oh what did I find? http://timeago.yarp.com/
[01:20:16] <DarsVaeda> Cork, yeah that's where I got that
[01:20:36] <DarsVaeda> but what does my mean?
[01:20:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: my is the dialogs at is where it should be in relation to the container
[01:20:46] <Cork> and of is the container
[01:21:11] <Cork> "my center should be at the bottom of the window"
[01:21:29] <Cork> "my top should be at the top of the window"
[01:21:33] <DarsVaeda> someone was really smart there hmm
[01:21:52] <DarsVaeda> I don't think many people will get that :O
[01:22:04] <Cork> DarsVaeda: why not?
[01:22:08] <Cork> seams obvious to me
[01:22:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and if you need info about it they link you here http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[01:24:00] <fattest> Cork: is it possible to show it in the well?
[01:24:05] <fattest> instead of showing it right underneath
[01:24:27] <Cork> fattest: if with the second code you can have it anywhere on the page
[01:25:24] <DarsVaeda> I didn't see the connection, I think it would be nice at least to mention my and at close to the link
[01:25:52] <fattest> Cork: like http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/3/edit ?
[01:26:03] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[01:26:10] <Cork> the Object section
[01:26:34] <Cork> fattest: you missed my response?
[01:28:10] <Cork> fattest: but cleaning it up, this is how i would do it http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/6/edit
[01:30:51] <fattest> Cork: thank you8!
[01:38:04] <OneThirtyEight> Hi. What do you think is a good practice for hooking up click events when you have an app with both static elements and dynamically added elements
[01:38:26] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: delegated event listener
[01:38:41] <OneThirtyEight> I just discovered that you can use delegates to hook up events to dynamically added elements
[01:39:20] <OneThirtyEight> But would you only use delegates to handle everything or would you also do 'standard' event hookups on document.ready as well?
[01:39:41] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: the delegated event listeners need to go inside ready too
[01:40:14] <OneThirtyEight> Currently I've got an initialize function which uses .on() to hook up click events. it's called on document ready. Later I've also added some delegates
[01:40:15] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: and delegated event listeners only really makes sense when you have more then one element for the event handler
[01:40:44] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: also .on can be both bind and delegate
[01:40:57] <Cork> depending on your syntax
[01:43:55] <OneThirtyEight> would you separate the delegate event hookup from the event hookups you do for static elements?
[01:44:04] <OneThirtyEight> Or is there a way to have it all in one function ?
[01:44:39] <OneThirtyEight> (for small apps I usually have a single initializeEvents function which does all the hookups)
[01:45:41] <OneThirtyEight> but currently I've got two functions, one that handles the delegate stuff for dynamically added elements and one that handles 'regular' hookups for static elements. Is that reasonable?
[01:46:01] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: there is nothing preventing them from being assigned in the same function
[01:46:24] <Cork> (why would there be)
[01:46:40] <fattest> Cork: is it possible that, if user clicks on trigger, and clicks on another trigger, instead of showing both the contents, i want to hide the previous trigger and show the new trigger? http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/7/edit
[01:47:22] <OneThirtyEight> Yeah sure it can be one function but what I'm getting at is: do you separate the dynamic stuff from the static stuff?
[01:47:37] <Cork> fattest: sure, just animate the other element
[01:47:42] <Cork> (or both of them)
[01:48:03] <OneThirtyEight> cuz I guess it would be possible to ONLY have delegates for every single event
[01:48:29] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: i don't see the point
[01:48:47] <Cork> the function shouldn't be about the type of event, but what the events collectively is suppose to do
[01:48:53] <fattest> Cork: it is this line  $('#info' + $(this).data('target-nr')).animate(... instead of $(This), i have to change it right
[01:49:24] <Cork> fattest: $('.content').not('#info' + $(this).data('target-nr'))
[01:49:43] <Cork> and after that a toggle on the target
[01:50:43] <fattest> Cork: like this ? http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/7/edit
[01:50:56] <Cork> no
[01:51:17] <fattest> oh
[01:51:21] <Cork> you animate all except the target to height 0
[01:51:24] <fattest> i think i understand
[01:51:27] <Cork> and then toggle the target
[01:52:08] <fattest> http://jsbin.com/mugahuda/7/edit ?
[01:58:21] <fattest> Cork: this works   $('.info').not('#info' + $(this).data('target-nr')).hide();
[02:02:41] <morfin> not sure but is there difference with $(".info:not(#info"+$(this).data('target-nr')+")?
[02:03:06] <Cork> morada: the code has to go through more steps
[02:03:19] <Cork> as it has to parse the string in sizzle and then call jquery from there
[02:03:45] <morfin> ok except parsing
[02:04:40] <morfin> does not it with .not just filter results of first selector but when you use :not checks on place
[02:05:06] <OneThirtyEight> Cork: the problem is that I feel like I'm having to remember to create event hookups twice and I'm unsure if there's a better way to do it or not :P maybe I can describe my situation and you can comment on it
[02:05:24] <OneThirtyEight> Say I'm creating some static buttons with the class 'btnAdd' and I want to add btnAddClick() as the click event for that class. In that case I'd first create a $('.btnAdd').on('click', function(){ addSomething() });
[02:05:34] <morfin> oh
[02:05:37] <morfin> The .not() method will end up providing you with more readable selections than pushing complex selectors or variables into a :not() selector filter. In most cases, it is a better choice.
[02:06:20] <morfin> ok i see now
[02:06:43] <Cork> morada: yes that too
[02:06:49] <morfin> morfin.
[02:07:01] <Cork> but it will also be more preferment
[02:07:24] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: could you make a jsfiddle of your problem?
[02:07:26] <OneThirtyEight> But then I remember that  elements with the class 'btnAdd' might be added dynamically. In that case I have to go back to the code and add the same hookup again in the delegate
[02:07:31] <OneThirtyEight> sure, jsfiddle comin up
[02:07:32] <Cork> i really don't follow why this would be a problem
[02:08:52] <OneThirtyEight> the problem is that I'm adding event hookups for one single thing in 2 places in the code. and sometimes I forget to do it.. used to just have to add it to 1 place
[02:09:51] <OneThirtyEight> so just wanted to confirm that that's the way to do it. if so I can learn to live with it :P but maybe there's a better way
[02:13:04] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: from what it sounds like, no your not suppose to do it like that
[02:13:11] <Cork> but it sounds a bit confused so not sure
[02:14:22] <OneThirtyEight> Cork: heh, problem solved. after messing around in fiddle I noticed that I could just remove some of my hookups for static elements and only use the delegate hookups for everything :P
[02:15:05] <OneThirtyEight> thanks for the feedback
[02:20:23] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: ya, that was what i suspected :)
[02:20:43] <Cork> OneThirtyEight: recreating the question is often a very good help to help yourself ^^
[02:23:09] <abhvym> i have ul of items. some items have subitems recursively. how do i make jquery hide all subitems on page load. and show them on click on parent item.
[02:23:53] <erming> abhvym: i would hide them with CSS to begin with
[02:24:27] <abhvym> css? how?
[02:24:28] <erming> you have a hieararchy like this: <ul> <li class="first-item"> ... <ul><li class="child"></li></ul> </li> </ul>?
[02:24:32] <Cork> abhvym: $('#group > li ul').hide(); $('#group').on('click', 'li', function() { $(this).children('ul').toggle(); })
[02:25:14] <erming> to hide all subitems, if that html structure is correct: ul ul { display: none; }
[02:25:18] <Cork> where #group is the outer most ul
[02:25:44] <Cork> erming: if you want to animate it with jquery you should avoid display: none;
[02:25:48] <abhvym> erming, there are "n" numbers of <ul> </ul> those are random. inside this first ul there are "n" numbmers of <ul></ul> those too are random.
[02:25:59] <erming> Cork: what does hide() do?
[02:26:10] <abhvym> thery may be "n" number of this depth.
[02:26:15] <erming> it hides with display: none; right?
[02:26:19] <Cork> erming: it stores the old display value and sets display: none
[02:26:23] <erming> aha
[02:26:29] <Cork> it's the first part that makes the difference
[02:26:29] <erming> true
[02:26:37] * abhvym thought Cork is bot.
[02:27:15] <erming> you mean AI.. he gets offended when you call him a bot
[02:27:29] <abhvym> okey.
[02:27:32] <erming> :>
[02:27:33] <erming> brb
[02:27:34] <Cork> lol
[02:32:39] <hxm> $('ul.#menu') is incorrect?
[02:34:10] <seutje> yes
[02:34:35] <Cork> uh.. no
[02:34:47] <seutje> ul.menu would imply <ul class="menu"> ul#menu would imply <ul id="menu"> and is functionally equivalent to #menu
[02:34:47] <Cork> 1. don't put tag names infront of id's
[02:35:17] <Cork> seutje: it's .# that isn't valid
[02:35:22] <seutje> exactly
[02:35:29] <Cork> ugg...
[02:35:34] <seutje> he asked "is this incorrect" so "yes, it is incorrect"
[02:35:35] <Cork> sorry i inverted the question >_<'
[02:35:40] <seutje> s'ok
[02:35:44] <seutje> coffee? :D
[02:35:59] <Cork> why asks if something is incorrect! >_<
[02:36:01] <Cork> ;P
[02:36:06] <hxm> im listening il divo so i am more productive now
[02:36:09] <seutje> I got caught up in OOPHP shenanigans and mine got cold :(
[02:36:12] * hxm hides under table
[02:36:48] <Cork> hxm: i wasn't serious ^^'
[02:37:19] <Cork> hxm: but you need to explain what you're trying to match
[02:38:07] <hxm> i was reading a doc of superfish plugin which creates a fancy nav menu and i saw the example he used ul.sf-menu, which is a class, so i guess that's correct, but then i had the curiosity to know if it works with the idname too
[02:38:15] <Justice> Um im getting a bit confused about pagecreate and other events when reading the docs on jquery mobile. My question is is it still possible to read the scripts in <head> when loading a page with an ajax function ?
[02:38:21] <hxm> but yea, is even useless since the id is unique
[02:38:41] <Cork> hxm: ify ou have an id you just do $('#menu')
[02:38:58] <Justice> And do I have to use jquery's loadpage to make it work ?
[02:39:01] <hxm> yes, i tried it and using ul#menu returns a unrecognized expression
[02:39:01] <Cork> you CAN do ul#menu
[02:39:03] <Cork> it is valid
[02:39:06] <hxm> ah
[02:39:09] <hxm> so hm
[02:39:09] <Cork> but it makes the selector slow
[02:40:12] <Voyage> is there a way in jquery date picker to select the month only?
[02:40:36] <Cork> Voyage: not naively no
[02:40:44] <Cork> there are plugins extending it to do it though
[02:42:32] <Voyage> Cork,  which plugin?
[02:42:51] <Cork> Voyage: tried googling for jquery monthpicker?
[02:44:26] <Voyage> oh ok
[02:47:58] <Voyage> Cork,  this does it by pure jquery UI http://jsfiddle.net/bopperben/DBpJe/
[02:50:04] <Voyage> Cork,  any comments?
[02:50:12] <Cork> nope
[02:50:20] <Cork> test if it works for you if it does; good
[03:48:10] <Justice> Im trying to create a "framework" for a page, meaning only shifting is some contents on that page when clicking on links and still keeping the rest. Each page it loads have a <script> file etc. But looking at documentation it seems that scripts wont be read and im bit confused how I should proceed.
[03:48:38] <Justice> tried using my own ajax page loader but it seems that scripts are still blocked.
[03:49:13] <Cork> Justice: not sure what the question is
[03:49:29] <Cork> Justice: your trying to load additional script tags through html sent over ajax?
[03:59:00] <Justice> Cork: yeah
[03:59:20] <Cork> Justice: jquery will execute those
[03:59:31] <Cork> but not in context of the html
[03:59:50] <Cork> so they need to use ids and classes to select the content
[04:00:27] <Justice> Cork: I see, this is the page in question btw = http://dvwebb.mah.se/m10p2603/icu/teacher/
[04:00:55] <Justice> i have my own loadpage in the main script but it still uses on ready in jquery that i know should be avoided as per documentation
[04:01:55] <Cork> $(document).on("ready", start); <-- ready isn't an event
[04:01:58] <Cork> its a function
[04:02:30] <Cork> but ya, i don't know what i'm suppose to look for here
[04:02:36] <Cork> you need to give more context
[04:04:19] <Justice> Cork: when you click on a menu item on the left it replaces the "#content" with a HTML doc that the new page contains and keeping the rest. However i noticed the LoadPage of jquery mobile has its own functions that maybe its not the best way to proceed?
[04:05:20] <Cork> still don't see the problem
[04:07:47] <Justice> Well by using my own loadpage im overshadowing the build in one not sure if thats a good thing.  And also the left panel will have dynamic pages that will be loaded from a database and when I tried that the new <li> did not have the correct theme
[04:08:13] <Justice> latter thing im guessing i have to have the script using an event (before) so that jquery does it's theme thing?
[04:08:45] <Cork> Justice: ya, jquery mobile is very js centric
[04:09:03] <Cork> so you prob need to run some theme function to get the stying correct
[04:09:18] <Cork> i don't know enough about jqm to know what function that would be though
[04:14:04] <Justice> Cork: mm, but in all the script is loaded but will only execute events ?. Because i know that i can have one big script file but want to avoid that since programming with other people wont be that pleasant :P
[04:14:39] <Cork> Justice: there is no events from adding content to the page
[04:14:53] <Cork> so you need to tell jqm that you have added new content
[04:15:12] <Cork> (as much of its theming is done by modifying the html)
[04:18:05] <Justice> yea
[04:47:04] <Bauer> guys, if I have a .click bind on an input button, and it looks like this: <input type="button" alt="string of data" name="different data" host_id="3706" value="Destroy" class="destroy">, and inside the triggered .click function, I have stuff like var something = this.name;, and now I wanna add var host_id = this.host_id,  apparently my host_id remains undefined - why?
[04:50:56] <Bauer> ok, in other words, my question is why for name, its enough to do this.name, but for host_id, I need to do this.attributes.host_id.value?
[04:55:32] <erming> Bauer, you could use .prop("name") and .prop("host_id") though
[04:56:13] <Bauer> erming: yes, but why is the behaviour different? if this.name works, why doesnt any other this.attr_name works?
[04:56:15] <sahbeewah_> Bauer: there's an internal two-way binding between a node's properties and its valid attributes such that you can access the node's attributes by doing something like this.name (for inputs)
[04:56:45] <sahbeewah_> host_id is not a valid attribute for input elements, therefore this binding is not supported in browsers
[04:57:09] <erming> i guess it's up to the DOM implementation, where "name" is a standard keyword already
[04:57:41] <Bauer> ahh, so anything that is not a valid attribute, I have to fetch in indirect means.. thats not very consistent behaviour :/
[04:59:51] <tristan1990> Is there anything available pre-built that could be used as a really nice clean CMS for a bootstrap site? I'm looking for something so simple it hurts but users can edit pages without faffing around with WP
[05:02:17] <sahbeewah_> Bauer: if you create an invalid dom you shouldn't expect valid behaviour. consider potential side-effects of having an attribute of "innerHTML" or "toString" on an element.
[05:03:37] <Bauer> sahbeewah: but its so comfortable to pass along a few values using attributes to a single button... and much cleaner and tidy
[05:03:42] <Bauer> than hidden inputs
[05:06:16] <sahbeewah_> you can use jQuery's .data() method, or use data-* attributes which are supported by html5
[05:07:19] <marlinc> I need to create a jQuery selector that uses HTML comments. Something like <!-- BLOCK: menu --><nav>Other nav code</nav><!-- END-BLOCK: menu -->. So I can select that menu block and change its contents
[05:08:30] <sahbeewah_> Bauer: <input data-host_id="123">, then you can use $(this).data('host_id') or this.dataset.host_id
[05:09:24] <Bauer> hmmm, very neat, tahnks sahbeewah_ :)
[05:14:17] <sahbeewah_> marlinc: i was going to say that's impossible, but it's probably possible. the better question is, why would you want to do that?
[05:14:49] <sahbeewah_> wrap the nav in a div?
[05:15:15] <marlinc> Well that's strange because divs don't work that well
[05:15:26] <marlinc> Because of the CSS that Bootstrap uses
[05:16:00] <marlinc> It causes style issues when I wrap the content in a div
[05:17:17] <sahbeewah_> well, use CSS to fix the style issues. that's going to be a far more elegant solution
[05:18:25] <marlinc> Well.. We'll try and see what I can do using CSS to fix it
[05:19:07] <sahbeewah_> or put some sort of common class on the nav and any other encompassing elements that may be switched into it, and replace the contents with .replaceWith
[05:19:18] <decx> why would bootstrap restyle blank divs?
[05:20:51] <decx> i'm calling shenanigans, bootstrap does certainly not restyle a div without a class
[05:22:19] <Polar_> What, I always thought bootsrap styled divs without class to gold :(
[05:22:26] <Polar_> I guess I aint that rich then :(
[05:22:38] <decx> div4gold, sell now
[05:42:19] <ankurk_> So I am appending rows on click of a button to a table. It actually happens on ajax success. Can I avoid the append on every click?
[05:43:24] <Cork> ankurk_: add a blocker on the click until the ajax response comes back
[05:43:39] <Cork> $(this).data('pending', true')
[05:43:41] <Cork> *$(this).data('pending', true)
[05:43:56] <Cork> if($(this).data('pending')) { return; }
[05:45:07] <ankurk_> But data is not that much
[05:45:15] <ankurk_> so the ajax is quite fast
[05:45:35] <Cork> ankurk_: not sure what you mean
[05:46:55] <ankurk_> Data I receive is not that much so success happens pretty fast
[05:47:16] <Cork> ok?
[05:47:59] <ankurk_> so every time I click again, the duplicate rows get appended
[05:48:02] <ankurk_> I want to avoid that
[05:48:46] <Cork> and the command i gave you doesn't work cause?
[06:07:27] <Ownix> can anyone tell my why line 3 wont show the objects new position? http://jsfiddle.net/BZxjC/2/
[06:10:22] <Justice> is it possible to have pagesception in jquerymobile?
[06:11:25] <Justice> in plain words, page within a page and then update page 2 with contets and still having page 1 untouched
[06:11:31] <Justice> contents*
[06:12:23] <BillCriswell> Ownix: You're just adjusting the position you grabbed from the element, not the elements position.
[06:12:36] <MikeD_> $(target).append('<footer>').append('<button>')  <-- does the button get appended to target or to the newly-created footer?
[06:13:43] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: The target.
[06:14:22] <BillCriswell> Just had to try it out. I was expecting it to be in footer for some reason.
[06:14:31] <Ownix> BillCriswell: why does adjusting the actual position not do anything? http://jsfiddle.net/BZxjC/3/
[06:15:20] <MikeD_> thanks, I also tried it and thought I was doing something wrong - i also was expecting the chain to keep moving the object reference
[06:16:42] <MikeD_> is there a suggested best practice for generating dom objects, including the behaviors (.on(), etc) that's easy to read / maintain ?
[06:17:46] <BillCriswell> Ownix: I tried to answer too quick without seeing the whole thing.
[06:18:34] <Ownix> BillCriswell: well you were right because I was adjusting margins on ASDW. However, doing .css( 'left: "-=3px" ) does not do anything
[06:18:56] <Ownix> BillCriswell: this works http://jsfiddle.net/BZxjC/4/
[06:22:45] <BillCriswell> Maybe that's only cool in animate?
[06:23:43] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I try to keep DOM generation in a template, but if I'm not using a template I tend to just go with a string or array.. I'm sure there's better ways haha.
[06:23:52] <decx> ugh, markup gaming
[06:24:16] <MikeD_> decx:  "because it's there"
[06:24:31] <BillCriswell> Is markup gaming bad?
[06:25:10] <decx> it never going to be responsive (in the actual sense) unless you use translate3d an even then it's shite.
[06:25:23] <MikeD_> did you see mozilla's browserquest ?  it was a pretty cool demo/poc of HTML5 gaming
[06:25:51] <decx> that's canvas
[06:25:55] <decx> canvas is cool
[06:26:00] <MikeD_> haha
[06:26:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Got ya.
[06:26:29] <BillCriswell> Can you use what you learn through doing things this way to canvas? Don't mess around with canvas as often as I should.
[06:26:37] <BillCriswell> Not that I ever plan on building games but you never know.
[06:27:06] <decx> it's a fun way to write mroe native js
[06:27:27] <BillCriswell> Ah, groovy.
[06:28:10] <decx> also, try animating 10000 divs with .animate() reacting to mouseposition, yikes
[06:28:19] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/T45kX/show/
[06:28:26] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha no thanks.
[06:28:38] <BillCriswell> 10000 divs just sitting there makes me uneasy.
[06:29:03] <decx> hehe
[06:29:49] <erming> wow, cool effect
[06:30:36] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'm spelunking. I never want to do that ever.
[06:30:50] <Polar_> decx: could have said it causes epileptic seizures
[06:31:04] <BillCriswell> What's one little seizure going to do?
[06:31:14] <decx> sorry :( (not sorry :>)
[06:31:35] <Polar_> :(
[06:32:44] <Cork> O_o
[06:33:03] <Cork> decx: i wouldn't even try doing that with css
[06:35:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Wimp.
[06:35:23] <Cork> BillCriswell: heh
[06:35:28] <decx> some of these css3 spinners have a comparable amount of elements animated with css ;)
[06:35:36] <drej> lol
[06:35:52] <decx> imma need a loading.gif for that loading.css spinner
[06:36:50] <drej> thats neat decx
[06:37:57] <decx> yeah that's probably all it is, certainly not useful haha
[06:38:12] <decx> maybe as a background for a bongshop site
[06:38:13] <decx> ;)
[06:38:22] <Cork> decx: that link reminds me of one of the demos ms made
[06:38:33] <domenico> Hello, When I style something inside jquery ui tab that style is applied to the entire tab, why?
[06:38:43] <BillCriswell> I can't believe how much time goes into loading gifs and shit. Can't wait till they're a thing of the past.
[06:38:51] <BillCriswell> Loading anything, just blah.
[06:38:58] <Cork> where they animated the background color of the page from rgb(255, 255, 255) to rgb(254, 254, 254) back and forth
[06:38:59] <decx> it's very basic, jsut creating points, moving them in one direction and changing velocity and size on distance to cursor
[06:39:07] <Cork> just to make the other browsers slow :)
[06:39:15] <decx> haha
[06:39:31] <Cork> (cause they invalidated the entire page)
[06:41:39] <BillCriswell> Ugh, just saw an article "Page Loading Effects"
[06:41:56] <decx> with the windshield wiper?
[06:41:57] <BillCriswell> While they look awesome. I can't believe the attention we have to pay to loading screens.
[06:42:06] <erming> http://tympanus.net/Development/ProgressButtonStyles/
[06:42:10] <erming> look at these things
[06:43:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes, from that demo.
[06:43:07] <decx> some of these are neat
[06:43:17] <BillCriswell> erming: There's tons of great effects throughout that site.
[06:43:41] <erming> yeah, i just came to think of them.. and that i had that page bookmarked
[06:44:43] <BillCriswell> I wish I could get paid to write things like that. Just write fun CSS all day.
[06:45:48] <erming> BillCriswell: frontend developer, go go! but don't tell them you actually know any programming :>
[06:47:04] <BillCriswell> erming: That's what I primarily do. Don't get to do too much fun animationy stuff though.
[06:48:44] <decx> if you're always fiddling around anyway you just gotta start blogging about it, put some ads on that fucker and before you know it, you're the new css-tricks
[07:01:06] <ankurk_> For some weird reason, I have started enjoying backend work :P
[07:01:43] <Cork> i find doing all the stack is most rewarding
[07:01:57] <BillCriswell> decx: He has so much content. It would be damn near impossible to catch up haha
[07:02:11] <ankurk_> though sometimes I love all the stack as well :D
[07:02:29] <BillCriswell> I've been playing with sails.js. It's making sense, which is huge for me cause a lot of things don't.
[07:02:55] <BillCriswell> It's friendly as hell too. Well commented in the source code so you don't even have to visit the docs that often.
[07:03:32] <ankurk_> and about that duplicate rows issue, I found a way, I first check the number of rows in the table and only append if number of rows is = 0
[07:03:43] <decx> why would their hero illustration be a a squid and not a ship, i feel like i'm taking crazy pills here
[07:04:17] <BillCriswell> decx: You can do more with 8 tentacles than one boat!... maybe.
[07:04:36] <decx> according to all the hentai i watched, that is true
[07:04:46] <BillCriswell> Plus you can't put nerd glasses on a boat you dummy.
[07:05:46] <decx> now that's a compelling argument
[07:13:46] <Thoams> hi all - got a problem with multiple tooltips being opened then refusing to close. Pretty sure it's because mouseleave events aren't getting fired, but even trying to setTimeout to close after a couple of seconds isn't closing them!
[07:15:43] <seutje> using a single instance to controll all of them?
[07:15:46] <seutje> control*
[07:16:21] <BillCriswell> Thoams: Would need to see the code. Can you make a small demo of the issue?

[07:21:11] <seutje> decx: omg stealing that
[07:21:31] <decx> i would use the bots message but i can never remember the prefix
[07:21:36] <decx> so that will have to do ^^
[07:21:39] <Frazzz> hi
[07:22:13] <seutje> don't think factoids are on here
[07:22:18] <seutje> `halp is http://i.imgur.com/HC8ylsw.png
[07:22:18] <b-ot> seutje: memorised “halp”.
[07:22:21] <Frazzz> im using offset to set the position of an element to the same position as another, but in ie the left offset seems to be a few pixels too many
[07:22:23] <seutje> guess is it
[07:22:31] <bumbar> can't figure out what i'm doing wrong here: https://dpaste.de/ZQGE -- dict.data is empty when logging to console
[07:22:35] <Frazzz> does anyone know about this and how to fix it?
[07:23:16] <decx> here's an exploitable seutje http://i.imgur.com/GEpJKy5.png
[07:24:00] <seutje> nah, the annotations were pretty much spot on
[07:24:26] <decx> but how will you post wrong captioned memes to facebook?
[07:24:28] <decx> ^^
[07:25:16] <erming> bumbar: $("form").serialize(); <-- does this output anything?
[07:26:34] <erming> try "data": "hello console!" and see if that works
[07:26:43] <bumbar> erming, it does in console
[07:28:01] <bumbar> erming, it logs with "hello console" string, but not with serialize
[07:28:32] <seutje> decx: what's a face book?
[07:28:35] <seutje> :P
[07:29:10] <erming> bumbar: just before you call f({...}), console.log the .serialize();
[07:29:31] <erming> or rather: do this
[07:29:42] <erming> console.log($("form").size());
[07:30:26] <erming> .. excuse me, $("form").length is the correct way
[07:30:42] <bumbar> well, that won't work because 1st ajax call is to get form, and 2nd is to save
[07:31:50] <erming> oh, so <form> has been added from another ajax request
[07:32:52] <bumbar> yeah, but the code works if put "raw" data and callback, i'm trying to refactor it to a function
[07:33:00] <erming> well, obviously $("form") doesnt find the form you've just added.. and f(..) is called _after_ you've added the form?
[07:33:21] <bumbar> yeah, just figured it out
[07:33:27] <erming> great
[07:33:34] <bumbar> thanks though! :)
[07:33:55] <erming> hah, just talking about a problem usually helps :> np
[07:53:35] <HiMax> hello, is this correct way to set many new css properties in jquery ? $('.msgQ').css('background-image', 'img/spiderman_2.jpg').css('font-family', fstyle).css('font-size', parseInt(fsize)+'px').css('color', fcolor);
[07:54:04] <NoiseEee_> HiMax: pass an object
[07:54:35] <NoiseEee_> {'font-family':fstyle,color:fcolor}
[07:55:15] <NoiseEee_> HiMax: http://api.jquery.com/css/ example: change the weight and background...
[07:55:29] <ankurk_> HiMax: or addClass
[07:56:30] <HiMax> NoiseEee_: like this is $('.msgQ').css({'background-image': 'img/spiderman_2.jpg','font-family': fstyle,'font-size': parseInt(fsize)+'px','color': fcolor});
[07:57:09] <bumbar> erming, sorry to disturb you again, but i'm trying to bind that function to a click event, and it works on one page but doesn't on another, https://dpaste.de/8LGO
[07:57:21] <bumbar> both pages are using same part of template, so id's are correct
[07:57:39] <HiMax> ankurk_: no class
[07:59:34] <HiMax> NoiseEee_: ty it works
[08:00:33] <apipkin> what version of jquery-ui has the _on method for the WidgetFactory? I'm looking at docs, but cannot find when it first landed.

[08:04:26] <Spleeze> does anyone have a good link to a tutorial to help me wrap my head around callbacks and the proper way to write ajax utilizing them?
[08:05:57] <bumbar> NoiseEee_, none, event doesn't seem to be triggered, i think the problem is in code inclusion
[08:06:54] <shoky> apipkin: 1.9
[08:07:18] <NoiseEee_> bumbar: well its impossible to help you if thats the only code you are providing
[08:07:32] <apipkin> shoky: Thanks! Is that listed in the docs somewhere (maybe I'm just overlooking it)

[08:32:44] <Ownix> decx: yeah I couldn't figure that part out
[08:33:09] <Ownix> Its just a proof of concept for me. Game programming is neat but I don't think I'll ever make a good one
[08:33:12] <Ownix> Too much math
[08:33:55] <MikeD_> don't game engines typically hide that from the devs?
[08:34:39] <Ownix> MikeD_: hide what?
[08:34:42] <Ownix> The math?
[08:34:47] <MikeD_> the "too much math"
[08:34:56] <Ownix> Im not sure ive never used one
[08:35:54] <decx> doesn'T matter if you will ever make a good game dev, the concepts you learn while attempting low latency stuff like a game is valuable
[08:36:03] <decx> http://canvas.decx.org
[08:36:33] <Ownix> decx: thats awesome!
[08:36:44] <pastry> some game loops techniques can be backported to improve the classical js app rendering
[08:37:40] <pastry> I've extracted the classic `requestAnimationFrame` used for game loops on https://github.com/zenoamaro/honeyloops
[08:38:04] <pastry> I believe it's one of the tricks also employed by React
[08:38:47] <pastry> anyway, with all those states and object managers etc. a big js app is basically just a very boring game
[08:39:07] <decx> hehe
[08:39:38] <MikeD_> "a very boring game" indeed.
[08:40:08] <Ownix> pastry: that looks pretty useful
[08:41:19] <pastry> Ownix: thanks, right now it's basically an easy inversion of control of requestAnimationFrame, though I'd like to add some helpers for doing common tasks when coding in this style
[08:41:41] <Ownix> pastry: why common tasks did you have in mind?
[08:41:45] <pastry> like queues, consumers and throttles
[08:41:49] <Ownix> ah
[08:42:48] <pastry> yes as the function call is debounced and rate limited you can't do anything like call the same function multiple times per frame to update it
[08:43:06] <pastry> one solution is storing all the calls being made
[08:43:12] <pastry> then render them at the pace you prefer
[08:43:19] <pastry> eg. 5 per frame
[08:44:17] <pastry> anyway, let me know if you get around to it and find it useful
[08:46:19] <Ownix> Will do, I suspect work projects will be picking up soon though
[08:48:13] <marlinc> Is there a way to catch 'No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the reques' errors?
[08:50:08] <duch_kazatel> there's a way to see the error response, if that's what you mean.
[08:50:31] <pastry> marlinc: does it show up on the xhr object? though it may be this way by design
[08:52:56] <marlinc> I'm looking at the error callback atm
[08:53:05] <marlinc> Maybe there's something that's being thrown
[08:53:17] <duch_kazatel> you should use .fail() btw.
[08:53:42] <duch_kazatel> .fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) { console.log(textStatus) });
[08:53:59] <duch_kazatel> or  .fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) { console.log(errorThrown) });
[08:54:19] <BillCriswell> Just came across something so simple that it hurt my feels I was struggling with it.
[08:54:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell :( what was it?
[08:54:49] <str8uplinux> trying to create a key =>value array to pass to php. i want to loop through each input field, use the id as the key and the value as the value. What is the best way to do this so php can handle it?
[08:55:00] <BillCriswell> Having an element expand outside of a container to full width of the page.
[08:55:11] <duch_kazatel> str8uplinux you want javascript object that you then stringify
[08:55:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing.
[08:55:26] <marlinc> Mm okay I'l check
[08:55:36] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell aaaah.  that seems like one of those "i'd make it harder on myself that need be"
[08:56:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/mujezawe/1/edit
[08:56:15] <duch_kazatel> https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/812643/artery-chokes-after-70-copies-of-visual-studio wtf
[08:56:35] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell interesting.
[08:56:59] <BillCriswell> You're not kidding haha.
[08:57:21] <duch_kazatel> that's a heckuva lot simpler than i would have though.
[08:57:23] <duch_kazatel> *thought
[08:58:02] <decx> hardcoding distances? you should be ashamed
[08:58:20] <decx> position: fixed; width: 100%; left:0
[08:58:25] <decx> ;)
[08:58:37] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:58:48] <duch_kazatel> but the fixed positioning won't allow it to scroll with the other content will it?
[08:59:00] <BillCriswell> It owuld not.
[08:59:13] <decx> of course not
[08:59:20] <duch_kazatel> quick write some JS to set the vertical offset on scroll
[08:59:21] <duch_kazatel> :(
[09:00:09] <saml> hey,  $.ajax({url:url,dataType:'jsonp',cache:true,jsonpCallback:'nonExistingFunction').done(handleThis);     how come handleThis  still gets called?
[09:00:11] <saml> it's a magic!
[09:00:32] <BillCriswell> I've seen people do :before, :after { width: 1000px; } ish type stuff. Not good.
[09:00:43] <BillCriswell> BRB.
[09:00:58] <shoky> saml: jsonpCallback is just the name of the callback jquery will use
[09:00:59] <decx> it's a bit more finicky but i prefer to have an outercontainer at fullwidth and an inner container with the normal width to break up one-width-monotony in layouts
[09:01:17] <duch_kazatel> saml because the ajax call is successful?
[09:01:30] <saml> shoky,  yah i know. so the server responds with  nonExistingFunction({...});    but there's no error
[09:01:44] <shoky> saml: because that's how jsonp works. jquery will create the function
[09:01:52] <saml> oh it will?
[09:01:53] <saml> whoa!
[09:01:54] <shoky> doesn't care what the name is, it's random by default
[09:02:05] <shoky> yes, otherwise jsonp wouldn't work :P
[09:02:21] <shoky> well unless you had your own global function for it
[09:02:28] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[09:02:31] <duch_kazatel> i was about to say :)
[09:02:38] <saml> oh so jquery is doing all sorts of things
[09:02:41] <shoky> hi5
[09:03:17] <saml> if (typeof noneExistingFunction === 'undefined') { window.nonExistingFunction = function.... }   and get rid of that nonExistingFunction after success or error
[09:03:25] <saml> magic
[09:03:30] <duch_kazatel> saml in this case, .done() is hit because the http request was successful.
[09:04:04] <saml> yah but  .done(function(data){ ..}   data is actually proper object, not javascript function call
[09:04:21] <shoky> jquery puts stuff in the global function
[09:04:50] <shoky> er nevermind that
[09:22:12] <BillCriswell> decx: That's my usual approach ( about the layouts ) but I like to keep my HTML thin ( or as thin as drupal let's me )
[09:23:05] <simion314> Hi, I want to setup tooltips on my page http://ploscariu.com/editor4.html  but the X position  is wrong, am I doing something wrong or is a bug ? I am using jquery UI , I tried setting some parameters but the same issue,
[09:25:33] <DeoSama> anyone here done facebook authentication for their app?
[09:25:43] <DeoSama> I have a "unique" situation
[09:26:04] <thebope>         $(placementTable).first(".ad-content-table > tbody > tr.visible-in-mini > td > div > a.text_here").prepend('<i class="fa fa-minus-circle" style="color: red" );
[09:26:27] <thebope> Does anyone know why this would result in an insertion of the i tag above the tbody?
[09:26:39] <thebope> DeoSama, Whats unique about it?
[09:26:58] <DeoSama> well, i'm writing software for business to help them manage themselves
[09:27:06] <DeoSama> they'll have a server to themself and their own URL
[09:27:42] <DeoSama> the software will help them manage appointments, payroll, days off, etc
[09:27:51] <DeoSama> however, i want to allow them to be able to sign in with facebook if they want
[09:27:57] <decx> facebook auth outside of ios is literally hitler
[09:27:59] <DeoSama> (link it to their account)
[09:28:13] <DeoSama> will i be required to register a new app with facebook for every installation?
[09:28:36] <DeoSama> i see i can only have one URL set in my facebook app
[09:28:37] <BillCriswell> simion314: Is there like a CKE ready every or something?
[09:28:49] <DeoSama> so it'll work for one installation, but the second i have 2 installations, it won't work... right?
[09:28:59] <BillCriswell> CKE ready function or something*
[09:29:18] <BillCriswell> thebope: Is your HTML valid?
[09:29:25] <thebope> I believe so BillCriswell
[09:29:36] <thebope> I will plug it into an authenticator and check it out
[09:29:40] <simion314> BillCriswell: yes, there is . you can check in the source for "instanceReady" also the editor is in an iframe could this be the issue?
[09:30:32] <BillCriswell> simion314: I'd try initiating the tooltips there.
[09:31:16] <BillCriswell> thebope: Wait wait wait.
[09:31:28] <BillCriswell> Just noticed you're using .first instead of find.
[09:31:32] <shoky> DeoSama: i can put many urls in my facebook app. oauth redirect URIs. not sure if thats what youre asking about
[09:31:58] <thebope> I'll try with .find
[09:32:07] <thebope> I wanted to ensure it only added to the first one
[09:32:15] <thebope> the very strict path definition should ensure that though I believe
[09:32:29] <DeoSama> shoky: how? I'm only given one spot to do it
[09:32:30] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah, that should get ou closer.
[09:32:34] <DeoSama> "Site URL"
[09:32:54] <BillCriswell> thebope: BAsically, that selector you're passing to first is just going to waste.
[09:33:08] <shoky> DeoSama: heh i don't see that so i guess we're looking at 2 different things
[09:33:25] <thebope> BillCriswell, .first doesn't look for the first matching element?
[09:33:42] <BillCriswell> thebope: Is placementTable a collection of tables and you want the first ".ad-content-table" table in that colleciton?
[09:33:58] <BillCriswell> thebope: It grabs the first matching element from an existing collection.
[09:34:07] <shoky> DeoSama: i'm looking at  Settings->Advanced
[09:34:08] <DeoSama> shoky: can i PM you?
[09:34:12] <thebope> ahh okay that makes sense
[09:34:12] <BillCriswell> It grabs the first element*
[09:34:14] <shoky> ya
[09:34:18] <BillCriswell> Not matching
[09:34:21] <thebope> BillCriswell, yes, there are tables within tables, probably within tables
[09:34:37] <BillCriswell> thebope: Ah ok.
[09:34:39] <decx> 6 layer selector? yikes
[09:34:57] <thebope> decx, normally I wouldn't
[09:35:07] <thebope> decx, but I've been trying to ensure it gets to the right place
[09:35:19] <thebope> since I was confused as to why it prepending up the dom like it is
[09:35:23] <thebope> BillCriswell, yea, it's s hitty
[09:35:40] <decx> when in doubt, add 50kb of classes to the markup ^^
[09:35:41] <thebope> I mean, I guess it works well for what it does. Which is display data.
[09:35:50] <thebope> haha, yea I was thinking that too
[09:36:12] <BillCriswell> thebope: I think you want $(placementTable).find('.ad-content-table').first().find('> tbody > tr.visible-in-mini > td > div > a.text_here')
[09:36:34] <BillCriswell> Or like $(placementTable).find('.ad-content-table:eq(1) > tbody > tr.visible-in-mini > td > div > a.text_here')
[09:37:05] <thebope> BillCriswell, ahh that makes sense to me
[09:37:07] <thebope> I didn't consider that
[09:37:44] <thebope> Let me try it out
[09:38:05] <BillCriswell> At first I thought you were the victim of using .find() when you should have been using .filter()
[09:38:20] <BillCriswell> But nesting tables... haha
[09:39:01] <thebope> Yea, it's a giant web application used internally at our company
[09:39:08] <thebope> it's a total mess
[09:39:21] <BillCriswell> HAha yeah. Totally understood.
[09:40:32] <thebope> It's like when you do school work you can plan out this beautiful application since everything can be preplanned. But when it's a bunch of people all adding to one giant mess of code with no clear road map
[09:41:20] <BillCriswell> You either have to kill everyone or live with the mess.
[09:41:58] <duch_kazatel> nah man just to oo everything.  MVP your CSS, ya dig?
[09:42:08] <duch_kazatel> or MVC your CSS, your pick.
[09:42:17] <decx> somebody hasn't seen enterprise java code
[09:42:33] <BillCriswell> I hear rumors of it. I am thankful I've never seen it.
[09:42:34] <duch_kazatel> oh, i definitely have.  our codebase too closely resembles enterprize fizz buzz.
[09:42:38] <decx> mvp everything!
[09:43:08] <decx> get shit running, polish later
[09:43:51] <thebope> Most viable product and models views controllers?
[09:43:57] <thebope> Minimum viable product I mean
[09:43:58] <BillCriswell> Why is javascript bright ass yellow on github now.
[09:44:05] <BillCriswell> Hurts my peepers.
[09:44:18] <duch_kazatel> thebope model view presenter
[09:44:22] <decx> they changed it the other day, somebody was already complaining in here yesterday
[09:44:38] <decx> i mean minimum viable product though
[09:44:50] <duch_kazatel> that woulda been me, because coldfusion is now bright pink.  our frontend is mostly coldfusion and javascript.  terrible combo.
[09:45:04] <BillCriswell> I don't care about the color change but that yellow is pretty terrible.
[09:45:07] <thebope> terrible
[09:45:22] <duch_kazatel> our java guys are really particular about that codebase.  they'll reject code on the premise that it's not formatted right or it's not consistent with the rest of the design
[09:46:27] <thebope> duch_kazatel, that is a good long term strategy I feel
[09:46:30] <TViernion> morning ALL_PAGE_INPUTS will select all the inputs only, how do i go about selecting all spans, divs and what not?
[09:46:33] <thebope> is your company big?
[09:46:47] <decx> i like the loosely typed nature of js, strongly typed tends to be a religious experience
[09:46:49] <thebope> $("span").each()
[09:46:53] <BillCriswell> TViernion: Anything that's not an input?
[09:47:05] <BillCriswell> Why do you want to do that before I suggest something?
[09:47:15] <TViernion> billcriswell : everything inputs, spans, div, li, p, i,
[09:47:18] <BillCriswell> Why do you want to do that? ( before I suggest something ).
[09:47:28] <duch_kazatel> thebope enough :) we're in the top 5 in our category for ecommerce.
[09:47:42] <BillCriswell> TViernion: You can use $('*')... but why you have to do that I'm nervous.
[09:47:46] <thebope> I forget what the and operator is for and in jquery
[09:47:53] <TViernion> i'm needing to SELECT_ALL.filter(".this_class").mask("this,Format");
[09:47:57] <thebope> duch_kazatel, wow awesome. I wouldn't be surprised if you were close by in NYC
[09:47:58] <BillCriswell> thebope: ,
[09:48:05] <thebope> ahh thanks BillCriswell
[09:48:19] <BillCriswell> TViernion: Why not just $('.this_class') ?
[09:48:34] <duch_kazatel> thebope i am not.  opposite end of the country.
[09:48:56] <BillCriswell> I miss ecommerce.
[09:49:22] <thebope> ecommerce sounds interesting
[09:49:26] <thebope> I'm in advertising
[09:49:31] <thebope> not that my work really relates
[09:49:34] <BillCriswell> thebope: Do not miss that haha.
[09:49:43] <TViernion> so that would filter it just fine?
[09:49:55] <BillCriswell> TViernion: If you want all the .this_class in the whole document yes.
[09:49:57] <thebope> BillCriswell, yea, I'd like to move on one day. I'm thinking about an airline, get cheap flights
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> i used to work with the newspaper industry.  i really like ecommerce though.  lots of interesting stuff.
[09:50:20] <BillCriswell> thebope: Haha. My girlfriend works for a major travel agency so that's a plus.
[09:50:22] <thebope> yea, it'd probably be fun to work for Bloomberg or something even
[09:50:24] <thebope> thats awesome
[09:50:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Agreed!
[09:50:30] <TViernion> what it is.. i've got numbers that I need to make sure are formated as currency with , and .00
[09:50:38] <thebope> travels what I live for. Maybe I can work for a travel company
[09:51:10] <TViernion> but i can't save the values in db that way b/c i'm adding/subtracting/manipulating, and to do such i have to strip those characters out.
[09:51:23] <BillCriswell> We're going to some resort in mexico and for like $150 each we get the flight, hotel and meals and everthing included. I have no idea HOW that works but I don't care.
[09:51:59] <shoky> you might be missing a liver when you get back
[09:52:04] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you're not sitting in any timeshare presos, right?
[09:52:10] <decx> "meals"
[09:52:10] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's useless anyway.
[09:52:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nope. It's basically a free trip, we just pay the taxes.
[09:52:28] <duch_kazatel> good.
[09:52:29] <thebope> wow that's amazing
[09:52:40] <thebope> I just went down to Costa Rica in February
[09:52:43] <thebope> had an absolute blast
[09:52:52] <BillCriswell> We're going to Cancun I think?
[09:52:53] <duch_kazatel> because my wife's family bought us a travel package for our honeymoon and kept talking about what a great deal they got.
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> wound up being a timeshare thing.  really sucked.
[09:53:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's brutal.
[09:53:18] <thebope> yea that is brutal
[09:53:19] <BillCriswell> Can't you politely tell them to fuck off?
[09:53:32] <duch_kazatel> you have to stay for a minimum of x minutes and then you can leave.
[09:53:45] <BillCriswell> I wonder how many people buy with that approach.
[09:53:58] <BillCriswell> Evidently enough if they still use that tactic.
[09:54:00] <duch_kazatel> the first one we didn't know that until after the fact, the second one they stayed under the time limit.  and that whole industry is way weird.
[09:54:08] <thebope> that's really funny. What happens if you leave at x-10 minutes?
[09:54:15] <thebope> yea it is kind of weird
[09:54:21] <thebope> It's a good idea in theory
[09:54:25] <duch_kazatel> they charge you the subsidy they paid for your vacatiuon.
[09:54:32] <duch_kazatel> which usually winds up being WAY more than you'd thing.
[09:54:34] <duch_kazatel> *think.
[09:54:47] <BillCriswell> That blows.
[09:54:59] <duch_kazatel> meh, got us to the bahamas and back.  coulda been worse.
[09:59:06] <TViernion> billcriswell : $( ".money_mask").mask("999,999,999.00");  something like this
[10:01:00] <BillCriswell> TViernion: I'm sorry I got sidetracked.
[10:01:22] <TViernion> No worries...
[10:02:40] <TViernion> and what i have will not work.. lol... it's for masked input plugin for jquery... not what im looking to do
[10:02:43] * TViernion sighs
[10:12:34] <duch_kazatel> who the fuck sets an inline style of "display: none;" and then runs .hide() on a selector for that class?!
[10:12:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Cool kids.
[10:13:26] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:14:07] <BillCriswell> .pane-nodequeue-5-panel-pane-1
[10:14:10] <BillCriswell> i love these class names.
[10:14:20] <duch_kazatel> woah that's beautifuyl.
[10:15:38] <BillCriswell> That margin / padding thing was worth today.
[10:15:49] <duch_kazatel> that alone was p. neat.
[10:21:08] <decx> $('[style*="display:none"]').show() ^^
[10:21:22] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[10:24:20] <BillCriswell> "How long have you worked with UI?"
[10:24:21] <Shero> how do I add a settimeout for $('#class').load(window.location.href);
[10:24:21] <BillCriswell> What?
[10:24:38] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[10:25:03] <BillCriswell> Shero: $(function() { setTimeout(function() { $('#class').load(window.location.href); }, 1000); });
[10:25:13] <duch_kazatel> no but really why would you do that?
[10:25:19] <BillCriswell> Shero: Are you creating inception?
[10:25:19] <duch_kazatel> you're loading the page... into itself?
[10:26:07] <BillCriswell> I wonder how many years I've been doing jQuery.
[10:26:11] <Shero> Thanks, What do you mean by inception, I am reloading a tag
[10:26:29] <duch_kazatel> window.location.href is the page.
[10:26:35] <BillCriswell> window.location.href is the url of the page you're on.
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> you're saying "put the current page into #class
[10:26:47] <duch_kazatel> also: #class lol
[10:26:50] <duch_kazatel> .id
[10:27:07] <decx> [tag]
[10:27:07] <Velveeta_> bill: tell them you've been working with UI's your entire life
[10:27:16] <Velveeta_> from the first time you laid hands on an apple IIe
[10:27:18] <Shero> but if I did $('#id').load(window.location.href);, it reloads the tag with that id
[10:27:30] <Velveeta_> make sure you tell them that was a suboptimal UI so they know you mean business
[10:27:39] <duch_kazatel> Shero wat
[10:27:49] <BillCriswell> Velveeta_: Exactly hah
[10:28:06] <BillCriswell> That was the first question on this email I'm thinking about replying to as a joke.
[10:28:19] <BillCriswell> UI: 3 years, HTML: 11 years.
[10:28:21] <duch_kazatel> Shero that syntax of .load() places the ajax'd content into the targeted element.
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell flip those.  UI 11 years.  html 3 years.  css 7 years.
[10:28:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It is a joke.
[10:29:03] <Shero> you are right duch_kazatel
[10:29:05] <duch_kazatel> i know.  that's why you craft really bizarre amounts.
[10:29:07] <Shero> Thanks
[10:29:09] <BillCriswell> jQuery: 8 years, Javascript: 5 years.
[10:29:15] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[10:29:26] <duch_kazatel> also: you are a social media guru now.
[10:29:35] <Velveeta_> well if you're gonna reply as a joke, make sure to have some fun with it... go off on some tangents like grampa simpson would... "i've been working with UI for the past 3 years, and let me tell you something about UI... that reminds me of the time i was talking about user interfaces with an old colleague of mine.. i was wearing an onion on my belt, as that was the fashion at the time......"
[10:29:36] <BillCriswell> Ick.
[10:29:57] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta_++
[10:31:01] <decx> i used to be in IT, but then they changed what IT was, now what's im with isn't IT and what's IT seems weird and scary to me, it'll happen to you
[10:31:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[10:32:07] <Velveeta_> very nice :D
[10:47:01] <decx> gotta be up there as one of my favorite simpsons quotes
[10:47:18] <gordian> please come again
[10:47:25] <BillCriswell> Abortions for some... miniature American flags for everyone!
[10:47:42] <decx> As a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But tonight I say, we must move forward, not backward, upward not forward, and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom
[10:49:28] <duch_kazatel> i was always a fan of "cromulent"
[10:50:35] <duch_kazatel> also: i am now listening to price.  this day is awesome.
[10:50:46] <duch_kazatel> *prince
[10:51:07] <marc_online_> good evening
[10:51:15] <duch_kazatel> good morning!
[10:51:29] <marc_online_> ;-)
[10:51:31] <BillCriswell> Afternoon.
[10:52:05] <marc_online_> different timezones i see.
[10:52:16] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:52:21] <duch_kazatel> you're, what, western europe?
[10:52:29] <marc_online_> the netherlands
[10:52:33] <duch_kazatel> ah, neat.
[10:52:56] <greendot> land of joints:D
[10:53:05] <greendot> not for long I think
[10:53:58] <marc_online_> sorry not my thing
[10:54:29] <decx> my swatch says it's 790 beats
[10:54:36] <decx> said no one ever
[10:54:42] <greendot> sure, Im not refering to you, its just a fact
[10:56:55] <duch_kazatel> welp since the room is dead: anybody got fun plans for the weekend?
[10:57:15] <Xal_> If I wanted to take a list of elements and wrap sections of that list in containers, how would I do that?
[10:57:59] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery wrap
[10:58:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .wrap() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[10:58:01] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery wrapInner
[10:58:05] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .wrapInner() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[10:58:39] <decx> so you want to take an element that has say 10 children, and wrap children 4-8 inside another container?
[10:58:50] <Xal_> Basically
[10:59:18] <BillCriswell> $('div').slice(4,8).wrapInner('<div>') mayhaps?
[10:59:19] <decx> why not just change the html beforehand
[10:59:26] <|RicharD|> hi
[10:59:38] <Xal_> Because it's being generated by a .NET control
[11:00:17] <decx> so how do you plan to identify the children that are supposed to be grouped?
[11:00:37] <erming> webforms, how fun
[11:01:27] <thebope> I;m a little late but #class cracked me up
[11:01:34] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:02:11] <thebope> thats some nifty jquery BillCriswell
[11:02:27] <decx> you laugh, but bootstrap actually named its grid classes span at one point
[11:02:39] <BillCriswell> thebope: jQuery does all the nifty.
[11:04:20] <Brycetron> @duch_kazatel hey !
[11:04:23] <thebope> BillCriswell, I should explore the inner workings some day. I only ever see the minified version, which also crops up in debugger nightmares
[11:04:41] <duch_kazatel> whuddup Brycetron
[11:04:59] <BillCriswell> thebope: Haha true. You just pick up things over time like everything else.
[11:05:15] <duch_kazatel> thebope you should lean everything the jQuery function call can do.
[11:05:27] <thebope> I'd like to
[11:05:29] <duch_kazatel> *learn
[11:05:33] <|RicharD|> How I can do a "validation" of a prompt without open 20000 alert ? :D
[11:05:34] <|RicharD|> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5d483758964928ab4628
[11:05:37] <duch_kazatel> because $() alone is neat.
[11:05:53] <duch_kazatel> ew coffeescript
[11:06:14] <|RicharD|> I want that if I click on ok it don't do nothing if the field is empty
[11:06:20] <|RicharD|> so it stay open
[11:06:33] <thebope> I've a ton of sweet books to go through this summer: Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja,, Pro Angular JS, Web Application Hackers Handbook, and Code Complete 2
[11:06:37] <thebope> that's the goal. Since I won'
[11:06:39] <Xal_> decx, by how many there are in total. That split function is exactly what I need.
[11:06:40] <thebope> t have any grad school work
[11:06:50] <Xal_> slice, rather
[11:07:15] <BillCriswell> thebope: I'm teaching myself angular at night. It's a lot to get used to.
[11:07:17] <BillCriswell> A whole lot.
[11:07:29] <thebope> I'm thinking Code Complete > Secrets of a JavaScript Ninja > Pro Angular > Web Application Hackers Handbook
[11:07:32] <thebope> yea thats what I hear BillCriswell
[11:07:55] <duch_kazatel> and JavaScript: The Definitive Guide > all others in some ways.
[11:08:18] <thebope> oh I was using it like an indicator of reading progression
[11:08:21] <thebope> as opposed to a greater than
[11:08:25] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[11:08:27] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[11:08:36] <thebope> Oh! I forgot the last step
[11:08:41] <thebope> > ask for a raise
[11:08:41] <duch_kazatel> i still haven't read code complete.
[11:09:10] <thebope> Everyone raves about it, so when I needed to complete my collection of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novels I saw it on Amazon for 30 bucks and thought what the hey
[11:09:28] <Velveeta_> thebope: you also forgot the first step: show everybody where to grab these ebooks for free >
[11:09:47] <thebope> just got it today and my boss walks over 10 minutes after the package arrived and says "This just got in from israel, you should read it" and hands me a copy of Code Complete
[11:10:19] <thebope> Velveeta_, Eh, I like buying the real books to support the authors (even if its just a little), and just to have the real books
[11:10:24] <thebope> So I actually wouldn't know
[11:10:38] <Velveeta_> well damn... now i have to expend effort :D
[11:10:56] <thebope> ;-)
[11:11:02] <duch_kazatel> my company pays for safari books, so i can get all those for free through that.
[11:11:08] <thebope> thats awesome
[11:11:36] <thebope> duch_kazatel, those are ebooks only?
[11:11:59] <thebope> A company I was considering trying to apply for offered to buy me any book if I was hired from Amazon for free
[11:12:02] <thebope> it's like a dream
[11:12:03] <duch_kazatel> thebope safari does ebooks only, but yeah.
[11:12:07] <thebope> that and free plane tickets
[11:16:30] <thebope> I'm excited for Code Complete. I hear it's pretty much the penultimate coding book
[11:30:43] <thebope> Is there anyway to detect change in an input where only the text in the input changes but not the value?
[11:30:53] <thebope> it must be some particular quirk of the jquery date time picker I'm using
[11:31:14] <thebope> but it doesn't update the value of the input when the value is changed
[11:31:18] <Thoams> .on('keydown', function() { })
[11:31:40] <Thoams> show code
[11:31:44] <Thoams> no can psychic
[11:32:02] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[11:32:10] <decx> input
[11:32:22] <BillCriswell>  thebope: The text changes but not the value?
[11:32:25] <decx> the event is literally called input
[11:32:25] <Thoams> need iiiinpuuut!
[11:32:37] <Thoams> ten points to name that film
[11:32:39] <thebope> I tried oninput
[11:32:47] <duch_kazatel> .on('input'
[11:32:50] <thebope> Thoams, unfortunately it's not keydown
[11:32:54] <thebope> okay I'll try input
[11:32:54] <Thoams> ack
[11:33:10] <decx> well keydown in that context should work just as well
[11:33:23] <Thoams> I'd rather be wrong and corrected than wrong and ignorant
[11:33:23] <thebope> decx, it detects text insertions?
[11:33:27] * Thoams guessed
[11:34:57] <thebope> hmm not working
[11:34:58] <thebope> damn
[11:35:07] <thebope> Doesn't even get into the loop on my debugger
[11:35:57] <BillCriswell> thebope: Can you make a small demo at jsbin of what you're trying to do
[11:36:14] <BillCriswell> thebope: Usually people figure out what they're going for after isolating things like that.
[11:36:28] <thebope> BillCriswell, yea I'll try
[11:36:32] <ankurk_> Is there a way I can store the success response in Ajax?
[11:36:34] <thebope> I can import a library
[11:36:45] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ to call it outside of the function?
[11:36:45] <ankurk_> in a Global variable perhaps?
[11:36:52] <ankurk_> yep
[11:36:59] <ankurk_> calling it outside of function
[11:37:03] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a best way to implement a conditional event?
[11:37:06] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ you have to create a globally available var and then set it inside the success callback, but i'd avoid doing that if at all possible.
[11:37:14] <DeltaHeavy> Right now I'm just looking at this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12485085/prevent-scrolling-on-mobile-browser-without-preventing-input-focusing
[11:37:14] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy whosawhat
[11:37:27] <duch_kazatel> aaah.
[11:37:43] <ankurk_> Why should I avoid it?
[11:37:54] <duch_kazatel> because globals are bad, mkay?
[11:38:02] <thebope> they pollute your dom, no?
[11:38:14] <decx> thebope http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4WTEz/
[11:38:15] <duch_kazatel> they pollute the global namespace and make things harder to maintain later.
[11:38:18] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: You can't guarantee when it'll be ready.
[11:38:19] <marc_online_> .
[11:38:27] <duch_kazatel> also race conditions in this case.
[11:39:02] <BillCriswell> I always win the race.
[11:39:28] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ i did something like that in a recent project because i had to hack to get it done.  i thought "nah it'll be okay in this one case".
[11:39:33] <duch_kazatel> i regret the decision.
[11:40:15] <ankurk_> This just came to my mind, can we use Closures in this case?
[11:40:47] <duch_kazatel> sure can :) wrap a closure around everything and go to down.  still not a solution for the race condition issues, but that gets you a step in the right direction.
[11:40:55] <duch_kazatel> *go to town
[11:41:02] <Xal_> BillCrisswell. Thanks. That slice function worked. Although it was wrapAll, not wrapInner.
[11:41:53] <ankurk_> thanks duch_kazatel, BillCriswell, you're my heroes :D
[11:42:14] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ pffft.  naaaah.
[11:43:01] <thebope> Alright, trying to put this on jsbin or fiddle is being a total pain
[11:43:11] <thebope> I'm going to get lunch
[11:43:12] <thebope> ;-)
[11:43:42] <thebope>  Thanks though duch_kazatel Thoams BillCriswell decx
[11:43:58] <thebope> I shall return!
[11:44:28] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[11:44:46] <duch_kazatel> s'what we do!
[11:45:03] <duch_kazatel> one of these days, i'm going to forget one of my little placeholders and QA and CR won't catch it and a customer is going to see something like <h1>MAXIMUM BUTTS</h1> flash accross their screen.
[11:47:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: AS long as they never see it again they can't prove it.
[11:48:02] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:50:08] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Didn't see your reply. Ended up just putting an if statement in my event - https://www.refheap.com/79835
[11:50:50] <BillCriswell> I didn't realize that was your question. I would have looked at it lol
[11:52:01] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy ah. yeah that's the gist.
[11:52:31] <DeltaHeavy> I thought it was probably preferred to have an event toggle on/off for performance.
[11:52:36] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:52:47] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, figured I was going about it wrong. This is ez
[11:52:58] <duch_kazatel> the overhead of adding/removing is probably greater than filtering like that.
[11:53:03] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, true
[11:53:27] <Thoams> anyone au fait with tooltips?
[11:54:09] <duch_kazatel> Thoams hrm?
[11:54:33] <Thoams> I've got a bunch of rows, each have an icon which reveals a tooltip which loads content via ajax. If you skim the cursor over more than maybe three of them, or if you purposefully muck about with them, the tooltips fail to close
[11:55:03] <Thoams> suspected that it might be mouseout events not firing, added setTimeout(...tooltip('close')...)
[11:55:07] <Thoams> no joy
[11:55:33] <DeltaHeavy> Sounds like it would be better implemented in CSS than JS/jQuery.
[11:56:03] <Thoams> you'd rather I somehow listened to mouseevents with css
[11:56:07] <Thoams> and ajax in content
[11:56:08] <Thoams> with css
[11:56:11] <Thoams> than use jqueryui.
[11:56:15] <Thoams> ?
[11:56:34] <Thoams> the tooltips aren't closing; they should
[11:56:36] <DeltaHeavy> Thoams: When it comes to the part of things appearing/disappearing.
[11:56:52] <DeltaHeavy> Should just be toggling a class on and off the tooltip I'd think.
[11:57:17] <Thoams> I agree with the 'solve a different problem' approach, sure
[11:57:21] <duch_kazatel> Thoams do you have a fiddle to share?
[11:57:23] <Thoams> but I'd like to solve the one at hand
[11:57:32] <Thoams> not yet
[11:57:34] <Thoams> hang on
[11:57:56] <DeltaHeavy> It's the same problem, I just think you should go about it in a different way.
[11:58:08] <duch_kazatel> Thoams it sounds like you're running into a race condition.  you're not like "toggling" things, right?  your'a dding/removing them explicitly.
[12:00:39] <Voyage> hi
[12:00:49] <Voyage> tool tip not working. any clue? http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/
[12:01:25] <duch_kazatel> Voyage you don't have jqui in that fiddle.
[12:02:38] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  cant find that. else than normal jquery
[12:02:46] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  cant find that option. else than normal jquery
[12:03:51] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/3/
[12:04:10] <decx> it shows up if you choose jquery 191 or 202
[12:05:19] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  why dont I get the UI option with jquery 1.10
[12:05:27] <decx> wait what, why are you binding that on mouseover?
[12:05:48] <decx> you just bind it, it tooltip has its own mouseenter leave/out binds
[12:06:01] <decx> jq*
[12:06:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah just bind once.
[12:07:03] <Voyage> the problem with this http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/4/ is that when the text is mouse overred fast. some tooltips gets closed and others dont. why is that and any fix to this?
[12:07:41] <decx> you're rebinding a few hundred times like this so yeah
[12:07:47] <decx> get rid of the document mouseover
[12:08:33] <decx> in the background the tooltip() functions attaches event handlers to your selector already so there's no need for it
[12:08:57] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/5/
[12:09:04] <Voyage> nevermind, it was because of .on
[12:09:28] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  oh . thanks
[12:10:50] <Thoams> well now the damned fiddle is giving me a different problem
[12:11:03] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[12:11:16] <Thoams> give me a minute more.
[12:15:45] <Thoams> oh, the humanity.
[12:15:53] <Thoams> right the fiddle works perfectly
[12:16:05] <BillCriswell> Thoams: That happens all the time.
[12:16:08] <duch_kazatel> :) so what makes it different from your site?
[12:16:12] <BillCriswell> It's why we suggest it.
[12:16:18] <Thoams> the duration loading the content via ajax
[12:16:20] <Thoams> the handlers
[12:16:22] <Windy> i don't suppose anyone could tell me what one would call this type of UI element: http://imgur.com/UkeNOGT ?
[12:16:27] <Thoams> argh.
[12:16:40] <duch_kazatel> Windy a 404 page
[12:16:51] <Windy> wt?
[12:16:52] <Windy> really
[12:16:52] <BillCriswell> I'd just call it a dropdown.
[12:17:11] <Windy> BillCriswell: except choosing the drop down element changes the action and appearance of the button element
[12:17:13] <duch_kazatel> http://imgur.com/UkeNOGT that looks like a 404 to me.  or an error.
[12:17:22] <Thoams> it could potentially be a multiple select combobox
[12:17:23] <duch_kazatel> ooooh wtf.
[12:17:29] <duch_kazatel> i was getting an actual 404 from imgur on that one lol
[12:17:31] <Thoams> if you're able to tick as many as you like
[12:17:31] <BillCriswell> Windy: So a very custom select box.
[12:17:37] * Thoams throws a spanner in the works.
[12:17:43] <duch_kazatel> that looks like a bootstrap dropdown, windy
[12:17:49] <Windy> Thoams: combobox is close, but that seems to be what you call text boxes
[12:17:49] <BillCriswell> A very custom multiple select lol
[12:17:51] <duch_kazatel> Thoams wait ajax?
[12:18:00] <Thoams> I will not await ajax
[12:18:00] <Windy> BillCriswell: supposing you can only select one
[12:18:06] <Thoams> unless I have to
[12:18:08] <Windy> duch_kazatel: it might be bootstrap.  it's from tumblr
[12:18:08] <Thoams> :|
[12:18:18] <Thoams> yes, ajaxing in content for tooltips
[12:18:27] <Thoams> loading extra information about a given record on demand
[12:18:29] <Windy> i just figured there was a name for a button with a drop down which changed the action and appearance of the button
[12:18:59] <BillCriswell> Windy: It's kind of a weird pattern now that i think about it.
[12:19:13] <Thoams> ended up being the best way of giving the user the option to view that sort of tertiary data about a given thing
[12:19:46] <BillCriswell> Windy: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-dropdowns-split might get you started
[12:19:48] <Thoams> but... the problem is that you can muck about with the 'info' icons and the tooltips all load up and never get their mouseout events
[12:20:25] <Windy> BillCriswell: yeah, i can see how i could create it with that for sure.  i guess i thought there'd be a name for it.
[12:20:34] <Windy> i suppose it shall henceforth be known as a ComboButton ;)
[12:20:45] <Windy> thanks!
[12:20:49] <BillCriswell> Just used "font-color"... Why isn't that real?
[12:21:03] <Windy> because just color
[12:21:19] <duch_kazatel> but why not font-color for consistency with every other font property?
[12:21:24] <BillCriswell> I know that, but font-color seems more logical.
[12:21:27] <decx> because there is no consistency there
[12:21:29] <Windy> true
[12:21:30] <Windy> heh
[12:21:44] <duch_kazatel> font-size, font-family, font-color feels natural.
[12:22:04] <decx> text-transform, text-decoration
[12:22:18] <BillCriswell> I know color will also set a border color as well and there's "border-color"
[12:22:21] <BillCriswell> so it's just weird.
[12:22:32] <duch_kazatel> right?
[12:22:47] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  the reason  I used the .on was because I also make new divs with .task class by DOM manipulation at run time. so where should I place the .tooltip jquery script?
[12:23:18] <duch_kazatel> Voyage after your manipulation.
[12:23:44] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  well that would go for each manipulation. too non-tidy. isnt there a generic or better approach?

[12:24:35] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  how about $(".task").on('mouseover', '.task', function(e) {    innstead of  $(document).on('mouseover', '.task', function(e) {
[12:24:36] <decx> again with the mouseover, come on
[12:24:52] <duch_kazatel> Voyage no.
[12:25:00] <duch_kazatel> Voyage that is going to have the exact same problem as before.
[12:25:15] <Voyage> then any other solution/
[12:25:17] <Voyage> ?
[12:26:16] <duch_kazatel> Voyage init after you manipulate the dom?
[12:26:23] <duch_kazatel> how much manipulation are we talking about?
[12:26:47] <Voyage> many
[12:27:09] <duch_kazatel> not helpful.
[12:27:22] <duch_kazatel> this some kind of dynamic thing?  could it be done server-side instead?
[12:27:23] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[12:27:28] <Voyage> that was the reason I was asking for alternatives
[12:27:31] <Voyage> yes
[12:27:35] <Voyage> dynamic
[12:27:38] <Voyage> serverside. no
[12:28:04] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need to find a way to keep track of what's been initialized and init the new ones after they've been loaded.
[12:28:12] <duch_kazatel> using an .on() is not the right way to do this.
[12:29:38] <Voyage> k
[12:30:14] <Voyage> so after every dom is created. I should do $(this).tooltip?
[12:30:28] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it, sure.
[12:30:36] <duch_kazatel> and you mean "element".
[12:30:54] <adrian_lc> hello, I'm trying to use <br/> inside the content of my jquery ui tooltip but it's escaping the tags somewhere
[12:31:20] <duch_kazatel> we're getting a lot of JQUI tooltip questions today.
[12:31:26] <adrian_lc> content: function() { return $(this).siblings('.helptext').html();  }
[12:31:32] <adrian_lc> that's my content option
[12:31:44] <duch_kazatel> adrian_lc could you setup a working example on jsfiddle?
[12:32:02] <Voyage> adrian_lc,  http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/5/
[12:32:07] <adrian_lc> duch_kazatel, sure, 1 min
[12:32:32] <duch_kazatel> Voyage that doesn't help them :V
[12:33:03] <blindMoe> adrian_lc: seems to work fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/6/
[12:33:08] <Voyage> here it is adrian_lc  http://jsfiddle.net/u3mrQ/7/
[12:33:22] <Voyage> with br^
[12:33:49] <wa5ted> hey guys
[12:34:17] <wa5ted> i need to make some text that is apart of the same paragraph on new lines
[12:34:18] <decx> also works fine here adrian_lc http://jsfiddle.net/decx/u3mrQ/8/
[12:34:19] <wa5ted> reaosn
[12:34:25] <wa5ted> the container that i need them in is a cirlce
[12:34:30] <wa5ted> so i though of 2 solutions
[12:34:43] <adrian_lc> ouch, it's escaped server side
[12:34:51] <adrian_lc> sorry
[12:34:54] <decx> hehe
[12:35:04] <wa5ted> 1. some how make the text align to the inside of the circle (which i dont know how to do and would like guidance in) 2. use <br> where needed
[12:35:18] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted text-align: center.
[12:35:31] <wa5ted> ^which of the 2 should i use, and if 2. is that bad practice to use <br> in the middle of a para graph
[12:35:34] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: i did that
[12:35:40] <adrian_lc> thanks everyone, apologies
[12:35:44] <wa5ted> but my container  is a circle
[12:35:50] <wa5ted> i need all the content to fit inside that
[12:36:04] <wa5ted> so i guess ill hae to use <p> with inserted <br> where i need them
[12:36:05] <blindMoe> adrian_lc: you owe all of us a sandwich .. and by all of us I mean Voyage and I
[12:36:06] <blindMoe> ;)
[12:36:07] <decx> there's a reason you only see this style rarely, it's a neigh impossible task
[12:36:12] <wa5ted> unless i can make the circle the container some how
[12:36:17] <wa5ted> instead of the rectangle that ti is
[12:36:19] <wa5ted> it is
[12:36:49] <stlstude> Can someone help a n00b out if they have a moment and tell me why I can't seem to get the value from my slider and input it in the 'number of units managed' box beneath it? http://jsfiddle.net/lstude/Shm4Y/1/   I tried .keyup() to no avail
[12:38:11] <factorial> hello everyone - if my script does foo = jQuery(domElement); bar = jQuery(domElement); are foo and bar the exact same in-memory object? or are they two objects that both represent the same DOM element?
[12:38:32] <duch_kazatel> two objects that are copies of a dom element.
[12:39:05] <BillCriswell> factorial: You'd have to do foo[0] === bar[0] to compare the two dom elements.
[12:39:52] <factorial> tyvm. a coworker's script does jQuery(this).method().chain(); repeatedly and I think it should instead be var x = jQuery(this); then methods on x.
[12:40:17] <decx> yes
[12:40:18] <factorial> otherwise it seems the script would use up considerably more memory with every call to jQuery(this)
[12:40:21] <BillCriswell> factorial: Agreed.
[12:40:23] <decx> it does
[12:40:29] <factorial> thank you all, much appreciated
[12:40:35] <decx> maybe not considerable, but it is
[12:40:56] <duch_kazatel> factorial that's exactly what it does.
[12:48:31] <Ownix> decx: collision detection! http://jsfiddle.net/BZxjC/9/
[12:48:54] <Ownix> Im still working on an explosion, but I think I need to use a counter because anything I do in that loop happens a bunch of times in a row
[12:53:47] <blindMoe> if I am doing a selection like so: var $fooBars = $("div[id^='foo_bar_']"); is it possible to add to that selection to have it not select a particular element that has an id of something like: foo_bar_selected  ?
[12:53:56] <blindMoe> not sure how to exclude a particular one from a broad selector
[12:54:54] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Probably want to use filter.
[12:55:08] <blindMoe> k thanks BillCriswell
[12:55:32] <BillCriswell> I feel like selected should be a class though. Feel like there might be better ways to approach what you're trying to do.
[12:55:51] <blindMoe> it isn't actually 'selected' .. it is a list of products with their ids appended
[12:56:02] <blindMoe> there is definitely probably a better way to do it :)
[12:56:16] <BillCriswell> Why don't the elements have a .product class on them or something?
[12:56:19] <blindMoe> just doing a quick fix on some code someone else wrote that had a crappy accordion setup using inline js
[12:56:23] <wa5ted> hi guys i have this http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/8TPPm/1/ <--- the issue is that the text is not center aligned
[12:56:30] <wa5ted> vertically centered any ideas
[12:56:31] <BillCriswell> Then you could do things like $('.product').not('.selected')
[12:57:00] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: true .. I may switch it up but was more just not trying to change any of their markup or classes
[12:57:12] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: You could actually use .not for what you have there now that I think about it.
[12:57:26] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: ahh I totally forgot about .not
[12:57:28] <BillCriswell> $("div[id^='foo_bar_']").not('#foo_bar_selected')
[12:57:30] <wa5ted> also i dont know if its just me but there seems to be some lag when hover there is lag
[12:57:41] <wa5ted> maybe its casue im using opactiy
[12:59:36] <wa5ted> anyideas?
[12:59:46] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted i'm not seeing lag.
[12:59:57] <stlstude> this is a repost but I can't seem to get the value from my slider and input it in the 'number of units managed' box beneath it. What am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/lstude/Shm4Y/1/
[13:00:24] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: maybe its my side, the second issue is the vertical centering text
[13:00:53] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted does it need to be dynamic?
[13:01:28] <wa5ted> yes
[13:01:31] <wa5ted> preferably
[13:01:36] <wa5ted> its not a template
[13:01:52] <wa5ted> but i mean i have other cirlces like this one
[13:01:53] <duch_kazatel> also: you can't put div's inside of a tags unless the a is block level.
[13:01:56] <wa5ted> that have difetntext
[13:02:05] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: sry what?
[13:02:37] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do this: <a><div></div></a>
[13:02:40] <duch_kazatel> that is not valid code.
[13:03:13] <wa5ted> unless.....
[13:03:21] <duch_kazatel> you set display: block; on the <a>
[13:03:32] <duch_kazatel> and even then it's a little funky.
[13:03:45] <wa5ted> whys that
[13:03:50] <wa5ted> i mena i get the desired behavious
[13:03:56] <wa5ted> which is that the entire overlay is a link
[13:04:09] <duch_kazatel> because you can't have block-level elements inside of inline elements.
[13:04:21] <duch_kazatel> the browser is laying out based on what it thinks you might mean.
[13:05:01] <duch_kazatel> http://davidwalsh.name/css-vertical-center for help on the vertical alignment.

[13:12:13] <Getty> BillCriswell: haha funny, nice idea, reminds me of the excel exchange many companies did for website design exchanges
[13:12:42] <Getty> BillCriswell: like filling fields with colors to show what area should be used for what and what flow exists even, as you could made links to other excel pages behind that

[13:44:45] <drej> ie without a constant check while scrolling
[13:44:50] <JohnFP> can't anyone helpp?
[13:45:02] <drej> like endless scroll but without having a constant scroll event checking

[13:46:01] <duch_kazatel> does that help?
[13:46:18] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: It should be the x-axis.

[13:47:12] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: But I only can define the minimum Interval of the x-axis once
[13:47:25] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: do you know what I mean my friend?
[13:47:39] <duch_kazatel> JohnFP i don't use highcharts, so nope.
[13:48:18] <JohnFP> I really begin to hate highcharts people. That is so stupid not to provide such an option for dates..
[13:50:37] <JohnFP> nobody who uses / knows "Highcharts"?
[13:50:48] <jphase> I've used them tons :\
[13:50:49] <duch_kazatel> could you share some code, JohnFP?
[13:50:59] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: sure

[13:59:30] <duch_kazatel> JohnFP btw you can't use html comments in javascript.
[14:00:10] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: That's not the main problem at the moment.. :)
[14:01:02] <duch_kazatel> having invalid js is going to cause issues though ;)
[14:02:57] <JohnFP> duch_kazatel: good night :)
[14:03:47] <duch_kazatel> welp

[14:28:06] <nisseni> I'm trying to make a post: http://pastie.org/private/vnp8kogatxkvftlwqw1vsa - I get an empty return. If I make a var_dump from the php file I do get the response in the log
[14:30:49] <ezrafree> hello all
[14:31:05] <ezrafree> is it possible to get the value of the href attribute of an h3 tag?
[14:31:20] <ezrafree> i have markup such as <h3 href="#">
[14:31:30] <decx> invalid
[14:31:35] <ezrafree> correct
[14:31:42] <Getty> what? invalid or correct?
[14:31:44] <Getty> LOL
[14:31:55] <ezrafree> my question then i guess, is, can i get this value even though its invalid markup?
[14:32:11] <Getty> ezrafree: you dont want invalid markup, period
[14:32:25] <ezrafree> that doesn't answer my question (and i already knew that)
[14:32:26] <nisseni> ezrafree: $('#h3Id').attr('href') ?
[14:32:26] <Getty> ezrafree: as the information might be just.... not there, ever, no matter what you do, the browser might just simple ignore it
[14:32:48] <Getty> you must test it with every possible thing you wanna do on every possible browser
[14:32:57] <Getty> then you can do it like nisseni said, of course, thats just logical the same
[14:33:20] <ezrafree> but can jquery get the value of an h3 tag's href attribute? yes or no
[14:33:25] <ezrafree> like, is it possible?
[14:33:39] <nisseni> ezrafree: did you try my suggestion?
[14:33:39] <Getty> ezrafree: theoretical jquery has no switches internally for that
[14:33:59] <Getty> ezrafree: it just does it, it gives it through to the base js functions that the call requires, it doesnt care if you call is valid or not
[14:34:00] <decx> what's stopping you from testing it? :>
[14:34:06] <Getty> jquery has literally nothing todo with it
[14:34:22] <ezrafree> nisseni: i didn't, i could've wrote it that way from the beginning but my question has to do with "why" i am getting returned "undefined" when i try to do this
[14:34:33] <ezrafree> Getty: a dom limitation then?
[14:34:43] <duch_kazatel> because the DOM likely doesn't support href on H3s
[14:34:46] <Getty> ezrafree: yeah it could be that the browser just ignores that tag in the HTML
[14:34:51] <nisseni> ezrafree: did you post any code?
[14:34:53] <blindMoe> is the $.cookie() plugin considered the best to use for cookie getting/setting ?
[14:34:57] <Getty> ezrafree: you dont know, it might be so evil that you think it works but it doesnt work in SOME cases
[14:35:01] <ezrafree> nisseni: did you read the scroll?
[14:35:02] <Getty> ezrafree: you dont know, you will never know ;)
[14:36:42] <nisseni> ezrafree: nope
[14:37:02] <nisseni> I'm trying to make a post: http://pastie.org/private/vnp8kogatxkvftlwqw1vsa - I get an empty return. If I make a var_dump from the php file I do get the response in the log
[14:37:58] <Thoams> do you have control of the endpoint; have you tried traditional: true
[14:38:21] <Thoams> by that I mean fully forming an $.ajax({}); call instead of the shorthand .post
[14:38:57] <duch_kazatel> btw nisseni don't use new Array.
[14:39:01] <duch_kazatel> use an array literal instead.
[14:40:29] <nisseni> Thoams: nope, will try that
[14:44:48] <nisseni> Thoams: same empty result
[14:45:53] <Thoams> are you in control of the target of the post
[14:46:47] <Thoams> actually more importantly have you inspected the xmlhttprequest that your browser generates
[14:47:14] <Thoams> you might see an empty response because the response is coming in a form that you're not catering for in code
[14:48:06] <Thoams> if an internal server error has been caused, for example, you may well miss it if you're expecting to output 'result.TextProperty'
[14:49:05] <Thoams> paste something if you can
[14:50:00] <Thoams> ^ in a form - form wasn't the best word to use... in a shape. an object.
[14:51:01] <hocza> Is there an easier way with bootsrap carousel to check which Item is active than $('#c-slide.item.active') ?
[14:51:16] <nisseni> Thoams: it comes from a plain php-file
[14:51:33] <zorak8> hi, i want to implement this to a webpage im doing in ruby on rails
[14:51:34] <zorak8> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[14:51:35] <Thoams> which you have written?
[14:52:03] <zorak8> i have 0 experience with jquery and javascript, already installa the requirments
[14:52:10] <ezrafree> hocza: it doesn't get much easier than that...
[14:52:27] <ezrafree> hocza: did you have any specific method in mind?
[14:52:29] <zorak8> and i don now where or how put the code of the examples to the page
[14:52:50] <nisseni> Thoams: yes
[14:53:00] <hocza> yeah, maybe a $carousel.currentItem
[14:53:02] <hocza> :)
[14:53:03] <Thoams> zorak8: I'm not saying you'll not find an answer here, but also ask in #RubyOnRails
[14:53:22] <zorak8> #rubyonrails send me here
[14:53:33] <Thoams> try typing "/join #rubyonrails"
[14:53:44] <Thoams> if you're using a web based client it might not work
[14:53:55] <duch_kazatel> Thoams they said that roiom send them here...
[14:54:01] <Thoams> oh.
[14:54:21] <duch_kazatel> zorak8 iirc rails has some kind of asset pipeline you have to include things in.
[14:54:22] <ezrafree> oh i've used that timepicker before, it was quite gnarly if memory serves
[14:54:23] <Thoams> then I'm out of ideas, sorry dude
[14:54:26] <Thoams> rails is mad
[14:54:49] <Thoams> do it again in something .net
[14:54:59] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:55:01] <duch_kazatel> or node.
[14:55:07] <Thoams> or three.js
[14:55:12] <Thoams> I'd pay you to do it in three.js
[14:55:13] <Thoams> :D
[14:55:14] <duch_kazatel> or or or.
[14:55:15] <duch_kazatel> tons of options.\
[14:55:22] <Thoams> not all of them 3D ;)
[14:55:36] <Thoams> there's a javascript lib for the leap motion device
[14:55:39] <Thoams> it's AWESOME
[14:55:41] <Thoams> anyway
[14:55:56] <nisseni> Thoams: http://pastie.org/private/dra9dfitencyxnzifz6ww - not sure which contentType and dataType I should be using
[14:56:00] <Thoams> nisseni: can you post both your form and the php page that you're pasting to?
[14:56:00] <hocza> ezrafree: oh i did it. $("#c-slide ol .active").attr('data-slide-to'); => returns the current slide's Id :)
[14:56:01] <Thoams> oh
[14:56:05] <Thoams> k
[14:56:42] <Thoams> also: did mootools die a death
[14:56:45] <duch_kazatel> .data('slide-to')
[14:56:52] <duch_kazatel> yes, mootools is dead.
[14:56:57] <Thoams> super
[14:57:05] <duch_kazatel> hocza use .data() instead in that case.
[14:58:06] <Thoams> well I never
[14:58:11] <Thoams> ringgit
[14:58:40] <Thoams> nisseni: and the form you're POSTing?
[14:58:49] <Thoams> sorry, you may have posted that earlier
[14:59:12] <nisseni> Thoams: actually it's not a form per se, it's just data from the ajax post
[14:59:16] <hocza> duch_kazatel: ohhhh thanks :)
[14:59:27] <Thoams> sure
[15:00:17] <Thoams> you've checked var_dump($_POST) on the target page?
[15:02:15] <nisseni> Thoams: yes, I do get my correct response from the PayPal API, just not returned properly from the php file to the js file
[15:02:33] <nisseni> Thoams: I tried returning a simple Hello World, but that was empty as well
[15:06:11] <Thoams> have a crack with this instead of your .post
[15:06:11] <Thoams> http://pastebin.com/W4APyx7G
[15:06:31] <Thoams> probably have to remove comments
[15:08:51] <Thoams> also use a browser inspector and the 'Network' tab (or similar)
[15:09:17] <Thoams> should show you all XHR requests and the responses you're getting
[15:10:49] <d0de> When I use the jquery-mobile slider with a long slider-track, the slider handle doesn't slide properly in the android browser. It's ok for short distances, but over long distances it jumps from the start of the swipe to the end. Any advice on fixing?
[15:15:55] <nisseni> Thoams: using var_dump gives me the data in the alert(), but the return $response doesn't work
[15:17:50] <nisseni> Thoams: making an echo with the data json_encoded works. Doesn't feel right tho
[15:28:47] <saganbyte> i have a jquery ajax call to a jsp page. the funny thing is, i get a 200 OK in the network tab of my browser but the jsp itself doesnt return anything on the first ajax call. only from the second call onwards it does the required thing
[15:28:52] <saganbyte> any idea why this could be happening
[15:29:46] <t432> i'm working with the js framework twitter flight.  I bumped into this problem, can someone take a look? http://pastebin.com/1iAApbJz
[15:29:46] <Horacsio> I need a developer
[15:40:31] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/QCJ6u/ <- how come clicking the "reset" button doesn't trigger the change event on the slider?
[15:44:59] <decx> change happens after an input changes and goes out of focus, if you just change the val directly it's never in focus
[15:46:29] <decx> no idea if that's intentional though, just .trigger('change') after you set the val
[15:50:20] <d0de> decx, perfect, thanks
[15:51:29] <duch_kazatel> oh man i'm fixing so many little problems with out product page right now.
[16:53:03] <d0de> does anyone know if there's a way to get the html5 range input working with touch events on older Android platforms?
[16:54:05] <d0de> it works perfectly on api 4.4.x and the performance is soooo much better than jquery-mobile, but it doesn't work with touch inputs in 2.3.x
[17:02:26] <woebtz> The footnote for http://caniuse.com/input-range seems to claim it can be styled to be visible?
[17:05:29] <shann> hiii
[17:05:45] <shann> :))
[17:06:21] <duch_kazatel> hello
[17:11:52] <zylophone> hi, how can i find an element which has a certain text value? do i have to iterate through all the elements?
[17:12:58] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery containes
[17:12:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.contains() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[17:13:06] <duch_kazatel> hah autocorrected for me.
[17:13:14] <zylophone> thanks
[17:13:18] <duch_kazatel> be aware that's going to be stupid slow.
[17:13:51] <zylophone> uhm, was that for me?
[17:13:56] <zylophone> "Description: Check to see if a DOM element is a descendant of another DOM element."
[17:13:57] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:14:08] <duch_kazatel> - https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[17:14:11] <duch_kazatel> meant that
[17:14:13] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[17:14:17] <zylophone> ahh
[17:14:44] <zylophone> well, it's to iterate over 2-10 inputs, so would doing it manually be faster?
[17:15:06] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing this in the first place?
[17:15:18] <duch_kazatel> because manually enumerating will be slowish too.
[17:15:35] <zylophone> ok, back to the drawing board
[17:15:54] <duch_kazatel> why are you enumerating over the inputs though?
[17:16:00] <zylophone> long story short, input id name => a dl dt term with the value set in the dt for storage
[17:16:19] <duch_kazatel> woah what?  why are you storing data in the dom like that?
[17:16:26] <zylophone> so wanted to find the dt based on the input id
[17:16:48] <duch_kazatel> store that in an object instead.
[17:16:56] <zylophone> well, other than using browser storage, what are my other options?
[17:17:01] <zylophone> mhh
[17:17:07] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't need to persist, does it?
[17:17:46] <duch_kazatel> var myFormData = { id1: 'the first value', id2: 'the second value', id3: 'the third value' };
[17:17:47] <zylophone> not really
[17:17:51] <duch_kazatel> or use data attributes.
[17:18:22] <duch_kazatel> why are you storing things in the first place?
[17:18:54] <zylophone> data attributes are basically data-foo="asdf" data-bar="qwerty" ?
[17:19:05] <duch_kazatel> yes.  you can also set them with.data()
[17:19:11] <zylophone> that's perfect then!
[17:19:17] <zylophone> thanks for saving me many headaches!
[17:19:35] <duch_kazatel> why are you needing to store data like that though?
[17:20:11] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: a page layout app
[17:20:43] <duch_kazatel> no idea what that has to do with anything.
[17:20:44] <zylophone> like, i'm asking for div id's classes etc, for rendering of it upon export, but don't want the data to be applied during preview
[17:21:08] <duch_kazatel> so you want an easy way to get all your data?
[17:21:18] <duch_kazatel> because then you should be using a plain old object instead.
[17:22:26] <zylophone> so a user drags say, a container onto the layout pane, and it previews, the user can then set an id, classes etc on that container div, so data-id, data-classes etc would be perfect because when generating teh html for the page for output (rather than preview) i can just pull out these values
[17:22:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah, an object would make more sense, but whatever works i guess.
[17:23:24] <zylophone> would .data(el) return all the data for that el, or do i have to manually specify keys?
[17:23:48] <duch_kazatel> $el.data('foo); gets you the f00 data attribute for the element.
[17:23:54] <duch_kazatel> you have to manually specify keys
[17:24:49] <zylophone> ahh, well if i'm to allow the user to create their own keys - such as for data, then i would have no way of knowing what they were, so yeah, maybe an object would be better
[17:25:15] <duch_kazatel> kay
[17:25:16] <duch_kazatel> i'm off
[17:25:36] <zylophone> thanks
[17:26:02] <sahbeewah_> $el.data() will return an object with all the keys / values
[17:26:35] <sahbeewah_> as will $.data(el), if you prefer
[17:26:39] <zylophone> ah, thanks sahbeewah_ the docs page doesn't mention that
[17:27:47] <hd1> I'm rendering a CSV log to a div as part of an HTML report... the log is timestamped with epoch time, does anyone know how to convert this easily to ISO8601 format?
[17:28:57] <zylophone> bog standard javascript time functions?
[17:29:29] <sahbeewah_> zylophone: it is in the docs...
[17:29:49] <sahbeewah_> hd1: new Date(epoch_time).toISOString();
[17:30:18] <sahbeewah_> use a polyfill for older browsers
[17:31:04] <sahbeewah_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString
[17:40:43] <hd1> and how would i access one column from my csv file? "$('CSVTable').column"?
[17:42:30] <BillCriswell> hd1: Are you using some kind of csv parser?
[17:44:46] <delboy1978uk_> anyone using a bootstrap carousel know how to stop the thing moving?! it starts to move even although im only half way through typing into the form, and i already told it to pause :-s
[17:44:56] <hd1> BillCriswell, am using the jquery csv table plugin
[17:45:27] <hd1> BillCriswell, https://code.google.com/p/jquerycsvtotable/ that one
[17:46:33] <BillCriswell> hd1: This just takes the csv and puts it into a table. Did you want to get the column from that table?
[17:47:20] <zylophone> what's wrong with this: $inputs = $('.element-attribute-input:not([type=button])');
[17:47:24] <hd1> BillCriswell: yes
[17:47:26] <zylophone> i want to exclude all buttons
[17:47:38] <BillCriswell> zylophone: That should be fine.
[17:47:46] <hd1> BillCriswell: alternatively, I can get it from the CSV itself
[17:47:47] <BillCriswell> hd1: Do you want it as an array?
[17:48:18] <hd1> if I can iterate through said array easily, BillCriswell
[17:49:29] <BillCriswell> Do you want the array of the text or the element?
[17:50:29] <hd1> BillCriswell: I want the contents of the column, so I can then convert it to ISO8601 format
[17:52:28] <BillCriswell> To put it back into the table?
[17:54:09] <BillCriswell> hd1: http://jsbin.com/jovecabe/1/edit?html,js,output This should get you close enough.
[17:55:00] <BillCriswell> Hmm... I expected $('td td:eq(0)') to select the first cell of each row but it didn't. I had to do $('tr').find('td:eq(0)')... That doesn't seem right.
[17:56:13] <hd1> your replace isn't working either, BillCriswell
[17:56:36] <BillCriswell> hd1: Working here.
[17:56:52] <BillCriswell> might need to refresh it. Sometimes jsbin is weird to load.
[17:57:18] <hd1> there we are
[17:58:24] <sahbeewah_> BillCriswell: .eq(n) will get the first jquery object returned after evaluating the selector. what you're looking for is: $('tr td:first-child')
[17:58:47] <sahbeewah_> nth, rather
[17:59:29] <BillCriswell> Yeah, first-child is like nth-child(1)
[17:59:40] <BillCriswell> Weird. Expected eq(0) to be the same thing.
[18:00:09] <BillCriswell> sahbeewah_: I was using :eq(0), not.eq(0)
[18:01:24] <sahbeewah_> ok, but it's effectively the same thing
[18:03:45] <BillCriswell> sahbeewah_: Yeah, just a brain fart.
[18:04:08] <hd1> thanks BillCriswell
[18:05:46] <AGreyCrane> Any suggestions why .html('taco') would be adding quotes around taco, <p>"taco"</p> instead of <p>taco</p>?
[18:07:06] <BillCriswell> AGreyCrane: That's a new one. Can you replicate it on jsbin?
[18:07:49] <AGreyCrane> BillCriswell: I will see about that and report back :)
[18:08:53] <BillCriswell> AGreyCrane: The only way I can see that possibly happening is if there's css :before and :after content with quotes.
[18:09:09] <zylophone> mhh, i thought when adding to the $el.data(foo,someval), it adds the attribute data-foo to the element?
[18:09:25] <BillCriswell> zylophone: Nope.
[18:10:06] <BillCriswell> It saves it in some inner jQuery database thingie.
[18:10:34] <zylophone> voodoo
[18:11:09] <zylophone> mhh, well i guess as long as 'it just works'
[18:12:57] <sahbeewah_> zylophone: i personally prefer to just use .attr('data-foo') as opposed to .data('foo'). it sacrifices some efficiency but it's a lot easier to debug, and its more consistent because you know you'll always get back a string, as opposed to jquery doing some conversion magic in the background
[18:14:37] <BillCriswell> sahbeewah_: Some good points for sure, I still like to use data though.
[18:33:12] <xniz> anyone up for checkin out a webpage and seeing if theres anything i should change as far as structure and organization ? :P
[18:33:28] <xniz> I am pleased with what I have, just not sure if I'm doing it "right" ;)
[18:49:21] <AGreyCrane> BillCriswell: Thanks for confirming that would indeed be odd. After not being able to reproduce the issue at jsbin, I determined I was an idiot and found what was actually wrong with my code.
[18:49:50] <BillCriswell> AGreyCrane: Always happens haha.
[19:08:22] <__equinox_> guys I am very new to jQuery, have the following code http://pastie.org/9109653
[19:08:27] <__equinox_> why is nth-child not working here
[19:08:34] <__equinox_> I want to get the 3rd child of elem
[19:18:41] <BillCriswell> __equinox_: You need a space.
[19:18:57] <BillCriswell> $(elem).find(':nth-child(3)')
[19:19:58] <BillCriswell> Assuming you are looking for the children of elem.
[19:20:56] <BillCriswell> __equinox_: I think my brain might be fried tonight. Have a demo?
[19:25:51] <zylophone> ohh, i think i've just discovered something weird
[19:26:57] <zylophone> so, i have a div that i'm changing from #foo and then removing the id when not needed and setting the id on another div. now, i'm setting .data('qwerty','val') on #foo when it's equal to different divs, but it seems that retrieving data for #foo seems to give just one result set, is this due to how jq stores teh data?
[19:28:22] <zylophone> guess this is the quiet time for jq ;)
[19:34:04] <zylophone> nm, i was being retarded and missed a #
[20:15:12] <tandroid> Is there a way to test the values of variables in the dev tools? I thought I could just type the name of the variable into the console but it says it's not defined.
[20:15:54] <tandroid> And by "test" I just mean see the values
[20:44:07] <vinex08> guys how can i reverse this? when i click the button, it goes up.. i want it to go down... here's my code
[20:44:07] <vinex08> jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: -300 }, 1000);
[22:01:03] <dont-panic> How come event.preventDefault(); doesn't seem to work?
[22:03:55] <Uhkis> event is wrong maybe
[22:07:08] <tomoyuki28jp> When I bind event like this `$('#foo li').hover(function() {})`, how can I know the current li is a which position (nth)?
[22:07:54] <dont-panic> maybe I'm doing it wrong.  I have an empty paragraph that when you hover over it it runs a function that grabs a random array element.  the array elements are text wrapped in <a> tags.  It keeps returning the href which is what I want, but it won't concatenate anything on to the href
[22:15:06] <relipse> I want to move an element left+3, i can't use css() to grab the original left position, and position() is returning undefined, what do I do
[22:15:14] <relipse> it is relatively positioned
[22:17:38] <relipse> why is position() returning false
[22:17:42] <relipse> i mean undefiend
[22:20:16] <Uhkis> dont-panic: jsfiddle is you actually want help with it
[22:22:28] <relipse> actually i found the issue
[22:22:33] <relipse> i was calling it before it loaded
[22:22:43] <relipse> i fixed it by putting it in $(function(){
[22:24:25] <Uhkis> :-)
[22:26:12] <tomoyuki28jp> $(this).closest('ul').find('li').index(this) did the trick. thanks
[22:27:45] <Voyage> Hi
[22:28:10] <Voyage> I am using these includes for jquery datepicker. somehow it works but the layout is disturbed. why so ? http://pastie.org/9110133
[22:37:31] <chili_con_carne> anyon familiar with the datepicker object? If I am using an inline object how do I get the selected value? I can get the selected dom element but is there a way to just get the currently selected date?
[22:38:56] <chili_con_carne> ah got it
[22:44:15] <wa5ted> hey what is the correct way to repvent a link's default behaviour
[22:44:26] <wa5ted> i tried event.preventDefault on a .click method on the a selector
[22:44:27] <wa5ted> and it doesnt work
[22:48:17] <wa5ted> nvm found it
[22:57:28] <guideX> with juicebox, it's not hitting the onInitComplete event http://pastebin.com/zWeMeSBz
[23:01:50] <guideX> any ideas whynot
[23:04:06] <Voyage> I am using these includes for jquery datepicker. somehow it works but the layout is disturbed. why so ?  http://pastie.org/9110663
[23:08:38] <drawingthesun> hey, how do you access $ (jquery controls) inside another js file? Both are loaded by the html <script?
[23:08:41] <drawingthesun> <script>
[23:08:57] <drawingthesun> I am using $.get(
[23:09:06] <drawingthesun> in a js file called code.js
[23:09:09] <drawingthesun> but nothing happens!
[23:09:34] <drawingthesun> Seems jquery only works if the javascript is the header in html, this isn't what i want
[23:25:48] <Cork> drawingthesun: jquery works in everything on the page after the script file has been loaded
[23:26:05] <Cork> drawingthesun: you normally want to load jquery in head
[23:26:33] <Cork> drawingthesun: you have to implement a solution that waits for the script to be loaded if you don't want to load jquery in head
[23:26:50] <drawingthesun> Thanks Cork
[23:30:30] <guideX> I usually load jquery at the bottom of the page, oh well
[23:51:17] <nisseni> not sure if the issue is jquery or php, but here's the code: http://pastie.org/private/tfkdycavo0ljtnr6jdcug - a return becomes empty in the jquery data variable, however, an echo works fine.
[23:52:05] <Cork> nisseni: check in the browser console what the server sends
[23:53:56] <nisseni> Cork: the data or the headers?
[23:54:09] <Cork> nisseni: the body
[23:55:27] <nisseni> Cork: it's an empty response when making a return with php, when making an echo I get the json_encode that I want
[23:55:55] <Cork> nisseni: if the body is empty then you know why you don't have any data in js
[23:56:06] <Cork> your php doesn't send any data
[23:57:41] <nisseni> Cork: yeah, but the variable is obviously not empty, since it works with echo but not return
[23:58:09] <Cork> nisseni: why would return  put text in the php response buffer?
[23:58:12] <Uhkis> nisseni: return doesnt print anything = response is empty
[23:59:00] <nisseni> so I should be using echo?
[23:59:04] <Uhkis> yes
[23:59:13] <Uhkis> js can't magically get your php return values ;-)
[23:59:32] <nisseni> Uhkis: beh ;)
[23:59:39] <Cork> or rather the browser can't magically get the internal state of your server process
