[01:38:50] <printForever> how do I apply .each() to each element inside an object?
[01:43:58] <rickymiller> printForever: If it's a JQ object, it's just $('#myElement').each(function(value) { console.log(value) })
[01:44:16] <printForever> its a variable that contains the list of properties
[01:44:27] <printForever> https://www.veebimajutus.ee/
[01:44:34] <printForever> open console
[01:44:40] <printForever> type in "ORDER_DETAILS"
[01:45:06] <printForever> that is a var object, right?
[01:45:48] <rickymiller> printForever: cool to /query?
[01:46:01] <printForever> ?
[01:54:05] <rickymiller> >_<
[02:18:27] <yabbah> Hi, I have a "reset" button on my page .. I want that to reload the current dir, how do I reload a given div?
[02:18:58] <Cork> yabbah: you can't
[02:19:11] <Cork> you have to have a resource on the server that can send the new content
[02:20:24] <yabbah> uhm, okey. Cuz now I just use 'wrapper.find('username').val(''); for ie that field. But that make that the seach in the username-field wont work after reset. :/
[02:20:53] <Cork> what?
[02:21:04] <Cork> what does that have to do with reloading a div?
[02:32:29] <Ashokkumar> hi, sortable("disable") doesnot work in connected list after start event, is this expected behavior?
[02:39:24] <yabbah> Cork, sorry. That might not have anything to do with reloading a div, but that was a way to make it work I thought. As for now I can "reset" the content in all input/selects with the reset.
[03:23:52] <printForever> got disconnected...
[03:24:15] <printForever> anyway, I managed to find the answers and understand the things on my own
[03:24:22] <printForever> however, I'm stuck at a pretty stupid point
[03:24:31] <printForever> how do I get a property from an Array?
[03:24:52] <Cork> property?
[03:24:54] <printForever> I have an array, and I need a value of a property called "current:"
[03:25:14] <Cork> so you have an array of objects?
[03:25:18] <printForever> correct
[03:25:20] <Cork> [{},{},{}]
[03:25:23] <printForever> yup
[03:25:43] <printForever> and I managed to get .each() working on it, so I can go through each of them
[03:25:57] <printForever> I managed to get the indexes :D thats about as far as I got
[03:26:16] <printForever> so, at least I'm 100% sure that I'm getting the objects from the array correctly
[03:26:39] <printForever> now, I'm confused to how to get the property value from the object inside the array
[03:26:48] <Cork> $.each(arr, function(i, obj) { obj.current })
[03:26:49] <printForever> I tried value.current
[03:26:53] <printForever> LOL
[03:26:55] <Cork> that would give you what your looking for
[03:27:18] <Cork> note that you should use $.each not $().each when looping arrays or objects
[03:27:30] <printForever> I know the difference, thanks
[03:27:37] <printForever> but... obj...
[03:27:45] <printForever> is obj a default name?
[03:27:49] <printForever> or the name of the object?
[03:27:58] <Cork> check the function definition
[03:28:02] <Cork> $.each(arr, function(i, obj) <-- { obj.current })
[03:28:20] <printForever> I understand the definition, I dont get the "obj"
[03:28:32] <Cork> then you don't understand the definition
[03:28:37] <printForever> I know you're referencing the object
[03:28:43] <printForever> I'm confused to how I should write it
[03:28:47] <Cork> it's just a name
[03:28:47] <printForever> is it the name of the object
[03:28:51] <printForever> the index...
[03:28:54] <printForever> ok, got it
[03:29:01] <printForever> so it can be anything
[03:29:02] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[03:29:15] <Cork> "callback Type: Function( Integer indexInArray, Object value )"
[03:29:28] <printForever> Cork
[03:29:32] <printForever> I luvz you
[03:29:41] <printForever> got it!
[03:30:54] <jerit> I'm terrified to test my code because I have no idea if it'll work
[03:31:20] <Cork> interesting, i'm usually terrified IF the code works the first time i run it
[03:31:38] <Uhkis> i'm terrified about untested code
[03:38:10] <jerit> I'm using ajax to post input data to my Controller which is building a JSON array full of data which I'm building a table full of on my page. FOr each array item, I need a new row in my table with the json values in each cell
[03:38:18] <jerit> I think it should work but who knows
[03:38:50] <Cork> perfect case for a template
[03:49:27] <jerit> okay so how do I get to see my json in the success block here? http://pastebin.com/9MypPYFW
[03:49:59] <jerit> I have no idea what the controller's sending back so I can't be sure that this output to the table will work
[03:50:31] <Cork> jerit: just console.log(data)
[03:50:39] <jerit> derp, thanks :)
[03:50:47] <Cork> also data.Receipts.each won't work
[03:50:47] <jerit> its still early here >.<
[03:51:01] <Cork> that would require data.Receipts.each to be a a jquery object
[03:51:04] <Cork> opps
[03:51:07] <Cork> that would require data.Receipts to be a a jquery object
[03:51:14] <jerit> data.Receipts should be an array of JSON so not sure how to loop through it
[03:51:34] <jerit> wait
[03:51:36] <Cork> $.each(data.Receipts, function(i, o) {})
[03:51:54] <jerit> that other guy used a foreach
[03:51:56] <jerit> that would work
[03:52:09] <Cork> it is less cross browser, but yes it works in modern browsers
[03:52:25] <fn> http://pastie.org/10858838 - $(this) isn't the <a/> tag, why?
[03:52:31] <Cork> also $(this).Number makes no sense
[03:52:31] <jerit> so $.each will work better, Cork?
[03:52:44] <Cork> jerit: it works in basically all browsers that support js
[03:52:58] <Cork> not sure about ie4
[03:53:01] <Cork> :)
[03:53:34] <Cork> fn: delegate doesn't work like that
[03:53:41] <Cork> fn: remove the this.el.find()
[03:53:48] <Cork> the second argument should be a string
[03:54:28] <fn> k, thanks
[03:57:12] <jerit> Cork, I normally use $.post for my ajax posts, but this is neater... thing is I'm not sure what its expecting to get back, and its returning the error block except that nothing's breaking on the server side
[03:57:45] <Cork> jerit: are you sure the backend supports jsonp?
[03:57:59] <Cork> most stock servers doesn't
[03:59:16] <jerit> changed that to 'json' now so lets see
[03:59:37] <Cork> uh
[03:59:49] <Cork> you should NEVER use jsonp unless you absolute have to...
[03:59:52] <jerit> Create:142 Uncaught ReferenceError: foreach is not defined
[04:00:06] <jerit> sec, lemme update my paste
[04:00:12] <Cork> check what data contains
[04:02:20] <jerit> Cork: http://pastebin.com/9MypPYFW
[04:02:37] <Cork> uh
[04:02:48] <Cork> foreach isn't written like that
[04:03:01] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[04:05:00] <jerit> cork: data.Receipts.forEach(function () { // do the stuff }); ?
[04:15:43] <jerit> Cork this hasn't worked quite right http://i.imgur.com/Ga5Hv4o.png
[04:17:55] <Diplomat> Guys, I have this funky issue.. For some reason when I press tab to display a new input in a cell, it doesn't want to create an input into it. I can see that it finds the correct cell and everything is nice, but it wont create an input. Here's my code: http://paste.ofcode.org/ERnrYTj7ZQNV5DTAWmSWpJ
[04:19:08] <Diplomat> If you check console you can see that it finds the correct table cell, but $(object).html(input) is not doing what it supposed to do
[04:19:12] <Diplomat> No idea why
[04:21:58] <jerit> Diplomat tried $(object).append(input)?
[04:22:18] <Diplomat> Yup, didnt work
[04:28:49] <Diplomat> Tried $(object).empty().append(input) too.. didnt work, only works when I actually click on the cell, not after pressing tab
[04:29:17] <jerit> has it worked on other cells or just this one?
[04:29:48] <Diplomat> it havent worked for any cell
[04:29:57] <Diplomat> only clicking on the cell works
[04:30:15] <Diplomat> but log shows that it finds the correct cell + input's HTML is correct too
[04:30:41] <Diplomat> Just nesting functions.. but on the second run it doesn't seem to like something
[04:51:13] <Diplomat> Hmn, $(object).parent().append(input) seems to work, but it adds inputs to wrong places and doesnt hide the old one
[04:54:18] <jerit> Diplomat that tells me that your selector isn't quite right
[04:54:51] <Diplomat> but when Im not using it then my selector is correct.. i tested with coloring the text and it works fine
[04:54:59] <Diplomat> but it doesn't create the input
[05:00:41] <Diplomat> What confuses me is that it clearly finds the correct cell and I can output anything from that cell (id, class, other attributes etc).. which shows it's correct, but for some reason it doesn't create an input into it. I tried changing background color, text color.. they all work, but not creating an input
[05:11:55] <Diplomat> When I commented out editable(tc) and append html there.. then it works fine: https://jsfiddle.net/xpbmf4ju/
[05:18:14] <Diplomat> What the hell.. I moved that editing block to saving event and now using enter it works perfectly :|
[05:18:50] <Diplomat> But with tab it's not working hmn
[05:20:13] <maasha> I have two lists and want to be able to drag&copy items from one to the other, however, items with accordions the accordions stops working in the original list: https://jsfiddle.net/vn52ewrk/1/
[05:21:03] <Diplomat> WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[05:21:12] <Diplomat> I just had to do.. e.preventDefault
[05:21:25] <Diplomat> damn tab, wants special treatment n shit
[05:32:59] <Duikb00t> o/
[05:39:59] <Diplomat> o7
[05:49:35] <Duikb00t> :D
[06:28:32] <bongjovi> Using this line: document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('popup', { 'foo': 'bar' }));
[06:28:40] <bongjovi> Shouldn't $(document).on('popup', function(e){ console.log(e.foo); }); log 'bar'?
[07:05:05] <Cork> bongjovi: i don't think you can add extra properties to custom events like that
[07:05:19] <Cork> either way if you could it would be on e.originalEvent
[07:09:27] <Cork> bongjovi: also why don't you just use $(document).trigger('popup', {}) ?
[07:09:57] <bongjovi> ah because the lines are in separate files
[07:10:09] <bongjovi> the former can't have any dependencies
[07:10:40] <bongjovi> it's a plugin
[07:10:52] <Cork> bongjovi: this is what you need to do https://jsfiddle.net/9nahwLd3/
[07:11:02] <Cork> you can't add random properties outside detail
[07:11:03] <bongjovi> but thanks Cork, I used {detail: "bar"}
[07:11:07] <bongjovi> :)
[07:11:12] <bongjovi> i hadn't realized
[07:11:26] <bongjovi> all working correctly now
[07:11:45] <bongjovi> but yeah, usually I would use trigger but the first line has to be pure JS
[07:11:54] <Cork> bongjovi: https://jsfiddle.net/9nahwLd3/2/
[07:12:01] <Cork> like i said use originalEvent.detail
[07:12:24] <bongjovi> yep, all good
[07:12:25] <bongjovi> thanks
[07:12:51] <jerit> so if the value has a decimal (ie 34.97) I want to output the value, otherwise I want output the value + ".00" (ie 60.00) https://jsfiddle.net/chvru467/
[07:12:58] <jerit> this isn't working so far
[07:13:15] <Cork> jerit: .toFixed(2)
[07:13:36] <Cork> you need a rounding function either way as it is floats
[07:14:19] <jerit> Cork key.ReceiptValue.toFixed(2)? These are currency values I'm working with
[07:15:10] <Cork> as it looks like you're working with strings you would have to parse it first
[07:15:22] <Cork> so parseFloat(value).toFixed(2)
[07:15:27] <jerit> also why isn't my loop writing the first value @ 34.53?
[07:16:00] <Cork> cause you replace it on each loop
[07:16:06] <Cork> (don't modify the dom in a loop)
[07:16:57] <jerit> .append > .html then?
[07:17:04] <Cork> no
[07:17:09] <Cork> i just said don't modify the dom in a loop
[07:17:14] <jerit> https://jsfiddle.net/chvru467/2/
[07:17:29] <jerit> but then how am I supposed to write my array values to the page?
[07:18:12] <Cork> jerit: https://jsfiddle.net/chvru467/3/
[07:19:21] <jerit> oh cool... now how do I put that in a table?
[07:24:33] <jerit> okay that was easy actually, thanks Cork
[07:47:03] <Akimb> Let's say I have 3 elements, which take up 100% width and height - kinda like slides over all of the screen. How can I make it so: when I scroll down, the window moves below to slide 2 and when I scroll down again, window moves to slide 3 ? And in the opposite direction
[07:51:04] <Akimb> the basic gist of how the slides are structured can be seen here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oLgXNa
[07:52:21] <Duikb00t> o/
[08:08:10] <DjBonadoobie> akimb, i don't personally have experience with that, but I found this... http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage is that what you're thinking of?
[08:56:26] <dev-jose> hi good morning
[08:56:56] <dev-jose> what think about jquery 3.0 RC
[08:56:58] <dev-jose> ?
[09:03:20] <dev-jose> SpecialTech: hi
[09:08:23] <Cork> dev-jose: can't say i care too much about it
[09:08:30] <Cork> it has some nice speed ups that's about it
[09:10:18] <Duikb00t> Cork:  Have you got some experience with RevealJS?
[09:10:58] <Cork> think i've seen it a few times
[09:11:15] <Cork> i think mozilla used it a lot a while back
[09:11:23] <Duikb00t> Im having a hard issue :(
[09:11:26] <Cork> (for there slides)
[09:11:37] <Duikb00t> I have to go 3 levels 'deep' but it only supports 2 I guess?
[09:11:51] <Cork> couldn't help you there
[09:11:56] <Cork> i've never ever used the lib
[09:12:22] <Duikb00t> Ok :) no problem http://i.imgur.com/4LmNDkv.png this is what Im trying to achieve :P
[09:12:36] <Duikb00t> If you ahve an alternative in mind
[09:13:33] <Cork> can't say i have
[09:30:22] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:30:27] <Akimb> DjBonadoobie, yes that was what I was looking for, thanks!
[09:30:39] <jomofcw> Just to be sure : there is no "AJAX Uploader thing" in jQuery UI ?
[09:31:03] <DjBonadoobie> Akimb: np, good luck
[09:31:34] <Cork> jomofcw: uh in ui?
[09:31:41] <Cork> jomofcw: why would there have to be one?
[09:31:49] <Cork> jomofcw: its just a normal ajax call
[09:32:02] <Cork> all you need is an input type="file" field
[09:36:22] <jomofcw> Cork yup it's been a long time =). Hm, OK you're right. But regarding some jQuery Uploaed plugin I just asked myself if there isn't already one in jQuery UI, theming with the jQuery UI theme.
[09:36:53] <Cork> jomofcw: i don't see why there should be
[09:37:05] <Cork> if you don't want the default input design for input fields
[09:37:16] <Cork> just bind a click on anything and trigger a click on the input field
[09:37:37] <Cork> it is dead simple to design what ever you like for file updates now days
[09:37:39] <jomofcw> Cork OK.
[09:38:10] <Cork> a completely different beast to when ajax couldn't submit files in many browsers
[09:38:19] <jomofcw> Cork in fact, the dficult part according to me is the progress bar (which need a server side script anyway).
[09:55:47] <z1haze1> I have a issue with a hover slide down container being a little finnicky. is there a way that you can prevent a slideup event if the mouse exists for more than a period of time? my issue is that if you hover over a certain area and the element slides down if you just barely move the mouse out of the area it will slide back up
[09:56:10] <z1haze1> Im told they want a sort of time like if i move the mouse out of the area, but i come back it within like  second, dont slide up
[10:02:58] <z1haze1> anyway to only execute the mouseout function if the time of mouseout is passed a certain time?
[10:03:13] <DjBonadoobie> zlhazel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6231052/how-to-have-a-mouseover-event-fire-only-if-the-mouse-is-hovered-over-an-element
[10:03:37] <DjBonadoobie> haven't done it personally, but that looks about what your describing?
[10:04:07] <kba> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js points to v1.11.1. Is that intentional?
[10:06:22] <DjBonadoobie> kba: i think so... judging by the v2 src url which is "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js". So i guess if you don't specific the v# it's assumed you mean 1... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:19:53] <z1haze1> DjBonadoobie: that doesnt stop it from firing if i mouseout then mouse back in before the timelimit
[10:20:05] <z1haze1> that just makes it fire after a certain time, every time
[10:25:05] <jomofcw> Are you aware of a jQuery plugin that provide "customisation manager" ? In fact somthing that can handle "layou" where I push image or text zone that I can move/resize/rotate etc ?
[10:26:46] <z1haze_work> there are some grid plugins that let you move elements but rotate, i dont know
[10:30:11] <jomofcw> z1haze thanks. I search something like this one : http://fengyuanchen.github.io/photo-editor/ but enable me to work with more than one image on the workflow, and text zone too.
[10:41:50] <jefferson> hi guys
[10:42:27] <jefferson> I'm trying to make an ajax call, but depending on the response lenght i get "unexpected end of input"
[10:43:21] <Cork> jefferson: what encoding are you using? (json, jsonp, text ...)
[10:43:22] <Z3R0> any reason a disabled=‘disabled’ button, that shows it’s disabled, but calling a click event on the class of that button still fires?
[10:43:40] <Cork> Z3R0: it shouldn't
[10:43:44] <Z3R0> my thoughts...
[10:43:58] <Cork> though note you can't set disabled with .attr
[10:44:06] <Z3R0> I”m not it’s server side
[10:44:10] <Cork> you have to use .prop('disabled', true/false)
[10:44:12] <Cork> k
[10:44:55] <Z3R0> <a disabled="disabled" href=“#” class="resource-show btn btn-xs btn-info">View Resource</a> // $(‘.resource-show’).on(‘click’, etc…) still fires...
[10:45:01] <jefferson> Cork: This is my code https://jsfiddle.net/h4g9ryz1/
[10:45:15] <Cork> Z3R0: https://jsfiddle.net/whLjgo7p/
[10:45:18] <Cork> can't reproduce
[10:45:31] <Z3R0> sec
[10:45:49] <Cork> jefferson: that doesn't tell me what encoding is used
[10:46:03] <Cork> especially as it is from localhost...
[10:46:05] <Z3R0> https://jsfiddle.net/whLjgo7p/1/
[10:46:07] <Z3R0> try that ;)
[10:46:22] <Cork> Z3R0: that's a link not a button
[10:46:27] <Cork> and yes links don't have disabled
[10:46:32] <Cork> only form fields doers
[10:46:34] <Cork> *does
[10:46:37] <Z3R0> hmmm....
[10:46:44] <Z3R0> ok
[10:47:01] <Z3R0> switching to button ;)
[10:47:04] <jefferson> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/h4g9ryz1/1/
[10:47:19] <jefferson> I'm sending as text, i guess, then receiving as json
[10:47:54] <Z3R0> thanks Cork
[10:47:57] <Cork> jefferson: ok your doing this wrong in lots of places
[10:48:06] <Cork> jefferson: the server should send what type of data it is sending
[10:48:24] <Cork> it does this by setting the "Content-Type: application/json" header
[10:48:33] <jefferson> Cork: my server answers with "return json_encode($array)"
[10:48:35] <Cork> if you do you won't need the JSON.parse line
[10:48:41] <Cork> jefferson: doesn't matter
[10:48:53] <Cork> unless you set the header it default to text/html
[10:48:59] <Cork> so you send html and parse it as json...
[10:49:11] <Cork> (i hope you see the problem with that)
[10:49:23] <jefferson> I see, Cork
[10:49:25] <jefferson> Thanks
[10:49:52] <z1haze_work> Z3R0: you could add a class at the end of your onclick function and check if it has the class when a user clicks?
[10:50:19] <Z3R0> I could just return false if attr(‘disabled’) ?
[10:50:34] <Cork> you should prob use a <button>
[10:50:43] <z1haze_work> anchors dont have disabled
[10:50:43] <Cork> no scratch that
[10:50:49] <Cork> you SHOULD use a button
[10:50:54] <Cork> as what your creating isn't a link
[10:50:58] <Z3R0> right
[10:51:09] <Cork> then all this problem would go away
[10:51:09] <Z3R0> already switched and they are fine… and hi btw z1haze_work :)
[10:51:21] <Z3R0> ya it did :)
[10:51:32] <Cork> and you would be semantically correct (and accesibible for free)
[10:51:57] <Cork> Z3R0: another note, make sure you use type="button"
[10:52:04] <Cork> else you might submit a form by mistake
[10:52:17] <Cork> as <button>s are type="submit" by default
[10:52:33] <Z3R0> ah true that
[10:53:21] <xenaxon> how can I get the order number of a draggable element
[10:53:26] <xenaxon> hi all.
[10:53:41] <Cork> xenaxon: .draggable('option') if i remember correctly
[10:53:47] <Cork> check the api page
[10:54:17] <xenaxon> Cork: I meant, for SORTABLE not draggable sorry
[10:54:30] <Cork> should be the same answer
[10:55:28] <xenaxon> Cork: I am looking in option in the API but can't seem to find anything to the order id
[10:56:05] <Cork> ya, looking too haven't used it in a long time
[11:00:03] <jefferson> Cork: I've added the type on my return, but still the problem persists
[11:06:19] <Cork> jefferson: you don't add it to the return
[11:06:27] <Cork> you set it as a response header
[11:06:48] <Cork> jefferson: looked like you used php so http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[11:06:58] <jefferson> hmmmmmmm thank you Cork
[11:08:01] <xenaxon> Cork: is it even possible to get it?
[11:08:16] <Cork> ah sorry got busy
[11:08:19] <Cork> let me look again
[11:10:49] <Cork> ah
[11:11:08] <Cork> xenaxon: you can't grab the data from sortable, cause it actually doesn't know
[11:11:24] <Cork> xenaxon: an option would be to use $(elm).index()
[11:11:37] <Cork> xenaxon: the order is based on the order of the dom elements
[11:13:36] <kba> DjBonadoobie: Oh, I meant the fact that 1.12.4 is the newest one and the one advertised on https://jquery.com/download/
[11:17:20] <xenaxon> Cork, that would be good enough
[11:17:31] <xenaxon> but but order of the element where?
[11:17:39] <xenaxon> in it's container, or in the dom or where
[11:23:37] <Cork> xenaxon: sortable moves the dom position in the dom tree
[11:23:56] <Cork> xenaxon: so the dom position is what stors the order position of the element
[11:24:14] <Cork> (inspect the dom while sorting and you will see what i mean)
[11:24:19] <xenaxon> Cork: so if I get the index, will it give me the order of that sortable element within the sortable container?
[11:24:20] <xenaxon> I will test.
[11:24:22] <xenaxon> now
[11:24:26] <Cork> not really
[11:24:35] <xenaxon> Cork: then what
[11:24:37] <Cork> it will give you the elements position in the childNode list
[11:25:07] <Cork> in a nested sortable you will have to check parents until you get to the sortable container to get the full position
[11:25:49] <Cork> xenaxon: my point is .index() is not specific to sortable
[11:26:01] <Cork> it is a standard function of jquery
[11:36:36] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I've one request for getting a form, and one request to send the form data to a .php file that should run a query and insert the data provided in the form. Basically, I can't get the process from sending the data and running the SQL query in the .php file to insert the data into the db, what's wrong with this code? Any thoughts? https://pastee.org/rkxup
[12:23:16] <artisanIndia> I am trying to get the data value of a li which is created from jquery https://jsfiddle.net/4pfL7ue8/ its not happening
[12:23:40] <robertmaxrees> which li?
[12:23:46] <robertmaxrees> also: this is missing some code.
[12:24:53] <artisanIndia> yes it is robertmaxrees
[12:25:07] <VectorX> on a form, i need to create a text field, lets say colors, where a user can click a + or - button to add another textbox to add more colors, the field will be colors[], is there a good example for doing something similar
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> so where's the code where you're trying to get the data-value
[12:25:37] <mmmveggies> VectorX: might want to try a custom "tags" input field.
[12:25:47] <artisanIndia> that code is inside jqeury line number 16
[12:25:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ otherwise you're hand rolling it.
[12:25:57] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia huh?
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia you mean '<span class="badge badge-success">' + value.amount + '</span>' + ?
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia it's really hard to understand where things are actually breaking for you.
[12:26:22] <mmmveggies> VectorX: https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/ for example
[12:26:23] <VectorX> mmmveggies i need it to create the seperate rows
[12:26:35] <artisanIndia> on line 16 <h4 class="getamount media-heading" data-price="'+ value.amount+'">'+ value.detail+'</h4>
[12:26:42] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia so how is that broken?
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> VectorX then you'll need to just .append() the inputs and then custom build your object that gets posted.
[12:27:26] <artisanIndia> when I m trying to get the data-price by $('.getamount').click(function() {var price = $(this).data('price');}); I get nothing
[12:27:47] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia that's why - you can't bind to something that doesn't yet exist.  use a delegated listener for that instead.
[12:27:52] <VectorX> robertmaxrees yeah, i wanted to see if there was any good example, to make sure i dont miss anything, in terms of making the code portable
[12:28:08] <artisanIndia> how ? any reference
[12:28:10] <artisanIndia> ?
[12:28:11] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia $('.2gdata').on('click', '.media', function() {});
[12:28:20] <artisanIndia> ok
[12:28:24] <robertmaxrees> or whatever selector you want in the second arg.
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> VectorX that's one of those specific use cases that you're not really going to find an example for.
[12:28:47] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia you're already using a delegated listener in your code for that change handler.
[12:29:18] <artisanIndia> going through the link you pasted
[12:29:38] <robertmaxrees> artisanIndia make sure you read the whole thing and don't skip to the examples: the examples can be misleading without context.
[12:29:58] <artisanIndia> sure sir
[12:50:35] <Pazician> I've this code, it's running the success function but it doesn't proceed to the queries in the .php file for some reasons? https://pastee.org/hn4pa
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:51:08] <robertmaxrees> woah - sooo you realize that every time that success runs you're adding another submit handler, right?
[12:53:02] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: yeah, but shouldn't it work like one request for getting the form and one for sending the data?
[12:53:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> it'll run that submit handler however many times you've hit that outer click handler.
[12:53:37] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't replace the last one - it adds another.
[12:54:16] <Pazician> Hold on... I just relized that I can loop the form in the loop and then just use one $-ajax, right?
[12:54:22] <Pazician> that would be soo easier...
[12:54:24] <robertmaxrees> "loop the form"?
[12:54:29] <robertmaxrees> without context i'm really lost
[12:54:50] <Pazician> yeah, it's basically a loop that's looping through the messages the inbox, basically
[12:55:01] <Pazician> you get a touch?
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:55:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any loops in here.
[12:55:50] <Pazician> no, it's rendered in a different file
[12:56:00] <Pazician> this is just the script.js
[12:56:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> so is the issue with this code or with code somewhere else?
[12:57:41] <Pazician> the issue is in the ajax function, I got a new idea I think I got it tho
[12:57:48] <Pazician> I'll let you know
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> lol 'k.
[12:58:00] <Pazician> sorry for the mess, lol
[13:50:47] <napz> hello all
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[13:51:57] <taplar> i could go for one of him
[13:53:39] <napz> can someone help me with this https://jsfiddle.net/mrnapz/noetx1wd/2/ if i use !google works good, but if i use !google DESIREDQUERY i get the link but not the query after the search?q=
[13:53:42] <napz> thanks.
[13:54:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you passing to it?
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where you call that function and what data gets passed to it napz
[13:56:54] <taplar> pretty sure your message.indexOf(query) is looking for an index of an empty string
[13:57:17] <robertmaxrees> message.indexOf(query) can return 0 if the string starts with that.
[13:57:31] <taplar> starts with "" ?
[13:57:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah something weird is going on here.
[13:57:55] <taplar> all strings start with "", :P
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> sooo some more details would be nice.
[13:58:30] <napz> im newbie guys xD i just learned 2 days ago jquery
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> right, so what are you sending to that function?
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> also: none of the code you're asking about is usin jquery fwiw :)
[13:59:40] <napz> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/mrnapz/noetx1wd/3/
[13:59:43] <napz> here is the full code
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> show the html, too.
[14:00:09] <napz> ok sec
[14:01:23] <taplar> ok, so we really need to talk about scope
[14:01:37] <taplar> your trying to use variables from one function in another
[14:01:56] <taplar> if you do a var someVariable in a method, it will only be scoped to that, and nested, functions
[14:02:47] <taplar> or i thought you were with previousState
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> so newmessage is the value of a textbox.
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> what's the story with query = "";?
[14:03:45] <napz> https://jsfiddle.net/mrnapz/noetx1wd/5/ (i know that its a bit confusing but im newbie like i said)
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, back up.
[14:04:00] <robertmaxrees> what's with query = "";?
[14:04:22] <napz> query = what user write after !google
[14:04:23] <napz> xD
[14:04:35] <taplar> no, your defining it up above that
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> right, so do you see the problem in your ai function?\]
[14:04:39] <taplar> var query = ""
[14:04:46] <robertmaxrees> your're setting it to an empty string.
[14:05:35] <napz> so it must go indexOf?
[14:05:46] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[14:07:13] <taplar> in that logic, not in a broad sense
[14:09:42] <taplar> how are things with you rob?
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> they're okayish.  the hits just keep on coming for us.  we're hoping that this upcoming vacation will give us a chance to relax.
[14:11:07] <taplar> good deal
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> we can hope heh.
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> you?
[14:11:16] <taplar> going any where exciting?
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> europe!
[14:11:27] <taplar> i'm looking into getting a roffer
[14:11:31] <taplar> that's sweet
[14:11:43] <taplar> swinging by germany?
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> nah.  paris, florence, and rome.
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> i did berlin for a night once.
[14:12:42] <taplar> awww.  i was going to say a friend who was stationed over there with her husband had some pictures of this one flower garden/park place that was large and amazing.
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> oh?  which?
[14:13:10] <taplar> i'll have to find the pics on fb
[14:13:25] <robertmaxrees> we plan on going again at some point to prague which is nearby so maybe we add that to the list :)
[14:15:48] <taplar> ok, lol, i meant holland
[14:15:53] <robertmaxrees> oh hahahahaha
[14:16:09] <taplar> keukenhof holland
[14:17:48] <taplar> they take their flower seriously
[14:31:47] <Pazician> why the heck does this not work? https://pastee.org/ws77d
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes "up"
[14:32:56] <robertmaxrees> it starts and the current element then looks for the first ancestor that matches that selector and stops
[14:33:24] <robertmaxrees> you want .closest('.messages-wrapper').find('.send-msg-wrap')
[14:34:15] <Pazician> so basically like this? $(this).closest('.messages-wrapper').find('.send-msg-wrap');
[14:34:25] <Pazician> but when I try that line it still doesn't work
[14:34:39] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle and show me.
[14:36:01] <joaocastanho> $("input[name=id_trade]").val() this returns always same value
[14:36:15] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[14:36:24] <joaocastanho> talking to me?
[14:36:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah :)
[14:36:32] <joaocastanho> oh ok :D
[14:36:37] <joaocastanho> jsfiddle?
[14:36:40] <robertmaxrees> please
[14:36:43] <joaocastanho> ok
[14:37:25] <joaocastanho> jsfiddle is slow in here, will do in jsbin
[14:39:36] <joaocastanho> it will take just few more minutes
[14:39:59] <taplar> there's only one input field with that name, right?
[14:41:29] <robertmaxrees> Pazician
[14:41:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xh4g2Lqn/
[14:41:44] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.  are you maybe adding .msg-anchor dynamically?
[14:42:36] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I'm looping through the content with PHP
[14:42:46] <robertmaxrees> php has nothing to do with JS ;)
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[14:42:55] <Pazician> I thought so
[14:43:03] <Pazician> no idea why it's not working out for me
[14:43:21] <robertmaxrees> have you put a console log inside that handler?
[14:43:42] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's actually getting called?
[14:43:56] <Pazician> yeah, it's just like the .send-msg-wrap doesn't excists
[14:44:12] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're adding/removing the right class?
[14:44:26] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($(this).closest('.messages-wrapper').find('.send-msg-wrap').length);
[14:44:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:44:44] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees: there?
[14:45:00] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho huh?
[14:45:05] <joaocastanho> http://jsbin.com/kivowisuti
[14:45:09] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: 1
[14:45:14] <joaocastanho> check checkbox inside modal
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> Pazician then your styles are bad.
[14:45:20] <joaocastanho> and you'll see
[14:45:24] <Pazician> css?
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you're probably toggling a class that doesn't do what you think it does.
[14:46:02] <Pazician> but it should add in the HTML
[14:46:02] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho yeah, you're selectying the same input every time.
[14:46:15] <joaocastanho> diff modals
[14:46:19] <taplar> :)
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> Pazician huh?  are you toggling a class or doing somethign else?
[14:46:27] <taplar> your not contextualizing your lookups
[14:46:37] <taplar> $() is a global selector
[14:46:40] <Pazician> when I toggle the class it should add the clas sin the HTML document right?
[14:46:41] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho right but $("input[name=id_cromo_troca]") is global.
[14:46:44] <robertmaxrees> it's selecting ALL of them.
[14:46:48] <taplar> and val() will only give you the first one
[14:46:52] <taplar> if there are multiple
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> Pazician sort of?
[14:47:01] <robertmaxrees> Pazician how are you verifying that?
[14:47:08] <Pazician> inspecting the doc
[14:47:26] <joaocastanho> yeah, so I know $(this) would help, but how?
[14:47:38] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho $(this) is the checked box, right?
[14:47:51] <taplar> alert($(this).closest('.modal-body').find("input[name=id_cromo_troca]").val());
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you're not, like, binding more than once, right?
[14:47:51] <taplar> });
[14:47:59] <taplar> bah, copied too much
[14:48:11] <robertmaxrees> alsO: use the "change" event instead of "click"
[14:48:27] <joaocastanho> gorgeous taplar ;)
[14:48:32] <joaocastanho> thanks a lot
[14:48:40] <taplar> get what it's doing?
[14:51:26] <joaocastanho> Yeah, it finds the value on the input, that's in the closest modal-body xD
[14:51:34] <joaocastanho> right?
[14:51:44] <robertmaxrees> do you know what .closest() does?
[14:52:30] <joaocastanho> it's like a loop through all of the modal-body and through the DOM it will check which one it is
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:52:41] <robertmaxrees> not in the slightest..
[14:52:43] <taplar> heh
[14:52:50] <joaocastanho> then explain it better
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> it starts at the current element and goes up until it finds the element that matches that selector :)
[14:53:24] <joaocastanho> well, I said it in another words
[14:53:37] <taplar> no, you said 'all of the modal-body'
[14:53:37] <robertmaxrees> totally different :)
[14:53:54] <taplar> it only checks parent elements, there is no 'all'
[14:54:08] <joaocastanho> ah right
[14:54:11] <joaocastanho> I get it
[14:54:15] <robertmaxrees> and there's no real "loop"
[14:54:26] <joaocastanho> yeah, because it's the nearest or closest
[14:54:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah sort of.
[14:54:39] <joaocastanho> ;)
[14:55:10] <taplar> recursion if anything
[14:55:32] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:57:18] <joaocastanho> You guys are Pro's
[14:57:31] <taplar> i'm not a hooker yo
[14:57:48] <taplar> came off a little sharp for a joke.... dang
[14:57:49] <joaocastanho> hey yo
[14:57:55] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[15:01:16] * taplar quickly saw joaocastanho's excitement turn to disgust
[15:01:26] * taplar much like with a prost....
[15:01:41] <taplar> there it is
[15:02:33] <ciss> is there a fairly straight-forward way to modify certain calls to $.fn.animate()? in particular i need to alter the collection if e.g. code tries to animate scrollTop using the common "html, body".
[15:03:06] <robertmaxrees> there's no real "modifying".  there's "replacing" ;)
[15:03:21] <ciss> *sigh* alright, decorating it is. :)
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> you could extend jquery with your own versions those.
[15:03:32] <taplar> are you trying to keep it from scrollTop with html or body?
[15:03:34] <robertmaxrees> *of those
[15:04:34] <ciss> taplar: html/body arent scrollable containers in our theme. instead to achieve the same effect a particular container has to be targeted. i'm trying to monkey-patch stuff so that existing code works out of the box.
[15:05:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd just go ahead and fix the calls that are broken.
[15:05:11] <ciss> not possible
[15:05:19] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[15:05:20] <ciss> not our ocde
[15:05:21] <ciss> *code
[15:05:28] <robertmaxrees> 3rd party?
[15:05:35] <ciss> yep
[15:05:43] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[15:06:21] <taplar> so, not being scrollable, does that mean they are less than 100vh?
[15:06:25] <ciss> also, that code isn't necessarily "broken", it's more like our theme introduces a structure that is incompatible with common implementations
[15:07:25] <ciss> taplar: they simply are on height: 100%. the overflow: auto is set on an inner container.
[15:07:59] <taplar> ok, so it's not like there is a scroll happening that you don't want to happen.  it's that it's trying to scroll something that is not scrollable, instead of just scrolling the thing you want it to scroll
[15:08:15] <ciss> taplar: exactly :)
[15:08:39] <taplar> so.... that just seems like a non issue.  just need to setup your events for when you want to scroll the other thing.
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something else is doing the binding.
[15:09:16] <ciss> guys, i'll just decorate .animate(). really, it's fine. thanks for your feedback.
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> "decorate" meanind replace?
[15:09:34] <robertmaxrees> *meaning
[15:09:37] <ciss> wrap, alter, call the original.
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> heh different streokes i guess.
[15:10:04] <robertmaxrees> goddamn i can't type today.
[15:10:16] <taplar> oh no, i'm affecting others
[15:10:19] <ciss> it's not like i'm completely replacing the implementation, i'm just putting one more layer in between :)
[15:10:54] <robertmaxrees> heh, sort of.  i'd just fix the original calls or replace the components that aren't meeting my needs any more.  even if that means having to replace large chunks of code.
[15:11:08] <robertmaxrees> gremlins always show up whenever i see people do that sort of stuff.
[15:11:34] <taplar> and not gizmo
[15:17:07] <notchris> On submit, I
[15:17:36] <notchris> I’m trying to maintain a character in a search string that would otherwise be encoded
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> what's the character?
[15:17:54] <notchris> %2B should stay “%2B” and not “+”
[15:18:03] <notchris> But it seems to encode it everytime
[15:18:12] <taplar> decode?
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:18:34] <notchris> Hmm
[15:18:43] <taplar> if you want it to stay, you'd have to encode your %
[15:18:47] <taplar> or don't decode
[15:18:49] <robertmaxrees> show us your code ;)
[15:19:57] <notchris> https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/0fzxbko3/
[15:20:05] <notchris> Haha sorry robertmaxrees
[15:20:13] <taplar> right, so encode your %
[15:20:27] <notchris> That’s how im trying to decode whats being sent
[15:20:43] <taplar> no, decode changed %## to the single char
[15:20:50] <taplar> *changes
[15:21:10] <notchris> basically, i want to replace spaces in the search string with literal %2B
[15:21:16] <notchris> So the string would be
[15:21:18] <robertmaxrees> then replace the spaced.
[15:21:20] <robertmaxrees> *spaces.
[15:21:26] <notchris> The%2BKinks
[15:21:37] <taplar> i thought a space was %20
[15:21:39] <notchris> But it turns the %2B’s into +
[15:21:49] <notchris> Which I do not want
[15:21:51] <robertmaxrees> $('input[id="keyword"]').val().replace(/ /g, '%2B');
[15:22:12] <robertmaxrees> or .split(' ') and .join('%2B');
[15:22:14] <notchris> If i do that within the submit function, will it use the modified input value
[15:22:23] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[15:22:36] <notchris> If I use the replace function on the input value, inside of the submit function
[15:22:40] <robertmaxrees> ....
[15:22:43] <notchris> Will it submit the modified input value
[15:22:47] <robertmaxrees> you're still grabbing the value the same way.
[15:22:54] <robertmaxrees> so... yeah?
[15:23:08] <notchris> Ah okay, sorry
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> not sure why it wouldn't.
[15:23:32] <taplar> yeah, space is %20...
[15:23:49] <robertmaxrees> taplar some places use +
[15:24:12] <notchris> Weird it still is using
[15:24:13] <notchris> http://localhost/bandcamp/index.php?artist=Grazie+Mille
[15:24:17] <notchris> On submit
[15:24:20] <notchris> I did...
[15:24:22] <taplar> can't see your localhost yo
[15:24:34] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle and stuff.
[15:24:36] <robertmaxrees> make a more fleshed out example.
[15:25:04] <notchris> http://puu.sh/pbQHE/bbd297ff65.png
[15:25:13] <notchris> Ah sorry, i just saw that, Im on sbux wifi
[15:25:14] <notchris> :/
[15:25:17] <robertmaxrees> er...
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:25:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not doing anything with the string.
[15:25:37] <taplar> *persistently
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> you're just getting a string and doing stuff with it but nothing with the final result.
[15:25:44] <notchris> Right, only modifying the input value
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:25:52] <notchris> That’s what i was confused about
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaaaaaaaaaay up
[15:26:29] <robertmaxrees> so what you're doing there just modifies the string, not the input.  you gotta pass that to a .val() call.
[15:27:10] <notchris> $('input[id="keyword"]').val(string);
[15:27:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:27:15] <notchris> and string is the replace function
[15:27:15] <notchris> kk
[15:27:16] <taplar> and small side note, just do '#keyword' for the selector
[15:27:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:27:31] <notchris> Wow
[15:27:36] <notchris> It worked
[15:27:37] <robertmaxrees> never use attribute selectors for IDs and Classes.
[15:27:41] <notchris> Woo, ty robertmaxrees taplar
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> notchris get why it wasn't working?
[15:27:55] <notchris> I do now yes
[15:28:13] <notchris> Also here’s a random question I was pondering
[15:28:15] <z1haze_work> ive been fkin with a sticky header for about an hour now, is there some generalized logic that can prevent glitching a sticky object when a page not quite tall enough to have it stick?
[15:28:31] <robertmaxrees> notchris sup?
[15:28:39] <z1haze_work> its like whne the header goes fixed, its taken out of flow which shortens the page further and then causes the glitching
[15:29:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that can happen.  any reason you're not using one of the dozens of sticky header plugins out there?
[15:29:11] <notchris> Basically, if you have the option to be more specific on a selector, is that preferred?
[15:29:19] <robertmaxrees> notchris really depends.
[15:29:23] <notchris> Ah OK
[15:29:30] <robertmaxrees> $('#someId') is all you want.
[15:29:39] <robertmaxrees> that's actually faster than $('.someParent #someId')
[15:29:49] <z1haze_work> im told we have to keep the libs and js to a minimum due to having a lot of js that runs the backend, or something i dunno
[15:29:53] <notchris> Ah OK, so there is a speed difference in how you setup your selector
[15:29:59] <robertmaxrees> notchris because it short-circuits to document.getElementById();
[15:30:13] <notchris> Right, that makes sense
[15:30:19] <taplar> and unless your doing something fancy, they both get the same result
[15:30:24] <robertmaxrees> also: css selectors don't work the way people think they do.
[15:30:32] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: im trying to calculate something like if($(document).outerHeight() / ($('body').outerHeight() - $cache.headerHeight > 1) { ... then stick but maybe im wrong because its not working how i want it to?
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i have no idea without seeing mang.  sorry.
[15:30:56] <notchris> I feel like ID’s dont always seem to be necessary
[15:31:01] <z1haze_work> its not passworded but can i pm you a link
[15:31:04] <taplar> z1haze: so your header doesn't start of sticky?
[15:31:05] <notchris> But I’m sure there are times when they are useful
[15:31:11] <z1haze_work> correct
[15:31:14] <notchris> (In CSS)
[15:31:18] <taplar> does it start off positioned at all?
[15:31:23] <robertmaxrees> notchris a search bar could use an ID - you only have one on the page.
[15:31:25] <z1haze_work> i didnt build it but it starts out in normal flow
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> notchris a more valid case to ask about would be $('.someChild') vs $('.someParent .someChild');
[15:31:51] <robertmaxrees> the "best" one would be $('.someParent').find('.someChild');
[15:32:06] <notchris> Hmm that is interesting
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> basically, stuffing stuff into $('.thisArea .rightHere') is actually a bad idea.
[15:32:17] <taplar> one thing you might try then.  change it to positioned absolute and then that will force you put put a margin-top on your content to make it appear below it.  then when you change to position fixed, your body shouldn't be affected
[15:32:24] <notchris> And it looks a little weird too
[15:32:46] <robertmaxrees> it can.  a HUGE help is to make sure your markup is semantic.
[15:32:48] <taplar> more of a css question at that point though
[15:32:51] <z1haze_work> yea
[15:32:56] <notchris> Does .children() work like .find() in a way?
[15:32:57] <z1haze_work> i should be able to calculate this though
[15:33:04] <notchris> Or is it direct children
[15:33:06] <notchris> compared to find
[15:33:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:33:14] <notchris> Ahhh
[15:33:15] <robertmaxrees> also: https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[15:33:28] <notchris> So $(‘.someParent > .someChild’)
[15:33:32] <notchris> is like using .children()
[15:33:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  direct descendent.
[15:33:43] <robertmaxrees> check out that page.
[15:33:49] <robertmaxrees> though there's one MASSIVE caveat in all of this.
[15:33:54] <notchris> Hmm
[15:34:03] <z1haze_work> i should be able to compare with if($(document).outerHeight() / ($('body').outerHeight() - $cache.headerHeight > 1) right? basically saying if viewable window size / body actual size - the header height that im going to stick > 1?
[15:34:06] <robertmaxrees> write code that reads easier first.
[15:34:12] <robertmaxrees> z1haze make a fiddle pls.
[15:34:16] <z1haze_work> will try
[15:34:37] <robertmaxrees> notchris if you have perf issues, selectors aren't likely to be the culprit unless you're doing something really weird.
[15:34:57] <robertmaxrees> avoid the sizzle/jquery selector extensiong and use vanilla stuff when possible.
[15:35:09] <notchris> Sounds good, thank you for that advice
[15:35:22] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  people forget that all the time.
[15:35:24] <notchris> Also, robertmaxrees , I’ll push what I have so far live to show you
[15:36:26] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://chrismcgrane.com/bandcamp/
[15:36:29] <notchris> (meant for mobile view)
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> oh this thing.
[15:36:48] <notchris> I got saved lists working
[15:36:53] <notchris> And cleaned up the UI a lot
[15:37:22] <robertmaxrees> nice.
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> i'll take a look later if i get some time.
[15:38:11] <notchris> Haha OK, ty robertmaxrees
[15:38:16] <notchris> Hope u have a good day man
[15:38:20] <robertmaxrees> :) sorry, crazy busy day.
[15:38:59] <robertmaxrees> gotta get everything buttoned up for my trip.
[15:44:32] <z1haze_work> ugh its so hard to duplicate in a fiddle they have so much bs in here
[15:44:43] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page then?
[15:46:04] <robertmaxrees> z1haze otherwise, how small do you need to make the window for it to break?
[15:46:35] <candelabra> if I have a $.get request bound to a .change event of a select box, what's the best way to abort the previous $.get request if the user changes the select before the first request completes?
[15:47:20] <robertmaxrees> candelabra any reason you can't prevent input instead?
[15:47:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, check out http://stackoverflow.com/a/446626
[15:48:05] <candelabra> robertmaxrees: well the select is a multiple select and the idea is to allow multiple but to search on change instead of submit/button, so we dont' want to prevent input
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> heh we have plenty of places where we just prevent input, but fair enough.
[16:05:59] <Sal> is it faster if I add a class to assign styles, or if I set them with a .css() call ?
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> just use a class.
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> get your CSS out of your CS>
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> *JS
[16:08:06] <Sal> i need to speed optimize
[16:08:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:08:33] <robertmaxrees> .css() vs .addClass() won't make a difference in perf really.
[16:08:51] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a particular style giving you a headache.
[16:09:14] <Sal> no, its code that i need to execute on the scroll event
[16:09:17] <Sal> and on mobile
[16:09:28] <robertmaxrees> addClass vs css won't make a difference.
[16:09:29] <Sal> so i donm't want the page to jump while touchmoving it
[16:09:42] <robertmaxrees> there are other things that CAN make a difference though.
[16:09:51] <Sal> but doesn't add Class do more things?
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:10:16] <Sal> i mean, with css, it assigns styles to dom
[16:10:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna argue, feel free.
[16:10:24] <Sal> with addclass, it first has to load the class
[16:10:25] <Sal> no?
[16:10:30] <robertmaxrees> "load the class"?
[16:10:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:10:37] <robertmaxrees> the CSSOM already has the class.
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> you're doing a small string comparison.
[16:10:47] <Sal> ok, never mind, just wanted to go deeper into it
[16:10:55] <robertmaxrees> but the perf difference between those two is negligible, if at all.
[16:11:08] <Sal> ok
[16:11:26] <Sal> i cached all i could have...
[16:11:30] <robertmaxrees> the browser already has all of the styles loaded though.
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> are you still getting perf issues?>
[16:12:10] <Sal> on iOS, they told me that page hangs
[16:12:21] <Sal> i know its the scroll event
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the code that's performing poorly then?
[16:12:28] <Sal> i should use a timer
[16:12:45] <Sal> yes, i'll put it online
[16:12:48] <Sal> gimme 2 secs
[16:12:48] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> back.
[16:27:40] <Sal> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/rgvaeskz/1/
[16:27:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:28:06] <Sal> i know that the bottleneck is on the scroll event
[16:28:15] <robertmaxrees> i can tell you exactly what your problems are.
[16:28:18] <Sal> but i can't find another way to do it
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> a few big issues.
[16:28:34] <Sal> what?
[16:28:44] <Sal> wow! big?
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> 1. you're not properly caching anything.
[16:28:48] <Sal> its that bad?
[16:28:49] <Sal> hehehe
[16:28:56] <robertmaxrees> doing var st = $(window).scrollTop(); inside the handler doesn't make any sense.
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> you're making it rerun that code.
[16:29:26] <Sal> i did cache some stuff
[16:29:27] <robertmaxrees> do var $window = $(window); outside of the handler and then use that for your scrolltop.
[16:29:35] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[16:29:36] <Sal> like initial positions and the elements
[16:29:37] <ExoUNX> so when I click a radio button, what's the best way to make an image appear on the next page load (page reloads on radio buttom click)
[16:29:58] <robertmaxrees> Sal erm, i think you misunderstood what that means.
[16:30:02] <Sal> robertmaxrees, ok, let me work on it
[16:30:17] <Sal> also, i found that there are 14 pixels of difference usingjsfiddle
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX you'd need to add a param or something to the querystring and then the server would render that out.
[16:30:27] <robertmaxrees> Sal slow down.
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> couple more problems.
[16:30:37] <Sal> hehehe
[16:30:38] <robertmaxrees> $('.header').each(function (idx, el) {
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> do you add or remove any $('.header') ?
[16:30:53] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, there documentation or an example so I can see how it works
[16:31:03] <Sal> nothing
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX for which part?
[16:31:14] <Sal> i'm just passing them to check their top
[16:31:22] <robertmaxrees> Sal right - same thing as the window object then.  also, that .each() is killing you.
[16:31:28] <Sal> they're already in html
[16:31:31] <Sal> i just add a wrapper
[16:31:41] <robertmaxrees> right, so select ahead of time and then use that var.
[16:31:43] <Sal> oh
[16:31:45] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, loading an element with onclick() or something
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> Sal what is that each handler doing?
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX you said the next pageload.
[16:32:21] <Sal> ok, robert... too many things... let me first start fixing it up
[16:32:22] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, yah so I would have a hidden element but when the radio button is active to unhide it
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX you said on the next page load.
[16:32:37] <robertmaxrees> so is the image on the same page or another page?
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> Sal it looks like you're trying to get the current heading and have that stick to the top of the page, right?
[16:33:19] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, well I'd like to store the html needed on the same page but on unhide when the radio button is selected
[16:33:28] <ExoUNX> only unhide*
[16:33:37] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX that's totally different from your initial request :)
[16:33:48] <Sal> yep, stick it to a vertical position
[16:34:01] <Sal> so it has to be a variable
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> Sal that's a really bad way to do this.
[16:34:15] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, it is specifically but both methods should accomplish the same thing
[16:34:30] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, is that more of a js question?
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX except they're two totally different things.
[16:34:32] <Sal> ok, what about starting like this: var $headers = $('.header');
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> javascript/jquery doesn't carry over from one page to the next.
[16:34:50] <Sal> so i use the array instead of the query inside the scroll handler
[16:35:02] <robertmaxrees> Sal *jquery object, and yeah.
[16:35:18] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, right so it would have to check if the radio button is active and if it is display the image
[16:35:21] <Sal> anyway, thanks for your help and tips, all start changing now
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX yeah, for the on-page one yeah.
[16:35:43] <Sal> brb
[16:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX that's a change event handler in that case.
[16:36:27] <Sal> robertmaxrees, what should i use instead of each() ? you said its bad to use it
[16:36:37] <Sal> a for() loop?
[16:36:46] <robertmaxrees> never use for loops when working with jquery objects.
[16:36:52] <Sal> oh
[16:37:01] <robertmaxrees> Sal you want to optimize that to .filter() down to the element(s) you want instead and THEN do all your calculations.
[16:37:01] <Sal> then eq() ?
[16:37:06] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, I'm here - https://api.jquery.com/change/
[16:37:17] <Sal> ok
[16:37:20] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX right, or you could use .on('change', function() {});
[16:37:22] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, any example more specific?
[16:37:22] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[16:37:26] <Sal> brb
[16:37:34] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX are you looking for a beginner's guide to jquery?
[16:38:14] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, no, I just wanted to see a better example of the functions
[16:38:31] <napz> ExoUNX: me too xD
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> if you scroll down a big on that page, you can see the examples there.
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> "The event handler can be bound to the text input and the select box:" - right below that.
[16:39:02] <napz> i think i create new functions too like var query =  message.indexOf($(this).text()); xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:39:30] <napz> madness :|
[16:40:02] * taplar whispers "that's not a function"
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:40:09] <napz> i know xD
[16:40:29] <napz> well, i tried 50 ways
[16:40:35] <napz> but i will not give up
[16:40:43] <taplar> what was the problem?
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX so where are you getting stuck?
[16:40:51] <taplar> iirc we asked what you were trying to do in that method
[16:41:53] <napz> taplar: im learning jquery it's normal to make stupid stuff xD https://jsfiddle.net/mrnapz/x3hxbkku/
[16:42:14] <taplar> but... what are you trying to do?
[16:42:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:42:24] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[16:42:24] <napz> im just trying to add a query from indexof
[16:42:29] <napz> for hours \o/
[16:42:42] <taplar> your getting a string of like '!google something&weeee'
[16:42:46] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> message.indexOf($(this).text()) is going to give you a number.
[16:43:00] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to make a chat bot.
[16:43:00] <napz> i get 0
[16:43:06] <napz> yes robertmaxrees
[16:43:11] <taplar> right, but is he trying to split it, verify the format, etc?
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> he wants to get the text after '!google '
[16:43:24] <napz> a query
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> string.
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> you want a substring.
[16:43:45] <napz> ah
[16:43:55] <napz> ok
[16:44:12] <taplar> check if it starts with '!google ', and then slice the mofo on 8
[16:44:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX something tells me you're looking for a fleshed-out example, yeah?
[16:45:46] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, nope
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> then what're you looking for?
[16:46:01] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, however I might just address this through the backend
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to for that second pagelaod thing.
[16:46:24] <robertmaxrees> the initial page bit is pretty easy.
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lw93d45c/1/
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:47:33] <ExoUNX> robertmaxrees, that helps and thanks
[16:48:03] <robertmaxrees> your second pageload thing will need you to add a querystring param or something so the server knows what's up.
[16:51:05] <taplar> napz: https://jsfiddle.net/x3hxbkku/1/
[16:54:29] <taplar> see if that illuminates any lightbulbs
[17:03:39] * crickets chirps
[17:19:53] <Sal> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/rgvaeskz/3/
[17:19:58] <Sal> now its better
[17:20:06] <Sal> i cached window and all the headers
[17:20:42] <taplar> you should look into throttling your scroll
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> now just use classes instead for readability.
[17:20:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:20:46] <Sal> i have to keep the st = win.scrolltop() inside the scroll handler because i need to know the scrolltop position
[17:20:47] <robertmaxrees> throttle
[17:21:06] <Sal> taplar, ? thta means?
[17:21:17] <taplar> when you scroll, the scroll event fires a ton of times
[17:21:17] <robertmaxrees> var status = cache[idx].status; what't up with that cacge array dealio?
[17:21:33] <Sal> robertmaxrees, thats a "home made" filtering
[17:21:35] <Sal> :)
[17:21:43] <taplar> depending on how you want to approach it, throttling ensures that the scroll event only fires so often
[17:21:43] <Sal> with that i exclude elements
[17:21:43] <robertmaxrees> just use .filter() with a jquery object.
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange roundabout way to do that.
[17:22:13] <taplar> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[17:22:15] <Sal> aint it faster to jusy check a var instead of executing a function inside a filter?
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> Sal you still need a function...
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> plus your way requires you to do $elPrev = $(cache[idx - 1].el); - that's bad.
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> shouldn'nt need to generate the object on the fly.
[17:23:04] <Sal> i execute that only if status = 2
[17:23:08] <Sal> i think, or 1
[17:23:10] <robertmaxrees> back way up
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting the top like this in the first place?
[17:23:23] <robertmaxrees> why not just set position: fixed;?
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> this whole setup seems really awkward.
[17:23:45] <Sal> because, the headers have to stay at the topmost of the list
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:03] <Sal> and the list, has its top, depending on an auto hiding application bar
[17:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to swap out which one is at top when you scroll?
[17:24:28] <Sal> ?
[17:24:42] <Sal> not understand you, i thought you wanted to know another thing, sorry
[17:24:53] <robertmaxrees> why don't you just set position: fixed; on the headings?
[17:25:25] <Sal> i need the next one to swipe out the previous
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> throttling this will look pretty gross.
[17:25:40] <Sal> someone here is a fanatic iOS user
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah solve that problem separately.
[17:26:16] <taplar> :)
[17:26:17] <robertmaxrees> the swap animation i mean.
[17:26:47] <Sal> i just do it switching fixed and putting the previous header in absolute
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> that lets you skipp 95% of this code.
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> which is what you want.
[17:27:27] <robertmaxrees> you can solve the animated swapout thing separately.
[17:27:41] <Sal> robertmaxrees, how?
[17:27:45] <Sal> gimme an idea?
[17:27:52] <Sal> you mean using css animation?
[17:28:19] <Sal> i need a pixel-scrollbar relation over that
[17:28:28] <robertmaxrees> you could append the current heading to a fixed container and then animate the swap.
[17:28:29] <Sal> i can't let it go by itsef
[17:28:33] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to approach it.
[17:29:20] <Sal> animation means an async process
[17:29:29] <taplar> any reason only some of your logic is in a doc ready?
[17:29:32] <robertmaxrees> you could do it via jquery instead.
[17:29:33] <Sal> i need to keep it synced witht he scrolling
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> like i said, there are a few different ways to do it.
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> and will fix your performance problems.
[17:30:07] <Sal> taplar: just a testing, i have to make a plugin out iof it at the end
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you want the fixed position dealio.
[17:30:38] <Sal> robertmaxrees, i would be very glad if i could get the idea
[17:30:43] <robertmaxrees> "get the idea"?
[17:30:53] <Sal> but i don't see how i can keep the animation synced with scrolling
[17:31:44] <Sal> anyway, what i'm doing is only changing 2 elements styles
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> and still runs poorly ;)
[17:32:08] <robertmaxrees> on scroll, subtract/add that much from the height of the top one.  when it's 0, remove it.
[17:32:17] <Sal> you tested it on iphone?
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> did you?
[17:32:40] <robertmaxrees> you didn't resolve all of your perf problems soooo.
[17:32:54] <Sal> but i took out 2 queries!
[17:32:59] <Sal> and thats a lot a think
[17:33:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:10] <Sal> 2 queries in a scroll handler
[17:33:13] <Sal> :)
[17:33:20] <robertmaxrees> i've been doing this for long enough to tell you that you're going to keep running into issues.
[17:33:48] <Sal> damn
[17:34:04] <Sal> so, for you, the next thing to do is the animation?
[17:34:10] <taplar> throttle
[17:34:21] <robertmaxrees> the throttle will make it look like it's stuttering.
[17:34:22] <Sal> damn, let me read what that tuttle is
[17:34:24] <Sal> hehehe
[17:34:29] <Sal> turtle
[17:34:30] <Sal> :)
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> you asked about animations and said you needed them locked with the scroll, so i gave you another option.
[17:35:14] <Sal> oh a timer
[17:35:21] <Sal> i already has that on
[17:35:26] <Sal> and deleted it
[17:35:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't need one.
[17:35:42] <Sal> i was also thinking on putting a timer for headers with top > x
[17:35:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> that'll make it look like it's stuttering, but OK.
[17:36:03] <Sal> and for the ones with top < x, to go directly into scroll handler
[17:36:09] <taplar> poor mans throttle, heh https://jsfiddle.net/rgvaeskz/4/
[17:36:53] <Sal> taplar, the problem is on mobile
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:37:03] <Sal> when you touch swipe up fastly
[17:37:19] <taplar> try that and see if anything changes
[17:38:12] <mmmveggies> mmm, swipe fastly...
[17:38:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:38:41] <taplar> sonic is the master of fastly food
[17:38:51] <mmmveggies> sanic
[17:38:56] <taplar> 'food'
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> in n out on the other hand...
[17:39:18] <Sal> taplar: badly i can't try it on an ios safari
[17:39:25] <Sal> or maybe luckly
[17:39:31] <robertmaxrees> Sal you can profile it instead.
[17:39:32] <taplar> oh dude, i'm backyard burgers, but they closed them near me.  it's an outrage
[17:39:33] <Sal> on android, its ok
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> Sal use the profiler in chrome.
[17:39:57] <Sal> robertmaxrees, you're too ahead for me man
[17:40:03] <Sal> i nevere used that tool
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> so then learn :)
[17:40:05] <Sal> hehe
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> doesn't take much.
[17:40:23] <Sal> can't you just do it and tell me the results?
[17:40:24] <Sal> :)
[17:40:32] <taplar> and next time you need to do it?
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> sure.  lemme get a contract up for you.
[17:40:38] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:40:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> really easy stuff.
[17:40:42] <Sal> hehehe
[17:40:49] <robertmaxrees> it'll make your job MUCH easier.
[17:41:21] <mmmveggies> https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> it's not as hard as you'd think.
[17:41:27] <Sal> only if you do it for the money i do it
[17:41:32] <Sal> i'm doing it for a friend
[17:41:35] <Sal> so $0
[17:41:36] <Sal> :)
[17:41:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't do free work ;)
[17:41:55] <Sal> its a friend
[17:42:00] <robertmaxrees> even for friends
[17:42:00] <Sal> i can't say no
[17:42:15] <robertmaxrees> gotta value your skills yo.
[17:42:34] <Sal> and i took it as a new challenge
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:42:57] <Sal> i knowe, but he's a real friend, i know him since kids
[17:43:20] <robertmaxrees> there's only one case that i might consider working for free on something, and even then...
[17:43:31] <taplar> friends - people you take advantage of, and who know it, and still like you
[17:43:32] <Sal> hehe
[17:44:23] <Sal> by the way, did anyone try profiling the 2 sources?
[17:44:25] <Sal> hehehe
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> working for free means they won't value the work as much as they should.  when something breaks, they'll come right back to you.
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do that dude.
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn how.
[17:44:45] <Sal> ok
[17:45:02] <Sal> inside this damn jsfiddle could be a problem i think
[17:45:06] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> do it on your dev environment.
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> not on jsfiddle.
[17:45:42] * Sal shhhh, i'm profiling
[17:45:42] <robertmaxrees> you need the actual site to do an accurate measurement.
[17:46:00] <Sal> nah, then i wont do it
[17:46:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:46:10] <Sal> this shit has to go inside a list that i don't have
[17:46:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:46:15] <Sal> so never mind
[17:46:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:46:26] <robertmaxrees> you're working on a site you don't have?
[17:46:30] <taplar> i need to create a website called 'racial' and have someone perform some chrome metrics on it
[17:46:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar hahahahahahahhaa
[17:46:54] <Sal> i'm only making a header stick plugin that lets you stick headers not only on top=0
[17:46:56] <Sal> thats all
[17:47:02] <Sal> i don't care about the rest
[17:47:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:47:09] <Sal> friens ok, but there are limits
[17:50:55] <Sal> robertmaxrees, returning to the animation you said to include... do you think it really could be faster to start an animation instead of changing styles?
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> dide
[17:51:07] <robertmaxrees> *dude
[17:51:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:51:20] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing what i said.  just forget it.
[17:51:27] <Sal> i know it was dude, didn't have to correct it
[17:51:28] <Sal> :)
[17:51:43] <Sal> oh
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:51:54] <Sal> let me read up then
[17:52:37] <taplar> oh snikies, i just noticed the wildcarded css rule
[17:53:18] <Sal>  on scroll, subtract/add that much from the height of the top one.  when it's 0, remove it.
[17:53:22] <Sal> was that?
[17:53:27] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, yeah.
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> there's gotta be a plugin for this.
[17:54:13] <Sal> oh, i got it... something like a roll-up
[17:54:16] <Sal> hmmm
[17:54:54] <Sal> so, i just keep them all fixed in position
[17:54:59] <Sal> interesting
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:55:25] <Sal> when 0 remove it
[17:55:35] <robertmaxrees> don't keep them all fixed.
[17:55:43] <Sal> oh
[17:55:46] <Sal> wait
[17:55:58] <robertmaxrees> http://bigspotteddog.github.io/ScrollToFixed/
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> here.
[17:56:05] <Sal> you're saying to not touch at all the original headers and just let them scroll under
[17:56:14] <robertmaxrees> there.  a plugin that'll do it.
[17:56:54] <Sal> there are a lot of plugin that stick headers
[17:57:01] <Sal> but all on top= 0
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> this one does exactly what you want.
[17:57:06] <taplar> look at the menu on the right hand side
[17:57:16] <Sal> hehe
[17:57:26] <Sal> sorry, let me see better
[17:57:32] <taplar> sorry, summaries
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:58:29] <Sal> yep, summay 1 and 2
[17:58:35] <robertmaxrees> exactly what you want.
[17:58:38] <Sal> let me see how they do it
[17:58:45] <Sal> maybe its worst than mine
[17:58:46] <robertmaxrees> it's a plugin.
[17:58:47] <Sal> hehehe
[17:58:53] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/bigspotteddog/ScrollToFixed
[17:59:00] <taplar> you'd still want to profile it possibly
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:59:15] <robertmaxrees> still check perf, but I'll bet it runs a fair bit better than yours.
[17:59:18] <Sal> taplar :)
[17:59:48] <Sal> robertmaxrees, thanks for the trust
[17:59:51] <Sal> :)
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:59:55] <taplar> but other than that, black box that sucker and put down your wheel chisel
[18:00:14] <Sal> checking
[18:00:16] <Sal> brb
[18:00:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:01:28] <Sal> it uses the same method, fixed-absolute-static
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> enjoy duder.
[18:03:03] <Sal> this guys aint caching either
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> and it may perform better (shrug)
[18:03:19] <Sal> line 282 and 289, he has 2 $(window) insiode the scroll handler
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> hah, yeah, this definitely has some optimizations in it.
[18:08:53] <taplar> is it typical of plugins to base their logic on their own triggered events?  for some reason I was thinking they'd avoid that internally, but trigger them for exposing hooks
[18:09:26] <robertmaxrees> not super common, but i'd bet he did that because he was originally bound to the window scroll.
[18:11:22] <taplar> i'm too lazy to try it but i wonder if this plugin would work within a scrollable div
[18:13:12] <taplar> any who, later all
[18:13:17] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeeee
[18:13:34] <Sal> ciao
[18:13:54] <deadhound> Hello, I am working on a site that when a user clicks an image it will take them to a profile for said image, pulling JSON data on that image from another website. To create these profiles jQuery will be used to create dynamic html pages. My question is - how would I design this dynamic HTML page? Pure jQuery that creates a file on the server? If that is correct, what happens to that file, since it will persist on the server, is it ju
[18:14:03] <robertmaxrees> hey that cut off.
[18:14:36] <robertmaxrees> deadhound it cut off at "If that is correct, what happens to that file, since it will persist on the server, is it ju"
[18:14:46] <deadhound> since it will persist on the server, is it just part of the site? Wouldn't a duplicate file continue to be made, etc? Is this a limitation of jQuery/javascript and i should use something like PHP instead? Any input would be greatly appreciated
[18:14:52] <deadhound> robertmaxrees did that go through?
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:15:00] <deadhound> thanks!
[18:15:03] <robertmaxrees> so you've got some misconceptions :)
[18:15:09] <robertmaxrees> 1: javascript cannot save anything to your server.
[18:15:10] <deadhound> Absolutely - cos I'm a nub hahahha
[18:15:20] <deadhound> OK so it would be dynamically made and then destroyed?
[18:15:24] <robertmaxrees> so you'd need a server-side language of some sort.  PHP, node, etc.
[18:15:32] <robertmaxrees> 2: jquery is a bad idea for something like this.
[18:15:50] <deadhound> Gotcha. I was trying to do as much prototyping without using a server as possible I suppose that's where the prototype ends
[18:15:54] <robertmaxrees> when the jquery does its thing, it only exists on that page.
[18:16:01] <robertmaxrees> 3: where are you pulling data from?
[18:16:15] <robertmaxrees> because depending on that, you may not be able to get away without a server at all.
[18:16:19] <deadhound> OK - so that's also part of the question - if I use PHP or something, the page would then be created on my site and persist - wouldn't that page be re-written as other users complete the same action?
[18:16:37] <robertmaxrees> deadhound that's why you wouldn't save an html file to disk.
[18:16:41] <deadhound> well I definitely have to use a server because I'm pulling data from another site
[18:16:44] <robertmaxrees> you'd create entries in a DB.
[18:16:49] <deadhound> AH ok
[18:16:57] <deadhound> then when that same page is requested you would pull the data from the db?
[18:17:00] <robertmaxrees> and then have information within the DB that ties each entry back to the user account.
[18:17:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:17:17] <robertmaxrees> so the user would log in, right?
[18:17:20] <deadhound> yup
[18:17:25] <deadhound> eventually
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that login would have some kind of unique ID tied to it - that's the same ID you'd then use in your profiledata db.
[18:18:08] <robertmaxrees> or table or w/e
[18:18:19] <deadhound> OK now here's a question about that
[18:18:43] <deadhound> haha - so the profile for the image would have common information all users could see, but there WOULD be specific info only the logged in user could see - data that would be customized
[18:18:57] <deadhound> what I'm trying to work out right now is the common info, because I don't plan on implementing logging in yet
[18:19:03] <robertmaxrees> so you don't store html.
[18:19:21] <deadhound> So keep it to php or node or something requesting data from the source website, but i would still need to store data in a db?
[18:20:01] <robertmaxrees> that's the other source for data?
[18:20:14] <deadhound> the imdb rest api
[18:20:49] <deadhound> so i plan on having profile pages for movies, which will pull specific data in the form of JSON from imdb
[18:21:20] <robertmaxrees> so you're just building a different frontend for IMDB - how to user accounts play in?
[18:21:22] <deadhound> that's where i'm stuck. when a user visits a movie page - what page would they be seeing? a .php, .html, etc because i clearly don't want every movie to have a saved profile on my server
[18:21:39] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating a few different things :)
[18:21:42] <deadhound> pretty much at this point that's what it is - the user accounts i don't need right now, that's much later
[18:21:47] <deadhound> probably
[18:21:48] <deadhound> haha
[18:22:01] <robertmaxrees> so php just makes html and sends that to the browser fwiw.
[18:22:03] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[18:22:08] <robertmaxrees> then you pull that data from IMDB each time.
[18:22:13] <robertmaxrees> instead of storing that yourself.
[18:22:21] <deadhound> gotcha gotcha ok ok
[18:22:21] <robertmaxrees> how will user accounts tie in later?
[18:22:35] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that might inform some other infrastructure ahead of time.
[18:22:46] <deadhound> that's tough because i don't know how much i can say right now
[18:22:51] <deadhound> could i pm you at least?
[18:23:05] <robertmaxrees> did you sign an NDA?
[18:23:12] <robertmaxrees> or something else that says you can't say?
[18:23:26] <robertmaxrees> because i could be publicly logging all my logs to the internet and you wouldn't know ;)
[18:23:44] <deadhound> well i don't plan on telling you anything specific and no i didn't sign anything like that
[18:23:54] <deadhound> it's a pet project
[18:24:15] <robertmaxrees> heh, well, depending on what you're planning on doing with user accounts, there are some things you might want to consider up front.
[18:24:19] <deadhound> basically think imdb for now
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> then why not just use imdb ;)
[18:24:41] <robertmaxrees> either way, just fetch from their API each time.
[18:24:43] <deadhound> so users can rate movies that's pretty much the basis what happens after that is different than imdb
[18:24:47] <robertmaxrees> i might put in a caching layer at some point.
[18:25:07] <robertmaxrees> does IMDB send back some kind of uniqueID for each movie?
[18:25:20] <deadhound> yes they have resource id's of sorts
[18:25:44] <robertmaxrees> you may need to consider storing each user's individual rating for each movie
[18:25:57] <deadhound> yes that's definitely something that would have to be stored in a db - correct?
[18:26:03] <deadhound> just to make sure i'm thinking it through properly
[18:26:09] <robertmaxrees> no other way to store it really.
[18:26:16] <deadhound> exactly ok just making sure
[18:26:51] <deadhound> so eventually there will definitely be a db and user accounts, etc. but right now just working towards getting the movie profile working with json data received from imdb
[18:27:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's all really simple.
[18:27:11] <deadhound> so i think you answered what i need to do - which is use php to create html pages that dynamically retrieve the data when requested
[18:27:14] <robertmaxrees> hell that's a pretty tiny app up on aws.
[18:27:18] <robertmaxrees> you could use node.
[18:27:20] <robertmaxrees> or python.
[18:27:26] <robertmaxrees> or pretty much any server-side language.
[18:27:26] <deadhound> i'm using cloud9 right now for prototyping
[18:27:36] <deadhound> i know python best so i was thinking going with that
[18:27:45] <robertmaxrees> that'd be stupid easy.
[18:27:47] <deadhound> though i'm not sure if php or node might be easier?
[18:27:54] <deadhound> yeah but i'm a noob robertmaxrees hahah
[18:28:06] <robertmaxrees> even then.
[18:28:07] <ashzade> Hello everyone. I have multiple instances of the same checkbox but my code to check if they're checked doesn't seem to check all of them http://pastebin.com/jUBNKAYU Any ideas how I can loop through all instances of one field?
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> python makes thgings like that easy deadhound
[18:28:21] <deadhound> gotcha so you think that over node or php?
[18:28:27] <robertmaxrees> that or node
[18:28:29] <deadhound> you think python over node or php*
[18:28:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid php, but up to you.
[18:28:39] <deadhound> haha
[18:28:40] <robertmaxrees> ashka make a jsfiddle instead?
[18:28:50] <deadhound> ok so node or python great i will start looking into that I really appreciate it! :D
[18:28:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[18:28:58] <robertmaxrees> and good luck :)
[18:29:02] <deadhound> thanks!
[18:29:21] <deadhound> well could you clarify why to avoid php? just wondering your more experienced opinion
[18:29:53] <deadhound> also do you know any good resource for understanding what you meant by caching layer? that is for the db, correct?
[18:30:15] <robertmaxrees> php's a really awkward language imo.  inconsistent.  confusing.  strange syntax choices.  i mean, it gets the job done and there's a reason it's so prevalent, but it's falling out of favor for good reason.
[18:30:24] <robertmaxrees> and the caching is more for calls to IMDB.
[18:30:43] <deadhound> hmm interesting so that's something i should be considering when looking at making the python > html stuff?
[18:30:45] <ashzade> oops nm, figured ir out
[18:30:45] <robertmaxrees> let's say 3 people look up info on Star Wars within a 15 minute period - why go fetch that data from IMDB each time?
[18:31:07] <deadhound> ooooh
[18:31:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:31:11] <deadhound> so cache that data for a time
[18:31:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd worry aboput that later though.
[18:31:30] <deadhound> OK good to know. i'm trying to get the necessities going as quickly as possible so i will keep that in mind for the future
[18:31:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, caching is a later problem.  build your MVP.
[18:32:00] <deadhound> most valuable program? haha
[18:32:09] <robertmaxrees> minimum viable product
[18:32:17] <deadhound> ah thanks
[18:34:05] <cvrebert> Is there any browser compatibility reason to use http://api.jquery.com/event.which/ over raw DOM MouseEvent.button ?
[18:34:51] <robertmaxrees> it may smooth over consistency issues between browsers.
[18:37:49] <cvrebert> robertmaxrees: "may" being the operative word. I'm trying to see if there's any concrete known issue it solves.
[18:38:23] <robertmaxrees> without dumping into the soruce code and looking, i don't know.
[18:39:10] <robertmaxrees> that being said, https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ - "jQuery's event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards. The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied over and normalized to the new event object."
[18:39:20] <Sal> robertmaxrees, night and thanks for the help and the "friendly" chat
[18:39:25] <robertmaxrees> "friendly"?
[18:39:35] <Sal> at least for me
[18:39:38] <Sal> :)
[18:39:54] <cvrebert> there's no enlightening comment in the relevant source code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L624
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> cvrebert 'kay.
[18:40:09] <robertmaxrees> just srying to point you in a direction (shrug)
[18:41:03] <robertmaxrees> there may be other normalization to other properties on that object fwiw.
[18:41:19] <robertmaxrees> looks like part of what it does is make sure all props exist.
[18:42:12] <robertmaxrees> and standard methods.
[18:43:04] <cvrebert> guess I need to find someone who might know the history behind it.
[18:43:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> sorry - you seem agitated with me.
[18:43:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[18:44:30] <cvrebert> I appreciate your attempt :)
[18:44:41] <robertmaxrees> out of curiosity - why?
[18:47:13] <robertmaxrees> i would think that having that object there is plenty convenient.
[18:47:24] <fnodeuser> hi, how can i make '--js-flags=--expose-gc' work to be able to initiate garbage collection manually from the console? i'm using the latest stable chrome version, entering window.gc() or gc() just makes the console to display 'undefined'
[18:48:05] <cvrebert> want to see if we can use vanilla DOM and MouseEvent.button instead of jQuery event.which in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/5dcd1a743dfdca0464099bc52fe4675fdff25924/js/src/dropdown.js#L159
[18:48:35] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:48:47] <robertmaxrees> you could ask in #jquery-dev i suppose.
[18:48:57] <robertmaxrees> see if somebody there remembers.
[18:49:40] <robertmaxrees> fnodeuser are you trying to solve a bug ooor....?
[18:50:14] <cvrebert> yeah, just didn't want to unnecessarily bother them. To #jquery-dev then.
[18:50:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, anybody with history would be in there.
[18:50:41] <fnodeuser> robertmaxrees: i want to run some tests
[18:50:49] <robertmaxrees> fnodeuser you want to profile things?
[18:51:24] <fnodeuser> i want to compare firefox and chrome
[18:51:39] <robertmaxrees> jsperf.com is one way to do that.
[18:51:58] <fnodeuser> no, after manual garbage collection
[18:52:40] <robertmaxrees> fnodeuser whyfor?  seems kind of silly to do a microbenchmark like that.
[18:53:04] <robertmaxrees> and i think it's --js-flags="--expose-gc"
[18:53:10] <fnodeuser> because there is no other way to do this
[18:53:17] <robertmaxrees> and then close all chrome windows
[18:53:41] <fnodeuser> that does nothing or it must combined with something else
[18:54:01] <fnodeuser> must be
[18:54:08] <robertmaxrees> according to http://stackoverflow.com/a/13951759, that works.
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> your version didn't have the quotes in it.
[18:55:03] <fnodeuser> maybe through the console it is ignored
[18:55:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm still confused about what you're testing, but OK.
[18:56:17] <fnodeuser> i want to push hard firefox and chrome to see how well they perform when this is done repeatedly
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> the folks in ##javascript might know.  or see if there's a chrome/chromium channel.
[18:59:03] <fnodeuser> they developers are idlers there, almost everyone in there is a google employee
[18:59:21] <fnodeuser> the
[18:59:56] <robertmaxrees> then try ##javascript?
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> just trying to help you get help :)
[19:00:12] <fnodeuser> that requires registration
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:00:20] <fnodeuser> :P
[19:01:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd go ahead and register, but meh.
[19:02:09] <fnodeuser> they are afraid of unregistered users
[19:02:20] <robertmaxrees> it helps prevent spam.
[19:03:03] <fnodeuser> there is flood kick and they can ban those that want to create problems
[19:03:21] <robertmaxrees> i dunno why you're being combative about it, but OK.
[19:04:15] <fnodeuser> registering to ask one question only?
[19:04:21] <robertmaxrees> maybe you'll be back.
[19:04:27] <robertmaxrees> takes a few seconds.
[19:04:28] <robertmaxrees> iono.
[19:05:01] <fnodeuser> ok, fuck it, i'll see if i can register
[19:07:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:07:42] <throwaway9999999> :P
[19:08:17] <robertmaxrees> alright mang.  good luck.
[19:09:18] <throwaway9999999> they must have gone through all the throw away services
[19:09:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't see why you're so opposed to making an accounbt.
[19:10:15] <saganbyte> hello there
[19:10:40] <saganbyte> I m using $.getScript to fetch a JS snippet from a URL and inject it in the DOM
[19:10:53] <saganbyte> Is there some way I can do something to it before jQuery auto injects it?
[19:10:54] <throwaway9999999> robertmaxrees: because they are retards
[19:10:58] <robertmaxrees> woah hey.
[19:11:01] <robertmaxrees> not an OK word.
[19:11:08] <throwaway9999999> finally
[19:11:32] <robertmaxrees> saganbyte put your code before the getScript call?
[19:12:00] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: I want to wrap a try/catch around the response before jQuery injects it
[19:12:28] <robertmaxrees> then getScript isn't what you want.
[19:12:42] <throwaway9999999> throwaway9999999: i'm referring to stupid people, not those with mental disabilities, people who have no mental disabilities but behave like they do
[19:13:09] <saganbyte> Ah i see, that s thought as well, hence thought of confirming before going ahead with $.ajax or $.get
[19:13:42] <robertmaxrees> throwaway9999999 doesn't really matter. that word, like some others, is pretty offensive.
[19:13:58] <throwaway9999999> political correction is bad
[19:14:09] <robertmaxrees> being non-exclusionary is good.
[19:14:20] <saganbyte> (unless you can recommend something other than $.get or $.ajax)
[19:14:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to hang out in this channel if you don't like it.
[19:14:36] <robertmaxrees> saganbyte why are you loading a script like that in the first place?
[19:15:03] <throwaway9999999> robertmaxrees: are you telling me that we should tolerate people who choose to be stupid at our expense?
[19:15:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that we should do our best to not exclude people.
[19:15:38] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to argue it, feel free to PM me about it.  Otherwise, let's move on.  Thanks!
[19:16:49] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: believe it or not, its a mechanism to check if a browser is running the code
[19:17:01] <robertmaxrees> saganbyte huh?
[19:17:14] <saganbyte> this leaves out things like PhantomJS and any other binary that can include a JS engine
[19:17:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - what does that have to do with phantom?
[19:17:36] <saganbyte> it s for the rudimentary tools commonly available in the market for compromising a website
[19:17:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:18:03] <saganbyte> robertmaxrees: I m not really sure if you'd want to go into the entire 'why' of it
[19:18:16] <saganbyte> it s pretty lengthy and i can assur you it s a legit reason
[19:19:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:19:45] <robertmaxrees> sure i do.
[19:19:54] <robertmaxrees> because i might be able to give you a better idea on how to approach it :)
[19:20:04] <saganbyte> I d sure like that!
[19:20:10] <saganbyte> Ok here goes then,
[19:20:39] <saganbyte> There are a bunch of things one does to prevent websites from being hacked, one of em is CSRF
[19:20:45] <saganbyte> and there could be some more
[19:21:08] <saganbyte> All of these are already implemented and yet every one of them can be bypassed in some way or the other
[19:22:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:22:05] <saganbyte> most of the methods i m refering are commonly conducted via scripts available in the market for this
[19:22:12] <robertmaxrees> so i'm going to back you way up.
[19:22:24] <saganbyte> eh
[19:22:38] <robertmaxrees> i work for a major ecommerce company - you're confused about the techniques and mechanisms we use to prevent those things.
[19:22:40] <robertmaxrees> but go on.
[19:22:45] <saganbyte> sure
[19:23:00] <saganbyte> so lets just focus on those mechanisms that use commercially available tools
[19:23:14] <saganbyte> these tools do not have a JS engine in them (just a matter of time)
[19:23:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:23:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:23:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:23:27] <saganbyte> bear with me
[19:23:31] <saganbyte> i know it sounds all funny
[19:24:02] <saganbyte> so the segment that i m workign on only considers those tools (that do not have a JS engine attached)
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> when you say "tool", can you give an example?
[19:24:26] <saganbyte> hence one of the ways to check if it s not that tool, is to see if it runs JS
[19:26:43] <saganbyte> if i run a random set of JS on the server and then send that random set (in th unique order) to the browser, then i can expect the browser to come up with the same outcome
[19:26:57] <saganbyte> which i can put in a cookie from the clientside (another JS specific task)
[19:27:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to determine if the client runs JS?
[19:27:26] <saganbyte> i can then verify this back on the server side before proceeding
[19:27:35] <saganbyte> obviosly there are other checks in place and this is just one of them
[19:28:47] <robertmaxrees> this seems really silly.
[19:29:17] <saganbyte> yes i agree and i m waitign for some way that you can suggest where i can confirm that the requesting script is indeed coming from a browser
[19:29:18] <robertmaxrees> but you should ship the script from the server with the try/catch on it if thats really what you want.
[19:29:29] <saganbyte> yes that s obvios
[19:29:33] <saganbyte> but i dont have control of that app
[19:30:14] <saganbyte> you asked what tools: it s the attacker tools in the black market - i do not have the names as such at the moment
[19:30:31] <robertmaxrees> you realize that phantomjs can run js, right?
[19:30:46] <saganbyte> yes and i already mentioned i m targetting tools that cannot run JS
[19:31:02] <saganbyte> if you can think of somethign that can recognize phantom vs browser that d be fantastic
[19:31:10] <saganbyte> but i dont expect that so easily
[19:31:34] <saganbyte> why phantom, i could use selenium and bypass all my checks)
[19:31:50] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:31:52] <robertmaxrees> there are tons of tools.
[19:31:59] <saganbyte> exactly
[19:32:03] <robertmaxrees> I guess it feels like a lot of wasted effort.
[19:32:18] <saganbyte> and that s certainly my goal till the 'commercially' available tools level up to using JS engines
[19:32:21] <robertmaxrees> there are also 3rd party services that do this sort of thing already.
[19:32:28] <saganbyte> how do they do t
[19:32:31] <saganbyte> how do they do tit*
[19:32:35] <saganbyte> haha *it
[19:33:00] <saganbyte> i m more interested in how they do it than recommend to my higher ups 'Hey, lets use a third party tool'
[19:33:06] <robertmaxrees> probably a combination of testing the source of the traffic, user agebt validation, etc.
[19:33:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd flip that conversation btw.
[19:33:44] <saganbyte> user agent validation? seriously?
[19:33:51] <robertmaxrees> that's one of a few things they might use.
[19:34:00] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way - you have a car mechanic and a watchmaker.
[19:34:07] <robertmaxrees> who would you trust to rebuild a transmission?
[19:34:19] <saganbyte> the JavaScript engineer on IRC of course
[19:34:26] <saganbyte> :D sorry couldnt resist it
[19:34:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:35:01] <saganbyte> i suppose you are going toward the third party solution again
[19:35:25] <robertmaxrees> so now who would you trust with this kind of detection?  a company that specializes in it?  or somebody just learning about it and trying to devise a solution?
[19:35:54] <saganbyte> yes i get that but does it hurt to find out 'how' it can be done?
[19:36:15] <robertmaxrees> Why not ask a company that does it?
[19:36:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:36:18] <saganbyte> user agent, referers, browser capabilities.. all of this can be spooded
[19:36:25] <saganbyte> spoofed*
[19:36:35] <robertmaxrees> IP addresses, amount of traffic coming fom a particular ip range, etc.
[19:36:46] <robertmaxrees> they can do more comprehensive analysis than you likely can.
[19:36:56] <saganbyte> agreed
[19:38:45] <robertmaxrees> you could probably talk to one of their sales guys and ask them about those details.
[19:38:53] <saganbyte> haha yea
[19:39:14] <robertmaxrees> they won't give you the whole story, and they may protect some stuff, but it'll give you an idea.
[19:39:32] <saganbyte> true
[19:39:56] <saganbyte> at this point i m just cringing at the fact that $.getScript wont let me wrap a try catch before injecting it in the dom
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:40:57] <robertmaxrees> that's what it does.
[19:42:56] <saganbyte> no real reason as such, it s just that i m not so happy i m gonna have to explicitly do somethign like $('body').append('<script>' + response_I_got + '</script'>
[19:43:13] <robertmaxrees> why not just include a script tag in th efirst place?
[19:43:28] <saganbyte> and then inject it inside there?
[19:43:56] <saganbyte> append*
[19:44:18] <robertmaxrees> why are you ajaxing it at all?
[19:44:26] <robertmaxrees> include it as the source on the page.
[19:44:29] <saganbyte> it needs to be async
[19:44:39] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:44:47] <robertmaxrees> this could stop the entire page from working.
[19:44:48] <robertmaxrees> sooo....
[19:44:49] <saganbyte> i need metrics around it
[19:44:59] <saganbyte> i need to capture load time
[19:45:03] <robertmaxrees> hell, even omniture's tracking isn't technically async.
[19:45:05] <saganbyte> and log failure if any
[19:45:09] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> now you're looking for analytics as well.
[19:45:21] <saganbyte> haha
[19:45:36] <saganbyte> well, that s how this started for me
[19:45:54] <robertmaxrees> don't mix the two ;)
[19:49:11] <saganbyte> unfortunately i cannot do avoid that
[19:49:24] <saganbyte> nevertheless thanks for your time (& insights) :)
[19:49:56] <saganbyte> i m gonna go ahead and use $.ajax and do some tracking in the error and success scenarios
