[02:11:12] <Cork> d3m0n: what do you mean parameterizing?
[02:12:25] <Cork> d3m0n: also be warned your code is is xss exploitable if your source data isn't sanitized
[02:41:13] <d3m0n> Cork, as in I can pass a string parameter to determine what key to use on an object
[02:43:24] <Cork> d3m0n: is it a nested object?
[02:43:39] <Cork> or just a straight key value object
[02:44:06] <d3m0n> Cork yeah it is and only of the nested objects needs to key value changed
[02:44:33] <Cork> d3m0n: then you need to recurs through the nested objects
[02:44:41] <d3m0n> Example: value.images.fixed_width_downsampled.url, I am looking to pass a parameter to change value.images."var-here".url
[02:44:57] <Cork> if($.isPlainObject(value)) { recurs through the nested object }
[02:45:17] <Cork> d3m0n: then you can just do value.images[var].url
[02:45:48] <d3m0n> That would be perfect, I tried literal but guess I wrote it incorrect
[02:46:53] <d3m0n> As for the XSS, anything that's submitted get htmlentities automatically. Is that sufficient enough for this call
[02:46:55] <d3m0n> ?*
[02:49:25] <Cork> d3m0n: i would rewrite the code so it just isn't subject to the problem
[02:51:43] <Cork> d3m0n: only did one, but line 14 https://jsfiddle.net/f87684tu/
[02:52:02] <Cork> d3m0n: line 13 is xss susceptible, line 14 does the exact same thing, but isn't
[02:52:32] <Cork> (the first one parses external data as html, the later creates a dom element and sets properties on it)
[02:52:56] <Cork> so it is a rather small change but it makes a big change for security
[02:54:22] <d3m0n> That's great, thank you Cork

[04:28:09] <ChiLL_SurF> hi there. i am trying to make my first chrome extension and i am facing difficulties in running this simple 2 lines of code
[04:28:49] <ChiLL_SurF> these are the only contents of content.js
[04:29:09] <ChiLL_SurF> http://dpaste.com/2ABCKWK
[04:29:40] <ChiLL_SurF> and chrome says line 4 is undefined
[04:29:47] <ChiLL_SurF> any help?
[05:04:46] <Cork> ChiLL_SurF: that is kinda off topic for this channel as this is about jquery not chrome extensions
[05:05:30] <ChiLL_SurF> i just referred chrome.
[05:05:39] <ChiLL_SurF> the jquery code is somehow not correct
[05:05:46] <Cork> ya, but like i said it is offtopic for this channel
[05:05:50] <ChiLL_SurF> as i am not declaring firstHref correctly
[05:06:03] <Cork> no it isn't that it isn't correct, it isn't in scope
[05:06:04] <ChiLL_SurF> i didn;t know that...sorry
[05:06:11] <ChiLL_SurF> can you please point me out where i can ask?
[05:06:35] <Cork> i don't think there is a chrome extension irc channel, at least i can't find one
[05:06:40] <Cork> you could try the google groups
[05:07:34] <Cork> ChiLL_SurF: https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/5eag7g/extension_development_support/
[05:07:36] <MacroMan> What function can I use to narrow a collection of elements on class name?
[05:07:44] <MacroMan> My mind has gone blank
[05:07:53] <Cork> MacroMan: .filter
[05:07:57] <MacroMan> Thanks
[05:08:12] <Cork> MacroMan: http://api.jquery.com/?s=filter
[05:08:15] <Cork> opps
[05:08:24] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[05:08:43] <Cork> MacroMan: it takes the same kind of selectors $() and .find does
[05:09:31] <MacroMan> Cork: Got it, thanks
[05:37:56] <pmehta> Hello! Is it possible to achieve http://jsfiddle.net/krustev/NfMDV/ using javascript/ jquery and can we add another multi select before supplier?
[05:58:17] <Skyadav_> Hey guys..
[05:58:49] <Skyadav_> Need one help on jquery
[05:59:35] <Skyadav_> Is anybody here??
[06:04:08] <d3m0n> New to IRC? Ask n wait
[06:27:26] <Ghostwalk[m]> he left? ask your question Sky if you are still here
[06:28:54] <Cork> heh two in a row too
[06:29:23] <Cork> but ya, webclients, classic
[06:29:35] <Ghostwalk[m]> happens a lot, yh
[06:29:41] <Cork> ya
[06:30:00] <Cork> think irc is instant just cause you load it in a browser
[06:49:42] <sine0> hey anyone around I need some jquery help ?
[06:50:08] <sine0> ok i couldnt resist
[07:09:06] <kim366> Test
[08:22:06] <jak2000> hi all how to substract :  8 hours - 03:20 hours?
[08:23:04] <Uhkis> jak2000: momentjs is your friend
[08:25:25] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[08:33:00] <jak2000> other question:
[08:37:57] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/Lc2sxe6w/1/   <--- the users choose start time of any Task, then in input text type: the number of hours and minutes worked, in this case..... how to calc the end Time?
[08:41:21] <toothfai_> Trying to output checked checkboxes ... https://jsfiddle.net/0vs7z2sp/13/  Any clue? No alert ...
[08:50:15] <Cork> toothfai_: how do you expect an if case would catch clicks?
[08:50:53] <Cork> toothfai_: https://jsfiddle.net/0vs7z2sp/14/
[08:51:31] <Cork> jak2000: there isn't a clean way in plain js, you most likely want a lib like momentjs
[08:51:31] <toothfai_> Cork: tnx a lot!
[08:54:57] <poboy> This is working as intended but I'm trying to figure how to only have to add <li>  in javascript and keep the rest in html.  https://jsfiddle.net/q08d3nmz/
[08:55:30] <poboy> it would probably entail using .find('li') or something?
[08:55:52] <Cork> poboy: i would recommend moving it all into a template
[08:56:12] <poboy> I'm not quite sure how to do that
[08:56:33] <poboy> like a seperate file with the html part?
[08:56:34] <skinux> jQueyr has a virtual DOM??
[08:56:47] <jak2000> Cork thanks
[08:58:16] <kim366> http://jsfiddle.net/2EECN/365/ seems like a horrible way of doing what I want. a) the image isn't stuck at the top, if I do it with my own code, it instead flickers around and b) on mobile it updates every second, which makes it very not smooth. For some reason it works perfectly in jsfiddle, though
[08:59:44] <Cork> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/q08d3nmz/1/
[09:00:37] <Cork> the fiddle doesn't really work to show an example where the click handler works
[09:00:46] <Cork> so not sure what that is suppose to do
[09:02:00] <poboy> The shield icon toggles a sidebar on click
[09:02:34] <poboy> It's strange cuz the boss wants me to do this in javascript instead of html/php.  Not sure why
[09:02:51] <Cork> ah
[09:03:02] <Cork> quicker response
[09:03:17] <Cork> well just make it into two templates
[09:03:25] <poboy> We will be building out a sidebar for admin only.  That's just the first example
[09:03:31] <Cork> one with the header and ul, and one with the li's
[09:04:00] <poboy> thanks, Cork
[09:06:44] <skinux> Do I need a virtual dom to update database data with form data via API in real-time?
[09:16:40] <kim366> Cork: Scroll up and down in the output window
[09:17:27] <Cork> skinux: you need to figure out how to handle database security server side
[09:17:39] <Cork> it has little to do with jquery
[09:19:27] <skinux> I'm not talking about security. I'm talkiing about getting/setting data between forms and database
[09:19:46] <skinux> All rows will have the same data fields, but not the same data.
[09:20:18] <skinux> I think I read that multiple fields which are named the same will become an array on server-side, is this true?
[09:21:40] <fn> Cork: need your advice
[09:21:43] <fn> input = 25, array = [0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100];
[09:21:50] <Cork> skinux:ya, and that is something jquery can't do; at all
[09:21:54] <fn> how can i get the 2 nearest array values on input?
[09:22:01] <fn> input 25 -> nearest values are 20 and 30...
[09:22:05] <kim366> Why not? Isn't that what ajax is for?
[09:22:18] <Cork> skinux: to get the data from the form to the database you have to have a solution to submit the data, and validate that it is actually ok for the source to change it
[09:22:20] <skinux> jQuery can't do it or can't handle it?
[09:22:34] <Cork> skinux: jquery should not have access to your database
[09:22:39] <Cork> at all
[09:22:46] <kim366> No, but ajax can send calls to the backend
[09:22:49] <skinux> Here's the deal, I'm trying to write a web-based job application tracking app.
[09:23:11] <Cork> kim366: sending data sure, but not modifying it
[09:23:26] <Cork> that is what the server should be responsible of, hence my first comment
[09:23:54] <skinux> SO, each will row have all the same fields, but no two rows will have the same data. However, I'd like to make it so the database is updated upon change of even row field.
[09:25:27] <Cork> skinux: so, just have fields in the page and on modification change the changed value to the server
[09:25:36] <Cork> then the server should just take it from there
[09:26:44] <localh0st> fn: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/16304/
[09:27:22] <Cork> yup (sorry didn't have time to look at the question until now)
[09:27:29] <fn> thanks localh0st
[09:27:59] <fn> is array.length and for loop faster than jquery $each?
[09:28:16] <Cork> ah
[09:28:26] <Cork> localh0st, fn: don't do array loops like that
[09:28:45] <Cork> localh0st, fn: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/16305/
[09:29:06] <Cork> cache the length before you start looping or you will have the browser itterate over the entire array for each loop
[09:29:12] <fn> ahh
[09:29:14] <fn> i see
[09:29:28] <Cork> fn: and for pure arrays for is a tiny bit faster
[09:30:13] <skinux> Also, to have individual fields update on change, do I need to write an event handler line for each element name or can I attach for all elements?
[09:30:38] <Cork> skinux: no you want to use event delegation
[09:31:14] <Cork> skinux: but note you will have to handle how to reorder changes when they come out of order (separate ajax requests can come out of order cause of how the net works)
[09:32:33] <skinux> Well, coming FROM the server, all data would be read at once and the entire form would be re-rendered.
[09:32:42] <Cork> uh
[09:33:01] <skinux> There is no reason to load only one row from the database.
[09:33:04] <Cork> skinux: you know there isn't an "at once" when you have a network inbetween?
[09:33:22] <fn> Cork: thanks for advice, also localh0st, need only to combine the array with other values now. thanks a lot.
[09:33:29] <Cork> or are you talking about running this as a javascript app on the local machine or something?
[09:33:41] <skinux> I mean reading from server, all data would be requested at once.
[09:34:02] <Cork> so for each change you would reread the entire database?
[09:34:09] <Cork> what if two users changes it at the same time?
[09:34:42] <skinux> Oh, the save request to the server would include data specifying user
[09:35:05] <Cork> and what if the changed data includes the same field?
[09:35:09] <skinux> Probably with an API key made up of part of the user id
[09:35:25] <Cork> heck what if the same users has two tabs open
[09:35:50] <skinux> Umm, I don't know why they would. But other way, it wouldn't matter.
[09:35:55] <Cork> (what i'm trying to get you to realize is that you're missing the entire concurency problem here...)
[09:36:19] <Cork> the data flow isn't syncronous, it is async
[09:36:40] <skinux> You're trying to say I need to track possible multiple requests from the same user at hte same time.
[09:37:06] <Cork> 1. you can't just change database data from js, if you do you will have a security nightmare
[09:37:18] <skinux> Or I could just make it so that no one user could have two sessions at the same time.
[09:37:30] <Cork> 2. you will have to figure out what data you can let ppl change at the same time without them stepping on eachother
[09:37:48] <Cork> 3. you need to figure out how to get the updated data out to the other users when a user changes it
[09:38:07] <Cork> 4. and how to handle if multiple users change the same thing (if you allow it)
[09:38:08] <skinux> If I use API keys to track user request comes from, why would I need to worry about that?
[09:38:26] <skinux> Are you assuming all users will be working with the same data set?
[09:38:33] <Cork> you mean each api key would have its own set of data, no shared state at all?
[09:38:59] <skinux> As in, data stored, would be stored per-user, no two users would have the same "log" of data.
[09:39:19] <Cork> and no other user could see or modify there data?
[09:39:33] <skinux> Well, not unless they hacked.
[09:39:54] <skinux> Each entry would be associated with a specific user.
[09:40:19] <skinux> Users can only view data they submitted as far as intended use of the app.
[09:40:29] <Cork> hard to see how you could have a job application where noone could read the applications...
[09:40:37] <Cork> but ok, then ya that could work
[09:40:48] <skinux> This isn't for employers. This is for job seekers to keep track of applications they've submitted.
[09:41:46] <Uhkis> isn't it already very well implemented as "sent emails" ? :D
[09:42:14] <skinux> emails don't remind you to make a follow-up call, or send a thank-you note after an interview.
[09:42:30] <skinux> THey don't remind you how you found the opening either
[09:43:46] <Uhkis> :)
[09:45:07] <localh0st> Cork: thanks, I didnt know that
[10:53:05] <V7> Hey all
[10:53:21] <V7> Is it possible to $( element ).find( "tr.selected" ) ?
[10:54:35] <localh0st> V7: yes?
[10:55:35] <MassDebates> $( "p" ).find( "span" ).css( "color", "red" );
[10:57:35] <V7> So it strange, but I can't get these elements
[10:58:01] <localh0st> V7: fiddle
[10:58:11] <Cork> V7: 1. the tr isn't a child of element, 2. element doesn't exist or 3. it doesn't have the class
[10:58:17] <V7> Oh fixed
[10:58:44] <MikeD_> fwiw, i suggest setting a class on the span rather than changing the color directly...  graphic designers like to argue about "red" and want to mess with color codes all day... so put it in a class and keep them confined to the .css file(s)  :)
[10:58:52] <V7> I guess it was 1
[10:59:43] <V7> Could you tell me the horizon between #javascript and #jquery ?
[10:59:57] <Cork> horizon?
[11:00:04] <V7> edge *
[11:00:20] <V7> verge
[11:00:22] <Cork> you mean where jquery stops and javascript start or?
[11:00:32] <V7> Yes ... to ask for
[11:00:51] <MikeD_> that's a good question
[11:00:55] <Cork> if it doesn't involve the web you should take it to javascript
[11:01:04] <Cork> (ex. mongodb js)
[11:01:09] <MikeD_> or node
[11:01:13] <Cork> ya
[11:01:19] <Cork> though i know some ppl use jquery there...
[11:01:33] <Cork> basically if you don't have a dom, it is #javascript
[11:01:49] <MassDebates> ##javascript ftfy
[11:01:49] <MassDebates> :)
[11:01:59] <Cork> else you can ask here or there ppl will point you to the other channel if they find it belongs there
[11:02:10] <V7> I've asked because someone sent me here from #javascript
[11:02:17] <Cork> but as jquery is a javascript framework not a language the lines are bound to be blury
[11:02:24] <V7> So ... I'll ask there and here :D
[11:02:29] * V7 kiddin
[11:02:38] <Cork> just make sure you don't ask in both at the same time
[11:02:40] <MassDebates> V7:  I would ask simple questions here, first.
[11:02:48] <MassDebates> V7:  if it's complicaed, it's a bit of a toss-up ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:02:49] <V7> Roger
[11:02:57] <MikeD_> usually ##javascript will refer to #jquery when you invoke anything with $
[11:03:11] <V7> With dollars ?
[11:03:15] * V7 kiddin
[11:03:16] <Cork> and we refer to prototype if it has $$ :D
[11:03:41] <MassDebates> Nobody cares about prototype without $$
[11:03:44] <MikeD_> honestly, i don't understand the hate... but w/e
[11:03:47] <Cork> (not that anyone uses prototype anymore)
[11:03:54] <MassDebates> Same. We're actually talking about the level of hate in ##javascript right now
[11:03:57] <MikeD_> you'd be surprised
[11:04:06] <MassDebates> Again, prototype is also being raised in there.
[11:04:06] <Cork> MikeD_: hate?
[11:04:11] <MassDebates> Some jungian stuff going on
[11:04:15] <V7> Protoptye fasted isn't it ?
[11:04:19] <V7> faster *
[11:04:21] <Cork> no
[11:04:30] <Cork> it is much more unstable though
[11:04:35] <V7> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:05:14] <Cork> to me it is more that "prototype is a bunch of methods thrown together as need was found"
[11:05:23] <Cork> while jquery feels designed
[11:05:48] <Cork> was a while since i last used prototype though
[11:05:52] <MikeD_> oh wait, prototype vs Prototype - that was some genius naming
[11:06:10] <Cork> MikeD_: lol ya i don't mean javascript protoype objects
[11:06:20] <V7> I ment
[11:06:32] <Cork> i like that little guy ^^
[11:06:54] <V7> Like Array.prototype.forEach
[11:07:06] <Cork> ya, that is javascript prototype
[11:07:15] <MikeD_> i want to make a language called "Code" so i say i code Code but don't code in Code
[11:07:18] <V7> :)
[11:07:25] <Cork> :D
[11:07:57] <Cork> prototype is fun cause it has $('id') and $$('selectors')
[11:07:59] <Cork> just lovery
[11:08:04] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29
[11:08:10] <Cork> and if something isn't found you get a null object so things crash
[11:08:19] <Cork> yay for error checks on every line of the code
[11:08:25] <V7> o.o
[11:08:34] <V7> The return would be:
[11:09:35] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE is funny too
[11:12:47] <V7> Look at this one http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/erat2_big.png
[11:13:17] <grapheti> http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/ :D
[11:13:55] <V7> http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html
[11:36:11] <jak2000> taplar worked with moment?
[11:36:27] <taplar> not really
[11:37:14] <MikeD_> it took me a while to recall this example of esoteric language: https://esolangs.org/wiki/MarioLANG
[11:39:27] <MikeD_> it's silliness, but the idea of visual programming is interesting
[11:39:44] <taplar> kinda qr cody
[11:40:25] <grapheti> that looks similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
[11:44:38] <MassDebates> I want to see someone use BF to make something thats practical
[11:44:41] <MassDebates> on the web.
[11:46:06] <toothfai_> a good way to insert <p> tags around each item of an array? https://dpaste.de/kMbL
[11:47:16] <taplar> add that to your map
[11:48:11] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I have an element and want to replace its content with some ajax retrieved data. Unfortunately, .html() does nothing. anybody got a hint? the ajax content contains some JS...
[11:49:13] <taplar> Hackwar1: can you show us what you are trying to do?
[11:49:22] <Hackwar1> one sec
[11:50:07] <Hackwar1> https://pastebin.com/45ZdHTRg
[11:50:51] <Hackwar1> everything looks right until and including line 17. But line 18 does nothing.
[11:51:22] <taplar> what does line 17 print?
[11:51:45] <Hackwar1> it returns a jQuery object with the right element in the selection.
[11:52:05] <Hackwar1> Object { 0: <div.module.mod-box.cartbox.deepest>, selector: "", length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument
[11:52:08] <Hackwar1> to be precise
[11:52:38] <taplar> ok, so html() should work on that guy
[11:52:45] <Hackwar1> yep
[11:53:49] <Hackwar1> I'm wondering if html() crashes on the <script> tags included in the content var
[11:54:03] <taplar> nah
[11:54:16] <taplar> html() is essentially just a wrapper to the setting of innerHTML
[11:55:30] <Hackwar1> is the second var of each something special? Maybe a special object instead of just a string?
[11:55:45] <taplar> you could try to use the property directly and see if anything changes
[11:55:57] <taplar> $('#dcart-block-' + key).parent()[0].innerHTML = content;
[11:56:08] <Hackwar1> ok, will try that
[11:56:36] <MikeD_> fwiw if content doesn't have the id on it, that may only work once
[11:57:14] <MikeD_> ...or if all the 'key' elements are inside the same parent, etc.
[11:58:00] <taplar> key on the each is the index
[11:58:25] <taplar> and html() replaces the innerHTML, it doesn't remove the parent
[11:58:32] <taplar> remove/alter
[11:58:48] <grapheti> MassDebates, http://www.jsfuck.com/ - there's an alert for ya
[11:58:48] <Hackwar1> doesn't work...
[11:58:54] <MikeD_> yeah, i was only looking at that line... not the actual existing markup
[11:59:03] <taplar> Hackwar1: look at your console for errors
[11:59:06] <MassDebates> hm?
[11:59:10] <MassDebates> grapheti:  Sup

[11:59:19] <MassDebates> Oh, yeah
[11:59:25] <MassDebates> Already shared BF and was shown JF
[11:59:28] <MassDebates> interesting
[12:00:33] <Hackwar1> taplar: no errors in the console.
[12:00:38] <Hackwar1> I'm really stumped...
[12:00:59] <taplar> dunno then
[12:03:07] <MikeD_> Hackwar1: did you make a fiddle?
[12:03:50] <jak2000> i need get diference of time for get a total hours and minutes sample: xhour1='00' xmin1='00' xhour2='03' xmin2='30'  the hourtotaltime='03:30'  how to?
[12:03:55] <jak2000> moment is the way?
[12:04:39] <MikeD_> jak2000: looks like a math problem to me
[12:06:22] <grapheti> MassDebates, like that sexy alert?
[12:10:05] <Hackwar1> MikeD_: no
[12:10:12] <Hackwar1> but I figured it out
[12:10:26] <Hackwar1> I used an ID as a selector
[12:11:03] <MikeD_> that # vs . is an easy thing to screw up
[12:11:18] <Hackwar1> and somehow it seems when you do jQuery(#id).parent().html(something), the original selector gets overwritten and removed and it somehow crashes at that.
[12:11:34] <Hackwar1> no, the id was the right selector, it returned the right thing
[12:11:46] <Hackwar1> but somehow it failed when using an id
[12:11:50] <Hackwar1> using a class however worked
[12:11:58] <Hackwar1> anyway.
[12:12:14] <MikeD_> neat
[12:12:17] <Hackwar1> solved and moving on to the next task: Feeding the baby and bringing it to bed. :-)
[12:12:27] <Hackwar1> hope that helps someone else sometime
[12:12:36] <MikeD_> "feeding the baby" seems like a euphemism for your boss
[12:12:55] <MikeD_> i mean, maybe that's just because my boss is a baby
[12:13:08] <grapheti> :D
[12:13:15] <MikeD_> i know, this channel is logged... but whatever, i'll call him a baby to his face, idc.
[12:13:41] <taplar> he can't understand you anyway
[12:13:44] <taplar> he's a baby
[12:13:53] <MikeD_> SNL skit?
[12:14:06] <taplar> wtf did you just call me?
[12:22:04] <MassDebates> you can call taplar anything - just don't call him late for lunch!
[12:22:21] <taplar_lunch> dang skippy
[12:22:37] <taplar_lunch> 11:10 i'm skipping to the bistro

[12:49:42] <tarwater> has anyone here used jquery mobile with google analytics?
[12:51:22] <robertmaxrees> tarwater i'm sure plenty of people have.
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> tarwater are you having an issue?
[12:51:42] <tarwater> im just wondering if i have to go about it in a different way
[12:51:51] <tarwater> because jquery mobile only loads the <head> once
[12:52:03] <tarwater> but thats where i include the analytics stuff. im scared its not going to work correctly
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20872243/jquery-mobile-google-universal-analytics
[12:52:23] <tarwater> i see fixes for this on google but they're all quite old
[12:52:31] <robertmaxrees> specifically https://stackoverflow.com/a/21898419/923919
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> the important part is that you need to add a handler for pageshow and then manually call the ga function and pass im the pageview info manually.
[12:53:30] <tarwater> i feel like that is deprecated maybe?
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> this seems to corroborate with that suggestion.
[12:54:26] <robertmaxrees> assuming you're using jqm's spa facilitie.
[12:54:29] <robertmaxrees> *facilities
[12:54:48] <taplar_lunch> feelsilititties
[12:55:03] * taplar_lunch wanders off
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:56:00] <taplar_lunch> i'm pretty sure we do some ga calls on our spa
[12:56:20] <taplar_lunch> ya
[12:57:19] <tarwater> so do i do what the stackoverflow answer says
[12:57:31] <tarwater> or do i just call that function that google shows
[12:57:33] <toothfai_> a good way to insert <p> tags around each item of an array? https://dpaste.de/kMbL
[12:57:54] <taplar_lunch> toothfai_: i already suggested adding that to your map
[12:58:18] <toothfai_> taplar_lunch: oops, missed it, will check log, tnx
[12:58:34] <tarwater> every day i come to work to do something straightforward and jquery mobile makes it 10x more complicated. i despise it so much :(
[13:00:36] <taplar_lunch> an example like that we have is like: <a href="/Careers/store-roles" onclick="ga('send', {'hitType': 'event', 'eventCategory': 'careersLink', 'eventAction': 'clickedOnCareers', 'eventLabel': 'linkForCareers' })">
[13:02:56] <tarwater> on every link??
[13:03:08] <taplar> right now it's just on two i believe
[13:03:44] <taplar> yeah, but those two are the entry points into the application
[13:03:53] <taplar> which i may revisit putting more on other things
[13:07:56] <taplar> i would think pretty much any link that performs a logical transition in the spa would need one
[13:08:41] <taplar> *potentially
[13:27:37] <anli> Is there any editor to recommend instead of ckeditor?
[13:28:10] <anli> ckeditor seems to be buggy sometimes, for instance, I have to enter source mode to initially be able to enter text
[13:28:26] <robertmaxrees> that seems odd.
[13:28:29] <taplar> what are you using it for?
[13:28:54] <taplar> there are various wysiwyg plugins out there
[13:32:07] <taplar> we use https://www.tinymce.com/  though we tried at one point to switch to https://summernote.org/
[13:32:13] <anli> I have only used ckeditor
[13:32:43] <anli> ah, not free, it seems likeable however
[13:32:50] <taplar> both are free
[13:32:56] <anli> "Start a free trial"
[13:33:09] <grapheti> pell it up bb - https://github.com/jaredreich/pell
[13:33:21] <anli> ah, nice
[13:33:32] <anli> what is pell? :)
[13:33:36] <anli> you mean pull?
[13:33:51] <grapheti> pell is the new lingo for pull
[13:33:58] <anli> aha :)
[13:34:06] <anli> pell and pesh?
[13:34:11] <anli> lol
[13:34:20] <grapheti> in a pot
[13:34:25] <taplar> huh, i guess someone maintains that.  or we got in on tinymce before it went to the pay model
[13:35:04] <V7> Hey ;)
[13:35:10] <taplar> summernote works fine.  i think the issue we ran into was something around people copying and pasting from word documents
[13:35:12] <V7> It weird, but tr:last-child td:first-child doesn't work
[13:35:32] <taplar> V7: fiddle please
[13:36:15] <anli> wow, how simple that editor is, I so like it
[13:36:23] <anli> 6 buttons...
[13:37:44] <V7> Yeah, but here's an issue: https://i.imgur.com/sX5373r.png
[13:37:51] <V7> With summereditor
[13:37:55] <V7> note *
[13:38:09] <taplar> ?
[13:38:19] <anli> not pell then?
[13:39:15] <taplar> i'm not understanding what that picture is showing
[13:42:35] <V7> It shows that popup is floating away
[13:42:51] <taplar> ?
[13:43:05] <V7> Btw ... do you know how to set border-radius on table if td have background ?
[13:43:18] <taplar> that's a css question
[13:43:34] <taplar> you had a question earlier about :last-child and :first-child not working ... ?
[13:43:35] <V7> Ah right
[13:43:41] <V7> not working
[13:43:58] <taplar> and I asked if you had a fiddle showing your issue/question
[13:58:54] <aviran> Hey, I want to listen to dom changes and get a call back every time a <P> with a <div with class x> as parent is added.. is that possible?
[13:59:44] <taplar> you'll have to use an observable to do that, which isn't widely adopted in browsers
[14:01:16] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[14:03:39] <robertmaxrees> aviran what's adding that markup to the page?
[14:04:16] <aviran> the page itself, im working as a chrome extension above it
[14:06:36] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:06:45] <robertmaxrees> is there a user action or something you could bind to instead?
[14:47:27] <V7> Should it work if e is event from $("#table").on       $( e.target + " td" ).each( function( i, tr ) {    ?
[14:48:15] <V7> I'm asking because I'm getting Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLTableElement] td
[14:49:36] <pavonia> Try $(e.target).find("td") instead
[14:54:26] <V7> pavonia: $( e.target ).find("td").each( function( i, td ) {
[14:54:35] <V7> But error on if ( td.prop( 'disabled' ) ) {
[14:55:04] <V7> Is it possible to .each(function (index, element) ?
[14:55:13] <V7> With find ?
[14:55:42] <pavonia> What about $(td).prop?
[14:56:07] <V7> Oh
[14:56:10] <V7> Ofc ... my fault
[14:56:19] <V7> Just forgot about this one ...
[14:56:23] <V7> Thank you very much pavonia !
[14:57:01] <pavonia> No problem
[14:57:06] <V7> Really
[14:57:21] <Uhkis> that line makes no sense
[15:08:21] <anli> Why are there minified files on github? Are they not output files?
[15:09:04] <taplar> what?
[15:12:28] <hakkl[m]> Hi there. Is there a best practice to transmit the ajax response (non utf8) to my Javascript File. Thx
[15:15:30] <kanga> I have a pretty much fully functional datetimepicker functionality on my website, but with my step set as 15, every time chosen has to be X:10 for some reason
[15:15:37] <kanga> i can change the hour, but teh minute is always :10
[15:15:50] <kanga> why is this?
[15:20:25] <anli> pell cannot use a textarea?
[15:24:12] <anli> seems to only support divs...
[15:26:52] <tripflex> regarding `$(document).ready` and `$(window).load` ... i'm building out a plugin that needs to loop through all fields on a page, and my worry is that if i trigger the function to call in `$(window).load` and say the client's site has issues loading external images, css, etc ... that it may not get ran (if something times out), anybody got any thoughts on that?
[15:27:09] <robertmaxrees> tripflex why do you need to wait for the load event at all?
[15:27:13] <robertmaxrees> why not doc ready?
[15:27:16] <tripflex> Reason i'm looking at `$(window).load` is allow things like select2 or chosenjs to init before looping through all the fields
[15:27:21] <kanga> My datetimepicker works correctly except that any time I choose will end up as X:10, where X is the correct hour I chose but regardless of the minutes selected it will be set to 10 once picked. In my javascript code, I have the step set as 15.
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> kanga we if we can't see the problem, how can we help
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:27:45] <robertmaxrees> tripflex just load your code after those plugins fire?
[15:27:51] <kanga> Well I figured I'd summarize it first in case it happened to be a common problem. Will send code now, sorry!
[15:27:57] <tripflex> because i'm not going to know exactly what kind of other libs clients are going to be using on their forms, like select2 or what not, so just trying to make sure it executes after everything is loaded
[15:28:14] <robertmaxrees> tripflex not unreasonable to tell people that they need to init your code after those other plugins.
[15:28:21] <tripflex> yeah the problem is i don't know what plugins they may be using ... i mean i guess i could look up something that triggers for the most popular ones
[15:28:24] <robertmaxrees> can't account for every edge case.,
[15:28:31] <tripflex> yeah i know ... story of my life right ahaha
[15:28:32] <tripflex> :P
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> so the onus is laid on the shoulder of the user.
[15:29:09] <tripflex> but am i correct in assuming that my code in window load may not fire if external css or other resources end of having errors or timing out ?
[15:29:13] <tripflex> or at least take a very long time to load
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> it'll wait until they time out iirc.
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> which can take a long time.
[15:29:36] <tripflex> ok yeah that was my worry :P
[15:29:36] <robertmaxrees> and isn't really reliable for what you're looking to do.
[15:30:13] <tripflex> yup you're right, just trying to be as accommodating as possible, but sounds like window load may cause more issues than it solves
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:30:34] <tripflex> so best to just use ready and if they have issues, can deal with that on a case by case scenario
[15:30:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:30:42] <tripflex> thanks for the input :)
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:30:59] <tripflex> ahaha i meant like ... telling my clients to fix their site, not my plugin :P
[15:31:07] <robertmaxrees> make sure you expose an init method that people manually call and then note in your docs that they need to call it after the other stuff inits.
[15:31:20] <robertmaxrees> no need to autoinit on your own.
[15:31:25] <kanga> https://pastebin.com/LLhFpCeH here is my code. The steps shown when I click the textbox are correct, all 15 min intervals. but regardless of the one chosen it ends in :10 minutes always :/
[15:32:04] <robertmaxrees> kanga which datetimepicker is this?
[15:32:06] <tripflex> yup already have it ready to go, was just thinking about where to place my auto init for clients that are not doing any customizations :P
[15:32:08] <robertmaxrees> ah i see.
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> tripflex you don't heh.
[15:32:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't autoinit at all :)
[15:32:33] <tripflex> well this is for a WordPress plugin so i kinda have to, otherwise it would never work :P
[15:32:49] <tripflex> sorry guess i should have been more specific as it not being a jQuery plugin :P
[15:33:00] <robertmaxrees> kanga what's the HTML that gets output for this?
[15:33:29] <robertmaxrees> kanga and which datetimepicker?
[15:33:33] <kanga> robertmaxrees jquery.datetimepicker.full.js , I got it from here  https://plugins.jquery.com/datetimepicker/
[15:33:34] <robertmaxrees> trying to make a fiddle.
[15:33:51] <kanga> I don't fully understand what you mean by html output
[15:33:58] <tripflex> thanks for the help @robertmaxrees
[15:34:06] <robertmaxrees> kanga the actual markup - jquery doesn't interact with ASP.
[15:34:49] <kanga> what I pasted should be the only aspects of my website that deals with the picker
[15:35:05] <kanga> ie it functions almost fully after inputting that code
[15:35:06] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:35:12] <robertmaxrees> kanga ASP outputs html.
[15:35:14] <kanga> I am dumb, so I apologize.
[15:35:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do anything server-side.  it works with the html that gets output to the browser.
[15:35:43] <robertmaxrees> if you look at the source on your page, you'll notice that it's HTML that's output, not ASP./
[15:36:05] <kanga> <input name="laydownprocessstartdatetime" id="laydownprocessstartdatetime" style="width: 300px;" type="text" value="Select Date and Time">
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> humm...
[15:38:07] <robertmaxrees> trying to fiogure out what i need to make a fiddle.
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> kanga ah https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wh5r84z1/
[15:41:00] <robertmaxrees> so this is what you have now?
[15:41:25] <kanga> yup!
[15:41:31] <kanga> is it only allowing x:10 on your machine, too?
[15:41:39] <robertmaxrees> in the display field yeah.
[15:42:53] <robertmaxrees> did you read the docs on how to format it?
[15:46:34] <kanga> not in their entirety
[15:46:48] <robertmaxrees> https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/#format
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> which links to http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> you were using "m" for minutes, but that's actually "Numeric representation of a month, with leading zeros"
[15:47:18] <robertmaxrees> you want 'i'
[15:47:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wh5r84z1/1/
[15:48:51] <kanga> <3 <3 <3 <3
[15:49:01] <robertmaxrees> so basically, read the docs ;)
[15:49:05] <kanga> "RTFM"
[15:49:08] <kanga> what a relief!
[15:49:13] <robertmaxrees> it was putting out :10 because you were always using october.,
[15:49:13] <kanga> thank you my friend
[15:49:21] <kanga> ahh
[16:06:10] <codecutter> instead of doing 'symbol.endWith('')' for both can i get do the following? (its never both):
[16:06:10] <codecutter> symbol = symbol.split('=')[0];
[16:06:11] <codecutter> symbol = symbol.split('.')[0];
[16:06:50] <codecutter> it either one of those or none (no '.' or '=')
