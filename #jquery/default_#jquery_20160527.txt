[00:08:11] <WebDevB> Hey guys anyone around?
[00:16:49] <printForever> I'm looking at someones elses code, he created a function with no input and output, just an event. http://pastebin.com/j94fRzSU
[00:17:22] <printForever> how can I access this function? I tried toggleVat(), but it returns unindentified
[00:17:41] <printForever> sorry, undefined
[00:22:44] <printForever> any input is appreciated
[00:22:55] <Uhkis> printForever: can i use that as a reference for totally unreadable code? :D
[00:23:15] <printForever> :( sure...
[00:23:30] <printForever> I guess he assigned two states 0 and 1
[00:23:37] <printForever> and then he tried to do something
[00:23:44] <printForever> I have no clue
[00:24:05] <printForever> I wanted to call on the toggleVat() and pass a parameter
[00:25:15] <printForever> Uhkis, I tried toggleVat(0) and  toggleVat(1) but it returns undefined
[00:25:34] <Uhkis> that function doesnt return anything, that's completely normal
[00:28:26] <printForever> Uhkis, how do I call upon it and "change the Vat"?
[00:28:37] <printForever> I mean, toggle it
[00:29:13] <printForever> I tried $('body').click(function { $topggleVat(); } }); but it returned $toggleVat is not defined.
[00:32:03] <Uhkis> 1) you call it: toggleVat(123) 2) it seems to toggle some *backend* thing
[00:32:29] <printForever> Uhkis, I tried the 1) it failed
[00:32:34] <printForever> 2) ... how can I trace it?
[00:33:51] <Uhkis> no idea, check your backend?
[00:34:29] <Uhkis> in any case, you should ask the author of that horrible piece of ...code
[00:34:31] <printForever> this is the full JS code http://pastebin.com/VcJvJz0b
[00:35:00] <printForever> line 27 contains something similar to the toggleVat
[00:35:58] <printForever> as I undetstand it, it sets the globalVatState to be different than 0
[00:37:27] <printForever> but the problem is, why is it set after the function? if JS is executed in a linear manner, the globalVatState wont affect the toggleVat()
[00:38:01] <printForever> btw. Uhkis, thanks for reaching out to help me understand this, you are the real MVP
[00:39:39] <Uhkis> i think that #27 sets globVatState to TRUE
[00:40:10] <Uhkis> because = true is clearly less readable than !0 :D
[00:40:22] <Uhkis> so negative code
[00:40:24] <printForever> I think so yes
[00:41:15] <printForever> however, when I change it to 0
[00:41:19] <printForever> nothing happens
[00:45:26] <WebDevB> Hey guys, I've created a sticky div that works well but I need it to stop at a certain point... Can anyone help me out.
[00:46:05] <Uhkis> printForever: so you do like: toggleVat(25); console.log(globVatState); ?
[00:46:44] <printForever> WebDevB, determine the height of the viewport and then decide what height do you want it at. When the user scrolls to that height, change the CSS of the floating/sticky div to margin-top: whatever;
[00:46:50] <printForever> Uhkis, I will try it
[00:47:06] <printForever> Uhkis, it returns false
[00:47:16] <WebDevB> printForever thanks for this, Can I show you what i've done so far?
[00:47:39] <printForever> Uhkis, 25 returs false, 1 returns false, 0 returns true.
[00:48:12] <Uhkis> printForever: so there you have it then?
[00:48:16] <printForever> WebDevB, sorry I'm unable to check your code out. Uhkis is helping me with something I have.
[00:48:29] <WebDevB> Np
[00:48:30] <printForever> Uhkis, ok... but the bloody button wont move :(
[00:49:10] <Uhkis> button wont move..?
[00:49:43] <printForever> https://www.veebimajutus.ee/domeeni-registreerimine/?domain=asdfghjk599&tld=ee
[00:49:49] <printForever> there is a Yes/No button
[00:49:55] <printForever> I thought it was connected
[00:50:17] <printForever> in some way, it probably is, but I'm not registering it
[00:53:30] <Uhkis> printForever: that button seems to work fine, the backend responds with success?
[00:53:53] <printForever> when I change toggleVat() the button remains fixed
[00:54:00] <printForever> "fixed" - it does not change
[00:54:18] <printForever> only when you refresh the page, it shifts
[00:59:59] <WebDevB> If anyone can help me out heres the code: https://codeshare.io/CkLkL
[01:01:51] <Uhkis> printForever: that globVatState should probably be set in a success callback of that post
[01:02:17] <printForever> Uhkis, any idea how?
[01:03:22] <Uhkis> $.post(codehere).done(function() { globVat = 1; });
[01:03:53] <printForever>  $.post(codehere)??
[01:04:04] <printForever> I understand the rest of it, not the first part
[01:05:08] <Uhkis> just like in that spaghetti you pasted
[01:08:03] <Uhkis> printForever: i'm 99% sure this is all you need for that toggleVat function anyways: https://jsfiddle.net/1gzu7aar/
[01:08:23] <printForever> thank you!
[01:08:27] <Uhkis> again, not knowing anything about your backend
[01:08:33] <printForever> right
[01:09:11] <printForever> always, when I see jsfiddle or some other url I expect a dickubut... imgur4life
[01:10:49] <WebDevB> Uhkis, printForever Give me a shout when you're free.
[01:12:39] <Uhkis> i'm always free, but i'm not always available ;-)
[01:13:25] <Uhkis> WebDevB: so where's the code
[01:13:45] <WebDevB> Uhkis, thanks man it's here https://codeshare.io/CkLkL
[01:16:55] <Uhkis> printForever: btw, that logo of yours is scary close to gitlab logo :D
[01:17:26] <printForever> not mine, just doing some testing on the website
[01:17:43] <printForever> close != equal :)
[01:18:27] <Uhkis> WebDevB: please make a fiddle instead
[02:00:39] <Saint_Isidore> hi I'm having a problem with this error: Uncaught TypeError: jQuery(...).progressbar is not a function
[02:01:11] <Saint_Isidore> I'm migrating the code to a new application and not sure why this is erroring on the console
[02:01:17] <Uhkis> did you include the lib where that progressbar comes from?
[02:03:13] <Saint_Isidore> hmm good question...these files have a lot of includes..
[02:03:40] <Saint_Isidore> would that be part of jquery.ui?
[02:04:49] <Saint_Isidore> I found the progress bar here: https://jqueryui.com/progressbar/ but does not say what library must be included
[02:05:05] <Uhkis> so jquery ui, yes
[02:05:18] <Saint_Isidore> is there a way to tell if ui is loaded?
[02:05:33] <Saint_Isidore> besides searching through all the scipts
[02:05:35] <Uhkis> check your html
[02:06:00] <Uhkis> best place for the ui include is probably right after jquery include
[02:07:59] <Saint_Isidore> So this is on a wordpress site..and I just read that jquery.ui is included specifically the progressbar
[02:08:58] <Uhkis> you're probably better off asking in #wordpress
[02:09:39] <Saint_Isidore> http://pasteboard.co/1edHuX8L.png
[02:15:24] <Uhkis> that doesnt mean anything, show the html
[02:18:51] <Saint_Isidore> Uhkis I think I got..had to do with the way things we enqueued
[03:02:32] <spid3rMin3> Im calling an api that has the data I need in 2 JSON files (get the id from json 1 and call url2/id)  to do this, I have an ajax call within an ajax call, the network tab in my chrome dev tools shows that both pages have been recieved, however I get this error : Object {readyState: 0, status: 0, statusText: "NetworkError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttp…s://url'."}  for further info , I have the ajax call set to async:false 
[03:04:36] <spid3rMin3> ajax request to get urls -> push to array ,  ajax request to each url {  builds second url -> ajax2 fires  } -> loads request in network tab (chrome debug)  - second ajax call returns error :Object {readyState: 0, status: 0, statusText: "NetworkError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttp…s://url'."}
[03:08:04] <spid3rMin3> nvm the question ! I got it
[03:11:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:11:14] <hellyeah> morning
[03:20:19] <morfin> hello
[03:20:47] <morfin> is there a way in selector find elements having parent with class .hidden with selector only?
[03:21:09] <Cork> morfin: .find('.hidden > *')
[03:21:46] <Cork> if you also want to allow grand parents remove the >
[03:22:03] <morfin> i am trying to ignore inputs in jQuery validation which are in .hidden container
[03:23:00] <Cork> form.find(':input').not(form.find('.hidden :input'))
[04:01:05] <jh9> Hi, how can I improve this piece of code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ed02babe95fc59b40e04dc027a90c8dd I want to wrap some additional data processing around an XHR's .done() callback. My code works but I feel like there must be a better way to express this.
[04:06:39] <Cork> jh9: function() { return $.get(ur).then(processData); }
[04:06:41] <Cork> opps
[04:06:48] <Cork> jh9: function retrieveData() { return $.get(ur).then(processData); }
[04:07:29] <Cork> .then() returns what processData returns so you can replace the data the next .done/.then function gets
[04:09:28] <jh9> Cork: not sure I understand, does this get me a new promise with the processed data? I'd like to use it as follows: retrieveData().then(...);
[04:09:41] <Cork> one min building an example
[04:18:48] <Cork> jh9: https://jsfiddle.net/8gqpataf/
[04:19:03] <Cork> man i always have to fiddle to get the xhr echo to work...
[04:19:26] <Cork> jh9: change the success: true to success: false to see how the console.log changes
[04:21:44] <jh9> Cork: Sweet! Thanks a lot! (I actually would have preferred the name "pipe" for that, or "map" like in functional reactive programming)
[04:22:56] <Cork> jh9: pipe is an option though map is already a function in jquery so would be confusing
[04:23:08] <jh9> Cork: oh wait, thing is that processData is async itself
[04:23:19] <Cork> ah
[04:23:41] <Cork> i think you can return a new promise
[04:23:43] <jh9> Sorry my example was a bit too simplified
[04:23:48] <Cork> but not 100% sure there
[04:24:07] <Cork> i think .then checks if what it gets is a promise and if it is returns that
[04:24:51] <Cork> jh9: but ya, if it doesn't then you have to do what you did before
[04:25:11] <Cork> jh9: an option would be to use $.Callbacks if you don't want resolve/reject
[04:26:23] <jh9> The main problem that I see with my approach is that it doesn't properly take care of handling failures, because I construct a new promise that doesn't know anything about the XHR promise
[04:26:25] <Cork> then you could do something like var callback = $.Callbacks(), xhr = $.get(url); xhr.myDone = callback.add; ... callback.fire()
[04:27:02] <Cork> jh9: ya, you would have to fire both done and fail from the second layer
[04:27:12] <jh9> meh :D
[04:27:41] <Cork> byt try and see what .then does if processData returns a promise
[04:27:46] <Cork> but *
[04:28:32] <Cork> anyway if you care http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[04:30:48] <Cork> jh9: yup works https://jsfiddle.net/8gqpataf/1/
[04:31:18] <Cork> so just return the new deferred in .then and your done
[04:31:25] <jh9> Cool
[04:32:07] <jh9> One last complication, processData doesn't return a promise but uses .on(...), but maybe one can construct a promise from that: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2c52628f1e5a851ed01b7ddd417d4ff9
[04:32:47] <Cork> jh9: promise is what jquery calls $.Deferred()
[04:33:23] <Cork> so just return a $.Deferred() and call resolve()
[04:35:34] <Cork> jh9: https://jsfiddle.net/8gqpataf/2/
[04:35:38] <Cork> (suppose to fail)
[04:35:46] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/8gqpataf/3/
[04:35:52] <Cork> (with the correct url)
[04:36:54] <jh9> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/96f2747cf242a87cf6738380ecf3a4ea this is what I have now, and it works great! :)
[04:36:57] <jh9> Thanks a million!
[04:37:06] <Cork> np
[06:34:45] <dw1> anyone know why select box .change() isn't firing when one or more intervals (100ms) are running in the bg? :/
[06:46:43] <dw1> seems to be jquery mobile selectmenu touch length related
[06:46:46] <dw1> prob just my weak phone lagging

[06:53:33] <Bear10> I'm attempting to traverse an xml with .contents() recursively and modify all it's text value nodes but I'm not having luck, it modifies but it doesnt carry over as if it wasnt being modified by reference
[06:53:38] <Bear10> Any ideas as to the best way to solve this?
[06:54:28] <decx> shove your xml in a string, make a jquery object from it, traverse and change with find, extract that "html" xml as a string
[06:54:51] <Bear10> decx well thats what im doing basically i think
[06:55:10] <Bear10> perhaps i can get a quick jsfiddle going
[06:57:27] <decx> you're not mutating the original string
[06:57:33] <Bear10> right
[06:57:39] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/c72mtp0p/
[06:59:33] <Bear10> decx, yeah this example is a bit easier than what i'm dealing with i think due to the fact it's not recursive
[07:00:16] <Bear10> could you show me how to do it recursively? im using this fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/william/uKGHJ/1/
[07:00:37] <decx> xml doesnt have textnodes
[07:00:42] <Bear10> well better yet it was a stackoverflow question, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7794741/jquery-parse-xml-children-recursively-how that someone had
[07:00:57] <Bear10> and i saw how to traverse and now was trying to replace it
[07:01:01] <bongjovi> is .el() a jquery function?
[07:01:07] <decx> no
[07:02:14] <bongjovi> native js?
[07:08:06] <Bear10> decx: based on ur jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/13nkcajf/
[07:08:10] <Bear10> this is what im attempting to achieve
[07:08:22] <Bear10> but as you mentioned i'm not overriding
[07:08:52] <Bear10> i'm sure i'm missing something quite obvious
[09:21:08] <baako> Hi guys, i need your help please. https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/21/ i want to show the card icon next to the news e.g. {card icon} MasterCard (Fee $0.20)
[09:21:48] <taplar> font-awesome has some card icons iirc
[09:31:13] <decx> font awesome also has 300 other things oyu don't need
[09:31:18] <decx> roll your own icon font https://icomoon.io/app/#/select
[09:31:58] <baako> decx, is right i wish it had a custom download
[09:32:17] <taplar> just tossing out an option
[09:32:29] <decx> well use the site
[09:32:30] <decx> duh
[09:32:46] <printForever> taplar use fontello
[09:33:01] <baako> taplar, the question is in the jquery how do i add to the class for the related case?
[09:33:03] <baako> card
[09:33:24] <baako>  <p class="card-type  card-type-amex"> {{type}} (Fee $0.20)</p>
[09:33:24] <taplar> check the type to know which class(es) you need to add?
[09:33:49] <baako> if its master card add MasterCard if its visa add Visa etc
[09:34:01] <baako> where in that jquery card i do that taplar
[09:34:11] <taplar> 'jquery card' ?
[09:34:28] <baako> i meant to say
[09:34:35] <baako> where in that jquery can i do that
[09:34:44] <taplar> any where
[09:34:56] <decx> no we're all out of where
[09:35:00] <taplar> your building your own template.  you can change your template at any point that suits you
[09:35:39] <kileraptor1> Hey, having some trouble getting jQuery Mobile to work on an Asp.NET page. I can style anchors for example, but I can't add a popup. v1.4.5
[09:35:46] <baako> taplar, example please
[09:35:58] <taplar> try adding the logic yourself first
[09:36:30] <baako> taplar, okay 3 mins let me try what i was thinking
[09:38:48] <printForever> taplar... your life ain't easy sometimes...
[09:38:58] <taplar> mmm?
[09:39:17] <printForever> I'm looking at baako's question and you trying to help :D
[09:39:46] <decx> getting strong dejavu of hell
[09:39:53] <taplar> lol
[09:40:32] <printForever> you've must have been playin' the old jquery card
[09:44:55] <baako> taplar, my logic wouldnt work i want trying to do this http://kopy.io/G5tqw but i related that the appended havent finished so technically the selector doesnt  exist
[09:45:29] <taplar> right, so you have to find it in the template
[09:45:48] <taplar> your doing replacing right below it
[09:45:53] <taplar> it's the same concept here
[09:46:12] <baako> $('#accordion').prepend(simplate2(data, template))
[09:46:58] <baako> the prepend method havent finished inserting the contents
[09:47:05] <taplar> so?
[09:47:32] <taplar> you have a string that your doing a replace on for object key values
[09:47:36] <baako> i cant do $(".card-type-amex").addClass("Visa");
[09:47:43] <baako> or $(".card-type-amex").addClass("MasterCard");
[09:47:44] <taplar> now your wanting to replace something else in that string
[09:47:49] <taplar> it's not a selector dude
[09:47:54] <taplar> your operating on a string
[09:48:44] <taplar> instead of directly returning the result of map().join(), store it in a variable, do your card logic, then return that changed variable
[09:49:16] <taplar> actually it's would need to be inside the map
[09:49:24] <taplar> you lose context once you do join
[09:50:38] <taplar> comprende?
[09:51:20] <baako> taplar, if i do this http://kopy.io/RyKH0 store its is a string. do i need to do a string search and then add to it?
[09:57:31] <taplar> gotta take care of some prod issues, afk a while
[09:57:47] <baako> taplar_afk, okay
[10:09:10] <Z3R0> Any idea why ajax success returns response object, but fail returns responseJSON object?
[10:09:15] <Z3R0> why I can’t use response on both ?
[10:10:31] <Cork> Z3R0: if what you're asking is why fail returns the raw response content instead of the parsed json
[10:11:02] <Cork> it is cause quite a few servers are broken and returns html even when they say it is json if the status code is 5xx
[10:11:08] <Z3R0> well idk what I’m asking really… success(response) == response.title, response.message…. but on fail(response) … I have to use response.responseJSON.message
[10:11:13] <Cork> and that would mean jquery crashes on the parser
[10:11:34] <Cork> Z3R0: responseJSON isn't cross browser
[10:12:09] <WebDevB> Anyone around that could help with a google maps issue?
[10:12:15] <Z3R0> huh?
[10:12:55] <Cork> Z3R0: responseJSON is browser native and not all browsers provide it
[10:12:56] <WebDevB> Z3RO i'm trying to use the google maps API but I can't get the InfoWindow content to open.
[10:13:09] <WebDevB> https://codeshare.io/9fqQd
[10:13:15] <Z3R0> wtf.. so then how do I deal with that?
[10:13:40] <Cork> Z3R0: $.parseJSON(xhr.responseText)
[10:13:56] <Cork> but make sure the text is json
[10:14:01] <Z3R0> ah I see that now
[10:14:03] <Cork> as many servers sends html there
[10:14:07] <Z3R0> is that only on fail?
[10:14:10] <Cork> yes
[10:14:13] <Z3R0> lovely
[10:14:44] <WebDevB> Cork do you think you could help out?
[10:15:12] <decx> make a fiddle
[10:15:12] <Cork> WebDevB: it was quite a while since i fiddled with the maps api
[10:15:13] <Z3R0> works fine, just wish I didn’t have to do something “extra” on a failed attempt
[10:15:29] <Cork> Z3R0: it isn't exactly extra
[10:15:31] <WebDevB> Cork: no problem. just can't get the ContentWindow to open.
[10:16:03] <decx> damn that codeshare site is terrible
[10:16:15] <decx> if alone for hijacking ctrl-f
[10:16:45] <WebDevB> decx no problem, i'll add it to a fiddle now.

[10:45:23] <taplar> fun fun fun
[10:45:30] <shayla> Hi guys, i'm having a problem with select an options. I take the element var maiuscola = jQuery("select").find('option:contains("maiuscola")');  then jQuery(maiuscola.attr('selected', true));
[10:45:47] <shayla> The first time all works right
[10:46:01] <shayla> But then if I change the options
[10:46:09] <shayla> And re-do jQuery(maiuscola.attr('selected', true));
[10:46:13] <shayla> Nothing happen
[10:46:14] <taplar> use prop instead
[10:48:39] <shayla> Thanks taplar. Now it seems to work. What is the problem with attr?
[10:48:58] <taplar> you going to make me lie here, lol
[10:49:04] <taplar> prop changes the state in the dom
[10:49:12] <decx> you dont change the prop of the option
[10:49:17] <decx> you just set the val of the select
[10:49:40] <taplar> or that
[10:50:43] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr for some reading
[10:52:47] <taplar> hellier: just replace your option with what you want
[10:53:12] <shayla> Thanks taplar
[10:53:16] <taplar> like one of the suggested answers says
[10:54:02] <decx> why is it in a string in the first place
[10:54:35] <taplar> heh, and why not just change the original string
[10:55:58] <taplar> baako: any luck?
[11:05:52] <baako> taplar, nah am going to it this way https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/26/
[11:06:07] <baako> i wanted to do it the other way so i can use font awesome
[11:06:24] <baako> but due to lack of knowledge with jquery will do it that way
[11:08:54] <taplar> cool, for reference then: https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/27/
[11:22:13] <baako> taplar, but how will you have add to class to it?
[11:22:53] <baako>  <p class="card-type card-type-amex"> {{type}} (Fee $0.20)</p> how will you have add the class amex if the card was American express
[11:22:57] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/28/
[11:22:59] <taplar> replace something in the 'newCard' with what the class should be
[11:24:49] <baako> i thought it will be
[11:24:50] <baako> else if (e.type === 'American Express'){ $(".card-type card-type-amex").addClass("amex"); }
[11:25:07] <sigdk> is it this the right place to show some code for DataTables ?
[11:25:11] <taplar> your doing replace else where
[11:25:20] <taplar> why are you so focused on doing a selector now?
[11:25:36] <baako> didnt know taplar
[11:25:41] <baako> "lack of knowledge"
[11:26:06] <taplar> lol, your literally doing it a few lines up
[11:26:58] <taplar> template.replace(/\{\{(\S+)\}\}/g, function(match, p1) { ....
[11:27:05] <taplar> you understand what that's doing right?
[11:28:13] <baako> taplar, honestly no
[11:28:39] <taplar> ok, so it's always a good idea to understand the logic your manipulating, :|
[11:29:12] <taplar> template is a string.  what that is doing is performing a search on it for patters that match {something}
[11:29:51] <taplar> when it matches, it passes the 'something' into the function callback which lets you return what value your matched '{something}' should be replaced with
[11:30:39] <sigdk> Here 's some code: http://paste.debian.net/708794/  Whever I load the table, I get a popup saying: "requested unknown parameter '3' for row 0".  Then the table is populated with the last column missing
[11:31:53] <taplar> baako: https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/29/
[11:32:31] <taplar> so with that in mind, how replace works, you now are wanting to have some other placeholder and change it to be your card image
[11:35:04] <baako> taplar, i cant used a placeholder like {{}} anymore
[11:35:17] <taplar> so go with something else
[11:35:26] <taplar> your not limited to {{}}
[11:43:39] <baako> :(#]#
[11:53:53] <baako> taplar, oh well cant do it
[11:54:08] <taplar> what's confusing you?
[11:54:22] <puff> taplar: fwiw, I got that bandwidth dial all sorted out.
[11:54:32] <puff> taplar: User demo in 66 minutes, so we'll see...
[11:54:34] <taplar> puff: cool
[11:56:50] <taplar> baako: https://jsfiddle.net/wso2wu9j/
[11:56:58] <taplar> it's just a replace dude
[11:59:47] <newbie> quickie question i am using the Bootstrap Star Rating jquery plugin..
[12:00:18] <newbie> which outputs stars as in your <input> field.
[12:00:36] <newbie> the html is: <input type="number" value="" id="rating_3" name="rating_3" class="rating rating-loading" data-min="0" data-max="5" data-step="1" data-size="xs">
[12:01:19] <newbie> and on using firebug, the jquery is submitting the value..console.log($("#rating_3").val()); // gives 3
[12:02:18] <newbie> however on posting the form, none of the jquery values, (or even names) appear in the $_POST data in php.. any suggestions
[12:02:34] <robertmaxrees> i joined halfway through that.
[12:02:38] <robertmaxrees> can you show your code in a fiddle?
[12:02:45] <newbie> like rating_3 isnt even in the $_POST data
[12:03:04] <taplar> check the network tab request to make sure they're put on the request
[12:03:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:03:44] <huck5> I have a webpage that needs to load a lot of content... I want to show a spinner while this is taking place,so that the user doesn't think their browser has frozen. Currently I have a spinner showing, but the page is empty/blank for quite a few seconds prior to showing the spinner... Is there any way I can force the spinner to show before I start loading all the other content?
[12:04:00] <robertmaxrees> huck5 how are you showing the spinner?
[12:04:35] <puff> taplar: If you're curious, https://jsfiddle.net/u95yy21n/59/
[12:04:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd make sure it's apart of the basic HTML for the page and then make sure it's one of the first things that loads huck5
[12:04:49] <huck5> robertmaxrees, it's a css spinner I'm calling in the top of the <body> tag
[12:04:50] <puff> robertmaxrees: You too, https://jsfiddle.net/u95yy21n/59/
[12:05:02] <puff> robertmaxrees: Got it all working, thanks mostly to you guys.
[12:05:03] <baako> taplar, the somestring variable will that be the cardobject ot the newCard?
[12:05:19] <robertmaxrees> huck5 why does your page take so long to load?
[12:05:31] <taplar> baako: newCard
[12:05:32] <huck5> robertmaxrees, haha. That's a better question, really.
[12:05:41] <robertmaxrees> huck5 ;)
[12:05:48] <puff> huck5: Maybe load a short, minimal page first, with just the spinner, then have that load the larger page?
[12:05:50] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason you don't see loading icons like that much any more.
[12:06:08] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, i'd fix the fundamental loading problem instead of doing a bandaid.
[12:06:45] <puff> I remember the heady days of 1996, when the consumer bank homepage I was working on was a behemoth at 80K.
[12:06:48] <baako> taplar, hmm https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/30/
[12:06:53] <huck5> robertmaxrees, puff: cool, thanks for your suggestions :)
[12:07:42] <taplar> baako: store the result back in newCard
[12:07:51] <taplar> it doesn't change the original string
[12:08:01] <baako> taplar, thanks
[12:08:13] <puff> Part of me wants to do more of this sort of visual control/javascript front end stuff.  It's really visceral.
[12:08:16] <decx> hope you get paid by the hour
[12:08:20] <taplar> if it did your template variable would be fubared, :P
[12:18:53] <taplar> see if restarting my laptop fixes my display driver crash.  i think it's dieing!  :((
[12:19:41] <newbie> it's bizarre, but the "normal" part of the form submits, but the inputs using the jquery plugin inputs doesnt reach post at all...
[12:19:54] <newbie> https://jsfiddle.net/vna8zsym/1/
[12:19:54] <robertmaxrees> newbie what plugin?
[12:20:01] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:20:02] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:20:18] <robertmaxrees> so jquery doesn't read PHP - you need to show us the actual markup and what your code looks like.
[12:20:41] <newbie> Bootstrap Star Rating by Krajee!
[12:21:06] <robertmaxrees> Yeah, show us your actual html and js and stuff.
[12:21:38] <newbie> i have a multipart form with some fancy stars.. using input fields and a jquery plugin.. but none of the stars. (names or values) ever make it to the post data
[12:21:53] <robertmaxrees> right.  so if you could show us your code, that'd be great :)
[12:22:00] <newbie> https://jsfiddle.net/vna8zsym/1/
[12:22:13] <robertmaxrees> i think you may have forgotten to hit "update"?
[12:22:19] <newbie> its codeigniter mixed in there.. just ingore that bit
[12:22:48] <robertmaxrees> errr, so javascript doesn't interact with your php at all.  it's concerned with your html.  so it'd be really helpful to see the actual rendered html.
[12:27:57] <newbie> okay.. html only
[12:27:59] <newbie> https://jsfiddle.net/vna8zsym/4/
[12:29:37] <newbie> i get the uploaded file, the title, comments, but all the rating data doesnt make it to post
[12:30:02] <newbie> not even the variable names
[12:30:53] <newbie> the plugin is from http://plugins.krajee.com/star-rating
[12:36:52] <newbie> yo?
[12:38:20] <robertmaxrees> sorry, gotta dayjob :) so what about your JS?
[12:39:03] <taplar> doesn't look like there is an #input-22 in that markup
[12:45:21] <newbie> https://jsfiddle.net/vna8zsym/6/
[12:46:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vna8zsym/7/
[12:46:25] <newbie> the js is a long ass file from the plugin.. the documentation says that you can initialize just using html data attributes
[12:46:27] <robertmaxrees> rather, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vna8zsym/8/
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> no reason to include the plugin source - just link it using the extenral resources.  can include jquery and bootstrap, too.
[12:47:16] <robertmaxrees> also you don't put script tags in the html section.
[12:47:53] <newbie> #input-22 was me messing around trying to get in to work
[12:47:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vna8zsym/9/ this is what you're looking for it seems like
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that the plugin is updating the stars at all.
[12:50:03] <robertmaxrees> rather, the inputs.
[12:52:50] <newbie> firebug does give the correct values when you go console.log($('#rating_1).val())
[12:53:02] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle i'm getting 0 pretty much always.
[12:54:12] <newbie> even without the values.. how can the variable names not be submitted to post? thats what i dont get
[12:54:13] <shakil> hello
[12:54:18] <shakil> I have a js problem
[12:54:32] <shakil> I am working on a click event on window resize
[12:54:54] <shakil> that click event works on normal state too..
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> shakil show us a jsfiddle of your code.
[12:55:27] <shakil> so when the window is resized. and an user clicks on the button. code of both states start to work
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> shakil are you adding another binding in the resize handler?
[12:56:37] <shakil> i'm using .resize method with an anonymous function
[12:56:41] <shakil> giving you a link
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> newbie looking at the rendered page in the inspector, there's something really weird going on - the form is getting closed before the star ratings.
[12:57:37] <taplar> his form is in the first div row
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yep.
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> he opens it in the first row and then closes it.
[12:58:00] <shakil> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/4rt27j3r/
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> newbie fix your markup :) flip that form tag with the <div class="row"> right before it.
[12:58:46] <decx> dont add events in a function
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> shakil noooo
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:58:57] <shakil> how?
[12:58:57] <robertmaxrees> don't bind even handlers within other handlers.
[12:59:18] <robertmaxrees> abstract countedHeight into a function and call that in your click handler.
[12:59:20] <shakil> how is it supposed it be done?
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> then bind that outside of the resuize handler.
[12:59:26] <shakil> i see
[12:59:28] <decx> it's already in the same scope, there's 0 need for extra
[12:59:34] <decx> countedHeight that is
[12:59:52] <decx> just dont assign it new in the function
[13:00:56] <saslam> anyone has experience with jQuery doMenu: http://mechanicious.github.io/domenu/ ?
[13:01:52] <taplar> draggable menu, :/
[13:01:54] <saslam> I am trying to control the number of children a parent item can have in jQuery doMenu
[13:01:57] <saslam> yes
[13:02:19] <newbie> holy shit you did it
[13:02:24] <saslam> almost
[13:03:34] <newbie> i didnt think that <div> tags could make a difference to a form
[13:04:25] <taplar> your structuring your dom
[13:04:39] <taplar> elements can't belong to multiple parents
[13:04:47] <taplar> horizonally
[13:05:24] <decx> two divs make a span?
[13:06:32] <taplar> two devs to make a span seems like overkill
[13:07:09] <decx> this.parentStepNode.notmyrealmum
[13:08:49] <taplar> i'm so glad i'm not uxer
[13:10:17] <taplar> anywho
[13:10:25] <taplar> saslam: looks like there is a 'maxDepth' option
[13:10:38] <taplar> well that's nesting limit
[13:10:45] * taplar browses more
[13:11:06] <newbie> thank you robertmaxrees :-)
[13:11:07] <saslam> taplar, yes, that's the nesting limit. I want siblings depth
[13:12:48] <taplar> might have to do an event binding for onCreateItem and do your logic in there
[13:14:47] <saslam> taplar, I was trying to add some login in the "dragMove: function(e) { ... }" to limit, but couldn't figure out how
[13:15:31] <shakil> robertmaxrees should not I use window.resize?
[13:16:51] <taplar> i don't see a dragMove in this thing.  i see an onItemDrag
[13:17:37] <saslam> it's in the source code
[13:17:40] <taplar> and maybe onItemDrop if that fires before it's added to the sublevel
[13:17:43] <saslam> I can change the source code
[13:17:56] <taplar> in which case you could possibly cancel it to prevent the add from going forward
[13:18:10] <taplar> dunno, you'll have to play around with it
[13:18:54] <saslam> letme try to cancel it from onItemDrop
[13:19:33] <taplar> shakil: decx told you earlier you don't need that second binding in the resize
[13:19:42] <mad_hatter> how do i get .ajax to stop issuing GET requests to my server?
[13:19:42] <taplar> you've already bound that event to that item
[13:20:00] <taplar> mad_hatter: you want to stop them or change them to a different method?
[13:20:28] <mad_hatter> stop after i have gotten the requested json
[13:20:39] <shakil> taplar so I don't need to add onclick event binding?
[13:20:40] <taplar> it's already stopped at that point
[13:20:55] <taplar> shakil: your already doing that before your resize binding.
[13:20:59] <taplar> look at your logic
[13:21:04] <taplar> those two pieces are close to identical
[13:21:07] <shakil> taplar got it
[13:21:08] <mad_hatter> taplar, it keeps trying to GET  the web service
[13:21:13] <mad_hatter> even after ive gotten the data i need
[13:21:28] <taplar> mad_hatter: sounds like your in some sort of loop
[13:21:59] <taplar> or you've multi-binded the event handler multiple times so it's firing over and over
[13:22:20] <shakil> yah. that was happenin
[13:24:33] <robertmaxrees> back.
[13:35:50] <jose3_> I have a question about this : "document.getElementById('hear').scrollIntoView();"
[13:35:59] <jose3_> when I call this from my chrome console it works
[13:36:19] <jose3_> but when I put it inside of a button click it goes to that section then back to the original section
[13:36:24] <jose3_> WHATSSSS UPPPPP WIT DAT !?
[13:36:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[13:36:55] <jose3_> incoming
[13:37:12] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/23fd0963db6318ce1c79ae1111232f8e
[13:38:03] <taplar> probably a form submit
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u4g27g1t/
[13:38:24] <momomo> is there a good way to subscribe to an event for when an elements content is updated?
[13:38:26] <jose3_> ohh
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> moei i
[13:38:32] <jose3_> that makes sense, let me look
[13:38:39] <robertmaxrees> err momomo i would avoid doing that if possible.
[13:38:53] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i need to be able to do it
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> momomo why?
[13:39:33] <mad_hatter> is there the way that i can get the value of a text box and pass it as a variable into the .ajax data?
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> why not update the code that does the change to call your function instead.
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> mad_hatter sure - .val() will get you the value.
[13:40:24] <momomo> robertmaxrees, crawling
[13:41:00] <mad_hatter> robertmaxrees, even if its using a GET instead of a post?
[13:41:10] <robertmaxrees> mad_hatter huh?
[13:41:15] <jose3_> you were right
[13:41:19] <robertmaxrees> momomo https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[13:41:21] <jose3_> thanks
[13:41:51] <jose3_> one last question
[13:41:59] <jose3_> nm
[13:42:00] <jose3_> thanks
[13:43:06] <jose3_> do you know of a way to disable scrolling to the left?
[13:43:29] <taplar> what's the context?
[13:43:35] <jose3_> basically in that fiddle you made I want this to a form of sorts, so that when a user submits a part they cant go back unless they hit start over
[13:43:58] <jose3_> they can only go forward(to the right) in the form process
[13:44:06] <robertmaxrees> change the way you're doing that set the left offset instead of scrilling the page.
[13:44:09] <jose3_> i want the sections locked
[13:44:09] <robertmaxrees> *scrolling
[13:44:20] <decx> you can hack it but just dont have form steps based on scrolling that's ridiculous
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:44:45] <jose3_> Well I want sections that are locked, i want it to look like multiple pages in a way without reloads
[13:45:40] <jose3_> ok- so how would I lock a user into that section then
[13:45:59] <taplar> they get one section.  they finish it (submit it or click next), the go forwards
[13:46:05] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:46:12] <decx> it's called form steps
[13:46:25] <decx> just google that, try a few examples
[13:46:42] <decx> basicly tabs
[13:47:34] <jose3_> i was thinking something along the lines of how this site works: http://www.vermonster.com/ or this example works: http://parsleyjs.org/doc/examples/multisteps.html
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> that parsley is closer to what you really want.
[13:48:18] <jose3_> yes sir ill look at that
[13:48:29] <decx> they already fucked up
[13:48:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:48:39] <decx> requires tld in the email field
[13:48:40] <jose3_> ??
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> decx is just being decx.  don't worry about it ;)
[13:49:03] <decx> yo bar is a valid host
[13:51:37] <taplar> "We work in service of ideas. Our teams are flat and small"
[13:51:47] <taplar> what does 'flat' mean, :s
[13:52:26] <decx> like a turbot
[13:52:42] <robertmaxrees> basically, little to no management.
[13:53:02] <decx> oh they mean flat hirarchy
[13:53:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:53:10] <decx> hehe
[13:53:11] <decx> flat team
[13:53:18] <taplar> i guess as an end user.... i want that?

[13:57:18] <taplar> hey, at least they don't auto jump down to the next one
[13:57:27] <taplar> *as you try to scroll
[13:59:10] <taplar> oh wow
[13:59:55] <taplar> if you scroll down to their programmers, or whatever, and click on one close to the end, it scrolls past all the previous ones
[14:01:29] <taplar> heh, and if you aren't entirely on that section when you make it go left or right, it auto adjusts so you kinda get a vertical and horizontal scroll effect.

[14:23:39] <taplar> so if it's an acronym it doesn't matter about the first word?

[14:27:58] <taplar> seriously, ask your question dude/lady/person/hommie
[14:28:18] <theAlternative> i have made a sign up login form somewhat like this https://codepen.io/ehermanson/pen/KwKWEv
[14:28:45] <Uhkis> "a password"
[14:28:47] <theAlternative> so how do I call specific one of the option like login
[14:28:49] <Uhkis> decx approved
[14:29:02] <decx> he
[14:29:57] <taplar> theAlternative: 'specific one' ?
[14:30:10] <taplar> you mean a different endpoint depending on tab?
[14:31:26] <theAlternative> when someone clicks a link on a different page directly login option should be shown and not signup option
[14:31:47] <taplar> ah
[14:32:25] <taplar> well i can think of a couple ways.  easiest would be to default to login.  how often is signup your first choice?
[14:33:16] <taplar> another would be to use something like a url param or sessionStorage to put a variable to let you know if you should show login instead of signup
[14:33:18] <theAlternative> ya thats right but i am then need signup to be opened
[14:33:58] <taplar> heh, or a third option, split out your forms and just go to the one you want/need
[14:34:40] <theAlternative> can you please explain me second option ?
[14:34:53] <taplar> are you familiar with sessionStorage?
[14:35:00] <theAlternative> no
[14:35:08] <theAlternative> let me search on google
[14:35:11] <taplar> ;)
[14:35:44] <taplar> you can think of sessionStorage as something similar to cookies.  you can store values that pages can retrieve later
[14:36:01] <taplar> it's session storage though, so it invalidates itself when the browser closes
[14:36:11] <taplar> so there's some self clean up there
[14:36:36] <theAlternative> oh okay i got it now
[14:36:53] <theAlternative> but still cannot get how that will help me with this
[14:37:07] <taplar> so say you have a link that should take you to the login form
[14:37:34] <taplar> you could bind a click handler to that link and before letting the users progress, you stick some key on the sessionStorage to let you know, hey, i need login
[14:38:00] <taplar> then when you get to the page that has that form, it would check to see if that key exists.  if so, and it's the value your expecting, show the login.  otherwise, signup is sshown
[14:40:14] <taplar> clear as mud?
[14:41:14] <taplar> what's the last thing you saw before being disconnected?
[14:42:16] <theAlternative> i asked how I can you it for my purpose ?
[14:42:32] <taplar> ok
[14:43:02] <taplar> so say you have a link that should take you to the login form, you could bind a click handler to that link and before letting the users progress, you stick some key on the sessionStorage to let you know, hey, i need login.  then when you get to the page that has that form, it would check to see if that key exists. if so, and it's the value your exp
[14:43:02] <taplar> ecting, show the login. otherwise, signup is shown
[14:44:00] <theAlternative> okay got it thanks
[14:44:52] <theAlternative> and then if user want to see login page I will rewrite URL as <url>#login , right ?
[14:44:53] <taplar> lol, actually you don't need any of that
[14:45:13] <taplar> *sigh* i should have looked at your form closer
[14:45:27] <taplar> both of those buttons link with a hash tag
[14:45:45] <taplar> so option 2 with a url param already, is a manner, exist
[14:46:14] <taplar> you should just be able to link to https://s.codepen.io/boomerang/a32f9dc21a6e0f88248636a00b9e5a081464373714047/index.html#signup or #login, which ever you want
[14:47:19] <theAlternative> but then thats not working
[14:47:28] <theAlternative> it was first thing I tried
[15:10:21] <taplar> hmm
[15:11:28] <taplar> so back to the important topic
[15:12:49] <taplar> so you guys are saying a/an is based off of first syllable of the word, not the first word of the acronym
[15:15:35] <decx> i dont think there are set rules for acronyms
[15:15:42] <decx> nasa vs ymca
[15:44:27] <Hola> Hello
[15:44:42] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[15:45:05] <Hola> how can I append data to <input value="">?
[15:45:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't really append.
[15:45:19] <taplar> $('selector').data(key, value)
[15:45:28] <taplar> if your talking about data-* fields
[15:45:37] <robertmaxrees> $theInput.val($theInput.val() + 'foo');
[15:58:23] <_marz> side question. im using textual on mac. why does this channel keep changing my name.
[15:58:36] <_marz> i assume its annoying to some of you
[15:58:41] <robertmaxrees> "this channel"?
[15:58:57] <robertmaxrees> the channel can't change your name the server can.
[15:59:14] <_marz> im new to this.
[15:59:28] <robertmaxrees> are you logged in on multiple machines?
[15:59:50] <_marz> no. just one but i leave the app open even when away
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you might be joining again before something else disconnects.
[16:00:55] <robertmaxrees> the server or your client are changing your na,e
[16:01:07] <_marz> cool. ill look into that. thanks
[16:01:17] <robertmaxrees> though i've only seen it happen once today i think.
[16:02:02] <Hola> robertmaxrees: Thanks :)

[16:32:23] <soleado> hi
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:47:19] <jquery001> Hi. I need help for jquery
[16:47:50] <jquery001> How to set input in ajax call with variable?
[16:48:15] <taplar> have you look at the api docs?
[16:49:21] <jquery001> yes, but I didnt found it
[16:49:37] <jquery001> for example I have filled in value for var clientID
[16:49:53] <jquery001> ANd now via ajax I call it like client:clientID
[16:50:06] <jquery001> but its error
[16:50:15] <taplar> data: { client: clientID }
[16:51:04] <taplar> $.ajax uses 'data' for the input, provided you do not stick it directly on the url
[16:52:12] <jquery001> yes I do it exactly like data: JSON.stringify({ date: document.getElementById('datepickerCreateModal').value, client: clientID.value})
[16:52:22] <jquery001> yes I do it exactly like data: JSON.stringify({ date: document.getElementById('datepickerCreateModal').value, client: clientID})
[16:52:39] <jquery001> without value..I was testing some :D
[16:52:44] <taplar> and what is the error?
[16:53:27] <jquery001> clientID not available..I put it through "Add watch" via fireBug
[16:53:44] <taplar> throw in a fiddle the javascript your trying
[16:57:12] <jquery001> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=jM2aj6T8no
[16:57:32] <jquery001> taplar here you are :D
[16:59:15] <taplar> what do you see if you console.log(clientID) right before the ajax call?
[17:04:24] <jquery001> I didnt write console.log, but on alert(clientID), it shows me a right number ..for eg. 1256
[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to use alerts generally.
[17:06:17] <jquery001> I know :) everyday I learn something new :)
[17:06:58] <jquery001> I am just confused why it cannot "read" ordinary variable that contains 4 digits :D
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> errr
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> client: clientID.value, != clientID
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> take the .value off.
[17:09:59] <jquery001> sorry
[17:10:05] <jquery001> I left it behind
[17:10:19] <robertmaxrees> that'll be your problem.
[17:10:30] <jquery001> Unfortenately
[17:10:33] <jquery001> it will not
[17:11:16] <jquery001> I was firstly try it
[17:11:19] <jquery001> without value
[17:11:21] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about when you set it with that change handler, right?
[17:11:25] <jquery001> and the problem is still there
[17:11:44] <jquery001> yes
[17:12:09] <jquery001> JSON.stringify({ date: document.getElementById('datepickerCreateModal').value, client: clientID, eventtype: $('#EventType10 :selected').val(), eventTypeName: $('#EventType10 :selected').text() }),
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> that assumes the changle handler fires before the ajax call.  you positive that's happening?
[17:12:30] <jquery001> absolutely
[17:12:31] <robertmaxrees> *change
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> how are you verifying that?
[17:12:52] <jquery001> on focus out from the field client, I set globally var clientID
[17:13:02] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't guarantee order.
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> set a console log in each and make sure they fire in the correct order.
[17:13:38] <jquery001> ok..I'm just thinking..
[17:13:45] <robertmaxrees> :) just letting you know.
[17:14:08] <jquery001> i will try with console.log..
[17:14:16] <jquery001> can I tested though firebug?
[17:14:27] <jquery001> each line per time?
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> console.log() fires to the js console.
[17:17:31] <jquery001> I've put it console.log(clientID) one line above the $ajax
[17:17:44] <jquery001> also I've added and alert(clientID)
[17:17:46] <jquery001> >(
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> don't use alert.
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> alerts cause the page to not work the way it normally would.
[17:18:01] <jquery001> :) and it shows a number
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> the alert may be masking the actual bug, in fact.
[17:18:14] <robertmaxrees> so use console logs
[17:18:36] <jquery001> but when I comment //alert, thers nothing
[17:18:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:18:42] <jquery001> there's*
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> bnecause the alert halts execution.
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> so don't use it.
[17:18:58] <robertmaxrees> do one right before the ajax call and one in that change handler for the autocomplete.
[17:19:00] <robertmaxrees> see what order they fire.
[17:22:45] <jquery001> I've tried, but apparently it never comes to event handler
[17:23:00] <jquery001> I couldn't follow up through firebug
[17:23:09] <robertmaxrees> are you looking at your console?
[17:23:11] <robertmaxrees> or at the debugger?
[17:23:46] <robertmaxrees> also: are you using jquery ui oorrr...?
[17:24:00] <jquery001> yes, I am using jquery ui
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> because some kind of functioning fiddle at this point would be nice.
[17:24:34] <jquery001> I am looking through my explorer
[17:24:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah I'd get a functioning fiddle going.
[17:27:37] <jquery001> Ok, I will do my best to create a fiddle
[17:28:16] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty trivial.
[17:33:03] <jquery001> robert, Ive created something
[17:33:04] <jquery001> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=jM2aj6T8no
[17:33:27] <jquery001> I dont know how to add value and id through list that I found on jquery website
[17:33:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> also: source: var availableTags = [
[17:34:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> in fact your whole autocomplete setup isn't valid.
[17:35:06] <robertmaxrees> is this your code oor...?
[17:35:10] <jquery001> no
[17:35:22] <robertmaxrees> ... then what's the point of the fiddle?
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:35:25] <jquery001> beacause I use EF 6 and database to pull data
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> use your code.
[17:35:35] <robertmaxrees> you can simulate the ajax calls.
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> just get your markup and js in there.
[17:35:45] <jquery001> and because that you wont able to see that data, I wanted to add yhrough jquery some test data
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> we can mock that with jsfiddle.
[17:37:30] <robertmaxrees> here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8mkmyd46/
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> what does your data look like?
[17:37:45] <robertmaxrees> can you send a sample of that?
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> also: it looks like you're using both jquery ui and bootstrap.
[17:42:22] <jquery001> yes
[17:42:26] <jquery001> is that a problem?
[17:42:27] <jquery001> http://pastebin.com/vBk0bPKg
[17:42:31] <robertmaxrees> why not just use one or the other?
[17:42:37] <jquery001> Maybe this is easier?
[17:42:51] <jquery001> I mean, easier pastebin :)
[17:42:53] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about fiddles is i can run them and modify them.
[17:43:00] <jquery001> I know
[17:43:07] <robertmaxrees> that makes them really easy.
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> but either way, it sounds like you have a race condition.
[17:43:25] <jquery001> I am just trying to set up fiddle
[17:44:41] <robertmaxrees> templating code's actually less helpful fwiew.
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> *fwiw

[19:34:35] <kooss> hey, i'm trying to understand classes in es6, when I create a class and have a constructor, do I need to use the "new" keyword to get the constructor to activate?
[19:49:38] <cannap> koos no
[19:49:44] <cannap> its js not php :P
[19:50:01] <cannap> its not to bad to use keywords
[19:50:14] <cannap> purescript is js but everything has a name
[19:50:39] <cannap> when you know you need delcarted every thing
[19:50:42] <cannap> then why not
[19:50:58] <cannap> sry my english x-D

[19:53:14] <cannap> i mean flow
[19:54:27] <cannap> ok classes are very simple
[19:54:34] <cannap> you have the __contructor
[19:58:28] <Mello> Hi
[19:58:44] <cannap> hi
[19:59:08] <Mello> This for Jquery stuf?
[19:59:14] <cannap> yes
[20:17:28] <kooss> ok, so if i add a constructor to a class, how does constructor get used if not with "new" keyword

[20:17:41] <kooss> cause I can't think of one
[20:50:47] <Kripts> hi
[21:14:02] <groundup> How do I trigger onkeyup event on an element after I've changed the value with .val()?
[21:15:58] <groundup> nevermind .keyup(). Thanks anyway
[21:28:35] <arc_> groundup you can also use .trigger()
[21:31:47] <groundup> No, only one way to skin a cat. That's *my* way
[21:32:12] <groundup> Really though... what's the difference? Trying to learn a little here :)
