[00:05:18] <brainysmurf> I'm using gridly, am trying to figure out how to get the fluid dragging that I see here: http://ksylvest.github.io/jquery-gridly/
[00:06:41] <brainysmurf> With my code, there is a lot of unexpected behaviour
[00:40:42] <j_acobi> anyone using gomobile? fatal error: GLES2/gl2.h: No such file or directory
[00:41:58] <j_acobi> What is the earliest version it supports, cause I have an old android phone and the basic example doesn't work, but on my android IceCreamSandwich device it does work, so it would be nice to inform people that it won't work unless they have at least so an so version eh/
[01:05:55] <tems> Hi :)
[01:17:55] <Nightwalkerkg> Anyone have any ideas how i could make something like this : http://download.cyanogenmod.com/ ?
[01:18:29] <Nightwalkerkg> I need to make a table and populate it with info from the files in each folder. ( Each phone has it's own folder)
[01:28:24] <j_acobi> what's ` in go -multiline comment?
[01:37:49] <j_acobi> you can just embed C code in a go program using: constant myCcode = `void main(){...`
[02:42:19] <cluelessperson> hey guys.  How do you parse a variable containing raw html?
[02:42:51] <Kamuela> cluelessperson, google said this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10585029/parse-a-html-string-with-js
[02:44:10] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, there's got to be simpler way
[02:45:50] <Kamuela> cluelessperson, but why? JS and HTML are rather independent. only the DOM and external libraries connect them
[02:46:06] <Kamuela> simpler is subjective at that point, is there a library that includes a parseHtml function? maybe
[02:46:14] <Kamuela> but it will probably look similar to that
[02:46:35] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, hm, I might be better off just regexing the variables
[02:47:02] <cluelessperson> Kamuela,  <i id="position">01:00:00</i>  don't think it's worth anymore overhead than that.
[02:47:07] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, But thanks!
[02:47:32] <Kamuela> what part of the overall design ends up with that as a string anyway?
[02:47:53] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, it is unfortunate.
[02:48:07] <Kamuela> are you basically just trying to work with something pre-existing
[02:48:35] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, yes.
[02:49:08] <Kamuela> because otherwise i would pass the data and whatever other data would indicate it needed to be emphasized, and then craft it with front-end code
[02:49:15] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, MPC from the CCCP software.  I'm trying to see if there's any direct protocol, but it looks like it's all web based.
[02:49:31] <Kamuela> media player classic?
[02:49:36] <cluelessperson> Kamuela, yup
[02:50:36] <Kamuela> yes I think regex would work but I can't really help you there so well...
[03:00:13] <j_acobi> anyone use the gomobile program -how to set the android launcher icon?
[03:37:27] <cluelessperson> Hey guys, I can't seem to update the max and value values of a slider
[03:37:29] <cluelessperson> http://pastebin.com/7HZu9L5U
[03:37:34] <cluelessperson> specifically just the range input
[03:40:25] <cluelessperson> figured it out.   $('#id').prop({ attribute: value }); works

[07:19:16] <jak2000> hi all
[07:19:26] <jak2000> why not run this code, i spect open a window modal:

[10:29:03] <PiL> hello, i have properly selected a callback according to firefox inspector, however, the event never fires
[10:29:33] <PiL> what should i be checking for?
[12:09:18] <Fusl> can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong here? the html element has the correct class but doesn't fire the click event $('#tbody').on('click', '[class^="editfilter-add-"]', function (event) {
[12:10:08] <Fusl> (works with this btw, but it's not what i need $('#tbody').on('click', '.editfilter-add-node', function (event) {)
[12:12:11] <Fusl> uh, nevermind, i will just use html5 data attributes
[12:13:39] <tems_> Fusl that first code you provided seems to work for me
[12:14:21] <Fusl> strange, for me it does not fire
[12:14:26] <tems_> http://codepen.io/climax/pen/eNPMOb?editors=101
[12:14:55] <tems_> try that
[12:16:04] <Fusl> ah
[12:16:13] <Fusl> tems_: try with class='test editfilter-add-cats'
[12:16:21] <Fusl> this breaks the filter
[12:16:30] <Fusl> s/filter/selector/
[12:23:35] <tems_> Fusl my first guess would be that the class selector is selecting the whole class list as a selector
[12:24:07] <tems_> for your selector to work, you can make sure that editfilter-add-xxx is the first thing listed, such as "editfilter-add-cats test" and it will still match the selector
[12:25:50] <tems_> Fusl, i've updated the selector code for you such that it will always work now, no matter the ordering of the classes
[12:25:52] <tems_> http://codepen.io/climax/pen/eNPMOb?editors=101
[12:25:58] <tems_> $mye = $("div[class^='editfilter-add-'],div[class*=' editfilter-add-']");
[12:25:58] <tems_> $('#tbody').on('click', $mye, function (event) {
[12:26:00] <tems_>   console.log(event);
[12:26:00] <tems_> });
[12:27:28] <shoky_> .on doesn't work like that with a jquery object
[12:28:01] <shoky_> also that class should clearly be split, or indeed split to use a class plus data-attribute
[12:28:36] <shoky_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZGqxYV?editors=101

[13:26:54] <Ian___> hi everybody! i have a <div class=teaser><span>content</span></div>. when i do $('div.teaser').html i get <span>content</span>. is there a way to get <div class=teaser><span>content</span></div>? in the javascript console it returns not only the inner html but the whole selection and that's what i need too
[13:27:59] <shoky_> Ian___:  $().prop('outerHTML')
[13:28:41] <Ian___> oh perfect, that was easy, thank you shoky_
[13:29:27] <tems_> $('div.teaser')[0].outerHTML
[13:29:43] <shoky_> that's exactly what .prop('outerHTML') does
[13:30:00] <tems_> yes
[13:55:19] <Vasa> when i do $.ajax , it keeps setting the content type to application/plot; charset=UTF-8   , I tried to set it to application/plot; charset=UTF-16, yet it defaults to 8. is there anything i can do?
[13:55:25] <Vasa> I want it to be charset=utf-16
[14:02:59] <shoky_> Vasa:  from $.ajax docs - Note: The W3C XMLHttpRequest specification dictates that the charset is always UTF-8; specifying another charset will not force the browser to change the encoding.
[14:03:29] <Vasa> shoky_ so that means, if i want to send a custom charset, I have to send it as a 'file' ?
[14:03:34] <shoky_> your server probably shouldn't depend on the charset that the header says anyway
[14:03:35] <Vasa> aka multipart/form
[14:04:05] <jak2000> hi all
[14:04:06] <Unitiser> Hello folks, I was trying to make a simple jquery widget to invert the font color of some text box, however, $(ele).css('backgroundColor') give me a "TypeError: invalid 'in' operand style". I'm not sure why this is not working ... you can see for yourself in the jsfiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/5c4aj0wa/35/
[14:04:16] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/hwruc103/1/   <-- whats wrong why not display the alert?
[14:04:33] <shoky_> Vasa: i'm not sure really, sorry ;)
[14:05:00] <Vasa> shoky_: The real questio is, does the browser try to alter the utf-16 string prior to sending it, or it sends it as is
[14:05:21] <Vasa> I am trying to figure out where the string gets damaged, client or server side
[14:06:27] <Unitiser> jak2000: heres the working version http://jsfiddle.net/hwruc103/7/
[14:06:56] <jak2000> Unitiser thanks
[14:07:08] <shoky_> Vasa: adunno, if you got a live link i can try to help
[14:07:11] <Unitiser> jak2000: 1rst you had a typo in "bntClick" and to target an id you need to put a # in front of it
[14:09:20] <shoky_> Unitiser: you got the arguments to the .each callback wrong. you can just use $(this) inside
[14:12:14] <jak2000> Unitiser: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/hwruc103/8/  press the first button please, why display the alert? and in second button i want get the divtext in an alert how to?  wich is wrong?
[14:12:44] <heller__> hello there
[14:12:49] <heller__> ooh lots of people here
[14:13:17] <heller__> so i've got two div's which contain images that need to be updated every x seconds
[14:13:21] <heller__> any pointers on how to do it?
[14:13:34] <Unitiser> shoky_: I see! Thx!
[14:14:58] <Unitiser> <jak2000>: The fiddle you linked here has only one button, i'm not sure I get what you're asking :S.
[14:16:35] <jak2000> Unitiser: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/hwruc103/10/
[14:19:55] <shoky_> jak2000: just take a closer look at your code.  the wrong button is alerting... hint that your click listeners are not on the right elements...
[14:20:22] <jak2000> yes
[14:20:24] <jak2000> btnClick2
[14:21:11] <shoky_> jak2000: and if you want to get the html, you get it with .html()   just like how you used it to set the html.  not .val()
[14:22:17] <jak2000> shoky_ thanks
[14:22:41] <Unitiser> jak200: You should also try to use #btnClick2 in the seccond call
[14:22:57] <Unitiser> i mean, the seccond selector
[14:40:48] <bastones> heller__, if the images are changing every x seconds, you could have a function executed in a setTimeout(), and have a variable that increments by 1 (a counter, in other words) each time the function is executed and show() the index of the div that corresponds to the increment value and hide the rest ( e.g. $('div').eq(counter).show().siblings().hide() ). you would also need to check when the counter has reached the end of all the div's so you
[14:40:49] <bastones> can reset the counter, etc.
[14:45:23] <heller__> well one image for example is a graph of sensor values
[14:45:36] <heller__> and i want it to update even if no one manually updates is
[14:45:55] <heller__> and one image is a button, which i need to update every second if it changes
[14:49:14] <heller__> bastones: i actualyl have this line window.setInterval(function() { $("#kuva").load("index.php #kuva"); }, 1000);
[14:49:18] <heller__> but its not working
[14:49:22] <bastones> It's difficult to give specific guidance on something like this without the context, but I think a good place to start (and perhaps for your situation what I've suggested is no good), would be the JavaScript setTimeout() function which is a good method to ensure a block of JavaScript code gets executed every xyz milliseconds. So if you want to execute a block of code every 2 seconds, you'd use setTimeout(function(){},2000)
[14:49:25] <heller__> its an example, and i dont quite know what it actually does
[14:52:51] <bastones> The code should in theory work, so there must be something wrong with $("#kuva").load("index.php #kuva"). Have you checked if there are any errors in the Developer Tools in your browser? (For Chrome and Firefox, Ctrl + Shift + I).
[14:53:23] <bastones> (switch to the Console tab in the Developer Tools)
[15:02:35] <bastones> heller__ : here's the difference between setInterval() and setTimeout() : http://pastebin.ca/3074851
[15:03:50] <bastones> setInterval() continues to execute until it is stopped, setTimeout() executes only once. However, you can make a setTimeout() execute continuously as you can see in the code example I've linked to.
[15:34:03] <heller__> bastones: hmm
[15:35:16] <heller__> bastones: how about the line pasted?
[15:36:20] <heller__> should it work like it searches for div id="kuva" and tries to update it?
[15:46:17] <bastones> heller__ Hmm, it might be because you're trying to include #kuva from another HTML document when the id #kuva is already being used by a div on the page the JavaScript is being executed from.
[15:48:58] <bastones> heller__ As far as I am aware (and I might be wrong, as I have never needed to use the load() method), jQuery will extract <div id="kuva">...</div> from index.php and output it. If this is true, it will be doing this: <div id="kuva"><div id="kuva"></div></div>. As I am sure you know, IDs must be unique and cannot be used twice.
[15:50:13] <heller__> well the id="kuva" is not used elsewhere
[15:50:27] <heller__> i only use it on the refresh and css-file
[16:20:12] <heller__> eh
[16:20:38] <heller__> bastones: seems like i really am total beginner with these. i need to download jquery to use it? :)
[16:34:31] <bastones> heller__ Yes jQuery doesn't work unless the library is included in your HTML document :)
[16:36:45] <heller__> did not know it
[16:36:50] <bastones> And do make sure to wrap your jQuery code in the $(document).ready() function as seen here: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[16:36:55] <heller__> the line i pasted actually worked a little now
[16:37:04] <bastones> otherwise your jQuery code will be executed before everything else is ready :)
[16:37:15] <heller__> i was trying to use jquery at scrip.js which was for javascript
[16:37:26] <heller__> without loading the jquery itself
[16:37:43] <heller__> it will not try to refresh the page but it only hides the images :p
[16:39:47] <bastones> Yes, simply include the jQuery library above the code that calls your external script.js file.
[16:39:59] <heller__> so do people usually make jquery inside .html or in its own file?
[16:40:07] <heller__> yeah did that
[16:40:16] <heller__> using this now <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[16:48:19] <bastones> Well like CSS, it's recommended you keep JavaScript in its own separate .js file if it is common between two or more pages. However you may also want to do this even if the JavaScript is for one page only, because browsers will "cache" (save) the JavaScript so if the same visitor goes to the same page twice or more, the browser will likely use the cached version of the JavaScript file instead of requesting it from your website each time.
[16:48:44] <bastones> which also saves you bandwidth etc
[16:55:31] <heller__> well i would prefer to keep js and jquery on their own file
[16:58:23] <heller__> but if i have <script src="script.js"></script> - do i put the jquery to same file?
[17:02:23] <bastones> Well, you could put the jQuery library above everything else in the same JavaScript file - I can't see that being a problem, but I would personally recommend keeping it separate. The choice is yours though.
[17:02:45] <heller__> keep .js separete?
[17:02:48] <TeddyMurray> heller__, yeah because if you want to update jquery later you wouldn't have to port it
[17:03:13] <heller__> now i have my javascript stuff and jquery in same script.js
[17:03:22] <heller__> i like to keep index to have all the site stuff
[17:03:30] <heller__> because for me, js and jq only does special stuff
[17:04:22] <TeddyMurray> yes, but if you need to update you will need to copy and paste everything into script.js each time you update, just a personal preference
[17:06:54] <TeddyMurray> but you will have faster loading times if you put them all in one file
[17:06:59] <TeddyMurray> if that's your concern
[17:07:03] <heller__> well its a very small site
[17:07:38] <heller__> what do you mean i have to copy and paste them each time?
[17:09:14] <TeddyMurray> if you copy jquery.js into script.js and put your code underneath it -- you will need to change your script.js each time you need to update jquery.js
[17:12:42] <TeddyMurray> which doesnt happen a lot, usually if you need to use a newer plugin that relies on jquery
[17:13:26] <heller__> i now only have script.js which as js and jq
[17:14:16] <TeddyMurray> kk np, its more poetry than science :3
[17:15:50] <heller__> just curious if its ok way to do it :)
[17:16:05] <heller__> i gladly accept any suggestions and hints on doing this :)
[17:16:21] <heller__> first day with jq, and havent done lot of anything else either
[17:18:06] <heller__> if i have jquery with src="script.js". i can still use <style> </style> inside html if i need the code to be in some specific place?
[17:32:57] <TeddyMurray> heller__, sorry i was away, yes
[19:21:09] <esaym153> so a complete jquery noob here. I am thinking about making a simple orderform/webpage that is (I guess) API/json powered. But not sure where to start.
[19:21:20] <esaym153> So for my example, I need to order a product. But first a product must be configured. So you start on a 'configuration' page which shows all the configurations to choose from.
[19:21:31] <esaym153> I would like to use jquery to build this configuration page by fetching the data from a json providing url, so something like /get_configs.
[19:21:41] <esaym153> Then once the config data is fetched, I want to build out an input form with all the needed config selects.
[19:21:51] <esaym153> Might need to do a few more fetches as some of the config sub options have other things that could be selected.
[19:22:01] <esaym153> So I dunno, does this like a good 'first project' or just dumb/wayoff??
[19:22:17] <esaym153> digging around for some examples
[21:06:11] <tehopeologist> why is another element firing on this click event?  gist incoming:
[21:07:06] <tehopeologist> https://gist.github.com/tehOPEologist/ddfbdbb9bc54f412a941
[21:07:35] <tehopeologist> when i click on either of the .navigation-subnavs li's, they both fire
[21:07:48] <tehopeologist> instead of the conditional only firing on what i think is $(this)
[21:07:54] <tehopeologist> which would be the one i clicked
[21:08:13] <tehopeologist> can anyone show me what i'm not doing correctly please?
[21:15:05] <tehopeologist> anyone have an idea?
[21:34:57] <Thrae|pc> Anyone familiar with computed styles? I'm trying to figure out why Chrome and only Chrome decides it's fun to hide all my select elements when switching tabbed content in jquery.
