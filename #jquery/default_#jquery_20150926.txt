[00:53:44] <bug> hey guys have anyone used auto complete in jquery ? . I am not able to save ids with value in autosuggest. Is it possible or not ?
[01:29:56] <courpse> Hi, trying to toggle a popup type window, i've disabled background events by ising $(".class").off('click');
[01:30:35] <courpse> But when i use $(".class").on('click') when i close the above layer, it doesnt allow the div to be clickable anymore.
[01:31:11] <courpse> Any suggestions?
[01:45:19] <ffffffffff> hi, this might be a bit offtopic but I’m muddling through writing my first bits of javascript for a chrome extension. Can someone help me convert a small piece of python to js?
[01:45:21] <ffffffffff> http://pastebin.com/yQHJ9rwU
[01:45:59] <ffffffffff> I’m finding bits and pieces, cutting and pasting as you usually do when learning something new but I tend to think in python and thats not helping me right now ha
[01:46:37] <robhol> that's not even good python though
[01:47:01] <ffffffffff> its plenty good, I just wrote it
[01:47:13] <ffffffffff> and it works on the data I’m feeding it
[01:47:14] <robhol> it works, but it's not idiomatic
[01:48:00] <robhol> you should've been using a list comprehension in python. In JS you can use filter
[01:48:30] <ffffffffff> I do understand basic list comprehension, I find it less readable
[01:48:45] <ffffffffff> and I’m not a developer for a living, which is fortunate
[01:49:18] <ffffffffff> I have to use a horrible 3rd party web app hosted internally and they will take a long time to change a small feature, I need to mangle some data as I paste it into my browser
[01:49:44] <robhol> [x for x in sequence.split('\n') if len(x) > 3] doesn't exactly strike me as unreadable
[01:50:15] <robhol> certainly not less readable than 7 lines featuring 2 single-char variables
[01:50:22] <ffffffffff> probably because you are a programmer
[01:50:43] <robhol> now that's just a cop out :p
[01:50:56] <ffffffffff> anyway, I didnt come here for a dick size comparison on python knowledge and a critique of my ‘code'
[01:51:26] <ffffffffff> would likely take you less time to help me with the JS than make fun of my python
[01:51:27] <robhol> that's just rude. rtfm then
[01:51:46] <ffffffffff> “thats not even good python”
[01:51:49] <ffffffffff> go fuck yourself
[01:51:57] <robhol> such violence
[01:51:59] <ffffffffff> haha, honestly help a brother out or stfu
[01:52:08] <robhol> such entitlement
[01:52:10] <arc_> he didn't know you wrote it ... it was good advice from his perspective
[01:52:47] <ffffffffff> now you have a cheerleader, epic
[01:53:01] <robhol> It's python written like it's C or java. That's shitty no matter who wrote it, but yeah.
[01:53:06] <ffffffffff> arc_: can you translate that to js without minimizing my awesome python knowledge
[01:53:15] <courpse> https://jsfiddle.net/5uc8muku/
[01:53:24] <robhol> ffffffffff: your python knowledge is already pretty minimal, it would seem (¬u¬)
[01:53:25] <arc_> no i can't and at this point i probably wouldn't anyway
[01:53:29] <courpse> When i click on a latestitem, it opens my popup type thing.
[01:53:36] <arc_> and that isn't a jquery question so try ##javascript
[01:53:46] <courpse> When i click close on the popup type thing, it closes it.
[01:53:48] <robhol> ffffffffff: this is basic stuff, rtfm and stop being a whiny, entitled bitch
[01:53:57] <courpse> But from then on, seems the even still triggers as if the popup was still there.
[01:54:07] <courpse> When i click on the latestitem divs again.
[01:54:17] <courpse> Can anyone see anything i've done derped with?
[01:54:20] <ffffffffff> oh yep, thanks a lot
[01:55:29] <arc_> courpse this is .. quite strange
[01:55:29] <robhol> courpse: I'm honestly not all that well versed in event handling in jquery, but you could try explicitly detaching the event in the handler
[01:55:45] <arc_> you're using both .click and .on
[01:55:57] <arc_> and you have an event binding inside another one
[01:56:34] <courpse> Perhaps i've misunderstood, i thought i was enabling .latestitem when clicking on latestmovieclose?
[01:56:42] <Whiskey> $(".dataViewBox").not(":first").css("display", "none") <-- How can i make so that work both for not first and not second?
[01:58:16] <imnotarobot> I click on "load more" on a page and the server sends a JSON object. Is there a way to access that JSON object from the console? (it's not saved in a global variable).
[01:58:20] <arc_> courpse this would be easier to understand if you included the html and css, is that possible
[01:58:36] <courpse> Yeah, i understand that.
[01:58:48] <courpse> Is it possible if i PM you the page its on?
[01:58:53] <arc_> yeah sure
[01:58:56] <courpse> Ta.
[01:59:34] <courpse> Shall i still discuss in here? or in the PM?
[01:59:45] <arc_> here is fine
[02:00:07] <courpse> okies, well, if you click an item, then click close, then click an item again.
[02:00:23] <courpse> You'll see its not firing after closing.
[02:01:04] <courpse> Its triggering the clikc on the latestmovieclose instead of the items you click on.
[02:01:05] <guessx> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/Gmb78/2/
[02:01:47] <arc_> well ... all you have is a console log in your event rebinding
[02:01:53] <arc_> which is working
[02:02:08] <courpse> Not really, lol that shouldnt be working after the window is closed.
[02:02:18] <arc_> why?
[02:02:32] <courpse> Why would it do the console.log on the click handler of Latestmovieclose when the latestmovie isnt even there anymore?
[02:02:46] <arc_> you're misunderstanding
[02:02:51] <courpse> I think so too.
[02:03:01] <arc_> that isn't a binding that only occurs when you click on that item
[02:03:08] <arc_> you are creating a binding
[02:03:13] <arc_> on .latestitem
[02:03:14] <courpse> xD
[02:03:15] <courpse> Crap.
[02:03:36] <courpse> okay.
[02:03:41] <courpse> Gotta rethink my logic then.
[02:03:51] <arc_> it seemed like you were doing that on purpose, since you remove the binding in your first section
[02:03:54] <courpse> Thats a lil' confusing tbh.
[02:03:59] <arc_> on line 5
[02:04:16] <courpse> yeah, i thought i was turning it off for latestitem.
[02:04:22] <courpse> Then turning it back on for latestitem later.
[02:04:23] <arc_> that is what you did
[02:04:41] <arc_> well, it's not a reference to the binding you had previously created
[02:04:47] <arc_> it's a new one
[02:05:01] <courpse> OHHHHH.
[02:05:19] <courpse> So, im best to make a funtion, and call the guts to my binding inside that.
[02:05:21] <arc_> the easiest thing to do would be to create a function and call it
[02:05:25] <arc_> yes
[02:05:36] <courpse> Thanks man.
[02:05:39] <arc_> np
[02:05:53] <courpse> I didnt realize it was a completly seperate click event.
[02:05:55] <arc_> wait, sorry, i may have misread what you just said
[02:06:11] <arc_> i'm saying you should make a function and have your binding call the function
[02:06:19] <courpse> Yep.
[02:06:22] <courpse> Thats what i said too.
[02:06:23] <arc_> ok, just making sure
[02:06:27] <courpse> :D, we're on same page.
[02:08:23] <courpse> Aweseome, thanks, all fixed.
[02:09:15] <arc_> yw
[03:13:19] <ffffffffff> hey robhol
[03:13:26] <ffffffffff> check out this epic js
[03:13:35] <ffffffffff> pasting...
[03:13:56] <ffffffffff> http://pastebin.com/etqKu7Dv
[03:14:23] <ffffffffff> im sure its the best you’ve ever seen, thanks a lot for your help
[03:21:54] <Whiskey> $("table").find("tr > td > div > span").eq(1).html("File"); how do i do to select first TR?
[03:22:13] <Whiskey> i try to set EQ after table and add tr there but it did not work
[04:31:30] <caraconan> Hi there. I would like a simple star button that when clicked changes to yellow color, and when clicked again goes back to its initial state. Any suggestion? Thanks
[04:36:52] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/t3up99bj/ How can i add info to a table, whitout break it? Whatever i do it don´t work
[04:38:27] <snover> Whiskey: jquery is not some implementation of StringBuilder. if you want to create a serialized dom string, do it yourself, then append the completed dom.
[04:39:34] <Whiskey> Not sure i fallow, it can append data to stuff, why not append more rows to a table?
[06:00:01] <sharperguy> I used .import to import some html into the main index page. It was working well but somehow it just stopped working and I have no idea how to debug it? None of the imports do anything anymore
[06:10:50] <shoky> what's .import
[06:18:58] <DesignEx> I've got a really stupid/simple question...
[06:19:18] <DesignEx> I dynamically created an input form, and can't access it using the normal selectors
[06:19:24] <DesignEx> What'd the easiest way to get that value
[06:21:39] <DesignEx> Anyone here?
[06:22:12] <sharperguy> Sorry I'm using this <script>$("#navbar").load('html/navBar.html');</script>
[06:22:35] <sharperguy> I don't see any request for "html/navBar.html" being executed at all
[06:23:59] <DesignEx> Is there no way to access dynamically created form fields?
[06:25:21] <DesignEx> trying to access them after with an .on('click','#newlyCreatedButton'.....  and access the val() of the new form fields there
[06:25:27] <DesignEx> Keep coming back as undefined
[06:26:30] <sharperguy> It just makes no sense that it worked fine and i have no idea what happened or how to even start looking to find out
[06:26:37] <morphyeys> Hello guys, have you ever used bootstrap date time picker?
[06:31:32] <guessx> DesignEx, put up a jsfiddle
[06:34:52] <DesignEx> Basically just loading an input field dynamically (through $.load), then on a button click, trying to access it's ID
[06:35:11] <DesignEx> I'm guessing the problem is it was created after the DOM originally loaded
[06:35:22] <DesignEx> But can't seem to get it to recognize it
[06:35:38] <sharperguy> So nobody has any idea why it doesn't work?
[06:41:21] <sharperguy> I'm sure jquery is being loaded at least
[06:44:21] <guessx> sharper are you running it after document ready?
[06:44:32] <sharperguy> ah ok I fixed it
[06:44:49] <sharperguy> scripts need to be defined after the rest of the html that's going to use it
[06:44:50] <guessx> DesignEx are you anchoring to document? for your on ?
[06:45:18] <DesignEx> $(document.body).on('click', '#addNoteSubmit' ,function(){
[06:46:21] <DesignEx> $(document).on('click', '#addNoteSubmit' ,function(){ $('#notesType').val() *This is always undefined* }
[06:47:06] <DesignEx> Trying to get that #notesType's value, it's dynamically loaded in (using .load into a dialog)
[06:47:52] <Uhkis> $(this).find('#notesType').val()
[06:49:20] <DesignEx> Still undefined
[06:50:30] <guessx> two different ids?
[06:50:49] <DesignEx> Nope.. definitely not.
[06:51:10] <DesignEx> #addNoteSubmit is an actual button though
[06:51:31] <DesignEx> not sure if a this.find would find it, as it's not a parent of the input fields
[06:51:42] <DesignEx> that's if it's even in the DOM when I'm searching
[06:51:53] <Uhkis> make a fiddle
[06:52:38] <DesignEx> It includes jquery UI dialog boxes, a couple local php files to import the fields, don't even know how to create a fiddle for all that
[06:53:08] <DesignEx> Just trying to figure out what I can try when an input is inserted after the DOM is rendered
[06:53:53] <Kartagis> I've got a few event handlers for the menu buttons. they work at start, but they stop working when I load the page they are on. any ideas?
[06:54:07] <Uhkis> use the ajax echo api
[06:54:39] <Kartagis> me?
[06:54:46] <DesignEx> no me
[06:56:03] <Uhkis> Kartagis: "the menu buttons" ?
[06:58:06] <Kartagis> Uhkis: http://termbin.com/2azu
[06:58:55] <Kartagis> Uhkis: first 3 handlers are working at first
[06:59:19] <Kartagis> but they stop working when I invoke the 5th
[07:02:56] <DesignEx> Can't figure out the ajax API.  So no other thoughts on getting the value of a dynamically inserted input field (the input & button are .loaded into a UI Dialog box if that helps).  I currently have the jquery code executing in the head of the parent (not dynamically loaded) file
[07:03:22] <DesignEx> $(document).on('click', '#addNoteSubmit' ,function(){
[07:03:22] <DesignEx> var getNotesType = $(this).find('#notesType').val();
[07:04:02] <DesignEx> Both #addNoteSubmit and #notesType are from a simple dynamically loaded file, loaded into my Jquery UI Dialog
[07:04:31] <DesignEx> Seems so simple, but been on it for hours
[07:14:09] <DesignEx> The problem was the usual problem... I am a moron
[07:15:30] <DesignEx> I had the success message for the dialog displaying before I was trying to access those variables.  That success message wipes out of content of the container div.
[07:32:10] <philer> heyo, quick question
[07:32:47] <philer> is $foos.find(".foo") faster than $(".foo", $foos)
[07:33:03] <philer> where $foos is $(".foo-container")
[07:34:42] <philer> k nevermind, I should have checked the API docs first. Apparently they are the same.
[07:57:12] <robhol> I was gonna say. They seem fairly synonymous
[07:57:22] <VectorX> hi can someone help me with this issue, i got a top level menu, with some having a sub level(first one in this case), so when you click "About Us" it show show the sub menu in a sliding effect, but the text appears all at once and well it doesnt go away either, https://jsfiddle.net/bvok0mz6/3/
[07:57:57] <VectorX> ie click first link sub menu show slide out and click again should close it
[09:11:08] <droid909> guys, i'm sending data via $.ajax jquery func i see my data in Request Payload of the chrome dev tools but my $_POST is empty
[09:11:11] <droid909> if i set type to GET it work ok
[09:11:15] <droid909> works*
[09:11:27] <droid909> i.e. i see values in $_GET
[10:50:15] <BlackBishop> any easy way to make something like .. if I have my page load /something#tag .. it should populate a field and run a function ?
[10:50:16] <BlackBishop> for example I want https://serverstuff.info/trace#bad.horse to auto-fill the hostname and run the check() function.
[11:36:10] <bluffinpuffin> anyone who manages jquery.com here?
[11:37:13] <bluffinpuffin> if so, PM me
[11:53:48] <momomo> is there something to improve the scrolling speed on mobile devices, jquery or not.. preferably small and on point
[13:06:45] <ZeuZ> Hey guys, I'm loading a datepicker attached input, but upon reloading the div it is in, with the same content, I cant use the datepicker anymore. I tried to use body.on(click,selector,function) but it behaves the same
[13:11:17] <ZeuZ> http://190.247.204.9/Sistemas/FisioVital -> click "Solicitar turnos / Turnos" in order to see the calendar, the related input is the one at the bottom
[13:32:03] <chrnybo> Good evening.  I'm trying to build a tree in memory, from recursive ajax calls.  As ajax is asynchronous, how do I pass the "place" where I want to stuff something in the sucess handler of the ajax call?
[13:55:06] <robhol> chrnybo: you don't have to think about that too much - Javascript closures will pretty much do it for you, by keeping the "reference" to the object/array the same
[13:57:28] <chrnybo> robhol: Thanks.  At the moment, I'm trying to pass the place as a second arg to the function that starts building the tree, with the root node as the initial second arg.
[13:57:45] <robhol> that sounds like the correct way to go about it, yeah
[13:57:55] <robhol> are you having trouble with that approach?
[13:59:12] <chrnybo> Yeah, seems the recursive calls don't really get a place, but undefined.
[14:01:31] <robhol> chrnybo: sounds odd. Wanna pastebin it so I can have a look?
[14:02:39] <chrnybo> Sorry, it's kindo fo a mess - I'm trying to build an orgchart, but js is prolly less overwhelming to you.
[14:06:21] <robhol> Btw, is the whole ajax thing really necessary? Because it's not really the sort of thing you want to do if you can help it
[14:06:51] <robhol> if you have some control over the source script or data, you might want to just... do the dirty work there and serialize it
[14:08:24] <chrnybo> I don't.  I fetch the data from a sharepoint site of $BIGCORP, where I work.
[14:09:51] <robhol> heh, yikes.
[14:10:06] <DeltaHeavy> I know that feel >: Dealing with it right now. I don't think I can do corporate anymore lol
[14:10:23] <DeltaHeavy> If I was here forever I'd probably turn into mouthbreathing scum and my skillset would rollback to what was acceptable in 2008.
[14:10:28] <DeltaHeavy> HELPER CLASSES
[14:10:32] <DeltaHeavy> HELPER CLASSES EVERYWHERE
[14:11:01] <chrnybo> DeltaHeavy: Easy now, I'm a lisper stuck with same system since 2007.
[14:11:26] <chrnybo> Said system written in '98.
[14:11:49] <chrnybo> This jquery thing is for fun, not part of my job at all.
[14:15:01] <ZeuZ> Hey guys, I'm loading a datepicker attached input, but upon reloading the div it is in, with the same content, I cant use the datepicker anymore. I tried to use body.on(click,selector,function) but it behaves the same
[14:15:39] <DeltaHeavy> ZeuZ: Is it a jQuery-UI widget?
[14:15:46] <ZeuZ> Yes sir
[14:15:50] <ZeuZ> datepicker
[14:16:07] <DeltaHeavy> You need to reintiialize the widget
[14:18:47] <ZeuZ> DeltaHeavy, I'm invoking it like so: http://codepad.org/Yj9PdlAe
[14:19:43] <DeltaHeavy> ZeuZ: Well now you're just reinitializing it with each click which wlil muck it up
[14:20:19] <ZeuZ> ups
[14:20:26] <ZeuZ> but then it was being reinitialized
[14:20:56] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, but it needs to be initialized before you click on it in order for it's event handlers to reregister.
[14:21:17] <ZeuZ> not following
[14:21:25] <ZeuZ> the code that the AJAX call is fetching is this:
[14:21:46] <DeltaHeavy> Why not reinitialize it right after the AJAX call replaces the content?
[14:21:53] <ZeuZ> http://codepad.org/80o37GPy
[14:22:18] <ZeuZ> DeltaHeavy, Sorry, I would but I'm not quite following
[14:22:39] <ZeuZ> What I just codepad-ed, is what the AJAX call fetches and replaces the HTML of a DIV with
[14:23:10] <DeltaHeavy> That's gross
[14:23:12] <DeltaHeavy> Don't do that
[14:23:27] <ZeuZ> how would you go about it?
[14:23:45] <DeltaHeavy> Just have that JS in the AJAX call's function that runs after it successfully completes.
[14:23:48] <DeltaHeavy> After the content is added
[14:24:28] <ZeuZ> ah, I think I get it
[14:24:29] <ZeuZ> let me try
[14:26:53] <ZeuZ> Ok, now nothing works, I changed my javascript to look like this: http://codepad.org/9O9Hi59a
[14:28:01] <ZeuZ> the developer console shouts no errors, but neither fullcalendar nor datepicker work now
[14:28:03] <ZeuZ> ideas?
[15:28:22] <Guest55397> hi
[15:52:58] <fas3r> hello
[18:48:54] <Jon30> what's the difference between outerWidth() and outerWidth(true)
[19:22:53] <shoky> Jon30: http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/#outerWidth-includeMargin
[19:23:34] <shoky> outerWidth() is same as outerWidth(false)
[19:25:52] <droid909> guys
[19:25:56] <droid909> anyone alive?
[19:26:32] <droid909> why whould $.ajax sending data as "Request Payload"
[19:26:39] <droid909> instead of "Form Data"
[19:28:55] <shoky> droid909: how are you calling it? and what exactly is the problem
[19:29:21] <droid909> shoky: the $_POST is empty
[19:29:41] <shoky> paste your code somewhere

[19:32:34] <droid909> shoky: this is chrome console

[19:32:47] <shoky> droid909: http://pastebin.com/TqpgBDV7
[19:34:16] <droid909> shoky: well, this didn't help
[19:37:37] <shoky> droid909: seems fine to me  http://jsfiddle.net/zLnh6q2w/    http://i.imgur.com/d9LXAcj.png
[19:39:04] <droid909> shoky: what do you think this could be, because i have the same code working right on another domain, could this be apache issues ... i don't know what to think
[19:39:15] <droid909> it shouldn't be apache
[19:40:03] <shoky> i can test if you have a live link
[19:41:23] <shoky> droid909: what's the Content-Type header on the  bad request?
[19:41:56] <shoky> should be  Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
[19:42:23] <droid909> shoky: looks like adding trailing / to url fixed it ...
[19:42:58] <shoky> okays
[19:43:06] <droid909> shoky: thats so strange ...
[19:43:27] <shoky> it's probably not ;)
[19:43:50] <droid909> shoky: can you describe why it happens?
[19:44:13] <shoky> no, i have about zero info to work with
[19:44:58] <droid909> shoky: create index.php file in an arbitrary web  root dir  i.t. /my_ajax/index.php
[19:45:08] <shoky> what's a index.php file :)
[19:45:10] <droid909> shoky: use my code withut traling slash in url
[19:45:20] <shoky> sorry i dont speak this language
[19:45:27] <shoky> :P
[19:45:36] <droid909> shoky: well, anycode
[19:45:41] <droid909> shoky: even index.html
[19:45:56] <droid909> shoky: it will still send data not as form data
[19:46:36] <shoky> my jsfiddle had no trailing slash and it sent it fine as form data..
[19:47:03] <droid909> shoky: they probably use url_rewrite
[19:47:38] <shoky> again, me no speak pee eich pee
[19:48:00] <droid909> shoky: its not php, its apache
[19:48:07] <shoky> oks my bad
[19:53:26] <droid909> shoky: and come on, i even helped C# user once, all languages are the same only syntax is different ;P
[19:53:49] <droid909> shoky: well, actualy i want to say thank you :)
[19:54:31] * droid909 never read anything about c, or c# or whatever
[19:57:08] <shoky> droid909: heh sorry for being a bit obnoxious, just joking around, i just didnt have anything useful to say, and wasn't gonna start creating php files when i donno php (and am not too strong with apache either)  :)
[19:57:45] <shoky> and, no probs
[20:30:55] <Mapper99> I'm trying to populate an autocomplete with jquery.  I get a jquery error with regards to a undefined label.  Am I missing something?  http://pastebin.com/2WB0Lwm2
[20:33:40] <Mapper99> I think the trouble begins when trying to parse the XML...
[20:44:47] <Mapper99> I've added the XML I'm trying to parse to the paste - http://pastebin.com/2WB0Lwm2
[23:12:51] <ex-parrot> is Ben Alman's hashchange plugin still the best practice for handling hashchange events, or can I do it with vanilla jquery reliably now?
[23:32:37] <dsc_> if you have 2 ajax json calls after eachother, could one 'mess' up the other? According to Firefox/Chrome I am receiving incomplete responses from the webserver
[23:32:44] <dsc_> which is not true
[23:32:50] <dsc_> I did a network capture
[23:33:17] <dsc_> it's just 2 simple JSON ajax calls to 2 different urls
[23:33:35] <dsc_> but only 1 works, the second one gets an incomplete response body.
[23:33:52] <dsc_> do I need async: true in my ajax call?
[23:33:58] <dsc_> is this a race condition?
[23:34:02] <dsc_> :D
[23:34:36] <dsc_> because if I built in a pause of 50ms between the requests, they both work fine
[23:34:51] <dsc_> and yes, the webserver works fine (double, tripple checked it)
