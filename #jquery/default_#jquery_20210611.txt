[14:37:16] <tuxayo> Hi :)
[14:37:17] <tuxayo> Does anyone know how to disable using JavaScript the Jquery validation (https://jqueryvalidation.org/) of a field or a form?

[14:40:11] <tuxayo> thanks robertmaxrees , I stumbled upon this yesterday. I don't remember why I didn't get by with this. I'll retry.
[14:48:33] <tuxayo> Somehow it doesn't do it. Maybe I should call something else to apply that. Because it's after the page loading and I'm using the JS console.
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:49:55] <robertmaxrees> can you maybe describe the problem you're trying to solve in full?
[14:53:13] <tuxayo> robertmaxrees: I'm testing how does my application handles some input when the client side doesn't do it's job.
[14:53:27] <tuxayo> "sure, instead of disabling it in the template, doing it with the dev tools should be easy."
[14:53:40] <tuxayo> That was me more than an hour ago ^^"
[14:53:44] <robertmaxrees> are you using chrome?
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> tuxayo
[14:55:11] <tuxayo> robertmaxrees: nope, Firefox. If that can help, I didn't even identified the markup or JS that actually enables the validation.
[14:55:12] <tuxayo> So getting my head into this surely helps learning stuff in this area where I don't know enough.
[14:55:47] <robertmaxrees> just disable js in the dev tools
[14:57:41] <robertmaxrees> or use a tool like postman or curl to simulate the submissions.
[15:00:00] <tuxayo> robertmaxrees: surefire idea, thanks! Also the direct request would do.
[15:00:00] <tuxayo> Thanks :)
