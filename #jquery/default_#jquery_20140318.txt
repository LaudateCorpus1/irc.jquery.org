[00:08:53] <jop008> this code worked in jqm 1.3.2 but not in 1.4.2 $("[data-role=header], [data-role=footer]").fixedtoolbar({ tapToggle: false });
[00:09:05] <jop008> has no method fixedtoolbar
[00:12:52] <Cork> aaron1245: you need to bind the click in the page inside the iframe
[00:13:09] <Abbbbbbhi> Need help
[00:13:14] <Cork> aaron1245: click doesn't propagate from iframes, cause it could be used to track actions on the other site
[00:13:33] <Cork> ?ask @ Abbbbbbhi
[00:13:34] <b-ot> Abbbbbbhi: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:14:30] <Abbbbbbhi> I am trying to submit form using AJAX but chrome browser does not prompt for password save . i have tired few stackoverflow answers (such as submitting to blank.html using iframe) does anyone know solution for this
[00:15:37] <aaron1245> cork: even if I don't need to know what was clicked, just that there was an action on the parent div that holds the iframe?
[00:15:58] <Cork> aaron1245: yes
[00:16:05] <Abbbbbbhi> Related answers -http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2382329/how-can-i-get-browser-to-prompt-to-save-password
[00:16:25] <Cork> aaron1245: events would have to propagate cross documents for that to happen
[00:16:47] <Cork> aaron1245: events never fire on more then one document
[00:17:25] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: are you taking about basic auth?
[00:17:45] <Abbbbbbhi> Form based login using Ajax
[00:17:46] <jop008> what is the equivalent of $("[data-role=header], [data-role=footer]").fixedtoolbar({ tapToggle: false }); it worked in jqM 1.3.2
[00:18:14] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: form based?
[00:18:22] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: ah
[00:18:46] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: if you want password saving to be triggered cross all browsers
[00:18:47] <Abbbbbbhi> Cork - Example http://jsfiddle.net/StJ35/
[00:18:58] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: login forms should't use ajax
[00:19:54] <Cork> firefox used to be the worst at this, but they have rewritten there passwords manager
[00:20:03] <Abbbbbbhi> Cork , so that hidden iframe method does not work anymore ? like descriped in Comment 10 - https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43219
[00:20:11] <ns5> I'm using jquery-mobile.  How to locate this <p> "<p class="event received">Device is Ready</p>" and changes its text?  I tried this $('.event received').text('Device is Ready!!!');  But it does not work
[00:21:01] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: i don't think that has ever been enough cross browsers
[00:21:53] <Cork> ns5: are you sure that element exists when you run your code?
[00:21:53] <plepzz> ns5: try $("p.event").text();
[00:22:01] <Cork> ns5: cause that should work
[00:22:18] <plepzz> Cork, he missed a . on the received class too
[00:22:20] <Cork> plepzz: unless the second class is removed that shouldn't make a difference
[00:22:27] <Cork> ah
[00:22:42] <Cork> ugg
[00:22:47] <Cork> it line broke there
[00:22:50] <ns5> Cork: Can I assume that everything that I'm familiar with jquery also exist in jquery mobile?
[00:23:02] <ns5> I guess it should be in $.ready()?
[00:23:03] <Cork> ns5: yes
[00:23:14] <Cork> meaning it exists
[00:23:21] <Cork> ns5: but jqm doesn't work the same
[00:23:26] <Cork> and .ready is one of the things
[00:23:27] <Abbbbbbhi> Thanks cork , i need to explain my team lead , he says i am implementing it wrong, hidden iframe should work
[00:23:44] <Cork> ns5: mobile doesn't reload the full page, so i think ready doesn't work the way you want it
[00:23:54] <Cork> ns5: i think they use showPage or something like that
[00:23:57] <Cork> changePage?
[00:24:04] <Cork> (i don't know enough about jqm)
[00:24:18] <Cork> but it is built on jquery so all the jquery selectors and functions exist
[00:24:53] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: why not just have the form in the iframe?
[00:25:31] <Abbbbbbhi> Nice idea , will try that
[00:25:38] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: also don't take my word for that it isn't enough
[00:25:54] <Cork> i would never do it like that, so i don't have experience from it
[00:26:07] <Cork> but as the iframe doesn't actually post the data
[00:26:17] <Cork> i can at least say old firefox wouldn't have triggered on it
[00:26:20] <Abbbbbbhi> ohh
[00:26:26] <Cork> and new firefox doesn't need it
[00:26:33] <angel> hello
[00:26:46] <Cork> (the rewrote the password manager is ff ~14)

[00:28:18] <jop008> I had blue colors in jqmobile 1.3.2 switched to 1.4.2 and everything is black
[00:28:31] <Abbbbbbhi> Another question: i want to resize frame based on the contents on frame but i came to know that onresize event triggers only when window get resized. (for same domain iframe) . is there any way of doing it without using settimeout
[00:29:21] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: seamless iframes is meant to do it
[00:29:37] <Abbbbbbhi> but only supported in html5 :(
[00:29:39] <angel> i have this code in my html <a id="idcont" user-id="12"></a> and this code in my js: user_id = $("#idcont").attr("user-id"); but i got this error: SyntaxError: missing : after property id. Am i missing something?
[00:29:39] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: though there isn't cross browser support yet
[00:29:49] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: html5 is just marketing
[00:30:02] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: but yes it isn't implemented in all browsers yeet
[00:30:05] <Cork> *yet
[00:31:29] <angel> Cork and Abbbbbbhi i already send the question.. please help me
[00:31:42] <angel> *sent
[00:32:05] <Cork> angel: too little context
[00:32:12] <Cork> angel: that fragment should work
[00:32:25] <angel> okay wait i save the code online
[00:32:26] <snufft> hi guys!
[00:32:48] <snufft> quick question, is there an equivelant of show() for visibility in css?
[00:33:01] <snufft> i'm fine with doing a css() call, just wanted to check first :)
[00:33:02] <Cork> angel: http://jsfiddle.net/3KUZQ/
[00:33:11] <snufft> google hasn't given me a whole lot on the subject
[00:33:29] <plepzz> snufft: like .fadeIn()?
[00:33:36] <Cork> snufft: no there isn't
[00:33:43] <Cork> plepzz: fade is opacity
[00:33:48] <plepzz> Oh
[00:34:04] <snufft> plepzz, Cork thanks for the reply :) and for answering my question :)
[00:34:36] <jop008> what is done with theming I had a blue theme created by <div class="my-header-grid ui-grid-b" data-theme="b"> what is the 1.4.2 way to do that?
[00:45:16] <angel> Cork maybe its because its inside jQuery.ajax here is my code: http://en.textsave.org/hoP
[00:45:38] <Cork> angel: ya, that isn't valid
[00:45:58] <Cork> angel: you want to send the data?
[00:46:16] <jop008> I have this fiddel http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/225/ when switching the css to 1.4.2. css all page elements turn black
[00:46:18] <angel> Cork so how can i get user-data attr value??
[00:46:21] <Cork> or what do you want to do with user_id and profile_id?
[00:46:31] <jop008> how to upgrade keeping my colors the same?
[00:46:46] <jop008> I read the upgrade guide but not clear to me
[00:47:13] <Cork> angel: ?
[00:48:29] <Cork> angel: http://jsfiddle.net/R2dxL/
[00:50:38] <angel> Cork!! Thank you very much.. it's now working :)
[00:51:09] <Cork> angel: what you did was declare two variables inside an object
[00:51:17] <Cork> angel: and you can't do that
[00:51:31] <angel> ohw.. i see.
[00:51:37] <Cork> angel: also always use var when you declare variables
[00:51:45] <Cork> else they become page globals
[00:52:24] <Cork> angel: also not sure data was what you wanted to do with profile_id
[00:52:29] <Cork> you might want to remove that
[00:52:39] <angel> ahh.. okay Cork
[00:53:39] <angel> no i need the profile_id also i just remove it a while ago to shorten the code when i'm asking
[00:53:50] <ns5> There are some css files in the jquery package I downloaded, do I also need to include the css files in my html to make jquery work?
[00:54:09] <ns5> s/jquery/jquerymobile
[00:54:36] <Cork> angel: i meant data: {} is added as ?key=value param strings to the query
[00:54:42] <Cork> angel: you might not want it there
[00:55:00] <Cork> ns5: jqm and jqui need it
[00:55:13] <Cork> but not jquery
[00:55:59] <ns5> Cork: is this the reason $('#index').on('pageinit', function(event) isn't working for me?
[00:56:15] <Cork> no
[00:56:27] <Steve445> can someone point me to a plugin that lets you diplsay data in a calendar format(variation formats) but rather than show events, you so data?
[00:56:29] <Steve445> Example:
[00:56:42] <Steve445> Dollars$ made per day of week
[00:56:49] <Steve445> showing a full months value

[00:58:07] <Cork> is another option
[00:58:27] <jop008> data-theme='b'  what is the 1.4.2 way to do this?
[00:59:26] <Steve445> trying to recreate something similar to: https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/902901/2445225/1a8a050a-ae6d-11e3-8ae5-6bb3942efe89.png
[00:59:37] <Steve445> forget about format.  just want roc opt structure and table format
[00:59:53] <Steve445> I can out content for the rows and date values
[01:00:11] <Steve445> but looking for something that would format into the calendar view
[01:01:25] <Steve445> any thoughts?
[01:05:03] <Steve445> must be something?
[01:06:22] <Cork> Steve445: google it
[01:06:28] <Steve445> have been
[01:06:37] <Steve445> but the "terms" to search for is problematic
[01:06:48] <Steve445> cause i don't want a calendar of times
[01:07:13] <Steve445> i want a calendar of days, but for each day i want to do a data/number value

[01:16:54] <ns5> sorry I got disconnected.  My question was: http://www.fpaste.org/86248/51295301/  this is code from my mobile app, it uses jquery mobile, I just want to change text of the p when the app starts, but it just doesn't work.  Any clue?
[01:16:59] <ns5> did I miss anything?
[01:32:24] <aton`> i am doing an ajax() call with data:'{\'feedback\':\''+result+'\'}'
[01:32:42] <aton`> this doesnt work because apparently the single quotes must be double quotes
[01:33:37] <Cork> aton`: if you want json ya
[01:33:41] <aton`> but if i use \" instead of \', then my html breaks, as its onclick="... $.ajax(...data:'{\"feedback\":\"'+result+'\"}',...)
[01:33:53] <aton`> i want json, yes
[01:33:58] <Cork> aton`: don't use event attributes
[01:34:28] <Cork> aton`: move the js out of the html and into the js resource
[01:34:28] <aton`> but instead?
[01:34:36] <Cork> use event listeners
[01:34:53] <Cork> ex. $('a').click(function() { $.ajax(); });
[01:35:33] <aton`> is a the tag or the name?
[01:35:47] <Cork> aton`: it would bind to all a tags
[01:35:51] <Cork> but was just an example
[01:36:02] <aton`> ok
[01:36:07] <aton`> reading http://api.jquery.com/click/
[01:36:16] <aton`> thanks for the help
[01:36:23] <Cork> aton`: click is just a short hand for .on
[01:36:29] <Cork> ?api on
[01:36:29] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:37:06] <aton`> is it better to use the base functions like ajax() and .on() or the shortcuts?
[01:37:25] <Cork> aton`: ajax has nothing to do with .on
[01:37:31] <aton`> i know
[01:37:43] <Cork> ah, read your question wrong
[01:37:44] <aton`> but ajax() has post() for example
[01:37:52] <aton`> as .on has .click
[01:37:56] <aton`> shortcut functions
[01:38:03] <Cork> aton`: i find post and get pointless as they arn't much shorter
[01:38:13] <aton`> same here
[01:38:16] <Cork> $.get('url') vs $.ajax('url')
[01:38:19] <Cork> :)
[01:38:33] <Cork> the click shortcut i do use
[01:38:35] <aton`> so i guess .on wont be much longer than .click?
[01:38:44] <Cork> but i tend to use .on most of the times now days
[01:40:41] <aton`> Cork: where would i put the code? just in any .js file thats loaded?
[01:40:50] <Cork> aton`: sure
[01:41:08] <Cork> just make sure to wrap it in $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {})
[01:41:09] <aton`> sorry for the dumb question ;)
[01:41:16] <Cork> (if the js is loaded from head that is)
[01:41:35] <aton`> i am a backender who tries to get into angular and jquery a bit
[01:41:47] <Cork> oh, and ofcourse after jquery has been loaded
[01:43:15] <aton`> its loaded from head after jquery
[01:43:47] <fabioportieri> o/
[02:30:52] <d3m0n> Is there a way to gather the position number of an element within the same group of elements: eg. a list of li's grab the second as "2".
[02:31:14] <Cork> ?api index
[02:31:15] <b-ot> Cork: .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[02:31:46] <d3m0n> Awesome. Thanks Cork.
[02:33:05] <ddssc> can I use select2 on something other than a <select> element?
[02:33:29] <Cork> what?
[02:33:41] <Cork> are you asking a new question now?
[02:36:23] <CrowX-> hi
[02:36:43] <CrowX-> why is my php file not getting executed here? http://pastebin.com/SVawNqqv
[02:37:31] <Cork> CrowX-: is the network connection executed?
[02:37:45] <Cork> CrowX-: also are you use the relative path for the php file is correct?
[02:37:58] <Cork> (i recommend using absolute paths to remove that problem)
[02:38:25] <CrowX-> Cork, I use relative path for the php file, yes. they're in the same folder
[02:38:42] <Cork> CrowX-: uh, are you using a webserver?
[02:38:48] <Cork> as you keep talking about files...
[02:39:36] <CrowX-> Cork, yes, I use nginx
[02:39:51] <Cork> CrowX-: ok firstly what js does is not calling a file
[02:39:59] <Cork> it makes a network call sending an url to the server
[02:40:01] <Cork> nothing else
[02:40:08] <Cork> check the connection in the browsers network console
[02:40:14] <Cork> and see what the server does with the connection
[02:41:39] <CrowX-> Cork, where is the browser's network console?
[02:41:49] <Cork> CrowX-: what browser?
[02:42:11] <CrowX-> chromium
[02:42:28] <CrowX-> Cork, what I'm trying to do is to get a php file executed with certain arguments
[02:42:37] <CrowX-> is there another way to do this?
[02:42:40] <Cork> CrowX-: again not file
[02:42:44] <Cork> url
[02:42:52] <Cork> files exist on the server, not in js
[02:43:12] <Cork> if you don't like url you can call it resource, but it isn't a file
[02:43:19] <CrowX-> ok
[02:43:22] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j
[02:43:27] <Cork> then the network tab
[02:43:35] <fabioportieri> do you guys use xss me addon for firefox? seems cool
[02:44:14] <Cork> fabioportieri: no i use noscript
[02:44:54] <CrowX-> Cork, it doesn't show test.php being called
[02:44:59] <CrowX-> why could this be?
[02:45:10] <Cork> CrowX-: is the js actually ever called?
[02:45:34] <Cork> if you set a console.log('ajax call') before the $.ajax
[02:45:39] <Cork> do you see that text in the console?
[02:46:12] <CrowX-> Cork, yes, the other part of the function is executed well, just not the alax part
[02:46:39] <Cork> and no js errors?
[02:46:50] <Cork> (btw you have trailing commas)
[02:47:02] <CrowX-> should I remove them?
[02:47:08] <Cork> ie don't like them
[02:47:14] <Cork> so the code will crash there
[03:08:11] <jop008> I used the theme roller downloaded it include it at top of the page but how to apply it?
[03:14:18] <jackkitley> Hi All. Anyone used KendoUI?
[03:17:36] <jop008> Can someone help me on this my site is based on 1.3.2 jqeyre mobile. The toggle column has a bug in jqM 132 so I swithed for my most important page to 1.4.2
[03:18:43] <jop008> but the theming is completely changed so how to solve this? The page must look the same (user must not detect the jQ version of hte visited pages
[03:19:07] <jop008> The page is this one http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[03:19:39] <jop008> Better to find a solution for the column toggle?
[03:31:00] <Mattias> I was wondering why .get(0) would fail in all IE versions but work in all other browsers. Is there an alternative method I could use? Code is something similar to: $('.class').children().not('span').eq(0).get(0);  <-- up until get() IE can see the object, but when I use get(0) it gets undefined in IE only.
[03:31:37] * Mattias tries updating jquery first
[03:32:33] <Cork> Mattias: just use $('.class').children().not('span')[0]
[03:32:45] <masscrx> If i have binded 2 action for example on click .class in separate 2 files, which action will be last executed? This is randomly or have some order?
[03:32:49] <Mattias> Cork: thanks, will try that
[03:32:50] <Cork> Mattias: it is pointless to do .eq(0).get(0) btw
[03:33:08] <Cork> .get(0) does the same as .eq(0) except it doesn't add the jquery wrapping
[03:33:30] <Cork> and .get(0) does the same as [0] except it is a function instead of an array access
[03:33:34] <Mattias> That's what I get from reusing the code in this project :P
[03:34:23] <Cork> masscrx: both will, unless you use return false; that is
[03:34:31] <Cork> masscrx: and the order is in the order why where executed
[03:35:01] <masscrx> I have some javascript file with action on click .add
[03:36:14] <masscrx> after this action new dom element is created, and I want to make some another action after this but I;m java noob so I;m thinking whether could I make in another fil action binded to element with .add class
[03:37:07] <masscrx> with action which will be run after dom element creation
[03:37:37] <masscrx> https://github.com/lailsonbm/awesome_nested_fields/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.nested-fields.js
[03:37:49] <Mattias> Cork: odd, IE still gives me undefined when I do that :/ and all I see when I console.log $('.class').children().not('span') is [object Object] in IE9 debugger. using modern.ie virtualbox. Is there a way to see the full object there? maybe it's ".not()" which doesn't work in IE :/
[03:37:54] * Mattias experiments
[03:38:05] <masscrx> this is thats script maybe someone could help me where to add appropriate code
[03:41:39] <Cork> Mattias: you should never get undefined from that call
[03:42:02] <Cork> Mattias: you could try console.log($('.class').children().not('span').length)
[03:44:13] <Mattias> Cork: IE9: 0, Firefox: 2
[03:44:16] <Mattias> er, chrome*
[03:45:01] <Cork> Mattias: well there you have a start of the problem
[03:45:03] <Mattias> Oh, firefox gets 0 too.. chrome works though... investigating
[03:45:22] <Cork> Mattias: you prob have a race situation
[03:45:26] <Cork> or invalid markup
[03:46:14] <Mattias> Will try to get it to work in firefox first now then, easier to debug in :)
[03:46:26] <Cork> ya
[03:47:18] <Mattias> Cork: It's a sublime video object. firefox seems to say there's a syntax error in the remove sublime file :/
[03:47:26] <Mattias> remote sublime*
[03:48:47] <Mattias> I wonder if sublimevideo is having problems.. but most likely it's this code :/
[03:51:57] <motaka2> I dont know why this doesnt work?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/7113400/
[03:52:46] <murosai_> i got an array of json objects and i want to convert this to an array of strings by using a certain property in the json objects, is there a more elegant way of doing this than a simple loop?
[03:55:05] <fabioportieri> motaka2: paste your markup too, that line is fine
[03:56:12] <Cork> murosai_: so you want to concat the strings in the array?
[03:56:21] <Cork> murosai_: or do you mean you have an array of objects?
[03:56:29] <Cork> (not json objects)
[03:56:38] <motaka2> fabioportieri: http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/Js
[03:56:45] <fabioportieri> murosai_: try JSON.stringify()
[03:58:59] <Cork> motaka2: you forgot to wait for ready
[03:59:22] <motaka2> :) you are right thx
[03:59:55] <Cork> murosai_: ?
[04:00:31] <jop008> This line works on desktop $(".ui-btn-inner").on("click",function(event){   alert ("test"); but on iphone/ipad no alert
[04:02:11] <motaka2> Cork: not working yet
[04:03:07] <Cork> motaka2: the site still calls $() directly in the js file
[04:03:40] <Cork> motaka2: http://fa.noondreams.com/web/Test/Js.js
[04:04:03] <motaka2> I dont get you
[04:04:31] <Mattias> Fun stuff, chrome works, firefox has the sublimevideo json syntax error which causes everything to fail and IE9 now works 50% ^.^
[04:04:44] <motaka2> Cork: I uploaded the new version
[04:05:14] <Cork> same old here
[04:05:55] <Cork> Mattias: sounds like your using a service that... only cares about chrome >_<
[04:07:18] <skullcrasher> anyone knows how I can select an amount of children (like the next 3 children)
[04:07:35] <skullcrasher> or only children from 2-4 not 1-4
[04:07:43] <Cork> ?api slice
[04:07:43] <b-ot> Cork: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[04:08:03] <Cork> next three is a bit harder
[04:08:08] <skullcrasher> oh nice :)
[04:08:17] <Cork> .nextAll().slice(3) should work though
[04:09:09] <Cork> sich oh chrome you crazy bugger
[04:09:42] <Cork> how the *** do you figure that one out O_o
[04:11:09] <Cork> just got to love chrome... http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=300073
[04:11:29] <Cork> that is a <label>label</label> (<a>link</a>)<br> ...
[04:12:00] <jop008> $(".ui-btn-inner").on("click",function(event){    alert ("test"); on mobile no alert pops up but why?
[04:13:55] <MMS> Hi All
[04:30:36] <Cork> hmm
[04:30:40] <Cork> interesting effect http://jsfiddle.net/eE5Rc/
[04:56:35] <bberry> Cork: that might be really annoying
[04:56:45] <bberry> has potential to be*
[04:56:51] <Cork> bberry: it is
[04:57:05] <Cork> bberry: reduced it a bit http://jsfiddle.net/eE5Rc/4/
[04:57:08] <bberry> reminds me of <blink>
[04:57:20] <Cork> bberry: ah, the animation is intentional
[04:57:36] <Cork> bberry: the problem is the parenthesis
[04:58:19] <Cork> bberry: chrome doesn't align inline elements if the parent has vertical-align: top;
[04:58:48] <bberry> interesting
[04:59:33] <Cork> or rather it doesn't align text with inline elements
[05:01:42] <bberry> ah
[05:03:41] <murosai_> Cork: i have an array of objects
[05:04:44] <Cork> murosai_: well you can create a new object and only include the keys you want
[05:04:49] <Cork> but ya, that is looping
[05:05:14] <Cork> murosai_: so ya, there isn't much alternatives
[05:18:22] <sqlnoob> I'm trying to get whole HTML DOM (the dom generated by javascript) using jquery on read() but it just gives me the original HTML with javascript. Any hint on how this can be achieved?
[05:20:43] <anli_> If I take a jquery element and use .parent() on it, and then .parent() on that etc, would I end up in either obj.is("body") or obj == null ?
[05:23:02] <CrowX-> what is wrong in this syntax? http://pastebin.com/FjgFuyq4
[05:23:37] <CrowX-> the code inside the json never runs, even though the function that contains it is executed
[05:24:06] <Cork> CrowX-: you prob want to check hasOwnProperty in line 3
[05:24:14] <Cork> other then that it should work
[05:24:34] <CrowX-> what does hasownproperty do?
[05:24:48] <Cork> CrowX-: it checks so i isn't something from the prototype
[05:25:04] <CrowX-> Cork, even when I put an alert('test'); it doesn't show
[05:25:57] <Cork> js> var a = [1,2,3,4,5]; Array.prototype.woops = 1; var j = []; for(i in a) { j.push(i); }; print(JSON.stringify(j));
[05:26:07] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:26:24] <Cork> huh?
[05:26:45] <Cork> b-ot: are you smoking again?
[05:26:45] <b-ot> Cork: yes.
[05:26:50] <Cork> thought so
[05:27:26] <Cork> CrowX-: also you don't want to use for(in) on arrays
[05:27:59] <Cork> CrowX-: about the alert part, sounds like the connection fails
[05:28:07] <Cork> CrowX-: check so the json is valid to start with
[05:30:32] <CrowX-> got it!
[05:30:58] <CrowX-> the php file that was supposed to return the json structure was giving a "deprecated" error. I turned off that type of errors and it works fine now.
[05:30:59] <CrowX-> thanks
[05:31:26] <Cork> CrowX-: lol, thx for the insite in the the cause
[05:31:33] <Cork> CrowX-: and yw
[05:31:50] <Zac12> hi there, I am struggling with importing jquery ui for the autocomplete function
[05:32:12] <Zac12> import is working completely fine locally but as soon as i take it live onto remote, it doesn't always work, only about 30% of the time
[05:32:27] <Bloomberg> hi
[05:32:33] <Zac12> https://dpaste.de/LvwR
[05:32:39] <Bloomberg> someone know how can I go to Bootstrap channel?
[05:32:44] <Zac12> there's where i'm loading it and i don't see what the problem could be?
[05:32:50] <Cork> Zac12: are you loading the js at the bottom of the page or in head?
[05:38:24] <evangeline_> hi
[05:38:46] <evangeline_> I'm using this to detect the click on a button in a table: $('.mytable').on('click', 'button', function() { ... }
[05:38:48] <Zac12> Cork, thanks! was my error. I was putting it outside the head... how stupid
[05:39:07] <evangeline_> but what if I add another button to the table row ... how to detect if the first/second button was clicked upon?
[05:39:31] <Cork> evangeline_: add a class to the button and use it instead of 'button'
[05:44:45] <evangeline_> Cork, ok I did this: <td><button class="button_scan">Start</button></td>
[05:44:51] <inv3nt0r> Back in a few...
[05:44:56] <le_gars> Hi, anyone experienced .load() outputting chunked responses from the server in the browser?
[05:44:59] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I go to Bootstrap channel?
[05:45:51] <evangeline_> Cork, but the: $('.mytable').on('click', 'button_scan', function() { ... } is not called
[05:46:24] <Cork> evangeline_: button_scan would be an elemnt
[05:46:27] <Cork> *element
[05:46:41] <Cork> evangeline_: you use a dot for classes (and # for ids)
[05:48:34] <evangeline_> Cork, works, thank you very much
[06:37:30] <fabioportieri> what were the reason for 2 jquery branches, 2.x and 1.x, again?
[06:38:03] <Jattenalle> fabioportieri, i was told 2.x drops support for older browsers
[06:38:08] <Jattenalle> and that's the only difference
[06:38:19] <fabioportieri> older browser = ?
[06:38:31] <Jattenalle> < IE9 ?
[06:38:59] <fabioportieri> ah, reading from the site, thanks
[06:45:14] <drej> ps, this was the caution tape at jQueryTO this past weekend:
[06:45:15] <drej> https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/1970548_10153931351905037_2103324115_n.jpg
[07:03:13] <jop008> Anyone an idea why the select boxes on an ipad act differnetly then on a desktop. In the toggle column ialogue I created it because of problems with toggle column (known bug solved in 1.4) http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/72/
[07:05:47] <jop008> Can some one check on an android?
[07:05:48] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/72/
[07:05:55] <jop008> toggle the column
[07:09:27] <ankurk_> drej: this is so awesome!
[07:12:39] <decx> i'm not a class, i'm an indiviual, # all the way
[07:13:22] <ankurk_> decx is right actually
[07:13:36] <ankurk_> they should have used an id
[07:14:44] <kegster> how can i disable a css active state with js? not disable, but turn it off
[07:14:53] <kegster> $(.foo).blur() isnt working
[07:15:41] <jop008> Any tips on the behaviour on check boxes in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/72/ On desktop test is fine
[07:15:46] <ankurk_> kegster: .css('active', ' ') ?
[07:16:07] <kegster> well, you have a:active a:visited a:hover a, etc
[07:16:25] <kegster> when you click something on mobile, it becomes :active -- i want to de-focus that button on click and blur isnt working
[07:16:55] <ankurk_> kegster: you would do this I guess, $('a').css(
[07:17:02] <Cork> kegster: you would have to move the focus
[07:17:02] <Cork> something like $(document).focus() should work
[07:17:02] <Cork> and blur() doesn't work as you need to move the focus for that to be meaningful
[07:17:07] <ankurk_> *.css('active', ' ')
[07:17:23] <Cork> ankurk_: active isn't a css value
[07:17:33] <Cork> its a psudo selector
[07:17:44] <kegster> document.focus() didnt work :\
[07:17:54] <kegster> maybe document trigger click
[07:18:03] <ankurk_> hmm, I was wrong then, thanks Cork
[07:18:21] <kegster> damn didnt work either
[07:18:22] <kegster> hmm
[07:18:54] <hlvwrk> Hey guys. Any chance you know of a JS method to clear browser authentication in chrome?
[07:19:34] <Cork> hlvwrk: as in basic auth you mean?
[07:19:43] <hlvwrk> yes.
[07:19:59] <ankurk_> kegster: try this, $(a).removeClass('hover');
[07:20:00] <Cork> hlvwrk: you call an url and the server sends a unauthorized response
[07:20:18] <Cork> ankurk_: not a class psudo ^^'
[07:21:06] <Cork> hlvwrk: basically there is no "nice" way to logout from basica auth, and it means it sucks to use for anything bug intranet solutions
[07:21:09] <ankurk_> Cork damn wrong again
[07:21:24] <ankurk_> kegster: this should help you, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436629/how-do-i-remove-hover
[07:21:27] <Cork> bug==but
[07:22:31] <hlvwrk> cork, i have it working perfectly in firefox/ie
[07:22:34] <hlvwrk> chrome = no go
[07:22:50] <Cork> hlvwrk: how do you logout in firefox?
[07:22:56] <Cork> i know ie has a command for it
[07:23:03] <Cork> but last i checked they are the only one
[07:23:41] <drej> ankurk_ yeah definitely should have used an ID but still :)
[07:24:03] <ankurk_> drej: yeah their idea is awesome though :D
[07:26:15] <decx> maybe it's not you as in me, but you as in you people, then class makes perfect sense
[07:26:28] <andrew9183> anyone got a good tag plugin?
[07:27:22] <Cork> decx, drej: its you as in <you> so it is an element == entity = person
[07:27:29] <Cork> so i would say it fits
[07:27:45] <Cork> better then id as that would make it one unique person on the planet
[07:28:01] * drej takes notes
[07:28:15] <drej> i mean really what they should ahve done is $('.people').stop();
[07:28:42] <Cork> drej: so if a person does't thing they belong to that class they can pass?
[07:28:57] <drej> well unless that person is not people
[07:28:59] <Cork> drej: while if they are of the element type <you> they match :)
[07:29:02] <drej> i think it stands to reason
[07:29:03] <drej> :)
[07:29:07] <drej> i mean, cats are allowed
[07:29:35] <Cork> drej: well class is more targeted for "a class of persons"
[07:29:42] <decx> $('i').walk(function(){ if (this.z >= $('.rope')[0].z ) { $(this).stop() } }) is a bit long
[07:29:48] <Cork> as a person is an entity not a class
[07:29:52] <drej> lol decx
[07:30:07] <Cork> decx: good one
[07:30:12] <prodigitalSon> is it ok to ask questions about qunit here ?
[07:30:19] <prodigitalSon> or is there a channel for that ?
[07:30:21] <drej> i feel like we've sufficiently beaten the dead horse
[07:30:36] <Cork> prodigitalSon: sure, you might have to wait for an answer though
[07:30:47] <Cork> as i don't know how many there are here that knows the plugin
[07:30:56] <Cork> drej: true :)
[07:32:07] <prodigitalSon> I want to test some code that uses window.location
[07:32:47] <prodigitalSon> and I don't know how to do it, as I have no window.location on my tests
[07:32:57] <prodigitalSon> (automated tests with grunt)
[07:33:33] <Cork> prodigitalSon: you could create a window = { location };
[07:33:49] <Cork> prodigitalSon: and after the code runs test if window.location is what it should be
[07:34:04] <Cork> prodigitalSon: never used the lib so only throwing ideas
[07:34:22] <prodigitalSon> could work
[07:35:02] <prodigitalSon> I'll give it a shot, thanks
[07:39:13] <shilon> anyone works with masonry?
[07:40:00] <drej> shilon i have a few times
[07:41:08] <andrew9183> masonry is so hot
[07:41:20] <drej> that's so 2008
[07:41:43] <shilon> i'm using it with angular js and I don't know why when the items are loading it makes a stupid bump before fixing on the right position
[07:42:36] <andrew9183> i think i had the same issue a while ago, where the boxes were being populated via ajax
[07:43:15] <andrew9183> and i had hide the div then hook into the masonry callback to show the div when it was complete
[07:43:22] <shilon> i think masonry div is doubling the height and after it loads it fixes it
[07:43:25] <andrew9183> yeah
[07:43:28] <andrew9183> that's it
[07:43:51] <shilon> I need to hide masonry too?
[07:44:08] <andrew9183> i'm confident there is a better way
[07:59:07] <pagioss> is there something that can be done in jscript but not in jquery?
[07:59:55] <Cork> pagioss: i'm assuming you mean js or javascript and not jscript
[08:00:06] <pagioss> javascript yes Corey
[08:00:11] <Cork> pagioss: jquery is just a framework, you are still writing javascript
[08:00:28] <script_> alert("Hello");  :)
[08:00:30] <Cork> pagioss: jscript is microsofts reimplemntation of javascript
[08:00:39] <Cork> with document.all and attachEvent and so on
[08:00:57] <pagioss> does jquery work over jscript?
[08:01:47] <Cork> pagioss: the original point of jquery was to build a compatibility layer handling the differences between jscript and the others implementation
[08:02:13] <Cork> pagioss: ms has since moved closer to the the standards so it is much less of a difference now days
[08:02:47] <pagioss> so the abstraction jquery adds is not as efficient as previously
[08:03:07] <Cork> pagioss: no, it isn't needed mostly
[08:03:28] <pagioss> but jquery adds different other stuff too, makes code easier to write no?
[08:03:29] <Cork> pagioss: now it is more just a way to write the repetitive code in a simpler manner
[08:03:31] <v0id3d> Good morning all
[08:03:39] <pagioss> with the different fucntions it introduces and the effects etc
[08:03:48] <Cork> pagioss: yes, that is it's primary reason for existing now days
[08:04:35] <pagioss> jquery mobile is another framework on top of jquery? even more ghighlevel heh
[08:04:45] <Cork> pagioss: yes
[08:04:49] <Cork> and jquery ui
[08:04:56] <pagioss> heard bad reviews about it
[08:05:20] <Cork> which one?
[08:05:33] <pagioss> mobile
[08:05:56] <Cork> it is way to js centric for me
[08:06:01] <pagioss> for the users developping like 3d games and stuff in the browser what framework is mostly used?
[08:06:15] <Cork> if you build a site in jqm the page won't load without js
[08:06:16] <Cork> so it isn't for me
[08:06:32] <fabioportieri> for 3d, i guess webgl
[08:06:33] <Cork> pagioss: they don't use dom mostly
[08:06:37] <Cork> ya
[08:06:52] <pagioss> webgl works in the browser?
[08:06:54] <Cork> 3d games is usually asm.js + webgl
[08:07:03] <Cork> pagioss: webgl only exist in the browser
[08:07:09] <pagioss> ok
[08:07:21] <Cork> it's opencl otherwise
[08:07:30] <Cork> opengl is a super set of it
[08:07:45] <pagioss> the games are not bad at all using these tech
[08:07:57] <pagioss> can you use the gpu and stuff too?
[08:08:11] <Cork> pagioss: the hole point of webgl is that it uses the gpu...
[08:08:17] <pagioss> hehe ok
[08:08:37] <Cork> not sure if there is any software backends now days
[08:08:50] <Cork> but at the beginning it didn't load at all without hw support
[08:08:50] <pagioss> with integrating that with node.js on server side you have a networked game
[08:10:38] <drej> Cork the only thing that cant access gpu still (basically) is javascript
[08:10:52] <drej> css3 utilizes gpu, even flash has gpu acceleration
[08:11:33] <pagioss> webgl is an independant frameowkr or is it part of js?
[08:11:39] <Cork> drej: well webgl and canvas drawing is gpu and... arguably as much js as you can get
[08:11:52] <Cork> pagioss: webgl works option of the <canvas> element
[08:12:04] <Cork> pagioss: and it is native, no framework
[08:12:05] <drej> right you can use javascript, but javascript itself cannot access the gpu
[08:12:12] <drej> it does it because its webgl and canvas
[08:12:13] <drej> but yeah
[08:12:24] <Cork> drej: js isn't graphical, so how would it use gl?
[08:12:29] <Cork> *gpu
[08:12:40] <pagioss> so mainly js uses the webgl which in turn uses the gpu
[08:13:00] <Cork> drej: you can do animations with js on a canvas and it would be gpu accelerated
[08:13:00] <drej> Cork traditional jquery 1.* tweens and such
[08:13:04] <miCSu> Hi! I'm trying to use jQuery Form Plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/form) to upload files with php handler but for some reason the $_FILES variable isn't assigned with chrome
[08:13:05] <drej> well yeah
[08:13:14] <drej> anyway, just based on spec is all im talking about
[08:13:25] <Cork> drej: well you arn't doing graphical things there, you just change values in a data structure
[08:13:39] <Cork> drej: and then wait for the browser to draw it on the screen
[08:13:56] <Cork> drej: and if the browser can't predict that you plan to do that change
[08:13:59] <miCSu> actually when I tried with test page, it worked fine but after copying it to use in different location it stopped working
[08:14:03] <Cork> it can't gpu accelerate it
[08:14:30] <Cork> drej: and as js is a black box to the browser, it can't predict what happens
[08:14:33] <clime> Hey, is it possible to somehow reset jquery-ui style that gets applied to content of dialog?
[08:14:34] <drej> Cork there are instances where, for example, math processing would be benefit from gpu acceleration
[08:14:43] <Cork> drej: and cause of that you can't gpu accelerate these things
[08:14:48] <drej> i know
[08:14:55] <Cork> drej: and you can accelerate those
[08:15:07] <drej> yeah if you throw it into webcl
[08:15:08] <Cork> drej: i've seen projects do it through canvas and webgj
[08:15:09] <drej> sure
[08:15:16] <drej> but not natively w/ js
[08:15:22] <drej> anyway; we're both saying the same thing
[08:15:27] <Cork> drej: as native as you can hope for
[08:16:00] <Cork> drej: unless you mean the system libs should be pulled into js and the page should have full control of you gpu :)
[08:16:08] <Cork> and... no, just no XD
[08:16:16] <drej> im not saying it needs to change
[08:16:22] <drej> i was just saying that it wont and will never do that
[08:16:34] <drej> :)
[08:16:46] <Cork> drej: and i argue that just cause you need to go through a dom element doesn't mean it isn't accessable to js
[08:16:56] <clime> I load ajax content into jquery-ui dialog and the ui styles messes up with mine.
[08:17:04] <Cork> drej: dom animations isn't but there's a good reason for that
[08:17:07] <drej> being accessible and being native are two different things
[08:17:12] <drej> i agree
[08:17:16] <Cork> drej: but canvas that is another matter
[08:17:29] <Cork> canvas is mostly js, same with webgl
[08:17:50] <Cork> it is close to as js based as opencl is c/c++ based
[08:18:27] <Cork> drej: well when they do math on the gpu they use the opencl lib for something it wasn't meant for
[08:18:37] <Cork> it is basically the same kind of hack they don on webgl
[08:18:47] <Cork> *they do on
[08:18:53] <drej> yup
[08:25:24] <v0id3d> when writing a plugin and i want to pass optins to the plugin i define defaults do i need to define the options?
[08:27:44] <drej> yup
[08:27:49] <drej> so that you can define defaults
[08:28:02] <v0id3d> so all items should have defaults?
[08:28:25] <drej> if they're dependencies, yes, if they're options that wont break if they're not defined
[08:28:26] <drej> then no need
[08:28:51] <drej> i mean generally its good practice to define them anyway, even if the default value is null
[08:30:21] <v0id3d> and when i call it ("#test").myplugin(test: 'red');
[08:30:46] <v0id3d> just curious if i am getting this rite haha
[08:32:38] <v0id3d> and when i call it ("#test").myplugin({test: 'red'});
[08:32:40] <v0id3d> i mean
[08:37:50] <Genesis_> http://pastebin.com/ZivBRREJ
[08:38:05] <Genesis_> I am new to jquery, was wondering if anyone could help me with the above issue
[08:38:10] <drej> whats the issue?
[08:38:21] <Genesis_> well, what I am trying to do is read from a .txt file
[08:38:42] <Genesis_> the make it so on each new line on the .txt file, a "hui" is added
[08:38:56] <Genesis_> then the result of that is inserted into .insert
[08:39:19] <drej> okay, and where is it failing?
[08:39:28] <Genesis_> its not outputting anything on the page.
[08:39:35] <drej> Genesis_ in fact it would probably be beneficial for you to take some time to setup a test case on jsfiddle
[08:39:42] <drej> did you check your inspector console to see if there are any errors/
[08:39:42] <Genesis_> console in chrome says: Uncaught TypeError: Object This is an example of a .txt file has no method 'append'
[08:40:08] <drej> are you serving it on a webserver or just opening the file locally
[08:40:13] <Genesis_> file locally
[08:40:29] <drej> run it on a webserver
[08:40:31] <drej> local or otherwise
[08:40:46] <Genesis_> i'm running it locally using visual studio's web server.
[08:41:01] <Genesis_> if I, outside of the for loop do something like: $(".insert").html(content);
[08:41:11] <Genesis_> it will print it out, no issues, except its al on 1 line.
[08:41:39] <Genesis_> var completed = content[i].append("hui");
[08:41:43] <Genesis_> this seems to be the trouble line
[08:41:57] <cool_boy> Hello I am trying to fadeIn an image using jquery. can someone tell me how to select image with id ="1" in jquery ? here is html http://jsfiddle.net/SKfPE/1/
[08:42:33] <decx> 1 isnt valid
[08:43:10] <cool_boy> decx: 1 is not valid id? what means?
[08:43:18] <v0id3d> ('#<id>') <----- where <id> is your id
[08:43:29] <Amart41> can anyone answer a question for me about using jquery to make an onchange event for a select dropdown
[08:43:30] <drej> Genesis_ any way you can setup a working test case with your problem so we can see it
[08:43:37] <Genesis_> sure, hold on
[08:43:38] <drej> its hard to tell what the problem is without seeing all parts of the puzzle
[08:43:40] <decx> you can't start with a number
[08:43:42] <drej> there's nothing necessarily wrong with your js
[08:44:01] <decx> don't question the reason, as it doesn't make any sense
[08:44:13] <cool_boy> v0id3d: so I tried this $('#1').fadeIn(3000); but image is not showing up
[08:44:29] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: don't use numbers for your ID
[08:44:39] <Genesis_> drej: But the issue is, its reading from a local file
[08:44:43] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/8DEQk/
[08:44:49] <drej> Genesis_ upload the file somwhere
[08:44:54] <Genesis_> but anyways, this is the code, without the local file
[08:45:02] <Genesis_> the .txt file just has just text in it for testing
[08:45:10] <drej> right but we need to see the type of text
[08:45:11] <Genesis_> plaintext
[08:45:13] <drej> or what youre trying to do with it
[08:45:15] <drej> what the data is
[08:45:23] <drej> i mean, youre saying its pulling in the data fine, but having a hard time adjusting it
[08:45:26] <Genesis_> http://pastebin.com/JeBHHbue
[08:45:28] <drej> is it a json object?is it just text
[08:45:31] <Genesis_> this is the .txt file
[08:45:57] <drej> i see
[08:46:00] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: well changed id to "one" and tried $('#one').fadeIn(3000); but not working
[08:46:04] <Genesis_> yeah, very simple.
[08:46:15] <Genesis_> but do you get what I am trying to do drej?
[08:46:25] <Genesis_> I am basically trying to print the content of the .txt file
[08:46:29] <Genesis_> preserving its lines.
[08:46:41] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: create a js fiddle. are you getting errors in console? is the script waiting for the DOM / #one to actually be there?
[08:47:00] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: oh i see your fiddle one sec
[08:47:14] <bengalo> Amart41 whats the prob?
[08:47:26] <drej> Genesis_ yeah i get it
[08:47:29] <drej> sorry im also getting sidetracked
[08:47:33] <drej> if anyone else wants to jump in, go ahead
[08:47:38] <Genesis_> thanks
[08:47:38] <drej> otherwise give me af ew mins
[08:47:46] <Genesis_> I just don't get why the append won't work
[08:47:49] <tbmiller> morning all, quick question even tho I'm using the jquery .load() function to  specific request a section of a page, all content and images from the whole external page are still loading on the requested page any thoughts on this?
[08:48:01] <Genesis_> I am new in jquery/javascript sorry if I am making a mess.
[08:48:03] <decx> Genesis_ because content[i] isnt a jquery object
[08:48:11] <Genesis_> it isn't?
[08:48:11] <decx> it's just an array
[08:48:20] <Genesis_> OH so I am trying to append to an array
[08:48:35] <Genesis_> I thought content[i] would extract the individual string within the array?
[08:48:39] <decx> yeah you just split a long string into an array
[08:48:42] <bengalo> tbmiller it will always retrieve the whole page
[08:48:53] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/SKfPE/2/ @ cool_boy.  learn your selectors, and you should be hiding images that you want to 'fade in'
[08:48:57] <decx> it does, but that's still no jquery object
[08:49:06] <bengalo> you can tell it what to load into the div or whatever by supplying the element to load in the url
[08:49:07] <Amart41> hey Bengalo I have this code: $("#user_profile_id").change(function() {  within a $(document).ready(function() { and it works fine but for some reason when I change pages it stops working
[08:49:08] <tbmiller> how can I only receive the area specified?
[08:49:11] <Genesis_> decx: So how would I fix it? Is there an alternative to append?
[08:49:42] <bengalo> you probably want to take a look at event delegation
[08:49:44] <tbmiller> I know and it's requesting and showing what I want in the markup, but I don't want requests for the rest of the content until I do another action
[08:50:02] <Amart41> the .change function either submits the form or redirects to a new page, the form is on multiple pages, the problem is when I navigate to another page now nothing happens on chnage anymore
[08:50:09] <Amart41> yeah tried that too
[08:50:14] <Amart41> delegation I mean
[08:50:17] <Amart41> same problem
[08:50:24] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: I have tried this but is not working. image is not showing up
[08:50:35] <decx> Genesis_ content[i] = 'stuf + content[i]
[08:50:43] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: except my fiddle is showing it working.
[08:50:44] <decx> 'stuff'
[08:50:47] <Amart41> also tried $(window).load
[08:50:47] <bengalo> Amart41 it has to be an element on the page that doesnt get reloaded
[08:51:02] <Genesis_> decx: What is "stuff"?
[08:51:08] <decx> hui
[08:51:17] <Genesis_> I see
[08:51:18] <decx> the text you want to add to that array element
[08:51:33] <Genesis_> so I don't need to create a new var?
[08:51:41] <Amart41> not sure exactly what you mean by that can you elaborate, what part can't be reloaded
[08:51:46] <bengalo> well, you probably want something like $(document).on('change', '#user_profile_id', function() { what to do });
[08:51:55] <decx> probably not
[08:52:04] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 wait so you have a listener, and then you're going to a different page?
[08:52:05] <bengalo> where document is a little too "high" in hierarchy
[08:52:06] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[08:52:25] <Genesis_> decx: content = "</ br>" + content[i];?
[08:52:44] <Genesis_> or would this rewrite content?
[08:53:26] <bengalo> Amart41, if you bind the event to some div and you reload/refresh where that elements get renewed somewhat, the bound event is gone
[08:53:27] <Genesis_> completed = "</ br>" + content[i];
[08:53:27] <Genesis_>  $(".insert").html(completed); is simply printing the final result
[08:53:33] <bengalo> that is, not bound to anything anymore
[08:53:34] <Genesis_> I think I need an append of some sort?
[08:53:53] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: yes it is working on fiddle but i am not able to make it work on local
[08:54:09] <bengalo> thats why u need some parent-element of that #user_profile_id to "watch" for that event to happen
[08:54:20] <Amart41> yeah the jquery code appears on multiple pages as does the form, one of the selections redirects to a 'new profile' page rather than selecting one of the profiles, the code still works fine when it does the redirect,I can still select profiles once redirected to the 'new profile' page. The problem comes when I use the site navigation to go anywhere else where the form appears it no longer submits the form or redirects at all.
[08:54:36] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: so note the differences. the inline style.  the change of the ID to 'one' on the element *and* the selector.
[08:54:52] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: is it not must to set {display:none} to element which were are going to fadeIn or fadeOut?
[08:55:01] <bengalo> Amart41 can u bin what u have?
[08:55:13] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: no, use inline.
[08:55:27] <NoiseEee> afaik
[08:56:11] <decx> Genesis_ why don't you say you just want to add brs to a plain text source?
[08:56:16] <Amart41> yeah sorry I'm somewhat new to this how can I bin it for you
[08:56:31] <Genesis_> decx: so you mean the .txt file have </br>?
[08:56:37] <Genesis_> Because I need the javascript to do it all for me
[08:56:48] <bengalo> tbmiller you will always the whole page you requested but with $('#yourwindow').load('url form') it will only fill your #yourwindow with the contents of the form element from that page
[08:57:03] <bengalo> !bin
[08:57:07] <TheJHNZ> o/
[08:57:15] <decx> no i mean plaintextstring.replace('\n','<br>')
[08:57:24] <bengalo> kk maybe not, jsfiddle e.g.
[08:57:34] <Amart41> Hey sorry man the boss is sending me out of the office on an errand I'll see if I can get back on in a few minutes
[08:57:49] <Genesis_> decx: could work
[08:57:57] <tbmiller> I know this now, but is there a way I can only load AND request the content that is specified in that designated section?
[08:58:18] <bengalo> dont think so, since its a normal request to the web server
[08:58:29] <bengalo> you can tell the server to only send parts if the request is ajax or something
[08:58:33] <bengalo> but thats server side
[08:58:43] <tbmiller> hmm, I see.
[08:58:49] <Genesis_> docx: For some reason its only adding a br to the first line.
[08:59:43] <Genesis_> decx: http://pastebin.com/Lj53i2ZT
[09:00:13] <tbmiller> thanks bengalo!
[09:00:27] <bengalo> yw ;) good luck
[09:00:42] <Genesis_> got it!
[09:00:50] <decx> Genesis_ you need the g modifier
[09:00:52] <Genesis_> data.replace(/\n/g, "<br />"); is the solution decx: thank you
[09:00:58] <Genesis_> thanks :)
[09:01:15] <Genesis_> decx: let me ask you, the next thing I want to do is just have a single function
[09:01:21] <Genesis_> that will do this for all files
[09:01:32] <Genesis_> so you see how I am inserting this into ".insert"?
[09:01:54] <Genesis_> is there a way to set a variable that is passed to the javascript code from the html so it knows where to insert it?
[09:02:08] <Genesis_> and also, so it knows what .txt file to read?
[09:02:16] <LordThumper> Hi, is anyone else getting "Web forgery" / "Phishing" warnings on jsfiddle?
[09:02:25] <LordThumper> Both on Chrome and Firefox
[09:02:53] <bengalo> nope
[09:02:58] <LordThumper> bengalo: Press Run
[09:02:58] <decx> do you have a bunch of insert divs that all need to get their respective txts and add brs?
[09:03:01] <duch_kazatel> LordThumper on what pages?
[09:03:06] <LordThumper> jsfiddle.net
[09:03:11] <LordThumper> I just press Run and pop

[09:03:41] <LordThumper> sure
[09:04:01] <duch_kazatel> wait are you behind a firewall?

[09:05:41] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: youre going to a different address
[09:05:43] <LordThumper> That is Chrome, let me screenshot Firefox
[09:05:50] <Genesis_> is there a way in javascript to set a value within the html, and then have the javascript search for the value, when it finds it it will also keep track of the class it found it within
[09:05:54] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/ is fine
[09:05:54] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a firewall problem then.
[09:05:59] <LordThumper> Noisee: dns poisoning?
[09:06:09] <NoiseEee>  fiddle.jshell.net is bad
[09:06:23] <LordThumper> Noisee: Yes, mine is fine too, when I press Run the error pops up
[09:06:23] <NoiseEee> dunno, i don't recall that address
[09:06:28] <NoiseEee> oh

[09:08:37] <LordThumper> duch_kazatel: Does that give you phishing popup?
[09:08:51] <bengalo> it does here
[09:08:55] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:09:12] <LordThumper> Out jsfiddle.net works?
[09:09:13] <duch_kazatel> firefox and chrome both use google's phishing info, iirc.
[09:09:19] <LordThumper> (Press you press Run)
[09:09:23] <LordThumper> But*
[09:09:25] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: Got the reason behind why image is not showing up here but did not get the logic. I would try to explain the case please tell me logic beind it. there are two .js files named "scripts.js" and "slider.js" . I gave reference to "script.js" and in next line to "slider.js" In this case image did not show up. just switched both lines and it started work properly. could you please tell...
[09:09:27] <cool_boy> ...me reason behind it? in slider.js I did fadeIn() in other other I wrote function to check required fields.
[09:09:28] <LordThumper> When you press*
[09:09:28] <bengalo> remember this happening to php.net not too long ago, cuz google fucked something up imo
[09:09:30] <LordThumper> I can't type today
[09:09:34] <duch_kazatel> yeah, jsfiddle.net works for me.
[09:10:04] <NoiseEee> i get phishing error when trying to run a script from jsfiddle too
[09:10:13] <decx> jsbin employed some black hat seo guys ^^
[09:10:17] <axilaris> hi...can some one help abit... if i remove a row, can i get details of the row like the id value ? http://jsfiddle.net/x6c2K/1/
[09:10:24] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: i guess one file depends on the other?
[09:10:48] <LordThumper> Well their servers might be compromised, or its a false positive
[09:11:05] <LordThumper> Either way it seems unusable atm
[09:11:37] <LordThumper> bengalo: iirc php.net was hosting some malware
[09:12:21] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: I dont think please have a look on both files http://pastebin.com/SSh26njt
[09:12:40] <bengalo> might be yeah, just saw php.net claming google fucked sth up but no clue really ;)
[09:13:34] <NoiseEee> cool_boy: i don't think there's much sense in both files having a document.ready
[09:13:50] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:14:10] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: this might be a reason.
[09:14:16] <Amart41> $(document).ready(function() {
[09:14:17] <Amart41> 	$("#user_profile_id").change(function() {
[09:14:17] <Amart41> 		if($(this).val() == "new-profile") {
[09:14:18] <Amart41> 			window.location.href = "/client_data/profiles/new"
[09:14:21] <Amart41> 		}
[09:14:22] <Amart41> 		else {
[09:14:24] <Amart41> 		    $('.edit_user').submit();
[09:14:27] <Amart41> 		}
[09:14:29] <Amart41> 	});
[09:14:30] <Amart41> });
[09:15:01] <Amart41> ok bengalo this is my jquery https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b64115376cdf798e4fb9
[09:15:49] <bengalo> well, did u read up on event delegation docs?
[09:16:12] <Amart41> yeah I did actually try delegation at one point but I had the exact same issue
[09:16:19] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: the one from which I remove document.ready stops its functionality. I think it is must what you say?
[09:16:40] <Amart41> maybe I didn't do it right let me see if I can pull up the code I used for that hang on
[09:17:25] <xMopxShell> does anyone know of a plugin or lib that, if I have a <ul> of image thumbnails, it will paginate them into pages with a set number?
[09:17:35] <xMopxShell> bonus points for it being repsonsive too
[09:18:28] <cool_boy> NoiseEee: the one from which I remove document.ready stops its functionality. I think it is must what you say?
[09:25:20] <Amart41> ok bengalo this is what I had for delegation https://gist.github.com/anonymous/74e280707437e2c6fa78 and this is the html https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c191582326e9b90faab2
[09:25:26] <Amart41> still the same issue
[09:25:49] <bengalo> delegate is deprecated ;)
[09:25:54] <duch_kazatel> use .on.
[09:26:06] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('event', 'target', function(){});
[09:26:07] <Amart41> ahhh ok hang on
[09:26:10] <bengalo> god
[09:26:36] <bengalo> duch_kazatel has a copy/paste list for common probs
[09:26:42] <bengalo> or 400 apm
[09:26:43] <duch_kazatel> actually...
[09:26:47] <duch_kazatel> :)  i type fast.
[09:26:51] <bengalo> :>
[09:26:58] <duch_kazatel> we get the event delegation question in here so often.
[09:27:27] <duch_kazatel> i've been tempted to write a series of fiddles to demonstrate delegation, scoping, and callbacks.
[09:27:27] <decx> not a bad idea
[09:27:35] <decx> alias common stuff
[09:28:13] <duch_kazatel> i should just back out a bunch of features from my irc bot and stuff it full of stuff like that.
[09:28:14] <decx> parent 'target', function(){});
[09:28:21] <decx> now i can just write /on
[09:28:23] <decx> :>
[09:28:28] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:28:45] <decx> oh i guess i have to quote that ^^
[09:31:23] <Amart41> ok so it's still the same :(
[09:31:50] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind parent is something that needs to exist at time of binding - something that exists on pageload is safe.
[09:32:26] <Amart41> yeah it's all static all these elements exist on page load
[09:33:45] <Amart41> any chance this is an issue with something else, the app is RoR
[09:34:05] <roxor972> Hi all, I got a problem on the website I work on : http://testprojects.my.phpcloud.com/book/ when we click on the button it does not slide enough to display the title "Mon Profil". Can someone help me please ?
[09:34:11] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using, Amart41?
[09:36:01] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 oh this is simple - you're targeting the wrong thing.
[09:36:20] <Amart41> it's 1.11.0 for the jquery version
[09:36:35] <Amart41> what am I not targeting right?
[09:36:54] <duch_kazatel> share your javascript using .on()
[09:37:53] <Amart41> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ecfd0943322568f73809
[09:38:02] <duch_kazatel> also: select#user_profile_id is unnecessarily and actually inefficient.
[09:38:07] <duch_kazatel> *unnecessary
[09:38:25] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7Bd5K/1/
[09:38:26] <duch_kazatel> that works.
[09:40:35] <Amart41> yeah that's what I've got, maybe I wasn't clear but it works on all pages until I navigate to them with the site nav, if I refresh the page after I've hit it it works fine just not initially
[09:41:33] <duch_kazatel> are you replacing the container div?
[09:41:37] <duch_kazatel> the parent one?
[09:42:20] <jammsen> how do i change the link value if its a hash like #tab1
[09:42:30] <duch_kazatel> "the link value"
[09:42:35] <duch_kazatel> what is "the link value"?
[09:42:58] <jammsen> http://pastebin.com/GhkhZd4t
[09:43:00] <Amart41> yeah all the html I sent you, and that you had in the fiddle is there on all pages including the parent div
[09:43:18] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 that doesn't answer my question.  are you replacing the contents of the pages?
[09:43:28] <duch_kazatel> jammsen woah. that is... slow.
[09:43:41] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: i want to use more tabs from bootstrap, but for this i have to change the value from #tab1  to #tab1-randomstringhere
[09:43:56] <jammsen> i want this to be dynamic
[09:43:58] <duch_kazatel> $(panel).find('a[href^=#t]').each(function() { <- that is going to be pretty bad.
[09:44:04] <duch_kazatel> add a class and target that instead.
[09:44:19] <duch_kazatel> either way, you want to edit the href attribute.
[09:44:26] <decx> if panel is contained it aint so bad
[09:44:28] <duch_kazatel> hash is not an attributed.
[09:44:34] <duch_kazatel> *attribute
[09:44:49] <jammsen> isnt it the value of href?
[09:45:11] <duch_kazatel> hash?  no.  .attr('hash') is trying to access an attribute called hash.
[09:45:15] <duch_kazatel> which isn't a thing.
[09:46:13] <jammsen> then .attr('href' right?
[09:46:49] <duch_kazatel> .attr('href') will get the href attribute.
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> then you'll parse that - you could do something like $(selector').attr('href').split('#')[1] <- there's your hash.
[09:47:19] <decx> attr only works for the first element so you have to put it in a loop. and so the advantage of not using the attribute selector gets smaller
[09:47:39] <Amart41> not that I know of, the only html that changes between these pages is the title and some of the content. The form is at the top of the page and part of the template for the pages so it's the same across all of them
[09:48:09] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 just because the html is the same doesn't mean it's not getting removed and resinserted.
[09:48:24] <Seus> so would there be any immediate reasons why jquery.animate() would run with so much graphics lag? All I'm doing is having a div slide in and out from the right hand side of the screen. I've even removed all elements inside of the div that slides out. Had 0 effect on the performance
[09:49:46] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/P4JbAQBQ like that?
[09:49:56] <decx> animate has to repaint every few ms to update the inline css value, use transition and animation in css for performance Seus
[09:50:09] <duch_kazatel> jammsen can you fiddle it instead?
[09:50:21] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: i can try
[09:50:24] <jammsen> !fiddle
[09:50:25] <Seus> ah, so do it with CSS rather than JS/Jquery is basically what it comes down to?
[09:50:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:50:47] <decx> it's not as black in white as that, but in most cases transition will be more performant
[09:50:55] <Seus> hmm ok
[09:51:05] <Amart41> ok interesting so if it is being removed and then reloaded the jquery function may not be bound to it still? Or am I off?
[09:51:12] <Seus> well it runs like crap now, so the current way of doing it, is not the best solution
[09:51:34] <decx> if you use translate3d you can even leverage hardware support
[09:51:34] <Seus> i tried using this jquery animate-enhanced and that made everything run very well...
[09:51:40] <Amart41> first time using RoR and just starting to set up an app so I admit I don;t know exactly what it's doing when I navigate between pages
[09:51:42] <Seus> its just that it broke how a lot of the click handlers triggered
[09:52:03] <Seus> things that were bound to a single div, you'd click anywhere on the screen and it would trigger the click event
[09:53:40] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 exactly.
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> if you remove the node, the event binding goes with it.
[09:54:59] <Amart41> hmmm so any way I can adjust the jquery to deal with that or do I have to look into the behavior of the app?
[09:55:01] <Seus> ah, i remember my first time with RoR...def. a few wtf moments...especially with the asset pipeline and pre-caching, and the differences between dev and prod environments
[09:55:10] <duch_kazatel> Amart41 do it the smart way and look into the behavior.
[09:55:18] <Amart41> ok cool thanks man
[09:55:30] <duch_kazatel> if you're replacing the entire contents of the page, you're probably doing something wrong
[09:55:35] <duch_kazatel> also: look into event delegation.
[09:59:35] <cool_boy> $('#slider > img#one').fadeIn(300); in this line what does the sign ' > ' between 'slider' and 'img' do? If I remove this sign nothing changes.
[09:59:49] <decx> > is for a direct child
[09:59:53] <duch_kazatel> it's unnecessary, but that's direct child.
[09:59:53] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/NX6Ze/ there you go
[09:59:54] <decx> same as in css
[10:00:01] <cool_boy> decx: okay thanks !
[10:00:04] <duch_kazatel> especially for img#one, which should be just #one
[10:00:25] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: when you look at the links its #t1 instead of #t1-window123456
[10:01:08] <duch_kazatel> so what are you trying to do here, exactly?
[10:01:15] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: so if you add multiple layers and then click on a tab header, the others will switch too
[10:01:40] <decx> i see the draggable on scrolled pages is still bugged
[10:02:17] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: shortly said, individual tabbing not just on click more tabs change
[10:02:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:02:49] <duch_kazatel> i am way lost.
[10:02:59] <duch_kazatel> the original question was about getting the hash fragment out of a URL.
[10:05:18] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: go on the fiddle press 4 times on click me, when you then tab on any of these panels, ALL will change, i just want the content one the clicked one to change, got me?
[10:06:26] <ingodid> i am having difficluty dynamicly setting tooltip content
[10:06:45] <ingodid> i am faitly sure it is a varible-scope issue, but i am unsure how to pass the scope
[10:06:46] <ingodid> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=xpwKELh6
[10:07:02] <shapr> Greetings, I have some simple jquery validations questions. I'm using the validation library from bassistance.de, and it sort of works, but still allows the form to submit when some fields are invalid. I asked Google and read some on StackOverflow, but I can't figure out what's wrong.
[10:07:26] <Cork> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/eE5Rc/4/ interesting effect if you look at it in chrome :)
[10:07:44] <duch_kazatel> jammsen then you're doing your event binding all weird.
[10:07:52] <shapr> Is there some way I can figure out exactly why jqueryvalidation is letting the form be submitted anyway?
[10:08:18] <duch_kazatel> Corey oooh.
[10:08:23] <duch_kazatel> err, Cork
[10:08:41] <Cork> duch_kazatel: chrome has problems with vertical-align :)
[10:08:43] <taleeb_> in my dialog box text is displayed in horizontal form ?how to display it in vertical form?
[10:08:48] <duch_kazatel> jammsen also: i'm not having that problem.
[10:09:08] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: i want to create them from template and the default value is #t1 to #t4 i just want to change them into #t1-window321321 to #t4-window321321
[10:09:38] <duch_kazatel> jammsen aaah, if I open two, the second controls the first.  you should look into how to run event bindings a little differently.  your current strategy won't be very maintainable imo.
[10:09:46] <duch_kazatel> Cork apparently.  that's funky.
[10:10:10] <Cork> duch_kazatel: made me go... WTF... when i first found the bug
[10:10:23] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: what do i try to find in google?
[10:10:31] <jammsen> tell me a keyword pls
[10:10:43] <duch_kazatel> jammsen are you familiar with event delegation?
[10:10:50] <duch_kazatel> that'd be a great place to start.
[10:11:15] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: but im not defining the events, bootstrap does
[10:11:26] <duch_kazatel> where did I say "defining events"?
[10:11:30] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:11:42] <duch_kazatel> you need to learn about event binding, bubbling, and delegation.
[10:12:08] <Corey> duch_kazatel: Oh my.
[10:12:08] <bengalo> im telling you, the copy/paste sheet is the new thing =)
[10:12:41] <duch_kazatel> what you're doing now does a great job of tying your markup to your javascript in a very awkward way.  if you use delegated listeners instead, you'll do that a lot less.
[10:12:42] <Cork> Corey: heh hi, first time i've seen you; i'm your alter ego; just so you know XD
[10:13:00] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha sorry Corey.  tab autocomplete fail.
[10:13:12] <Cork> duch_kazatel: your not alone
[10:13:21] <Cork> it happens at least a few times a day XD
[10:13:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah i know. still sucks!
[10:13:39] <Cork> i do it too
[10:13:53] <Cork> in a channel with 800+ users it is to be expected
[10:14:19] <duch_kazatel> there should be an option to limit the list to anybody whose spoken in the last x minutes or something.
[10:14:29] <Corey> Cork: So it would seem.
[10:14:49] <ingodid> how does one pass varibles within ui init settings? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=xpwKELh6
[10:15:21] <decx> append it as data on your element
[10:15:35] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: you mean link $(document).on('mouseenter','#some' and that stuff?
[10:15:37] <Cork> ingodid: you define a global variable like line 1
[10:15:51] <duch_kazatel> jammsen yeah - learn how to harness that really effectively.
[10:15:52] <Cork> ingodid: works as long as the functions are called after each other
[10:15:57] <duch_kazatel> and don't bind to document.
[10:16:01] <decx> also, one is imgurl, the other is imgUrl
[10:16:09] <decx> vars are case sensitive
[10:16:23] <duch_kazatel> also: if this $.browser abasement has taught me anything, it's that I really hate browser detection, plugins, and jqueryui.
[10:16:23] <Cork> ah
[10:16:27] <Cork> good catch
[10:16:29] <Cork> missed that
[10:16:30] <ingodid> Cork: doesn't seem to work, imgurl is undefined in "content"
[10:16:40] <Cork> ingodid: decx's found the problem
[10:16:52] <ingodid> well .... my eyes :(
[10:16:58] <decx> i doubt that will make the scope problem go away
[10:17:00] <Cork> ingodid: mgurl =  origin.attr('data-largeimg'); => mgUrl =  origin.attr('data-largeimg');
[10:17:16] <decx> instead of imgurl = blah, you can do $(this).data('imgurl',blah)
[10:17:17] <duch_kazatel> origin.data('largeimg');
[10:17:18] <Cork> decx: it will actually
[10:17:20] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: i dont get it, what helps me event delegation if i just have to change the value of the href of the a? i dont get the context, sorry :(
[10:17:30] <decx> and then you can grabs this data imgurl anywhere
[10:17:49] <Cork> decx: he defines the imgUrl on line 1
[10:17:55] <Cork> so it is just a typo
[10:17:57] <decx> oh right
[10:18:06] <duch_kazatel> jammsen you're approaching it all wrong.  you should be binding listeners to the individual tab groups or whatever they are and go from ther.e
[10:18:29] <duch_kazatel> jammsen the idea is that you create a scope of sorts for the events to operate inside of.
[10:18:47] <duch_kazatel> or create a sort of "master" handler and scope your handling to those tab groups.
[10:18:47] <ingodid> decx: matching case fixed the error...i have to stop with the camelcase
[10:18:53] <ingodid> too open to typos
[10:18:58] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: isnt that like rewrite all of js function for tabs in bootstrap?
[10:18:59] <decx> thats why i only use lowercase
[10:19:00] <duch_kazatel> ingodid camelCase is actually a good thing.
[10:19:06] <Cork> ingodid: or pick a better font :)
[10:19:07] <duch_kazatel> jammsen huh?
[10:19:25] <duch_kazatel> jammsen i'm saying that your current strategy is unmaintainable.
[10:19:33] <Cork> camel case or low dash is ok with me
[10:19:36] <duch_kazatel> unless bootstrap has some magic foo i'm aware of.
[10:19:46] <decx> ingodid how does that cope when you have multiple .atooltips ?
[10:19:55] <Cork> as long as it is the same cross the site
[10:20:14] <Cork> decx: not at all :)
[10:20:23] <decx> i know ;)
[10:20:24] <tonythomas> cand $.proxy() be replaced with  $.bind()  to get same functionality ?
[10:20:28] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: if the link is #t1-abc boostrap looks for a div with id="t1-abc" and switches this on
[10:20:38] <Cork> tonythomas: no
[10:20:40] <decx> just nudging him in the right direction here Cork
[10:20:51] <duch_kazatel> jammsen also: you can't repeat an id on a page.
[10:20:55] <Cork> tonythomas: .bind is for events not func.bind()
[10:20:59] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: but when i have 4 windows with 4 tabs, the of your select all id="t1" and changes it everywhere
[10:21:02] <duch_kazatel> jammsen you're missing the forest here :)
[10:21:28] <tonythomas> Cork:  in the reverse way. I have an event this.$element.on( 'keypress', $.proxy( this.keyup, this ) )
[10:21:37] <duch_kazatel> also: you can subscribe to bootstrap events, jammsen
[10:21:47] <jammsen> duch_kazatel: no thats my point exaclty, thats why i want to change the id and link has value from #t1 or id="t1" to something t1-randomstring
[10:21:48] <duch_kazatel> but again, you can't repeat IDs.
[10:22:03] <tonythomas> If I give this.$element.on( 'keypress', $.bind( this.keyup, this ) ) , will it be the same result ?
[10:22:17] <Cork> tonythomas: why don't you just pass this as a variable to on instead?
[10:22:23] <Cork> tonythomas: no
[10:22:29] <ingodid> decx: hehe -- doesn't
[10:22:55] <ingodid> but now that I know it's not scope, i can push the images into an array, and access them that way
[10:22:59] <tonythomas> Cork:  this as a variable ? like $.bind( this.keyup),this ?
[10:23:00] <Cork> tonythomas: $.bind( this.keyup, this ) will send $ to on with keyup and this bound to it
[10:23:01] <delboy1978uk> any of you guys use swipeview? http://cubiq.org/swipeview trying to get my image to resize when you rotate the phone
[10:23:05] <decx> that's why i suggested the data way ingodid
[10:23:14] <Cork> tonythomas: jquery bind isn't the same as $.proxy
[10:23:23] <ingodid> decx: implimenting now
[10:23:31] <duch_kazatel> also: bind was deprecated.
[10:23:35] <Cork> tonythomas: also don't use keypress  events, they arn't supported
[10:23:38] <Cork> duch_kazatel: no it isn't
[10:23:56] <Cork> superseded as in prefered by the doc writers
[10:24:04] <Cork> but not in anyway or form deprecated
[10:24:08] <duch_kazatel> hah, i thought it had a deprecation notice.
[10:24:09] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[10:24:33] <Cork> tonythomas: don't use keypress btw
[10:24:36] <duch_kazatel> aaah, but bind does map to .on()
[10:24:46] <tonythomas> Cork:  ok. so if I was to use bind, how should the same code be re factored ?
[10:24:54] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ya, there is little reason to remove them
[10:25:13] <duch_kazatel> we push people to always use .on() and to update shit as they come accross it.
[10:25:16] <decx> like that crazy delegate shim where it just switches the args ^^
[10:25:23] <Cork> tonythomas: first use keydown not keypress
[10:25:34] <tonythomas> Cork:  done.
[10:25:39] <Cork> tonythomas: keypress isn't supported cross browser, and fires at the same time as keypress
[10:25:47] <Cork> opps
[10:25:50] <Cork> time as keydown
[10:26:01] <tonythomas> ok
[10:26:17] <decx> wasnt incorrect per se
[10:26:25] <Cork> tonythomas: and to do the same thing as $.proxy naively
[10:26:40] <Cork> you do this.$element.on( 'keypress', this.keyup.bind(this))
[10:27:04] <Cork> tonythomas: though that code will crash in older ie
[10:27:41] <Cork> and by older ie i mean <ie9
[10:28:05] <tonythomas> Cork:  thanks a lot. I will have to use something like this.eventSupported ?
[10:28:26] <Cork> tonythomas: or just use $.proxy()
[10:28:43] <Cork> tonythomas: or you could pass this as a variable to on instead
[10:29:53] <Cork> tonythomas: this.$element.on( 'keydown', { me: this }, this.keyup)
[10:29:58] <tonythomas> Cork: this is passed as a variable to on, when using bind right ?
[10:30:00] <tonythomas> ok
[10:30:03] <tonythomas> looks good
[10:30:07] <Cork> tonythomas: and then you can reference the class with event.data.me
[10:30:18] <tonythomas> Cork:  thanks
[10:43:23] <ingodid> decx: apparently you can just return content in the "functionInit" function
[10:43:27] <ingodid> no need to pass the varible
[10:43:59] <ingodid> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Bb8RsYeQ
[10:53:34] <Cork> ingodid: nice, it did make me flinch what you did before :)
[10:54:17] <CrowX-> when this gets executed "$.getJSON("load_bombs.php", function(results): is the variable "results" holding the json string, or an array?
[10:55:11] <duch_kazatel> results is holding the returned JSON
[10:55:35] <Cork> uh no it holds the parsed data
[10:55:58] <Cork> meaning what it is depends on what was in the json
[10:57:01] <Cork> CrowX-: so if the data you got back was a json array, results will be an array
[10:57:10] <CrowX-> thanks
[11:04:22] <hcker2000> I have a div with some inline code inside of it. It looks like my code inside of it is being run before the dom has fully resolved as when I do $('#myDivId') its returning nothing. Any ideas how to handle this?
[11:05:56] <duch_kazatel> don't put your code inline.
[11:05:58] <duch_kazatel> put it in a file.
[11:06:06] <hcker2000> its part of an ajax call
[11:06:15] <duch_kazatel> not gonna change my suggestion.
[11:06:24] <duch_kazatel> in fact, that strengthens my suggestion.
[11:06:38] <duch_kazatel> if you are dynamically generating javascript, you are in for pain.
[11:06:38] <hcker2000> ok lets say i move it to another file
[11:06:51] <hcker2000> how do I watch for a div with a specific id to be added to the dom?
[11:07:10] <hcker2000> unfortunittly I dont have access to the code thats adding the div
[11:07:20] <hcker2000> or I would just do it there
[11:07:20] <duch_kazatel> you put your handling within a .done() callback handler.
[11:07:25] <duch_kazatel> learn about global ajax events.
[11:07:28] <duch_kazatel> they are perfect for this.
[11:07:54] <hcker2000> can you do that without access to the original code making the ajax call?
[11:07:54] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[11:08:13] <duch_kazatel> read the docs :)
[11:08:27] <hcker2000> ahh i see how there doing that
[11:08:39] <hcker2000> that could be an option as well
[11:08:56] <hcker2000> but i still want to know how to do it this way as well
[11:09:06] <duch_kazatel> don't.
[11:09:19] <hcker2000> dont learn? sorry I cant do that
[11:09:19] <duch_kazatel> your other method is a terrble idea and will need hacks to work.
[11:09:30] <hcker2000> i understand that
[11:09:36] <hcker2000> I still want to know the hacks
[11:09:48] <hcker2000> it helps to understand why its a bad idea
[11:09:59] <duch_kazatel> because you're dynamically generating javascript after the page has loaded.
[11:10:03] <duch_kazatel> enjoy troubleshooting.
[11:10:14] <duch_kazatel> you're also mixing your separations of concern.
[11:11:23] <hcker2000> yea I suppose thats enough reason not to do it. though so far firebug did a good job debugging it
[11:11:45] <duch_kazatel> right, and then imagine as the application grows.
[11:11:53] <duch_kazatel> and other people get dropped into your codebase.
[11:12:05] <duch_kazatel> keep your javascript separate.
[11:24:33] <ankurk_> Just a just general question, what tips you people would give to get really good at JavaScript?
[11:25:31] <Xoro> How do make a whole div draggable by having a div inside it work like a title bar? $( ".titlebar" ).draggable({
[11:25:31] <Xoro>   drag: ($'.wholediv')); maybe?
[11:25:33] <teasercss> hey guys any idea how to make a body element with a bg image clickable ?
[11:25:45] <teasercss> http://codepen.io/LeaFlashDev/pen/HfsCF/
[11:32:04] <decx> your body is 0 pixels high
[11:32:19] <NoiseEee> twss
[11:32:54] <drej> OH SNAP
[11:32:58] <drej> NoiseEee you didnt go to jqueryto ?
[11:33:44] <NoiseEee> i didnt
[11:33:46] <NoiseEee> you?
[11:35:05] <drej> yep
[11:35:12] <drej> although i got drunk during the lunch break on sunday
[11:35:21] <drej> and went home and fetal positioned on the couch
[11:35:26] <drej> apparently im too old to drink 3 pints for breakfast
[11:35:58] <NoiseEee> yeah i dont know many people who can
[11:38:05] <duch_kazatel> you mean Saturdays?
[11:38:09] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[11:38:45] <jesseatschool> too old, not irish enough, one or the other
[11:40:57] <ankurk_> People go get drunk after 3 pints, and I thought I am the only who gets tipsy after 1
[11:43:17] <NoiseEee> i have the liquor tolerance of a very slim asian woman
[11:43:19] <drej> well it didnt help that it was the first meal i had in the day
[11:43:21] <drej> was the pints
[11:43:36] <drej> im normally okay, but i basically went home and cried after that for like 10 hours
[11:43:56] <v0id3d> when poeple talk about the size of your plugin are they refering the the file size?
[11:44:12] <NoiseEee> presumably, v0id3d
[11:44:14] <drej> YOU BET THEY ARE BIG BOY
[11:44:24] <decx> no, it's a euphemism
[11:44:36] <v0id3d> got to love it
[11:44:38] <v0id3d> thanks
[11:47:17] <sunbeam> Some of my divs have classes called col_2/4 (yes i know this is bad but outputted by cms) I'd like to change these into 12th's so 2/4 will be col6
[11:47:20] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[11:48:29] <sunbeam> col_2/4 has to get the class col6
[11:48:40] <sunbeam> Any ideas how I can best do this?
[11:51:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:51:39] <duch_kazatel> how do I get 6 out of 2/4?
[11:52:21] <duch_kazatel> what CMS are you using so I know to avoid it?
[11:53:07] <NoiseEee> add 'em
[11:53:33] <duch_kazatel> (shhhh i was waiting for them to explain it)
[11:53:52] <sunbeam> it adds div class="col_2/4"
[11:53:59] <decx> i'd just rewrite the css rules in whatever grid system you're trying to use
[11:54:16] <sunbeam> .col_2/4 is this valid?
[11:54:23] <duch_kazatel> yeah this is a terrible javascript problem.
[11:54:26] <sunbeam> I mean valid css
[11:59:17] <jesseatschool> http://codepen.io/ManyouRisms/pen/dmnwG/
[11:59:55] <jesseatschool> I'm trying to fill the value of the "combination is" box with the combo property of the selected list item ( which would hopefully apply to a created object)
[12:00:04] <jesseatschool> but i'm not sure how to get started with my retrieveStudent()
[12:00:34] <ankurk_> jesseatschool: <script> tags in JS area?
[12:00:53] <ankurk_> <script> tags are only allowed in HTML part
[12:01:28] <jesseatschool> oops, thank you
[12:01:36] <duch_kazatel> even better - "tags are only allowed in HTML"
[12:01:55] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: that's even better yeah
[12:04:00] <jesseatschool> excellent, I will fix that, although it the scripts seem to be working okay, i'm just not sure how to go about retrieving the object properties and displaying them in a particular textbox in a function
[12:04:19] <duch_kazatel> fix up the code first and then we'll help.
[12:04:49] <furyFoo> Is there an event that happens when all activity on the page stops ? As in when there is nothing more to download.
[12:04:49] <furyFoo> I have a function taking care of a Firefox bug but if it triggers before the images fully load it drives Chrome nuts
[12:04:57] <duch_kazatel> accessing object properties is easy - either use myObject.prop or myObject['prop']
[12:05:13] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo document ready should be good.
[12:05:16] <duch_kazatel> unless the document isn't valid.
[12:05:29] <duch_kazatel> in which case you can use the load event.
[12:05:51] <furyFoo> Already doing that , works great unless you have a crappy connection or use Chrome
[12:05:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:06:00] <soahccc> Can anyone recommend a lightweight carousel plugin? I know jCarousel but I consider this a bit bloated, tinycarousel is just a pile of not working mess
[12:06:13] <duch_kazatel> i like jqmodal myself, soahccc\
[12:06:21] <jesseatschool> http://codepen.io/ManyouRisms/pen/dmnwG/   <-- i think that is what you mean? putting the script after the body, before closing html?
[12:06:27] <furyFoo> Basically i run into a bug that sometimes stops div height from being sey
[12:06:29] <furyFoo> *set
[12:06:31] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool huh?  no.
[12:06:34] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool that's invalid.
[12:06:50] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: can you use the modal as carousel? o.O
[12:06:52] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool the script tag must be before </body>
[12:07:01] <duch_kazatel> soahccc sorry, misread your question.  ignore me!
[12:07:04] <furyFoo> So i have a function checking for that and running a page refresh - the bug fix.
[12:07:50] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool http://codepen.io/anon/pen/tDxaH - this is a place to start.
[12:07:52] <furyFoo> Works fine on decent connections but if the images are still loading or Chrome is used it just cycles way to many times
[12:08:07] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo right - you want the load event.
[12:08:15] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('load', function(){});
[12:08:23] <duch_kazatel> that will wait for everything to finish loading.
[12:08:35] <jesseatschool> okay great. wasn't sure how to deal with placing the function scripts and global var scripts and what not, thanks
[12:08:36] <soahccc> I'll try looper, looks good :)
[12:08:54] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool you should also wrap all that in a document ready.
[12:10:34] <furyFoo> duch - thanks , i'll test it right now
[12:11:21] <jesseatschool> http://codepen.io/ManyouRisms/pen/rGdDv
[12:11:24] <jesseatschool> okie dokey
[12:11:58] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool that is not correct :(
[12:12:47] <duch_kazatel> $(function(){ /* your code here */ });
[12:12:49] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[12:13:39] <jesseatschool> i thought that was equivilent to $(document).ready(function() {}
[12:13:41] <jesseatschool> my bad
[12:13:53] <kadoban> is setting text of an <input> with .val() safe against XSS injection, or do i have to sanitize input first?
[12:14:10] <duch_kazatel> jesseatschool what i just did is, what you did was not.
[12:14:18] <duch_kazatel> kadoban sanitizer.
[12:14:21] <duch_kazatel> *sanitize
[12:14:22] <duch_kazatel> always
[12:14:28] <duch_kazatel> backend, too.
[12:14:29] <duch_kazatel> and frontent.
[12:14:47] <duch_kazatel> *frontend
[12:15:04] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: is there an easy way to do that built in somewhere, or do i have to roll my own?
[12:15:33] <kadoban> my input isn't terribly hard to sanitize, but still feels like there already would exist a solution
[12:15:37] <ankurk_> kadoban: as duch_kazatel said, always do server side validation
[12:15:45] <duch_kazatel> are you sanitizing server-side?
[12:15:51] <ankurk_> you have to write your own unfortunately
[12:15:53] <duch_kazatel> client-side validation should only be done as a convenience.
[12:16:02] <duch_kazatel> server-side should always be done.  period.
[12:16:30] <kadoban> the form inputs aren't being actually used for that, they're only used from javascript, if that makes sense
[12:16:37] <furyFoo> duch - just tried this http://pastebin.com/vA5Q6VcW and Chrome is still going nuts.
[12:16:37] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:16:50] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo please use jsfiddle instead of pastebin
[12:16:51] <furyFoo> At least on WAMP
[12:17:00] <duch_kazatel> kadoban are the inputs on the page?
[12:17:04] <kadoban> there's no server-side sanitizing to do, the form is never submitted, or even if it was it wouldn't do anything
[12:17:07] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: yes
[12:17:14] <duch_kazatel> kadoban then what are the inputs for?
[12:17:34] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: to be processed by other JS
[12:17:44] <duch_kazatel> what is the "other js" doing?
[12:17:57] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo your question isn't making any sense at this point.  is your document valid?
[12:18:16] <furyFoo> The code is in 2.0
[12:18:21] <furyFoo> Fully refactored
[12:18:24] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo wat
[12:18:26] <furyFoo> So yes it is
[12:18:33] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo "the code is in 2.0" what?
[12:18:38] <duch_kazatel> and your code makes no sense.
[12:18:44] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: it's rather hard to explain in detail, but mostly being processed (bunch of math in a library) and eventually displayed in other ways...
[12:18:48] <duch_kazatel> if (isHeightSet == 0) {location.reload()}; - this is a terrible idea.
[12:19:02] <duch_kazatel> you're forcing the entire page to reload.
[12:19:27] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you have other problems you need to address - forcing a browser reload is a terrible idea.
[12:19:47] <furyFoo> I looked for something to reload just the specific divs affected but didn't came across anything viable.
[12:20:01] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo and your HTML passes validation?
[12:20:06] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: it's bitcoin related, if that helps, haha. it's like... http://brainwallet.org/ only not at all. so, there's no server side to validate with...so was that my only worry with setting via .val(), or do i have to sanitize anyway?
[12:20:13] <furyFoo> Yes it does.
[12:20:13] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo what "browser bug" are you working through?
[12:20:55] <duch_kazatel> kadoban if there's any way data ever would get sent to the server?
[12:21:23] <kadoban> duch_kazatel: no. if it was, it'd be ignored completely
[12:21:53] <duch_kazatel> i'd triple-check that, but there are a ton of jquery validation plugins out there.
[12:22:31] <furyFoo> The height set by JS for responsive divs doesn't show in the browser until reload. On WAMP i get it on clean cache Firefox , on the live server it affects Opera 12.16 and IE 10 - Firefox & Chrome are fine there.
[12:22:31] <furyFoo> I read up some bug reports and it used to be a Chrome bug as well but it got patched.
[12:23:09] <jesseatschool> weeeeell.. i was able to get the name to add at the bottom before moving the scripts around but it's not working in the pen now. i should go back to fiddle lol
[12:23:34] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo have a more complete example in a jsfiddle?
[12:23:37] <kadoban> still not sure on the answer to my question though :/ will $('input').val($userInput) be a problem on its face? ...maybe i should just sanitize anyway
[12:24:00] <duch_kazatel> kadoban basically, always validate when people are concerned.
[12:25:11] <furyFoo> I can give you the live page - http://tinyurl.com/pd38hmx
[12:25:42] <furyFoo> Look at it with IE 10 or older IE and you'll see the bug just in the Websites section
[12:25:54] <furyFoo> Squashed divs with no height set
[12:26:15] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo half the reason we ask for a fiddle is to see you try to replicate the bug outside of the environment you've created.  sometimes that reveals the solution.
[12:26:56] <furyFoo> If this was a easy to replicate bug I would be more than happy to do the JS fidle
[12:27:19] <furyFoo> I'll give it a try
[12:27:36] <drej> NoiseEee do i have you on the twatters ?
[12:27:39] <duch_kazatel> let me look at your javascript.
[12:27:53] <NoiseEee> drej: dunno, @SilverRocket
[12:28:06] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo ... where is your javascript?
[12:28:28] <duch_kazatel> wait wtf is rocketscript?
[12:28:37] <srikat> Need help in fixing "TypeError: loc is null". URL: http://dev.brianlis.com/prompter/
[12:28:48] <drej> NoiseEee oh i am, excellent
[12:28:59] <ankurk_> drej: twatter lol
[12:29:17] <furyFoo> http://pastebin.com/MhBZ8YQJ
[12:29:20] <furyFoo> Here
[12:29:24] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo your code is bizarre.
[12:29:28] <soahccc> oh well looper is also broken :( I think I just use the at least working jcarousel
[12:29:32] <furyFoo> My CDN makes things fuzzy sometimes
[12:29:50] <furyFoo> It's what Cloudflare does
[12:30:05] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo you are aware that your "array" isn't an array?
[12:30:17] <furyFoo> Yes I know
[12:30:26] <ankurk_> drej: what's your twatter id btw?
[12:30:32] <furyFoo> It just helps me not go insane with array names
[12:30:39] <furyFoo> *var names
[12:30:40] <duch_kazatel> except that it's not an array.
[12:30:47] <drej> ankurk_ dr_drej
[12:31:04] <furyFoo> I had the same code with just pure vars , it made no difference
[12:31:23] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo you're trying to interact with regular object/properties as if they're arrays.
[12:31:24] <furyFoo> I turned off the CDN so you should see no more rocketscript & stuff
[12:31:26] <ankurk_> Looks like I tweet a lot
[12:31:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't tweet as much as I used to.
[12:31:40] <duch_kazatel> not sure why.
[12:32:00] <ankurk_> I stopped too but I have around 15000 tweets right now
[12:32:23] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo either way, the way you're doing all of this is really strange.  wait for the window load event and don't reload the entire page.
[12:32:25] <furyFoo> duch_kazatel	- again had the same code with none of the array stuff when I first built it , the bug was still there
[12:32:34] <drej> yeah i dont tweet that much
[12:32:46] <duch_kazatel> furyFoo i'm just giving you general advice on how to not write crap code..
[12:33:13] <ankurk_> but I don't why I like twitter than facebook
[12:33:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to wrap all your code in a document ready, not just the part where you call your functiuons, btw.
[12:33:34] <duch_kazatel> *functions
[12:34:26] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[12:34:37] <furyFoo> This isn't crap code - it's proto OO
[12:34:53] <furyFoo> As for wrapping that whole code  ... that's an idea
[12:40:40] <v0id3d> is there a way to find out what kind of element you have in a selector?
[12:43:36] <decx> v0id3d .prop('tagName')
[12:48:48] <v0id3d> ok so if i do .prop('#test'); it and i have <input id="test"> it will return input?
[12:49:16] <duch_lunch> $('#test').prop('tagName');
[12:49:30] <v0id3d> gotcha
[12:50:54] <rentermaker> Hey guys, I'm running into a weird issue where jquery makes a request to https://d2yx7mld78izup.cloudfront.net/static_assets/arrow.png, but returns 403 forbidden, anyone ever run into this?
[12:51:53] <duch_lunch> rentermaker nope.  fiddle?
[12:53:41] <rentermaker> duch_lunch: I also forgot to specify, this is happening when I use dataTables jquery plugin or any other table based plugin for jquery
[12:53:53] <duch_lunch> still a nope.
[12:53:54] <duch_lunch> fiddle?
[12:54:01] <rentermaker> sure, one second
[12:55:54] <R2D345> Hello guys, I was wondering whether I could ask a newcomer question?
[12:56:00] <duch_lunch> !ask @ R2D345
[12:56:01] <b-ot> R2D345: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:56:37] <rentermaker> duch_lunch: Well I'll be damned, it works fine in jsfiddle :/
[12:56:42] <R2D345> Ahh, righto
[12:56:56] <duch_lunch> rentermaker that means it's something in your code :)
[12:57:07] <v0id3d> silly bot
[12:57:10] <rentermaker> But I just ported over my code into jsfiddle
[12:57:18] <duch_kazatel> rentermaker right, so it's something else.
[12:57:34] <duch_kazatel> jquery and most plugins don't just fire off image request like that.  why do you think they are?
[12:57:39] <R2D345> I was wondering, I'm very new to jQuery and I've been trying to make a drop down list, I was wondering what you guys usually do/use (assuming that it's a very popular thing to do). I couldn't find any in jqueryui surprisingly.
[12:57:46] <R2D345> drop down menu*
[12:57:56] <duch_kazatel> R2D345 why not use a <select>
[12:58:19] <R2D345> For an <ul> <li>?
[12:58:25] <v0id3d> duch_kazatel, why use a select? ill add to the newb question
[12:58:29] <duch_kazatel> R2D345 then why are you using a select?
[12:58:45] <duch_kazatel> rather, why use a dropdown at all?
[12:58:58] <duch_kazatel> unless you want something customizable.
[12:59:00] <v0id3d> dropdowns == pwnsause
[12:59:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[12:59:20] <R2D345> It's something I've been asked to do for my friend
[12:59:21] <duch_kazatel> that's about as close as you'll get with autocomplete.
[12:59:27] <duch_kazatel> *with jqueryui.
[12:59:28] <R2D345> He wants the menu on a small site to be a drop down
[12:59:30] <duch_kazatel> i cannot type today.
[12:59:41] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, it's pretty easy to build your own./
[12:59:44] <R2D345> Ahh
[13:00:08] <v0id3d> so duch_kazatel you normally make drop downs out of selects?
[13:00:18] <duch_kazatel> selects ARE dropdowns.
[13:00:24] <v0id3d> well yes i know that
[13:00:33] <duch_kazatel> then what's the question?
[13:00:48] <v0id3d> hahaha for a nav menu tho wouldnt that be a pain
[13:01:03] <R2D345> I think I may have chosen the wrong word to describe what I intend to do
[13:01:06] <R2D345> It's a drop down nav as voided said
[13:01:14] <duch_kazatel> ah, those are stupid simple
[13:01:24] <R2D345> Not for me ^^
[13:01:39] <v0id3d> sorry duch_kazatel thats where my questions were comming from hahaha
[13:01:47] <duch_kazatel> https://jqueryui.com/menu/
[13:01:51] <R2D345> I just kinda assumed there'd be something premade at jqueryui
[13:01:56] <v0id3d> thought you were going to give me like a jewel lol
[13:02:01] <duch_kazatel> : Leaving)
[13:02:01] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:18:13:00:54] * vlad_starkov (~vlad_star@77.41.82.191) has joined #j
[13:02:03] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[13:02:09] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/
[13:02:11] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[13:02:43] <duch_kazatel> or you can learn about event binding and adding/removing classes on your own.
[13:02:46] <R2D345> I saw that one, only problem is that it's.. sideways, but perhaps there are some options I can choose?
[13:03:11] <duch_kazatel> R2D345 did you look at the options on the API page?
[13:03:22] <v0id3d> ok duch_kazatel so if i want to make a plugin with mandatory options how would i do something like that?
[13:03:23] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:18:13:02:26] * fatalhalt (~fatalhalt@64.245.224.162) ha
[13:03:24] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[13:03:27] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#option-position
[13:03:42] <v0id3d> so you couldnt just .myplugin(); on it
[13:04:10] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those things that are so simple that while there may be a plugin for it, I see no reason to use one.
[13:04:58] <R2D345> Thanks duch, that's most likely what I was looking for. I have one more question, I hope you don't mind
[13:05:03] <R2D345> I know there's a themepicker on jqueryui
[13:05:36] <R2D345> Is that the only way to change the appearance of the component or is writing your own CSS valid as well?
[13:05:53] <R2D345> I'm asking because I assume if I cut the CSS file from the plugin everything would get messy
[13:06:04] <duch_kazatel> not sure i understand the question.  how else would you change the look of it?
[13:06:23] <duch_kazatel> often you'd override the default styles in your own stylesheet, loaded after the other stuff.
[13:06:35] <duch_kazatel> this is why I don't use jQueryUI.
[13:07:05] <R2D345> Ahh, you prefer to make your own?
[13:07:10] <v0id3d> o ok
[13:07:17] <v0id3d> so its just best to make the defaults then
[13:07:18] <duch_kazatel> i write most of my own stuff.
[13:07:27] <duch_kazatel> because jqueryui is just so.. heavy.
[13:07:48] <duch_kazatel> and if all you need is a nav, including the whole core lib feels overkill.
[13:08:00] <duch_kazatel> i all ready have jquery - that handles most of my pain.
[13:08:10] <R2D345> Ahh
[13:08:25] <duch_kazatel> jqueryui does a lot of magic for me, some of it I don't want.
[13:08:43] <R2D345> I read somewhere that you could select which part of the jquery UI lib you could download
[13:08:48] <duch_kazatel> yep, you can.
[13:08:49] <R2D345> Not sure whether that solves much
[13:08:54] <duch_kazatel> but you still have to download the core.
[13:09:00] <R2D345> Oh right
[13:09:19] <duch_kazatel> plus i hate the default styling in jqueryui :)
[13:09:53] <R2D345> I can definitely agree with that, but is overriding it all that hard?
[13:10:07] <duch_kazatel> why waste time overriding?
[13:10:23] <duch_kazatel> that's just extra crap for the browser to work through.  I'd prefer to deliver the thing I actually want.
[13:10:43] <R2D345> I see your point, I think I'd do the same if I had any presentable jquery skills
[13:11:26] <duch_kazatel> the only way to get there is to push yourself to hand-roll shit.  then you'll learn when it makes sense to use plugins vs. writing your own.
[13:11:43] <slicky> Does anyone have a full page calendar script that they've used with some success that they could recommend?
[13:12:12] <slicky> I was using fullcalendar but it does not handle a large volume of events/day.
[13:12:46] <R2D345> Would love to do that some day soon, university takes up the majority of my day for now
[13:12:52] <R2D345> Have you been developing for long duch?
[13:13:32] <duch_kazatel> a while, yeah.
[13:17:09] <v0id3d> hahah i started with jquery last week and i made my first plugin on friday
[13:17:22] <v0id3d> and working on my second one now
[13:17:28] <v0id3d> its not hard to grasp
[13:17:35] <v0id3d> especially with duch around lol
[13:17:45] <duch_kazatel> hah
[13:17:49] <duch_kazatel> nah i'm just a sounding board.
[13:17:58] <slicky> Anyone use CLNDR with any success?
[13:18:39] <duch_kazatel> i actually haven't written any plugins yet.
[13:18:42] <duch_kazatel> i might some day
[13:19:10] <duch_kazatel> well, that's a lie.  i've written one for internal company use.
[13:19:20] <offlim> does anyone know how to run .after() 1 time?
[13:19:37] <duch_kazatel> offlim huh?
[13:19:45] <duch_kazatel> after one time what?
[13:19:49] <duch_kazatel> (share code in a fiddle)
[13:21:05] <Cork> offlim: i think .eq(0).after() might be what your looking for
[13:21:13] <Cork> only guessing though
[13:21:54] <slicky> .after( function(index) )
[13:22:02] <slicky> is an alternate way
[13:23:13] <Cork> offlim: i think the source of the problem is that you run .after on an array of more then one element
[13:23:38] <Cork> and as after adds after each one of them you get multiple additions
[13:25:29] <offlim> i just figured it out another way. thanks for your help
[13:25:43] <duch_kazatel> what was your solution?
[13:25:47] <duch_kazatel> sharing is caring!
[13:28:44] <zumba_addict> is iframe supported in html5?
[13:28:59] <NoiseEee> yes
[13:29:11] <duch_kazatel> has a different syntax though, iirc.
[13:29:32] <zumba_addict> thanks NoiseEee. colleague here said it's not
[13:29:37] <zumba_addict> i'll correct him
[13:29:49] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
[13:29:52] <duch_kazatel> there was talk of deprecating it.
[13:29:58] <NoiseEee> frames are gone
[13:30:01] <NoiseEee> iframes alive
[13:30:10] <duch_kazatel> I'd heard the same about iframes.
[13:31:02] <gordian> guys i have a script that replaces several elements on a page using $.html() and i'm trying to make sure the containing element's height animates smoothly, but not sure where to begin. ideally i'd like to use css3 transitions for the height property but i'm not having any success. any help would be greatly appreciated.
[13:32:36] <zumba_addict> thanks duch_kazatel
[13:33:03] <zumba_addict> how can I tell from the link that it's support in HTML5?
[13:33:23] <duch_kazatel> Specifications
[13:33:35] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Specifications
[13:34:19] <offlim> duch_kazatel: i add div1 inside of div2 and then just used a if statement saying if div2 exist inside of div2 don't add it again
[13:34:28] <zumba_addict> thanks
[13:34:34] <duch_kazatel> offlim well then there you go.
[13:35:31] <gordian> here's a fiddle of what i'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/silb3r/2k658/
[13:36:14] <duch_kazatel> gordian replace the text, not the html.
[13:36:48] <gordian> duch_kazatel: that doesn't work :-/
[13:37:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2k658/1/
[13:37:46] <gordian> i'm trying to make sure that the div.container height animates smoothly after the text gets replaced
[13:37:58] <gordian> in your fiddle it still jumps
[13:38:02] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:38:03] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:38:08] <duch_kazatel> start by not replacing HTML.
[13:38:11] <duch_kazatel> start by replacing text.
[13:38:39] <gordian> ok
[13:39:18] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need to work on getting your height calculations done.
[13:43:30] <zumba_addict> is it possible to pull an external html into a div just like iframe?
[13:44:12] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict "just like iframe" - huh?
[13:44:16] <duch_kazatel> that's not what iframes do.
[13:44:24] <duch_kazatel> you can do that, but it's painful to do.
[13:44:28] <zumba_addict> got it
[13:44:39] <zumba_addict> i thought that iframe was built for that
[13:44:53] <zumba_addict> i need to read up on it again :)
[13:45:12] <duch_kazatel> iframes load an entire other document into an inline frame (hence the name)
[13:46:11] <gordian> zumba_addict: sounds like you're looking for $.load();
[13:46:22] <zumba_addict> got it, thanks gordian
[13:46:58] <duch_kazatel> fyi $.load() is a shorthand for $.ajax(), but it won't do the second part she's looking for.
[13:47:18] <duch_kazatel> it'll put stuff into a div, but it won't filter through the entire ajax response for just the content you need.
[13:47:22] <zumba_addict> that worked gordian
[13:47:44] <zumba_addict> why choose load over iframe and vice versa?
[13:47:51] <duch_kazatel> you want to use ajax.
[13:48:12] <duch_kazatel> vs needing to load a bunch of "sandboxed" dependencied for a small snipped.
[13:48:14] <duch_kazatel> *snippet
[13:50:36] <gordian> √
[13:50:50] <spekode> A-ok!
[13:53:23] <zumba_addict> thanks duch_kazatel
[13:53:27] <duch_kazatel> sure
[13:53:54] <gordian> is it possible to use $.load(); with a string instead of a url?
[13:54:05] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:54:20] <duch_kazatel> it's a convenience method for $.ajax().
[13:54:21] <gordian> if i want to load a string into a DIV
[13:54:28] <gordian> yes i know
[13:54:31] <duch_kazatel> you want to put text in a div?
[13:54:47] <gordian> but if i just use text() or html() or even replace() then the next statement fires immediately
[13:54:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:54:58] <duch_kazatel> what do you need?
[13:55:09] <duch_kazatel> because load would certainly not solve that problem
[13:55:09] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:55:10] <gordian> i'd like to be able to replace a DIV's text or image and then use a callback function
[13:57:58] <gordian> cause if i replace text or an image i can cache the container's original height, but i need to know the new height if i'm going to animate it
[14:00:01] <gordian> grr
[14:01:45] <duch_kazatel> back
[14:01:56] <duch_kazatel> then rerun the selector.
[14:02:26] <gordian> huh?
[14:02:47] <duch_kazatel> you're caching the heigh.  re-cache is
[14:02:50] <duch_kazatel> *it
[14:03:11] <gordian> hmm
[14:03:17] <BillCris_> gordian: CSS animating or jQuery?
[14:03:23] <duch_kazatel> guys
[14:03:28] <BillCris_> hahahah
[14:03:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCris_ has a weird name
[14:03:35] <duch_kazatel> i want to fix it?
[14:03:36] <BillCris_> Need a slider script.
[14:03:36] <gordian> well i have transitions set
[14:04:00] <BillCris_> gordian: You can animate max-height instead of height for a work around.
[14:04:26] <BillCriswell> There we go duch_kazatel.
[14:04:44] <duch_kazatel> guys
[14:04:53] <duch_kazatel> where is BillCris_ :(
[14:05:01] <duch_kazatel> anyway - how goes mano?
[14:05:07] <BillCriswell> That guy left, total loser.
[14:05:22] <BillCriswell> I'm good, ready for the day to be over.. which is good considering it's 5 after 5.
[14:05:36] <duch_kazatel> woop
[14:06:00] <gordian> BillCriswell: i have transitions set to animate all, do i need to specify max-height?
[14:06:32] <BillCriswell> gordian: Not if you have them all set I don't think.
[14:07:00] <gordian> balls
[14:08:49] <BillCriswell> gordian: http://jsbin.com/koguzeyu/1/edit?css,js,output
[14:10:07] <gordian> hrmmm
[14:10:11] <gordian> that's a good one
[14:10:27] <gordian> problem is i won't know the final height
[14:10:30] <BillCriswell> I think it sucks you need to do that to animate to auto... but whatever.
[14:11:12] <drej> gordian set max-height to something big
[14:11:16] <drej> like 10000px
[14:11:18] <drej> and animate that
[14:11:19] <gordian> BillCriswell: here's my example: http://jsfiddle.net/silb3r/2k658/
[14:11:23] <drej> its not efficient, but it works
[14:11:27] <BillCriswell> drej: That's what I showed.
[14:11:34] <gordian> err, http://jsfiddle.net/silb3r/2k658/2/
[14:11:34] <drej> i wasnt paying attention
[14:11:36] <drej> dont yell at me
[14:11:36] <BillCriswell> I hate that that's a solution for it.
[14:12:02] <BillCriswell> drej: WELL READ ABSOLUTE EVERYTHING IN THE LAST HOUR FIRST.
[14:12:03] <gordian> man this whole thing is jank
[14:12:15] <duch_kazatel> jank stank.
[14:12:20] <drej> BillCriswell im sorry sir
[14:12:22] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-fRuoMIfpw
[14:12:27] <BillCriswell> hahaha
[14:12:36] <drej> it wont happen again
[14:12:48] <BillCriswell> I'm going home. Take it easy everyone!
[14:12:53] <duch_kazatel> enjoy captain
[14:12:58] <Cork> drej: max-height isn't a solution though
[14:13:15] <Cork> drej: at least if you want a constant animation effect
[14:13:40] <drej> it will constantly animate it to that max-height
[14:13:41] <Cork> as it will animate the change but as of how much it is of the 10000px change
[14:13:49] <Cork> so the animation looks really strange
[14:14:03] <Cork> drej: ya, if you actually fill the full height
[14:14:11] <Cork> if the auto is say 10% of it
[14:14:23] <Cork> the height change will go much slower then you expect
[14:14:34] <Cork> so max-height isn't really a solution
[14:47:07] <jesseatschool> How can i search an selection list and return an object from a matching value property :  <option value="matchthis">
[14:47:49] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[14:48:21] <jesseatschool> can it even be done?
[14:48:36] <duch_kazatel> lol yeah, it can.
[14:49:53] <duch_kazatel> it's called an attribute selector.
[14:49:54] <duch_kazatel> $('select[value="matchthis"]')
[14:49:58] <duch_kazatel> they are very slow.
[14:50:12] <v0id3d> duch quick question - should i not be able to chain my plugin i made to be like $('#test').blur().myplugin();
[14:50:25] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d that entirely depends.
[14:50:38] <v0id3d> upon?
[14:50:42] <duch_kazatel> return values.
[14:51:20] <v0id3d> when i run $('#test').myplugin(); it works
[14:51:46] <duch_kazatel> right - look at the return value for .blur()
[14:51:58] <v0id3d> i got you ok
[14:55:25] <jesseatschool> duch_kazatel  so then is it possible to search it based on a value passed into a function? $('option[value="searchVal"]') where serachval is being passed in
[15:02:59] <vol4ko2> i am wondering what is the loading image still on the testimonials slider here http://ehrlichessenmethode.de/
[15:06:58] <synth_> vol4ko2 http://pastebin.com/XD9BrPgs
[15:08:32] <synth_> vol4ko2 basically points to: http://ehrlichessenmethode.de/wp-content/themes/CherryFramework/images/camera-loader.gif
[15:09:27] <ikla> what standard is used for a website page structure tags etc.?
[15:09:36] <ikla> w3c
[15:10:44] <systemfault> w3c is a consortium.
[15:11:05] <systemfault> Standards are like CSS3 HTML5 ECMAScript5
[15:13:16] <vol4ko2> synth_ thats the loader for the main slider
[15:13:38] <vol4ko2> but did you noticed the loader on the footer (testimonials)
[15:13:45] <vol4ko2> its still here
[15:15:23] <vol4ko2> hah found it.

[17:00:18] <tds5016> hi all. I am looking for the easiest way to tell when a div loses focus.
[17:00:45] <tds5016> not an input box or anything like that... I just need an event to fire when I click anything not a specific div when that div is displayed.
[17:01:04] <duch_kazatel> that's... not how focus works.
[17:01:18] <tds5016> yeah... it's the wrong word for it....
[17:01:34] <tds5016> lol. but I'm trying to avoid attaching a listener to document
[17:01:56] <duch_kazatel> how about you explain what you're actually trying to do.
[17:02:19] <tds5016> I have a popup... when I click anywhere not on the popup, I want the popup to close.
[17:02:29] <duch_kazatel> a popup, or a modal?
[17:02:44] <tds5016> modal that I've created from scratch.
[17:02:46] <tds5016> sorry.
[17:03:03] <duch_kazatel> create an overlay div and bind your listener to that.
[17:03:29] <tds5016> that was another option. I was hoping to avoid that.
[17:03:32] <tds5016> but fair enough.
[17:03:58] <duch_kazatel> your other constraints are not realistic.
[17:04:35] <tds5016> you are correct. Is there another way I should be doing this?
[17:04:46] <tds5016> that would allow me to not add another div?
[17:04:47] <duch_kazatel> the overlay div ;)
[17:04:54] <tds5016> ^^
[17:04:56] <duch_kazatel> you shouold fade the background anyway.
[17:05:12] <tds5016> not for this spectific thing.
[17:05:18] <tds5016> it's essntially a drop down menu
[17:05:31] <duch_kazatel> wait then why did you call it a modal?
[17:05:32] <tds5016> that I want to be able to have clicked.
[17:05:48] <tds5016> because it's written the same way as a modal.
[17:05:52] <duch_kazatel> then you need to attach a listener to document
[17:06:03] <tds5016> what's the best way to do that?
[17:06:03] <duch_kazatel> your constraints are not realistic.
[17:06:17] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('click', function() {});
[17:06:45] <duch_kazatel> actually, do $(document).on('click', function(e){}); and then check e.eventTarget within your handler.
[17:07:38] <ddssc> using select2 plugin with tags and hidden input field. however when I submit my form that contais this hidden field the field values aren't populated. any ideas why?
[17:09:12] <decx> it's just target
[17:09:26] <duch_kazatel> err, yeah, e.target
[17:11:45] <clime> is there a way to tell jquery-ui dialog to resize itself accorging to its content while it is open?
[17:12:04] <clime> something like dialogElem.dialog('resize')
[17:13:55] <JayBob> Hello
[17:14:10] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:17:25] <tds5016> $(document).not("#languageSelection")
[17:17:32] <tds5016> am I going about that all wrong/
[17:17:33] <tds5016> ?*
[17:17:43] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:17:59] <tds5016> I am trying to select everythin gbut languageSelection
[17:18:06] <tds5016> everything but*
[17:18:26] <duch_kazatel> $('*:not("#languageSelection")')
[17:18:35] <duch_kazatel> though that's still awful.
[17:18:47] <duch_kazatel> please don't tell me you'll then bind an event handler to that.
[17:18:48] <tds5016> what would the right way to do it be?
[17:19:13] <tds5016> the only thing I'm trying to do is like I said before, make the menu go away when I click anywhere else.
[17:19:44] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('click', function(e){ /* look at e.target */ });
[17:19:58] <tds5016> nice. that should work.
[17:20:00] <tds5016> thanks much!
[17:20:17] <decx> yeah it's going to be a pain that way
[17:20:28] <duch_kazatel> your entire UX is funky either way imo.
[17:20:33] <decx> overlaydiv is superior in convenience
[17:21:20] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[17:22:06] <duch_kazatel> or don't use mouseclicks on website.
[17:22:10] <duch_kazatel> *websites for menus.
[17:22:19] <tds5016> huh?
[17:22:57] <duch_kazatel> your UX is confusing and weird.  are you opening menu items by clicking?
[17:23:48] <tds5016> duch_kazatel: yes. it's a language button in the corner.
[17:24:06] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[17:24:08] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:24:09] <tds5016> I don't want it to be a hover; I'd rather it be a complete click in order to access it.
[17:24:16] <tds5016> don't do that? what should I do instead? lol.
[17:24:19] <duch_kazatel> it should be a mouseenter.
[17:24:41] <tds5016> I don't want this being hover.... it needs to work with a tablet.
[17:24:57] <duch_kazatel> handle tablet differently.
[17:25:10] <duch_kazatel> don't break your desktop ux for tablet, and vice versa.
[17:26:10] <duch_kazatel> detect for touch and go from there, though be careful of IE11.
[17:28:03] <tds5016> duch_kazatel: it's not really breaking the UX. I'd have to show you the design for you to see how this works.
[17:28:32] <tds5016> it actually makes a lot more sense than you'd think. I can see how you'd be confused based on the description though.
[17:28:54] <duch_kazatel> you're bucking a common desktop experience.  i still say it's a bad idea.  but I'm wrong!
[17:29:30] <tds5016> these are notification buttons.... they themselves aren't so much links.
[17:29:39] <tds5016> it's like a sign in or sign out button in the right hand corner.
[17:29:52] <duch_kazatel> hovers still sound more sensible to me.
[17:29:54] <tds5016> you don't want to activate them just by hovering.
[17:29:59] <duch_kazatel> i would, but meh.
[17:30:20] <tds5016> fair enough. I mean I legitimately see where you're coming from... and I wish I cou;d share the design.
[17:30:28] <tds5016> ina  few months I'll be able to :-)
[17:30:33] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:31:12] <duch_kazatel> can you name any other site that uses that kind of UX?
[17:32:30] <clime> so it is dialogElem.dialog('option', 'height', 'auto')
[17:32:47] <decx> i played around a bit with target instead of an overlay div http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8M9nD/
[17:33:39] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:36:53] <decx> are you sad because i didnt use .on? ^^
[17:37:03] <duch_kazatel> joined #jquery
[17:37:03] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:18:17:35:37] * shoelessone (~shoelesso@76.14.81.41) Quit (Remote host closed t
[17:37:05] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[17:37:09] <duch_kazatel> content = myselector.contents().andSelf();
[17:37:10] <duch_kazatel> that
[17:37:17] <duch_kazatel> goddammit mirc i wish i could turn off autocopy.
[17:37:37] <decx> yeah it's not that great
[17:37:45] <decx> but better than $('div,div>*')
[17:39:10] <zumba_addict> i noticed with .load(), it doesn't know where to download the other links embedded on the page you are downloading
[17:39:29] <duch_kazatel> $.load()?
[17:39:32] <zumba_addict> yup
[17:39:34] <duch_kazatel> or $.fn.load()?
[17:39:49] <duch_kazatel> "it doesn't know where to download the other links embedded on the page you are downloading"
[17:39:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:39:51] <zumba_addict> $('#somediv').load('url');
[17:40:12] <duch_kazatel> ah the ajax method.
[17:40:31] <zumba_addict> for example, it downloads the index.html, it loads it fine. But the images on it, it's being pulled from the current site you are in
[17:40:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah - you're injecting the markup as-is.
[17:40:51] <duch_kazatel> or whatever you're injecting.
[17:41:00] <zumba_addict> how can i make it behave like iframe?
[17:41:13] <zumba_addict> or looks like it's a tough work
[17:41:18] <duch_kazatel> parse the return and correct the URLs.
[17:41:35] <duch_kazatel> i'd use $.ajax() and massage the data first, then inject it where I want it.
[17:41:36] <zumba_addict> ok
[17:41:44] <zumba_addict> ok
[17:42:23] <clime> hmm it iseems that height: auto does not respect maxHeight: x  for jquery-ui dialogs
[17:42:27] <zumba_addict> the webserver is going to be one of our devices which is a printer. We haven't see the html output yet. Hopefully we;ll have the device tomorrow
[17:42:47] <duch_kazatel> ok.
[17:43:09] <zumba_addict> i hope the printer doesn't have cors issue
[17:43:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:43:23] <zumba_addict> if it does, we might end up using iframes
[17:43:28] <zumba_addict> i mean, cors support
[17:43:30] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[17:43:42] <duch_kazatel> what does a printer have to do with CORS?
[17:43:54] <zumba_addict> it will be on a different subnet
[17:44:00] <zumba_addict> and domain
[17:44:15] <duch_kazatel> how are you accessing it through a site?
[17:44:17] <zumba_addict> the printer provides html output on its status
[17:44:21] <zumba_addict> via http
[17:44:23] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah.
[17:44:31] <duch_kazatel> i'd just iframe personally.
[17:44:34] <duch_kazatel> and be done with it.
[17:44:38] <zumba_addict> yup, that's true
[17:47:48] <clime> actually it does respect maxHeight:x I was wrong, so it is all ok
[17:52:37] <v0id3d> can anyone assist me in how i can make my plugin chainable to the .on
[17:54:39] <duch_kazatel> "chainable to the .on()
[17:54:40] <duch_kazatel> "
[17:54:42] <duch_kazatel> meaning...?
[17:55:07] <v0id3d> i asked you earlier to do like .on('blur').myplugin()
[17:55:16] <v0id3d> i have not found anything on how to do it
[17:55:57] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting to happen when you do that?
[17:55:57] <v0id3d> so i am stuck doing the .on('blur', function(){$('#test').myplugin()}
[17:56:27] <v0id3d> or is the second method really the only way
[17:56:56] <duch_kazatel> that would be the only way, yes.
[17:57:14] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to specify a callback using a chained method?
[17:57:18] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense
[17:57:50] <v0id3d> well to not have to write all the stuff over again hahaha
[17:57:50] <duch_kazatel> since you're trying to run your method on whatever object is returned from .on() - not what you want to do.
[17:58:11] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to init something when something else is clicked?
[17:58:22] <v0id3d> blured yes
[17:58:34] <duch_kazatel> you should learn about return values and functions.
[17:58:40] <duch_kazatel> and event bindings.
[17:58:51] <duch_kazatel> that should help you grasp what's going on there.
[17:59:00] <v0id3d> i thought i had somewhat of grasp on it but cleaerly i am wrong haha
[17:59:12] <duch_kazatel> you're confused about callbacks.
[17:59:50] <v0id3d> ill give it another go
[18:00:11] <duch_kazatel> callbacks and method chaining are two different techniques btw.
[18:00:28] <duch_kazatel> sometimes, $(selector).myMethod1().myMethod2() is appropriate.
[18:00:43] <duch_kazatel> but that doesn't work when you need callbacks.
[18:01:13] <v0id3d> ok i got you now
[18:01:50] <duch_kazatel> cool :)
[18:01:59] <duch_kazatel> javascript objects are simple, but very powerful.
[18:02:15] <v0id3d> i am starting to learn that
[18:04:01] <duch_kazatel> all right.  headed out.  enjoy!
[18:19:58] <axilaris> hi i made this table, and was able to get the selected row information, how can i iterate the whole table to get the row ids ? is that possible ? http://jsfiddle.net/x6c2K/6/
[18:21:46] <axilaris> i found out this  $('#tableId > tr').each(function() {
[18:22:02] <axilaris> but what is the looped key ?
[18:27:07] <angel> hello, why this code doesn't work? thanks http://jsfiddle.net/JnWx6/
[18:27:38] <axilaris> angel: try mine http://jsfiddle.net/x6c2K/6/
[18:28:22] <tds5016> I can't for the life of me remember... what is the javascript for getting the width of a div in pixels?
[18:28:28] <tds5016> without getting "px"
[18:28:33] <tds5016> tacked onto the end?
[18:36:30] <angel> axilaris i cannot figure out why it doesn't work on mine http://jsfiddle.net/JnWx6/1/
[18:47:37] <jwmann> Is it possible to have a callback function for the .toggleClass() method?
[18:48:15] <jwmann> I need to run a function after that method and I can chain a function (unless there's a method for that :S)
[19:02:30] <shoky> jwmann: jquery's toggleClass? or jquery-ui's?
[19:03:01] <shoky> jquery's is not async, whatever you put after it will run after the class has been toggled
[19:04:10] <shoky> (and for jquery-ui's you can supply a "complete" callback)
[19:06:51] <jwmann> shoky: jQuery
[19:11:22] <jwmann> shoky: Is there a method I can use to call a regular function?
[19:11:31] <shoky> wat?
[19:11:37] <shoky> just.. call it?
[19:11:56] <tripflex> what's the best way to make sure my code executes last on a page?  i mean besides document ready
[19:11:59] <jwmann> Like $( "foobar" ).call( myfunction() ).this().that();
[19:12:26] <jwmann> I'm trying to chain my method and I need to call a function in the middle of that chain
[19:12:27] <shoky> myfunction(); $("foobar").this().that();
[19:12:48] <tripflex> make an anonymous function and run it?
[19:12:49] <jwmann> shoky: That works but the function needs to be called in the middle of my chain.
[19:12:51] <shoky> if you want to make a function that you can call on jquery objects, you want to make what's called a plugin
[19:13:08] <shoky> $.fn.mymethod = function() {  }
[19:13:15] <jwmann> hmm
[19:13:22] <shoky> return this  inside to enable chaining
[19:13:43] <shoky> what you showed isn't in the middle of a chain btw
[19:14:01] <jwmann> Well I made this, does this make sense? http://d.pr/n/dk6q/40CQCKIz
[19:14:24] <shoky> no
[19:14:31] <shoky> and wth is $.apply
[19:14:37] <shoky> oh
[19:14:38] <shoky> sorry :)
[19:14:53] <shoky> but still doesn't make sense
[19:15:40] <shoky> what's "fn"
[19:15:58] <shoky> guess you meant fn.apply, not $.apply
[19:16:31] <jwmann> shoky: Well I found it from here - http://stackoverflow.com/a/3903341/185731
[19:16:45] <jwmann> however I get an error when using fn.apply
[19:16:49] <jwmann> :S
[19:17:08] <shoky> just say what you wanna do..
[19:18:40] <jwmann> I want to do this: $( ".myelement" ).method(  ).method(  ).call( myfunction() ).method(  ).method(  );
[19:19:37] <shoky> var el = $( ".myelement" ).method(  ).method(  );   myfunction();  el.method().method();
[19:20:06] <shoky> btw if you really want to use that snippet from the SO answer.. do .call(myfunction)  not .call(myfunction())
[19:20:22] <shoky> but.. this seems all wrong :(
[19:20:53] <shoky> seems very much to be an XY situation
[19:20:56] <jwmann> shoky: well, the way you proposed, it would run the function first and then run the chain no?
[19:21:05] <shoky> no
[19:21:21] <shoky> it would run the first 2 methods. then call myfunction(). then run the last 2 methods
[19:21:50] <shoky> tho i dunno which "way i proposed" you're referring to
[19:22:34] <jwmann> The one where you're declaring the el variable
[19:22:44] <shoky> yah. then what i said
[19:23:31] <shoky> and i wasn't really proposing it
[19:23:39] <shoky> you haven't specified what your real problem is
[19:23:52] <shoky> you're hung up on some solution that seems irrelevant
[19:25:03] <jwmann> My issue is that I can't call the function before the chain, and I can't call the function after the chain.
[19:25:14] <jwmann> But I will try your solution
[19:25:55] <jwmann> But removing the () from my .call( myfunction() ) seems to remove that error I was getting fn.apply
[19:25:59] <shoky> chaining just means calling a method on the return value of the previous method call
[19:26:05] <shoky> so if you put that return value in a var
[19:26:09] <shoky> and use the var, it's equivalent
[19:26:20] <jwmann> Oh, really?
[19:26:25] <jwmann> Didn't know that.
[19:26:28] <jwmann> Thanks :)
[19:26:42] <shoky> ;]
[19:27:22] <jwmann> Anyway, Thanks for putting up with my pandering. I learnt some new things. :)
[19:43:42] <acidjazz> if i .remove() a jquery element.. do all of its handlers get cleaned up? or should i .unbind them first?
[19:46:46] <tds5016> how would I test if an id is in a list of the a child's parents?
[21:11:42] <mitchdotpro> Hey guys! Can anyone tell me how I detect the user scrolling up and down while I have overflow: hidden on the body? Essentially I want users to scroll down and flick to the next panel, so I want to hijack the scroll experience.

[23:51:04] <Abbbbbbhi> Anyone ?
[23:52:56] <beancurd> sups.
[23:56:23] <Abbbbbbhi> Question, - I have drop down menu where each menu item is displayed with small img and text (like <a><span><img></img><span>text is displayed</span></span></a> the text span has following style overflow:hidden and display:block. While using korean language in firefxo everything looks good but in IE9 upper part of text is turncated
[23:57:14] <Abbbbbbhi> if i neither make display:inline or overflow:auto it fixes the issue in IE but it is not correct solution. can i add any other style attribute to fix it
