[00:00:26] <systemfault> Can't help you on thatâ€¦ I never used the "debugger" command :/
[00:00:27] <Spami> So yeah in either debugger I'm getting "ReferenceError: dom is not defined"
[00:00:41] <Spami> systemfault, well it's like a breakpoint,
[00:01:00] <systemfault> It should be accessibleâ€¦ could be because it's an async function and it messes up with the debugger.
[00:01:10] <systemfault> Use a console.log instead just to see.
[00:06:01] <Spami> systemfault, yeah seems about right
[00:31:27] <uuzilla> hello
[00:34:59] <uuzilla> Helo, I have a php array data and want to print it using javascript
[00:35:09] <uuzilla> How to do it? please please me
[00:36:52] <systemfault> More info required.
[00:38:09] <uuzilla> I have a php script and I can get data from my database but it is in aarray I want to print the same using javascript ?
[00:39:18] <systemfault> uuzilla: How do you want to get the data? include it on the page? Load it via ajax?
[00:39:38] <uuzilla> any solution will be fine
[00:39:48] <uuzilla> I am k with the easy one
[00:39:59] <uuzilla> sorry ok instead k
[00:40:46] <systemfault> You could do it via ajax
[00:41:01] <systemfault> Do you use any framework for PHP?
[00:42:43] <uuzilla> nope. but how using ajax
[00:43:33] <uuzilla> which is the best framework for php and javascript on ubuntu
[00:44:21] <systemfault> uuzilla: That's could be an hour long discussionâ€¦
[00:44:35] <systemfault> uuzilla: Laravel is the cool PHP framework of the moment.
[00:44:56] <systemfault> uuzilla: For the frontend, jQuery is the most used library for DOM manipulation.
[00:45:21] <systemfault> Learning a frameworks takes time though.
[00:45:27] <systemfault> -s
[00:48:50] <uuzilla> thans dude .. But I want a quick solution . Please print the ajax code here
[00:52:32] <systemfault> uuzilla: You know how to print HTML with PHP?
[00:52:59] <uuzilla> Yep html and php code is done
[00:53:11] <systemfault> uuzilla: You're familiar with JSON?
[00:53:16] <uuzilla> I want the php data array in javascript variable
[00:53:28] <uuzilla> nope.
[00:55:39] <systemfault> uuzilla: JSON is a way to serialize data for transmission
[00:55:56] <systemfault> uuzilla: Basically, it looks like javascript objects in a string
[00:56:04] <uuzilla> thanks
[00:56:08] <uuzilla> ok further
[00:56:24] <systemfault> uuzilla: You have to first create a PHP array with your data and then echo json_encode($myArray);
[00:56:26] <uuzilla> how to introduce that in php script or something
[00:56:37] <uuzilla> ok. sure thing
[00:58:55] <uuzilla> ok done that next
[01:00:21] <systemfault> Does it work when you try to access the page where you put that JSON?
[01:00:42] <systemfault> You should see something that ressembles Javascript
[01:00:51] <uuzilla> nope. t isnot working
[01:01:10] <uuzilla> where can I post my code
[01:01:42] <systemfault> I don't knowâ€¦ pastebin or ideone or codepadâ€¦
[01:01:50] <ilu9> Chrome->dev-tools->Profile->HeapSnapShot shows me an increasing heap for a page which does an automatic refresh per ajax every second for a part of the page. how can I analyze the reason? there is so much in the snapshot, I don't understand...
[01:01:57] <Uhkis> ?paste @ uuzilla
[01:01:57] <b-ot> uuzilla: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:11:39] <uuzilla> Hello, I have pasted the code on sos911.tk/new.html
[01:11:59] <uuzilla> please look at that and correct the missing instructions
[01:17:34] <uuzilla> Hello, info was helpful or not
[01:17:54] <uuzilla> please post something to satisfy my goal
[01:23:25] <uuzilla> I did it in a stupid way but it wil never work I know
[01:23:43] <uuzilla> but still I want some help in this regard,
[01:29:52] <Uhkis> uuzilla: you have a typo there... $phpvar and $php_var
[01:44:12] <metallico> i have a problem with jquery mobile: if i change the page back to the index from a second page - the pageint event does not fire
[02:47:35] <Vivekananda_y510> hello anyone around
[02:47:59] <arisalexis> me but not a guru
[02:48:53] <Vivekananda_y510> :)
[02:50:34] <arisalexis> well ask anyway
[02:52:56] <phoenixsun> what is the best method of generating Html using jquery within the webpages html file?
[02:54:37] <arisalexis> can you be more specific?
[02:55:23] <phoenixsun> I want to add a randomized index parameter to an embedded youtube playlist
[02:56:06] <phoenixsun> and want create the random number then generate the embed code using JQuery
[02:56:13] <arisalexis> make a random function and make a for loop w jquery adding the elements to the dom
[02:56:40] <arisalexis> like $(document).['someId'].addElementWithRandomId
[02:56:55] <phoenixsun> I understand the looping at all that logic part
[02:57:20] <phoenixsun> its just the actual line that generates the html that I have been confused with
[02:57:35] <phoenixsun> I have seen implementations where append() was used
[02:57:50] <phoenixsun> at = and
[02:58:51] <arisalexis> look up the jquery documentation about appending elements sure sounds ok
[02:59:00] <Uhkis> i'd say html() is good if you want to replace
[02:59:42] <phoenixsun> ok I will look up jquery on append() and html()
[03:00:47] <Uhkis> apparently there's replaceWith also
[03:16:04] <Vivekananda_y510> I was hoping moon cup would show sometime
[03:16:17] <Vivekananda_y510> possible to ask the bot ?
[03:50:04] <robert124> hi. i just played with my first multi-page jquery mobile page, with a page #one and #two, copied from the example; when i access the page with #two in the url, it works fine -- i have links to switch back and forth between pages and everything seems great. but when i access the webpage without anchor, or anchor #one, the links that should forward to the other page do nothing. i don't get errors in the javascript error console or anything,
[03:50:04] <robert124>  though. any hint?
[03:50:32] <robert124> analog to the jquery mobile demo: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/pages-multi-page/
[03:57:13] <phoenixsun> how does one work with strings that themselves contain double inverted commas
[03:57:14] <phoenixsun> ?
[03:57:41] <robert124> sorry, problem seems to have been caused by me using mustache on the webpage -- it made things unresponsive and buggy. without mustache, jquery mobile works fine. thanks.
[04:02:15] <phoenixsun> ok remembered I can escape them
[04:25:34] <Atque> Does jquery have any functions appropriate for parsing HTML templates clientside?
[04:25:43] <luvmyh0nda-[idle> is now away: [reason: Idle after 10h]±[pager: yes]±[ç§]
[05:04:44] <ili88> my chrome profiler shows several elements which are detached from dom tree. how can i clean them up? maybe if I add something like a periodicalExecuter on the, whoch checks if they are still part of the dom tree, otherwise remove itself?
[05:17:40] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, any chance you are around
[05:34:24] <Vivekananda_y510> hey everyone. downloaded a web app ( demo dashboard) and ran on localhost and it runs fine. Trying the same thing via drupal gives me a dimensions error for some jquery. Can someone help me a bit with this ? . Here is the direct localhost : http://localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html   and here is the drupal + apache :  localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html
[05:39:08] <nicolas_FR> hi there, would like to know what $({deg :0}) means as a selector... ?
[05:39:14] <nutzz> Is it corrct to append a div like this: $('parent').append('<div id="child">'); $('parent').append('content'); $('parent').append('</div>')?
[05:39:31] <Hooloovoo> nicolas_FR: Umm... nothing afaik.
[05:39:54] <nicolas_FR> Hooloovoo: looking from http://jsfiddle.net/UB2XR/23/
[05:40:35] <nicolas_FR> used for animate().. but would like to understand it
[05:41:23] <Hooloovoo> nicolas_FR: That's just used as a dummy from what i understand.
[05:41:36] <nicolas_FR> nutzz: $('parent') doesn't exists (would be <parent> tag)
[05:41:59] <nicolas_FR> Hooloovoo: a dummy ? I don't get it sry
[05:42:16] <miCSu> nicolas_FR: it's the name of the attribute
[05:42:43] <nutzz> nicolas_FR: parent Is a generic name used to describe that I append that div to it's parent
[05:42:45] <Hooloovoo> nicolas_FR: It's a hack to use the animate function to apply a css transform.
[05:42:50] <nicolas_FR> so you can select directly with an attribute ? Like $({color:blue}) ?
[05:44:15] <nicolas_FR> nutzz: you would maybe first construct your content like : var content = '<div>content</div>'; and then append(content)
[05:44:34] <nutzz> thanks
[05:45:40] <Hooloovoo> Nope, i don't have a clue how that works actually... :S
[05:46:13] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone care to comment on my problem
[05:46:47] <nutzz> nicolas_FR: This is more a matter of readable code, but should I format the html code properly inside the string? I mean, should I indent tags?
[05:47:29] <miCSu> Vivekananda_y510: I guess that might have a lot to do with drupal configs
[05:47:32] <Hooloovoo> nicolas_FR: Oh wait, i think i get it now. The selector just creates a really dumbed down fake element that it can run the easing function on.
[05:48:00] <mdev> http://pastebin.com/v2CDAuGB
[05:48:08] <mdev> how come console.log doesn't show this properly
[05:48:08] <Hooloovoo> First it creates that element as $({deg: 0}), which creates a jquery element from a object containing just deg: 0
[05:48:09] <nicolas_FR> Hooloovoo: the selector..creates an element ?
[05:48:20] <mdev> only when I remove JSON.stringify
[05:48:28] <nicolas_FR> nutzz: up to you, but sure indenting is easier to read
[05:48:39] <nutzz> ok, thanks
[05:49:03] <Hooloovoo> When you pass in .animate({deg: d} it runs the usual easing function on the "deg" property with "d" as a target value. :)
[05:49:29] <Hooloovoo> it's a quirk of how jquery works, but yea. {deg: 0} is supposed to imitate a element. Give the function something to set a value to.
[05:49:40] <nicolas_FR> Hooloovoo: ah yes ! and then on each step change the css value of element
[05:49:45] <Hooloovoo> yes :)
[05:49:58] <Hooloovoo> that's why it's changed using the already stored "elem" variable.
[05:50:00] <nicolas_FR> Hooloovoo: damn twisted minds...
[05:50:04] <Hooloovoo> :D
[05:50:14] <nicolas_FR> thanks for the reading help :)
[05:50:18] <Hooloovoo> Np!
[05:50:45] <mdev> no one knows?
[05:50:47] <mdev> ugh
[05:51:52] <Quirker> hey is it good to have multiple document readys?
[05:52:01] <Vivekananda_y510> miCSu, sorry about the post above it was localhost. Here is the correct question
[05:52:10] <Vivekananda_y510> . downloaded a web app ( demo dashboard) and ran on localhost and it runs fine. Trying the same thing via drupal gives me a dimensions error for some jquery. Can someone help me a bit with this ? . Here is the direct localhost : http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com//safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html   and here is the drupal + apache :  http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/dashboard-graph1.html
[05:52:13] <Hooloovoo> mdev: i do
[05:52:18] <miCSu> mdev: I'm not sure if that constructs json element
[05:52:20] <nicolas_FR>  $("<div id='fake' deg=0 />").animate({deg: d}, { is the same. Piuf :) (always forget about creating elements with $("<tag>")
[05:52:22] <Hooloovoo> mdev: You're setting a property on a array.
[05:52:35] <Quirker> i have multiple document readys because i have two js files included
[05:52:40] <Quirker> is that a bad or okay thing?
[05:52:42] <Hooloovoo> mdev: try this http://pastebin.com/6kzQJSQt
[05:53:19] <mdev> great thank you
[05:55:02] <mdev> that fixed it!
[05:55:10] <mdev> wasted like hour trying to get that to go
[05:55:10] <Hooloovoo> mdev: nps
[05:55:15] <Hooloovoo> :)
[05:55:18] <Hooloovoo> it happens
[05:55:52] <Zac12> how would it be possible for me to only reveal the website once everything on the page is  loaded?
[05:56:38] <Hooloovoo> Zac12: body{display: none} in the header? :P
[05:56:49] <Hooloovoo> Then turn it back on in JS
[05:56:52] <Hooloovoo> maybe?
[05:57:01] <Zac12> tried that Hooloovoo, it doesn't exactly work across all browsers
[05:57:13] <Zac12> :(
[05:57:18] <miCSu> Vivekananda_y510: There's quite an amount to debug there. Perhaps it's just 'cause height's zero?
[05:57:21] <Hooloovoo> body {opacity: 0}
[05:57:23] <Hooloovoo> ?
[05:58:20] <Zac12> lemme try
[05:58:23] <miCSu> Zac12: tou have the js in $(document).ready or such ?
[05:58:39] <Zac12> I don't like the way that my webpage loads, the order of which elements load first makes it look very bad
[05:58:48] <Zac12> I'd like it to all appear at once
[05:59:10] <Zac12> yeah miCSu: $( document ).ready(function() {
[05:59:46] <miCSu> did you try with opacity as Hooloovoo suggested?
[06:00:16] <Vivekananda_y510> miCSu, I am trying to understand that itself ie why is this height thing zero when in apache it is fine
[06:01:05] <Zac12> trying with opacity now miCSu
[06:02:53] <Aric> I'm using $.ajax and the result looks fine but I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :"
[06:03:05] <Aric> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mU3E3Nia
[06:03:09] <Aric> code there
[06:04:22] <BinaryKitten> try quoting your keys
[06:04:37] <Hooloovoo> Aric: Where does it complain that you have a unexpected :?
[06:04:38] <Aric> when i try json instead of jsonp i get an xml header issue
[06:05:08] <Hooloovoo> Aric: What's the response string?
[06:05:13] <Aric> Hooloovoo: in the console and I get the failed result in my code and no access to the result... though i can see the json result in my console... i can also visit the url fine
[06:05:14] <miCSu> Vivekananda_y510: it's hard to tell why I have no clue about that dashboard demo project.
[06:05:24] <Aric> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eUUfcs9k
[06:05:26] <Aric> response string
[06:05:36] <stava> I have an object looking something like {foo: $('#foo'), bar:  $('#bar')}. How do I convert this object into a wrapped jQuery set of elements?
[06:05:49] <miCSu> Vivekananda_y510: maybe there's some erronous paths while the layout also doen't look well after load
[06:06:29] <stava> Clarification: {foo: $('#foo'), bar:  $('#bar')} to $($('#foo'), $('#bar'));
[06:06:30] <BinaryKitten> Aric jsonP = different thing
[06:06:49] <Aric> then what should i use if json doesn't work
[06:07:01] <BinaryKitten> json doesn't work because it's a different domain
[06:07:31] <Hooloovoo> That shouldn't give a syntax error...
[06:07:34] <miCSu> Aric: have you tried with post type?
[06:07:39] <Aric> ya.. so how do I query google elevation service... I'm doing maps and geocode service this way and no problem?
[06:07:51] <Aric> miCSu: yes, the above is just the last iteration i've tried post
[06:08:15] <BinaryKitten> miCSu, Hooloovoo  ... the issue is that the jsonP request doesn't parse the json as a jsonP script. so it throws error
[06:08:32] <BinaryKitten> the other error (xml) is xmlhttprequest complaining about cross origin
[06:08:35] <Hooloovoo> BinaryKitten: Ohhhh, he was trying jsonp the whole time :)
[06:08:40] <Hooloovoo> that'll cause a error.
[06:08:49] <inad922> anyone know how can I add extra styling for a given column in datatables?
[06:08:57] <BinaryKitten> Aric have you consulted the googlemaps api?
[06:09:20] <BinaryKitten> they have api scrpts that do the bits you need to do directly
[06:09:23] <inad922> I would like to add white-space:nowrap to one of the columns where the command buttons related to the given row are
[06:09:52] <BinaryKitten> inad922 not sure, you'll need to speak to the plugin author
[06:10:12] <BinaryKitten> jquery datatables is a datatables plugin written using jQuery.. not by jQuery
[06:10:57] <inad922> Alright
[06:11:03] <inad922> Thanks anyway BinaryKitten
[06:24:06] <Zac12> opacity works much better thanks miCSu, now is there a way that i could use jquery to make the body's opacity fade from 0 to 1 ?
[06:25:04] <decx> opacity<1 on body doesnt feel right
[06:27:45] <miCSu> yeah, Aric: I guess you should use google's apis instead of direct ajax. Some examples https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/elevation#ElevationExamples
[06:28:12] <Aric> ya I'm testingt he api, adds a dependency but i'll live
[06:28:29] <miCSu> note that you should also include google apis script https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp
[06:29:01] <Zac12> decx: how else would you recommend?
[06:29:07] <miCSu> and use google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', func) instead of $(window).load(func)
[06:29:34] <decx> Zac12 fade a container instead
[06:30:06] <miCSu> Zac12: how about fadein ?
[06:30:26] <Zac12> fadein a jquery function that adjusts opacity?
[06:30:30] <Zac12> lemme check *googles*
[06:31:07] <decx> isnt that just about the first thing that you learn when starting with jquery, show(),hide(),fadeIn
[06:33:54] <BenjaminR> One of you experienced with jstree?
[06:34:17] <BenjaminR> any chance to map json keys to the expected key names?
[06:56:21] <prohobo> hey, if anyone knows something about AJAX... i'm sending a POST request, getting success, but the output is 'undefined'... is the server just not sending any data?
[06:59:31] <nutzz> I have the following html div: <div class="answer master"> and the following jquery event handler 	$('.answer').click(function () {alert();}); I don't know why but it is not triggered when the div is clicked. What's the problem?
[07:00:51] <Aric> Google Maps Web Api includes geocode, timezone and elevation... the first two work fine and the last one gives me errors... I'm not understanding why... Elevation is a webservice... https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/
[07:01:32] <BillCriswell> nutzz: Is .answer available when you try to bind that event listener?
[07:02:13] <BillCriswell> nutzz: If your script is in the head it needs to be in a document ready, if it's directly before </body> it doesn't need to be.
[07:02:15] <nutzz> if I type $('.answer') in chrome console it finds them.
[07:02:24] <nutzz> yes
[07:02:39] <nutzz> I also have other event handlers and they work fine
[07:03:03] <BillCriswell> I'd need to see a demo of it not working then.
[07:03:12] <BillCriswell> Can you replicate it at jsfiddle.net?
[07:03:16] <nutzz> yes
[07:03:19] <nutzz> juts a second
[07:05:57] <BenjaminR> used $.map() inside a function to call it for a json object of infinite depth.  to answer my question myself :)
[07:06:34] <nutzz> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:10:18] <BillCriswell> nutzz: Neeed to click save.
[07:10:39] <nutzz> http://jsfiddle.net/ZmnVK/
[07:11:00] <nutzz> sorry
[07:11:14] <BillCriswell> nutzz: No problem... but this works.
[07:11:40] <nutzz> so you see the popup window?
[07:12:10] <decx> BillCriswell somebody forgot to protect all those southpark mp4s on mtvs servers. better hulu in 50 lines of code http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4M8w8/
[07:12:59] <BillCriswell> decx: Nice. Did you grab them all?
[07:13:24] <decx> somebody made a jsbin, it grabs them from mtvs mobile cdn
[07:13:59] <decx> 720p even
[07:14:33] <BillCriswell> bad ass
[07:15:01] <BillCriswell> nutzz: There's undefined variables.
[07:15:07] <BillCriswell> You have to check out the console on your end.
[07:15:22] <BillCriswell> If I remove all the things that are undefined it works just fine. http://jsfiddle.net/ZmnVK/1/
[07:15:53] <BillCriswell> Is Reverse Cowgirl the toiler episode? I love that one.
[07:16:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah, niiiice.
[07:16:23] <homebrew> hi there, I want to get the left css value for an element using $(this).css("left"), but I am also getting 'px' on the end, which I don't want. What's the best way to get around this?
[07:16:56] <decx> parseInt
[07:16:57] <BillCriswell> homebrew: .offset().left should do it.
[07:17:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, or that.
[07:17:26] <BillCriswell> DigitalOcean gave me a $0.01 credit.
[07:17:30] <BillCriswell> How kind.
[07:19:03] <martixy> Need help with an involved selection: Pick the last(top-most) parent of element A whose children of class X have display style Y
[07:19:07] <homebrew> Perfect, cheers for that
[07:19:40] <decx> i'm going to need a treasure map on that description martixy
[07:20:20] <martixy> huh?
[07:20:23] <BillCriswell> martixy: An element only has one parent.
[07:21:43] <martixy> A.parents() - out of this set pick the last which has a child with class X and display style Y
[07:21:46] <BillCriswell> martixy: Can you give some example HTML with the selected jQuery element and just manually add a class to the one you want to crab.
[07:22:30] <BillCriswell> martixy: It sounds like you're heading down a road of headaches soon.
[07:22:47] <martixy> Why is that?
[07:23:27] <BillCriswell> martixy: It just feels like a messy approach. It's doable for certain but you might want to reconsider the approach?
[07:23:52] <BillCriswell> Why class X and a certain style, shouldn't the style be dictated by the class?
[07:24:32] <martixy> Apparently not. :)
[07:25:41] <BillCriswell> $el.parents().filter(function() { var $this = $(this); return $this.hasClass('foo') && $this.css('padding-left') === '10px'; }).eq(0) should return the first one.
[07:25:52] <decx> good lord
[07:25:59] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes my son.
[07:26:32] <decx> i feel like we're missing something here, you should never have to do that
[07:26:50] <BillCriswell> decx: I concur.
[07:26:59] <Vivekananda_y510> oo people got back around
[07:27:04] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone :)
[07:27:12] <BillCriswell> I was just on my way out!
[07:27:40] <Vivekananda_y510> hmm
[07:27:47] <BillCriswell> Just kidding.
[07:28:29] <martixy> What we're missing is ownership of the page. It's a usability userscript I'm writing for myself. :)
[07:29:07] <BillCriswell> How would you know what class might be on the element?
[07:29:19] <BillCriswell> or is it a usability userscript for one site.
[07:31:27] <martixy> Just the one. And the class is static.
[07:31:56] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[07:32:27] <BillCriswell> If you're selecting by color you're need to use rgba() I believe?
[07:33:20] <BillCriswell> Looks like just rgb()
[07:33:27] <martixy> Actually by display: none or display: block
[07:33:40] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[07:34:15] <BillCriswell> martixy: You can do $el.parents().has('.foo:visible').eq(0) in that case.
[07:34:19] <BillCriswell> or :hidden
[07:35:11] <martixy> Right. Good point.
[07:36:15] <BillCriswell> Would actually be quicker to use each so you can stop traversing the parents early.
[07:36:28] <BillCriswell> Ehhh way overkill but yeah.
[07:43:02] <mlq> Hi, I've written a little userscript and I am trying to dispatch a return/enter key event, but for some reason it does not get fired or maybe facebook has some protection against that?
[07:43:29] <phoenixsun> I am having problems with html in a string and control characters
[07:43:52] <phoenixsun> this code snippet wont work -> http://hastebin.com/xukecotipu.xml
[07:44:41] <decx> don't create an iframe like this
[07:44:56] <dmsuperman> Can somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/3Janbr4u
[07:45:02] <BillCriswell> Whateva, whateva, I do what I want!
[07:45:05] <dmsuperman> I took the result of the seocnd command and pasted it directly into the third command
[07:45:23] <phoenixsun> decx: what is a better approach?
[07:45:30] <decx> any other
[07:45:50] <decx> one second
[07:45:58] <dmsuperman> I also tried using single quotes
[07:46:20] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: That selector is probably tripping up jQuery.
[07:46:57] <BillCriswell> There should be an error... You might be better off using filter and doing .find('input').filter(function(){ return this.value === 'https://105b31079a1ba381f52e-ac2ec5114feb632a1114f20df0e72453.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Intake/unknown_id/Screen Shot 2014-07-21 at 5.16.51 PM.png'; });
[07:47:18] <dmsuperman> isn't the whole point of quotes to avoid tripping up jquery
[07:47:28] <decx> phoenixsun http://jsfiddle.net/decx/SeT65/
[07:47:52] <decx> or just use youtubes iframe api
[07:48:01] <dmsuperman> that would require a bit of rewriting since this query is being generated dynamically so I'd rather figure out how to fix teh selector
[07:48:02] <decx> that would make the most sense
[07:48:43] <phoenixsun> decx: Thanks. I will try to evolve towards using the iFrame Api
[07:49:14] <decx> phoenixsun http://jsfiddle.net/decx/yjqSz/
[07:49:37] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: There's no error though sadly
[07:50:59] <Utils> Ok so I've got a problem which isn't easily duplicatable. Ok so I've got a textbox which I handle a keydown event, and if enter then I do xyz. Within that xyz, if the text is ap rivate message, to remember the recipient in the textbox. so straight after i handle it, i enter it back in.
[07:51:21] <Utils> This is kind of 50/50. Sometimes it appears to work so fast that both inputs are handleda t the same time.
[07:53:38] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: This selector does work.
[07:53:53] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/hotuvuyi/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:54:05] <Utils> I don't understand how it works. I wonder if I can duplicate it on jsfiddle but I doubt it but I can show what I do via it.
[07:54:48] <BillCriswell> Utils: Are you sure the form it's in isn't submitting?
[07:56:11] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: Are you changing the value synamically?
[07:56:15] <BillCriswell> dynamically?
[07:56:52] <BillCriswell> Cause an attribute selector would look at the value when the page was loaded, not what it's currently set at if I'm not mistaken.
[07:56:57] <BillCriswell> mistaking.
[07:57:00] <BillCriswell> Tense is stupid.
[07:59:55] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: that's very confusing, but yes that's what I'm doing
[08:00:21] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: I think you'll have to use filter() with this.value since that gets the inputs value property and not the attribute.
[08:01:28] <dmsuperman> grrr, that's going to cause a rewrite because this has already been factored out into a more modular solution
[08:01:32] <dmsuperman> thanks for helping investigate BillCriswell
[08:01:42] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:02:22] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: You can write your own selector to look at the value property if you wanted to.
[08:03:58] <Utils> BillCriswell: There is no form involved. http://jsfiddle.net/b4B9B/3/ this is what I do more or less. I send data through a socket connection and use different objects but this is the process. Ok so this doesn't actually repeat (or it might, idk it's a 5% chance), but if you type a message eginning with 'a', then it will autofill it. However sometimes, hard to duplicate the issue, it will also send 'a' despite only hitting the enter key rapidly fast.
[08:04:22] <Utils> The idea is I want to save the previous user such as: "/msg nickname: " so that it's easy to continuing private messaging if it's a conversation.
[08:04:43] <Utils> I can add a delay, but it's often flickery and that isnt' the desired affect.
[08:08:07] <ciqsteve> Q: need a recomendation for a table plugin
[08:09:36] <nCrazed> nhTable is nice, but that's angular :|
[08:10:08] <ciqsteve> nCr..in the future maybe..
[08:10:12] <ciqsteve> thx tho
[08:10:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Know how you'd go about getting a selector used... like say you wanted to do $('input:val("foo")')
[08:11:11] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: How would I write my own selector?
[08:11:24] <decx> is :val a thing?
[08:11:24] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: Figuring that out now cause I'm curious haha
[08:11:30] <decx> or do you mean how to write an expression
[08:11:31] <BillCriswell> decx: No, custom.
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/nobibawi/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:11:59] <BillCriswell> here so far, but not sure how to get the :val("foo") part.
[08:12:22] <BillCriswell> I mean.. I know it was selected with the :val selector obviously but the stuff after it I have no idea.
[08:12:39] <decx> hm
[08:13:53] <BillCriswell> decx: I can't think of a way haha.
[08:14:01] <decx> how does contain and not do it
[08:14:50] <BillCriswell> I'll have to look that up.
[08:15:59] <phoenixsun> decx: html is generated by JS does it affect the CSS? Are the styles still inherited?
[08:16:38] <BillCriswell> decx: I still suck at navigating the source.
[08:19:19] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: function(obj, index, meta) {
[08:19:33] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: meta[3] seems to contain the text inside the parens
[08:19:44] <dmsuperman> meta[3] seems rather arbitrary though
[08:19:50] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: Niice.
[08:19:55] <dmsuperman> meta[0] and meta[1] are both "val" and meta[1] is ""
[08:20:17] <decx> aaw too late
[08:20:29] <decx> i stacked arguments onto the function until i got the text ^^
[08:20:48] <dmsuperman> http://jsbin.com/lacotoke/1/edit
[08:20:50] <decx> phoenixsun doesnt matter css still applies
[08:21:34] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: Sweet. About what I cam eup with.
[08:22:02] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: I'd run it on some unsuspecting elements to make sure it doesn't do anything weird.
[08:23:34] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: http://jsbin.com/nobibawi/2/edit
[08:24:22] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: the only oddity I'm seeing is that :val("") doesn't work as expected, it looks for value='""'
[08:24:28] <dmsuperman> you have to do :val()
[08:24:53] <BillCriswell> What are you expecting that to do?
[08:25:00] <dmsuperman> match an empty input
[08:25:07] <decx> i prefer a filter on a specific context instead of selector expressions
[08:25:22] <dmsuperman> well decx the way my app is configured is that the selector comes from another piece of code
[08:25:34] <dmsuperman> so to replace it with filters it would require rewriting all the different modules configurations
[08:29:51] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: The empty thing should be easy enough to work around.
[08:31:02] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: Yeah I'll just check for "" or '' the whole thing just seems rather arbitrary
[08:31:08] <dmsuperman> not very clean
[08:31:33] <BillCriswell> Selecting inputs by value seems pretty weird to me in the first place haha
[08:33:54] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: it's an bit of JS that needs to be extremely decoupled from the HTML... it's a file uploader that needs to have a "remove" button that clears the input
[08:34:07] <dmsuperman> and there's no guarantee that the input will have any particular id or class so by value is the only sure way to look it up
[08:34:30] <decx> cant you traverse there
[08:35:03] <dmsuperman> traverse?
[08:35:09] <dmsuperman> you mean look it up by a parent?
[08:35:42] <decx> from the removebutton
[08:35:45] <dmsuperman> no control over parent nodes either. It could be rewritten of course but it's better for the app for the JS to be the super flexible side
[08:36:02] <dmsuperman> No guarantee the remove button will be in the same place either hah. it's very convoluted and roundabout
[08:36:16] <decx> this is where i slowly back off
[08:36:18] <decx> ^^
[08:36:34] <dmsuperman> yeah no worries, as I said javascript is the putty in this case
[08:37:02] <dmsuperman> that's why I love JS, you can write powerful applications in it, or you can just use it like gum and paper clips when it suits it
[08:37:08] <dmsuperman> the app is better for it this way
[08:37:17] <dmsuperman> the JS is just a little scary hah
[08:38:06] <decx> BillCriswell i already got a new client where i can use that parallazy css
[08:38:13] <decx> doing cool shit pays off ^^
[08:38:38] <gizmore> How do i get mobile devices show "next" button for form inputs?
[08:39:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah it's definitely nice when that happens.
[08:39:50] <decx> and i dont even have to do anything, they got an artist to create assets
[08:40:50] <decx> well the artist is shit, so maybe i can get some design money afterwards if it doesnt look as good as with the good assets i used for the demo
[08:40:53] <decx> ^^
[08:41:44] <decx> what's with artists and designers substituting craftsmanship with minimalism
[08:41:55] <decx> not that i'm going on a rant but....
[08:42:26] <BillCriswell> I have no idea.
[08:43:05] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: I'm not having any issues with empty strings.
[08:44:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Designers are weird.
[08:45:17] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: http://jsbin.com/fidab/2/edit?html,js,output
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> Just noticed you can "flick" in Chrome's touch screen emulation.
[08:46:58] <decx> i literally got a couple of word scribbles that should be used for headlines
[08:47:30] <BillCriswell> Ick.
[08:47:49] <decx> like if you'd write a word not with your primary hand
[08:48:26] <decx> must be the equivalent to help-vampires in coding
[08:48:27] <BillCriswell> I did that when I got arrested one time... not sure why.
[08:48:51] <decx> you got arrested?
[08:48:57] <BillCriswell> Multiple times.
[08:49:06] <decx> how
[08:49:35] <BillCriswell> I was like 16 at a public swimming pool. My friends and I bought swords to have sword fights. The management didn't appreciate it.
[08:50:07] <decx> how do you get arrested for that
[08:50:19] <decx> oh right ,america
[08:50:23] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:50:27] <BillCriswell> The second time I was skating in a "Zero Tolerance" area.
[08:50:42] <BillCriswell> Underage drinking....
[08:50:48] <BillCriswell> What else...
[08:50:51] <decx> so all bullshit stuff
[08:51:00] <BillCriswell> Oh we destroyed an abandoned car.
[08:51:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, never anything good.
[08:51:25] <decx> i did all that and many times police got called but they would never actually arrest someone for this stuff
[08:51:41] <BillCriswell> They do it here haha.
[08:52:11] <BillCriswell> One time when I just turned 21 I had a party and of course a lot of my friends were a little under 21 and everyone got lucked up.
[08:52:15] <decx> the closest thing i had to an arrest was when they confiscated my harddrive because we used login data from an internet cafe to surf for free
[08:52:25] <BillCriswell> I could have gotten jail time for that but I think they actually understood.
[08:52:29] <decx> back in the 90s ^^
[08:52:43] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice. I haven't done anything illegal with computers really.
[08:53:07] <decx> there was a scene for reals (stolen login data) and fakes (new isps not knowing how to deal with fake data)
[08:53:07] <BillCriswell> I got into someones email for a friend before... but that's only because they were dumb and had terrible security questions.
[08:53:35] <decx> back when you paid by the minute
[08:53:41] <BillCriswell> Hahaha.
[08:53:57] <BillCriswell> I still remember the question "Who was your childhood hero?"
[08:54:19] <BillCriswell> and I named each Ninja Turtle and "michelangelo" was right.
[08:54:27] <decx> lol
[08:55:01] <decx> all these personal security questions become increasingly dangerous with facebook
[08:55:06] <no1youknow> Hi guys. Has anyone ever stumbled upon this kind of toolbar that somehow appears to me at the bottom of the browser window in a particular site when I have the focus on a textarea and accidentally click on the "\" (slash) key? I find it really weird and it's happening to me on a particular site both on Chrome v26.x and IE 10. Here's the screenshot: i.imgur.com/p2ZUfJP.png. Thanks in advance.
[08:55:08] <BillCriswell> Definitely.
[08:55:22] <Utils> BillCriswell: figured it out. it wasn't unbinding the events (I didn't atually execute the unbind-events function as I should have done) so it was listening twice on keypress, hence the duplication.
[08:55:26] <Utils> all done now tho
[08:55:47] <BillCriswell> Utils: Niiice.
[08:55:56] <BillCriswell> decx: I make up shit for mine.
[08:56:28] <BillCriswell> "Where were you born?" "Mali"
[08:56:52] <decx> and then they ask you that when you call in for support
[08:57:04] <decx> what's the name of your first pet: monsterschlong
[08:57:10] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[08:57:21] <decx> should i spell? m-o-n....
[09:02:28] <BillCriswell> I fear for my browser whenever I click a link to a site from facebook.
[09:02:44] <duch_kazatel> redireeeect!
[09:03:41] <BillCriswell> How do these sites get any traffic with the amount of shit they pile on.
[09:03:59] <duch_kazatel> you clicked the link didn't you?
[09:04:18] <BillCriswell> I did. ='(
[09:15:45] <no1youknow> Hi guys. Has anyone ever stumbled upon this kind of toolbar that somehow appears to me at the bottom of the browser window in a particular site when I have the focus on a textarea and accidentally click on the "\" (slash) key? I find it really weird and it's happening to me on a particular site both on Chrome v26.x and IE 10. Here's the screenshot: i.imgur.com/p2ZUfJP.png. Thanks in advance.
[09:16:20] <duch_kazatel> what's the site?
[09:17:05] <BillCriswell> You must have entered god mode.
[09:17:26] <Uhkis> one could pull that up on some site with konami code
[09:19:03] <thebope> yep
[09:19:06] <thebope> definitely god mode
[09:19:21] <thebope> who else could delete that zone?
[09:19:29] <thebope> haha the konami code worked on reddit for a time
[09:19:50] <Uhkis> what did it do
[09:19:56] <BillCriswell> There used to be a directory of sites that did something when you entered it. Too lazy too google.
[09:20:06] <no1youknow> seriously, I'm thinking it might be some kind of spyware but it's weird because it happens on two different PCs but not on a third. And it seems really fishy.
[09:20:31] <duch_kazatel> no1youknow there's really no way for us to know unless you send us the site.
[09:20:31] <BillCriswell> http://konamicodesites.com/ ah, celever
[09:20:36] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: still exists, really outdated though
[09:20:56] <duch_kazatel> combine that with Raptorize and you're good to go.
[09:21:36] <BillCriswell> no1youknow: Inspect the element see where the forms link back to and all that shit.
[09:22:54] <no1youknow> the site is http://pplware.sapo.pt/truques-dicas/ja-pode-usar-o-bing-de-forma-integrada-no-chrome-saiba-como/ (for example). Just scroll all the way down and then in the textarea, clicking on the slash triggers that bar in my case. It's not related to programming, by the way. I just thought web devs might have had a better chance of seeing it before than most other people.
[09:23:41] <duch_kazatel> i had to do a pipe  character
[09:24:03] <Uhkis>  WebSpectator 3.4.89 (124807.998)
[09:24:18] <alphis> can jquery do fileuploads to a form?
[09:24:23] <alphis> doesn't seem to be working for me
[09:24:27] <no1youknow> and what's that supposed to be, I wonder?
[09:24:52] <Uhkis> WebSpectator: The Power Solution for Realtime Advertising
[09:25:52] <Uhkis> google is your friend
[09:25:55] <Uhkis> unless you're facebook
[09:26:07] <duch_kazatel> and even then it's your friend.
[09:26:10] <Uhkis> or any government
[09:26:24] <alphis> lol
[09:26:28] <alphis> google and govt are buds
[09:27:22] <no1youknow> Uhkis: yeah, you're right ;) . Silly me, didn't even think about looking at the source code before rushing to Google and IRC :s
[09:34:27] <Engin> $('foo>bar') works great it returns a jq object wrapper around selection... can I just get the innerHTML of the eleents as an array?
[09:34:44] <Engin> I mean is there a sweet way or should I do it manually?
[09:34:53] <duch_kazatel> Engin with extra effort - why are you going for that?
[09:37:06] <Engin> i'm gonna fetch some values from a table to compute something
[09:37:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's a manual thing then.
[09:40:41] <ericx2x> Can someone tell me how I make it so that these elements are always visisble even when I expand my menu? jsfiddle.net/jve34/1/

[09:41:22] <ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/jve34/1/
[09:41:30] <duch_kazatel> 404s all around.
[09:41:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/jve34/ works
[09:42:43] <ericx2x> sorry this one: http://jsfiddle.net/8YG4S/
[09:42:43] <duch_kazatel> which elements?
[09:42:51] <ericx2x> those are all bad links besides this one http://jsfiddle.net/8YG4S/
[09:42:53] <ericx2x> sorry about that
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> that latest one doesn't work at all.
[09:43:38] <ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/8YG4S/1/
[09:43:38] <duch_kazatel> including jquery fixes it.
[09:43:41] <ericx2x> yea
[09:43:44] <ericx2x> soryr @_@
[09:43:46] <frank_o> Hello! Anybody know why jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/) breaks iScroll 5 (http://iscrolljs.com/) when emulating a mobile device in Chrome? Works fine when there's no emulation: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/7aWAg/show
[09:43:47] <duch_kazatel> remove the height: 300px;
[09:44:19] <ericx2x> duch_kazatel: okay but how do i make sure it can never go past a certain height?
[09:44:33] <duch_kazatel> max-height
[09:45:08] <duch_kazatel> unless what you want is to scroll the submenus if there's not enough space vertically.,
[09:45:46] <ericx2x> duch_kazatel: okay but if i use that those elements still scroll off
[09:45:53] <ericx2x> i need them to always be visisble
[09:46:00] <duch_kazatel> then you need to better define what you want to have happen.
[09:46:40] <ericx2x> Basically I want those elements to always be visisble but I also want there to be a maximum height that the menu itself can expand to
[09:47:01] <duch_kazatel> i get that part - what do you want to have happen when the menu exceeds that height?
[09:47:06] <duch_kazatel> should the submenus scroll instead?
[09:47:10] <ericx2x> yes
[09:47:12] <ericx2x> exactly
[09:47:18] <duch_kazatel> then set a max-height on those instead,
[09:50:01] <ericx2x> Thank you duch_kazatel
[09:50:09] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:54:19] <in_deep_thought> can I put !â€™s in my div ids? like <button id = â€˜button!â€™>button text</button> and then call them with like $(â€˜buttonâ€™) ?
[09:54:37] <in_deep_thought> I mean $(â€˜#button!â€™)
[09:54:52] <in_deep_thought> button is a strange word
[09:56:46] <duch_kazatel> in HTML5, yes, but that's a terrible idea.
[09:57:10] <in_deep_thought> duch_kazatel: why is that a bad idea?
[09:59:56] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: It doesn't really add anything useful to the name.
[09:59:57] <duch_kazatel> why would you put an exclamation mark in an ID?
[10:01:01] <in_deep_thought> to make it more unique. just button doesnâ€™t describe it as well
[10:01:08] <duch_kazatel> use words.
[10:01:12] <duch_kazatel> not special chars.
[10:01:19] <in_deep_thought> ok
[10:01:38] <duch_kazatel> #buttonToSpawnRaptors
[10:02:48] <BillCriswell> $('#buttonToSpawnRaptors').prop('disabled', true);
[10:02:49] <BillCriswell> phew.
[10:06:58] <duch_kazatel> long names are good.
[10:07:01] <duch_kazatel> short names are not.
[10:07:06] <duch_kazatel> well, not inherently good.
[10:08:18] <alaing> evening ppl
[10:08:26] <duch_kazatel> good morning.
[10:17:45] <frank_o> Anybody know why jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/) breaks iScroll 5 (http://iscrolljs.com/) when emulating a mobile device in Chrome?
[10:17:48] <frank_o> Works fine when disabling the touch gestures part of Chrome's mobile emulation, or when running no emulation at all: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/7aWAg/show
[10:20:41] <lancelot> Hi !
[10:21:41] <duch_kazatel> hello
[10:21:58] <lancelot> I didnâ€™t find something on Google to my problem, I wanted to know if thereâ€™s a solution to do something like that : http://0bin.net/paste/e+cNbAMZvLt8DekS#lcPjyUQ-XUL/hAC11ZAYy/70L45MwytY4OiVjhW3Z7Q (10 loc). Thanks!
[10:22:22] <duch_kazatel> gug?
[10:22:43] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[10:23:44] <duch_kazatel> set it up in http://jsfiddle.net/ :)
[10:24:33] <martixy> Small question: Am I correct in assuming that $("selector:first") stops early and $("selector").first() first gets the entire set and then reduces it to its first element (therefore making the former always better when available) ?
[10:24:54] <duch_kazatel> nope :)
[10:25:24] <martixy> So what's the difference?
[10:25:27] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[10:26:15] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to dump into the source, but it's not as simple as that.
[10:26:17] <martixy> So the latter is best?
[10:26:28] <duch_kazatel> .filter() is best/.
[10:26:35] <martixy> Ah....
[10:26:43] <martixy> Right. How counterintuitive :)
[10:26:47] <duch_kazatel> "Because :first is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :first cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. To achieve the best performance when using :first to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":first")."
[10:26:49] <duch_kazatel> not if you read the docs.
[10:26:54] <lancelot> duch_kazatel : Thanks! I have few <tables>, with elements which have the same class. I want to do something var selector = â€˜#table_pitcher > â€™; $(selector + â€˜.locationâ€™); But, I want to apply this to something arround 200 lines of code. I wanted to know if thereâ€™s something easier to do modify all the selectors. :)
[10:27:33] <duch_kazatel> still not sure what you're trying to do.  could you please set up a simplified fiddle?
[10:29:22] <alphis> can jquery do fileuploads to a form?
[10:29:35] <duch_kazatel> alphis forms can handle that, yes.
[10:29:49] <duch_kazatel> no jquery needed.
[10:32:32] <duch_kazatel> martixy for more info - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/bcca4f041b4c98dc9cb127ea3a2a7f40d2db4796/external/sizzle/dist/sizzle.js#L118 and http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:32:51] <martixy> Sweet
[10:33:26] <duch_kazatel> basically, use jquery methods to reduce your set, instead of selectors.
[10:33:36] <duch_kazatel> and don't do things like div#theId.
[10:34:21] <lancelot> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/RE4MJ/ :)
[10:35:46] <duch_kazatel> lancelot that's not going to happen for you.
[10:35:55] <duch_kazatel> but there's a different way to approach this.
[10:36:28] <duch_kazatel> you could have one handler for all of these, instead of one for each different one.
[10:40:38] <alphis> duch_kazatel: forms sure. but can i do it ajax style with jquery
[10:40:50] <alphis> the way i post user data like checkboxes etc
[10:41:05] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery ajax fileupload
[10:41:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: javascript - jQuery Ajax File Upload - Stack Overflow â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2320069/jquery-ajax-file-upload
[10:41:24] <lancelot> duch_kazatel: Okay, thanks ! :)
[10:41:40] <alphis> yeah i've seen this
[10:41:47] <stoned> hola, que pso
[10:41:53] <alphis> iframe isn't exactly what i had in mind
[10:41:57] <stoned>  caption: $("textarea[name='']")., this is a valid css selector
[10:42:00] <alphis> but if its the way...
[10:42:03] <stoned> havn't done any js/front end in years
[10:42:10] <stoned> is the quoting ok?
[10:42:12] <alphis> likewise
[10:42:23] <alphis> looks good
[10:42:25] <duch_kazatel> alphis i'm being kind of flippant - google would be your friend in this case.
[10:42:26] <stoned> coo, thanks
[10:42:33] <alphis> np
[10:42:44] <alphis> duch_kazatel: i was hoping i could submit it the same way as i submit everything else
[10:42:48] <stoned> that piano playing aj still around?
[10:42:48] <alphis> ill just not use ajax for file uploads
[10:42:49] <stoned> :D
[10:42:59] <stoned> ajpiano, o/ guess whose back!
[10:43:01] <duch_kazatel> alphis you can use ajax for it.
[10:43:06] <alphis> i dont want to deal with frames and xhr html5 only solutions ;/
[10:43:14] <duch_kazatel> errr...
[10:43:25] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to use XHR for ajax, since, y'know...
[10:43:38] <stoned> hey, to get the text content of a textarea, I do .value() ?
[10:43:39] <alphis> With XHR2, File upload through AJAX is supported. E.g. through FormData object, but unfortunately it is not supported by all/old browsers.
[10:43:42] <alphis> so
[10:43:43] <alphis> yeha
[10:43:46] <stoned> ok
[10:43:47] <duch_kazatel> stoned .val()
[10:43:49] <stoned> ah
[10:44:16] <duch_kazatel> lancelot http://jsfiddle.net/RE4MJ/1/
[10:44:18] <stoned> this is my js: caption: $("textarea[name='facebook']").val(),
[10:44:20] <duch_kazatel> something like this instead.
[10:44:27] <stoned> hm.
[10:45:26] <martixy> hey duch, it says more specificity on the right hand side, but what about a single selector - which is best: tag.class or just .class
[10:45:41] <duch_kazatel> just .class when you can.
[10:45:42] <lancelot> duch_kazatel: waw, nice! Thanks a lot, thatâ€™s awesome!
[10:45:50] <alphis> how can i disable a button
[10:46:01] <alphis> $(this).disable() doesn't seem to work
[10:46:10] <duch_kazatel> .prop('disabled', true)
[10:46:10] <alphis> in onclick handler for button that is
[10:46:30] <alphis> .prop()? when do you use .prop vs attr() ?
[10:46:34] <alphis> and whats the diff
[10:46:37] <duch_kazatel> never use .attr()
[10:46:40] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[10:46:40] <alphis> (i hope its not artibrary)
[10:47:02] <duch_kazatel> .prop() is the actual underlying DOM content, .attr() is the html.  you want the former.
[10:47:40] <alphis> ah
[10:47:42] <alphis> interesting
[10:47:54] <alphis> how does .prop("disabled", true); change it tho
[10:47:59] <alphis> whats the html look like
[10:48:03] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't.
[10:48:10] <duch_kazatel> you don't care about the HTML, you care about the DOM.
[10:48:14] <alphis> also.... why is there a disabled property instead of an enabled
[10:48:26] <duch_kazatel> because the default state is "enabled"
[10:48:26] <alphis> ok so i guess the browser just disables it somehow
[10:48:40] <duch_kazatel> the DOM marks it as disabled and visually updates accordingly.
[10:48:44] <alphis> default state being enabled sounds like a good reason to set it disabled by setting enabled to false
[10:49:21] <duch_kazatel> alphis because of a quirk, the actual way to disable a button is to do <button disabled></button>
[10:49:29] <duch_kazatel> the presence of the attribute determines it.
[10:49:59] <duch_kazatel> due to a quirk in the way javascript and jquery work, that's kind of a funky thing to do - add an attribute that doesn't = anything.
[10:50:15] <duch_kazatel> so we do .prop('disabled', true) to flip the switch instead.
[11:07:14] <PantsOfChoco> wieners
[11:09:06] <duch_kazatel> and/or butts
[11:10:39] <DeliriumTremens> apparently jqplot charts don't like being placed in jqmodal divs
[11:11:04] <duch_kazatel> probably a cloning issue.
[11:11:56] <DeliriumTremens> looks like jqplot wants to set the class over the class jqmodal uses
[11:12:14] <thebope> When I have a select menu, how do I put the word "options" or something which is not an option but describes what the select menu represents
[11:12:17] <thebope> ?
[11:12:18] <duch_kazatel> put the jqplot as a child of the modal box
[11:12:23] <DeliriumTremens> i tried that
[11:12:35] <DeliriumTremens> it sets the class on the child div, but doesn't place the chart inside of it
[11:12:52] <duch_kazatel> try initing after the modal launches.
[11:13:44] <duch_kazatel> thebope you mean a <label>?
[11:14:00] <thebope> yea, does that work?
[11:14:12] <duch_kazatel> why wouldn't it?
[11:14:40] <thebope> but I don't want it to be an option that can get transferred to the server
[11:14:48] <thebope> I guess I can do a check for it onsubmit
[11:14:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:14:55] <duch_kazatel> the label isn't a child of the option element
[11:14:59] <BillCriswell> thebope: You can use an optgroup maybe?
[11:15:05] <duch_kazatel> optgroup won't display by default.
[11:15:16] <thebope> oh thats true
[11:15:17] <thebope> hmm
[11:15:19] <BillCriswell> I forget the attribute.. is it like label or something?
[11:15:30] <thebope> Can I just put a label tag in a select menu?
[11:15:34] <thebope> I didn't know that either
[11:15:37] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:15:39] <duch_kazatel> you can't do that.
[11:16:10] <thebope> yea
[11:16:19] <thebope> I'll try optgroup maybe
[11:16:27] <duch_kazatel> you probably want
[11:16:28] <duch_kazatel>  <option value="" disabled selected>Select your option</option>
[11:16:45] <BillCriswell> Ah, duh, forgot about disabled lol
[11:17:08] <BillCriswell> thebope: What duch_kazatel is saying should be what you're looking for.. if it's more for grouping theres: http://jsbin.com/geceg/1/edit
[11:17:12] <duch_kazatel> it's awkward in this case because it's the default option, so it's technically selected, but y'know...
[11:17:39] <thebope> ahh I see yea
[11:17:47] <thebope> yea I'll just have to do a small check with javascript
[11:17:53] <duch_kazatel> yep
[11:17:59] <thebope> if .val() == "default option" yada yada
[11:18:04] <thebope> thanks guys
[11:18:08] <thebope> I'll be back in a few minutes
[11:18:09] <duch_kazatel> you could also setup a validator.
[11:18:11] <thebope> have to run to a meeting
[11:18:15] <duch_kazatel> good times.
[11:18:20] <thebope> hat emeetings
[11:18:21] <thebope> haha
[11:18:22] <thebope> hate*
[11:18:26] <thebope> a validator?
[11:18:28] <BillCriswell> I love hat e-meetings.
[11:18:39] <thebope> hahaha
[11:18:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah, verify each input is valid.
[11:18:55] <thebope> I saw HTML5 is adding a required attribute for selects which is kind of cool
[11:19:02] <thebope> yea, I'll do client and server side checks
[11:19:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah, but not reliable for old IE>
[11:19:17] <thebope> yea no, nothing html5 is good for old IE
[11:19:25] <thebope> basically its just redundancy at this point I suppose
[11:19:27] <thebope> okay be back
[11:19:28] <thebope> Q
[11:19:31] <thebope> woops
[11:19:31] <thebope> !
[11:19:33] <thebope> thanks
[11:20:11] <drej> thebope well
[11:20:22] <drej> its good to use html5 and all its modern implementations
[11:20:34] <drej> and its easy to supliment the missing functionality in older IE with polyfills
[11:20:38] <drej> which are just drop-in replacements
[11:21:44] <Spami> Any idea why this code actually send a GET request instead of POST: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c14c93bc0e9073ff6d77
[11:22:06] <Spami> I'm getting this on my server log: Started GET "/api/v2/public/ab_test" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-24 11:15:55 -0700
[11:25:50] <BillCriswell> Spami: I have no idea. Could the request be redirecting to GET or something?
[11:26:21] <Spami> BillCriswell, may be, it's odd any way I could check that ?
[11:26:57] <decx> you should still see the post in your server logs
[11:27:06] <BillCriswell> Spami: You can look at the Network tab in the dev tools and see if there's anything fucky going on.
[11:27:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah good point.
[11:27:35] <Spami> In that case, I only see a GET
[11:27:50] <BillCriswell> Any reason someone may have made ajax only use GET through modifying jquery? lol
[11:28:00] <BillCriswell> or maybe some weird ajaxSettings somewhere.
[11:28:15] <Spami> Ah
[11:28:21] <Spami> I have a clue!
[11:28:28] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeet.
[11:28:43] <decx> i'm singing the blue clues song
[11:28:46] <decx> s*
[11:28:57] <BillCriswell> I wish we were really smart.
[11:29:09] <BillCriswell> Steve was very optimistic.
[11:29:37] <duch_kazatel> i'm remembering that south park "hardly boys" episode
[11:30:02] <Spami> That's some fucked shit: http://cl.ly/image/0m0S1I1B1J0p
[11:30:05] <BillCriswell> I faintly remember that one.
[11:31:55] <BillCriswell> Spami: Looks tricky.
[11:32:21] <decx> oh so it's an error with the data you send
[11:32:33] <decx> would think the server still logged a failed post though
[11:32:47] <Spami> decx, pretty sure it's the controller
[11:33:01] <BillCriswell> It's probably one of those NEoGeo ones.
[11:33:41] <BillCriswell> or a Power Glove.
[11:34:14] <decx> who doesnt want to be like
[11:34:17] <decx> lucas

[11:35:57] <decx> that's lucas
[11:36:06] <decx> he should have never put away that powerglove
[11:38:03] <BillCriswell> Haha
[11:43:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Found a dude I went to high school with on here. Blah
[11:45:23] <frank_o> Hey! When emulating a mobile device in Google Chrome---why does iScroll scrolling break after jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/) has finished embedding my SoundCloud tracks?
[11:45:27] <frank_o> If I disable the touch gestures part of Chrome's mobile emulation, scrolling works again. Or when I disable mobile emulation altogether. Testcase: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/7aWAg/show
[11:59:41] <duch_kazatel> frank_o sounds like you need to talk to the folks that maintain iScroll
[12:00:36] <drej> frank_o
[12:00:42] <drej> its 2014, you dont need iScroll
[12:00:43] <drej> lol
[12:01:05] <Velveeta_> androidScroll ftw!
[12:01:12] * Velveeta_ outb4flamewar
[12:01:13] <drej> or just ... css
[12:01:14] <drej> you know
[12:03:10] <BillCriswell> I'm not giving my visitors a predictable experience.
[12:03:11] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: That's probably a good idea
[12:03:23] <drej> frank_o seriously, though, why are you using iscroll ?
[12:03:29] <drej> there's nothing that it gives you that you need these days
[12:03:31] <frank_o> drej: CSS works very badly with jQuery Mobile
[12:03:43] * drej blinks
[12:04:11] <frank_o> It's on their todo list though
[12:04:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:04:36] <duch_kazatel> "css works very badly with a thing that uses css"
[12:05:06] <drej> im not touching that one any more
[12:05:08] * drej steps away
[12:05:46] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Yup overflow scrolling does not go well with jQM right now
[12:06:02] <duch_kazatel> then the issue is with overflow: scroll; not CSS.
[12:06:26] <frank_o> I stand corrected
[12:07:06] <drej> well
[12:07:24] <drej> im dubious about categorically stating "overflow: scroll doesnt work"
[12:07:25] <drej> :)
[12:07:41] <DannyFritz> i'm having a problem with mouseleave not being called when i leave the dom element
[12:08:11] <duch_kazatel> i would be, too.
[12:08:19] <duch_kazatel> but at least he's being more specific about the problem now ;)
[12:08:58] <DannyFritz> is anyone familiar with common mouseleave gotchas? or should i cook a jsfiddle up?
[12:09:09] <decx> yes
[12:09:35] <BillCriswell> Where's my Yosemite beta god dammit.
[12:09:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/FhbpQ/ DannyFritz
[12:09:42] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple.
[12:09:48] <duch_kazatel> make sure you have things cased correctly.
[12:11:06] <decx> why is it pronounced yo-sam-at-e and not yo-semite
[12:11:31] <BillCriswell> decx: I have no idea.
[12:11:34] <duch_kazatel> *yo-sehm-eht-tee"
[12:11:55] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: if you move your mouse kind of quickly over this, you'll notice bugs http://jsfiddle.net/FhbpQ/1/
[12:11:57] <duch_kazatel> and probably because it's a native american or spanish name.
[12:12:10] <BillCriswell> DannyFritz: http://jsfiddle.net/FhbpQ/2/ I can't get this to go over 1
[12:12:39] <BillCriswell> DannyFritz: Can't replicate that.
[12:12:41] <duch_kazatel> works fine for me.
[12:13:09] <decx> well there is mouseout
[12:13:15] <DannyFritz> i can't get it to go over 1 either, but sometimes my mouse isn't on it and it displays: 1
[12:13:19] <decx> i always forget what's the difference
[12:13:29] <DannyFritz> mouseout bubbles the event
[12:14:17] <DannyFritz> look at where my mouse is duch_kazatel http://i.imgur.com/RxG7K4H.png
[12:14:41] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[12:14:45] <duch_kazatel> i couldn't get that to happen
[12:14:45] <decx> looks to me like you've got cursor gremlins
[12:15:08] <DannyFritz> it only happens if i have child elements
[12:15:14] <DannyFritz> so something is happening with bubbling
[12:15:44] <duch_kazatel> ah-hah.
[12:15:46] <duch_kazatel> just got it.
[12:16:12] <duch_kazatel> i had to quickly go over the child element instea.d
[12:16:26] * Velveeta_ throws water on the cursor gremlins.
[12:16:33] <DannyFritz> yeah, something weird happens and it doesn't fire the mouseleave event
[12:16:38] <duch_kazatel> cursor gremlins it is.
[12:16:43] * Velveeta_ hands the gremlins a regular expression.
[12:16:50] <Velveeta_> now you've got N+1 problems
[12:16:51] <duch_kazatel> wonder if it's an acceleration/rendering thing.
[12:17:16] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: also sometimes it highlights the span red. so definitely a bubbling problem
[12:17:33] <BillCriswell> Damn, the hospital down the street from my mom's just had a shooting.
[12:17:49] <drej> shit
[12:17:57] <drej> BillCriswell the states?
[12:18:08] <duch_kazatel> DannyFritz probably not, since i just did stopImmediatePropagation() against the event.
[12:18:08] <BillCriswell> drej: Yes.
[12:18:21] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: i think i fixed it with this http://jsfiddle.net/FhbpQ/3/
[12:18:23] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh shit :(
[12:18:29] <drej> BillCriswell sorry to hear that
[12:19:12] <BillCriswell> Yeah that's nuts.
[12:19:41] <BillCriswell> http://6abc.com/news/3-shot-on-delco-hospital-campus;-1-in-custody/216641/ shiiiiiit
[12:19:44] <duch_kazatel> in philly?
[12:19:52] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: yeah it works great now, but i'm still kind of confused about which targets it was firing the mouseleave event on
[12:20:04] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[12:20:08] <BillCriswell> This is like... 2 minutes outside of south west philly.
[12:20:26] <drej> fuck
[12:20:37] <dllama> hey guys, can anyone recommend a way to use waypoints inside a scrolling div?
[12:20:46] <drej> at first i was thinking "who would shoot up a hospital"
[12:20:57] <drej> but then i remembered that they charge $60k to sew back a finger
[12:21:00] <dllama> I have a submit button disabled on TOS until someone scrolls, but its not working if they use the actual scroll bar
[12:21:00] <drej> in the states
[12:21:06] <duch_kazatel> drej heh, yeah...
[12:21:19] <decx> so is she ok?
[12:21:22] <drej> dllama dont use waypoints, use scroll offset
[12:21:35] <BillCriswell> drej: True haha
[12:21:41] <dllama> drej: i tried, but that doesn't work when the user uses scroll bar on teh side
[12:21:48] <duch_kazatel> it should just fine.
[12:21:49] <drej> dllama sure it does
[12:21:54] <drej> dllama can you setup a test case ?
[12:21:58] <drej> in jsfiddle or something similar
[12:22:23] <dllama> drej: thats part of the isssue, for me it works perfectly fine, but my client shared screen with me, and for him it didnt fire,
[12:22:35] <duch_kazatel> what browser is the client in?
[12:22:55] <dllama> i'm on a mac using chrome and a trackpad to scroll, he's on windows, also used chrome but he used the scroll bar added into the div,
[12:23:19] <duch_kazatel> something seems off then.
[12:23:26] <duch_kazatel> i'm on windows - mind sharing a testcase?
[12:23:29] <dllama> though when i tried to replicate and used dragged the scroll bar on side of div rather than scroll THROUGH the div, i got same issue
[12:23:38] <dllama> i'm trying to setup jsfiddle now
[12:24:58] <drej> dllama what browser and such
[12:25:03] <dllama> i'm in chrome
[12:25:05] <drej> oh i misread
[12:25:07] <dllama> and so was client
[12:25:55] <dllama> its taking me a bit longer, trying to replicate environment
[12:27:11] <duch_kazatel> errr, any way you can just replicate the case?
[12:27:13] <duch_kazatel> and not everything?
[12:29:26] <dllama> duch_kazatel: thats what i'm trying to do,
[12:29:30] <dllama> in jsfiddle, typing it out
[12:29:34] <duch_kazatel> okay
[12:32:00] <decx> it's going to be the biggest fiddle of all time
[12:32:57] <duch_kazatel> apparently.
[12:33:13] <decx> the traffic will be a fiddle calamity for digital ocean
[12:33:35] <iamviknesh> how do i change the attribute's value of event source ?
[12:33:37] <adavia> does anyone ever used jssor slider?
[12:33:47] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh do what now
[12:33:56] <decx> you mean event target
[12:34:39] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: decx http://jsfiddle.net/richardwo/QKXVe/#fork
[12:34:46] <decx> looks to me like any old slider adavia
[12:35:00] <dllama> ughh, i can't get it to work in jsfiddle :/
[12:35:06] <dllama> its not even showing me the offset
[12:35:10] <duch_kazatel> wait this is a jquery mobile issue?
[12:35:11] <iamviknesh> when the list is clicked change the href value  of it
[12:35:14] <adavia> decx: what do you mean by ld
[12:35:16] <adavia> old
[12:35:35] <duch_kazatel> dllama also: http://jsfiddle.net/QKXVe/153/
[12:35:49] <decx> 'any old' is an expression for every other
[12:36:00] <duch_kazatel> "nothing special"
[12:36:02] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[12:37:18] <adavia> decx: is it possible the slider is not adjusting corectly on window resize http://adavia.w.pw/
[12:37:35] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: how can i do it ?
[12:37:57] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: finally figured out my problem. I just needed to use event.currentTarget.
[12:38:22] <dllama> http://jsfiddle.net/jSnJ2/ i'm having a lot of trouble getting that to work right now though
[12:38:46] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh lists don't have href.
[12:38:49] <duch_kazatel> <a> tags to.
[12:39:05] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: yeah i mean <a> tahe inside those list
[12:39:11] <duch_kazatel> use .prop('href', 'newURL') <- replace "newURL" with whatever you want
[12:39:16] <iamviknesh> s/tahe/tage
[12:39:35] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: ok thanks :)
[12:43:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell btw you'd be jealous i'm seeing journey live tomorrow.
[12:43:32] <decx> adavia i cant tell what's the problem there, seems coutnerintuitive to have the wrapper not at 100% but calculate a new width on resize
[12:44:36] <adavia> decx: actually the problem seems to be when i place the slider inside the bootstrap container
[12:44:49] <adavia> so i guess is bootstrap
[12:44:57] <adavia> cant figure it out why
[12:45:21] <decx> adavia width: 100%; overflow: hidden on the #slider_index gets rid of the horizontal scrollbar at 320px viewport width
[12:45:36] <decx> also i hate that explode transition
[12:47:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That is unfortunate.
[12:47:41] <decx> i thought people only like journey ironically?
[12:47:47] <duch_kazatel> you'd be surprised.
[12:47:59] <duch_kazatel> i mean, Neal Schon is a decent guitarist, but i just don't "get it"
[12:48:04] <decx> i actually know no songs, only that one from scrubs
[12:48:19] <duch_kazatel> my band plays three journey tunes right now, and I only really like one of them.
[12:48:57] <duch_kazatel> and by "really like" I mean "sort of enjoy"
[12:49:25] <BillCriswell> decx: You've heard one Journey song you've heard them all.
[12:49:29] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: i wrote like this ---> $(event.target).prop('href', 'www.google.com') , but i get error loading page
[12:49:53] <duch_kazatel> you want  $(this).prop('href', 'http://www.google.com');
[12:51:56] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: even that dint work :(
[12:52:04] <duch_kazatel> show me your code then.
[12:52:38] <iamviknesh> even event.target would refer to same <a> right
[12:52:53] <iamviknesh> http://jsfiddle.net/richardwo/QKXVe/#fork
[12:52:54] <duch_kazatel> people use $(this) as a matter of convention.
[12:53:03] <decx> BillCriswell thought you were exaggerating but i clicked through a couple of videos and it certainly rings true
[12:53:10] <duch_kazatel> most of their songs yeah.
[12:53:14] <duch_kazatel> lights is okay.
[12:53:27] <decx> but i had janes addiction in the related videos so i got that going for me
[12:53:30] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: line 12 in js :)
[12:54:01] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh event.target wouldn't work because you're not passing the event object.
[12:54:20] <duch_kazatel> hence http://jsfiddle.net/QKXVe/154/
[12:54:36] <duch_kazatel> also, what you're trying to do will never work on jsfiddle.
[12:54:38] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: it should be e.target :)
[12:54:44] <iamviknesh> why ?
[12:54:56] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh you're not passing the event object, so you cannot get the target.
[12:55:02] <dllama> guys, so any suggestion on how to fix offset when used with scrollbar on overflow auto?
[12:55:12] <duch_kazatel> and look at your console - google diables CORS, so you can't load content into that iframe.
[12:55:43] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh if you don't pass the event object to the click handler, you can never do e.target or event.target.  $(this) will work just fine.
[12:55:46] <duch_kazatel> and with that, lunch.
[12:57:45] <iamviknesh> duch_lunch: i did , but dint update :(
[13:12:12] <BillCriswell> Did websites all get terrible at the same time?
[13:12:21] <BillCriswell> or is chrome pooping the bed.
[13:12:26] <BillCriswell> Wonder what the issue is.
[13:12:30] <decx> yes
[13:13:07] <BillCriswell> I don't know. Both.
[13:16:13] <drej> is there anything that $.ajax is doing that xhr would not do in respect to sending up large amounts of base64 data
[13:16:29] <drej> we have a singular image we're base64 encoding, and in a vanilla XHR it keeps timing out during upload
[13:16:34] <drej> but with jquery $.ajax
[13:24:16] <drej> ... its fine
[13:24:16] <drej> lol
[13:24:24] <drej> i forgot to finish the sentence
[13:35:37] <BillCriswell> I just spent like half an hour on a SO question and I didn't read t right lol.
[13:36:00] <andrew9183> lol what question
[13:36:07] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24943009/how-select-text-on-mouseover-and-then-put-it-into-a-variable-for-further-use-in/24943351#24943351
[13:36:13] <BillCriswell> question was pretty bad from the start.
[13:41:06] <BillCriswell> too lazy to pee.
[13:45:50] <drej> BillCriswell any idea on what i was asking?
[13:47:35] <BillCriswell> drej: Didn't see the question. I'll read now
[13:48:17] <BillCriswell> drej: I have no clue.
[13:48:36] <Skillet> Hey, guys I need to make this possible: http://jsfiddle.net/u2zVF/
[13:48:50] <Skillet> If you click a div then that div is no longer clickable
[13:48:55] <Skillet> is that possible in jquery?
[13:48:57] <juslintek> Guys can anyone tell me why I get Uncaught SyntaxError Unexpected token ) here: http://www.pressline.lt/lt/zvejams-2
[13:49:08] <juslintek> it directs to css not js
[13:49:11] <drej> BillCriswell fair enough, figured id ask :)
[13:49:48] <BillCriswell> Skillet: You can use .one
[13:50:01] <Skillet> BillCriswell: Please specify
[13:50:13] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[13:51:01] <drej> Skillet it lets you bind an event that goes away after its triggered once
[13:51:10] <drej> in this case, a click event, which will then get unbinded as soon as it triggers
[13:52:07] <Skillet> Is this the correct implementation of .one? http://jsfiddle.net/u2zVF/1/
[13:52:33] <BillCriswell> It's working...
[13:53:22] <BillCriswell> Skillet: Might be better off just giving us the big picture here. Are you trying to make only one clickable at a time?
[13:53:23] <Peacegrove> Skillet, do you really need to use jQuery for that?
[13:54:18] <Skillet> yes
[13:54:27] <Skillet> like after you click one of them you cant click that one any more
[13:54:31] <Skillet> but the others are now clickable
[13:55:46] <BillCriswell> So wouldn't they all be clickable or do you need to start from a specific one?
[13:55:47] <djam90> Guys I am using an AngularJS directive that uses jQuery element.is( ":visible" ) but I want to check if something is below the page up to 500px, is this possible? So like bottom of the viewport, and another 500px below (think infinity scroll to pre-load images)
[13:56:29] <Skillet> actually .one isnt what i need i just realized
[13:56:40] <Skillet> sorry this is difficult to explain
[13:56:42] <Peacegrove> Skillet, why do you need jquery for that?
[13:57:25] <Skillet> i need it so that if an element is clicked then that elementcan only run again after another element is clicked
[13:57:35] <Skillet> but you can click the same element twice and have it run twice
[13:57:52] <Skillet> each element can only run once in a row
[13:57:58] <Skillet> if that makes sense
[13:58:13] <Peacegrove> Like radio-buttons?
[13:58:20] <Skillet> yes
[13:58:30] <Skillet> you can think of it like that
[13:58:31] <Peacegrove> Can't you use radio buttons then?
[13:58:35] <Skillet> but it needs to be jquery
[13:58:39] <Skillet> no i cant use radio buttons
[13:58:43] <Nolan2> Hi, I'm trying to use the jquery mobile loader widget, I got it to display properly on page load, however I want to hide it after a specific javascript function is executed. I tried calling the hide function, but I'm not having any luck. The examples on the site only show a working demo of hide when a button is clicked.
[13:59:01] <Nolan2> What would be the best way to implement this?
[13:59:48] <Peacegrove> Skillet, why cant you use radiobuttons?
[14:00:08] <Skillet> because i already have divs doing stuff in javascript after you click on them
[14:00:11] <Peacegrove> Skillet, you can style radio buttons so they don't looks like radio buttons
[14:00:17] <Skillet> but problems occur when the same div is clicked twice
[14:00:43] <Skillet> radio buttons are so far from what i need
[14:01:17] <Peacegrove> Okey.. maybe you can add a class on the element. If a div has that class nothing happens.
[14:01:45] <Skillet> hm
[14:01:46] <BillCriswell> Skillet: http://jsbin.com/figuma/1/edit?html,js,output should help
[14:01:59] <decx> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xf2Gg/show/ i added tilt for mobile, it's pretty good on chrome emu, but a bit choppy on an actual chrome on android
[14:02:20] <BillCriswell> It's freaking out with the mouse haha
[14:02:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Was that device orientation stuff fun or annoying?
[14:03:27] <decx> look at it
[14:03:32] <decx> i copied the first answer from stack
[14:03:42] <decx> hm what's gooing on in chrome with mouse
[14:03:46] <decx> didnt even test
[14:03:48] <decx> ^^
[14:03:53] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[14:04:01] <decx> ff didnt change
[14:04:20] <Skillet> Thanks BillCriswell  that should help me
[14:04:25] <BillCriswell> Damn Chromes
[14:04:33] <Skillet> although my time is up so I'll have to continue fiddling with this tomorrow.
[14:04:34] <Skillet> thanks
[14:04:59] <decx> BillCriswell check out without show, i dont have the weird stuff with chrome there
[14:05:03] <BillCriswell> Skillet: No problem.
[14:05:22] <BillCriswell> Still happens to me there decx.
[14:05:44] <decx> damn chrome ^^
[14:06:27] <BillCriswell> OSX, if that makes a difference.
[14:06:49] <decx> i just had it too
[14:06:51] <decx> but not anymore
[14:06:59] <decx> probably some requestanimationframe nonsense
[14:07:50] <BillCriswell> All that technology mumbojumbo!
[14:07:59] <BillCriswell> It's 5 and I am going home.
[14:08:23] <BillCriswell> g2g
[14:08:24] <decx> cu
[14:08:34] <BillCriswell> kthx
[14:12:36] <Nolan2> Never mind, I think I got it figured out myself.. lol.
[14:14:22] <Jayro> hey, does anyone know how I can have a divs content slide with it when I call slideDown() on the dive?
[14:14:36] <Jayro> like a drawer, instead of just growing the div
[14:15:22] <Nolan2> Do you have an example of what you're trying to do?
[14:17:02] <Jayro> I was just looking for an example, and may have found my answer
[14:17:03] <Jayro> http://jsfiddle.net/yGZHC/
[14:17:52] <Jayro> I guess my question is, is there a way to do with jquery? Instead of just manipulating the top margin?
[14:19:34] <duch_kazatel> jquery will basically wind up doing that.
[14:20:26] <Jayro> duch_kazatel, but it will not slide the divs its containing with it
[14:21:01] <Jayro> it ends up looking like slideDown() is just setting overflow to hidden and animating the height of the div to 0
[14:21:04] <duch_kazatel> sorry, not really paying attention :)
[14:21:52] <Nolan2> Jayro: kind of like this? http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[14:22:19] <Jayro> yeah, exactly how the content slides with the div,
[14:22:34] <Jayro> thats what im looking for, but without an accodion
[14:22:52] <Nolan2> I'm sure you can manipulate the code for that.
[14:28:20] <Nolan2> gotta run. Good luck Jayro.
[14:37:29] <MarkyC> I'm making a simple quiz using form elements. Each fieldset corresponds to one question. I plan to quickly verify the answers client side. What is the best way to determine the `checked` radio button in each fieldset?
[14:37:35] <MarkyC> Should I do it by name?
[14:38:59] <MarkyC> $('[name="question1"]') or $('[name*="question"]') ?
[14:39:30] <duch_kazatel> the former if you can't add an ID to each field.
[14:41:28] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: so that selector would return N radio buttons with the name question1, how do I determine the checked one? Or rather, the index of it?
[14:43:21] <Hrumph> hi are you allowed a click event on a div or does it have to be some kind of button?
[14:44:38] <MarkyC> Hrumph: anything
[14:44:57] <Hrumph> ok will teste that soon in any case...
[14:45:31] <MarkyC> See the docs for an example of click() being used on a <p> element: http://api.jquery.com/click/#example-0
[14:50:29] <duch_kazatel> MarkyC sorry.  was off doin' stuff.  this is why you want to use an ID.  if you're binding using that, $(this) is the checked element within your handler.
[14:52:31] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: I can use an ID if that makes it simple. I'm making a quick and dirty tutorial/quiz where my user watches a youtube vid and answers a few multiple choice questions. I don't care if they cheat, I just want to ensure they answer all questions correctly before marking them off as having completed the tutorial
[14:52:49] <duch_kazatel> or use a class, either way.
[14:52:56] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors feel strange for a reason.
[14:54:32] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: what would you advise regarding structuring the HTML here? Currently it's <form><fieldset><legend>Question1</legend><radio><radio><radio></fieldset> <fieldset><legend>Question2 etc...</legend><radio><radio><radio></fieldset></form>
[14:54:50] <MarkyC> where <radio> is <input type=radio...>
[14:56:37] <decx> wrap your radio inputs in a label
[14:56:55] <MarkyC> decx: That was a quick example, I have labels
[14:57:02] <MarkyC> I was thinking on the JS side having an array of correct indices ( var correctAnswers = [1, 3, 1, 0, 2] ) or having the value of correct answers be "correct". I'm not sure if the array of correct answers will work because I'm not sure the selector will preserve the order
[14:58:26] <dmsuperman> Given a selector $('#node li.active')  how can I find the next li after li.active within #node?
[14:58:28] <MarkyC> decx: I also hate it when lazy devs don't and I have to try so hard to hit the little radio button
[14:58:36] <dmsuperman> It may not come as sequentially the next node since there are multiple lists
[14:58:46] <frank_o> Can anyone tell why jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery/) is hijacking iScroll's (http://iscrolljs.com/) taps when emulating a mobile device in Chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/w3pvW/
[14:58:50] <frank_o> Works fine, however, if I disable the touch gestures part of Chrome's mobile emulation (or disable emulation altogether).
[15:00:28] <duch_kazatel> frank_o lol we're not going to be able to help you on that one.
[15:00:52] <dmsuperman> I guess I could do $('#node li').each(function(el, i) { if ($(this).hasClass('active') { if ($('#node li')[i + 1].length > 0) { var found = $('#node li')[i + 1]; } } });  but that's rather messy
[15:01:22] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman mind clarying why you're trying to do that?
[15:01:33] <dmsuperman> I want to find the next li after the currently active li
[15:01:38] <dmsuperman> even if it's in another ul
[15:01:42] <dmsuperman> they're all contained in #node
[15:05:17] <dmsuperman> duch_kazatel: http://i.imgur.com/u0DNYXb.png  so in this case I would want Contact Us, but once Contact Us is higlighted I would want Online Hearing Aid Seminar
[15:05:41] <dmsuperman> er I guess LACE would be the next one but either way
[15:07:54] <decx> put all the lis in a collection
[15:07:57] <decx> and use eq
[15:08:29] <dmsuperman> $('#node li').eq('li.active').next() ?
[15:08:44] <decx> probably not
[15:08:45] <dmsuperman> or is that not what next would do
[15:09:15] <decx> for what do you need it?
[15:09:32] <MediaMis_> How can I print a false boolean value?
[15:09:33] <dmsuperman> I just explained above
[15:09:51] <dmsuperman> oh I see .eq is a specified index
[15:09:57] <decx> that didnt explain it
[15:10:05] <decx> for what do you need the next one
[15:10:09] <decx> keyboard controls?
[15:10:22] <dmsuperman> I have a delete button: http://i.imgur.com/cbyTZeL.png
[15:10:29] <dmsuperman> it calls an AJAX request to delete the page and it responds OK
[15:10:46] <dmsuperman> so I want to move the user onto the next page in that case and remove the matching node
[15:10:52] <dmsuperman> matching link/li*
[15:11:02] <decx> ah
[15:11:09] <decx> now it makes sense ^^
[15:11:50] <MediaMis_> nm. used. JSON.stringify
[15:11:59] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: i passed e to the function , i gave you the another  link which i dint edit :)
[15:13:02] <Axel_> I'm trying to execute a function when an image on facebook is loaded. I am using delegate, so when more content is loaded, those images will be bound to my function as well. I can't get it to work though. My code: $("#stream_pagelet").delegate("img","mouseover",function(){console.log("mouseover");});
[15:13:42] <Axel_> I don't mean loaded, I mean when it's hovered.
[15:14:26] <dmsuperman> Axel_: use .on
[15:14:48] <Axel_> .on won't bind future elements, will it ?
[15:15:10] <dmsuperman> that's exactly what it will do... you can even bind it to the document with a selector for performance benefits
[15:15:54] <dmsuperman> $('#stream_pagelet img').on('mouseover'...   or better yet  $(document).on('mouseover', '#stream_pagelet img', function...
[15:15:59] <dmsuperman> depending on how many imgs you have
[15:16:46] <Axel_> won't that affect performance badly ?
[15:16:56] <dmsuperman> that's what the latter syntax is for
[15:17:01] <dmsuperman> it only binds 1 event listener to the document
[15:17:56] <Axel_> Err, I have tried that, but it won't work.
[15:18:02] <Axel_> Still doesn't log anything
[15:18:02] <dmsuperman> What won't work?
[15:18:11] <Axel_> the .on way on the document
[15:18:38] <Axel_> Wait, I have switched 2 arguments
[15:21:27] <Axel_> No, it refuses to do anything. My code now: $(document).on("mouseover","#stream_pagelet img",function(){console.log("mouseover");});
[15:22:05] <dmsuperman> http://jsbin.com/kimawufa/1/edit
[15:22:47] <decx> dmsuperman did you solve your index problem?
[15:22:53] <dmsuperman> I suspect you have another issue going on Axel_, any JS errors? are you sure that snippet is being executed?
[15:23:04] <dmsuperman> decx: I might just create something like .filter() that returns the index of the filtered element
[15:23:08] <dmsuperman> and use that for .eq
[15:23:16] <dmsuperman> ...or I might just be lazy and use that initial messy suggestion
[15:23:19] <decx> dmsuperman yes http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3LMud/
[15:23:22] <Axel_> the firefox console doesn't return any errors
[15:23:37] <dmsuperman> add an alert to the snippet Axel_ on the line above
[15:23:48] <dmsuperman> make sure it's running... make sure your selector matches, etc
[15:23:58] <dmsuperman> my jsbin shows that that syntax does work even for dynamically added imgs
[15:24:15] <Axel_> Your code works yes, but mine doesn't
[15:24:36] <dmsuperman> which indicates that it's not the .on method or the mouseover, and there's another problem
[15:24:43] <dmsuperman> hence my suggestion to investigate further and see what all is going on
[15:25:06] <dmsuperman> interesting decx I didn't know about the .index method
[15:25:08] <dmsuperman> thanks much!
[15:25:20] <decx> without an argument you get the index relative to the parent
[15:25:41] <decx> so it would be 1 and not 3 like in that example
[15:25:50] <Axel_> On facebook, it works for the ads, but not for the stream. Facebook is a pain in the ass for userscripts anyway
[15:26:11] <dmsuperman> they could be preventing bubbling
[15:26:16] <dmsuperman> that's a totally different beast
[15:26:54] <dmsuperman> er propagation not bubbling
[15:27:16] <Axel_> the jquery documentation mentions both
[15:27:39] <Axel_> bubbling and propagation
[15:28:21] <dmsuperman> well bubbling means traversing up the DOM and propagation means allowing other event handlers to chime in
[15:28:40] <dmsuperman> decx: thanks much :)
[15:29:28] <Axel_> Any way to easily bypass that ? I didn't intend to put much time in this project :P
[15:29:48] <dmsuperman> to bypass facebook's event handlers? not without knowing more about them I imagine
[15:30:14] <Axel_> facebook is very good at obfuscating, sadly
[15:30:18] <dmsuperman> are you sure the selector still matches even on the stream elements?
[15:30:46] <dmsuperman> meaning if you run $('#stream_pagelet img') and dynamically load some images to the page they are 100% apart of that collection?
[15:31:08] <Axel_> Yes, I have tried with only img and the ads would execute my function
[15:32:27] <dmsuperman> are you sure the stream loaded images are actually img?
[15:32:42] <Axel_> Yes, I have tried it with other elements such as divs as well
[15:34:12] <Axel_> if I could find out what function loads new elements I could take that over and do what I wish to do as well
[15:34:16] <vilgefortz> hello
[15:34:27] <vilgefortz> http://pastebin.com/5iUK01C2 got problem with that chunk of code
[15:34:52] <vilgefortz> it throws me into error callback
[15:35:11] <dmsuperman> I imagine you'd be violating facebook ToS to override their code
[15:35:18] <dmsuperman> you're better off finding a workaround
[15:35:32] <vilgefortz> jsonArray looks like this [{"id":"1"},{"id":"2"}]
[15:36:01] <dmsuperman> vilgefortz: screenshot of the network response in your console?
[15:36:08] <Axel_> I'm not going to publish it anyway, it's for my own ease
[15:36:29] <dmsuperman> if it's not sending the right HTTP status then $.ajax will send you to error handler
[15:38:55] <Axel_> How is bubbling prevented anyway ? I can't think of any way
[15:40:14] <dmsuperman> I guess I misused the terms... event.stopPropagation() will stop it bubbling up
[15:40:24] <dmsuperman> stopImmediatePropagation() will prevent other handlers from being called
[15:40:54] <vilgefortz> wow it redirected me finally
[15:42:09] <Axel_> Yes I know jQuery has stopPropagation, but how does it work ?
[15:42:52] <dmsuperman> I think it's actually just a javascript function that jquery wraps
[15:42:56] <dmsuperman> built into JS
[15:43:02] <dmsuperman> there's also preventDefault
[15:43:07] <dmsuperman> which stops the browser's default action from running
[15:43:20] <vilgefortz> now another question
[15:43:33] <vilgefortz> im going to recieve this JSON in php
[15:43:45] <vilgefortz> this code is not working
[15:43:47] <vilgefortz> http://pastebin.com/NksGRr1A
[15:44:57] <dmsuperman> 1: This is #jquery, 2: "is not working" is a meaningless statement, 3: the code looks fine to me, I suspect you're not sending good JSON
[15:44:58] <Axel_> Weird, I bound a function to the documents mousemove, and when I move my mouse over an image, it logs as well, that must mean it's still bubbling, right ?
[15:45:29] <dmsuperman> well your mouse is moving over the document even if it's moving over an img, no?
[15:45:54] <Axel_> Yes but if they would have used stopPropagation, it shouldn't log, right ?
[15:45:58] <dmsuperman> also mousemove and mouseover are different events and as such have different event handlers, one may be stopped and the other may not
[15:46:08] <vilgefortz> Json looks like i said befor
[15:46:15] <Axel_> Right, maybe I should try mousemove
[15:46:16] <vilgefortz> [{"id":"1"},{"id":"2"}]
[15:46:24] <dmsuperman> vilgefortz: see #1 and #2
[15:47:11] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I assign a value to a data attribute. I tried $(element).data('id') = "something"; but it's not giving it the value
[15:47:15] <bl4ckdu5t> ?
[15:47:31] <Axel_> You're right, mousemove still fires. I guess I should work around that then. Thanks !
[15:47:49] <dmsuperman> bl4ckdu5t: in javascript the left side of the = operator needs to reference a variable... you're referencing a value
[15:48:07] <dmsuperman> bl4ckdu5t: here is the documentation for the .data method: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[15:55:10] <bl4ckdu5t> dmsuperman: the docs didn't hit it for me
[15:55:23] <bl4ckdu5t> Trying to assign a value to a data attribute
[15:55:46] <bl4ckdu5t> data-id
[15:56:13] <bl4ckdu5t> $(element).data('id','myValue')  -> didn't work
[15:56:34] <bl4ckdu5t> $(element).data('id) = 'myValue'   -> didn't work
[15:57:10] <systemfault> Of courseâ€¦
[15:57:26] <bl4ckdu5t> systemfault: how should it be?
[15:57:36] <systemfault> $(element).data('id', 'myValue')
[15:58:05] <bl4ckdu5t> That didn't work
[15:58:06] <systemfault> bl4ckdu5t: How do you know it didn't work?
[15:58:38] <systemfault> BTW, .data doesn't modify attributes...
[15:58:42] <bl4ckdu5t> I inspected the element in the DOM and couldn't find its value
[15:58:46] <systemfault> So you won't see it changed in your inspector
[15:59:06] <systemfault> bl4ckdu5t: If you want to change the actual attribute, you need .attr('id', 'myValue')
[15:59:08] <systemfault> Err
[15:59:09] <systemfault> Sorry
[15:59:16] <systemfault> .attr('data-id', 'myValue')
[15:59:24] <bl4ckdu5t> oh! ok thanks
[15:59:36] <systemfault> It's usually not what you want to do thoughâ€¦
[15:59:42] <bl4ckdu5t> will .prop work the same way?
[15:59:49] <systemfault> That's why .data exists
[15:59:56] <duch_kazatel> .prop() instead of .attr()
[15:59:56] <systemfault> bl4ckdu5t: In this specific case, yes
[16:00:06] <duch_kazatel> but instead you want .data() for data attributes.
[16:00:08] <duch_kazatel> always always always
[16:00:14] <bl4ckdu5t> I always prefer .prop
[16:00:20] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: He has a custom attribute.
[16:00:21] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[16:00:28] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: That changes the rule a bit.
[16:00:32] <duch_kazatel> those are not valid.
[16:01:08] <systemfault> $(element).prop('data-id', 'myValue') won't work
[16:01:21] <systemfault> Not supposed to at least.
[16:01:23] <duch_kazatel> you can't just create attributes on the fly.  you can use data() for data attributes/data attached to nodes.
[16:02:37] <bl4ckdu5t> I've always used .data() only to retrieve. Never to add
[16:02:50] <duch_kazatel> .data('name', 'value');
[16:03:01] <bl4ckdu5t> duch_kazatel: that didn't work
[16:03:11] <duch_kazatel> then you have something going on.
[16:03:25] <dmsuperman> no, it works, he just expects it to show up in his inspector
[16:03:32] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[16:03:38] <duch_kazatel> that'll never show in the inspector.
[16:03:42] <duch_kazatel> it's not supposed to.
[16:03:45] <dmsuperman> if you want that then you have to do two calls bl4ckdu5t  .data('name', 'value').attr('data-name', 'value')
[16:03:48] <dmsuperman> but that's silly
[16:03:48] <bl4ckdu5t> why wouldn't it?
[16:03:56] <dmsuperman> because .data isn't attributes
[16:03:59] <duch_kazatel> because you're not editing the markup.
[16:04:02] <dmsuperman> it just happens to be pre-populated with attributes
[16:04:11] <duch_kazatel> you're editing a cached version of that element's data.
[16:04:24] <duch_kazatel> it's much faster than looking at the element's attributes for that data.
[16:04:25] <systemfault> dmsuperman: Yeahâ€¦ we need to thank jQuery for making that part confusing.
[16:04:44] <bl4ckdu5t> If I check for .data('name') letter with the script, will I get the value even as it doesn't show up in inspector?
[16:04:49] <dmsuperman> Is it jQuery's fault? I never really expected every meta data on the DOM to reflect in the inspector
[16:04:49] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:04:58] <duch_kazatel> bl4ckdu5t try it.
[16:05:36] <dmsuperman> seems like a general DOM issue/confusion
[16:05:42] <systemfault> dmsuperman: I meant, the confusing part is that jQuery populates .data() with data attributes
[16:05:48] <dmsuperman> ohh yes
[16:05:54] <systemfault> dmsuperman: Which it voodoo magic
[16:06:05] <dmsuperman> I agree with that. it's convenient yes but makes for much confusion
[16:06:19] <duch_kazatel> the docs explain it all pretty well.
[16:06:47] <dmsuperman> is a:enabled  not meant to work?
[16:06:52] <dmsuperman> doesn't seem to work for me
[16:07:02] <dmsuperman> do I have to do a:not(:disabled) ?
[16:07:15] <duch_kazatel> enabled is for forms.
[16:07:19] <duch_kazatel> *inputs, rather.
[16:07:39] <dmsuperman> but <a disabled="true"> works doesn't it? maybe I'm high
[16:07:59] <dmsuperman> no nevermind I'm just being silly
[16:08:17] <systemfault> dmsuperman: Also, the value of the disabled attribute is meaningless, it's a dummy
[16:08:24] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:08:33] <duch_kazatel> the existence of the word is enough.
[16:08:34] <systemfault> dmsuperman: <a disabled="false"> is still disabled.
[16:08:58] <systemfault> Butâ€¦ I thought that disabled only worked for form elements
[16:09:05] <duch_kazatel> it does.
[16:09:06] <dmsuperman> yeah that's the part I'm confused about
[16:09:07] <duch_kazatel> they were mistaked :)
[16:09:09] <duch_kazatel> *mistaken
[16:09:12] <systemfault> Ahâ€¦ ok!
[16:26:41] <bl4ckdu5t> you were right guys. I'm using data('name','value')
[16:26:50] <bl4ckdu5t> thanks
[16:27:57] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:51:45] <PantsOfChoco> jquery peeps
[16:51:53] <PantsOfChoco> anyone here that can help me
[16:52:38] <PantsOfChoco> has anyone had a problem with document on click clicking wayyyy more times than me doing a single click?
[17:09:03] <Keavon> How do I call a function with an argument and inside that function it makes an ajax call and returns the result when it fetches the result?
[17:10:58] <Keavon> I found how to do it one way but you can't pass an argument
[17:11:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:12:03] <duch_kazatel> you can totally do that.  mind sharing your code?
[17:18:33] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: Were you talking to me?
[17:23:53] <duch_kazatel> yep
[17:24:52] <Keavon> Sorry for the late response (again), please just mention my name in the future so I notice
[17:25:00] <Keavon> I'll get the code for you
[17:25:15] <duch_kazatel> Keavon sure.  there was nobody else here so i didn't think it mattered.
[17:25:48] <duch_kazatel> autonotifications notwithstandin
[17:25:50] <duch_kazatel> *g
[17:28:08] <Keavon> http://pastebin.com/61QzMTV4
[17:28:42] <duch_kazatel> that should work just fine.
[17:28:56] <duch_kazatel> though the page will be wrong.
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> wait nvm.
[17:29:10] <Keavon> It returns undefined because it doesn't have tie to actually retrieve the file
[17:29:21] <Keavon> The call is async but it's adding it to the variable instantly
[17:29:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you need to do your console log in the success callback.
[17:30:05] <duch_kazatel> also: you should use .done()/.fal() instead.
[17:30:29] <Keavon> What do you mean by that last part?
[17:30:39] <duch_kazatel> err, .fail()
[17:30:45] <duch_kazatel> so it'd be $.ajax().done().fail()
[17:30:50] <duch_kazatel> instead of using success and error
[17:32:24] <Keavon> What's the reason to do that?
[17:32:48] <duch_kazatel> success and error are deprecated because of the move to promises/deferred objects.
[17:34:05] <Keavon> Would you mind modifying my code to include that? I'm still confused about your syntax.
[17:35:51] <mdev> I think jquery support should be built into the browser
[17:35:57] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[17:36:04] <duch_kazatel> Keavon http://fixee.org/paste/ymzsh2u/
[17:36:40] <Keavon> Thank you
[17:36:52] <mdev> duch I don't because the only disadvantage would be they wouldn't have latest jquery version, however browsers update quite a bit so they could have the current supported version built in
[17:37:00] <mdev> and you can use bleeding edge if you want with external now
[17:37:12] <mdev> but it'd be lot nicer than having to push that file everywhere
[17:37:23] <Keavon> I'm using the latest version of jQuery 2
[17:37:25] <Keavon> (2.1.1?)
[17:37:38] <Keavon> Older browser support isn't important to be
[17:37:39] <Keavon> me*
[17:37:40] <duch_kazatel> 1. the entire reason we use jquery is because browser vendors have a hard time getting the DOM apis correct.  adding in another layer to that equation would be a nightmare.
[17:38:06] <duch_kazatel> 2. if you use google's CDN, or another common one, the user will have a copy cached already.
[17:38:40] <mdev> duch not necessarily, depends on how they did it, if chrome, firefox, opera, safari all agreed on a simple plugin/addon feature where you could import javascript code and have that functionality available on all pages
[17:38:53] <mdev> it could come with latest jquery and you could just update yourself if you want
[17:38:58] <duch_kazatel> they can't agree on a lot of things.
[17:39:03] <mdev> that's true
[17:39:04] <duch_kazatel> see point #1
[17:39:15] <duch_kazatel> which is why we have jquery in the first place ;)
[17:39:29] <mdev> well jquery is beyond dom api's
[17:39:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:39:45] <duch_kazatel> jquery is all about DOM apis
[17:39:50] <mdev> it's amazing library, it almost makes javascript into a new language
[17:39:55] <mdev> a simpler, powerful, awesome language
[17:40:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:40:08] <mdev> WAT MAT?
[17:40:11] <mdev> MATE
[17:40:16] <duch_kazatel> not at all.  you're still writing the exact same language.
[17:40:16] <mdev> lol at huh
[17:40:23] <duch_kazatel> the language is the same.
[17:40:29] <mdev> technically but not in actuality
[17:40:33] <duch_kazatel> yes in actuality.
[17:40:39] <duch_kazatel> show me one case where it's not.
[17:40:40] <Keavon> So I tried setting async to false but it's still not returning anything
[17:41:00] <mdev> you can write cross browser javascript code that itneracts with DOM but it could be VERY LONG and ugly and annoying, jquery makes it much smaller, easier to read
[17:41:22] <duch_kazatel> that's the DOM api again.
[17:41:24] <duch_kazatel> not the language.
[17:41:24] <mdev> tons of jquery plugins too
[17:41:32] <duch_kazatel> Keavon because you want this: http://fixee.org/paste/ymzsh2u/#url=w2fxvc6
[17:41:43] <mdev> duch kazatel it's almost a new language
[17:41:50] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[17:42:01] <duch_kazatel> it's a single constructor function that creates a pretty magical object.
[17:42:10] <tw2113> jQuery = a bunch of js functions/methods
[17:42:16] <duch_kazatel> that's all it is.
[17:42:34] <duch_kazatel> mdev your problem is with the DOM, not javascript.
[17:42:45] <mdev> javascript in itself is pretty ugly
[17:42:54] <mdev> jquery makes it beautiful, but define it as you will
[17:43:02] <duch_kazatel> not at all.  it's a much better language than you think.
[17:43:04] <Keavon> That console.log's it but it doesn't return a variable. I need some way of getting a variable out of calling a function
[17:43:27] <duch_kazatel> Keavon if you're doing async programming you need to put all that logic in the .done() callback.
[17:43:46] <Keavon> How about setting async to false?
[17:43:53] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea.
[17:44:13] <duch_kazatel> mdev you should check out JavaScript: The Good Parts.
[17:44:41] <duch_kazatel> you'd learn a lot.  javascript is a neat little language that gets a bad rap because of a shitty, inconsistent API.
[17:44:45] <duch_kazatel> *from browsers.
[17:44:48] <mdev> maybe but honestly I don't really like it all, i'm using a lot of it these days for front end and backend with node.js
[17:44:54] <mdev> but i'm not a fan of the callback for everything
[17:44:57] <mdev> super annoying
[17:45:03] <duch_kazatel> you're still doing that with jquery.
[17:45:12] <Keavon> Maybe I should back up and state my intentions. I want to create a simple function that wraps a jQ ajax call. Argument: file path, Returns: file contents
[17:45:23] <mdev> sure, but at least I can write less code, have better cross browser supper, access to lot of plugins
[17:45:28] <mdev> and it looks cleaner
[17:46:10] <Keavon> How would I go about doing that?
[17:46:18] <duch_kazatel> plugins are meh.  dependent.  and a lot of things that we used to use jquery for don't need jquery any more.
[17:46:20] <tw2113> why does this sound like a circular debate?
[17:46:40] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 because it's based on the assumption that jquery somehow modifies the language
[17:46:47] <duch_kazatel> Keavon i can show you.
[17:46:50] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[17:46:52] <mdev> tw2113 because some people can't appreciate jquery for what it is apparently
[17:46:53] <Keavon> Thanks
[17:47:03] <mdev> go write in raw JS for everything then come back and tell me what jquery isn't
[17:47:05] <tw2113> duch_kazatel appreciates it well enough from everything i've seen
[17:47:09] <duch_kazatel> mdev i don't disagree that jquery is very useful in some cases, but it doesn't change the language to me.
[17:47:20] <duch_kazatel> in fact, i love it, but it doesn't modify the language one bit.
[17:47:26] <mdev> I said *almost anyway, I know it's still javascript regardless, just amazed at how much nicer jquery makes things
[17:47:27] <tw2113> he's just able to differentiate between a library and a language
[17:47:38] <mdev> never really seen that in any other language before
[17:48:33] <duch_kazatel> mdev because most other languages don't have to deal with the sorts of inconsistencies and environments javascript does.
[17:48:36] <PantsOfChoco> i hate jquery and javascript HOW CAN YALL ENJOY THIS
[17:48:45] <tw2113> jQuery utilizes the language, doesn't modify it
[17:48:47] <duch_kazatel> Keavon so you're basically convoluting things.
[17:49:24] <duch_kazatel> could you expand on what you're trying to do?
[17:49:34] <mdev> choco lol
[17:49:59] <Keavon> I'm creating a web app that has lots of AJAX calls to lots of resources
[17:50:09] <Keavon> I wanted to wrap that in a function to shorten the syntax
[17:50:13] <tw2113> inside one "pretty" jQuery method is likely as many conditions and cases to handle as many browser differences as needed
[17:50:46] <duch_kazatel> Keavon that's not going to work the way you want it to.
[17:50:48] <tw2113> if the browser can use querySelectAll(), it does, otherwise it'll continue on to something else it can
[17:51:10] <mdev> tw2113 yeah jquery is javascript done right
[17:51:31] <tw2113> jquery is javascript done as wide of consistent support it can manage
[17:51:34] <mdev> it's not enough to be a simple language that browesrs "support", and leaving it to the developers to cater to all the difference
[17:51:46] <duch_kazatel> mdev again, it's not the language it changes, it's the DOM api.
[17:51:51] <mdev> real world languages need to solve real world problems efficiently and that's what jquery does
[17:51:59] <duch_kazatel> javascript does that just fine.
[17:52:05] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating a library with a language.
[17:52:26] <Keavon> duch_kazatel Can you explain what you mean by it not going to work out the way I want it to? I can see the current problems, and how you can't return a variable from an asyc call
[17:52:37] <mdev> i'm not conflating anything, I understand javascript is under the hood, but it's inadequate in itself
[17:52:38] <Keavon> Is there any other way to wrap it to shorten the syntax?
[17:52:43] <mdev> for real usage
[17:52:52] <duch_kazatel> mdev your problem is not javascript, it's the DOM api.
[17:53:00] <mdev> unless again you want to try and reinvent the wheel for every little thing
[17:53:13] <duch_kazatel> mdev give an example of what you're talking about.
[17:53:23] <mdev> I use jquery in node.js just fine
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> Keavon can you show more of your code?
[17:53:26] <mdev> no DOM api there buddy
[17:53:37] <duch_kazatel> mdev which methods are you using then, "buddy"?
[17:53:55] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: What part? All I'm looking to do is store the contents of a given file in a variable.
[17:53:55] <mdev> stringify, parse, lots
[17:54:02] <duch_kazatel> the utility functions.
[17:54:29] <duch_kazatel> that have arguably no business being in the language proper because the spec is pretty clear about input/output ;)
[17:54:44] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: This is currently the only utility function I have.
[17:55:00] <duch_kazatel> Keavon how will the ajax calls differ?
[17:55:04] <mdev> the language should work for the dev not the dev for the language, if at any time the language makes things harder for the dev it's not doing its job
[17:55:10] <mdev> time is precious
[17:55:13] <dmsuperman> javascript is a very powerful development language
[17:55:20] <dmsuperman> I use it for web services all the time
[17:55:20] <duch_kazatel> i still don't see how javascript makes anything harder.
[17:55:28] <duch_kazatel> APIs are the problem.
[17:55:29] <dmsuperman> the trouble is when you want to use the DOM
[17:55:31] <dmsuperman> yep
[17:55:44] <mdev> well you're talking about removing incredibly useful and heavily used functionality from jquery
[17:55:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:55:53] <mdev> because it doesn't follow some standards
[17:55:59] <duch_kazatel> i never said to remove anything from jquery.
[17:56:08] <mdev> duch_kazatel> that have arguably no business being in the language proper because the spec is pretty clear about input/output ;)
[17:56:13] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:56:17] <duch_kazatel> in javascript, not jquery.
[17:56:20] <duch_kazatel> as in, the standard library.
[17:56:28] <duch_kazatel> well, "standard library"
[17:56:31] <mdev> why would you remove functionality?
[17:56:34] <duch_kazatel> i'm not.
[17:56:55] <duch_kazatel> you're contending that those "useful features" should be made apart of the language.  I'm saying they shouldn't.
[17:57:22] <duch_kazatel> you want a library that handles that?  fantastic!  i use jquery everywhere and really like it.
[17:57:53] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: Here's my code app thus far https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39034206/Trackbox/index.html
[17:57:55] <mdev> it's sad when you can't truely utilize features with confidence using the language itself and have to turn to a third party library
[17:58:01] <Keavon> I want to replace the play button with a pause button
[17:58:02] <dmsuperman> the things jquery handles make no sense in a non-DOM environment. so it makes no sense whatsoever to include those features into the language
[17:58:09] <Keavon> when I pause the song
[17:58:10] <dmsuperman> Why would you include all that DOM code in a node.js app?
[17:58:10] <duch_kazatel> mdev huh?
[17:58:15] <tw2113> i can think of worse sad things
[17:58:18] <duch_kazatel> mdev what in the hell are you talking about?>
[17:58:41] <Keavon> duch_kazatel So I want to retrieve the pause button SVG text from a single file
[17:58:50] <Keavon> Here's the source on github https://github.com/Trackbox/Trackbox/blob/master/packages/trackbox/trackbox.html
[17:59:11] <duch_kazatel> mdev the problems that you're seeing with the language are not faults of the language.
[17:59:25] <duch_kazatel> you still haven't given an actual example that demonstrates what you're talking about.
[17:59:37] <mdev> i'm saying without jquery you'd be spending a lot of time writing different versions of the same code, long, ugly, and complicated to cater to all the different browsers
[17:59:52] <duch_kazatel> give an example of when you'd do that.
[17:59:56] <dmsuperman> which is why we have jquery, and I'm glad we do
[17:59:58] <mdev> sure 1 second
[18:00:02] <dmsuperman> but you're saying jquery should be a part of the core language
[18:00:06] <dmsuperman> and that's just nonsense
[18:00:25] <dmsuperman> jquery is exactly where it should be, in a library
[18:00:44] <duch_kazatel> the problems he's talking about are not problems with the language; they're problems with the DOM api.
[18:00:54] <dmsuperman> Now could javascript borrow some concepts from jquery? sure. and it does, with each iteration of ECMAScript I see more and more features
[18:01:33] <duch_kazatel> Keavon ah, okay, so the way you'd do that is create a global var that has nothing.  var pauseButtonSVG;
[18:02:04] <duch_kazatel> then you'd bind a handler that checks that var and, if it's undefined, run your ajax to fetch the svg and sets that var in the done() callback.
[18:02:11] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: That's my plan. I could set that variable with the AJAX function, but I was hoping to be able to wrap that in shorter syntax
[18:02:12] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8567114/how-to-make-an-ajax-call-without-jquery
[18:02:27] <duch_kazatel> mdev yep.  that's the DOM api in action.
[18:02:29] <Keavon> Since I'm going to be doing that a lot, all over the application, for tons of things (not just SVGs)
[18:02:57] <duch_kazatel> let me show yout the idea, Keavon
[18:03:43] <martixy> So... A small problem: https://openuserjs.org/scripts/martixy/Reddit_Comment_Navigator Line 123 does not work in some cases where the comment is pre-collapsed.
[18:04:01] <tw2113> that ajax example could be a heck of a lot worse
[18:04:14] <tw2113> and it's put into its own function for repeatable use
[18:04:33] <duch_kazatel> that ajax example isn't a javascript problem still.  it's a DOM API problem.
[18:04:35] <martixy> And I have no idea why.
[18:04:44] <tw2113> create a parameter and you have yourself very re-usable
[18:04:55] <tw2113> pass in a url for it
[18:05:15] <Keavon> tw2113: Are you talking to me?
[18:05:29] <tw2113> no
[18:05:32] <Keavon> k
[18:05:40] <tw2113> i'm participating in this js vs jquery debate
[18:06:27] <dmsuperman> I think mdev just wants to stir up trouble :P
[18:06:50] <duch_kazatel> i remember thinking exactly what he thinks.  just takes time.
[18:06:53] <duch_kazatel> Keavon http://fixee.org/paste/xt004ri/
[18:06:55] <duch_kazatel> something like this.
[18:07:20] <dmsuperman> yeah it took a while to figure out that javascript was jsut the language, not the set of APIs that get bundled with it in browsers. node.js realllly helped me understand
[18:07:22] <duch_kazatel> Keavon you can also dynamically supply a callback to that .done() instaed if you want.
[18:07:34] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman right!  and the language is surprisingly neat!
[18:07:45] <dmsuperman> yeah it's actually my favorite language
[18:07:50] <dmsuperman> after using perl php and python professional for years
[18:08:09] <duch_kazatel> i've done python, ASP, C#, a little Ruby, and a few others.
[18:08:22] <duch_kazatel> javascript always winds up being the easiest for me.
[18:08:24] <Keavon> I'm thinking it will just be shorter to use the full AJAX call each time
[18:08:29] <tw2113> i'm odd considering i enjoy php overall
[18:08:32] <dmsuperman> eugh ASP... I did that for a project once. never again
[18:08:42] <duch_kazatel> Keavon erm, not at all.
[18:08:45] <dmsuperman> I like PHP as long as you use a library or wrapper to hide all the nasty bits
[18:08:46] <duch_kazatel> and that has a lot of overhead.
[18:09:01] <dmsuperman> We use CakePHP at my current job and it's surprisingly nice
[18:09:18] <systemfault> o_O
[18:09:19] <duch_kazatel> asp is okay-ish as long as you use it for templating only.  if you use the whole .NET stack you'll have a surprisingly easy time doing anything.
[18:09:25] <duch_kazatel> otherwise... eh.
[18:09:36] <duch_kazatel> also: i have you all beat on nightmare languages.  we use coldfusion at my current place.
[18:09:42] <systemfault> dmsuperman: What you just said is going to stay in my memoryâ€¦ forever.
[18:09:54] <dmsuperman> about php or cakephp systemfault?
[18:09:58] <systemfault> cakephp
[18:09:59] <dmsuperman> I bow to you duch_kazatel
[18:09:59] <AcidRain> vb6
[18:10:03] <dmsuperman> systemfault: what do you prefer?
[18:10:11] <duch_kazatel> last place has some VB6 still kicking around.
[18:10:11] <dmsuperman> and have you actually used it since v2?
[18:10:14] <systemfault> dmsuperman: Anything :/
[18:10:27] <dmsuperman> because if you haven't that's like using php4 and saying php sucks
[18:10:41] <AcidRain> lol. i actually rly like vb6
[18:10:45] <duch_kazatel> ew
[18:10:51] <duch_kazatel> php and vb
[18:10:52] <systemfault> dmsuperman: I've used it enough to know it's badâ€¦ When things like Symfony 2 and Laravel exist.
[18:11:07] <AcidRain> i like php more
[18:11:08] <dmsuperman> that sounds like a rather uninformed decision :P
[18:11:23] <dmsuperman> symfony isn't bad either
[18:11:24] <tw2113> yay php frameworks
[18:11:26] <AcidRain> like perl the best
[18:11:34] <dmsuperman> ah so you're a masochist AcidRain
[18:11:46] <duch_kazatel> could always be LISP.
[18:12:09] <tw2113> say anything if you like COBOL
[18:12:18] <duch_kazatel> what about FORTRAN?
[18:12:28] <tw2113> ewww duch_kazatel you like COBOL?
[18:12:32] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[18:12:40] <duch_kazatel> if you want money fast, you want COBOL
[18:12:57] <AcidRain> dmsuperman: not to sure on the context. but i llike bash to. just hate dealing with awk and grep
[18:13:11] <AcidRain> alot of grep functions are cool
[18:13:18] <tw2113> ack > grep
[18:13:36] <dmsuperman> I love shell scripting
[18:13:47] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: Can I do something like this? http://fixee.org/paste/a6x5qtk/
[18:13:57] <Keavon> I pass it the file path and the variable I want it to set
[18:14:09] <AcidRain> dmsuperman: ye. i loaded up a recent widows machine (first time i had seen a windows machine in 7 or so yrs), and the cmd line was pretty brutal. lol
[18:14:17] <AcidRain> i was like: man i just need my terminal
[18:14:18] <duch_kazatel> Keavon nope.  nor should you.
[18:14:37] <duch_kazatel> Keavon you're abstracting things the wrong way.

[18:14:55] <duch_kazatel> I'm a heavy windows user.  i cry every time i use linux.
[18:15:07] <tw2113> i just cry
[18:15:09] <PantsOfChoco> psh linux, i mean i guess if you like communism
[18:15:12] <duch_kazatel> faddah that's... old news
[18:15:14] <AcidRain> tw2113: LMAO
[18:15:38] <faddah> duch_kazatel - just saw 30 sec. ago float by on my tweet stream.
[18:15:39] <AcidRain> linux is leet. in windows, yes i cry when i see a windows logo
[18:15:49] <duch_kazatel> faddah the blog post is from april.
[18:15:52] <Keavon> lol you guys
[18:16:06] <PantsOfChoco> jquery just work for me ya jerk
[18:16:07] <AcidRain> but i can go on all day why i dislike windows. each time i see the logo i have nightmare flashbacks
[18:16:12] <tw2113> *wipes eyes*
[18:16:14] <Keavon> ChromeOS FTW jk
[18:16:17] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[18:16:23] <faddah> ?? wow. sorry. i have no idea why it re-generated a tweet.
[18:16:33] <duch_kazatel> faddah are you in control of that bot?
[18:16:38] <AcidRain> android
[18:16:41] <duch_kazatel> or whatever is generating that tweet stream?
[18:17:00] <faddah> duch_kazatel - no, i just subscribe to @AjaxTips on twitter.
[18:17:14] <duch_kazatel> faddah you should subscribe to the jquery one account, too.
[18:17:30] <tw2113> hardcore users tweet from the command line
[18:17:32] <faddah> duch_kazatel - i do.
[18:17:43] <PantsOfChoco> if im reloading part of a page with json, is it smarter to use document on click rather than the element on click?
[18:17:50] <AcidRain> tw2113: LOLLLL!!!11111
[18:17:55] <duch_kazatel> PantsOfChoco depends on what you're doing.
[18:18:18] <PantsOfChoco> i basically am kinda doing like a show next 500 results
[18:18:19] <luvmyh0nda> back: [reason: Idle after 10h]±[gone: 13h52m38s]±[ç§]
[18:18:19] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, I have a page with buttons (shopping cart add/remove items). If a user clicks a second button prior to the previous ajax call completing, it aborts the previous call. How do I circumvent this? This was answered by Jattenalle last night, by wrapping them in a function(){}, but I'm wondering if someone could expand upon this...
[18:18:33] <tw2113> AcidRain, http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/
[18:19:10] <dmsuperman> PantsOfChoco: arbitrary, moving the event handler to the document is useful if you have like hundreds of elements you're trying to bind the event to
[18:19:20] <dmsuperman> if you only have one "next page" button it won't really matter I don't think
[18:19:24] <faddah> just tweeted whoever runs @AjaxTips about that, again, sorry.
[18:19:32] <duch_kazatel> faddah no big deal :)
[18:19:34] * AcidRain signs up for a twitter account and downloads TTYtter
[18:19:34] <PantsOfChoco> its a single element hold on ill show ya
[18:19:37] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go.  enjoy folks.
[18:19:56] <AcidRain> we need cmd line facebook
[18:20:00] <dmsuperman> phew, he's gone
[18:20:01] <AcidRain> would make me feel leet as shit
[18:20:04] <dmsuperman> let's talk about his windows usage
[18:20:18] <AcidRain> i heard he uses win8
[18:20:20] <AcidRain> horrible thing
[18:20:25] <PantsOfChoco> also if you have any suggestions making my code prettier im all ears.
[18:20:28] <PantsOfChoco> windows 8 blows
[18:20:37] <AcidRain> i heard he spends 24*6.5hrs/weed on it
[18:20:41] <AcidRain> week*
[18:20:42] <AcidRain> lol
[18:20:47] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsfiddle.net/jYA6S/
[18:20:54] <PantsOfChoco> that much weed!?
[18:21:01] <AcidRain> lol. weed = week
[18:21:11] <PantsOfChoco> nah im pretty sure its weed
[18:21:22] <AcidRain> s/weed/week
[18:21:33] <AcidRain> yea weed :D
[18:21:46] <PantsOfChoco> my code in that fiddle, works for the initial click, but any after it doesnt work, however if i do document on click it clicks it like 40 times
[18:21:48] <AcidRain> NO OPS! lets run wild!
[18:22:11] <luvmyh0nda> phew, he's gone
[18:22:16] <luvmyh0nda> let's talk about his mac usage
[18:23:16] <compact> hey, I've got a script in php. that i want to execute when i click on "Add to Cart". how can i get jquery to action the php with passing the ID somehow of the product?
[18:23:27] <luvmyh0nda> compact: i got this one
[18:23:32] <dmsuperman> compact: jquery .ajax
[18:23:48] <luvmyh0nda> <button data-productid='33348' class='addtocart'>Add</button>
[18:24:34] <luvmyh0nda> then, get the value of data('productid') from the button & pass along
[18:24:45] <compact> great thanks
[18:24:48] <luvmyh0nda> one issue
[18:24:50] <luvmyh0nda> which i'm running into
[18:25:11] <luvmyh0nda> don't forget that when one ajax call is made, if you make another ajax call before it completes, it will disrupt the first call
[18:25:20] <dmsuperman> eh? that's not true
[18:25:28] <dmsuperman> that's why it's called ASYNCHRONOUS
[18:25:52] <luvmyh0nda> subsequent calls are cancelling the first ajax request
[18:26:01] <luvmyh0nda> eg, Hi, I have a page with buttons (shopping cart add/remove items). If a user clicks a second button prior to the previous ajax call completing, it aborts the previous call. How do I circumvent this? This was answered by Jattenalle last night, by wrapping them in a function(){}, but I'm wondering if someone could expand upon this...
[18:26:18] <dmsuperman> you need to paste your code
[18:26:36] <dmsuperman> because the problem you are describing doesn't happen with just a standard ajax call attached to an onclick handler
[18:26:42] <dmsuperman> 2 clicks = 2 ajax requests that each complete
[18:27:09] <dmsuperman> unless you have some kind of code which is explicitly cancelling the other event
[18:27:13] <Jattenalle> dmsuperman, i suspect he's doing it by calling a fixed function, ie, overriding the existing call so it no longer has a callback
[18:27:30] <Jattenalle> but never got code, so dunno
[18:27:34] <dmsuperman> lol
[18:27:50] <dmsuperman> yeah that would make sense. still, it wouldn't abort the previous call
[18:27:59] <dmsuperman> though I suppose that's semantics if the callback is detached
[18:29:16] <PantsOfChoco> $(document).on('click', '#additional_listing', function() why does that fire multiple times when i click my anchor tag?
[18:29:38] <dmsuperman> you probably defined the event handler multiple times?
[18:31:19] <dmsuperman> Jattenalle: On second thought wouldn't that mean the first request would just call the overridden callback?
[18:31:37] <dmsuperman> or barring that the original callback through some kind of garbage collection existing reference thing?
[18:34:17] <PantsOfChoco> ugh jquery and reloaded ajax pages are ruining my day
[18:34:56] <dmsuperman> PantsOfChoco: define the event handler in the top page, not in the dynamically loaded page
[18:35:02] <PantsOfChoco> i am
[18:35:06] <PantsOfChoco> i try in the document ready
[18:35:11] <PantsOfChoco> i try out of the document ready
[18:35:17] <dmsuperman> that's not what I'm talking about
[18:35:53] <dmsuperman> here's an easy way to tell, right above the line where you define that event handler, put an alert
[18:36:04] <dmsuperman> if you get more than one alert, then you know that code is being run multiple times
[18:36:09] <luvmyh0nda> i'm working on the code part, there's quite a bit there :\
[18:36:34] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: well paste it up if you want to figure it out. but again, from what you describe, making 2 ajax calls most definitely doesn't cancel the first one
[18:36:38] <dmsuperman> so there's something else there
[18:38:00] <PantsOfChoco> i figured it out god im dumb
[18:38:16] <dmsuperman> well don't leave us hanging
[18:38:31] <PantsOfChoco> it was that i had 2 anchors
[18:38:42] <PantsOfChoco> that had the same id
[18:38:44] <PantsOfChoco> and it broke everything
[18:38:45] <PantsOfChoco> ugh
[18:38:48] <PantsOfChoco> i hate things
[18:38:57] <dmsuperman> hah. yeah. I really prefer not to use IDs
[18:39:09] <PantsOfChoco> see im using the name for a variable
[18:39:20] <PantsOfChoco> and class would just seem overkill
[18:39:27] <PantsOfChoco> too much template work today my brain is fried
[18:39:32] <dmsuperman> how is a class overkill but an ID isn't?
[18:39:40] <dmsuperman> 3 characters difference
[18:39:47] <PantsOfChoco> OVERKILL
[18:39:53] <PantsOfChoco> 150% character difference
[18:40:04] <dmsuperman> well considering you just spent how long trying to resolve a non-issue
[18:40:09] <dmsuperman> ;)
[18:40:10] <luvmyh0nda> why not use data for variables?
[18:40:19] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: que?
[18:40:29] <PantsOfChoco> doesnt matter now it works im never going back
[18:40:47] <dmsuperman> well in the future PantsOfChoco try to use classes, it will make your life easier
[18:41:02] <dmsuperman> if you really need unique, use a class on the parent too
[18:41:16] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/XePGu/9/
[18:41:22] <dmsuperman> so if I have multiple a.deletePage  links I'll have one inside of a .welcome-page and one inside of an .about-us-page
[18:41:27] <luvmyh0nda> is a pretty good example of what's happening, click the "update" button
[18:42:03] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: well you're calling 6 click events
[18:42:07] <dmsuperman> er, 5
[18:42:16] <luvmyh0nda> yes
[18:42:18] <dmsuperman> You have 5 buttons which match that selector
[18:42:21] <luvmyh0nda> and the ajax calls are successful
[18:42:34] <luvmyh0nda> it's meant to emulate a user clicking multiple "add to cart" buttons
[18:42:38] <luvmyh0nda> prior to the first one completing.
[18:42:41] <vinex08> https://www.yellowfinbi.com/YFWebsite-Enterprise-Business-Intelligence-122363#data_Source
[18:42:43] <luvmyh0nda> if you'd like, i can add a timer to delay the clicks
[18:42:47] <vinex08> click on Enterprise
[18:42:51] <dmsuperman> what issue are you experience luvmyh0nda?
[18:42:53] <dmsuperman> what is the problem
[18:43:08] <vinex08> then on the sub menu and it will scroll down to that div, what's the name of that effect?
[18:43:08] <MikeR> yo
[18:43:09] <luvmyh0nda> when you click "Update" you will see that it clicks each button once, but only the last button updates
[18:43:25] <luvmyh0nda> the rest have the same text as before the call is made
[18:43:40] <luvmyh0nda> so success() is only calling once
[18:43:50] <luvmyh0nda> is it because the variable tb resets each time?
[18:43:57] <dmsuperman> I'm getting 5 alerts luvmyh0nda
[18:44:02] <dmsuperman> which means 5 success calls
[18:44:10] <dmsuperman> Are you not getting 5 alerts?
[18:44:21] <luvmyh0nda> the calls are completing, but success() is not firing
[18:44:24] <luvmyh0nda> well
[18:44:35] <luvmyh0nda> essentially the issue is that the variable tb gets reset
[18:44:43] <dmsuperman> success is firing, the alert is happening 5 times
[18:44:43] <PantsOfChoco> i dunno but i hate this yellowfin site
[18:44:52] <dmsuperman> that means definitely there are 5 successful ajax calls
[18:44:52] <vinex08> Why?
[18:45:04] <luvmyh0nda> each time the button is clicked, so I guess my question should be: how do I pass the button clicked into success:
[18:45:06] <vinex08> Marketing wise i think its good
[18:45:07] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: I suspect the issue is javascript scope resolution
[18:45:09] <PantsOfChoco> my internet is either real slow or its loading super slow
[18:45:15] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: which you can solve with a closure
[18:45:20] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: give me a sec
[18:45:32] <vinex08> Doesnt have loading prob to me
[18:45:38] <luvmyh0nda> i think i have it......
[18:45:49] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: actually real quick, try replacing the line tb = jQuery(this)
[18:45:53] <dmsuperman> with var tb = jQuery(this);
[18:46:06] <dmsuperman> I think that should retain the scope in your success callback
[18:46:10] <dmsuperman> if not you'll need a closure
[18:46:17] <vinex08> I think its called Scrollto ?
[18:47:32] <dmsuperman> Ok nevermind, var doesn't solve it (though I think I'm onto something, but I'll show you teh closure either way)
[18:47:39] <luvmyh0nda> yes, that's awesome
[18:47:43] <luvmyh0nda> it actually did solve it
[18:47:50] <luvmyh0nda> when you close the alerts it updates the buttons
[18:48:04] <luvmyh0nda> mine doesn't actually alert, it just replaces some html
[18:48:27] <luvmyh0nda> eg
[18:48:28] <luvmyh0nda> er
[18:48:29] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/XePGu/12/
[18:48:56] <dmsuperman> oh derp yeah I forgot to hit run after I added var
[18:49:07] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: so the issue is that you forgot to declare your variable tb
[18:49:11] <dmsuperman> you just started referencing it
[18:49:22] <luvmyh0nda> so essentially it's keeping the variable local in scope
[18:49:25] <dmsuperman> javascript when referencing an undeclared variable will default to global scope
[18:49:31] <luvmyh0nda> gotcha
[18:49:33] <dmsuperman> and yeah if you use var tb, that defines it in current scope
[18:49:48] <luvmyh0nda> it's funny
[18:50:04] <luvmyh0nda> i've been writing javascript since i was 14 years old, and there's so much i don't know, yet so many awesome things i've built
[18:50:15] <dmsuperman> yeah it's my fav language for that reason
[18:50:18] <Botanic_> I have a site http://tempestintheaether.org/damn/html/#ajax/loader.php?page=projects that when i try to click on ajax loaded links it doesnt work my ajax loader is http://codepad.org/XoShrrQv
[18:50:35] <luvmyh0nda> i just started with jquery like 3 years ago
[18:50:38] <luvmyh0nda> and was blown away
[18:50:42] <Botanic_> if anyone has any ideas how to make it load when clicking links that were ajax loaded
[18:50:51] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: if you're curious, because you wondered about the function(){} thing, here's how you solve it with a closure: http://jsfiddle.net/Et788/2/
[18:50:55] <luvmyh0nda> i actually learned on mIRC
[18:51:13] <dmsuperman> luvmyh0nda: basically all you're doing is force copying the global scoped variable into the local scope of an anonymous function
[18:51:32] <dmsuperman> by passing it as an argument
[18:51:58] <luvmyh0nda> oh so it's replacing button with tb
[18:52:24] <dmsuperman> yeah, it's passing a reference to tb as an argument called "button"
[18:52:34] <dmsuperman> you could technically use tb in place of button but it makes it confusing to read
[18:53:04] <dmsuperman> once there's a local reference javascript's code optimizer won't destroy that tb when you go to overwrite it in another scope
[18:53:05] <luvmyh0nda> can you do this with multiple variables such as (function(var1,var2)(var1,var2))
[18:53:09] <dmsuperman> yup!
[18:53:15] <luvmyh0nda> sick
[18:53:24] <dmsuperman> closures are very handy when you get into complicated async code
[18:53:36] <luvmyh0nda> for sure
[18:54:58] <luvmyh0nda> i know enough js to make things work... my baby is php though
[18:56:07] <dmsuperman> I've used PHP for about 4 years longer than JS but at this point I think I know more intricacies of JS
[18:56:26] <dmsuperman> I actually relatively understand how the JS optimizer/interpreter works
[18:56:36] <dmsuperman> whereas I know nothing under the hood for PHP
[18:56:56] <dmsuperman> just that it might be needle, haystack, but sometimes it's haystack, needle :P
[18:57:51] <dmsuperman> alright tho headed off....motorcycle time :D
[18:58:04] <AcidRain> im og in php. i only know enough js to xss
[18:58:35] <MichaelR> anyone have any idea to have to make a menu navigatable using the keyboard?
[18:58:57] <MichaelR> how to make*
[18:59:05] <MichaelR> wow my english is really bad tonight
[19:00:32] <AcidRain> MichaelR: use alt+tab to set focus to window. use tab to select menu item, use arrow keys to drop menu/go horizontally on menu. use enter to follow menu item.
[19:01:49] <MichaelR> I mean built into the website so its more intuative to the user. Like a videogame menu. Let me show you what I have (bonus points if you know what I'm imitating) mrabinovsky.com/test
[19:02:01] <MichaelR> if you hit the esc key it opens/closes/resets the menu
[19:02:41] <MichaelR> I want to be able to use the up and down keys to just move a selector over all the options, so that I don't have to tab around to get to them first.
[19:04:08] <luvmyh0nda> MichaelR: I'm going to go with some sort of onkey function() combined with using a class?
[19:05:09] <MichaelR> hmm so give each option a number and then on up/down key +/- one?
[19:05:20] <luvmyh0nda> essentially yes
[19:05:34] <luvmyh0nda> and on up/down or +/- just go to the next or previous class
[19:05:57] <luvmyh0nda> then right/space/whatever could be your click() function
[19:06:31] <MichaelR> alright, I think I got it. Thank you!
[19:07:09] <luvmyh0nda> i read your actual site, where are you located?
[19:08:22] <MichaelR> boston
[19:46:27] <compact> http://pastebin.com/mcrVBssm <---- any idea why its not getting the string value from a text box? I'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function

[19:57:20] <ashis> can any one help me with a jquery question
[19:57:59] <ashis> i have three buttons ,i will have to click the the third button and it will fade and appear on top of the first button
[19:59:30] <MichaelR> I can try, though I'm no JQwiz by any means. Why do you have so far?
[20:00:36] <MichaelR> I'm not certain but could you do it with 4 buttons, where button 4 is above button 1 and hidden until you press button three?
[20:00:55] <MichaelR> and then you can just use the .toggle method to switch between them.
[20:01:36] <MichaelR> ashis
[20:23:35] <Ansikt> ashis: use .prepend()
[20:24:08] <Ansikt> assuming $b1 and $b3 are your jQuery objects representing the buttons, you can just
[20:24:41] <Ansikt> $b3.onClick(function(){$b1.prepend($b3);})
[20:25:17] <Ansikt> sorry, that was dumb and wrong - let me try again
[20:25:33] <Ansikt> $b3.on("click", function(){$b1.prepend($b3);})
[20:30:55] <Jimmy_Rustles> I'm trying to use handlebars with jquery, and part of my handlebars template uses <button id="cancel">cancel</button>, but when I use the $('#button') selector jquery finds the template's button, and not the actual button (if that makes sense)
[20:32:02] <Jimmy_Rustles> $('#cancel') i mean
[20:33:16] <Jimmy_Rustles> not sure how to make jquery and handlebars play nicely here, as jquery expects unique id's, but the whole function of handlebars defeats that if i'm using it like this
[20:34:20] <Ansikt> Jimmy_Rustles, You shouldn't have multiple IDs, even with hbs
[20:49:31] <Keavon> Is there a way I can wrap this to shorten its syntax? http://pastebin.com/rZLA48Lt
[21:04:09] <i_am_learning> i have 4 radio buttons and when i click the last radio button i set a div to visible which reveals a div. Is there a way to make the div hidden once i click a different radio button?
[21:06:09] <fris> i_am_learning are you using .change?
[21:06:49] <i_am_learning> no i used on click then css("visibility", "visible")
[21:07:03] <fris> http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=faq&file=jquery-show-hide-div-using-radio-button
[21:07:23] <i_am_learning> will look at this thanks
[21:08:45] <Keavon> I got my question's answer on ##javascript http://pastebin.com/pj5Pm3e5
[21:10:08] <fris> i_am_learning http://jsfiddle.net/W49rf/ more basic version
[21:12:11] <i_am_learning> i see that when you click the opposite this calls .hide, but since i have 3 other radio buttons do i have to have a hide for each of them when any of them is clicked?
[21:12:33] <fris> you could do an each
[21:13:33] <Ansikt> i_am_learning: make a collection of all of them, .hide() them all, then .show() the one you want open
[21:15:02] <i_am_learning> ok thanks
[21:16:34] <fris> i_am_learning http://jsfiddle.net/s7zjL/
[21:22:23] <i_am_learning> cool thanks
[21:25:53] <fris> i_am_learning a bit shorter http://jsfiddle.net/92J39/
[21:30:09] <i_am_learning> lol thanks
[21:35:06] <Uhkis> i_am_learning: and even simpler http://jsfiddle.net/8mBeu/
[21:36:11] <i_am_learning> Uhkis: this is exactly what i was looking for.
[21:37:32] <i_am_learning> thanks for everyone who responded. Each example showed me something a little different, which I appreciate
[21:39:24] <Uhkis> :-)
[21:51:50] <trustyhank> jquery noob here (python guy) wants to know if im trying to do something stupid: trying to change class of div (for twitter colors : P) based on variable(could be 1, 0, -1) returned from view.  should i be using add / delete class?
[21:53:58] <Uhkis> trustyhank: or toggleClass
[21:54:24] <trustyhank> Uhkis: thank you, making sure im not going down wrong path
[22:00:59] <jotterbot1234> hey guys, suppose i have two strings "Pre Production" and "Production". How can I use .indexOf() or equivalent to match each string individually? and not have "Production" also include all instances of "Pre Production" ?
[22:02:47] <Jattenalle> jotterbot1234, regex
[22:03:15] <jotterbot1234> can you use regex with indexOf? isn't that .search?
[22:03:25] <Jattenalle> actually
[22:03:35] <Jattenalle> why dont you just: if(something == 'Production') ?
[22:03:41] <Jattenalle> i mean, if that's all it is...
[22:04:21] <jotterbot1234> Jattenalle: example strings for me to differentiate are: "Production - Camera Operator" vs "Pre Production - Pre Production Manager"
[22:05:22] <Jattenalle> well, with the first string, indexof will return 1
[22:05:29] <jotterbot1234> Jattenalle: basically I am getting a repsonse from an API, and I want to be able to push all of the "Pre Production - *" tasks to a "Pre Production" object or array
[22:05:29] <Jattenalle> because production is right there at the start
[22:05:41] <Jattenalle> with the second string indexof will return 5
[22:05:59] <Jattenalle> so.. if(indexOf(something) == 1) // is productrion, not pre production
[22:06:23] <Jattenalle> or you can check the leftmost n characters to see if they match 'Production'
[22:06:29] <jotterbot1234> Aaah! I see. I was doing if (tasks[i].Name.getText().indexOf("Pre Production")>-1)
[22:06:55] <jotterbot1234> which just tests that it is there is myunderstanding
[22:07:05] <Jattenalle> to get all Production, you'd modify that to be:  if (tasks[i].Name.getText().indexOf("Production")===1)
[22:07:37] <Jattenalle> or is it 0? i always forget if strings start on 0 or 1
[22:07:42] <Jattenalle> anyhow, you get the idea ;)
[22:07:53] <jotterbot1234> Jattenalle: I do thank you for clarifying for me! :D
[22:08:03] <Jattenalle> good luck
[22:08:09] <jotterbot1234> thanks mate :)
