[01:21:03] <Lucianah> hey guys
[01:21:08] <bomb> hey
[01:21:52] <Lucianah> i'm stuck for hours on this: 	jQuery('td[data-colname="fieldx"]').each(function( i, element ) {    var span = jQuery(this).html();
[01:22:09] <Lucianah> the var gets the inner html which contains 3 spans. i want the first one from it. how?
[01:24:21] <bomb> i can't parse it now
[01:24:40] <bomb> but there's a CSS selector to get first child
[01:25:09] <Lucianah> <td data-colname="fieldx"><span></span>,<span></span>,<span></span></td>  to become <td..><span></span></td>
[01:25:30] <Lucianah> ya but where i put this in there?
[01:25:37] <Lucianah> 'first:child'
[01:26:12] <Lucianah> i cant figure it out how to concatenate the jquery here
[01:26:56] <bomb> dude
[01:27:03] <Lucianah> can i jquery on a string? *shrug*
[01:27:34] <Lucianah> can i ask to select in the selection ?
[01:28:08] <bomb> td[data-colname="fieldx"]:first-child
[01:28:28] <Lucianah> oh i can do that?
[01:28:41] <bomb> ye
[01:29:12] <bomb> hopefully i understand you correctly
[01:32:58] <Lucianah> i guess it didnt work
[01:33:34] <Lucianah> like. i want to replace all the content inside the td with the first element
[01:34:01] <Lucianah> i feel it needs another selection inside the each maybe
[01:35:00] <Lucianah> something like var span = jQuery(this:'first:child'); ?
[01:35:43] <bomb> what do you want to do?
[01:36:12] <Lucianah> find all tds with that meta.  save the first span on a var. then replace the td content with the var
[01:37:13] <Lucianah> with that, i can see the td content jQuery('td[data-colname="Correção"]').each(function( i, element ) {  jQuery(this).html() }  i guess
[01:40:28] <Lucianah> hmm not
[01:40:35] <Lucianah> jQuery(element['first:child']).html()  not yet
[01:42:11] <bomb> aah gotcha dud
[01:43:37] <Lucianah> Oo
[01:43:52] <bomb> jQuery('td[data-colname="Correção"]').each(  keep thi
[01:43:58] <Lucianah> jQuery(this).html()  this gives me 3 spans :/
[01:44:31] <Lucianah> keep thi?
[01:44:35] <Lucianah> ah
[01:44:42] <Lucianah> rite
[01:48:34] <Lucianah> then wat?
[01:51:44] <bomb> yeah it gives you 3 spans
[01:51:57] <bomb> then do another jquerying with :first-child
[01:52:07] <Lucianah> then. i want to store the first span on a var, then replace the td html with it
[01:52:17] <bomb> yep yep
[01:52:22] <Lucianah> but how?
[01:52:30] <bomb> put var outside of the .each() block
[01:52:46] <Lucianah> var declaration you say?
[01:52:51] <bomb> yes
[01:53:33] <Lucianah> and inside each, i have this? html = jQuery(this).html();
[01:54:11] <Lucianah> how i jquery on the string?
[01:54:46] <bomb> what about this
[01:54:51] <bomb> inside that each block
[01:56:10] <bomb> jQuery(this).html(   /* you get first child's content here */     )
[01:56:38] <Lucianah> ya
[01:56:53] <bomb> usiing
[01:56:58] <bomb> this.first() i guess
[01:58:01] <Lucianah> this.first() is not a function
[02:02:26] <bomb> hmmm
[02:02:36] <bomb> what about
[02:02:45] <bomb> Jquery(this).first() Lucianah
[02:03:31] <Lucianah> oh look
[02:03:32] <Lucianah> html = jQuery(this).html();	span = jQuery(html).first();	jQuery(this).html(span);
[02:03:35] <Lucianah> this worked
[02:04:11] <Lucianah> this is not the html the this is the td selected by the each
[02:04:28] <Lucianah> if that 3 lines worked, can we make it shorter?
[02:04:30] <bomb> that's cool
[02:04:34] <bomb> i dono im new
[02:04:44] <Lucianah> me too :)
[02:05:02] <bomb> i believe you can make thos jquery's shorter
[02:05:04] <bomb> using $
[02:05:17] <Lucianah> i know you can call one thing after the other after the other after the other, on the same line somehow
[02:05:35] <Lucianah> i have seen it some day
[02:06:51] <bomb> yeah method chaining
[02:07:13] <bomb> sorry i'm also trying to eat now :>
[02:08:09] <Lucianah> ya that!
[02:08:27] <Lucianah> thats okay. its 3am anyway. i need to sleep :) thanks a lot man! =D
[02:09:16] <bomb> night
[04:47:55] <Gersh> What difference exist between .click and .onclick
[05:09:32] <Uhkis> Gersh: existence for one
[05:10:38] <Gersh> existence for one... meaning?
[05:48:57] <Uhkis> Gersh: there's no $.onclick
[05:49:44] <Gersh> ok
[06:34:45] <aiena> In $.post when passing an object for configuration. Like there is {"success":function() {},} can I add a "fail" key value pair ? E.g. $.ajax{"type":"POST","url":"/foo.php","success":function(){},"fail":function() {},"dataType":"json"});
[06:34:54] <aiena> *$.ajax sorry
[07:19:06] <hellyeah> can i use this https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/ to remove duplicate on array?
[07:20:00] <Uhkis> hellyeah: that's very literally what the description says :D
[07:21:10] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[07:31:55] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  got a question for tyou :D
[07:33:20] <hellyeah> <hellyeah> hmm [14:14:10] <hellyeah> while adding element to array i can check array has duplicate or not [14:14:24] <hellyeah> if that has duplicate value i can remove duplication from an awway [14:15:00] <hellyeah> i can store boolean value and until aray doesnt have such as 30 element i cannot make boolean value true [14:15:22] <hellyeah> if it reach the length of an array i can make boolean va
[07:34:19] <Uhkis> that's neither question or readable
[07:34:34] <hellyeah> let me try it again
[07:34:35] <Inari-> Hi again~

[09:24:42] <samsamek> my $.ajax call is calling the .fail() but without informing me why it’s failing in any way (no error in console log, http response 200 (OK)). Any idea how I can find out why my request is ‘failing’?
[09:34:05] <Elirips> Hello. If I have defined a css class 'foo', with for a property 'height: calc(999vh / 10);', how can I update the value '999vh' through jquery?
[09:34:14] <Elirips> Or: How can I modify a defined css-class from jquery?
[09:40:10] <ichti> element.css('height', 'calc(1337vh / 10)'); Probably works?
[09:40:54] <Elirips> yes, that works, but how can I read back that value?
[09:41:05] <Elirips> if I do element.css('height'); I will get a value like 13.76px
[09:41:15] <Elirips> but I would like to get back the original value
[09:43:38] <Elirips> never mind, i^ll add things as attr to the dom
[10:03:38] <Inari-> Whats the recommended way to change the colour of icons? https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html like the combobox example here uses a picture for it's arrow icon, but that means I can't just adjust it with color...
[10:37:45] <MikeD_> Inari-: that's a good question
[10:37:56] <MikeD_> i imagine you'll hate the answer as much as I do
[10:38:59] <Inari-> Well I just did away with the background-image via css and used :before and content xD
[11:01:36] <Inari-> Which doesn't seem to work well on mobile though :D
[11:06:37] <catbadger> good MORNING
[11:07:38] <catbadger> $h1=!('<div/>');$h1.html('GOOD MORNING');$('body').html($h1);
[11:07:46] <catbadger> damnit
[11:07:48] <catbadger> typo
[11:07:57] <catbadger> $h1=$('<div/>');$h1.html('GOOD MORNING');$('body').html($h1);
[11:08:13] <catbadger> lol that's wrong
[11:08:23] <catbadger> $h1=$('<div/>');$h1.html('GOOD MORNING');$('body').append($h1);
[11:08:33] <catbadger> better as it's nondestructive.
[11:09:33] <balance> hi
[11:10:00] <balance> anyone knows a good jquery plugin for a location picker? basically this http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Location-Picker-Place-Autocomplete-Plugin-For-Google-Maps-Location-Picker/ but this wasnt maintaned for 1year so I fear it might die
[11:11:17] <catbadger> lol just use leaflet?
[11:14:28] <balance> catbadger, thanks that looks better
[11:15:46] <catbadger> balance ;)
[11:15:57] <catbadger> yeah i <3 leaflet, but you need a tile server.
[11:16:16] <catbadger> so here's my repeater question for le day: I'm an experienced web dev who's still using jquery to make my UIs. not that there's anything i can't do with it, but I'm curious what front-end frame pays best. It lo0oks to be angularjs angular2 or react, from what I'm seeing in StackOverflow jobs.
[11:16:56] <catbadger> I'm seeing 100-180k for senior nodejs developers and i'm trying to decide if that's the way I should go as PHP and postgres jobs pay eff all...
[11:17:15] <taplar> maybe more of a #freenode or ##freelance question
[11:17:31] <balance> catbadger, not sure if I want to use openstreetmap though + leaflet doesn't support picking locations out of the box. :( at least from what I see in my little research now. but Ill look into it. are there any other such projects?
[11:18:00] <catbadger> you'd need to write aplugin balance.
[11:19:00] <balance> catbadger, yeah thanks
[12:12:40] <taplar> small OT question.  Is 'verbatim' not a common word anymore?
[12:14:52] <jphase> taplar_lunch: I'd think it's common, or at least as common as someone using/referencing something verbatim I suppose :/
[12:16:24] <Guest22723> so i'm filling some text then drawing an image to a canvas then trying to output the dataurl, the text is being saved but the image isn't? anyone have an idea why?
[12:30:29] <MikeD_> what color name would you call the code #C00C00  ?
[12:32:09] <MikeD_> "red" it is
[12:33:01] <Inari-> red or dark red, yeah
[12:33:26] <Uhkis> MikeD_ is coocoo for colors
[12:34:30] <MikeD_> yeah, it's a nice passive-aggressive color code for when someone wants color but doesn't want to tell me what they want
[12:34:39] <MikeD_> much like #FEA
[12:39:52] <MassDebates> FEA usually includes more than red, no?
[12:40:03] <MassDebates> Well, I suppose it could all be red if it was a shit model
[12:40:06] <MikeD_> yes
[12:40:06] <MassDebates> Zing! A pun
[12:40:21] <MikeD_> it's also the spanish word for ugly girl
[12:40:29] <MassDebates> AH, thanks MikeD_ I was hoping someone would get the finite element analysis joke
[12:40:33] <MassDebates> I feel fulfilled
[12:41:24] <MikeD_> my nerd credz are lacking
[12:42:18] <MikeD_> oh, that was just a TLA reference
[12:53:21] <Uhkis> http://bada55.io/
[12:55:57] <MassDebates> I love bada55
[14:03:30] <Elirips> Any hints how to: duplicate a div with all its children?
[14:04:09] <Elirips> I need to: Shrink a div by 50%, then move it upwards 50%, then duplicate it and place below the original one
[14:05:41] <taplar> you just want to duplicate the markup?
[14:20:35] <catbadger> I'm back
[14:21:47] <catbadger> anyone freelancing? It's been awhile since I needed to look outside my network for sidework.
[14:24:49] <TimCoal> what do you do?
[14:25:08] <MassDebates> Side work is all we do it seems like ><
[14:25:51] <TimCoal> unless side work is a technology i've not heard of, what side work
[14:26:09] <catbadger> I'm a jquery/javascript/php fullstack programmer who builds php apis and html5 frontends. I am learning cordova and nodejs as well. where do people go to find it now? I'm outta the loop.
[14:26:41] <TimCoal> me too
[14:26:46] <TimCoal> what do you charge?
[14:27:00] <catbadger> you first.
[14:27:04] <TimCoal> do you do SVG?
[14:27:43] <catbadger> I can, but i tend to just use php to render what I want in png with GD or imagick.
[14:27:48] <catbadger> in php to a png
[14:27:50] <catbadger> lol
[14:28:05] <catbadger> depends on project really
[14:28:05] <TimCoal> no so interactive
[14:29:11] <TimCoal> no budet for hireing so unless you take equity
[14:32:01] <DelphiWorld__> hey guys
[14:32:12] <Inari-> Hi
[14:32:15] <DelphiWorld__> i am setting the contento f a div dynamicaly using jQuery
[14:32:18] <catbadger> TimCoal what?
[14:32:33] <DelphiWorld__> but i want to write a emogy on it, is it pocible to write it just by characters?
[14:33:10] <Inari-> emogy? emoji?
[14:33:26] <DelphiWorld__> like i want to write a red circkle, Inari-
[14:35:35] <DelphiWorld__> got me Inari- ?
[14:35:51] <Inari-> Not really, no
[14:36:21] <DelphiWorld__> Inari-: those emoji simbolezs you find mostly in chat apps
[14:37:12] <Inari-> Well, they're unicode
[15:03:36] <catbadger> TimCoal no budget for hiring? Can my kids eat equity?
[15:11:38] <Inari-> catbadger: Can your kids eat money? :D
[15:45:57] <Trel> Can jquery easily toggle a css class property?  For example toggle display on a CSS class rather than on a specific object?
[15:47:42] <jphase> Trel: .toggleClass()
[15:48:19] <jphase> if you mean the attribute that is
[15:48:49] <taplar> jqueery wouldn't toggle a css rule
[15:49:14] <taplar> toggle changes the classList of the elements
[15:49:34] <Trel> jphase: I don't mean apply/unapply the class.  I mean change the class property itself.
[15:49:37] <taplar> or the style.display if you are using it to show/hide
[15:49:43] <jphase> you can use .css and pass an empty value on a css property, but it would only override it with style attribute
[15:49:45] <jphase> kinda ghetto imo
[15:49:50] <taplar> right, no.  jquery doesn't change css rules
[15:50:26] <Trel> So if my main goal is to show/hide the class, would the better option then be to use .toggle() on a $(".class") option?  (I'm super new to jquery)
[15:50:45] <taplar> so we need to clarify
[15:50:49] <taplar> you don't hide classes
[15:50:52] <taplar> you hide elements
[15:51:02] <taplar> you can use classes to find elements, but you don't hide a class
[15:51:17] <taplar> comprende?
[15:51:40] <Trel> Yes, I'm phrasing it wrong.  I want to hide/show everything with a specific class.
[15:51:51] <jphase> $('.class').hide()
[15:51:52] <taplar> then you use show() or hide() or toggle()
[15:51:53] <jphase> or .show()
[15:51:55] <jphase> ^
[15:52:05] <Trel> Any reason not to use toggle() from the get go?
[15:52:13] <taplar> show()/hide() are more explicit
[15:52:21] <taplar> you know what is going to happen
[15:52:55] <jphase> (something else could easily use .toggle() and conflict with your code)
[15:53:08] <taplar> but hide() would always hide them, and the same with show
[15:53:18] <taplar> where as if it got wonky, toggle wouldn't fix the wonkyness
[15:53:23] <Trel> It's a single button though to show/hide a sidebar, so it's not explicit what should be happening, no?  The goal is to toggle the current state.  Should I instead be using an if/else to check the current state?
[15:53:46] <jphase> if your code is the only code targeting to toggle on that element, then that's "safe"
[15:53:48] <taplar> you can go either way.  it's some what personal coding style
[15:54:01] <Trel> Yeah, in this case it's just my code.
[15:57:26] <Trel> Thanks
[16:16:35] <gambl0re> whats the best way to recreate this game? https://www.marketjs.com/item/snowball-fight
[16:18:13] <catbadger> gambl0re step 1: learn to code... step 2??? step 3: play your new game!!!
[16:18:47] <catbadger> couldn't help myself...
[16:23:29] <Trel> Got one more issue, I can't seem to get delay to work at all.
[16:23:37] <Trel> It acts like nothing is there.
[16:24:23] <Trel> The line I have is $(".class").delay(1000).hide();
[16:24:36] <taplar> look at the api for delay
[16:24:38] <gambl0re> Trel, are you talking to me?
[16:24:43] <taplar> it's not a replacement for settimeout
[16:25:34] <taplar> unless you are using the jquery ui version of show and hide which allow for a duration (i think it is just the ui versions), show and hide do not animate
[16:25:55] <Trel> Asking in general, not to anyone specific. And oh, the delay only applies to animations, not any command?
[16:26:06] <taplar> right
[16:26:26] <Trel> I'm not familiar much with JS, so I need to look up settimeout then.
[16:26:35] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/delay/ yellow paragraph
[16:27:14] <Trel> That was just coincidence that I was using hide, I was having issues with a few things that were effects too, but I may have been doing it wrong there.
[16:34:47] <Trel> Thanks, got it working with setTimeout.
[16:35:58] <Trel> Wanted something to disappear AFTER an animation finished, so I needed to delay it for the duration.
[17:13:17] <catbadger> Trel, how were you animating?
[17:13:26] <catbadger> you should probably have a callback, not a timeout
[17:14:04] <taplar> unless it's css
[17:30:49] <catbadger> taplar is right. as usual
[17:31:03] <taplar> lies
[17:31:40] <catbadger> :D
[18:32:04] <catbadger> HOW DO I MONEY?
[18:35:39] <robertmaxrees> get a good job.
[18:35:57] <catbadger> lol I need to money better.
[18:36:18] <robertmaxrees> https://twitter.com/dril/status/384408932061417472?lang=en
[18:36:59] <catbadger> lol
[19:53:07] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you about?
[20:03:23] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 along with over 400 other people ;)
[20:04:47] <Al_nz1> this is slightly OT - will you accept a PM?
[20:04:52] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[20:10:37] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 http://jsfiddle.net/mmXV5/1456/ so the issue is this fiddle doesn't work?
[20:10:46] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy - you're not including the plugin there.
[20:11:45] <Al_nz1> where not including it?
[20:11:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:11:58] <robertmaxrees> that question is backwards hahaha
[20:12:03] <robertmaxrees> you have to include the plugin to use it.
[20:12:48] <Al_nz1> you mean on the left hand side/
[20:12:55] <Al_nz1> in external resources?
[20:13:05] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/BETGCXv.png
[20:13:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[20:13:15] <robertmaxrees> the code doesn't magically exist.
[20:13:32] <Al_nz1> it works on this fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/mmXV5/1/
[20:13:41] <Al_nz1> and he hasnt included it in external resources?
[20:14:02] <Al_nz1> oh - he included the whole source?
[20:14:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  which is a weird thing to do.
[20:14:33] <Al_nz1> ok, so I should just play with the first few lines
[20:14:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:14:45] <robertmaxrees> just include the plugin.
[20:14:51] <Al_nz1> or that
[20:15:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/mmXV5/1458/
[20:15:28] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[20:20:08] <Al_nz1> see the error messages - password_to_short: "The password is too short" - i cant see in the doc where you specify the key value ie, password_to_short for a given rule?
[20:20:18] <robertmaxrees> link to docs?
[20:20:31] <Al_nz1> https://github.com/ablanco/jquery.pwstrength.bootstrap
[20:22:18] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ablanco/jquery.pwstrength.bootstrap/blob/d6c691620d00c35e97805decf3136bdb82e77061/CHANGES.md#breaking-changes
[20:22:28] <robertmaxrees> the current release for that plugin does things differently.
[20:25:05] <Al_nz1> Ok, but I cant even see where in examples folder there is a example of the new way? with this translations
[20:25:35] <Al_nz1> examples/bootstrap3 has 1 js file with one line in it
[20:25:42] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/6nEMxs7.png
[20:25:59] <Al_nz1> oh - he has put the js inline in the index.html
[20:26:50] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/vYSTQqS.png
[20:27:05] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/y6kwQuZ.png
[20:27:11] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to find this stuff out.
[20:29:04] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: those two files you found in the screenie are his source files - it doesnt tell me how to impliment it
[20:29:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:29:49] <robertmaxrees> you're not getting it.
[20:30:10] <robertmaxrees> so you know how, in javascript, you use variables and objects?
[20:30:56] <Al_nz1> yes
[20:31:30] <robertmaxrees> cool.  so what's the hint when you see https://i.imgur.com/DPK0Q4V.png
[20:31:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:33:05] <Al_nz1> yeah I see wordMinLength
[20:33:17] <Al_nz1> and there is a message there
[20:33:25] <Al_nz1> so I dont know why I need to override it
[20:33:26] <robertmaxrees> great.  so what does that tell you?
[20:33:46] <Al_nz1> it tells me remove my error messages alltogether and use defaults
[20:34:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:34:24] <robertmaxrees> no
[20:35:22] <Al_nz1>  errorMessages:{ wordMinLength: "The password is too short" } <- didnt work either
[20:35:52] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ablanco/jquery.pwstrength.bootstrap#internationalization-i18n
[20:36:14] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ablanco/jquery.pwstrength.bootstrap#how-to-customize-the-translation-function
[20:37:07] <Al_nz1> why do I need to customise tranaslation - I am working in English
[20:37:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:37:47] <robertmaxrees> because you want to override those values.
[20:38:13] <Al_nz1> but I dont - for now, I am happy with the default error messages
[20:38:18] <Al_nz1> for a given rule
[20:38:30] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:38:36] <robertmaxrees> then why are you asking how to change them?
[20:39:29] <Al_nz1> "for now" I am just happy to get a error for a given rule
[20:39:33] <Al_nz1> note the for now
[20:39:41] <robertmaxrees> and now you know how to change them later.
[20:39:44] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[20:41:32] <Al_nz1> no problem not solved - there are two rules in the fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/mmXV5/1464/ a too short and a special character but no error is appearing if i dont include special chart
[20:41:44] <Al_nz1> char
[20:46:18] <Al_nz1> still here robertmaxrees?
[20:47:55] <robertmaxrees> walked away for a second.
[20:47:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[20:48:56] <robertmaxrees> show me the broken case./
[20:49:28] <Al_nz1> http://jsfiddle.net/mmXV5/1464/
[20:50:07] <robertmaxrees> so you want to error if there's no special character?
[20:52:12] <Al_nz1> yip - because that rule is on I would expect a error
[20:55:13] <Al_nz1> ?
[20:55:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:55:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm reading the docs for you.
[20:57:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd read up on what the "score" means.
[20:57:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm gonna guess that's part of the issue.
[20:58:40] <Al_nz1> hmmm - so much for the docs, but I will take a look
[20:59:24] <robertmaxrees> https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/
[20:59:58] <robertmaxrees> looks like it weights different rules in different ways and then uses that to determine validity of a password
[21:00:45] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a simple "if it doesn't have x don't allow the password"
[21:02:37] <Al_nz1> but there is a special character rule - and if there is no special character surely it would be logical to let the user know why there password sucks
[21:02:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that plugin works it seems.
[21:03:14] <Al_nz1> i need to enforce a certain score?
[21:03:30] <robertmaxrees> looks like it.  that blog post explains the system in use by the plugin.
[21:04:08] <Al_nz1> so what the heck does the rule wordOneSpecialChar: true, enforce then?
[21:04:26] <robertmaxrees> it activates that as apart of the scoring system i'm guessing.,
[21:04:41] <Al_nz1> right
[21:05:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:05:37] <Al_nz1> "right" as in i get what you are saying
[21:05:45] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[21:05:49] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[21:06:35] <Al_nz1> so I need to see if there is a option to enforce what is the minium score to be an acceptable password
[21:06:54] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ablanco/jquery.pwstrength.bootstrap/blob/master/OPTIONS.md#rules
[21:07:03] <robertmaxrees> or adjust the scores to better suit what you're defining as "secure"
[21:07:31] <robertmaxrees> protip: i would either reevaluate what you're defining as a "bad password" or choose another plugin.
[21:07:57] <robertmaxrees> just because a password doesn't contain a special character automatically makes it bad.  a lot more goes into than that.
[21:08:22] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yip I agree, but for brute force the permutations rises dramatically
[21:08:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:08:36] <Al_nz1> when your character set increases

[21:09:11] <robertmaxrees> https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/
[21:10:30] <robertmaxrees> but sure ;)
[21:10:36] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is the issue here lol
[21:10:39] <robertmaxrees> i have to leave.
[21:10:40] <robertmaxrees> bye
[21:11:50] <Al_nz1> thanks
[22:41:37] <micros> hello. I have an html <select> tag and attempt to remove the disabled property without much luck.  Any idea whats going on? thanks.  $("selconnsupervisionoutputnumber").removeAttr("disabled");
[22:45:34] <micros> i also tried .prop("disabled", false) - no luck either
