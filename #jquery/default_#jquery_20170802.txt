[08:20:03] <Inari-> Hi there!
[08:20:56] <Inari-> So doing this.input = $("<input>").autocomplete({/*options*/}); seems to work fine, I can e.g.  then do this.input.autocomplete("widget");
[08:21:36] <Inari-> But doing this.input = $("<input>"); $.ui.autocomplete.call(this.input, {/*options*/}); doesn't work?
[08:22:03] <Inari-> When I then try this.input.autocomplete("widget") it says "cannot call methods on autocomplete prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'widget'"
[08:23:18] <Inari-> Or maybe I'm using the wrong one and it woudl be $.fn.autocomplete
[08:24:11] <Inari-> Seems so <.<
[08:26:44] <Inari-> Why would you just overwrite $.fn.autocomplete, gah!
[08:29:52] <Inari-> Is there some way to load a copy of the normal jQuery autocomplete function locally into my script? something like var autocomplete = require("jquery-autocomplete.js")?
[08:44:18] <jak2000> var NoEmb = $("#xnoemb").val();   and if (NoEmb.isNumeric()) {   <--- here thow a error: Uncaught TypeError: NoEmb.isNumeric() is not a function i use jquery version: jquery-1.11.3.min.js   why?
[08:45:55] <Uhkis> jak2000: because NoEmb is a string, not jquery object
[08:48:03] <jak2000> Uhkis how to check if the content is only numeric?
[08:48:19] <jak2000> and this worked in other jquery version...
[08:48:30] <Uhkis> no it didnt
[08:48:43] <Uhkis> $.isNumeric(yourstring) would work
[08:48:43] <jak2000> strange....
[08:50:05] <jak2000> testing thanks
[09:16:15] <chobocoder> Hi, how do I add a class to a single button that is being hovered over instead of all buttons? - https://jsfiddle.net/jaq8cbeh/
[09:34:07] <chobocoder> How do I add a class to a single button that is being hovered over instead of all buttons? - https://jsfiddle.net/jaq8cbeh/
[09:35:17] <Uhkis> chobocoder: this instead of the class selector
[09:37:28] <chobocoder> uhkis: I've tried this but I checking first if the checkbox is hovered over, then changing the button background colour.
[09:45:07] <neo_> hi guys , I made map and need to do tooltip when hover under towns must show tooltip with name of town

[09:51:41] <itaipu> \wc
[10:14:56] <neo__> need to do
[10:16:14] <neo__> go right there https://www.amcharts.com/demos/us-heat-map/?theme=none
[10:16:15] <taplar> hmm?
[10:16:21] <neo__> I need this tooltip
[10:16:43] <neo__> insert on my map https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/jLMNZB
[10:18:04] <lencl> My friend is taking a class in jquery and they cover jwplayer
[10:18:20] <lencl> is that like what's hot on jquery or something? I don't see how they focus on one plugin
[10:18:40] <taplar> neo__: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102457/how-to-create-an-svg-tooltip-like-box#12904788  you can google for things like this
[10:19:08] <neo__> ok, to try do it
[10:19:21] <taplar> lencl: i'm not sure that jqplayer is jquery based
[10:19:29] <taplar> * jwplayer
[10:20:09] <lencl> taplar: ah good point
[10:20:17] <lencl> you're right
[10:20:28] <lencl> anyway i gotta leave now
[10:20:38] <lencl> it's all about react
[10:20:44] * lencl throws React gang signs
[10:20:54] <taplar> ok
[10:21:02] <Uhkis> PATENTS
[10:21:13] <taplar> ?
[10:21:14] * lencl shoots everyone as part of React drive-by
[10:22:13] <Uhkis> taplar: react has this "facebook owns you" clause in their license
[10:22:26] <taplar> oh sure
[10:22:40] <taplar> which is why i'm using vue instead, :)
[10:46:18] <neo__> don't know how make that tooltip
[12:26:35] <Inari-> Hah I fixed it!
[12:28:45] <robertmaxrees> grats!
[12:28:47] <robertmaxrees> :D
[12:51:18] <Ice_Strike> Any idea why this won't work? https://jsfiddle.net/46n6gp7h/
[12:51:36] <Ice_Strike> If you select from first dropdown then it should also select second dropdown
[12:51:49] <Ice_Strike> whatever you have selected from first dropdown.
[12:52:26] <Inari-> Is there supposed to be anythign there aside the js code?
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike err, huh?
[12:53:05] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike are you trying to make two selects match their value?
[12:53:26] <Ice_Strike> two selects dropdown have same <options>
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> wrong approach then :)
[12:54:25] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike https://jsfiddle.net/46n6gp7h/1/
[12:54:43] <Ice_Strike> Ohhhh
[12:54:57] <Ice_Strike> .val()
[12:54:57] <Ice_Strike> Hmm
[12:55:05] <Ice_Strike> I thought that would overwrite the content.
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> .val() sets the value.
[12:55:40] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating it with .text() / .html()
[12:55:57] <Ice_Strike> Yea I meant .val() sets the value :P
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[12:56:13] <Ice_Strike> But in that case, it not really setting the value in dropdown isnt it? :P
[12:56:22] <Ice_Strike> but selecting :P
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> it's setting the value.
[12:56:31] <Ice_Strike> I tested it, it is working.
[12:56:38] <robertmaxrees> the value of the dropdown is the current selected option
[12:59:01] <Ice_Strike> (y)
[13:30:00] <taplar> i like it when s.o. posts pop up and you go to them and then they are deleted.  like... wtf?  lol.  like the poster had a brain fart
[13:32:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:36:09] <ashleylaing> Does anyone have advice on making divs shuffle randomly and still not pile up on each other with javacsript or jQuery?
[13:38:21] <taplar> what do you mean pile up?
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> and define "shuffle randomly"
[13:38:58] <taplar> sounds like maybe your after a masonry like plugin
[13:39:12] <ashleylaing> I want the divs to shuffle randomly, but I have one that goes underneath another one cuz of position
[13:39:54] <ashleylaing> i have math random picking out of 3 functions randomly to decide moving which divs
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> check to see if there's a collision and rerun the randomization at that point if so.
[13:41:20] <taplar> are you selecting 2/3 elements?
[13:42:03] <taplar> cause if so you could flip the logic and randomly pick which one doesn't move
[13:44:29] <randymarsh9> hey peeps
[13:44:34] <randymarsh9> is there a way to execute code only when a $.getJSON call finishes?
[13:44:51] <taplar> it accepts a success callback
[13:44:56] <taplar> checkout the docs
[13:45:28] <randymarsh9> ok i will take a look thanks
[13:45:39] <taplar> should always be your first stop, btw, ;)
[13:45:56] <randymarsh9> i just want to make sure i'm doing it the right way
[13:46:12] <taplar> the api won't show you that?
[13:46:20] <ashleylaing> @taplar I’m selecting 2 out of 3 at a time….and thanks
[13:46:49] <taplar> ashleylaing: then yeah, flip the logic and you don't have to worry about the collision checking
[13:46:52] <randymarsh9> it will but maybe what i'm trying to accomplish uses something different than the success callback
[13:47:03] <randymarsh9> but anyway i'll go with that first
[13:47:06] <taplar> then you get to pop in here and ask, :)
[13:47:43] <taplar> whole teach a man to fish thing
[13:51:24] <randymarsh9> taplar: thanks for trying to teach me how to fish :)
[13:52:16] <taplar> yup yup
[14:50:52] <tycoon177> is there a way that i can stop a checkbox from changing state without it interfering with the serialize() method? if i disable the checkbox, serialize no longer picks it up
[14:51:58] <taplar> you could try setting the pointer-events to false or none
[14:52:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/avdemvtp/
[14:53:29] <tycoon177> taplar: perfect. thanks!
[14:53:58] <tycoon177> didn't know that css could be the solution here :)
[14:54:40] <tycoon177> hmm, it seems like pointer-events are not supported by all major browsers though, according to caniuse
[14:56:10] <taplar> ah
[15:00:38] <tycoon177> taplar: looks like i was looking at some weird specification. they are supported ~ 88-89% globally
[15:01:04] <taplar> you might could get 100% with some hidden field
[15:06:23] <tycoon177> you know, i could've just gotten the value right before disabling the fields...that would've worked too
[15:06:28] <tycoon177> fuuuuuuu
[17:19:17] <robertamxrees> weeeeeeeee
[17:19:28] <taplar> boom
[17:23:36] <taplar> saw a guy trying to build sql in js in s.o. earlier
[17:23:49] <robertamxrees> no
[17:24:05] <taplar> pointed it out like 4 comments down, and the shaming commenced, lol
[17:25:10] <robertamxrees> ahhaha
[17:33:56] <taplar> i got the start of A Thousand Suns stuck in my head today
[17:34:50] <robertamxrees> interesting tune
[17:35:25] <taplar> there was a point that i had that disk on constant repeat.  definitely an interesting album
[17:35:44] <tycoon177> you're telling me that i shouldn't be crafting sql queries in javascript? :P
[17:35:58] <robertamxrees> D:
[17:36:04] <taplar> i'm simply saying, go have a beer and think it over
[17:36:32] <taplar> if at some point you don't go....wait.... fk!    then, welp
[17:36:54] * taplar grumbles that robert for using welp
[17:37:02] <taplar> r/that/at
[17:41:58] <robertamxrees> hahahaha

[17:43:36] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:43:46] <taplar> bonjour

[17:45:09] <taplar> bon-jouer-no
[17:45:53] <taplar> do you have any gray-poop-on for my sandwich?
[17:46:06] * taplar wanders off
[19:02:35] <randymarsh9> hey peeps
[19:03:09] <randymarsh9> is there a way to chain .keyup functions for multiple ids?
[19:05:59] <randymarsh9> e.g if i have $("#input-field1").keyup(function(){
[19:06:16] <randymarsh9> is there a way to include #input-field2, #input-field3 in the same line?
[19:08:37] <randymarsh9> nvm found the answer thx
[20:08:49] <BionicBunny> Hi guys. So I tried searching this on StackOverflow and all over the web and can't find a way to do this... I'm trying to add the "Chosen" plugin (it's a thing similar to select2 to allow searching in "select" dropdown fields to an existing web app. I'm able to make it work for elements that are already loaded on the page.
[20:09:26] <BionicBunny> However, this app adds fields dynamically. On those fields, the select elements look like they've been "chosen-fied", but clicking doesn't work. I'm presuming I need to re-"chosen-fy" these on each change, right? How could I perform this?
[22:30:38] <FishPencil> How do I change an elements style if the element is replaced on events? Maybe $("head").append("<style>...</style>")?
[22:41:31] <poboy> there doesn't seem to be a difference between .fadeIn()  and .fadeIn("fast").  Is there a reason to use fast?
[22:42:53] <poboy> ok, I guess there is a very small difference
[22:45:34] <arunkumar413> Is there is library to parse svg path commands
[22:46:19] <arunkumar413> I came across a few but they r based on node js and r server side
