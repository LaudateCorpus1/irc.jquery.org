[00:33:25] <HowardwLo> ello! is it possible to find every $(‘.special-form’) and replace each forms action attribute with its data-new-action attribute?
[00:35:46] <HowardwLo> oh i need a loop. thats why
[02:07:52] <Kartagis> hello
[02:09:41] <Kartagis> I'm querying a webservice with ajax (getting fields, editing them and submitting back). however, I am getting wrong datetime error for a field I'm not even retrieving or submitting. any ideas?
[02:09:58] <Kartagis> date format*
[02:19:23] <Uhkis> sounds like a backend problem to me
[02:26:38] <Kartagis> Uhkis: one of the fields on the node is that, but I'm never retrieving it
[02:31:53] <Uhkis> maybe its a required field
[02:34:55] <pbiendl> Hey Guys! Some time ago i knew a js script/lib (i thought it was a jQ Plugin) which provided a "fire event wenn element is in viewport" functionality, but i don't know the name anymore! :D Does someone know this script? I know i can write this by myself, but this script had some other neat features ootb
[02:36:16] <pbiendl> Already found ScrollMagic, but i don't think that's the one i'm looking for
[02:37:52] <pbiendl> Ah, nevermind, found it :) It's called "ScrollFire"
[02:40:26] <Uhkis> pbiendl: theres also waypoints and lots of others
[02:41:37] <pbiendl> Oh ok, will try this out also Uhkis, because ScrollFire is part of materializecss (a whole frontend framework) and i only need this small jQ plugin
[02:41:41] <pbiendl> Thanks!
[02:43:32] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I checked, it's not
[03:33:02] <Dorian-Grim> http://pastebin.com/7BBRgJEx - I have this code, which works all the time on Chrome, but sporadically on IE, basically my index from $_POST, does not exist. But only on IE... guys on php said to try seek help here
[03:44:36] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: is the console.log always giving you the expected value in ie?
[03:44:57] <Dorian-Grim> Yes Cork
[03:45:09] <Cork> hmm, weird
[03:45:19] <Cork> no clue, never had any problem with xhr post data
[03:45:27] <Dorian-Grim> maybe change from post to get
[03:45:45] <Dorian-Grim> But if I do that, the index is always blank
[03:45:55] <Dorian-Grim> I really don't know. I need help
[03:48:26] <Uhkis> Dorian-Grim: does the $_POST look same on both browsers?
[03:49:59] <Dorian-Grim> what do you mean Uhkis?
[03:50:18] <Dorian-Grim> in nameGlimpse.php I have $nameGlimpse = $_POST['tables'];
[03:50:40] <Dorian-Grim> On Chrome $nameGlimpse is always isset
[03:50:52] <Dorian-Grim> On IE it sporadically is blank
[03:50:56] <Uhkis> look at the full post, not that index
[03:51:22] <Dorian-Grim> $nameGlimpse as a var is blank on IE sporadically, on Chrome never
[03:51:36] <Dorian-Grim> How would I look at the post. I don't know another method
[03:51:48] <Uhkis> just checked what sporadically means, so it's sometimes blank
[03:51:56] <Dorian-Grim> yes man
[03:52:07] <Dorian-Grim> sorry for the rare word
[03:52:18] <Dorian-Grim> sometimes :D, more suited
[03:52:54] <Uhkis> but otherwise the post is there?
[03:53:38] <Dorian-Grim> when $nameGlimpse isset, it works
[03:54:43] <Uhkis> debug the whole $_POST, not just that tables index
[03:54:56] <Uhkis> maybe it intermittenly times out or something
[04:04:22] <konrados> morning :)
[04:07:27] <konrados> On most of linux distribution, middle click pastes text to the input fields right? And now - it does NOT trigger the .change event o_O I tried to react to the .click event too, and it does fire, but *before* the text appears in the text input. What's the solution? Is there anything else than playing with settimeout?
[04:09:22] <Uhkis> try input
[04:11:41] <konrados> Uhkis: you were talking to me? Then can you please explain? This is a <input type = 'text'>
[04:12:27] <Uhkis> i meant input event: $(element).on('input', function(){do stuff});
[04:13:37] <konrados> Uhkis: I didn't now such an event even exists, I'll give it a try
[04:14:08] <AdamPDotty> I still believe in change.
[04:14:12] <crockstylie> Hi my jQuerry fellows :)
[04:16:44] <konrados> Uhkis it works, thank you very much!
[04:17:12] <Uhkis> :)
[04:33:56] <skywater> hi any idea how to post data in a form in xml string? I now how to parse in XML, but question is when someone enters fields in form and then clicks post that the data will be put in xml and then send to the post url?
[04:37:33] <Numline1> Hello guys. I've received this request at work to change datepicker element to show only certain range of dates
[04:38:00] <Numline1> currently it's listable up to 1.1.1970. Is there any option exposed via API that'll limit back selection to eg 1.1.2015?
[05:00:44] <crockstylie> Hi :) I display a list from mysql with load() function. As a callback inside this load() function I have a form function which adds in my db a new entry. Ther problem is that once the form submitted, the page is not reloaded because it's an ajax powered form. Can I use my load function as a callBack in my form function ? : http://pastebin.com/kBRYrCcE
[05:03:26] <crockstylie> Anyway, I found out that yes :)
[05:03:51] <crockstylie> javascript is definitely my favourite ouh yeah ^^
[05:12:43] <Dulcin> Hi, I have a button that sends a jQuery ajax get request ($.get()) to the server, and it repsonse with an empty HttpResponse(). I was hoping this would refresh the current page, but it doesn't. How would I go and do that (without a javascript refresh)
[05:21:29] <AdamPDotty> The whole point of ajax was not to refresh the page.
[05:35:06] <diksha> hi
[05:35:26] <diksha> is there anyone familiar with InstaGram API ?
[05:36:11] <bounceman> Any ideas how I can do this? https://jsfiddle.net/q4eu7mLL/ What I am doing is that if focusout on the last input then add another input. However it does only work once, the function is intended to keep adding inputs as long as the last input has a value and is focused out.
[05:41:53] <bounceman> I forgot the class in the above examples, it is a typo ignore it
[05:53:11] <bounceman> nvm solves it
[07:20:53] <charz_> hello world
[07:21:50] <taplar> buenos dias
[07:22:16] <charz_> https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/ i try to get rid of a textarea char counter. do i have a problem with line 8? any way to get this fixed without parent() ?
[07:22:26] <charz_> hello taplar
[07:24:21] <taplar> the parent of your field3 is fc-tbxfield3
[07:25:01] <taplar> i'm assuming your probably after closest('fieldset') instead
[07:25:09] <charz_> hm ah ye
[07:25:33] <charz_> instead of $this.parent()
[07:26:17] <charz_> taplar: like that? https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/9/
[07:26:45] <taplar> $this.clos...
[07:27:00] <taplar> it's a jQuery method, ;)
[07:27:33] <charz_> yeye my bad
[07:27:54] <charz_> https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/10/ but ffs its runs 30min ago.
[07:28:08] <charz_> now i broke it im blind.
[07:29:27] <taplar> start console.log your variables and make sure they're right
[07:30:17] <Cork> charz_: also i recommend using on('input' instead of .keyup(
[07:30:32] <Cork> as keyup can break if the user holds down a key
[07:30:41] <Cork> (while input can't)
[07:30:43] <charz_> hm tru
[07:31:07] <taplar> though doesn't account for pasting with the mouse
[07:31:15] <charz_> but i can fix that at the end
[07:31:45] <charz_> atm its doesnt work
[07:31:48] <charz_> anyway
[07:31:57] <Cork> input accounts for pastes
[07:32:14] <Cork> keyup doesn't
[07:32:28] <charz_> k
[07:33:21] <charz_> ffs why the count wont show up in ('#field9')
[07:33:43] <taplar> oh
[07:33:59] <charz_> my function is ok?
[07:34:01] <taplar> character counter is an input, not a textarea or other object.  you need to use val
[07:34:30] <taplar> text() and html() change what goes between <></>
[07:34:44] <charz_> i use val at line 12
[07:34:47] <charz_> not?
[07:34:51] <taplar> not on line 28
[07:35:16] <charz_> 28?
[07:35:22] <charz_> dont get u
[07:35:42] <taplar> i've tidied it so it may be different, but at the end when your trying to update the characterCounter
[07:35:55] <charz_> im here : https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/10/
[07:36:23] <taplar> *nods* look at the end like i'm saying
[07:37:06] <charz_> can u give me an update pls
[07:37:16] <taplar> ln 23 dude
[07:37:50] <charz_> ah i read 28
[07:37:58] <charz_> https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/11/ that?
[07:38:07] <taplar> yeah, but like i said, i did tidy.  but still, i also said it was the last thing in the script, :|
[07:38:27] <charz_> kk
[07:38:28] <taplar> yup yup
[07:42:01] <taplar> one more thing, your finding id elements based off of another variable
[07:42:05] <taplar> you should just look them up
[07:42:19] <taplar> they can't be duplicated so no need to find them within something
[07:42:23] <charz_> taplar: can i use something else instead of using $this.closest('fieldset'); ? because after my <fieldset> sometimes is more DOM
[07:42:49] <charz_> ah ok
[07:43:00] <taplar> that would also do away with your parent thing
[07:44:33] <charz_> an i point it to field3 on line 8?
[07:44:41] <taplar> actually you don't even need $charactersRemaining.  it's the same as $this
[07:44:58] <charz_> like $this.('#field3');
[07:45:09] <taplar> no, just $('#field3')
[07:45:17] <taplar> but like i said you don't need that.  $this is that
[07:45:28] <charz_> hm
[07:45:34] <charz_> im such a big scrub xD
[07:45:42] <charz_> but i try
[07:46:50] <taplar> and if all your doing with 'this' is changing the value, you don't really have to wrap it.  you could just access this.value for the get and set
[07:48:15] <charz_> hm ok
[07:54:21] <crockstylie> Plop :) my brain is melting because I try to think about a way of saving a list order in mysql after I use jquery ui sortable. Do you have an advice about this ?
[07:54:58] <taplar> about which part?
[07:56:52] <crockstylie> I use mysql, php, pdo, jquery, ajax, jqueryUi, I already have in mysql a "sort" column with an integer incremented on creating a new row, but, there I'm stuck wondering how I could manage the update when I move a row from a place to another.
[07:57:23] <taplar> easiest way would probably be to just renumber them all
[07:57:40] <taplar> instead of having to figure out who you are and how that relates to your siblings
[07:58:27] <crockstylie> wouldn't it be long and heavy when updating in ajax each time I move a row ?
[07:58:39] <taplar> i was just talking about the frontend
[07:58:58] <taplar> updating with ajax each time, depending on number of rows, could be a little excessive
[07:59:40] <charz_> taplar: in my live project i get on line 8 an element is "NULL" ...dafuq?  but there is <fieldsed></fieldset>
[07:59:47] <taplar> otherwise, send to the backend just the one that moved with it's new position and let the backend figure out which ones need updating
[08:00:04] <taplar> i thought you removed the fieldset?  you didn't need the parent logic
[08:00:57] <charz_> no i dont want to change the dom
[08:01:17] <taplar> not the dom, the logic.  you don't need to find the parent to find the other elements.  just lookup the ids
[08:01:43] <charz_> like $('#field9')
[08:01:45] <taplar> yes
[08:01:49] <charz_> k
[08:02:00] <taplar> which your already doing before had around ln 3, so actually you could cache that and reuse it
[08:02:05] <taplar> had= hand
[08:02:29] <taplar> do you understand why that is better?
[08:02:46] <charz_> it saves resources?
[08:03:13] <taplar> $('#someid') essentially translates into document.getElementById('someid') which is one if not the fastest lookup
[08:03:27] <charz_> ye
[08:03:32] <taplar> instead of having to deal with parent elements to try to look in and all that
[08:04:33] <taplar> and ids are unique so you do not have to worry about who they belong to.  they can't belong to multiple things
[09:17:11] <Lucas0231> http://lucas0231.taledar.com/
[10:00:19] <charz_> taplar: could u show me the input version? cuz keyup isnt viable https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/
[10:00:38] <charz_> is it like jQuery('#field3').input(function(){ ?
[10:05:14] <taplar> $().on('input', function(){...
[10:16:01] <merkazu> is there a way to ensure a tracking html fragment gets written and activated before navigating away from the page if the tracking is based on clicks?
[10:16:49] <merkazu> or do i just have to deal with the warning in console about synchronous HTTP being detrimental to user experience?
[10:26:32] <taplar> i forget.  i think you get that warning when you ajax in a source that contains a script import or something
[10:31:24] <charz_> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/3gmdfygd/15/ like that. ok.. but still have problems woth copy and paste
[10:32:35] <taplar> hummm
[10:33:13] <_TWG_> I have 10 checkboxes.  I need to watch when they are checked and unchecked and do something accordingly.  Can anyone help me with how I would watch for those two events.
[10:33:30] <taplar> change event
[10:34:07] <_TWG_> Do I do .is(':checked') or .checked() ?
[10:34:15] <taplar> no, change event
[10:34:23] <taplar> $().on('change', function(){...
[10:34:48] <taplar> or if your asking about inside to test if it is checked or not, you can just use this.checked.  it's a boolean
[10:36:18] <taplar> charz_: your copy and paste check seems to work
[10:36:31] <taplar> it keeps me from going above 800
[10:37:55] <rand0m> hello all :)
[10:38:02] <rand0m> im struggling with a small logic
[10:38:06] <rand0m> could anyone please help me out ?
[10:39:49] <taplar> just ask man
[10:40:07] <rand0m> here is a fiddle i created
[10:40:08] <rand0m> https://jsfiddle.net/985xpsvz/1/
[10:40:22] <rand0m> what im trying to do is to create slides based on the data I have
[10:40:53] <rand0m> each slide containing 3 items with similar dom structure
[10:41:13] <taplar> have you considered using any of the already existing slider plugins out there?
[10:41:37] <rand0m> uhh, yeah
[10:41:42] <rand0m> I am using caroufredslider
[10:41:46] <rand0m> but
[10:42:00] <_TWG_> taplar: I guess I'm doing something wrong.  Can you look at this, http://kopy.io/VzIMO
[10:42:02] <rand0m> I'm failing to create the content that goes into each slider
[10:42:34] <taplar> _TWG_: don't wrap this.  just 'this.checked'
[10:42:47] <taplar> it's an Element property
[10:43:01] <taplar> same you can just console log this.value
[10:43:10] <_TWG_> awesome.  that works.  Thank you
[10:43:14] <rand0m> if you can see in my fiddle, i have created a dom structure which I am aiming to create using jquery
[10:43:29] <rand0m> but for some reason im lost
[10:44:07] <taplar> rand0m: you should consider using fragments instead of appending the text
[10:44:25] <rand0m> idk, can you elaborate
[10:44:54] <taplar> you create your element such as var $newLi = $('<li>');
[10:44:58] <taplar> and then you append whatever to it
[10:45:01] <rand0m> ah
[10:45:04] <rand0m> I understand
[10:45:05] <taplar> and at the end you append it to the page
[10:45:22] <rand0m> i am planning to do that later
[10:45:28] <rand0m> once I get this logic fixed
[10:46:12] <rand0m> on line 66  I need all items after a += "<div class='secondary'>";  to be wrapped in a += "<div class='secondary mediaItem'>";
[10:46:16] <rand0m> this is where im srtuck
[10:46:19] <rand0m> stuck*
[10:46:29] <taplar> your logic seems weird though, the way your doing the modulus
[10:47:09] <rand0m> oh crap
[10:47:13] <rand0m> I just noticed
[10:47:15] <rand0m> you are right
[10:47:23] <taplar> your losing data, :)
[10:47:28] <rand0m> :'(
[10:48:38] <rand0m> oh wait
[10:49:10] <taplar> max is showing lisa's data
[10:49:14] <taplar> and lisa's name is not there
[10:51:06] <taplar> you also have your ul commented out so your logic isn't actually showing in the page, awkwardCough just pointed out to me
[10:55:34] <_TWG_> taplar have you worked with Google Maps API much?
[10:55:42] <taplar> not at all
[10:55:47] <_TWG_> okay
[10:57:27] <rand0m> i've updated my codebase
[10:57:27] <rand0m> https://jsfiddle.net/985xpsvz/3/
[10:57:36] <rand0m> i've made a mistake when I was creating it
[10:58:26] <rand0m> hey taplar
[10:58:33] <rand0m> if you see my output
[10:58:51] <rand0m> you'll see that theres empty space between lisa, alex and greg
[10:59:17] <rand0m> infact it should be filled by dan, angelica and natasha
[10:59:48] <rand0m> so it would look like lisa, dan, alex, angelica, greg, natasha
[11:03:35] <rand0m> yes! I think i figured it out
[11:05:49] <KnightsOfNi> Guys, is it conventional to add parameter values as attributes to a html elemnet? I need to make ajax requests and provide a number of parameters, but I don't know where to retrieve them, unless doing data-username="xx" and getting it like that.., but that way people can just alter it and then perform the request
[11:05:55] <KnightsOfNi> how is this done?
[11:06:36] <rand0m> it is KnightsOfNi, only if the data is safe (secure i.e. non sensitive)
[11:06:53] <KnightsOfNi> what would be sensitive?
[11:08:14] <KnightsOfNi> for example, what if I need to do an ajax request and pass in a user_id, for example to update a user's profile
[11:08:21] <KnightsOfNi> would that user_id be sensitive info?
[11:08:46] <rand0m> maybe, maybe not
[11:08:56] <rand0m> depends on your architecture
[11:09:05] <rand0m> usually its not
[11:09:20] <placidb> I have an object element that loads an .svg vector. I need to do some calculating on its width, so I set up a .load() handler for it, only in Chrome, in about 1 out of 10 times, the .width() and .height() of the element report the default (?) dimensions of 300x150, rather than the actual size.
[11:09:28] <placidb> firefox seems unaffected
[11:09:37] <placidb> am I missing something, or have I encountered a bug?
[11:09:49] <taplar> rand0m: give this a gander: https://jsfiddle.net/985xpsvz/4/
[11:10:40] <KnightsOfNi> but placidb, what if you do this and a user alters data-userid="1" with google dev tools and then performs a certain action that retrieves that id?
[11:11:01] <taplar> $(elementSelector).data('userid')
[11:11:29] <KnightsOfNi> but some malicious user edited the html and changed it to data-userid="3"
[11:11:37] <taplar> can't stop that
[11:11:43] <KnightsOfNi> and then the ajax call will send the wrong id
[11:11:50] <taplar> you have to do validation on your backend.  but you should always do that regardless
[11:12:08] <placidb> KnightsOfNi: I'm sorry, I don't understand. you seem to be adressing another question?
[11:12:13] <KnightsOfNi> yes I do, but it still shouldn't be possible for someone to send ajax requests like this, right?
[11:12:21] <taplar> again, you can't stop that
[11:12:33] <placidb> addressing *
[11:12:35] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[11:13:02] <KnightsOfNi> so you can just attach the userid to the body element?
[11:13:22] <taplar> you could do that
[11:13:29] <KnightsOfNi> <body data-userid="1">
[11:13:33] <taplar> sure
[11:17:28] <_TWG_> if I want to read the data from JSON into a variable, what type would I use to declare the variable globally to be used?
[11:17:40] <rand0m> taplar:
[11:17:44] <rand0m> https://jsfiddle.net/985xpsvz/6/ <-- solution
[11:17:48] <rand0m> thats what I wanted
[11:17:48] <taplar> you'd just scope so it's more global
[11:18:14] <taplar> rand0m: lot of redundancy there
[11:18:20] <rand0m> how
[11:18:33] <_TWG_> taplar: was that first comment to me?
[11:18:38] <taplar> lol, you can't see the redundancy?
[11:18:40] <rand0m> mind you, i've changed the contents of the data
[11:18:57] <taplar> _TWG_: the scope comment was
[11:19:40] <_TWG_> taplar: okay, thanks
[11:19:44] <rand0m> all I needed was a grid like that
[11:19:54] <taplar> ok, congrats then
[11:19:58] <rand0m> 1 div <=> 2 divs
[11:20:01] <rand0m> me?
[11:20:04] <taplar> yup
[11:20:25] <rand0m> thanks, but im still trying to normalize the code
[11:20:49] <rand0m> the logic i've used is mind boggling
[11:21:04] <rand0m> not sure if i should use something like  if (((2 * i) + 2) % 3 == 0) { in my code
[11:21:17] <rand0m> heck it works fine, but is there a better way
[11:22:44] <taplar> *shrug* start mapping it out, figure out the common pieces and the things that differ for each iteration, and generalize the common stuff
[11:24:09] <rand0m> alright mqn
[11:24:11] <rand0m> man
[11:24:18] <rand0m> thanks for your help
[11:24:20] <rand0m> adios
[11:24:25] * rand0m flies away
[11:47:56] <Ungy> how would I get all "th" elements in a row except ones that have a sepcific class?
[11:48:27] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/not/
[11:48:34] <taplar> $('th').not('class') or $('th:not(class)')
[11:48:46] <Ungy> thank you
[11:49:43] <nexace_> how do you include jquery-ui in jsfiddle?
[11:50:02] <taplar> depending on the version jsfiddle already has it as a selectable
[11:50:12] <taplar> otherwise you can use the external resources link on the lhs
[11:50:17] <nexace_> thats what I'm asking, how do you select it
[11:50:19] <nexace_> must you be logged in?
[11:50:26] <taplar> no, just have the right version chosen
[11:50:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> select jquery 2.1.4
[11:50:36] <taplar> i think 1.9 has it maybe
[11:50:40] <robertmaxrees> you'll see a checkbox for it.
[11:51:04] <nexace_> when I click "External Resources" all I get is "Javascript/CSS URI"
[11:51:12] <robertmaxrees> right, don't click that.
[11:51:18] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon in the javascript pane.
[11:51:32] <nexace_> robertmaxrees: haha, thanks.
[11:51:38] <robertmaxrees> select jquery 2.1.4 under the "frameworks & extensions" dropdown, etc :)
[11:54:44] <nexace_> I have a sliding div which collapses onclick. I'm wonderning how I can make it only slide/collapse if a link within the div is not selected on the click. https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/1/
[11:56:48] <taplar> i take it on the real page the clicking of the links are not navigating away from the page?
[11:58:44] <Hollusionist> nexace_: how do you "select" a link?
[12:00:29] <nexace_> Hollusionist: what I mean, is as it stands now if a user clicks a link in the div, the div collapses/expands and opens the link. I dont want that to happen
[12:00:39] <nexace_> if a link is clicked, the user is not trying to expand/collapse the div
[12:01:08] <nexace_> taplar: that is correct. clicking link simply changes target irframe
[12:01:10] <nexace_> iframe
[12:01:34] <robertmaxrees> target all child links of the container and stopPropagation
[12:01:41] <taplar> ^ beat me to it
[12:02:38] <nexace_> any possibility you could demonstrate with the jsfiddle? https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/1/
[12:03:44] <Hollusionist> nexace_: within the click function you can check whether the user clicked on link or not
[12:03:58] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/2/
[12:04:40] <nexace_> taplar: thanks man
[12:06:48] <taplar> or what Hollusionist was saying: https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/3/
[12:07:32] <Hollusionist> nexace_: https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/4/
[12:07:40] <Hollusionist> oh taplar beat me to it :P
[12:07:48] <nexace_> wow thanks a lot all
[12:15:35] <awkwardCough> stole awkwardCough's pc: https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/5/
[12:16:31] <taplar> dang, you can glitch that one by clicking fast, :(
[12:24:35] <awkwardCough> boom shaka laka laka https://jsfiddle.net/yae0ks5v/7/
[12:25:53] <decx> best practise is to only animate transform and opacity
[12:26:40] <taplar> what's the down side?
[12:27:27] <decx> no idea
[12:27:41] <decx> maybe animating a matrix is better accelerated
[12:28:25] <taplar> ah, i was wondering if it was a compatibility concern
[12:30:00] <taplar> oh well, i had my fun, :)
[12:30:32] <decx> oh right transform and opacity only do a composite
[12:30:41] <decx> no paint, layout and shit
[12:31:14] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/RITXEGO.jpg
[12:31:45] <taplar> ah
[12:32:14] <decx> like changing left on an element that isnt absolute will redraw all the things below it
[12:36:46] <physikoi> Good day, #jquery. I have what I think is a simple question. How does one determine when bits of jquery/js can be executed before DOM ready and what needs to wait until after the DOM is ready?
[12:39:02] <BillCriswell> If the element shows up before the script tag you're trying to access it in, you should be all right. Though, not really worth the hassle.
[12:42:22] <physikoi> BillCriswell: Hm ok, so any code meant to alter elements (pretty much most of it) should be loaded after the DOM is ready? I suppose auxiliary functions -- functions called by self-invoking functions -- don't need to wait for DOM to be ready?
[12:44:02] <taplar> it would depend if those methods are doing lookups or if they are provided with their elements
[12:45:25] <Ungy> physikoi, if your code is trying to modify elements in the dom you have to wait until the dom itself has those elements
[12:45:42] <physikoi> taplar: that makes sense.
[12:46:38] <physikoi> Ungy: I think I'm clear on that. Makes perfect sense. $(document).ready() doesn't wait for CSS to render, right?
[12:46:46] <taplar> typically you put the logic at the bottom so you don't have to worry about it, and also to avoid the potential ie issue
[12:47:54] <Ungy> physikoi: I am not sure I think that might depend on the rendering engine
[12:48:10] <BillCriswell>  Should only wait for the DOM to be ready if you need to do anything with it.
[12:48:30] <physikoi> taplar: yeah, i've been told that as a rule of thumb. Ive also read that certain libraries, like Modernizr, should be loaded in the head.
[12:48:39] <physikoi> Ungy: k, thanks
[12:48:48] <taplar> weird
[12:49:21] <physikoi> BillCriswell: otherwise I am wasting time.
[12:49:58] <physikoi> Come to thikn of it, I think I've underestimated the importance of loading post DOM or from bottom of document WRT preventing FOUC
[12:50:10] <Ungy> Doesn't Modernizr rewite some functionality to support features in a browser that are not native? If so that woudl make sense to load it before the DOM is completed
[12:50:34] <taplar> ah
[12:50:43] <taplar> 'FOUC' ?
[12:51:08] <physikoi> Ungy: that is my understanding, though i've stayed away from customizing it cause I'm not quite comfortable enough with it. Which is unfortunate because it would lighten the load
[12:51:19] <physikoi> taplar: flash of unstylized content
[12:51:22] <Ungy> tablar flash of unstyled content
[12:51:35] <taplar> ah
[12:51:44] <physikoi> it's a bad thinkg haha
[12:51:47] <physikoi> thing*
[12:52:11] <taplar> so thats like having an element on the page that the logic hides, but it initially is visible
[12:52:23] <Ungy> physikoi not necessarily depends on your purpose.
[12:53:02] <physikoi> Ungy: arg, another rule of thumb, is it?
[12:53:04] <Ungy> taplar or you have a orderlist you have styled as a horizontal menu and it appears as bullet points then css is applied
[12:53:41] <taplar> hmm, css should be applied when it is drawn, so not sure how that would happen
[12:53:55] <Ungy> physikoi: everything usually depends on what your trying to do with it
[12:54:12] <Ungy> taplar dynamically loaded css
[12:54:25] * taplar does a cross with his fingers
[12:54:27] <Ungy> taplar although 6 years ago browers often did that
[12:55:54] <Ungy> taplar you can also get corrupted css it happens a lot I get clients complaingin that a site isn;t displaying right and the css download got corrupted. My favorite is when they complain abotu sites that I don;t even work on like I control their browsers
[12:57:12] <taplar> i'll have to take your word for it, :)
[12:57:17] <physikoi> OK, I think I've got enough understanding to progress a bit further. Thanks everyone for your assistance. Glad to find a channel that's well populated.
[12:57:39] <physikoi> And knowledgeable :)
[12:59:23] <taplar> well, populated is questionable.  swear most of them are bots
[12:59:28] <Uhkis> physikoi: just never visit during weekends so that dream doesnt shatter
[12:59:29] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[12:59:33] <BillCriswell> I'm only you all.
[12:59:35] <BillCriswell> onto*
[13:00:28] <taplar> it's fun to occasionally search google for "jQuery, <chat name>" and see some sites that apparently have stored scraped conversations
[13:01:08] <taplar> though that's more rampant with s.o.
[13:04:09] <CSWookie> Is there a function that jqxGrid calls before it changes the DOM (whether it be for sorting, filtering grouping, whatever)?  I'd like to know when the grid's about to move my cheese, and when it's done moving said cheese.
[13:09:01] <taplar> not sure, check out the available events it throws: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxgrid/#demos/jqxgrid/filtering.htm
[13:16:55] <hi-liter99> howdy!
[13:17:04] <taplar> bon jour
[13:29:00] <CSWookie> taplar: Nope, all the events are for when it's done doing stuff, it looks like...  Maybe one day I'll look into fixing that problem, and submit a pull request... Meanwhile I'll make do just knowing about data.
[14:11:16] <hi-liter99> trying to have dynamic divs stackup one on top of each other like a deck of cards, not sure how to accomplish that... I have the following code thus far --> https://jsfiddle.net/gbaarz4m/
[14:16:19] <Uhkis> hi-liter99: https://jsfiddle.net/gbaarz4m/1/
[14:18:02] <hi-liter99> Uhkis: i forgot to mention with a slight variation in right position with every div added... like 10px or so....
[14:20:20] <hi-liter99> Uhkis: kinda like --> http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/72/8b/26/728b26d2019638469d4d7a623ed88003.jpg
[14:23:28] <Ungy> hi-liter99, you mean like putting the absolut positioning of the next object down by like 3px and left by like three pixels and incereasing the z-index by one on every click?
[14:25:15] <hi-liter99> Ungy: yes exactly... working on it but not what i want...
[14:25:54] <Ungy> OK well what do yo want
[14:26:35] <hi-liter99> sorry, I am working on it, but not working right... =(
[14:28:42] <hi-liter99> Ungy: you ever done something like the image above?
[14:31:49] <Ungy> stacking things yes
[14:36:18] <hi-liter99> Ungy: this is what I have so far --> https://jsfiddle.net/gbaarz4m/3/
[14:37:30] <Ungy> hi-liter99, https://jsfiddle.net/gbaarz4m/4/ I think you might need to increase the parents dive size and make sure it displays all but
[14:38:53] <hi-liter99> Ungy: yours seems to work, but only with one click...
[14:39:37] <Ungy> hi-liter99, https://jsfiddle.net/gbaarz4m/5/ there you go
[14:39:52] <Ungy> change the sizes as you want
[14:40:15] <hi-liter99> lol, awesome
[14:40:17] <hi-liter99> thanks
[14:42:37] <hi-liter99> Ungy: you method way simpler, than the shite I was working on...
[14:44:49] <Ungy> hi-liter99, well it works
[14:45:11] <Ungy> what you trying to do anyway?
[14:45:16] <hi-liter99> yup!

[15:39:22] <_TWG_> ]

[16:04:13] <titii> Good evening
[16:07:32] <titii> Can u say my what its the problem? Any ideas? I have cloning some elements into another one (container) but when I go back to the first block and change some checkboxes, and again sumaring cloning, the same process as in the begining, i have the same previous result, it is cached or what?
[16:09:18] <titii> Other words, I have some checkboxes in one container... then i want to clone it into another one, to see the result, but i have still cloning the same content, when I change the checking of boxes, I have still the same result like in first time
[16:09:20] <titii> Why?
[16:16:45] * bellulah is away: I'm busy
[16:16:57] * bellulah is back (gone 00:00:04)
[16:34:54] <xnoxk> why im having that error on my console, I guess somehting is wrong with my ajax call? https://dpaste.de/rtHn
[16:39:00] <thinkxl> xnoxk line 24 should have `.val()` too?
[16:39:11] <thinkxl> `$('input[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]').val()` ?
[16:39:28] <thinkxl> what is the response you are getting from the ajax request?
[16:42:23] <xnoxk> thinkxl: oh okay
[16:42:24] <xnoxk> it solves the recursively issue but I have another template that should appear if the form has error, and how it is right now even if the form has errors it doesnt load the view/template displaying which are the errors
[16:43:33] <thinkxl> well, how do you want to show the errors? redirecting the browser to another page
[16:43:43] <thinkxl> or getting the errors through the ajax call?
[16:44:17] <thinkxl> if the first, your code doesn't have a redirect function, if the second, your code doesn't have an error callback
[16:44:45] <xnoxk> thinkxl: im loading it through backend which is django, take a look at https://dpaste.de/MKrm#L19
[16:44:55] <xnoxk> thinkxl: which option fits better on my case?
[16:45:01] <xnoxk> I don't want to redirect though
[16:46:26] <thinkxl> well, then you need to gather the dada from what you return in your python backend
[16:46:40] <thinkxl> and implement accordingly in your callback functions
[16:47:18] <thinkxl> in the line 14 of your python you are returning a redirect
[16:47:42] <xnoxk> thinkxl: I will change it to a render as well
[16:47:51] <thinkxl> what you are doing in your back-end differs on what you are trying to do on the front-end
[16:48:19] <xnoxk> but that redirect is when the form is submitted successfully
[16:48:24] <xnoxk> not when has errors
[16:48:46] <thinkxl> but you are doing an ajax call
[16:49:02] <thinkxl> well, nevermind
[16:49:33] <thinkxl> I think you need to read through https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[17:19:32] <xnoxk> thinkxl: are u around
[17:25:27] <hi-liter99> does jquery have a drag function that is not part of the jQuery UI ??
[17:25:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:27:10] <hi-liter99> using draggable "JqueryUI"  but need draggable functionalyon two different elements totally un-related to each other...
[17:27:20] <karabaja4> hi-liter99: you can do something like this, it's not hard - https://jsfiddle.net/tovic/Xcb8d/
[17:28:25] <hi-liter99> karabaja4: yeah was looking at that...
[17:41:54] <skinux> Are there any good plugins that give jQuery a Virtual DOM?
[17:43:24] <hi-liter99> karabaja4:  how can I make it work with a class not an ID --> https://jsfiddle.net/Xcb8d/1340/
[17:44:58] <robertmaxrees> skinux not really?
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> hi-liter99 that code isn't doing anything with an ID.
[17:48:02] <robertmaxrees> also: you're not really using jquery there.
[17:48:16] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementByClassName is your issue, either way.
[17:48:42] <hi-liter99> robertmaxrees: what is wrong with "document.getElementByClassName'?
[17:48:49] <robertmaxrees> it's not a function.
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> there's a document.getElementsByClassName, but then you have to enumerate through the result set.
[17:49:20] <hi-liter99> oh what is the proper function for class not ID?
[17:49:24] <karabaja4> getElementByClassName -> getElementsByClassName[0]
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> just use jquery though.
[17:49:37] <karabaja4> you're missing a "s" there
[17:49:39] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClassName')
[17:49:41] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[17:50:03] <hi-liter99> robertmaxrees: oh right on
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> you ARE in #jquery after all ;)
[17:50:35] <karabaja4> are there any non-jquery javascript channels on freenode?
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript
[17:51:22] <hi-liter99> karabaja4: using jquery,  just wanted to see what other options there was
[17:52:07] <karabaja4> robertmaxrees: nice thanks. now i see there's actually a #typescript channel too :)
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:54:35] <huck5> I'm trying to use `$(':focus');` to get the focused element on my webpage. I'm doing this in my web-debugger console. I get back an empty array. Is this because focus on an element is lost when I click on the web-inspector window?
[17:57:28] <robertmaxrees> huck5 easy enough to test - do something like $(document).on('focusout', function() { console.log('test'); });
[17:57:41] <robertmaxrees> huck5 then try using the console and see if it fires
[17:57:52] <huck5> robertmaxrees, ah, an excellent idea! Thank you :)
[17:58:29] <huck5> Yep, that was why!
[18:02:17] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[18:10:03] <xnoxk> i submit the form with errors but in the console.log appears the success function, it needs to do the if statement of the backend where it sees if the obj.choice match the _solution -> https://dpaste.de/oDOP
[18:12:43] <hi-liter99> robertmaxrees: used $('.foo').draggable(); worked perfectly
[18:12:49] <robertmaxrees> hi-liter99 cool.
[19:31:37] <domino14> what does it mean if i have a $('select').val() === null ?
[19:31:46] <domino14> what's a null value? does that mean nothing was selected, or something else?
[19:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not possible.
[19:32:25] <robertmaxrees> you'd either get undefined or '' (empty string)(
[19:32:32] <domino14> well, i got a null :P
[19:32:37] <robertmaxrees> how?
[19:32:38] <domino14> that's what i thought too
[19:32:45] <domino14> it's making stuff break
[19:32:46] <domino14> let's see
[19:34:18] <domino14> When the first element in the collection is a select-multiple (i.e., a select element with the multiple attribute set), it returns an array containing the value of each selected option, or null if no options are selected.
[19:34:24] <domino14> but this isn't a select-multiple
[19:34:34] <domino14> is there any other reason .val() would return null?
[19:34:37] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[19:36:23] <domino14> https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13097
[19:36:32] <domino14> maybe it thinks it's disabled
[19:36:37] <robertmaxrees> well then there we go.
[19:36:51] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:36:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[19:37:00] <robertmaxrees> okay, i'll build the fiddle.
[19:38:18] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  i wonder if this really is intentional.
[19:38:49] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/val/#val
[19:38:59] <robertmaxrees> "When the first element in the collection is a select-multiple (i.e., a select element with the multiple attribute set), it returns an array containing the value of each selected option, or null if no options are selected. When called on an empty collection, it returns undefined."
[19:39:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:47:49] <domino14> it's not disabled, and its not a select multiple
[19:47:52] <domino14> yet i still get a null
[19:48:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:48:41] <robertmaxrees> read what i just quoted.
[19:48:58] <robertmaxrees> "When the first element in the collection is a select-multiple [...]  it returns an array containing the value of each selected option, or null if no options are selected."
[19:49:16] <domino14> but the first element of my collection is not a select-multiple
[19:49:26] <robertmaxrees> then what is it?
[19:49:30] <domino14> it's just a regular select
[19:49:43] <robertmaxrees> does it have the multiple attribute?
[19:50:14] <domino14> it doesnt
[19:50:27] <robertmaxrees> lol this is why i asked for a fiddle earlier.
[19:50:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:51:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/710gegey/
[19:51:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what you're doing to get null.
[19:51:16] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle to make it clearer maybe?
[19:56:12] <domino14> oh it is disabled
[19:56:14] <domino14> sigh
[19:56:29] <domino14> it deosn't show when i log it, but when i use debugger, it does

[21:06:52] <Kazuto> So I'm working on my website, which contains jQuery. I have PHP pull some data from a website and build a series of "blocks" using Bootstrap. My problem here is that I've created three dropdowns that should define the scope of the page (eg. clicking the letter "A" shows all blocks starting with A), but when I click on them, they aren't properly set as
[21:06:52] <Kazuto> active. Here's my fiddle with the JS: https://jsfiddle.net/o0spm087/1/ Can anyone find the reason as to why this occurs?
[21:10:45] <aleksa> Hello. If I have many <select> tags in html and I want to get the ID of the one whose changed, how do I achieve that?
[21:11:12] <aleksa> I'm trying http://jsfiddle.net/YB8UW/719/
[21:11:51] <aleksa> I can only get the value of selected item: var value = $(this).children(":selected").attr("value");
[21:12:09] <aleksa> how do I get an ID of the select tag?
[21:12:54] <Kazuto> aleksa: StackOverflow states to get an ID of an element, you'd do $('your-element-here').attr('id');
[21:13:39] <aleksa> Kazuto, by an element, do you mean the item?
[21:14:31] <aleksa> it works now
[21:14:44] <aleksa> it didn't work when I typed attr("id")
[21:14:51] <aleksa> but works with 'id'
[21:14:56] <aleksa> "" vs ''
[21:14:58] <aleksa> ?
[21:15:27] <Kazuto> aleksa: JavaScript is odd with strings. I'm not well versed in it, so I'm looking it up at the moment :P
[21:15:43] <aleksa> Kazuto, thank you :D
[21:16:10] <Kazuto> aleksa: Not a problem, glad you figured it out. Basically, if you're in doubt, single quote it out. :)
[21:16:27] <Kazuto> s/ figured it out/r problem was solved/
[21:16:27] <b-ot> Correction, <Kazuto> aleksa: Not a problem, glad your problem was solved. Basically, if you're in doubt, single quote it out. :)
[21:18:14] <aleksa> s/ thank you/r thank you. I didn't know this bot works.
[21:18:14] <b-ot> Correction, <aleksa> Kazuto,r thank you. I didn't know this bot works. :D
[21:20:04] <Kazuto> aleksa: Didn't even know it was here ;) I just normally do that over the normal IM correction of using asterisks.
[22:46:36] <Kazuto> So I'm trying to use the class regex selector, but jQuery tells me it's unrecognised: $('class^=blah-blah') What's the issue with this? I tried surrounding "blah-blah" in quotes, but it doesn't work either
[22:47:36] <systemfault> Because that's not how you select by attributes
[22:47:47] <systemfault> [class^="blah-blah"]
[22:47:55] <systemfault> You should consider learning CSS.
[22:48:29] <Kazuto> systemfault: I'm not that well versed in jQuery and JavaScript. Apologies, I'm more of a Java/C# person
[22:48:39] <systemfault> I understand
[22:48:45] <Kazuto> Thanks though, I'll try that
[22:52:54] <Kazuto> systemfault: Now one more question, how would I get elements if I know the beginning and end?
[22:53:10] <systemfault> What do you mean?
[22:53:40] <Kazuto> systemfault: Say I have three classes, "just-one-class", "just-two-class", "just-three-class" How do I match them all?
[22:53:59] <systemfault> You want a "or" or a "and"?
[22:54:31] <Kazuto> systemfault: And
[22:54:31] <systemfault> You want all elements matching one of those three? Or all the elements matching the three classes?
[22:54:50] <systemfault> just-one-class.just-two-class.just-three-class
[22:55:00] <systemfault> Err I meant, .just-one-class.just-two-class.just-three-class
[22:55:13] <systemfault> That would find all the nodes having those three classes
[22:55:43] <Kazuto> Mm, apologies, I think I explained it wrong. Just like how we matched all elements containing a class starting with `blah-blah`, I want to match all elements containing a class that starts with `just-` and ending with `-class`
[22:55:50] <Kazuto> So each element will have one of the three
[22:56:14] <Kazuto> I might want to sleep after this, haha, can't really think straight
[22:57:32] <Kazuto> systemfault: If you didn't look since before, ^
[22:57:33] <systemfault> Ah, then: .just-one-class, .just-two-class, .just-three-class
[22:57:54] <systemfault> Ah
[22:57:56] <Kazuto> systemfault: That's the thing, I don't know what the middle will be
[22:58:25] <systemfault> You can't really rely on order... because your node's classes could be changed via JS.
[22:58:34] <Kazuto> In normal regex I'd do ^just-(.*)-class$
[22:58:37] <systemfault> Not sure how I would do that.
[22:58:58] <Kazuto> All of the nodes I'm working with only have the one class
[22:59:54] <Kazuto> So I can grab them all with either $("[class^=just-]") or $("[class$=-class]"), but there are a few other elements that are not in the intersection between them
[23:00:22] <systemfault> You can have class="foo bar baz"
[23:00:54] <systemfault> Can't you add a common class to all the nodes you need?
[23:01:13] <systemfault> Just prefix the classname with js- to be sure it won't clash with anything.
[23:01:59] <Kazuto> systemfault: Mm, that sounds easy enough. Going to implement that first thing tomorrow, cheers friend :)
[23:02:17] <systemfault> Yeah, because what you tried so far are pretty much "hacks"
