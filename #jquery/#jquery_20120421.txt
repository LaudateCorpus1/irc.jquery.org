[00:00:05] <shoky> :) thnx
[00:09:28] <snookinhersnizz> Whirl3d: right, but you mentioned that there was a plugin (presumably for jq) that does it.  You seemed to be infering from this that there might be a service from Google or Alexa based on the fact that there's a plugin that doesthe job. Are you not familiar with any sufch plugin?
[00:10:47] <Whirl3d> No. that was my point that I kept trying to make. I have seen other sites do thumbnails for search results, and even evernote does thumbnails somehow, so it can be done. I figured it would be worth checking out, but I don't know of anything in particular.
[00:12:01] <Whirl3d> I know that google chaches a shit-ton of thumbs and they would be likely to offer to license them out or something...but I don't have any firsthand experience with it. I would look to the developers of plugins like fasterFox and see how they do it
[00:13:34] <Whirl3d> There might even be a php plugin that loads the content into an iframe and then snags a screencaputre from the iframe and returns it to a directory on your server that you could then display
[00:13:39] <vl1234> hi hi gud after noon
[00:14:05] <Whirl3d> 3 am here in Atlanta, GA. Gud afternoon
[00:15:56] <vl1234> http://jsfiddle.net/QutDL/  see this example i need to if value s empty means to display null
[00:16:20] <vl1234> am tried........but still showing undifined
[00:16:23] <vl1234> only
[00:16:36] <vl1234> how to eliminate
[00:16:39] <vl1234> that one
[00:17:40] <Whirl3d> $.data() is a jquery method that creates an object associated with an element in which you can store information.
[00:18:37] <abjorn> WORKIN HARD TO GET MY FILL
[00:18:40] <Whirl3d> It is not part of the dom* so you won't be able to access it by calling $("div").data("test1").... there's no "data" object made for test1
[00:18:41] <abjorn> EVERYBODY WA NTS  ATRHIIIL
[00:18:48] <abjorn> PAYIN ANY TO ROOL THE DIIICE
[00:18:49] <vl1234> http://jsfiddle.net/QutDL/1/
[00:18:51] <abjorn> JUST OONE MORE TIIME
[00:19:07] <NodeX> $("span:eq(0)").text("" + ($("div").data("test1")=='undefined') ? '' : $("div").data("test1") );
[00:19:29] <Whirl3d> So, you could add data to the divs like this: $("div").data("someProperty","someValue");
[00:19:53] <Whirl3d> and then access that data with $("div").data("someProperty").....would give you "someValue"
[00:20:46] <vl1234> @whirl3d.......k ill try and get back to u
[00:21:01] <Whirl3d> So where is your data coming from?
[00:21:17] <vl1234> @whirl3d.......its json
[00:21:40] <Whirl3d> sure, but do you have it stored in an object literal?
[00:23:20] <vl1234> ya like that only am din
[00:27:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/QutDL/4/
[00:28:47] <Whirl3d> In this example, I took an arbitrary object called myParsedJSON and put each attribute of that object in one of the div's data object. Then I assigned a click handler that would copy the clicked elements' data "message" into it's blank span
[00:28:57] <Whirl3d> Click on each div to see it work.
[00:33:43] <Whirl3d> Well, gnite folks.
[00:47:47] <xenaxon> how can I trigger something when a select is changed?
[00:51:14] <astkfour> If anyone is interested? I need to hire someone for a little work? I will pay you paypal for your time. Need a jquery and canvas script.
[00:53:09] <wodemaye_> http://api.jquery.com/bind/#comment-91995524 xenaxon is that what you're looking for?
[00:55:13] <wodemaye_> xenaxon i hate to ask you this, but do you have the log for this channel going back a few hours? my computer crashed, and i lost all my copies.  anyone else who doesn't mind doing this, i would really appreciate it.  i was on earlier via qwebirc as snookinhersnizz
[01:02:54] <wodemaye_> xenaxon, did you find what you needed?
[01:07:14] <raj> how can I make text scroll back and for if it's too large for the element it's in?
[01:07:20] <raj> i mean, too long
[01:07:25] <xenaxon> wodemaye_: I did
[01:07:27] <raj> *back and forth
[01:07:31] <xenaxon> .change event
[01:07:35] <xenaxon> was what I wanted
[01:07:42] <xenaxon> but i can't figure out how to make it work
[01:07:48] <xenaxon> on my site
[01:08:01] <xenaxon> can I have jquery dom ready function anywhere in a file?
[01:08:16] <wodemaye_> i wanna say that you can.
[01:08:19] <wodemaye_> but i'm no expert.
[01:08:36] <wodemaye_> xenaxon, do you have the logs from the past few hours though? or you, raj?
[01:09:24] <wodemaye_> raj, what kind of element?
[01:09:50] <wodemaye_> theres a great iframe autoresize plugin that you may want to look into.  you  may be able to hack it to suit your needs.
[01:12:22] <raj> wodemaye_, any kind of element
[01:12:30] <raj> what do you want from the logs?
[01:12:57] <wodemaye_> raj because my computer crashed. and i asked a question but i lost my screen buffer.
[01:13:18] <raj> what was the question?
[01:13:22] <wodemaye_> so i never got to see if there was an answer.
[01:13:27] <tw2113> wodemaye_ http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120420.log.html
[01:13:55] <wodemaye_> tw2113, oh. duh.  sorry for such a damn stupid question.
[01:14:09] <wodemaye_> i guess i got it confused with other channels that don't allow public logging.
[01:14:17] <tw2113> ?
[01:14:32] <wodemaye_> xenaxon, like i said you may be able to hack auto iframe resize to meet your needs.
[01:15:35] <raj> why does this page clear out after a few seconds?
[01:15:35] <raj> http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html
[01:16:30] <tw2113> no idea
[01:18:31] <tw2113> i wonder if this plays a part in it raj
[01:18:33] <tw2113> http://rem.io/hot-link.js
[01:18:47] <tw2113> which is a file i got to by viewing the source-code
[01:20:35] <scandic> Hi all
[01:20:43] <goddard> how do I do pop ups like facebook?
[01:22:24] <raj> goddard, what kind of popup?
[01:22:51] <raj> tw2113, anyway, any suggestion on how to do this marquee text?
[01:23:19] <tw2113> personally, i'd rather not see marquee text
[01:23:36] <raj> it's important in this case
[01:23:49] <raj> for an element that can't fit all the text
[01:24:15] <tw2113> http://blogfreakz.com/jquery/marquee-style-scrolling-marquee-jquery-plugin/
[01:25:24] <raj> ok, so marquee().
[01:25:37] <raj> tw2113, how would I make it go back the other way when it reaches the end of the text?
[01:25:41] <tw2113> assuming that's a built in function and not a plugn
[01:25:43] <tw2113> plugin*
[01:25:43] <raj> so it just scrolls back and forth
[01:25:58] <tw2113> i dunno, i'm duckduckgo searching and pasting you links
[01:26:14] <raj> oh, ddg man, are you?
[01:26:46] <tw2113> yup
[01:27:52] <raj> this one requires text to be in an ul or ol
[01:28:01] <raj> weak
[01:28:02] <raj> :)
[01:28:23] <tw2113> *shrug*
[01:28:27] <scandic> Someone here who would like to help a noob who has no plan about javascript and DOM at all but needs to get something done for his php based site?^^
[01:28:38] <tw2113> like i said, i was just searching and pasting what i thought would maybe help
[01:29:05] <raj> yeah, i have'nt had much luck searching either, honestly
[01:29:50] <raj> scandic, what's your question
[01:31:31] <scandic> raj: I'm developing a statictics site for Ikariam (Browsergame). With the current production version all is fine but they put a new one to the testing server which is fully ajaxed and I don't find a way to check for injected content to run my own functions in greasemonkey
[01:31:59] <raj> no idea what you're talking about
[01:32:14] <scandic> I thought soâ€¦
[01:34:39] <scandic> I'll try to make it clear. A greasemonkey script needs to check if the DOM has been modified, find the defined elements and do something. I've played around with dom events already but had no luck at all
[01:54:35] <youngin> Evixion: hey
[01:54:53] <youngin> Evixion: disregard that please
[01:55:19] <youngin> Eviltwin: pm
[01:55:35] <RA3OR> http://pastesite.com/34751 can anyone help ?
[01:56:02] <RA3OR> or how dow i slideDown(400); a hidden div from a <select option ?
[01:56:39] <minna> How can i loop through array items, and only go to next item when return true?
[01:58:44] <Dr-Bombay> there's no function for that. Just write the loop.
[01:59:55] <minna> Dr-Bombay: But i want to control the looping of the array, like sequential. When the function is done, go to the next array item
[02:00:53] <beancurd> RA3OR: http://jsfiddle.net/xXXgs/
[02:01:55] <Dr-Bombay> minna: you want the function to run on an item, return, and then maybe run on the next item?
[02:02:49] <minna> Yes, but not asynchronal, but sequentially.
[02:03:21] <Dr-Bombay> if you write your own loop you will have complete control and it will run sequentially
[02:05:21] <ParanoidGal> Been tasked with recoding this site and removing all flash elements. Is there a way I could recreate the flash typing effect on front page with jQuery? http://www.billiemyers.com (beware autoplay music!!)
[02:07:09] <Dr-Bombay> you can create an image for each phrase and fade it in
[02:08:16] <ParanoidGal> True Dr-Bombay that's probably the simplest route. Thanks!
[02:08:53] <minna> Dr-Bombay: But if i run a function in an each loop, it will go to next function before the first one have finished.
[02:09:57] <Dr-Bombay> I don't know what an each loop is
[02:11:05] <Dr-Bombay> and Javascript for a web page runs on one thread
[02:11:35] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Just a  sec, will show you.
[02:12:03] <goddard> can some one help me out figuring this out
[02:12:08] <goddard> im using this example http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial
[02:12:40] <goddard> but I want to put an ajax call into this when the link is clicked but im not sure how I can add the variables to my link
[02:16:44] <beancurd> goddard, put it in the click(function (){//do ajax call here});
[02:17:39] <minna> Dr-Bombay: See here, the loop executes asynchronally. I need to be able to control when the next loop should occur http://jsfiddle.net/NDsUC/
[02:19:02] <RA3OR> beancurd: thanks, i have 3 options in select, i want to show the div on just one of the 3, on the other 2 to hide the div
[02:21:58] <goddard> beancurd: but if I have multiple links on a page I need to know which one of the links was clicked
[02:22:36] <Dr-Bombay> that makes more sense now
[02:23:17] <goddard> beancurd: since it is a link and the <a href=#dialog> is already assigned how do I get the needed valuse fro it like normally <a href=page.php?value1=hi&&value2=hihi ?
[02:23:30] <RA3OR> beancurd: http://jsfiddle.net/NhF2N/3/
[02:23:52] <xenaxon> how can I get the val of the newly selected option
[02:23:53] <xenaxon> ?
[02:24:12] <beancurd> RA3OR: http://jsfiddle.net/xXXgs/1/
[02:24:49] <beancurd> xenaxon: look at my link to RA3OR.
[02:24:51] * RA3OR points at beancurd: U the man
[02:26:49] <Dr-Bombay> minna: just a moment...
[02:26:54] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Ok
[02:26:57] <beancurd> xenaxon: use change(), val() and option:selected
[02:27:48] <xenaxon> beancurd: does not work for me
[02:27:50] <xenaxon> :)
[02:28:07] <beancurd> xenaxon: put it in a jsfiddle :D
[02:31:09] <xenaxon> beancurd:http://jsfiddle.net/Nx65C/
[02:31:49] <beancurd> goddard: might be a good idea to just change the href to the full link that you want it to goto, use jquery to override regular clicking behaviour, then listen for clicks on a href's with a particular class?
[02:32:02] <xenaxon> beancurd:http://jsfiddle.net/Nx65C/2/
[02:32:05] <xenaxon> update 2
[02:32:38] <beancurd> one sec.
[02:33:39] <xenaxon> beancurd:
[02:33:39] <xenaxon>               <?php
[02:33:40] <xenaxon>               $selected='&selected=';
[02:33:40] <xenaxon>               if(!empty($meta['category']) && trim($meta['category'])!="") {$selected.=$meta['category'];}
[02:33:40] <xenaxon>               wp_dropdown_pages('name=_my_meta[page]&show_option_none= '.$selected. '&hide_empty=0&show_count=1&hierarchical=1');
[02:33:40] <xenaxon>               ?>
[02:33:48] <minna> ARGFH
[02:33:50] <beancurd> whut.
[02:33:52] <xenaxon> sorry, Imeant t copy http://jsfiddle.net/Nx65C/3/
[02:33:53] <minna> Use a pastebin!
[02:33:59] <xenaxon> update 3
[02:34:03] <minna> xenaxon:  ok
[02:36:38] <xenaxon> beancurd: check nr. http://jsfiddle.net/Nx65C/5/
[02:36:44] <xenaxon> it's the best one you can work on
[02:36:52] <xenaxon> I just can't figure out why it's not working
[02:37:39] <beancurd> ok, so i'm looking at v5?
[02:38:22] <xenaxon> yes
[02:38:48] <xenaxon> the script is supposed to make the other 2 selects visible
[02:38:57] <xenaxon> when one of the options in the first select get's changed
[02:38:58] <xenaxon> :)
[02:39:02] <beancurd> ok.
[02:39:16] <beancurd> http://jsfiddle.net/Nx65C/6/
[02:39:18] <beancurd> there.
[02:39:55] <beancurd> use $ instead of jQuery. easier to type and read.
[02:40:04] <xenaxon> yes but
[02:40:20] <xenaxon> it doesn't work when there are more javascript libraries used
[02:40:28] <beancurd> fair enough.
[02:41:20] <NodeX> why use more js libs .. you dont need them if you have jquery
[02:41:26] <NodeX> you're just bloating your page
[02:41:48] <Dr-Bombay> minna, look at this  http://jsfiddle.net/jBNPd/1/
[02:41:55] <beancurd> nfi really. some people are into bloat.
[02:42:00] <beancurd> chubbychasers.
[02:42:04] <beancurd> the whole lot of them.
[02:42:05] <xenaxon> what was wrong with my script beancurd?
[02:42:06] <beancurd> :D
[02:42:08] <xenaxon> and thanks btw
[02:42:52] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Hm, nice, but nothing happens?
[02:43:06] <Dr-Bombay> maybe I forgot to update
[02:43:12] <Dr-Bombay> http://jsfiddle.net/jBNPd/2/
[02:43:43] <Dr-Bombay> I know the values are reversed. That still has to be fixed
[02:43:46] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Whoa, that's awesome.
[02:44:06] <minna> Dr-Bombay: So how does it work :)
[02:44:12] <beancurd> xenaxon: np, usage of bind was weird, i didn't really look at what was wrong, i just changed that one line so that the changing of the list was getting captured.
[02:44:13] <Dr-Bombay> and you can modify the function inside chainLink so that it will test the value before it schedules the next timeout
[02:44:49] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Hm, how do i reverse the order?
[02:46:03] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Would you mind commenting it, so i understand it better?
[02:46:11] <goddard> beancurd: can i get the link id some how using that .click function
[02:46:25] <goddard> beancurd: i tried alert(e.id) but it says undefined
[02:47:31] <beancurd> goddard: which one was yours again? too many windows open -_-
[02:48:50] <Dr-Bombay> I will
[02:49:15] <minna> Dr-Bombay: Thanks a million!
[02:52:40] <beancurd> goddard: this.id should work.
[02:57:01] <goddard> awesome beancurd now i just gotta put that in an ajax call
[02:57:45] <beancurd> nice.
[03:11:58] <Dr-Bombay> minna: http://jsfiddle.net/jBNPd/6/

[04:04:08] <NodeX> <div id='divLocker' > is a block level element which means it has 100% width
[04:04:23] <NodeX> meaning it's the width of its parent
[04:04:36] <NodeX> bubbling all the way to $(window)
[04:06:16] <motaka2> Please tell me why I get ($('#divContent').width()/2) == 1300 in this piece of code? http://pastebin.com/LraYUqqb
[04:07:50] <motaka2> NodeX: Would you please check my question ?
[04:08:22] <Famic> I have a malicious piece of obfuscated js, I'd like to know what it really does. Anyone would know an easy way to concatenate the funciton it builds ?
[04:09:28] <Famic> there is a bunch of \x76 or \u006F in there, and it ends up with $n = $9()
[04:09:44] <Famic> I guess what I need is to see $9 as a string
[04:13:59] <NodeX> I just told you why motaka2
[04:14:15] <hyperstream> motaka2, careful NodeX is a tricky kinda guy
[04:14:22] <c0defr3ak> hey
[04:14:26] <c0defr3ak> how is all?
[04:14:27] <NodeX> :P
[04:14:38] <motaka2> NodeX: I dont see your answer
[04:14:44] <NodeX> 12:04:02] <NodeX> <div id='divLocker' > is a block level element which means it has 100% width
[04:15:01] <hyperstream> meaning it's the width of its parent
[04:15:09] <NodeX> ^^ +1
[04:15:13] <NodeX> hehe
[04:15:33] <hyperstream> motaka2, just got to scroll up a little. its just above your last 'asking' of the question :)
[04:16:22] <NodeX> sorry my mistake 1 sec I read it wrong
[04:16:43] <NodeX> no, my answer is still correct
[04:16:59] <motaka2> hyperstream: NodeX contentLeftPos = (divWindowWidth/2) - ($('#divContent').contents().width()/2);
[04:17:06] <motaka2> that was teh soloution
[04:18:11] <NodeX> [12:06:10] <motaka2> Please tell me why I get ($('#divContent').width()/2) == 1300 in this piece of code? http://pastebin.com/LraYUqqb
[04:18:14] <NodeX> that was your question
[04:18:36] <NodeX> and the answer is that #divContent is a block level element and it's 100% width of it's parent
[04:18:45] <NodeX> that bubbles all the way to $(window)
[04:21:16] <c0defr3ak> how is jquery treating u coldhead?
[04:22:38] <NodeX> net splitttttt
[04:31:37] <raj> I'm not pleased with the marquee plugins I've seen
[04:31:56] <raj> can someone suggest how I can just make text move back and forth within a <td>?
[04:37:01] <raj> ok, forget it, I'll just add '...'
[04:37:22] <raj> how can I determine if the <p> tags text is longer than the <td> containing it?
[04:41:14] <NodeX> get the widths of them
[04:41:36] <NodeX> but <p> is a block level element and as such it's width is 100% of its parent
[04:43:00] <raj> display:block on p.mytd{}
[04:45:04] <raj> NodeX, keep going! :0
[04:45:05] <raj> :)
[04:45:22] <Famic> anybody can tell me what \x76 and \u0067 are ?
[04:45:29] <Famic> I mean, what kind of encoding
[04:46:42] <NodeX> \u0067 is a java char
[04:49:05] <NodeX> \x76 is hexdecimal iirc
[04:57:56] <FernandoBasso> Is the \u prefix always utf-8?
[05:02:05] <Famic> FernandoBasso: I think it's unicode

[06:04:42] <danny_> and im getting the id of the other parent element :/
[06:14:06] <skamikaze> danny_: console.log( $(this).parent().parent().attr('id') )
[06:14:32] <skamikaze> danny_: assuming you are using jquery - you can use .parents('selector') too

[07:24:56] <Jayflux> hi bar_
[07:24:58] <Jayflux> hi barrymcgee
[07:24:59] <Jayflux> *
[07:25:59] <barrymcgee> first time with this new IRC client - just maing sure it's working - thanks Jayflux
[07:28:25] <ML74> could someone help me with a jQuery click event not working?
[07:28:44] <barrymcgee> ML74 - I'll take a look
[07:29:31] <Jayflux> ML74 is it something you could put into http://jsfiddle.net ?
[07:29:41] <beancurd> aye.
[07:29:44] <ML74> not really. it works, but not where i've put it.
[07:29:47] <ML74> http://www.designbyml.com/washington/ Click 'Dining' then in the content, clicking 'Menu Name' should load a popup div, but it isn't working. However, if I change the click event to one of the navbar buttons, it works as it should.
[07:33:10] <barrymcgee> ML74 Is the ogic for this in menupopups.js ?
[07:33:13] <barrymcgee> logic*
[07:33:16] <ML74> yeah
[07:36:26] <beancurd> actually it looks like the logic is in the .html?
[07:37:02] <beancurd> oh wait. menu.
[07:37:06] <beancurd> sorry. i read wrong.
[07:42:01] <barrymcgee> ML74 Still looking..
[07:53:08] <ML74> ok
[07:57:09] <SnowPlane> Hello. I want to search a string for any word starting with 'http://' and then use replace() or some regex to add <a href="the_url_I_just_found">the_url_I_just_found</a>
[07:57:29] <ajpiano> ?g jQuery replaceText plugin @ SnowPlane

[07:57:59] <Tasser> can I get a css property of a dom object?
[07:58:19] <Tasser> oh, yep
[07:59:41] <SnowPlane> ajpiano: Thank you. Should I be using embolden()?
[08:00:08] <ajpiano> what do you think.
[08:00:44] <SnowPlane> Yes and no. Very new to jquery and javascript in general so honestly no clue.
[08:00:58] <ajpiano> that is an *example*
[08:01:15] <ajpiano> of how you'd use it if you wanted to make the matching items wrapepd with a <b> tag
[08:01:22] <ajpiano> which is what the word "embolden" me
[08:01:28] <SVetter> hi everyone
[08:01:33] <ajpiano> you you want a function that replaces it with the contents of the link
[08:01:47] <ajpiano> could be a little tricky for you given your level of experience, it would seem
[08:01:56] <Jayflux> hi ajpiano not seen you for a while. Is yayquery still going? :)
[08:02:20] <SVetter> I calculate the height of a div using .height() and I need to use this value when I go back to php
[08:02:33] <SVetter> how can I get the value out of the script into php?

[08:03:14] <Jayflux> ajpiano i suppose you're all more busy than ever
[08:03:36] <ajpiano> indeed
[08:03:51] <SnowPlane> ajpiano: I see, I think I've got it. Partially.
[08:04:10] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:04:21] <minna> ajpiano: Wzup?
[08:04:29] <ajpiano> SnowPlane: oh look, ben has another utility for doing exactly what you want https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-linkify
[08:04:37] <DukeDrake> is $('ul', this) a shorthand for $(this).find('ul') ?
[08:04:43] <ajpiano> minna: oh you know, just looking to aimlessly chat in the #jquery channel
[08:04:57] <ajpiano> DukeDrake: they do the same thing
[08:04:59] <Jayflux> DukeDrake yes
[08:05:07] <ajpiano> i wouldn't necessarily call it "shorthand" but basically yes, it is
[08:05:13] <minna> ajpiano: rightously so :-)
[08:05:47] <minna> Nice "shorthand" didn't know that one.
[08:05:51] <DukeDrake> cool
[08:06:04] <DukeDrake> are there more of these? ^^
[08:06:45] <Jayflux> DukeDrake try typing into google 'things you didnt know about jQuery'
[08:07:28] <DukeDrake> XD
[08:08:09] <minna> Um, i'm not sure about not having to use $(document).ready() any more... is that really true?
[08:08:24] <SVetter> can anyone help me with that?
[08:08:57] <SVetter> did I not ask the question right?

[08:12:22] <Absolute0> I am using jquery to hide a link and fadeIn a hidden form. It works just fine in all browsers, except in chrome on OS X, the hidden form fails to fadeIn. What can I do to fix this?

[08:13:44] <minna> Jayflux: This is how i do it $(function() { // do something }); after body, so i was on track atleast :-)
[08:13:59] <Jayflux> yup
[08:14:20] <Jayflux> minna I would still keep it anyway, you may move your script to the top one day and use async instead

[08:33:12] <coolpro> Hello, it's not the first time I'm writting on here because of the same issue, but maybe someone could help me with the YoxView plugin to debug the code.
[08:33:35] <beancurd> whut.
[08:33:48] <coolpro> http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/norm5.html I'm getting an error.

[08:34:23] <k1t> hey folks, does jquery have an equiv. of http://mootools.net/demos/?demo=Drag.Scroll ? or is the closest thing Draggable in UI?
[08:35:06] <nVee> I want to add the selected attribution to a option based on it's value. I am using ajax to retrieve the value so I just want to select the current one from the db, what selector would I use to achieve this?
[08:43:46] <ParanoidGal> hey guys does anyone know of a simple audio player that will allow me to recreate something similar to the flash player and track list on the Listen page on http://www.billiemyers.com
[08:43:51] <ParanoidGal> Beware of autoplay!!
[08:54:55] <mssssm> I have a slight issue with persistent headers/navbars (jquery mobile): The content gets stuck under the navbar after you switch to a different tab the first time
[08:55:00] <mssssm> http://skysimulation.de:5000/
[08:55:04] <mssssm> ^try
[09:09:30] <jeremy--> are there any native jquery effects I can use to make two div's swap positions vertically in a nice way
[09:10:35] <thomedy> is anyone here
[09:10:57] <jeremy--> I guess i could use .position and .animate perhaps
[09:11:40] <beancurd> jeremy--: yep. then you're not limited to vertical.
[09:15:28] <jeremy--> does anybody know of a library or gallery where i can see some examples of div's being played around with animate. I've been googling examples and I think looking at ideas might improve my concept
[09:15:58] <thomedy> in jquery i should have normal scope right
[09:16:21] <thomedy> so if i have a click event incrementing a counter the counter will still be available with a sepereate if statement
[09:25:56] <thomedy> hello hello hello
[09:40:22] <Tasser> I've got <div><img><img></div>, and I've got the first img element. How can I get the second one? # $(frstimg.parent().find('img')[1]) isn't transitive if I use the second for a third one..
[09:44:05] <johnkpaul> ?next @Tasser
[09:44:05] <bot-t> Tasser, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:47:36] <Tasser> nice
[09:52:19] <mssssm> how do I preselect checkboxes with jquery mobile (without JS)?
[09:56:32] <jeremy--> This is a really novice question but how can i initilise an onclick/event/listener containing a jquery function AFTER document.ready
[09:57:21] <jeremy--> specifically, my current click event changes an attribute of a HTML element, and after which, my new click listener for the changed html element does not fire on click which I am assuming is an initilisation problem
[09:58:28] <LukeNukem> mssssm, try $("#checkboxid").val("checked");
[09:58:49] <LukeNukem> because thats the value a a checkbox will return if its checked
[09:59:12] <mssssm> Yeah, it's possible via javascript, but isn't it possible via plain HTML?
[10:00:16] <LukeNukem> mssssm, you can try setting a value attribute in html?
[10:01:13] <mssssm> LukeNukem: neither checked="yes" nor checked="checked" nor value="on" works
[10:01:47] <LukeNukem> mssssm, i figured it
[10:01:53] <mssssm> :(
[10:02:13] <LukeNukem> <input type="checkbox" name="Checkbox" value="ON" checked="">
[10:02:14] <LukeNukem> try
[10:02:51] <mssssm> Still
[10:02:51] <mssssm> http://skysimulation.de:5000/
[10:02:54] <mssssm> ^try
[10:03:15] <LukeNukem> try clearing cache or something?
[10:04:59] <mssssm> LukeNukem: oh, it works now
[10:05:00] <mssssm> strange
[10:05:02] <LukeNukem> mssssm, its default ticked for me mate
[10:05:09] <LukeNukem> maybe it was your cache?
[10:05:26] <mssssm> yeah
[10:19:34] <jeremy--> I'm a little confused, I've created a nice set of toggle animations, however, i want my jquery controls to fire from two different places. How can i create a function so that the code from both jquery on click events fire some script from one library
[10:19:42] <jeremy--> In short, how can i create a function?
[10:19:56] <shoky> ?eval $().jquery
[10:20:00] <bot-t> shoky: "1.4.2"
[10:20:05] <shoky> eh
[10:20:27] <LukeNukem> jeremy--, (function(){ });
[10:20:43] <LukeNukem> i guess
[10:20:47] <jeremy--> so would it be like function functioName () {}?
[10:20:52] <jeremy--> I just cant find it in the wiki
[10:21:09] <LukeNukem> try function functionName({ });
[10:25:22] <kapo7789> jeremy--: function functionName() {} - right
[10:27:27] <tnarb> maybe roll a plugin? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:29:25] <jeremy--> Thanks, i realised i was making a mistake elsewhere, the syntax is so obvious :D

[11:00:55] <jcp_> having some trouble figuring this out: http://jsfiddle.net/Zmae8/. if you click the text, it selects the box. but when you select the box, it doesn't work
[11:01:06] <LukeNukem> why is it when i use .text and .appendTo if there is html in the content im appending
[11:01:11] <LukeNukem> it goes just as text
[11:01:16] <LukeNukem> and it works different when using .append
[11:01:23] <pifantastic> use .html
[11:01:31] <pifantastic> .text will strip out any html
[11:02:03] <Wilornel> Guys, how to make an event be possible only every 2 seconds
[11:02:17] <Wilornel> What I mean is that you know the mousemove() event?
[11:02:31] <Wilornel> Well, in my script, it executes an ajax request...
[11:02:47] <Wilornel> I would like to limit these requests to 1 per each 2 seconds
[11:02:50] <LukeNukem> pifantastic, is there any other way to escape html in jquery
[11:03:09] <Wilornel> Because if I don't do it, there are too many ajax requests
[11:03:33] <pifantastic> ?g jquery throttle
[11:03:34] <bot-t> pifantastic, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[11:04:07] <jcp_> Wilornel: what kind of requests are you doing? like are you retrieving data or posting something?
[11:04:10] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, i have what you are looking for
[11:04:18] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, PM?
[11:04:48] <LukeNukem> you can use debounce or throttle
[11:05:03] <LukeNukem> or use setTimeout to make an ajax request where x seconds
[11:05:19] <Wilornel> ugm
[11:05:22] <Wilornel> uhm*
[11:05:27] <Wilornel> so... which method do I use?
[11:05:50] <LukeNukem> i use debounce
[11:05:55] <LukeNukem> want the code?
[11:05:59] <Wilornel> why not
[11:06:38] <LukeNukem> wait
[11:07:28] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, http://notey.it/n/ZHQ
[11:07:47] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, you will have to include this in your html
[11:07:48] <LukeNukem> <script type='text/javascript' src='includes/jquery/underscore/underscore.js'></script>
[11:07:55] <LukeNukem> i mean download underscore.js
[11:08:36] <pifantastic> Wilornel: there is also a jQuery plugin if you dont want to have to include underscore http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[11:08:49] <jcp_> http://jsfiddle.net/Zmae8/ anyone? try clicking the checkbox
[11:09:11] <LukeNukem> pifantastic, it works like ._debounce?
[11:09:14] <Wilornel> wait
[11:09:19] <Wilornel> what is the underscore for???
[11:09:32] <pifantastic> Wilornel: underscore is another library
[11:09:37] <pifantastic> an excellent library
[11:09:50] <Wilornel> debounce is only available in that library?
[11:09:50] <pifantastic> much like jQuery is an excellent library
[11:10:12] <pifantastic> Wilornel: there is a debounce implementation in underscore, but ben_alman also wrote a plugin for jquery
[11:10:16] <pifantastic> use whichever you prefer
[11:10:25] <Wilornel> Ill take the jquery one
[11:10:36] <LukeNukem> pifantastic, underscore.js is a framework like jQuery?
[11:10:46] <pifantastic> LukeNukem: not a framework, just a library
[11:10:51] <pifantastic> jQuery is also not a framework
[11:10:59] <pifantastic> it does not help you structure your application
[11:11:11] <pifantastic> it just provides utilities
[11:11:20] <LukeNukem> oh
[11:11:38] <Wilornel> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) { 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery ); 	} has no method 'debounce'
[11:11:52] <pifantastic> ?p @ Wilornel
[11:11:53] <bot-t> Wilornel, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:12:01] <Wilornel> It's a simple error
[11:12:14] <Wilornel> no method 'debounce'
[11:12:27] <pifantastic> Wilornel: you have to load the jquery plugin AFTER jquery and BEFORE your code
[11:12:56] <Wilornel> what?
[11:13:10] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, load jquery, load underscore, your code
[11:13:18] <Wilornel> I said I'll use the jquery method, not the underscore...
[11:13:32] <LukeNukem> never used that plugin
[11:13:35] <LukeNukem> ask pifantastic
[11:14:12] <Wilornel> pifantastic
[11:15:36] <pifantastic> ?p @ Wilornel
[11:15:36] <bot-t> Wilornel, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:15:39] <Wilornel> ok I'll try the underscore library..
[11:15:48] <isu> anyone can give me a hint how i can tell jqt to NOT load a iframe... but if i press a button it will load the iframe
[11:18:41] <isu> or maybe just could tell me how to prevent open the Maps app on iOS when i load a iframe with a googlemaps link in it

[11:31:11] <kitikonti> hi, is there a way to disable a jquery plugin i used bevore? i do for example $('.test').pluginName({blabla...}); and on a special action i dont want to use this plugin anymore
[11:45:31] <sht1144> hi , does anyone know of any good documentation for jquery tools / flowplayer tools ?
[11:47:07] <ericandrewlewis> does jquery animation scale well? i'm revisiting some code for a jquery based side-scroller, wondering if i should be worrying about killing elements that are off-screen
[11:50:03] <kolix> hi guys, quick question
[11:50:04] <kolix> I need a quick simple solution to check to see if the user still has an internet connection using jquery and ajax
[11:50:15] <kolix> i was thinking maybe something like $.ajax().success().fail() or something
[11:50:46] <kolix> any ideas?
[11:51:59] <ericandrewlewis> kolix: that sounds like a good way to do it
[11:52:30] <kolix> could i just ping google.com or something or is there somthing better?
[11:53:24] <systemfault> ajax with a timeout is pretty much the only way I think
[11:53:32] <systemfault> s/way/portable way
[11:54:21] <ericandrewlewis> kolix: makes more sense to me to ping your own server but anything would work
[11:55:43] <kolix> http://pastie.org/3829720
[11:55:47] <kolix> how's this?
[11:56:14] <kolix> so on success: i could just submit the form
[11:57:06] <ericandrewlewis> kolix: i think you'll have to wrap your alert in a function, but other than that it looks good
[12:01:48] <kolix> http://pastie.org/3829756
[12:02:11] <kolix> do i need to wrap success in a function if I'm calling a function?
[12:02:43] <johnkpaul> kolix: no, but you don't need the parens
[12:02:59] <johnkpaul> remove () after submitForm, and you should get the behavior you're looking for
[12:03:07] <kolix> ok awesome
[12:03:08] <kolix> thanks
[12:03:18] <kolix> what about the error callback?
[12:03:52] <kolix> look ok?
[12:11:28] <raj> I'm trying to get the width of a <td>, but I keep getting 0, any idea?
[12:12:56] <raj> oh
[12:13:10] <raj> cuz I'm trying to get the width of an element I haven't yet added
[12:14:16] <raj> silly me
[12:16:21] <raj> in fact, I'm giving a cell a max-width of 10px in the css, but when I check its width with js, it says 45px!?
[12:16:24] <raj> how is this possible?
[12:16:47] <vmx> hi. is there a way to monkey patch private functions in a widget create by the ui widget factory? i can't get it work the usual way
[12:21:10] <kolix> hi guys
[12:21:37] <thomedy> is anyone in here working
[12:22:48] <kolix> http://pastie.org/3829839
[12:22:56] <kolix> my success function is neve rbeing called
[12:23:08] <kolix> my ajax request is getting cancled somehow
[12:23:10] <kolix> any ideaS?
[12:25:03] <systemfault> koki: webapp.com is your domain?
[12:25:20] <kolix> no
[12:25:24] <kolix> it's a correct domain
[12:25:38] <kolix> systemfault, i just put in webapp.com for pastie
[12:25:43] <kolix> it's actually calling my domain
[12:26:04] <kolix> still, somehow the request is being cancled
[12:26:24] <kolix> any ideaS?
[12:27:24] <kolix> do i have the wrong version of jquery?
[12:27:27] <thomedy> can i use event delegation techniques like .live, or .delegate, or .on to call .is
[12:27:45] <systemfault> kolix: I know there's a bug with chrome dev that sometimes show ajax transaction as canceledâ€¦ As for you code, it's look good
[12:27:59] <thomedy> cuz im checking for an element that is being appended
[12:28:46] <thomedy> systemfault do you know
[12:28:55] <thomedy> you seem like you know alot
[12:29:36] <systemfault> thomedy: I don't understand what you want to doâ€¦ .is is to test selectorsâ€¦ event delegation is a event handling tool..
[12:29:45] <thomedy> right im trying to combine that
[12:29:47] <thomedy> concept
[12:29:59] <thomedy> i have a selector/tag that i add witha  click event
[12:30:00] <systemfault> That's the part where it doesn't make sense :(
[12:30:11] <thomedy> it is a slide show tha ti have made
[12:30:23] <thomedy> as the slide show increments up the array i make the left arrow dissapear
[12:30:26] <thomedy> you know
[12:30:33] <thomedy> all the way right no need to go right any more
[12:30:39] <thomedy> no more right arrow kinda thing
[12:30:41] <thomedy> that works fine
[12:30:51] <thomedy> now i want to check if its hidden so i can re .show() it
[12:30:59] <thomedy> when i click the other way
[12:31:13] <systemfault> How is event delegation related to that?
[12:31:30] <thomedy> i dont know if just doing is by itself works with out checking later
[12:31:38] <thomedy> because before the first click its not in the dom
[12:31:41] <thomedy> heres the url
[12:31:53] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[12:32:36] <thomedy> or maybe more ideal is to have a way to pass variables by reference so that i can keep track of a counter
[12:33:13] <thomedy> that didn't work either because the variable changes in the click event  but isn't availabel for if statements outside of the click event
[12:34:22] <raj> how can I show '...' if a <p> tag goes beyond 80px?
[12:35:02] <thomedy> system fault have you given up
[12:35:08] <thomedy> if so its cool
[12:36:43] <wodemaye_> is there a way for me to get this --> http://zwibbler.com/shared/2181.png <-- from the number button switchers that i have now? http://jsfiddle.net/XVFpr/16/
[12:36:48] <blendedbychris> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/min#value << anyone know if you can set that with the css selectors
[12:36:56] <blendedbychris> typically you can do "digits"
[12:37:33] <jcp_> http://jsfiddle.net/Zmae8/ anyone? try clicking the checkbox
[13:08:36] <ML74> anyone got a decent html/jquery audio player? just need a play/pause button. nothing else.
[13:10:01] <shoky> jcp: that span.click handler runs before the checkbox entered the checked state
[13:10:09] <egrouse> ML74: html5 <audio> tag?
[13:10:19] <ML74> does it work with all browsers though?
[13:10:24] <egrouse> all html5 browsers
[13:10:41] <ML74> is there anything that works with older browsers too?
[13:10:47] <egrouse> flash
[13:10:54] <egrouse> :(
[13:11:08] <egrouse> what browsers do you need to support
[13:12:14] <tw2113> give older browsers a flash version and a tissue
[13:13:45] <shoky> jcp_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Zmae8/2/
[13:15:29] <jcp_> shoky: thanks! i can work with that
[13:16:02] <ML74> egrouse: i'm not sure. what's the best solution? :/
[13:18:35] <dekhaus_> Hi All.   I'm looking for a jQueryUI 'ninja' to help me on a project.   I have a few tricky issues with Draggables/Droppables that I need help with.   The questions are too involved and project specific to post.   Will pay $.  Email dekhaus@mac.com if interested
[13:19:07] <egrouse> ML74: i am honestly unsure mate; i have yet to really do much with audio recently. I know that all the modern 'major' browsers support it, but if you're trying to target older browsers you will need to use another solution such as flash
[13:20:23] <ML74> i hate flash lol
[13:21:19] <shoky> .mid plz
[13:22:36] <tw2113> everyone hates flash, flash is self loathing
[13:22:50] <tw2113> but you're either going to want to leave dinobrowsers in the tar, or buck up and use it
[13:23:09] <shoky> or .mid
[13:24:40] <ML74> using html5, how could i use one button for play/pause?
[13:30:29] <shoky> use the html5 audio API
[13:30:37] <shoky> play() and pause() ..
[13:33:38] <PutItOnTheRitz> Does this jqueryui thing allow me to pop up some kind of thing similar to the tooltip notification except better?
[13:38:20] <raj> how does http://www.uploadify.com/demos/ have multiple file selection in IE??
[13:38:27] <raj> (using the bottom demo
[13:38:28] <raj> )
[13:39:22] <shoky> that's flash no?
[13:39:33] <systemfault> Yes...
[13:39:39] <systemfault> It's flash, that's why
[13:39:56] <nVee> hey guys, can anyone assist me on how to assign a selected parameter to a select option based on a defined value? I am getting a result back from ajax and want the stored value as the selected option in a select element
[13:40:38] <nVee> I tried $("select[name='selectName'][value='"+data.option+']").attr("selected",true); but it did not work
[13:41:15] <shoky> is it multi-select?
[13:41:22] <nVee> no, single select
[13:41:27] <nVee> well normal
[13:41:42] <shoky> then just $("select[name='selectName']").val( data.option )
[13:41:42] <nVee> just want to add the attribute to the stored value, thats all :)
[13:41:49] <nVee> hmmm
[13:41:52] <nVee> let me try that quick
[13:42:34] <nVee> haha you're kidding, it's really that simple hahaha
[13:42:39] <shoky> ;)
[13:42:44] <nVee> I never even tried that, thinking it cannot be right
[13:42:49] <nVee> thats shoky :)
[13:42:52] <shoky> np
[13:42:56] <nVee> thanks* :P
[13:43:02] <shoky> lol
[13:43:08] <shoky> didnt notice
[13:44:08] <coolpro> Hello, when I open a page itself http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/pageVideos.html the links of thumbnails works, though when I load it using ajax into another page, they no longer work http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/#videos can anyone help me solve this?
[13:47:10] <Zhy> got a similar problem, I cannot apply .button() to newly loaded buttons :/
[13:49:00] <PutItOnTheRitz> God... I can't take another generic piece of crap.
[13:49:04] <PutItOnTheRitz> "uploadify"... Seriously?
[13:49:12] <coolpro> Zhy, I believe you've got to declare .button() after the content is loaded
[13:49:15] * PutItOnTheRitz explodes out of generic crap overload.
[13:49:25] <shoky> ?
[13:53:08] <Zhy> thanks coolpro, gotta try that, though I think I have done so and it didn't quite work... or which content do you mean, the content of the whole page or of the subdiv that I'M loading via ajax?
[13:55:15] <coolpro> Zhy, i'm a noob in jQuery, though if I load some external page with ajax and wanna use some jquery stuff with data, at the end of that external page I add <script></script> and between that I write all the declarations.
[13:58:51] <gotenks_ssj4> can someone helpme testing?
[14:05:01] <Zhy> I suppose it must have something to do with the fact that I use the cakephp framework and how that handles js related stuff, because when I put the script at the end of the loaded element, it doesn't work
[14:38:58] <Logikos> its there a nice easy jquery alternative to the html marquee tag ... to scroll a string accross the screen in full and then repeat it .. kinda like they do on the news
[14:40:37] <nVee> I want to assist a class to the last 2 columns in a td (4 columns) . I tried $("table").children("td:eq(3)").addClass("classname") (where 3 and 4 both returned nothing), any help will grealy be appreciated :)
[14:42:04] <shoky> nVee: .children only gets direct children, not all descendants
[14:43:11] <nVee> I see
[14:43:54] <nVee> i tried a different approach now to call $("table tr :first-child").addClass(""); which works (almost) :)
[14:44:29] <shoky> $('table tr td:nth-child(3)') maybe
[14:45:13] <nexion> if I .append an element that has .attr('id', 'myId') to some other element, is it safe to select it immediately with $('#myId') or can it possibly fail?
[14:45:33] <nVee> shoky: quite the genius :P
[14:45:42] <shoky> heh
[14:46:12] <gotenks_ssj4> neeed help testing

[14:47:58] <gotenks_ssj4> banking scammers does not send stuffs on irc
[14:47:59] <systemfault> People are stupid..
[14:48:17] <nVee> i stay in SA and a big scam here is people get emails from their "bank" saying they need to update their internet banking credentials
[14:48:24] <nVee> people fall for that one like crazy

[14:54:44] <gotenks_ssj4> not a bot
[14:54:48] <shoky> quite a community youve got there
[14:55:05] <gotenks_ssj4> is just a chat
[14:55:28] <RandalSchwartz> "just a chat".  I remember back when that's *all* we had.

[14:57:47] <nVee> theres a club?!
[14:57:51] <nVee> finally
[14:58:03] <RandalSchwartz> I won't belong to any club that would have *me* for a member. :)
[14:58:12] <nVee> hey gotenks_ssj4: that chat bot of your repeats the same messages the moment you say something
[14:58:18] <nVee> i dont think it's going to "Catch on"
[14:58:24] <RandalSchwartz> chat bot?
[14:58:40] <nVee> wait, it's not a bot, no, it's just a bug
[14:58:49] <nVee> (or feature, depends on your audience I guess)
[14:59:12] <gotenks_ssj4> is not a bot
[14:59:12] <gotenks_ssj4> is a chat room
[14:59:12] <gotenks_ssj4> =)
[14:59:18] <nVee> a buggy one then :P
[14:59:18] <shoky> chat bot, then
[14:59:34] <RandalSchwartz> I see only one of what gotenks_ssj4 is saying
[14:59:51] <nVee> gotenks_ssj4: There was 3 of us, and I'm willing to go with the the 3rd person also saw "bot" written all over it hahaha
[14:59:55] <nVee> damn scammers
[15:00:01] <shoky> GIRLZ
[15:00:02] <nVee> RandalSchwartz: exactly
[15:00:13] <gotenks_ssj4> [RandalSchwartz]: hehehe
[15:00:21] <nVee> the thing is he's not saying it, hes script appears to be programmed to say "Helllllooooo" whenever you say something
[15:00:25] <nVee> it's not a bot
[15:00:32] <shoky> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[15:00:37] <nVee> or that
[15:00:39] <RandalSchwartz> hooooooo!
[15:00:41] <gotenks_ssj4> lol
[15:00:47] <shoky> AsL??
[15:00:49] <RandalSchwartz> hi
[15:00:50] <gotenks_ssj4> i can not stop laugh
[15:00:58] <nVee> it's just a script written to automatically send you a message whenever you say something
[15:01:01] <RandalSchwartz> A/S/L/D
[15:01:05] <RandalSchwartz> age sex location database. :)
[15:01:10] <shoky> ;SS
[15:01:42] <nVee> still, don't think it's quite going to catch on gotenks_ssj4, people have grown custom to chatting to other people in chatrooms
[15:01:57] <RandalSchwartz> wait - so is there a bot or not?
[15:02:09] <RandalSchwartz> I'm presuming there isn't.
[15:02:17] <nVee> it depends on your definition of bot :P
[15:02:24] <gotenks_ssj4> is not a bot
[15:02:28] <gotenks_ssj4> is a bug
[15:02:31] <RandalSchwartz> in the sense that we're *all* just bots, I presume that we're all buts.
[15:02:34] <RandalSchwartz> bots. even.
[15:02:34] <nVee> gotenks_ssj4: simple yes / no
[15:02:53] <nVee> Is your script returning a message automatically when someone says something in your chat room?
[15:02:58] <RandalSchwartz> as far as I can tell, consciousness is an illusion.
[15:03:03] <gotenks_ssj4> no
[15:03:06] <gotenks_ssj4> is not!
[15:03:08] <gotenks_ssj4> is a bug
[15:03:10] <nVee> then it's a bug :P
[15:03:11] <nVee> hahahha
[15:03:19] <RandalSchwartz> it's not a bug, it's a feature!
[15:03:28] <gotenks_ssj4> lol
[15:03:41] <nVee> Wishful thinking if the feature is a sales tool :P
[15:03:46] <gotenks_ssj4> what the script said to you?
[15:03:51] <shoky> GIRLZ
[15:03:54] <gotenks_ssj4> lol
[15:03:56] <nVee> hahahahaha
[15:03:57] <gotenks_ssj4> uahhaaha
[15:04:01] <nVee> yeah that sounds abour right
[15:04:02] <kapo7789> where
[15:04:11] <shoky> @ UR YARD
[15:04:20] <gotenks_ssj4> lol
[15:04:29] <nVee> gotenks_ssj4: what I dont get is when you programmed your "bug", why did you have it say stuff like "GIRLZ", and HELLLLLLLLOOOOO and HIIII
[15:04:32] * kapo7789 runs at his yard
[15:04:50] <gotenks_ssj4> loooool
[15:05:01] <gotenks_ssj4> it is inside the database
[15:05:10] <nVee> someone had to put it there
[15:05:14] <nVee> I'm no expert
[15:05:16] <shoky> i was saying GIRLZ . . .
[15:05:25] <shoky> <-- fdfd
[15:05:30] <gotenks_ssj4> the script should take the chatroom database the chat history
[15:05:33] <kapo7789> like who would be surprised, taking into account at what channel we are :/
[15:05:36] <gotenks_ssj4> someone typed it
[15:05:40] <gotenks_ssj4> its very fun
[15:05:40] <kapo7789> heh
[15:05:46] <nVee> but databases generally dont come up with catchy phrases (as quoted by shoky GIRLZ . . .)
[15:06:16] <nVee> it really sounds like very fun
[15:06:33] <nVee> but i find this casual chat we're having a bit more appealing
[15:06:48] * shoky farts
[15:06:53] <nVee> o
[15:07:02] <nVee> well this is awkward
[15:07:10] <shoky> that's casual me
[15:07:37] <nVee> gotenks_ssj4: So is this bug of yours just a casual app youre trying to fix or are you looking at retail for this bad boy?
[15:09:36] <gotenks_ssj6> sorry, i had a connection down
[15:09:52] <gotenks_ssj6> my script have a database, for chat history
[15:10:15] <gotenks_ssj6> someone before, typed the GIRLS and hiiiiii
[15:10:17] <nVee> excellent, that's important
[15:10:43] <nVee> so what is this, a chatroom which chats 1 level down?
[15:10:53] <nVee> how will I ever get the message accross?
[15:11:07] <gotenks_ssj6> ?
[15:11:13] <gotenks_ssj6> i do not understand
[15:11:33] <nVee> neither do I
[15:17:55] <gotenks_ssj6> lets try again guys
[15:17:57] <gotenks_ssj6> http://190.120.226.251/chat/ajax-chat.php?room=sweet
[15:19:16] <nVee> I would but google says I shouldn't, it's reported for confusion
[15:19:21] <nVee> ;)
[15:19:40] <gotenks_ssj6> who is luiz?
[15:20:14] <Validatorian> when a selector matches multiple elements, how can I get an array of an attr of each? For example, $('.posts').attr('id') only returns the first id, even if $('.posts').length === 5
[15:20:39] <Validatorian> expected result is ['id1', 'id2', 'id3']
[15:20:45] <Validatorian> or something similar
[15:20:46] <johnkpaul> Validatorian: .map
[15:20:47] <ravenzz> ?map
[15:20:47] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[15:20:53] <Validatorian> ty
[15:22:24] <gnarf> you can .map( funciton() { return this.id } ).get()
[15:23:35] <ravenzz> .fap()
[15:23:43] <johnkpaul> .get? gnarf
[15:24:06] <gnarf> .get() returns the "array" inside the jQuery collection as an array
[15:24:16] <gnarf> otherwise its still wrapped in jQuery's prototype
[15:24:21] <gnarf> ?get

[15:27:28] <coolpro> Hello, i m having an issue. The FancyBox plugin is working here http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/json-test.html but not working on here: http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/#videos ... i don't know why...
[15:34:17] <shippy> anyone recommend a good jquery plug/primer/tutorial on how to implement input boxes that accept tags, but once selected, places a box around them?
[15:34:22] <shippy> similar to facebook, other popular sites right now
[15:36:27] <coolpro>  Hello, i m having an issue. The FancyBox plugin is working here http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/json-test.html but not working on here: http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/#videos ... i don't know why..
[15:39:52] <coolpro> hello?
[15:41:15] <tw2113> coolpro i don't see any instance of $('something').fancybox() in there
[15:41:57] <coolpro> tw2113: it is loaded using .load()
[15:42:21] <tw2113> where? which line?
[15:42:32] <tw2113> $("#pageContent").load(pageObject+'.html?t='+ Math.random()); ?
[15:42:51] <coolpro> tw2113, yes
[15:43:00] <tw2113> how does that use fancybox?
[15:43:15] <coolpro> and it loads: http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/pageVideos.html
[15:44:08] <tw2113> so you have something like http://pastebin.com/4juyhSLY coming in with the .load() function?
[15:45:13] <coolpro> at the end of the html page that is loaded
[15:45:52] <tw2113> if script blocks can still be used after import like that, then i learned something new
[15:45:57] <tw2113> if not, thn there's your problem
[15:46:32] <coolpro> http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/json-test.html
[15:47:01] <tw2113> i know it's working in your test html file
[15:47:06] <tw2113> but it's not using .load()
[15:48:46] <coolpro> how about view-source:http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/pageHome.html and http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/#home
[15:48:47] <coolpro> ?
[15:49:44] <Tasser> I've got the handler object here, can I unbind it?
[15:50:02] <min|dvir|us> Can you think of a better way to write http://jsfiddle.net/fnj3S/4/?
[15:54:55] <shoky> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fnj3S/5/
[15:56:23] <shoky> actually this works too http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fnj3S/7/
[15:57:06] <min|dvir|us> shoky: is there a way without using .each()?
[15:58:26] <shoky> there are other ways, none better that i know of
[15:58:40] <shoky> .each() is simple..
[15:59:18] <min|dvir|us> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fnj3S/7/ is the link to beat.
[15:59:49] <shoky> why not .each ?
[16:00:12] <min|dvir|us> shoky: because I don't like it.
[16:00:27] <shoky> hokay
[16:00:33] <Dr-Bombay> what a strange reason
[16:00:48] <min|dvir|us> Because I feel it should be able to work without .each.
[16:00:58] <shoky> .each is just a loop
[16:01:03] <shoky> nothing more
[16:01:12] <shoky> if you want, write the loop yourself..
[16:01:18] <min|dvir|us> Right, but why loop if .animate() already operates on each element.
[16:01:35] <shoky> and how does it operate on each element? by looping.
[16:01:47] <min|dvir|us> Did I say I don't want looping?
[16:01:51] <min|dvir|us> I don't want .each.
[16:01:53] <shoky> pretty much
[16:02:04] <min|dvir|us> So, anyone?
[16:02:29] <ngharo> most (all?) jquery methods call .each internally if passed passing an object where length > 1
[16:02:40] <min|dvir|us> ngharo: exactly why I don't want to use it again.
[16:02:51] <shoky> it wont be used again :\
[16:03:08] <ngharo> shoky: yep
[16:03:21] <min|dvir|us> Yes it will.
[16:04:00] <ngharo> by the time animate gets called, you're only operating on a single element jquery object
[16:04:04] <ngharo> so no, it wont.
[16:04:17] <min|dvir|us> ngharo: right, because it's already using .each.
[16:04:19] <min|dvir|us> I don't want to use .each.
[16:04:40] <ngharo> so dont
[16:04:47] <min|dvir|us> ngharo: don't know how not to.
[16:04:53] <ngharo> but your reasoning is stupid
[16:04:59] <min|dvir|us> Right-o. Thanks!
[16:05:08] <ngharo> :)
[16:06:19] <ngharo> the point is, it'll use .each regardless of whether you call it or not
[16:06:32] <min|dvir|us> ngharo: Right, but I don't want to use it TWICE.
[16:06:35] <shoky> no .each :)   http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fnj3S/8/
[16:06:39] <shoky> still stupid
[16:06:43] <ngharo> min|dvir|us: it wont
[16:06:47] <min|dvir|us> Yes it will.
[16:06:50] <min|dvir|us> Wow.
[16:06:53] <min|dvir|us> You guys are pretty hostile.
[16:07:01] <shoky> with good reason
[16:07:14] <ngharo> we're telling you it won't but you are not listening
[16:07:24] <min|dvir|us> ngharo: I can see the source right there.
[16:08:32] <shoky> o Mai Gawd it set up da loop but only 1 iteration this must be stewpid to da ballz?!?!
[16:08:56] <min|dvir|us> shoky: that's exactly how I type, and what I sound like.
[16:09:23] <min|dvir|us> I've provided a perfectly valid reason (I don't want to use the same thing twice) and you are just ignoring it.
[16:09:43] <min|dvir|us> shoky: I gotta say, you're pretty disrespectful to strangers.
[16:09:50] <min|dvir|us> Especially for someone who has been pretty respectful to you.
[16:09:56] <shoky> ignoring it? i answered your question and gave you fiddles
[16:10:11] <min|dvir|us> Just because it's the Internet doesn't mean you can talk to people that way. Learn some manners.
[16:10:32] <min|dvir|us> It makes you look bad, not me.
[16:10:42] <shoky> yessir
[16:12:07] <min|dvir|us> So are you telling me that jQuery will NOT use .each multiple times, or it will but that's OK?
[16:13:40] <shoky> it will not use .each multiple times
[16:15:19] <shoky> unless the queueing internals use .each, dunno about that
[16:15:35] <shoky> but the .animate() wont call each as it would for a collection
[16:16:06] <min|dvir|us> shoky: you sure about that?
[16:16:19] <shoky> pretty much
[16:16:26] <shoky> like i said, not about the queuing internals
[16:17:14] <min|dvir|us> I don't understand queue myself.
[16:17:18] <safire> how to do I a heredoc for passing multiple lines of html to .html()?
[16:17:30] <shoky> yes
[16:54:36] <rhino> why does this line of code not work?  $('#medslisting').append("<div style = 'width:85px;float:left;'><input id = '" + resp[6] + "' onclick = 'removeid = $(this).attr('id'); type= 'button' value= 'Del' style = 'height:20px;width:25px;float:right;background: green;'/></div><br /><br />");
[16:55:43] <rhino> I has to do with this portion:   onclick = 'removeid = $(this).attr('id');
[16:56:14] <RandalSchwartz> rhino - why so much literal text?
[16:56:33] <RandalSchwartz> create a class for the style.  add the click handler with jquery
[16:57:05] <rhino> RandalSchwartz:  tnx
[16:59:45] <tutilanbo> hi I have a question
[17:00:45] <tutilanbo> I need the son of votehistorycontainer with class votehistory
[17:00:52] <tutilanbo> $('._voteHistoryContainer').
[17:01:03] <tutilanbo> but I don't know what to put there
[17:01:07] <tutilanbo> any clues?
[17:03:59] <espressive> tutilanbo: Something like this? http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[17:07:13] <tutilanbo> it's one child of $('._voteHistoryContainer') with a given class
[17:08:46] <tutilanbo> so it would be something like                $('._voteHistoryContainer').nextAll("votehistory")
[17:08:48] <tutilanbo> correct?
[17:08:52] <shoky> why nextAll ?
[17:09:05] <shoky> $('._voteHistoryContainer').children('.votehistory')
[17:09:06] <tutilanbo> shoky: not sure, espressive suggested that
[17:09:11] <tutilanbo> ah ok
[17:09:29] <tutilanbo> I thought children always brings all the children
[17:09:31] <shoky> $('._voteHistoryContainer > .votehistory') would also work
[17:09:46] <shoky> tutilanbo it does but you can filter with a selector
[17:09:48] <espressive> shoky: ^^ yep
[17:10:04] <tutilanbo> thanks
[17:12:19] <espressive> tutilanbo: shoky next() will most likely also work but using the child selector syntax is much cleaner
[17:12:36] <shoky> next() wouldn't work
[17:12:42] <shoky> since it gets the next sibling, not child
[17:13:47] <fatguylaughing> What's the command to print out to the screen?
[17:13:50] <espressive> shoky: ah crap, you are right
[17:13:59] <shoky> to the screen?
[17:14:02] <shoky> to the console?
[17:14:11] <shoky> console.log('foo')
[17:15:23] <fatguylaughing> shoky: Thanks :)
[17:19:13] <rhino> how can I use jquery to alert the id of a clicked element?  I'm trying to do this, but to no avail:    $('.ptdeletebtn').live('click', function() {
[17:19:14] <rhino>     alert('hello from binded function call');
[17:19:14] <rhino> 	alert($(this).attr('id');
[17:19:14] <rhino> });
[17:25:48] <cortexman> jquerymobile is awesome, but how can I ensure that the javascript I write works on all those same platforms?
[17:26:13] <cortexman> i wrote a game recently using jqueryui, and discovered that it worked in FF/Chrome but not Safari, for exampl3e
[17:31:09] <shoky> rhino: alert(this.id)
[17:33:08] <tutilanbo> one more, sorry if this is too basic, I'll understand
[17:33:24] <tw2113> too n00bish? never
[17:33:49] <tutilanbo> what's the difference between $('._aaa') and $('.aaa')
[17:34:19] <shoky> class 'aaa' vs class '_aaa' ?
[17:35:04] <tutilanbo> and also $('#aaa')
[17:35:16] <shoky> that's id 'aaa'
[17:35:16] <RandalSchwartz> id='aaa' :)
[17:35:45] <tutilanbo> and $('aaa')
[17:35:50] <shoky> <aaa>
[17:36:01] <tutilanbo> like with . with ._ with # without nothing
[17:36:05] <RandalSchwartz> which normally doesn't exist. :)
[17:36:20] <RandalSchwartz> $('div') - on the other hand... :)
[17:36:21] <tutilanbo> is it like scope or something
[17:36:25] <shoky> ?101 @ tutilanbo
[17:36:26] <bot-t> tutilanbo, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:36:32] <shoky> mm
[17:36:40] <RandalSchwartz> more like "new to html" :)
[17:36:44] <RandalSchwartz> these are all CSS things
[17:36:54] <RandalSchwartz> ?CSS
[17:36:54] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[17:36:58] <RandalSchwartz> oops. no
[17:37:04] <shoky> ?selectors
[17:37:05] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[17:37:28] <RandalSchwartz> there we go
[17:37:30] <tutilanbo> aahhh so it's a css thing
[17:37:40] <tutilanbo> yes I read about that in css
[17:37:49] <tutilanbo> I just didn't relate it with jquery sorry :D
[17:37:58] <shoky> that's what the jquery docs are for
[17:38:01] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - $('.funky div') is every <div> within anything with a funky class
[17:38:25] <RandalSchwartz> but it's far more than that
[17:43:07] <tutilanbo> and sorry one more
[17:43:12] <tutilanbo> what about ._
[17:45:37] <tutilanbo> so .x is for elements with class x                                                   #x is for element with id x                             nothing is for an html element                                 what about ._
[17:46:26] <shoky> _ has no significance

[17:47:52] <shwaiil> hi
[17:49:12] <shwaiil> Q: Trough ajax, it's being returned some html. From this Html I would like to get a specific #ID element. How to do that ? Thanks
[17:49:47] <shwaiil> forget it
[17:49:48] <shwaiil> found how =)
[17:50:26] <tw2113> $('tag').attr('id'); ?
[17:56:45] <shwaiil> tw2113: I ment html nodes like <p>asaas</p> , so I did $('<html>... </html>').find('#Id');
[17:58:01] <tw2113> you could probably put the find on 'body'
[17:58:19] <tw2113> work on efficiency a little bit more
[18:00:09] <shwaiil> tw2113: I'm not sure If I explained properly. I'm not doing in body because I have the html structure, that's what's being returned in ajax
[18:00:38] <shwaiil> I'm actually getting some html, like "<html><body></body></html>"
[18:00:39] <tw2113> so no return value of <html><head></head><body></body></html> ?
[18:00:47] <tw2113> not all of that is guaranteed returned?
[18:00:58] <shwaiil> tw2113: it's guaranteed
[18:01:10] <tw2113> so you could hook onto the body tag instead of html
[18:01:14] <shwaiil> if you know a better way to find #ID for my case, that would be cool
[18:01:22] <tw2113> i'm just thinking optimization
[18:01:49] <shwaiil> so, how to do that ? because I can only use find if doing this $('<html><head></head><body></body></html>')
[18:02:06] <tw2113> $('body').find('#Id'); <---i assume
[18:02:08] <tw2113> not tested
[18:02:22] <shwaiil> let's say the ajax return is var data = <html><head></head><body></body></html>, I would do $(data)
[18:02:56] <shwaiil> tw2113: that wont work in my case because $(body) will be the actual html the script is running on
[18:03:12] <tw2113> isn't the body where the ID is?
[18:03:31] <shwaiil> tw2113: just a sec =)
[18:03:48] <shwaiil> the ajax return is var data = <html><head></head><body></body></html>
[18:04:01] <shwaiil> that's why $(body) is not valid for my case
[18:04:05] <shwaiil> do you see my point ?
[18:04:22] <shwaiil> I do $(data) so then I can use .find() or other jquery functions
[18:04:24] <tw2113> slightly
[18:04:31] <tw2113> but i'm not going t bicker more :D
[18:05:59] <RandalSchwartz> $('#foo', data_returned_from_ajax)
[18:06:02] <RandalSchwartz> does that work?
[18:06:20] <shwaiil> RandalSchwartz: thanks for the tip, just a sec
[18:06:23] <RandalSchwartz> should turn data_returned_from_ajax into a dom object as a jquery
[18:06:32] <RandalSchwartz> then query it to find #foo
[18:06:51] <RandalSchwartz> same as $(data_returned_from_ajax).find('#foo')
[18:06:52] <RandalSchwartz> but shorter :)
[18:07:19] <oojacoboo> anyone use the formatCurrency method?
[18:07:24] <oojacoboo> I think it's a plugin
[18:07:52] <shwaiil> RandalSchwartz: http://jsfiddle.net/5XNMN/3/
[18:07:54] <shwaiil> not sure if working
[18:08:05] <shwaiil> if you dont mind having a look
[18:08:52] <RandalSchwartz> that has a syntax error
[18:08:57] <RandalSchwartz> let me know when you've fixed that
[18:09:39] <shwaiil> RandalSchwartz: http://jsfiddle.net/5XNMN/4/
[18:09:40] <shwaiil> yes
[18:10:15] <RandalSchwartz> and still a syntax error
[18:10:21] <RandalSchwartz> <span id="abc">
[18:10:57] <shwaiil> RandalSchwartz: ah! Ok works fine then
[18:10:58] <shwaiil> thanks :D
[18:11:05] * RandalSchwartz bows
[18:11:07] <shwaiil> $('#abc',data)
[18:11:08] * RandalSchwartz hits head on desk
[18:11:09] <RandalSchwartz> ouch!
[18:19:45] <radiantstatic> I'm looking to make a form uneditable/inaccessable when a checkbox is unchecked. any advice on how to do that?
[18:20:03] <RandalSchwartz> how will they re-check it? :)
[18:21:48] <radiantstatic> it wil be outside
[18:21:58] <radiantstatic> the form
[18:22:26] <RandalSchwartz> so it's in a different form?
[18:23:48] <radiantstatic> well its all collectively part of a large form. sectioned off. if a section is activated via checkbox, it becomes accessible and editable. You know those forms that are grayed over until you choose to edit them (credit card billing info *Same as billing address style)?
[18:24:02] <RandalSchwartz> ... $myForm.find(':input:not(:disabled)').prop('disabled',true);
[18:24:07] <RandalSchwartz> that disables things
[18:24:18] <RandalSchwartz> add narrowing to taste
[18:24:20] <RandalSchwartz> ... $myForm.find(':input:disabled').prop('disabled',false)
[18:24:23] <radiantstatic> gracias
[18:24:25] <RandalSchwartz> that enables that
[18:24:40] <RandalSchwartz> so just put the proper hook on your checkbox
[18:24:48] <radiantstatic> will do
[18:26:21] <RandalSchwartz> $('#toggle').on('click', sub { $(this).closest('form').find('#subsection :input ...
[18:38:47] <tutilanbo> is this correct?
[18:38:48] <tutilanbo> .style(display, none);
[18:38:59] <beancurd> add quotes.
[18:39:09] <beancurd> 'display', 'none'
[18:39:13] <beancurd> and .css
[18:39:29] <beancurd> .css('display', 'none')
[18:39:31] <tutilanbo> .css('display', 'none')
[18:39:33] <ML74> If I have an iFrame open in a jQuery popup, is it possible for me to make the back button on the browser make the page inside the iframe go back?
[18:40:03] <tutilanbo> thanks
[18:43:11] <ML74> If I have an iFrame open in a jQuery popup, is it possible for me to make the back button on the browser make the page inside the iframe go back?
[18:46:11] <ML74> How could I create an animation over the top of all my website content while it's still loading?
[18:46:43] <RandalSchwartz> load a page that includes your animation, and an ajax call to replace the rest of the page
[18:46:53] <RandalSchwartz> I guess, anyway
[18:47:17] <RandalSchwartz> seems like the only proper way to do it
[18:47:29] <RandalSchwartz> since ajax is the only "async" thing you can do
[18:47:40] <ML74> hmmmm...
[18:48:03] <ML74> basically i wanna recreate the loading effect at http://www.washingtonbelfast.com on http://www.designbyml.com/washington
[18:48:12] <RandalSchwartz> sure - I know what you want to create
[18:48:29] <RandalSchwartz> but I'm thinking of what a browser limits us to do
[18:48:46] <ML74> hmmmm...
[18:49:18] <RandalSchwartz> so the core URL would return "start animation" "ajax load to replace #foo"
[18:49:32] <RandalSchwartz> and then the ajax would return the rest of the page
[18:49:50] <ML74> i'm gonna make it more complicated nowâ€¦ i'm using wordpress :/
[18:49:58] <RandalSchwartz> no idea.
[18:50:00] <RandalSchwartz> not a wordpress user
[18:50:12] <RandalSchwartz> but you'll have to get wordpress to return a partial page
[18:50:16] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise the load won't matter. :(
[18:50:31] <RandalSchwartz> you won't get control until the whole page is loaded at least once
[18:50:49] <RandalSchwartz> but "whole" can be partial if you control it from server
[18:52:15] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/throbber
[18:52:30] <wodemaye_> i'm a little confused about making ajax calls...
[18:52:58] <RandalSchwartz> what confuses you?
[18:53:12] <wodemaye_> how do you feed the results of your call back into your success function?
[18:53:20] <wodemaye_> i'll get a json file back.
[18:53:43] <RandalSchwartz> the results are automatically fed
[18:53:57] <RandalSchwartz> that's the "data" your callback gets
[18:54:25] <Wilornel> Guys, I would like to know if it is okay to go like so: function someFunc(theVariable){ $('#' +theVariable).click(); }
[18:54:37] <RandalSchwartz> you're talking about jQuery.ajax ?
[18:54:45] <coldhead> $.ajax({ ..., success: function (some_var) { ...; console.log( 'come see my etchings', some_var ); }, ... });
[18:54:59] <RandalSchwartz> what is some_var
[18:55:11] <RandalSchwartz> that's "data"? :)
[18:55:24] <RandalSchwartz> if not, you probably want a closure var
[18:55:31] <coldhead> i just read a post that called $data the worst var name in the world, so i stopped calling it that
[18:55:32] <shoky> Wilornel it's ok
[18:55:39] <ML74> I think I'll just stick with letting it load as it is lol
[18:55:53] <wodemaye_> http://jsfiddle.net/XVFpr/30/
[18:55:56] <RandalSchwartz> do you understand closure vars?
[18:55:57] <wodemaye_> see the alert statement.
[18:56:00] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, me?
[18:56:04] <wodemaye_> not really.
[18:56:20] <ML74> Also, I haven't been able to figure out why my popup won't load when I have the <a> within content, but if I have the event for a navbar button, it works. Any ideas?
[18:56:21] <RandalSchwartz> where is "msg" coming from?
[18:56:35] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, the contents of my json file from the server, no?
[18:56:52] <RandalSchwartz> sure
[18:56:56] <Wilornel> shoky: Alright thanks.
[18:57:01] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, I don't know, i'm asking...
[18:57:02] <RandalSchwartz> is your server returning JSON?
[18:57:22] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, it will be, I haven't gotten to that part of the design yet.
[18:57:27] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - do that
[18:57:32] <RandalSchwartz> and then you'll see that "msg" makes sense
[18:57:33] <Wilornel> Does someone know what I did wrong? The browser says: unrecognized expression... https://gist.github.com/2440759
[18:57:42] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, should i be coding my php first?
[18:57:52] <RandalSchwartz> wodemaye_ "first"?
[18:58:00] <shoky> Wilornel:  <script src="jquery.js"></script>
[18:58:02] <shoky> oops
[18:58:06] <shoky> er
[18:58:12] <wodemaye_> i mean i pretty much already have, just need to polish it and string all the pieces together.
[18:58:18] <shoky> Wilornerl: you got no <script> tag around your script
[18:58:34] <Wilornel> around which one?
[18:58:40] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, but assuming my server'll be returning json, that's the right way to do it right RandalSchwartz ?
[18:59:04] <RandalSchwartz> I think that's the default
[18:59:07] <shoky> Wilornel the addUnanswered function
[18:59:10] <RandalSchwartz> you might be able to return XHTML too
[18:59:14] <Wilornel> oh yeah
[18:59:15] <Wilornel> one sec
[18:59:36] <Wilornel> voila https://gist.github.com/2440759
[18:59:38] <RandalSchwartz> you can't have <script src="..."> and then more JS there
[18:59:43] <Wilornel> still doesn't work
[18:59:47] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, what should I be interchaning in xhtml or json?
[18:59:55] <shoky> daznt w0rk
[19:00:05] <Wilornel> does not*
[19:00:12] <shoky> its a paste, its working fine
[19:00:16] <shoky> text daznt w0rk
[19:00:20] <Wilornel> what?
[19:00:23] <shoky> hm?
[19:00:27] <Wilornel> what???
[19:00:36] <Wilornel> so what is the problem?
[19:00:38] <shoky> ?it's not working
[19:00:42] <bot-t> shoky, #2910 (:visible not working on safari) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2910
[19:00:44] <shoky> ;\
[19:00:46] <RandalSchwartz> wodemaye_ - most people use JSON these days
[19:00:54] <RandalSchwartz> XML is crazy :)
[19:00:58] <shoky> Wilornel: watz da problem?
[19:00:59] <Wilornel> shoky: ...
[19:01:03] <shoky> ...
[19:01:07] <RandalSchwartz> and far more inneffiient
[19:01:09] <Wilornel> shoky: it says: unrecognized expression
[19:01:09] <wodemaye_> wodemaye_, k. thanks.
[19:01:12] <RandalSchwartz> please stop with the "..."
[19:01:16] <RandalSchwartz> either say something, or say nothing
[19:01:18] <shoky> who says, where
[19:01:21] <shoky> about what line
[19:01:26] <RandalSchwartz> "..." is a vanity crap line
[19:01:41] <Wilornel> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #[object HTMLDivElement]      jquery.js: 4267
[19:01:42] <shoky> nah i'll say ... at times
[19:01:52] <RandalSchwartz> shoky - and then I'll continue to bitch
[19:01:57] <shoky> goody
[19:02:00] <RandalSchwartz> because WHAT PURPOSE does "..." serve
[19:02:04] <RandalSchwartz> NONE.  NONE WHATSOEVER
[19:02:06] <Wilornel> and for the gist.github its about at line 16
[19:02:08] <RandalSchwartz> we know you're there.
[19:02:11] <shoky> for you maybe
[19:02:16] <RandalSchwartz> no - for everyone
[19:02:17] <shoky> for me it serves many purposes
[19:02:31] <RandalSchwartz> damn kids
[19:02:40] <RandalSchwartz> messing up the internet we built for them
[19:02:56] <Wilornel> randal: It shows the other people you are waiting for him or are bored of what he says, etc
[19:03:01] <coldhead> wodemaye_: i usually just put a static file of dummy json on the server while i'm teaching javascript how to retrieve it, then once they're talking i replace the static json file with the dynamic whatever that should actually be there
[19:03:01] <shoky> Wilornel: you're calling addUnanswered(bob)
[19:03:03] <shoky> what is bob?
[19:03:06] <shoky> there is no bob
[19:03:20] <shoky> bob is the unrecognized expression
[19:03:20] <RandalSchwartz> "What about Bob?" :)
[19:03:25] <Wilornel> shoky: what do you mean?
[19:03:28] <Wilornel> bob is the argument
[19:03:34] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/
[19:03:35] <shoky> dude
[19:03:43] <shoky> yes, you are giving bob as the argument
[19:03:49] <shoky> but you never declared any bob anywhere
[19:03:52] <shoky> in the javascript
[19:03:57] <Wilornel> OH I SEE
[19:03:57] <RandalSchwartz> you might want to pass 'bob' instead of bob
[19:04:04] <Wilornel> shoky.... uhm yes i did
[19:04:09] <Wilornel> actually the problem is that
[19:04:10] <RandalSchwartz> bob might not want to be passed. :)
[19:04:20] <Wilornel> on line 16, I didnt put single quotes
[19:04:25] <Wilornel> exactly
[19:04:27] <RandalSchwartz> or it might be painful to pass bob
[19:04:28] <shoky> yeah that's what i said.
[19:04:38] <shoky> i said you didn't declare bob. not 'bob'
[19:04:42] <Wilornel> lol
[19:04:44] <Wilornel> alright I see
[19:04:49] <Wilornel> Thanks a ton!
[19:04:57] <RandalSchwartz> bob might be a "do not pass"
[19:05:03] <RandalSchwartz> "do not pass bob.  do not collect $200"
[19:05:05] <shoky> ...
[19:05:17] <RandalSchwartz> /ignore shoky
[19:05:21] <shoky> please
[19:05:22] <coldhead> hahah you earned that ellipsis, RandalSchwartz
[19:05:29] <coldhead> you can't complain
[19:05:35] <RandalSchwartz> sure I can
[19:05:39] <RandalSchwartz> I'm old and cranky now
[19:06:24] <coldhead> try not to upset papa schwartz, shoky
[19:06:27] <RandalSchwartz> when 571,000 web pages mention my name, I get a bit of grace.
[19:06:31] <shoky> ;)
[19:06:46] <RandalSchwartz> try http://lmgtfy.com/?q="randal l. schwartz" OR "randal schwartz" OR "schwartz, randal"
[19:07:04] <shoky> that would serve a ton of purpose
[19:07:09] <shoky> too much purpose, sorry
[19:07:17] <coldhead> i give more weight to my bookshelf real estate occupied by your work, RandalSchwartz
[19:07:24] <coldhead> i paid for that stuff
[19:07:25] <RandalSchwartz> thanks.
[19:07:34] <RandalSchwartz> and I made a lunch or two from you, so thanks
[19:07:39] <coldhead> hahahah
[19:07:53] <RandalSchwartz> at $1.50 per book pre-tax, it takes a while :)
[19:08:02] <coldhead> i got more than a few lunches from what i learned
[19:08:07] <coldhead> it seems unfair
[19:08:12] <RandalSchwartz> it's the game.
[19:08:16] <RandalSchwartz> you don't write to get rich
[19:08:21] <RandalSchwartz> you write to get fame
[19:08:24] <coldhead> well its been fun and lunch is good
[19:08:29] <RandalSchwartz> if you're smart about fame, you can get rich. :)
[19:08:47] <RandalSchwartz> I wrote 255 magazine articles
[19:08:56] <RandalSchwartz> not for the money, but because they were a 4-page ad for my services
[19:09:47] <coldhead> i didn't even realise, i thought you were sharing your love of smalltalk for purely altruistic reasons
[19:09:57] <RandalSchwartz> ha!
[19:10:01] <RandalSchwartz> you know so little of me! :)
[19:10:17] <RandalSchwartz> why do you think I do FLOSS Weekly?
[19:10:24] <RandalSchwartz> 50K people download me every week :)
[19:11:04] <RandalSchwartz> why do I post 10 things a day to my 15K followers on G+ or my 10K followers on twitter?
[19:11:08] <RandalSchwartz> it's all about fame. :)
[19:11:24] <RandalSchwartz> anyway, this isn't #randal.  it's #jquery
[19:11:33] <RandalSchwartz> sorry for the intrusion.  back to my rock.
[19:13:10] <coldhead> now i'll be wondering if the karaoke is just advertising too
[19:13:24] <coldhead> WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS
[19:13:26] * RandalSchwartz . o O (why would that be in question)
[19:14:53] <shoky> o it seems i've read 2 of your books
[19:15:04] <coldhead> <3
[19:15:14] <shoky> indeed
[19:15:21] * shoky chomps
[19:15:39] <RandalSchwartz> shoky - thank you
[19:16:02] <RandalSchwartz> unless you just borrowed them, in which case, f*** you. :) :)
[19:16:14] <RandalSchwartz> seriously, either way.  thanks
[19:16:15] <shoky> :) i bought one :P
[19:16:46] <RandalSchwartz> what torques me most is when people post pointers to pirated copies of my books
[19:16:47] <fatguylaughing> So http://pastebin.com/QeSpMNPV I get the following JQuery errors in my dev error log. https://www.evernote.com/shard/s44/sh/740ac51b-3d3b-48b9-8df1-8769ec4f686d/a2b42022c07a182664f8c29daa02278b
[19:16:55] <RandalSchwartz> evernote!
[19:17:06] <fatguylaughing> I read the http://api.jquery.com/animate/ and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
[19:17:25] <fatguylaughing> RandalSchwartz: Yeah was using Skitch before they bought it out :D
[19:18:04] <RandalSchwartz> yeah skitch was cool
[19:18:20] * RandalSchwartz is waiting for posterous to stop functioning now that twitter owns the people
[19:18:32] <fatguylaughing> RandalSchwartz: hehe
[19:18:35] <RandalSchwartz> posterous is far better than tumbler
[19:20:43] <wodemaye_> http://www.webdevout.net/test?01u <-- RandalSchwartz, check it out - i've set it up with a kind of pseudo-/static- json for fleshing out the clientside.
[19:21:36] <wodemaye_> is there a way that i could have the success function replace the images with the ones specified towards the end of http://www.webdevout.net/test?01t&raw ?
[19:21:38] <Dr-Bombay> fatguy: there is no backgroundColor property, only a background-color property
[19:21:59] <shoky> backgroundColor should work fine
[19:22:01] <coldhead> that's quite a regex you got there wodemaye_
[19:22:11] <RandalSchwartz> that regex should be built from pieces.
[19:22:15] <RandalSchwartz> it was, originally. :)
[19:22:18] <wodemaye_> coldhead, it's actually lifted from a jq plugin.
[19:22:32] <wodemaye_> via stackoverflow.
[19:22:37] <RandalSchwartz> the fun one is an email validator.
[19:22:39] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, what do you mean?
[19:22:41] <wodemaye_> oh, yeah.
[19:22:42] <RandalSchwartz> it's about 1500 chars long
[19:22:46] <wodemaye_> those are ridiculous.
[19:22:49] <Dr-Bombay> shoky: even if it does that's no reason to switch between them randomly
[19:22:50] <RandalSchwartz> anything less is BROKEN
[19:23:04] <shoky> Dr-Bombay: yup
[19:23:14] <RandalSchwartz> and even the 1500 char one doesn't respect ( ) comments
[19:23:23] <RandalSchwartz> those are supposed to be pre-filtered
[19:23:25] <wodemaye_> what are ( ) comments?
[19:23:29] <wodemaye_> oh jesus.
[19:23:33] <RandalSchwartz> merlyn(hey ho)@stonehenge.com
[19:23:36] <RandalSchwartz> perfectly legal
[19:23:42] <RandalSchwartz> and would send to me
[19:23:57] <RandalSchwartz> what's worse is they can be nested:
[19:24:02] <wodemaye_> is that your email address? if it is, its awesome.
[19:24:10] <RandalSchwartz> merlyn(hey (ho) ha)@stonehenge(foo).(bar)com
[19:24:12] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, I didn't realize that.
[19:24:14] <RandalSchwartz> that's also legal
[19:24:29] <Wilornel> What?
[19:24:32] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - that's why everyone who WRITES an email regex matcher GETS IT WRONG
[19:24:33] <Wilornel> those are equivalent?
[19:24:36] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[19:24:39] <RandalSchwartz> () is comments
[19:24:40] <fatguylaughing> Dr-Bombay: I'll try it the other way.
[19:24:45] <Wilornel> ohhhhh okay
[19:24:52] <Wilornel> Uhm guys
[19:25:04] <RandalSchwartz> merlyn(the wizard)@(yes that's at)stonehenge(coming up is a dot).com(mercial)
[19:25:06] <RandalSchwartz> also equivalent
[19:25:12] <Wilornel> I would like to know if there is a function in jquery that works like prepend but not exactly
[19:25:25] <RandalSchwartz> .prependNotExactly I think
[19:25:30] <shoky> not exactly
[19:25:34] <fatguylaughing> Dr-Bombay: Same results as before.
[19:25:34] <Wilornel> look, I have a div, and an input in this div
[19:25:36] <Dr-Bombay> .sortOfPrepend
[19:25:38] <Wilornel> so it goes like so
[19:25:39] <fatguylaughing> This is bizarre
[19:25:42] <RandalSchwartz> .prependIsh
[19:25:46] <shoky> :D
[19:25:59] <Wilornel> <div class='someClass'><input id='someInput'/></div
[19:26:01] <Wilornel> <div class='someClass'><input id='someInput'/></div>
[19:26:09] <wodemaye_> RandalSchwartz, lol.
[19:26:10] <Wilornel> and now, I want to add something before this input
[19:26:18] <shoky> prepend?
[19:26:20] <shoky> ish?
[19:26:30] <RandalSchwartz> .prepend.ish()
[19:26:31] <Wilornel> <div class='someClass'><p>Some text here</p><input id='someInput'/></div>
[19:26:34] <Wilornel> guys...
[19:26:35] <Wilornel> enough...
[19:26:42] <oojacoboo> how do I convert a string or number into a jquery object within a function for use with a jquery plugin that expects a jquery object?
[19:26:49] <Wilornel> It made me laugh but not anymore
[19:26:50] <RandalSchwartz> Wilornel - that's insert
[19:27:09] <Wilornel> oh alright thanks cool! :D
[19:27:14] <RandalSchwartz> oh wait
[19:27:16] <shoky> huh
[19:27:18] <RandalSchwartz> given what... the ID?
[19:27:20] <oojacoboo> I have this right now, but not having much successâ€¦  String.prototype.formatCurrency = function() { $(this) = this; return $(this).formatCurrency; };
[19:27:21] <RandalSchwartz> or the class?
[19:27:27] <Wilornel> it would go like so
[19:27:30] <Dr-Bombay> sounds like .before to me
[19:27:31] <wodemaye_> anyway RandalSchwartz or coldhead do you know how one could achieve what I described?
[19:27:32] <RandalSchwartz> oojacoboo - OUCH
[19:27:32] <Wilornel> i suppose:
[19:27:39] <RandalSchwartz> $(this) = this?
[19:27:42] <RandalSchwartz> that's not gonna work
[19:27:42] <oojacoboo> ?
[19:27:48] <Wilornel> $('#someInput').insertBefore('sometext');
[19:27:51] <oojacoboo> ok, well, please advise :)
[19:27:56] <RandalSchwartz> maybe you want $this = $(this)
[19:27:56] <Wilornel> or no
[19:28:03] <Wilornel> $(this).insertBefore('sometext');
[19:28:17] <RandalSchwartz> and then use $this
[19:28:22] <oojacoboo> why the $ before this?
[19:28:23] <shoky> ?insertBefore
[19:28:24] <RandalSchwartz> but as written, not at all correct
[19:28:24] <bot-t> .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[19:28:33] <RandalSchwartz> oojacoboo or leave it out
[19:28:34] <oojacoboo> RandalSchwartz: and that function doesn't get a jquery object
[19:28:41] <Wilornel> be right back
[19:28:44] <oojacoboo> it gets a string
[19:28:55] <RandalSchwartz> return $(this).formatCurrency()
[19:28:58] <RandalSchwartz> or something like that
[19:29:04] <RandalSchwartz> well - it always gets a "this" :)
[19:29:05] <oojacoboo> I have thatâ€¦ :/
[19:29:10] <oojacoboo> right...
[19:29:12] <RandalSchwartz> no you don't
[19:29:18] <RandalSchwartz> you have .formatCurrency
[19:29:23] <RandalSchwartz> which would return the function
[19:29:36] <oojacoboo> String.prototype.formatCurrency = function() { $(this) = this; return $(this).formatCurrency; };
[19:29:39] <RandalSchwartz> the () makes a difference
[19:29:46] <oojacoboo> oh shit...
[19:29:49] <oojacoboo> dooop
[19:30:00] <RandalSchwartz> oojacoboo PLEASE STOP WRITING DISFUNCTIONAL CODE that I've already disclaimed

[19:33:01] <wodemaye_> it's missing that one comma on L2, but i fixed that and it's still complaining.
[19:33:06] <RandalSchwartz> ?eval $('<ul>').text
[19:33:07] <bot-t> RandalSchwartz: <function (text) {if (jQuery.isFunction(text)) {return this.each(function (i) {var self = jQuery(this);self.text(text.call(this, i, self.text()));});}...
[19:33:15] <RandalSchwartz> ?eval $('<ul>').text()
[19:33:16] <shoky> derp
[19:33:16] <bot-t> RandalSchwartz: TypeError: elems is undefined
[19:33:19] <RandalSchwartz> heh!
[19:33:27] <shoky> Wut
[19:33:45] <coldhead> wodemaye_: jsonlint will tel you the problems
[19:33:55] <coldhead> it needs to start with [, i think
[19:34:37] <coldhead> wodemaye_: http://jsfiddle.net/PVQ75/ <-- this has valid JSON which i'm just straight up assigning to a var, but you can see at the end a way to pluck out and show some images
[19:34:41] <wodemaye_> coldhead, yeah, but it was just a very undescriptive complaint that it gave me.
[19:35:02] <coldhead> wodemaye_: its usually better to have a machine generate your JSON anyway
[19:35:08] <coldhead> less error prone
[19:35:18] <coldhead> data entry is for gimps
[19:35:59] <oojacoboo> can someone explain then what I'm missing here?  String.prototype.formatCurrency = function() { return $(this).formatCurrency(); };
[19:36:09] <wodemaye_> coldhead, okay, good to know.  i'll do that with a real json encoder on my live code.
[19:36:16] <oojacoboo> suppose to convert the string to object and pass to that jquery method
[19:36:28] <RandalSchwartz> wait - why are you turning a string into a jquery object
[19:36:38] <oojacoboo> that's what that method expects
[19:36:40] <RandalSchwartz> oh - then maybe that's what you want
[19:37:00] <RandalSchwartz> where is jQuery.prototype.formatCurrency defined?
[19:37:08] <oojacoboo> in a helper
[19:37:17] <oojacoboo> oh
[19:37:18] <RandalSchwartz> what's the error?
[19:37:28] <oojacoboo> jQuery.prototype, no
[19:37:34] <oojacoboo> $.fn.formatCurrency
[19:37:41] <RandalSchwartz> that might do it
[19:37:44] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not sure how the layers work
[19:37:49] <oojacoboo> I'm not either
[19:37:53] <RandalSchwartz> <<== not a jq or js expert
[19:37:58] <wodemaye_> coldhead, check my previous link or better yet: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01w&raw#image4
[19:38:13] <RandalSchwartz> see if $('').formatCurrency is valid
[19:38:17] <RandalSchwartz> if not, it's not defined right
[19:38:23] <oojacoboo> it's a TypeError
[19:38:29] <RandalSchwartz> bad news
[19:38:40] <coldhead> wodemaye_: syntax error on line 8, you;re missing a , after the URL pair
[19:38:43] <wodemaye_> coldhead, try clicking on the numbered buttons 2-4.
[19:38:46] <wodemaye_> i got it.
[19:38:51] <wodemaye_> so check the updated one http://www.webdevout.net/test?01w&raw#image4
[19:40:04] <wodemaye_> coldhead, are you sure you don't mean line 2?
[19:40:21] <coldhead> possibly, i'm just going off what the debugger is telling me
[19:41:48] <wodemaye_> coldhead, so i'm not looking to just spit the images out on the page, i have a predefined div in which to put them.
[19:41:56] <wodemaye_> did you try clicking the numbered buttons 2-4?
[19:41:59] <coldhead> the numbers seem to work fine
[19:42:14] <coldhead> i flip through the images
[19:42:16] <coldhead> good work
[19:42:42] <coldhead> do seriously consider moving this to jsfiddle so other people can mess with your code
[19:43:37] <wodemaye_> ok, but then i can't have the ajax go to a server.
[19:44:31] <coldhead> you can't at the moment because you have a syntax error
[19:45:28] <wodemaye_> ok, lemme move it over.
[19:47:10] <oojacoboo> is anyone familiar with how to pass a prototype string to a jquery function as a object?
[19:47:26] <oojacoboo> I'm not having a ton of luck here and google isn't much help either
[19:48:24] <RandalSchwartz> "prototype string"
[19:48:30] <oojacoboo> :/
[19:48:30] <RandalSchwartz> a string before there were strings? :)
[19:48:46] <oojacoboo> what would you suggest I call it?
[19:48:57] <Dr-Bombay> I don't know what you mean either
[19:49:14] <Dr-Bombay> You mean HTML markup?
[19:49:35] <oojacoboo> no, you can extend your jquery variables with functions by using prototype
[19:49:53] <oojacoboo> var foo = "blah blah"; foo.doSomething()
[19:49:57] <wodemaye_> coldhead, done: http://jsfiddle.net/XVFpr/35/
[19:50:23] <wodemaye_> i created a success() function for you to show me in if you want.
[19:51:18] <yannickoo> Hey guys
[19:51:33] <yannickoo> Can anybody tell me why the doesn't appear col by col? http://i.yannickoo.de/
[19:51:46] <yannickoo> I think the delay doesn't work $('.instabumbs a:nth-child(' + i + ')').delay(i * 1000).css('opacity', 1);
[19:51:50] <yannickoo> Line 255
[19:55:46] <wodemaye_> coldhead, see what i mean?
[19:56:36] <wodemaye_> not sure what you mean by col by col yannickoo but that's a cool site you got there.
[19:56:54] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: thanks :) it's my instagram blog
[19:57:09] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: don't wanna upload the stuff to instagram (facebook!)
[19:57:14] <RandalSchwartz> s/instagram/facebook/
[19:57:24] <yannickoo> RandalSchwartz: as i said
[19:57:45] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: i i've 31 items per row, first i wanna display the 1. image, then the 32 and so on
[19:57:51] <wodemaye_> yeah, that looks awesome, yannickoo
[19:58:00] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: the code is right but the delay doesn't work :s
[19:58:13] <wodemaye_> ahh, i see what you mean, i think.
[19:58:16] <wodemaye_> but yeah, no.  idk.
[19:58:22] <RandalSchwartz> picplz always seemed the better site than instagram
[19:58:24] <wodemaye_> how are you achieving the image slider, btw?
[19:58:28] <RandalSchwartz> not sure why instagram got all the publicity
[19:58:42] <RandalSchwartz> as in - try posting an image from the instagram website.
[19:58:46] <RandalSchwartz> oh?  no?  why not. :)
[19:59:03] <wodemaye_> meh, seemed pretty dumb to me.
[19:59:09] <coldhead> wodemaye_: http://jsfiddle.net/XVFpr/36/
[19:59:14] <RandalSchwartz> picplz works roughly the same whether you're from smartapp or web
[19:59:46] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: image slider?
[20:00:06] <yannickoo> RandalSchwartz: there isn't a cool web view for viewing instagram photos
[20:01:15] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - again proving picplz superiority
[20:01:23] <wodemaye_> yannickoo, yeah, like where you have the arrow buttons and the large central pane flips back and forth across all your pics.
[20:01:55] <yannickoo> RandalSchwartz: where is the different?
[20:01:56] <wodemaye_> coldhead, thanks dude, but can you have them be inserted to the lineup like the rest so that you could use the number buttons or whatever to rotate through them?
[20:02:09] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: it's fancybox - http://fancybox.net
[20:02:22] <coldhead> i am not going to write your project for you, no, wodemaye_ :)
[20:02:34] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://picplz.com/user/merlyn/pic/04hhz/
[20:02:43] <yannickoo> RandalSchwartz: but i like the way how i'm sharing my photos.
[20:02:57] <wodemaye_> coldhead, yeah i totally don't mind like howto links and stuff.
[20:03:09] <wodemaye_> i'm just learning but i don't know what to search on for something like that.
[20:03:32] <coldhead> wodemaye_: i would create a function addPhoto() which takes a URL and adds the numbered link and the functionality to show it. and i would probably use a template lib like the one in underscore to actually insert the html in the page
[20:03:43] <wodemaye_> i mean if you could just tell me "you need to append it to so and so div" or w/e in technical terms i can figure out how to do it..
[20:04:04] <coldhead> then i would use that function exclusively to add ALL the photos to the page
[20:04:13] <coldhead> so there's just one canonical way to do it
[20:04:21] <coldhead> and i'd use that every time
[20:04:22] <wodemaye_> yeah the ones in the static markup are just dummy placeholders.
[20:05:13] <coldhead> wodemaye_: so here's one option for the template stuff http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template
[20:06:23] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: RandalSchwartz you both cannot help me right?
[20:06:48] <coldhead> it would go something like var $newPhoto = _.template('#new-photo-template', new_image_object_via_json); $newPhoto.appendTo('#images');
[20:06:50] <RandalSchwartz> I'm still wondering what the question is. :)
[20:06:59] <coldhead> and something similar to add a new entry to the slider
[20:07:18] <coldhead> and i'd use .on() to bind all the slider elements so you can click on the nth and it will show the nth image
[20:07:42] <wodemaye_> just one second, yannickoo .
[20:09:43] <RandalSchwartz> yes.  .on() is awesome
[20:09:46] <wodemaye_> yannickoo, yeah, sorry. dono't know what to tell ya'.
[20:11:14] <chopkorn> is jquery in action a good starting point?
[20:12:24] <yannickoo> wodemaye_: why not :D
[20:12:32] <wodemaye_> coldhead, where new_image_object_via_json represents what...?
[20:12:49] <wodemaye_> the URL?
[20:13:00] <coldhead> wodemaye_: yeah, i was just future proofing
[20:13:25] <coldhead> it probably just needs something like this: {url: 'http://etc'}
[20:13:46] <coldhead> so you then your template will look like this: <img src="<% url %>" />
[20:13:55] <coldhead> but that also leaves you to extend it later to
[20:14:13] <coldhead> {url: 'http://etc}, caption: 'COME SEE MY ETCHINGS'}
[20:14:31] <coldhead> and you can add a title="<% caption %>"
[20:14:41] <coldhead> and not need to update the number of arguments to the function or anything
[20:15:17] <shoky> yannickoo your delays seem all wrong
[20:15:24] <yannickoo> shoky: why?
[20:15:33] <yannickoo> shoky: count is the right one
[20:15:33] <shoky> they have nothing to do with the 'column'
[20:15:45] <shoky> what?
[20:17:16] <yannickoo> shoky: the count
[20:17:21] <yannickoo> shoky: check line 255
[20:17:40] <wodemaye_> is there really that much of a savings in overhead to use this templating thing over simply hardcoding my one img tag with one attribute into a loop?
[20:17:50] <shoky> for example. at first i=1  so first img gets delay of 1000.  then i=32 so the second image in the first column gets a delay of 32000 ..?
[20:18:05] <shoky> that's the line i'm looking at..
[20:18:09] <yannickoo> shoky: reload pls
[20:18:21] <yannickoo> shoky: i'm using count, i increase count in every loop
[20:18:40] <shoky> yeah but the delay is i * 1000
[20:18:50] <shoky> oh
[20:18:51] <shoky> ok
[20:19:38] <shoky> it seems a
[20:19:51] <shoky> it seems a real waste to use the nth-child selector for EACH image
[20:20:23] <yannickoo> shoky: what should i use then?
[20:20:50] <shoky> also.
[20:21:03] <shoky> .css('opacity',1) isn't a queued action i think...
[20:21:19] <yannickoo> shoky: should i use .queue?
[20:21:20] <coldhead> wodemaye_: there is no performance advantage with the template, in fact it's probably slower
[20:21:34] <coldhead> it just makes your code cleaner because you take the html out of your JS
[20:21:50] <coldhead> and its a cool technique for bigger projects
[20:21:53] <coldhead> easier to grow
[20:22:12] <shoky> yannickoo, try: setTimeout( function() { $('.instabumbs a:nth-child(' + i + ')').css('opacity', 1) }, count * 1000 );
[20:22:13] <coldhead> but if you'd prefer to have a 16000 line JS file with heaps of embedded html you're in goo company
[20:22:20] <coldhead> good*
[20:23:02] <coldhead> i like to pimp underscore.js for the templating because then you have all the other underscore functions in your project for free and muahahahha
[20:23:47] <yannickoo> shoky: reload please, no items appear
[20:24:11] <shoky> it's not loading
[20:24:24] <shoky> ah
[20:24:28] <wodemaye_> coldhead, oh yeah sure, but mine's just a smallscale thing.
[20:25:30] <coldhead> sure it's small TODAY :)
[20:25:57] <coldhead> wodemaye_: see my earlier js fiddle for a not too awful way to add html to the page without templates
[20:26:11] <yannickoo> shoky: strange right
[20:26:51] <shoky> yannickoo no sorry,
[20:27:17] <shoky> yannickoo, try: var a = $('.instabumbs a:nth-child(' + i + ')');  setTimeout( function() { a.css('opacity', 1) }, count * 1000 );
[20:27:25] <shoky> but your delays are still wrong, even with count
[20:27:33] <yannickoo> shoky: why?
[20:27:42] <yannickoo> i increase it after every loop
[20:27:49] <shoky> first image gets 1000, image underneath it gets 2000
[20:27:58] <shoky> and so on
[20:28:24] <yannickoo> shoky: it's right
[20:28:48] <yannickoo> shoky: but no chance, cannot see anything
[20:30:32] <ML74> could someone help me with the scroll bar found at http://designbyml.com/washington then click Dining and Menu Name in the content?
[20:31:00] <coldhead> wodemaye_: i'm heading out, good luck to you!
[20:31:18] <yannickoo> ML74: disable the autoplay :o what's your problem?
[20:31:22] <wodemaye_> coldhead, many thanks, and have a good night!
[20:31:44] <ML74> yannickoo: i'm recreating a website (from flash to wp). not my idea lol
[20:35:12] <ML74> yannickoo: any idea?
[20:35:47] <shoky> yannickoo: try this http://pastebin.com/CJy4U7xD
[20:35:52] <shoky> instead of that whole loop
[20:35:54] <yannickoo> ML74: quelle scrollbar?
[20:36:14] <ML74> click on dining
[20:36:19] <ML74> then in the content, Menu Name
[20:36:27] <ML74> in the pop up box, there should be a scroll bar
[20:36:33] <ML74> as that table goes on for a while
[20:36:40] <ML74> scroll bar's not showing
[20:36:49] <ML74> although it works in the normal content on the page (right side)
[20:37:00] <yannickoo> shoky: oh sorry, i renamed the class, but check out the site, your old code doesn't work
[20:37:20] <shoky> then try the new code
[20:37:42] <shoky> i cant load your site 80% of the time
[20:38:19] <yannickoo> shoky: the js is wrong i guess
[20:38:36] <yannickoo> shoky: but your code doesn't do the opacity stuff :s
[20:39:05] <yannickoo> shoky: <3
[20:39:11] <yannickoo> shoky: it works better but not perfect
[20:39:29] <shoky> seems good to me
[20:39:59] <yannickoo> shoky: and how could i fade in every item by item?
[20:40:47] <shoky> just change the delay to  (i+1) * 100  for example
[20:40:59] <shoky> instead of modding it with % 31
[20:44:02] <ML74> Would there be a reason that tinyscrollbar isn't loading in a popup jquery window?
[20:44:10] <yannickoo> shoky: all items in a coloumn
[20:44:15] <yannickoo> colomn
[20:44:27] <shoky> what?
[20:44:28] <yannickoo> column :D
[20:44:38] <shoky> what about them
[20:44:41] <yannickoo> shoky: i need item by item, and col by col
[20:44:52] <shoky> not sure what that means
[20:45:14] <shoky> oh
[20:45:17] <yannickoo> shoky: first 1th picture, then the 32nd etc.
[20:45:21] <shoky> ya gotcha
[20:48:36] <yannickoo> shoky: how could we do this?
[20:48:40] <shoky> 1 sec
[20:49:49] <shoky> try: http://pastebin.com/1KBzhTuG
[20:50:44] <Wilornel> Guys, how to add text beore an input using jquery?
[20:51:05] <shoky> .before(
[20:51:25] <Wilornel> it is like .insertBefore
[20:51:29] <Wilornel> and it does not work
[20:51:44] <shoky> ?demo
[20:51:45] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:51:45] <Wilornel> oh wait a sec!
[20:52:20] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, what exactly do you mean by add text before an input?
[20:52:32] <Wilornel> I am trying to make a chatbox
[20:52:46] <Wilornel> oh great .before() works! :P
[20:53:00] <Wilornel> this is just WONDERFUL :)
[20:53:01] <LukeNukem> can i ask why you are doing it dynamically?
[20:53:07] <Wilornel> what do you mean?
[20:53:12] <Wilornel> dynamically?
[20:53:16] <yannickoo> shoky: col * 600 + row * 100  ); â€“Â why 600?
[20:53:17] <LukeNukem> why are you adding text before the input field dynamically?
[20:53:31] <Wilornel> what do you mean by dynamically?
[20:53:34] <Wilornel> its like a live chatbox
[20:53:47] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, what the text you are adding
[20:53:47] <Wilornel> as soon as one user types something, it appears on the other user's screen
[20:53:48] <shoky> yannickoo  because there are about 6 images per column, so it takes about 600 ms for one column to appear
[20:54:00] <Wilornel> I do not want to refresh the page every second
[20:54:01] <LukeNukem> oh so thats the text Wilornel ?
[20:54:06] <Wilornel> yeahhh
[20:54:08] <shoky> i guess its not perfect the way i did it but you can work with it ;p
[20:54:13] <Wilornel> ohh ok I understand what you mean ;)
[20:54:27] <Wilornel> I could just add the text when the webpage loads
[20:54:29] <LukeNukem> how do you exchange the data Wilornel?
[20:54:36] <Wilornel> uhm database
[20:54:41] <Wilornel> mysql database
[20:54:49] <LukeNukem> ajax?
[20:54:52] <Wilornel> yeah
[20:54:58] <LukeNukem> that will be uber slow for a chat
[20:55:01] <Wilornel> the jquery checks for new messages through ajax
[20:55:08] <Wilornel> what?
[20:55:13] <LukeNukem> it will be a really slow chat
[20:55:15] <Wilornel> you mean there will be a big delay right?
[20:55:18] <LukeNukem> yes
[20:55:28] <Wilornel> Then what would be a better method?
[20:55:34] <LukeNukem> realtime
[20:55:36] <LukeNukem> 3:)
[20:55:42] <LukeNukem> sockets
[20:55:44] <Wilornel> realtime?
[20:55:46] <Wilornel> sockets?
[20:55:58] <LukeNukem> wait a second, let me find an article for you
[20:56:16] <LukeNukem> what you're planning to do is polling, its bad.
[20:56:21] <Wilornel> polling?
[20:56:55] <LukeNukem> yeah
[20:56:57] <LukeNukem> google the term
[20:56:58] <Wilornel> like
[20:57:00] <Wilornel> yeah
[20:57:03] <Wilornel> I do not understand really
[20:57:09] <Wilornel> actively sampling
[20:57:32] <Wilornel> basically its making a fake realtime by constantly refreshing the page?
[20:57:39] <LukeNukem> kind of
[20:57:41] <Wilornel> or making constant requests?
[20:57:49] <LukeNukem> lets say
[20:57:53] <Wilornel> Oh I see
[20:57:55] <IconicSchema> your asking the server if updates exist constantly
[20:57:58] <LukeNukem> you will have a setInterval function to run an ajax script every X seconds
[20:58:07] <LukeNukem> which checks for new messages and updates
[20:58:08] <IconicSchema> instead of pushing updates when they do exist
[20:58:23] <Wilornel> exactly: constant requests
[20:58:36] <LukeNukem> IconicSchema, in polling the client is connected to the server in certain seconds right? where as in push he is always connected
[20:58:52] <IconicSchema> sockets allow two way communication without the overhead of http headers as well
[20:58:59] <shoky> yannickoo maybe this would fix the first columns: http://pastebin.com/CVknR9Tp
[20:59:03] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, doing this will, well kill your database
[20:59:05] <IconicSchema> yeah
[20:59:05] <LukeNukem> with hammering ;p
[20:59:29] <Wilornel> lol
[20:59:31] <LukeNukem> you can use sockets to exchange the messages but there will be no logs though
[20:59:32] <yannickoo>  shoky it's okay, i wont know how many photos there are
[20:59:37] <Wilornel> wait
[20:59:47] <Wilornel> I need to save the chat on a database
[20:59:52] <Wilornel> so that the users could see it later on
[21:00:00] <LukeNukem> well
[21:00:12] <Wilornel> is it possible with sockets?
[21:00:17] <LukeNukem> for realtime ness you exchange the messages in sockets
[21:00:24] <LukeNukem> but also store them in the database
[21:00:32] <Wilornel> oh okay
[21:00:33] <shoky> yannickoo ah
[21:00:40] <yannickoo> shoky++
[21:00:41] <Wilornel> so I can save the messages....right?
[21:00:42] <yannickoo> shoky:++
[21:00:46] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, nodejs is your thing
[21:00:48] <yannickoo> shoky++
[21:00:48] <LukeNukem> or APE server
[21:00:51] <LukeNukem> look em up
[21:00:53] <shoky> ;)
[21:01:14] <Wilornel> wow I just made a huge script for nothing :'(...
[21:01:22] <Wilornel> well thanks for telling me its not good xD
[21:01:39] <Wilornel> I'll be back
[21:01:43] <LukeNukem> nodejs not that hard relly, 12 lines is all you need :)
[21:01:58] <Wilornel> WOW :D
[21:02:14] <Wilornel> but
[21:02:20] <Wilornel> is it only for chrome?
[21:02:24] <LukeNukem> no
[21:02:26] <LukeNukem> -.-
[21:02:32] <LukeNukem> its server side js
[21:02:35] <Wilornel> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
[21:02:48] <LukeNukem> yeah its built on V8 for perfomance
[21:03:02] <Wilornel> V8
[21:03:10] <Wilornel> Where can I find documentation on that?
[21:03:17] <Wilornel> ok nvm
[21:03:22] <Wilornel> http://code.google.com/p/v8/
[21:03:34] <Dr-Bombay> platform? more like a trampoline hardy har
[21:03:35] <LukeNukem> you dont need the documentation on V8 for nodejs
[21:03:43] <Wilornel> yeah I know
[21:03:47] <shoky> heh
[21:03:47] <LukeNukem> Dr-Bombay, another nodejs hater
[21:03:48] <LukeNukem> ?
[21:03:51] <Wilornel> just wanted to get informed a bit
[21:03:53] <Dr-Bombay> you bet
[21:03:58] <Wilornel> Why would you hate nodejs?
[21:04:01] <shoky> im with bombay
[21:04:05] <shoky> not a hater. just not a liker
[21:04:08] <Wilornel> just wanted to get informed a bit
[21:04:12] <Wilornel> whoops
[21:04:16] <Wilornel> then why would you not like it?
[21:04:19] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, because its developer is "a loser whining because unix is hard"
[21:04:37] <Wilornel> these guys are on linux?
[21:04:45] <LukeNukem> you're on windows?
[21:04:48] <Wilornel> yeah
[21:04:50] <LukeNukem> :O
[21:04:52] <LukeNukem> :OO
[21:04:53] <Wilornel> lol
[21:04:58] <Wilornel> you guys on linux I see now :P
[21:05:06] <Dr-Bombay> when I feel a strong urge to start writing all my code in continuation style and adding nextTick calls as if I'm programming Windows 3.1, then maybe I'll look at nodejs
[21:05:08] <Wilornel> Well it's your tastes
[21:05:10] <LukeNukem> nodejs is a bitch on windows
[21:05:24] <Wilornel> whhaat?
[21:05:33] <LukeNukem> Dr-Bombay, how do you achieve realtime? Flash?
[21:05:37] <Wilornel> yeah
[21:05:41] <Wilornel> thats what I wanted to ask
[21:05:44] <Wilornel> shoky, you too
[21:05:46] <Wilornel> how?
[21:05:53] <Wilornel> So no nodejs for windows, right?
[21:06:05] <LukeNukem> there is, but Ryan said its not as awesome on unix
[21:06:11] <LukeNukem> its not as awesome on windows*
[21:06:12] <Dr-Bombay> wilornel: your question is word salad
[21:06:35] <Wilornel> bombay: What do you use to achieve realtime?
[21:06:36] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, you can use APE, i think it would better suit you
[21:06:42] <Wilornel> yeah I think so
[21:06:52] <LukeNukem> APE is a push engine, its solely made for this purpose
[21:07:09] <Dr-Bombay> wilornel: nodejs has nothing in particular to do with "realtime" except apparently in some made-up sense used by nodejs fans
[21:07:14] <Wilornel> It looks real good according to this video! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bFQ0ZOUQq0
[21:07:27] <Wilornel> bombay: Oh I see
[21:07:30] <Wilornel> bombay: What do you use to achieve realtime?
[21:07:39] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, realtime is just one thing you can achieve using nodejs
[21:07:46] <Wilornel> I know
[21:07:48] <Wilornel> Well
[21:07:55] <Wilornel> Thats what I understood from what bombay said
[21:08:34] <LukeNukem> its like an apache replacement
[21:08:52] <Wilornel> OHHHH OKAYYY
[21:08:55] <LukeNukem> but APE is not a web server replacement, just something meant to run alongside
[21:09:04] <Wilornel> OHH I SEEEEEEEE
[21:09:18] <Wilornel> So you can use nodejs to go to /localhost/ and stuff?
[21:09:45] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, yes, you create an http server in it
[21:09:49] <LukeNukem> and then make it listen on a port
[21:09:52] <Wilornel> Oh okayy
[21:09:58] <Wilornel> So I think I will go with ape
[21:10:08] <Dr-Bombay> wilornel, web development has no particular need for real-time guarantees (I'm using the term in its previously existing sense here.)  I am pleased to write server code on a system that includes a timeslicing scheduler.
[21:10:22] <Dr-Bombay> i.e. every other system than nodejs
[21:10:51] <LukeNukem> Dr-Bombay, he is building a chat
[21:11:05] <LukeNukem> so yeah he can long poll and use up all system resources
[21:11:10] <LukeNukem> or he can push the data
[21:11:11] <LukeNukem> :D
[21:11:23] <Wilornel> What is a timeslicing scheduler?
[21:11:35] <LukeNukem> where did you get that term
[21:11:40] <Dr-Bombay> see, that's why you are confused
[21:11:59] <Wilornel> You used that.............
[21:12:09] <Wilornel> Because of why am I confused??
[21:12:12] <LukeNukem> Dr-Bombay, did not me lol
[21:12:44] <Dr-Bombay> wilornel: it's a thing that was developed back in the 1960s so that people did not have to do crazy things like inserting nextTick calls everywhere
[21:12:45] <ML74> could someone have a look at the scrollbar problem i'm having? http://www.designbyml.com/washington. Click Dining, then Menu Name in the content. Look at source and you'll see there's content there. Scrollbar just isn't.
[21:13:09] <Wilornel> bombay: Oh I see
[21:13:22] <Wilornel> But anyways, APE looks REALLY nice! :P
[21:13:52] <LukeNukem> its a bitch setting up
[21:14:13] <Wilornel> oh my god... I can see from this webpage: http://www.ape-project.org/wiki/index.php/Setup
[21:14:44] <Wilornel> But luke
[21:14:53] <Wilornel> My chat is not ment to be like a friend chat and stuf
[21:14:59] <Wilornel> Where you spam you know
[21:15:06] <LukeNukem> multi user
[21:15:10] <LukeNukem> ?
[21:15:12] <Wilornel> Uhm
[21:15:13] <Wilornel> no
[21:15:18] <Wilornel> it is 1 vs 1
[21:15:29] <Wilornel> Its a chat where people will be talking serious stuff
[21:15:35] <LukeNukem> yeah ok
[21:15:43] <Wilornel> So there wont be things like:
[21:15:43] <Wilornel> oh
[21:15:47] <Wilornel> hi there!
[21:15:51] <Wilornel> how are you
[21:15:56] <Wilornel> and spamming like that
[21:16:13] <Wilornel> do you think that in these circumstances, the chat willh have a big delay, too?
[21:16:27] <LukeNukem> they are going to be talking, a lot of stuff maybe
[21:16:29] <LukeNukem> think about it
[21:16:39] <Wilornel> No
[21:16:43] <Wilornel> It is not a general chat
[21:16:52] <Wilornel> And most of the time, there will only be one user connected
[21:17:01] <Wilornel> He will ask a few questions
[21:17:07] <Wilornel> and then go away
[21:17:11] <LukeNukem> on form submit -> insert into database -> query db -> check for new data -> show
[21:17:20] <Wilornel> Yeah
[21:17:26] <LukeNukem> that will be a hassle
[21:17:29] <Wilornel> Wait wait
[21:17:32] <Wilornel> More like ...
[21:18:45] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2450715
[21:19:09] <Wilornel> So user1 will submit, the text will appear on his screen, it will go on the database
[21:19:25] <ML74> could someone have a look at the scrollbar problem i'm having? http://www.designbyml.com/washington. Click Dining, then Menu Name in the content. Look at source and you'll see there's content there. Scrollbar just isn't.
[21:19:26] <Wilornel> and then, the other user will have a setIntervel() of like 2 seconds which will check for new messaeges
[21:19:34] <Dr-Bombay> wilornel let me give you some unwanted advice and then be quiet: nodejs is supported by a large amount of propaganda that only works on people who have no idea what a scheduler is and what it does.
[21:19:44] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, yeah well how do you plan on exchanging that inserted data to the other users pc other than query it out from his pc on setInterval
[21:20:13] <LukeNukem> you will need something to push it
[21:20:14] <LukeNukem> mate
[21:20:17] <IconicSchema> instead of dealing with all of that you can write to an html file and refresh that
[21:20:18] <Wilornel> Yeah I know
[21:20:30] <Wilornel> But I was asking that if I do it my way, will there still be a big delay or lag?
[21:20:33] <LukeNukem> why would you want to hammer your database every 2 seconds
[21:20:36] <LukeNukem> yes
[21:20:45] <LukeNukem> imagine you have 10 users doing this
[21:20:58] <Wilornel> That is what mysql was made for...
[21:21:05] <LukeNukem> no, mysql is a database
[21:21:10] <Wilornel> yeah
[21:21:17] <LukeNukem> its not made for chat applications O_O
[21:21:18] <Wilornel> A databse which can handle lots or queries
[21:21:21] <Wilornel> lol
[21:21:26] <Wilornel> for many queries
[21:21:27] <LukeNukem> depends on the server
[21:21:46] <Wilornel> Like on the performance of the machine?
[21:22:07] <LukeNukem> yea
[21:22:42] <Wilornel> Well if it depends on the machine, no problem with that I guess
[21:22:54] <Wilornel> But I wil probably switch to APE
[21:23:27] <LukeNukem> no APE for windows
[21:23:29] <LukeNukem> :(
[21:23:33] <Wilornel> What the hell? To put APE on windows, I need to run a virtual machine!!
[21:23:37] <Wilornel> omg...
[21:23:55] <Vinc3> hi
[21:23:59] <shoky> hi
[21:23:59] <LukeNukem> advantages of being on linux \m/

[21:24:06] <Wilornel> Luke: Lol xD
[21:24:23] <Vinc3> i have a small problem with shadowbox not initializing on loaded content via jquery/ajax
[21:24:29] <LukeNukem> xD
[21:24:35] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, the shadowbox plugin?
[21:24:50] <Wilornel> Vinc3, could we see the code?

[21:28:47] <LukeNukem> yup
[21:28:52] <Wilornel> Dang
[21:29:01] <Wilornel> Since when do you code?
[21:29:09] <LukeNukem> 14
[21:29:13] <Wilornel> dahell??
[21:29:22] <Wilornel> Nahh...
[21:29:31] <LukeNukem> ?_?
[21:29:32] <bot-t> LukeNukem, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[21:29:42] <LukeNukem> dafuq
[21:29:45] <Wilornel> ?_?
[21:29:47] <bot-t> Wilornel, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[21:29:52] <Wilornel> LOL
[21:30:10] <Wilornel> So where is Vinc3's code??
[21:30:21] <Vinc3> writing explanation :-)
[21:30:36] <Wilornel> Oh okay :P
[21:30:48] <LukeNukem> you mean comments Vinc3 :P
[21:31:46] <Wilornel> Wait luke you really are 14??
[21:31:52] <Vinc3> https://gist.github.com/2451797
[21:32:31] <LukeNukem> yeah Wilornel idk why you are surprised ._.
[21:32:44] <Wilornel> Idk man you seem to know alot about jquery
[21:33:06] <LukeNukem> im more of a server side guy
[21:33:15] <Wilornel> Oh I see
[21:33:20] <Wilornel> STILL
[21:33:23] <Wilornel> Ok so vinc3
[21:33:31] <Wilornel> You want to add shadow boxes
[21:33:42] <Vinc3> obviously :-)
[21:34:07] <Vinc3> shadownbox fails to init into the new content
[21:34:31] <Vinc3> shadowbox*
[21:34:31] <Wilornel> I do not know anything about that plugin
[21:34:34] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, shadow box as in a css property
[21:34:37] <LukeNukem> or shadowbox as in the plugin
[21:34:43] <Wilornel> the plugin
[21:34:47] <Vinc3> plugin
[21:34:48] <LukeNukem> i've used it
[21:34:53] <Wilornel> what?
[21:34:53] <LukeNukem> before i wrote my own lightbox :D
[21:34:54] <Vinc3> it loads own css for cosmetics
[21:34:58] <Wilornel> You code since you are 14!
[21:35:05] <LukeNukem> yup
[21:35:15] <Vinc3> used the force well Luke
[21:35:50] <Wilornel> Oh yeah
[21:35:58] <LukeNukem> :D
[21:35:59] <Wilornel> I wanted to add a lightbox into my website, too!
[21:36:10] <Wilornel> How long did it take you to create your own?
[21:36:15] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, shadowbox works on rel='lightbox' too right?
[21:36:20] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, 2 days maybe?
[21:36:25] <Vinc3> LukeNukem, yes
[21:36:27] <LukeNukem> its really easy coming to think of it
[21:36:30] <Wilornel> In hours....
[21:36:33] <Wilornel> Oh yeah?
[21:36:40] <Vinc3> so for that matter, it seems that newly loaded content via ajax doesn't pull the initiallized stuff from the main thing
[21:37:06] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, im slow and lazy so yeah
[21:37:24] <Wilornel> Wait, luke, did you design it by yourself or did you use some tutorial?
[21:37:31] <LukeNukem> myself
[21:37:34] <Wilornel> waiit
[21:37:38] <Wilornel> using jqueru?
[21:37:40] <Wilornel> jquery*
[21:37:43] <LukeNukem> jquery, css, php.
[21:37:54] <Wilornel> Let me find some way of doing it...
[21:38:06] <LukeNukem> its really easy :D
[21:38:24] <Wilornel> I am thinking about some kind of uhm
[21:38:27] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, ill tell you the logic
[21:38:30] <Wilornel> waiit
[21:38:31] <Wilornel> waiit!
[21:38:32] <Wilornel> dont
[21:38:35] <LukeNukem> okay as you wish
[21:38:36] <Wilornel> ill explain it
[21:38:42] <Wilornel> and then you tell me if its good
[21:38:49] <Wilornel> Ok
[21:38:52] <shoky> OK
[21:38:56] <Vinc3> how to tell the parent content to use it...
[21:39:20] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, the code ;\
[21:39:21] <Wilornel> <css>#lightbox{ display: hidden; }</css>
[21:39:44] <shoky> <css> ?
[21:39:49] <Wilornel> example man!
[21:39:59] <Wilornel> html: <img src='someimage.png' />
[21:40:04] <Wilornel> jquery: sorry
[21:40:16] <Wilornel> html: <img src='someimage.png' class='someIMG' />
[21:40:31] <LukeNukem> not how i do
[21:40:37] <Wilornel> jquery: $('.someIMG').click(function(){
[21:40:46] <Wilornel> then how?
[21:40:47] <LukeNukem> Y U NO BIND ?
[21:40:51] <Wilornel> wait
[21:40:53] <Wilornel> bind??
[21:41:00] <LukeNukem> use on.click :D
[21:41:05] <shoky> why?
[21:41:10] <Wilornel> ..
[21:41:12] <Wilornel> I never use that
[21:41:18] <LukeNukem> i do a lot of dom manipulation
[21:41:20] <LukeNukem> so i use on.click
[21:41:21] <Wilornel> I don't underrstand why you need it..
[21:41:27] <LukeNukem> or i use .live
[21:41:29] <Wilornel> dom manipulation??
[21:41:31] <shoky> so
[21:41:34] <LukeNukem> but nobody likes live
[21:41:34] <oojacoboo> it's a lot of work to stay on top of all my php, css, html, design skills, and js/jq
[21:41:48] <LukeNukem> oojacoboo, out of the blue, you say that?
[21:41:49] <hyperstream> ^
[21:41:56] <hyperstream> it is.
[21:42:01] <Wilornel> luke: Why use bind???
[21:42:02] <LukeNukem> yes it is.
[21:42:11] <shoky> Wilornel: .click is fine
[21:42:20] <oojacoboo> yea, just thinking about it now that I'm messing with some jq at the momentâ€¦ I realize how I've forgotten some things when I don't use it enough
[21:42:27] <hyperstream> add some c and lame old bash
[21:42:29] <oojacoboo> like, I might go a week without touching any js
[21:42:36] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, its just something i use because when i started out i did a lot of manipulation and new elements being added to do the dom needed binding to .live or .on
[21:42:41] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, its about knowing where to access those things in your old codes :)
[21:42:41] <Vinc3> okay guys, the thing is that the shadowbox initialized on the main content but not into loaded content
[21:42:47] <LukeNukem> or so i was told in this channel so ever since i always binded
[21:42:56] <Wilornel> Luke:Whatever. What is your technique?
[21:42:57] <Vinc3> nothing to do with individual link calls
[21:42:57] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: that's not hard
[21:43:02] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, first time i write things, i add a huge comment block for future lol
[21:43:04] <shoky> you should never always do something..
[21:43:11] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, we'll use rel selectors
[21:43:18] <Wilornel> wait
[21:43:21] <Wilornel> let me check taht up
[21:43:24] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: that's not what I mean man, I mean js methods and things
[21:43:38] <Wilornel> luke :in jquery??
[21:43:43] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, all the lil bits and bobs per language :)
[21:43:48] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, yes
[21:43:56] <Vinc3> if rel="shadowbox" doesn't work then no other will, the problem is in the initialization in the loaded content :-)
[21:44:04] <oojacoboo> right, when you're doing a lot of things, it's hard to remember it all
[21:44:17] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, use another plugin
[21:44:26] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, i just get high all comes flooding back normally. But if I'm not, i get frustrated :(
[21:44:30] <Wilornel> luke: I dont find anytthing about rel selectors...
[21:44:34] <Vinc3> LukeNukem, that would be quitting
[21:44:47] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: well, that's def a bad idea
[21:44:49] <Wilornel> Vinc3: just give him the time to explain me how to do a lightbox
[21:44:52] <Vinc3> and i'm curious to solve this
[21:44:57] <oojacoboo> getting high wouldn't make me remember shit
[21:45:01] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, you basically create an element like this <a href='realimg.png'><img src='thumbnail.png' alt='watever'/></a>
[21:45:06] <Wilornel> EXACTLY
[21:45:09] <Wilornel> then?
[21:45:19] <Wilornel> waiiitt
[21:45:20] <Wilornel> what?
[21:45:25] <shoky> :\
[21:45:25] <LukeNukem> on the a element, you add a rel attribute
[21:45:33] <Wilornel> why would your a go to realimg.png?
[21:45:44] <LukeNukem> whut?
[21:45:45] <Vinc3> you two, are you kidding :-)
[21:45:51] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, depends what you REALLY know about cannabis. Sounds like you preceive it as society does. Awesome mass manipulation in the name of profits!
[21:45:59] <Wilornel> a href='realimg.png'
[21:46:01] <LukeNukem> <Wilornel> why would your a go to realimg.png? << what?
[21:46:05] <LukeNukem> yeah
[21:46:08] <Wilornel> why??
[21:46:09] <IconicSchema> here comes the debate :D
[21:46:11] <Wilornel> you have two images
[21:46:20] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: don't make assumptions, you know what that does...?
[21:46:20] <LukeNukem> the other one is a thumbnail
[21:46:23] <Wilornel> The real one and some fake one?
[21:46:27] <LukeNukem> the href leads to the big time
[21:46:28] <Wilornel> oh okay
[21:46:38] <LukeNukem> so you add a rel attribute
[21:46:40] <Vinc3> okay, let me paraphrase: how to initialize js into additionally loaded content via jquery/ajax?
[21:46:46] <Vinc3> anyone?
[21:47:05] <oojacoboo> I use to smoke a lot, and it's certainly NOT NOT good for your mind (aside from stress relief)
[21:47:09] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, so it becomes <a rel='epiclightbox' href='realimg.png'><img src='thumbnail.png' alt='watever'/></a>
[21:47:16] <shoky> it's good for my mind
[21:47:21] <LukeNukem> 420 \m/
[21:47:29] <Wilornel> 420????
[21:47:39] <oojacoboo> this wholeâ€¦ I code better on weed, think more clearly, and am better at shit all exists within your own mind
[21:47:50] <oojacoboo> it's a figment of your imagination
[21:47:50] <LukeNukem> you cant code better on weed lawl
[21:47:54] <thomedy> can i use .is in event delegation
[21:48:01] <LukeNukem> Wilornel, ok you add a rel attribute
[21:48:01] <wookiehangover> LukeNukem: false
[21:48:02] <Wilornel> sooo Luke...
[21:48:04] <Wilornel> yeah
[21:48:07] <thomedy> i want to check a div for ":hidden"
[21:48:11] <Wilornel> http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-use-various-rel-attributes-learning-microformats/16144/
[21:48:12] <LukeNukem> wookiehangover, ive tried, ive failed
[21:48:19] <thomedy> but it isn't in the dom when it loads
[21:48:19] <Wilornel> You cant have a rel name: epiclightbox
[21:48:21] <thomedy> i append it
[21:48:23] <wookiehangover> learn to use the force, luke
[21:48:25] <Wilornel> luke
[21:48:26] <Wilornel> query
[21:48:59] <shoky> thank you
[21:49:06] <thomedy> i dont know how i do it but i always kill a room
[21:50:25] <Wilornel> LOLL XD
[21:50:30] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, sorry had some memory loss bro, forgot i was talking to you :)
[21:50:36] <Wilornel> sorry dude I try to learn how to make a lightbox
[21:50:52] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: what were you saying?
[21:50:59] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, stop smoking !
[21:51:01] <oojacoboo> aside from how you're superman on weed?
[21:51:25] <hyperstream> now thats funny.
[21:51:43] <shoky> just cause weed made you too paranoid it doesn't mean others cant/shouldn't enjoy it ;P
[21:52:05] <oojacoboo> shoky: enjoy it all you want, I'm all for it
[21:52:09] <hyperstream> billions of recepters and only one thing on this planet which triggers it ^_^
[21:52:14] <oojacoboo> just don't claim it makes you smarter at all
[21:52:17] <oojacoboo> b/c it does the opposite
[21:52:19] <shoky> smarter? of course not
[21:52:23] <shoky> but it does help me focus
[21:52:29] <oojacoboo> shoky: no it doesn't
[21:52:31] <oojacoboo> that's a lie
[21:52:35] <shoky> right cause like, yer in my head
[21:52:39] <oojacoboo> right
[21:52:59] <hyperstream> shoky, he is under the control of the system! can't help the robots bro lol
[21:53:11] <shoky> hokay
[21:53:30] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: only Yoshimi
[21:53:48] <hyperstream> Which is ?
[21:53:50] <oojacoboo> don't forget that
[21:54:06] <oojacoboo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK6lxIqzk04
[21:54:39] <hyperstream> man video's are not stimulating when smashed.
[21:54:46] <hyperstream> trying to put me to sleep!
[21:54:56] <oojacoboo> learn something stoner
[21:55:12] * hyperstream pats oojacoboo 
[21:55:37] <hyperstream> Crank some bob bro, lots to learn right there
[21:56:37] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: get up stand up, fight for your right
[21:57:05] <Vinc3> hmm... thinking of calling .load function to pull the content into container and then call the shadowbox plugin
[21:57:09] <hyperstream> err.. listen to it again bru
[21:59:02] <thomedy> i really have no idea what to do
[21:59:29] <oojacoboo> thomedy: toke a fatty
[21:59:36] <oojacoboo> it'll come to you
[21:59:38] <hyperstream> lawl
[21:59:58] <oojacoboo> blaze one down bro
[22:00:03] <hyperstream> chur brother
[22:00:42] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: I like taking bong rips on the shitter
[22:01:05] <oojacoboo> it makes it much more enjoyable
[22:02:13] <thomedy> i just came up with an idea lets see if this works
[22:02:37] <thomedy> does javascript have a stack the way c++ can make a stack
[22:02:41] <thomedy> push, pop kinda thing
[22:02:53] <thomedy> whatever i can use an array
[22:03:07] <hyperstream> oojacoboo, I'm a kiwi, so i use hot knives for mine. More of a head buzz compared to bongs/buckets/joints. Idea is to boil the THC out and nothing out on the plant, kinda like a poor mans vap
[22:03:32] <hyperstream> thomedy, what are you trying to achieve bud ?
[22:05:36] <LukeNukem> we still talking about weed ?
[22:06:02] <oojacoboo> hyperstream: is talking about how he makes his own crack pipes
[22:06:26] <hyperstream> LukeNukem, I think oojacoboo is butt hurt. Its ok - if everyone just leaves him be, it'll resolve itself
[22:06:27] <LukeNukem> i just make a joint in beedi
[22:06:41] <LukeNukem> crack pipes?
[22:06:42] <LukeNukem> :\
[22:06:49] <LukeNukem> fuck crack, ganja ftw!
[22:06:53] <hyperstream> ^_^
[22:07:33] <shoky> thomedy yea an array
[22:09:21] <hyperstream> Kia Kaha :)
[22:10:15] <oojacoboo> anyone tried something like this before?  find("input.amountDue:last").is(":disabled")
[22:10:20] <oojacoboo> I'm having issues with it working
[22:11:23] <wodemaye_> can i select '#superel .class' for all elements of class 'class' that are children of the element of id 'superel'?
[22:11:45] <oojacoboo> wodemaye_: yes
[22:13:31] <Vinc3> ofcourse you can wodemaye_ ... you can do anything
[22:14:03] <wodemaye_> :)
[22:14:34] <Vinc3> LukeNukem, i saw bragging and all, but you didn't help an inch, nada
[22:15:22] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, :\
[22:15:25] <wodemaye_> Vinc3, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9gAqvttwq8
[22:15:30] <Vinc3> well, ajax-loaded content and keeping js inits is something i've never worked with
[22:15:46] <LukeNukem> i was on query with Wilornel
[22:15:49] <Vinc3> yeah nice groove
[22:16:00] <LukeNukem> and you never sent me a pastie :|
[22:16:01] <Vinc3> i never needed that thing before
[22:16:45] <Vinc3> but how in general can i keep all inits to be valid for external ajaxed content as well?
[22:16:58] <tman> what is a .jp file?
[22:17:08] <tman> there's a script tag referencing a er.. .gp
[22:17:16] <Vinc3> i just need answer on that question, i'll figure out the rest
[22:17:25] <oojacoboo> Vinc3: can you please rephrase that
[22:17:29] <Vinc3> .jp is a domain for japan though :-)
[22:17:35] <tman> .gp
[22:17:53] <tman> Geode parameter file (Geoworks Glue
[22:18:30] <Vinc3> oojacoboo, i cannot be more clear
[22:18:40] <oojacoboo> Vinc3: I cannot answer then, g/l
[22:19:46] <Vinc3> i don't want to have javascript in dynamic loaded content
[22:20:09] <oojacoboo> you shouldn't
[22:20:20] <oojacoboo> you should include your js files in the head of your site
[22:20:38] <oojacoboo> only load the ones you need for that page really
[22:20:41] <Vinc3> some scripts don't want to initialize on loaded content
[22:20:48] <oojacoboo> ??
[22:21:04] <Vinc3> like this shadowbox
[22:21:10] <oojacoboo> Vinc3: you're not making a lot of sense
[22:21:31] <LukeNukem> https://gist.github.com/2451797
[22:21:32] <oojacoboo> and the terminology you're using isn't really all that correct, it's very generic
[22:21:36] <LukeNukem> does not help me help you
[22:21:43] <LukeNukem> so what you said is stupid
[22:22:14] <Vinc3> well, i am not a coder
[22:22:18] <Vinc3> nor programmer
[22:22:20] <Vinc3> etc
[22:22:23] <LukeNukem> then what are you doing here?
[22:22:52] <IconicSchema> Hey hey, guy was just asking a question.
[22:22:56] <Vinc3> trying to make shadowbox working on loaded content :-)
[22:23:08] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, you have code, you're asking for help
[22:23:13] <LukeNukem> you're here
[22:23:14] <oojacoboo> Vinc3: load all dependencies in the head
[22:23:14] <LukeNukem> you're a coder
[22:23:34] <LukeNukem> oh and put them js between <head></head>
[22:23:42] <tman> does someone have a sec to go to http://tman.ca/mobile-test (resize the window to like <680 ) and tell me if the directions are accurate to where they are?
[22:23:50] <tman> seems to be working..
[22:23:53] <Vinc3> LukeNukem, ofcourse i did that
[22:24:04] <LukeNukem> what exactly is the issue
[22:24:09] <IconicSchema> He's asking how to init "shadowbox" on ajax content
[22:24:16] <LukeNukem> hmm
[22:24:22] <Vinc3> it fails to intit on ajax-loaded content, it works well on main page
[22:24:25] <Vinc3> init*
[22:24:27] <LukeNukem> initiating it once isn't enough for the ajax content too?
[22:24:37] <Vinc3> nope
[22:24:40] <oojacoboo> Vinc3: maybe you need to bind it
[22:24:41] <IconicSchema> Vinc3: Add a callback to your ajax
[22:24:51] <Vinc3> oojacoboo, YES!
[22:24:56] <Vinc3> how to do that??
[22:25:03] <oojacoboo> jquery on()
[22:25:05] <LukeNukem> maybe initiate it dynamically?
[22:25:05] <oojacoboo> google it
[22:25:08] <IconicSchema> depends on the function
[22:25:08] <Vinc3> oh great
[22:25:15] <Vinc3> now this is some help :-)
[22:25:25] <IconicSchema> oojacoboo: and what event do you suppose he binds to?
[22:25:32] <LukeNukem> ^
[22:25:35] <oojacoboo> IconicSchema: I have no idea what he's doing
[22:25:42] <oojacoboo> so I can't say
[22:25:45] <Vinc3> rel="shadowbox"
[22:25:50] <LukeNukem> ^thats not an event
[22:25:52] <LukeNukem> its an attribute
[22:26:07] <IconicSchema> Vinc3: the best way to do it is to add a callback to your ajax call
[22:26:14] <shoky> Vinc3: do what IconicSchema said. call the plugin function from the ajax callback
[22:27:20] <LukeNukem> this might sound whacky but load content via ajax, get the images link from it. Append a shadowbox element to the current page
[22:27:31] <LukeNukem> using $('body').append
[22:27:40] <Vinc3> okay
[22:27:46] <LukeNukem> in the success callback that is
[22:30:12] <Vinc3> so in this case i call shadowbox function directly from the ajax callback, right?
[22:30:31] <LukeNukem> yup
[22:34:40] <Vinc3> man this is dirty trick!
[22:34:43] <Vinc3> it works
[22:35:27] <Vinc3> i have no idea what i just did but it works
[22:35:29] <Vinc3> :-)
[22:35:36] <LukeNukem> show code please
[22:38:39] <LukeNukem> Vinc3, code?
[22:38:48] <Vinc3> wait
[22:42:03] <Vinc3> it does work only first time
[22:42:13] <Vinc3> but on next load it stops
[22:42:21] <Vinc3> argh
[22:50:10] <wodemaye_> name = "barack"; name+="babybomber"; name+="hussein"; should work right?
[22:50:29] <wodemaye_> += is the concat operator, right?
[22:50:35] <coldhead> si
[22:51:17] <coldhead> ?eval name = "barack"; name+="babybomber"; name+="hussein"; name;
[22:51:18] <bot-t> coldhead: "barackbabybomberhussein"
[22:51:23] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[22:51:23] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:51:44] <coldhead> ?eval ['thing','lol','aids'].join(' ')
[22:51:45] <bot-t> coldhead: "thing lol aids"
[22:51:57] <LukeNukem>  iknow bot-t i know
[22:52:15] <LukeNukem> thank you bot-t
[22:52:16] * bot-t sighs
[22:52:22] <LukeNukem> thanks bot-t
[22:52:22] <bot-t> LukeNukem, I'm a bot you know..
[22:53:34] <wodemaye_> oh hey, coldhead you're back!
[22:54:11] <coldhead> back but distracted, it won't count for much
[22:56:00] <wodemaye_> why does http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/41/ work, but not: http://jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/3/ anyone?
[22:56:23] <wodemaye_> its so weird: i've literally copied and pasted each piece of code from one to the other completely verbatim.
[22:56:32] <wodemaye_> refreshed each bypassing browwser cache and everything.
[22:57:21] <tman> does anyone know how to yank this soundbyte without having pipe the output to another device and record it?
[22:57:21] <tman> http://www.mobiles24.com/mediaplayer/mp3preview.swf?loc=1&id=65627&h=1410981
[22:57:30] <tman> i wanna use it as my sms sound.
[22:57:33] <tman> <- dota fan.
[22:57:56] <tman> i've extracted that outta the actual page it's on.. they want me to register to dl it, and i hate doing that.
[22:58:14] <wodemaye_> tman just a sec.
[22:58:19] <tman> kk :)
[22:58:48] <coldhead> wodemaye_: your second example, in the pane at left where you can "Choose framework"
[22:58:56] <coldhead> you have mootools, not jQuery
[22:59:16] <wodemaye_> coldhead, ahh.
[22:59:37] <tman> i tried to dl the page directly but without the query it just grabs the playback controller
[22:59:43] <tman> and not the actual soundbyte.
[23:00:10] <wodemaye_> tman got me stumped dude, i can't find a sound file link and i ran strings on it.
[23:00:17] <tman> blast
[23:00:20] <tman> i did that too
[23:00:27] <wodemaye_> what's the embed code they use on the main html page source?
[23:00:28] <tman> i scanned the js files too
[23:00:38] <tman> sec
[23:00:45] <wodemaye_> cus i'll be that's just the player in the bin
[23:00:58] <tman> http://dpaste.com/735433/
[23:01:16] <tman> sorry about the decoded content.
[23:01:34] <tman> oh well i don't care THAT much
[23:01:37] <tman> just wish i was smarter.
[23:01:39] * tman sighs.
[23:01:57] <tman> apparently tman is not godlike :P
[23:02:59] <wodemaye_> dude, you're a frickin' genuis, coldhead
[23:04:24] <coldhead> you're too kind, i can barely tie my own shoes
[23:04:37] <coldhead> velcro can change your life, people
[23:05:06] <wodemaye_> lol
[23:06:04] <wodemaye_> tman: can you believe they're fuckin' trying to put DRM into browsers now?
[23:06:22] <wodemaye_> NPAPI stuff aside, even?
[23:07:44] <wodemaye_> jesus christ tman shockwave is such a POS
[23:07:48] <wodemaye_> got me stumped.
[23:08:58] <tman> don't worry
[23:09:00] <tman> flash has had it's time
[23:09:06] <tman> <5 years it's gone.
[23:09:28] <tman> esp with things like canvas, css3, and jquery of course.
[23:09:41] <tman> like super fringe sites will still use it
[23:09:57] <tman> for crazy over priced movie bugets
[23:10:02] <tman> that make use of things like papervision
[23:10:08] <tman> but otherwise, screw flash.
[23:11:15] <coldhead> check out this teaser for the new alien movie though http://weyland.com/
[23:11:19] <coldhead> html5 goodness
[23:11:24] <coldhead> hollywood is catching on
[23:11:35] <coldhead> i bet its only restaurant sites that will still be flash
[23:11:53] <coldhead> because the goodness of the food is dependent on the flashness of their web site, apparently
[23:12:18] <coldhead> lol this is the site i meant https://www.weylandindustries.com/investor
[23:12:20] <coldhead> me so sorry
[23:12:30] <wodemaye_> functionally, why is there nay difference between 10 and 11? jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/10/ jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/11/
[23:12:54] <wodemaye_> coldhead, that and bands.
[23:13:10] <coldhead> eh the best bands are on bandcamp anyway :P
[23:13:47] <wodemaye_> coldhead, true dat.
[23:13:50] <tman> things like concrete5 or codeigniter are great for restuarant sites
[23:13:57] <tman> just they typically don't have budgets
[23:14:00] <tman> from my exp.
[23:14:16] <tman> everybody wants to do everything in WP
[23:14:17] <tman> UGGGH
[23:14:37] <wodemaye_> tman, yeah i know.
[23:14:48] <coldhead> the only difference i see is that you're setting the image width
[23:14:53] <wodemaye_> and height.
[23:14:58] <coldhead> yes
[23:15:02] <wodemaye_> but i'm doing it in a class when i don't do it inline.
[23:15:08] <wodemaye_> which should be fine - better even.
[23:15:16] <coldhead> oh okay
[23:15:17] <wodemaye_> but it wrecks it.
[23:15:25] <coldhead> css width/height is not the same as width= and height=
[23:15:36] <coldhead> what i usually do is set the width in css
[23:15:38] <coldhead> or the height
[23:15:46] <coldhead> and it will automatically scale
[23:16:05] <coldhead> and if you're paranoid you can do width: 256px; max-height: 256px;
[23:16:06] <wodemaye_> why aren't they the same, coldhead ?
[23:16:22] <coldhead> i can't really remember
[23:16:27] <coldhead> i just never use the html style anymore
[23:16:36] <coldhead> its all about the css these days
[23:16:44] <wodemaye_> yeah i know which is why i'm trying to set it.
[23:16:55] <wodemaye_> i got the jq code from an online tutorial.
[23:16:59] <coldhead> right so forget the html version
[23:17:08] <coldhead> we fix the css version and you're happy, right?
[23:17:30] <wodemaye_> coldhead, yeah, but i've made other mods to it by now sso just tell me what to add to css.
[23:17:36] <wodemaye_> ideally i'd have no presentation inline.
[23:17:56] <coldhead> that's the spirit
[23:18:03] <coldhead> what do you need the css to do?
[23:18:24] <coldhead> i would assume you want the image centered?
[23:18:39] <coldhead> i will do you a small demo
[23:18:59] <wodemaye_> coldhead, i want it to be visually the same as the nonbroken one
[23:20:30] <wodemaye_> http://jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/12/ there, just pull the inline style out into the stylesheet on that one.
[23:21:58] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/2aUV3/
[23:22:07] <coldhead> that's how i would do what i think you're trying to do
[23:23:08] <wodemaye_> no, cus i like them all to be uniform size
[23:23:15] <wodemaye_> and for none to have any margin/border.
[23:23:38] <thomedy> i dont think i understand jquery the way i thought i did
[23:23:59] <thomedy> i cant pass a variabel by reference can i
[23:25:04] <coldhead> err, not usually
[23:25:09] <coldhead> except with arrays, obviously
[23:25:21] <coldhead> although we don't like to talk about that
[23:25:27] <coldhead> it's better to have it cause a bug
[23:25:30] <coldhead> and make you freak out
[23:25:32] <coldhead> and then remember
[23:25:39] <coldhead> and then be too ashamed to tell anyone
[23:25:40] <thomedy> i have a variabel that i have created just inside of doc ready
[23:25:42] <coldhead> stupid arrays
[23:25:53] <thomedy> and then in a  click event i create divs
[23:25:55] <thomedy> with .append
[23:26:04] <thomedy> so after that click event i have a .live
[23:26:23] <thomedy> in there i check for a specific element i have appended among other things
[23:26:28] <coldhead> wodemaye_: http://jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/14/ ?
[23:26:30] <thomedy> but there are 2 lives
[23:26:51] <thomedy> the variabel left-click and right -click die  inside those click events
[23:26:57] <thomedy> i can give the url and pastebin if it will help
[23:27:03] <thomedy> but its giving me fits
[23:27:25] <thomedy> like i just want to reset my count
[23:27:57] <coldhead> show us the coads, thomedy
[23:28:27] <thomedy> sorry im tired i actuallly fell asleep jus tnow... my sentence could have been followed by .. zzzzz
[23:28:30] <thomedy> ill get it right now
[23:28:37] <thomedy> first off
[23:28:42] <coldhead> i suspect this isn't going to go well
[23:28:44] <wodemaye_> still not great for the signing and monticello.
[23:28:46] <wodemaye_> coldhead,
[23:28:53] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[23:28:56] <wodemaye_> but certainly better.
[23:29:32] <coldhead> wodemaye_: i think what you need is a portrait class and a landscape class
[23:29:35] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/9rbkTgUW
[23:29:41] <thomedy> okay pastebin and url
[23:30:00] <wodemaye_> coldhead, hate to say it but maybe i'll just keep with the inline w/h
[23:30:01] <coldhead> .portrait {max-width:256px;} .landscape {max-height:256px}
[23:30:07] <thomedy> the load time is slow because now i check for a bunch of images i hide with css to get the source but im going to change that to decrease the load time
[23:30:25] <coldhead> and then you test whether each image is portrait or landscape as you add it
[23:30:42] <coldhead> inline sizes might work but it's not the future and in 10 years some kid will hate you
[23:32:05] <coldhead> thomedy: it looks like these counters are within the scope of the two live functions
[23:32:11] <coldhead> so they should be able to mess with it
[23:32:24] <thomedy> right because i need the counter when i move left or right
[23:32:29] <thomedy> if you have a suggestion im open to it
[23:32:52] <coldhead> i still don't understand the problem
[23:32:58] <coldhead> i am trying the demo now
[23:33:25] <thomedy> do you have firebug
[23:33:35] <coldhead> hmm, your demo is upset because it's trying to evaluate some CSS as JS
[23:33:43] <coldhead> designer_list,css
[23:33:50] <coldhead> that's probably not related but wtf
[23:34:00] <coldhead> yes of course i have debuggers, thomedy
[23:34:05] <coldhead> i;m a web professional
[23:34:34] <thomedy> i thought so go to console
[23:34:42] <thomedy> i logged my tests
[23:34:45] <coldhead> see
[23:34:48] <coldhead> i mean
[23:34:48] <coldhead> si*
[23:34:53] <coldhead> i see all the debug output
[23:35:03] <coldhead> i do carousels in a very different way
[23:35:12] <coldhead> i have a fixed size viewport
[23:35:22] <coldhead> and that contains a div of width:auto
[23:35:30] <coldhead> which holds all the elems
[23:35:35] <coldhead> there can be any number
[23:35:41] <coldhead> so the width can vary
[23:35:42] <thomedy> i have no idea what im doing honestly im just learnin on the job
[23:35:43] <coldhead> i don't care
[23:35:51] <coldhead> then to do the scroll
[23:35:51] <thomedy> kinda thing
[23:35:57] <coldhead> i animate scrollLeft
[23:36:13] <coldhead> and when the scrollLeft >= the width of the thing i am scrolling
[23:36:15] <coldhead> then i am at the end
[23:36:18] <thomedy> but except for that counter it works fine
[23:36:30] <coldhead> i am not seeing what doesn't work fine
[23:36:44] <coldhead> the arrow seems to disappear when i get to the end
[23:36:48] <coldhead> and reappears when i go back
[23:36:49] <thomedy> okay if you click another imgage at the right
[23:37:03] <thomedy> and then follow the right and left buttons youll see that it
[23:37:11] <thomedy> goes beyond the slideshow to white space]
[23:37:16] <thomedy> because the counter doesn't reset
[23:37:22] <coldhead> ah
[23:37:24] <coldhead> okay
[23:38:30] <wodemaye_> coldhead, can you mention my nick in 5 seconds? i'm trying to test my client's notification.  thx.
[23:38:57] <thomedy> if i can reset the counter all my troubles are solved i think
[23:39:51] <coldhead> wodemaye_: like this?
[23:40:00] <wodemaye_> coldhead, yup.
[23:40:06] <coldhead> thomedy: what i don't get is it doesn't fuck up every time
[23:40:47] <coldhead> thomedy: i stilll don't fully grasp all your code BUT my feeling is where you compare the counter - 2 === 0
[23:40:56] <coldhead> i would try counter - 2 <= 0
[23:41:06] <coldhead> in case something has gone wrong and the counter is -1
[23:41:31] <coldhead> you want to catch 0 or less, not just zero, right?
[23:41:43] <thomedy> yes
[23:44:22] <thomedy> excuse me i have to put my son to sleep and thank you but that wasnt quite right ... brb
[23:45:48] <thomedy> i just gotta figure out how to reset the counter it works the first time every time
[23:51:00] <coldhead> i guess i don't understnad the problem because it seems to be behaving correctly to me now
[23:53:05] <thomedy> okay let me try again maybe i fixed it
[23:54:36] <thomedy> not quite yet
[23:55:22] <thomedy> is there a issue with using namespaces or gloval 'window.'
[23:55:29] <thomedy> global
[23:56:33] <coldhead> not that i know of
[23:56:50] <coldhead> are you sure you're not seeing a cache problem?
[23:56:55] <coldhead> i can scroll any amount to the right
[23:56:58] <coldhead> and when i go back left
[23:57:01] <coldhead> when i reach the first one
[23:57:05] <coldhead> the arrow disappears
[23:57:06] <coldhead> no whitespace
[23:57:10] <coldhead> it feels good man
[23:58:17] <thomedy> maybe let me cache and try againe 1 sec my son is sleepin in my armsmaking it real hard to type
[23:58:44] <coldhead> i gotta go attend to some paperwork, i'll check in later
