[03:42:08] <Brousse> Hi, i use some ajax to update table rows every 10 seconds, and i would like rows to do a fadeOut() fadeIn() effect when updated. But i would like to do it 1 row at a time, i tried with settimeout and other functions but i can't have the result i want... my code looks like this: http://pastebin.com/54eD4dnL
[03:43:19] <Brousse> i think fadein/out use settimeout and both function block the UI

[12:55:41] <zilberstein> It works

[14:10:03] <jak2000> hi all
[14:10:28] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ogh9kcw2/1/   <--- why if press the button say me the value 1? it would be, 501, 502, 503 .....
[14:10:31] <jak2000> how to fix it?
[14:14:52] <Woet> jak2000: because you have multiple .clseltipmov elements, it picks the first one.
[14:18:20] <Duikb00t> o/
[14:18:37] <jak2000> but si you see the first element was hidden
[14:18:43] <jak2000> can you see? thanks
[14:19:39] <Woet> jak2000: thats irrelevant.
[14:20:06] <jak2000> mmm any idea how to fix?
[14:20:48] <Woet> jak2000: give your elements unique ids.
[14:21:36] <jak2000> HAVE UNIQUE IDS....
[14:21:40] <jak2000> sorry for the caps
[14:21:58] <jak2000> the user can hide an unhide select/option......
[14:22:13] <jak2000> with different values
[14:22:27] <Duikb00t> When I console.log this:  "  $('.menu_detail:eq(' + clickedID + ')')  "
[14:22:29] <jak2000> or... is possible hide a <option> ?
[14:22:35] <Duikb00t> how can I Get the HTML element in there?
[14:22:39] <Duikb00t> So i see the full line
[14:22:40] <Woet> jak2000: hiding wont change the jquery selector.
[14:23:08] <Woet> Duikb00t: .html()?
[14:23:43] <Duikb00t> Undefined
[14:23:46] <Duikb00t> :(
[14:24:09] <Woet> Duikb00t: what kind of element is it? are you sure your selector is working?
[14:25:30] <jak2000> woet can i hide a <option> element?
[14:25:33] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/GaP7X  Maybe something is wrong
[14:25:42] <Woet> jak2000: yes, and again, hiding wont change the jquery selector.
[14:25:42] <jak2000> have 10 options hide 2 and the user only see 8? is possible?
[14:25:46] <Woet> jak2000: yes.
[14:26:06] <Woet> Duikb00t: www.jsfiddle.net
[14:26:06] <Woet> Duikb00t: working demo please.
[14:26:07] <jak2000> Woet k try
[14:28:20] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/b9frzd2c/
[14:28:26] <Duikb00t> line 25 in the javascript
[14:28:31] <Duikb00t> I have all menu boxes on line 18
[14:28:39] <Duikb00t> You can select on the <a> a menu. Then submenu's appear in the ul list items
[14:28:48] <Duikb00t> you can select a submenu by clickin gon it  ( line 25)
[14:28:58] <Duikb00t> I would now like to show the right menu
[14:30:16] <Woet> Duikb00t: theres nothing with the class menu_picker, so i cant replicate it.
[14:30:46] <Duikb00t> ohrealy
[14:32:04] <Duikb00t> Is this one better?
[14:32:04] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/b9frzd2c/2/
[14:33:01] <Woet> Duikb00t: what am I supposed to do to replicate it?
[14:33:55] <Duikb00t> bah im so confused : I know whats wrong
[14:34:27] <Woet> Duikb00t: you know you can just use $(this) right?
[14:35:48] <Duikb00t> Woet:  I think you can help me :D haha what's the right way of going 2 elements up in the dom?
[14:35:52] <Duikb00t> next(); was going down?
[14:35:57] <Duikb00t> find(); ?
[14:36:02] <Woet> Duikb00t: .parent()
[14:36:20] <Duikb00t> can I do that just twice?
[14:36:54] <Duikb00t> or is writing console.log($(this).parent().parent()); fair enough? ( Which works )
[14:37:45] <Woet> Duikb00t: you can use .parents with a selector or with .eq
[14:37:48] <Duikb00t> console.log($(this).parent().parent().data('menuid', menuid));
[14:37:50] <Duikb00t> is what I now have
[14:38:27] <Woet> ok.
[14:38:31] <Duikb00t> <div class="menu_detail container-fluid" data-menuid="2"
[14:38:35] <Duikb00t> I want to grab that 2
[14:38:48] <Woet> alright
[14:39:03] <Duikb00t> So probably something like this
[14:39:04] <Duikb00t> should do it
[14:39:06] <Duikb00t> console.log($(this).parent().parent().data('menuid'));
[14:40:37] <Duikb00t> Ok that works but now the last and most tricky part imo.
[14:41:10] <Duikb00t> I have to show a div with the clicked data-id
[14:41:26] <Duikb00t> Inside this variable $currentMenu = $(this).parent().parent().data('menuid');
[14:42:43] <Duikb00t> think I have an idea
[14:44:18] <Duikb00t> See Woet Im almost there
[14:45:08] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/F4cgm  if you have an idea you probably see it immedialty
[14:45:22] <Duikb00t> I tried this: console.log($(this).data('submenuid'));  but got undefined.
[14:50:26] <Duikb00t> This works:       console.log($(e.target).data('submenuid'));
[15:01:18] <Duikb00t> Woet:  Still around
[15:01:19] <Duikb00t> ?
[15:39:50] <hassoon> is that anonymous function called during page load or what ? http://paste.debian.net/916786/

[15:42:52] <snfgf> hello
[15:42:54] <snfgf> http://pastebin.com/xyKvXRU2
[15:42:59] <snfgf> this isn't working for me
[15:43:07] <snfgf> the console.log says $ is undefined
[15:43:29] <snfgf> but the Network Tab of Dev Tools actually shows that jquery-3.1.1.js has been loaded?
[15:54:09] <juinn> robert
[15:57:53] <cannap> snfgf, why you need to add scrip0ts like this?
[15:58:06] <snfgf> cannap, in case a CDN link fails
[15:58:16] <cannap> this is the wrong wai..
[15:58:17] <cannap> way
[15:58:22] <snfgf> https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CDNsFailButYourScriptsDontHaveToFallbackFromCDNToLocalJQuery.aspx
[15:58:29] <snfgf> what is the right way?
[15:58:43] <snfgf> i basically used the top example from that page
[15:58:52] <cannap> just include the jquery
[15:58:56] <cannap> and the no problem
[15:58:59] <cannap> then
[15:59:22] <snfgf> just include it? you mean like, <script src="js/jquery.js"></script> or some other way?
[15:59:28] <cannap> when cdn fails is a problem when your website fails is a problem
[15:59:41] <cannap> yea as example
[16:00:02] <cannap> and you use cdn in a wrong way
[16:00:07] <snfgf> but what if I want to use a CDN? if I include it after that, I'm loading the same script twice
[16:00:51] <cannap> you should just include <script src="/linktojquery"> </script> before you close the </body> tag
[16:01:10] <snfgf> And not use a CDN for jQuery at all?
[16:01:18] <cannap> you can use cdn
[16:01:30] <cannap> but dont write the script shit tag via js itself
[16:02:19] <snfgf> Okay. That wasn't all the code, my mistake
[16:02:20] <snfgf> http://pastebin.com/RYrJcuej
[16:03:24] <snfgf> so basically, I want to load the local file if the CDN fails. BUT, document.write appends to the end of the <body>, as the last script, meaning jQuery will load after the stuff that depends on it
[16:03:34] <cannap> its this stuff sync=
[16:03:43] <cannap> not sure thie is async
[16:04:09] <cannap> with a async i mean the code do not wait
[16:04:34] <cannap> and do not execute before jquery is ready
[16:05:09] <cannap> no damn  my english i mean the code does not wait before jquery is finished dowloadded
[16:05:41] <cannap> and then you try to execute some stuff but jquery is not ready
[16:06:24] <snfgf> I'm not using async
[16:42:11] <snfgf> Hmm.
[17:46:49] <d2k> hi, I have a very basic question: Would writing a number ever second into the console cause performance issues, affecting e.g. frame rate or something else?
[17:57:22] <d2k> never mind, I changed the interval to minutes while also setting seconds instead of miliseconds. Works :)
