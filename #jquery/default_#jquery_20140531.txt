[00:30:30] <wa5ted_> im doing not so great
[00:30:37] <wa5ted_> vignelli apssed away  :(
[00:57:01] <Yahkob> lol i just imagine simbalion being some kids dad
[00:57:19] <Yahkob> "Youre what those stoner kids would call a buzz kill see im pretty cool i know your terms"
[00:58:42] <jop008> I have a form and php code on the same page when a user selects something I want to send it to the server I tried with post but no luck
[00:58:57] <jop008> Send it by ajax post in several ways
[01:28:59] <latemus> ok. i have a form, which uses some js hide and show a few sections, so the user can step through the form by clicking a "next button" with onclick. I'm using jquery.validate on the form via the submit button at the final step. I want the form in chunks; one step of of the form at a time, useng the "next" button and onclick, rather than all at once via the submit button at the end
[01:29:33] <latemus> * i'm trying to validate the form one step at a time
[01:33:20] <latemus> is there a way to somehow group certain elements within the form, and validate them in smaller groups using an onclick event or something? at the moment i'm trying to acheive that effect by using a submitHandler or onclickHandler
[01:33:44] <latemus> (if the latter even exists)
[01:35:06] <latemus> according to the jquery plugins forum group: cant really be used for that purpose
[01:35:39] <Cagelin> latemus: I think you'll have to do that yourself. I'd suggest using a data-attribute on your group containers and check if they're used or not during the validation
[01:41:06] <latemus> Cagelin: do you mean do it myself in pure js or jquery
[01:41:44] <Cagelin> you can do it in jquery
[01:41:55] <Cagelin> the user has to click on something to show/hide the form groups right?
[01:43:05] <latemus> yeah
[01:43:38] <Cagelin> yeah, so you keep track on which groups are active either by adding a data-attribute or adding a class to the form group (the fieldset or div containing the form elements)
[01:43:56] <Cagelin> then in your submit function, you iterate over those elements, only sending the data the user filled in to the server
[01:46:58] <latemus> Cagelin: sweet. thanks for the suggestion!
[01:47:07] <latemus> thats great
[01:50:19] <latemus> if i want to decouple the actual submission of the form from the validation of it.. that can be done in the submit function, yeah?
[01:50:36] <latemus> i'll play with it. thanks agin
[01:51:58] <Cagelin> yeah latemus
[01:52:04] <latemus> :)
[01:52:06] <Cagelin> the easiest way is to apply a class to the subforms
[01:52:09] <Cagelin> then in your submit function
[01:52:25] <Cagelin> try something like $(this).find(".your-group-class input").serialize()
[01:52:28] <latemus> and use tho class to hide/display
[01:52:30] <Cagelin> you'll get the idea :P
[01:52:58] <latemus> Awesome
[02:32:08] <ussher_> I got some data come in in json format.  I want to display some of it and keep some until the form is submitted.  Where is the normal way to do that?  write it to a hidden element on the page?  set it in the session? other?

[03:10:59] <fas3r> oki
[03:11:28] <fas3r> Kambfhase: thank you
[03:11:33] <Kambfhase> np
[03:12:38] <fas3r> and is it possible to put something like : $(this).find('tr:first td:first td:last ')       ---   like to specify the range ?   or in that case I can just put $(this).find('tr:first td:last')  and jquery will take the first TD to the last TD ?
[03:12:47] <fas3r> (last TD a limit)
[03:18:02] <Kambfhase> fas3r: You could do $(this).find('tr:first td').filter(function(){ /* additional filtering */ }), see filter

[03:31:11] <nyuszika7h> how do I find all <td>s that are not in the same parent as a specific one?
[03:31:49] <nyuszika7h> actually, never mind, that's not what I'm looking for
[04:23:40] <jimi_> I have some data that very rarely changes. It's dynamic per visitor, but static (mostly) to that visitor. How should I go about saving that data so that it's cachable, or doesn't require XHR to access it? I was thinking about persisting it to a cookie or session data on login.
[04:26:03] <basichash> kezabelle: I am getting a 404 for "jquery.min.min", whatever that is. But jQUery is definitely loading, as dropdowns are working for instance
[04:26:09] <basichash> Guys I'm trying to use the jquery-ui library, created the html with the proper ids etc, but when I code the $(function() {}) call in a <script> element, I get an "Uncaught Error: undefined is not a function" for $("#slider-range").slider({...}); any ideas?
[04:26:25] <jimi_> basichash, are you seeing that inc hrome debug?
[04:26:28] <jimi_> chrome^
[04:26:33] <basichash> jimi_: yeah
[04:26:49] <jimi_> basichash, I think that's because it tries to load it for the profiler and other things, but it's not using it for your site.
[04:27:48] <basichash> jimi_: how can I resolve it?
[04:28:18] <jimi_> basichash, I don't thinkt here is anything to resolve. It still functions without it

[05:17:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how I can pass a file with an ajax call to a server side script?
[05:17:29] <Jattenalle> ecky--ptang-zoob, use ajax POST?
[05:18:07] <Jattenalle> ecky--ptang-zoob, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4006520/using-html5-file-uploads-with-ajax-and-jquery ?
[05:19:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Jattenalle: params['filething'] = $('input#fileupload').val(); - This is how I set the file, but it won,'t pass the file itself
[05:20:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It says to use Filereader() - that's a plugin?
[05:30:35] <Jattenalle> ecky--ptang-zoob, that's just the first thing i found when i did a quick google on post ajax file upload
[05:30:55] <Jattenalle> ecky--ptang-zoob, i didnt have a proper look at it, sorry
[05:31:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[05:57:24] <Cydrobolt> how do I access a variable in a callback function?
[06:01:56] <Jattenalle> Cydrobolt, if the variable is in the global scope, just reference it
[06:02:12] <Jattenalle> Cydrobolt, [in global scope] var something; [inside your callbak] something = whatever;
[06:02:47] <Cydrobolt> yeah
[06:02:50] <Cydrobolt> however
[06:02:57] <Cydrobolt> its counting the variable as 1 above its value
[06:03:10] <Jattenalle> then something is wrong with your code
[06:13:46] <jessica_> hi, can anyone help me how to use 3d globe in google maps api?
[06:14:06] <jessica_> I have a custom three.js globe
[06:36:18] <latemus> I'm trying to get jquery.validation to validate part of a form at the click of a <button> which triggers an onclick to step forward through the form. http://jsfiddle.net/5BKwL/1/ i am trying to implement the concepts describes here under the onsubmit section where it says to set onsubmit to a function so you can cause validation to occur on another event. http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate#toptions
[06:39:09] <latemus> i think that line six of the js section of that fiddle, where i'm trying to use a placeholder is whats wrong
[06:43:15] <latemus> to be painstakingly clear: i have four sections of a form, each contians a few inputs and a "next" button which hides/ unhides to step forward. i want "next" to force validation of the formsection onclick, and not proceed until validation succeeds
[06:44:03] <latemus> submission of the form is separate from validation.
[06:55:09] <latemus> also, can jquery.validator operate on a div rather than a form? must it be a form?
[06:55:45] <latemus> ..nm, that was a dumb question..
[06:56:18] * latemus sleeplessly talks to himself

[09:03:18] <hxm> i dont know how to explain this so be patient with me
[09:03:49] <Bloomberg> hxm : you want to manage all in the same page?
[09:03:50] <hxm> in the index.php, I load a div with the twitter button, then on click, it should just go to the auth page, get the tokens and come back to the same index without refreshing
[09:03:54] <hxm> yes
[09:04:32] <Bloomberg> you should to work wth ajax
[09:04:36] <Bloomberg> you know how do it?
[09:04:45] <hxm> sure I do
[09:05:00] <Bloomberg> with ajax and json you can do it

[09:43:56] <antlong> does anyone know of a plugin to show an upcoming features, or roadmap?
[10:56:36] <johnend87> hello, i am trying to do make my navigation "sticky" and i have found a pen on codepen that seems to do what i want here: http://codepen.io/senff/pen/ayGvD except i need to abolutely position the nav at the bottom of the page, is it possible to define what offsetTop is relative to? (im quite new at this)
[10:58:46] <johnend87> at the moment the console is coming back showing cannot read property 'top' of undefined, i assume that is due to the fact that it is positioned absolutely
[11:01:41] <decx> sticky at the bottom`? what's the logic there?
[11:02:05] <decx> i scroll and scroll and then i encounter an element and then it sticks to the bottom?
[11:03:05] <johnend87> no i mean its abs positioned at the bottom now and i want to scroll and have it stick to the top
[11:03:34] <johnend87> sorry if i didnt explain that very well
[11:03:50] <nascro> Hey all, happy Saturday. What’s the best way to truncate this title to 15 characters without affecting the span? http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/mZ8Kz/
[11:03:55] <decx> youll have to draw a picture or something i don'T get it
[11:04:16] <decx> why is there an empty span?
[11:05:49] <johnend87> <nav>  is position:absolute, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0; and i want to scroll past it and have it stick to the top of the viewport
[11:06:13] <decx> absolute to what
[11:06:16] <nascro> @decx It’s a 15x15 circular container that’s filled with a background color when selected/
[11:07:00] <decx> why not use :after for a non element?
[11:07:03] <johnend87> brb i'll put it on codepen
[11:07:58] <decx> regardless of that, just wrap your to-truncate text in a wrapper
[11:09:16] <jchaike> Quick question: I have many textboxes with the ID #amountpaid. Why does $("#amountpaid").change happen for every single amountpaid textbox? It only works for the first one.
[11:09:27] <nascro> @decx good suggestions for both the pseudo class and extra wrapper, thank you.
[11:09:53] <decx> and don't forget to put the full text in title
[11:10:05] <decx> nothing worth than truncation without being able to read all
[11:10:08] <decx> worse*
[11:10:09] <shoky> jchaike: you shouldn't have duplicate ID's. that's wrong
[11:10:19] <nascro> @decx, Yeah, the plan is to add a hover tooltip to expose full title.
[11:10:47] <shoky> jchaike: and $('#amountpaid') just uses document.getElementById('amountpaid') which gets you only one element. because ID's should be unique.
[11:11:21] <jchaike> i basically have an "unlimited" number of textboxes, and for each time the textbox field is updated i want the sum to update, thats why i thought i can use the same ID
[11:11:36] <shoky> jchaike: it's wrong. use a class instead
[11:11:44] <jchaike> OH a class WOULD work for that purpose?
[11:11:48] <jchaike> didnt realize
[11:12:06] <jchaike> thank you shoky
[11:13:32] <fas3r> is it possible to put the row of the table as a selector ?
[11:14:49] <decx> why wouldnt it be?
[11:15:12] <fas3r> decx: if I ask it's because I don't know how to do :)
[11:16:28] <johnend87> so this might help a bit http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Fuqlo
[11:17:19] <BrixSat> Hello, im using a jplayer wich plays html5 audio, and it works nice except that when i press play i get 2 seconds of last data from strream and then i get the current stream
[11:18:47] <johnend87> so i think that because it is absolutely positioned the jquery cant find a parent element to work out the offsetTop and so it causes an error and i am wondering if there is a way to define the top of the viewport for this use
[11:20:08] <johnend87> if that makes sense
[11:22:48] <decx> f
[11:23:04] <decx> johnend87 use jquery offset() instead
[11:23:24] <johnend87> will that do the window then?
[11:23:55] <johnend87> i only really started looking into js and jquery about 2 weeks ago
[11:24:12] <johnend87> so im not sure what everything does yet
[11:24:42] <decx> johnend87 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/QSYZL/
[11:25:32] <decx> note that .sticky's rules must be !important as the #navigation css rules get priority
[11:25:50] <decx> either call it .navigation or live with the important
[11:26:04] <disappearedng> Does anyone know of a site where there's a list of html templates I can just copy and paste for dividing pages into multiple vertical and horizontal columns etc?
[11:26:29] <decx> search for grid choose one of 5 million
[11:31:19] <johnend87> is that just due to it being an id?
[11:31:27] <johnend87> the importance thing?
[11:31:59] <decx> ya
[11:35:31] <decx> btw, the sticky fixed nav trend is over, it's all about the quick return pattern now, where you only show the topnav fixed if the user scroll back up
[11:36:19] <decx> people are just aping mobile chrome but i guess it's better than obscured screen estate or having to scroll up for 5 minutes
[11:38:54] <damasceno> Hello. I'm having a problem with Jquery Dialog and Datepicker... This is the header of my page: http://pastebin.com/R70ejbxP it shows the date picker but the dialog doesn't work properly because it doesn't show the box in the right way. If I remove the jquery-ui.js file the datepicker doesn't work but the Jquery Dialog works perfectly. Does anyone know what I can do to fix it? I need both, datepicker and Jquery Dialog. :S
[11:40:11] <johnend87> yeah i want to do that as well as have it be sticky
[11:40:32] <johnend87> stick to the top and then scroll past and view on scroll up
[11:41:51] <johnend87> but thanks for your help
[11:41:56] <johnend87> gotta run
[11:42:33] <JackBauer24> damasceno: How on earth are we suppose to know what's wrong with your code seing headers only? It's like saying: 'hey, what's wrong with my c++ application, here are definitions from my .h file'
[11:46:09] <decx> says you but he's including jquery ui datepickerbr before jquery ui
[11:46:21] <decx> so as ridiculous as it is, that paste actually helped
[11:47:17] <JackBauer24> decx: he actually includes only translation file
[11:47:35] <JackBauer24> I assume datepicker plugin is within jquery-ui.js
[11:48:00] <decx> yeah i dont know what the translations do, but i assume you gotta put them after ui.js

[12:36:56] <Fraz> do the images fade smoothly?
[12:54:26] <JackBauer24> Fraz: yes, but the 2nd tab with stretched YouTube player hangs a website for a second
[12:54:49] <JackBauer24> and also it doesn't play the video smoothly, it's just too big

[13:07:22] <Fraz> JackBauer24, yes the video has problems. for now its just the images im interested in
[13:07:36] <Fraz> decx, yeh works now
[13:09:13] <Fraz> JackBauer24, what do you mean it doesnt play smoothly?
[13:09:21] <Fraz> plays the same as it does on youtube for me
[13:09:32] <Fraz> the video isnt great quality to start with
[13:09:38] <Fraz> seems a bit jittery
[13:10:18] <Fraz> JackBauer24, what browser are you using btw?
[13:14:06] <JackBauer24> Fraz: Firefox 29.0.1 on Linux, flash performance on Linux is lower than on Windows
[13:21:35] <Fraz> JackBauer24, theres a problem with the fading in firefox that might give the appearance of the website hanging for a second
[13:22:05] <Fraz> it doesnt fade, it just becomes visible when the opacity is 1 i think. so you see empty space then the video pops in
[13:22:12] <Fraz> do you have any other browsers installed?
[13:23:24] <disappearedng> http://jsfiddle.net/C4rSj/4/ can someone tell me how come hovering over A,B and C,D results in C,D being highlighted?
[13:30:43] <JackBauer24> Fraz: on Chrome it works fine
[13:31:02] <JackBauer24> Fraz: but on Firefox it literally freezes the browser for a 0,5-1 s
[13:32:48] <Fraz> JackBauer24, oh
[13:32:56] <Fraz> it doesnt for me. but im on windows
[13:34:05] <JackBauer24> my PC is heavily loaded right now, but still. It could also be cause by some extensions, let me check in safe mode
[13:36:16] <JackBauer24> Fraz: okay, in safe mode it doesn't freeze, there's only an issue with delayed opacity as you said
[13:43:27] <Fraz> JackBauer24, thanks for the feedback:)

[18:42:00] <uskerine> hi, i am using $('#myid').load('getData',"attrName=foo"); to retrieve html to be included in #myid. this generates a GET method /getData?attrName=foo
[18:42:23] <uskerine> how could I generate a POST method? I have read in the JQuery doc that second argument should be passed as an object
[18:42:40] <uskerine> how should I construct the object to get similar result but in POST? thanks
[18:43:46] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You'd have to use $.post and handle it your own.
[18:44:51] <BillCriswell> $.post('getData', { attrName: 'foo' }, function (result) { $('#myid').html(result); });
[18:45:20] <uskerine> thanks bill, if that works, I buy it
[18:45:30] <uskerine> just to share: this is from the Jquery doc for .load
[18:45:30] <uskerine> The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.
[18:46:26] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Ah, that's weird.
[18:48:43] <uskerine> i tried this:
[18:49:02] <uskerine> var data = {"attrName":"foo"};
[18:49:09] <uskerine> .load('getData',data);
[18:49:12] <uskerine> and it generates a post
[18:49:16] <uskerine> i think is easier to read
[18:49:33] <uskerine> should I use the double quotes while generating the object?
[18:50:17] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Doesn't matter.
[18:50:21] <uskerine> ok
[18:50:57] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I've been working with jQuery for a while and never even considered that passing the data as an object would change the request method.
[18:51:14] <antlong> i've seen it work like that in python
[18:51:23] <shoky> surprised me too
[18:52:16] <HowardwLo> could anyone assist with my scrolling snapping image issue :)
[18:52:19] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/8/
[18:52:36] <HowardwLo> im trying to make it so that when you scroll past the image, it’ll position fixed itself on your screen so its always there
[18:52:37] <BillCriswell> shoky: Glad I'm not alone lol
[18:55:03] <BillCriswell> antlong: Interesting.
[19:00:12] <uskerine> I think is more readable than using .post, but that's a subjetive matter. for me everything in JQuery is new, so I am not used to anything, just found it on the doc while wondering why .load forced to use GET
[19:00:46] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Readable sure, obvious on the other hand.
[19:01:20] <shoky> HowardwLo: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/9/
[19:01:21] <BillCriswell> That would drive me nuts trying to debug it more than likely.
[19:01:33] <shoky> HowardwLo: oops
[19:01:54] <HowardwLo> shoky: ops?
[19:02:35] <HowardwLo> shoky: oh..it works! but it doenst release :D let me see
[19:02:43] <shoky> HowardwLo: it worked good, then i added that fixed boolean and forgot to make the required change, sec
[19:02:57] <HowardwLo> shoky: thanks for assisting!
[19:04:56] <antlong> does anyone know of a jquery plugin for roadmaps? I want to put on on my site. somethign to display features upcoming, and a changelist
[19:05:46] <shoky> HowardwLo: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/10/
[19:06:26] <shoky> HowardwLo: the reason i added the boolean 'found' flag is so you don't do a css/addClass update on EACH scroll, only when it passes the exact offset
[19:07:01] <HowardwLo> shoky: ah i see
[19:07:20] <HowardwLo> shoky: thanks!
[19:07:39] <BillCriswell> antlong: I mean... I kind of feel like that would be best handled manually? What would you gain from a plugin here?
[19:08:22] <antlong> BillCriswell the visual part of it, is what im ideally looking for, but i'll take what i can get.
[19:10:17] <BillCriswell> antlong: I guess I'm having a hard time imagining what a roadmap would look like.
[19:11:02] <antlong> BillCriswell me too, thats why i figured i would ask.
[19:11:15] <BillCriswell> I think of a pretty basic list when I think of that.
[19:13:43] <obert> hello, 0 and 1 in js are true and false? i never remember this
[19:13:55] <shoky> no
[19:14:03] <shoky> 0 is 0, 1 is 1, true is true, false is false
[19:14:49] <BillCriswell> They can be truthy and falsey... probably not the best idea to rely on that though.
[19:15:48] <obert> sometimes i find 0 and 1 used to enable/disable features in plugins
[19:16:02] <obert> then asking
[19:16:58] <shoky> what plugins
[19:17:16] <shoky> anyways.. 0 is falsy in a boolean context yes. 1 is truthy
[19:36:07] <obert> shoky: an old one plugin. thanks
[19:36:48] <obert> when i write 'old' means that probably is obsolete, but i will find a better solution in the future
[19:37:10] <obert> it is sat night, at last
[21:13:45] <nascro> Hey all, what’s the best way to truncate text in an element using jquery? For example, I want to select an element, then truncate its text to 100 characters.
[21:36:09] <rickys> hi. .html() doesn't work on an xml document in safari/ie. is there a good way to get around this?
[21:36:12] <rickys> http://jsfiddle.net/EGk3k/2/
[21:36:59] <rickys> i don't want to use .text()/textContent as it removes tags
[21:46:42] <rickys> actually, got it. nevermind thanks
[21:52:33] <HowardwLo> mosh mosh!
[21:54:55] <HowardwLo> so i ahve this brilliant code someone on here helped me create http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/ , but i wanted to make it so that anytime you scroll up, the image would also scroll up. once the image hits the top, it’ll stop and go fixed again. i’m not sure how to begin, because I think that would mean I ahve to make the image float?
[21:56:06] <HowardwLo> i think its alot more compliccated than just position fixing an image?
[23:01:46] <HowardwLo> can anyone assist? http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/ works, but not when the image is smaller than the screen  http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/13/
[23:10:13] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/14/ this is the best i can come up with…feels kinda hacky
[23:11:24] <mehwork> if $(this) is an <div> element that contains an <input> element, how can i target the input?
[23:12:25] <sacho> .find('input')
[23:12:46] <mehwork> thought so but
[23:12:58] <mehwork> when i did .find('input').checked = true it didn't work
[23:13:05] <mehwork> it's a type="checkbox"
[23:13:26] <sacho> jquery objects are not dom elements
[23:13:35] <sacho> use .prop()
[23:13:40] <mehwork> .attr()?
[23:13:42] <mehwork> ok
[23:13:53] <sacho> and learn.jquery.com instead of guess-coding
[23:15:29] <mehwork> learning is the easy part, remembering is the hard part
[23:15:43] <mehwork> i've learned and forgotten all this stuff many times over the years
[23:15:56] <mehwork> sometimes guess coding is just trying to recall programming :p
[23:22:37] <HowardwLo> So i’m trying to get the image to not leave the screen when i scroll. If the image is larger than the screen, the image will always fill up the screen. It worked for images bigger than my screen http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/ but not for images smaller. I can’t have the image fixed like http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/14/ , but I cant htink of a better way
[23:28:01] <HowardwLo> free internet cookies*
[23:34:40] <zzing> Is there any sort of extension that allows easy creation of dom objects using a fluent api instead of just text strings?
[23:46:07] <HowardwLo> is there a way to do this : http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/ without using bottom: 0; ?
[23:46:19] <HowardwLo> for position fixed that is^
