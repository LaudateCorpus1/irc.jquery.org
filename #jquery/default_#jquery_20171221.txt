[00:51:09] <rocketmagnet> hi all (good morning)
[00:55:30] <rocketmagnet> can someone please help me, i need a javascript library that let me draw 2d diagrams of all kinds and i must make them interactive so the mouse can hover over the data and display infos when hovering the diagrams
[00:55:59] <rocketmagnet> isn't html5 allready good for such stuff ?
[01:32:17] <Cork> rocketmagnet: have a look at raphaël if you want svg, or one of the canvas based libs
[01:32:58] <Cork> personally i would recommend raphaël as it for one is element based and second is vector so it scales well (canvas is pixel based so doesn't scale if you resize)
[03:47:26] <undefined_bob> I had a problem with a little script. It didnt work because an other script wasnt ready when the little one was executed. so i added a setTimeout but I feel thats not the best way
[03:47:34] <undefined_bob> $('document').ready( function() { if (window.location.href.indexOf('#') != -1) { window.setTimeout(function() { $('#' + window.location.href.split('#')[1]).parent().click(); }, 300); } } );
[03:47:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[03:47:53] <undefined_bob> its only one line but yeah I make one
[03:48:08] <robertmaxrees> you said there were multiple scripts involved :)
[03:48:13] <Cork> robertmaxrees: have a callback from the "other script" and have that script fire it when it is done
[03:48:22] <undefined_bob> https://jsfiddle.net/hzqyfLLf/
[03:48:23] <Cork> timer is never a good choice as it is racy
[03:48:36] <robertmaxrees> so what's the other script?
[03:49:04] <undefined_bob> yes, but all the others would be too much but I have a test page online which shows it all. And/or I can paste the other script too
[03:49:19] <robertmaxrees> what's the page?
[03:49:19] <undefined_bob> the other script is kinda long
[03:49:35] <undefined_bob> http://undefined.bplaced.net/das-sind-wir/index.html#TEST_NEU
[03:49:46] <Cork> undefined_bob: so check for where it does the change you care about and add a function call from there
[03:50:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:50:15] <undefined_bob> the other script is for the accorsion, open and display content and so on
[03:50:19] <robertmaxrees> is this just to expand the section in the hash?
[03:50:32] <undefined_bob> the one liner, yes
[03:50:44] <Cork> undefined_bob: then just bind the callback from the accordion
[03:50:52] <robertmaxrees> put your one liner after the ddaccordion init
[03:51:13] <Cork> heh ya, even better
[03:51:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[03:51:26] <undefined_bob> for example before </body> ?
[03:51:37] <robertmaxrees> anywhere after the ddaccordion init.
[03:51:38] <Cork> move it from line 26 to line 61
[03:51:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:51:56] <undefined_bob> thanks, I'll try that :)
[03:52:10] <robertmaxrees> basically, it should be jquery -> plugins/etc -> your stuff
[03:52:41] <Cork> undefined_bob: and if that doesn't work you can remove the ready wrapper and move the if case into line 55
[03:52:55] <undefined_bob> yes, the code is pretty spaghetti
[03:53:24] <Cork> anyway there are plenty of ways to do this without a timer :)
[03:54:29] <undefined_bob> good to know, thank you very much :)
[03:57:30] <hellyeah> hey
[03:57:44] <hellyeah> can you suggest me datepicker with time selection?
[03:58:00] <hellyeah> jquery uşi datepicker doesnt have something for selecting time
[04:00:12] <Cork> just google jquery timepicker there are a lot
[04:00:23] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon (haven't used it so test around)
[04:05:52] <undefined_bob> yay it seems to work http://undefined.bplaced.net/das-sind-wir/index.html#our_offices
[04:06:04] <undefined_bob> thank you again :)
[04:17:15] <hellyeah> Cork,  thanks
[05:52:08] <jita> if i try to do $('#foo').find('input[name*="bar"]') i get syntax error, unrecognized expression, how can i do this ?
[05:54:27] <jita> nvm it was a syntax error
[05:54:44] <Cork> ya, that line is just fine
[06:03:23] <cerion> hi. I am refreshing an image every minute with some js and jquery using a timestamp. It seems the browser do it even if the tab/page is not currently viewed. How can I restrict the refreshing of the image only if the page is viewed or onyl when the page is seen.
[06:04:14] <Cork> cerion: use a requestAnimationFrame
[06:04:21] <Cork> and then setTimeout to call it again
[06:04:25] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
[06:04:39] <cerion> Cork: ok; looking into that. thanks
[06:05:24] <Cork> so something like (function update() { requestAnimationFrame(function() { /* update */ setTimeout(update, 10000); }) })()
[06:05:49] <Cork> ^ will update every 10 seconds as long as the page is in view
[06:05:57] <Cork> (and if you get back into view)
[06:07:46] <cerion> oh. there is a visibilitchange event
[06:12:14] <Cork> cerion: this is how i would do it https://jsfiddle.net/gpqwcrho/
[06:14:04] <Cork> heck you could make it completely dynamic if you like, and have it work for all images with a specific class: https://jsfiddle.net/gpqwcrho/1/
[06:14:30] <Cork> (without the extra selector) https://jsfiddle.net/gpqwcrho/3/
[06:19:26] <cerion> Cork: why do setTimeout inside update ? it's kind of recursive that way ?
[06:26:14] <cerion> https://jsfiddle.net/mpsu955g/2/ ??
[06:41:17] <undefined_bob> it worked only for a bit but now I removed the document ready wrapper and put the if inside of the other script. that seems to work for now
[06:58:33] <cerion> I mean https://jsfiddle.net/mpsu955g/4/ with the correct API meaning document['hidden'] is obsolete
[07:13:32] <Cork> cerion: not kind of it is recursive
[07:13:54] <Cork> cerion: only difference is that it is recursive through two function calls (setTimeout and requestAnimationFrame)
[07:14:12] <Cork> and it needs to go through both or you will get buffering and unneeded updates
[07:24:47] <cerion> Cork: fine. But I prefer to use visibilitychange api. that what it is meant for after all
[07:24:49] <nikio_> i have a feeling that i can  work much more efficiently when writing a client in jquery than when using frameworks like angular
[07:25:33] <Cork> cerion: actually requestAnimationFrame is more exactly for what you're trying to do
[07:26:04] <Cork> visibilitychange is more to ex. stop a timer when a timed test is moved out of focus or something like that
[07:26:21] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame is "tell me when you need to update the page content for rendering"
[07:26:29] <Cork> and that is exactly what you want
[07:27:50] <Cork> its also newer and not event based and those are two other fairly big pluses
[13:06:57] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[13:07:58] <taplar> aloha
[13:13:33] <poboy> mahalo
[13:56:22] <Uhkis> evening
[14:50:19] <Neo1> I put my OOP code on stackoverflow and one guy said I did perfect code :) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47899715/how-correctly-to-make-oop-class-with-javascript-and-jquery
[14:51:00] <taplar> i see "looks good".  I don't see "perfect"
[14:51:30] <taplar> but kudos
[14:52:29] <Neo1> ok, I understand 'looks good' like perfect....
[14:52:54] <taplar> perfect means without a flaw
[14:53:20] <Neo1> have other problem, with wp plugin OOP, can't there do objects so easy like in js :(
[14:53:36] <Neo1> taplar: ok
[14:54:08] <taplar> i'm confused what you mean wp plugin OOP vs js
[14:54:15] <Neo1> taplar: I'll unite to stackoverflow community, is it good for learning JS?
[14:54:47] <taplar> Stackoverflow is technically for asking about issue with a problem.  Not really a discussion forum
[14:54:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:55:11] <Neo1> taplar: there I create class for each shortcode and seems there something wrong because my classes calls a few times. I won't explain, very much
[14:55:25] <taplar> but you're writing javascript, right?
[14:56:07] <Neo1> taplar: but I can't find in English good js forum, there all forums use not CMS that I like, all of them made like stackoverflow.
[14:56:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:56:23] <Neo1> taplar: javascript php, c++ c#
[14:56:29] <Neo1> four languages
[14:56:39] <taplar> the wp plugins are written in those four languages?
[14:56:52] <Neo1> taplar: two php javascript
[14:57:11] <taplar> you understand that php doesn't run in the browser, right?
[14:57:30] <Neo1> taplar: yes, its my first language, of course I understand
[14:57:52] <Neo1> taplar: see this forum javascript.ru. it's the best, but I want similar in English
[14:57:56] <taplar> so, maybe php is used to construct the javascript that is use for the plugin, but the plugin is javascript, no?
[14:58:37] <Neo1> taplar: it is used for output html and javascript
[14:58:53] <taplar> right, and the outputted javascript, is the plugin, yes?
[14:58:54] <Neo1> input output data
[14:59:26] <Neo1> taplar: javascript exists in plugin, yes UI
[14:59:47] <taplar> so with that said, "with wp plugin OOP, can't there do objects so easy like in js" is a weird statement
[14:59:54] <Neo1> taplar: javascript OOP is easier than php
[14:59:58] <taplar> as the plugin -is- javascript
[15:00:14] <Neo1> taplar: yes, as I said easier
[15:00:32] <taplar> k
[15:02:01] <Neo1> taplar: do you know some good js forum?
[15:02:11] <taplar> not really.  i hang out in here
[15:02:22] <Neo1> where can speak about general theme OOP, programming, create 'holly war' themes
[15:02:33] <Neo1> taplar: ok
[15:02:46] <robertmaxrees> intentionally creating “holy wars” is a great way to get yourself banned from places.
[15:02:50] <robertmaxrees> that’s called trolling.
[15:03:48] <Neo1> taplar: in Ru net many good forums, but I want English... Good when you know two languages, can use both spaces. Two world :)
[15:05:24] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: no, it's, for this not ban, you probably didn't understood, it's themes like what is better 'linux or windows' or 'what cms is better', or 'what language is the best', This is called 'holly war'
[15:05:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:06:04] <robertmaxrees> sparking those kinds of discussions is often considered trolling.
[15:09:22] <taplar> pretty evident with the usage of the word 'war'
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:09:48] <robertmaxrees> they often don’t lead to any meaningful conversation and only serve to rile people up.
[15:09:58] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: trolling is when people say not truth intentionally , for example in real I think windows is the best but for trolling and got some reaction my partner I say linux is the best, say false, When you say truth your mind and why you think so, it's called convey your mind. Not trolling
[15:10:10] <taplar> no
[15:10:18] <taplar> trolling is causing conflict intentionally
[15:10:49] <taplar> conversations based on opinions are easily turned in to troll convos
[15:10:55] <Neo1> taplar: word war? I only recent understood what it means, in Russian it's one word holywar, and people don't know English meaning, for us it's just means 'hot theme for speaking without end'
[15:11:05] <alturic> Hey guys, forgive me if this is the wrong channel, I just don't know if its PHP-related or jQuery-related. However, when sending data via AJAX, should I be able to return a response to the browser while the page is loading or does the entire page need to be loaded?
[15:11:22] <taplar> you can do it while loading
[15:11:41] <taplar> ajax is non-blocking, and you can make an ajax call before the page is fully loaded
[15:11:54] <alturic> Hmm, so an echo at the very top of the php file (that is being AJAX'ed) I should be able to actually echo back to the browser while the rest of the page is processing in the background?
[15:12:18] <taplar> yep, though without the whole page loaded yet, using that response will be a little iffy
[15:12:27] <taplar> depending on what you're wanting to do
[15:12:46] <alturic> Oh no, page1 is fully loaded. I click a button and it fires off an AJAX request to a second page. On the second page I have an echo at the very top of the PHP script, but the entire script seems to have to process before page1 can receive the echo response.
[15:13:04] <taplar> so page 2 returns html?
[15:13:09] <alturic> JSON
[15:13:14] <taplar> just json?
[15:13:17] <alturic> Yes.
[15:13:23] <taplar> so that's fine
[15:13:49] <taplar> and yes the entire script will run
[15:13:54] <alturic> So then since it seems like the entire script has to process before the browser seems to get the response, it would be a nginx/php configuration issue?
[15:13:55] <taplar> you're hitting that endpoint
[15:14:12] <taplar> not if you are returning just json and not mixing content like json and html
[15:14:29] <taplar> though, if all you are concerned about is the top part, why not split that off into it's own endpoint?
[15:14:29] <alturic> I've tried all sorts of different flush behaviors, etc, it seems to still require the entire script to process before the browser gets the JSON.
[15:14:51] <taplar> otherwise you'd have to do a conditional exit or something in the php
[15:15:28] <alturic> Well, the AJAX'd script does some DB stuff in a try/catch. In the try it returns a success JSON, in the catch it returns an error. AFTER that, it processes the submitted data further, but I only need the echo'd response sent back on the DB submit.
[15:15:52] <taplar> so you'd have to do a conditional exit after the json echo in some use case
[15:15:54] <alturic> It's processing the entire page though (and the "process the submitted data further" is completely outside of the try/catch) before sending back that echo.
[15:16:18] <taplar> ah
[15:16:27] <taplar> so A happens, B, happens, A is echoed
[15:16:30] <taplar> and you just want A
[15:17:25] <taplar> ?
[15:17:50] <alturic> A happens in a try/catch and the try echo's something or the catch echos something, B happens and THEN the echo finally gets sent back for some reason.
[15:18:10] <taplar> if you echo something in the try catch it is echoed
[15:18:16] <taplar> it will not be flushed into the end though
[15:18:17] <alturic> So I *think* if I should indeed be able to get that try/catch echo while the B is happening, it must be a PHP/nginx config issue?
[15:18:33] <alturic> Since it literally seems like the entire script is processing before sending the A happens "echo".
[15:18:45] <taplar> that's the normal flow of a request/response interaction though
[15:18:57] <taplar> if you want results before the whole thing is done, you have to change the request type
[15:19:05] <taplar> which the type is escaping me right now
[15:19:09] <Neo1> alturic: what the config issue?
[15:19:54] <Neo1> alturic: don't understand about you are speaking, but probably you want to use if?
[15:20:19] <taplar> do you know robertmaxrees?
[15:20:35] <Neo1> no
[15:21:08] <alturic> Just trying to confirm, if (in a PHP script), I should be able to echo "hi"; sleep (10); echo "done"; that the browser (via AJAX) should be able to get the hi, then 10 seconds later get the done.
[15:21:26] <taplar> no
[15:21:35] <taplar> it will get them all at once, unless you change the response method
[15:21:51] <Neo1> alturic: sleep off php program, you can do timer in javascript
[15:21:58] <taplar> most requests send the whole response at the very end, but you can change it so that it sends back a response as it gets data in the stdout
[15:22:39] <Neo1> alturic: for make delay in js use this setTimer(function(){here your code},10000);
[15:22:45] <Neo1> 10 seconds delay
[15:22:52] <taplar> he's not talking about hte js
[15:23:03] <taplar> he's talking about getting a response from the server while the request is still being processed
[15:23:28] <alturic> Exactly taplar
[15:23:58] * taplar is googling for the term he is forgetting
[15:24:02] <alturic> At this point, I'm thinking about shifting that "further processing" outside of the submission script entirely and run a queue to do the processing, but... yea.
[15:24:05] <Neo1> taplar: response and request, it's sequence
[15:24:09] <taplar> chunked!
[15:24:15] <taplar> you have to make the response chunked
[15:24:41] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2481858/how-to-make-php-generate-chunked-response#14904957
[15:24:58] <Neo1> alturic: it's impossible, you can get only consistently
[15:27:32] <Neo1> a it's probably need for transfer get big files, I haven't encountered with it yet
[15:29:25] <robertmaxrees> sorry was away for a sec.
[15:29:27] <robertmaxrees> what’s the issue?
[15:29:45] <taplar> dude wants to chunk his response
[15:29:51] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[15:29:52] <taplar> i forgot the term 'chunked'
[15:29:56] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:30:00] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[15:32:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, skimming the convo that sounds like what alturic wants.
[15:36:10] <alturic> Well, thank you for your time. I got something to look into now.
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> woah i just realized it’s thursday
[15:41:38] <taplar> hell yeah
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[16:10:26] <taplar> 3 more hours
[16:10:55] <robertmaxrees> taking tomorrow off, yeah?
[16:11:06] <taplar> nah, i just ready to go home and crash
[16:11:16] <taplar> i think my throat thing is coming back, which is annoying me
[16:11:52] <taplar> it like never fails.  vacation comes up, get sick, lol
[16:12:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:12:58] <taplar> i am wanting to play around with twitch more though.  i streamed for the first time yesterday.  still dunno wtf i'm doing though
[16:14:00] <robertmaxrees> what’d you use to stream?
[16:14:08] <taplar> OBS
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> nice.
[16:14:26] <robertmaxrees> that’s what I use.
[16:15:07] <taplar> i was a little nervous about just downloading and installing a random software app, but it was listed on a toms hardware page, and on the twitch site so I gave it a pass
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:16:13] <robertmaxrees> they’ve made some solid updates recently.
[16:16:51] <taplar> i'm grateful for the auto config option, even if it is beta.  i couldn't figure out how to make it capture my whole resolution before i used it
[16:19:41] <taplar> where do you stream?
[16:23:31] <robertmaxrees> twitch.  i went hard into it for a few months and then stopped.
[16:29:01] <taplar> i streamed for like 2 hours last night, but forgot to check the option to auto save broadcasts, >_<
[17:44:09] <z1haze> I have a little group of functions I've written to 'disableForm' and 'enableForm' on my application. Basically all it does it prevent people from submitting a form twice (our platform doesnt play nicely with disabled buttons) and it also adds a little loading indicator to the form action so you konw things are happening in the background, etc..
[17:44:54] <z1haze> Problem I have come across is that for some ajax forms, we dont necessarily replace the form in a failed response scenario, and I need to change the button content back to its original value, but I currently have no place to store it. I am wondering if a simple jquery plugin might be a good thing for this?
[17:45:16] <taplar> an overlay is good for this use case
[17:45:37] <z1haze> Yeah, I dont have any say in what I am to do :) this is all work stuff
[17:45:47] <z1haze> its set it stone what they want to happen, I just have to implplement it
[17:45:58] <z1haze> 1 sec, I'll share my little file
[17:46:17] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/22M4M6P
[17:46:44] <z1haze> basically I just have a disable,enable function. I tried storing the form in a data prop, but it actually gets overridden each time disableForm is called so thats not going to work
[17:47:12] <z1haze> so I need a better way to store the form for later retreival (and there are multiple forms on the page) so i can just use a local variable in the file
[17:47:23] <taplar> wait, why are you storing the form?
[17:47:34] <z1haze> because I am changing the markup inside the submit button
[17:47:45] <z1haze> and on scenarios where the page doesnt reload/change, i need to change it back
[17:47:54] <taplar> I don't understand why you have to store the -whole- form for that though
[17:48:01] <z1haze> I dont
[17:48:06] <z1haze> I could just store the button html
[17:48:09] <z1haze> but thats still the problem
[17:48:27] <z1haze> I stored the form because I didnt know at the time maybe i'll need other things in the future
[17:48:30] <taplar> In any case if you are going this route, i'd store the buttons original content on the button itself as a data field
[17:48:56] <z1haze> right, but then when disableForm gets called again, it gets set to what it was set to the first time
[17:48:58] <z1haze> which isnt the original
[17:49:14] <taplar> how can you disable it twice?
[17:49:21] <taplar> i thought you were preventing multiple accesses
[17:49:26] <z1haze> Im going to tell you.
[17:49:33] <z1haze> lets say button is called 'continue'
[17:50:07] <z1haze> you click the button, and we call disableForm, we set the data 'submitted' to try, add the loading classes, etc, change the button html, and go about submitting the form
[17:50:37] <z1haze> if a user clicks the form again, we call disableForm again, and check to see if the form is already been submitted
[17:50:44] <z1haze> if thats true, i return false
[17:51:01] <z1haze> as I originally stated, our platform does not play well with literally 'disabled' attributes on buttons
[17:51:16] <taplar> ok
[17:51:37] <taplar> but if it returns false, why would you update it's text again?
[17:51:49] <z1haze> see my dpaste?
[17:51:58] <taplar> i do, and your logic is outside the if
[17:52:00] <taplar> i'm asking why
[17:52:15] <z1haze> so here's how its called: http://dpaste.com/1RJW8X6
[17:52:45] <taplar> ok, so disable form would not be called again while it is submitting
[17:52:55] <z1haze> yea I guess thats a bad scenario to show, haha
[17:53:02] <z1haze> this is how i originally designed it for my latest work
[17:53:07] <z1haze> now i have to integrate it into legacy stuff
[17:53:11] <z1haze> which .. isnt this way
[17:53:13] <z1haze> 1 sec
[17:53:45] <z1haze> here's the legacy stuff http://dpaste.com/38S4R6N
[17:54:16] <taplar> ok, but lets talk about the logic
[17:54:23] <taplar> brand new page
[17:54:29] <taplar> user clicks button
[17:54:36] <taplar> you submit the form and you change the button
[17:54:45] <z1haze> correct
[17:54:55] <taplar> user clicks the button again, you return false, button is not updated again
[17:55:04] <taplar> if the form has not finished submitting
[17:55:07] <z1haze> I think I know what I need to do
[17:55:17] <z1haze> I'm failing to check if form is already submitted in this legacy stuff
[17:55:22] <taplar> sounds like it
[17:56:26] <taplar> at least from the thought that you'd update it twice when you don't want to update it twice, that in itself is a code smell
[18:01:56] <z1haze> yeah I just wasnt using my method :\
[18:53:34] <Guest90519> omg finaly i fixed the scroler
[18:53:37] <Guest90519> gah
[19:03:40] <Guest90519> is there a way to have ui lis to arrange wide instead of stacking
[19:06:04] <Guest90519> help the kid out
[19:06:08] <Guest90519> any1?
[19:06:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:06:18] <Guest90519> comon gaise
[19:06:23] <Guest90519> be a friend
[19:06:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[19:06:31] <Guest90519> i am asking....
[19:06:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle or something?
[19:06:41] <Guest90519> no
[19:06:45] <Guest90519> u know this
[19:06:55] <Guest90519> i have li ul ul ul
[19:07:02] <Guest90519> but they are stacking
[19:07:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:07:10] <Guest90519> once they reach teh right side
[19:07:13] <robertmaxrees> that’s not a valid structure if it’s what i thjink you mean.
[19:08:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ej6bsuut/ this has jquery and jqui on it.
[19:08:08] <robertmaxrees> basic markup to get you started.
[19:08:22] <robertmaxrees> if you update this I can much more quickly understand what you need.
[19:08:57] <Guest90519> comon i know uve done this a million times
[19:09:00] <Guest90519> so have i
[19:09:20] <robertmaxrees> i have literally no idea what you’re askign duder.
[19:11:01] <Guest90519> ok im not gona fix it
[19:11:12] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you want to have your LIs display left to right instead of top to bottom?
[19:11:30] <Guest90519> i got them to go left to right
[19:11:39] <robertmaxrees> ‘kay.
[19:11:44] <Guest90519> but they start another row once they reach the right side
[19:12:00] <Guest90519> so now i have to do width with js
[19:12:18] <robertmaxrees> how are you making them horizontal?
[19:12:19] <Guest90519> like go thru all the lis
[19:12:27] <Guest90519> and add up the total_width
[19:12:31] <robertmaxrees> ‘cause i’m pretty sure you can do that using css.
[19:12:37] <Guest90519> right
[19:12:44] <robertmaxrees> like, without jquery.
[19:12:45] <Guest90519> i want it to just do it
[19:12:53] <Guest90519> all on one row
[19:13:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ej6bsuut/1/
[19:13:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ej6bsuut/2/ woops
[19:13:52] <robertmaxrees> no need for that overflow.
[19:13:58] <robertmaxrees> and for the record, there’s an entire css channel :)
[19:14:04] <Guest90519> i know
[19:14:08] <Guest90519> but i like it here
[19:14:18] <Guest90519> this is my home
[19:14:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn’t change the topic of this channel (Shrug)
[19:18:08] <Guest90519> hmm its not working
[19:18:19] <Guest90519> now they are all stacking in one col
[19:18:33] <robertmaxrees> obviouslyh it does work.
[19:18:34] <Guest90519> i have some complex divs inside teh lis
[19:18:36] <robertmaxrees> as I showed.
[19:18:37] <robertmaxrees> so.
[19:18:45] <robertmaxrees> you’re probably breaking the layoutr.
[19:20:06] <Guest90519> i screwed it up
[19:23:27] <Guest90519> aaand i fixed it
[19:23:33] <Guest90519> inline-block
[19:24:09] <robertmaxrees> just be careful with that since whitespace suddenly becomes important.
[19:26:49] <Guest90519> ?
[19:27:49] <robertmaxrees> like, in your markup.  it can cause things to still layout like block-level elements.
[19:32:04] <Guest90519> wth
[19:32:13] <Guest90519> now i cant get the right width in js
[19:34:00] <Guest90519> gosh i am just so screwed up
[19:34:10] <Guest90519> well i didnt make this code
[19:35:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you using js?
[19:35:28] <Guest90519> to make it scrol
[19:37:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:38:01] <robertmaxrees> css duder.
[19:39:10] <Guest90519> i did the css
[19:39:16] <Guest90519> like u pasted
[19:39:28] <robertmaxrees> why are you using js to make it scroll?
[19:40:41] <Guest90519> buttons
[19:40:55] <Guest90519> and
[19:41:22] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i give up.
[19:41:25] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[19:41:26] <Guest90519> its scrolls to the last fully visible li
[19:47:13] <Guest90519> crap
[19:47:39] <Guest90519> now the js is not positioning right
[19:47:52] <Guest90519> after doing the css changes
[19:50:36] <Guest90519> i had to revert to the js driven version
[19:50:41] <Guest90519> its working good
[19:51:27] <Guest90519> id have to start from scratch to have it all css driven
[19:51:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:52:25] <Guest90519> i built a way more complicated scroller before
[19:52:35] <Guest90519> whoever made this one is crazy
[19:52:55] <Guest90519> it was getting stuck
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> do you mean carousel?
[19:53:01] <Guest90519> yes
[19:53:34] <robertmaxrees> i’d kill that carousel tbh.
[23:17:03] <TeddyMurray> can someone help me with the form on workfar.com in the top right corner? If i press sign up it actually sends the Login data instead. Is that because im embedding forms in tables? i use a $.submit() event on those forms -- i checked the names and they are correct.
[23:25:34] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray poking.
[23:26:03] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[23:26:06] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS for this?
[23:28:58] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[23:35:17] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray
[23:35:33] <robertmaxrees> can't see the problem by looking at the page.
[23:35:40] <robertmaxrees> how do I know it's submitting for login?
[23:46:11] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, when i type data in the login form and press sign up, it works correctly
[23:46:48] <robertmaxrees> soooo when doesn't it work correctly?
[23:47:18] <TeddyMurray> when i type in an email, password, for the registration form, and press sign up -- then it sends blank email and passwords
[23:47:25] <TeddyMurray> because the login form isn't filled out
[23:47:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?  i'm super lost now lol
[23:47:50] <TeddyMurray> the js is in the page
[23:47:53] <TeddyMurray> its not external
[23:47:59] <robertmaxrees> you said earlier than when you press sign up it's sends the login info.
[23:49:04] <TeddyMurray> right, it does, that's the error, i was just saying that if the login form is blank, it sends blank info instead of the registration info
[23:49:07] <TeddyMurray> hope that makes sense
[23:49:25] <TeddyMurray> thanks for helping
[23:49:49] <robertmaxrees> so what handles the form submits?
[23:50:01] <robertmaxrees> utility.js?
[23:50:32] <TeddyMurray> when i check the network tab in chrome inspector under the page it requests, the variables are blank if login form is blank when im creating an account. utility.form.post is my wrapper for $.post because im adding some tokens and loading animations
[23:51:16] <robertmaxrees> if (failedRegex == false) {
[23:51:19] <TeddyMurray> $.submit() is on the page itself let me find it
[23:51:22] <robertmaxrees> this looks pretty relevant
[23:51:27] <robertmaxrees> $.post(sUrl, $("#login_form").serialize(), function(jPostFormResults) {
[23:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that looks to be your issue.
[23:51:41] <TeddyMurray> hmmmmm
[23:51:42] <TeddyMurray> wow
[23:51:43] <robertmaxrees> check your failredRegex var.
[23:51:51] <robertmaxrees> *failedRegex
[23:52:11] <TeddyMurray> thank you so much
[23:52:14] <TeddyMurray> that fixed it
[23:52:20] <robertmaxrees> rad
[23:52:30] <TeddyMurray> i dont know how i had such a major typo on line 37
[23:52:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[23:52:53] <TeddyMurray> most important fix today, i commend you
