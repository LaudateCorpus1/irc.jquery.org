[00:36:41] <giucio> hi, is there a way to calculate the distance between the mouse cursor and the page border? Thanks!
[00:39:17] <Cork> giucio: you could check the event.clientX/clientY value

[00:44:57] <hexacode> any function to empty an element...lets say a div contains  whole tree of children. how do i just empty it? erase everything it contains?
[00:45:32] <hexacode> like if i wanted to empty an entire webpage, $('body').cleanup() ??

[01:36:07] <Batata> hi can someone give me a hand please I'm a n00b to this JS / JQuery thing so please bear me for a min.
[01:36:55] <Batata> so I have made a index page and a css and a js file
[01:39:16] <Batata> http://jsfiddle.net/jVRjA/
[01:39:50] <Batata> my objective was to make a stiky menu
[01:40:17] <Batata> and as you scroll the menu stays on top
[01:40:19] <DevAntoine> intercepting a form submit using .submit I'm wondering why I just can't return the result of the "confirm()" function?? Instead if confirm is false I have to use preventDefault() or return true if it returns true
[01:41:11] <Batata> but the JS / JQuery is not working
[01:41:46] <Batata> can anyone give a hand to my n00b a** please?
[01:47:04] <xec> Batata: have you tried position: fixed; in css?
[01:48:13] <xec> DevAntoine: returning false should do the trick
[01:48:40] <xec> DevAntoine: "we can cancel the submit action by calling .preventDefault() on the event object or by returning false from our handler" from http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[01:49:46] <Cork> Batata: http://jsfiddle.net/jVRjA/7/
[01:50:37] <Cork> DevAntoine: you should avoide return <bool> from event listeners
[01:50:55] <Cork> cause if you have any other event listeners bound on the same event they will break
[01:51:06] <airdem> how do i use .map on a select to get all options as an associative array? (value and text)
[01:51:33] <xec> airdem: there is no associative array in javascript
[01:51:45] <airdem> object
[01:51:50] <Cork> airdem: $.map($('select option'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text(); })
[01:52:21] <xec> airdem: .map returns an array
[01:52:29] <Cork> airdem: $.map($('select option'), function(elm) { return { text: $(elm).text(), value: $(elm).attr('value') }; })
[01:52:41] <airdem> Cork, exactly, thank you
[01:54:39] <xec> airdem: that will be an array of objects
[01:56:56] <xec> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/7Evxh/
[01:59:54] <airdem> xec, works good, thank you
[02:01:58] <DevAntoine> Cork: what should I do instead of returning bool from my event listener?
[02:02:52] <xec> DevAntoine: preventDefault(), like you suggested
[02:03:12] <xec> if (confirm(whatever)) e.preventDefault()
[02:03:34] <xec> or rather !confirm() depending on the wording
[02:14:10] <frosch> Hi!  Is there any jQuery util method that helps to find out if an object has no properties / is "empty"?

[03:21:52] <Syrit> guys, i am trying to test my ajax loader gif, so i want to emulate some ajax request , is there any sleep function ?
[03:22:05] <bartocc> is there a jQuery.grep equivalent that would return the first matched element of the array ?
[03:22:23] <xec> ?api first @ bartek
[03:22:23] <b-ot> bartek: .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[03:22:24] <xec> doh
[03:22:31] <thinced_> Syrit: setTimeout
[03:22:35] <xec> sorry bartek, that was for bartocc
[03:22:49] <Syrit> thanks thinced_
[03:23:54] <bartocc> xec: thx, but I need to apply a function to the elements
[03:24:07] <bartocc> .first() will only return the first element of the array, no matter what
[03:24:16] <xec> ok, so .filter() then?
[03:25:18] <bartocc> when I search for is just the convenience method for jQuery.grep([1, 2], function(e) { e == 1})[0]
[03:25:46] <Syrit> i think its not a jQuery function thinced , is it ? it's JS right ?
[03:25:49] <bartocc> xec: filter also returns an array if I am correct ...
[03:26:21] <thinced> Syrit: no it is not,
[03:26:33] <thinced> See here: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
[03:26:36] <xec> bartocc: no, filter acts on the collection it was called on and returns a reduced jquery collection - $.grep is for arrays
[03:27:04] <Syrit> thanks
[03:27:08] <xec> bartocc: i was assuming you had a jquery collection
[03:27:11] <thinced> Syrit: I mean it's just javascript
[03:27:31] <bartocc> xec: nope, I have an array of objects, sorry if I was not clear
[03:27:44] <xec> bartocc: ok, use grep then :)
[03:27:53] <Syrit> yes i get it , thank you thinced

[04:07:33] <xec> that pastie is really messy

[04:17:48] <nisseni> xec: sorry, not layer.
[04:21:47] <ste_123> Hi all. Should adding a hidden form element using jQuery .append() or .attr() cause that value not to be submitted in the form?
[04:23:20] <xec> nisseni: so, what are you trying to do?
[04:24:09] <nisseni> xec: getting a post like this: http://pastie.org/private/ie3vjjytnc6ji8qt18g9a - via jquery
[04:26:29] <nisseni> xec: might have figured it out
[04:32:09] <xec> ste_123: adding a hidden input element in a form with .append() will cause it to be passed along when the form is submitted
[04:32:23] <xec> ste_123: .attr() will only read/write attributes
[04:38:10] <ste_123> xec: I've just written a small test page and I can get this working using .append so it's something I'm doing wrong in my app
[04:38:30] <ste_123> xec: I'll continue to figure out the problem now I can see a working example where append is used
[04:47:48] <krambiorix> hi, i have a draggabe i want to drop in a div with mutiple droppables.  The wrapper div has, initially, a width of 50 pix. When i go over it with my draggable i made it to have a width of 200px.  But when i go out of the initiall 50px width, the div is back to it initial state. In other words, i can only go over the div with its initial dimensions. This is the first time i type a paragraph with more then 3 times the word "ini

[05:25:10] <dutchjquery> Hi
[05:25:30] <dutchjquery> are there any responsive wysiwyg editors that work pretty good on tablets/smartphones
[05:31:39] <DevAntoine> I'm looking for a simple search plugin which will search from the text inside the page, but I don't even know which words I have to look for
[05:33:08] <slax0r> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/926580/find-text-string-using-jquery
[05:33:23] <slax0r> if it's only inside the current page
[05:33:31] <Cork> DevAntoine: why would you need to?
[05:33:40] <Cork> that browser provides that by default
[05:34:16] <slax0r> if you want to search additional web sites like search "text" from index.html and you want to find it in page.html, then I'd advise using something else than jquery or any client-side script for that matter
[05:34:44] <slax0r> Cork, does the browser search find items that are "display:none"?
[05:34:54] <Cork> uh, no
[05:35:06] <Cork> they explicitly avoid those
[05:36:33] <dutchjquery> Hi
[05:36:50] <dutchjquery> are there any responsive html editors (tablets/smartphones etc...0
[05:41:26] <harpal> I am creating parallex website. I dont have much idea. Can anyone suggest me some script I can use it?
[05:42:09] <dutchjquery> Hi harpal why not use links like (#mysection) and then make it scroll smoothly with a jquery script
[05:45:04] <slax0r> parallex websites don't only make a dull scroll to a content, the content can "fly in" or fade in or whatever from any direction when scrolling
[05:47:45] <harpal> dutchjquery: but then I have to apply every main div with same height and width. Do I need to do manually?
[05:48:16] <harpal> slax0r: yes, depends upon content is visible it do animations in site.
[05:48:37] <slax0r> uhm, I have a slider on my page, it works smoothly on a desktop, but on iPad it's laggy as hell, any tips how to debug this?
[05:49:19] <dutchjquery> yeah kinda you could just apply different classes and specify custom heights for it, and the width is the width of the browser/device window?
[05:53:38] <harpal> dutchjquery: yes
[06:08:51] <doev> How can I use an accordion in another one, when I need to use same tags? for example <h3>
[06:11:37] <chilversc_> is there any way to get the text value a user has input in to a numeric field?
[06:12:11] <AlexanderBB10> type="phone" i think

[06:42:32] <glambert> any suitable options for $.parseHTML equivalent in 1.7.X?
[06:43:16] <Cork> glambert: $()
[06:43:49] <glambert> would that also handle child elements?
[06:43:55] <Cork> yes
[06:44:07] <Cork> (that is still true in later versions)
[06:44:23] <glambert> ah right, neat, didn't know that.
[06:44:30] <glambert> what's the point in $.parseHTML then?
[06:45:11] <Cork> $() is a combination function
[06:45:22] <Cork> it does a lot of other things beside parsing html
[06:45:32] <Cork> (it runs $.parseHTML internally)
[06:45:45] <Cork> so if you have something that looks like a selector it won't parse it
[06:45:49] <Cork> it will use it as a selector
[06:45:59] <glambert> I see
[06:46:00] <glambert> thanks
[06:46:24] <glambert> I'm doing a $.get() that will generate HTML to replace an element on the page with
[06:56:14] <xec> glambert: then just do $("#elementOnPage").html(htmlFromServer) ?

[07:45:19] <rcr> i see, thank you
[07:45:46] <BillCriswell> rcr: Use .on() instead.
[07:45:46] <itschrisg> rcr: no problem. Check out .delegate as the alternative: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:46:18] <grafi> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[07:46:20] <BillCriswell> rcr: .on() would delegate as well. I think .on() is what's preferred.
[07:46:21] <grafi> fyi
[07:46:34] <BillCriswell> superseded sounds douchy.
[07:46:48] <BillCriswell> I couldn't write manuals. I'm too nice.

[07:55:46] <rcr> ah, so i dont know if this makes a difference, but i think the reason .live() was being used was that these elements were being added dynamically, and then needed to trigger on click
[07:56:03] <rcr> with .on() is there some special way this has to be added?
[07:56:26] <NoiseEee> rcr: same idea, delegate on a common parent

[08:08:29] <sukima> How do you resolve a Deferred using a fulfilled/rejected promise? In other Promise/A the resolve() function can take a value OR a promise and the promise from the deferred becomes the passed in promise (either fulfilled with value or rejected with reason) is this not the case in jQuery?
[08:09:24] <sukima> http://jsbin.com/aMeMuBo/1/edit

[08:26:09] <eddyb> sukima: nah, I'm pretty sure it's the same thing as .click()

[08:30:37] <Tingle> I have this wierd issue, im doing this: http://hastebin.com/jepafumebo.xml and it tells me "SyntaxError: unterminated string literal @ http://localhost/:22" which points to my if statement. Any idea what is causing this?
[08:30:53] <Tingle> it goes away if I replace </script> with </scr'+'ipt> for example
[08:32:05] <eddyb> uhm, faking the click doesn't really work at all :(
[08:32:06] <snover> html doesn‚Äôt understand javascript
[08:32:09] <snover> tingle
[08:32:29] <snover> the html parser sees the literal string "</script>" and that means the script tag is done
[08:32:37] <snover> use "<\/script>"
[08:32:44] <eddyb> Tingle: that's actually what you have to do, </scr'+'ipt> and equivalents are widely used
[08:32:48] <Tingle> that or \x3c
[08:32:55] <snover> or, better yet, don‚Äôt create html scripts in your scripts
[08:32:56] <eddyb> Tingle: no, that's just ugly :))
[08:33:36] <Tingle> oke
[08:33:38] <Tingle> ill do that then
[08:34:06] <Tingle> why not create html scripts in my scripts? I need to check if jQuery is loaded, and if not get my local version
[08:36:56] <kittonian> hi all. can someone explain how apple is doing the front page of their website? I need to do something along these lines and have been searching for what it's called but can't seem to find other examples. i want the page to automatically horiztonally scroll with the circles as navs and the ability to have the paddles on the left and right sides of the screen to go back and forth. you can see this all at www.apple.com right now
[08:37:18] <eddyb> Tingle: you want to add a script element to the document?
[08:37:30] <kittonian> they seem to be combining html5 and jquery since they are using the <section> element
[08:38:29] <eddyb> Tingle: you can/should use the DOM to do that
[08:39:18] <boytoy_> Can someone recommend a better way to code this nav menu: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/13/ -- just looking for a better concept, not actual code.
[08:40:11] <boytoy_> Especially with regards to checking whether each .visible or .invisible's last child is a div or an a -- and then adding / removing pseudo element bullets accordingly.
[08:40:14] <Tingle> eddyb: this is what I'm doing: http://hastebin.com/jidutokoca.xml is there a better way to go about it?
[08:40:43] <eddyb> kittonian: I saw a very simple technique and I make it work with both previous/next buttons https://gist.github.com/eddyb/9b8b5ea8c336d2dc038d
[08:41:50] <BillCriswell> kittonian: If you're using bootstrap they have an example that's basically that out of the box. http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/carousel.html
[08:42:19] <eddyb> Tingle: yes. it's something like var s = document.createElement('script'); s.src = './libs/..../jquery.min.js'; document.head.appendChild(s);
[08:42:43] <Tingle> what is better about that than using documen.write?
[08:42:55] <BillCriswell> async.
[08:43:03] <Tingle> async?
[08:43:13] <eddyb> BillCriswell: not just that. document.write is a complete hack
[08:43:16] <BillCriswell> document.write blocks
[08:43:22] <BillCriswell> eddyb: Yeah, it's no good.
[08:43:25] <Tingle> Im doing this at the bottom of my html file, so I dont know if it matters
[08:43:38] <Tingle> but k, if you guys say doing it like that is the way to go, Ill do it ^^
[08:44:02] <eddyb> parsing HTML from JS (especially like that) is a bad idea, it's better to create the HTML elements directly
[08:44:16] <Tingle> ok
[08:44:42] <eddyb> Tingle: you can wrap the code in an IIFE - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression
[08:45:14] <BillCriswell> Tingle: http://www.igvita.com/slides/2013/breaking-1s-mobile-barrier.pdf This whole thing is awesome, taught me a lot, but page 25-26 explans a bit.
[08:45:37] <eddyb> great, document.getSelection() doesn't expose the caret inside an <input> :(
[08:45:44] <kittonian> BillCriswell: that's pretty close but it's not as smooth as what apple has in place
[08:47:01] <eddyb> kittonian: smooth? you can always add CSS3 transitions
[08:47:32] <BillCriswell> kittonian: Might have to use CSS animations to get it that smooth?
[08:47:38] <Tingle> interesting, doing that I can add my script loading back into the header and not at the bottom of the page?
[08:47:52] <eddyb> Tingle: your code would work in the header
[08:48:00] <Tingle> but doesnt jQuery's .ready() do that same?
[08:48:33] <eddyb> (I mean, even the old one)
[08:48:47] <eddyb> and I'm pretty sure .ready is deprecated, use $(function() { ... });
[08:48:53] <Tingle> I thought we had options like including script files at the bottom of the html file, or using the .ready() function from jquery
[08:49:06] <Tingle> for fast loading and non-blocking behavior
[08:49:07] <kittonian> thanks guys
[08:50:15] <Tingle> eddyb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11043656/async-and-document-ready
[08:50:25] <Tingle> bottom seems to be best practice
[08:50:37] <eddyb> Tingle: ah, those are old wives' tales, some guy on stackoverflow (don't have the answer link handy, sorry) did a benchmark and modern browsers work very well with everything in <head>
[08:50:57] <eddyb> (I mean, the performance stuff)
[08:51:10] <Tingle> mm that link is describing the async method as code breaking
[08:51:35] <eddyb> the method isn't async, BillCriswell was confusing you
[08:51:47] <Velveeta> he has that effect
[08:51:47] <BillCriswell> Which isn't?
[08:51:50] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:52:04] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah. =(
[08:52:34] <eddyb> Tingle: that guy on SO used async explicitly
[08:53:16] <Tingle> actualy, what about adding the async="true" to the <script> tag?
[08:53:29] <eddyb> that's what he did
[08:53:32] <Tingle> ah yea
[08:53:34] <Tingle> just saw that
[08:53:54] <Tingle> mmm so whats this with it conflicting int he header and .ready() and stuff
[08:54:10] <Tingle> as described in that SO post I linked
[08:54:31] <Velveeta> he was saying that with async scripts, document ready fires sometimes before the scripts are finished loading
[08:54:34] <eddyb> it might change the order the scripts are executed, which makes sense
[08:54:51] <Velveeta> because document ready fires with the DOM is ready, not necessarily head scripts that are async-loaded
[08:55:03] <Velveeta> when*
[08:55:08] <Tingle> then what about doing what you said at the bottom of the page, but with async false
[08:55:22] <eddyb> that's why you should use DOM for those kinds of scripts and stick an onload event on them. or jQuery's .load
[08:55:29] <BillCriswell> I love SO, but I feel like the more though I put into an answer the less likely it is to be upvoted haha.
[08:55:32] <Velveeta> we load our scripts at the bottom of the page, just to speed up the perceived load time of the page
[08:55:41] <eddyb> Velveeta: which is old wives' tales
[08:55:49] <Velveeta> i don't see how
[08:56:05] <BillCriswell> Also, when people want to use regex and you tell them no, just do this, they don't like that.
[08:56:08] <Velveeta> if scripts are blocking, then it stands to reason that loading them after the content would speed up the content load time
[08:56:32] <eddyb> like I said, someone did a recent benchmark, modern browsers don't do that
[08:56:38] <eddyb> (I hope I'm remember it correctly)
[08:56:44] <Velveeta> i'd like to see a link to that benchmark
[08:56:51] <Velveeta> and what they were actually testing'
[08:57:07] <Velveeta> because if they tested the time to document ready firing, that wouldn't change in either case
[08:57:26] <Velveeta> but if they were benchmarking the time to content rendered, that should, depending on the method used
[08:58:39] <eddyb> dammit, I was close, but not on target, with my memory: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9271276/is-the-recommendation-to-include-css-before-javascript-invalid
[08:59:00] <eddyb> you can probably use the inspector to do some rendering tests in chrome
[08:59:18] <Velveeta> oh yeah, css vs js order doesn't really matter in the head
[09:01:36] <Tingle> mm well so far after reading a couple other things and listing to you guys, loading js files through DOM at the bottom of the html file without async gives the better practice. also not needing to use jquery .ready() is nice. and not using async will allow proper loading order
[09:02:01] <Tingle> so I think I'll go with that
[09:02:08] <Velveeta> so that's interesting what he was testing there, because i've never heard a recommendation to put css before js or vice versa if we're talking about the head, i've always heard both are blocking, and you just want to make sure your css is loaded in the head so that it can apply to the body as it's spewed out
[09:02:24] <maxmoore14> anyone have info on JQM 1.4 release schedule?
[09:02:43] <Velveeta> tingle: like i said, we load our js at the bottom of the body‚Ä¶ however, that being said, we also use document.ready ;)
[09:02:48] <Tingle> also as of html5, I dont think one would have to do .typ ='text/javascript'; anymore
[09:03:03] <Velveeta> right, the type attribute is optional in html 5 for scripts
[09:03:21] <Tingle> yeah, I guess document ready gives a cleaner feel even if it isnt needed
[09:03:30] <Tingle> Ill continue to use that
[09:04:02] <Tingle> and do you load your files over script, document write or DOM create element?
[09:04:23] <Velveeta> actual script tags
[09:04:30] <Tingle> k
[09:04:42] <Velveeta> there's only one case we use document.write, and that's for our test runner, which embeds the tests into the page dynamically at runtime
[09:06:57] <Velveeta> regardless, that SO link that was put out there by eddy is a good read
[09:07:09] <Velveeta> i hadn't heard of this 'speculative parsing' optimization
[09:08:07] <shwaiil> hi
[09:08:17] <BillCriswell> Magic.
[09:08:24] <grafi> automagic
[09:08:35] <Velveeta> when is html going to support the sorcery tag?
[09:08:46] <Velveeta> <sorcery data-details="make my site awesome" />
[09:08:56] <Velveeta> somebody buy my startup now, please
[09:08:56] <grafi> haha
[09:09:04] <grafi> i buy it
[09:09:08] <grafi> 50ct

[09:09:11] <shwaiil> Q: For Masonry users. The non jquery way of prepending elements is  msnry.prepended( elems ) http://masonry.desandro.com/methods.html#prepended . I'm wondering what should I do if I'm using jquery ? fooContainer.masonry('prepended', elements) maybe ?! thanks for looking!
[09:09:11] <Velveeta> sold!
[09:09:16] <grafi> wohooo
[09:09:19] <grafi> what did i buy?
[09:09:20] <grafi> :D
[09:09:36] <Velveeta> a one-line custom tag html document
[09:09:48] <grafi> i feel that was worth the investment
[09:10:01] <Velveeta> don't forgot to document.createElement that sorcery tag for ie7 support
[09:10:14] <grafi> i dont support ie7
[09:10:15] <grafi> :P
[09:10:30] <Velveeta> look at the new ceo already making big decisions!
[09:10:38] <grafi> always^^
[09:12:18] <mintux> i want to show some html using jquery . should i use put them inside .html() ?
[09:12:33] <mintux> i mean copy past html inside javascript ?
[09:15:13] <grafi> you should hire my newly aquired startup to help you solutionize a solution
[09:17:00] <rdldew> Hi everyone. I'm still a bit new into jQuery plugin creation and need a bit of coaching. Can someone give me a little feedback or ideas on my plugin solution?
[09:17:01] <rdldew> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/removing-last-item-but-not-being-specific
[09:17:22] <boytoy_> How do I determine whether the last child is a <div> or an <a>? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WxeG3/
[09:17:49] <Velveeta> use the .is() function, pass it a selector
[09:17:54] <Velveeta> if (elem.is('div'))
[09:18:30] <boytoy_> Velveeta: I should be doing it right, I don't know
[09:18:54] <Velveeta> oh i didn't notice the fiddle link
[09:18:55] <boytoy_> if ($(this).children().last().is('div')) right? Its structure is #main > div > determine here
[09:19:08] <boytoy_> Ah :)
[09:19:12] <Velveeta> yeah that looks fine
[09:19:41] <Velveeta> the only way to shrink the function count down on that would be to use .children(':last'), but i think .children().last() is actually slightly faster, the way you have it written
[09:19:42] <mintux> i have some nested divs but i can't put them inside .text() or .html() my IDE return a lot of error also i try escaping ' or "
[09:19:44] <Tumulte> does anyone have some skills about history.js ? I can't get the back/next buttons to work
[09:20:13] <boytoy_> Velveeta: is that because the 1st relies on css and the second is pure jquery or something like that?
[09:20:48] <Velveeta> i think it's because the first has to evaluate, for each element, whether that selector applies to it
[09:20:58] <Velveeta> whereas the 2nd one just grabs the note list and returns the last element in it
[09:21:01] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Ever listen to yuck?
[09:21:12] <NoiseEee> dunno them BillCriswell :|
[09:21:21] <boytoy_> oh ok.. makes sense..
[09:21:38] <boytoy_> why this fiddle won't work though.. does not make sense :p
[09:22:01] <rdldew> boytoy
[09:22:12] <rdldew> Change to alert instead of console.log for that
[09:22:16] <rdldew> There is no console there
[09:22:25] <darkfrog> any updates regarding browser support for HTML5's clipboard API?
[09:22:26] <BillCriswell> Just heard of them the other day, finally getting around to really listening. Liking what I'm hearing so far, Their wikipedia page said "Critics have likened the band to bands such as Dinosaur Jr, Pavement, My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth." so I figured I'd ask.
[09:22:30] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: ^^
[09:22:34] <boytoy_> No luck with children(':last') by the way
[09:22:40] <boytoy_> rdldew: good idea
[09:22:47] <rdldew> It worked for me :)
[09:22:54] <grafi> alert is never a good idea o√¥
[09:22:56] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: oh neat i'll check them out, i'm into 4/4 of those bands
[09:23:04] <rdldew> grafi: just for his jsfiddle
[09:23:08] <rdldew> Not in realtime work
[09:23:11] <grafi> not even there
[09:23:15] <devslash> i dynamically create a table and a button which i position next to the table using setTimeout. is promise() a better way to wait until $('body').append(tablecode) finishes before positioning the button
[09:23:16] <grafi> o√¥
[09:23:24] <grafi> [object][Object]
[09:23:25] <rdldew> Well his jsfiddle doesn't have a console to show the log
[09:23:26] <boytoy_> rdldew: it worked for you?
[09:23:31] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Nice.
[09:23:35] <grafi> well firebug/devtools
[09:23:36] <grafi> <.<
[09:23:44] <rdldew> http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WxeG3/
[09:23:57] <rdldew> Wait
[09:23:58] <rdldew> Wrong
[09:24:24] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Never heard of pavement, listened to the top of search for them and this "cut your hair" video is solid.
[09:24:35] <rdldew> Yeah, boytoy_ just change the console.log to alert for this case
[09:24:44] <rdldew> Then click run
[09:24:53] <Velveeta> pavement did a song for the schoolhouse rock rocks album
[09:24:56] <boytoy_> rdldew: yep http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WxeG3/1/
[09:25:23] <boytoy_> rdldew: but it oughta report that the last child is not a div.. any clue as to why it doesnt do that?
[09:25:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: "No More Kings", I like the sound of that.
[09:25:35] <rdldew> Look at your if statements
[09:25:38] <grafi> "More Kings"
[09:25:40] <grafi> more like it
[09:25:42] <devslash> has anyone here used promise()
[09:25:42] <Velveeta> it's a pretty great album altogether :D
[09:25:55] <rdldew> You said "if ($(this).children(':last').is('div')) {         alert('Last child is a div -- WRONG')"
[09:25:58] <Velveeta> i like ween's the shot heard round the world rendition
[09:26:07] <BillCriswell> grafi: You can add a "," and you're good to go!
[09:26:08] <rdldew> You're saying if it IS a div, then say it's wrong.
[09:26:22] <BillCriswell> "No, more kings!"
[09:26:25] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: one of those bands that influenced 10,000 others
[09:26:50] <boytoy_> rdldew: Yes, but it is not a div hence the alert in the else clause oughta run right?
[09:27:21] <rdldew> Wait one... I'll read through it again
[09:27:32] <boytoy_> rdldew: Last element in this case is the <a>Test</a>
[09:28:11] <grafi> not if you echo $(this).children().last()
[09:28:17] <grafi> because it logs a div
[09:28:20] <grafi> for me
[09:28:39] <boytoy_> hmm no way
[09:28:58] <grafi> try it
[09:28:59] <grafi> :o
[09:29:36] <Velveeta> main's last child *is* a div
[09:29:44] <Velveeta> if you're looking for the a, you have to go deeper
[09:29:49] * Velveeta gives you an Inception stare.
[09:29:54] <BillCriswell> Just realized the lead singer of Tripping Daisy sounds like Dale Gribble from King Of The Hill
[09:29:55] <grafi> xD
[09:29:56] <boytoy_> yeah children().children() apparently
[09:29:58] <boytoy_> haha
[09:30:00] <shwaiil> Q: When I do .prepend('<div>Element</div>') how can I select this same element I just prepended ?
[09:30:02] <grafi> Inception jokes
[09:30:05] <grafi> i love it
[09:30:31] <Velveeta> shwalil: use prependTo
[09:30:46] <grafi> really? cool
[09:30:54] <Velveeta> instead of target.prepend('<div>Element</div>'), use $('<div><Element</div>').prependTo(target)
[09:31:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Dammnnn beat me to it.
[09:31:09] <BillCriswell> Just used that trick haha.
[09:31:17] * Velveeta flexes his Popeye-like typing fingers.
[09:31:27] <rdldew> boytoy_: isn't the only child of #main an unnamed div?
[09:31:33] <shwaiil> Velveeta: thanks for looking! Why prependTo instead ? And can I select this same element I just prepended ? I need to send it as a param to a different plugin
[09:31:38] <rdldew> That unnamed div (on line 2) has two children of its own.
[09:31:39] <rdldew> Right?
[09:31:46] <juozapas> im using jquery-cookie plugin but somehow $.removeCookie('cookie', { path: "/" }) creates another cookie with the same name, when it should delete it. here is a code http://pastebin.com/L8qNNte1
[09:32:16] <Velveeta> shwalil: those 2 functions act on different objects, with prepend, you're specifying the subject as the object you're prepending to, whereas with prependTo, you're specifying the subject as the object being prepended
[09:32:19] <juozapas> any ideas what can be wrong ?
[09:32:20] <shwaiil> Velveeta: Worked perfectly actually!
[09:32:26] <boytoy_> rdldew: Here's the actual case -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/14/ -- might make more sense (or not)
[09:32:26] <Velveeta> and yes, you can return that directly into a variable to pass
[09:32:33] <shwaiil> Velveeta: thanks a lot ; )
[09:32:34] <boytoy_> Line 14 :S
[09:32:38] <Velveeta> no problemo
[09:32:50] <devslash_> hi
[09:33:13] <boytoy_> 63 lines to do something that simple.. kinda depressing
[09:33:34] <grafi> what are you trying to do exactly? ^^
[09:33:35] <rdldew> lol you'll figure out the concise code after it works.
[09:34:05] <Velveeta> yeah, always start out just trying to make it work properly, then optimize :)
[09:34:08] <devslash_> I dynamically create a table and a button which i position next to the table using setTimeout. is promise() a better way to wait until $('body').append(tablecode) finishes before positioning the button
[09:34:21] <boytoy_> grafi: basically i have a list of links. some are only links but some contain dropdowns and hence must be wrapped in a div
[09:34:32] <Velveeta> devslash: you'd have to know when to resolve that promise programmatically if you used a promise
[09:34:36] <boytoy_> grafi: one batch of links should be visible at all times and the other batch of links should only be visible on hoverIntent
[09:34:52] <devslash_> Velveeta: how do i say when action A finishes, perform action B ?
[09:34:54] <rdldew> brb changing client
[09:35:14] <Velveeta> well that's simple, in pseudo code like that, but it entirely depends on what action A is
[09:35:29] <devslash_> $('body').append(htmlcode)
[09:35:34] <devslash_> just as an example..
[09:35:43] <rdldew> There
[09:35:55] <Velveeta> for that specific example, i would probably use a setTimeout of 1ms
[09:36:09] <devslash_> i thought that its bad to use settimeout
[09:36:20] <Velveeta> not necessarily, it depends on what you're using them for
[09:36:46] <Velveeta> lots of UI-related stuff uses setTimeout 1 just to give the browser a chance to breathe and catch up on other tasks between heavy manipulation
[09:37:16] <devslash_> im trying to replace settimeout with promise(). i did that on another project and it seems to load much faster
[09:37:29] <Velveeta> and it definitely can, given the proper use case
[09:37:30] <benlieb> how do I assign an arbitrary function to all matched elements of $()
[09:37:43] <devslash_> so whats the right way?
[09:37:46] <Velveeta> there's no 1 method to replacing setTimeouts with promises, you have to use them properly
[09:38:19] <Velveeta> so, i'm in the middle of refactoring a shit-ton (that's a *metric* shit-ton, btw) of unit tests from using setTimeouts for actions, to using events that resolve deferred objects that run the tests
[09:38:44] <Velveeta> in that case, i couldn't just say click to create this popover menu, then wait 10ms and run the test, because in some slower browsers, 10ms might not be enough
[09:38:51] <devslash_> it seems to me that settimeout is not reliable
[09:39:05] <Velveeta> so i had to tie the tests to the events, like popoveropen, to make sure those things had had a chance to complete
[09:39:17] <Velveeta> setTimeout is completely reliable *for the proper use cases*
[09:39:17] <Tingle> is there a opposite to the onload DOM event?
[09:39:25] <Tingle> unloadfailed or something
[09:39:27] <Velveeta> tingle: before unload?
[09:39:42] <Velveeta> unload failed? no, i don't think so
[09:39:45] <Tingle> well onload wont get triggered if it failed
[09:39:54] <Velveeta> but there's a beforeunload event when you're leaving the page
[09:40:06] <Tingle> mm not what Im looking for :P
[09:40:15] * boytoy_ goes for a jog (the best way to activate the brain and see things more clearly)
[09:40:27] <Tingle> trying to see if the file loaded or not
[09:40:28] <Velveeta> you can set your own timeout to specify when unload has failed
[09:40:39] <Tingle> mmm k
[09:40:42] <Tingle> think I have an idea then
[09:40:47] <Velveeta> now, are you talking about an ajax load?
[09:40:53] <Velveeta> because there's an error event for those
[09:41:23] <Velveeta> devslash: so back to your question, not all "actions" are created equal
[09:41:33] <Velveeta> some are more prone to using promises than others
[09:41:56] <shwaiil> Q: What's the best practice to bind a click event when creating an element ? For example, if I'm not generating this items dynamically it would work nicely $('#foo').on('click', fn() { ... }); and having to do this every time foo is created is very verbose. Can I get some advice ? thank you!
[09:42:02] <Velveeta> in the case of something like append(), that action *should* be fairly immediate, but there's nothing browser specific that can tell you that the action has completed
[09:42:21] <Velveeta> hence, there's nothing you can tie to as an event listener, to say "this action is now completed" and resolve your promise
[09:42:46] <Velveeta> shwalil: use a delegated event listener
[09:43:11] <rdldew> Create a plugin too, maybe?
[09:43:25] <rdldew> Then use the plugin whenever you want to perform the action.
[09:43:32] <rdldew> Any thoughts on my plugin conundrum? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/removing-last-item-but-not-being-specific
[09:43:42] <benlieb> Is there a way to do this without each? I want to define a function for each matched element: $( "li" ).each(function() { $( this ).myfunc = function() { } });
[09:44:10] <pachet> benlieb why do you want a unique function for each one
[09:44:23] <Velveeta> you could write that function as a plugin, and make it iterate over the collection internally, and return 'this' at the end
[09:44:58] <Velveeta> but pachet makes a good point, that creates a separate function reference for each pass through the loop, you should declare the function separately and pass it by name
[09:45:13] <benlieb> pachet: so I don't have to pass a bunch of vars around.
[09:45:18] <Velveeta> well actually, in that case, i guess it doesn't
[09:45:27] <mintux> i want some message or errors that want to show in one box not place under another one like this: http://www.uploadax.com/images/73267104613471603313.jpg this message box produced with this code : http://www.uploadax.com/images/32905040578006986498.jpg i want to show first message then click on close show next message . and i want this be dynamic get messages from server so each one the number of messages are different . what is best way to this ?
[09:45:30] <Velveeta> because each takes callback as a parameter, so it would be a single instance of that callback var
[09:45:34] <boytoy_> One more try before I go: At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/15/ -- how come my checkLastChild() function is unable to determine whether the last child is a div?
[09:45:37] <boytoy_> It uses returns and calls which I'm not familiar with, but I was told it was the best way.
[09:45:43] <KWhat_Work> Anyone have a creative tip for getting the hight of elements before they are rendered?
[09:45:50] <benlieb> pachet: there's a bunch of data- attributes involved, and the element will be 'self' aware if it has it's own function.
[09:46:01] <pachet> Velveeta the callback is the same, but the function created within it is unique to each element being iterated over
[09:46:10] <Velveeta> kwhat_work: cross your fingers and use Math.random() ?
[09:46:10] <benlieb> pachet: but that's not the question anyway. is there a way to do that without the each?
[09:46:18] <mintux> should i write program for close button ?
[09:46:30] <pachet> benlieb i mean, iterate natively over the list? i dunno
[09:46:34] <itschrisg> KWhat_Work: Render off-screen, measure height, re-render on-screen
[09:46:34] <pachet> i think you're going about it the wrong way
[09:46:35] <KWhat_Work> Velveeta: not to different from how CSS works huh
[09:46:53] <KWhat_Work> itschrisg: just abs position and -9999 ?
[09:46:57] <benlieb> pachet: there aren't that many elements involved, so speed isn't an issue.
[09:46:58] <pachet> benlieb the idiomatic way to have forking logic in functions dependent on the originating element is to leverage context
[09:47:05] <devslash_> Velveeta: ok thanks. the other project i mentioned where i used promise after something like an append made the page render immediately
[09:47:10] <pachet> eg, 'this' inside the function points to the element in question
[09:47:18] <berndj> do i just need to provide a .ui-tabs-hide { display: none; } to make my tabs show up one at a time rather than showing all of them all of the time?
[09:47:28] <pachet> then fetching whatever data you need from data attributes is as easy as $(this).data('whatever')
[09:47:47] <pachet> and viola, you have a single function that can serve for all of your elements
[09:48:13] <pachet> its as easy as:
[09:48:26] <Velveeta> devslash: so the way setTimeout works is that it waits for the current execution chain to finish, and then checks to see if that timeout has expired, so if you had a lot of other stuff going on that was synchronous code, then setTimeout would cause a delay, whereas if part of that code was the promise being resolved, it would cause that callback to be fired immediately in the middle of that execution chain
[09:48:51] <Velveeta> without seeing what code you're actually referring to, i can't tell you for sure why you seem to have such a dramatic increase in performance on something like append
[09:49:04] <pachet> function foo ( ) { console.log($(this).data('foo'); }   $('li').each(function ( elem ) { elem.foo = foo.bind(elem); });
[09:49:30] <benlieb> pachet: I like that too but in this case I'm defining a reload() function on elements of different types. Then I just have to call any element's reload() and not worry about what is involved in that reload every time
[09:50:09] <pachet> i still think you're better of having a fixed plate of functions that take whatever elements they need as their calling context, so that function declaration and element iteration arent 1:1
[09:50:16] <Velveeta> pachet: using that method though, you're creating N instance properties of that function on those elements
[09:50:25] <pachet> but you know what you're doing better than i do, follow your heart
[09:50:31] <benlieb> pachet: :)
[09:50:36] <pachet> Velveeta cheaper than function declaration
[09:51:10] <devslash_> Velveeta:  part of the performance increase was from changing a call to a php script using $.post to using $.ajax with async enabled
[09:51:42] <Velveeta> but you're still creating a function declaration, you're just additionally now tying that to N instance references
[09:51:59] <Velveeta> why not create a function declaration and invoke it with call/apply to change the scope of this internal?
[09:52:02] <Velveeta> internally*
[09:55:30] <Velveeta> whoa, an ex-coworker just sent this link out, this effect is crazy: http://imgur.com/opNnoOx
[09:55:43] <Lewix> Hi all
[09:56:32] <rdldew> Hello
[09:59:16] <Lewix> I have several images and I want to trigger an event when someone click on each images. $('#image_list a").click(function foo {//whatever}) seems to work. Does the event method click traverse the array, I was expecting $('#image_list a").each.click(function foo {//whatever})
[10:01:02] <NoiseEee> Lewix: . $('#image_list a") returns a collection of elements matching that selector, so yes, it applies to all at once.
[10:02:50] <Lewix> NoiseEee: in plain javascript it wouldn't be possible , would it. we will have to use the for loop - i guess it's some jquery magic
[10:03:38] <NoiseEee> Lewix: kind of part of the point of using jquery :)
[10:04:17] <LoneSoldier728> hey so how do i check if a checkbox was selected, I read about the .length === 1 or >0
[10:04:32] <LoneSoldier728> but everytime i unchech it, it seems to still think that the length is 1?
[10:06:07] <rdldew> Did you check out :checked ?
[10:06:11] <rdldew> http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[10:06:23] <rdldew> This came up quickly http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2008/12/how-to-check-if-checkbox-is-checked.html
[10:06:39] <LoneSoldier728> ya i tried that... : /
[10:06:39] <Lewix> NoiseEee: true
[10:06:41] <LoneSoldier728> let me see
[10:07:24] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/CG3xtry3
[10:07:27] <LoneSoldier728> this is my code
[10:07:35] <Lewix> Can we only use the attributes as methods on images? image.src image.title
[10:07:48] <LoneSoldier728> .attr is not working
[10:08:03] <LoneSoldier728> well i have
[10:08:27] <LoneSoldier728> the code being ran once the check box is clicked
[10:08:39] <LoneSoldier728> can that affect it?
[10:09:01] <itschrisg> LoneSoldier728: Show us your code?
[10:09:35] <rdldew> He did
[10:09:39] <rdldew> http://pastebin.com/CG3xtry3
[10:09:42] <LoneSoldier728> ok here
[10:11:06] <mintux> i want to remove an html element using jquery but i want something happened when it removed how can i do that?
[10:11:19] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/KAkMH4Cv
[10:11:20] <LoneSoldier728> there
[10:11:29] <LoneSoldier728> the html is on the bottom
[10:11:35] <LoneSoldier728> I am actually using backbone.js
[10:11:40] <LoneSoldier728> for the framework if that helps
[10:11:42] <mintux> using .find() ?
[10:11:47] <ravenzz> elem.remove(); doSomething(); ?
[10:12:08] <ravenzz> or even better elem.remove(); $(document).trigger('elemRemoved');
[10:12:48] <LoneSoldier728> the html p tags is what is being pointed to be this.$el tho...
[10:12:53] <ravenzz> $(document).on('elemRemoved', doSomething);
[10:12:56] <LoneSoldier728> hm ok
[10:12:58] <LoneSoldier728> maybe i got it
[10:13:24] <mintux> i'll test it thanks
[10:13:35] <LoneSoldier728> how do i call the specific checkbox, if this.$el
[10:13:39] <LoneSoldier728> is selecting the p tag
[10:13:44] <LoneSoldier728> surrounding the checkbox
[10:13:49] <LoneSoldier728> do i do .closest
[10:13:50] <LoneSoldier728> or somethin
[10:15:35] <mintux> ravenzz: my element id is my-alert so i wrote this code: $("#my-alert").on('elemRemoved',function(){  alert("Something"); });  but didn't work
[10:15:41] <rdldew> Probably or something
[10:17:02] <mintux> ravenzz: i have message box on my page as alert that has close button when click on it . it disappear  i want when disappear completed something happen
[10:19:02] <rdldew> mintux: Did you use a confirm() instead of alert()?
[10:19:47] <rdldew> Actually, I'm not sure that even matters. You could probably build a function and call it inside the ( ) .
[10:19:52] <mintux> no it's a div you can see here http://www.uploadax.com/images/73267104613471603313.jpg
[10:19:55] <rdldew> That's just quick thinking. I've never tried it.
[10:20:16] <LoneSoldier728> got it
[10:20:26] <overburn> hey guys, anyone have any idea about how to use data tables?
[10:20:46] <overburn> i am trying to use them but whenever I try to order, change page, etc, the request is made , returned correctly, but it's not updating
[10:21:12] <mintux> why it doesn't work ?  $("#my-alert").fadeOut('slow').alert('something');
[10:21:39] <mintux> i want when fadeout done for example alert happen or another function
[10:22:07] <mintux> $("#my-close").click(function(){
[10:22:07] <mintux>         $("#my-alert").fadeOut('slow').alert('something');
[10:22:08] <mintux>      });
[10:22:34] <_rgn> you don't understand what you're doing
[10:22:50] * jedimind 's shocked
[10:23:04] <_rgn> .fadeOut( [duration ] [, complete ] )
[10:23:12] <_rgn> complete -- A function to call once the animation is complete
[10:23:14] <mintux> oh thanks
[10:23:46] <mintux> worked
[10:28:39] <rdldew> I'm running out of ideas. I've created a plugin that will duplicate items based on what the user chooses as a selector. It will paste the duplicated node to a default location and append an int to keep track of how many nodes have been added. I'm trying to figure out how to remove the last duplicated item within my plugin.
[10:28:40] <rdldew> http://pastebin.com/Y0Ut773M
[10:28:45] <rdldew> Any thoughts would be awesome
[10:29:46] <benlieb> how can I get the 'this' when inside an ajax callback? https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/6597640
[10:36:33] <mintux> _rgn: another problem occur please see this image http://www.uploadax.com/images/99948453071955024958.jpg  i have some message that i want to show in one box each message close another message open in that place . so i using an array and when first message fadeout and next message show close button doesn't work anymore to run $("#my-close").click( ...

[10:38:41] <vladikoff> jop008, anyone is
[10:39:34] <mintux>  _rgn:  i copied my code here http://codepad.org/d9zgpA5A
[10:39:35] <jop008> maybe you?
[10:40:04] <mintux> how can i change my code to work ?
[10:42:50] <mintux> another problem occur please see this image http://www.uploadax.com/images/99948453071955024958.jpg  i have some message that i want to show in one box each message close another message open in that place . so i using an array and when first message fadeout and next message show close button doesn't work anymore to run $("#my-close").click( ...  i copied my code here http://codepad.org/d9zgpA5A
[10:48:20] <LoneSoldier728> ok so
[10:48:20] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/eKJ2gXK3
[10:48:22] <LoneSoldier728> this works
[10:48:37] <LoneSoldier728> but it seems to have a problem removing the class
[10:48:48] <LoneSoldier728> since the checkedIt variable just accumulates
[10:48:53] <LoneSoldier728> if multiple items are checked
[10:49:12] <jop008> I want for the required fields a * next to the label based on the style required how2do this?
[10:49:42] <LoneSoldier728> this doesnt work <label> * </label>
[10:50:30] <ravenzz> jop008 how does your markup looks like?
[10:50:34] <mintux> i put event.preventDefault();
[10:50:35] <mintux>         $("#my-close").trigger('click');
[10:50:47] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/79Bdy/
[10:50:48] <mintux> click doesn't work :-(
[10:51:02] <LoneSoldier728> jpop
[10:51:05] <LoneSoldier728> it works there
[10:51:12] <LoneSoldier728> jop*
[10:51:24] <jop008> Now standard <field contain> <label> input
[10:51:30] <mintux> after fadeout click event doesn't work on my element see this http://www.uploadax.com/images/99948453071955024958.jpg
[10:51:34] <jop008> standard example usage
[10:53:24] <jop008> the star after the label and now based on the class required
[10:55:25] <mintux> after fadeout complete the click event doesn't work anymore on that element run fadeout . is there any way to change everything to first after fadeout done ?
[10:56:16] <NoiseEee> mintux: learn to make JS Fiddles.
[10:56:26] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know why the remove class is not working here
[10:56:28] <mintux> ok
[10:56:32] <mintux> i make it now
[10:56:43] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/eKJ2gXK3
[10:58:53] <Syrit> may be this is not the right chanel to ask this, but i am pretty sure someone knows the answer ! why if i don't set the type for a button , it submits my form ?!
[10:59:56] <KWhat_Work> wat is this.$el
[11:03:42] <blindMoe> KWhat_Work: looks like a plugin that is setting $el on init
[11:04:31] <jop008> Must I make a loop on all input fields test the class reuired and then change the style of the label and put a * after the label?
[11:04:43] <jop008> for showing the required fields
[11:06:26] <mintux> i made it here http://jsfiddle.net/CsqsH/  i  want close button work after fadeout but it works once . it's not my real script but i have this problem here some html generate dynamically that i want same jequry code work for each copy of it
[11:07:27] <mintux>  NoiseEee: ^
[11:07:57] <BillCriswell> Wonder if anyone has done "Webdeveloper Cards", like as baseball cards.
[11:10:35] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/CsqsH/1/ @ mintux
[11:11:31] <mintux> hmmm
[11:11:38] <mintux> NoiseEee: thanks
[11:11:49] <NoiseEee> mintux: long story short - by setting the observer on #box, it makes sure that any button will fire that event when a button is clicked within it
[11:11:52] <mintux> NoiseEee: button means button inside #box ?
[11:12:33] <NoiseEee> mintux: yes, the problem with your first version was that you were watching only the element that was present at page load, then it was erased; now you're watching the parent container
[11:12:50] <mintux> hmm
[11:14:32] <mintux> NoiseEee: i can use button[id=my-close] for make safer
[11:14:44] <NoiseEee> mintux: i'd add a class.
[11:15:02] <mintux> hmm
[11:15:03] <NoiseEee> <button class='closer'>
[11:15:16] <NoiseEee> i don't like the idea of adding/removing an element with the same ID.
[11:15:18] <mintux> it's better than use id?
[11:15:20] <NoiseEee> but thats just personal
[11:15:31] <mintux> ok thanks
[11:27:26] <LoneSoldier728> does it make sense that when I have a checkbox checked
[11:27:32] <LoneSoldier728> the checked value does not appear on the input field
[11:28:52] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: unless you've written your script to do that, it doesn't happen
[11:29:25] <boytoy_> How do you do, I got this function at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/15/ (checkLastChild) which is suppose to check whether the last child is a <div> or an <a>, but right now it seems to think it's both, can anybody tell why?
[11:29:27] <LoneSoldier728> ah ok so how do i add it in
[11:29:32] <LoneSoldier728> through jquery
[11:29:38] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/eKJ2gXK3
[11:29:42] <LoneSoldier728> that is my current code
[11:30:25] <LoneSoldier728> the problem I am having right now is that the class is not removed because the length changes if there are multiple items checked
[11:42:54] <LoneSoldier728> when it comes to programming on the front end, what is a challenging thing to program
[11:42:58] <boytoy_> ooooooooh baby!!
[11:43:32] <boytoy_> told yall jogging would freshen up the mind :p
[11:43:37] <boytoy_> *booty dance*
[11:44:23] <doug65536> boytoy_: what is your definition of "last child". what is the "last" leaf on a tree? it doesn't make a lot of sense
[11:45:03] <doug65536> the last child of the last child would make more sense
[11:46:34] <Tingle> is there a better way to do this? I have this section at the bottom of my body section, http://hastebin.com/mehefagohu.xml its to load jquery with a fallback and then load dependent scripts after - document.write() would do what I want with less code considering it does wait and load, but I keep getting told to use DOM methods - also I heard that I should just use a local jquery version instead the google api
[11:46:34] <Tingle>  CDN one because people dont have it anyway most of the time...?
[11:46:44] <boytoy_> doug65536: i think the problem is that i didnt properly account for the fact that each list is split into two batches, one .visible and one .invisible
[11:47:08] <boytoy_> one sec ill share the fixed version
[11:48:21] <LoneSoldier728> how do i check if a class exists on an element?
[11:48:46] <_rgn> LoneSoldier728: google jquery has class
[11:48:48] <Tingle> hasClass
[11:50:31] <LoneSoldier728> thanks!
[11:51:20] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here currently working as a js developer somewhere?
[11:51:43] <Velveeta> i would imagine most of us are
[11:51:51] <Velveeta> but i have nothing to base that on
[11:51:58] <LoneSoldier728> Are you velveeta?
[11:52:02] <Velveeta> yes
[11:52:08] <LoneSoldier728> do you mind if I pm u?
[11:52:16] <Velveeta> go for it
[11:53:42] <Tingle> Velveeta?
[11:54:02] <Velveeta> yep
[11:54:05] <Tingle> think you could check out what I wrote
[11:54:15] <Tingle> couple scrolls up
[11:54:15] <Velveeta> where at?
[11:54:24] <Tingle> 20:46
[11:56:18] <Velveeta> so, you're just asking questions about how to load jquery?
[11:56:48] <Tingle> mm yeah, best practice - if it realy use DOM methods or document.write() and if to use local or google CDN
[11:57:01] <BillCriswell> Velveeta, Velveeta, Velveeta shells and cheeese.
[11:57:18] <Velveeta> i wouldn't use document.write myself
[11:57:26] <Tingle> k, out of what reason
[11:57:30] <doug65536> Tingle: you probably want one more onload on the dependent files, so you can "wait" for those to load too
[11:57:50] <Velveeta> because i think it's ugly for one thing, and because if they're loading synchronously, it doesn't save anything over embedding a script tag
[11:58:02] <Johnny5th> hey guys! anyone know how to keep jquery mobile from scrolling down to hide the address bar? I'm trying to make my ios smart app banner appear
[11:58:56] <Tingle> yes, but I'm wanting to fallback on my local copy if the google api is missing
[11:59:11] <Tingle> so I need to load it if window.jQuery is false
[11:59:25] <Velveeta> but google's should never be missing, they have more reliable uptime than your service ever will
[12:00:15] <Tingle> mm, just following this best practices page
[12:00:18] <Tingle> http://www.tipsfromsiliconvalley.com/2013/06/17/jquery-guide-10-best-practices-with-jquery-1-7-for-front-end-developers/
[12:00:22] <doug65536> why does everyone let google spy on their site? I can't understand why milliseconds on the first load is worth that
[12:00:44] <Velveeta> i don't personally use cdn to deploy our libraries, we host them locally
[12:00:55] <grafi> well Velveeta google was out in the recent past and not only for a couple of seconds ^^
[12:01:10] <Tingle> k the Ill host mine localy as well...
[12:01:13] <Velveeta> the one thing i can see as a plus for the cdn deployment is that sites can have it precached from having pulled it down previously from some other site using the cdn
[12:01:14] <doug65536> google doesn't provide the cdn out of the goodness of their heart. they track everybody
[12:01:20] <grafi> so I guess you are not doing something wrong providing a backup solution
[12:01:33] <grafi> doug65536 everyone does
[12:01:42] <grafi> we are the product
[12:01:43] <grafi> ;)
[12:02:20] <Tingle> yeah Velveeta, thats my thought - ppl that already have it cached wont need to redownload it
[12:02:34] <Velveeta> but doug does have a point about a few milliseconds
[12:02:45] <Velveeta> given today's connection speeds, that's really about all you're saving
[12:02:51] <Tingle> mm k
[12:02:56] <doug65536> Tingle: the first time they touch your site, it will cache yours. then it will be just as fast
[12:02:57] <Tingle> so I was wondering another thing
[12:02:58] <boytoy_> praise the lord y'all!!
[12:03:08] <boytoy_> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/18/ i cant believe i managed to solve this on my own :p
[12:03:45] <boytoy_> err http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/19/
[12:03:57] <Tingle> if I have like 2 <scripts> that are non-async, they will load after eachother and now the 3rd and 4th <script> is async (html5) - will it load A B and then C&D or would it load A&C&D B
[12:04:12] <doug65536> Tingle: what you did is a good exercise though - you have the core part of an asynchronous module loader there
[12:04:15] <Velveeta> it would load 1, 2, 3/4
[12:04:25] <Tingle> ok
[12:04:37] <Tingle> thanks
[12:04:51] <Velveeta> if you really want to look into async loading for development purposes, you should check out require
[12:05:13] <Tingle> require?
[12:05:21] <Velveeta> it has all of the dependency management built in, along with functions to ensure that the dependencies are loaded before firing any custom code, sort of a per-module document.ready
[12:05:23] <doug65536> Tingle: google requirejs
[12:05:25] <grafi> Velveeta doug65536 is that still valid btw if my browser already has it cached, will google even get hit?
[12:05:37] <doug65536> grafi: yes
[12:05:45] <doug65536> grafi: it will send a 304 Not Modified
[12:05:46] <grafi> that seems redundant
[12:05:52] <grafi> I see
[12:06:41] <Velveeta> so i just finished watching this week's breaking bad
[12:06:48] <Tingle> then Ill just do
[12:06:48] <Tingle> <script src="./libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:06:48] <Tingle> <script src="./libs/jquery.MyLibs.min-obf.js" async></script>
[12:06:48] <Tingle>  :P
[12:06:51] <grafi> :D
[12:06:53] <Velveeta> that might have been the most intense hour of the entire series
[12:06:58] <grafi> true that
[12:07:25] <grafi> i dont know what I expected after last episode, but I did not think hank would get killed
[12:07:48] <NoiseEee> fuckin spoilers you guys
[12:07:49] <NoiseEee> wtf
[12:07:50] <doug65536> grafi: your browser says to google, "I have X.js and the date I got it is Y", google (stores the referrer and IP of client, cross checks against your last gmail login etc <evil laugh>) checks the file date and sees that you already have newest... sends 304 not modified response
[12:07:52] <boytoy_> heheh
[12:08:01] <boytoy_> yeah that episode took us all outta our comfort zones :D
[12:08:37] <Velveeta> noiseeee: i tried to keep mine generic!
[12:11:04] <grafi> good thing i have no gmail login ^^
[12:11:17] <Tingle> hmm, I remember adding this <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"/> to my project at the beginning because I needed it for some reason... I forgot for what :O?
[12:11:23] <grafi> NoiseEee if you havent watched it yet, fuck you ;)
[12:11:34] <grafi> also, dumbledore is dead!
[12:12:46] <shoky> grafi: not nice ;p
[12:12:57] <grafi> thats me
[12:12:58] <grafi> :P
[12:13:11] <grafi> never not not nice
[12:13:13] <shoky> surely it's not
[12:13:35] <itschrisg> Tingle: IE=edge tells IE to display the page in the highest mode available (IE 10/9/8/7/5); chrome=1 tells the Chrome plugin to load if it's installed
[12:13:45] <Velveeta> dumbledore WHAT?!
[12:13:58] <grafi> dumbledore DEAD
[12:14:02] <benlieb> How can I make sure that this click function is assigned to all elements that match in the FUTURE?  $('.btn.accept').click( function())
[12:14:08] <Velveeta> does harry know about this?!
[12:14:15] <doug65536> as an experiment, I let my sister be logged in to youtube on my account for a while...
[12:14:17] <grafi> i think he does
[12:14:18] <grafi> :P
[12:14:28] <doug65536> soon enough, it started showing women's ads on sites
[12:14:46] <grafi> well thats also very true for amazon
[12:15:08] <grafi> search something "funny" on your buddies amazon page
[12:15:20] <grafi> and he will get recomendations for years
[12:15:20] <grafi> ^^
[12:16:27] <Velveeta> well with amazon you can go in and delete the history it's basing your suggestions on also
[12:16:42] <Velveeta> i had to do that once when i searched (in an incognito window) for anniversary gifts for my wife
[12:16:57] <Velveeta> and then noticed it suggesting all kinds of similar items in non-incog amazon
[12:17:46] <grafi> :P
[12:18:00] <grafi> i dont actually find it annoying, when its based on my searches
[12:18:04] <Velveeta> so i had to go dig up some instructions on how to clear that out :)
[12:18:06] <grafi> better than random crap
[12:18:16] <grafi> what annoys me with amazon is when i buy something
[12:18:27] <grafi> and a week later they suggest similar items via email ...
[12:18:43] <grafi> i mean i bought it from them, they should know i dont need 2 mobile phones ...
[12:18:48] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:19:07] <grafi> and they do it everytime too
[12:19:22] <grafi> its freaking annoying
[12:19:26] <shoky> maybe they'll convince you one day
[12:19:40] <grafi> to buy my second phone?
[12:19:42] <grafi> and then what
[12:19:52] <Velveeta> one of the greatest things i ever saw was a screenshot of someone complaining on Facebook about "great, now i have Facebook trying to give me ads for gay stuff, way to push that agenda!" and someone responding with like "you‚Ä¶ do know that those ads are based on your browsing, right?"
[12:19:55] <shoky> a few tablets
[12:19:59] <grafi> they send another email "you bought a phone" here are twenty other phones
[12:20:00] <grafi> :D
[12:20:40] <grafi> like something on instagram and itll show up in your feed, thats fun^^
[12:21:15] <doug65536> yeah, or when you buy a video card or something, you get 20 other vendors that are selling it for less :|
[12:21:25] <grafi> :)
[12:21:37] <Velveeta> yeah, thanks for the info, where was it when i was shopping
[12:21:54] <grafi> its like the bottom shelf in supermarkets ^^
[12:22:00] <Velveeta> and what's the deal with airline food, am i right!?
[12:22:18] <grafi> tomatojuice ^^
[12:22:50] <Velveeta> if you say that 3 times, will a dead guy appear?
[12:23:01] <grafi> thats beetlejuice
[12:23:04] <grafi> or bloody mary
[12:23:05] <grafi> :P
[12:23:21] <Velveeta> or candyman
[12:23:27] <grafi> candyman?
[12:23:28] <Velveeta> i was beetlejuice for my wedding
[12:23:33] <grafi> does he bring candy?
[12:23:46] <Velveeta> you've never seen candyman? for shame!
[12:24:05] <grafi> i've seen themusic video
[12:24:08] <grafi> does that count?
[12:24:16] <Velveeta> i have no idea :D
[12:24:34] <shoky> benlieb: with event delegation e.g.  $('#mycontainer').on('click', '.btn.accept', function() { .. })
[12:24:38] <grafi> its christina aguilera, has to count
[12:24:38] <grafi> :P
[12:25:12] <Velveeta> doesn't sound horrible already
[12:25:17] <benlieb> shoky: thanks, I ended up finding that on StackOverflow. The jquery docs don't do a great job of explaining that...
[12:25:20] <grafi> :D
[12:25:32] <grafi> not=
[12:25:33] <grafi> ?
[12:25:54] <Velveeta> benlieb: delegate used to be its own function, along with live, it's been rolled up under .on now, i'm not sure how well the docs do at differentiating those use cases now that it's all in 1 function
[12:26:09] <Velveeta> keep calm and call .on()
[12:26:21] <grafi> i want that on a tshirt now
[12:26:27] <Velveeta> i have 2 of them :D
[12:26:33] <Velveeta> though one of them i got for my kiddo
[12:27:22] <grafi> keep calm and call mom
[12:28:07] <trappist> What's it called when you have "prompt" text in an input field, like "enter your name" or something, which a) doesn't submit with the form if it's left blank and b) disappears on focus or when you start typing... ?
[12:28:14] <trappist> question #2, what's the go-to solution for that?
[12:28:29] <blindMoe> trappist: placeholder
[12:28:35] <grafi> is it?
[12:28:42] <blindMoe> yeap
[12:28:54] <blindMoe> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_placeholder.asp
[12:28:55] <grafi> should have read the whole thing ^^
[12:28:57] <trappist> blindMoe: thanks
[12:29:02] <grafi> w3foold.com
[12:29:08] <grafi> fools even
[12:30:05] <grafi> the doesnt submit part takes a required attribute though, no?
[12:30:49] <blindMoe> grafi: what?
[12:30:58] <blindMoe> placehodler text is never submitted
[12:31:01] <grafi>  which a) doesn't submit with the form if it's left blank
[12:31:12] <grafi> oh, "with the form"
[12:31:17] <blindMoe> trappist: be warned that placeholder attribute won't work in older versions of IE
[12:31:17] <grafi> man im bad at reading stuff
[12:31:20] <grafi> nvm then ^^
[12:36:26] <trappist> blindMoe: yeah, got that off w3schools... also doesn't "fire" when I need it to in browsers that do support it, so I guess I'm looking for a js solution, which should be easy to find now that I know what it's called... thanks again
[12:36:43] <blindMoe> np
[12:37:56] <Velveeta> yeah we have a placeholder polyfill we use for older browser versions
[12:38:47] <ShackJack> Hi all - I'm having some difficulty sorting nodes via a datetimestamp with attribute data-date="2013-06-04 16:00:00" (timestamp, basically)...  Using something like the following: http://pastebin.com/Gp50CEPm  Any idea what I might be doing wrong here?
[12:41:26] <Velveeta> so that function is only going to return a 0 or 1 value, you should have a condition for -1 also
[12:43:32] <Scott0_> what's the best way to calculate the days  between 2 dates in js?
[12:44:27] <NoiseEee> using moment.js
[12:44:29] <NoiseEee> thank you
[12:44:34] <Velveeta> <highfive>
[12:44:37] <Scott0_> ?
[12:44:48] <grafi> NoiseEee is totally right
[12:44:48] <grafi> :P
[12:44:49] <NoiseEee> Scott0_: www.momentjs.com
[12:44:54] <Scott0_> its not for display
[12:45:04] <grafi> doesnt really matter i guess
[12:45:06] <Velveeta> it doesn't need to be
[12:45:15] <grafi> moment is fantastic
[12:45:16] <doug65536> Scott0_: simple answer is (date2 - date1) / 86400000
[12:45:17] <Scott0_> id rather not add yet another js file
[12:45:36] <grafi> maybe you can steal the function from the library
[12:45:37] <grafi> ;)
[12:45:39] <Scott0_> doug65536: what format do date2 and date1 need to be in?
[12:45:42] <Velveeta> well then, subtract the 2 date objects and divide by 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
[12:45:47] <doug65536> Scott0_: Date objects
[12:46:01] <doug65536> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[12:46:13] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know a way to clear your public feed activity
[12:46:20] <LoneSoldier728> on github
[12:46:48] <Scott0_> is there a strtotime equivalent in js?
[12:46:49] <doug65536> js> print(24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
[12:47:09] <b-ot> doug65536: 86400000
[12:47:46] <ShackJack> While we're on the subject of dates... I'm having some difficulty sorting nodes via a datetimestamp with attribute data-date="2013-06-04 16:00:00" (timestamp, basically)...  Using something like the following: http://pastebin.com/Gp50CEPm  Any idea what I might be doing wrong here?  ;-)
[12:47:47] <Scott0_> so I can provide string and have it convert to object?
[12:47:53] <doug65536> I memorized that 24 hours = 86400 seconds years ago :)
[12:48:16] <Velveeta> shackjack: i already told you one of your problems up above
[12:48:23] <doug65536> Scott0_: does it have to be a string? that can cause internationalization problems right?
[12:48:52] <doug65536> Scott0_: i.e. m/d/y y/m/d d/m/y etc
[12:49:13] <Scott0_> doug65536: I can provide whatever from php
[12:49:38] <Velveeta> if you use moment.js, it'll allow you to specify the format of the input
[12:49:38] <doug65536> Scott0_: the safest way to use new Date is (year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
[12:49:43] <Scott0_> can I use the ISO datetime format?
[12:50:19] <doug65536> Scott0_: you can provide a UTC formatted string
[12:50:25] <ShackJack> Velveeta: I'm sorry I didn't see anything pertaining strictly to me? This is about using moment.js?  Seems a bit overkill to do a simple sort
[12:50:26] <Scott0_> yeah
[12:50:33] <Scott0_> UTC isn't a format
[12:50:49] <doug65536> 01 January, 1970 00:00:00
[12:50:55] <Velveeta> shackjack: no, the moment.js thing was for scott, what i said for you was that your sort function is only return 0 or 1 values for sorting, it needs to supply a -1 return option also
[12:51:17] <Scott0_> doug65536: that's not a UTC format
[12:51:25] <Scott0_> UTC format is nonexistant
[12:51:32] <Scott0_> its a standard, not a format
[12:51:36] <doug65536> Scott0_: you want to be difficult?
[12:51:43] <Scott0_> are you thinkking of the ISO date format?
[12:52:18] <doug65536> Scott0_: you can call it whatever you want. I didn't invent javascript. it has a .toUTCString function, so whatever
[12:52:29] <Scott0_> doug65536: if by difficult you meant  concise, then yes
[12:53:57] <ShackJack> Velveeta: I think I understand; so a -1 if less than and +1 if greater than (0 if equal?)
[12:53:59] <doug65536> js> print((new Date()).toUTCString()))
[12:54:07] <Velveeta> rightio
[12:54:08] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[12:54:11] <Scott0_> doug65536: maybe they were confued when they named that method
[12:54:16] <Velveeta> my guess is that it's only partially sorting your array
[12:54:25] <Velveeta> the -1 return should take care of the rest
[12:54:35] <doug65536> js> print((new Date()).toUTCString())
[12:54:43] <b-ot> doug65536: Tue, 17 Sep 2013 20:55:17 GMT
[12:54:51] <Scott0_> GMT == UTC
[12:54:57] <ShackJack> Velveeta: Thanks - will give it a shot, I'm handy with PHP but just starting to delve back into jquery/jscript... Would never would have occured to me even 5 years ago to rely on it for sorting :-)
[12:55:17] <Scott0_> all that does is convert to the GMT timezone
[12:55:22] <Scott0_> thus the UTC
[12:55:40] <Scott0_> the format however is not "UTC"
[12:55:51] <Velveeta> yeah there's a lot more logic being offloaded to the client these days
[12:55:53] <Scott0_> which is why I didn't understand
[12:56:08] <Velveeta> i still say use the server for what you can, it's a lot easy to buy extra power for them, your client's always gonna be a black box
[12:56:56] <Scott0_> doug65536: so im not sure which formattign standard that adheres to
[12:57:20] <rdldew> Ok‚Ä¶ So my duplicator plugin duplicates a specified selector and appends it to a default location. How in the world can I get this thing to remove the last item created with the duplicator plugin?
[12:57:51] <doug65536> Scott0_: which is why I recommend using number parameters y, m, d, h, m, s
[12:57:54] <Velveeta> rdldew: is it the same container for all of those duplicated items to append themselves to?
[12:58:01] <Scott0_> doug65536: I hate doing that :(
[12:58:12] <ShackJack> Velveeta: I hear ya; as usual I'm under the gun and limited in options :-)  I think I had my comparos backwards; giving it another shot...
[12:58:28] <Scott0_> figured there weould be a standard format javascript can 100% reliably read from
[12:58:33] <rdldew> Yeah, the plugin will place the nodes in a default location, or one that the user specifies.
[12:58:35] <Ziber> I'm starting to play with the colorbox plugin, but having trouble getting the controls at the top to show up. Any ideas why they wouldn't be shown automatically?
[12:58:47] <doug65536> Scott0_: you read the MDN documentation right?
[12:59:02] <Velveeta> rdldew: so couldn't you just, at the time the plugin function is triggered, get options.defaultContainer.children().last().remove() ?
[12:59:16] <doug65536> Scott0_: one example given is October 13, 1975 11:13:00
[12:59:24] <ShackJack> Velveeta: Looks like it did the trick - thx; got some bad info on the interwebs :-P
[12:59:26] <rdldew> I think I tried that, but let me look real quick.
[12:59:49] <NoiseEee> Scott0_: this is why libraries were invented
[12:59:51] <doug65536> js> print((new Date('October 13, 1975 11:13:00')).toUTCString())
[12:59:59] <b-ot> doug65536: Mon, 13 Oct 1975 11:13:00 GMT
[13:00:26] <Scott0_> lol
[13:00:31] <Scott0_> your timezones are the same
[13:00:39] <Scott0_> all that did was tack on a GMT timezone
[13:00:56] <rdldew> Ah ha!
[13:00:59] <doug65536> it demonstrated parsing the date from a string parameter to the constructor
[13:01:02] <rdldew> Velveeta: I think that was it
[13:01:03] <Velveeta> shackjack: no problem, glad to hear it's working
[13:01:08] <rdldew> Thank you soooo much
[13:01:14] <Scott0_> js> print((new Date('October 13, 1975 11:13:00 EDT')).toUTCString())
[13:01:14] <Velveeta> rdldew: good to hear :)
[13:01:34] <b-ot> Scott0_: Mon, 13 Oct 1975 15:13:00 GMT
[13:01:41] <Scott0_> format stays the same
[13:01:44] <Scott0_> timezones change
[13:01:58] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/54/edit -- I'm using JS media queries (mediaCheck) to determine desktop/mobile widths for YouTube embeds. But how do I access that width ($current_maxwidth) from inside embedly()?
[13:02:04] <Scott0_> so UTC is irrelevant to the discssion
[13:02:25] <Scott0_> I was just curious what formats Date() accepted
[13:02:50] <Scott0_> this http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14
[13:03:01] <doug65536> js> print((new Date('01/02/03')).toUTCString())
[13:03:09] <b-ot> doug65536: Fri, 02 Jan 1903 00:00:00 GMT
[13:03:16] <Scott0_> 1903
[13:03:18] <Scott0_> lol
[13:03:35] <Scott0_> if no timezone is specified, it probably assumes GMT
[13:03:43] <doug65536> who knows what happens if they are in china and it is y/m/d
[13:04:11] <doug65536> anyone with a chinese local here to try it in browser debugger console?
[13:04:14] <doug65536> locale*
[13:04:35] <doug65536> or non-american date format
[13:06:16] <Velveeta> there are non-american date formats?
[13:06:19] <Velveeta> i keed, i keed!
[13:06:36] <doug65536> Scott0_: there's your spec: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14
[13:06:51] <Scott0_> so when I do date2-date1, am I left with seconds?
[13:06:57] <doug65536> milliseconds
[13:07:18] <Scott0_> weird
[13:07:20] <Scott0_> but ok
[13:07:24] <Scott0_> I can work with that
[13:08:13] <doug65536> locale won't matter. js uses that RFC to parse the string. it is in american format m/d/y
[13:09:15] <doug65536> m/d/y is the MOST nonsensical way to have dates. it is like writing a number with thousands first, then ones, then millions
[13:09:39] <boytoy_> doug65536: agreed :p
[13:09:44] <Scott0_> I write dates as yyyymmdd
[13:09:51] <boytoy_> who thought of that anyway
[13:10:02] <Scott0_> boytoy_: mercans
[13:10:17] <Velveeta> 'murrika!
[13:10:21] <boytoy_> did they have a reason?
[13:10:31] <Scott0_> boytoy_: do we need a reason to do anything?
[13:10:33] <doug65536> probably "sounds better" or some nonsense like that
[13:10:44] <boytoy_> hehe
[13:10:57] <Velveeta> denis leary would say because we got the bomb
[13:11:00] <Scott0_> if we don't have a reason, we create one
[13:13:28] <itschrisg> Probably because of the way we say dates: "September 17th, 2013". Now, why we don't say 17 September, I don't know. That would make more sense, and our officials are not known for making sense.
[13:16:06] <boytoy_> itschrisg: isnt September 17 the proper way now?
[13:16:22] <boytoy_> i hear they dropped the th
[13:16:29] <boytoy_> or maybe that's UK spelling
[13:16:56] <NoiseEee> why cant we all agree that dates are meaningless :(
[13:16:57] <boytoy_> which reminds me of http://spiffingcss.com/ *BLINKING LOL*
[13:20:50] <SpitFyre> Hello jQuery IRC, I couldn't find anything about jQuery support of IE11, is it there?
[13:21:03] <NoiseEee> SpitFyre: yes it is.
[13:21:08] <SpitFyre> Ok thanks
[13:21:25] <Velveeta> here's more info than you ever needed about dates: https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/6168031
[13:24:05] <boytoy_> Velveeta: im good thanks
[13:24:06] <boytoy_> lulz
[13:24:14] <boytoy_> shit i dont even know what day it is..
[13:24:17] <RadListControl1> is there some way to make $.browser work again?
[13:24:25] <SpitFyre> Another question: anyone know anything about Fancybox?
[13:24:26] <RadListControl1> in jquery 1.9.1
[13:24:29] <Velveeta> there's a jquery.migrate plugin
[13:24:44] <RadListControl1> hmm yeah I tried it..
[13:24:48] <RadListControl1> I guess I mean in production
[13:24:48] <Velveeta> which will both put in the support again as well as show you where you need to update your code to remove references to it
[13:24:58] <guide_X> I can't use migrate in production huh
[13:25:06] <Velveeta> you can as far as i know
[13:25:08] <boytoy_> If I may reiterate with a simplified testcase: At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/75/edit -- how come mediaCheck won't change $current_maxwidth to 220px for smaller screens?
[13:25:18] <guide_X> but then it'll spit out console errors..
[13:25:19] <Velveeta> but it's a utility that's meant to help you actually migrate away from those
[13:25:28] <Velveeta> there should be an option to disable the console messages
[13:25:30] <guide_X> I have no control over what's using $.browser
[13:25:34] <guide_X> ah ok
[13:25:38] <guide_X> maybe i'll just do that..
[13:26:19] <guide_X> do you know how?
[13:26:24] <Velveeta> ok, but it's designed for a reason, because browser detection for features is going the way of the dodo
[13:26:34] <Velveeta> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[13:26:38] <guide_X> I agree.. but it's not something I can edit.. I am calling an external wdget
[13:26:40] <guide_X> widget
[13:26:50] <guide_X> it's using $.browser and msie..
[13:26:51] <NoiseEee> guide_X: then use an older version of jquery?
[13:27:06] <guide_X> anything older than 1.9.1 isn't working with the widget, funny enough
[13:30:43] <Scott0_> doug65536: btw Date() handles ISO date format perfectly
[13:31:39] <gordian> what's a good way to keep from repeating myself like this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NLM8w6bA ?
[13:32:08] <gordian> basically i have some responsive js that fires depending on screen width
[13:32:30] <gordian> i want it to fire both when the page loads and it meets the screen width requirement AND if the window is resized to meet the requirement
[13:32:31] <Velveeta> break your resize function out into a named function and call it from both places..
[13:33:22] <Velveeta> you should also debounce your resize events for performance if you don't need absolutely-immediate feedback
[13:34:30] <itschrisg> gordian: http://pastebin.com/PZyJNdkr or http://pastebin.com/HQSLdxAB
[13:34:49] <doug65536> guide_X: the jquery.com site uses migrate! don't ask my why!
[13:35:03] <Velveeta> doug: it does? that's hilarious
[13:35:12] <doug65536> yes
[13:35:16] <gordian> itschrisg: thanks! think i prefer the second one!
[13:35:49] <Velveeta> second one?
[13:36:20] <guide_X> wow
[13:36:22] <guide_X> didn't know that
[13:36:34] <guide_X> yeah I muted my migrate.. not idea, but it works I guess
[13:36:43] <doug65536> Scott0_: I would check it on some lame browsers to be sure, but I think it'll work
[13:36:55] <Scott0_> I checked in jsbin
[13:37:13] <guide_X> kind of silly browser is depreciated... almost everything complains about that
[13:37:14] <Scott0_> is there an efficient way to test against browsers?
[13:37:28] <Scott0_> something like browsershot?
[13:37:58] <doug65536> Scott0_: I was going to say, try browsershot
[13:38:05] <guide_X> I use browserstack
[13:38:33] <guide_X> I wonder if I could pick the peices of $.browser out of older jquery and put it in my own library?
[13:38:45] <guide_X> and just use that where some old site complains about it
[13:39:14] <doug65536> guide_X: not a good idea. you should test for things directly, like the existence of methods, don't have a lookup table of assumptions
[13:39:41] <guide_X> that's an enourmous amount of unneeded work to go back through old sites, and fix it everywhere
[13:40:09] <doug65536> not "I know browser X doesn't have method Y" I mean, check for what you need. why are you checking the browser? sorry if I missed it
[13:41:09] <guide_X> well basically it's not that I am checking the browser, older code I maintain does that... usually isn't me who's written it, either way, it's really annoying to fix every instance of it, when I could possibly use a workaround like dropping in the missing peice of code for $.browser
[13:41:41] <guide_X> moving forward yes, it's better to check browser features, but it's not a good idea to go back and redo things which work fine
[13:42:11] <doug65536> well, they obviously don't "work fine" if you feel a need to do what you're doing
[13:42:35] <guide_X> well in most cases, I'm trying to add something new to an old site, then I run into this problem..
[13:42:43] <doug65536> are you saying it's still broken with migrate plugin?
[13:42:59] <guide_X> well I'm not sure..
[13:43:06] <guide_X> I'm not sure what the difference is with migrate
[13:43:23] <guide_X> I would perfer to just have it work (good or bad) whatever way it used to work
[13:43:24] <doug65536> if jquery.com uses migrate, I would call that an authoritative "yes" on whether you should use it :)
[13:43:37] <guide_X> instead of adding unneeded work and complexity
[13:44:12] <WarDekar> so I'm using jquery on a site and I have a Multi-Select, which starts at a default state of "ALL". when a new option is selected I want it to UNSELECT the "ALL" option but I'm having difficulty doing that programmatically to where it removes it from the select box
[13:44:15] <guide_X> for instance, I can't hunt it down in every library I use as well
[13:44:23] <Velveeta> you shouldn't have to do much hunting for that legacy code with the migrate plugin
[13:44:30] <guide_X> it's just not a solution to say "go fix every instance of $.browser you encounter"
[13:44:37] <Velveeta> its whole purpose in life is to tell you exactly where you need to go to fix those references
[13:45:06] <guide_X> it's a lot of work, work which I'm not supposed to do all day
[13:45:26] <WarDekar> i have this: if($('#group_whitelist :selected').length>0 {                         $('#group_whitelist option')[0].removeAttr('selected');                          }
[13:45:31] <WarDekar> but that doesn't work
[13:45:33] <NoiseEee> guide_X: "the way it used to work" = use an old version
[13:45:53] <doug65536> guide_X: you realize that it is possible to have more than one version of jquery at once on a page, right? it's not the most elegant approach, but it is not that bad
[13:45:53] <guide_X> in many cases, I have a reason I must update jquery past 1.9.1
[13:46:14] <guide_X> yeah I sometimes use noconflict, but things can get dicey that way
[13:46:57] <doug65536> guide_X: ok, just making sure you knew that was an option
[13:47:25] <guide_X> kind of looking for a solution outside of... "don't upgrade", "use migrate", "fix all instances of $.browser"
[13:47:52] <guide_X> I mean why not just have a script seperate which enables the use of $.browser? that seems so much easier
[13:47:53] <Velveeta> you could try black magic
[13:48:07] <Velveeta> because they're trying to deprecate the use of browser detection altogether
[13:48:16] <Velveeta> they can't do that without drawing line in the sand
[13:48:30] <guide_X> hmm that's a terrible approach for those in my situation
[13:48:37] <guide_X> there should be some kind of fall back script
[13:48:44] <Velveeta> they've been talking about it for quite some time
[13:48:49] <NoiseEee> like migrate, you mean?
[13:48:51] <Velveeta> so it's not like it came out of the blue
[13:49:03] <clime> hey, is there a way to find the closest scrollable element (that can produce scroll events)?
[13:49:27] <clime> with window being the last option
[13:50:24] <guide_X> NoiseEee: migrate is like a dev tool
[13:50:28] <guide_X> what do I do in production?
[13:50:34] <guide_X> it's like a debugging tool
[13:50:46] <Velveeta> they made an option for migrate specifically for production environments
[13:50:53] <Velveeta> in that sense, it's both a plugin *and* a dev tool
[13:51:06] <guide_X> but what is the difference from regular $.browser?
[13:51:30] <Velveeta> because they're in the midst of deprecating it altogether
[13:51:37] <Velveeta> because it's bad practice
[13:51:51] <guide_X> sometimes I can't do anything about it, like in this case, i'm calling an external widget
[13:52:00] <guide_X> it's not like I can remove the external widgets $.browser call
[13:52:03] <clime> i meant vertically scrollable
[13:52:21] <Velveeta> you can search for alternative implementations that don't rely on that kind of check
[13:52:33] <guide_X> I cannot implement that myself thoug
[13:52:34] <Velveeta> if you're not updating the widget anymore, you could edit the src directly
[13:52:43] <NoiseEee> guide_X: then we're back to "use an old version of jquery or use fucking migrate"
[13:52:52] <guide_X> I do not have control of the widget's source code..
[13:52:55] <Scott0_> js> print((new Date("2013-09-17 04:00:00 UTC")).toString()))
[13:53:00] <Velveeta> if you're still updating the widget, you can maintain an external override file and override selected functions through the widget factory to remove that $.browser dependency
[13:53:03] <b-ot> Scott0_: No output.
[13:53:12] <Scott0_> bs
[13:53:30] <Scott0_> js> print(new Date("2013-09-17 04:00:00 UTC")).toString())
[13:53:37] <b-ot> Scott0_: No output.
[13:53:41] <Scott0_> ..
[13:54:31] <guide_X> okay, and what do I do when needing to check the browser? some things cannot be detected without $.browser.. I mean it's just insane to remove this..
[13:54:45] <jedimind> why?
[13:54:55] <jedimind> why do you need to know what browser it is ?
[13:54:56] <guide_X> for instance, sometimes you must check for winxp/ie8 because, the video tag will not load in that browser, but will in ie8 on other os's
[13:55:08] <jedimind> so, check for video instead?
[13:55:12] <Velveeta> then you check for video support
[13:55:14] <NoiseEee> guide_X: feature detection, modernizr, yepnope, etc
[13:55:32] <jedimind> which is the whole point, feature detection, not browser detection
[13:55:39] <Velveeta> because it shouldn't work in IE7 either
[13:55:44] <jedimind> what happens if MS pushes an updated to ie8 to support <video>
[13:55:53] <jedimind> (however unlikely that is)
[13:55:54] <Velveeta> so instead of checking for IE7 or IE8 in winxp, etc, just check for video support in general
[13:56:24] <guide_X> well I mean, ie8 doesn;'t have video support, so it falls back to embed, but specific codec's aren;'t available in xp, b ut they are elsewhere
[13:56:28] <guide_X> I am left with no way to check that
[13:56:43] <guide_X> feature detection won't tell me what codecs the user has installed
[13:56:43] <NoiseEee> guide_X: this problem has been solved, please read comments
[13:56:57] <guide_X> only browser detection tells me that
[13:57:02] <guide_X> and there's other instances of this too
[13:57:03] <NoiseEee> no, you're wrong.
[13:57:28] <guide_X> i'm not... latest .mov codec's aren't available on xp only.. so how do I check that without browser detection?
[13:57:36] <Velveeta> we've thrown out like 17 different options for this scenario
[13:57:47] <Velveeta> you keep insisting that your setup is a unique snowflake that's never been encountered
[13:57:51] <jedimind> guide_X CHECK TO SEE IF IT SUPPORTS THAT CODEC
[13:57:53] <jedimind> IF NOT PLAY ANOTHER CODEC
[13:57:55] <jedimind> its not taht hard
[13:58:01] <guide_X> I cannot check.. there's no way to check that
[13:58:08] <jedimind> ...
[13:58:09] <guide_X> you need a html5 browser to do that
[13:58:19] * jedimind pats guide_X 
[13:58:21] <jedimind> good luck
[13:58:23] <guide_X> for instance, the browser must fully suppoirt the video tag...
[13:58:27] <jedimind> stop talking please
[13:58:33] <jedimind> you're collectively making this channel dumber
[13:58:42] <jedimind> please read the comments people have given you on how to feature detect
[13:58:44] <jedimind> learn some shit
[14:00:22] <boytoy_> yess!! i made it work: responsive embeds using jquery embedly (without having to involve stuff like fitvids): http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/77
[14:00:55] <boytoy_> i am so happy
[14:00:57] <jedimind> boytoy_ this video is boring without sound
[14:01:03] <boytoy_> couldnt have done it withouy y'all
[14:01:07] <boytoy_> jedimind: ha!
[14:01:25] <boytoy_> * without
[14:02:36] <clime> hey, is there a way to do "lazy jquery expressions" - expressions that are evaluated later then they are defined
[14:03:37] <clime> *later than
[14:03:45] <Velveeta> break them out into functions and call the functions later?
[14:04:33] <clime> Velvetta: ye, rather I would prefere lazy-evaluated jquery object
[14:04:46] <Velveeta> give an example of what you mean..
[14:07:39] <clime> Velveeta: well the function thing you suggested is basically the thing that I need but I work with a plugin to which I pass a jquery object (or string selector) but I want it to select an object that has not been created yet (and will be created later). I am just interested if something like that exists. I can go around the thing somehow.
[14:08:57] <Velveeta> that plugin would have to be written with that kind of support internally, there's no native js method of having an object be evaluated at a later time
[14:09:19] <clime> cool, thanks!
[14:09:29] <Velveeta> i've written stuff like that before, using deferred objects and string representations of objects
[14:09:43] <Velveeta> but yeah, the plugin would have to support what you're trying to do
[14:09:56] <Velveeta> could you delay usage of that plugin until the time you're ready to pass it the object in question?
[14:10:49] <clime> probably, but rather Ill just go for a specialized workaround, simple and good enough for me.
[14:12:26] <clime> Velveeta: well if that workaround is possible xD, don't know. Maybe ill use the way you suggested, or i'll modify the plugin, I have done some mods anyway
[14:13:34] <Velveeta> yeah, in code i've written before, i've type checked the variable, and if type object, use it as is, but if type string, look for the object reference in any supplied namespace, and if type deferred object, chain my code to a done function on it and wait for it to resolve
[14:15:29] <Technical_13> Which is generally considered faster, storing .length as a variable and using that twice or calling .length twice?
[14:16:15] <Technical_13> My testing has shown only Firefox and Safari have differences significant enough to notice.
[14:17:05] <Technical_13> Firefox shows variable way is faster, safari shows .length method is faster.
[14:17:51] <jedimind> what does chrome say
[14:17:57] <jedimind> cuz thats all thats important
[14:17:58] <jedimind> :)
[14:18:28] <Velveeta> <thumbs up>
[14:18:45] <Technical_13> Chrome was break even.
[14:18:56] <Velveeta> so, i just reference the length property directly when i need to
[14:19:20] <Velveeta> for one thing, it's a dynamic property, so if you cache it to a variable and then alter the array at all, that variable is now out of sync
[14:19:40] <Technical_13> .length had a slight overall speed error, but caused error messages.
[14:19:46] <Velveeta> if i'm dereferencing a deeper path on an object, i'll usually cache that for multiple lookups, but for single levels deep like .length, i don't bother
[14:20:18] <Technical_13> .length had a slight overall speed advantage, but caused error messages.
[14:20:30] <Technical_13> So, I'm not sure.
[14:20:52] <Velveeta> in general, you don't need to worry about crunching out every last use of cycles
[14:22:12] <Technical_13> We've been trying to speed up everywhere we can because end users have mentioned the script ran slow.
[14:22:42] <Technical_13> Most of that is various api calls, so we're struggling to speed it up a little.
[14:24:01] <Velveeta> are these slow script errors you're getting from the browser, or users complaining that it seems sluggish?
[14:24:32] <Velveeta> in either case, you might be able to get away with doing a setTimeout(1) on some of those chunks of code, especially if they're heavily manipulating dom, so long as they don't make for race conditions
[14:25:02] <Velveeta> so for example, you can precompile a bunch of markup, and then instead of saying myElement.append(markup), wrap that in a setTimeout function w/ a delay of 1ms
[14:25:35] <Velveeta> that way the compiler finishes executing the rest of the current program chain, and defers the more expensive dom insertion until it's completed, which makes for a more responsive interface
[14:25:46] <Technical_13> Sluggish complaints.
[15:20:05] <Scott0_> im not able to read variable set inside of getJSON
[15:20:25] <Scott0_> anything I can check offhand?
[15:21:37] <eddiemonge> code?
[15:22:05] <Scott0_> the variable name is 'value' so I get 'value' is not defined
[15:22:26] <eddiemonge> again, code?
[15:22:40] <Scott0_> or rather Uncaught ReferenceError: value is not defined
[15:22:51] <Scott0_> eddiemonge: I don't have anything setup
[15:23:04] <eddiemonge> then how are you getting these error messages?
[15:23:16] <eddiemonge> how are you defining value?
[15:23:28] <Scott0_> eddiemonge: in code that's not for anyone elses eyes
[15:23:35] <Scott0_> I would have to setup a test
[15:24:22] <Scott0_> I was just wonderign if the variable had to be global or something
[15:24:58] <Velveeta> well if it's being set inside of a getJSON callback, then it has to at least be defined outside of that scope if you want to access it later from outside of that scope
[15:25:09] <Scott0_> that's what I thought
[15:25:11] <Scott0_> its beena while
[15:25:32] <Scott0_> would I define that as var value ='' ?'
[15:25:33] <Velveeta> doesn't necessarily have to be global, but has to be from the same scope level as where you're trying to access it
[15:26:06] <Velveeta> yeah, or null or something
[15:26:08] <Scott0_> or can I just create a variable without setting it?
[15:26:14] <Velveeta> you can just do var value;
[15:26:22] <Velveeta> it'll default to undefined
[15:26:31] <Scott0_> ok
[15:26:44] <eddiemonge> dont expect it to have a value even if you do that though
[15:26:55] <eddiemonge> javascript being async and all
[15:27:12] <Velveeta> right
[15:27:27] <Velveeta> like you can't call getjson with your callback and on the next line after the call to getjson, expect 'value' to be set
[15:27:33] <Velveeta> it has to wait for its response to complete
[15:27:53] <Scott0_> but then inside of the getJSON in the condition of success, would is et the variable the normal way?
[15:28:19] <Scott0_> I set value both in the success and in the fail callbacks
[15:29:13] <Velveeta> right
[15:29:21] <Velveeta> just don't expect it to be available immediately
[15:29:48] <Velveeta> but that call to getjson will return a deferred object, which you can then chain a done/fail callback off of, and run your code there, which will expect 'value' to be set
[15:29:51] <Scott0_> ah so other lines execute while its still waiting on the response?
[15:29:55] <Velveeta> right
[15:29:58] <Scott0_> the ones after getjSON?
[15:30:00] <Scott0_> ouch
[15:30:05] <Scott0_> no wonder
[15:30:11] <eddiemonge> Scott0_: sounds like you want the .always() method
[15:30:11] <Velveeta> iep, they'll executie immediately while the client is making its request
[15:30:14] <Scott0_> I guess ill use the complete callback
[15:30:22] <Velveeta> execute*
[15:30:34] <Scott0_> wait
[15:30:40] <Scott0_> always is the completed
[15:30:42] <Scott0_> :)
[15:30:51] <Velveeta> right
[15:31:13] <eddiemonge> i feel like someone just said that
[15:31:20] <Scott0_> eddiemonge: someone did
[15:32:41] <Scott0_> actually I think I want the done callback
[15:32:58] <Scott0_> always seems to run before its done
[15:33:29] <Scott0_> unless that's identical to the success
[15:34:10] <Velveeta> done == success, always == complete
[15:35:59] <Scott0_> still weird, I can't seem to set a variable that's used outside of the getJSON
[15:36:23] <Scott0_> even if I define it as null, and the getJSON is successful, it won't set the value
[15:36:41] <eddiemonge> Scott0_: it does set it. you are probably just not accessing it right
[15:36:59] <Scott0_> im setting in success, and using it in always
[15:37:04] <Scott0_> what's wrong with that
[15:38:22] <Scott0_> weird, I checked and its stull null
[15:38:24] <Scott0_> still
[15:38:37] <Scott0_> its as if the callbacks for getJSON are enver even run
[15:39:14] <Scott0_> that and I check the same variable in the success and also in the complete
[15:39:24] <Scott0_> I get a value in success, but nothing in complete
[15:39:28] <Scott0_> or null rather
[15:40:04] <Velveeta> drop a couple of console.logs in there to make sure they're outputting in the proper order
[15:40:14] <eddiemonge> its really hard to help debug without code
[15:40:36] <Scott0_> Velveeta:  that's what I did
[15:40:50] <Velveeta> and it's outputting in the proper order?
[15:40:57] <Scott0_> yes
[15:41:08] <Velveeta> and the 'value' variable is declared externally to getjson?
[15:41:38] <Scott0_> yes
[15:43:10] <Velveeta> do you have 'value' also declared inside the getjson callback with a 'var' keyword?
[15:43:44] <Scott0_> yes
[15:43:54] <Scott0_> 2 different scopes beign defined?
[15:43:59] <Velveeta> there's your problem
[15:44:00] <Velveeta> you're redeclaring a local version there
[15:44:00] <Scott0_> so basically 2 different variables?
[15:44:04] <Velveeta> right
[15:44:13] <Scott0_> aso how come my values aren't adding
[15:44:19] <Scott0_> they are concat  :(
[15:44:27] <Scott0_> how do I add to values?
[15:44:47] <eddiemonge> are they numbers or strings? console.log(typeof value)
[15:45:27] <Scott0_> objects apparently
[15:45:37] <Scott0_> they are supposed to be values loaded from the JSON
[15:46:45] <Scott0_> eh
[15:47:00] <Scott0_> data.name[0]
[15:49:19] <Scott0_> lol now it's a string
[15:49:51] <Scott0_> how can I cast this as a integer or float?
[15:54:26] <eddiemonge> Scott0_: +value + thing you want to add
[15:54:42] <eddiemonge> or parseInt or parseFloat
[16:02:06] <Scott0_> eddiemonge: I ended up using parsefloat
[16:02:10] <Scott0_> thanks guys
[16:02:52] <Technical_13> How do I parse the number out of the following class="foo-bar baz-35" ?
[16:05:14] <Technical_13> .substring( $this.indexOf( 'baz-' )+4, $this.length));
[16:05:54] <Technical_13> .substring( $this.getClass().indexOf( 'baz-' )+4, $this.getClass().length));
[16:05:57] <Technical_13> ??
[16:06:03] <Technical_13>   
[16:06:09] <Velveeta> i would probably just do it with a regular expression
[16:07:50] <pixelpimp> 'foo-bar baz-35'.match(/\d+/g)
[16:09:30] <Technical_13> So .getClass().match(/\d*/); ??
[16:10:59] <hexacode> hey you guys. i im making a carousel and im going to be using .empty() to clear the viewport of the carousel, then right away, it gets filled again with different content...i want to know if theres a way i can animate it so that when the new content comes in, it looks like its coming in from either the top or the bottom, depending if you use up arrow or down arrow. maybe like a slide in from bottom and from top, but also transition o
[16:16:00] <Velveeta> before you go any further, read this site: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[16:16:25] <Velveeta> then if you decide you still need a carousel, there are animation plugins already available for things like slideUp and slideDown
[16:31:30] <aleray> hi, do you know any simple modal plugin for which I can pass arbitrary html?
[16:35:52] <clime> aleray: jquery ui dialog
[16:36:34] <clime> aleray: if you want to go fancy then magnific popup
[16:37:33] <aleray> clime, thanks
[16:49:31] <rosco_y> javascript newbie question:  How do I retrieve the values entered in my jQuery dialog?  http://pastie.org/8334532
[16:50:17] <Scott0_> is having a counter that counts at 10ms intervals going to cause perfornance issues?
[16:50:28] <Scott0_> loadd from my phone it seems to lag a bit
[16:50:31] <Scott0_> *loaded
[16:50:39] <Scott0_> but in chrome is fine
[16:50:54] <Scott0_> so im not sure about those with slow PCs
[16:51:08] <rosco_y> Scott0_: try it with 5ms, see if it gets worse
[16:51:14] <Scott0_> lol
[16:51:17] <Scott0_> is that a solution?
[16:51:33] <rosco_y> no, just an experiement that might answer your question
[16:52:02] <Scott0_> what are you anticipating as the result?
[16:52:42] <shoky> rosco_y: what do you mean?  $('#txtURL').val()  ?
[16:53:08] <rosco_y> well, I'm not sure at all, but if it made your percieved lagtime worse, then you might try 15ms, to see if the problem goes away
[16:53:40] <rosco_y> shoky: ty, that's just the id for an input box in which I want to prompt users for an URL
[16:53:58] <shoky> rosco_y: oks that's how you get the value
[16:54:32] <rosco_y> the input value will be available even after the diaglog is closed?
[16:54:42] <shoky> yes
[16:54:57] <shoky> closing the dialog just hides it
[16:54:58] <rosco_y> :) cool, sometimes things are too easy to be obvious :)
[16:55:06] <rosco_y> Thank you very much!
[16:55:13] <shoky> yw
[17:03:14] <V8Energy> is there some kind of jquery library that will help me parse the html page? for example i want to scan through the document and find any text that comes after "name: "
[17:06:00] <duch_kazatel> you can do that with plain old jquery, but it'd be slow.
[17:23:57] <doug65536> V8Energy: a quick hack would be var matches = /name: ([^<]+)/.match($('body').prop('innerHTML'))
[17:24:11] <doug65536> V8Energy: definitely not ideal but it would be pretty fast
[17:24:49] <doug65536> oops, forgot the g
[17:25:54] <V8Energy> doug65536: interesting. I will check it out. thanks. How is simply html() different from: .prop('innerHTML') ?
[17:26:10] <doug65536> V8Energy: yeah, .html() should be fine...
[17:26:15] <doug65536> wasn't thinking :)
[17:34:51] <frothnicator> is there a known method for getting a deferred into a state where it never resolves?  I have a case where the _exact_ same response from the server (byte for byte) results in a $def.state() == 'pending' on one invocation, and $def.state() = 'resolved' in another.  The pending one never resolves, so my .done() function never gets called.
[17:38:37] <shoky> frothnicator: not sure what you mean.. it won't resolve if a) it's been rejected b) it's not been resolved yet
[17:40:44] <fwhiffahder> i'm trying to make a jsonp request, but all i'm getting is some kind of information about the request. $.getJSON("http://civtrade.herokuapp.com/shops?callback=?", function(res) {console.log(res)}) what am i doing wrong?
[17:41:28] <fwhiffahder> does it mean jsonp isn't supported?
[17:42:23] <duch_kazatel> your callback is pointing to "?"
[17:42:28] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know where I can learn about seo
[17:42:57] <LoneSoldier728> and i am assuming that it is all done html side right?
[17:43:07] <LoneSoldier728> or is there a js component at all
[17:43:26] <duch_kazatel> for SEO?  Very little JS - google does very primitive parsing of JS, if they do any at all.
[17:44:35] <shoky> fwhiffahder: it's best to look at your browser's devtools network tab to see what's going on
[17:44:38] <duch_kazatel> and fwhiffahder that's not how you want to do jsonp.  drop the callback=? portion of the request URL, then manipulate the data using the callback
[17:45:11] <shoky> duch_kazatel: that's an ok way to do jsonp iirc
[17:46:00] <frothnicator> shoky: well, it's certainly b) then, but that's just it: why would the /exact/ same response from the server make only one stop?
[17:46:19] <shoky> frothnicator: i have no idea what your code is doing, do i
[17:46:47] <frothnicator> shoky: put differently, the problem is clearly in my code (because, umm, the at least 819 other people in this room would have noticed), but I have no idea how to debug.  I was hoping this was common occurrence.
[17:47:15] <shoky> it's clearly in your code, then show some code ;p
[17:47:46] <shoky> and about debugging.. put breakpoints.. like, where it's getting resolved?
[17:47:55] <frothnicator> shoky: heh, now we're back to the five hours I spent on this earlier today.
[17:48:41] <shoky> is this your own deferred object, or a jqXHR returned by jquery's ajax?
[17:50:22] <jimmy_birer> Hey guys, i have a problem
[17:50:32] <jimmy_birer> I use the jquery .on with delegation i.e
[17:50:45] <jimmy_birer> $("parent-selector").on('event','selector',callback() { });
[17:50:47] <frothnicator> shoky: it's not dying, it's never resolving.  the code boils down to this set of statements: deferred = jqXHR.pipe(function(data) { ... }; deferred.then( success, error );.  But the success function never gets called.
[17:51:10] <duch_kazatel> jimmy_birer that's pretty normal.
[17:51:24] <shoky> frothnicator: does the jqXHR resolve?
[17:51:25] <jimmy_birer> duch_kazatel: but it never gets fired.
[17:51:41] <duch_kazatel> jimmy_birer have some code you can share via jsfiddle?
[17:51:47] <jimmy_birer> yeah.
[17:52:00] <frothnicator> shoky: err, is that not the deferred object?  deferred.status() -> pending, no matter how long I wait.
[17:52:37] <shoky> frothnicator: is what not the deferred object?  and i meant, does the jqXHR itself resolve? not the piped "deferred"
[17:52:56] <shoky> frothnicator: e.g.  jqXHR.done(function() { console.log('jqXHR resolved!') })
[17:53:05] <frothnicator> shoky: oh ... I don't know.  let me go down that rabbit hole for a bit.  thanks for the new direction.
[17:53:22] <shoky> frothnicator: and the other bit.. what's in your pipe function
[17:53:28] <jimmy_birer> http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:53:30] <jimmy_birer> oops
[17:53:32] <jimmy_birer> http://jsfiddle.net/4uD4s/
[17:53:33] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:53:37] <jimmy_birer> sorry its a bit messy
[17:54:01] <frothnicator> shoky: have to figure that out.  I working with CanJS, and I haven't delved into that.  I've spent all day thinking it was my code, now I'm trying to look elsewhere.
[17:54:35] <jimmy_birer> see, the .on event never gets fired
[17:54:40] <jimmy_birer> the callback to on i mean
[17:55:15] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:55:19] <duch_kazatel> where's .gs-title?
[17:55:29] <tw2113> jimmy_birer, [19:54:46.667] ReferenceError: $ is not defined @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/4uD4s/show/:31
[17:55:52] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 I fixed that here - http://jsfiddle.net/4uD4s/1/
[17:55:53] <jimmy_birer> yea bro
[17:55:58] <jimmy_birer> select jquery 1.9.1
[17:56:02] <jimmy_birer> i forgot to select it
[17:56:07] <duch_kazatel> jimmy_birer where's .gs-title?
[17:56:11] <duch_kazatel> thgat doesn't exist anywhere...
[17:56:22] <jimmy_birer> .gs-title is the resulting element
[17:56:25] <jimmy_birer> from the google search
[17:56:27] <jimmy_birer> dynamically
[17:56:33] <doug65536> jimmy_birer: document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0] probably won't do what you expect
[17:56:43] <duch_kazatel> heh, that's your problem
[17:56:48] <tw2113> the .gs-title is a class on the <a>
[17:56:51] <doug65536> jimmy_birer: why not just append to head
[17:56:52] <jimmy_birer> yea
[17:56:55] <tw2113> as well
[17:57:02] <duch_kazatel> you still have to bind to an element that exists on load.
[17:57:03] <jimmy_birer> im not good with JS/jQuery
[17:57:08] <jimmy_birer> oh boy
[17:57:15] <jimmy_birer> so no jQuery on not loaded elements?
[17:57:20] <duch_kazatel> or bind it when that parent loads.
[17:57:40] <duch_kazatel> you could bind to the parent container for the injected content (if that makes sense)
[17:57:47] <jimmy_birer> yeah i understand
[17:57:50] <duch_kazatel> the parent element still has to exist when you bind.
[17:57:54] <shoky> or bind to e.g. $(document) if all else fails
[17:58:09] <duch_kazatel> but since you're using delegation you can change the contents of that thing and you're generally still golden.
[17:58:13] <duch_kazatel> or what shoky said
[17:58:28] <jimmy_birer> so do i .ready() on the element that must appear?
[17:58:36] <tw2113> the shoky has spoken <gavel></gavel>
[17:58:49] <shoky> i'll gavel you
[17:58:53] <duch_kazatel> no, you bind to a parent element that all ready exists.
[17:59:20] <jimmy_birer> *Makes love to shoky's brain*
[17:59:21] <jimmy_birer> That was it
[17:59:25] <jimmy_birer> the parent element needs to exist onload
[17:59:28] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:59:30] <jimmy_birer> in order for .on to work
[17:59:33] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:59:34] <jimmy_birer> binded it to document
[17:59:35] <jimmy_birer> and now it works
[17:59:36] * shoky braingasm
[17:59:46] <duch_kazatel> the parent element needs to exist when you try to bind to it.
[17:59:53] <duch_kazatel> if the element doesn't exist, there's nothing to bind to.
[17:59:57] <jimmy_birer> *slurps shoky's brain juices*
[18:00:06] <jimmy_birer> yea
[18:00:10] <jimmy_birer> so i binded it to document
[18:00:13] <jimmy_birer> it works perfectly now
[18:00:14] <jimmy_birer> ty guys!
[18:00:16] <tw2113> jimmy_birer, leave shoky's brain alone long enough to pay attention
[18:00:16] <duch_kazatel> np.
[18:00:22] <shoky> gimme back muh juices
[18:00:30] <jimmy_birer> *spits them to you*
[18:00:32] <jimmy_birer> have them
[18:00:47] <jimmy_birer> tw2113: i was paying attention to double things, evolved humans are able to do that
[18:00:47] <shoky> brainballing
[18:00:51] * shoky dies
[18:01:08] <jimmy_birer> multiple things*
[18:01:42] <doug65536> jquery devs are a violent bunch. just the other day someone got stabbed in the neck because their eye was twitching
[18:02:43] <shoky> may they twitch in peace
[18:03:22] <jimmy_birer> he should have kept his eyes on the gwap
[18:03:27] <jimmy_birer> instead of twitching
[18:11:06] <Galaxy_Stranger> I'm having an issue with $.ajax()  http://pastebin.com/HTJLnMSS
[18:11:45] <Galaxy_Stranger> the ajax call is successful and I can alert a hello world via an external success function.
[18:12:04] <Galaxy_Stranger> but when I try to change the contents of that div, it doesn't work.
[18:12:18] <Galaxy_Stranger> what am I doing wrongt/
[18:14:35] <doug65536> what's the "nice" way to attach an event handler to window.history.onpopstate? Just write to it? There's no jquery for that right?
[18:14:55] <duch_kazatel> Galaxy_Stranger success: function(data){$('#login_dialogue').html(data)}
[18:14:55] <doug65536> oops, I mean, window.onpopstate
[18:15:07] <duch_kazatel> Galaxy_Stranger vs
[18:15:08] <duch_kazatel> <div class="login_dialogue">
[18:15:28] <Galaxy_Stranger> oh, duh, i specified an id...
[18:15:34] <duch_kazatel> and doug65536 window.onpopstate = function() {} is fine.
[18:16:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> BUT!  It still doesn't work...
[18:16:24] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: ok, but if another piece of code tried to use it, I would clobber their handler, right?
[18:16:34] <Galaxy_Stranger> i put an alert in and it didn't work either
[18:18:57] <duch_kazatel> Galaxy_Stranger your success should look something like this - http://pastebin.com/FfR1VCzW
[18:19:36] <duch_kazatel> are you looking at your console?
[18:20:01] <Galaxy_Stranger> no, i didn't open up my console
[18:20:28] <duch_kazatel> i mean like firebug or chrome dev tools..
[18:20:36] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah
[18:21:00] <duch_kazatel> see how i moved the success method?
[18:21:05] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah
[18:21:33] <Galaxy_Stranger> comments shouldn't hurt anything, should they?
[18:22:08] <duch_kazatel> nah i just clean up stuff like that because we use git.
[18:22:23] <duch_kazatel> plus i'm just demonstrating a point.
[18:22:43] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah, i was just wondering becuase I'm leaving my comments in the actual code
[18:23:03] <duch_kazatel> that's fair.
[18:23:05] <duch_kazatel> just sayin'
[18:23:30] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/1/edit -- does anybody know how to replace the old and boring jQuery Mobile loader with the new and awesome NProgress (http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/)?
[18:23:56] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok, there we go
[18:24:03] <Galaxy_Stranger> the  alert works
[18:26:13] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok, let me ask you this.  using straight jquery, the inner html of the div gets updated, (right now it's blank, so I have to figure that one out).  but when I used "document.getElementById("login_dialogue").innerHTML = "WORKS" ;" nothing happened.  Is there some sort of scope issue there?
[18:26:46] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to setup a working fiddle for me to go that far ;)
[18:26:53] <Galaxy_Stranger> hah
[18:27:00] <Galaxy_Stranger> thanks for the help
[18:27:59] <duch_kazatel> err...
[18:28:01] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[18:28:10] <duch_kazatel> document.getElementById("login_dialogue").innerHTML = "WORKS"; doesn't work, right?
[18:28:20] <Galaxy_Stranger> correct
[18:28:21] <duch_kazatel> you're targeting <div class="login_dialogue">
[18:28:24] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah
[18:28:28] <duch_kazatel> not <div id="login_dialogue">
[18:28:36] <duch_kazatel> rather, flip that.
[18:28:55] <Galaxy_Stranger> wwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[18:29:00] <duch_kazatel> document.getElementById("login_dialogue") is looking for <div id="login_dialogue">
[18:29:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> DAMMIT.
[18:29:18] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:29:26] <Galaxy_Stranger> Christwagons...
[18:29:33] <Galaxy_Stranger> thanks for the help
[18:29:43] <Galaxy_Stranger> i owe you one sexual favor
[18:29:57] <duch_kazatel> hah no need.
[18:30:04] <duch_kazatel> we've all been there.
[18:30:06] <Galaxy_Stranger> yer no fun
[18:34:25] <boytoy_> lol
[18:34:37] <Velveeta> wait a minute, who's being no fun!
[18:34:46] <duch_kazatel> me apparently.
[18:34:47] <boytoy_> never heard that one before
[18:35:24] <Velveeta> i say we pick things up in here with a little 3-legged race team-building exercise!
[18:37:21] <boytoy_> haha
[18:37:23] <boytoy_> ill pass
[18:38:22] <clime> hey guys, how can you bind to submit event to a from that is not part of dom yet?
[18:38:40] <duch_kazatel> clime when making the form, bind to the submit.
[18:38:43] <clime> I have tried something like $(document).on('submit', function () {}); does work tho
[18:38:45] <duch_kazatel> OR bind to $(document)
[18:39:23] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(){console.log('Butts!')})
[18:39:29] <clime> duch_kazatel: ok it probably did no work for some othe reason. give me a minute
[18:39:57] <duch_kazatel> look at my version - you need to specify a second arg to .on and use event delegation.
[18:41:21] <duch_kazatel> you see the difference?
[18:41:29] <clime> second arg should be optional, right?
[18:41:48] <duch_kazatel> clime not if you want to use delegation.
[18:43:53] <Dysharmonic> I'm trying to make a rather messy cluster of (working) functions into a plugin, so that I can use it multiple times efficiently.
[18:44:46] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I leave!
[18:46:09] <clime> hmm i wonder what duch_kazatel meant. both version (with and without second argument) work. I have an error somewhere else
[18:46:54] <Velveeta> dysharmonic: sounds like you want the ui widget factory
[18:47:00] <shoky> clime: putting the 'form' argument makes sure the event came from a form element
[18:47:28] <clime> shoky: ok but there is not many other ways how to make submit event, right?
[18:47:34] <shoky> clime: otherwise i could do  $(document).trigger('submit') and trigger your handler
[18:48:09] <clime> shoky: okey, i that would probably wouldn't be what I want
[18:48:34] <shoky> clime: also using the selector there lets you put more than just an element type.. could be  'form.myspecificform'  for example
[18:48:54] <clime> shoky: ye right
[18:49:34] <clime> shoky: thx for explanation
[18:51:08] <T13> Flipping to mobile in a second, but posting a link to a fiddle here.  http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/G3LzF/
[18:51:41] <T13> What I would like to know is if there is a more efiecent way to do what I'm doing there.  Thanks.  Going to T13
[18:52:03] <Velveeta> write it in assembly!
[18:58:49] <Technical_13> lol Velveeta
[18:58:55] <Technical_13> You're so funny.
[18:59:46] <Technical_13> But really..
[19:00:25] <Technical_13> Is the any easier way than moving through the dom tree on level at a time?
[19:07:32] <sammych> agh, man. I have these sexy looking buttons in Chrome but in FF they're all butchered and ugly
[19:41:43] <rosco_y> Can anyone tell me why the javascript function I've written ("cleanURL") messes up my jQuery dialog?  http://pastie.org/8334801
[19:42:28] <rosco_y> It doesn't even matter if I use the function or not, my dialog doesn't work when the function exists
[19:43:16] <rosco_y> the dialog markup is splattered on my web page, and it doesn't "show" or "hide"
[19:48:21] <Galaxy_Stranger> k, I have a quick question.  The script I was grabbing with my AJAX call was a "return" of a string via PHP.  The data was not coming through and being displayed in my div.  when I changed "return" to "echo" - it worked!  Do returns just not work with this type of request?
[19:54:05] <sammych> rosco_y: you don't need the 'var' in the function argument signature
[19:54:22] <TylerWhitney> trying to figure out if an element has hover, found this on StackOverflow at some point in time and it works in Chrome, but does not appear to work in FF or IE, any thoughts on how to accomplish this? if(!jQuery('body').find('.vertProd:hover').length)

[19:58:07] <bjorn_> hey guys whats up
[19:58:22] <bjorn_> im having a little problem with ie10 and some jquery
[19:58:34] <bjorn_> well actually html/jquery
[19:58:51] <Rout> if someone can help me -> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2109940036 , i'm using this code, to send via ajax, some form data, but has a return. some like ('back 30 dollars in change'), how can i do this?
[19:58:53] <Rout> i'm only showing this static response Cliente Salvo
[19:58:54] <Rout> anyone can help me?
[19:58:59] <bjorn_> so the page http://hipstersandhamptonites.com/spirits/
[19:59:01] <Galaxy_Stranger> join the club
[19:59:14] <bjorn_> when i have the sliddown nav
[19:59:31] <bjorn_> the links arent clickable
[19:59:44] <bjorn_> but if i press the arrows on the sidebar they start working
[20:01:04] <bjorn_> also if you i do right click open
[20:01:07] <bjorn_> they open the a
[20:01:12] <bjorn_> but they wont do it on a reg click
[20:01:23] <Galaxy_Stranger> i don't have ie10 in front of me, so I can't look it up reliably
[20:01:36] <Galaxy_Stranger> but we have issues with IE10 DAILY
[20:01:45] <Galaxy_Stranger> does your other Javascript work on the site?
[20:01:55] <T13|sleeps> Issues with IE.
[20:02:14] <T13|sleeps> Should write a multi-volumn encyclopedia...
[20:02:25] <Galaxy_Stranger> very ture
[20:02:28] <Galaxy_Stranger> *true
[20:02:56] <T13|sleeps> IE doesn't pass the Turing test.m
[20:03:06] <Galaxy_Stranger> heh
[20:03:24] <Galaxy_Stranger> one issue we had is that our IIS browser definitions needed to be updated
[20:03:41] <Galaxy_Stranger> it's real retarded - if the server can't identify the browser, it breaks the javascript
[20:03:59] <Galaxy_Stranger> IE10 came out and our server didn't know what it was
[20:04:02] <Galaxy_Stranger> amazing.
[20:04:43] <T13|sleeps> I've got IE7 on my laptop.
[20:05:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> oh, Christ, I'm so sorry for you...
[20:05:23] <T13|sleeps> Ya know.. For seeing what my scrip looks like twisted up and broken.
[20:05:47] <Galaxy_Stranger> i have completely dismissed everything before IE8
[20:06:06] <T13|sleeps> I also have FF23, Chrome29, Opera16n and Safari5
[20:07:07] <T13|sleeps> I see Safari needs an update to 6...
[20:07:42] <T13|sleeps> I don't update IE.
[20:07:53] <T13|sleeps> That's too dangerous.
[20:08:11] <bjorn_> heys sorry got dced
[20:08:29] <bjorn_> yea the rest of the js works fine
[20:08:34] <T13|sleeps> I sure talk a lot for a sleeping guy.
[20:18:10] <Velveeta> it should
[20:23:17] <Batata> hi guys http://jsfiddle.net/jVRjA/10/ I have my files like they are here but I'm not getting the same output
[20:24:13] <Batata> I have JS enabled in my browsers so I guess the "Linking" is the problem?
[20:26:28] <Batata> any Ideas / sugestions I'm new to JS/JQuery
[20:27:12] <jenue> Which one is a good practice in jQuery coding.  "$" or "jQuery" ???
[20:29:40] <tw2113> jQuery will always be available when the jQuery library is loaded
[20:29:43] <tw2113> $ won't always be
[20:29:56] <tw2113> or at least not guaranteed to be
[20:30:53] <Velveeta> i use $ for brevity, but always wrap my jquery code in a closure and pass in jQuery by name as a parameter
[20:45:36] <Batata> hey can some one tell me what is wrong here http://codepen.io/anon/pen/lGekq? becase I can't get the menu working but in this site (codepen) it's working like a charm. WTF! is wrong???
[20:46:42] <Velveeta> if it's working on there, but not in your site, it may be some other piece of code interfering
[20:47:01] <Velveeta> try commenting out your existing code and uncommenting it chunks at a time until it stops working
[20:47:33] <Batata> no I got no more code it's just this
[20:47:53] <Batata> there is all the code
[20:48:20] <Velveeta> then i have no clue
[20:48:33] <Batata> I'm a n00b at this so I can be doing somethin else wrong but "what" i dont know
[20:49:54] <Batata> at first I taugt it was the "link'ing'" but i think there is no error in:<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js"></script>
[20:49:54] <Batata> 		<script type="text/javascript" src="funcionas.js"></script>
[20:52:09] <Batata> WAIT when I add <script> my code </script> to the end of the page it works WTF??
[20:52:56] <Batata> <script type="text/javascript" src="funcionas.js"></script> vs <script> my code </script> to the end of the page whats the difference?
[20:55:54] <Batata> Velveeta no ideas?
[20:56:24] <Velveeta> as long as you have that script in a document.ready function, it shouldn't matter where you place it
[21:00:05] <Rout> someone here?
[21:05:14] <Batata> Velveeta thanks that was in fact the problem XD (no Document.ready function)
[21:38:10] <jop008> How can I put a red star net tot the leable text see http://jsfiddle.net/79Bdy/9/ under place
[21:40:39] <jop008> Find it out like this http://jsfiddle.net/79Bdy/10/
[22:09:42] <jop008> If I have the input field how to get to the label?
[22:09:55] <jop008> .closest ("label") ?
[22:10:39] <jop008> My html is like this http://jsfiddle.net/79Bdy/10/
[22:11:55] <apexskier_m> jop008: in that specific case .prev()
[22:11:58] <apexskier_m> would work
[22:12:09] <jop008> okay thx
[22:13:40] <jop008> If I loop thru the lements I get this location lib.js:582
[22:13:41] <jop008> reqlocation lib.js:586
[22:13:42] <jop008> label [object Object] lib.js:589
[22:13:44] <jop008> tosee lib.js:582
[22:13:45] <jop008> input_tosee
[22:13:54] <jop008> so only a few with label element
[22:14:04] <jop008> console.log ( "label " + oinput );
[22:14:35] <jop008> and for instance tosee is in the same block of code but showing no lable
[22:16:06] <jop008> found some have no label :-)
[22:16:56] <rosco_y> jop008: I'm a newbie, but can you give your label an id, and then use that?
[22:24:11] <jop008> Yes it can done by an id but I want to loop over a form and get all the required fields and then change the label for it
[22:24:38] <jop008> how do you replace a node with another node?
[22:24:54] <rosco_y> oh, maybe you can use "label" as a selector?
[22:25:16] <jop008> <label</label> mut be <label<div</div<div></div></label>
[22:26:15] <jop008> I do it the other way around first requiired fields and then loop thru this and try to change the label
[22:27:42] <__equinox> hey guys, what do you use to validate an <input> tag in jQuery? I have an input box and I want to allow alphanumeric only on it
[22:27:49] <__equinox> and I want the validation to happen as I type
[22:28:19] <__machine> how do i convert a querystring e.g. ?p=45&h=abcdef into a js object, e.g. {'p': 45, 'h': 'abcdef'} ?
[22:30:24] <rosco_y> jop008: when you are looping over the fields, how do you identify the required ones?
[22:34:42] <jop008> by the class
[22:34:53] <jop008> clas=reuied
[22:35:27] <jop008>        oinput = oel.closest("label"); this returns an empy element
[22:35:28] <PhlowHome> __machine, it's not that tough to do, but you could just grab a plugin for it:  https://github.com/mattsnider/jquery-plugin-query-parser
[22:36:06] <jop008> how to test if the element is a valid html field now console answeres []
[22:36:24] <jop008> test for length==0?
[22:36:28] <PhlowHome> length
[22:36:29] <PhlowHome> yep
[22:36:37] <jop008> okay
[22:37:07] <jop008> so how to reach from input field to the label field?
[22:37:20] <jop008> I do an inspect
[22:37:58] <PhlowHome> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4844594/jquery-select-the-associated-label-element-of-a-input-field
[22:42:11] <jop008> from input field tot the label element must be done by closest I guess
[22:55:43] <jop008> closest "label" returns an element with 0 elements
[23:13:08] <slartsa> Could jQuery be helpful when trying to automatically crop <video> content of differing aspect ratios?
[23:22:59] * tw2113 runs into wild eval() 
[23:30:02] <LoveitSoMuch> Hello. :]
[23:33:26] <jangoh> $(".nav:nth-child(1,2)").addClass('Circle');
[23:33:43] <jangoh> i want to select 1,2
[23:35:09] <Cork> jangoh: $(".nav:nth-child(1), .nav:nth-child(2)")
[23:35:34] <jangoh> cant select at once? :/
[23:35:37] <Cork> or if you prefer $('.nav').filter(':nth-child(1), :nth-child(2)')
[23:35:47] <Cork> jangoh: that is how css selectors work
[23:36:03] <jangoh> aright buddy thanx
[23:36:33] <Cork> jangoh: a simpler solution might be to do something like $(".nav").slize(0, 1)
[23:36:59] <jangoh> .slize as nth childs?
[23:37:04] <Cork> opps
[23:37:10] <Cork> sorry *slice
[23:37:14] <jangoh> ok
[23:37:20] <jangoh> i will try
[23:37:20] <Cork> jangoh: no it is based on the resulting array
[23:37:30] <Cork> ?api slice
[23:37:30] <b-ot> Cork: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[23:38:01] <Cork> [hit1, hit2, hit3, hit4].slice(0,1) => [hit1, hit2]
[23:39:17] <jangoh> thanx you are jquery master :p
[23:39:33] <tw2113> Cork, why must people think they need eval in ajax?
[23:39:45] <Cork> tw2113: cause they are evil?
[23:39:53] <tw2113> ah, the napalm answer
[23:40:09] <Cork> tw2113: but if you want to send js through ajax, you have to use eval in one form or another
[23:40:34] <tw2113> it's nothing i typed up, just something i came across in a WP plugin that uses ajax for property listings
[23:40:39] <Cork> (new Function(source))() is just as bad
[23:41:04] <Cork> tw2113: well jquery uses that ^
[23:41:17] <tw2113> we can't all be saints
[23:41:36] <Cork> well it makes debugging hard
[23:42:22] <Cork> tw2113: csp is a nice way to get away from that habit :)
[23:57:45] <MrTrick> I've got to load some content, and want to return a promise to the caller with a different value than what the jqxhr gives me...
[23:58:08] <MrTrick> $.when('foo').done(function(x) { console.log(x); }
[23:58:46] <MrTrick> Will print 'foo'.
[23:59:15] <MrTrick> I've tried;   $.when('foo').then(function() { return $.when('bar'); }).done(function(x) { console.log(x); });  ... but it still prints 'foo'. Any advice?
