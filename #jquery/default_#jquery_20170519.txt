[03:00:43] <rocky12> i am getting border on top and bottom in light box.
[06:37:19] <original> Hello. I'm trying to get height values of various columns, but I get an error. Any suggestion please? https://jsfiddle.net/22Lqch47/2/
[06:44:37] <zenox> original, afaik, you can't
[06:45:45] <original> zenox: https://jsfiddle.net/22Lqch47/3/
[07:30:33] <Cork> original: .each gives you the raw dom element you need to wrap it with jquery
[10:32:35] <Keytap> Morning gents
[10:40:38] <taplar> aloha
[10:45:15] <reynierpm> what would be the best event to start a loader while I am sending an $.ajax request? I am checking here http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ but I don't know if always is the case
[10:45:32] <reynierpm> the idea is to start a loader while the AJAX call is being executed and remove it on success or fail
[10:45:49] <taplar> just start it before the call, and then stop it in the following callbacks
[10:46:14] <reynierpm> taplar, ok, makes sense
[11:00:50] <Cork> reynierpm: if you need to handle displaying info for all ajax calls there is http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[11:11:15] <momomo> when it comes to scaling a website from too much load ... how do one scale and place one server in china, one in usa , on in europe to provide a better experience ... doesn't all requests have to go at one IP first ? like does Facebook manage all their traffic using the same IP address? Facebook.com .. or can one say, if you are in usa use this server, ...
[11:12:11] <taplar> not really jquery related
[13:13:08] <Cork> momomo: like taplar said, not jquery but you can start reading here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast
[14:08:23] <taplar> it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood..... a beautiful day for a neighbor...
[14:08:35] * hlve slaps taplar with a large trout
[14:16:11] <taplar> :D
[14:31:01] <ar1a> hey! I'm trying to select every textarea on the page, which i am doing via `var textarea = $("textarea");`. But when i print it out in the web console, firefox just says <unavailable>. Is there some way i can debug this?
[14:32:15] <taplar> unavailable or undefined?
[14:32:31] <ar1a> it says unavailable
[14:32:43] <ar1a> ill pastebin my code hold on
[14:32:48] <taplar> what does it show if after that you type just "textarea"
[14:32:58] <ar1a> https://hastebin.com/petovakomi.js
[14:33:40] <taplar> i don't see anything wrong with that
[14:33:53] <taplar> what does it show if you console.log(textarea.length) ?
[14:34:26] <ar1a> 1
[14:34:33] <taplar> weird
[14:35:25] <ar1a> any way i can get more info from it? :/
[14:35:43] <taplar> i mean if it is reporting 1 then it's finding an element
[14:35:59] <taplar> console.log(textarea.prop('outerHTML'));
[14:36:16] <ar1a> that worked
[14:37:38] <ar1a> im not sure, i found a code snippet that works though
[14:37:42] <ar1a> so i guess it'll remain a mystery
[14:38:16] <ar1a> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10080841
[14:38:38] <ar1a> it's a tad slow but oh well
[14:40:51] <ar1a> thanks!
[14:40:52] <taplar> i'd almost be tempted to not go that approach
[14:41:02] <ar1a> :/ what do you mean?
[14:41:14] <taplar> i'd be interested in seeing an approach that counts lines and simply adjusts the rows attribute on the textarea
[14:41:37] <taplar> but that wouldn't take in to account word wrap, so blah
[14:41:38] <taplar> lol
[14:41:55] * taplar thinking out loud
[14:53:37] <ar1a> hm ok so when i load this page, $(document).ready doesnt trigger, but if i CTRL-f5, it does
[14:56:07] <Woet> ar1a: www.jsfiddle.net
[14:56:23] <ar1a> nah my pages arent just pure html/stuff because im writing a rails app
[14:57:58] <Woet> ar1a: just your test case is fine.
[14:58:24] <taplar> any errors?  doc ready should always fire
[14:58:24] <ar1a> dw, ill just find a different lib
[14:58:29] <ar1a> this is causing me lots of issues anyways
[14:59:01] <Woet> lol
[14:59:33] <Woet> have you considered maybe you're not doing something right?
[14:59:52] <Woet> instead of blaming it on a library used by millions and millions of websites
[15:00:08] <ar1a> no im not blaming it on jquery :P
[15:00:22] <ar1a> im having to USE jquery because this lib im using sucks and im trying to hack things in
[15:00:31] <ar1a> so ill just render my markdown with something else
[15:01:49] <Woet> i see
[15:07:29] <ar1a> ok so
[15:07:41] <ar1a> i need to add a class to all the image files on my page
[15:07:45] <ar1a> how would I go about doing that?
[15:07:56] <taplar> $('img').addClass('blah')
[15:08:14] <ar1a> do i need to wrap it in a $(document).ready or something like that?
[15:08:24] <taplar> only if it appears before your markup
[15:08:33] <taplar> if it is at the bottom of your body, then no
[15:08:37] <ar1a> apparently it is, because images arent having the class applied
[15:08:52] <ar1a> yeah script tags are in the header
[15:08:58] <ar1a> so $(function() or $(document).ready
[15:08:59] <taplar> yep, so you need the ready
[15:09:16] <ar1a> okidokie
[15:09:16] <taplar> yes, either one
[15:14:01] <ar1a> im convinced jquery hates me :p
[15:14:18] <taplar> don't talk about my momma that way
[15:14:24] <ar1a> haha :D
[15:14:48] <ar1a> console.log($('textarea'))
[15:14:52] <ar1a> prints <unavailable>
[15:14:59] <taplar> what browser?
[15:15:01] <ar1a> firefox
[15:15:08] <ar1a> .length prints 1
[15:16:13] <taplar> if i go to jquery.com in firefox and put console.log($('div')) in the console it prints the objects and "undefined"
[15:16:51] <jugglinmike1> taplar: undefined is the value of the console.log expression
[15:16:58] <taplar> right
[15:17:08] <ar1a> hmm
[15:17:17] <ar1a> well i think i've got this working
[15:17:20] <ar1a> its 3am i really want to sleep
[15:17:26] <taplar> you must be lonely
[15:18:07] <ar1a> awwww FUCK
[15:18:15] <ar1a> the jquery broke my markdown editor
[15:18:31] * taplar 's matchbox 20 joke was completely lost
[15:18:45] <ar1a> fuck it i dont need autoresize ill just set a default height
[15:24:30] <ar1a> hm, i click on the link
[15:24:32] <ar1a> and it doesn't work
[15:24:34] <ar1a> like, its undefined
[15:24:38] <ar1a> half the time the image has the class applied
[15:24:42] <ar1a> half the time it doesnt
[15:24:53] <taplar> are you loading images with ajax?
[15:25:02] <ar1a> <img>
[15:25:16] <taplar> i mean are you at any point building your img markup with the response of ajax?
[15:25:37] <ar1a> um... possibly? i doubt it but it could be possible
[15:25:39] <ar1a> i didn't write the gem
[15:25:51] <taplar> if so, then the new img markup will not have the class on them
[15:25:59] <ar1a>  actually no i don't think so
[15:26:08] <ar1a> because the html is generated before sent to the client
[15:26:34] <taplar> ok, and are you using any sort of plugin on the images?
[15:26:43] <ar1a> no
[15:26:59] <ar1a> i think it might be to do with caching or something, because if i hit CTRL-f5 it works fine
[15:27:40] <taplar> if you crack open your dev tools there should be an option some where to disable cache while the dev tools are open
[15:27:55] <ar1a> but what about when its in production
[15:28:22] <taplar> in production your users should get the working version before anything is cached the first time
[15:29:01] <ar1a> ill launch an incognito and try
[15:29:12] <ar1a> nope
[15:29:17] <ar1a> image loads but the class isn't applied
[15:30:08] <ar1a> $(document).ready(function () {$('img').addClass('img-responsive')})
[15:33:07] <taplar> $(document).ready(function () { console.log($('img').length); $('img').addClass('img-responsive')});
[15:34:35] <ar1a> when it doesnt work, nothing is printed
[15:34:50] <ar1a> document.ready broken?
[15:34:53] <taplar> nope
[15:35:10] <ar1a> yeah that code is only run when i refresh
[15:35:12] <taplar> really sounds like you got something dynamic going on that you are unaware of
[15:35:52] <ar1a> quite probably
[15:36:08] <ar1a> well the URL changes, is there maybe a way to do that when the url changes?
[15:36:09] <ar1a> or something like that
[15:36:25] <taplar> url changes?  is this a spa?
[15:36:34] <ar1a> no
[15:36:40] <ar1a> thats why its confusing
[15:36:51] <ar1a> i go to /articles/1 and yknow
[15:36:55] <ar1a> the article shows up
[15:37:16] <ar1a> but i guess it must be loading them dynamically or something...... which is strange
[15:37:40] <taplar> is articles a directory?
[15:37:56] <ar1a> no
[15:38:10] <ar1a> its like an index
[15:38:13] <zenox> when coding, can i break long chains out to separate lines?
[15:38:20] <taplar> zenox: yes
[15:38:34] <taplar> and typically for readability, you should
[15:38:34] <zenox> do i have to do anything special, i get an error when i try
[15:38:42] <taplar> what's the line in question?
[15:39:10] <zenox> i'll try it again as i've always been put off by doing it
[15:39:46] <ar1a> all i can find is hashchange ev ents
[15:39:51] <ar1a> but the hash isnt changing :/ theres no hash
[15:39:55] <taplar> sounds like a spa to me
[15:40:04] <taplar> oh, wait
[15:40:34] <taplar> yeah, if it is a spa that translates /articles/1 into knowing how to load the page, then you only have one page load
[15:40:53] <taplar> transitions would not be a page load and the document ready would only fire once, not on each transition
[15:41:29] <taplar> which if that is the case, then there is javascript some where to build the images onto the page, and the script to put the class on them would need to run after that
[15:41:53] <zenox> works a charm, thanks for confirming :)
[15:42:02] <ar1a> well when i view source, the html is there
[15:42:08] <ar1a> i guess it might be put there by jquery?
[15:42:43] <ar1a> i put an event on hashchange to log, and nothing is logging
[15:43:35] <ar1a> hold on lemme test this
[15:44:52] <ar1a> https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks its this
[15:45:58] <taplar> "Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster. Get the performance benefits of a single-page application without the added complexity of a client-side JavaScript framework"
[15:46:03] <ar1a> yup
[15:46:08] <ar1a> comes default with rails .-.
[15:46:40] <taplar> yeah, so it's sounds like it's a pseudo-spa framework
[15:46:41] <ar1a> which means its as easy as
[15:46:45] <ar1a> document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", function() {
[15:46:50] <taplar> it make ajax requests to get the body, and swaps them out
[15:46:56] <taplar> so there is only one page load
[15:47:13] <taplar> which is why you are having issues
[15:47:20] <ar1a> n i c e
[15:47:22] <ar1a> fixed now
[15:47:26] <ar1a> thanks so much for sticking with me
[15:47:32] <taplar> np
[15:47:34] <ar1a> to be fair i had been googling for ages, i just tried new keywords eventually
[15:47:40] <taplar> heh
[15:48:40] <ar1a> fucking hell
[15:48:43] <ar1a> that fixed literally all of my issues
[15:48:46] <ar1a> ok its 4am time to sleep
[15:48:48] <taplar> lol
[17:56:29] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[18:00:20] <taplar> ikr
[18:00:29] <taplar> i've had to go to SO to get my fix with this biz
[18:08:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:08:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't blame you.
