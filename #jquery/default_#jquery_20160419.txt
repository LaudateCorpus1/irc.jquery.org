[02:31:22] <JWpapi> Can someone help me out handling ajax. I need an event that fires after everything else is completed, but ajaxstop and ajaxcomplete dont work
[02:36:33] <JWpapi> Im crawling data from multiple urls with multiple entries so lets say. I crawl 10 from url 1 and 10 from url 2 and then sort it based on scraped parameters of the entries. After all that is finished I want to put it out as list.

[07:36:07] <nielsNL> hi all. I'm trying to implement the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/lanebuckingham/SbCaJ/ into my own website.
[07:36:07] <nielsNL> Sadly the $('table').keydown(e) { ... } is not fired in my own page. Does Anyone have an idea why that can happen?
[07:39:04] <nielsNL> here is the page where i'm trying to implement the above: http://home.lumensoft.nl/rooster/admin.php  just hit "wijzigen" en try to use the arrow keys
[07:45:05] <Ernst_> hi
[08:03:51] <Cork> nielsNL: most likely cause the table is added after your run the selector
[08:04:03] <Cork> try using a delegated event listener

[09:32:10] <nindustries> Hi guys, so Im setting the value of a hidden input field on a onClick. Anyone ever saw that it doest change the value the first time, but it does the second time? http://pastebin.com/7MhrYMrm
[09:32:34] <nindustries> Line 4 executes, but line 3 doesn't every time
[09:38:05] <taplar> if line 4 executes, then 3 had to
[09:38:31] <nindustries> that's my idea
[09:39:00] <nindustries> it only does when I click #basicplan, #proplan and #basicplan again
[09:43:22] <nindustries> So that's why im asking here
[09:43:40] <taplar> i'm saying based on how js works, if line 4 ran, then line 3 ran
[09:43:57] <taplar> what are you seeing to make you think otherwise?  and you are not repeating ids in your markup, right?
[09:44:00] <dotcom> Are you a robot?
[09:44:48] <nindustries> taplar: yeah  exactly. I'm looking at it with my chrome dev inspector. I #bPlanText changing, but not #plan value
[09:44:54] <nindustries> I see *
[09:44:57] <dotcom> It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is. But tell me, do you like music?

[09:50:57] <nindustries> Im failing to create a correct jsfiddle for this
[09:54:33] <taplar> uh, i'm not sure what your doing but it looks backwards
[09:54:42] <taplar> i click basic and it's pro, i click pro and it's basic
[09:55:12] <taplar> wait, that's what you have coded
[09:55:18] <nindustries> oh
[09:55:19] <nindustries> lol

[11:06:34] <lignux> how can i check if a button is clicked?
[11:06:38] <dotcom> I am a programmer
[11:07:22] <mohsen_> lignux: Google your question sometimes
[11:08:20] <lignux> mohsen_, i did and i tried with this function here in the answer - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081608/jquery-check-if-it-is-clicked-or-not - but it doesnt work..
[11:08:49] <lignux> i figured maybe that now its on('click') and not just click in jquery it should be different since it doesnt work
[11:09:07] <neo12> how do you guys test to see if a string starts with a specific char?
[11:09:10] <dotcom> No problem
[11:12:26] <mohsen_> lignux: You can do: $("your_selector").click(function(){ //Codes here happen when the button is clicked});
[11:14:00] <lignux> mohsen_, is it different if i do $("#button-id").on("click", function() { // code.. }); ? Because that how i did the click function and it works but now i want to check if a specific button is clicked and if thats true make stuff happen
[11:14:00] <mohsen_> neo12: Google. but you can use startsWith().
[11:14:23] <neo12> that gives undefined
[11:15:30] <mohsen_> neo12: So? Its clear, your variable is undefined.
[11:16:36] <neo12> timeline-ui.js:34 Uncaught TypeError: count.startsWith is not a function
[11:16:55] <neo12> not undefined (my bad)
[11:18:37] <mohsen_> neo12: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWith
[11:20:07] <taplar> lignux: i'm confused by your question.  the click event handler happens when the element is clicked.  so there isn't a need to check if it is clicked
[11:21:53] <lignux> taplar, i need to check if its clicked in another function. Let me try and explain. I am using the open weather api to show my local weather. i call it with .getJson and i use the data in that function. Now when a button is clicked i want it to change some of the data from there but i cannot pass the data from that function (or i just dont know how)..
[11:23:05] <taplar> put the data on a data-* field that the other click handler can access
[11:23:17] <taplar> or a localized variable they both can access
[11:24:51] <mohsen_> lignux: No its not different, you can do what taplar said.
[11:24:59] <lignux> taplar, i just started with this yesterday and i don't really know what a data-* field is yet. I am doing the excercies on freecodecamp. Ill just try and work it out someway
[11:25:12] <taplar> $().data('key', value)
[11:25:18] <taplar> ^ setter
[11:25:29] <taplar> $().data('key') <-- getter
[11:26:24] <lignux> taplar, thanks that sounds good. Ill try and use that and see if it works
[11:28:30] <blinky_> hi people, I have a value like this - value="{'sensor':'one','state':'on'}" how do I select just the sensor or just the state?
[11:28:34] <dotcom> I am doing well.
[11:29:49] <mohsen_> lignux: Read also about global variables.
[11:32:46] <mohsen_> blinky_: Its an object, you can access the fields by their names, like: value.sensor or value["sensor"]
[11:33:06] <lignux> if i store a variable with data it brings back undefined.. i use $().data("test", variable) then $("#elem-id").text("test" + " " + $().data("test)); and it says test undefined
[11:33:14] <mohsen_> And something named google is also invented.
[11:33:31] <mohsen_> ^ was for blinky_
[11:37:58] <lignux> it worked! i didn't attach the data to an element before :D. Thanks people :)
[11:39:33] <lignux> i am wondering is this good practice for passing data as opposed to obj oriented style of passing elements as params?
[11:51:32] <nielsNL> Cork: are you still around?
[11:52:01] <nielsNL> 14:04	Cork		nielsNL: most likely cause the table is added after your run the selector
[11:52:01] <nielsNL> Cork	try using a delegated event listener
[11:52:45] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[11:53:26] <nielsNL> ^ a other listener for onClick works fine and that is just before the listener for the keydown is added.
[11:53:36] <nielsNL> hi all. I'm trying to implement the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/lanebuckingham/SbCaJ/ into my own website.
[11:53:36] <nielsNL> Sadly the $('table').keydown(e) { ... } is not fired in my own page. Does Anyone have an idea why that can happen?
[11:53:42] <nielsNL> here is the page where i'm trying to implement the above: http://home.lumensoft.nl/rooster/admin.php  just hit "wijzigen" en try to use the arrow keys
[11:54:25] <robertmaxrees> holy up.
[11:54:29] <robertmaxrees> hold
[11:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i can't navigate using the keyboard if you put focus on an input instead.
[11:55:45] <nielsNL> just play around on de jsfidle demo and then try it on the other link
[11:55:50] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:56:04] <robertmaxrees> i clicked a cell and it wouldn't work because the focus was put on the input.
[11:56:46] <nielsNL> yes you need to focus and remove the edit box
[11:56:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:57:48] <nielsNL> the idea is that you can change the focused TD by using the arrow keys
[11:58:06] <robertmaxrees> right.  so then your event binding is on the wrong element.
[11:58:09] <nielsNL> that works fine in the jsfiddle example
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> not for me.
[11:58:31] <nielsNL> but in the rooster
[11:58:33] <robertmaxrees> i click a cell and press an arrow key and the cell does not change.
[11:58:54] <nielsNL> just press esc first
[11:59:06] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[11:59:18] <nielsNL> so the edit line below the table disaperse
[11:59:24] <robertmaxrees> so are you dynamically creating the table dynamically?
[11:59:41] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[11:59:42] <nielsNL> nope
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:00:16] <nielsNL> from what i can see the keydown event is correctly added. but it is just not fired
[12:00:31] <nielsNL> when the
[12:00:48] <nielsNL> when i press a key.
[12:01:02] <nielsNL> maybe the table loses focus somehow?
[12:12:07] <nielsNL> robertmaxrees: something i also find odd is that in the example you see that the TD is focused ... that does not want to work in the rooster as well.
[12:18:27] <nielsNL> Eureka: i found the issue :D.
[12:18:38] <robertmaxrees> and it was?
[12:20:16] <nielsNL> in the jsfidle example every TD had the tabindex="..." property in it.
[12:20:37] <nielsNL> in the rooster i did not added that.
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> "rooster"?
[12:20:53] <nielsNL> ^ the second link ;)
[12:21:08] <decx> there you go, to focus arbitrary elements they need a tabindex
[12:23:41] <nielsNL> bummer they forgot to implement the tabindex="auto" option :(
[12:23:46] <robertmaxrees> "they"?
[12:24:03] <robertmaxrees> also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex
[12:24:09] <robertmaxrees> "0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;"
[12:24:17] <robertmaxrees> you basically have an "auto" option.
[12:24:26] <nielsNL> creators of HTML5 ;)
[12:24:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ see above.
[12:24:40] <nielsNL> cool
[12:25:11] <nielsNL> That is missing info on http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_tabindex.asp
[12:25:20] <robertmaxrees> w3schools is a bad resource.
[12:25:27] <robertmaxrees> mdn is far more accurate.
[13:00:43] <taplar> robert trashes w3c and the room dies
[13:18:31] <nielsNL> other question : in my table i have Th and td in the same tr. to scroll down the jtfidle example uses         c = currCell.closest('tr').prev().find('td:eq(' + currCell.index() + ')');  to find the same TD in the row below.
[13:18:32] <nielsNL> How can i change that so it works again?
[13:19:15] <nielsNL> ^ i mean scroll up
[13:22:45] <taplar> hmm?
[13:53:59] <asd20938> I'm trying to use the jquery mobile download builder to grab only the modules necessary for touch events, looks like the builder is broken tho (trying to access insecure http on a secure page)

[14:45:00] <Hootch> hey all, I want to make a little php & js page. Now I have no idea which JS framework mostly used in the wild? Any tips?
[14:45:32] <taplar> what are you wanting your js to do?
[14:46:07] <Hootch> mvc/mvvm, rest/json backend, gui components
[14:47:08] <taplar> in that case you might take a look at angular or something like that, if your after mvc
[14:48:16] <Hootch> Will jquery used as addon to server generated pages?
[14:48:41] <taplar> jQuery will work with any generated pages you include it on.  it doesn't care
[14:49:02] <taplar> it just manipulates the DOM.  doesn't care how it was created, :)
[14:52:03] <Hootch> Hm, and the latest hot shit is Angular? Or it means: "Use it, it'll be stable and get the job done"
[14:52:23] <taplar> it's built for mvc
[14:52:47] <Hootch> ok fine. i'll try it :) thx a lot
[15:30:46] <ShaunR> Is there any disadvantage to use $(document).on('client', '#selector', function() {}); vs $('#selector').on('click', function() {}); ??
[15:31:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd bind lower than $(document).on('client', '#selector', function() {});
[15:31:43] <duch_kazatel> but not really other than an under-the-hood check almost every time a particular event fires to see if it matches the given selector.
[15:32:12] <ShaunR> what do you mean lower?
[15:32:34] <duch_kazatel> $('.someContainer').on('event', 'element', function() {});
[15:33:07] <ShaunR> robertmaxrees: Ah, reason i didnt was because of content being loaded dynamically
[15:33:19] <robertmaxrees> you still want to bind as low as you can.
[15:33:24] <robertmaxrees> if document is the best you can do, then alright.
[15:33:42] <ShaunR> is there any performance disadvantage to binding higher?
[15:34:03] <robertmaxrees> not really?  it's more contextual though
[15:34:08] <robertmaxrees> easier to debug and understand.
[15:34:19] <robertmaxrees> don't concern yourself with performance until you notice a problem.
[16:53:34] <kevinde> Is there any difference between "" and '' marks in jquery?
[16:59:51] <pecg> Hello, I want to program a click of a button that generates automatically.
[17:00:11] <pecg> How can I 'track' the event of DOM changing with jquery?
[17:00:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want an event listener on a dynamically created element?
[17:00:56] <Demonen> Sounds like you want event delegation.
[17:01:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:01:07] <Demonen> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/  <-- Have a look, see if that's what you need.
[17:01:14] <robertmaxrees> and also: https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:01:16] <pecg> I already have defined rules for the button in question, problem is that javascript sentences (jquery in fact) are loaded, after the page is loaded thus have no effect in button
[17:01:38] <robertmaxrees> pecg which is why you use a delegated listener instead :)
[17:03:03] <pecg> Reading the docs, I begin to think that this is probably what I need
[17:03:18] <Demonen> It's just slightly shy of magic.
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:09:58] <pecg> Magic indeed.
[17:10:04] <pecg> This is just what I need
[17:10:09] <robertmaxrees> boom
[17:10:15] <pecg> Jack Torrance would be proud

[17:37:37] <robertmaxrees> have you tried using console.log() to debug it?
[17:37:59] <Sagar> oh yes it just sets the variables to all of same
[17:38:07] <Sagar> like id title etc
[17:38:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:38:14] <robertmaxrees> so why would that be?
[17:38:20] <Sagar> dont know
[17:38:57] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> id = val.id;
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you include the var keyword there?
[17:41:23] <Sagar> ah
[17:41:27] <Sagar> thank u!
[17:41:36] <Sagar> what does var do in here?
[17:41:36] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why that broke it?
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> you should ALWAYS declare variables with var.
[17:41:56] <Sagar> it wasn't global
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> actuially it was.
[17:42:08] <robertmaxrees> because you didn't declare it with var.
[17:42:29] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you technically have invalid code.  the engine then adds the var to the global scope because it doesn't know what scope you meant.
[17:43:09] <Sagar> oh ok
[17:43:16] <Sagar> so that makes it not a global
[17:43:20] <Sagar> and everytime $.each is run
[17:43:24] <Sagar> it assigns it a new value
[17:43:29] <robertmaxrees> *creates a new var.
[17:43:33] <robertmaxrees> because there's a new scope.
[17:44:14] <robertmaxrees> you were basically running each through everything before the appends happened, so it was whatever the last value was for those vars in the each is what was used.
[17:44:52] <Sagar> ok :)
[17:45:04] <robertmaxrees> js 101.  it's why i hard on having valid code.
[17:45:15] <Sagar> what if i dont declare var at all?
[17:45:21] <Sagar> and directly use val.id or something?
[18:12:56] <pecg> Well, I have a <button> inside a <td>, how can I efficiently tell it to get some a .val() from some inputs in another <td> from the same <tr>
[18:13:39] <cannap> has the button a class?
[18:13:45] <cannap> ah
[18:13:49] <Demonen> the <button> has a parent (the <td>, I'm guessing), that also has a parent. Climb the tree?
[18:24:06] <robertmaxrees> pecg give the elements classes.
[18:24:15] <robertmaxrees> then grab the tr by using .closest() and then .find()
[21:09:18] <acidjazz> you gotta grab that tr
[21:09:22] <acidjazz> just snatch it
[21:09:30] <acidjazz> snatch it up pick it from the tr tree
[23:15:36] <arc_> is there something like eq() but for a range
[23:16:03] <arc_> slice() ?
[23:16:15] <arc_> apparently so
[23:17:10] <funhouse> Hey there, so I have event listensers running, just wondering where they should be placed? Do you guys place them  in a seperate file, also should they be placed in the onready function?
[23:50:31] <R13ose> This code: http://pastebin.com/c1ajnSmX works, gets rid of the youtube video after I close the popup, on my desktop but not my mobile.  How do I make this work for mobile?
