[00:30:20] <Ayub> I need some help with jquery ajax form submitting file upload
[00:30:44] <Ayub> when response is application/json IE is trying to download the file..how can I over come this issue ?
[00:32:19] <Ayub> Woet: I am still facing the same issue of file download for json response..
[00:32:59] <Ayub> its working in chrome but not IE..I don't have control over the response headers coming from server..
[00:36:39] <Ayub> Its discussed here not sure what to do in my client calling code
[00:36:40] <Ayub> https://github.com/christiangenco/dbinbox/commit/5765d6a8c633e033450df8b5d569098dae3d63f6
[00:45:53] <Ayub> is IE 9 broken for handling application/json response ?
[01:59:01] <GoSox> I always forget, how can I find an event to elements that aren't created yet, future elements?
[02:00:22] <bacobart> GoSox: .on()
[02:03:02] <GoSox> what about setting the text that is selected? Not in an input, just selecting plain text on a web page via jq/js ?
[02:05:02] <bacobart> ehm i dont think you need jquery for that
[02:05:02] <bacobart> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.getSelection
[02:06:06] <GoSox> that doesn't sound like what i'm looking for
[02:06:20] <GoSox> although i'm not sure, because i don't really understand what that does based on it's description
[02:06:35] <bacobart> you want the text the user selected with his mouse?
[02:06:51] <GoSox> no
[02:06:59] <GoSox> i want to SET what text is selected on a page
[02:07:33] <bacobart> ehm ok
[02:07:35] <bacobart> idk if you can
[02:07:40] <bacobart> plus its weird :P
[02:08:24] <bacobart> seems like you can though http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4183401/can-you-set-and-or-change-the-user-s-text-selection-in-javascript
[02:12:49] <GoSox> i found that same solution on another page
[02:12:54] <GoSox> and i'm not liking it
[02:13:05] <GoSox> but i also have to go to bed so ill just forget it for now and revisit this later
[02:13:15] <bacobart> ok
[02:13:21] <GoSox> thanks anyway

[04:35:34] <masscrx> hi
[04:36:33] <masscrx> How can I detect changes on hidden input ? For example I have <input type="hidden" id="hiddeninput"> I know that .change is not fired up for hidden inputs
[04:38:27] <bengalo> dunno about direct binding but with delegation, it still triggers
[04:42:06] <bengalo> just checked on my site, not so sure anymore about the delegation trigger, im triggering the change event myself
[04:42:14] <bengalo> which is also what u could do
[04:43:38] <masscrx> ?
[04:44:59] <bengalo> well, how is the hidden input value changed in the first place?
[04:51:20] <rkrara> hello eveyone
[04:51:32] <rkrara> i need help with jquery mobile 1.3.2
[04:53:16] <rkrara> I have a div with data-role="page" class="main-dialog"
[04:54:21] <rkrara> doing a .val(level).selectmenu('refresh'); breaks the dialog and it appears as a page
[04:58:24] <bengalo> you can try .val(level).trigger('change').select....
[05:08:18] <d0de> How do I match the string "\n" with regex?
[05:08:47] <_rgn> google javascript match newline
[05:09:36] <Unopoo> I tried `return $(this).is(':visible')`
[05:09:36] <Unopoo> but didn't work, I want to know why, and how to do this
[05:12:00] <Unopoo> I'm learning from <learning jquery>, and here is a assignment:
[05:12:00] <Unopoo> add a new submethod called `isOpen` to check if the tooltip widget is displayed now
[05:12:00] <Unopoo> here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/HickHack/ds87wrLr/
[05:12:00] <Unopoo> I tried `return $(this).is(':visible')`
[05:12:00] <Unopoo> but didn't work, I want to know why, and how to do this
[05:20:09] <d0de> Unopoo, I'm afraid I have no idea what $(this) would capture in that particular code
[05:22:05] <d0de> and in the fiddle you posted, isOpen isn't being called by anything, so I don't know how to answer your question
[05:34:36] <Unopoo> in short , my question is, how to get a jquery object from a widget() instance?
[06:12:23] <abailarri> Hello. I have this code that works in FF and Chrome, but not in IE. It not appends the message. Anyone knows why?
[06:12:25] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/8jjtt721/
[06:14:15] <skullcrasher> if I add an icon to a submit button like following: http://paste.good-times.eu/index.php/BaJ/js
[06:14:21] <skullcrasher> how can I remove it again?
[06:14:29] <skullcrasher> submitButton.remove(spinner) doesn't work
[06:14:33] <xec> abailarri: could you make a demo that actually does something? #addFile etc doesn't exist
[06:15:56] <xec> abailarri: running the single line seems to work fine in IE http://jsfiddle.net/8jjtt721/1/
[06:17:03] <Unopoo> exit
[06:19:42] <xec> skullcrasher: try spinner.remove()
[06:21:42] <abailarri> xec, in IE11 not works
[06:21:45] <abailarri> my code
[06:21:56] <xec> did the demo work?
[06:22:30] <xec> i only have IE10 available atm
[06:23:19] <starsinmypockets> Trying to get the depth of a class... ex: .node .node <-- 2, .node .node .node .node <-- 4 for class .node
[06:24:51] <abailarri> xec, works http://jsfiddle.net/8jjtt721/15/ on my IE
[06:24:56] <abailarri> but in my real code np
[06:24:57] <abailarri> no
[06:25:11] <xec> abailarri: then something is different in your code
[06:25:31] <xec> abailarri: if you find out what it is, i'm guessing you've solved it ;)
[06:26:42] <xec> starsinmypockets: what's your starting point? like, if you want to find out how many parents with class "node" a dom node has  you could do $(someDomNode).parents(".node").length
[06:26:43] <abailarri> xec, this is my real code. http://jsfiddle.net/dud76pvv/ I can see the last alert (yes) then, it enters tho the if
[06:28:09] <starsinmypockets> xec - I want to examine the whole DOM and attach classes to .node based on the depth - your solution would probably work...
[06:29:35] <xec> starsinmypockets: may i ask what it's for?
[06:36:01] <starsinmypockets> xec a taxonomy tree with arbitrary depth - so I'd like to tiger stripe the levels
[06:37:12] <skullcrasher> xec, works perfect :) thx
[06:37:21] <skullcrasher> never thought of this simple solution -.-
[07:02:56] <DevAntoine> hi
[07:03:46] <DevAntoine> $.ajax fails to parse my json return if I don't specify the dataType, why? It's annoying because in one case the response's body is empty
[07:08:07] <dan2k3k4> how can I select: <label for="edit-field"></label> with jQuery ?
[07:08:21] <dan2k3k4> $("label[for='edit-field']") ?
[07:08:28] <DevAntoine> dan2k3k4: yes
[07:08:58] <dan2k3k4> uncaught error
[07:09:10] <dan2k3k4> hmm works with = instead of :
[07:09:34] <latestbot> @DevAntoine, I think it has to do something with your server
[07:09:36] <BillCriswell> dan2k3k4: What?
[07:10:19] <dan2k3k4> BillCriswell, I had correctly typed it in IRC but was doing for:'edit-field on dev console :
[07:10:20] <dan2k3k4> :\
[07:10:31] <BillCriswell> dan2k3k4: Oh ok haha
[07:15:13] <DevAntoine> latestbot: you mean the content-type?
[07:15:52] <latestbot> Not really, you’re returning a valid JSON from the server right?
[07:16:39] <latestbot> Unless you’re having CORS issues, there’s no need to explicitly set the dataType
[07:21:23] <d0de>  I've built a toy project that encodes ipv6 addresses as haiku. ipv6 addresses are 128 bits. Is there anything else interesting I could store in 128 bits?
[07:28:43] <DevAntoine> latestbot: yes, I'm returning valid json
[07:29:30] <latestbot> So setting dataType as ‘json’ doesn’t work?
[07:30:00] <DevAntoine> latestbot: if I don't set the dataType jquery ain't able to detect it
[07:31:29] <latestbot> So you would have to set that in order for it to work
[07:31:33] <mbrzuzy> did you try setting the content type to applications/json?
[07:31:36] <mbrzuzy> when returning
[07:31:40] <mbrzuzy> application/json*
[07:36:00] <Duvdevan> is it better to use $('body').on or $(document).on for event delegation?
[07:37:46] <latestbot> @Duvdevan: Use document
[07:38:11] <latestbot> if you’re using “body” jquery selector engine would have to search for it first
[07:44:55] <DevAntoine> mbrzuzy: oh, no...
[07:49:01] <kingfisher64> would some knowledgable soul tell me how to set a jquery fade in (caption text) for each slide. I've been asked for a fade in of text after x amount of time then again with a 2nd piece of text for each flexslider
[07:49:49] <kingfisher64> i had it working but only on page load so it only works for the 1st slide not the rest
[07:50:40] <jphase> kingfisher64: you'll need to call your fade in animation on the slide change callback for each slide
[07:51:14] <kingfisher64> yeah, i'm a newbie with jquery though... jphase.
[07:51:36] <kingfisher64> could you point me to an example?
[07:51:58] <jphase> kingfisher64: so look up their options, you'll see the events they have:  start, end, before, after
[07:52:39] <jphase> when you call the .flexslider({ after: function( slider ) { // Put your fade in stuff in here } });
[07:53:07] <jphase> you can start with console.log( slider );  inside there so you know what slider is
[07:53:18] <jphase> but read their docs
[07:53:18] <jphase> http://flex.madebymufffin.com/index.html
[07:54:36] <jphase> I don't have time to do it for you, but if you setup a jsfiddle.net with flexslider and such included and some demo images, I'd be happy to help you out
[07:55:28] <kingfisher64> thank you for offering jphase, that's v kind of you
[08:09:06] <kingfisher64> it's acutally the drupal module of the script so I'm not sure how that affects this jphase?
[08:11:02] <kingfisher64> actually there is already a fiddle setup for this jphase on http://jsfiddle.net/LQgw4/
[08:11:29] <kingfisher64> so good stuff!
[08:14:11] <kingfisher64> it's just the text fade in part of that fiddle I'd need. the image slider is handled by flexslider
[08:15:38] <jphase> kingfisher64: well if you want to integrate this with the slider then you'll need to change this fiddle to include the flexslider library and then use these functions in those callbacks that flexslider offers
[08:16:00] <jphase> as it stands now, this is sort of a "custom slider" type of thing with chained fade in calls
[08:16:13] <bourg_i1> I have a little question, I have a select with differents options, I show and hide them with an action and I wanted to know how can I select the first option that is display, not the first from the select
[08:21:45] <kingfisher64> is this any better jphase http://jsfiddle.net/3Hq7Q/1/
[08:24:27] <jphase> kingfisher64: yeah that's the direction you want to go. get the slides to show up and we'll go from there - I'm in a meeting atm but I'll try to help out where I can and there are several other nerdy folk in here that may be able to step in as well :)
[08:25:15] <kingfisher64> nerdy folk rule! jphase, where would the world be without them?
[08:28:00] <decx> you want your caption copied in a separate div?
[08:28:20] <decx> didnt you want like a delayed caption showing up after the slide the other day?
[08:31:41] <kingfisher64> I asked last night decx
[08:32:23] <decx> like, when you are on a slide for 2 seconds the slides caption will come in?
[08:32:58] <kingfisher64> i've been asked to put effectively 2 lines of text. one fades in then the other. this is the only job I don't know what I'm doing with. http://fundamentally.worldofdrupal.co.uk/. It's the front slider
[08:33:26] <kingfisher64> so I'll add 2 fields that's fine. I can assign a class for each. fadeintext already exists for one
[08:33:42] <mbrzuzy> kingfisher64, are the captions inside each slide?
[08:33:44] <kingfisher64> i'll do fadeintext2 if that's easiest
[08:33:58] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3Hq7Q/156/
[08:34:02] <decx> i added 2 css rules
[08:34:11] <kingfisher64> yeah, they are in the li.
[08:34:41] <kingfisher64> .views-field-field-caption is a div (can alter it) to which I want to apply the effect
[08:35:53] <mbrzuzy> decx's solution is pretty good
[08:36:16] <jsys> Folks I have two delegated events for a div:     "p"  and "p > .inner"   I don't want the code for "p" to run when people click "p > .inner" but it does. How could I differentiate?
[08:36:32] <mbrzuzy> if you need a second line or caption to fade in after, you can use CSS3 transition delay on it
[08:36:44] <robertmaxrees> jsys run the stopPropagation() method on the event for the p > .inner
[08:36:53] <jsys> robertmaxrees, ah yes!
[08:36:59] <jsys> robertmaxrees, sweet, trying it thanks :D
[08:37:40] <mbrzuzy> give this a glance over too ;) http://css-tricks.com/dangers-stopping-event-propagation/
[08:37:56] <kingfisher64> i see decx. where is the slide (text affect) code? I'd like ideally a fade in after say 5 seconds for example
[08:38:49] <decx> last 2 css rules
[08:38:56] <decx> transition with delay
[08:39:29] <decx> and then the actual caption rule only on .flex-active-slide .flex-caption
[08:39:39] <decx> to activate it when your active slide gets its class
[08:39:41] <jsys> robertmaxrees, works great :D
[08:39:48] <robertmaxrees> jsys cool.
[08:41:02] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[08:41:57] <decx> hey
[08:42:10] <kingfisher64> i see so instead of sliding in from the left a gentle fade from the same place where the caption is how would this be achieved decx? Thank you by the way
[08:42:51] <kingfisher64> would left: just be set to 0?
[08:43:22] <decx> that's just basic css
[08:43:31] <decx> remove left in both instances and just use opacity
[08:46:37] <th3fallen> Hey guys say im doing an each on a set of objects and i have an array of values i want to exclude in the each is that possible?  I know how it do it in php but not jquery?
[08:46:58] <kingfisher64> super, I wondered if the caption was effectively 100% left of it's final transition state then after x amount it slides. in. I suspect that most of .flexslider is already set by the module so would it be best to just start from the line "start: function() {" decx
[08:48:00] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: You can filter the array before hand or just if it as you loop through.
[08:48:58] <th3fallen> BillCriswell how would i go about doing htat?
[08:49:07] <th3fallen> That*
[08:49:22] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: What type of objects are they, first?
[08:49:53] <th3fallen> One sec BillCriswell
[08:51:11] <th3fallen> BillCriswell https://gist.github.com/th3fallen/149d53a49b1e6186f512
[08:51:26] <th3fallen> Trying to filter on the objects id value
[08:52:20] <decx> kingfisher64 left:100% was just a quick way to put it outside its parent container, doesnt really matter
[08:53:03] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: I'd do something like var wanted = list.filter(function(item) { return filters.indexOf(item.id) > -1; });
[08:54:52] <th3fallen> inside the each BillCriswell ?
[08:55:34] <th3fallen> Actually that returns the things i dont want
[08:55:39] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: You wouldn't need the each... but if you're in the each doing other stuff might be easier to do this if (filters.indexOf(item.name) > -1) { /* Do things */ }
[08:56:31] <kingfisher64> thanks decx, jphase, that's working nice on http://fundamentally.worldofdrupal.co.uk
[08:56:33] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: Yeah. The word "filter" is weird. I always assume "filter out what I don't want" instead of "filter down to what I want"
[08:56:55] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: You can change it to === -1
[08:57:08] <kingfisher64> i've not put caption text on all slides yet, hence it not being seen on all, but for those that have text they work
[08:57:39] <EredarLord> Hi guys, is there a way to select a DOM element from a data-attribute after it has been appended to it with jQuery? (example: http://jsfiddle.net/9a8fsjm3/3/ )
[08:57:45] <th3fallen> if (unwantedFilters.indexOf(value.id) === -1) {
[08:57:45] <th3fallen> 				console.log(value.id);
[08:57:45] <th3fallen> 			} worked thanks BillCriswell
[08:57:57] <BillCriswell> th3fallen: Sweet.
[08:58:30] <th3fallen> Thanks for the help
[08:58:36] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:13:48] <EredarLord> Hi guys, is there a way to select a DOM element from a data-attribute after it has been appended to it with jQuery? (example: http://jsfiddle.net/9a8fsjm3/3/ )
[09:14:21] <robertmaxrees> EredarLord .data() doesn't add a data attribute.
[09:14:22] <decx> data() saves the information in _cache
[09:14:23] <BillCriswell> EredarLord: You can use .filter
[09:14:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:14:51] <BillCriswell> $('.item').filter(function () { return $(this).data('id') === 'item0001'; });
[09:16:33] <EredarLord> Thanks guys, trying to see if it will work with .attr instead of .data
[09:16:39] <EredarLord> for a simpler solution
[09:17:01] <EredarLord> works, thanks guys
[09:17:22] <robertmaxrees> EredarLord don't use .attr() for data attributes.
[09:17:25] <robertmaxrees> and don'
[09:17:35] <kingfisher64> that works so well. thank you again decx. That was my only job I didn't know how to do :)
[09:17:37] <robertmaxrees> *don't select on data attributes if you can avoid it.
[09:17:38] <EredarLord> oh :(
[09:17:49] <robertmaxrees> EredarLord that's why we suggest using .filter()
[09:17:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, add a class.
[09:18:03] <EredarLord> I can't because the ID's can contain spaces :(
[09:18:11] <EredarLord> i'll try with filter then
[09:18:15] <EredarLord> thanks!
[09:18:57] <decx> you can also write an expression
[09:22:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Like a jQuery.extend(jQuery.expr[':'], {}); jawn.
[09:22:51] <BillCriswell> decx: question mark
[09:23:20] <decx> expre[':'].data and then a split() marathon
[09:23:38] <decx> i'm not saying it's good ^^
[09:23:48] <BillCriswell> You're recommending it.
[09:23:55] <BillCriswell> to Jon Resig.
[09:24:16] <decx> i'm just saying
[09:24:28] <decx> because ih ad to deal with a ridiculous expression today
[09:39:39] <bbclover> hey guys, can I not do $(window).on('resize', function() { });?
[09:39:51] <bbclover> I'm getting an error... Object doesn't support property
[09:41:23] <robertmaxrees> is jquery loaded?
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> and if so, what version are you using?
[09:42:08] <bbclover> jquery is loaded, how do I check the version loaded?
[09:42:14] <bbclover> I think it's like 2.something
[09:43:06] <bbclover> changed it to $(window).resize(); and it worked
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> you can run jQuery.fn.jquery in the console to get the version.
[09:44:49] <bbclover> 1.3.1
[09:44:53] <bbclover> Is that super mega old
[09:44:53] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[09:44:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:44:59] <robertmaxrees> .on() didn't exist yet.
[09:45:04] <bbclover> hahaha
[09:45:13] <bbclover> Should I be using 1.11?
[09:45:16] <bbclover> or hwat is the greatest
[09:46:08] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/ ;)
[09:46:12] <MikeD_> do you build a model to represent the state of your app (and martial changes to UI back to the model) or just read the DOM when you care to know the state of each control?
[09:46:19] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.1 or 2.1.1, depending on what brows3ers you need to support.
[09:47:11] <bbclover> would there be any issues from ugprading?

[10:14:51] <usrb1n> Hello. I am using a browser extensions that let's you improove a page/tool by adding custom html/javascript/css. I need to use datepicker function from jQuery UI on my project but I am blocked by the fact that the original page is already loading jQueryUI without this widget. If I load it twice it will totally crash. Is there any way to load jQuery UI only with datePicker without having a conflict between the 2 loaded scripts?
[10:20:16] <robertmaxrees> usrb1n i'd suggest finding a standalone calendar widget instead.
[10:21:34] <usrb1n> I see :) I was thinking about that but I wanted to ask if I am missing something and maybe there is some option for this. But thinking better I don't want to replace original's page jQueryUI with mine as that can disable some coded functions (the jqueryUI version is older that the one I have). Thank you robertmaxrees
[10:22:10] <robertmaxrees> usrb1n i'd avoid loading it twice simply for the sake of avoiding the weight/execution.
[10:22:18] <robertmaxrees> especially if all you need is a single widgets.

[10:31:11] <EdwardIII> hey, should $._data( $("#foo")[0], "events" ); show delegate events too?
[10:31:22] <EdwardIII> e.g. $._data( $("#some-parent-element-that-listens-for-clicks-on-a-tbody")[0], "events" );
[10:31:27] <dodo> hi
[10:31:34] <dodo> nice to meet you
[10:31:36] <EdwardIII> trying to debug some stupid backbone issue
[10:35:13] <liav3000> Hey, there. I have some pretty simple javascript inside a `$( document ).ready` call, which does a bit of manipulation to some form elements. It's running twice, which foobars some of the DOM mutation. I'm just curious what could cause that?
[10:35:38] <Duvdevan> liav3000 post your code
[10:35:42] <Duvdevan> jsfiddle or elsewhere
[10:36:26] <dodo> liav3000: or gist
[10:36:49] <liav3000> hey, it's at: https://gist.github.com/liavkoren/9053b059fb8578a58e26
[10:37:11] <robertmaxrees> is your markup valid?
[10:38:15] <liav3000> Almost certainly not, but it's almost certainly not broken in any serious way -- it's generated by a pretty seriously heavy Django site.
[10:38:52] <Oka> Could you make a fiddle with a snippet it generates?
[10:39:12] <dodo> liav3000: I'm reading your code, you means ready function fired twice, right?
[10:40:13] <MikeD_> generated markup that isn't valid ?  ew.
[10:40:24] <supsup> question:   why does clicking the parent cause the children to also turn red?  http://jsfiddle.net/6aohoLbh/1/
[10:40:25] <liav3000> dodo: When I add a breakpoint at the `move_to_top_of_list` function, that breakpoint gets hit twice. Moving 'Canada' to the top off the twice the second time completely removes it from the select widget.
[10:41:06] <dodo> liav3000: ookay
[10:41:24] <robertmaxrees> supsup the cascade.
[10:41:32] <robertmaxrees> supsup the child elements inherit that color.
[10:41:51] <supsup> robertmaxress: how do i stop the cascade?
[10:42:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't.  you apply css to those elements that overrides the cascade.
[10:42:46] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/6aohoLbh/2/  why does this also cascade
[10:42:55] <supsup> i don't understand why $(this) is not just the item i clicked on
[10:43:00] <supsup> instead of it and it's children
[10:43:18] <robertmaxrees> $(this) doesn't cascade.
[10:43:20] <robertmaxrees> the css does.
[10:43:49] <supsup> ah ok
[10:43:53] <robertmaxrees> hence the name.
[10:44:40] <supsup> yah i get it thanks.

[11:05:30] <|RicharD|> hi
[11:06:53] <|RicharD|> why it doesn't delete the html taken from event.target ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/98956a1ff01272973eb3
[11:07:36] <kevin> |RicharD|, mayybe you want event.currentTarget
[11:07:43] <|RicharD|> I copy the event.target in a variable before the ajax call...then if the ajax call is successfully I want that it remove the div(event.target) from html
[11:07:51] <|RicharD|> mmmh now I try
[11:08:37] <|RicharD|> not works :(
[11:09:07] <|RicharD|> btw event.target show the correct div in console
[11:10:05] <pll^> hey guys, im wondering if someone can help me; I have some json data; http://insanepools.com/scoreboard/sb-NHL.json -- I load it into var games via $.getJSON, how would I sort it, say by <gamestate status> for example?  All the examples I can find are pretty simple and don't include an xml like <tag> stuff like this data... any suggestions or can you point me in the right direction?
[11:12:21] <dodo> liav3000: dodo: When I add a breakpoint at the `move_to_top_of_list` function, that breakpoint gets hit twice. Moving 'Canada' to the top off the twice the second time completely removes it from the select widget.
[11:12:32] <dodo> liav3000: i just read your code
[11:12:48] <liav3000> Yup.
[11:12:50] <dodo> where is your break point line number.
[11:13:04] <dodo> you changed option value
[11:13:22] <dodo> than update_state_element
[11:13:28] <dodo> will be fire

[11:19:15] <liav3000> Why is the code running twice?
[11:19:28] <dodo> liav3000: move_to_top_of_list(UNITED_KINGDOM_CODE); this?

[11:26:45] <iheartpandas> I am initializing a jquery ui slider and am getting this error when I click the slider: Cannot read property 'addClass' of undefined, the code for the initialization of the slider is at this gist: https://gist.github.com/amiranda222/bdd85e2f472eedcbc518
[11:37:45] <chuqiao> 'm trying to include a jquery library(handsontable http://handsontable.com/) in django template. I included all the required javascripts, and called the function in the template (http://pastebin.com/pznZePx0). But i'm getting an error saying "undefined is not a function" Can someone help me with that?
[11:38:10] <robertmaxrees> chuqiao which line is giving you that error?
[11:38:57] <chuqiao> robertmaxrees:  "$('#table1').handsontable" this line
[11:39:09] <robertmaxrees> is the plugin included in your <head>?
[11:39:32] <chuqiao> yes I included all the required javascript
[11:40:26] <robertmaxrees> that error means the plugin doesn't exist.
[11:40:41] <robertmaxrees> so make sure the plugin is actually loadin before you try to use it.
[11:41:11] <chuqiao> i checked that, and all the files were successfully loaded.
[11:41:41] <chuqiao> I have a demo that does the exact same thing, except that it's html.
[11:41:41] <robertmaxrees> dunno then without seeing it in action.
[11:41:50] <chuqiao> I'm wondering if it could be a problem with jquery version
[11:42:04] <robertmaxrees> are you loading jquery more than once?
[11:43:02] <chuqiao> I'm developing in a django project and jquery is loaded for each page already. So i didn't include any jquery on that template
[11:43:21] <robertmaxrees> sometimes it can happen on accident through other means - it's worth checking.
[11:46:50] <chuqiao> i just checked. I think it was only loaded once
[11:47:50] <robertmaxrees> open your console and try to do $.fn.handsontable
[11:48:45] <chuqiao> it returned this "http://pastebin.com/3Tj96NLy"
[11:49:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then you have another issue at play.  try using $(window).load() instead of your document ready.
[11:49:16] <robertmaxrees> if that fixes it, your page isn't valid.
[11:49:58] <chuqiao> ok
[11:50:26] <chuqiao> it still returned the same error
[11:50:36] <chuqiao> "undefined is not a function"
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> then the plugin isn't properly loading.
[11:50:49] <robertmaxrees> are there any other errors on the page?
[11:50:58] <robertmaxrees> and what version of jquery are you using?
[11:54:07] <chuqiao> that's the only error. the plugin is using 1.11.1. my page is loading 1.7.2
[11:54:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is using 1.11.1 of jquery?
[11:54:42] <robertmaxrees> but you're also loading 1.7.2?
[11:55:04] <chuqiao> yes. that jquery is included in the django project.
[11:55:14] <chuqiao> should i load another one?
[11:55:16] <robertmaxrees> so you're loading two versions of jquery...
[11:55:58] <chuqiao> i meant that demo is using 1.11.1
[11:56:17] <chuqiao> but i'm only using the one in the django project which is of 1.7.2
[11:56:19] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't outright prevent your plugin from working.
[11:58:11] <robertmaxrees> sounds like there's something else going on.  can you share an example or something?
[11:59:31] <iheartpandas> I am initializing a jquery ui slider and am getting this error when I click the slider: Cannot read property 'addClass' of undefined, the code for the initialization of the slider is at this gist: https://gist.github.com/amiranda222/bdd85e2f472eedcbc518
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> iheartpandas can you setup a fiddle of your problem?
[12:01:27] <chuqiao> i'm not sure what to post. this is really all I have for my django template "http://pastebin.com/90SGCKUF"
[12:01:29] <iheartpandas> not really, the slider renders on a bootstrap modal through backbone, basically I don't see how I can isolate it and simulate everything that is going on in the real world case
[12:01:54] <chuqiao> and the demo that works looks like this "http://pastebin.com/vepw0kfR"
[12:02:01] <robertmaxrees> chuqiao a functioning test case in jsfiddle would be great.
[12:02:16] <robertmaxrees> iheartpandas i'd isolate things out to see if the issue really is with jqui or if it's backbone.
[12:02:22] <iheartpandas> the main issue I am finding is that after I submit the modal and write the data inputted on the form to its model and then rerender the same modal the slider then works
[12:03:02] <iheartpandas> well call render on the view associated with that model that was created and saved
[12:06:56] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:08:09] <dodo> see ya
[12:20:30] <schtinky> question about periodic polling: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/7695936
[12:21:35] <robertmaxrees> I'd swap to using the .then() instead.
[12:23:36] <schtinky> robertmaxrees:  what's the difference?
[12:23:41] <robertmaxrees> simpler.
[12:23:50] <robertmaxrees> .then() does the work of that.
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/r6opg43/ like this.
[12:24:44] <schtinky> I was about to ask you for that :)
[12:25:24] <schtinky> Is there any functional difference? I've never used .then() before and I want to push this to production soon
[12:25:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd also setup a slightly more featureful way to doing it every minute.
[12:25:52] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[12:25:55] <robertmaxrees> it explains what it does.
[12:27:25] <schtinky> robertmaxrees:  ok thanks for your help.
[12:52:46] <Scriptonaut> guys, I have an li, inside is an <a>, containing an <i>. I want to have some text be to the right of it when you hover (and have it animate and expand). How would you guys recommend I lay it out? I want the text to be invisible if no hovering
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> not valid.
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> misread what you put.
[12:54:00] <Scriptonaut> also, how could I have the div containing this li increase to width of thee content?
[12:54:05] <Scriptonaut> I don't want to have to set the width manually
[12:54:16] <robertmaxrees> could you share what you've got?
[12:54:23] <Scriptonaut> sure
[12:54:54] <Scriptonaut> oh, I'll share in a moment, having a rails issue that I gotta resolve first
[12:55:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand your question better.
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> if you have text for each li, just add that markup and animate it in/out or whatever.
[12:55:55] <bbclover> hey guys, I don't understand the success case here: http://jsfiddle.net/clickthelink/Uwcuz/1/ -- how is returnhtml being set?
[12:56:22] <robertmaxrees> success: function(returnhtml){
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> you're naming that argument for the function.
[12:57:30] <bbclover> but then why is it setting the id to returnhtml?
[12:57:42] <robertmaxrees> what ID?
[12:58:04] <bbclover> $("#result").html(returnhtml);
[12:58:13] <bbclover> what is returnhtml?
[12:58:22] <robertmaxrees> the data returned from the server.
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ tells you the three optional arguments available for that callback.
[12:59:40] <bbclover> and why is it whatever we type in the textarea?
[12:59:58] <robertmaxrees> because the server is returning that data for you.
[13:00:41] <bbclover> but where is that handled? is it behind the scenes on the click event?
[13:00:47] <robertmaxrees> where is what handled?
[13:01:20] <bbclover> that the server is returning that data for me
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> on click, you're submitting data to a server, the server then returns something do you and you update a #result container
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> *something to you, rather
[13:01:36] <bbclover> submit event rather
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[13:01:59] <bbclover> yeah, I was just correcting myself haha
[13:02:08] <bbclover> cause I called it a click event
[13:02:13] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[13:02:14] <bbclover> but I guess it's a submit cause .submit
[13:02:17] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[13:02:23] <robertmaxrees> you understand the general idea.
[13:02:43] <spudzee> I have a silly question that I can't ask a #html
[13:03:06] <bbclover> yeah, thanks
[13:03:10] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ spudzee
[13:03:10] <b-ot> spudzee: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:03:14] <bbclover> I'll look over it some more. It's above me right now
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> bbclover it's pretty simple, really.
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:03:29] <bbclover> thanks
[13:03:41] <spudzee> alright
[13:04:10] <spudzee> I have a div that I made a circle by setting border-radius:50%;
[13:04:22] <spudzee> in css
[13:05:03] <spudzee> when I move my div around the page using top and left, it will move it from a side of the circle instead of the center
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ spudzee
[13:05:20] <spudzee> how do I change this?
[13:05:20] <b-ot> spudzee: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:05:26] <spudzee> alright
[13:07:32] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/4c9xs5xg/
[13:07:39] <spudzee> I want the sun to be centered
[13:07:55] <spudzee> no matter what the height and width of the page are
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> what browser support do you need?
[13:09:24] <spudzee> preferably all of the 5 majors
[13:09:36] <Oka> http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/4c9xs5xg/1/ ?
[13:09:38] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - how far back for IE?
[13:09:56] <spudzee> uh
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4c9xs5xg/2/ because you can do this.
[13:10:07] <robertmaxrees> but IE9 and below won't work.
[13:10:19] <dunpeal> in jsTree, there's a configuration like `"icon" : "glyphicon glyphicon-file"`. It's right in the demo: http://www.jstree.com/demo/
[13:10:28] <spudzee> I hate those who use IE anyways
[13:10:35] <dunpeal> However, when I try to use it, no icon appears. What am I doing wrong?
[13:10:38] <Oka> @ spudzee Check mine.
[13:10:46] <fatmandown|> Hey guys, is there a decent guide to using getJSON inside of a for loop?
[13:10:50] <robertmaxrees> spudzee they comprise a fairly large market share and give my company lots of money soooo....
[13:10:57] <spudzee> alright
[13:11:00] <spudzee> whatever
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> also, for future reference, this is more of a #css question, not an HTML question ;)
[13:11:31] <spudzee> just go a head and optimize it for that silly browser
[13:11:33] <Oka> or jQuery, since that's the channel we're in.
[13:11:47] <spudzee> it wouldn't let me post anything on #html
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're not registered.
[13:11:59] <spudzee> I haven't checked to see if there exist a #css
[13:12:09] <spudzee> I might not be
[13:12:13] <spudzee> I really don't know
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> there's a #css
[13:12:23] <robertmaxrees> register your account though.
[13:12:31] <spudzee> I can't figure out how
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering
[13:13:54] <spudzee> okay, back to business. How do I optimize that for IE?
[13:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you should know what versions you need to support, but Oka gave you an example that'd work for old IE.
[13:14:55] <spudzee> one thing though
[13:15:06] <spudzee> about oka's
[13:16:19] <spudzee> it says position is fixed; is that not going to cause problems? I do plan on making this a scroll-able page, and I don't want the sun to always be in the way of everything
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> you're not really defining the problem very well.
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd go ask in #css for more guidance if i were you.
[13:17:17] <spudzee> alright, I'll head over that way
[13:36:11] <spudzee> okay, I actually I have a sort of jquery question this time
[13:36:20] <spudzee> for oka
[13:38:53] <Oka> Oh, hey
[13:38:58] <Oka> Ask  away
[13:39:15] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/4c9xs5xg/4/
[13:39:19] <spudzee> why isn't that working
[13:39:35] <spudzee> I tried removing bottom to make it work, but it didn't and it caused more problems than it solved
[13:39:57] <Oka> Problem with jsfiddle, you need to load the libraries you want to use on the left hand side
[13:39:58] <spudzee> I want the sun to start in the middle and move down using animate
[13:39:58] <Oka> http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/4c9xs5xg/5/
[13:40:05] <Oka> Oh move down?
[13:40:26] <Oka> http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/4c9xs5xg/6/
[13:40:41] <spudzee> okay
[13:40:45] <spudzee> yeah that works
[13:41:00] <spudzee> thanks
[13:41:03] <Oka> Do you plan on doing a lot of animation with jquery?
[13:41:15] <spudzee> actually yes
[13:41:25] <spudzee> I am trying to make a game similar to flappy bird
[13:41:29] <Oka> You should take a look at Velocity.js http://julian.com/research/velocity/
[13:41:46] <fatmandown|> Is there a best practice to looping over getJSON requests
[13:41:58] <Oka> Uses the same syntax as jQuery's animate, just replace .animate() with .velocity()
[13:42:00] <fatmandown|> I can't seem to get it to work, and using closures isn't working either
[13:42:01] <spudzee> just vertical instead of horizontal, and I want it to be planets and stars
[13:42:04] <Oka> It's way more perfomant
[13:44:41] <spudzee> question about velocity
[13:44:49] <spudzee> how do I make it work
[13:44:54] <spudzee> or install it
[13:44:59] <spudzee> or include it
[13:45:25] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone know a good solution for implement collaborative pads in a webapp?
[13:45:26] <Oka> Download the file and include it in your html head, after jquery
[13:45:50] <spudzee> I just use the usaul <script> tag?
[13:46:13] <Oka> Yeah it's just a .js file
[13:53:49] <spudzee> is this not how it's done: $('#sun').click(function() {$(this).velocity({top:'100%'},500); } );
[13:54:09] <spudzee> sorry, jsfiddle didn't have a velocity option that I could find
[13:55:16] <spudzee> something seems to be wrong with that code above
[13:57:26] <Oka> That will work with velocity, but its hard  to load velocity in jsfiddle - no CDN for velocity
[13:57:45] <spudzee> maybe I didn't 'install' it right
[13:57:47] <Oka> You can use jqueries animate for now, that's fine, but in your local project consider using velocity
[13:58:12] <spudzee> yeah, I want to use velocity, it's just difficult to install
[13:58:37] <spudzee> I copied this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianshapiro/velocity/master/velocity.min.js
[13:58:53] <spudzee> to a js file, saved it, then used script tag to connect it
[13:59:09] <spudzee> all it said was 'download'
[13:59:17] <spudzee> pretty vague in my opinion
[13:59:33] <tomasm-> hi, is there a jquery plugin that helps set options in a select (via a function call)? Right now I have to write a few lines to do so. I was just hoping to find a third party helper plugin
[13:59:51] <tomasm-> ie $(select).setoptions({1=>"One",2=>"Two"}})
[14:00:01] <BillCriswell> tomasm-: You could write one pretty easily.
[14:00:34] <tomasm-> yeah I have i guess. just thought something was out there.
[14:01:13] <spudzee> did I install velocity right?
[14:01:33] <spudzee> I feel like I keep giving information and I forget to ask a question
[14:07:11] <Oka> One sec spudzee, I know a cdn for velocity, let me find it
[14:07:47] <Oka> http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/4c9xs5xg/9/
[14:08:22] <Oka> http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/4c9xs5xg/10/ with on click
[14:10:49] <chriskonings> Hi All :)
[14:17:21] <Oka> chrisshattuck: Hello.
[14:18:50] <jakesyl> hey guys, is there anyway to  modify a text input before posting it via php
[14:18:54] <chrisshattuck> Oka: Yo!
[14:31:36] <jakesyl> hey guys, is there anyway to  modify a text input before posting it via php
[14:31:57] <Oka> Grab the input value to a variable, and do whatever you want with it?
[14:52:14] <_DB> how can I hide an input form?
[14:52:18] <_DB> $(#id).hide() didnt work
[14:53:57] <robertmaxrees> "input form"?
[14:54:12] <_DB> yeah like a text input?
[14:54:20] <_DB> for a form?
[14:54:25] <robertmaxrees> .hide() will set display none on it.
[14:54:39] <_DB> $('#scategory').hide();    doesnt seem to work for me
[14:54:46] <robertmaxrees> is the selector right?
[14:54:53] <_DB> yeah its a select box
[14:54:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6nv0axgz/
[14:55:02] <robertmaxrees> because this works.
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($('#scategory').length) - what do you get?
[14:56:10] <_DB> got 1
[14:56:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.  try running your code from the console.  what happens then?
[14:58:22] <_DB> [select#scategory.input-sm.form-control.inline, context: document, selector: "#scategory", jquery: "1.11.1", constructor: function, toArray: function…]
[14:58:28] <_DB> got an array
[14:58:55] <robertmaxrees> when you do $('#scategory').hide() ?
[14:59:22] <_DB> yeah
[14:59:30] <robertmaxrees> but the thing doesn't hide?
[14:59:42] <_DB> nope :/   <select class="input-sm form-control inline" required="required" id="scategory"
[14:59:57] <robertmaxrees> and that's the only thing with that ID on the page?
[15:00:02] <_DB> yeah
[15:00:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:02:05] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/72Lsn63g/
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/72Lsn63g/1/
[15:03:10] <robertmaxrees> this works fine soooo...
[15:07:16] <Tomashe> Hey guys i got some question about jquery mobile. ther eis the mobileinit looks like that doesnt work on desktop.
[15:08:04] <_DB> robertmaxrees why 3 equals?
[15:09:13] <robertmaxrees> _DB type coercion vs non type coercion.
[15:09:21] <robertmaxrees> 5 and "5" aren't the same thing.
[15:09:31] <robertmaxrees> 5 === 5 is true, 5 === "5" is false.
[15:10:14] <_DB> ahh
[15:10:20] <_DB> it still doesnt work for me :[
[15:11:14] <robertmaxrees> it works in the fiddle, sooo...
[15:12:48] <_DB> what did you change to make it work?
[15:12:56] <_DB> just the ===
[15:13:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/72Lsn63g/4/
[15:13:46] <robertmaxrees> even without any code changes it works.
[15:20:16] <mastahyeti> Are there more docs anywhere on how to run the jquery unit tests?
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> mastahyeti https://github.com/jquery/jquery#running-the-unit-tests
[15:22:49] <mastahyeti> "Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the "test" directory."
[15:22:58] <mastahyeti> robertmaxrees: that doesn't really tell me what to do
[15:23:10] <mastahyeti> not sure what run the site means
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a webapp.
[15:23:26] <mastahyeti> so I setup an apache server pointing at the repo?
[15:23:44] <robertmaxrees> with php, yes.
[15:24:19] <mastahyeti> k. thanks
[15:31:06] <csgeek> hi all.  I'm working with datatables plugin and I was wondering if it's possible to use the responsive plugin to load additional data.  (basically I need to link the table row ID with a JSON data call that would popular the data dynamically )
[15:31:10] <csgeek> in theory
[15:34:07] <robertmaxrees> csgeek i'd ask in their forums.
[15:34:30] <csgeek> robertmaxrees: thx
[15:36:52] <Sherafff> hi
[15:37:19] <Sherafff> what would be a selector to get a <select> element only if the option selected is not disabled
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> use a filter.
[15:39:35] <Sherafff> robertmaxrees: $("select option:not([disabled]):parent") return the option element
[15:39:38] <Sherafff> i need the select element
[15:41:04] <Tomashe> i was putting data-role="listview" but its not styling it
[15:43:01] <robertmaxrees> Sherafff there's also .closest()
[15:44:11] <Sherafff> robertmaxrees: i need a selector
[15:44:21] <Sherafff> $("select#search-makes option:selected:not([disabled])").parent() would work, but i can't use any function
[15:44:22] <robertmaxrees> why can't you chain a method?
[15:44:51] <Sherafff> let's say it's part of a generic function, it's not the only selector
[15:44:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:45:05] <robertmaxrees> :parent should be functionally identical.
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> but i'd need to see an examplke.
[15:45:36] <Sherafff> :parent doesn't work
[15:45:51] <Sherafff> $("form").find("input[name], textarea[name], select[name]:not(disabled)")
[15:45:54] <Sherafff> that's my selector
[15:46:04] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle?
[15:46:05] <Sherafff> but i don't want the select element if the option selected is disabled
[15:46:14] <Sherafff> ok
[15:51:38] <Sherafff> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/xapnk6d4/
[15:52:39] <Sherafff> basically, i don't want the select element if the option selected is disabled
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> and why does it need to be in a selector like this?
[15:53:34] <Sherafff> i don't know why, that's how i did though
[15:54:38] <Sherafff> :parent doesn't work ...
[15:54:54] <robertmaxrees> err...
[15:55:00] <robertmaxrees> you want all inputs that aren't disabled.  that's easy.
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> well, easy-ish.
[15:55:32] <Sherafff> yeah, but the select element is not disabled itself, it's just the option element inside the select that is disabled
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to massage your selected elements a bit
[15:56:16] <Sherafff> of course i can put a if somewhere in the $.each
[15:56:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you need to do.
[15:56:30] <Sherafff> like if el.type == option: el = el.parent()
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> check out using .add() and .filter9)
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> *.filter()
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> long, cutesy selectors makes for confusing code.
[16:27:58] <Tomashe> anyone knows why this isnt triggering $("body").on("click","a[href=#services]",function(){
[16:31:01] <Woet> Tomashe: because it needs quotes. href='#services'
[16:31:21] <Woet> Tomashe: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[16:31:45] <Tomashe> i was putting quotes aswel
[16:31:47] <Tomashe> not working
[16:32:06] <Tomashe> on("click","a[href='#services']",function(){
[16:33:00] <Woet> Tomashe: works fine for me, http://jsfiddle.net/mhc0h3p8/
[16:35:09] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:35:41] <Tomashe> i just find my issue i forgot to attache the js sorry for bother mate
[16:35:43] <Tomashe> and thats a lot!

[16:42:37] <tomasm-> hi, I've read in the docs for data() that html5 data-* attributes will automatically be parsed as JSON if possible.... however, I'm having trouble with that, ie:
[16:42:47] <tomasm-> var div = $("<div data-units=\"{'one':'One','two':'Two'}\"></div>"); console.log(div.data('units'));
[16:42:54] <tomasm-> returns a string instead of object.
[16:46:13] <shoky> tomasm-: that's not valid JSON. use double quotes instead of single quotes in the json
[16:46:52] <tomasm-> ok i see
[16:47:27] <tomasm-> thanks
[16:47:31] <shoky> though if you're creating the element in js, you can just use .data() directly
[16:48:08] <Jattenalle> shoky, that single/double quote thing is so obnoxious... also who designed a "human readable format" that by spec does not allow whitespace!
[16:48:10] <shoky> e.g.  var div = $("<div>").data('units', {'one':'One','two':'Two'});
[16:48:11] * Jattenalle shakes head
[16:48:11] <tomasm-> no, that was just a sample to test out the html
[16:48:24] <robertmaxrees> not really gonna change what i said, but ok.
[16:48:29] <robertmaxrees> woops was scrolled up.
[16:48:37] <Jattenalle> robbyoconnor, welcome to the future!
[16:48:41] <Jattenalle> wait, what?
[16:48:45] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, *
[16:50:15] <shoky> Jattenalle: what do you mean by not allowing whitespace?
[16:50:52] <Jattenalle> {"one":1, [newline here, maybe a tab] "two":2 }
[16:51:11] <Jattenalle> is not valid json if you follow the specs to the letter
[16:51:16] <Jattenalle> they explicitly disallow whitespace
[16:51:43] <shoky> i don't think so
[16:52:10] <shoky> js> print('test')
[16:52:12] <b-ot> shoky: test
[16:52:30] <shoky> js> print( JSON.parse('{"one":1, \n\t "two":2 }') )
[16:52:34] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[16:52:40] <shoky> well, that works, anyways
[16:52:50] <Robdgreat> js> alert('hi!')
[16:52:53] <b-ot> Robdgreat: No output.
[16:53:01] <Robdgreat> >.>
[16:53:05] <shoky> js> print( JSON.parse('{"one":1, \n\t "two":2 }').two )
[16:53:09] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[16:53:12] <shoky> ;S
[16:53:25] <Jattenalle> \n\t isnt parsed inside '
[16:53:38] <shoky> what?
[16:53:52] <Jattenalle> js> print( JSON.parse("{\"one\":1, \n\t \"two\":2 }").two );
[16:53:56] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[16:53:58] <Jattenalle> D:
[16:54:15] <Jattenalle> js> print( JSON.parse("{\"one\":1, \"two\":2 }").two );
[16:54:19] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[16:54:23] <shoky> Jattenalle: that works fine too
[16:54:32] <Jattenalle> bot just hates json
[16:54:36] <shoky> there's no difference in js between ' and "
[16:54:42] <shoky> you're thinking of some other language
[16:54:59] <Jattenalle> perhaps, possibly
[16:55:21] <shoky> anyway the spec explicitly _allows_ whitespace
[16:55:29] <Jattenalle> i should've been clearer
[16:55:40] <Jattenalle> it does not allow whitespace inside an array or object definition
[16:55:48] <Jattenalle> you can have it before or after, but not in it itself
[16:55:48] <shoky> that's not any clearer
[16:56:22] <shoky> doesn't matter before/after/object/array
[16:56:32] <Jattenalle> did for me
[16:56:52] <Jattenalle> with newlines and tabs both FF, Chrome, would throw a fit
[16:57:02] <Jattenalle> if i stripped newlines and tabs, it'd process just fine
[16:57:14] <Jattenalle> jquery's json parser handled it fine in both cases
[16:57:36] <Jattenalle> so i looked it up and the specs do not allow whitespace inside the strcutures
[16:57:41] <shoky> they do :\
[16:57:44] <Jattenalle> only leading/trailing
[16:58:20] <Jattenalle> shoky, this is an example of the json i use http://gaicdn.com/icons/buildings.data
[16:58:41] <tomasm-> Jattenalle, ok what about strings that have whitespace?
[16:58:47] <Jattenalle> shoky, that will not be parsed by FF or Chrome.. but if you strip the newlines/tabs from the "409":{ } parts it works fine
[16:58:59] <shoky> it'll be parsed fine
[16:59:00] <Jattenalle> tomasm-, a string is a string, doesnt matter what's in there
[16:59:02] <shoky> and it's valid json
[16:59:05] <Jattenalle> shoky, i'm telling you it wasnt
[16:59:08] <shoky> you had something else going on, then
[16:59:17] <Jattenalle> no difference, you can even test it yourself
[16:59:35] * Jattenalle i say realizing i havent tested it in the latest version of FF or Chrome
[16:59:46] <shoky> maybe you had a syntax error in your _JS_ code
[16:59:59] <Jattenalle> and the specs do say you cant have whitespace inside a struct
[17:00:03] <shoky> by having a newline inside a jsonj string
[17:00:06] <shoky> which is invalid _JS_
[17:00:16] <Jattenalle> ?
[17:00:20] <shoky> (i mean an actual newline, not a \n)
[17:00:27] <shoky> like..  var string="wow
[17:00:30] <shoky>  wow";
[17:00:38] <Jattenalle> oh, no it was loaded from a file
[17:00:52] <shoky> let's see..
[17:00:53] <Jattenalle> literally that file
[17:01:46] <Jattenalle> jquery will load it fine though, so that's what i ended up using in the end
[17:02:31] <shoky> jquery doesn't have a json parser
[17:02:42] <shoky> it uses the browser's
[17:02:57] <Jattenalle> i just realized i'm remembering all wrong
[17:02:59] <Jattenalle> my bad
[17:03:20] <Jattenalle> and now im unsure what the issue was
[17:03:32] <Jattenalle> err, what caused the issue, code-wise
[17:04:52] <Jattenalle> i swear it was something with newline, ajax/json
[17:04:54] <Jattenalle> oh well
[17:05:09] <Jattenalle> i'm probably wrong, and it was something else in the code that didnt like the newlines
[17:05:11] * Jattenalle shrugs
[17:06:36] <shoky> probably. cause it works fine: http://jsbin.com/qopimuyuhi/1/edit?js,output
[17:20:06] <acidjazz> does jquery $.get or $.json have something where i can say for every single time i use it, send ajax=1 as a parameter?
[17:20:50] <systemfault> Why would jQuery have that stupid "feature?!?"?
[17:21:01] <systemfault> Just send that variable yourself.
[17:21:37] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz you can use $.ajaxSetup() and define default values.
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> but that won't append/prepend automatically for you.
[17:22:14] <acidjazz> so there no option on here?
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> are you looking to include other parameters?
[17:22:50] <systemfault> acidjazz: x and y problem, why do you need to do that?
[17:23:24] <robertmaxrees> probably trying to differentiate between ajax and non ajax requests without setting headers or something.
[17:23:32] <systemfault> is you need to know if an ajax transaction has been made on the backend... IIRC, jquery sends a X-REQUESTED-WITH header
[17:23:40] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: exactly
[17:23:47] <acidjazz> systemfault: what rob said
[17:24:18] <tomasm-> how do I make a copy of a data structure returned by data() so any modifications dont affect the underlying structure (or future calls to data() )?
[17:24:44] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz that's a really bad solution to that problem imo.
[17:24:51] <systemfault> tomasm- You can do deep copies using  $.extend
[17:25:02] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: well a header would be more ideal but i couldnt find any
[17:25:14] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz you can set application/json for the request type.
[17:25:33] <systemfault> tomasm-: You need to pass "true"(without quotes) as the first parameter
[17:25:41] <tomasm-> ok thanks
[17:26:09] <acidjazz> x-requested-with XMLHttpRequest
[17:27:46] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz http://stackoverflow.com/a/14655768/923919
[17:29:07] <systemfault> X-REQUESTED-WITH is "pretty much standard", all XHR libs send it (jQuery included)
[17:29:25] <systemfault> So you don't need to do anything on the client side.
[17:29:53] <acidjazz> yea well..
[17:30:09] <acidjazz> i was also kind of thinking at an API level to be able to specify output
[17:30:17] <acidjazz> so i might still go down this route..
[17:30:25] <acidjazz> but thank you robertmaxrees this def works
[17:34:54] <acidjazz> only thing is this header solution is not easy to debug
[17:35:16] <acidjazz> so theres no solution to adding a parameter tahts passed every time for any $.get or $.post ?
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> again.
[17:35:35] <robertmaxrees> you can set a default param, but it won't append or prepend.
[17:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ie if you set any on a given request, it'll override the default.
[17:35:50] <robertmaxrees> but that's a really bad way to do it imo.
[17:52:11] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: i think thats a great way
[17:52:18] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: where are these default params?
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> i sent you the documentation on ajaxSetup already
[17:52:38] <acidjazz> found it thanks
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd really caution against it, but whatever floats your boat.
[17:54:18] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: i can set default ajax potions but not a default get/post parameter..
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:54:49] <acidjazz> oh i guess i can.. i guess data: gets merged
[17:55:06] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:55:48] <acidjazz> are you like. .looking to the right
[17:55:52] <acidjazz> are you rolling your eyes at me
[17:56:08] <acidjazz> is that an eyeroll emoticon
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> just confused.
[17:56:53] <acidjazz> $.ajaxSetup data: format: 'json'
[17:57:21] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[18:03:50] <kuil09> hi
[18:30:38] <seanz> Greetings all.
[18:30:46] <seanz> I'm having a heck of a time setting the background-image property on an element.
[18:31:09] <seanz> I've tried $('#element').css('background-image', 'url(http://my.absolute.url/);');
[18:31:21] <seanz> Also $('#element').css('backgroundImage', 'url(http://my.absolute.url/);');
[18:31:30] <seanz> Also $('#element').css({'backgroundImage': 'url(http://my.absolute.url/);'});
[18:31:36] <seanz> Also $('#element').css({'background-image': 'url(http://my.absolute.url/);'});
[18:31:40] <seanz> Nothing seems to work.
[18:32:39] <seanz> I'm making this change within some jasmine tests, so it's happening pretty quickly.
[18:32:51] <seanz> I'm wondering if there are some browser limitations kicking in that I don't know about.
[18:33:23] <Woet> seanz: http://jsfiddle.net/w0hr7h3h/
[18:33:34] <Woet> no ; behind the url.
[18:34:02] <seanz> Could this be the magic I have searched for....
[18:34:03] <seanz> Trying.
[18:36:03] <seanz> Woet: Ah, you win!
[18:36:14] <seanz> That was exactly the problem. Oh man. I lost a couple hours on that one.
[18:36:15] <seanz> Thanks!
[18:36:35] <Woet> no worries
[18:39:43] <seanz> Woet: It's nice to see all those passing specs. :)
[18:48:34] <rgriggs> Is anyone active on jquery-dev?
[18:54:40] <BillCriswell> rgriggs: I dunno.
[18:55:34] <rgriggs> Hi Bill, I've found a problem with the way jQuery handles addClass/removeClass for SVG elements.  Wanted to chat with the devs regarding a way to fix.
[18:56:01] <rgriggs> Would I be better off using the forum?
[18:57:04] <systemfault> It would be a bug if jQuery was supposed to support SVG, no?
[18:58:34] <rgriggs> I'm not sure if jQuery is supposed to support SVG or not... but there appears to be a simple fix which would easily support SVG elements.
[18:58:48] <rgriggs> just wanted to run it by the devs to see what their reasoning for *not* implementing it.
[18:58:57] <rgriggs> and/or possibly implement myself.
[19:04:43] <BillCriswell> rgriggs: It's a known issue / won't fix.
[19:05:37] <BillCriswell> rgriggs: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10329
[19:07:30] <rgriggs> Thanks Bill, I'm chatting with dev Dave Methvin about this issue also.
[19:07:57] <BillCriswell> rgriggs: Sweeet
[19:09:17] <BillCriswell> Wow, classList isn't supported in IE9. That's annoying.
[19:10:13] <BillCriswell> and IE11 doesn't get it right.

[19:42:15] <nikhildaga> Hey.. I am using nested dropdowns in bootstrap3. The problem is when I click on the nested dropdown, its parent also closes. How to prevent it?
[19:42:35] <nikhildaga> Check http://jsbin.com/vexowiwule/1/  . When clicked on modulo 2, the dropdown closes
[20:17:50] <spudzee> why does this not give me a number in string format: toString(Math.floor((Math.random() * $(window).width()) + 1)).concat('px');
[20:17:58] <spudzee> with px at the end
[20:19:06] <uskerine> hi
[20:19:23] <uskerine> how can you make the cursor become a hourglass and then go back to the default pointer?
[20:19:37] <spudzee> you could use .css
[20:19:38] <acidjazz> what do you get spudzee
[20:19:49] <acidjazz> uskerine: css cursor
[20:20:20] <acidjazz> spudzee: why not just  + 'px'
[20:20:34] <spudzee> [object window]px
[20:20:40] <spudzee> that's what it shows
[20:21:13] <acidjazz> is .width() returning a number value
[20:21:48] <spudzee> let me check
[20:21:51] <spudzee> it might not be
[20:21:53] <acidjazz> it is for me
[20:22:17] <uskerine> I have tried this without success: $('#buttonArchive').click(function() {
[20:22:17] <uskerine>    $(this).css('cursor', 'progress');
[20:22:17] <uskerine>  ....
[20:22:25] <acidjazz> its your toString
[20:22:33] <spudzee> is it?
[20:22:38] <acidjazz> its xxx.toString()
[20:22:40] <acidjazz> other way around
[20:22:42] <spudzee> oh
[20:22:45] <spudzee> okay
[20:22:51] <spudzee> that actually makes sense
[20:22:57] <acidjazz> >> 31337.toString()
[20:23:02] <acidjazz> oh no js bot in here
[20:26:10] <uskerine> what selector should be used to ensure that the pointer is an hourglass no matter where in the web page is positioned?
[20:28:47] <bigwax> cursor: progress or wait   maybe?
[20:28:52] <bigwax> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_cursor
[20:29:00] <bigwax> hover over the text values on the right
[20:29:45] <bigwax> you can hijack the cursor so that it uses an image or gif but i'd avoid that
[20:30:04] <bigwax> is that what you are asking uskerine?
[20:30:14] <uskerine> I am getting a weird behaviour
[20:30:25] <uskerine> .css('cursor', 'progress');
[20:30:37] <uskerine> it works,  but I am not sure if I am using the right selector
[20:31:15] <uskerine> once a button in a bootstrap modal is clicked I would like to set up the hourglass and remove another modal is shown (when the savingprocess ends)
[20:32:31] <bigwax> you are using ajax yes?
[20:33:13] <uskerine> right
[20:34:17] <bigwax> i've done something similar with a loading gif (although not using the cursor)
[20:34:28] <bigwax> see if this is what you are interested in http://stackoverflow.com/a/10801889/1822096
[20:34:33] <uskerine> I'll check
[20:38:05] <acidjazz> bigwax: an image/gif cursor? how?
[20:38:38] <acidjazz> uskerine: i would just 100% css taht.. have the cursor property in css bound to the element you want it to change for if you can
[20:38:58] <uskerine> uhm I am reading and it seems a  big mess
[20:39:07] <uskerine> is it easy to do this? : http://ajaxload.info/
[20:39:08] <acidjazz> wow cursor: url()
[20:39:10] <uskerine> it would work too
[20:39:25] <acidjazz> yes uskerine http://jsfiddle.net/q94EV/
[20:39:26] <uskerine> -i mean it would inform the user too-
[20:40:28] <uskerine> acidjazz I think that the problem is more because when you have a real application there is a set of layers and items, and they interact between them, so body and html might not be enough
[20:40:47] <acidjazz> yea you could bind it to classes
[20:40:51] <acidjazz> in css
[20:41:20] <uskerine> I'll try the gif anywa
[20:41:22] <uskerine> y
[20:44:28] <reyley> this isn't really a jquery question but i am using jquery to POST a message. Anyway I'm using a mvc framework so I was wondering where would the smart url to POST the message to would be so it can be handled. So say the jquery script is located at url: domain.com/user/test My three options are I could post to that url, post to another url like domain.com/postmessage/message or post to an api
[20:44:28] <reyley> like api.domain.com/?method=postmessage.
[20:44:38] <reyley> or should i ask somewhere else?
[20:46:37] <jsys> reyley, I find it hard to understand your question
[20:47:43] <jsys> reyley, for APIs, my advice is have domain.com/api/  and the rest as POST fields inside. A standard field for the method/action/API name inside the POST field set is "action"
[20:48:29] <jsys> reyley, so this means $.post('//domain.com/api/', {action: "getTop10News", filter: { category: "celebrities"}}, handler);
[20:51:28] <reyley> jsys: so you're supporting the POST to an API option rather than post to the same page option?
[20:51:38] <reyley> sorry if my question is unclear
[20:51:42] <reyley> ill try to fix it
[20:52:42] <jsys> reyley, I don't support either, I've done both, but usually your API has a common response type and boilerplate code: like route to method, then return the answer as JSON.
[20:52:52] <jsys> reyley, so you can repeat that in every page, or not.
[20:53:06] <jsys> reyley, here's the optimal approach: think in terms of "apps"
[20:53:11] <jsys> reyley, not pages, or domains.
[20:53:19] <jsys> reyley, maybe your domain hosts several sub-apps.
[20:53:20] <uskerine> acidjazz, how would you return cursor back to normal with the cursor: url method?
[20:53:29] <jsys> reyley, then you can have one API page for each such app.
[20:53:49] <jsys> reyley, or maybe several pages comprise one app, then have one API page
[20:54:26] <jsys> uskerine, you can set it to "auto"
[20:54:36] <reyley> jsys: what you are saying was one pro i thought of for posting to a specified action page like $.post("/postmessage")
[20:54:52] <jsys> reyley, it's pointless to have one URL per message
[20:55:06] <jsys> reyley, I see no benefit to it, just more complicated routing
[20:55:12] <reyley> you mean one url per action?
[20:55:15] <jsys> Yes
[20:55:24] <reyley> oh yes that is also a con
[20:55:30] <reyley> more routes need to be specified
[20:55:32] <jsys> Well it's a con without pro :P
[20:55:38] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/q94EV/119/http://jsfiddle.net/q94EV/119/
[20:55:52] <jsys> reyley, stick to post fields :P skip the fads.
[20:56:07] <uskerine> it does not bring the cursor back to "default"
[20:56:38] <jsys> uskerine, it should, hmm. Well you can explicitly set it to "default", but then it won't, say, show text cursor over text, while "auto" does pick the best cursor
[20:57:19] <jsys> uskerine, the issue you have may be unrelated to setting that CSS property (bad selector etc)
[20:57:50] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/q94EV/119/
[20:58:13] <jsys> uskerine, that's not how css() works
[20:58:27] <uskerine> uhm
[20:58:28] <jsys> uskerine  css('cursor', 'auto') or css({cursor: 'auto'})
[20:58:55] <uskerine> oops
[20:58:55] <uskerine> sorry
[20:59:53] <jsys> uskerine, also the fiddle didn't have jQuery loaded
[21:00:24] <jsys> uskerine, http://jsfiddle.net/q94EV/122/
[21:00:26] <uskerine> thanks
[21:00:38] <acidjazz> uskerine: theres a default cursor
[21:00:45] <uskerine> sometimes  I amaze myself on how many mistakes can be included in a single line of code
[21:00:46] <acidjazz> uskerine: or just remove the .css or dont assign anything
[21:01:13] <jsys> uskerine, yeah, amazing right :D I mean just think of the thousands and thousands of lines of code we write that work somehow.
[21:01:30] <jsys> It's almost magic, I think sometimes
[21:05:41] <uskerine> one thing I noticed is that the GIF animation is not shown, right?
[21:16:36] * CssN00b good afternoon y'all
[21:31:35] <uskerine> this is much complex than it appears, I am trying to use animated icon through this, but it does not work: https://blog.oio.de/2010/11/08/how-to-create-a-loading-animation-spinner-using-jquery/
[22:04:13] <xhd> hey guys i am on my way to learning bootsrap is it  best to understand jQuery before I learn bootstrap? sorry for asking here but it doesnt seem like there is a bootstrap channel
[22:06:03] <ussher_> ##bootstrap xhd  whichever first is fine i reckon
[22:07:35] <norc> Hi. I have a set of CSS classes (redBox, greenBox, yellowBox) that I use to indicate the status of various things. Is there some jquery accessory  function that allows me do something like: " $(this).removeClass("redBox").removeClass("yellowBox").addClass("redBox")
[22:07:56] <norc> Because that really doesnt look nice.
[22:13:48] <xhd> thank you very much ussher_
[22:17:47] <uskerine> finally I followed this but without the AJAX binding, I .show and .hide at the right locations: https://blog.oio.de/2010/11/08/how-to-create-a-loading-animation-spinner-using-jquery/
[22:56:17] <root3d> can i change html href , currently i do $(".linkclass").attr("href", htmlembed_link) ? but how would i change html attr of href ?
[22:59:30] <Oka> What?
[23:11:23] <Cork> root3d: that question is quite hard to understand, but if you mean if you can modify the html instead of the parsed dom
[23:11:33] <Cork> the no you would have to use regexp for that
[23:11:43] <Cork> or parse to dom > modify > serialize back to html
[23:12:56] <root3d> Cork, problem solved https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/fc6de481bba05b4cf11c
[23:14:13] <Cork> root3d: uh, that isn't even what you asked...
[23:14:50] <root3d> Cork, more precisely : $(".googleplus a").html(data.company_details.googleplus_link.justlinkify());
[23:15:06] <Cork> ya i get that from the code
[23:15:18] <Cork> but you did't ask a question even remotely related to what the snippet does
[23:16:24] <root3d> Cork, my mistake, i just wanted to append <a> tag but i figured a hacky way..
[23:16:50] <Cork> root3d: no you wanted to linkify urls in a text
[23:16:53] <root3d> Cork, sometimes i mess up in explanation, i must be more verbose.
[23:16:56] <Cork> it isn't even html
[23:17:13] <root3d> Cork, that snippet returns html
[23:17:22] <Cork> ...
[23:19:09] <root3d> Cork, i will better explain next time, don't worry
[23:31:24] <root3d> Cork, so i am stuck how to use $(this) in jquery , i have lot of div with same class , how can i differentiate which div is clicked and call onclick slidedown for its text . for example: https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/7a203f4417c8217143b8
[23:31:41] <root3d> did i explained it better this time ?
[23:32:43] <Cork> root3d: $(this).nextAll('.service-content').show()
[23:32:53] <Cork> root3d: as .service-content is a sibling to -heading
[23:35:30] <root3d> Cork, that would slidedown all other div's also ! right ? i want that service-heading's content to slidedown
[23:35:59] <Cork> root3d: no it wouldn't as the other aren't siblings
[23:39:38] <root3d> Cork, doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/qgvz6ex5/1/
[23:40:02] <Cork> uh
[23:40:18] <Cork> what ever you're trying to do here won't work $(this).attr(".service-content").is( ":hidden" )
[23:40:25] <Cork> or here $(this).attr(".service-content").slideUp()
[23:41:15] <Cork> to be honest i don't even understand what you're trying to do
[23:43:13] <Cork> root3d: also you should start using the browsers web console
[23:43:19] <Cork> so you see when code crashes
[23:43:55] <root3d> got it working, using browser's console. chrome rocks : http://jsfiddle.net/qgvz6ex5/4/
[23:44:14] <Cork> ...
[23:44:32] <Cork> root3d: i think you need to start with learn.jquery.com
[23:45:00] <root3d> Cork, yeah. advice taken.
[23:45:27] <Cork> root3d: cause the code you just gave checks all elements
[23:45:31] <Cork> not only the one you care about
[23:45:43] <root3d> Cork, i happen to be polyglot programmer, will learn it seriously.
[23:46:54] <root3d> is there a alternative , all divs have same class , so it has to check all the elements
[23:49:25] <Cork> root3d: i gave you the answer
[23:49:39] <Cork> it is the same as the last time i answered it :)
[23:50:13] <kuil09> hi
[23:50:29] <root3d> Cork, ok
[23:50:33] <root3d> kuil09, hey
