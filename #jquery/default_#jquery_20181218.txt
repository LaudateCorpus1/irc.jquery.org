[07:39:17] <bigpresh> Just a sanity check: if I add a class to an element via addClass(), then I should expect that item to be then returned by a selector looking for that class, shouldn't I?
[07:39:58] <bigpresh> i.e. if I have a div with class foo, and I say $('.foo').addClass('bar'), now $('.foo') and $('.bar') should both find that div?
[07:49:58] <Cork> bigpresh: yes, as long as you run the selector ($()) again
[07:50:02] <Cork> or .find()
[07:50:15] <Cork> var z = $(); z won't have changed after it
[07:51:23] <bigpresh> Aye, cheers.  In the usual rubberduckery, I realised afterwards that the problem was me being a muppet and putting a space between the two classes I was searching for :)
[07:51:37] <bigpresh> (i.e. $('.foo .bar') rather than $('.foo.bar') )
[07:51:42] <bigpresh> But thanks!
[07:51:49] <Cork> heh classic
[09:33:02] <c_dull> hello all
[09:33:33] <c_bluntish> :)
[09:53:31] <c_bluntish> is anyone about
[10:13:13] <undefined_bob> c_bluntish: just ask :) if someone read your questions (and know an answer), you will get an answer
[10:48:40] <c_bluntish> is there any way to see what has changed in ff or chrome after js or jq function / code has been called?
[10:48:52] <c_bluntish> what has changed to dom object that is
[10:51:05] <c_bluntish> on running a function, my js now does not work for the entire page
[11:18:09] <c_bluntish> is anyone about?
[12:20:58] <jak2000> hi all
[12:21:01] <jak2000> undefined_bob thanks
[12:53:52] <c_bluntish> is it possible to make debugger step over jquery calls?
[12:56:32] * c_bluntish seems to be the only one in here today
[13:00:00] <robertmaxrees> c_bluntish sure - black box the source.
[13:00:27] <robertmaxrees> search google for how to do that in your dev tools.
[13:01:13] <c_bluntish> awsome :)
[13:01:17] <c_bluntish> thanks again robertmaxrees
[13:01:20] <c_bluntish> :)
[13:05:23] <c_bluntish> how was your weekend rob?
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> *robert ;)
[13:05:31] <robertmaxrees> and meh.
[13:05:33] <robertmaxrees> yours?
[13:05:46] <c_bluntish> pretty meh tbh
[13:05:57] <c_bluntish> horrible weather here in the uk over the weekend
[13:06:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> i know all about that these days.
[13:06:13] <c_bluntish> hehe
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> we had flooding nearby recently.
[13:06:31] <c_bluntish> it pouring down now, I just stood outside for a smoke, and I am drenched
[13:06:40] <c_bluntish> really? not so bad I hope
[13:06:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah - did you hear about the camp fire?
[13:06:58] <c_bluntish> uk is pretty used to flooding, so we have contingies about it...
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> the big one in norther california?
[13:07:02] <c_bluntish> no what camp file?
[13:07:12] <c_bluntish> oh another forrest lost?
[13:07:16] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> worse.
[13:08:33] <c_bluntish> damn....
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> that came within about 10 miles of me./
[13:09:59] <c_bluntish> eek!
[13:10:47] <c_bluntish> thank oden it missed you!
[13:12:03] <c_bluntish> robertmaxrees, can I ask your advice about general front end dev?
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[13:13:30] <c_bluntish> I am writing some simple jquery, js etc, and when it does not work, I find it very difficult to see what is going on with the js, often if its a syntax error then np, but it its something more, I struggle to debug it, console helps, and I just learned I can step through js files using debugger
[13:13:45] <robertmaxrees> *js - jquery isn't a language fwiw :)
[13:13:49] <c_bluntish> but this seems a bit naff, I am used to visual studio which has extensive options for debugging
[13:13:52] <c_bluntish> I know, sorry
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> what kinds of errors are you running into?
[13:14:15] <c_bluntish> is there a proper way or better way to test and debug js?
[13:14:31] <c_bluntish> well when I make a mistake, and something dosent work
[13:14:35] <c_bluntish> and console says nothing
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> there are unit testing frameworks.
[13:15:04] <c_bluntish> yeah ... I wondering if there was a way people developed that I was missing
[13:15:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're talking about just the normal dev cycle.
[13:15:12] <c_bluntish> yeah
[13:15:22] <c_bluntish> It feels like I am going about things the wrong way
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> then it sounds like youi just need ot get used to JS.  are you running into any particular issues repeatedly?
[13:15:40] <c_bluntish> not really
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> you're asking a very nebulous question - hard to offer advice.
[13:15:50] <c_bluntish> sorry
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[13:17:33] <c_bluntish> its the sort of thing thats hard to explain via text on irc, its the sort of thing I would sit with someone and go through
[13:17:45] <c_bluntish> sorry for my cloudy explanation of the situation
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:17:47] <c_bluntish> :)
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd see if you can
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> *can't find patterns.
[13:18:13] <robertmaxrees> like maybe you're mixing up types, or struggling with async code.
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:20:19] <c_bluntish> sorry .... I keep on typing something out and then deleting it all, its so hard to explain what I mean on irc, just disregards hehe thats the easiest way to deal with this situation hehe
[13:20:28] <robertmaxrees> oooookay
[13:29:59] <c_bluntish> everyone has went home for christmas or something
[13:30:06] <c_bluntish> just us 2 left :)
[13:31:10] <robertmaxrees> nah
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> room's slowly been growing the last few days, evem.
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> *even
[13:51:20] <z1haze> hey, could someone give me a hand with troubleshooting what is breaking in a jquery plugin after i upgrade to 3.3.1? I'm not sure how to debug exactly where the issue lies.. I just know now a specific plugin is undefined after we upgraded jquery
[13:51:30] <z1haze> however, the version on npm is the latest and is the same we currently use
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze what's the issue?
[13:56:20] <z1haze> we had to upgrade jquery from 2.2.4 to 3.3.1 because i guess it failed the pci check, or whatever -- i dunno the details im just doing what im told .. anyway now i have an undefined issue on one of our plugins, ddslick
[13:57:21] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:57:32] <robertmaxrees> can oyu provide more details?
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> is it https://github.com/jsmodules/ddslick/issues/14 ?
[13:58:11] <z1haze> sorry man -- i guess im just asking what is the typical process to find out why a plugin doesn't work after upgrading jquery -- or if my symptons of the plugin being undefined now is actually usually the issue, or one of those this points to that type of problem
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you updated the plugin.
[13:58:42] <z1haze> yea it isnt that, i already looked at the github, and the latest version of the plugin is using jquery ^3.x
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> so you'd want to make sure the author didn't change anything for the initialization.
[13:58:56] <z1haze> i updated jquery, i may have got ahead of myself on the ddslick version. i am testing something now
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> what's the specific error yu're getting?
[13:59:33] <z1haze> Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: $(...).ddslick is not a function
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:46] <z1haze> its just failing to attach itself to thge jquery object i guess
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab.,
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> make sure the file for ddslick is actually loading.
[14:00:15] <z1haze> its in a webpack bundle
[14:00:27] <robertmaxrees> then your webpack bundle needs to be updated.
[14:00:44] <z1haze> yeah like i said i spoke too soon on udating the plugin
[14:00:47] <robertmaxrees> review your webpack config.
[14:00:52] <z1haze> i was told they updated the plugin, but they only updated jquery
[14:01:03] <z1haze> updated the plugin and its good.
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:01:31] <z1haze> but their semantic versioning doesnt really follow the right process for breaking changes
[14:01:38] <z1haze> it went from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty common.
[14:01:47] <z1haze> ythat shouldnt techinically be breaking would it?
[14:01:50] <z1haze> if they followed it correctly
[14:01:52] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> what did they update?>
[14:02:14] <z1haze> jquery dependency lol
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:02:21] <z1haze> from 2.2.4 to 3.
[14:02:29] <z1haze> oh well, all is good now
[14:02:30] <z1haze> thanks
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> it depends on who you ask.  dependency updates make semantic versioning lolsy.
[14:02:58] <z1haze> a 'patch' shouldnt have breaking changes
[14:03:15] <robertmaxrees> and they didn't make any breaking changes to their code.
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> they can't necessarily account for all scenarios.
[14:03:32] <z1haze> oh im sure theres more, i just saw the package.json change
[14:04:02] <robertmaxrees> either way, not everybody follows semantic versioning anwyay.
[23:08:21] <Rockwood> any active?
[23:13:26] <jjrabbit> good evening
[23:13:48] <Rockwood> jjrabbit, good morning
[23:14:07] <jjrabbit> apparently we are in different time zones lol
[23:14:15] <Rockwood> yes
[23:14:47] <jjrabbit> a lot more people here during the day NA time
[23:15:04] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/tagf1bwk/ error i am facing here --> Uncaught TypeError: value.department_name.text is not a function
[23:15:17] <Rockwood> jjrabbit, yes i can understand it
[23:15:51] <Rockwood> jjrabbit, what is your time zone area?
[23:18:43] <jjrabbit> Rockwood: remove the parenthesis
[23:19:31] <jjrabbit> or is that an actual jquery method
[23:24:26] <Rockwood> i mixed it with plain JS
[23:25:30] <jjrabbit> welp there you go
