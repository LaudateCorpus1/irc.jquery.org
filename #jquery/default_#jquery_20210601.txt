[18:48:36] <robertparkerx> fiddle will work

[18:50:31] <robertmaxrees> got a lot of JS errors on there...
[18:51:33] <robertmaxrees> also not sure how to get to that second step of checkout...

[18:52:54] <robertmaxrees> what file is that code in??
[18:53:28] <robertparkerx> inline
[18:53:39] <robertmaxrees> start by fixing all those js errors.
[18:54:06] <robertmaxrees> jquery is bombing out, which is likely causing the rest of the page to fail.  bet if you do $('#customer_details button.next') in the console you'll get an error.
