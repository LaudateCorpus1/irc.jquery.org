[07:54:18] <dopie> exit
[13:09:05] <Sal> is there a way to replace characters while typing?
[13:09:37] <Sal> i'm listening to keydown event and trying to replace the typed COMMA with the char POINT
[13:09:43] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[13:09:50] <Sal> is there a wa y to do it?
[13:10:46] <Sal> robertmaxrees, because now, using the html <input type="number", it doesn't accept commas
[13:11:10] <Sal> so when users try pressing the comma key, they wont get the decimal separator
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> you want localization in that case.
[13:11:29] <Sal> thats why I was thinking on converting , to .
[13:12:07] <Sal> robertmaxrees, that will make thing harder, because i would have to check users localizations before
[13:12:19] <robertmaxrees> also: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32972402/923919
[13:13:28] <Sal> I'm already using the third pattern that accepts both, but still when i press comma, nothing is shown inside the input
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:14:21] <robertmaxrees> ProTipâ„¢: making me play guessing games about your code is a great way to lose my interest.  Make a fiddle with what you've got.
[13:15:17] <Sal> I was just wondering if there was a way to change typed characters before the get to the input
[13:15:43] <robertmaxrees> and i'm saying you don't want to do that :) trying to give you an approach better suited to your use case.
[13:17:15] <Sal> I'm already using the pattern from that sample
[13:17:25] <Sal> and it only accepts points and not commas
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your code it's really hard to help :)
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[13:17:41] <Sal> its only an input
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> then a fiddle should be pretty easy to put together.
[13:18:39] <Sal> <input type="number" step="0.001" pattern="[0-9]+([\.|,][0-9]+)?" onKeyPress="if(this.value.length==7) return false;">
[13:18:45] <Sal> thats it
[13:18:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mq49vbsu/
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like you want ##javascript anyway.
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> not using any jquery in there.
[13:19:45] <Sal> yes, but like i said, its not accepting the comma
[13:19:53] <Sal> as you can see in the fiddle you created
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, head on over to ##javascript for more.
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> since you're not using jquery.
[13:20:10] <Sal> I am
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> rad.  good luck then! :)
[13:21:01] <Sal> ok, thanks
[13:22:53] <Sal> i was trying something like this https://is.gd/mO0xmc
[13:23:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:37] <Sal> i came asking here because i have jquery events
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:23:58] <Sal> ok, i'll add it to the fiddle
[13:24:00] <Sal> 2 secs
[13:28:40] <Sal> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mq49vbsu/
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> gotta save it
[13:28:55] <Sal> this is another way that i was trying
[13:29:06] <robertmaxrees> hit the save button and share out the new url.
[13:29:10] <Sal> https://jsfiddle.net/rxk324bz/
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to mix inline handlers and jquery-bound handlers.
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> also: don't try to "trigger" a keypress.
[13:30:25] <Sal> its a keydown
[13:30:31] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[13:30:37] <Sal> oh
[13:30:42] <Sal> so it can't be done
[13:30:53] <robertmaxrees> did i say that?
[13:31:21] <Sal> unless i add a '.' to the .val()
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:32:05] <Sal> $('#inp').val($('#inp').val() + '.');
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> what happens when someone pastes a number in?
[13:32:51] <Sal> didn't think about that
[13:32:58] <Sal> anyway, its not accepting the commad
[13:33:11] <Sal> so i think something strage would happen
[13:33:17] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:33:23] <Sal> let me try
[13:33:49] <Sal> yes, its not accepting the comma
[13:33:55] <Sal> the main problema is that
[13:34:01] <robertmaxrees> so back WAAAAAAY up.
[13:34:10] <robertmaxrees> what use case are you actually trying to solve for here?
[13:34:13] <Sal> even if i included the comma in the pattern, it doesn't accept it
[13:34:37] <Sal> think its en
[13:34:44] <Sal> i haven't set any
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> like, whya re you so concerned with commas?
[13:35:35] <Sal> because i could have users that type commas trying to get the decimal separator
[13:35:47] <robertmaxrees> really?
[13:35:57] <robertmaxrees> why would a use expect one character while typing another?
[13:35:59] <robertmaxrees> *user
[13:36:32] <Sal> it was just a "help"
[13:36:37] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:36:41] <Sal> so they can see that the field needs a point
[13:37:00] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're trying to solve a problem you don't really have.
[13:37:15] <Sal> I know, but i also know my users
[13:37:16] <Sal> :)
[13:37:28] <robertmaxrees> why would a user type a comma and expect a period?
[13:37:32] <Sal> for me its ok like it is
[13:37:45] <robertmaxrees> have you actually recieved complaints?
[13:37:51] <Sal> ok, I'll tell you what will happen
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked.
[13:37:59] <Sal> the user types 12,23
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> have you actually gotten complains?
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> *complaints
[13:38:07] <Sal> the field accepts 1223
[13:38:13] <Sal> and then the user will call me
[13:38:15] <Sal> :)
[13:38:53] <Sal> I got complains for even less
[13:39:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:39:23] <Sal> anyway, as i can see, its blocked by html itself base on location
[13:39:28] <Sal> so it can't be done
[13:39:31] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> it can be.
[13:39:41] <Sal> unless i read users location
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to rely on browser localization here.
[13:39:54] <Sal> and that complicates morte
[13:39:58] <Sal> more
[13:40:19] <Sal> thats why i was trying to find a simple workaround
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> you don't want the "simple workaround" because it's not a good solution to the problem.
[13:40:57] <Sal> yes, it works
[13:41:23] <Sal> its the solution we alreay use in C# and the users go fine with it
[13:41:38] <Sal> because they don't need to bother what they need to type and they go faster
[13:41:55] <robertmaxrees> C# isn't the web.
[13:42:21] <Sal> Its always a UI input and a dummy behind a keyboard
[13:42:33] <robertmaxrees> and again, C# isn't the web.
[13:42:43] <robertmaxrees> figure out how to get your internationalization to work properly.
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of ham-fisting a solution.
[13:42:58] <Sal> no way
[13:43:03] <Sal> I'll keep the dot
[13:43:06] <Sal> thanks anyway
[13:43:36] <Sal> I prefer them calling than me losing another hour
[13:43:42] <Sal> thanks, bye
[14:42:06] <mandude> Hello
[14:42:44] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[14:42:55] <mandude> How do you do?
[14:43:01] <mandude> I've a slight issue with jquery statement
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> doing alright.
[14:43:07] <robertmaxrees> go on.
[14:44:03] <mandude> http://dpaste.com/2KHXXHA
[14:44:21] <mandude> The condition evaluates to true, alret box shows as the 2nd statement being fired, good.
[14:44:31] <mandude> first stament that sets readonly, does not work here in this code bit.
[14:44:43] <mandude> However, if I try that on browser console, that works to set the inputs to readonly
[14:44:47] <robertmaxrees> clarify "does not work"?
[14:44:49] <mandude> I am wondering what I'm missing/donig wrong
[14:44:59] <mandude> It does not make them readonly
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle with some example html?
[14:45:19] <mandude> Let me try
[14:46:26] <damarusama> if I want to target the first a in a li.phoneCall
[14:46:41] <damarusama> can I $(".phoneCall>a").click
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> damarusama use .first() instead.
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> > a will select all anchors that are direct children of .phoneCAll
[14:47:57] <damarusama> so $(".phoneCall").first().click()
[14:48:22] <robertmaxrees> $('.phoneCall a').first().click()
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask - why call .click()?
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> why not instead call the function you want directly?
[14:48:50] <mandude> https://jsfiddle.net/35kmphcb/
[14:49:42] <damarusama> well I want to trigger a click(function() { tell google }
[14:49:59] <robertmaxrees> just do the tell google part ;)
[14:51:08] <damarusama> so $(".phoneCall").first().function(){ tell Google;}
[14:51:17] <robertmaxrees> lool
[14:51:18] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:51:21] <damarusama> hehehe
[14:51:24] <damarusama> (super noob here)
[14:51:25] <robertmaxrees> update the "tell google" function.
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> mandude erm.
[14:52:02] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#readonly
[14:52:18] <robertmaxrees> mandude readonly doesn't do anything for checkboxes.
[14:52:27] <robertmaxrees> mandude you want disabled.
[14:52:31] <mandude> ah
[14:52:35] <mandude> always confuse the two
[14:52:37] <mandude> dang
[14:53:12] <mandude> However, how come it sets them to readonly when I do this in console?
[14:53:29] <robertmaxrees> are you using any CSS frameworks or anything like that?
[14:53:37] <mandude> .prop("readonly", true); in console, sets them to readonly.
[14:53:45] <mandude> In script file, it does not.
[14:53:53] <robertmaxrees> erm - how are you confirming that it's setting readonly?
[14:53:54] <mandude> Which is what is confusing me. I am not.
[14:54:01] <mandude> By trying to click it
[14:54:06] <mandude> can't check/uncheck any more.
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> also, in your console try $.fn.jquery
[14:54:10] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:54:26] <mandude> "1.10.2"
[14:54:30] <damarusama> allright thanks ;)
[14:54:36] <mandude> They will not upgrade to 3.x
[14:54:45] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:54:51] <mandude> I do not know
[14:55:03] <robertmaxrees> push them to.
[14:55:26] <robertmaxrees> and i'd have to see what you're describing, becuase i can'
[14:55:30] <robertmaxrees> *can't replicate that at all.
[14:55:37] <mandude> :(
[14:55:48] <robertmaxrees> could be a plugin or something somebody wrote.
[14:55:55] <mandude> nope.
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:56:13] <robertmaxrees> if you don't know why, you don't get to reject suggestions ;)
[14:56:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't have your code in front of me so i cannot validate for you.
[14:56:31] <mandude> *nod*
[14:57:04] <mandude> I'm just trying to determine how come the statement does what it is supposed to in browser console, but not in the actual script file that is loaded when the page loads
[14:57:28] <mandude> And it doesn't even really depend on page load, as it's data from an ajax callback
[14:57:36] <robertmaxrees> you've got it backwards.
[14:57:45] <robertmaxrees> and wait
[14:57:49] <robertmaxrees> show more code then.
[14:57:50] <mandude> and in data, that variable is set to 1, and when 1, make the dang checkboxes disabled
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> because it may be a race condition.
[14:58:21] <mandude> Hmm.
[14:58:34] <mandude> Let me just ask the lead dev, he' smuch more familiar with the codebase
[14:58:36] <mandude> I'm the new guy
[14:58:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> or you could just share the code in context.
[15:00:28] <robertmaxrees> is your code in the .then() of the ajax call mandude
[15:02:46] <mandude> hm. let me see. brb
[15:05:05] <mandude> something is hijacking the checkbox click event
[15:05:14] <mandude> some of the custom ui wrapper crappers
[15:05:24] <mandude> Perhaps.
[15:05:30] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[15:05:31] <mandude> Could be anything. Who knows these myseteries of life.
[15:05:39] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:05:41] <mandude> I hadn't gotten around to answering your question
[15:05:46] <mandude> Patience, young grasshoppa
[15:05:52] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[15:05:52] <mandude> It is not in .then I think.
[15:05:53] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[15:06:13] <mandude> I don't think promises are used, or any .then or anything
[15:06:32] <robertmaxrees> are you using any callbacks?
[15:06:36] <mandude> yes
[15:06:41] <robertmaxrees> for the ajax?
[15:06:44] <mandude> that's where the data is coming from, yhes
[15:06:45] <robertmaxrees> can you just share the code?
[15:06:49] <mandude> NDA
[15:06:50] <mandude> :(
[15:06:51] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> you can abstract it out.
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[15:07:06] <mandude> I can try but it would be tim consuming
[15:07:15] <Es0teric> anybody here use select2?
[15:07:18] <robertmaxrees> i would make sure anything that relies on the return of the ajax call is in a callback or .then() for said ajax call.
[15:07:19] <mandude> The code base is just a clusterfsck
[15:07:25] <mandude> I'
[15:07:26] <mandude> I'
[15:07:28] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric just ask your question - if somebody can help, they will.
[15:07:33] <mandude> fsck. I'll try to keep that in mind
[15:07:48] <Es0teric> i just want to know how to select a select2 option from a dropdown
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean set its value?
[15:08:12] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.org/programmatic-control/add-select-clear-items#selecting-options
[15:08:27] <Es0teric> see i have this              $('#activity-length').select2('val', $('#activity-length option:first').val());
[15:08:48] <Es0teric> but its blank on the actual dropdown box
[15:08:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at what i just linked.
[15:09:50] <Es0teric> nah that doesnt work
[15:10:04] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[15:10:27] <Es0teric> i cant make a fiddle
[15:10:31] <Es0teric> jsfiddle is blocked here
[15:10:43] <robertmaxrees> or a bpaste or a jsbin or any other pasting service
[15:10:52] <robertmaxrees> show us code
[15:10:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:12:51] <mandude> howstoned.ru pastebin no ads
[15:12:55] <mandude> simple easy peasy
[15:12:59] <robertmaxrees> or bpaste
[15:13:00] <mandude> https://howstoned.ru
[15:21:40] <robertmaxrees> wait
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric
[15:22:07] <Es0teric> the problem i am having is that the dropdown selects it but the main issue is that there is no actual text
[15:22:07] <robertmaxrees> you know there's a #select2, right?
[15:22:07] <Es0teric> it selects the first option
[15:22:10] <Es0teric> wait what?
[15:22:18] <robertmaxrees> there's a channel for select2 support
[15:22:32] <Es0teric> yeah im on it now
[15:22:49] <robertmaxrees> heh alright.
[15:23:00] <Es0teric> only because you said there is
[15:23:03] <Es0teric> hopefully someone responds
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> also: https://i.imgur.com/W2O5awl.png
[15:25:08] <robertmaxrees> it works fine here.
[15:25:17] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not really sure what your issue is.
[15:28:47] <mandude> robertmaxrees: ping
[15:29:05] <mandude> As it turns out, my co worker reported that my bit of logic/code worked fine on his end.
[15:29:16] <mandude> So I updated my browser and restarted and now it works.
[15:29:23] <mandude> *smh*
[15:29:48] <robertmaxrees> okie
[15:34:00] <Es0teric> damn i just want to change the option text
[15:34:03] <Es0teric> and the value
[15:34:08] <Es0teric> this thing is such a pain in select2
[15:34:12] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[15:34:18] <robertmaxrees> "change the option text and the value"?
[15:35:16] <Es0teric> select fields have option and option has value
[15:35:20] <Es0teric> it also has text
[15:35:28] <Es0teric> inside of <option></option>
[15:35:34] <robertmaxrees> i am well aware of what value and text are.
[15:35:50] <robertmaxrees> your problem statement is confusing.  try rephrasing what you're trying to do.
[15:36:32] <Es0teric> simple
[15:36:48] <Es0teric> i want <option>All Activity</option> to display on the select2 field
[15:36:56] <Es0teric> because right now it has a value but the display text is blank
[15:37:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual HTML you're working with?
[15:37:42] <robertmaxrees> share that in a bpaste or something.
[15:49:22] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://bpaste.net/show/nQWV
[15:49:51] <robertmaxrees> and the JS?
[15:52:43] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to "reset" the select2 to the first option Es0teric?
[15:53:39] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> $('#activity-length').val('all').change();
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[15:54:42] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/CKrj
[15:57:03] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees sec
[15:57:23] <Es0teric> wow
[15:57:25] <Es0teric> that was too simple
[15:57:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:57:36] <Es0teric> =_=
[15:57:42] <Es0teric> i cant believe i couldnt get that but thatnks
[15:57:44] <Es0teric> *thanjks
[15:57:46] <Es0teric> *thanks
[15:57:48] <robertmaxrees> that's what i told you to do earlier and yous aid it "didn't work"
[15:57:56] <robertmaxrees> what were you doing before that was different?
[15:58:11] <Es0teric> i was using the select2 method
[15:58:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees $('#activity-length').select2('val', $('#activity-length option:eq(0)').val());
[15:58:30] <Es0teric> thats what i was doing
[15:58:33] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you use .val() like I and the docs both said to do?
[15:58:55] <Es0teric> i was using .val()
[15:59:03] <robertmaxrees> how?
[15:59:08] <Es0teric> did you not see
[15:59:10] <robertmaxrees> you just said you weren't using .val()
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> to set the value.
[15:59:28] <Es0teric> [03:08:33]  <Es0teric>	see i have this              $('#activity-length').select2('val', $('#activity-length option:first').val());
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> so then you didn't look at the docs when I linked them :)
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> or use the example i gave earlier.
[16:00:21] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.org/programmatic-control/add-select-clear-items#selecting-options
[16:02:33] <robertmaxrees> just trying to understand what was so confusing about both the docs and what i was saying :)
[20:03:29] <Jasein> can someone explain if this is a jquery issue or a css issue or just my plain ignorance issue (betting on the last). the left measurement is off by 8px using getBoundingClientRect() https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/JjPGBMN?editors=1111
[20:06:23] <robertmaxrees> ie why is it 208 when left is 200?
[20:07:15] <robertmaxrees> Jasein ^
[20:09:42] <robertmaxrees> welp
[20:11:07] <Jasein> sorry, I was fixing the pen to make more sense.
[20:11:22] <Jasein> yes. it is 8px off and I am not sure why. Thanks for your help.
[20:11:26] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[20:12:00] <Jasein> i figured as much...but I still don't know why.
[20:12:02] <robertmaxrees> read the docs for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect - then think about the different things that can cause an element (or a parent HINT HINT) to shift where's located.
[20:12:10] <robertmaxrees> *where it's
[20:12:30] <robertmaxrees> there's one property you're not resetting in your CSS :)
[20:14:08] <Jasein> duh. That was stupid. Thanks a lot for your help.
[20:14:17] <robertmaxrees> not stupid, just had to poke a bit :)
[20:14:31] <Jasein> I know better than to not use a css-reset.
[20:14:41] <robertmaxrees> or don't use a css reset at all :)
[20:14:59] <Jasein> ^ quick way for me to go insane.
[20:15:12] <robertmaxrees> also: this was a standard JS issue, not a jquery issue.
[20:32:39] <Jasein> Actually I see what you are saying. I was writing an extension to jquery allowing me to get the dimensions of any element using $.fn.dims. I just hadn't gotten that far. Sorry
[20:41:28] <robertmaxrees> wait
[20:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to get element dimensions?
[20:42:03] <robertmaxrees> why not use the built-in methods?  or just the native JS meethods?
