[07:06:42] <nytek> In JavaScript with HTML/CSS, I'm reverse engineering a calculator. That said, I'm trying to make any number button pressed appear in the calculator screen by tying all of them to a single function.                                                    I have gotten other things working (on/ac, ce, off buttons), but these number buttons will not appear on the screen unless the value has been manually
[07:06:43] <nytek> set which is a problem. I want the function to work like, "this.text()" for each buttons' value appears on the screen. Again, nothing appears right now.
[07:06:46] <nytek> Will anyone please help?
[07:06:57] <nytek> If so, here is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/nytek/Lcy2tyjj/
[07:12:30] <wa5ted> nytek: ummmm your click events look....interesting and redundant
[07:12:59] <nytek> Okay, I am new to this. Any advice is very appreciated, please.
[07:13:11] <wa5ted> basically you are creating a click event
[07:13:15] <wa5ted> running a function
[07:13:19] <wa5ted> and then running a function inside that
[07:13:37] <wa5ted> nytek: https://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/vxcjyL0w/#&togetherjs=prlmquOTa4
[07:13:42] <wa5ted> join me ill show you
[07:13:52] <nytek> Thank you kindly. :)
[07:13:56] <nytek> Just a moment
[07:33:22] <wa5ted> nytek: learn to debug and use the dev tools to your advantage, chances are half the time you will answer your own question
[07:46:48] <mightyboosh> can anyone work out why the 2nd list item can't be clicked to goto google? https://jsfiddle.net/k4kafa9m/
[07:51:12] <murk> mightyboosh: check the quotes
[07:54:55] <mightyboosh> murk: my poor eyes cant find the mistake. is there a way to manage quotes within quotes to make it easier to spot mistakes?
[07:56:11] <murk> mightyboosh: your working-link has single-quotes inside double-quotes which is good, your non-working link has double-quotes within double-quotes which is bad
[07:59:18] <mightyboosh> murk: thanks. ive updated but still not working? https://jsfiddle.net/pntt/k4kafa9m/1/
[08:03:31] <murk> mightyboosh: simply use the html code from working-link in the listItem var and escape the double-quotes of onclick
[08:11:03] <mightyboosh> murk: got it to work. thanks heaps
[08:11:22] <murk> np!
[08:21:32] <matt______> hey
[08:22:09] <matt______> can someone tell me what i++ the i means and can be used for?
[08:22:21] <matt______> I know the ++ is increment
[08:23:48] <shoky> matt______:  i is what you're incrementing.  a variable.  e.g.:    var i = 5;  i++;
[08:24:22] <matt______> ah okay shoky
[09:29:58] <basiclaser> does this look like it would fadeOut text and fade back in with different text? $(".js-input-field label").text("A").delay(1000).fadeOut(“fast").text(“b").FadeIn(“fast")
[11:48:50] <thales_sa> Pessoal, estou tentado usar o chart.js (http://www.chartjs.org/). Coloquei um botão que ao ser pressionado ele faz um gráfico com algumas opções pré selecionadas. mas toda vez que eu aperto o botão o gráfico desce. Alguém sabe como resolver isso ?

[16:57:12] <deadevilboy> hi guys
[16:57:33] <deadevilboy> is it possible to add a value on a hidden input?
[16:57:43] <CorySimmons> whoa nevermind i'm retarded
[16:57:43] <deadevilboy> using the class name only
[16:58:10] <deadevilboy> I tried prop and val but nothing happens
[17:03:31] <deadevilboy> it looks like that hidden inputs don't have class attr
[17:03:36] <deadevilboy> :(
[17:31:51] <hubjon11> Can someone help me with implementing fastclick.js in wordpress. i foound a site that uses a modified jquery version of it and uses it to attach to elements, but i dont know how to do that and i really need this to work

[19:32:00] <ngl> Can anybody tell me how to do this? I made a Spades game, and it works great except the case where a player is allowed to throw off the activeSuit even when they are holding a card of that suit. I found that my problem is in trying to compare:
[19:32:17] <ngl> &spades; ♣ Checking these are equal
[19:33:19] <ngl> How would I take either one... oh, better example for my question:
[19:33:39] <ngl> This should be equal: &clubs; ♣
[19:34:24] <ngl> I can work around it, but is there a way to either tell the entity to render on the left there, or for the right to un-render?

[23:00:38] <claytonzaugg> What's the syntax you use to add an attribute ONTO a tag? For example, let's say I wanted to add attribute foo and the value for foo would be bar.
[23:00:58] <claytonzaugg> .attr() only adjusts the attributes existing correct?
[23:02:12] <claytonzaugg> I guess the better question would be, how do you add an attribute to a tag after document ready?
[23:03:04] <claytonzaugg> Found my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3866063/how-to-add-an-html-attribute-with-jquery
