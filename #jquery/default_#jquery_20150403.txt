[01:55:56] <nuge> wondering if anyone can shed some light on a problem I have - i'm trying to load the contents of a url into a div on a button click.  the contents loaded are dynamically generated based on paramaters in the querystring
[01:56:16] <nuge> is it even posible in js?
[01:56:26] <sacho_> see $.load
[01:58:30] <nuge> sacho - can I tie that to a button event?
[02:01:10] <sacho_> sure, why not
[02:02:13] <nuge> just wondering what the syntax is - onClick='$(#container).load(url);'  ?
[02:02:31] <nuge> (i'm still quite new to jquery)
[02:02:40] <sacho_> learn.jquery.com is a good tutorial
[02:03:24] <nuge> ah - great!  Much appreciated!

[02:25:58] <marcusdei2> Hi guys, is this a help forum for jquery ?
[02:27:46] <cyberbrai> yes
[02:32:15] <marcusdei2> ok maybe you guys can help me
[02:32:37] <marcusdei2> It's about a hidden sidebar on this site: http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[02:32:43] <marcusdei2> it's hidden on the right
[02:32:58] <marcusdei2> here is the html i appended with jQuery
[02:33:18] <marcusdei2> <div class="sb-button"><a href="#"><p>Squids</p></a></div>
[02:33:24] <marcusdei2> <div class="sb-button"><a href="#"><p>Squids</p></a></div>
[02:33:41] <marcusdei2> here is the jQuery I am using
[02:33:49] <marcusdei2> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2> <script type="text/javascript">
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2> $(document).ready(function() {
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2>     $('.sb-button p').click(function() {
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2>         $('#sidebar-2').css('right', '0px !important');
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2>     });
[02:33:50] <marcusdei2> });
[02:33:51] <marcusdei2> </script>
[02:34:19] <marcusdei2> but this snippet is not changing the right position to 0px
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2> <script type="text/javascript">
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2> $(document).ready(function() {
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2>     $('.sb-button').click(function() {
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2>         $('#sidebar-2').css('right', '0px !important');
[02:35:15] <marcusdei2>     });
[02:35:16] <marcusdei2> });
[02:35:16] <marcusdei2> </script>
[02:35:26] <marcusdei2> this version is without the 'p'
[02:36:20] <d3m0n> careful marcusdei2: you can get kicked for spamming code like that
[02:36:23] <d3m0n> Use a pastebin
[02:37:27] <marcusdei2> what's a pastebin ?
[02:38:16] <d3m0n> Also i dont see any sb-button in the html code
[02:40:15] <Uhkis> ?fiddle @ marcusdei2
[02:40:18] <marcusdei2> the sb-button was added with jQuery
[02:40:29] <marcusdei2> @Uhkis ok got it
[02:40:32] <Uhkis> ?demo @ marcusdei2
[02:40:32] <b-ot> marcusdei2: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:40:36] <Uhkis> there
[02:40:40] <marcusdei2> ok
[02:40:42] <marcusdei2> thanks
[02:40:47] <d3m0n> marcusdei2: Then you need to use the "on" click if its added dynamically
[02:40:55] <d3m0n> Attach it to a parent
[02:41:17] <d3m0n> $(parent).on('click', '.sb-button', function(){}
[03:11:29] <d3m0n> I am going crazy here guys
[03:15:01] <Uhkis> d3m0n: why is that
[03:15:48] <d3m0n> Uhkis: I am trying to do a multiple selector and hide whatever is visble and show a specific element.
[03:16:15] <d3m0n> If I set up my code so I individually select the elements and hide them it works but when I try to combine them it messes up.
[03:16:32] <d3m0n> Heres individual: http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/QwPYLd here's combined: http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/yyrGEg
[03:24:37] <d3m0n> :(
[03:28:14] <nuge> when writing a function in your script tag, does it always have be enclosed in a a $(document).ready(function(){ block?
[03:33:13] <d3m0n> nuge: function, no
[03:33:33] <d3m0n> Doc ready is when you want something to run when the docs ready :P
[03:35:42] <nuge> ok - then if I include this - <script>$('#btn').click(function() { console.log("test!"); });</script>
[03:35:43] <nuge>  - shouldn't that work when I hit my button with an id/name of 'btn'?
[03:45:54] <Uhkis> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/h40cLncb/ this is really close :D
[03:47:21] <d3m0n> Kind of, the problem is I won't know which step is showing
[03:47:35] <d3m0n> It could be any 1-4, I just set step1 as default for the example
[03:47:44] <d3m0n> http://jsfiddle.net/h40cLncb/1/
[03:48:11] <d3m0n> And I am only needing to show .step2
[03:48:18] <d3m0n> Not a slider type deal
[04:37:44] <marcusdei2> hi guys, what is an <i class> ??
[04:39:20] <marcusdei2> for font-awesome ?
[04:40:00] <arthurvr> marcusdei2: link? I guess it’s just an <i> element with a class huh
[04:54:41] <marcusdei2> hi guys
[04:54:47] <marcusdei2> the rigth sidebar on this site
[04:55:09] <marcusdei2> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[04:55:24] <marcusdei2> I have hidden the sidebar using relative position
[04:55:48] <marcusdei2> and have used the following jquery codes to append a button to the left side of the sidebar
[04:55:54] <marcusdei2> http://jsfiddle.net/mdeasywebsite/azfouuw3/1/
[04:56:39] <marcusdei2> as you can see, the second jquery code is not working
[04:56:48] <marcusdei2> even though the second jQuery code looks correct
[04:56:55] <marcusdei2> any idea why?
[04:57:12] <marcusdei2> Hope you experienced guys can help! :)
[05:10:43] <CluelessDevelope> Guys I have a question. Right now I'm using window.location.hash to retrieve variable content on a page. But I'm wondering if it's possible to do such things without having the hash in my url
[05:10:55] <CluelessDevelope> I mean the actually hash symbol
[05:11:34] <wheeei> Hi Im trying to implement bootstrap on a site that already runs jquery 1.9.0 and jquery-ui-1.10.2. Is there I way I can do that without loading in jquery 1.11.2 as well? Dont really wanna load in an extra 90kb js file...
[05:12:16] <CluelessDevelope> I'd do it the other way around. Load 1.11.2 since bootstrap depends on it
[05:14:31] <wheeei> CluelessDevelope so there isnt a way I could ruin something on the site buy switching from 1.9.0 to 1.11.2 ?
[05:15:12] <wheeei> I just realized maybe I should just use the jquery UI lol... gah
[05:15:30] <CluelessDevelope> Not really jQuery has some backwards compability. If you wish to be sure just check the change notes
[05:16:36] <arthurvr> wheeei: There are some ways stuff could break, you should just try it out lol
[05:16:49] <arthurvr> wheeei: Or use jquery-migrate
[05:17:04] <arthurvr> wheeei: changelogs can be found on blog.jquery.com
[05:17:27] <CluelessDevelope> Yeah I def suggest using jquery-migrate if you are worried
[05:28:01] <hollusion> .find('tr td:last') seems to return only one object, how can i match every last td in all trs?
[05:30:17] <arthurvr> hollusion: you mean like this?
[05:30:18] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/raporivuwe/1/
[05:31:03] <hollusion> yes, that mans i have to plit the find up in 2 find()
[05:31:22] <hollusion> *means
[05:31:25] <hollusion> *split
[05:31:27] <hollusion> sorry :)
[05:31:57] <hollusion> arthurvr: yes that works, thank you
[05:32:30] <arthurvr> hollusion: I did that for performance. :last is a jQuery only pseudo.
[05:32:49] <CluelessDevelope> last-child
[05:32:53] <arthurvr> hollusion: check the note on http://api.jquery.com/last-selector/
[05:32:56] <CluelessDevelope> Would have worked as well
[05:33:01] <arthurvr> yup.
[05:33:17] <arthurvr> Just did it like this because you mentioned last yourself, last-child would work.
[05:36:55] <seb__> Hello ! I`m using jquery multiple select from this site: http://wenzhixin.net.cn/p/multiple-select/docs/
[05:37:22] <CluelessDevelope> Good for you seb__
[05:37:31] <CluelessDevelope> ;-)
[05:37:45] <arthurvr> seb__: Did you have any questions?
[05:37:48] <seb__> yea ;)
[05:37:52] <seb__> Typing now ^^
[05:38:13] <seb__> Yeah thanks. but the thing is that when I click outside my select, i doesn`t dissappear
[05:38:35] <seb__> It only dissapears when I clink in range of my form, lets say an input field or smth
[05:38:52] <gsoc-interest> Is arthurvr around?
[05:39:07] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: not sure
[05:39:12] <CluelessDevelope> Have you figured out what event fires when you click outside of it in the form aka what triggers the closing?
[05:39:51] <gsoc-interest> arthurvr:you was the team member I talking to correct? Need some more help
[05:40:11] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: about google summer of code you mean? Let’s move to #jquery-dev again.
[05:40:27] <gsoc-interest> fair enough
[05:40:35] <gsoc-interest> see you there?
[05:40:47] <seb__> hmm the only thing i figgured out is that the div changes from <div class="open"> to <div class>
[05:42:18] <seb__> so it look like its only working in the area of its form
[05:43:19] <CluelessDevelope> Well I would suggest bind a click event to the window that triggers when the target is not that form element it removes the open class
[05:44:29] <CluelessDevelope> It seems your plugin has an option called keepOpen
[05:44:39] <CluelessDevelope> Try giving the false value for that attribute
[05:45:23] <MikeD_> You have a lot of advice CluelessDevelope :)
[05:46:13] <MikeD_> no disrespect, but that's an ironic nick if you're going to dispense information
[05:46:21] <CluelessDevelope> Eh tbh I just learned a lot over the past year going from uni to an actual job and during uni I came here all the time
[05:46:38] <CluelessDevelope> I used to be Clueless ;)
[05:46:44] <seb__> Yes I saw that keepOpen: true but in my application its set to false.
[05:47:03] <CluelessDevelope> Hmm well in that case I'll refer to solution 1
[05:47:14] <CluelessDevelope> It's kinda dirty
[05:47:37] <CluelessDevelope> But dirty works ya know
[05:50:38] <seb__> I didnt quite understand how would your solution works
[05:50:44] <seb__> could u describe it more precisely ?
[05:51:04] <CluelessDevelope> Sure thing. Gimme a sec I'll mock up a fiddle real quick
[05:51:45] <seb__> Thanks !
[05:52:28] <CluelessDevelope> We usually ask people to submit their own fiddles with the problem. But what I'll post won't have the actual plugin just some code ;D
[05:54:17] <seb__> I was wondering is there a function similar to "onClick" or "mouseOver" which is called onOutsideClick ?
[05:54:33] <seb__> which checks if the click was outside of the boundaries of our element
[05:55:21] <CluelessDevelope> Well you could just save the last element you clicked in a variable and compare :)
[05:56:31] <seb__> hmm wouldnt I have to have a action triggered to every div or element ?
[05:56:46] <MikeD_> seb__: document
[05:56:54] <CluelessDevelope> or window
[05:57:20] <CluelessDevelope> $(document).on('click',function(){...});
[05:57:21] <CluelessDevelope> exmp
[05:57:32] <MikeD_> hmm... is one of those better or worse?
[05:57:45] <Uhkis> i prefer body
[05:58:14] <CluelessDevelope> It's just the level of the scope that you select.
[05:58:17] <CluelessDevelope> Window is errthing
[05:58:27] <CluelessDevelope> document is the entire document and everything in it
[05:58:35] <CluelessDevelope> and body is an element in the dom
[05:59:27] <seb__> I could show you that website if you want
[05:59:42] <seb__> And you could check how does it work, its already in production
[06:00:03] <CluelessDevelope> Oh well sure just pm or post
[06:00:22] <CluelessDevelope> Gotta hurry tho I get off from work in 15 minutes ;D
[06:00:28] <seb__> http://pelnosprawny.bialystok.pl/
[06:00:51] <CluelessDevelope> Polish i see
[06:00:58] <seb__> its the combobox on the right next to the small eyeglass
[06:00:59] <seb__> yea ^^
[06:01:38] <jop007> I have this <li class="il_navigate" id="4">Polisnummer :  - Verzekerde : Jansen - Place :  - Postcode : null - on my html page how to trap an onclick event on the li item?
[06:01:54] <CluelessDevelope> You should add some padding on the top of it so it's fully visible btw
[06:02:01] <Kartagis> do I still need access for fetching a remote json?
[06:02:02] <jop007> this doesn't work $('.il_navigate').click(function(e) {
[06:02:14] <Kartagis> or is that valid only for xml?
[06:02:53] <seb__> Yea, it`s under construction all the time. But time is burning
[06:04:30] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1ayr8vp7/ jop007 it works
[06:05:33] <jop007> great may be caused that the li item is injected on the page
[06:06:51] <jop007> this works   $(document).on('click', '.il_navigate', function() {
[06:06:55] <Kartagis> jop007: are you running this after it's injected?
[06:11:06] <CluelessDevelope> hey seb__ try this http://jsfiddle.net/dt6bv3p8/
[06:13:15] <CluelessDevelope> Oops typo http://jsfiddle.net/dt6bv3p8/1/
[06:15:22] <seb__> checking
[06:15:57] <CluelessDevelope> Hmm it won't work
[06:16:00] <CluelessDevelope> I know why
[06:16:14] <CluelessDevelope> It's also triggering on the opening click
[06:16:32] <CluelessDevelope> Just add && e.target !== whatever the opening thing is
[06:16:41] <CluelessDevelope> Either way sorry I can't help you finalise this
[06:16:45] <CluelessDevelope> But g2g home time
[06:17:06] <seb__> thanks mate have a nice day
[06:17:08] <seb__> !
[06:17:36] <NikoZz> has anybody used q.js or any other promises library?
[06:29:50] <Kartagis> do I still need to read cors on json fetch?
[06:32:55] <Kartagis> ?mdn cors
[06:32:55] <b-ot> Kartagis: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[06:36:48] <Kartagis> how is $.ajax{(url:... different from XML
[06:37:00] <Kartagis> how is $.ajax{(url:... different from XMLHTTPRequest?
[06:37:17] <Kartagis> XMLHttpRequest by the way
[06:40:29] <wheeei> whats the best way to create a mobile menu that collapses with a toggle? Im using jQuery and jQuery mobile already on the site
[06:41:38] <wheeei> thinking if I could use the accordion style for it
[06:58:48] <Verzlo> Anyone know how I could make a input field that works like the terminal input? Where you enter a key and the flashing icon moves to the right of the new character?
[07:01:19] <MikeD_> isn't that how an input works natively?
[07:02:21] <Verzlo> I want to have the icon move?
[07:03:47] <MikeD_> css cursor with a url to a blinking gif?
[07:04:04] <Verzlo> Got it working ^>^
[07:04:24] <MikeD_> url?
[07:04:30] <Verzlo> Also.. how can I plus add text to a span? I know I can set it by text(newVal); but how can I make it add to the val?
[07:04:35] <Verzlo> On local atm
[07:05:02] <Verzlo> I did it by adding a span before the flashing icon and adding text to that span
[07:05:03] <MikeD_> myspan.val( myspan.val() + "foo" )
[07:05:13] <hcker2000> do the eloquent create method return a model object or just the insert id?
[07:05:18] <hcker2000> does
[07:07:11] <Verzlo>      $('#enteredCommand').text(preval + e.key);
[07:07:18] <Verzlo> Should add the new val?
[07:07:34] <Verzlo> preval is var preval = $('#entereCommand').text()
[07:09:10] <Verzlo> Sweeet!
[07:09:30] <MikeD_> http://shachi.prophp.org/demo.html
[07:10:52] <Verzlo> How are they doing the deltet .-.
[07:10:57] <Verzlo> Cant find it in there tutoprial
[07:11:58] <MikeD_> idk, it's weird
[07:12:15] <Verzlo> How would you suggest
[07:12:16] <Verzlo> ?
[07:13:07] <MikeD_> if your client is willing to pay you to figure it out, then you have a cross to bear...  but if this is just a 'fun thing' to do, then I wouldn't do it.
[07:13:43] <MikeD_> even if it gets 95% of the way to perfect, the first 3 users that stumble over that last 5% are going to think you're a moron for breaking what they already know how to use and works well.
[07:13:59] <Verzlo> This is just something im trying out
[07:14:06] <Verzlo> Nobody is going to use it :p
[07:14:10] <MikeD_> oh
[07:14:29] <Verzlo> Trying to replicate the terminal basically..
[07:14:35] <Verzlo> Without taking any source code
[07:14:36] <MikeD_> i wish you had done yours in a jsfiddle
[07:14:44] <Verzlo> I could do that
[07:16:02] <Verzlo> http://jsfiddle.net/9o9L68k7/
[07:16:04] <Verzlo> There we go
[07:16:32] <Verzlo> Basic key input at the moment'
[07:18:41] <MikeD_> are you assuming people who use 'terminal' or 'command line' are going to not use their mouse?
[07:19:40] <Verzlo> No, I use terminal/command line and i use my mouse.. I just want text input only for this :P
[07:20:18] <MikeD_> if you click into the middle of whatever text is already there, the entry of more characters goes to the end
[07:20:48] <Verzlo> Yeah, I know
[07:20:54] <Verzlo> Like i said, just basic input at the moment.
[07:27:04] <MikeD_> it's an interesting project, i guess... but I have to get back to work  :)
[07:27:26] <MikeD_> having it live in a fiddle is a good way to show others while you're working on it
[07:27:43] <Verzlo> Ye
[07:27:53] <Verzlo> I will try to get the deltetion of chars working :P
[07:28:13] <Verzlo> Before you go, how would I check e.key against regex?
[07:28:18] <Verzlo> if(e.key = '/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z\d_]*$/')?
[07:28:21] <Verzlo> ==*
[07:28:58] <MikeD_> you probably should create a map of character codes to how you handle them
[07:29:27] <MikeD_> the normal characters are easy - it's all the other ones you have to noodle on
[07:29:32] <Verzlo> True..
[07:29:39] <Verzlo> Shift, control, alt .-.
[07:29:40] <Verzlo> XD
[07:29:45] <Verzlo> Anyway, cheers ^.%
[07:29:54] <MikeD_> if you are successful, i'd be expecting the up arrow to cycle through previous input submissions
[07:30:09] <Verzlo> mkay :P
[07:30:55] <MikeD_> if you wrapped each character added in its own span, you could trap clicking on each then know where the user is trying to insert
[07:31:23] <Verzlo> Good tip.
[07:31:24] <MikeD_> and if you have an internal representation of the input space, you can rewrite it not only "new character at the end" but any modifications you want
[07:31:32] <Verzlo> :D
[07:31:42] <Verzlo> .slice or .substring
[07:31:55] <Verzlo> preval.substring(0,preval.length - 1)
[07:32:53] <MikeD_> so yeah, you'll write a ton of code to manage what the <input> tag already handles  :)  but you will learn a lot
[07:33:14] <Verzlo> Ye ^.^
[07:33:21] <Verzlo> Hopefully it will all be useful aha
[07:33:45] <MikeD_> well, you probably should think about how you can generalize it to be useful - and build to that use-case
[07:33:53] <Verzlo> Yeah
[07:34:06] <Verzlo> Idea originally was to create a Web os sorta
[07:34:10] <Verzlo> and have a terminal ^.^
[07:34:20] <MikeD_> because if you keep going down the path you're just messing around on, you'll end up with something so in-grown to the messing-around use case, you'll never be able to package it up for a real purpose
[07:34:52] <Verzlo> Yeah
[07:35:03] <MikeD_> make a line to enter a command, then upon enter, have that line "submit" to a list and clear the entry line
[07:35:38] <Verzlo> Alrighty.. I shall do that now!
[07:36:16] <MikeD_> if you make it function like a tutorial of an actual linux shell session, it would be useful for "howto" to illustrate actually doing something
[07:36:35] <MikeD_> having a "replay" and "pause" from an actual list of steps would be pretty neat
[07:36:56] <MikeD_> but I just exploded the scope from "see if I can do it" to "damn, that's a lot of work"  :)
[07:37:08] <Verzlo> Yeah.. aha :P
[07:38:05] <MikeD_> feel free to PM me as you complete new functionality, it is interesting
[07:38:11] <Verzlo> :D
[07:38:13] <Verzlo> Okay!
[07:56:54] <Joshuabud> I am trying to figure out how to handle a sticky block wihen im mobile
[07:56:56] <Joshuabud> http://pastebin.com/wzRvQM0U
[07:57:42] <Joshuabud> I have it working perfectly in desktop viewer mode but it covers the content on mobile and I would like it to simply dropdown below content on mobile device
[07:59:31] <BillCriswell> Joshuabud: Instead of assigning css properties to the element use a class and then only do certain things based on media queries.
[08:00:15] <Joshuabud> Do you have a reference for working with jQuery in media queries or are you saying pull it out of jQuery and just use CSS?
[08:00:39] <Verzlo> Any idea why this doesnt change line number when I press enter? http://jsfiddle.net/nn1z082n/2/
[08:02:44] <BillCriswell> See how you're doing .css({ position: fixed, top: 85 }) ? Instead do like .addClass('fixed'); then in your css you can do shit like .fixed { position: fixed; top: 85px; } /* For small screens */ @media (min-height: 500px) { .fixed { top: 230px; }} /* adjustements for screens with more than 500px of height to work with */
[08:03:43] <Joshuabud> Awesome. Thank for the tips BillCriswell
[08:03:49] <BillCriswell> Joshuabud: No problem.
[08:06:46] <carnau> I want to know if there is some way to do this. var effect = $('#effect'); Then effect equals '<div id="one"><div id="two" class="changeme"></div></div>'. Could I then change class changeme to anotherone calling effect.whatervermethod()?
[08:09:41] <BillCriswell> carnau: effect.find('.changeme').removeClass('changeme').addClass('newclass'); can work..
[08:10:37] <creativename> sup
[08:11:01] <creativename> am I missing something  $('#feat').attr('src','/img/preview.jpg'); doesnt change the src of my image
[08:11:29] <BillCriswell> creativename: Does your image have id="feat" on it?
[08:11:39] <creativename> ahh
[08:11:50] <BillCriswell> also, are you sure it's available when you query it?
[08:11:58] <carnau> BillCriswell, will try, than you!
[08:12:08] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:13:28] <creativename> hmm alright I just switched it to be the id
[08:13:34] <creativename> but still doesnt work
[08:13:45] <creativename> <img src= "/img/preview.jpg" alt="art object image" id="featimg"></a>
[08:13:45] <carnau> creativename, You can paste your code in the console and see if it throws an error.
[08:14:06] <BillCriswell> creativename: You'd need id="feat", not id="featimg"
[08:14:19] <creativename> yeah I just switched it to featimg
[08:14:21] <creativename> $('#featimg').attr('src','/img/preview.jpg');
[08:14:43] <creativename> what code should I throw in the console?
[08:14:56] <carnau> $('#featimg').attr('src','/img/preview.jpg');
[08:15:07] <BillCriswell> Are you running it in document ready? or is your script before the </body> tag? You need to make sure the element is available when you're asking for it.
[08:18:07] <creativename> [context: document, selector: "#featimg", jquery: "1.11.1", constructor: function, toArray: function…]
[08:18:16] <creativename> my console returned that
[08:18:56] <BillCriswell> Doing it in the console wouldn't help since the element might have been added later. You need to know where you're running the code.
[08:19:41] <creativename> omg im sorry I forgot imredrawing the image when I press the edit button
[08:19:50] <creativename> forgot to pass the id to it
[08:22:46] <carnau> So, #featimg it's not in the original DOM? Then you have to bind the event on new created elements.
[08:23:10] <carnau> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements
[08:23:17] <robertmaxrees> or use event delegation.
[08:42:22] <Rainb> what are the different types of Nodes in DOM?
[08:42:36] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType
[08:44:12] <Rainb> woof
[08:44:19] <robertmaxrees> that answer your question? ;)
[08:44:24] <Rainb> ya
[08:44:28] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[08:44:36] <robertmaxrees> MDN is one of my favorite things of all time.
[08:48:31] <Rainb> didn't know there were so many nodes
[08:49:03] <robertmaxrees> yep, though you normally don't directly interact with nodetypes in practice.
[08:49:13] <Rainb> What does the thumbs down mean
[08:49:18] <Rainb> You don't?
[08:49:41] <robertmaxrees> the alt text explains the thumbsdown, but those are deprecated.
[08:49:46] <robertmaxrees> and i rarely interact with nodetypes.
[08:53:13] <Rainb> Well, I'd say nodetypes are good if you want to infer what type of node you're given
[08:53:50] <robertmaxrees> i never said they're not good, but i rarely don't know what node i'm working with.
[08:54:20] <Rainb> guess making a function which accepts a node wasn't a good idea after all
[08:54:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[08:54:34] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing?
[08:55:31] <Rainb> Uhhm
[08:56:03] <Rainb> I'm making a constructor that gets the attributes, of the element and puts them into an object
[08:56:09] <Rainb> to, uh.
[08:56:38] <Rainb> well, like a little small dom copy of the elements to interact less with the dom
[08:56:52] <robertmaxrees> that already exists :)
[08:57:02] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment
[08:57:13] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jQuery, it's even easier.
[08:58:52] <Rainb> oh, but I also am making like a wrapper of that, so that when I have a data-structure, and want to HTMLize it, I still don't
[08:58:59] <Rainb> have to go to the dom
[08:59:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery handles that for you already.
[08:59:18] <Rainb> well, shit
[09:01:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9a4v303b/1/
[09:04:36] <Rainb> didn't know jQuery init accepted attributes as second parameter
[09:05:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you can do all sorts of stuff with that object. check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[09:05:24] <robertmaxrees> $() does a lot more than people teem to think.
[09:08:02] <Rainb> $("<!---->",{text:"dunno lol"})
[09:09:35] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/92af5998cb3f177fb42c what gives?
[09:09:45] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/92af5998cb3f177fb42c what gives?
[09:10:03] <robertmaxrees> .link.on('mouseover', function () { isn't valid.
[09:10:23] <robertmaxrees> what is that supposed to be?
[09:10:58] <Rainb> I havent tried react.js
[09:10:59] <robertmaxrees> oh.  you want $('.link').on('mouseenter', function() {
[09:11:01] <Rainb> too confus
[09:11:40] <robertmaxrees> hd1 though that won't work either because the html won't yet exist.  you need a document ready.
[09:11:54] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use //code.jquery.com/jquery-git1.min.js for jquery
[09:12:02] <Rainb> best part of $.fn.on is that second parameter can be a selector, so you decide which elements get to be listened
[09:12:06] <Rainb> that's just too good
[09:12:28] <robertmaxrees> hd1 and finally, your ajax code doesnt' really make sense and likely won't work in most of those cases.
[09:12:52] <robertmaxrees> Rainb yeah, the delegated syntax of .on() is really powerful.
[09:13:56] <hd1> what should i use, robertmaxrees?
[09:14:35] <robertmaxrees> use //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js
[09:14:53] <robertmaxrees> or one of the CDN links from the jquery team.
[09:15:40] <robertmaxrees> you also don't need that $().each
[09:16:00] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do here?
[09:16:40] <Rainb> robertmaxrees: Okay, I'll tell you. What I am really doing. I want to represent a Tree data structure, in HTML, I want it to have uhh, collapsible buttons, want it to be searchable, as it's very big. My issue is deciding how the tree structure should be, aaand, implementing it all
[09:17:03] <robertmaxrees> how big is it?
[09:17:18] <robertmaxrees> do you have a simplified example of what you're doing?
[09:17:34] <Rainb> about 2500 'nodes', like in all
[09:17:40] <Rainb> it's not that big
[09:17:42] <Rainb> it's still big
[09:18:02] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty big.  any reason you aren't doing most of this server-side?  are you sure your UI is optimal?
[09:19:03] <Rainb> what UI? :^(
[09:19:07] <Rainb> lol
[09:19:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[09:19:13] <Imaginativeone> How do I replace a tab?
[09:20:47] <Rainb> robertmaxrees: My idea was that you could search something, with an autocomplete search bar, and when you selected a node, the browser would uncollapse the node you wanted, would scroll to it, and would highlight it
[09:20:59] <Rainb> robertmaxrees: and you'd be like, "oh, cool"
[09:21:47] <Rainb> robertmaxrees: but I can't think of a generic tree data structure that would work for all things tree data structure so I wouldn't have to write code twice
[09:22:16] <robertmaxrees> Rainb you should probably rething that UX and UI, but meh.
[09:22:28] <robertmaxrees> if you can pull that off, more power to you :)
[09:23:03] <Rainb> robertmaxrees: how should I rething the ux, (any help appreciated, seriously)
[09:23:46] <robertmaxrees> why does the end user need to see the entire tree structure in the first place?
[09:24:20] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/92af5998cb3f177fb42c
[09:24:35] <robertmaxrees> hd1 jQuery - lowercase J
[09:25:33] <Rainb> They're accounts, as in accounting, it's kinda hard to explain, but basically, the user would need to search for an account, that "sounds" similar to what they want, and the program would try to guess, what accounts they need. They would still need to see the siblings, and parent accounts
[09:25:37] <Rainb> it's messy, I think
[09:25:41] <Rainb> but yup
[09:25:53] <robertmaxrees> Rainb then your account pages should show that data.
[09:25:59] <robertmaxrees> but not a full tree structure of everything.
[09:27:34] <Rainb> I'd guess users, would also search, categorically uncollapsing the accounts they need, in order to find what they want, pretty much like how devs, inspect HTML code, in dev tools, like, you can uncollapse elements and stuff
[09:27:49] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's your misstep ;)
[09:27:54] <Rainb> wat
[09:27:55] <robertmaxrees> end users can't hjandle that much data.
[09:28:20] <Rainb> yeah, well, all data would be uncollapsed, and stuff
[09:28:45] <robertmaxrees> normal users are not at all like deveopers.
[09:28:57] <robertmaxrees> a treeview like that with that much data will overwhelm them is my point.
[09:29:23] <Rainb> What they do now is they search the accounts they need in books, all the data is uncollapsed and they have to look through hundrends of accounts in order to find the account they need.
[09:29:30] <Rainb> Basically, I'm adding a ctrl+f to that book
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> give them an autocomplete search instead.  trust me.
[09:29:59] <robertmaxrees> i've worked on enough treeviews and search systems to know at this point.
[09:30:14] <robertmaxrees> represent the relationships with as much context as possible.
[09:30:22] <hd1> robertmaxrees: thanks, mate
[09:30:28] <robertmaxrees> hd1 sure
[09:30:54] * hd1 still despises javascript, but is hoping to make it a dislike very, very soon
[09:31:08] <robertmaxrees> hd1 you're actually making things hard on yourself there fwiw :)
[09:32:24] <Rainb> Also, I would like the data to be loaded, so it's fast
[09:32:48] <robertmaxrees> Rainb then you certainly want to avoid what you're doing now.
[09:33:03] <robertmaxrees> if you're really attached to this treeview, you need to setup as much lazy loading as possible.
[09:33:32] <Rainb> So, don't load elements in dom, before they're needed
[09:34:09] <robertmaxrees> don't load them at all - ajax data in as needed.
[09:34:17] <Rainb> >le slow
[09:34:54] <Rainb> It should be offline too, for internet reasons.
[09:34:57] <Rainb> :/
[09:35:02] <robertmaxrees> your autocomplete search idea is going to really kill it.
[09:35:22] <Rainb> what do you mean
[09:35:41] <hd1> robertmaxrees: how's that?
[09:36:26] <robertmaxrees> Rainb you're going to parse through 2000+ items in-browser and expect that to go well?
[09:36:43] <robertmaxrees> hd1 i'm guessing that you want to do something on each of those links when you hover over one?
[09:37:35] <Rainb> browsers, don't parse html already
[09:37:38] <Rainb> wat
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> Rainb i'm talking purely from a performance standpoint.
[09:38:06] <robertmaxrees> but go ahead ;)
[09:40:08] <Rainb> well, there's dat site, which already does what you want me to do, the only problem is, internet goes away every 10 secs, and takes hours loading
[09:40:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why not fix those problems then?
[09:40:40] <Rainb> how
[09:40:54] <robertmaxrees> figure out why your internet connection is dying every 10 seconds.
[09:41:02] <robertmaxrees> and why those pages take hours to load.
[09:41:24] <Rainb> externalities, I suppose.
[09:41:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:41:43] <robertmaxrees> so your internet connection goes out every 10 seconds and this is "normal"?
[09:42:07] <Rainb> well, ya, cellular data isn't dat reliable
[09:43:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that you're in a remote location or something similar.  either way, you should really consider using ajax to send over small bits of JSON and render that out instead.
[09:43:13] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be MUCH faster than what you're doing now.
[09:43:21] <robertmaxrees> that minimizes network overhead.
[09:44:01] <Rainb> I'd have the page saved, offline, so don't have to rely on the internet
[09:44:05] <Rainb> Basically like an app
[09:44:07] <Rainb> or something
[09:44:26] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd strongly encourage you to rethink that stance if it really takes hours to load the whole thing.
[09:45:10] <Rainb> it takes hours, online, offline, it takes like 3 seconds or less to load it, if I already have it
[09:45:55] <Rainb> Also, I need to process stuff with the data too, I do, guess that will be slower
[09:46:49] <Rainb> Well, I'm just trying to work, on some ridiculous set of parameters, so, yeah, you're probably right on many things.
[09:50:34] <cranderson> dunkel2: that means your request it outside your domain a.k.a localhost
[09:50:47] <cranderson> are you pinging a remote server?
[09:53:10] <wahibdon> I load the script with the src http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.js
[09:53:19] <cranderson> Yo, so I'm checking to see if the .offset is at 0px (Y) with .scroll() if thats the case then do an animation(), but when you over scroll to the top it queues all the animations that met that condition. is there a way just to take the last animation for that condition?
[09:53:21] <wahibdon> and yet, $() throws an error
[09:53:34] <robertmaxrees> wahibdon is your code before or after the script tag?
[09:53:39] <cranderson> ^^
[09:54:01] <wahibdon> what do you mean?  the src is INSIDE the script tag
[09:54:09] <robertmaxrees> that's... not valid.
[09:54:24] <robertmaxrees> you need two script tags.  one to load jquery.  then a second one after for your code.
[09:54:34] <cranderson> i think he means the attribute src is in the script tag
[09:54:54] <wahibdon> okay, yes.  my code is pulled in from another script tagg
[09:55:07] <robertmaxrees> does that tag come after the jquery include?
[09:55:10] <wahibdon> yes
[09:55:16] <wahibdon> and in the chrome console
[09:55:29] <robertmaxrees> can you paste up a fixee?
[09:55:35] <robertmaxrees> because that's really... strange.
[09:55:46] <wahibdon> <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:55:51] <wahibdon> that is what I have
[09:55:55] <wahibdon> then i type $()
[09:55:58] <wahibdon> and get an error
[09:56:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[09:56:10] <wahibdon> VM2992:2 Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[09:56:30] <cranderson> wahibdon: http://pastebin.com/YGqVdrj7
[09:56:30] <robertmaxrees> ah - are you loading this from a file on your hard drive?
[09:56:35] <robertmaxrees> or through a server?
[09:56:46] <cranderson> needs to be in that order
[09:56:55] <wahibdon> robertmaxrees, from a website
[09:57:10] <wahibdon> it is on a server http://coxssomkers.com
[09:57:22] <robertmaxrees> that url looks nsfw
[09:57:30] <cranderson> LOL
[09:57:43] <wahibdon> cranderson, yes I know the order
[09:57:47] * cranderson steps away from this
[09:57:50] <robertmaxrees> share the page source, then.
[09:57:50] <wahibdon> and it is a tobacco store
[09:57:59] <robertmaxrees> because something isn't adding up.
[09:58:16] <wahibdon> if you want to see the source, by all means.  but I promise the site is safe for work.
[09:58:22] <cranderson> i just clocked on it
[09:58:27] <cranderson> clicked* doesnt work
[09:58:33] <robertmaxrees> i went to that URL and got a "server not found"
[09:58:46] <cranderson> we can viruses somehow
[09:58:49] <cranderson> got*
[09:58:52] <rcyr> o_O
[09:58:54] <cranderson> lol
[09:58:59] <rcyr> cocksmokers? :/
[09:59:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[09:59:09] <wahibdon> cox
[09:59:13] <robertmaxrees> kind of... uncool.  wahibdon just make a fiddle pls.
[09:59:13] <wahibdon> not cocks
[09:59:16] <rcyr> That's sooo winner.
[09:59:26] <wahibdon> I am trying robertmaxrees
[09:59:30] <robertmaxrees> not "winner" - kind of offensive, but w/e
[09:59:43] <wahibdon> It is a dude's last name!
[09:59:45] <cranderson> wahibdon, you should consider a different business name.
[09:59:47] <wahibdon> *sigh*
[09:59:53] <cranderson> hahaha
[09:59:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking to rcyr, not you.
[09:59:56] <wahibdon> it is not my business, cranderson
[09:59:57] <robertmaxrees> but whatever.
[10:00:03] <robertmaxrees> back on topic.
[10:00:06] <wahibdon> okay, I am trying to copy the source
[10:00:18] <cranderson> yeah do a coxfiddle and we'll help
[10:00:20] <wahibdon> just give me a minute.  for some reason the google developer console is not... behaving.
[10:00:24] <robertmaxrees> wait - what happens if you do jQuery.fn.jquery in the console
[10:00:38] <wahibdon> 1.5.2
[10:00:39] <rcyr> robertmaxrees: I know it's kind of offensive :) But i can't write <sarcasm>content</sarcasm> everytime :(
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> wahibdon that's the issue - noconflict mode is turned on.
[10:01:15] <robertmaxrees> rcyr sorry, but we kind of frown on that kind of behavior.
[10:02:04] <rcyr> Ah damn... Thought I was on another channel, my bad.
[10:02:11] <robertmaxrees> it's OK ;)
[10:02:41] <robertmaxrees> anyway, wahibdon don't need to see the page source, you're just in noconflict mode.  you can wrap your code in an IIFE that lets you use $ if it's important to you.
[10:02:53] <wahibdon> cranderson, it is singular.  it is coxssmoker.com
[10:02:57] <robertmaxrees> or you could consider turning off noconflict mode, but that might cause headaches.
[10:03:21] <wahibdon> robertmaxrees, the problem is this is a drupal install.  I will probably have to turn no clonflict mode off in there.
[10:03:25] <wahibdon> *conflict
[10:03:40] <robertmaxrees> either/or.  but that's your problem.
[10:03:49] <wahibdon> indeed it is.  thanks for the heads up
[10:03:51] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:04:09] <wahibdon> fsho?
[10:04:15] <robertmaxrees> "for sure"
[10:04:34] <wahibdon> ah, portmanteau not acronym.
[10:05:39] <cranderson> i word in drupal, doing that is no problem man
[10:05:43] <cranderson> work*
[10:05:50] <cranderson> im done trying to type today
[10:06:07] <wahibdon> what does this: src="http://coxssmokers.com/misc/jquery.once.js?v=1.2" mean?
[10:06:23] <robertmaxrees> not sure that you mean
[10:06:31] <robertmaxrees> that's probably loading a plugin or something.
[10:06:35] <wahibdon> is that loading another jQuery?
[10:06:39] <wahibdon> ah, okay.
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> nope - hit that URL.
[10:07:29] <cranderson> wahibdon , try using jQuery('elem');
[10:07:39] <robertmaxrees> cranderson we already established this :)
[10:07:48] * cranderson sigh
[10:07:50] <cranderson> lol
[10:08:12] <wahibdon> that works fine
[10:08:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can use jQuery instead of $.  you could also wrap your code with (function($) { /* your code here */ }(jQuery)); and leave noconflict mode alone.
[10:09:17] <cranderson> robertmaxress is a man of much help.
[10:09:25] <cranderson> you should do that breh
[10:09:42] <robertmaxrees> or, if you need a doc ready, you can do jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ });
[10:09:52] <cranderson> wahidbon: i work with drupal and i do the latter
[10:10:07] <wahibdon> robertmaxrees, I would love to do that.  HOWEVER, it is a built in part of drupal that is having the trouble.
[10:10:08] <robertmaxrees> be careful not to wrap EVERYTHING in a doc ready though.
[10:10:12] <Kartagis> would I be subjectto same origin policy if I am fetching a remote json off mobile?
[10:10:20] <wahibdon> I feel like it would be easier to get this working than rewrite drupal
[10:10:26] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis is the "remote json" on another domain?
[10:10:36] <Kartagis> yes
[10:10:43] <robertmaxrees> then you're subject to CORS
[10:11:06] <Kartagis> ?mdn cors
[10:11:07] <b-ot> Kartagis: CORS - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[10:11:21] <robertmaxrees> CORS comes into play whenever the page you're running ajax from isn't on the same port, protocol, or domain as the place you're requesting it from.
[10:12:02] <cranderson> wahibdon: var $ = jQuery.noConflict(); i think that would be a work around
[10:12:16] <Kartagis> if I'm on mobile, what's my domain? my mobile operator's?
[10:12:31] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis huh?
[10:12:39] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[10:12:47] <robertmaxrees> "domain" as in "the page you're currently on"
[10:13:03] <Kartagis> gotcha,
[10:13:52] <Kartagis> does CORS also apply if I download it?
[10:14:00] <robertmaxrees> download what?
[10:14:08] <Kartagis> the json
[10:14:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about what CORS is i think.
[10:16:01] <Kartagis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3499597/javascript-jquery-to-download-file-via-post-with-json-data
[10:16:15] <robertmaxrees> back up - what are you trying to do?
[10:16:40] <wahibdon> cranderson, robertmaxrees, I was loading two versions of jQuery
[10:16:48] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it too, wahibdon
[10:17:00] <wahibdon> yeah, now I have to figure out how to fix that.
[10:17:10] <cranderson> crazy man, crazy...you wild.
[10:17:25] <robertmaxrees> kill the older version.
[10:17:26] <robertmaxrees> have a party.
[10:17:33] <cranderson> lol
[10:17:44] <cranderson> wahibhon what drupal version are you working with
[10:17:57] <Kartagis> okay, I have a Drupal site which produces a json file of products. my intention is make a cordova project to fetch that json, parse it, and show with mustache
[10:18:08] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: ^
[10:18:27] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah, you need to read the cordova docs then.
[10:18:30] <abio> I need query ebooks
[10:18:39] <robertmaxrees> lean.jquery.com abio
[10:18:43] <robertmaxrees> also look for javascript books.
[10:18:49] <robertmaxrees> err, learn.jquery.com
[10:18:56] <abio> if anyone can help it would be appreciated
[10:19:12] <wahibdon> he... just did.

[11:33:40] <islalobo> Can I use this channel to get AJAX help
[11:34:58] <robertmaxrees> you can ask :)
[11:35:03] <robertmaxrees> whether or not we can help is a different matter.
[11:44:09] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: Sweet
[11:44:15] <islalobo> So
[11:44:25] <islalobo> I think I was talking with you yesterday :)
[11:45:28] <islalobo> About 'passing a variable' to a form. Which I have accomplished, however, the submit function aren't working and I think it is because as the code is now there are multiple instances of the same form rendered on the page and I am assuming this is causing a conflict (maybe)?
[11:45:39] <islalobo> Here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc156a5ef497137bd96b
[11:46:08] <islalobo> That is the generated html (list items and call to get the form and a wee bit of js to show/hide)
[11:46:31] <islalobo> (Sorry that it is so 'tabbed' and spacious….)
[11:47:10] <islalobo> And the comment should say 'form submit is NOT working correctly'
[11:48:35] <islalobo> My thinking is that if the php call to get the form is an AJAX call (I don't quite understand AJAX) it would only get rendered when the user hits 'edit' and since only one item is shown at a time, only one form will get rendered at any one time…? mayber....
[11:49:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused about what the issue is.
[11:49:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any js related to form submission.
[11:50:11] <Uhkis> islalobo: dude, even drupal formatting guidelines say tab = 2 spaces :P
[11:50:19] <islalobo> The form instance is getting rendered more than one time and I think it is mucking up the submit function. So I'm trying to think of a way that only one instance of the form will exist at any time
[11:50:23] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis and at my company we use tab = tab ;)
[11:50:38] <robertmaxrees> islalobo show a simplified example of the HTML and your JS.
[11:50:43] <islalobo> Uhkis I know! I'm sorry! I was doing it fast :/ I'll correct
[11:50:51] <robertmaxrees> islalobo slow down.
[11:50:57] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: the horror!
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis i prefer it.
[11:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i can configure my editor to show indentation at any width.
[11:51:34] <robertmaxrees> instead of enforcing my preference, everybody gets what they want.
[11:51:34] <Uhkis> !demo @ islalobo
[11:51:35] <b-ot> islalobo: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:51:43] <islalobo> okay, I'm mocking up a simplified version, one second
[11:52:54] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: but in this case _drupal_ "enforces" that cleaner version :P
[11:53:40] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis i disagree that 2 space tab is "cleaner".
[11:55:00] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: cleaner than that random tab mess
[11:55:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:55:40] <robertmaxrees> hold up - i still adhere pretty strictly to levels of indentation.
[11:55:56] <robertmaxrees> but i disagree that 2 space tabs are a good thing. plenty of people disagree - that's OK.
[11:56:43] <Uhkis> i used to 4 space but then i got this drupal day job, now i can't anything but 2 space :D
[11:57:16] <robertmaxrees> whatever works best for your organization.
[11:58:52] <Uhkis> drupal community  actually
[11:58:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:59:00] <robertmaxrees> you know what i mean ;)
[11:59:17] <Uhkis> still better than no guidelines at all!
[11:59:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:59:31] <robertmaxrees> my companies' guidelines  say use a tab.
[12:00:26] <robertmaxrees> as is an actual tab stop, not spaces.
[12:05:19] <MrSavage> how can i access the text on this node? https://i.imgur.com/N8KjakW.png
[12:05:32] <MrSavage> I'm not sure what selector to use
[12:07:34] <Uhkis> $('.pageLinks a:last-child') ?
[12:07:42] <Uhkis> .text() after it of course
[12:08:10] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[12:08:57] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298750/how-do-i-select-text-nodes-with-jquery start by reading this.
[12:09:41] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/hd90rt42/
[12:09:44] <robertmaxrees> that .filter() callback will need to do something like if this.nodeType === 3 && !$(this).parent('a').length
[12:10:04] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:10:16] <robertmaxrees> islalobo what does this have to do with your question before?
[12:10:30] <islalobo> it is a working demo
[12:10:44] <robertmaxrees> you keep talking about "forms" but i don't see any in here.
[12:10:55] <islalobo> Well, I don't need to show it
[12:11:15] <robertmaxrees> lol so what's the problem we're solving here?
[12:11:25] <islalobo> The issue isn't the form, I want to render it only once at any given time
[12:11:41] <islalobo> Currently in the code it is rendered on page load for each listed item
[12:11:44] <robertmaxrees> so you only want one thing to toggle open at a time?
[12:12:00] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "i don't need to show the form" but then to you keep referencing it.
[12:12:00] <islalobo> Well, the only show one item at a time
[12:12:19] <islalobo> The actual code has a php function that calls gets the form
[12:12:34] <islalobo> *that makes a call to get the form
[12:12:48] <robertmaxrees> that part is irrelevant once the page is loaded fwiw.
[12:12:51] <islalobo> so on page load there are as many instances of the form as their are items on the page
[12:12:57] <Uhkis> islalobo: i think you should be looking at this https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!ajax.inc/group/ajax/7 instead of your own jquery implementation
[12:13:11] <robertmaxrees> islalobo okay, so you have a bunch of forms.  what's the issue?
[12:14:28] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: that didn't give me the text node
[12:14:41] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage right - you'll have to update it for your particular use case.
[12:14:46] <robertmaxrees> that wasn't like 100%.
[12:14:50] <MrSavage> ah
[12:14:54] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I've told you what the issue is already. I only want to ever have one instance of the form at any given time.
[12:15:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry, you aren't being clear about what that means.  do you want it so any open forms close when you hit the edit button?
[12:16:30] <islalobo> sure, but that I already have in place.
[12:16:43] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:16:49] <robertmaxrees> then what are you asking?
[12:17:07] <islalobo> It already functions like that, but the forms are all still rendered on the page.....
[12:17:16] <islalobo> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc156a5ef497137bd96b
[12:17:30] <robertmaxrees> so you want to ajax in things on an as-needed basis, instead of on pageload?
[12:17:36] <islalobo> the foreach lists the item, it's related information and renders a form in a hidden div
[12:17:41] <islalobo> yeah
[12:18:02] <robertmaxrees> why?  what benefit will that give you?
[12:18:38] <islalobo> When more than one instance of the same form is rendered on the same page the submit function seems to muck up
[12:18:49] <robertmaxrees> loading things via ajax won't fix that brokne.
[12:18:51] <robertmaxrees> *problem.
[12:19:03] <Uhkis> what islalobo wants is something that should be done on the php-side with drupals form/ajax api
[12:20:36] <islalobo> Uhkis: so I should go to the drupal channel
[12:20:53] <Uhkis> islalobo: i'd say #drupal-support is your best bet :)
[12:22:54] <islalobo> Uhkis: thanks
[12:24:26] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage if you haven't gotten it yet: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zr3p8a0c/1/
[12:25:04] <MrSavage> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:46:28] <MrSavage> how do i properly check if a node contains some text? I'm trying $(".btn_green_white_innerfade:contains('joinlobby')");
[12:46:41] <MrSavage> but it doesn't seem to work, i took in account of case sensitive
[12:47:38] <cranderson> $("elem").html()
[12:47:44] <cranderson> != ' ';
[12:57:11] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: when I do a typical ajax GET, does it also retrieve all data from the URL like images, etc?
[12:57:33] <MrSavage> Because I'm unsure if i have to set my ajax settings so that only html is obtained and then certain other things are rendered
[12:57:45] <MrSavage> like images or whatever
[12:59:41] <rcyr> It only gets the HTML... and that HTML is just a string that does nothing until you "parse it" to a DOM
[13:00:16] <MrSavage> thanks rcyr
[13:20:30] <p-trust> is there any ajax-only-based irc client? i mean pure js, without any backend
[13:22:24] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> actually, probably not now that i think about it.
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> woah - http://www.wsirc.com/ looks like it might be feasible.
[13:32:39] <p-trust> it does use backend
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> ah, yep. missed that part.
[13:32:56] <p-trust> connection doesn't originate from a brwser
[13:33:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.  good catch.
[13:33:39] <robertmaxrees> probably some kind of limitation about the protocol itself.
[13:33:43] <p-trust> well, some people say it's not possible because of old cross origin restrictions, but with modern jquery i think it's possible
[13:33:55] <robertmaxrees> cross-origin has nothing to do with jquery.
[13:34:28] <p-trust> it's browsers limitation ?
[13:34:49] <robertmaxrees> browser and server.
[13:40:19] <forQuery> so i have some <li> that I am appending inside a foreach.  I am trying to append them once at the end of the foreach.
[13:40:24] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10072435  this is before vs after
[13:40:35] <forQuery> before it works, after it does not... mayb someone might have idea why?
[13:41:13] <nielsNLc> hello, i'm searching for a way to scroll the screen like on a tablet where you can put your finger all over the screen to scroll but now on a normal screen
[13:42:22] <nielsNLc> does anyone know a control that allows that?
[13:42:30] <forQuery> nielsNLC, so you want that rubber band type scroll?
[13:43:05] <forQuery> similar to when you scroll on http://www.bloodlist.com/?
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> forQuery make a simplified example in a fiddle.
[13:45:47] <nielsNLc> yes forQuery but then only horizontal and tge whole page
[13:47:09] <forQuery> sry about pm, didnt know.  thx, ill try create one.
[13:49:12] <MrSavage> I'm having asynchronous issues https://jsfiddle.net/93noxhwL/1/
[13:49:33] <MrSavage> trying to get the max page number but i'm waiting on filter function to finish
[13:49:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:49:52] <robertmaxrees> filter isn't async.
[13:49:58] <MrSavage> oh?
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/93noxhwL/2/
[13:50:41] <MrSavage> nevermind
[13:59:04] <rubyonrailed> Why is jquery returning my selected option value with a bunch of white space?  "                                My option"
[14:06:10] <sacho_> because that's your option's value
[14:12:18] <MrSavage> How can I get my ajax success function to update a count per a request?
[14:12:48] <MrSavage> I'm trying to update a global var in the script
[14:15:49] <MrSavage> the problem i seem be having is that I'm using $.when.apply on all my GETs, and the variable isn't being updated before the checking
[14:16:12] <ThePendulum> Peculiar. The .on('input') event doesn't seem to fire in IE11 for a range input
[14:16:18] <MrSavage> my function so far https://jsfiddle.net/8n6t1ttk/1/
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> woah
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> this is.. interesting.
[14:21:45] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing success and .when()
[14:23:27] <MrSavage> lol
[14:25:12] <hazardous> hi, i have some input elements .prepend()ed - .children('div :input').each() does not see them at all
[14:25:24] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ hazardous
[14:25:25] <b-ot> hazardous: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:25:32] <sacho_> it looks like you really enjoy indentation.
[14:26:00] <MrSavage> me?
[14:26:46] <sacho_> yes
[14:27:13] <MrSavage> lol
[14:28:14] <MrSavage> can't help out vim autoindents
[14:28:15] <sacho_> you're adding items to list after you've called $.when.apply()
[14:28:27] <sacho_> vim didn't write your code.
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> also, reconfigure the tool to work better.
[14:29:16] <sacho_> I always find it weird when people mix the callback arguments for $.ajax *and* use the promise
[14:29:22] <sacho_> the promise is a complete replacement for them
[14:29:24] <robertmaxrees> i was just saying that.
[14:30:01] <MrSavage> so i shouldn't use $.when?
[14:30:12] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use success:
[14:30:18] <MrSavage> ah
[14:30:19] <sacho_> MrSavage, at any rate, your problem is that the time when you actually add items to gets which make the requests to $profileUrl, you've already called $.when.apply(gets)
[14:30:32] <sacho_> s/the time/by the time
[14:31:03] <MrSavage> i see
[14:31:10] <MrSavage> i'm not so good with async, thanks
[14:31:22] <robertmaxrees> also: avoid globals - they make async even harder to with with.
[14:31:56] <sacho_> MrSavage, try refactoring your code so it looks something like this
[14:32:55] <sacho_> gets.push($.get(groupUrl).then(function (response) { // ....... return $.ajax($profileUrl) }).then(function (response) { // nRetrieved part })
[14:34:29] <MrSavage> sacho_: but robertmaxrees says not to use success
[14:34:49] <robertmaxrees> where is he using success there?
[14:35:01] <MrSavage> i assumed .then is like success
[14:35:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> success is a specific thing.
[14:35:16] <robertmaxrees> done() was replaced by it.
[14:35:20] <robertmaxrees> err, oither way around.
[14:35:27] <robertmaxrees> success was replaced by done.
[14:35:37] <sacho_> MrSavage, https://jsfiddle.net/jnj9f7k8/
[14:36:05] <sacho_> unfortunately, you'll lose some indentation.
[14:37:03] <MrSavage> lol
[14:39:12] <MrSavage> just trying to understand this atm
[14:40:19] <sacho_> MrSavage, I find it easy to reason about promises if you think of them as "a promise for value X"
[14:40:31] <sacho_> thus, $.get() returns a promise for an http response
[14:40:42] <MrSavage> I don't get the return $.ajax({})
[14:41:03] <sacho_> MrSavage, .then(fn) returns a new promise for the value that fn returns.
[14:41:25] <sacho_> so $.get().then(function () { return $.ajax }) is a promise for the http response of $.ajax
[14:43:01] <sacho_> should probably say "returns a", not "is a".
[14:43:02] <MrSavage> what
[14:43:17] <cranderson> http://pastebin.com/BzPzsMse : so when keyup event is triggered jQuery executes console.log() foreach character that gets enetered into the text field. why is that?
[14:43:23] <MrSavage> "is a promise for the http response of $.ajax" what?
[14:43:32] <cranderson> shouldnt just execute for the entire string once?
[14:44:07] <sacho_> cranderson, a keyup event is triggered when you release a key.
[14:44:19] <cranderson> i understand that
[14:44:53] <robertmaxrees> cranderson you're binding on every focus event.
[14:44:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:45:02] <cranderson> but "a" , "as" , "asd" : executed once, twice, thrice, when you're only adding once character
[14:45:20] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to bind.
[14:45:21] <cranderson> so only one event should trigger but its triggering for each character
[14:45:28] <cranderson> ahh okay
[14:45:31] <cranderson> tips?
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing it this way?
[14:46:31] <cranderson> what im trying to is implement a search feature
[14:46:45] <cranderson> in real time
[14:46:54] <cranderson> with content that exist on the page
[14:46:56] <MrSavage> sacho_: your code took me a while to understand
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> why are you binding the keyup inside the focus?
[14:47:39] <cranderson> so when the user focus on the input field that keyup event begins
[14:47:50] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[14:47:55] <robertmaxrees> just bind to the keyup instead.
[14:48:03] <cranderson> lots of what i do doesnt make sense
[14:48:11] <cranderson> okay lemme try that
[14:50:14] <MrSavage> sacho_: in your example, doesn't the $.ajax not get added to GETs?
[14:51:34] <cranderson> robertmaxress: you da man
[14:55:16] <MrSavage> for this example, how can I work with multiple $.gets in this? https://jsfiddle.net/jnj9f7k8/
[14:55:38] <MrSavage> would I just return an array of the return values of $.get?
[14:56:56] <sacho_> you could use $.when.apply()
[14:58:38] <MrSavage> but then that's where i would be where i started
[15:00:23] <sacho_> not really..?
[15:00:24] <MrSavage> sacho_: oh you mean inside the .then()?
[15:00:33] <sacho_> yes.
[15:00:38] <MrSavage> thanks
[15:01:05] <sacho_> you'd just do return $.when.apply(arrayofpromises) instead of return $.ajax()
[15:02:45] <DragonPunch> okay guys..what is this.
[15:03:14] <DragonPunch> i'm adding a form dynamically via AJAX i have a listener setup for when the form is submitted to do e.preventdefault();
[15:03:30] <robertmaxrees> you need a delegated listener.
[15:03:31] <DragonPunch> however, the e.preventdefault(); is not working for the forms that are dynamically added.
[15:03:47] <robertmaxrees> since you can only bind to things that exist at time of binding.
[15:03:59] <DragonPunch> robert hwo do i do that?
[15:04:00] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('submit', 'form', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[15:04:09] <robertmaxrees> where "parent" is a parent node that exists on pageload.
[15:04:10] <DragonPunch> thats what i have
[15:04:29] <DragonPunch> ah
[15:04:30] <DragonPunch> okay
[15:04:30] <DragonPunch> wait
[15:04:46] <DragonPunch> i dont have that, okya i know what to do now. i do it for... the other stuff
[15:04:48] <DragonPunch> thanks qtpie.
[15:04:52] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:06:51] <MrSavage> sacho_: for that $.when.apply(), how could I add a 2D array so one element is the $.get response and the other element is a passed argument?
[15:35:21] <MrSavage> how do i pass a variable/argument with a .then on a $.get?
[15:35:26] <MrSavage> or even without a .then
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:37:51] <MrSavage> here: https://jsfiddle.net/shkkt6d9/1/
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to pass another variable to the .then()?'
[15:38:28] <MrSavage> i suppose so
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you can't really.
[15:38:44] <robertmaxrees> at least, not without some gross hacks.
[15:38:52] <MrSavage> which is what i did lol
[15:39:16] <MrSavage> so how can i accomplish this?
[15:39:43] <MrSavage> I want to append an node to the right node
[15:40:56] <MrSavage> it's $elem i'm trying to append to, but it's giving undefined in the $.get callback for the last .then
[15:41:57] <robertmaxrees> just do it as apart of that previous .then() call.
[15:42:33] <MrSavage> alright
[15:42:49] <MrSavage> but i assume use $.get in the same fashion again?
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah pretty much.
[15:46:18] <Imaginativeone> How do I remove tabs in 11.4.2?
[15:46:33] <Woet> 11.4.2 what?
[15:46:59] <Imaginativeone> jQuery UI 1.11.2
[15:47:07] <Woet> that's.. completely different
[15:47:13] <Imaginativeone> Oops...
[15:47:13] <Woet> what tabs?
[15:48:10] <Imaginativeone> I made some tabs.  I can add new tabs with an addTab function
[15:48:29] <Imaginativeone> By appending an li to the tab group
[15:48:35] <Woet> okay, so using the  jQuery UI 1.11.2 tabs widget, how do you dynamically remove tabs
[15:48:41] <Imaginativeone> Yes
[15:48:51] <Woet> did you read the "Simple manipulation" section of the demos/docs?
[15:49:00] <Imaginativeone> Yes
[15:49:07] <Woet> it covers removing tabs.
[15:49:23] <Imaginativeone> But I am trying to do it with a button
[15:49:44] <Woet> so bind it to the button
[15:49:49] <Imaginativeone> Without a button
[15:50:08] <Woet> so... do it whenever you want to do it
[15:50:12] <Woet> the code remains the same.
[15:50:16] <Imaginativeone> Instead on a data conditional
[15:50:51] <Imaginativeone> Without the button, what do I bind to ?
[15:51:06] <Woet> i don't know, when do you want to remove the tab?
[15:51:08] <Imaginativeone> The data object?
[15:51:48] <Imaginativeone> When my xml nodeName=tabLabel
[15:51:56] <Woet> so put the code there.
[15:52:27] <Imaginativeone> Would you provide an example of how to do that?
[15:52:49] <Woet> it's simple programming
[15:52:57] <Woet> move the code that removes a tab to the point where you want to remove the tab.
[15:53:30] <Imaginativeone> There's no removing the tab
[15:53:47] <Imaginativeone> Remove doesn't work
[15:54:11] <Woet> put your code on www.jsfiddle.net
[15:54:30] <Woet> and create a reproducible demo of it not working.
[15:54:53] <Imaginativeone> There's nothing to put.  I don't know the function.
[15:55:11] <Woet> you're very confusing
[15:55:26] <Woet> what is the problem?
[15:56:06] <Imaginativeone> there is no way to remove tabs without a bound control in 1.11.2
[15:56:18] <Woet> err, yea there is
[15:56:55] <Imaginativeone> please provide an example of how
[15:57:40] <Woet> why would something only be possibly when it's bound to something
[15:57:50] <Woet> simply remove the code that binds it and it works just fine
[15:58:16] <Imaginativeone> Nope, doesn't work without it
[15:58:24] <Woet> [08:54:12]  <Woet>	put your code on www.jsfiddle.net
[15:58:24] <Woet> [08:54:31]  <Woet>	and create a reproducible demo of it not working.
[15:59:12] <Imaginativeone> Dude, could you please just write it up?
[15:59:20] <Woet> you said it doesn't work without it
[15:59:20] <Imaginativeone> Charge money
[15:59:25] <Woet> which means you have written code that doesn't work
[15:59:27] <Woet> so share that code.
[15:59:35] <Woet> pretty straightforward
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:24:12] <MrSavage> is there a way to do ajax with a while loop or recursion and then do something once it's done with the loop or recursion?
[16:24:28] <MrSavage> i can't figure out how to do a call back after it's all done
[16:25:24] <MrSavage> mainly because of the array of $.gets within the looping $.get
[16:25:51] <MrSavage> basically trying to do a callback once all those $.gets are done so i can signal the user that it's done
[16:26:27] <MrSavage> actually i think i got a different solution
[16:26:57] <forQuery> so i'm trying to add data outside of forEach loop not inside of forEach loop.   But, when I do, i get this error image.  http://i.imgur.com/4wyUqZd.png  the list of <li> becomes a list of objects.
[16:27:09] <forQuery> i made a much simplied version of the code here
[16:27:09] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10072665
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> newLi isn't a string, so //myhtml +=  newLi; won't work.
[16:28:34] <forQuery> oh, very interesting.  well that's it then.
[16:29:23] <forQuery> .prop('outerHTML'); is this way to turn it into string?
[16:29:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:29:30] <robertmaxrees> don't do that at all.
[16:29:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> try var myhtml = $(); instead of ''
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> then myhtml.append(newLi);
[16:30:10] <forQuery> :)
[16:30:13] <robertmaxrees> then $searchLabels_allLabels_UL.append(myhtml)
[16:39:33] <forQuery> i tried those changes but... now with them, the drop down is empty - http://pastie.org/10072680
[16:39:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log(myhtml) before the append on the allLabels bit.
[16:39:59] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:42:36] <forQuery> empty [ ]
[16:42:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're mixing yourself up here.  one sec.
[16:43:34] <forQuery> :) thx too much
[16:45:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sbwqgftr/1/ something like this.
[16:46:06] <forQuery> priceless example, thank you robert.  I think i can get it with this.
[16:46:20] <robertmaxrees> this is what we mean by self-contained examples btw.
[16:46:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of all the exta stuff you've got.
[16:47:56] <forQuery> :) yes, i will catch on soon.
[16:58:37] <frank_o> Hi! If I have more than 3 thumbnails I want to show the arrows and initiate some sort of scroller: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/LLux3xdy/1/ -- is this possible with pure jQuery or would I need something like iScroll?
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> "scroller"?
[17:02:08] <robertmaxrees> like a carousel?
[17:03:10] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: yeah i guess
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> you can test of $('.thumbnails').length > 3
[17:03:28] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: any suggestions?
[17:03:39] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: hehe just did :P http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/LLux3xdy/2/
[17:03:44] <forQuery> maybe with something like this http://jsfiddle.net/LLux3xdy/3/ but im not as good
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> but i often tell people to not do that.
[17:04:24] <frank_o> hmmm
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[17:04:55] <frank_o> yup
[17:05:04] <robertmaxrees> that tells you why you shouldn't.
[17:10:46] <forQuery> hehe
[17:12:20] <frank_o> thanks guys :-)
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:18:49] <cranderson> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ reminds me of http://www.comicsanscriminal.com/
[17:23:45] <frabblerock> anyone in here have experience with cavas
[17:23:51] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ frabblerock
[17:23:51] <b-ot> frabblerock: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:24:03] <frabblerock> i did
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, ask it.
[17:24:22] <frabblerock> http://104.236.73.82/aci/
[17:25:08] <robertmaxrees> we normally ask that you make a self-contained example in a jsfiddle or bin
[17:25:14] <frabblerock> anyway to get this to keep 100% height of the window, maintain aspect ratio, apply negative margin to keep canvas centered in the screen
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> so we can edit your code and show you.
[17:25:51] <forQuery> in chrome dev tools, is there a way to open a file like widgetList.js and edit that file, and have it update in real time on the screen?
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> forQuery https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/authoring-development-workflow
[17:26:52] <BillCriswell> forQuery: You can map a file to a localFile and manage that.
[17:26:53] <forQuery> i thought profiles tab but it wont let me edit
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> specicially https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/authoring-development-workflow#live-editing
[17:27:34] <forQuery> i will read this link thank you
[17:27:42] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees
[17:27:52] <frabblerock> am i asking for soemthing really complicated
[17:28:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm only asking you to put in the kind of effort i'd ask anybody else :)
[17:31:18] <frabblerock> i can't really load 540 images in jsfiddle
[17:31:36] <robertmaxrees> small, self-contained :)
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a article on the subject.
[17:38:46] <forQuery> http://104.236.73.82/aci/ doesnt load
[17:40:34] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees
[17:40:41] <frabblerock> you left
[17:40:43] <frabblerock> what
[17:40:44] <frabblerock> the
[17:40:45] <frabblerock> fuck
[17:54:58] <frank_o> frabblerock: he probably got tired of pasting that URL :D
[17:55:33] <frabblerock> forQuery
[17:55:34] <frank_o> we've been fighting for so long to get it in the topic but nobody will listen
[17:55:35] <frabblerock> scroll
[17:55:39] <frabblerock> silly tits
[17:56:44] <frank_o> frabblerock: you dont have to load 500 images, you can just as easily repeat a single instance of http://placehold.it/200x200 500 times in a reduced test case
[17:56:54] <frabblerock> hey silly tits
[17:57:20] <frank_o> frabblerock: you talking shit about my man boobies?
[17:57:25] <frabblerock> https://jsfiddle.net/e0b2ty1e/
[17:57:33] <frabblerock> nv
[17:57:36] <frabblerock> wrong
[17:58:43] <frabblerock> I don't think what i want to achieve is even doable
[17:58:51] <frabblerock> http://104.236.73.82/aci/
[17:58:54] <frabblerock> if you look there
[17:59:02] <frabblerock> and initiate scroll
[17:59:10] <frabblerock> i want to be able to resize the window
[17:59:20] <frabblerock> keep the aspect ratio
[17:59:31] <frabblerock> but also keep the canvas 100% height of the window
[17:59:36] <frabblerock> sort of like how background-size: cover works
[18:00:00] <forQuery> why dont you put it on codepen or something
[18:00:31] <frabblerock> what diff does that make
[18:00:43] <frabblerock> can i replicate background-size cover in canvas is the question
[18:00:55] <forQuery> one is easier to look at and try for solution
[18:00:57] <frank_o> frabblerock: it gives us a better overview of your problem
[18:00:58] <forQuery> one is not
[18:01:07] <frank_o> yeah, what he said
[18:01:48] <intropy> is edittable compatible with mobile browsers?
[18:01:57] <intropy> or should mankind avoid using editable
[18:03:08] <frank_o> intropy: thats hot man thanks for showing
[18:03:21] <frabblerock> http://jsfiddle.net/a0tnrjdy/
[18:03:23] <frabblerock> here
[18:03:37] <frabblerock> what i want to achieve is background-size: cover with canvas
[18:03:52] <frabblerock> 100% width and 100% height with maintaining aspect ratio
[18:04:30] <frank_o> intropy: http://baig.github.io/jquerymobile-editablelistview/ ?
[18:05:13] <frabblerock> forQuery posted
[18:06:43] <frank_o> intropy: my bad not even close
[18:07:42] <frank_o> intropy: anyway to be safe i always just redirect to a new page with a normal form on mobile. something about popups on mobile that just doesn't feel right
[18:08:08] <frabblerock> hello
[18:10:27] <forQuery> cool, so you got it working
[18:10:47] <frank_o> the smaller the screen size the less UI trickery the user should have to deal with, you feel me intropy i represent mankind
[18:10:49] <intropy> what's best way to make text editable?
[18:11:50] <frabblerock> hahaha
[18:11:55] <frabblerock> forQuery
[18:11:56] <se_busca_ayuda> is there a list of common jQuery attributes? such as "autoFocus" "source" and "close"
[18:12:02] <frabblerock> how did i get it working?
[18:12:19] <frabblerock> does that look like 100% of width and 100% of height
[18:14:54] <frabblerock> while constraining aspect ratio
[18:15:11] <drej> you want some responsive thing that retains aspect ratio?
[18:15:32] <drej> http://www.goldenapplewebdesign.com/responsive-aspect-ratios-with-pure-css/
[18:19:45] <frabblerock> i swear there are smarter people in here
[18:20:14] <drej> compared to?
[18:20:20] <frabblerock> drej do you know what background-size: cover does
[18:20:26] <drej> yup
[18:20:32] <intropy> we're tweakers not developers
[18:20:39] <drej> i didnt read up
[18:20:41] <drej> until just now
[18:20:45] <frabblerock> it keeps the full size of the screen while maintaining aspect ratio
[18:20:58] <drej> that's why i said "yup" when you asked if i knew what it was
[18:20:59] <drej> :)
[18:21:16] <drej> i just didnt scroll up to read what you were talking about
[18:21:26] <frank_o> frabblerock: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/a0tnrjdy/3/ ?
[18:21:51] <frabblerock> frank_o thanks
[18:22:01] <frabblerock> but that does not have 100% of its container
[18:23:08] <frabblerock> what im asking is complicated behavior for canvas
[18:23:19] <frabblerock> which is why i asked if anyone has used canvas
[18:23:32] <frabblerock> http://www.sony.com/be-moved/
[18:23:36] <frabblerock> if you go there
[18:23:43] <frabblerock> and make the height really small
[18:23:52] <frabblerock> it maintains aspect ratio
[18:23:58] <frabblerock> var ImageToCanvas = function() {

[18:24:23] <frabblerock> http://pastie.org/10072837
[18:24:31] <frabblerock> idk how to make that work with my code
[18:24:56] <forQuery> yeah, and there are pleanty of other examples like https://github.com/bmcmahen/canvas-image-cover/blob/master/index.js
[18:25:29] <forQuery> you should paste your code into jsfiddle or codepen, someone might help.
[18:29:43] <frabblerock> i did jsfiddle
[18:29:56] <frabblerock> forQuery
[18:30:08] <frabblerock> that code only works within a container that has a fixed width and height
[18:30:20] <frabblerock> canvas-image-cover

[19:11:06] <ajf-> I'm having trouble replicating this exact request with jQuery.ajax:  curl 'https://url.com' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"key":"val"}'
[19:11:17] <ajf-> any help ? I can't get the request not to be text/html type
[19:12:12] <ajf-> I'm using $.ajax({ method: 'POST', contentType: 'application/json', accept:'application/json', url: 'https://url.com', processData: false, data: {"key":"val"} });
[19:21:22] <rainabba> Trying to update a plugin I made so that I can call it on a selector that returs multiple elements so the plugin has access to all those elements and right now it seems to be getting called independantly for each element in the selector. This just a pattern issue, or an inherent limitation of jQuery plugins? If just a pattern, could someone point me to a good example? Here's my present code:
[19:21:22] <rainabba> https://github.com/rainabba/jquery-table2excel/blob/master/src/jquery.table2excel.js
[19:22:13] <rainabba> In the Plugin function (line 11 specifically), element always represents just one element, if if the plugin is called on a selector with more than one element.

[21:05:16] <RubyRonin> how do I access a json element in an array with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/8uac7/2175/
[21:05:42] <RubyRonin> errr...

[21:07:04] <liambrown> Access a json element?
[21:07:23] <liambrown> Ok, I'm looking at the fiddle now.
[21:08:41] <RubyRonin> liambrown: The undefined element json.terms.artist.name is located in the array. see https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6e2963b450c3f7ee5d34
[21:09:05] <liambrown> Ok, let me take a peek at that too.
[21:09:41] <liambrown> It looks like you've got an object inside an array.
[21:09:50] <liambrown> Hang on, let me double check that.
[21:12:24] <liambrown> RubyRonin: yep, you've got the JSON path slightly misaligned. In the case of the data in your gist, you need to use json.terms.artist[0].name instead.
[21:13:13] <liambrown> Do you have control of that structure, or do you have to work with what you get from the server?
[21:13:20] <RubyRonin> liambrown: thanks!
[21:14:04] <RubyRonin> liambrown: I have to check how the plugin is creating the structure. It is a custom post type. Why do you ask?
[21:15:04] <liambrown> RubyRonin: If you can change the structure server-side, then you won't need that pesky array subscript. But maybe there are cases where you have multiple artist objects inside that array; in that case disregard.
[21:15:57] <RubyRonin> liambrown: thanks a million. all of your advice has been helpful
[21:30:38] <liambrown> RubyRonin: NP, good luck.
[21:31:57] <RubyRonin> liambrown: do you have any experience with jquery mobile. and if so, any idea how I can embed an html audio tag in an element that persist even on page change
[21:33:49] <liambrown> RubyRonin: I'm afraid that's beyond my experience, sorry.
[21:34:00] <RubyRonin> liambrown: thanks anyway
[21:38:53] <sadtaco> So lets see, how do I phrase this question.
[21:39:04] <sadtaco> nvm
[21:47:52] <sadtaco> Okay so I need to match elements of a class.  But I only want to match the like least-deep matches.  What's the easiest way to do that?
[21:47:59] <sadtaco> Sort of like the opposite of closest and getting siblings.
[21:49:23] <micqo> hello, guys, I am new to jquery and I got a question that drives me nuts - what's the difference between $('p').click(function() {}); and $('p').click(function(event) {});?
[21:52:14] <micqo> cause I see both ways on learn.jquery.com and it's very confusing
[21:55:38] <Felishia> where's the jquery offset sourcecode?
[22:16:23] <_entropy> hi
[22:49:42] <RubyRonin> _entropy: hi
[23:13:52] <TeddyMurray> is it possible to make a background image in a jquery mobile app? seems the tag added to <html> is making it impossible to create a background image
[23:14:06] <TeddyMurray> attribute added to <html>
[23:14:23] <TeddyMurray> class="ui-mobile"
[23:22:18] <RubyRonin> what do you mean by make?
[23:22:53] <RubyRonin> why wouldn't you just add body-background-image: to the element you want to change?
[23:24:05] <user_corrupt> I want to build a page on my site that will show a grid of images (2 X 4) that will be links to other pages on my site… I want it to be a slideshow where users can click right to see more images (8 at a time).. I also want images to be displayed based on a list that is dynamically generated to show pages in a specific order… does anyone have a good suggestion on where to start for the front end part?
[23:38:29] <TeddyMurray> i am adding it to the body but it doesnt show up because i think somewhere programmatically jquery mobile
[23:38:45] <TeddyMurray> is setting the body attributes
[23:39:09] <TeddyMurray> if i remove the ui-mobile class from html it shows up in chrome inspector
[23:54:01] <Patrick_> is there anyway to disable current date if the current time is after 4pm?
