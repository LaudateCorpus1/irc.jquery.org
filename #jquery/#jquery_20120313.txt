[00:03:59] <aqeel> does this handle contents loaded into div from external files
[00:04:09] <aqeel> my side screen got stuck have to relogin
[00:04:17] <aqeel> any replies...
[00:04:56] <Nomikos> it fills up and says "Hello, World!"
[00:05:02] <Nomikos> Is that a good sign?
[00:05:48] <mindis|wurk> interesting animation
[00:05:50] <aqeel> but that is just inline html,...i was asking about load()....jquery function?
[00:06:27] <Nomikos> load() will happily load content from external files, yeah. It helps a lot if they're on the same server, too
[00:07:15] <Nomikos> and you can trigger the load when the animation finishes.. or .. whenever. They're not related as such
[00:10:33] <aqeel> no...i was asking as the progrss bar prgresses it tracks the loaded content and when load() is finished it goes completed?
[00:11:57] <Nomikos> So the question is "Can I have the progressbar show how far the load() is coming along" ?
[00:12:06] <aqeel> mindis|wurk......this is image less progrss bar
[00:12:15] <aqeel> yes
[00:13:38] <mindis|wurk> aqeel yes i could see that from the code
[00:14:22] <Nomikos> hmm. I can't find anything like that, don't know
[00:15:26] <Nomikos> maybe this has ideas http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8978354/jquery-track-load-request-progress

[00:33:04] <mindis|wurk> you're doing it wrong
[00:39:43] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/8/ how do i make the draggable being showed again? Here it works, but here I'm not using hide: http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/9/ here i know, the draggable isn't shown because i've set it's parent to hidden, so i can "fix" that on the draggable. But I, don't know, what hide() does.
[00:42:09] <mindis|wurk> hide() sets display: none
[00:43:08] <Xotix> mindis|wurk:  hmm, seems not to work by just setting display: block;
[00:44:17] <mindis|wurk> usually hide() would be countered with show()
[00:45:09] <Xotix> mindis|wurk:  applying show to my draggable also doesn't work. or I'm doing something wrong :)
[00:48:00] <mindis|wurk> you should probably look at your document and how it changes. you can easily see any css changes in the style attribute
[00:48:41] <mindis|wurk> firebug is useful for that
[00:53:47] <Xotix> mindis|wurk: I know. Still i don't get it. Hide does display: none if i see it correct. So I don't know, why the child still would be invisible.
[00:54:04] <citizenkeys> why doesn't this work--> $('.ulChanGuide').delegate("li", "click", function() { alert($(this).first("a").attr("href").replace("/","")); });
[00:54:33] <citizenkeys> i want to get the first <a href> from an <li> in class .ulChanGuide and do a pop-up alert that displays it.
[00:54:53] <Zogot> citizenkeys: you should change to .live
[00:54:58] <Zogot> sorry
[00:54:59] <Zogot> .on
[00:56:58] <citizenkeys> we're using 1.6 jquery.  so we don't have .on()
[00:57:30] <Zogot> Make a demo then citizenkeys.
[00:57:33] <Zogot> ?demo @ citizenkeys
[00:57:33] <bot-t> citizenkeys, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:58:20] <citizenkeys> click on the "channels" button then click on a channel.  that should bring up the alert().  http://avsquid.com/beck
[00:59:24] <Kagetsuki1> hello
[01:00:56] <Kagetsuki1> I have a question and it's actually not really jQuery related - but there's just nowhere else to ask. jQuery is fantastic and works great - but Kendo UI I'm having issues with grids. Basically I'd like to know if Kendo UI can handle widgets in Grids in any way (jQuery widgets included).
[01:02:54] <Kagetsuki1> Actually screw it - I'm switching to jqGrid
[01:03:07] <Kagetsuki1> KendoUI has been an awful experience :(
[01:06:31] <Xotix> Kagetsuki1:  for tables you should take a look at datatables.net
[01:07:14] <Kagetsuki1> Xotix: ooh, that looks nice!
[01:07:22] <Kagetsuki1> thanks for the heads up
[01:08:02] <citizenkeys> http://avsquid.com/beck       click on the "channels" button then click on a channel.  that should bring up the alert().
[01:08:35] <fRAiLtY-> If this line, jQuery('#matrixContainer').load('/matrixrefresh/', { stock: stock }); sends the variable stock, how do I also send the variable product with it
[01:15:24] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. What do I have to do to covert the string "0x003388" to a number to be used for the backgroundColor attribute on a div?
[01:16:09] <mindis|wurk> sounds like you could just remove the first two characters
[01:16:23] <mindis|wurk> or rather replace them with #
[01:17:53] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys http://pastie.org/3583797 I'm trying to send the php variable $_product to jQuery as well as the variable stock but product is always blank? Even though if I echo it on the page it's not blank??
[01:19:18] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh.. sending TO jquery?
[01:19:30] <Whirl3d> mindis|wurk, thanks for the reply. That worked, though I swear I tried that first..
[01:19:31] <Cork> do you mean from jquery to php ?
[01:21:41] * tw2113 perks up
[01:24:29] <Whirl3d> I have a background div that contains a transparent greyscale image element and has a background-color value assigned. On top of it, I have a simple fading slideshow of images. The thing is that each image has an "accent" color that I want the bg to change to when the image becomes "active"
[01:24:58] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Like what you did with stock, I need to do the same with product which is a php variable ?
[01:25:04] <Whirl3d> which is a piece of cake, other than I wan the background color/img transition to be much slower than the foreground
[01:25:11] <fRAiLtY-> But outside of the onchange function because that's the same irrespective of the change
[01:25:37] <fRAiLtY-> But yes Cork I probably mean to PHP from jQuery
[01:25:47] <fRAiLtY-> It's early :)
[01:26:15] <Whirl3d> so, for a short while, the new foreground image would be visible and active, but the background would still be slowly fading into it's new color/effect.  Any suggestions on how to manage this smoothly?
[01:26:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: is $_product set when you render the original page?
[01:27:07] <fRAiLtY-> $_product is set in the file jQuery is running in
[01:27:12] <fRAiLtY-> above it, at the top
[01:27:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ya, but i meant was is it dependent on what js does?
[01:27:59] <Cork> or is it something static set when the page load
[01:28:06] <fRAiLtY-> It's something static I'm pretty sure
[01:28:12] <fRAiLtY-> It's just the info about the master product
[01:28:31] <fRAiLtY-> Which remains the same irrespective of the response from jQuery
[01:28:32] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you have a link?
[01:29:34] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: var product = '';
[01:29:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the $_product variable isn't set when you echo it
[01:29:58] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[01:30:03] <fRAiLtY-> Oh
[01:30:09] <Cork> ya, i had it in my history :)
[01:30:20] <fRAiLtY-> So, how do I "echo" it into jQuery then
[01:30:24] <fRAiLtY-> or whatever I mean
[01:30:27] <fRAiLtY-> y'know :D
[01:30:35] <fRAiLtY-> var product = $_product somehow
[01:30:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: looks like its not set in flyer-printing
[01:31:27] <Cork> the way you do it would work if the php script had it
[01:31:46] <tw2113> var product = <?php echo $_product; ?>
[01:31:51] <Cork> ya
[01:31:58] <Cork> with the extra ''
[01:32:14] <Cork> var product = '<?php echo $_product; ?>';
[01:32:16] * tw2113 has done PHP to js, the other way around isn't possible
[01:32:27] * Cork nods
[01:32:41] <Flo710> hi
[01:32:55] <tw2113> i had fun plotting markers on google mapks using coordinates from custom fields in WP
[01:33:00] <fRAiLtY-> So, you're saying the script doesn't have it Cork ?
[01:33:02] <tw2113> maps*
[01:33:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes
[01:33:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: might be a different variable name?
[01:33:48] <Flo710> i need some help with a complex JS-Animation, sb?
[01:34:51] <Flo710> i want to animate multiple elements with different durations
[01:35:32] <Flo710> and the part i really don't know how to solve is, that i want to have a timeline (like in a video) that shows how far the complete animation is processed
[01:35:41] <Flo710> like a progressbar
[01:36:15] <Flo710> sb can help me bout this?
[01:38:06] <Flo710> can sb help me with timed and queued animations in jquery?
[01:39:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: var_dump($_product) = http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[01:39:48] <fRAiLtY-> Show's it is set
[01:40:17] <fRAiLtY-> Perhaps I should just send the ID and let PHP retrieve the rest in the script ?
[01:40:38] <JackBauer24> Flo710: just set some timer and calculate progress basing on elapsed time and animations' total time
[01:50:09] <Flo710> JackBauer24: i thought of that already to set timers and stuff, but there are nearly 100 single animations combined to a video-like animation
[01:50:19] <mindis|wurk> holy crap how difficult it is to get rid of context menus in chrome
[01:51:07] <mindis|wurk> in firefox it's just preventDefault() and you're done. in chrome, nothing seems to work perfectly
[01:51:15] <Flo710> JackBauer24: so i would need to summarize all durations of all single animations and set the timelineanimation to this value
[01:51:38] <Flo710> JackBauer24: But i hope there is a more simple solution....?!
[01:51:53] <D4> $('.class').click( function() { $(this).attr('placeholder', '') }); <-- would this be ok to remove the placeholder text? Basically what I want is to remove the placholder text when the input is active, if nothing is set and you change input the placeholder text should reappear - suggestions?
[01:52:30] <D4> var placeText = $('input.class').attr('placeholder'); and then something to set empty or reset to placeText somehow?
[01:52:52] <Flo710> D4: in HTML5 there is the attribute 'placeholder'
[01:53:01] <D4> It is what I am using atm, yes
[01:53:13] <JackBauer24> Flo710: You can loop through all animated elements, read anim durations and summarize them. I think there isn't a simpler solution.
[01:53:56] <D4> Flo710 » But I guess, for IE and HTML <5 I need to set the value="" and set empty on click etc?
[01:54:36] <Flo710> JackBauer24: hm...I'm working with Adobe Edge or GX, there MUST be a simpler solution...otherwise I'm going mad...
[01:55:12] <Flo710> JackBauer24: i have to create ~150 animations containing ~100 single animations each...
[01:56:41] <Flo710> D4: gimme a sec, i wrote a function for this
[01:57:08] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/r4Fgp/ <-- How do I 'repopulate' the input with the placeholder text if nothing is written?
[01:57:30] <D4> I don't need a function for it, I simply just need a simple code like that which actually works ;p
[01:58:21] <JackBauer24> Flo710: There is no "displayProgressBarForAllMyAnimations()" function in jQuery :) Looping through all animations is as simple as it can get
[01:58:41] <Flo710> JackBauer24: such a function would be nice :)
[01:58:48] <JackBauer24> maybe Adobe Edge offers something to generate such a code, but I've never used it
[01:59:01] <Flo710> D4: just set a attribute in the element which contains your placeholder text
[01:59:22] <Flo710> D4: give the element a class like 'placeholder'
[01:59:24] <mindis|wurk> Cork please tell me you know how prevent contextmenu for contenteditable objects in chrome
[01:59:31] <mindis|wurk> *how to
[01:59:51] <Flo710> D4: and set the value of the input field to the attribute's value if it's empty
[01:59:52] <SoulRaven> anyone has any problem with jquery UI dialog, because sometimes when i do dialog('close') is not closing, just remains on screen, and the overlay disepears
[02:00:11] <Cork> mindis|wurk: $().on('contextmenu', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); should work
[02:00:21] <D4> "a attribute"?
[02:00:46] <Flo710> D4: <inpput type="text" placeholder="Placeholdertext">
[02:01:20] <mindis|wurk> Cork nope :(
[02:01:38] <Flo710> JackBauer24: how can i loop over animated elements? do i need to use a class or can i detect an animation?
[02:01:46] <mindis|wurk> i've managed to get rid of it everywhere on the document except the contenteditable object
[02:02:38] <D4> Flo710 » http://jsfiddle.net/r4Fgp/1/ <-- so, what do I need to do to refill the placeholder text if no data is typed?
[02:03:56] <Flo710> D4: can u see my edited code?
[02:03:59] <JackBauer24> Flo710: http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[02:04:01] <Flo710> on jsfiddle?
[02:05:36] <D4> Flo710 » If you update and give me the link
[02:05:54] <Flo710> D4: ah alright :) http://jsfiddle.net/r4Fgp/2/
[02:06:12] <D4> Yes!
[02:06:17] <D4> Thank you, that is what I was looking for
[02:06:17] <Cork> mindis|wurk: http://jsfiddle.net/ss6rx/1/
[02:06:21] <Flo710> so the input field should look like <input type="text" class="autovalue" name="Placeholder">
[02:06:51] <Cork> mindis|wurk: hmm stopPropagation isn't needed
[02:07:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ss6rx/2/
[02:08:03] <Flo710> JackBauer24: thx so far
[02:08:05] <mindis|wurk> Cork the problem for me was really, REALLY weird. on rightclick i position a fixed div to the click location and show it. showing at the exact location causes the context menu to appear. if i adjust the coordinates by even one pixel it no longer happens :D
[02:08:32] <mindis|wurk> i think it was taking the context menu from the parent document
[02:08:49] <mindis|wurk> but uh, yeah. thanks :)
[02:10:43] <LukeNukem> Hello, how can i check if an element has a certain character ?
[02:10:50] <LukeNukem> example www.youtube.com
[02:12:01] <Flo710> LukeNukem: hwat u mean by "has a certain character" ?
[02:12:04] <Flo710> *what
[02:12:15] <VorTechS> morning all ;)
[02:12:38] <Flo710> VorTechS goood morning
[02:12:49] <LukeNukem> Flo710, i want to if the value in a textarea has a youtube link
[02:13:19] <VorTechS> anyone got any clues as to why this puppy:       formatDate: function (format, date, settings) {
[02:13:19] <VorTechS>          return date.format(format);
[02:13:26] <VorTechS> dies with date.format is undefined?
[02:13:34] <Flo710> like in facebook, a link recognition? i think  u need to work with RegExp
[02:13:38] <VorTechS> in jquery ui datepicker
[02:13:51] <LukeNukem> Flo710, okay
[02:13:59] <Flo710> LukeNukem: or build a function which searches for "<a href" and so on
[02:14:08] <Flo710> RegExp isN't easy
[02:14:57] <softmanpetro> how can I change a css attribute like top: when the element is created only ?
[02:15:10] <softmanpetro> $("#selectot").css("top", "10px") in document ready ?
[02:15:18] <softmanpetro> or how to wait for element
[02:15:47] <Flo710> softmanpetro: check if existing, if not set Timeout and check again
[02:16:44] <Flo710> softmanpetro: or do the css-function as a callback function of the creating-function
[02:19:33] <LukeNukem> flebel, cant this be done in anyway simple
[02:20:05] <AdvoWork> If i'm doing: $('#added_products_container').append(tableConstruct);	  whats the quickest way to empty that div before I do that? looking for optimum speed really if there is any difference
[02:22:24] <VorTechS> .empty()
[02:22:34] <similian> hi folks
[02:22:51] <similian> is it possible that if i reload a part of my page
[02:23:04] <aqeel> $('#added_products_container').html("").append(tableConstruct);................will replace anything inside to exmpty space or use empty()
[02:23:07] <Flo710> similian -> ever heard of ajax?
[02:23:13] <similian> my jquery "listeners" dont work on that new dom?

[02:24:16] <similian> quicksilver i mean :)
[02:25:45] <quicksilver> ;)
[02:27:08] <nVee> which function can I use to add content within a form but not override it like html(), i just want to add content within a selector
[02:27:43] <LukeNukem> nVee, .append
[02:27:45] <Cork> nVee: see ?.append and see ?.prepend
[02:27:45] <bot-t> nVee, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[02:27:46] <bot-t> nVee, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[02:28:10] <LukeNukem> Cork, can you answer my question ^_^ > how to find if a certain url exists in a textarea element
[02:28:15] <LukeNukem> without reGex
[02:28:36] <Cork> ?mdc string search
[02:28:37] <bot-t> Cork, search - MDN - Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and this String object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search
[02:28:44] <Cork> only way
[02:29:13] <Cork> LukeNukem: why isn't regex ok?
[02:29:21] <mindis|wurk> because he's scared of it
[02:30:10] <LukeNukem> Cork, looks tough ^_^
[02:30:46] <mindis|wurk> you'll have to learn some regexp eventually, you can't hide from it
[02:30:59] <Cork> LukeNukem if(textarea.value.search(my_url) !== -1)
[02:32:18] <LukeNukem> Corey, i suppose my_url will be the needle
[02:32:34] <Cork> its the url as a string
[02:32:53] <LukeNukem> var my_url = 'www.google.com';
[02:32:54] <LukeNukem> right
[02:33:04] <Cork> ?eval 'http://www.example.com/url/some.php'.search('example.com/url/some.php')
[02:33:07] <bot-t> Cork: 11
[02:33:17] <Cork> ?eval 'http://www.example.com/url/some.php'.search('example.com/url/some_other.php')
[02:33:18] <bot-t> Cork: -1
[02:33:36] <LukeNukem> Cork, what  does -1 mean?
[02:33:50] <Cork> it means not found; read the link i gave you
[02:33:53] <fortysixandtwo> Hi! Anyone know if jquery-svg has a channel on freenode?
[02:33:56] <quicksilver> are you actually incapable of reading the documentation he linked you to?
[02:34:18] <Cork> quicksilver: don't be so harsh
[02:34:28] <quicksilver> it's not even on-topic
[02:34:33] <mindis|wurk> he has a habit of lacking any kind of initiative
[02:34:42] <quicksilver> it's a javascript question on a jquery channel where you gave him a link which precisely answered his question
[02:34:56] <quicksilver> and he asked a further question which was answered quite clearly in the link
[02:34:58] * quicksilver shrugs
[02:36:08] <LukeNukem> var search = $(this).val.search("www.youtube.com/watch?v=");
[02:36:08] <LukeNukem>    if(search = -1){ alert("yep") }
[02:36:56] <sjeijk> morning jquery
[02:37:02] <LukeNukem> ;p
[02:37:17] <fortysixandtwo> I'm trying to load multiple svg's from file and add them to a container. The documentation for jquery-svg is a little bit lacking, so I was hoping someone here had used it before: http://pastebin.com/ESqgs8uV
[02:37:53] <fortysixandtwo> Oh, I forgot to strip out some dummy methods there. One sec and I'll get a cleaner version
[02:52:16] <SoulRaven> anyone has any problem with jquery UI dialog, because sometimes when i do dialog('close') is not closing, just remains on screen, and the overlay disepears
[02:55:35] <Trisox> pff netsplit
[02:59:30] <Cork> SoulRaven: classic
[02:59:47] <Cork> SoulRaven: the dialog is reusing the overlay
[02:59:54] <Cork> and it can sometimes get out of sync
[03:00:18] <Cork> so when you close a dialog (but have another one below) it removes the overlay even though it should still be shown
[03:01:30] <Cork> SoulRaven: so your prob having two dialogs and closes the first one
[03:03:49] <SoulRaven> sems that if i open multiple dialogs, the content inside of that dialogs are appended to the dialog div, i manage to remove this, using close: function(ev, ui) { $(this).dialog( "destroy" ); },
[03:03:55] <SoulRaven> but i am not shure if is ok
[03:04:48] <Cork> SoulRaven: ya, close doesn't remove the old dialog
[03:04:56] <Cork> it just hides it
[03:05:13] <SoulRaven> so, if i try like this is ok: close: function(ev, ui) { $(this).dialog( "destroy" ); },
[03:05:25] <SoulRaven> to destroy the element
[03:05:45] <Cork> that should still leave the content though
[03:06:08] <Cork> destroy only removes the wrappers, classes and js
[03:06:21] <SoulRaven> so $(this).html();
[03:06:22] <SoulRaven> is ok?
[03:06:33] <SoulRaven> to remove the contend inside the dialog div?
[03:06:46] <SoulRaven> ^content
[03:06:47] <Cork> both would work ya :)
[03:06:58] <Cork> or even better
[03:07:02] <Cork> .remove()
[03:07:12] <SoulRaven>  function(ev, ui) { $(this).dialog( "destroy" ).remove(); },
[03:07:14] <Cork> else you would still have the container
[03:07:21] * Cork nods
[03:07:46] <SoulRaven> i want the container for future use of the dialog, but i diferent content
[03:08:02] <Cork> ah, then html('') is what you want
[03:08:54] <SoulRaven> i have added the html('')
[03:09:10] <SoulRaven> now will see in the future how it behaves:)
[03:12:34] <recentlydeceased> hey folks, wrestling with jquery for a project.  I'm using slideToggle to show/hide and element... It's working, but tow issues... it looks like it has only two speeds (slow=1200, fast=600), is that right? Slow is too fast! ;)  Next, when the element (div) slides down, it goes a little too far and then shifts back up to the correct position, it looks a bit weird, any ideas?
[03:13:10] <Cork> 1) so set your speed with numbers
[03:13:36] <Cork> 2) i think was padding; don't remember though
[03:13:57] <Cork> fiddle with the css or adding a none styled wrapper should fix that
[03:14:55] <recentlydeceased> Cork, yeah, I went for a huge number like 26000 and it made no difference
[03:15:12] <recentlydeceased> Cork, I'll check my css, thank you!
[03:16:14] <recentlydeceased> is there an upper limit to the values you can set in animations?
[03:17:06] <Cork> recentlydeceased: http://fiddle.jshell.net/4mJqk/
[03:18:36] <recentlydeceased> Cork, hmmmm, yeah the huge number appears to work there.
[03:18:51] <Cork> recentlydeceased: its miliseconds
[03:19:12] <Cork> so that animation will take 30 secons from start to end
[03:20:08] <recentlydeceased> Cork, once again, I highlight my idiocy... '26000' is v different to 26000
[03:20:12] <recentlydeceased> doh!
[03:20:17] <recentlydeceased> works
[03:20:26] <Cork> lol
[03:20:29] <Cork> ya it is
[03:20:35] * recentlydeceased thanks Cork v muchly

[03:20:52] <Cork> two??
[03:21:16] <recentlydeceased> well, now to go over my css and see what's what
[03:21:38] <Cork> recentlydeceased: i just remembering hitting the same problem way back
[03:21:40] <recentlydeceased> two bots?  they're multiplying... only a matter of time now till world domination
[03:21:45] <Cork> and i know it was something with the css
[03:21:51] <Cork> don't remeber (it was years ago)
[03:22:05] <recentlydeceased> well, thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
[03:22:08] <Cork> recentlydeceased: heh true :)

[04:36:41] <thapriest> So, i'm kinda new here. But can someone help me with a push in right direction with jQuer?
[04:38:50] <Adamantus> Do you know why my jquery date picker would look like this? http://postimage.org/image/tj9n7ic9z/full/ The js is working fine, css is loaded and paths correct but no styling is used.
[04:41:34] <siovene> Hi. I have a question about JQuery UI's `draggable`. I have a `draggable` inside a container that uses `overflow: auto;`, and despite having set 'scroll: false', moving the `draggable` still keeps it into the container, which will start to scroll. Any suggestions?
[04:42:54] <thapriest> I want to fill the div result with the php file from the action attribute (the action does just echo the $_POST variables), what am i doing wrong here .(just starting with jQuery) http://jsfiddle.net/thapriest/TStnm/
[04:45:46] <thapriest> @ <Adamantus> seems like you CSS is been overridden by something. Sure you're loading the right classes, and there's no conflict?
[04:46:38] <Adamantus> thapriest: If you look in the image you can see main.css. That file is not overriding any other styles further down the list. It only shows main.css
[04:46:56] <Adamantus> So the jquery ui css is loaded and path is right but it's not used.
[04:48:47] <thapriest> Admantus: maybe it's nothing, but why use capital letter S for link rel="stylesheet"
[04:49:28] <Adamantus> thapriest: Copied from jquery website, I'll change it.
[04:50:43] <MagmaRules> Guys i have an object that has jquery bind events in its functions. How do i access other object functions?
[04:51:36] <Adamantus> I did use the "Theme Folder Name:" and "css scope" options when downloading themerolled jquery ui, don't know if that makes a difference, but paths look ok.
[04:53:13] <thapriest> Can you link me to that page? so i can have a look see
[04:58:04] <hurry> hi, i want replace an charatter inside my Key (inside .each() ) i try with this       key.replace("font", "-"); but don't replace
[04:58:22] <hurry> i try convert to string key but nothing
[04:59:27] <SoulRaven> anyone try to put icon on buttons from ui dialog?
[05:00:06] <iLogic> hurry: I don't think there is a replace(), just replaceWith or replaceAll
[05:00:58] <hurry> i try       text = key;  then             text = text.replace("font", "-");  and it's works now
[05:01:03] <hurry> sorry for spaces
[05:01:21] <hurry> text is special "key" ?
[05:01:29] <hurry> im lookin in google
[05:02:17] <Adamantus> thapriest: Fixed it.
[05:02:19] <hurry> iLogic:  it's simple.... key = key.replace("_", "-");
[05:02:33] <Adamantus> It was those crappy folder options on themeroller.
[05:02:33] <hurry> whit this works... :)
[05:02:52] <iLogic> hurry: I see, nice :)
[05:03:05] <hurry> thanks anyway
[05:03:15] <iLogic> np

[05:26:41] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know of a good tutorial on caching AJAX responses?
[05:27:13] <ravenzz> cache: true ?
[05:28:00] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[05:28:01] <ravenzz> which is actually the default value
[05:28:10] <ravenzz> when you do an ajax request
[05:28:36] <ravenzz> cacheBoolean
[05:28:36] <ravenzz> Default: true, false for dataType 'script' and 'jsonp'
[05:28:45] <jeffsmykil> do i use the xhr panel iun firefox to see this?
[05:29:10] <ravenzz> I think so, I don't use firefox so often
[05:29:27] <jeffsmykil> Now for expires I have 12/31/1969 that seems off :-p
[05:29:36] <ravenzz> ahah
[05:29:39] <SoulRaven> anyone try to put UI buttons on dataTables ?
[05:29:47] <ravenzz> well it could depends on your webserver i think
[05:29:50] <SoulRaven> using sDOM attribute
[05:30:13] <smplstk> ?:has
[05:30:13] <caniuse> smplstk: :has() Selector: Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[05:30:17] <jeffsmykil> this is local ravenzz
[05:30:54] <ravenzz> same story. anyway I am not 100% sure, I am just guessing
[05:31:00] <jeffsmykil> k ty
[05:31:00] <ravenzz> it
[05:31:26] <ravenzz> wait for other answers, in the meanwhile you can ask on #web as well
[05:36:27] <jcp_> i'm trying to store results from an ajax call into a variable but it's not working: http://pastebin.com/L6Xmtuqy
[05:37:11] <jcp_> it just returns "undefined" but when i do something like "console.log(data)" it shows the object is returning
[05:38:40] <Adamantus> jcp_: What is jsonp?
[05:38:45] <jeffsmykil> when you use firefox it returns the json?
[05:38:50] <jeffsmykil> in the console?
[05:39:09] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: yes, Adamantus i could have that say "json"
[05:39:29] <jeffsmykil> well is it cross domain?
[05:39:31] <Adamantus> jcp_: Don't you have to try to console.log a specific portion of data usch as data.thing ? I suppose it depends what you're passing back.
[05:39:32] <jeffsmykil> do you need jsonp?
[05:39:36] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: nope, sorry that was a typo
[05:39:59] <jeffsmykil> did you try data.d?
[05:40:16] <jcp_> in success, if i run "console.log(data), it returns the entire json object, which is what i want to store in a variable
[05:40:17] <jeffsmykil> results = data.d
[05:40:39] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense jcp
[05:40:48] <Adamantus> jeffsmykil: Way ahead of ya :p
[05:41:11] <jeffsmykil> I never use "data:"
[05:41:26] <SoulRaven> anyone try to put UI buttons on dataTables ?
[05:41:27] <SoulRaven> using sDOM attribute
[05:41:59] <jeffsmykil> is results global jcp_
[05:42:36] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: yep
[05:42:52] <jeffsmykil> you sure its not out of scope by the time you run console.log
[05:42:56] <jeffsmykil> it doesn't look like it is
[05:43:39] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: what do you mean?
[05:44:03] <jeffsmykil> if it was global wouldnt the definition be outside the document.ready?
[05:45:00] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: hm, yea, i just made it global. still nothing =/
[05:45:29] <jeffsmykil> try the console.log in the success function
[05:46:45] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: yep, that's working, returns an object
[05:47:02] <jeffsmykil> then its a scope problem
[05:49:03] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: hmm, what's interesting is when i run this code http://pastebin.com/WSrPVPFk the "undefined" fires before it prints the console.log(data) within success.
[05:49:30] <jeffsmykil> thats because they aren't chained
[05:49:36] <jeffsmykil> js doesn't happen in order like that
[05:49:42] <jeffsmykil> it doesnt wait for the ajax to be done
[05:49:46] <jeffsmykil> before hitting the console log
[05:51:01] <ansh> hi guys'
[05:51:19] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: hmm, interesting. so you can't really store json in a variable and then call it immediately, right?
[05:51:43] <jeffsmykil> you can if the variable is inside of the success function
[05:51:55] <jeffsmykil> and then pass it as a parameter to another function
[05:52:53] <jeffsmykil> jcp_: this is a concept I had trouble with when I started too, don't feel back
[05:52:55] <jeffsmykil> bad
[05:55:40] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: no worries, just want to clarify. so i'm limited to running my code within success? what if i want to use the data retrieved via the ajax call elsewhere?
[05:56:14] <jeffsmykil> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[05:56:50] <jeffsmykil> jcp_: that was written by erichynds and it's very helpful
[05:56:56] <erichynds> <3
[05:57:18] <jcp_> jeffsmykil: great, thanks! i'll give it a read
[05:57:30] <impulse9> hi, this is probably a noob question but ... i can make a copy of an object with .clone(), how do i make a new object altogether (without cloning an existing one)?
[05:58:18] <ansh> i m facing some problem with .load() event of image
[05:58:27] <jeffsmykil> i think you can use new Object();
[05:58:39] <ansh> i read few stuff from here
[05:58:40] <ansh> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[05:58:44] <impulse9> so every object i create is essentially a DOM object?
[05:59:00] <ansh> how can i get rid of it?
[05:59:27] <jeffsmykil> impulse the whole object javascript thing confuses the hell out of
[05:59:52] <jeffsmykil> impulse9: are you coming from another language?
[05:59:57] <impulse9> yeah
[06:00:00] <impulse9> c++ hardcore stuff mainly
[06:00:01] <impulse9> lol
[06:00:12] <jeffsmykil> forget everything you know about objects :-p
[06:00:14] <impulse9> :D
[06:00:21] <impulse9> ok thanks
[06:00:37] <jeffsmykil> because js objects are f'ed up according to every programmer i talk to
[06:01:49] <jeffsmykil> var ObjectName = {};
[06:01:53] <impulse9> there's one thing i don't get though
[06:01:57] <jeffsmykil> that's how I usually do it impulse9
[06:02:00] <impulse9> how can a DOM object contain stuff like functions
[06:02:05] <impulse9> and css
[06:02:07] <impulse9> at the same time
[06:02:28] <impulse9> = {} is essentially the same as new Object() as far as i know
[06:02:30] <jeffsmykil> thats a question for erichynds or ajpiano or eviltwin someone that knows stuff, unlike me
[06:02:42] <erichynds> you mean a DOM node or a jquery object?
[06:02:53] <impulse9> i'm confused as to what seperates the two
[06:03:22] <erichynds> the DOM isn't javascript - it's its own entity that JS can interact with
[06:03:24] <erichynds> so there's that
[06:03:43] <impulse9> so when you make a new object and put css in it
[06:03:48] <impulse9> where is that
[06:03:51] <erichynds> what do you mean make a new object
[06:03:59] <impulse9> well a dom object
[06:04:03] <impulse9> a <div> element
[06:04:10] <impulse9> so i can put things in it
[06:04:35] <erichynds> it's... in the variable you assign it to, if you choose to assign it to a variable
[06:05:00] <impulse9> i can achieve that with .clone() but i really override all css so i make an entirely different style
[06:05:06] <impulse9> so i figured why clone at all
[06:05:59] <erichynds> i mean, if you make a div element and have css that applies to all divs, that's going to affect your new element
[06:06:38] <impulse9> well even if it applies to all divs you can override it
[06:06:43] <erichynds> right
[06:06:44] <impulse9> but that's not the issue really
[06:06:51] <smplstk> ?eval 2+2
[06:06:53] <bot-t> smplstk: 4
[06:07:01] * smplstk shrugs
[06:07:51] <rroelofs> impulse9: var newDiv = $("<div>") $("body").append(newDiv);  ??
[06:07:55] <jeffsmykil> smplstk: you can append to a hidden element right?
[06:08:43] <rroelofs> sure
[06:08:47] <smplstk> ?tias @ jeffsmykil
[06:08:48] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Try It And See
[06:09:03] <jeffsmykil> well it's not working, and I wanted to rule out that as a reason as to why
[06:09:29] <rroelofs> test your selector

[06:16:39] <erichynds> are there a lot of flights in/out of there?
[06:17:26] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: fair amount
[06:17:38] <jeffsmykil> southwest flies out of there, which is what really matters
[06:17:43] <erichynds> MariusKarthaus: the datepicker widget isn't actually built on the widget factory, so that event may not exist there
[06:17:46] <erichynds> oh true

[06:24:43] <MariusKarthaus> erichynds: any other ideas about how I would get access to the object that it the date widget ? I can get the 'widget', which is a div after I create it, but if I apply .css({zIndex:5}) to it, the popup will still be at z-index 1 which is just not good (some other stuff overlaps)
[06:25:33] <erichynds> MariusKarthaus: does $("#foo").datepicker("widget") work/
[06:25:34] <erichynds> ?
[06:26:16] <MariusKarthaus> erichynds: yes I get the div object, but I cannot manipulate the zindex, it is reset to 1 when the users clicks the input field
[06:26:33] <erichynds> yeahh i dunno

[07:30:04] <SoulRaven> the problems appears when i make another ajax call to populate the div that warps all ajax calls, because when i call again a dialog, a new div is created and appened to the main body, not on the div that warps the ajax content
[07:30:45] <jeffsmykil> pifantastic: this is based off of .95
[07:30:53] <jeffsmykil> they are at .97 now
[07:31:03] <SoulRaven> so, after 3-4 times when i call diferent ajax content, i will have 3-4 div that warp dialogs appeneded to body
[07:31:26] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: you just need to make it so that when a dialog is closed, it also removes itself from the dom
[07:32:17] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: right, but if i want to call the dialog again? without the nead to refresh the content using ajax
[07:32:27] <ajpiano> .dialog({ close: function() { $(this).dialog("destroy").remove(); } });
[07:32:42] <ajpiano> if you are calling it again, aren't you re-requesting the content via ajax?
[07:33:01] <SoulRaven> only the content inside the dialog
[07:33:09] <ajpiano> ... right
[07:33:18] <ajpiano> so you wouldn't need to reuse the dialog
[07:33:35] <SoulRaven> i do, so....
[07:33:56] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: so then what's the problem with it being at the bottom of the DOM invisible
[07:34:17] <SoulRaven> how is it work: i have a menu......when i click the menu, a content is fetched to display what i have selected from the menu
[07:34:44] <SoulRaven> when i dbl click on a row in that table fetched, a ui dialog is called
[07:35:22] <SoulRaven> in the same content is present a dialog div, fetched with the ajax
[07:35:47] <SoulRaven> so each level of the menu has a ajax call, that contains the table and the div dialog
[07:35:48] <Frantic> Suppose I have this login-protected page with some ajax controls on it. My session expires in 5 minutes. What's the best way to handle session expiration and redirect the user back to the login page when an ajax call returns a "session expired" message?
[07:36:18] <Frantic> can I do this one time only? I've thought about $.ajaxComplete, but that gets called after $.ajax({onComplete: function})
[07:36:59] <blackspotwiggins> Frantic, catch the 403 and set window.location
[07:37:02] <SoulRaven> or is bad practice to have multiple div's dialogs located in the ajax call content, for each menu secion
[07:37:19] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: it's impossible for me to tell you right now what the ideal arrangement for your application would be
[07:37:21] <jeffsmykil> pifantastic: so my drops aren't populating or showing
[07:37:33] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: that's exactly what I'm trying to do, but I can't seem to find a way to catch the 403 in one place
[07:37:39] <blackspotwiggins> error?
[07:37:49] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: I don't want to have all my onComplete callbacks do a lot of ifs
[07:37:57] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: what do you mean by "error"?
[07:38:00] <blackspotwiggins> error callback
[07:38:12] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: the point is, you aren't at the mercy of the dialogs, you can do whatever you want with the content during the lifecycle of the app using the dialog events
[07:38:13] <blackspotwiggins> it runs before complete
[07:38:53] <blackspotwiggins> you can check the response code, if it's not 403 just do nothing
[07:39:04] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: you're right, thanks :)
[07:39:31] <blackspotwiggins> just sending people to login all of a sudden might be a bad thing, mind you
[07:40:13] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: why? they cannot do anything else if the session is expired anyway
[07:40:41] <blackspotwiggins> Frantic, they might be typing in another url for example
[07:40:51] <blackspotwiggins> or admiring your awesome backgrounds
[07:40:54] <blackspotwiggins> or somethin
[07:41:21] <Frantic> that's why I don't want to use a setTimeout(sessionDuration, redirectToLogin)
[07:41:35] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: how would you handle this?
[07:41:48] <blackspotwiggins> show a message, explaining whats up and provide a link
[07:41:50] <nights> anyone used PIE?
[07:41:51] <Frantic> I have to tell the user his session is gone, and he has to re-log-in
[07:41:58] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: thanks
[07:42:03] <Frantic> blackspotwiggins: that's true :)

While dragging it, scroll down/up with the mousewheel or go to the top/bottom of the screen, so it scrolls automatically. As you see, it behaves very strange. Why? I guess it's because i drag it out of an position: absolute or because i apply show() to its parent.

[07:59:39] <Xotix> jaffipaffi: just make the a as big as the menubar or give the second ul a padding top, so there is no space.

[08:33:28] <ShadowChancellor> How can I tell what dom element was clicked to cause a focusout event
[08:33:48] <Flo710> Thanatermesis: it's very good, u can use it in nearly all vrowsers
[08:33:52] <Flo710> *browsers
[08:34:49] <Xotix> ShadowChancellor:  use this within the click
[08:35:24] <quicksilver> I suspect the focusout handler gets called before the click handler although I'd have to test to be sure
[08:35:47] <quicksilver> googling suggests I'm right.
[08:36:05] <quicksilver> so you'd have to save some information in a variable during the focusout (because at that point you don't know what has been clicked)
[08:36:20] <quicksilver> and then pick that up in a suitably high level click() handler (probably a document level click handler)
[08:36:33] <Thanatermesis> Flo710, actually im doing a test with "links2 -g", which its logic that doesnt support jquery, so i think that i have made the wrong question, i should better ask "what happens if the browser doesn't support jquery? the contents still available but just without effects?"
[08:36:43] <quicksilver> and further worry about focusouts which are not caused by clicks
[08:36:47] <quicksilver> e.g. by TAB keys.
[08:36:54] <ShadowChancellor> ic
[08:37:01] <ShadowChancellor> thanks guys
[08:37:17] <quicksilver> mousedown gets called before focusout though
[08:37:22] <quicksilver> see the example code here for some ideas : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6896518/jquery-focus-out-event
[08:38:56] <ShadowChancellor> oh that could be useful
[08:39:27] <ShadowChancellor> yeah
[08:39:29] <ShadowChancellor> that's perfect
[08:39:41] <ShadowChancellor> basically I wanted to return false if a certain element caused the focusout
[08:41:13] <Flo710> Thanatermesis: it will give a error message in the console and all JS-Code will not be executed
[08:42:57] <durre_> no ideas? how to catch an ajax error from a jsonp request?
[08:43:55] <Noeble> question: if I save an integer in a .click(), can I save that int until I click on another object and build an array out of my click?
[08:44:10] <Larholm> durre_, http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
[08:45:09] <Xotix> Noeble yes. just add a new property with the int as value to your obj.
[08:46:25] <Noeble> Xotix: hmm but wont the memory reset?
[08:48:25] <Thanatermesis> Flo710, is there some documentation about how to do for make that compatible ? (so, in case that the jquery is not loaded for a image-gallery, load the images also in the classic way)
[08:49:13] <Defusal> hi everyone
[08:49:20] <Defusal> does anyone here have experience with highcharts?
[08:49:26] <Defusal> im really struggling now
[08:50:23] <Hawkee> maybe somebody can help me think this logic through
[08:50:27] <youngin> Defusal: why not graphael?
[08:50:35] <Hawkee> when you start a @mention on facebook it brings up the autosuggest right away
[08:50:44] <Defusal> i updated my highcharts to get rid of some warnings and improve the dynamic animation, but now for some reason when i use addPoint for the first time, it plots from the beginning again, as if theres no data already on the chart, which plots a second line for each series
[08:50:47] <Hawkee> and even when you type a space it continues
[08:51:07] <Hawkee> so every keystroke after the @ queries their server for a term
[08:51:15] <Defusal> youngin, when i researched and compared all the js graphing libraries last year, highcharts was far superior, and has everything i require
[08:51:40] <Hawkee> so suppose I type @beef not wanting to mention somebody and just continue typing
[08:52:15] <Hawkee> at what point would each keystroke after that stop querying the server?
[08:52:21] <Defusal> youngin, from a quick look, graphael is extremely basic and has very little functionality im comparison
[08:52:28] <themachine> jqplot isnt bad
[08:52:31] <Xotix> Noeble http://jsfiddle.net/cD99v/
[08:52:34] <Defusal> since im using it in realtime, updating every few seconds, highcharts is great
[08:52:35] <youngin> cool
[08:52:43] <Defusal> and very interactive
[08:52:53] <Defusal> if only there wasnt this issue since upgrading :(
[08:53:33] <xenaxon> how to make a image fade out to 80% opacity onhover and back to 100% onmouseout
[08:54:01] <Hawkee> anybody catch my question?
[08:54:14] <Xotix> Noeble http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:55:00] <Kyoorius> can somebody explain this piece of code to me - http://pastebin.com/zWhN3GG3
[08:55:30] <xenaxon> is there any way of tinting an image 20% black
[08:55:31] <xenaxon> ?
[08:55:53] <ptriller> xenaxon, overlay it with a 20 % opaque black image/background I guess
[08:55:54] <Kyoorius> xenanon : set its opacity down and put black underneath it?
[08:56:19] <xenaxon> Kyoorius: would that work?
[08:56:25] <xenaxon> the same as the overlay?
[08:56:25] <Kyoorius> umm sure...
[08:56:29] <Kyoorius> ofcourse
[08:56:32] <xenaxon> thanks
[08:56:33] <Kyoorius> same concept
[08:56:34] <xenaxon> both of you
[08:56:47] <brianV> Quick question - does anyone know of a slideshow plugin that has the ability to permalink to slides (ie, given a URL parameter, start at a specific slide)
[08:56:50] <Kyoorius> only you dont need an extra element if you set the image as a background of an element
[08:57:02] <Kyoorius> and use the background color as black of the same element
[08:57:18] <Chopps> hey guys, i clonned a form element with the clone() function, is it possible to modify the clone, for example change field values or button names, etc??
[08:57:57] <xenaxon> Kyoorius: and any way of setting it's opacity down in time? I mean, smooth
[08:58:00] <xenaxon> not instant
[08:58:07] <nail_> or mix both, put a 10% opaque overlay, and change the image opacity to 90%, on a black background
[08:58:25] <Kyoorius> $('#yourelement').fadeTo(1000, 0.2);
[08:58:26] <NoiseEee> Chopps: of course
[08:59:24] <Chopps> NoiseEee can u tell me how please?
[08:59:37] <sweetgrass> hi. I'm using the placeholder plugin (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder) but struggling to make it work as desired on password fields. Anyone know a good work around?
[09:00:39] <sweetgrass> basically, the password field is still masked. I want it to not mask it and have the word 'Password' in it and then on focus, mask the users input
[09:01:08] <NoiseEee> Chopps: var newEl = $('#something').clone().val('newValue')
[09:02:50] <VioByte> Chopps: $("#window_original").clone().attr("id", "window_" + cw).appendTo('#desktop'); /* Clone Window and place inside desktop div*/
[09:02:55] <VioByte> that works fine for me
[09:03:36] <rained23> hello, i have a form inside a form, and i use jquery form to submit my form, how can i remove the sub form from my main form before I submit it.
[09:04:10] <Gozzy> sweetgrass http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/placeholder you mean like they do in the demo?
[09:04:20] <NoiseEee> rained23: thats invalid markup.
[09:04:24] <rained23> I know other solution that to use iFrame for my sub form, but I prefer using jquery for it.
[09:04:26] <ptriller> rained23, subforms are illegal
[09:04:30] <ajpiano> Hawkee: have you actually looked at the xhr traffic while using the fb autocomplete
[09:04:37] <Defusal> if anyone has experience with HighCharts and dynamicly adding points, plese let me know
[09:04:42] <Defusal> please*
[09:04:52] <sweetgrass> Gozzy: :/ yes but in IE.
[09:04:55] <Chopps> NoiseEee but the element im clonning is a form with a lot of fields, will that work?? and VioByte, is #window_original a form element?
[09:05:10] <xenaxon> 	$('.tint_animation').onmouseover(function() {$('.tint_animation').fadeTo(1000, 0.8)}); // fades the appropriate elements to that opacity
[09:05:20] <NoiseEee> Chopps: then iterate/select the fields you need and adjust them as required
[09:05:23] <xenaxon> maybe I'm doing something wrong, but nothing is happening
[09:05:23] <iLogic> sweetgrass: sweet nick
[09:05:25] <xenaxon> to above line
[09:05:31] <sweetgrass> Gozzy: it works fine out of the box ie nice browsers but we're struggling with IE
[09:05:33] <ajpiano> Hawkee: just from examining it, it looks like the people suggestions dont' even come in over ajax, they're probably bootstrapped in earlier. all it's searching for while you type is matching groups and events and other crap to "like"
[09:05:44] <Gozzy> that demo works for me in ie..
[09:05:49] <sweetgrass> iLogic: haha. thanks. Not what you might think though. ;)
[09:06:28] <rained23> Yeah, I know. but I have 5 file upload that inside my form, and I want the file upload to work without reloading the page
[09:06:53] <rained23> as the location of the fields are near other fields.
[09:07:26] <sweetgrass> Gozzy: So it does! I'll look deeper then. Sorry, i hadn't found the demo page before. Thank you
[09:08:08] <rained23> is there a way to submit a fields only ?
[09:09:05] <rained23> cause i want to do ajax for my file fields. so when user upload a file, it will only submit my file fields only.
[09:09:10] <Hawkee> ajpiano, no I didn't want to go so far as to monitor packets at facebook
[09:09:15] <WebDragon> is there a toggle that cycles through a list such that instead of a simple boolean toggle it would cycle through A|B|C instead of A|"" ?
[09:09:16] <Hawkee> but I did come up with a solution that I think will work
[09:09:24] <WebDragon> or should I just write one
[09:09:35] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone spotted a tool that removes commented out sections, or a regex?
[09:09:52] <WebDragon> K3|Chris|Work: minifiers
[09:09:54] <K3|Chris|Work> I got a file with 300~ commented out sections all with a different number inside...
[09:09:56] <Hawkee> while searching if I come up with no results I record the length of the search query and the position of the @
[09:10:02] <Hawkee> then unless the length decreases I won't query again
[09:10:28] <Hawkee> that way it doesn't continue to search even after we've hit zero results
[09:11:33] <Hawkee> ajpiano, so you're saying facebook is prepopulating that information when the page loads?
[09:12:10] <ajpiano> Hawkee: it looks like it
[09:12:16] <xenaxon> can someone tell me why this line of code doesn't work?
[09:12:16] <ajpiano> Hawkee: if you log into fb and do view source
[09:12:19] <xenaxon> 	$(".tint_animation").click(function() {
[09:12:19] <xenaxon> 	  alert("Handler for .click() called.");
[09:12:19] <xenaxon> 	});
[09:12:24] <ajpiano> you'll see your entire friends list is bootstrapped in as json
[09:12:44] <shwaiil> Q: i'm reading about basic plugin structure for jquery and i'm trying to understand "$.fn.myNewPlugin = function() { //...". What's FN ? Tks
[09:12:47] <xenaxon> if I replace .tint_animation with body, and click body... the alert comes up
[09:12:58] <fortysixandtwo> Has anyone tried jquery svg? No mather what I do when I import a svg-file, it set height to "null"
[09:13:00] <ajpiano> shwaiil: $.fn is the jQuery prototype
[09:13:00] <xenaxon> and I've placed the tint_animation class to a img
[09:13:12] <Hawkee> ajpiano, I did a little search of the source and I don't see the names of people that come up
[09:13:13] <xenaxon> and no idea why it's not calling the function
[09:13:15] <Hawkee> so it does use ajax
[09:13:17] <shwaiil> ajpiano: tks for looking. I see :)
[09:13:31] <Joeytje50> hey, I want to make a function test() { } that uses an AJAX call to get data from an url and then return the result
[09:13:35] <ajpiano> $.fn an object with methods and properties that get added on to every new jquery object
[09:13:37] <Joeytje50> is that possible?
[09:13:46] <ajpiano> Hawkee: it uses it for looking up matches for other things
[09:14:52] <ajpiano> oh it looks like all these friends are bootstrapped in for chat, not typeahead
[09:14:57] <Hawkee> either way, there should be a mechanism that prevents the javascript from checking for results once a null result comes up
[09:14:59] <ajpiano> i have no idea really, i just started looking a few mins ago when you asked
[09:15:21] <Joeytje50> I want to make a function test() { } that uses an AJAX call to get data from an url and then returns the result. Is that possible?
[09:15:40] <Hawkee> I think my solution should be sufficient
[09:15:51] <Hawkee> it makes sense
[09:15:51] <Joeytje50> for example test() calls '/api.php?foo=bar' and then returns the result
[09:16:04] <xenaxon> does jquery not call .click function when clicking on an image?
[09:16:08] <Joeytje50> so /api.php?foo=bar returns 'baz'
[09:16:10] <albemuth> Joeytje50 look into deferreds
[09:16:16] <Joeytje50> how can I make test() give baz
[09:16:25] <Joeytje50> albemuth: deferreds?
[09:16:29] <sphinxxx> anyone use cargo?
[09:16:46] <albemuth> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[09:16:58] <plln> what is the simple lightbox for jquery ?
[09:17:02] <ajpiano> Joeytje50: you can't "return" the server's response to the function that triggers the ajax call, because ajax is asynchronous
[09:17:15] <plln> i dont need to load images just i frame
[09:17:51] <nights> yes
[09:17:55] <ajpiano> Joeytje50: http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/
[09:18:17] <chris____> hey folks - I'd like 'only' the vmouse* events from jquery mobile - and nothing else, anyone know how I would approach that?
[09:28:34] <bartmax> css question : how can I make a button:hover {} but only if the button is enabled ?
[09:28:40] <bartmax> button:enabled:hover?
[09:28:44] <bartmax> button:active:hover ?
[09:30:07] <bartmax> ok button:active:hover works thxs :D
[09:34:04] <gener1c> does $(".class") return a regular javascript array?
[09:34:25] <gener1c> or a regular object?
[09:35:00] <ajpiano> it returns a jQuery object
[09:37:35] <gener1c> ok so how do i get a single element from within it using an index ?
[09:38:03] <ajpiano> gener1c: do you want an actual DOM element or a jQuery object with said DOM element
[09:38:04] <gener1c> i tried using the simple [] literal but that resulted in a none jquery object

[09:42:43] <xenaxon> I'm trying to do an on-hover effect for images
[09:42:54] <xenaxon> 	$("#tint").hover(function() {
[09:42:54] <xenaxon> 	  alert("Handler for .click() called.");
[09:42:54] <xenaxon> 	});
[09:43:09] <xenaxon> if I replace #tint with div, and click a div, the alert shows up
[09:43:17] <xenaxon> but it doesn't show up by clicking the element with that id
[09:43:19] <xenaxon> no idea why
[09:43:23] <xenaxon> the element is an img
[09:43:48] <xec_> xenaxon: use a pastebin for code please, preferably a live one like jsfiddle.net
[09:44:08] <xec_> xenaxon: that said, it looks like you're expecting .hover() to bind to a click event?
[09:44:08] <Angelos_> lol... okay here goes nothing. I have a page with 2 or more jQuery scripts on it. The scripts work isolated, but when ran togather they don't work. I am not completely sure if this has to do with the version of jQuery or the order in which the library is pulled. I have attached the script for your viewing, if somebody can see it, maybe I might have to fluss the script - http://pastebin.com/Jzb1FFtv
[09:44:27] <xenaxon> no xec_
[09:44:34] <xenaxon> I've tried both click and hover.
[09:44:39] <xenaxon> and neither activate

[09:44:42] <bot-t> xenaxon, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:44:54] <Angelos_> should I do the same?
[09:45:19] <xec_> please do, hard to tell what static code does :)
[09:45:46] <pajo> can anyone tell me why ezBgResize doesn't work in internet explorer before i've pressed F5 ?
[09:46:16] <pajo> https://github.com/iamjpg/jQuery-Ez-Background-Resize <- it says here that it requires with/height for IE
[09:46:39] <pajo> how can add them?
[09:47:04] <pajo> in similar matter as img : 'my/path' ??
[09:47:25] <Chopps> hey guys, this is a general js/jquery question, im testing my code on my pc, but i dont see the changes, i even add alerts to see if the code is being executed, but not even the alerts get executed, and i know my code is correct and all changes saved, is there anything i can do so i can see the changes on the browser on update??
[09:47:38] <xec_> pajo: maybe they mean in the html source? like <img width="19" height="19"> ?
[09:47:58] <pajo> no, no, no, it's body's background
[09:48:09] <pajo> no img tag
[09:48:17] <xec_> oh i see
[09:48:37] <plln> Chopps: ctrl+R / ctrl+F5
[09:48:45] <plln> ctrl+shif+f5
[09:48:48] <plln> pick one
[09:48:59] <xec_> pajo: yes, it does take height: and width: properties in the options object

[09:51:28] <pajo> i tried puttin the w/h to 100 and 100, but the background stayed the same
[09:51:47] <pajo> didn't seem to do anything
[09:51:55] <pajo> but why does it work after i've pressed F5
[09:52:01] <pajo> that's strange
[09:52:16] <xenaxon> xec_: can you check my code?
[09:52:30] <xec_> xenaxon: looking. what is .onmousein() ? some plugin?
[09:52:52] <xec_> what do you expect this demo to do
[09:54:01] <xec_> xenaxon: .click() seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/mPcSr/1/ <-- try clicking the image
[09:54:39] <Angelos_> ok I've uploaded the code, go here if you like, http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/clients/sitepoint/jquery/index_1.htm, the issue is with the jQuery script, I don't know if you need to flush it or something. I find that the problem resolve when I get only one of the scripts to work. PS: can you also let me know how you debug it.
[09:55:15] <xenaxon> no
[09:55:17] <xenaxon> it's jkust wrong
[09:55:23] <xec_> what is?
[09:55:31] <xec_> xenaxon: i also see a problem with the .hover() earlier - it's inside a loop which means you're binding many times over
[09:55:35] <pajo> xec_: w*h = 2000*1000 but still nothing, still wants me to refresh it
[09:55:43] <xenaxon> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/mPcSr/
[09:55:45] <xenaxon> check it now
[09:56:02] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mPcSr/2/
[09:56:38] <pajo> even jquery.ready doesn't affect anything
[09:56:58] <xenaxon> your point pajo?
[09:57:01] <xec_> pajo: i'm not familiar with that plugin - could you make a small demonstration?
[09:57:20] <xenaxon> xec_: can you check the code now? http://jsfiddle.net/mPcSr/2/
[09:57:34] <xenaxon> xec_: I've made it work on jsfiddle, but the same code is not working on my server
[09:57:37] <xenaxon> that's just strange
[09:57:57] <xec_> xenaxon: well, then there is something else stopping it from working
[09:57:59] <pajo> i don't know, but maybe it has something todo with a non-loaded image
[09:58:09] <pajo> because after F5 it works fine
[09:58:12] <Angelos_> Hi
[09:58:19] <xec_> xenaxon: and i can't even begin to guess without seeing it firsthand
[09:58:20] <pajo> just my thought, probably wrong :P
[09:58:42] <xec_> pajo: could be. try load event rather than ready, perhaps?
[09:59:03] <pajo> load event?
[09:59:09] <xenaxon> stopping what?
[09:59:34] <xenaxon> xec_: it works if I don't use a id/class in $() and I use just div/body etc
[09:59:38] <xec_> pajo: $(document).load(func) rather than $(document).ready(func)
[09:59:41] <xenaxon> but not when I use div or class or img
[10:00:16] <Angelos_> I uploaded the files here http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/clients/sitepoint/jquery/index_1.htm, the slider on the top-right won't display.
[10:00:59] <pajo> xec_: nope, nothing... i have 2 different templates too. one has jquery ready and the other doesn't. neither of them work
[10:01:41] <xec_> pajo: does it work in a pared-down testcase?
[10:02:21] <xec_> Angelos_: $ is not jQuery
[10:02:54] <xec_> Angelos_: try jQuery(function($){ /* now $ is jQuery */ })
[10:03:20] <xec_> Angelos_: instead of the $(function(){ ... you have
[10:03:25] <pajo> xec_: haven't tried it
[10:03:31] <pajo> but i guess i can try
[10:03:42] <pajo> i'll probably be back in some time :P
[10:07:08] <xec_> Angelos_: edited your pastebin http://pastebin.com/efR1phHV
[10:07:49] <Angelos_> I uploaded the files http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/clients/sitepoint/jquery/index_1.htm
[10:07:53] <Angelos_> It's all in there
[10:08:37] <xec_> Angelos_: doesn't look changed to me - did you understand what i wrote?
[10:09:09] <Angelos_> I went to get food
[10:09:16] <Angelos_> and I only just came back
[10:09:20] <xec_> scroll up? :P
[10:10:06] <Angelos_> $ is not jQuery? where did you find ttis?
[10:10:19] <xec_> Angelos_: do you know what the console is?
[10:10:26] <Angelos_> nope
[10:10:34] <Angelos_> I think I am what you call a noob
[10:10:40] <xec_> Angelos_: do you have chrome? or firebug for firefox?
[10:10:43] <Angelos_> ye
[10:10:48] <Angelos_> both
[10:10:50] <Angelos_> all
[10:10:59] <xec_> ok, in firebug you have a console tab
[10:11:09] <Angelos_> ok
[10:11:11] <shwaiil> Q: I'm reading ( http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ), but not understanding "Because the plugin returns the this keyword in its immediate scope...". What do they mean with "in its immediate scope" ?
[10:11:12] <xec_> where you can type javascript directly
[10:11:12] <shwaiil> Tks
[10:11:26] <Angelos_> I ok
[10:11:30] <Angelos_> I am there, it's enabled now
[10:11:39] <xec_> Angelos_: so, you can type something like $('#slides')
[10:11:45] <xec_> Angelos_: and see what you get back
[10:12:20] <xec_> Angelos_: "null" right? now try jQuery('#slides')
[10:12:21] <Angelos_> ? it's says illegal characters_ u sure u just type in "#slides"
[10:12:22] <bot-t> Angelos_, #5539 (Event target is wrong on DOMCharacterDataModified ... - Opened 16 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5539#slides"
[10:12:59] <xec_> Angelos_: type in the entire thing including dollar sign and parens
[10:13:36] <Angelos_> >>> jQuery('#slides')
[10:13:36] <Angelos_> jQuery(div#slides)
[10:13:42] <Angelos_> this is what it says
[10:13:47] <xec_> yes
[10:13:53] <Angelos_> this is good?
[10:13:54] <xec_> do you get the same using $ ?
[10:14:13] <Angelos_> instead of the #?
[10:14:21] <xec_> instead of jQuery ...
[10:14:39] <Angelos_> $slides? like this?
[10:14:41] <gataraid> http://www.puroclean.com/ - there is a dropdown here, that Im trying to get styled by or used in the wordpress cms
[10:14:41] <xec_> no
[10:14:50] <gataraid> I'm trying to find something I can read in order to accomplish this
[10:15:19] <xec_> Angelos_: what code did you write in order to try and make a slider?
[10:16:03] <Angelos_> I did not write any, it's ready-made
[10:16:12] <Angelos_> I am just trying to make it work on my site
[10:16:22] <xec_> Angelos_: it's just a plugin - it won't do much on it's own
[10:16:25] <rikkipitt> Hey guys, anyone know the best way to use a form to update it's own action? I need to use 2 fields to vary up to 2 numbers within the action url? Doable?
[10:16:44] <xec_> Angelos_: you have http://pastebin.com/efR1phHV <-- line 35
[10:17:16] <Angelos_> hold on...
[10:17:38] <xec_> Angelos_: i gotta go - this is very basic, read some tutorials
[10:17:45] <xec_> good luck
[10:17:52] <Angelos_> ok thanks :)
[10:17:58] <Angelos_> it's from a premade script I got online
[10:18:24] <xec_> Angelos_: do you see the difference in that pastebin to the code on your live site?
[10:18:55] <Angelos_> ye
[10:18:59] <rikkipitt> for example, case-studies/case-study/:id/section/:id2
[10:19:22] <rikkipitt> how would I change :id and :id2 in the forms action using input boxes?
[10:19:38] <Angelos_> it works now
[10:19:46] <Angelos_> thanks
[10:19:49] <Angelos_> :)
[10:20:42] <skylamer`> rikkipitt, may be look for the val and make that the action of the element formz? :)
[10:21:32] <rikkipitt> hi skylamer, but how do I target the :id part of the action?
[10:21:47] <rikkipitt> do I use a special javascript placeholder for example?
[10:26:24] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/Je7Q9/3/  is my thinking/math faulty on this? unless I do the -5px and -4/5px to the margins, I wind up with scrollbars in a full-screen window
[10:26:34] * WebDragon *scratches his head*
[10:26:54] <WebDragon> I can't see where I'm getting the extra 9-10px that cause the scrollbars to appear on the right
[10:27:19] <WebDragon> (I'm just playin around with this as an exercise, so don't take it too seriously)
[10:31:04] <rikkipitt> how would I change :id and :id2 in the forms action using input boxes?
[10:31:11] <rikkipitt> is it reliably doable?
[10:31:39] <rikkipitt> i need to use input boxes to change up to 2 numbers in a forms action url
[10:32:07] <DerekPioneer> i have a selector like $('.product-img-box .product-image img'), but it is also selecting ".product-image img"s outside of the div class product-img-box, how do i only select the img's inside of the div class product-img-box?
[10:32:29] <minna> Hi
[10:32:47] <minna> Doesn't .children match nested elements?
[10:33:02] <jonclark> minna, only direct descendants
[10:33:03] <jonclark> try find()
[10:33:15] <minna> jonclark: Thanks, that was what i was looking for.
[10:33:24] <minna> jonclark: sometimes you just forget.
[10:33:26] <jonclark> :)
[10:33:49] <jonclark> DerekPioneer, that seelctor should work.. do you have any code you can paste?
[10:33:52] <jonclark> *selector
[10:35:04] <K3|Chris|Work> is there a simple way to make an element not trigger hoverout? I'm placing an element on top of another and want to hide it if I hover out, but if I hover the element itself it vanishes
[10:35:35] <jonclark> K3|Chris|Work, post your code: http://jsfiddle.net
[10:35:47] <K3|Chris|Work> thought it was clear enough...
[10:36:31] <jonclark> what you _want_ to do sounds clear, but there might be an error in your code that someone here could notice for ya
[10:36:51] <jonclark> you could try binding to "mouseover" instead of to "hover"
[10:37:44] <seltar> hey
[10:37:55] <seltar> anybody know about a good scalable hosting provider?
[10:38:02] <seltar> php
[10:38:19] <culh> If I have a function for more than 1 event, do I have to repeat it? e.g.:  $('.class').hover(function(e){...},function(e){...}).click(function(e){...});
[10:38:35] <seltar> yup
[10:38:42] <seltar> or
[10:38:42] <seltar> no
[10:38:45] <seltar> you can bind
[10:39:01] <seltar> bind("hover click")
[10:39:04] <ajpiano> culh: no, you can either give it a name and reference or do multiple events in the .on("click mouseenter mouseleave", fn);
[10:39:04] <Zzaichik> yep OR no
[10:39:11] <culh> well, then can I just make a separated function and call it instead or rewriting everytime?
[10:39:19] <ajpiano> yes, you can also do that
[10:39:33] <ajpiano> function foo() {};  $("#bar").click(foo);
[10:39:34] <culh> ajpiano: multiple events sounds better, ty
[10:39:51] <culh> then I can just use the same $(this)
[10:40:00] <culh> plus, binding is low performance I hear
[10:40:08] <ajpiano> you'd be able to use the same $(this) either way
[10:40:13] <ajpiano> um, ok.
[10:40:25] <ajpiano> whether you use an anonymous or named function, yo'ure still binding.
[10:40:29] <DerekPioneer> jonclark: http://jsfiddle.net/MuwBf/
[10:40:50] <jonclark> i'm setting some data-attributes on some elements by iterating over them with each(), but then when an event triggers and calls those data attributes, they don't exist. am i missing something?
[10:41:09] <ajpiano> jonclark: wat
[10:41:18] <jonclark> lemme paste fiddle aj, one sec
[10:41:29] <rikkipitt> hey guys, could i get some advice please?
[10:41:40] <rikkipitt> i have a form with up to 2 fields
[10:41:54] <rikkipitt> the fields need to update the forms action
[10:41:59] <K3|Chris|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/KriLL3/ReqCu/ here is an example of my code, notice how the yellow box vanishes if you hover it
[10:42:03] <K3|Chris|Work> I don't want it to
[10:42:22] <rikkipitt> for example hello/1/world/2
[10:42:36] <rikkipitt> where 1 and 2 and varied via the input fields
[10:42:44] <K3|Chris|Work> (hover the red boxes to see the yellow one)
[10:43:00] <DerekPioneer> $('.product-img-box .product-image img')      selects classes outside of the product-img-box div. http://jsfiddle.net/MuwBf/
[10:43:39] <K3|Chris|Work> jonclark: any ideas?
[10:44:35] <mspalmer1> Hey, I'm making elements with .append each with it's own id (edit1, edit2, edit3 etc), for each object made in the app, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to call them now. Any tips?
[10:46:37] <jonclark> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/xGeKx/1/ -- the "more" link should animate the height of the div wrapping around the list, main prob is the data can't be accessed
[10:46:54] <jonclark> K3|Chris|Work, one sec
[10:47:05] <ajpiano> jonclark: global variables :|
[10:47:32] <ajpiano> jonclark: when you use $.data the first arg has to be a dom element, not a jquery object
[10:49:10] <DerekPioneer> seems like my selector is selecting outside of its class. $('.product-img-box .product-image img')     http://jsfiddle.net/MuwBf/
[10:49:26] <DerekPioneer> ie .product-image img is being selected outside of .product-img-box class
[10:51:09] <jonclark> ajpiano: thanks, that worked
[10:51:20] <jonclark> ajpiano: just tacked on a [0] after the obj
[10:51:35] <ajpiano> jonclark: what's wrong with just doing $wrap.data("whatever")
[10:51:42] <ajpiano> DerekPioneer: pretty sure your html is somehow malformed
[10:51:56] <ajpiano> *all* that html shows as being inside of .product-img-box when you look at it in jsfiddle
[10:52:22] <jonclark> K3|Chris|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/ReqCu/2/
[10:53:51] <DerekPioneer> it is call inside product-img-box
[10:54:36] <ajpiano> DerekPioneer: fwiw, it's really bad to use <p> tags as generic content containers
[10:54:44] <DerekPioneer> yeah that's just magento stuff
[10:54:45] <DerekPioneer> not me
[10:54:46] <DerekPioneer> :P
[10:55:25] <abhinav_singh> i am using jquery autocomplete .. how many records i can have in local source .. will it affect performance if i have more than 20k records in local source ?
[10:56:06] <jonclark> ajpiano, you're right, i've used $derp.data(.. instead
[10:57:05] <K3|Chris|Work> jonclark: yeah I came up with that one also, but I do want yellow to hide when I hover out of red ;)
[10:57:11] <K3|Chris|Work> but not if I hover yellow
[10:57:13] <K3|Chris|Work> if that makes sense
[10:57:25] <jonclark> ah i get ya
[10:57:30] <Defusal> if anyone has experience with HighCharts and dynamically adding points, please let me know.
[10:57:40] <jonclark> cause when you mouse over the yellow you're techincally mousing out of the red
[10:57:45] <jonclark> i see
[10:57:46] <eddie_c> Hi everyone. I have a question. I just started a gig and they are using jquery 1.4.4. I know :(â¦ in IE8 when I do this: $('.class').bind('click',function(){alert('blah')); I it alerts blah immediately. This is inside a function that was called via an inline onclick.
[10:58:16] <eddie_c> Any idea why this is happening?
[10:58:43] <K3|Chris|Work> jonclark: yeah I know, hence why I asked how to work around that, if possible
[10:58:51] <jonclark> sry i misunderstood
[11:00:52] <jonclark> i'm afraid i can't come up with anything elegant for that off the top of my head :(
[11:00:55] <Lann> Any idea why $(document).ready() would execute immediately for me even before an inline document.write (which occurs afterwards in the page)? Why would document.ready execute BEFORE IT IS READY??!
[11:01:45] <eddie_c> Here is the js fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qWT6V/ in ie8 the alert is happening immediately
[11:02:02] <Defusal> Lann, ready is when javascript is initialized, load is when the page has loaded, as far as i know
[11:02:40] <eddie_c> Why would the alerty be happening immediatly?
[11:03:40] <Lann> Defusal: $(document).load() doesn't even fire at all
[11:04:29] <ajpiano> that's cause it's $(window).load(fn)
[11:05:07] <ajpiano> Lann: inline js isn't guaranteed to execute before document ready
[11:06:05] <crivera> why doesn't fadeIn apply to inner children of a div as well?
[11:06:15] <crivera> right now it's only toggling the parent div, but not touching the children
[11:06:27] <ajpiano> crivera: how could the children be visible if their parent is faded out
[11:06:39] <crivera> ajpiano: but i'm fading in the parent
[11:06:56] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "touching" the children
[11:06:59] <ajpiano> it should work just fine
[11:07:22] <crivera> ajpiano: the children divs are still display:none even after a fadeIn on the parent
[11:07:22] <crivera> hrmm
[11:07:27] <Noeble> question: I have an issue with my jquery code. add_recipient works, but I cant get my remove_recipient to trigger at all. The remove_recipient objects are created from the add_recipient trigger. http://dpaste.com/715945/
[11:07:44] <ajpiano> crivera: doing fadeIn on an element doesn't magically go clean up inline styles on any of the elements children
[11:08:01] <eddie_c> oh, snap I met you at sxsw like 2 or 3 yrs ago ajpiano. You were wearing a sweet shirt and I complemented you on it.
[11:08:07] <ajpiano> fadeIn and fadeOut work on the elements on which they're called
[11:08:17] <ajpiano> eddie_c: omg i remember you
[11:08:21] <eddie_c> @crivera this is where get all your js knowledgeâ¦  I know your secret now!
[11:08:47] <crivera> hells ya
[11:10:24] <jeffsmykil> Do I have this syntax correct?  <a href="" class="logo_link" onclick="function() {return: false;}"></a>
[11:10:30] <eddie_c> how you been ajpiano?
[11:10:41] <eddie_c> not doing sxsw this year?
[11:10:41] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: really bro
[11:10:49] <jeffsmykil> REALLY
[11:10:52] <ajpiano> eddie_c: yea haven't been back to sxsw since then, been to austin a few times since
[11:10:56] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: return: ???
[11:11:01] <ajpiano> where did you pull this from
[11:11:07] <jeffsmykil> i always fuck up
[11:11:07] <jeffsmykil> prevent default
[11:11:09] <jeffsmykil> duh
[11:11:12] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: after all these months why don't you just shoot me in the face
[11:11:14] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: no man
[11:11:20] <ajpiano> return doesn't take a bloody colon after it
[11:11:30] <ajpiano> in an inline event handler no less
[11:11:31] <jeffsmykil> oh damn
[11:12:25] <eddie_c> Hey ajpiano any chance you could look at my code snippet and tell my how to hack around ie8?
[11:12:36] <ajpiano> maybe
[11:12:38] <eddie_c> http://jsfiddle.net/qWT6V/2/
[11:13:00] <ajpiano> good lawd
[11:13:03] <eddie_c> IE8 is doing the alert right when I bind the handler
[11:13:11] <eddie_c> :)
[11:13:27] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/Je7Q9/3/  is my thinking/math faulty on this? unless I do the -5px and -4/5px to the margins, I wind up with scrollbars in a full-screen window
[11:13:34] <Abnormalex> is this = document.ready? $(function() {
[11:13:51] <WebDragon> Abnormalex: shortcut, yes
[11:13:55] <Abnormalex> thansk]
[11:14:11] <WebDragon> I can't recall whether it's precisely == document.ready
[11:14:17] <ajpiano> yes, it's shorthand
[11:14:23] <jonclark> K3|Chris|Work, sorry man, i tried some things but no luck
[11:14:28] <WebDragon> heya ajpiano
[11:14:36] * WebDragon slides over the carafe of DragonCoffeeâ¢ 
[11:14:46] <WebDragon> Sumatra today
[11:15:14] <ajpiano> woo
[11:15:40] <eddie_c> also, keep in mind I am using jquery 1.4.4â¦ sadly
[11:15:42] <WebDragon> :D
[11:15:54] <ajpiano> WebDragon: your thinking is faulty in making a layout that depends on javascript
[11:15:55] <ajpiano> :|
[11:16:10] <WebDragon> ajpiano: well yeah, it's just a curiosity
[11:16:21] <ajpiano> eddie_c: can you make a fiddle that illustrates it breaking in IE
[11:16:28] <Noeble> question: I have an issue with my jquery code. add_recipient works, but I cant get my remove_recipient to trigger at all. The remove_recipient objects are created from the add_recipient trigger. http://dpaste.com/715945/
[11:17:03] <WebDragon> I just wanted to figure a way to manipulate the layout for splashscreen sake on a holding page, for the skeleton framework we've slowly accreted over time
[11:17:42] <ajpiano> Noeble: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[11:17:49] <ajpiano> not that you're doing ajax, but the same problem exists
[11:17:52] <WebDragon> had some fun playing with it while idling waiting for boss to get me the colorbucket for the next design
[11:18:08] <ajpiano> Noeble: crazy idea would also be to not use global variables for every single thing
[11:18:14] <ajpiano> unless you want to hate your life down the line
[11:19:05] <ajpiano> Noeble: you can use $(document).on("click", ".add_recipient", fn).on("click", ".remove_recipient", fn) to do your bindings
[11:19:17] <Noeble> ajpiano: hmm
[11:19:18] <ajpiano> and then it will do event delegation on the document and alll your handlers will work regardless of when the elements are crated it
[11:19:21] <ajpiano> created*
[11:20:52] <Noeble> ajpiano: Iam no jquery pro.. but I only declared 2 gloval vars?
[11:20:55] <Noeble> global-
[11:21:14] <ajpiano> Noeble: any time you declare a variable without "var" it's global
[11:21:20] <Noeble> ajpiano: mm ok
[11:21:55] <Noeble> ajpiano: could you perhaps do a small example using the $(document).on("click with my code as base?
[11:22:47] <slb_> is there an easy way to have a form in a non modal dialog post back into that form without using ajax post
[11:22:56] <ajpiano> i already gave you a relatively clear example
[11:23:16] <slb_> me?
[11:23:17] <ajpiano> you literally just have to replace lines 45 and 56 with $(document).on("click", "selector", function() { ....
[11:23:20] <ajpiano> instead of what you have now
[11:23:32] <ajpiano> slb_: no
[11:23:52] <ajpiano> slb_: you know how like, in irc there are conversations before you get into a room
[11:23:55] <Noeble> ajpiano: ill give it a shot :)
[11:24:29] <slb_> yes but u had said it right after it was just a misunderstaning you dont have to be sarcastic
[11:25:37] <ajpiano> surely i said it so soon after your question and clearly your having only been here only 20 seconds at that point and never having spoken to me before would be a clear indication that no i didn't mean you :)
[11:25:38] <ajpiano> ANYWAY
[11:25:44] <ajpiano> let's not get caught up in meta nonsense :)
[11:26:13] <slb_> indeed
[11:26:40] <WebDragon> I sense a disturbance in the SubEthaNet
[11:27:25] <Noeble> ajpiano: it worked like a charm! ty
[11:27:37] <ajpiano> slb_: are you referring to like an ASP "postback" specifically or just the generic idea of a form posting to the same page as the page that it's on
[11:28:42] <slb_> im referring to a ui dialog and having my submission remain in the dialog
[11:28:48] <slb_> im not familiar with asp postback
[11:28:59] <ajpiano> me neither, so that's good news
[11:29:11] <slb_> basically the post is to the same page already and on click i have the link load into a dialog
[11:29:13] <ajpiano> except that they always break anything nice people want to do with ajax in ASP :)
[11:29:30] <ajpiano> slb_: you can't have a form post without ajax and not have a page navigation
[11:29:55] <slb_> i was thinking i can use one of those jquery form plugins that convert the forms to ajax
[11:30:09] <ajpiano> i thought you didn't want to use ajax
[11:30:21] <slb_> i didnt but if i have to i will
[11:30:41] <slb_> i was thinking that as plan b if there was no other way to do what i'm thinking
[11:30:46] <ajpiano> the other option is to do a standard post and then write javascript to detect when the page has been loaded via having been posted to and reload the dialog with the new information
[11:30:58] <slb_> yea thats a good point/idea
[11:31:21] <TheJohlin> Hey, when I use the on() function to capture an event, do I need to pass the function the event parameter?
[11:31:25] <slb_> which do u think is better solution the one you just proposed or just the turning the form to ajax
[11:31:37] <ajpiano> slb_: i would probably go with ajax
[11:31:47] <slb_> the reason id use the form plugin is because id like to keep it backwards compatible in the case of a browser of preference of no dialog i can shut it off simply
[11:31:52] <ajpiano> submitting a form over ajax is an established paradigm and works great, exactly.
[11:32:03] <ajpiano> the other approach is hacky and kinda gross
[11:32:04] <ajpiano> lol
[11:32:08] <slb_> lol i know
[11:32:24] <ajpiano> TheJohlin: only if you need to use the event object in the handler
[11:32:37] <slb_> thanks a lot i will go with this form plugin concept
[11:33:08] <TheJohlin> Of course, but the reason that I'm asking is that I discovered that I don't need to pass it in Chrome
[11:33:28] <slb_> i was going to use "jquery form plugin" but in the case it is not that great i can just write my own situation
[11:33:40] <ajpiano> slb_: the jquery form plugin works great
[11:33:46] <TheJohlin> The event object is still there,but when I tested it in firefox it didn't work
[11:34:01] <slb_> ajpiano this one right: http://jquery.malsup.com
[11:34:10] <ajpiano> TheJohlin: there's also window.event hanging around, so you're probably referring to that
[11:34:14] <slb_> im not sure if theres a more official one im missing out on
[11:34:26] <ajpiano> TheJohlin: but you probably actually want the jquery normalised event object
[11:34:29] <ajpiano> slb_: that's the one
[11:34:42] <slb_> danke :)
[11:35:04] <TheJohlin> ajpiano: Ok, thanks for the info!
[11:36:39] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, is it possible to modify jquery's .extend metho to accept "false" in the first paramenter to invoke the action that only the attributes of the second parameter are optionally copied over in the third (and subsequent) paramters?
[11:37:09] <ajpiano> ummm
[11:37:33] <ajpiano> so you mean, change it so it extends in the completley opposite direction?
[11:37:48] <ajpiano> i prob wouldn't wedge that into extend
[11:38:46] <Whirl3d> cool. Thanks for the reply. I'll just write a func myself that replaces the values (optionally) of one object with another (or set of others)
[11:39:07] <ajpiano> isn't that.. what extend does
[11:40:03] <Whirl3d> if I extend these two:   {foo:bar, dest:bat}, {foo:bat, dest:something, everything:else}, my resulting object includes everything:else
[11:40:07] <Whirl3d> which I don't want
[11:40:31] <ajpiano> oh i got it, you only want it to copy over shared properties
[11:40:42] <Whirl3d> yeah, basically
[11:41:16] <Whirl3d> but I was hoping to do it in one function, $.extend(false, obja, objb) would copy shared,
[11:42:15] <Whirl3d> but I can create a custom function to do it, I just wondered if logically that was counterproductive to the extend concept or if it was a logical extension of the deepcopy feature of extend.
[11:52:26] <miznitic> Is there a way to make .change() trigger if the val has been changed from a separate JS function?
[11:58:13] <miznitic> Is there a way to make .change() trigger if the val has been changed from a separate JS function?
[12:00:29] <Whirl3d> miznitc, have the other function trigger the change event when it changes the value
[12:03:41] <N3tw0rK> shouldnt the following code hide the element with id results when the button with id test_button is clicked?   http://pastebin.com/bMbMPTLd
[12:03:43] <miznitic> Whirl3d - That would be an obvious answer. Unfortunately, it is one that cannot be done.
[12:05:13] <Whirl3d> you could setup a setInterval check once the element was focused and then destroy the interval check when the value was changed or lost focus?
[12:05:20] <Whirl3d> sorry, looking now...
[12:06:00] <miznitic> I'm dealing with ASP.NET hell and the normal sensible methods don't apply.
[12:06:20] <Whirl3d> N3tw0rK, yes it should
[12:07:52] <acidjazz> wtf cant i properly display high ascii characters

[12:08:18] <mehale> when adding multiple UL UIÂ´s, to have a nice pile stacking effect, is it ok to use prepend(Â´<li>blah</li>Â´).hide().fadeIn(); ? or is there a better/clever way?
[12:10:05] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: any idea why it won
[12:10:11] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: http://bit.ly/x1ZFDl
[12:10:54] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: pushing the "test_button" should hide the table
[12:15:33] <tran4> I'm a senior CS undergrad. student.  I applied directly to a company for these co-op and intern positions: http://pastebin.com/LdAH6eaZ  Are they worth doing?  I have no reply from the company but did get contacted by a recruiter whose ad I also applied to (the ad didnt say he was a recruiter) who wants to talk to me about the co-op position. Should i respond to him? The recruiter's ad has $14 / hr listed. The other legit ad that had a li
[12:15:46] <Whirl3d> is it possible that by not including your click handler in $(document).ready() that it never gets bound?
[12:16:15] <Whirl3d> try $(document).ready(function () {$("#test_button............}); to see if it works
[12:16:44] <skylamer`> its possible
[12:16:50] <ShawnRisk> how do I show an external page div only in jquery thickbox?
[12:17:29] <mehale> when adding multiple UL UIÂ´s, to have a nice pile stacking effect, is it ok to use prepend(Â´<li>blah</li>Â´).hide().fadeIn(); ? or is there a better/clever way?
[12:20:57] <Whirl3d> mehale, I'm not sure what you are trying t accomplish and I'm not sure if prepend  requires a sibmiling of the li children to prepend to or whther prepend on a ul element adds the contents  as it's first child using preprend. I'ld look it up api.jqeryy.com/prepend...the source: $("li.existing").preprend("li")
[12:21:08] <student1> $("#id").text("new") is updating the value in the DOM but the new result is not seen in the html form in the browser!
[12:21:33] <mehale> Whirl3d: ok, thanks
[12:21:42] <mehale> actually I want to add new lines to the top of the list
[12:22:38] <skylamer`> student1, its value
[12:22:44] <skylamer`> for the input elements :)
[12:22:45] <Whirl3d> sure, but if you prepend a ul, it should add the content before the ul? or before it's first decendant?
[12:22:51] <student1> skylamer`: thanks, val() worked
[12:23:10] <Whirl3d> you could use .before() and ul li:first to add it to tthe top
[12:23:50] <ShawnRisk> how do I take <div id="test">Hello</div> within test.html and place that in a jquery thickbox on another page example.html?  I only want the text within the the test div to show up nothing else.  Any ideas on how to do that?
[12:24:54] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: i tried adding what you said it still will not work, but should i put all the function in http://goo.gl/RSUlE inside $(document).ready clause?
[12:25:21] <Whirl3d> sounds like you should check the thickbox api. Or you could load the page into an hidden div using load and then pull the text for your thickbox
[12:25:57] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: yes but there will be more than 1 page and different each time.
[12:28:46] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, so create a function that takes the page url and the target content's id (or selector) and use load and thuckibox to show it each time.  So, function nexthelp(src, targ) { var d=$("#hidden").load(src+" "+targ, function (data) {thickbox(data);}); or something along those lines
[12:29:26] <ShawnRisk> okay
[12:30:36] <Whirl3d> N3tw0rK, the think you have to keep in mind is that you can't bind anything to an element that doesn't exist. So you want all of your bindings to register only AFTER you are sure they are loaded. That's why you wrap all of it in $("doucment").ready()...or $(function() {....});
[12:31:33] <Whirl3d> but ShawnRisk, read up on the thickbox API first. I am pretty sure they have options for doing what you want built-in.
[12:32:16] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: really, I don't see that
[12:34:22] <Whirl3d> so, ShawnRisk, this doesn't help? http://blog.davidjclarke.co.uk/jquery-thickbox-on-ajax-generated-pages.html
[12:36:11] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: nope because that links to external page, but I only want a div within that page to show up.
[12:37:05] <Whirl3d> .load will allow you to only load a div out of a page. Load it into a hidden div, then call thickbox
[12:37:56] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: isn't that a bit crazy?
[12:38:11] <Whirl3d> how so?
[12:38:41] <Whirl3d> How else do you expect to be able to load a page fragment and display it if your arent....loading a page fragment and then displaying it?
[12:39:29] <Whirl3d> you could load it into ajax (without attaching it to the dom), then find your content and display it
[12:40:15] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: you are loading content from one page wice?
[12:40:51] <Whirl3d> if it's the same page, different fragments, load the whole page into a hidden div and select the fragments as you need them
[12:41:17] <N3tw0rK> ok ive moved everything inside the $(document).ready but still the same results, im not sure what im doing wrong here, even the validation code for the search box isnt working http://goo.gl/RSUlE
[12:43:21] <Whirl3d> N3twork, are you familiar with jsfiddle? if you could create a working example, it'd be easier to find the problem.
[12:43:36] <Whirl3d> and by working, I mean not working, but you know what I mean...
[12:44:00] <xboi209> Is it possible I can make checkboxes stay checked through jquery?
[12:44:37] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: im not familiar with it but i will familiarize myself :)....
[12:45:00] <topriddy> is there a jquery optimized for mobile browsing, or can i just go ahead and use normal jquery?
[12:45:18] <Whirl3d> topriddy, jqmobile
[12:45:43] <Whirl3d> xboi209, yes.
[12:45:50] <topriddy> i just want to write an onclick id element handler and page rerouter
[12:45:55] <topriddy> Whirl3d: but then am still going to use same on web!
[12:46:07] <topriddy> Whirl3d: i mean i want it to work for both web and mobile
[12:46:08] <xboi209> How would I do it?
[12:46:23] <systemfault> topriddy: Perhaps you would prefer zepto then
[12:46:33] <topriddy> systemfault: what is zepto?
[12:46:49] <systemfault> topriddy: It's jquery-like but much lighter... because they care about mobile.
[12:47:04] <systemfault> http://zeptojs.com/
[12:47:07] <Whirl3d> rough
[12:47:19] <xboi209> Whirl3d, how would I do it?
[12:47:24] <topriddy> systemfault: checking it out
[12:47:38] <imsky> :D
[12:47:53] <systemfault> topriddy: It's also compatible with backbone.js if you're into that.
[12:47:58] <Whirl3d> xboi209, I'll tell you when you can tell me how long this piece of string is
[12:48:12] <xboi209> what?
[12:48:22] <Whirl3d> my point exactly
[12:48:34] <xboi209> ???
[12:48:39] <topriddy> systemfault: 7.4kb. **rolling my eyes***
[12:49:18] <Whirl3d> There are more than a million different ways that you could have your document setup. How am I supposed to guess the right way for your configuration?
[12:49:54] <Whirl3d> It's as easy for me to guess your situation as it would be for you to guess how long a piece of string is without seeing it or knowing anything about it
[12:49:57] <xboi209> idk...
[12:50:04] <Zzaichik> ah Google...
[12:50:34] <xboi209> Ok well I dont think I need to give you a code, let's just say 2 checkboxes and no submit button
[12:51:23] <xboi209> would it be possible through jquery to keep them checked and unchecked when a user wants to change it?
[12:51:27] <xboi209> without cookies
[12:51:50] <Whirl3d> $("input:checkbox").change(function () {$(this).prop("checked",true);}); or something similar
[12:52:07] <Guest9554> (jQueryUI) I've been using Draggable and Sortable (Linked via Draggable's connectToSortable option) and I'm wondering if there is anything I can use to improve the usability of the drag & drop stuff?
[12:52:07] <Guest9554>  at the moment dragging things out of the draggable and into the sortable is a hit and miss issue
[12:52:07] <Guest9554>  There seems to be no rhyme to whether or not it will drop on the (currently hovered) sortable position or not
[12:52:25] <Whirl3d> $("input:checkbox").change(function () {$(this).val("checked", true);}); maybe....not sure
[12:53:06] <xboi209> oh and i forgot one more thing
[12:53:13] <imsky> $(this).val("checked") lol
[12:53:17] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/UNGAS/ not sure if i did that right becuase the jquery post call isnt posting
[12:53:20] <xboi209> I'll need a function to execute if it's checked or not
[12:53:36] <NoiseEee> Guest9554: maybe check out the "tolerance" option and specify 'pointer' or whatever makes sense for your app
[12:53:42] <em0vskangoura> What is the best and more correct way to bind an event to a button , which will Hide and Unhide a div by each click ?
[12:53:51] <imsky> ?toggle at em0vskangoura
[12:53:53] <bot-t> imsky, Couldn't find "toggle at em0vskangoura" in jQuery Docs.
[12:53:56] <imsky> how dare you
[12:54:02] <Whirl3d> lol, imsky, can you tell I'm over it?
[12:54:07] <imsky> Whirl3d: over wat?
[12:54:17] <imsky> ?toggle @ em0vskangoura
[12:54:17] <bot-t> em0vskangoura, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[12:54:34] <em0vskangoura> Yeah i know about toggle. So its a correct way ?
[12:54:40] <imsky> no man
[12:54:43] <imsky> there's like 3 other ways
[12:54:52] <em0vskangoura> because toggle has 2 versions
[12:54:53] <imsky> you can find out about them in my jquery course, just $19.95
[12:55:00] <imsky> 4 easy payments!
[12:55:13] <imsky> "jQuery toggle: all 4 ways!"
[12:55:28] <em0vskangoura> imsky: :P Ok thanks :)
[12:55:32] <imsky> np bud
[12:56:11] <Guest9554> NoiseEee, seems to have worked
[12:56:16] <Guest9554> NoiseEee, thank you
[12:56:24] <NoiseEee> Guest9554: no problem
[12:58:46] <b1lly> im looping thru a few DOM elements and trying to inject each one into a table
[12:59:27] <Whirl3d> N3tw0rK, notice that your serach box is already in an anonymous function, so you don't need to add doc ready to it. It's fine. Your mapit button, however does need to be wrapped.
[12:59:46] <Whirl3d> $.each @b1lly
[12:59:49] <b1lly> do I need to append the table into the container and than append TO
[12:59:52] <b1lly> Whirl3d: i know that
[13:00:24] <b1lly> i want to inject the table elements and than move the image from the $.each to one of the TDs that i specify
[13:00:34] <b1lly> from the table i just injected
[13:01:20] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: so shouldnt it all be functioning now that its all included in the $(document).ready ? or does the anonymous function need to be removed?
[13:01:29] <Whirl3d> sounds like a good place for a fiddle., b1lly
[13:02:19] <Whirl3d> should be fine, I suspect. but I don't see the mapit button at all...looking again
[13:02:42] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/YhtEa/
[13:02:44] <b1lly> i want to basically
[13:03:10] <b1lly> add the img elements to the .photo element within the var photoFrame
[13:03:13] <b1lly> and replace it
[13:03:30] <b1lly> or inject the photoFrame and than move the img into the .photo element that was injected
[13:04:29] <hurry> how can i have default checked on radioButtonList?
[13:04:37] <hurry> ops sorry wrong channel
[13:06:37] <Whirl3d> perhaps it would be best to create the html then append it.
[13:07:38] <b1lly> Whirl3d: hm?
[13:10:31] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/YhtEa/ ?
[13:11:37] <Whirl3d> I'm still not clear on what you are trying to do. is the selector the image selector or the cell selector
[13:12:00] <b1lly> the selector is the
[13:12:01] <b1lly> img
[13:12:17] <b1lly> im basically trying to inject the photoFrame var
[13:12:23] <b1lly> i want to move
[13:12:26] <b1lly> the img element
[13:12:34] <b1lly> into the <td class="photo"></td>
[13:12:40] <Whirl3d> so, instead of the img, you want a grid of images
[13:13:11] <Whirl3d> or a grid with the image in it in one cell
[13:14:46] <b1lly> sure ya
[13:18:44] <Noeble> question: I have a form that I submit to a jquery script that does some things with the data.. that works now.. hoever the form field does an actual submit which fails the whole thing. Can I disable submit from a specific field?
[13:18:50] <Whirl3d> fiddle is being slow tonight
[13:24:36] <b1lly> is there a way to print out the entire html element and attributes and shit
[13:24:48] <b1lly> like if i did $(this) it returns [ Object Object ]
[13:25:01] <b1lly> when I want it to return <img src="blah.jpg" class="foo">
[13:27:09] <slb_> if i am dynamically created dialogs upon click shouldnt the open event be able to pull the content from the dialog being open?  i cant seem to use a selector for content inside a dialog that i know exists

[13:30:16] <DofLeFou> I have some very odd issue â¦. On Safari 5.1.x are there any know issues with AJAX POST
[13:30:43] <DofLeFou> I m currently seeing a behavior where my POST is failing on every other request
[13:30:58] <johnkpaul> how is it failing?
[13:31:10] <DofLeFou> with an error code 500
[13:31:21] <johnkpaul> why don't you think it's a server issue?
[13:31:29] <b1lly> whirl ya somthing like that yes
[13:31:31] <slb_> 500 is a server issue
[13:31:41] <slb_> internal server error
[13:32:08] <DofLeFou> should go hound my Server guys â¦ to look into it
[13:32:23] <johnkpaul> yes, you should DofLeFou, I figured that you thought that it wasn't a server issue
[13:32:30] <DofLeFou> I have it says tho i has been working on previous versions of Safari
[13:32:54] <johnkpaul> and it works in all of the other browsers?
[13:32:58] <DofLeFou> yes
[13:33:14] <DofLeFou> it works on Safari 5.0.x
[13:33:38] <DofLeFou> but only after some of my users upgraded to 5.1.x â¦ the behavior started
[13:35:14] <DofLeFou> forums.iis.net/p/1182376/1999172.aspx
[13:36:04] <johnkpaul> in chrome dev tools and/or firebug
[13:36:11] <johnkpaul> can you check to see if there is any difference in the two ajax calls?
[13:36:18] <johnkpaul> the headers and/or reuest body
[13:36:33] <DofLeFou> the body is empty
[13:36:59] <gehsekky> does the response from the server contain a ysod?
[13:37:11] <DofLeFou> i believe this should fix it http://forums.iis.net/p/1182376/1999172.aspx

[13:47:56] <warrenparsons> M4d3L1: .tabs() is not a built-in method for jQuery. Are you including another library?
[13:48:11] <M4d3L1> jquery ui
[13:50:43] <warrenparsons> M4d3L1: You're calling jQuery.js multiple times.
[13:51:00] <warrenparsons> M4d3L1: That will cause problems. Especially since one is 1.4 and the other is 1.7.
[13:54:38] <warrenparsons> M4d3L1: Also, it looks like the custom version of jQuery UI you're using does not include tabsâ¦

[14:03:27] <Woet> ?demo @ scr3am
[14:03:27] <bot-t> scr3am, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:03:56] <xec> scr3am: i'm going to guess you tried to "access" them before the elements were added to the DOM
[14:04:46] <scr3am> xec: possible, do you think a timeout would have solved the problem... i just added the code that i wanted to load... just a form...
[14:05:57] <xec> scr3am: timout might work but is a dirty hack.. just do it in the callback http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:06:04] <scr3am> xec: i know
[14:06:08] <xec> i.e. after the .load() is complete
[14:06:12] <sphinxxx> scr3am: you're probably accessing before the callback
[14:06:42] <sphinxxx> or if not, you might have the form cached , e.g.  var $form =('#form')
[14:07:19] <scr3am> i knew i did something wrong, i had not the time... i'll cached it, yeah
[14:07:52] <scr3am> xec: <-- i'll better use the callback ;-)
[14:08:28] <scr3am> <-- NOOB
[14:12:25] <Whirl3d> how does jquery handle dealing with all the possible paramters you can pass to a function? Like $("something").plugin("property, val) [set property to val]    or $(el).plugin(prop) [get property val]  or $(el).plugin(method, params)  [call method with params]   or $(el).plugin(method), [call method] or $(el).plugin() ]instantiate plugin]  ?
[14:15:01] <Flush> i was wondering is someone could help me with returning a value from $.getJSON
[14:15:16] <Flush> this might just be a very basic question of variable scope, but i can't figure it out
[14:15:44] <Flush> you can see what i'm trying to do here: http://jsfiddle.net/pstjean/YGHVW/1/
[14:17:05] <ringotwo_> flush, you should urlencode the longUrl arg
[14:17:18] <sphinxxx> Flush: shorturl isn't defined
[14:17:26] <ringotwo_> but to fix the problem, put 'return shortURL inside the getJSON block
[14:17:31] <sphinxxx> wait nvmind
[14:17:40] <ringotwo_> 'return shortURL'
[14:17:48] <sphinxxx> yea what ringotwo_ said
[14:18:01] <Flush> so i put that inside the getJSON block, and it will return it for the entire bitly function?
[14:18:37] <scr3am> works like a charm... thx guys...
[14:18:38] <ringotwo_> yes?
[14:18:56] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: how would I get the page I want to load the content from?  Like lets say I want to load example.com/store/a for one and example.com/store/b for another, ho would Id o that?  Your idea was: .load will allow you to only load a div out of a page. Load it into a hidden div, then call thickbox
[14:19:10] <ringotwo_> um, maybe not
[14:19:30] <LakWork> given a fixed width list of items, how can i determine that a given item in that list is outside the viewport of the screen
[14:19:31] <ringotwo_> yes, it should work
[14:19:35] <LakWork> (overflow is hidden)
[14:20:13] <sphinxxx> Flush:  no, it will only return within the immediate function
[14:20:15] <sphinxxx> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/YGHVW/4/
[14:21:04] <ringotwo_> oh nice
[14:21:19] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, if you know you aren't going to need "a" any more, just load"b" into the same div, erasing the "a" content
[14:21:42] <Whirl3d> if you think you might need access to the a content, creat another hidden div and load the content into it for "b"
[14:21:50] <ringotwo_> the callback for getJSON should just be: 'return data.data.url' and dont use a var called shortURL
[14:22:16] <Whirl3d> eventually, you'll want to figure out a better solution  all together than trying to grab lots of pieces from lots of files.
[14:22:33] <Flush> hmmm
[14:22:47] <Flush> so when i try what was in sphinxxx's jsfiddle i get an object
[14:23:03] <Flush> which actually seems to be the "getJSON" function itself
[14:23:08] <Flush> it's a lot of javascript
[14:23:24] <ringotwo_> why do you need to return anything?
[14:23:25] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: that is what I am thinking as that is not a good solution
[14:24:09] <dzenios> Hello guys.I have a problem which i hope you can help me solve it.I have a div which has 10 buttons.I listen for on click event on the div in order to know which button was pressed.This div now is auto updated through ajax every 5 seconds.The problem i have is that when ajax refreshes and updates the content of the div with the new buttons i have a race condition where i press a button and i dont receive the event.Any idea how this can be solved?
[14:24:24] <Flush> i'm working with bitly's API obviously, i just want to get the short URL back so i can manipulate it
[14:24:30] <Whirl3d> maybe you could compile all the content into a single file at load and then you don't have to do expensive load tasks.
[14:25:19] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: why can't thickbox or one of them similar do the job?
[14:25:49] <Whirl3d> It depends on what youa re trying to do...
[14:25:57] <Whirl3d> there's probably a much simpler solution
[14:25:57] <ringotwo_> you can do something like this instead:    bitly(url, callback)
[14:26:33] <dzenios> anyone?
[14:26:35] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: can I pm you?
[14:26:36] <Flush> ok, so i can just name a function and call it?
[14:26:39] <Flush> i'll try that
[14:26:40] <ringotwo_> supply the callback as the second argument
[14:26:51] <ringotwo_> sure
[14:26:57] <Flush> ok
[14:27:42] <Whirl3d> sure. I'm kinda swamped, but pm me if it's short
[14:27:58] <ringotwo_> bitly( url, function(data) { ... } );
[14:28:02] <ringotwo_> flush
[14:28:21] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: only links
[14:29:20] <Flush> ring, that's how i had it set up
[14:29:34] <Flush> what i'm confused about is how to get the return value from that callback function
[14:29:44] <ringotwo_> the return value is 'data' above
[14:30:28] <Flush> i want to be able to say bitly(url, var shortURL = function(data) { ... })
[14:30:39] <Flush> and then refer to shortURL later on in my script
[14:30:50] <Flush> obviously that doesn't work
[14:30:58] <sphinxxx> Flush: the way you originally had it is right, except that the 2nd return is being called too soon
[14:31:10] <sphinxxx> so its still undefined when the function returns
[14:31:40] <Flush> ok, is that do to the asynchronous nature of the AJAX call?
[14:31:43] <Flush> *due
[14:31:43] <ringotwo_> i can edit the fiddle
[14:32:01] <Flush> please do, that would be awesome
[14:32:01] <sunbeam> for a portfolio i am designing, i wish to design a slider like http://www.aaronmoody.co.uk/#work - can anybody tell me how i can best learn/design this?
[14:32:19] <sphinxxx> Flush: yeah
[14:33:34] <Flush> sunbeam, i've always used mike alsup
[14:33:47] <Flush> s cycle plugi for sliders: jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[14:34:03] <Flush> so maybe start with that and extend it. it's incredibly flexible.
[14:34:51] <Flush> sphinxxx how do i trigger that function to return at the right time?
[14:35:25] <sunbeam> thanks lets see
[14:36:06] <ringotwo_> flush: this is a way to do it
[14:36:08] <ringotwo_> http://jsfiddle.net/YGHVW/25/
[14:36:33] <dzenios> Hello guys.I have a problem which i hope you can help me solve it.I have a div which has 10 buttons.I listen for on click event on the div in order to know which button was pressed.This div now is auto updated through ajax every 5 seconds.The problem i have is that when ajax refreshes and updates the content of the div with the new buttons i have a race condition where i press a button and i dont receive the event.Any idea how this can be solved?
[14:36:51] <sphinxxx> ringotwo_ method should work
[14:37:01] <sphinxxx> your bitty needs a callback to know when to return
[14:37:06] <sphinxxx> bitly function*
[14:37:39] <ringotwo_> my bitty gets mad when i don't call back
[14:38:37] <dispyfree111> Hi. table.find(...).droppable({ ... }); << how can I access the current element affected by the filter inside droppable? I use a recent version of jquery
[14:39:43] <Flush> hahaha
[14:39:57] <Flush> thank you ringotwo_, thank you sphinxxx
[14:40:00] <Flush> that works great
[14:40:04] <Flush> i need to go read up on callbacks
[14:40:14] <ringotwo_> it's tricky stuff, man
[14:40:27] <Flush> yeah, i'm brand new to it
[14:40:29] <ringotwo_> took me a long time to understand
[14:40:46] <Flush> well i will just keep on plugging away XD
[14:40:57] <dispyfree111> any ideas?
[14:40:58] <ringotwo_> nice
[14:41:18] <ringotwo_> droppable() sounds like a UI widget
[14:41:59] <ringotwo_> droppable({}) contains options, i assume
[14:42:18] <ringotwo_> you can probably access options by using the namespace you provided in the UI widget
[14:42:43] <ringotwo_> yournamespace.widgetname.droppable.option('nameOfOption')
[14:43:10] <dispyfree111> I do not want to access the options but to access the current element from inside the options
[14:43:13] <Taktaal> does the jquery team ever update the documentation on their website?
[14:43:19] <imsky> sometimes
[14:43:25] <imsky> when it's really dark in the afternoon
[14:43:35] <ringotwo_> please post the code
[14:43:42] <Taktaal> i just spent almost an hour trying to get something to work that hasnt worked since jquery 1.3 :x
[14:43:49] <Faryshta> Hi. Is there a function on JQuery to hidde an element and at the same time show another one? Its easy to make I am just asking because I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
[14:44:15] <dispyfree111> http://pastebin.com/6S2B3Vw4 @ringotwo_
[14:45:42] <ringotwo_> you have to define the element first
[14:45:54] <ringotwo_> then pass it into the droppable()
[14:47:04] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to get this sliding panel to work to no prevail - http://pastebin.com/b4UpMwYT - chrome gives me a "Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function" error. Any ideas?
[14:47:09] <dispyfree111> I'm sure it's possible to access it from inside
[14:47:17] <ringotwo_> you're saying you want to get the $(this).closest('tr').attr('class') ?
[14:47:51] <dispyfree111> I want to get the object pointing to the currently processed td. as I can do everything with that td I first get it's tr and than do some stuff with it
[14:47:52] <ringotwo_> you want to return it?
[14:48:28] <ringotwo_> but in what scope do you want the object?
[14:48:51] <ringotwo_> you want it returned by droppable()
[14:48:59] <ringotwo_> i don't understand
[14:49:01] <Faryshta> Hi. Is there a function on JQuery to hidde an element and at the same time show another one? Its easy to make I am just asking because I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
[14:49:48] <dispyfree111> I need the current element somewhere inside droppable to define thte options @ringotwo_
[14:50:05] <Jon47> Faryshta, perhaps you might collect both elements into a jquery collection and use this: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[14:50:51] <Faryshta> Jon47, I will make that. I just didn't knew if it was already implemented.
[14:51:15] <ringotwo_> if you can post how the options would look, i can probably help
[14:52:27] <dispyfree111> drop: myfunc() @ringotwo_
[14:52:33] <dispyfree111> simple key:value -list
[14:56:16] <radiantstatic> any ideas?
[14:56:39] <ringotwo_> lemme look at droppable() docs
[15:00:35] <ringotwo_> don't you have to pass the event and ui args into the function referenced inside droppable()?
[15:02:01] <ringotwo_> $(element).droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { anotherFunction( this ); })
[15:02:43] <ringotwo_> this would be the droppable element
[15:07:30] <aaairc> how do you select the second instance of an element?
[15:08:06] <nFFF> ?nth-child
[15:08:07] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[15:08:21] <nFFF> or ?eq
[15:08:47] <nFFF> ?get
[15:08:48] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[15:09:08] <nFFF> or $('.ele')[1]
[15:09:32] <dispyfree111> yes works now @ringotwo_. thank you ^^
[15:09:53] <dispyfree111> I tried $(this), but directly in the options. if I do it in the function, everything works
[15:09:58] <aaairc> would you recommend the .get over the nth-child?
[15:10:00] <aaairc> approach
[15:10:11] <ringotwo_> yay
[15:10:40] <nFFF> aaairc, I guess it depends on your markup, but probably
[15:10:59] <nFFF> nth-child won't work in a lot of situations, depending on your markup
[15:18:21] <Flush> hey ringotwo_, thanks again!
[15:18:37] <ringotwo_> yeah, no problem
[15:18:43] <Flush> i just went and read up on callbacks and blocking vs. non-blocking functions, and that was the knowledge that i was missing XD
[15:19:14] <ringotwo_> nice
[15:19:25] <Flush> so now i've got everything in my app working
[15:19:37] <ringotwo_> and you can drink some beer
[15:19:46] <Flush> just used .append as opposed to trying to make it a blocking function
[15:19:47] <Flush> haha yeah
[15:20:01] <Flush> wheee!
[15:20:07] <ringotwo_> smoke a joint
[15:20:14] <M4d3L1> how I can put an exception for a tabs link to open in full windows? (no ajax)
[15:20:46] <ringotwo_> <a href="..." target="_new">
[15:21:18] <ringotwo_> exception for a tabs link... have no idea what that means
[15:21:24] <ringotwo_> jqueryUI tabs?
[15:21:57] <ringotwo_> what sort of exception?
[15:23:25] <M4d3L1> yeah for jqueryUI tabs. I have a link supose to open an other page. but tabs load it in ajax so I got head 2 time
[15:24:23] <ringotwo_> umm, can you post the javascript?
[15:24:41] <ringotwo_> "head 2 time" what does that mean
[15:26:11] <M4d3L1> http://iwp.dev.blsol.com/index.php/fr/immeubles/6955-taschereau see
[15:26:48] <M4d3L1> and I dont put any id on that link! I need tabs to ignore it
[15:26:52] <M4d3L1> is it possbile?
[15:28:33] <ringotwo_> i see it looks messed up
[15:28:43] <ringotwo_> but i'm not sure what you're trying to do, please explain more, thanks
[15:28:58] <ringotwo_> you want the Immeubles link to pop open a new window?
[15:29:19] <M4d3L1> just follow the link as normal link
[15:29:31] <ringotwo_> what link?
[15:29:34] <M4d3L1> better exemple : http://iwp.dev.blsol.com/index.php/fr/immeubles/7055-taschereau
[15:30:10] <M4d3L1> PHOTO is the only link to open normaly and not in tabs
[15:30:42] <ringotwo_> ohhh
[15:30:44] <M4d3L1> all other are table content.
[15:30:52] <ringotwo_> you want to pop open a new window
[15:30:54] <ringotwo_> ?
[15:30:58] <M4d3L1> current windows
[15:31:18] <ringotwo_> i don't know what that means, sorry
[15:32:21] <ringotwo_> more details, please
[15:32:41] <M4d3L1> what is complicated!â¦. you clic on photo. it is loaded via ajax in a div. I dont want that
[15:32:54] <M4d3L1> I want a NORMAL link
[15:33:30] <ringotwo_> you want to go to a different page?
[15:33:41] <M4d3L1> yeah else to load it in ajax
[15:33:52] <M4d3L1> I dont want any ajax call
[15:35:06] <ringotwo_> so your issue is not with the tabs, it's with the photos
[15:35:08] <ringotwo_> ?
[15:37:00] <ringotwo_> this is complicated to me, i can't understand what you want to do
[15:37:31] <ringotwo_> you say there is a photo that loads with ajax
[15:38:05] <ringotwo_> but the issue is not that it loads with ajax, but that you want to click it and go to a different page
[15:41:51] <zulax> looking for some concept regarding making google like auto suggest while typing something
[15:42:02] <em0vskangoura> Is there any jQuery function to check if javascript is enabled at client's side ? I didnt find.
[15:42:10] <zulax> what kind of html element is that? its not a combo box or multiselect
[15:42:47] <zulax> well it could be multiselect of given width and height, is it?
[15:47:03] <rpg32> anybody know of a good way to move the cursor in a contenteditable div? I have been trying to trigger a keypress event for the left arrow key but that doens't seem to work...
[15:49:06] <rpg32> http://jsfiddle.net/Rhrbj/
[15:53:06] <gnarf> rpg32: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181700/set-cursor-position-on-contenteditable-div
[15:53:27] <gnarf> rpg32: first google result "change cursor selection position contentEditable"
[15:56:24] <gpk_> i have a .each inside of another .each, i want to call the 'i' of the parent .each from inside the child, is this possible without me setting up my own counter?
[15:56:37] <Eviltwin> gpk_: Show code
[15:56:42] <Eviltwin> pastebin or jsFiddle or something
[15:56:44] <gpk_> k let me make a paste
[15:57:07] <gnarf> rpg32: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.mask.js#L73-109 -- some code I wrote for dealing with caret position on an <input> - may or may not be similar to the code for a contentEditable - feel free to test
[15:57:57] <rpg32> yea... most of the stuff that i saw used that createTextRange() function which did not seem to work for me
[15:58:00] <gnarf> gpk_: change the name of the index in the outer / inner loop to something other than "i" so both are in scope
[15:58:17] <gpk_> dude.. thank you i feel like a retard lol
[15:58:21] <gpk_> you are absolutely right lol
[15:58:33] <Eviltwin> That's what I was going to say but wanted to see specifics first
[15:58:35] <gnarf> rpg32: there are two methods, one for webkitish browsers, and one for IEish browsers
[15:58:42] <gpk_> thanks so much :)
[15:59:15] <gnarf> gpk_: cheers - simple problems are so satisfying to solve ;)
[16:00:15] <rpg32> do you know why i can't just send a leftarrow keypress trigger to the div?
[16:00:29] <gnarf> rpg32: yes - the browser doesn't listen to events, it publishes them
[16:00:57] <gnarf> when you trigger "click" or "submit" jQuery actually calls .click() or .submit() on the DOMElement
[16:01:16] <gnarf> there's no similar way to tell the browser you want to reproduce a "left arrow keypress"
[16:02:02] <rpg32> yet that is still able to trigger an event?
[16:02:30] <gnarf> rpg32: it triggers the event listeners, yes
[16:03:14] <gnarf> but - the browser doesn't listen
[16:03:18] <rpg32> i c
[16:03:20] <dabear> hm, doesn't strict mode in browsers require a function to always return a value?
[16:03:39] <rpg32> well that's annoying
[16:03:41] <rpg32> lol
[16:03:43] <dabear> atleast when sometimes it does, it must always return
[16:03:52] <dabear> if that was understandable
[16:16:54] <rpg32> is there something special that i need to include in order to use this createTextRange() function? it is not being recognized
[16:21:11] <rpg32> actually... in IE it says that the object doesn't support this property
[16:21:51] <rpg32> guess it doesn't work with divs...
[16:31:27] <coldhead> i feel like shit
[16:31:38] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me
[16:31:41] <z1000> any suggestion on best drag/drop uploader that works with IE ?
[16:31:55] <z1000> coldhead, ur lucky you can even 'feel'
[16:36:02] <Spinkzeit> Does anyone know how to make slideToggle less laggy for Firefox? runs perfect in Chrome
[16:36:12] <Spinkzeit> The div that is being hidden has CSS3 properties
[16:36:17] <Spinkzeit> I assume that's related
[16:37:57] <coldhead> ?g blue imp jquery upload @ z1000
[16:37:59] <bot-t> z1000, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload · GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[16:38:24] <coldhead> Spinkzeit: i would try removing those css3 properties to see if it makes any difference
[16:38:33] <coldhead> empirical observations > assumptions
[16:38:35] <Spinkzeit> coldhead: I just did and it didn't seemed to of O.o
[16:38:47] <Spinkzeit> It's still horribly laggy.
[16:39:00] <coldhead> opacity?
[16:39:11] <Spinkzeit> It's not set
[16:40:06] <Spinkzeit> http://pastebin.com/pZMZDjPv
[16:40:09] <Spinkzeit> That's the HTML/CSS
[16:43:29] <gnarf> Spinkzeit: sounds silly, but try adding a -moz-transform: translateZ(0); "magic bullet" for moving drawing calculations to the GPU - Your Mileage May Vary
[16:43:58] <gnarf> Spinkzeit: also - if you can get the demo of the issue running on jsFiddle.net - might make it easier for us to see the "issue"
[16:44:19] <Spinkzeit> gnarf: That made a noticeable improvement but still pretty laggy.
[16:44:20] <Spinkzeit> okay :)
[16:45:44] <gnarf> Spinkzeit: TBH - there may just be too many contained elements causing too many DOM reflows as the height is being animated
[16:45:56] <Spinkzeit> and Chrome just handles taht alot better?
[16:45:59] <Spinkzeit> *that
[16:46:02] <gnarf> perhaps
[16:47:46] <gnarf> the jQuery UI "Blind" effect might behave better - easy enough to implement on your own tho, you use a containing div that has overflow: hidden, and then animate its height to 0
[16:48:45] <Spinkzeit> gnarf: i'll give that a shot
[16:48:48] <Spinkzeit> Here's a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/NV2xv/
[16:48:54] <Spinkzeit> Although it's not laggy at all.
[16:49:22] <coldhead> eerie
[16:49:47] <gnarf> Spinkzeit: keep adding stuff from your page to the fiddle until you find the source of the lagginess then ;)
[16:50:38] <Spinkzeit> there's a boatload of HTML but this seems logical so okay :D
[17:04:53] <gnarf> Spinkzeit: id prolly start with all of the css
[17:05:24] <kenthree> anyone know how to disable hiding/summoning of toolbars in mobile? nowhere in the docs

[17:06:24] <nFFF> Spinkzeit, whats with the redundant embedded if statements :D
[17:06:27] <TedTed> ey
[17:06:43] <Spinkzeit> nFFF: was testing a theory that I was wrong about :)
[17:06:49] <TedTed> how can get the attr from <p style="text-align:right"> ?
[17:07:32] <Spinkzeit> .css('text-align') ?
[17:07:48] <BillyJoe> When I do $(".div-layer").fadeTo(0.4) and then $(".child-div").fadeTo(1.0), the child div is also semi-transparent. But I don't want it to be. How should I fix this?
[17:09:21] <gnarf> BillyJoe: if an element is contained, it will be just as "opaque" as its parent
[17:09:33] <gnarf> you can't "increase" the opacity of an element
[17:09:57] <TedTed> Spinkzeit: Thank YOU!!!
[17:10:16] <BillyJoe> gnarf, I see. Any idea about how to do instead?
[17:11:14] <gnarf> BillyJoe: fade out a "background" on a div i assume?
[17:12:16] <nFFF> TedTed, you may find ?attr more dynamic
[17:12:19] <BillyJoe> gnarf, I have a "popup" that adds a transparent black layer on the entire page, in order to show a white info-box in the center
[17:12:44] <nFFF> incase you don't know which css properties your element has within the attribute
[17:13:22] <ShawnRisk> how do I get colorbox to work, I have this all correct in, but nothing is showing up in the colorbox when I click the link. Â How come?
[17:13:35] <nFFF> ?attr @ TedTed
[17:13:37] <bot-t> TedTed, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:14:21] <TedTed> not working with attr :X
[17:14:30] <TedTed> :/
[17:14:48] <nFFF> sec
[17:15:09] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/h3CyU/
[17:15:48] <nFFF> How where you using it?
[17:15:57] <nFFF> you need attr('style');
[17:16:32] <gnarf> BillyJoe: yeah, don't put the "opaque" thing being the "container" --- http://jsfiddle.net/uFatU/
[17:17:47] <BillyJoe> gnarf thx!
[17:18:42] <TedTed> How to remove some attribute from style? like removing text-align from <p style="text-align"> ?
[17:19:33] <gnarf> TedTed: DOMElement.style.textAlign = '';
[17:19:45] <nFFF> TedTed, if you know exactly what property you wan the value for, you can use the CSS method
[17:19:56] <nFFF> if you simply want all the values you can use regex
[17:20:00] <gnarf> .css("text-align", "") prolly works too
[17:21:08] <TedTed> Worked!! Thank you all!
[17:21:14] <TedTed> Damm your good!! ;)
[17:24:02] <thomedy> heres a weird question... i have a jquery thing going on where i am clicking an image it html()'s the url to the image and then prints it somewhere else in a larger form.... well im now adding the product description in a variable called description i can console.log description but not print it on the page... "whhhhaaaaauuuuuu?"
[17:25:26] <Rushing> first thing to check is that you're trying to insert the description in a valid element
[17:25:50] <ShawnRisk> how do I get colorbox to work, I have this all correct in, but nothing is showing up in the colorbox when I click the link. Â How come?
[17:26:02] <Rushing> ieâ¦. var $stuff = $(".stuff"); if($stuff.length){ $stuff.append(description) }
[17:27:00] <thomedy> rushing i have the jsfiddle if you wouldn'tmind
[17:28:38] <thomedy> oh thank you rushing thats a great validator
[17:30:27] <Rushing> np
[17:30:57] <thomedy> the thing is that i m not filling an existing divi have .after(description) which i have recently changed to .append(description)
[17:31:07] <thomedy> sorry
[17:31:12] <thomedy> not quite accurate
[17:31:23] <TedTed> is there any way to clear a textfield when clicked?
[17:31:35] <thomedy> i have append('<div>' + description + '</div>');
[17:36:51] <bahodir> if I have a select already selected like so: $("#myselect"), how do I get an option by some value like in $('#myselect option[value="somevalue"]')
[17:37:36] <thomedy> i figured out my problem...
[17:37:42] <Es0teric> how do i target a backgroundcolor & border for animation toggle on click?
[17:38:02] <thomedy> nothing.. since the field im absorbing has no text iw asn't thinking straight its coming acros as markup so its not printing it turns into a div
[17:38:04] <thomedy> anyway
[17:38:07] <thomedy> thats it
[17:38:59] <TedTed> is there any way to clear a textfield when clicked?
[17:43:30] <Spinkzeit> TedTed: $('textarea').val('')
[17:43:40] <Es0teric> TedTed, you can do html5 and set a placeholder for the textfield, that works too
[17:43:47] <Spinkzeit> well actually it's $('textarea').click(function(){ $(this).val(''); });
[17:43:51] <Spinkzeit> or that
[17:43:56] <TedTed> how? the textfield is an input :X
[17:44:10] <Spinkzeit> TedTed: jQuery treats it as an input basically
[17:44:22] <Spinkzeit> (afaik)
[17:44:31] <Spinkzeit> if that doesn't work try .text('')
[17:44:47] <Es0teric> TedTed -> $('#idofinput or input[name"nameofinput"]').click(function(){ $(this).val(''); });
[17:46:03] <Es0teric> now, how do i toggle backgroundcolor and border on/off?
[17:46:59] <TedTed> Thank you guys!!
[17:47:02] <TedTed> YOU ROCK!!!!!
[17:47:09] <TedTed> Worked like a charm!
[17:48:32] <Spinkzeit> Es0teric: something like http://pastebin.com/8AMBQMHd ?
[17:49:15] <Es0teric> Spinkzeit, you made your own function...
[17:49:32] <Spinkzeit> Es0teric: you didn't want a function?
[17:49:42] <Es0teric> but Spinkzeit i am talking about toggling the border AND background color
[17:49:45] <Es0teric> on/off
[17:49:59] <Es0teric> i tried to use .toggle();
[17:50:06] <Es0teric> controlling the animation
[17:50:36] <Es0teric> so, Spinkzeit it would be element.toggle(function() { $(this).animate({backgroundColor: '#000', border: '1px solid red'}); }function() { $(this).animate({backgroundColor: '#fff', border: '1px solid black'}); });
[17:50:54] <Es0teric> i missed a comma in there
[17:50:55] <Es0teric> >.>
[17:50:58] <Spinkzeit> lollerskates
[17:51:03] <Spinkzeit> I wasn't aware you could animate css
[17:51:07] <Spinkzeit> wait
[17:51:08] <Spinkzeit> That's retarded
[17:51:11] <Spinkzeit> of course you can
[17:51:45] <Es0teric> LOL
[17:51:59] <Es0teric> Spinkzeit that works but the problem is that it does the toggle on/on
[17:52:02] <Es0teric> not on/off
[17:52:10] <Spinkzeit> Es0teric: Wouldn't it be easier to use addClass/removeClass? http://jqueryui.com/demos/addClass/
[17:52:17] <Es0teric> i dont follow
[17:52:30] <Spinkzeit> You have a class
[17:52:34] <Spinkzeit> with the border/background
[17:52:38] <Spinkzeit> and the toggle you have remove/addClass
[17:52:42] <Spinkzeit> like that example
[17:53:51] <Es0teric> hmmm
[17:54:14] <Es0teric> i guess i can do that
[17:54:14] <Es0teric> lol
[17:54:50] <Spinkzeit> but also means you'll need jQuery UI loaded which is more kB loaded, both methods are possible
[17:55:19] <Es0teric> i have jquery ui loaded.. i had to use .datepicker()
[17:55:25] <Es0teric> for something else
[17:56:12] <gnarf> Es0teric: you need UI Effects Core for animated addClass
[17:56:26] <Es0teric> i have jquery ui cor
[17:56:27] <Es0teric> e
[17:56:37] <gnarf> Es0teric: ui core != effects core
[17:56:51] <Es0teric> dude, i am losting jquery ui from google apis
[17:56:55] <Es0teric> *loading
[17:57:03] <Es0teric> so it has everything
[17:57:14] <gnarf> sure
[17:57:22] <gnarf> don't sound offended ;)
[17:57:27] <Es0teric> im not
[17:57:28] <Es0teric> lol
[17:57:29] <gnarf> just wanted to make sure you had effects core
[17:57:51] <gnarf> but yeah - .toggleClass( "name", duration ) totally works
[17:58:43] <gnarf> also - "border" properties are notoriously strange to animate - you might be better off just animating borderColor
[18:00:02] <Es0teric> gnarf what do you mean?
[18:00:06] <Es0teric> animating border color
[18:00:25] <gnarf> Es0teric: a) you need jQuery Color to do color animations (which is already included in UI)
[18:00:33] <Es0teric> i see
[18:00:35] <gnarf> Es0teric: b) you can't "animate" generated properties
[18:00:41] <gnarf> like border: "1px solid #000";
[18:00:51] <gnarf> you should be animating { borderColor: "#000" }
[18:01:04] <Es0teric> gnarf can i do a toggle class on a class? like.. $('.someclass').toggleClass()
[18:01:16] <gnarf> yeah if you have ui effects (which you do)
[18:01:19] <felixqc> little question about .tabs
[18:01:26] <Es0teric> ah alright cool cool
[18:01:45] <felixqc> when i load a tab in a modal... then close the modal... and reopen it, the .tabs are not done right (or not at all)
[18:03:53] <gnarf> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/hbMa2/
[18:04:47] <Es0teric> gnarf, but i am trying to toggle class on a class
[18:05:02] <gnarf> things can have two classes
[18:05:06] <gnarf> the code is identical
[18:05:30] <Es0teric> i see
[18:05:45] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/hbMa2/3/
[18:09:26] <Es0teric> gnarf yeah it worked for me
[18:09:27] <Es0teric> lol
[18:14:08] <Hawkee> how do I reference the object outside of a defined function?
[18:14:12] <Hawkee> this.parent?
[18:15:41] <Hawkee> no, it's not parent..
[18:16:19] <Hawkee> I've got an autocomplete and within a method I'm calling ajax and I need to call a function of the autocomplete from within the ajax success function
[18:23:50] <rpg32> hahaha sweet... i figured out an ugly hack for controlling the curser
[18:24:09] <rpg32> in the div
[18:24:52] <rpg32> a little buggy on IE though
[18:31:41] <Spinkzeit> Hawkee: example of the markup?
[18:32:01] <brianpWins> If you do a $.post(some url, {some: data}) and view the request in webkit inspector it sends "Form Data" instead of "Query String Parameters". How does it do this exactly ?
[18:32:59] <brianpWins> I'm trying to make a request with ruby on the server side and it always builds a query string and fails. the jquery post on the other hand works. the only difference i can find is that "Form Data" vs "Query String"
[18:36:19] <Hawkee> Spinkzeit, basically I'm doing an ajax call inside the autocomplete source option and I need to close() the autocomplete under certain circumstances within the ajax success call
[18:36:35] <Hawkee> when I return null the autocomplete remains open for some reason
[18:36:52] <Hawkee> but "this" refers to the ajax method, not the autocomplete
[18:37:04] <Hawkee> so I need to call one level up in the tree
[18:47:18] <coldhead> Hawkee: so at the level where you want the `this` do var that = this; and then in your inner-er scope you can refer to `that` where you want the other `this`
[18:47:37] <coldhead> inner-er? i hardly knew her!
[18:47:54] <Hawkee> so that.close()?
[18:48:17] <coldhead> maybe $(that).close()
[18:48:21] <coldhead> maybe just that.close()
[18:48:24] <coldhead> i don't know
[18:48:35] <coldhead> that should be the right this, is my point
[18:48:41] <coldhead> ?that that
[18:48:42] <bot-t> thank a lot yu deserve a great that that
[18:49:03] <Hawkee> I've never heard of "that"
[18:49:05] <coldhead> bot-t: always nice to work with you, thanks
[18:49:06] <Hawkee> doesn't seem to work
[18:49:08] <bot-t> coldhead, #8780 (events, preventDefault)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 11 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8780
[18:49:42] <coldhead> you don't have to call it that `that`, you can call it `anything`
[18:49:48] <coldhead> as thelonious monk would say
[18:49:58] <coldhead> the technique is sound
[18:49:59] <kenthree> is there any plan for animations to use css transitions?
[18:50:04] <coldhead> it's used everywhere in js
[18:50:22] <Hawkee> looks like I need to declare this as a var before making the async call
[18:50:29] <Hawkee> then refer to the cached variable
[18:51:06] <Hawkee> oh there it is, I missed that you told me to declare "that"
[18:51:08] <Hawkee> my bad
[18:51:53] <Hawkee> that did it, thank you
[18:52:18] <coldhead> hooray! (poolparty)
[18:52:36] * Hawkee jumps in
[19:01:30] <eddiemonge> who said they could do design work for me?
[19:12:40] <acidjazz> whats that sweet jquery move to find a click outside of a popped up window so you can close it
[19:12:53] <Hawkee> if you were typing a @mention and you didn't select it from the autocomplete would you expect it to work?
[19:13:10] <Hawkee> seems facebook requires you to select it from the dropdown
[19:13:15] <Hawkee> but Twitter doesn't
[19:13:48] <Hawkee> I guess if facebook does it that way it's acceptable
[19:17:39] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: $(document.body).on("click", function(e) {  if ( $(e.target).is( yourElement ) || if $(e.target).closest( yourelement).length ) {  closeYourPopup() });
[19:18:56] <eddiemonge> Hawkee: thats not good logic. just because X does/doesnt do something does/doesnt mean its the right thing
[19:19:22] <Hawkee> eddiemonge, yes that's why I'm asking :)
[19:19:45] <Hawkee> technically it makes sense to do it the way facebook does it
[19:19:59] <Hawkee> if you don't select from the autocomplete the ID won't be available
[19:20:14] <Hawkee> and you won't be able to save the status update with an ID rather than a username
[19:20:29] <Hawkee> especially when the username can change in the future
[19:20:53] <Hawkee> Twitter saves their tweets with plain text usernames
[19:21:15] <Hawkee> so the names can't have spaces
[19:21:23] <Hawkee> and if they change the @mentions are broken
[19:21:46] <eddiemonge> well twitter stores its user names as user names instead of ids
[19:22:16] <Hawkee> they must have an ID under the hood otherwise changing your name would clobber all your tweets
[19:22:49] <Hawkee> but I can see how its generally fine in the world of Twitter
[19:22:57] <Hawkee> since the usernames are so controlled
[19:23:55] <Hawkee> Google+ seems to do it the smartest
[19:24:17] <Hawkee> if you type the entire name out and there's only one choice left in the box it'll become selected
[19:24:48] <Hawkee> I don't know if I need to take it that far though..
[19:25:25] <Hawkee> if there's only one choice most people will press down and enter rather than finish typing it out
[19:27:49] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: evne better..
[19:27:55] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: tnx
[19:31:46] <coldhead> origami: art or craft?
[19:31:58] <eddiemonge> timesuck
[19:33:01] <Hawkee> craft, unless you're designing
[20:01:20] <raj> what's a FormData object?
[20:11:00] <Majicpanda> does jquery have a really reliable set interval type check?

[20:28:33] <JosephFerano> http://pastebin.com/wkJ8fRh0
[20:29:27] <JosephFerano> it's just a simple scroll to anchor script, but the offsets aren't working, I tried applying an offest like var contactOffset = jQuery('#ContactAnchor').offset().top - 100; but it's not consistent across browsers, got it to work on Chrome, then FF and IE do their own crazy thing
[20:31:03] <JosephFerano> can anybody help me out?
[21:01:39] <jaydev> help needed for impress.js
[21:02:35] <coldhead> CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC
[21:03:57] <jaydev> I want the impress demo into specific size container width 900px height 350px
[21:04:02] <jaydev> is is possible?
[21:04:09] <jaydev> is it possible?
[21:04:13] <coldhead> probably!
[21:04:19] <abjorn> coldhead: Nothin like a 10 hour work day...

[21:04:59] <jaydev> it is in my local machine
[21:04:59] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky no im just...busy
[21:05:00] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[21:05:08] <jaydev> lookin from here
[21:05:16] <cpaq> can you use jquery ui's animate({ color: "#FFF3B8" }, 1000); with text-shadow?
[21:05:24] <abjorn> coldhead: Tired. I'm glad they're dragging their feet on putting me on salary, with all the hours im working
[21:05:59] <jaydev> https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/
[21:06:10] <coldhead> cpaq: i don't think so
[21:06:19] <coldhead> cpaq: css3 transitions?
[21:06:35] <cpaq> coldhead, but ie doesn't support transitions
[21:06:49] <coldhead> cpaq: IE can eat a bag of dicks
[21:07:27] <coldhead> jaydev: it seems you can set the width and height in the css but all the css transforms might mess you up. if you're not comfortable tinkering to remove bits of code you don't want maybe try a different presentation lib
[21:07:30] <cpaq> coldhead, you don't code for ie?
[21:08:01] <coldhead> i make stuff accessible in IE, but you hold the web back if you treat everything as if it's that stupid
[21:08:08] <coldhead> as long as it works in IE, that's enough
[21:08:15] <coldhead> that's tim berners lee's case closed
[21:09:46] <cpaq> hmm
[21:10:29] <Majicpanda> there a way to make an ajax call to a php page and just get 1 function out of it?
[21:10:33] <Majicpanda> brain isnt on
[21:11:21] <coldhead> what do you mean "get 1 function out of it"?
[21:11:35] <Majicpanda> if you call a php page with 20 functions in it
[21:12:02] <Majicpanda> i need the ajax call to return 1 specific function.. i guess you'd have to pass a variable and if it makes that, call the function within the page?
[21:12:19] <cpaq> returns a string
[21:13:05] <coldhead> Majicpanda: yes, you might need like action=some_func_name and then a switch($_GET['action'])
[21:13:07] <Majicpanda> $.post("battle_execute.php", { "callFunction:" 'functionName'}, function(data) { ?
[21:13:11] <coldhead> to find the function to eval
[21:13:21] <coldhead> "callFunction":
[21:13:23] <LukeNukem> how can i search for a needle in a haystack using jquery?
[21:13:23] <coldhead> yes
[21:13:37] <Majicpanda> then on the php page, get the posted name and just do a switch
[21:13:41] <coldhead> and then test the value of $_GET['callFunction']
[21:13:43] <coldhead> right
[21:13:47] <LukeNukem> coldhead, any ideas?
[21:14:19] <coldhead> jquery is better at moving haystacks than it is at searching them
[21:14:34] <coldhead> can you just try moving the haystack until all that's left is a needle?

[21:22:10] <coldhead> no cpaq
[21:22:17] <coldhead> not unless you're doing something fancy
[21:22:30] <cpaq>   $(this).animate({ color: "#FFF3B8" }, 1000, function(){});
[21:22:34] <LukeNukem> cpaq, no
[21:22:38] <LukeNukem> that does not require jquery UI

[21:24:15] <LukeNukem> yes
[21:24:17] <cpaq> JosephFerano, I had a similar problem once, but then I moved my script to the ajax success block and it worked fine
[21:24:22] <coldhead> you should use regular expressions
[21:24:28] <coldhead> they are utterly the simplest way
[21:24:35] <coldhead> and this is exactly what they're designed for
[21:24:42] <LukeNukem> coldhead, .search eh?
[21:24:45] <coldhead> the only simpler way is to have someone else use a regular expression for you
[21:24:55] <JosephFerano> cpaq: the ajax success block? is that a joke or does that exist?
[21:24:57] <LukeNukem> coldhead, can you post an answer? i like to learn from existing code
[21:25:08] <cpaq> JosephFerano, are you using ajax?
[21:25:34] <JosephFerano> cpaq: no, just that one javascript I linked to
[21:25:56] <LukeNukem> JosephFerano, success block exists
[21:26:02] <LukeNukem> you mean the callback right
[21:26:18] <JosephFerano> LukeNukem: ok, cool
[21:26:43] <coldhead> LukeNukem: i don't use stack overflow, it takes away my freedoms
[21:26:45] <coldhead> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/Bke4U/
[21:26:51] <LukeNukem> under it $(".success_div").html(data)
[21:26:51] <JosephFerano> let me just get this out of the way, I'm a total jQuery noob, I haven't done web design in years, I got this gig and the client all of a sudden wants javascript, so now I'm stuck
[21:27:43] <LukeNukem> coldhead, i can use that to detect if there are any links in the input right ^.^
[21:27:59] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/ can someone fix his for me, very short code
[21:28:34] <cpaq> JosephFerano, you gonna do webdesign and you stuck on javascript, lol
[21:28:51] <LukeNukem> cpaq, lol?
[21:29:03] <LukeNukem> JosephFerano, isn't that css? i believe js is for web apps ^.^
[21:29:12] <JosephFerano> yeah, the client came out of nowhere with the request
[21:29:17] <Hawkee> coldhead, takes away your freedoms?
[21:29:41] <cesaro> JosephFerano: just pay someone else to do it
[21:29:58] <JosephFerano> I just need to fix this one script, and Im in the clear, already far enough
[21:30:05] <JosephFerano> http://pastebin.com/X8HcZMyK
[21:30:10] <Hawkee> JosephFerano, well they know what they're doing if they want javascript.. can't have a site without it by today's standards
[21:30:43] <cesaro> unless you want a good site
[21:31:10] <JosephFerano> it works fairly well, except in Chrome, where it takes a refresh for the offsets to work properly, if I load it normally, it doesn't work
[21:31:27] <JosephFerano> I found something on Chrome that talked about images not loading, but I don't really have any images so I don't see how that could be the issue
[21:31:41] <JosephFerano> it said to use .load instead of .ready, which just broke the thing
[21:32:10] <Driftwood> Hey does anyone know of a good tuorial that shows me how to use jquery and ajax to make additional form fields when a user selects from a drop down menu?
[21:32:19] <cpaq> JosephFerano, put an alert at various places one at a time to figure out where it is messing up
[21:32:58] <cpaq> JosephFerano, try to make a if chrome then delay
[21:33:52] <JosephFerano> cpaq: let me try the first thing then ill try that
[21:35:04] <JosephFerano> and out of the freaggin blue I can't reproduce the same error
[21:35:05] <JosephFerano> it works...
[21:35:46] <JosephFerano> great, reproduced it
[21:35:51] <cpaq> looks like you know plenty javascrpt
[21:36:25] <JosephFerano> I'm a programmer, just never touched js or jQuery
[21:36:42] <raj> why would iterating through a jquery object return an HTMLElement? http://jsfiddle.net/fCu2M/
[21:37:23] <JosephFerano> the if statement is working, so it has to be something else
[21:39:35] <JosephFerano> ok, fixed it, it's doing it wrong now but it's consistnetly wrong, so I just need to re-edit the values, I just had to change the thing to jQuery(window).load() instead of jQuery(document).ready()
[21:40:56] <cpaq> try with just $
[21:41:32] <JosephFerano> whats the difference?
[21:41:50] <cesaro> less characters.
[21:42:40] <JosephFerano> cool stuff
[21:42:47] <JosephFerano> I always hated that about php :)
[21:42:59] <JosephFerano> that dollar sign makes me cringe
[21:43:28] <plantian> too much money ?
[21:43:39] <coldhead> Y U NO CAPITALIST
[21:43:40] <JosephFerano> yeah, I hate php cause it's for rich people
[21:43:47] <coldhead> fewer* characters
[21:44:19] <JosephFerano> IT'S THE CORPORATIONS MAN
[21:44:44] <plantian> JosephFerano: I don't like the $ sign either, I prefer using "jQuery".
[21:45:03] <JosephFerano> plantian: yeah, tru dat
[21:48:15] <JosephFerano> alright, thanks for the help guys, later
[21:56:46] <Abnormalex> what are thsoe things called that hang out on the side of a page
[21:56:51] <Abnormalex> and slide in when you click themn
[21:56:58] <Abnormalex> usually say SUPPORT or something like that
[21:57:19] <cpaq> height: 'toggle' ?
[22:13:16] <cpaq> i can't seem to use the text-shadow property with jquery ui
[22:16:31] <letterpress> you still plugging away sam?
[22:17:41] <coldhead> http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/animate-textshadow/
[22:27:41] <cpaq> I am looking for some fancy text hover effects. like if the fonts would change color sliding in from left or right?
[22:30:04] <coldhead> cpaq: did you look at http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/animate-textshadow/ ?
[22:30:16] <coldhead> also try ?animateclass
[22:30:21] <cpaq> coldhead, thx
[22:30:24] <coldhead> thanks for nothing bot-t
[22:30:25] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:30:27] <coldhead> ?animateclass
[22:30:28] <bot-t> coldhead, UI/Effects/ClassTransitions - The jQuery UI effects core extends the base class API to be able to animate between two different classes. The following methods are changed. They now accept three additional parameters: speed , ea... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions
[22:32:11] <cpaq> coldhead, I tried that, I had a series of <h2>'s and selected them using $('h2'), you'd think $(this) would act on only one of them but it acted on all
[22:33:49] <cpaq> I did the same thing except with jquery ui's toggleClass
[22:35:37] <coldhead> cpaq: it would have acted on each of them in turn
[22:36:35] <cpaq> coldhead, I am gonna jsfiddle, maybe you can take a look if you got time
[22:37:24] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:38:05] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/9XnDX/
[22:40:14] <coldhead> i don't know UI well enough sorry cpaq
[22:40:28] <coldhead> you might have to wait for the US UI experts to wake up
[22:40:29] <cpaq> coldhead, thx anyay
[22:43:25] <cpaq> well, I am gonna try that plugin, but really, I wantd somethig more fancy than just a faded color change, I wanted the colour change to slide in from left to right or reverse
[22:44:22] <coldhead> cpaq: try googling for jquery text effects
[22:44:30] <coldhead> there are hundreds of stupid blog posts with that title
[22:44:38] <coldhead> and there are probably some decent effects in there
[22:47:29] <Majicpanda> theres no safe way to do a setinterval that queries your db is there? seems like a user could easily turn it into a ddos if they changed the js to every millisecond
[22:47:40] <cpaq> see the hover text effect: view-source:http://static.livedemo00.template-help.com/wt_38232/#!/splash  How do you do that?
[22:56:38] <Besogon> hi everybody. Does anyone hear something about a plugin which looks like menu on http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/html5-forms-pt1.html
[22:56:42] <Besogon> Figure 11
[22:57:34] <Besogon> May be if you have heard about something similar please answer. I'm tired of looking through plugins
[23:05:08] <rabbi1> I am trying to implement accordion for a fieldset, according to example in jqueryui i have <legend> in place of <h3> and <ul> in place of <div>. How can i get the result ? as of now, its not hiding the <ul> but instead its hiding/ showing another <fieldset>
[23:06:49] <rabbi1> my structure is <div id="accordion"><fieldset><legend><a href="#">Section1</a></legend><ul></ul></fieldset><fieldset><legend><a href="#">Section2</a></legend><ul></ul></fieldset></div>
[23:12:01] <Cork> rabbi1: can't say i've seen any docs(and can't find now) that states that accordion supports using fieldsets
[23:12:49] <rabbi1> Cork: i just had a look at the documents, i had to set the header: legend... i have done it but still the result is same, and how can i replace the default <div> to <ul> ?
[23:14:10] <Cork> rabbi1: as far as i can find the structure for accordion is <div><h3/><div/>...</div>
[23:14:11] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[23:14:46] <Cork> and by that i mean, thats how it works, "deal with it"
[23:15:15] <rabbi1> yeah that's correct, but i don want it specifically for a <div> or <h3> element i have replace the <h3> with <legend> and also have set the header:legend as per the documtation
[23:15:30] <codezombie> I've got an interesting problem... My web app allows the user to view thier images, and edit those images. Once the edit has been accepted by the user, an ajax request is sent to the server, which then re-processes the image. However, these images have to be cached. Is there a way, other than specifying a timestamp on the image url, to force the browser to reload that image, and re-cache?
[23:16:12] <codezombie> the timestamp works to reload the new version, but next view without the timestamp causes the old cached version to be reloaded
[23:17:01] <Cork> codezombie: no browser cache is built from the url referencing them
[23:17:20] <Cork> either you need a version after the url or a timestamp
[23:17:49] <codezombie> seems that there should be some way to handle a situation like this, without having never caching the image
[23:18:20] <Cork> codezombie: why is there a problem with adding the string?
[23:19:11] <codezombie> Cork, because the timestamp 1) if used all the time, doesn't cache the image... 2) if only used after the edit, doesn't actually clear the cache, it just caches a new url with a timestamp
[23:19:33] <codezombie> and actually, I think I just came up with an answer
[23:20:07] <codezombie> using my image records updated_at timestamp in the url, I can cache the image url, and only get a new one when the record is updated.
[23:20:20] * Cork nods
[23:20:27] <Cork> thats how its usually done
[23:20:52] <codezombie> I was trying to use the timestamp as a kindof global refresh, but obviously was the wrong approach
[23:21:24] <codezombie> sometimes I surprise myself with how little I actually see the resolution in front of my face
[23:21:50] <spaceninja> hello, trying to do some jquery, it looks ok, but it doesn't work :( http://dpaste.com/716229/
[23:22:50] <Cork> spaceninja: is the structure <elm class="gallery_section"><img><img><img></elm>
[23:23:01] <Cork> or do you have another element inbetween?
[23:23:14] <spaceninja> no other elements
[23:23:32] <spaceninja> it's like the way you typed it, <div class="gallery_section"
[23:24:26] <Cork> then ya, that looks correct
[23:25:16] <Cork> never been found of wrap* my self, its always been bugby for me
[23:28:06] <spaceninja> Tried to test if the the thing worked with addClass instead of wrappAll $(this).children('img').addClass('gallery_source');
[23:28:40] <spaceninja> And it doesn't, I'm generating trough a jinja templating script
[23:28:52] <spaceninja> generating the <img>
[23:28:56] <Cork> do you have a link?
[23:29:28] <spaceninja> nope, haven't hosted it
[23:30:07] <Cork> put a breakpoint in the loop and check what the different functions return
[23:30:12] <Cork> and make sure its what you expect
[23:36:04] <ram_> do u tell me the baasic of jquery

[23:37:18] <Soothsayer> I need to translate this flash animation ( madhuridixit-nene.com ) when you roll over the menu options at the bottom into pure HTML5/CSS3/jQuery/JavaScript. What libraries would you recommend that I make best use of to execute such a task?
[23:38:39] <Soothsayer> here's a clickable version of the link http://madhuridixit-nene.com  (requires flash)
[23:38:47] <mathi> hello
[23:38:53] <mathi> anybody
[23:38:59] <spaceninja> Cork: I think it has something to do with the <div class="gallery_section"> being generated by a script. I can add a css rule to it, for example the background-color to be red. That works, but I can't addClass('someclass') to it.
[23:39:42] <mathi> .split('@@') is not working in 1.7 version pls any suggestions
[23:39:47] <Cork> spaceninja: na, theres not a limitation like that
[23:40:33] <mathi> anybody
[23:40:55] <Nomikos> is split() a jquery function?
[23:41:03] <systemfault> It's pure JS afaik.
[23:41:13] <mathi> error shows .split is not a function
[23:41:19] <Nomikos> right
[23:41:19] <coldhead> ?eval 'lol@@aids@@omg@@gypsies'.split('@@');
[23:41:21] <bot-t> coldhead: ["lol", "aids", "omg", "gypsies"]
[23:41:34] <Nomikos> mathi: use it on a string, not on a jquery object
[23:42:20] <mathi> already its working fine today  i update the jquery version 1.7 then only its show error
[23:42:56] <Nomikos> that's nice. It's still a Javascript string method, not a jQuery object method
[23:43:18] <mathi> oh fine
[23:43:46] <Nomikos> maybe toString() helps?
[23:43:51] <Nomikos> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980245/jquery-cant-use-split-function
[23:44:16] <mathi> function(objJson) { 	var result = objJson.split('@@'); this is my code any solution
[23:44:33] <Nomikos> what is objJson?
[23:44:35] <brianpWins> whats the difference between $.post('/this/url', {foo: 'bar'}) and $.post('/this/url?foo=bar'); ?
[23:44:45] <mathi> nomi thats json object
[23:44:48] <Nomikos> brianpWins: Post vs Get parameters
[23:45:11] <Nomikos> mathi: is it a string?
[23:45:25] <mathi> no nomikos it's a object
[23:45:40] <brianpWins> Nomikos: I have a library thats trying to make post request but putting all the data in a query string while it's doing it =S
[23:46:03] <systemfault> brianpWins: Eww, what a bad API then
[23:46:12] <systemfault> brianpWins: (I know it's not your fault)
[23:46:40] <brianpWins> it's weird though cause it's the defacto lib for http. I must have something configured wrong
[23:46:41] <Nomikos> mathi: then you can not use a string function on it. if the object contains a string, specify that first using a property name
[23:46:55] <Nomikos> objJson.myStringName.split('@@')
[23:47:42] <mathi> nomikos its already working fine in jquery 1.2.6
[23:48:12] <Nomikos> then jQuery 1.2.6 was likely broken :-p or converted the object to string for you
[23:48:13] <mathi> hole function is inside onready
[23:49:03] <Nomikos> look, it's an object. you can't split objects with string methods, just like you can't do "foobar" - 5 = ..
[23:49:37] <systemfault> Nomikos: You can ;)
[23:49:39] <mathi> ok lets try for string thank you nomikos
[23:49:40] * systemfault flees.
[23:50:09] <Nomikos> systemfault: well, they try here :-p https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[23:50:24] <systemfault> I've seen that :P
[23:50:39] * Nomikos can watch that again and again
[23:54:33] <mathi> nomi its working fine now this syntax obj.toString().split('@@')
[23:54:39] <mathi> thank you all
[23:54:46] <Nomikos> cool
[23:54:54] <mathi> thank you nomi
[23:55:29] <Nomikos> I'm .. keep an eye on that code though
[23:55:37] <Nomikos> Make sure it does what it's supposed to :)
[23:56:07] <mathi> ok
[23:56:09] <systemfault> guesscoding can only gets you so far...
[23:56:21] <Nomikos> var x = {"foo":"bar"}; x.toString(); // "[object Object]"
[23:56:37] <mathi> lol
[23:56:43] <mindis|wurk> i wonder what it means when running execcommand results in an error like this: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHTMLDocument.execCommand since googling it doesn't really result in anything useful
[23:57:09] <mathi> nomi not get
[23:58:46] <mathi> OMG thats return without error but its null
