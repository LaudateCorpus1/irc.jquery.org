[00:23:26] <DragonPunch> how do you add extra data to DropZone?
[00:28:32] <se_busca_ayuda> how do I make an object inherit the methods from autocomplete?
[00:41:11] <se_busca_ayuda> how can i use jQuery to select a class?
[00:56:10] <guzzlefry> se_busca_ayuda: That's covered in any basic jQuery tutorial.
[00:56:22] <se_busca_ayuda> found it! thanks
[02:31:12] <krasimir> .
[02:31:16] <krasimir> hi all , http://pastebin.com/uzA6RyGw how do I get this when calling the funcion inline ?
[02:31:18] <krasimir> the code doesn;t work because this is undefined
[02:43:15] <se_busca_ayuda> which DOM event occurs when you select an option from an autocomplete menu?
[03:11:11] <decx> autoselect fires its own events
[03:11:23] <decx> in this case quite literally select
[03:11:47] <decx> or from outside the autocomplete method 'autocompleteselect'
[03:28:03] <se_busca_ayuda> thank you decx
[04:27:16] <se_busca_ayuda> does the autocomplete.appendTo option require Element names or can i use a class?
[04:29:04] <se_busca_ayuda> more specifically, does “appendTo” do what I think it does which is move the dropdown menu to another element?
[04:42:33] <MeowZedong> hi guys, I am going through a jQuery book (Pro jQuery 2 which I bought here in Asia) and it talks about properties and attributes. What’s the difference between attributes and property? Is attribute what jQuery uses and property what DOM HTMLElement uses?
[04:42:43] <MeowZedong> thanks for any clarification
[04:43:18] <decx> attributes are in your html markup <tag attribute="value">
[04:43:44] <decx> these get parsed by your browser and build the dom
[04:43:50] <decx> where you have elements with properties
[04:46:10] <decx> there was a good article on that somewhere
[04:46:44] <decx> when in doubt mdn https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
[04:56:45] <MeowZedong> Hey guys I am learning the almost latest ASP.NET MVC and I want to understand how Web API will play into my everyday jQuery work. If I am building AJAX-intensive jQuery websites, that uses a lot of GET and POST but not necessary DELETE and PUT, can I still use Web API? Every documentation I see for Web API seems to add the PUT and DELETE HTTP verbage :-(
[05:02:31] <MeowZedong> Another thing I noticed in the jQuery book is that it doesn’t list textboxes in its chapters on jQuery UI, is there a jQuery UI equivalent of textboxes?
[05:42:48] <Cyclohexane> I'm using $.post in 1.10.2 and trying to catch errors e.g. error 500 using .fail() but it's throwing TypeError: (intermediate value).fail is not a function - any idea why?
[05:45:19] <Cyclohexane> oh ok, seems to work now xD
[05:47:13] <Cyclohexane> I chained it in the wrong place
[05:55:37] <shockwave> I can appended data to an element without having to refresh, but once refreshed it's gone. Is there a way to permanently appended the data?
[05:56:02] <MeowZedong> yes
[05:56:14] <MeowZedong> HTML 5 gives you a way to write to the user’s hard drive
[05:58:10] <Skizu> Hey I'm using the animated effect on a div which contains a div and a triangle at the bottom
[05:58:22] <shockwave> MeowZedong: was that directed to me?
[05:58:24] <Skizu> I'm using .slideDown() and only the div slides down
[05:58:36] <MeowZedong> shockwave: yes
[05:59:12] <shockwave> MeowZedong: are you being sarcastic?
[06:00:33] <MeowZedong> shockwave: so you come into this channel, you ask, you get an answer, and now you are being snide at the person helping you?
[06:00:45] <MeowZedong> why do i even bother… *sigh*
[06:01:19] <hugo_moss> guys pls no fighting
[06:01:48] <shockwave> MeowZedong: Tone is difficult to determine through text. Your response seems far fetched.
[06:03:52] <MeowZedong> if you don’t want to use or depend on HTML 5, don’t take it out on me
[06:03:58] <MeowZedong> i didn’t design HTML 5
[06:04:13] <MeowZedong> as long as we have that understanding i am cool
[06:04:20] <hugo_moss> guys pls be good boys ok
[06:04:24] <shockwave> MeowZedong: why are you mad?
[06:04:47] <Skizu> Can someone help me as to why the arrow isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/f78nz8ep/
[06:06:28] <hugo_moss> the click me works skizu
[06:06:38] <hugo_moss> but you have no event handler bound to the arro
[06:06:40] <Skizu> The arrow doesn't scroll down too
[06:06:50] <Skizu> But the arrow is within #contact-me
[06:07:04] <hugo_moss> so you want it to scroll down when you click the arrow
[06:07:13] <hugo_moss> or just the click me
[06:07:27] <Skizu> When you click the clickme all should scroll down
[06:08:09] <Skizu> hugo_moss: http://jsfiddle.net/f78nz8ep/2/
[06:08:17] <Skizu> So this would be kind of how it is by default
[06:10:11] <hugo_moss> the arrow is not inside the div contact-me
[06:10:47] <Skizu> What
[06:10:50] <Skizu> Did I derp
[06:11:04] <Skizu> Yes it is?!
[06:11:37] <hugo_moss> oops i was wrong
[06:11:38] <hugo_moss> it is
[06:11:45] <hugo_moss> hmm but it has a height of 0px
[06:11:48] <hugo_moss> i wonder if thats why
[06:12:12] <Skizu> Hmm yeah but I want it to transition the height of the containing thing
[06:12:31] <hugo_moss> the height of the div that contains the arrow has a height of 0 px
[06:12:58] <Skizu> So how do I sort this :/?
[06:13:21] <Skizu> It's all in padding
[06:13:27] <Skizu> So can I add an animation for the padding :D?
[06:14:56] <hugo_moss> ok i think its because of the position absolute
[06:15:06] <hugo_moss> the arrow is absolute positioned
[06:15:13] <Skizu> So how do i do
[06:15:23] <hugo_moss> ok
[06:15:24] <hugo_moss> i got it
[06:15:27] <hugo_moss> remove position absolute
[06:15:32] <Skizu> Is that it?
[06:15:34] <hugo_moss> yup
[06:15:37] <hugo_moss> its working for me
[06:15:50] <hugo_moss> remove position absolute from the arrow
[06:17:33] <Skizu> The reason I had that is because if there's another thing below like it
[06:17:36] <Skizu> Then it'll not work
[06:17:37] <Skizu> I'll show
[06:18:51] <Skizu> hugo_moss: http://jsfiddle.net/f78nz8ep/3/ see this
[06:19:02] <Skizu> I want the arrow to be ontop of the box below you know
[06:19:09] <GoSox> i'm confused. I know that to bind events to 'future' elements, we have to use the .on( ) event handler. But if we simply want to manipulate DOM elements that are new, can we do that normally just as we would 'original' elements?
[06:19:36] <GoSox> like, if i watned to get the value of an input i just created, I can immediately get $("#input_id").val( )
[06:32:42] * hellier waves
[06:36:59] <hellier> I have this: $(this).parents('.row').clone(); - how can I edit this so it clones the .row element as well?
[06:37:05] <hellier> currently it grabs everything inside the .row element
[06:52:20] <cyberorganism> How do I permanently append data to an html element without refreshing the page in order for it to appear?
[06:52:42] <GoSox> .appent() and it should appear instanatly
[06:52:50] <arthurvr> append() actually lol
[06:52:59] <arthurvr> `api append @ cyberorganism
[06:52:59] <b-ot> cyberorganism: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:53:25] <cyberorganism> is that different than .html()?
[06:53:31] <hellier> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29317905/jquery-cloning-parent-element :P
[06:53:39] <hellier> this is driving me insane. such a simple problem
[06:53:40] <GoSox> .html() doesn't append, it replaced the entire contents
[06:53:49] <arthurvr> ^ exactly
[06:53:57] <GoSox> replaces*
[06:54:03] <cyberorganism> it replaced and appends though right?
[06:54:34] <GoSox> i don't understand that question
[06:54:39] <arthurvr> It replaces all in it. Append adds nodes to the end.
[06:55:50] <cyberorganism> If I have an h1 and I do: $('selector').html("asdf"), how is that different than $('selector').append("asdf")....
[06:56:10] <GoSox> append adds to whatever is already there, html replaces what is there
[06:56:44] <GoSox> not to be a dick but do you not know what the word append means?
[06:56:45] <cyberorganism> Okay, there is nothing there to begin with meaning they are in effect doing the same thing in my instance, so I believe I will still have the problem
[06:57:29] <zhan_> what jquery should i use to hide a css element, until a dropdown is selected, after which i display it through ID
[06:57:49] <cyberorganism> GoSox: by that logic I should expect .html() not to append anything because of a literal interpretation of the arbitrary word associated with the method to convey it's action
[06:58:15] <GoSox> but html doesn't appent
[06:58:17] <GoSox> append*
[06:58:50] <Inspiral> does anyone know why this works for the first two directions but fails on the last two? https://jsfiddle.net/QmmSu/
[06:58:58] <decx> it can technically GoSox
[06:59:07] <cyberorganism> so both add text but one is just "replacing" and the other is appending?
[06:59:38] <Inspiral> sorry, i meant http://jsfiddle.net/QmmSu/8/
[06:59:45] <GoSox> this conversation is going in awesome circles, just post a jsfiddle of your problem and we can see whats wrong
[07:01:09] <cyberorganism> GoSox: I dont think it's going in circles, I just think there is a lack of clarity regarding exactly what .html() does differently than append assuming the element's "innerhtml" is empty to begin with...
[07:01:35] <GoSox> well yeah, if the element is empty than they will both have the exact same result
[07:02:28] <cyberorganism> GoSox: so exactly opposite of what you said to begin with
[07:02:37] <GoSox> no not at all
[07:02:55] <GoSox> but i've lost interest in this conversation
[07:03:10] <cyberorganism> GoSox: Okay, thanks for the helP!
[07:03:25] <zhan_> what jquery should i use to hide a css element, until a dropdown is selected, after which i display it through ID
[07:03:40] <Inspiral> zhan_: .hide()
[07:03:50] <decx> there are several problems Inspiral
[07:04:02] <Inspiral> ok...
[07:04:05] <decx> each will just fire all animates at roughly the same time
[07:04:09] <zhan_> im really new to this, inspiral, could you spell it out
[07:04:14] <decx> and you override left and right
[07:04:26] <decx> and top/bottom
[07:04:39] <Inspiral> im guessing its not as simple as .delay() ?
[07:04:50] <Inspiral> zhan_: jQuery('.class').hide();
[07:05:02] <decx> look at the end, your element has the following inline style left: 100px; top: 100px; right: 100px; bottom: 100px;
[07:05:21] <Inspiral> ah wow
[07:05:30] <decx> you're better off using css3 animation keyframes
[07:06:44] <Inspiral> is animation: supported on the standard browsers?
[07:07:20] <decx> good enough
[07:07:38] <Inspiral> ill have a try with that
[07:07:40] <Inspiral> cheers
[07:14:32] <cgeo> is it performant to first check if a DOM element exists before attaching an event or modifying something?
[07:14:51] <cgeo> eg. if $element.length
[07:20:07] <zhan_> how do i unhide elemnt going off it's id
[07:20:27] <arthurvr> $(‘#yourId’).show() you mean?
[07:21:50] <arthurvr> zhan_: demo: http://jsbin.com/rejoredore/1/edit?js,output
[07:22:05] <zhan_> im sorry, i mean im hiding class 'form', once user select dropdown using rails select ['title', 1], how do i bind id to that index
[07:22:17] <arthurvr> oh that way
[07:22:34] <arthurvr> a fiddle would be nice.
[07:22:45] <arthurvr> cgeo: yea
[07:23:15] <zhan_> <%= select(:corporation, :ops_policy, ([['Ops Policy', 1],
[07:23:21] <arthurvr> cgeo: you can read about it in http://learn.jquery.com/performance/dont-act-on-absent-elements/.
[07:23:50] <arthurvr> !paste @ zhan_
[07:23:50] <b-ot> zhan_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:24:11] <cgeo> arthurvr: thanks! I'm trying to optimize my js on wee mobile devices
[07:24:44] <arthurvr> cgeo: Simple suggestion but look at the really important things first. This are generally micro improvements.
[07:25:12] <arthurvr> Though every millisecond helps!
[07:25:18] <zhan_> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=TKL4hQmzL1
[07:25:56] <arthurvr> That’s a paste not a testcase :) We need something to fiddle around in that actually works ;)
[07:26:17] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions last paragraph
[07:27:14] <zhan_> does it work with rails?
[07:27:23] <zhan_> cuz i don't remember html anymore
[07:27:36] <zhan_> and it better work with rials
[07:27:45] <arthurvr> Nope it doesn’t
[07:30:46] <cgeo> @arthurvr one of the biggest performance issues I have seems to be touchstart events confusing device zoom taps. Any suggestion on how to deal with that without disabling userscaling
[07:31:36] <cgeo> appears that the older OSs get really confused and have a mega delay
[07:32:40] <arthurvr> With older OSs you mean? I never experienced a huge delay except the normal but terrible slowness of some devices.
[07:33:54] <cgeo> i keep an old iphone 3Gs running iOS 5 as my base
[07:36:01] <arthurvr> Yeah that’s old to say the least :D Might be true, no experience with it.
[07:37:26] <hey> hey
[07:37:30] <arthurvr> hey hey
[07:37:34] <cgeo> only adding touch events if DOM elements exist and or certain classes exists is already making big improvements
[07:38:28] <arthurvr> cgeo: Yeah, that might be true. I was just saying that it does not make much sense when doing that for every method you call.
[07:39:52] <Guest45452> I some team guy around to help me with my google summer of code proposal?
[07:39:59] <Guest45452> I need help on the timeline part
[07:40:59] <Guest45452> also should the description be around the project or around the foundation
[07:41:06] <arthurvr> Hey Guest45452! I’m a team member and would love to help you out. Can we move to #jquery-dev?
[07:41:34] <arthurvr> This channel is meant for support
[07:41:52] <Guest45452> awesome thanks arthurvr
[07:41:53] <cgeo> @arthurvr whats special about #jquery-dev?
[07:42:15] <arthurvr> It is meant for development of jQuery project, this channel is for support on using jQuery.
[07:42:23] <arthurvr> Guest45452: Thanks
[07:42:28] <cgeo> ah k
[07:42:47] <arthurvr> cgeo: fyi we have a few other channels as well :) irc.jquery.com
[07:45:58] <willyman> Hey everybody I have a question about performance anyone who knows?
[07:46:26] <arthurvr> We can always try, willyman! Shoot!
[07:46:29] <arthurvr> !ask
[07:46:29] <b-ot> arthurvr: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:46:50] <cgeo> @arthurvr cool ps the jQuery Docs are great!
[07:46:50] <willyman> okay so
[07:47:26] <zhan_> how do i unhide division through ID, by binding the ID to dropdown select?
[07:47:27] <zhan_> in rails
[07:48:24] <arthurvr> zhan_: Don’t ask things twice in an half of an hour :) Maybe try it again tomorrow or this evening.
[07:49:04] <willyman> what's so bad about using attribute selectors unquoted. Everybody tells me not to use it like that but I like the syntax
[07:49:09] <arthurvr> lemme explain
[07:50:17] <arthurvr> ah grr don’t have the time anymore
[07:50:19] <arthurvr> sorry
[07:50:22] <arthurvr> anyone else?
[07:51:38] <willyman> ill do like zhan_ and come back later thanks
[07:52:22] <NinjaBanjo> \o
[08:03:24] <cgeo> is there another/better/faster way to listen for an element class change than using trigger to create your own event when the class changes and then listening for that?
[08:05:27] <marleen> <cgeo> I do'nt think there is
[08:06:06] <marleen> if you write your code the right way angular takes care of it
[08:07:15] <cgeo> marleen: have yet to look at angular. SOmething for a rainy month
[08:07:36] <marleen> you should of course not put angular in a page for that
[08:07:48] <cgeo> ha of course
[08:08:54] <cgeo> i just have a plugin thats changing a classname and would prefer not to modify the plugin which doesnt include a trigger
[08:09:27] <cgeo> found a SO post about overriding addClass to include a trigger
[08:17:07] <NinjaBanjo> cgeo: object.observe
[08:18:41] <arthurvr> NinjaBanjo: It’s better to avoid object.observe for now
[08:18:43] <arthurvr> http://caniuse.com/#search=object.observe
[08:18:49] <arthurvr> pretty much totally red
[08:18:59] <NinjaBanjo> arthurvr: he asked if there was a better way, there is
[08:19:06] <NinjaBanjo> didn't ask for any support requiremenets
[08:19:10] <NinjaBanjo> it's functional in chrome and ff
[08:19:52] <arthurvr> NinjaBanjo: He said he was buillding a mobile thingy a half hour ago :)
[08:20:00] <NinjaBanjo> whoops
[08:20:12] <arthurvr> :D
[08:20:28] <arthurvr> But you’re totally right about object.observe being the future!
[08:20:41] <arthurvr> It’s awesome.
[08:21:45] <cgeo> @NinjaBanjo i got so excited until it failed and i then read only ECMADcript 7 (maybe)
[08:21:56] <cgeo> but cool to know
[08:22:16] <arthurvr> yeah it’s a nice thingy huh
[08:22:38] <arthurvr> But I guess we’ll have to wait another few years guys :)
[08:23:21] <arthurvr> It’s sort of shimmable though
[08:23:24] <NinjaBanjo> cgeo: arthurvr es6 won't even be fully adopted by 2016
[08:23:38] <NinjaBanjo> whoops, idnd;t mean to hilight anyone
[08:23:54] <arthurvr> in browsers not, no.
[08:24:05] <arthurvr> Though you can freakin’ use es6 perfectly
[08:24:20] <NinjaBanjo> https://github.com/KapIT/observe-shim
[08:24:20] <arthurvr> yay for http://babeljs.io/
[08:24:29] <NinjaBanjo> ^^ ++
[08:24:31] <arthurvr> Nah don’t use that one.
[08:25:07] <arthurvr> https://github.com/polymer/observe-js is built by the polymer team and has its adventages
[08:31:07] <cgeo> @arthurvr good to know for the shim but probably adds more overhead than just overriding addClass
[08:31:30] <ahop> Hi! I have <a id="deletebtn" action="delete">...</a>
[08:31:33] <arthurvr> Yes. That’s why I said to not use a polyfill and avoid it.
[08:31:49] <arthurvr> ahop: what would you like to do with that button?
[08:31:49] <ahop> Sorry once again
[08:32:11] <ahop> <a class="mybtn" action="delete">...</a>  <a class="mybtn" action="makeprivate">...</a>
[08:32:36] <ahop> $('.mybtn').click(function (e) {   // how to know here which button I am with ?
[08:32:59] <arthurvr> Inside of the handler this refers to the right one.
[08:33:08] <ahop> in a $('.mybtn').click(function (e) {    how to make select/case  between the different so-called "action" attributes
[08:33:17] <arthurvr> let me fiddle
[08:33:27] <ahop> k
[08:34:15] <arthurvr> 5 minutes
[08:35:09] <ahop> oh should I $('.mybtn').click(function (e) {  console.log($(this).attr('action')); ...
[08:36:56] <arthurvr> ahop: here you go sir http://jsbin.com/qiwonukove/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:37:13] <arthurvr> seems like you figured it out on your own
[08:37:15] <arthurvr> congrats!
[08:37:51] <hellier> I'm running an each on a .class, and wanting to find if it's the last: http://jsbin.com/gezesorotu/1/edit?html,js,console - anyway to have this working?
[08:39:06] <arthurvr> hellier: you want to do this I think? http://jsbin.com/bonotejiba/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[08:39:25] <arthurvr> to only log on the last use :last
[08:39:50] <hellier> thanks arthurvr
[08:40:04] <hellier> aye, i fogort to change it back to :last in the example
[08:40:57] <arthurvr> hellier: you’re welcome
[08:42:19] <arthurvr> active channel today
[08:43:31] <ahop> thx arthurvr !
[08:43:40] <ahop> Do you think this is a good system : http://jsbin.com/bikuroqiba/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:44:32] <arthurvr> ahop: Looks good
[08:45:00] <ahop> arthurvr : before I had one click listener for each button
[08:45:10] <ahop> so I had 10 times AJAX in my code
[08:45:13] <ahop> now only one :)
[08:45:19] <arthurvr> That’s possible but it would be kind of annoying huh
[08:45:29] <ahop> what is possible?
[08:45:32] <arthurvr> saves quite a buncha bytese as well I guess
[08:45:45] <arthurvr> one listener for each :D
[08:45:52] <arthurvr> ~bytes
[08:45:55] * arthurvr can’t type
[08:46:30] <AssassinsMod> is it possible to add a constructor to a js object?
[08:46:56] <arthurvr> what do you mean with adding it to an object. A constructor is technically a function so you can have it as a method yea
[08:47:40] <ahop> thx arthurvr
[08:48:48] <AssassinsMod> `var foo = { name: "name", id: 0 }` something that allows me to do `var f = new foo("name", 1);`
[08:49:01] <arthurvr> oh let me fiddle something for you
[08:50:24] <AssassinsMod> before making you work I found this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/Contributor_s_Guide/Classes_and_Inheritance
[08:50:43] <arthurvr> Yeah that’s quite what you need
[08:51:08] <arthurvr> ES6 will make this much easier by the way
[08:51:36] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: that tutorial uses ES6 classes so won’t really work out of the box
[08:52:29] <AssassinsMod> i'll arrange something
[08:52:33] <AssassinsMod> thanks anyway
[08:52:45] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: you’re welcome
[08:53:16] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: this would basically cover your foo example: http://jsbin.com/pivucocepo/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[08:53:32] <arthurvr> note the uppercase C
[08:54:26] <AssassinsMod> where's it?
[08:54:31] <AssassinsMod> oh
[08:54:38] <AssassinsMod> yeah noticed
[08:55:54] <AssassinsMod> ty
[09:07:35] <user_corrupt> I have the following two scripts on an index.php: http://pastie.org/10059427 and I have been told by a professional that I need to move the scripts to their own .js files, and that I need to avoid dynamically adding values through PHP variables and use AJAX (or a couple of other options instead) instead. I have moved the scripts to their own .js files, and I am looking for some advice as to how to start going about doing this properly now.
[09:08:10] <arthurvr> you’ve already got them linked up in the php file again?
[09:08:33] <user_corrupt> http://pastie.org/10059425
[09:08:37] <user_corrupt> is what I actually have
[09:08:42] <user_corrupt> in the .js file
[09:08:47] <arthurvr> You need to tell the browser to go search that script there
[09:09:15] <arthurvr> You will need something similar to <script src=”path/to/script.js”></script>  for all scripts.
[09:09:22] <arthurvr> This tells the browser to find the script there.
[09:09:30] <user_corrupt> oh yeah, I have that part done
[09:09:32] <user_corrupt> it's linked
[09:09:35] <arthurvr> okay perfect.
[09:09:42] <arthurvr> well now the ajax part.
[09:11:02] <arthurvr> I’m going to suggest you to read up on http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ first.
[09:11:11] <arthurvr> Be sure to ask when you have any questions.
[09:11:36] <user_corrupt> ok, I'll do that now, and hopefully it leads to some more informed lines of qustioning
[09:11:40] <user_corrupt> thanks
[09:11:51] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: Sure!
[09:12:16] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: There are many people in here willing to help you if you have any questions (but the learning center exists with a reason ;))
[09:19:35] <user_corrupt> arturvr: I understand that AJAX basicaly exists so that your website can communicate with the server and update parts of your page as opposed to the whole thing, but I don't actually understand how that relates to setting a JS variable dynamically… I don't understand where AJAX actually comes into play here
[09:19:43] <user_corrupt> arthurvr
[09:20:07] <arthurvr> Let me explain.
[09:21:01] <arthurvr> I guess you was doing things like var foo = ”<?php echo $foo; ?>”; or similar huh?
[09:21:35] <arthurvr> That’s not a good practice for various reasons
[09:21:37] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: ^
[09:22:06] <arthurvr> first of all it’s better to keep your apps structured (separation of concerns)
[09:22:23] <arthurvr> You’re front end code should in fact totally not live in the same places your back end api lives
[09:22:43] <arthurvr> also it’s generally not a best practice security-wise.
[09:25:09] <arthurvr> You’re whole app could break (or get hacked) when there’s some piece of javascript in these php strings.
[09:25:23] <arthurvr> XSS you know
[09:25:31] <arthurvr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting
[09:25:55] <arthurvr> Plus having things separated is gonna help you with maintainability on the long run
[09:26:19] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: ^
[09:30:01] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: tl;dr Your back-end API should be separated and ajax should query it
[09:35:29] <proycon> I'm doing $(foo).append("<bar></bar>") and would like that what has just been appended returned, can I do so elegantly?
[09:37:58] <Kamuela> PSA: Don't update to Webstorm 10 on Ubuntu. Massive errors will borke everything you hold dear
[09:45:41] <user_corrupt> arthurvr: Yeah, I was doing like        var foo = ”<?php echo $foo; ?>”;             and I do understand how it is better to keep things separated for various reasons, but I guess that what I am saying is that I don't know how to wrap my mind around how AJAX is going to help me assign      var foo      from the value that exists in PHP
[09:50:54] <user_corrupt> I guess that my script needs to send a request to the server and then listen for a reponse which will be the value that gets assigned?
[09:50:59] <user_corrupt> is that sort of the logic?
[09:54:08] <arthurvr> It is
[09:54:09] <arthurvr> something like
[09:54:12] <arthurvr> GET service.tld/app/listOfThings
[09:54:23] <arthurvr> which would return JSON
[09:54:34] <arthurvr> and you can use in your client-side
[09:59:15] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: ^
[10:00:09] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: Let me fiddle a real world example for you
[10:00:56] <user_corrupt> arthurvr: ok, great to know that I have more of a concept now.. I guess what I will do is take the PHP that I am currently using and turn it into it's own file that I can start formatting to return the JSON that I need.. does that sound logical?
[10:01:16] <arthurvr> That’s a really good start!
[10:01:37] <arthurvr> again, if you need help doing the actual jQuery stuff we’re all here :)
[10:02:29] <user_corrupt> Thanks a lot man. It's really good to know that I may be able to actually evolve as a self-taught code monkey
[10:03:30] <arthurvr> You’re welcome user_corrupt
[10:14:40] <igrach> #asd
[10:29:22] <minyng> ISTR there was a cool jquery site demo'ing effects in a slide-show fashion with text promoting jquery.. does this sound familiar or what is the 'coolest' jquery live demo site?
[11:30:13] <user_corrupt> how do I replace the number 25 with a JS variable in the following line: jQuery('#leftMeterBar').animate({height:"25%"}, 5000, 'swing');
[11:30:39] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: fiddling something for you
[11:31:08] <user_corrupt> here is the JSON, btw: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php
[11:31:13] <user_corrupt> arthurvr
[11:32:46] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: http://jsbin.com/tubuhoruhe/1/edit?js,output
[11:32:48] <ggherdov`> what's the canonical suggestion if people asks for a book on jquery ?
[11:32:53] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: but in percentages, of course.
[11:32:58] <arthurvr> ggherdov: learn.jquery.com lol
[11:33:13] <arthurvr> ggherdov`: ^
[11:33:21] <paulvd> user_corrupt: {height: ' + variable}
[11:33:23] <ggherdov`> arthurvr: ok
[11:44:20] <user_corrupt> arthurvr: if I just do like     var noPercentage = '25%'       then I can just use that variable in the script that I already have. Does that seem like an ok approach?
[11:50:19] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: depends on the rest of your script but noramlly it’s var foo = 25 and then height: foo + ‘%’
[11:53:03] <user_corrupt> well, I have dones some concatenating in the PHP script so that the JSON output should work with what I have once I figure out how to send the request and process the reponse..
[11:55:13] <user_corrupt> I have this JSON here: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php and I have to figure out how to use it with this script here: http://pastie.org/10059668.. how should I start going about setting up the request/retrieval from the server?
[11:56:24] <user_corrupt> I guess something like you said        GET service.tld/app/listOfThings
[12:33:29] <user_corrupt> I have the following script http://pastie.org/10059733 doing a jQuery.get and sending and alert that it is successfully loading the following JSON file: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php what I need help with is actually grabbing the values that I need from the array and putting them into the right variables
[12:33:52] <user_corrupt> *JSON array
[12:36:47] <arthurvr> user_corrupt: use getJSON, to make sure jQuery parses the json to a real array for you
[12:42:19] <user_corrupt> stupid client keeps crashing
[12:42:31] <user_corrupt> sorry if I missed a reponse, but here is my question one last time
[12:42:32] <user_corrupt> I have the following script http://pastie.org/10059733 doing a jQuery.get and sending an alert that it is successfully loading the following PHP file: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php what I need help with is actually grabbing the values that I need from the JSON array and putting them into the right variables
[12:42:46] <paulvd> lol?
[12:42:54] <user_corrupt> what
[12:44:43] <Velveeta> user_corrupt: that looks correct syntactically, at least the receiving of the 'data' parameter, and sticking it into some element, although you'll probably get [object Object] as an output or something... what variables are you trying to plug those values into?
[12:45:18] <user_corrupt> shiyzer..
[12:46:11] <Velveeta> what is that.. i don't even..
[12:51:22] <user_corrupt> ok, so my client has been crashing and I don't know if anyone has responded to this or not
[12:51:33] <user_corrupt> I'm just gonna stay in this one room for now
[12:51:36] <user_corrupt> and try one last time
[12:51:38] <user_corrupt> I have the following script http://pastie.org/10059733 doing a jQuery.get and sending an alert that it is successfully loading the following PHP file: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php what I need help with is actually grabbing the values that I need from the JSON array and putting them into the right variables
[12:52:30] <Velveeta> i posted this in response: user_corrupt: that looks correct syntactically, at least the receiving of the 'data' parameter, and sticking it into some element, although you'll probably get [object Object] as an output or something... what variables are you trying to plug those values into?
[12:53:13] <user_corrupt> Velveeta: these: http://pastie.org/10059733#6-9
[12:53:58] <user_corrupt> but I guess the JSON needs to be "parsed" first?
[12:54:03] <Velveeta> ok, so you may be running into a pretty common mistake, which is that you're treating asynchronous code in a synchronous fashion... when js executes that call to $.get, while it processes in the background, the interpreter continues immediately to the next line for execution
[12:54:25] <Velveeta> so at the time those variable declarations are hit, that response hasn't actually finished yet, and 'data' doesn't actually exist yet
[12:54:43] <Velveeta> you need to tell that later code to wait until the ajax request completes before processing that code
[12:56:13] <Velveeta> something like this: http://pastie.org/10059766
[12:57:43] <user_corrupt> ok, so you start by putting the variables inside the anonymous function that gets the data?
[12:58:05] <user_corrupt> velveeta
[12:58:41] <Velveeta> well, depending on where you're going to reference them, you may need to declare them at a higher scope level (like i did at the top, so they'll be available outside of that $.get callback)
[12:58:56] <Velveeta> but they won't actually be initialized with data until that ajax request completes
[13:00:58] <user_corrupt> ok, well they do initialize after I hit ok on the alert, and they are available where I need them (in the script below), so I guess that I just need to figure out how to load them with the values from the JSON array?
[13:01:05] <user_corrupt> https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/inc/retrieve.php
[13:01:37] <Velveeta> go set their values from that json array, you have to set them within that callback
[13:01:57] <Velveeta> you can set whatever default values you want outside of that callback, as you'd previously done, but that data response is only available within that callback
[13:02:28] <Velveeta> one other way (unadvised) would be to run that request as synchronous vs asynchronous, and that will stop execution of your script until that request completes...
[13:02:53] <Velveeta> you'll still only have access to 'data' within that callback, so if you wanted it to be available afterwards, you'd have to assign some other variable to it, which lives at a higher level of scope
[13:03:37] <user_corrupt> well I just noticed that removing the alert causes the dummy values to not get loaded by the script below
[13:04:06] <user_corrupt> which I guess has to do with the scope issues you are describing
[13:04:23] <user_corrupt> I dunno
[13:04:28] <user_corrupt> I'm cofused
[13:04:33] <user_corrupt> *confused
[13:05:54] <user_corrupt> ok, nevermind, the dummy variables just plain aren't available to the script below
[13:06:07] <user_corrupt> when they are set inside the callback
[13:06:11] <user_corrupt> hmm
[13:09:12] <user_corrupt> Velveeta: so how far away am I from a sane approach towards trying to load those values from that JSON into those variables to use in the script below?
[13:09:27] <Velveeta> if you don't declare them outside of the callback, then that's correct, they're not available to the code below... if you 'var' them inside the callback, they're only available within the callback
[13:10:18] <Velveeta> as far as how far away you are, that depends... those code chunks are wrapped in function calls themselves, meters() and counts()
[13:10:22] <Velveeta> when do you call those functions?
[13:10:30] <user_corrupt> on page load
[13:10:43] <Velveeta> ok, gotcha
[13:10:54] <Velveeta> then let me show you how to refactor that so that it *should* work
[13:11:07] <user_corrupt> thanks
[13:11:42] <Velveeta> i'm gonna make the assumption that the 'data' object has properties that share the same names as those variables, for assignment purposes, like data.noPercent, etc
[13:13:10] <user_corrupt> yeah
[13:13:12] <Velveeta> so, first, you would want to remove your page load calls to those 2 functions
[13:13:18] <Velveeta> and then do something like this: http://pastie.org/10059788
[13:13:38] <Velveeta> you declare the variables outside of the callback so that they're available to that whole block of code, then you initialize them when your ajax response completes
[13:13:57] <Velveeta> and then also within the callback, after those variables are initialized, you invoke meters() and counts()
[13:14:22] <Velveeta> and actually, technically, you should wrap those 2 lines (where meters() and counts() are called inside the $.get callback) in a document.ready wrapper
[13:14:46] <Velveeta> more like this: http://pastie.org/10059790
[13:18:59] <user_corrupt> Thank you, but it does not yet work for some reason. Only with dummy values assigned "inside the callback".
[13:19:42] <Velveeta> can you console.log that 'data' object and add it to your paste so i can see what the response looks like?
[13:21:52] <user_corrupt> I have console open in Chrome, but I don't actually know what to do next
[13:22:29] <Velveeta> within the callback to $.get, add console.log(data), and then when the page loads, check your console to see what it output
[13:22:40] <Velveeta> and then copy/paste that into your pastie
[13:24:37] <user_corrupt> you said to put that in the callback, right?
[13:24:42] <Velveeta> yep
[13:25:21] <user_corrupt> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[13:25:21] <user_corrupt> (index):95 Uncaught ReferenceError: meters is not defined
[13:26:29] <Velveeta> interesting.. those function declarations should be hoisted to the top of the script.. oh well, physically try moving that whole jQuery.get() call down below where those functions are declared
[13:28:17] <user_corrupt> one question: when you asked me to add a document ready function, did you mean more than this here:   jQuery(function () {
[13:28:18] <user_corrupt>     meters();
[13:28:19] <user_corrupt>     counts();
[13:28:20] <user_corrupt>   });
[13:28:28] <user_corrupt> ok, I'll pastie that next time
[13:28:43] <Velveeta> nope, that was all i meant
[13:28:52] <user_corrupt> ok, nevermind
[13:30:25] <user_corrupt> this is what I've done, but I get the same output: http://pastie.org/10059821
[13:32:01] <user_corrupt> ok, I apologize - I'd moved the page onload from the wrong spot
[13:34:19] <user_corrupt> now I just get an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" which actually points to the             jQuery.get, add console.log(data);            that is inside the callback
[13:34:45] <Velveeta> yeah, that's not a valid line, remove "jQuery.get, add"
[13:34:54] <Velveeta> you just want the console.log(data)
[13:35:44] <user_corrupt> heh, yep
[13:35:55] <user_corrupt> derp
[13:36:24] <user_corrupt> http://pastie.org/10059831 is the output
[13:39:27] <Velveeta> ok, that's the problem, it's passing that back as a string of html comments *plus* some json, not as just a json string, so jquery is casting it as a string when it does its best guess as to data type
[13:39:47] <Velveeta> and since it's seeing it as a string, the properties data.yesCount, etc don't exist as properties
[13:40:02] <Velveeta> so those variable assignments are just going to be undefined
[13:42:54] <user_corrupt> Velveeta: I see, so where might I be able to set the data type to JSON?
[13:44:59] <Velveeta> well, if you explicitly set the dataType to json, you'll get an error in jquery when it tries to parse that as json
[13:45:13] <Velveeta> you need to track down in your back end code where those html comments are being piped out as part of that response, and prevent those
[13:45:44] <Velveeta> and then when jquery examines the response, it should be able to duck type it as json without you having to specify that yourself, so long as the output is limited to *just* the json string like it should be
[13:48:27] <user_corrupt> Velveeta: does this console output still look faulty? {"yesCount":"15","noCount":"18","yesPercent":45.4545454545,"noPercent":54.5454545455}
[13:48:39] <Velveeta> if that's the only console output, then that looks good
[13:49:19] <Velveeta> to make sure it's casting it properly as a json object and not a string, though, you can change that console.log from console.log(data) to console.log(typeof data)
[13:54:45] <user_corrupt> Velveeta: it says "string"
[13:56:04] <Velveeta> oh wait, yes that's right, i think $.get internall defines the dataType as html... try changing that jQuery.get to jQuery.getJSON
[14:02:21] <user_corrupt> great, that works, thanks a lot
[14:03:13] <user_corrupt> my only problem now is that I have to figure out how to surround my percentages in quotes and a percentage when I use them in the script
[14:03:51] <user_corrupt> because concatenating those characters in my JSON output is not a viable option, correct?
[14:15:36] <DragonPunch> im having an issue with this lib called DropzoneJS...I can get images to upload just fine via the lib however if I want to append any extra data or say there are more inputs than just the "upload a file" input and I want that addditional data to be sent, how do I make it work? im doing it via jQuery
[14:16:40] <Velveeta> user_corrupt: you can include them in the values if you escape them, like {"noPercent": "\"23.4567%\""} but i would really make that a part of the view you're plugging them into, vs the data response itself
[14:18:50] <user_corrupt> I'm looking into how to concatenate it in the JS variables that we have been declaring in the callback
[14:18:59] <user_corrupt> does that sound logical?
[14:19:04] <user_corrupt> velveeta
[14:20:06] <Velveeta> so like assigning your noPercent variable to something like this? noPercent = '"' + data.noPercent + '"';
[14:22:52] <user_corrupt> well, it needs to end up looking like        '25%'     for example
[14:25:04] <user_corrupt>   noPercent = "" + data.noPercent + "%";
[14:25:06] <user_corrupt> works
[14:26:15] <Velveeta> oh i gotcha, i thought you were saying you wanted to put it in quotes
[14:27:04] <user_corrupt> thanks a lot man
[14:27:12] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[14:30:30] <anix> is there a way to do something before an element is deleted by $("#elmA').remove() ?
[14:31:18] <Velveeta> you can overwrite the $.fn.remove function with one that emits a 'remove' event or something and then calls back to the original function, and then bind a 'remove' event listener to that element to do your cleanup...
[14:31:35] <Velveeta> i think that's what jquery ui does to handle cleanup of data from removed elements
[14:32:58] <anix> thanks, Velveeta, i think this is what i was looking for :)
[14:33:04] <Velveeta> :)
[14:40:05] <anix> Velveeta, in case of elements applied to a small plugin, would `_destroy: function(){/*do cleanup*/}` inside the plugin already do the job?
[14:40:53] <Velveeta> when you say plugin, do you mean a jquery ui widget (i ask because of the _destroy() reference) or do you mean a traditional-style jquery plugin like $.fn.myPlugin = function (blah) {}
[14:41:33] <anix> Velveeta, a traditional-style jQuery plugin
[14:42:17] <Velveeta> then i'd say *probably* not... chances are, that function is in place for when you explicitly call $(element).myPlugin('destroy'), but that it won't automatically destroy itself when the element is removed
[14:42:42] <Velveeta> that's where you'd want to overwrite $.fn.remove, and do something like $(element).on('remove', function () { $(this).myPlugin('destroy'); });
[14:43:00] <anix> ok, thank you
[14:43:05] <Velveeta> no problemo
[15:12:18] <zhan_> $('category').change(function() {if       ($(this).vals() == '1') $('high_form').show() });
[15:12:37] <zhan_> this is meant to expose <div id> upon dropdown selection
[15:12:52] <zhan_> my friend told me, and i can't work it
[15:19:18] <Velveeta> zhan_: .vals() isn't a function, you might be looking for .val(), no 's'
[15:19:51] <Velveeta> and also, $('category') isn't a valid selector more than likely, is that supposed to be an id attribute? like $('#category') ?
[15:20:29] <frank_o> yup, same with $('high_form')
[15:21:05] <zhan_> dropdown selector
[15:21:37] <zhan_> is category, meant to bew
[15:21:57] <zhan_> high form is id though
[15:22:49] <zhan_> I'm using rails select helper, so :Class, :category is an ID?
[15:24:31] <zhan_> what goes where?
[15:24:39] <frank_o> zhan_: you got a gist or something?
[15:24:51] <zhan_> ye
[15:26:36] <zhan_> https://gist.github.com/janat08/2def88892cbf04a0a544
[15:29:29] <frank_o> i dont know, that doesnt make any sense
[15:30:08] <zhan_> well there's a dropdown that needs to decide which of 3 '.forms' needs to unhide
[15:30:12] <zhan_> they have different IDs
[15:30:59] <frank_o> my suggestion would be to get the html+js right first and then move on to the rails part
[15:33:02] <zhan_> im talking about html+js
[15:33:18] <zhan_> dropdown that decides*
[15:33:21] <Velveeta> i think he's saying his rails code generates that js
[15:33:48] <Velveeta> or maybe not, i'm not sure
[15:34:16] <zhan_> i was questioning if having rails generate html interferes with jquery function
[15:34:42] <Velveeta> no, that wouldn't have any effect, the browser doesn't know anything about rails, only about the html it receives
[15:34:56] <zhan_> the question is this though, where do i put what with :$('category').change(function() {if       ($(this).vals() == '1') $('high_form').show() })
[15:35:02] <Velveeta> so unless your rails app is sending malformed html, it wouldn't matter
[15:35:07] <Velveeta> your problem is that your js is incorrect
[15:35:17] <zhan_> i know val
[15:35:17] <frank_o> zhan_: that usually goes into app/assets/javascripts/application.js
[15:35:25] <Velveeta> as previously stated, both category and high_form are invalid selectors
[15:35:26] <zhan_> relly?
[15:35:27] <zhan_> k
[15:35:28] <frank_o> well, that's where i'd put it
[15:35:39] <zhan_> w8 shouldn't it go on the relevant page
[15:35:47] <zhan_> the form page, rather than application?
[15:36:03] <zhan_> and why not stick it with html?
[15:36:18] <zhan_> *rather than applicaiton.js
[15:37:19] <frank_o> actually i got my code in app/assets/javascripts/form.js
[15:38:46] <frank_o> i dont know, js inside your erb isnt very sexy imho, best have everything in one place, i think sprockets likes that better as well
[15:39:34] <zhan_> how does it know that it belongs to that page
[15:39:44] <zhan_> cuz its not a navbar or something is it
[15:40:00] <zhan_> although i suppose doesn't matter
[15:40:14] <zhan_> so how do i correct my jquery?
[15:41:17] <jquery445> hello? Using a dialog, how can I stay it open when I submit a form?
[15:43:08] <Tomashe> Hey guys im using jquerymobile but on my iphone when i click "back" it just give me empty page . any ieas?
[15:43:42] <frank_o> zhan_: i see what you mean. i use jquery mobile so i can bind specific js to specific pages. but in your case maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3437585/best-way-to-add-page-specific-javascript-in-a-rails-3-app would help
[15:44:01] <jquery445> Hello, using a dialog, how can I stay it open when I submit a form?
[15:44:23] <zhan_> well the problem is frank_o is actually gettting the code to function =.=
[15:44:28] <zhan_> as i said earlier several times
[15:44:46] <Velveeta> have you changed those selectors yet?
[15:44:50] <frank_o> i dunno i just joined
[15:45:13] <Velveeta> because that was said earlier several times also
[15:47:50] <frank_o> yup zhan_ get it to function without rails first: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:48:08] <zhan_> i just don't know what is suppose to go in which order
[15:49:17] <zhan_> and what are valid selectors
[15:50:23] <Velveeta> you need to use css-style selectors
[15:50:42] <Velveeta> so some kind of class or id type of selector more than likely, for these purposes
[15:50:52] <Velveeta> because $('category') doesn't target anything in the document currently
[15:53:49] <ktk7777> Anyone willing to help with an issue I'm running into with ajax on my rails app? more details about the issue can be found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29323456/polling-for-changes-to-database-and-append-new-changes-to-the-view-in-rails-usin thanks in advance!
[15:55:00] <frank_o> ktk7777: you *really* ought to provide some code
[15:55:03] <zhan_> category i think is the id [select, :corporation, ;category [placeholder, nil], etc. ]
[15:55:48] <frank_o> ktk7777: lucky for you though I just finished a much improved version of railscasts #229 using http caching as well, check it out: https://gist.github.com/dt1973/fc7a3abb354457946fc8
[15:57:22] <ktk7777> @frank_o thanks! i'll take a look at this
[15:58:33] <frank_o> ktk7777: on the rails side you need to implement https://robots.thoughtbot.com/introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails
[16:00:12] <shockwave> WHat's the difference between text() and val()?
[16:00:13] <zhan_> hey, hey you're the railcasts guy
[16:00:21] <zhan_> val is value
[16:00:34] <zhan_> and i still don't know what i'm doing
[16:00:53] <zhan_> two things, what selectors go where, and if select helper has id
[16:01:02] <shockwave> why not just always use val() then?/
[16:02:35] <frank_o> zhan_: please set up a test case using a normal html <select> in http://jsfiddle.net first :-)
[16:03:08] <zhan_> im using bootstrap it gets positively arsed with plain html
[16:04:14] <frank_o> zhan_: no need for bootstrap in a reduced testcase. do check out https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ it's probably the most mentioned URL in this channel
[16:06:49] <zhan_> frank_o, i honestly just have to add id to select helper though and get the order straight
[16:10:57] <zhan_> help any1
[16:21:22] <zhan_> $('category').change(function() {if       ($(this).vals() == '1') $('high_form').show() });
[16:21:26] <zhan_> how does this work
[16:23:19] <rcyr> No idea. AFAIK, jQuery doesn't have a vals() fonction
[16:23:53] <rcyr> And there are no 'category' and 'high_form' HTML tags
[16:28:48] <zhan_> w8
[16:28:54] <zhan_> it has to target actual html tags
[16:28:58] <zhan_> rather than id or css?
[16:30:57] <rcyr> Do you know CSS?
[17:28:52] <cgeo> is there an easy way to turn off a whole bunch of event listeners at once?
[19:26:22] <NinjaBanjo> cgeo: can you give an example of your issue?
[19:26:38] <NinjaBanjo> you can call .off() without arguments, and it will unbind all on that selector
[19:26:54] <NinjaBanjo> but that will only unbind jQuery listeners,.
[21:50:35] <FrankD_> anyone here familiar with jsTree?
[21:51:30] <Woet> FrankD_: You don't have to ask to ask, or state: "I have a question", Don't ask: "Is anyone around?" or "Can anyone help?". Just Ask The Question. Also, please read: http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[21:51:39] <FrankD_> yar
[21:51:52] <FrankD_> using jsTree, how can I define whether an item is a 'file
[21:52:19] <FrankD_> using jsTree, how can I define whether an item is a 'file' or a 'folder' for a file browser? Also are icon assignments automatic based on that?
[21:52:43] <FrankD_> using HTML data as the input
[22:27:29] <ajf-> How can I mimic this exact request with $.ajax ? curl 'https://url.com' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"mykey":"myval"}'
[22:27:59] <ajf-> I can see that using XHR, the data shows up as "Request Payload" instead of form data...
[22:31:04] <rcyr> Sure
[22:31:55] <rcyr> $.ajax({ url: "https://url.com", contentType: "application/json", data: JSON.stringify({myKey: "myVal"}), processData: false })
[22:31:57] <rcyr> IIRC
[22:36:25] <ajf-> This is weird
[22:37:00] <ajf-> I'm trying to do the same request that my app is doing through my phone. It is not on the same origin as the url and sends an Origin: file:// property, and it works.
[22:37:04] <ajf-> On curl, it works.
[22:37:39] <ajf-> but through XHR or $.ajax, I always get no Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[22:37:43] <ajf-> any ideas?
[22:38:30] <ajf-> even if I set -H 'Origin: http://localhost:8000' to make it look like the request that the browser sends, it still works on cURL
