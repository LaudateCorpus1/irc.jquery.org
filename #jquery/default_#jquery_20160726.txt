[02:50:32] <gingitsune> Anyone here familiar with summernote?
[02:50:57] <gingitsune> Is it possible override/ provide a callback for the dragndrop feature?
[03:46:54] <lilalinuxHamburg> How can I select all elements with classes foo-1 or foo-2 and so on AND have the number passed to the handler?
[03:53:08] <red_> values=i.split('-');
[03:53:08] <red_> one=values[0]; // = foo
[03:53:08] <red_> two=values[1]; // = 1
[03:53:27] <Bruteforx> join #jQuery
[03:54:21] <red_> then use the variable to select
[03:54:55] <Bruteforx> Hi
[03:55:36] <Bruteforx> I need some jquery help please
[03:58:53] <Bruteforx> Please why is my code not working. I am trying to create a button in an already created page. Below is my code:
[04:01:51] <slax0r> lilalinuxHamburg: you can find an answer to your issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5111272/selecting-classes-using-wildcard-not-exact-class-name
[04:02:09] <slax0r> as for getting the number of the class as input to the handler, well, you can forget about that
[04:02:32] <lilalinuxHamburg> slax0r: thank you. So you have to extract the number inside the handler independantly from the selector
[04:03:07] <lilalinuxHamburg> It would be nice to have some sort of regex selector which automatically passes the submatches (groups)
[04:03:43] <slax0r> normally what I would do is, use a common class name, .foo, and add those numbers to a data-* parameter in the element
[04:04:09] <slax0r> then your selector is a simple '.foo' and you can access $(this).data("number") inside the handler easily
[04:04:16] <slax0r> no split-mumbo-jumbo required
[04:05:00] <lilalinuxHamburg> slax0r: that's what I doo
[04:05:30] <lilalinuxHamburg> What's i'm trying now is to add click handlers to all .foo with the number as parameter in the url
[04:06:01] <lilalinuxHamburg> without having to know the numbers in advance
[04:06:25] <lilalinuxHamburg> <div class="foo foo-1">
[04:06:41] <lilalinuxHamburg> oh
[04:06:47] <lilalinuxHamburg> you put the number in another attribute
[04:07:02] <slax0r> yes, data-number="1" i.e.
[04:07:09] <lilalinuxHamburg> great!
[04:07:18] <slax0r> and you can access it though .data("number") then
[04:07:39] <lilalinuxHamburg> slax0r++
[04:07:51] <slax0r> there is also some regex selector filter: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[04:08:07] <slax0r> but I don't know if it passes matches to handler, you will have to check this out yourself
[04:20:00] <lilalinuxHamburg> this makes things so much simpler
[04:20:38] <lilalinuxHamburg> (the data attribute)
[04:23:15] <Bruteforx> Please why is my code not working. I am trying to create a button in an already created page. Below is my code:
[04:23:34] <Bruteforx> https://jsfiddle.net/xcpkrt0t/
[04:51:50] <gingitsune> Is it possible to load two versions of the same jquery plugin/module just as you can load jquery in noConflict mode?
[05:19:32] <lilalinuxHamburg> gingitsune: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1566595/can-i-use-multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page
[05:20:30] <gingitsune> lilalinuxHamburg: What I was thinking of though was a jquery plugin
[05:20:42] <lilalinuxHamburg> i see
[05:20:54] <gingitsune> I'm working with a framework that comes with the summernote editor, yet I want a more up to date version
[05:21:17] <lilalinuxHamburg> I never worked with plugins, sorry
[05:21:28] <gingitsune> Thanks ok, thanks anyway
[05:28:33] <fvulpes> Hi, I'm trying to communicate with an API using CORS in JS. I keep getting this: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. How do I add that header with CORS?
[05:39:32] <fvulpes> Anyone know? ~
[06:37:58] <ESTNSC> my page is that http://www.valjalapesumaja.eu/pesu/test/index.php and i wish that if you select customer "Classic Kohvik-Tavapesu" and click "EDASI" button shows input tag placeholder selected option
[06:38:46] <ESTNSC> my code is here http://pastebin.com/GtkpSyH5
[06:53:06] <jomofcw> Hello ! Using custom jQuery UI Selectmenu Widget, I've got an error "this._renderItem(...) is undefined" but I can't figure out why... any idea ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6a78e37165d97bf1a8be990b4236e505
[07:40:06] <baako> hi guys anyone use jquery validator library before? if yes what is the rule to make a field have at least One Uppercase Letter, One Lowercase Letter and one number
[07:40:41] <taplar_> sounds like a custom validator.
[07:42:18] <baako> taplar_, got it thanks
[07:47:28] <cerion> hi. Can I omit the domain name like I do for image when making an ajax request ?
[07:48:23] <taplar_> sure you can make non-absolute url ajax requests
[07:48:50] <cerion> starting with a slash
[07:49:32] <taplar_> , / or ./ or ../ or even without the slash.  whatever works for your issue
[07:50:40] <cerion> and another domain ? I got the error about Allow-Control-Access-Origin and a 401 on preflight. is there anything I can do or it's the third party server that is not configured right for CORS ?
[07:51:21] <taplar_> ACAO would be the other server isn't configured to allow yours
[07:52:02] <cerion> taplar_: ok.
[07:52:04] <cerion> thanks
[07:52:09] <taplar_> 401 though, that's unauthorized
[07:52:15] <taplar_> like it's expecting login credentials
[07:52:56] <taplar_> ah, apparently some sites return 401 for cors too.  interesting
[07:53:07] <cerion> yes. I supplied the Authorization header but I wonder if I made something wrong in jquery/ajax
[07:53:43] <cerion> I used $.ajax(...,headers:{'Authorization':'Bearer xxxxxxxx'},...);
[07:53:49] <taplar_> you can check your network tab to see the request that is sent to make sure it's being sent correctly, for starters
[07:54:23] <cerion> taplar_: it fails at http OPTIONS what's called preflight. I can't see my headers being sent yet
[07:55:14] <cerion> taplar_: never mind. I use my site as proxy. bad for latency...
[07:56:06] <taplar_> mmm, wish i could help more. i don't really mess with auth and/or cors much
[08:01:21] <jomofcw> Using custom jQuery UI Selectmenu Widget, I've got an error "this._renderItem(...) is undefined" but I can't figure out why... any idea, please ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6a78e37165d97bf1a8be990b4236e505
[08:13:20] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/5y36rvbt/1/  not sure, i one lined line 20 and it works now.
[08:15:36] <jomofcw> Hello Tadas !
[08:15:38] <jomofcw> ...
[08:15:42] <jomofcw> Hello taplar_ !
[08:15:53] <jomofcw> this one is good :D. Thanks for your answer I give it a look.0
[08:16:14] <Tadas> You w0t m8?
[08:16:18] <Tadas> You havin' a giggle?
[08:19:35] <jomofcw> Tadas ^^.
[08:19:43] <taplar_> jomofcw: ah it seems if the $li is not on the same line as the return, that is what the error is
[08:19:56] <taplar_> it appears to interpret it as unreachable code and bombs
[08:20:02] <jomofcw> taplar_ thanks it works well ! That was obvious :/ return doesn't accept a line break :/.
[08:20:12] <taplar_> coolio
[08:26:16] <iaj_> Hi there :)  Can someone lend me a hand, how could I select all select boxes that don't contain any options?
[08:26:48] <taplar_> what have you tried?
[08:27:07] <iaj_> something along the lines of $("#selectId").options.length = 0;
[08:27:26] <iaj_> But I dont know how to make that a selector :D
[08:27:44] <taplar_> options, if that is an Element property, wouldn't be exposed on the jQuery object
[08:27:59] <taplar_> take a look at filter()
[08:28:12] <iaj_> thanks gonna do
[08:47:14] <jomofcw> iaj_ : https://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[08:47:52] <jomofcw> iaj_ : use it with a :not() selector (https://api.jquery.com/?s=%3Anot%28%29)
[08:48:28] <jomofcw> something like $('select:not(:has(option))')
[08:49:09] <jomofcw> iaj_ or kinda better : https://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/ > $('select:empty')
[08:49:23] <jomofcw> But it won't work in case the select contain optgroup.
[08:50:41] <jomofcw> iaj_ direct link to ":not()" doc : https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[08:50:44] <jomofcw> There you go ^^.
[08:51:32] <iaj_> jomofcw: hmm yeah I try that.. but actually
[08:51:37] <iaj_> There is one value inside
[08:51:42] <iaj_> But it's an empty value
[08:53:04] <iaj_> So markup would be like <select><option value=""></option></select>
[08:53:11] <iaj_> And what I wanna do is hide all those select boxes ^^
[08:53:42] <baako> i guys i want to add a class i know the usual way is $( "p" ).addClass( "myClass yourClass" ); the thing with my sturcture is that "p" doesnt exist when the page logs it it added down the link
[09:03:16] <jomofcw> iaj_ : is there this empty option in the other select you don't want to catch ?
[09:04:04] <jomofcw> And so, just a tip : <select></select> will act as your <select><option value=""></option></select> by default...
[09:05:24] <taplar> personally i'd filter on the selects using either innerHTML or possibly the options thing he was doing earlier, and avoid the pseudo selectors
[09:06:11] <iaj_> Ahh yeah thanks... Hm I use a php userfunction to prefill select boxes from a certain database
[09:06:44] <iaj_> jomofcw: the other select boxes are looking like:  <select><option value=""></option><option value="something">something</option></select>
[09:06:53] <iaj_> and shall not be hidden ;-)
[09:07:06] <jomofcw> in the case of <select><option value=""></option></select> you can't get it in a single selector imo. You should use each (https://api.jquery.com/each/) like this : $('select').each(function(i){if $(this).find('option[value=""]:empty')<=1){/* your stuff */});
[09:07:29] <jomofcw> taplar I love pseudo selector too much, I know xD.
[09:08:12] <jomofcw> oups, forget the length thing
[09:08:22] <jomofcw> $('select').each(function(i){if $(this).find('option[value=""]:empty').length<=1){/* your stuff */});
[09:08:24] <jomofcw> better :D
[09:08:46] <jomofcw> Hm and it doesn't work... we need to o it in two times
[09:09:36] <taplar> what is the issue?  i thought he was looking for selects without options?
[09:09:40] <jomofcw> or like this : $('select').each(function(i){if $(this).find('option[value=""]:empty').length==$(this).find('option').length){/* your stuff */});
[09:10:13] <jomofcw> taplar not really, he would like to catch this : <select><option value=""></option></select>
[09:10:19] <iaj_> taplar: actually just the empty value option :)
[09:10:22] <iaj_> cool thanks ill try
[09:10:24] <taplar> oh
[09:10:26] <jomofcw> else, a :not(:has(option)) was enough.
[09:11:47] <jomofcw> iaj_ my syntax will give you all the select containing "empty option" and only "empty option", but in one select if there is more than one empty option, it will catch it too.
[09:11:57] <jomofcw> but should never happen
[09:12:15] <baako> hi guys using jquery validator
[09:12:16] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/o57gv2cs/
[09:12:24] <jomofcw> because '<select><option value=""></option><option value=""></option></select>' is non-sens.
[09:12:32] <baako> the messages doesnt seem to show
[09:13:07] <iaj_> jomofcw: yeah I see... is there something wrong about the syntax tho?
[09:13:18] <iaj_> what is the last ) before the semicolon closing?
[09:13:24] <jomofcw> baako the jQuery UI validation plugin ?
[09:13:34] <baako> jomofcw, yep
[09:13:43] <baako> https://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[09:13:43] <jomofcw> iaj_ closing of the each
[09:13:43] <taplar> baako: the fiddle has an error in the console
[09:14:03] <iaj_> I'm trying this, $('select').each(function(i) {if $(this).find('option[value=""]:empty').length==$(this).find('option').length {alert('hi thare')});
[09:14:08] <baako> i see
[09:14:10] <baako> ,
[09:14:12] <jomofcw> iaj_ : $('select').each(function(i){if ($(this).find('option[value=""]:empty').length==$(this).find('option').length){/* your stuff */});
[09:14:23] <jomofcw> I forget a parenthesis :)
[09:14:46] <jomofcw> baako this is not the jQuery UI validation plugin
[09:15:00] <jomofcw> so please,d on't answer "yes" when you mean "no", it will help :D.
[09:15:03] <baako> forgot to add the jquery link
[09:17:29] <iaj_> jomofcw: thanks, gonna figure it out.. right now I'm getting an Unexpected token ) message :D
[09:22:16] <taplar> baako: https://jsfiddle.net/o57gv2cs/1/ you were missing a comma in the rules, and i dunno what validate js file you had included, but i included the cdn one from the website
[09:23:55] <baako> taplar, did you change anything else?
[09:24:03] <taplar> nope
[09:24:43] <taplar> well i also included jquery, which had not been included on the fiddle
[09:25:03] <taplar> but code wise, just the comma
[09:27:07] <baako> thanks taplar much appreciated
[09:27:43] <z1haze_work> I might be reading something wrong here.. but I have an if condition that checks if an element exists with if(!el.length) { ... but for some reason its coming back that it doesnt exist but right before i run the if check i do a console.dir of the element and im getting it on the page.. any ideas?
[09:28:32] <taplar> console.log the el right before the if and see what it is
[09:31:19] <dfdf> ji
[09:46:51] <sper> Can someone explain why this returns a 404? $.getJSON("https://freegeoip.net/json/",function(data){
[09:46:51] <sper>    console.log(data);
[09:46:51] <sper> });
[09:47:05] <sper> Its not even requesting the page in the network tab
[09:50:40] <sper> omfg are you fucking kidding me fuck adblock! I've been debugging this for 2 FUCKING hours
[09:51:02] <sper> sorry about that but fuck im frustrated
[09:52:34] <z1haze_work> ok sorry, had to run earlier - but here's my issue : https://gyazo.com/c1df5d620a1da2ce6487242f90e9515f the dir() is of the element that in my first log output of true says el.length === 0
[09:52:39] <z1haze_work> how is this possible
[09:54:57] <z1haze_work> i do console.dir(el) and then right after console.log(el.length === 0) and it comes back true.. hmmm
[09:57:18] <z1haze_work> completely at a loss on this one
[09:57:29] <tokam> how to get a dom element from a string which has stripped html tags?
[09:57:39] <tokam> like: &lt;div
[09:58:00] <CatMaus> hey
[09:58:51] <tokam> this does not work for me :(
[09:58:51] <tokam> var decoded = $('<div/>').html(prototype).text();
[09:58:59] <z1haze_work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5002111/javascript-how-to-strip-html-tags-from-string
[09:59:57] <CatMaus> tokam:  what does console say?
[10:00:42] <tokam> ok, I see my code was double escaped
[10:00:44] <tokam> haha :D
[10:01:06] <hellyeah> works now?
[10:01:43] <tokam> not fully but I have html tags now :)
[10:02:05] <tokam> because of twig I forgot, that it escapes everything. Even internally defined already escaped variables
[10:02:30] <tokam> var newEls = jQuery('<div>').html(newWidget).contents();
[10:02:30] <tokam> 			newEls.appendTo(gruenderList);
[10:02:44] <tokam> ahh wait
[10:02:55] <hellyeah> i think you should use jsfiddle
[10:03:15] <tokam> works now
[10:03:20] <hellyeah> good
[10:07:34] <taplar> where you been hellyeah?  haven't seen you in a while
[10:09:12] <hellyeah> i was around here but i am not in the mood nowadays. They are really mobbing me
[10:09:24] <hellyeah> so i am not keen on writing codes nowayds thats bad
[10:09:36] <taplar> :(
[10:09:58] <hellyeah> but i have now
[10:10:08] <hellyeah> hmm i guess
[10:10:42] <hellyeah> actually i need to complete my works i cannot finish but it is hard to concentrate nowadays this place sucks
[10:11:46] <taplar> still having issues with coworkers?
[10:11:54] <hellyeah> yes
[10:12:02] <hellyeah> they force me to change job
[10:13:07] <taplar> oh, so your doing something else now?
[10:13:17] <noname85421> Hello, i goota strange issue, $('a.menu_4').each( - does the job, but $('a.menu_4').click( - no action
[10:13:27] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I have a form which filters a list of items.  I serialize the form and AJAX post it to the server and return a filtered list, simple enough.  Now I would like the filtered form to have a unique URL so it can be shared/linked to, so I'm adding the serialized form data to window.location.hash.
[10:13:38] <jomofcw> I would like to asign a tooltip (using jQuery UI) to each element in a UL, including those that will be added next. Is there a way to do it without call "$newLI.tooltip();" every time ?
[10:13:40] <hellyeah> tbh i am not doing anything currently
[10:13:43] <MarcGuay> Now when the page loads, how can I deserialize that data and populate the form?
[10:13:54] <taplar> noname85421: what do you mean no action?
[10:14:07] <noname85421> Cant get on click action
[10:14:19] <noname85421> Same selector, each function works
[10:14:21] <taplar> noname85421: can you make a fiddle with the issue?
[10:14:28] <codecutter> how can I insertBefore an element that hasClass('foo')?
[10:14:29] <noname85421> one sec
[10:14:43] <codecutter> element is of type li
[10:14:57] <taplar> codecutter: look at before()
[10:16:10] <codecutter> i know that part but I have multiple li's, only one of them does not have class 'foo', i need to select that element first then insert
[10:16:39] <MarcGuay> $('li:not(.foo)')
[10:16:56] <noname85421> taplar: live site is here http://vytishopnew.007.lt
[10:17:17] <taplar> can you make a fiddle?
[10:19:56] <noname85421> i just found issue
[10:20:26] <jomofcw> Is their a way to place a "listener" to detect when a parent get a new child, then do some stuff ? (this is related to my previous question : "I would like to asign a tooltip (using jQuery UI) to each element in a UL, including those that will be added next. Is there a way to do it without call "$newLI.tooltip();" every time ?")
[10:20:51] <taplar> jomofcw: there are observers, but they are not widely supported yet
[10:21:21] <jomofcw> taplar OK :'( so I have to add the tooltip constructor on the process that add the child. Thanks.
[10:21:27] <taplar> yep
[10:22:28] <cmrabet> Hi all
[10:22:44] <taplar> sup
[10:24:02] <cmrabet> I want to have 2 divs inline, one of them hidden, the other one expanded 100% width. Once the user clicks on a button, I want the hidden dive to show up and slide in, and the other one to resize to make both to fit. There are many drawer slide plugins, but all of them seem to translate the visible screen content out of the viewport.. is there any plugin that resizes the divs insted?
[11:00:55] <jose3_> What is your opinion on this ? https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/612b05e13e728a7d8e21565176a808f5 ; I feel as though I am doing something bad, but I can not think of a cleaner way to write this. I will also need top be adding more data to this append.
[11:09:47] <taplar> jose3_: look at using a templating library instead
[11:09:59] <taplar> something like handlebarjs or mustachejs
[11:10:37] <jose3_> taplar thanks!
[11:50:47] <snowmizer> hey guys I've got a donut chart that has a mouseover event that displays a tooltip. When I move the mouse to the edge of the pie segment the tooltip window gets jittery and flickers. I've tried adding a drop-shadow to alleviate the issue but no luck. How can I eliminate the jitter?
[11:54:56] <robertmaxrees> snowmizer without seeing it in action, most people will probably have a hard time helping.  That being said, it sounds like maybe it has something to do with how the segment might be animating or something when the mouse leaves?
[11:56:24] <snowmizer> hummmm
[12:00:16] <snowmizer> so I have the drop-shadow on the path not the arc is that the correct place to put it?
[12:00:23] <robertmaxrees> I have no idea.
[12:00:35] <robertmaxrees> i don't know which plugin you're using or how you have any of it setup.
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it.
[12:01:00] <snowmizer> it's using d3
[12:01:28] <snowmizer> I'll have to keep investigating....thanks
[12:55:02] <mikatone> how can i fire event if checkbox get checked?
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean bind a listener?
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.theCheckbox').on('change', function() {});
[12:55:32] <mikatone> wouldn't $("selectbox_name").on('change')...
[12:55:35] <mikatone> exactly
[12:55:41] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't fire an event.
[12:55:42] <mikatone> but it doesn't work
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> that binds a listener.
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> $("selectbox_name") looks wrong.
[12:55:57] <robertmaxrees> how are you selecting the checkbox?
[12:56:17] <mikatone> by the id $("#name")
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> by the ID or the name attribute?
[12:56:37] <mikatone> id
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> also: are there more than 1 of these checkboxes?
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> and are you adding them dynamically?
[12:57:06] <mikatone> yes actually but with different names and id's
[12:57:25] <mikatone> nope not dynamically
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> then i'd have to see it.
[12:57:45] <mikatone> sure
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> care to make a jsfiddle?

[12:58:08] <mikatone> ups
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> Yeah, that's not enough code to go off of :)
[13:03:38] <mikatone> robertmaxrees what should I do? Any ideia?
[13:03:48] <robertmaxrees> mikatone make a fiddle.
[13:03:56] <mikatone> I mean I got the codepen
[13:04:02] <mikatone> sorry
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> send it to the channel :)
[13:06:23] * taplar awaits the fun
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> hey mikatone - don't PM it to me :)
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> post it in the channel :)
[13:08:45] <robertmaxrees> for context: http://codepen.io/proudbyte/pen/wWXrvx?editors=1111
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you select.
[13:09:04] <robertmaxrees> $("fluid_intervention_type_other") is looking for <fluid_intervention_type_other>
[13:09:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to give that element an ID or a class or otherwise filter for it.
[13:09:51] <mikatone> a name will it work?
[13:09:57] <mikatone> I have a name
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> names are bad for selecting.
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> give it a class or an ID instead.
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> names aren't meant for selecting elements.
[13:11:30] <taplar> i like how it was explicitly asked, name or id
[13:11:30] <katronix> Greetings all, would this be a bad place to ask about making JQuery-UI and Bootstrap to work together? I've tried asking in the Bootstrap channel, but it seems dead at the moment
[13:11:43] <robertmaxrees> taplar heh.  yeah....
[13:11:56] <robertmaxrees> katronix you can ask, but i'd honestly avoid doing that at all costs.
[13:12:45] <mikatone> now I got an id generated by the template... updating codepen
[13:12:59] <robertmaxrees> mikatone so select on your unique ID.
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> slap a # in front of the selector.
[13:13:17] <katronix> robertmaxrees: I'm sure I understand why, however working on a test based website and found one section I had to do in jquery, but because I can't seem to import the bootstrap CSS, those 5 questions look totally different :(
[13:13:17] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> "i can seem top import the bootstrap css" - let's fix that problem katronix :)
[13:13:38] <mikatone> so with checkboxes  need to use id's or classes?
[13:13:47] <robertmaxrees> mikatone again
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> mikatone you can filter using names, but you want to select using IDs or Classes generally.
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> that's true for all elements.
[13:14:12] <mikatone> great to know that
[13:14:16] <mikatone> testing now :D
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> all other attributes aren't really made for selecting.  they're meant to hold information about the element.
[13:15:36] <taplar> the name is like your name on your mailbox.  useful for some purpose, but if you want someone to mail you, your going to give them your address, not your name
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:15:49] <katronix> robertmaxrees: the section that uses jquery is using the sortable plugin, I like the look at http://jqueryui.com/sortable/ however if I use the bootstrap CSS also, the squares around the words get to be about half the height, even when I over ride it :(
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> errrr.
[13:16:07] <robertmaxrees> katronix so you want a sortable widget, yeah?
[13:16:45] <katronix> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:17:25] <robertmaxrees> i might look into something like https://johnny.github.io/jquery-sortable/ instead for that.
[13:17:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui brings in its own styling for everything - it's not that bootstrap CSS isn't loading, it's that it's being stomped all over by the jqui stuff.
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> http://rubaxa.github.io/Sortable/ is another choice.
[13:18:41] <robertmaxrees> but don't haul in all of jqui (which is a lot of stuff) just for a widget.
[13:20:54] <katronix> robertmaxrees: so looking at both of those choices it seems I'd have to rewirte how my php script sees the results? (not a huge issue but ...)
[13:21:08] <katronix> or I should say interprets the results
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> your PHP wouldn't be interpreting anything.
[13:21:21] <robertmaxrees> your JS would.
[13:22:34] <katronix> I might not be using it the standard way, but I have a series of 4 words which you put in order of how they best apply to you. The results are sent to PHP which then interprets the results as part of the rest of the test
[13:22:55] <robertmaxrees> "The results are sent to PHP which then interprets the results as part of the rest of the test" - how are you sending them?
[13:23:20] <katronix> with the sortable plugin I am serializing the results
[13:23:30] <robertmaxrees> and then sending them via ajax or something?
[13:23:39] <katronix> via post
[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> you could very easily transform the data from whatever into the same format.
[13:24:24] <robertmaxrees> no need to change your backend at all.
[13:24:32] <katronix> ok
[13:25:08] <katronix> with what i'm doing in mind, which alternative would you suggest?
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably start with the second one i shot out.
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> or search google for more options.
[13:26:33] <katronix> I don't suppose its possible to load just the sortable plugin w/o the rest of jquery?
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> *jquery ui.
[13:26:45] <robertmaxrees> not jquery.
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> and you could try to do a stripped down build, but you're going to have the same problems you have now.
[13:27:31] <katronix> ok
[13:27:45] <robertmaxrees> because your problems aren't all of jqui - it's the way to builds the widget itself.
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> you're basically trying to munge two UI libaries together :)
[13:29:21] <katronix> yeah, that seems to be always where I'm at :)
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> generally, when you select one library for a job, you want to fully buy into that. DOM abstraction?  don't mix mootools and jquery - use one or the other.  bootstrap vs jqui/jqm, angular vs backbone, etc.
[13:39:11] <katronix> robertmaxrees: I agree, however couldn't find a bootstrap way of doing what I wanted that made it easy for the user to use the test and hard to give bad answers. Sortable to the rescue!
[13:40:07] <robertmaxrees> in those cases, you generally want to resort to searching google for something like bootstrap sortable widget or whatever.
[15:35:54] <katronix> robertmaxrees: are you still here?
[15:36:25] <katronix> or anyone here?
[15:41:42] <momomo> I am trying to express original working -> element.css('height', 'calc(100vh - ' + css.margin * 2 + 'vw)' ) as ...............
[15:41:49] <momomo> $(window).height() - css.margin * 2 * $(window).width()
[15:41:53] <momomo> but is not working
[15:42:15] <momomo> I also tried:
[15:42:16] <momomo> var h = "" + ($(window).height() - css.margin * 2 * $(window).width()) + "px"; // 'calc(100vh
[15:44:49] <momomo> i think this is it:
[15:44:50] <momomo> var h = $(window).height() - css.margin * 2 * $(window).width()/100 + "px";
[15:47:23] <arup_r> Hi When someone click on the button I want to change the text of the button html, and once ajax completed I want to change the text again back to earlier state. But my attempt is not changing the text to "Updating". What is wrong in my code https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/512f0ca28c910eeec1909d06e84c94a6 ?
[15:58:19] <taplar> input type="button" ?
[15:59:50] <arup_r> yes
[15:59:59] <taplar> those don't have inner html
[16:00:01] <taplar> they have a value
[16:00:10] <taplar> <button> appears to have inner html
[16:01:28] <mikatone> Hi this is only a study example but need a few advices on how to do it better :) http://codepen.io/proudbyte/pen/wWXrvx
[16:01:53] <arup_r> if I remove the .complete()/.done()/.always() function I see the change to "updating" .. but with .complete()/.done()/.always() the value seems getting updated so fast. I can not see it.
[16:02:27] <taplar> and that's bad?
[16:02:36] <taplar> you want your request to finish fast
[16:03:18] <taplar> mikatone: what are you concerned about?
[16:03:31] <mikatone> better programming
[16:04:00] <taplar> are you just wanting critique?
[16:04:07] <mikatone> yes please
[16:04:10] <arup_r> taplar: Ok, I just want to see that it is happening. How can I test it?
[16:04:34] <arup_r> setTimeout(3000, function() {}) failed to show me the change :)
[16:04:42] <arup_r> I just want to test that it happens
[16:04:48] <taplar> arup_r: i mean if you leave out the change back you'd see it happen
[16:04:53] <taplar> test?
[16:05:28] <arup_r> ok let me delay the response in backend to see the change from update -> updating -> update
[16:05:39] <taplar> mikatone: ln 6, 8, you don't have to wrap info. it is already a jquery object
[16:06:48] <taplar> "isChecked" might could be more informative about it's purpose
[16:07:13] <taplar> you also don't have to wrap the 'box' that is passed in.  it also is already a jquery object
[16:07:56] <mikatone> thank you for pointing me that I was quiet sure about it too but comited some mistake and didn't realized
[16:08:48] <taplar> are you ever going to apply this logic to more checkboxes and infos?
[16:09:02] <mikatone> nope only to one
[16:09:21] <taplar> ok, then another thing you could do is surround it in a closure, and then you wouldn't need to pass the box or info around
[16:09:21] <mikatone> but might do do know :)
[16:10:32] <mikatone> wow I guess you mean that both box and info props get their local scope inside the clousure ?
[16:10:44] <taplar> one sec
[16:12:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/65yy8j09/
[16:12:43] <mikatone> checking
[16:12:59] <taplar> just a ruff thing thrown together to show the idea
[16:13:40] <mikatone> taplar nice this avoids global scope pollution i guess right?
[16:13:46] <taplar> that too
[16:14:24] <mikatone> taplar great I missed that too :)
[16:14:57] <taplar> yeah, unless you have a reason not to, always put your stuff in some sort of closure/namespace
[16:16:46] <mikatone> I know that but not to much experience keep forgetting important stuff :(
[16:17:02] <taplar> eh, repetition is the name of the game, :)
[16:17:09] <mikatone> ;)
[16:17:12] <mikatone> taplar but thank you so much for your input
[16:19:52] <mikatone> now advanced stuff :) as you could see I have a function isChecked and call right after load the page to garante that all should works
[16:20:37] <mikatone> then the same function gets called on change
[16:20:55] <mikatone> Is there any smarter way of doing this?
[16:21:15] <mikatone> I guess not but it worth asking :)
[16:21:23] <taplar> the smartest way would be to have the markup start out in the good state already, so you don't have to change it with javascript at all
[16:21:54] <taplar> but if you do, how you did it is good.  your calling the method directly instead of trying to delegate the call through the dom.
[16:22:04] <mikatone> I thought about it but every post request the info field gets disabled
[16:23:02] <taplar> but when they first come to the page, is the checkbox ever checked?
[16:23:15] <mikatone> nope
[16:23:23] <taplar> is the other box disabled by default?
[16:23:32] <mikatone> nope
[16:23:33] <mikatone> but after check the first time
[16:23:39] <taplar> so why not default it?
[16:23:47] <taplar> you know the checkbox is never going to start off checked
[16:24:43] <mikatone> because every time i reload the page it will be disabled and only after the js runs
[16:25:03] <mikatone> gets enabled if the case
[16:25:26] <mikatone> getting anything from that thought
[16:25:56] <taplar> i'm not understanding when you would (re)load the page and it would not start off enabled
[16:27:09] <mikatone> testing :)
[16:27:15] <taplar> ?
[16:27:34] <mikatone> anyway pretty happy with solution :)
[16:27:40] <mikatone> dinner time
[16:28:01] <mikatone> thank you taplar
[16:28:07] <taplar> sure
[17:10:01] <klow> Hey pals.. anyone mind helping me with 1 question ? Say I have some .getjson data:  http://pastebin.com/Se3TTMXa
[17:10:19] <klow> its a list of "users"  .. how would I populate a table with that data using jquery?
[17:10:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .map()
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> no need for any jquery except for maybe the final append.
[17:11:20] <klow> OK. Iooking at jQuery for the first time ever as you can probably tell,  I'm more of a back-end guy , and a novice programmer at that. I am complete control over the API since I am coding it, and want to my a SPA  that uses only JSON data to the service I  wrote
[17:11:34] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> but no need to use jquery for the transform to html.
[17:12:29] <klow> jquery is handy to get the json though, right?  its going to need to get it from https://server.com/ListUsers  for example
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, all the ajax methods are awesome.
[17:13:06] <klow> ya so Im making a CRUD app if you will , but im trying to steer away from any big frameworks for starters if I can
[17:13:14] <robertmaxrees> ... sure?
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> none of that changes literally anything I've said :)
[17:13:45] <klow> just thinking out loud
[17:13:55] <klow> you know angular as well?
[17:14:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with it.  much more familiar with backbone and a bit more with react.
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> angular is too java-y for my tastes.
[17:15:05] <klow> gotcha. just thinking ahead if I end up able to make a real drag+drop style webUI for managing this data
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> also: i might start learning to camelcase things like data.
[17:15:20] <robertmaxrees> and i'd avoid angular personally.  lots of other great options.
[17:15:46] <robertmaxrees> either way, for the freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/yLwcr2w2/
[17:15:50] <taplar> framework is a little much for drag and drop
[17:16:01] <taplar> if that's all your after
[17:16:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah but he'll want some kind of model, templating, etc.
[17:51:30] <acidjazz> yea angular is not good for learning
[17:51:35] <acidjazz> or optimizing
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> or using.
[17:51:54] <acidjazz> angular is perfect for getting something done w/out konwledge of what it does for someone you care nothign about
[17:52:13] <taplar> like money
[18:06:06] <taplar> sorry.  too real
[20:16:08] <neilpdx> hi
[20:16:12] <neilpdx> from portland
[20:16:16] <robertmaxrees> hello
[20:16:17] <robertmaxrees> from chico
[20:16:34] <neilpdx> nice to meet you.  do you know jquery really well robert?
[20:16:41] <robertmaxrees> i do in fact.
[20:16:50] <robertmaxrees> as so many other folks in this channel.
[20:17:03] <robertmaxrees> if you have any questions, go ahead and toss them out.  anybody that can help you will do so.
[20:17:50] <neilpdx> fantastic.  it looks like, based on trial and error, that when i use $(document).ready( function() {
[20:17:57] <neilpdx> all the variables that i use inside that ready
[20:18:06] <neilpdx> need to be declared before the start of that function.
[20:18:12] <neilpdx> my question is
[20:18:32] <neilpdx> isn't this supposed to run after the rest of the code in the <script> tag?
[20:18:35] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're confused about javascript scoping rules.
[20:18:38] <robertmaxrees> and not necessarily.
[20:18:39] <neilpdx> yeah
[20:19:40] <neilpdx> i'm getting by , by declaring empty variables before the ready function.
[20:19:55] <neilpdx> but, i would prefer to understand why
[20:19:56] <robertmaxrees> so the document ready theoretically should run after, yes, but you should really be avoiding variable declarations like that.
[20:20:32] <robertmaxrees> and it's because of scoping, which has nothing to do with jquery and everything to do with javascript - variables declared inside of a function only exist inside that function's scope.
[20:20:38] <robertmaxrees> they don't exist outside.
[20:21:21] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't really be trying to access them outside of the document ready though.  can you share some examplke code in a jsfiddle or a gist or something?
[20:21:28] <neilpdx> right, how about global variables declared after the ready?  i'm finding that they don't work inside the ready
[20:21:41] <neilpdx> yes
[20:21:45] <robertmaxrees> you should need to be doing any of that :)\
[20:21:57] <robertmaxrees> *shouldn't.
[20:22:33] <neilpdx> http://205.186.150.182/correlation2.html
[20:22:39] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[20:22:43] <robertmaxrees> can you maybe make a fiddle instead?
[20:22:54] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[20:23:00] <robertmaxrees> alright - let's start with some basics :)
[20:23:14] <neilpdx> i'm checking out fiddle now
[20:23:52] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you don't want to ever use global variables.
[20:24:34] <robertmaxrees> luckily, you can get around that by using an IIFE - wrap all your code in (function() { /* your code here */ }());
[20:25:12] <neilpdx> i see
[20:25:14] <robertmaxrees> next, some of the variables change based on event handlers.
[20:25:15] <neilpdx> here's the fiddle
[20:25:21] <neilpdx> https://jsfiddle.net/8g6c1a2e/
[20:25:29] <neilpdx> i see
[20:25:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of using global vars for that, look at the element instead and read the property.
[20:26:04] <neilpdx> so i've got to fix the variable definitions.     ok.
[20:26:15] <neilpdx> Neat.  i'm learning
[20:26:31] <robertmaxrees> right - and then instead of doing things like inputChartobj.update(); you should pass the new value.
[20:26:59] <neilpdx> right.  then the chart will update automatically without having to call that function.
[20:27:14] <robertmaxrees> err, no.
[20:27:18] <neilpdx> ok
[20:27:18] <robertmaxrees> you still need to call that function.
[20:27:27] <neilpdx> i see
[20:27:29] <robertmaxrees> you just change it to accept an argument.
[20:27:42] <robertmaxrees> basically, global state vars are a bad thing.  pass data to functions instead.
[20:28:12] <neilpdx> hmmm that function is from ChartJS so i don't know how to do that, but, still, i'm definitely understanding more than i did before.
[20:28:34] <neilpdx> since you're already looking at the code, would you mind also looking into why the jquery UI stuff is not working?
[20:28:51] <neilpdx> it does not pick up any of the theme that i've put in.
[20:29:23] <robertmaxrees> ah, sounds like you need to instead directly set things in the document and then run inputChartobj.update();.
[20:30:02] <robertmaxrees> "it does not pick up any of the theme that i've put in." could you clarify?
[20:30:21] <robertmaxrees> also: you have an error in your console, which will cause other things to break.
[20:30:29] <neilpdx> right.  i can see based on what you said, that this is the reason that the chart never gets updated even though the global variable that i created does get updated on the click events.
[20:30:45] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your console?
[20:30:49] <robertmaxrees> your js console, i mean.
[20:30:55] <neilpdx> down at the bottom, all the buttons in the radio button set, they are supposed to be styled based on a jquery UI that i downloaded and installed into the site.
[20:31:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, fix the js errors first.
[20:31:06] <neilpdx> yeah, i saw some touch errors, but i assumed those are not relevant.
[20:31:08] <robertmaxrees> then address that.
[20:31:10] <neilpdx> right
[20:31:12] <robertmaxrees> "ReferenceError: availableTags is not defined
[20:31:12] <robertmaxrees> [Learn More]
[20:31:12] <neilpdx> i will
[20:31:20] <robertmaxrees> this can prevent jqui from working correctly.
[20:31:25] <neilpdx> really.
[20:31:33] <robertmaxrees> it needs to initialize using js, yes.
[20:31:34] <neilpdx> i'll have to find out why it's not there.
[20:31:53] <neilpdx> robert this is tremendous help .  i thank you
[20:32:02] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.  have you considered doing any tutorials?
[20:32:08] <robertmaxrees> like running through learn.jquery.com ?
[20:32:22] <neilpdx> well that's how i got this far.... i have not tried that one.  i will do that now.
[21:11:42] <G66K> hello everyone
[21:11:47] <robertmaxrees> good evening.
[21:13:01] <G66K> im having a little problem right here
[21:13:02] <G66K> http://pastebin.com/0VPawnPi
[21:13:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[21:13:39] <G66K> im trying to hide the last clickable
[21:13:42] <robertmaxrees> other than your code not making sense :)
[21:14:05] <robertmaxrees> .val("active",true) ?
[21:14:07] <G66K> robertmaxrees: its suppose to hide and show a list
[21:14:11] <robertmaxrees> that's that trying to do?
[21:14:34] <robertmaxrees> try this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d91q2ud6/ - add your html and js in here.  maybe we can figure it out a little better that way.
[21:14:38] <G66K> robertmaxrees: its checking if last clickable has active status
[21:14:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not what .val() is for :)

[21:17:29] <robertmaxrees> alright, so .val() - are you trying to set a class or something there?
[21:18:26] <robertmaxrees> i ask because .val() is for setting various form input values.
[21:18:59] <G66K> robertmaxrees: so basicly when you click in the coffe its show you the hidden item
[21:19:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[21:19:26] <G66K> what im trying to do is to hide the previous items when i click on milk
[21:19:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand why you did what you did to help you understand where you went wrong ;)
[21:20:43] <G66K> robertmaxrees: i was trying to set an action to true to previous items
[21:20:51] <robertmaxrees> "action"?
[21:21:08] <robertmaxrees> normally we use classes for things like that - i'll show you one way to approach this.
[21:21:22] <G66K> alright that may help

[21:22:52] <robertmaxrees> you could also make that just https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d91q2ud6/3/
[21:23:18] <robertmaxrees> but basically, you never use .val() for anything other than setting input values.  for stuff like this, use classes.
[21:24:45] <G66K> robertmaxrees: thats awesome
[21:24:56] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[21:25:04] <G66K> im still new to jquery its my second day
[21:25:14] <robertmaxrees> also: have you checked out learn.jquery.com?
[21:25:16] <G66K> robertmaxrees: sure i do thanks
[21:25:26] <G66K> i was using ws3school lately
[21:25:29] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[21:25:33] <robertmaxrees> avoid w3schools
[21:26:06] <G66K> robertmaxrees: ok i will move to the link you suggest
[21:26:35] <robertmaxrees> at least for jquery, use the link i suggested.  https://www.codecademy.com/ is another solid resource.
[21:26:45] <robertmaxrees> w3schools has some problems they still need to address.
[21:28:17] <G66K> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot
[21:28:23] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
