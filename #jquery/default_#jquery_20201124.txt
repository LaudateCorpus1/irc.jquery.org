[08:36:17] <lintguy> What is the path for jquery when it's been loaded with $.ready() ?
[08:37:12] <lintguy> I'm trying to traverse to jquery in a console where it has loaded, but I'm unable to find it.
[08:38:41] <lintguy> For example, if i do $(document).ready(function () { function myCustomFunction() { alert('hello') } }); How do i navigate to myCustomFunction() from the console?
[09:41:18] <lintguy> Ok, so it's an anonymous function that's why I didn't see it
[21:23:09] <z1haze> i have this jquery plugin and i need to modify it at runtime, to overwrite the initialize function .. with the way this is written, is it possible? https://bpa.st/E53Q
[21:24:46] <robertmaxrees> z1haze backing up - why are you trying to overwrite it?
[21:24:56] <robertmaxrees> is it your own plugin?
[21:25:20] <z1haze> no, not at all
[21:25:29] <z1haze> its part of a reference application that we build from
[21:25:50] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah, there's not really a way to modify the initialize before the code "loads"
[21:25:52] <z1haze> salesforce puts out a 'basic reference application' that is used as a base for a clients website
[21:25:56] <z1haze> darn
[21:26:05] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[21:26:10] <z1haze> im trying to avoid copy pasting tons of stuff as much as possible
[21:26:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't even go there with SF.
[21:26:30] <z1haze> but there's always a couple little crazy things in there that need fixing, and we have to like copy damn near everything to fix it
[21:26:31] <robertmaxrees> either re-do it yourself or don't.  but don't try to modify what they give you.
[21:26:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's a reason for that.
[21:27:11] <z1haze> yeah, to make matters worse, lots of third party vendors use this reference applications to build their integrations on top of, and none of them follow theprocess correctly
[21:27:32] <z1haze> visa/cybersource, a massive company delivered a giant ball of crap, and yeah
[21:27:37] <z1haze> alright, well thank you
[21:27:54] <robertmaxrees> hah, we work with cybersource :)
[21:28:02] <z1haze> they're a sh*t show
[21:28:09] <z1haze> do you have access to SF repos?
[21:28:11] <z1haze> on github
[21:28:12] <robertmaxrees> nah, they're actually not that bad in my experience.
[21:28:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't.  we don't touch the SF client-side stuff.
[21:28:27] <z1haze> you should their work on this platform :D
[21:28:30] <robertmaxrees> because we have out own frontend.
[21:28:37] <robertmaxrees> *our
[21:28:38] <robertmaxrees> nah ;)
[21:29:07] <z1haze> for some reason, their approach to these websites is completely awful. they build like a cookie cutter ref app, which isnt even good
[21:29:23] <z1haze> and then vendors build integrations based on that, and they dont work most of the time, and then we have to figure out how to make it all work
[21:29:38] <z1haze> whatever happened to just creating an api and letting people build their own implementation
[21:29:48] <robertmaxrees> oh i'm familiar - i had to hack some workarounds with their liveagent widget or whatever they call it these days.
[21:30:07] <robertmaxrees> so oddly enough, they provide those APIs.
[21:30:25] <robertmaxrees> but people are lazy and see drop-on, turnkey and think that's what they want.
[21:43:17] <z1haze> yeah, but virtually no one in this field approaches these builds from a completely custom perspective
[21:43:21] <z1haze> and it just blows my mind
[21:43:32] <robertmaxrees> we are :)
[21:43:54] <z1haze> no i mean my particular niche
[21:43:58] <robertmaxrees> ah gotcha.
[21:44:13] <z1haze> like literally every single 'salesforce commerce cloud' website that ive ever seen, and ive seen a ton
[21:44:45] <z1haze> and im talking like major companies, the biggest in the world use this platform, and none of them approach it from a custom angle
[21:45:56] <z1haze> the place im working for now, we are an integrator. and because they know that the reference application is a ball of crap, they've spent i think the better part of a year taking the reference application, and then building on top of it, extending and replacing certain pieces of it, so its more turn key and whatever.. but still.. they use this stupid reference application as the base for everything.
[21:46:40] <z1haze> if they just spent the time and made a full site from scratch it might take a little longer but you'd have a 100x better result, and way more maintainable
[21:48:07] <z1haze> ok, i digress
[21:51:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[23:09:12] <errorous> hello. what would be to listen for changes on an element, so that, on change, current change is disregarded if another change on the same element happens within a certain period of time
[23:09:39] <robertmaxrees> "changes" as in the change/input event?
[23:10:01] <errorous> robertmaxrees yeah, as in, .on(  'change')
[23:10:17] <robertmaxrees> you want a debounced event handler.
[23:10:24] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[23:10:28] <errorous> thanks, let me look up
[23:12:39] <robertmaxrees> fwiw depending on the element you probably want to listen to the 'input' event instead.
[23:12:48] <errorous> robertmaxrees yeah, that's pretty much it, thanks again
[23:13:04] <robertmaxrees> rad.
