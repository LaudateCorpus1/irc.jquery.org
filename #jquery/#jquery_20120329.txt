[00:02:00] <Xotix> Cork i got it, at least in ie9…Too tires. parent.window.postMessage isn't allowed in IE but window.top is. at least ie9. But need to test it a bit further… Sometimes i could kill myself, anyway, dddbmt didn't want to flame on you. (wasn't meant like  that) and cork, is it possible that jQuery draggable has problems with appendTo in ie8?
[00:02:37] <dddbmt> Xotix, no worries. I probably misunderstood your question anyway ;)
[00:02:37] <Cork> Xotix: uh.. parent.window.postMessage??
[00:02:57] <Cork> Xotix: postMessage is used on the corrent page
[00:03:05] <Cork> and you give the url of the target site
[00:03:48] <Xotix> otherWindow.postMessage(message, targetOrigin);    did i missunderstand that?
[00:03:55] <Cork> yes
[00:04:07] <Cork> Xotix: site1: so window.postMessage('message', 'site2.xx.com');
[00:04:28] <Cork> site2: window.onMessage = function() {}
[00:04:43] <Cork> or rather $(window).bind('message')
[00:04:46] <Xotix> I'm doing postMessage within the iframe. I have to postMessage it to the window on which i want to catch it, don't i?
[00:04:49] <Xotix> window.postMessage, when called, causes a https://developer.mozilla.org/en/MessageEvent to be dispatched at the target window
[00:05:10] <Cork> yes
[00:05:23] <Cork> the target window is the url in the second attribute
[00:05:31] <Cork> you run postMessage localy
[00:05:56] <Lonestar99> can i call a function within a funcion? -->  $("#bb,#pv,#nx,#lg").click(function(stt) { ..  function BaSCall(stt) {  ... }  ...  }  ??
[00:06:49] <Xotix> If i do window.postMessage() within the iframe and $().bind(message) within the parent page, the parent page's eventListener never gets anything to listen on. I have to post the message to the window on which I'm listening. right? So why's parent.window wrong?
[00:07:01] <Cork> Xotix: hmm wierd that page doesn't say the same as what i've been using before >_>
[00:07:27] <Cork> Xotix: it might have been changed in html5 specs...
[00:07:32] <Cork> let me look into it a bit
[00:08:11] <Xotix> The parameter you are saying is just the what it should allow to post on or which domain is able to receive.
[00:08:18] <Xotix> at least, i've read it like that.
[00:12:56] <Cork> Xotix: ah theres another problem, that might be the problem
[00:13:11] <Cork> Xotix: parent is the window object it doens't have a window mmember
[00:13:17] <Cork> member
[00:14:14] <Xotix> Cork, ah, nice. Thanks for that info.
[00:16:20] <Xotix> It works with window.top now :) But another question. if you go to http://tinyw.in/BLrg within ie8, just ie8. Ie9 with compability mode also works. If you click on show at newsletter 313 and the hover over the blue bar and drag something, you see that it seems appendTo : 'body' fails in ie8. Sadly, I'm not receiving any errors. You got an idea, why this fails?
[00:16:52] <tommyd> Hi all! I experienced a small nuisance today when I tried to add a Javascript file dynamically to my page
[00:17:51] <tommyd> I'm doing something along the line $('script').attr('src', '...').appendTo($('head'))
[00:18:27] <tommyd> while the script file is loaded and executed (apparently) - which I can see in WebKit's resource view - it is not actually added as tag in the HTML head
[00:18:44] <Cork> tommyd: are you sure you mean $('script') and not $('<script/>') ?
[00:18:49] <tommyd> which in unfortunate, because the script therefor doesn't popup in the Scripts tab of the web inspector
[00:19:03] <tommyd> Cork: actually, I meant <script />, sorry
[00:19:32] <gnarf> no need for the /
[00:19:42] <gnarf> also you can't actually close script tags that way just fyi :)
[00:20:02] <tommyd> so I stumbled upon jQ's getScript() method that is apparently used to dynamically load scripts
[00:20:07] <Cork> tommyd: i think browsers filter out script tags added dynamically
[00:20:22] <Cork> i have a vage memory about that, but not completly sure
[00:20:51] <tommyd> Cork: I don't think so, because in my GMaps integration Google also adds (visible) script tags to the head of my doc dynamically
[00:21:13] <gnarf> ?getScript
[00:21:13] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[00:22:02] <tommyd> it seems to be as if jQuery uses this method internally whenever it sees a <script> file being dynamically added to the page
[00:23:47] <tommyd> I mean this is all super and nice for deployment, but sucks for development
[00:28:09] <Xotix> I'm having problems with draggables in ie8. Seems like the option appendTo : 'body' doesn't work. Demo: http://tinyw.in/BLrg click show at newsletter 313. Hover over the blue bar and drag something. Any idea?
[00:28:35] <Cork> Xotix: you prob need to track it down to where it fails
[00:30:58] <gnarf> Xotix: i'd look if i wasn't on my way to bed and not feeling like browserstack debugging
[00:31:17] <gnarf> Xotix: but make sure you're using newest jQuery and jQuery UI versions first
[00:32:12] <gnarf> Xotix: and if you can't find anything about it - perhaps submit a bug on bugs.jqueryui.com - but do a little research and make a more "reduced" test case on say http://jsfiddle.com
[00:33:02] <Xotix> gnarf, no problem, I'm using nearly the newest. 1.8.16 of 1.8.18. gnarf, of course. Don't think it is a bug in jQuery thanks
[00:36:07] <Xotix> gnarf gn8 ;)
[00:37:40] <pif> hi, what is the best jq file upload widget?
[00:40:00] <gnarf> Xotix: reduced test case is a great place to start - you'll solve the issue yourself if you keep adding shit til it breaks
[00:40:01] <gnarf> :)
[00:40:20] <Guest72072> hey guys i have one question
[00:40:41] <Guest72072> what would be best jquery countdown mod
[00:40:48] <Guest72072> for coupon website like
[00:41:10] <gnarf> pif: i personally like plupload - although its not specifically jQuery
[00:41:13] <Guest72072> there would be multi counters on site.... and i am trying to achive that scrolling wont lag
[00:42:01] <gnarf> Guest72072: most people using jQuery don't need to write a countdown plugin, or ever use one... TBH I don't think I've ever seen one --- however google could probably solve this question for you
[00:42:16] <gnarf> ?lmgtfy jquery countdown timer plugin
[00:42:16] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+countdown+timer+plugin
[00:42:24] <gnarf> ^^^ @Guest72072
[00:42:30] <Guest72072> i tester most of them but all lags while scrolling site
[00:42:35] <Guest72072> tested*
[00:42:57] <Guest72072> when there is couple of timers at same time added
[00:43:03] <Guest72072> groupon kinda solved that
[00:43:06] <Guest72072> but cant find out how
[00:44:00] <Cork> Guest72072: sounds like the one you've tested doesn't use Date
[00:44:26] <Cork> Guest72072: you need to use the Date object to get the time change, as you can't count on the step size of timers
[00:44:28] <Guest72072> ofcourse it does
[00:44:42] <Guest72072> it worked but laged allways when seconds moved
[00:45:02] <Guest72072> while i was scrolling to the bottom of website i noticed the lagged movement due to those counters
[00:45:11] <Cork> you mean the update rate staggers?
[00:45:19] <Cork> or the scroll jumps?
[00:45:32] <talin> i want to make a button that insert text into some <input type="text"> boxes when i click it
[00:46:12] <Guest72072> scrolling is slowed/lagged thats best way to describe it :)
[00:46:26] <Guest72072> if i remove counters scroling is just fine
[00:47:02] <Cork> Guest72072: have you tried using animationFrame for the counter?
[00:47:19] <Guest72072> hum never heard of it
[00:47:24] <Guest72072> will google about that
[00:47:34] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame
[00:48:06] <Cork> that should reduce the amount of work the browser needs to do
[00:49:03] <Guest72072> humm not all browsers are supported :/
[00:49:08] <Guest72072> will try anyway
[00:49:30] <Cork> nope, but you can fallback to normal setInterval/setTimeout with almost the same structure
[00:50:05] <Guest72072> allright got it
[00:50:08] <Guest72072> presiate for your help
[00:50:47] <Cork> resuest animation frame was intentionally constructed to make it easy to fallback to normal timer events
[00:51:57] <Guest72072> yup seems to be good but never heard of it cool
[00:52:10] <beasty> mornings Cork
[00:52:23] <Cork> Guest72072: no garantee it will remove the lag though
[00:52:38] <Cork> beasty: morning
[00:55:59] <Xotix> Cork: My draggable failes in IE8, because i use .hide() on start: In other browser, this doesn't affect the draggable probably because it gets appended to the body.  The dragging itself works so the appendTo also works. Any idea how i can make hide() not affect the draggable?
[00:56:40] <Cork> Xotix: ie is a bit picky about hidden elements
[00:56:59] <Cork> you could try append it first and hide it afterwards
[00:57:47] <talin> i want to make a button that does something when i click it. how can i do that?
[00:58:04] <Xotix> How do you mean, append it first?
[00:58:07] <Cork> talin: bind a click event on it
[00:58:16] <talin> Cork: based on its name=?
[00:58:38] <talin> Cork: should it have type="submit"?
[00:58:39] <Cork> talin: depends on what you use to create the button, and how you want to select it
[00:58:55] <Cork> talin: if you just want a button, and not a form element use <button></button>
[00:59:07] <talin> Cork: i have a button that i made with <input type="submit" name="buttomofdoom">
[00:59:26] <Cork> that should be for submitting forms
[00:59:30] <talin> ah
[00:59:48] <imanc> anyone know how can do an case insensitive :contains or something similar?
[01:00:28] <Cork> imanc: you would have to do the same as :contains but run toLowserCase() first
[01:01:02] <imanc> Cork: yeh, bummer. I'm basically using it to find elemnts. I guess I'll have to iterate over each element and check
[01:01:45] <Cork> $('selector').filter(function() { return $(this).text().toLowerCase() === '' });
[01:02:07] <Cork> imanc: :contains does => $('selector').filter(function() { return $(this).text() === '' });
[01:02:14] <Cork> thats why its so slow
[01:02:20] <imanc> aha
[01:06:54] <Lonestar99> is there an opposite to .click() ?? like disable  click of div?
[01:07:23] <Cork> Lonestar99: no
[01:07:34] <Cork> use .data and an if case in your event handler
[01:07:45] <talin> Cork: with <button> it worked. thank you
[01:08:22] <Lonestar99> Cork:  thanks,  will do that
[01:08:24] <Cork> $('something').click(function() { if($(this).data('disabled')) { return; } }); $('something').data('disabled', true);
[01:08:41] <Cork> and $('something').removeData('disabled');
[01:08:46] <Lonestar99> ok very cool thanks
[01:09:34] <Lonestar99> worked on a home brewed pagination system, now just need to disable the grey buttons from click...
[01:12:15] <Lonestar99> thanks for your help

[01:27:46] <Flo0815> but i think it's not jQuery, it's the browsers grafic for resizable elements

[01:27:56] <johnnny22> probably
[01:30:30] <Gaia> hey guys im using jQuery mobile, but with my page transitions it does something strange on my android phone
[01:30:34] <Gaia> wich shouldnt happen
[01:30:41] <Gaia> anyone here has an android?
[01:31:01] <Gaia> I got a demo page, but the header keeps flickering
[01:31:08] <Gaia> on the page transition
[01:42:29] <lampe2> hey i wanne make a popup after i scrolled about 20% the page and make it disapear after 25% of the page is there a way in jquery ?
[01:43:06] <Cork> lampe2: use the scroll event and check document.scrollTop
[01:43:11] <Cork> sorry window.scrollTop
[01:43:24] <lampe2> ahhhha okay thx Corey
[01:43:30] <lampe2> ehhe Cork i mean
[01:43:35] <Cork> :D
[01:43:50] <lampe2> this was TAB aoutcomplete....
[01:43:57] <Cork> i know
[01:45:00] <lampe2> ahhhh this is very nice :D
[01:48:20] <henn1nk> ttp://ix.io/2fT/js i am trying to create a slidebox with active select buttons.... the slideshow runs fine, but i have no idea how to implement the buttons
[01:48:29] <henn1nk> http://ix.io/2fT/js
[01:52:54] <velocitykendal> Hi guys, I'm struggling with a line of code where I'm trying to traverse the DOM to a specific anchor with a hash value matched with one stored in a cookie....
[01:52:58] <velocitykendal> jQuery("ul.menu li a").filter( jQuery(this).attr("href") == cookie_set ).parent().css("border", "3px double red");
[01:53:14] <velocitykendal> That doesn't work, can anyone see some obvious faults?
[01:53:53] <Cork> velocitykendal: jQuery(this).attr("href") == cookie_set needs to be in a function
[01:54:18] <Cork> jQuery("ul.menu li a").filter(function() { return jQuery(this).attr("href") == cookie_set; })
[01:54:29] <Cork> jQuery("ul.menu li a").filter(function() { return jQuery(this).attr("href") === cookie_set; }) even
[01:55:38] <velocitykendal> Cork: thanks. What's the === for?
[01:55:49] <Cork> ?eval "1" == 1
[01:55:50] <bot-t> Cork: true
[01:55:52] <Cork> ?eval "1" === 1
[01:55:52] <bot-t> Cork: false
[01:56:05] <Cork> its a more precise comparison
[01:56:09] <Cork> and a faster one
[01:57:16] <velocitykendal> So I've potentially narrowed it down to one <a> tag, how would I apply a class to that?
[01:57:35] <Cork> .addClass
[01:57:35] <velocitykendal> stick it on the end?
[01:57:44] <Cork> before .parent()
[01:58:14] <Cork> (if you want to set the class on the a tag that is)
[01:59:10] <anli_> Is there a way to make tabs inside tabs prettier?
[01:59:32] <Cork> prittier?
[01:59:39] <Cork> you mean the size?
[01:59:59] <anli_> It doesnt look very nice with a tab pane inside another tab pane
[02:00:06] <velocitykendal> Cork: thanks, it's working, thing is my cookie isn't working properly now :P
[02:00:11] <velocitykendal> ...but cheers!
[02:05:42] <anli_> Maybe having an inner tabpane without borders would be something
[02:05:54] <anli_> Just labels would be great
[02:31:47] <jh1> hi there. Is it possible to have an "or" like iframe[src*="youtube|vimeo"] in a selector?
[02:34:38] <Cork> no
[02:35:07] <Cork> $('iframe[src*="youtube"], iframe[src*="vimeo"]')
[02:44:47] <Xotix> Cork, couldn't figure out my IE8 draggable hidden problem. Any hint i should go about it?
[02:53:32] <Cork> Xotix: and hiding it after you've appended it dosn't help?
[02:53:48] <henn1nk> $(window).on is not a function ... what to do? :(
[02:54:09] <Cork> henn1nk: sounds like you haven't loaded jquery
[02:54:13] <Cork> or $ is overwritten
[02:54:41] <Cork> oh or your jquery version is < then 1.7
[02:54:52] <henn1nk> ah
[02:55:35] <SionEngine> hi
[02:55:37] <SionEngine> salut
[02:56:24] <Xotix> Cork, I'm first initialising the draggable with the option appendTo : body; later on i visibility: hidden; the container. on hover on the handler i do show() so it slides out and on start drag i do hide() so it goes back. And this hide() causes the problem.
[02:57:18] <Cork> Xotix: ah... hide doesn't set visibility
[02:57:33] <Cork> Xotix: you might want to use animate instead
[03:01:34] <henn1nk> Cork: doesn't help
[03:03:19] <henn1nk> Cork: oh did help
[03:03:21] <henn1nk> :PO
[03:04:14] <velocitykendal> jQuery('ul.menu a').click(function () {
[03:04:14] <velocitykendal> 		var tab_hash = jQuery(this).attr('href');
[03:04:14] <velocitykendal> 		jQuery.cookie('tab_select', tab_hash);
[03:04:14] <velocitykendal> 		console.log(jQuery.cookie('tab_select'));
[03:04:14] <velocitykendal> 	});
[03:04:33] <velocitykendal> in the log the same hash value keeps appearing on every click
[03:05:11] <theCole> velocitykendal: post this in paste bin
[03:05:15] <theCole> vs in the irc client
[03:05:16] <theCole> please
[03:05:23] <velocitykendal> sorry
[03:05:24] <theCole> makes for easier reading
[03:05:26] <velocitykendal> new to this
[03:05:31] <theCole> velocitykendal: it's cool
[03:05:37] <velocitykendal> how do I use a paste bin?
[03:05:37] <theCole> velocitykendal: have you ever used jsbin?
[03:05:40] <theCole> i mean
[03:05:42] <theCole> jsfiddle
[03:05:46] <velocitykendal> nope
[03:05:51] <theCole> velocitykendal: oh man
[03:05:53] <theCole> you are in for a treat
[03:05:56] <theCole> jsfiddle.net
[03:05:57] <theCole> check it out
[03:06:01] <velocitykendal> oooooooooooh
[03:06:19] <theCole> put your html in one area
[03:06:25] <theCole> css and js in antoher
[03:06:27] <theCole> and then run it
[03:06:30] <theCole> then paste the link here
[03:07:27] <velocitykendal> like... OMG
[03:07:28] <Xotix> Cork, visibility is not the bad thing, The bad thing is hide(); i remembered using animate which caused some problems. But i'll try again
[03:10:38] <velocitykendal> umm
[03:11:01] <velocitykendal> that don't got jquery.cookie.js
[03:12:07] <henn1nk> Cork: another problem: this.$thumbs.eq(pos).position() is null
[03:12:21] <velocitykendal> well... nonetheless, this is what I'm working with http://jsfiddle.net/PUV6T/
[03:12:53] <velocitykendal> when you click on an anchor tag it stores the hash value in a cookie
[03:13:48] <velocitykendal> but when looking at the log the same value keeps being returned
[03:14:00] <velocitykendal> (from the cookie)
[03:14:33] <velocitykendal> if I log the var containing the hash value from the click then it updates accordingly
[03:14:57] <velocitykendal> i.e. the cookie isn't being updated
[03:15:05] <velocitykendal> can't see why?
[03:17:05] <Xotix> What's the possibilities for the easing parameter of animate?
[03:17:09] <Xotix> *are
[03:22:18] <GiUmaTo> hello everyone. First time here. Here's my question: is bugs.jquery.com site supposed to work? 'cause it's not working for me.
[03:22:36] <Xotix> Cork what easing function should i use?
[03:26:43] <Xotix> Cork thanks i think I'm on the correct way :)
[03:28:46] <juho3> If I have a fixed size div centered on a page, is there some way to calculate how many pixels is between the edge of the page and the side of the div?
[03:31:59] <frugalfirbolg> juho3: are you using auto for margins on that div?
[03:32:27] <juho3> frugalfirbolg, yes
[03:33:01] <juho3> i figured i could just find the width of the page and subtract the width of the element from that and divide that by two :)
[03:33:04] <juho3> that would probably work
[03:33:23] <frugalfirbolg> right, as long as nothing else is on either side of that div
[03:33:35] <juho3> no it's a container div
[03:44:12] <Xotix> i have $('#elementsContainer').animate({'width' : '0px'}, 250, null, function() this works. But how do i do the opposite?
[03:44:28] <arphen> anyone got an idea how to make jquerymobile NOT go fullscreen
[03:50:47] <JaredCE> hi all, i have some code that highlights an element when you pass it an id, which is fine, but i want to highlight elements below it too till a certain point
[03:52:00] <JaredCE> my html looks a little like: <p id="pp1">bla</p><p>stuff</p><p id="pp2"><p>blah</p><p>more</p><p id="pp33"> etc
[03:52:35] <JaredCE> so if i pass in pp1, i want to highlight the <p> tags below it till it reaches pp2
[03:54:56] <Xotix> JaredCe my first try would be: I'm note sure if this works but you can get all of this p's. If they have a wrapper e.g. $(wrapper p).each(do highlight and stop if if $(this.attr('id') == pp2)) something like this maybe. But probably there's a much better solution.
[03:57:22] <JaredCE> wrapper?
[03:58:22] <binarious> Hey is it possible to search for an attribute to be greater that a given value? something like div[id:gt(4)] ?
[04:03:03] <Cork> binarym: $('div').filter(function() { return parseInt(this.id, 10) > 4; });
[04:03:10] <Cork> *binarious
[04:03:33] <binarious> Cork: Ah yes, thank you!
[04:05:41] <Gaia> Hey guys, im looking for a carousel that supports swiping on smartphones
[04:10:16] <adrianF> hi everybody, i have a litte problem with linking single pages in jquerymobil: if i use a link like /catalog/product.html everything is fine (ajax loading), but if i append some parameters like /catalog/product.html?pid=5&gid=6 the content isnt loaded with ajax but with a full page reload
[04:13:56] <JaredCE> Xotix: I can use nextUntil
[04:14:18] <Gaia>  Hey guys, im looking for a carousel that supports swiping on smartphones

[04:52:26] <eirikb> Hey. What is the best way to achieve cross domain post (no proxy)? I control server (yes I can allow get)
[04:52:27] <MacroMan> How can I pass the variable 'this' down into a child function?
[04:53:20] <MacroMan> The setTimout in this can't act on the 'this' variable: http://pastebin.com/mnfASied
[04:53:20] <Eartz> MacroMan : you can store it in a variable
[04:53:54] <MacroMan> OK. But then how to I pass that variable down into a child function?
[04:54:33] <Xotix> if i do $(id).on('click' function()…); and later on I'm adding a button with that ID, the click event should get fired, shouldn't it?
[04:54:53] <Eartz> MacroMan: ty this : http://pastebin.com/Xs6DXDiD
[04:55:36] <MacroMan> Eartz: That works, thanks
[04:55:42] <Eartz> you're welcome
[04:56:22] <Eartz> Xotix: no it won't work
[04:56:29] <Eartz> but you can use .live() instead
[04:56:47] <eirikb> .live() is deprecated
[04:56:48] <Xotix> Eartz:  no i can't. Live is deprecated, on is the thing.
[04:57:05] <eirikb> Use .on on a higher node and use selector
[04:57:19] <Eartz> sorry I thought you used 'bind', didn't pay attention
[04:57:21] <eirikb> Or bind when markup is injected to dom
[04:57:40] <improwizacja> I need tips can you help me?
[04:57:44] <Xotix> eirikb what do you mean use selector?
[04:58:05] <improwizacja> With menu slideDown SlideUp
[04:58:46] <eirikb> Xotix: $('something').on('click', 'childselector', ...)
[04:58:47] <improwizacja> I need good tutorial or ecsample code how to do slidedown slideUp menu
[04:58:56] <Xotix> eirikb, thats what i did?
[04:59:07] <Xotix> eirikb ah you mean the second param
[04:59:15] <eirikb> Xotix: Yes, so not what you did
[04:59:33] <eirikb> You need a higher element though, jQuery doc use $(document) as example IIRC
[05:00:06] <Xotix> eirikb i thought on takes $() as selector if 2nd param not given. But probably it just listens on $() right? so i could do $(document).on(click, myId, …)?
[05:00:43] <eirikb> If the second parameter is not given it is the same as bind
[05:00:59] <eirikb> bind is alias-ish for on(..., null, ...)
[05:01:23] <Xotix> ah, ok thanks.
[05:01:30] <eirikb> Ref https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L974-L976
[05:02:21] <Xotix> eirikb :) nice
[05:03:04] <nanoc> It seems .on() is giving headaches to more than one, here I got a question related: http://pastebin.com/4AiVyamR
[05:03:31] <aismail_> uirejs
[05:03:49] <Xotix> Oh, it isn't that complicated i propbably. just didn't ready properly.
[05:04:02] <Cork> nanoc: yyou should prob move tr into the selector too
[05:04:03] <nanoc> can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong in my conversion from .live() to .on() ?
[05:04:15] <Cork> nanoc: as tr is most likly added and removed when you update the table
[05:04:47] <eirikb> nanoc: Did you also remove document ready?
[05:05:03] <eirikb> And what Cork said
[05:05:09] <rabbi1> having stuck with jquery.dynamicform. js ... using this plugin and successfully generating dynamic fields, but once i call this function, my asp.net events stops working ...... all the events in the fields will be disabled.... any idea why ?
[05:05:15] <nanoc> Cork: beautiful! :)
[05:05:33] <eirikb> I like $(this).parent().parent().remove(), total madness
[05:05:58] <nanoc> eirikb: what would you suggest? is it bad practice?
[05:06:06] <aismail_> hi guys, I'm using require.js + coffeescript and I want to load two coffeescript files in a given order in my app. how do I use both "cs!" and "order!" prefixes together?
[05:06:14] <Cork> ?.closest @ nanoc
[05:06:14] <bot-t> nanoc, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:06:26] <eirikb> nanoc: I don't know what you want to do, but if you want to remove the table you could just assign that to a variable first
[05:06:26] <nanoc> Cork: do you know why is that? why can't just the input be the selector?
[05:06:50] <Cork> nanoc: the selector is the element you bind the even on
[05:06:59] <nanoc> eirikb: not the table, just the row
[05:07:03] <Cork> nanoc: so if that element is removed, the event listner is gone
[05:07:37] <Cork> nanoc: $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[05:07:39] <Cork> easier to read
[05:07:45] <nanoc> Cork: ah, yes, but I don't care in here, those rows are added dynamically via another button, so I want to remove all the row
[05:08:17] <Cork> nanoc: but do you want the listner to still work?
[05:09:02] <nanoc> Cork: humm... is working fine, I add, take, add, add, take, take, readd...  etc
[05:09:35] <nanoc> have a button to add rows, and this button to take it out
[05:09:39] <Cork> nanoc: uh... then i don't think i really follow what you mean
[05:10:04] <nanoc> I'll try the closes now...
[05:11:01] <nanoc> well, it works fine too, I'll stick with it, thanks both :)
[05:11:56] <Cork> nanoc: the difference is that .parent().parent() doesn't say what element it works on, so you need to look at the dom to see what the code does
[05:12:05] <Cork> nanoc: closest is there by easier to read
[05:12:32] <Cork> and its more robust and you will always find the specified element instead of just going a fixed number of parents up
[05:12:44] <Gaia> hey guys, im looking for a custom scrollbar that scrolls my whole page. anyone has an idea wich one to use? thnx
[05:12:45] <Cork> *robust as
[05:14:45] <nanoc> Cork: thanks, I get it, and I'll prefer it from now on, I'm pretty new to jquery
[05:15:52] <Gaia> anyone? :o
[05:16:29] <Cork> Gaia: you mean that continusly scroll the whole page?
[05:16:36] <Cork> why would you want to do that?
[05:17:20] <Gaia> no
[05:17:41] <Gaia> i got a carousel script on my site, wich is swipe-able on a smartphone from left to right
[05:17:50] <Cork> ah
[05:18:00] <Cork> never seen one
[05:18:01] <Gaia> but now, when i swipe from bottom to top, are the other way around
[05:18:16] <Gaia> it doenst scroll the website, since it select only the carousel
[05:18:42] <Gaia> so now im tryting the put a scrollbar over the wesbsite
[05:18:48] <Gaia> but im not so lucky today
[05:19:05] <Cork> hmm, or maybe i have

[06:16:22] <maltray> Hello guys, is there an event for when the zoom of the page changes?, and also, when the width or the height of the window change
[06:18:23] <Cryp71c> maltray, google "jquery detect page resize"
[06:18:28] <Cryp71c> lots of stuff, including a .resize()
[06:18:56] <maltray> alrite, ill try that.. i looked for something like it but as i dont know anything about ipad...
[06:19:01] <maltray> i wasnt sure if it was right or not
[06:19:44] <maltray> and btw, we are already using resize(), but its not working :/
[06:19:52] <Cryp71c> Ah, thats unfortunate.
[06:20:07] <Cryp71c> This is for something on the ipad?
[06:20:46] <maltray> yeh, its just a website that can be seen on my firefox right now, but we want to be able to watch it on the ipad too
[06:22:41] <maltray> Thing is, that im kinda (actually, totally) lost, cause i dont own an ipad, and on my place of work nobody has one (here), so.. yeh, it just lets me to use the simulator (wich, right know, i dont either have..
[06:30:48] <Flo0815> hey guys, i have a really strange problem. I have a ajax request which delivers a table filled with addresses (dataType: json, but the table is delivered as html) coming from a database. Now, the problem is, that the json is 'null'. I tried it with only one dataset and it's ok. So, my question: is there a limit to the datasize in Ajaxrequests or are there any characters causing this problem?
[06:30:48] <Flo0815> Any help appreciated. thx
[06:37:47] <SeanFallon> HEllo
[06:37:57] <Ahrengot> Working with Deferreds, in particular the .done method, can i pass the this keyword along to the callback in any way?
[06:38:07] <Cryp71c> Flo0815, you probably have a character issue (not to say that there isn't a datasize that you could be exceeding, or may in the future)...but most of the time when things involving json data are broken, its a character issue that's invalidating the json structure.
[06:39:33] <Cryp71c> maltray, in short, there's not going to be a workaround for that. If you're developing something for a platform that isn't available to you, your product is almost never going to work right. Emulators are not perfect.
[06:41:10] <Cryp71c> Furthermore, I have no idea what the javascript support (and thus, how well jquery will actually work) for the ipad safari. AFAIK, it is not the same as normal safari, its optimized for a reduced viewscreen size and other "mobile" related things. Ergo, jquery may not work right on it (hell, some normal javascript may not work very well)
[06:41:31] <jbelcher> General refactoring question: var foo = bar || (obj.length) ? obj.method() : ''; Any ideas on making that a bit prettier?
[06:42:37] <Cryp71c> jbelcher, why is obj.length surrounded by parenthesis...wouldn't it be just fine as bar || obj.length ?
[06:42:52] <jbelcher> sure
[06:42:58] <bobbytek> {} vs. new Object(): {} wins?
[06:43:07] <Cryp71c> jbelcher, in any case, it looks like a well structured (simple) ternary if operator to me.
[06:43:16] <Cryp71c> I wouldn't say it needs prettyfication.
[06:43:38] <maltray> Cryp71c I got an ipad now, and yeh about what you say i know, but i just couldnt test just yet
[06:43:40] <maltray> now i can :D
[06:44:29] <jbelcher> Cryp71c: cool, thanks!
[06:46:46] <faraway> Flo0815: did you validate your json response ?
[06:48:24] <Flo0815> Cryp71c: is there a way to find this character?
[06:49:15] <Flo0815> faraway: how do i do that?
[07:00:09] <BaruchHashem> can someone tell me if my identifiers at the top ar correct pls http://jsfiddle.net/4VWXW/
[07:01:07] <Chris25> Good afternoon, jquery. Does anyone know if I can preserve a function via JSON? I have a JSON-string that is full of functions, but obviously these gives error in the parser, so do I need to calculate the functions and THEN encode it to JSON, or can I preserve the functions and calculate on parse?
[07:01:57] <limpc> meh.  ie9 + box shadows = fail :/
[07:05:43] <feyd> I'm dynamically filling in options for a few selects. I'm having problems when processing a server-side 'save' command of the form as the select fields I fill in javascript are not registering as 'selected', despite actually clicking and selecting a value
[07:10:34] <Andres75> hello
[07:14:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Who else in here is hitting themselves with the keyboards at this point? Almost closing time and closing in to deadline, and tehre are a few illogical bugs that just eludes me >.<
[07:14:56] <AdvoWork> is there something out there for jquery that allows a div to collapse, horizontally?
[07:15:01] <dekl> hi guys, does inertia scroll on iOS devices fire any js event, please?
[07:15:17] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: you can change the width
[07:15:20] <johnkpaul> and animate it if you'd like
[07:17:16] <ChrisTheSorcerer> dekl, I believe that would be scrollstop
[07:18:11] <dekl> ChrisTheSorcerer scrollstop? I need sthg that is being constantly fired while the screen moves...
[07:19:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> scrollstart and scrollstop events are special events... you can read more about them here: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/special-scroll-events-for-jquery/ I don't think there's any built-in functions for it thou
[07:19:20] <AdvoWork> johnkpaul, im trying that, but actually my problem is, ive got divs inside divs, and i'm applying click to the main div, but obv the other divs are inside it so when im clicking them, its also acting. can i make it not include inner divs or something?
[07:20:02] <johnkpaul> are you adding your click handler to every div?
[07:20:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> AdvoWork, if you have ID's on the other divs, use one class for all of them to identify them. Something like class="hideDiv" or something
[07:23:05] <dekl> ChrisTheSorcerer doesnt seem to be fired on inertia scroll. but thanx anyway
[07:23:47] <feyd> can anyone explain why the 'selected' attribute never triggers on dynamically filled select options?
[07:23:55] <ChrisTheSorcerer> dekl, sorry I haven't done anything for IOs yet >.<
[07:24:09] <AdvoWork> johnkpaul, , ChrisTheSorcerer ive basically got <div id="test" class="tag"><div> <div>...</div>...</div></div>  and its firing on any of those divs
[07:24:28] <improwizacja> how to get to the css min-height value?
[07:24:49] <improwizacja> in jquery
[07:24:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> So, all the underlying divs needs to be the class "tag" too, and have the event fire on class "tag" instead of ID "test"
[07:25:17] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: can you show us the code where you are adding the click handlers?
[07:25:20] <johnkpaul> ?css @improwizacja
[07:25:21] <bot-t> improwizacja, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[07:25:50] <improwizacja> wchat is name of property for min-height in css
[07:26:01] <improwizacja> in jquery
[07:26:03] <improwizacja> sory
[07:26:22] <ChrisTheSorcerer> style.min-height I think
[07:26:34] <johnkpaul> ChrisTheSorcerer: if you're going to use the stle obj, it has to be camel case
[07:26:35] <feyd> i believe .css('minHeight')
[07:26:43] <improwizacja> thx feyd
[07:26:48] <johnkpaul> in jQuery's css, I think it works with both formats
[07:26:51] <johnkpaul> camel case or hyphenated
[07:26:51] <feyd> in both jquery and javascript it's camel case
[07:26:56] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[07:27:14] <feyd> johnkpaul: you may be right, i dont remember hyphens working when i tried it, but it was a while ago
[07:27:16] <improwizacja> ah!
[07:27:19] <improwizacja> thx alot
[07:27:34] <johnkpaul> does the bot have a dom?
[07:27:41] <johnkpaul> ?eval $(document.body)
[07:27:43] <bot-t> johnkpaul: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[07:27:47] <johnkpaul> nope
[07:28:09] <Flo0815> does someone know a php channel? #php is invite inly
[07:28:11] <Flo0815> *only
[07:28:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> oh, I just started on style properties via jquery, did not know about that >.<
[07:28:53] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: it's ##php
[07:29:25] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services ?!
[07:29:33] <johnkpaul> you need to have a registered nick
[07:29:41] <johnkpaul> ?g freenode register nickserv

[07:31:07] <b-lew> anyone know much about fancy box? I'm having some problems!
[07:31:26] <px12> could someone tell me how do i select the direct childs of an element but not the childs nested inside the childs of the parent element?
[07:33:01] <px12> quicksilver? there?
[07:34:04] <px12> why is the channel so quiet today? o.O
[07:35:08] <px12> ThemNuts is alive?'
[07:35:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> People here tend not to chat that much, unless it's about jquery and things they know ;)
[07:35:30] <px12> haha
[07:35:45] <px12> do you happen to know what i'm talking about? the selector for my purpose?
[07:35:54] <ChrisTheSorcerer> so if no answer is given, it's because noone wants to clog the chat
[07:36:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I'm too much of a n00b, I usually hang here to snap up some tips and tricks
[07:36:19] <px12> i know that.. :P i was just trying to stir things up :P
[07:36:33] <Flo0815> px12 try $.children
[07:36:41] <px12> thanks :)
[07:37:33] <feyd> can anyone explain why the 'selected' attribute never triggers on dynamically filled select options?
[07:37:49] <johnkpaul> feyd: because the attribute hsn't changed
[07:37:55] <johnkpaul> .prop will though
[07:38:02] <johnkpaul> (if I understand it correctly)
[07:38:03] <alex88> i'm trying to use this selector, '.img_select_box[rel="'+id+'"]' how can i use that as case-insensitive? sgGO is the same as sggo in results
[07:38:30] <feyd> johnkpaul: it wont behave like a normal select would unless I force it to, then?
[07:38:38] <feyd> that seems crazy
[07:38:41] <johnkpaul> no, it will, prop will work in both cases
[07:38:41] <muszek_> hi... I have a text input and want to bind events to it that would be triggered when anything in that input changes (user types in a character or uses mouse to paste text).  how do I do it?
[07:38:56] <feyd> johnkpaul: i'll try that out then
[07:38:58] <johnkpaul> alex88: I think that you'll need to select both
[07:39:04] <muszek_> bind('keyup change') doesn't work nice
[07:39:06] <muszek_> nicely
[07:39:11] <johnkpaul> muszek_: why not?
[07:39:30] <muszek_> johnkpaul: because I need to left-click after I paste with a mouse
[07:39:39] <alex88> johnkpaul: i need? you mean there is no way to select only the correct case?
[07:39:58] <johnkpaul> alex88: oh, you want to select one but _not_ the other?
[07:40:04] <johnkpaul> I thought you wanted to select both
[07:40:25] <alex88> johnkpaul: i want to select only the one with the same case in the whole string (id)
[07:40:26] <johnkpaul> muszek_: ah, if you want to get pasting working, it's a bit more complicated
[07:40:30] <johnkpaul> take a look at jquery.console
[07:40:41] <johnkpaul> it's a very good example of how to do it, but it's not simple
[07:41:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> So there's no value-change-event?
[07:41:41] <alex88> johnkpaul: as i can see from webz, everyone need case insensitive way, but in this case seems it selects as it's case insensitive
[07:41:51] <muszek_> johnkpaul: thanks
[07:42:48] <johnkpaul> muszek_: no problem, have fun
[07:42:53] <johnkpaul> alex88: can you show an example on jsfiddle?
[07:43:12] <alex88> johnkpaul: was just doing that, http://jsfiddle.net/8rM9J/ i want that only asd is removed, not ASd
[07:43:25] <feyd> johnkpaul: I see what you meant by prop, but it doesnt solve the situation. How can I detect when a new option is clicked? Do I have to manually set the property on every single option now?
[07:43:27] <Nielske> I have made a button to add forms and one to delete forms. When you clicked the fifth time on the add button, the add button must dissapear, but than jumps the delete form button to the left (because its in a table). I want that the add button isn't invisible, but it has to stay open (something that replace the add button). this is my code
[07:43:29] <Nielske> http://pastebin.com/0srEXP65
[07:45:09] <johnkpaul> alex88: you know what, I bet that in the spec, rel is case insensitive
[07:45:16] <Nielske> actually, it does all that but when i press the [-] again so that the [+] appears again, it doesn't work anymore
[07:45:20] <alex88> Nielske: you just want the add button to be replaced with an element with same size so cancel button stays there?
[07:45:22] <johnkpaul> feyd: a new option being clicked should trigger change
[07:45:44] <feyd> agreed, but that never occurs, it's bizarre
[07:45:52] <Nielske> so after replaceWith the click() event on the addbutton doesn't work anymore. Any ideas?
[07:46:07] <alex88> johnkpaul: oh, is there such difference between attributes? also case sensitivity? where should i fine the specs?
[07:46:20] <johnkpaul> alex88: I mean the w3c spec
[07:46:47] <johnkpaul> alex88: I don't actually know that, it's just a guess
[07:46:54] <alex88> Nielske: if you replacewith, it's a new element, it won't trigger the .click() anymore
[07:47:02] <alex88> johnkpaul: ok, i'll try with id, thank you!
[07:47:22] <johnkpaul> no problem alex88, let me know how it goes
[07:47:58] <muszek> another problem... I want to attach a hash part to current url and reload the page... window.location = $(this).attr('href'); window.location.reload(true); (href attr has the same url with a new hash part) this approach seems a bit lenghty... anyone got a better idea?
[07:48:01] <johnkpaul> feyd: if the user actually selects the option, change should fire on the select box
[07:48:08] <johnkpaul> are you adding the .change handler to the option element?
[07:49:06] <Nielske> and what solution can i use?
[07:53:41] <jeedey_> Hi, jQuery is included on the page and is used throughout, on one <script> instance though i get $ is not defined, even though in chrome console $ is defined (post error)
[07:53:57] <feyd> johnkpaul: no, I have no code running on options other than adding them to the select
[07:54:18] <johnkpaul> feyd: so change won't fire on the option
[07:54:19] <feyd> johnkpaul: the changed selected=selected attr should appear in the inspector, right? it does on non-dynamic selects just fine
[07:54:20] <alex88> johnkpaul: works like a charm with id, thanks;)
[07:54:26] <johnkpaul> :) awesome alex88
[07:54:50] <pifantastic> jeedey_: that means that something is overwriting the $ variable, or, you are including that <script> before the jQuery <script>
[07:55:03] <jeedey_> not included before, way down the page
[07:55:05] <monk12> Just curious, why are most 'scrollTo animation' tutorials have code like this: $('html,body').stop(true,true).animate({scrollTop: targetOffset}, 1000);  i tried putting a complete function... so when its done scrollign to topmost error, it highlights the div... It highlights the div twice because i think it's scrolling once for 'html' and once for 'body..'. I could take out 'body'... but seems like its recommended to use $('html,body')
[07:55:14] <jeedey_> and if it was getting overwritten, it wouldnt be still defined on the page later on would it?
[07:55:40] <pifantastic> jeedey_: not unless it was getting redefined
[07:55:49] <pifantastic> jeedey_: are you by any chance using Wordpress?
[07:55:54] <jeedey_> no
[07:55:59] <pifantastic> and are you using jQuery.noConflict() ?
[07:56:02] <jeedey_> no
[07:56:20] <pifantastic> If something is calling jQuery.noConflict() it will unattached jQuery to the $ variable
[07:56:34] <jeedey_> ya i know
[07:56:36] <pifantastic> jeedey_: in the place that you are getting the error, try using jQuery instead of $
[07:56:38] <monk12> guess maybe i found a soluton : http://stackoverflow.com/a/1207365/201156
[07:56:42] <jeedey_> i already have >.>
[07:56:56] <pifantastic> jeedey_: hmm, hard to say without seeing the code
[07:57:06] <jeedey_> the code is only one line for what i was trying to call
[07:57:16] <jeedey_> $('#discount_marker').html(markup).fadeIn('medium');
[07:57:29] <jeedey_> markup is defined, #discount_marker is present on the page
[07:57:34] <pifantastic> I mean, I would need to see all the code
[07:57:43] <AdvoWork> can i remove an element by id from a div, but not completely(so not just $('#id).remove(); but specify that i want to remove it from its container?
[07:58:21] <jeedey_> ahh theres 100s of lines of someone elses stupid code on this site (im just developing a specific bit of js) but i did check and theyre not no conflicting or redefining it :/
[07:58:22] <pifantastic> AdvoWork: where does it go then?
[07:58:31] <infid> AdvoWork: like $('containerName #id).remove()?
[07:58:47] <pifantastic> infid: that is uncessesary as IDs are unique
[07:59:00] <infid> true
[07:59:21] <infid> just asking if that's what he means
[07:59:24] <pifantastic> jeedey_: I don't know what to tell you other than you need to track down where $ is getting redefined
[07:59:32] <monk12> Cool that stackoverflow solution worked. wonder why the double-coverage is 'needed' (there's always an html and always a body)
[07:59:37] <ThemNuts> sup guys, helping out Nielske with his site but he's a bit new to all this. Maybe i can explain a bit better: When using replaceWith() to replace a div that has a click event inside it, and having it re-appear with another replaceWith(); the event doesn't work anymore. ive read that .live works but no idea how to implement it
[07:59:41] <ThemNuts> any suggestions?
[07:59:51] <pifantastic> ?detach @ ThemNuts
[07:59:51] <bot-t> ThemNuts, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[08:00:02] <infid> hahha
[08:00:02] <pifantastic> keeps events ^
[08:00:07] <ThemNuts> http://pastebin.com/0srEXP65
[08:00:08] <infid> detach them nuts
[08:00:13] <pifantastic> lol
[08:00:13] <ThemNuts> wat math?
[08:00:25] <ThemNuts> please don't
[08:00:28] <ThemNuts> they are special :)
[08:00:38] <pifantastic> ThemNuts: detach() removes an element but keeps its events bound
[08:00:44] <AdvoWork> pif, infid ive basically got an <img inside a div, my image id is taghidden, and the container is column.  $('#column #taghidden').remove(); doesn't seem to remove it
[08:00:57] <jeedey_> ok thanks pifantastic seems ill just have to bang my head on it til it works :D
[08:01:07] <pifantastic> AdvoWork: again, IDs are unique, so that selector is unecessary
[08:01:08] <infid> that's what she said
[08:01:38] <infid> hrm jquery is so simple yet i still finding myself learning something new about it every day
[08:02:48] <infid> wish i would have known about detach() yesterday, i think i could have used it
[08:04:06] <ThemNuts> pifantastic: thats the reason why i used replaceWith, it is replaced with a span of the same size so that the button next to it stays at the same place
[08:04:54] <pifantastic> unfortunately replaceWith will not detach the old element
[08:06:45] <ThemNuts> what it has to do: a plus button is what we start with, as soon as you press it an extra input appears with a minus button next to the plus. By the time you add 5 field it has to dissappear the plus button but the spot has to be occupied since else the minus will move left wich we don't want
[08:10:10] <pifantastic> ThemNuts: then just put a wrapper around it
[08:10:16] <pifantastic> and set it's dimensions with CSS
[08:12:29] <ThemNuts> :x
[08:17:26] <yannickoo> hey guys, how can I check whether all items of the object the exist?  settings.ReferencesDialog.fields
[08:19:19] <px12> yo! :P how do i add event handlers already defined at page load for certain classes to elements that are added dynamically(after page load).. kinda like.. how do i delegate those events to the new elements with same class?
[08:21:02] <px12> yo? :P
[08:21:05] <NoiseEee> px12: $('#commonParent').on('click','.classOfAllThingsThatShouldTheCallbackShouldApplyTo',function() {})
[08:21:21] <px12> lemme try that
[08:23:07] <px12> that didn't really worked. :/ 			$(this).parent().on('click','.ex-link',function() {});
[08:23:25] <px12> ohh... sorry.. my bad.. i didn't changed the event. :P
[08:26:02] <px12> NoiseEee: well.. it didn't worked.. these all are links.. and when one of them is clicked.. i want it to stop the hover effect.. so i do this. $(this).unbind('mouseenter mouseleave'); now i want other previously selected link to resume its normal hover effect by adding these two lines just after the previous one.. but it doesn't work.  $(this).parent().on('mouseenter','.ex-link',function() {}); $(this).parent().on('mouseleave','.ex-link',function() {});
[08:27:11] <px12> or is it that i have to copy the earlier added functions in this 'ApplyTo', function() {' part? :/ cant it just take up what it used to do earlier? :/
[08:27:15] <NoiseEee> px12: not really what i suggested, but please jsfiddle
[08:33:09] <px12> NoiseEee: well.. i did something to fix that.. now.. how do select all children from .children except the 'b' tag?
[08:35:15] <px12> anyone?
[08:36:21] <px12> figured it out :P
[08:42:12] <WebDragon> #jquery-ui not very large or active as #jquery is -- is it okay if I ask my question here? http://jqueryui.com/demos/ doesn't go into detail on how the highlight and error 'widgets' are used. do I merely add the markup manually? or what
[08:45:33] <feyd> alright I really, really need help with applying the selected attribute on a select. My options are dynamically generated, and because of this, the 'selected' attribute never gets applied when a new option is clicked. Apparently, I have to apply it manually, how can I do this?
[08:56:56] <rbennacer> hey guys
[09:00:02] <evasivx> hi rbennacer !
[09:00:31] <rbennacer> is there a way to have a timer in jquery
[09:00:39] <rbennacer> like a reliable plugin
[09:01:25] <ThemNuts> thanks pifantastic that worked obviously :)
[09:01:33] <ThemNuts> see you guys later
[09:03:21] <johnkpaul> rbennacer: what do you mean a timer?
[09:03:31] <johnkpaul> something like setTimeout?
[09:04:30] <rbennacer> i am trying to build an application you will a bar and on the righ a buton start. whenever you push start the bar will progress according to the time
[09:06:21] <rbennacer> what should i use to count the time?
[09:07:25] <mikkelb> Technology based on mobile apps, what's that called? Mobile technology or mobile app technology?
[09:07:34] <xSmurf> anyone using the tubeplayer here? how can one determine if a video has been removed
[09:07:48] <xSmurf> some videos report the size at 0 but some don't
[09:13:06] <eph3meral> so when I have a form input like <input name="comment_ids[]" id="getComments"/> and I do $("getComments") in the chrome console, I just get an (empty) array
[09:13:15] <johnkpaul> ?g settimeout @rbennacer
[09:13:16] <bot-t> rbennacer, Window setTimeout() Method - http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
[09:13:31] <eph3meral> so, somewhat obviously, .val() isn't going to do what I would normally expect for non-array based form elements
[09:13:38] <eph3meral> so what should I use to set a value or values
[09:13:40] <eph3meral> .push() ?
[09:14:24] <eph3meral> cuz honestly, i know it's a bit messed, but i only have a single value in this array... like, ever... it's a 1:M in the database but it's a 1:1 on the user side
[09:14:47] <eph3meral> (not my code, this is the legacy I get to deal with)
[09:15:48] <eph3meral> yeah, so I just tried .push() and that doesn't do what I want
[09:15:50] <johnkpaul> eph3meral: what are you trying to do?
[09:15:53] <eph3meral> so how do I set a value of an element like that?
[09:16:12] <johnkpaul> eph3meral: are you sure jquery is in the page
[09:16:17] <eph3meral> johnkpaul, I want to set the value="" attribute of a given form element
[09:16:20] <johnkpaul> also it's $("#getComments")
[09:16:22] <johnkpaul> you need the #
[09:16:32] <johnkpaul> and you might have jquery no conflict on, so try jQuery("#getComments")
[09:16:33] <eph3meral> yep, i'm sure
[09:16:37] <eph3meral> nope I don't
[09:16:41] <eph3meral> jquery works fine
[09:16:56] <eph3meral> $('#getComments') returns an array
[09:16:58] <eph3meral> an empty one at that
[09:17:15] <eph3meral> and .val("hello") doesn't set the value of said element
[09:17:18] <johnkpaul> can you try document.getElementById("getComments")
[09:17:27] <rodleg> newbie question: i am trying to change an image in a expand/collapse section.  the expand/collpase works but the image doesn't change.  i am not sure what I am missing.  can someone take a look: https://gist.github.com/2239160
[09:18:09] <eph3meral> johnkpaul, yep that does return what seems like an input box
[09:18:18] <eph3meral> chrome console spits out the input tag in question
[09:18:22] <johnkpaul> can you try $().jquery
[09:18:25] <johnkpaul> in the console
[09:18:30] <jovrtn> eph3meral: http://jsfiddle.net/FF8kS/
[09:18:32] <jovrtn> works just fine for me
[09:18:35] <eph3meral> 1.7.1
[09:18:40] <cronin_> is this the correct way to exit a self executing function if the element doesn't exist? http://jsfiddle.net/2V7gJ/
[09:19:05] <johnkpaul> $("#getComments") returns an empty jquery object, but document.getElementById("getComments") doesn't
[09:19:06] <johnkpaul> that's really odd
[09:19:32] <eph3meral> yeh, fairly odd
[09:19:44] <teleyinex> Hi everyone
[09:19:51] <jovrtn> $('#getComments') being returned just fine in that fiddle
[09:19:51] <teleyinex> I need some help :)
[09:19:52] <jovrtn> to the console
[09:20:21] <teleyinex> I want to call two ajax functions: the first to get the appid from one url
[09:20:36] <eph3meral> jovrtn, yes I see that
[09:20:42] <teleyinex> and the second one to get the related data for that appid
[09:20:53] <eph3meral> jquery so far, works fine on every other are of my pages
[09:20:56] <eph3meral> area*
[09:21:01] <teleyinex> the problem is that as everything is async I cannot find a way to do it :(
[09:21:29] * neutronimity waves.
[09:21:33] <teleyinex> the second ajax call, the url: is created based on the result data from the first ajax call
[09:21:57] <teleyinex> how can I integrate both? and more importantly, how can I export an object from the second call?
[09:22:29] <eph3meral> aha, ok this one, however, does not run fine http://jsfiddle.net/eeRLE/
[09:22:44] <eph3meral> I guess jquery doesn't like [ in id attributes
[09:23:03] <eph3meral> sigh, i was hoping I wouldn't have to regex replace all those [ and ] :(
[09:23:03] <jovrtn> why would you need brackets in an id
[09:23:14] <eph3meral> jovrtn, it's not about need, it's about laziness
[09:24:12] <jovrtn> try escaping the brackets
[09:24:17] <jovrtn> in the query
[09:27:19] <cronin_> anyone? am i doing this incorrectly: http://jsfiddle.net/2V7gJ/ or is it a good practice to check if the code should run first like this
[09:27:42] <jovrtn> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[09:27:47] <jovrtn> "If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. For example, if you have an element with id="foo.bar", you can use the selector $("#foo\\.bar"). "
[09:28:24] <jovrtn> brackets might be invalid for css ID names, but jquery should still be able to handle them
[09:29:45] <quicksilver> pretty sure [] are valid, actually
[09:29:56] <quicksilver> certainly loads of toolkits/frameworks use them
[09:30:09] <quicksilver> but as jovrtn says, you need to get the escaping right.
[09:30:50] <neutronimity> I know this isn't jQuery related, but I figured this was the closest where I could ask - I used to be able to return variables from within functions - but that doesn't seem to work any more.
[09:31:42] <eph3meral> yeh, I'm just regexing them into _ on the server side, no big deal, was just trying to save a couple minutes
[09:31:50] <eph3meral> it's all good now
[09:31:50] <NoiseEee> neutronimity: jsfiddle an example of it not working for you
[09:32:00] <eph3meral> but good to know you can double backslash escape them, thx jovrtn
[09:32:58] <jovrtn> np, good luck perpetuating the laziness :D

[09:38:36] <maltray> Hi again guys, Im making an iPad web app, thing is that i need to use the scrollTo plugin, i couldnt find anything on google so i came here, the slideTo in my normal browser is working just fine, but on the Safari Mobile its not working :C, any tips on this?
[09:43:44] <b-lew> I have this problem... this script works here... http://jsfiddle.net/4pAQz/1/ but not here... http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/ *note the 2 images at the top of the page in the left hand corner .. trying to do the same thing... not for sure what i'm doing wrong
[09:44:59] <johnkpaul> b-lew: you mean when you click on them, it creates a lightbox?

[09:49:05] <JanSch_> hi, I am trying to transmit binary data from the server to jquery. I have full control of the server, i.e. I can set headers. is there a way to make this work other than base64 encoding the entire data?
[09:49:41] <b-lew> johnkpaul: I want to click and have it cycle through images and videos but the videos are throwing errors for some reason
[09:52:06] <px12> how do i set free a captured key press (spacebar) by a gallery plugin?
[09:52:59] <b-lew> johnkpaul: I think I have a scripting problem but its not throwing me an error.
[09:53:37] <px12> any ideas on how to unbind a keypress event?
[10:00:18] <eph3meral> how would I retreive $('input:not(:disabled)')
[10:00:22] <eph3meral> is that the correct syntax?
[10:00:34] <eph3meral> or more specifically $('.someClass:not(:disabled)')
[10:03:09] <gnarf> ? disabled selector
[10:03:13] <bot-t> gnarf, :disabled Selector - Selects all elements that are disabled. http://api.jquery.com/disabled-selector/
[10:03:20] <gnarf> eph3meral: yeah - that should work
[10:03:58] <gnarf> eph3meral: you could also $(".someClass").not(":disabled")
[10:06:15] <eph3meral> gnarf, ok thanks
[10:09:05] <neutronimity> I played a bit more with it -
[10:09:14] <neutronimity> new function(){ var something = 'that something'; return something }; console.log(something);
[10:09:14] <neutronimity> versus
[10:09:19] <gnarf> ?twss @neutronimity
[10:09:19] <bot-t> neutronimity, <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[10:09:21] <neutronimity> new function(){ return (something = 'that something') }; console.log(something);

[10:18:11] <MacroMan> I have 2 images, one on top of the other, and I'm using jquery .animate() to make the top image transparent
[10:18:37] <MacroMan> opaque rather
[10:18:57] <MacroMan> Is there anyway to make parts of an image opaque and other parts not?
[10:21:08] <catcher> I have a jquery event handler that needs to get data from my DB based on ID (which is passed in).  What's the best way to get that data, should I have my js call a controller action that returns the corresponding JSON?
[10:21:29] <jita> Is there any free alternative to snapengage.com, i only need this for email.
[10:21:39] <anphonic> What is the syntax for passing values to a php script from jquery
[10:21:44] <MacroMan> catcher: I would. Just have a php page that you call with Ajax
[10:21:51] <EMKO> i coded a login form modal window where i use ajax to check if login succeeded etc  http://pastebin.com/L7Vp3xm7 is there a better way to to this?
[10:22:05] <MacroMan> anphonic: The same as if your passing from the rl
[10:22:22] <MacroMan> url, like this: websit.com?thisvar=value
[10:22:42] <MacroMan> The variables would be in $_GET[] in php
[10:23:04] <catcher> MacroMan, thanks for the reassurance
[10:23:30] <anphonic> so like phpfile(url); ?
[10:24:11] <anphonic> trying to create a bridge and use curl to fetch an xml file.
[10:26:29] <MacroMan> anphonic: Probably using Ajax. That's the way I would go
[10:27:04] <MacroMan> so $('#mydiv').load('www.website.com?myvar=value');
[10:28:17] <anphonic> breakdown: have an html page, it accepts zipcodes. passes zip to a function thats gets lat/lng then passes those to another function to set up the url to pull from.
[10:28:53] <anphonic> server im pulling from doesnt have access control set to I can use just ajax or a json option

[10:36:27] <VernonK> jeffsmykil: Do you have a fiddle or something where we can see an example of it failing?

[10:50:54] <diverdude> NoiseEee: oh boy...that looks like a more complicated api
[10:51:24] <NoiseEee> diverdude: what you're trying to do is rather complicated and private, so you need to jump through some various hoops
[10:52:00] <diverdude> NoiseEee: hmm yeah it seems to be much more complex than i thought

[10:57:08] <diverdude> NoiseEee: damn...i cannot even link to http://docs.google.com/ :/
[10:59:34] <Advocated> could it be because it doesn't know where to send the returned results to?

[11:06:28] <Advocated> hmm, where in an auto complete render does it state where to set the results?
[11:07:54] <Wilrod> is .resize broken or something? Cause it wont detect when height changes by toggling element (show/hide)
[11:07:58] <catcher> is delegate able to attach to elements that didn't exist before load?
[11:08:15] <Advocated> catcher, i think so
[11:08:20] <catcher> .on() is not an option, I'm stuck in jQuery 1.3.2.
[11:08:37] <catcher> I'll give it a go, thanks Advocated
[11:08:57] <catcher> Ah, delgate didn't exist til 1.4.2. Crap.
[11:09:10] <Wilrod> catcher, live then?
[11:09:21] <catcher> Yep, looks like I'm stuck with it.
[11:09:23] <NoiseEee> catcher: there's few excuses for devving with a library so out of date
[11:09:33] <Advocated> argh, can auto complete not be shared across multiple inputs, singularly they work, like $("#client_search_name,#client_search_phone").autocomplete({ .. they don't. I cant find anything in the docs to explain why?
[11:10:13] <abnormalex> whats the best way to call a php function on html button click?
[11:10:18] <Wilrod> no ideas on "onresize" anyone? Seems broken
[11:10:31] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: see ?ajax
[11:10:32] <bot-t> abnormalex, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:10:38] <Wilrod> "resize" event to be more specific
[11:10:52] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: see ?resize
[11:10:52] <bot-t> Wilrod, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[11:11:28] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: i know, but im not sure if is hould post, get, etc. id rather not have to call the url, and just call the function, since the php file is already being included in the page
[11:11:47] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: If you don't know, odds are you want GET
[11:11:54] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, sure, I know how it works. But it wont detect dynamic changes to the content
[11:12:19] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Clearly not, read the description of when the event is triggered
[11:13:14] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, so how can I make that happen then? I need to trigger resize event when content is changed dynamically
[11:13:22] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: why do you suggest get not post? and I was hoping i could not have to call the url again because the file is already included in the page. is that possible?
[11:13:38] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Then where you change it, call .resize() on the element or .trigger("resize")
[11:13:38] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: i think you're confused about what XHR/ajax is?
[11:14:07] <abnormalex> abnormalex: could be
[11:14:33] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, sure but I want that to be the default behaviour. Not having to manually trigger resize for each fucntion doing toggle logic
[11:14:33] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: i dont think so
[11:14:39] <johnkpaul> I didn't think that resize was intended for use for something other than the window
[11:14:45] <b-lew> must be lunch time?
[11:15:14] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: Why don't you explain a little further
[11:15:33] <abnormalex> explain what ajax ?
[11:15:35] <Eviltwin> Since you asked if it should be GET or POST, I assumed you weren't terribly familiar with AJAX / HTTP
[11:15:56] <abnormalex> get or post would have nothing to do with ajax really
[11:15:57] <Wilrod> what I´m doing is that I have an iframe and I want to set the proper height of the iframe to fit it´s content. And when content change dunamically the iframe is too small
[11:17:11] <Wilrod> the iframe size need to be updated when content height changes dynamically
[11:17:38] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: I don't think that there's a native event to handle what you're talking about
[11:17:47] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: You know that AJAX makes an HTTP request, right? And that HTTP had everything to do with GET and POST
[11:17:56] <johnkpaul> when the scrollHeight of an element changes, I don't believe there's an event
[11:18:06] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: So saying that GET and POST have nothing to do with AJAX is not really true
[11:18:40] <Eviltwin> You could say that it's not specific to GET and POST but even that's not true in some browsers.
[11:19:09] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, why scrollheight and not just .height()?
[11:19:30] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: height() is the height of the element
[11:19:38] <johnkpaul> scrollHeight is how much there is to scroll
[11:19:43] <johnkpaul> !mdn scrollheight
[11:19:50] <johnkpaul> ?mdn scrollHeight
[11:19:51] <bot-t> johnkpaul, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[11:19:57] <johnkpaul> damn
[11:20:00] <johnkpaul> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[11:20:09] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: yeah i know
[11:20:19] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: when the content inside the iframe changes. the iframe's .height() will not change
[11:20:21] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: So WTF did you just say that?
[11:20:50] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: and xhr is done after the page load, so you're looking at a request SOMEWHERE regardless of the origin page
[11:21:08] <abnormalex> oh i didnt want to argue, but i said it because ajax just makes http requests, and the fact that get and post are http requests dont really have anything to do with ajax specifically
[11:21:11] <impro_from_Polan> d
[11:21:48] <catcher> I have a string in the form of item_id_3, need to get '3' out of it... am I headed to regex land?
[11:21:57] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, I know, thats why i want the iframe page to fire a .resize event so I can get the iframe contents height and set it again
[11:22:28] <johnkpaul> what I'm saying is that event is not what you're looking for
[11:22:29] <sarspazam> anyone noticed the screen going black during a jquery animation in chrome osx?
[11:22:30] <sarspazam> SL
[11:22:35] <johnkpaul> resize does not pay attention to the scrollHeight
[11:22:37] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: If your question is about how can you call a PHP function from an HTML button click without making an HTTP request to some URL, then you're not understanding how this stuff works
[11:22:53] <Eviltwin> PHP renders into HTML (and possibly JS/CSS)
[11:23:06] <johnkpaul> (but hopefully not JS/CSS)
[11:23:09] <Eviltwin> Once that rendering finishes, the DOM ready and load events happen
[11:23:24] <Eviltwin> But those don't happen until the PHP script finishes and that runtime goes away
[11:23:28] <KevlarSoul> Anyone here create a styled google map using V3 api?
[11:23:41] <Eviltwin> Meaning that the only way you can "run a PHP function" is to create a new runtime
[11:23:41] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: I think to achieve this, as long as your iframe is on the same domain, you're going to need to setInterval() that checks the scrollHeight
[11:23:46] <b-lew> anyway i can grab a bit of help when someone is free?
[11:23:50] <sarspazam> browser update... solves problem
[11:23:53] <KevlarSoul> Specifically this: http://googlemapscolorizr.stadtwerk.org/#water/geometry/999999/simplified/landscape/geometry/c6adbe/simplified/road/all/fa3eba/on/administrative.land_parcel/geometry//off/road.local/labels/f6cee9/on/water/all//off/poi.park/all//off/poi/all/000000/off
[11:23:54] <Eviltwin> And the only way you can do that from the browser side is to request a URL
[11:23:56] <sarspazam> so much for silent updtes
[11:23:58] <sarspazam> dates*
[11:23:59] <Bertl> greeting! I'm using JQuery tabs (with ajax requests for the tab content) to create a page, everything works so far, now I tried to put a <script> tag in the html loaded via ajax, but that seems to get silently stripped out and thus is ignored?
[11:24:07] <abnormalex> ok. i just thought because the php file was included in the page. and I can easily execute <?php myFunction();... I could maybe execute the block of code on a button click (with or without js, jquery, or ajax)
[11:24:23] <johnkpaul> b-lew: sadly you're problem is extremely not obvious, have you tried slowly removing code to see if you can pin down the source of hte difference
[11:24:37] <minna1> How do i check if a string contains any number?
[11:24:44] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: No, you can basically think of PHP as a program that writes an HTML/JavaScript-based program
[11:24:55] <johnkpaul> minna1: regex test
[11:24:56] <Eviltwin> And once it's done writing that program, the HTML/JavaScript program runs
[11:25:11] <Eviltwin> But it's done after, the PHP runtime is gone at that point
[11:25:13] <johnkpaul> ?eval "hell0".test(/\d/)
[11:25:17] <bot-t> johnkpaul: TypeError: "hell0".test is not a function
[11:25:29] <johnkpaul> ?eval /\d/.test("hell0")
[11:25:31] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true
[11:25:37] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, the solution works already but I had to use a plugin to have .resize fire when content changes dynamically. Thats why I wondered if .resize was broken in jquery.
[11:25:38] <johnkpaul> I never remember which way test is defined
[11:25:38] <abnormalex> ok, that makes sense Eviltwin, thanks
[11:25:38] <tomasm-> hi, on a form.submit() event, is there a way to know if it was triggered by a submit button/image (input type=submit/image) being clicked? without binding the handler to the button itself (but instead to the form.submit)
[11:26:10] <johnkpaul> ah, so Wilrod, your plugin is probably doing that internally on it's own, and triggering an event called resize
[11:26:15] <minna1> johnkpaul: ah, d, i used [0-9] but that didnt work
[11:26:33] <b-lew> johnkpaul: I have, its a bit of a pain. not having much luck
[11:26:40] <Advocated> anyone got any ideas regarding multiple inputs with the same auto complete function? it works perfectly with one, but if you pass a class instead, it sends and retreives the data but it doesn't display it, and i can't find why :S
[11:27:00] <johnkpaul> minna1: yeah, it's hard to remember it all, but \d is one I use pretty regularl
[11:27:06] <johnkpaul> there's also a lot of cheat sheets out there
[11:27:17] <minna1> johnkpaul: Ok, thanks for reminding me :-)
[11:27:18] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, whats weird is that <body onload="onresize" works great and detects even dynamic height changes but thats not proper/valid html :(
[11:27:41] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: that works for an iframe changing content internal to the iframe?
[11:27:43] <Wilrod> Uhm I mean <body onresize="myfunction();"
[11:27:48] <abnormalex> can I reference relative path files with jquery get?
[11:27:59] <abnormalex> $.get('../private/session.php', function(logout()) {
[11:28:37] <Eviltwin> Yes, XHR respects relative paths the same way it does for <A> tags etc
[11:28:45] <Eviltwin> And <SCRIPT src> etc
[11:28:46] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, no, that works for a single page to raise the event. Wich then can try to call a function in parent (that resizes the iframe whe nthe page is used in one)
[11:29:01] <Wilrod> was hoping jquery .resize worked the same but it dont :(
[11:29:44] <catcher> I need to pass a number to a jquery handler that changes per item, is assigning class="item_id_#" the best way to go?
[11:29:56] <catcher> And then get the # back out with a regex in the jquery function?
[11:30:16] <Eviltwin> No
[11:30:29] <NoiseEee> catcher: if you're talking about storying data in some way, use data- attributes.  <div id='something' data-itemnumber='144b'>someting</div>
[11:30:44] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: hm, I don't know much about the body onresize handler, are you using ie?
[11:30:58] <Wilrod> yes
[11:31:00] <NoiseEee> catcher: also see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[11:31:01] <catcher> ty NoiseEee, gtk
[11:31:02] <Wilrod> not only but
[11:31:37] <abnormalex> i dont seem to be able to directly call a function qith jquery, correct? do i need to send a variable, and let the php file decide the function to execute?
[11:31:40] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/ie6_fires_onresize
[11:31:48] <johnkpaul> check to make sure your solution works in other browsers
[11:31:49] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: Call a PHP function with jQuery?
[11:31:51] <johnkpaul> I have a feeling that it won't
[11:32:02] <abnormalex> yes Eviltwin ajax
[11:32:08] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: How are you trying to do that?
[11:32:32] <Eviltwin> 'Cause you're right that there's no way you could do it directly but I'm not sure how you're even attempting to
[11:32:40] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, ok thanks.
[11:33:08] <abnormalex> $.get("test.php");
[11:33:11] <Wilrod> would it be a good or bad idea to "override" .toggle so that it fires resize event?
[11:33:21] <Wilrod> and is it even possible?
[11:33:21] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Yes, yes it would
[11:33:28] <Eviltwin> It would be a very bad idea
[11:33:29] <Eviltwin> Don't do that
[11:33:38] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, ok :) suggestions?
[11:33:42] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: just fire resize manually
[11:33:48] <Eviltwin> Do just about anything else but not that
[11:33:53] <Eviltwin> That's my suggestion
[11:33:58] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @Wilrod
[11:33:59] <bot-t> Wilrod, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:34:30] <Wilrod> yeah i triggered it manually but I bet other devs will forget it
[11:35:02] <Wilrod> wich will brake the site when used in iframe, and a little hard to notice the error aswell
[11:35:12] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Then define a new function that they should use instead
[11:35:21] <Eviltwin> Something that calls trigger and toggle
[11:35:59] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, same issue really... I was hoping for some easy and good way to change the default behavior but...
[11:36:27] <Advocated> anyone know how the autocomplete render item works? in terms of applying it to multiple inputs?
[11:36:35] <Wilrod> eviltwin, if it sucks I guess it sucks... could you enlighten me why ?
[11:36:37] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: is what im trying to do possible? execute a function on click? not just get a php url
[11:36:40] <Eviltwin> Changing the "default behavior" of toggle to do something completely unrelated to the what toggle does is completely wrong
[11:37:03] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: I was asking what you were trying to do
[11:37:15] <Eviltwin> You said you did something that didn't work
[11:37:23] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: if you're problem is that the other devs will forget it, make sure that it's obvious from the calling code
[11:37:31] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, but is it really unrelated then? Toggle do change the document height, why not fire .resize then?
[11:37:46] <Eviltwin> There are plenty of uses of .toggle that do not change the window size
[11:37:53] <Wilrod> true...
[11:37:54] <Eviltwin> Let's say another dev wants to do that
[11:38:03] <abnormalex> thats right Eviltwin its not working, is it even possible?
[11:38:07] <Eviltwin> Suddenly .toggle's doing something COMPLETELY UNDOCUMENTED AND WRONG
[11:38:11] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: It's not
[11:38:20] <Eviltwin> I thought you understood how this stuff works
[11:38:39] <catcher> NoiseEee, I've got data-itemid="55" showing up in my anchor element, and a live() handler attached to the anchor.  In the handler, $(this).data('itemid'); is coming up undefined, what am I missing?
[11:38:52] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, your right. Thanks
[11:39:03] <NoiseEee> catcher: jsfiddle if you can please
[11:39:07] <catcher> kk
[11:39:10] <Eviltwin> catcher: First, please don't use .live if you have access to .delegate or .on
[11:39:14] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[11:39:20] <catcher> Eviltwin, I unfortunately do not have access to either.
[11:39:29] <Eviltwin> Then upgrade :P
[11:39:31] <catcher> Stuck in 1.3.2 with a nasty upgrade path.
[11:39:38] <catcher> Client won't spring for the time to do it.
[11:40:22] <Eviltwin> Then you shouldn't have signed on :P
[11:40:31] <Wilrod> Eviltwin, but do you know if theres any reason that .resize doesnt fire when content height changes dynamically?
[11:40:38] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Yes
[11:40:44] <Wilrod> Ok, why then?
[11:40:46] <Eviltwin> Because that's not what the event is for
[11:41:05] <Eviltwin> Just like the change event doesn't fire if you change the HTML in the page
[11:41:08] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: this is what I explained earlier, resize means something differnt to you
[11:41:10] <Eviltwin> It's because that's not what the change event means
[11:41:21] <johnkpaul> a change in scrollHeight isn't a resize
[11:41:47] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: i just said i understood how ajax, in concept, works. please confirm its impossible to call a php function with ajax, and i will stop trying, and just wrap my button in php form
[11:42:00] <Eviltwin> Wilrod: Browsers didn't see the need to have events for actions that JavaScript takes itself
[11:42:05] <sean`> hi
[11:42:17] <Eviltwin> Because JavaScript is already doing it, it can just inform any interested parties then
[11:42:18] <sean`> my jquery is saying foul words
[11:42:24] <SeanFallon> o.O
[11:42:32] <sean`> I have jquery 1.2.4
[11:42:42] <Eviltwin> It also prevents you from accidentally creating infinite event loops
[11:42:49] <Eviltwin> sean`: Sounds like you should upgrade
[11:43:01] <NoiseEee> so frustrating
[11:43:05] <Eviltwin> sean`: Seeing as that's now more than 4 years old
[11:43:15] <NoiseEee> i think if you're going to be a js developer, you need to commit your code and your clients code to being up to date
[11:43:26] <NoiseEee> there is no reason 1.2.4 should be even mentioned in this channel
[11:43:27] <NoiseEee> </rant>
[11:43:30] <sean`> :-P
[11:43:37] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: You're wrong
[11:43:43] <sean`> lolol
[11:43:57] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: I think if you're going to be a js developer and you want help from us, you need to commit your code and your clients code to being up to date
[11:44:13] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: did you read this? http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/ie6_fires_onresize
[11:44:15] <NoiseEee> noted
[11:44:17] <rbennacer> hey guys
[11:44:22] <johnkpaul> that explains your confusion, it's because in IE, they are the same event
[11:44:57] <rbennacer> i am using setinterval in my app , and i would like to know what is the current time for it? ex: timer.current=25sec
[11:45:39] <sean`> rbennacer, you should assign the time on the first interval call to a variable
[11:45:49] <sean`> and then you can calculate the difference inside your function
[11:45:53] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, you dont get what I´m asking :) Forget the iframe part, thus also the scrollheight you seem to focus at. I just want .resize event to fire when height is changed for a element that I have bound the event to.
[11:45:54] <sean`> timeStart - +new Date
[11:46:03] <catcher> NoiseEee, http://jsfiddle.net/wf6YA/   (pulling the text rather than the itemid)
[11:46:26] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: can you please create a jsfiddle to describe this?
[11:46:38] <sean`> rbennacer, hey bro, keep it in the channel :-)
[11:46:45] <sean`> so other people can learn from it
[11:46:50] <rbennacer> ok sure
[11:46:54] <Eviltwin> catcher: Welcome to jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/wf6YA/1/
[11:47:01] <rbennacer> can you give me an example please
[11:47:19] <sean`> var timeStart = +new Date; setInterval (function () { console.log ('microseconds passed since first call', timeStart - +new Date)}, 1000);
[11:47:25] <sean`> there's an example brah
[11:47:41] <sean`> omg I have no clean socks for tomorrow
[11:47:52] <Eviltwin> sean`: That's not really topical discussion here
[11:48:17] <anphonic> newbish question now, var $name = new Array(); $name = {many variables} ;
[11:48:20] <sodapop> is it possible to maintain dialog scrollbar position if i close and re open the same dialog ?
[11:48:30] <anphonic> that would make an array of the variables correct?
[11:48:42] <sean`> anphonic, use [] and {} to start
[11:48:44] <NoiseEee> catcher: alas is looks like .data() for what you want there isn't available in in that version of jQ.... so use attr http://codepad.viper-7.com/ScBaYm
[11:48:49] <sean`> so var $name = [], $name2 = {};
[11:48:52] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, it´s not very complex. One single page. bind .resize to body. Toggle show/hide for some content inside the body. Expect .resize to fire as the content height did change
[11:48:58] <sean`> {foo: 'bar'} == hashmap/object anphonic
[11:49:10] <sean`> Eviltwin, my socks are really important to me
[11:49:16] <Eviltwin> sean`: But they're not to us
[11:49:21] <Eviltwin> So we don't want to hear about them
[11:49:31] <rbennacer> thank you sean
[11:49:38] <dilvie> anphonic: name = ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'];
[11:49:40] <sean`> I'll let my socks know :-(
[11:50:04] <dilvie> anphonic: See http://ericleads.com/2011/09/learning-javascript-up-to-speed-in-no-time/
[11:50:07] <WebDragon> how do I tell jquery-ui that <section class="materials"><article><h3/></article><article><h3/></article>(etc)</section> should be what's tabbed. not divs ?
[11:50:07] <johnkpaul> Wilrod: I'm saying that the expectation is incorrect
[11:50:15] <johnkpaul> that's why I ask if you read that article
[11:50:20] <WebDragon> $(".materials").tabs(); no worie
[11:50:21] <WebDragon> workie
[11:50:30] <anphonic> sean`, dilvie: ty
[11:50:58] <catcher> NoiseEee, gotcha, ty
[11:51:13] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, well the jquery docs seem atleast give the impression that .resize is meant to be used on any element http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[11:51:42] <ajpiano> Wilrod: it isn't
[11:51:45] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's true, but that documentation doesn't imply that it would fire when scrollHeight changes
[11:51:53] <gnarf> WebDragon: see the documentation, one of the options is a selector for the tabs
[11:51:55] <ajpiano> it works on elements that *have* a resize event
[11:52:12] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: Wilrod there is a plugin that gives you a resize event for all elements
[11:52:14] <WebDragon> gnarf: *rummaging*
[11:52:24] <johnkpaul> yeah ajpiano, I think he's using that plugin
[11:52:32] <ajpiano> ben_alman's ?
[11:52:36] <Wilrod> right
[11:52:39] <johnkpaul> but does that plugin handle scrollHeight changes, or actual height hanges?
[11:52:41] <johnkpaul> changes*
[11:53:09] <ajpiano> i'm not sure off hand
[11:53:34] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, it detects when content height changes dynamically. Wich .resize doesnt
[11:53:35] <gnarf> WebDragon: actually, it shouldn't care -- just put an ID on the section and it should work
[11:53:35] <ajpiano> Wilrod: why can't you just bind to $(window).resize(fn)
[11:53:40] <johnkpaul> I'm checking now
[11:53:49] <johnkpaul> because Wilrod's checking to see if an iframe's content has grown
[11:53:49] <Wilrod> ajpiano, because it wont detect dynamic height changes
[11:54:04] <ajpiano> ah
[11:54:06] <Wilrod> johnkpaul, no, not because of that
[11:54:12] <WebDragon> gnarf: so .tabs() won't work on a section.class only a section#id ?
[11:54:22] <gnarf> Wilrod: short of polling the height in a setInterval it won't work on it
[11:54:34] <gnarf> WebDragon: href="#id" matches up to id="id"
[11:54:49] <WebDragon> ah!
[11:54:59] <Wilrod> ajpiano, because when I toggle content (show/hide) that does indeed change the height of document/body/window .resize does not fire with standard jquery function
[11:55:06] <gnarf> WebDragon: and no, you can't have a tab href=".class"
[11:55:08] <ajpiano> yes, i am aware of that
[11:55:17] <ajpiano> ben's plugin uses a polling loop on the size
[11:55:18] <gnarf> WebDragon: it uses IDs
[11:55:30] <WebDragon> gnarf: man I'm totally misreading how this works. I was under the impression it added the ul's itself
[11:55:42] <WebDragon> so my markup, tabless, is sans the ul nav
[11:55:57] <Wilrod> ajpiano, you consider this plugin good/stable?
[11:56:01] <WebDragon> I'm abit put out that I have to manually add the ul, as I now see
[11:56:07] <WebDragon> hrm
[11:56:20] <gnarf> WebDragon: yeah, you still need the nav - but like thats what you want for "plain html browsing" anyway
[11:56:32] <ajpiano> Wilrod: i think does what you need, should be plenty stable
[11:56:36] <WebDragon> that's presuming I wanted a sectional nav otherwise
[11:57:03] <donnaR> Hey, how do i select all elements that have a certain text between? example: <a href''>example</a>; $('a') ?
[11:57:15] <Wilrod> ajpiano, it does make the UI a little bit slow though... i guess it´s because of the the "polling loop"?
[11:57:17] <gnarf> WebDragon: you could always write some jQuery to build it right before making tabs
[11:57:28] <WebDragon> gnarf: true dat
[11:57:34] <ajpiano> Wilrod:
[11:58:02] <ajpiano> it is what it is, it's a fundamentally like "bad technique" but it's the only way to get what you want
[11:58:06] <gnarf> ?contains selector @donnaR
[11:58:07] <bot-t> donnaR, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:58:22] <donnaR> thanks
[11:58:26] <Wilrod> ajpiano, ok thanks
[11:58:34] <gnarf> donnaR: its not the fastest selector though - if you can add a class to the element its much faster
[11:58:54] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: $.get("scripts/logout.php");    that works, but I have a header location in the script, why doesnt it refresth the page / send to that header?
[11:58:56] <donnaR> hmm well, is faster than looping each element 'a'? gnarf
[11:59:10] <gnarf> donnaR: honestly, thats what it does
[11:59:26] <donnaR> like $('a').each(......if($(this).text() ==
[11:59:29] <donnaR> ah
[11:59:31] <donnaR> bummer
[11:59:55] <gnarf> donnaR: although - it can use "querySelectorAll" to do that instead of native JS where available
[12:00:12] <gnarf> donnaR: its still slow, even when the browsers selector engine is parsing it
[12:02:00] <donnaR> what if i regex the whole html page, would that be faster? gnarf
[12:02:00] <shadykhan> im looking for a plugin where i have multiple items listed in a row and when you click on a item it will expand and push others down
[12:04:57] <brettster> hey guys
[12:05:37] <brettster> http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html
[12:05:46] <brettster> notice if you click the video in slide two
[12:05:48] <b-lew> @ajpiano I think I'm following you on twitter..
[12:05:49] <b-lew> :)
[12:05:52] <brettster> when you go to slide three
[12:05:53] <brettster> it still plays
[12:06:02] <brettster> i'm using sudo slider and loading the content with ajax
[12:06:05] <brettster> how can I fix this
[12:06:12] <ajpiano> b-lew: great! hope you like hearing about the new york jets
[12:06:29] <brettster> please help - it's going to be a nice site if i could get rid of some little flukes
[12:06:36] <b-lew> haha @ajpiano You free at all or are you buzzzy?
[12:06:41] <ajpiano> i'm busy
[12:06:44] <ajpiano> atm
[12:06:47] <b-lew> okay
[12:07:16] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: It's sounding less and less like you know what AJAX is
[12:07:23] <anphonic> ok, divImg = divArtWrapper.find('img').not().hasClass('fg_enclosure_img')   that should select all images inside the wrapped without the the class, correct?
[12:07:53] <brettster> anyone?
[12:07:56] <brettster> eviltwin
[12:08:27] <brettster> you sound like you may be able to help. I'm loading content into my site with ajax, but from one slide to another the video still plays?
[12:08:55] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ brettster
[12:08:56] <bot-t> brettster, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[12:09:54] <brettster> +bot-t building a working example of my code with this is rediculoys
[12:10:36] <Eviltwin> An example of the issue
[12:10:46] <brettster> http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html
[12:10:51] <brettster> if you go to slide 2
[12:10:54] <brettster> play the video
[12:11:00] <brettster> then go to the next slide
[12:11:03] <brettster> it still play
[12:11:08] <Eviltwin> Fantastic
[12:11:09] <brettster> slide 2 = about us
[12:11:30] <Eviltwin> How does this have to do with jQuery?
[12:12:20] <brettster> because the slider is built with jquery
[12:12:23] <Eviltwin> ...
[12:12:35] <brettster> the video still shouldnt be playing when going to the next slide
[12:12:37] <catcher> brettster, you need to stop the video whenever an action occurs that would change the slide.
[12:12:39] <Eviltwin> You expect the slider to know to stop all of your videos?
[12:12:46] <brettster> jcycle does
[12:12:54] <Eviltwin> Then use jCycle
[12:13:04] <brettster> jcycle doesn't support what I'm doing here.
[12:13:17] <brettster> i'm also cycling through my main navigation
[12:13:21] <brettster> it's not just a slideshow
[12:13:27] <Eviltwin> Then do what catcher suggested
[12:13:32] <gnarf> Eviltwin: make it do all things!
[12:13:43] <brettster> the video is an embed from vimeo
[12:13:48] <brettster> it's not an html5 video
[12:13:56] <Eviltwin> I don't know why people expect plugins to just do everything for them exactly the way they wanted
[12:14:21] <brettster> obviously, I don't - i was looking for a way to fix it.
[12:14:31] <brettster> honestly.
[12:14:35] <brettster> forget it.
[12:14:48] <catcher> brettster, you can embed the video via a player that you can control.
[12:14:55] <Eviltwin> Stopping a video from playing isn't really a jQuery issue
[12:15:02] <Eviltwin> I suggest you turn to Google / StackOverflow
[12:15:27] <catcher> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3688275/stop-a-vimeo-video-with-jquery
[12:16:22] <brettster> eviltwin MY APOLOGIES FOR CONFUSING A JQUERY USABILITY ISSUE WITH A NOT JQUERY USABILITY ISSUE SINCE THE VIDEO IS DEPENDENT ON THE JQUERY SCRIPT, AND THE PROBLEM IS THE SLIDE STILL BEING ACTIVE WHEN IT MOVES TO ANOTHER ONE.
[12:16:30] <RustIndy> is there a way to get the actual text used for a CSS attribute? ie. $("#thing").width() returns the calculated width, and $("#thing").css("width") returns the width in pixels, but how can i get the actual text used in the CSS file for #thing{width:25%;} - in other words, i need the "25%" text
[12:16:34] <VictorCl2> what's the best way to detect if i am on an iphone or android¿?
[12:16:41] <brettster> my bad dude!
[12:16:44] <brettster> I got confused!
[12:16:57] <rue> You're also forgiven for confusing the caps lock key for… something
[12:17:03] <brettster> oh man
[12:17:05] <brettster> caps lock
[12:17:08] <brettster> what's that?
[12:17:09] <sean`> I USE SHIFT
[12:17:31] <SeanFallon> -.-
[12:17:34] <catcher> I default to caps and use lowerlock.
[12:17:52] <anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/anphonic/MyfJ4/  I need to NOT use the have the tracking pixles added to the slideshow
[12:17:58] <abnormalex> VictorCl2: generally, if everything sucks and you paid way too much money, your probably on an iphone
[12:18:23] <anphonic> some articles have no images but they all have the tracking pixel. The import adds a class to all imported images
[12:19:41] <anphonic> wow, i just read the first part of that
[12:19:56] <anphonic> I need to filter out the tracking pixles from the slideshow
[12:20:36] <Eviltwin> brettster: Just because you use jQuery somewhere in your page does not mean every issue is a jQuery issue.
[12:20:55] <Eviltwin> What you are talking about is simultaneously specific to a plugin and specific to the Vimeo player
[12:22:16] <pajo> how can i set datepickers first week day from sunday to monday? preferably global setting?
[12:22:43] <Eviltwin> brettster: I suggest you look here to figure out how to add callbacks when the slide changes: http://webbies.dk/SudoSlider/help/#Settings
[12:23:01] <Eviltwin> brettster: And here to see how to manipulate the Vimeo players: http://vimeo.com/api/docs/player-js
[12:24:04] <Eviltwin> Expecting us to go track down and read through a bunch of documentation for you so you don't have to is not a reasonable thing to request
[12:24:12] <b-lew> blah, even when i take out everything it still weird
[12:25:12] <Eviltwin> brettster: An example of using callbacks is at the bottom here: http://webbies.dk/SudoSlider/help/#Designers%20guide
[12:25:27] <RustIndy> is there a way to get the actual text used for a CSS attribute? ie. $("#thing").width() returns the calculated width, and $("#thing").css("width") returns the width in pixels, but how can i get the actual text used in the CSS file for #thing{width:25%;} - in other words, i need the "25%" text
[12:25:50] <abnormalex> does this look right
[12:25:51] <abnormalex> $.post('scripts/login.php', $('#formLogin').serialize(), function(data) {
[12:25:51] <abnormalex> 			   alert("Data Loaded: " + data);
[12:26:08] <Eviltwin> brettster: We'd appreciate it if you would now take a little time to look through these resources and try a little more to solve the problem youself given this new information
[12:26:34] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: Looks like valid syntax
[12:26:46] <Eviltwin> Assuming a }); after that
[12:26:51] <abnormalex> yeah
[12:26:53] <gnarf> RustIndy: you can't get the 25% reliably cross-browser
[12:27:01] <abnormalex> the post part works, i gont get the alert though
[12:27:19] <gnarf> although
[12:27:28] <gnarf> lemme see here i have some code that does something similar i think
[12:27:28] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: Have you used Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools before?
[12:27:56] <abnormalex> yeah ill try
[12:28:15] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Just need to parse the style sheets and use Sizzle to see what selectors apply to what
[12:29:34] <brettster> thank you.
[12:29:50] <RustIndy> gnarf: document.styleSheets looks pretty cross-platform, isn't it?
[12:30:11] <Eviltwin> brettster: We try to help people here but there's a limit to how much help we can provide for any individual
[12:30:21] <brettster> this is perfect.
[12:30:22] <Eviltwin> Especially since we're not getting paid for this and have other things we need to spend time on
[12:30:22] <brettster> thanks.
[12:30:47] <b-lew> any reason why these 2 images that link to fancy box aren't working?
[12:30:49] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/
[12:31:06] <Eviltwin> Just linking us to a page and asking how to fix some issue is usually going to take familiarity with the code you wrote and the plugins involved
[12:31:22] <Eviltwin> Which we usually don't have time to do when it's this involved
[12:31:31] <b-lew> okay
[12:31:40] <Eviltwin> So we either want people to isolate the issue in a jsFiddle
[12:31:41] <b-lew> well never mind then.
[12:31:51] <b-lew> well I've done that already
[12:31:56] <b-lew> I can revert back to that
[12:32:05] <b-lew> I'm basically having a problem with fancybox
[12:32:11] <Eviltwin> Or really nail down the issue
[12:32:18] <Eviltwin> b-lew: That was all in response to brettster
[12:32:24] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/fancybox.html the plugin works here
[12:32:42] <b-lew> but it's not working on this page. http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/
[12:32:44] <b-lew> oh okay haha
[12:32:45] <b-lew> sorry
[12:32:59] <Eviltwin> b-lew: I see it working identically in both places, actually
[12:33:08] <b-lew> maybe its my cache?
[12:33:26] <Eviltwin> It's producing the same behavior but not the behavior you want
[12:33:34] <b-lew> oh i see
[12:33:38] <b-lew> hummm
[12:33:51] <b-lew> okay
[12:34:09] <Eviltwin> I'm guessing they don't want you to hot link to http://fancybox.net/js/fancybox-1.3.4/*
[12:34:17] <Eviltwin> I think you need to download those and host them yourself
[12:34:21] <Eviltwin> They're getting 403'd
[12:34:54] <erebel55> has anyone ever done any zooming to a specific component? I'm trying to wrap my head around zooming to a selected component, so that it is zoomed to a point where it covers the whole screen
[12:35:02] <erebel55> this is what i have right http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/44/
[12:35:20] <RustIndy> Eviltwin: document.styleSheets[0].ownerNode.textContent gets me the raw text of the first stylesheet. there's a way to use Sizzle to parse that?
[12:35:38] <b-lew> Eviltwin: can you refresh by any chance?
[12:35:40] <Eviltwin> RustIndy: No, you'd still have to parse it oyurself
[12:35:46] <b-lew> its working but my video isn't working
[12:35:49] <Eviltwin> RustIndy: But Sizzle will let you see if elements match CSS selectors
[12:35:50] <RustIndy> ouch
[12:35:54] <RustIndy> ah
[12:35:58] <Eviltwin> (Or find a parser for it)
[12:36:02] <Eviltwin> Google around
[12:36:03] <abnormalex> i cant tell if this is working... $.post('scripts/logout.php', $('#formLogin').serialize());
[12:36:27] <Eviltwin> b-lew: Well this is still broken for me: http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/fancybox.html
[12:36:41] <Soopaman> does anyone know what cost there is to insert svg items into a web page?
[12:37:03] <McBoingBo> can someone help me hide these bullets from a jqueryui tab? tried slapping list-style:none; all over the place but isnt taking so far.....
[12:37:22] <Soopaman> been playing around with using svg's to replace raster images in an attempt to counter hidpi displays
[12:37:25] <b-lew> Eviltwin: true. thats weird... it worked 20 mins ago
[12:37:41] <b-lew> I'm just not for sure how to get the video to work in the gallery
[12:38:09] <Eviltwin> b-lew: I'm getting this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4941002/fancybox-returning-the-requested-content-cannot-be-loaded-please-try-again-la
[12:38:18] <Eviltwin> It suggests using rel="fancyvideo"

[12:39:07] <abnormalex> my login script ends with $message
[12:39:21] <abnormalex> id like to show the message without refreshing

[12:42:56] <Eviltwin> And in the fiddle as well
[12:42:59] <sodapop> how can i get a jquery element in array like list_items.push($(this));

[12:43:23] <Eviltwin> They don't want you to do that
[12:43:53] <b-lew> well i know, I have everything locally now. but am still getting that error for my video.
[12:43:59] <b-lew> Can't seem to fix that for some reason
[12:44:06] <Eviltwin> sodapop: I don't understand the question
[12:44:13] <b-lew> I'll keep trying... been an "all day" project
[12:45:05] <Eviltwin> I would start by downloading those JS and CSS files and actually hosting them yourself
[12:45:13] <Eviltwin> And change the references to your local copies
[12:45:20] <b-lew> I am... http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/ haha
[12:45:38] <b-lew> that was a test to see if the functionality would even work
[12:45:42] <sodapop> Eviltwin: i want get each li from a list and store it for later use (but not just the text)
[12:45:44] <Eviltwin> b-lew: Then try the StackOverflow suggestion
[12:46:03] <Eviltwin> sodapop: So what's not working about what you suggested?
[12:47:05] <b-lew> haha now the video isn't getting an error its blank
[12:53:57] <b-lew> that makes no sense

[13:06:25] <esiegel> Good afternoon, I have an element a bit down the page that I would like to become fixed to the top of the page when a user scrolls down to it.
[13:06:36] <esiegel> What is the best way for me to do this using jQuery?
[13:06:48] <esiegel> Something with .scrollTop?
[13:06:59] <rbennacer> hey guys
[13:07:09] <Taar779> Hello, is there a way to "animate" the window/elements when you jump to an element with window.location?
[13:07:17] <rbennacer> can anyone explian why new Date(5000).getHours() => 19?
[13:07:22] <rbennacer> it should be 0 right?
[13:07:48] <sumeetjain> I'd like to loop through the LIs in a list and - when I reach the last LI - continue with the first LI. Is there a best practice for that?
[13:08:12] <NoiseEee> rbennacer: new Date(5000)?
[13:08:26] <NoiseEee> rbennacer: what are you trying to do?
[13:09:23] <NoiseEee> rbennacer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[13:10:24] <rbennacer> i want to know how many hours are in 5000 seconds
[13:10:51] <NoiseEee> rbennacer: thats not the way to use the Date object
[13:11:01] <rbennacer> how can i do what i want?
[13:11:13] <klocatelli> division
[13:11:14] <ctk> hi all
[13:11:14] <NoiseEee> rbennacer: basic math really.  how many seconds are in an hour?
[13:11:43] <ctk> any thoughts on a cleaner way to do this? var curItems = this.jc.children('ul').children('li').length; where jc is a div?
[13:11:45] <Jon47> if you pass it a single integer as a parameter, it expects for you to give it the number of milliseconds since the unix epoch, i think
[13:11:57] <rbennacer> i want something  more reliable than waht i do
[13:12:07] <esiegel> rbennacer: probably just do 5000/60/60, I think.
[13:12:29] <paniwani> can anyone recommend a jquery image caption library?
[13:12:54] <asidjazz> caption?
[13:13:24] <klocatelli> more reliable than math?
[13:13:26] <paniwani> asidjazz: like a transparent image caption with details that pops up as u scroll over the image
[13:14:22] <olinux> paniwani, popeye is kinda slick slideshow http://dev.herr-schuessler.de/jquery/popeye/demo.html
[13:14:29] <asidjazz> ah
[13:16:02] <olinux> paniwani, this is nice too http://buildinternet.com/2009/03/sliding-boxes-and-captions-with-jquery/
[13:18:01] <clone1018> Hey, having a little problem with the jquery $.post method, here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/93nQs/ at the post destination, $_POST displays nothing
[13:19:06] <paniwani> olinux: i tried playing with that second one, mosaic, but couldn't figure out how to set up the html correctly
[13:19:21] <paniwani> olinux: they had a bunch of mosaic specific classes that weren't mentioned anywhere
[13:19:40] <olinux> paniwani, i use it one one of my sites
[13:19:53] <olinux> but i think not the plugin just the sample code
[13:20:54] <clone1018> Oh, hey, I'm retarded, how are you?
[13:21:42] <paniwani> olinux: so besides calling .mosaic in jquery, how do u mark up the overlay
[13:21:47] <DowHealthDevices> Hello, I am the chief Biosoftware Strategy Engineer of Dow's health devices unit.
[13:21:56] <DowHealthDevices> We need a way to alert the ER staff that a patient's orthostatic pressure has changed by more than 20mmHg. Alert boxes and popups don't seem to be working and we're worried this is affecting the utility of our new Web-based solution.
[13:22:13] <b-lew> Eviltwin: the video isn't playing but its not throwing that error now
[13:22:58] <paniwani> olinux: i think its making some sense now. i'll give it another shot
[13:23:00] <ajpiano> DowHealthDevices: have you considered like, making some sound
[13:23:25] <DowHealthDevices> ajpiano: That's a good idea, but a lot of the workstations lack speakers.
[13:23:28] <ajpiano> that seems to be a popular thing for devices in hospitals to do
[13:23:33] <clone1018> DowHealthDevices: red flashing lights?
[13:23:38] <axilla> DowHealthDevices: Notifications?
[13:23:44] <axilla> SMS or e-Mail?
[13:23:48] <DowHealthDevices> ajpiano: Something like Chrome's webkitNotification would be good.
[13:23:51] <DowHealthDevices> clone1018: Perfect!
[13:23:55] <axilla> do your nurses carry some type of device?
[13:24:05] <DowHealthDevices> axilla: No.
[13:24:12] <axilla> i know a lot of nurses use iPad's these days
[13:24:13] <clone1018> DowHealthDevices: think stupid sci-fi movie, when they're alerted of something, it'll be perfect.
[13:24:31] <axilla> then move into 2012
[13:24:35] <axilla> geez
[13:24:47] <axilla> doctors/nurses should have digital patient info
[13:24:48] <axilla> in hand
[13:24:54] <axilla> why are we still killing trees?
[13:25:00] <clone1018> axilla: from what I can tell, this isnt this companies problem
[13:25:02] <ajpiano> axilla: HIPAA
[13:25:06] <DowHealthDevices> axilla: They prefer typewritten records.
[13:25:43] <axilla> That's like surgeouns who think that robotic surgery won't replace "real surgeons"
[13:25:56] <axilla> or assembly line guy who thought robots wouldn't replace the human in automating of tasks
[13:26:04] <DowHealthDevices> axilla: True.
[13:26:06] <Bertl> when I do a .load("xyz.html") what happens with <script src=...> stuff in xyz.html ?
[13:26:20] <axilla> you either get on board or die.
[13:26:21] <axilla> seriously
[13:26:33] <DowHealthDevices> Most will die.
[13:26:37] <axilla> companies like Intuitive Surgical are going to crush surgeons who don't adapt
[13:26:43] <axilla> same goes for people who want type written documents
[13:26:45] <axilla> etc, etc
[13:26:56] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/ -> if you click the images at the top... is there a reason the video isn't working? I'm not getting an error to go by
[13:27:11] <axilla> just saying.. imagine if your nurses were required to carry an ipad
[13:27:19] <axilla> not only could you send a Push notification
[13:27:24] <axilla> but you could play a noise
[13:27:33] <axilla> they could pull up video of the patient right there
[13:27:39] <axilla> grab their charts
[13:27:44] <axilla> look at exrays
[13:27:52] <axilla> instead lets spend all day walking around to the different wings
[13:28:09] <axilla> just sayin
[13:28:10] <axilla> :)
[13:28:52] <axilla> but what do i know... i'm starting a cookie company =/ lol
[13:29:05] <b-lew> haha me too
[13:29:07] <b-lew> i like cookies
[13:29:09] <Zzaichik> mmmm coookies..
[13:29:12] <b-lew> less hassle
[13:29:44] <Bertl> sorry, is this the cookie channel? :)
[13:29:49] <b-lew> blah
[13:29:49] <axilla> yes!
[13:30:04] <Bertl> ah, I must have mistyped jquery then  ...
[13:30:46] <DowHealthDevices> axilla: The hospital is broke. :(
[13:30:48] <b-lew> jquery = cookies
[13:31:23] <DowHealthDevices> No money for tech upgrades. The computers are 15 year old IBMs running Windows NT 4
[13:33:06] <ajpiano> DowHealthDevices: so you are planning to have this all run in ie 6 or lower, then?
[13:33:34] <DowHealthDevices> ajpiano: No, we are using Chrome now through VNc
[13:33:39] <drewby> if I do jQuery(function(){...}); when does that execute?
[13:33:45] <DowHealthDevices> err, Firefox
[13:33:53] <ajpiano> DowHealthDevices: ahh, phew
[13:33:57] <DowHealthDevices> Firefox and some IE 8 stuff
[13:34:08] <NoiseEee> i'd hate to be in that hospital when the wifi goes down
[13:34:13] <NoiseEee> can i get the name of that hospital please?
[13:34:17] <NoiseEee> so i know what to avoid?
[13:34:50] <DowHealthDevices> NoiseEee: Never get sick in a town named Springfield.
[13:35:15] <NoiseEee> not a problem, i do most of my living/travelling in shelbyville
[13:35:42] <koesbong> drewby: that's the shortcut for $(document).ready(function() {});
[13:36:26] <koesbong> drewby: so that would execute after the DOM is fully loaded per http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:37:24] <Bertl> can I execute a script from content dynamically loaded (.load()) from some html file after it was loaded? i.e. some kind of initialize included in that html?
[13:49:15] <juha-> http://userpics.com/coding_drunk.jpg
[13:49:51] <eirikb> Best way to do cross domain post without proxy? I think it might be CORS (with polyfill). Correct?
[13:49:55] <techouse> hmm, question
[13:50:54] <techouse> i got 3 lists, all have the same class name but different ids and all have the same elements (names and classes) now i what i wanna do is hover 1 li in a list and that should in turn animate all lis in the same line
[13:51:03] <crivera> how do you prevent the alert from being executed in something like this: $("div").html(alert('hi'));
[13:51:43] <crivera> we're trying to update the dom with a users name.  if a user sets his name to something like alert('xxx') then it'll screw with our system
[13:51:51] <erebel55> has anyone ever done a zoom to component? this is what I have so far but i'm trying to figure out how to fix it up http://jsfiddle.net/6Jg2A/3/

[13:56:01] <aarobc_work1> hello all, I'm trying to use $.ajax to post an array, but it's not working. I'm not sure if that's even possible, but the documentation suggests that it is; would somebody here be able to clarify if such a thing is possible?
[13:57:33] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work1: It is possible
[13:57:46] <Eviltwin> We have the technology
[13:59:17] <Zzaichik> …to rebuild him
[14:00:28] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: is this the right idea, or am I doing it wrong? https://gist.github.com/2243749
[14:01:38] <DowHealthDevices> Madonna loves me right now.
[14:01:41] <Zzaichik> indent your shit, for christ's sake.
[14:01:51] <Zzaichik> ..That sounded mean
[14:01:52] <ajpiano> DowHealthDevices: :|||
[14:02:03] <aroc> Does anyone know a way to prevent stopPropagation from preventing child element events from taking place. I thought it was inly supposed to prevent bubbling up to the parent?
[14:02:10] <ajpiano> i had a feeling you were not actually who you said you were
[14:02:20] <NoiseEee> DowHealthDevices: wait, you're from detroit right
[14:02:26] <DowHealthDevices> NoiseEee: Yeah.
[14:02:36] <NoiseEee> DowHealthDevices: damned if i can't call you / spot you in every channel you go on!!
[14:02:41] <wunz> hi, i'm trying to hide an element when its value equls some text; however, its not working
[14:02:44] <wunz> http://jsfiddle.net/gQSwh/1/
[14:02:50] <wunz> what am i doing wrong?
[14:03:04] <DowHealthDevices> ;-)
[14:03:05] <NoiseEee> DowHealthDevices: you can prolong the anonymity longer if you don't reference Madonna, fwiw
[14:03:13] <ajpiano> or detroit
[14:03:13] <aarobc_work1> Zzaichik: i copy/pasted that from my editor, it seems that gist doesn't allow you to indent highlighted blocks of code.
[14:03:17] <ajpiano> those are the deadgiveaways
[14:03:35] <Zzaichik> poor, sad gist.
[14:03:46] <DowHealthDevices> What if I mention Bay City, MI? :)
[14:04:12] <wunz> can someone help me out?
[14:04:18] * DowHealthDevices has deprecated Detroit in favor of the Great Lakes Bay Region.
[14:05:43] <koesbong> wunz: http://jsfiddle.net/gQSwh/2/
[14:06:24] <koesbong> wunz: optimized a bit - http://jsfiddle.net/gQSwh/3/
[14:06:42] <DowHealthDevices> So, I figured out the solution to getting a web app notification to pop up over all other windows and notifications: A signed Java applet can bring up a modal window that is in front of all windows.
[14:06:51] <wunz> what was i doing wrong in mine?
[14:07:04] <koesbong> $(this) was not what you thought it was
[14:07:48] <wunz> var $this = $(this); <-- can you explain that part to me?
[14:08:13] <koesbong> wunz: i am just caching $(this) to a variable so it doesn't keep looking it up every time
[14:08:35] <wunz> ah ok
[14:08:42] <wunz> you're a life save, thanks man!
[14:09:03] <koesbong> np
[14:10:08] <esiegel> Hey everyone, I'm looking for a way to lock an element to the top of the page when a user scrolls to it.
[14:10:18] <esiegel> Is there a best practice for this?
[14:10:49] <DowHealthDevices> esiegel: position:fixed?
[14:11:09] <esiegel> Right, but I'd like it be position:relative until the user scrolls past it.
[14:12:18] <esiegel> So basically, function() { $(#foo).addClass("fixed") }; where .fixed (position:fixed) [among other things]
[14:12:33] <esiegel> $("#foo")
[14:12:33] <arcticseal> I'm having difficulty getting UI slider to work in a rails 3 app.  I do have the correct jquery and custom ui js in my header.  When I try to use .slider I am told it is not a function.  Any insights?

[14:19:49] <mrFrog> Firefox seems so slow for jQuery animations… Is that just me? For example, I'm trying to use the masonry plugin (demo on the front page: http://masonry.desandro.com/) in chrome, it runs perfectly smoothly, in firefox, it's so slow I can't use it. Are animation heavy jQuery plugins just no good on firefox?...
[14:28:06] <ngharo> mrFrog: do you have a background image by chance?
[14:28:37] <mrFrog> ngharo: nope, and I even tried it on the plugin page: http://masonry.desandro.com/ to be sure it wasn't something to do with my own page
[14:29:28] <ngharo> snappy here
[14:29:40] <koesbong> mrFrog: just tried on my chrome and ff, looks smooth to me
[14:29:51] <koesbong> what FF version do you have?
[14:29:54] <mrFrog> alright guess it's something with my computer then
[14:30:11] <mrFrog> i have 10.0.2, it's updating now that I checked :)
[14:30:34] <koesbong> i have 11
[14:32:04] <mrFrog> koesbong: ok i updated to 11, still lagging - you guys are resizing the window on that page right? to cause the animation
[14:32:17] <miket3> Dec 21st, 2012  remove all IE work-arounds from your code.  Spread the word!!! :)
[14:32:19] <koesbong> mrFrog: yep resizing all over the place
[14:33:00] <anphonic> man, ##php is kinda stuck up
[14:33:25] <ngharo> mrFrog: maybe you have an extension borking it
[14:33:42] <aarobc_work1> anphonic: though to be honest, they've helped me more than people have even helped me here...
[14:33:45] <mrFrog> ngharo: i disabled all of them, and then i even removed all of them (and restarted browser), still lagging for me
[14:34:15] <anphonic> yeah but sometimes a big part of learning is working on older code
[14:34:21] <anphonic> or other people code
[14:34:30] <miket3> anphonic, i used feedgator once.. it was good for one feed and bad for a 2nd one so i stopped right there
[14:34:53] <KasperKRK> how i can put var to left side table? Looks like here ->  http://jsfiddle.net/xT7YB/   ?
[14:35:16] <anphonic> it works great for us
[14:36:10] <ngharo> KasperKRK: huh?
[14:36:10] <aarobc_work1> so I need some help posting an array, is that even possible?
[14:36:10] <aarobc_work1> 	$.post("test.php",
[14:36:10] <aarobc_work1> 			{"dat[]":dat});
[14:36:10] <aarobc_work1> is this syntaxically correct or no? Could somebody help clarify this for me?
[14:36:14] <anphonic> I just need to make it not strip tracking pixles AND set up the main images so it works right
[14:36:46] <miket3> aarjona, $_POST is an array
[14:36:57] <miket3> so just posting in itself is an array
[14:37:18] <miket3> if you setup your var   as var[]  you will get an array of valiues
[14:37:44] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work1: Read this page: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[14:37:54] <aarobc_work1> miket3: so in my example, dat is an aray
[14:38:24] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work1: It shows how you work with arrays in parameters
[14:38:27] <miket3> aarjona, see Eviltwin link
[14:38:31] <Eviltwin> It's what $.ajax uses to serialize structures
[14:39:28] <mrFrog> koesbong: you don't happen to be on a mac do you? i tried it out on a windows machine i have and it only barely lagged.
[14:39:40] <koesbong> mrFrog: on a mac  :)
[14:39:50] <mrFrog> oh gosh this is so strange...
[14:41:06] <KasperKRK> ngharo, i want put varchar to array from string, but I don't know how.
[14:42:00] <raj> I'm trying to get an img preview prior to uploading (after adding the file) using canvas http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/how-to-develop-a-html5-image-uploader/ . However, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I've got the live code here--> http://68.46.138.78:8080/asdf  (asdf:asdf to login). The relevant js code is in profilepic_upload.js (lines 50-62)
[14:42:22] <ngharo> KasperKRK: I still don't understand what you mean 0_o
[14:43:10] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: so this doesn't work either then:
[14:43:10] <aarobc_work1> 		$.post("ajax/billEdit.php",
[14:43:10] <aarobc_work1> 			$.param(dat));
[14:43:48] <raj> oh, you need to click the Change Picture link on the picture
[14:44:23] <ngharo> KasperKRK: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/xT7YB/1/ this?
[14:44:27] <KasperKRK> http://jsfiddle.net/WGg9P/
[14:44:45] <ngharo> KasperKRK: gotcha, check out my link
[14:44:59] <KasperKRK> ngharo, Sorry for my english, and thanks :)
[14:46:22] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work1: The point was not for you to call $.param, the point was for you to READ the examples on that page
[14:46:27] <Eviltwin> And how it serializes structures
[14:48:36] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: Indeed, I understand this, but even then, if it's not in a format that jquery is expecting for $.post() then it does me no good.
[14:49:20] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work1: How about this, try running $.param() with your data
[14:49:24] <Eviltwin> And show me what it produces
[14:52:41] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: okay, according to console.log($.param(dat)); it actually does nothing at all, even though
[14:52:41] <aarobc_work1> 		for(a in dat){console.log(a + ", " + dat[a]);}
[14:52:41] <aarobc_work1> does indeed output the entire contents, so I know that the array is valid, but the function doesn't seem to do anything.
[14:53:40] <Eviltwin> Why have you change the way you were parameterizing
[14:53:45] <Eviltwin> What does dat look like?
[14:56:07] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: it's just an associative array the for loop would output:
[14:56:07] <aarobc_work1> day, today
[14:56:07] <aarobc_work1> status, green
[14:56:07] <aarobc_work1> etc...
[14:56:58] <Eviltwin> ?js $.param({"day": "today", "status": "green"});
[14:56:59] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "day=today&status=green"
[14:57:45] <Eviltwin> You're not getting that?
[14:58:08] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: nope, it just outputs nothing at all.
[14:58:26] <Eviltwin> Then you must be doing something really weird (or wrong)
[14:58:43] <Eviltwin> Can you reproduce this in a jsFiddle?
[14:59:40] <aarobc_work1> Eviltwin: I'll see, give me a sec
[15:00:12] <SVetter> hi everyone!
[15:00:26] <SVetter> how do I listen to a "submit" button of a html form?
[15:00:39] <Eviltwin> SVetter: You can listen to the click event of the button or the submit event of the form
[15:01:06] <SVetter> how would the submit event be listened to?
[15:01:15] <SVetter> (thanks by the way! :) )
[15:01:45] <Eviltwin> SVetter: You would select the form and then use .submit(function(event) { ... }) or .on("submit", function(event) { ... })
[15:02:23] <SVetter> thank you!
[15:02:45] <Eviltwin> If you don't know how to do that: Read this: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[15:03:06] <SVetter> okay, I just tried google ;)
[15:10:04] <SVetter> a general question: Was the "selecting" of items possible before jQuery?
[15:10:17] <Eviltwin> Possible but not easy
[15:10:24] <SVetter> I see
[15:10:25] <SVetter> wow
[15:10:26] <Eviltwin> At least not easy for complicated selectors
[15:10:47] <SVetter> I have only started to get into it a few weeks ago
[15:10:53] <SVetter> so it really IS a big thing
[15:10:58] <SVetter> not just an "addon"
[15:11:00] <Eviltwin> The syntax originated with CSS
[15:11:07] <Eviltwin> It's what CSS uses to style particular elements
[15:11:08] <SVetter> I see
[15:16:58] <SVetter> hmmmm
[15:17:40] <SVetter> so if I select that button
[15:17:56] <SVetter> and when it is submitted, I want to suppress the default behavior
[15:18:30] <koesbong> SVetter: .submit(function(e) {e.preventDefault();})
[15:18:33] <SVetter> I would do $('form.url_entry').submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault() ;}
[15:18:51] <SVetter> okay
[15:18:56] <SVetter> cool
[15:19:04] <SVetter> half way through :D
[15:20:45] <miket3> Does ANYTHING work in IE?
[15:21:31] <silverwind> tables.
[15:22:19] <EchoBravo> ugh okay
[15:22:24] <EchoBravo> i need some sort of
[15:22:31] <EchoBravo> magical jquery unicorn to help me out
[15:23:22] <EchoBravo> i have some content that's being refreshed via ajax.  once it's refreshed, the bound-to elements inside of that markup loose their bindings.
[15:23:35] <aarobc_work1> I too, would apriciate a magical jquery unicorn.
[15:23:46] <EchoBravo> self.changeButtons.on({ click: function () { return self._handleAddBtnClick($(this)); } });
[15:23:49] <miket3> EchoBravo, use delegate()
[15:24:00] <EchoBravo> my understanding is that the new on() does the same as delegate
[15:24:28] <EchoBravo> as far as late binding, anyway
[15:24:33] <miket3> i wouldnt know.   but delegate works for me.  i only used it once
[15:24:54] <EchoBravo> i did try delegate, and had the same problem.
[15:25:20] <EchoBravo> switched back to on() because the dox suggest that it is just a more extensible version
[15:26:42] <miket3> EchoBravo, sorry, i am not magical unicorn
[15:26:55] <EchoBravo> VERY DISAPPOINTING
[15:27:13] <EchoBravo> thanks for trying, though  :}
[15:27:25] <miket3> EchoBravo, i am more like un-magical donkey

[15:29:24] <nFFF> or do you need help?

[15:30:04] <miket3> nope... its a magical unicorn
[15:30:23] <beancurd> magical as in dildo strapped to horse's head?
[15:30:30] <miket3> LOLLL
[15:30:40] <SVetter> awwww :( that button sill triggers the form default
[15:30:44] <miket3> beancurd, im crying
[15:31:16] <SVetter> do I have to select the form or the submit button?
[15:31:35] <_ramo> does anyone has an idea?
[15:31:58] <koesbong> SVetter, if you want to catch the submit event, then the form
[15:32:12] <Zzaichik> _ramo:  the close / closedialog doesn't work?
[15:32:18] <SVetter> I don't know if I want to catch that :D
[15:32:23] <SVetter> I just figured it would be smart
[15:32:31] <koesbong> yeah, it would be
[15:32:39] <Zzaichik> **dialogclose**
[15:32:48] <SVetter> the situation is: I have a div with a toggled visibility
[15:32:54] <SVetter> and inside that div there is a form
[15:33:04] <koesbong> can you jsfiddle it?
[15:33:07] <SVetter> if the user enters stuff there
[15:33:19] <SVetter> I want the DIV to reload, not the whole form
[15:33:25] <SVetter> and I thought I would select the form
[15:33:33] <SVetter> stop if from default action
[15:33:39] <SVetter> then submit the form via ajax
[15:33:42] <SVetter> and refresh the div
[15:33:48] <_ramo> Zzaichik: i have this code: http://privatepaste.com/a84a5982ea/asdfsadfdsaf   and i want the dialog to close if i click on a link
[15:34:12] <SVetter> koesbong, just a sec. me = googling jsfiddle
[15:34:13] <SVetter> :D
[15:34:16] <pifantastic> $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog("close")

[15:37:42] <Zzaichik> .dialog('close'); should work, I'd think.
[15:38:10] <SVetter> I get an error message in js Fiddle
[15:38:14] <SVetter> can I post that here?
[15:38:26] <pifantastic> no, link to the fiddle
[15:38:29] <pifantastic> we would get the same error message
[15:38:43] <y3di> someone needs to help me figure out how apple did this: http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/#ambient-smartcover
[15:39:07] <SVetter> http://jsfiddle.net/bEDET/
[15:39:19] <SVetter> oh
[15:39:21] <SVetter> false
[15:39:28] <SVetter> this is the version where I selected the button
[15:39:50] <Zzaichik> y3di: it's cycling through images depending on mouse position
[15:39:50] <Eviltwin> y3di: It's a sequence of images
[15:39:59] <SVetter> but if you change url_submit to url_entry, the error will be the same
[15:40:27] <pifantastic> SVetter: that selector is wrong
[15:40:41] <pifantastic> $("#url_entry")
[15:40:55] <pifantastic> you need the hash in there to show that it is an ID
[15:41:06] <SVetter> :D :D
[15:41:07] <SVetter> ok
[15:41:11] <SVetter> rooky
[15:41:12] <SVetter> :-/
[15:41:22] <pifantastic> indeed
[15:41:32] <SVetter> hm
[15:41:39] <SVetter> still the same error message though
[15:41:43] <SVetter> *snif*
[15:41:45] <SVetter> :(
[15:42:12] <nFFF> works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/bEDET/1/
[15:42:29] <SVetter> yeah
[15:42:31] <SVetter> got it
[15:42:36] <SVetter> wooo hooooo
[15:42:36] <SVetter> :)
[15:42:58] <y3di> ah, thanks Zzaichik and Eviltwin, makes sense
[15:43:12] <SVetter> thank you guys!
[15:43:12] <rbd> hey guys... I have a keypress event handler registered on $(window)/$(document). I want to NOT catch F1-F12 events, but I see that F5 for instance has event.which set to 116, which is the same as 't' ... how can I differenciate this?

[15:46:02] <Zzaichik> nein
[15:47:53] <EchoBravo> nFFF: sorry about the delay, i had to walk away for a minute  :}
[15:48:05] <EchoBravo> still having the problem, though.
[15:48:39] <nFFF> what problem?
[15:48:49] <nFFF> If you want to bind to dynamically loaded content
[15:48:50] <EchoBravo> late binding..
[15:48:52] <nFFF> bind to the parent
[15:48:57] <nFFF> and check for child
[15:49:20] <EchoBravo> the first parent who is not dynamically refreshed?
[15:49:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:49:49] <nFFF> examplar: $('.parent-thats-loaded-on-page-load').on('click', '.child-dynamic', function() { });
[15:49:51] <Eviltwin> Take advantage of event delegation
[15:49:54] <Eviltwin> It's described on this page: see ?on
[15:49:55] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[15:57:39] <Eviltwin> sammmy: ...what about them?
[15:58:01] <sammmy> Eviltwin: Is it as simple as $elem.trigger('mycustomevent')?
[15:58:04] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:58:55] <sammmy> nice. And all I need to do is .on('mycustomevent') to attach a handler?
[16:01:31] <abnormalex> i need help understanding how to return data from jquery ajax call
[16:01:37] <abnormalex> i am using  success:function(data) {
[16:01:37] <abnormalex>          return data;
[16:01:37] <abnormalex>       }
[16:01:47] <abnormalex> but that is returning me a huge page, full of html markup
[16:02:04] <LakWork> well then it sounds like your ajax request is returning a full page
[16:02:34] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Liked the slide transition from jQuery Mobile 1.0? We heard you. For RC2: slide (like 1.0) and slidefade (1.1 style) - http://t.co/mQapMIlP ★ http://bit.ly/HpkLvd
[16:02:34] <abnormalex> right, but the .php script its calling is only running a function, which is returning a small array from mysql
[16:03:23] <pifantastic> ?p @ abnormalex
[16:03:24] <bot-t> abnormalex, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:04:57] <nFFF> not sure if you can do that in aysonchronous abnormalex
[16:06:52] <gnarf> abnormalex: you don't return data from an asynchronus call
[16:06:55] <gnarf> you call callbacks
[16:06:55] <abnormalex> http://pastie.org/3694858
[16:07:04] <abnormalex> there are 3 different files in that pastie (its very short)
[16:07:32] <abnormalex> im not really sure the right step i need to take... do i need JSON?
[16:08:06] <pifantastic> abnormalex: lots of things wrong bro
[16:08:23] <abnormalex> k
[16:08:32] <pifantastic> abnormalex: You are returning an array from getPages()
[16:08:49] <abnormalex> right
[16:08:53] <pifantastic> but an Ajax request expects certain data
[16:08:56] <pifantastic> it can be html
[16:08:57] <pifantastic> xml
[16:08:59] <pifantastic> or json
[16:09:10] <pifantastic> depending on the header you send along with that data
[16:09:20] <pifantastic> and what you specify in the options for the ajax request
[16:09:28] <gnarf> in that particular case - i would say use json_encode() to transmit the array from php, and use dataType: "json" in the ajax call
[16:09:31] <pifantastic> right now, you are not outputting anything
[16:09:33] <abnormalex> ok, id like to try json
[16:09:39] <pifantastic> gnarf is correct
[16:09:44] <abnormalex> i tried json_encode, but the output was strange
[16:10:57] <abnormalex> return json_encode($result);
[16:11:43] <abnormalex> "[{\"pageID\":\"1\",\"0\":\"1\",\"pageName\":\"test\",\"1\":\"test\"}]"
[16:12:06] <abnormalex> maybe i shouldnt use fetchall
[16:13:13] <Eviltwin> Try echoing it
[16:13:37] <abnormalex> PDO::FETCH_ASSOC gives me a bit better: "{\"pageID\":\"1\",\"pageName\":\"test\"}"
[16:14:35] <Eviltwin> Is this coming from SQL?
[16:14:39] <abnormalex> yeah
[16:14:44] <Eviltwin> mysql_fetch_array?
[16:14:51] <abnormalex> $query = $connect->prepare("SELECT pageID, pageName FROM pages");   $result = $query->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);   echo json_encode(getPages($connect));
[16:15:00] <abnormalex> thats 3 lines
[16:15:04] <Eviltwin> Oh, yeah, you want the associative-only array
[16:16:40] <coldhead> is this ##php? i thought i was banned from there
[16:16:45] <coldhead> good times
[16:17:19] <Eviltwin> Fuck PHP, man
[16:19:01] <abnormalex> Eviltwin: so im doing it right?
[16:20:07] <Eviltwin> Should work based on what you've shown
[16:20:14] <jh1> hey there. Can i use the has selector like this: object:visible:has(param[flashvars*="vimeo"]) ?
[16:20:23] <Eviltwin> Sure
[16:20:25] <Eviltwin> Well
[16:20:38] <Eviltwin> I think there are some issues with selectors and <object> elements
[16:20:42] <Eviltwin> I'd google around
[16:20:49] <Eviltwin> But with otther elements I know that'd work fine as a selector
[16:22:49] <ravenzz> be sure that it is already in the DOM, it could have been generated in js
[16:23:02] <jh1> yes it is
[16:23:07] <jh1> but wont be found
[16:24:33] <ravenzz> you should share a link then
[16:26:41] <jrockjiggz> jh1: i'm sorry, could you not just object[flashvars*=vimeo]:visible ?
[16:27:52] <ravenzz> usually the flashvars are a param's attribute
[16:28:18] <owen1> when i curl 0.0.0.0:4000/refresh/0 i get a response from my local server. but when i use $.get('/refresh/0, function(){}) i get 404. any ideas?
[16:29:04] <jh1> jrockjiggz: that will work with embed tags but not with objects, they contain the flashvars in a param tag
[16:29:38] <jh1> when i try object:has(param) it works. with object:has(param[flashvars*="vimeo"]) not
[16:30:03] <ravenzz> how do you do that?
[16:30:37] <coldhead> jh1: i would use ?filter // and give it a function which gets very specific and readable about what it's looking for
[16:30:38] <bot-t> jh1, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[16:30:44] <ravenzz> object.has('param[flashvars*="vimeo"]')
[16:31:03] <ravenzz> object:has(param[flashvars*="vimeo"]) won't work
[16:31:28] <jh1> $('object:has(param[flashvars*="vimeo"])')
[16:31:34] <jh1> thats what i do
[16:31:49] <Eviltwin> ravenzz just told you that won't work.
[16:32:04] <ravenzz> when?
[16:32:11] <ravenzz> oh lol
[16:32:17] <ravenzz> you are talking with him
[16:32:53] <jh1> filter is not so good for me, because i have more then an object tag inside of the selector
[16:32:56] <ravenzz> beer + crappy english
[16:33:28] <jh1> jack daniels cola + crappy english :D
[16:33:42] <Eviltwin> maker's mark + normal english
[16:33:53] * ravenzz italian, beer + crappy english
[16:33:57] * ravenzz won
[16:34:06] <coldhead> jh1: that's why you should use filter: $('object').filter(function () { ...
[16:34:19] <coldhead> then you can move all the tricky selector stuff into the function
[16:34:28] <ravenzz> or find
[16:34:30] <ravenzz> :o?=!?
[16:34:36] <coldhead> and at the end of the process you'll have selected just the objects you care about
[16:34:45] <ravenzz> so you can use end() thereafter
[16:34:59] <abnormalex> how do i tell this function which data to grab
[16:35:00] <abnormalex> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[16:35:09] <abnormalex> right now its getting an entire page with html markup
[16:35:17] <Eviltwin> abnormalex: That's how it works...
[16:35:29] <abnormalex> i just want my json_encode array
[16:35:42] <Eviltwin> Then either return only a json_encode array at that URL
[16:35:52] <Eviltwin> Or figure out how to parse it out of the response
[16:36:07] <jh1> but whats wrong with $('object:has(param[flashvars*="vimeo"])')
[16:36:09] <jh1> ?

[16:45:38] <sammmy> If I .each through an set of elements and bind click event handlers to elements within that .each callback, would it be better to use a non-anonymous function for the handler, instead of creating a new anonymous function for every element?
[16:46:30] <Eviltwin> sammmy: The cost of the anonymous function vs. named function is marginal in that case
[16:46:55] <sammmy> Eviltwin: marginal?
[16:47:44] <Eviltwin> If I showed you two sites that were identical except one used an anonymous function and one used a named function for that situation, you would be unable to tell the difference without looking at the source
[16:54:48] <hobbeswalsh> Hi there... I'm pretty new to Jquery, so bear with me. I'm performing an HTTP POST and then attaching a callback to the function ... is there some way I can pass additional parameters to this callback function?
[16:55:18] <hobbeswalsh> the typical behavior is that it just gets whatever was returned by the POST command, but I need some more data to be accessible to it, and I don't think I should be making it global.
[16:56:19] <Eviltwin> You can do something like this: function myFunc(additionalData) { $.post("/my/url", { my: "data" }, function(data) { console.log(data, additionalData); }); }
[16:56:51] <Eviltwin> If you call myFunc({ "yes": "no" }) that will log the data returned from the source as well as the object {"yes": "no"}
[16:57:46] <hobbeswalsh> you're just nesting functions
[16:57:55] <hobbeswalsh> anonymously. right?
[16:58:07] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:58:09] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: $.when( "staticdata", $.ajax({ url: "/my/url", type:"POST" }) ).done( function( staticdata, resultData ) { });
[16:58:30] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Isn't that kind of overkill for what he's trying to do?
[16:59:02] <hobbeswalsh> Eviltwin: that looks more readable to me. why do you say it's overkill?
[16:59:02] <gnarf> Eviltwin: maybe, but its a really easy way to proxy an additional parameter onto an arbitrary promise (jqXHR)
[16:59:41] <gnarf> but what Eviltwin is saying is probably better
[16:59:50] <gnarf> assuming you have this "additional data" in scope
[16:59:51] <Eviltwin> hobbeswalsh: Most of my successes are anonymous functions anyway
[16:59:52] <gnarf> just pass it
[17:00:03] <Eviltwin> Which means that they have the same scope as the $.ajax call
[17:00:14] <Eviltwin> Which means any variables floating around there I have access to
[17:00:45] <gnarf> Eviltwin: whereas all my .ajax() calls are taking place a few layers deep, but they all return promise
[17:00:50] <gnarf> so its really easy to $.when them
[17:00:55] <Eviltwin> So if I was doing something like function lookup(id) { $.get("/resources/"+id, function(resource) { ... }) }
[17:00:57] <hobbeswalsh> gnarf: the data is in scope. but there's already a fair amount of indentation going on...
[17:01:13] <Eviltwin> The ... would have access to "resource" by also whatever id was used to make the lookup
[17:01:19] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: you can use named functions to kill your indent problem too
[17:01:20] <Eviltwin> "id" is in its scope
[17:02:04] <gnarf> either way
[17:02:09] <gnarf> before we argue theoretics
[17:02:28] <gnarf> why don't you put up a gist of some js you're talking about and we can show you
[17:02:35] <Eviltwin> Good idea
[17:03:12] <gnarf> because both of our methods are quite "right" it just kinda depends on the way the data is being handled, what scope your $.ajax is in, etc
[17:04:34] <Eviltwin> For most of my use cases, my solution ends up being simpler because usually the $.ajax call is inside a function call that already has all of the data I want
[17:04:44] <Eviltwin> And the success function is declared as an anonymous function in there
[17:04:50] <Eviltwin> So the data's already in scope
[17:05:18] <Eviltwin> If you're defining the success function outside of the scope of the function that made the $.ajax call, gnarf's idea probably makes more sense
[17:05:22] <hobbeswalsh> https://gist.github.com/2245100
[17:05:24] <Eviltwin> But again, paste / gist / jsfiddle would help
[17:05:40] <hobbeswalsh> Obviouslty that's nit right
[17:05:47] <Eviltwin> hobbeswalsh: What extra data are you trying to pass along?
[17:05:54] <hobbeswalsh> because of the "returns" in the test function
[17:06:16] <hobbeswalsh> /api/1/zones/submit needs "data"
[17:06:27] <hobbeswalsh> but it only needs to run if the test *succeeds*
[17:06:27] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: so like - you see that "only if checkTest passes" part?
[17:06:30] <hobbeswalsh> right
[17:06:39] <gnarf> see ?deferred.pipe
[17:06:40] <bot-t> deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[17:07:00] <gnarf> you can use the deferreds in chains and stuff
[17:07:08] <gnarf> they are pretty hot
[17:07:54] <hobbeswalsh> hurm
[17:08:17] <gnarf> its a pretty complex topic at first
[17:08:24] <gnarf> once you understand em its pretty simple tho
[17:08:36] <hobbeswalsh> looks like I'm just passing the function in pipe()
[17:08:55] <hobbeswalsh> the function needs either arguments or else access to the variables that are in scope, right?
[17:09:42] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: the goal, you want ajaxCall1 to send data to "checkTest" and if that passes, send data to ajaxCall2
[17:09:45] <gnarf> right?
[17:10:06] <hobbeswalsh> that's right
[17:10:39] <abnormalex> can anyone please share tutorial or doc on how i can make this json encode pretty
[17:10:39] <abnormalex> "[{\"pageID\":\"1\",\"pageName\":\"test\"},{\"pageID\":\"2\",\"pageName\":\"test2\"}]"
[17:11:22] <jklmnop> this is probably not the right place to ask, but does anyone know why i might be getting a 403 from typekit? the code is inside of an iframe, but my domain should be recognized by typekit
[17:11:38] <gnarf> ajaxCall1( sendData ).pipe( function( data ) { var dfd = $.Deferred(); if ( checkTest( data ) ) { dfd.resolve( sendData ); } else { dfd.reject(); } return dfd; }).pipe( ajaxCall2 ).done( ... )
[17:11:40] <jklmnop> ps, it WAS working
[17:12:28] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: just as an example of leveraging pipe / deferred
[17:12:46] <gnarf> where function ajaxCall1( data ) { return $.ajax({ .... }); }
[17:12:56] <gnarf> also
[17:13:10] <gnarf> there's nothing stopping you from making your "success function" CALL checkTest
[17:13:18] <gnarf> with an additional param
[17:13:34] <hobbeswalsh> right. except it needs some to pass some data along
[17:13:41] <hobbeswalsh> and I'm not sure how to make that data available
[17:14:05] <hobbeswalsh> am I reading this right: $.post("api/1/zones/test", data, checkTest, 'json')
[17:14:32] <hobbeswalsh> means "send a post to /api/1/zones/test", POST data, and call checkTest with the resultant JSON
[17:14:36] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: personally - I HATE $.post/$.get -- I always use $.ajax
[17:14:36] <hobbeswalsh> ..."
[17:14:43] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: but yes
[17:15:29] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: that $.post line is - $.ajax({ type: "post", url: "api/1/zones/test", data: data, dataType: "json" }).done( checkTest )
[17:16:21] <abnormalex> please help, im having trouble displaying this in any readable format
[17:16:21] <abnormalex> "[{\"pageID\":\"1\",\"pageName\":\"test\"},{\"pageID\":\"2\",\"pageName\":\"test2\"}]"
[17:16:36] <hobbeswalsh> I think you mean .done( createCM ); ..
[17:16:37] <hobbeswalsh> right?
[17:16:56] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: $.post("api/1/zones/test", data, checkTest, 'json') <-- checkTest
[17:17:25] <hobbeswalsh> ah sorry, the callback isn't in the parens
[17:17:52] <hobbeswalsh> and... is there any way to pass additional data to checkTest in that .ajax() example you just wrote?
[17:18:13] <bartmax> $.ajax(function() {data: 'some data'});
[17:18:25] <gnarf> hobbeswalsh: yeah, use a closure to make the .done( function( recv ) { checkTest( data, recv ) })
[17:18:34] <gnarf> or something similar
[17:20:50] <abnormalex> ok i have var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[17:20:57] <abnormalex> how do i display that nicely?
[17:21:10] <gnarf> abnormalex: console.log ?
[17:21:39] <abnormalex> gnarf: [{"pageID":"1","pageName":"test"},{"pageID":"2","pageName":"test2"}]
[17:21:58] <gnarf> abnormalex: thats readable --- its an array with two objects in it
[17:22:24] <abnormalex> oh...
[17:22:39] <abnormalex> obj[0]['pageID'] is undefined
[17:23:00] <abnormalex> hmm the : confuse me
[17:23:04] <gnarf> sounds like its a string? are you double encoding the json?
[17:23:23] <gnarf> i mean, most console.log will give you a "browser" when its an object
[17:23:35] <gnarf> are you doing like a json_encode(json_encode($data))
[17:23:42] <abnormalex> no , is that good to do?
[17:23:47] <gnarf> not at all
[17:23:50] <gnarf> my thought was
[17:23:53] <abnormalex> does it appear double encoded?
[17:23:54] <LeoSh> on a jqueryui slider, it looks like the 'create' event fires before the value of the slider is set - am I missing something or is there no event that fires after the initialization is complete?
[17:24:10] <abnormalex> lol
[17:24:28] <abnormalex> i was totally double encoding it... during return and echo
[17:24:30] <gnarf> abnormalex: i don't know --- is the value you console.logged a string? or an array?  i mean - does your debugger show it as plain text, or as like a browsable array/objects?
[17:25:05] <SVetter> hi everyone
[17:26:17] <abnormalex> thanks gnarf
[17:26:51] <SVetter> I have a question: if I use $.ajax to submit a form (POST), and after submitting it, I want to display the variables in a div using $('nameOfDiv').html("...");
[17:27:00] <SVetter> the thing is, that these variables now are PHP
[17:27:12] <SVetter> is there a different command for that?
[17:27:23] <shoky> LeoSh, isn't initialization complete after calling .slider() ?
[17:27:43] <SVetter> since if I put it in the brackets, the output is the actual characters '$variableName'
[17:28:41] <shoky> what do you mean, they are now PHP
[17:28:47] <SVetter> erm
[17:28:55] <SVetter> well that was expressed weird
[17:28:56] <SVetter> sorry
[17:29:03] <gnarf> SVetter: I gotta say, your description of the problem has some problems
[17:29:04] <gnarf> :)
[17:29:10] <SVetter> :)
[17:29:14] <SVetter> I'm pretty new to this
[17:29:16] <SVetter> sorry
[17:29:27] <gnarf> no problem, its coldhead's first day too
[17:29:28] <SVetter> the thing is, that the variables have been submitted via the POST form
[17:29:42] <gnarf> right
[17:29:56] <LeoSh> shoky: I don't have access to the code that creates it - I just need to know when it's ready so I can attach my own handlers to it
[17:30:00] <SVetter> and I don't know how to display them in the div using the $('div').html("..."); command
[17:30:34] <gnarf> SVetter: the callback of the ajax request will receive a RESPONSE from the php
[17:30:42] <LeoSh> shoky: if I attach on 'create', it's too soon, I get an immediate change event for the initial set of the value
[17:30:44] <gnarf> that response can pass data back to the javascript
[17:30:50] <SVetter> uuuh
[17:30:54] <SVetter> that sounds great :D
[17:31:17] <gnarf> SVetter: so like - you want to respond with some HTML right?
[17:31:35] <shoky> LeoSh, not sure i understand.. it's too soon for what?
[17:31:42] <gnarf> $.post("url", data, function( response ) { $("div").html( response ); } );
[17:31:50] <shoky> so what if you get an immediate change event
[17:32:14] <SVetter> looks great
[17:32:18] <LeoSh> shoky: I don't want to catch the initial set of the slider - only changes from the initial one
[17:32:24] <gnarf> SVetter: although $.ajax({type: "POST", url: "url", data: data }).done( fn )
[17:32:32] <gnarf> i like that signature way more than $.post
[17:32:32] <shoky> treat the first one as the initial one then
[17:32:37] <gnarf> so use whichever
[17:32:57] <SVetter> if I use the second one
[17:33:01] <jh1> when i use .wrap() on an object or embed tag it reloads. Do anybody know a way to wrap them without forceing them to reload?
[17:33:10] <SVetter> where is the response displayed?
[17:33:23] <SVetter> since you used the .html command in the first one
[17:33:29] <SVetter> where is that in the second?
[17:33:44] <shoky> in fn
[17:33:47] <gnarf> SVetter: the function( response ) {...} part was "fn" in the second one
[17:33:54] <gnarf> i just didn't feel like typing all that out again
[17:33:54] <SVetter> oh
[17:33:55] <SVetter> okay
[17:34:03] <SVetter> hmmmm
[17:34:08] <SVetter> thanks :)
[17:34:19] <SVetter> Guess I have a LOT more reading to do ^^
[17:34:26] <asidjazz> start w/ the BIBLE
[17:34:37] <shoky> oh my childhood memories. they are all PHP now
[17:34:45] <SVetter> :D
[17:35:01] <gnarf> shoky: PHP feels so much like last decades problem to me anymore
[17:35:19] <shoky> luckily i only ever had to write about 20 lines of php
[17:35:22] <SVetter> what is this decades one for you then?
[17:35:39] <gnarf> i still get forced into maintaining a few apps, but anymore everything new I'm writing is in JavaScript
[17:36:02] <jh1> no ideas for my wrapping problem?
[17:36:19] <shoky> boo embed tags
[17:36:37] <SVetter> reading job offers here and there, I see Ruby everywhere
[17:36:41] <gnarf> jh1: nope.... no ideas -- i imagine that "reload" happens whenever you append the object to a new place too
[17:36:41] <asidjazz> shoky: whats wrong w/ php?
[17:36:49] <shoky> i wouldn't know
[17:36:52] <gnarf> omg php is horrid
[17:36:55] <asidjazz> horrid?
[17:36:56] <asidjazz> how come?
[17:37:01] <shoky> i was just paraphrasing SVetter
[17:37:06] <gnarf> inconsitent api all over the place
[17:37:12] <asidjazz> what api
[17:37:15] <shoky> ha.
[17:37:19] <jh1> gnarf: maybe with css :before and :after … hm i think i'll give that a try
[17:37:21] <asidjazz> its a language
[17:37:30] <asidjazz> w/ functions
[17:37:30] <shoky> hardly
[17:37:46] <asidjazz> its the most complete and supported language on the web
[17:38:08] <shoky> is it
[17:38:13] <asidjazz> it is
[17:38:18] <shoky> ic
[17:38:23] <gnarf> perhaps - but without looking at the documentation, can you tell me what order the arguments go for str_replace, or is it strreplace, or is it....
[17:38:27] <jh1> php is a good template engine, no more or less
[17:38:43] <gnarf> don't take me wrong, i used the hell out of php
[17:38:44] <asidjazz> search, replace subject
[17:38:45] <asidjazz> like C
[17:38:51] <gnarf> asidjazz: for that function
[17:38:52] <asidjazz> most all functions are wrappers and context of C
[17:38:58] <asidjazz> gnarf: sarch, replace, subject
[17:39:00] <gnarf> asidjazz: some of them are backwards
[17:39:06] <gnarf> asidjazz: some of them arent
[17:39:07] <asidjazz> jh1: thats the main reason for server-side web languages
[17:39:37] <asidjazz> i usually remember and/or guess but hitting phpp.net/function is seconds
[17:39:38] <gnarf> how about strstr.... needle, haystack ? or haystack, needle?
[17:39:39] <jh1> whatever its ugly as hell
[17:39:51] <asidjazz> i think haystack 1st
[17:39:57] <gnarf> asidjazz: think?
[17:40:00] <asidjazz> how is it ugly
[17:40:00] <shoky> of course haystack
[17:40:08] <SVetter> what would be an alternative to PHP?
[17:40:14] <asidjazz> its just functions and variables
[17:40:20] <asidjazz> ruby is under it w/ python
[17:40:23] <jh1> ruby, python
[17:40:25] <asidjazz> but see if you wanna support something
[17:40:26] <asidjazz> anything
[17:40:30] <asidjazz> your bet is php
[17:40:35] <shoky> perl plz.
[17:40:37] <asidjazz> wether its a library or whatever
[17:40:44] <asidjazz> php's your best bet
[17:40:48] <gnarf> anymore, i'm using a lot more nodejs
[17:40:51] <asidjazz> lets say you want to look at stability issues, its php
[17:41:08] <shoky> that doesn't sound promising
[17:41:09] <asidjazz> lets say you want to bring in more devs, better chances you find php devs
[17:41:10] <haizum> anyone else think firefox sucks and is choppy?
[17:41:12] <asidjazz> node.js is in beta form
[17:41:24] <asidjazz> its at 0.6.14
[17:41:32] <gnarf> asidjazz: and?
[17:41:32] <shoky> as if i'd want to hire a 'php dev'
[17:41:33] <asidjazz> its great i love it but if you want to go live
[17:41:35] <asidjazz> GLWT
[17:41:57] <asidjazz> dont get me wrong im a fan of syntactic sugar
[17:42:03] <asidjazz> and sweet functionality
[17:42:08] <asidjazz> and psuedomagiccode
[17:42:15] <asidjazz> but when it comes down to sleeping at night
[17:42:19] <haizum> i'm a long time chrome user and tried switching to firefox recently with my new laptop and have been noticing my webpage animations are all choppy on firefox, whereas they were totally smooth with chrome
[17:42:22] <asidjazz> and saying it supports it
[17:42:29] <asidjazz> im glad php exists
[17:42:45] <gnarf> asidjazz: i still use a lot of php, like i said, I've always hated it though
[17:42:54] <jh1> me too
[17:42:59] <asidjazz> its improving
[17:43:01] <coldhead> CAN WE STOP BANGING ON ABOUT PHP JESUS CHRIST
[17:43:02] <asidjazz> 5.4 has alot
[17:43:13] <gnarf> its an ugly language, which only recently has gained some of the features i wanted it to have 10 years ago
[17:43:43] <asidjazz> a language this large w/ a record of stability that it wants to keep will take that long gnarf
[17:43:53] <Pedobear> Ohai o/
[17:43:58] <asidjazz> also w/ such a large community you got part of it not wanting some of it
[17:44:23] <Asone> Need a stupid confirmation, in any case && and || can't be used in a selector
[17:44:25] <Asone> or am i wrong ?
[17:44:31] <shoky> correct
[17:44:39] <asidjazz> basically i agree somewhat w/ the reasons you hate it but dont think its enough to hate an entire language
[17:44:53] <Asone> thanks shoky :)
[17:45:06] <jh1> Asone i would love that feature too. but sadly your right
[17:45:08] <gnarf> asidjazz: its like a love/hate thing ya know - for a long time it was better than all the alternatives
[17:45:13] <coldhead> you're*
[17:45:18] <gnarf> asidjazz: but anymore, i think the alternatives are winning for me
[17:45:21] <jh1> yes
[17:45:33] <shoky> could be 'your' too
[17:45:42] <gnarf> Asone: you don't need && or || in selectors
[17:45:52] <jh1> no you're … hehe
[17:45:56] <shoky> no!
[17:45:57] <gnarf> ".hasClass.andClass,.orClass"
[17:46:53] <gnarf> no u!
[17:47:00] <shoky> ^_^
[17:47:23] <SVetter> hmmm
[17:47:28] <shoky> wat is it
[17:47:34] <SVetter> I don't get this "fn" thing :-(
[17:47:40] <SVetter> what exactly is that?
[17:47:43] <shoky> a function name?
[17:47:50] <gnarf> SVetter: "fn" shorthand for function
[17:48:16] <asidjazz> gnarf: which is winning?
[17:48:40] <gnarf> asidjazz: like i said, more and more of my active development is nodejs
[17:49:04] <shoky> gnarf, .done() works on the .ajax() because the deferred obj is .resolve()'d on success ?
[17:49:37] <gnarf> shoky: success is done, error is fail, complete is always
[17:49:45] <SVetter> so if I get the response
[17:49:48] <SVetter> errr
[17:49:52] <gnarf> done/fail/always are promise methods
[17:50:02] <SVetter> how do I access the variables from the form?
[17:50:10] <shoky> but jquery is .resolve()ing it on success, for example?
[17:50:11] <SVetter> same names as in the form?
[17:50:39] <SVetter> probably just too tired -.-
[17:50:51] <gnarf> shoky: yes and no, the actual implementation is resolve() on the response, and call success from the .done()
[17:51:11] <gnarf> SVetter: the original data you submitted?
[17:51:15] <SVetter> yes
[17:51:15] <shoky> success()?
[17:51:32] <gnarf> SVetter: the same way you accessed it when you sent it....
[17:51:50] <gnarf> SVetter: i mean, you had to put data: someData somewhere in the $.ajax call
[17:51:56] <gnarf> someData is still around in your scope
[17:51:58] <gnarf> use it
[17:52:06] <shoky> ?success
[17:52:07] <bot-t> shoky, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:52:29] <gnarf> shoky: jqXHR.success === jqXHR.done
[17:52:32] <SVetter> welllll
[17:52:36] <shoky> o
[17:52:45] <SVetter> I sent a variable 'url'
[17:52:56] <SVetter> but this variable is being processed
[17:53:11] <gnarf> SVetter: see ?paste
[17:53:11] <bot-t> SVetter, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:53:16] <shoky> so you're not after the original data afterall?
[17:53:24] <SVetter> no
[17:53:25] <SVetter> :)
[17:53:31] <shoky> make up yer mind boyy
[17:53:38] <SVetter> sorry if I didn't say that
[17:53:46] <shoky> you said the contrary
[17:53:54] <SVetter> :(
[17:53:56] <gnarf> shoky: also, the {success: fn} option is actually being converted to jqXHR.done( fn ) in the $.ajax code
[17:54:26] <shoky> gotcha
[17:54:34] <gnarf> SVetter: if you want to pass some amount of "processed" information back from the serverside php stuff, you can use a JSON response to send an object from PHP to javascript
[17:55:06] <SVetter> yes, that sounds like what I need
[17:55:09] <gnarf> so like <? echo json_encode(array("newData" => $newData, "andThis" => $andThis));
[17:55:32] <shoky> >
[17:55:33] <shoky> smth.
[17:56:01] <gnarf> and then $.ajax({ url: "/url", type: "POST", data: {passedIn: someData}, dataType: "json" }).done( function( response ) { console.log( response.newData, response.andThis ); });
[17:56:45] <SVetter> wow
[17:57:00] <SVetter> ok
[17:57:02] <gnarf> SVetter: just be careful a) not to double encode things - it gets crazy... b) only send one json object in response
[17:57:28] <gnarf> you cant echo json_encode( $newData ) . json_encode( $andThis ) to send two things, send back an object
[17:57:38] <SVetter> ok
[17:57:51] <SVetter> thank you!
[17:58:36] <SVetter> so thats what json is for
[17:58:43] <SVetter> (amongst other things I guess :D)
[17:58:52] <SVetter> read it a lot
[17:58:55] <SVetter> but never looked into it
[18:02:40] <SVetter> why did you use "passedIn" ?
[18:04:06] <shoky> it's the data he's passing in
[18:04:16] <shoky> or.. posting
[18:05:41] <shoky> so.. pretty bored here
[18:06:01] <SVetter> are you guys 'professionals' btw?
[18:06:10] <SVetter> as in working as programmers?
[18:06:18] <shoky> aye
[18:06:24] <SVetter> cool
[18:06:28] <SVetter> what are you doing exactly?
[18:07:01] <shoky> mm mostly server-side code. java and c/c++ mostly
[18:07:24] <shoky> but now doing some web stuff too
[18:07:31] <SVetter> freelancing?
[18:07:37] <shoky> nope
[18:08:14] <shoky> been at the same place for 9 years :S
[18:09:17] <shoky> and u?!?!
[18:10:12] <shoky> fine. i'll go shave
[18:12:12] <gnarf> SVetter: I have a few part-time/contract gigs and the jQuery team
[18:12:43] <SVetter> sorry shoky
[18:12:50] <SVetter> was reading up :)
[18:12:57] <SVetter> I just finished with university
[18:13:10] <SVetter> sadly, I didn't study any computer sciences
[18:13:21] <SVetter> engineering and business
[18:13:26] <SVetter> so now I'm catching up
[18:13:51] <SVetter> there's just nothing you can do properly without at least SOME basics anymore
[18:14:41] <SVetter> Just started looking into PHP/MySQL 5 months ago
[18:14:53] <SVetter> and now I'm adding some JavaScript/jQuery stuff
[18:15:12] <SVetter> didn't think I would pick something that needs all this Ajax/json stuff too
[18:15:14] <SVetter> :D
[18:15:20] <SVetter> but hey
[18:15:26] <SVetter> it's fun to learn
[18:17:11] <chovy> hi
[18:17:39] <chovy> i have a list of <li>'s absolutely position two form a circle. What's the easiest way to animate them 90 degrees on their axis?
[18:17:57] <chovy> so the one at the top of the circle ends up on the left.
[18:20:14] <gnarf> chovy: its not going to be easy
[18:20:47] <gnarf> chovy: you're going to need to do some custom .animate({}) calls with your own "easing" functions
[18:20:56] <gnarf> to approximate an arc
[18:22:05] <Asone> need rotation of coordinates ?
[18:22:21] <deanclkclk> guys...I'm having a funny problem
[18:22:52] <deanclkclk> $("#table").find("tr").each(function (){}) throws error...
[18:23:02] <deanclkclk> anyone has any idea why?
[18:24:17] <deanclkclk> error is table: [Exception: ReferenceError: table is not defined]
[18:24:27] <deanclkclk> I don't understand
[18:24:37] <Zzaichik> Is there a table with the ID of table?
[18:24:52] <deanclkclk> yeah it is
[18:25:02] <deanclkclk> let me pastie my exact code
[18:25:07] <Zzaichik> jsfiddle.com
[18:25:10] <Zzaichik> use that ^
[18:25:26] <deanclkclk> http://www.pastie.org/3695414
[18:25:29] <deanclkclk> ok
[18:27:00] <Asone> chovy
[18:27:07] <Asone> you might want to check this :
[18:27:08] <Asone> enctype="multipart/form-data"
[18:27:13] <Asone> damn
[18:27:15] <Asone> this was not
[18:27:23] <Asone> http://weepy.github.com/jquery.path/
[18:29:52] <SVetter> damn
[18:30:12] <SVetter> if I post my code in jsFiddle, can you guys have a quick look?
[18:30:21] <SVetter> I doesn't seem to be a total desaster
[18:30:24] <shoky> yes
[18:30:27] <SVetter> but still doesn't work right
[18:30:28] <SVetter> cool
[18:31:04] <deanclkclk> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/dZZYJ/
[18:31:08] <shoky> nothing much to know about json ;p
[18:32:04] <deanclkclk> sorry updated version http://jsfiddle.net/dZZYJ/1/
[18:34:03] <jh1> can i make this "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fapi%2Ftimedtext%3Fsparams%3Dasr_langs" to a real url?
[18:35:38] <SVetter> okay
[18:35:39] <SVetter> http://jsfiddle.net/XAXb7/
[18:35:41] <SVetter> here it is
[18:35:50] <shoky> jh1, decodeURIComponent( "..." )
[18:35:57] <SVetter> in addition to this
[18:36:10] <SVetter> I have the PHP file that processes the entered url from the form
[18:36:41] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: so how are you getting an error with that?
[18:36:58] <SVetter> but the only important part in there is $parse_array = array("variable1" => $variable1 ... );
[18:36:59] <SVetter> json_encode($parse_array);
[18:37:32] <deanclkclk> ahh sorry Zzaichik here it is working
[18:37:33] <deanclkclk> http://jsfiddle.net/dZZYJ/4/
[18:37:44] <deanclkclk> the entire table has disappeared
[18:37:59] <deanclkclk> it not even went into the .each function
[18:38:03] <shoky> SVetter and what's the prob?
[18:38:16] <deanclkclk> that's teh problem I am getting
[18:38:31] <SVetter> I don't know
[18:38:35] <SVetter> I don't get an error
[18:38:40] <SVetter> just nothing :(
[18:38:50] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: okay hang on a sec man.
[18:38:52] <shoky> what is supposed to happen that isn't happening
[18:39:12] <shoky> 'i dont know' doesnt help much
[18:39:23] <SVetter> well I want to pass the url from the form to the file meta-parse.php
[18:39:31] <SVetter> that seems to work so far
[18:39:45] <SVetter> there, the meta tags from the entered url are parsed
[18:39:51] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: http://jsfiddle.net/dZZYJ/5/
[18:39:56] <SVetter> and stored in $parse_array
[18:40:10] <SVetter> that array is json_encode(d)
[18:40:36] <shoky> uhm
[18:40:37] <shoky>  var json = $.parseJSON(data);
[18:40:47] <shoky> what is data?
[18:41:09] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: afk for a minute
[18:41:17] <shoky> SVetter i think you need: success: function(data) {
[18:41:21] <deanclkclk> Zzaichik: nothing doesn't happen with your code..it should remove the ".invisible" from the tr
[18:41:29] <deanclkclk> nohting doesn't happen with that code Zzaichik
[18:41:33] <deanclkclk> sorry
[18:41:49] <Zzaichik> Yeah I know. hang on just a sec.
[18:41:54] <Zzaichik> afk for a minute
[18:42:05] <deanclkclk> ok sorry
[18:42:43] <gnarf> SVetter: yeah, "data" needs to be a parameter for the "success function"
[18:42:43] <SVetter> data is supposed to be the array that comes back from the meta-parse.php in case of .success
[18:42:48] <SVetter> ok
[18:42:52] <gnarf> function(data) {
[18:43:00] <shoky> yes, it's a parameter to the success callback function
[18:43:00] <gnarf> but like
[18:43:10] <gnarf> if you use dataType: "json" in the ajax options
[18:43:15] <shoky> yes.
[18:43:15] <gnarf> you don't even need to parseJSON it
[18:43:28] <gnarf> so it could be function( json )
[18:43:52] <SVetter> oh
[18:43:53] <SVetter> okay
[18:44:14] <SVetter> so the encoded array is automatically called json?
[18:46:12] <SVetter> ugh
[18:46:14] <SVetter> :/
[18:46:19] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: okay I'm back. So are you just trying to get that table to disappear / reappear?
[18:46:27] <SVetter> still nothing :(
[18:46:34] <SVetter> not even an error
[18:48:17] <SVetter> okay
[18:48:31] <SVetter> I removed the var json = $.parseJSON(data); part
[18:49:47] <SVetter> arrrrrrr
[18:51:59] <jh2> ah nice i can make | for or in selectors with http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[18:52:19] <SVetter> so, if I take away the whole json part, it works
[18:52:21] <SVetter> :-/
[18:52:33] <blast_hardcheese> Probably a simple question that gets asked a lot, but is there a way to get the return value of $.post's success callback?
[18:53:35] <Zzaichik> oh,  deanclkclk:
[18:53:45] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: http://jsfiddle.net/dZZYJ/6/
[18:53:53] <ntry> Asone: you can make or in selectors with http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[18:54:09] <Zzaichik> Even though I don't fully understand what you're trying to do yet
[18:57:00] <SVetter> maybe it is something with the array coming from the parser?
[18:57:43] <SVetter> the json object looks like {"title":".................","description":"........."}
[18:58:12] <SVetter> is it a problem if some values are null?
[18:58:21] <SVetter> or have special characters?
[19:02:35] <deanclkclk> Zzaichik: ohh yeah...I thought it wasn't going into the each function
[19:02:37] <deanclkclk> seems it is
[19:02:40] <deanclkclk> thanks bro
[19:02:57] <Zzaichik> np
[19:03:01] <Zzaichik> was that all you needed?
[19:13:36] <deanclkclk> Zzaichik:  yeah
[19:13:37] <deanclkclk> thanks man
[19:14:21] <Zzaichik> deanclkclk: Okay cool!  Glad I could help.
[19:15:17] <toddWork> for an ajax call, is there a way to capture a 404 error?
[19:16:19] <blast_hardcheese> Disregard my question, I was thinking synchronously
[19:20:46] <shoky> toddWork, you can use the statusCode map
[19:21:14] <toddWork> shoky: i'll check it out. thank you.
[19:23:18] <toddWork> shoky: oh no; its' jsonp.
[19:23:44] <toddWork> i guess it doesn't work.
[19:23:51] <shoky> ah
[19:36:49] <sammmy> Should I use the event.data object for my custom events?
[19:57:14] <ntry> hm i have this regex /id=([0-9a-zA-Z]{11})[^0-9a-zA-Z_-]/ but when i change it to /video_id=([0-9a-zA-Z]{11})[^0-9a-zA-Z_-]/ it's not working anymore. Is it the _ ?
[19:58:29] <ntry> i mean the _ between video and id
[19:58:35] <gnarf> ntry: _ has no special meaning in regular expressions, no
[19:58:43] <ntry> hm
[20:00:40] <ntry> ah found the bug, thanks gnarf

[20:25:30] <Zzaichik> ?example
[20:26:27] <Zzaichik> make it a working (broken) example and then I'll work on it with you
[20:33:13] <olinux> onclick of the bolds i want to swap out with text input that has datepicker ui attached, html is <p id="daterange">Showing data for <b>Mar 23</b> - <b>Mar 29</b></p>

[20:42:20] <aqeel> hi .....zzaichik
[20:42:39] <aqeel> thnanks...for your time....
[20:43:37] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com..................must view in ie6,7,8.............to get the view working on
[20:44:57] <aqeel> Zzaichik...............u there/
[20:45:04] <Zzaichik> yeah
[20:45:10] <Zzaichik> so what are you trying to do?
[20:45:58] <aqeel> give the layout with extra wrapping
[20:46:24] <aqeel> can u see in ie6,7,8......................jailbreak.webege.com
[20:46:37] <aqeel> not emulation...they will not work properly...
[20:47:27] <aqeel> that html line is too long and needs replacement in html....i would simply like to add the spans as wrap()
[20:48:08] <Zzaichik> ah okay. So that .html(…) You want to replace
[20:48:18] <aqeel> yup
[20:48:26] <Zzaichik> No I'm following you.
[20:48:30] <Zzaichik> Now*
[20:49:18] <aqeel> so what will your suggention be
[20:49:26] <aqeel> suggestion*
[20:49:40] <Zzaichik> Okay so, you don't like using the wrap?
[20:49:45] <Zzaichik> Or it's not working in IE
[20:49:56] <aqeel> not working as intented in ie
[20:50:10] <Zzaichik> Alright, what's it doing in IE
[20:50:44] <aqeel> i tired the wrap() it losses it position and becomes inline and image disappears
[20:51:15] <whatthepoop> noob question: using this code in that ugly event listener handler (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/786380/using-youtubes-javascript-api-with-jquery/786420#786420) it only seems to work if the playerState function is defined *outside* of jQuery's $(document).ready().. how would I make it work inside the $(document).ready()?
[20:51:48] <Lonestar99> howdy folks
[20:53:36] <Lonestar99> does the following affect  class "foo" element --> $(".foo").css({color:'#000'})
[20:53:54] <aqeel> yes
[20:54:23] <Lonestar99> ok so ".foo" is class and "#foo" is id right?
[20:54:32] <aqeel> u beginner?
[20:54:34] <aqeel> yes
[20:54:55] <Zzaichik> it's exactly like CSS in that manner
[20:55:35] <aqeel> so Zzaichik what shouls my approach be in that case of wrap()
[20:55:46] <Zzaichik> aqeel:  do you think something like this might work? http://jsfiddle.net/xgbCn/3/
[20:56:18] <Lonestar99> kinda a beginner with jquery, 99% of the time use "id" and not "class"
[20:56:29] <Zzaichik> that's backwards Lonestar99
[20:56:51] <Zzaichik> you should try to use class more often than not.
[20:57:13] <aqeel> thanks implementing now...
[21:00:28] <Lonestar99> Zzaichik:  why is that?
[21:01:09] <Zzaichik> Id's should be used sparingly
[21:02:05] <Zzaichik> they are much more restrictive
[21:03:35] <Zzaichik> Lonestar99:  http://screwlewse.com/2010/07/dont-use-id-selectors-in-css/
[21:04:06] <Lonestar99> Zzaichik: ok will read that thanks
[21:04:22] <Zzaichik> Well, just check out the four things at the top
[21:04:40] <Zzaichik> I mean, you can use them, they're just super restrictive. I guess just use them sparingly.
[21:05:15] <Lonestar99> ok,  will take that into account on my next project
[21:06:44] <Zzaichik> It's a good idea to get into a habit of just using one style, and the only way that will work is to use classes. And then you can save ID's for things that need special attention. The reason to use classes is they can refer to many different elements but they can also be specific to one element. But Id's can only be applied to one element. It's just cleaner, more efficient. But, you can do whatever.
[21:08:16] <Lonestar99> Zzaichik: oh yeah in styling i use class alot, but when building dynamic ajax apps i always use id
[21:14:13] <Lonestar99> the following not working --> $(".ba0").css({color:"#006699"});  --> htm+= '<div><span class="ba0">'+elem.basummary+'</span></div>';  ??
[21:14:35] <Lonestar99> not coloring jack...

[21:15:20] <Lonestar99> where is capital city?

[21:15:45] <Zzaichik> Lonestar99: build that shit in jsfiddle.com man
[21:15:48] <coldhead> everywhere in the world
[21:15:57] <Lonestar99> k
[21:19:20] <Lonestar99> http://jsfiddle.net/XnZ7k/
[21:20:33] <Zzaichik> ah
[21:20:50] <Zzaichik> you were setting the color of an element that doesn't exist when it's being set
[21:21:03] <Zzaichik> put that top line at the bottom and you'll get your desired effect
[21:21:05] <Lonestar99> yeah, that is what i thought
[21:21:22] <Lonestar99> oh ok easy enough
[21:21:24] <Lonestar99> lol
[21:21:26] <Lonestar99> thanks
[21:21:27] <Zzaichik> just need to have that element created before you try to style it.
[21:21:29] <Zzaichik> haha - np
[21:22:21] <Zzaichik> and if you're only going to have one style rule to apply, you can do it like this:
[21:22:22] <Zzaichik> $(".ba0").css('color','#ab1616');
[21:22:49] <Lonestar99> oh ok
[21:24:31] <coldhead> ba0 is a terrible class name
[21:24:44] <Lonestar99> LOL
[21:24:49] <Lonestar99> yeah making it chort
[21:24:53] <Lonestar99> short
[21:24:56] <Zzaichik> haha - yeah it's pretty rough
[21:45:37] <Gates> hmm
[21:45:48] <Gates> i wonder how easy it would be to make an image cropper like fb's
[21:46:09] <coldhead> its easier than you think
[21:46:15] <coldhead> you just download the plugin
[21:46:17] <coldhead> and use that
[21:47:57] <Gates> "the plugin"
[21:48:00] <Gates> and use "that"
[21:48:06] <Gates> i do not follow
[21:49:00] <Gates> ...I was thinking you could do a background image and drag/drop it to readjust its position and it saves the x-y? idk

[21:51:16] <kurol> idunno)
[21:51:17] <gnarf> extra )
[21:51:46] <gnarf> thats what i get for copy&pasting
[21:52:16] * kurol thinks there's a jquery joke in there somewhere
[21:53:34] <kurol> i just found some example code that used jquery 1.3
[21:54:28] <Gates> cool!
[21:54:52] <Gates> any ideas on how to make an image inside a box that can be repositioned and saved
[21:55:40] <kurol> saved? like localStorage?
[21:55:59] <j9058> can someone tell me if i put the variables and function in the right spot in my plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/CjqMv/
[21:56:06] <j9058> functions*
[21:57:32] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[21:57:34] <Gates> like this
[21:57:45] <Gates> but the image cannot be dragged passed teh image's width
[21:58:01] <Gates> maybe using background img isnt the best idea
[21:59:28] <Gates> plus when the mouse goes out of the box it messes up :\
[22:00:34] <Gates> kurol: like that ^
[22:00:59] <kurol> you can sort of save images using the Canvas api
[22:02:26] <kurol> you could possibly fake it by cropping the image client side
[22:02:35] <kurol> using css trickery
[22:03:48] <Gates> it seems that wat fb does for the big image and timeline
[22:03:55] <Gates> its an <img> not background
[22:04:06] <Gates> the full image is there but only peice is visible
[22:04:29] <raj> Cork, why are iframes frowned upon?
[22:06:20] * kurol wanders off to what might possibly be sleep
[22:10:58] <j9058> not sure what proper etiquette is here... but this should be a quick question
[22:11:00] <j9058> are these methods and instance variables in the right spot? http://jsfiddle.net/CjqMv/

[22:14:07] <aqeel> html works but wrap does not?
[22:14:14] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[22:14:22] <aqeel> see under ie6,7,8....only
[22:16:55] <Gates> kurol: cant get it - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[22:19:04] <gnarf> j9058: looking
[22:19:23] <j9058> gnarf: thank you
[22:19:49] <gnarf> j9058: you looking for random style critique?
[22:20:25] <Gates> kurol: it works but not if the window is too small :\
[22:20:26] <j9058> gnarf: well basically
[22:20:34] <gnarf> i really don't see anything that screams out as far as scope issues go
[22:20:46] <gnarf> however
[22:20:53] <gnarf> that whole thing is "lexically bound"
[22:20:54] <j9058> but, the jquery doc functions ( function: function()...
[22:20:58] <j9058> right
[22:21:15] <gnarf> there are few "helpers" that really don't even have any business inside "init"
[22:21:31] <gnarf> function _expandEmpty( el )
[22:22:10] <j9058> yea, i was confused on what should go where.
[22:22:40] <gnarf> j9058: in general, there are only two ways to give a function the data it needs
[22:22:54] <gnarf> 1) pass as argument, 2) put in scope
[22:23:13] <gnarf> so like if it doesn't need the scope, don't put it there
[22:23:17] <Gates> gnarf: any ideas on how to make the draggable image inside a box, with teh ability to save teh position
[22:23:27] <gnarf> Gates: define "save the position"
[22:23:51] <gnarf> j9058: also, this is just something that bugs me after being forced to adhere to it for SO long
[22:24:01] <gnarf> j9058: one var per function()
[22:24:08] <gnarf> j9058: var a,b,c,d,e;
[22:24:28] <j9058> gnarf: so i can move all methods that don't utilize any of those variables outside of init
[22:24:51] <gnarf> j9058: realistically, do any of those functions have anything to do with "initialization"
[22:25:01] <gnarf> if not - they should probably not be inside "init"
[22:25:02] <gnarf> :)
[22:25:04] <j9058> gnarf: no
[22:25:13] <Gates> gnarf: save it as a string anywhere, im not worreid about the saving as much as the x/y being outputted
[22:25:17] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[22:25:38] <j9058> gnarf: should they be methods on the same level as 'init'?
[22:25:49] <aqeel> hey why would wrap() make my image disappear?
[22:26:35] <gnarf> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/sCmJ7/4/
[22:27:03] <gnarf> j9058: 6 of one- half dozen of the other
[22:27:18] <gnarf> i usually try to put things in the SMALLEST scope/indentation level possible
[22:27:36] <Gates> gnarf: how would u limit the image from inside the box from never going into white space
[22:27:59] <Gates> so you cannot pull it down any further than the image is visible
[22:28:00] <Jillescode> Guys, any good jQuery plugins for sublime text2
[22:29:16] <j9058> gnarf: but then those functions can't access the instance variables inside of init.... if i put the variable just inside the main (function($) { closure, then they're not instance specific...
[22:29:32] <gnarf> Gates: look at the demos/docs - i'm not sure off the top of my head
[22:29:55] <gnarf> j9058: you're passing instanced things into it aren't you?
[22:30:35] <j9058> gnarf: no, a lot of the methods just reference those outer variables
[22:30:50] <Gates> gnarf: it should be {containment:"#draggable"}
[22:30:55] <Gates> but that doesnt allow for a smooth drag
[22:30:58] <Gates> and i cannot figure out why
[22:32:55] <gnarf> j9058: hrm
[22:33:11] <gnarf> j9058: well minesweeper is a bit of a different style of data than say a widget would deal with
[22:33:38] <j9058> gnarf: it's just a pile of variables, and methods that act on that pile of variable.
[22:33:51] <gnarf> j9058: right but like its all bound up into that one init()
[22:33:52] <j9058> gnarf: maybe not the best structure in the world, but i'm not sure how else to do it in js
[22:34:01] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[22:34:01] <Gates> see
[22:34:02] <subdesign> hi
[22:34:03] <Gates> :\
[22:34:09] <gnarf> you could separate the responsibility of the methods into smaller chunks
[22:34:15] <j9058> yea
[22:34:25] <gnarf> things could trigger events bound on the container in init that trigger the "overall logic"
[22:34:41] <Gates> im at a lose
[22:34:45] <gnarf> while each "cell" can get decorated with what it needs to know about itself
[22:34:55] <aqeel> any face this problem....wrap() makes my img disappear?
[22:35:02] <gnarf> init is generally a very small method
[22:35:19] <j9058> hm, so i'm not sure what 'bound on the container in init' means
[22:35:51] <gnarf> j9058: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[22:35:59] <gnarf> now mind you - thats widget factory
[22:36:06] <gnarf> and that create method is HUGE
[22:36:10] * gnarf glares at kborchers
[22:36:11] <gnarf> ;)
[22:36:30] <subdesign> question: i want to repopulate my php form after submit, and want to set some fields to enabled state. I get "jquery is not a function" error but same error for plain javascript too
[22:36:52] <gnarf> j9058: your design has you basically all bound up in init()
[22:37:11] <subdesign> any idea why?
[22:37:13] <gnarf> which isn't to say thats a terrible design
[22:37:19] <gnarf> if it works, it works
[22:37:39] <j9058> it works... but it just didn't look right
[22:37:42] <gnarf> but it just feels like there really should be more than just an "init" method on a minesweeper :)
[22:37:45] <j9058> so i came to the gurus
[22:37:51] <j9058> yea
[22:38:05] <gnarf> j9058: remember, you can always use $(this).data("minesweeper", { gamestateinfo.... })
[22:38:13] <gnarf> and let your functions operate on that
[22:38:18] <gnarf> to get at the "instance"
[22:38:47] <j9058> so 'this' is always the element given by the plugin selector, right?
[22:39:00] <j9058> from the methods on the same level as 'init'
[22:39:00] <gnarf> j9058: this is the "context" of a function call
[22:39:04] <gnarf> which is dangerous
[22:39:30] <gnarf> there are few different patterns to take
[22:39:45] <j9058> i felt like the documentation on jquery.com wasn't great for plugins
[22:39:45] <gnarf> one would be to make a function Minesweeper() { // init code }
[22:40:08] <gnarf> minesweeper isn't really a plugin though ;)
[22:40:10] <gnarf> its an app
[22:40:38] <j9058> i guess, but it still seems reasonable to be able to wrap it all in one plugin though, no?
[22:40:48] <gnarf> j9058: sure, why not
[22:41:04] <gnarf> j9058: i still think you want a function Minesweeper()
[22:41:06] <Gates> gnarf: i cannot find anything more than using the containment on the outer wrapper but then it doesnt smoothly move
[22:41:10] <gnarf> and a Minesweeper.prototype.functions
[22:41:27] <subdesign> my code: http://hastebin.com/yofamotodi.coffee
[22:41:38] <gnarf> but there are different schools
[22:41:44] <gnarf> nothing is really "wrong" with either approach
[22:41:51] <gnarf> if it gets the app shipped
[22:41:53] <gnarf> ;)
[22:41:56] <j9058> hm, what's the prototype thing? or what should i google to read about it?
[22:42:14] <gnarf> j9058: $.fn === $.prototype
[22:42:25] <raj> gnarf, what's wrong with using iframes?
[22:42:38] <gnarf> $( selector ) === return (new $()).init( selector);
[22:42:53] <gnarf> that is to say
[22:42:59] <gnarf> $( selector ) instanceof jQuery
[22:43:14] <gnarf> so it has all the methods of jQuery.prototype, or jQuery.fn
[22:44:05] <j9058> oh, right
[22:44:27] <gnarf> so the ui widget factory kinda does this under the hood
[22:44:27] <coldhead> i miss pleck
[22:44:34] <gnarf> when you call $().draggable() for instance
[22:44:50] <gnarf> it checks for this.data("draggable")
[22:44:55] <j9058> gnarf: so that example plugin you sent me: instead of creating a ton of instance vars. it seems to assign fields on this (ex this.timer = ) instead
[22:45:01] <gnarf> which is an "instance" of draggable
[22:45:12] <gnarf> j9058: yup
[22:45:45] <gnarf> in UI - we store the "instance" of the widget (that has all the prototyped methods) in this.data( widgetName )
[22:46:01] <j9058> gnarf: ok, i'll try that. and it seems the convention is to _private methods.  even though all of those methods are exposed as public
[22:46:26] <gnarf> j9058: so in UI - we keep some of those around as hook points
[22:46:44] <gnarf> j9058: where the average user wont need to do anything with any of the _ methods
[22:46:48] <j9058> why? wouldn't you just use this.whatever ?
[22:47:18] <gnarf> well semantically in UI  the "bridge" or the thing responsible for .draggable("stop") will not let you call .draggable("_private")
[22:47:21] <j9058> why would you need to store it in data() if you have 'this'?
[22:47:59] <gnarf> j9058: how does the second call to $( selector ).draggable() know to operate on the instance already running instead of starting a new one
[22:48:10] <gnarf> jQuery's .data() is per-element
[22:48:23] <j9058> gnarf: draggable?
[22:48:23] <Gates> gnarf: good new! It does work! can you help with one small issue => http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[22:48:42] <gnarf> j9058: random example
[22:48:45] <Gates> gnarf: when you drag out of the box everything f up :\
[22:49:31] <j9058> gnarf: oh, "draggable' being the plugin name?
[22:49:34] <gnarf> j9058: yeah
[22:49:58] <gnarf> j9058: you know jQuery( "body" ) !== jQuery( "body" ) right?
[22:50:18] <gnarf> although they contain the same element (document.body) they are not the same instance of jQuery
[22:50:24] <j9058> right
[22:50:32] <gnarf> so jQuery has .data to store data for that specific element
[22:50:43] <gnarf> so the "bridge" keeps the instance in .data()
[22:50:48] <Makiren> how do i reverse the order this is outputting in? http://jsfiddle.net/anphonic/FpeUv/
[22:50:51] <gnarf> and passes method calls into that instance
[22:51:05] <j9058> that leads me to believe you only need one object stored in data() at each element then
[22:51:13] <j9058> just the instance of the plugin
[22:51:15] <gnarf> exactly
[22:51:19] <j9058> ok
[22:51:24] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.timepicker.js
[22:51:35] <gnarf> here btw is an example of why the _ methods are actually "public"
[22:51:36] <subdesign> please answer : If I repopulate a form could I set some input fields disabled property or class with js/jq ?
[22:51:51] <gnarf> j9058: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.timepicker.js#L60-74 for specific
[22:52:16] <gnarf> notice here that i've created a spinner, and then I am overriding the spinners _parse, _value and _adjustValue methods
[22:52:50] <j9058> ah, ok
[22:52:58] <gnarf> j9058: http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[22:53:04] <gnarf> thats what the plugin acutally does
[22:53:15] <gnarf> it takes a "mask" and a "spinner" and wires them together
[22:53:23] <Gates> gnarf: how do i make the vars update on stop as well as before the function?
[22:53:23] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[22:53:37] <j9058> i'm going to try and apply some of this real quick
[22:54:13] <gnarf> j9058: eh - don't be quick - think it through first :)
[22:54:24] <gnarf> its a bit of a restructure from what you have
[22:54:37] <Gates> gnarf: i assume u throw it into a function but clearly i am incapiable
[22:54:51] <gnarf> j9058: see ?proxy
[22:54:51] <bot-t> j9058, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[22:54:59] <gnarf> j9058: that function will be VERY useful for event handlers
[22:55:00] <gnarf> :)
[22:55:49] <gnarf> i.e. this.element.on("click", ".cell", jQuery.proxy( cellClicked, this ) )
[22:55:57] <j9058> gnarf: hmmm. seems powerful. i'll have to ponder that for a few minutes to see exactly how to use it
[22:56:01] <gnarf> i.e. this.element.on("click", ".cell", jQuery.proxy( this, "_cellClicked" ) )
[22:56:21] <Gates> :\
[22:56:35] <gnarf> Gates: and sorry, im torn in too many directions right now...
[22:56:48] <gnarf> can't really dive into that level of implementation at the moment
[22:56:50] <Gates> ts okay i figured it was a quick fix
[22:56:58] <Gates> i fixed most issues
[22:57:14] <Gates> just not sure how to wrap a function that happens at first and on stop
[22:57:37] <j9058> gnarf: thanks a ton btw
[22:58:09] <gnarf> j9058: no problem - lets just say the content of the demo made it worth answering the theoretical question you posed ;)
[22:58:23] <Makiren> ooOOoooOoOO?
[22:58:40] <j9058> gnarf: i'm glad
[23:04:33] <Gates> gnarf: can u look at this quick

[23:09:15] <_gates> :o
[23:10:41] <Makiren>  yup, im too tired and preoccupied to be doing this
[23:11:00] <Gates> lol
[23:11:17] <Makiren> why was it outputting in the reverse order?
[23:11:29] <Makiren> i used prependTo not appendTo
[23:11:45] <Makiren> then wasted 30 minutes of bleary eyed searching
[23:11:49] <ngharo> Gates: you want to update 'containment' on stop?
[23:12:58] <Gates> Makiren: use appendTo
[23:13:09] <Gates> ngharo: yes and on start
[23:13:23] <ngharo> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/sCmJ7/9/ this?
[23:13:31] <Gates> ngharo: the goal is to make it draggable and be able to be saved and displayed else where in the same position
[23:13:58] <Makiren> Gates: yeah I changed it lmao after wasting 30 minutes
[23:14:00] <Gates> nope, i cannot drag towards the bottom
[23:14:55] <Gates> Makiren: in this (updated) setup - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[23:15:03] <Gates> see how teh image can never leave the box
[23:15:05] <ngharo> look at the console, i think you have everything you need there in the ui object, no need to calc yourself
[23:15:07] <Gates> in your v9 it breaks
[23:15:18] <Gates> hmm
[23:15:33] <ngharo> Gates: yes, i see that.  I simply did what you asked
[23:16:16] <Gates> ngharo: yes well i am wrong :]
[23:18:12] <j9058> gnarf: this 'methods' closure in the documentation is confusing me i think http://jsfiddle.net/YHns6/
[23:20:10] <gnarf> j9058: methods isn't a closure
[23:20:18] <gnarf> closure is a clever word for a function
[23:20:29] <j9058> object i mean
[23:21:52] <Gates> its just console.log(ui.position.top, ui.position.left); with a css top/left :]
[23:21:58] <gnarf> j9058: perhaps === that entry point is whats confusing
[23:22:11] <gnarf> j9058: the $.fn.minesweeper
[23:23:51] <Whirl3d> Good evenin' all. Does anybody have a good reference for a tutorial that goes through how to make a slideshow or gallery plugin. I have found a couple of examples--but they were so convoluted and had such ridiculous precursor requirements, that they were pretty useless.
[23:24:30] <gnarf> j9058: good, you survived the split
[23:24:46] <Whirl3d> Even if someone could just point me to a well-formed, nicely implemented simple slide show plugin that I could pick apart to learn, that would be great.
[23:24:50] <j9058> gnarf: ?
[23:26:02] <gnarf> if you want to attack this from a "Minesweeper object" approach
[23:26:21] <gnarf> you want to have you .fn.minesweeper look for that minesweeper object in data, and use it instead of methods
[23:27:00] <gnarf> otherwise, it needs to create a new Minesweeper( this, options ) for each element in "this" (in the context of $.fn)
[23:31:27] <gnarf> so you could say spawn up three minesweepers with the same options by doing $(".someclass").minesweeper()
[23:33:26] <j9058> right, that already work in my first example
[23:33:44] <j9058> i guess it's as though my 'methods' object is really my minesweeper class
[23:43:25] <coldhead> skrillex is for girls
[23:44:18] <j9058> gnarf: this is right from the documentation. why doesn't it do anything? http://jsfiddle.net/YHns6/1/
[23:44:34] <gnarf> j9058: it wasn't really a "class" it was a single object
[23:45:32] <gnarf> j9058: i might be out on a leaf here - but you might wanna use jQuery instead of moo :)
[23:46:30] <coldhead> i wonder how many wasted hours would be saved if jQuery was the default on jsfiddle
[23:46:33] <j9058> gnarf: blah, well still
[23:47:32] <gnarf> j9058: as much as i'd like to spend more time trying to debug, im just not into debug mode right now - im in theoretical think mode :)
[23:47:46] <gnarf> aka - tired as hell and i really don't wanna "write" anything :)
[23:47:48] <j9058> gnarf: hah, ok. np
[23:49:22] <coldhead> let's all take a break
[23:50:16] <Trisox> coldhead: coldhead
[23:51:11] <Trisox> coldhead: i say 3 hours a week
[23:51:49] <coldhead> it's worth doing
[23:52:01] <Trisox> yea snipit lib ;)
[23:52:28] <coldhead> SOME THINGS ARE IRREPLACEABLE SOME THINGS ARE BETTER OFF NOT LOST
[23:52:48] <Trisox> something like that :D
[23:52:55] <Trisox> how you been ?
[23:53:27] <Gates> gnarf: yay it works :] http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/sCmJ7/
[23:54:34] <coldhead> barely hanging on, Trisox
[23:54:41] <coldhead> barely hanging on
[23:54:42] <coldhead> you?

[23:56:24] <coldhead> BUT AT LEAST it's friday for me
[23:56:32] <coldhead> friday 6pm

[23:56:57] <Gates> coldhead: yay :] thnx
[23:57:03] <coldhead> a time to watch foreign movies and think about stained glass
[23:57:05] <Gates> only issue is if u drag ur mouse out of the box
[23:57:08] <Gates> it glitches ;\
[23:57:39] <Trisox> coldhead: :(
