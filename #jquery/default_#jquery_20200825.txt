[08:17:41] <Octalgenesis> hi
[15:33:28] <baruna> hi, is there an easy way how to select all href attributes with duplicate names?
[15:33:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:34:10] <robertmaxrees> baruna you select elements, not attributes :)
[15:34:38] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to select all <a> tags what have matching values for their href attribute?
[15:34:42] <baruna> find('tr[name="definice"]:gt(0)') - this selects all tr's with name definice except the first one
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[15:35:12] <robertmaxrees> (still not clear on what you're asking :) )
[15:35:19] <baruna> I want to select all tr's with any name.. except the first one
[15:35:39] <robertmaxrees> confused lol
[15:35:42] <robertmaxrees> looks like you have it?
[15:35:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise make a fiddle :)
[15:36:59] <baruna> well, ok, let's say I have <tr name="a"><tr name="b"><tr name="b"><tr name="c"><tr name ="c"><tr name="c">... but I want to have only one <tr name="a">,<tr name="b">.. etc.. so I want to select the dupes and remove them
[15:37:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:37:45] <robertmaxrees> please don't make me create the fiddle :)
[15:38:06] <baruna> I could make a list of the names and loop through them and remove them.. or I could invent some selector possibly? :D
[15:38:25] <baruna> robertmaxrees: wait a sec for the fiddle please
[15:39:06] <robertmaxrees> also: how are you getting duplicates in the first place?  why not prevent that from happening instead?
[15:41:39] <baruna> robertmaxrees: the original dupes are valid.
[15:41:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  okay.
[15:45:42] <robertmaxrees> so a really simple test case would be this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aq1tcf7s/
[15:45:54] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you trying to select based on name and not class?
[15:47:21] <baruna> then I would need many classes.. for each row
[15:49:02] <robertmaxrees> also: trs can't have names.
[15:49:24] <robertmaxrees> so you're gonna need to find an alternative.
[15:49:49] <baruna> why tr's can't have names? I use them normally
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/name
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> it's invalid.
[15:50:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're using them on TRs, you'll want to stop.
[15:50:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:50:38] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to specify with that attribute?
[15:51:09] <baruna> name of input property
[15:51:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:51:28] <robertmaxrees> names should only be on inputs :)
[15:51:54] <robertmaxrees> and a few other select elements.
[15:51:55] <baruna> but some rows have several inputes
[15:52:01] <baruna> in my case
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> then use a data attribute.
[15:52:22] <robertmaxrees> data-inputGroup, for instance.
[15:53:42] <baruna> hm ok thatÍ„'s one possible solution too
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> then you cna proceed :)
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> baruna so the idea is you get the data-inputgroup value (use .data('inputgroup') for that), then filter down all $('tr') with a matching data-inputgroup value.
[15:57:48] <robertmaxrees> bonus points if you use a function for filter;
[16:02:10] <baruna> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/v6zo48uq/ < this is my other idea how to do it, lol
[16:02:35] <robertmaxrees> so again
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> trs can't have name attributes.
[16:03:17] <robertmaxrees> also: that's a really inefficient way to do that.  gonna cause yourself big headaches.
[16:03:46] <robertmaxrees> don't need to .each() to .remove(), to boot.
[16:03:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aq1tcf7s/
[16:04:09] <robertmaxrees> here's the minimal way, though I'm noticing something kinda funny here.
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> I'm guessing you're trying to clone a table and you're removing stuff that was added/changed?
[16:05:04] <baruna> yes, basically
[16:05:16] <robertmaxrees> there's a way to do that that's 1000x easier than this.
[16:06:52] <baruna> mostly importantly I didn't know there was data() :)
[16:07:04] <baruna> and filter()
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't need any of that though.
[16:07:49] <baruna> so what's the best way? :)
[16:07:56] <robertmaxrees> just clone the first table when the page first loads, then clone that particular clone every time you need a new one.
[16:09:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aq1tcf7s/15/
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:10:20] <baruna> robertmaxrees: the thing is in my case on same pages the tables are not empty but filled with data. a <table> stands for word sense/meaning. but when I want to add a new sense, than cloning the first table would mean cloning the filled data as well
[16:10:53] <robertmaxrees> Then take it a step further - provide a hidden "template" somewhere on the page.
[16:11:17] <robertmaxrees> it'll save you a ton of time/headaches and it'll be more efficient, to boot.
[16:12:22] <baruna> the javascript/jquery part of my project is fun.. and definitely more easy than the python/django part :D
[16:12:33] <robertmaxrees> (this is a great example of when a client-side templating engine is a good idea)
[16:18:03] <baruna> robertmaxrees: anyway, tnx for your help again :)
[16:23:32] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:35:00] <baruna> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/v6zo48uq/1/ using your fiddle.. what am I missing here that it doesn't remove the dupes? :/
[16:35:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:35:58] <robertmaxrees> your'e using it wrong lol.
[16:36:13] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that .each()
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> wait sorry.
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> formatting threw me off.
[16:37:35] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:37:40] <robertmaxrees> $(this).filter(function() { - this is your issue.
[16:38:08] <robertmaxrees> needs to point to the TRs of the new table.
[16:38:12] <robertmaxrees> not just $(this)
[16:38:39] <robertmaxrees> also: $(document).find('table:first').clone(); - this is just $('table:first') ;)
[16:39:29] <baruna> https://jsfiddle.net/v6zo48uq/2/ < tnx!!!
[16:39:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5pq864e0/4/ <-
[21:08:12] <kmcisaac> Good day everyone, mind if I ask a question in regards to jQuery UI and how to potentially do something?
[21:08:30] <robertmaxrees> that's the point of the channel :)
[21:11:35] <kmcisaac> lol, thanks. I'm trying to use jQuery UI Tabs and I'm trying to dynamically add tabs from a regular JS function. Basically the function runs some PHP code via AJAX and based on it's result will generate a new tab. The problem is, for some reason I can't seem to be able to get a new tab to generate. All the examples I see show it being generated via a button which uses a jQuery click method, but nothing
[21:11:35] <kmcisaac> about generating one from external code.
[21:12:01] <robertmaxrees> mind creating a jsfiddle with your code?
[21:15:16] <kmcisaac> It doesn't like the styles I got set on it, but let me grab the link for my server right quick.
[21:15:26] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle would be much better
[21:15:32] <robertmaxrees> so i can more easily see the code in question
[21:16:49] <kmcisaac> Let me pop it up there. One moment. :-)
[21:16:54] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[21:18:22] <kmcisaac> https://jsfiddle.net/kylemcisaac/mytzurjd/2/
[21:18:57] <robertmaxrees> Mind whittling the js down to JUST the stuff for the adding of tabs? :)
[21:19:44] <kmcisaac> https://jsfiddle.net/kylemcisaac/mytzurjd/4/ There we go
[21:20:04] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[21:20:37] <kmcisaac> I'm using the "Send" button as a test to send commands to the function.
[21:20:56] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[21:21:00] <robertmaxrees> onclick is no good :)
[21:21:19] <robertmaxrees> do you notice the JS error when you click the send button?
[21:21:52] <kmcisaac> Oh, I know, that's just to quickly pound the command to it with the same details I'm going to be sending from the AJAX request.
[21:22:26] <robertmaxrees> using onclick is your first problem is what I'm saying.
[21:22:32] <kmcisaac> Yeah, I keep seeing how it can't find the function addTabWVars.
[21:22:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because that function doesn't exist in the right scope.
[21:22:56] <robertmaxrees> so swap to .on() for now :)
[21:28:40] <kmcisaac> Just got it running some dummy code to the console now. on /9/
[21:29:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:29:03] <robertmaxrees> just send the link ;)
[21:29:11] <kmcisaac> https://jsfiddle.net/kylemcisaac/mytzurjd/10/
[21:29:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah... so now bind that function :)
[21:31:29] <kmcisaac> Okay, now I'm a bit confused. lol; relatively new with doing jQuery commands so it's a bit foreign to me.
[21:31:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw they'
[21:31:42] <robertmaxrees> *they aren't "commands" :)
[21:31:45] <robertmaxrees> it's just code.
[21:32:31] <robertmaxrees> so what functions are you trying to call?
[21:33:48] <kmcisaac> Essentially, whenever my timed AJAX function runs and it has, for example, "new" in it's result, I need it to call the addTabWVars (or something similar) with what values it's looking for.
[21:34:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so put the function call in that event handler :)
[21:36:44] <kmcisaac> Even though they're in two separate areas?
[21:37:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to move that event binding to be inside the doc ready, as well.
[21:38:32] <robertmaxrees> we'll jump forward a bit: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e6xr2uh5/1/
[21:38:43] <robertmaxrees> that's using the two functions you were using before.
[21:39:40] <kmcisaac> https://jsfiddle.net/kylemcisaac/mytzurjd/16/ I got the button doing the action, but now how would I tell an outside function to run that same code?
[21:40:14] <robertmaxrees> why did you switch from .on() to .bind()?  .bind() is basically deprecated.
[21:40:34] <robertmaxrees> secondly, run what same code?
[21:41:13] <kmcisaac> What the button is doing right now. The button won't be generating the tabs in the long run, it'll be code (which was stripped out from the beginning) that will be making the tab.
[21:41:29] <robertmaxrees> can you show that code?
[21:44:48] <kmcisaac> https://jsfiddle.net/kylemcisaac/mytzurjd/18/
[21:45:43] <robertmaxrees> why not move that function to inside the document ready?
[21:46:03] <kmcisaac> Okay, so that can just get tossed in there and it'll run as normal with the timers?
[21:46:37] <robertmaxrees> so long as the timer is in there, too.
[21:46:43] <robertmaxrees> do you understand variable scope?
[21:48:07] <kmcisaac> I seem to be catching a better grip on it now.
[21:48:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:48:48] <kmcisaac> So anything that's in $( ) will be just straight-up document functions (but in the jQuery scope)
[21:48:57] <robertmaxrees> ermm.
[21:48:59] <robertmaxrees> no haha
[21:49:03] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec and I'll explain.
[21:49:33] <kmcisaac> This is essentially VLANs in networking to me; I hate VLANs... lol
[21:49:45] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really.
[21:49:48] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[21:51:43] <robertmaxrees> (Sorry - have to take care of something)
[21:51:58] <kmcisaac> No worries. :-)
[21:53:05] <robertmaxrees> okay so it has nothing to do with document ready necessarily - it's functions.
[21:54:12] <robertmaxrees> kmcisaac so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/38rcpy2h/
[21:54:24] <robertmaxrees> in this case - someVar is available inside of foo, but not outside.
[21:54:48] <robertmaxrees> you can only access variables declared in your current or parent scope.
[21:55:16] <robertmaxrees> so going a step further: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/38rcpy2h/2/
[21:55:37] <robertmaxrees> you can access someVar inside of bar, as well, since foo was declared in a parent scope.
[21:55:40] <robertmaxrees> make sense so far?
[21:56:26] <kmcisaac> Yep! So, where bar is inside of foo, it'll be able to access it, but where the last one is outside of foo, it can't access it.
[21:56:52] <robertmaxrees> Ye.
[21:56:58] <robertmaxrees> *Yeah
[21:58:09] <robertmaxrees> so it's not "jquery scope", just the function you're using for document ready.
[21:58:15] <kmcisaac> So most of my tab manipulation stuff (which is the generation) will occur inside of the $( ) scope.
[21:58:32] <robertmaxrees> not "the $() scope" - the function being used for document ready.
[21:59:24] <robertmaxrees> $() is just a function like any other.  you're passing it a function to run on document ready.  subtle difference in terminology, but one that helps you build the mental model.
[21:59:31] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a major issue with your html.
[22:00:39] <kmcisaac> Oh? I didn't realize.
[22:00:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[22:00:56] <robertmaxrees> can only use an ID once per page.
[22:02:00] <kmcisaac> Oh! I'll change that right away; I was planning on making that be the message ID anyway.
[22:02:19] <robertmaxrees> use a data-id or something for that.
[22:02:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:03:15] <kmcisaac> On the MySQL side, there's a timestamp-based ID that's going to get generated; I'll probably have that populate in the ID.
[22:03:27] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that, either.
[22:12:57] <kmcisaac> I'll delve down that rabbit hole sooner or later. Time to dig deep into the generation of new tabs! Thanks for your help, it's extremely appreciated!
[23:17:27] <tona> how can I export one html table to excel file using jquery
[23:17:34] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[23:17:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[23:18:57] <tona> then how could I do it with compatibilty with Safari
[23:20:02] <robertmaxrees> is the table something you created or something you're trying to pull of another site?
[23:20:21] <tona> I created that table
[23:20:44] <robertmaxrees> then why not just output the table as a CSV on your server using your backend?
[23:21:41] <tona> usigin jquery
[23:21:51] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be via client-side js?
[23:22:18] <robertmaxrees> jquery don't "speak" that language.  jquery can be used to grab and manipulate the page.  something else would need to do the second half.
[23:23:42] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[23:24:26] <tona> I have one json in my backend is there one way to export it to csv file
[23:24:42] <robertmaxrees> you could convert it to csv.
[23:25:11] <robertmaxrees> or wait.
[23:25:24] <robertmaxrees> maybe excel and just open the JSON file.  have you looked into that?
[23:25:58] <tona> not yet
[23:26:38] <tona> but I was thinking to click on one link and after using one axios call and get the json anwer and finally convert it into xls file
[23:27:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a really roundabout way to do that.
[23:27:20] <tona> then how should I do it
[23:27:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[23:27:26] <tona> :)
[23:27:29] <robertmaxrees> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-data-from-external-data-sources-power-query-be4330b3-5356-486c-a168-b68e9e616f5a
[23:27:37] <robertmaxrees> there ya go.  open the json file directly.
[23:27:40] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[23:28:08] <robertmaxrees> look for the bit that says "connect to a JSON file"
[23:28:30] <tona> ok thanks
[23:31:54] <sydbarret> how can i replicate this autocomplete in address? not needed the search button
[23:31:58] <sydbarret> spothero.com
[23:32:34] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret vague question - you mean how do you get it to search on each letter you type in?
[23:32:49] <sydbarret> yeah
[23:32:53] <sydbarret> i think its with this https://ubilabs.github.io/geocomplete/?
[23:33:06] <robertmaxrees> err.
[23:33:08] <sydbarret> its only for US
[23:33:09] <robertmaxrees> 2 different questions.
[23:33:30] <robertmaxrees> if you're asking how to build an autocomplete like that, you listen to the "input" event on the input.
[23:33:56] <robertmaxrees> if you're asking how to build out an address autocomplete, just use google's or something similar and call it a day.
[23:34:21] <sydbarret> its just a lib innit? let me try that link
[23:34:29] <robertmaxrees> "it's just a lib" - no.
[23:34:39] <sydbarret> its a cdn library
[23:34:43] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[23:34:55] <robertmaxrees> the dataset for addresses is bigger than you'd get in a library.
[23:35:04] <sydbarret> how do you call this <script src="jquery.geocomplete.js"></script>?
[23:35:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[23:35:20] <robertmaxrees> you include it on your page.
[23:35:28] <robertmaxrees> and then follow the instructions to initialize it and go from there.
[23:36:02] <sydbarret> is that a good one? or you use another one
[23:36:16] <robertmaxrees> i've used a few.  they all have their plusses and minuses.
