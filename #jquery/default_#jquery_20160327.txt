[07:23:34] <DeanDean> Hello :)
[07:24:07] <DeanDean> I'm having a weird issue with jQuery UI...I'm a bit of a newbie and can't seem to figure out why it's being stubborn
[07:24:27] <DeanDean> I'm running this code:
[07:24:27] <DeanDean>     $("#section__info__what").hover(function() {        $( profileWhatPathlines ).animate({         backgroundColor: "#FFBF28",         color: "#FFBF28",         width: 10       }, 1000 );     }
[07:24:45] <DeanDean> It DOES animate it, but does not color it.
[07:25:10] <DeanDean> Anyone out there with thought on how to fix this?
[07:34:29] <PCatinean_> cfg_price_div.insertAfter($('<div>').addClass('col-sm-4 text-right').append(price, currency));
[07:34:37] <PCatinean_> since the first var is a div, how come nothing happens after I execute this
[07:34:45] <PCatinean_> cfg_price_div is the same as when it started
[08:18:40] <PCatinean_> Can someone help me user the after() method on newly created elements?

[14:30:57] <albedoa> hello, i am using $(window).resize() to check to see if a DOM element has been resized. is there a way to monitor or attach an event to the resizing of the element itself?
[14:41:32] <albedoa> i could use a timeout
[14:51:36] <jak2000> $(".divConfig").click(function() {    <-- how to add other class(Same event?)
[14:52:17] <albedoa> jak2000 $(this).addClass()
[14:53:25] <jak2000> man but i have a divConfig2 i want specify here:
[14:53:45] <jak2000> $(".divConfig .divConfig").click(function() {  <---- not work
[14:55:04] <jak2000> done :)
[15:04:23] <jak2000> how to optimize this code: http://pastebin.com/ezJb1Y2k    ?
[15:09:52] <albedoa> you're using classes very strangely
[15:10:03] <albedoa> first of all, "div" is described by the element type
[15:10:21] <albedoa> that kind of Hungarian class naming is very odd and counterproductive
[15:10:51] <albedoa> just have a class .config and put it in divs
[15:11:25] <albedoa> also don't number them
[15:11:39] <albedoa> then you can just remove the class from all .config divs
[15:11:44] <albedoa> and add it to the one that's clicked

[15:54:12] <joaco> Hello, is there a way to group events? let's say that somebody clicks a div element several times in a second, like crazily click a div, is there a way to see when it stops and trigger an event when that happens?
[16:04:23] <robhol> out of the box? probably not. You'd have to do it manually.
[16:04:56] <decx> do a timeout on click that gets cancelled on click
[16:05:35] <joaco> I don't get how to do that
[16:07:39] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/245eadm0/
[16:10:07] <xdo> can you help me ? https://jsfiddle.net/bilbon10/ntacdbra/1/ :)
[16:10:17] <xdo> I try to remove
[16:10:31] <decx> really went all out trying there
[16:23:19] <joaco> decx, thanks! it worked!!
[16:52:44] <geri> hi decx
[17:09:56] <BenderRodriguez> Does anyone know of a nice, no-nonsense slider?
[17:10:03] <BenderRodriguez> perhaps one that uses CSS translations?
[18:16:11] <geri> what datatype is $('#myCanvas').attr('height') ?
[18:22:00] <geri> this returns a string...will i need to manually convert it to a number?
[19:11:15] <boann> hi, how can i set i brouwser reload on false so when i click on i link, the url is set in the brouwser whit do notting
[19:36:02] <bambanx> guys i am using jquery for get the id using .attr  all my ids are "serv-1", "serv-2", "serv-3" so on....  how i can get only the number?
[21:58:31] <owlr> hi
[21:58:57] <owlr> How can I highlight multiple divs with effect('highlight') ?
[21:59:39] <owlr> say i have div ids d1, d2, d3, d4, i want to highlight d2 and d4 simultaneously
[22:00:18] <snover> what have you tried?
[22:00:24] <owlr> i've tried to do that with a for() loop, but it gets laggy and slow
[22:00:47] <owlr> because i am highlighting more than 5 divs at once
[22:01:19] <snover> do you know how css selectors work?
[22:01:41] <owlr> yes, how is it related?
[22:01:59] <snover> how do you select 5 div elements with a css selector?
[22:02:10] <snover> with one css selector.
[22:02:47] <owlr> $('#d1 #d2')
[22:02:55] <owlr> like this
[22:03:02] <owlr> but it does't work with effect
[22:03:24] <snover> nope, thatâ€™s wrong. that selects #d2 inside of #d1.
[22:03:55] <diegoviola> hi
[22:04:10] <diegoviola> I want to force my scroll to go to a specific anchor ID from JS, any ideas how to achieve this?
[22:04:51] <owlr> ah, it should contain commas
[22:05:22] <owlr> now it's working, thanks
[22:10:01] <diegoviola> nvm
[22:20:44] <owlr> any idea why when i do that with $('#d1,d2,...').effect('hightlight', {}, 2000), if I trigger this event multiple times in a second, some of divs may start highlighting with a big delay
[22:20:56] <owlr> ?
[22:22:21] <owlr> when i trigger it for a first time, all the divs appear highlighted at once, but if I retrigger right after the first one, it starts lagging
[22:23:03] <snover> effects are chained.
[22:25:02] <owlr> so they wait until each other is finished?
[22:25:39] <owlr> is there any workaround to make them asynchronous?
[22:25:52] <snover> they are asynchronous. and chained.
[22:27:19] <owlr> so i guess it's impossible to make them working like i described in that case, right?
[22:27:36] <owlr> because it looks like they are chained by default by jquery initialization
[22:27:40] <owlr> i haven't chained them
[22:28:40] <snover> you should consider reading the api documentation for the method you are using
[22:32:20] <owlr> i've understood now, 'chained' in that case means the each effect waits for another to finish building up if it's the same div
[22:32:42] <owlr> it's what i've described previously, i guess i should make a kind of queue
