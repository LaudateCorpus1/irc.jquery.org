[00:59:28] <ThatWebGuy> Hi everyone.  I have this code to read my page list with nested children to put them into JSON to be processed by some PHP.  I can't figure out why I have children showing on every main list item.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/x3cv2L86/11/
[06:48:43] <Abhijit> Hi. How can I take screenshot of div on click? this div might not have ID.
[13:17:03] <Bit-2> hello, am in a phase of brain storming a huge project for a native app (mobile app) and was wondering witch solution i should use, alot in the internet tells to go to angular or vue , but i preffered jquery and am a biggener in jquery, my question is is there any major changes will come in jquery ? making me stuck with the major updates ? plus does it support all ajax elements (functions) , and how secure is it when it comes to script kiddies when it comes to on
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:18:04] <robertmaxrees> Bit-2 that's a bizarre question - are you looking to make a native app or a mobile site?
[13:18:19] <Bit-2> native/mobile app
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> then none of those technologies are going to be appropriate.
[13:18:57] <Bit-2> ouh, can you declare more ?
[13:19:25] <robertmaxrees> for starters: angular, vue, and jquery are all web technologies.  not intended for native apps.
[13:19:40] <sol1d> check out xammerin for mobile app
[13:19:48] <Bit-2> but phone call enables me to use JS in general
[13:19:54] <Bit-2> so its going to be a native app
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:20:06] <Bit-2> wrapped in a mobile form app
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> okay - so you're using something like Cordova?
[13:20:44] <Bit-2> phonegap -> ios -> android -> html apk files
[13:20:49] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:20:54] <Bit-2> yep, cordova
[13:21:12] <robertmaxrees> second issue: angular and vue solve a different problem than jQuery.
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> so i wouldn't compare them,
[13:21:41] <Bit-2> this is what am trying to find, all internet sources i incounter doesnt show a clear picture
[13:22:01] <robertmaxrees> heh, because there's no picture ;)
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery is just a dom manipulation library.  vue and angular are frameworks.
[13:22:22] <Bit-2> kind of true, am studing now jquery from a to z
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> if I were you, I'd look at vue, react, or angular.
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> not "kind of true" - it IS true ;)
[13:22:48] <Bit-2> then its true hehee :)
[13:23:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you planning on building?
[13:23:45] <Bit-2> an application that manages product stocks , and analize the customers behaivors
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> then i DEFINITELY wouldn't use jquery for that.
[13:24:16] <Bit-2> the the server side is diffrenet story, but the challenging part is the customers side (mobile app)
[13:24:33] <Bit-2> but jquery can be the layout for it
[13:24:39] <Bit-2> mainly its going to be php
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> with the functionality that you're going to be looking for, vue, react, and angular are going to be much better choices.
[13:25:31] <Bit-2> ill take a look at it
[13:25:53] <Bit-2> as you said and am doing focusing on the DOM manupilations
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:50] <Bit-2> from 1 to 10 , who is the best react or angular or vue ?
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[13:27:16] <robertmaxrees> none are
[13:27:35] <robertmaxrees> they all have different strengths and weaknesses.
[13:27:53] <Bit-2> because the main functions of the mobile os ?
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> they all approach similar problems in different ways.
[13:28:23] <Bit-2> hmmm
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> if you're familiar with java, angular is a pretty natural choice.  react + redux (or another similar flux library) is awesome, though takes some getting used to since it's more functional in style.
[13:29:18] <robertmaxrees> vue gets a lot of love these days.  easy to use and wrap your head around.
[13:29:31] <Bit-2> well am aware of javascripts and java programming
[13:29:57] <Bit-2> yeah i heard from a head of dev team in a bank , telling me to try vue..
[13:32:21] <Bit-2> anyways manythanks.
[13:54:11] <Guest48> I'm working with Sortable for the first time and I'm having an issue getting a JSON array of top level items with any children.  Is this possible?
[13:54:54] <robertmaxrees> Guest48 can you show us what you have?
[13:55:06] <Guest48> Sure.  Let me create a fiddle with it.
[14:01:57] <Guest48> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/os7m8znv/
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> missing sortable?
[14:03:02] <Guest48> Oh, I didn't put the URL in the fiddle.  My bad.
[14:05:41] <Guest48> robertmaxrees here's the updated link https://jsfiddle.net/os7m8znv/2/
[14:05:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> something seems off.
[14:06:41] <robertmaxrees> ah, just no css.
[14:06:42] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/seh0qfk1/
[14:06:50] <robertmaxrees> use "resources" on the left to include extra stuff lkike that.
[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> *like
[14:07:43] <robertmaxrees> so .serialize() is for form elements.
[14:07:57] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm: https://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize
[14:07:59] <Guest48> Okay.  Thanks for letting me know about that on fiddle.
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs - "Serializes the sortable's item ids into a form/ajax submittable string [...]"
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> you're missing IDs.
[14:09:08] <Guest48> I've logged it but it's not giving me a way to show what items are child elements and who they belong to.
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/seh0qfk1/3/ this is giving me an empty console log.
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/seh0qfk1/7/ you have to format the IDs a particular way if you want to use the serialize method.
[14:16:53] <Guest48> Yeah i've done that before but it's not showing me the children.  That's the part I'm lost with.
[14:18:42] <robertmaxrees> ah, got it.  sorry, coffee's taking its time kicking in today :)  afaict you'll have to manually roll that yourself.
[14:19:58] <Guest48> Okay.  Do you mind if I show you another version I tried and maybe you can tell me what I did wrong?
[14:20:04] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:22:19] <Guest48> When I run this on my local machine, https://jsfiddle.net/5h93dqeo/1/
[14:23:03] <Guest48> I get an array of 2x the number of parent objects and each children area shows the same number of children for each item even when they have no children.
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> is that a complete example
[14:23:15] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:23:25] <robertmaxrees> because createPageJSON doesn't actually return anything, so the log is undefined
[14:24:15] <Guest48> Sorry, here you go https://jsfiddle.net/5h93dqeo/2/
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> so your first issue is you're doing $('.page-children').children().each(function() { within $('.pages').children().each(function() {
[14:25:54] <Guest48> Okay.  Sorry, I'm still new to JS in general.
[14:25:56] <robertmaxrees> which means you're reselecting all .page-children on the page every time, when you likely want to scope that down.
[14:26:14] <robertmaxrees> so really that should be $(this).find('.page-children')
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> .children().each(
[14:26:56] <Es0teric> if i have two select fields and I want to detect on change of both of them and get their .text() values would it be best to just grab all of them, loop through them and do an on('change') event for them to detect when they have been updated?
[14:27:25] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you don't need to do any looping.
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> $('select').on('change', function() {});
[14:27:39] <Es0teric> hmm
[14:27:46] <Es0teric> but how can i tell which one was used?
[14:27:58] <robertmaxrees> $(this) will be the one that was changed.
[14:28:08] <Es0teric> yeah i thought
[14:28:24] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[14:28:42] <Es0teric> nah i was just over thinking it
[14:28:50] <Es0teric> i was just wondering what the best approach would be
[14:28:50] <robertmaxrees> oh hah alrighty.
[14:28:54] <Guest48> robertmaxrees that fixed all of them showing they had children.  The only weird thing I have now is that the parent items are doubling up on my local machine.
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> Guest48 show an updated fiddle?
[14:29:47] <Guest48> https://jsfiddle.net/5h93dqeo/3/
[14:30:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees what if i want to get the name of the selected element that contains the name meta
[14:30:30] <Guest48> The odd thing, is it's not doing it in the fiddle.  Just my local machine on the $.post
[14:30:34] <robertmaxrees> Guest48 i'm not seeing the doubling you're talking about.
[14:30:49] <robertmaxrees> Guest48 heh - so what's different between the two?
[14:30:57] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric "name meta"??
[14:31:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean the name attribute?
[14:31:51] <Es0teric> i have something like this: <select id="artist_territory" name="artist_territory"> and another select like this: <select id="artist_label" name="artist_label">
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> so the name attribute?
[14:32:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:32:04] <Es0teric> yeah
[14:32:05] <Es0teric> attribute
[14:32:08] <Es0teric> there we go
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('name')
[14:32:22] <Es0teric> wow prop
[14:32:24] <Es0teric> thats what i was looking for
[14:32:35] <robertmaxrees> .attr() is a thing, too, but 9/10 you want .prop()
[14:33:17] <Es0teric> yeah
[14:33:23] <Es0teric> i figured it would be .prop
[14:34:56] <Guest48> robertmaxrees Here is an update.  I have the post commented out so it doesn't throw an error. https://jsfiddle.net/5h93dqeo/4/
[14:35:51] <robertmaxrees> ah, heh, simple - you're declaring those as global vars and then updating them.
[14:35:57] <robertmaxrees> which you shouldn't do.
[14:36:38] <Guest48> Okay.
[14:36:45] <Guest48> How should I handle it then?
[14:37:00] <robertmaxrees> declare those vars at the top of the function and then return records.
[14:37:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ts50n49d/1/
[14:39:00] <Guest48> Awesome.  That worked
[14:39:29] <robertmaxrees> basically, avoid global vars like the plague.
[14:40:10] <Guest48> Okay.  I will make sure to remember that.  Thanks for your help.
[14:43:39] <Guest48> So I see that the data I pass must be a PlainObject.  How can I append items to a Object?
[14:43:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:44:25] <robertmaxrees> the first sentence is where you lost me - where does it say the data must be a "plainobject"?
[14:45:14] <Guest48> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:45:19] <Guest48> Or a string
[14:45:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/Types/#PlainObject
[14:45:43] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see what's going on here.
[14:46:07] <robertmaxrees> if you swap to plain ol' $.ajax you can ship the array.
[14:47:22] <Guest48> Okay.  Thanks again.
[14:47:36] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[14:47:37] <Guest48> Now I can send it to my php code to move it to the database and update.
[14:48:12] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:58:03] <Es0teric> if i use let some_var outside of an on change event, i can set it in the scope of the on change event correct?
[14:58:14] <robertmaxrees> yes, but you shouldn't do that.
[14:58:24] <Es0teric> why not?
[14:58:46] <robertmaxrees> global state vars are a great way to introduce bugs, like the one I just helped solve in here a few ago :)
[14:59:09] <Es0teric> so then what should i use? const?
[14:59:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:59:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean any object, period.
[14:59:36] <Es0teric> -_-
[14:59:38] <robertmaxrees> and you wouldn't be able to use const in this case anyway.
[15:00:40] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need some kind of state object?
[15:03:26] <Es0teric> i am just trying a couple of things out
[15:07:06] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yeah, hand-rolling state objects like that is generally something you'd want to avoid.  great way to introduce bugs and cause yourself headaches.  tends to be a code smell.
[16:06:11] <snatcher> why when .bind() 'dragover' event.dataTransfer.dropEffect is undefined but event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.dropEffect not?
[16:06:33] <robertmaxrees> can you show in a fiddle?
[16:07:12] <snatcher> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14788862/drag-drop-doenst-not-work-dropeffect-of-undefined/ so question with the same problem
[16:07:35] <robertmaxrees> soi
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> *so
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> can you show in a fiddle?
[16:07:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jquery are you using?
[16:09:38] <snatcher> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ nevermind that behavior described here >To access event properties not listed above, use the event.originalEvent object
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> fwiw .bind() was depecated in 3.0 - should be using .on() instead.
[16:43:15] <nug700> I set the width of all my table cells (well, the div inside), but the table containing them isn't resizing....
[16:44:33] <nug700> Like with the chrome html inspector, I hover over the html for the table cells and it shows them in the correct place and size, but the table's width is stuck at 0
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want #html
[16:46:36] <nug700> well I generate everything with jquery
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:47:39] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - jquery likely isn't the reason you're having problems.  2 - you'll have much better luck with a test case via jsfiddle.
[16:49:04] <nug700> Problem with jsfiddle though is there's ~4000 lines of it that generate everything.
[16:49:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not a test case ;)
[16:49:24] <robertmaxrees> just need the bare minimum to replicate the issue.
[16:49:38] <nug700> the bare minimum is like 2000 lines.
[16:49:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:49:47] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it but alright :)
[16:56:58] <nug700> It is jquery, though. The table is actually the correct size. But the size being reported by outerWidth is 0. But developer tools shows that is the correct size  (I use table width to set the width of container div).
[16:57:27] <nug700> developer tools shows that the table is the correct width*
[16:57:58] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the issue, it's difficult to help.
[17:08:55] <nug700> robertmaxrees: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdu3vhkvhl5xreu/Screenshot%202019-09-09%2014.08.41.png?dl=0
[17:09:55] <nug700> https://pastebin.com/m3nGPR6Z
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> i mean this as nicely as possible, but how is a screenshot supposed to help me figure out the problem?
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> is the table visible when you're doing the outerWidth() call?
[17:11:53] <nug700> The console prints the jquery object, which when moused over in the log highlights the table, as shown.
[17:13:03] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[17:13:07] <nug700> in line 6 of the paste, it prints the table to the log, showing that the tbl variable is set correctly to the table. However, outerwidth called on line 8 is returning 0
[17:17:58] <nug700> visibility is set to visible, yes
[17:33:12] <nug700> So... yes, this is genuinely a bug in jquery. I use functions to generate the tables, which work the first time. I then reset the table by removing and rebuilding it, at which point the width functions stop working.
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> wait - you're removing them and rebuilding the,?
[17:33:42] <robertmaxrees> *them
[17:34:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you manually select it after it's recreated?  instead of relying on that stored object.
[17:34:18] <nug700> Yes. I have a Clear() function that rebuilds the table that I call when I need to reset the options lists.
[17:35:17] <nug700> I'll give it id's and see if using the ID instead of the cached jquery object
[17:35:22] <nug700> works
[17:36:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> the "cached" object stops existing.
[17:38:28] <nug700> But when I printed it in the log, it existed
[17:38:37] <nug700> and highlighted the correct table
[17:38:44] <nug700> in the screenshot
[17:38:50] <robertmaxrees> my guess is that things aren't getting rebuild/cleared the way you think they are.
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> *rebuilt
[17:39:46] <nug700> I checked that. I remove the cached chunk object in tables[id].CachedChunk, then set it again when I call the function to build it again.
[17:40:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, my guess is something in that process is breaking down.
[17:42:52] <nug700> ok... I see the problem.
[17:43:27] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[17:44:22] <nug700> line 44: https://pastebin.com/qMHatrXC
[17:44:34] <nug700> It's a reference to the VARIABLE
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> oh woah
[17:44:56] <nug700> So when the variable changes, it changes
[17:45:22] <nug700> I changed it to 'let', and when it went out of scope it cleared the object
[17:45:47] <nug700> I have to make a copy of the object probably
[17:45:54] <robertmaxrees> y'all ever consider using a templating engine and/or a real framework for this?
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> hand rolling a bunch of boilerplate there.
[17:46:33] <nug700> If I could I'd do this in C#
[17:46:43] <nug700> as a standalone app
[17:46:52] <nug700> but company wants to use it in a web browser
[17:47:29] <nug700> technically this is using bootstrap
[17:47:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but i mean like vue or react angular.
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> *react or angular
[17:48:29] <nug700> Maybe if I knew them... this is way too far along to start over.
[17:48:52] <robertmaxrees> just for future consideration :)
[17:53:46] <nug700> This is awfull
[18:00:47] <nug700> Like... I gave the table an id "<id>_chunk_<n>". Call prop('id') on that id and it returns the correct, but call to outerWidth immediatly after that does not return the right thing
[18:01:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you've got an order of operations thing going on somewhere.
[18:03:02] <nug700> what do you mean?
[18:04:16] <robertmaxrees> doing anything with ajax and/or fetch?
[18:05:56] <nug700> hm, could be.
[18:06:26] <nug700> I build the table once, then do my call to clear(), then do the .post() call to fill in the table.
[18:06:38] <nug700> Should probably do it after the .post returns
[18:06:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> $.post() you mean?
[18:07:03] <nug700> yea
[18:07:07] <robertmaxrees> that's ajax.
[18:07:11] <nug700> yea
[18:07:25] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on that finishing needs to be in the .then()
[18:08:51] <nug700> I do it like so: "$.post(API, params, function(data, status){ <on complete code>});"
[18:09:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd swap to using .then()
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, anything that relies on that call finishing needs to be in the callback/.then()
[18:09:51] <nug700> how would that change it? like $.post(API, params).then(function{...})?
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  promises are favored over traditional callbacks these days.
[18:10:41] <nug700> Not sure that's the promise with my table width function not working
[18:10:47] <nug700> thats the problem*
[18:11:09] <robertmaxrees> code health tho :)
[18:11:16] <robertmaxrees> also: $(tbl_row).on('mousedown', function(){ - you should look into using delegated handlers instead.
[18:24:26] <nug700> Well, at least it's 'fixed'
[18:24:48] <nug700> I mean, jquery is still broken but I just cached the original values.
[18:24:56] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:25:19] <robertmaxrees> it's likely not an issue with jQuery.  if you believe you found a bug, by all means submit a report.
[19:23:18] <nug700> Better solution was to just make it not delete the table or any of it's rows and columns; just re-use the exact same elements.
