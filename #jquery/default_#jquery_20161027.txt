[00:28:56] <arnsa> hello
[00:29:14] <arnsa> let's say I add some data to the element like this: $('p').data('foo', 'bar')
[00:29:26] <arnsa> is it possible to detect data changes on p element somehow?
[01:31:56] <jak2000> $('.myScroll').animate({scrollTop: $("#xDiv1_" + idMaster).offset().top -100 }, 'slow');
[01:32:00] <jak2000> why: Uncraught type error: cannot rady property 'top' or undefined ?
[01:32:02] <jak2000> any advice?
[01:35:55] <sdwrage> Hey all. I have a script that does  a Cross Domain request to access a custom API but the ajax call doesn't happen until onunload happens. Since this is CORS based, I've heard I can't set the async: false if its CORS based so if the browser window closes before the preflight request returns a response, I lose the chance to send my data. Is there a good solution for this?
[01:37:19] <systemfault> sdwrage: It probably works if it's CORS-based.
[01:37:19] <Uhkis> jak2000: is that div visible?
[01:37:38] <systemfault> sdwrage: It won't work if it's JSONP-based crap though
[01:37:45] <systemfault> Since it's not ajax at all
[01:37:52] <jak2000> Uhkis yess
[01:37:52] <sdwrage> systemfault, so async should work even if its CORS based?
[01:38:06] <jak2000> .myScroll yess
[01:38:13] <systemfault> sdwrage: I wouldn't bet my life on it but I wouldn't be surprised if it worked fine.
[01:38:13] <jak2000> #xDiv1_  not
[01:38:20] <Uhkis> jak2000: there's your problem
[01:38:25] <sdwrage> okay ill retry this
[01:38:31] <jak2000> how to fix?
[01:38:34] <Uhkis> jak2000: from the docs: display:none is excluded from the rendering tree and thus has a position that is undefined.
[01:39:44] <Uhkis> jak2000: maybe set it out of the viewport first?
[01:40:09] <jak2000> Uhkis: http://paste.debian.net/890250/
[01:40:13] <jak2000> ee line 12
[01:40:31] <jak2000> after trigerred the event blur Xdiv_ isss vissible
[01:44:03] <systemfault> sdwrage: Any luck, I'm curious
[01:44:42] <Uhkis> jak2000: does position() work?
[01:45:39] <jak2000> interesssting: http://fiddle.jshell.net/ryantroyford/ZuZQJ/
[01:46:38] <jak2000> Uhkis i have a class named .mysscroll, under this div i have a #xdiv_0, #xdiv_1, #xdiv_2 and so on.. my quesstion is move to #xdiv_3 by ssample (Scroll)...
[01:46:52] <sdwrage> systemfault, I'm getting some other issues. I will let you know if it works
[01:46:58] <systemfault> Thanks
[02:07:52] <sdwrage> systemfault, works ;)
[02:08:02] <systemfault> Awesome

[03:54:53] <Johnson1977> what is this?
[03:54:55] <Johnson1977> a selector?
[03:55:25] <arno_bool> a div.pages creation ?

[05:13:28] <TheDude> hi to all
[05:15:13] <TheDude> is there a way to check if the browser in use is chrome or another one with jQuery?
[05:22:55] <Cork> TheDude: you can, but you REALLY shouldn't
[05:23:19] <Cork> you can check navigator.userAgent
[05:23:41] <Cork> though note browsers lie cause so many sites does bad ua sniffing
[05:24:31] <Cork> TheDude: the correct way to solve this is by doing feature detection

[05:27:09] <TheDude> mmh the fact is that I have a different behavior in different browsers, so the idea was doing a distinction on the browser
[05:28:48] <TheDude> (I don't know why but this is the only possible solution to which I'm arrived )
[05:29:20] <Cork> jquery365: what database?
[05:29:50] <Cork> TheDude: why different browsers
[05:30:02] <Cork> i could understand touch or not
[05:30:06] <Cork> but why different browsers?
[05:33:11] <TheDude> The situation is this: I have a label with inside a <small></small> text and a clickable icon <i></i>
[05:33:34] <TheDude> with firefox is all ok, they are all on same line
[05:33:39] <TheDude> with chrome not
[05:33:49] <TheDude> the icon go on the next line
[05:37:38] <jquery365> Cork: I did a database in phpmyadmin , but that may not be correct way?

[06:00:58] <aimag> Hi everyone
[06:04:41] <aimag> I have a dropdown menu with image ms-Dropdown. My problem is that I have too many images(1000) and it doesnt appear beautiful(too long list), so I wonder if there is a way to set the show of option in the dropdown as a list like in datepicker?
[07:03:41] <Ediz> Hello, I have some identical links when clicked triggers a contentLoad function that loads php files using .load. All of the links work, except one. I'm getting xhr.status 0 on that one. I can't seem to debug why. here is code in question https://jsfiddle.net/csxgcspk/
[07:04:11] <Ediz> ah, the one doesnt work is contentLoad('ads');
[07:10:45] <Rixon> Hi, I've got some table rows with week number cells on each row, so I've collected an object of { weekNumber: [ Object[tr], Object[tr], ... ], nexWeekNumber: [ ... ] }. Then I've used $.each(object, function(weekNum, $productRowsForThisWeekNum){ processDataFromRows($productRowsForThisWeekNum); }); but inside processDataFromRows($rows){ $rows.each() won't work, I keep getting "jQuery.Deferred exception: context is undefined"... how can I arrange a JQuery collect
[07:13:02] <Rixon> Ediz: onClick isn't even calling the function in that jsfiddle (at least not in firefox for me)
[07:13:58] <Ediz> Rixon, thanks, I think the problem was uBlock interfering with ad related ajax calls
[07:14:05] <Ediz> its now fixed thank you
[07:14:48] <Rixon> =)
[07:16:01] <lng> Hi! Why is not it working? I'm trying to execute jQuery code to test... Please help me
[07:16:52] <EugenA> what does .$ do?
[07:18:34] <lng> solved
[07:21:06] <Rixon> EugenA: $() is just a shortcut for JQuery()
[07:21:24] <Rixon> so $.each() is the same as JQuery.each()
[07:22:57] <EugenA> i'm trying to access the content of CKEditor with jquery..
[07:23:10] <EugenA> it seems I need to switch the context
[07:23:43] <EugenA> i need to loop all a-Tags in the CKEditor
[07:24:11] <Rixon> EugenA: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4826036/get-ckeditor-content-jquery
[07:25:08] <Rixon> EugenA, or: http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_savedata
[07:25:20] <EugenA> i can get the data of ckeditor, i don't know how to work with jquery on that data
[07:26:17] <lng> Could anybody help me to find the issue with this jQuery code please? https://jsfiddle.net/zwt696yj/18/
[07:26:29] <EugenA> how can I do $('a').each(function() {}); on the data?
[07:28:16] <Rixon> well once you have the data, if it contains HTML just wrap it in a JQuery object: var $JQWrappedCKEditorData = $(data); then you can $JQWrappedCKEditorData.find('a')....
[07:29:16] <EugenA> thanks, i'll try it
[07:32:22] <EugenA> Rixon: getting TypeError: $JQWrappedCKEditorData.find is not a function
[07:32:45] <EugenA> one sec...
[07:33:06] <EugenA> do i need really to put data into $() ?
[07:33:12] <Rixon> find is a method of the JQUery object, so your data bviously didn't get wrapped into a JQObject properly
[07:33:24] <Rixon> yes, $() returns a JQObject
[07:33:32] <Rixon> $() is the JQuery() function
[07:33:38] <Rixon> it initialises and creates collections
[07:34:13] <Rixon> you can pass DOMElement(s), strings of HTML, or even JQuery Elements to it
[07:34:43] <EugenA> got it
[07:35:08] <EugenA> thanks, it is working now as desired :-)
[07:35:11] <Rixon> =)
[07:53:38] <joaocastanho> Hi. Any way to capitalize first letter of a string?
[08:09:53] <IamTrying> http://www.babylonjs.com/Demos/SPS/ - How to make this in jQuery please?
[08:11:03] <EugenA> Rixon: one more question
[08:11:31] <EugenA> how can I get the whole html back from jQuery Object? http://pastebin.com/bhdfkSRN
[08:13:02] <Rixon> that looks correct to me, is it not working?
[08:13:34] <EugenA> I'm getting only first (!) a-Tag
[08:14:17] <Rixon> so $JQWrappedCKEditorData.prop('outerHTML') is returning just 1 <a> ?
[08:14:32] <EugenA> yes
[08:14:33] <Rixon> sounds like you overwrote $JQWrappedCKEditorData in the .each()
[08:15:01] <EugenA> but then why I'm getting first <a>? :-)
[08:15:16] <Rixon> true, it should be last =/
[08:15:32] <Rixon> have you used a return; anywhere in the .each() ?
[08:16:20] <Rixon> return has special meaning in JQuery loops like .each(): return false = break, return anything other than false = continue;
[08:17:58] <Rixon> make a new pastebin showing the code inside the each()
[08:18:12] <EugenA> http://pastebin.com/mseLdfri
[08:18:58] <Rixon> are those console.log()s only firing once for 1x<a>?
[08:19:23] <EugenA> no, 2x for each <a>
[08:20:22] <EugenA> I get really all links in the loop
[08:20:29] <Rixon> so the each loop is hitting more than just 1x<a>....
[08:20:44] <EugenA> the last console.log shows only one <a>
[08:20:48] <Rixon> hm I don't see why the $JQWrappedCKEditorData collection should be losing items
[08:21:23] <EugenA> no, I have 2 console.log in each loop
[08:21:26] <EugenA> so it is ok
[08:21:26] <Rixon> it's like .prop is being passed $JQWrappedCKEditorData.get(0).prop(...)
[08:27:55] <Rixon> EugenA, try this: $JQWrappedCKEditorData.clone().html()
[08:28:25] <Rixon> (in your console.log())
[08:37:34] <EugenA> exactly the same thing
[08:53:01] <EugenA> so, I'm loosing html http://pastebin.com/LkD5gi2P
[08:53:10] <EugenA> without any loop
[08:53:12] <EugenA> why?
[09:06:42] <EugenA> it seems that $() delete data
[09:07:01] <Rixon> maybe $() isn't getting a properly formed HTML string, try running it through .parseHTML
[09:08:20] <Rixon> var $newJQObject = $.parseHTML(editor.getData());
[09:08:57] <Rixon> I don't know for sure but I think the $() constructor should do that anyway
[09:23:58] <EugenA> Rixon: hm, how do I get html from $newJQObject?
[09:26:27] <EugenA> http://pasteboard.co/k11STKnbM.png
[09:28:39] <sigdk> can I replace document.getElementById("foobar")  with $("foobar") since I'm using jquery?
[09:35:01] <MikeD_> you don't have a foobar tag though  :p
[09:43:59] <ExoUNX> greetings
[09:45:58] <ExoUNX> I want jQuery to look for ul with the class has-group, and then apply css if it has two or li elements
[09:45:59] <ExoUNX> $('ul['has-group']:has(li, li)').addClass('class');
[09:46:04] <ExoUNX> like that?
[09:47:38] <ExoUNX> two or more*
[10:07:42] <AdamPDotty> ExoUNX: sounds like use of "if" to me
[10:10:53] <EugenA> why this? https://jsfiddle.net/f8h71pdh/
[10:11:12] <EugenA> why first <a> Tag is ok, the second one is not OK?
[10:11:25] <ExoUNX> AdamPDotty could I see an example?
[10:13:20] * hlve slaps AdamPDotty with a trout.
[10:13:30] <AdamPDotty> I hope, that one is fresh.
[10:13:55] <ExoUNX> I was thinking something like this
[10:14:00] <ExoUNX> $('ul:has(li, li)').hasClass(has-group).addClass('mutiple');
[10:14:22] <ExoUNX> $('ul:has(li, li)').hasClass('has-group').addClass('mutiple');
[10:14:41] <AdamPDotty>  $('ul.has-group').each(function(){if (this.length>1) $(this).addClass('className');});
[10:15:28] <AdamPDotty> not quite right yet
[10:16:13] <AdamPDotty>  $('ul.has-group').each(function(){var that = $(this); if (that.children().length>1) that.addClass('className');});
[10:17:09] <ExoUNX> and is it possible to addClass to another element other than the ul?
[10:17:21] <ExoUNX> I would assume so
[10:17:34] <AdamPDotty> sure
[10:19:10] <ExoUNX> that.('div.class').addClass() ?
[10:19:49] <AdamPDotty> probably that.find('div.class').addClass()
[10:20:21] <AdamPDotty> unless you want to create something there
[10:23:42] <AdamPDotty> Still should not be necessary, in most cases its more sensible to adjust CSS properties: .newClassName div.class {color: red;}
[10:25:23] <ExoUNX> I have $('ul.has-group').each(function(){var that = $(this); if (that.children().length>1) that.find('div.ms-section').addClass('ms-multiple');});
[10:37:41] <danemacmillan> I'm manually "trigger()"ing a custom event on, say, a dom node that is nested five layers deep, and I'm passing it as $('#fivelayersdeep').trigger('customEvent'). Shouldn't that event bubble up those five layers, so that I could listen for that custom event on, say, $('#parentOfFiveLayersDeep').on('customEvent', callback)?
[10:38:12] <danemacmillan> I'm not seeing any bubbling whatsoever.
[10:40:58] <AdamPDotty> maybe try with a standard event first, but yes, should bubble up
[10:51:20] <ExoUNX> does that js need to be below the actual html for it work?
[10:51:31] <ExoUNX> for it to work*
[10:56:18] <ExoUNX> I put it below just incase, doesn't seem to be working
[10:56:22] <ExoUNX> should I have that.find though?
[10:56:28] <ExoUNX> should it just be find()
[11:02:31] <Rixon> ExoUNX: find() is not a normal function, it's a method of $() JQuery Objects, which you have created from 'this' as 'that = $(this)', so that.find() is correct
[11:03:40] <Rixon> i usually name variables containing JQuery objects beginning with '$' so I know that '$someVariable' contains $(something)
[11:04:06] <Rixon> (also known as 'hungarian notation' - denote the type in the name
[11:09:05] <ExoUNX> https://jsfiddle.net/43pypevc/
[11:09:15] <ExoUNX> I'm stupid lol
[11:09:21] <ExoUNX> I don't have jQuery loaded in there
[11:10:04] <ExoUNX> there we go
[11:10:04] <ExoUNX> https://jsfiddle.net/43pypevc/1/
[11:14:20] <choosegoose> is it bad practice to use $.ajax's beforeSend setting for things unrelated to the jqXHR, like logging, showing a loading overlay etc
[11:15:02] <choosegoose> or can you just put whatever you want in there that you'd otherwise put above the $.ajax() call
[11:19:18] <ExoUNX> Rixon AdamPDotty https://jsfiddle.net/43pypevc/2/
[11:19:23] <AdamPDotty> loading overlay sounds sensible there
[11:21:44] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/43pypevc/4/
[11:27:57] <ExoUNX> AdamPDotty thank you, how would I accomplish this? https://jsfiddle.net/44L3pdhk/2/
[11:28:24] <ExoUNX> it's interesting learning these jQuery functions too
[11:29:39] <ExoUNX> got it I think :D
[11:29:46] <ExoUNX> did span, ul.has.group

[13:48:33] <hellyeah> yo
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[13:52:33] <hellyeah> good evening :D
[14:07:35] <lukas__> Can anyone help me? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fab532de306cfbc64bdaebe57267130a
[14:08:14] <robertmaxrees> what about it "does not work"?
[14:08:31] <taplar> how can you load to something your removing dude
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:08:41] <robertmaxrees> i was headed there.
[14:08:49] <taplar> sorry
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> you're removing the body and then trying to append something to it.
[14:09:12] <robertmaxrees> though this is kind of a bad idea in the first place, but (shrug)
[14:09:31] <patricks> hello dear friendly online neighbors
[14:09:56] <taplar> lukas__: also unless your doing the bindings again some where, after you replace the entire body, all those bindings are going to be gone
[14:12:01] <lukas__> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ad59604e97b24ad17fa413f40c6b24c7 whats with this?
[14:12:15] <patricks> I have two divs left to right, centered using a wrapper with text-align:middle. This works nicely. But with jQuery I am fading out both at the same time. However, one is almost always a bit faster than the other and you can see how one block disappears while the other still fades out and *jumps* to the middle of the wrapper before completely fading out. How can I avoid this "race condition"?
[14:12:44] <taplar> lukas__:  you have to describe your problem more man.  not just show code and say "wtf?"
[14:13:11] <taplar> can't speak for others, but i'm not a mind reader
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> patricks make a jsfiddle :)
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> lukas__ what about it?
[14:16:19] <lukas__> ahahah :D When I click on #about the content in body hide and an other html file loads in the body. But when I click on #home nothing happens. Thats my problem. (Sorry for my bad english.)
[14:16:31] <taplar> your replacing the entire body
[14:16:39] <taplar> your binding are gone, as i mentioned above
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:17:05] <robertmaxrees> lukas__ why are you doing this in the first place?
[14:18:35] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[14:18:47] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:20:09] <hlve> trout-day.
[14:20:16] <hlve> i declare today, trout day.
[14:20:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[14:20:37] <hlve> >:/
[14:20:45] <hlve> i gotta go find my phone
[14:20:52] <hlve> idk where it went ::|
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> android or iphone?
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> 'cause they both have tools to help you find it.
[14:21:12] <robertmaxrees> android even lets you ring it.
[14:22:22] * taplar twiddles fingers
[14:23:32] * taplar is experiencing npm for the first time
[14:24:24] <lukas__> the code form the loaded html file does not interact with javascript ...
[14:25:15] <taplar> right...
[14:25:36] <taplar> you understand that your binding on 'elements', right?
[14:25:46] <taplar> elements that are in the DOM
[14:25:54] <taplar> if you remove those elements, those bindings are gone
[14:26:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:26] <taplar> $(selector) finds elements, -at that point in time-, in the DOM that match
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> right, and it doesn't update as the page changes.
[14:37:13] <taplar> we left him speachless
[14:37:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:20:21] <abakedapplepie> anyone know of any plugins that handle picking a time range? like this but free : http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/timepicker/rangeselection
[15:20:52] <robertmaxrees> you could build something like that out pretty easily.
[15:21:58] <abakedapplepie> unfortunately im not an expert at js and was hoping to find something off the shelf
[15:22:09] <robertmaxrees> doesn't require you to be an expert at JS :)
[15:22:21] <abakedapplepie> for now im using another generic timepicker but i would like to limit the "end" time selector to begin at the time the "start" selector is set at
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> which timepicker are you using?
[15:22:37] <taplar> there's a reason that plugin is not free.  hard to find things exactly like you want them off the shelf, ;)
[15:22:39] <robertmaxrees> maybe it has options for that.
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> also that.
[15:23:03] <abakedapplepie> yeah i just figured what im asking for is pretty generic so no sense in reinventing the wheel
[15:23:05] <taplar> gotta get your toes wet to some degree
[15:23:15] <abakedapplepie> i also found a solution using a slider but it didnt appear to be mobile friendly
[15:23:32] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[15:23:34] <abakedapplepie> taplar i agree but unfortunately im not paid to learn :|
[15:23:42] <robertmaxrees> then you need a new employer.
[15:23:46] <robertmaxrees> what a hostile environment.
[15:23:47] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:23:58] <robertmaxrees> either way, sliders can be plenty mobile friendly, just need to make the handles 40x40
[15:24:00] <abakedapplepie> but anyway currently im using http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker/
[15:24:05] <taplar> you're paid to provide results.  part of that is learning those results, :)
[15:24:19] <abakedapplepie> taplar: billable hour metrics argue otherwise :/
[15:24:27] <abakedapplepie> i wish i twasnt the case
[15:24:32] <robertmaxrees> are you a contractor?
[15:24:36] <taplar> ah, ^
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> a;sp" DisableTimeRanges Example
[15:24:45] <robertmaxrees> exactly what you're looking for.
[15:25:04] <abakedapplepie> no i work for an MSP actually
[15:25:09] <abakedapplepie> so web dev is not my primary focus
[15:25:31] <abakedapplepie> but ive been a hobbyist web dev for about 14 years
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> i hear this all too often.  non-devs being asked to do dev work but not really getting paid for it.
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> frustrating.
[15:25:54] <abakedapplepie> yeah, tell me about it
[15:25:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, the plugin you're using has an option for what you're looking to do.
[15:25:59] <abakedapplepie> theres also 0 project management
[15:27:21] <abakedapplepie> robertmaxrees i know its as simple as updating the end_date disabletimerange parameters when the start_date is set but i dont know how to actually do it :P
[15:27:35] <robertmaxrees> the example shows you actually how to do it though...
[15:27:59] <abakedapplepie> the example shows disabling a static list of times
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> you could just as easily pass vars.
[15:28:20] <robertmaxrees> and define those times elsewhere.
[15:48:00] <Mark__> Hi, need help with a problem that I am experiencing. I am trying to log into web page and with my current Win 7 64x it does not let me to do it. Tried with XP, 98 and some Linux OS and it does work. I have some stats, screen shots etc... Looking for some help. Thx
[15:48:51] <robertmaxrees> Mark__ wrong channel?
[15:49:15] <Mark__> ops sorry
[15:49:43] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[15:49:44] <Mark__> they said my problem is due to a jQuery problem
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> who is "they"?
[15:50:01] <robertmaxrees> and did you write the code?
[15:50:21] <Mark__> the guys that provide the technical service for the web page that
[15:50:28] <Mark__> iI am trying to log in
[15:50:37] <robertmaxrees> okay let's back waaaaaaayyyyy up :)
[15:50:42] <Mark__> and nope, I am the poor guy that tries to resolve the problem
[15:50:51] <robertmaxrees> heh, so you're not a programmer?
[15:51:06] <robertmaxrees> i mean, we can try to help fix it.
[15:51:27] <Mark__> nope, just an end user that can't get enough tech support from www.backtrackdtour.com guys :(
[15:51:42] <taplar> not sure how you're supossed to fix their site issue...
[15:51:46] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:51:51] <robertmaxrees> you can't fix their code.
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> their development team needs to do that
[15:52:22] <taplar> that's like finding a bug in excel and being told you gotta fix it.
[15:52:37] <taplar> fk no, i'll just go with OO, :D
[15:52:49] <Mark__> Apparently nothing is wrong with their web site. There is a problem with my OS (Win 7 64x)  that thing that the jQuery is a thread and prevents it from running :(
[15:52:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> that makes no sense.
[15:54:15] <Mark__> Yeah, it doesn't. They asked me to seek help from this channel and see if I could get help
[15:54:20] <taplar> lol
[15:54:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:54:34] <robertmaxrees> was there an email or something that said this?
[15:54:45] <taplar> cancel your service, and go find one of their competitors, imho
[15:54:57] <taplar> -_-
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar it looks like it's for a GPS or something.
[15:55:28] <Mark__> Nope, on the phone they told me that my problem is (after some forward, backward ,trouble shooting etc..) in regards to jQuery and I checked the web site saw this channel for support
[15:55:30] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really have anb option.
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> so the guy on the phone told you it's your problem?
[15:55:50] <taplar> i'm sure there are other GPS things out there.
[15:56:04] <Mark__> yes, it is an GPS, that tracks your route and then this web site shows which track you took
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> Mark__ show us where the issue is?
[15:56:34] <taplar> also you've stated multiple times your OS, but what browser?
[15:56:46] <Mark__> well, thx for the time... I do go to www.backtrackdtour.com put my login and password
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ give us some info and we can go from there.
[15:57:05] <taplar> and have you tried other browsers?
[15:59:20] <Mark__> just prepairing a screen shot
[16:00:30] <Mark__> https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrgx25lleyxev9k/Capture.JPG?dl=0
[16:00:43] <Mark__> yes and I tried chrome, opera, IE, firefox
[16:00:58] <Mark__> none of these browser to open up this page
[16:01:03] <robertmaxrees> okay so back way up.
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> see that error code?
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> 403?
[16:01:21] <Mark__> I meant lets me to sing in, but once I change the operating system and use different OS yes, it works
[16:01:27] <Mark__> yes 403
[16:01:49] <robertmaxrees> is that after you submit the form?
[16:01:57] <Mark__> yes after submiting the form
[16:02:11] <robertmaxrees> yeha, that's expected.  that means you entered the wrong uname/pass
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'd assume that's expected.  i get that, too.
[16:02:39] <Mark__> but the same user/password works with different browsers on a different OS such as linux, win 98, win xp
[16:03:05] <taplar> just to make absolutely sure, have you typed them into like a notepad and copied and pasted them into the fields?
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> okay, well that error has nothing to do with jquery.
[16:04:43] <Mark__> yes absulutly correct. Tried it again. And it does log in from my tablet (Samsung) and same ISP
[16:04:57] <robertmaxrees> so here's the lowdown
[16:05:08] <robertmaxrees> that error only means you're not authenticated - the issue has nothing to to with jquery.
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> that's just a failed network request.  so their phone support guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[16:05:47] <Mark__> hmmm. here is before and after hitting the submit https://www.dropbox.com/s/nvscl4euphw2ou5/Before%20submiting%20the%20form.JPG?dl=0
[16:06:00] <robertmaxrees> right
[16:06:06] <robertmaxrees> so that screen is just network requests.
[16:06:09] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with code.
[16:06:19] <hlve> mmmmm
[16:06:22] <hlve> MochaChino
[16:06:23] * hlve sips
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> there should be a "console" tab - see it?
[16:06:51] <Mark__> I uninstalled the Anti Virus, disabeled the firewall. flushed the DNS
[16:07:12] <Mark__> yes console
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> okay, reload the page and try logging in again.
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> and type your password into notepad and then copy into the field to make triple sure it's right.
[16:08:48] <Mark__> yep, still does the same.... Console screen shot => https://www.dropbox.com/s/jsu0ml6bgcq6o4y/Console-Capture.JPG?dl=0
[16:09:07] <robertmaxrees> heh, same error, too.
[16:09:09] <robertmaxrees> sorry, man.
[16:09:15] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing we can do from here.
[16:09:44] <Mark__> I understand
[16:09:49] <robertmaxrees> something is broken on their side.  they're more than welcome to ask for support here themselves, but there's not really much you can do from your end, at least w/r/t jquery
[16:10:38] <Mark__> so this is not releted to my OS or browser eh? More something related at their end?
[16:10:52] <robertmaxrees> maybe it is.
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> hard for us to know :) but i don't buy that the issue is with jquery itself.  that seems awfully strange.  what browser are youusing?
[16:11:27] <robertmaxrees> chrome?
[16:11:40] <Mark__> Chrome, IE, Opera
[16:11:55] <robertmaxrees> so every browser on that machine doesn't work?
[16:12:19] <Mark__> nope, non of the browser on this macine works. Tablet work, linux on a VM works, 98 and XP on a VM works
[16:12:37] <robertmaxrees> then maybe you have a configuration issue with that machine.
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> i might go to #web and ask them for help.
[16:13:01] <Mark__> #web is a channel ?
[16:13:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> more generic than here.
[16:14:11] <Mark__> ok thx for the assistance though. is there a command that can be typed that takes me there?
[16:14:17] <Mark__> switching channels?
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> sure - /join #web will take you there.
[16:17:32] <Mark__> thx you all. much appreciated your time!
[16:18:48] <taplar> us marks can't catch a break i tell ya
[16:19:35] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:58:16] * taplar can relax a bit more
[16:58:40] <taplar> i love expected broken tests, :)
[23:45:32] <snufft> I know this is a very very short snippet, but does anyone knowany reason why IE would throw a syntax error on the "=>" in this: post_code = data.results[0].address_components.filter(c => c.types[0] === 'postal_code')[0].short_name;
[23:46:22] <snufft> just on the offchance someone answered that in the 2 seconds that i was away, a copy/paste would be greatly appreciated :P haha
