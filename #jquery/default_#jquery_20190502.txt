[00:47:38] <sydbarret> anybody has worked with datatables?
[00:48:51] <sydbarret> based on a jinja variable i need to hidde some datatable buttons
[00:48:58] <sydbarret> or how i have 2 datatable calls, one with all the features and one without
[00:52:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:52:17] <robertmaxrees> i like how i gave you an answer about how you'd start that and then you just kinda bailed on the convo.
[00:52:20] <robertmaxrees> v v cool
[00:53:00] <sydbarret> robert you never help
[00:53:07] <sydbarret> you are useless here
[00:53:12] <sydbarret> your help is to vague
[00:53:13] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[00:53:17] <sydbarret> put sample
[00:53:22] <robertmaxrees> i already told you.
[00:53:31] <robertmaxrees> make a global object that holds that info.
[00:53:34] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[00:53:35] <sydbarret> without a sample is difficult
[00:53:45] <robertmaxrees> so you expect people to do it for you?
[00:53:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[00:53:56] <sydbarret> no, but you can provide sample
[00:53:59] <robertmaxrees> window.myGlobalData = {};
[00:54:00] <sydbarret> or link to sample
[00:54:17] <sydbarret> and what goes inside the brakets
[00:54:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ there's a global object.  dunno how you'd make jinja print out the json but that would go where the brackets are
[00:54:38] <sydbarret> let me show you what someone else put
[00:54:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:54:50] <sydbarret> just use python if and have 2 datatable calls, one with all the features and one without
[00:54:57] <robertmaxrees> then do that?
[00:54:59] <sydbarret> do you understand what he meant?
[00:55:09] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that's another way.
[00:55:29] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're tackling learning both python and js without really understanding the separation between the two.
[00:56:08] <sydbarret> how would you do what he said though
[00:56:14] <sydbarret> i have  $(document).ready(function() {  const cust_det = $('table.datatable').DataTable(
[00:56:22] <sydbarret> below the template
[00:56:23] <robertmaxrees> you could probably pop a conditional in the template that determines what html to render.
[00:56:43] <sydbarret> i have jinja varaible for it
[00:56:48] <robertmaxrees> or however that works.
[00:56:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't really know jinja so :shrug:
[00:57:00] <sydbarret>  {% if not paid %}
[00:57:03] <robertmaxrees> and i'm useless so you don't care anyway ;)
[00:57:25] <sydbarret> let me research this crap window.myGlobalData
[00:57:36] <robertmaxrees> "Crap"
[00:57:42] <robertmaxrees> your attitude is all wrong.
[00:57:48] <robertmaxrees> that's just how you explicitly declare a global var.
[00:57:57] <robertmaxrees> you actually care about how you'd render out the JSON
[00:58:37] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret ^
[00:58:59] <sydbarret> i search for "window.myGlobalData" and almost no result
[00:59:07] <robertmaxrees> did you read what i just said?
[00:59:15] <robertmaxrees> that's just how you explicitly declare a global variable.
[00:59:51] <sydbarret> you wan i have to assign all the table to that variable?
[01:00:05] <sydbarret> all the tag table?
[01:00:08] <robertmaxrees> window.myGlobalData = {% some jinja thing that prints out the json object of stuff you want to be available to the in-page JS %}
[01:01:01] <sydbarret> the jinja thing is a html table which has jquery below template
[01:01:08] <robertmaxrees> window.myGlobalData = { customer: { isPaid: {% jinja stuff for true or false %} } };
[01:01:29] <robertmaxrees> isn't jinja all server-side?
[01:01:45] <robertmaxrees> which means it runs before anything is sent to the client.
[01:01:53] <sydbarret> yes i can recover the value of variable
[01:02:00] <sydbarret> i just need to play with the datatable
[01:02:12] <sydbarret> based on variable true/false variable
[01:02:15] <robertmaxrees> so one more time.
[01:02:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to expose that data to the js in a way it can understand.
[01:02:50] <robertmaxrees> so solve that problem using the example (that you asked for) above.
[01:03:04] <sydbarret> i tried this https://quickpaste.net/108ef21798aa7a45142c03f2bdb382cf
[01:03:11] <sydbarret> inside js
[01:03:14] <sydbarret> but doesnt work
[01:03:28] <robertmaxrees> do you want to change the className on a button?
[01:04:14] <sydbarret> i wanna hide the button by changing his class based on jinja variable
[01:04:30] <sydbarret> you know datatables right?
[01:04:32] <robertmaxrees> so what happens when you use your thing?
[01:04:42] <sydbarret> nothing happens
[01:04:47] <robertmaxrees> does the button have a class="something else" ?
[01:05:02] <robertmaxrees> what does the rendered js look like?
[01:05:19] <robertmaxrees> you realize that the js and jinja have nothing to do with each other, right?
[01:05:26] <sydbarret> class is  className: 'btn-sm btn-success btn-hide-disabled buttonsToHide',
[01:05:40] <robertmaxrees> then your jinja template is bad
[01:05:46] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[01:06:47] <sydbarret> is not bad  it captures the right value of var
[01:06:56] <sydbarret> i have a very similar stuff than this https://datatables.net/extensions/select/examples/initialisation/buttons.html
[01:07:11] <robertmaxrees> > asks multiple questions
[01:07:15] <robertmaxrees> > doesn't get answers
[01:07:19] <robertmaxrees> > gets insulted
[01:07:38] <robertmaxrees> being overly aggressive and unresponsive to basic questions isn't gonna get you far :)
[01:07:54] <sydbarret> im replying to you that jinja is fine
[01:08:02] <robertmaxrees> so what's your rendered js?
[01:08:21] <sydbarret> what is a rendered js?
[01:08:25] <sydbarret> see the link
[01:08:29] <sydbarret> thats what gets rendered
[01:08:31] <robertmaxrees> the javascript hat's actually getting sent to the browser.
[01:08:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[01:08:39] <robertmaxrees> that's the datatables documentation
[01:08:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not what's coming out of your server
[01:09:06] <sydbarret> you mean the template?
[01:09:13] <robertmaxrees> i mean the output from your server
[01:09:15] <robertmaxrees> not the jinja
[01:09:30] <robertmaxrees> the stuff when you view the page source in your browser.
[01:09:36] <robertmaxrees> that's the only thing that jquery can see.
[01:10:51] <sydbarret> you mean regarding my previous sample of "something else" in the class?
[01:11:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.  what is actually getting sent to the browser?
[01:12:55] <sydbarret> how so i see that?
[01:13:08] <sydbarret> hitting inspect in the browser?
[01:13:28] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[01:13:44] <robertmaxrees> or, as i said a few lines up, "the stuff when you view the page source in your browser."
[01:14:16] <Betal> hello, how to get the div reference based on the childs arguments? https://jsfiddle.net/Lpvf1tkg/
[01:14:44] <robertmaxrees> Betal mind rephrasing that question?
[01:15:03] <robertmaxrees> and use better names than "a, b, c" for those args :)
[01:15:06] <sydbarret> it works
[01:15:09] <Betal> it is example
[01:15:11] <sydbarret> its working
[01:15:23] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret what's working??  your probnlem is solved??
[01:15:33] <robertmaxrees> Betal so what exactly are you looking for then??
[01:15:38] <sydbarret> it seems that now its switching classes yes
[01:15:49] <sydbarret> now how can i hidde a button through class?
[01:15:49] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret lmao alright.
[01:15:51] <robertmaxrees> gg :)
[01:15:54] <robertmaxrees> css
[01:15:56] <Betal> robertmaxrees: how to get the div that contains the img a3 and b3
[01:16:06] <Betal> but dont contains the c image
[01:16:09] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret make a generic .hide class
[01:16:51] <Betal> robertmaxrees: maybe this is better, https://jsfiddle.net/Lpvf1tkg/1/
[01:17:02] <robertmaxrees> Betal this code is... strange lol.  so you want a function that returns any div that only contains the images you specify?
[01:17:07] <Betal> how to get the div that have 'a' and 'b', but don't have c
[01:17:18] <Betal> thats why I passed null on line 15
[01:17:20] <robertmaxrees> Betal that's not any better lmfao
[01:17:28] <robertmaxrees> your code is making this too hard Betal
[01:17:35] <Betal> it is better for the real case usage
[01:17:45] <robertmaxrees> then show me the "real case"
[01:17:59] <robertmaxrees> because really what you want is an array of strings.
[01:18:24] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees like this? .buttonsToHide { visible: false }  ?
[01:18:36] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret i'd use display: none
[01:18:46] <robertmaxrees> and just .hide { display: none; } in your css.
[01:19:12] <robertmaxrees> but keep in mind - users can very easily open their dev tools and remove that class from the html.
[01:19:25] <robertmaxrees> so i'd prevent the buttons from rendering whatsoever.
[01:21:30] * robertmaxrees cues the jeopardy music
[01:23:43] <robertmaxrees> Betal can you explain why you need something like this?
[01:25:11] <Betal> robertmaxrees: it is just the final part of the thingy I was doing the other day
[01:25:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:26:09] <robertmaxrees> i love these vague answers lately.  you've got, what, almost 15 years of industry experience at your fingertips, and your answer is "i'm just doing a thing"
[01:26:46] <Betal> haha
[01:27:09] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i'm serious.
[01:30:05] <Betal> robertmaxrees: I have a lot of divs, every have some img inside, the point is, knowing the combination of images, get the correct div
[01:30:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a werid thing to need, but ok.
[01:30:29] <robertmaxrees> are you in control of the html at all?
[01:30:47] <Betal> the day that instead of building a browser plugin we use the console, lol
[01:30:58] <Betal> no, the html is fixed
[01:31:06] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[01:31:06] <Betal> well, what you mean control of?
[01:31:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean do you control the server that's rendering the html at all.
[01:31:21] <Betal> no
[01:31:33] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[01:31:35] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[01:31:58] <Betal> is the div:not expression correct?
[01:33:09] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea - selectors like that are really weird.  i'd favor passing in an array of classnames, then have your function compare all child image classnames against the array you pass it.
[01:34:11] <robertmaxrees> hell, an easy test is to test the length of the .find('img') selector
[01:40:30] <robertmaxrees> (also, Betal, no - those selectors aren't valid. check your dev tools.)
[01:49:00] <Betal> robertmaxrees: something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/Lpvf1tkg/2/
[01:51:22] <robertmaxrees> why does everybody insist on using selectors for everything?
[01:52:06] <Betal> inexperience, lol
[01:52:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ef4rjkpz/3/
[01:53:02] <robertmaxrees> stop workin' so hard.
[01:53:44] <robertmaxrees> and avoid stuffing your selectors with so much crap.
[01:54:14] <robertmaxrees> learn about jquery's .filter() - also check out the native js array methods like map, every, and some.
[01:58:07] <Betal> robertmaxrees: but in this case how I will get the div wrapper that dont have the img c?
[02:03:54] <robertmaxrees> i like how i make suggestions on things to learn and then they get completely ignored.
[02:17:57] <Cork> heh robertmaxrees a bit cranky to day? :D
[02:18:48] <robertmaxrees> a smidge ;) pretty over the support vampires at this point
[02:19:56] <Cork> ya, ppl that ask questions to promptly ignore the answers are hard to deal with
[02:20:34] <robertmaxrees> or people who get snarky because they're challenged to actually work through things themselves.
[02:20:48] <Cork> true
[02:20:51] <robertmaxrees> *gasp* how dare we challenge people to learn?!
[02:21:15] <robertmaxrees> next you'll tell me it's possible to write code using my dev tools and without "examples"
[02:21:37] <Cork> no copy paste?
[02:21:46] <Cork> the thought to use more then v and c...
[02:21:52] <robertmaxrees> isn't that programming????
[02:22:19] <Cork> ya, been there seen that
[02:22:23] <robertmaxrees> makes me nostalgaic for the days where the worst was people coming in and starting with a single "guys"
[02:22:56] <Cork> or come in and pasting a link asking "why doesn't this page work"
[02:23:05] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[02:23:15] <Cork> and it is a page with about 4 examples pasted after eachother
[02:23:20] <robertmaxrees> "i work on this for many day y don't it work"
[02:23:23] <Cork> the variable names aren't even aligned
[02:23:28] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[02:24:11] <robertmaxrees> too real.
[02:27:06] <robertmaxrees> this convo got me thinking about billcriswell
[02:27:13] <robertmaxrees> miss that dude.
[02:29:26] <Cork> ya
[02:33:55] <TeddyMurray> Hi
[02:44:01] <shoky> are you here to offer computer hacking lessons
[02:45:09] <TeddyMurray> Shaki how did you hear about my computer hacking lessons and I would be more than happy to offer you some
[02:45:24] <shoky> lol
[02:45:39] <shoky> i am in #Node.js too..
[02:45:56] <TeddyMurray> I kind of spam the message all over the Internet so I was kind of creeped out I thought maybe you were on my Facebook
[02:46:19] <shoky> and i'll go with ljharb's answer:  <ljharb> no thanks, i've seen movies so i'm a hacker
[02:46:20] <TeddyMurray> What areas are you good in computer hacking if you're going by the OSI model
[02:46:45] <shoky> please stop spamming all over the internet, thx
[02:47:10] <TeddyMurray> Shoky apparently you do not know who I am and I will forgive you for that but I am offering computer hacking lessons including 0 days
[02:47:45] <shoky> i'm not really sorry about it so there is nothing to forgive, but thanks. please go away elsewhere
[02:48:14] <TeddyMurray> I can give you jQuery lessons to I'm a beast at that even though it's about to be deprecated
[02:48:28] <TeddyMurray> It's all about that react JS and angularjs now and you know what it's everyone's internet you go away
[02:48:30] <shoky> i'm sure you can.
[02:48:38] * Cork wonders why shoky awoke the bear that was sleeping...
[02:49:02] <shoky> it was getting quiet in here
[02:49:29] <TeddyMurray> The only thing I don't like about jQuery is the spaghetti code and the lack of data binding
[02:49:36] <TeddyMurray> However I love the Callback functions
[04:07:57] <MACscr> i will create a fiddle if needed, but on() should work to dynamic elements, right? I have a ajax post that display some results and part of that result is a button. Trying to do a click event on that button. im doing something like $('#list_creator_form .go_back').on('click', function() { .... }
[04:08:18] <Cork> MACscr: no, not unless you use the delegate syntax
[04:08:33] <Cork> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[04:11:47] <MACscr> hmm, not sure i follow completely
[04:12:42] <Cork> MACscr: $('selector').on('event', func) means: $() searches for elements matching the selector when this line runs
[04:12:56] <Cork> it builds an array of the found elements and it is then given to .on
[04:13:12] <Cork> on then loops the array and binds 'event' listners to those elements
[04:13:30] <Cork> so, if the element doesn't exist or are later replaced you have problem
[04:13:38] <Cork> so you need the delegate syntax
[04:14:56] <MACscr> Cork that makes more sense. thanks!
[04:15:12] <MACscr> i really appreciate the explanation and useful example
[09:57:17] <TeddyMurray> Hi
[13:03:40] <TeddyMurray> Hi
[13:17:40] <thykka> hi
[14:27:02] <yolan> Hello
[14:27:03] <yolan> https://bpaste.net/show/7e934f18626d
[14:27:31] <yolan> I get something weird with this
[14:27:32] <yolan> TypeError: b.ownerDocument is undefined
[14:27:43] <yolan> InvalidValueError: not an instance of HTMLInputElement
[14:27:54] <yolan> Is something wrong with my code?
[14:28:08] <yolan> I tried to write clean code :)
[15:11:12] <robertmaxrees> yolan head over to ##javascript :)
[15:11:57] <yolan> robertmaxrees, I'm there, it's not of much help unfortunatly
[15:12:05] <yolan> they are deep into a conversation around debugging lol
[15:12:15] <robertmaxrees> what link does it say the issue is on?
[15:12:18] <robertmaxrees> *line
[15:12:26] <yolan> into framework apparently
[15:12:28] <yolan> other files
[15:12:37] <robertmaxrees> so not jquery :)
[15:12:38] <yolan> But the problem comes from the forEach loop
[15:12:48] <yolan> robertmaxrees, I only use Jquery
[15:12:55] <yolan> and yes I know sorry
[15:12:56] <robertmaxrees> the issue is not with jquery sadly.
[15:12:57] <robertmaxrees> :(
[15:13:06] <yolan> Yes, it's pure javascript
[15:13:15] <yolan> sorry I don't want to pollute your channel
[15:13:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry duder.  you'll have more luck in ##javascript.
[15:13:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:13:21] <yolan> o/
[15:13:24] <yolan> no problem
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.  just trying to not waste your time
[15:16:55] <shoky> yolan: one major issue with your code is in line 56, you are calling initialize() in that line, passing its return value to .addDomListener() which isn't what you intended probably
[15:19:18] <shoky> also it's pretty weird/wrong that you're adding multiple handlers for the same window load event
[15:22:36] <shoky> yolan: also, on line 64 you are passing a jquery object to google.maps.places.Autocomplete() - i doubt it accepts jquery objects
[16:47:30] <tona> hello everyone
[16:48:09] <tona> how could i create one submenu for 1 using expand and collapse , I can not make one submenu under 1 , http://jsfiddle.net/hungerpain/eK8X5/7/
[16:48:23] <tona> sorry this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/2oumszp4/
[16:48:38] <tona> I am wondering if someone could guide me , how to create one submenu for 1
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> first off you need to fix your html;
[16:49:12] <robertmaxrees> can't have a div as a direct child of a <ul>
[16:49:52] <tona> then how should it go ?
[16:50:14] <robertmaxrees> needs to be an LI
[17:17:58] <tona> @robertmaxrees  do you have one example how to create one table with submenus for example 1,-> 1.1 , 1.2, 1.3   2->, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3    3->  3.1, 3.2, 3.3
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use tables for that.
[17:19:49] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were using uls for this?
[17:20:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g9wkh52t/
[17:20:32] <robertmaxrees> just start here :|
[17:20:36] <tona> ok
[17:21:29] <tona> thanks
[17:22:15] <robertmaxrees> just had to fix the html, duder ;)
[22:00:18] <qiller> hi guys, please how can i set  dynamically var val = 'test'; and use inside parse JSON.parse(result).val.timestamp; val = 'test' are not recognized
[22:04:23] <pavonia> You want to replace the value of a certain key in a JSON string?
[22:05:28] <qiller> pavonia: yes
[22:05:41] <qiller> JSON.parse(result).val.timestamp and val = variable
[22:07:05] <pavonia> The parsed result is an JS object, so setting the value should work by accessing the indiviual fields
[22:07:41] <pavonia> JSON.parse(result)[val].timestamp = ... or something like that
[22:08:01] <qiller> pavonia: i cant use [val], Unexpected token =\
[22:08:48] <qiller> lol, its work fine pavonia thank you.  (result)[val] instead of (result).[val]
[22:09:13] <qiller> pavonia: have a nice day <3
[22:09:20] <pavonia> Yeah, simple object field accessor
