[00:00:39] <madprops> is there an inverse to $(element) .. like to ensure to get element[0] when necessary?
[00:01:41] <madprops> i guess i can just $()[0] every time
[00:16:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:17:07] <robertmaxrees> you mean always get the first element?
[00:17:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .eq(0) or .first()
[00:17:48] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question why you're relying on the implicit DOM order in that case.
[01:04:09] <madprops> robertmaxrees, no i mean, get the native html element
[01:04:29] <madprops> that's a problem with jquery, have to be sure what kind of element im dealing with
[01:04:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:04:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're misusing classes to me :)
[01:47:46] <coolternet> hello guys
[01:48:00] <coolternet> im trying to make an AJAX code for my website
[01:48:34] <coolternet> when im clicking on my menu, my page refresh and my other page not load the main header html
[01:49:12] <coolternet> this is my code
[01:49:13] <coolternet> https://fkcd.ca/1Wk
[01:50:01] <Cork> coolternet: does the url point to a partial or a full page?
[01:50:16] <Cork> cause if it is the later you can't avoid loading everything
[01:50:35] <Cork> you can choose to filter out parts you don't want later though (though it is messy to do so)
[01:59:02] <coolternet> partial like all normal page point
[01:59:17] <coolternet> like ?p=eshop/page
[06:07:07] <tokla> im getting empty on PHP whenever I do print_r($_POST) using console.log($(".login-form").serialize())             let post = $.post("php/Login.php", $(".login-form").serialize(), function(data) {                 console.log(data)
[06:08:04] <Cork> tokla: check what serialize() returns
[06:08:30] <tokla> Cork: i do console.log($(".login-form").serialize())  this returns it with the values but php side shows empty
[06:09:02] <Cork> tokla: then it most likely is your server doing something wrong
[06:09:17] <Cork> but you can start by checking the browsers network log and see what it actaully posts
[06:09:33] <Cork> if the data is there, then you can stop looking at the js end
[06:10:14] <tokla> Cork: the header send it also with the values
[06:10:30] <Cork> header what?
[06:10:38] <Cork> check the data sent
[06:10:44] <tokla> Cork: in Network > Login.php
[06:11:10] <tokla> Cork: in Network > Login.php > FormData section
[06:11:23] <Cork> ok, then check your server
[06:11:32] <Cork> cause the error isn't client side
[06:11:57] <Cork> i would be careful with using relative urls though
[06:12:27] <Cork> my spine irks every time i see them (cause they are easy to break as they change depending on what page url you are currently on)
[06:12:49] <tokla> Cork: but i do print_r($_POST); in the first line so how does it convert it to empty ?
[06:13:12] <Cork> tokla: you would have to look at your server logs
[06:13:25] <Cork> you might hit a apache rewrite or what ever
[06:13:46] <thykka> what's the HTTP status on that request? 200?
[06:14:23] <tokla> thykka: yep status code is 200
[14:22:36] <royalty> i'm running into something silly
[14:22:54] <royalty> let's say with ajax i append an element to another on success
[14:23:05] <robertmaxrees> alright
[14:23:29] <royalty> using $.ajax().then( $someelement.append(data.returnHtml); } in returnHtml I have an element with an id
[14:23:47] <royalty> my success function is more like
[14:24:45] <royalty> if ($elementwithId.length) { $elementWithId.replaceWith(returndata); } else { $someelement.append(returndata); }
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> ok.  so what's the issue?
[14:25:07] <royalty> it can't find elementWithId
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> "can't find" how?
[14:25:23] <royalty> the second time it's run elementWithId.length returns 0
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> do you ever re-select it?
[14:25:49] <royalty> what do you mean reselect it?
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> once you do $elementWithId.replaceWith(returndata);, $elementWithId no longer exists.
[14:26:14] <robertmaxrees> you have to select it again
[14:26:24] <royalty> i think i know what you mean
[14:26:38] <royalty> i can't just define it once at the top
[14:26:42] <royalty> right now at the top i had
[14:26:43] <robertmaxrees> right
[14:26:48] <royalty> let $replacePanel  = $('#replace-applicant-list');
[14:26:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that will change.
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> i would consider tweaking things so you replace the contents of that element
[14:27:14] <robertmaxrees> instead of the entire element.
[14:27:31] <royalty> yeah that would be loads simpler
[14:27:56] <royalty> yeah i'll do it that way, thanks, i usually do things that way do not know why i wanted to do things differently now
