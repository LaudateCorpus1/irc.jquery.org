[10:21:09] <robertparkerx> Well I was going to ask for help why this https://jsfiddle.net/n1x0wdbk/ didn't work but it works on the test case
[10:21:14] <robertparkerx> it doesn't work on the dev site
[10:27:10] <robertparkerx> in my dev the object.width() is the same size for some reason
[10:33:39] <robertparkerx> on live there is a white-space: normal and if I remove this it goes back to one line
[10:33:49] <robertparkerx> if I add the rule to the selector it does nothing though
[10:37:07] <Cork> robertparkerx: what you say you add it to a selector, are you adding the value it gets when you remove the white-space?
[10:37:38] <robertparkerx> I'm adding white-space:nowrap to selector that has it on live but override on dev
[10:37:51] <robertparkerx> it appears the same but still the container div it add is equal to the container
[10:37:58] <robertparkerx> so it doesn't continue with the script
[10:38:00] <robertparkerx> it ends
[10:38:09] <robertparkerx> if( container[0].clientWidth > object.width() )
[10:49:35] <robertparkerx> if I remove this if it works but I suspect it should be static if it isn't large enough
[10:54:23] <robertparkerx> it doesn't pick up elements that are outside for some reason
[10:54:27] <robertparkerx> the width are the same
[15:25:36] <physikoi> I'm using an oldish version, so this may not be the case anymore, but i noticed what seems to be a bug. Given `<div id="id" data-loaded="true"></div>`, $("#id").data("loaded") => `true` while $("#id").attr("data-loaded") => `"true"`. Is that inconsistency a bug, or a feature?
[15:27:17] <Cork> physikoi: it is by design .data gives structured data while attr is always a string
[15:28:12] <physikoi> Cork: ah, ok. Thanks Cork
[15:28:14] <Cork> specifically .data loads from an internal data structure inside jquery, if jquery doesn't find anything it tries to read the same value from attr and JSON.parse the content
[15:28:39] <Cork> hence why "true" becomes true
[15:28:43] <physikoi> Caused an hour of headscratching, but good to finally get it
[15:29:32] <Cork> physikoi: it is documented here https://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:29:59] <physikoi> Thanks for the extra context and link :)
[15:30:10] <Cork> and it is actually quite important to understand the difference
[15:30:28] <Cork> as ex .data('loaded', false) WON'T change the attribute
[15:31:01] <physikoi> Looks like this gets at the crux of the question: "Every attempt is made to convert the attribute's string value to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null)."
[15:31:35] <physikoi> "as ex .data('loaded', false) WON'T change the attribute" D:
[15:32:09] <physikoi> ok, so that's very good to know. Easy to see how ignorance of that could lead to frustration. RTM as they say
