[05:36:27] <iwkse> hi, I have an issue with DOM updating. I dynamically create a table and append it to a div. After I get the top and left of each td in the table. There's some issue with DOM updating as I get all values equal to zero. From the console it works as expected. Any hint?
[05:41:38] <iwkse> one workaround I know it works is to set the top,left,width,height explicit when creating the object
[10:51:19] <spinningcat> how can i style html without adding https://jsfiddle.net/s1bt49g5/
[10:51:23] <spinningcat> any suggestin?
[10:53:08] <shoky> without adding what?
[10:53:46] <spinningcat> without adding body
[10:54:05] <shoky> huh?
[10:54:13] <shoky> you style elements with css :S
[10:54:30] <spinningcat> okay but that element is not in the body yet
[10:55:00] <spinningcat> my aim is to create an html and convert it to pdf
[10:55:53] <spinningcat> so i wont add that variable to page just convert variable content to pdf
[10:56:17] <spinningcat> you follow?
[10:56:34] <shoky> don't follow what your question is
[10:57:14] <spinningcat> i just wonder how can i style before adding body?
[10:57:53] <spinningcat> or anyway
[10:59:18] <shoky> var elem = $($.parseHTML(html)); elem.addClass('foo'); elem.css('foo','bar');
[11:00:43] <shoky> note you'll lose <html> and <body> probably, you'll get just the divs
[11:02:16] <spinningcat> i think adding html div and make it display:none is better option what do you think? https://jsfiddle.net/s1bt49g5/2/
[11:02:43] <spinningcat> think i will remove html and body
[11:02:50] <spinningcat> probably same thing
[11:03:09] <spinningcat> what is on my mind is styling html page and convert it into pdf does it make sense?
[11:06:23] <spinningcat> if you cannot follow please tell me
[11:07:32] <shoky> i don't know much about converting to pdf
[11:10:35] <spinningcat> me too
[11:10:40] <spinningcat> i just try to learn it
[11:15:32] <spinningcat> i did this https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/s1bt49g5/4/
[11:15:58] <spinningcat> but it didnt get styling this is understandable of course
[11:16:34] <spinningcat> i am sure parseHTML has something to include styling information too
[11:31:55] <spinningcat> YAY !!!
[11:31:58] <spinningcat> i did that
[12:00:13] <spinningcat> shoky,  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/s1bt49g5/24/
[12:35:11] <shoky> spinningcat: cool gladyou got it working
