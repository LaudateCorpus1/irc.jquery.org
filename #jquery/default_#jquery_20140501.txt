[00:43:32] <dan2k3k4> anyone used fancybox ? then do <div data-fancybox-href="someUrl" class="myClass"></div> $('.myClass').fancybox({ settings dont seem to do anything });
[00:56:37] <dan2k3k4> weird, seems to work fine on dev but not on prod (both same server, same files, and I force refresh without cache) o_0
[01:38:27] <nodedfree> ok, how can i change dynamic div with jquery? (when clicking on other dynamic element)
[01:39:15] <nodedfree> example: $('body').on("click", ".dyn_one", function() ({  })
[01:39:25] <nodedfree> how can i introduce the other div?
[01:39:57] <nodedfree> when i type $('.other_div').hide()  <--- doesn't work
[01:40:47] <nodedfree> tried $('body .other_div') aswell... not working
[01:41:22] <asturel_> imho $('.other_div').hide() should work
[01:41:39] <nodedfree> maybe find()?
[01:41:49] <asturel_> are u ssire thats a class?
[01:41:54] <nodedfree> 100%
[01:42:47] <nodedfree> ok works
[01:43:08] <asturel_> :)
[01:49:45] <the8thbit> hello
[01:49:57] <the8thbit> $( '#dock-stats-mail' ).css( 'color', 'green' ); is not changing the color to green
[01:50:18] <the8thbit> but I can do something like $( '#dock-stats-mail' ).css( 'font-size', '40pt' );
[01:50:28] <the8thbit> so I'm finding the selector and everything
[01:50:33] <the8thbit> I just can't change color
[01:52:50] <the8thbit> nevermind, I solved it
[01:52:56] <the8thbit> It was a link; I had to target a
[03:37:05] <puchacz> hi, can I have multiple submit buttons that send a different value than displayed? <input type="submit" name="action" value="D" value-displayed="Delete" />
[03:37:46] <puchacz> the reason I want them different is that displayed text can be localised
[03:38:06] <puchacz> so in Polish it would be <input type="submit" name="action" value="D" value-displayed="Usuń"/>
[03:40:43] <shout_user> puchacz: use <button></button> instead of <input type="submit">
[03:41:06] <puchacz> shout_user: thanks
[03:41:23] <shout_user> <button value="custom_value">Button text</button>
[03:41:41] <shout_user> not sure if necessary, but <button type="submit" ...> works too
[03:42:38] <puchacz> ok, I will go for button type="submit"
[03:42:46] <puchacz> and they have to have the same name, right?
[03:42:50] <puchacz> name="action"
[03:42:52] <puchacz> for example
[03:42:55] <shout_user> yeah
[03:42:58] <puchacz> thx
[03:51:36] <alexw> I have a jquery table where data is being entered
[03:51:59] <alexw> I have an add button at the end of the row - wheN i click this button I want to add another row
[03:52:08] <alexw> The thing is - where do I get the template for the row from
[03:52:19] <alexw> or should I copy the current row and result all the fields to default
[03:52:30] <alexw> or ajax the template
[03:52:57] <alexw> http://www.examplet.org/jquery/table.addrow.php
[03:54:32] <alexw> Seems like a very dated solution
[04:07:46] <PhonicUK> anyone know a good templating engine that supports JQ?
[04:57:54] <johnny> hello guys
[04:58:33] <Guest55280> i am trying to valid a UK postcode. According to jquery they is a default jquery function which does this
[04:59:16] <PhonicUK> Guest37246, there won't be something directly in jquery - but jquery can make it easier
[04:59:28] <PhonicUK> you just need to match it against a regex
[05:00:08] <PhonicUK> it also depends on how thoroughly you want to validate it, you can check that the format is correct but checking that it's a real postcode is far more tricky
[05:01:22] <Guest55280> PhonicUK http://pastebin.com/QfTe5yuT
[05:01:51] <PhonicUK> Guest37246, that code works on the assumption you're using the jquery validate plugin
[05:02:02] <PhonicUK> which isn't part of standard jquery
[05:02:51] <Guest55280> PhonicUK i am using the plugin
[05:03:02] <PhonicUK> then what's the issue? that code looks fine
[05:03:10] <Guest55280> i am using to valid tel, email, etc
[05:04:03] <PhonicUK> although I'm not certain that regex is quite right
[05:12:17] <Guest55280> dont think they is a way to validate it
[05:34:33] <Galaxy283> http://jsbin.com/vabuledi/1/ Beginner Jquery here, trying to understand each lines in this coding properly.
[05:35:02] <Galaxy283> I understand that it loads JSON-encoded data from the server using HTTP Get function?
[05:40:33] <Galaxy283> Hello?
[05:43:26] <ionas> Helloes
[05:43:38] <Galaxy283> How are you?
[05:47:49] <ionas> http://pastebin.com/bndKhBfR - any idea why the first find().on(‘change’… triggers while the 2nd does not?
[05:53:17] <ionas> nvm one element moved wrongly
[05:58:36] <Galaxy283> Part of my assigment is to understand what each line does in this coding - could you guys hint whether if I got the first 2 right?
[05:58:37] <Galaxy283> http://pastebin.com/Ste1JPTk
[06:08:04] <Tmw_> Looks allright - as long as the second comment applies to the next four lines of code ;)
[06:11:37] <Galaxy283> Tmw_ Thanks for the feedback, I'm working on the 3rd and 4th line comment right now.
[06:12:50] <Galaxy283> http://pastebin.com/wPU5v6ej
[06:13:05] <Galaxy283> I think I need to expand third comment a bit more.
[06:13:47] <Tmw_> Close ;)
[06:14:22] <Tmw_> The fifth line actually only declares a variable called items and assign it an empty array. It doesn't do anything with the data passed in by the $.getJSON function
[06:15:19] <Galaxy283> Oh yeah now that you've said that.
[06:15:37] <Tmw_> Line 8 - indeed, the $.each function can be used to iterate over arrays and such. It basically says, for every object in the array, fire the function
[06:16:03] <Tmw_> The // End...? comment is correct. It ends the callback function passed into the $.each :)
[06:16:34] <Tmw_> :) good luck
[06:16:42] <ionas> Galaxy283:  var items = [];  does not get any items
[06:16:49] <Galaxy283> Thanks, callback function - read that somewhere. Will look into that now.
[06:16:57] <ionas> $.each pushes them into the array
[06:17:04] <Tmw_> haha
[06:29:56] <Galaxy283> Tmw_ when you said "It basically says, for every object in the array, fire the function", could you explain "fire the function"?
[06:31:22] <Tmw_> Yea, sure!
[06:31:55] <Tmw_> You tell $.each that for every item in the data-array the function should be called
[06:32:17] <Tmw_> And both the index and the item will be passed into the function every time it gets called
[06:32:38] <Tmw_> Or in your case; the key and the value (key/val)
[06:33:31] <Galaxy283> That's what I've got so far, well.. close.
[06:33:44] <Tmw_> Awesome!
[06:35:24] <Galaxy283> I amended the end bit, explaining about key and value in my case.
[06:36:24] <Galaxy283> http://pastebin.com/bZFLekGH
[06:39:12] <Galaxy283> I can understand line 12 too, // Pushes the arrays in items, adding keys and values.
[06:43:50] <str8uplinux> does anyone know a good way to disarm links and images on a page? What i would like to do is just remove each link and image and replace it with the string values of their href/src attribute.
[06:46:48] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: That's interesting.
[06:47:06] <str8uplinux> BillCriswell: i'm giving it a go now.
[06:47:12] <BillCriswell> You could do: $('a,img').replaceWith(function(){ return this.href || this.src; }); I think?
[06:47:13] <str8uplinux> i'll let you know what i come up with
[06:47:17] <calma> can anyone help me to make validations in every step at fuelux wizard?
[06:47:43] <str8uplinux> BillCriswell: interesting approach
[06:48:06] <BillCriswell> We're very interesting.
[06:48:19] <str8uplinux> BillCriswell: well... that worked.
[06:48:22] <str8uplinux> haha
[06:48:47] <BillCriswell> Nice.

[06:55:02] <dinho> hi my bxslider for "Products", second slider of page.  is adding a max-width alone <div class="bx-wrapper" style="max-width: 475px; 0px auto;">, only in my file there is not this line style  http://tamand.com.br/~endotex/site/?lang=us
[06:55:25] <dinho> anyone know why this happens
[06:55:27] <dinho> ?
[07:00:03] <mayerbci> does anybody know why chrome on android will not work with number patters in a number text box - android/chrome behaves worst of all browsers
[07:00:52] <mayerbci> also does anybody have issues with page loads on android/chrome? everytime I push new code to my server this browser hangs and eventually loads a page
[07:06:12] <Galaxy283> Tmw_ could you give me a hand on line 25?http://pastebin.com/JdL60GDc
[07:06:58] <Tmw_> Sure
[07:07:15] <Galaxy283> Does this takes an array of "li" from line 12, joining the elements together in a string and assigning it to the html UL?
[07:07:31] <Tmw_> exactly! :)
[07:08:27] <Galaxy283> So my comments to line 12 is right?
[07:08:53] <Tmw_> 12 is correct
[07:09:05] <Tmw_> the comment on line 8 is a bit off i believe
[07:09:58] <Galaxy283> Is it?
[07:10:17] <Tmw_> "The callback passes an array and a corresponding array value each time" it actually gets passed in an key and a value. not an array and the array value :)
[07:10:33] <Tmw_> Where the key could be something like the key in an object
[07:10:45] <Tmw_> or the index of the item in the array (0,1,2,.. )
[07:10:55] <Tmw_> Other than thay, great job! :)
[07:11:46] <Galaxy283> Ah so its just simply replacing array with key and "corresponging array value" with value.
[07:11:57] <Galaxy283> corresponding*
[07:12:32] <Tmw_> That will do for the comment, as long as you understand what happens :)
[07:13:13] <Galaxy283> Thanks.
[07:13:42] <Tmw_> Sure :D
[07:16:51] <Galaxy283> For line 27, //Appends the newly created UL element with the child, li elements, to the body element - making it visible on the page.
[07:17:00] <Galaxy283> Straightforward?
[07:17:04] <Galaxy283> .*
[07:17:42] <Galaxy283> Then it ends appending the body elements.
[07:18:07] <Tmw_> Yeah, exactly!
[07:18:21] <Galaxy283> Perfect.
[07:18:41] <Tmw_> hmm, the last //ends
[07:19:04] <Tmw_> is actually the end of the callback function of $.getJSON
[07:19:14] <Galaxy283> Oh dang!
[07:19:20] <Galaxy283> didn't notice the blocks
[07:19:35] <Tmw_> But, the endresult will be the same though ;)
[07:25:12] <Galaxy283> Tmw_, suggest sample JSON notation expected to be returned by such a call. Could you hint on what this means or point me to the right direction please?
[07:26:27] <Tmw_> Do you have basic understanding of what JSON is?
[07:27:09] <Tmw_> The question basically asks what the contents of the 'ajax/test.json' file should be in order for this piece of code to work
[07:27:26] <Tmw_> ;) thats the hint
[07:31:40] <dinho> could someone help me? My bxslider is limiting the max-witdh alone.
[07:31:41] <dinho> The second slide is showing only 2 slides and 4 are noticed is adding max-witdh:. 475px; . But I do not have that style
[07:32:11] <dinho> my slide is here http://tamand.com.br/~endotex/site/
[07:32:12] <nodedfree> dinho, set the max-width:none;
[07:32:26] <dinho> is a second slide
[07:32:36] <dinho> Products
[07:33:13] <nodedfree> the problem is that you have another empty div's
[07:33:27] <nodedfree> <div class="slide bx-clone" style="float: left; list-style: none; position: relative; margin-right: 15px; width: 230px;">    	
[07:33:32] <nodedfree> this
[07:33:57] <dinho> how to solve. I do not know how to do
[07:34:52] <Guest64453> I'm in a bind.  I have a function that I use to listen for check box change in a table: $('input[name=PanelGridRowChk]').change(function(e){} .  When anyone checks a box, it fires and I am able to grab the value associated with that check box.  I have a checkbox in the header row.  If that checkbox is checked then all the row checkboxes is checked.  However, the row's checkbox being checked
[07:34:52] <Guest64453> does not fire the change function (when clicking on the header row's checkbox).
[07:36:49] <dinho> displays only 2 slides, no matter what I do
[07:38:06] <nodedfree> it will not be pretty if the slide will be streched
[07:38:25] <nodedfree> so you need more than 4 div's
[07:38:29] <nodedfree> at least
[07:41:54] <dinho> tanks. the problem was the wordpress loop
[07:54:17] <msafi> Can I use jQuery to get where the bottom of a scrollable element content is compared to the bottom of the element itself?
[07:54:45] <msafi> Like say, the bottom of the element is at 1000px, but its content's bottom is at 3000px.
[07:54:58] <msafi> How can I know that?

[08:07:25] <kenelliott> what is recommended for converting query params to an object? Doesn't seem to be a native query function for this. Found some lengthy alternatives, wanted to check with the community.
[08:11:19] <darkfrog> Default operation of hitting <Enter> on an Input field within a Form is to submit that form.  However, this does not happen in a jQuery UI Dialog.  Can someone tell me why and how to fix it?
[08:12:06] <NoiseEee> kenelliott: you can try whats suggested here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7128522/jquery-turn-querystring-into-object / https://gist.github.com/dancrew32/1163405
[08:13:35] <kenelliott> thanks NoiseEee those were the lengthy alternatives I was referring to.
[08:14:03] <NoiseEee> kenelliott: yeah benalman writes good code, i would personally choose that if i needed it
[08:14:34] <jonkoops> Hey guy
[08:14:38] <jonkoops> *guys
[08:16:01] <jonkoops> Quick question, is there a reason why .scrollLeft() triggers a scroll event twice? Setting it on the DOM node self only triggers it once.
[08:20:20] <NoiseEee> jonkoops: http://jsfiddle.net/VLqGV/
[08:20:29] <NoiseEee> jonkoops: ie: you're doing something else wrong
[08:20:51] <NoiseEee> or make a fiddle about your situation
[08:21:02] <jonkoops> Gimme a minute
[08:28:10] <jonkoops> Hmmm. I see it works just fine in my fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/VLqGV/1/
[08:28:31] <jonkoops> Weird. I'll try to find out what is different in my local setup.
[08:31:16] <jonkoops> Ahhh, it's the jquert.scrollstop plugin causing the event to occur twice.
[08:31:56] <jonkoops> Thanks anyways NoiseEee
[08:57:24] <guide_X> why would the nivo slider work, but not animate?
[08:58:40] <d0de> When I use rangeslider.js , a jQuery plugin, in a phonegap test application, it works great. When I use it in my actual phonegap application, it gives an error. I figure there must be something in my code that prevents it from working. But the only error reported in the console is inside rangeslider.js itself, not my code. I know that can't be the actual problem, because the exact same rangeslider.js file works in the test app. How can I 
[08:59:37] <duch_kazatel> d0de your message cut off.  normally errors like that mean you need to trace through your JS and look to see where you're feeding a bad value to the plugin
[09:00:18] <duch_kazatel> d0de stuff like that is why http://fixingthesejquery.com/ exists :)
[09:00:20] <d0de> duch_kazatel, any idea how I can do that kind of trace? I'm using phonegap, so I'm limited to the web console inside Eclipse, not a true web console
[09:00:37] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[09:00:51] <duch_kazatel> what's the error?
[09:01:06] <d0de>  TypeError: Result of expression 'e.originalEvent.touches[0]' [undefined] is not an object. at file:///android_asset/www/js/rangeslider.js:252
[09:01:27] <d0de> perhaps if I remove all my own code, and reintroduce it section by section until something breaks?
[09:01:31] <aleray> is there a way to retrieve a map object of all the css applied on the style attribute of an element?
[09:01:45] <duch_kazatel> d0de that could work.  normally stuff like that means you're feeling in a bad value somewhere.
[09:02:03] <duch_kazatel> aleray hrm?  a "map object"?
[09:02:11] <d0de> duch_kazatel, ok, I'll go hunting. Thanks
[09:02:45] <duch_kazatel> d0de sorry i can't be more helpful!  not familiar with phonegap, so that's about the best i can do.
[09:03:42] <aleray> duch_kazatel, a dictionnary
[09:03:50] <d0de> I decided to use phonegap/js because I thought it would be easier than trying to learn java from scratch. I'm not completely sure that's turning out to be true
[09:03:57] <aleray> like: {'color': 'red'}
[09:04:12] <duch_kazatel> aleray ooooh you mean an object :)  javascript doesn't have "maps" or "dicts" :)
[09:04:49] <MikeD_> if you don't learn vanilla.js, i don't think you should be allowed to use convenience libraries
[09:05:29] <aleray> duch_kazatel, yep
[09:05:33] <duch_kazatel> aleray there's no prerolled solution out there - you'd have to work your way through the elements computed styles.
[09:05:53] <duch_kazatel> butd doing that usually means you've got another problem - what are you trying to do?
[09:08:03] <MikeD_> is .addClass() smart enough to not add to className values that are already in it?
[09:08:29] <MikeD_> http://api.jquery.com/addclass/ isn't clear on how that'd be handled
[09:09:43] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ yep.
[09:10:23] <MikeD_> cool, i made a fiddle to test it... but still is good to have someone else corroborate
[09:10:37] <duch_kazatel> 9/10, jquery does that for yo.
[09:10:39] <duch_kazatel> *you
[09:10:52] <duch_kazatel> like the implied .each() it ruins for most methods.
[09:11:14] <aleray> duch_kazatel, I'm working on a visual wiki, using backbone. If I do http://dpaste.com/3CFBAEN/  I override the potential other styles
[09:11:52] <duch_kazatel> aleray how many styles are you doing this with?  normally, you'd add/remove classes as necessary.
[09:14:17] <aleray> duch_kazatel, users are free to put as many styles as they want
[09:14:19] <duch_kazatel> aleray and if you want to edit a single property and have css available, use .css('z-index', '5000');
[09:16:06] <BillCriswell> It's too sunny to work today.
[09:16:27] <duch_kazatel> aleray if you don't have jquery available, you should use the elm.style property in js.  there's also getComputedStyle().
[09:16:56] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i hear that.  what's the weather like over in philly?
[09:18:07] <nhulea> dude its like a fucking 100 here in la
[09:18:22] <nhulea> i ride my bike to work its already hot as hell
[09:18:26] <duch_kazatel> we're at 69 (heh) right now in norcal but it's supposed to get to 93
[09:19:44] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Sunny right now.
[09:19:50] <BillCriswell> It was pouring all day yesterday.
[09:19:53] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[09:20:37] <BillCriswell> We're at 70 right now
[09:20:43] <BillCriswell> Warmest it's been in a while.
[09:20:58] <drej> its still like 6c here
[09:21:02] <drej> and rainy and miserable
[09:21:07] <drej> and i dont wanna
[09:21:22] <BillCriswell> That's Canada right?
[09:21:31] <drej> yeah, toronto
[09:21:41] <BillCriswell> Canada is seeming more and more appealing to me.
[09:22:03] <nhulea> rob ford got caught with crack again !
[09:22:06] <drej> BillCriswell whenever you want to jump ship, you let me know i'll have a job waiting for you
[09:22:10] <drej> nhulea yup
[09:22:14] <drej> he stepped down now
[09:22:15] <aleray> duch_kazatel, yes, thing is I'd like to set the style attr manually because there is already some code that does this in my model.render() function
[09:22:17] <drej> for 30 days
[09:22:31] <aleray> duch_kazatel, a hack http://dpaste.com/0ZSYYKS/
[09:22:35] <nhulea> haha
[09:22:38] <BillCriswell> drej: Thanks! I'll let you know should it ever come to that.
[09:22:45] <duch_kazatel> aleray that's a really bad idea.  you should be setting specificed properties, not the style attribute.
[09:23:00] <nhulea> I am so sad chris farley never got to play rob ford he would have been great
[09:23:11] <duch_kazatel> ! that would have been amazing.
[09:23:12] <aleray> duch_kazatel, that's what I'm doing in the hack
[09:23:32] <duch_kazatel> aleray but in your render stuff you should remove the stuff where you set the style is what i'm seing.
[09:23:35] <duch_kazatel> *saying
[09:24:32] <BillCriswell> nhulea: https://twitter.com/crswll
[09:24:54] <nhulea> jesus christ
[09:25:02] <aleray> duch_kazatel, ok. That's because users can write down css in the source of the wiki page like this: http://dpaste.com/3CY1GFY/
[09:25:05] <BillCriswell> Quite possibly the best picture I've ever come across.
[09:25:05] <duch_kazatel> it's beautiful, BillCriswell
[09:25:12] <nhulea> thats some classic shit right there
[09:25:35] <MikeD_> $('<button>').appendTo('<footer>').appendTo( '#mysection' );  doesn't create the footer, does it?  that's not the kind of promise that chaining would deliver, is it?
[09:26:06] <BillCriswell> Can't look at it without laughing a bit.
[09:26:08] <duch_kazatel> aleray i would really reconsider that and make them supply a bunch of explicit key/value pairs.  if not, you should probably parse that string out instead.
[09:26:27] <aleray> duch_kazatel, ok, thanks
[09:28:48] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ i want to say it should, but the fiddle says otherwise.
[09:28:55] <nhulea> found it ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5oFTlae9cg
[09:29:27] <MikeD_> thanks, i put the footer create/append inside the  button.appendTo()
[09:30:11] <MikeD_> it's not exactly the most beautiful line of code, but i like it better than having a lot of local variables used only once... or .find() the element I just added
[09:30:28] <BillCriswell> The title they put for the video is hilarious.
[09:30:41] <duch_kazatel> we do local vars here because the meaningful names are really helpful.
[09:31:11] <nhulea> wow!
[09:31:32] <nhulea> wow adam sandler used to be funny at one point too
[09:33:01] <BillCriswell> I've asked this a hundred times, but I always wondered if I was to watch Billy Madison for the first time today if it would be funny or not.
[09:33:14] <BillCriswell> or Happy Gilmore... You know, the era of Sandler.
[09:33:18] <BillCriswell> that*
[09:33:43] <drej> billy madison was mostly filmed in my highschool
[09:33:44] <drej> while i went there
[09:33:56] <drej> the lunch rooms / most of the classrooms, when he's in highschool thats our school
[09:34:10] <drej> that auditorium at the end was my school too
[09:34:11] <drej> good times
[09:34:21] <BillCriswell> drej: Haha that's awesome.
[09:49:11] <vacho> is there a cleaner way of doing this?? $('#'+$('#guest-id-input')
[09:49:37] <duch_kazatel> what are you getting from $('#guest-id-input') ?
[09:49:51] <vacho> the val() of an input field.
[09:50:03] <vacho> that contains the ID that I want to get from a <tr id="x">
[09:50:06] <duch_kazatel> save the value to a variable and use that instead.
[09:50:28] <vacho> duch_kazatel: that doesn't make it much neeter.
[09:50:49] <duch_kazatel> it'll make things more readable long term.  Otherwise, that's about as good as it gets.
[09:56:28] <vacho>  shouldn't this work? $('#'+$('#guest-id-input').val()).filter('.check-out-ipad-btn').remove();
[09:56:54] <vacho> $('#'+$('#guest-id-input').val()) is a TR, the TR contains a TD with a button inside it with class 'check-out-ipad-btn'
[09:57:02] <duch_kazatel> theoretically, yes.
[09:57:14] <BillCriswell> vacho: I tsounds like you want .find().
[09:57:27] <vacho> BillCriswell: that's what I tried first..no luck
[09:57:43] <MikeD_> why would users know id numbers in your DOM?
[09:58:09] <vacho> MikeD_: ur asking me?
[09:58:17] <BillCriswell> vacho: That should work. Must be something else.
[09:58:49] <MikeD_> vacho: yes, that would expect the user to enter something into an input then you'd look up an element based on the value they entered ??
[09:58:49] <vacho> BillCriswell: it does..my mad..
[09:59:14] <vacho> BillCriswell: what is the difference between find and filter? :)
[09:59:25] <duch_kazatel> filter reduces the current set, find looks for descendents.
[09:59:25] <BillCriswell> filter would filter out the current set.
[09:59:36] <BillCriswell> Yes, that.
[09:59:47] <duch_kazatel> your filter code was to find an element with an ID and return only the one with a given class.
[09:59:56] <duch_kazatel> which doesn't make sense since an ID can only exist one time per page anyway.
[10:00:00] <vacho> I see..great thanks
[10:00:06] <BillCriswell> $('.some-list').filter('.special-list') would be like .some-list.special-list
[10:00:30] <vacho> so this is the cleanest way of doing it? $('#'+$('#guest-id-input').val())
[10:01:01] <duch_kazatel> no.  you should save $('#guest-id-input').val() in a variable and then use that instead.
[10:01:01] <BillCriswell> I'd use a variable like duch_kazatel suggests but yeah.
[10:01:38] <vacho> BillCriswell: so.. $('#'+VAR)
[10:01:39] <duch_kazatel> there is really no other way to dynamically generate selector strings.
[10:01:40] <vacho> like that?
[10:01:42] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:01:47] <vacho> ok thx
[10:50:41] <duch_kazatel> i feel like i just learned something amazing and feel like a huge dummy because i didn't see why it'd be useful before.
[10:51:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What might that be?
[10:52:27] <duch_kazatel> why you'd return a function from a function.
[10:53:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/94Dq8/ like this
[10:54:07] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:54:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Quality for keeping things private?
[10:57:17] <duch_kazatel> the second one only evaluates configObj once, instead of every time the function is called.
[10:57:47] <BillCriswell> Truff
[10:58:10] <BillCriswell> Does the need to be an IIEF or whatever the hell
[10:58:50] <duch_kazatel> IIFE, and yeah.  i could just use a javascript object i guess, but that'd require a little bit of massaging to keep things private.
[10:59:30] <BillCriswell> I was misthinking.
[10:59:33] <BillCriswell> Is that a thing?
[10:59:39] <duch_kazatel> is now.
[10:59:45] <duch_kazatel> (shipit)
[11:06:15] <BillCriswell> Just spend 10 minutes looking at "margin-right: none;" like it was correct.
[11:06:18] <BillCriswell> Just spent*
[11:08:08] <duch_kazatel> ugh i hate those days.
[11:18:15] <bufferloss> how do I chain promises so that I can pass values between them but also cause the entire chain to fail if an item in the middle fails?
[11:18:36] <bufferloss> I’ve read numerous stack overflow posts and the only conclusion I so far have is that i need to use e.g. Q or something similar
[11:18:49] <bufferloss> is that true or can this be accomplished using $.Deferred ?
[11:19:36] <bufferloss> also note that it’s not as simple as just using $.ajax, in my instance I won’t be using raw $.ajax but rather other various forms of asynchronous things such as e.g. setTimeout or similar non jQuery.ajax calls
[11:26:13] <zim> Hi all. How call I target $(foo ".className") where foo is something like this? var foo = $(this).closest('#foo');
[11:26:35] <duch_kazatel> foo.find('.classname');
[11:26:43] <duch_kazatel> or $('.classname', foo);
[11:26:44] <zim> duch_kazatel, TY
[11:26:53] <Jon47> bufferloss: $.when([promise1, promise2, promise3]) ?
[11:27:08] <Jon47> you can hang .done, .fail, .always off of that
[11:27:24] <Jon47> the compound deferred fails if any of its component promises are not kept
[11:27:33] <Jon47> it resolves only when all of its promises are kept
[11:27:34] <bufferloss> Jon47: does that A) guarantee the order of operations, and B) can I pass a value from promise one to promise 2
[11:28:09] <Jon47> oh, so promise2 needs to follow promise1, and depends on some value returned or set by promise1?
[11:28:17] <bufferloss> yep
[11:28:25] <Jon47> why not just do nested promises
[11:28:36] <Jon47> e.g. create promise2 in the resolution handler for promise 1
[11:28:50] <shoky> bufferloss: you can use .then to pipe promises and transform the data
[11:29:08] <bufferloss> shoky: from what I can tell .then() doesn’t honor failed promises in the middle
[11:29:20] <bufferloss> Jon47: because reasons :)
[11:29:23] <shoky> meaning what?
[11:29:50] <bufferloss> Jon47: mostly that it’s ugly, and it kind of goes against the purpose of promises, namely to be able to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style
[11:30:04] <bufferloss> Jon47: that method basically is no different than just doing lots of nested callbacks in the first place
[11:30:12] <bufferloss> which is what i’d have to do if I weren’t using promises
[11:30:43] <bufferloss> shoky: meaning that if I have 3 things that depend on each other, if the middle one fails it doesn’t stop the rest of the promise chain
[11:31:12] <shoky> bufferloss: like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/7Rzr9/
[11:31:57] <bufferloss> shoky: note the part about when I mentioned that I’m not using a regular $.ajax, but rather things like e.g. setTimeout which don’t natively return jquery promises
[11:32:19] <shoky> you can use $.Deferred to make promises out of that
[11:33:23] <shoky> function doSmthAsync() { var d = $.Deferred(); setTimeout(function() { d.resolve('somedata') }, 1000); return d.promise(); }
[11:33:48] <duch_kazatel> i ahte some of these third party companies we work with.
[11:39:51] <bufferloss> shoky: hmm, yeah I guess that does appear to work as I would expect
[11:48:39] <phlx>  Syntax error, unrecognized expression: select[name="appointment_order[card_year]"
[11:49:23] <NoiseEee> missing a closing ] there phlx
[12:04:24] <nhulea> hey so in mobile safari I have a .on click and it never makes it to the end of the function any idea why that would be http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/byF56/
[12:05:38] <NoiseEee> nhulea: does your console provide clues?  typically when it stops mid-function its because there's been an error before it
[12:06:39] <nhulea> yeah see thats the thing I am having trouble debugging cause its mobile safari and I am on a pc so I am getting really mixed results
[12:07:01] <nhulea> NoiseEee: but it works fine on mobile chrome
[12:30:37] <bumbar> does anyone know how to add validator for multiple select with jquery bootstrap validator?
[12:42:36] <sadtaco> How can I create a standards compliant jquery ui .button() link?  IE, if someone holds ctrl and clicks it it should open in a new window. I tried putting an "<a> inside, with stopPropagation() on the <a>, and $(this).find('a').click() when the button is clicked, but that doesn't work
[12:43:04] <sadtaco> I want the jquery ui button to behave exactly the same as an anchor with a href and target="_blank" would
[12:46:08] <arschmitz> sadtaco: like http://jsbin.com/rixer/1/edit ?
[12:46:25] <sadtaco> nevermind I should just .button an anchor instead of a <button>
[12:46:42] <sadtaco> I wanted to have my css styling different for buttons and a bt ah well
[12:46:59] <sadtaco> Yeah, what yo udid there
[12:50:46] <sadtaco> yeahhhh my styling is messed up using a instead of button.
[12:54:10] <nedrocks> I'm having serious issues with CORS and POST using jquery. It seems as though it's not making the requisite OPTIONS request. I see the POST coming through and my server is setup to send back the appropriate headers (I have it working with GET, for instance) but for some reason whenever I POST using jquery, no OPTIONS precedes it and it causes the request to be abandoned within the browser. Are there any known issues with this? I'm using jquery 2.1.0
[12:56:27] <shoky> nedrocks doing a cross-domain POST doesn't necessarily use the OPTIONS preflight
[12:58:09] <nedrocks> shoky: Ah, that's very interesting. Is there any way to force preflight options request?
[13:00:09] <shoky> that's really up to the browser.. but doing a POST with Content-Type other than form encoding or plain text should probably make it send it.. or using custom headers
[13:00:16] <shoky> but why would you want to force it
[13:01:04] <shoky> if the browser deems that there's no need for it, you should be good as long as you got the right headers for the POST itself
[13:01:05] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a video player for jquery that works with flash?
[13:01:29] <shoky> for the POST response itself*
[13:02:06] <duch_kazatel> tomasm- wut.  you want a flash video player?
[13:02:24] <duch_kazatel> that you can access using javascript?  or what?
[13:02:59] <nedrocks> shoky I thought so too but the browser is complaining about CORS. However if I request using the correct origin, the server returns correctly
[13:03:19] <shoky> what do you mean, using the correct origin?
[13:03:39] <MisutoWolf> Question:   Are there any good resources for someone wanting to learn jQuery but using Coffeescript?   I really like CS, but I'm wanting to get into jQuery.   Sort of new to both, I guess.
[13:03:46] <shoky> and what's it complaining about exactly? and do you have headers sent back in the POST response
[13:04:30] <nedrocks> shoky when I make an options request from command line, I appropriately get the right headers: http://pastebin.com/VnRV7TfV
[13:04:46] <nedrocks> however from the browser I'm not seeing those headers come back
[13:04:59] <jdo_dk> is it possible to get "data" from event.target ?
[13:05:29] <jdo_dk> i have tried: event.target.data("myData") i get undefined something error in console. :)
[13:06:41] <shoky> nedrocks: that's an OPTIONS request. what about the POST..
[13:07:06] <nedrocks> shoky POST is not returning the headers but I setup my server to explicitly not return headers for POST/GET
[13:07:13] <shoky> huh.
[13:08:18] <shoky> why?
[13:08:55] <nedrocks> I'm no expert on security but my understanding was the OPTIONS http method was explicitly to determine things like this
[13:09:02] <nedrocks> and returning those headers for all requests felt like a hole
[13:12:33] <shoky> i'm no expert either, but as i understand it the preflight is just an extra measure of security for certain types of requests, to ask the server if this endpoint supports CORS
[13:12:54] <nedrocks> Got it. I'll add these headers on POST requests and see if that fixes it...
[13:28:40] <deadlymuffin> list chan
[13:29:37] <MisutoWolf> why isn't this working (color isn't changing)
[13:29:46] <MisutoWolf> http://pastebin.com/zmbTcXui
[13:30:09] <MisutoWolf> the console.log is working, so the selector is fine, but the color isn't changing like it should be, apparently
[13:30:46] <NoiseEee> MisutoWolf: paste JD
[13:30:47] <NoiseEee> JS
[13:31:40] <MisutoWolf> I don't actually have the vanilla JS, as I've been writing in CoffeeScript, I can just pastebin what it's converted to
[13:33:32] <NoiseEee> sure
[13:34:33] <MisutoWolf> http://pastebin.com/zvY5db2h
[13:34:57] <MisutoWolf> That's the JS.
[13:35:34] <NoiseEee> i've actually never used animate(), is color something it handles?
[13:35:43] <MisutoWolf> it's supposed to, yeah
[13:36:36] <NoiseEee> i think you might need https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color to animate color
[13:36:59] <NoiseEee> could be wrong though :P  i thought animate() was really about positioning
[13:37:23] <MisutoWolf> Oh.
[13:37:27] <MisutoWolf> That could very well be it, then,.
[13:38:42] <guyz> with jquery ui accordion, how do you have it work with content higher then 128px?
[13:43:15] <MisutoWolf> oh cool
[13:43:18] <MisutoWolf> that plugin fixed it
[13:43:20] <MisutoWolf> thanks, NoiseEee
[13:43:32] <MisutoWolf> I didn't realize that default animate() was only positioning
[13:43:37] <NoiseEee> np good luck MisutoWolf
[13:43:37] <MisutoWolf> I guess I didn't read the API docs closely enough
[13:43:42] <MisutoWolf> works fine now :)
[13:52:19] <__joshua__> " I didn't realize that default animate() was only positioning": I don't see that in the docs
[13:53:10] <MisutoWolf> i guess it's just suggested, since it talks about stuff like width and other "numeric" properties
[13:53:15] <__joshua__> anything numerical can be by default,
[13:53:28] <MisutoWolf> i guess they don't count hex as "numeric"
[13:53:29] <__joshua__> opacity, font-size, border-width etc
[13:53:32] <MisutoWolf> as opposed to stuff like height
[13:53:46] <MisutoWolf> oh well
[13:53:53] <MisutoWolf> i included the color plugin and it worked immediately
[13:53:56] <MisutoWolf> so now i know~
[13:54:05] <__joshua__> cool
[13:54:17] <MisutoWolf> or "single numeric value"
[13:54:27] <MisutoWolf> "All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used). Property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified. The units em and % can be specified where applicable."
[14:32:29] <cofu> I want to dynamically add a checkbox to a jquerymobile control group, it works but its not adding the checkbox within ui-controlgroup-controls which is leaving it poorly formatted...

[17:03:18] <ekcolysp> hey guys, I am looking at trying to stop a clickspam, on a page, and was wondering if someone could guide me to some tutorials/instructions?
[17:04:36] <ekcolysp> basically, i have a page with 10 odd links, and whenever someone tap spam on those links, i want to capture it, discard the events and only use the last action/tap
[17:05:00] <ekcolysp> tap spam = tapping one link multiple times, or tapping multiple links in a very fast sequence
[17:06:57] <funnieguy> you can register timestamp on click
[17:08:41] <funnieguy> put it in an array
[17:09:41] <funnieguy> sorry not needed
[17:10:56] <funnieguy> onclick 1. check if last timestamp more than  for example 1 second 2. store timestamp fire link
[17:11:45] <funnieguy> e.preventDefault() to stop
[17:11:48] <funnieguy> if using <a>
[17:12:01] <funnieguy> if not a clickable <span> will also do
[17:40:48] <ekcolysp> thanks funnieguy, will give it a go
[18:13:34] <funnieguy> ekcolysp how is it
[19:07:01] <s2013> i want to check the value being typed as its being typed in a textbox. i used keypress but i need to convert it to int so if i type 1 it says NaN but when i type 2 it shows 1, etc

[19:23:19] <zylophon1> when adding elements dynamically, how can i force them to be draggable. i have draggable set up for a class, and i understand the elements aren't draggable because they were created after the .draggable run, so, can i call it manually?
[19:23:37] <jtri> hello, I'm looking at using jquery to create custom events that allow modules on a page to communicate, does that sound familiar to anyone?  I'm using a client side rendering engine and have been attaching objects to window for this, but believe jquery has some infrastructure for this through custom events?
[19:26:10] <zylophon1> sheesh, i just wrapped it in a method, and called that!
[19:31:26] <jtri> zylophon1: in my case, the way the rendering engine works, in order to scope components, they are isolated from communicating that way
[19:38:05] <zylophon1> jtri: look up events on the jquery website
[19:38:24] <zylophon1> i see jquery is kinda dead at this time of night/day
[19:40:57] <jtri> zylophon1: no worries, just wanted to put a sound out to see if anyone uses events this way
[20:09:20] <b1lly> custom css selectboxes ftw http://b1lly.github.io/gumi/
[20:20:24] <Velveeta> we have something similar as an internal jquery ui widget at our company.. i'm about to rip it to shreds and rebuild it from smaller components
[20:20:34] <Velveeta> whenever i have the time, anyway
[20:21:25] <b1lly> huh
[20:22:36] <TerryLeigh> hi guys, has anyone had luck splitting up words into syllables? i.e. hello > ['hel','lo'] ?
[20:22:46] <Velveeta> i'm in the process of breaking all of our widgets down into their core components, and using those to construct larger compound widgets from, like our select widget
[20:23:24] <Velveeta> so e.g. an option list would be one component, a popover-style overlay would be another, a button would be another... you inject an option list into a popover and insert it with a button to create a select component
[20:23:59] <Velveeta> they all communicate via event messaging, so none is coupled to any other directly, only through their parent component wrapper (e.g. the select widget itself), which delegates that traffic back and forth between the individual pieces that comprise it
[20:24:47] <Velveeta> terryleigh: i've never tried anything like that, but it seems like the logic to figure out what constitutes a syllable in a given word would be fairly complex... there are some standard rules like double letters and whatnot, but there are some complicated ones also
[20:26:05] <Velveeta> like how do you determine when to split on vowel/consonant pairs like in a-li-bi, vs alphabet (al-pha-bet as opposed to alp-ha-bet)
[20:26:38] <TerryLeigh> Yup, a lot of logic involved.
[20:30:14] <beancurd> sounds like something you use nltk for

[21:07:26] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: I believe the categories are devided to like graphic design, seo ,etc. ex: "<a href="#filter" data-option-value=".gdesign">graphic design</a>". It's on the http://linxdigital.ca/portfolio.html   i don't know if thats what you meant?
[21:07:58] <BillCriswell> Where is the script that you're using to do the filtering though?
[21:10:00] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: I'm guessing in a JS file. in the JS folder?
[21:11:32] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: is there a way to look at the source online and tell where the filter is being called from?
[21:15:31] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: All this code is minified. I'd have to look through all of it to try to understand what's going on.
[21:16:18] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: if I got you the unminified verison, would you have some time to take a look? i would greatly appreciate it!!
[21:16:38] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: Probably not tonight. Headed to bed soon.
[21:18:26] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: could you give me a email to send you the files? I just don't know how to troubleshoot something like this. I could offer you a small tip even though that's prob not worth anythign for someone of your knwoeldge
[21:18:59] <Velveeta> ekcolysp: if you're using chrome (not sure about support for this in other browsers) you can do something like this in your console: dir($('#myElement')[0])
[21:19:16] <mangostein> Is it bad practice to not use if statements without else if you don't have any other condition?
[21:19:28] <BillCriswell> mangostein: Not at all.
[21:19:31] <Velveeta> mangostein: i wouldn't consider that bad practice
[21:19:32] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: You're greatly over estimating me.
[21:19:39] <mangostein> Thanks!
[21:19:45] <Velveeta> i *do* consider it bad practice to not *always* use curly braces on those kinds of things
[21:19:50] <Velveeta> even on single statements
[21:20:47] <BillCriswell> hmmhesays: I'm not interested in doing that work, though. You should really try and figure it out. It's a good thing to learn!
[21:21:16] <mangostein> what if you could combine multiple if statements in a single if, else if, else if ......, else statement?
[21:21:33] <mangostein> Is there a problem with not doing so?
[21:22:00] <ekcolysp> if, elseif etc are continuous flows
[21:22:08] <Velveeta> so long as they're mutually-exclusive clauses, that's fine to combine them, if they're not mutually-exclusive, they should be left separate
[21:22:14] <ekcolysp> if, if if, are disjointed flows
[21:22:34] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: could you point me where you saw the error then? so i can trouble shoot? and so you think its a js file thing. not the html document?
[21:22:47] <mangostein> okay got it. thanks!
[21:22:52] <Velveeta> also, you should be aware that there's technically no such thing as an else if in js: http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/12/10/js-conditionals/
[21:22:57] <BillCriswell> mangostein: Sounds like you could use a switch statement maybe.
[21:23:08] <ekcolysp> if it's 8am, I GOTTA RUSH, else if it's 7:30 am, then i should get up, else if it's 7am, I can sleep some more
[21:23:09] <BillCriswell> hmmhesays: Absolutely. Are you in Chrome?
[21:23:21] <Velveeta> they're basically just single-line statements executed on an else clause, nested over and over
[21:23:51] <mangostein> BillCriswell: Yeah I considered using a switch statement but it sucked for readability
[21:23:55] <ekcolysp> that's a direct flow
[21:24:10] <ekcolysp> an example of a disjointed flow would be
[21:24:52] <ekcolysp> if it's 7:30 am, I gotta get up. If it's raining, I should get an umbrella
[21:25:05] <Velveeta> ^^ rightio
[21:25:07] <ekcolysp> those 2 events doesnt affect the others, and so they're disjointed
[21:25:17] <Velveeta> so it just depends on how your if statements relate to each other
[21:26:59] <mangostein> Well, in my case it would be that I'm binding a lot of elements to a single event listener within a function and I have a ton of if statements to indicate which ones are selected. Would that be a direct flow or disjointed? Because it's all related to the click event but realistically different sections
[21:28:07] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: could you point me where you saw the error then? so i can trouble shoot? and so you think its a js file thing. not the html document?
[21:28:22] <BillCriswell> mangostein: How do you decide what elements are selected?
[21:28:46] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: I said "Absolutely. Are you in Chrome"?
[21:29:05] <mangostein> BillCriswell: .on click with event delegation
[21:29:20] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: oops, must have missed that. And yup I am!
[21:29:26] <BillCriswell> mangostein: Yeah but how you you decide "this element is ok, but not this one"
[21:30:03] <mangostein> if (that.is('#id)){ //ajaxcall here }
[21:30:22] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: Click the hamburger icon menu, then to go "tools" then click "developer tools"
[21:30:29] <BillCriswell> and when you scroll you'll see the error I saw.
[21:30:49] <BillCriswell> mangostein: What makes that id ok over id2?
[21:32:10] <mangostein> BillCrisswell: just depending on what user clicks. I'm trying to do different ajax calls depending on what they click. So if they click page 5 of pagination, I'd ajax in the page 5 content or if they click About us, then I'd load in the About us content
[21:32:16] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: I have the tool open. am i scorlling the the website itself or the code? and what does the error look like?
[21:32:47] <BillCriswell> You'll see in the "Console" tab and it's as you scroll the site.
[21:34:20] <BillCriswell> mangostein: Are the elements you're clicking links?
[21:34:20] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: now do you think the "top" is in the javascript or the html file?
[21:34:43] <mangostein> BillCriswell: yeah they're all links, <a> tags within a <div>
[21:35:02] <BillCriswell> hwamokp66: It would be in Javascript somewhere. In an external file or in <script> tags in the html.
[21:35:28] <BillCriswell> mangostein: Why are you looking at the id if you can just load the href off the link?
[21:35:38] <hwamokp66> BillCriswell: okay, I'll do a serach in those places. Thanks for your help!!
[21:36:50] <BillCriswell> mangostein: I can't imagine this being too much more than: $('nav').on('click', 'a', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $('main').load(this.href); });
[21:43:15] <b1lly> thoughts on code structure? https://github.com/b1lly/gumi
[21:43:27] <b1lly> and or design pattern
[21:44:24] <mangostein> BillCriswell: Not sure if I'm doing it right but here's how the code looks: http://dpaste.com/23K6114/
[21:48:27] <BillCriswell> mangostein: I think I'd have to see the bigger picture for this whole thing to understand.
[21:50:05] <BillCriswell> b1lly: It seems good to me, but you're probably better than me at this so not sure how much advice I could offer haha.
[21:56:05] <b1lly> BillCriswell: thanks :P
[21:56:55] <b1lly> mangostein: what's the problem you're having
[22:27:22] <kneekoo> hello
[22:27:42] <kneekoo> how do I select stuff from a text retrieved with ajax inside a variable?
[22:48:14] <kneekoo> anyone active here?
[22:48:35] <kneekoo> I'm stuck
[22:49:38] <kneekoo> I used $.get to store a page in a variable, then I want to use jquery to select someting inside that variable
[22:49:55] <kneekoo> but I don't know how to select the data
[22:50:40] <beancurd> can you get console.log to output the data?
[22:50:57] <kneekoo> yes
[22:52:15] <kneekoo> although it's a bit weird - it shows an object with 3 items that I can separately select as $(data)[0], $(data)[1] and $(data)[2]
[22:52:28] <beancurd> yep.
[22:52:45] <beancurd> so you have an array ..
[22:53:29] <kneekoo> well, there are more items in the object/array
[22:53:39] <kneekoo> it depends on the document structure
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> $(stuff);
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> [
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> #text
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> ,
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> <title>​Test​</title>​
[22:53:54] <kneekoo> ,
[22:53:56] <kneekoo> #text
[22:53:58] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:00] <kneekoo> <script src=​"http:​/​/​code.jquery.com/​jquery-2.1.0.min.js">​</script>​
[22:54:02] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:02] <beancurd> when you say items, do you mean you have dom objects?
[22:54:05] <kneekoo> #text
[22:54:06] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:08] <kneekoo> <h3>​Data expirării: 201407​</h3>​
[22:54:10] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:14] <kneekoo> #text
[22:54:16] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:18] <kneekoo> <table>​…​</table>​
[22:54:20] <kneekoo> ,
[22:54:22] <beancurd> waoah dude.
[22:54:23] <kneekoo> #text
[22:54:24] <kneekoo> ]
[22:54:24] <beancurd> wall of text.
[22:54:26] <kneekoo> oops, sorry
[22:54:33] <kneekoo> sorry, I thought it would post a single line
[22:54:36] <beancurd> heh.
[22:55:04] <Uhkis> smarter clients ask "are you sure" if the paste would be longer than n lines :-)
[22:55:15] <beancurd> dat weechat.
[22:55:20] <kneekoo> XChat doesn't ask :)
[22:55:26] <kneekoo> ancient client I guess
[22:57:03] <kneekoo> so how do I select inside that object/array?
[22:57:21] <kneekoo> or can I?
[23:06:17] <abishek> Hi Cork, Morning
[23:07:28] <kneekoo> hello abishek
[23:07:44] <abishek> kneekoo, hello
[23:08:20] <kneekoo> do you know how to select inside a variable?
[23:21:08] <funnieguy> kneekoo
[23:21:09] <funnieguy> you there?
[23:22:31] <kneekoo> yup
[23:23:16] <funnieguy> you solved your problem?
[23:23:35] <funnieguy> i'm not sure about firebug
[23:23:43] <funnieguy> but in chrome
[23:23:43] <kneekoo> not yet, I'm still looking for clues
[23:23:53] <funnieguy> you can click on network in developer tools
[23:24:04] <funnieguy> to see the response from the $.get()
[23:24:23] <funnieguy> at least know that the response from the web service is correct
[23:24:48] <kneekoo> funnieguy: I already have a successful output in console.log
[23:24:59] <kneekoo> I just don't know how to select inside that code
[23:25:09] <kneekoo> I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16590824/jquery-selector-inside-of-variable
[23:25:27] <kneekoo> but it's not close to what I need
[23:25:29] <funnieguy> i'm not sure what you mean by select inside the code
[23:25:50] <kneekoo> I just want to get the content of a certain cell inside the first row of a table
[23:26:06] <kneekoo> I can get it with jQuery if I select directly in that page
[23:26:24] <kneekoo> but I have no idea how to select the same thing when I put the page inside a variable
[23:27:01] <funnieguy> oh do you mean $(data).find("tb #id")?
[23:27:14] <funnieguy> you mean your web service returns html code?
[23:27:15] <kneekoo> jQuery(".price_sorted .m_price:first").text().split(" ")[0].trim();
[23:27:24] <kneekoo> that's how I select it directly in the page
[23:27:30] <funnieguy> yes
[23:27:38] <funnieguy> what does your data look like
[23:27:57] <funnieguy> your data is <table></table>
[23:28:01] <funnieguy> ?
[23:28:39] <funnieguy> $(table).find(".price_sorted .m_price:first").text().split(" ")[0].trim()
[23:28:49] <funnieguy> i'm not sure if i'm right
[23:29:03] <funnieguy> but web services should return objects not html code
[23:29:08] <funnieguy> it can work fine
[23:29:12] <kneekoo> I'll try that
[23:29:17] <funnieguy> but i find it weird
[23:29:54] <funnieguy> normally web service will return for example json {"price_sorted":[1.2,3,4,5.5]}
[23:30:10] <funnieguy> do the html in javascript
[23:30:25] <kneekoo> I just get regular html with $.get
[23:30:31] <funnieguy> yeap i get it
[23:30:35] <funnieguy> just saying
[23:30:36] <kneekoo> I wish it was JSON
[23:30:49] <kneekoo> I would've solved it by now
[23:30:56] <funnieguy> you mean webservice isn't within your control?
[23:30:59] <funnieguy> oh damn
[23:31:11] <funnieguy> so does .find work
[23:31:43] <kneekoo> it's an online game that I'm building a userscript for
[23:32:31] <kneekoo> I want to spend less time finding out which food type is more profitable so I get the prices for all types and do the math
[23:32:41] <_Hans> jayhi jay7134 :)
[23:33:42] <jay7134> Hi
[23:34:00] <funnieguy> kneekoo, yeap so does .find work
[23:34:19] <kneekoo> no, it doesn't
[23:34:41] <beancurd> kneekoo: so you have an array of strings that may or may not be html objects?
[23:35:09] <funnieguy> what is output of console.log(data)
[23:35:17] <funnieguy> <table></table>?
[23:35:24] <beancurd> just remembering that list, it was mixed dom objets and css selectors.
[23:36:40] <kneekoo> my internet connection is 64kbps so I have a hard time coping with refreshes and testing :P sorry about that
[23:36:51] <kneekoo> I'm on vacation and this is all I have
[23:37:01] <funnieguy> do you have chrome or firebug
[23:37:10] <kneekoo> chrome
[23:37:47] <funnieguy> if you go to network tab you can see the $.get() response don't need to refresh
[23:37:55] <funnieguy> and in console you can do tests
[23:38:13] <funnieguy> probably save the data as a global variable
[23:38:20] <funnieguy> and do console.log()s
[23:38:27] <funnieguy> on the console
[23:38:53] <joy4u> hi everyone
[23:39:31] <funnieguy> hi joy4u
[23:40:17] <joy4u> i am using jquery validation from http://jqueryvalidation.org i want to implement that if a url field have value then only it will validate the url how to implement that?
[23:40:33] <joy4u> my code is jQuery.validator.addMethod("youtubeVideo", function(value, element) {
[23:40:34] <joy4u> 		return /^(https?:\/\/)?(www\.)?youtube.com\/watch\?v=([a-z0-9-]+)/i.test(value);
[23:40:34] <joy4u> 		}, "Must be a valid Youtube video");
[23:40:34] <joy4u> 		
[23:40:34] <joy4u> 		$(".youtubeVideo").rules('add', {
[23:40:34] <joy4u> 			url_field: {
[23:40:35] <joy4u> 				 required: function(element) {
[23:40:35] <joy4u> 				 	return $(".confirmpassword").val() > 13;
[23:40:36] <joy4u> 				 },		
[23:40:36] <joy4u> 		     	youtubeVideo: true
[23:40:37] <joy4u> 			}
[23:40:37] <joy4u> 		});
[23:41:11] <joy4u> funnieguy: hello buddy
[23:42:23] <joy4u> can anyone help me?
[23:42:33] <funnieguy> hold on
[23:43:44] <kneekoo> funnieguy, beancurd: it looks like .find worked after all :)
[23:43:59] <kneekoo> it took me 7 minutes to finish the test, but I actually have high hopes :P
[23:44:03] <funnieguy> kneekoo yes it should
[23:44:04] <funnieguy> WOW
[23:44:16] <funnieguy> unless its partial or invalid html
[23:44:21] <funnieguy> like no closing tag
[23:44:29] <funnieguy> or with css
[23:44:33] <kneekoo> I have the correct values in console.log :)
[23:44:55] <kneekoo> now I just have to use them as planned
[23:44:58] <funnieguy> i'm not sure why it'll take you 7mins haha
[23:45:14] <kneekoo> my internet :)
[23:45:20] <kneekoo> I had to download 7 pages
[23:45:44] <joy4u> funnieguy: can you tell me what is the prob
[23:46:13] <kneekoo> if they had an API so I can get JSON it would work just great but what I do is kind of "brute-force" :P
[23:48:32] <joy4u> can anyone tell me what is the problem with the code
[23:49:44] <funnieguy> joy4u firstly required is whether the field is necessary for the form to submit http://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method
[23:52:08] <joy4u> funnieguy: i have test by removing the required
[23:53:58] <funnieguy> $(".youtubeVideo").rules('add',{youtubeVideo:true})
[23:54:23] <funnieguy> replace .youtubeVideo with the url field
[23:54:54] <funnieguy> anyway i don't think youtubeVideo is a class. if it's intended to be a single element please use #
[23:56:20] <funnieguy> and don't use youtubeVideo as the function name
[23:56:27] <funnieguy> use something like isYoutubeURL
[23:56:51] <joy4u> funnieguy: now it is not validating the link and yeas youtubeVideo is also a class
[23:59:24] <abhvym> i have one variable in flask. how can i display the value of this variabl in a div using jq?
[23:59:51] <abhvym> can i do {{ var }} = #div in document.ready?
