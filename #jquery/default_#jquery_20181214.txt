[02:10:28] <RandomSerb> hello. I have an div, with n Ps inside, each P having an input field inside it. How can I gather all these inputs and use them as data in post request?
[02:10:40] <RandomSerb> currently struggling with jquery's each
[02:16:32] <devi8> RandomSerb, $("p>input").map(function () {return $(this).val();} maybe?
[02:16:54] <devi8> forgot the end ");"
[02:17:07] <RandomSerb> devi8, I need to read about map
[02:17:52] <RandomSerb> currently I'm doing var foobar = $("#myid :input"); foobar.each(function() { ... })
[02:18:41] <devi8> $("#myid :input") probably won't work...or at least I don't recognize it.
[02:19:20] <devi8> $("#myid p>input") would ensure that you get all the inputs inside of paragraphs in the #myid element
[02:19:22] <RandomSerb> devi8, it actually does work
[02:19:37] <devi8> I'll have to lookup the :input selector...interesting
[02:19:38] <Cork> RandomSerb: i would recommend wrapping those ps in a form
[02:19:41] <RandomSerb> devi8, yeah, that's the surrounding div's id
[02:19:56] <Cork> then firstly you will get the correct behaviour by the browser
[02:20:05] <Cork> and you can easily just do form.serialize()
[02:20:11] <RandomSerb> Cork, for the purpose of FormData or...?
[02:20:24] <Cork> RandomSerb: no, just the element
[02:20:33] <RandomSerb> oh... that makes much more sense.
[02:20:34] <Cork> it doesn't have to have a url endpoint
[02:20:51] <devi8> Oh, you were looking for all inputs, like textarea, input, etc. I though you wanted all input elements only.
[02:21:00] <RandomSerb> so, <form id="foobar">... $("#foobar").serialize()
[02:21:05] <Cork> yup
[02:21:16] <Cork> or serializeArray if you prefer that
[02:21:24] <RandomSerb> most likely I do
[02:21:42] <RandomSerb> I need to read on serialize as well, but I presume it produces json like format
[02:21:45] <Cork> (there are a nice third party plugin serializeObject that is even nicer)
[02:22:07] <Cork> RandomSerb: array produce an array of name and values
[02:22:17] <Cork> serializeObject generate a json like syntax
[02:22:38] <RandomSerb> Cork, thanks, but I'm writing an WordPress plugin, I'd like to stay away from 3rd party software as much as possible
[02:22:54] <RandomSerb> Cork, also, I can always JSON.stringify.
[02:22:58] <Cork> RandomSerb: serializeObject is like 40 lines of code or something like that
[02:23:06] <Cork> it is just a wrapper around serializeArray
[02:23:08] <RandomSerb> I know, but then Envato will whine
[02:23:31] <RandomSerb> and harass me as if I was a mass murderer
[02:23:40] <RandomSerb> been there, done that
[02:23:49] <Cork> well then you will have to live with [{ name:"", value:""},{ name:"", value:""}] syntax
[02:23:58] <RandomSerb> Cork, oh, I sure can
[02:24:17] <RandomSerb> thanks for helping out

[06:14:58] <Woet> https://cla.js.foundation/jquery/jquery
[06:15:36] <AdamPDotty> Maybe you need a special jquery version to see that information.
[06:16:21] <Woet> wat.
[06:22:15] <undefined_bob> Woet: weird how did you get to that page?
[06:22:23] <Woet> undefined_bob: I checked github.

[06:43:07] <Woet> lmao
[11:00:51] <devi8> Any suggestions for avoiding the wobble on scrolling of the sticky header in this fiddle? (colors and layout just for demo): https://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/bp5dvt07/
[13:22:20] <taplar> whop whop whop
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> yarr
[13:26:40] <taplar> how goes it?

[13:28:19] <taplar> :o you too?
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> it's been an awful few years, man.
[13:44:25] <pieter> If anyone has a minute, much appreciated. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53784203/not-seeing-results-when-using-jquery-typeahead
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> pieter am I missing something or are you not including the typeahead library in your snippet thjere?
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm haha
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> sec
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> pieter so basically, you have this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvzjch0b/1/
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:24:34] <pieter> robertmaxtrees: the typeahead css is missing there, but apart from that, yes. See https://jsfiddle.net/rofx74p0/
[14:24:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> that's missing everything.

[14:26:36] <MassDebates> what am i looking at
[14:26:39] <MassDebates> it looks really interesting
[14:26:42] <MassDebates> i want one
[14:32:20] <VectorX> hi
[14:32:35] <MikeD_> is there anything i need to do if $.post( url, data ) to make a cross-domain post to a webservice that is ok with accepting posted content from anywhere?
[14:32:57] <taplar> you shouldn't have to
[14:33:07] <MikeD_> cool
[14:33:38] <pieter> robertmaxrees yes that's it.
[14:34:12] <VectorX> so i got this example, where when you click in the white or gray area around the square(iframe) it loads a page. when you click the alternate it removes the soruce and reloads if clicked again, this takes time, is there a way to make the reload instant since the page was already loaded once, https://jsfiddle.net/Lcbt0dh8/
[14:34:53] <VectorX> im doing it this way since there is some interative elements that keep playing when you switch iframe and i want them to restart on each click
[14:35:09] <VectorX> stop previous/restart current on clicks
[15:11:17] <VectorX> anyone?
[15:33:51] <c_bluntish> helllooooo everyone :)
[16:24:36] <c_bluntish> what, if any is the difference between variables defined using $varname ="meh" or var varname ="meh"?
[16:26:20] <shoky> c_bluntish: no difference between 'var $varname'  and 'var varname'
[16:27:43] <c_bluntish> so if I say var $somename -'' I can later say somename or does it have to be $somename? is $ seen as part of the string varable name, or does $ have special meaning?
[16:36:12] <shoky> c_bluntish: it has no special meaning whatsoever, it's just a character like any other
[16:36:20] <c_bluntish> ah
[16:36:26] <shoky> $somename is not the same as somename, no
[16:36:28] <c_bluntish> in php one needs the $
[16:36:39] <shoky> screw php :P
[16:36:44] <c_bluntish> nail php even!
[16:37:01] <c_bluntish> apoxy php!
[16:38:00] <shoky> aw yea.
[16:41:31] <c_bluntish> shoky seen this online and thought you might like it https://www.tradebit.com/usr/dlc3marketing/pub/9002/32169551_9067113_I_Hate_PHP_400.jpg
[16:42:36] <shoky> yea i eat that for cereal breakfast
[16:43:15] <c_bluntish> no wonder you hate php!
[17:52:50] <c_bluntish> can someone please help me, been googling it for ages .... I am returning a json object like so {"user1":"10","user2":"11","user3":"12"} how can I loop though that, do I have to turn it into an array, I was to just loop though creating something like '<div data-extra="'+$K'">'+$v+'</div>'... any advice would be greatly apricated
[17:53:55] <taplar> you can use Object.keys() on it to get an array of the keys
[17:53:59] <taplar> and loop over that
[17:54:35] <c_bluntish> hi :)
[17:55:57] <taplar> so Object.keys(object).forEach(function(key){ ... }) would iterate passing in user1 then user2 then user3
[17:56:23] <taplar> however, if you are wanting to create new things, you may want to use map() instead of forEach()
[17:57:46] <c_bluntish> thank you sir
[17:59:09] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/hjy6wdkg/ dummy little example c_bluntish
[18:00:51] <c_bluntish> thank you sir
[18:00:57] <c_bluntish> what does the join('') do?
[18:02:01] <c_bluntish> ah it removes , but why are their any , in there?
[18:03:08] <taplar> the result of map is an array, but innerHTML is a string
[18:03:26] <taplar> so to turn the array of strings into a single string, i join them on nothing ('')
[18:03:38] <c_bluntish> ahhhhh
[18:03:50] <taplar> ['a', 'b', 'c'].join('') === 'abc'
[18:04:48] <c_bluntish> ah thank you so much
[18:04:55] <taplar> np
[18:05:20] <c_bluntish> so the join(); is called before the string is returned?
[18:05:35] <taplar> Object.keys().map().join()
[18:05:52] <taplar> keys() will execute first and return an array of the string keys
[18:06:09] <taplar> then the map will run, and return an array of whatever you make that method return
[18:06:36] <taplar> in this case it returns an array of strings
[18:06:42] <taplar> so then once that returns, the join will execute
[18:07:20] <c_bluntish> so each method, does its thing, and any data returned / changed is then passed to the next function, until join, then the final data is returned?
[18:07:40] <c_bluntish> I didnt know that
[18:07:52] <c_bluntish> I shoujld of
[18:07:55] <c_bluntish> thank you so much!
[18:08:01] <c_bluntish> that has helped me tons
[18:08:48] <c_bluntish> so the order of how methods are called is paramount :)
[18:09:06] <taplar> yep, most javascript logic executes in sequence.  or what is called "procedural logic"
[18:09:26] <taplar> you do one thing, it finishes.  it may or may not return a result
[18:09:35] <taplar> but if it returns a result, you can chain method calls off of it
[18:10:12] <c_bluntish> nice! thats an awsome feature... is that a js thing or something that jquery has brought in
[18:10:13] <c_bluntish> ?
[18:10:24] <taplar> it's a fairly common programming concept
[18:10:33] <taplar> most languages start off from a procedural logic concept
[18:11:42] <taplar> it's so common that once you start delving into things that break that paradigm, most programmers will start having a hard time
[18:12:39] <c_bluntish> indeed
[18:13:36] <c_bluntish> thank you again :)
[18:13:39] <taplar> sure
[18:15:09] <c_bluntish> taplar++;
[18:15:24] <taplar> no, C++.  i am not a language
[18:15:38] <c_bluntish> hehe
[18:15:42] <taplar> ^_~
[18:18:49] <c_bluntish> I noticed you use ` rather than ' ... is this so you can put vars inside {} in the string?
[18:19:39] <taplar> yeah, one second
[18:20:35] <c_bluntish> :)
[18:21:13] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
[18:22:29] <c_bluntish> ahhhh
[18:22:30] <c_bluntish> nice
[18:30:38] * c_bluntish proposes taplar for +v
[18:30:48] <taplar> what's that?
[18:33:14] <c_bluntish> its channel status on irc, means you can kick people and moderate a  channel, its one down from +o meaning ops
[18:35:10] <taplar> usually not an issue, so probably no big rush to get more mods
[18:35:13] <c_bluntish> would be something like /msg ChanServ  VOICE [#channel [nick]] /chanserv mode +v #jquery taplar
[18:35:28] <c_bluntish> I used to run an irc server for 15 years
[18:35:42] <Gh0st_Preacher> i know how it's done ;) not our call sadly.
[18:35:53] <robertmaxrees> trying to work with people for it.
[18:36:02] <c_bluntish> nice! :) hi robertmaxrees  btw
[18:36:11] <c_bluntish> you two are such a help
[18:36:30] <c_bluntish> thanks again, many thanks, if I had a camel I would gradly donate 1 hump to each of you
[18:36:55] <robertmaxrees> i just don't get to write much code these days hhaahhaa
[18:37:07] <robertmaxrees> keeps be from getting rusty
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> *me
[18:39:18] <c_bluntish> you should sir
[18:39:35] <robertmaxrees> plus taplar is funnier than i am.
[18:39:41] <c_bluntish> you are superb at it, you and taplar are both guru's compared to me
[18:39:53] <c_bluntish> remember that from old amiga's "guru meditation"? lol
[18:40:15] <robertmaxrees> not old enough for that ;)
[18:40:48] <c_bluntish> hehe I am 43 next year, remember writing pathetic apps when I was 8 in sharp basic
[18:41:03] <robertmaxrees> hah.  my first machine was a mac classic II.
[18:41:10] <c_bluntish> mz 700 - sharp basic:)
[18:41:55] <c_bluntish> nice! my first proper computer after 8bit folly was the acorn electron, then the atari 1200, then amiga 500, 1200, then pc
[18:42:17] <c_bluntish> chucky egg on acorn electron, awsome game!
[18:42:28] <c_bluntish> I emu and still play it today
[18:42:32] <robertmaxrees> ah, you're from the other side of the pond.
[18:42:41] <c_bluntish> indeed, UK :)
[18:42:49] <c_bluntish> in work 11:34 pm
[18:42:57] <c_bluntish> 11:44 *
[18:44:36] <c_bluntish> cold -2c in the uk today, there was ice on my car at 5pm and its not even january
[18:45:01] <taplar> it's a muggy 50 here, paired with rain
[18:45:48] <c_bluntish> nice, sounds like a summer uk day, muggy with rain, overcast with rain, more rain, cold + rain ... and if your lucky, snow when you least expect it!
[18:46:10] <c_bluntish> taplar
[18:46:32] <c_bluntish> in that fiddle, you say... document.body.innerHTML += Object.keys(datareturned).map(function(key){} ...
[18:46:35] <taplar> you can keep your snow.  we don't get snow here.  we 99% of the time get ice
[18:46:39] <taplar> yep
[18:46:57] <c_bluntish> is it nessary to say document.body.innerHTML += ...
[18:47:08] <taplar> the += is effectively concatenation
[18:47:19] <c_bluntish> yes :) I mean ...
[18:47:27] <taplar> it's not necessary in the fiddle, no
[18:47:32] <taplar> just habit
[18:47:33] <c_bluntish> is it possible, to just process the data
[18:47:42] <taplar> what do you mean?
[18:48:36] <c_bluntish> erm, so I can just process the json, store it in a variable without doing anything to document body, then later I can do $(selector).html(mydivcontainingvar);
[18:48:46] <taplar> oh sure
[18:55:15] <taplar> catch you guys later.  i need some food and sleep, ^_^
[19:06:14] <c_bluntish> later taplar oh
[19:06:15] <c_bluntish> damn
[19:14:55] <c_bluntish> can anyone tell me what I am doign wrong?
[19:16:02] <c_bluntish> I am trying to loop through a json object returned from a ajax request, and I keep on getting garbled results
[19:16:11] <c_bluntish> this is exhausting
[19:27:06] <c_bluntish> dataType: 'json' ... grr
[19:27:12] <c_bluntish> how did I miss something so simple
[19:34:35] <c_bluntish> is anyone about?
[19:55:02] <inthl> I have a one dimensional json string in my script as variable, like var myarray = ["foo", "bar"]; ...how do I figure out wether a string is in there? something like in_array. so my string is bar and I just want a boolean result wether it is in myarray yes or no
[19:57:06] <shoky> inthl: that's a js array, not json.  and you can do myarray.includes("bar")
[19:57:18] <inthl> hm
[19:57:47] <inthl> that array comes from PHP, I did print json_encode($myarray); there. so how come that this is not json?
[19:58:27] <shoky> inthl: your php output was json, and the client-side js script has parsed that json text into a js array
[19:58:32] <shoky> json is just text
[19:59:27] <shoky> jquery and most ajax libs parse JSON for you (at least in common scenarios)
[19:59:36] <inthl> well actually the output from PHP is exactly what I wrote before, which is:  ["foo", "bar"]
[19:59:46] <shoky> right,  that is also valid JSON
[20:00:07] <inthl> so `var myarray` would contain a json?
[20:00:12] <shoky> no
[20:00:19] <inthl> meh
[20:00:22] <shoky> it would contain a js array, created by parsing the json text
[20:00:39] <shoky> e.g. var myarray = JSON.parse('["foo","bar"]')
[20:00:53] <shoky> that was done for you by jquery
[20:01:04] <inthl> ah, now I get it :>
[21:39:29] <c_bluntish> why do I get this error "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/"  when performing a simple ajax request ?
[21:39:45] <robertmaxrees> are you doing "async: false"?
[21:39:56] <c_bluntish> yes!
[21:39:59] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[21:39:59] <c_bluntish> I have to
[21:40:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:40:03] <c_bluntish> ah
[21:40:08] <robertmaxrees> you likely don't have to.
[21:40:12] <c_bluntish> really?
[21:40:14] <robertmaxrees> a small refactor would fix it.
[21:40:20] <c_bluntish> do tell
[21:40:23] <robertmaxrees> callbacks.
[21:40:25] <c_bluntish> hi btw :)
[21:40:41] <c_bluntish> would you like to see me code? Im proud hehe
[21:40:45] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().then(function(theData) { /* whatever relies on theData here */ });
[21:41:01] <robertmaxrees> feel free to share out to the channel :)
[21:42:43] <c_bluntish> yeah prob not to good an idea now that I think of it
[21:42:49] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[21:43:01] <robertmaxrees> and either way, you'll just need a minor refactor.
[21:43:46] <c_bluntish> looking up .then
[21:43:57] <robertmaxrees> callbacks.
[21:44:07] <robertmaxrees> and promises, really.
[21:44:24] <robertmaxrees> but you can do some cool stuff with async code in js.
[21:46:19] <c_bluntish> wow a lot of stuff to look up, jquery is so huge
[21:47:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:47:04] <c_bluntish> thanks for the advice :)
[21:47:11] <robertmaxrees> this particular piece isn't even jquery specific.
[21:47:31] <robertmaxrees> the language itself added promises a few years ago.  js handles async really well these days.
[21:49:13] <c_bluntish> js has came on leaps and bounds since early 2000's since I started messing about with it.... wish I had continued with it
[21:49:30] <c_bluntish> I feel like I am in an uphill struggle
[21:49:42] <robertmaxrees> what do you normally write in?
[21:51:19] <c_bluntish> c#, php :)
[21:51:35] <c_bluntish> I was a legacy vb6 dev for 10 years
[21:53:01] <c_bluntish> made some good money from vb6, everyone else left it, I was one of the only devs left in the market who knew vb6 ....
[21:53:29] <c_bluntish> sad story of lazyness and other bs and I never skilled up, so now im catching up :)
[21:53:40] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.  so you just need to get your head around the mental model for asynk
[21:53:44] <robertmaxrees> *async
[21:56:35] <c_bluntish> hrm, you are right, I am loving how far languages have came
[22:00:37] <c_bluntish> CAPITANOOO ... how are the seas today? safe to sail? noooooooo?
[22:00:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:00:53] <robertmaxrees> pls don't ping people like that :)
[22:01:10] <c_bluntish> I was just making fun of his nick ? :)
[22:01:22] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' it can be annoying ;)
[22:01:22] <c_bluntish> this is irc, I thought it would be cool
[22:01:24] <c_bluntish> sorry
[22:01:28] <robertmaxrees> no big! :D
[22:01:40] <c_bluntish> Im very annoying by my nature!
[22:02:02] <c_bluntish> I ran an irc servr for 15 years .... its one of the few places left where you can just chat and be yourself
[22:02:12] <robertmaxrees> sure
[22:03:14] <c_bluntish> shame its dying, only decent server left is freenode :) but thanks for the heads up, I keep on thinking of fealing like I am on my own old server
[22:03:32] <robertmaxrees> nah.  irc isn't dying.  just changing
[22:03:45] <c_bluntish> well the usecase has changed
[22:04:58] <c_bluntish> yeah, its certainly not the piracy based, smutty depth of perversion that it once was, I used to say, if society is a sink, people on irc live in the ubend
[22:07:01] <c_bluntish> usenet, now that is dying
[22:07:06] <robertmaxrees> hahaha true
[22:07:29] <c_bluntish> shame. comp.development* was awsome
[22:08:34] <c_bluntish> usenet has a group, or did for ms office document object model, I remember when writing a small db for a hospital, at the time that usegroup was golden!
[22:40:50] <c_bluntish> bed for me, thanks Rob, peace :)
[22:40:58] <c_bluntish> have a great weekend robertmaxrees  and the rest of the channel
[22:41:02] <c_bluntish> :)
