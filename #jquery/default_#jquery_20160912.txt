[00:06:55] <Nicu> ok, so $(selector).length counts properly in Firefox and Chrome and it returns undefined in Chromium
[01:52:26] <Cork> Nicu: no, it doesn't if you run in the browser console you might have another function then jQuery as $ though
[01:52:43] <Cork> try with jQuery(selector).length
[01:52:55] <Nicu> Cork: I'll try, thanks
[01:53:42] <Nicu> nope: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined(…)
[01:54:09] <Cork> then make sure the lib is loaded
[01:54:20] <Cork> cause THAT is your problem
[01:54:22] <Nicu> it is loaded
[01:54:27] <Cork> no it isn't
[01:54:35] <Cork> then you wouldn't get undefined
[01:55:16] <Cork> you can get a lot of other things, but not undefined
[01:55:20] <Nicu> normally I would agree, but that little selector issue is part of a script based on jQuery and that's the only thing that doesn't work
[01:55:38] <Cork> the script with the selector is loaded
[01:55:46] <Cork> the jquery lib isn't
[01:57:56] <Nicu> Cork: my script does several things with jQuery on that page, and all of them work except for that bit of code
[01:58:08] <Nicu> that implies the library is loaded
[01:58:17] <Nicu> or I would get nothing at all
[01:58:23] <Cork> then you're doing window.jQuery = undefined
[01:58:38] <Cork> cause it really can't be undefined unless it isn't loaded or explicitly removed
[01:59:44] <Cork> also, make sure you don't run this part of the script before jquery is loaded
[01:59:57] <Cork> as that can happen, depending on how your site is structured
[01:59:59] <Nicu> Cork: but then why would the same page work in Firefox and Chrome?
[02:00:12] <Cork> cause you're focusing on something that doesn't matter
[02:00:21] <Cork> the browser isn't the cause of this problem
[02:02:05] <Cork> if you need help figuring out what is happening link the site
[02:05:26] <Nicu> Cork: thanks, I'm doing some more research now
[03:07:23] <Nicu> Cork: thanks for the tip, I found my mistake - which made jQuery go hide in terror :P
[03:07:32] <Cork> :)
[03:08:13] <Nicu> this and the scope... a classic :))
[05:23:15] <earational> hey
[08:18:29] <rjCousineau> Hello
[08:19:07] <rjCousineau> I have nested checkboxes, where when a child is checked, the parent gets checked as well. I can't seem to make it work.. I made a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/621q1s66/
[08:20:17] <Cork> rjCousineau: you want closest() not parentsUntil
[08:22:21] <surial> I have a <div> with a bunch of divs below that. I have a selector that contains 2 such inner divs, stored in variable 'children'. I call children.detach() on this and then outerDiv.prepend(children). This causes children to be duplicated. ????? How the what the?
[08:22:56] <surial> If I remark out the prepend code, the 2 divs disappear. If I remark out both, they stay where they were. It's just the detach/prepend mix that causes a random duplication. jquery bug or some such? Where do I go from here?
[08:24:32] <Cork> rjCousineau: alternatively something like https://jsfiddle.net/621q1s66/1/
[08:24:45] <Cork> surial: make a jsfiddle
[08:27:01] <surial> Cork: It'll probably not occur except in this specific circumstance. hmmm..
[08:27:05] <surial> but it's a good next step, thank you.
[08:32:20] <surial> Okay, update: I animate 3 things in a row: elem.animate({cssprops}); elem2.animate({cssprops}); elem3.animate({cssprops}, someDur, "swing", function() {completer}); <-- here the completer function is called TWICE. And that is not helping the issue.
[08:32:25] <surial> why would that happen?
[08:33:10] <Cork> again make a jsfiddle
[08:34:03] <Cork> if you want help with code syntax not working, the context that code runs in matters a lot
[08:34:21] <Cork> so it is MUCH easier to help if you can see the code (and often it is vital to be able to do it)
[08:35:40] <surial> yeah, agreed. At any rate, using a boolean latch to avoid double-running and doing the detach/prepend in a setTimeout(..., 0) fixes it.
[08:35:53] <surial> But will remember to just jsfiddle a self contained working example next time. Thanks and have a nice day :)
[08:36:12] <Cork> it often doesn't even have to be a working example
[08:36:44] <Cork> but if you feel you need to explain what the code is; you should have created a fiddle
[09:25:50] <rjCousineau> Is there a way to slice the last item from the selection query?
[09:26:28] <Cork> ryanneufeld: http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[09:42:19] <doev> hi
[09:43:02] <doev> I need to access an element that is inside an iframe. But the iframe is empty. Is there a trick?
[09:45:44] <doev> hmm, I see there is a protection against that
[09:45:50] <doev> makes sense
[09:47:20] <rjCousineau> Hello. I'm trying to recursively traverse by .closest('ul').parent() but i'm getting infinite loop.  How can I stop my selection by specific node? I try .not('ul.root') but that doesn't work. I keep getting .length === 1
[09:48:34] <rjCousineau> oh. nevermind.. .closest('ul').parent('li') does the trick
[09:51:08] <Cork> rjCousineau: did you see the link i gave you?
[09:51:39] <rjCousineau> I seen the slice link, but slice wasn't what i used
[09:51:53] <Cork> i'm talking about https://jsfiddle.net/621q1s66/1/
[09:52:26] <rjCousineau> working example: https://jsfiddle.net/621q1s66/2/
[09:53:03] <rjCousineau> Cork: thats very nice actually
[09:53:45] <Cork> it should simplify what you want to do quite a bit
[09:54:33] <Cork> it isn't perfect though...
[09:54:45] <Cork> (it doesn't check parent siblings and so on)
[09:55:52] <rjCousineau> yea it's very clean. I notice if two cousins are checked, and one of them is unchecked, the parent is unchecked, which is invalid.. it's pretty good though
[09:56:11] <rjCousineau> *grandparent is unchecked
[09:56:20] <Cork> ya, that is what i talked about
[09:56:21] <rjCousineau> that's is the way with traversing
[09:56:27] <Cork> anyway gtg
[09:56:30] <rjCousineau> thanks Cork
[10:43:40] <lianzinho> hey guys, could you help me with this code: http://pastebin.com/PnKYxMrL | it should change the attribute sequentially in the set interval, but it is changing all at once after the last time…
[10:46:41] <dni-> lianzinho
[10:55:52] <lianzinho> dni-: hey
[10:56:00] <lianzinho> any idea?
[11:04:24] <lianzinho> ?
[11:07:04] <dni-> jo could use async
[11:07:55] <dni-> https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/v1.5.2/README.md
[11:08:05] <dni-> .eachSeries()
[11:09:08] <dni-> in your paste, is index really an int?
[11:12:54] <lianzinho> dni-: yes its tá index jQuery automatically iterates in .each()
[11:13:18] <lianzinho> dni-: in fact, i’ve just realized that the problem maybe with SVG
[11:13:25] <dni-> yeah ;)
[11:13:45] <lianzinho> i’m animating just one path but tha animation is being applied in all of them
[11:14:14] <lianzinho> I don’t know why, maybe because of ids
[11:15:29] <lianzinho> yeah.. I guess I have figured it out… in my svg i have a mask
[11:15:36] <dni-> :)
[11:15:44] <lianzinho> and a group like this: <g mask=url(#arrowMask)>
[11:16:12] <lianzinho> so, everytime I change the mask it applies everywhere
[11:16:20] <lianzinho> because the id is unique
[11:16:33] <FancyCamel> Hey there, I'm trying to understand the ^= operator. A code snippet I found has: jQuery('[id^=\"taxonomy\"]'), can someone briefly explain what exactly the ^= does here?
[11:18:03] <snover> FancyCamel: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[11:18:34] <FancyCamel> Oooh, I was reading the mozilla but and it was giving me some craziness with an XOR
[11:18:37] <FancyCamel> Thanks !
[11:42:33] <z1haze_work> can you do $(this + 'p') or does it not work like that?
[11:43:04] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[11:46:42] <fh_me> z1haze_work: how about $(this).find("p") ?
[11:47:00] <taplar> or $('p', this) if he is trying to find nested elements
[11:47:26] <taplar> which i'm assuming he is trying to, but have to ask, :)
[11:49:53] <z1haze_work> wanted to find the p after it
[11:50:00] <z1haze_work> so find wouldnt work, right?
[11:50:05] <z1haze_work> because it isnt inside
[11:50:08] <z1haze_work> i used .next('p')
[11:50:39] <taplar> boom
[11:52:39] <z1haze_work> thanks guys
[11:56:27] <fh_me> Would $('>p', this) work?
[11:56:51] <taplar> that would be immediate nested elments
[11:56:57] <fh_me> japp
[12:56:27] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[12:56:57] <taplar> yup
[13:03:05] <lazyreader> Hi, has anyone had sudden issues with Chrome 53 and jquery?
[13:04:49] <lazyreader> I'm getting stack overflow errors on calls to isPlainObject()
[13:05:43] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?'
[13:06:43] <lazyreader> 1.11.3
[13:06:50] <lazyreader> last of the 1.x line
[13:07:51] <robertmaxrees> thjat's not the last of the 1.x line fwiw.
[13:08:08] <lazyreader> wait you're right
[13:08:12] <lazyreader> there's 1.12 now
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> i might try updating to that and see what happens, if that doesn
[13:09:28] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't help, maybe make a test case?
[13:09:53] <lazyreader> worth a shot
[13:10:13] <lazyreader> yeah, this is deep within a big hairy codebase so I hadn't had a chance to pull out a testcase yet
[13:26:43] <taplar> yeah, reach into that big hairy base and pull out a testy
[13:26:48] <robertmaxrees> #WELP
[13:26:53] <robertmaxrees> disappear.gif
[13:27:28] <bolovanos> hithere - is it possible in this bootstrap constellation address #partB and #subpartB2 from within url? https://jsfiddle.net/7ffLf00p/
[13:27:44] <bolovanos> I am able to adress example.com/index.html#partB but not both together
[13:28:07] <bolovanos> probably jquery / js would help any hint pls?
[13:28:16] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:52:59] <z1haze_work> haha
[14:05:22] <bolovanos> ok skipping to php with it...
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused hahaha
[14:05:57] <robertmaxrees> bolovanos your question didn't make any sense
[14:09:26] <lazyreader> I think the answer is "no, you can't have two anchors at the same time in a URL"
[14:17:10] <decx> you can build your own hash to state function
[14:24:48] <bolovanos> lazyreader, decx ok thank you :)
[15:32:20] <RottenCore> anyone home
[15:32:21] <RottenCore> ?
[15:32:31] <robertmaxrees> about 560 someodd people ;)
[15:33:00] <z1haze_work> im at work
[15:33:44] <z1haze_work> and in fairness, theres < ~20 active users in this channel
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> super active.  some people come and go.
[15:37:52] <aro> why is jquery executing the error function when it is a successful response?
[15:37:57] <aro> even the status code is 200
[15:38:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the body of the response?
[15:38:14] <robertmaxrees> a 200 != you have a valid format.

[15:40:16] <lianzinho> :D
[15:40:23] <aro> robertmaxrees
[15:40:23] <aro> http://pastebin.com/SKgAK0iL
[15:40:33] <robertmaxrees> aro what's the ajax code for the call?
[15:41:11] <aro> http://pastebin.com/XX0Kyzv8
[15:41:34] <robertmaxrees> ffff pastebiiiin.
[15:41:43] <aro> ?
[15:41:44] <robertmaxrees> lol what's the "type" your using?
[15:41:51] <aro> that would be GET
[15:42:47] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.  i'd have to see it fail.
[15:42:57] <robertmaxrees> but i'll bet there's an issue with the response format.
[15:43:21] <aro> does 5000 need to be inq uotes
[15:43:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:43:59] <aro> what about true
[15:44:05] <robertmaxrees> that's a valid boolean.
[15:45:03] <aro> http://pastebin.com/ViqhXRYR
[15:45:11] <aro> is there a way to check the jquery code
[15:45:16] <aro> to see whats causing ti to fail
[15:45:21] <robertmaxrees> the jquery code isn't your problem here.
[15:45:37] <aro> its not
[15:45:38] <aro> but
[15:45:42] <aro> it can tell me why its failing
[15:45:43] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[15:45:46] <aro>                     deferred.rejectWith( callbackContext, [ jqXHR, statusText, error ] );
[15:45:50] <aro> 1.12 i think
[15:45:52] <aro> something
[15:46:01] <aro> thats the line thats triggering the failure
[15:46:16] <robertmaxrees> try .fail(function(jqXHR, statusText, error) {console.log(error)});
[15:46:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the second and third args to that.
[15:47:02] <aro> dppppp
[15:47:07] <aro> SyntaxError: Unexpected token m in JSON at position 3(…)
[15:47:07] <aro> \
[15:47:15] <aro> i dont see that token
[15:47:23] <aro> jesus christmas
[15:47:30] <aro> do the property names need to be in quotes
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> means it thinks it's getting a string.
[15:47:40] <robertmaxrees> for valid JSON, yes - double quotes.
[15:48:12] <aro> ok apparently jquery didnt like that
[15:48:18] <robertmaxrees> didn't like what?
[15:48:29] <aro> not having double quotes in the property names
[15:48:40] <robertmaxrees> that means that it's treating your response as JSON.
[15:48:49] <aro> well its supposed to be
[15:48:52] <aro> its a json object
[15:49:02] <robertmaxrees> errrr.
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> valid JSON requires double quotes then :)
[15:49:13] <aro> gotcha :)
[15:49:14] <robertmaxrees> JSON is not javascript fwiw.
[16:13:55] <tokam> hello, I have a validator and a filter which both get triggered by the change function of an input field.
[16:14:06] <tokam> my issue is that the validator is executed before the filter is applied
[16:14:27] <tokam> can I trigger the event in the filter funtion again, in case something was changed?
[16:14:38] <tokam> can I somehow influence the order of callbacks being called?
[16:14:45] <robertmaxrees> not for event handlers.
[16:14:58] <robertmaxrees> generally you don't want to rely on order.
[16:16:29] <tokam> ok how can I re-trigger the event?
[16:16:47] <robertmaxrees> you can use .trigger(), but I'd rewrite your handlers into a single one
[16:17:09] <tokam> the other one comes from a plugin
[16:17:22] <robertmaxrees> i might see if you can hand it a custom validator, then.
[16:17:25] <robertmaxrees> that also handles the filter.
[16:18:21] <tokam> works now thanks
[16:18:34] <robertmaxrees> i
[16:18:37] <tokam> my function handles the filter. a plugin is the validator.
[16:18:49] <tokam> I call trigger('change') in case I changed something in the filter
[16:19:06] <robertmaxrees> *i'd still consider making a custom handler for that validator that also handles the filtering.
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[16:39:07] <gagi_shmagi> Hey guys and happy programer day, does anybody tried to make breadcrumbs with jquery and have a working example to learn from?
[16:43:59] <docmur> I'm trying to write a little plugin that will open the URL passed from a link in a new windows, this is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/9zm7mqLp/
[16:47:19] <taplar> you know that can be done by putting a "target" attribute on the link, right?
[16:48:18] <docmur> I did not actually
[16:49:29] <taplar> https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/a.html
[17:05:48] <ragas> whoami
[17:05:53] <robertmaxrees> ragas?
[17:06:06] <ragas> -NickServ-  ragas is not a registered nickname.
[17:06:11] <taplar> i think, there for i am, i think
[17:06:14] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:58:49] <RottenCore> anyone home?
[17:58:56] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore yep.
[17:58:59] <taplar> @work
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> still a bunch of people here :)
[17:59:03] <RottenCore> i’m stuck.
[17:59:09] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[17:59:11] <RottenCore> I’ve used this form: http://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Creating-A-Modern-Multi-Step-Form-with-jQuery-CSS3.html
[17:59:14] <RottenCore> on this page
[17:59:22] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landingtest2
[17:59:33] <RottenCore> and for some damn reason it stops working
[17:59:43] <robertmaxrees> define "stops working"
[18:00:10] <RottenCore> it does nothing
[18:00:14] <robertmaxrees> also: that page isn't loading for me.
[18:00:16] <RottenCore> well the first fieldset works
[18:00:17] <RottenCore> goes to the second fieldset
[18:00:18] <robertmaxrees> mind setting up a jsfiddle?
[18:00:23] <RottenCore> and then nothing
[18:00:29] <RottenCore> sure. want the whole page?
[18:00:35] <robertmaxrees> just the form.
[18:00:47] <robertmaxrees> just the minimum needed to replicate the problem.
[18:01:32] <RottenCore> cool. one moment
[18:03:14] <RottenCore> it calls these two scripts, too: https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/Jqform/Index_files/jquery.min.js
[18:03:26] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/Jqform/Index_files/jquery.easing.min.js
[18:06:01] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/zpov4vdh/
[18:06:05] <RottenCore> there’s the jsfiddle
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> so the fiddle should be functional.
[18:07:44] <robertmaxrees> you can include third party stuff under the "external resources" on the left.
[18:08:03] <robertmaxrees> i might use a CDN for those, though.  and make sure you link in that jquery forms lib.
[18:11:55] <RottenCore> Ah ok. never had to use it before
[18:11:55] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/zpov4vdh/
[18:11:55] <RottenCore> there ya go
[18:12:53] <robertmaxrees> also: youc hgeckeneed to hit "update" and then share the new link.
[18:13:08] <robertmaxrees> wtf  - should be "you need to hit update and then share the new link"
[18:13:35] <taplar> drinking at work, -_-
[18:13:51] <robertmaxrees> hahaha they actually don't let us do that any more except for after 4:00 on fridays.
[18:14:42] <taplar> it use to be a popular thing here during retro someone would request a beer and wine cart
[18:16:10] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore also: you checked your console and stuff, right?
[18:16:17] <robertmaxrees> like - you're not getting js errors and stuff are you?
[18:16:35] <RottenCore> i’ve checked the console, yes
[18:16:40] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[18:16:56] <RottenCore> new link: https://jsfiddle.net/zpov4vdh/1/
[18:17:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm still not seeing jquery or the other stuff linked in.
[18:17:50] <RottenCore> oh actually there is an error. I think I see what I did
[18:17:52] * RottenCore feels dumb
[18:18:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:18:11] * taplar holds back a 'to tha' joke
[18:31:12] <RottenCore> i’m getting an uncaught error
[18:31:13] <RottenCore> TypeError: m.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[18:31:19] <robertmaxrees> on your site?
[18:31:23] <RottenCore> yeah
[18:31:34] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landingtest2
[18:31:35] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're including the easings after jquery.
[18:31:53] <RottenCore> in the html you mean?
[18:31:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:32:28] <RottenCore> yeah it is
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> no 404 or anything on those files, too?
[18:32:49] <RottenCore> there is a 404, but it doesn’t tell me which file it is
[18:32:54] <RottenCore> I’m guessing that could be it too
[18:32:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:33:09] <RottenCore> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[18:33:16] <RottenCore> but doesn’t say which is the 404
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> are you on the network tab?
[18:34:03] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that'll tell you.
[18:35:11] <RottenCore> lemme take a look
[18:35:56] <RottenCore> my connection is slooooow
[18:36:35] <RottenCore> weird now there’s no 404
[18:36:35] <RottenCore> must have been my connection
[18:36:35] <RottenCore> still have the easing error though
[18:36:48] <robertmaxrees> right - are you getting a 404 on that js file?
[18:39:06] <RottenCore> not anymore
[18:39:12] <RottenCore> pretty sure that was just my connection
[18:39:41] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.  i'd have to see it fail.
[18:40:51] <RottenCore> brb. I’m switching coffee shops
[18:47:09] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/zpov4vdh/2/
[18:47:20] <RottenCore> it’s wierd. it works in jsfidde, but not on the site
[18:47:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's just the easing stuff then?
[18:48:32] <robertmaxrees> figured it out.
[18:48:37] <robertmaxrees> you're loading jquery twice.
[18:50:18] <RottenCore> oh?
[18:50:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:50:28] <RottenCore> lemme take a look
[18:50:43] <robertmaxrees> once in jquery.min.js and then a second time in jquery.js
[18:51:18] <RottenCore> i didn’t know taht would be a problem
[18:51:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:51:45] <robertmaxrees> the second one stomps all over the first.
[18:52:00] <RottenCore> lemme take the second out then
[18:55:25] <RottenCore> I take the one at the bottom out and it stops working entirely
[18:55:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:55:40] <robertmaxrees> new errors?
[18:55:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:56:06] <RottenCore> yup
[18:56:18] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you took out the first one.
[18:56:27] <robertmaxrees> the second one is still there.
[18:56:36] <robertmaxrees> kill <script src=js/jquery.js></script> - the one before bootstrap.
[18:57:10] <RottenCore> that’s the one I took out and it caused new error. just put it back.
[18:57:13] <RottenCore> but i’ll take it out again
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:57:19] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> you took out the other one.
[18:58:02] <robertmaxrees> oh woah your html is all funky, too.  missing tags and a doctype.
[18:58:20] <robertmaxrees> <!doctype html> <html>
[18:58:53] <RottenCore> yeah it was generated. I’m trying to get it to work then I’m going to clean it up
[18:59:02] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:59:05] <RottenCore> ok it’s out
[18:59:12] <robertmaxrees> there's literally no way to fix your js if your markup is that broken fwiw.
[18:59:38] <robertmaxrees> and I'm still seeing the second jq include but not the first.
[18:59:59] <RottenCore> that’s weird
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> make sure you leave the earlier one in there.
[19:00:23] <RottenCore> I commented it out
[19:00:24] <robertmaxrees> the one right before your "jquery time" block.
[19:01:00] <robertmaxrees> right now you don't have any copies running lol
[19:03:34] <RottenCore> ok hang on
[19:03:47] <RottenCore> yeah how did that happen? I didnt take them otu!
[19:03:48] <RottenCore> out, even
[19:04:48] <RottenCore> thanks! that worked
[19:04:54] <RottenCore> now I just have to figure out who the progress bar doesn't
[19:05:19] <RottenCore> check it out:
[19:05:26] <RottenCore> if you go through the form forward, nothing
[19:05:37] <RottenCore> but if you go a few pages thorugh it, then hit previous, it works
[19:05:41] <RottenCore> any idea what would be causing that?
[19:09:18] <lazyreader> excellent, my issue is caused by `$.extend(true, {}, out)`, where `out` is a deeply-nested backbone view that may contain circular references
[19:09:48] <lazyreader> but it only fails half the time because javascript is magic.
[19:10:04] <lazyreader> (fails == blows stack)
[19:13:26] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore that would tell me that your forward logic is broken.
[19:14:28] <robertmaxrees> $("#progressbar li").eq($("fieldset").index(next_fs)).addClass("active");
[19:14:38] <robertmaxrees> this looks weird.
[19:15:38] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: Yeah, thing is it’s not mine. I copy-pasted from here:
[19:15:47] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore if you link that page again... ;)
[19:15:52] <RottenCore> http://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Creating-A-Modern-Multi-Step-Form-with-jQuery-CSS3.html
[19:15:55] <robertmaxrees> long story short, all of this seems really strange.
[19:16:07] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to rework this to make it work.
[19:16:15] <RottenCore> ok. rework it how?
[19:16:44] <robertmaxrees> figure out where it's breaking?
[19:16:55] <robertmaxrees> you can use console.log and the debugger to figure that part out.
[19:17:45] <RottenCore> console’s showing no errors
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> wasn't saying there are errors...
[19:19:45] <RottenCore> i mean it’s now showing anything useful. heh
[19:19:54] <robertmaxrees> right, which is why you use console.log
[19:20:19] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i figured out the bug.
[19:20:25] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple problem.
[19:20:43] <robertmaxrees> looks like the squares should fill in one by one as they get filled in, right?
[19:20:54] <robertmaxrees> rather, as those form steps are completed.
[19:21:43] <RottenCore> right
[19:22:02] <robertmaxrees> take the "active" class off of all but the first step in your html.
[19:22:04] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[19:22:20] <robertmaxrees> the page you linked and the example page IT links are different.
[19:23:08] <RottenCore> ah that makes sense
[19:23:27] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com - i'd check this site out.
[19:24:34] <RottenCore> yup that did the trick
[19:24:42] <RottenCore> thanks man I really appreaciate it
[19:24:44] <RottenCore> it had been driving me nuts
[19:24:55] <robertmaxrees> sure - i'd hit up that site and learn.jquery.com
[19:25:32] <RottenCore> thing is I’m not really a devloper. not sure if I need too
[19:25:37] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:25:41] <RottenCore> I’m the guy who knows just enough to mess stuff up. haha
[19:25:43] <robertmaxrees> you're writing code.
[19:25:44] <RottenCore> that th eboss calls
[19:25:56] <robertmaxrees> that makes you a developer ;)
[19:26:00] <RottenCore> well ok. haha
[19:26:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, hire one :D
[19:26:04] <RottenCore> but not enough of one
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> then become more of one.
[19:26:23] <RottenCore> we actually had one, but his contract was up and he refused to fix a few things he left undone
[19:26:25] <RottenCore> this being one of them
[19:26:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[19:26:40] <robertmaxrees> he's smart.
[19:26:43] <taplar> :)
[19:27:18] <RottenCore> heh
[19:27:23] <RottenCore> back in a bit, need better wifi to finish this
[19:27:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a big problem for devel-
[19:27:32] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:31:53] <taplar> seems strange to me, though i guess i'm outside looking in, but i feel like if you have something that was developed, you need at least one committed developer to it on staff, :|
[19:32:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[19:32:15] <robertmaxrees> non-developers tend to not get that.
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> and then people like you and I end up doing work for them for free.
[19:39:03] <taplar> makes me wonder how many sites are going to be hit with a tinymce error, :)
[19:39:12] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[19:43:29] <taplar> i think our ux guy is wanting to replace it with summernote
[19:46:32] <illls> hey can I put a function, specifically sprintf, inside an object decleration, like var obj = {name:sprintf("text:%s",data.var)}
[19:46:48] <robertmaxrees> a function named sprintf?
[19:46:55] <illls> yeah
[19:47:10] <illls> its a text converter
[19:47:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:47:16] <robertmaxrees> a call to it or...?
[19:47:36] <illls> so the entry would be its return value
[19:48:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5avhdwn5/
[19:50:45] <taplar> sprintf makes me think of C
[19:51:41] <taplar> hah, yup
[20:34:20] <illls> hey i want to make a loop that goes through an array of objects that converts {type:"title",text:"description"} into the function call title("description") or should I just use a switch statement
[20:34:46] <illls> well actually more like .type(text)
[20:34:57] <taplar> what object does the method type belong to?
[20:35:47] <illls> they all belong to same one, so I have object and I want to loop through list of methods + text on a single object
[20:36:18] <illls> i can add switch case to look at each type and choose matching method
[20:36:38] <illls> but i'm wondering if I can/should use the object value to directly call the object method.
[20:36:48] <taplar> arrayOfObjects.map(function(index, element){ return parentObjectWithMethods[element.type](element.description); });
[20:36:52] <taplar> something like that
[20:37:03] <illls> yeah dude exactly, brilliant
[20:37:24] <taplar> well, if it's a true map, it'll be a little different
[20:37:39] <taplar> $.map( arrayOfObjects, function(index, element){ return parentObjectWithMethods[element.type](element.description); });
[20:38:05] <illls> yeah i wish i was good enough to type that all out even for exmaple, do you think this is ok approach to do something?
[20:38:19] <illls> and skip the type method checking?
[20:38:47] <taplar> not sure exactly what your doing to know if it is worth it
[20:39:15] <illls> ok, thanks for writing that out though, you're really smart!
[20:39:38] <taplar> there may be a syntax error with that last one so just fyi
[22:07:05] <djQuery1> is getDay not supposed to return 4 for the 1st of this month?
