[01:51:49] <delboy1978uk> I'm noticing that a jquery ui datepicker wont allow me to select the year when my form is in a bootstrap modal window, anyone experienced that before?
[01:52:27] <Cork> delboy1978uk: it is more likely that the bootstrap hooks does something
[01:54:58] <delboy1978uk> ah right ok what should i be looking for
[01:55:00] <delboy1978uk> ?
[01:56:57] <delboy1978uk> how do i test for that?
[02:21:13] <FilipNortic> does keypress fire on mouseevents?
[02:34:57] <_rgn> no it doesn't. it's a keyboard event
[02:46:22] <pollos> Hi, I have this error with dynatable: Uncaught DataCloneError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': An object could not be cloned. jquery.dynatable.js:847
[02:56:32] <pollos> nobody can help
[02:56:35] <pollos> ?
[02:56:37] <pollos> please
[02:57:43] <Cork> pollos: the debug the line in the file and inspect what object it throws on
[02:58:00] <Cork> and no, you most likely won't get an answer to that question
[02:58:04] <simpleuser> Hi there. Is there a way to put some html in a span that will be interprated? Something like $('span.icon-show-hide').text('<i class="icon-minus-sign-alt"></i>'); ?
[02:58:12] <Cork> it is very specific, and at the same time lacking a lot of info
[02:58:14] <simpleuser> interpreted*
[02:58:29] <Cork> simpleuser: s/.text/.html/
[02:59:15] <simpleuser> Cork: Thanks :)
[02:59:41] <pollos> the error come from here:         window.history[pushFunction](cache, "Dynatable state", path + params + hash);
[03:00:08] <Cork> pollos: check what cache is
[03:00:16] <pollos> and the author of dynatable said this:       // I have absolutely no idea why perPageOptions suddenly becomes an array-like object instead of an array,       // but just recently, this started throwing an error if I don't convert it:       // 'Uncaught Error: DATA_CLONE_ERR: DOM Exception 25'
[03:00:29] <pollos> ok i check
[03:01:30] <pollos> it's this cache:  cache.dynatable.dataset.perPageOptions = $.makeArray(cache.dynatable.dataset.perPageOptions);
[03:01:55] <Cork> so make sure that is something that can be cloned
[03:03:49] <pollos> I think it can because I didn't even touch to the file, it's the jquery.dynatable.js original file
[03:05:17] <prawnosun> Anyone know how to focus an input so that the cursor is always at position 0 index. For some odd reason, when I focus on an input that has a placeholder in it the cursor is at end of text.
[03:06:17] <prawnosun> something like $('input.foo').focus().charAt(0);
[03:06:34] <eigentor> I want to check a DOM Element if it has a certain child element, and if it does not, hide some other elements So far I got this $('.group-pd-tab-2').not(":has(.field-items)").remove();
[03:06:37] <pollos> Cork: I resolved the thing by putting pushState: false in the dynatable init, but I don't know if I need this pushstate
[03:06:53] <eigentor> this works fine for .group-pd-tab-2
[03:06:59] <Cork> prawnosun: you have to update the selection of the input field
[03:07:20] <prawnosun> Cork: umm what does that mean?
[03:07:23] <eigentor> but now I want to hide another element and It appears not to be possible to write a function call into the removes
[03:07:52] <eigentor> like removes(function(){ // do something else});
[03:08:06] <Cork> ?g javascript move cursor first input
[03:08:06] <b-ot> Cork: javascript - move cursor to the beginning of the input field? - Stack ... â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2127221/move-cursor-to-the-beginning-of-the-input-field
[03:08:20] <prawnosun> Cork: ok
[03:08:25] <eigentor> Maybe the .has() Method is not the right one for me?
[03:09:05] <Cork> eigentor: that won't really work
[03:09:38] <Cork> $('.group-pd-tab-2').not($('.field-items').closest('.group-pd-tab-2')).remove();
[03:09:41] <Cork> is prob your best option
[03:09:52] <Cork> eigentor: or move the selector up to the parent element
[03:10:01] <Cork> so you don't have to break the selector structure
[03:10:17] <eigentor> hm
[03:10:37] <eigentor> the thing is there is a tab with a li element that I gotta remove
[03:10:47] <eigentor> that is not quite near of the other element
[03:11:02] <eigentor> this works $('.group-pd-tab-2').not(":has(.field-items)").remove();
[03:11:12] <eigentor> but then how to trigger a function from that
[03:12:21] <eigentor> maybe I should not call the remove() but something else to begin with
[03:12:36] <eigentor> So I can hide multiple elements
[03:16:59] <eigentor> Maybe I try the contains() functioh
[03:18:18] <Elirips> Hello. Is it theoretically possible that two tabs send an ajax-request at exactly the same time? So the ?_=timestamp value that is appended by jquery if cache: false would be set to the same value?
[03:19:29] <Elirips> And, if that would be the case, could it be that the browser would just send only one request?
[03:27:31] <jmaister> It it theoretically possible
[03:28:34] <jmaister> Case: Have a JS send a request at time x, open two windows with said JS

[04:00:10] <Paradisee> hello
[04:00:28] <Paradisee> how can i load an entire json file into a var in js?
[04:00:47] <Paradisee> i already have the request via ajax that gives to me the json
[04:00:58] <Paradisee> now i need to put those data in another variable
[04:02:18] <_rgn> you have to return the data in a callback
[04:05:23] <dw1> ... success: function(data){ console.log(data); ... http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[04:06:34] <Paradisee> but already have a variable in this way:
[04:06:44] <Paradisee> var json_data = {};
[04:06:59] <Paradisee> i have to do something like json_data = json
[04:07:07] <Paradisee> where json is the file that i get via ajax
[04:07:28] <dw1> so put it in the success callback
[04:08:10] <Paradisee> dw1: yes, but what's the syntax?
[04:08:40] <dw1> instead of / in addition to console.log(data) as i showed above put json_data = data;
[04:09:02] <Paradisee> i tried, it didn't work :/
[04:09:22] <Paradisee> it keep saying: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'light_2' of undefined
[04:12:10] <djQuery> evidently you selector is not finding anything
[04:12:20] <djQuery> Paradisee, ^^
[04:12:28] <Paradisee> mmm ?
[04:12:46] <Paradisee> it does: Object {lights: Object}lights: Object__proto__: Object
[04:21:52] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/14/
[04:22:08] <prawnosun> cursor not at start
[04:24:08] <prawnosun> where are the experts when you need them :(
[04:24:20] <Cork> at lunch :)
[04:25:50] <Cork> prawnosun: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/15/
[04:26:16] <Cork> so the code works, except you tried to use the plugin before it was defined
[04:27:47] <prawnosun> Cork: Still cursor not at 0, when you run.
[04:27:57] <prawnosun> Cork: Only after you click it.
[04:28:03] <Cork> prawnosun: it is hard to solve that in jsfiddle
[04:28:08] <Cork> as focus is in another frame
[04:28:18] <Cork> so you can't see it before the window get focus
[04:28:23] <Cork> (the frames window)
[04:28:44] <Cork> so to illustrate that it works i moved it to click
[04:31:34] <prawnosun> Cork: works in IE when i do: foo(); function foo(){};
[04:31:55] <prawnosun> Cork: You say do function foo(){}; foo();
[04:31:55] <Cork> prawnosun: cause that is a declaration, not a statement
[04:32:11] <Cork> var foo = function() {}; vs function foo() {}
[04:32:39] <Cork> when you define plugins for jquery you do that through statements $.fn.<pluginanme> =
[04:32:44] <prawnosun> Firstly, when do i use one over the another? in above
[04:32:47] <Cork> so they arn't hoisted
[04:33:11] <Cork> prawnosun: the later is mainly when you want to send the function off to somewhere else
[04:33:24] <Cork> prawnosun: the first when you want to run it where you define it
[04:33:33] <Cork> though nothing prevents you from always using the later one
[04:33:52] <prawnosun> I get error when trying to convert it to the later
[04:34:07] <Cork> convert what to the later?
[04:34:25] <prawnosun> $.fn.<pluginanme> = function()
[04:34:31] <prawnosun> to:
[04:34:34] <Cork> that is already the later
[04:35:01] <Cork> <pluginanme> = function() {}; <-- statement
[04:35:11] <Cork> function <pluginanme>() {}; <-- declaration
[04:36:19] <prawnosun> you referring the statement as the later?
[04:36:29] <Cork> the former
[04:36:33] <prawnosun> lol
[04:36:42] <Cork> when you give the value of the function to a variable
[04:36:48] <Cork> your assiging the value == statement
[04:36:59] <Cork> when you define a function, it has a name
[04:37:19] <Cork> function definitions is hoisted in javascript (executes before the rest of the code is parsed)
[04:37:39] <prawnosun> so with a statement it must be defined/listed first before it can be called?
[04:37:53] <Cork> for example if(false) { function a() { return 1; } } a() will return 1
[04:38:16] <Cork> js> if(false) { function a() { return 1; } } print(a())
[04:38:19] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:38:38] <Cork> ah, right they changed that to a parser error didn't they
[04:39:48] <Cork> prawnosun: a variable must have its value before you can expect the value in the variable
[04:39:52] <Cork> its as simple as that
[04:40:08] <prawnosun> so thats a yes to my question
[04:40:14] <Cork> yes
[04:40:21] <Cork> just like any normal variable
[04:40:40] <prawnosun> why can't i convert a statement to a declaration?
[04:40:46] <Cork> var a = false; if(a) { /* won't run as a is false */ } a = true;
[04:40:57] <Cork> it would be strange if that if case saw a == true
[04:41:25] <Cork> prawnosun: you can, but the variable won't have the value
[04:41:39] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/20/
[04:41:39] <Cork> cause the assignment of the value to the variable is a statement
[04:42:36] <Cork> prawnosun: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/21/
[04:43:13] <Cork> you can't get it onto the jquery prototype without assigning it to a property on it though
[04:43:19] <Cork> and that demands a statement
[04:43:32] <Cork> opps missed the this at the end
[04:43:36] <Cork> should have been return t;
[04:45:44] <prawnosun> so that one must be a statement?
[04:46:00] <Cork> if you want it on $.fn yes
[04:46:05] <Cork> you need to assign it onto it
[04:46:31] <Cork> basically "variable = value" is a statement
[04:47:03] <prawnosun> yes
[04:47:52] <prawnosun> anyway, i left it as a statement, its now above and before the variable is called. still no cursor at 0
[04:47:57] <prawnosun> in chrome
[04:50:07] <Cork> prawnosun: http://fiddle.jshell.net/Lpnsnhpx/22/show/
[04:50:10] <Cork> works fine here
[04:50:27] <Cork> but like i said before, you can't force focus to the frame inside jsfiddle
[04:50:38] <Cork> or force the browser to get focus if the user has focused another program
[04:51:50] <prawnosun> Cork: im getting a strange behaviour with placeholder in chrome where it doesn't set cursor to 0 but will in IE
[05:04:22] <prawnosun> apparently, input type email does not support it
[05:04:42] <prawnosun> setselectionrage
[05:24:27] <prawnosun> Cork: run on chrome console mode http://fiddle.jshell.net/Lpnsnhpx/23/show/
[05:26:42] <Cork> prawnosun: ok
[05:31:22] <prawnosun> Cork: IE will complain, but it actually works, but not in chrome.
[05:31:41] <Cork> prawnosun: and it states why
[05:31:46] <Cork> not much you can do about it
[05:32:51] <prawnosun> Cork: Basically you can't gaurantee cursor 0 with input type email
[05:33:09] <prawnosun> How dumb is that
[05:33:21] <Cork> file a bug
[05:33:43] <prawnosun> it seems it has been filed many times
[05:33:52] <prawnosun> still not fixed.
[05:39:32] <emacsen> I notice that when I use jquery to post an object in json, it comes to the server like 'actions[0][args][]':  instead of copying the lists, etc. Is there a way to get jquery to post a deeper serialization?
[05:47:26] <Cork> emacsen: that is how it is expected to be serialized
[05:47:40] <Cork> emacsen: and you arn't sending json
[05:47:52] <Cork> your sending an object/array that gets converted to params
[05:48:10] <Cork> emacsen: the solution is to convert the object/array to json before you send it
[05:48:40] <emacsen> Cork, so when I do that  using JSON.serializze, what comes out the other end, on my node server, is what looks like a string
[05:48:49] <Cork> JSON.stringify
[05:49:12] <Cork> emacsen: you need to set the content-type to json
[05:49:24] <Cork> instead of www-encode-form
[05:49:29] <Kartagis> is the only use of minified versions reduced waiting time?
[05:49:55] <emacsen> Cork,             dataType: "json",  doesn't set the content type on post?
[05:50:00] <Cork> Kartagis: and memory usage
[05:50:03] <Cork> no
[05:50:11] <Cork> that sets the accept header to json
[05:50:16] <Kartagis> okay
[05:50:21] <Cork> meaning you ask the server "please send me json back"
[05:50:31] <Cork> the server can ignore that and send what ever it like if it wants to
[05:50:46] <emacsen> Cork, I'm talking about the server receiving and parsing it as json
[05:51:18] <Cork> emacsen: that is controlled by the content-type
[05:51:20] <Cork> not accept
[05:51:20] <emacsen> the server doesn't actually need to send anything back. This is a fire and forget api call
[05:51:40] <Cork> $.ajax(url { contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify() })
[05:51:48] <Cork> opps missed a comma
[05:51:52] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify() })
[05:52:16] <emacsen> Cork, okay, let me try that. Thanks
[05:53:40] <emacsen> Cork, perfect! Thank you! I'd have spent who-knows-how-long on that!
[06:08:57] <sprihodko> Hi. Using select2 and want to have one default option instead of 'No matches found' text. I tried it like this http://pastie.org/9631032 but i don't want to trigger it once no matches found. I want to default option appear instead of text
[06:17:08] <Lebbe> $('form').is(':hidden') returns true the form has the style rule "display: inline"
[06:17:17] <Lebbe> is this a bug or a feature?
[06:17:26] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/8w22tgao/
[06:17:36] <Lebbe> in safari and chrome, but not in firefox.
[06:20:23] <Cork> meaning in webkit but not in gecko
[06:20:26] <Cork> what does ie do?
[06:23:26] <Cork> Lebbe: http://jsfiddle.net/8w22tgao/2/
[06:23:30] <Cork> i suspect that is the reason
[06:23:44] <Cork> opps
[06:23:47] <Cork> wrong link
[06:24:33] <Lebbe> since the behaviour is differnet in firefox and safari/chrome I reported it as a bug
[06:24:44] <Lebbe> didn't see any related bugs in the bug tracker
[06:25:28] <Cork> Lebbe: http://jsfiddle.net/8w22tgao/3/
[06:25:39] <Cork> Lebbe: looks like display: inline is invalid in webkit
[06:25:53] <Cork> so it reverts to display: ""
[06:25:55] <cybertron> hi, I try a search with ajax my problem is after every key hit I call a ajax call but I want a call only, if I know the exact search word eg. "smith" and not after every changed key
[06:26:15] <Lebbe> that is absolutely not correct, at least not in my chrome
[06:26:24] <Cork> Lebbe: use inline-block instead
[06:26:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8w22tgao/4/
[06:26:50] <Lebbe> console.log($('.theForm').css('display')); returns "inline" in my chrome browser
[06:26:52] <Cork> Lebbe: chromes dome throws out display: inline for form elements
[06:26:56] <Cork> that is why it breaks
[06:27:04] <Lebbe> and "inline" is a perfectly valid css rule
[06:27:14] <Cork> Lebbe: $('.theForm')[0].style.display == ''
[06:27:14] <cybertron> so I need a possibility to identify when a search word is complete like "if no key pressed since 2 seconds" -> search
[06:27:21] <Lebbe> but it perhaps isnt valid for the form-tag?
[06:27:36] <Cork> it isn't in webkit but it is in firefox
[06:27:39] <Cork> sorry gecko
[06:27:47] <Cork> that is why you get the difference in behavior
[06:27:53] <Cork> so, not a jquery bug
[06:28:03] <cybertron> I tried it with setTimout but thats not the answer, so I get also 10 request for 10keys pressed
[06:28:09] <Cork> it is a browser compatibility bug
[06:28:25] <Cork> for either webkit or gecko (most likely depending on what trident does)
[06:29:17] <Lebbe> well
[06:29:48] <Lebbe> if the bug appears when not following the standard, I should just get this dev-team to follow the standard instead of nagging at jquery :)
[06:29:59] <Lebbe> thank you for the help, Cork
[06:30:12] <Cork> Lebbe: the standard might just not have defined this case
[06:30:20] <Lebbe> well
[06:30:27] <Cork> and normally they change standards now days to match the majority of the browsers
[06:30:32] <Cork> + engines
[06:30:34] <Lebbe> block-elements within inline-elements is nasty, I dont think it is "legal" in the standard
[06:30:48] <Cork> it wasn't in previous standards
[06:30:53] <Cork> it is allowed in html
[06:31:13] <Lebbe> it is?
[06:31:14] <Lebbe> well
[06:31:39] <Lebbe> I think it sounds like something is wrong when a form gets the style rule "display: inline" either way
[06:31:39] <Cork> inline won't ever have any padding or margins though
[06:31:44] <Lebbe> I just removed that style rule
[06:32:21] <Cork> ya, that doesn't really make sense
[06:39:10] <Cork> Lebbe: lovely, ie always returns '' for forms
[06:39:16] <Cork> have fun :P
[06:39:28] <Lebbe> haha
[06:40:32] <Horacsio> hi
[06:58:49] <FilipNortic> can I make something trigger on an Iframe closing?
[07:01:27] <FilipNortic> nevermind
[07:03:21] <Cork> FilipNortic: closing??
[07:20:42] <Erwat> is the usage of iframes frowned upon?
[07:20:56] <Cork> no
[07:21:04] <Cork> for some use cases it is the only solution
[07:21:12] <Cork> though it makes some tasks harder
[07:24:41] <Erwat> i just wrote two download tests: serial vs parallel requests and figured i should put them together and iframes make it really easy
[07:24:54] <Erwat> and was wondering if i showed this to someone will they laugh me out of the room
[07:26:30] <Erwat> is there a way to get around image caching?
[07:27:02] <Erwat> as in make the browser not cache images that i could force from code -- i don't think adding "?rand=" + Math.random() is quite enough
[07:27:09] <Cork> Erwat: append a unique value at the end of the url
[07:27:45] <Horacsio> hi again
[07:27:46] <phx> Erwat, or set the cache headers properly?
[07:28:01] <Erwat> phx: i don't know anything about how that's done. thank you for the tip. i'll look into it
[07:28:09] <Erwat> Cork: well, i am not certain this works  but maybe it does
[07:28:21] <phx>         header('Cache-Control' => 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate');
[07:28:22] <Horacsio> Iâ€™ve manage to make some working jsfiddle and now, in the page it doesnâ€™t work :( can someone help me figure this out?http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/co47Lwtg/9/
[07:28:23] <phx> from my perl code
[07:28:35] <phx> Erwat, but this is server-side
[07:29:19] <Cork> Erwat: '?_=' + Date.now() is quite common
[07:29:50] <Erwat> yeah i know but since i'll be doing 50 requests where only one line is separating them i am not sure if those will be different enough which is why i went with Math.random() as i said earlier
[07:30:48] <phx> Erwat, well, you can do a uri + '?' + (++i); as well, that'll also avoid accidentally getting same results from random
[07:32:12] <Erwat> yep, but since i am using two iframes now ++i might not be that great
[07:32:38] <phx> Erwat, '?'+frameid + (++i)
[07:33:00] <phx> Erwat, but it reminds me a classic, "return 4; // garanteed to be random, choosen by a fair dice roll" :)
[07:33:50] <Erwat> anyways i just didn't know that "?rand=" + Math.random()
[07:33:57] <Erwat> would be enough, i figured it might be i wasn't sure
[07:34:05] <Erwat> if it is then what i put there isn't really a problem
[07:39:57] <Lebbe> from today all our end-users get a message to upgrade their browsers when using IE9 and below
[07:40:02] <Lebbe> jquery 2.* here we come :D
[07:40:17] <Cork> heh
[07:41:13] <Horacsio> anyone?
[07:42:12] <LiENUS> i'm using $.ajax() to pull some xml and then using $(xml).find() to parse it and getting the values of each entity with row.find('name').text() but i'm having a problem in that its processing the escaped entities so that &amp; becomes & which once i load into the html isnt properly escaped
[07:42:23] <LiENUS> how can i stop it from parsing those entities?
[07:45:22] <Horacsio> I need to implement this: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/co47Lwtg/10/  on this page: http://baannng.com/on/ but somehow the divs dont fade and overflow instead :(
[07:46:31] <uskerine> hi, how text is added to a <span></span> tag?
[07:47:02] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $('span').text('Some Text'); ?
[07:47:15] <uskerine> thanks
[07:47:15] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Does the HTML have to be formatted like this?
[07:47:20] <uskerine> I was stuck at val
[07:47:42] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Ah, plenty of people make that mistake. That's only for input elements.
[07:48:01] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: yes, I need it that way :S
[07:48:08] <BillCriswell> Any ops here? queorgullo is spamming.
[07:49:23] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: do you have any idea on whyâ€™s that haappening? :(
[07:49:39] <Horacsio> ahahahahah queorgulho :D:D:D:D:D:D
[07:50:59] <Kristina> i updated jquery and it broke something and i don't know what.
[07:51:22] <Kristina> my click even handler seems to be calling a function in a weird way.
[07:51:26] <Kristina> event*
[07:53:10] <BillCriswell> Kristina: Have a link?
[07:53:15] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: One minute.
[07:53:21] <Horacsio> sure :)
[07:54:22] <Horacsio> I found the issue!
[07:54:37] <Horacsio> it was related to jquery ui :(
[07:54:43] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: http://jsfiddle.net/co47Lwtg/11/ is how I'd approach the problem sine the HTML is gross.
[07:56:00] <Horacsio> let me check with your kind example :)
[07:56:01] <Kristina> oh, i don't think jquery broke it.
[07:56:04] <Kristina> i think i broke it.
[07:56:21] <BillCriswell> Kristina: Haha
[07:56:26] <BillCriswell> Kristina: Any errors in the console?
[07:56:56] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: I dont need that css for content, right?
[07:57:08] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: No.
[07:57:21] <BillCriswell> It was just there so I knew .wrapAll was doing what I planned.
[07:57:27] <Horacsio> ;)
[08:00:38] <Kristina> Yeah, there were.
[08:00:51] <Kristina> I thought jquery method binding was doing something weird.
[08:01:05] <BillCriswell> Ah, glad you got it figured out.
[08:02:32] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: TypeError: jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[08:02:43] <Horacsio> why is this breaking? :(
[08:02:47] <Horacsio> have any idea?
[08:03:00] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11533168/jquery-easingjquery-easing-def-is-not-a-function
[08:03:40] <Horacsio> so this is a bug for the jquery ui?
[08:04:33] <Horacsio> because Iâ€™m using CDN for the min.js â€¦
[08:05:44] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: I have no idea without seeing things working together.
[08:06:01] <Horacsio> http://baannng.com/on/
[08:07:44] <Horacsio> I changed the min version to the full version for jquery ui
[08:11:16] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.js this link 404s
[08:11:24] <Cork> Horacsio: min is just a minified version of the full
[08:11:26] <BillCriswell> brb.
[08:11:36] <Cork> it still have all the same features as the other one
[08:11:42] <Cork> so that isn't the problem
[08:12:09] <Horacsio> ok
[08:13:21] <Horacsio> I using an older version of jquery ui :S
[08:22:42] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: thank you for the help
[08:47:15] <Scriptonaut> could someone tell me a common drag/drop even used in jQuery (for images). I am pretty sure I know the problem on this rails app, images are getting uploaded twice, because of event bubbling. However I need to tracking down the file that has the event binding. If I know a few common triggers I can git grep and probably find it
[08:49:59] <mbrzuzy> guys, I have an odd firefox problem
[08:50:19] <mbrzuzy> When adding a class to the body with jQuery on hover that affects styles, certiain CSS transitions don't animte
[08:50:24] <mbrzuzy> animate*
[08:50:33] <mbrzuzy> and the elements just display rather than fade
[08:54:45] <droid909> is ther something like moments.js but for php and with different languages support?
[09:13:09] <alexclark> general question: if I am writing a file that just attached event handlers, is it always appropriate to wrap it in $(function() { ... });?
[09:13:21] <alexclark> *attaches
[09:13:23] <robertmaxrees> alexclark depends - generally, yes
[09:13:36] <robertmaxrees> that waits for the document to be ready before doing anything.
[09:13:49] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: whats the logic on the decision?
[09:14:19] <robertmaxrees> if you put your JS in the <head>, the page's content doesn't yet exist.
[09:14:51] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing to bind to yet
[09:15:03] <alexclark> ok, so in the head it needs the document load, in the footer is can live without?
[09:15:11] <robertmaxrees> *document ready.
[09:15:18] <robertmaxrees> and basically, yes.
[09:15:21] <alexclark> oh ok
[09:15:25] <alexclark> sweet, thanks!
[09:15:31] <robertmaxrees> the other thing that wrap does is scopes some variables for you.
[09:15:36] <robertmaxrees> if you properly declare them
[09:21:51] <MarkyC> I have a jquery change event that occurs when a select is changed. If I dynamically create a new select (with jquery), how can I set it's change event to the existing one?
[09:22:11] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[09:22:44] <jakey> robert that's starting to become your catchphrase
[09:22:50] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[09:23:02] <robertmaxrees> because it's so useful.  and it fixes like 75% of the problems i see.
[09:23:05] <Scriptonaut> can someone please help me figure out where the hell in my code a certain event is bound?
[09:23:07] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:23:18] <Scriptonaut> I /know/ the problem with this code, I just don't know where the code is
[09:23:30] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut sure - paste the code up somewhere and we can look.
[09:23:40] <jakey> post code, receive criticism
[09:23:43] <Scriptonaut> it's tens of thousands of lines of code
[09:24:05] <robertmaxrees> okay, then how would you like us to help?
[09:24:07] <Scriptonaut> I have a drag image and drop it upload thing (I didn't write it)
[09:24:25] <Scriptonaut> I want to find the names of classes/ids that the events for drag/drop are bound to
[09:24:30] <Scriptonaut> so I can git grep the codebase
[09:24:33] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: so my current code is $('.my-select').change(function() { /* do stuff */ }); Should I remove the anonymous function (let's call it doStuff()), then do $('.my-select').on('change', doStuff()) after adding the new .my-select element to the page?
[09:24:35] <Scriptonaut> and find out exactly where they're defined like that
[09:25:07] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC no - do $('.some-parent').on('change', '.my-select', function() {});
[09:25:21] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: or do I get that functionality 'for free' if I use $('.my-select').on('change', function() { /* do stuff */ }); ?
[09:25:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:25:32] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC where some-parent is an ancestor of that element that you're adding that exists on pageload.
[09:25:39] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: I see now
[09:25:46] <MarkyC> So I attach the event to a parent
[09:25:52] <robertmaxrees> .change(function() {}) is just a shortcut to .on('change', function() {})
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> if you attach you listener to a parent element, you'll catch the even when it bubbles up through the document.
[09:26:18] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: That makes sense. Thank you!
[09:26:34] <ljdevs> why does while (0<10) { item.preprendTo(container); } only prepend the item twice?
[09:26:44] <ljdevs> ^ i++
[09:26:51] <ljdevs> i<10*
[09:27:17] <jakey> need a little more context there ljdevs
[09:27:21] <ljdevs> one sec
[09:27:28] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be awesome for that one.
[09:28:27] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut i'd search for the beginning of the various binding methods - '.on(', '.click(', etc.
[09:28:38] <hwamokp66> Some of my sections are going underneath other sections on mobile instead of being laid out one by one like on my lapotp. What's my issue here? http://mobiletest.me/nokia_lumia_920_emulator/#u=http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/#partners
[09:29:33] <MarkyC> >> var i = 0; while(i < 10) { console.log(i+ ' '); i++;  }
[09:29:50] <MarkyC> errrr. maybe there is no ecmabot in this channel :/
[09:30:08] <robertmaxrees> nope. we have a bot, but it's not ecmabot.
[09:30:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jkt3Ls5s/
[09:32:27] <jakey> why no use a for loop? :P
[09:33:31] <robertmaxrees> while loops are faster
[09:33:34] <jakey> also should do ''+i
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> implicit type conversion ftl
[09:34:09] <ljdevs> https://gist.github.com/ljdevs/f5012a8c974816c2830f
[09:34:27] <jakey> I can't imagine using a while loop is bringing you any benefit the readability of a for loop isn't worth x_x
[09:35:31] <ljdevs> didn't know the difference actually, Ill try that
[09:35:32] <robertmaxrees> ljdevs so this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/makoxfzp/
[09:35:41] <robertmaxrees> because you're moving the same copy of the element.
[09:35:52] <jakey> ^ &lol
[09:35:57] <ljdevs> yes robertmaxrees
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly clone the element each time instead.
[09:36:13] <ljdevs> So how would I  get the results I wanted?
[09:36:15] <hwamokp66> Some of my sections are going underneath other sections on mobile instead of being laid out one by one like on my lapotp. What's my issue here? http://mobiletest.me/nokia_lumia_920_emulator/#u=http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/#partners
[09:36:16] <ljdevs> Oh
[09:36:23] <jakey> put the clone in the loop
[09:36:28] <robertmaxrees> not like that.
[09:36:30] <ljdevs> ahhh
[09:36:34] <robertmaxrees> that'll clone the class every time.
[09:36:42] <robertmaxrees> and then you'll get this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/makoxfzp/1/
[09:37:05] <robertmaxrees> do something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/makoxfzp/2/
[09:37:52] <ljdevs> thanks!
[09:38:36] <jakey> now you'll get the preligious argument of child.prependTo(parent) vs parent.prepend(child)
[09:38:48] <robertmaxrees> nah not really.
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> all depends on whatever is best in that partcular case ;)
[09:39:04] <jakey> but what are we without pedantry
[09:39:11] <robertmaxrees> not ##javascript?
[09:40:08] <jakey> xD http:/list-of-burn-centers
[09:40:46] <robertmaxrees> we get our fair share of some of that here.  i'm guilty of it.  but they get into some really crazy debates over there.
[09:50:31] <hwamokp66> Some of my sections are going underneath other sections on mobile instead of being laid out one by one like on my lapotp. What's my issue here? http://mobiletest.me/nokia_lumia_920_emulator/#u=http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/#partners
[09:51:48] <jakey> I hate to say it but there's a ton of layout problems on desktop too :P
[09:52:09] <hwamokp66> jakey: such as?
[09:52:37] <jakey> startup weekend - media - contact if position: absollute over the scrolling content and had no background
[09:53:07] <jakey> hovering over things sometimes makes them go slightly offscreen
[09:53:44] <jakey> the box next to Adams Outdoor Advertising is really wonky
[09:54:04] <jakey> for reference my screen is in portrait mode
[09:55:03] <hwamokp66> jakey: oh the iframe was just testing for somethign else, i forgot to take it out. What did you mean about the position pt? anyway you could take a screenshot?
[09:57:33] <jakey> http://imgur.com/MQUY9D2
[09:58:54] <hwamokp66> jakey: what device are you using?
[10:00:11] <jakey>  Google Chrome 37.0.2062.120 (Official Build 281580)  OS Linux
[10:00:33] <jakey> im on debian on a desktop
[10:01:17] <jakey> the broswer window is currently about 1055px wide
[10:02:10] <hwamokp66> jakey: that's erally weird. I'll look into that as well. Any input for why the mobile is even more severely screwed up? It's like overlapping at sections so half of the sections aren't visible
[10:02:53] <jakey> I couldn't tell I didn't look at your css, i'd check if mediaqueries are doing something funky
[10:03:54] <Desode> I'm dealing with a function that works great in jQuery 1.5, but doesn't work at all in more recent versions of jQuery (1.7 and up) Does anyone have an idea what could be wrong? The code is available here: http://pastebin.com/XWA8ZKRz
[10:04:27] <jakey> you scared me, that looked like PHP
[10:06:25] <Desode> That might have something to do with the fact that it's a broken Drupal module
[10:06:36] <Desode> Or rather, one that only breaks with newer versions of jQuery.
[10:08:33] <Horacsio> doug_: hi. iâ€™ve made thing :) with some help :)
[10:09:00] <doug_> Horacsio: hi
[10:09:05] <doug_> nice
[10:09:59] <Horacsio> I dig about the subject and found a very simple way to do it. simple to me :D
[10:10:29] <Horacsio> I stoped the fades, since Iâ€™m not into it anymore. donâ€™t have the time to apply to all websiteâ€¦
[10:11:54] <doug_> Horacsio: ok
[10:11:55] <cj> moo
[10:12:18] <cj> so, $('#listing-actions .button') just selects the class="button" elements under #listing-actions, right?
[10:12:38] <doug_> cj: right, anywhere under
[10:13:07] <cj> okay, but this should not select #foo .button if #foo is not under #listing-actions, right?
[10:13:09] <doug_> cj: potentially with several parents between listing-actions and the buttons
[10:13:27] <cj> yeah, that's peachy.  so long as it doesn't go to #listing-action's neighbor #foo
[10:13:32] <doug_> the buttons are immediate children of #listing-actions?
[10:13:36] <cj> I wonder why #foo's .button elements are getting hidden...
[10:13:45] <cj> they are, but I might put something in between at some point
[10:13:58] <Horacsio> and you see Iâ€™ve fixed the links in terms of tabstops too :)
[10:14:12] <doug_> if you wanted to restrict to direct children, it would be #listing-actions > .button
[10:14:31] <doug_> fyi
[10:14:59] <cj> yeah, I thought that was the syntax for that.  thanks.
[10:15:23] <doug_> cj: one more thing that might help: bring up your page that you are working on and enter selectors in the debugger console
[10:15:29] <doug_> you can try out selectors there
[10:15:57] <cj> yup, I've done that before.  I'm guessing the problem is in the resize handler maybe
[10:49:34] <dlam> hey if i do  $('#thing').blah()  and  $('#thing').foo()    ...does jquery do the selector stuff twice?  or does it like have some optimization so it only does it once?
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> dlam it runs it twice.
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> two separate objects.
[10:50:11] <dlam> thx thx
[10:50:17] <robertmaxrees> if you instead of var $thing = $('#thing');  and instead of $this, you'll avoid the extra lookups.

[11:17:40] <BillCriswell> beforeSend's first callback isn't an event, it's a jqXHR thing.
[11:18:06] <BillCriswell> Scriptonaut: ^
[11:18:34] <Scriptonaut> hmm, so whoever wrote this code incorrectly called it: e
[11:18:41] <Scriptonaut> e is not an event?
[11:18:45] <arthurvr> BillCriswell is correct. stopPropagation() is a method on event arguments
[11:18:49] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[11:19:54] <Scriptonaut> oh, well thanks
[11:20:03] <BillCriswell> No problemoooooo

[11:34:47] <cuba_libre__> Hello people.
[11:34:52] <cuba_libre__> What are your working on today?
[11:35:56] <droid909> cuba_libre__: bad
[11:36:16] <cuba_libre__> bad?
[11:36:21] <droid909> cuba_libre__: we a working bad today
[11:36:23] <droid909> are
[11:36:24] <droid909> damn
[11:37:05] <cuba_libre__> Why is that?
[11:38:30] <cuba_libre__> Is this place always this dead?
[11:40:02] <Uhkis> no
[11:41:22] <robertmaxrees> not relly.
[11:41:34] <robertmaxrees> *really.  goes through phases.
[11:42:32] <cuba_libre__> I see. Frankly I am surprised so many people are in here.
[11:42:40] <robertmaxrees> why is that?
[11:43:15] <cuba_libre__> 830 folks is a lot. The topic seems quite niche - jQuery isn't exactly a mainstream topic.
[11:43:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a highly used javascript library.
[11:43:51] <robertmaxrees> plus this is for jquery mobile and jquery ui support, too.
[11:44:43] <Respek> plus, IRC is home to a lot of technical people in the 1st place, so jquery users would percentage wise by uniquely high
[11:44:50] <cuba_libre__> I don't complain. I think it's really nice.
[11:45:10] <robertmaxrees> lots of smart folks in here, too.
[11:45:17] <cuba_libre__> I just never really used IRC. Last time I connected was around 10 years ago. It's nice to see there are plenty of knowledgeable people online.
[11:45:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i had a similar experience.  freenode is a great place.
[11:49:04] <cuba_libre__> So any other rooms you could recommend?
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're interested in.  We're kind of sticklers for ontopic communications.
[11:49:29] <robertmaxrees> *conversations.
[11:50:23] <cuba_libre__> Any  good webdev related rooms?
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> ##frontend is all about frontend tooling and stuff.  iirc there's a ##web, ##html, and #css
[11:51:27] <cuba_libre__> Thanks.
[11:53:34] <robertmaxrees> there's also a generic ##javascript channel if you're inclined.  that's more about core language, but they like to get into pretty deep discussions/arguments about some stuff sometimes.
[11:56:33] <cuba_libre__> Thanks again.
[12:03:35] <daynaskully> {Q} how can i have the jquery.click() event work on a mobile device?

[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:06:04] <robertmaxrees> that should help for now.
[12:06:17] <Jardayn> whats the problem with him being a bot?
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> they were spamming people.
[12:06:24] <daynaskully> yea as soon as i asked the question; BAM private message with a link
[12:06:47] <robertmaxrees> didn't see them in here earlier, but I got hit by them with a free camshow link.
[12:06:51] <faddah> thanx for handling that, robertmaxrees.
[12:06:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:08:03] <Jardayn> ah
[12:08:07] <Jardayn> this is where they came from
[12:08:30] <robertmaxrees> Jardayn hrm?
[12:08:40] <Jardayn> i had someone whisper me with a sketchy link
[12:08:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.

[12:37:22] <usc911> hey guys, anyone know how to trigger a button click on document ready? I have a trigger to click the button but it seems to loop and keep clicking!
[12:39:49] <usc911> ah, set a timeout
[12:42:31] <boxbeatsy> hi, i'm trying to jquery fadeOut a div that includes a paragraph element and a blockquote element.  the paragraph element is fading out properly but not the blockquote.  does anyone know where i could be going wrong?
[12:42:42] <boxbeatsy> the blockquote element simply waits for the fadetime to run otu and then hides all at once
[12:52:09] <boxbeatsy> anyone? :\
[12:54:19] <thinkxl> boxbeatsy: create a test case in jsfiddle
[12:54:44] <rmill> ?paste @ boxbeatsy
[12:54:44] <b-ot> boxbeatsy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:00:12] <xckpd7> why people prefer jsfiddle.net over codepen?
[13:03:00] <boxbeatsy> thinkxl: ok here we go - http://jsfiddle.net/s4f0xem3/
[13:03:53] <boxbeatsy> so, basically, i'm wondering why the blockquote doesn't fade in and out when the span does
[13:08:19] <simmelj> I've spent my entire debugging an issue where a call to $.ajax() causes a page refresh. Tried searching through bug trackers and the Googles without success. Basically it happens when I set a custom Authorization header. I can see the browser making the request and receiving a response. But before my callback is called the page is reloaded. This does not happen with a vanilla XMLHttpRequest with the same headers. It's a CORS request. Anyon
[13:08:36] <Ajkthx> your entire..?
[13:08:46] <Ajkthx> day? week? month?
[13:08:58] <Ajkthx> what amount of time did you spend entirely? i'm dying to know
[13:09:20] <simmelj> day! :D
[13:09:31] <Ajkthx> oh ok
[13:09:39] <simmelj> So not too bad. ;P
[13:09:40] <Ajkthx> well i don't know anything about jquery so, good luck
[13:10:02] <simmelj> kthx
[13:10:18] <thinkxl> boxbeatsy: man that example is awful, no indented code, no comments, you need to make it easier for others to helpp you
[13:10:48] <thinkxl> I won't be able to help you, sorry
[13:11:13] <dmsuperman> simmelj: what's the question?
[13:11:30] <simmelj> dmsuperman: what am I doing wrong and why is the page reloaded?
[13:11:42] <simmelj> Also the last thing I wrote was a question... ;)
[13:12:00] <dmsuperman> "This does not happen with a vanilla XMLHttpRequest with the same headers. It's a CORS request. Anyon
[13:12:07] <dmsuperman> that's how your comment ends
[13:12:16] <simmelj> Oh.. weird cutoff. I can see it all here.
[13:12:20] <simmelj> "Anyone experience a similar thing or know what might be up?"
[13:13:39] <dmsuperman> that sounds like the a reasonable experience, no? you need to authenticate right? I imagine the browser hijacks it to force the login?
[13:14:03] <simmelj> It's OAuth. And also, why does that not happen with vanilla XMLHttpRequest in that case?
[13:14:10] <boxbeatsy> sorry thinkxl! here is prettier code: http://jsfiddle.net/s4f0xem3/2/
[13:14:37] <simmelj> Never sounds reasonable to me tha the browser would refresh (not even redirect) as the result of an AJAX request..
[13:14:40] <dmsuperman> Oh, I thought you meant HTTP authentication
[13:14:54] <simmelj> No, I'm setting a Hawk token
[13:14:55] <dmsuperman> in which case it would have to present the HTTP auth interface
[13:15:01] <simmelj> Right
[13:15:10] <dmsuperman> are you sure there's nothing else doing the refreshing
[13:15:35] <dmsuperman> can you repeat the issue in a fiddle for example
[13:15:49] <simmelj> Yup. I boiled it down to one $.ajax()-call. If I remove that nothing refreshes.
[13:15:52] <simmelj> I could try
[13:16:05] <boxbeatsy> i'm trying to make a div fade in and out.  the div consists of a blockquote and a span element.  the span element is fading properly, but not the blockquote.  anyone know where i might be going wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/s4f0xem3/2/
[13:17:13] <simmelj> dmsuperman: This is the header I'm setting: AuthorizationHawk id="Fe26.2*3**QdLGklR2HYo", ts="1412799379", nonce="7OGNMi", mac="3CikqIfSzhy+OgplKQk2P4ZI5GMIPWn1o8/A="
[13:17:19] <simmelj> (truncated)
[13:17:39] <simmelj> ALso with a space and a colon
[13:18:17] <dmsuperman> need a fiddle to isolate the issue
[13:18:28] <thinkxl> boxbeatsy: http://jsfiddle.net/s4f0xem3/3/
[13:18:53] <simmelj> dmsuperman: Sure. I'll try.. not sure how to reproduce the CORS-thing though. Since I don't have any production servers running for this yet..
[13:20:27] <dmsuperman> hrm, not sure there actually. you could presumably spin up a linode / similar VM with pro-rating and it would only cost a buck or two... or run it on your home connection and forward the port
[13:20:51] <boxbeatsy> thinkxl: thank you!
[13:21:02] <thinkxl> boxbeatsy: np
[13:26:20] <simmelj> dmsuperman: thanks for the help attempt. I'll see if I can get a test case up and running tomorrow!
[13:26:54] <ljdevs> why isn't this adding a class? https://gist.github.com/ljdevs/508b2a1d409d76bb93f6
[13:27:49] <robertmaxrees> ljdevs could you set up a fiddle?
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:29:44] <Grundell> So if i want to acces an item with the in the menu by class like this: .navbar-inverse .navbar-nav > li > a how do i reach it?
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:30:10] <Grundell> 	$( '.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav > li > a' ).css( 'color', to );
[13:30:18] <Grundell> That is what i want to achive
[13:30:23] <robertmaxrees> whatever the CSS selector would be.
[13:30:35] <Grundell> but can i write like that as css selector ?
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:30:49] <Grundell> Cool
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your markup it's hard to know exactly what you're working with.
[13:39:10] <ljdevs> it works now but after being clicked, the stars are added to the after elements

[13:45:55] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, so I guess the "e" variable being passed to beforeSend isn't an event, it's some weird ajax object instead. I'm using jasny bootstrap file upload thing, I really need to find out where the damn drop event happens, so I can stopPropagation, because it's uploading duplicate images on one of my pages: https://gist.github.com/robins35/7b64cc6a1af56295c84a
[13:46:33] <Scriptonaut> can anyone look at that, and tell me where I will find the event, before the file upload, but right after it drops?
[13:46:36] <robertmaxrees> don't return false out of that.
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> btw.
[13:46:55] <Scriptonaut> Hmm, why not? I didn't write this code btw
[13:46:59] <Scriptonaut> what does returning false do
[13:47:06] <robertmaxrees> in this case, no clue.
[13:47:17] <robertmaxrees> usually people do it to try to prevent the default action of the event.
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> also: nothing in here has an event in it.
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about how callbacks work.
[13:48:25] <Scriptonaut> this is confusing as hell. I have no idea where the file upload is being triggered
[13:48:35] <Scriptonaut> I know they're not events
[13:48:36] <robertmaxrees> it's hooking that up for you under the hood.
[13:48:46] <Scriptonaut> ah man, so I'm gonna have to hack around
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[13:49:03] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:49:39] <Scriptonaut> basically, we have one of these file uploads on a page. You can also open up another file upload dialog on any page. If you do it on the page that already has the file upload, when you drag an image over the dialog, it /also/ uploads the image to the one behind the dialog
[13:50:09] <Scriptonaut> I think event bubbling occurs or something
[13:50:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like something isn't bound correctly.
[13:50:34] <Scriptonaut> hmm, well what happens
[13:51:02] <Scriptonaut> you mean like in the html? Or the events
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> *the handlers.
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> #listing-image-upload <- is this being used for both file uploads on that particular page?
[13:51:25] <Scriptonaut> ooh, I think it probably is
[13:51:27] <Scriptonaut> let me double check
[13:54:52] <Scriptonaut> hmm, seems like it's not actually
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> you have two file uploaders on one page - how are they getting initialized?
[13:55:29] <robertmaxrees> do they both rely on what you linked?
[13:55:51] <Scriptonaut> we usually only have one. However you can click this thing in the navbar that pops up a dialog that lets you upload an image to it
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> right - how does the one in the dialod get initialized?
[13:56:21] <robertmaxrees> and is it using the same basic HTML as the other?  becuase that means you're duplicating IDs.
[13:56:30] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees, I'm guessing they both rely on what I linked, not positive though, I'll investigate (I didn't write any of this code and the codebase is tens of thousands of lines of code)
[13:56:55] <robertmaxrees> lol my codebase is, too ;)  do they both use the ID "listing-image-upload" ?
[13:57:19] <Scriptonaut> I checked and it doesn't seem like they do
[13:57:36] <robertmaxrees> then that one script doesn't control both forms.
[13:58:01] <Scriptonaut> ya, I'll bug my boss again to see if he remembers
[13:58:19] <ljdevs> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqlHt how to remove elements mousedown after one is selected?
[14:00:13] <Paradisee> is there a way to show an input box where i can type a value and store it?
[14:00:31] <Paradisee> without making <input>
[14:07:40] <Scriptonaut> do you guys know of a good way to find out which element on the page is getting triggered for certain events?
[14:07:55] <Scriptonaut> I think it might be the entire window
[14:08:15] <Scriptonaut> because even though it says, "drag and drop photos here" in this little box, you can drop them anywhere and it will still upload
[14:09:58] <pastry> Scriptonaut: the Chrome Dev tools have a "Event listener" tab when you examine elements, maybe that can help
[14:10:12] <Scriptonaut> I know, it doesn't seem to work for me
[14:10:23] <Scriptonaut> at least I haven't seen a single event in there
[14:11:20] <hlvwrk> is there any way to bring in the jquery mobile flip switch wihtout loading the entire mobile framework?
[14:12:14] <pastry> Scriptonaut: maybe it can be approached from a different side, if you're able to grep the source for a dragstart or mouseenter event and put a breakpoint there
[14:12:59] <pastry> possibly you could add an event listener to the body and see if you're able to catch an event and check its currentTarget
[14:14:05] <pastry> or deeper in the chain
[14:14:20] <pastry> and see if you can capture it before others, and try to work up from there
[14:14:26] <Scriptonaut> I grepped for "draggable" and "droppable", a crapload of bootstrap stuff came up
[14:15:32] <pastry> mmh, if you're dragging files and not other elements I think dragstart is the event they are using
[14:15:42] <pastry> try to see if that gives you fewer results
[14:15:47] <Scriptonaut> oooh thanks
[14:16:08] <pastry> dragstart/dragend etc
[14:16:15] <Scriptonaut> no results
[14:16:27] <pastry> what's the lib?
[14:16:43] <Scriptonaut> My boss said we're using jasny bootstrap jquery file upload
[14:19:15] <Scriptonaut> oh, there's a dragover event
[14:19:29] <daynaskully> {Q} how can i read an arbitary element from a div?  <div myelement="myvalue">
[14:19:46] <pastry> Scriptonaut: this one? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[14:20:59] <tds5016> hi all.
[14:21:11] <tds5016> Can someone tell me how I would find all elements that have a data-event attribute?
[14:21:23] <pastry> Scriptonaut: yeah, looks like all the cool event kids are going here https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js#L55
[14:21:23] <Scriptonaut> not sure honestly, it came with the jasny-bootstrap package
[14:21:37] <Scriptonaut> yep that's it
[14:21:56] <Scriptonaut> thanks
[14:21:57] <pastry> put a breakpoint or some logging there
[14:22:03] <pastry> and see if you can catch something interesting
[14:22:09] <pastry> like where it's been bound to
[14:23:13] <pastry> but I'm guessing it's either having a listener on the body or dynamically attaching and removing events
[14:23:48] <Scriptonaut> ya, somehow the listener is attached to the body
[14:23:49] <pastry> no other way it could detect dragging outside it other than using an overlay
[14:23:51] <Scriptonaut> I can't figure out hwy
[14:24:17] <pastry> well, all events will bubble up to body at the end, so it's cheaper and safer than binding in multiple places
[14:24:31] <pastry> Ã  la jquery.live / jquery.delegate / jquery.on
[14:24:50] <pastry> just one listener on the body, then you see what you caught
[14:25:32] <Scriptonaut> that's what I figured it was, bubbling, so I wanted to find the event so I could stopPropagation()
[14:25:51] <Scriptonaut> but I don't want the drag to be attached to the document like it is
[14:36:27] <fonko> guys im using $( "#dialog" ).dialog(); just like the example from jquery ui
[14:36:34] <fonko> also i have my jquery ui css

[14:36:58] <fonko> no closing button, no nothing

[14:39:13] <elmcrest> hi everybody. I have a select element which I create with ajax. I see on the console f.e. with test[0] the correct element and with it's tags and subtags, but I can't use it that way when I want to append it to somewhere. Sry I have no Idea how to make a fiddle of this :/
[14:39:30] <shoky> `demo @ fonko
[14:39:30] <b-ot> fonko: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:44:50] <elmcrest> I should add maybe that it's a [object HTMLSelectElement] and f.e. I can access .options - but I can't "render" this thing with jquery...
[14:45:39] <shoky> you can append it to the DOM
[14:45:47] <shoky> $('#someelement').append(test)
[14:52:25] <elmcrest> shoky: thx ... but I got it ... damn it this was again a stupid one. test[0].outerHTML did the trick... somehow I always tried to call a method outerHTML()
[14:55:27] <ljdevs_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eqlHt how to remove elements mousedown after one is selected?
[14:55:43] <jwmann> How would I have jQuery wait for a dynamic element to appear in the DOM in order to modify it?
[14:57:22] <Scriptonaut> gah. Ok so there is an overlay for this drag and drop. I'm starting to think the guy who wrote jasny-bootstrap just didn't consider that people might have multiple drag and drop file uploads on the same page (in which case I'm wondering why even have an overlay if it's just going to bubble up)
[14:59:25] <__joshua__> jwmann: is the element inserted with jq?
[14:59:34] <jwmann> __joshua__: Yes! :)
[14:59:46] <__joshua__> http://plugins.jquery.com/livequery/
[15:00:00] <Scriptonaut> wtf you gotta be invited to #twitter-bootstrap
[15:00:31] <__joshua__> and the hack version: http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion
[15:01:05] <shoky> Scriptonaut: it's ##bootstrap
[15:01:52] <Scriptonaut> ah thanks
[15:03:38] <jwmann> Huh, this is pretty intense.
[15:32:35] <nonsolo> hi,
[15:32:48] <jwmann> __joshua__: Wow, this plugin is pretty awesome. Thank you
[15:33:11] <__joshua__> careful with it,  having to use live is generally a bad sign
[15:37:17] <jwmann> __joshua__: I'm using it becuase of a wordpress search plugin inserts the results element appended to the body instead of near the input. Which doesn't give you many options in terms of css styling. (can't have multiple styling for searches in different places on the page, can't use the width from the input element, etc)
[15:37:51] <__joshua__> fair enough
[15:38:44] <nonsolo> i have a mysql table with ~9000 entries and two rows, Zip code and places. I create a dynamic suggested input field. And I follow this "template" http://technotip.com/3541/dynamic-suggested-list-html5-jquery-php-mysql/
[15:40:01] <nonsolo> now only opera 24 can handle it. Firefox 32.0.2 crashes by typing and maxthon too
[15:40:59] <nonsolo> is the db too big? are there better solutions?
[15:41:47] <shodan45> is there a way to easily traverse a table's cols & rows when the table has complex colspans & rowspans? or am I stuck manually calculating things?
[15:46:11] <shodan45> for example, if I had a table with just <td colspan="5"> in it, is there something like uncolspan(3) return that td?
[15:53:00] <hExDJ> is there a way to make an input field not-editable, but also not grayed out?
[15:54:31] <thinkxl> heatxsink: add disabled to the tag and change background-color in the css file
[15:54:33] <thinkxl> ups
[15:54:36] <shoky> hExDJ: <input readonly>
[15:54:50] <thinkxl> disabled doesn't work?
[15:54:54] <thinkxl> on that one?
[15:54:59] <hExDJ> disabled grays out
[15:55:10] <thinkxl> oh, then what shoky said
[15:55:13] <hExDJ> is "readonly" and html5 thing?
[15:55:46] <shoky> it's pre-html5
[15:56:26] <hExDJ> ok, cool, thanks

[19:06:10] <P0rk> does .serializeArray() not include select elements or textarea elements?
[19:06:48] <BillCriswell> P0rk: It does as far as I know.
[19:06:59] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tv2saLab/4/
[19:07:30] <P0rk> What am I doing wrong then. I have a form with two radio buttons, one select button. The radio buttons work, the select is not serialized
[19:07:45] <BillCriswell> P0rk: You don't have a name on the select.
[19:08:31] <P0rk> Wow. I thought it went by id
[19:08:52] <P0rk> so what if you have two fields with the same name (like radio buttons, but say text fields)
[19:09:30] <BillCriswell> I think it would use the input closest to the end of the form
[19:10:02] <BillCriswell> Bed time. Night!
[19:10:09] <P0rk> thanks, gnit
[19:17:27] <P0rk> If you created your own element names could you use jquery to pre-process the page and replace the non-standard elements?

[19:55:14] <Forbidd3n> Is it possible to use jquery to search through a dom element for anything that looks like a phone  number?
[19:55:29] <Forbidd3n> 111.111.1111 or 111-111.1111 or (111) 111-1111
[19:55:31] <Forbidd3n> for example
[19:56:10] <Forbidd3n> maybe a regex that will replace everthing except numbers and spaces
[19:56:26] <Forbidd3n> and then remove duplicate spaces and split on space
[19:57:03] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: there is the :contains selector
[19:57:23] <Forbidd3n> arschmitz: example on your solution?
[19:57:40] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[19:58:06] <Forbidd3n> can I use contains with regex?
[19:58:18] <doug_> Forbidd3n: just brute force $('*').each(function() { /\d{3}[\s-...etc.../.
[19:58:42] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: no i dont think there is a way to use a regex
[19:58:56] <doug_> Forbidd3n: you can't match a selector on content like that but if you brute force the whole page I'm sure it will be almost instant
[19:58:56] <arschmitz> i think your best bet might be to just do what doug_ suggested
[19:58:57] <Forbidd3n> doug_: can you give a full example with the regex, please?
[19:59:03] <Forbidd3n> not really familiar with it all that well
[19:59:10] <doug_> Forbidd3n: yeah
[20:00:53] <Forbidd3n> this is my try at it --    /\d{3}(\.\-\s){1,}\d{3}(\.\-\s){1,}\d{4}/
[20:01:31] <Forbidd3n> I have the entire body text with $(body).html()
[20:01:42] <Forbidd3n> to a variable so do a search with that regex
[20:02:01] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: that will make it hard to figure out what node your dealing with
[20:02:23] <arschmitz> so if you care about what element it is what wont work well
[20:02:27] <Forbidd3n> arschmitz: I just have to find all instance of phone number and replace with another number depending on where they came from
[20:02:55] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: yeah but if you replace and then push that text your will destroy any event bindings
[20:03:20] <arschmitz> because it will be basicly a whole new dom
[20:03:27] <Forbidd3n> gotcha
[20:03:29] <Forbidd3n> hmm
[20:28:06] <Forbidd3n> arschmitz, doug_: this works - http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/
[20:28:09] <Forbidd3n> anything wrong with that?
[20:30:11] <Forbidd3n> and it doesn't mess up dom elements since I am replacing just the text number
[20:31:49] <Forbidd3n> here it is with a click event - http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/2/
[20:31:51] <restius> hello
[20:32:11] <restius> very quick question. if I have a webservice which reads a json request, is there a "name" for that web service?
[20:32:15] <restius> like soap, or restful, etc
[20:32:34] <restius> basically the webservice just waits for the json request, and puts it into a database
[20:32:44] <doug_> Forbidd3n: looks good
[20:34:22] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[20:34:35] <Forbidd3n> that won't affect any dom triggering events would it
[20:35:46] <doug_> restius: soap is an (awful) xml based protocol, it's not that. do you do crud operations on entities using http verbs? then it's restful
[20:37:39] <restius> doug_ no, no get or post data or anything... the PHP script jsut gets the input with file_get_contents('php://input');
[20:38:46] <BigAnt> Hello
[20:39:07] <BigAnt> I have a question about outerHeight method
[20:40:04] <BigAnt> The doc says "$(window).outerHeight() is not allowed"
[20:40:32] <BigAnt> but i can get the correct value by $(window).outerHeight()
[20:40:49] <doug_> BigAnt: on some specific browser yeah
[20:40:58] <doug_> how many browsers have you tried?
[20:41:10] <BigAnt> chrome..
[20:42:16] <doug_> BigAnt: why does your page care though
[20:42:37] <BigAnt> doug_ : Thanks  , I 'll try some other browsers.
[20:43:42] <BigAnt> doug_: I want get the max height of viewport and body
[20:44:38] <doug_> Forbidd3n: I can tweak your script to run much faster
[20:44:47] <Forbidd3n> sure
[20:47:10] <doug_> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/3/
[20:47:25] <doug_> Forbidd3n: always avoid changing the page in a loop when possible
[20:47:54] <doug_> Forbidd3n: note that this test case destroys all the event handlers
[20:48:12] <Forbidd3n> I don't want that though
[20:49:17] <doug_> Forbidd3n: when it sets the html of the page it recreates everything and discards all the old dom elements
[20:49:34] <Forbidd3n> not in my example does it?
[20:49:39] <doug_> it does
[20:49:47] <doug_> when it sets the body html
[20:50:52] <doug_> Forbidd3n: what do you need to really do though?
[20:51:21] <doug_> scraping obviously
[20:51:35] <doug_> why do you change the numbers
[20:52:07] <Forbidd3n> is it possible to check if a referrer to my page came from a google adwords link through?
[20:52:36] <Forbidd3n> doug_: no, they want to display a different phone number to call if coming from google adwords versus other marketing social media sites
[20:53:48] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: this seems like someting that should be done server side
[20:54:05] <Forbidd3n> it can't be - has to use google phone forwarding tool
[20:54:22] <arschmitz> Forbidd3n: but you can set google adwords to what ever link you want so put something in the query string
[20:54:25] <arschmitz> and then look for that
[20:54:53] <Forbidd3n> arschmitz: no, you can grab it from the adwords js embed in site somehow
[20:54:58] <Forbidd3n> I will figure it out
[20:59:25] <doug_> Forbidd3n: I think I have a much better way to iterate the nodes so you can change them without breakage
[21:02:15] <Forbidd3n> I am just changing out the text in the dom that it finds, it should not affect any other triggers/events
[21:02:28] <Forbidd3n> not re-constructing the dom
[21:02:32] <Forbidd3n> just switching out text
[21:19:29] <doug_> Forbidd3n: this one won't destroy all the event handlers http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/7/
[21:20:00] <neredsenvy> Is anyone here familiar with jsPDF ?
[21:20:48] <doug_> Forbidd3n: it precisely modifies just the text nodes
[21:20:57] <Forbidd3n> gotcha
[21:21:14] <Forbidd3n> I thought that is all I was doing is replacing the text phone number
[21:21:29] <doug_> Forbidd3n: by editing the html TEXT of the whole page
[21:21:42] <Forbidd3n> yeah but it is just the textnode
[21:21:49] <Forbidd3n> not any elements wrapped by it
[21:21:55] <doug_> then you throw that wall of html at the browser, it throws away the entire pages nodes and then creates a new everything from your new html
[21:22:31] <doug_> my version just modifies the DOM nodes in-place
[21:23:21] <doug_> Forbidd3n: to be clear: if you set the html of an element, it throws away that node and all of its children, and creates all new nodes from the new html
[21:23:25] <Forbidd3n> doug_: your script won't work with this - <a href="tel:2395552342">2395332323</a>
[21:23:33] <Forbidd3n> mine does though - http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/8/
[21:23:59] <Forbidd3n> yes, but I am only switching out the text, therefore there shouldn't be any children of the text
[21:24:08] <doug_> Forbidd3n: no you arent
[21:24:11] <Forbidd3n> I am matching just the text with .match
[21:24:16] <doug_> you are getting the entire page of html
[21:24:21] <doug_> modifying it
[21:24:25] <doug_> then replacing the whole page html
[21:24:34] <doug_> which destroys all event handlers
[21:24:52] <Forbidd3n> well yes I am searching the entire html of the body
[21:25:03] <Forbidd3n> can you give me a scenario that will break what I am doing?
[21:25:28] <doug_> Forbidd3n: sure, put a click handler on something, run your version of the code, then try the click
[21:25:40] <Forbidd3n> I did already
[21:25:41] <Forbidd3n> one sec
[21:25:44] <doug_> and it will break practically every plugin in existence
[21:25:53] <doug_> because they attach data
[21:26:37] <doug_> Forbidd3n: did you try that anchor?
[21:26:49] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/9/
[21:27:12] <Forbidd3n> it works
[21:29:33] <Forbidd3n> doug_: ?
[21:30:11] <Forbidd3n> I want to see if it breaks which is why I am asking because I have to try to make it somewhat break proof
[21:31:05] <doug_> Forbidd3n: no it doesn't. it attaches the event handler AFTER it destroys all the dom nodes
[21:31:37] <doug_> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/7of1xbm0/11/
[23:30:16] <damiano> hello
[23:31:06] <damiano> i get a json from a php page then i need to save the values in a form
[23:31:08] <damiano> how can i do it?
[23:34:27] <Cork> damiano: depends on how you want to enter them
[23:34:45] <Cork> and how what you want to do maps to the json
[23:34:59] <damiano> Cork, when i do $('#form').serialize();
[23:35:24] <damiano> i get all the fields
[23:35:35] <damiano> i would like to do the same thing via PHP
[23:35:41] <Cork> that is a param string, not json
[23:36:27] <damiano> because jquery ask this data from a POST request...
[23:36:28] <damiano> Cork, yes i bneed to find a way con fill all the form with values
[23:36:28] <damiano> so i thought about JSON
[23:36:28] <Cork> ok, so how does the json map to the form?
[23:36:28] <damiano> but how can i convert my json to let jquery understand how to fill the values?
[23:36:38] <Cork> you can't
[23:36:49] <Cork> you will have to do that yourself
[23:37:27] <damiano> Cork, but if i create something like jquery.serialize() with PHP
[23:37:30] <damiano> I can do it back no?
[23:37:38] <damiano> i mean...if php send data like serialize() format
[23:37:46] <damiano> then jquery can fills the fields right?
[23:37:50] <Cork> ex something like $('form').find(':input').each(function() { $(this).val(json[this.name]); })
[23:38:01] <Cork> damiano: no
[23:38:10] <Cork> jquery doesn't have a way to parse param strings
[23:38:20] <Cork> you would have to do that manually
[23:38:22] <damiano> we can not return back from a serialize()
[23:38:27] <damiano> ok
[23:38:41] <Cork> but simplest is to have the php send the values separate
[23:38:50] <Cork> no need to build a param string
[23:39:01] <Cork> (especially if you send json)
[23:39:38] <damiano> Cork, so i can use JSON then i parse it and loop an the fields it has
[23:39:39] <damiano> right?
[23:39:59] <Cork> no need to parse it
[23:40:10] <Cork> as long as the server doesn't lie about what it sends
[23:41:08] <damiano> Cork, i do not get you pardon...
[23:41:43] <damiano> Cork, i get (from php) something like: {"Ad":{"User":{"Company":{"company":"The name of the company"}}}}
[23:42:04] <damiano> the real input is:
[23:42:08] <damiano> <input name="data[Ad][User][Company][company]" class="form-control" placeholder="Ragione sociale" type="text" id="AdUserCompanyCompany">
[23:42:24] <Cork> damiano: ugg
[23:42:45] <Cork> then ya you would have to find a way to split the input field name to get the keys
[23:43:04] <Cork> and then from there get the value
[23:43:21] <Cork> something like this.name.split('][')
[23:43:28] <Cork> (more is needed)
[23:44:06] <damiano> Cork, i think it is simpler... i mean as you can see we have Ad -- > User --> Company --> company
[23:44:13] <damiano> i can concatenate it to get the ID
[23:44:16] <damiano> no?
[23:44:45] <Cork> then you would have to recursively loop the json objects
[23:44:50] <Cork> instead
[23:44:59] <Cork> looping the form fields is simpler
[23:45:03] <Cork> but sure that is an option
[23:45:53] <damiano> Cork, perfect thank you
