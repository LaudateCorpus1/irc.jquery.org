[18:59:25] <pavonia> Is there something like .closest() but also for siblings of ancestor elements?
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> newp.  you'll have to manually do that yourself.
[19:01:30] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask why.
[19:03:22] <pavonia> I need to find a certain element when some child of the tree was clicked
[19:03:52] <pavonia> .closest(":root").find("#foo") seems to work
[19:05:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same thing fwiw
[19:08:11] <pavonia> Not the same as what?
[19:09:43] <robertmaxrees> your initial question.
[19:10:27] <pavonia> Oh yes, in my case it works too
