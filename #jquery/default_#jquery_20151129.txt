[00:26:13] <Mark___> does anybody know what kind of preloading js plugin this website uses, or is there any js plugin for pre loading that works like this? https://www.behance.net/
[00:54:52] <Mark___> how do i use jquery not selector? am i doing it in a wrong way? jQuery(".list_content_container").not(".list_content").on('click',function(){
[00:56:51] <arc_> it seems like you can probably just use a different initial selector
[00:57:21] <arc_> like 'ul > .list_content_container' or whatever
[00:58:02] <arc_> maybe not though. i don't think you can chain selectors like that in an event binding
[01:00:53] <Mark___> right...
[01:01:28] <Mark___> the .list_content’s inside of the .list_content_container
[01:01:41] <Mark___> and it hides the layer whenever i click on the content
[01:01:47] <Mark___> that’s why i need to use not selector
[01:01:51] <Mark___> but it’s not working so great.
[01:39:54] <arup_r> I am clicking on a link and it is causing double click instead of single click... How can I fix it ?
[02:01:28] <Mark___> i have a loader effect in a div, using css. how can i make this div appear only during the loading progress, and make it fade out after?
[02:15:12] <Mark___> how can i add ‘loading image’ to the jquery or ajax load? https://jsfiddle.net/ock0rg10/
[02:15:34] <Mark___> i want the loader image to appear only while im downloading the data.
[02:15:52] <Mark___> i think there was a simple code that does this if i remember correctly..
[02:19:18] <Pazician> Mark___: I find a lot of posts about your question - I'm sure you'll find it if you Google your question. Here's one I found: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.se/2009/04/display-loading-gif-image-while-loading.html
[02:19:48] <Mark___> if you mean i ask too many questions, sorry.
[02:20:21] <Mark___> and thanks!
[02:31:45] <arup_r> If I share my web page link online, could you help me to say where I am wrong which is causing the double click ?
[02:32:22] <arup_r> I know without seeing it is not easy to solve
[02:33:32] <Pazician> arup_r: Share it and we can try it out :)
[02:33:39] <arup_r> thanks
[02:33:44] <arup_r> give me 2 mins
[02:39:53] <arup_r> url: https://5a0bddfc.ngrok.io username: abc@email.com and password: dsxcaqe3123 .. once loged in to the right top you will see the a menu and click on "distribution list center" .. let me know once you get there..
[02:43:48] <Pazician> arup_r: That's a really slow proxy you're going through
[02:44:09] <arup_r> I don't know any alternative :(
[02:44:24] <Pazician> I'll keep it loading
[02:45:14] <arup_r> let me know once logged in.. I was referecening the issue by taking this guide https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en .. not able to solve it
[02:45:25] <arup_r> help from this**
[02:49:10] <arup_r> Pazician: Are you able to login ? :)
[02:53:35] <Pazician> arup_r: Nope, still loading here
[03:01:35] <arup_r> Pazician: now ? it is loaded for me ,,
[03:05:24] <Pazician> arup_r: I'm now in
[03:05:55] <arup_r> click the distribution list on the menu you will see 2 records
[03:06:03] <arup_r> in a table can you see ?
[03:06:32] <Pazician> arup_r: Right, it was just loading really slow
[03:07:37] <arup_r> now if you click the managelist see one page will show up and again if you click on maange list it will hide
[03:07:40] <Mark___> can someone take a look at this and which part i messed up? sorry, im learning jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/z1cjwry4/
[03:07:56] <arup_r> that click just toggles the page ... is it happening ?
[03:08:15] <arup_r> it before the delete icon
[03:08:50] <Pazician> You mean "Manage records"?
[03:08:56] <Pazician> No
[03:09:21] <Pazician> Manage recipients
[03:09:40] <arup_r> yes just before delete icon
[03:10:03] <Pazician> Yeah, it seems working just fine - it toggles a menu and when I click it again it hides it?
[03:10:09] <arup_r> yes hold on
[03:10:40] <arup_r> now open it and edit the name of any list and save by clicking on the "update list"
[03:11:12] <Pazician> Done, it updated it
[03:11:32] <arup_r> .. now if you click the 'manage recipents' it will not be closed any more.. because one click causing the dobule execution of the JS so it is always open
[03:12:05] <arup_r> you can see the same devtool console.. but no idea why it is happening though
[03:13:13] <Pazician> Where's the .js file, I'll not go through your assets folder lol?
[03:13:44] <Mark___> for some reason, the preloader image that appears when i click on the button, doesn’t disappear even after loading the whole html? what did i do wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/z1cjwry4/1/
[03:14:08] <arup_r> it is under app/assets/distribution_lists
[03:15:58] <arup_r> after updating also ?
[03:16:21] <arup_r> oh sorry,, saw old mssg .. lol thought you asked me
[03:20:16] <Pazician> arup_r: Have you tried moving console.log(id); underneath return to check if it runs all the way?
[03:20:31] <Pazician> On line: 113
[03:21:06] <arup_r> no
[03:21:40] <arup_r> so after update the distlist name if click the manage receipents console.log priting id 2 times
[04:07:33] <arup_r> Pazician: fixed it :)
[04:07:44] <Pazician> arup_r: What was the issue?
[04:10:35] <arup_r> I was calling the a function configureUpdateDistListener() page load and ready, which was attaching the click event on `.manage-list`, now after updating I was calling again configureUpdateDistListener() which is needed.. So ``.manage-list` was getting duplicate `click` handlers.. so Now before calling configureUpdateDistListener() on page change I am unbinding like `    $('.manage-list').unbind('click')` which solved it
[04:11:30] <arup_r> Pazician: Although thanks for showing your interests on my problem
[04:11:36] <arup_r> thanks for your time
[04:12:52] <Pazician> Oh, well done! No worries, I'm glad you solved it and explained how you solved - I do appreciate it, so thank you too!
[04:14:16] <arup_r> JS is so time consuming because lot of things happening underhood
[04:25:38] <Pazician> Agree
[05:25:10] <uskerine> hi, should this work?   alert($(input[id="id"]).length)
[05:25:36] <uskerine> the html has an input with id="id" but the browser stops executing JS code at that point
[05:26:48] <Audlex> why not '#id'?
[05:31:31] <uskerine> Audlex yeah #id makes sense
[05:32:03] <uskerine> but why alert($(#id).length); fails?
[05:32:34] <uskerine> I am executing that alert inside a .click() function for a button
[05:33:08] <uskerine> I am positive that I have a hidden input field id="id"
[06:47:40] <d0de> Hey - this is a little off topic, hope that's OK. Does anyone know if it's possibly to programmatically get the pixels being altered when calling a canvas method like fillText() ?
[06:49:39] <d0de> With other shapes like polygons or circles I have just implemented the drawing function myself. But with text that seems too complicated, so I'm hoping there's some way I can grab the pixels being altered by something like fillText() without actually altering them, so I can then fill those pixels myself
[06:50:00] <robhol> why?
[06:51:08] <d0de> so I have more control over how the text is rendered. So for example at the moment I would like to apply some random jitter to the text, so there's a change each pixel will be shifted on an x/y basis. I can do this with shapes I draw myself, but I don't think I can do this with fillText()
[06:51:16] <d0de> a chance*
[06:52:28] <d0de> but if I could grab the pixels that fillText() decided it needed to fill to render the text, I could then render the text myself with the jitter. (Jitter is an example here, there are quite a few different mutations I am hoping to be able to apply programmatically)
[06:55:22] <d0de> in another channel someone suggested using a secondary canvas that is the same size but not in the DOM. I can call fillText() on that canvas and then extract the shape from the pixel array. I think this approach will work
[07:21:53] <Hellz2K> join #node.js
[07:22:03] <Woet> no
[09:05:27] <jeffreylevesque> from https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html, am I supposed to write `tutorial1.js`, or `tutorial1-raw.js`?
[09:10:24] <derstrom> jeffreylevesque: it's just a comment at the top of the code block
[09:16:11] <jeffreylevesque> derstrom: what's the best way to dynamically / conditionally build forms with react.  trying to replace https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js#L11-L12, with more structured templating
[09:49:24] <jeffreylevesque> should i split https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js into a bunch of classes, in the same file, or multiple files?
[09:53:27] <Mark___> does anyone know why the ajax loaded contents lose a href? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss#
[09:56:52] <derstrom> Mark___: Can you put the specific code into jsfiddle.net please
[09:57:13] <Mark___> im afraid it won’t generate the same exact problem though
[09:57:29] <Mark___> but let me try..
[09:57:48] <derstrom> I don't really know what I need to look at in the URL above.
[09:58:03] <derstrom> There are JS errors in the dev console though.
[09:58:07] <derstrom> You might want to look into that.
[09:59:00] <Mark___> sec.
[09:59:19] <Mark___> okay, i tried to fiddle it, but there’s just no way i can do this as it requires a CMS
[09:59:24] <Mark___> but if you go to the link i provided
[09:59:28] <Mark___> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss#
[09:59:34] <Mark___> you can see there are several posts
[09:59:52] <Mark___> click on the first image that says ‘4’
[09:59:59] <Mark___> you can see that a pop up layer appears.
[10:00:03] <derstrom> I just need to see the code you are using Mark___
[10:00:09] <Mark___> um. sec
[10:00:33] <Mark___> this one is for infinite scroll http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/7/
[10:01:06] <Mark___> and for the actual function of my website : http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/8/
[10:01:20] <derstrom> You are having problems with .load() right?
[10:01:22] <Mark___> basically, if you click on the image, it loads content.
[10:01:27] <Mark___> um i guess so.
[10:01:32] <derstrom> Can you show me that code please?
[10:01:52] <Mark___> which code exactly? apart from the codes i just copied and pasted?
[10:02:32] <Mark___> btw, didn’t yourself help me with the exact coding?
[10:02:39] <Mark___> i think i somehow got thees codes from you
[10:02:53] <Mark___> cause i got helped today or yesterday, idk
[10:03:12] <derstrom> Yes, it was yesterday, or today, depending on timezone.
[10:04:13] <Mark___> if you click on the very first image, it opens a layer, but others none.
[10:04:20] <Mark___> that’s the problem im having.
[10:04:30] <Mark___> cause the rest contents are loaded using ajax
[10:04:44] <derstrom> I see
[10:05:01] <derstrom> OK this must be because those others are dynamically added to the DOM.
[10:05:26] <derstrom> Do you have any click event on the link?
[10:05:37] <derstrom> that executes some JS to open the overlay
[10:05:54] <Mark___> um not sure if im following you
[10:05:59] <Mark___> oh
[10:06:00] <Mark___> sec.
[10:06:25] <Mark___> all the jquery onclick events are ...
[10:06:36] <Mark___> http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/9/
[10:06:47] <derstrom> To bind a click event to dynamically added elements, you need to use .on()
[10:06:49] <Mark___> this is how it opens a layer.
[10:06:54] <Mark___> oh.
[10:06:57] <Mark___> really.
[10:07:52] <jeffreylevesque> should i remove https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/interface/templates/index.html#L38-L50 from html, and use jsx - https://bpaste.net/show/79240ef7315c?
[10:08:05] <Mark___> i thought it was the ajax plugin that i use for infinite scrolling though.
[10:08:11] <Mark___> cause the links are not working properly.
[10:08:33] <derstrom> Mark___ I think the problem here is "jQuery('.list_content_link').on('click'" <-- this won't work for the dynamically added elements because ".list_content_link" is dynamically added to each item when you scroll down
[10:09:01] <Mark___> i dont know about the whole dynamtic thing, but is there anyway i can fix this?
[10:09:06] <derstrom> jeffreylevesque: sorry, I don't know the answer to that. Hopefully someone else can help
[10:09:30] <Mark___> what should i change with what
[10:09:32] <derstrom> Mark___ I see. One sec
[10:09:39] <derstrom> jQuery('.list_content_link').on('click) ... this won't work
[10:09:44] <jeffreylevesque> i mean use reactjs
[10:09:46] <derstrom> close, but it won't work, just a minute
[10:10:40] <derstrom> Mark___ Use jQuery('body').on('click', '.list_content_link', function() { ... });
[10:11:41] <Mark___> what difference is there? im not sure if im following
[10:11:48] <Mark___> it’s the same .on isn’t it?
[10:11:49] <derstrom> Mark___: This is essentially instructing jQuery to bind a click event to all .list_content_link elements that are added to <body>
[10:12:16] <Mark___> oh,so i just use the ‘body’ as it is?
[10:13:05] <derstrom> Mark___ The second parameter in the on() method is what tells jQuery what class we want to bind the click event to
[10:14:06] <Mark___> should it look like this then? http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/10/
[10:14:17] <derstrom> yes, try that
[10:15:21] <Mark___> i did, and it won’t execute the any of the functions.
[10:15:24] <Mark___> sec
[10:15:41] <Mark___> http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/11/
[10:16:31] <derstrom> on('click', 'list_content_container <-- missing .
[10:16:37] <derstrom> in second param
[10:17:40] <derstrom> Mark___ Do you use other libraries that need to use the $ variable?
[10:18:08] <Mark___> well,jQuery is one, but
[10:18:19] <Mark___> this CMS im using also uses $
[10:18:26] <derstrom> I see
[10:18:28] <derstrom> Just asking
[10:18:28] <Mark___> that’s why i need to change every $ into jQuery.
[10:18:57] <Mark___> oh well, i did what you told me to do, and it seems like the results are the same. sorry
[10:19:45] <Mark___> but you are very good teacher. :p
[10:24:25] <derstrom> Mark___ I have noticed you aren't wrapping all of your code in the .ready() function
[10:24:46] <derstrom> https://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/12/ <-- .ready() ends at line 10
[10:24:48] <Mark___> yeah,not all of them need dom ready though do they?
[10:25:07] <derstrom> I would wrap it all in the ready function
[10:27:31] <derstrom> done that?
[10:35:01] <Mark___> $(document).on('mouseover mouseout', '.dosomething', function(){
[10:35:08] <Mark___> this might work.
[10:55:57] <derstrom> Mark___ I would first suggest you wrap all your code in the ready function
[10:56:08] <Mark___> which code are you refering to?
[10:56:17] <derstrom> https://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/12/
[10:56:21] <derstrom> it ends at line 10
[10:56:25] <derstrom> it should end at the very bottom
[10:57:20] <Mark___> yeah.thanks
[10:57:27] <Mark___> i didnt know. but it’s still not fixed.
[10:57:39] <Mark___> i see the infinite scrolling is doing great though
[10:58:59] <derstrom> jQuery('.list_content_link').on('click',function(){ <-- this needs to be jQuery('body').on('click', '.list_content_link' ',function(){ ... })
[10:59:17] <derstrom> slight error:
[10:59:38] <derstrom> jQuery('body').on('click', '.list_content_link ', function() { ... })
[10:59:42] <derstrom> fixed, sorry about that
[11:00:41] <printForever> Simple jQuery question and an even more simpler answer... How do I check IF both ID's exits?
[11:00:55] <derstrom> I have noticed you have a click event on .list_content_link twice. You can move the toggleClass('show') code into the click event underneath the /* Loader */ comment
[11:00:57] <printForever> I'm using $('#id').lenght();
[11:01:08] <printForever> but how do I check if two ID's exits?
[11:01:33] <derstrom> two IDs on the same element?
[11:01:35] <printForever> do I use logical operator?
[11:01:40] <Mark___> thanks for letting me know, though at this point im clueless.
[11:01:46] <printForever> derstrom, two different elements
[11:02:14] <derstrom> Mark___ No worries, I'll provide an example.
[11:02:26] <Mark___> but if that’s not making much difference
[11:02:29] <Mark___> no need for change.
[11:02:36] <printForever> I know how to do it in php, but with jQuery its a mystery...
[11:02:38] <Mark___> im still worried about the functionality.
[11:02:52] <Mark___> why won’t it open?!
[11:03:23] <derstrom> printForever: you can use $('#id1,#id2').length, which would return either 0, 1 or 2 depending on whether they exist in the DOM
[11:03:39] <derstrom> but if you want to check if either exist, use an if statement and check each one
[11:03:53] <derstrom> e.g. if($('#id1').length || $('#id2').length)
[11:03:58] <printForever> that's right!
[11:04:02] <printForever> thank you derstrom!
[11:04:07] <printForever> its the same as in php
[11:04:12] <derstrom> If it doesn't exist, it's 0, which is bool false
[11:04:24] <derstrom> Mark___ I think it will make a difference
[11:04:39] <Mark___> okay then let’s give it a try
[11:07:24] <marrenarre> What's the difference between !!$('#id1, #id2').length and !!($('#id1').length || $('#id2').length)?
[11:08:15] <derstrom> both id1 and id2 must not exist for it to be false
[11:08:19] <robhol> either is horrible
[11:08:31] <derstrom> (in the first one)
[11:10:16] <marrenarre> robhol: Why?
[11:10:42] <marrenarre> derstrom: Same for the second one, isn't it?
[11:11:04] <robhol> because they use syntax as a trick and obfuscate the intention behind the code
[11:11:58] <derstrom> marrenarre: No, the second will be true if either exists
[11:12:33] <derstrom> Mark___: https://jsfiddle.net/rkp9zq93/ something like this
[11:12:49] <derstrom> Mark___ You really need to keep your code formatted for readability
[11:12:52] <Mark___> im wondering if onclick will work.
[11:12:56] <Mark___> k sec.
[11:12:58] <derstrom> Otherwise it'll create confusion.
[11:13:08] <marrenarre> derstrom: (false iff none exists) vs. (true iff at least one exists)?
[11:14:25] <Mark___> how did you come up with this code derstrom ?
[11:14:35] <Mark___> not to be disappointed,but it’s not working either
[11:14:44] <Mark___> i’ll try onclick
[11:14:55] <derstrom> marrenarre: https://jsfiddle.net/xzu3kjr5/
[11:15:32] <marrenarre> derstrom: That's not the same as the code that I wrote.
[11:16:21] <ngharo> thats not true derstrom
[11:16:45] <ngharo> $('#foo, #bar').length is one if only foo exists
[11:17:30] <printForever> derstrom, I'm having problems with AjaxComplete
[11:17:38] <ngharo> !! is used in jquery source iirc, i don't think it's that confusing if you're using it to cast a variable to bool
[11:17:42] <derstrom> ngharo: right... and?
[11:18:13] <printForever> I have 10 elements on the page that are loaded via AjaxComplete, and when I do vwo_$( document ).ajaxComplete(function() { and execute the function/code inside the ajaxComplete, it just works 1 time.
[11:18:22] <printForever> but all 10 elements are loaded at a different moment
[11:18:34] <printForever> with 0.2 sec between them
[11:19:08] <ngharo> derstrom: ah, sorry misread
[11:27:43] <printForever> is there a way to monitor the page until all elements are loaded?
[11:27:51] <printForever> it seems that ajaxComplete is not helping
[11:31:52] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best way to create conditional forms - should i use react / angurlarjs with it's inherent templating mechanism, use react / angularjs with a (json schema) of possible form fields
[11:32:32] <jeffreylevesque> is there a better way to write https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js
[11:32:57] <printForever> derstrom, any idea?
[11:39:47] <marrenarre> jeffreylevesque: switch instead of if/else starting on line 12?
[11:40:27] <marrenarre> Cache selectors?
[11:40:36] <jeffreylevesque> so, don't use some kind of templating framework?
[11:40:49] <derstrom> printForever: Can you provide a full code example on jsfiddle?
[11:41:31] <printForever> derstrom, one moment. but first I had one question
[11:41:55] <printForever> shouldn't && - logical operator - mean that IF both elements are there?
[11:42:15] <printForever> if($('#id1').length && $('#id2').length)
[11:42:25] <derstrom> yes, so if both exist
[11:42:39] <printForever> but... in my case... it works the other way around?!
[11:43:09] <derstrom> you want it to work the other way around?
[11:43:12] <derstrom> or something else?
[11:43:23] <printForever> I wanted to do... If both exist, do nothing, if one or both don't exist do THIS.
[11:43:48] <printForever> maybe I should have used elseif
[11:44:45] <printForever> Here is the scenario. If both exist do nothing. If second one exist do something.
[11:45:39] <derstrom> what if the first exists and the second doesn't? what do you want to happen?
[11:46:40] <printForever> um...
[11:46:48] <printForever> you're right! sorry!
[11:46:50] <printForever> I got confused
[11:47:27] <printForever> If both exist do nothing. If first exist with no second do something. If second exist without the first - that's not possible.
[11:48:39] <derstrom> so really the only thing you want to do is execute some code IF the first exists with the second not existing, right?
[11:48:48] <printForever> yes
[11:48:55] <derstrom> if($('#id1').length && !$('#id2').length)
[11:49:03] <printForever> so simple...
[11:49:05] <derstrom> fairly simple really :)
[11:49:56] <printForever> for some reason it is also executing if SECOND IS THERE
[11:49:58] <printForever> :(
[11:49:59] <derstrom> so if both exist, the if statement is false; if both do not exist, the if statement is also false
[11:50:15] <derstrom> You need to show the actual code you're using.
[11:50:26] <derstrom> as the code example I have provided should work just fine
[11:50:39] <printForever> I know...
[11:50:46] <printForever> Making the fiddle takes too damn long :)
[11:50:53] <derstrom> has to be done :)
[11:51:09] <printForever> but I can't simulate ajax load in fiddle
[11:51:09] <printForever> so...
[11:51:19] <printForever> GOT IT!
[11:51:20] <derstrom> you don't need to in this case
[11:51:21] <printForever> I've got it!
[11:51:24] <derstrom> OK good.
[11:51:32] <printForever> I found how to do it for each
[11:51:34] <printForever> do a correct check
[11:51:38] <printForever> and execute the code
[11:51:44] <printForever> now I just have to figure out
[11:51:49] <derstrom> What's that?
[11:51:50] <printForever> how to execute after ajaxComplete
[11:51:58] <printForever> because it does not work...
[11:52:16] <derstrom> Again if you paste your JS code on jsfiddle.net, we can see if there is any obvious problem with the code.
[11:52:31] <printForever> ok
[11:53:04] <Uhkis> [18:51] < printForever> but I can't simulate ajax load in fiddle
[11:53:08] <Uhkis> yes you can
[11:53:24] <derstrom> e.g. a syntax problem
[11:54:01] <printForever> hm...
[11:54:26] <printForever> I'm going to try for another 15-30 minutes on my own
[11:54:48] <Uhkis> printForever: here's an example how http://jsfiddle.net/L8su2/
[11:54:59] <printForever> thank you Uhkis
[11:55:54] <printForever> is this how I check if the DIV has any text? if(vwo_$("div.sigma").text().length) {
[11:56:06] <printForever> is this how I check if the DIV has any text? if($("div.sigma").text().length) {
[11:56:38] <Uhkis> seems right to me
[11:57:04] <derstrom> yes
[11:57:06] <printForever> and I should just put ! in front of it
[11:57:18] <printForever> if I want to see if it's empty
[11:57:18] <derstrom> if you put ! in front of it, the if statement would match if it's 0
[11:57:21] <derstrom> yes
[11:57:42] <derstrom> best way to find these kinds of things out is trying them yourself and seeing the result
[11:57:48] <derstrom> you can use jsfiddle to Run code and test
[11:57:57] <printForever> nope... no results :/
[11:58:24] <derstrom> https://jsfiddle.net/9hg19c8j/ <-- like this
[11:58:36] <derstrom> remove the text from the element and run it again
[11:59:14] <printForever> derstrom, thank you
[11:59:28] <printForever> how can I see... actually see when ajaxComplete is done?
[11:59:37] <printForever> can I write that into console every time its done?
[12:00:40] <derstrom> sure, console.log( ... )
[12:01:09] <printForever> vwo_$( document ).ajaxComplete(function() {
[12:01:09] <printForever>     console.log ('Ajax has fired!');
[12:02:54] <derstrom> Again if you posted your ajaxComplete code on jsfiddle, we might be able to help you ;-)
[12:03:01] <printForever> I caaaaant :(
[12:03:06] <derstrom> Then we can't help much
[12:03:21] <printForever> you've been a BIG HELP
[12:03:36] <printForever> i get fractions here and there and piece it in my mind
[12:03:49] <printForever> sometimes I over complicate things
[12:03:58] <printForever> like the !$('') :D
[12:04:14] <derstrom> takes time to master anything
[12:05:03] <printForever> I got Ajax has fired 15 times! :)
[12:16:57] <printForever> when selecting sibiling of a parent
[12:17:37] <printForever> and checking with if
[12:17:38] <printForever> if (!$(this).parent().sibilings("#idOfSibiling").text().lenght) {}
[12:18:25] <derstrom> lenght - length
[12:18:35] <derstrom> did you write out that code or paste it from where you're using it?
[12:18:37] <printForever> right, sorry :)
[12:18:43] <printForever> I write it on my own
[12:18:49] <printForever> that's why it sucks :)
[12:19:01] <derstrom> if you're using that code then obviously you need to replace lenght with length
[12:19:19] <printForever> my IDE fixes it :)
[12:19:40] <printForever> Method expression is not of Function type
[12:19:43] <printForever> on .parent()
[12:20:21] <derstrom> the code looks fine to me then
[12:20:36] <derstrom> don't know why your IDE is saying that, but the code *should* work
[12:20:36] <Mark___> um.
[12:20:59] <Mark___> i toally lost sense of reality and the programming.
[12:21:13] <Mark___> my head spinning with the bunch codes that i donot understand
[12:21:14] <Mark___> :0
[12:21:15] <Mark___> :p
[12:21:19] <Mark___> but.
[12:21:27] <derstrom> Tough spot you're in :-(
[12:21:35] <derstrom> Take a break and come back to it another time.
[12:21:41] <Mark___> since you are here, and i dont know how else we can meet in another time,
[12:21:43] <derstrom> If necessary, force yourself ;-)
[12:21:55] <Mark___> letme throw somemore questions
[12:22:02] <derstrom> There are plenty of other folks here that can help too.
[12:22:19] <Mark___> right.
[12:22:35] <Mark___> it’s not the same compelx question though
[12:22:37] <Mark___> so no worries.
[12:22:38] <Mark___> :p
[12:22:55] <Mark___> i edited the codes you gave me, by combining with the original codes.
[12:23:00] <Mark___> and it seems like it’s working okay
[12:23:10] <Mark___> excpet that it doens’t ‘load’ actual contents.
[12:23:17] <Mark___> but myquestion is rather simple this time
[12:23:26] <Mark___> how do i make that preloader disappear
[12:23:33] <Mark___> after it loads the whole html?
[12:23:34] <Mark___> https://jsfiddle.net/rkp9zq93/5/
[12:23:40] <Mark___> right now, it’s just staying.
[12:24:13] <derstrom> Could you tell me what you mean by pre-loader?
[12:24:27] <Mark___> sec.
[12:24:38] <Mark___> the .loader_container
[12:24:43] <Mark___> has the preloader img
[12:24:53] <Mark___> that appears before loading the html page
[12:25:04] <Mark___> i simply want to make it disappear
[12:25:10] <Mark___> after the document is fully loaded.
[12:25:57] <derstrom> OK well I am not quite sure what you are referring to but answering blind, if it's an element that is in the .loader_container, you can hide it after the .load() has been fired perhaps?
[12:26:15] <Mark___> right..
[12:26:18] <printForever> derstrom, a .sibilings() question. Ii I put .sibilings("#first #second"), I am actually making a selector in that sibilings element, going down its DOM?
[12:26:19] <derstrom> if the pre-loader image is indeed a separate HTML element, then you can simply use $( ... ).hide()
[12:26:44] <Mark___> right. i see what you are saying,
[12:26:52] <Mark___> but i can’t grasp a sense of how i can start writing.
[12:27:10] <derstrom> printForever: I actually think that means match the siblings that have both first and second id
[12:27:17] <printForever> ah...
[12:27:34] <derstrom> if you want to match elements that have either, use #first, #second
[12:27:48] <printForever> so I need to go (this) + 1 level up + sibiling + that sibiling's child
[12:29:16] <printForever> I'm grabbing a "select > option" text, and then moving it to another SPAN that is located in a child that is... over <select> as I described the path in the previous sentance
[12:30:32] <marrenarre> printForever: $(this).parent().sibling('span').text($(this).text())
[12:31:15] <marrenarre> Or was the <span> the child of a sibling?
[12:31:25] <derstrom> Mark___: You really need more experience I am afraid, or you're going to come across problems like this dealing with a project that is outside of your current experience level.
[12:31:48] <Mark___> that is right, but i usually avoid programming,
[12:31:54] <marrenarre> (If the <span> is the parent then .sibling('span').children().)
[12:31:54] <Mark___> there are people for that.
[12:32:20] <Mark___> but yeah, i need to be acquainted with
[12:32:28] <printForever> marrenarre it was a child of a sibiling
[12:32:28] <Mark___> jquery and some basic stuffs
[12:32:32] <printForever> ok
[12:32:55] <marrenarre> Okay.
[12:35:01] <printForever> marrenarre, how to get $(this).option:selected?
[12:35:32] <marrenarre> printForever: Are you trying to get the value of it?
[12:35:35] <derstrom> Mark___: Everyone was once new to jQuery. But if you don't have much experience with JavaScript then you really need to get familiar with JavaScript first, or you won't really understand what jQuery code is doing. And it's important to know that.
[12:35:46] <printForever> marrenarre, text, not value
[12:35:47] <printForever> $("option:selected", this)
[12:36:04] <Mark___> thanks for your kind advice.
[12:36:12] <Mark___> right now, i need to devleop my design skills first i think.
[12:36:23] <Mark___> as well as getting to know some programming langugages.
[12:36:26] <marrenarre> printForever: Is "this" the <select>?
[12:36:31] <printForever> yes!
[12:36:54] <derstrom> Mark___ Best of luck
[12:37:15] <printForever> Mark___, friendly advice, if you're starting now, you need to learn fast and work harder because you have sooo much ground to cover. design, front-end, back-end... It's not a one man job anymore.
[12:37:59] <Mark___> right.
[12:37:59] <marrenarre> printForever: $(':selected', this).text()
[12:38:07] <marrenarre> So yes yours would work.
[12:38:16] <printForever> ok
[12:38:38] <printForever> marrenarre, it works but then it just breaks
[12:38:49] <printForever> like, for 15 elements I have, it process the 3rd and 10th element
[12:38:54] <printForever> and all others are left empty
[12:38:56] <printForever> wtf
[12:39:22] <marrenarre> printForever: Link?
[12:40:35] <printForever> marrenarre, that's the problem... no lin
[12:40:37] <printForever> *k
[12:40:39] <derstrom> Mark___ To be clear you don't need to be an expert at everything. E.g. a designer might have limited programming experience, so they may work with a team of developers that collectively make up the experience you need to create a company website, for example.
[12:40:57] <derstrom> Often this is the case in a workplace environment.
[12:41:17] <Mark___> yes.you seem to be very experienced.
[12:41:25] <Mark___> I’d take that into my brain.
[12:41:29] <derstrom> People are experienced in a particular field that compliments the lack of experience of another person in a team.
[12:41:34] <derstrom> etc
[12:41:38] <Mark___> right.
[12:42:03] <printForever> I'VE MADE IT!!!
[12:42:07] <Mark___> for now, as my envrionmental situation isn’t all that fascinating, i prefer to work aone
[12:42:10] <Mark___> *alone
[12:42:23] <Mark___> but im willing to make up a team for a new design company sure
[12:42:30] <Mark___> thanks for the advice.
[12:44:21] <printForever> derstrom, marrenarre, I have just one more question...
[12:44:43] <printForever> I've done everything I needed, but there is a minor bug.
[12:44:44] <derstrom> Mark___: I find it is often the case in a workplace environment where a team may consist of designers and developers, and each one is not experience at the other. It's actually good in this way because you have a team of people that have a lot of a lot of experience in specific areas they are interested in.
[12:45:02] <derstrom> But you can get folks that are good at both too.
[12:45:22] <printForever> I'm using .text().substring(9,14); to get the certain part of the text from the :selected
[12:45:36] <printForever> however on one select field, there is an extra character
[12:45:43] <Mark___> speaking of which, let me ask another question for you
[12:45:46] <printForever> offseting my substring and making it look weird
[12:45:47] <derstrom> Mark___: For me, I am a developer, not a designer. I can't do design.
[12:45:54] <Mark___> i see.
[12:45:56] <derstrom> I can get by, but it's not my area of expertise.
[12:46:06] <derstrom> And I don't want it to be.
[12:46:09] <Mark___> yeah, i dont considermyself as a programmer either.
[12:46:15] <Mark___> i just like designing part.
[12:46:15] <derstrom> Well, I would, but I'm not the artistic type.
[12:46:18] <Mark___> and some planings.
[12:46:25] <Mark___> is this wrong?   jQuery('body').on('click', '.list_content_container', function() {
[12:46:51] <Mark___> oops
[12:46:52] <Mark___> sorry
[12:46:53] <Mark___> wrong one
[12:47:09] <Mark___> jQuery(".list_content_container").not(".list_content").on('click',function(){
[12:47:23] <Mark___> for some reason if i click on the .list_content, the layer coses.
[12:47:25] <Mark___> *closes
[12:47:29] <Mark___> is there anyway i can fix this?
[12:47:43] <printForever> is .list_content inside .list_content_container?
[12:47:48] <Mark___> yes.
[12:47:51] <printForever> there you go
[12:47:53] <Mark___> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss
[12:48:37] <printForever> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss just a bunch of text, some chat box and no CSS
[12:48:53] <Mark___> it’s your expansion.
[12:48:58] <Mark___> that blocks css.
[12:49:07] <printForever> it blocks whatever it needs to block :)
[12:49:09] <derstrom> printForever: re. substr, not sure what we can do to help with that
[12:49:10] <Mark___> adblock andublock
[12:49:12] <printForever> its your problem, not mine
[12:49:18] <Mark___> yeah, but this one’s not the case.
[12:49:22] <derstrom> substring*
[12:49:36] <printForever> derstrom, can I check the "text lenght" before I substring it?
[12:50:01] <marrenarre> printForever: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length
[12:50:48] <printForever> Mark___, you need to build your website having in mind that people use AdBlock and they are using it for a reason. Your CSS must always load
[12:50:58] <printForever> tnx marrenarre, I will check it out
[12:51:04] <Mark___> i already contactedmy web hosting company for this
[12:51:14] <Mark___> but all they say is that they cannot do anything about it,
[12:51:24] <Mark___> hopefully, once i get a new domain or something
[12:51:29] <Mark___> it will fix the problem itself.
[12:51:44] <Mark___> does it block this one too? http://xestudio.xco.kr/
[12:51:55] <marrenarre> Mark___: Yes.
[12:51:58] <printForever> Mark___, what is xco.kr?
[12:52:00] <Mark___> oh well.
[12:52:03] <printForever> free domain?
[12:52:03] <Mark___> free domain.
[12:52:07] <printForever> oh boy...
[12:52:22] <derstrom> Invest in a domain, they are fairly cheap ;)
[12:52:26] <Mark___> then i’d have to change my webhosting company or something...
[12:52:35] <derstrom> Web hosting is fairly cheap too
[12:52:39] <Mark___> but i dont plan on doing business internationally
[12:52:45] <Mark___> so…
[12:52:45] <printForever> Mark___ you can get a domain name for 1.99 USD!!!
[12:52:56] <Mark___> thanks for the advertisement.
[12:52:59] <Mark___> but seriosly,
[12:53:04] <Mark___> how do i fix the click problem?
[12:53:12] <printForever> .99 on GoDaddy
[12:53:12] <derstrom> I doubt you can renew domains at $2, there will be a catch to that
[12:53:17] <derstrom> usually just for the first year
[12:53:22] <printForever> lol, advertisment
[12:53:43] <printForever> derstrom, of course not, he will pay a 9.99 like everyone after 1 year
[12:53:56] <printForever> hopefully he will earn those 10 bucks in 12 months
[12:54:06] <Mark___> okay, im going to bed
[12:54:09] <Mark___> and get some red
[12:54:11] <Mark___> rest
[12:54:12] <Mark___> :p
[12:54:16] <Mark___> see you guys all.
[12:54:16] <printForever> I still can't believe he said I was advertising something...
[12:54:22] <printForever> dude...
[12:54:25] <Mark___> lol
[12:54:28] <printForever> *facepalm*
[12:54:29] <Mark___> you were advertising
[12:54:43] <printForever> get a domain name Mark... get it anywhere...
[12:54:55] <Mark___> i need to do something about my webhosting
[12:55:03] <Mark___> hopefully 1 year later though
[12:55:07] <printForever> lol, again with the webhost
[12:55:23] <derstrom> jquery code won't start magically working any different simply by changing hosts or getting your own domain
[12:55:28] <derstrom> just in case this is what you are implying!
[12:55:35] <Mark___> nope.
[12:55:39] <Mark___> not in the slightest way
[12:55:49] <Mark___> but in only 25
[12:55:53] <Mark___> give me a break
[12:55:53] <printForever> and the domain name and hosting are both free, so he is expecting something from them :D its not a problem that its free and it sucks, but he wants to find out whats wrong with the host, nothing is wrong with his code or knowledge
[12:55:58] <printForever> lol 25, you're old
[12:55:59] <Mark___> 24 *
[12:56:12] <printForever> I know people who are doctors with 24
[12:56:16] <printForever> you are old enough
[12:56:18] <Mark___> right..
[12:56:22] <printForever> and almost late to the party
[12:56:31] <Mark___> thanks for the reminder
[12:56:37] <Mark___> you are always so charming
[12:56:42] <printForever> better break that piggy bank and get those 10 bucks
[12:56:59] <Mark___> what’s the secret of your charm that drives people into nuts?
[12:57:05] <derstrom> lol
[12:57:16] <printForever> for the price of pizza you can get a domain name and proper hosting
[12:57:23] <derstrom> printForever: he got it
[12:57:25] <Mark___> ah.advertisement it is
[12:57:28] <printForever> but no... code will fix itself once he changes the host
[12:57:41] <printForever> derstrom, I don't think he did :D
[12:57:48] <derstrom> he did, you can stop now
[12:57:54] <derstrom> please
[12:58:02] <Mark___> or i will start speakingin Japanese.
[12:58:25] <derstrom> I wish I knew a second language ;)
[12:58:27] <Mark___> im hungry, and it’s 3 in the morning.
[12:58:50] <Mark___> im going to get McDonald’s crispy burger early in the morning.
[12:58:52] <Mark___> yes.
[12:58:54] <Mark___> i will.
[12:59:02] <Mark___> so
[12:59:02] <derstrom> Mark___: An amazing idea
[12:59:06] <Mark___> good bye all
[12:59:09] <derstrom> bye
[12:59:25] <printForever> There is always that one "smart guy" who thinks "Yeah, I can brek the system. Paid domains and hosting companies are a rippoff. I will get myself a free hosting and domain, yes that will work!".
[12:59:37] <derstrom> but that's assuming he is thinking that
[12:59:51] <printForever> derstrom, come on, he said it himself
[12:59:55] <derstrom> I doubt he thinks paid hosting is a rip off
[13:00:37] <printForever> derstrom, the guy thinks he's hosting is just fine, he talked to the web host support people, there is nothing they can do, so the problem must be in the code...
[13:01:45] <printForever> and offering an idea where he could buy a domain name, the most popular domain service in the world first comes to mind, and I don't even use them... and calling that an ad... oh boy
[13:01:59] <derstrom> you became offended from him saying that, that's the real problem
[13:02:29] <printForever> no, it's not
[13:02:41] <printForever> I became offended because of his stupidity and arrogance
[13:03:06] <derstrom> He wasn't being arrogant and stupid in my view, but it's all good.
[13:03:18] <printForever> well... its all by gones
[14:00:47] <printForever> derstrom, is it possible to "click" an element on a page with jQuery? All research I've done says no.
[14:31:19] <arc_> printForever http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:31:32] <printForever> tnx arc_
[14:32:26] <printForever> how do I trigger that here https://www.veebimajutus.ee/domeeni-registreerimine/?domain=jqueryirc&tld=ee
[14:32:54] <printForever> do you see the "Jah" button on the top right
[14:32:59] <printForever> green with white dot
[14:33:22] <arc_> i mean .. you just select it and trigger the event you want to trigger
[14:33:35] <printForever> I don't get it:/
[14:33:50] <printForever> I don't know what is the event trigger
[14:34:16] <arc_> if you're trying to write a userscript for a website you have no control over, it's more complicated
[14:34:32] <printForever> :)))) no kidding
[14:34:53] <printForever> how can I find the trigger?
[14:35:34] <arc_> there probably isn't one
[14:35:46] <printForever> whaaa?
[14:36:00] <printForever> have you opened the url?
[14:36:20] <arc_> yes
[14:36:43] <printForever> where can I see the event that is being fired once a button is clicked?
[14:37:01] <arc_> you have to use plain javascript for this, not jquery https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click
[14:37:43] <arc_> so something like $('selector')[0].click(); would work
[14:37:57] <printForever> question, why is [0] there?
[14:38:00] <printForever> 0 index?
[14:38:29] <arc_> because click() expects that data type to be passed, not a jquery object
[14:39:35] <printForever> IT WORKED!
[14:43:10] <Magik6k> How can I make post ajax request sending binary data from byta array? (no, JSON won't work)

[15:06:45] <ashgotti> Afternoon all. I need a bit of help with jQuery datepicker. I've set 'noWeekends' and don't have any errors, but I can still select weekends. I'm not sure what I'm missing
[15:07:40] <Uhkis> ashgotti: make a fiddle
[15:08:31] <ashgotti> Uhkis: I'll try. It's using Drupal so it won't be pretty
[15:11:28] <ashgotti> Hmm I think it may be the version of jQuery I'm running. Thanks for jsfiddle tip. Just setting it up there helped
[15:12:02] <Uhkis> ashgotti: ah, so your nick was familiar from #drupal :)
[15:12:27] <ashgotti> Ukhis: :) I'm typically in both channels
[15:28:41] <ashgotti> Ok, figured out my datepicker issue is related to jQuery 1.7+ and Drupal. If I set jQuery to 1.4 or 1.5 it works but my other code, like '$(document).on('change', '.field-name-field-subject-property input', function () {});' gives me 'is not a function'.
[15:30:28] <derstrom> ashgotti: Do you know if Drupal uses alternative jQuery variable instead of $?
[15:30:48] <Uhkis> ashgotti: use live() for older jquery
[15:31:29] <ashgotti> derstrom: I have to use (function ($) { // $.code here }(jQuery)); and it's fine
[15:31:42] <ashgotti> Uhkis: I don't want to have to update my JS files :/
[15:32:55] <derstrom> I see.
[15:33:26] <Uhkis> ashgotti: well then youre stuck with the other problem
[15:34:09] <Uhkis> on was added on 1.7
[15:34:13] <ashgotti> Ukhis: Maybe this is a better question for #drupal but it seems that jQuery Datepicker does not work propelry with jQuery >+ 1.7
[15:34:21] <ashgotti> *>=
[15:34:44] <Uhkis> hmm, can you use newer jquery ui?
[15:36:10] <ashgotti> Looking into that now. The iste uses jquery 1.7.1, jqueryui 1.10.2
[15:36:43] <derstrom> More than anything it sounds like a conflict, since the $ variable I assume is being used by another library.
[15:36:48] <derstrom> But it's a wild guess.
[15:38:01] <ashgotti> Thanks for the help. It seems that this an issue caused by the jquery and jqueryui combination I have. Going to investigate this
[15:40:18] <derstrom> Best of luck.

[15:43:12] <phobz> Hello. Ive got this code http://jsfiddle.net/7ea0Lm1z/2/ which calculates inputs from 2 fields, however, when i apply the code to my page, it doesnt work as all field names dynamically change when they are loaded in Fill-in mode.
[15:43:17] <phobz> The form allows me to click Add more and it will copy all the fields in another section of the same page so essentially I need something to work with scalability. I contacted their support and they gave me this code but im not sure how to implement it: $(this).closest('.repeat').find['name$="FieldName"']
[16:06:50] <phobz> anybody around? :)
[16:19:54] <Renari> I'm trying to use a metacritic api found here: https://market.mashape.com/byroredux/metacritic-v2 to grab game information there are multiple examples on that site however none are using jquery. I've setup my ajax call like so: http://jsfiddle.net/vo87rprt/1/ however this is returning a 401 unauthorized exception. Does anyone maybe know what the problem is, from what I researched that is how you would pass the auth headers.
[16:26:12] <Renari> Ah the ajax call now supports setting headers via a header option and that seems to work.
[16:28:43] <shoky> Renari:  berforeSend ;)
[16:30:00] <Renari> shoky: that's what I was doing with xhr.setRequestHeader but that wasn't working
[16:30:14] <shoky> Renari: notice the spelling of berforeSend
[16:30:15] <Renari> using the header ajax option however did work
[16:30:40] <Renari> Oh wow, LOL
[16:30:47] <shoky> ;p
[16:30:50] <Renari> oh well I got it working thanks
[18:33:53] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here use browserify?
[18:36:20] <jeffreylevesque> if i define a `.babelrc` for browserify (I'm using reactjs), does it have to be placed in the cwd of where the `browserify` command is run?
[18:47:28] <Mark__> does anyone have an idea how i can create this kind of ‘preloader’? http://chemi.kr/heavy
[19:03:23] <madprops> is there an event when resizing of a textarea stops?
[19:26:07] <jeffreylevesque> what does `import path from "path";` mean, specifically the "path"
[19:30:18] <arc_> jeffreylevesque path is an environment variable which allows you to define what directories your operating system will search in when you try to run something by name from any directory without typing out the full path
[19:30:49] <jeffreylevesque> is this env variable defined from js, or the os?
[19:31:11] <arc_> the os
[19:31:27] <arc_> it's basically asking if you want to copy the definition from the os to your install
[19:32:18] <jeffreylevesque> so, babel will always look for babelrc at a specific directory - https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/9110cbfbc86e5e3452d1f90b8f91b9ad6678596c/packages/babel-cli/src/babel-doctor/rules/has-config.js#L1?
[19:32:46] <jeffreylevesque> well, cwd?
[19:33:32] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/9110cbfbc86e5e3452d1f90b8f91b9ad6678596c/packages/babel-cli/src/babel-doctor/rules/has-config.js#L1-L12 will calculate the current working directory relative to the system path
[23:05:30] <MarGul> I have a hidden input field(<input type="hidden" name="tags[]" id="tags">) and I want to be able to push elements into this post array. Am I still just using the value and then having to serilize it or can I actually treat this input field as an array in jQuery to add/remove elements?
