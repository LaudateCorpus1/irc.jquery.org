[00:03:14] <elyort> Trying to have a clickable element that populates HTML in a div, then clicking it again clears the div. How do I get it to work? This is my latest effort. https://jsfiddle.net/tLxsbc2q/10/
[00:03:48] <elyort> Any help appreciated
[00:18:27] <Guest69582> if i have a collection as z, like this ==>>    z = $("[data-index='" +v+ "']")    how can i add n pixels to each member of the collection?
[00:31:51] <mrush> what am i doing wrong with width here, i'm trying to increase the current width of every member of a collection. termbin.com/mvzq
[00:33:15] <mrush> im unclear on how .width(function(){}) wants me to address the existing width of each member
[00:34:46] <Woet> mrush: see http://api.jquery.com/css/
[00:36:10] <mrush> Woet thank you, reading now
[01:06:19] <newbie666> ok.. so what's wrong with this picture: https://kopy.io/y4Inn#line-68
[01:06:48] <newbie666> line 68 gets triggered twice, while line 20 doesn't get triggered at all
[01:08:00] <newbie666> so the add-user-modal doesn't work... and the add-supplier-modal gets triggered twice ... wtf ?
[01:08:26] <newbie666> i mean the buttons that are binded there
[02:03:56] <Cork> newbie666: check the compiled (real) javascript
[02:04:15] <Cork> it will be obvious why it works weirdly
[03:45:47] <haroldjfks> hello, on a html page after the <body... > I have the string "1". Now, not important what's the issue and the cause...but how you would remove that "1" by jQuery ? thanks
[03:46:29] <Cork> you mean just the character 1?
[03:47:17] <haroldjfks> Cork: yes, exactly... i have this "1" after the body and I need to remove it from front view
[03:47:25] <Cork> after the body?
[03:47:31] <Cork> or first in the body?
[03:47:45] <haroldjfks> Cork: that is, exactly... the first in the body
[03:48:15] <Cork> you can't really do that with jquery as jquery works with elements not nodes
[03:50:29] <Cork> haroldjfks: https://jsfiddle.net/aggeqge1/1/
[03:51:00] <Cork> though be careful to not run that more then once cause then it will remove things you want to keep in the page
[03:52:58] <Cork> but ya, it is better to fix what ever create the broken page to start with
[03:53:18] <Cork> depending on javascript to fix server errors is a bad idea
[03:55:19] <haroldjfks> Cork: ok, thank you ;-)
[05:02:41] <mrush> im only going to say this once
[05:17:12] <Robdgreat> fair enough
[05:17:53] <mrush> Robdgreat: thx for going there w me
[05:18:21] <Robdgreat> I got there eventually
[05:18:34] <Robdgreat> timestamps help
[05:18:43] <Robdgreat> "er... ohhhh..."
[05:23:13] <mrush> lol
[05:54:54] <scetian> Hi, I want to call a function after 1s but dont want to use setTimeout function. Is there any other way to do this?
[06:25:50] <daN-R-G> scetian, and the reason for not using the function that exactly does what you want is...?
[07:01:53] <AdamPDotty> ask and be asked
[07:04:17] <Cork> scetian: no, there isn't
[07:04:25] <Cork> for timing you need to use timers
[07:04:53] <Cork> though, except for animation you normally don't need 1s timing
[07:05:17] <Cork> (cause use use callbacks or things like that instead)
[07:09:19] <AdamPDotty> Well, on SO you find a function that basically implements sleep. Probably uses up some resources.
[07:09:51] <Cork> you can't do that, cause it will lock the js process that runs on the browsers main thread
[07:09:58] <Cork> so the browser won't render anything
[07:10:11] <Cork> in a webworker or something like node.js you can
[07:10:26] <Cork> but not in places you would normally use jquery
[07:11:21] <Cork> you could start a webworker and have it postMessage to the site to trigger when 1s has passed, but... really? :D
[07:37:13] <TiffanyAmber> Hello, not really a jquery question, but couldn't find a css channel :(    Can someone tell me a good css channel on freenode?
[07:37:52] <Cork> #css ?
[07:38:04] <Cork> it is the css channel on freenode
[07:39:54] <TiffanyAmber> seems like it?
[07:39:56] <TiffanyAmber> but no one's here
[07:39:59] <TiffanyAmber> might I help?
[07:40:11] <Cork> uhh 448 ppl is noone?
[07:42:23] <TiffanyAmber> no one's active I mean ;-(
[07:43:17] <Cork> then you're not checking the channel enough
[07:46:03] <newbie666> https://kopy.io/fRyiz#line-66
[07:46:18] <newbie666> any ideas what's wrong with line 66 & 18 ?
[07:47:12] <newbie666> line 18 isn't triggered at all, and 66 twice
[07:47:21] <newbie666> it's like it's ignoring the whole first part
[07:48:16] <Cork> newbie666: check the response i gave you the last time you asked
[07:48:30] <newbie666> Cork: actually i was asleep when you replied
[07:48:44] <newbie666> checked it when i came online now, but that's the actual js code compiled
[07:48:55] <Cork> no
[07:49:01] <Cork> that is coffiescript
[07:49:07] <newbie666> nope
[07:49:10] <newbie666> js
[07:49:22] <Cork> ah, right fatt arrows
[07:49:27] <newbie666> yep
[07:49:29] <Cork> well in that case
[07:49:30] <newbie666> lazy me :D
[07:49:51] <Cork> well in that case line 65 binds a function to the variable cb
[07:50:03] <Cork> and console is on the next line and runs without any relation to that
[07:50:17] <Cork> cb is then bound as event handler on line 79
[07:50:47] <Cork> or sent as callback or something
[07:50:51] <Cork> depends on FormHandler
[07:51:18] <newbie666> sent as b
[07:51:20] <newbie666> cb
[07:52:13] <newbie666> https://kopy.io/t6nbC
[07:52:20] <newbie666> this is from FormHandler
[07:52:33] <newbie666> i just made a function that will handle the $.post part
[07:52:50] <newbie666> and then on line 34 i call the cb
[07:56:56] <newbie666> so... any ideas ?
[07:58:01] <newbie666> though i think i gotta refactor what i'm doing there to get the modal ids into an array and then just call ModalHandler on each, right ?
[07:59:53] <newbie666> aaaand everyone died
[08:01:23] <AdamPDotty> lost me @ asleep
[08:02:09] <newbie666> well let me know when you get found
[08:20:10] <Cork> newbie666: could you make a jsfiddle showing the problem you're trying to solve?
[08:21:03] <newbie666> jesus no.. i wouldn't know where to start lol
[08:21:06] <newbie666> but i'm refactoring it
[08:21:11] <andri_> Hi all… is there an expert in here who could answer a few “can this be done at all” questions? Much appreciated
[08:21:15] <newbie666> coz it was stupid to have such duplicate code
[08:21:20] <Cork> so you're refactoring code you don't understand...
[08:21:21] <newbie666> made it in a rush
[08:21:25] <Cork> that's scary
[08:21:45] <newbie666> well i made it, so in my head i understand what it *should* do
[08:21:48] <Cork> andri_: don't ask to ask, or for someone
[08:21:50] <newbie666> but i get what you mean
[08:22:17] <newbie666> is there an exepert here you can answer the eternal "is there a santa clauuuuuus" question ?
[08:22:56] <AdamPDotty> Yes, there is.
[08:23:02] <newbie666> yeeeey\
[08:23:06] <newbie666> thank you MR. Expert
[08:24:46] <Konfuzius> Is that a statement of fact AdamPDotty  or may I call upon you with my musings?
[08:26:21] <newbie666> it's a fact man
[08:26:23] <newbie666> don't argue
[08:26:32] <newbie666> or ur gonna get on santa's naughty list
[09:09:46] <tilerendering> ppl, I have no idea how to read the currently selected value out of this: https://pastebin.com/Af19g1tW
[09:11:38] <AdamPDotty> Tried $('ul').val() ?
[09:11:59] <AdamPDotty> ah maybe not with data-val
[09:12:02] <AdamPDotty> then again why?
[09:12:50] <tilerendering> AdamPDotty: why not $(“siteLang”). val() ? but it yields undefined
[09:13:02] <tilerendering> the id is not “ul”
[09:13:11] <tilerendering> that’s why I dont try it this way.
[09:13:37] <AdamPDotty> Could still go the old way: ul.options[ul.selectedIndex].getAttribute('data-val')
[09:15:00] <AdamPDotty> "ul" is valid css, "siteLang" may be not
[09:15:24] <tilerendering> AdamPDotty: still, ul is not a uniquely identified element here. so where would I include that code?
[09:15:32] <Cork> .val() only works on form elements not ul
[09:15:47] <AdamPDotty> oh, its not a select
[09:15:51] <AdamPDotty> should look first
[09:16:06] <AdamPDotty> so how is there a selected value?
[09:16:46] <AdamPDotty> $('#siteLag').find('ul') might be unique.
[09:16:49] <tilerendering> guys, I just need to know if there s a simple way to read the value out. i m in a kind of a hurry, because the time I m spending on finding out how to read and write to the widgets (or any control via js) that I get handed over by the frontend developer is by now already heavily rubbing on the upper limit of where I d be better off learning css myself and doing the whole frontend alone
[09:16:49] <AdamPDotty> n
[09:17:39] <AdamPDotty> yeah, always an idea to ask someone who knows stuff
[09:18:27] <tilerendering> $('#siteLag').find('ul') seems to be unique, but I still dont get the currently selected value
[09:23:37] <tilerendering> ok I give up, I m going to throw that back to the frontend dev and tell him to write a proper documentation or link a proper documentation to the kind of stupid widgets he hands me over. no time for this, I m doing db dev, backend dev nd now frontend logic (jquery) dev at the same time and I getting sick of fumbling around for reading self-evident values out of non-off-the-shelf “controls".
[09:23:57] <tilerendering> + linux administrator + cloud administrator.
[09:24:00] <tilerendering> great, really.

[16:36:33] <gambl0re> have you seen him today? tell him im here
[16:36:46] <taplar> you can literally pm him and tell him yourself
[16:37:16] <gambl0re> just tell him. thanks
[16:37:51] <taplar> not your mailman bro
[16:38:11] <grapheti> PM him does not compute.
[16:39:11] <gambl0re> you guys are like best friends.
[16:39:21] <gambl0re> so if you see him, tell him i'm looking for him
[16:39:29] <taplar> doesn't mean i'm required to do your bidding
[16:40:01] <taplar> you can easily pm him.  he can read the logs.  literally no reason for me to help promote the weird stalker behaviour
[16:42:56] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re uh
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> did you need something?
[16:43:31] <gambl0re> whats up, hows going?
[16:43:36] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:07:24] <gambl0re> im not getting serialize() to work
[17:07:33] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[17:08:02] <grapheti> He thought you'd never ask.
[17:08:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:08:27] <gambl0re> i sent you the fiddle last time!
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:08:35] <gambl0re> it was a codepen
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't keep links to things long-term.
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> make a new one.
[17:08:49] <robertmaxrees> *links to fiddles and codepens and stuff
[17:08:53] <gambl0re> it took me forneever to create that o
[17:08:56] <grapheti> You don't bookmark every link you click? Gasp.
[17:08:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:09:01] <robertmaxrees> srs
[17:09:04] <grapheti> :P
[17:11:23] <robertmaxrees> lolwtf
[17:11:26] <robertmaxrees> this channel sometimes.
[19:08:29] <ngharo> but my backup is the collective memory of this channel
[19:23:12] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[20:08:26] <mrush> if im trying to use fp, should i make every miniscule task into a function
[20:08:35] <mrush> or is that going too far
[20:09:22] <rbw> hello!! what's the best way to serialize a form to be grouped by table row (where each row sharing field names) ?
[20:12:42] <rbw> I want something like this serialized: [ {'name': 'name1', 'addr': 'addr1'}, {'name': 'name2', 'addr': 'addr2'} ]
[20:13:10] <SylvanCyborg> it almost is, just make those double quotes
[20:13:29] <SylvanCyborg> JSON.stringify ?
[20:13:47] <rbw> sorry, I meant "this is how I want the form serialized" ;)
[20:14:07] <rbw> (with double quotes)
[20:15:05] <SylvanCyborg> https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[20:15:26] <SylvanCyborg> and then you can run it though JSON.stringify
[20:15:53] <SylvanCyborg> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[20:17:34] <Seven_Si1_Two> I've got an array from a jquery .find call called allCharts. It contains a canvas element, and a .panel-heading div that I can get results for. In this pastebin, I'm trying to also get the legend, but all that's being printed for the console.log is legend: {"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"context":{},"length":1},"context":{},"selector":".legend"}     https://pastebin.com/VCJ2z9hh
[20:17:53] <rbw> SylvanCyborg: sweet, thanks :)
[20:18:38] <rbw> SylvanCyborg: worked just fine. how the fsck does JSON.stringify know how to serialize this?
[20:19:15] <rbw> I mean, JSON.stringify() is like non-jquery aware, isn't it?
[20:21:02] <rbw> perhaps it looks at the order and name of each item and groups properties together.. but that'd be pretty inefficient, and unsafe. wouldn't it?
[20:21:45] <rbw> hmm.. oh well, it works :]
[20:22:18] <SylvanCyborg> rbw: what do u need to serialize it for?
[20:24:06] <SylvanCyborg> rbw: that JSON stuff is suprisingly small for what it does
[20:24:58] <SylvanCyborg> but it's rock solid
[20:25:40] <rbw> why serialize? because I need to pass it to my backend in a proper format
[20:26:00] <rbw> ok, cool
[21:31:12] <RM982> do functions like get or load work with external urls? like http://somedomain/page
[21:32:38] <SylvanCyborg> RM982: should work usually
[21:33:02] <RM982> I'm actually trying it, remote url is not loading, but I don't get any error either
[21:33:17] <RM982> let me do a test case
[21:37:03] <RM982> https://jsfiddle.net/053meomu/19/
[21:43:26] <RM982> SylvanCyborg: any idea?
[21:47:51] <SylvanCyborg> RM982: add jquery to the fiddle
[21:48:24] <SylvanCyborg> where is says No-Library, make it jquery
[21:50:17] <RM982> did it already  JavaScript + jQuery 3.3.1
[21:50:38] <RM982> SylvanCyborg:
[21:52:24] <SylvanCyborg> yep works
[21:52:42] <SylvanCyborg> gives me ssl warning
[21:52:48] <SylvanCyborg> but i see the alert
[21:53:01] <SylvanCyborg> so you should make sure to use ssl for best results
[21:53:44] <RM982> SylvanCyborg: yeah I see the alert too, but the html is not loading
[21:54:20] <RM982> maybe I need to load it in an iframe or something?
[21:55:18] <SylvanCyborg> yeah, blocking content because it's not ssl
[21:56:04] <SylvanCyborg> also CORS is blocking it
[21:56:59] <RM982> https doesn't work wither
[21:57:31] <RM982> *either
[22:02:28] <RM982> I don't think these functions work with external urls
[22:04:51] <SylvanCyborg> RM982: https://jsfiddle.net/SylvanCyborg/uj9yacxp/1/
[22:05:20] <SylvanCyborg> u need the server to allow u access (CORS) this example allows access, it's just for testing
[22:05:43] <SylvanCyborg> RM982: open your console and refresh, it will show data from that url
[22:07:09] <RM982> SylvanCyborg: I'm afraid I get nothing
[22:08:07] <RM982> oh wait I get it on chrome
[22:08:16] <RM982> FF returns nothing
[22:08:40] <RM982> anyway ty
[22:09:16] <SylvanCyborg> so like once you can data from the url, you can do whatever you need, like place it into the page
[22:09:52] <SylvanCyborg> if you cannot access the url with js, you may need to set up your own server side proxy thing, like in php, and then have js read from your own domain
[22:10:09] <SylvanCyborg> php can rip the content from any url with no permission required
[22:11:58] <RM982> alright, let me ask about of the other part of my problem...let's say the url I want to load generates content via javascript after the DOMContentLoaded event is triggered
[22:12:06] <RM982> Can I still get that content this way?
[22:13:01] <SylvanCyborg> i would not expect any js to run on the page you are consuming, you would have to do run the js on the host page after you load in the content
[22:13:38] <SylvanCyborg> i recommend getting just pure data from an api url rather than getting html page with js in it
[22:13:55] <SylvanCyborg> like how that sample api works, it just gives you some pure data
[22:16:20] <RM982> alright ty
[22:43:12] <Solifugus> Using a jQuery-ui dialog, is there some way to pass a parameter into a button's function?
[22:44:31] <Solifugus> I am dynamically creating the buttons...  buttons:{ one:myfunc, two:myfunc, three:myfunc }   <-- how might I pass parameters to myfunc ??
[22:45:49] <Solifugus> I tried arrow notation which gives all my data but no way to figure out which data goes with which button.. because with the same myfunc, I have no idea what button I came from.
[22:46:06] <Solifugus> Or, is there a way to figure out what button lead to whatever function i am in?
