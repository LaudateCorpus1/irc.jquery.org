[06:54:56] <IHasFingers> hi guys
[10:13:59] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/5e - for some reason when at a certain position it will jump between the two headers (one that is position fixed and one that it is hiding)
[10:14:10] <robertparkerx> I don't really know what to do to stop it
[10:18:22] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx probably because your classes are changing the positions of things./
[10:19:23] <robertparkerx> yes
[10:19:28] <robertparkerx> I just realized that :(
[10:26:29] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx are you trying to scroll the window to a specific element?
[10:28:01] <robertparkerx> http://mild:mild@malmohusmaklarna180412-939-367732270.dev3.mildmedia-dev.eu/till-salu/ljungstersvgen-12a-vbcaja/
[10:28:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:28:12] <robertparkerx> if you scroll down a little bit, slowly you see it
[10:28:24] <robertparkerx> oh
[10:28:33] <robertparkerx> no I'm not
[10:29:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the page "jump between two headers",but I am seeing strange things happen when you get to the navbar section.
[10:29:50] <robertmaxrees> just find a sticky plugin instead of doing it yourself.
[10:30:03] <robertmaxrees> anyway, talk atcha later.
[10:32:42] <robertparkerx> what if I hid the top a little before
[10:32:51] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have the same issues.
[10:32:58] <robertparkerx> crap
[10:33:07] <robertmaxrees> also: you're selecting in the scroll handler and not debouncing.
[10:33:11] <robertmaxrees> just find a plugin.
[10:33:45] <robertmaxrees> the more stuff you slap into place here, the worse perf is going to get.  once of the few few places you can actually create performance problems is in scroll handlers.
[10:33:53] <robertmaxrees> so just find a plugin for this and wash your hands of it.
[10:42:12] <robertparkerx> it seems like it is the other sticky header and not the one I am creating
[10:48:34] <robertparkerx> I got it
[10:48:39] <robertparkerx> it was the css
[10:48:57] <robertparkerx> I changed from display none on other sticky header to position: relative
[10:48:59] <robertparkerx> and it worked
