[00:01:43] <coldhead> i'd hardly call all this nonsense "viable"
[00:01:53] <coldhead> all the real work is being done on google hangouts
[00:02:01] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/FjzNC/
[00:02:14] <tw2113> jquery library work or support?
[00:02:34] <azbyin> thats basically from http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/js/jquery.scrollTo-min.js
[00:02:37] <coldhead> both
[00:03:09] <tw2113> i'd call 775 people including bots pretty busy for an IRC channel
[00:03:18] <azbyin> and it works fine in chrome and firefox
[00:03:27] <juha_> coldhead: i'm still using google wave for productive work
[00:04:51] <azbyin> i want to do the same scroll to element animation, but in a very simple way, eg:  $('body').animate({"scrollTop":$("#myel").offset().top}, 1000, function(){console.log("complete!");});
[00:05:17] <azbyin> but $('body').animate works in webkit, while $('html').animate works in ff
[00:05:37] <coldhead> i'm on google buzz myself, juha_
[00:05:42] <azbyin> and this jquery plugin works in both browsers. I want to know how
[00:05:58] <azbyin> i think it is somehow guessing which element to scroll?
[00:06:09] <azbyin> i mean the container
[00:06:54] <ryanseddon> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12287 filed
[00:08:40] <juha_> coldhead: can i friend you in myspace?
[00:09:43] <azbyin> coldhead, any ideas? i'm pretty sure it is in the d.fn._scrollable func
[00:09:45] <Pitel_laptop> I need to insert clearing div after each 3rd item. problem is, I am dynamicaly appending those items. How to do that? Is there some DOM change event or something?
[00:13:03] <coldhead> no idea, azbyin
[00:13:18] <coldhead> i'm very busy sending cow orkers links to gifs of fatties dancing
[00:14:42] <juha_> also i've heard it's coldies first day
[00:14:54] <azbyin> why? you planned to be lazy on ekka ?
[00:15:22] <stygyan> coldhead, would you share?
[00:19:13] <granden> If I have an .each to iterate over a lot of stuff. How can I tell when it is ready to run one thing when it has iterated over verything?
[00:21:36] <coldhead> put the code after the .each() ? it will have completed by then
[00:21:59] <granden> coldhead: It will? Wont start running that before it is done?
[00:22:51] <zapsoda> http://www.ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/    for someone the main scrolls down to this: http://fennec.name/upload/fennecsite.align.png Any ideas why?
[00:22:57] <coldhead> it shouldn't, granden
[00:23:04] <granden> Ok, cool.
[00:23:04] <coldhead> unless you are using AJAX within the each
[00:23:13] <granden> No only building a string.
[00:23:18] <granden> Ok cool, thanks
[00:23:21] <coldhead> no problemlo then!
[00:23:23] <coldhead> good luck
[00:24:00] <granden> Hmm
[00:24:16] <coldhead> show us the code, little fella
[00:25:44] <granden> Got another problem.
[00:25:46] <granden> :)
[00:25:50] <zapsoda> coldhead, are you talking to me?
[00:26:06] <granden> How do I convert any åäö to aao?
[00:26:09] <coldhead> i welcome code from all little fellas, zapsoda
[00:26:21] <coldhead> granden: ugh
[00:26:59] <granden> I show you teh code :)
[00:27:09] <zapsoda> can you see the code on ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout   or should i upload to pastebin? my problum is that the main content is showing up like this: http://fennec.name/upload/fennecsite.align.png for some people and idk how to fix it :'(
[00:27:09] <coldhead> granden: http://dense13.com/blog/2009/05/03/converting-string-to-slug-javascript/
[00:28:32] <coldhead> i don't see what the problem is
[00:28:42] <coldhead> do you have a shot of how it should look for gombarison?
[00:29:05] <granden> http://pastebin.com/eEUfzZWm
[00:29:13] <zapsoda> well on that he has like five blank lines on the bottom
[00:29:40] <granden> Ah
[00:29:44] <granden> coldhead: Cool, thanks.
[00:30:55] <coldhead> zapsoda: i gather it's miscalculating the size of the content within the slidery bit
[00:30:59] <coldhead> not sure how to fix that
[00:31:40] <coldhead> but unrelatedly, if the code you have for $(window).load() and $(window).resize() is the same you could just do $(window).resize(...).trigger('resize')
[00:31:45] <coldhead> to make it happen the first time
[00:32:48] <coldhead> zapsoda: this project seems pretty active on github: https://github.com/malihu/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin
[00:33:09] <coldhead> if you can create a testcase on jsfiddle you can link to that there :\
[00:33:17] <coldhead> file an issue, as the young people say
[00:33:52] <zapsoda> ill try coldhead
[00:34:35] <coldhead> zapsoda: they'll want to know browser versions, i can't reproduce that with any of mine :(
[00:34:38] <juha_> granden: str.replace("åäö", "aao")
[00:34:47] <coldhead> juha_: >: |
[00:35:35] <zapsoda> Yha i can reproduce it on mine either only the person who im making it for does it happen 2 he says firefox auara 1400x1200
[00:36:00] <juha_> granden: there might be character encoding issues, so make sure everything (code, input, the moon) is in utf8 or at least using same encoding
[00:37:39] <tw2113> *downsizes in all the domains*
[00:38:59] <coldhead> zapsoda: aurora is a development build, if that's the only browser it's happening you're better to wait for them to fix aurora
[00:39:05] <coldhead> (it wasn't broken in my aurora)
[00:39:07] <granden> juha_: That is enough to do a string convertion?
[00:39:26] <granden> Will try it then.
[00:39:38] <tw2113> mmm Aurora
[00:39:49] <tw2113> it's my daily browser
[00:39:51] <juha_> granden: yes and no, if you have "lolol åäö", it will convert it to "lolol aao", but it wont convert "å ä ö"
[00:39:53] <tw2113> screw the stable build
[00:40:03] <juha_> granden: so use coldheads link
[00:40:19] <granden> juha_: Oh ok
[00:40:26] <granden> Then coldheads link will suit me better.
[00:40:32] <granden> But thanks for the extra input
[00:40:42] <juha_> granden: unfortunately replace does not support arrays so you have you have to use a loop to get all characters converted
[00:48:44] <zapsoda> coldhead, its happening to them when they use chrome also
[00:49:45] <zapsoda> Browsers on 2 different computers, one on Linux/XFCE, one on NetBSD/i3wm
[00:50:11] <zapsoda> One 1800x1600
[00:50:12] <zapsoda>  One 1400x1200 And also happens on my netbook 1366x720
[00:50:37] <zapsoda> Not my words
[00:51:24] <Jennifer23> my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/1/ ,i want 2 color input field when input text is wrong, but all input fields are coloring if one is wrong, how can i manage particular input and its text area in my jquery?
[00:51:37] <granden> Got this, $('.varor').each(function(index){ but how could I change it to only select elements that has display not set to none;
[00:51:55] <zapsoda> now they say Actually this has a far more bad issue, scrolling down makes the text all disappear.
[00:52:02] <Jennifer23> and my other ques is, jQuery.getJSON(url, function(data) {}) .error(function() { alert("error"); }) is not given error massage when url is wrong, wts the problem here and how can i do it?
[00:52:09] <Mazon> why does this return 0: $("<div id=\"one\"><div>").find('div#one').length ? - I dont understamd why I can't get the first named div ?
[00:52:38] <NodeX> Jennifer23 : getJSON is async iirc
[00:53:32] <coldhead> zapsoda: i'm testing in chrome on linux and it works for me. so it's not even the browser + os but some specifc browser||some specific OS
[00:53:39] <coldhead> who tests in BSD, seriously
[00:53:42] <coldhead> what a sorry story
[00:53:52] <mazzachre> How do I compare 2 selections to see if they contain the same element?
[00:53:52] <NodeX> forget me, it inherits promise(), my mistake
[00:53:53] <tw2113> opera users, coldhead ?
[00:54:20] <coldhead> Mazon: it's not contained in anything. find() searches CHILDREN, it doesn't start with the current element
[00:55:01] <coldhead> this would work: $('<div><div id=foo"></div></div>').find('#foo') that works
[00:55:29] <coldhead> you might want $('whatever').find('#foo').andSelf().filter('#foo').length
[00:55:32] <coldhead> which ew
[00:55:40] <Mazon> coldhead, ok, thanks. I just saw this: only descendants are considered candidates for the match
[00:56:01] <Mazon> I think I have a workaround - I just needed the clue
[00:56:02] <coldhead> that is some nicely written documentation
[00:56:02] <Mazon> thanks
[00:56:07] <coldhead> good luck buddy!
[00:56:27] <coldhead> mazzachre: do you already know the elemtn?
[00:56:33] <coldhead> element*
[00:57:00] <Mazon> coldhead: $("<div/>").append("<div id=\"one\"><div>").find('#one') :)
[00:58:03] <coldhead> less gross! good work
[00:59:17] <mazzachre> coldhead: Ya, I have 2 selections, I want to know if they contain the same element... Something like var blub1 = $('#moo'), blub2 = $('.cow'); $.isTheSameElement?(blub1, bulb2) Or whatever :D
[01:01:06] <mazzachre> coldhead: (The elements to compare are $(this) and a selection I have saved as data on another element... But I have made a crude test to see that both elements are infact the same... So now I just need to test that in javascript...
[01:04:12] <devslash> hey guys
[01:04:23] <devslash> who is using firefox
[01:05:28] <quicksilver> mazzachre: you can compare DOM objects for equality. Not jQuery objects though. You have to understand the difference.
[01:05:42] <quicksilver> if (this == $('.cow')[0]) { ... for example
[01:05:57] <quicksilver> you need to be sure .cow will only match a single element of course.
[01:06:45] <mazzachre> Ah.. these is an "is" function... That seems to do it...
[01:07:36] <quicksilver> not at all, no
[01:07:42] <quicksilver> although it might work for your case
[01:09:21] <Jennifer23> and my other ques is,$.getJSON(url, function() {}) .error(function() { alert("error"); }) is not given error massage when url is wrong, wts the problem here and how can i do it?
[01:09:33] <mazzachre> quicksilver: It seems to work at least... I do if(this.is($('#saved').data('saved')) { ... } and ... only gets there if the element saved is "this"
[01:09:34] <NodeX> troll
[01:10:04] <Jennifer23> sorry for ask again, my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/1/ ,i want 2 color input field when input text is wrong, but all input fields are coloring if one is wrong, how can i manage particular input and its text area in my jquery?
[01:14:41] <coldhead> good luck you dear souls
[01:15:51] <quicksilver> mazzachre: right. just read the docs, its clear enough :)
[01:16:17] <quicksilver> mazzachre: it checks if any element in your object matches any element described by the argument
[01:16:24] <quicksilver> mazzachre: if you only have 1 in each then, yes, that's equality.
[01:17:22] <stefuNz> hey. i'm binding a click event on some element and then performing some kind of slideout or fadein or something else for 1500 millisec. when the user clicks very fast and very often, the event will get triggered alot, causing the user interface to appear doing the animation infinitely. i'm sure you know this behaviour. how can i fix that ?
[01:20:01] <quicksilver> cancel the old animation(s) before you start new ones?
[01:20:58] <stefuNz> you mean with http://api.jquery.com/stop/ ?
[01:22:14] <stefuNz> ha. just saw this tutorial. seems to be exactly what i mean: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/01/quick-tip-prevent-animation-queue-buildup#
[01:22:21] <stefuNz> thanks quicksilver for the right hint
[01:23:47] <granden> Hmm, something I run hide() on is still being selected when using :visible.
[01:23:53] <granden> Should i be like that?
[01:34:44] <quicksilver> granden: are you use the 'animated' version of hide()? with a duration?
[01:35:20] <mazzachre> quicksilver: Yes, I read that... and yes, I only have one element in each selector, which may or may not be the same... I only want the function to run if they are the same (As it updates some related element... And it is weird if it updates it with wrong data :D)
[01:38:12] <granden> quicksilver: No
[01:39:08] <quicksilver> granden: no. that's not expected.

[01:55:05] <codeperl> Hi all. I need to measure the width of a html tag, suppose <div id="#super"></div>. This tag contains form elements and other tags. Now, the main tag has no width defined in css. But i need to measure the width dynamically. how can i do it?
[01:56:27] <gheatza> hi, anyone familier with clueTip
[01:56:35] <faraway> codeperl: .val() returns the value of the first matching element, and with the selector you have you get more then one element, and not the one that blurs
[01:57:19] <codeperl> @faraway, thanks for response.
[02:04:23] <wewew> ok the culprit was jquery ui, 1.8.21 vs 1.8.22 oh well.
[02:05:28] <Jennifer23> can someone please help me with my question?
[02:07:45] <ravenzz> Jennifer23 you should replace $('.v-input') with $(this)
[02:08:33] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/2/
[02:09:25] <ravenzz> you should add labels for that form fields anyway
[02:09:42] <kai> hey folks. I'm trying to create a drag&drop gui element where I want nested sortables that are also droppables
[02:10:07] <kai> but for some reason my nested sortable never receives drops
[02:10:32] <kai> I've set it to being droppable, but that doesn't seem to be helping
[02:10:54] <walidvb> hi guys!i'm building a site that consists basically of projects, each with images. the idea is a huge grid in which you navigate. up/down->switch project, left/right->navigate within image.
[02:11:20] <kai> I don't seem to get "over" events on the nested sortable either
[02:11:53] <walidvb> i thought i would do it simply using two nested cycle plugins. only 'issue' is the slideshow has to be full screen(although I don't really think that is an issue.)
[02:11:54] <kai> is there something funny going on when droppables are also sortables?
[02:12:12] <walidvb> any thoughts?
[02:13:10] <Jennifer23> ravenzz, thnx, its ok for input, but it particular textarea couldn't get the value.
[02:13:14] <fgro> hi folks. i'd like to enter text into an input field and press enter using javascript... how to? i can use .val() and then trigger a keydown event, but it doesnt work for me:  keypress_script = "$('input#token-input-text_tags').val('mytag'); var e = $.Event('keydown', { keyCode: 13 }); $('input#token-input-text_tags').trigger(e);"
[02:14:09] <fgro> any ideas?
[02:14:51] <Jennifer23> ravenzz, i want 2 input value add its particular textarea
[02:15:45] <ravenzz> Jennifer23 uhm I don't understand what you mean
[02:17:34] <aaronj_> I'm using bootstrap-image-gallery.js (https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/blob/master/js/bootstrap-image-gallery.js) trying to trigger fullscreen when the user clicks on the image, then load the modal
[02:17:45] <aaronj_> I can get the fullscreen to trigger but the modal never loads after that
[02:17:52] <aaronj_> http://jsfiddle.net/mYSBS/
[02:18:01] <ravenzz> #twitter-bootstrap for bootstrap related questions
[02:18:05] <Jennifer23> ravenzz, if you type matching text(tin) in input field, then it add the value of its textarea automatically
[02:18:08] <aaronj_> ravenzz: cool, thanks
[02:18:09] <walidvb_> hi guys!i'm building a site that consists basically of projects, each with images. the idea is a huge grid in which you navigate. up/down->switch project, left/right->navigate within image.
[02:18:13] <walidvb_> i thought i would do it simply using two nested cycle plugins. only 'issue' is the slideshow has to be full screen(although I don't really think that is an issue.)
[02:19:22] <ravenzz> Jennifer23 ok that is a pretty simple task. Which means that you don't have any clue on how to do basic stuffs with jquey. You would probably read this http://jqfundamentals.com/ then
[02:19:22] <Jennifer23> ravenzz, line 5 of http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/1/
[02:20:27] <ravenzz> walidvb_ i think that there is a plugin for that, but I don't remember the name...try to google a bit
[02:21:22] <ravenzz> walidvb_ maybe this http://jquerytools.org/demos/scrollable/site-navigation.html
[02:23:11] <aaronj_> ravenzz: I suspect my question isn't bootstrap specific but something about my not understanding event handling completely in jQuery
[02:23:35] <ttuser> hey guys, just a small question: is there any remarkable difference (e.g. performance?) between $('<div>').text('foobar').attr('id',123).css('foo','bar'); and $('div id="123" style="foo: bar;"></div>') ?
[02:24:15] <walidvb_> ravenzz: sounds good. I already fiddled a proto, but it seems this will do as well. ;)
[02:25:40] <miCSu> ttuser: not sure but I'd guess the first one has to do operations while the second's the attributes already included
[02:26:00] <tehcyx> is this a bug, that fail is called? http://jsfiddle.net/xrqzj/2/
[02:27:56] <miCSu> should it be inside $(document).ready or such? (haven't used much ajax myself)
[02:28:08] <walidvb_> ravenzz: i will be loading full screen images(high res), so i'm thinking of putting all images of a project on display:none, so that it would only load the images when a project is opened. do you think that is a good solution?
[02:28:14] <ttuser> hmm is there any way i can dertermine the better way of creating elements?
[02:28:22] <aaronj_> when you add an event handler does it override the original event, when does it get called, before or after the original event's function?
[02:28:23] <tehcyx> on the left side i sepcified onDOMReady so it's executed when (document).ready
[02:28:43] <aaronj_> s/add an event handler/call an event handler/ (I think)
[02:29:03] <ravenzz> walidvb_ that won't work. the images will be loaded anyway
[02:29:19] <ravenzz> and then hidden by display: none
[02:29:57] <fgro> is it possible to chain event triggers? say $("some_id").trigger(event_1).trigger(event_2); ?
[02:30:06] <ravenzz> load thumbnails instead, or (better solution) start with a bunch of links to the images
[02:30:06] <J23> ravenzz, yes i am a new to jquery, trying my best to understand it, right now i just want the value entered in the inputbox to be put into the textarea right below it
[02:30:10] <ravenzz> your basic markup
[02:30:38] <ravenzz> and load only the active project ones (replace the links with images)
[02:31:07] <tehcyx> J23: $('#idoftextarea').text($('#idofinputbox').val());
[02:31:17] <ravenzz> say the first 3, and when you navigate the project you can preload the others
[02:32:30] <ravenzz> this way you will save data transfer (which means money)
[02:32:37] <ravenzz> somehow :)
[02:33:14] <ravenzz> J23 if you learn how things works, you can do pretty awesome stuffs on your own
[02:33:20] <ravenzz> without asking people
[02:34:07] <peterschmidler> I would like to fadein all elements on a page with a certain class after each other but my script doesn't work. Any help would be highly appreciated. http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx
[02:34:17] <J23> ravenzz, i think i know the basic, this is a bit complicated
[02:34:38] <ravenzz> it isn't
[02:34:42] <walidvb_> ravenzz: sry was on the phone, lemme read you ;)
[02:35:14] <ravenzz> walidvb_ yep maybe there are tons of mistakes on my phrases, because of my bad english
[02:35:26] <ravenzz> ?next @ J23
[02:35:28] <bot-t> J23, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[02:36:56] <J23> tehcyx, becoz the textarea id given in array, hence i can't use id
[02:37:41] <walidvb_> but at what point do I replace my links by images? beforeTransition to next project?
[02:37:41] <walidvb_> ravenzz: cause what I thought at some point was to do your solution, and simply call cycle on the inner project when navigating to it. and i'm not sure thumbnails would be of any use in my case
[02:37:43] <J23> like <input class=v[0][0]><itextarea class=v[1][0]>
[02:38:01] <codeperl> http://pastebin.com/kgBd28Bq

[02:38:01] <codeperl> <codeperl> ?
[02:39:57] <tehcyx> is this a jquery bug, that failed is called upon success? http://jsfiddle.net/xrqzj/4/
[02:41:31] <walidvb_> ravenzz: is that what you meant? replace my links by images on beforeTransition to next project?
[02:41:56] <peterschmidler> Problem solved!
[02:42:36] <Tram> Hello all, i have a question. I have a class that is a ul, and has loads of li items. I want to be able to select all li items from position 20 and above, anyone knows how i can do that?
[02:42:54] <quicksilver> ?gt @ Tram
[02:42:55] <bot-t> Tram, :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[02:43:49] <Tram> thanks quicksilver!
[02:43:54] <Tram> do you know if this works on css aswell?
[02:44:03] <Tram> i mean as a CSS selector
[02:46:21] <ravenzz> walidvb_ http://jsfiddle.net/V5zhJ/
[02:47:20] <quicksilver> Tram: pretty sure it's jquery-only, that one.
[02:47:31] <walidvb_> ravenzz: cheers. that's what i thought, but this would have to be called on transition to that project, right?
[02:47:38] <quicksilver> Tram: there is nth-child and there might be other things in CSS3 but they're probably not widely supported.
[02:47:50] <walidvb_> so, as a callback option of the plugin's beforetransition.
[02:48:32] <Tram> quicksilver: thanks!
[02:48:35] <ravenzz> what plugin are you talking about?
[02:48:39] <ravenzz> the jquery ui tools one?
[02:49:05] <walidvb_> ravenzz: hm it seems the best choice, but cycle does seem a bit easier to configure
[02:49:29] <walidvb_> although i would have to set the keyboard shortcuts myself, and so on.
[02:49:35] <J23> ravenzz,  im trying  $this.next('textarea').text($this.val); but its not getting the value, http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/3/
[02:49:49] <walidvb_> ravenzz: but it goes pretty fast, actually.. http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UptvP/
[02:51:33] <walidvb_> i just need to play around with callbacks, and un/binding events on navigation
[02:52:01] <ravenzz> walidvb_ well I would do that myself, It shouldn't be that hard. you can use the mousetrap js library http://craig.is/killing/mice or just bind the keydown events
[02:52:16] <walidvb_> ravenzz: i'll go with that, then.
[02:52:32] <walidvb_> ravenzz: and i should really focus on performance once i have the thing working :D
[02:52:37] <ravenzz> and as I said. if each project has a lot of images
[02:53:03] <seutje> J23: http://jsfiddle.net/UVpzp/5/
[02:53:05] <ravenzz> don't load all of them at once
[02:53:24] <seutje> J23: .val on jQuery collections is a function and needs to be executed, hence the () I added
[02:53:29] <walidvb_> it probably does. i think i'll go with a masterCycle, and when you navigate to a project, call cycle on it. seems like the best bet, imo
[02:53:32] <walidvb_> ravenzz: thanks for your advice
[02:53:40] <ravenzz> load the first 4 or 5 and when the user navigates horizontally load the others
[02:53:48] <walidvb_> exactly
[02:53:48] <seutje> J23: .next on that $this gets you the <br/>, filtering that on textarea returns an empty set, changed it to nextAll()
[02:53:58] <walidvb_> i'll try and get this done today
[02:54:01] <walidvb_> bye!!
[02:54:07] <ravenzz> great
[02:54:12] <ravenzz> good luck with that
[02:55:08] <ravenzz> J23 because the next element is a <br>
[02:55:15] <J23> seutje, thanks a lot
[02:55:18] <ravenzz> use nextAll
[02:55:43] <ravenzz> or $(this).parent().find('textarea)
[02:55:51] <J23> ravenzz, thanks a lot
[02:55:55] <ravenzz> I don't know which is faster
[02:56:29] <VectorX> obviously its superman
[02:56:48] <ravenzz> :D
[02:57:32] <VectorX> although you cant really be faster than a speeding bullet, coz a bullete would be decelerating
[02:57:53] <VectorX> there goes most peoples childhoods
[03:05:16] <eugenmayer> hello. Any easy way to do something like $(':header').notInXpath('.someContainer')
[03:06:08] <eugenmayer> So basically, check the xpath for a matched element to not include a specific parent (up to the root)
[03:07:51] <moijk> I got a webapp that has several subpages. since they share so many controls i want to load the main part dynamically. but does that mean that any css links, javascript libs etc that need to be loaded need to be loaded in the main page, and not dynamically when needed? (I guess you can't unload anything when loaded?)
[03:08:00] <eugenmayer> parent?
[03:09:59] <moijk> there are no frames to be parents or childs of. or has parent got new meaning?
[03:12:55] <moijk> seems like only events can be unloaded, not libs. while i could make unload (by removing all functions and variables) that's more work than the overhead of having everything loaded at boot.
[03:13:17] <walidvb_> quick question: if i call $('.nextPager', $('#thisCycle')), only .nextPager WITHIN #thisCycle wil be returned, right?
[03:16:39] <J23> if i get the data using getJSON(url, function() { }) , how can i get error massage when given url is wrong? im using this .error(function() { alert("error"); }); but it not getting the error
[03:19:11] <shoky> J23: that should work
[03:22:43] <beefz0r> Hello people
[03:23:53] <tehcyx> can someone confirm this as a jquery bug? http://jsfiddle.net/xrqzj/4/
[03:24:04] <faraway> J23: do you use jsonp ?
[03:25:06] <faraway> tehcyx: no it's not a bug "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://jsfiddle.net/. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[03:25:46] <faraway> tehcyx: post requests can only be done to the same origin
[03:25:46] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a form set to onSubmit="return false;" to prevent the form from being submitted when enter is being pressed. But I want to allow submission when the submit-button is clicked. is there some way to do this?
[03:25:56] <tehcyx> faraway: try this on your local pc, in chrome with these parameters:  --allow-cross-origin-auth-prompt --disable-web-security
[03:26:02] <tehcyx> same result
[03:26:30] <shoky> tehcyx: you put a contentType as a dataType
[03:27:12] <shoky> tehcyx: dataType is the type of data that comes back from the server. contentType is the mimetype of the data you're sending
[03:27:28] <ShawnRisk> how do I know make it so if I click on an object it only adds in append code the first time I click this?
[03:28:25] <tehcyx> shoky: thx, made my day
[03:29:33] <J23> faraway, no
[03:31:08] <J23> shoky, actually when i add .success(function() { alert("success"); }) .error(function() { alert("error"); }); its get success alert, but not getting error alert when url is wrong
[03:33:48] <J23> faraway, sorry, i can't understand your ques, i'm use the data which given in getJSON()
[03:34:20] <faraway> J23: is it a cross domain request, that ueses a json-pointer ?
[03:37:19] <beefz0r> is it possible to append something to an attribute using attr() ?
[03:37:35] <beefz0r> Oh never mind
[03:37:36] <NodeX> better to use prop();
[03:38:27] <beefz0r> why is prop better ?
[03:39:11] <peterschmidler> How can I combine this in an each function with an appended class e.g. $(this+' .class').fadeIn(500);
[03:40:18] <peterschmidler> Is this a common way to go? $(this).find('.class').fadeIn(500);
[03:42:18] <seutje> peterschmidler: only if you want to find children of this that have that class
[03:42:30] <seutje> peterschmidler: if you want to filter this based on the class, use filter()
[03:45:12] <J23> faraway, no

[03:57:27] <_ikke_> I have a problem with sortable, but can't seem to recreate it on jsfiddle. I have set sortable on te tbody of table (making the tr's sortable). But as soon as I drag a row, the row turns into a vertical list. Anyone knows what's going on? (http://jsfiddle.net/gz8eT/ here is a bit of the setup, but doesn't show what happens)
[03:58:52] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[03:58:55] <zapsoda> ?
[04:00:36] <ShawnRisk> seutje: thanks
[04:14:10] <sicp> when creating PhoneGap apps, is it common to use jQuery to read from XML for constructing the view (HTML, etc..)?
[04:15:05] <peterschmidler> I would like to check if an element is visible, but it doesn't work. Any clue , anyone? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx
[04:16:35] <quicksilver> peterschmidler: don't see how your code is relevant to your question.
[04:16:41] <quicksilver> but .is(':visible')
[04:17:13] <beefz0r> I got an element with class property : class="cls1 cls2 cls3" how can I get the second class ?
[04:17:18] <peterschmidler> quicksilver: Did I forget to save? Maybe. http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx
[04:19:47] <peterschmidler> Why does .is(':visible' not work in this example: http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx)
[04:20:02] <quicksilver> beefz0r: $(foo).attr('class').split(/\s+/); gives you an array of class names
[04:20:12] <beefz0r> cheers
[04:20:24] <quicksilver> peterschmidler: that still has nothing to do with visible
[04:20:35] <quicksilver> it just calls 'fadeIn' in a loop.
[04:21:18] <peterschmidler> quicksilver: You got an older version of that pen. Anyway I git it working now. Thanks.
[04:25:03] <beefz0r> why does jsfiddler add an invisible "?" at the end ? Is it a bug ?
[04:29:20] <ShawnRisk> Is there a way to disable the A link?  When I click on a video, I got it to autoplay but it is prepending within the a.item, which means that I can still click this.
[04:30:58] <Ring0`> Hi, I can't get this to work. http://pastebin.com/gE3ZzTDx 'Now really loaded' will appear before ajax finish executing. The request must remain async. Why after `wrapping` request into function, promise won't work anymore?
[04:31:41] <beefz0r> what is wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/ZsdbV/
[04:35:16] <ShawnRisk> beefz0r: I don't even know what you are trying
[04:35:37] <beefz0r> the function delrow should make the row invisible
[04:36:32] <jalexandru> beefz0r in fiddle.jshell.net you have an error at line 21 "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'display' of undefined"
[04:36:33] <Ring0`> beefz0r: you try to mix plain javascript and jQuery, proper usage would be $("." + rowcls).css('display', 'none');
[04:38:08] <beefz0r> this doesn't work either : http://jsfiddle.net/ZsdbV/1/
[04:38:10] <peterschmidler> How can I execute a function after a short delay. My examples executes without delay... http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/tBIhr
[04:38:22] <Ring0`> beefz0r: because it's <tr>, replace it with <div> and will work
[04:39:02] <beefz0r> you can't hide a table row ?
[04:39:07] <seutje> beefz0r: tr's are suppose to be in a table
[04:39:22] <seutje> browsers tend to just make something of broken markup
[04:39:25] <beefz0r> oh well they are but not in that jsfiddle sample
[04:39:29] <seutje> in this case: they ignore the wrapper
[04:39:52] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/ZsdbV/4/
[04:39:54] <seutje> works fine
[04:40:23] <Ring0`> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/mp8uD/

[04:40:45] <beefz0r> thanks*
[04:41:20] <ShawnRisk> peterschmidler: 5000 milliseconds is 5 seconds, try to increasing that and see if that helps
[04:41:53] <peterschmidler> ShawnRisk: No difference

[04:43:35] <peterschmidler> seutje: Yes, thanks!
[04:44:16] <seutje> or you could do some queue stuff manually, but I've always found that rather fidgety and weird
[04:45:07] <seutje> peterschmidler: if you don't need to chain, might as well use a regular timeout btw
[04:45:16] <peterschmidler> seutje: How?
[04:45:17] <seutje> you know, as in vanilla javamascripts

[04:46:14] <interop_madness> being a jQuery beginner, is there some kind of LINQs .Where() built into jQuery? e.g. var objects = someMethod(); var someOfThem = $.Where(objects, function(){ return this.author == "johndoe"}); // returns the subset of objects for which author is john doe
[04:46:39] <ShawnRisk> Ring0`: I don't understand what you are asking but might be beyond my skill level.

[04:54:48] <VictorCL> so what happens to the other event?
[04:55:21] <seutje> ShawnRisk: don't think I understand it, are you just trying to disable the default behavior of a.item, even when it's appended at run-time?
[04:55:31] <seutje> VictorCL: first bound gets fired first afaik
[04:56:11] <seutje> $('.foo').bind('someEvent', function() {  /* I fire first */ }).bind('someEvent', function() { /* I fire second */ });

[04:57:41] <juria_roberts> thanks i forgot the single quotes
[04:58:01] <seutje> you don't need to quote the actual name unless it has funky characters or spaces or anything like that afaik
[04:58:23] <seutje> I usually do though, keep shit consistent and weed out annoying bugs

[05:01:12] <ShawnRisk> seutje: did you see my message?
[05:01:34] <seutje> no`
[05:01:41] <ShawnRisk> seutje: Yes I want to disable the default behaviour after I click the link, I am doing e.preventDefault(); and still the link is clickable.
[05:02:44] <seutje> ShawnRisk: that should do it, unless your not using delegate/live/whateveritisnowadays or if you mean something else by "clickable"
[05:05:33] <ShawnRisk> seutje: $("a.item").one("click", function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); there is more code, but that is what we are talking about, and when I autoplay the video after I click the image, the video can still be clicked to open up the video in a new page.
[05:07:30] <NodeX> one() ?
[05:07:41] <NodeX> shouldn't it be "on()"
[05:07:44] <seutje> ShawnRisk: stabbing in the dark here, but I'm assuming there's an image wrapped in an <a class="item">, this image gets swapped out for a video, still wrapped in the same <a class="item"> and something is attaching a click event handler to that link when the video starts playing
[05:08:14] <NodeX> if it's supposed to be using on() then you have it a little skewiff
[05:08:45] <NodeX> $("a").on('click','.item',function(event){event.preventDefault() ..... });
[05:09:09] <ShawnRisk> seutje: right
[05:09:38] <seutje> well, preventDefault (as its name suggests) only prevent default behaviors, not attached behaviors
[05:11:10] <seutje> not knowing the order the handlers are bound in, stopPropagation might be what you're looking for
[05:11:16] <ak> is there a way, to pass some variable to the $.ajax() success function?
[05:11:29] <seutje> (if the one you're trying to stop was bound before yours, this won't do much afaik)
[05:12:49] <ShawnRisk> seutje: let me try
[05:14:55] <faraway> ak: you always can use the closure capability, or using jQuery.prox with the sucess function and passing a context that holds the variables
[05:16:57] <faraway> ak: or the context ooption of the ajax request itself
[05:18:30] <geekie> Hi, I have set my width of an element in mm, and when I do $('#element').css('width'); I get it back in px, how do I actually get the mm value since that's what it's set with?
[05:18:48] <faraway> ak: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/tZPzy/1/
[05:19:30] <seutje> you can actually use mm?
[05:19:42] <faraway> geekie: you need to convert it yourselfe
[05:19:48] <seutje> that doesn't sound like too much of a good idea tbh
[05:20:19] <seutje> browsers pretty much only understand px, you're lucky they can convert these values that don't really translate across media like that
[05:22:09] <vatzec> I'm trying to select all checked checkboxes and if there are none selected, display an alert box. What's wrong here? onsubmit="javascript:if !( $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length > 0 ) { alert( 'error' ); return false; }"
[05:22:47] <faraway> geekie: create an element with e.g. 1000mm width and height check how many pixels it is in width and height, and then you can convert it
[05:23:41] <faraway> geekie: you should choose a realtive big size to get around inaccuracy
[05:25:53] <ShawnRisk> seutje: here is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/BK9V2/8/ but in my code I am using $("a.item").one("click", function(e) { }); but couldn't make that work here.
[05:27:49] <petoo> hey
[05:28:20] <petoo> I am trying to draw a pie chart , I want a hyperlink  on the labels
[05:28:23] <petoo> how to do this
[05:28:58] <faraway> petoo: how do oyu drwa the pie chart ?
[05:29:27] <petoo> I am using a javascript library jseasy.js , but this was just an experimental thing
[05:29:36] <petoo> so I am open to anything you give me
[05:31:05] <seutje> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/BK9V2/9/
[05:31:16] <Kingsy> is it possible that with .get() it returns all of the markup in the result but doesnt return <script> tags and their contents?
[05:31:28] <seutje> seems better to just check the condition in the handler and bail if it doesn't suffice
[05:31:46] <seutje> Kingsy: it only returns the body content afaik
[05:32:08] <geekie> faraway: Thanks! I'll do that.
[05:32:10] <Kingsy> so why wouldnt it return the <script> elements if they are inline inside the body?
[05:32:11] <faraway> petoo: sorry i don't know this library
[05:32:23] <faraway> geekie: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/QWn29/ ;)
[05:33:00] <seutje> petoo: http://g.raphaeljs.com/ is pretty decent for shit like that
[05:33:03] <petoo> faraway: any other you know of , which would help me exactly the way I want it
[05:33:44] <petoo> seutje: can I provide hyperlink on its label?
[05:33:44] <faraway> petoo: the one seutje sayed or http://code.google.com/p/flot/ which also doues pie charts
[05:33:47] <seutje> since it's essentially just SVG, you can manipulate it however you like, bind handlers, make regular links, whatever floats your boat
[05:34:05] <seutje> you can even fuck it up with CSS! :D
[05:34:18] <beefz0r> mhm is there something wrong ? var onclickold = jQuery(buttons[i]).prop("onclick");
[05:34:18] <faraway> petoo: don't know if you can do hyperlinks on labels, but you can listen on some events
[05:34:35] <petoo> sure faraway , seutje :D
[05:34:36] <petoo> thanks
[05:36:34] <beefz0r> what should I use to set onclick ? attr or prop ?
[05:37:12] <Kingsy> seutje: any ideas?
[05:37:16] <mazzachre> I have a background image that is 10px wide and 20px height, dependant on some logic I want to show only the top 10 by 10px or the bottom 10 by ten pixels... How do I set that in the $.css call?
[05:38:00] <faraway> beefz0r: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:38:09] <mazzachre> The image and other background properties are set in css file... So I don't want to overwrite the entire background
[05:38:19] <tcial> Right, I've called a class like var tpm = new JustGage({ title: "#olympics" });, so how do I change 'title' dynamically, or any time I want?
[05:39:05] <faraway> beefz0r: or is there a special reason why you want to set an event listener via onclick (which you shouldn't do anymore)
[05:39:19] <beefz0r> why shouldn't I ?
[05:39:47] <tcial> beefz0r: Just use $(element).click(function() {});
[05:40:00] <tcial> Nevermind >_< just read it properly
[05:40:41] <hooloovoo> beefz0r: Well, i think the only reason is that it's simpler to understand it if it's with the rest of the javascript. Also you can do some more stuff if you set it in the JS file.
[05:41:58] <beefz0r> can I also put parameters in the function ?
[05:42:22] <seutje> Kingsy: by design afaik
[05:42:23] <beefz0r> $(buttons[5]).click(delrow("class"));
[05:43:03] <faraway> beefz0r: $(buttons[5]).click(function() { delrow("class") });
[05:43:57] <beefz0r> will it show up in onclick or is it hidden ?
[05:44:11] <faraway> beefz0r: it won't show up in onclick
[05:44:19] <beefz0r> okay cheers faraway
[05:46:28] <faraway> beefz0r: if you set event handles with jquery then jquery takes care that no memory leak will happen.
[05:46:39] <seutje> Kingsy: guess I was wrong, if you specify the datatype as html, it should bring them along and evaluate them if you insert them into the DOM
[05:47:09] <beefz0r> memory leaks ? Why would that be ?
[05:48:57] <sicp> if I have a div whose ID is X and another whose ID is Y. Y is a child of X and I want to append (from jQuery) something to the Y div
[05:49:09] <faraway> beefz0r: IE always had problems (don't know up to wich version) that if you add javascript objects directly to dom objects. which had the effect that both where not removed form memory even if the browser window closed
[05:49:12] <sicp> $(#X.Y).append(something); ?
[05:49:54] <ShawnRisk> seutje: thanks, I was able to make this work out so far.  The only problem I see is that youtube videos will not load.  Just to let you know I am using mediaelementjs in all of this too.
[05:51:45] <beefz0r> oh haha I did buttons[i].click instead of jQuery(buttons[i]), it's alot different
[05:52:21] <RandalSchwartz> if you have a div whose ID is Y, that's enough
[05:52:24] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't matter where it is
[05:52:25] <NodeX> sicp : ID's are unique so you dont need to use a child
[05:52:37] <sicp> but I have many divs with the id "content"
[05:52:41] <RandalSchwartz> no you don't
[05:52:43] <RandalSchwartz> not legally
[05:52:47] <sicp> hmmm
[05:52:47] <NodeX> not legally you dont
[05:52:50] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[05:52:53] <RandalSchwartz> stereo speakers :)
[05:52:54] <NodeX> ^ +1
[05:52:59] <NodeX> 7:1
[05:53:08] <sicp> I know that it's an ID..but I mean I can just say "the content that belongs to THIS parent"
[05:53:17] <sicp> it's more practical and less need for unique-ness..
[05:53:26] <RandalSchwartz> first, get rid of your duplicate IDs
[05:53:31] <RandalSchwartz> then talk about what you have left :)
[05:53:31] <sicp> fine, they're gone
[05:53:35] <sicp> but that'll solve it
[05:53:36] <sicp> I don'
[05:53:43] <sicp> I don't want to solve it! I want to sit here for hours!
[05:53:46] <sicp> lol, alright
[05:53:47] <NodeX> lol
[05:53:49] <RandalSchwartz> you can add a class for easy targeting
[05:54:01] <RandalSchwartz> $('#foo .bar').appen()
[05:54:14] <RandalSchwartz> it's a bit of an abuse of classes, but it works
[05:54:21] <NodeX> if you need a child of a parent use $("#x .bar") .... or $(parent).children(selector);
[05:54:53] <faraway> beefz0r: you can do whatever you want, but my recommendation is to use the jQuery functions ;)
[06:00:00] <beefz0r> faraway, I think it won't work with click...
[06:00:41] <faraway> beefz0r: could you make a http://jsfiddle.net  with some comments you want to do ? just a little sample
[06:01:31] <beefz0r> http://jsfiddle.net/VZq2N/ there's no html included, it must be a code error
[06:01:59] <beefz0r> let me add comments, sec
[06:02:57] <beefz0r> http://jsfiddle.net/VZq2N/1/
[06:02:58] <mazzachre> Is there some nice way to move css from one element to another? Something like $('#myelem').cssCopy($('#myotherelem'));?
[06:03:46] <NodeX> console.log($("your-element").css());
[06:03:48] <NodeX> see what it logs
[06:04:05] <mazzachre> NodeX: It throws an exception...
[06:04:18] <mazzachre> NodeX: a is undefined...
[06:05:44] <ShawnRisk> hi NodeX
[06:05:47] <NodeX> you can copy the classes then copy the style prop()
[06:06:37] <NodeX> hi
[06:08:04] <faraway> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/VZq2N/4/
[06:08:08] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: I saw that you were following what I was saying and wondering if you knew how to get youtube videos to work in my code?
[06:08:59] <NodeX> what code
[06:09:04] <faraway> beefz0r: the problem is not the click handler but the problem is that i is not the value you expect
[06:09:18] <beefz0r> well I don't get it, what value will it be then ?
[06:09:50] <mikegolf> hi guys, there's a form I need to submit via ajax to the REST API, thus it requires me to use "PATCH" HTTP method
[06:10:12] <faraway> beefz0r: the value of buttons.length  that because how clousre/scopes work in javascript
[06:10:31] <mikegolf> unfortunately Chromium Inspector says the request method is OPTIONS, even though I've declared type: "PATCH" in .ajax options
[06:10:46] <mikegolf> what is the correct way for sending PATCH requests?
[06:10:56] <NodeX> wrapped in a shart
[06:11:13] <faraway> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/VZq2N/5/
[06:11:15] <NodeX> $("mozilla/browser").send(shart(PATCH));
[06:12:23] <Rovanion> Does $.addClass() add the class even if it exist previously?
[06:12:24] <mikegolf> NodeX trying to be funny or what? :)
[06:12:25] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/BK9V2/9/  right now I have a test video, but if you switch that to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBe4BzImqdM you will see this is not working.
[06:12:40] <NodeX> no, serious
[06:12:55] <NodeX> define "Not working" ?
[06:13:03] <beefz0r> well jQuery(this).parent().parent().attr("class") returns undefined
[06:13:13] <chilversc_> mikegolf: it works fine for me, how did you call jQuery.ajax?
[06:13:34] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: The youtube video will not load.
[06:13:53] <faraway> beefz0r: because the html structure is not correct … he one i added was just a guess ;)
[06:14:21] <quicksilver> mikegolf: unexpected OPTIONS calls are probably cross-domain ajax checks
[06:14:21] <faraway> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/VZq2N/6/
[06:14:45] <quicksilver> mikegolf: e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1256593/jquery-why-am-i-getting-an-options-request-insted-of-a-get-request
[06:15:19] <NodeX> it's not a JS issue
[06:15:27] <erdos> is it possible to create custom events in javascript/jquery?
[06:15:27] <NodeX> certainly not a jquery issue
[06:15:33] <beefz0r> I see , I'll modify it and try :-)
[06:15:56] <mikegolf> quicksilver: thanks, i've forgotten that the API is running different port, which makes it cross-domain :/
[06:16:14] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: are you saying mine is not a jquery issue?
[06:16:18] <erdos> nm
[06:16:23] <erdos> should have googled first :P
[06:16:55] <beefz0r> jsfiddle always adds an invisible question mark, is that a bug ?
[06:17:30] <beefz0r> oooh it works great, awesome faraway , many thanks
[06:17:30] <NodeX> ShawnRisk : yes
[06:17:37] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: okay thanks
[06:17:41] <NodeX> the video wont play with your syntax
[06:17:47] <NodeX> *html*
[06:18:38] <faraway> beefz0r: but you really should look how scopes and closures in javascript work: http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/
[06:19:41] <beefz0r> I know how they work, was that wrong in my code ?
[06:19:49] <faraway> beefz0r: the focus there is not on good code and event handlers or dom manipulation, but look what the thing about closures and scopes is
[06:20:30] <beefz0r> closures is quite new
[06:20:36] <ShawnRisk> one last question if I have multiple videos, how do I make 1 play and than if I click the other, let that one play, but the last video I clicked to back to being an image?
[06:20:43] <faraway> beefz0r: yes that was the problem with your code …. you expected that i was 0 or 1 depending on which button you clicked
[06:21:13] <faraway> beefz0r: but the behavoiur of closures is different so i was the same for every click in your code
[06:21:28] <beefz0r> thanks for the information
[06:21:30] <faraway> beefz0r: look for the "The Infamous Loop Problem"  in the link i showed you
[06:21:47] <beefz0r> faraway, I am
[06:22:15] <faraway> beefz0r: it is exactly the problem you had in your code
[06:23:35] <beefz0r> well that really messes with my mind
[06:24:22] <faraway> beefz0r: thats normal … ;)
[06:24:36] <faraway> beefz0r: but you need to understand that
[06:24:44] <beefz0r> back when I was a huge C# fanboy I didn't have all these problems
[06:25:48] <faraway> beefz0r: well C# also has closures and they work (imho) the same
[06:26:08] <beefz0r> yes but I never had problems like this back then haha
[06:27:37] <faraway> beefz0r: if you understand it it is a really nice feature
[06:27:52] <beefz0r> I guess so
[06:28:24] <beefz0r> by the way, is there a better way to get the first element using a selector ? (I use $(".class")[0])
[06:30:57] <faraway> beefz0r: http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:31:10] <LordThumper> jQuery object: $(".class:first")
[06:31:30] <LordThumper> Element $(".class").eq(0) or $(".class")[0]
[06:31:32] <beefz0r> faraway, eq is basically the same , right ?
[06:32:00] <faraway> beefz0r: the on :eq the genric selector you can use for 0 1 2 3 ….  :first is the mor readyble short cut for the first element
[06:32:12] <LordThumper> eq returns a jquery object too
[06:32:31] <beefz0r> [0] returns an element ?
[06:32:35] <LordThumper> yes
[06:32:45] <LordThumper> same as .get()
[06:33:06] <ShawnRisk> If I click a link and this does an action, how do I restore element to original form if I click a different link?
[06:33:17] <beefz0r> so it's better to use $("sel").eq(0) instead of jQuery($("sel")[0])
[06:33:40] <Kingsy> so if I have a .get() method like this --> jQuery.get(e,{},function(a,b,c){ }); what data type is that set to receive? it doesnt seem to grab script elements
[06:33:41] <LordThumper> If you want a jQuery object yes
[06:33:50] <beefz0r> or $("sel:first") if I want a jquery object
[06:34:02] <LordThumper> yeah
[06:34:10] <beefz0r> thanks LordThumper and faraway
[06:34:18] <LordThumper> np
[06:34:30] <faraway> beefz0r: $("sel:first")  $("sel").first()  is the same
[06:34:46] <faraway> beefz0r: from what is returned
[06:35:22] <SoulRaven> hello
[06:35:34] <SoulRaven> i have a quesion regarding json and xml
[06:35:54] <SoulRaven> what is better to parse some data drom the server to the client
[06:36:00] <SoulRaven> in json format or in xml format
[06:36:25] <SoulRaven> @from
[06:36:52] <NodeX> json is lighter
[06:37:35] <SoulRaven> i undestand, i ask this because the amount of data parsed are prety high
[06:38:05] <SoulRaven> i want to parse like 100.000 points to the client to be placed on the google map
[06:38:06] <beefz0r> how can I change the innerhtml using jquery ?
[06:38:10] <NodeX> clientside parsing is all dependant on clientside RAM
[06:38:18] <faraway> beefz0r: .html
[06:38:46] <faraway> beefz0r: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[06:38:47] <beefz0r> what about appending ?
[06:38:53] <LordThumper> .append
[06:39:02] <LordThumper> or .appendTo
[06:39:05] <Kingsy> oh nm I see.. so it would be jQuery.get(e,{},function(a,b,c){ },"html");
[06:39:52] <Kingsy> hmm no.. that still doesnt return inline script elements with the html ..
[06:40:23] <beefz0r> oh if I use .append() I don't need .html()
[06:40:26] <Kingsy> anyone know what I am missing?
[06:40:41] <faraway> beefz0r: just try and play around ;)
[06:40:53] <beefz0r> I will, I just noticed that
[06:41:30] <MacroMan> Does there happen to be anyone in here that knows any prototypejs? I'm in the #prototype channel, but it's dead.
[06:41:55] <MacroMan> Just need a tiny bit of help with a little code.
[06:42:27] <NodeX> I used to use it, not for a while though
[06:43:16] <MacroMan> OK. I'm just trying to do a fairly simple img src replace. If anyone here can help: http://pastebin.com/TTuHPD0U
[06:43:26] <NodeX> [14:42:19] <NodeX> I used to use it, not for a while though
[06:43:31] <MacroMan> I get the error 'Cannot call method 'get' of undefined'
[06:44:05] <MacroMan> NodeX: Would you be a able to take a quick peek. SHouldn't be too hard for someone that used to use it?
[06:45:48] <NodeX> what is "Event" in the first bind?
[06:46:32] <MacroMan> I just got that from the docs at http://prototypejs.org/api/event/element
[06:48:05] <NodeX> I think you're better off using $("your-element").observe(...);
[06:48:21] <MacroMan> OK I'll try that thanks
[06:48:45] <NodeX> http://prototypejs.org/api/element/observe
[06:48:52] <NodeX> like that example
[06:49:00] <kai> so, if I've got a draggable, and want to make sure that in the helper, I can do some extra work on top of what a simple clone does, how do I find out what my original draggable was?
[06:50:08] <beefz0r> is it possible to set a cookie forever ?
[06:50:26] <NodeX> upto 2037 on 32bit
[06:50:48] <MacroMan> NodeX: Using $('.thumb').observe('click', function(event){ gives me the cannot call method error again.
[06:50:59] <MacroMan> I think I've almost given up.
[06:51:01] <NodeX> I dont know then
[06:51:30] <MacroMan> NodeX: Thanks for trying anyway. I'll have to find someother solution.
[06:51:38] <NodeX> ask in the group
[06:51:42] <NodeX> that used to be active
[06:51:45] <NodeX> *google group*

[06:56:16] <seutje> do you enjoy escaping like that?
[06:56:26] <sicp> I do not
[06:56:28] <seutje> wouldn't it be easier to use single quotes for the outer ones
[06:56:34] <sicp> sure
[06:56:43] <sicp> before starting with the word img you mean?
[06:56:45] <sicp> the first img
[06:56:50] <seutje> ('<img src="' + img + '" alt="" />') ?
[06:56:53] <beefz0r> I always forget how this is called : var1 ? var2 ...

[07:05:26] <Helbom> any idea what might be causing this?

[07:06:05] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: how?
[07:07:07] <NodeX> that's down to your app ShawnRisk
[07:08:17] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: this is the same code as before, but if you don't want to figure this out that is okay I can try to do this.
[07:10:27] <Helbom> the same happens if i add option[name=X] and use .attr('selected', 'selected').. X is an id
[07:10:44] <Helbom> sorry... option[value=X]
[07:13:17] <Kingsy> does anyone know why var colMain = jQuery(a).find('.col-main'); would save all of the html into colMain apart from <script> elements? they seem to be left out.
[07:14:19] <NodeX> ShawnRisk : it's not my job to figure out, it's down to your app and is outside the scope of this channel
[07:14:31] <ShawnRisk> NodeX: okay I get it, thanks
[07:15:21] <Palmerio>  with "javascriptmvc" the created js code can easily be grabed? in source code
[07:17:10] <angrywombat> anyone know why a call to parent() on an input (text) would skip over a p tag and go to div?
[07:17:29] <angrywombat> i can get around it by making the p tag a div instead, i am just curious cause i don't know much about the dom
[07:20:34] <jdeuce> angrywombat: http://jsfiddle.net/7McR5/ nope?
[07:21:08] <angrywombat> jdeuce: here's my pastebin before i switched to divs: http://pastebin.com/uME1QyEY
[07:21:34] <angrywombat> someone in another channel is saying it's the h3 tag sibling.. firefox thinks it's invalid for some reason and skipping to the nearest div
[07:21:42] <angrywombat> haven't tested that theory yet tho
[07:22:00] <angrywombat> i also tried t.closest('p') but i'm not getting anything from that
[07:22:33] <floogy> Can I use jquery with really less knowledge of javascript?
[07:23:26] <angrywombat> floogy: if you can wrap your head around closures, i think you're better off "learning" JS via jquery
[07:23:27] <blackspotwiggins> floogy, can, but shouldn't
[07:23:34] <floogy> I want to create a nested div container with an image in there and another div with text info.
[07:23:44] <angrywombat> assuming you dont care that much about front end (like me)
[07:23:49] <blackspotwiggins> learn html first
[07:24:31] <MartijnWork> anyone here able to help me out with a newbie problem? http://jsfiddle.net/Q3RLT/4/ doesn't work (nor does it work with type: "POST")
[07:24:43] <floogy> blackspotwiggins, I hope that's not the point, though I rarly code websites..
[07:25:29] <floogy> I got this working by omitting the doublequotes around the var http://paste.ubuntu.com/1146861/
[07:26:23] <floogy> I now want to create another div inside the div and an img element, also with variables in there like
[07:26:34] <floogy> document.write (  "<div id=img_box><img id='img_" + $.myVars.AMB + "' src='../rooms/" + $.myVars.AMB + "/" + $.myVars.DC + "_" + $.myVars.AMB + ".jpg'' alt='" + $.myVars.AMB + "' width='" + $.myVars.width + "' height='" + $.myVars.height + "'  \/><\/div>");
[07:26:50] <jdeuce> angrywombat: yeah p tags can only contain inline elements IIRC so the browser is invalidating your p and putting everything in the div
[07:27:02] <floogy> to avoid the use of document.write
[07:27:15] <jdeuce> angrywombat: if i inspect the DOM tree via chrome developer tools, you can see the p's are actaully empty
[07:29:09] <blackspotwiggins> floogy, then wtf are doing with jquery if you dont do websites?
[07:29:11] <floogy> can anyone point me to the right documentation for novices?
[07:29:59] <beefz0r> erm, what is wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/afExC/1/
[07:30:30] <floogy> blackspotwiggins, I do now for a particular project, to offer images to a customer in a somewhat neat cdrom apllication that works in a browser...
[07:30:32] <Helbom> is there anything else I have to do to display the selected option in my dropdown? besides .attr('selected', 'selected')
[07:30:35] <angrywombat> jdeuce: i got it working by using console.log(t.parent()); instead of console.log(t.parent().id);
[07:30:48] <angrywombat> still kind of unsure how to get the ID but i'm on the right track now
[07:31:01] <faraway> beefz0r: you have choosen Mootools instead of jquery ;)
[07:31:13] <beefz0r> ooooh I see, I always forget that haha
[07:31:37] <beefz0r> jquery should be first in the list IMO, most used
[07:34:14] <stewbydoo> hello
[07:34:28] <jdeuce> angrywombat: t.parent().attr("id") is the preferred way to get the id I believe
[07:34:30] <beefz0r> well this is weird, my code adds this : onchange='html' but when I take a look at it it's onchange="html'
[07:34:59] <ruby_on_tails> how to i detect form reset event ?
[07:35:02] <ruby_on_tails> something like onreset
[07:35:24] <Helbom> is there noone who knows? :(
[07:36:00] <faraway> beefz0r: you cannot to it this way
[07:36:06] <stewbydoo> whats up with my code not accepting .buttonset() even though it is linking to the custom jquery ui js file just fine?
[07:36:16] <beefz0r> faraway, how else ?
[07:37:50] <loincloth> hey all
[07:37:55] <stewbydoo> hello
[07:38:00] <loincloth> is there another room for -ui or is this place ok?
[07:38:12] <stewbydoo> idk I have ui questions also
[07:38:16] <loincloth> heh
[07:38:24] <stewbydoo> what are you strugglin with?
[07:38:37] <floogy> I'm asking this here too: How to create an nested  innerHTML element with jQuery like <div><div><p>text</p></div><div><p><img></p></div></div>?
[07:38:43] <loincloth> i'm just trying to reproduce a simple datepicker() demo.. it doesn't work but i don't have errors.. it might just be css but i can't tell
[07:38:50] <loincloth> thought maybe there would be some gotchas people think of
[07:38:57] <loincloth> but i'm probably just doing something subtle wrong
[07:39:07] <beefz0r> is that javascript ?
[07:39:12] <loincloth> the datepicker div gets added to the dom, but it doesn't appear on click
[07:39:24] <loincloth> i also don't see its style attribute change on click, as i do in the working demo
[07:39:32] <loincloth> (in inspector)
[07:39:42] <faraway> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/afExC/3/
[07:39:53] <stewbydoo> hmm
[07:40:11] <loincloth> stewbydoo: what are you stuck on
[07:40:27] <andrew9184> is there a preferred method for getting full stretch background images
[07:41:00] <faraway> beefz0r: ah sorry … that doesn't work either :D
[07:41:15] <faraway> beefz0r: ah ok .. cookie plugin is missing
[07:41:59] <beefz0r> how do I add it?
[07:42:10] <angrywombat> jdeuce: perfect, thanks
[07:42:33] <stewbydoo> why am i getting .buttonset() is not a function
[07:42:49] <stewbydoo> it is a function...
[07:43:06] <faraway> beefz0r: with add reasource
[07:43:20] <faraway> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/afExC/4/
[07:43:25] <loincloth> stewbydoo: sounds like you have an unexpected undefined object or similar situation
[07:43:46] <loincloth> where buttonset is not a function on the actual object you have at runtime
[07:43:49] <loincloth> but hard to say for sure
[07:44:08] <stewbydoo> hmm
[07:44:14] <stewbydoo> this is frustrating
[07:44:17] <beefz0r> oh jquery doesn't have cookies by default ?
[07:44:42] <jrockjiggz> Hi, im creating an invite step on my site.. but i feel its very uneffective just fetching contacts from gmail/yahoo.. does anyone have any suggestions?
[07:45:11] <Ring0`> Hey, anyone can help me with that? I'm wondering how can I pass params to this last object (where console.log prints undefined) http://jsfiddle.net/33Bha/
[07:46:34] <faraway> beefz0r: jquery does the basics (dom manipulation, selectors, events and ajax) for the rest you can choose of a huge amount of plugins
[07:46:51] <beefz0r> how do I add a plugin on another page ?
[07:47:08] <beefz0r> sorry I ask so much, lol
[07:47:14] <faraway> beefz0r: loading it with the script tag ?¿
[07:51:20] <faraway> beefz0r: don't use cookies to much cause they are send with every request
[07:51:38] <beefz0r> what should I use then to save the state of the checkboxes ?
[07:52:30] <faraway> beefz0r: that depends on what you want to do ;)
[07:52:58] <beefz0r> well, trying to save the state of the checkboxes(and the variables)
[07:53:05] <beefz0r> this code is going in a userscript by the way
[07:53:49] <sicp> I want to append the image to the #left_col if i is even, else append it to #right_col, is this correct? http://pastebin.com/6NLCJCwf
[07:53:49] <faraway> beefz0r: for user scripts (browser plugins i guess) i would use the browser api for saving data
[07:54:33] <faraway> beefz0r:i think cookies won't work like expected for this case
[07:55:31] <beefz0r> erm, userscripts are not browser plugins, are they?
[07:55:56] <beefz0r> firefox = greasemonkey
[07:56:21] <faraway> beefz0r: then user geasemonkey api for saving data, i guess they have something for prefs
[07:56:42] <beefz0r> what should I use in chrome then ? Chrome doesn't use greasemonkey
[07:57:23] <faraway> beefz0r: you can write a chrome extension
[07:58:01] <faraway> beefz0r: http://chromeextensionsdocs.appspot.com/getstarted.html
[07:58:49] <faraway> beefz0r: i think you should be able to reuse most of the code
[08:00:44] <sicp> any idea?
[08:01:18] <sicp> i is not iterating, I get the first image on the left column and all the rest on the right column, I just don't understand where I can escape the loop and not have it read i as 0 again everytime
[08:01:45] <faraway> sicp: i % 2
[08:01:49] <sicp> oh shit
[08:01:57] <sicp> sorry for wasting your time
[08:02:29] <faraway> sicp: was just a sec of my time ;)
[08:03:27] <faraway> sicp: beefz0r is the time thief of the day :P
[08:03:35] <sicp> haha
[08:03:41] <sicp> yea I've watched him since the morning actually
[08:03:55] <beefz0r> faraway, sorry haha
[08:12:13] <sicp> by the way, faraway, that same file is supposed to...well, do what you see it doing, but it only does it for the very first image
[08:12:42] <sicp> I mean well, only for the first image it sets the src, the rest it doesn't set the src for them but it *does* set the altext (which is fetched from XML)
[08:13:21] <sicp> *facepalm* nevermind

[08:37:21] <Kit-10> I'm having a problem with requesting HTML on a server via ajax. http://pastebin.com/cfgHcA6M  the returnedHtml argument is always "undefined" on IE9
[08:37:40] <Kit-10> can anyone help shed some light?
[08:37:53] <loincloth> does anyone know if there are any plans for an AMD compatible or similar version of jquery-ui ?
[08:38:16] <loincloth> i recently wrote a script to take the dev build and wrap it.. pretty easy but curious if that work is planned to be obsolete anytime soon :)
[08:44:28] <faraway> loincloth: thought jquery 1.8 is
[08:44:36] <Kit-10> I'm having a problem with requesting HTML on a server via ajax. http://pastebin.com/cfgHcA6M  the returnedHtml argument is always "undefined" on IE9 ??
[08:44:49] <Kit-10> really weird issue
[08:46:44] <faraway> Kit-10: it it works i other browsers i would guess that the html i probably not well formed
[08:46:50] <faraway> Kit-10: but thats just a guess
[08:47:16] <Kit-10> faraway: hmmm
[08:47:20] <faraway> Kit-10: you return it as content type text ?
[08:48:17] <beefz0r> I think this is the last thing I hafto ask till it's finished : http://jsfiddle.net/Cvtby/ I get "$ is not defined"
[08:49:03] <loincloth> faraway: -ui is?
[08:49:29] <Kit-10> faraway:   http://pastebin.com/wumH9pbA  that's the response.  Looking in IE dev tools, i capture the request. That's what's in the response
[08:51:27] <loincloth> faraway: i was thinking something like this https://github.com/jrburke/jqueryui-amd although i went and wrote a processing setup in ruby instead of node js but whatevs
[08:51:39] <Kit-10> this is what's bugging me is that the same code (php & js) works in IE9 on a diff server
[08:51:54] <loincloth> minimal wrapping is hardly any work at all.. but the processing is kinda janky since it relies on processing the code comments for dependencies
[08:51:59] <Kit-10> checked the headers and they're practically the same (cookie differtences)
[08:52:06] <faraway> loincloth: oh sorry my fault i thought it was
[08:52:22] <loincloth> no worries
[08:54:10] <faraway> Kit-10: you should try to just return somethign like "test" for debugging to see if it is a general problem or if IE has problem with the html code in the response
[08:54:47] <Kit-10> tried but will try again
[08:55:01] <Kit-10> beefz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/Cvtby/2/
[08:56:30] <beefz0r> Kit-10, now I get "jquery is not defined"
[08:56:52] <faraway> beefz0r: in jsfiddle ? well then choose jquery as framework again ;)
[08:57:09] <beefz0r> no not in jsfiddle, lol
[08:57:25] <beefz0r> It's a userscript by the way, and jquery is loaded in the page
[08:57:55] <faraway> beefz0r: then it is not loaded at the time where you try to use it
[08:58:08] <beefz0r> maybe I should wait till the page is loaded ?
[08:59:07] <faraway> beefz0r: sorry don't know about the loading order in greasemonkey
[08:59:39] <faraway> beefz0r: but it is worth to try
[08:59:59] <faraway> beefz0r: even if it is not the best solution you would know that this was the problem
[09:09:48] <codepython777> what is the server supposed to return to a $.post() so that the error() function is called?
[09:11:39] <jlembeck> codepython777: If the server responds with an error code (400s and 500s), it will hit the error callback
[09:12:34] <that_guy_89> Hey guys I have a question.
[09:14:09] <that_guy_89> If I have a self calling anonymous function that passes jQuery to the $ like this (function($){ /*code */ })(jQuery);
[09:14:29] <that_guy_89> Is it really necessary to have a Document.ready function within that?
[09:14:37] <MistuhKurtz> depends that_guy_89
[09:14:40] <MistuhKurtz> are you writing a plugin?
[09:14:45] <that_guy_89> No
[09:15:02] <MistuhKurtz> should the DOM be ready for your code to execute?
[09:15:06] <MistuhKurtz> do you use selectors?
[09:15:09] <that_guy_89> I haven't had any problems yet, but is it possible I will runs into trouble in the future?
[09:15:19] <MistuhKurtz> what's the purpose of the IIFE?
[09:15:21] <shoky> that has nothing to do with $(document).ready ..
[09:15:33] <codepython777> jlembeck: how can i pass an object from the server in that case?
[09:15:45] <konr_trab> How can I figure out what to do with an object? Is there anything to do besides clicking on it at the console? There is no equivalent of .class(), right?
[09:15:47] <that_guy_89> I believe the DOM has to be ready. I use selectors all the time.
[09:15:54] <MistuhKurtz> then yeah, you should use it
[09:15:59] <MistuhKurtz> what is the purpose of your IIFE?
[09:16:09] <MistuhKurtz> why do you need to introduce a new scope? is it necessary?
[09:16:21] <jlembeck> codepython777: if your server returns something when it returns errors, it should be easy enough to handle.
[09:16:23] <that_guy_89> Probably not
[09:16:35] <that_guy_89> Are you suggesting i replace it with a document.ready function?
[09:16:49] <MistuhKurtz> I mean there are totally valid reasons to use that, but it sounds to me like you should replace it with doc.ready
[09:16:50] <codepython777> jlembeck: can error() functions take arguments? Can I send an error object to the client that gets to the error() function?
[09:18:00] <that_guy_89> Does doc.ready create it's own namespace as an IIFE?
[09:18:10] <shoky> that_guy_89: having that IIFE has nothing to do with waiting for the DOM tree to be ready
[09:18:38] <MistuhKurtz> that_guy_89, any function introduces a new scope
[09:18:54] <that_guy_89> Doh, you're right.
[09:18:57] <MistuhKurtz> :)
[09:19:15] <that_guy_89> Well thanks for your answers :)
[09:19:27] <MistuhKurtz> that's why you can do jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ... }); to avoid conflicts with the $ var in the global namespace
[09:19:32] <MistuhKurtz> np
[09:19:38] <shoky> konr_trab: you figure out what to do with it by figuring out what you _want_ to do with it
[09:20:14] <jlembeck> codepython777: yes. it comes in like other callbacks from .ajax, as an argument, just put error( data ) and log what data is.
[09:21:36] <ryanneufeld> jlembeck: you mean .fail(function(data){ }); ?
[09:22:06] <shoky> codepython777: i don't think you can send data to the client in an error response, and get that data in the error/fail callback
[09:22:32] <jlembeck> ryanneufeld: yeah. Also, hey!
[09:22:44] <ryanneufeld> jlembeck: hey man, how's it going?
[09:24:44] <codepython777> shoky: I want to get the exception object in the error callback so that i can display a div to the user.
[09:24:56] <codepython777> jlembeck: thanks.
[09:25:07] <shoky> codepython777: i don't think that's possible using an HTTP error response
[09:26:15] <woozly> guys, how to make smooth div resize animation? when It gets new content
[09:26:47] <MistuhKurtz> woozly, animate in the new content
[09:26:54] <shoky> codepython777: actually maybe you can get the xhr's responseText property, try that..
[09:26:57] <MistuhKurtz> with like slideDown();
[09:27:17] <jlembeck> ryanneufeld: doing great, yourself?
[09:27:21] <shoky> codepython777: e.g.  .fail(function(xhr,status,error) { console.log(xhr.responseText) })
[09:27:30] <ryanneufeld> jlembeck: same old same old.
[09:36:14] <codepython777> shoky: you meant error:function(xhr, status, error){ console.log(xhr.responseText) }
[09:36:24] <shoky> codepython777: it's the same thing
[09:36:42] <codepython777> nah, it should be: error:function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError){ xhr.responseText, xhr.status?
[09:36:47] <shoky> codepython777:  $.ajax(...).fail(function(xhr,status,error) { ... } )  is find too
[09:36:56] <shoky> what?
[09:37:21] <codepython777> shoky: so the server sends a responseText and responseStatus in this case?
[09:37:31] <codepython777> shoky: I was looking at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377644/jquery-ajax-error-handling-show-custom-exception-messages
[09:37:34] <shoky> think so..
[09:37:50] <shoky> yeah they say the same thing
[09:38:04] <shoky> use the xhr.responseText if you want the .. response text ;P
[09:38:14] <codepython777> what is sent from the server in this case? a response object with a != 200 status code?
[09:38:19] <jlembeck> codepython777: shoky: when the server has an error, as long as it's set up correctly, it will send a response status (the error code) along with response text
[09:39:10] <jlembeck> 300 response codes (redirects) are fine as well
[09:39:28] <shoky> codepython777: if the server responds with an error http code and attaches some response, then it'll fire the error/fail handler and you can access the response text with xhr.responseText
[09:39:29] <codepython777> What I'm trying to figure out is what should make_response do (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#flask.Flask.make_response)
[09:39:33] <shoky> not sure what you're asking besides that.
[09:40:01] * shoky shrugs
[09:40:01] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:41:42] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Is .click the most appropriate for when a button is pressed?
[09:42:06] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: what could be more appropriate
[09:42:24] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: Why I'm asking. I assume there isn't?
[09:42:27] <MistuhKurtz> what if the button is selected with tab and then enter is pressed? does click fire when that happens?
[09:42:39] <shoky> yes, actually ;P
[09:42:45] <MistuhKurtz> thought so
[09:43:13] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: .click should be fine yah
[09:43:15] <MistuhKurtz> deltaHeavy, if it's part of a form then submit might be better suited
[09:44:47] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Ok, thanks guys!
[09:46:04] <phuff> Anybody ever had mobile safari stop sending events to jquery?
[09:46:20] <phuff> dispatch() isn't even being called (things work fine on chrome on iPad)
[09:48:29] <pace_t_zulu> anyone know a projected release date for jQuery UI 1.9 ?
[09:48:37] <pace_t_zulu> or where i could find info regarding that
[09:56:02] <erickrdch> hey :)
[09:56:28] <erickrdch> this is my first time asking here, so please excuse me if it is not the right place to do so...
[09:56:53] <erickrdch> i am testing 1.8 on my project and for some reason it is stripping the hash on the url
[09:57:06] <erickrdch> when I switch back to 1.7.2 the site works normally
[09:57:16] <jedimind> url ?
[09:57:27] <erickrdch> it is internal, behind VPN
[09:57:43] <erickrdch> the urls usually look like... /dashboard/#stream
[09:57:53] <erickrdch> or /dashboard/#sites
[09:59:00] <erickrdch> I am trying to set some breakpoints but the redirect happens way fast...
[09:59:45] <erickrdch> I placed a breakpoint on an unminified jquery 1.8 on first lines and, at least when it comes inside it the hash is still there
[10:01:12] <Noeble> I wanna use a click handler with a $(this).childen item. How can I do that? My code.. what I wanna do is on row6. http://pastebin.com/NYZh4feh
[10:03:39] <yezariael> hey all. can anyone help me on how to do this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2206378/how-to-split-a-string-but-also-keep-the-delimiters in jquery or javascript?
[10:04:59] <pandemic> possibly try using regular expressions?
[10:05:58] <yezariael> is there something like the lookahead and lookbehind in javascirpt?
[10:06:40] <pandemic> not sure, but a quick google search returned this http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/mimic-lookbehind-javascript
[10:06:59] <pandemic> so it appears it's not a core feature, but you can mimic it
[10:09:34] <yezariael> this is a good article, but i'm not sure if it will work with the split() method as well. i'll give it a try
[10:12:32] <DrJones> Hi all, quick one. I have a table and want to change all instances of text ZZ in a <tr id='thisone'> for XX. Tried text().replace but did not work
[10:14:09] <DrJones> hmmm corrections it's ZZ in the ids of all elements I want to change...
[10:14:19] <DrJones> that's why text() did not work...
[10:20:27] <fission6> is there any jquery functionality for geolocation
[10:20:37] <mephux> so, I am using jquery 1.8.0 and was using .fadeTo and when i added the jquery-ui js it killed all of this functionality.. is this a know issue
[10:20:47] <mephux> fission6: no, check out session.js
[10:21:29] <mephux> fission6: https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/
[10:22:32] <jedimind> hrm
[10:22:36] <fission6> mephux: interesting, so that just compiles all user client side stuff
[10:22:47] <jedimind> is there a way to build a collection of elements with multiple methods (not just selectors)
[10:22:49] <jedimind> like if i want ...
[10:23:23] <mephux> fission6: well, it just creates a unified dsl for working with html5 geolocation
[10:23:29] <jedimind> $('widget.one-col')  and $('widget').data('cols','1') in one collection i can iterate through with .each
[10:23:36] <mephux> fission6: or it can use a third party api
[10:23:37] <erickrdch> so... any idea if 1.8 is removing or changing somehow the url hash?
[10:25:18] <adlwalrus> is there anything wrong with declaring multiple $(document).ready(functions)?
[10:25:27] <adlwalrus> at different points in my page?
[10:25:31] <cohitre> adlwalrus: no
[10:25:33] <jedimind> adlwalrus, no
[10:25:38] <jedimind> NEIN
[10:26:19] <fission6> how is geolocation implemented? like how does it find your location
[10:27:17] <Kit-10> adlwalrus: yes. Only in so far as that $(document).ready(function(){});  is non-preferred. jQuery(function($) { }); = nicer :D
[10:27:21] <jedimind> fission6, aliens.
[10:28:27] <phuff> jedimind: Doens't .add() do what you want?
[10:28:49] <fission6> im serious
[10:28:58] <fission6> also mephux does sessions.js cache the session object
[10:29:27] <jedimind> phuff, yup. looks like it will
[10:29:28] <jedimind> thanks :)
[10:30:36] <phuff> np
[10:30:50] <phuff> fission6: Are you asking how the browser html5 geolocation is implemented?
[10:30:54] <fission6> yes
[10:31:02] <jedimind> hrm is there something that'll let me select x amount of first matched items?
[10:31:09] <jedimind> kind of like eq, but not a specific index
[10:31:15] <jedimind> like if i want the first ... 5 items of the copllection
[10:31:16] <ajpiano> jedimind: :lt or .slie
[10:31:19] <ajpiano> .slice
[10:31:41] <phuff> fission6: I'm pretty sure it's just ip based like most geolocation for browsers is.
[10:31:56] <phuff> fission6: Though if it's on a client that has access to GPS it probably can use that as well.
[10:32:07] <phuff> fission6: So the short answer is: depends on the browser.
[10:33:04] <fission6> yeah interesting
[10:33:07] <fission6> hmmm.
[10:33:17] <fission6> also i woner if session.js caches what i can
[10:33:18] <jedimind> ty
[10:33:54] <jedimind> im writing a conditional grid system from scratch and its making me want to shoot myself
[10:33:59] <jedimind> there are 1800+ permitations
[10:34:19] <jedimind> which im obviously trying to narrow down to a dozen or less key rules
[10:36:32] <viki_> anyone knows how event handling works on jquery objects that are not present in dom yet. for example, $("<button></button>").click(function (e) {console.log("clicked");})
[10:37:21] <viki_> when I inspected the event object, it doesn't seem to be delegated on an object that is present in the dom
[10:38:36] <clarkfischer> How do you click on an object that isn't in the dom?
[10:39:29] <viki_> by simulating the click
[10:39:29] <pifantastic> ?on @ viki_
[10:39:29] <pifantastic> hmm, no bot
[10:39:39] <pifantastic> oh wait
[10:39:45] <pifantastic> I misunderstood what you were asking
[10:40:07] <pifantastic> viki_: I think jQuery creates a documentFragment
[10:40:36] <viki_> pifantastic : and these event handles get attached to that documentFragment?
[10:40:42] <pifantastic> right
[10:41:13] <LouisLazaris> Does anyone know why on('input') works (on a textarea for example), even though 'input' is not listed as an event in jQuery's documentation? Example: http://jsbin.com/afugek/1/edit Does jQuery accept generic events that are part of JavaScript natively? Is there documenation on that?
[10:41:32] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/VEJBm/2/
[10:41:57] <viki_> ah ok. so when I copy these contents to the dom, the event handlers are still attached to the same elements
[10:42:22] <viki_> and the documentFragment can be set to null, without affecting the event handlers, right?
[10:43:44] <pifantastic> viki_: I believe so, yes
[10:43:58] <viki_> thanks pifantastic
[10:47:52] <jedimind> i could use some help working through some of the logic associated with this grid structure im trying to do
[10:48:16] <jedimind> when i have anumber of floated elements, could anyone figure out a consistent method in figuring out if the :last-child is all by itself on a line
[10:48:47] <gf3> jedimind: With JS or just CSS?
[10:49:02] <jedimind> either or i suppose
[10:49:21] <gf3> jedimind: Well if the left offset from the parent is 0 it is the only element on the line
[10:49:27] <gf3> (the last element that is)
[10:49:35] <jedimind> duh
[10:49:49] <jedimind> fuck, i hate being so deep in something you overlook stupidly simple things
[10:50:26] <jedimind> gf3, thanks
[10:50:29] <jedimind> ps, when are you moving ?
[10:50:34] <gf3> np
[10:50:48] <gf3> jedimind: 31st is my flight
[10:50:50] <gf3> :D
[10:51:09] <jedimind> gf3,  you having a going away party?
[10:52:26] <gf3> jedimind: Nuh, just hanging out with friends at every opportunity
[10:56:01] <alisson> hello! I have an image list, I want load the next image when the previous ends his load. How can I do this wih JQuery?
[10:56:37] <alisson> I'm loading the first image with $('#img').attr('src', 'http://www.google.com.br/myimage.png');
[10:59:54] <MistuhKurtz> alisson, you can use each() to iterate over an array of images
[11:01:11] <BillCriswell> Does anyone know if there's a way to get infinite-scoll to always use the nextSelector instead of only looking at it once and then trying to figure out what the third pages URL might be?
[11:02:32] <alisson> MistuhKurtz: yes, but how can I ensure the second image is loaded when the previous end his own load?
[11:02:46] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[11:02:48] <zapsoda> ?
[11:03:00] <gf3> CSS?
[11:03:22] <MistuhKurtz> alisson, do this
[11:03:23] <alisson> zapsoda: http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[11:03:38] <gf3> HNNGGHHHH
[11:03:41] <gf3> JUST USE CSS
[11:03:41] <MistuhKurtz> $('<img />').load(function(){ return true; }).attr('src', mysource);
[11:03:45] <zapsoda> ok ill try
[11:04:00] <MistuhKurtz> the return true; will 'continue' your loop
[11:04:23] <MistuhKurtz> defining the event handler prior to setting the source eliminates any caching problems from preventing the load event from firing
[11:06:58] <alisson> MistuhKurtz: inside a eachblock?
[11:07:03] <alisson> *an
[11:07:04] <MistuhKurtz> yep
[11:07:21] <stewbydoo> dsfs
[11:09:44] <codetroll> good evening. I am completely new to jQuery so I hope someone can help me with a little guidance ;)
[11:09:54] <eip56> Question: Do I have to camel case all animation properties as well as not short hands?
[11:10:10] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: yt?
[11:10:22] <LindsayMac> yt?
[11:10:26] <ryanneufeld> you there?
[11:10:26] <LindsayMac> im here
[11:10:37] <ryanneufeld> got a min to help me with wordpress?
[11:11:02] <codetroll> I have a dropdown list with names (value= userid)... When I click a button the selected user is added to another table in the database. So far so good. I have made the javascript to add the user to the database and then remove the user from the dropdown list..
[11:11:16] <LindsayMac> sure!
[11:11:24] <ryanneufeld> k. pm
[11:11:29] <ryanneufeld> as it's not jquery related
[11:12:07] <codetroll> No I want to add the newly added user to a list of users in a div above that dropdown list.. each user should have a button to delete it and add it back into the drop down list to be selected.. how can this be done?
[11:12:13] <codetroll> and am I making sense at all?
[11:15:50] <NoiseEee> codetroll: what suggestions come to mind?
[11:16:26] <zapsoda> alisson, aby ideas why its not working? http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ tell me what code to put in pastbin if you need any
[11:16:44] <codetroll> Well - I have been searching for adding anchor tags to a div - but for some reason I get the opposite results.. how to apply divs to anchor tags ;)
[11:17:13] <NoiseEee> codetroll: searching aside.  think in terms of the DOM - how does it need to be adjusted to do what you want to do?
[11:17:30] <codetroll> I am thinking that in my jquery code that adds the user to the table I should have enough information to create the anchor tag i want..
[11:17:47] <codetroll> I want to add elements to another element?
[11:18:33] <NoiseEee> right, you want to create new elements and add them to you <div>.  it should seem straightforward enough: you need an element to hold the persons name, and button elements.
[11:20:11] <zapsoda> any ideas why its not working? http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ tell me what code to put in pastbin if you need any
[11:20:29] <codetroll> so.. I create the div first...  and hide it.. Then when the first person gets added I display the div... and add the anchor..
[11:20:29] <alisson> zapsoda: Remove the div with "scrollbar disable" class
[11:20:53] <NoiseEee> codetroll: by 'anchor' what do you mean, <a> tag?
[11:20:57] <codetroll> is there a way for me to check if the div is currently visible
[11:21:14] <codetroll> yes - well - actually I might not need the anchor..
[11:21:37] <codetroll> it will probably be a form since I will use buttons for removal of the users
[11:21:55] <zapsoda> alisson, which has disable class?
[11:22:14] <codetroll> and it is actually not users - but actors and stuff that needs to be connected/disconnected to/from a movie.. .
[11:22:24] <NoiseEee> codetroll: http://api.jquery.com/is/ and http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[11:22:35] <codetroll> omw....
[11:22:37] <zapsoda> i see it
[11:22:42] <zapsoda> but i didnt put it there
[11:22:48] <zapsoda> so idkhow to remove it
[11:23:44] <NoiseEee> codetroll: so maybe a <ul> (list) and each actor could be a <li>,  as in <li data-userid='422'><span>Eddie Murphy</span> <button class='removeMe'>Remove</button></li>
[11:23:59] <codetroll> yes... that is a good idea..
[11:24:21] <NoiseEee> codetroll: your <ul> would have a listener on it, and when a button with the class 'remove' is clicked, it will find out the user's ID and add them back to your list, and remove its parent <li>
[11:24:27] <NoiseEee> codetroll: your mission is to make it happen
[11:24:40] <codetroll> stupid (perhaps) question - do I need a form tag when I have the buttons?
[11:24:45] <codetroll> hehe lol
[11:25:04] <NoiseEee> codetroll: not necessarily, and you would actually want to add "type='button'" to the buttons so they don't submit anything.
[11:25:30] <codetroll> great... thanks
[11:25:38] <klawd_prime> hi! i'm trying to get QUnit to run but my page stays empty
[11:26:03] <klawd_prime> any idea as to why?
[11:26:05] <zapsoda> alisson, do you know any other scrollbars? that would work for what i need? also i need it to keep working if the div resizes
[11:26:43] <klawd_prime> the tests are just not run it seems #qunit
[11:26:46] <klawd_prime> please help
[11:26:54] <codetroll> Thanks NoiseEee I will have a bash at it.
[11:27:12] <codetroll> (and hope not to be back in 5 minutes because I don't get it ;))
[11:27:25] <NoiseEee> codetroll: good luck!
[11:27:41] <codetroll> thank you!
[11:28:36] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[11:28:40] <klawd_prime> http://46.5.242.92/asd.html <- please help. what am i doing wrong?
[11:28:57] <alisson> zapsoda: in this case, overflow auto at css can works for you
[11:29:13] <alisson> MistuhKurtz: Why the delay do not worked here? http://jsbin.com/welcome/12148/edit
[11:29:39] <MistuhKurtz> delay doesn't work like you think it does
[11:29:47] <MistuhKurtz> you need to use setTimeout
[11:29:58] <MistuhKurtz> also, why the need for a timeout/delay at all?
[11:31:21] <zapsoda> alisson, what are you saying i should set it to overflow auto? which div? im obvousily a noob :)
[11:31:24] <alisson> zapsoda: you have an unecessary div with height: 35220px;, remove it. I think this is you want, correct?
[11:31:29] <MistuhKurtz> also, having the image tags will load them automatically
[11:31:37] <MistuhKurtz> you need to have the image srcs in a js array
[11:31:39] <klawd_prime> http://46.5.242.92/asd.html <- please help. tests are not run. what am i doing wrong?
[11:31:51] <MistuhKurtz> or you can grab them from link href attrs
[11:34:12] <illoomn8> http://codepad.org/7A0mTPCi could someone please help me with this? I've ensured that the url returns json_encode('true') and that the url is being hit by the ajax call, but nothing is triggering the success event
[11:34:29] <alisson> MistuhKurtz: The delay is to see the images loading at sequence, they load so fast and I don't know if is really working... But it's unecessary.... that will ensure the next image will load only when the previous is complete?
[11:34:49] <zapsoda> alisson, whats the name of the div with the height of 35220?
[11:35:05] <MistuhKurtz> yes the load event will ensure they load sequentially
[11:35:11] <MistuhKurtz> but since you have <img /> tags they're loading immediately
[11:35:20] <alisson> zapsoda: What browser re you using?
[11:35:27] <zapsoda> Chrome
[11:35:30] <rgr> Hi folks, Im on a very low bandwidth here (phone tethered) and cant really google much worth it : I am using the jquery dialog(). How can I get it to auto resize when I hide one child element and display another viy jquery triggers? Possible even?
[11:35:36] <zapsoda> and i know how to go into the inspector
[11:35:46] <zapsoda> but i dont see the one with 35220
[11:35:57] <dogarrhea2> need to debug a different iframe/domain in chrome, how do you do this?
[11:35:58] <alisson> zapsoda: With your website opened, press F12 at your keyboard
[11:36:29] <zapsoda> ok that open the inspector
[11:37:02] <illoomn8> what conditions is the following looking for to evaluate as "success"? http://codepad.org/7A0mTPCi
[11:37:05] <zapsoda> still dont see  height: 35220px; tho
[11:37:11] <zapsoda> or anything near
[11:38:05] <jdeuce> illoomn8: the solution is to initialize with "resize": "auto" and use jqueryui > 1.8 ... http://jsbin.com/ubowa
[11:38:12] <zapsoda> alisson, :( i fail
[11:38:23] <klawd_prime> http://46.5.242.92/asd.html <- please help. why dont my tests start?
[11:38:35] <jdeuce> errr illoomn8 sorry that was meant for rgr... rgr see above ^
[11:38:39] <alisson> zapsoda: Click at zoom icon at inspector bottom and then at white empty space
[11:38:48] <rgr> thanks!
[11:38:55] <illoomn8> lol i was going to say
[11:39:34] <alisson> zapsoda: You can find the div at inspector too, there are a div with the class "scrollbar disable"
[11:41:15] <alisson> MistuhKurtz: I'm loading the img tags because there are a gallery plugin who uses them to cont the images, then I added the ajax load at src. If I remove the image tags the gallery plugin will stop working, then I want put set the src attribute one by one
[11:42:10] <MistuhKurtz> alisson, perhaps you can construct the DOM in js after loading the images, and -then- call the gallery plugin
[11:43:55] <konr_trab> How can I import a file full of templates, defined via '<script type="text/template" id="foobar">...</script>'?
[11:44:23] <zapsoda> alisson, i found it i has height 53000 for me but how do i remove the disable class from that? i didnt put it on the line i have it my code is this
[11:44:24] <zapsoda> <div class="scrollbar"><div class="track"><div class="thumb"><div class="end"></div></div></div></div>
[11:48:29] <klawd_prime> http://46.5.242.92/asd.html <- please help. why dont my tests start?
[11:49:12] <zapsoda> alisson, any ideas?
[11:49:26] <Dev_> anyone know of a good way to auto format html?
[11:49:33] <Dev_> ie. add line breaks and tabs
[11:49:36] <ryanneufeld> tidy
[11:49:40] <johnkpaul> klawd_prime: you need a module()
[11:49:52] <johnkpaul> ?g qunit module @ klawd_prime
[11:49:53] <b-ot> klawd_prime, QUnit/module - jQuery JavaScript Library → http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/module
[11:50:40] <klawd_prime> johnkpaul: added a module, still nothing
[11:51:05] <Dev_> ryanneufeld: is tidy available as a script?
[11:51:16] <ryanneufeld> Dev_: I dunno
[11:51:18] <ryanneufeld> I think so
[11:51:25] <ryanneufeld> it's a command line tool
[11:52:25] <nickelnick|2> heya ll
[11:52:29] <klawd_prime> http://46.5.242.92/asd.html <- please help. why dont my tests start?
[11:53:10] <johnkpaul> klawd_prime: your tests start fine for me
[11:53:35] <klawd_prime> johnkpaul: they run now. i copied over qunit.js again
[11:53:38] <klawd_prime> weird stuff
[11:53:42] <rgr> illoomn8: hmm. doesnt seem to shrink back unfortunately. jquery-ui at 1.8.22
[11:54:11] <nickelnick|2> if someone can have a look at why this simple selector with "this" does not work? that'd be awesome. http://pastie.org/4475366
[11:54:14] <zapsoda> Dev_, http://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html
[11:54:43] <nickelnick|2> i have console.log this and it even gives me the right tr
[11:55:07] <rgr> hmm theres no resize in the document. Only resizeable.
[11:55:17] <zapsoda> ;;seen alisson
[11:55:28] <Dev_> zapsoda: that looks great but can i include it in my own page?
[11:55:55] <zapsoda> idk
[11:56:27] <rgr> a resize event for when you resize it. But how to tell an element to resize to the minumum to show the visible elements?
[11:56:42] <Dev_> yeah, i need something that will allow me to do just that on my own site
[11:56:55] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[11:56:57] <Dev_> i have lots of crappy html that needs to go into an wysiwyg edotr
[11:56:58] <masak> rgr: calculate their total size, and resize to that?
[11:57:20] <zapsoda> Dev_, couldnt you just paste your code into there then copy it back
[11:57:27] <rgr> seems rather long winded. Nothing built in? Its an editor that shows different elements depending on a radio box set.
[11:57:43] <Dev_> i could, but i need the actual functionality
[11:58:03] <Dev_> maybe php is a better option
[11:59:40] <masak> rgr: well, the layout engine of browsers essentially do what you want, but I don't know that it's callable from userland...
[12:00:18] <rgr> annoying
[12:01:34] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[12:09:23] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[12:11:19] <upstream> I have a large unordered list that I want to filter, is it better (performance wise) to destroy the ul and rebuild it from my filtered (smaller) array or to simply `hide` the li items that I don't want to see?
[12:22:12] <SkiOne> anyone here can tell me how to set the default number of rows displayed in the tablesorter plugin?
[12:22:39] <jimi_> This is giving me an unterminated string literal, can anyone spot it? http://codepad.org/TicPPrMP
[12:25:02] <hmbg> jimi_: you can't just have line breaks in the middle of a string in javascript
[12:26:07] <hmbg> you have to go ' yadayada ' + 'stuff on next row ' ...
[12:27:38] <jimi_> hmbg, ah, i was doing a serialize pretty on it
[12:29:08] <beefz0r> I don't get what's wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/zUfzG/
[12:30:50] <jedimind> gf3, how do you get offset from the parent specifially? .offset() is just in document is it not ?
[12:30:52] <abletony84> At my multistep slide-to-the-left form at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/4EPE4/6/ - how do I make it so that radios, when clicked, will trigger the next step? (in addition to the input submits)
[12:30:52] <jedimind> or am i making shit up
[12:30:56] <abletony84> Just trying to spare the user that extra click..
[12:31:10] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[12:31:28] <gf3> jedimind: $.fn.position
[12:31:29] <NoiseEee> beefz0r: forgot the dot between 'script' and 'addEventListener'
[12:32:04] <jedimind> how is $('el:last-child') returning 2 things wtf
[12:32:28] <lathan> jedimind, if there are 2 el 's
[12:32:36] <lathan> jedimind, each el can have a last-child
[12:32:53] <jedimind> its just a UL > LI structure, there's a definitive last LI in there
[12:32:54] <beefz0r> thank you very, very much NoiseEee
[12:33:06] <jedimind> $('ul#single > li:last-child')
[12:33:08] <jedimind> should return only one
[12:33:14] <beefz0r> it's been bugging me the entire day
[12:33:24] <NoiseEee> beefz0r: eyes 4 rent anytim
[12:33:25] <NoiseEee> e
[12:33:26] <lathan> jedimind, yep, it should. can you give an example of it not?
[12:33:38] <lathan> a working jsfiddle would be preferrered...
[12:33:50] <DrJones> Somewhat a newbie question: If I have a $('.type_dropdown').change that works, but my cone dynamically adds dropdowns in the same class, why is it that the change event is not triggered on those new dropdown?
[12:34:02] <lathan> ?bot
[12:34:05] <lathan> shame
[12:34:44] <lathan> DrJones, you need to delegate. use on with a selector, or live or delegate (depending on which jQuery version you are on)
[12:35:32] <DrJones> lathan: runnig v1.7.1 right now
[12:35:48] <DrJones> lathan: not too sure what you mean by delegate
[12:35:51] <lathan> DrJones, then you are fine with using the delegation functionality of .on
[12:36:19] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/VEJBm/6/ you can see the console.log is firing twice
[12:36:37] <DrJones> lathan: care to elaborate on delegation?
[12:36:40] <lathan> DrJones: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:36:50] <DrJones> lathan: thanks
[12:37:00] <jedimind> lathan, the .each is near the bottom
[12:37:01] <Somatt> for some reason, fancybox adds overflow:hidden on its wrapper when in chrome, making the close button getting cropped. This doesn't happen in ff. Any clue about that ?
[12:37:04] <jedimind> sorry about the large chunk of code
[12:37:10] <lathan> wow jedimind
[12:37:28] <jedimind> the whole thing is ... me just working through a concept
[12:37:52] <jedimind> its sloppy and useless, i know
[12:37:57] <lathan> jedimind, if you are working on a tough concept, then you should try working on it in a simple example
[12:38:18] <jedimind> this IS the simple concept lol
[12:38:47] <lathan> no jedimind, this is simple: http://jsfiddle.net/L8juA/
[12:39:11] <jedimind> i happened to have this already in a fiddle
[12:39:27] <jedimind> only reason i didnt isolate it
[12:39:29] <zapsoda> Whats the simplest Jquery custom scrollbar? i seem to fail at making most work
[12:39:30] <jedimind> anyway; its all good
[12:39:48] <codepython7771> is there an error in this function : http://jsfiddle.net/nGGXw/1/ ? I get an uncaught syntax error: Unexpected identifier.
[12:42:13] <chilversc> codepython7771: script tags, jsfiddle includes them automatically
[12:42:37] <lathan> jedimind, that console.log only runs once
[12:42:45] <codepython7771> chilversc: its happening in my code -- except for that?
[12:42:46] <lathan> jedimind, you have 2 prior console.log statements above in your code
[12:42:51] <lathan> console.log(tickets);
[12:42:54] <lathan> console.log(attendees);
[12:42:55] <chilversc> codepython7771: or more correctly, jsfiddle places the script content in a separate .js file
[12:43:20] <lathan> jedimind, always lable your console.log lines, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/VEJBm/7/
[12:43:26] <jedimind> lathan, haha yeah i just saw that
[12:43:28] <jedimind> and hung my head in shame
[12:43:29] <jedimind> im sorry
[12:43:41] <lathan> that's what everyone says when they go to say jQuery has a bug....most of the time
[12:43:45] <lathan> jedimind, ^
[12:44:00] <ezakimak> is there a mega-menu plugin that supports themeroller?
[12:44:07] <jedimind> i didnt say jquery had a bug, i know better than that :)
[12:44:54] <chilversc> codepython7771: funton
[12:45:07] <chilversc> codepython7771: * funtion even
[12:45:59] <peterrus> could anyone tell me why in this: http://pastebin.com/X6SiL5wQ the eventbinding won't work
[12:46:18] <peterrus> tree is a third party plugin by the way
[12:46:28] <peterrus> but maybe I am doing something obviously wrong
[12:47:31] <lathan> peterrus, it looks fine...but I have no context, nor do I know what the correct event should be
[12:47:55] <lathan> peterrus, are you sure that the event 'tree.contextmenu' is correct?
[12:48:05] <peterrus> well i am sure about .contexmenu
[12:48:13] <peterrus> lathan, but not about tree
[12:48:17] <peterrus> what does that refer to?
[12:48:19] <peterrus> an object?
[12:48:23] <peterrus> called tree?
[12:48:40] <lathan> before the period is the event type, after the period is a class you can add to filter events
[12:48:48] <lathan> peterrus, you probably want a click or rightclick
[12:48:52] <lathan> with the .contextmenu
[12:49:12] <peterrus> the plugin comes from: http://mbraak.github.com/jqTree/
[12:49:18] <peterrus> and there is stated:
[12:49:19] <lathan> if you do just: .contextmenu, then alert( event.type + ":" + node.name);
[12:49:28] <peterrus> tree.contextmenu
[12:49:28] <peterrus> Triggered when the user right-clicks a tree node. The event contains the following proper
[12:49:42] <peterrus> http://mbraak.github.com/jqTree/#event-tree-contextmenu
[12:49:44] <peterrus> ok let me try
[12:49:58] <lathan> peterrus, yah...looks right
[12:50:09] <lathan> no way to debug it further without a demo / example
[12:50:38] <peterrus> i will slap something up
[12:51:01] <codepython7771> if on windows, which editor do you use to edit jquery/js code?
[12:51:21] <jedimind> gf3, youre so smart
[12:51:26] <jedimind> if you werent so ugly, id kiss you
[12:51:38] <gf3> I'll take it
[12:59:08] <codepython7771> chilversc: indeed that was 1 prblem
[12:59:48] <peterrus> lathan, http://mediavis.nl/tree/
[12:59:48] <codepython7771> chilversc: Now I get UncaughtReferenceError: Eobj not defined ! on the line $(".error-modal-html").append(Eboj.message);
[13:00:02] <peterrus> if you would want to take a look that would be nice :)
[13:00:27] <peterrus> codepython7771, lately people swear by sublime text
[13:00:51] <jimi_> Why is this an illegal character?           jQuery.each(geoJSONObj, function(i, item) {});​
[13:01:07] <chilversc> codepython7771: um, same as before Eboj
[13:01:49] <codepython7771> I need a better editor
[13:01:50] <codepython7771> :)
[13:01:54] <codepython7771> chilversc: Thanks
[13:02:53] <illoomn8> http://codepad.org/ovTJwZOh could someone please tell me why the second definition doesn't work but hte first does?
[13:03:06] <illoomn8> or how to correctly define the function in the success field?
[13:04:00] <Eviltwin> illoomn8: The first doesn't actually work
[13:04:08] <Eviltwin> ?ajax @ illoomn8
[13:04:17] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[13:04:26] <illoomn8> the first does work
[13:04:29] <illoomn8> the second doesn't
[13:04:37] <illoomn8> regardless, why doesn't hte second work?
[13:04:41] <peterrus> illoomn8, you can try to define a new function containing the alert
[13:04:44] <peterrus> and then call that
[13:04:57] <peterrus> instead of using a inline defined one-time-use function
[13:05:15] <illoomn8> how to pass the returned json?
[13:05:22] <loincloth> i jquery-mobile meant to be an eventual replacement for jquery-ui?
[13:05:25] <chilversc> illoomn8: the first one doesn't work either, the alert executes right away and returns void
[13:05:54] <shoky> loincloth: no
[13:05:54] <chilversc> illoomn8: so its the same as writing; alert('success'); $.ajax({..., success: undefined});
[13:05:57] <loincloth> or is jquery-mobile more of a refresh of jquery-ui with mobile/touch in mind from the get?
[13:05:58] <konr_trab> How can I submit a POST request to a page with some json and go there, as if through a regular <form>?
[13:06:15] <illoomn8> chilversc, its only executed on success though, if http response isn't 200 then no alert
[13:06:19] <illoomn8> so it at least somewhat works :p
[13:06:25] <loincloth> shoky: how do you see its place amongst the others?
[13:06:30] <loincloth> just curious for perspective
[13:07:25] <invisib> I'm trying to do an onclick -> play mp3
[13:07:28] <invisib> How to do?
[13:08:38] <shoky> loincloth: i'm not a jqmobile user so i cant give a good answer.. but.. jqmobile (at least parts of it) uses jquery UI
[13:09:10] <loincloth> shoky: ah, word.. thx
[13:09:12] <shoky> loincloth: and the integration between mobile and UI is supposed to be improved in the future
[13:09:16] <jdeuce> konr_trab: have a hidden form that you populate and call .submit() on.
[13:10:34] <codepython7771> chilversc: Question about getJSON: http://jsfiddle.net/Wd9Au/
[13:10:54] <peterrus> can somebody explain me why the rightclick (contextmenu) event does not work when I rightclick a node in the tree?
[13:10:55] <peterrus> http://mediavis.nl/tree/
[13:11:12] <konr_trab> jdeuce: gratias tibi ago!
[13:11:19] <invisib> nm i can do
[13:11:22] <chilversc> codepython7771: just give it a try and find out?
[13:11:33] <chilversc> codepython7771: I don't know of a reason why that wouldn't work
[13:11:33] <illoomn8> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_ajax2  its exactly the same as from the tutorial
[13:11:38] <codepython7771> http://jsfiddle.net/Wd9Au/2/
[13:11:51] <codepython7771> I actually never use var jqxhr.
[13:12:01] <codepython7771> Whats that supposed to be for?
[13:12:09] <Eviltwin> peterrus: Because tree.jquery.js calls preventDefault() on the mousedown event
[13:12:13] <shoky> loincloth: actually donno if mobile uses UI right now
[13:12:17] <Eviltwin> Which means the right click doesn't actually end up happening
[13:12:25] <loincloth> shoky: haha what
[13:12:28] <loincloth> ok
[13:12:41] <peterrus> Eviltwin, strange, so this would be a bug in the plugin?
[13:12:42] <chilversc> codepython7771: for if you want to access and use the xhr object after the request has been made, eg if you want to be able to abort it or something
[13:13:13] <shoky> loincloth: sorry, i answered when i don't really know ;)
[13:13:38] <Eviltwin> peterrus: That's my suspicion
[13:13:52] <peterrus> lets get the latest version from git
[13:14:38] <ezioa> anyone know why adding a <img tag always causes the image to be re downloadeD?
[13:15:24] <jdeuce> ezioa: you can cache <img> nodes locally in your script to override that
[13:15:41] <peterrus> Eviltwin, latest version still has this preventDefault()
[13:15:50] <peterrus> I might just contact the author here
[13:15:55] <shoky> codepython7771: you can do what you asked about in the fiddle. but know that in your 'usually used form' you're only setting a success callback (and not setting any error callback)
[13:15:56] <lathan> peterrus, preventDefault just keeps the browser's action from happening
[13:16:05] <peterrus> ah
[13:16:08] <ezioa> jdeuce, i've asked this question several times and you're the first to answer
[13:16:18] <peterrus> lathan, well that is what is supposed to happen
[13:16:21] <shoky> codepython7771: also the arguments to the error callback are _not_ 'data'
[13:16:23] <ezioa> jdeuce, would i cache the data into a variable?
[13:16:24] <lathan> peterrus, doesn't prevent future handlers to run...that's stopPropogation() or return false
[13:16:34] <tubbo> is there a really easy way to GET a route and return a boolean response based on whether it was 200 OK or not
[13:16:40] <tubbo> s/route/URL
[13:16:47] <lathan> ezioa, var $img = $('<img src="blah.jpg />');
[13:16:50] <peterrus> lathan, I am afraid I am not that expirienced with javascript, this is a 3rd party plugin
[13:16:54] <tubbo> like i want to be able to do var isValid = $.get("/validation_check");
[13:16:54] <Eviltwin> lathan: The contextual menu that appears via right-clicking in the browser is the browser's default action, not an event handler
[13:17:02] <ezioa> lathan, thank you
[13:17:20] <lathan> Eviltwin, but the plugin is most likely trying to stop that and create their own context menu
[13:17:25] <jdeuce> ezioa: yeah, i usually do something like var cache = {}.. then you can have ilke function get_img(src) { if (!cache[src]) cache[src] = $("<img>", {src: src}); return cache[src]; }
[13:17:47] <ezioa> okay
[13:17:49] <Eviltwin> lathan: It's also used to prevent accidental text selection for something that's draggable
[13:17:50] <ezioa> thanks guys
[13:17:55] <Eviltwin> That might be what they were trying to prevent
[13:18:07] <shoky> tubbo: no, ajax is asynchronous, so $.get (or $.ajax) returns immediately, before the request even hits the server..
[13:18:15] <Eviltwin> It's hard to gauge the user's intent that early
[13:18:26] <peterrus> Eviltwin, it is trying to prevent the browsers right click menu from showing
[13:18:31] <peterrus> so I can implement my own contextmenu
[13:18:49] <codepython7771> shoky: I'll fix them -- you meant : error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) ?
[13:18:53] <lathan> Eviltwin, I am quite aware of what preventDefault does and can be used for
[13:18:54] <Eviltwin> Oh it's happening and you're trying to prevent it from happening?
[13:18:57] <tubbo> shoky: is there a paradigm for validating based on a remote response that a lot of people use? this has always been a problem that's stumped me.
[13:18:57] <shoky> codepython7771: ya
[13:19:00] <Eviltwin> I thought it was the other way round
[13:19:24] <codepython7771> and success = success(data, textStatus, jqXHR). Got it, thanks
[13:19:27] <shoky> tubbo: using the ajax callback(s)..
[13:19:27] <peterrus> Eviltwin, the built in browser context menu is showing indeed, but I want an alert top pop up (just to test it)
[13:19:32] <lathan> Eviltwin, its a tree plugin, and on right click, they want to make their own context menu come up with tree operations rather than browser context options
[13:19:43] <peterrus> alert to pop up*
[13:19:50] <peterrus> lathan, correct
[13:19:51] <chilversc> tubbo: go with the async, $.ajax(...).success(function() { ... }).error(function() { ... })
[13:19:52] <Eviltwin> peterrus: Then you actually want to preventdefault on right clicks
[13:20:01] <lathan> Peterman, if the browser context menu is showing...then the plugin is failing
[13:20:18] <peterrus> so I have implemented it correctly
[13:20:20] <lathan> Peterman, try in other browsers.... and make a working demo on jsbin or jsfiddle and show that to the plugin author
[13:20:20] <peterrus> ?
[13:20:27] <peterrus> will do
[13:20:36] <lathan> sorry Peterman, wrong name
[13:20:56] <codepython7771> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Wd9Au/3/ -- better?
[13:21:42] <tubbo> chilversc: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalrighty :)
[13:21:43] <tubbo> :D
[13:21:58] <shoky> codepython7771: yeah as long as you know that one has an error handler and the other doesn't, so the 2 forms you wrote are not identical per-se
[13:22:11] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[13:22:20] <lathan> Hi
[13:22:26] <bnb_dev> I am using jquery ui autocomplete
[13:22:44] <bnb_dev> and I am facing a problem
[13:23:11] <bnb_dev>  The following are the links of code and screenshot.
[13:23:18] <bnb_dev> http://awesomescreenshot.com/037d66je6
[13:23:20] <bnb_dev> http://jsfiddle.net/j3t56/
[13:23:35] <codepython7771> shoky: I did not.
[13:23:39] <lathan> bnb_dev, well, we can't read your mind.....
[13:23:46] <lathan> sorry bnb_dev...lag
[13:23:47] <codepython7771> shoky: I was hoping to implement the functions right where I say {...}?
[13:23:59] <codepython7771> shoky: is that not the case?
[13:24:26] <codepython7771> can you update the fiddle if you mean something else?
[13:24:49] <jedimind> Array.prototype.push = '(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻';
[13:24:58] <shoky> codepython7771: it is, that's fine. i was just pointing out that the previous example in your fiddle ('I usually use this form') doesn't have an error callback
[13:25:02] <jedimind> good times
[13:25:12] <codepython7771> shoky: indeed
[13:25:19] <codepython7771> Thats what i'm trying to introduce
[13:25:26] <shoky> cool
[13:25:32] <bnb_dev> lathan: on fiddle I put the code. the problem is regarding scrollbar with jquery ui 1.8.0
[13:25:34] <chilversc> jedimind: is that to shake out anything that uses foreach incorrectly?
[13:25:56] <shoky> codepython7771: and btw .success and .error are (will be?) deprecated in favor of .done and .fail, to match the deferreds api
[13:26:56] <lathan> bnb_dev...your example is big and I'm not sure what your question is
[13:27:33] <codepython7771> shoky: wow! Thanks. Where is the new manual?
[13:27:46] <codepython7771> Can you point me to .done/fail manual page please
[13:28:13] <Rndnick> hi folks
[13:28:22] <shoky> codepython7771: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/  that has the deprecation notice
[13:28:42] <Parhs> hello dudes.. which is a good gallery that allows big descriptions ?
[13:28:46] <Rndnick> anyone know of a jquery modal that shows both images and plays youtubes, depending what you put in ?
[13:29:02] <Rndnick> i want it to play the youtube inside the box, but if its an image just show the image
[13:29:12] <bnb_dev> my question is,when I click on the button of scroll-bar of the drop down list, and want to scroll. as I click on it the list disappears  in google chrome
[13:29:32] <shoky> codepython7771: .done and .fail are taken from jquery's Deferred objects API. and the ajax implementation uses the deffereds internally
[13:29:32] <codepython7771> shoky: what are the signatures for the .done() and .fail() functions?
[13:29:46] <bnb_dev> that problem is with jquery ui 1.8.0
[13:29:48] <shoky> codepython7771: in the context of ajax requests, exacly the same as .success and .error
[13:29:51] <codepython7771> fail = function(jqXHR, textStatus)
[13:30:05] <lathan> bnb_dev, well, you should set jQuery in the left column
[13:30:15] <codepython7771> lemme tryt hat
[13:31:32] <Rndnick> folks
[13:31:36] <Rndnick> i want it to play the youtube inside the box, but if its an image just show the image
[13:31:40] <Rndnick> anyone know of a jquery modal that shows both images and plays youtubes, depending what you put in ?
[13:31:46] <bnb_dev> but if I use jquery ui 1.8.22 the scroll bar works well but the code in the jquery ui autocomplete  if (!valid) {  not works
[13:32:08] <lathan> not sure bnb_dev, I don't think I can look at it now....
[13:32:32] <bnb_dev> lathan: ok no problem
[13:33:37] <shoky> bnb_dev: you didnt define that 'valid' var anywhere
[13:34:24] <bnb_dev> shoky: see in the change: function(event, ui){
[13:34:50] <shoky> bnb_dev: i see that you use it and put stuff in it, but you didnt define it anywhere. e.g.  var valid;
[13:35:35] <shoky> oops
[13:35:38] <shoky> bnb_dev: sorry :D
[13:35:43] <shoky> bnb_dev: my bad
[13:37:23] <bnb_dev> shoky: sorry I did not understand
[13:37:57] <shoky> bnb_dev: forget what i said, i made a mistake
[13:38:15] <bnb_dev> shoky: no problem
[13:39:36] <bnb_dev> shoky: actually I am expecting the code should work on keypress or keyup , when no matching is found in the drop down
[13:41:11] <peterrus> contextmenu issue reported
[13:41:11] <peterrus> https://github.com/mbraak/jqTree/issues/63
[13:41:56] <abletony84> At my multistep slide-to-the-left form at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/4EPE4/6/ - how do I make it so that radios, when clicked, will trigger the next step? (in addition to the input submits)
[13:42:00] <abletony84> Trying to spare the user that extra click. I've tried changing $('<input type="submit" value="Next">') to $('<input type="submit" value="Next">', '.steppable li') but that didn't do much.
[13:42:11] <codepython7771> I send a list of email addresses in json to my client --> $.getJSON. What do I need to send to make it understand its an empty list? Whats the correct way of doing this?
[13:44:06] <shoky> codepython7771: empty array? []
[13:44:22] <codepython7771> shoky: so the Response should be "[]"?
[13:44:49] <shoky> codepython7771: i suppose..
[13:45:01] <codepython7771> and data.length = 0 for that?
[13:46:48] <shoky> ya..
[13:47:17] <codepython7771> thanks
[13:47:18] <codepython7771> :)
[13:49:38] <zduffy> I have a question. How can I make this hover only once until the page is reloaded again? If you hover "#bookslide" it slides however many times you hover it. http://pastebin.com/xS7pasxH
[13:51:21] <zduffy> Never mind figured it out lol! Had to use unbind. Thanks guys
[13:51:28] <masak> zduffy: unbind the event on hover?
[13:51:32] <NomadJim> can someone explain what this function does? http://dpaste.org/jh3up/
[13:51:33] <masak> oh, you just figgered it out :)
[13:51:36] <zduffy> :)
[13:51:41] <NomadJim> particularly the $(function() part
[13:51:55] <shoky> NomadJim: that's a shortcut for $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[13:51:55] <zduffy> Thanks! haha. I knew I should have thought before I posted
[13:51:58] <NomadJim> i don't grok this code
[13:53:04] <NomadJim> shoky:  ah thanks
[13:54:55] <imsky> shoky u so helpful
[13:55:50] <shoky> im a helpful fool unto myself
[13:57:28] <yen_> hey guys anyone here has some experience in jq and wordpress?
[13:57:58] <yen_> need to help with post pagination (code that splits posts into multiple pages), we want to make it into ajax
[13:58:10] <lahwran> how do I ensure that an element has a particular class?
[13:58:20] <lahwran> I want to add it if missing, and do nothing if it's there
[13:58:28] <lahwran> also, how do I do the reverse - ensure it doesn't
[13:59:04] <NoiseEee> lahwran: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/
[13:59:17] <lahwran> NoiseEee: none of those do what I want
[13:59:28] <NoiseEee> lahwran: combined with some logic, of course they do.
[13:59:30] <lahwran> NoiseEee: and they have different behavior for sets
[14:00:00] <lahwran> I can't do .hasClass and then .addClass, because if one matched element has it but another doesn't, then doesn't work
[14:00:12] <lahwran> wait, maybe .filter()
[14:00:16] <NoiseEee> then iterate
[14:00:29] <tw2113> stop, iterate, and listen?
[14:01:13] <imsky> ice ice baby
[14:01:33] <yen_> tw2113 you are a star helper, or i;m seeing doubles and triples of you in all channels!
[14:01:50] <imsky> tw2113 is a bot
[14:01:50] <tw2113> you're only in 1 channel at a time yen_ ?
[14:02:10] <yen_> i see you in wordpress and jq
[14:02:12] <rgr> I have some jq that searches for an element using something like 'el.parents(".embed:first")' , if not found it then trs 'el.parents(".listevent:first")' - can I combine these two so that it tries for embed first then listevent in the parents search?
[14:02:21] <shoky> lahwran: just addClass or removeClass, you don't have to check beforehand..
[14:02:39] <tw2113> yeah, i'm omnicient
[14:03:09] <tw2113> wait, that just makes me sound like a brainiac
[14:03:09] <tw2113> i'm in like 8 channels across 2 irc networks right now yen_
[14:03:11] <yen_> lol okay tw2113
[14:04:03] <shoky> omnircient :\
[14:04:21] <rgr> or in other words how to search parents for an element of one class else another fallback class?
[14:04:25] <tw2113> erhmergherd shoky
[14:04:40] * shoky smax
[14:05:26] <lahwran> shoky: but that will add the class multiple times
[14:05:30] <lahwran> or only remove it once
[14:05:58] <shoky> lahwran: it'll add it if its' not there. and remove it if it's there
[14:06:54] <abletony84> At my multistep slide-to-the-left form at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/4EPE4/8/ - does anybody know why feature C causes my radio inputs to display in line?
[14:07:08] <abletony84> * feature A, sorry
[14:07:41] <NoiseEee> abletony84: looks like different markup?
[14:07:56] <lahwran> shoky: oh.
[14:08:16] <abletony84> NoiseEee: what do you mean?
[14:08:54] <Eviltwin> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPE4/9/
[14:09:02] <NoiseEee> abletony84: the first fieldstep is <ul><li><label></label></li></ul> <input>   versus the other two which are <ul><li><label></label><input></li>
[14:09:08] <Eviltwin> Because you were selecting existing elements and .appendTo-ing them
[14:09:31] <Eviltwin> Thus moving all of them to the end of the container
[14:10:35] <abletony84> hmmmm
[14:11:27] <rgr> I have some jq that searches for an element using something like 'el.parents(".embed:first")' , if not found it then trs 'el.parents(".listevent:first")' - can I combine these two so that it tries for embed first then listevent in the parents search?
[14:11:42] <abletony84> Eviltwin: thanks but it seems it now moves to the end of the container
[14:12:48] <abletony84> after the first step, skipping the in between steps i mean
[14:12:52] <jedimind> can you removeClass with a wildcard?
[14:12:55] <Eviltwin> rgr: So if it has an ancestor .listevent that's closer than .embed, the .embed should still win?
[14:13:15] <rgr> that wont happen. embed would always be first
[14:13:24] <rgr> if it exists
[14:13:36] <Eviltwin> el.parents(".embed, .listevent").first()
[14:13:38] <Eviltwin> Also see .closest()
[14:13:54] <rgr> so that guarentees embed search first? ok.
[14:14:07] <Eviltwin> No
[14:14:23] <Eviltwin> What it does is go to the parent, sees if it's an .embed OR a .listevent
[14:14:30] <rgr> aha of course
[14:14:31] <Eviltwin> And if so adds it to the list, then up to the next parent
[14:14:45] <Eviltwin> And so on
[14:14:48] <Eviltwin> And takes the first match
[14:15:11] <Eviltwin> .closest doesn't build that whole list. It just searches until it finds the first parent that matches
[14:15:16] <rgr> ok, thatll do for this structure. Should have guessed that. Thanks.
[14:15:16] <rgr>  cuold I also do ".embed:first,.embed:first" ?
[14:15:24] <rgr> swap second embed for listevent there.
[14:16:29] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure If you were to do $(".embed:first, .listevent:first") you have the potential to end up with two elements
[14:16:46] <Eviltwin> I don't know how that works with .closest though
[14:16:55] <Eviltwin> But .first() is always faster than doing :first
[14:16:59] <Eviltwin> So I'm in the habit of using it anyway
[14:17:06] <Eviltwin> And it keeps it clear
[14:17:31] <Eviltwin> But .closest(".embed, .listevent") sort of has an implied .first() in a sense
[14:20:31] <abletony84> Eviltwin: any clue how to make it step properly in your testcase?
[14:21:03] <Eviltwin> Well not knowing what "properly" is, I don't know
[14:22:06] <abletony84> Eviltwin: in your testcase it skips all the steps in between the first and the last
[14:22:54] <abletony84> Eviltwin: maybe we should add back the appendTo($step) and look for an alternative solution?
[14:23:29] <Eviltwin> abletony84: I'm seeing all the steps happen. Please make sure you're looking at the right version
[14:24:20] <abletony84> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPE4/9/ right? clicking the Next button works, but when I attempt to step by clicking on the radio button, it fast-forwards to the last step
[14:24:40] <p3rtutt1> I've got a question, if we have a function that requires jquery 1.5 (e.g) if I update jquery to 1.6, it will work?
[14:25:05] <abletony84> Eviltwin: it's like.. in the steps that only has radios, i'd give the ul class="steppable" so the user doesnt have to click the next button but can rather just use the radios directly
[14:26:08] <Eviltwin> Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPE4/10/
[14:27:36] <abletony84> Eviltwin: cool! thanks man!
[14:27:42] <yen_> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nil-zacharias/vegan-recipes_b_996355.html#
[14:28:16] <abletony84> Eviltwin: would you try to combine that with the below function seeing as how they repeat a lot of the same stuff?
[14:28:34] <abletony84> or is it cool the way it is
[14:28:49] <jedimind> cna you wildcard removeClass ?
[14:28:59] <jedimind> removeClass('foo-*')
[14:29:03] <jedimind> can*
[14:29:41] <Eviltwin> abletony84: Up to you
[14:30:22] <shoky> jedimind: removeClass takes a function parameter
[14:30:58] <abletony84> hmmm
[14:32:01] <shoky> jedimind: hmm nevermind seems it's not what you need
[14:32:09] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[14:32:16] <Eviltwin> It's kinda funky
[14:32:32] <Eviltwin> You probably want to use a split -> filter -> join approach
[14:32:35] <Eviltwin> On the class attribute
[14:32:44] <Eviltwin> Or a hacky regex replace on it
[14:33:32] <Eviltwin> Like $.trim((' ' + el.className + ' ').replace(/ foo-[^ ]* /g, " "))
[14:33:42] <Eviltwin> And set that to the className
[14:33:50] <Eviltwin> Err set the className to that

[14:40:17] <abletony84> I tried reversing the stuff of FEATURE B which is the "Next" button going forward, but...
[14:42:11] <jimi_> What causes bad control character in string literal ?
[14:43:29] <Eviltwin> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPE4/13/
[14:44:10] <tw2113> kontoo, http://jsbin.com/ifijah/1/edit
[14:44:41] <tw2113> just as a quick example
[14:46:08] <jedimind> Eviltwin, yeah that looks sadly overkill for what i need
[14:46:08] <jedimind> hrmm
[14:46:22] <kontoo> tw2113: that's good!! thanks alot mate :P
[14:46:34] <kontoo> tw2113: gonna implement it quick
[14:46:38] <Eviltwin> jedimind: What do you need?
[14:46:39] <tw2113> a simple click event to toggle a class that moves the content
[14:46:43] <tw2113> adjust as necessary
[14:47:19] <jedimind> well literally just need to do a wildcard selector for removeClass
[14:47:24] <Eviltwin> ...
[14:47:29] <jedimind> but yeah,
[14:47:54] <jedimind> i'll regexp it
[14:48:32] <Eviltwin> The reason this isn't built in is because it's kind of a nasty thing to do
[14:48:44] <Eviltwin> And likely means you've gone horribly wrong in your design
[14:48:47] <jedimind> not really
[14:48:57] <jedimind> i have a number of .widget boxes with additional classes that define their column size
[14:49:19] <jedimind> so id like to remove .col-* on any of the matched .widgets
[14:49:27] <abletony84> Eviltwin: thank you so much man.....
[14:49:32] <jedimind> without implicitly checking for each of the col- classes
[14:50:02] <jedimind> here's an earlier version of what im doing as a whole http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/VEJBm/6/
[14:50:04] <jedimind> just to give you an idea
[14:51:11] <Eviltwin> So...how's this relevant?
[14:51:23] <jedimind> relevant to what?
[14:51:49] <Eviltwin> Oh, you mean .*-col?
[14:51:52] <jedimind> yeah
[14:51:53] <jedimind> sorry
[14:52:36] <Eviltwin> I'd say the right approach is probably .removeClass("one-col two-col three-col") if you really don't know which one it is
[14:52:56] <Eviltwin> So that it's clear what classes you're potentially removing
[14:53:13] <jedimind> yeah i suppose
[14:53:25] <jedimind> thing is, ultimately there may be more classes added
[14:53:32] <jedimind> four-col five-col etc
[14:54:09] <Eviltwin> Sounds kinda nasty to me
[14:54:57] <jedimind> yeah, maybe
[14:55:27] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: perhaps this would help: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[14:55:44] <jedimind> yeah, i have no problem selecting them
[14:55:48] <jedimind> but im looking for a .removeClass method
[14:55:52] <ryanneufeld> oh my bad
[14:56:25] <jedimind> so each one of the widgets has a default size that comes as part of rendering the page. however, each one also has .data attribute that specifies what the max/min amount of columns any given widget can take up
[14:56:30] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: you know you can pass as function to removeClass() ?
[14:56:43] <jedimind> and so, as part of my adaptive grid, if any one of the elements is missing, it tries to fill in the gaps
[14:56:55] <ryanneufeld> that's a cool idea
[14:56:58] <jedimind> so it'll search for elements which have .data attribute that states that it can have a minimum of 1 column
[14:57:03] <jedimind> and then willr emove whatever *-col size it has
[14:57:06] <shoky> kontoo: a bit late, but maybe it'll be of help: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VBRs5/
[14:57:06] <jedimind> and set one-col instead
[14:57:37] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: well, you could pass a callback function into removeClass(), and use that to check
[15:04:14] <jedimind> yeah, im just .. i dont know what id return to it
[15:04:19] <jedimind> every possible *-col ?
[15:05:07] <jedimind> though.... i suppose i can just .split the .attr('class'); find col-* and then remove that implicitly
[15:05:10] <jedimind> for that element
[15:08:13] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: well, how many of the cols could it have?
[15:10:39] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/38fpU/
[15:10:44] <ryanneufeld> you can start with that
[15:12:47] <shoky> removeClass already provides the old class as 2nd argument
[15:14:59] <shoky> personally i'd go with what Eviltwin said..
[15:15:06] <shoky> .removeClass("one-col two-col three-col")
[15:15:17] <jedimind> yeah, though, jsut dont want to paint myself into a corner
[15:15:28] <jedimind> in the eventuality we need to add four-col or five-col or six-col down the road
[15:15:34] <shoky> removeClass( ['one','two','three','four','etc',''].join('-col ') )
[15:15:53] <shoky> then just remove them..
[15:16:01] <jedimind> yeah i guess that works
[15:16:07] <jedimind> im being a little pedantic
[15:16:07] <shoky> unless you think you'll have more than 10 or something ;p
[15:16:22] <jedimind> not realistically, no
[15:16:23] <shoky> then you really need to think of a different way to approach it probably
[15:16:31] <shoky> *then you'd
[15:21:50] <jimi_> How can I tell where in my JSON a problem is?
[15:24:56] <silverwind> In your head :/
[15:25:18] <jimi_> heh
[15:25:24] <jimi_> All it says is illegal character
[15:25:25] <silverwind> You could use an online tool like jsonlint
[15:25:38] <jimi_> silverwind, jsonlint says valid..
[15:25:42] <silverwind> Hmm
[15:26:01] <silverwind> Do you do anything special to load it?
[15:26:26] <jimi_> jquery.parseJSON('....')
[15:26:38] <sw33tlull4by> hi there, this question was also posted to jqueryui-dev, it beeing a devchannel i think it is no wonder i got ignored, so, maybe s.o. can help me here, http://pastebin.com/dkEBE7ud shows an html-snippet working just fine, problem is that i cannot let the checkboxes show up as checked, once checked using JS, .button('refresh') is causing trouble, demanding button to be called first, in order to initialize, (i wonder what the ui was doi
[15:26:40] <walidvb> question: i made this jsfiddle, and i log a var called next, which is an argument of a callback function of th cycle plugin.
[15:27:26] <silverwind> jimi_: If the information isn't sensitive, you could try making a live testcase of it using jsfiddle
[15:27:36] <jimi_> ok
[15:27:38] <walidvb> when i transferred it to my site, rather than the pure HTML, i get an HTMLDivElement, which I can not use as context!
[15:27:52] <walidvb> as in $('.mydiv', context)
[15:28:06] <walidvb> could someone explain what the difference is?
[15:28:46] <silverwind> walidvb: You understand what the context is?
[15:28:48] <jimi_> silverwind, http://jsfiddle.net/d7QqV/
[15:29:06] <walidvb> silverwind: i do guess what it is, but i never actually read it.
[15:29:26] <walidvb> silverwind: to me, it is simply a limitation within which a function will be called?
[15:30:48] <silverwind> walidvb: It's the node in the dom where the lookup starts
[15:30:54] <silverwind> By default, it's the document
[15:31:13] <walidvb> right. just read this ;)
[15:31:39] <walidvb> so in my jsfiddle, i don't really log a node, then... but the innerHTML of a node..?
[15:33:05] <silverwind> HTML isn't nodes before you $('html here') it
[15:33:34] <silverwind> jimi_: That's a weird one :/
[15:33:52] <silverwind> jimi_: What generates that JSON?
[15:34:03] <jimi_> silverwind, found it... there is a hidden \n some where... i did a replace, and it worked... but jsonlint still thought it was valid.. they must do the same
[15:34:38] <walidvb> silverwind: hm... the weird thing is i copied that fiddle to my site, and logging 'next', rather than printing the html, prints an HTMLDivElement.
[15:35:22] <walidvb> silverwind: here: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UZYmf/
[15:37:02] <silverwind> jimi_: I think I found
[15:37:14] <silverwind> jimi_: The parser hates the \n in it
[15:38:11] <walidvb> silverwind: hmm..... if I reload my site's page, it switches between the HTML_code and HTMLDivElement.... clear cache, maybe..?
[15:38:18] <jimi_> silverwind, i agree.. but it doesnt show in jslint.. so i didnt see it
[15:38:51] <silverwind> walidvb: That's very strange.
[15:39:23] <walidvb> extremely. but i promess it does. once every two times. just cleared site's and browser cache(chrome)
[15:39:33] <walidvb> silverwind: and as you can see the fiddle is working..
[15:40:53] <silverwind> Oh my, just saw the fiddle..
[15:40:56] <silverwind> 2 seconds.
[15:43:48] <walidvb> silverwind: hm.. log is still the same, but i corrected an error and the script is now working.
[15:44:16] <walidvb> but i still get a different log on each refresh..
[15:44:50] <silverwind> I don't know much about that plugin... but if it works, wonderful
[15:46:20] <walidvb> it does :) it's a slideshow plugin, you use another one?
[15:50:04] <walidvb> silverwind: but thanks! :)
[15:50:11] <walidvb> i go sleep now :)
[15:50:13] <walidvb> bye!
[15:56:04] <kamoricks> How can I tell how many handlers are registered to a given event on a given selector? I think I may be binding multiple identical .click() listeners, but need to confirm.
[16:02:53] <Slayed> @kamoricks is this what you want? $('#some-id-here').data('events');
[16:02:53] <b-ot> Slayed, memorised “kamoricks”.
[16:03:05] <Slayed> Er...whoops...
[16:08:53] <kamoricks> Slayed: Yes. Thanks. (It was deep inside how we load "self-contained" "dynamic" ajax "component objects", which was such fun I decided to just unbind-rebind rather than fix the mess).
[16:11:59] <Slayed> Going for the old shotgun approach? When it comes to fixing something, break it all and try again?
[16:13:18] <kamoricks> Slayed: I was trying to figure out why days were advancing by two on click. Turned out the click handler was registered twice. The click handler is registered as part of component registration.
[16:13:57] <kamoricks> Slayed: Also part of component registration is the bit where it reconstitutes a global array into DOM objects through several other methods, and where it registers a .refresh() method to the object to call itself when an ajax callback is triggered.
[16:14:11] <Emn1ty> Anyone know how to create a masking div? http://jsfiddle.net/CEBuB/ - I want the grey div to mask the outlined div.
[16:14:35] <kamoricks> Slayed: This means all our components refresh on every ajax event, but that's not the issue. The issue is that the click handler is a closure that doesn't use the global array, but local variables from the reconstituted function... meaning it has to be unregistered and rebound on every change.
[16:28:10] <Emn1ty> Anyone know how to create a masking div? http://jsfiddle.net/CEBuB/ - I want the grey div to mask the outlined div.
[16:28:38] <Emn1ty> updated version - http://jsfiddle.net/CEBuB/7/

[16:39:44] <Emn1ty> boulet101010: I want the div visible inside the mask (so if the mask is off to the side, the text isn't visible)
[16:40:00] <Emn1ty> basicall, like this site's image: http://www.rumaenisch-dolmetschen.de/index.html
[16:40:04] <Emn1ty> basically*
[16:40:23] <Emn1ty> but that uses background position, which I can't use in this instance
[16:40:35] <boulet101010> ok so css2 ?
[16:40:56] <Emn1ty> no, I just want the effect of it revealing the text
[16:41:00] <Emn1ty> not covering the text
[16:41:11] <Emn1ty> the only reason the box is grey is so you can see where it is
[16:41:33] <boulet101010> yes i understand, but so you want it to reveal the text from the left to the right?
[16:42:18] <Emn1ty> yes
[16:42:26] <boulet101010> oh lol just saw on the website
[16:43:21] <boulet101010> so the only thing you want is that the grey box covers the border? i would suggest to make a second mask before the grey one and to apply border on it
[16:44:01] <Emn1ty> no, I want it to reveal the inner div
[16:44:16] <Emn1ty> using overflow:hidden and moving the div across it.
[16:45:07] <Emn1ty> mask |] goes to  [- div displayed - ]. Perhaps width would be better?
[16:46:12] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/CEBuB/9/ like this so?
[16:47:05] <Emn1ty> boulet101010: yes, but if I make the mask transparent then it won't work.
[16:48:28] <boulet101010> lol ok
[16:48:35] <Emn1ty> boulet101010: think of cutting the mask out of a piece of paper. You get the piece, and then the paper with the hole in it.
[16:48:40] <Emn1ty> I want the paper with the hole in it.
[16:48:45] <Emn1ty> not the piece you cut out
[16:48:49] <boulet101010> but don't you want just to enlarge progressivly the text div?
[16:49:13] <Emn1ty> I want the look of the border drawing itself.
[16:49:24] <Emn1ty> not expanding with a div
[16:50:33] <tw2113> woo! "Permission denied to access property 'toString'" errors
[16:50:42] <tw2113> with zero line number indication
[16:54:37] <boulet101010> and you want that to be transparent Emn1ty , i think this to be tricky now .

[17:11:18] <adlwalrus> shoky: but would you say that >90% of plugins and code will continue to work?
[17:11:33] <shoky> adlwalrus: i have no idea
[17:11:49] <adlwalrus> shoky: k, fair enough. thanks.
[17:12:10] <shoky> adlwalrus: well yeah if something was written for 1.7.2 then i probably >90% of those will be ok in 1.8
[17:12:34] <adlwalrus> shoky: k, sweet.  thanks :)
[17:18:36] <int_64> Hi..looked around but need some advice. if someone would be kind enough to answer....I am looking for a framework, based on PHP and Jquery, that handles all (or 90%) of the Jquery/javascript for me..that is, you do nearly all your development in PHP, and the Jquery is automatically generated
[17:18:45] <int_64> What are some matrue, stable options?
[17:20:38] <zapsoda> What is the simplest way to have a custom scrollbar on my site since i kinda fail at setting one up
[17:24:21] <boulet101010> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/side-scroll.html like this?
[17:26:03] <ameoba> Having a problem with a JQuery UI datepicker.  I have it displaying on a div, stuffing the value in a hidden form element.  I can't get the onChange to register on the form element.  Is there something simple I'm doing wrong, or am I stuck with it?
[17:26:46] <zapsoda> ty boulet101010
[17:32:07] <jeraldv> int_64: Zend Framework has very good jquery integration
[17:33:05] <tyoc213> Wazup there, if I want to match something like a regex say $("#start_name_*")
[17:33:11] <tyoc213> how I will handle it?
[17:40:04] <smithbh> tyoc213: $('[id*="start_name_"]').command();
[17:40:26] <int_64> thanks jeraldv
[17:40:36] <int_64> after all these years I still have yet to actually use zend framework
[17:44:24] <tyoc213> smithbh: what if I need start_name_*_end_name?
[17:51:53] <boulet101010> $("[id^='start_name'][id$='end_name']") maybe
[18:10:05] <smithbh> tyoc213: boulet101010 is correct, $('[id^="prefix"][id$="suffix"]').command();
[18:10:18] <tyoc213> ey, thx
[18:10:26] <tyoc213> and interesting
[18:18:34] <adlwalrus> i know it isn't jquery, but anyone know why "peekabo" isn't showing? http://fiddle.jshell.net/uyCwx/show/light/
[18:26:51] <shoky> adlwalrus: display:none  ?
[18:28:54] <adlwalrus> shoky: but look underneat that at the :target ~ #target selector.
[18:29:15] <shoky> so you mean after clicking the link?
[18:32:29] <shoky> adlwalrus: that's how you do it http://fiddle.jshell.net/uyCwx/1/
[18:33:32] <shoky> adlwalrus: you didn't even have an element with id="target" ..
[18:33:43] <shoky> yet your selector had #target
[18:34:25] <shoky> oh sorry, just noticed that div on the bottom..
[18:37:51] <shoky> adlwalrus: A ~ B means that B appears _after_ A
[18:38:03] <shoky> adlwalrus: http://fiddle.jshell.net/uyCwx/2/
[18:50:13] <phonebook_> hi jquery
[18:50:20] <adlwalrus> phonebook_: helloo
[18:50:47] <phonebook_> helloo
[18:50:58] <phonebook_> excuse irc manners PLS
[19:02:44] <adlwalrus> oh, and thanks shoky!
[19:03:06] <methods> is there no way to request a shallow .text()  ? i mean only concat text nodes for 1 level deep
[19:04:42] <phonebook_> .html().substring(0, .html().indexOf("<") is my answer
[19:04:55] <phonebook_> i had this same problem a couple days ago
[19:05:16] <methods> index of < /
[19:05:17] <methods> ?
[19:05:24] <methods> oh you got hte html..
[19:05:29] <phonebook_> rughto
[19:05:34] <phonebook_> *righto
[19:05:51] <methods> mine was right in the middle of two other tags
[19:06:04] <methods> yea i mean it's easy to write a little routine that just concats textNode's which I did but was just curious
[19:06:12] <coldhead> $('thing').clone().find('* *').remove().end().text()
[19:06:32] <methods> ah!
[19:06:33] <methods> nice!
[19:07:53] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[19:07:53] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus’ hangin’ ’n’ chillin’
[19:08:06] <rmurphey> sup with you coldhead
[19:08:45] <tw2113> yo people and coldhead
[19:08:54] <phonebook_> what does * * do?
[19:09:00] <methods> i changed it to *
[19:09:06] <phonebook_> all non root elements?
[19:09:21] <coldhead> Not much Mr Murphey, jus' hangin' 'n' chillin'
[19:09:25] <methods> anything wiht a space ?
[19:09:52] <coldhead> * * means grandchildren
[19:09:56] <coldhead> and their descendants
[19:09:58] <phonebook_> its all non root elements fool
[19:10:06] <coldhead> actually * * doesn't even work, i am full of shit
[19:10:30] <coldhead> .children().find('*').remove() is more what i was going for
[19:10:31] <b-ot> coldhead, memorised “children().find('*').remove()”.
[19:10:39] <coldhead> thanks so much, b-ot
[19:10:45] <coldhead> you memorise all the gold
[19:10:56] <methods> it memorizes why ?
[19:11:07] <shoky> it'll come in handy some day
[19:11:33] <shoky> it's very selective, very secretive like that.
[19:12:27] <methods> so is there no way to just say .find( textNode's ) ?
[19:12:39] <methods> nvm
[19:12:46] <phonebook_> i want this too
[19:12:48] <methods> maybe if find had a depth arg
[19:13:22] <coldhead> i think you have to resort to vanilla JS for textnode manipulation
[19:13:25] <phonebook_> maybe a magical regex using .innerHTML
[19:13:46] <methods> to do what ?
[19:14:12] <phonebook_> read the first html  <
[19:14:26] <phonebook_> as opposed to anythig that might get in htere that is a < but not html
[19:15:07] <phonebook_> im pretty sure its impossible
[19:15:23] <manster> is there someway to create a text element within jquery and do calculations on it without it ever being displayed on the page?
[19:15:40] <phonebook_> diplay:none
[19:15:46] <phonebook_> put that in the dom
[19:16:03] <coldhead> .find('*').remove().end().text() should get you just the stuff outside of <tags>
[19:16:11] <phonebook_> trust me, i have used that a lot... for measurements even
[19:17:21] <gh0st> so which language is it that can auto-update my page with results from a mysql query?
[19:17:26] <phonebook_> i dont understand .end and jquery documentation on it is too difficult
[19:18:04] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/Nh4YL/
[19:18:15] <rmurphey> phonebook_: .end() just un-does the last operation that changed the selection
[19:18:32] <rmurphey> so if you do var foo = $('#foo').find('span').addClass('bar').end();
[19:18:37] <rmurphey> then foo will be $('#foo')
[19:18:37] <coldhead> in this case it undoes the find() and takes you back to the original selection
[19:18:49] <rmurphey> or just listen to coldhead :)
[19:19:38] <manster> phonebook_: measuring is exacly what i'm trying to do
[19:20:33] <manster> thanks i'll give that a try
[19:22:10] <phonebook_> <div style="display:none;">some text i want to measure</div> put that anyywhere
[19:22:31] <phonebook_> and you can just do a .width on the div
[19:24:50] <phonebook_> or .outerwidth(
[19:28:59] <phonebook_> rmurphey why would you want to undo the last if you explicitly wrote it down?
[19:29:15] <rmurphey> phonebook_: i am no fan of .end()
[19:29:25] <rmurphey> and i think that good code has no use for it
[19:29:39] <rmurphey> but i was just explaining how it works
[19:29:48] <sample> hello
[19:30:16] <phonebook_> i think i get it
[19:30:28] <rmurphey> it lets you preserve the chain
[19:30:40] <rmurphey> which, well
[19:31:17] <phonebook_> maybe not - okay ill stare at docs
[19:33:02] <sample> hello there , i have some question
[19:34:00] <phonebook_> what is your question?
[19:38:11] <john__> hello there
[19:38:21] <coldhead> end() is fine, how dare you hate on it
[19:42:57] <phonebook_> i still done know what it does to be honest.
[19:43:17] <phonebook_> probably because i am such a good programmer
[19:43:46] <coldhead> and i am such a dreadful one
[19:43:56] <coldhead> that's probably quite right
[19:47:54] <phonebook_> end  is if you want to drill down to a selector BUT you want to drill down to selectors that only have child elements with some other selector?
[19:51:57] <phonebook_> i could have learned and forgotten about .end by now. but this is recess
[19:53:13] <coldhead> end() is when you want to do something with parts of your selection and then go back to the original
[19:53:19] <garciawebdev> good morning
[19:53:38] <garciawebdev> can you help me?
[19:53:44] <garciawebdev> I don't know why the text llo
[19:53:52] <coldhead> like $('a').filter('.someclass').css('font-weight', 'bold').end().css('opacity', 0.5)
[19:54:06] <garciawebdev> sorry, I don't know why the text looks so weird while it fades in
[19:54:07] <garciawebdev> file://localhost/Users/alejandro/Workspace/edithlara.com.ar/index.html#/filosofia
[19:54:11] <garciawebdev> sorry
[19:54:14] <phonebook_> thats flipping crazy
[19:54:24] <garciawebdev> that's not the URL
[19:54:24] <phonebook_> i can select all elements without end
[19:54:42] <coldhead> but when you don't want ALL of them, phonebook_
[19:55:07] <coldhead> the code above gives ALL <a>s 50% opacity and only the <a>s with someclass get bolded
[19:55:25] <coldhead> anyway if you don't see a use for it then just forget you ever saw it
[19:56:08] <phonebook_> no fine, im trying to understand it now
[19:56:20] * phonebook_ concentrates *needs another beer
[19:56:28] * phonebook_ concentrates - concentrates
[19:56:49] <phonebook_> ALL elements - but dont need. gah
[19:57:59] <coldhead> mr. murphey is a duly lauded javascript celebrity, just do what he says
[19:58:44] <phonebook_> its not that i dont get it
[19:59:28] <phonebook_> its just that i am trying to think of a practical example of where to use it
[19:59:50] <tw2113> the murph?
[19:59:52] <phonebook_> better than using .parent or .closest?
[19:59:56] <coldhead> here is a trivial example of where i used it today, phonebook_
[20:00:00] <phonebook_> pls
[20:00:18] <coldhead> my cow orker had some code that returns a particular widget instance
[20:00:22] <coldhead> $el = this.element()
[20:00:27] <coldhead> he's an idiot
[20:00:39] <coldhead> but so i needed a way to add an extra element to that
[20:00:40] <phonebook_> arent we all
[20:00:45] <tw2113> i am
[20:01:14] <coldhead> so i did this.element().nextAll('.someSibling').andSelf()
[20:01:23] <coldhead> oops that was andself(), not end()
[20:01:28] <coldhead> my example is irrelevant
[20:01:37] <phonebook_> i wish i worked with you
[20:02:14] <phonebook_> k, understood
[20:02:30] <phonebook_> all siblings?
[20:02:49] <phonebook_> this is a waste of timer im totally hammered as you may have been informed by now
[20:03:07] <phonebook_> ill stop talking. i know how you pplz hate that
[20:03:15] <coldhead> wait, i found an actual example
[20:03:18] <coldhead> $box.find('.kr').hide().end().find('.influence, .outreach').show();
[20:03:24] <coldhead> that could have been in too lines
[20:03:30] <coldhead> but end() lets me do it in one
[20:03:52] <coldhead> so given this $box element, i want to hide some children and show others
[20:04:06] <coldhead> end() lets me undo the find to then select the other elements and show them
[20:05:34] <phonebook_> fuck that
[20:05:40] <phonebook_> and thats not me having had too many
[20:05:49] <phonebook_> by the time i am relying on jquery that much i have a problem
[20:05:52] <phonebook_> thats my opinion
[20:06:06] <phonebook_> i woudlnt use it
[20:06:12] <phonebook_> style difference
[20:06:49] <coldhead> yes well, whatever floats your boats
[20:07:00] <phonebook_> agreed
[20:07:16] <coldhead> one of our files is 7000 lines of JS
[20:07:30] <phonebook_> whats it do?
[20:07:31] <coldhead> so if end() helps me not add more to that than i have to, i likee
[20:07:37] <phonebook_> no thats cool
[20:07:40] <coldhead> fucking everything, in a very terrible way
[20:07:43] <phonebook_> maytbe different environment
[20:07:48] <phonebook_> *maybe
[20:07:52] <coldhead> mostly it gives me ulcers and despair
[20:08:00] <phonebook_> ha ha hiyoo
[20:08:22] <phonebook_> i have a couple files that equal about that much and do the same
[20:08:50] <coldhead> my condolences
[20:08:53] <phonebook_> and nobody understands them but me.. .probably because im a bad programmer
[20:09:19] <coldhead> you said you were a good programmer!
[20:09:24] <coldhead> and mr murphey agreed!
[20:09:29] <phonebook_> wait
[20:09:39] <phonebook_> the truth is atm it IS because im a bad programmer
[20:09:45] <phonebook_> but i have these great ideas...
[20:10:03] <phonebook_> jquery plugins included (dont boot me)
[20:11:36] <phonebook_> i just learned how to write plugins a couple days ago
[20:11:43] <phonebook_> wrote my own draggable and tagName
[20:11:52] <phonebook_> yay me
[20:12:49] <phonebook_> and now sadly i am the only one that understands the js file
[20:13:32] <coldhead> aye, that's a tough one
[20:13:39] <phonebook_> for realz
[20:13:43] <coldhead> one of my peers is too clever by half and does everything in the most clever way possible
[20:13:46] <phonebook_> ive been a developer for 9 months
[20:13:47] <coldhead> which takes ages to understand
[20:13:57] <phonebook_> i wish i had a jquery developer to learn from
[20:13:59] <coldhead> but i am too old and tired to begrudge him
[20:14:05] <coldhead> i just drink more champagne for breakfast
[20:14:09] <coldhead> and wait for the day to be over
[20:14:14] <phonebook_> i like you coldhead
[20:14:27] <coldhead> FINALLY
[20:14:29] <phonebook_> because you talk to me and drink at breakfast
[20:14:34] <coldhead> i've been waiting my whole life to hear that
[20:14:40] <coldhead> IN YOUR FACE, MOM AND DAD
[20:14:57] <phonebook_> div mom and dad
[20:14:58] <ngharo> hi coldhead
[20:17:37] <coldhead> hallo ngharo
[20:19:33] <ngharo> how is your jquery learnings progressing being your second day and all?
[20:44:57] <synth3tk> trying to use toggleClass. a link should hide a div, the link is not a part of the div. it works, but clicking anywhere on the page also toggles the class. i ONLY want the link to display/hide the class.
[20:45:01] <synth3tk> http://jsfiddle.net/Gwy2k/1/
[21:01:08] <shoky> synth3tk: there's $(document).ready(function() { .... });   and there's  $('someSelector').click(function() { ... } )
[21:01:13] <shoky> you mixed them together..
[21:01:30] <synth3tk> yeah, someone in another channel pointed it out. i've got it sorted now. thanks!
[21:03:55] <smithbh> synth3tk http://jsfiddle.net/Gwy2k/3/ from the unnecessary third response
[21:04:41] <synth3tk> haha, thanks for the confirmation.
[21:08:32] <foozo> Greetings.
[21:09:29] <foozo> I have a form.. let's call it #myform. It has several <input type="text"> elements. How can I clear the values from all of the textboxes in that #myform?
[21:11:37] <foozo> $('#myform').each(function() { this.reset() }); ?
[21:18:51] <coldhead> ngharo: it's my first day, silly
[21:21:28] <smithbh> foozo $('#myform input').val('');
[21:22:57] <foozo> smithbh: thanks, yours works too :)
[21:28:24] <blackpowa> haelp
[21:28:48] <blackpowa> does anyone here have any experience with novo?
[21:32:17] <coldhead> i have never heard of that sorry blackpowa
[21:32:40] <blackpowa> http://nivo.dev7studios.com/
[21:32:47] <coldhead> oh THAT thing
[21:35:28] <blackpowa> I can't get it to
[21:35:40] <blackpowa> work
[21:35:42] <coldhead> i gather it is hard to get going, i've never tried
[21:35:47] <coldhead> but i have seen a lot of people struggling
[21:35:52] <coldhead> i don't know what the magic bullet it
[21:35:54] <coldhead> persistence
[21:35:55] <coldhead> maybe
[21:38:07] <blackpowa> http://pastebin.com/3BN9K6n0
[21:38:17] <blackpowa> this si my code
[21:41:34] <blackpowa> i think I'm just gonna stick a functioning nivo page i have as a frame
[21:41:42] <blackpowa> since i can't seem to get it to work integrated
[22:07:21] <kurol> work is the integration of force over distance
[22:13:53] <samy_> what is up
[22:29:14] <xpuecnig> I wonder why it doesn't work when i use the autocomplete plugin in IE 8? I can not highlight the keywords by just replace each search result item with something like "<font color=\"Red\">"+keyword+"</font>"
[22:29:59] <xpuecnig> I appreciate it in advance
[22:31:23] <xpuecnig> everything is fine in FF and IE 6 and IE 7 and IE 9+
[23:01:54] <EnginA> '#menu .file>.new' not a valid selector ?
[23:02:13] <EnginA> .file is a deep child of #menu and .new is immediate child of .file
[23:02:14] <b-ot> EnginA, memorised “file”.
[23:02:45] <EnginA> .forget file
[23:02:46] <b-ot> EnginA, I have forgotten “file”.
[23:05:35] <EnginA> hmm looks like something else modified the DOM in between, that's probably why it failed
