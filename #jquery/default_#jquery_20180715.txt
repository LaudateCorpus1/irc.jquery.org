[07:13:07] <Eyyyy> Hey guys
[07:13:21] <Eyyyy> Is there a reliable way to add a class to a div once a link is clicked?
[07:13:31] <Eyyyy> Basically whenever  the page is being left
[07:13:44] <Eyyyy> As soon as a request is made to leave the page, just add a class to a global div
[07:17:26] <pavonia> Doesn't .unload() work?
[07:17:54] <pavonia> Why do you need a style change on leave, btw?
[07:19:23] <Eyyyy> pavonia basically there's a preloader involved already
[07:19:40] <Eyyyy> If I fade it in onleave it may seem a bit more seamless
[23:16:41] <Chaos_Therum> Hey so I'm having some problems with a piece of code that is just killing me. So what I want it to do is create li elements that are pointing to /img/gallery/thumbnails/  what I'm getting is that it's pointing to /img/gallery/  I've been beating my head against this for like an hour.

[23:39:07] <buu> Since when did $(foo).attr() take a callback as the second argument
