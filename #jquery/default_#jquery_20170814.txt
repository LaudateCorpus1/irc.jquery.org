[00:12:14] <newcoder> Hi, can we use only javascript instead of jquery?
[00:12:20] <newcoder> When do we need to use jquery?
[00:14:31] <Uhkis> 1) yes 2) never
[00:16:56] <newcoder> Uhkis: So why do you use jqeury?
[00:18:14] <Uhkis> it saves a lot of typing
[00:23:13] <newcoder> Uhkis: Then why did you say: 2) never?
[00:24:18] <Uhkis> because there's no *need* to use it, it's just a convenience factor
[00:30:14] <newcoder> *no need to use it* but you use it?
[00:53:42] <Jonno_FTW> when uising .submit(function) on a form, how do I make it continue on to do the regular post request?
[00:54:06] <Jonno_FTW> actually nvm, I'll just update some hidden fields from my dynamic form element
[01:46:32] <futzhu> my boss ask me to use react JS wile i never use it before. i still learn jquery. is it bad and hard to learn react js?
[01:55:13] <Uhkis> futzhu: tell your boss to read the license of react
[02:09:09] <Cork> lol
[02:09:13] <Cork> Uhkis++
[02:26:13] <futzhu> Uhkis: lol he doesn't care with license i think
[02:36:45] * Kartagis is confused
[02:37:28] <Kartagis> I just read react licence. is there a clause preventing usage of some kind?
[02:38:08] <Kartagis> license?
[02:50:57] <Uhkis> Kartagis: check the patents part
[02:53:48] <Kartagis> no part named patents at https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE
[02:54:01] <Kartagis> am I on the wrong thing?
[02:54:23] <Uhkis> https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/PATENTS
[02:54:50] <Kartagis> oh, a separate file
[05:12:24] <Robin___> Hello. Im trying to save order from sorting different divs, but it always resets. Thankful for any help :) https://jsfiddle.net/a7197ymw/1/
[05:12:56] <nardev> hello guys, i hava a for with fields in array  like this <input name="something[]" .../>.. is there any way to populate those fields i tried "starting with something" but it didn't work
[06:10:00] <pavonia> nardev: Show what you have tried
[06:12:05] * AdamPDotty tries to decipher.
[06:13:32] <nardev> pavonia, thank you. i had completely other typo in the code.. that is why it was not working thnx
[06:16:18] <AdamPDotty> And I do not understand the fiddle either.
[06:26:44] <Robin___> Hello :) How to create and remove a div by clicking a button? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bc2e0a03817e5205bf4170b8deb75e98 Thanks
[06:26:55] <Robin___> I first created a boolean but it wouldnt work
[06:49:45] <AdamPDotty> you want $('#'+id).length instead of opened, then id instead of this.id and probaby remove() with filter (selector)
[06:50:39] <AdamPDotty> finally you might reduce the number of event handlers
[06:50:57] <Robin___> hmm let me try
[07:23:09] <Robin___> It kind of works. However the second time you click on the configure wheel the slider wont show up. Why is that? :) https://jsfiddle.net/p6tn8m2o/ Thanks
[07:57:08] <Cork> Robin___: you can't use localStorage in jsfiddle so the example doesn't work
[08:03:28] * Kartagis notes that localStorage thing
[08:04:06] <Cork> Kartagis: for reference they have <iframe sandbox=""> and it blocks localstorage there
[08:04:21] <Cork> and that is why it doesn't work
[08:05:09] <Kartagis> I was beginning to despise jsfiddle after their upgrade, and this one became the icing
[08:05:25] <Cork> ya, well they have a point
[08:05:47] <Cork> as localstorage is per domain you can leak very sensitive data between fiddles
[08:06:26] <Cork> and to date i haven't seen an alternative that is actually reliable
[08:07:31] <Robin___> Cork: thx for noticing. i dont know how to show it in another way
[08:08:51] <Cork> ah
[08:08:54] <Cork> now i see the problem though
[08:09:07] <Cork> you run .slider() on the parent element
[08:09:15] <Cork> i suspect you intend to run it on the new div?
[08:09:56] <Cork> Robin___: https://jsfiddle.net/p6tn8m2o/1/
[08:11:16] <Kartagis> Cork: okay I get the localStorage poing, but there are more reasons. they don't allow http anymore (sucks when you make an ajax request to http site) is one
[08:11:46] <Cork> Kartagis: the web is quite fast moving to a https only world
[08:11:52] <Cork> it won't be a problem for much longer
[08:13:02] <Kartagis> probably (definitely) that's me being lazy and not setting up ssl on my domain
[08:13:20] <Cork> Kartagis: and there is actually a good reason for requiering https on jsfiddle, some browser features doesn't exist on http
[08:13:36] <lclhst> Robin___: please work on your's code quality, this is fixed code: https://jsfiddle.net/p6tn8m2o/2/
[08:13:37] <Cork> so you can get a fiddle that works find, then it is loaded on http and it doesn't work
[08:13:54] <Kartagis> oh yeah? had no idea
[08:14:36] <Kartagis> but I still think they should allow http as well
[08:16:14] <Cork> possibly, but i see it as a real likelyhood of problem when there are more and more features that just don't work on http (like fetch or geolocation)
[08:17:32] <Cork> as let's encrypt is free and easy to use there really isn't a reason for any site to not support https anymore
[08:26:58] <Robin___> lclhst: thx alot. yes i will continue to practice :)
[09:25:29] <jan77> hi
[09:25:46] <MikeD_> hi
[09:27:00] <jan77> Is it possible to use a spinner (with beforeSend) in get()/post()/load() as well or can I do this only with ajax()?
[09:37:14] <Cork> jan77: get,post,load is just access helpers for ajax
[09:37:29] <Cork> and most of the options from ajax isn't exposed in them
[09:37:50] <Cork> (and for this reason there is very little reason to use $.get)
[09:38:12] <jan77> Cork: So it can't be done?
[09:38:40] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[09:38:44] <Cork> only option
[09:38:57] <Cork> aka, no
[09:41:10] <shoky> you can use $.get({url:..., beforeSend:...})   but you can just do whatever you want before calling $.get() ...
[09:41:55] <jan77> Well, the example on that page shows how to show a loading message using ajaxStart() with load.
[09:42:07] <shoky> you can do whatever you want before calling $.get
[09:42:23] <shoky> doSomethingBefore();   $.get(...);
[09:42:31] <shoky> pretty simple ;)
[09:43:46] <Cork> shoky: are you sure?
[09:43:55] <shoky> about what?
[09:43:57] <Cork> cause $.get takes url, data, callback
[09:44:07] <Cork> it doesn't have an options
[09:44:19] <Cork> so how would it support taking ajax options?
[09:44:21] <shoky> version added: 1.12/2.2   jQuery.get( [settings ] )
[09:44:44] <Cork> ah missed jQuery.isPlainObject( url )
[09:45:45] <Cork> well not sure why to go the round about way around $.get at that point
[09:46:07] <Cork> as it is just a rename of $.ajax except it throws some extra cycles to the pigs for no reason
[09:46:09] <shoky> indeed ;p
[09:55:54] <MikeD_> are those the same pigs we're typically putting lipstick on with sub-optimal solutions?
[09:56:24] <Cork> MikeD_: definitely :)
[10:16:55] <poboy> so I have this function and an "ServiceName" that is a dropdown with values between 0 and 2.  I want to show only the values that match the value in this function.  https://paste.laravel.io/jExw8#6
[10:17:02] <poboy> I'd really appreciate some help
[10:18:30] <Cork> poboy: you will have to build a list of options you want to show and replace the children in the select element with them
[10:19:04] <Cork> poboy: it is the only cross browser compatible solution (chrome throws up if you set display: none on an option element)
[10:19:34] <Cork> poboy: you don't have to create new elements though
[10:19:53] <Cork> just grab all the original options and then reuse that list each time you want to change the options
[10:20:09] <Cork> and just select out the elements you want to not include and then html(rest)
[10:21:18] <Cork> also you should not use .attr for form element states .prop is the command for that
[10:21:30] <Cork> (as .attr isn't cross browser compatible)
[10:22:04] <poboy> Cork: thanks, but now I'm more confused than before. :)
[10:22:08] <Cork> (unless you use jquery < 1.5 where .prop doesn't exist yet and .attr does both jobs)
[10:22:11] <poboy> the .prop makes sense
[10:24:12] <poboy> Cork:  I'm sorry but could you clarify "list of options you want to show and replace the children in the select element with them"
[10:25:43] <Cork> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/2z9vx1zy/ a very simple example
[10:27:18] <poboy> thank you
[10:28:31] <Cork> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/2z9vx1zy/1/ and here it is actually with running code
[10:32:08] <poboy> that's very helpful.   thanks again
[11:25:52] <ThijsW> Hi, Could someone explain me why my buttons won't direct on the first click? I have to click twice before it works.
[11:29:28] <poboy> Cork, (or anyone): why can't I do that as if statements?  https://paste.laravel.io/3XbpD
[11:46:29] <theology> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15647446/loading-a-page-via-ajax-into-div-best-practice (.load() is best practice for ajax page loads...?)
[11:48:24] <taplar> you don't load an entire page
[11:48:31] <taplar> you load fragments
[11:49:20] <taplar> <html><body><div><html>...</html></div></body></html> <--- bad markup
[11:53:20] <Cork> poboy: you need to filter the list of options
[11:53:26] <Cork> poboy: you can't really use an if case
[11:53:53] <poboy> sorry, I was brought in as php dev and am trying to get up to speed on jquery asap
[11:54:30] <Cork> poboy: best option is to do something like options.not(function(elm) { return elm.value == value; })
[11:54:32] <Cork> for example
[11:54:46] <Cork> it will remove the element not matching the "value" content
[14:57:56] <setuid> I'm working with jqplay, but I can't sesem to fiigure out the right filter to get the address value out of this key: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/1a471176/
[14:58:05] <setuid> I can get some values, like: jq -r '.[].state.memory.usage'
[14:58:26] <setuid> But I can't get networks.eth0.addresses.address
[14:58:32] <setuid> What am I doing wrong?
[14:59:19] <taplar> "network" is the key
[14:59:35] <taplar> and addresses is an array, so you'll have to use [] off of it to access a child
[15:00:02] <setuid> Even 'jq '.network[0]'' throws an error
[15:00:15] <taplar> though what you are asking about is object access, not specifically jQuery logic related
[15:00:25] <taplar> network isn't an array
[15:00:45] <taplar> "key": [ ... ] <-- an array
[15:00:58] <taplar> "key": { ... } <-- not
[15:02:14] <setuid> I've tried about 700 different filters, all with failure, except that one that extracts state.memory
[15:02:34] <setuid> THe construct is _exactly_ the same but for a different key, and it's just thrownig error after error after error
[15:02:54] <taplar> i just told you why you are getting access errors
[15:03:01] <taplar> feel free to ignore though
[15:04:00] <robertmaxrees> setuid yeah, listen to taplar.
[15:04:03] <setuid> Not ignoring, trying to get the values of the list items inside the 'addresses' key
[15:04:25] <robertmaxrees> right, which are inside other keys.
[15:04:25] <taplar> so look at the format of your json
[15:04:39] <taplar> keys with a value of an object are just "key"
[15:04:40] <setuid> it's a list, and I need to get to name.network.eth0.addresses.address
[15:04:50] <taplar> keys with a value of an array are "key"[#]
[15:04:50] <robertmaxrees> *object.
[15:05:03] <robertmaxrees> addresses is an array.
[15:05:09] <robertmaxrees> within an object.
[15:05:44] <taplar> state.memory.usage <-- works because none are arrays
[15:06:01] <setuid> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/cfa02ad5/
[15:06:34] <taplar> idk wtf that is
[15:06:43] <taplar> but looking at the actual json, you can see it's structure
[15:07:02] <setuid> Right, and I've followed the structure, to try to extract values of the list items
[15:07:05] <setuid> Without success
[15:07:08] <taplar> no, you haven't
[15:07:14] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried again?
[15:07:22] <taplar> as i've said, and robert has reiterated, addresses is an array
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> let's step through
[15:08:27] <setuid> Wait, I have it!  jq -r '.[].state.network.eth0.addresses[0].address'
[15:08:33] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[15:08:37] <setuid> a little toothy, but it works
[15:08:42] <taplar> toothy?
[15:10:38] <setuid> Yes, highly specific, won't work if there's an eth1, or some other interfaces, but for now, this will work
[15:10:54] <robertmaxrees> do you want all the addresses for each network device?
[15:11:12] <setuid> Just trying to learn how to parse this out with jq
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:11:27] <robertmaxrees> so you're not parsing it with jq.
[15:11:31] <robertmaxrees> that's just normal js.
[15:13:51] <setuid> Come again? That's not jquery?
[15:14:03] <robertmaxrees> nothing you're doing is using jquery.
[15:15:06] <robertmaxrees> also, fwiw: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/okkt4sn2/
[15:16:25] <robertmaxrees> you're probably using https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> which is not jquery :)
[15:20:19] <setuid> ah true, but every time I search up jq examples, they all refer back to jquery sites parsing json and dom :)
[15:20:40] <setuid> Err noted, sorry to bother!
[15:20:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:02] <Anthaas> Hi guys - can someone help me with this issue - I want my window to flip each time a new form is required, but for some reason I can't get the first form to show correctly after a certain path is shown.
[15:27:11] <Anthaas> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/
[15:27:18] <Anthaas> Login -> register -> login works, as does login -> forgot -> login, but login -> forgot -> reset -> login doesn't.
[15:27:25] <Anthaas> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/1/ is my attempt to hack a solution (which feels dirty), but in this I am not getting the animation when the login page is finally reloaded.
[15:28:38] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[15:29:31] <Anthaas> Ok, in the first link, the back of the form is shown rather than the front with the correct Y rotation, in the 2nd link, there is no animation between the reset page and the login page
[15:29:43] <robertmaxrees> ah, a specific use case doesnm't flip.
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[15:30:57] <robertmaxrees> part of your issue is you're using toggleClass()
[15:31:09] <Anthaas> It worked until I added a chain of 4 windows
[15:31:46] <robertmaxrees> so what's $('.flip-container').toggleClass('flip'); supposed to do here?
[15:31:46] <Anthaas> As I said login -> register -> login works, because 0deg, 180deg by toggling flip and setting register to -180 by default, and then back to the start, right?
[15:31:56] <robertmaxrees> and how does this flip[ plugin do its thing.
[15:32:05] <Anthaas> Its not a plugin, its css.
[15:32:16] <Anthaas> It toggles 180deg in Y rotation of the window
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> ah, via $('.login-window').css("transform", "rotateY(0deg);");?
[15:32:54] <Anthaas> No, via .flip-container.flip .flipper {
[15:32:54] <Anthaas>     transform: rotateY(180deg);
[15:32:54] <Anthaas> }
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:33:15] <taplar> i can't get the bug to happen in the fiddle
[15:33:22] <taplar> afaik
[15:33:24] <Anthaas> taplar, which fiddle did you click?
[15:33:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/
[15:33:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/1/ has the bug.
[15:33:47] <Anthaas> they are both bugged
[15:33:48] <Anthaas> One secnd
[15:33:58] <robertmaxrees> my gut wants to say that the hasClass check is part of the problem here.
[15:34:11] <taplar> i'm clicking forgot, login, forgot, login and it keeps flipping
[15:34:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that conditional seems to be the issue.
[15:34:35] <Anthaas> taplar, Thats not the bug - I made a mistake in the link you are clicking though
[15:34:46] <Anthaas> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/2/ << taplar
[15:34:50] <robertmaxrees> since toggleClass is properly triggering twice and on the second time it doesn't have the class.
[15:34:56] <Anthaas> Click forgot password? Then reset password. then confirm
[15:35:28] <taplar> ah
[15:40:08] <taplar> lol, that seems overly complicated
[15:40:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:40:49] <taplar> why not just perform the flip animation and then show whatever you need?  instead of making each piece have it's own rotation?
[15:41:19] <Anthaas> Is it not the transform that is performing the rotation animation?
[15:41:39] <taplar> you have transform for some of the 'windows'
[15:42:41] <Anthaas> So, I "flip" the window, thus rotating it around the Y axis by 180 degrees, meaning whatever is on the back needs to have the rotation of the window - 180deg by default.
[15:42:52] <Anthaas> As I said, this works, except for when the chain is an even number.
[15:43:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> because of that toggleClass and conditional./
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> toggleClass adds and then removes - when you get back to the login on an "even" rotation, your condition isn't met.
[15:43:40] <Anthaas> Hense the hack
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> what's the hack?
[15:43:58] <Anthaas> https://jsfiddle.net/vn870ars/1/
[15:44:05] <Anthaas> in the js for showLoginWindow
[15:44:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean the conditional?
[15:44:16] <robertmaxrees> that's where your problem is tho.
[15:44:26] <robertmaxrees> that's what I'm saying - the hack doesn't workj.
[15:44:39] <Anthaas> It does - except the animation isn't performed.
[15:44:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't work.
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:44:50] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[15:44:53] <Anthaas> The hack ensures that when the login page shows, the state of the rotations is as it was at the start.
[15:44:55] <robertmaxrees> relying on toggleClass only is a bad idea.  i'd explicitly add/remove classes in this case.
[15:45:02] <robertmaxrees> except it doesn't do that at all.
[15:45:04] <Anthaas> ok
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> because you don't meet the condition.
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> explicitly set classes and your issue should theoretically go away.
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[19:19:30] <robertmaxrees> heckuva week already and it's only monday.
