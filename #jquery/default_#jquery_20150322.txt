[00:02:43] <_entropy> can anyone help me with this -> http://img661.imageshack.us/img661/57/CAhVfq.jpg -> the last 2 buttons are embed, and for some reason the text is blank...
[00:02:53] <_entropy> i'm useing ZeroClipboard
[00:03:41] <_entropy> i tried getting the value of the buttons, but still invisible
[01:54:47] <Omar-> good morning
[01:59:21] <frank_o> Hiya Omar- !
[02:01:18] <Omar-> hi frank_o
[02:01:22] <Omar-> how r u bro
[02:13:57] <djQuery> i have tried hiding and disabling an input that is required but the page still won't submit
[02:16:45] <Omar-> djQuery any code to share?
[02:17:00] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/diwuve/1/edit
[02:17:52] <djQuery> Omar it is in a more complex page than this but this still shows it
[02:18:04] <djQuery> will be conditionally required
[02:18:26] <djQuery> gues I could just hid it and add / remove the required prop
[02:19:15] <Omar-> yea, remove required if you want to submit
[02:19:21] <_entropy> anyone here knowledgable with ZeroClipboard?
[02:19:49] <djQuery> ?ask@_entropy
[02:20:00] <djQuery> dang bots, wakeup
[02:20:22] <Omar-> djQuery .removeAttr("required") should do
[02:20:25] <Omar-> are you using jqm?
[02:20:34] <djQuery> omar yes

[02:21:04] <Meir`> !ask _entropy
[02:21:13] <Omar-> djQuery lovely :)
[02:21:17] <djQuery> Omar-, http://jsbin.com/tipper/
[02:21:19] <Meir`> hello Omar- :)
[02:21:21] <Meir`> !ask _entropy
[02:21:33] <Omar-> hi Meir`, how are you?
[02:21:44] <djQuery> !ask@_entropy
[02:21:51] <Meir`> good, except the fact it's sunday +_+
[02:22:04] <Meir`> i'm at work
[02:22:19] <Omar-> djQuery dont use .ready in jQM
[02:22:24] <Omar-> only in special cases
[02:23:09] <Meir`> djQuery, i remembered, it's:
[02:23:11] <djQuery> Omar-, what else am I supposed to use then?
[02:23:14] <Meir`> !ask @ _entropy
[02:23:14] <b-ot> _entropy: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:23:16] <Meir`> :D
[02:23:32] <_entropy> i'm using ZeroClipboard that uses an embed to a flash movie... when i css embed:hover {} it puts a black box over the top of an element - i want to use more than one clipboard button
[02:23:36] <Omar-> djQuery use `pagecreate` to attach events
[02:23:55] <Omar-> djQuery in that demo, what's the problem exactly?
[02:24:27] <djQuery> Meir`, its been awhile, so they changed ? to ! and spacing is important now
[02:25:19] <djQuery> Omar-, well when you end a shift you may need to start a new one but the endMiles is hidden but required
[02:25:40] <djQuery> Omar-, this means that you have to do a refresh for it to work again
[02:25:56] <djQuery> Omar-, I never close the page persay
[02:26:48] <frank_o> Hello! How come `request` isn't being run every 5 seconds despite the `setTimeout` call in `poll`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/0q66e0z6/
[02:26:50] <Meir`> _entropy, can you please set some fiddle?
[02:27:02] <_entropy> http://img673.imageshack.us/img673/7808/cAmgva.jpg
[02:27:18] <_entropy> embed hover is black background
[02:27:26] <_entropy> it will take a lot of work to put it on fiddle
[02:27:49] <Meir`> frank_o, i believe that "this" doesn't refer to the parent object
[02:28:21] <frank_o> Meir`: aah i see
[02:29:00] <frank_o> _entropy: you definitely should. this link gets mentioned here at least 10 times a day :-) http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[02:29:53] <Omar-> djQuery: jQM wise, there should be many changes in your code to comply with latest version 1.4.5
[02:30:11] <djQuery> Omar-, yeah probably
[02:30:36] <djQuery> I just upgraded it last week and haven't had a chance to read the docs yet
[02:30:54] <Omar-> djQuery for example, to redirect to another page use pagecontainerbeforechange
[02:30:56] <Omar-> not pageshow
[02:31:01] <frank_o> Meir`: any suggestions on how to refer to the parent object?
[02:31:20] <djQuery> I noticed they seemed to have moved a lot of stuff out of the data and into the classes where it should have been
[02:31:25] <Omar-> https://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/pagecontainerbeforechange/
[02:31:28] <Omar-> read this
[02:31:44] <Omar-> djQuery yea, many changes
[02:31:59] <djQuery> are you on that team?
[02:32:04] <Omar-> and this https://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/
[02:32:12] <Omar-> no, I just like it
[02:32:20] <Omar-> i mean the framework
[02:32:21] <frank_o> jqmtricks best blog ever =)
[02:32:39] <Omar-> frank_o thanks ;)
[02:33:16] <frank_o> djQuery: yeah he seems to know a lot more about jqm than many of its authors
[02:34:46] <frank_o> Meir`: sorry, it does appear to refer to the parent object, its just that it only gets run once whereas it should run infinitely
[02:34:50] <djQuery> Omar-, there are probably only 5 people using the tip tracker I don't even have a real site for it just use it directly in jsbin
[02:36:17] <Meir`> frank_o, perhaps i was wrong
[02:36:25] <Meir`> it was an assumption
[02:36:29] <djQuery> frank_o, http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/0q66e0z6/
[02:36:55] <djQuery> frank_o, no read it wrong
[02:37:37] <frank_o> sorry?
[02:40:03] <frank_o> looks like i just need setInterval..
[02:40:18] <frank_o> cheers fellas!
[02:40:20] <djQuery> frank_o, I wouldn't
[02:40:34] <djQuery> setInterval is evil
[02:41:40] <frank_o> hehe
[02:41:58] <djQuery> frank_o, what if someone is using it on a crappy 3g connection and it actualy takes longer to complete than 5 seconds
[02:42:25] <djQuery> frank_o, but then another one runs before the 1st is done
[02:42:30] <Omar-> d/c
[02:42:34] <frank_o> good point
[02:42:48] <frank_o> djQuery: explains why the original code didnt have setInterval either (http://railscasts.com/episodes/229-polling-for-changes)
[02:43:01] <frank_o> * http://railscasts.com/episodes/229-polling-for-changes-revised
[02:43:20] <Meir`> frank_o, u managed to solve?
[02:43:22] <Omar-> djQuery i'll take at your app when I finish my app ;)
[02:43:25] <djQuery> frank_o, what is it not doing for you? seems to work for me
[02:43:58] <djQuery> Omar-, wheres yours
[02:44:29] <Omar-> djQuery http://jsbin.com/retaji/
[02:44:34] <Omar-> this is stage 1
[02:44:40] <frank_o> djQuery: yep its all good. gonna stick to setTimeout, thanks
[02:44:51] <frank_o> Meir`: kinda :-)
[02:45:14] <Meir`> if you store "this" in some var, it will work with "setTimeout"
[02:45:15] <Omar-> stage 2: to integrate it with http://jsbin.com/vuvilo (double tap to enlarge and move image)
[02:45:39] <Meir`> http://jsfiddle.net/0q66e0z6/3/
[02:45:44] <Meir`> frank_o ^ check this
[02:46:45] <djQuery> Meir`, it was working the other way as well
[02:47:38] <frank_o> yep
[02:47:41] <frank_o> im all good, thanks guys
[02:47:42] <Meir`> lol
[02:47:42] <djQuery> frank_o, you just need to do a setTimeout in whatever code is completed when a poll happens
[02:47:51] <Meir`> i just noticed the "every 5 seconds" now
[02:48:02] <Meir`> thought he said "after 5 seconds"
[02:48:37] <djQuery> Omar-, WTF Seized maxi pads 35 times more radioactive than limit
[02:49:21] <Omar-> djQuery: hmmm..what do you mean?
[02:49:55] <djQuery> Omar-, just using you reddit reader with the WTF tag
[02:50:44] <_entropy> question... how do you change the value of a button that is embed?
[02:50:55] <_entropy> for some reason... it's blank
[02:51:00] <_entropy> or invisible
[02:51:07] <Omar-> djQuery oh ok, sorry didnt get it
[02:51:16] <Omar-> hot or normal?
[02:51:24] <Omar-> normal = new
[02:51:28] <Omar-> when hot isn't checked
[02:51:41] <frank_o> djQuery: gotcha!
[02:51:49] <djQuery> Omar-, didn't change it
[02:51:58] <djQuery> so whatever the default is
[02:52:09] <Omar-> djQuery maybe i should integrate a search tool too
[02:53:09] <Omar-> found it
[02:55:06] <Omar-> _entropy $("btn").val("value")
[02:55:33] <Omar-> i have to go now
[02:55:42] <djQuery> Omar-, later
[02:55:42] <Omar-> talk to you later
[03:26:37] <_entropy> how do i make 2 seperate background-images for an embed?
[03:28:26] <frank_o> _entropy: could you set up a live testcase please?
[03:29:08] <frank_o> for 2 separate background images, maybe you can use `:before` and `:after` pseudo selectors in CSS?
[03:48:01] <_entropy> frank_o query please
[04:35:59] <murr4y_> Question for any users of the Waypoints plugin. I want some graphs to render before the user scrolls down to them so I set offset to '100%'. That's fine unless I also set continuous: false. Now, if I "jump" past some of the charts they don't render which is fine, but as I scroll back up they don't render either, not until they go off the screen.
[04:36:24] <murr4y_> I guess I want a 'top-in-view' offset, but it doesn't exist?
[05:21:43] <krambiorix> hi, how can i catch a window open event?
[05:23:47] <AssassinsMod> window open lika a popup?
[05:26:30] <dragon_boy> var derp = parseFloat($('.total').text().replace(/[^\d.-]/g,'')); removes the dollar sign and parses the value as float, but then I can't use something like addClass on derp because it's not a jquery object. How do I use jquery methods on derp?
[05:29:20] <krambiorix> AssassinsMod, nope, like in open the browser
[05:29:52] <dragon_boy> krambiorix: halp me
[05:30:25] <krambiorix> $(derp).dosomething
[05:30:31] <krambiorix> but derp is a float
[05:30:59] <AssassinsMod> krambiorix: so you want to trigger an action when there's a redirection? like an <a> or a window.location = "..."
[05:31:40] <krambiorix> AssassinsMod, nope, i want , when the user opens its browser to get that event
[05:32:34] <dragon_boy> krambiorix: derp is a variable
[05:32:46] <_entropy> can someone help me fix this: http://jsfiddle.net/o831eetk/2/
[05:33:06] <_entropy> i'm trying to get ZeroClipboard to work
[05:34:04] <AssassinsMod> krambiorix: if you want to trigger something as soon as the page is loaded it's $(window).load
[05:34:25] <AssassinsMod> if you want to wait for the dom to be loaded you say $(document).ready
[05:34:26] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I'm trying to extract a bit of html which includes some in line javascript commented out.  I'm using .text() and CSS white-space: pre; to retain line breaks.. However there's a huge space where the commented out javascript is. Does anyone know how this can be avoided? Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/msyt3zj9/
[05:34:30] <AssassinsMod> otherwise i didn't understand
[05:35:12] <krambiorix> AssassinsMod, well, i want to send an ajax request when the user re-opens the browser and the page loads. With that request i want to check if the user is still authenticated
[05:35:12] <AssassinsMod> CocoStorm: you don't need the space wrap i think
[05:36:00] <CocoStorm> Okay but how do I retain the <br/> so that the line breaks just before 'etc'
[05:36:14] <CocoStorm> and of course get rid of the leading white space
[05:36:56] <AssassinsMod> if all you have to do is a copy you could get the html from the first
[05:37:07] <AssassinsMod> if you have to parse the content for other purposes it might need some work
[05:37:32] <CocoStorm> AssassinsMod: what do you mean do a copy?
[05:37:39] <CocoStorm> I need to parse it
[05:37:51] <CocoStorm> as in, it needs to be done somehow using js or jquery
[05:40:11] <AssassinsMod> CocoStorm: i mean that if you have to show it in an element like you're doing now
[05:40:22] <AssassinsMod> you could just do: $("#testing-stuff").html()
[05:40:23] <CocoStorm> oh I see, yeah I do
[05:40:55] <AssassinsMod> that way you get the <br> as a tag and re-add that in the new element
[05:41:33] <AssassinsMod> otherwise if you have to show it in console you would have to replace the <br> with an escape character like \n
[05:42:12] <CocoStorm> AssassinsMod: that works, but for some reason when I add that to my site it breaks.  I'm guessing it could be to do with the fact that the inline javascript has document.write()
[05:42:49] <CocoStorm> (the site breaks not the element)
[05:43:08] <AssassinsMod> idk, i should see
[05:45:00] <AssassinsMod> i mean, i need to see how it breaks to know what happens
[05:46:52] <CocoStorm> ahh I see yeah I suppose
[05:47:01] <CocoStorm> hmm it's on my work laptop so I'll have to come back
[05:47:19] <CocoStorm> but basically the navigation bar disappears and some other icons
[05:47:26] <AssassinsMod> well, you can simply host js scripts and css files to something like gist
[05:47:30] <AssassinsMod> and load them through jsfiddle
[05:47:40] <AssassinsMod> copy&paste the body and it's done
[05:47:55] <CocoStorm> oh yeah that sounds good actually
[05:47:58] <CocoStorm> didn't think of that
[05:49:08] <AssassinsMod> these tools come handy
[05:50:28] <_entropy> anyone here know about ZeroClipboard?
[05:50:43] <_entropy> http://jsfiddle.net/o831eetk/4/ -> doesn't work
[05:50:53] <AssassinsMod> _entropy, i was checking it ^ ^
[05:54:56] <anli_> Off topic: Can I put onclick on a <a>-tag? http://jsfiddle.net/ttb6ccgo/23/
[05:57:07] <AssassinsMod> anli_: in jsfillde to do something like that you should set in frameworks & extensions the wrap-mode to "No wrap - in <head>"
[05:57:20] <AssassinsMod> that way jsfiddle loads the javascript as if it was placed in head and it works fine
[05:57:23] <anli_> Oh, yeah :)
[05:57:25] <AssassinsMod> http://jsfiddle.net/ttb6ccgo/25/
[05:57:36] <anli_> Can I unselect jQuery?
[05:57:40] <AssassinsMod> yep
[05:58:11] <AssassinsMod> No-Library (pureJS)
[05:58:17] <AssassinsMod> http://jsfiddle.net/ttb6ccgo/26/
[05:58:23] <anli_> Ah, yeha
[05:58:26] <anli_> yeah
[05:58:26] <anli_> thx
[05:59:31] <AssassinsMod> see you later guys
[07:32:35] <Meir`> i have a select box with a list, and u want to trigger an "change" event on every new selection
[07:32:47] <Meir`> even if the selected option hasn't really changed
[07:33:02] <Meir`> tried to play with "click" event, but no success
[07:33:11] <Meir`> and  want*
[07:33:15] <Meir`> and i want **
[07:34:20] <AssassinsMod> wait
[07:34:23] <AssassinsMod> let me search for that
[07:35:36] <AssassinsMod> $("myList").change(function(){ alert(this.value); });
[07:36:17] <AssassinsMod> this triggers every time the selected elements changes
[07:36:26] <AssassinsMod> and get's the selection value with "this.value"
[07:37:43] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, but as i said, i want it to trigger even if the selected option hasn't changed
[07:38:20] <Meir`> that means that every time the user opens the option list and clicks on some option
[07:38:44] <AssassinsMod> well the .click would work
[07:38:49] <AssassinsMod> wouldn't
[07:40:52] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, the click event will bind to a <select>, but i can't bind it to an <option> element
[07:43:52] <AssassinsMod> Meir`, i have an idea, let me test it a bit
[07:46:12] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, this is pretty similar to my needs: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24018064/jquery-chosen-how-to-onclick-for-a-special-option
[07:46:28] <Meir`> except the fact the OP used multiple select box
[07:46:35] <Meir`> and i need the regular
[07:49:10] <AssassinsMod> Meir`, this is not very clean but it might do the trick http://jsfiddle.net/h2491c4a/1/
[07:50:22] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, when should it alert?
[07:50:35] <AssassinsMod> on mouseleave
[07:50:52] <AssassinsMod> basically when it click on any element, the select closes and the mouse "leaves" the element
[07:51:05] <Meir`> well it never alerts for me
[07:51:15] <AssassinsMod> i'm a damn retard
[07:51:23] <AssassinsMod> you should remove the .onmouseenter
[07:52:13] <Meir`> that makes it quite impossible to select :|
[07:52:24] <AssassinsMod> http://jsfiddle.net/h2491c4a/3/
[07:52:55] <AssassinsMod> but idk it meets what you need
[07:53:01] <AssassinsMod> i dont think*
[07:53:07] <AssassinsMod> today i'm pretty dislessic
[07:53:08] <Meir`> nope
[07:53:27] <Meir`> i think that the <option> rendering in browsers is a bit buggy
[07:53:47] <Meir`> probably i'll choose some other way to list my items
[07:54:06] <Meir`> i just want the last item to be "add new" and to open a dialog
[07:54:17] <Meir`> the problem is after adding one new item
[07:54:28] <Meir`> the select box remains on "add new"
[07:54:36] <AssassinsMod> could you do a jsfiddle of the page?
[07:54:39] <Meir`> and if the user clicks again, nothing will happen
[07:54:47] <Meir`> sure. sec
[07:58:34] <AssassinsMod> Meir`, what about making a dropdown like this? http://jsfiddle.net/h2491c4a/4/
[08:09:26] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, i thought of that
[08:09:46] <Meir`> but this is can confuse the user a bit
[08:09:52] <Meir`> anyway, sorry for the delay
[08:09:56] <AssassinsMod> np
[08:10:05] <Meir`> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/
[08:10:08] <Meir`> here's a demo
[08:10:34] <Meir`> when you choose "Add new item..." at the first time, it adds
[08:10:58] <Meir`> but if you wish to add more, you have to select some other option, and then to re-select  "Add new item..."
[08:11:54] <Meir`> i'm considering to create a button for the "add new"
[08:12:09] <AssassinsMod> mh...
[08:12:16] <gobbie> do you just want to make the new item the item that is selected?
[08:12:16] <Meir`> that's the simplest way
[08:12:39] <Meir`> gobbie, not necessarily
[08:12:52] <gobbie> ohh i get it
[08:12:58] <gobbie> you cant click it again because it is already selected
[08:13:04] <Meir`> yeah
[08:13:12] <Meir`> although i DO open the option list
[08:13:18] <Meir`> and i DO click again the "add new"
[08:13:24] <Meir`> it can't trigger any event
[08:13:45] <Meir`> maybe playing with mouse events
[08:13:54] <Meir`> but it's way too tricky for my needs
[08:13:56] <gobbie> ok so use ‘click’ event
[08:14:15] <Meir`> doesn't work with <option> element, when in single mode
[08:14:21] <gobbie> instead of an on change event, bind a click event to that one <select>
[08:14:22] <Meir`> tried already
[08:14:31] <gobbie> interesting
[08:14:41] <gobbie> one sec let me play with it
[08:14:44] <Meir`> if i bind to "select" it will trigger even when i simply open the option list
[08:15:30] <AssassinsMod> the problem with the click listener is that it trigs even when you just open the list
[08:15:39] <Meir`> indeed
[08:15:47] <gobbie> did you do a event.stopPropagation()
[08:15:52] <gobbie> might not work, but wortha  shot
[08:17:03] <Meir`> gobbie, how should it help?
[08:17:25] <Meir`> actually, i placed here my question more out of curiosity
[08:17:47] <Meir`> i'm not forced to use a select option in order to add new item
[08:18:04] <AssassinsMod> maybe i solved
[08:18:46] <AssassinsMod> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/2/
[08:18:50] <AssassinsMod> it's a bit rough
[08:19:10] <AssassinsMod> if you manage to make it work nicely let me know
[08:19:43] <Meir`> you can't select a new item this way
[08:20:12] <AssassinsMod> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/3/
[08:20:16] <AssassinsMod> oh
[08:20:39] <Meir`> heh
[08:20:52] <AssassinsMod> no
[08:20:52] <Meir`> nothing happens while clicking Add new item...
[08:21:01] <AssassinsMod> it works for me ..
[08:21:06] <Omar-> is it advisable to call same ajax function from within it with different arguments of "error"? http://www.codeshare.io/n1BJj
[08:21:11] <Meir`> oh, sorry
[08:21:29] <AssassinsMod> Meir`, update 3 http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/3/
[08:21:33] <AssassinsMod> seems to be working fine
[08:21:37] <AssassinsMod> but it's ugly
[08:21:38] <Meir`> AssassinsMod, but it workds even if not clicking
[08:21:42] <Meir`> only by hovering
[08:21:54] <AssassinsMod> ..
[08:21:55] <AssassinsMod> w8
[08:22:55] <AssassinsMod> ... are you sure?
[08:23:22] <Meir`> in the first you won't see it
[08:23:25] <Meir`> try to add few
[08:23:45] <Meir`> hover on "Add" and then close the list
[08:23:49] <Meir`> and re-open it
[08:23:56] <Meir`> you'll see a new item
[08:25:04] <Meir`> oh. lol. even when losing focus from the select box
[08:25:08] <Meir`> and then re focusing
[08:25:38] <gobbie> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/
[08:26:07] <gobbie> adds them without selecting the new option button
[08:26:10] <Meir`> gobbie, you didn't press "Update" ;)
[08:26:19] <gobbie> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/4/
[08:26:21] <gobbie> lol sry
[08:26:54] <gobbie>  nvm
[08:26:56] <Meir`> gobbie, that was my first attempt
[08:26:57] <gobbie> lol
[08:27:01] <AssassinsMod> same here
[08:27:03] <Meir`> but thank you :)
[08:27:19] <Meir`> it's a nice idea
[08:27:19] <AssassinsMod> never got so many problems from a damn dropdown menu
[08:27:29] <Meir`> that "add new item..." won't be really selectable
[08:27:41] <gobbie> http://jsfiddle.net/bg6p2xd8/5/
[08:28:07] <gobbie> there.. now you can select any of them except new ..if you click new it adds on and selects the top option..
[08:28:11] <Meir`> instead of  $('#mySelect').val(0);
[08:28:18] <Meir`> i would store the last selected
[08:28:30] <Meir`> and re-select it after the user pressed "Add new"
[08:28:35] <gobbie> yea like $(‘’option:last”)
[08:28:46] <gobbie> oic yea that would work too
[08:28:57] <gobbie> the :last would select the new option you jsut created
[08:29:02] <Meir`> that's preferred
[08:29:28] <Meir`> it's not what i meant
[08:29:39] <Meir`> but it's the same prinicpal :)
[08:29:55] <Meir`> all about making it reasonable to the user
[08:30:03] <gobbie> right
[08:30:33] <Meir`> Omar-, it seems okay
[08:34:38] <AssassinsMod> Meir`, i found out that with jquery 1.9.1 if you put val('0') it goes to the first item of the array
[08:34:54] <AssassinsMod> but with jquery 2.1.0 it goes to a null line
[08:35:27] <for1096> `this.oldblock ? this.oldblock : ""`, is it exactly the same as `this.oldblock || ""`?
[08:35:29] <for1096> in jQuery 1.0.4, show() use `this.style.display = this.oldblock ? this.oldblock : "";`, while hide() use `this.oldblock = this.oldblock || jQuery.css(this,"display");`, so I'm confused...
[08:35:40] <for1096> I think if it is written by the same person, why these 2 places use different style..
[08:35:48] <AssassinsMod> depends on what this.oldblock returns
[08:36:05] <AssassinsMod> if it's a simple var, it should
[08:40:41] <for1096> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4449076fb3e722c3580f the code's here, line 1189 and 1195
[08:41:06] <for1096> AssassinsMod: Thanks! I thought they are the same, but I'm not so sure now..
[08:44:06] <AssassinsMod> it depends on how js manages the vars to be used as conditions
[08:45:34] <AssassinsMod> for1096, in many languages if i say: string t = "123; if (t) { ... } would be syntattically wrong
[09:15:05] <bongjovi> I'm using $.get to get pages via AJAX and then .replaceWith() to update the container div... is there an easy way to get the page title?
[09:15:18] <bongjovi> as if the page is loaded via ajax it omits the <head> content
[09:18:30] <gobbie> document.title = "This is the new page title.";
[09:19:34] <bongjovi> But that will get the current title, not the page that I'm loading via ajax
[09:19:58] <bongjovi> Going to put a data-title attr on each page container div
[09:20:02] <bongjovi> and update it using that
[09:20:05] <gobbie> exactly
[09:21:12] <Meir`> bongjovi, i think you can also use .find() for finding the title
[09:22:15] <Meir`> sorry, .filter() is the correct one
[09:22:43] <Meir`> $.parseHTML(responesAJAX).filter('title').text();
[09:23:04] <Meir`> respondedAJAX * but that's only a forced name anyway ;)
[09:23:14] <bongjovi> Thanks Meir`, that was the solution I found.. but in this case the head is omitted
[09:23:26] <bongjovi> So would that still find it?
[09:23:33] <Meir`> you use .load() ?
[09:23:57] <bongjovi> $.get
[09:23:59] <Meir`> best approach is to inspect the network section in developer tools
[09:24:20] <Meir`> the "Response" tab will show you the exact responded data
[09:24:53] <bongjovi> Yeah for sure, it's just the HTML I requested, so the head is omitted when loading via AJAX
[09:25:04] <djam90> Hey. How can I add a different easing method to this? I looked at the docs but can't see how I'd add it. http://jsfiddle.net/jcbwux7r/6/
[09:25:41] <bongjovi> Either way, seems to be fine that I just include the page title as a data attribute and grab that after $.get has succeeded
[09:25:46] <Meir`> bongjovi, so you indeed have to use some custom tag
[09:26:12] <bongjovi> Cool, thanks. :)
[09:26:45] <Meir`> djam90, i couldn't understad your question
[09:27:05] <djam90> Meir`, how do I change the animation easing, like ease-out, ease-in, swing, etc
[09:27:39] <Meir`> you use ".animate()" with "scrollTop"
[09:27:53] <Meir`> so it scrolls to the top with delay of 900 ms
[09:28:24] <djam90> Meir`, can't you add easing, so it sort of bounces
[09:34:42] <gobbie> djam90 do you have jquery ui installed
[09:34:49] <djam90> yes
[09:35:03] <gobbie> hmm ok so you have access to the additional easings
[09:35:14] <gobbie> http://jsfiddle.net/jcbwux7r/9/
[09:35:37] <gobbie> that shows swing added to the easing param.. with jquery ui you can get addition easings ..
[09:35:52] <djam90> OHHHHHHHH
[09:36:01] <gobbie> http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[09:36:01] <djam90> need to include jqUK and they work
[09:36:02] <djam90> haha
[09:36:14] <gobbie> 8)
[09:36:14] <djam90> yeah i saw that but forgot to include jqUI in project
[09:36:15] <djam90> thanks!
[09:36:19] <gobbie> np
[10:16:45] <rochadt> hm
[11:05:27] * alluringme shruggs!
[11:12:52] <Psychiatrist> Guys, if I would want to change a block of text using $(this).replaceWith() with another block of text but I want it to look different -- is there any way I could add CSS properties to it in JQuery?
[11:15:53] <alluringme> yes
[11:16:04] <alluringme> Psychiatrist, it can be done
[11:16:31] <alluringme> e.g. $("p").css("background-color");
[11:16:41] <Psychiatrist> oh, cheers, wow
[11:16:43] <alluringme> Generalized: css("propertyname","value");
[11:16:46] <alluringme> Cheers
[11:16:55] <Psychiatrist> Thanks Alluringme!
[11:17:06] <alluringme> Yw. ;)
[11:40:31] <arthurvr> Hey guys!
[11:42:43] <AssassinsMod_> what's up?
[11:49:12] <alluringme> arthurvr, hey; all is sexy! Hope you are having fun too.
[11:49:42] <arthurvr> All goin’ well. Hi AssassinsMod, Hi alluringme!
[13:19:26] <AssassinsMod> what ide do you guys use?
[13:20:12] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: I’m totally Vim only :D
[13:20:57] <AssassinsMod> D:
[13:21:01] <AssassinsMod> you've got courage
[13:21:54] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: And productivity :D Though I hate that kind of guys yelling everywhere that everybody should learn vi.
[13:22:18] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: You should try everything for a decent time and see what you like
[13:22:29] <arthurvr> (and appear to be productive with)
[13:22:48] <AssassinsMod> i use vim, but not for relatively complex projects..
[13:23:00] <arthurvr> Just interested, why?
[13:23:25] <AssassinsMod> actually it's very comfortable if you get handy with the commands
[13:23:41] <arthurvr> Yeah of course :D
[13:23:45] <AssassinsMod> but some autocompletation never hurts
[13:24:27] <arthurvr> Vim can perfectly autocomplete :)
[13:25:16] <AssassinsMod> what, really?
[13:25:57] <arthurvr> I used https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe for a while, but I feel like I’m faster without autocompletion.
[13:26:47] <AssassinsMod> I had no idea vim could have plugins
[13:27:02] <arthurvr> REALLY?
[13:27:13] <arthurvr> go try it out man :D
[13:28:02] <arthurvr> Yeah then I can imagine you feel like you want an ide :D
[13:28:32] <AssassinsMod> yep
[13:28:44] <AssassinsMod> until now all vim did was some syntax highlight
[13:31:54] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: It’s a whole new world that opens.
[13:32:00] <arthurvr> You never wanted things like a file tree or so? :)) http://gyazo.com/7762d79743f76aae479300868ea5e67a
[13:34:02] <AssassinsMod> wait
[13:34:22] <AssassinsMod> the only thing that's vim there is the window title
[13:34:51] <arthurvr> It’s totally vim man :D
[13:37:00] <willharrison> anyone know why this clone isn't working?  I am getting false on the console log http://laravel.io/bin/6Lzev
[13:37:05] <AssassinsMod> how many years of work would it take to take vim to a good state?
[13:37:30] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: You mean to have it setup in a way you like it or to learn the editor itself?
[13:37:36] <AssassinsMod> willharrison, truncated page?
[13:37:55] <willharrison> AssassinsMod what do you mean?
[13:37:58] <AssassinsMod> arthurvr, to set it good
[13:38:21] <willharrison> AssassinsMod depends on what you're using vim for
[13:38:28] <AssassinsMod> willharrison, nevermind
[13:38:30] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: Not long. There are many people sharing their nice setup and you can just use it, for free :D
[13:38:35] <arthurvr> Just modify it with your needs.
[13:38:54] <arthurvr> Search for dotfiles on github and you’ll find hunderds of vim setups :))
[13:39:20] <willharrison> arthurvr if that is your vim setup, you should check out airline
[13:39:53] <arthurvr> willharrison: I used airline for years but not anymore.
[13:39:58] <willharrison> ah ok
[13:40:01] <arthurvr> It takes a little to much spaces for what it does, IMHO.
[13:40:28] <arthurvr> Not like space, attention. I like to be focussed on code, not on side stuff.
[13:40:35] <willharrison> yeah, it is mainly for looks lol
[13:40:43] <willharrison> I do like how it shows which git branch I am on tho
[13:41:04] <willharrison> and file type etc
[13:41:20] <arthurvr> I’m kinda like ”I know what file I opened, man.”
[13:41:32] <willharrison> true
[13:42:08] <arthurvr> And the git branch is right in my bash prompt anyways so I don’t really feel like it adds much value.
[13:42:41] <arthurvr> Anyways, all just opinions. You should set it up the way you like it.
[13:42:51] <willharrison> yeah, tbh I don't do much outside vim these days
[13:43:10] <willharrison> I keep a terminal up for gulp and a standalone server if I am using one
[13:43:15] <willharrison> but that's about it
[13:43:24] <arthurvr> I spend like all my time in my terminal and vim.
[13:43:46] <arthurvr> It’s impressive when developing (front-end) webapps, I don’t open my browser that much.
[13:44:05] <willharrison> that's a good way to be
[13:44:19] <arthurvr> Yeah of course!
[13:44:22] <willharrison> do you know what might be messing up my clone?
[13:44:30] <willharrison> http://laravel.io/bin/6Lzev
[13:44:44] <arthurvr> lemme take a look.
[13:44:47] <willharrison> thanks
[13:45:04] <AssassinsMod> willharrison, god worked 6 days, but in the 7th he invented jsfiddle <3
[13:45:11] <arthurvr> ^
[13:45:14] <arthurvr> haha :D
[13:45:25] <willharrison> lol sorry, I should have put it on there
[13:45:34] <willharrison> I didn't think about it, don't do much front end
[13:46:30] <arthurvr> You sure jQuery is loaded and your blade template is rendering correctly and stuff?
[13:46:38] <willharrison> yeah
[13:46:44] <willharrison> everything else works fine
[13:46:52] <willharrison> and I was cloning it from other posts fine
[13:46:56] <arthurvr> Does it output anything in the console?
[13:47:03] <willharrison> false
[13:47:08] <willharrison> as in it outputs false
[13:47:22] <willharrison> for the console.log
[13:47:23] <willharrison> that is all tho
[13:48:59] <arthurvr> willharrison: Could you try to modify this fiddle till it breaks? http://jsfiddle.net/9gda14q8/
[13:49:27] <willharrison> k
[13:49:52] <arthurvr> Oh I’ve got it.
[13:50:12] <arthurvr> The thing is that, as you probably know, ids are unique to one element.
[13:50:37] <willharrison> yeah
[13:51:05] <arthurvr> I’m sure it’s explained on the api docs, gotta leave :(
[13:51:13] <arthurvr> `api clone @ willharrison
[13:51:13] <b-ot> willharrison: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[13:51:29] <willharrison> arthurvr thanks
[13:53:03] <willharrison> b-ot I set to true and I have removed the id attr after cloning but I still get false
[13:53:32] <arthurvr> b-ot is our robot :D
[13:53:43] <willharrison> oh my bad lol
[13:54:44] <arthurvr> willharrison: this is the note on the api docs you’re search for: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/clone.xml#L73
[13:54:51] <arthurvr> Now really gotta leave :)
[13:55:05] <willharrison> ok thanks
[13:55:55] <willharrison> arthurvr type -_-
[13:56:00] <willharrison> typo*
[13:56:28] <arthurvr> where?
[13:56:51] <willharrison> http://laravel.io/bin/6Lzev#1,7
[13:56:54] <willharrison> line 7
[13:57:05] <arthurvr> yup yup yup
[13:57:07] <arthurvr> :D
[13:57:15] <arthurvr> Tho still fixup the unique-id problem.
[13:57:18] <willharrison> 3rd time this weekend I've spent an hour on a typo
[13:57:20] <arthurvr> You will face it now or later.
[13:57:22] <willharrison> yeah, I set it to class
[13:57:33] <willharrison> I had it as class first and thought that might be causing it so I tried id
[14:49:18] <AssassinsMod> arthurvr, do i need vim or gvim?

[21:10:58] <theotherstupidgu> hi, is there a plugin to provide a similar interaction for the movable pad in the http://d3js.org/ website?
[21:12:38] <theotherstupidgu> hello, is there a plugin to provide a similar interaction with the movable pad at http://d3js.org/ website?
[21:25:56] <limbera> i have a page that has some graphical elements on it
[21:26:10] <limbera> there are 4 bar charts
[21:26:23] <limbera> and when i click a button i want to display the information in the bar chart as a table
[21:26:38] <limbera> i can think of a messy way to do it with on click handlers and hiding the bar chart and unhiding the table
[21:26:44] <limbera> but is there a cleaner way to do what i want?
[21:38:12] <ProofTechnique> theotherstupidgu: It looks like they use this: https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin
[21:40:05] <ProofTechnique> limbera: If you've got your data in a nice format like JSON, you could define different rendering methods.
[21:41:19] <limbera> ProofTechnique: i do have it all in JSON, can you elaborate so i can do some googling and work this out?
[21:42:17] <ProofTechnique> Okay. This link gives an example of rendering bar charts with D3.js: http://codepen.io/superpikar/pen/xCeiu
[21:42:52] <ProofTechnique> And this gives an example of rendering a table from JSON: http://jsfiddle.net/mjaric/sEwM6/
[21:43:18] <ProofTechnique> Though there are a bunch of plugins on Github that do that, as well.
[21:43:35] <ProofTechnique> D3 is definitely what you should use for data visualization, though. It's pretty awesome. :)
[21:44:02] <ProofTechnique> As an example of such a plugin, there's http://www.dynatable.com
[21:44:33] <limbera> yeah my charts are in d3 :)
