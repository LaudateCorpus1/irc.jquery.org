[08:41:33] <ExeciN> I'm trying to make a new div and move some elements inside, this is how I'm doing it: $("#content").append("<div></div>"); $("#content div:last-child").addClass("col-sm-3"); $("#content div.col-sm3").append("#content div.list-group").remove();
[08:42:51] <ExeciN> the new div is created and it has the desired class but the elements aren't moved inside
[08:43:56] <ExeciN> *the .remove() bit at the end is just a paste mistake on irc
[08:45:42] <ExeciN> what am I doing wrong?
[08:49:48] <Uhkis> 1) not pasting a jsfiddle link from www.jsfiddle.net
[09:06:46] <codecutter> how can i get the key/value of this by index (instead of key) https://pastebin.com/k6rUtkfF
[09:07:02] <codecutter> e.g. how do i get the first 2 key/val pair?
[11:53:49] <kristhian> question how do i add some if statement with this script
[11:53:50] <kristhian> https://pastebin.com/3kJ9tUGt
[11:54:36] <kristhian> like if the first fadeOut will only disappear if the 2nd fadeOut appears, til it gets to the last fadeIn
[12:54:19] <ashzade> Hello everyone. I need a bit of help with jquery binding multiple times on elements after ajax events. https://jsfiddle.net/f89f9wgw/4/ After an ajax event, I get multiple alerts for this code.
[13:01:32] <Uhkis> ashzade: you have multiple .form-checkboxes on your page
[13:02:06] <ashzade> Uhkis: I do but it doesn't seem to be an issue on DOM load. Only after ajax events.
[13:02:24] <ashzade> and I'd like the code to affect all the .form-checkboxes
[13:02:24] <Uhkis> ashzade: that's when the binding happens according to your code
[13:03:48] <Uhkis> ashzade: maybe show the html after the ajax?
[13:04:20] <ashzade> It's a massive page :/ I can say that the html for those checkboxes does not change though
[13:04:39] <Uhkis> yeah, drupal's html isn't exactly tidy
[13:04:47] <ashzade> That's putting it lightly
[13:05:10] <ashzade> I'm thinking of removing the binding and adding it back after ajax, but that seems messy
[13:05:53] <Uhkis> have you tried $('body') as selector?
[13:06:39] <ashzade> instead of document? I can try. I read that document is the way to go to make it work with elements added after dom load
[13:07:23] <ashzade> $('body') still displays the alert 3 times after ajax
[13:08:50] <Uhkis> anything that's there on the parent level on page load works as a selecotr
[13:08:53] <Uhkis> selector too
[14:23:56] <pihpah> $.ajax({url: relative_path}); works fine for browsers on Linux while on Windows relative URLs are being prefixed with whatever URL path is in the browser address bar. Wtf?
[14:27:34] <shoky_> urls are always prefixed.. with domain name, and path etc.. you never ask the server for a relative url
[14:28:00] <shoky_> maybe you're loadig directly from the filesystem?
[14:31:30] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[14:31:58] <randymarsh9> can someone tell me why the top example works but i can't do the same thing using the bottom example?
[14:32:01] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/4edq4nsL/1/
[14:32:21] <randymarsh9> if i do the second example it tells me too much recursion
[14:33:48] <shoky_> randymarsh9: handler()  calls the handler function right away,  and evaluates to whatever handler() returns.. you're doing a recursive call to itself, with no stopping condition :P
[14:35:16] <shoky_> $("#selector").off('click', handler());   is the same as:      var whateverHandlerReturned = handler();   $("#selector").off('click', whateverHandlerReturned);
[14:35:29] <shoky_> so it calls the function right away.
[14:36:00] <shoky_> you don't want it to be called now, you want to set it as an event handler, and have it be called by jquery later, when the event happens
[14:36:15] <randymarsh9> exactly
[14:36:56] <randymarsh9> i'm trying to set it to an event handler but i want to define the function someplace outside my code
[14:37:25] <randymarsh9> i know how to define it all inside the same block but my code is getting really messy
[14:37:39] <randymarsh9> so i was trying to make it look more like example 2...
[14:38:25] <randymarsh9> still not sure how this is supposed to look
[14:50:27] <randymarsh9> nvm, i need to remove the parenthesis
[14:50:28] <randymarsh9> thx
[15:06:35] <z1haze> what would be the 'proper' way to detect the way a form was submitted via $form.submit(function(.. ?
[15:12:04] <z1haze> or is it even possible?
[15:22:20] <poboy> $( "#target" ).submit(function( event ) {
[15:22:20] <poboy>   alert( "Handler for .submit() called." );
[15:22:21] <poboy>   event.preventDefault();
[15:22:22] <poboy> });
[15:22:41] <poboy> something like that?
[15:27:44] <z1haze> no
[15:28:08] <z1haze> i need to be able (using the .submit handler) to determine if the form was submitted via just hitting enter, or clicking a button
[15:28:23] <z1haze> i should say id like to, i guess i dont have to
[15:28:37] <z1haze> because .click events on the form submit would also fire a .submit event too
[15:29:47] <z1haze> cause if i use a click event, then i gotta go fetch the validator and validate the form, where as if i stick with .submit, that event is only triggered if validation passes
[16:02:02] <shoky_> why would you use listen for clicks?
[16:02:10] <shoky_> -use
[16:04:02] <z1haze> kinda weird to explain but like.. the way this software works when you hit a page, your state is kinda frozen in time
[16:04:24] <z1haze> so when you click a link, or fill out a form etc, if it posts back to the server, the server listens for the 'action' and determines which flow to take
[16:04:37] <z1haze> its incredibly weird to explain without seeing it
[16:04:42] <z1haze> ill get a picture
[16:11:13] <z1haze> shoky_, https://www.dropbox.com/s/gueq908p9vczblu/pipeline.PNG?dl=0
[16:14:39] <z1haze> and each of those 'send' 'login' 'register' are actions on the page, sent through with whatever form action was used
[16:15:15] <z1haze> so i need to get the button that was used to submit the form, and if it was submitted with the keyboard, i need to get the default action of that form
[16:34:48] <shoky_> lol.. if that picture was supposed to make anything clearer.. failed bigtime :P
[16:35:53] <z1haze> heh
[16:35:58] <z1haze> yea, it was.
[16:36:07] <z1haze> you see the 3 lines that are labeled, send, login, etc
[16:36:49] <z1haze> those are referred to as the 'triggered' action of the page.. the system pulls that out of the form button that was used to submit the form
[16:37:24] <z1haze> the point I am making is that when using ajax, I need to find a way to send that data through, because apparently when using ajax to do this, to server doesnt decypher correctly the path
[16:37:55] <z1haze> If I know the action specifically I just append a route parameter  to the data, but I'm trying to make this reusable
[16:41:46] <shoky_> uhm you didn't even mention ajax until now. sorry still no idea what you're actually doing or what the problem is, and i gotta make me some food ;p
[16:44:15] <z1haze> I didnt think it was relevant sorry!
[16:50:53] <z1haze> so shoky_ how do you get the 'submitted action' from the .submit event
