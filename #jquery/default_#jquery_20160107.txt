[00:54:25] <hellyeah> hey anyone around?
[02:23:19] <hellyeah> hey anyone ardound?
[02:33:54] <anli> How does this page update when the window is resized? http://viewportsizes.com/mine/
[02:34:09] <anli> Oh, found it
[02:34:11] <anli> doh
[03:37:55] <dan2k3k4> Anyone know much about bxSlider
[03:39:04] <dan2k3k4> Wondering how I can set a div (outside of slider) with a value from current slides div (a data-id attribute on one element inside slide) - works fine for                     onSlideBefore: function ($slideElement, oldIndex, newIndex) {
[03:39:04] <dan2k3k4>  - but have not been able to figure out how to get the current slide 'div' for the onLoad event
[03:39:47] <dan2k3k4> as I do: var id = $($slideElement).find('h3').attr('data-id');
[03:39:53] <dan2k3k4> in onSlideBefore :/
[04:11:35] <dan2k3k4> nvm figured a different way
[05:03:47] <Kapulara> Hey, Mouseout / Mousein has unexpected behavior on my page. It seems like it triggers the event whenever i hover over an image.
[05:04:00] <Kapulara> Is anyone able to take a look at this?
[05:05:22] <Xentil> Kapulara: yes
[05:06:44] <Xentil> Kapulara: i am able
[05:06:53] <Kapulara> Xentil: Creating jsfiddle as we speak.
[05:14:40] <Kapulara> https://jsfiddle.net/7knytre9/1/
[05:14:48] <Kapulara> I can't get jquery to work? Xentil
[05:16:09] <Xentil> Kapulara: click on "JAVASCRIPT *" button
[05:16:30] <Kapulara> Xentil: I did that, Then selected edge. But it still says $ undefined in the console :/
[05:16:31] <user_corrupt> any recommendations for a simple, cross-browser compatible, light-weight modal dialog plugin? I've had some problems with some that I found on Google
[05:17:35] <Xentil> Kapulara: i am running your foiddle but i have no message that # is undefined
[05:17:46] <Kapulara> That's weird. :o
[05:18:18] <Xentil> $
[05:18:30] <Kapulara> $('body'), When i run that it says null...
[05:19:42] <Kapulara> Refresh the page
[05:19:43] <Kapulara> I fixed it
[05:21:06] <Xentil> Kapulara: i refreshed the page and still $('body') is null fo me
[05:21:20] <Kapulara> https://jsfiddle.net/7knytre9/3/
[05:21:31] <Kapulara> The difference is in the link oops.
[05:21:36] <Kapulara> Xentil: ^
[05:22:30] <Xentil> Kapulara: ok, now it is working well
[05:22:55] <Xentil> Kapulara: and what is the problem now ?
[05:23:28] <Kapulara> Open up the console and look for went out of window
[05:23:31] <Kapulara> and went in of window
[05:23:44] <Xentil> Kapulara: i can see "Went in windows." nad "Went out window." messages on console
[05:23:45] <Kapulara> It procs that between elements and hovering over the right and left side of images
[05:24:06] <Kapulara> While it only should proc when going out of the window
[05:27:03] <Xentil> Kapulara: i can see "Went in windows." when mouse move over the frame and "Went out windows." when mouse move out the frame, only.
[05:27:46] <Kapulara> That's weird. Not when you hover over the images?
[05:27:58] <Kapulara> Or go over the splitting line on the right and left side of the elements?
[05:28:50] <Xentil> Kapulara: sorry, i refreshed the page and click Run and now it is behaving diffrent
[05:30:10] <Xentil> Kapulara: i am testing it
[05:33:55] <Xentil> Kapulara: i start in mouse out of a frame, and when i move mouse over pink are i got "...in..." message, and when i move over gray area i can see bot messages, then if i move over second pink area i can see both messages, and then when i move out of a frame i can see "out" message
[05:34:05] <Xentil> area
[05:34:18] <Kapulara> Yeah. While it only should do it on window right?
[05:34:35] <Xentil> Kapulara: yes
[05:35:29] <Kapulara> Is there any way you can come up to fix this?
[05:35:35] <Xentil> Kapulara: where is the line where you attach function to this event ?
[05:36:50] <Kapulara> I use the wrong events.
[05:36:53] <Kapulara> used*
[05:37:22] <Kapulara> I should have used: mouseleave instead of mouseout
[05:37:29] <Kapulara> Now its behaving correctly :D
[05:37:53] <Xentil> Kapulara: yes, i can see it
[05:41:02] <Xentil> Kapulara: is this working right now for you ?
[05:45:34] <Kapulara> Yeah thanks for helping out Xentil :D
[05:53:30] <kostodo> How do i check if an element is NOT display: none?

[06:18:14] <lemonsparrow> I have an array of promises.. what I need is in the catch block.. I want to add all the failing api url to be added to an array https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/664eaf2a988d34e35c73
[06:18:17] <lemonsparrow> is it possible
[06:18:19] <lemonsparrow> ?
[06:18:44] <Tennis> paste.ee your code sigdk
[06:19:54] <Tennis> erm lemonsparrow, kind of in my head though jquery isnt going to store between peoples sessions
[06:20:16] <lemonsparrow> Tennis, angular way ?
[06:20:22] <Tennis> maybe on your failing api url log to db server side the url at hand
[06:21:16] <Tennis> i know it wouldnt be a an array but you could build it into one, or like theres some browser storage but then between users wouldnt be adding urls to the same array

[09:14:23] <hellyeah> or you want to show it when you click button
[09:15:00] <hellyeah> you do smt { display:none } .show{ display:block} and in jquery side you can use addClass

[09:58:53] <z1haze> Im trying to figure out what I could possible be doing wrong here. I am using browserify to compile my scripts but for some stupid fking reason, whenever I try to include jquery, jquery ui i get an error saying jquery is undefined. can someone PLEASE help me figure this stupidness out? If I just mix the scripts without doing require('jquery') blah blah it works.. but i have a single js script that I want to include that has all my require stuff in it
[09:59:59] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2H1QHV7 is my script

[10:34:25] <z1haze> any idea why mixing the same series of files in browserify would cause undefined errors, but requiring them all in the same sequence whith <script src= ... works fine?
[10:39:00] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask jquery ui question
[10:39:37] <hellyeah> you can drag and drop button here and transfer button from one div into another you can create multiple divs  when you drop button onto another http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/102/ this is axis:y  and there is no positioning problem but  when axis is not enable there is some problem about positioning do you have any idea what can be the reason http://

[11:19:41] <eindoofus> looks like "done" is the new way of doing things ajax calls, but does "done" only get triggered on a 400?
[11:19:50] <eindoofus> with*
[11:21:12] <eindoofus> been looking through the docs and see that it's triggered on a "success" and i want to assume it just means 400, but my novice brain is making me second-guess that answer
[12:26:12] <taplar> 400 is an error not success
[12:26:32] <_TWG_> how can I not show "undefined" when I'm writing each row of a JSON file to a table?
[12:27:13] <Tennis> if thing == undefined { do something else }
[12:27:54] <taplar> thing || ''
[12:39:05] <akkufomk> Tennis: if typeof thing === 'undefined' { }
[12:41:57] <duch_kazatel> no need for typeof.
[12:42:07] <duch_kazatel> var myThing = otherthing || '';
[12:42:15] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, just if (otherThing) {}
[12:49:49] <dopie> Hey all
[13:05:50] <z1haze> hey i am getting imgFake is undefined after this slider tries to go to the next slide, whether it be automatic or by clicking a button. I do not understand it. The function is defined on page load because I can alert from inside the function. and the only time it wouldnt be would be if elem.length is 0 which i alert any time before i call imgFake() and its always 1.. i dont understand!
[13:05:51] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3GRJ3HE
[13:06:30] <duch_kazatel> z1haze that's over 2,000 lines.
[13:06:40] <z1haze> yea its a mess
[13:06:46] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:07:00] <duch_kazatel> you realize that's kind of unreasonable, yeah?
[13:07:04] <z1haze> like 665 defines the function
[13:07:12] <z1haze> yea i do, i just dont know how else to figure it out
[13:07:13] <duch_kazatel> lol good luck mano :)
[13:07:17] <z1haze> ah ok
[13:07:18] <z1haze> thanks
[13:07:31] <persina> Is there a way to change the pointRadius of a single path element?
[13:07:45] <duch_kazatel> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions z1haze you might want to read up on this.
[13:09:55] <taplar> z1haze: just to talk broadly about it.  functions, like variables, have scope.  if you define them inside another function they will only be accessable in that function.  if your trying to access them outside, your gonna have a bad time.
[13:10:11] <cangelosx> I'm looking for the cleanest, simplest way to simulate typing into form inputs. I've googled it, found jquery.simulate.ext, but it's outdated and having dependency issues. Any ideas?
[13:10:43] <z1haze> yea i just 'fixed' it by defined that function at the beginning of my file, but taplar here's the confusing part. all of these issues started when i begin using browserify to mix them all into a single far
[13:10:55] <taplar> *shrug*
[13:10:55] <cangelosx> I don't need human-like typing simulation (timing, errors, etc). I just need to manually type into form inputs.
[13:10:56] <z1haze> when i was including all of the files on my pages manually with script src= i never have a single problem
[13:11:08] <z1haze> single file* not far
[13:11:30] <z1haze> can you give some insight as to what could cause this craziness? it took like 3 hours to get this one file to work correctly after browerifying it
[13:11:39] <taplar> cangelosx: what problem are you trying to solve?
[13:11:42] <z1haze> i had a ton of undefined variables etc that i have to fix
[13:11:51] <taplar> i don't know anything about browerify.  i just know scope rules
[13:13:04] <z1haze> would using strict cause those problems? maybe browserify uses strict
[13:13:32] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[13:13:58] <taplar> easy enough to test though
[13:15:25] <One3yed> anyone know how I can use the jquery plugin boilerplate template to call internal plugin functions from outside?
[13:15:58] <duch_kazatel> One3yed context?
[13:16:10] <duch_kazatel> One3yed you have to expose those functions somehow soooo...
[13:16:11] <One3yed> I need to do something like $("#myelement").myPlugin('callFunction');
[13:16:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you can do that.  it's kind of awkward
[13:16:38] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap does something similar.
[13:16:42] <cangelosx> taplar: Client has a web application that seems to be sloppy made where autofilling forms using element.val() seems to be introducing fatal errors on the server side with heavy financial consequences.
[13:17:16] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx errr/.
[13:17:18] <taplar> cangelosx: are the fields doing logic as the users type?
[13:17:27] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx it sounds like you need a validation library.
[13:17:29] <cangelosx> taplar: it's very possible.
[13:17:41] <taplar> maybe figure that out?
[13:17:43] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I have no control over the client's application.
[13:17:46] <duch_kazatel> and that the validation needs to run on submit.
[13:17:56] <taplar> val(newvalue) won't cause the default change events and other things to fire
[13:17:58] <duch_kazatel> then how can you be expected to fix anything?
[13:18:21] <cangelosx> obviously, manually typing the input fixes the problem.
[13:18:32] <cangelosx> If I can simulate manually typing, then there is no problem.
[13:18:58] <taplar> it seems like your understanding of it is just that there is 'a problem'
[13:19:10] <cangelosx> I don't think you're understanding me correctly.
[13:19:13] <duch_kazatel> you're being asked to fix something but have no control over the codebase for it.
[13:19:17] <cangelosx> I have no access to the client's application.
[13:19:25] <cangelosx> My app runs as a chrome plugin that autofills forms on the page.
[13:19:36] <taplar> and you have no way of viewing the page sources.
[13:19:39] <cangelosx> no.
[13:19:42] <taplar> lol
[13:19:47] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to get comfy with .trigger() then.
[13:20:16] <taplar> right click, view source or inspect.  hey!  page sources!
[13:21:27] <duch_kazatel> taplar what he's trying to point out is that he can't edit the client application to fix the underlying problem.
[13:21:50] <taplar> i'm saying he can view the sources to possibly track down the events being attached
[13:22:09] <duch_kazatel> (that wasn't the impression i was getting from you :) )
[13:23:35] <taplar> i'm just being snarky.  i saw a lot of 'i cant's.
[13:23:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:24:07] <cangelosx> Yeah, I'm not sure what was so funny about my question, but I appreciate your patience,
[13:24:16] <duch_kazatel> i'm not laughing at you.
[13:24:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm laughing because taplar is being snarky :)
[13:24:37] <cangelosx> It was directed at him, actually, lol.
[13:24:40] <cangelosx> not you.
[13:24:42] <duch_kazatel> oh hah
[13:24:43] <cangelosx> but thank you both anyway
[13:24:43] <duch_kazatel> welp
[13:24:44] <taplar> you can use trigger() like duch_kazatel suggests, but you need to know what to trigger
[13:24:52] <cangelosx> The biggest issue is that the client's application is subject to change at any time.
[13:25:00] <taplar> and to do that, you need to investigate 'what' the actualy problem is
[13:25:05] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx erm.
[13:25:12] <duch_kazatel> then you're going to be chasing your talk constantly.
[13:25:17] <taplar> what is not happening on val(newValue) that is when a user actually types
[13:25:26] <duch_kazatel> like... this is something that you'll never get truly ahead of.
[13:25:52] <duch_kazatel> you can use .trigger() to fire change, input, keydown, keyup, keypress, etc. but that's going to be really awkward.
[13:26:00] <taplar> i don't even know if you manually created the character events and sent them to the element if that would work
[13:26:13] <taplar> seems heavy handed though
[13:26:16] <duch_kazatel> taplar if you simulated all the events, sure.
[13:26:46] <duch_kazatel> the underlying problem here is that you're trying to solve a problem you can never truly solve.  unless you want to build out the ultimate "simulated input" plugin.
[13:26:54] <cangelosx> and to be correct, it's not the client's application. it's an application for one of their vedors.
[13:26:57] <cangelosx> I'll be right back.
[13:28:08] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: there was a jquery simulate ext plugin which was like element.type("hello world")
[13:28:09] <cangelosx> brb
[13:28:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying it doesn't exist, but that's such a niche problem that has to chase and change with the times so much that I doubt anybody is really interested in staying on top of it.
[13:28:56] <taplar> typetype?
[13:29:02] <taplar> *from a quick google
[13:30:08] <taplar> lol, man.  i just had a quick flashback of like doogiehowser
[13:30:22] <taplar> *sp
[13:46:11] <cangelosx> ok im back
[13:46:21] <cangelosx> so how do you go about using trigger to simulate this?
[13:46:32] <cangelosx> I only need it for text inputs
[13:46:59] <duch_kazatel> by triggering all the associated events that could run.
[13:47:12] <cangelosx> so focus on element then trigger letter by letter?
[13:47:30] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[13:48:13] <cangelosx> so run through string as a character array, convert character to ascii code then trigger keypress with that code?
[13:48:39] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:48:44] <duch_kazatel> more involved than that.
[13:49:15] <cangelosx> I apologize for my ignorance; I'm not too good with javascript/jquery. How would you do it?
[13:49:59] <duch_kazatel> focus, trigger event, per character, trigger keydown, trigger keypress, insert char, trigger keyup, trigger change.
[13:50:04] <duch_kazatel> err, trigger input.
[13:50:31] <cangelosx> Oh.
[13:50:57] <cangelosx> so you're not "physically" typing. You actually insert the char by changing value directly?
[13:51:44] <cangelosx> if that's the only way to do it and it must involve changing the input's val directly, it might not fix the problem.
[13:51:50] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:51:57] <duch_kazatel> i just explained the part that fixes it.
[13:52:01] <cangelosx> Although I suspect that focusing in, changing the value and then focusing to the next one might.
[13:52:02] <duch_kazatel> you have to manually trigger the series of events.
[13:52:05] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:52:17] <duch_kazatel> if you want to really fix this, you have to trigger the many events involved.
[13:52:35] <cangelosx> To be safe that you triggered all possible events?
[13:52:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:53:41] <cangelosx> Forgive me, but I would have thought that triggering a keypress of a certain key code would actually type the character, but I guess that's more of an operating system hook than a browser thing
[13:53:51] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating concepts.
[13:53:58] <duch_kazatel> it's still a browser thing.
[13:54:06] <duch_kazatel> but you have to manually construct the entire event object in that case.
[13:54:12] <duch_kazatel> but you can still hook to other events.,
[13:54:26] <cangelosx> in your series of events, you say "insert char"
[13:54:29] <cangelosx> what is that?
[13:54:41] <duch_kazatel> however you choose to insert a character.
[13:54:49] <cangelosx> element.val(element.val()+'a') ?
[13:54:52] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[13:55:40] <cangelosx> so what you're saying is that you directly change the value while making the page think you typed it in?
[13:55:47] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:55:52] <duch_kazatel> that's what the event triggering is all abouit.
[13:56:09] <duch_kazatel> you're focusing on the value changing - you need to fire all oif the related events as well.
[13:56:41] <cangelosx> I understand, but my original question was if there was a way where through javascript or jquery you could trigger a simulated type event that actually types it in for you, as if you physically typed it
[13:56:52] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of, no.
[13:56:57] <duch_kazatel> not without a lot of boilerplate.
[13:57:21] <cangelosx> which would most likely be operating system dependent, yes?
[13:57:25] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:57:32] <cangelosx> browser dependent?
[13:57:34] <duch_kazatel> those events are pretty standard browser to browser.
[13:57:53] <cangelosx> and I supposed it wouldn't be jquery related
[13:58:04] <duch_kazatel> though you'd probably have to drop town to vanilla JS to be safest, in which case there'll be a few differences here and there.
[13:59:07] <cangelosx> alright. But if the problem is with the page performing some sort of validation, I suppose your solution should work. The problem is that the only way to test it to actually go through with the transaction ($$$ issues) and see if it causes a problem.
[13:59:23] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[13:59:31] <duch_kazatel> they should provide you with a testing environment.
[13:59:49] <cangelosx> the client doesn't own the application; it's provided by one of their merchants
[13:59:59] <duch_kazatel> then the client should work with the vendor to get you that.
[14:00:07] <cangelosx> Not a possibly
[14:00:17] <duch_kazatel> then they're being unreasonable imo.
[14:00:20] <cangelosx> I know it's easy to say you're screwed
[14:00:26] <duch_kazatel> and putting you in a really bad position.
[14:00:34] <cangelosx> the merchant's application is meant for full human interaction
[14:00:36] <duch_kazatel> you're not screwed, your client is being unreasonable.
[14:00:43] <arc_> trying to develop in a production environment is ludicrous
[14:00:53] <cangelosx> my application simply sends information from the client's database to easily autofill it in the merchant's application
[14:01:18] <cangelosx> I understand, but theoretically if one can simulate and trigger "physically" typing, then it would be no problem
[14:01:24] <cangelosx> it would exactly the same thing as the user typing
[14:01:46] <duch_kazatel> except that's now using the DOM in a way it's not really meant to be used.
[14:02:01] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like your client is working against their system instead of trying to fix the underlying problem.
[14:02:02] <cangelosx> the biggest issue is that if merchant changes their front-end code, my app breaks
[14:02:16] <duch_kazatel> right.  your client needs to understand and accept that.
[14:02:19] <arc_> that's going to happen regardless of anything
[14:02:26] <cangelosx> currently, the client just copy pastes information from their system into the merchant's web application
[14:02:36] <cangelosx> my app aims to autofill that
[14:02:39] <duch_kazatel> which is why you don't use chrome extensions for things like that,.
[14:02:46] <cangelosx> why is that?
[14:02:55] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to use a frontend as an API..
[14:05:14] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: it's an API obviously, it's just a simply autofill process
[14:05:17] <cangelosx> it's an assisting tool
[14:05:19] <cangelosx> nothing wrong with that
[14:05:20] <duch_kazatel> err.
[14:05:22] <duch_kazatel> web pages are not APIs.
[14:05:49] <cangelosx> even if I were to gain access to the web application, I could only look at the code that is already processed. The thing the client is looking at
[14:05:51] <duch_kazatel> and this "assisting tool" is trying to fix a problem that shouldn't be an issue in the first place.
[14:05:57] <cangelosx> and then I would still save 2 problems:
[14:06:03] <duch_kazatel> right - the vendor needs to provide a solution.
[14:06:09] <cangelosx> 1. There is no guarantee it's going to work
[14:06:22] <cangelosx> 2. If the merchant changes their front-end code, the application breaks
[14:06:47] <duch_kazatel> and again, i go back to my original point - the software vendor really should supply an API for you to work with :)
[14:06:52] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: that's a business decision, not a development one
[14:06:56] <arc_> right. so you're spending your time developing something, with the fundamental issue that you don't actually know if it can possibly work when you're done
[14:07:03] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:07:09] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like a development problem to me.
[14:07:12] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: "The merchant should supply an API" is not a solution
[14:07:23] <duch_kazatel> then follow what i explained earlier.
[14:07:31] <duch_kazatel> and trigger all those events manually using native JS.
[14:07:36] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty much the best you can do.
[14:08:08] <cangelosx> My job is to make an autofill tool that simulates typing into a web app. It ends there and go no further.
[14:08:18] <cangelosx> "Talk to the merchant about an API" is just.....
[14:08:22] <cangelosx> retarded.
[14:08:28] <duch_kazatel> hey, so that word isn't ok.
[14:08:35] <cangelosx> I'm sorry.
[14:08:37] <duch_kazatel> and i don't appreciate the sentiment attached to it - thanks :)
[14:08:43] <cangelosx> I apologize.
[14:08:47] <duch_kazatel> so!  you'll need to use native JS and handle all of that.
[14:08:54] <cangelosx> alright.
[14:08:58] <cangelosx> That's really all I was asking.
[14:09:09] <cangelosx> If the problem can't be fixed with jquery, then I'll look into JS.
[14:09:11] <duch_kazatel> i just hate seeing people set themselves up to get burned later.
[14:09:22] <duch_kazatel> and you're using JS already anyway :)_
[14:09:34] <cangelosx> But it's simply outrageous to "fix" a problem by saying "Well they should change their business model"
[14:09:39] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[14:09:42] <arc_> -_-
[14:09:42] <cangelosx> again, I apologize.
[14:09:49] <duch_kazatel> your client is being unreasonable.
[14:09:52] <duch_kazatel> 100%
[14:09:56] <cangelosx> well no shit
[14:09:59] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:09:59] <cangelosx> but that doesn't matter
[14:10:00] <cangelosx> not my job
[14:10:02] <duch_kazatel> that's my entire point.
[14:10:06] <cangelosx> and it's not the client
[14:10:08] <cangelosx> it's the merchant
[14:10:24] <cangelosx> if the merchant had an API, the client would be giving me this job.
[14:10:32] <duch_kazatel> the client is tryign to shoehorn in a solution and are being unreasonable in their approach imo.
[14:10:34] <cangelosx> but as I said, none of that really matter
[14:10:34] <duch_kazatel> but sure :)
[14:10:40] <cangelosx> The merchant has shitty code, yes.
[14:10:45] <cangelosx> I agree 100%
[14:10:49] <cangelosx> and that is the problem
[14:10:54] <cangelosx> but my job is to fix that
[14:11:20] <cangelosx> now, are you telling me it's possible to just use JS to do that? and by native JS, you just mean good old regular javascript>
[14:11:30] <duch_kazatel> back up.
[14:11:39] <cangelosx> not fix that, but rather, get around it
[14:11:48] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying that you can try to resolve this problem today - tomorrow?  things could very easily break.
[14:12:00] <duch_kazatel> it's going to be fragile.
[14:12:15] <cangelosx> if you create a solution that "physically" types, why would there be a problem?
[14:12:24] <cangelosx> it won't submit any forms. simply type.
[14:12:32] <cangelosx> which is why I was saying, it's not meant tobe an API
[14:12:33] <duch_kazatel> if the markup changes tomorrow? suddenly all of your work fails.
[14:12:56] <cangelosx> the markup is a textbox with a name
[14:13:02] <duch_kazatel> all sorts of things can fail in this scenario - you're going to have to accept that will happen.
[14:13:51] <cangelosx> the names can change, but i can easily fix that in my app by creating an interface that scans the page and lets the user match up text boxes with the fields they have
[14:14:06] <duch_kazatel> this is just part of the risk you accept when building extensions.
[14:14:07] <cangelosx> so assuming the selector doesn't change or is easily fixable
[14:14:15] <cangelosx> how would you use native JS?
[14:14:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:14:30] <cangelosx> okay.
[14:14:49] <duch_kazatel> "how would you use native JS"?  not sure what you're asking there.
[14:15:06] <cangelosx> you told me you can use native JS to simulate typing.
[14:15:13] <cangelosx> you also said if the markup changes then you have a problem
[14:15:19] <cangelosx> assuming the markup doesnt change
[14:15:24] <cangelosx> how do you use JS to do it?
[14:15:27] <duch_kazatel> i gave a step by step earlier.
[14:16:31] <duch_kazatel> you'll also want to read up on events, binding, and delegation to make sure you're triggering things correctly and that things are getting to wherever they need to go.
[14:17:09] <cangelosx> Okay.
[14:17:19] <cangelosx> You were saying it wasn't possible with jquery, but possible with native JS.
[14:17:23] <cangelosx> What do you mean by that?
[14:17:29] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i said.
[14:17:41] <duch_kazatel> jquery events and native DOM events are a little different.
[14:17:46] <cangelosx> (01:08:47 PM) duch_kazatel: so!  you'll need to use native JS and handle all of that.
[14:18:09] <duch_kazatel> right, that doesn't mean it's not possible with jquery, but it'll be safest with native JS.
[14:18:19] <duch_kazatel> since jquery events and native DOM events aren't the same thing.
[14:18:22] <cangelosx> Skay. That's what I mean. Sorry.
[14:18:42] <birdy247_> Hi, is it possible to essentially move the position on a select menu?
[14:18:47] <birdy247_> of*
[14:18:55] <Synthead> is there a way I can do something like this?  var method = "height"; $(window).send(method) ?  This is a Ruby-ism, btw
[14:19:04] <duch_kazatel> birdy247_ not sure what you mean.  could you clarify?
[14:19:09] <shoky> also you can't simulate typing 100%  and since " autofilling forms using element.val() seems to be introducing fatal errors "  i don't see how triggering events would help?
[14:19:17] <birdy247_> ok, so i have a slideToggle
[14:19:22] <shoky> oops i was scrolled up a bit
[14:19:27] <birdy247_> I have a select box which puts markers on a map
[14:19:36] <duch_kazatel> shoky :) gotta trigger lots of events.  even then there's no guarantee.
[14:19:46] <shoky> trigger them, why?
[14:19:49] <birdy247_> when the user slideToggles the element, I want the select menu to be in a different part of the screen
[14:19:50] <duch_kazatel> validation.
[14:20:00] <shoky> which happens on which event?
[14:20:11] <duch_kazatel> they don't know, and it could change tomorrow.
[14:20:16] <birdy247_> make sense?
[14:20:28] <duch_kazatel> they're building a chrome extension for a 3rd party platform.
[14:20:32] <shoky> well they don't care about tomorrow, it seems
[14:20:40] <shoky> since they care only about today
[14:20:47] <shoky> why not see exactly what is triggering the validation?
[14:20:50] <duch_kazatel> just don't want to see them get burned.
[14:21:01] <duch_kazatel> but sure - go ahead and disagree with my entire point in a few lines :)
[14:21:02] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[14:21:26] <birdy247_> if i clone a select menu
[14:21:34] <cangelosx> shoky: I'm suspecting a js library in the background doing some sort of validation as you type.
[14:21:40] <birdy247_> can it then change the value of the orginal and vice versa?
[14:21:49] <shoky> duch i was just asking, sry ;p
[14:22:03] <shoky> cangelosx: why suspect instead of actually check?
[14:22:07] <cangelosx> ....
[14:22:35] <shoky> okay then
[14:22:41] <cangelosx> shoky: 1. I don't have access to the merchant's web application 2. even if I did, it could change and break.
[14:23:36] <shoky> 1. why not view source? debugger?   2.  obviously, but no solution could solve that
[14:23:52] <cangelosx> shoky: and even if I did have access and checked it, and made a solution around it, there's no guarantee it will fix the problem. The only way to test it to actually go through with the transaction in a production environment.
[14:24:13] <shoky> don't see how that's relevant
[14:24:27] <cangelosx> shoky: my application is a chrome extension that autofills forms.
[14:24:32] <shoky> yep
[14:24:32] <birdy247_> If I clone a select menu
[14:24:38] <birdy247_> i.e. it exists twice on the page
[14:24:41] <cangelosx> shoky: it runs in the client's browser.
[14:24:47] <cangelosx> shoky: I don't have access to it.
[14:24:49] <birdy247_> can the values be kept the same when a user changes 1?
[14:24:57] <cangelosx> shoky: and I can't test on a production environment.
[14:25:01] <shoky> cangelosx you have no idea about the page it'll run in?
[14:25:31] <cangelosx> shoky: no. I don't. And said I said, even if I had full access to the web application as the client sees it, I cannot test it.
[14:25:51] <shoky> you're developing something you can't test ?
[14:25:55] <cangelosx> .....
[14:26:03] <Levure> Hello !
[14:26:07] <cangelosx> not another lecture.
[14:26:31] <shoky> it was a question, actually, but nevermind, enjyo
[14:26:34] <shoky> enjoy
[14:26:38] <cangelosx> shoky: the only testing I can do is to create a web form and make sure my plugin autofills it by simulating a user typing.
[14:26:53] <Levure> Is there a way to avoid preprend() to add line-break after the preprended content ?
[14:27:13] <relipse> does anyone know how to get this effect: http://i.imgur.com/ygElULM.gifv
[14:27:17] <cangelosx> shoky: if my app can actually simulate typing without directly change an input's value, then there is no testing needed.
[14:27:24] <cangelosx> shoky: do you understand?
[14:27:32] <shoky> you can't simulate typing without directly changing an input's value
[14:27:56] <shoky> afaik
[14:28:27] <relipse> does anyone see the <ul><li>...</li></ul> in http://i.imgur.com/ygElULM.gifv i am trying to achieve but safari is making it go balistic
[14:28:34] <cangelosx> shoky: see, if someone told me that when I first asked the damned question, it wouldn't be a problem. But everyone starts lecturing me on how the merchant needs to make an API and and how they need to provide a testing env blah blah blah.
[14:28:39] <shoky> well, maybe chrome extension API has something special for that,
[14:28:45] <shoky> but that would be a topic for another channel
[14:30:31] <relipse> no one?
[14:31:20] <relipse> i'm trying to achieve a <div class="left"> <div class="center"><ul><li>one</li><li>two</li><li>three</li></ul></div> which circulates it vertically like seen in this gif: http://i.imgur.com/ygElULM.gifv
[14:57:02] <claytonzaugg> Any suggestions on how to make a nav at the bottom of the display instead of the top?  I'm trying to add a "sticky" menu to the bottom so no matter what screen it is, it'll always be at the bottom.
[14:58:10] <_TWG_> That would be more of a CSS question than jquery.
[14:58:42] <claytonzaugg> Okay, thank you
[14:59:21] <_TWG_> claytonzaugg: you will want to do a position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0;
[14:59:24] <_TWG_> right: 0;
[15:00:14] <claytonzaugg> Awesome! Thank you _TWG_

[16:37:20] <wa5ted> when i started it was v1.5
[16:38:34] <Drewery> is there a channel for jquery ui ?
[16:39:10] <taplar> that would be this one

[16:49:41] <wa5ted> long time brother
[16:49:44] <wa5ted> how are things
[16:49:59] <Drewery> I am using jquery UI range slider... it initiates successfully but won't pickup on the callback functions... any thoughts?   example: $("#elementID").slider({
[16:50:02] <Drewery>     start: function() {
[16:50:04] <Drewery>         console.log("starting now");
[16:50:05] <Drewery> my bad...
[16:50:06] <shoky> some good some less good ;p sup
[16:50:07] <Drewery>     }
[16:50:30] <taplar> Drewery: make a fiddle, don't paste code in the chat
[16:50:35] <wa5ted> woooooahhh purge?
[16:50:45] <Drewery> taplar: I didn't meant o
[16:50:54] <Drewery> mistake
[16:51:18] <wa5ted> shoky: nothing much, changed my focus moving away from code, focusing on design with development on the side
[16:52:04] <Drewery> so this code : https://jsfiddle.net/dqzbsdo2/   the slider works but why it wouldn't do the callbacks?
[16:52:07] <shoky> hope you're kicking ass ;p

[16:55:54] <wa5ted> shoky:  thanks, still remember you helping me when i started learning jquery back in the v1.5 days
[16:56:02] <taplar> so pictures are rarely helpful.  do you have an example of the issue?  what do you mean by change the position of tab?
[16:56:09] <shoky> think you had a longer nick then ;p

[17:54:31] <richie2> Noob question: To get the percentage of something would it be "var percentage = parseFloat(input / 100)"
[17:54:59] <taplar> what is input?
[17:55:44] <richie2> any number I would put in the form box
[17:55:48] <richie2> 1-100
[17:55:52] <taplar> so text
[17:56:00] <richie2> yeah
[17:56:00] <taplar> parseInt(input) / 100
[17:56:15] <richie2> ah okay, thanks
[17:56:37] <taplar> and to be more concise
[17:56:41] <taplar> parseInt(input, 10) / 100
[17:59:47] <richie2> ty
[18:00:35] <bonks> Could someone help me with deferred objects? I have a collection of tasks, when all are complete and I want do something. All my populate methods are similar to the method on top: http://pastebin.com/TJdJie0a
[18:01:20] <bonks> The behavior is when the caller of the returned deferred object calls done(), the populate functions haven't been called yet
[18:02:19] <taplar> ok.  so you want to return a deferred that will evaluate a done when all the other things are done?
[18:02:35] <bonks> taplar: Yes
[18:03:37] <taplar> ok, if you want to go the var mypromise = $.Deferred() route all you would have to do is do after everything is done do mypromise.resolve('some optional input')
[18:04:18] <cangelosx> how do you listen to a select element being selected, even if it's the same value?
[18:04:35] <taplar> cangelosx: that's not really an event
[18:04:49] <taplar> maybe a combination of change and blur
[18:05:06] <cangelosx> if it's the same value, it won't fire change
[18:05:10] <bonks> taplar: I only used this route because I saw an example online. And I did put the resolve() call in the last done().
[18:05:19] <cangelosx> and if you don't click outside, blur wont fire
[18:05:27] <taplar> right
[18:07:19] <cangelosx> taplar: so how do you catch something like that?
[18:07:31] <taplar> you don't.  like i said, it's not an event
[18:07:36] <cangelosx> i cant use click oviously
[18:07:42] <cangelosx> i guess i could use option.click
[18:08:01] <taplar> sure, which would fire on every click, including the first open
[18:08:16] <taplar> oh
[18:08:24] <taplar> or you might try attaching an on click to the options
[18:08:28] <taplar> not sure if that is valid though
[18:08:37] <cangelosx> thats what i meant
[18:08:49] <cangelosx> i can put it on elements that are not currently selected
[18:08:56] <cangelosx> so it doesnt fire until you make a selection
[18:09:32] <taplar> so give it a go
[18:11:26] <bonks> taplar: I think I know the problem. By chaining all those populate methods in the done(), it is not blocking because the populate methods return a deferred object
[18:12:02] <cangelosx> blur is not firing when you click it and click something else
[18:12:31] <taplar> how are you binding?
[18:14:25] <taplar> cangelosx: https://jsfiddle.net/nggyjxce/
[18:15:01] <cangelosx> taplar: nope
[18:15:05] <cangelosx> thanks though
[18:15:11] <cangelosx> i just went with click on the select
[18:15:16] * taplar is fixing to go play in traffic.  please direct your question to other friendly peeps, :)
[18:15:21] <cangelosx> it will ajax every i do but itll do for now
[18:15:24] <taplar> that fiddle alerts when i click the options
[18:15:39] <cangelosx> weird i dont get anything
[18:15:43] <cangelosx> chrome on ubuntu
[18:15:43] <taplar> browser?
[18:15:45] <cangelosx> anyway thanks
[18:15:52] <taplar> ah, may be something there.  *Shrugs*
[18:15:56] <cangelosx> thank you sir
[18:15:59] <taplar> later!  gl
[18:35:34] <akkufomk> cangelosx: use $('select').on('change', function() { });
[18:36:10] <akkufomk> cangelosx: I think the only thing you can set click on is the select element itself
[18:36:11] <cangelosx> akkufomk: doesn't fire if you select the same option as current
[18:37:18] <bonks> Is there a shorter way to return another promise for "return $.ajax().done()"? Instead of creating a $.Deferred object and resolving within done()?
[18:37:44] <akkufomk> https://jsfiddle.net/tbcprskc/

[18:42:57] <shoky> bonks: you might be looking for .then()
[18:45:04] <Synthead> is there a good way to append some code to jQuery UI methods without completely replacing it?
[18:45:45] <Synthead> at the moment, I'm overriding methods via the documented $.widget("ui.menu", $.extend({}, $.ui.menu.prototype, {}))
[18:47:34] <shoky> Synthead you can also just create your own widget that extends a jquery-ui widget, replacing/adding the methods you want. and you can always call this._super()
[18:47:37] <akkufomk> Synthead: You can inherit from the object and change it
[18:47:51] <akkufomk> $.widget('my.widget', ui.menu, {
[18:48:45] <Synthead> akkufomk: what would the rest of the syntax look like?  would I just declare an object of functions like usual, just with the "appended" code?
[18:49:07] <shoky> Synthead: https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/#extending-existing-methods
[18:50:20] <akkufomk> http://pastie.org/10676980
[18:51:11] <Synthead> shoky: ah, like this! https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/#redefining-widgets
[18:51:19] <Synthead> man, this is great.  thanks all!
[18:51:37] <shoky> Synthead: that's if you want to completely redefine an existing widget, ya
[18:51:57] <Synthead> shoky: well, redefine with its own code and then some
[18:52:09] <Synthead> shoky: at least that's how I'm reading it
[18:52:26] <shoky> well yeah. but then you can't make a widget without that added code
[18:52:37] <Synthead> shoky: yeah for sure :)
[18:54:54] <Synthead> just tested it and it works great :D
[20:09:36] <adv_> how do i draw a spiral/curl with bezierCurveTo or quadraticCurveTo?
[20:20:05] <Jay305> Hi, when you click "Go" on my website it'll build the url and take you to it, but instead i'd like to put that url into a variable where i can echo the data from the xml file, is this possible? http://108.61.174.129/
[20:45:40] <cetabio> hi
[20:53:28] <Jay305> Hi guys, is there any way i can display raw data on my own domain from this domain? http://api.indeed.com/ads/apisearch?publisher=8577534589972446&q=&l=&sort=&radius=250&st=&jt=&start=&limit=&formage=&filter=&latlong=&co=GB&userip=81.110.16.63&useragent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+6.1%3B+WOW64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F47.0.2526.106+Safari%2F537.36&v=2
[20:54:03] <Jay305> i'd just like to replace that domain with my own domain, and make it load results on my own page
[21:30:37] <sir-D10nysus> Hello, I need some assistance with a  JQuery project
[22:15:25] <z1haze> I am trying to make my own modal, how do you make it to where if you click anywhere outside of the content area of the modal, it will close?
[22:15:41] <z1haze> what type of click event is that
[22:20:17] <ZeuZ> can someone give me a hint on why this 'click' event is not fired when page loads, but does when I copy the same code on the developer console?
[22:20:40] <ZeuZ> will have to give a live link since can't make the popup like context menu work in jsfiddle
[22:23:35] <ZeuZ> Is this permited?
[22:48:21] <Lowell> z1haze: is that called focus?
[22:48:41] <z1haze> i dono
[22:48:49] <z1haze> i figured out a way though
