[05:51:45] <RenjieAbarai> Hi! I have a problem with MutationObserver on safari. It doesn't seem to trigger with style-only changes. Are there any other cross browser alternatives for detecting height adjustment?
[05:56:48] <Cork> mutationObserver can't detect heigh adjustments
[05:56:55] <Cork> it can detect dom modifications
[05:57:18] <Cork> there is a ResizeObserver on the way, but not cross browser yet
[05:58:42] <RenjieAbarai> Cork: mutationObserver works fine on Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Here's my javasript code. Do you know any way to improve this? https://paste.ofcode.org/JhWrcVAwVzmDhYUtPk4D3K
[05:59:07] <Cork> RenjieAbarai: that would be cause you only care about inline on element style changes
[05:59:24] <Cork> but again, it can only detect dom changes, not rendering changes
[05:59:44] <Cork> so for example changes cause a class is changed on a parent element won't be detected
[06:00:53] <RenjieAbarai> Cork: Oh! Thank you for the info. I'll note that down. Any thoughts on my code? https://paste.ofcode.org/JhWrcVAwVzmDhYUtPk4D3K I want to improve it. It looks hackish
[06:01:48] <Cork> oh it is that old hack again...
[06:02:17] <Cork> RenjieAbarai: like i said the last time you asked, if you are working with resized textareas your fighting a losing battle
[06:02:28] <Cork> browser are actively trying to hide that information from the page
[06:02:41] <Cork> and actively lies to you, so it is pointless to fiddle with it
[06:02:48] <thykka> what information? :O
[06:02:59] <Cork> the size of textareas if the user resizes them
[06:03:34] <Cork> the option you have is to disable resizing in css and reimplement it in js
[06:03:47] <Cork> silly, but it is what it is
[06:04:21] <RenjieAbarai> Oh! Hi Cork . I'm sorry I didn't recognize you from last time. I had trouble understanding last time.
[06:04:26] <Cork> "providing the page with the size as the user resizes it would let them prefent it"
[06:04:46] <Cork> but they do provide a resize: none; in css...
[06:05:12] <thykka> c__c
[06:05:43] <Cork> ya, i've actively talked with them as they implemented it (chrome and firefox)
[06:05:48] <Cork> so ya... cluster fuck...
[06:05:55] <RenjieAbarai> Cork: thank you! So what I'm getting is there really isn't any clean way of doing this for now. The code I showed you works fine for what I need for now. I'll stick to this for now. I'll revisit this later.
[06:06:46] <thykka> sounds a bit like what Safari is doing with all the "features" that try to "fix" badly designed websites..
[06:06:47] <Cork> RenjieAbarai: it isn't any clean way to do it, just as there isn't a clean way form site1.com to run what js it like on site2.com without the site2.com accepting it
[06:06:54] <Cork> the browser don't want you to
[06:07:02] <Cork> thykka: ya
[06:07:51] <RenjieAbarai> Thank you again Cork and to you too thykka
[06:08:47] <thykka> not sure what I did, but you're welcome, i guess :D
[06:10:44] <Paradisee> hey o/
[06:11:14] <Paradisee> how can i iterate over the children of a div ?
[06:11:18] <Paradisee> they're nputs
[06:11:33] <thykka> iterate, as in foreach?
[06:11:37] <Paradisee> ya
[06:11:44] <Paradisee> i have something like this:
[06:11:56] <Paradisee> div>div>div>input, input, input
[06:11:57] <thykka> $('div > input').forEach((index, element) => { ... })
[06:11:58] <Cork> Paradisee: you want direct children or any children?
[06:13:06] <Paradisee> it says foreach is not a function
[06:13:21] <Cork> ya, its each not forEach
[06:13:47] <Cork> and depending if you have preprocessors you want to use function(i, e) {}
[06:13:56] <Cork> (it you don't have i mean)
[06:14:07] <Cork> cause => isn't safe to use on the web yet
[06:15:31] <Paradisee> mmm
[06:15:34] <Paradisee> i dont get it
[06:15:50] <Paradisee> i do: $('div input').children()
[06:15:56] <thykka> why?
[06:16:03] <Paradisee> but im not able to iterate over
[06:16:04] <thykka> inputs can't have children
[06:16:42] <Cork> just do $('div').children('input') if you want that format
[06:16:53] <Paradisee> it has a prevObject containing my childs
[06:17:07] <Cork> though, "div" is quite a wide filter
[06:17:31] <Cork> Paradisee: that is cause the parent selector is 'div input'
[06:17:47] <Cork> so by definition the previous jquery object will contains inputs
[06:18:01] <Cork> *will contin inputs
[06:18:11] <Paradisee> $('div').children('input').each(function(a, b) {console.log(a, b);});
[06:18:13] <Paradisee> works
[06:33:25] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/249CGM6
[06:33:45] <Paradisee> how can i exit from thi function without it iterates over each element?
[06:34:23] <Paradisee> i'll buy a book of javascript promise!
[07:13:14] <Cork> Paradisee: you can return false to stop the loop
[07:51:55] <paule32> hello
[07:52:29] <paule32> i have problem with setting "class" properties: http://dpaste.com/2W6818R
[07:52:34] <paule32> line 2
[07:52:40] <paule32> the icon
[07:53:14] <Cork> define "problem"
[07:54:25] <paule32> i have css class ".app_icon_foo", now i would like to use the the name "foo" as attachment of the string ".app_icon_foo"
[07:54:52] <paule32> see line 20
[07:54:56] <Cork> use .app.icon.foo instead
[07:55:02] <Cork> it gives you more options in the future
[07:55:16] <Cork> you shouldn't ever concat class names
[07:55:37] <Cork> instead just add more classes to the element and then you can join them how ever you like
[07:55:51] <paule32> cool
[07:55:53] <paule32> thx
[07:56:10] <Cork> also you should use $().addClass() and removeClass() insetead of className
[07:56:27] <Cork> else you make it inpossible to extend the code without modifying this lines
[08:00:37] <thykka> > You shouldn't ever concat class names <-- BEM would disagree :-)
[08:01:04] <Cork> ya, ugg...
[08:01:23] <Cork> that is one big mess though...
[08:45:53] <paule32> so works nearly perfect
[08:45:54] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/2K1J3QM
[08:46:02] <paule32> next problem see paste
[08:46:17] <paule32> how can i get the window title?
[08:46:36] <paule32> all windows that open in browser have the same size and name
[08:47:44] <paule32> arg
[08:47:47] <paule32> i see
[10:36:01] <tona> hello everyone
[10:37:20] <tona> how could I hide my red box and only show it when I hover on each number , https://jsfiddle.net/nk043zgx/
[10:39:01] <taplar> "each number"?
[10:40:11] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qoyxwdtj/  also don't put a full html document in the html part of the fiddle.  just put your body html in there
[10:40:57] <tona> on the right panel appear number 1,2,3,4,5
[10:41:22] <taplar> i'm only seeing the #3 on the red bar.  if there are more numbers, I don't see them
[10:42:21] <tona> yes there are, but this is my issue , I would like to show them like number 3 when I hover on each one
[10:42:22] <taplar> ok, i have to give it a non-white background to see the other numbers.  white on white is not a great display, :)
[10:45:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qoyxwdtj/1/  you can change the li:on rules to be li:hover, and add the width change of 1px to 140px as part of the css rule also
[10:47:16] <tona> excellent thanks so much
[10:49:09] <tona> taplar one last question, how did you keep this on the right panel if one user scroll down the page , is there one way to appear it again waiting one selection from the user
[10:50:12] <taplar> not sure I follow.  if you are wanting it to stay on the screen that's possibly a css change to make it fixed, or some logic to make it sticky
[10:50:28] <taplar> which either of those would be a question for a css room, not really a jQuery room
[10:50:50] <tona> ok thanks again :)
[11:54:56] <tona> taplar. is there one way to do one fadeout after to make a hover on element under the list , https://jsfiddle.net/qoyxwdtj/1/
[11:55:48] <taplar> not sure I understand what you're asking
[11:57:32] <tona> sorry I am trying to replicate this, https://www.kia.com/mx/showroom/rio-hatchback.html, as you can see on this page has the same component , I woudl like to have the same effect when you change you hover in another position , I would like to see one fade out after to select another number
[11:58:14] <taplar> what do I need to hover over?
[11:58:47] <tona> on the numbers
[11:59:02] <taplar> i don't see numbers on that website you linked
[11:59:33] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Jb768a7.jpg taplar
[11:59:37] <taplar> ooooh, lol, your link had a comma at the end of it
[11:59:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:59:50] <tona> sorry :(
[12:00:01] <taplar> ok, so you want a slider effect like that?
[12:00:21] <robertmaxrees> slider?
[12:00:27] <tona> yes
[12:00:32] <taplar> on hover the bar is sliding in from the right
[12:01:10] <taplar> given what I remember from your css, you could do that most likely one of two ways
[12:01:14] <robertmaxrees> oh i thought you mean like a slider control - input type="range".  ignore me.
[12:01:30] <taplar> you can go the css approach to make a transition to animate the width change from 1 to 140
[12:01:42] <taplar> or you can go the jQuery route and use animate() to do the same thing
[12:01:46] <taplar> i would suggest the css route
[12:02:09] <tona> let me try to use google to find one example about css route
[12:02:29] <taplar> "css, transitions"
[12:03:07] <taplar> bbs
[12:03:11] <tona> ok
[12:12:55] <thykka> taplar_lunch, protip: use "/away lunch" instead of changing your nick. Then if someone wants to know, they can "/whois taplar" and see that message, instead of having to broadcast it to everyone :)
[12:13:11] <thykka> also, people can do this..
[12:13:16] <robertmaxrees> thykka pretty common practice for people to change their nick ;)
[12:13:17] <taplar> w00t
[12:13:27] <taplar> common, perhaps, but not smart!
[12:13:35] <robertmaxrees> and if you're reg'd, people can only take over your nick for a brief period.
[12:13:58] <thykka> a brief period could be enough for social engineering
[12:14:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:14:43] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the, what, 15 second window isn't enough to do some real damage, especially when your nick change gets broadcasted.
[12:14:44] <thykka> ..presuming they've an account in the first place
[12:14:46] <robertmaxrees> but meh :)
[12:15:32] <thykka> so you'd prefer everyone to announce the nature of their AFK:ness publicly?
[12:15:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying i don't really care either way.
[12:15:55] <thykka> right, well, I do :D
[12:15:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:16:24] <taplar_lunch> ok, that was confusing to come back to
[12:16:52] <thykka> fast lunch :O
[12:17:11] <taplar_lunch> just ran to the bistro to get the food.  eating at my desk
[12:17:25] <decx> yo thykkaplar this taplar_lunch dude is stealing your nick
[12:18:38] <thykka> in ur base, killin ur d00dz
[12:25:12] <tona> taplar, I did it almost pretty close, but I am not getting the same effect , seem the web page fade out after to change or select another position or number, https://jsfiddle.net/hgaeb0uv/
[12:25:55] <taplar_lunch> i'm forgetting it but there should be a css option to make it rewind when it unhovers
[12:27:01] <tona> ok dont worry let me try to find :)
[12:27:17] <robertmaxrees> could also hit up #css for more info :)
[12:28:54] <thykka> that would be the 'transition' property
[12:28:59] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/god4kpw0/  small issue with the background color being lost, but this is closer
[12:29:13] <taplar_lunch> the issue was that the transition was only applied on hover.  you need that to be always applied
[12:29:56] <tona> ok I get it
[12:30:09] <tona> you approach is almost the same :)  thanks Taplar
[12:36:05] <mandude> Hello jquery people
[12:36:51] <robertmaxrees> hello
[12:38:37] <mandude> https://imgur.com/a/FkE6yY4
[12:38:47] <robertmaxrees> oh boy here we go
[12:39:03] <mandude> toptotdisplay div, I need to swap it with the one above it.
[12:39:13] <mandude> $('.uiTaskBarContainer .uiTaskBarTable').append('<div id="toptotdisplay" class="uiTaskBarButton"></div>');
[12:39:15] <mandude> I used .append
[12:39:30] <mandude> But I can't seem to figure out how to make it append not as the last element but 2nd to last
[12:39:31] <taplar_lunch> take a look at the before() method
[12:39:35] <mandude> oh
[12:39:36] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[12:39:43] <mandude> Oh wicked.
[12:40:18] <mandude> taplar_lunch: what do you eat for lunch today?
[12:40:33] <taplar_lunch> tunafish and some veggie pasta stuff
[12:49:31] <mandude> Ok sounds good. Thank you for the method
[12:49:47] <mandude> robertmaxrees: you don't like me? Here we go again? :( That makes me sad.
[12:49:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm allergic to screenshots of code
[12:50:05] <mandude> Oh
[12:50:08] <mandude> It wasn't code.
[12:50:09] <mandude> :)
[12:50:17] <taplar_lunch> it's still less than ideal
[12:50:18] <mandude> Well. But not. But well.
[12:50:23] <robertmaxrees> yes - it was market.
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> *markup
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> you know what I mean.
[12:50:33] <robertmaxrees> this room is sassy af today
[12:50:33] <mandude> You know what I mean too!
[12:50:41] <mandude> let's go play guitar.
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:50:54] <robertmaxrees> see y'all later.
[12:51:03] <mandude> See? He's gonna go do it. I think I will too.
[12:51:17] <mandude> Because I'm just that amazing.
[12:51:22] <RoseBus> it it possible to query by class that _endswith_
[12:51:36] <taplar_lunch> [class$="value"]
[12:51:37] <mandude> hm. I know there is a css selector for ^ starts with
[12:51:43] <mandude> there is a regexc for $
[12:51:45] <mandude> aohh there it is
[12:52:57] <RoseBus> so what if i'm using something like $(row).find('datetime') but i want it to be _id-endswith_ 'datetime'
[12:53:17] <RoseBus> sorry i mean $(row).find('#datetime')
[12:53:37] <taplar_lunch> $(row).find('[id$="datetime"]')
[12:53:42] <RoseBus> omg ty
[12:53:46] <RoseBus> i'm so noob
[12:54:20] <taplar_lunch> or, $('[id$="datetime"]', row)
[12:54:52] <taplar_lunch> which is the $(selector, context) version of the method
[13:03:10] <snatcher> what's the best practice to handle (get/set/toggle) bootstrap colors? most of them has element prefix: btn-primary, alert-primary etc
[13:03:57] <taplar> snatcher in what context?
[13:05:49] <snatcher> taplar: in my case change color for group of elements (buttons, alerts etc) from primary to success
[13:05:58] <taplar> when?
[13:06:10] <snatcher> when press some button
[13:06:36] <taplar> so you would have a click handler on the button that would either toggle the classes or explictly remove the old ones and set the new ones
[13:07:33] <RoseBus> now how could i do an or statement in the above example from taplar
[13:08:24] <snatcher> taplar: >explictly, so there is no _adequate_ way
[13:08:28] <RoseBus> for example if i wanted to match "-datetime" or "-timeofday"
[13:14:07] <taplar> snatcher what do you mean by not adequate way?
[13:14:27] <taplar> RoseBus or statements in selectors are done with the use of commas
[13:14:35] <taplar> "selector1, selector2"
[13:14:38] <RoseBus> taplar, thx
[13:21:36] <snatcher> taplar: something like a: $('.bootstrapcolor-secondary').removeClass('bootstrapcolor-secondary').addClass('bootstrapcolor-info') instead pass to selector every type/color of element: btn-secondary, alert-secondary ... what a mess
[13:22:49] <taplar> Well I mean, you're talking about a very simple method.  It's going to be very granular to allow for the most reuse
[13:38:04] <crs> Hey guys, do you know of any librabry that does counting up to a number, but works for few counters on single page? As in, I want them to finish up at the same time I guess, there are big differences between numbers I want to count to. What I mean is something like that: https://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js/
[13:40:18] <taplar> looks like that library has a duration option
[13:41:27] <crs> ah, so if I set the same duration for all counters I will be fine. Of course! I guess I need to stop looking at screen today. Thanks taplar!
[13:41:42] <taplar> that's my assumption, yeah
[13:48:09] * taplar sings fort minor for robert
[13:56:17] <crs> taplar: I apporeciate that this might not be the best channel for it, but I am struggling with attaching that script to my site. I added that js file to my template and am calling that example they have but get: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: CountUp - error message. I am not sure what that import is and how to adjust it so it works on my site. I bet it's something simple…
[13:56:59] <taplar> got a fiddle?  also, as you say, this is fairly off topic for the room and would be more on topic for ##javascript
[14:09:35] <crs> taplar: cant get codepen to work… https://codepen.io/djll/pen/LYPeRad
[14:20:10] <taplar> crs https://github.com/inorganik/CountUp.js#example-with-vanilla-js
[14:34:10] <crs> taplar: Yes, that import errors in my browser
[14:34:43] <taplar> i was able to get it to run in the codepen, changing the url to be the cdn url
[14:36:08] <crs> url in import
[14:36:31] <crs> ?
[14:36:35] <taplar> yes
[14:37:15] <crs> It gives me SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'. import call expects exactly one argument.
[14:38:57] <crs> ah yeah, it works on codepen… I have it in <script> block, that can't change anything, can it
[14:39:24] <taplar> ?
[14:40:52] <crs> taplar: http://i.imgur.com/0qwFG0B.png
[14:41:23] <taplar> is that error from codepen?
[14:41:38] <crs> No, my site, it works on code pen…
[14:41:57] <taplar> ah, dunno what to do about that.  ##javascript might be able to tell you more
[14:42:25] <crs> taplar: OK, thanks for trying! Appreciated.
[14:54:00] <shoky> crs: try adding type="module" to the <script> tag
[15:02:50] <crs> shoky: Exactly, it fixed it. Was just about to give an answer here, someone helped on javascript.
