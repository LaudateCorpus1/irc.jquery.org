[04:41:17] <blinky_> Hi all, I am using this script to send a value across to a php page.  I know that th script works, however, I am trying to send the value to a page loaded within a page and I believe that the value is being sent to the main page.  Is there any way of changing the script so as to send it to the page within the page (Page loaded into a div)? - http://pastebin.com/Gk5nkNSe

[07:08:29] <martin-_-> hi
[07:09:26] <martin-_-> i got a div named #content in this div are many tables. some tables contains rows with input fileds or/and select elemtns
[07:09:53] <martin-_-> how can i select input or and select withing jquery().find(input or select)
[07:09:55] <martin-_-> ?
[07:12:42] <JJay> hi
[07:16:52] <JJay> Hello
[07:17:19] <toothrot> martin-_-, you can use multiple selectors e.g. $('div, p')
[07:18:00] <martin-_-> ah thanks toothrot
[07:20:32] <JJay> I have timer set to change every 0.1 second text shadow, it's not working and chrome doesn't show any errors
[07:32:18] <vol4ko> hello guys
[07:32:34] <vol4ko> If i have 5 divs in one cotainer with same class(all the 5 divs)
[07:32:45] <vol4ko> how can i select only one on click
[07:32:50] <vol4ko> but not them all
[07:33:07] <vol4ko> is it possible with jquery?
[07:34:29] <rai> vol4ko: ev.target
[07:37:06] <vol4ko> i made it with $(this).children("neededTag")
[07:43:37] <codecutter> does replaceWith detach element from dom? I seem to have noticed i am unable to get a reference to the element after calling this function.. e..g $('.foo').replaceWith(bar); $('.foo') is now null.
[07:44:46] <codecutter> is this behaviour correct?
[07:53:35] <vol4ko> is it possible to check when all the names are discovered and break loop http://jsfiddle.net/exekchgL/ cause my for loop is never reached :/
[08:05:02] <krambiorix> hi, how can i evaluate a string like   345.030,23 + 485,09-39 ?
[08:24:09] <KamalKaur> What's the proper way to apply validations with Jquery? Custom or some plugin?
[08:33:29] <Jamesonwa> kamal
[08:33:39] <Jamesonwa> can you explain what exactly you're trying to accomplish
[08:33:44] <Jamesonwa> KamalKaur
[08:36:14] <KamalKaur> Jamesonwa: I've a number of input number fields in which I can enter only numbers. For example in a field called Days, I want that the user can only enter a number from 1-30 if it's a 30 days month.. from 1-31 if it's 31 days month and from 1-28 if it's a 28 days month -> Here nothing else can be entered.. no negatives.. no decimals.. So what would be the proper way to do it?
[08:37:09] <KamalKaur> In another field called OT, there can be only digits and decimal umbers... no negatives.. so Should I use regex only? Or what is generally used to do such htings?
[08:38:48] <KamalKaur> Jamesonwa: Or only the custom validations?
[08:38:53] <Jamesonwa> so you want to limit what can be typed into the in input field
[08:39:05] <KamalKaur> Yes
[08:40:59] <Jamesonwa> I think this may help
[08:40:59] <Jamesonwa> http://rustyjeans.com/jquery-plugins/input-limiter
[08:41:25] <Jamesonwa> you will probably use the limitBy method
[08:41:37] <Jamesonwa> function
[08:44:58] <Jamesonwa> Any luck?
[08:45:02] <Jamesonwa> KamalKaur
[08:57:14] <KamalKaur> Jamesonwa: That's not what I asked for
[09:05:46] <Jamesonwa> morning
[09:05:48] <Jamesonwa> KamalKaur
[09:06:03] <Jamesonwa> You'll more then likely need to do some custom if statements and declare the characters to ignore, or allow.
[09:06:19] <KamalKaur> okay
[09:06:28] <Jamesonwa> But you can also do it this way
[09:06:29] <Jamesonwa>  <input type="text" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^*_|]{6,25}" />
[09:06:51] <Jamesonwa> the pattern attribute can be used
[09:07:43] <Jamesonwa> However, to make it very customizeable you will need to do some custom statements
[09:07:58] <Jamesonwa> using jquery selctor and function
[09:08:40] <Jamesonwa> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp
[10:10:57] <martin-_-> got jquery something like a cache?
[10:11:22] <martin-_-> if i do var len = $('.requiredText').length; and then $('.requiredText').each(function(index, element) { will it look up the dom twice?
[10:12:18] <decx> yes
[10:13:10] <martin-_-> ok so its recommended to save the first result in a variable and call on this .each+
[10:13:34] <decx> anytime you use a selector more than once it might as well be cached
[10:19:48] <Hyperking> Can someone help explain what this means? ($(this).prev().length === 0) ? $(this).prev() : $(this).addClass('last')
[10:20:10] <Hyperking> Im sure its a conditional but unsure whats happening
[10:20:38] <decx> (if the element has a sibling before it) ? select this sibling : add a class to the element
[10:20:51] <decx> it's called a ternary
[10:21:09] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[10:21:17] <decx> very handy
[10:21:23] <Hyperking> ahh ternary. thanks
[10:26:40] <iamviknesh> whats wrong with this code http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/2848/ ? i want to create a form fully using jquery . when i click first button it should appear in the document , when i click the second one it should appear as popup (i uses jquery ui widget)

[10:31:54] <Jamesonwa> One second
[10:32:45] <Jamesonwa> iamviknesh
[10:33:06] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: yeah :)
[10:33:13] <Jamesonwa> you need to add a jquery selector/function
[10:33:31] <Jamesonwa> I will help you
[10:33:53] <Jamesonwa> in future you can use jsfiddle.net for posting source code related to html,css, javascript or jquery
[10:34:30] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: thanks :)
[10:34:47] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: i have posted jsfiddle link too
[10:35:12] <Jamesonwa> Okay, so when you click Display as inline button
[10:35:14] <Jamesonwa> you want to display what...
[10:35:33] <Jamesonwa> some text
[10:35:33] <Jamesonwa> ?
[10:35:47] <Jamesonwa> in the document?
[10:36:26] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: i want to display form in the doc , when i click display as popup , i want to display in a popup
[10:36:35] <Jamesonwa> okay one moment
[10:36:49] <Jamesonwa> Do you know jquery selectors?
[10:36:58] <Jamesonwa> Out of curiosity...
[10:37:11] <Jamesonwa> they are simple yet VERY effective
[10:37:29] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: i have used it , did u see my fiddle
[10:37:35] <tharkun> Good $date. I installed the jquery mobile on my dev machine but on the first page i added <script src="../jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script> I get all the data of my SELECT rendered duplicate and I get a message at the bottom of the page "loading" The other "script" I have is the actual jquery.min.js Why am I getting this?
[10:37:40] <Jamesonwa> Oh sorry
[10:37:44] <Jamesonwa> I am not seeing the fiddle
[10:37:49] <Jamesonwa> just HTML
[10:37:54] <Jamesonwa> I will look, my apologies
[10:38:07] <Jamesonwa> AHA
[10:38:10] <Jamesonwa> much more sense thanks
[10:38:13] <iamviknesh> http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/2848/
[10:38:40] <iamviknesh> no problem :)
[10:39:42] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: i just gave the html file , as initially i wrote that , and translated it to be generated using jquery
[10:41:22] <Jamesonwa> So iamvinknesh
[10:41:27] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: i missed "," between the <option> . i added it now , still i dont get
[10:41:33] <Jamesonwa> you need to write your html you want to display seprately
[10:42:24] <krambiorix> hi, how can i evaluate a string like   345.030,23 + 485,09-39 ?
[10:42:26] <Jamesonwa> Im going to delete your jquery and start over
[10:42:34] <Jamesonwa> just type that in console ;-)
[10:42:35] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: so should i write one for popup and one for html ?
[10:43:42] <Jamesonwa> function sum(a,b){ var sumAdd = a+b console.log(sumAdd);};
[10:44:21] <Jamesonwa> sum('345.030,23'+'345.030,23');
[10:44:27] <Jamesonwa> try tthat krambiorix
[10:46:13] <krambiorix> Jamesonwa, but it's not always a sum
[10:46:19] <krambiorix> can be -   or / or *
[10:46:42] <Jamesonwa> i see
[10:48:13] <Jamesonwa> function math(a,b,c){ var doMathAddMinus = a+b-c console.log(doMathAddMinus);};
[10:48:17] <Jamesonwa> marth('345.030,23'+'485,09'-'39');
[10:48:54] <Jamesonwa> lol
[10:49:01] <Jamesonwa> mmath* not marth
[10:49:31] <krambiorix> Jamesonwa, the calculation is a string, how should i make it 'number'+'number' - 'number ?
[10:49:55] <Streemo> how can i target the upload event?
[10:50:15] <Streemo> <input type='file'>
[10:50:26] <Streemo> on click is not what im looking for
[10:51:11] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: any luck ?
[10:51:18] <Jamesonwa> parseInt(x, 10) will be used
[10:51:34] <Jamesonwa> still working iambvinknesh
[10:51:55] <iamviknesh> Jamesonwa: ok np , thanks :)
[10:51:57] <Jamesonwa> I will PM you
[10:53:56] <Streemo> nvm figured it out
[11:02:08] <tharkun> Fixed it upgrading tjquery version.
[11:13:52] <krambiorix> is there a jquery plugin like datepicker but in fact a calculator?
[11:14:43] <doug64k> krambiorix: http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=calculator
[11:43:13] <martin-_-> how can i start this function?             $('html, body').animate({
[11:43:13] <martin-_->         scrollTop: $("#myDiv").offset().top
[11:43:13] <martin-_->     }, 2000); when the debugger is executing the function nothing happens
[11:43:16] <martin-_-> also no error message
[11:46:30] <noober3> @matin-_-, i think you need to try the function to an event, like document.ready
[11:47:19] <noober3> *tie not try
[11:47:41] <martin-_-> i call the function on a click method
[11:48:18] <martin-_-> doesnt i need something like this $("#myDiv")[0].offset().top
[11:54:54] <sacho> no
[11:55:33] <hackal> Hello please may you help me with simple slideToggle and click function? http://jsfiddle.net/4gy63rc7/ I am not able to register the click
[11:56:48] <noober3> @hackal, you need to select the class properly
[11:57:19] <noober3> http://jsfiddle.net/4gy63rc7/1/
[11:59:33] <hackal> noober3: Thank you very much I missed that
[12:00:09] <noober3> np
[12:03:43] <deweydb> is there some reason why element.css({left:'calc(50%+15px)'}) doesn't work?
[12:03:59] <deweydb> can i not do that?
[12:07:44] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:07:47] <rai> deweydb: what's calc and where does it come from
[12:08:04] <deweydb> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc
[12:08:36] <rai> does it work if you use it without jquery?
[12:08:47] <deweydb> in pure css yes
[12:08:55] <rai> what about .style
[12:08:55] <deweydb> even adding a class that has the exact same rule works
[12:09:17] <deweydb> i guess im just going to add remove a class instead
[12:09:30] <deweydb> it seems weird that you can't set that one css rule with jquery though
[12:22:13] <deweydb> oh shit
[12:22:18] <deweydb> it needs a frigging space
[12:22:20] <deweydb> what the heck
[12:22:29] <deweydb> element.css({left:'calc(50% + 15px)'})
[12:22:35] <deweydb> works
[12:32:24] <Baako> hi guys dont know if this the right channel but
[12:33:01] <Baako> You know in gmail you can drag and drop a file and it get uploaded is that done via javascript or jquery?
[12:36:07] <Baako> if yes how do u use it please
[12:42:22] <codecutter> if I comment out line 10 then line 9 inserts otherwise not, why? http://pastebin.com/Rq15e28V
[12:42:59] <codecutter> line 47 seems to be the offending line.
[12:43:12] <Hyperking> what is the diff between using var $foo = bar and var foo = bar ?
[12:48:01] <rhp> Hyperking, there shouldn't be a difference other than the variable name. The $variable notation seems to be used to designate a jQuery object, but it's not mandatory
[12:48:10] <codecutter> Hyperking: folsk sometimgs $foo to indicate its an array or a dom..
[12:48:38] <codecutter> folks sometimes use*
[12:48:58] <codecutter> or a jq object :)
[12:49:17] <Hyperking> codecutter: gotcha..the $foo is tied to an array object
[12:59:35] <doug64k> deweydb: is the element positioned? (or did you find the solution already)
[12:59:51] <deweydb> solution was adding a space in that rule
[12:59:56] <doug64k> deweydb: left may have no effect
[13:00:03] <deweydb> calc(50%+15px) = no work
[13:00:05] <deweydb> calc(50% + 15px) = works
[13:00:17] <doug64k> ah lol
[13:01:02] <doug64k> css--
[13:03:56] <deweydb> yeah for realz
[13:04:01] <deweydb> 30 minutes i'll never get back
[13:13:45] <Hyperking> Need help determining why my a element will not be selected? http://plnkr.co/edit/s6CcZPvSQvUQGjewkh3h
[13:14:37] <Hyperking> calling .prev() should get the previous li a element correct?
[13:15:17] <Hyperking> or do i simply call $(this).parent().prev()
[13:15:30] <wa5ted> first one
[13:15:33] <wa5ted> i think sohuld work
[13:15:35] <wa5ted> console.log stuff
[13:15:39] <wa5ted> Hyperking: ^
[13:22:26] <Hyperking> wa5ted: when my structure follows li > a > a it works but not with li >a li > a
[13:23:21] <Hyperking> the $(this).prev() may need to be $(this).parent().prev('a')
[13:27:46] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: Why do you have nested <a>s?
[13:28:45] <Hyperking> I don't, BillCriswell http://plnkr.co/edit/s6CcZPvSQvUQGjewkh3h?p=preview
[13:29:19] <BillCriswell> then li > a > a wouldn't be selecting anything.
[13:29:44] <wa5ted> Hyperking: probably
[13:29:50] <wa5ted> and that was my question
[13:29:56] <wa5ted> no fair BillCriswell stealing my questions
[13:30:10] <BillCriswell> It's all you.
[13:30:18] <wa5ted> im joking yo
[13:30:21] <wa5ted> whats up man
[13:30:26] <Hyperking> sorry it was more like li > a, a , a
[13:30:27] * tw2113 takes away BillCriswell's dessert
[13:30:42] <BillCriswell> Dang.
[13:31:00] * tw2113 secretly passes it back under the table
[13:31:10] <Hyperking> its a list of images that im attempting to build a lightbox carousel
[13:32:07] <BillCriswell> Recruiters called my work number. Pretty ballsy move.
[13:32:17] <BillCriswell> Left a message with a PM lol
[13:32:41] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: lol
[13:32:46] <wa5ted> wha are they recruiting for
[13:33:29] <BillCriswell> Probably some role I'm not suitable for. That tends to be the case with dumb ones.
[13:34:02] <BillCriswell> Er, s/dumb/rude
[13:34:49] <wa5ted> lol
[13:35:03] <wa5ted> i get tons of those from some talent agencies i went to see a few months ago
[13:36:35] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Yeah. I get lots of emails and a fair amount of calls to my cell but calling my work is terrible form.
[13:36:39] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: say there is a div with fixed position, is there anyway to create a boolean to change the color of the text of the div depending on the body's backgorund color
[13:36:47] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: yes it is
[13:37:06] <wa5ted> btw reason i need to detect background color is esp when im scrolling
[13:37:12] <wa5ted> http://rohan.bhangui.com/gemma/
[13:37:48] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: example ^, the menu on the right side must change according to the background color upon which it sits
[13:39:39] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I think I'm following but not well.
[13:39:53] <wa5ted> well starting click the menu at the side
[13:40:04] <wa5ted> see how the color of the menu changes from white to dark gray
[13:40:13] <wa5ted> when the background goes from the dark picture to the white background
[13:40:15] <wa5ted> ?
[13:40:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:42:23] <BillCriswell> Oh you want to do this. I thought you were showing me it and wanted another way.
[13:43:10] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: This is probably just modifying a class based on where the user it scrolled to. I doubt it's detecting the background color behind it and switching.
[13:43:52] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: say the background does not alternate between dark and white, hence the detection
[13:44:10] <wa5ted> is there a way to do the detection
[13:45:45] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Think you lost me again.
[13:45:52] <wa5ted> lol
[13:45:55] <wa5ted> what part
[13:47:54] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I think the "detection".
[13:48:06] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: did you paly with the menu
[13:48:08] <wa5ted> play
[13:48:11] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:48:13] <wa5ted> notice how the menu color changes
[13:48:16] <BillCriswell> Yes
[13:48:30] <wa5ted> why does it change?
[13:48:37] <wa5ted> cause the background is different color right?
[13:49:57] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: No. This site in particular is just switching the color of the menu after the user scrolls past a certain point.
[13:50:06] <wa5ted> yes
[13:50:08] <wa5ted> i know
[13:50:13] <wa5ted> for now ive done it this way
[13:50:27] <wa5ted> im wondering if there is a way to detect background color so that the menu changes color automatically
[13:51:03] <faryshta> hi, i have  a form with many fields, i want to keep most of them hidden until someone focus on the form. is there a way to do this?
[13:51:28] <wa5ted> .on focus event
[13:51:31] <wa5ted> faryshta: ^
[13:51:47] <faryshta> wa5ted, but the <form> can't get the focus
[13:52:10] <wa5ted> but the input fields that are present in the form that dont need to be hidden
[13:52:14] <wa5ted> can be given that event
[13:52:19] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I'm sure it's possible but that wouldn't give you a lot of control over the actual color.
[13:52:56] <faryshta> wa5ted, is there a way to do it on the form so i can replicate it more easily?
[13:53:00] <wa5ted> im just curious how it would be done
[13:53:03] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: ^
[13:53:17] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: care to chime in on faryshta question
[13:54:26] <faryshta> wa5ted, also i want the hidden elements to hidea again on 'blur' if i use focus/blur on each input element it will be a nightmare when the user start filling the form
[13:55:01] <BillCriswell> faryshta: Are they just kind of tabbing through these inputs in the dark?
[13:55:14] <faryshta> BillCriswell, what do you mean?
[13:55:52] <BillCriswell> faryshta: If you have a bunch of forms and they're all hidden besides the one that's focused how are they getting to these other forms inputs/
[13:56:14] <wa5ted> lol
[13:56:41] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Something like http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/ could help, and you can use a color plugin to get opposites, but it dosn't help you much when the bakground has a lot of radical differences in colors.
[13:56:43] <faryshta> BillCriswell, one form shows two inputs 'name' and 'email'
[13:57:23] <faryshta> BillCriswell, then when the user click/hover/focus or something like that (any other event could work) on those elements the other elements show up
[13:57:34] <faryshta> like 'phone' for example
[13:58:01] <Hyperking> is w3 schools down??
[13:58:10] <Hyperking> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_traversing_descendants.asp
[13:58:11] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: That would be nice.
[13:58:34] <BillCriswell> faryshta: Where did phone come from?
[13:58:47] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: not for me, still trying to travese the dom tree
[13:58:56] <faryshta> BillCriswell, same form, it was just with 'display:none'
[13:59:30] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: It is not loading for me
[13:59:33] <wa5ted> BillCriswell:  thatnks
[13:59:34] <wa5ted> thanks
[13:59:46] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: No problem.
[13:59:47] <faryshta> BillCriswell, a bit like this <form><input name="name"><input name="email><input name="phone" class="show-focus-only"></form>
[14:00:01] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: w3schools or my plunkr ?
[14:00:11] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: w3schools.
[14:00:44] <BillCriswell> faryshta: You can do .show-focus-only { display: none; } .show-focus-only:focus { display: inline-block; } (if I'm following right).
[14:01:10] <faryshta> BillCriswell, but then how will they focus on a hidden element on the first place?
[14:01:29] <wa5ted> Hyperking: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[14:01:41] <faryshta> i need something like form:focus .show-focus-only {display:inherit}
[14:01:42] <BillCriswell> faryshta: oh sorry I get it now.
[14:08:54] <BillCriswell> faryshta: http://jsbin.com/caceqaliva/1/edit?html,js,output can work.
[14:10:59] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/caceqaliva/2/edit?js,output
[14:11:38] <faryshta> BillCriswell, looks like it might, how about blur?
[14:14:08] <faryshta> BillCriswell, i made a modification, how do i save it to show you?
[14:16:03] <BillCriswell> faryshta: If the url has /3 it should be updated.
[14:21:17] <BillCriswell> faryshta: http://jsbin.com/caceqaliva/3/edit?js,output there you go.
[14:21:54] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: http://prntscr.com/52g1n4
[14:22:03] <wa5ted> they look good now
[14:22:10] <wa5ted> but at smaller sizes they suck :(
[14:22:10] <BillCriswell> Lookin snazzy.
[14:23:16] <wa5ted> http://prntscr.com/52g28q
[14:23:19] <BillCriswell> I'm sure you'll figure something out.
[14:23:20] <wa5ted> thats at 16 px
[14:24:06] <BillCriswell> I think they look fine.
[14:24:20] <wa5ted> kk thanks :)
[14:29:41] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: i selecting a few people as early adopters i plan to release the set soon, love if you could test it out and try to use it give me feedback cool?
[14:30:12] <BillCriswell> Sounds good. Hopefully I can find a project to use them with.
[14:30:30] <wa5ted> yeah cool thanks let you know when its up
[14:33:58] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[14:34:01] <wa5ted> hi
[14:34:11] <giuseppesolinas> can I get help for something? I can't figure out
[14:34:34] <giuseppesolinas> I'm developing a website for mobile devices and I need to disable touchmove on certain conditions by setting preventDefault, but when I try to re-enable it it doesn't restore
[14:41:28] <wa5ted> giuseppesolinas: hmmmmmm
[14:41:37] <wa5ted> can you perhaps recreate the porblem ina fiddle
[14:41:43] <wa5ted> problem in a fiddle *
[14:42:15] <giuseppesolinas> wa5ted, perhaps
[14:45:56] <wa5ted> giuseppesolinas: then perhaps i might be able to help you :p
[14:46:00] <wa5ted> fiddle it ill take a look
[16:03:35] <giuseppesolinas> wa5ted, I solved, thank you
[16:04:08] <giuseppesolinas> as usual it was a misplaced line in a place I wasn't looking at
[16:04:34] <giuseppesolinas> btw does anyone know how to animate smoothly o ios safari?
[16:08:04] <wa5ted> giuseppesolinas: are you using jquery to animate
[16:08:05] <wa5ted> ?
[16:10:39] <giuseppesolinas> wa5ted, yes
[16:10:45] <wa5ted> there is your issue
[16:10:55] <wa5ted> if you use css animations youll get better performance
[16:11:03] <wa5ted> just use .addClass method
[16:11:07] <wa5ted> and then use transitions
[16:11:12] <giuseppesolinas> basically I'm adding a class via jquery and the children elements scale accordingly
[16:11:35] <giuseppesolinas> yes, exactly
[16:11:37] <giuseppesolinas> lol
[16:14:20] <giuseppesolinas> wa5ted,  that's basically what I'm doing but the animations keep sucking in in one unacceptable way
[16:14:31] <wa5ted> lol
[16:14:44] <giuseppesolinas> :D
[16:15:49] <giuseppesolinas> actually the little animations I do with jquery alone behave just as well as on desktop
[16:22:31] <mchelen1> how do i test if the object returned by $.getJSON is valid? i had some .json with an extra , in the wrong place
[16:24:07] <mchelen1> oh i see the .error()
[16:27:04] <mchelen1> err .fail() now
[16:41:46] <Hyperking> been at this for hours..need another approach
[16:42:20] <Hyperking> i have a list of 4 images that need to become an array
[16:42:46] <decx> did you use $.map?
[16:44:50] <Hyperking> like this ?? $('.gallery li a').map()
[16:45:29] <decx> maybe reading that $.map documentation would help
[16:47:54] <Hyperking> decx: $.map($('gallery li a')) returns [] should have 4 a elements
[16:49:28] <decx> so you did not read the map documentation ^^
[16:50:37] <decx> var arr = $('.images').map(function(){ return this.src });
[16:50:45] <Hyperking> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/  no examples of using an array from a selector
[16:54:54] <shoky> `api map @ Hyperking
[16:54:54] <b-ot> Hyperking: .map(): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[17:16:21] <uskerine> Hi, how should I refer to the third element of "month": {"foo":{"year":{"4":150,"10":56,"21":351},"quarter":[{},{},{},{"4":150,"10":56,"21":351}],"month":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"21":45},{"4":75,"10":56,"21":306},{"4":75}]}
[17:26:09] <harrisonn> if i do a $("#div_content").load('input.html'); that just puts say an input into the div
[17:26:19] <harrisonn> how do i turn that input into a selectmenu?
[17:26:45] <harrisonn> i thought i'd just call a function right after the .load that called initializeDiv()
[17:27:04] <harrisonn> and all it does is $(#input_id).selectmenu(...)
[17:27:07] <uskerine> why data.foo.month[2] over objec data   =
[17:27:08] <harrisonn> but that doesn't seem to work
[17:27:11] <uskerine> {"foo":{"year":{"4":150,"10":56,"21":351},"quarter":[{},{},{},{"4":150,"10":56,"21":351}],"month":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"21":45},{"4":75,"10":56,"21":306},{"4":75}]}
[17:27:48] <uskerine>  why data.foo.month[2] does not work?   (data contains the above JSON object)
[17:28:39] <Velveeta> are you just referencing data.foo.month[2], or are you referencing like data.foo.month[2].something ?
[17:30:31] <uskerine> I think your question made me see what I am doing wrong
[17:30:38] <uskerine> I am getting the whole object at month[2]
[17:35:17] <Velveeta> well, i'm not copy/pasting/indenting that thing, just skimming it, but that *looks* like a valid path to me, as long as you're not dereferencing anything off of that empty object path
[17:42:09] <uskerine> I think it is fine, I was getting [object Object] because if I understood it properly, I am getting things like {"4":150, "10":56, "21":251}
[17:42:40] <uskerine> now I am trying to turn that into text like: 150 (4%)\n 56 (10%)\n 251 (21%)
[17:42:50] <uskerine> I tried this: http://pastebin.com/Vqckv39f but it is not working
[17:45:00] <uskerine> specifically, I am getting:      jquery.min.js (line 6) SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
[18:50:25] <quackgyver> Hi. I'm new to jQ. How can I make something happen every time a condition is true? It seems to me that events only fire the first time it's true?
[18:52:04] <wa5ted> quackgyver: can you draw up a fiddle
[18:52:06] <wa5ted> with your context
[18:52:12] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net
[18:52:18] <Jamesonwa> Im happy to help with a source ref
[18:52:33] <quackgyver> wa5ted: jsfiddle won't load for me
[18:52:38] <Jamesonwa> oh thats right
[18:52:44] <Jamesonwa> i was having issues with js fiddle earlier
[18:52:54] <quackgyver> There we go.
[18:52:54] <quackgyver> http://jsfiddle.net/9t64t0x1/
[18:52:56] <quackgyver> This is my code.
[18:53:07] <excesseye> ™
[18:53:11] <quackgyver> How can I make it alert *every* time these conditions are true?
[18:53:17] <wa5ted> quackgyver:
[18:53:22] <wa5ted> lets go through that
[18:53:27] <wa5ted> do you know when that code fires?
[18:53:36] <quackgyver> Yes, once, when true.
[18:53:41] <wa5ted> or false
[18:53:46] <wa5ted> im not asking how it fires
[18:53:49] <Jamesonwa> you want to loop
[18:53:49] <wa5ted> im asking when
[18:53:54] <wa5ted> Jamesonwa: i got this
[18:53:54] <quackgyver> Jamesonwa: Alright.
[18:54:02] <wa5ted> want to see if he understands whats going on
[18:54:03] <quackgyver> wa5ted: No you don't. Stop trying to play teacher.
[18:54:04] <Jamesonwa> if you want it to run multiple times
[18:54:05] <quackgyver> Ignored.
[18:54:15] <quackgyver> Jamesonwa: Alright cool, thanks.
[18:54:16] <wa5ted> quackgyver: its firing on document ready
[18:54:22] <wa5ted> you need a resize window event
[18:54:26] <wa5ted> there you go
[18:54:57] <Jamesonwa> you can try a for loop would be my advice
[18:55:13] <wa5ted> Jamesonwa: he needs o fire it on resize
[18:55:20] <Jamesonwa> ah
[18:55:40] <quackgyver> Jamesonwa: Is there a simple way to make some kind of conditional loop in jQ?
[18:55:51] <quackgyver> I'd like to keep it simple if possible.
[18:56:46] <wa5ted> quackgyver: if you had listened to me
[18:57:01] <wa5ted> then you would know targetting the window with a .on resize event would work
[18:57:12] <Jamesonwa> ./\
[18:57:23] <wa5ted> if you wanna run it the entire way through
[18:57:32] <wa5ted> then run your if statement through a setInternval
[18:57:34] <wa5ted> Interval
[18:58:18] <quackgyver> wat
[18:58:45] <quackgyver> Jesus, I'm looking at some code examples and it's a total mess.
[18:58:46] <wa5ted> quackgyver: when do you want the even to fire
[18:59:03] <wa5ted> when you resize the window or every X number of seconds
[18:59:03] <Jamesonwa> wa%sted, it appears he wants it to fire
[18:59:04] <quackgyver> A full block of scrunched inline code just to determine what size the browser window is
[18:59:23] <quackgyver> This is insane.
[18:59:23] <Jamesonwa> if window width is less the 960 px
[18:59:37] <wa5ted> Jamesonwa: first of all he hasnt even loaded jquery
[18:59:41] <Jamesonwa> yeah
[18:59:48] <Jamesonwa> he's got no library specified in the jsfiddle
[18:59:59] <RaptorJesus> hullo
[19:00:12] <RaptorJesus> dogetopia.net how do I make doge move across the bottom?
[19:00:14] <quackgyver> Whatevs. This is too convoluted. I'll just drop jQ.
[19:00:21] <Jamesonwa> quack
[19:00:24] <Jamesonwa> tis not
[19:00:25] <RaptorJesus> coin
[19:00:25] <Jamesonwa> very simple
[19:00:53] <wa5ted> Jamesonwa: im thinking he wasnt a programmer
[19:01:05] <Jamesonwa> me too ;-)
[19:01:16] <RaptorJesus> Jamesonwa, can you simply help me move doge across the bottom and start over from the left when it reaches the right side of the view port?
[19:01:49] <Jamesonwa> lol

[19:02:34] <wa5ted> that guy was a moron
[19:02:44] <wa5ted> RaptorJesus: do a css transition
[19:02:44] <Jamesonwa> Well, uneducated, yes
[19:03:03] <RaptorJesus> i was looking at the jquery animate function
[19:03:15] <wa5ted> RaptorJesus: it will come out smoother if you set up classes
[19:03:22] <wa5ted> and then use jquery .addClass
[19:03:25] <wa5ted> when you wanna animate
[19:03:44] <wa5ted> smoother across desktop and mobile
[19:03:55] <RaptorJesus> any examples?

[19:06:56] <wa5ted> RaptorJesus: well a bit of both
[19:07:05] <wa5ted> set up transitions
[19:07:10] <wa5ted> and then use .addClass

[20:04:35] <Mark____> that’s not the same js though is it?
[20:04:59] <Jamesonwa> What do you mean
[20:05:47] <Mark____> the fiddle you cited uses separate javascript coding
[20:05:58] <Mark____> so i figured it’s not exactly the same coding
[20:06:24] <Jamesonwa> You mean because it's all separated? and not in one file?
[20:06:30] <Mark____> yes.
[20:06:44] <Jamesonwa> This is because its using CSS, Javascript and HTML
[20:06:57] <Mark____> uh ah
[20:07:05] <Jamesonwa> what...?
[20:07:09] <Mark____> uh huh
[20:07:10] <Mark____> *
[20:07:18] <Jamesonwa> this is exactly what you're doing....
[20:07:24] <Mark____> i know.
[20:07:39] <Mark____> thanks for the help
[20:07:55] <Jamesonwa> Not to difficult from here on out.
[20:08:00] <Jamesonwa> Style it up and good to go
[20:08:47] <Velveeta> mark: what are the <!-- %import()--> statements?
[20:09:09] <Jamesonwa> he's commenting out the source files
[20:09:11] <Jamesonwa> to fancy input
[20:09:19] <Mark____> yeah, one more question though:
[20:09:32] <Mark____> do you know how it supports foreign language beside English?
[20:09:44] <Jamesonwa> yes
[20:09:45] <Mark____> I typed in some foreign letters and it comes out badly.
[20:09:53] <Jamesonwa> any language in specifc?
[20:09:56] <Mark____> Korean
[20:09:59] <Jamesonwa> you need to use a different encoding
[20:10:11] <Mark____> mind if i ask how do i do that?
[20:11:56] <Jamesonwa> You will need to add regex for korean
[20:12:45] <Mark____> hmm, can you be a little bit more speciic..? i don’t know where to start.
[20:12:48] <Jamesonwa> var hangul = new RegExp("[\u1100-\u11FF|\u3130-\u318F|\uA960-\uA97F|\uAC00-\uD7AF|\uD7B0-\uD7FF]")
[20:12:56] <Jamesonwa> you will need to run a function for that
[20:13:03] <Jamesonwa> and define the character input
[20:13:09] <Mark____> sounds insanely difficult.
[20:13:15] <Velveeta> you can try starting here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16945681/how-to-get-korean-language-characters-to-display-on-a-website
[20:13:19] <Jamesonwa> Sounds like you need a paid developer
[20:13:50] <Jamesonwa> But what if someone types english?
[20:14:22] <Mark____> lol
[20:14:25] <Velveeta> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:14:29] <Mark____> sigh..
[20:14:32] <Mark____> thanks both of you.
[20:14:36] <Jamesonwa> Mark.. you will want to use something similar to this
[20:14:37] <Jamesonwa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19921724/want-to-limit-korean-and-chinese
[20:14:55] <Mark____> that sounds so racist, but i will try it.
[20:15:41] <Jamesonwa> Mark do you have any budget for a developer on this project?
[20:16:55] <Mark____> it’s not exactly a project.
[20:17:25] <Mark____> im just trying to set up my own webdesign company
[20:18:03] <Mark____> just needs small portfolio webpage that looks awesome.
[20:25:56] <Yahkob> anyone have any ideas how you could prevent somebody from using your app and just typing $('button').click() on 100 different buttons? to just allow one button at one time
[20:27:08] <Yahkob> my first thought was to write the click handler externally then use a throttle function but that doesnt work if someone presses every button at the same time :]
[20:33:13] <wa5ted> Yahkob: i got an idea
[20:33:16] <wa5ted> take a look at this
[20:33:19] <wa5ted> might give you a hint
[20:33:38] <wa5ted> Yahkob: http://discovercoolprogramming.blogspot.ca/
[20:33:44] <wa5ted> take a look at the une 2nd post
[20:33:57] <Yahkob> for a second i thought you said take a look at this like they keyword "this"
[20:33:58] <Yahkob> lol
[20:34:08] <wa5ted> lol
[20:34:11] <Yahkob> but thanks ill check it out !
[20:34:17] <wa5ted> basically its an animation throttler i wrote
[20:35:07] <wa5ted> Yahkob: hope that code helps
[20:35:09] <Yahkob> ah cool
[20:35:14] <Yahkob> ill let ya know tomorrow
[20:35:30] <Yahkob> its funny this was a project i started the first month i learned to code just revisited it
[20:35:51] <Yahkob> needless to say it was horrible and unmaintainable code :)
[20:36:27] <wa5ted> lol
[21:22:43] <Fishy> Can i not do this? $('.someclass').css({height: $(this).parent().height() - $(this).siblings().outerHeight()});
[21:24:33] <Woet> Fishy: i don't know, can you?
[21:24:49] <Fishy> Woet: looks like no.. $(this) doesnt seem to work
[21:25:33] <Woet> well, yes, it's just a variable in an object
[21:25:50] <Woet> i assume you're trying to refer to .someclass?
[21:26:05] <Fishy> yes
[21:26:49] <Woet> are you sure you need to use JS for this? instead of CSS
[21:27:01] <Fishy> yes
[21:27:15] <tuskkk___> ('#user-form select, #user-form input').change(function(){, what are 'select' and 'input'?
[21:27:32] <Woet> tuskkk___: elements. <select> and <input>
[21:27:33] <Woet> Fishy: how so?
[21:28:17] <shoky> Fishy: $('.someclass').css('height', function(){ return $(this).parent().height() - ...; })
[21:29:10] <tuskkk___> Woet: but then how to say, when the field is selected or something is inputted on the form?
[21:29:22] <tuskkk___> then change...
[21:32:38] <Woet> tuskkk___: http://api.jquery.com/change/ http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:34:04] <Fishy> Woet: hmmmm
[21:34:08] <tuskkk___> Woet: but then they are not elements right?
[21:36:40] <Fishy> Woet: it seems to be working but the height isnt updating
[21:37:18] <Woet> Fishy: did you mean shoky?
[21:38:58] <Fishy> Woet: fixed it.. thanks for the help
[21:57:54] <tuskkk___> what is this line doing?
[21:57:57] <tuskkk___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/A1j5krn5
[21:59:00] <Woet> tuskkk___: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/ http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[21:59:50] <tuskkk___> Woet: I am already reading them, it would be great if you could simplify it
[22:00:20] <Woet> tuskkk___: i can't simplify 2 sentences.
[22:00:32] <tuskkk___> nevermind
[22:08:29] <P0rk> using jquery,. how does one set the value of a select element?
[22:17:47] <Jamesonwa> var text = "some text" ;
[22:17:50] <Jamesonwa> $( "input" ).val( text );
[22:18:54] <Jamesonwa>   $( "input" ).val( text );p0rk
[22:19:03] <Jamesonwa> whoops
[22:19:09] <Jamesonwa> p0rk
[22:34:36] <P0rk> jamesonwa, that's almost a select element, isn't it.
[22:34:51] <P0rk> $("select").val(something not in options)?
[22:35:18] <P0rk> or do you set the selected option index for the select
[22:37:49] <tuskkk___> anyone knows about yii ajax form validation?
[22:38:00] <tuskkk___> need to remove those errors on change, click or focus
[22:41:37] <P0rk> $("select").val(opt) works if opt is in options. If not, it appears blank.. I want to be able to selefct "other" and manually enter an option. Any ideas?
[22:46:33] <aro> does anyone know how to prevent BS3 from caching modal crap
[23:43:23] <Red_Onyx> #raspberrypi,
[23:43:28] <Red_Onyx> sorry
[23:43:34] <Red_Onyx> forgot to type /join
[23:54:52] <Mark_____> anybody who can get this thing working on jsfiddle? http://dropthebit.com/demos/fancy_input/fancyInput.html
