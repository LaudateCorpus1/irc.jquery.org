[00:04:17] <amtrivedi> Hello everyone,
[00:04:35] <amtrivedi> I want to create a HTML div on the fly
[00:04:42] <amtrivedi> Here is the paste -
[00:04:43] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/3F3TNQE
[00:05:02] <amtrivedi> I am following this SO link -
[00:05:02] <amtrivedi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1867098/javascript-creating-div-on-the-fly
[00:05:59] <amtrivedi> What is wrong in my current code?
[00:06:15] <Cork> amtrivedi: just a sidenote you can simplify $("<option></option>") to $("<option>")
[00:06:51] <amtrivedi> Cork: Oh, it would work with just <option> ?
[00:06:56] <Cork> and as long as all the data in there is valid it should work just fine
[00:07:14] <Cork> amtrivedi: yes, jquery to handle <tag name> strings
[00:07:22] <Cork> (it isn't parsed as html)
[00:07:30] <amtrivedi> Cork: Ohkay, so I guess I can do same with the div as well?
[00:07:57] <Cork> no, there you're appending a string
[00:07:58] <Cork> and it should be a valid html string
[00:08:07] <Cork> the difference is that line 36 is creating a dom element
[00:08:15] <Cork> then modify its values and THEN appends that element
[00:08:56] <Cork> amtrivedi: i would recommend to change "<div id='preparation'></div>" to '<div id="preparation"></div>' though
[00:09:19] <Cork> as you use '' for strings in most of the js (one selector sticks out)
[00:09:30] <Cork> but ya, check that the code you use actually is correct
[00:09:36] <Cork> the dom modifications looks fine
[00:09:55] <Cork> amtrivedi: i would start by checking that data isn't a string
[00:10:10] <Cork> console.log(typeof(data))
[00:10:20] <amtrivedi> data is JSON.
[00:10:29] <Cork> are you sure?
[00:10:31] <amtrivedi> but lemme confirm it again
[00:10:34] <Cork> also data shouldn't be json
[00:10:37] <Cork> it should be an object
[00:10:52] <Cork> else the server isn't sending json (it sends text)
[00:11:34] <amtrivedi> Yup, it is an object.
[00:11:44] <Cork> and data.name exists?
[00:11:47] <amtrivedi> And I believe it's a JSON object.
[00:11:50] <Cork> (same with data.id)
[00:11:55] <amtrivedi> Yeah they do.
[00:11:59] <Cork> amtrivedi: you're confusing the terms
[00:11:59] <amtrivedi> Sure about them.
[00:12:05] <Cork> {} <-- and object
[00:12:10] <Cork> "{}" <-- a json object
[00:12:24] <Cork> json is always a string, by definition
[00:12:47] <amtrivedi> sorry.
[00:12:58] <amtrivedi> The console statement that you wrote
[00:13:03] <Cork> anyway check console.log(data.name, data.id)
[00:13:06] <amtrivedi> Gives object in console
[00:13:10] <Cork> good
[00:13:27] <Cork> another side note data['id'] === data.id
[00:13:42] <amtrivedi> OKay, thanks.
[00:13:47] <amtrivedi> BTW, data.name
[00:13:50] <amtrivedi> and data.id
[00:13:59] <amtrivedi> Gives the value I submit.
[00:14:12] <Cork> so you get the results you expect?
[00:14:12] <amtrivedi> ( in the popup form )
[00:14:21] <amtrivedi> Yep, exactly.
[00:14:29] <Cork> ok last part then
[00:14:39] <Cork> console.log($('.preparation_select').length) is?
[00:14:56] <amtrivedi> One sec
[00:15:30] <amtrivedi> It gives me 1
[00:15:35] <Cork> hmm
[00:15:40] <Cork> it should work just fine then
[00:15:48] <Cork> i can't see anything wrong anywhere
[00:16:23] <amtrivedi> When I submit the data
[00:16:29] <amtrivedi> I am not getting this -
[00:16:30] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/3F3TNQE#line-9
[00:16:49] <Cork> AH
[00:16:52] <amtrivedi> I mean I want to see this option tad with tha value = data.name
[00:16:52] <Cork> lol
[00:16:58] <Cork> i was only looking at the js
[00:17:04] <Cork> the html is broken
[00:17:12] <Cork> form elements has to have a name
[00:17:27] <Cork> also if select is disabled it won't be included
[00:17:48] <amtrivedi> It is disabled just because I don't want the user to play with it.
[00:17:49] <Cork> and thirdly... don't use event attributes
[00:18:08] <Cork> amtrivedi: then you have to set the value in a hidden field
[00:18:15] <Cork> cause the select element will be ignored
[00:18:51] <amtrivedi> BTW, the select I showed you it is also used for some other purpose as well.
[00:19:01] <amtrivedi> So should I make a new select?
[00:19:07] <amtrivedi> If need be?
[00:19:30] <Cork> <input type="hidden" name="same as for the select" value="default value that should be used when the select is disabled">
[00:19:45] <Cork> and put it right before the select element
[00:20:41] <amtrivedi> Pardon me, but the select I have does not have any name for it.
[00:21:05] <Cork> ya, and that is one of the two reasons why it isn't included in the post
[00:21:16] <Cork> cause sending a value without a name is not possible
[00:21:26] <Cork> but it won't help in it self
[00:21:33] <Cork> as disable will prevent it from getting sent too
[00:22:35] <amtrivedi> So should I make a new select, I don't think I can edit the existing one that much, because as I said earlier it is used for other purposes as well.
[00:22:52] <Cork> amtrivedi: like i said no
[00:23:00] <Cork> read the responses i've given you
[00:23:07] <Cork> it is all in there, twice
[00:23:26] <amtrivedi> Okay
[00:51:50] <parveen> i want to add some variables in URL while passing through ajax call ,  Like  -  http://abc.com/MY_VAR
[00:52:04] <parveen> but if MY_VAR = '1/2/3'
[00:52:08] <parveen> then URL breaks
[00:52:21] <parveen> any solution?
[00:59:09] <Cork> parveen: don't have it in the url, have it as a params string
[00:59:23] <Cork> meaning  http://abc.com/?something=MY_VAR
[00:59:46] <Cork> and if you do that thought the data argument in $.ajax it will encode the characters for you
[00:59:55] <parveen> cant change URL structure now
[01:00:18] <Cork> well you could try url encoding the variable i guess
[01:00:24] <Cork> it will look horrible though
[01:00:54] <Cork> http://abc.com/1%2F2%2F3
[01:00:58] <parveen> i tried  and it URL became something like -   http://abc.com/1%20%2
[01:01:10] <parveen> yes something like that
[01:01:18] <parveen> but still it breaks
[01:01:30] <parveen> while ajax call it treated as  http://abc.com/1/2/3
[01:01:38] <Cork> meaning the server decodes the %2F and accepts it as a path
[01:01:46] <parveen> yes
[01:01:56] <parveen> :(
[01:01:56] <Cork> there isn't much you can do without changing the data format
[01:02:08] <Cork> you could try double encode it
[01:02:18] <Cork> http://abc.com/1%252F2%252F3
[01:02:30] <Cork> or base64 encode it
[01:02:40] <Cork> actually the later might be a better option
[01:02:40] <parveen> hmmm , that could be the solution  ..
[01:03:04] <parveen> let me try to double encode it
[01:03:11] <Cork> http://abc.com/MS8yLzM=
[01:03:21] <Cork> you would have to decode the data in the server though
[01:03:33] <parveen> yes , that it easy :)
[01:03:59] <parveen> Cork , thanks , you saved my day  , Trying now
[01:09:55] <Afdla> how could I add to my ajax call a list of objects with same param names like here: http://jsfiddle.net/nnhjkLpn/
[01:10:44] <Cork> Afdla: $.ajax(url, { data: { list: result_list } })
[01:11:24] <Cork> so http://jsfiddle.net/nnhjkLpn/1/
[01:12:58] <Afdla> Oh, it's that simple
[01:12:58] <Afdla> thanks
[01:13:44] <parveen> Cork : double url encode doesnt work
[01:14:02] <Cork> parveen: so the base64 then
[01:14:04] <parveen> it still decode the URL while ajax request
[01:14:16] <parveen> for base 64 i ll have to add some plugin ?
[01:14:27] <parveen> or is there any inbuit function ?
[01:14:49] <Cork> parveen: nope
[01:14:57] <Cork> ?mdn btoa

[01:16:10] <parveen> Cork : trying now
[01:23:58] <PCatinean> Hey guys, in order to listen on all inputs on a form I tried config_form.on('change', 'input', function(){ but it doesn't trigger
[02:15:53] <PCatinean> Hey guys, if I want to set the parent of a input type radio active and remove it when another radio button is clicked, how do I do that?
[02:17:11] <Meir`> PCatinean, what do you mean by "parent of a input type radio"?
[02:17:17] <Meir`> what's its parent?
[02:18:09] <PCatinean> Meir`, a div or a span basically I have the inputs inside containers and the containers change color
[02:18:29] <PCatinean> and when you pick a radio button it should have a certain background color and another should reset this one and the other should get the background color
[02:19:03] <Meir`> so you want to add an "active" class to the container of the clicked radio button?
[02:19:08] <PCatinean> yes
[02:19:18] <PCatinean> and remove it when another radio button with the same name is picked in the same form
[02:19:19] <Meir`> and the other radio has its own container?
[02:19:27] <Meir`> or you want it only for one of them
[02:19:32] <PCatinean> Yes, every one has it's own container
[02:19:42] <PCatinean> Not sure if it's the best design to approach the problem
[02:23:08] <PCatinean> I mean there's a regular plugin for that or...
[02:24:40] <Meir`> yeah, probably
[02:24:45] <Meir`> but it's a simple script
[02:24:56] <Meir`> PCatinean, i'll set a fiddle for you, 1 sec
[02:25:30] <PCatinean> Meir`, thank you so much, I am able to do it myself but at a very poor quality nontheless, I just read about prop and the debugger hits 4 times for some reason
[02:25:33] <PCatinean> That's why I came in here
[02:26:34] <PCatinean> Meir`, the best case scenario would have been to not have any inputs visible (radio or checkbox) just the parents which are buttons
[02:26:39] <PCatinean> but I'm not sure how that works
[02:28:38] <Meir`> PCatinean, are the radio buttons static?
[02:28:48] <PCatinean> what do you mean? They are dinamically generated
[02:28:50] <Meir`> or can be added dynamically?
[02:28:53] <Meir`> oh
[02:29:08] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/omajijalaf.coffee
[02:30:59] <PCatinean> this is what I have so far
[02:41:20] <Meir`> PCatinean, sorry for the delay. check this: http://jsfiddle.net/uhu9vyax/
[02:42:18] <PCatinean> that's quite shorter than my version Meir` looking cool ,thanks a lot!
[02:42:25] <PCatinean> Is it possible to adapt for inputs regardless of name?
[02:42:44] <PCatinean> also I read somewhere that for checked and stuff like that property should be used instead of attr, does it make a difference?
[02:43:12] <PCatinean> actually attr is not used
[02:44:09] <Meir`> PCatinean, .prop() should replce .attr()
[02:44:14] <Meir`> replace*
[02:44:29] <Meir`> but :checked is a proper jquery selector
[02:44:39] <Meir`> as you can read here: https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[02:45:04] <Meir`> and about the name, it's only for referring to a unique radio group, in case you have several in same page
[02:45:52] <Meir`> i always try to make each of my jquery selectors unique, in case that i later add elements from same type.
[02:46:42] <Meir`> btw, i combined also the "not()" in the selector: http://jsfiddle.net/uhu9vyax/1/
[02:51:20] <Ice_Strike> See http://jsfiddle.net/ww60y38h/
[02:51:31] <Ice_Strike> When tool tip are shown up, if you then click on the background (pink) - it will alert you ID from data-post-id='xx' that has been closed (functionAfter). It is showing the correct ID.
[02:51:50] <Ice_Strike> But .. instead of clicking on the background (pink) and if you click on any other Tips, it will show you incorrect ID. What is causing this and how to fix?
[02:53:50] <Unopoo> I wanna a images upload plugin that support multiple image, image resize and image crop
[02:53:54] <Unopoo> any recommendation?
[03:01:28] <kokut> Hi, how can i select the ::before items inside  my <ul> element?
[03:04:17] <Kartagis> $('ul::before') iirc
[03:04:19] <ekem> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CE0Jp9_WMAI6eZB.png:large
[03:04:36] <PCatinean> Meir`, thanks a lot for your help I will implement it shortly :D
[03:04:43] <PCatinean> looks nice and fresh
[03:06:52] <STFUn00b> hi guys...
[03:06:55] <STFUn00b> quick question
[03:07:09] <STFUn00b> i have dynamic elements that i want to add and later process them
[03:07:19] <STFUn00b> for processing i use jquery's each function
[03:07:24] <STFUn00b> everything works as expected
[03:07:31] <STFUn00b> but... the good old IE9
[03:07:42] <STFUn00b> ignores all dynamic elements completly
[03:07:51] <STFUn00b> any ideas
[03:07:55] <STFUn00b> ?
[03:08:08] <STFUn00b> how can i make IE9 recognize new elements
[03:08:41] <STFUn00b> by the way... i reference new elements by their class name. like so: $('.dynamic-element').each(function() { ... });
[03:12:23] <Cork> STFUn00b: it should work just fine
[03:12:36] <Cork> just make sure you run the selector after the elements has been added
[03:14:03] * ekem salutes STFUn00b, keep up the good fight
[03:14:07] <Ice_Strike> Cork Don't mind checking my jsfiddle?
[03:14:13] <STFUn00b> nop
[03:14:17] <STFUn00b> it doesn't work...
[03:14:30] <STFUn00b> and i run my selector afterwards...
[03:14:38] <STFUn00b> also another funny thing with IE
[03:15:22] <STFUn00b> when i open the console and select the pointer in the console's upper left corner (it's for selecting elements), dynamic elements can't be targeted/selected
[03:15:46] <STFUn00b> and they're not even in the DOM
[03:15:48] <STFUn00b> WTF?
[03:16:12] <Cork> STFUn00b: ya, so you're looking at the wrong place
[03:16:15] <STFUn00b> but... only in IE. Who would've guessed that?!
[03:16:26] <Cork> code exception
[03:16:45] <Cork> an object with a trailing comma for example :) (classic)
[03:17:04] <STFUn00b> sec... let me see.
[03:17:13] <STFUn00b> that could be true.
[03:19:15] <STFUn00b> hmmm
[03:19:18] <STFUn00b> still nothing
[03:19:29] <STFUn00b> removed all trailing commas in objects :\
[03:19:38] <STFUn00b> also, there are no errors in console
[03:20:01] <STFUn00b> funny thing is that element gets displayed normally
[03:20:21] <STFUn00b> but when i inspect DOM in console, element is not there
[03:20:26] <STFUn00b> ?!
[03:20:45] <STFUn00b> any other ideas?
[03:22:44] <STFUn00b> cork can you try this in IE9 http://jsfiddle.net/4SV7n/
[03:23:01] <STFUn00b> someone posted it on stackoverflow
[03:23:13] <STFUn00b> it works fine in other browsers except IE9
[03:43:19] <Cork> STFUn00b: have you tried written valid html?
[03:43:38] <Cork> (<br /> and <input /> only works through error correction)
[03:44:03] <arc_> i don't understand what that means ^
[03:44:22] <Cork> arc_: it means <input> and <br> is valid html
[03:44:32] <Cork> the other is actually xhtml and gets error corrected to the later
[03:44:52] <arc_> what is error correction? the browser automatically changes it?
[03:45:12] <Cork> the browser tries to parse the html, fails and goes into recovery mode
[03:45:23] <Cork> where it tries to error correct the tags to get a valid syntax
[03:45:28] <arc_> i see
[03:45:34] <arc_> thanks
[03:45:52] <arc_> i use those self-closing tags, i quite like it :|
[03:46:11] <Cork> it isn't self closing tags
[03:46:21] <Cork> <input> is a self closing tag
[03:46:33] <arc_> well whatever it's called
[03:46:50] <Cork> ya, many like it
[03:46:58] <Cork> and html5 allows it
[03:47:13] <Cork> but it is actually just wasted bytes
[03:47:14] <ekem> to be on the safe side, ditch the self closers
[03:48:01] <ekem> heres a good description of where it might go wrong
[03:48:02] <ekem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3558119/are-self-closing-tags-valid-in-html5
[03:48:54] <ekem> and from that link is pulled: http://tiffanybbrown.com/2011/03/23/html5-does-not-allow-self-closing-tags/
[03:48:58] <arc_> now i'm wondering why this is written with backslashes
[03:49:14] <arc_> i have never seen that before
[03:49:44] <ekem> the question was just poorly worded, see the first response
[03:50:04] <ekem> in the highest voted response: "If we get the syntax right (it is / not \) then:"
[03:50:09] <ekem> so you have a correction to the question
[03:50:43] <arc_> heh
[03:52:48] <arc_> so basically, using that never matters and sometimes breaks things
[03:53:02] <ekem> yea
[03:53:07] <ekem> especially for ie
[03:53:27] <arc_> disappointing
[03:53:48] <ekem> eh using templating in a framework can save a lot of that effort
[03:53:54] <ekem> and is the direction you probably want to steer
[03:54:08] <STFUn00b> w8
[03:54:26] <STFUn00b> cork what you're saying is that xhtml is not valid html?
[03:54:28] <ekem> but... yeah hypertext markup is pretty old and well you know not perfect
[03:55:02] <ekem> and is interpreted a few ways by each browser, whatever
[03:55:39] <arc_> STFUn00b you have to use an xhtml doctype declaration you can't just use it anytime you want
[03:56:50] <arc_> so no, xhtml is not valid html
[03:59:21] <STFUn00b> allriiiiight
[03:59:25] <STFUn00b> it works
[03:59:29] <STFUn00b> i removed trailing slash
[03:59:44] <STFUn00b> ok
[03:59:46] <STFUn00b> thank you guys
[03:59:55] <STFUn00b> you learn something new every day :)
[04:56:41] <Cork> oh, for crying out loud...
[04:56:50] <Cork> "jsPerf is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." sigh...
[05:07:23] <hellyeah> hey can i ask why addClass doesnt work here i got addClass is not a function http://jsfiddle.net/h87casm5/7/
[05:11:57] <IamTrying> They are using IIyama touch screen. $('button').click(function() {} ); not working but mouse click works. how to make the $('button').click work with touch-screens?
[05:17:09] <Ice_Strike> var content = "<div><textarea id='noteInput'></textarea></div>";
[05:17:25] <Ice_Strike> Using string, how to update the value?
[05:17:49] <Ice_Strike> like $(..).val("Something")
[05:18:36] <Cork> Ice_Strike: don't double post
[05:18:41] <Cork> ask in one channel at a time
[06:20:56] <peterson_> hi, i'm using tabs in my pages, can i link to a particular tab in a page?
[06:23:22] <Cork> peterson_: you can use the #hash_id in the url
[06:23:36] <peterson_> Cork: thanks, i'll google
[06:23:39] <Cork> peterson_: and then on load check for that hash (and bind the hashChange event)
[06:23:57] <peterson_> Cork: ahh, so i have to manually write the jquery for it?
[06:23:59] <Cork> and in that function then run $('selector').tabs('select', id);
[06:24:02] <Cork> yes
[06:24:15] <Cork> it is simple enough though
[06:24:21] <Cork> like 3-4 lines of code
[06:30:18] <DeoSama> Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to fire off an ajax call after a user types 2 characters, is this possible?
[06:38:59] <Agen_Terminator> Hey guys. I think I may be going nuts, and missing something simple. The following stripped down code in the pastie doesn't work for one line (out of 40 odd).  Have a look. I've been staring at this not understanding how one line works differently from the others: http://pastie.org/private/cuu6bfdmt0xyqcnlbcox9q
[06:43:18] <shoky_> Agen_Terminator: maybe there is another element in the DOM with the same ID? (autopost)
[06:47:10] <peterson_> thanks Cork had to step away for a bit - my hd25's just arrived!
[06:47:13] <Agen_Terminator> Hi Shoky_, I've managed to get it working by changing the name from autopost -- it's a parameter in a different function that I didn't think would interfere, but changing it has indeed fixed it. Thanks!
[08:31:42] <ganeshaditya1> Guys I have been studying mediawiki's and phpmyadmin's source code like about 2 months ago. I didn't find them using data attributes of html5. Is there any reason I should refrain from using those functionalitie?
[08:33:18] <shoky_> no
[08:33:44] <ganeshaditya1> @shoky_ was that to my question?
[08:33:51] <shoky_> yep
[08:34:24] <ganeshaditya1> okay !
[08:35:18] <_biff> hi

[08:36:39] <_biff> im using juqery submits...in response i get status codes which would start another php functions...is this a good solutioin to handle this statuscodes in jquery?
[09:13:03] <ganeshaditya1> Guys is there a function that CHANGES the function for onclick event? Currenty I am unbinding and rebinding onclick handlers
[09:14:02] <Zzaichik> soâ€¦. you want a click event that doesn't something other than handle the click event?
[09:14:39] <robertmaxrees> you can't change - only remove and replace.
[09:14:48] <robertmaxrees> or proxy out to the other functions using conditionals.
[09:16:34] <ganeshaditya1> Ohhhoo ..
[10:38:40] <nathesh> Hi
[10:38:58] <nathesh> I have a quick question on AJAX calls
[10:39:35] <nathesh> I am trying to do curl -u username:password -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/authentication/token
[10:39:50] <nathesh> as an AJAX call
[10:40:48] <nathesh> I have this     type: 'GET',     url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/authentication/token',   username: username,      password: password,
[10:40:56] <nathesh> is that wrong?
[10:41:26] <nathesh> or how should I do it?
[10:41:29] <nathesh> thank you
[10:47:11] <nathesh> thank you!
[10:48:17] <nathesh> and this didn't help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10226333/ajax-authentication-with-jquery
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:48:52] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to authenticate?
[10:49:11] <robertmaxrees> because something like http://stackoverflow.com/a/10226409/923919 should work.
[10:50:19] <nathesh> curl -u username:password -i -X GET url
[10:50:28] <nathesh> I am trying to mimick that
[10:51:40] <nathesh> robermaxrees: that is what I am trying to do
[11:00:22] <Ice_Strike> $(this).data('note').text()
[11:00:33] <Ice_Strike> This wont work because I use .text()
[11:00:47] <Ice_Strike> How to treat this as text?
[11:01:02] <Ice_Strike> this may contain doggy text like <script> or so.
[11:02:36] <robertmaxrees> escape it.
[11:03:40] <Ice_Strike> Yes I did using htmlspecialchars() in PHP
[11:03:52] <robertmaxrees> then it should be fine on the frontend.
[11:04:02] <Ice_Strike> and it get added to: data-note=\"$note\"
[11:04:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent basically.
[11:04:19] <Ice_Strike> however, when generating tooltip, it get data from data-note
[11:04:27] <Ice_Strike> and it showing underline and so.
[11:08:10] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees That kinda messed it up lol. Space become %20
[11:08:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:08:45] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to strip html?
[11:09:38] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees in PHP, I have something like this: $note = htmlspecialchars($item['note']);
[11:09:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP.
[11:09:52] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:10:09] <Ice_Strike> and it goes to: data-criteria-note=\"$note\" and output on the browser.
[11:10:26] <Ice_Strike> on the jquery
[11:10:29] <Ice_Strike> I have like this:
[11:10:34] <Ice_Strike> var note = ($(this).data('criteria-note') != '') ? '<b>Note: ' + $(this).data('criteria-note') + "</b>" : '';
[11:10:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not answering my question...
[11:10:42] <Ice_Strike> I am explaining
[11:10:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a one sentence answer :) are you trying to strip html?
[11:11:06] <Ice_Strike> Yes
[11:11:24] <robertmaxrees> awesome - do that server-side.  look for a tool that will strip tags for you.
[11:11:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of relying on JS to do it for you.
[11:11:41] <Ice_Strike> Ok
[11:12:18] <Ice_Strike> in PHP, I have used htmlspecialchars  to Convert special characters to HTML entities
[11:12:31] <Ice_Strike> Some reason, javascript ignore this.
[11:12:43] <Ice_Strike> I will use strip tags :/
[11:12:43] <robertmaxrees> it's not doing what you think it is ;)
[11:12:51] <robertmaxrees> do the safer, saner thing :)
[11:38:37] <ganeshaditya1> hey any idea why this is not working  $this.data('initialized', true);
[11:38:47] <robertmaxrees> how are you checking it?
[11:38:57] <robertmaxrees> if you say the element inspector, that's the wrong way to verify.
[11:39:02] <ganeshaditya1> chrome inspect element
[11:39:06] <ganeshaditya1> damn!
[11:39:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not going to show updates - need to read it back out with .data() :)
[11:39:27] <robertmaxrees> .data() creates/edits a cached version of the data for an element.
[11:42:03] <ganeshaditya1> Wow .. you are awesome man :)
[11:44:00] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[11:45:09] <gambl0re> robertmatrix...
[11:45:18] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re ... again dude?
[11:45:23] <robertmaxrees> you make that same mistake almost every day.
[11:45:38] <gambl0re> look at this site i made... http://street-genie.xyz
[12:17:11] <moparisthebest> does anyone know of a jquery/javascript implementation of the scrypt hashing algorithm?  when I search anything relating to 'scrypt' search engines assume I misspelled 'script'.... :(
[12:17:27] <arc_> put scrypt in quotation marks
[12:17:40] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/tonyg/js-scrypt
[12:17:59] <robertmaxrees> i did a straight search for scrypt javascript and it worked.
[12:18:09] <arc_> me too lol : /
[12:18:12] <moparisthebest> gah I used single quotes out of habit, double quotes worked, thanks :)
[12:18:24] <robertmaxrees> i didn't even need quotes - weird.
[12:18:27] <arc_> bing or yahoo
[12:18:31] <robertmaxrees> google.
[12:18:39] <arc_> i meant the one for whom it isn't working :p
[12:18:44] <robertmaxrees> yahoo and bing are the same engine fwiw.  just different configs ;)
[12:39:29] <choosegoose> I'm writing functionality for certain <input> tags, some of which are rendered in a template so I don't have direct access to the tag attributes themselves. Is it best practice to surround the inputs in containers and use $('.myClass').find('input')?
[12:39:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why not just directly do $('input')?
[12:40:19] <choosegoose> because not all inputs should be selected for what I want to do
[12:40:37] <robertmaxrees> what makes them unique from one another?
[12:40:47] <robertmaxrees> because you could use attributes on them and a .filter()
[12:40:55] <robertmaxrees> or give them unique parent containers.
[12:41:35] <choosegoose> actually they're <textarea>s. in my case I'm adding a "characters remaining" counter to them. But for some of them I might not want that. It might be fine to just put it on all of them...
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> you could also .filter() out the ones with, say, a particular data attribute.
[12:43:15] <choosegoose> I'd have to add that data attribute on the backend then in many cases
[12:43:31] <robertmaxrees> how are you determining the max # of chars in the input?
[12:43:32] <choosegoose> as the template just has {{ form.mytextarea }}
[12:44:58] <choosegoose> thanks, I think I'm good
[12:45:15] <robertmaxrees> err, okay.
[13:01:33] <nathesh_> I had a question on Authorization
[13:01:56] <nathesh_> I am following this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5507234/how-to-use-basic-auth-and-jquery-and-ajax
[13:02:04] <nathesh_> and made an Ajax request
[13:02:19] <nathesh_> however I am getting a 401 error
[13:02:41] <nathesh_> but when I try this in Curl it works perfectly
[13:02:54] <nathesh_> can someone help  me with this?
[13:03:43] <nathesh_> thank you
[13:04:04] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball.
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> weird, i can't see your code.
[13:08:15] <nathesh_> should I pastebin it?
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> bpaste, jsfiddle..
[13:12:30] <robertmaxrees> don't use pastebin - the ads are annoying.
[13:16:37] <nathesh_> Here is the bpaste https://bpaste.net/show/963136d40ea8
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> and you're positive your server is using basic auth?
[13:18:25] <nathesh_> well when I curl -u username:password it works
[13:18:31] <nathesh_> and also I added it to the cors
[13:18:45] <nathesh_> added Authorization
[13:18:54] <robertmaxrees> var hash = Base64.encode(tok);
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> or var auth = btoa('username:password');
[13:20:04] <robertmaxrees> Also: the options preflight that happens might be causing some of your headaches.
[13:20:40] <nathesh_> what is that?
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> read that question some more.
[13:20:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:20:52] <nathesh_> I am using HTTPBasicAuth so yes
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> there are answers that explain it.
[13:21:43] <nathesh_> okay
[13:39:03] <nathesh_> robertmaxrees: The error was I didn't have btoa; (I thought was hashing function)
[13:39:16] <robertmaxrees> figured :)
[13:39:35] <nathesh_> Just wanted to update you; thank you though!
[13:40:04] <robertmaxrees> awesome - definitely.
[13:58:08] <neruda> hi, im trying to understand how to take a value selected from an autocomplete-enabled input and add it to another input
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting hung up on?
[13:58:30] <neruda> example: https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/AdvancedSearch     <-- in the location tab here its done
[14:01:10] <neruda> robertmaxrees: being a javascript noob, im not sure what the syntax is for accessing the selected element and i dont get where its being stored
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery ui?\
[14:03:10] <neruda> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:03:49] <neruda> robertmaxrees: and ive got the input wired up and am receiving results back, but when i select or hit enter a form POST ends up being triggered
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> so this: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[14:04:10] <robertmaxrees> this will show you how to get the value.
[14:06:52] <robertmaxrees> also, it sounds like you have this in a form - you'll want to bind an event listener on the form for the submit event and conditionally preventDefault() on it.
[14:08:37] <neruda> robertmaxrees: can you take a look at the url i provided and help me understand how the selections are being appended or "stored" in the DOM, i tried viewing page source but cant get that piece of code isolated
[14:08:48] <neruda> please
[14:08:52] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:08:57] <neruda> =)
[14:08:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a pretty simple process.
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> bind a change event listener.
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> get the value.
[14:09:13] <robertmaxrees> append a thing to a box.
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> done.
[14:09:46] <neruda> robertmaxrees: i see what you mean about the select option in the api
[14:40:31] <cjohnson> Does $.ajax success happen within the deferred chain? Meaning if I return within success will that value get passed to the next .then() ?
[14:40:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:40:39] <cjohnson> boo
[14:40:42] <robertmaxrees> .done() is the deferred one.
[14:40:52] <cjohnson> jquery doesn't support .then?
[14:41:00] <robertmaxrees> it also has .then()
[14:41:10] <cjohnson> perhaps I should describe my x
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> success isn't apart of the deferred setup.
[14:41:44] <robertmaxrees> .done(), .fail(), .then() etc are.
[14:42:22] <cjohnson> I have a bunch of ajax requests, and when they all complete, they have a success handler which either swaps some text, or complains that the text isn't swappable. So my thinking is if ( good ) {swap} else { return url; } and then I can use $.when to round them all up
[14:42:30] <cjohnson> and then only alert for the ones with returns
[14:42:51] <cjohnson> is that crazy? I can move from success into .then
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> just use .done() instead of .success()
[14:43:27] <cjohnson> and then I can still .then() after .done right?
[14:43:33] <cjohnson> .done is not the last item in the chain
[14:43:39] <robertmaxrees> $.when.apply( $, deferredCollection ).done(...
[14:43:46] <cjohnson> ah, I see
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to make an array of the ajax calls.
[14:43:53] <cjohnson> I was thinking of handling the check within each one but that makes more sense
[14:45:22] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: and then each arg to .done is the response from each request right?
[14:46:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:46:55] <cjohnson> .done(function(response1, response2) { ... })
[14:47:01] <cjohnson> or .done(function(responses) { ... } );
[14:47:13] <cjohnson> and are they still parsed as json accordingly?
[14:47:15] <robertmaxrees> the second one.
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> they get treated normally.
[14:47:22] <cjohnson> perfect
[14:54:23] <cjohnson> ok actually I did still want to handle the response within each request. let me sanity check with you robertmaxrees http://pastie.org/10283051
[14:54:44] <cjohnson> does that make sense? I want to do the swap as soon as each request completes, but if it's bad, then I want to round up all the bad URLs and alert them all at once after htey've all returned
[14:54:55] <cjohnson> does my use of two .dones make sense here?
[15:00:00] <robertmaxrees> deferreds.push($.get(url));
[15:00:13] <robertmaxrees> then use $.done.apply and $.then.apply
[15:00:21] <robertmaxrees> read the docs, search, etc.
[15:00:34] <cjohnson> well that's different from what I'm trying to do
[15:00:44] <cjohnson> I just want ot make sure it makes sense to pass the return from .done into $.when basically
[15:01:08] <robertmaxrees> that should work i guess?
[15:01:10] <robertmaxrees> it's been a whiole.
[15:01:15] <cjohnson> cool thanks
[19:18:26] <inthl> I have a class .foo that is being added within a jquery.dataTables row after e.g. one switches the pages of the table shown. now that .foo is not within the DOM then, so I can not issue $('.foo').on(mouseneter... or something. how could one select that .foo on a global scope or add it to the DOM after a next-page-event ? I do have a listener ready for that, which is being called on dataTable redraw
[21:08:12] <coderzm> hi all, i have php page which displays data and graph based on the datepicker dates. i am trying to use jquery's ajax to send the input field's dates to another php page where it will connect to mysql, and render a graph based on the data, and display the graph on the original page. i'm not sure if i've done it correctly, but the graph is not displaying on the original page.
[21:44:28] <vrlogrs1> hi everyone
[21:45:05] <vrlogrs1> i am seeing a very weird bug(?)
[21:45:12] <vrlogrs1> http://dev.funnode.com/games/align-4
[21:45:15] <vrlogrs1> if you open the console
[21:45:28] <vrlogrs1> (in chrome) click network
[21:45:40] <vrlogrs1> and you'll see imgs being loaded every 5-seconds or so
[21:46:00] <vrlogrs1> no idea where those are being loaded from (in the code)
[21:47:43] <vrlogrs1> if anyone has a minute to spare, please do advise what i am missing :(
[22:39:35] <ndimatteo> hey all, anyone around that could explain to me why $(window).on(â€˜statechangeâ€™) is firing twice for some reason?
[22:40:16] <ndimatteo> I have a link, where you can see this happening
[22:40:23] <ndimatteo> if anyone has a minute
[22:43:09] <ndimatteo> anyone around?
[22:43:58] <Boldty> Just post the link, maybe someone will see it and is able to help.
[22:45:31] <ndimatteo> https://github.com/ndimatteo/nickdimatteo.com/blob/master/public/assets/js/main.js#L103
[22:46:34] <ndimatteo> that console.log fires twice when the .on(â€˜clickâ€™) event fires from Line #181
[22:48:20] <ndimatteo> but doesnâ€™t fire twice when you hit the browser back/forward button, or when the .on(â€˜clickâ€™) event fires from line #149
[22:48:27] <ndimatteo> anyone have any ideas?
[22:53:58] <Boldty> Is onstatechange a standard js event? How is that supposed to get fired? When looking it up I only find stuff connected to the YouTube API
[22:57:14] <ndimatteo> Iâ€™m using History.js, not sure if itâ€™s a standard js event
[22:57:36] <Boldty> doesn't seem like one
[23:07:56] <hellyeah> using addClas, removeClass or toggleClass does the similar or same thing?
[23:36:24] <hellyeah> i got css function is not defined can yÄ±u tekk ne how can i fix it http://jsfiddle.net/o80o56yu/18/
[23:46:40] <Crucials> hellyeah try wrapping the $row[i] in $()
[23:46:47] <Crucials> so $($row[i]).css
[23:47:47] <hellyeah> Crucials:  we do that because of reaching the element? I am beginner.
[23:48:18] <Crucials> well basically $row[i] in that case is just a reference to a dom element, not a jquery one
[23:48:34] <hellyeah> ic
[23:48:41] <Crucials> and .css is a jquery method
[23:52:14] <hellyeah> Crucials:  this thing work only once not each time when i check or uncheck checkboxes can you tell me what ii miss http://jsfiddle.net/o80o56yu/24/
[23:53:19] <Crucials> hellyeah what do you want to happen? like what is the intended behaviour?
[23:53:26] <hellyeah> okey
[23:53:27] <Crucials> should it go from blue to orange?
[23:53:29] <hellyeah> hmm
[23:54:10] <hellyeah> when you check checkboxes it goes from orange to dark orange. When you uncheck goes from dark orange to blue. Are we good so far?
[23:54:21] <hellyeah> but this doesnt work in second time
[23:54:41] <Crucials> yes although thats already confusing
[23:54:52] <hellyeah> confusing?
[23:54:59] <Crucials> i mean thats what you want? orange -> dark orange -> blue?
[23:55:11] <hellyeah> actually just a sec
[23:55:55] <hellyeah> check it out now http://jsfiddle.net/o80o56yu/25/
[23:56:08] <hellyeah> when you uncheck the checkbox it returns to original color
[23:56:13] <hellyeah> i forgot to fix that
[23:56:34] <hellyeah> orange -> dark orange -> orange
[23:56:44] <hellyeah> this thing is executed only once
[23:56:52] <hellyeah> when i do same thing nothing happens
[23:57:42] <hellyeah> it should work
[23:57:47] <hellyeah> why it doesnt work
[23:59:04] <Crucials> you should probably have a better way to deferrentiate between them. which rows do you want switching from orange to dark orange?
[23:59:06] <hellyeah> question about that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21143662/jquery-change-event-is-only-fired-once
[23:59:22] <Crucials> all those rows should probably have the same class
[23:59:32] <hellyeah> Crucials:  if row is orange i want to change the color from orange to dark orange
