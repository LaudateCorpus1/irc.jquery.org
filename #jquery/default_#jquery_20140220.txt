[00:15:41] <Vivekananda> I am still stuck with the same issue of adding functionality to a generated list element
[00:15:56] <Vivekananda> I have tested fiddles and those work fine
[00:49:52] <glontu> hi
[00:50:15] <glontu> i would like to make a small jquery plugin
[00:50:55] <glontu> but i don't want it to be called on a selection of elements. i just want it to get called like $.pluginName()
[00:51:16] <glontu> all examples i find run on a selection of items and return that selection
[00:51:20] <systemfault> Then just add it on the jQuery object
[00:51:51] <systemfault> (function($) { $.lol = function() { alert('lol'); };  })(jQuery); //Super plugin
[00:51:56] <glontu> systemfault, like $.fn.extend() ?
[00:52:10] <systemfault> No, extending .fn extends the prototype.
[00:52:31] <glontu> ok. and what if inside the .pluginName i allso have internal functions that the plugin uses ?
[00:52:32] <systemfault> You want that if you want to call myNode.lol()
[00:52:47] <systemfault> glontu: just enclose them in the closure
[00:53:14] <systemfault> (function($) { function rofl() { alert('lol'); } $.lol = function() { rofl(); };  })(jQuery); //Super plugin
[00:53:29] <systemfault> rofl can only be called in the context of the closure
[00:53:35] <glontu> ok, thanks systemfault
[00:53:40] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[00:57:37] <Snoopal> i have a <button class="smh-select-remove">-</button> this element is added via javascript. now i tried jQuery('.smh-select-remove').on('click','button'),functino(e) { e.preventDefault(); } but the form is submitted :/
[00:57:39] <Snoopal> any ideas?
[00:58:27] <plepzz> Try using the parent element as the selector
[00:58:36] <systemfault> Never add a click handler to a submit button.. add a submit event to the form
[00:58:59] <plepzz> Oh
[00:59:45] <Snoopal> systemfault: why not?
[01:00:04] <systemfault> Snoopal: For example... pressing enter while in a field might not trigger it.
[01:00:14] <systemfault> Handling the submit event always work.
[01:00:15] <Snoopal> true story
[01:00:15] <plepzz> Uhm, if this is c/p from your code, you've mispelled function aswell.
[01:00:29] <Snoopal> thx for the hint :)
[01:00:37] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[01:00:39] <mordof> nice.. had the pleasure of learning how to work with/create deferred objects :) quite handy
[01:01:08] <systemfault> mordof: Yeah, it's super sexy... too bad the jQuery version is a bit crippled compared to other implementations
[01:01:36] <mordof> systemfault: https://github.com/madbook/jquery.wait   here's something that helps make it a bit nicer to implement for plugins and such if you ever need it
[01:02:16] <mordof> systemfault: i just tied in that .wait behavior into my plugin that needed to work with deferreds, to maintain normal chaining
[01:02:41] <mordof> it's not quite so intuitive if the user isn't aware of what's happening i think... but it's nice if it's properly explained
[01:02:55] <systemfault> Ah ok :) I wouldn't personally use it but I can understand why some people would.
[01:03:06] <mordof> systemfault: i haven't worked with any other implementations of deferreds before
[01:03:30] <systemfault> The jQuery implementation is fine for most usages though
[01:03:39] <mordof> systemfault: i ended up using it because my plugin is calling an api behind the scenes, creating an html set, and then the plugin does it's append
[01:03:51] <mordof> so i wanted to have normal chaining on the object after that
[01:03:57] <systemfault> I understand :)
[01:03:59] <mordof> and still be able to use .find() and the like to traverse the child
[01:04:06] <mordof> kinda hacky, heh
[01:04:33] <systemfault> No matter how hacky you think it is... I've seen worse :P
[01:04:40] <mordof> haha yeah probably xD
[01:04:55] <mordof> i'm happy with what i've put together, because the end output is *very* clean
[01:05:19] <mordof> and there's not a MASSIVE mess of callbacks and closures that the deferreds solved :D
[01:06:02] <systemfault> What's important with promises is that they're composable.... and they act like a async try/catch
[01:06:12] <Snoopal> systemfault: i added <form id="form-creator"> </form> and used jQuery('#form-creator').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); it still submits the form :(
[01:06:44] <mordof> systemfault: makes sense
[01:06:50] <systemfault> Snoopal: Does the form exists when you bind the event?
[01:06:58] <Snoopal> yep
[01:07:06] <Snoopal> but i think this is caused by the other form above it
[01:07:27] <systemfault> Hmm, is your HTML valid? (A form inside a form is not valid)
[01:07:42] <Snoopal> didn´t know that
[01:07:46] <Snoopal> so its invalid :D
[01:08:19] <systemfault> Snoopal: It's like having a <a> inside a <a>, it doesn't work because it wouldn't make sense because of event bubbling
[01:08:50] <Snoopal> makes sense. my "problem" is that i am building a form with a form :D
[01:10:03] <Snoopal> i think i will switch from button to <a> should make it easier
[01:10:32] <systemfault> You can still use a button if you want... but set it's "type" attribute to button
[01:10:42] <systemfault> The default type is submit
[01:11:00] <systemfault> <button type="button">Hello</button> when clicked won't submit the form
[01:11:16] <Snoopal> completley forgot that :D
[01:11:21] <Snoopal> thanks
[01:11:21] <Snoopal> :)
[01:13:14] <Snoopal> ok but now i run into the same "problem" as before. the event does not trigger. jQuery('.smh-select-remove').on('click',function() { console.log('lala'); });
[01:13:30] <Snoopal> nothing
[01:13:51] <systemfault> Hmm
[01:14:03] <systemfault> Where is that line declared?
[01:14:15] <Snoopal> jQuery(document).ready
[01:14:16] <systemfault>  Is it in a $(document).ready function^
[01:14:19] <systemfault> Hmm
[01:14:55] <systemfault> What is the version of jQuery you use?
[01:15:27] <systemfault> Do you have any errors in your console?
[01:15:38] <Snoopal> 1.10.2
[01:15:42] <Snoopal> no error
[01:16:09] <systemfault> I could write an example in jsfiddle.... but it's useless because I know it would work :(
[01:16:37] <systemfault> You add it with javascript?
[01:16:49] <systemfault> Is the handler called before you add it?
[01:17:01] <systemfault> If so, it won't work... but you could use event delegation to fix it
[01:17:38] <systemfault> Try $('body').on('click', '.smh-select-remove', function() { console.log('lala'); });
[01:18:16] <Snoopal> that works!
[01:18:39] <Snoopal> could you explain me the difference?
[01:18:41] <systemfault> It means that you were binding the event before the element existed
[01:18:45] <systemfault> Sure.
[01:19:05] <Snoopal> yes the element is added by a click on a button and should be able to be removed also
[01:19:31] <systemfault> When you do: $('.myclass').on('click',..... the event is bound directly on the element so if it doesn't exists, nothing is going to happen
[01:19:48] <Snoopal> i thought ".on" would get rid of this
[01:20:01] <systemfault> Only the second syntax.
[01:20:19] <Snoopal> i see
[01:20:23] <Snoopal> thanks! :)
[01:20:32] <systemfault> When you use: $('some parent element that is already there like... body').on('click', '.myClass', .... it uses event delegation
[01:20:54] <systemfault> The event is bound on the element $(here) and it works because of bubbling.
[01:21:20] <systemfault> You understand bubbling?
[01:22:07] <Snoopal> not really :D
[01:23:27] <systemfault> Let's say you have the following HTML <a href="http://www.google.com"><span class="a"><span class="b">Hello</span></span></a>
[01:23:55] <systemfault> Without bubbling, clicking on "Hello" would not trigger the <a>
[01:24:51] <Snoopal> ok
[01:25:55] <ursnation> look for value of class, if === b then move two spaces right for 4 spaces and voila
[01:25:59] <systemfault> So... when you click on "Hello", the click event happens on the element with class "b" but since it doesn't have a click handler.... it tries to element with class "a"... and since it doesn't have a click event bound to it... it delegates the click to its parent... the <a> and the click works since clicking on a anchor triggers the link
[01:26:11] <ursnation> or wast that not the question lol
[01:26:41] <Snoopal> i see
[01:26:54] <systemfault> Snoopal: The process of "trying" to trigger the event on all parents is "bubbling"
[01:27:06] <Snoopal> i see. thank you for the very good explanation! :)
[01:27:14] <systemfault> So... you can understand now why it's invalid to have a <a> within a <a>
[01:27:22] <delboy1978uk1> anyone know any good scripts for grabbing all links on a page? or a quick way of knocking one up?
[01:27:28] <systemfault> Because click on the innermost link would trigger both.
[01:27:42] <systemfault> Because of bubbling... so it wouldn't work properly.
[01:27:50] <Snoopal> roger that
[01:31:12] <Sagar> Hello, i am trying to post using jquery ajax. And i need to get the validators too. Here i want to check if someone enters a website and that function is true if(website  == good) { check email and then if both are good post that , here is my code : http://pastebin.com/Y5fwWvvL
[01:33:10] <xKraty> Sagar: why not use that awesome plugin that can handle ajax form http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[01:34:18] <delboy1978uk1> xKraty: is that the same one that used to be on that bassistance site?
[01:34:27] <xKraty> yeah
[01:35:09] <xKraty> i m always good with it
[01:35:22] <Sagar> xKraty : it's just i want to do, if website is entered successfully, it will then check email and if email is correct, it should post
[01:35:26] <delboy1978uk1> its awesome, and so customisable
[01:36:48] <xKraty> Sagar: also like you are doing you don't even check if are valid fields, just inserted
[01:36:57] <delboy1978uk1> i have little red triangle traffic sign s with the exclamation in now thanks to that wee thing, it looks awesome!
[01:37:23] <xKraty> delboy1978uk1: i'm used to put something like that aswell :D
[01:37:34] <xKraty> but yellow
[01:37:34] <Sagar> xKraty : i will do that later, for now what i want is if website field is done ok, it should then move to email and check it
[01:38:12] <xKraty> Sagar: just nest the if
[01:38:38] <xKraty> if website { if email { if whatever you want { post } }
[01:38:53] <xKraty> or
[01:38:59] <xKraty> set a sentinel
[01:39:02] <xKraty> at begin
[01:39:17] <xKraty> post = true; if ( !website ) post = false
[01:39:30] <xKraty> and then if ( post ) than make your ajax post
[01:39:50] <Sagar> xKraty : did you checked my code?
[01:40:03] <xKraty> Sagar: yeah
[01:41:28] <xKraty>    $("#output").html('Please enter your email.');
[01:41:28] <xKraty>             $.ajax({
[01:41:28] <xKraty>                 type: "POST",
[01:41:36] <xKraty> i'm not getting why you do that
[01:42:06] <xKraty> if you have no mail why post?!
[01:42:39] <Sagar> if means you didn't have a look on my code.
[01:42:44] <Sagar> http://pastebin.com/Y5fwWvvL : check this
[01:43:20] <Sagar> see if website is validated and posted, it should change the elements and then check email. and if email is success true, is should post post website and email stored in variables.
[01:46:42] <Sagar> xKraty??
[01:48:40] <xKraty> Sagar: back, sorry boss called me
[01:48:59] <xKraty> reindenting
[01:49:28] <Sagar> ok
[01:50:13] <duellsy> hey gang
[01:50:26] <xKraty> you want to change the website input class to email?
[01:50:41] <Sagar> yes only after a valid website is put in
[01:51:14] <Sagar> and then it should then check email and if email is also valid if should post both email and website
[01:52:11] <xKraty> you has a return false
[01:52:27] <xKraty> it will break everytime the function
[01:52:42] <|RicharD|> Hi, anyone use skrollr for parallax animation ?
[01:52:44] <xKraty> if email will never be executed
[01:52:46] <Sagar> i am using ajax so that page should not refresh on data post
[01:53:02] <Sagar> return false is to stop page refresh
[01:53:06] <Sagar> on php post clicl.
[01:53:09] <Sagar> click*
[01:53:25] <xKraty> yeah but you have it in the middle of the function
[01:53:32] <xKraty> you can just leave the one at the end
[01:53:52] <xKraty> or even use e.preventDefault();
[01:53:55] <Sagar> can u just create a new version of the code so that i can test it?
[01:54:00] <Sagar> please :_
[01:54:02] <Sagar> :)
[01:55:04] <xKraty> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0c5fad782d3b1d91b4f4
[01:56:08] <Sagar> xKraty : Nope it doesn't work :/
[01:56:53] <xKraty> Sagar: you should reproduce a demo on jsbin it's hard like that understand the porblem
[02:04:24] <duellsy> is there a way to make sure an image that is loaded by grabbing its url via ajax, is only told to fade in after it's loaded?
[02:06:33] <Technodrome> any jquery libraries for dealing with active trail class for a menu?
[02:08:07] <Sagar> xKraty : ok wait
[02:11:30] <systemfault> duellsy: Sure, just bind a load event to the img before setting its src
[02:13:21] <duellsy> systemfault thanks, I *just* tried that, and worked like a charm
[02:13:26] <systemfault> :D
[02:25:10] <Sagar> xKraty : around?
[02:28:04] <Sagar> xKraty : http://jsbin.com/magoyawo
[02:28:19] * Sagar slaps xKraty around a bit with a large trout
[02:32:07] * xKraty avoid the trout, steal it and cook it for dinner
[02:32:47] <xKraty> Sagar: now i got it, that's easy
[02:32:56] <xKraty> when you click first time it change the field to email
[02:33:20] <xKraty> email looks empty than it just return false
[02:33:56] <xKraty> but next time when you click the button  var website = $(".website_url").val(); will return null since the object doesnt exist
[02:34:06] <xKraty> you have to use 2 fields and hidden it
[02:34:08] <xKraty> hide*
[02:40:29] <Sagar> xKraty : Can u edit and tell me?
[02:40:49] <Sagar> i know that but what i wat to change the field class instead of making a new field
[02:42:53] <xKraty> Sagar: yeah but when you click the 2nd time .website_url doesn't exist so you can't get the value
[02:43:02] <xKraty> Sagar: you can make a workaround, hold on
[02:43:15] <Sagar> Ok sure i am waiting
[02:45:10] <xKraty> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9fde12bd3efbf4fea4e8
[02:45:22] <xKraty> something like that
[02:47:37] <tomshacham> hey all, I'm a bit stuck.. if i've got some elements e.g. $('div.element'), how do I create an array of their values e.g. $(this).data('value') to be used later - e.g. on mouseover, show the value
[02:48:38] <xKraty> tomshacham: you want all divs or all data elements of that div?
[02:49:06] <tomshacham> the data for all the divs
[02:49:31] <xKraty> you have to each all divs
[02:50:18] <xKraty> var data = [];
[02:50:18] <xKraty> $('div.element').each(function(){
[02:50:18] <xKraty>     data.push($(this).data());
[02:50:20] <xKraty> })
[02:50:41] <tomshacham> ahhhhh okay thanks a lot -:) I was using each wrongly before .. I believe
[02:51:16] <xKraty> there is 2 different each in jquery
[02:51:34] <xKraty> that one https://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:51:46] <xKraty> that each the selectors
[02:52:02] <xKraty> and generic jquery.each https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[02:52:45] <tomshacham> ahhhh that makes so much sense now.. thanks a lot xKraty
[02:52:48] <xKraty> it's like a normal foreach it iterates over objects and you handle with key => value instead of $(this)
[02:53:00] <xKraty> tomshacham: it struggled me aswell before!
[02:53:13] <tomshacham> hahaaa I see .. clever jQuery
[02:53:17] <Sagar> xKraty : Yes [16:15] <xKraty> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9fde12bd3efbf4fea4e8
[02:53:17] <Sagar> [
[02:53:24] <Sagar> but what you suggest would be good
[02:53:26] <Sagar> so tell me
[02:53:28] <pjppj> how hard is jquery
[02:53:59] <xKraty> Sagar: that one is fine if you don't want to use 2 fields
[02:55:52] <Sagar> xKraty : the one you gave https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9fde12bd3efbf4fea4e8 doesn't work
[02:58:49] <Sagar> xKarty : Can u make this one with 2 fields and if one is success, then go to email, with one field hidden
[03:02:59] <arvind_khadri> Hi, I am using jquery 1.10.2 and I am facing trouble making CORS POST requests.  My requests are being stopped. I have the required headers on the server.
[03:08:18] <Elirips> Hello. I'm using $("#myId").is(":visible") to test if a control is really "on screen", as is(":visible"); will also check the parents display status. But: If a parent is displayed, but has a size of 0 this does not work. Is there something like ":visible" that combines "visible and the size is not 0, 0"?
[03:10:56] <Error404NotFound> I am making an ajax with data with json object while one of the object properties may be empty. If this property is empty it is not included in post and server screams and error due to missing param.

[04:00:58] <Fernandos> lemonsparrow: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring
[04:01:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i would prob use Date(Date.parse("2/20/14"))
[04:01:36] <Cork> and then construct the new date string from the object
[04:02:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what after Date.parse(str)
[04:03:43] <Cork> js> a = Date(Date.parse("2/20/14")); print(a.getFullYear() + '-' + a.getMonth() + '-' + a.getDate())
[04:03:47] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:04:13] <Fernandos> here's the doc, just in case lemonsparrow needs it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#Examples
[04:05:58] <Fernandos> What's the proper way of making portrait-mode pictures fit into a landscape mode frame without distorting the aspect-ratio?
[04:07:17] <Cork> js> a = new Date(Date.parse("2/20/14")); print(a.getFullYear() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getMonth()).length) + a.getMonth() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getDate()).length) + a.getDate())
[04:07:19] <Fernandos> I think transform: scale(1.3) may work, but how would I determine which position to zoom in and what if the portrait-mode pictures have different aspect-ratios?
[04:07:23] <b-ot> Cork: 1914-01-20
[04:07:27] <Cork> uh...
[04:07:30] <Cork> WTF
[04:07:42] <Cork> 1914?!?
[04:08:10] <Cork> ah, right
[04:08:44] <Cork> js> a = new Date(Date.parse("2/20/14")); a.setYear(a.getYear() + 100); print(a.getFullYear() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getMonth()).length) + a.getMonth() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getDate()).length) + a.getDate())
[04:08:53] <b-ot> Cork: 114-01-20
[04:08:58] <Cork> sigh
[04:09:00] <Uhkis> :D
[04:09:09] <Fernandos> hehe, Cork that was nice
[04:09:58] <Cork> js> a = new Date("2/20/14"); a.setYear(a.getFullYear() + 100); print(a.getFullYear() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getMonth()).length) + a.getMonth() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getDate()).length) + a.getDate())
[04:10:14] <b-ot> Cork: 2014-01-20
[04:10:16] <Cork> THERE...
[04:10:24] <Cork> man i hate the date api in js...
[04:10:27] <Uhkis> :)
[04:11:36] <Cork> Fernandos: are you using background image or an img tag?
[04:11:42] <Fernandos> img
[04:11:51] <Fernandos> well, I use this http://showcase.awkwardgroup.com/
[04:12:10] <Cork> well width: 100% and height: auto should work i think
[04:12:34] <Cork> the browser scales by default for img tags
[04:13:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cool thanks buddy
[04:13:03] <decx> width: 100% is dirty
[04:13:07] <Fernandos> hmm lemme give you an example image, so you know why that didn't work
[04:13:15] <decx> i prefer just max-width: 100%
[04:13:24] <Cork> hmm
[04:13:28] <Cork> you have a point
[04:13:40] <decx> i set it on all images anyway
[04:13:48] <Cork> max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; should solve it if the parent is the full screen size
[04:13:49] <decx> for them responsiveness
[04:13:50] <decx> ^^
[04:14:22] <Cork> if you want the image to never be cut of that is
[04:15:19] <Cork> decx: and if you want max-width or just width depends on the effect your looking for. but in this case, ya
[04:15:38] <decx> yeah, sure there are always exceptions
[04:16:17] <decx> but as a rule of thumb it cant hurt to put max-width 100 on img, canvas, iframe ...
[04:16:25] <Fernandos> Cork: what about making this fit into 600x300 http://i.imgur.com/5vwNzMe.jpg
[04:19:31] <Cork> Fernandos: http://jsfiddle.net/j7B53/
[04:20:13] <Sagar> xKarty : Thanks a ton :D
[04:21:21] <Cork> man i just got a flashback of the times when you couldn't use max- css...
[04:21:32] * Cork hates ie6 for a few minutes...
[04:22:56] <Fernandos> Cork: yeah that's what I also got, that looks awful, when there is so much space on the left and right
[04:23:15] <Cork> Fernandos: ok, so that isn't what you want?
[04:23:23] <Cork> what do you want to happen with the image?
[04:23:25] <Cork> cut off?
[04:23:59] <Cork> "adjust" isn't exactly describing how you want it to adjust to the limited space
[04:24:09] <Fernandos> Cork: Yep, cut it off so that it fits, without looking distorted
[04:25:01] <Fernandos> The problem is that you don't know from where to start the image, except you do it manually for each image.
[04:25:07] <Fernandos> I mean the top region
[04:25:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/j7B53/1/?
[04:25:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/j7B53/1/ ?
[04:26:58] <decx> what kind of resolution is 600x300 anyway
[04:27:43] <Cork> i think i have it on my mobile :)
[04:28:23] <lite> So. Ive been looking for out memory leak for weeks now where changing tabs in our web app would cause memory to be allocated in the heap which seemingly never gets GCed. I have finally located a very weird event called global_search that looks like this : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea1aab925be77940ee80 .  If I comment this out changing tabs only allocates a few 100kb per tab change. If I leave it in I allocate +10mb per tab change. What is t
[04:28:23] <lite> he problem with this event?
[04:28:23] <decx> 2x1 seems just wrong
[04:28:25] <decx> :>
[04:28:55] <Fernandos> decx: it's a slider and looks like this here atm. http://i.imgur.com/r7ru9L8.png
[04:29:12] <Cork> *slideshow
[04:29:21] <Fernandos> yep
[04:29:22] <Cork> not a slider
[04:30:18] <decx> so no place for a vertical scroll eh
[04:30:35] <Fernandos> I don't know, it just looks too focused I think. Maybe scale(.7) + width:100%?
[04:30:36] <Cork> sure you can have a vertical scroll if you like
[04:30:47] <decx> well you have to deal with the cutoff for portrait style pics in landscape then
[04:31:16] <Fernandos> I mean most of the image is hidden, because of it's aspect-ratio
[04:31:21] <decx> Cork combining a slideshow and vertical scroll seems like a big ux task
[04:31:24] <Cork> but ya, you can't really scale it so it fits in landscape and still show it all
[04:31:30] <Cork> decx: ya
[04:31:37] <Cork> but there is place for it :)
[04:31:49] <Cork> it would be weird to have though
[04:32:07] <lite> actually I should probably give you the entire file : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/237432786525237dc587
[04:32:14] <decx> could be done well enough on touch interfaces
[04:32:28] <decx> swipe up down, scroll, swipe left right next/prev slide
[04:32:52] <Fernandos> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/j7B53/2/ added scale(.8), but it now has even more "blue"space there
[04:33:23] <Cork> Fernandos: scale doesn't take the context of the page into consideration
[04:33:41] <Cork> so you can't really use it if you want the effect your talking of
[04:34:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: there's an issue with your line for month
[04:34:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: newDate.getFullYear() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+newDate.getMonth()).length) + newDate.getMonth() + '-' + '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+newDate.getDate()).length) + newDate.getDate()
[04:34:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: it gives 00 for jan instead of 01
[04:34:38] <Cork> ah
[04:34:39] <Cork> right
[04:34:47] <Cork> getMonth() +1
[04:34:57] <Cork> it goes from 0 - 11 not 1 - 12
[04:36:03] <Fernandos> hmm.. true. scaling down using transforms, then scaling up with width:100% wouldn't work the way I intended..
[04:36:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+newDate.getMonth()).length + 1) ??
[04:37:00] <Cork> '00'.substr(0, 2-(''+a.getMonth()).length) + (a.getMonth() + 1)
[04:38:34] <Cork> lite: that plugin is buggy
[04:39:00] <Cork> lite: they don't know about the stack variable in jquery
[04:39:11] <Cork> so they leak every element that it ever touches
[04:39:14] <lite> Cork: tell me about it. I am 99% sure its the reason our app is messed up
[04:39:28] <Cork> lite: no i know it is
[04:39:34] <Cork> is see the error in the code :
[04:39:37] <Cork> *:)
[04:39:42] <lite> Cork: but how do I fix it. This is 4 year old code
[04:40:01] <lite> I was given the task : "fix the memory leak in x and y tables"
[04:40:32] <Fernandos> with old code you either rewrite it, or bite it
[04:40:42] <Cork> lite: line 9 should have an element.prevObject = null;
[04:40:48] <arvind_khadri> Hi, I am using jquery 1.10.2 and I am facing trouble making CORS POST requests.  My requests are being stopped. I have the required headers on the server.
[04:40:59] <Cork> lite: else you will build a constant stack of elements
[04:41:08] <lite> Cork:  in toggle ?
[04:41:08] <Cork> lite: also you should do the same on line 4
[04:41:12] <Cork> before
[04:41:16] <Cork> an extra line
[04:41:37] <lite> Cork: in this right ?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/237432786525237dc587 I linked two gists
[04:41:44] <Cork> lite: jq_selector_set = jq_selector_set.not(something)
[04:41:55] <Cork> lite: jq_selector_set.prevObject === the value before you did not
[04:41:57] <Mark_Morcom> Hi, need some help please - I am using Slimmenu and have already implimented it. In the <UL> in my souce code - I do not declare any styling information. However, when computed - The UL has the following style display: none; height: 92px; padding-top: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;
[04:42:04] <Mark_Morcom> This is computed by Jquery
[04:42:15] <Cork> lite: jq_selector_set.prevObject.prevObject the value from the value before the old add and so on
[04:42:22] <Mark_Morcom> I have no clue how - full site search cannot find any reference to 92px
[04:42:25] <Cork> you get an infinite stack range in the code
[04:42:31] <lite> Cork: slow down :) Im trying to understand it all
[04:42:44] <Cork> lite: let me make an example
[04:44:07] <Fernandos> Mark_Morcom: why is having no margins etc. a problem?
[04:44:09] <lite> Cork: line #4 is right after elems = $([]) right? just making sure were looking at the same here
[04:44:34] <Fernandos> Mark_Morcom: you can just readd it, wherever you need it, either by css or javascript
[04:44:47] <Mark_Morcom> Fernandos, the 92px high is a problem
[04:45:20] <Mark_Morcom> Im implimenting a PSD file from a client. very little space to change things
[04:45:39] <Mark_Morcom> I need to increase it to 96
[04:45:48] <usc911> Hey guys, is there a way to check values of 2 inputs after the second has been completed? e.g. fill input on, fill input two then check or vica versa?
[04:45:48] <Fernandos> Mark_Morcom: probably here https://github.com/adnantopal/slimmenu/blob/master/jquery.slimmenu.js#L99
[04:46:02] <Cork> lite: http://jsfiddle.net/Vay6C/
[04:46:02] <Fernandos> sorry, gotta go. meeting :/
[04:46:27] <Cork> lite: in your last link it is line 24 and line 29
[04:47:27] <lite> Cork:  so after I add 'this' i remove the previous element?
[04:47:44] <Cork> no you cut the link to the old match set
[04:47:48] <Cork> so you don't keep that alive
[04:47:59] <Cork> check the jsfiddle i made for you
[04:48:06] <Cork> you should grasp what happens from there
[04:52:22] <lite> Cork: Okay. IVe gone through your fiddle. The way I understand it is that whenever you modify your collection there is still a reference to the previous collection through prevObject?
[04:52:42] <Cork> yes
[04:53:01] <Cork> it is to make the .end() .unwrap functions possible
[04:53:14] <lite> so whenever I do a elems.add or elems.not I need to make sure to call elems.prevObject = null afterwards, correct?
[04:53:38] <Cork> lite: .not() .filer() .filter(), .add() ...
[04:54:01] <Cork> every time you base your new object from an old object you need to be wary of the prevObject variable
[04:54:05] <lite> right. I only mention .not and .add because those are the two methods used here
[04:54:12] <lite> Cork:  Okay. thanks
[04:54:12] <Cork> ya
[04:54:48] <lite> If this solves my problem Cork, I may owe you a beer.
[04:55:56] <lite> that is if you want one
[04:56:10] <Cork> heh
[04:58:08] <d0de> How can I insert an element once before the first element of a certain class?
[04:58:21] <d0de> I know how to insert it before every element in a class using insertBefore();
[04:58:35] <d0de> but I can't work out how to insert only before the 1st element in the class
[04:58:56] <Cork> $('.class_type').first().before(new_element)
[05:00:44] <d0de> Cork, will test, thank you
[05:02:17] <d0de> Cork, works great, thanks
[05:04:27] <d0de> is there any easy way to invoke a transition or animation for insertBefore or insertAfter ?
[05:04:56] <Cork> you need to have a pre state (ex a class)
[05:05:08] <Cork> and then trigger a page reflow (.height() on the element)
[05:05:12] <Cork> and then remove the class
[05:06:12] <Cork> so ex var elm = $('<div').addClass('hidden');  $(target).append(elm); elm.height() elm.removeClass('hidden')
[05:06:53] <wturrell> hi. is there a way to combine a check that an element exists with assigning it to a variable - I'm wondering if the following is inefficient use of the dom…     if ($('foo').find('bar').length) { var baz = $('foo').find('baz'); }
[05:07:30] <Cork> wturrell: why do you need to?
[05:07:39] <Cork> normally jquery handles that internally
[05:07:45] <d0de> Cork, thank you, will investigate
[05:08:52] <wturrell> Cork: just that I want to cache the variable so I can use it in multiple functions in an app, but wasn't sure if initially checking for the element but not storing it at the same time was inefficient…
[05:09:24] <Cork> wturrell: again, why do you need to check if the element exists?
[05:10:03] <Cork> $('.this.doesn.not.exist').find('.other').not('.something').autocomplete()
[05:10:05] <Cork> won't crash
[05:10:16] <Cork> so why do you need to check if it exists
[05:14:31] <wturrell> Cork: ah ok - so I can just assign it then check the length of the object?    The check is simply so I don't bother calling some other functions that process it if it's not there…
[05:16:58] <Cork> wturrell: no my point is you can assign it
[05:17:01] <Cork> and then just use it
[05:17:15] <Cork> if nothing was found, the code simply won't be used
[05:17:56] <Cork> wturrell: there is a few examples where you need to actually make sure the element existed
[05:18:02] <Cork> but those are quite rare
[05:18:15] <Cork> .offset() and position() is the two main ones
[05:19:09] <wturrell> Cork: ok thanks, I won't worry then.
[05:19:28] <Cork> wturrell: to make it a little less magic
[05:19:46] <Cork> all functions inside jquery uses .each(function() {}) to work with the match set
[05:19:55] <Cork> and all selectors always return a jquery object
[05:20:04] <Cork> so if nothing was found you get an empty array
[05:20:12] <Cork> so it just loops a zero length array
[05:25:49] <wturrell> yep, that sounds vaguely familiar to a blog or a video or something I saw about the jQuery source…
[05:36:32] <Tomashe> $(".page:not(hidden)"); looks like , this isnt working on live dom
[05:36:38] <Tomashe> there is any alternative?
[05:40:41] <Cork> not(hidden) ?!?
[05:40:51] <Uhkis> Tomashe: :visible :)
[05:40:51] <Cork> do you mean .page:not(:hidden) ?
[05:41:01] <Cork> ?api :hidden
[05:41:01] <b-ot> Cork: :hidden Selector: Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[05:41:30] <Cork> Tomashe: and selectors are never live
[05:41:42] <Cork> Tomashe: they are always a snapshot in time
[05:48:32] <Snoopal> if i have in source <input type="radio" name="foo" value="foo1"> bar <input type="radio" name="foo" value="foo2"> bar2 <- how do i get bar and bar2 ?
[05:48:58] <decx> not in any sane way
[05:49:09] <Snoopal> yeah thought so :/
[05:49:11] <xKraty> Snoopal: you can onlt get once at time, those are radio
[05:49:18] <xKraty> only*
[05:49:43] <xKraty> $('input[name="foo"]').val();
[05:49:54] <Snoopal> im not wondering about the value
[05:49:59] <Snoopal> im wondering about bar and bar2
[05:50:04] <xKraty> the text?
[05:50:08] <Snoopal> yes
[05:50:13] <xKraty> wrap it in a span
[05:50:41] <Snoopal> and then?
[05:50:42] <xKraty> $('input[name="foo"]').each(function() { $(this).next('span').text() }); could work i swear
[05:50:49] <Snoopal> ahhh
[05:50:50] <Snoopal> cool
[05:50:51] <Snoopal> thanks :)
[05:50:54] <decx> and label that shit, usability !
[05:51:09] <Snoopal> so i will use label instead :)
[05:51:12] <Snoopal> but thx for the hint
[05:51:19] <decx> <label><input><span></span></label>
[05:51:37] <xKraty> decx: it was obvious he d have wrap it right Snoopal? :D
[05:52:34] <jrgriffiniii> Hello everyone
[05:52:42] <decx> well i wouldnt want to write <input id="stuff"><label for="stuff"></label> for every input label
[05:52:51] <jrgriffiniii> I have a quick question regarding a JavaScript/D3 related question
[05:53:15] <jrgriffiniii> Is the following visualization ("Seeing Space in Terms of Track Length and Cost of Shipping ") D3 or Adobe Flash: http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=121&project_id=#swf
[05:53:35] <jrgriffiniii> I believed it to be Flash; but was corrected by two colleagues and told it was D3
[05:54:09] <jrgriffiniii> I was under the impression that D3 was JavaScript based, and could not be integrated with ActionScript/Flash
[05:55:32] <decx> it's flash
[05:55:58] <jrgriffiniii> Thank you, I was questioning my sanity
[06:12:10] <d0de> Let's say I dynamically load an HTML5 audio file by changing the source with javascript. Is there a way I can check the buffer status of the new file?
[06:12:18] <SprkDev> Anybody worked with boostrap modal before? Why isn't my modal popping up in another window but appearing within the page?
[06:12:39] <seutje> SprkDev: because then it wouldn't be a modal anymore
[06:12:48] <SprkDev> Maybe I explain my problem wrong. The modal windows should still look apart from the window you are in though, right?
[06:12:52] <paq> SprkDev, you mean another browser window?

[06:14:24] <SprkDev> yes :-)
[06:14:28] <seutje> did you make sure to include any stylesheets the library ships with?
[06:14:29] <d0de_> seutje, looks like those are only supported in FF thought?

[06:36:47] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[06:36:54] <airdem> hi
[06:38:59] <Vivekananda> jquery question and I am stuck on it. Had to reinstall os but am back now. So the question. if I create an element dynamically and on the fly and assign it to a class then how do I give it a jquery hover function ? and where ? . Assuming the hover funciton is assigned to the class of elements ?
[06:39:57] <decx> $('parentthatexistsonload').on('hover','.class',fn)
[06:40:03] <seutje> Vivekananda: delegate the event to a parent element that doesn't change
[06:40:18] <seutje> don't think u can use the "hover" shorthand though

[06:40:23] <seutje> `api on
[06:40:23] <b-ot> seutje: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:40:36] <decx> mouseenter mouseout then
[06:40:42] <seutje> Deprecated in jQuery 1.8, removed in 1.9
[06:40:46] <seutje> yeah
[06:40:49] <Vivekananda> seutje: but if I want to event to happen to the new element
[06:40:59] <seutje> not mouseout, mouseleave
[06:41:06] <decx> oh right
[06:41:23] <seutje> Vivekananda: well, u bind it to a higher element, and tell it to only act if the event came from something that has that class
[06:41:26] <decx> or just mouseover but that would be more expensive
[06:41:52] <seutje> like $('body').on('mouseenter mouseleave', '.someClass', function() { ... })
[06:42:03] <Vivekananda> so something like $('body').on('hover', '.myclass', function() {} ?
[06:42:14] <seutje> now u can add as many .someClass elements to the body, their hover events will be caught by that handler
[06:42:33] <seutje> cause it's essentially a single handler on the body that just check where the event originated from
[06:43:00] <Vivekananda> seutje: yes but I wrote on 'hover' and you wrote mouseneter and leave
[06:43:08] <decx> hover is a shorthand
[06:43:10] <seutje> hover is a shorthand for those 2
[06:43:29] <Vivekananda> did you mean that on hover wont work the
[06:43:30] <Vivekananda> ok
[06:43:30] <seutje> it's been removed in 1.9
[06:43:39] <Vivekananda> also when I write this code where do I put it ? inside the ready document ?
[06:43:49] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5gFN/ i'm trying to get this google adsense ad to run inside message here, but it doesnt show
[06:43:52] <Vivekananda> seutje: what has been removed ? hover ? or mousenter and leae ?
[06:43:53] <anew> it just shows the coce
[06:43:54] <anew> code
[06:44:01] <anew> how can i show the actual adsense ad ?
[06:44:01] <decx> if you bind multiple events you can get the type with function(e){ e.type }
[06:44:30] <decx> so you can do if e.type = mouseenter -> blah
[06:44:45] <anew> can anyone help there
[06:46:47] <seutje> Vivekananda: the hover shortcut to enter/leave
[06:47:28] <plepzz_> anew: Check the console when you run the Fiddle
[06:47:30] <Sagar> xKarty
[06:47:38] <Sagar> xKraty
[06:47:50] <anew> bad request?
[06:48:04] <msafi> Say I selected $(".some-element"), how can I know what HTML tag this element is?
[06:49:59] <plepzz_> anew: Yep
[06:50:19] <anew> yeah but that's because the string is not correct
[06:50:23] <anew> inside message: ''
[06:51:12] <seutje> msafi: u wanna check it against something, or just grab the element type?
[06:51:31] <decx> $(".some-element")[0].nodeName
[06:51:41] <seutje> yeah
[06:51:55] <msafi> seutje: I wanted to check it against something. Found .prop('tagName') on Stack Overflow
[06:51:59] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5gFN/1/
[06:52:01] <seutje> if u wanna check , could use .is('someElement')
[06:52:02] <anew> i tried this it doesnt work either
[06:52:16] <msafi> seutje: I want to check if it's a certain HTML tag.
[06:52:27] <msafi> I don't wanna check if it's another element.
[06:53:14] <anew> can anyone help there
[06:53:17] <anew> why the adsense ad is not appearing
[06:53:19] <decx> yeah .is() would be the best for that
[06:53:19] <seutje> msafi: frankly, either way is good, $('.foo')[0].nodeName is probably fastest, but really won't matter much
[06:53:34] <seutje> .is() might be a bit overkill
[06:54:07] <decx> right why not juts target $('thiselement.some-element')
[06:54:12] <plepzz_> anew: Also I get an error saying the request is not allow because the domain is not int the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[06:54:33] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5gFN/1/ plepzz_ have you tried this new version
[06:54:50] <plepzz_> Yep, still the same errors
[06:55:08] <anew> hmmm where do u see that error in console i dont see it
[06:55:56] <plepzz_> I get 5 of 'em
[06:56:04] <anew> whoa
[06:56:35] <anew> ... i dont get any
[06:56:37] <plepzz_> I think you should test on another server, instead of jsfiddle
[06:56:44] <anew> yes ihave it on my server also
[06:56:45] <anew> no errors
[06:56:49] <anew> it's just the adsense ad doesnt appear
[06:57:18] <plepzz_> Sorry, I'm out of suggestions then :)
[06:58:03] <anew> damn
[06:58:50] <|RicharD|> someone use skrollr ?
[06:59:53] <|RicharD|> I'm using it and I have a little problem, http://jsfiddle.net/4QEFE/ I have the string, First and Second, I don't know why it show both when the second have opacity: 0 and should be visible only when the First is hidden
[07:03:30] <d0de_> media events for html5 audio/video such as canplaythrough - do they only fire once, or can you query the element and get a response?
[07:03:57] <d0de_> as in, can I call it rather than setting an event listening?
[07:13:41] <msafi> Anyone know why elm.wrap($('<a></a>')); elm.prop('tagName') is not 'A'?
[07:15:01] <Vivekananda> so fiddle no 1 works here but 2 does not . http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/Jt6bF/2/  can someone tell me what i doing wrong
[07:15:28] <BillCriswell> msafi: Is it returning what elm is?
[07:15:53] <msafi> BillCriswell: it is returning what elm is before the .wrap
[07:16:23] <BillCriswell> I don't think calling wrap on an element would change what the element is
[07:17:11] <msafi> BillCriswell: that sux. been trying to debug this for a good 30 minutes with low sugar…well, how can I know that it's been wrapped properly? I'm writing tests...
[07:18:31] <BillCriswell> msafi: How about elm.parent().prop('tagName') === 'A'
[07:19:00] <msafi> IT WORKS!!!!!
[07:19:08] <msafi> hehe
[07:19:22] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeet
[07:19:37] <Vivekananda> anyone care to check my fiddles and advice ?
[07:20:14] <hpekdemi1> how do I put my custom script tags into separate file to include it in my html?
[07:20:28] <msafi> BillCriswell: thanks! :)
[07:20:34] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:20:48] <hpekdemi1> when I put my "script id="hello" type="handlebars">" into a js file it is an error on include.
[07:21:21] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I'd just use CSS for what you're trying to do. We needed CSS to do this kind of thing years ago safely cross browser but it's not needed anymore.
[07:21:51] <hpekdemi1> ok it works now.
[07:21:55] <hpekdemi1> ignore it.
[07:22:42] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: ? I did not get your last sentence. also if jquery is a choice then first thing is it should work!! isnt it ?
[07:23:08] <Vivekananda> as long as the code is valid logically and syntactically in jquery
[07:25:29] <nmkr> ello guys.. i want to traverse an div tree and add positions numbers, what i got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/XzbM3/1/ .. can some tell me how to traverse all main > sub > sub-sub  (> sub-sub-sub etc..) elements?
[07:25:50] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: ... what?
[07:26:30] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: if my current code is correct why does it not work. ? I will try to see CSS if I can get this to work
[07:26:42] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/Jt6bF/3/
[07:27:28] <BillCriswell> nmkr: Why are you adding the position numbers?
[07:28:16] <BillCriswell> Just for aesthetics?
[07:28:32] <nmkr> i need this numbers in the format for output, and as id for add content
[07:28:34] <BillCriswell> Also, why aren't you using nested list here? Seems like exactly what you need.
[07:29:05] <iDevelop> Hey
[07:29:06] <nmkr> i tryd with ol > li elements, but unfortonly i cannot solve this inside a table.. with divs i can solve it in tables ..
[07:29:14] <iDevelop> There's an error w/ the latest jquery
[07:29:21] <iDevelop> Who do I speak to?
[07:30:05] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: You can mention it here so people can try to confirm it, or if you don't want to I think the address is bugs.jquery.com?
[07:30:23] <iDevelop> is there a developer irl
[07:30:23] <iDevelop> irc
[07:30:28] <iDevelop> I tried jquery-developers
[07:30:35] <iDevelop> but that didn't work
[07:30:51] <iDevelop> and it says this in chrome:
[07:30:52] <iDevelop> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[07:30:56] <BillCriswell> There's a few in here, not always active.. but if something catches there attention enough I'm sure they'll speak.
[07:30:59] <iDevelop> but the file
[07:31:05] <iDevelop> jquery.js:5374
[07:31:27] <BillCriswell> Yeah it's been doing that for a while, it's just a warning.
[07:31:48] <iDevelop> But why?
[07:31:51] <nmkr> BillCriswell: i solved this already with ol > li .. http://jsfiddle.net/V6Kj7/11/         .. but i need it with divs ..
[07:33:00] <BillCriswell> because jQuery has been updates to address it apparently. I think I read it's been fixed in 1.11?
[07:33:48] <BillCriswell> hasn't been*
[07:33:51] <iDevelop> nmkr: not sure if you really care, but that works in the older jQuery too! http://jsfiddle.net/V6Kj7/12/
[07:34:41] <nmkr> dunno just picked one for the demo :P
[07:36:45] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: It is fixed in 1.11 http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14282
[07:37:04] <BillCriswell> nmkr: Why a div over a ul li combination?
[07:38:07] <nmkr> because i cannot put an <tr> under an <li> element..
[07:38:44] <nmkr> my stackoverflow question to solve it via my first solution the ol>li one : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21907717/ol-outside-of-table-element?answertab=active#tab-top
[07:39:06] <BillCriswell> I don't think tr can be a direct child of anything besides a thead, tbody, tfooter or a table.
[07:39:11] <nmkr> so that doestn works, know i want to archieve it via divs, i need it it counted and accessable per id
[07:39:41] <nmkr> yes unfortunately
[07:41:01] <BillCriswell> nmkr: Why are you using a table here?
[07:41:40] <iDevelop> back
[07:42:13] <nmkr> im restricted to the old base to use a table.. there would be nice if its an lists based code i know.. but i cannot change that :/
[07:42:26] <|RicharD|> any tips http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21912196/hide-and-show-text-with-skrollr ? I have a problem with skrollr
[07:42:47] <nmkr> so i need a method or logic to traverse (deep)nested divs..
[07:46:10] <iDevelop> Hey guys, I've been reading tutorials about parsing json with jquery
[07:46:16] <iDevelop> I can never get it to work
[07:46:26] <iDevelop> im quite beginner, but decent
[07:46:52] <bristleback> hi
[07:47:20] <bristleback> how can I make a function that automatically called on the page finishes loading?
[07:47:33] <bristleback> and also va have a name for it
[07:50:00] <iDevelop> bristleback: use this... http://jsfiddle.net/KEzeJ/
[07:51:21] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: There's $.parseJSON('stringofjson') but that's about all jQuery really has to do with JSON in regards to managing it.
[07:51:58] <iDevelop> Alright
[07:52:39] <iDevelop> do you have time to do me an example and I try modifying it? I'll give you the json and you try to work with it using ul, li or something?
[07:53:36] <BillCriswell> If you could mock up a demo of what you're trying to do I can hopefully take a look at it and help you with whatever you're trying to do.
[07:53:44] <BillCriswell> jsbin.com is the one I use.
[07:56:47] <Vivekananda> any clues anyone ?
[07:56:55] <ezekielnoob> hi
[07:57:32] <Vivekananda> I am actually asking a jquery question in the jquery channel and not getting responses but alternatives today. Indeed a sad day for jquery !
[07:57:52] <ezekielnoob> sad day for you only probably
[07:58:56] <bristleback> iDeleop:  thanks! that's not I'm looking for
[07:59:13] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I'm not going to try to get something you could get done in a lot easier way the hard way. It's a waste of both our time.
[07:59:18] <bristleback> I also want that function to have a name and to be able to call it whenever I want
[07:59:31] <seutje> nmkr: pretty messy, but seems to work fine
[07:59:40] <bristleback> but I don't want to call it manually inside $(document).ready()
[07:59:44] <seutje> could probably generalize it to a single recursor that doesn't care about .main and .sub
[08:00:36] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: hmmm and yet it is only a small fiddle and just one fucntion I am interested in. This is just one step in a series of steps I hae to take and add more animation elements to it. also as I showed in version 1 of fiddle it already works but does not work with the on () syntax
[08:00:52] <Vivekananda> if this is not good enough reason to give me a pointer then I dont know what is
[08:01:29] <seutje> nmkr: even holds up when using multiple mains on the same level: http://jsfiddle.net/XzbM3/3/
[08:01:49] <alainus> can I change the value of 'this' in a callback function? I'm currently setting $that = this; before executing it, but is there another way ?
[08:06:25] <xKraty> alainus: i do like that aswell, because every callback has his own this, it may exist a parent.this but no idea :D
[08:06:32] <nmkr> seutje: wow, thanks know i have the direction to solve this :)
[08:06:56] <iDevelop> hey
[08:07:04] <iDevelop> who said they would help me?
[08:07:11] <iDevelop> I was typing up some code
[08:07:12] <iDevelop> and had to lookup jquery
[08:07:30] <iDevelop> (i really do suck at it)
[08:07:40] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: http://jsfiddle.net/Jt6bF/4/ here is your code doing what you're asking it to do. You can't do like $('foo').on('mousenter mouseleave', ...) then pass it two functions.
[08:07:40] <iDevelop> BillCriswell:
[08:07:47] <xKraty> don't say like that youDevelop :D
[08:07:49] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: Was it you?
[08:07:59] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: Are you the guy who said to use jsbin?
[08:08:02] <xKraty> BillCriswell: was it you?
[08:08:08] <ezekielnoob> hi guys... in the $.ajax() function the 'data' doesn't seem to accept an associative array
[08:08:11] <BillCriswell> HAha yes.
[08:08:13] <alainus> xkr47, closure seems tobe a way: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6286109/890899
[08:08:26] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/yarovehu/1/watch?html,js,console,output
[08:08:27] <ezekielnoob> is there a work around for this?
[08:08:30] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: is that the right one?
[08:08:40] <BillCriswell> I just used css counter stuff... I never thought I'd ever use that.
[08:08:48] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: Yes.
[08:09:05] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: I can register on there with github? I'm doing it!
[08:09:10] <xKraty> alainus: i prefer to put it in a var tbh
[08:10:20] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: Did you see what I added to that?
[08:11:36] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: does not seem to work after the initial enter . I am trying to replicate this http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/Jt6bF/1/  . you can hover over the word 'Supermicro' and do repeat hovers and see how it works but your fiddle does not do that
[08:11:45] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: no?
[08:11:57] <iDevelop> BillCriswell:  add a paragraph to the html and ill tell you
[08:12:07] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:13:22] <iDevelop> I thought it was a live editor
[08:13:53] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: I guess it didn't work or I broke it.
[08:14:11] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: I'm going to go into "whisper mode" with you. It's annoying with joiners and leavers
[08:14:58] <BillCriswell> I actually have some work I have to wrap up.
[08:15:08] <basiclaser> gentlemen, why does iframe / z-index appear to be behaving different amongst browsers? www.basic-laser.com/100b
[08:16:57] <iDevelop> basiclaser: why are you using iframes?
[08:17:01] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/2/edit
[08:18:49] <basiclaser> iDevelop: for a video-background featureI would like the iframe to appear behind all other elements, i have set it at z-index:-1; but it seems to jump over content in opera and FF
[08:18:53] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: I don't know what your json looks like, but if it has title and body properties you can do data.title and data.body
[08:19:26] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: go to the url in the code
[08:19:36] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: i am clueless how I would do it for multiple
[08:22:31] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: That's an object, it seems like it shoudl be an array though. You'd have to use a for loop to output the data.
[08:24:21] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: So like... $.each( data, function( index, notification ){ console.log( notification.notification_title, notification. notification_body ) });
[08:24:46] <iDevelop> what's the index, notification?
[08:24:49] <BillCriswell> I used jQuery's each for convenience.
[08:24:50] <iDevelop> what's the functions params
[08:25:07] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: It's index then the elemeent in the collection
[08:25:14] <iDevelop> so like
[08:25:24] <iDevelop> index 0 is like item 1?
[08:25:29] <iDevelop> like php is
[08:25:34] <xKraty> its like a foreach
[08:25:36] <iDevelop> $array[0] = item 1 of my array
[08:25:47] <xKraty> foreach ( $data as $index => $notification )
[08:26:09] <iDevelop> oh
[08:26:14] <iDevelop> I call that a key
[08:26:15] <iDevelop> :P
[08:26:30] <iDevelop> never heard it called an index before
[08:26:35] <xKraty> yeah basically it's key => value
[08:26:46] <rosieres> How do I have to escape my newID here ? -> .after("<div id='newId' ></div>");
[08:27:02] <xKraty> index is intended to be numeric key a string but are the same thing
[08:27:19] <iDevelop> xKraty: thanks
[08:27:34] <xKraty> iDevelop: youAREWELCOME lol
[08:28:01] <xKraty> rosieres: it's fine like that
[08:28:28] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: http://jsbin.com/dobededa/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:28:29] <Uhkis> i'd switch ' and " because single quote html looks horrible ;-)
[08:28:53] <rosieres> xKraty . . . I forgot to mention that myId is a varaible :-)
[08:29:00] <rosieres> variable
[08:29:27] <Uhkis> then you need ..." + newId + "...
[08:29:30] <xKraty> so it's .after('<div id="' + newId + '"></div>')
[08:29:38] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: thanks
[08:29:45] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:29:52] <xKraty> with swapped quotes as Uhkis like
[08:29:52] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: how do I make it live? so when the array updates, it all updates?
[08:30:27] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: That's a whole other can of worms. You can keep checking that url for new notifications or look into polling
[08:30:35] <xKraty> rosieres: if your id come from an user input you should .text() before putting in a var
[08:31:02] <xKraty> got to go! bye!
[08:31:30] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: I want to use $.get
[08:31:32] <iDevelop> I know how it works
[08:31:41] <duch_kazatel> what’s going on now?
[08:31:50] <ankurk_> So I have to add a new column in the table (Damn that table), which can be empty and can have a date too (in string format like this, Feb 28 2014). How can I differentiate between the two? Why i want to do that because I have to sort that as well
[08:32:18] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: but I don't know how to make sure the notifications don't repeat
[08:32:49] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: if you can tell me how to remove all divs inside a div, im sorted!
[08:34:26] <WebJonas> Hi guys!
[08:34:36] <iDevelop> WebJonas: hey
[08:34:53] <rosieres> xKraty: the other way round was it .... thank you -> div id='" + newId + "'
[08:35:05] <WebJonas> Lets say i got 3 divs with classes .nav and i want to appent expanded and to only the div that have been clicked?
[08:35:09] <WebJonas> tried to google my way
[08:35:10] <WebJonas> got
[08:35:17] <WebJonas> 	jQuery(document).on('click', '.acco', {}, function(e){
[08:35:17] <WebJonas> 		console.log('test')
[08:35:17] <WebJonas> 		jQuery.hoard(e, '.grid').toggleClass('expanded');
[08:35:17] <WebJonas> 	});
[08:35:26] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ WebJonas
[08:35:26] <b-ot> WebJonas: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:35:26] <WebJonas> But that puts expanded on every class
[08:35:35] <WebJonas> sry
[08:36:12] <duch_kazatel> WebJonas pop that in a fiddle and then we can help.
[08:36:15] <duch_kazatel> also: brb
[08:36:17] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: Keep an array of their ids or keep only query ones after the last update happened.
[08:36:34] <BillCriswell> or only query ones after the last update happened*

[08:37:27] <hpekdemi1> what could this mean?
[08:37:33] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: with my div, how do I remove all elements inside it?
[08:38:07] <BillCriswell> .html(''), or .empty()
[08:38:11] <BillCriswell> Think it's abotu the same shit.
[08:39:00] <duch_kazatel> weee
[08:39:01] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: ill try it
[08:39:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Gla you weren't around 5 minutes ago.
[08:39:23] <BillCriswell> Glad*
[08:39:31] <duch_kazatel> oh?
[08:39:42] <BillCriswell> I committed a moral sin.
[08:39:45] <duch_kazatel> .each()?
[08:39:57] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[08:40:11] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good.
[08:40:16] <duch_kazatel> i'm in a non-grumpy mood today
[08:40:31] <BillCriswell> Phew.
[08:40:35] <iDevelop> guys
[08:40:38] <duch_kazatel> :D
[08:40:41] <iDevelop> is this how you use settimeout
[08:40:41] <iDevelop> setTimeout(getData, 5);
[08:40:43] <iDevelop> ?
[08:41:00] <BillCriswell> If you wanted 5 milliseconds, yes.
[08:41:00] <iDevelop> and is it seconds? or milliseconds?
[08:41:01] <duch_kazatel> woah why are you polling every 5 ms for something?
[08:41:11] <iDevelop> oh
[08:41:12] <iDevelop> ms??
[08:41:13] <iDevelop> ok
[08:41:39] <iDevelop> *adds three zeros on the end*
[08:41:44] <duch_kazatel> why are you polling like that?
[08:44:34] <duch_kazatel> i think i'm going to give the native firefox dev tools an honest try.
[08:45:31] <wunz> is it possible to run .each only x number of times?
[08:45:55] <wunz> without having to check the iteration value?
[08:46:08] <duch_kazatel> wunz nope.
[08:46:10] <wunz> like .each(3, function()....
[08:46:13] <wunz> will run 3 x
[08:46:17] <wunz> :(
[08:46:22] <wunz> thx duch_kazatel
[08:46:22] <duch_kazatel> wunz just use a native for loop in that case.
[08:46:41] <wunz> but i'm doing: $(xData.responseXML).find("[nodeName='z:row']").each(function(i, val) {
[08:46:55] <wunz> only wanted to loop through the first few nodes
[08:47:02] <wunz> not all 9k+
[08:47:04] <duch_kazatel> how many?
[08:47:10] <BillCriswell> 9k... wow
[08:47:27] <BillCriswell> wunz: You could do .find().slice(0, 3).each
[08:47:43] <wunz> hehe yea, 9k+ x
[08:47:52] <BillCriswell> I'd be way more worried about the 9k.
[08:48:07] <duch_kazatel> are you in control of the server side at all?
[08:48:19] <wunz> well i need to load that data into an array so i can use jquery's autocomplete
[08:48:30] <wunz> duch_kazatel: no
[08:48:40] <wunz> its sharepoint web services that i'm invoking
[08:49:39] <ankurk_> Can I use regex for strings like this? Feb 28 2014
[08:49:53] <duch_kazatel> wunz then do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/CBekt/
[08:50:03] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ you can use regex on strings, period.
[08:50:11] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ what are you trying to do?
[08:50:34] <ankurk_> I had to add a new column in the table (Damn that table), which can be empty and can have a date too (in string format like this, Feb 28 2014). How can I differentiate between the two? Why i want to do that because I have to sort that as well
[08:50:53] <wunz> duch_kazatel: using slice that BillCriswell propose isn't a good way?
[08:51:18] <duch_kazatel> wunz mine i sone of tons of ways :)
[08:51:26] <wunz> ah ok
[08:51:36] <duch_kazatel> *is one of
[08:51:39] <wunz> yea i was doing it the way you were, just wondering if there was an option in each to do it
[08:51:50] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ check out the date object in javascript.
[08:52:24] <duch_kazatel> wunz nope.  i generally reccommend folks avoid using .each() because it's so slow, but it really depends on your needs/wants.
[08:52:49] <ankurk_> Duch_Kazatel: Actually, I did this, new Date($(this).text()).toString() !== "Invalid Date"
[08:52:53] <wunz> gotcha
[08:53:30] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that's one way.
[08:54:08] <ankurk_> yeah, let's see if that works out for sorting that column.
[08:54:27] <WebJonas> Got it no worries :D
[08:54:37] <WebJonas> Any tips on an small jquery slider? :)
[08:54:49] <duch_kazatel> don't use sliders.
[08:55:18] <wunz> duch_kazatel: var $resultSet = $(xData.responseXML).find("[nodeName='z:row']"), i = 0; <<-- never seen , before, you can do such? if so, whats it do?
[08:55:20] <duch_kazatel> they're a usability nightmare.  if you absolutely have to use one, don't make it autoscroll.
[08:55:29] <WebJonas> Its pretty great for displaying many productimages
[08:55:37] <wunz> duch_kazatel = full time jq chan support :)
[08:55:38] <duch_kazatel> WebJonas users ignore them.
[08:56:07] <WebJonas> hmm
[08:56:13] <duch_kazatel> wunz that's setting two vars, one is $resultSet to $(xData.responseXML).find("[nodeName='z:row']"), the other is initialising i.
[08:56:34] <WebJonas> any ideas to display about 5 - 10 product pictures per project ?
[08:56:35] <duch_kazatel> wunz http://jsfiddle.net/CBekt/1/ is basically the same thing.
[08:56:37] <WebJonas> a small grid+
[08:56:40] <wunz> gotcha
[08:57:17] <duch_kazatel> WebJonas is this on a search page?  or on a product specific page?
[08:57:35] <wunz> i suppose its better to init the currentResult var outside the loop so no need so init each time?
[08:57:46] <WebJonas> Specific page
[08:58:05] <WebJonas> Kinda an showcase for a project my customer want to show
[08:58:10] <duch_kazatel> wunz that'd be smart.
[08:58:29] <fabio_> how to remove input by id?
[08:58:33] <duch_kazatel> WebJonas that's easy - do it like amazon and everybody else does it.  have a big old main image, and then thumbnails below it.
[08:58:35] <fabio_> $("input").remove( "#100_24_thumb.jpg" );
[08:58:38] <fabio_> not work
[08:58:50] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ what are you trying to remove?
[08:58:53] <duch_kazatel> the whole input?
[08:59:05] <fabio_> duch_kazatel,  an input identifyed by an id
[08:59:05] <BillCriswell> $("#100_24_thumb.jpg").remove() is probably what you want.
[08:59:14] <duch_kazatel> $("#100_24_thumb.jpg").remove9);
[08:59:15] <BillCriswell> That's the second time I seen someone try that in two days.
[08:59:18] <duch_kazatel> $("#100_24_thumb.jpg").remove();
[08:59:28] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[09:00:14] <wunz> fabio_: $("input[id='100_24_thumb.jpg']").remove()
[09:00:29] <duch_kazatel> if it's an ID, just select it by id.
[09:00:33] <BillCriswell> That's overkill.
[09:00:40] <wunz> i just wnated to input!
[09:00:41] <wunz> :)
[09:00:44] <duch_kazatel> IDs are unique per page, so use the id selector.
[09:00:49] <fabio_> wunz, lets check if it works
[09:00:55] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ don't use that one.
[09:01:00] <wunz> fabio_: don't use it, hehe
[09:01:01] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ that's sloooowwwww...
[09:01:11] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ use the one I gave you.
[09:01:12] <wunz> it loops through all inputs to find that element.
[09:01:37] <fabio_> duch_kazatel,  that was my initial one
[09:01:40] <duch_kazatel> if you use the ID selector it drops into getElementById()
[09:01:40] <fabio_> not work
[09:01:41] <wunz> fabio_: < duch_kazatel> $("#100_24_thumb.jpg").remove(); <<- use that
[09:02:03] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ then your HTML is bad - is #100_24_thumb.jpg really the ID?  if so, is that ID used more than once?
[09:02:15] <iDevelop> BillCriswell:
[09:02:29] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ because your ID is currently invalid.
[09:02:30] <fabio_> duch_kazatel,  let me paste
[09:02:31] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: can I show you the code I worked on by looking at yours and you tell me what im doing wrong?
[09:02:43] <fabio_>   			$("#"+titulo).parent("#teste").remove();
[09:02:43] <iDevelop> i changed my "object" to a json array
[09:02:43] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ fyi, IDs can't start with a number.
[09:02:56] <fabio_> im passing the id with an variable
[09:03:01] <fabio_>   			$("#"+titulo).parent("#teste").remove();
[09:03:16] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ is 100_24_thumb.jpg an example ID?
[09:03:24] <fabio_> ups$("#"+titulo).remove();
[09:03:55] <fabio_> duch_kazatel also the input was generated with jquery with append();
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ and again, is 100_24_thumb.jpg a real-world example?
[09:04:15] <fabio_> duch_kazatel,  yep
[09:04:25] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ IDs can't start with numbers.
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ you need to prepend that with a letter.  this is supposed to change soon, but until then, you're stil.
[09:04:42] <duch_kazatel> *stuck
[09:04:53] <fabio_> okay let me test that
[09:05:08] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't help, setup a jsfiddle
[09:06:40] <decx> sgml specs are pretty ridiculous
[09:06:54] <decx> can't start with a number, but utf symbols are fine
[09:07:09] <decx> .☃ is valid
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah, i never liked that one.
[09:07:36] <duch_kazatel> html5 changes that, but support is wonky.
[09:08:10] <fabio_> duch_kazatel,  still not working with a letter
[09:08:22] <duch_kazatel> fabio_ setup a jsfiddle with some sample markup then.
[09:08:25] <wunz> fabio_: paste html code in jsfiddle
[09:08:33] <wunz> duch_kazatel: how the f do you type fo f'n fast
[09:08:34] <wunz> lol
[09:08:50] <duch_kazatel> :) I used to do data entry.  employment ad transcription at one point.
[09:08:56] <wunz> i shouldve used that mavis beacan typing program back in 1995
[09:09:12] <wunz> ah, i've been on pc since 16, now, 29 and i still hav eto look down at the kb
[09:09:18] <wunz> occasionally
[09:09:29] <duch_kazatel> I do too for special characters.
[09:09:41] <duch_kazatel> but I can 10key like nobody's business.
[09:09:55] <duch_kazatel> tiiime for some code review.
[09:11:53] <duch_kazatel> if you guys think I'm bad in here about some things, you'd hate to see my code rejections.
[09:12:24] <iDevelop> Anyone know if BillCriswell is online?
[09:12:40] <decx> seen 13 min ago
[09:12:52] <duch_kazatel> he was kicking around a while ago.
[09:12:53] <iDevelop> So, highly unlikely?
[09:12:55] <iDevelop> Food maybe?
[09:13:25] <iDevelop> guys
[09:13:29] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[09:13:37] <iDevelop> did jquery originate in the uk or the us?
[09:13:51] <iDevelop> I know it's all over now, but where was its origin?
[09:14:02] <duch_kazatel> the US
[09:14:10] <duch_kazatel> originally made by john resig
[09:14:42] <BillCriswell> I think he's from Boston? Could be wrong.
[09:15:13] <duch_kazatel> New York.
[09:15:17] <duch_kazatel> wait maybe not.
[09:15:18] <wunz> haha duch_kazatel , what do you do?
[09:15:23] <duch_kazatel> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig
[09:15:37] <duch_kazatel> I'm a software developer.
[09:16:02] <wunz> but doing lots of web stuff?
[09:16:33] <duch_kazatel> some.  i pay a lot of attention and retain some stuff well.  i also check a lot of blogs each day.  his is one.
[09:17:53] <duch_kazatel> my specialty is frontend - in browser stuff.
[09:18:19] <iDevelop> Hey look! BillCriswell's back!
[09:18:32] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: what's the problem here? http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/4/edit
[09:21:27] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: You probably want to .append instead of .html
[09:22:50] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: right
[09:24:11] <BillCriswell> Anyone know of a server that generates google maps markers on the fly with like.. custom colors and shit?
[09:24:18] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/7/edit
[09:24:22] <BillCriswell> the ones the charts api loads are terrible.
[09:25:05] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: Why are you testing if data === null?
[09:25:44] <BillCriswell> oh wait duh.
[09:26:01] <BillCriswell> It's not working here in particular because you can't request json from another domain without permission.
[09:26:35] <BillCriswell> Also, value is the notification object, you need to do value.notification_title
[09:27:23] <BillCriswell> Also, you can remove the parsed = $.parseJSON(data); and just do $.getJSON() instead where you're using $.get
[09:27:43] <BillCriswell> s/server/service*
[09:27:46] <duch_kazatel> also also also: you're pulling data every few seconds without checking to see i the last request completed.
[09:27:51] <decx> BillCriswell you can specify an image for the marker in the api
[09:28:12] <iDevelop> im so confused :(
[09:28:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Generating the 100 or so images is no fun haha.
[09:28:55] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/10/edit
[09:29:14] <duch_kazatel> iDevelop you're hitting the server every, what, 3 seconds?  what happens if one hit doesn't actually complete?
[09:29:57] <iDevelop> duch_kazatel: I don't know!? All I do is PHP :(
[09:30:25] <iDevelop> duch_kazatel: I do basics of jquery, fadeout, fadein, toggle etc but this is a whole new thing
[09:30:32] <duch_kazatel> would you use a timer in PHP?
[09:31:14] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:32:10] <Uhkis> in certain situations, yes ;-)
[09:32:42] <duch_kazatel> pfff.
[09:33:50] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: I opened inbound connections to the site
[09:34:07] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: the requests are going in, the console is getting errors
[09:34:42] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://packt.tk/ajax. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://run.jsbin.com' is therefore not allowed access." right?
[09:34:47] <iDevelop> my json array is derped
[09:34:50] <iDevelop> and it's fixed
[09:35:06] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: I fixed that
[09:36:02] <iDevelop> BillCriswell:
[09:36:05] <iDevelop> it worked!!
[09:36:07] <iDevelop> for one of them
[09:36:09] <iDevelop> but it worked!!
[09:36:28] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[09:36:38] <iDevelop> Hey everyone! go look!!
[09:36:39] <iDevelop> http://jsbin.com/maqufogu/10
[09:36:51] <iDevelop> both working
[09:37:16] <BillCriswell> Good stuff.
[09:37:21] <iDevelop> BillCriswell: you rule dude!!
[09:37:21] <BillCriswell> I think I want a taco.
[09:37:27] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: Glad I could help!
[09:37:34] <iDevelop> Never done a notification thing before :))))
[09:37:35] <BillCriswell> BRB.
[09:38:28] <BillCriswell> iDevelop: WHen you're ready you can look into http://socket.io/ instead of requesting the data every 5 seconds.
[09:39:00] <BillCriswell> Which, by the way, you'd want setInterval(getData, 5000) if you want it to happen over and over again.
[09:43:06] <iDevelop> um
[09:43:08] <iDevelop> im stuck
[09:43:10] <iDevelop> it's broken
[09:44:45] <Vivekananda> if I say x = {}; and then x["#one"] = true;  is this okay ? if it is then when I try : if(x['one']){print "hello world"); does not work !!
[09:45:12] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda because x["#one"] and x['one'] aren't the same thing.
[09:45:56] <duch_kazatel> try if(x['#one']){print "hello world");
[09:46:23] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: sorry I meant #one in the second code too :). I did this though $.each(x, function(key , value){ if (value) {print "hello"} ;} ;
[09:46:35] <wunz> hahah this is funny
[09:46:38] <wunz> http://wetindeyng.blogspot.se/2014/02/pretty-girl-seeking-rich-husband-got.html?m=1
[09:46:47] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda then you're doing something wrong.  can you supply a jsfiddle?
[09:47:06] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: you mean the code should work ie syntax wise it is okay right ?
[09:47:26] <MaNI> Are there any jquery (or similar) libraries to 'convert' an html region/selection into 'clipboard friendly' HTML i.e. Turn all CSS formatting into inline formatting etc.
[09:48:29] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda yes.  you're using object property access notation, which allows you to do things like that.
[09:48:29] <wunz> Vivekananda: if(x['one']){print "hello world") << would imply that one needs to have a value
[09:48:41] <wunz> otherwise it wouldn't print hello world
[09:49:15] <duch_kazatel> wunz they have that ;)
[09:49:17] <wunz> its a good way to check if length > 0 || != undef
[09:49:38] <duch_kazatel> wunz actually... it's not.
[09:49:44] <wunz> duch_kazatel: that girl in the article is looking for a rich guy, go for it
[09:49:51] <wunz> shes hot w/some nice looking fake tits
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> pfff.  i'm not rich ;)
[09:50:00] <wunz> at least their a bit too perky for real
[09:50:14] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:50:29] <wunz> why is it not? its better than typing out if length > 0 || != undef || == "", etc
[09:52:29] <iDevelop> If anyone needs jQuery help BillCriswell is amazing as ice-cream! :)
[09:55:22] <wunz> ice cream isn't that amazing. it's fatty.
[09:55:26] <wunz> are you a fatty BillCriswell ?
[09:55:30] <wunz> :) jk
[09:57:25] <BillCriswell> I'm 6' 280! People never believe me when I tell them my weight, though.
[09:57:32] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[09:57:39] <duch_kazatel> though i'm like 260.
[09:57:59] <BillCriswell> I'm told I "carry it well" haha.
[09:58:07] <duch_kazatel> just means you've got the frame for it.
[09:58:10] <duch_kazatel> tht's a good thing.
[09:58:46] <BillCriswell> I agree! I'd still like to find myself at about 250
[09:59:30] <duch_kazatel> i got up to 280 at one point and started working out 5 days a week.  lots of weightlifting, semi-strick diet (lots of calorie counting) and got myself down to around 225 or so.
[09:59:39] <duch_kazatel> *strict
[10:00:22] <BillCriswell> I should leave my laptop at work so I'm forced to do something a little more healthy when I get home.
[10:00:43] <duch_kazatel> i have a buddy that only allows himself to watch his favorite shows while on a treadmill.
[10:01:47] <BillCriswell> That's pretty awesome.
[10:02:03] <BillCriswell> It would keep my brain that always needs to be multitasking in order.
[10:02:45] <duch_kazatel> one of the things i'd like to do this year is get up the balls to stop hiding behind a nick on here.
[10:03:16] <BillCriswell> I just try not to say anything too stupid.
[10:05:42] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I have a complicated piece of code and the parts are workign in it but something is missing . would you care to have a look and tell me if possible
[10:05:50] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda sure.
[10:08:45] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: now my code is a gist and not a fiddle coz it is diffuclt to create a fiddle for it . But there is peculiar thing that happens and I woul dlove to know why. In this code if I put a breakpoint on line 23,24  and also on lines 40-42  I donot get a break on 23-24 at all. But if I remove the breakpoint on 40-42 then the code stops on the 23-24. I wonder why  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9119744
[10:12:26] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda a few thoughts - != and == are bad.  don't use them when possible.
[10:12:33] <Vivekananda> okay
[10:12:35] <Vivekananda> noted
[10:12:41] <Vivekananda> so what do I use then ?
[10:12:45] <duch_kazatel> ===
[10:12:47] <duch_kazatel> and !==
[10:12:52] <duch_kazatel> key =repository= 'o' ) - what is this line trying to do?
[10:13:32] <duch_kazatel> also, line 40 doesn't "wait" for the ajax call to complete, btw.
[10:14:34] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: I am convinced you never leave the jquery irc
[10:14:48] <duch_kazatel> nah, i just parallel process a lot :)
[10:15:04] <Vivekananda> one sec lemme se
[10:15:42] <Vivekananda> which is the key repository line ?
[10:16:19] <Vivekananda> also let me add the on complete for line 40 then
[10:17:01] <duch_kazatel> "the key repository line"?
[10:17:46] <klafka> if i have a bunch of divss that have ids like event324 event543 and i want to bind click to all of them, what would be the appropriate selector? $('[id="event*"]') doesn't seem to work?
[10:17:55] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: ---   key =repository= 'o' ) - what is this line trying to do?
[10:17:59] <Vivekananda> which line is this ?
[10:18:10] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda line 31
[10:18:30] <duch_kazatel> you could have copy/pasted that code, hit ctrl+f on your keyboard, pasted that in, and found it./
[10:18:54] <Vivekananda> sorry a typo
[10:21:34] <Vivekananda> on that line ie line 31 but I inteded it to be key == 'o'
[10:22:08] <duch_kazatel> don't apolgize to me :)
[10:22:14] <duch_kazatel> no need - just pointing out issues.
[10:25:41] <Vivekananda> no I meant sorry for not noticing earlier
[10:25:48] <Vivekananda> so okay do you see the issues ?
[10:26:15] <Vivekananda> is the placement of ; wrong in places ?
[10:28:12] <duch_kazatel> let me look again.
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> line 4 - scope that var.
[10:28:53] <duch_kazatel> your semis look okay.
[10:30:56] <Vivekananda> also how do I add on ajax complete ?
[10:31:04] <duch_kazatel> like you added the error.
[10:31:11] <Vivekananda> but any comments on my peculiar behaviour
[10:33:37] <duch_kazatel> fix all those things first.
[10:33:44] <duch_kazatel> then we'll keep going.
[10:33:44] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:35:07] <djam90> Hey, is anyone here?
[10:36:27] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ djam90
[10:36:28] <b-ot> djam90: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:36:54] <djam90> I have an upload form inside a modal. Is it possible, for when I close the modal, to refresh the page, however, to refresh the Bootstrap tab that was currently active? I have read Stackoverflow answers but they don't seem entirely relevant
[10:37:08] <duch_kazatel> "refresh the page" - define this.
[10:38:07] <djam90> duch_kazatel, well, reload the content in the div to refresh the images to include the uploaded image
[10:38:24] <djam90> I was thinking "reload the page" but I only need the content in the div to be reloaded
[10:38:38] <duch_kazatel> djam90 bind to the close of the modal, and have that fire off an ajax request to the server that fetches the content
[10:38:51] <duch_kazatel> your server will need to be setup to handle that.
[10:39:43] <djam90> Hmm, I use Laravel PHP backend, it loads view pages. In the view there is a div for each tab, so would I just replace the content in the div tab?
[10:40:06] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to create a view for each div that you can call from a URL.
[10:40:49] <djam90> What would the ajax request actually do to make this work? Send back the data to go in the tab?
[10:41:31] <duch_kazatel> that'
[10:41:48] <duch_kazatel> *that'll be the tough part :)
[10:42:47] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, the request would return just the updated data.
[10:42:50] <duch_kazatel> that'd be the best way.
[10:45:05] <djam90> duch_kazatel, The situation is as follows: The page is to edit a property (real estate admin panel), so there are Bootstrap tabs (Main details, Address, Images), in the images tab is the $property_images for that specific property. There is a "Add Images" button that opens a modal. In the modal you can upload images. When closing the modal, I want the newly uploaded images to show
[10:45:38] <duch_kazatel> yup.  so your database has maybe some kind of foreign key that maps images to properties, yeah?
[10:46:07] <djam90> I have properties table, and a property_images table, in Laravel it is a "belongs to" relationship
[10:46:29] <djam90> or a "has many"
[10:46:33] <jwmann> When I do $(".foo").clone(), how can I easily grab the cloned object and perform methods upon it? Chaining methods on clone() doesn't seem to work..
[10:47:31] <djam90> duch_kazatel, so do I need to somehow pass through the specific property to the ajax request, so that the property's images can be returned via ajax and replace the content in the tab?
[10:47:53] <duch_kazatel> mmk.  i'd personally setup a way to request images by property ID and then fire off an ajax get that fetches the list of images.
[10:48:10] <duch_kazatel> remember, you're not fetching the images via ajax, just the links.
[10:48:31] <duch_kazatel> jwmann you can chain methods on clone.
[10:48:58] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: I think I just found the real problem. It wasn't the chaining
[10:49:03] <duch_kazatel> i figured :)
[10:49:58] <djam90> duch_kazatel, Laravel has an ORM called Eloquent that maps the PropertyImages model to the property_images table in the database. When displaying the current property's images on that tab, it shows the thumbnail of the image, along with a caption
[10:50:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm speaking from a platform agnostic angle - the way i'd look at it is like i desribed before.
[10:52:01] <BillCriswell> I wish hitting the up key on a unit in dev tools could also do a .1 increase instead of 1.
[10:52:03] <djam90> duch_kazatel, hmm. a function in PHP that returns an array of property_image ids to be displayed. then just call that function again on modal.close via ajax and update the div
[10:52:15] <duch_kazatel> bill is can in firebug iirc.
[10:52:24] <duch_kazatel> djam90 exactly.
[10:52:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Hmmmm
[10:52:50] <BillCriswell> I should let the Chrome devs know that I want this and they should drop everything and do it immediately.
[10:52:58] <djam90> thanks duch_kazatel, going now to think about it some more before I code some... thanks
[10:54:12] <duch_kazatel> djam90 i have one of the XL moleskine cahiers on my desk just for sketching out that kind of stuff.
[10:54:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What the hell is that
[10:55:06] <BillCriswell> I assumed that was a giant typo lol
[10:55:30] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:55:39] <duch_kazatel> they're big floppy notebooks.  i like the unlined ones.
[10:56:26] <BillCriswell> I sketch UI stuff all the time even though I'm not a UI guy, so the grids would be needed for me.
[10:56:31] <BillCriswell> They look nice though.
[10:56:44] <duch_kazatel> sometimes i just have to draw logic out.
[10:56:48] <duch_kazatel> it's my operations background./
[10:56:50] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:57:07] <nhulea_nsa> does .clone() work pretty well or is there a better wayt o duplicate
[10:57:10] <leofrozenyogurt> hey so im having a very weird problem on a site i am building , sexycards4u.com
[10:57:17] <leofrozenyogurt> when i click one of the categories
[10:57:20] <leofrozenyogurt> and clicka  video
[10:57:27] <leofrozenyogurt> it starts it inthe middle
[10:57:46] <leofrozenyogurt> in ie 10 on windows 7
[10:57:51] <leofrozenyogurt> testing on browserstack
[10:57:56] <leofrozenyogurt> also excuse the hilarious videos
[10:58:00] <leofrozenyogurt> its a clients site not mine
[10:58:48] <Uhkis> it always is ;)
[10:59:11] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: You're asking if .clone() isn't the best tool do duplicate something?
[10:59:42] <Vivekananda> how do I do the on complete thing I mean want to look at ajax
[10:59:46] <BillCriswell> Fuck. I spilled water on myself twice today.
[11:00:12] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: yeah I am try to repeat this imgur api call 5 times or more http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/12/
[11:00:38] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: I wish I could help you "papertowel"
[11:00:46] <Uhkis> leofrozenyogurt: works fine on ie11
[11:01:31] <nhulea_nsa> http://imgur.com/a/O8Ahj
[11:02:01] <leofrozenyogurt> Uhkis: yea i know but the client is insisting for ie 10
[11:02:06] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: In this case you would just do like var html = '<img src="' + imgur + '">'; $('.someEl').append(html);
[11:02:32] <leofrozenyogurt> Uhkis: and its pissing me off why ie 10 wont listen to animate to top
[11:03:54] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: I actually screwed up I dont want to duplicate I need the images to be diff and random so I need to actually have differnet index numbers when run the api call
[11:04:36] <nhulea_nsa>     var id = result.data[num].id; I need [num] to keep changing
[11:04:36] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: You can still just make an html string for that.
[11:05:05] <nhulea_nsa> ok cool let me see
[11:07:11] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: on ajax complete the .done is being called. It is on the .done complete that I wish to chall the line 40
[11:07:33] <leofrozenyogurt> anyone have any idea why that could be happening
[11:07:40] <idiocrash> hi guys
[11:07:52] <ankurk_> Well I might need some help here, now I have a column in my table which can have dates and can be null too, how do I sort that one? http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/5/edit
[11:08:00] <idiocrash> I have a php page with a portion of it being a large html table
[11:08:18] <idiocrash> when user submits web form, the table is currently rebuilt via full page reload
[11:08:29] <idiocrash> but I would like only the table portion to update
[11:08:45] <idiocrash> and I would like to use a spinner animation while loading happens
[11:08:48] <hpekdemi1>  /wc
[11:08:52] <idiocrash> what is the best way to implement a spinner?
[11:10:20] <Vivekananda> idiocrash: ajax would be used for sure
[11:10:26] <Vivekananda> dont know about spinner
[11:11:21] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/13/ I am still getting the same image using append do I need to append everything cause it seems like I am just repeating the same code twice ?
[11:11:45] <idiocrash> Vivekananda: so firstly, I have to ajaxify that HTML table portion of the page. That portion is handled in one php file. But how to I just reload that portion using query?
[11:11:51] <Vivekananda> something here might help idiocrash http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68485/how-to-show-loading-spinner-in-jquery
[11:12:22] <idiocrash> Vivekananda: awesome!
[11:12:22] <Vivekananda> idiocrash: yes and to achieve that you will use jquery/js and ajax function of it.
[11:12:28] <Vivekananda> do you know either ?
[11:12:32] <idiocrash> kinda new there
[11:12:37] <Vivekananda> np
[11:12:40] <idiocrash> but that page looks like it does both
[11:12:41] <Vivekananda> I am pretty new too
[11:12:54] <Vivekananda> yep :) I thought it might help
[11:18:41] <leofrozenyogurt> ok so iv narrowed it down
[11:18:44] <leofrozenyogurt> to the skeuocard form
[11:18:48] <leofrozenyogurt> and when it is initalized
[11:18:52] <leofrozenyogurt> it scrolls to it
[11:18:56] <djam90> Hey duch_kazatel , the content in my images tab is a lot to recreate when the modal closes...
[11:18:57] <leofrozenyogurt> is there anyway to null that?
[11:20:31] <dnsdds> .stop() is supposed to stop a .fadeIn(), right?
[11:21:10] <gordian> guys i'm curious, i still see lots of code snippets that include fallbacks for "browsers without javascript" but it's 2014… why the need?
[11:21:38] <djam90> In bootstrap, is it possible to refresh one single tab via JS
[11:21:57] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: see this worked but I am creating the entire api call again there has to be a better way http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/15/
[11:22:00] <gordian> djam90: no luck with that stackoverflow i linked you to yesterday?
[11:23:06] <gordian> djam90: yesterday you said you wanted to refresh the page and force a specific tab, now you just want to reload a specific tag without an entire page refresh?
[11:25:02] <djam90> gordian, I looked into the stackoverflow link, and numerous other pages linked from it, but they seem to address the issue of loading a page on a tab, but not RELOADING the page with that particular tab... so I guess it is easier to refresh a specific tag?
[11:25:23] <duch_kazatel> gordian accessibility
[11:25:32] <duch_kazatel> irt your question about noscript.
[11:25:55] <gordian> djam90: you want $.load();
[11:27:31] <gordian> djam90: example: http://pastebin.com/YeCdEEi4
[11:27:36] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: hey is there a way to get 5 different links here ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/16/
[11:27:49] <nhulea_nsa> its basically duplicating the links ?
[11:27:56] <gordian> duch_kazatel: like how?
[11:28:21] <duch_kazatel> gordian if you're blind?
[11:28:46] <gordian> uhhhhh
[11:28:47] <nhulea_nsa> I am blind
[11:28:53] <gordian> no you're not
[11:28:53] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa really?
[11:28:59] <nhulea_nsa> no
[11:29:01] <nhulea_nsa> haha
[11:29:22] <duch_kazatel> gordian a lot of blind folks or people with alternative pointing devices have a hard time with a lot of the things we add with javascript and so prefer to not have javascript enabled, or otherwise use browsers that don't have javascript.
[11:29:27] <nhulea_nsa> there is no way to code if your blind ?
[11:29:45] <duch_kazatel> there's a way to code if you're blind, but i'm talking about usability, not developing.
[11:29:47] <nhulea_nsa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/118984/how-can-you-program-if-youre-blind
[11:30:01] <duch_kazatel> there was a blind dev in here a few months back.
[11:30:06] <duch_kazatel> it was interesting stuff.
[11:30:23] <nhulea_nsa> thast awesome
[11:30:34] <nhulea_nsa> makes me feel more lame thanks
[11:30:49] <gordian> so we're building a visual medium for people who can't see?
[11:30:50] <gordian> nice
[11:31:00] <nhulea_nsa> its called music
[11:31:05] <gordian> how do blind people watch porn?
[11:31:09] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily visual.  just usable.
[11:31:11] <gordian> just listen?
[11:31:32] <duch_kazatel> yahoo has an entire group dedicated to usability.
[11:31:57] <duch_kazatel> (note that's not the only reason people have noscript in their shit, but that might be one reason)
[11:32:02] <gordian> what's yahoo?
[11:32:21] <duch_kazatel> you're joking.
[11:32:23] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: You'd have to look into imgurs api to request more than one image I'd imagine if you don't want to make 5 separate calls.
[11:32:37] <gordian> that was more of a comment than a question
[11:33:11] <nhulea_nsa> yeah I just need [num] to change it seems my function sets that number to be the same every time ?
[11:34:50] <djam90> gordian, how does that code work? What does .load() do?
[11:35:11] <duch_kazatel> djam90 it's a convenience method for $.ajax(); - go check out the docs.
[11:35:19] <gordian> djam90: https://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:35:21] <djam90> will do
[11:35:33] <nhulea_nsa> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/17/ BillCriswell see check the console its the same id everytime
[11:37:05] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: do console.log(result) in yrou handleData
[11:37:43] <nhulea_nsa> oh wow there like 50 or so in there
[11:38:09] <gordian> when using $.load() on a single element like this http://pastebin.com/YeCdEEi4 does the entire page actually load but only the matched element is replaced? if so then where are the page contents stored and what happens to them when the matched element is replaced?
[11:38:34] <duch_kazatel> gordian huh?
[11:38:41] <gordian> nevermind found that in the docs myself
[11:38:51] <duch_kazatel> was about to say... lol
[11:39:01] <gordian> "When this method executes, it retrieves the content of ajax/test.html, but then jQuery parses the returned document to find the element with an ID of container. This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID of result, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded."
[11:39:17] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[11:39:21] <duch_kazatel> probably within a document fragment.
[11:39:24] <gordian> so i'm wondering where the entire page is stored?
[11:39:34] <gordian> initially, before it's discarded
[11:39:40] <duch_kazatel> ^^ a document fragment
[11:39:54] <Vivekananda> <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: on ajax complete the .done is being called. It is on the .done complete that I wish to chall the line 40
[11:40:26] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda re-link?
[11:40:28] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: Right, so http://jsfiddle.net/PKSLj/18/
[11:41:05] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/cbSQO.jpg lol
[11:41:45] <BillCriswell> Firefox dev tools are being so weird.
[11:42:14] <duch_kazatel> that's why i use firebug.  i gave up.
[11:43:25] <BillCriswell> I'm doing things in dev tools that should be effecting styles and it's just sitting there like I didn't click anything,
[11:43:36] <gordian> BillCriswell: why you posting my personal pics on here brah
[11:44:06] <BillCriswell> gordian: Sorry, but it's just the sickest bookbox i ever saw.
[11:44:06] <nhulea_nsa> nice speakers
[11:44:51] <gordian> thank you
[11:45:13] <gordian> damn thing cost me $3
[11:45:19] <gordian> better be 1337
[11:45:23] <djam90> gordian, does using .load() on the $('#tab-1') make the ajax refresh just that tab?
[11:45:32] <gordian> djam90: no
[11:45:56] <gordian> the first selector you use is where the new content that's retrieved will be inserted
[11:46:22] <gordian> then the selector used as the .load() argument will be retrieved and placed into that first selector
[11:47:07] <gordian> http://pastebin.com/YeCdEEi4
[11:50:16] <jackmcbarn> is there a way, given two arbitrary elements in the dom, to see which is first in document order?
[11:50:50] <djam90> gordian, I am confused, sorry :(   can you explain it left to right?
[11:50:58] <gordian> i just did
[11:51:06] <gordian> and also read the docs
[11:51:27] <djam90> oh sorry
[11:51:31] <djam90> im reading it now
[11:51:42] <djam90> i read your answer wrong
[11:52:05] <gordian> https://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[11:52:34] <djam90> omg that is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:52:42] <djam90> I didn't know jQuery could do that
[11:52:55] <djam90> I've used load() a long time ago but didn't know it could do that
[11:53:15] <gordian> now you know
[11:53:17] <gordian> enjoy
[11:53:17] <djam90> what does this do: #tab-1:eq(0) > *'
[11:53:32] <djam90> the first element
[11:53:41] <gordian> READ teh docs brah
[11:53:45] <djam90> eq(0) is first element, greater than *
[11:53:48] <djam90> will do
[11:53:50] <gordian> "jQuery uses the browser's .innerHTML property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as <html>, <title>, or <head> elements. As a result, the elements retrieved by .load() may not be exactly the same as if the document were retrieved directly by the browser."
[11:55:24] <gordian> you can try it without that bit and you'll see why
[11:55:26] <djam90> thanks gordian, what is the > * for?
[11:55:27] <djam90> oh
[11:55:28] <djam90> ok
[11:55:53] <gordian> because without the ':eq(0) > *' jQuery will simply reinsert the entire #tab-1
[11:56:00] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: one sec
[11:56:03] <gordian> and you will end up with a #tab-1 inside of another #tab-1
[11:56:35] <gordian> so that selector makes sure you're only loading all child elements of #tab-1
[11:56:57] <gordian> try it with and without if you don't understand
[11:58:27] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I Have changed the code a bit and moved the lines up to 30 31 in here https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9119744
[11:58:51] <Vivekananda> I am sorry duch_kazatel it is 34 -
[12:00:18] <djam90> gordian, I have tried it with and without and I get the same result: that is, it seems to reload the tab, but javascript gets weird, for example the dropzone.js area in the modal is not working, and my XEditable stops working
[12:00:35] <gordian> djam90: link?
[12:00:39] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you're running an each within an each... that looks wrong.
[12:02:06] <djam90> gordian, i have no link, its localhost, part of an admin panel built in laravel and bootstrap
[12:02:17] <djam90> there aren't any JS errors or anything in console
[12:02:21] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda i have to tend to some other work.  sorry.
[12:02:29] <gordian> apologies then, this is as far as i go, gotta toggle some work here
[12:03:16] <gordian> but if your JS stops working it's because your event listeners may not be setup correctly
[12:03:27] <gordian> you'll want to use $.on()
[12:03:54] <djam90> $('#addImageModal').on('hidden.bs.modal', function (e) {
[12:03:54] <djam90> 	$('#images').load(window.location.href + ' #images');//:eq(0) > *');
[12:03:54] <djam90> });
[12:04:29] <gordian> da fuh?
[12:04:49] <shoky> o.O
[12:04:51] <djam90> thats my code, using .on
[12:06:37] <gordian> you need to be using $.on() for the elements that use dropzone.js
[12:06:48] <gordian> how are you initializing dropzone?
[12:06:58] <gordian> if it's more than one line then use pastebin.com for goodness sake
[12:07:46] <djam90> sorry, a bit new to asking, will do
[12:08:51] <djam90> dropzone is initialised automatically and looks for class="dropzone"
[12:08:51] <djam90>  in a form
[12:08:53] <wunz> whats the diff in using: .bind .on .live and then methods .click .keyup .keydown, etc?
[12:09:02] <wunz> which is the best way to capture an event
[12:09:14] <wunz> and why the million diff ways to do so?
[12:09:20] <shoky> all of those are shortcuts to .on
[12:09:27] <djam90> alternatively, I can initialise dropzone using: $("div#myId").dropzone({ url: "/file/post" });
[12:09:30] <wunz> incl .bind ?
[12:09:32] <shoky> yes
[12:09:35] <wunz> thx
[12:09:48] <shoky> also .delegate
[12:09:50] <gordian> djam90: then you'll need to reinit dropzone in the tab after it's loaded (as a callback)
[12:10:10] <djam90> I guess, same for other JS libs like X-Editable
[12:10:33] <gordian> prolly
[12:11:02] <djam90> thanks man, appreciate the help
[12:12:07] <ankurk_> Can any one help me with this jsbin? http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/12/edit
[12:12:13] <ankurk_> Sort is not working
[12:12:26] <ankurk_> I used the code snippet from http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/1178/sorting-dates-handling-null-values/p1
[12:15:39] <ankurk_> I basically want the sorted out dates on top and null columns at the botton
[12:15:44] <ankurk_> *bottom
[12:16:24] <BillCriswell> max-height in firefox is goofy.
[12:16:37] <gordian> how can i save a string to a variable and have it treated as a dom object?
[12:17:01] <gordian> like if i want to manually create an anchor tag and then change its href attribute
[12:17:02] <BillCriswell> got var $html = $(string);
[12:17:13] <BillCriswell> gordian: ^
[12:17:18] <gordian> got var?
[12:17:34] <BillCriswell> No, it should have auto completed.
[12:17:38] <gordian> ahh
[12:17:41] <gordian> ok i'll try it out
[12:17:58] <BillCriswell> var $a = $('<a/>'); $a.attr('href', 'http://www.google.com'); $a.text('Google');
[12:20:00] <djam90> gordian, thank you a million. the script now works. it reloads the tab after image uploads in the modal. works amazing. dropzone and x-editable are reinitialised. my last question is, the final part, :eq(0) > *, when missing, doesn't cause it to load twice
[12:20:30] <gordian> ignore it at your own peril then
[12:21:27] <djam90> nah I believe you, just want to understand how it works :)
[12:21:54] <Siecje> how to use arrow keys to navigate a html table
[12:27:01] <djam90> gordian, is there any reason why the page refresh thing doesn't work if I have already sent an ajax call once (to do X-Editable)
[12:27:25] <gordian> i haven't seen your code but i'm sure there's a reason
[12:30:05] <djam90> In bootstrap, when you hide a modal (hidden.bs.modal), can this happen twice? Should I do anything different when doing it twice? Because the tab refresh works, but only once
[12:30:43] <Vivekananda> Hey everyone my code a.js calls function b.js and all calling goes fine but in box 2 line 3 something weird happens. I have posted firebug's output and not sure why this is happening  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9119744
[12:30:50] <djam90> I put alert(1) in the callback, and it works the first time but not the second time I close a modal
[12:32:48] <Vivekananda>  my code a.js calls function b.js and all calling goes fine but in box 2 line 3 something weird happens. I have posted firebug's output and not sure why this is happening  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9119744
[12:32:53] <Vivekananda> sorry
[12:33:54] <Kricir> Can someone help me out with a javascript problem, http://pastie.org/8753183 All I am trying to do is reload the image based on the input fields to build a googlemaps api, but I am freezing on line 55 when I try to change the src?
[12:35:11] <djam90> gordian, Can you use .load() twice? for example, closing the modal a second time
[12:35:48] <djam90> Ah, I bet it doesn't load my script file in again
[12:35:49] <gordian> no way bro, if you use .load() more than once your computer will self destruct
[12:36:10] <djam90> I think the problem is that my script file is lost after the refresh
[12:36:18] <gordian> put your code on pastebin
[12:36:22] <gordian> let me see it
[12:36:26] <gordian> your load()
[12:36:32] <gordian> show me your load() big boy
[12:36:47] <Velveeta> gordian: they changed the API in 1.8, you can pass a selfdestruct: false option into it now
[12:36:48] <djam90> http://pastebin.com/Skm3pcxS
[12:37:02] <gordian> Velveeta: good to know!
[12:37:02] <djam90> lol
[12:37:02] <Velveeta> it's undocumented, though
[12:37:03] <Vivekananda> nvermind figured it out!
[12:37:14] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: why is it whenever I see you I figure stuff out
[12:37:22] <Vivekananda> couldnt you stick aroun dlonger
[12:37:31] <Vivekananda> at the right times :)
[12:37:40] <Velveeta> i'm always in here... i can maybe write a script to just pop up every 10 seconds and say "oh hai!"
[12:37:50] <Vivekananda> nope
[12:37:52] <Vivekananda> not always
[12:37:54] <Velveeta> well, that's a lie, i'm always in here when my laptop isn't asleep
[12:38:05] <Vivekananda> I did not see even see for last 3 days
[12:38:08] <Vivekananda> no hi or anything
[12:38:28] <Vivekananda> I just figured a stupid thing out and now I have it :)
[12:38:32] <Velveeta> i jump in at random times
[12:38:33] <Uhkis> Vivekananda: you need to start hilighting him
[12:39:02] <Velveeta> i wait for the perfect questions to jump in at, when somebody says "what's a 'javascript'?" and then i come to the rescue so i look like the resident genius
[12:39:09] <Uhkis> haha
[12:39:23] <Vivekananda> I will request his permission before I would and along with it will request him to tell me if he is busy before he becomes annoyed at my highlights and call the channel mod
[12:39:36] <Vivekananda> I suffered this once and honestly had no clue someone was miffed
[12:39:53] <Vivekananda> like not even a 0 percent clue and so I am wary of irc sometimes
[12:40:27] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta that's my gag!
[12:42:26] <Velveeta> vivekananda: you can always feel free to ping me in here by name.. sometimes it takes me a little bit to notice it, and if i *am* too busy at the time, i'll just let you know
[12:42:30] <BillCriswell> I can't believe what I need to do to get firefox to honor a max-height right now.
[12:42:38] <Vivekananda> that is better
[12:42:49] <Vivekananda> thanks Velveeta
[12:42:51] <Velveeta> but i'm pretty good about task-switching, so i can spew out some knowledge, flip back over to a work window, flip back over to check for followup questions, flip back to work, etc
[12:42:57] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:43:15] <Uhkis> mad alt-tab skills
[12:43:30] <Vivekananda> if only eclipse had a nice way of refactoring code so that if I changed a method signature then all places that
[12:43:32] <gordian> djam90: try this instead: http://pastebin.com/7tyYfshk
[12:43:45] <gordian> i commented the first line and replaced it with what should work
[12:43:51] <Vivekananda> the method was being called would come up one after the other and ask me to input a new argument there
[12:46:33] <djam90> gordian, with that line of code instead, the script doesn't work at all
[12:46:53] <gordian> shoot one mistake
[12:46:55] <gordian> try this one: http://pastebin.com/RtsZa89X
[12:48:34] <djam90> thats working! nice one thanks. Why does it work with document.on?
[12:49:04] <duch_kazatel> event delegation
[12:49:29] <duch_kazatel> try to bind to something a little deeper than document if possible.
[12:50:38] <djam90> duch_kazatel, you answering my question?
[12:50:42] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:51:35] <gordian> djam90: read the $.on() docs
[12:51:45] <djam90> i will read up on event delegation... gordian I will do, thanks so much for the help
[12:52:02] <gordian> np
[12:52:22] <gordian> well it was a p, but no big deal
[12:52:32] <duch_kazatel> basically, almost all events, when fired, "bubble up" through the document.  instead of binding many event listeners to specic nodes, you can bind fewer listeners to parent nodes that wait for a child event to bubble up.
[12:52:34] <djam90> lol
[12:53:12] <duch_kazatel> this is cool because you can add/remove children and not worry about your event bindings.
[13:04:22] <loktar> terriblesarcasm: you forgot some
[13:04:32] <loktar> posts is undefined
[13:05:14] <terriblesarcasm> loktar: Unfortunately it's coming from facebook API and it won't work via the jsfiddle domain regardless of whether the code is there or not, should I just prepopulate some?
[13:05:31] <loktar> yeah
[13:05:37] <wunz> is there an autocomplete for jquery on sublimetext?
[13:07:41] <duch_kazatel> wunz install package control and then install one.
[13:09:38] <ankurk_> Why do I feel stupid when no one answers me on IRC? :P
[13:09:41] <ankurk_> Why do I feel stupid when no one answers me on IRC? :P
[13:09:47] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ what was the question?
[13:09:52] <loktar> I feel stupider when I double type
[13:09:54] <duch_kazatel> also - there was a netsplit.
[13:16:43] <terriblesarcasm> loktar: It still doesn't seem to be working although I think I have defined posts: http://jsfiddle.net/a3RxE/2/
[13:19:41] <terriblesarcasm> loktar: fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/a3RxE/3/
[13:22:02] <kev999> hi all - anyone know a simple expression for nextuntil that hides everything upto selector1 OR selector2 ??
[13:23:02] <decx> terriblesarcasm your tr aren't actually appended into the table
[13:24:38] <kev999> hi all - anyone know a simple expression for nextuntil that hides everything upto selector1 OR selector2 ??
[13:25:15] <terriblesarcasm> decx: why is that?
[13:25:48] <decx> you are appending to #maincontent, you do the same with you posts, that doesn'T actually fill the table
[13:27:05] <BillCriswell> kev999: selector1,selector2
[13:27:59] <BillCriswell> The Pulp Fiction soundtrack is timeless.
[13:30:12] <terriblesarcasm> decx: Why would they not be appending in the order given though? It runs <table></table> even though the </table> should be after
[13:30:12] <terriblesarcasm> after the posts*
[13:30:12] <kev999> any gurus out there to help with a simple nextuntil question - see above ^^
[13:30:12] <terriblesarcasm> I suppose I could add it all to a variable and THEN append the entire thing, what would be a better solution?
[13:30:34] <BillCriswell> kev999: I answered you.
[13:30:48] <BillCriswell> $('.div').nextUntil('.class1,class2')
[13:32:44] <kev999> Hi Bill - tried that - it seems to be omitting the second selector - I'll post - see if you can see anything wrong
[13:32:46] <kev999> BillCriswell - $(this).nextUntil('tr:has(td[style*="12"]),tr[style*="back"]')
[13:32:46] <decx> terriblesarcasm check you markup in the inspector, it's like this <table></table> <tr><td> content conten <tr><td> content content. ... it's a miracle this actually shows up ;)
[13:32:47] <decx> better way would be to ditch tables if you don't need them
[13:32:52] <terriblesarcasm> decx: Yea, I know that's the issue I don't know why that's happening though
[13:33:29] <jquery787> Hey does anyone have any tools for debugging performance?  Im using jquery data tables with some jquery operations for a table of 4,000 and getting bad performance
[13:33:45] <jquery787> I know its probbably in firebug somewhere Im just not finding it, need like a new relic style breakdown of the operations
[13:34:13] <decx> terriblesarcasm #maincontent is a div, everytime you use $('#maincontent').append(stuff) it adds that to the end of that container,
[13:34:57] <terriblesarcasm> but if <table> was appended to the end of it, why would the next line not be appended to the end of it, being able to then dynamically create a table?
[13:35:39] <decx> because you're adding <table></table>
[13:35:45] <guideX> anyone know how to listen for a key change event with ckeditor? i've also installed the onchange plugin, but it only works the first onchnage
[13:37:45] <terriblesarcasm> decx: that's the thing though, that's not how it is in my code
[13:38:16] <kev999> BillCriswell - feeling pretty dumb - forgot to include the same multiple selector in both of the 'toggle'  routines - now working thanks for your help
[13:38:17] <BillCriswell> kev999: http://jsbin.com/buzuriwi/1/edit?html,css,js,output works here
[13:38:36] <BillCriswell> kev999: Ah ok awesome haha
[13:38:37] <decx> when you do html('<table>') jquery assumes this is an object, it's not advisable to patchwork your markup together like you want to
[13:38:43] <BillCriswell> Was just mocking up an example for ou
[13:39:05] <kev999> BillCriswell - just seen your last post sorry to put you to the trouble - appreciate your help
[13:39:32] <guideX> nevermind
[13:39:37] <BillCriswell> kev999: No problem at all.
[13:41:08] <terriblesarcasm> decx: what would be more advisable, not needing to use a table, to organize things
[13:45:39] <decx> instead of appending everything to the dom separately you can create a "virtual object" first to hold all your stuff
[13:45:45] <decx> then when you're done you can append that
[13:45:53] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/a3RxE/4/
[13:46:43] <duch_kazatel> fun fact - that's not just in memory!
[13:46:55] <decx> yeah i wasnt that sure
[13:46:58] <duch_kazatel> that's a full document fragment.  it's a document you can't see.
[13:46:59] <decx> where is it exaclty
[13:47:08] <duch_kazatel> it's in the browser but not currently visible.
[13:47:11] <decx> so virtual object is a better description
[13:47:28] <duch_kazatel> that implies it's not really an object - it is.
[13:47:36] <decx> oh right, document fragment
[13:47:37] <duch_kazatel> document fragments are a real part of the DOM api.
[13:47:42] <decx> ye got it
[13:47:50] <BillCriswell> I just spend longer debugging firefox than IE8. ='(
[13:48:50] <duch_kazatel> really?
[13:48:54] <duch_kazatel> firebug is a thing.
[13:49:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah I installed it. Helped, but the big issue with max-height.
[13:49:18] <decx> oh you want a beautiful firefox fail?
[13:49:21] <decx> mom
[13:49:23] <decx> got a beauty
[13:49:50] <terriblesarcasm> Thanks decx
[13:50:00] <BillCriswell> decx: What happened?
[13:50:09] <decx> damnit cant find the fiddle ^^
[13:50:10] <duch_kazatel> there was a problem with max-height?
[13:50:11] <duch_kazatel> pfff
[13:51:25] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/J5LfV/
[13:51:42] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Firefox was ignoring max height on an image in an absolutely positioned div, so I had to explicitly set a height on the parent, but I have to do it through JS because it's fluid vertically as well as horizontal.
[13:52:00] <decx> even though both sets of elements have the same width, firefox breaks the first one
[13:52:17] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[13:52:51] <decx> all li are 41 px
[13:52:58] <decx> all ul 82
[13:53:07] <decx> one breaks, the other doesn't
[13:53:18] <decx> works in chrome though
[13:53:24] <jwmann> I'm trying to wrap my brain around trying to get this type of JSON format but I'm drawing a huge blank, could someone help me out with this? :( - http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/
[13:53:24] <duch_kazatel> decx that's actually an issue about layout.
[13:53:45] <duch_kazatel> decx the issue is where one element ends and the other begins.
[13:54:20] <decx> i noticed when i wanted a float without specified width
[13:54:36] <decx> having to set one for every element is cumbersome
[13:54:49] <decx> damn you firefox, but i still love you ^^
[13:56:02] <kev999> don't know the background to what's being discussed - but don't you have to style display block to stop inline elements breaking - sorry to butt in
[13:56:44] <BillCriswell> No need to worry about that here kev999 haha
[13:56:57] <BillCriswell> li is block by default though.
[13:57:48] <nhulea_nsa> hi
[13:57:52] <decx> well i would use inline-block but whitespace is a bitch and flex isnt that well supported
[13:58:16] <kev999> choose nt to break whitespace ?
[14:01:48] <kev999> Just in case your trying to achieve an unordered list that doesn't break layout I style the UL to block, float LI elements left and use a sacraficial (and last) LI emement to perform a clearFloat (clear=both). Height 0, line-height 0 etc etc
[14:02:17] <decx> na you can just use .clearfix on ul
[14:02:29] <decx> good old clearfix
[14:02:44] <decx> or overflow: hidden on ul if you don't need it
[14:02:47] <decx> works just as well
[14:02:52] <kev999> on the last LI element not the UL - am I still wrong ?
[14:02:57] <decx> on the ul
[14:03:12] <decx> you want the parent to contain the float
[14:03:24] <duch_kazatel> kev999 on the ul - adding in extra markup like that isn't necessary and is painful.
[14:03:46] <kev999> so am I - so they say :-)
[14:04:16] <BillCriswell> Day 2 of stand up desk complete.
[14:04:24] <decx> kev999 if i cant use overflow: hidden on the parent i use: .clearfix:before, .clearfix:after { content: "\0020"; display: block; height: 0; overflow: hidden; } .clearfix:after { clear: both; } .clearfix { zoom: 1; }
[14:05:15] <kev999> copy .... literally
[14:05:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:05:44] <decx> i thinkthat's from boilerplate
[14:06:51] <duch_kazatel> neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetspliiiiiiiiiiiiit
[14:07:26] <BillCriswell> They're getting really snnoying.
[14:07:30] <BillCriswell> annoying even*
[14:07:42] <decx> had to turn of j/p messages
[14:07:45] <decx> off
[14:07:59] <terriblesarcasm> yeah, it makes it hard to follow things
[14:08:01] <duch_kazatel> quick, flood #freenode and ask why.
[14:08:07] <jwmann> Wow, such net splits..
[14:08:16] <guideX> yeah keeps freezing my irc client
[14:08:23] <guideX> need to end task and restart etc
[14:08:35] <jwmann> That sounds rough
[14:08:40] <decx> yikes, maybe time for a new client ^^
[14:08:42] <jwmann> My client handles it fine.
[14:08:45] <guideX> yeah my client doesn't handle floods very well
[14:08:57] <jwmann> I'm using Colloquy
[14:08:59] <guideX> well channel ones anyways
[14:09:06] <guideX> i'm using nexirc 3.24
[14:09:25] <decx> mirc -.-
[14:09:39] <jwmann> I remember using mirc
[14:09:49] <jwmann> First time ever using IRC ever
[14:09:51] <jwmann> I was so confused
[14:09:53] <jwmann> xD
[14:09:54] <guideX> I stopped using mirc because of the annoying nags
[14:09:56] <decx> wouldn't know how to script anywhere else
[14:09:57] <BillCriswell> I stole so much music using mIRC.
[14:10:00] <guideX> which is why I wrote my own, etc
[14:10:12] <terriblesarcasm> im using webchat lol
[14:10:22] <BillCriswell> terriblesarcasm: I used that for a while! I dig it.
[14:10:30] <BillCriswell> Using limechat now.
[14:10:31] <terriblesarcasm> it was handling the flood fine but it made reading hard lol
[14:11:32] <jwmann> Can anybody help me with my JSON predicament? xP
[14:11:41] <duch_kazatel> jwmann relink?
[14:11:45] <nhulea_nsa> hey how come my demo doesnt work in firefox ?
[14:11:50] <jwmann> I'm trying to wrap my brain around trying to get this type of JSON format but I'm drawing a huge blank, could someone help me out with this? :( - http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/
[14:11:52] <nhulea_nsa> http://eyahuska.com/draw_image/
[14:11:52] <jwmann> ^
[14:12:06] <terriblesarcasm> decx: Would there be any advantage/disadvantage to using an unordered list instead of the divs you created?
[14:12:07] <nhulea_nsa> works in ie and chrome ?
[14:12:23] <jaCen915> Hi all, has anyone had an issue where jquery ajax() returns JSON data but returns a value boolean as an empty string?     {eliteStatus:true} on the raw data…but console.log shows eliteStatus as ""
[14:12:52] <duch_kazatel> works for me.
[14:12:53] <decx> terriblesarcasm no just use ul for the parent and li for the rows, makes more sense anyway now that i think about it
[14:12:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah, works ehre as well.
[14:13:26] <BillCriswell> I saw human skin and animal fur peek out and get real nervous.
[14:13:29] <terriblesarcasm> decx: My first thought was divs also, I found the UL on ted talks page and that's where I got it from lol
[14:13:31] <nhulea_nsa> you got it to work in ff?
[14:13:36] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[14:13:43] <nhulea_nsa> huh?
[14:13:47] <nhulea_nsa> weird
[14:13:48] <decx> ff win here works as well
[14:13:49] <duch_kazatel> just worked.
[14:14:08] <Velveeta_> duch_kazatel: as the core services architect at our company, i like to say that this is our seal of approval: http://www.wiliam.com.au/content/upload/blog/worksonmymachine.jpg
[14:14:21] <blakespot> So
[14:14:23] <nhulea_nsa> then I am not sure I think I am going install ff again or something
[14:14:25] <BillCriswell> Velveeta_: hahaha
[14:14:36] <duch_kazatel> i have a shirt that says "works on my machine, fool" with a picture of Mr T.
[14:14:51] <Velveeta_> nice
[14:15:01] <nhulea_nsa> you guys are awesome !
[14:15:03] <blakespot> $('#mydiv').slideToggle('fast');
[14:15:11] <nhulea_nsa> fool
[14:15:12] <jwmann> nhulea_nsa: I have no idea what's going on - http://d.pr/i/LT04/8pOjRvYW
[14:15:13] <blakespot> Is there a way to read the toggle state of the item?
[14:15:29] <blakespot> I need to also change text color on a header depending on the toggle state of the hidden div
[14:15:49] <nhulea_nsa> jwmann: best one ive seen yet
[14:16:00] <blakespot> I tried to check color and use that as the clue, but some browser return #fff some return rgb(255, 255, 255)
[14:16:04] <blakespot> oy
[14:16:17] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Any ideas? :X
[14:16:44] <duch_kazatel> Blacksheep check an attribute - make one called like "data-toggle-state" or something.
[14:16:50] <duch_kazatel> or look at the CSS
[14:17:13] <decx> dont even need an attribute for data
[14:17:28] <duch_kazatel> shit, yeah just do it as a .data()
[14:18:20] <blakespot> I have one func that this toggle statement is in - one called for both onmouseover onmouseout
[14:18:27] <blakespot> you saying use a variable flag?
[14:18:46] <duch_kazatel> or attach data to the node.
[14:18:50] <blakespot> lots of elemeents on page to be toggled, can't use a global flag
[14:19:04] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with .data()?
[14:19:07] <blakespot> can you expand on that idea a bit - I am not familiar with attaching data to a node
[14:19:12] <blakespot> thanks
[14:19:24] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[14:19:32] <duch_kazatel> $('#myThing').data('toggledOn', true);
[14:19:36] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[14:19:40] <duch_kazatel> then read the value.
[14:20:10] <decx> $('#mydiv').slideToggle().data('toggled',!$('#mydiv').data('toggled')) may work ;)
[14:20:19] <duch_kazatel> shit there you go.
[14:20:20] <duch_kazatel> I like that.
[14:20:29] <decx> maybe a bit more cahcing ^^
[14:21:20] <blakespot> hmm I'll try it
[14:21:21] <nhulea_nsa> later bill
[14:21:25] <decx> bye bill
[14:21:35] <blakespot> thanks
[14:21:36] <duch_kazatel> bill's been gone for a while :)
[14:21:45] <decx> damn missing j/p messages
[14:21:47] <decx> ^^
[14:21:54] <nhulea_nsa> haha
[14:22:01] <duch_kazatel> i keep 'em on so I can be a smug prick/
[14:22:19] <nhulea_nsa> thats the only way !
[14:23:22] <blakespot> decx: Would that work in an if statement? I am trying to do a few things depending on the toggle state
[14:24:01] <blakespot> This handles the graphical reveal / hide of the div (literal code):
[14:24:01] <duch_kazatel> blakespot you can do $('#myDiv').data('toggled') to get the value.
[14:24:04] <blakespot> $('#'+baseId+'Text').slideToggle("fast");
[14:24:13] <blakespot> but I want to do some other things too depending on state
[14:24:25] <blakespot> ah great
[14:24:40] <decx> you can do if ($('#mydiv').data('toggle')) anywhere
[14:24:46] <decx> toggled*
[14:26:17] <blakespot> decx so I would call: $('#mydiv').slideToggle().data('toggled',!$('#mydiv').data('toggled'))
[14:26:21] <blakespot> in addition to:
[14:26:31] <blakespot> $('#mydiv').slideToggle('fast');
[14:26:47] <blakespot> the latter doing the anim / reveal, the former just attaching data?
[14:26:52] <decx> the slidetoggle is in there already
[14:26:57] <decx> just add fast
[14:26:57] <blakespot> sorry to be all wet behind ear
[14:28:05] <jwmann> Bah, damn this. I need a coffee.
[14:29:07] <blakespot> thanks
[14:30:29] <MarGul> I just cant get my jquery to work. Here is my code, it should explain it all, http://pastebin.com/zZLcNX31 . If I type echo "Hello"; in username_check.php it will echo it. Its like my keyup functions doesnt work. Can anyone see the problem?
[14:31:08] <duch_kazatel> MarGul any errors in the console?
[14:31:39] <duch_kazatel> MarGul fyi your code isn't valid :)
[14:32:17] <MarGul> duch_kazatel: Do not know how I check that. Inspect element and then check? And yeah I just saw that my code isnt valid because i forgot to remove the ; ?> from my code. that shouldnt be there and it still doesnt work ;/
[14:32:36] <duch_kazatel> open the console
[14:33:03] <duch_kazatel> $.post('Functions/username_check.php') { username: register.username.value }, - what do you expect this to do?
[14:33:47] <MarGul> grab the value thats inputted in the textbox username. Assign it with post to Functions/username_check.php as a variable username
[14:34:04] <duch_kazatel> that... is not that that does.
[14:34:20] <decx> works for me with a bit of cleaning up
[14:34:22] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Kk6zg/
[14:35:03] <decx> the posting part at least ;)
[14:35:08] <duch_kazatel> and leaving in that comma.
[14:36:22] <MarGul> decx: It do not work for me. When I did it, using the same code pretty much, in an empty project I got it to work. But when I put it in my register.php file it just doesnt want to work. Feels like I missed some syntax stuff somewhere.
[14:36:40] <MarGul> decx: I mean the link you posted didnt update or do anything when I type in the box
[14:37:03] <MarGul> guess it shouldnt, just saw that now hehe
[14:37:53] <decx> check the console, the post to the php with your username parameter is sent out, but obviously fails. i didnt check the output though
[14:38:51] <MarGul> When I open the console I do not know what to check for. My console is just white and when I type in the input box nothing happens still
[14:40:09] <MarGul> I know that the first load will work because if I do echo "Hello" in username_check.php instead it will print it out. But the keyup function doesnt seam to work
[14:44:03] <MarGul> Just got it to work, knew there was a syntax error hehe. I had declared my div as #username and not #username_box for result. Thanks for the help tho guys :)
[14:44:29] <stack_> how can I set a val for a group of elements with same id?
[14:44:38] <duch_kazatel> stack_ you don't.
[14:44:46] <duch_kazatel> stack_ ids can only be used once per page.
[14:45:11] <stack_> got it
[14:45:12] <stack_> thx
[14:45:14] <duch_kazatel> use a class instead.
[14:57:58] <lukey> Stupid question, but why would upgrading from jq/m 1.6.4/1.0 to 1.11.0/1.4 have killed all my theming? i.e. data-theme seems to have no effect any more, everything is bright white whatever :\
[14:58:31] <duch_kazatel> because there were some HUGE changes between the two versions
[14:59:05] <lukey> duch_kazatel: I suspected as much
[14:59:58] <lukey> My app is really simple, just uses header/navbar/collapsible set/footer and that's about it
[15:00:09] <duch_kazatel> there's a migrate tool.
[15:01:50] <lukey> ah gotcha https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate
[15:02:02] <stack_> duch_kazatel: thx :d
[15:02:18] <lukey> duch_kazatel: yes Thank you!!
[15:04:17] <duch_kazatel> 'swhat i do.
[15:04:19] <lukey> duch_kazatel: it worked! so simple, how blind I was.
[15:04:47] <duch_kazatel> lukey that's a tool though - make sure you update your code.
[15:05:26] <lukey> duch_kazatel: already I still see bits that aren't quite right
[15:05:49] <duch_kazatel> use that with your console and documentation to fix stuff up.  1.8 or 1.9 was a HUGE release (can't remember which at the moment)
[15:06:56] <lukey> duch_kazatel: you mean the js console in chrome? this is all a bit new to me...
[15:07:03] <duch_kazatel> yes.  the console in chrome.
[15:07:16] <duch_kazatel> learning to use that will take you to new heights
[15:23:09] <nhulea_nsa> so I have this demo here and I wanted to load several images from the ajax call is there a way to load more than one into the browser so they are already loaded when I call it ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/mnfKn/
[15:23:16] <nhulea_nsa> just click the image
[15:23:23] <nhulea_nsa> it will load another one
[15:23:46] <nhulea_nsa> i am just trying load like 3 images ahead
[15:37:37] <nhulea_nsa> is there a way in jquery to skip and go to the next item in an array if a condition is met ?
[15:39:59] <duch_kazatel> wrap the contents of your iterator logic in an if check?
[15:41:18] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel:       if (img.source !== undefined) {} I got this but how do skip the item once the condition is met ?
[15:41:37] <duch_kazatel> if jquery
[15:41:37] <duch_kazatel> [2014:02:20:15:40:11] * CrazyZurfer (~crazyzurf@pc-157-230-47-190.cm.vtr.net) Q
[15:41:40] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[15:41:51] <duch_kazatel> if (!img.source !== undefined){}
[15:41:55] <duch_kazatel> blammo.
[15:42:07] <duch_kazatel> are you skipping when undefined?
[15:42:17] <nhulea_nsa> yeah thats what I want to do
[15:42:46] <MarGul> how do you send two values to a php file? Here is the code http://pastebin.com/R6feSgdZ , I want to send both the two post values : password, password_again. . When I echo $_POST['password_again'] . " " . $_POST['password'] on password_again_check.php I only get the $_POST['password_again']
[15:43:49] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa http://jsfiddle.net/HDtjY/
[15:44:44] <nhulea_nsa> ok cool I will give it a try !
[15:51:28] <duch_kazatel> aaah i hate code reviews.
[15:52:08] <iceptic> hey guys

[15:56:08] <iceptic> brief summery
[15:56:11] <iceptic> of problem
[15:56:39] <iceptic> posts 2 values but not 3, 3rd should be the data of the submit itself eg id of the submit button
[15:56:58] <duch_kazatel> iceptic first of all use the native success and error callbacks.
[15:57:09] <duch_kazatel> unless your error is being returned as a 200.
[15:59:18] <iceptic> error is being returned 200
[15:59:24] <duch_kazatel> that's... bad.  but OK.
[16:00:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd also bind to the form submit event instead of the button click.
[16:00:33] <iceptic> explain a little further dutch please
[16:00:41] <duch_kazatel> $(
[16:00:53] <duch_kazatel> $('form').on('submit', function(){};
[16:01:22] <duch_kazatel> instead of $(".submitBtn").click(function(e){
[16:02:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to modify a few things since $(this) no longer points to the button.
[16:03:17] <duch_kazatel> also, do var formData = $('#moneysubmit').serialize() + '&' + type + '=true';
[16:03:25] <duch_kazatel> instead of those two separate lines
[16:03:55] <duch_kazatel> also, formData is not a "data array".
[16:03:57] <duch_kazatel> it's just a string.
[16:04:21] <duch_kazatel> none of these will formally fix your problem, but it'll make thins a little cleaner/
[16:04:45] <iceptic> thanks tips taken on board cleaned up a little
[16:05:23] <iceptic> i think my issue lies here formData += "&"+type+"=true"
[16:05:29] <iceptic> but im not a 100%
[16:05:34] <duch_kazatel> again, do var formData = $('#moneysubmit').serialize() + '&' + type + '=true';
[16:05:42] <duch_kazatel> instead of the two separate lines.
[16:05:44] <duch_kazatel> is type a string?
[16:05:57] <iceptic> it should be going to an array
[16:06:05] <duch_kazatel> that is not an array.
[16:06:10] <duch_kazatel> you are confused about javascript.
[16:06:16] <iceptic> but serialse strings it belive?
[16:06:21] <duch_kazatel> .serialize() converts the form to a string.
[16:06:29] <iceptic> ah fuck
[16:06:45] <duch_kazatel> .serializeArray() does an array, but for what you want, that's not right.
[16:06:50] <duch_kazatel> you're handling your string correctly.
[16:07:38] <iceptic> so you think the form should submit correctly?
[16:07:42] <EminenceHC> Does anyone know what may be causing this error? https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/issues/535
[16:07:53] <duch_kazatel> if you make the change i've told you twice, it should.
[16:08:20] <phelix> Could someone help me figure out why the click item is not working properly. http://pastie.org/8753655 the item inside the if is working but then when I click on that class element I want it to change the style. that part is not changing.
[16:08:21] <iceptic> amount:100
[16:08:21] <iceptic> type:money
[16:08:39] <iceptic> thanks and it sitll only posts these to values
[16:09:08] <iceptic> im needing it to post the 3rd
[16:09:11] <duch_kazatel> do a console.log(formData) right before the $.ajax()
[16:09:17] <duch_kazatel> and tell me what that says.
[16:09:53] <duch_kazatel> iceptic oh don't do that...
[16:10:05] <duch_kazatel> $('fieldset.child-fieldset').css('display, 'block');
[16:10:13] <duch_kazatel> err - $('fieldset.child-fieldset').css('display', 'block');
[16:10:18] <Siecje> In the browser console I can do $('#table_id input') and it will contain all inputs in the table, but when I add a change() event it doesn't work for the datepicker I am using
[16:10:18] <Siecje> http://due-dates.herokuapp.com/7/course/8/  I would like the save button to show up after you select a date
[16:13:30] <phelix> duch_kazatel: It still isn't remove the display:none when i click on that above fieldset
[16:13:35] <LindsayMac> hey guys.. i'm having some issues with BBQ and pushState. I want to use BBQ for the deparam functions but I can't seem to work out how to get my url structure to look more like domain.com/myfilter instead of domain.com/filter=myfilter
[16:13:44] <LindsayMac> here is a link http://bscphoto.dev.creativesupplyco.net/portfolio-image
[16:13:44] <duch_kazatel> phelix make a jsfiddle
[16:14:04] <phelix> k let me try that.
[16:15:45] <iceptic> duch, im still confused as to why this isnt posting the submit id
[16:15:58] <duch_kazatel> iceptic did you tdo the console log I told you to do?
[16:16:10] <iceptic> ahh i thought u told me not to
[16:16:26] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/Tzv4m/
[16:16:35] <duch_kazatel> sorry i meant somebody else.
[16:17:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix wtf are you doing here?
[16:17:28] <decx> Siecje .datepicker has a changeDate event, so you can do $('#id_due_date').on('changeDate',function(){ show button })
[16:18:58] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: looks like I have a whole other issue now
[16:19:02] <nhulea_nsa> thanks though
[16:19:45] <LindsayMac> What's weird is it is triggering when i double click
[16:19:48] <phelix> duch_kazatel: just tried to grab the html I would need. When you click the top fieldset there is other js that removes the collapsed class
[16:20:02] <phelix> and the click should change the style on the fieldset at the bottom of the html
[16:20:10] <iceptic> syntax error on consol log
[16:20:18] <iceptic> so looking for my error lol
[16:20:29] <duch_kazatel> iceptic did you copy/paste what i gave you?
[16:20:40] <Siecje> decx: it is the one in the top form which could have different id
[16:20:42] <duch_kazatel> phelix $('fieldset.child-fieldset').css('display', 'none'); - you cannot click on this after you do this.
[16:20:49] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't exist any more.
[16:20:58] <phelix> no trying to click on the top field set
[16:20:58] <duch_kazatel> pretend that display:none; = "delete"
[16:21:09] <duch_kazatel> ok, 1 sec.
[16:21:48] <iceptic> i missed a bracket duch re-testing
[16:21:49] <duch_kazatel> waot ypiu
[16:21:58] <duch_kazatel> *wait phelix that click event isn't even working.
[16:22:02] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to do it on the click?
[16:22:07] <duch_kazatel> *click of that anchor
[16:22:09] <phelix> ya
[16:22:16] <phelix> the if part is working its the click even that isn't

[16:25:13] <phelix> k i see what you did. i didn't have it on the a tag duh

[16:28:16] <iceptic> the first 2 errors are fine
[16:28:19] <duch_kazatel> iceptic ... there are your problems.  your JS is hosed.
[16:28:37] <iceptic> its just stylesheets and my general bootstrap alert js script
[16:28:40] <MarkyC> iceptic: you're not including bootstrap. Make sure those files exist
[16:28:50] <duch_kazatel> when it says "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined", that means your jquery won't work.
[16:28:57] <duch_kazatel> remove the bootstrap stuff.
[16:29:00] <MarkyC> iceptic: $ is not defined because you haven't included jquery
[16:29:22] <iceptic> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>

[16:29:48] <duch_kazatel> fix the other issues first.
[16:31:30] <duch_kazatel> "guys i have errors on my site, but my javascript doesn't work. totally unrelated."
[16:31:32] <duch_kazatel> in this case...

[16:31:59] <duch_kazatel> iceptic
[16:33:01] <iceptic> that code didnt really need to run tho
[16:33:01] <iceptic> as it was just stlying and a js pop-up with formating for alerts
[16:33:01] <iceptic> ive fixed the issue still getting the same error
[16:33:11] <duch_kazatel> that $ isn't defined?
[16:33:16] <iceptic> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined crew.php:23
[16:33:16] <iceptic> (anonymous function) crew.php:23
[16:33:26] <duch_kazatel> that's literally causing everything else to break.
[16:35:07] <duch_kazatel> try replacing your doc ready with just $(function() {
[16:36:18] <MarkyC> iceptic: I think it would be best if you could post the page you are working on. We know for sure you have not included bootstrap, and it appears that jQuery might not be included first on your page

[16:36:38] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: my bad, link? I just joined to get some help :/
[16:37:12] <duch_kazatel> iceptic why do you have two closing script tags?
[16:37:16] <duch_kazatel> remove one of the two.
[16:38:28] <iceptic> removed and $(function() { done now getting error  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[16:38:41] <duch_kazatel> remove the extra closing script tag please.
[16:39:05] <iceptic> i have removed
[16:39:12] <duch_kazatel> same error?
[16:39:22] <iceptic> yeah :(
[16:39:42] <duch_kazatel> and your HTML is valid?
[16:39:48] <duch_kazatel> are you getting any other errors?
[16:40:01] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: can't be, he's got a <table> in the <head> tag
[16:40:12] <duch_kazatel> no he doesn't.
[16:40:13] <Siecje> I know that you can use startswith but what if you want to match id_assignments-0-due_date and id_assignments-1-due_date with the number changing
[16:40:29] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: sorry, before the <html> tag
[16:40:30] <duch_kazatel> that's in his php, which i don't know about.
[16:40:40] <duch_kazatel> that PHP and shouldn't be getting shot out.
[16:40:57] <duch_kazatel> Siecje are you wanting to match all strings tha are id_assignments-0-due_date, but the number changes?
[16:41:05] <jwmann> duch_kazatel ssssssaaaaave meeeeee
[16:41:27] <duch_kazatel> hah, doing my best here :)
[16:41:29] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: I pretty you were the one who helped me a couple days back too.. xD
[16:42:03] <iceptic> im going to remove the php just incase its causing a probem
[16:42:09] <Siecje> duch_kazatel: correct
[16:42:18] <duch_kazatel> Siecje use a regular expression.
[16:43:32] <iceptic> still same error with the php removed
[16:44:28] <duch_kazatel> Siecje#jquery
[16:44:28] <duch_kazatel> [2014:02:20:16:42:09] <Siecje> duch_kazatel: correct
[16:44:35] <duch_kazatel> wtf jsfiddle.net/6hf2r/
[16:44:53] <duch_kazatel> iceptic are you getting any other console errors?
[16:45:16] <iceptic> nope just that 1 error
[16:45:57] <duch_kazatel> try replacing that line with jQuery(function($) {
[16:46:07] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, you've got huge problems.
[16:46:09] <iceptic>    var formData = $('#moneysubmit').serialize() formData += "&"+type+"=true";
[16:46:09] <iceptic> doesnt seem to like this line
[16:46:24] <duch_kazatel> iceptic none of your code is running.
[16:46:39] <iceptic> true
[16:46:42] <duch_kazatel> if it's bombing on that first line, it's bombing on all of them.
[16:47:49] <iceptic> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier crew.php:29
[16:47:49] <iceptic> same error :(
[16:48:18] <duch_kazatel> have you tried putting your code into a separate file and calling it from there?
[16:49:02] <iceptic> sorry i lie i pasted the wrong error code
[16:49:02] <iceptic> Uncaught ReferenceError: jquery is not defined
[16:49:14] <duch_kazatel> right, you have a fundamental problem.
[16:49:19] <iceptic> and ive not tried running via another script as of yet
[16:49:20] <duch_kazatel> wait...
[16:49:26] <duch_kazatel> did you do jQuery, or jquery
[16:49:35] <duch_kazatel> ie - did you copy EXACTLY what I gave you?
[16:49:57] <iceptic> tried both
[16:49:57] <iceptic> same error
[16:50:14] <duch_kazatel> then do another file and reference it after the jquery one.  if that doesn't work...
[16:52:30] <iceptic> still same error jquery not defined
[16:53:05] <LindsayMac> iceptic:  are you in conflict mode?
[16:53:18] <iceptic> conflict mode?
[16:53:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah at this point you've got a central problem.
[16:53:30] <duch_kazatel> dude you don't have a doctype.
[16:53:33] <LindsayMac> either you are using $, jQuery, or jquery
[16:53:54] <duch_kazatel> <!DOCTYPE html>
[16:54:02] <duch_kazatel> but that before <html>
[16:54:14] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac we all ready tried to address that.
[16:55:34] <iceptic> still the same when doctype forced
[16:55:51] <LindsayMac> sorry
[16:55:51] <duch_kazatel> iceptic then you have a central problem.  that include isn't getting included somewhere.
[16:56:00] <LindsayMac> WOAH!
[16:56:00] <duch_kazatel> *somehow
[16:56:03] <duch_kazatel> netsplit
[16:57:32] <iceptic> god dammit stupid code work! (slaps it a few times)
[16:58:21] <duch_kazatel> iceptic try to load http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js in a browser window.
[16:58:52] <iceptic> just shows all the js?
[16:59:03] <duch_kazatel> then something here is way fucked up.
[16:59:17] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?
[16:59:22] <iceptic> chrome
[17:00:03] <iceptic> ive tried in ff and ie
[17:00:03] <iceptic> same :(
[17:00:04] <duch_kazatel> are you getting anything about "failed to load resource"
[17:00:11] <iceptic> nope
[17:00:57] <MarkyC> iceptic: after you include jquery, could you please paste this: <script>$(function() { console.log( "The page loaded fine!" ); });</script>
[17:01:02] <duch_kazatel> try replacing your current jquery copy with  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:01:45] <MarkyC> iceptic: if you get a console message saying the page loaded, then jquery (and the $ ) should work.
[17:03:04] <LindsayMac> ok THIS is making no sense.. the url us updating with the value that I want it to, but strangely the filter is only triggering if i double click on one of the links http://bscphoto.dev.creativesupplyco.net/portfolio-image (click any of the yellow links.. double click to see the filter happen with 'show all' or 'weddings + engagements'
[17:04:17] <LindsayMac> double clicking also seems to add the path i want to AVOID having to use
[17:06:59] <LindsayMac> I was thinking i could store the object in the stateObj instead of leaving it in the url like filter=.myfilter
[17:07:14] <LindsayMac> but no matter what i do, the event.state is empty
[17:07:15] <duch_kazatel> what are you using that bbq plugin for?
[17:08:04] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  to deparam
[17:08:19] <duch_kazatel> that's all? so you can insert something into the url a special way?
[17:08:20] <LindsayMac> but I am open to not using it. I am honestly not that strong with jquery
[17:08:24] <LindsayMac> i am a backend person
[17:08:29] <iceptic> Uncaught ReferenceError: jquery is not defined still same error :(
[17:08:39] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: right now I am using 		history.pushState( datafilter, '', str);
[17:08:41] <MarkyC> iceptic: after you include jquery, could you please paste this: <script>$(function() { console.log( "The page loaded fine!" ); });</script>
[17:08:44] <MarkyC> iceptic: if you get a console message saying the page loaded, then jquery (and the $ ) should work.
[17:08:45] <iceptic> with gogle
[17:08:45] <iceptic> but consol log doesnt show anything about load success
[17:08:59] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i've been trying to work out a way to NOT have to use it
[17:09:01] <LindsayMac> to be honest
[17:09:23] <iceptic> marky i didnt get the page loaded fine in consol log
[17:09:36] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac so you just want to enter something at the end of the URL?  because that's easy - history.pushState().
[17:09:38] <LindsayMac> iceptic:  do you have this page publicly viewable?
[17:09:42] <MarkyC> iceptic: so the problem lies with the way you've imported jquery
[17:10:05] <iceptic> its not publically viewable
[17:10:06] <iceptic> but i can give login details
[17:10:07] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  well, I already am adding soemthing at the end of the url.. but I cant seem to get that to happen WITH the isotope filtering after
[17:10:28] <LindsayMac> AND to make it something that obcviously also uses the forward/back buttons and direct linking
[17:10:30] <iceptic> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:10:36] <LindsayMac> (the main reasons anyone wants to use these kinds of things)
[17:10:50] <LindsayMac> iceptic:  why not just release that password protection for a moment so people can stop guessing and just look ?
[17:10:52] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i have no idea how your whole setup is working, but pushstates are easy to maintain.  i've done it a few times before.
[17:10:53] <MarkyC> iceptic: does this page give you a popup saying the page loaded fine? http://jsfiddle.net/99GPj/
[17:11:12] <MarkyC> if so, please paste your /complete/ code in a pastebin
[17:11:41] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  if you have a look.. it's RELATIVELY basic.. I have href="filter=.my-category'
[17:12:09] <LindsayMac> i am using a regex to get the important data from there and using BBQ deparam to turn that into Filter: "my-category'
[17:12:18] <iceptic> it sure does, and the login part is needed for the certain functions to post etc
[17:12:18] <iceptic> but i could just remove it to test the jquery/ajax
[17:12:23] <LindsayMac> then history.pushState() to update the path
[17:12:54] <LindsayMac> I THOUGHT that if I did .bind('hashchange' .. i would be able to re-access the stateObject to use that info to finish the filtering
[17:12:58] <LindsayMac> but that seems to not work.
[17:13:08] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac not on hashchange.
[17:13:19] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i've also tried it on popstate
[17:13:21] <LindsayMac> which ?
[17:13:36] <duch_kazatel> popstate will work.
[17:13:37] <LindsayMac> the isotope demo has the url domain.com/filter=.my-cat and Id on't like that
[17:13:49] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  doesn't popstate only fire when you use forward and backward buttons?
[17:13:55] <LindsayMac> because right now, thats what it seems like
[17:14:00] <duch_kazatel> and when you replaceState()
[17:14:02] <LindsayMac> popstate isn't firing when I click the links
[17:14:12] <LindsayMac> I am not running replacestate() .. when should I do that?
[17:14:16] <duch_kazatel> wait no only on forward or back.
[17:14:21] <duch_kazatel> hashchange only works with #
[17:14:38] <LindsayMac> ahh hashchange requires # .. is there a way to get around using # ?
[17:14:50] <LindsayMac> i wat a nice clean url domain.com/page/my-filter
[17:15:26] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:15:40] <LindsayMac> So you're saying i NEED to have # in my url?
[17:15:48] <duch_kazatel> only if you want to use hashchange.
[17:16:02] <LindsayMac> well i dont NEED to use it.. i am trying to figur eout alternatives
[17:16:07] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you need to have logic that manages everything from page update to doing the history.pushState()
[17:16:08] <iceptic> when removing the login checks etc im not getting page loaded fine!
[17:16:08] <iceptic> but functions done work
[17:16:11] <iceptic> http://emafia.co.uk/xtreme/crew/crew.php
[17:16:15] <LindsayMac> I am still figuring all this out, I dont have any 'I MUST USE THIS" pretexts
[17:16:32] <LindsayMac> what do you mean "page update"
[17:17:24] <duch_kazatel> the way I handled something similar to what you're doing is I proxied all my "page update" code through a function - it dispatched the history.pushState() and all the logic I was using for my ajax (in my case)
[17:17:27] <duch_kazatel> it basically handled everything.
[17:17:53] <duch_kazatel> I explicitly called that instead of relying on, say, hash changes.
[17:18:09] <LindsayMac> and again, by "page update" you mean..?
[17:18:14] <LindsayMac> you hooked to any page change event?
[17:18:21] <duch_kazatel> anything I did, yeah
[17:19:00] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  curious.. what was your purpose for avoiding the use of the hash  in the url path?
[17:19:06] <MarkyC> iceptic: In that page, jquery does in fact work
[17:19:24] <iceptic> once i have removed the login check function
[17:19:45] <MarkyC> iceptic: which suggests that your problem lies in the login check function
[17:19:48] <iceptic> when i move the login check function it breaks again as to why i am not sure :(
[17:19:57] <MarkyC> iceptic: you're using php?
[17:20:03] <iceptic> yeah
[17:20:17] <iceptic> it works perfect on every other page with jquery
[17:20:17] <iceptic> but not this :S
[17:20:32] <MarkyC> -> /join ##php I'll be there. Post your php code
[17:21:09] <MarkyC> Anyways, back to my problem: I have a form with a submit and delete button. When the delete button is pressed, I change the form action, and submit(). Unfortunately, the form doesn't actually submit, but the action is indeed changed. If I hit the form's submit button, it will actually submit. Could someone shed some light on what's going on here?  code : http://pastebin.com/1Q8gtn0D
[17:21:18] <duch_kazatel> because it was ugly.
[17:21:26] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ok ya. my same reason
[17:21:27] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:23:23] <furry_monkey> Hi guys, can someone help me out. http://www.liquidlizard.net/jobs/search <-- on this page I have an input where ppl can enter a location and when they hit enter or click the submit button I run a function to geocode the location they've typed in, updade some hidden lat lng inputs and only then submit the form. Trouble is, although it works fine when youclick the button, for some reason when you hit return (although the same code ha
[17:23:23] <furry_monkey> ppens) it must not be updating the lat lng inputs because when the page reloads the original location instead of the new location in on the map
[17:23:36] <furry_monkey> the codes at http://pastebin.com/8SuVjqY5
[17:24:16] <furry_monkey> like I say, although it uses the same code, for some reason when you click the button everything works fine, but hit enter to do the submitting and you get a different result
[17:24:22] <furry_monkey> anyone any ideas?
[17:26:42] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i think your input needs to be wrapped in <form>
[17:27:01] <LindsayMac> or actually, your whole form should be
[17:27:42] <LindsayMac> oops furry_monkey ^
[17:27:44] <LindsayMac> not duch_kazatel
[17:29:35] <furry_monkey> lindsaymac - they are wrapped in <form>?
[17:30:32] <LindsayMac> furry_monkey:  your <form> seems to terminate before your second column
[17:30:54] <LindsayMac> http://cl.ly/image/0v1K3N440114
[17:32:22] <furry_monkey> lindsaymac - if you view source it looks ok? what's that a screenshot of?
[17:32:38] <LindsayMac> furry_monkey:  that is the source
[17:32:43] <MarkyC> I found the answer to my problem, but I don't know WHY it works. If I use $('#edit').find('form').attr(...).submit() it works, but $('#myForm').attr(...).submit() doesn't. Can someone shed some light here?
[17:33:00] <jotterbot1234> hey guys, http://pastebin.com/QvbrecHb, line 25 is this even possible?
[17:33:04] <LindsayMac> furry_monkey:  you can see that the <form> is wrapping only the first and its closed before your zip inoput
[17:35:50] <LindsayMac> the more I look at this JS the more confused I get
[17:36:05] <jotterbot1234> mine?
[17:36:13] <LindsayMac> no mine
[17:36:21] <jotterbot1234> aaah i see
[17:36:51] <furry_monkey> lindsaymac http://liquidlizard.net/img/source.png this is what I see, the form starts at the top and finishes at the bottom. all the inputs in between
[17:37:53] <jotterbot1234> sorry i've updated my pastebin, I need help trying to get a file attachment, like the .val() if that is even possible?
[17:38:03] <jotterbot1234> http://pastebin.com/SktvuTuA
[17:40:34] <LindsayMac> furry_monkey:  dont know what to tell you ... when you view it in the web inspector in chrome it appears to be prematurely closing
[17:41:06] <LindsayMac> furry_monkey:  http://cl.ly/image/3L1D1N3h1K18
[17:41:09] <LindsayMac> more proof
[17:44:31] <furry_monkey> LindsayMac - thanks for pointing it out. I think I've fixed that now, but it hasn't solved my problem unfortunately
[17:50:08] <LindsayMac> I have NO IDEA why.. but clicking the same link for the second time triggers the hashchange event but the first time it doesnt.. wtf
[17:50:42] <tds5016> can someone point me in the direction of a library or plugin that would decode an x509 certificate?
[17:51:16] <tds5016> jsrsasign looks like it works; but it only works for version 3, or so it appears.
[17:52:38] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: val() should return the filename
[17:52:46] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: do you want the file itself?
[18:00:06] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: yes please
[18:00:27] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: So you want to use jquery to upload files. There are libraries for that
[18:00:29] <jotterbot1234> i need the actual file so i can add it to google drive
[18:00:44] <jotterbot1234> i'm being cheeky and using htmlservice in googleapps script
[18:00:59] <jotterbot1234> but my understanding is i am using jquery 1.10.2
[18:01:18] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: use a library, you don't want to reinvent the wheel here.
[18:01:45] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: I am sure there is an easier way to do it
[18:02:28] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: I am just lacking the correct terminology to explain what i want to do
[18:02:45] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: You want to upload a file and send it to Google Drive, correct?
[18:04:03] <jotterbot1234> yes absolutely, but if you have seen my pastebin, i am using formResponse in my function, so i am trying to just "tack on" the file
[18:04:22] <jotterbot1234> unless there is some way to access the file upload in the form directly referencing it some other way
[18:06:51] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: Are you aware that files in a form are uploaded /after/ the submit button is pressed?
[18:07:35] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: yes, is my code running on not that assumption?
[18:08:05] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: You want to change the way form's are handled by uploading the file /before/ the submit button is pressed
[18:08:24] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: in fact, in my execution transcript it had said something like "setContentTypeFromExtension() of null"
[18:08:40] <jotterbot1234> cant**
[18:10:28] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: Is the form's action the script that handles inserting the file into Google Drive? or is it a backend function that processes the form data?
[18:11:30] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: sorry, i am trying but am a novice so can't explain myself so well.
[18:11:44] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: a user fills in a form entirely, and has an attachemnt button
[18:11:52] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: you have a <form>, what is in action="???????"
[18:12:18] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: there is no action?
[18:12:24] <jotterbot1234> but they click a button
[18:12:30] <jotterbot1234> <input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit Form" onclick="getValuesAndGo(); return false;">
[18:12:38] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: okay, I get it now
[18:12:49] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: sorry :S
[18:13:32] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: so google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(progress).formSubmitter(formResponse); fails? possibly because there is no file uploaded?
[18:13:53] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: that is my belief, yes
[18:14:03] <jotterbot1234> if it was a textbox or radio button, etc
[18:14:06] <jotterbot1234> it works fine
[18:14:35] <MarkyC> jotterbot1234: So clearly we need to upload the file, then run that google code, right?
[18:15:50] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: seemingly so? (I am pastebin-ing a sanatized version of html/code) one sec
[18:16:01] <jotterbot1234> I think that will become clear to those in the know :)
[18:16:14] <MarkyC> (It sounds sarcastic my bad, but I really don't know anything about the google library you're using here)
[18:17:18] <jotterbot1234> it's really great right up until it's not! haha
[18:17:25] <MarkyC> If the file needs to be uploaded and then sent to Google, you'll have to use a plugin/library to get file uploading functionality in jQuery
[18:17:32] <taro-k> Hi, could you tell me where I can check sha512sum of your tar.gz?

[18:21:52] <simpleuser> Hi there. I'm completely new in js and jquery. I found this code to change the value of a select input : https://dpaste.de/tJx6 My question is: How to do the same but with a variable ? Something like this: https://dpaste.de/08uL
[18:21:56] <simpleuser> Is it possible ?
[18:22:04] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: this is the html i am working with http://pastebin.com/Srn6fTVT
[18:22:48] <jotterbot1234> MarkyC: probably from line 139 is the bit i am botching up
[18:23:50] <MarkyC> and what google js plugin are you using?
[18:32:45] <jotterbot1234> sorry have been pulled away

[20:08:14] <Linkandzelda> hey guys, what would be the easiest way to make a visual path based FAQ that shows the right answer based on question conditions? maybe this isnt the best channel but I have a feeling jquery would be needed
[20:08:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[20:09:07] <Linkandzelda> I guess the best way I could describe it is a FAQ flow chart
[20:09:31] <duch_kazatel> protip: nobody can read your mind :)
[20:09:39] <duch_kazatel> so some kind of example would be helpful.
[20:11:50] <Linkandzelda> ok, an example is this: page shows a list of basic questions like an FAQ page. user selects the question that is relevant to them, it then asks them a series of different questions which, after they choose the answers, will lead them to the correct and helpful answer
[20:12:20] <duch_kazatel> if you don't want the page to reload at all, javascript would be used.  you could use jquery to simplify that.
[20:12:45] <Linkandzelda> yes no reloading, I was thinking of simply appending to the page with the required data
[20:12:59] <Linkandzelda> returned data*
[20:13:23] <duch_kazatel> depending on the amount of data, i'd just have it all on page, ready to go.
[20:13:49] <Linkandzelda> ah
[20:13:55] <Linkandzelda> and hidden?
[20:14:24] <duch_kazatel> sure.  or you could have a big ol' JSON object and use that.
[20:14:44] <BillCriswell> I'm having so much more luck with gulp than grunt.
[20:14:45] <Linkandzelda> ah, thats quite cool
[20:15:09] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh?
[20:15:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yesh.
[20:15:54] <duch_kazatel> ooh, interesting.
[20:16:23] <duch_kazatel> not bad.
[20:16:47] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I dig it so far!
[20:17:18] <pom_life> BillCriswell, my man. What's happening, dog?
[20:17:26] <BillCriswell> Not a lot. Yourself?
[20:17:33] <pom_life> Just signed up for college today 8)
[20:17:44] <duch_kazatel> nice, pom_life
[20:17:58] <pom_life> I got inspired and decided to commit to the next step.
[20:18:10] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Sounds good!
[20:18:17] <pom_life> I mean shit, it can't be that much different from what I'm doing everyday anyway, just a bit more structured.
[20:18:19] <duch_kazatel> brb
[20:18:19] <BillCriswell> What for?
[20:18:36] <pom_life> generic CS right now, though I'll probably specialize eventually
[20:19:19] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[20:19:43] <duch_kazatel> all right there we go
[20:19:47] <pom_life> I'm almost 22, so I figured it's either start now or regret not starting later :]
[20:20:18] <CrazyZurfer> how can I make an horizontal list and the ones that don't fit in the screen width, put them in a dropdown?
[20:20:50] <BillCriswell> pom_life: I hear that. I kind of just went to visit friends at college and drink. I think that was the right choice for me.
[20:21:05] <duch_kazatel> I did basically the same, BillCriswell
[20:21:23] <pom_life> I feel like that path won't be as accessible in the future.
[20:21:28] <pom_life> At least, reliably
[20:21:33] <duch_kazatel> what, college?
[20:21:54] <BillCriswell> Parts of me wanted to go to college, but thinking about the debt afterwards was brutal. I kind of want to do a few math classes at some point.
[20:21:59] <pom_life> No, I mean "happening into" a software development position through experience
[20:22:21] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[20:22:45] <pom_life> I mean, back when you were just getting into it it was an empty frontier waiting to be claimed. Nowadays it's a lot more structured, you know?
[20:23:01] <duch_kazatel> pom_life not for me.
[20:23:02] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[20:23:45] <BillCriswell> I don't think it's more structured now... I feel like it was easier to find a job? I think I just got real lucky with my first job haha
[20:24:08] <pom_life> Well, back in 1999 knowing HTML alone was enough to find SOME FORM of employment
[20:24:36] <duch_kazatel> pom_life I didn't get my first official dev title until, what, like 2 years ago?
[20:24:46] <pom_life> Aren't you late 20s?
[20:24:51] <duch_kazatel> 26 yeah.
[20:25:05] <pom_life> Don't get me wrong, I could still go the conventional path
[20:25:11] <duch_kazatel> i was doing frontend work before then, but under a different title.
[20:25:11] <pom_life> what I'd do is work long hours on a portfolio
[20:25:15] <pom_life> and thgen advertise locally
[20:25:25] <pom_life> and then jump from company to company hopefully
[20:25:34] <pom_life> but it's not "reliable"
[20:25:36] <tw2113> find yourself a remote company
[20:25:37] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do i.
[20:25:47] <pom_life> alternatively I could work my ass off at school, get some form of internship and go that route
[20:25:55] <pom_life> while meeting connections
[20:26:11] <tw2113> school is great for general fundamentals and networking
[20:26:26] <pom_life> yeah, which i need desperately. I'm from small-town Texas.
[20:26:26] <duch_kazatel> i started working at a place when i was 18, stayed there for 7 years, got moved to development, then got a great offer at a company i really wanted to be at.
[20:26:33] <tw2113> most schools get you enough for entry level foot in the door
[20:26:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the current standard is 5 years experience or a degree.
[20:26:56] <duch_kazatel> from what i've seen lately.
[20:27:12] <CrazyZurfer> how can I make an horizontal list and the ones that don't fit in the screen width, put them in a dropdown?
[20:27:47] <duch_kazatel> CrazyZurfer use float: left; on the LIs and then manually calculate what's actually diplaying.
[20:28:04] <duch_kazatel> and put the ones that "don't fit" into a dropdown.
[20:28:39] <CrazyZurfer> duch_kazatel: the idea of it is make it work for all screen sizes
[20:28:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Did you do more front or back end stuff?
[20:29:03] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I handled the whitelabeling markup for over 400 sites.
[20:29:16] <duch_kazatel> CrazyZurfer what I said still applies :)
[20:29:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell so i was mostly frontend.  still am.  i have backend experience now.
[20:30:12] <tw2113> i'm 100% wordpress *ducks*
[20:30:22] <duch_kazatel> pfff php.
[20:30:30] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what are you?
[20:30:59] <BillCriswell> I really have no idea haha
[20:31:03] <duch_kazatel> hah
[20:31:19] <BillCriswell> I've done both.. consider myself more front-end I think though.
[20:31:37] <duch_kazatel> fair enough. what backend languages/platforms you familiar with?
[20:31:45] <BillCriswell> Graduated in 2003, started working like a week after.
[20:32:03] <BillCriswell> Mostly PHP, CodeIgniter apps and things like that.
[20:32:24] <BillCriswell> Been playing around with express lately. I like Javascript enough to use it on the server I think.
[20:33:49] <BillCriswell> Played around with CakePHP for a while.. that didn't go well.
[20:34:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Been spending a lot of time trying to get better with my tools lately though.
[20:34:33] <duch_kazatel> experimenting with different things?
[20:34:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah.. I spend a lot of time doing that. Never really building anything though sadly.
[20:35:32] <duch_kazatel> it's a good thing to know.  that's one area I'm kind of ignorant.
[20:36:35] <BillCriswell> It gets really distracting sometimes.
[20:36:55] <BillCriswell> Running around to the next thing. Kind of fun, kind of sucks.
[20:37:05] <duch_kazatel> also: sierra nevada's single hop harvest ipa is awesome.
[20:37:38] <BillCriswell> Haven't tried that yet.
[20:37:59] <duch_kazatel> so good
[20:42:06] <BillCriswell> I'm rewatching Ja'mie.
[20:43:34] <duch_kazatel> nice
[20:44:14] <BillCriswell> Ever watch it? So... strange.
[20:45:05] <duch_kazatel> no.  it looks weird though.
[20:46:02] <BillCriswell> It's every bit as weird as you'd imagine.
[20:46:09] <BillCriswell> Hilarious though.
[20:46:23] <duch_kazatel> i'll belive it.
[20:49:36] <naeluhNSA> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/mnfKn/4/ hey can someone click these images and then kinda tell me why if you check in the console that sometimes it comes up as undefined I am not sure what the problem is
[20:50:05] <duch_kazatel> naeluhNSA put your script in the script panel.
[20:50:19] <naeluhNSA> early I was trying to understand this problem and I was never able to solve it
[20:50:34] <duch_kazatel> wait paperscript?  wut
[20:50:36] <naeluhNSA> its a paperscript setup
[20:50:43] <naeluhNSA> paperjs
[20:50:58] <naeluhNSA> regular js works in  there
[20:51:15] <naeluhNSA> and jquet
[20:51:19] <naeluhNSA> jquery
[20:51:40] <BillCriswell> Never even heard of that.
[20:51:56] <duch_kazatel> what is paperscript?
[20:52:11] <naeluhNSA> paper.js
[20:52:17] <naeluhNSA> paperjs.org
[20:52:24] <naeluhNSA> its canvas vector stuff
[20:53:09] <naeluhNSA> I am just wondering why it would return an undefined you see that ?
[20:53:34] <naeluhNSA> might be more my ajax call and then how I am dealing with it
[20:54:15] <Vivekananda> I am writing hover and jquery fucntions but want the thing to work both on phones, ipads and laptops do I choose different libraries of jquery ?
[20:54:18] <duch_kazatel> maybe?  console log in your ajax call and see what comes back.
[20:54:21] <Vivekananda> I have another problem
[20:54:29] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda there is no such thing as "hover"
[20:54:33] <duch_kazatel> on mobile
[20:54:43] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I got that working :). now I have to finetune stuff
[20:54:47] <naeluhNSA> the undefineds come completely out of no where but since its computers nothing is really random
[20:55:03] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: hmmm so what do I substitute :hover for ?
[20:55:10] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda a different design.
[20:55:18] <Vivekananda> or how do I encode so that I get a similar functionality
[20:55:59] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda uh.. you can't.
[20:57:56] <Vivekananda> well then can I do something instead ?
[20:58:02] <Vivekananda> like click maybe ?
[20:58:37] <duch_kazatel> naeluhNSA console.log your result in handledata - you'll see that the undefined results are different from the others.
[20:58:50] <BillCriswell> naeluhNSA: You're requesting like some weird number of random images on every click.
[20:59:13] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda it'd be "tap", and that doesn't make much sense on mobile - tap once to "expand", tap again to go somewhere?
[20:59:20] <naeluhNSA> BillCriswell: yeah I see that
[20:59:49] <naeluhNSA> duch_kazatel: ok I will check that
[21:01:13] <BillCriswell> naeluhNSA: What is your goal?
[21:01:18] <naeluhNSA> duch_kazatel: where are you running  console.log(result);
[21:01:34] <naeluhNSA> remove the undefined source BillCriswell
[21:01:38] <duch_kazatel> first thing in that function I mentioned.
[21:02:13] <BillCriswell> naeluhNSA: Do you mean to be loading that many images on every click?
[21:02:20] <naeluhNSA> no
[21:02:21] <BillCriswell> Well, that many image... objects.
[21:02:33] <naeluhNSA> no I am def am not
[21:02:37] <BillCriswell> naeluhNSA: Are you trying to keep a list and when it gets low grab some more?
[21:02:55] <naeluhNSA> yes I am
[21:03:12] <duch_kazatel> right now it fetches more when it hits an undefined one.
[21:04:34] <naeluhNSA> ok so I am going to remove that but I am still not sure how it comes up udefined I saw the array of 139 but I didnt see the difference between undefined and not
[21:05:09] <duch_kazatel> click through and count how many times it takes to get an undefined one.  when you hit it, find the corresponding entry in the array
[21:05:23] <naeluhNSA> ok
[21:05:26] <duch_kazatel> (it'll be the number you came up with minus one, because 0-based indexes)
[21:05:31] <duch_kazatel> i saw a different.
[21:05:35] <duch_kazatel> *difference
[21:05:38] <naeluhNSA> ok thanks
[21:07:13] <BillCriswell> You have a function rimgur and variable called rimgur as well, which I think is causing the reloading or whatever
[21:07:13] <pom_life> Why do the stats for "User" and "Enemy" end up being the same? > http://pastebin.com/9wkADSgh <
[21:08:06] <duch_kazatel> pom_life why are you using a switch in an enumerator?
[21:08:13] <duch_kazatel> *iterator
[21:08:35] <pom_life> you mean in a for loop?
[21:08:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah, an iterator
[21:09:00] <pom_life> i mean, i know multiple ways of doing this
[21:09:09] <pom_life> i was wondering why, in this specific example, they were the same
[21:09:42] <duch_kazatel> wonder if it has something to do with enemyStatSeed being in the same scope.
[21:09:59] <GoSox> is there a way i can do a page redirect, where it redirects to a new url, as a POST, not a GET? On a page with no forms?
[21:10:18] <duch_kazatel> GoSox huh?
[21:10:56] <duch_kazatel> GoSox no, you cannot redirect using a post.
[21:11:27] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: will click work on phones then ?
[21:11:34] <Vivekananda> I can do a click instead of a hover
[21:12:08] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda a click doesn't make sense depend on the UI.  i assume you have something expand and then they can click on it to see something?
[21:13:40] <jwmann> Can someone explain to me why I'm getting 'Unexpected token [' error from line 20 - http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/2/ ?
[21:14:03] <Vivekananda> yes
[21:14:13] <duch_kazatel> jwmann drop the var keyword
[21:14:26] <Vivekananda> that is correct duch_kazatel . how do I acheive this functionality in a way so it works bot on
[21:14:29] <jwmann> OMG
[21:14:32] <Vivekananda> both on desk an dlap
[21:14:38] <jwmann> I CAN'T BELEIVE THAT'S ALL IT WAS.
[21:14:41] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that won't work.
[21:14:47] <jwmann> *Facepalm*
[21:14:51] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that ui workflow doesn't make any sense.
[21:14:53] <duch_kazatel> jwmann :)
[21:14:53] <jwmann> Thanks duch_kazatel  -.-
[21:15:02] <duch_kazatel> even better: i've been drinkign
[21:15:08] <duch_kazatel> *drinking
[21:15:14] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: you mean a menu with folder sublevels does not make sense ???
[21:15:35] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda depends entirely on the UX.  multilevel menues can be a bad idea on mobile.
[21:15:48] <duch_kazatel> you really need a separate design for it to work.
[21:16:12] <Vivekananda> ummm so what are some of the events that I can utilize for menu in a mobile world ?
[21:16:21] <Vivekananda> no dropdowns
[21:16:25] <Vivekananda> no expanding stuff ?
[21:16:41] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda do you have a smartphone?
[21:17:23] <duch_kazatel> either way - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Touch_events
[21:17:34] <duch_kazatel> there's also hammer.js and other libs that make everything easier.
[21:18:56] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Could you tell me why my 'itemName' variable doesn't actually show in my JSON? It just shows "itemName" for every value - http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/3/
[21:19:21] <jwmann> Line 19
[21:20:26] <duch_kazatel> jwmann because that's the property name.  http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/4/
[21:20:29] <duch_kazatel> check that out.
[21:20:50] <duch_kazatel> use square brackets when you want to evaluate the statement and get the name.
[21:21:03] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you're just using whatever word you put
[21:22:03] <jwmann> errrr, it doesn't seem to output anything :X
[21:22:06] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: When using an existing function as a setInterval, you use >   var foo = setInterval(function, 1000);   <
[21:22:12] <pom_life> What if function has parameters?
[21:23:03] <duch_kazatel> pom_life you'll have to either define in the function itself, or do something like (function(){ yourFunction() });
[21:23:05] <duch_kazatel> iirc
[21:23:33] <hendry> is i want to shove response.id + response.foobar into a $.post('/delete.php', HERE, ... // How do I do it? JSON.stringify an created object?
[21:24:46] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: let's say  >   var increaseCount = function (number) {number++; return number;}  < ;        and I want to set >    var countIt = setInterval(increaseCount(someNumber), 1000)   <
[21:24:50] <pom_life> Why would that not work?
[21:25:04] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure what you did but it doesn't output anything anymore.. xD
[21:25:20] <jwmann> It looks like it should work :S
[21:25:26] <duch_kazatel> pom_life it all ready calls it as a function.
[21:25:33] <duch_kazatel> pom_life you're calling it as a function twice...
[21:25:49] <duch_kazatel> jwmann link again?
[21:25:52] <duch_kazatel> wait nvm
[21:25:53] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[21:26:00] <jwmann> http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/5/
[21:26:09] <pom_life> is a setInterval not just a function that runs a function every x amount of seconds?
[21:26:27] <jwmann> There was original a mistyped } bracket but switching back to a ] didn't fix it.
[21:26:28] <duch_kazatel> try this - jwmann http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/6/
[21:26:54] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Nope, same deal
[21:27:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/7/
[21:27:10] <duch_kazatel> this?
[21:27:44] <duch_kazatel> pom_life setInterval just takes a functions name, not the function call itself.
[21:27:47] <jwmann> Ah there we go
[21:28:13] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: right. so if the function needs a parameter to work, how can i possibly input one?
[21:29:14] <duch_kazatel> use an anonymous function - function(){yourFunc(yourArgs)}
[21:29:14] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Is there a way I can 'add' to the 'paymentsJSON[paymentCycle]' object? Right now it's just overwriting itself everytime?
[21:30:00] <duch_kazatel> jwmann hoist your var declarations ip.  your redeclaring everything.
[21:30:02] <duch_kazatel> *you're
[21:30:23] <jwmann> hoist?
[21:31:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/8/
[21:31:31] <duch_kazatel> even better... one sec.
[21:32:37] <jwmann> Well the probably is that I'm declaring the payment cycle as an empty object after every loop
[21:32:52] <duch_kazatel> yup
[21:32:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/9/
[21:32:54] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[21:33:15] <jwmann> Nope :(
[21:33:25] <jwmann> It's honestly Line 23
[21:34:06] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: do I redirect to different .js and .php pages based on what the environment is ?
[21:34:19] <Vivekananda> or do I just redirect to the regular
[21:34:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[21:34:35] <naeluhNSA> duch_kazatel: did you see is_album was the difference?
[21:35:13] <Vivekananda> I mean since you said hover and click are not good for a mobile phone then if my wepage is being opened in a mobile phpne do I use a different js file ?
[21:35:24] <duch_kazatel> jwmann http://jsfiddle.net/X4asj/10/ it'll look something like this.
[21:35:51] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: That's pretty much exactly what I ended up doing. xD
[21:35:54] <jwmann> Thanks :0
[21:35:56] <jwmann> :)
[21:36:10] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda generally, you'd load a mobile-specific version of the site by deteting the useragent and push them to the correct subdomain.
[21:36:25] <duch_kazatel> jwmann cool
[21:36:39] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the help! :D
[21:37:05] <duch_kazatel> jwmann of course
[21:42:47] <duch_kazatel> ALL RIGHT FOLKS IT'S BEEN REALLY REAL.
[21:43:32] <naeluhNSA> duch_kazatel: thanks your awesome !
[21:44:05] <duch_kazatel> fshosho
[21:44:21] <duch_kazatel> i'm going to go drink more.  BillCriswell, good luck.
[21:44:37] <naeluhNSA> dude miller lite !!!!!!!!!!!
[21:45:44] <Uhkis> does jquery make ppl drink?
[21:46:44] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I think it's just programming in general.
[21:47:38] <Uhkis> so far i've only heard about perl guys being drunks :-D
[21:52:54] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[21:54:27] <duch_kazatel> pffff my wife is on the phone.
[21:54:29] <duch_kazatel> chatty chatty
[21:55:00] <Aquilas> Hey guys what is the best jquery library to resize images?
[21:55:14] <duch_kazatel> Aquilas jquery,
[21:55:21] <naeluhNSA> duch_kazatel: I thought you were taking off? hahah
[21:55:43] <duch_kazatel> I did go.  but my wife is on the phone and we were going to watch a movie.
[21:55:56] <duch_kazatel> so I was all "fuck that" and now i'm back on IRC.
[21:56:01] <zulcc> Does the callback function of load() change the scope, so that $(this) inside refers to the selected item?
[21:56:21] <duch_kazatel> zulcc depends on what you're doing, but it can.
[21:56:39] <Aquilas> Wait jquery can resize images?
[21:56:58] <zulcc> duch_kazatel: What is the general procedure to find out when something changes the scope?
[21:57:00] <duch_kazatel> Aquilas define what you mean by "resize images"
[21:57:11] <duch_kazatel> zulcc console.log() is a helluva drug
[21:57:34] <duch_kazatel> Aquilas I can make an image appear larger or smaller using javascript.
[21:57:44] <Aquilas> The user selects an image from their machine and I want to make it smaller
[21:58:19] <duch_kazatel> Aquilas you won't be actually resizing the image.
[21:58:27] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't exist.
[21:58:35] <duch_kazatel> you can, however, display a smaller image.
[21:58:45] <duch_kazatel> *smaller version.  css and all that.
[21:58:52] <Aquilas> oh tru
[21:59:00] <Aquilas> I should do that
[21:59:12] <duch_kazatel> :D
[21:59:26] <zulcc> duch_kazatel: Which property of this do you test?
[21:59:53] <duch_kazatel> zulcc I look to see what the object is.
[22:01:13] <zulcc> duch_kazatel: Thanks.
[22:06:34] <zulcc> duch_kazatel: Can you get further information when typeof returns 'object'? It's obviously something that i selected via jQuery, I just want to see what it selects.
[22:06:55] <pom_life> click on it in dev tools?
[22:06:58] <duch_kazatel> console.log($(this));
[22:07:01] <duch_kazatel> do that.
[22:07:08] <duch_kazatel> typeof isn;t helpful for what you want.
[22:07:23] <zulcc> ahh. yes, geat
[22:07:29] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: you know how a button input can be disabled? <input type="button" disabled>
[22:07:39] <pom_life> What would the jquery be to change disabled to enabled?
[22:07:57] <systemfault> pom_life: You use .prop('disabled', false)
[22:08:26] <duch_kazatel> yup - use prop instead.
[22:08:54] <pom_life> You sure do. Jawsome.
[22:08:54] <duch_kazatel> i'd use disabled="disabled" in your markup, too.
[22:09:59] <systemfault> The value is unnecessary in HTML
[22:10:19] <systemfault> In fact, it's just misleading to make that attribute have a value
[22:10:22] <duch_kazatel> sure, but I prefer it for consistency's sake.
[22:10:58] <systemfault> I mean... disabled="enabled" would still create a disabled button
[22:11:11] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: I understand, it's a matter of preference.
[22:11:36] <duch_kazatel> the presence of the disabled attribute is what matters, but I still prefer to give the attribute a value.  "feels" better.
[22:11:48] <systemfault> The XML-style
[22:11:53] <duch_kazatel> yyup
[22:12:18] <duch_kazatel> i prefer xhtml, but alas it is not meant to be.
[22:13:05] <systemfault> Yeah, it's pretty much dead.... the HTML5 spec allows the XHTML form though.
[22:13:31] <duch_kazatel> yup.  http://blog.whatwg.org/xhtml5-in-a-nutshell and all that.
[22:14:17] <duch_kazatel> okay and now my wife is done.  enjoy kids.
[22:14:23] <pikapp> I have a bit of code that runs on document.ready, but I do not see the expected results unless I refresh the page at least once. Any ideas on what I could be doing wrong?
[22:15:00] <pikapp> I have verified that the code runs in both circumstances, but I only get the expected result after refreshing the page
[22:15:28] <pikapp> Should I be using something other than document.ready?
[22:16:29] <systemfault> document.ready is certainly not the problem
[22:17:33] <terriblesarcasm> Does anyone know if there's a linkedin dev channel? Its not #linkedin
[22:17:57] <systemfault> If you find it, tell them to die.
[22:18:19] <Uhkis> :D
[22:18:50] <systemfault> When a site sucks so much it tries to trick its users...
[22:18:50] <terriblesarcasm> Wowie
[22:19:33] <terriblesarcasm> I don't know anything about the site, just need to be able to log in from my app lol
[22:19:45] <systemfault> :P
[22:21:55] <terriblesarcasm> Although the interview I recently went on told me I should really get an account the companies they work with love it
[22:21:56] <terriblesarcasm> ;/
[22:23:14] <systemfault> I got one... that's why I hate it :)
[22:25:31] <terriblesarcasm> I had to make one to get dev access, but unfortunately the API doesn't seem to be working how I want anyway
[22:25:53] <pikapp> systemfault: it ended up being something with Rails (turbolinks): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18770517/rails-4-how-to-use-document-ready-with-turbo-links
[22:26:22] <systemfault> Weird... never used rails
[22:28:31] <pikapp> Yeah, I'm rather new myself. Other than this, it's been pretty smooth
[22:44:16] <hendry> Anyone knows why: var v = $(this).find('video'); // might not work? Don't seem to get the video object.
[22:45:27] <systemfault> Does the video tag exists when that code is executed?
[22:46:24] <morfin> hello
[22:46:32] <morfin> how can i check if this element is last
[22:46:40] <systemfault> last in what?
[22:46:50] <systemfault> Are you using a lib?
[22:47:01] <morfin> as example i need to check if my td is last in tr
[22:47:51] <systemfault> Perhaps you could check is .nextSibling is null
[22:47:58] <morfin> hmm
[22:48:43] <systemfault> mordof: without more info, there's no better way.
[22:56:10] <terriblesarcasm> aw crap I forgot about my android dev homework
[22:56:30] <terriblesarcasm> Anybody else in that coursera course?
[23:20:59] <nights`> time to boot bootstrap
[23:22:58] <systemfault> Good, bootstrap is crap anyway.
[23:23:04] <systemfault> Just learn CSS.
[23:23:38] <nights`> i know CSS
[23:23:44] <nights`> didnt know it 2 years ago
[23:24:01] <nights`> but my code is infected with bootstrap now
[23:24:07] <systemfault> :/
[23:24:07] <nights`> :{
[23:24:10] <Uhkis> systemfault: you're the first person ever to agree with me on that subject
[23:24:11] <systemfault> :''''(
[23:24:18] <nights`> no i agree too
[23:24:19] <Uhkis> about bootstrap sucking that is
[23:24:47] <plepzz> Why is that? :i
[23:24:51] <systemfault> There's a single company for which bootstrap doesn't suck, it's twitter.
[23:24:55] <Cork> building a site in a way where you depend on js for the page to work is a good way to ensure that the page sucks
[23:25:04] <plepzz> I was just considering starting to use it
[23:25:26] <nights`> cork: it depends what type of page
[23:25:31] <Cork> not really
[23:25:32] <nights`> that was too general
[23:25:37] <nights`> so a trading client
[23:25:45] <nights`> that doesnt work without js\
[23:25:48] <Cork> you can always generate a page in that way
[23:25:49] <nights`> why is that a bad idea?
[23:26:03] <Cork> cause you should always have a fallback that works without js
[23:26:10] <Cork> reduced functionality; sure
[23:26:10] <nights`> why exactly?
[23:26:12] <Cork> but it SHOULD work
[23:26:18] <systemfault> nights`: The old mentality.
[23:26:20] <nights`> for what reason
[23:26:22] <nights`> i dont agree
[23:26:24] <Cork> search engines, browsers that don't have it
[23:26:33] <Cork> ppl that won't want to trust random code on the net
[23:26:35] <nights`> if you are a business owner you cant comply with everything
[23:26:35] <Cork> and so on
[23:26:55] <Cork> nights`: writing a page so you add js after you have a base page doens't take longer
[23:27:06] <nights`> hm
[23:27:12] <Cork> it is just a trick flow in how you write the page
[23:27:38] <Cork> 1. generate the backend 2. style the front end 3. add js to smooth things out
[23:27:55] <Cork> instead of 1. generate backend 2. generate js to use the backend
[23:28:14] <Cork> 3. handle all the broken parts cause you didn't follow the intended flow
[23:28:15] <nights`> add js to smooth things out
[23:28:34] <nights`> thats not just to add
[23:28:41] <Cork> it is actually
[23:28:50] <nights`> maybe for like UI effects
[23:28:51] <Cork> let none js just do full page reloads
[23:29:03] <Cork> and then you do partial updates with js
[23:29:09] <nights`> like a shopping cart thats full page reload
[23:29:16] <Cork> ya, sure
[23:29:18] <nights`> switch that to jquery takes some work
[23:29:23] <Cork> uh...
[23:29:23] <nights`> and imagine doing that for the entire site
[23:29:31] <Cork> no it is like 2-3 lines of code
[23:29:41] <nights`> depending on how you wrote your backend
[23:29:45] <Cork> yes
[23:29:53] <Cork> so again how you do it matter
[23:29:54] <Cork> +s
[23:29:59] <nights`> but still
[23:30:04] <Cork> but it doesn't take more work, or is harder
[23:30:12] <nights`> you dont get sued if you dont support IE5 users
[23:30:15] <Cork> you just have to think about it when you do it
[23:30:25] <nights`> and people who still use IE5 are very unlikely to provide business value
[23:30:28] <Cork> nights`: this has nothing to do with old ie
[23:30:31] <nights`> i have a googlebot version
[23:30:42] <nights`> its the ugliest representation i could think of
[23:30:46] <nights`> but it works
[23:30:54] <nights`> but i wrote that in reverse order
[23:30:57] <Cork> and if you instead of taking the extra work to write a specific version for a bot
[23:31:06] <nights`> actually writing JS first forces you to build a good backend
[23:31:07] <Cork> wrote the page to work for everyone from the start you would have a better site
[23:31:12] <nights`> that is structured in rendering modules
[23:31:12] <Cork> no
[23:31:33] <nights`> basically whenever i need no-js functionality
[23:31:38] <Cork> js first is often a guarantee you overcomplicate the site
[23:31:56] <Cork> (been there done that)
[23:32:33] <Cork> progressive enhancement really makes a site easier to manage
[23:32:35] <nights`> i know that you know what you are talking about
[23:32:47] <nights`> but i dont think you argue from a business owners perspective
[23:32:57] <Cork> actually yes i do
[23:33:16] <Cork> unless by business mean "i can charge customers more"
[23:33:23] <nights`> in my case lots of user groups arent worth the sqeeze
[23:33:34] <Cork> cause js first means the site needs more time to keep working
[23:34:02] <Cork> nights`: the problem is you write it backwards and that is why you even have to target it like that
[23:34:28] <Cork> i'm not saying it should look perfect and every thing should work for the most reduced form
[23:34:34] <Cork> but the data should still be accessable
[23:34:35] <nights`> well i keep very good track of what platform/browsers view my site
[23:34:44] <Cork> it is quite easy to have that min start point
[23:35:11] <Cork> well you keep track of the users that can visit the site ya
[23:35:12] <nights`> you are a man of principles
[23:35:14] <nights`> :)
[23:35:22] <Cork> nights`: not really
[23:35:27] <Cork> this is from experience
[23:35:29] <nights`> maybe as a curtesy of others i agree
[23:35:31] <nights`> ok
[23:35:40] <Cork> and writing js first has som big drawbacks
[23:35:43] <TTomiK> I have an input-field that's got a blur-event attached to it. I also have a button that's supposed to close the dialog these both elements are in. Now, user clicks to the input field and decides to close the dialog immediately... How can I prevent the blur action from happening ?
[23:37:13] <nights`> TTomiK: hows the blur event attached?
[23:37:29] <TTomiK> $(document).on('blur',...)
[23:38:36] <TTomiK> but $("input#...").blur( would also work as there's no dynamic inserting
[23:38:56] <systemfault> Hmm, jQuery does magic to make the blur event "bubble"?
[23:41:02] <TTomiK> stopPropagation doesn't work
[23:41:21] <TTomiK> but I don't know how to attach stopPropagation to input from button :) (is it even possible)
