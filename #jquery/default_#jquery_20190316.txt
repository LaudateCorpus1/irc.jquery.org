[18:28:15] <skypce> hi
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> hello
[22:34:38] <aro> is it possible with sortable/droppable to drop elements inside dropped elements
[22:35:15] <robertmaxrees> have you tried? :)
[22:35:48] <aro> yes, to the point where my fingers are nearly bleeding
[22:36:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd try with one container that's the draggable and then make a direct child of that into a droppable.
[22:36:40] <aro> What do you meanj
[22:37:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r9bth4n5/
[22:39:44] <aro> so what do i do to apply the bindigns to that
[22:39:58] <robertmaxrees> are you doing this with jquery ui or html5?
[22:40:12] <robertmaxrees> if it's jqui, you'd initialize them like you would anything else.
[22:40:13] <aro> right now i was using jquery, but ill use whatever works best for it
[22:40:28] <robertmaxrees> so no jquery ui??
[22:40:34] <aro> yes, sorry
[22:40:37] <robertmaxrees> sorry, real confused.  can you share your code?
[22:40:52] <aro> let me see its split into a bunch of files
[22:41:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd just need the rendered markup and your related js.
[22:41:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:41:11] <aro> ok han g on
[22:50:10] <aro> https://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/oVdddB
[22:50:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[22:50:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:50:42] <aro> yeah i know
[22:50:44] <robertmaxrees> can you get this down to the bare minimum?
[22:50:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of everything for the page?
[22:51:45] <aro> maybe i can deploy it on an internal server
[22:51:49] <aro> would that be ok?
[22:51:56] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[22:52:03] <robertmaxrees> that's the opposite of what i'm looking for :)
[22:52:08] <aro> that way you can access it directly as it is
[22:52:16] <aro> like served from the IDE
[22:52:19] <robertmaxrees> nah
[22:52:21] <aro> ok
[22:52:23] <aro> hmm
[22:52:34] <robertmaxrees> you can't make an isolated test case?
[22:52:41] <aro> its got a lot of crap to it
[22:52:48] <robertmaxrees> erm
[22:52:52] <aro> it like uses all these templates and stuff
[22:52:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't need any of the templates.
[22:53:12] <aro> ok
[22:53:13] <robertmaxrees> just the barebones html and js and css. only the stuff directly related to the drag and drop.
[22:53:24] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't necessarily have to look the same.
[22:54:09] <aro> ok, hang on
[23:07:45] <aro> im going to break something
[23:11:19] <robertmaxrees> ?
[23:11:33] <robertmaxrees> okay let's try this: what's the specific js you're using for drag and drop?
[23:11:58] <aro> jquery ui - droppable
[23:12:01] <aro> and soretable
[23:12:03] <aro> sortable
[23:12:11] <robertmaxrees> so you ARE you jquery ui?
[23:12:38] <robertmaxrees> *are using
[23:13:02] <aro> yeah i said that after you said so no jquery ui?
[23:13:33] <robertmaxrees> you said "yes, sorry" - thought you were affirming my statement lol
[23:13:45] <aro> lol sorry my mistake :)
[23:14:03] <robertmaxrees> okay so you have draggables and droppables, right?
[23:14:08] <robertmaxrees> ignore the sorting
[23:14:39] <aro> yes
[23:15:06] <robertmaxrees> so what's the challenge with making an isolated test case??
[23:15:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm just confused.  i'd ignore your page for the moment.
[23:16:44] <aro> what test case do you want me to do? of my current implementation?
[23:17:00] <robertmaxrees> your question was how you'd make an element both draggable and droppable.
[23:17:19] <aro> droppable means it can receive elements right?
[23:17:31] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/
[23:17:32] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[23:18:01] <aro> correct
[23:18:18] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[23:19:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0me5wan1/
[23:19:51] <robertmaxrees> this is what a test case would look like
[23:21:01] <aro> ok
[23:22:35] <aro> this is an example of what ia m doing
[23:22:36] <aro> https://codepen.io/thgreasi/pen/FJrxo
[23:22:54] <aro> uggg its angular
[23:22:56] <aro> nevermind
[23:22:59] * aro vomits
[23:23:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:23:30] <robertmaxrees> so you want to drag and drop between two lists with a sortable?
[23:23:32] <robertmaxrees> or...
[23:23:36] <aro> I have two lists
[23:23:40] <aro> one is a source, the other is target
[23:23:55] <aro> I have certain elements in the Source list which must be able to be droppable too
[23:24:03] <aro> and i dont know how to make them droppable
[23:24:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0me5wan1/7/
[23:24:46] <robertmaxrees> you can drag around the bigger square, and also drop onto it.
[23:24:51] <aro> im using two connected lists though
[23:25:01] <aro> im trying to load i t up again
[23:25:07] <robertmaxrees> so something like https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists ?
[23:25:13] <aro> exactly
[23:25:14] <aro> yes
[23:25:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so start with that and show me what you tried with it :)
[23:25:26] <aro> one list is draggable, the other is sortable
[23:25:33] <aro> the source is draggable
[23:40:48] <aro> so apparently its an outstanding feature request and cannot be done
[23:40:52] <aro> so back to the drawing board
[23:54:01] <robertmaxrees> to make a sortable also a droppable?
