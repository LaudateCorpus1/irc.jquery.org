[03:07:55] <ace_me> I try to validate a input and a select as a group toi be at least one of them filled http://pastie.org/10862579 but the input is never shown with error ! Can you please help me?
[03:08:29] <ace_me> both that fields have required_from_group: [1,".check_grp"]
[03:15:07] <ace_me> can you make it work http://codepen.io/petronel/pen/xOGVBQ ?
[03:25:19] <maxou> Hey dont fin the solution if someone can help me : https://jsfiddle.net/r5z80xmw/8/
[03:25:38] <maxou> i try to change the attr max if the prev input value is INT
[03:26:34] <Cork> maxou: you can't use next as the elements aren't siblings
[03:27:15] <Cork> you would have to do .closest('td').next().find('input.fieldSize')
[03:27:32] <maxou> oh
[03:27:41] <maxou> i try this thx
[03:30:06] <maxou> work thx you
[04:02:49] <joaocastanho> Hello. Is it possible to use FileReader and convert jpeg file to png?
[04:03:21] <Cork> joaocastanho: teckincally, yes, practically, no
[04:03:29] <Cork> though...
[04:03:32] <joaocastanho> okay
[04:03:34] <joaocastanho> how?
[04:03:55] <Cork> you might be able to use canvas
[04:04:03] <joaocastanho> ah right
[04:04:09] <joaocastanho> so filereader can't do it on itself?
[04:04:16] <Cork> yup https://davidwalsh.name/convert-canvas-image
[04:04:26] <joaocastanho> okay. good
[04:04:34] <Cork> joaocastanho: it has no consent of graphic
[04:04:45] <Cork> its just bytes to it
[04:04:56] <joaocastanho> What do you mean?
[04:05:11] <Cork> to convert one image format from one type to another
[04:05:19] <Cork> you have to understand the disk format
[04:05:28] <Cork> and know how to generate the new format
[04:05:36] <Cork> else its just meaning less bytes
[04:05:49] <joaocastanho> disk format = extension ?
[04:05:54] <Cork> no
[04:06:13] <Cork> the structure the pixels are saved on disk in the specific format
[04:06:33] <joaocastanho> okay
[04:06:44] <Cork> jpeg and png is not just an extention change
[04:06:53] <Cork> one is lossy and one is loseless
[04:07:00] <Cork> and they encode the pixels very differently
[04:07:01] <joaocastanho> yeah, transparency
[04:07:04] <Cork> no
[04:07:07] <Cork> its much more then that
[04:07:11] <joaocastanho> okay
[04:07:18] <joaocastanho> and how can I check for that?
[04:07:25] <Cork> check for what?
[04:07:37] <joaocastanho> lossy and loseless
[04:07:45] <Cork> all jpegs are lossy
[04:07:53] <Cork> and all png are loseless
[04:07:57] <joaocastanho> okay
[04:08:01] <Cork> its part of the image format
[04:08:43] <joaocastanho> then I can just convert it
[04:08:51] <Cork> uh
[04:09:09] <joaocastanho> and check for if it's already a png for example?
[04:09:18] <Cork> joaocastanho: why not just do this before hand?
[04:09:32] <Cork> converting a jpeg to png won't give you transparency
[04:09:42] <Cork> it will only give you support for transparency
[04:10:01] <Cork> you still have to modify the pixels you want to be transparent
[04:10:44] <joaocastanho> no need for transparency though
[04:10:58] <Cork> then why the convertion?
[04:11:12] <Cork> you won't gain anything from doing so
[04:11:46] <joaocastanho> i would like to have files in same extension
[04:12:18] <Cork> you should really think this through some more
[04:12:40] <Cork> cause the image will be bigger (as jpeg will cause artifacts so they will be hard for png to encode)
[04:12:49] <Cork> also if it is a photo it will be gigantic as a png
[04:13:06] <Cork> as png is really bad at encoding photos
[04:15:44] <joaocastanho> but if someone uploads a png, I'll have to stick with it then
[04:16:05] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[04:18:03] <joaocastanho> for example, I all png and jpeg uploads
[04:21:35] <joaocastanho> Cork, I have like a original image and a cropped image.
[04:21:44] <joaocastanho> I just wanted both to have same extension
[04:22:02] <Cork> not sure why the extension would matter
[04:22:18] <joaocastanho> I have to convert them in php
[04:22:19] <Cork> the thumbnail should have the same extension as the original
[04:22:25] <joaocastanho> base64 png or base64 jpeg
[04:22:49] <Cork> else you would have converted a jpeg to png and then the thumbnail will be almost as big as the orignal in some cases
[04:22:51] <joaocastanho> it doesnt Cork, because my cropper's default extension is png
[04:23:08] <Cork> joaocastanho: cropping isn't really the point
[04:23:32] <joaocastanho> okay
[04:24:04] <joaocastanho> but as I said the cropper's default is .png
[04:24:49] <joaocastanho> it can have these 3
[04:24:55] <joaocastanho> 'jpeg' 'png' 'webp'
[04:25:35] <Cork> joaocastanho: you should retain the same format as the original
[04:26:22] <joaocastanho> oh, okay.
[04:27:18] <joaocastanho> then I need to find the original extension
[04:27:34] <Cork> joaocastanho: you shouldn't base it on the extension
[04:27:48] <joaocastanho> then how?
[04:27:49] <Cork> if your using imagemagic have it tell you what format the original image is
[04:27:58] <Cork> if your using gd do it there
[04:28:09] <Cork> (those are the two most common libs for this)
[04:28:42] <Cork> basically you can't trust what the extension tells you
[04:28:52] <joaocastanho> Okay, I get your point, but I define cropped extension in js and not in imagemagick
[04:29:24] <Cork> uh
[04:29:29] <Cork> why?
[04:29:54] <joaocastanho> can I paste the link for cropper here?
[04:30:00] <Cork> sure
[04:30:08] <jerit> is $('.class').addClass('foo'); supposed to add .foo to each element with class="class"?
[04:30:16] <joaocastanho> http://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/
[04:30:24] <Cork> jerit: yes
[04:30:39] <joaocastanho> check result promise cork
[04:31:10] <joaocastanho> jerit if you need to add to just one add an ID
[04:31:29] <Cork> joaocastanho: you said you did this in php...
[04:31:32] <Cork> this uses canvas
[04:31:43] <joaocastanho> I'm using php xD
[04:31:54] <joaocastanho> this returns a base64 code
[04:31:59] <Cork> uh...
[04:32:00] <joaocastanho> I have to decode it and convert it
[04:32:28] <Cork> so.. you load a crop js lib and the crop it server side just to have it encode the result as base64?!?
[04:32:36] <Cork> why not just base64 encode it server side??
[04:32:49] <jerit> joaocastanho no need. A friend was doing $('.class').addClass('foo') and it wasn't adding class="foo" to every matching element
[04:33:19] <Cork> jerit: make a jsfiddle.net example of the problem
[04:33:35] <Cork> cause as long as the selector is ran when all elements exist it will
[04:33:35] <jerit> Can't. Not my code
[04:33:47] <Cork> well the problem lacks too much info
[04:33:47] <joaocastanho> Cork, it already crops in on client side
[04:33:54] <joaocastanho> I just have to convert it to an image
[04:34:03] <Cork> jerit: command you gave is still "yes it will"
[04:34:10] <Cork> jerit: the problem lies outside that line
[04:34:23] <joaocastanho> jerit did it even include jquery? :P
[04:34:55] <Cork> joaocastanho: this sounds extremely over complicated
[04:35:05] <Cork> either do the convertion locally, or do it all server side
[04:35:12] <Cork> why double work it like this
[04:35:37] <joaocastanho> Cork, right now my problem does lie on php, because I have to know it's extension
[04:35:47] <Cork> you will just result with worse result from all the extra encoding
[04:36:11] <Cork> joaocastanho: no, cause as you're cropping it js side you need to make sure you encode it correctly
[04:36:20] <Cork> and it sounds like you convert it to png there
[04:36:28] <joaocastanho> why?
[04:36:47] <Cork> ok, i give up
[04:36:59] <Cork> joaocastanho: you really REALLY need to read up on how image formats work
[04:37:15] <Cork> else you will end up destroying the images you process
[04:37:38] <joaocastanho> yes, it's its fefault
[04:40:15] <joaocastanho> Cork:  then what if I had it's default to be jpeg?
[05:00:11] <vjacob> Hello all. How does the selector go in jQuery if I need all classes "x" within a "h2" element?
[05:00:27] <Cork> vjacob: same as in css
[05:00:35] <Cork> $('h2 .x')
[05:00:40] <vjacob> Tried to read up on it and find examples but I keep getting syntax errors...
[05:00:44] <vjacob> thank you Cork!
[06:34:43] <harry1> anyone familiar with moment,js, I'm trying to get the time now in unix taking into account summer time
[06:34:57] <harry1> moment().format('X');
[06:35:13] <harry1> gives me the correct format but it's an hour out
[06:37:25] <Uhkis> harry1: make a fiddle
[06:39:14] <rollingWolf> harry1, moment().unix() iirc
[06:40:19] <rollingWolf> harry1, Youll have to apply DST yourself
[06:42:55] <rollingWolf> eg if( moment().isDST()) { timestampfrommoment += 3600; }
[06:44:18] <harry1> Uhkis: https://jsfiddle.net/jqbpfo6b/
[06:44:20] <rollingWolf> harry1, http://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-daylight-saving-time/ for more info
[06:45:30] <harry1> ok so I need to check for DST and apply the adjust
[06:45:37] <rollingWolf> harry1, Yes
[06:45:39] <ace_me> I try to validate a input and a select as a group toi be at least one of them filled http://pastie.org/10862579 but the input is never shown with error ! Can you please help me?
[06:45:49] <ace_me> http://codepen.io/petronel/pen/xOGVBQ
[06:45:53] <Uhkis> harry1: both are same and correct here
[07:03:54] <joaocastanho> can I put html inside input value ?
[07:10:37] <aaaa^> using jquery-ui's tooltip, how do I have it re-run when an ajax event modifies the dom?
[07:15:27] <Cork> aaaa^: simplest would be to delegate the plugin to a static parent
[07:15:37] <Cork> joaocastanho: no
[07:32:35] <harry1> does anyone know if there are any special requirements to make moment,js work with an xconstructor
[07:33:48] <harry1> see line 10: https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[07:33:58] <harry1> i'm not getting the expected output
[08:06:19] <maasha> Hi, how can I strip all aria attributes from a DOM object?
[08:07:23] <Cork> maasha: you would have to loop it
[08:07:42] <Cork> with element.attributes
[08:08:12] <maasha> no "aria-*" options?
[08:10:18] <maasha> or regex
[08:10:29] <Cork> no
[08:10:42] <Cork> well you would have to use that, but on the property i gave you
[08:11:29] <maasha> how about this? http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[08:11:48] <Cork> it selects elements not attributes
[08:12:01] <maasha> Right, I need both I guess. Thanks
[08:12:24] <Cork> maasha: why do you need to remove aria attributes?
[08:13:03] <maasha> Cork jquery-ui cloning preserves some original info that messes up stuff.
[08:13:29] <Cork> maasha: run the .pluginName('destroy') before cloning
[08:13:32] <maasha> jquery-ui utilizes aria- classes for all sorts of undocumented sneaky things
[08:14:59] <Cork> uh, no
[08:15:07] <maasha> Cork I tried this, but I keep getting unwanted behaviour, so I got sick and tired of trial and error. Manuel cloning it is and no more aria-* undocumented nastiness.
[08:15:10] <Cork> aria is a well documented standard
[08:15:29] <Cork> aria isn't undocumented...
[08:15:34] <maasha> Cork: probably, but I have a feeling that jquery-ui is missusing it.
[08:15:39] <Cork> it isn't
[08:16:03] <Cork> it's heavy use of it is one of the reasons i use it
[08:16:33] <maasha> Cork: so where in the jquery-ui api documentation for sortable does it say what the aria settings is used for?
[08:16:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA
[08:17:36] <Duikb00t> yo Cork
[08:17:39] <Cork> o/
[08:18:17] <harry1> can anyone see why moment.js is not working in this snippet of code - line 10
[08:18:18] <harry1> https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[08:19:03] <Cork> harry1: define "is not working"
[08:19:04] <maasha> Cork: so in this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/vn52ewrk/1/ if I drag an accordion and drop on the list saying foo, then the original stops working
[08:19:29] <maasha> i.e can be opened
[08:20:07] <Cork> maasha: http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:20:12] <Cork> you want .clone(true)
[08:21:32] <maasha> Cork and then when you open the accordion in one list, the original closes in the other list
[08:26:04] <avramel> hey
[08:32:02] <harry1> Cork: I get errors in the console, such as:
[08:32:57] <harry1> socket.io-1.3.5.js:2 GET http://xxxx:socket.io/?EIO=3&transport=polling&t=1464957145807-0 net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[08:33:22] <Cork> that doesn't look related unless you stream your js
[08:33:55] <harry1> if i remove the moment line and use: serverTime: ~~(Date.now() / 1000)+3600
[08:34:01] <harry1> i don't get errors
[08:34:17] <harry1> what is to stream js
[08:34:20] <Cork> harry1: sounds like you have a lib conflict
[08:34:57] <Cork> harry1: socket.io is normally used for things like rocket messaging
[08:35:13] <Cork> but i'm only guessing here
[08:35:34] <harry1> but should it be enough to simple include moment.js in my html header
[08:35:47] <harry1> then refer to it as I have done in that Response.js file
[08:35:52] <harry1> *simply
[08:42:29] <harry1> to me it would appear that the moment() reference is crashing my script
[08:42:43] <harry1> i can't be sure that the library is included properly
[09:09:36] <usingSystem> hi I've used $.parseXML(xml); I wanted to try and search for a node with a value within the xml. Is there a way to do this ? I'm able search for a node, but I need to get a node with a specific value
[09:18:27] <Bacta> Who here knows what happens with the following? $.ajax({..}); document.location.href = 'http://whatever';
[09:19:02] <taplar_> Bacta: if in that order it kicks off an ajax request and then redirects the page
[09:19:14] <taplar_> the ajax may or may not finish before the redirect happens
[09:19:48] <taplar_> though i thought it was window.location.href, not document...
[09:20:00] <Bacta> I've noticed that Firefox aborts the request
[09:20:11] <taplar_> the ajax one?  sure
[09:20:25] <Bacta> And that Chrome doesn't do the redirect until the Ajax request is complete, or at least keeps the Ajax request running...
[09:20:42] <Bacta> There isn't a lot of clear info out there on what's meant to happen
[09:20:47] <taplar_> you should really do the redirect in a done or always for the ajax
[09:20:56] <Bacta> I'm aware of that
[09:21:18] <Bacta> But I've encountered code like this, and then get reports from our QA dept about it not working in Firefox
[09:21:28] <Bacta> But it working in Chrome
[09:21:39] <taplar_> so make it work in both, :)
[09:22:31] <Bacta> I can quite easily
[09:22:40] <taplar_> so what's the issue?
[09:22:46] <Bacta> But I want to fully understand the issue first and why it works different across browsers
[09:23:00] <taplar_> cause browsers are not homogenous?
[09:23:08] <taplar_> it's the whole reason jquery exists
[09:23:09] <Bacta> Hence why I'm asking here to see if others have encountered it
[09:23:41] <taplar_> more of a browser question, outside the scope of jquery
[09:23:59] <Bacta> Ok
[09:28:52] <taplar_> usingSystem: you can use jQuery finders on an xmlDocument it seems: https://jsfiddle.net/trw6dbyq/
[09:30:03] <ales> Hello does anyone know why this piece of js wouldn't toggle my brackets on/off? Thank you http://dpaste.com/22AAP3P
[09:30:37] <taplar_> cause it's in the head and not in a doc ready
[09:30:42] <taplar_> at that point those elements do not exist
[09:31:53] <taplar_> any logic that you have in the head that expects elements to exist in the body of the page should be inside a doc ready to delay their execution until the page is loaded into the DOM.  Otherwise, move your logic to the bottom of your body
[09:32:51] <ales> taplar_ moved to end of body
[09:32:55] <ales> doesnt work
[09:33:14] <taplar_> any console errors?
[09:35:00] <taplar_> the toggle logic alone works fine: https://jsfiddle.net/sfhn1m11/
[09:35:24] <taplar_> your bracket() instantiation has a parsing error though
[09:35:27] <ales> i know taplar_ i think problem is i need to add this toggle in .js file
[09:35:32] <ales> because there i define bracket...
[09:35:38] <ales> could you tell me how?
[09:35:47] <taplar_> ln 26 of your dpaste you have a ;
[09:36:10] <taplar_> and even if that was a comma, that's an invalid object definition
[09:36:38] <taplar_> that array doesn't have a key associated with it
[09:37:01] <taplar_> so you got other stuff going on too
[09:37:14] <ales> i deleted whole line but now i dont like it shows on default.
[09:37:17] <ales> thats not problem.
[09:37:33] <ales> so i removed toggle with .show and still same
[09:37:39] <ales> button not showing bracket..
[09:39:15] <taplar_> i'd have to see your issue in a fiddle to help
[09:40:06] <ales> http://dpaste.com/1MSH0AN
[09:40:09] <ales> this is what i changed
[09:40:31] <taplar_> fiddle please, working example of the issue
[09:40:40] <taplar_> and you still have a parse error with your bracket instantiation
[09:42:14] <taplar_> { key: value, key: value, [] }
[09:42:19] <taplar_> that's not a valid object definition
[09:42:50] <ales> taplar_, please help https://jsfiddle.net/2m5kL5bg/
[09:43:29] <ales> this is what my friend gave me
[09:43:44] <taplar_> ok, so it's toggling it, so what's the issue?  you don't want it to show by default?
[09:45:17] <ales> he gave me fix
[09:45:25] <ales> but it looks weird now
[09:45:27] <ales> on jsfiddle
[09:46:05] <taplar_> ?
[09:46:46] <ales> we fixed it i think taplar_
[09:46:56] <taplar_> ah, cool
[09:47:04] <ales> now maybe you could help us with something else
[09:47:10] <ales> how can we remove zoom things?
[09:47:24] <ales> we steal from github this bracket it is not our and we think its poor coded
[09:47:49] <taplar_> you don't want the zoom buttons?
[09:48:41] <ales> nope
[09:49:11] <taplar_> if the api doesn't have an option to disable them, they have classes 'zoom-in' and 'zoom-out' that you can target and remove or hide
[09:49:34] <ales> sec
[09:49:50] <ales> https://github.com/lipp15/bracket-world
[09:49:52] <ales> here it sais
[09:50:34] <taplar_> yeah, api doesn't say anything about disabling
[09:50:40] <taplar_> so you'd have to manually remove them
[09:50:57] <ales> in .js
[09:51:03] <taplar_> yup
[09:51:16] <taplar_> those are being generated by that plugin
[09:51:29] <taplar_> unless you want to dig in his code and change it
[09:52:01] <ales> why is this jquery code in 1 line taplar_?
[09:52:27] <taplar_> hmm?
[09:52:33] <taplar_> oh
[09:52:43] <taplar_> looks like it may have been minified
[09:53:28] <taplar_> https://github.com/lipp15/bracket-world/blob/master/src/assets/scripts/jquery.bracket-world.js <-- non-minified version
[09:57:24] <ales> lel taplar_ .zoom-in, .zoom-out {display:none}
[09:57:26] <ales> can use thi
[09:57:27] <ales> s
[09:57:35] <taplar_> sure
[09:58:04] <harry1> Cork: were you asking earlier if I am streaming my js?
[09:59:44] <jimduchek> Hey, I've got a line '$(.myclass).val('Value'); -- ('myclass' is always some number of text input fields) -- is there a simpler way to only set the value on empty fields than to do an .each() and explicitly check for empty?
[10:01:10] <decx> val() has an implied each, use a function in it
[10:02:18] <jimduchek> actually, hrm, $('.myclass[value='']').val('Value'), would that work?
[10:02:38] <jimduchek> err I guess "" instead of '' but you get the idea
[10:04:45] <Cork> jimduchek: no, [] is an attribute selector while the value you think of is a property
[10:05:01] <Cork> jimduchek: [value=""] will select all input fields that has value="" in the html
[10:05:08] <Cork> (no matter what they are right now)
[10:07:16] <ales> I'd like to display 2 brackets, when i click button 1 it display bracket1 in <div> when click button 2 in same div displays bracket 2 how do i do that? here is my code https://jsfiddle.net/2m5kL5bg/2/
[10:10:52] <ales> nwm fixed it $('#button1').click(function() {

[10:12:06] <harry1> guys almost 24 hours on the same issue here, anyone got 5 mins to give me some guidance
[10:12:26] <harry1> the alternative being my feel at high velocity into my screen :)
[10:12:31] <harry1> *heel
[10:14:16] <Bacta> harry1: Sure, what is your operating system?
[10:14:57] <harry1> win10
[10:16:47] <Bacta> Well it's no Linux but at least you're not using OSX
[10:16:51] <Bacta> How can we help?
[10:17:19] <harry1> I have a script in my app: https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[10:17:36] <harry1> I want it to use moment.js - see line 10
[10:17:53] <harry1> line 9 is as it was before my edit, I added line 10
[10:18:18] <harry1> but calling 'moment' there causes my other scripts to crash
[10:18:36] <harry1> I am getting EER connection errors on other js libraries
[10:19:10] <Uhkis> var moment = require('moment');
[10:19:34] <Bacta> Heh. I would never write server side code in JS
[10:19:37] <Bacta> Maybe someone else can help
[10:19:43] <taplar_meeting> node is fun
[10:20:09] <Bacta> Hah
[10:20:30] <harry1> should i include the full path to my js directory
[10:20:37] <harry1> ie. var moment = require('js/blah/moment');
[10:20:58] <Uhkis> and i believe #node.js is for node, this is for jquery
[10:21:24] <harry1> opps i didn't even know that it was node
[10:21:43] <harry1> Unkis - can i ask how you could tell?
[10:22:05] <Uhkis> not after that insult!
[10:23:08] <Woet> hi Uhkis ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:23:21] <Uhkis> yo Woet
[10:24:03] <taplar_> i was wondering yesterday if it was node or not
[10:24:27] <Uhkis> that last line was pretty clear
[10:24:54] <taplar_> ah, gotcha.  not sure i saw that yesterday
[10:25:08] <taplar_> odd that he doesn't know it's node, ;)
[10:25:18] <AwkwardCough> also on their documentation page it says "Moment was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js."
[10:25:50] <zafu> hi, is it an error to define function args with a '$' like: function f(txt, $val) ?
[10:25:54] <Uhkis> taplar_: i find that really alarming
[10:25:57] <Bacta> F'ing JS running on the F'ing server
[10:26:03] <zafu> it used to work but know I get a $val undefined
[10:26:16] <taplar_> zafu: that's valid
[10:26:28] <taplar_> $ is a valid character for a variable name
[10:26:33] <zafu> ok
[10:27:39] <Uhkis> there's this pretty common library called jquery which also uses $ ;)
[10:28:05] <taplar_> common?  meh
[10:28:17] <taplar_> i think it's pretty indie
[10:33:43] <gajus> I haven't touched jQuery in a while
[10:34:00] <gajus> whats the proper syntax for selecting all but 1 index
[10:34:02] <gajus> I have tried: $(this).find('td:not(:eq(1))')
[10:34:42] <decx> slice with negative indices
[10:35:10] <gajus> console.log($(this).find('td').not(':eq(1)'));
[10:35:17] <gajus> this didn't work either
[10:35:25] <gajus> weird, I actually expected this one to work
[10:35:55] <gajus> huh, console.log($(this).find('td').not($(this).find('td').eq(1)));
[10:36:09] <gajus> even this doesn't work. I must be doing something wrong
[10:36:44] <gajus> oh wait. I am just stupid. It does work
[10:59:43] <taplar_> you can filter it out to avoid the double lookup: https://jsfiddle.net/4mq0unLd/
[11:01:54] <taplar_> or slice: https://jsfiddle.net/4mq0unLd/1/
[11:10:07] <harry1> guys small victory - I managed to get moment.js in my app
[11:10:32] <harry1> Uhkis: ... was right it was a node.js issue
[11:10:44] <harry1> just had to install the package and it worked
[11:10:52] <harry1> a day figuring this out
[11:10:56] <harry1> ggggr!
[11:46:03] <ales> how could i change here font color? https://jsfiddle.net/2m5kL5bg/3/
[11:46:26] <robertmaxrees> woah what is that.
[11:46:48] <robertmaxrees> you know you can link in external scripts using the "external resources" on the left, right?
[11:47:21] <taplar_> right click on the element and inspect it.  you can see the classes/id associated with them
[11:47:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, the css "color" property is what you want.
[11:51:07] <ales> i know. its working on jsfiddle if i add .body {color: red}
[11:51:11] <ales> but in mine not wokring.
[11:51:24] <robertmaxrees> .body?
[11:51:43] <robertmaxrees> or body
[11:52:12] <ales> why important..its not wokring
[11:53:08] <robertmaxrees> because .body is for a class.
[11:53:10] <ales> .body {	color: red !important;}
[11:53:11] <robertmaxrees> body is for the body element.
[11:53:13] <ales> not even this..
[11:53:39] <robertmaxrees> drop the period in front of body
[11:53:46] <ales> same .
[11:53:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2m5kL5bg/6/
[11:54:00] <robertmaxrees> works.
[11:55:22] <decx> that plugin is a mess
[11:55:36] <ales> i know it works on jsfiddle
[11:55:38] <ales> but not on mine,
[11:55:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:55:41] <ales> localhost
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> then show us.
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> 5bucks says you have other css conflicting.
[11:56:02] <ales> yeah.
[11:56:03] <taplar_> i'd do .team-name, .team-seed instead of body
[11:56:16] <robertmaxrees> inspect the page and see what the inspector says.
[11:57:07] <ales> so thx taplar_ i did .team-name {color:red !important}
[11:57:09] <ales> something overwriting
[11:57:15] <ales> dont have time for fix.
[11:57:19] <ales> so i'll just use this.
[11:57:30] <taplar_> lol, granular rules are better anyway
[11:57:34] <taplar_> this 'is the fix
[11:57:34] <decx> doesnt make the plugin better tho
[11:57:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:58:56] <ales> lol can't do font-size ? taplar_..
[11:59:46] <ales> color doesnt even bother me its just on my localhost opacity is so bad..
[11:59:56] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:00:00] <taplar_> huh?  i did font size in the fiddle
[12:00:34] <ales> http://imgur.com/iMiAn8G see
[12:00:43] <ales> idk something overwriting.. makes me mad lol :)
[12:00:48] <robertmaxrees> *overriding
[12:01:38] <taplar_> easy enough to right click, inspect and see what rule is overriding it
[12:01:50] <taplar_> you have tools you can use to debug with bro
[12:02:14] <ales> k i did inspect
[12:02:30] <ales> now what?
[12:02:41] <taplar_> right side you should see tabs
[12:02:45] <taplar_> one of which is the rules
[12:04:22] <ales> .line-number {
[12:04:22] <ales>     text-align: right;
[12:04:22] <ales>     color: rgb(128, 128, 128);
[12:04:22] <ales>     word-break: normal;
[12:04:22] <ales>     white-space: nowrap;
[12:04:22] <ales>     font-size: 9px;
[12:04:24] <ales>     font-family: Helvetica;
[12:04:26] <ales>     -webkit-user-select: none;
[12:04:28] <ales> }
[12:04:30] <ales> i think this
[12:04:32] <ales> its gray color
[12:04:49] <taplar_> so there ya go
[12:05:02] <ales> so i try overwrite not workin
[12:05:18] <taplar_> your rule needs to be more specific than that rule
[12:06:39] <taplar_> something is weird here
[12:06:48] <taplar_> there is no element with the line-number class in that fiddle
[12:08:09] <ales> eh i found font-weight was overriding somewhere
[12:08:17] <ales> ... so i changed to -bold now it looks better.
[12:12:06] * taplar_ zombie walks out of his cube crying, "fooooooooood"
[12:20:15] <ales> this is not js can anyone answer?  how would i add to this bracket on side bars (left, right) new vertical divs for ads? https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2m5kL5bg/6/
[12:20:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:20:38] <robertmaxrees> are you asking for css help?
[12:20:58] <ales> yes i asked in css and here
[12:21:06] <robertmaxrees> let CSS take care of you then :)
[12:21:13] <ales> dont think anyone there
[12:21:14] <ales> :)
[12:21:23] <robertmaxrees> wait a few - somebody will help when they have some time.
[12:21:38] <ales> sorry i use your fiddle :P makes you unproffesional sorry :)
[12:21:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[12:22:00] <robertmaxrees> how does that make me unprofessional?
[12:22:00] <ales> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2m5kL5bg/6/
[12:22:04] <ales> see its you :)
[12:22:08] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:22:12] <robertmaxrees> how does that make me unprofessional?
[12:22:42] <ales> asking questions which are relativily known :=
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:32:03] <chrisfarrugia> hi everyone.  Does anybody have a recommendation for a really good AutoComplete plugin that can handle large amounts of data?  Thanks
[12:32:11] <robertmaxrees> how much data?
[12:32:26] <chrisfarrugia> 6k rows?
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[12:32:35] <taplar_away> for an auto complete?
[12:32:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd use one that uses ajax.
[12:32:47] <robertmaxrees> and hit your server for that data.
[12:32:57] <chrisfarrugia> ok
[12:32:59] <chrisfarrugia> thank you
[12:34:15] <taplar_away> the jquery ui autocomplete works fine with ajax, look at the source(s) option
[13:07:29] <ahoo> <button data-chartid="line" />
[13:07:45] <ahoo> why doesn't 'button[data-chartid="line"]' work?
[13:07:58] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't select on data attributes anyway.
[13:08:09] <ahoo> advice ignored
[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[13:08:17] <ahoo> thx anyway
[13:08:20] <ahoo> anyone?
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[13:08:26] <ahoo> thx

[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8x3u6jbf/ fwiw.
[13:10:24] <taplar_away> ya, works fine
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ignore us, though.
[13:11:16] <Uhkis> :D
[13:12:01] <ahoo> yea
[13:12:05] <ahoo> i had a typo
[13:12:12] * ahoo punches himself in the face
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> i really strongly encourage you to use classes instead.
[13:12:17] <ahoo> thx
[13:12:50] <ahoo> robertmaxrees: i know what i know
[13:12:56] <ahoo> robertmaxrees: so don't...
[13:13:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:13:08] <decx> you know nothing
[13:13:13] <ahoo> i do
[13:13:15] <ahoo> i am smart.
[13:13:25] <taplar_away> you can't assume to come into a room about a topic and not expect advice about poor practices
[13:13:28] <decx> it's spelled smrt
[13:13:41] <Uhkis> yeah, bobbie doesn't know anything
[13:13:45] <ahoo> taplar_away: i expect what i expect
[13:13:51] <ahoo> thanks for all your advice.
[13:13:54] <taplar_away> ok, have a nice day trump
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> your expectations are unrealistc then, ahoo
[13:14:05] <Uhkis> taplar_away: that was low
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:14:12] <taplar_away> yet i feel great about it
[13:15:37] <taplar_away> oh sorry, drumpf
[13:17:05] <Uhkis> on that topic, man it's annoying when hilarious clinton gives her speeches, starts yelling and her voice breaks hard
[13:17:19] <robertmaxrees> heh so let's not talk politics in here.
[13:17:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:17:28] <taplar_> I've managed to void 98% of all the stuff this cycle
[13:17:49] <Uhkis> i wasn't talking about politics, i was talking about bad voice control!
[13:17:54] <decx> the occasional dagger is ok
[13:18:14] <decx> that's because she's a nerd
[13:18:16] <decx> btw
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> anybody working on anything cool today?
[13:19:46] <Uhkis> if only
[13:20:07] <AwkwardCough> testing woo
[13:20:42] <taplar_> i'm looking at trees
[13:20:48] <taplar_> boom, i win
[13:21:06] <decx> got a rare drop from a boss monster
[13:21:10] <taplar_> game?
[13:21:19] <decx> terraria
[13:21:20] <AwkwardCough> or murder in an office?
[13:21:36] <taplar_> lol
[13:21:40] <Uhkis> made a pizza dough and testing out cold fermentation
[13:21:43] <taplar_> i feel trolled again
[13:21:44] <decx> that's about the coolest thing that happened at work today ^^
[13:22:14] <Uhkis> decx: was it the pantera monster
[13:22:18] <taplar_> Uhkis: how does that work?  just takes longer for the yeast gestation?
[13:22:33] <decx> it was the moon lord on expert
[13:22:59] <Uhkis> taplar_: 3-5 days in fridge after normal fermentation
[13:23:17] <Uhkis> probably cant wait and try it out on sunday though
[13:23:29] <decx> letting the dough sit is overrated anyway
[13:23:33] <taplar_> ah.  hmm, this game makes me think of an example of a game development language i saw once
[13:23:43] <decx> doesnt matter unless you got a 500°F oven
[13:23:47] <AwkwardCough> does the cold fermentation do anything different for the dough?
[13:24:07] <Uhkis> AwkwardCough: its supposed to be tastier!
[13:24:39] <taplar_> cough now has a project for the weekend
[13:25:21] <AwkwardCough> lol no kidding, ive only made dough by letting it sit with a damp rag before, never heard of cold fermentation till a few google taps ago
[13:25:37] <taplar_> didn't you do that bag thing our tech lead brought up?
[13:25:47] <taplar_> or some one brought up
[13:26:09] <AwkwardCough> yeah the unending yeast dough yeah
[13:26:13] <AwkwardCough> it molded :/
[13:26:17] <taplar_> :o
[13:26:23] <taplar_> and you tried to pawn that crap off on me
[13:26:37] <taplar_> i see how it is
[13:26:38] <Uhkis> :D
[13:26:42] <AwkwardCough> well that was before I found out it was bad ish
[13:27:09] <taplar_> it's superman without his powers bread!   what?  unleven!
[13:27:13] <taplar_> i'm sorry about that one
[13:27:18] <decx> might not be bad
[13:27:25] <decx> migth be an antibiotic
[13:27:34] <decx> or some ergot shit
[13:27:57] <AwkwardCough> i mean someone has to eventually find the next big penicillin right?
[13:28:08] <decx> or lsd
[13:28:24] <taplar_> i think big penicillin would be hard to take
[13:28:32] <decx> it's a suppository
[13:28:36] <decx> i dough form
[13:28:42] <decx> in*
[13:28:47] <taplar_> lmao
[13:28:54] <taplar_> so wrong
[13:29:19] <Uhkis> "when i get sick, i just mold up some pizza dough and stick it up my ass"
[13:29:37] <decx> that's what newyorkers think of chicago i heard
[13:35:51] <Uhkis> so, what's THE autocomplete plugin?
[13:36:21] <taplar_> that annoying friend that finishes all the things you start to say
[13:37:06] <taplar_> the plugin being his open mouth.  which is why your compelled to grab a sock and...
[13:37:31] <Baako> hi guys quick question i have this code http://kopy.io/43qi2 the thing is orderprice does not exist when the page loads. it gets added on towards the end of things. The issue i am having is that evennt though i have a delegate on document the text "hello" doesnt seem to show in the #orderprice id but if i run the code on console when the orderprice div comes up the world hello shows. Why is that please
[13:38:06] <Uhkis> https://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/ this one looks nice and clean, but what's the most popular one
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis there's probably a pretty even split between that one, the one in jqui, the one from bootstrap, etc.
[13:38:43] <ahoo> the one that is highest ranked in the google search result
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[13:38:54] <robertmaxrees> maybe check github.
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> Baako are you clicking that button before #orderprice exists?
[13:39:58] <Uhkis> that's why i asked, there's so many to choose from
[13:40:17] <robertmaxrees> also: popularity doesn't mean it's any good for your project :)
[13:40:18] <Baako> robertmaxrees, #orderpice gets added
[13:40:31] <Baako> then i click on aa button which has the delegate
[13:40:32] <robertmaxrees> Baako your code won't work until after it exists in th epage.
[13:41:03] <Baako> robertmaxrees, it does exist in the page after jquery added the div for it
[13:41:15] <robertmaxrees> Baako right, but your code won't do anything until after it's added.
[13:41:27] <Baako> it is ADDED
[13:41:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you think repeating yourself is going to change my answer.
[13:42:04] <Baako> i even did a console.log around #order .text hello
[13:42:24] <Baako> and it shows that they is exist but the hello doesnt sho
[13:42:25] <Baako> show
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($('[id='orderprice']).length);
[13:42:55] <robertmaxrees> errr, wait.
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="orderprice"]').length);
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> there.
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[13:43:11] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: well anything is better than current load all the json and use chosen :D
[13:43:29] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis anyhing that lets you set a remote source it what you want imo.
[13:44:21] <Uhkis> then again might be a fun exercise to write one myself..
[13:44:48] <Baako> robertmaxrees, i get 1
[13:44:57] <taplar_> are you sure your filter selection is correct?
[13:45:02] <decx> Uhkis: typeahead for jquery
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> Baako who knows then?  without seeing it I'm just sort of taking shots in the dark.
[13:45:32] <Baako> console.log($("#orderprice").text("hello")); shows
[13:45:39] <Baako> [span#orderprice, context: document, selector: "#orderprice"]
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell you anything fwiw.
[13:45:51] <taplar_> uh, no
[13:45:55] <taplar_> the filter selector on the delegate
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> i would assume that's good taplar_ if they're getting the logs to fire on click.
[13:46:45] <taplar_> ah, missed that if so
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> Baako those are firing on click, right?
[13:47:06] <Baako> yes robertmaxrees
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.
[13:47:16] * taplar_ shrugs
[13:47:40] <taplar_> orderprice is a div?
[13:47:57] <taplar_> span, whatev
[13:47:57] <Baako> span taplar_
[13:48:04] <taplar_> so that's fine
[13:48:11] <robertmaxrees> can you show us more?
[13:59:39] <taplar_> apparently he's not form louisana
[13:59:50] * taplar_ sings "i can't spell"
[14:01:00] <taplar_> btw catalpa and empress trees are pretty
[14:01:26] <Uhkis> pix?
[14:01:32] <taplar_> one sec
[14:01:38] <taplar_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalpa
[14:02:07] <taplar_> http://www.henriettes-herb.com/files/images/photos/p/pa/d04_2966_paulownia-tomentosa.jpg
[14:02:22] <taplar_> apparently the empress one is considered invasive i guess
[14:04:49] <Uhkis> :-)
[14:05:47] <taplar_> one of my grandparents had something like one of those.  i guess it was the catalpa.  i remember they were fun as a kid
[14:06:00] <taplar_> pretend to make clothes and stuff out of the big leaves
[14:06:33] <taplar_> hardly ever see them any where else
[14:08:08] <Uhkis> i like terijoensalavas
[14:09:09] <Uhkis> http://puutarha.net/keskustelu/aihekuva.asp?id=421306
[14:09:29] <taplar_> has a bushy look to it
[14:09:46] <Uhkis> yeah
[14:10:14] <Uhkis> they have really big color difference on the sides of the leaves so wind makes them look all wavy :)
[14:10:29] <taplar_> nice
[14:11:26] <Baako> robertmaxrees, show you how?
[14:11:45] <Uhkis> Baako: like a fiddle
[14:11:48] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is awesome.
[14:12:52] <AwkwardCough> it also helps just trying to recreate the error out of your code, gives a more direct look
[14:13:07] <Baako> Uhkis, I found the issue
[14:13:11] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[14:14:06] <Uhkis> /nick rubberduck
[14:14:33] <Baako> i override it twice forgot to remove an listener i used for testing
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:40] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: jsfiddle /used to be/ awesome
[14:14:47] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis still is imo.
[14:14:54] <robertmaxrees> Baako notice how there's no way we could've ever figured that out?
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:15:27] <Uhkis> Kartagis: why not anymore?
[14:15:48] <Kartagis> no auto-indent anymore, no jslint anymore, no http-only anymore (enforces SSL therefore XHRs blow)
[14:15:53] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:15:54] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> there's a tidy there.
[14:16:12] <Kartagis> I know
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> i prefer that tbh.
[14:16:35] <Kartagis> I shouldn't have to hit tidy all the time
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm not using it as an ide - i'm using it for test cases (shrug)
[14:16:43] <Uhkis> but there's that autoclose now!
[14:16:45] <Baako> robertmaxrees, sorry about that
[14:16:57] <Uhkis> autopair might be a better word
[14:17:12] <robertmaxrees> but meh.,  whatever floads your boat.
[14:17:29] <robertmaxrees> *floats
[14:17:32] <Uhkis> floods? :D
[14:17:35] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:17:58] <Kartagis> what irritates me the most is that it enforces SSL so XHRs blow
[14:18:10] <robertmaxrees> i haven't had any issues with that.
[14:18:28] <robertmaxrees> then again i use the ajax stuff they provide so it's not really a big deal.
[14:19:09] <Kartagis> what is it that they provide?
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[14:19:29] <robertmaxrees> the /echo endpoint.
[14:20:44] <Uhkis> echo.. echo.. echo..
[14:20:55] <AwkwardCough> echo.. echo.. echo..
[14:23:20] * taplar_ coughs
[14:24:38] <AwkwardCough> touche
[14:25:06] <Kartagis> this is Kartagis testing one two three
[14:35:11] <dogarrhea> $("p") should get an array like structure of all p tags on the page or just the element itself if it's just one right?
[14:35:25] <dogarrhea> apparently this is not working for me it only finds exactly one <p>
[14:36:11] <dogarrhea> hrm it does this even on google.com $("div") exactly one div i thought it should find everythign
[14:36:30] <rcyr> dogarrhea: jQuery is not loaded.
[14:36:34] <bango2> should find all
[14:36:46] <systemfault> dogarrhea: Be sure jQuery is loaded and try again.
[14:38:47] <dogarrhea>  VM677:1 $(selector, [startNode]) { [Command Line API] } from console.log($)
[14:39:18] <systemfault> Sure, jQuery is _NOT_ loaded.
[14:40:09] <dogarrhea> guess i'll have to do this the hard way
[14:40:12] <dogarrhea> document.find element stuff
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[14:40:31] <systemfault> Some morons at Google decided at one point to use the $ sign in their console as a shortcut to document.querySelector
[14:40:48] <systemfault> Because you know, it was possibly a great idea to confuse tons of people.
[14:41:07] <robertmaxrees> unless jquery is loaded fwiw.
[14:41:07] <taplar_> function($){ /* live with it */ }(jQuery);
[14:41:29] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Been saying dogarrhea that jQuery was not loaded for the last 10 minutes.
[14:41:41] <systemfault> saying to
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> that's why usually we suggest you do $.fn.jquery to see what you get.
[14:42:15] <systemfault> Good idea, will suggest that next time
[15:14:14] <Kartagis> what does that do taplar_? I mean function($) { ... } (jQuery);
[15:14:55] <taplar_> it's an IIFE that allows you to use $ inside it without having to worry about the global conflict state
[15:16:03] <Kartagis> talk to me like I'm 4
[15:16:21] <Kartagis> like jQuery(...) ?
[15:16:34] <taplar_> yes, however it's not a document ready so it doesn't have that overhead
[15:17:36] <htmlend> If someone is able have a look at this question for me that would be greatly appreciated! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37621127/how-to-include-the-image-description-when-the-lightbox-is-open-for-gallerificplu?noredirect=1
[15:22:21] <taplar_> htmlend: do you have an example of what your doing right now?
[15:24:17] <htmlend> taplar_: This is a site that makes use of the plugin in discussion http://www.cockermouthselfcatering.co.uk/gallerific/index.htm. Notice how when you click the image to open the lightbox only the title "Allonby" is being displayed. I would like for the description to display as well.
[15:26:05] <taplar_> where is the desired description?
[15:27:56] <htmlend> right underneath the image before you open the lightbox you will see the title which is "Allonby" and the description which just happens to be "description". But when you open the lightbox only the title is displayed within.
[15:28:24] <taplar_> i more meant where is the description for each image in the markup
[15:28:47] <taplar_> also it's acting strange for me in FF.  i click a page and the title and description show, and then they fade away really quick
[15:30:53] <taplar_> can you make a small example of this in jsfiddle.net ?
[15:33:19] <htmlend> im using chrome. But line 27-42 you can see the use of description="". So this would need to be pulled into a span that would be added in the js file. similar to how the content in title="" is pulled into <span id="lightbox-image-details-caption"></span>
[15:34:36] <taplar_> sure.  however it's hard for me to tinker with a live site
[15:34:41] <Uhkis> cock 'er mouth doesnt really scream catering :D
[15:34:55] <taplar_> self catering
[15:35:13] <taplar_> they're flexible
[15:36:25] <htmlend> haha
[15:36:44] <htmlend> Im working on a fiddle but have a bit of trouble making it work on the fiddle
[15:37:08] <Uhkis> htmlend: do tell
[15:42:07] <htmlend> I appreciate the patience. http://codepen.io/bobtod/pen/mEJMVB
[15:43:52] <htmlend> I posted the code directly from github but it doesnt seem to work on codepen or jsfiddle. Im sure im doing something wrong here. But when I use the code from that github link locally it does work similar to http://www.cockermouthselfcatering.co.uk/gallerific/index.htm and http://akrene.no/gallplus/
[15:44:16] <taplar_> you can link to github files with rawgit.com
[15:45:14] <Uhkis> or just use the raw button on github
[15:45:23] <taplar_> and btw, why are you doing this?
[15:45:24] <taplar_> document.write("<style type='text/css'>div.navigation{width:300px;float: left;}div.content{display:block;}</style>");
[15:45:49] <Uhkis> i think that was from the copypasted plugin code
[15:45:58] <taplar_> that's on his live site
[15:46:18] <taplar_> his/her
[15:46:19] <Uhkis> heh, i think i havent seen document.write in over 10 years
[15:46:20] <htmlend> neither site I linked you to are mine. Just folks I noticed using the plugin
[15:47:10] <htmlend> My appologies if I am being difficult in any sense. I am still learning javascript.
[15:49:15] <taplar_> here, this fiddle has that plugin in it.  put your example in here: https://jsfiddle.net/nhejnqL0/
[15:49:16] <htmlend> uhkis: The code I used in that code pen is directly from that github using the raw button
[15:49:54] <htmlend> taplar_: Do i just fork that and add the raw code?
[15:50:24] <taplar_> put your html and your javascript in the associated boxes and hit update.  you only have to put your logic.  jquery and that plugin are already included
[15:51:39] <htmlend> https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/2/
[15:53:16] <taplar_> some reason that plugin is complaining about $.browser
[15:54:27] <taplar_> ah, must be something that was deprecated
[15:54:32] <taplar_> 1.6 works
[15:55:21] <htmlend> version 1.6 of what?
[15:55:26] <taplar_> jquery
[15:55:31] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/4/
[15:55:46] <taplar_> the plugin is using it's own copy of jquery which is at 1.3 which is pretty old
[15:56:24] <htmlend> when switching the jquery version to 1.6 in jsfiddle it still doesnt show that large image or open a lightbox...strange
[15:56:37] <taplar_> yeah, something else is messed up
[15:57:25] <htmlend> Sorry I have never had so much trouble making a fiddle before. I've been trying to figure out how to do this for hours now haha
[15:58:17] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/10/
[15:58:59] <htmlend> What was the issue?
[15:59:10] <taplar_> the css that's being written to the document was missing
[15:59:27] <taplar_> ok, so you want the description to update
[16:01:48] <taplar_> uh, that works dude
[16:01:59] <taplar_> but all your description="" are 'Description'
[16:02:33] <htmlend> I want the description to be display in the lightbox
[16:02:44] <taplar_> it is
[16:02:48] <taplar_> why do you think it isn't?
[16:03:05] <htmlend> because it does not say the word description
[16:03:30] <taplar_> says description for me.  where are you saying it doesn't say description?
[16:04:07] <damoncasale> Afternoon all.
[16:04:31] <damoncasale> So, I'm in a custom environment that SEEMS to already have jQuery and jQuery UI loaded.  Except they don't use the $.
[16:04:47] <damoncasale> I can type jQuery.ui.dialog in the console and see the dialog function.
[16:04:49] <htmlend> taplar_:http://picpaste.com/lightbox-xJk2JaiQ.JPG
[16:04:57] <damoncasale> But, if I type jQuery(selector).dialog, I get undefined.
[16:04:59] <damoncasale> Help?
[16:05:10] <htmlend> when you open you click the large image to open the lightbox it only shows the title.
[16:05:19] <damoncasale> Is there a way to trigger a dialog via jQuery.ui.dialog instead of jQuery(selector).dialog?
[16:05:28] <taplar_> aaaaaaah
[16:05:29] <htmlend> **when click the large image to open the lightbox it only shows the title.
[16:06:00] <taplar_> damoncasale: what is console.log( jQuery(selector).length ) ?
[16:06:11] <damoncasale> Let me check, sec.
[16:06:31] <damoncasale> It's 1.
[16:07:00] <taplar_> and your trying to do jQuery(selector).dialog() ?
[16:07:05] <damoncasale> Yes.
[16:07:29] <taplar_> huh, should work if that ui has been included
[16:07:49] <damoncasale> Right, and it's probably because this is a weird, custom environment that I have no control over.
[16:07:58] <damoncasale> So I can't "fix" it by including the right files.
[16:08:12] <damoncasale> Is there any way to call jQuery.ui.dialog and pass in the selector?
[16:09:12] <damoncasale> Oh wait...shit.
[16:09:21] <damoncasale> jQuery UI *is* in there...but dialog isn't.
[16:09:28] <damoncasale> So it's apparently a custom build.
[16:09:46] <damoncasale> I guess I can try JUST including jQuery.ui.dialog, then...  :-/
[16:14:04] <htmlend> taplar_: Sorry, did you understand what I meant?
[16:14:21] <taplar_> yeah i'm looking at the source to see if there's a way to hook into it
[16:15:47] <htmlend> taplar_: You dont understand how much this means to me man. You can bet that when I get better I will be helping people out like this as well.
[16:16:42] <htmlend> I would imagine it would be hooked in the same way as the title was hooked in
[16:36:33] <taplar_> i'm not seeing an easy way to hook into this right now
[16:37:21] <taplar_> i looks like the image link for the lightbox isn't being constructed with the description, so even if you could hook into it to put it on the lightbox, it's not there to grab
[16:38:01] <taplar_> so you'd have to figure out how to react to the initial gallerific transition to capture/carry over the description for the later reaction to the lightbox view
[16:38:30] <taplar_> imho, it might be better to try to find a new plugin.  especially given the old version of jQuery this one is using and that the plugin hasn't been updated in 5 years.
[16:39:20] <taplar_> plus pretty much a complete lack of an api, :s
[16:39:51] <htmlend> Im not sure what else I should try and use
[16:40:15] <htmlend> one person told me to do this. fetch('youserver/query').then(r=>r.json()).then(r=>desc.textContent = r)
[16:40:23] <htmlend> but i havnt a clue what that means to be honest.
[16:40:46] <taplar_> this concept that your after is pretty much an image carousel, right?
[16:40:49] <taplar_> plus the lightbox
[16:41:47] <taplar_> http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/carousel/
[16:42:01] <taplar_> you can also search for sliders or some other tag.
[16:42:22] <htmlend> http://picpaste.com/140ba4eb58d736dec73de941f414711e.JPG
[16:42:52] <htmlend> It needs to look like this and when i click the thumbnails the large image changes. When i click the large image a lightbox with a title and description need to open
[16:43:24] <htmlend> How is the title generated into the lightbox for the plugin we are currently discussing?
[16:43:42] <taplar_> it's explicitly putting it on the link and looking for it when it opens the lightbox
[16:43:59] <taplar_> it's not doing anything with description other than the first show
[16:44:07] <taplar_> afai could see
[16:44:46] <taplar_> if you want to jump in and modify the plugin, then that is an option for you, :)
[16:45:13] <htmlend> what do you mean
[16:45:37] <htmlend> I figured modifying the html or js was going to be required
[16:45:56] <htmlend> Also I really appreciate all this help taplar_ , you have been great!
[16:47:48] <taplar_> what i mean is the plugin doesn't appear to be made so that it carries the description to the lightbox part.  and it doesn't look like it exposes anything that you can hook into easily to make it do that.
[16:48:01] <taplar_> so you might have to change the plugin itself to make it do that
[16:49:22] <htmlend> I dont think I have enough knowledge to do so. I cant beleive no one else from what I can tell has mentioned this on stackoverflow or anything
[16:49:55] <taplar_> it may not be that popular of a plugin.  there are a ton of slider/slideshow/carousel plugins out there
[16:50:05] <htmlend> Yeah
[16:50:17] <htmlend> This one is just perfect for my needs. But this is the one issue im having
[16:54:28] <htmlend> Is there no way to grab the text in description="" (line 27 https://github.com/coldfumonkeh/gallerificPlus/blob/master/index.htm) show in a span within the lightbox?
[16:55:04] <taplar_> not saying there isn't a way.  i just didn't see it while I was looking at it.
[16:55:28] <taplar_> i can only spend so much time on non-work stuff, :)
[16:56:18] <htmlend> Haha I understand! If you ever have the chance to look over it again please do shoot me a pm :) Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
[16:56:35] <taplar_> sure.  sorry i couldn't help more
[16:58:20] <htmlend> I just asked once more on the javascript channel so maybe someone will save the day
[16:59:03] <taplar_> well there are others here too that might can help.
[16:59:52] <htmlend> I hope so. Perhaps they just are not active at the moment.
[17:16:54] <taplar> htmlend: or actually this might be it
[17:16:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/13/
[17:29:29] <taplar> lol, i just realized i'm the only one left on my team still here.  slackers...
[17:33:53] <diamonds> is there a simple way of turning an array of jquery collections into 1 jquery collection?
[17:35:32] <diamonds> i.e. [$('#foo'), $('#bar')]
[17:36:16] <taplar> you can add() one to the other
[17:36:55] <taplar> oh you mean a literal array of jquery objects
[17:38:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hr0hwdqs/
[17:46:57] <diamonds> thank you!!
