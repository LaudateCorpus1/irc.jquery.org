[00:00:02] <easyOnMe> do you think that would work
[00:02:51] <arc_> hm, actually i don't know what i was thinking. it doesn't update for the same reason that it doesn't output correctly
[00:03:08] <arc_> i'm trying to think of when you can update the value that will always work
[00:06:03] <arc_> ok, you don't have to. in the out function just subtract 1 from the value of $('.new').length
[00:06:22] <arc_> you want to avoid using an iterator like that because it can get out of sync, but if it's always based on the actual number of objects, it won't get out of sync
[00:07:29] <easyOnMe> arc_: ok so which one shall we try now
[00:07:39] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/22/
[00:07:39] <easyOnMe> your idea or the one I suggested
[00:08:14] <arc_> i made a little box at the top so you can just click to update the value of count, it's just easier to look at the current value that way
[00:09:43] <arc_> anyway, i already see your next problem and unfortunately i have no clue whatsoever about how to solve it. prior to helping you, i had never used jquery draggable before
[00:10:06] <arc_> when you drag from one .boxes to another .boxes, the results are very strange
[00:10:22] <easyOnMe> arc_: what do you mean
[00:10:27] <arc_> about what
[00:10:48] <easyOnMe> about .boxes being dragged to another .boxes
[00:10:56] <easyOnMe> actually last night it got even weirder
[00:11:07] <arc_> drag a .sticker to the top left box, then drag that same sticker to the top right box
[00:11:21] <easyOnMe> because if you just drag out sometimes the .sticker sticks outside of the droppables and are not even removed
[00:12:09] <arc_> i haven't experienced that. other than dragging a sticker from one .boxes to another, everything seems to work like you would expect it to
[00:12:26] <easyOnMe> arc_: let me confirm what I see
[00:13:01] <easyOnMe> when I drag one sticker to the top left box it was attached to it then I drag it again going to the top right and it got faded out and remove
[00:13:05] <easyOnMe> but the count was still one
[00:13:14] <easyOnMe> I just discovered something
[00:13:25] <arc_> actually i do know how to fix it
[00:13:33] <arc_> hang on
[00:13:46] <easyOnMe> arc_: wait which one are you fixing
[00:14:03] <easyOnMe> ok
[00:15:05] <arc_> the unintended behavior when you drag a sticker from one .boxes to another .boxes
[00:15:34] <easyOnMe> arc_: and what is that unintended behavior you are seeing
[00:15:55] <easyOnMe> the sticker getting faded out and remove is that the one you are trying to solve
[00:16:46] <easyOnMe> arc_: oh yeah I see
[00:16:49] <easyOnMe> ok
[00:16:51] <arc_> no, the sticker appears outside the boxes and then you can't remove it
[00:17:01] <easyOnMe> yes yes that is what I was referring to
[00:17:04] <easyOnMe> correct
[00:17:14] <easyOnMe> that is the second problem actually
[00:20:39] <easyOnMe> arc_: there is also another problem
[00:21:14] <easyOnMe> when we drag the box out and touch it on another box the count gets incremented by 1 and the sticker gets remove
[00:21:19] <easyOnMe> hahaha
[00:21:26] <easyOnMe> seems we got two problems now
[00:21:52] <arc_> that is related to the first problem
[00:23:52] <easyOnMe> arc_: it because of this $(this).children("." + cssClass).length > 0 <===== condition
[00:24:13] <easyOnMe> the browser gets confused maybe
[00:24:37] <arc_> that doesn't exist on my screen
[00:24:42] <easyOnMe> when we drag it to an empty box it accepts it and update it but then since a prior trigger of remove was invoked it removes it too
[00:25:11] <easyOnMe> $(ui.draggable).hasClass("sticker")
[00:25:13] <easyOnMe> sorry
[00:25:32] <arc_> that's just in console.debug
[00:25:38] <easyOnMe> arc_: $(this).children(".sticker").length > 0
[00:25:47] <arc_> ok
[00:25:49] <easyOnMe> sorry again
[00:25:51] <arc_> what is the purpose of that
[00:26:05] <arc_> so you can't drop more than one
[00:26:11] <easyOnMe> that will prevent the .boxes to get more than one .sticker
[00:26:14] <easyOnMe> yes
[00:27:55] <arc_> you don't have to do that
[00:28:35] <easyOnMe> arc_: then what is the alternative then
[00:29:13] <arc_> first of all, what is adding the class new supposed to mean
[00:29:18] <arc_> i don't get it
[00:30:46] <arc_> well, the easiest thing to do is add a class to the sticker that you are supposed to be picking up.
[00:30:52] <arc_> and only accept that class, not .sticker
[00:31:12] <arc_> and remove that class from any that have been dropped
[00:34:29] <arc_> nope, that's not true. i should really just figure this out first before i try telling you what to do
[00:44:26] <easyOnMe> arc_: ok
[00:44:30] <easyOnMe> no problem
[00:44:37] <easyOnMe> I will try to do something also on my end
[00:50:10] <AcidRain> hello, what is the selector for form[method="get"] to find all inputs?
[01:01:33] <arc_> easyOnMe idk why it took me so long to think of this. i need sleep
[01:01:50] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/23/
[01:01:52] <arc_> i only changed line 19
[01:02:14] <easyOnMe> arc_: man sorry what is idk
[01:02:33] <arc_> 'i don't know'
[01:02:57] <easyOnMe> arc_: ok man
[01:03:06] <arc_> it works now, anyway
[01:03:13] <easyOnMe> thanks appreciate you effort
[01:03:28] <arc_> just test if the box does NOT have class 'new' before you clone it
[01:04:36] <easyOnMe> arc_: what do you mean
[01:04:40] <easyOnMe> how do I test that
[01:04:50] <easyOnMe> console.debug is the only way to know I think
[01:06:34] <arc_> look at my link
[01:06:40] <arc_> i already updated it to work
[01:06:58] <arc_> line 19 was what needed to be changed
[01:07:05] <easyOnMe> arc_: yeah I am looking at it now
[01:07:09] <easyOnMe> you got is right man
[01:07:09] <easyOnMe> thanks
[01:07:14] <easyOnMe> :)
[01:07:29] <easyOnMe> i was thinking along the same line just did not get the right syntax
[01:07:40] <easyOnMe> now I learned tremendously here
[01:07:45] <easyOnMe> thanks so much
[01:07:48] <arc_> you're welcome
[01:07:52] <easyOnMe> btw where are you from
[01:07:57] <easyOnMe> if you don't mind me asking
[01:08:04] <arc_> a suburb of detroit
[01:08:08] <easyOnMe> oh ok
[01:08:19] <easyOnMe> man I learn a lot these past few days and nights
[01:08:28] <easyOnMe> and you are one of those kind souls who helped me out
[01:08:29] <arc_> you still have one problem though, but it's minor
[01:08:33] <easyOnMe> I will not forget you man
[01:08:39] <easyOnMe> what problem is it
[01:08:57] <easyOnMe> please give me some ideas on how to solve it
[01:09:00] <arc_> if you drag a sticker to a box that contains one, it reverts properly
[01:09:06] <easyOnMe> ok
[01:09:17] <arc_> but after that if you drag a sticker to a box that does not already contain one, it does the revert animation
[01:09:18] <s00pcan_> arc_: novi here
[01:09:29] <arc_> hm?
[01:09:43] <s00pcan_> arc_: I'm saying I live in michigan
[01:09:50] <arc_> oh lol
[01:09:53] <arc_> sorry i'm tired as i've said
[01:09:59] <arc_> i live in clawson
[01:10:09] <s00pcan_> never heard of it
[01:10:21] <arc_> it's near royal oak, troy, madison heights
[01:10:29] <arc_> it's like 1 square mile
[01:10:42] <easyOnMe> arc_: yeah I saw that problem too
[01:10:44] <easyOnMe> but its ok
[01:10:49] <easyOnMe> its really minor
[01:10:50] <arc_> easyOnMe all right
[01:11:02] <arc_> i mean, it's possible to fix it, just have to think about it for a bit
[01:11:03] <s00pcan_> ah south of troy, north of royal oak. ok
[01:11:05] <easyOnMe> what is important here is I met the user requirements
[01:11:21] <arc_> you just have to figure out when to set revert to false
[01:11:52] <arc_> i think, anyway
[01:12:04] <s00pcan_> arc_:  know any place that are hiring around here :D
[01:12:08] <s00pcan_> I'm kind of unemployed :(
[01:12:32] <arc_> seems like micro center is always hiring
[01:12:43] <s00pcan_> eh
[01:12:45] <easyOnMe> arc_: shall we set it to false when $(this).children("." + cssClass).length === 0 then revert:false
[01:12:50] <easyOnMe> will that work
[01:13:02] <s00pcan_> my goal is to get something in ann arbor nexst
[01:13:17] <arc_> ah, well i don't know anything in that area
[01:13:33] <arc_> easyOnMe there's that line again, i have no idea where that came from :p
[01:13:48] <easyOnMe> sorry
[01:13:52] <easyOnMe> I mean this one
[01:14:22] <easyOnMe> $(this).children(".sticker").length === 0
[01:14:45] <arc_> easyOnMe i figured it out. here http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/24/
[01:17:43] <easyOnMe> arc_: wow thanks man
[01:17:48] <easyOnMe> you are soooooooooooooo cool
[01:17:56] <arc_> lol -_-
[01:18:08] <easyOnMe> man how many years did you spend using jquery and jqueryUI
[01:18:24] <arc_> i've never used jqueryui before
[01:18:38] <arc_> the first time i ever tried to do anything with it was yesterday, because you asked for help
[01:19:03] <s00pcan_> I've used the jqueryui sortable thing, probably others.  It's barely worth mentioning
[01:19:06] <arc_> jquery ... i don't know, i've been in this channel for maybe 4-5 months. i just mess around with it when i need to do something
[01:19:15] <s00pcan_> people just ask me to do stuff with it and I do it, not really worth noting
[01:19:47] <arc_> i would say i'm still a beginner, which is why i gave you some wrong information a couple times
[01:19:58] <arc_> there are other people in here who will tell you exactly what to do immediately every time
[01:19:59] <easyOnMe> arc_: same here man
[01:20:01] <easyOnMe> lol
[01:20:19] <s00pcan_> really not much to it, just read the api
[01:21:02] <s00pcan_> job descriptions asking for years with a damn library instead of just pure javascript annoys me
[01:21:17] <s00pcan_> you can learn the library and get with the conventions already in place in the code quick enough
[01:21:44] <arc_> i mean ... yeah you are mostly right, but efficiency still comes with experience
[01:22:01] <arc_> there is something to be said for not having to ever read the api
[01:22:12] <arc_> and knowing about all the quirks and exceptions
[01:22:26] <s00pcan_> do jquery stuff in your browser console.  Most people don't do that for some reason.  way fast than trial-and-error writing code
[01:25:29] <easyOnMe> s00pcan_: I agree with both of you but right now
[01:26:00] <easyOnMe> all I can say is frequent exposure to the code means not only efficiency but also fluency in its usage
[01:26:19] <easyOnMe> this is probably the reason why I do not pick up as much as arc_ does
[01:26:25] <easyOnMe> or you for that matter
[01:26:36] <easyOnMe> I mean I had similar experience with PHP before
[01:26:37] <s00pcan_> I've used jquery enough to know what anti-patterns it leads to in crap codebases
[01:26:48] <s00pcan_> stupid classes-on-elements driving all the logic
[01:27:04] <easyOnMe> I spent sleepless night learning to code and arrive at what I wanted
[01:27:07] <s00pcan_> listener messes
[01:27:16] <easyOnMe> only to realize that my problem is lack of exposure
[01:27:52] <easyOnMe> frequent exposure not only helps with delivering results but enhances the developer's creativity too which leads to better solutions
[01:28:13] <easyOnMe> anyway, I think I really need more exposure with jquery
[01:28:21] <easyOnMe> arc are you always around here
[01:37:54] <arc_> nope
[01:53:51] <easyOnMe> arc_: thanks so much man
[01:53:59] <easyOnMe> really learned a lot from you today

[12:33:05] <z1haze> Hi, I am using a tabbed panel layout for my site, meaning that a user can click the tabs to change the conent in the div, etc.. In one of my tabs I have a chart that displays. For some reason, when the chart is added to a tab that is not displayed when the page loads, the dimensions of the chart get messed up
[12:33:53] <z1haze> for example: proper dimensions http://puu.sh/lU8vS/24f6d2e446.png vs in correct dimensions: http://puu.sh/lU8xU/6ebff3545e.png
[12:34:02] <z1haze> how can I fix this so that the dimensions are correct inside the tabs?
[12:41:36] <z1haze> found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16137467/bad-flot-canvas-chart-size-within-bootstrap-tab-pane-on-initial-page-load which is what my issue is, but theres really not an answer in it, at least not what i figured out
[13:12:15] <z1haze> what do I need to do in order to have access to functions inside of a .click( function() { ?
[13:41:39] <momomo> what is the best/efficient way to escape a string for storing on a html attribute ?

[13:47:22] <Vivekananda> I have code that does this (see pastie)on an html page. When I call it ( at the last line ) according to the flot methods in "Plot methods" of the section in here-- https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md. I get an error. http://pastie.org/10630613
[14:43:39] <z1haze> i need help with getting a flot chart to render properly in a bootstrap tab taht is hidden on load
[14:52:32] <z1haze> or how can you wait for a bootstrap tab to be loaded before doing something
[15:17:08] <z1haze> someone please help me with getting a flot chart drawn correctly in a div thats hidden when the chart is drawn
[15:28:44] <shoky> z1haze make a jsfiddle
[15:31:18] <z1haze> i cant
[15:31:21] <z1haze> its too much shit
[15:31:30] <z1haze> would take me an hour just to make the fiddle
[15:34:38] <shoky> good luck getting help then.
[15:39:36] <flavorfull> hey guys, i want to make a real-time polling graph, but when you c;ick a button it will generate image of graph like png, is there some service that does this?
[16:39:01] <Vivekananda> I am reading through a documentation. https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md . I want to call the plot.setData(newData) after it is assigned a reference (ie a dom element). The problem is that in my code the assignment happens inside a $(function(){} code ie inside a dom.ready code. How do I do this ?
[16:46:56] <compact> hi. i have var qty = (parseInt(row.find('input[name^="chep_pallets"]').val(),10)) + (parseInt(row.find('input[name^="loscam_pallets"]').val(),10));
[16:47:04] <compact> if loscam_pallets is null, qty shows up NaN
[16:47:07] <compact> any idea how I can fix this?
[16:48:20] <compact> ah figured it

[17:49:33] <Audlex> thanx FilipNortic
[18:16:47] <deletemeplease> Thanks to the contributors and developers of JQuery

[19:38:47] <z1haze> how can I pass css as a parameter into a function?
[19:39:23] <z1haze> i have a function that positions a tooltip, sometimes I want it at the bottom, sometimes I want it at the top.. I want to pass as a paramter like bottom: 20, or top: 15
[19:44:34] <shoky> pass an object?
[19:47:59] <porjo> I'm creating a bunch of elements with 'var $newEle = $(html).insertAfter($ele);'. I'd like to remove those element with `setTimeout( function() { $newEle.remove(); },1000 );', however I'm finding only the very last element gets removed...I'm guessing because of variable scope issues. How do I work around that?
[19:59:42] <porjo> ok, I've found this works: 'setTimeout( function() { $(this).remove(); }.bind($newEle),1000 );' - is that the 'best' approach?
[20:07:10] <shoky> porjo i'm guessing this is done inside a for loop where you're setting $newEle in each iteration. the reason only the last one was removed indeed has to do with scope - only functions have their own scope, a for loop's body doesn't
[20:08:13] <shoky> porjo: a preferred approach is to not use a for loop. instead use .forEach or .map (or jquery's .each or .map) which already gives you a new function scope for each iteration
[20:08:39] <porjo> shoky, no, $newEle is created in response to a 'click' action. So if the user clicks multiple times, multiple instances of $newEle are created
[20:08:53] <shoky> porjo: and what is the scope of $newEle ?
[20:09:23] <shoky> porjo: you define it in the click handler or is it in a more global scope?
[20:09:40] <shoky> a jsfiddle would help
[20:10:33] <porjo> shoky, ok - I'll create one
[20:11:08] <shoky> oks. i'll be back in 20-30 min if you'll still need help
[20:14:55] <porjo> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/ea4k7zpj/
[20:15:24] <porjo> That works using bind(), so just wondering if there's a better approach I should use e.g. more browser compatible
[20:33:47] <Audlex> I get a 'aximum call stack size exceeded' from this: http://pastebin.com/dNXnuLXp
[20:34:09] <Audlex> would anyone know why? should that not just loop through once? FYI there is more than one $('.downloadFilter form')
[20:40:44] <Vivekananda> stuck with something hope someone can answer.
[20:44:14] <goldstar> is it possible to get a cookie's path in js?
[20:44:49] <Robdgreat> Vivekananda: I probably can't answer, but if you ask someone will have a chance
[20:44:54] <arc_> there is a jquery cookie library, so yes
[20:45:39] <Vivekananda> I have a dashboard(bought). That loads some graphs on dom.ready. A div gets a flot chart inside dom.ready. A variable "flot_statsChart" declared globally and initialized inside the dom.ready to the <div>. Now I want to update the flot Chart using the plot methods described under "Plot methods" here -- https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md#plot-methods . how do I do it with leveraging the flot initialize function
[20:45:39] <Vivekananda> already present ( ie without completely rewriting it or deleting it ) .
[20:46:16] <goldstar> arc_: link?
[20:47:46] <z1haze> when I create multiple instnaces of a flot chart it gets really choppy and starts messing up
[20:47:53] <z1haze> can anyone look at what i have to see whats up?
[20:48:53] <arc_> goldstar https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[20:49:29] <arc_> so you can either just use that, or look at how it does it, or try to figure it out on mdn
[20:50:25] <goldstar> arc_: that looks like a standard cookie lib to me; does show anything interesting about retreiving the cookie's path,domain, secure flag etc
[20:50:35] <goldstar> s/does/doesn't
[20:51:26] <arc_> actually ... what would it even mean to retreive a cookie's path
[20:51:35] <arc_> you can only address the cookie if you have the path already
[20:51:54] <arc_> if you just give a name, it's not necessarily unique
[20:52:19] <arc_> sorry, i guess i didn't fully think about what you were asking
[20:53:48] <goldstar> arc_: that is asides the point; I am trying to set the secure flag for cookies but not setting the correct date, path, domain, host etc means a seperate cookie is created instead of the cookie being overwritten
[20:54:10] <goldstar> anyway, it looks untenable; the PCI guys won't be happy
[20:56:05] <goldstar> thanks for the help though
[21:00:59] <shoky> porjo: seems to work fine.. http://jsfiddle.net/ea4k7zpj/2/
[21:01:59] <Audlex> any idea why this loop keeps going until it errors out? http://pastebin.com/dNXnuLXp
[21:03:26] <shoky> Audlex: because calling .submit() on the jquery object will re-trigger the submit event. why not just remove that line..?
[21:04:05] <shoky> Audlex: in any case, calling this.submit() directly on the DOM element won't trigger the event.
[21:04:20] <Audlex> ah that makes so much sense!
[21:04:22] <Audlex> thank you shoky
[21:05:48] <porjo> shoky, grrr I'm sure I tested earlier, and it was not working that way!? Anyway, thanks for your help.
[21:07:55] <MikeJoel> could someone look at this and tell me if the pause (between clicking the button and actually getting the data) is normal... http://parksandsonspiano.com/testSite/index.php?page=musicteachers click any of the PHONE links and a window pops up. Enter the word between the { } and click the button. This is the pause to data point I am wondering about...
[21:08:42] <shoky> Vivekananda: var plot = $("#yourPlotElement").data("plot");   plot.setData(...);   etc
[21:10:37] <shoky> Vivekananda: of course, you have to run that _after_ your dashboard code has already initialized flot on that element
[21:11:09] <shoky> Vivekananda: if your code is included after the dashboard code.. might be enough to just put that inside your own dom.ready
[21:12:20] <shoky> Vivekananda: er, or if you can access that global flot_statsChart you mentioned, then you can just use that, in dom.ready i guess
[21:13:47] <Vivekananda> shoky, I didn't quite understand what you said. Could you rephrase please ?
[21:13:55] <shoky> uh. which part?
[21:14:27] <shoky> put your own code in your own dom.ready  is basically what i said
[21:15:58] <shoky> and i also gave you another way to access the flot instance object that has the .setData and other methods you want to call
[21:17:03] <Vivekananda> shoky, yes perhaps but it all got jumbled up. I didn't quite follow the sequence of what you said as you mixed everything up.
[21:17:19] <Vivekananda> let me try to rephrase what you said and correct me
[21:17:28] <shoky> <shoky> put your own code in your own dom.ready  is basically what i said
[21:17:36] <Vivekananda> yeah I got that part
[21:20:07] <garrettw> I'm trying to customize this WP theme called Vantage... for some reason, some of the page elements are animating when they change CSS properties, and I can't figure out why... What should I be looking for in the code that would do something like that?
[21:20:09] <Vivekananda> so suppose there is already a dom.ready on the page. it initializes the flot and also assigns it to plot variable. Now 1. If I make my own dom.ready will it conflict with the other one ?  2. how do I make sure that my dom.ready is accessed after the plot variable has been initialized and not before. 3. How do I make sure that the plot variable initialized in the other dom actually has the div assigned to it ? ( I ask 3 coz
[21:20:09] <Vivekananda> currently I get it as undefined in the console.log when accessing it outside the dom.ready ie in a normal js function).
[21:21:39] <shoky> Vivekananda: no it will not conflict. each dom.ready will run one after the other,  in the same order that they were called. so if your dom.ready code is included after the dashboard's dom.ready code, then your code will be executed after dashboard's, like you want
[21:22:34] <shoky> Vivekananda: about 3. if it is really global then you'll be able to access it , if you try to access it at the right time (i.e. in dom.ready that was included after the dashboard's)
[21:22:59] <Vivekananda> ok so 1 down. for 2. are the variables available in dom.ready 2 with the values they got in dom.ready1 ?
[21:23:03] <shoky> if it's not really global then you can try to use the other way i showed at first  var plot = $("#yourPlotElementDiv").data("plot");
[21:23:59] <Vivekananda> shoky, it is global coz it is declared as (var flot_charts) outside of all functions but inside <script></script> on the page. ( assuming that will make it global)
[21:24:04] <shoky> it depends on the scope of those variables. if they are defined inside the dom.ready  (var flot_statsChart = ...;  is inside the dom.ready)   then the scope is only that dom.ready
[21:24:23] <Vivekananda> okay got that so I think it is global.
[21:24:26] <shoky> so yeah if it's outside all functions then it's global
[21:24:42] <shoky> and you can access anything global, from anywhere. that's what it means ;)
[21:24:48] <shoky> but the timing has to be right
[21:24:56] <shoky> you can't access it before it's been defined.
[21:25:09] <Vivekananda> so 3 down. how about 2-followup I asked above -- ok so 1 down. for 2. are the variables available in dom.ready 2 with the values they got in dom.ready1 ?
[21:25:19] <shoky> that's what i just answered..
[21:25:30] <shoky> it depends on the scope.
[21:25:32] <Vivekananda> but I can actually test this one :) thanks shoky
[21:25:49] <Vivekananda> let me try some testing too :)
[21:26:21] <shoky> for testing you can also put a console.log  in each of the dom.ready  and see exactly the order they are run in
[21:26:27] <shoky> if you're curious about that ;p
[21:29:25] <shoky> garrettw: it could be in the CSS itself, sounds maybe like css transitions
[21:30:19] <garrettw> well when I say animate, i'm talking about something moving positions
[21:30:33] <shoky> yup.
[21:30:39] <garrettw> hmmm ok
[21:31:02] <garrettw> I don't think I saw anything like that when I inspected the element, but i'll look again
[21:32:57] <shoky> garrettw: donno if this is what you're using but ther's lotsa transitions here  https://wp-themes.com/wp-content/themes/vantage/style.css?ver=1.4.4
[21:33:11] <Vivekananda> yes trying that
[21:33:25] <shoky> well, some transitions
[21:34:05] <garrettw> ohhh yeah forgot about all the transitions -_- just shoot me now
[21:47:03] <Vivekananda> shoky, here is a sample code of what is happening. I get undefined on line 16. wonder why -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/81d5a74b0636ef6dc308
[21:52:10] <Vivekananda> ok so I tested with console.logs. So quite interestingly the code on 16 gets executed Before line 11. interesting. Can someone tell me why ?
[21:54:01] <Vivekananda> okay here is a better gist with outputs .
[21:55:59] <Vivekananda> sorry nevermind so yeah line 11 gets executed after line 16 . Can someone tell me why  ? https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/81d5a74b0636ef6dc308
[21:58:39] <shoky> Vivekananda sec
[22:01:19] <shoky> Vivekananda:  you're doing  .data("")  that always returns undefined..
[22:03:21] <shoky> Vivekananda: and no, line 11 doesn't get executed after line 16..  http://jsfiddle.net/ofavrmnx/
[22:12:18] <Vivekananda> shoky, I can show you the whole thing ( you wont like it coz it is big) but in my case b is coming before a :( on the live demo in the console
[22:15:29] <shoky> Vivekananda show the whole thing... i'll take a quick look, tho going to bed in a bit
[22:15:51] <shoky> so be quick ;p
[22:17:30] <Vivekananda> shoky, okay
[22:17:33] <Vivekananda> here
[22:17:44] <Vivekananda> http://c3d977cd.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/Developer/AJAX_version/#ajax/dashboard.html
[22:18:07] <Vivekananda> see the console output
[22:19:53] <Vivekananda> shit the page script is not visible :(
[22:20:06] <Vivekananda> if you want I can show the whole page source pasted too
[22:20:40] <Vivekananda> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/c0562c365aa337188280 -- shoky
[22:23:00] <shoky> Vivekananda: which file is your code in
[22:23:14] <shoky> really annoying with that loadScript thing..
[22:23:26] <shoky> can't debug properly :\
[22:24:26] <Vivekananda> the code is in dashboard.html
[22:24:52] <Vivekananda> but the index.html loads and pulls in the dashboard.html inside it
[22:24:58] <Vivekananda> I pasted the current code above in the gist
[22:27:19] <shoky> Vivekananda: it's not loading anymore..
[22:27:26] <shoky> Vivekananda: Internal Server Error
[22:30:19] <Vivekananda> shit one sec
[22:30:25] <Vivekananda> just adding console.log
[22:30:43] <Vivekananda> please try again
[22:30:46] <Vivekananda> now
[22:34:04] <Vivekananda> I probably see the problem there. the loadscript have a call back to a function (generateGraphs) which in turn has my flot steps inside. This generate.. function is getting delayed and instead the other dom ready is getting called !!
[22:34:53] <Vivekananda> shoky, ^^.
[22:37:35] <Vivekananda> so the current sequence is loadscript(callback funct x) --> ready(2) --> funct(x)-> ready(1)--> assign value. But to work it has to be loadscript(callback funct x) --> funct(x) --> ready(1) --> assignvalue --> ready(2)
[22:38:53] <shoky> Vivekananda: yea so the generateGraphs is only called when the loadScript stuff is done, which is probably after the dom is ready, so your own dom.ready already runs before then
[22:40:12] <shoky> Vivekananda: so.. i don't see a way, without modifying their code, to know when they are done so you can then run your own code. sorry ;]
[22:41:04] <Vivekananda> yeah I understand and thanks for looking at this.
[22:41:11] <Vivekananda> btw shoky a quick thing
[22:41:55] <Vivekananda> here is what their loadscript looks like. Could this be hindering things or blocking further actions https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/214e7a95442214559566
[22:42:08] <Vivekananda> it looks harmless enough ie non blocking
[22:42:18] <Vivekananda> why would it stall the first ready
[22:42:45] <shoky> it just takes time, and it's loading the scripts sequentially (one after the other)
[22:43:20] <Vivekananda> so is there a jquery way to execute step 2 after i make sure step 1 is finished ?
[22:43:28] <Vivekananda> a callback I guess right ?
[22:43:34] <shoky> yes but not without modifying their code ;]
[22:44:04] <shoky> a callback would work, yes. but you have to modify their code to make it accept a callback , for example
[22:44:12] <Vivekananda> shoky, I will have to modify their code. Just that I want to do it in the least invasive way. so if I can place a call back and then define my own callback elsewhere that would solve the issue
[22:44:27] <Vivekananda> right ?
[22:44:29] <shoky> yea you can do that then
[22:44:45] <shoky> good luck ;]  am going to bed. gnight
[22:44:46] <Vivekananda> one more thing
[22:45:27] <Vivekananda> do I have to define the call back in the outermost function or can I do it just before loadscript or perhaps in the nested actual function ? I guess it will be in the outermost right ?
[22:46:49] <shoky> you can do it on the "pagefunction" function
[22:48:10] <shoky> bye
[22:53:46] <sinepregginkcuf> why is jquery for fags?
[22:54:12] <sinepregginkcuf> i was speaking to someone at a conference and they said that jquery is for fags
[23:59:21] <z1haze> anyone whos used highcharts before, how do you apply 2 data sets to the same chart using a pointStat, pointinterval
[23:59:43] <z1haze> when my graph draws it draws basically 2 half size full graphs rather than the 2 overlaid
