[01:23:54] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to show an alert on marker drag in google maps api, but I not get results. Anyone can help me please? http://jsfiddle.net/xu2gsjcz/7/
[01:55:58] <quackgyver> I just wanted the slider component of the jQuery UI, so I selected it + everything depending on it and nothing else, but when I check the index.html of the downloaded package it says "This page demonstrates the widgets and theme you selected in Download Builder" and I'm not seeing any examlpes.
[01:56:00] <quackgyver> examples*
[01:56:22] <quackgyver> It just says "YOUR COMPONENTS: Framework Icons (content color preview) Slider Highlight / Error Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style."
[01:56:23] <quackgyver> in plaintext
[01:56:27] <quackgyver> this is really confusing
[01:56:35] <quackgyver> I've never used jQ UI before.
[01:56:41] <quackgyver> And yeah, this seems weird.
[01:57:57] <quackgyver> also it gives me the option to select a "theme"
[01:58:01] <quackgyver> what does that even mean
[01:59:40] <Cork> quackgyver: that page is for the theme
[01:59:51] <Cork> go to the demo page if you want to know how to use it
[02:00:03] <quackgyver> So it's supposed to be in plaintext?
[02:00:19] <Cork> plaintext?
[02:00:28] <quackgyver> quackgyver> It just says "YOUR COMPONENTS: Framework Icons (content color preview) Slider Highlight / Error Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style."
[02:00:28] <quackgyver> 10:56:25 <quackgyver> in plaintext
[02:00:49] <Cork> not sure what you mean by that
[02:01:09] <quackgyver> "when I check the index.html of the downloaded package it says "This page demonstrates the widgets and theme you selected in Download Builder" and I'm not seeing any examlpes."
[02:01:16] <quackgyver>  It just says "YOUR COMPONENTS: Framework Icons (content color preview) Slider Highlight / Error Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style."
[02:01:22] <quackgyver> " in plaintext"
[02:01:29] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[02:02:26] <quackgyver> Yes I know of that page. What I'm asking is whether it sounds normal that the index.html-page that comes with the package packaged by jQuery's download manager is in plaintext.
[02:02:35] <quackgyver> because i can't make any sense of it
[02:02:56] <Cork> if the files you need is there what does it matteR?
[02:02:58] <quackgyver> again it just says "YOUR COMPONENTS: Framework Icons (content color preview) Slider Highlight / Error Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style." in plaintext
[02:03:19] <quackgyver> It matters because I don't do black box development where I just download shit and put it live if it seems like it might work.
[02:03:25] <quackgyver> If something looks weird I'll get to the bottom of it.
[02:03:34] <quackgyver> And I'll try to understand it.
[02:03:50] <Cork> ya, so do it by reading the example pages and documentation
[02:03:59] <Cork> not some random file
[02:04:15] <quackgyver> ...it's not a random file. It's a package packaged by the official download manager.
[02:04:24] <quackgyver> Man, why are people on IRC so stupid.
[02:04:31] <quackgyver> It's like their reading comprehension is zero.
[02:04:36] <Cork> ya, a package with the css and js files you need
[02:04:40] <quackgyver> Ignored.
[02:04:41] <Cork> it is not a complete ide
[02:06:36] <quackgyver> If anyone knows what might cause jQuery UI's download builder/manager ( http://jqueryui.com/download/ ) to give you a plaintext index.html in its package (alongside other files), let me know.
[02:06:55] <quackgyver> Because for me it just says "YOUR COMPONENTS: Framework Icons (content color preview) Slider Highlight / Error Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style." in plaintext, and it looks like it should be styled or something.
[02:07:04] <quackgyver> Or at least show me examples of the components that I've downloaded?
[02:07:07] <quackgyver> Or is this just normal?
[02:07:43] <Cork> the download page gives you the source files you need to user the widget
[02:07:58] <Cork> if you want to know how to use it read the documentation on the site
[02:18:02] <mikecmpbll> i stumbled across a jquery lib a while back which make it easy to do these "callout" type tips for forms and page elements, almost like a walkthrough
[02:18:11] <mikecmpbll> can't find it for shit now. really frustrating.
[02:18:23] <mikecmpbll> appreciate any suggestions :d.
[02:21:14] <YamakasY> hi guys!
[02:21:54] <YamakasY> I´m having trouble with some jquery fileuploader that actually works well using PHP but uploads my images as .error
[02:22:56] <zeroquake> "It matters because I don't do black box development where I just download shit and put it live if it seems like it might work."
[02:23:18] <zeroquake> am really curious if you have people using your sw
[02:23:25] <zeroquake> software*
[02:23:56] <YamakasY> ?
[02:24:13] <zeroquake> oh sorry was refering to quackgyver
[02:24:17] <YamakasY> okay
[02:24:27] <Cork> YamakasY: its a continuation on an old discussion
[02:24:38] <quackgyver> zeroquake: Yes I do, why
[02:24:42] <Cork> (from before you joined)
[02:25:03] <zeroquake> not you ...i mean actually consumers for your product
[02:25:06] <YamakasY> Cork, okay :) I´m just debugging a windows dev machines with my linux prod env... so the answer was kinda like it came to me :)
[02:25:16] <quackgyver> zeroquake: Yes, I do have consumers.
[02:25:18] <quackgyver> Why
[02:25:22] <zeroquake> how many ?
[02:25:26] <quackgyver> Idk
[02:25:31] <quackgyver> 30-200 per project
[02:25:38] <zeroquake> maybe you should take a count
[02:25:46] <quackgyver> It varies.
[02:25:56] <quackgyver> Maybe if you tell me why you're asking I could give a better answer
[02:26:05] <YamakasY> someone using this plugin ? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[02:26:26] <zeroquake> the above statement i posted -- That problem is biggest and most well know reason for products to fail
[02:26:45] <quackgyver> What do you mean
[02:27:15] <zeroquake> nevarmind - if it works for you , it is good enough
[02:27:24] <quackgyver> Well, I'm confused but alright. :P
[02:27:36] <mikecmpbll> i've fouuuuund it. http://easelinc.github.io/tourist/
[02:28:41] <zeroquake> Next time you take an interview , client call , buisness meeting etc -- mention the statement i posted above , if you get a job or a deal from a client after hearing that .I thnk i am gonna leave my job and come work for you
[02:28:54] <quackgyver> what statement?
[02:29:06] <zeroquake>  I don't do black box development where I just download shit and put it live if it seems like it might work
[02:29:14] <quackgyver> What's weird about that
[02:29:44] <zeroquake> nevarmind.
[02:31:12] <quackgyver> I'd say it's a good idea to try to get to the bottom of things that look broken rather than implementing it as-is. From my experience lazy and sloppy developers create problems that cost people a lot of time and money, whereas developers who are attentive to details and like to try to understand things are good at perceiving problems so that they can be
[02:31:12] <quackgyver> nipped before it's too late.
[02:31:43] <quackgyver> People who say "WHY DO YOU CARE IT WORKS???" are just stupid.
[02:32:07] <YamakasY> guys, stop such useless conversations
[02:32:10] <mikecmpbll> ^lol
[02:36:28] <zeroquake> i myt be drunk on coffee , you do realize the last three statements you said pretty much apply to you right !?
[02:36:44] <YamakasY> is someone willing to look at the https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload at which part a filename getś .error instead of .jpg or so ?
[02:37:08] <YamakasY> Iḿ having issues on a linux box which should run the app, on our windows dev it works OK
[02:38:01] <YamakasY> I get the feeling it´s at the chunked file part
[02:38:14] <Uhkis> upload directory permissions?
[02:39:40] <YamakasY> yeah that might be but it uploads OK
[02:39:49] <jmdrawneek> JS noob question. I have a set of variables that all get passed one by one to a function. Would it be better to have them listed and some kind of loop to pass each one or am I just making it more complicated?
[02:39:49] <YamakasY> but as .error
[02:39:51] <quackgyver> zeroquake: How?
[02:40:27] <YamakasY> Uhkis, I use 761 for the directory which is www-data:www-data
[02:42:45] <Soelen> hello everyone, I have an odd issue on my side...
[02:43:18] <Soelen> so I am having a slideDown/slideUp animation, on the netbook it is being animated as it should be and on the pc it simply skips the animation, what the heck?
[02:43:46] <Soelen> I have no explanation for this behaviour, they are sharing the same code basis, has anyone ever experienced this?
[02:44:10] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: Browsers?
[02:45:08] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: As in which browsers are you using? Have you checked its being called on both?
[02:46:02] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: same browsers, firefox developer version, 36.0a2 (2015-01-12) and same os, xubuntu 14.04 64 bit
[02:46:17] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: yes
[02:46:47] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: I am literally running the same browser software on both systems
[02:47:22] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: what do you mean with checked if its being called on both? The slideDown animation? How do I check such a thing?
[02:47:30] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: Have you checked its being fired with break points?
[02:47:46] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: Using something like firebug?
[02:47:55] <abailarri> How is posible to count the results of an ajax response? My ajax returns 8 objects and I want to alert number 8
[02:48:15] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: oh, as in debugging with the browser? Never did this before
[02:48:59] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: Well this is the situation to start learning
[02:49:49] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: I have a theory
[02:50:27] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: You need to figure out if its being called. As in is the script being included. Then check with breakpoints that its being called/fired when you click your trigger
[02:51:01] <jmdrawneek> Solemn: Theory aren't much use tbh. Debugging logically is
[02:51:10] <jmdrawneek> *Theories
[02:51:47] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: hear me out please, so I know that firefox disables hardware acceleration for intel hd chips. So I am assuming firefox is rendering this animation in a different technique then it would do on hardware accelration. Chromium has a bigger hardware accelration support, I just tested chromium on both systems and it doesn't animate as well
[02:51:54] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: is this theory plausible?
[02:52:45] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: well you can't debug a rendering engine to its core with just web developer tools . P
[02:52:48] <Soelen> : P
[02:53:43] <Cork> Soelen: browsers blacklist hardware not cause the browser isn't compatible but cause either the driver crashes or the performance is worse then the cpu path
[02:53:58] <jmdrawneek> Soelen: Highly doubt hardware acceleration would be used for slide
[02:54:45] <Cork> no slideUp/Down changes the elements height
[02:54:52] <Cork> that isn't cpu accelerated
[02:55:11] <Cork> (can't really be)
[02:56:15] <Soelen> well, I'm not the expert here hehe
[02:56:55] <Soelen> thank you for your input, guess this leaves me with some sort of debugging
[02:57:37] <Cork> Soelen: slideUp/Down works by doing height adjustment to the element in a timered loop
[02:58:00] <Cork> if the cpu gets busy the tick can be delayed enough to not get any ticks at all in the animation loop
[02:58:08] <Cork> and that is why you don't see any animations
[02:58:24] <Cork> Soelen: what you can do is try using requestAnimationFrame
[02:58:40] <Cork> as it is triggered by the browser before it draws the element
[02:58:47] <Cork> so you can do much better animations with it
[02:59:04] <Soelen> Cork: how exactly should I call requestAnimationFrame?
[02:59:07] <Cork> (jquery doesn't use it cause of too many broken slideshow plugins)
[02:59:17] <Cork> ?g mdn requestAnimationFrame
[02:59:18] <b-ot> Cork: Window.requestAnimationFrame() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[02:59:30] <Soelen> I mean in combinatoin with slideUp/slideDown
[02:59:53] <Cork> you don't
[03:00:03] <Soelen> I see
[03:00:04] <Cork> well you could patch jquery
[03:00:28] <Cork> https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-requestAnimationFrame
[03:00:50] <Cork> ah, he has converted it to a plugin, nice
[03:02:06] <Soelen> Cork: thank you!
[03:02:17] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Do you know of a good pure JS channel I can ask questions about logic/loops etc?
[03:02:21] <wodim> hello, from my .js file i want to import another .js file and exec some code when it's loaded. (i can't modify that js file) how would i proceed?
[03:05:49] <FinStick> wodim: have you tried google?
[03:06:02] <wodim> FinStick: no, now i did. thanks.
[03:06:03] <wodim> : - )
[03:07:40] <Cork> jmdrawneek: ##javascript
[03:08:04] <Cork> jmdrawneek: though as long as it doesn't stray too far from jquery you can ask it here
[03:08:24] <Cork> wodim: js doens't have files
[03:08:32] <Cork> so you don't do it like that
[03:08:46] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Thanks - there are so many different channel its hard to know which to join
[03:08:47] <wodim> Cork: i don't get your point. $.getScript() is what i needed.
[03:09:12] <Cork> wodim: what i mean is you have a resource where you have script this gets loaded and executed
[03:09:16] <Cork> you don't have files
[03:09:24] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Is this too far away? I have a set of variables that all get passed one by one to a function separately. Would it be better to have them listed and some kind of loop to pass each one or am I just making it more complicated?
[03:09:33] <Cork> after you've loaded it is in the big "blob" execution in js
[03:10:04] <Cork> ?paste @ jmd
[03:10:04] <b-ot> jmd: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:10:18] <Cork> gah.. forgot to tab -_-'
[03:10:28] <FinStick> Cork: a js file is a file
[03:10:34] <Cork> FinStick: no it isn't
[03:10:38] <Cork> not to the js endine
[03:10:42] <Cork> *engine
[03:10:52] <Cork> it is to the web server
[03:10:58] <Cork> but not to the browser or the engine
[03:11:18] <FinStick> Cork: what is it to the browser?
[03:11:26] <Cork> its a stream of data
[03:11:32] <Cork> identified by a content-type
[03:11:39] <jmdrawneek> http://pastebin.com/RFddF3GQ
[03:11:51] <Cork> that content is then handed to the engine to be executed in the js context
[03:12:09] <FinStick> Cork: That's like saying a PHP file is not a file to the browser. What point you trying to make?
[03:12:12] <Cork> after that you don't have any separation from any other resource
[03:12:26] <jmdrawneek> I'm trying to write neater/shorter js and practice loops/logic
[03:12:33] <Cork> FinStick: for example in php you can have a variable local to a .php file
[03:12:36] <Cork> you can't in js
[03:12:51] <Cork> all js cares about is scope
[03:13:25] <Cork> jmdrawneek: please use one of the pbs listed by b-ot
[03:13:30] <Cork> preferably jsfiddle
[03:13:36] <FinStick> Cork: and how does js treat scope?
[03:13:53] <Cork> you have function scope and block scope (in es6+)
[03:14:01] <Cork> a function scope is (function() {})()
[03:14:21] <Cork> if you don't scope the code it runs in global scope
[03:14:30] <Cork> meaning accessable to any code anywhere
[03:14:31] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Sorry! http://jsfiddle.net/n1nsnL22/
[03:15:03] <Cork> jmdrawneek: you could merge all the $(function() {})s into one
[03:15:15] <Cork> no need to bind a ready callback for each one
[03:15:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/n1nsnL22/1/
[03:15:30] <Soelen> jmdrawneek: ah, I found the issue, I replaced the html code in some cases and this somewhat causes not to animate
[03:15:44] <Cork> jmdrawneek: also you could combine the selectors
[03:16:14] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Ah so you can just separate them with ,
[03:16:20] <Cork> yes
[03:17:02] <FinStick> Cork: If you do not include the js file that contains "code in global space" it will not see the light of day.
[03:17:16] <Cork> jmdrawneek: or for readability http://jsfiddle.net/n1nsnL22/2/
[03:17:38] <Cork> FinStick: you don't include a file you include a resource(url)
[03:17:48] <Cork> and that is for the html parser NOT the js engine
[03:17:52] <jmdrawneek> Cork: I couldnt see that anywhere in the doc. I know some function expect multiple selections/var separated like that
[03:18:02] <jmdrawneek> Is there a general rule?
[03:18:03] <Cork> the js engine don't know anything about that
[03:18:42] <Cork> jmdrawneek: there no function in core jquery expects multiple selectors
[03:19:04] <Cork> jmdrawneek: what the /2 does is create an array and then joins them with ',' inbetween
[03:19:12] <Cork> it results in one long selector
[03:19:17] <Cork> it just makes it easier to read
[03:19:35] <Cork> (as you can't really linebreak a solid string)
[03:19:43] <FinStick> Cork: How far you want to break it down? That's like saying the CPU will take a file only binary code.
[03:19:51] <Cork> ...
[03:19:55] <FinStick> *wil not
[03:20:08] <FinStick> Keyboard Gremlins
[03:20:09] <Cork> FinStick: firstly files is something you can seek and read from
[03:20:14] <Cork> the web don't have that
[03:20:17] <Cork> it has resources
[03:20:42] <Cork> its a sectioned blob of data you parse as you get it
[03:20:48] <Cork> it has no types in it self
[03:21:11] <Cork> the webserver then tells you what data it will be sending you by the content-type header
[03:21:32] <Cork> FinStick: and again when the content has been loaded into js there is absolutely zero separation in js
[03:21:41] <Cork> THAT is why i say you don't have files in js
[03:21:45] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Ah! I didnt realise that about jQuery - very useful. Thanks for the pointers.
[03:21:52] <jmdrawneek> Cork++
[03:21:53] <Cork> cause you don't have files/resource separation
[03:22:14] <Cork> jmdrawneek: the array thing isn't jquery just normal js tricks to makes cleaner code :)
[03:22:17] <FinStick> Cork: Right.
[03:22:19] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Any recommendations for good reads on jQuery (or even js)
[03:22:40] <Cork> jmdrawneek: there is a bunch of get started sites for jquery
[03:22:42] <FinStick> Cork: In any case you know what the OP was after.
[03:22:43] <Cork> just google it
[03:23:02] <Cork> the op?
[03:23:09] <FinStick> original post
[03:23:16] <FinStick> the person who asked the question
[03:23:22] <Cork> FinStick: well parts of what he asked for isn't possible
[03:23:53] <FinStick> Cork: which part isn't possible?
[03:24:14] <Cork> sigh this is getting tiresome
[03:24:29] <Cork> FinStick: the part about handing it as a file you can change
[03:25:32] <FinStick> Cork: He found the function that did the impossible.
[03:25:53] <Cork> no if found the function to request and execute a resource
[03:26:03] <Cork> gah i don't have the strength for this argument
[03:26:22] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Yea I've read a few bits and bob but they tend to be reference rather than technique. If that makes sense
[03:27:19] <Cork> jmdrawneek: the only real advice i can give you is to not look too much as stack overflow for good techniques
[03:27:35] <FinStick> Cork: Like i said you knew what he meant ;)
[03:27:36] <Cork> cause it has more really bad advice then good ones
[03:28:18] <Cork> FinStick: if you don't want to learn fine, but stop pestering me about it
[03:28:55] <FinStick> Cork: Yes I want to learn the technical details as you have done.
[03:29:14] <Cork> you have a very poor way of showing it...
[03:30:05] <FinStick> Cork: Questioning isn't a poor way.
[03:30:36] <Cork> you didn't question you claimed the statements are wrong
[03:30:49] <Cork> and wanted a freaking debate
[03:30:53] <FinStick> Cork: what statements?
[03:38:25] <FinStick> Cork: Technically it's how you write your js code as to how things are treated. You can write such code to show file separation if you wanted.
[03:44:08] <Xatenev> I think SO is really good to find some start into how your problem can be solved. solving it in a good way is something you should think about yourself :]
[03:44:33] <Xatenev> (Probably nobody cares about my opinion though. Just wanted to contribute a bit) :D
[03:48:01] <FinStick> Xatenev: Who you talking to?
[03:48:24] <Xatenev> "(12:27:20) Cork: jmdrawneek: the only real advice i can give you is to not look too much as stack overflow for good techniques"
[03:48:27] <Xatenev> :)
[03:49:16] <cbuchler> Can somebody explain me the difference between the following events in a jQueryUI Sortable, "receive", "change", "update"? I don't understand how they differ.
[03:50:37] <FinStick> cbuchler: You serious? the name says it all.
[03:52:04] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive
[03:52:07] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-change
[03:52:15] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[03:53:33] <cbuchler> Cork: I read those before I came here. What I do not understand is, when I move an item in a list around is, I should use receive and when it stays in the same list I can actually use update in order to update its position?
[03:54:22] <Cork> cbuchler: change ~ like mousemove
[03:54:27] <Cork> and update is like mouseup
[03:54:35] <cbuchler> Ah :D
[03:54:41] <cbuchler> Thanks Cork!
[03:55:07] <Cork> receive fires when the element is connecting to a new list
[03:55:10] <Cork> but just as it connects
[04:04:51] <mmealling> I'm trying to use blueimp's jquery-file-upload and I can't seem to get it to send the file and form data using AJAX. It always seems to do a new page load on the POST url of the url configured in the fileupload options.
[04:20:07] <Katharsis> do you know any (free to use) TimeRange widget based on jquery?
[04:23:07] <Cork> Katharsis: just google timepicker
[04:23:15] <Cork> you should find a bunch
[04:23:27] <Cork> opps i meant jquery timepicker
[04:26:09] <Katharsis> Cork: http://jonthornton.github.io/jquery-timepicker/ -> Datepair Plugin Example awesome
[04:27:35] <Uhkis> ?api prop
[04:27:35] <b-ot> Uhkis: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[04:28:57] <Cork> Katharsis: quite nice ya
[04:29:41] <Cork> Katharsis: also note there are input of type datetime/date/time
[04:29:50] <Cork> though the support isn't very good yet
[04:29:57] <Cork> but it might be nice for the future

[04:43:45] <Omar-> hello everyone!
[04:47:46] <cambazz> hello, when using jquery validate, with .validate() how can i run something when the form is valid?
[04:48:02] <cambazz> i want to do the nifty trick of enabling disabling submit button
[04:51:14] <Omar-> cambazz use "success" callback
[04:51:54] <Omar-> $("form").validate({ success: function(foo) { $(button).enable(); } });
[05:05:57] <cambazz> Omar- : well, i tried that but it will run even if one field is valid in one form, and inside success i can not reach form.valid()
[05:06:03] <cambazz> i need to check if entire form is valid
[06:32:19] <mikehaas763> I am structuring my JS in a way where the dom elements are decoupled and passed in to my "modules" from each separate view/page. I was preselecting the elements (like $('.my-selector')) and passing those in to my function. I noticed at one point that a dom element doesn't exist yet because it's created within the module. Do others just always use the raw string selector to pass to a function?
[06:34:15] <Cork> mikehaas763: if the element doesn't exist yet a selector is the only thing you can pass
[06:35:05] <mikehaas763> Cork, right which is what I did to fix it. Seems odd to me to have a mixture of string selectors and jquery objects passed in so I was wondering if most people just use selectors only
[06:35:42] <mikehaas763> Cork, my modules have a function with this signature: initialize(elements);
[06:35:44] <Cork> mikehaas763: a mixture is fine as long as it has a structure to it for when you use one or the other
[06:36:18] <mikehaas763> I'm just trying to keep the API to the modules that I create as simple and easy to understand for others as possible
[06:36:30] <Cork> but the question is very generic so it is hard to answer it
[06:36:40] <Cork> might be fine, might not be
[06:36:51] <Cork> might be the function runs too early
[06:36:56] <Cork> or that it should chain or...
[06:37:03] <Cork> can't tell without context
[06:38:39] <Cork> mikehaas763: the better api might be to structure it around $.fn.func and $.func
[06:38:54] <Cork> but again hard to tell
[06:42:28] <bobbobbins> hey, I’m using datatables and I want to override the page function(or just the previous and next buttons), any idea how to accomplish this? I found this, which works in the fiddle, but it doesn’t seem to work on my page: http://jsfiddle.net/6frQZ/3/
[06:44:09] <bobbobbins> it’ll actually run the on click that I put on there, but the paging event still fires
[06:44:57] <BillCriswell> bobbobbins: Do you just not want the paging?
[06:45:14] <bobbobbins> BillCriswell: No, i need the paging…i’m adding some data validation
[06:54:09] <ExtraSteve> If I do $("#mydiv").click(named_function); and then a while later bind the SAME named_function to #mydiv.click() will it execute twice when I click that div?
[06:54:28] <ExtraSteve> Or is it smart enough to only let that happen once?
[06:55:09] <Cork> ExtraSteve: yes
[06:55:13] <Cork> :)
[06:55:20] <ExtraSteve> Thanks
[06:55:21] <ExtraSteve> Wait
[06:55:23] <ExtraSteve> Yes to what?
[06:55:24] <Cork> lol
[06:55:35] <Cork> each event handler is executed when the event fires
[06:55:54] <ExtraSteve> So if I bind it multiple times it's gonna execute multiple times?
[06:55:59] <Cork> so if you bind it three times it will fire three times
[06:55:59] <ExtraSteve> Bah
[06:56:08] <bobbobbins> i wouldn’t say its smart enough to do it once, i’d say its smart enough to create 2 separate events
[06:56:17] <Cork> ExtraSteve: use delegated event handlers if you dynamically add element
[06:56:28] <ExtraSteve> How do you mean?
[06:56:29] <Cork> or if you have multiple elements with the same handler code
[06:56:41] <Cork> ?g jquery delegate
[06:56:43] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:56:47] <ExtraSteve> Thanks :)
[06:56:49] <Cork> read that page
[06:56:49] * ExtraSteve reads
[06:57:29] <Cork> note .on is a "catch all" function used for all event handling in later jqeury versions
[06:57:51] <Cork> just make sure to read up on what triggers what behavior
[06:57:59] <ExtraSteve> mkay
[06:58:33] <ExtraSteve> Essentially I've got a page that updates via ajax and adds elements to the page. I want those new elements to have a .click event
[06:58:50] <ExtraSteve> But I don't want to add extra click events to old/existing elements
[06:58:53] <Cork> bind a delegated event handler to the static parent
[06:59:05] <Cork> and have it handle all the different elements matching a selector
[06:59:09] <ExtraSteve> Perfect :D
[06:59:16] <Cork> makes for more efficient code, and future catching
[06:59:19] <Cork> so you don't have to rebind it
[06:59:22] <ExtraSteve> Yeah, absolutely
[06:59:28] <ExtraSteve> I was hoping there would be something like this
[06:59:32] <ExtraSteve> Thanks Cork!
[07:15:49] <cambazz> .quıt
[07:22:46] <PigDude_> in a cruel twist of fate i'm using jquery ui on this project. how do i add a css class to a jquery ui widget?
[07:23:20] <PigDude_> the autocomplete widget creates elements at a different part of the document, so a classname on the element to which the autocomplete is bound is not useful.
[07:23:40] <gtristan> PigDude_, my guess would be with jquery no ?
[07:24:03] <gtristan> like $(element).addClass ('foo') ?
[07:24:08] <PigDude_> gtristan: i'd hoped there would be a way via the widget API
[07:24:24] <gtristan> maybe there is then... disregard me :)
[07:24:41] <PigDude_> gtristan: particularly seeing that autocomplete defines elements in a different part of the document from the source element, so adding a class to the source element won't do what i want
[07:24:58] <PigDude_> (it is doing document.body.appendChild thing)
[07:25:32] <PigDude_> ok thank you gtristan
[07:25:59] <gtristan> sorry I really don't know about jqueryui, it could be anything :-/
[07:26:11] <PigDude_> that's OK, i searched for a specific channel but didn't find it
[07:26:14] <Cork> gtristan: why would jqueryui add an extra api when jquery already provides one
[07:26:20] <Cork> opps
[07:26:26] <Cork> PigDude_: ^
[07:26:27] <gtristan> Cork, yeah that was my guess
[07:26:55] <PigDude_> Cork: good question. it seems the right way to do this is to call options.widget().jqueryMethod(...)
[07:27:08] <Cork> PigDude_: if you want to add a class to the widget you do .<jqui-plugin>('widget').addClass()
[07:27:10] <PigDude_> Cork: silly me for finding this "surprising"
[07:27:16] <PigDude_> Cork: :)
[07:27:32] <PigDude_> Best API mutates its config
[07:27:37] <Cork> ex .dialog('widget').addClass('my-special-clas')
[07:27:54] <Cork> widget is a nifty function call in jqui
[07:28:00] <Cork> makes extending it much simpler
[07:28:16] <PigDude_> Cork: jquery ui is so totally different from other widgets frameworks so i am getting used to it :)
[07:28:29] <PigDude_> Cork: i am used to conventional (normal, to me) APIs like goog.ui and ExtJS
[07:28:34] <Cork> PigDude_: it is closer to how core jquery works
[07:28:46] <Cork> so it is quite a good model to look at
[07:28:59] <Cork> and it is very easy to extend
[07:29:05] <Cork> and that makes it quite unique too
[07:29:18] <Cork> PigDude_: extjs is hell to extend though
[07:29:21] <PigDude_> not sure how i feel about method dispatch based on string argument, but all good.
[07:29:27] <Cork> i really don't like extjs at all
[07:29:56] <Cork> PigDude_: what do you think about obj['ref']() ?
[07:30:01] <Cork> it is basically the same thing
[07:30:11] <Cork> vs obj.ref()
[07:30:26] <Cork> the notation already exist in js so...
[07:37:56] <cjohnson> obj('ref') is totally different tho
[07:38:09] <cjohnson> which is how a lot of jquery things work
[07:43:44] <reynierpm> hi why itemsArr is empty in this code http://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/uxp8qfc0/ ? why pairs is never pushed to the Array?
[07:44:10] <ExtraSteve> Cork: .on worked beautifully, by the way. Thanks again :)
[07:46:13] <PigDude_> Cork: it *is* the same thing.
[07:46:35] <PigDude_> Cork: and as you might expect, i'm not a fan of o['prefix' + something]()
[07:47:34] <PigDude_> does anybody know how to get access to the autocomplete elements themselves in a `create` listener? e.target is the <input>, but there's other widget stuff
[07:47:56] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Your variable names aren't right, also, just doing someCollection.val() will only grab the top value.
[07:49:12] <BillCriswell> The first item in the collections value.*
[07:49:49] <Cork> PigDude_: i meant what widgetfactory does is almost the same thing
[07:49:55] <reynierpm> BillCriswell I have updated the code http://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/uxp8qfc0/1/ but still not getting the expected result
[07:50:01] <Cork> it isn't exactly the same cause that call goes through a function
[07:50:11] <reynierpm> BillCriswell what else could be wrong there?
[07:50:58] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: That's not how you get that item from the collection.
[07:52:05] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: You'd want .eq(i) and .eq(j)
[07:52:27] <reynierpm> BillCriswell but still not working :-\ I moved to jsbin http://jsbin.com/bolorunalu/1/edit?js,console,output
[07:52:47] <reynierpm> BillCriswell where? I am not following you
[07:52:51] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Are you reading what I'm writing?
[07:53:02] <reynierpm> BillCriswell yes I read it right now
[07:57:23] <PigDude_> Cork: forcing an extensible api to be have a totally fluent interface is .... well, it's an idea!
[07:57:41] <PigDude_> Cork: and it forces decisions like those. i'll grant it's a marvel that the result is workable
[07:59:14] <reynierpm> BillCriswell you still here?
[07:59:18] <reynierpm> *there
[07:59:29] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:00:11] <reynierpm> BillCriswell I am not following you around your latest coment .eq(i) .eq(j) can you help me to get that part?
[08:00:51] <BillCriswell> How you're doing foo[i] and bar[j], do foo.eq(i) and bar.eq(j)
[08:02:53] <reynierpm> BillCriswell fine, I get it working now
[08:02:55] <reynierpm> thanks
[08:03:01] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:14:53] <srini__> Hello all
[08:16:40] <mr_highway> https://pastee.org/d994u  "Line 122: TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null" I dont get it.
[08:20:20] <BillCriswell> mr_highway: Are you sure the id exists?
[08:21:12] <mr_highway> BillCriswell: it does, look at line 165. function is called at line 157
[08:24:44] <cjohnson> function is called before element is created
[08:24:50] <cjohnson> so no it doesn't exist at time of execution
[08:25:17] <cjohnson> oh I haven't read your function. that code runs in a callback. still, if that's null, the element doesn't exist
[08:25:25] <cjohnson> you can confirm by console.log(document.getElementById('foo'))
[08:25:49] <mr_highway> cjohnson: but function is called onClick after the whole page is loaded... no?
[08:26:08] <cjohnson> Yeah I hadn't looked at your code. as a side note, don't use onclick HTML attributes
[08:26:19] <cjohnson> use addEventListener (or jquery's .on method)
[08:26:38] <cjohnson> but I see another possible cause. line 127
[08:26:47] <cjohnson> where you're calling it again but not passing it the same arguments
[08:26:55] <cjohnson> maybe it's null in the second callback inside the timeout
[08:26:57] <mr_highway> oh wow
[08:26:59] <mr_highway> youre right
[08:27:04] <mr_highway> thats from an older version
[08:27:56] <mr_highway> yeah it works now. thanks a lot cjohnson  :)
[08:28:25] <cjohnson> no prob
[08:28:29] <cjohnson> check out addEventListener!
[08:28:35] <mr_highway> i will :)
[08:28:38] <cjohnson> cool
[08:33:05] <mr_highway> is there a good way to check if the whole page is loaded?
[08:33:35] <cjohnson> depends what you mean by loaded
[08:33:51] <cjohnson> You can listen for hte DOMContentLoaded event to be sure the whole DOM has been read, at least
[08:34:13] <cjohnson> $(document).ready(function() { /* code to be run on DOMContentLoaded */ }) is jquery's wrapper for that
[08:34:30] <cjohnson> that doesn't mean all assets are loaded, just that the HTML document has been read and parsed at least
[08:34:53] <mr_highway> i want to know if all images and all code is loaded
[08:34:57] <mr_highway> are loaded
[08:35:16] <mr_highway> sry for my weak english :)
[08:35:37] <BillCriswell> mr_highway: There's a nice imagesLoaded plugin for jQuery.
[08:35:42] <cjohnson> no problem, it's an ambiguous territory (checking for pages to be loaded)
[08:36:02] <cjohnson> yeah there's no easy solution to it, it basically means waiting for all img nodes to fire onload
[08:36:05] <cjohnson> I believe
[08:36:29] <BillCriswell> mr_highway: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/
[08:36:29] <mr_highway> i see there is document.readyState. is this the right thing for me? :)
[08:37:14] <cjohnson> hrm this SO suggests $(window).load will fire after all images are loaded? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/544993/official-way-to-ask-jquery-wait-for-all-images-to-load-before-executing-somethin
[08:37:19] <BillCriswell> mr_highway: Oh, then you might want $(window).load
[08:37:36] <cjohnson> guess it depends if your images are dynamically added?
[08:38:20] <mr_highway> hmm ok i will try a few things. thx guys!
[08:39:18] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Think so.
[08:52:16] <reynierpm> how do I get the next(td) text if the current var is not a jQuery object? See the code here http://jsbin.com/bejupedevi/1/edit?js,console,output I need to get the text on each td for show a output like Item 1- Item 2 and so on, my code is not working in first cause itemsArr is empty all the time
[08:52:40] <robertmaxrees> use .each() for those instead.
[08:53:05] <robertmaxrees> and tie the two groups together using something less ephemeral than an order in the page.
[08:53:35] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees are you talking to me? I mean those suggestions are for me?
[08:53:39] <robertmaxrees> yes
[08:53:56] <reynierpm> ummm use $.each where exactly?
[08:54:02] <robertmaxrees> not $.each()
[08:54:07] <robertmaxrees> $().each()
[08:54:14] <robertmaxrees> firstTblItems.each()
[08:54:26] <reynierpm> ah I see for get the jQuery object, right?
[08:54:32] <robertmaxrees> right.
[08:54:43] <reynierpm> ok give me a few minutes let me try
[08:54:44] <reynierpm> brb
[08:54:49] <robertmaxrees> though i wonder - what are you actually trying to do here?
[08:55:38] <reynierpm> I am trying to get possible combinations between each checkbox marked on table one and the ones marked on second table
[08:55:41] <Es0teric> if i have multiple text input fields that i am supposed to be grabbing data from, how would i go about doing htat
[08:55:45] <Es0teric> *that?
[08:56:03] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm that doesn't make any sense.
[08:56:07] <reynierpm> I am sure my code is not the best approach
[08:56:16] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric .each() and .val()
[08:56:27] <reynierpm> what you mean with does not has any sense?
[08:56:37] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm your code isn't doing what you think it is :)
[08:56:38] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: so should i just assign each input field with one class and then .val() the current one the user is on?
[08:57:27] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric basically.  you can also find/filter the input[type="text"] inputs.
[08:57:39] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ummm what is wrong in my code? could you give me some example code?
[08:57:47] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm what would the resultant data look like?
[08:58:21] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees waits let me write in a DIV just for example purpose
[08:58:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: so then something like this should theoretically work right? http://pastebin.com/B2FfWExv
[08:59:32] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric are you trying to grab values or init typeahead?
[08:59:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i am trying to target the input the user is on to init typeahead
[09:00:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:00:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[09:00:37] <robertmaxrees> $('.tagsInput', this); is finding all $('.tagsInput') elements on the page.
[09:00:43] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: simple.. the user clicks on an input field, then the user starts typing — typeahead should popup with suggestions
[09:00:59] <robertmaxrees> then just do var $input = $('.tagsInput');
[09:01:04] <robertmaxrees> no need for the .find()
[09:01:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok let me see
[09:02:28] <Omar-> b-ot y u no have games?
[09:02:28] <b-ot> Omar-: cannot predict now.
[09:03:14] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/bejupedevi/1/edit?js,console,output take a look to the content on the DIV
[09:03:21] <reynierpm> this is what I need to achieve
[09:03:39] <reynierpm> and yes my code is complete wrong I am not considering all the possible combinations
[09:03:42] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm so then why are you looking for all checked boxes?
[09:03:42] <reynierpm> :-\
[09:03:55] <robertmaxrees> do you just want every possible combination?
[09:04:08] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes
[09:04:14] <reynierpm> non repeated of course
[09:05:31] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm is it possible for you to modify your markup at all?
[09:05:39] <reynierpm> yes, of course
[09:05:53] <bmrla22> Hi guys! I have a jquery ui window with lots of content. <div id=myWindow>lots of content.</div> I want to load everything only when the user requestes it for the first time (it is a single-page app). How is this best done ? What is the "most elegant" approach ?
[09:06:47] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm check out http://api.jquery.com/map/ in that case
[09:07:36] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees and how that helps me?
[09:07:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to map one object to another.
[09:07:48] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs :)
[09:07:48] <bmrla22> Any arguments against fetching the content with ajax and inserting it in the current page ?
[09:08:03] <robertmaxrees> bmrla22 that's the only way to do what you're looking for :)
[09:08:14] <bmrla22> yeha, i know how it works in principle.
[09:08:19] <bmrla22> But how is it "best done"?
[09:08:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a really open ended question.
[09:08:34] <bmrla22> Mhh i see
[09:10:16] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm http://jsbin.com/tabuluxubi/1/edit?html,js,console,output like this.
[09:10:42] <bmrla22> i want to load the window markup + the javascript for the window logic.  using jquery's load() function seems a bit dirty, or is it just me who thinks so? :)
[09:11:14] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer using $.ajax() for everything so it's clear - there are two .load() methods available, which can be confusing.
[09:11:29] <robertmaxrees> the .load() you're thinking of just uses $.ajax() under the hood anyway.
[09:12:10] <bmrla22> yeha thats what i find cleaner, load the content and then insert it behind the last child element of <body>
[09:12:22] <bmrla22> thanks
[09:12:27] <robertmaxrees> you can also replace content, instead.
[09:12:37] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes, instead of get the output as array what changes needs to be made in order to get the two objects mapped? I´ll need to access some properties later for build the new table with values and text
[09:12:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:12:56] <Omar-> robertmaxrees nice example of using .map()
[09:13:04] <robertmaxrees> Omar- that's exactly what it's for.
[09:13:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:13:25] <Omar-> I've alwasy wondered how to use .map()
[09:13:29] <Omar-> always*
[09:13:44] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of like .each() in a way.
[09:13:50] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees this http://jsbin.com/buletuqupi/1/edit?js,console,output
[09:13:55] <Larado> hi i got this line, var dataSlide = $('#slider-img').data("slide").split(',');        which gives an error on .split() if #slider-img doesnt exist on the page, how do i avoid that error ?
[09:14:08] <reynierpm> just remove .val() and let the .map() map the entire $(this) object
[09:14:28] <cjohnson> check if the $('#slider-img').length > 0 before running that Larado
[09:14:32] <robertmaxrees> Larado if ($('#slider-img').data('slide')) {}
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> check of the data attribute first.
[09:14:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of the element.
[09:14:49] <robertmaxrees> because .split() will fail on undefined iirc.
[09:15:29] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm hold up.
[09:15:35] <robertmaxrees> before it was that you just wanted the values.
[09:15:44] <Larado> robertmaxrees so if ($('#slider-img').data('slide')) {   var dataSlide = $('#slider-img').data("slide").split(',');  }   ?
[09:15:49] <robertmaxrees> now you're saying you want an array of pairs of objects.  that's a really bad idea.
[09:15:58] <robertmaxrees> Larado or use a ternary.
[09:16:14] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm what's this strange structure for?
[09:17:11] <srini__> Hi I am new to jquery need help of getting values from dynamically created rows
[09:17:20] <srini__> my fiddle is here :http://jsfiddle.net/srinpashu/mo8zhytw/
[09:17:37] <srini__> when I press the Show button I want to print the contents of the array...
[09:17:50] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees waits, as you have seen on the example (the text on the DIV) I need, get the pair values as your example does cause I will need for set the value for a new checkbox but also gets the text values for show at UX level what 1-1 means and so on
[09:17:54] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees get it?
[09:17:57] <reynierpm> my point?
[09:18:19] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm so you need to hold references of each combo so you can get AND set values?
[09:18:46] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yep, something like that
[09:18:57] <mmeallin_> is $('#form').serializeArray() the equivalent of getting the form's formdata?
[09:19:05] <reynierpm> for that reason I try to pass the entire jQuery obj
[09:19:32] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm then .map() isn't what you want - what you're trying to do is very strange.
[09:20:01] <robertmaxrees> actually, you COULD use map.
[09:20:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[09:20:20] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees see this little example, your code return this 1-1 but what is that to your eyes? nothing, right? what I need is something like <input type=¨checkbox¨ value=¨1-1¨> Item 1-Item1
[09:20:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:21:18] <reynierpm> yes .map is the way I though I am dig in the second example on this docs http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:21:38] <reynierpm> and seeing how they play with .text() and some others jQuery methods
[09:21:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:22:00] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees lol?
[09:22:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm laughing.  that's all.
[09:22:41] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees why?
[09:23:31] <robertmaxrees> because you need to slow down.
[09:23:46] <reynierpm> hahaha ok one thing at one time
[09:23:47] <robertmaxrees> if you think map is the way to go, experiment and figure it out ;)
[09:24:34] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees well this is what I was doing but you told me that map the entire jQuery obj is wrong and I stopped
[09:24:44] <reynierpm> looking for a better suggestion from you
[09:25:23] <robertmaxrees> you should really generate this in the backend.
[09:25:25] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:27:16] <DRSK> any check to see if an element is "not" visible by having opacity 0? as far as I can tell :visible won't trigger on that?
[09:28:41] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees take a look to the example once again http://jsbin.com/buletuqupi/1/edit?html,js,console,output result table is the output I am looking for but generated dynamic from possible non repeated combinations for each selected checkbox
[09:29:02] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm the whole "selected checkbox" part of this isn't making much sense.
[09:29:39] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I mean the one selected on the first table agains the ones selected on the second
[09:29:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees has more sense to you?
[09:29:57] <cjohnson> DRSK: you could check .is(':visible') && .css('opacity') > 0
[09:30:30] <DRSK> Ah ofc, I was just confused as "visible" in my mind would actually be false if opacity is 0 :))
[09:31:00] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Not sure if .css('opacity') will return a number? Might need a +.
[09:31:15] <cjohnson> DRSK: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/740e190223d19a114d5373758127285d14d6b71e/src/css/hiddenVisibleSelectors.js
[09:31:30] <cjohnson> BillCriswell: it appears to return a number. most of the jquery CSS things return numbers I believe
[09:31:43] <cjohnson> not sure all the cases where it happens but my fiddle works with that code
[09:33:13] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Definitely returns a string, just did a quick test.
[09:33:25] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: http://jsbin.com/fefiyerina/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:33:35] <BillCriswell> just wanted to mention that in case it bites anyone in the ass.
[09:39:54] <srini__> if I am doing a obj.push say three things x,y,z... how do I refer to only x in the for each loop?
[09:40:02] <uwjesq> Hello. What did I do wrong when jquery is only available through jQuery and not $?
[09:40:16] <robertmaxrees> uwjesq noConflict mode is one.
[09:40:35] <robertmaxrees> srini__ why are you using an each if you want to access only the first item?
[09:40:41] <uwjesq> robertmaxrees: Does it turn itself on or did I do it?
[09:40:53] <robertmaxrees> uwjesq you or something else did.  are you using wordpress?
[09:41:58] <srini__> robertmaxrees, I am a newbie.... not sure what I am doing... I am creating a dynamic array to read the values of x, y, z and then trying to access the values of x and y and z as I do with the arrays
[09:42:20] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ srini__
[09:42:20] <b-ot> srini__: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:42:41] <uwjesq> robertmaxrees: No it is based on magento and I have kicked all the prototype out and use my own jquery installation.
[09:43:04] <uwjesq> robertmaxrees: How would I enable noConflict so I can grep for it?
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> uwjesq check this out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[09:43:13] <srini__> http://jsfiddle.net/srinpashu/mo8zhytw/
[09:43:18] <Es0teric> alright alright robertmaxrees one more question…
[09:43:45] <srini__> I am trying to get the values when I press "show" in <div id="result"></div>
[09:44:06] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/vX6C4FmK something here is conflicting.. its not allowing whatever is tied to input on line 4 to execute
[09:44:50] <bmrla22> string = string + "added string";
[09:44:59] <bmrla22> is there alternative syntax for that?
[09:45:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:45:06] <uwjesq> robertmaxrees: Thanks a lot.
[09:45:09] <robertmaxrees> strings are immutable, bmrla22
[09:45:44] <bmrla22> robertmaxrees: they can'tb changed ?
[09:45:57] <robertmaxrees> not in place.  you have to do what you just did.
[09:47:30] <bmrla22> Ah that you mean
[09:47:30] <bmrla22> Thanks
[09:51:12] <Es0teric> hey robertmaxrees so did you get a chance to take a look at my paste?
[09:51:25] <robertmaxrees> sorry, got pulled into work stuff :)
[09:51:33] <robertmaxrees> var $input = $('#galleryTitles');
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> the comment before that says "//for articles" - the plural is worrying.
[09:52:11] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah because one is to get gallery titles for articles and the other is to get article titles for galleries
[09:52:22] <robertmaxrees> how many elements have that ID?
[09:52:29] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: just that element
[09:52:46] <bmrla22> If I load a .js file with .ajax, how do I best add the script / execute it? is it executed when it is added?
[09:52:51] <bmrla22> *to the DOM
[09:52:53] <robertmaxrees> bmrla22 don't do that.
[09:53:03] <robertmaxrees> load all scripts up ahead and then bind/unbind things as needed.
[09:53:26] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric then that line isn't your problem unless you're dynamically adding that element to the page.
[09:53:27] <bmrla22> i shoudl avoid to load js files dynamically?
[09:53:36] <robertmaxrees> bmrla22 yes
[09:53:41] <bmrla22> ok
[09:54:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: so then what would be the problem?
[09:54:31] <Es0teric> because both $input elements only exist once in the page
[09:54:37] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[09:54:41] <robertmaxrees> "both $input elements"
[09:54:45] <robertmaxrees> there can only be one.
[09:54:53] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: line 4 and 33
[09:55:06] <bmrla22> is there any good (i mean equally lightweight) alternative to backbone.js?
[09:55:22] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you're redefining that var unnecessarily.
[09:55:26] <robertmaxrees> bmrla22 riot.js
[09:55:33] <bmrla22> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[09:55:55] <robertmaxrees> without seeing how your stuff is failing it's hard to help.
[09:56:05] <robertmaxrees> i gotta get some actual work done, otherwise i'd dump through this :)
[09:56:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: how am i redefining it uneccesarily
[09:56:20] <Es0teric> they are two different inputs that exist on different pages
[09:56:36] <robertmaxrees> you're creating a layer of complexity you don't need.
[09:56:41] <robertmaxrees> give them different names.
[09:56:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: oh i see now
[09:57:12] <robertmaxrees> that might not necessarily fix everything, but it'll make stuff a helluva lot less confusing.
[10:01:51] <srini__> Any help for me:(
[10:02:04] <robertmaxrees> srini__ your question and fiddle were confusing.
[10:02:37] <srini__> robertmaxrees, I was actually referring to item_name, item_price, item_quantity as xyz
[10:02:53] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really change anything ;)
[10:03:10] <srini__> I am trying to get the values of each row
[10:03:24] <robertmaxrees> where?
[10:03:28] <robertmaxrees> and for what?
[10:03:47] <srini__> I want to pass this values to my jsp
[10:04:01] <niop> hi, doing a simple dom node traversal, so simple, it's extraordinary there's even a need to post here, but it goes into endless loop.  if anyone could have a glance, maybe you might have an idea why.  baffled.   codepen: http://codepen.io/jasonVeldicott/pen/vExGGY  or gist of just the function:  https://gist.github.com/jasonVeld/c52e745c36d936685374
[10:04:01] <robertmaxrees> then .each() through the TRs can grab the val()
[10:04:07] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do it, srini__
[10:04:36] <robertmaxrees> niop posting links that lock up people's browsers is kindof a dick move ;)
[10:05:11] <srini__> robertmaxrees, I am really new to jquery.. can you suggest some simple reading on the net.. google is complicating
[10:05:22] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery each
[10:05:24] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery.each() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[10:05:29] <robertmaxrees> wrong one.
[10:05:42] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/each/ this one.
[10:06:03] <Gevox> Hello, can someone tell me how to create images thumbnail like this one http://images.imgdady.com/temp_rH7hra.jpeg
[10:06:09] <niop> it's mentioned at least it goes into endless loop. it would take a moment to kill page.  i guess a preferred way to do it would be to do it by "button".  rather than on load. apology for inconvenience with that.  this is dev stuff though.
[10:06:26] <robertmaxrees> niop what are you actually trying to do here?
[10:07:15] <niop> send dom node to function, and it does a depth first traversal of nodes from that specified node. it's that simple.
[10:07:29] <robertmaxrees> niop right - what's the traversal for though?
[10:08:51] <niop> well, binding for click, and it's not working. for unknown reasons. it does from one menu, but doesn't bind on an exact copy of the menu.  the only explanation i have for that bind problem is that the menu structure isn't the same.
[10:09:11] <niop> so.. doing a print of the menus. dom wise.  to compare, and output bind info.
[10:09:16] <robertmaxrees> niop why are you traversing like this?  what actual problem are you trying to solve?
[10:09:20] <robertmaxrees> compare why?
[10:09:27] <robertmaxrees> something here smells.
[10:10:27] <niop> using a theme, there's a main menu and a footer menu. they're exactly the same dom structures, and bound on click to same load_ajax() function.
[10:10:59] <niop> but from the footer menu, $().href... or whatever it is.. is undefined.  just for the footer menu. so links dont work from that menu.
[10:11:28] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual error you're getting?
[10:11:29] <niop> $(this).attrib('href') in the click handler
[10:11:50] <robertmaxrees> that's because attrib() isn't a thing.
[10:11:51] <mr_highway> if theres no anchor in the url is window.location.hash an empty string or is it NULL?
[10:12:20] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway wut
[10:13:23] <mr_highway> robertmaxrees: hmm dunno how to say it in a more understandable way :)
[10:13:26] <niop> been on the traversal thing for hours, so haven't the error output of href value.. in the handler.  but i think either undefined, or pointed to window.
[10:13:46] <robertmaxrees> niop this isn't really a good way to fix your problem.
[10:13:53] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway you mean if there isn't an href on an anchor?
[10:14:07] <niop> window.location.hash...  i dont think there's a hash.
[10:14:15] <mr_highway> what is the value of window.location.hash if there is no anchor?
[10:14:16] <niop> it's not in the href in the <a> tag
[10:14:36] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway it depends on the browser iirc.
[10:15:02] <niop> robertmaxrees: you mean dom traversal?
[10:15:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:27] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[10:15:29] <mr_highway> hmm ok so i have to use switch. it's better anyway. but thx robertmaxrees :)
[10:15:35] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway use an if.
[10:16:05] <niop> robertmaxrees: this is the theme code $.address.value($et_this_link.attr('href').replace(et_site_data.site_url, ''));
[10:16:38] <niop> and the problem is that for the footer menu, attr('href') is undefined.
[10:16:43] <robertmaxrees> niop copy the markup from the inspector and compare the two.
[10:16:44] <niop> pretty sure that was the problem.
[10:17:19] <niop> i've tried that i'm pretty sure. but it doesn't show bind info
[10:17:44] <robertmaxrees> it might be a delegated listener instead.
[10:17:50] <niop> but could double check.. even if it's different, the bindings are there. so clicks should load properly
[10:18:06] <robertmaxrees> might be improperly nested markup, as well.
[10:18:29] <niop> maybe that was stuffing up the traversal
[10:18:58] <niop> but it is a clone of the main menu, which works. not to say that something isn't modifying it though
[10:19:14] <robertmaxrees> how are you cloning it?
[10:19:26] <niop> its part of the theme.. can get the code
[10:19:33] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[10:19:41] <robertmaxrees> don't need to see if - if it's generated that way in the backend.
[10:20:35] <robertmaxrees> are IDs getting replicated or something?
[10:21:00] <niop> it's at the front, running in local js
[10:21:18] <robertmaxrees> are you running a .clone() to generate the footer or something?
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up is why i ask and it looks like you're overcomplicating the issue.
[10:21:48] <niop>  $('<div id="footer_menu"></div>').appendTo('body');
[10:21:49] <niop>             $et_footer_menu = $('#footer_menu');
[10:21:49] <niop>             $main_menu.clone().appendTo('#footer_menu');
[10:21:56] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste in the channel.
[10:22:11] <niop> creates div.. and then clones into it
[10:22:25] <niop> sorry..  there's a thing against that it seems.. not a frequent visitor in irc.
[10:22:36] <robertmaxrees> it spams the channel
[10:23:01] <coach_McGuirk> im having issues figuring whats going wrong with my jquery if/else statement.  It runs both of them instead of just one of the statements
[10:23:04] <niop> personally i like seeing bits of code.. but i guess if it ends up swamped, it diminishes readability
[10:23:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:23:17] <robertmaxrees> that's why we use jsfiddle and fixee and related sites.
[10:23:31] <robertmaxrees> either way, check to make sure $main_menu is what you think it is.
[10:26:07] <niop> when you say ids getting replicated, they are probably,. between the menus, main and footer. but i magine that's intended. you think that might cause a problem handling clicks?
[10:26:22] <robertmaxrees> niop you cannot duplicate IDs.
[10:26:27] <robertmaxrees> that can cause all kinds of headaches.
[10:27:51] <niop> <li> ids are indentical in the menu copies.
[10:28:08] <niop> might check the official theme page to see if that's the case there as well. if it is..
[10:29:09] <niop> same there as well
[10:29:09] <robertmaxrees> wait are you trying to debug the theme's code?
[10:29:11] <niop> and it's menus work
[10:29:19] <niop> converting from wp to html/css
[10:30:01] <niop> debugging in the conversion process
[10:30:09] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[10:31:01] <niop> it's messy stuff, the code, but i guess ui stuff tends to be that way.  and web as well, a lot of being added on piecewise as people though up new ways of doing things.
[10:31:15] <niop> *thought
[10:31:34] <mAxX--> Any idea why is this? No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
[10:32:18] <niop> robertmaxrees:  this is the value of $(this)  in the click handler..  (not code really)...
[10:32:20] <niop> "$(this) is....." custom.js:213:16
[10:32:20] <niop> Object { 0: Window → localhost:3000, length: 1 }
[10:32:41] <niop> it should really be the <li> menu item
[10:33:01] <niop> based on its value for the menu that works
[10:33:33] <niop> so the question is.. why is the bind in the case of the footer menu, invoking the handler, with this equal to window rather than <li>
[10:34:07] <niop> *with "this" equal to..
[10:35:25] <robertmaxrees> niop because the binding is broken.
[10:35:33] <robertmaxrees> mAxX-- CORS
[10:36:08] <niop> mAxX--:  you're running locally but accessing something off another server.  i think you need to enable cross origin or something on the server.
[10:36:25] <robertmaxrees> mAxX-- needs to be the same port, protocol, and domain.
[10:36:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, the server needs to explicitly allow CORS
[10:37:31] <mAxX--> robertmaxrees: any idea how to do that in django
[10:37:51] <mAxX--> damn im in the wrong channel
[10:37:53] <robertmaxrees> search the internet for it.
[10:37:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:37:56] <niop> robertmaxrees: any idea why the binding would be broken, when it's bound to the same function as the main menu, and the function is actually invoked.  it's the context that's being mesed up, "this" being window rather than li.  maybe related to delegates.
[10:38:14] <robertmaxrees> niop i'd have to see the binding code.
[10:38:43] <niop> a line.. ok to drop that here?
[10:38:45] <Eels> Evening.
[10:38:47] <niop> of code
[10:39:03] <niop> it's ok.. i'll put in gist or something
[10:40:19] <niop> https://gist.github.com/jasonVeld/ea5df886c9faaab5c1d3
[10:41:46] <robertmaxrees> use .on() and try a single delegated listener on the body instead.
[10:43:24] <niop> might have no choice, and seems a reasonable way to do it,, although delegate bit unfamiliar with.  but there's nothing presumably which stands out as being erroneous potentially in that bind setup.
[10:43:33] <niop> could try changing the ids. just in case
[10:44:19] <niop> could try binding to another function.
[10:44:23] <niop> but might be the same deal
[10:44:51] <niop> its a weird behavior that the source of the click would be lost when invoking click handler
[10:45:23] <coach_McGuirk>  im having issues figuring whats going wrong with my jquery if/else statement.  im trying to toggle the display visible when draggable is placed into droppable.  If another draggable is placed into droppable, i want to toggle the display to none
[10:45:44] <Bloomberg> l
[10:45:58] <Bloomberg> someone know how can I login my freenode user?
[10:46:15] <Eels> Try /msg NickServ password
[10:46:36] <Bloomberg> Thanks
[10:48:09] <niop> robertmaxrees: this is element incidentally.. <a href=http://localhost:3000/gallery.html>
[10:48:16] <niop> and the binding on it...
[10:48:23] <niop> Object { type: click, origType: click, data: Object, handler: et_load_link_with_ajax(), guid: 25, selector: null, needsContext: null, namespace:  }
[10:48:57] <niop> so it's all set up with the binding code, just not executing properly
[10:49:52] <Dry_Lips> Hi everyone... I'm inexperienced when it comes to jquery, and I've got a quick question. I'm trying use jquery to import html in order to make a master footer and header pages, and so far I've been using the load() method. However, scripts included in the html aren't exectuted properly. Is there a way around this? Do you have any advice or relevant links about what to do in such a situation?
[10:50:44] <robertmaxrees> niop something isn't adding up here.  without seeing it all in action i can't really help much.  the way you're chaining things looks kind of confusing to my eyes, but i'm not really able to dig n atm
[10:52:38] <Eels> Quick question: in .addClass(($(this).closest('section').attr('class')).split(' ')[0]); - how do I fix the quotes again?
[10:53:47] <niop> that's fine.. you've already been very generous with your comments.  the issue relates to binding, and you've mentioned delegates, ids, and on().  and comparing menu structures.  wont burden you with more without first investigating further
[10:54:04] <niop> although. i'd still be curious to know why that simple depth first search code doesn't work.
[10:55:05] <niop> it's using jquery children(), handier than using dom siblings().  but on the menu stucture, as in the page that froze for you, with apology, it goes on endlessly.
[10:55:12] <niop> and the logic couldn't be simpler.
[10:55:54] <robertmaxrees> the for in loop seemed funky there.
[10:56:29] <niop> for if i guess you mean
[10:56:36] <niop> funky in a bad way?
[10:57:12] <niop> ya, it looks fine
[10:57:31] <niop> it actually repeats on the last element
[10:57:32] <niop> li

[11:15:56] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I've been using jqm for years and have several apps in production with 1.3.2. I'm wondering if you can tell me: A) What is the 1.5 planned release date? B) Migration from 1.3->1.4 is time consuming and difficult, at this point would you recommend waiting for 1.5?
[11:16:20] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: Hi
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> i would NOT upgrade to 1.4 right now
[11:16:35] <arschmitz> i would wait for 1.5
[11:16:46] <maxmoore14> ok, great. I appreciate the advice
[11:16:56] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: time line will be first quarter
[11:16:59] <arschmitz> we are getting close
[11:17:13] <maxmoore14> great
[11:17:28] <maxmoore14> what is the best place to keep informed of news/updates?
[11:17:43] <arschmitz> read the weekly meeting notes
[11:17:58] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/

[11:21:40] <maxmoore14> thanks arschmitz, I will
[11:27:34] <niop> robertmaxrees: changing the click handler fixed it.
[11:27:45] <niop> having separate handlers fro each menu.
[11:27:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[11:35:35] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, how do I select something by class, but only if it's a sibling?
[11:35:50] <Scriptonaut> I want to select the .dropdown who has the same parent as $(this)
[11:36:27] <robertmaxrees> go to the parent and run a .find() then.
[11:36:44] <Scriptonaut> I could do that, but I'm inside the function for a bind
[11:36:56] <Scriptonaut> Could I do: $("this ~ sibling")
[11:37:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:37:03] <shoky> .siblings('.class')
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ this would be the other way.
[11:37:16] <Scriptonaut> hmm, alright I'll do that
[11:37:16] <robertmaxrees> but breaks if the markup changes.
[11:37:31] <Scriptonaut> any of you have experience with ~
[11:37:33] <notchris> Pretty noob question, what are the names of the “options” for a script?
[11:37:35] <Scriptonaut> http://api.jquery.com/next-siblings-selector/
[11:37:45] <notchris> In ex: autoPlay : true
[11:37:50] <notchris> If it were a slider
[11:38:57] <robertmaxrees> those are properties in an object.
[11:40:08] <notchris> Thank you @robertmaxrees
[11:42:38] <robertmaxrees> twitter.
[11:43:45] <coach_McGuirk> im having issues figuring whats going wrong with my jquery if/else statement.  im trying to toggle the display visible when draggable is placed into droppable.  If another draggable is placed into droppable, i want to toggle the display to none
[11:43:57] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk share the code :)
[11:44:07] <robertmaxrees> btw there's no such thing as a "jquery if/else statement" :D
[11:44:28] <notchris> @robertmaxrees :)
[11:44:28] <chriys> hey guys I'm animating a circle and I'm wondering if it's possible to start the animate from it's center instead of the top corner.
[11:45:03] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/qfd7d2nb/
[11:45:29] <robertmaxrees> which line?
[11:45:41] <robertmaxrees> if (this == ui.draggable) { ?
[11:45:53] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: YES
[11:46:01] <coach_McGuirk> sorry caps
[11:46:15] <coach_McGuirk> yes the whole statement
[11:46:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't compare objects like that.
[11:47:09] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual comparison you're trying to run?
[11:48:10] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: im trying to compare the current draggable that was placed into the drop
[11:49:02] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: if its the current, display it.  If another draggable is placed into the droppable, hide the old one and show the new one
[11:49:34] <coach_McGuirk> i am struggling with how to identify current draggable so i use "this"
[11:50:13] <robertmaxrees> iirc ui.draggable IS "this"
[11:50:17] <robertmaxrees> rather.
[11:50:28] <robertmaxrees> the currently dropped draggable is ui.draggable
[11:50:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll need some other way to identify the one you care about and go from there.
[11:51:14] <robertmaxrees> also jsfiddle doesn't actually allow <body>, <head>, <doctype>, etc.
[11:51:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qfd7d2nb/3/ you want this instead :)
[11:52:25] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: it doesnt run when they are there?
[11:52:43] <coach_McGuirk> i just ignored it cuase i thought it still ran regardless
[11:53:25] <robertmaxrees> it runs, but you're not supposed to include them
[11:53:29] <robertmaxrees> it can break things in weird ways.
[11:53:58] <coach_McGuirk> gotcha, do you have any recommendations how to identify the current draggable vs the previous one?
[11:54:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to store state somewhere.
[11:54:21] <robertmaxrees> or think of it in terms of "current" vs. "all others"
[11:55:11] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.state/ ?
[11:55:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> i mean you need to have a variable that tracks the "last" one.
[11:56:20] <Scriptonaut> can someone explain the difference between doing $(document).on "event", "element" ... vs $("element").on "event"
[11:56:27] <robertmaxrees> one is delegated.
[11:56:29] <robertmaxrees> the other isn't.
[11:56:48] <Scriptonaut> what does "delegated" mean in this context
[11:57:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:02:36] <Scriptonaut> ah, so if I want to be able to handle events that occur on elements that are added at random times after pageload, I should do: $(document).on "event", "elm"
[12:03:19] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: ok, seems like a challenge but a good one to learn from
[12:03:36] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut bind further down than $(document) if you can, but yeah.
[12:03:54] <robertmaxrees> it also saves a little bit on overhead because you only bind one listener instead of many.
[12:03:56] <Scriptonaut> k, thanks
[12:05:53] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: so maybe i can store the text from the p tag somewhere and call that
[12:06:07] <coach_McGuirk> is that what you mean by the state?
[12:06:14] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk give the elements unique ID's and store that, instead.
[12:06:34] <robertmaxrees> but you want to "highlight" the most recently dropped one, right?
[12:06:48] <coach_McGuirk> yea
[12:06:56] <robertmaxrees> then don't muck with state.
[12:07:07] <mAxX--> well i believe using YQL helps for CORS
[12:07:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:07:22] <mAxX--> only solution i got
[12:07:29] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk :) worry about unhighlighting all droppables that AREN'T the current one.
[12:07:32] <robertmaxrees> mAxX-- for what?
[12:08:13] <mAxX--> robertmaxrees:  for cross origin requests
[12:08:23] <robertmaxrees> mAxX-- wut
[12:08:31] <robertmaxrees> YQL is a way to scrape data and stuff.
[12:08:52] <robertmaxrees> depending on the case, there are other (better) ways to handle CORS
[12:08:54] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: ill see what i can figure out logically with that, thats a new approach than what im use to
[12:09:26] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk $('.whateverclass').not($(this)).removeClass('highlight'). or whatever.
[12:10:11] <coach_McGuirk> thats easier than i thought
[12:10:36] <coach_McGuirk> thanks
[12:11:18] <mAxX--> http://jsfiddle.net/4300x2fd/1/
[12:11:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:12:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use your own server to get around CORS btw.
[12:12:50] <robertmaxrees> also i'm going to guess that yahoo won't like you hammering their service like that.
[12:12:52] <robertmaxrees> but who knows.
[12:13:54] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: are you on twitter btw?
[12:14:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:14:21] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: can i add you?
[12:14:34] <robertmaxrees> do what you want :)
[12:15:14] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: ok, found u and added
[12:15:56] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[12:16:34] <coach_McGuirk> https://twitter.com/robertmaxrees
[12:16:45] <robertmaxrees> weird.  didn't see it come through.
[12:17:37] <gingertea> Hi guys! I'm new to this whole javascript/jquery thingy and could use some help. I'm making a simple to-do list but would like to add an "edit" button so you can edit entries but can't seem to figure it out on my own.
[12:17:38] <gingertea> http://jsfiddle.net/b9hj6bh4/
[12:17:48] <gingertea> Could somebody lend me his/hers expertise?
[12:18:17] <robertmaxrees> gingertea sure - where do you think you'd start?
[12:18:46] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  by adding an edit button and then add a function to it?
[12:18:58] <robertmaxrees> :) bingo.
[12:19:02] <gingertea> I did that.
[12:19:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not in the fiddle.
[12:19:17] <gingertea> Oh sorry.
[12:19:23] <gingertea> Let me update it.
[12:19:57] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/y21tcec1/ here you go
[12:20:17] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery btw?
[12:20:28] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  2.0.3
[12:20:49] <robertmaxrees> cool - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y21tcec1/2/ close enough.
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> okayt.
[12:21:02] <robertmaxrees> so do you see the problem with your editListItem function?
[12:21:31] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  Well yeah. It should save the already written text so i can add more to it.
[12:21:53] <robertmaxrees> a prompt() is a bad way to do that.
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> what else is wrong with it?
[12:22:44] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  no idea. Should it like save the already written entry to console or something?
[12:22:52] <gingertea> I followed a simple tutorial to get this far.
[12:23:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not tying that data back to the one you clicked.
[12:23:33] <gingertea> aha
[12:23:37] <gingertea> to the edit button?
[12:23:47] <robertmaxrees> notice how every other one has some kind of $(this) reference?
[12:23:57] <gingertea> yeah
[12:24:03] <robertmaxrees> did the tutorial explain what $(this) is.
[12:24:16] <gingertea> I don't remember to be honest.
[12:24:44] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is a reference to the button that was clicked.
[12:25:22] <robertmaxrees> so notice how there are a lot of $(this).parent() calls?  that's getting the parent of the clicked button.
[12:25:22] <gingertea> okay so if $(this) { then show the text in a prompt ?
[12:25:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:26:24] <robertmaxrees> you first want to store which input you care about.
[12:27:02] <robertmaxrees> think about how you might do that.
[12:27:16] <gingertea> i guess that would be the <li> that i care about?
[12:27:31] <robertmaxrees> the <input>
[12:27:51] <gingertea> isnt input just the checkbox?
[12:28:07] <robertmaxrees> oh, sorry, woah.
[12:28:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to wrap that li text in a span or something.
[12:28:19] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, so when binding a delegated event, you can no longer really use $(this) inside of it to reference the element that the event is attached to
[12:28:35] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut $(this) references the element that emitted the event.
[12:29:01] <Scriptonaut> hmm, in my case it's referencing the element that $ wraps around
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {}); - $(this) refers to whatever child.
[12:29:14] <Scriptonaut> for me it's referring to parent
[12:29:14] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut then you're doing something wrong :)
[12:29:15] <Scriptonaut> which is document
[12:30:09] <Scriptonaut> https://gist.github.com/robins35/2984f3b5395f80ab7bfb
[12:30:16] <Scriptonaut> the line 9 is printing document
[12:30:24] <robertmaxrees> bindWithDelay?
[12:30:42] <robertmaxrees> why are you delaying the bind?
[12:30:57] <gingertea> robertmaxrees:  could we take this in private window? there's a lot of text and its hard to follow
[12:31:07] <Scriptonaut> hmm, I think so we can get an ajax response
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> gingertea sure.
[12:31:10] <Scriptonaut> I didn't write that part
[12:31:22] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut try that with a .on() instead.
[12:31:56] <Scriptonaut> when I do on, i get, "This is not a function"
[12:32:02] <Scriptonaut> fak
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:32:10] <robertmaxrees> what version of jq are you on?
[12:32:26] <Scriptonaut> 1.11.1
[12:32:29] <Scriptonaut> I think
[12:32:34] <Scriptonaut> wow that's old
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:32:39] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[12:32:42] <robertmaxrees> that's near latest.
[12:32:44] <Scriptonaut> oh, 11*
[12:32:49] <Scriptonaut> I read as 1.1
[12:33:21] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you console.log($.fn.on) right before that binding?
[12:34:09] <Scriptonaut> it prints the function
[12:34:13] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> but if you swap that custom function with 'on' it breaks?
[12:34:30] <Scriptonaut> lol is that nonstandard behavior?
[12:34:37] <Scriptonaut> ya
[12:34:43] <robertmaxrees> that isn't apart of the API.
[12:34:44] <Scriptonaut> I should ask my boss why he wrote that
[12:36:57] <Scriptonaut> http://www.briangrinstead.com/files/bindWithDelay/
[12:37:29] <Scriptonaut> I think it's so the event doesn't lock up if we don't get a response from the server in time
[12:37:35] <Scriptonaut> 200 ms in this case
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:39:53] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[12:40:44] <Scriptonaut> I'm just gonna bind it elsewhere with on after document.ready
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> if you're binding to the document, you don't even need to wait.
[12:41:12] <Scriptonaut> oh really? That's nice to know
[12:45:40] <wfq> Hi guys
[12:46:01] <wfq> I am just stuck. How do I send a new Object() to the server please?
[12:46:10] <wfq> I am running out of ideas
[12:46:21] <robertmaxrees> you post it.
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> don't use new Object(); btw
[12:47:16] <wfq> why not?
[12:47:32] <robertmaxrees> it's unnecessary.  use an object literal.
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/13/javascript-we-hardly-new-ya/ among other resources explains it.
[12:47:46] <wfq> this is how I am doing it http://pastie.org/9830275
[12:48:04] <robertmaxrees> just do var data = {},
[12:49:47] <wfq> robertmaxrees thanks. Trying right now. But I don't understand why I cannot do it. Is that I don't need or I can't do it to send it over via ajax?
[12:50:18] <robertmaxrees> that was an aside.
[12:50:24] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any errors with your code?
[12:51:34] <Dry_Lips> Hi everyone... I'm inexperienced when it comes to jquery/javascript, and I've got a quick question. I'm trying use jquery to import html in order to make a master footer and header pages, and so far I've been using the load() method. However, scripts included in the html aren't exectuted properly. Is there a way around this? Do you have any advice or relevant links about what to do in such a situation?
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> Dry_Lips load all your js up front instead.
[12:52:52] <wfq> yes I do get:  SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected end of data at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
[12:53:25] <robertmaxrees> on what line, wfq?
[12:54:46] <wfq> it doesn't say just   SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> it should say to the right what file and what line.
[12:55:39] <robertmaxrees> remove the dataType option.
[12:57:23] <wfq> that seems to be the problem
[12:57:34] <wfq> robertmaxrees thanks
[12:57:39] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> dataType specifies what you're expecting back from the server.
[12:58:00] <robertmaxrees> you normally don't need to worry about messing with it.
[12:59:12] <wfq> hmm but if dataType specifies what I am expecting from the server why it was complaining about what I was sending and not what I was receiving
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't complaining about what you were sending.
[12:59:30] <robertmaxrees> it was complaining about what you were getting back.
[12:59:40] <wfq> I think it was actually wrapping up the output of stringify into another json object again hence the problem
[12:59:51] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:00:45] <wfq> right let me do some more test in order to know what was going on here
[13:01:06] <Dry_Lips> trying to import html containing scripts via jquery, here is an example: the main page: http://pastebin.com/mLn2027H here is what I'm trying to import: http://pastebin.com/ZCsZXMe0 Sorry that I used pastebin, I don't think jsfiddle supports multiple html files
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> is the data coming back wrapped in quotes, wfq?
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> Dry_Lips what about my suggestion are you rejecting?
[13:01:26] <robertmaxrees> because what you're doing is a bad idea
[13:01:47] <wfq> I was just returning true from the server until I was able to sort out the problem I had on the client
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> wfq that's the problem.
[13:02:04] <robertmaxrees> you weren't returning valid JSON.
[13:02:13] <wfq> that's right
[13:02:32] <Dry_Lips> oh, sorry I misunderstood you, robertmaxtrees, I thought you wanted a paste
[13:02:48] <Dry_Lips> not rejecting anything, just being a noob
[13:09:00] <wfq> don't get what is going on now
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:12:22] <Scriptonaut> hmm, for some reason this event isn't firing: $(".typeahead_dropdown > .dropdown").on "click", "li". That means that it should fire anytime an li inside a .dropdown inside a .typeahead_dropdown is clicked right?
[13:13:50] <robertmaxrees> so long as .dropdown is a direct descendent of the .typeahead_dropdown, that .typeahead_dropdown exists on load, and that there isn't a preventDefault() or stopPropagation() or similar call on the event object.
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> out for lunch.  enjoy.
[13:16:26] <Scriptonaut> hmm, well all of those cases are true but I'm still not getting an event fire
[13:16:57] <Scriptonaut> ohhh, it's typeahead-dropdown, not _
[13:18:23] <dgpalmer> quick question about .after(foo), is foo set to null after this is used?
[13:21:47] <qpan> Hi, how come the this keyword or the $(this) refers to the dom element and not window object when used inside a callback function?
[13:23:24] <shoky> dgpalmer: no
[13:24:30] <shoky> qpan: because jquery sets it to be the dom element. "this" can change during function calls. can be done with .call or .apply. or .bind  on a function
[13:31:59] <wfq> the object sent to php seems to be empty
[13:34:20] <shoky> wfq are all those selectors right? you have  <questionOne>  elements?  and the others?
[13:35:36] <wfq> shoky, I am just a fucking idiot, tired, yet idiot
[13:36:10] <shoky> ;p
[13:42:31] <wfq> shoky thanks, all the time in front of my nose and couldn't see it
[14:02:47] <mAxX--> isn't this the correct way to loop through an array of objects? http://jsfiddle.net/54pz8/20/
[14:03:55] <Duvdevan> mAxX-- let us see
[14:04:05] <Duvdevan> it's easier to use
[14:04:12] <OnceMe> how is google's jquery so small?
[14:04:25] <OnceMe> it's only 35KB while on jquery.com 1.11.1 is 95KB
[14:04:27] <Duvdevan> for(var i in res) { console.log(res[i]); }
[14:04:40] <Duvdevan> it's like a foreach
[14:04:46] <Duvdevan> it is actually
[14:05:21] <OnceMe> ??
[14:05:29] <mAxX--> Duvdevan:  cant see nothing in the console
[14:05:49] <Duvdevan> you need to run it
[14:05:55] <Duvdevan> put a button or something
[14:06:10] <Duvdevan> or you might need to use "echo" service
[14:06:14] <Duvdevan> or whatever it's called
[14:06:51] <mAxX--> Duvdevan: can you show me if possible
[14:07:08] <OnceMe> how is google's jquery so small?
[14:07:12] <Duvdevan> let me try

[14:10:24] <Tamo> Anyone want to make an easy $10 via paypal? I have an updating table all working in jquery, i want the new row to flash for a few seconds when its added?
[14:10:31] <Tamo> It already loads new rows, its only flashing I need :
[14:10:34] <Tamo> :D
[14:11:05] <OnceMe> how is google's jquery so small?
[14:15:12] <shoky> OnceMe: what's "google's jquery" ? and where do you see it's 35KB?  maybe you're referring to the gzipped size
[14:15:36] <Duvdevan> yea... how small is it?
[14:16:12] <OnceMe> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[14:16:45] <mAxX--> So it should be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/54pz8/29/
[14:16:47] <mAxX--> ?
[14:16:50] <Eels> Any idea where I put the quotes to make this work? $('div.content section dt').addClass($(this).closest('section').attr('id'));
[14:17:02] <OnceMe> open console in chrome put on network tab and refresh, youll see size is 35kb and content is 95kb
[14:17:03] <shoky> OnceMe: that's the same size
[14:17:16] <shoky> OnceMe: in the network tab you see the gzipped size probably.
[14:18:35] <shoky> mAxX--:  "table" is an array
[14:19:14] <mAxX--> shoky: then i need to loop again right?
[14:19:17] <shoky> Eels the quotes are fine there
[14:19:18] <mAxX--> im new sorry
[14:19:40] <Eels> I'm not getting any errors, but it's not adding the class either :/
[14:19:48] <shoky> mAxX--: if you want to go through all items in the array, you need to loop yeah. i'd just use .forEach  instead of a for loop
[14:19:56] <shoky> or .map
[14:20:19] <shoky> Eels:  probably "this" isn't what you think it is
[14:20:24] <mAxX--> umm ok
[14:21:16] <Eels> "this" would be $('div.content section dt') , right?
[14:21:41] <shoky> no. "this" can only change inside a function call
[14:22:56] <shoky> Eels: you'd need to use .each, or pass a function to addClass:  $('div.content section dt').addClass(function() { return $(this).closest('section').attr('id') });
[14:23:22] <Eels> Is there a preferred way, or can I just pick one?
[14:23:39] <shoky> passing a function to addClass will use .each anyway
[14:23:42] <shoky> doesn't matter
[14:24:08] <Eels> Alrighty, thanks
[14:28:13] <Eels> It's working like a charm now, thanks! c:
[14:30:01] <shoky> np
[14:35:49] <mAxX--> shoky: you mean like this http://jsfiddle.net/54pz8/35/
[14:59:12] <shoky> mAxX-- sure
[15:09:44] <LindsayM_> I'm playing around with push_state for getting browser history to update with flexslider but I can't seem to get it to work...any thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/jg656orh/1/
[15:09:57] <LindsayM_> (this is code in progress. I've ripped out so much the push_state part might not make sense right now
[15:17:19] <shoky> LindsayM_: 1) you're including flexslider from localhost so the fiddle doesnt work for us. 2) you're doing event.preventDefault() when there's no actual event object. 3) this.dataset is undefined
[15:17:31] <LindsayM_> Oh crap.. sorry! Thats weird....!
[15:17:58] <Robdgreat> needs more punctuation
[15:18:48] <LindsayM_> Robdgreat: heres the link with proper source for flexslider http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/jg656orh/2/
[15:20:32] <Scriptonaut> is it hugely inefficient to go up the parent chain in order to get elements?
[15:20:48] <Robdgreat> as opposed to what?
[15:20:58] <Scriptonaut> (I was hoping there was an alternative)
[15:21:02] <Scriptonaut> but I know of none
[15:21:34] <Scriptonaut> I have a div, inside I have an input and a ul. From the perspective of one of the ul's lis, I need to get to the input
[15:21:54] <Scriptonaut> I'd have to do: $(this).parent().siblings(".people-quick-search")
[15:21:54] <shoky> LindsayM_: 1) you're calling .flexslider instead of .flexslider2 (which is what the script you included has).  2) this.dataset is still undefined ("this" isn't an element here)
[15:22:07] <Robdgreat> that's the only way I know to do it
[15:22:59] <LindsayM_> shoky:  ugh.. i'm sorry.. I feel like a doaf right now. I usually only come to these rooms after i've exhausted all options and my brain is fried. I appologixer
[15:23:42] <shoky> heh don't apologize, just letting you know what the issues are ;) no complaints
[15:23:50] <LindsayM_> shoky:  thanks
[15:23:52] <LindsayM_> shoky:  fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/jg656orh/3/
[15:24:03] <LindsayM_> but still get href as undediend.. which I guess makes sense.
[15:24:12] <LindsayM_> my whole shebang is foobared
[15:24:14] <shoky> LindsayM_: this.dataset is undefined
[15:24:15] <LindsayM_> or fubar
[15:24:29] <LindsayM_> shoky: I get  Cannot read property 'href' of undefined
[15:24:35] <shoky> right. this.dataset is undefined
[15:24:39] <LindsayM_> Oh right..
[15:25:12] <LindsayM_> well that makes sense I suppose.
[15:28:02] <LindsayM_> shoky:  i have a feeling I am too lost for this
[15:28:34] <shoky> maybe you just need a break ;p
[15:28:57] <LindsayM_> shoky:  i need to not get this.dataset.href  because I'm not setting a click event, i'm using the "BEFORE" function of flexslider as my event
[15:28:59] <LindsayM_> right?
[15:29:07] <LindsayM_> maybe i need to pee.. i've been holding it too long LOL
[15:29:15] <shoky> you need to not get this.dataset.href?  what does that mean?
[15:29:59] <LindsayM_> shoky:  meaning I need to find a different data set to get
[15:30:02] <LindsayM_> (i think)
[15:30:18] <shoky> even if "this" was an element (which it isn't), and this.dataset was defined.. you don't have any data-href anywhere..?
[15:30:34] <shoky> LindsayM_: i have no idea what you want to get.. only you know that
[15:31:06] <LindsayM_> shoky:  I am trying to get the push_state to trigger using the flexslider "before" function which triggers every time a slide is changes
[15:32:17] <shoky> LindsayM_: you can call pushState fine and it works. but not the this.dataset.href part
[15:32:37] <shoky> the error happens before pushState is even called. i have no idea what this href is that you want to set
[15:32:50] <LindsayM_> shoky:  right.. this.dataset.href is looking for a link that was clicked, right? No link is beign clicked so its not working
[15:33:28] <LindsayM_> shoky:  thats what I am agreeing with you about. I understand that using that is wrong. I am trying to figure out the right action / info to hook in to in order to trigger the push_state on the right event.
[15:33:31] <LindsayM_> does that make sense?
[15:33:35] <shoky> right this isn't a click event, it's a callback provided to a plugin
[15:33:51] <LindsayM_> right.
[15:34:00] <shoky> it will only make sense if i know where you want to take this href from
[15:34:09] <LindsayM_> So thats where I am stuck.. figuring out how to work in this plugin. I coudl probably do this easier if I was doing it from scratch
[15:34:23] <LindsayM_> shoky:  i need to make this action take place when I click the next/previous buttons
[15:34:26] <shoky> what action
[15:34:35] <shoky> what do you want to pass to pushState ?
[15:35:06] <LindsayM_> thats what I'm having a hard time figuring out.. what action exists in this plugin that I can use
[15:35:08] <shoky> also, this callback doesn't only happen when you click next/previous
[15:35:26] <LindsayM_> shoky:  it also happens when you use the arrows or swipe..
[15:35:33] <shoky> or just by itself if you wait
[15:35:55] <LindsayM_> hm/?
[15:36:45] <shoky> if you wait and dont do anything, it goes to the next slide
[15:36:53] <shoky> assuming you have no errors in your callback
[15:37:45] <LindsayM_> yes...
[15:38:05] <LindsayM_> shoky:  again.. it just happens when the slides change. That is what before is and that is when I want to change the url
[15:38:27] <LindsayM_> does this make sense? Can you see what i'm trying to achieve? I want to basically update the URL so I can deep link to a slide
[15:38:45] <robertmaxrees> use pushstates.
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> or hashes
[15:39:03] <LindsayM_> robertmaxrees: i am.. i am just stuck on how to access the events in the flexslider plugin that I need to
[15:39:28] <LindsayM_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/jg656orh/3/
[15:40:26] <Scriptonaut> should I be using attr or prop
[15:40:31] <robertmaxrees> prop() most of the time.
[15:40:47] <Scriptonaut> so they don't do the same thing
[15:40:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:41:16] <robertmaxrees> LindsayM_ you have the callbacks - that should work, then.
[15:41:34] <LindsayM_> robertmaxrees: so what am I doing wrong here?
[15:41:45] <robertmaxrees> what is "href" supposed to be?
[15:42:01] <robertmaxrees> oh i see.
[15:42:09] <LindsayM_> the href is wrong.. so please ignore that. AS I had said before, i was originally trying to trigger link click and then I realized I was wrong
[15:42:21] <robertmaxrees> this.dataset isn't what you think it is in that case.
[15:42:34] <shoky> LindsayM_ just looking at the argument you can find some stuff you can use if you want.. http://jsfiddle.net/jg656orh/4/
[15:42:38] <LindsayM_> right.. shoky and I have basically established this.
[15:42:44] <robertmaxrees> sorry, just got in sooo.
[15:43:15] <LindsayM_> robertmaxrees: its ok. I'm trying to get you up on it if you'r einterested
[15:43:23] <LindsayM_> realize that might have sounded snobbier than it was meant to be
[15:43:32] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[15:44:50] <LindsayM_> shoky:  i have kind of gotten that far but still, my lack of skill in js gets my stuck here
[15:45:09] <shoky> LindsayM_:  and here's example of how to get the id of the slide  http://jsfiddle.net/jg656orh/5/
[15:47:30] <LindsayM_> shoky: okthats helpful
[15:53:11] <mAxX--> so why is this happening http://jsfiddle.net/54pz8/42/
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[15:55:47] <mAxX--> robertmaxrees: im geeting each value repeated more than once
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> right - for (i in val) {}
[15:56:28] <robertmaxrees> for every one of those, output that string.
[15:56:34] <mAxX--> robertmaxrees: not happening when i do console.log(val.points);
[15:56:58] <robertmaxrees> happening for me in that for look.
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> *loop
[15:57:29] <mAxX--> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/54pz8/43/
[15:57:31] <mAxX--> loo
[15:57:33] <mAxX--> look
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> each of those is repeating for me.
[15:58:05] <robertmaxrees> in multiples of 8.
[15:58:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/54pz8/44/
[15:58:21] <robertmaxrees> is this what you want?
[15:59:38] <mAxX--> robert_: yes thought i should be seeing the same as in the console
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> that was weird.
[16:01:55] <mAxX--> yes
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> my connection at work dropped.
[16:15:00] <LindsayM_> ugh I think i need to walk away from this. I just dont know where my head is at
[16:15:57] <LindsayM_> flexslider is so my favorite slider out there but I am so confused by it~
[16:25:22] <adamellsworth> does anyone know why jquery draggable won't allow elements to be dragged to before their current position when they're in the middle of the parent?
[16:26:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm?  "before"?
[16:27:15] <adamellsworth> yeah, essentially backward from it's initial position
[16:28:01] <adamellsworth> atm it's only able to go forward until the end of the containment (parent)
[16:28:15] <robertmaxrees> "forward" is ephemeral.  can you show us what you mean?
[16:29:18] <adamellsworth> oh boy
[16:29:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:30:45] <jim_j> hi
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> long story short, unless you're bounding it somehow, there shouldn't anything preventing it.
[16:31:00] <jim_j> how do you move one div and its content into another div after the page has loaded?
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> jim_j .append() or .appendTo()
[16:31:28] <jim_j> thanks
[16:31:53] <adamellsworth> oh nevermind. It's because I'm not removing the 'margin-left' attribute they get when initially created
[16:31:55] <adamellsworth> :P
[16:32:23] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[16:40:23] <superNoob_> hi, there is a way to add conditional ternary on slide effect like this (this one doesn t seen to work, and I don t know why)
[16:40:24] <superNoob_> $(".el").effect('slide', { direction: goNext ? 'left' : 'right', mode: 'hide' }, 500)
[16:43:00] <robertmaxrees> what is "gonext" supposed to be?
[16:43:17] <superNoob_> true or false
[16:44:10] <robertmaxrees> might need to wrap parents around those - direction: (goNext ? 'left' : 'right')
[16:44:11] <Primero> somebody know how use ace?
[16:46:51] <Primero> I have problem loading code into ace, using js
[16:46:53] <robertmaxrees> superNoob_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7dm7bava/1/
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[16:48:31] <superNoob_> yeah, sorry it s 'my' goNext
[16:49:09] <robertmaxrees> the variable wrong?
[16:49:12] <superNoob_> yeah
[16:49:18] <robertmaxrees> ah, there you go then.
[16:49:22] <superNoob_> yeah
[16:49:27] <superNoob_> a bit strange
[16:49:33] <superNoob_> but thx
[17:01:40] <robertmaxrees> lol NaN
[17:01:49] <wodim> so funny
[19:06:34] <kevireilly> is $('#elem').find('.child') more performant than $('#elem .child') or something? Trying to figure out why webstorm suggests against the latter
[19:07:34] <BillCriswell> kevireilly: I have no idea why it would suggest the second one.
[19:07:50] <kevireilly> BillCriswell: other way, it suggests against the second one
[19:08:02] <kevireilly> doesn't suggest the first one, just suggests that the second is in inefficient
[19:08:04] <BillCriswell> I meant to type wouldn't lol
[19:08:13] <kevireilly> oh ok haha
[19:08:17] <kevireilly> so we're equally confused
[19:08:19] <BillCriswell> $('#elem .child') can be done in one querySelectorAll, the other couldn't.
[19:08:23] <BillCriswell> kevireilly: Yes.
[19:08:42] <kevireilly> everything I knew about jquery is a lie! lol
[19:09:05] <BillCriswell> The first one would be two calls to querySelectorAll... or maybe one to getElementById and another to getElementsByClassName...
[19:09:05] <IceTrAiN> is there a way to do a diff/compare between different versions of a jsbin/jsfiddle?
[19:09:11] <BillCriswell> too lazy to look it up.
[19:09:43] <kevireilly> BillCriswell: yeah I can see where you're headed with that logic
[19:13:57] <BillCriswell> kevireilly: http://jsperf.com/quickstupidtest not sure if I did this right but worth a look.
[19:14:15] <kevireilly> good name
[19:14:47] <kevireilly> innnteresting
[19:15:35] <BillCriswell> Indeed.. but I'm not sure if that's what jQuer is actually doing lol
[19:16:04] <kevireilly> le hrm http://24ways.org/2011/your-jquery-now-with-less-suck/
[19:16:07] <BillCriswell> kevireilly: plus you have to add in the calls to $() and .find() themselves...
[19:16:49] <BillCriswell> Oh... I was right. Weird.
[19:17:49] <BillCriswell> Not a bad little article here.
[19:18:01] <kevireilly> yeah my nips are a lil hard
[19:18:13] <kevireilly> webstorm hasn't steered me wrong before, not sure why it'd start here
[19:18:22] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[19:18:52] <kevireilly> Thanks for your feedback BillCriswell, much appreciated
[19:18:57] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:31:00] <desophos> is it possible to have a jQuery.noConflict() and an unsafeWindow.jQuery.noConflict() in two different vars in the same function?
[19:31:37] <desophos> that is, can i use jQuery.noConflict() multiple times in the same context?
[19:41:36] <desophos> nope, apparently it doesn't work like that
[20:06:41] <c2c> desophos:  what do you call an "unsafeWindow.jQuery.noConflict" ?
[20:07:47] <desophos> c2c: $jq_unsafe
[20:07:52] <desophos> if that's what you're asking
[20:07:56] <adamellsworth> can someone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/zswQM9HQ
[20:08:13] <adamellsworth> on line 11 _markerid is still an empty string
[20:08:17] <desophos> but it turns out using unsafeWindow isn't the answer anyway
[20:10:05] <adamellsworth> nvm, figured it out
[20:10:31] <adamellsworth> wrapped the popover within the click event funciton
[20:11:27] <Technical_13> Where might I find documentation on how to do $.when.apply( $, listOfPromises )?
[20:15:20] <gtristan> I'm getting some weird webkit glitch...
[20:15:50] <gtristan> so... on other browsers, when I do: var overflow = $(element).css ('overflow-y')
[20:15:58] <gtristan> then overflow === 'scroll'
[20:16:22] <gtristan> for exactly the same web page on webkit... overflow === null
[20:16:41] <gtristan> any ideas whats up with that ?
[20:17:14] <gtristan> the overflow-y:scroll is set on a class which is applied to the dom element in question
[20:57:01] <Technical_13> Can someone help me to get my userInfo() function to return the data before my .done( function() {     /* show result */     console.info( mlmInfo ); } ) is called in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Technical_13/Scripts/UpdateMailingList.js
[21:04:06] <desophos> i realize i might get skewed answers here, but does using jQuery have a performance impact? should i avoid using it for simple things that could be done without it, like document.querySelector() instead of $()?
[21:04:31] <desophos> or should i be consistent and always use jQuery, even for things that could easily be done with native JS?
[21:04:46] <sdwrage> Hey all, does anyone know of a jquery plugin geared towards bootstrap 3 that toggles a collapsable grid column?
[21:05:06] <sdwrage> one column is currently the sidebar and the other is the main content
[21:14:40] <gtristan> desophos, opinion is that your code will read better if you consistently use jQuery APIs
[21:15:40] <gtristan> desophos, to be honest I've only been using jquery for around 6 months, and I do not use selectors at all, but I enjoy the benefits of the cross-browser support :)
[21:15:55] <desophos> hmm, okay
[21:16:26] <gtristan> whatever performance impacts you might be worried about though, should be addressed by not making too many needless selectors
[21:17:23] <gtristan> i.e. never do: $('complex selector').func(); $('complex selector again').func(); ... instead do $result = $('selector'); ... reuse the result where possible
[21:17:57] <desophos> right
[21:48:40] <lxsameer> hey guys, does using find on an element to select several elements in loop has better performance to do the same thing but without find ?
[23:13:58] <Cork> lxsameer: if you mean basing the find from a closer parent then document speed things up: yes
