[00:31:39] <NitroLiq> Anyone awake?
[00:48:18] <tash> is there some special way of getting the value of what someone typed in an <input type="text" id="initials91787"> box?  FYI, in this case the number is dynamic.  I've tried $('#initials'+id).val(); and I've tried $('#initials91787').val(); but it is just coming back undefined
[00:48:53] <tash> the action is being taken after someone types something int he box, the clicks a button.  Not on keyup or anything like that.
[01:07:17] <tash> I put together a fiddle, can someone look? https://jsfiddle.net/L7b6bbzz/2/
[01:07:48] <tash> for any one of those complete buttons, I want to get the value of the Initials text box.  My console.log for that is just saying undefined
[01:20:45] <tash> dang, have tried several other things, anyone around?
[01:46:48] <tash> https://jsfiddle.net/yqyLke3m/2/ Why does this return [object Object] ?  I want to get the value of what I'm typing
[03:21:02] <suexec> I have an .on('input' on a #element. I do some ajax validation and based on the result, I either leave the field alone or try to empty it by doing $("#element").val("");. The .val("") does NOT work for this one field - but for all other fields. What could be causing that ?
[03:21:29] <suexec> ah screw it
[03:21:34] <suexec> brain fart could be causing it
[03:24:23] <aro> is there a way to detect with jquery when elements are added to a node?
[03:24:39] <aro> like i have a <select> element, id like to trigger a callback if there is an <option> added
[04:12:41] <thevishy> is it possible to use jQuery by supplying the DOM?
[04:12:55] <thevishy> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-elements-when-i-already-have-a-dom-element/ talks about selecting
[04:13:03] <thevishy> but I also wanted to other operations
[04:14:31] <thevishy> lets say add an element
[05:21:57] <thevishy> what function does jQuery call when you do jQuery("<div></div>")
[05:22:26] <thevishy> I mean I wanted to create an element like that but on a different DOM?
[05:22:48] <thevishy> perhaps I could just not worry about the DOM during creation time
[05:24:05] <VictorCL> jQuery(".element").html("<div></div>");
[05:24:47] <VictorCL> jQuery(".element").append("<div></div>");
[05:24:56] <VictorCL> jQuery(".element").prepend("<div></div>");
[05:24:58] <VictorCL> many ways
[05:25:04] <VictorCL> depending on what you want to achive
[05:25:56] <thevishy> VictorCL: is it fine to do this -> a = jQuery("<div></div>") // expecting to create a standalone div that is not attached to anything and then jQuery(iframe_document).append(a)
[05:26:08] <VictorCL> yes
[05:26:16] <thevishy> ok that is pretty sweet I think
[05:26:42] <thevishy> looks like I am a fan of jQuery already
[05:26:56] <VictorCL> jquery is pretty flexible
[05:27:08] <VictorCL> like slax0r mom
[05:27:17] <thevishy> yeah its really nice to know, I mean in these days of Angular etc, people are moving towards that for business apps
[05:27:36] <thevishy> but jQuery is pretty solid in its capabilities and worth learning in depth
[05:29:24] <thevishy> its almost as if it has its own existense but more for apps that have vareity of DOM manipulaion logics
[05:29:30] <thevishy> and not just forms
[05:32:13] <drej> the way i overly generalize it is
[05:32:17] <drej> angular/react == web apps
[05:32:19] <drej> jquery == websites
[05:33:47] <thevishy> okay yes it makes a lot of sense, I will learn more of jQuery, love the way it abstracts a lot of things
[05:34:30] <thevishy> jQuery objets do have to have a context dom always?
[05:35:05] <thevishy> like is it fundamentally tied up to a DOM (with root element)
[06:19:09] <jerit> so I found this but I'm not sure I understand it properly enough to use it
[06:19:10] <jerit> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/get-url-variables/
[06:20:08] <jerit> On loading the page, I want to check whether or not a querystring value exists. If it doesn't, return without doing anything, if it does, execute an AJAX post with that info
[06:34:10] <kostasx> jerit, you probably need something like this? http://codepen.io/kostasx/pen/dMJEZw?editors=0010&pony=hurray
[06:36:30] <Tobbi> How do I get a string of the text of all .commit-id elements concatenated together with " "?
[06:38:15] <Uhkis> var texts = []; $('.commit-id').each(function() { texts.push($(this).text()); }); var text = texts.join(' ');
[06:40:20] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[06:42:28] <Tobbi> Sometimes I really feel like an idiot.
[08:06:11] <km4> hi
[08:06:33] <km4> I have a problem with e.target element
[08:14:36] <Woet> ok
[08:25:48] <km4> https://codepen.io/km4/pen/EKozBd how can I use e.target for hide the changelog window if click witchout this div ?
[08:35:37] <Devrim> Is it possible to capture and set an URL/XHR based on a regex as a variable?
[08:36:12] <Devrim> So GET requests are sent out and based on regex are filtered and set as a variable
[08:37:02] <drej> sure, bind an event to all anchors
[08:37:08] <drej> parse the href value of said anchor
[08:37:14] <drej> match it against regexp
[08:37:19] <drej> do whatever you want, else do something else
[08:39:15] <Devrim> drej the requests are AJAX requests, don't think I can create anchors or I am missing something
[08:39:34] <drej> how are you makign said requests, what is the behaviour that triggers them?
[08:39:37] <Devrim> Also I don't have control over the page, I'm just building an extension around it
[08:39:58] <drej> i mean jquery works mostly based on binding events on to dom elements so you have to have some sort of understanding there
[08:40:08] <drej> unless you want to hijack all xhr requests and try to do it that way
[08:40:13] <drej> but it'll quickly become sloppy i feel
[08:40:54] <Devrim> Clicking on a picture triggers the AJAX request
[08:41:25] <drej> are you building yet another lightbox plugin? :)
[08:41:48] <Devrim> Nah, building a video player around a site that requires Flash for HTML5 streams >.>
[08:42:18] <Devrim> But I haven't found a reliable way to acquire the streaming files because tokens are generated and everything is behind a login
[08:42:27] <drej> oh, my condolences
[08:42:43] <Devrim> If I can capture the XHR request I can generate the streaming files (m3u playlist)
[08:43:11] <Devrim> The site only makes a few XHR request so maybe capturing all XHR requests is the way to do it
[09:02:19] <aro> is there a way to make a json object with a null key appear in front of numeric indexes?
[09:02:27] <aro> in this case: Object {131: "Andorra la Vella", 132: "Canillo", 133: "Encamp", 134: "Escaldes-Engordany", 135: "La Massana", 136: "Ordino", 137: "Sant Julià de Lòria", "": "No Region Selected"}
[09:02:35] <aro> i want the no region selected to appear at the front
[09:13:46] <decx> that's not valid json
[09:14:01] <decx> not an object either
[09:26:01] <km4> https://codepen.io/km4/pen/EKozBd how can I use e.target for hide the changelog window if click witchout this div ?
[09:48:14] <aro> according to jsonlint it is
[09:51:29] <aro> {"_":"No Region Selected","684":"Alberta","685":"British Columbia","686":"Manitoba","687":"New Brunswick","688":"Newfoundland and Labrador","689":"Northwest Territories","690":"Nova Scotia","691":"Nunavut","692":"Ontario","693":"Prince Edward Island","694":"Quebec","695":"Saskatchewan","696":"Yukon Territory"}
[09:51:39] <aro> that keeps rendering the key with _ at the end
[09:51:50] <decx> well apparently a string with length 0 IS okay
[09:52:30] <aro> i just cant get it to parse it and keep the order
[09:53:26] <shoky> aro: object keys aren't ordered, if you need to order the keys you can get the array of keys with Object.keys(obj) and sort it however you want
[09:53:42] <aro> let me try that
[09:53:55] <shoky> that won't give you an object with ordered keys tho
[09:54:02] <shoky> just an array
[09:55:54] <aro> so now that gives me, ["4660", "4661", "4662", "4663", "4664", "4665", "4666", "4667", "4668", "4669", "4670", "4671", "4672", "4673", "4674", "4675", "4676", "4677", "4678", "4679", "4680", "4681", "4682", "4683", "4684", "4685", "4686", "4687", "4688", "4689", "4690", "4691", "4692", "4693", "4694", "4695", "4696", "4697", "4698", "4699", "4700", "4701", "4702", "4703", "4704", "4705", "4706",
[09:55:54] <aro> "4707", "4708", "4709", "4710", "4711", "4712", "4713", "4714", "4715", "4716", ""]
[09:56:00] <aro> how do i get that "" to appear at the beginning?
[09:56:42] <shoky> you'd need to sort it with your own custom sort function
[09:56:57] <decx> km4: !$(e.target).closest(dialog).length will be outside
[09:57:22] <shoky> aro: or well, just call .sort() on it ;p
[10:27:39] <user12345> Hello iam trying to setup an select Field (#tasks_id) depending on the value of another Selectfield (#project_id). Iam using jQuery, which seems to work genrally but whtaever iam trying in console i cant get the selected Value of #project_id. the whole relevant sourcecode can be found here: http://pastebin.com/W7cqESRZ there are no errors thrown in console. Maybe someon has an idea?
[10:39:07] <pjfl> user12345 the server is working properly
[10:39:28] <pjfl> i dont recive any response. it looks the php file have same errors
[10:39:50] <pjfl> or you are blocking exernal ips
[10:43:14] <pjfl> user12345 your code is correct
[10:43:36] <pjfl> the response of server need to be something like this  <option = "1">test</option><option = "1">test2</option><option = "1">test3</option>
[10:44:08] <pjfl> and the complete js shoud be like this  $('#task_id').html('<option = "1">test</option><option = "1">test2</option><option = "1">test3</option>');
[10:46:13] <pjfl> @user12345
[10:46:43] <decx> too late yo
[10:52:14] <Uhkis> maybe better that way since that html is broken
[11:41:23] <momomo> is there a good reason as to why jquery will serialize an array on options.data.args = ['a', 'b'] .. to a params called 'args''
[11:41:27] <momomo> is there a good reason as to why jquery will serialize an array on options.data.args = ['a', 'b'] .. to a params called 'args[]'
[11:41:31] <momomo> on the server ?
[11:42:32] <momomo> the post bcomes: args[]	
[11:42:32] <momomo> a
[11:42:32] <momomo> args[]	
[11:42:32] <momomo> b
[11:46:27] <momomo> it should be args=a&args=b
[11:48:15] <shoky> momomo: you can set "traditional" option to true and i think it'll do it the way you want
[11:48:28] <shoky> (for $.ajax or $.param)
[11:49:09] <momomo> shoky, thanks, that just costed me 40 minutes
[11:49:20] <momomo> wtf is that anyway .. why break all kind of servers
[11:49:35] <shoky> because the other way can break other kinds of servers ;p
[11:49:44] <momomo> traditional should be default to be true
[11:49:49] <shoky> so you say
[11:49:57] <momomo> to stay backwards compatible
[11:50:08] <momomo> i am sure new servers are backwards format compatible
[11:50:15] <momomo> if that's the new format
[11:50:59] <shoky> servers can parse it however they want to. i'm guessing the non-traditional way is more common these days which is why that's the default
[11:51:08] <shoky> you're welcome to disagree :)
[11:51:24] <momomo> shoky, i am on latest version of tomcat
[11:51:29] <momomo> and it did not recognize that
[11:51:35] <shoky> so?
[11:51:38] <shoky> that's tomcat.
[11:51:45] <shoky> not "all kind of servers"
[11:52:24] <momomo> i am just saying .. tradional should be default not to break funciotnality .. if "newer" versions add this syntax, i am sure they would continue to support the old syntax too
[11:52:43] <shoky> ok ;p
[11:54:21] <shoky> i just send json, fwiw
[11:54:25] <momomo> shoky, i am not even sure this is some standard
[11:54:27] <momomo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[11:54:31] <momomo> seems to be jquery stuff
[11:54:53] <shoky> well yes we're talking about jquery..
[11:55:33] <shoky> and $.ajax just uses $.param, yes
[11:55:34] <momomo> so jqueyr introduced some new format and standard that server implementors now have to abide by .. this is crazy
[11:55:42] <shoky> eh, it's not jquery that introduced it
[11:55:43] <shoky> get over it
[11:56:00] <momomo> i cna't find a reference to this being a new format
[11:56:06] <shoky> it's a very common way to serialize arrays in query/post params
[11:56:17] <shoky> i'm pretty sure e.g. php reads that fine
[11:57:14] <shoky> they even say it, sort of:  As of jQuery 1.4, the $.param() method serializes deep objects recursively to accommodate modern scripting languages and frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails.
[11:57:40] <shoky> not talking specifically about arrays but it's the same reasons
[11:58:01] <shoky> and they explicitly say:  For best compatibility across versions, call $.param() with an explicit value for the second argument and do not use defaults.
[11:58:54] <shoky> and:
[11:58:55] <shoky> Note: Because there is no universally agreed-upon specification for param strings, it is not possible to encode complex data structures using this method in a manner that works ideally across all languages supporting such input. Use JSON format as an alternative for encoding complex data instead.
[11:59:21] <shoky> jquery have better things to do than make up their own serialization format :P
[11:59:43] <momomo> yes, and still they just did
[11:59:50] <momomo> and broke my jee server
[11:59:51] <shoky> no, they did not.
[11:59:59] <momomo> dude
[12:00:02] <momomo> what are you not getting
[12:00:07] <momomo> it has worked for the past 10 years
[12:00:10] <momomo> now it doesnt
[12:00:25] <momomo> they broke implementations that follow and abide by some rules ...
[12:00:32] <momomo> but thanks for your help
[12:00:42] <momomo> and the new syntax doesnt add anything
[12:00:44] <shoky> they changed it to what is more common so it is more useful to more people.
[12:00:51] <momomo> it just makes the args param unreadable
[12:00:57] <momomo> now i ahave to read it on server as
[12:00:58] <shoky> and they did it in a major version a long time ago
[12:00:59] <momomo> args[]
[12:01:01] <shoky> so there's no problem.
[12:01:25] <shoky> they gave an option to use the old format, all good. let's move on
[12:01:46] <momomo> long time ago, since 1.8
[12:02:17] <momomo> yes
[12:04:48] <shoky> also i'm pretty sure you can easily get tomcat to use the [] format
[12:05:08] <shoky> request.getParameterValues("args[]")   or something
[12:08:47] <momomo> shoky, yes, if i call it that way ..  but for that i would have to change all existing code whereever that is used, and relies on getting an array
[12:09:26] <momomo> and i think the old format was just fine
[12:09:58] <shoky> upgrading major versions of libraries you use usually means you need to change some code. jquery did nothing special here. plus here you have the choice of doing it on client or on server
[12:10:39] <shoky> well it doesnt usually mean it, but it does mean it in many cases, and is something that is your responsiblity to take care of
[12:11:01] <shoky> if you don't want to change anything,  keep the old version
[12:50:00] <tash> https://jsfiddle.net/yqyLke3m/2/ How can I get the value of what I type in, rather than [object Object] ?
[12:52:20] <shoky> tash:  you want  .val()  not .val("")
[12:54:05] <tash> sigh, I tried so many different things and overlooked that
[12:54:37] <tash> now, this was a very simple test. I have another fiddle that is slightly more complicated. I'm going to apply that syntax there and see if it works.
[12:55:32] <tash> actually before I do change anything in that one, I'll share the fiddle here and explain. https://jsfiddle.net/L7b6bbzz/2/
[12:55:53] <tash> I want to type some initials and click the Complete button, but if you look in the console it is undefined
[12:56:07] <tash> but I'm setting the variable for fabInitials the same way I am for fabSelect
[12:58:06] <shoky> tash: no idea what you want us to do with that fiddle, but you should look at line 43  ;p
[12:59:21] <shoky> you really shouldn't be using id's for all this stuff,  and definitely not duplicate id's
[13:01:10] <shoky> also you have bad id's for all those initials inputs
[13:01:53] <tash> sigh
[13:01:55] <tash> now I see it
[13:02:19] <tash> I guess I don't know any better than to use id's for all this stuff =\
[13:02:43] <shoky> use classes, and maybe also data-* attributes
[13:03:24] <shoky> and don't select stuff in the click handlers by id, but rather something like e.g.   $(this).closest('tr').find('.initials')
[13:03:53] <tash> so that looks in the current tr for initials right?
[13:03:58] <shoky> yep
[13:04:11] <shoky> for element with "intials" class, that is
[13:05:06] <tash> so, in this case where I have rows that have similar data ... I could give my inputs the same class without worrying about appending something to the end like I'm doing now?  Like "initials"+id
[13:05:07] <tash> right?
[13:05:20] <tash> sorry, new concept for me, want to make sure I understand before I try applying
[13:05:32] <shoky> right
[13:05:36] <tash> and use $(this).closest, ah cool
[13:05:38] <tash> thanks a lot
[13:05:43] <shoky> np
[13:05:57] <tash> I'm going to have to rewrite a bunch :)
[13:06:05] <tash> but guess I have to start somewhere
[13:13:01] <tash> cool, got it to work...thanks again shoky, this makes much more sense to me as far as finding values of elements without having to rig a way to append an id or something to everything
[14:35:23] <jerit> is it possible to create a jquery function that uses parameters having default values like one can in C#?
[15:41:16] <robhol> in ES6, sure. Otherwise I think the "standard" JS way (incidentally a hilarious phrase) is to just use || (similar to how ?? is used in C#)
[15:42:24] <robhol> it's also been available before that, but not officially in ES5, I don't think.

[16:15:17] <m_jimmer> Hello all I am kinda new to web frameworks. Coming from a C++ background.  I am wondering how I can stop repetitive coding in html.  Example: I was using load() to load in things like nav bars and footers and other things that are needed on each page.  But when I refresh the browser it goes back to index.html.  Is there re-writes for url or better ways ?
[16:19:25] <m_jimmer> like can I have a header.html , nav.html , footer.html and load them in to each page so that I do not have to add that and make the code look cleaner and less coding.  also using many reusable "Elements"    Like I want to load in functions that load "Elements"
