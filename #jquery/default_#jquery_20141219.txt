[00:02:38] <Kartagis> oh, there is no .once
[00:09:47] <Kartagis> I have a problem
[00:10:11] <Kartagis> I've been using Drupal and I have a view on the front page
[00:10:35] <Kartagis> I load //code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js in my theme
[00:11:08] <Kartagis> it loads, but the view disappears
[00:11:21] <Kartagis> it responds to clicks though
[00:11:27] <Kartagis> any ideas?
[00:15:26] <Uhkis> check browsers console
[00:20:01] <Kartagis> nothing in console

[00:23:40] <slax0r> I need to draw a pretty large image on canvas, about 3500x3500 pixels, with zoom, I am worried about performance...is canvas the right way to go, or would webgl be better?
[00:37:32] <stangeland> if i have a variable with a filename and an array with valid fileextensions, is there some easy way to quickly check if the file has a valid extension?

[00:56:47] <tobago> is there a way to list all observed functions?
[01:09:26] <shanee> Hello. I was hoping to have an  item on the page grow and shrink smoothly based on real-time data updated every few seconds. Ideally I'd take 5 points on a graph. Connect them smoothly with curves and then transition this. However it seems that CSS transition cannot really do this (?). Is there a library for jQuery or something or will I have to write this myself?
[01:13:48] <sahbeewah> shanee: how is the item that is being grown/shrunk related to the graph with points
[01:14:43] <Agen_Terminator> Hi guys
[01:15:18] <shanee> sahbeewah, I would like the graph to be time/size of item.
[01:16:13] <shanee> sahbeewah, So I would like the item to follow the size of the graph.
[01:16:55] <shanee> sahbeewah, Does that make sense?
[01:18:53] <sahbeewah> you can do that with css transitions and/or .animate
[01:19:56] <sahbeewah> what’s confusing you
[01:20:09] <Agen_Terminator> Question for anyone kind enough.
[01:20:09] <Agen_Terminator> I've replaced a div using .html(data), which works great. A bunch of data is retrieved and put into new hidden input elements. Now I want to get the value using js or jquery on the page of those hidden inputs, but the browsers claim the id doesn't exist/is null when using document.getElementById(f_name).value; for example. I'm guessing the DOM isn't updating or something? I've tried set time out and content and dom co
[01:22:43] <prohobo> Agen_Terminator: fiddle!
[01:22:53] <prohobo> or show some code
[01:23:19] <prohobo> are the generated elements in the source code of the page when you inspect it?
[01:23:49] <prohobo> if you can't find those hidden elements with browser inspection tools
[01:23:55] <prohobo> then they aren't being added to the DOM
[01:24:15] <prohobo> other than that, all i can think of is you using the wrong selectors for f_name
[01:27:57] <shanee> sahbeewah, It's really hard to make a curve for a css transition that connects 3 points smoothly. I don't think it's possible to connect more than 3 points smoothly with css transitions? So I'll have to use jQuery to reset the transition to the next points all the time? Is that right? I was kind of hoping someone might have done most of this hard work for me. :P
[01:28:59] <shanee> Agen_Terminator, .html(data) will set the html within that element. However .value can get text written within a text box etc normally(?)
[01:29:17] <shanee> To get data set with .html(data) just do .html() to get it back.
[01:29:58] <shanee> Be warned. Chrome may change the html you set to be slightly different (but still valid). For example it may remove or change whitespace etc or add missing closing tags.
[01:30:08] <shanee> So it's normally not a good way to store data.
[01:30:23] <shanee> Instead consider using .data("namehere", data)
[01:30:30] <shanee> Or what do you need the data for?
[01:30:30] <Agen_Terminator> I can indeed find my data in the inspector
[01:30:32] <Kartagis> Uhkis: nothing in console
[01:30:46] <Agen_Terminator> I'll fiddle if necessary, but there's a lot of junk in there too that I thought it might confuse the issue
[01:31:20] <shanee> Agen_Terminator, What do you store the value in? $("div").html or $("input").html  ?
[01:31:24] <Agen_Terminator> lemme catch  up with sugggestions, two secs
[01:37:15] * gtristan wishes there was never any .appendTo() method
[01:37:32] <sahbeewah> shanee: yeah you’ll have to use jquery to reset the transition all the time. and by real time it’ll have to be at least a point behind because you’ll need to know at least a point ahead to be able to make a smooth curve
[01:37:43] <sahbeewah> not really a typical use case, can’t see a jquery plugin to have been created for it
[01:37:55] <sahbeewah> perhaps look into d3.js
[01:40:26] <shanee> sahbeewah, Yeah. That's OK, I can stay at least a point behind. I've used d3 a little before but was never too impressed (if you try do something non-standard with it it seems to more trouble than it is worth).
[01:42:18] <shanee> sahbeewah, I don't suppose that you know the maths to generate the graph formula that would connect two points smoothly?
[01:44:43] <Agen_Terminator> The data being set is the whole div, which contains basically an html section with hidden inputs (which don't exist until this) that are figured out from an ajax call to a php file that generates the html for the div. I am setting a div called hidden-info with $("#hidden-info").html(e); which loads the generated inputs a list of <input type="hidden" name="f_name" id="f_name" value="example">.  Getting a value of one o
[01:44:43] <Agen_Terminator> I'm making my jsfiddle this now, I know reading like this can be a pain haha
[01:45:32] <shanee> And you're trying to get the value from one of the hidden inputs?
[01:45:42] <Agen_Terminator> yeah, that's right
[01:46:01] <shanee> try $("#f_name").val()
[01:46:04] <sahbeewah> shanee: nop my math sucks. but you’re looking for a bezier curve through x points, probably do some google/reading on that
[01:46:15] <shanee> possibly also try with the underscore. As I can't remember if you can use those in an id.
[01:46:40] <Agen_Terminator> You beautiful person!
[01:46:53] <Agen_Terminator> That works!
[01:47:11] <Kartagis> sooooooooooooo
[01:47:15] <Kartagis> I need help
[01:47:23] <Kartagis> I've been using Drupal and I have a view on the front page
[01:47:30] <shanee> Agen_Terminator, Awesome. :)
[01:47:33] <Kartagis> I load //code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js in my theme
[01:47:43] <Kartagis> it loads, but the view disappears
[01:47:43] <shanee> sahbeewah, Thank you. I'm looking into that now. Still, this should be an interesting project.
[01:47:47] <shanee> Thank you for your help.
[01:47:48] <Kartagis> it responds to clicks though
[01:47:56] <Agen_Terminator> Thanks so much for your help. I was pulling my hair out!
[01:50:13] <shanee> Kartagis, Not really enough information I'm afraid. Are there any errors on the console? Could you provide an example on jsfiddle?
[01:51:15] <Kartagis> shanee: I'm afraid I can't provide. because what actually works on jsfiddle doesn't work on my website
[01:51:34] <Kartagis> no errors in console though
[01:53:47] <Kartagis> argh
[01:53:57] <Kartagis> I got it
[01:54:25] <Kartagis> there was a class named hidden with the opacity:0
[01:54:27] <Kartagis> damn
[01:56:15] <shanee> Kartagis, Ah. That's strange. Why was that being made?
[01:56:29] <shanee> Anyway, glad you managed to get to the bottom of it.
[01:59:22] <Kartagis> shanee: this company made the website, but they did a lot of things not by the book
[01:59:53] <Kartagis> like hacking core modules instead of rolling their on module etc
[02:01:15] <Uhkis> Kartagis: burn it with fire!
[02:01:53] <Kartagis> burn what?
[02:02:35] <Uhkis> core hacked site of course
[02:03:58] <carnau> I have 2 arrays: myArray1 = ["one", "two"] and myArray2 = ["hello", "world"]. Is there any function that merges both arrays and return myArray3 = [ "one" => "hello", "two" => "world"]? (not sure about if this is a correct syntax for this type of array)
[02:04:04] <Kartagis> heh
[02:04:13] <Kartagis> then I'd be out of work
[02:04:25] <Kartagis> (besides my daily job)
[02:11:15] <shanee> carnau, I think you can use $.map. https://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[02:11:57] <carnau> shanee, will try, thank you
[02:12:39] <shanee> carnau, Actually. Ignore that. Maybe not. In that case it might not be possible easily.
[02:12:46] <shanee> I could write a function for it?
[02:14:09] <carnau> Don't worry, I will serialize the data. It will work for my purpose.
[02:14:30] <carnau> In case .map() don't fit my needs
[02:24:14] <shanee> carnau, Map might be more trouble than it's worth here. Hopefully this is correct? http://jsfiddle.net/rcas51hb/
[02:27:32] <carnau> shanee, Yeah, that is perfect! Many thanks :-)
[03:05:26] <Xatenev> Heya guys, one fast question, anybody got a clue how I can get the height of a text element?
[03:05:36] <Xatenev> for example I got a p tag which has a height of 0 at the moment
[03:05:46] <Xatenev> and I wanna know how much height is needed to show all its content
[03:14:01] <Xatenev> No idea?:[^^
[03:15:41] <DevAntoine> hi
[03:15:54] <DevAntoine> I dont understand why this code works under Chrome but not under Firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/ku26kaq3/
[03:23:06] <Xatenev> DevAntoine: weird lol
[03:23:58] <Xatenev> somehow tableProductTemplate.html() is just empty when u set it
[03:23:58] <Xatenev> xO
[04:24:09] <DevAntoine> Xatenev: yeah, really weird!
[04:24:15] <DevAntoine> I dont understand why this code works under Chrome but not under Firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/ku26kaq3/
[04:33:25] <Uhkis> firefox doesn't like <script type="text/html">
[04:35:29] <DevAntoine> Uhkis: wow
[04:36:38] <Uhkis> maybe because html isn't script ;)
[04:37:24] <stampz> is this the chan for jquery mobile ?
[04:40:00] <DevAntoine> Uhkis: I don't understand, icanhaz is using it too: http://icanhazjs.com/
[04:42:18] <john-dev> if i set an iframes height to lets say 1000px, how is is possible that $( document ).height(); returns 1000px instead of the real documents size?
[04:43:53] <DevAntoine> Uhkis: you're sure the issue is caused by the type's value?
[04:43:54] <Uhkis> DevAntoine: weird, .text() works fine
[04:44:41] <Uhkis> did jsfiddle just die?
[04:47:54] <Uhkis> DevAntoine: http://jsfiddle.net/ku26kaq3/1/ i think you might've found a bug in jquery
[04:51:01] <DevAntoine> Uhkis: I'm not sure if it's related to jQuery considering it works under Chrome
[04:52:11] <DevAntoine> I guess I'll just replace this script tag with a hidden div :(
[04:52:58] <Uhkis> well jquery is supposed to be supported by major browser and in this case, it isn't
[04:53:01] <Uhkis> sounds like a bug to me!
[04:54:28] <Xatenev> Rly weird issue
[04:54:28] <Xatenev> Lol
[04:54:38] <Xatenev> Maybe Cork knows whats going on? :P
[04:54:41] <Xatenev> #mightycork
[04:56:25] <DevAntoine> hum, if I replace script by div it doesn't work either oO
[04:56:52] <DevAntoine> it only prints the input with the two template's var
[04:57:16] <DevAntoine> Cork is a core dev?
[05:02:49] <Mark___> hello
[05:02:59] <Mark___> does anybody have any idea how i can emulate this webpage? http://www.layoutskin.com/beginning
[05:05:16] <DevAntoine> Uhkis, Xatenev: it works with innerHTML
[05:05:23] <DevAntoine> so it seems it's a jQuery bug yeah
[05:15:38] <DevAntoine> I think my bug is cause by this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L441
[05:15:58] <Xatenev> DevAntoine: why?
[05:16:05] <DevAntoine> considering the html to append is referenced by the element which will be empty
[05:16:42] <DevAntoine> at first it empty the script, then try to set the new value, but the value is an object, which is passed by reference because it's javasqcript
[05:17:02] <Xatenev> Aah
[05:17:02] <DevAntoine> so jQuery is trying to append an object which is already empty
[05:17:02] <Xatenev> I get that
[05:17:15] <DevAntoine> but I don't understand why it's working in Chrome
[05:17:23] <Xatenev> Probably chrome does some tricks
[05:17:25] <Xatenev> in the background
[05:17:28] <Xatenev> to get over that
[05:17:28] <Xatenev> ^^
[05:17:36] <DevAntoine> or maybe the value object is not copied by reference and I'm saying stupid shits
[05:17:43] <Xatenev> Maybe that
[05:17:47] <Xatenev> But I think its some kind of jquery bug
[05:17:52] <Xatenev> because it seems like a simple usage of .html()
[05:18:01] <Xatenev> which is just not working in one browser
[05:18:06] <Xatenev> did u try IE?
[05:18:09] <Xatenev> and safari?
[05:18:40] <Xatenev> Ill try :P
[05:19:07] <Uhkis> one of the most interesting topics i've encountered here btw :-)
[05:19:12] <Xatenev> works in IE
[05:19:31] <Xatenev> works in safari
[05:19:32] <Xatenev> just FF not
[05:25:15] <DevAntoine> hum, even if I clone the element it's still not working
[05:31:06] <DevAntoine> I can't find a workaround oO
[05:35:06] <grillous> hi all
[05:46:54] <vivek> HI to all
[05:47:56] <Xatenev> DevAntoine: Maybe firefox is just mean
[05:47:56] <Xatenev> :P
[05:49:41] <Guest96258> I have one doubt ?can any body help me...
[05:53:47] <DevAntoine> Guest96258: just ask
[05:53:57] <DevAntoine> Xatenev: the only workaround I've found is using innerHTML
[05:54:47] <Xatenev> DevAntoine: very weird
[05:54:48] <Xatenev> but interesting =D
[05:55:17] <DevAntoine> Xatenev: yeah, but it's not like if I was sooooooo late in my work ::
[05:55:18] <DevAntoine> :/
[05:56:47] <Xatenev> arf^^
[05:56:50] <Xatenev> well then just go iwth innerhtml P:

[06:33:55] <DevAntoine> omg
[06:53:23] <fabio> is there any way to access iframe content from other domain?
[07:00:20] <ash_m> can you use javascript "this" as part of a calculation in the value for .width() ?
[07:00:47] <cjohnson> this is just a variable like any other
[07:01:03] <ash_m> like $('selector').width(this - previouslyDefinedValue);
[07:01:16] <cjohnson> I don't understand what you intend for that to do
[07:01:41] <ash_m> in that case, I would be hoping that "this" would take the value of $('selector').width()
[07:01:48] <cjohnson> oh, no
[07:01:58] <cjohnson> this is dependent on the scope of the function it's running in
[07:02:04] <cjohnson> not the function you're using it for
[07:02:16] <ash_m> could I use this.width()?
[07:02:27] <cjohnson> var foo = $('selector'); foo.width(foo.width() - someValue);
[07:03:04] <ash_m> cjohnson: I see; I'll use that; but is my last question also erroneous?
[07:03:29] <cjohnson> again, this is dependent on the scope of the function it's running in
[07:03:47] <cjohnson> foo(this) doesn't change the scope of this
[07:04:47] <ash_m> cjohnson: I'm not following... what would this be the context of width() ? (it kinda messes with my brain as I have never used this like that before)
[07:05:15] <cjohnson> it depends on the function you're running it in
[07:05:22] <cjohnson> it's irrelevant to .width()
[07:05:24] <cjohnson> ash_m: http://jsfiddle.net/qjfo2Lcq/
[07:06:04] <reynierpm1> hi there I am running a issue on this code http://jsbin.com/juhexowaxo/1/edit?js,output and I can not find where it is, maybe I am mistaken but in the code at // Tab4 should not html var gets empty?
[07:06:15] <ash_m> like, I'm pretty sure that $('.foo').each(function(){ this.width(); }); would refer to each object returned by each... right?
[07:07:07] <reynierpm1> nevermind I was logging the var before clear it on the if
[07:07:11] <cjohnson> ash_m: yes, .each creates a new scope
[07:07:13] <BillCriswell> ash_m: You'd prbably ant $(this).width()
[07:07:13] <cjohnson> much like .on
[07:07:25] <cjohnson> ash_m: the scope is created with function() {}, not with .each()
[07:07:43] <ash_m> cjohnson: I see, that does help me understand quite a bit
[07:07:50] <ash_m> BillCriswell: I was about to ask about that
[07:08:07] <ash_m> BillCriswell: can you use the javascript keyword "this" as opposed to $(this) ?
[07:08:27] <ash_m> cjohnson: thanks a ton, btw :)
[07:08:51] <BillCriswell> ash_m: this is the element, $(this) is the jQuery wrapped version of the element. So it wouldn't have width() since that's a jQuery method.
[07:08:54] <cjohnson> ash_m: $(this) is just wrapping jquery around whatever "this" is
[07:09:09] <cjohnson> so if "this" refers to an element (as it does in .each), you can wrap that element as such $(this)
[07:09:27] <cjohnson> you could do it with any other node. var foo = document.getElementById('foo'); var $foo = $(foo); $foo.width();
[07:09:46] <ash_m> cjohnson: BillCriswell I see, that all makes sense
[07:09:54] <ash_m> cjohnson: BillCriswell thanks a lot :)
[07:10:00] <cjohnson> no prob
[07:10:30] <ash_m> cjohnson: I often get confused as to how these things execute... I have read up on bubbling, closures and self-executing functions several times, but I still have trouble with it
[07:11:37] <cjohnson> this article helped me ash_m http://perfectionkills.com/know-thy-reference
[07:11:48] <cjohnson> it explains "this"
[07:12:13] <piratepete> anyone know of an example progress bar that is indeterminate and uses an Ajax call to periodically move the bar?
[07:13:10] <snover> it wouldn’t be indeterminate if it moves…
[07:13:24] <ash_m> cjohnson: thanks again; it's depressing to think I keep reading over this stuff and it doesn't stick; scary kinda
[07:13:54] <BillCriswell> ash_m: It takes me like 2-3 reads of anything before I even remotely understand usually.
[07:13:55] <cjohnson> it takes time and practice ash_m, don't beat yourself up
[07:15:08] <piratepete> snover: so let’s change it to determinate, does anyone know of a public example that’s clean and concise?
[07:15:20] <BillCriswell> The only way you'll really get it in my option is to actually use it.
[07:15:42] <BillCriswell> opinion*
[07:16:28] <ash_m> the other depressing thing is that I'll read something; understand it, bookmark it, and then by the time I need to reread it again; I can never find it... like... maybe I've changed computers, or it's lost among browser accounts or something... it's really quite infuriating >.<
[07:16:40] <ash_m> I'll try to be persistant BillCriswell :)
[07:16:43] <ash_m> thanks

[07:19:11] <coachz> hi gents.  Is it possible to add a line break to a tooltip?  I'm not having any luck with:  $("#windowStatus").attr('title', 'test&#13;more test');
[07:19:19] <coachz> i also tried 10 and \n
[07:20:32] <snover> piratepete: http://jsfiddle.net/dwg9heg1/1/
[07:20:42] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:20:52] <cjohnson> works fine arnoud: http://jsfiddle.net/191vp7dn/
[07:21:16] <cjohnson> coachz: use double quotes when you use \n
[07:21:39] <coachz> that worked !
[07:21:43] <coachz> what's the difference ?
[07:22:09] <cjohnson> I think that's about the only difference I can think of -- double quotes let you escape newlines
[07:22:17] <coachz> thanks very much cjohnson !!
[07:22:23] <coachz> ahh
[07:22:27] <cjohnson> In PHP double quotes also let you interpolate variables but since JS doesn't allow that I don't really know why tbh
[07:22:31] <coachz> single are literal ?
[07:22:36] <cjohnson> $foo = "my $variable here";
[07:22:41] <cjohnson> yes literal that's the right term
[07:22:47] <coachz> i'm too old for this ! :-)
[07:22:50] <cjohnson> hehe
[07:23:17] <coachz> jQuery rocks !!
[07:23:41] <shoky> hm? js has no difference between ' and "
[07:23:52] <coachz> shoky: in jquery it does
[07:23:57] <shoky> .attr('title', 'test\nbla')  works fine for me
[07:24:04] <shoky> coachz: no it doesn't
[07:24:11] <coachz> hmm it does ?
[07:24:42] <piratepete> snover: thanks! that’s perfect. I wanted to see the code mechanics :-)
[07:24:50] <cjohnson> hrm, so it seems shoky
[07:24:53] <cjohnson> odd
[07:25:01] <cjohnson> I seem to remember it mattering
[07:25:09] <coachz> you are right
[07:25:10] <cjohnson> maybe some version of IE doing weird things?
[07:25:15] <coachz> i think my grunt wasn't updating my js
[07:25:18] <cjohnson> heh
[07:25:45] <reynierpm1> hi, why, in this code http://jsbin.com/juhexowaxo/1/edit?js,output rows are repeated twice? should not render one row per iteration based on json?
[07:25:47] <coachz> just chrome here
[07:25:52] <coachz> cool thanks so much
[07:27:24] <cjohnson> scope reynierpm1
[07:27:44] <arnoud> cjohnson tnx for your js fiddle I was just my firebug console not showing up the </svg>.
[07:27:52] <cjohnson> your html variable isn't restricted to the inner function so it's shared
[07:27:54] <reynierpm1> cjohnson what you mean with scope?
[07:28:32] <cjohnson> you should almost always define variables using var reynierpm1
[07:28:44] <reynierpm1> cjohnson I changed to var and the same issue still
[07:28:46] <reynierpm1> take a look
[07:28:53] <cjohnson> right, it's still being defined *outside* the inner function
[07:28:57] <cjohnson> and you're calling += on it
[07:28:59] <Omar-> reynierpm1 put $(html).appendTo("#codigoArancelarioBody"); outside the loop
[07:29:32] <reynierpm1> Omar that is the issue it works now
[07:29:35] <lilsammy> If I have a click event on "some-class" then in that event it removed that class and adds "some-other-class" how to I make the original event not apply to that element anymore
[07:29:35] <reynierpm1> thanks
[07:29:55] <cjohnson> lilsammy: you could check the existence of the class in the event handler
[07:30:03] <cjohnson> you could alternatively use .off to remove event handlers
[07:30:16] <lilsammy> I am an idiot for not thinking of that. also though.
[07:30:16] <cjohnson> but if you plan on adding the event handler back at some other point, the if check is the better solution
[07:30:36] <lilsammy> The other class I add should make it use another click event but it doesn't is there a way to make it recheck classes?
[07:30:56] <cjohnson> it sounds like you want to toggle between two click event behaviors?
[07:31:25] <cjohnson> just put them both in one click event and use an if check to run one or the other. You can move the code bodies into 2 separate functions if you want and just call those functions based on the if check
[07:31:53] <cjohnson> binding/unbinding event listeners again and again can get messy
[07:34:13] <cjohnson> lilsammy: http://jsfiddle.net/rdfdkf0f/
[07:35:18] <ash_m> does it seem really super weird to wrap a whole search result containing an image and description in an anchor? http://jsfiddle.net/93a0td9z/1/
[07:36:08] <cjohnson> no, depending on what all you're putting in there. it might cause some side-effects if you use it to wrap large chunks of code
[07:36:17] <cjohnson> but using an <a> tag like a div isn't crazy
[07:36:47] <ash_m> cjohnson: do you think it's bazaar in the scenario for my fiddle?
[07:37:03] <cjohnson> hard to say
[07:37:17] <ash_m> cjohnson: well, that's good enough for me then :P
[07:37:19] <cjohnson> you could always try and if it doesn't work out how you like, replace <a> for <div> and use onclick
[07:37:46] <ash_m> oh crud... I just realized resizing the window breaks the flow
[07:38:07] <ash_m> should I use something other than document.ready() to remedy this?
[07:38:19] <DevAntoine> hi cjohnson
[07:38:24] <DevAntoine> what do you think of this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1956
[07:38:36] <DevAntoine> if Cork could read it too it would be nice
[07:38:36] <ash_m> ^^ lazy, I know its $('document').ready(...)
[07:39:02] <DevAntoine> ash_m: (function() {}())
[07:39:07] <DevAntoine> at the end of the file obv
[07:39:26] <cjohnson> I think he answered your question DevAntoine
[07:39:55] <ash_m> o.@
[07:40:10] <cjohnson> ash_m: ideally use CSS based on viewport size to reflow things
[07:40:15] <cjohnson> you can use media queries for drastic reflowing
[07:40:17] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: yeah but I disagree. Basicaly he's saying we cannot read the content of a script tag, but it's working. What is not is the fact that I can't re set its content
[07:40:32] <DevAntoine> and, it's working anywhere except under Firefox
[07:40:43] <DevAntoine> and all the template engine use a script tag to store the templates
[07:41:03] <DevAntoine> ash_m: ??
[07:41:31] <ash_m> cjohnson: this is almost more effort than I wanted to put forth; but it beats making a million divs... like this: http://jsfiddle.net/KzVbX/63/
[07:42:11] <ash_m> DevAntoine: hmm?
[07:43:14] <lilsammy> sorry was on phone looking now thanks
[07:43:28] <lilsammy> ahhhh
[07:43:36] <cjohnson> seems to work ok here DevAntoine http://jsfiddle.net/0qLkxvt7/
[07:43:38] <cjohnson> am I missing something
[07:43:45] <cjohnson> tested in fx and chrome
[07:43:50] <lilsammy> yeah see what you mean cjohnson I should of thought of that I have used that in the past with slide downs etc
[07:43:57] <lilsammy> Thanks a million!
[07:44:03] <ash_m> cjohnson: I don't know that I can accomplish a fix using css viewports for my fiddle
[07:44:04] <cjohnson> no prob
[07:45:12] <Uhkis> DevAntoine: commented with extra info (on github)
[07:46:16] <cjohnson> you could try using .innerHTML directly, that might differ
[07:46:23] <cjohnson> but again, seems to work fine in my fiddle
[07:46:48] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: oO
[07:46:53] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: have you seen my fiddle?
[07:47:10] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: that's what I did, used innerHTML
[07:47:19] <jiffe> is there a way to use jplot so that if the plot refreshes at intervals and the page isn't the focused tab, when I refocus the tab it doesn't freeze for minutes before displaying?
[07:47:33] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: you used .html()
[07:47:42] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: have you seen *my* fiddle?
[07:48:57] <Uhkis> how on earth does that work but not DevAntoine's version
[07:49:37] <cjohnson> I'm magic
[07:50:01] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: you mean the fiddle where you use .html() too? ;) http://jsfiddle.net/0qLkxvt7/
[07:51:05] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/0qLkxvt7/1/
[07:51:16] <Uhkis> maybe there's something wrong with your html DevAntoine
[07:52:47] <cjohnson> DevAntoine: yes.
[07:52:49] <cjohnson> that's the one
[07:52:51] <cjohnson> the one where it works
[07:52:54] <Uhkis> cjohnson: explain that ^
[07:53:15] <cjohnson> it could have something to do with my += converting it to a string. maybe it's something funky before that step
[07:53:35] <Uhkis> cjohnson: pasting that html from the broken fiddle also broke your working fiddle
[07:54:00] <Uhkis> cjohnson: http://jsfiddle.net/0qLkxvt7/1/ in case you missed the link
[07:54:49] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/0qLkxvt7/2/
[07:54:56] <cjohnson> innerHTML makes it work
[07:54:58] * cjohnson shrugs
[07:55:23] <Uhkis> we established that, yes
[07:55:28] <Uhkis> but why doesn't .html()
[07:55:43] <Uhkis> wouldn't you call that a bug?
[07:55:45] <cjohnson> we hadn't established that yet imo
[07:55:54] <cjohnson> maybe. hard to say what the logic is with <script> tags
[07:56:01] <cjohnson> may just be a misfeature
[07:56:31] <Uhkis> that first innerHTML was hours ago btw
[07:56:43] <cjohnson> I just created it
[07:57:12] <Uhkis> yeah, but the point where DevAntoine first made it work
[07:57:32] <cjohnson> Ok.
[07:57:41] <Uhkis> ~3h ago :-)
[07:57:45] <cjohnson> Ok.
[07:58:26] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: [16:47] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: that's what I did, used innerHTML
[07:58:48] <DevAntoine> [14:05] <DevAntoine> Uhkis, Xatenev: it works with innerHTML
[07:59:04] <cjohnson> the only fiddles I've seen from you used .html()
[07:59:10] <cjohnson> in here, on the github issue
[07:59:18] <cjohnson> I was pointing out that they are different
[07:59:21] <cjohnson> if you found a solution, great
[07:59:24] <cjohnson> if you think it's a bug, submit a report
[08:01:21] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: that's why I've created an issue on github
[08:01:35] <DevAntoine> and in this issue I'm saying I've found a workaround with innerHTML, that's all
[08:02:12] <cjohnson> k
[08:02:56] <Uhkis> i still don't get why cjohnson's fiddle worked, but after pasting DevAntoine's html, it broke
[08:03:35] <DevAntoine> maybe something related to {{ }}
[08:03:40] <Uhkis> could there be nbps's in there? (utf8 character)
[08:03:41] <DevAntoine> but mustache is using this too oO
[08:04:42] <cjohnson> check out their source and see how they're getting it
[08:05:06] <cjohnson> well wait, .innerHTML worked every time
[08:05:13] <cjohnson> so that's why, mustache doesn't use jquery
[08:05:30] <cjohnson> jquery's .html() method must do more than just return this.innerHTML;
[08:07:16] <pacmanfan> is it necessary to use children to navigate the DOM hierarchy?
[08:07:33] <cjohnson> pacmanfan: need more details about your question
[08:08:18] <pacmanfan> i.e.  $("table").children("tr").children("td")
[08:08:39] <pacmanfan> or can do do $("table").("tr").("td")   instead?
[08:08:45] <cjohnson> $('table tr td')
[08:08:46] <pacmanfan> *can i do
[08:08:46] <cjohnson> or
[08:08:53] <cjohnson> $('table').find('td')
[08:09:12] <cjohnson> depends on your code
[08:09:38] <cjohnson> the tr bit is unnecessary
[08:09:50] <pacmanfan> expanding on your first example, how about $('table#main tr td.heading') ??
[08:10:01] <cjohnson> tr is unnecessary but yep that's fine
[08:10:16] <pacmanfan> so i can skip elements in the DOM tree when selecting? cool
[08:10:27] <cjohnson> yep, you already are (the tbody)
[08:14:27] <cjohnson> they generally work like CSS selectors pacmanfan. if you don't want to skip elements, use > :  $('div > p > b') as opposed to $('div p b') or simply $('div b')
[08:15:48] <pacmanfan> hmm, i can't think of a use case where i specifically wouldn't want to skip elements
[08:17:19] <cjohnson> nested structures is a common one
[08:17:37] <cjohnson> but generally yeah if I want to select only specific b tags, I would generally give them classes
[08:18:33] <cjohnson> pacmanfan: if you have <ul id="top"> <li>foo <ul> <li>foo.a</li> <li>foo.b</li> </ul> </li> <li>bar <ul> ...
[08:18:46] <cjohnson> you might want to do $('#top > li') to only access the top-level li tags
[08:19:35] <Mamun> hi
[08:20:40] <pacmanfan> oh sure, that makes sense
[08:21:44] <pacmanfan> thanks for the explanation :)
[08:22:18] <cjohnson> no prob
[08:24:56] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: yeah, the related code is here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L441
[08:25:00] <DevAntoine> cjohnson: it's cause by the empty
[08:25:30] <DevAntoine> and considering the value is an object, and in js object are passed by reference, and this object is the same object which is empty just before getting set, that might be that
[08:25:47] <DevAntoine> but still weird, cause clone don't fix the issue, and it's still only happening with firefox
[08:25:48] <Uhkis> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L22 this might have something to do with it also
[08:27:00] <cjohnson> yeah might be: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L211
[08:33:45] <pacmanfan> how can i check the status of radio buttons?
[08:34:32] <pacmanfan> i have a group of radio buttons, i need to know if the user selected one or not
[08:34:35] <fabio> how do i test if an element exists on iframe?
[08:36:21] <BillCriswell> fabio: On the same domain?
[08:36:40] <cjohnson> nope. already answered in ##javascript
[08:36:42] <cjohnson> damn cross posting :P
[08:37:04] <fabio> cjohnson, cross domain hehehe
[08:37:04] <fabio> xD
[08:37:07] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[08:37:13] <pacmanfan> i think i found my answer
[08:37:36] <fabio> BillCriswell, need to be any way
[08:37:52] <fabio> *have some dark way at least xD
[08:38:08] <BillCriswell> You'd need a proxy, or control over the other domain
[08:38:42] <fabio> BillCriswell, well the facebook doesnt give me the controll :D
[08:39:13] <cjohnson> a proxy prob won't help either given how crazy the architecture of a FB page is
[08:39:18] <cjohnson> pacmanfan: http://jsfiddle.net/98q7wgon/ is how I'd do it
[08:39:35] <BillCriswell> fabio: You want the login screen or something?
[08:39:44] <pacmanfan> oh, hey, better than how i was trying to do it
[08:39:45] <pacmanfan> :D
[08:39:56] <pacmanfan> and better than yesterday's attempt without jquery
[08:40:00] <fabio> BillCriswell, i want to know if the user has already liked my facebook page
[08:40:13] <fabio> without have the user_likes permission on app
[08:40:42] <BillCriswell> fabio: You'd not going to be able to get access to that type of information without going through their API.
[08:41:19] <fabio> BillCriswell, my bets are on the button that facebook renders on page. if the page was liked, its on diferent colour
[08:41:52] <fabio> BillCriswell, the thing is the facebook renders it with an iframe
[08:42:09] <cjohnson> I almost guarantee that even if you do find a hacky work around, facebook will be fixing it shortly. And that's a big if
[08:42:25] <cjohnson> they very much want you to use their API
[08:43:08] <fabio> cjohnson, my crasy idea is take a screenshot of a rendered page and then analyze the colours on the image
[08:43:22] <fabio> if the colour match the css color of the buttton
[08:43:24] <fabio> voala :D
[08:43:53] <fabio> ive found a script that does the screenshoot of the page, the thing is DOESNT SHOW IFRAMES!!!!
[08:43:59] <fabio> F****
[08:44:00] <fabio> xD
[08:44:04] <cjohnson> no shit. it's a security concern
[08:44:26] <fabio> its just a simple image :D
[08:44:38] <cjohnson> it's a security concern.
[08:54:08] <mikunos> hi guys I need to get the geolocalisation by the geoPosition object and I have already done it! but there is a problem the first time. I need to refresh the page to get the result of the position query. This is my code: http://snipet.co.uk/18
[08:54:57] <robertmaxrees> i think you want if(geoPosition.init){
[08:55:02] <robertmaxrees> and then call the init in the if statement.
[09:10:31] <cannap>  var currentSection = $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent(); is there a way to make something like parent({depth: 5}); or something
[09:10:33] <cannap> this looks so ugly
[09:11:13] <cannap> or other function to call the div direct?
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[09:11:39] <robertmaxrees> and select on a class.
[09:11:43] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/a6s2yb78/4/ robertmaxrees
[09:12:10] <robertmaxrees> mikunos wat
[09:12:17] <mikunos> I need to execute the getEvents() only after the end of the request of the postPosition
[09:12:25] <robertmaxrees> there's an "external resources" section for libraries btw
[09:12:33] <robertmaxrees> and what does this have to do with my suggestion?
[09:12:42] <Nialcen> Hello all
[09:13:01] <mikunos> robertmaxrees I have tested the external resource and I have not find the way to attach the script
[09:13:06] <Nialcen> I got a conception problem, as I want two jQuery UI Slider to work together, is someone alredy do something like  that, in order to drive me a bit ?
[09:13:14] <cannap> thx robertmaxrees
[09:13:15] <mikunos> btw your suggestion is not good in my case
[09:13:27] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[09:13:43] <mikunos> I need to execute the getEvents() only at the end of the postPosition() method
[09:13:54] <robertmaxrees> then put it in the success callback of the ajax call.
[09:14:25] <mikunos> exactly but how?
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees> see where you have that function() {} in the $.post() for postPosition?
[09:15:02] <robertmaxrees> drop the callback there
[09:15:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a6s2yb78/5/
[09:15:22] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[09:16:36] <mikunos> have I to delete the old getEvents() call, right?
[09:17:30] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:17:34] <mikunos> ok thanks
[09:17:48] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing if(geoPosition.init()) btw?
[09:17:53] <robertmaxrees> is that to test for existence?
[09:19:32] <mikunos> yes robertmaxrees
[09:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to do that.
[09:20:16] <mikunos> ????
[09:20:20] <robertmaxrees> you want to do if (geoPosition && geoPosition.init()) {}
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> * (geoPosition && geoPosition.init) {}
[09:20:36] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll throw an error is browsers that don't support it.
[09:20:48] <mikunos> oh ok
[09:20:50] <mikunos> thank
[09:20:52] <mikunos> you
[09:36:06] <dandaman> hey so i have an element and I want to get an element within that element
[09:36:15] <dandaman> so like $(this).$('#myID')
[09:36:21] <dandaman> how can i do this?
[09:36:43] <dandaman> I can't go like $(this + '#myID') can i?
[09:36:45] <BillCriswell> dandaman: .find()
[09:36:54] <BillCriswell> $(this).find('.some-other-jawn')
[09:36:56] <dandaman> BillCriswell: i thought find only works for tags
[09:37:06] <BillCriswell> dandaman: Nope.
[09:37:15] <dandaman> cool, thanks
[09:37:21] <BillCriswell> If you're looking for an id you should just do $('#myID') though
[09:37:23] <dandaman> should be trying stuff before asking :\
[09:37:26] <BillCriswell> Since there should be only one.
[09:37:45] <dandaman> BillCriswell: I'm doing it by name, i just forgot the syntax for getting by name
[09:37:55] <BillCriswell> dandaman: Ah ok just making sure.
[09:39:07] <dandaman> score, it worked, thanks dude
[09:39:32] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell - the chillingest dude in #jquery
[09:40:01] <BillCriswell> I was told I was the "definition" of laid back by a coworker yesterday.
[09:41:01] <Uhkis> i vote Velveeta to be the chillingest dude here
[09:41:13] * Velveeta chillaxes in the co'na.
[09:41:19] <Uhkis> see?! :D
[09:41:31] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee is pretty chill too
[09:41:47] <robertmaxrees> got some chillbro swaggins up in here.
[09:41:49] <BillCriswell> As is decx.
[09:41:56] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[09:42:03] <robertmaxrees> and shoky
[09:42:16] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:42:27] <Uhkis> we have a lot chill (and skilled) people in here
[09:42:35] <BillCriswell> My vote actually goes to shoky.
[09:42:36] <NoiseEee> i am chill because i'm trying to decide if i spend $219 on a full ice rink kit with brackets etc or $50 on a bag that you fill up with water :|
[09:42:47] <NoiseEee> sorry thats 'chilly'
[09:42:55] <NoiseEee> chilly winter thoughts
[09:42:59] <robertmaxrees> that's a chilling revelation.
[09:43:05] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Never even know there were ice rink kits.
[09:43:15] <Uhkis> NoiseEee: full kit of course
[09:43:22] <NoiseEee> look at this awesomeness http://www.rinkmaster.com/
[09:43:25] <Uhkis> (depending on what that means)
[09:43:34] <decx> plussed without writing, neat
[09:43:38] <NoiseEee> yeah Uhkis im leaning toward that, better in warm spells and re-usable
[09:43:38] <BillCriswell> I think I want some business cards that say DHTML Master
[09:44:00] <robertmaxrees> yusss
[09:44:18] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Nice. Seems a lot easier than I imagined.
[09:44:50] <Uhkis> i was thinking of something entirely different :D
[09:45:19] <NoiseEee> my wife might shoot me if i spend $219 on  skating rink though
[09:45:31] <NoiseEee> but i think by the 2nd week of being able to skate when the kids go to bed she'd be happy
[09:45:47] <Uhkis> $219 on hockey is on the low price range
[09:46:36] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I imagine the difficult part would be finding ground flat enough?
[09:46:42] <Velveeta> you could always spend even more than that on an occulus rift and some software to just make her *think* she's able to skate when the kids go to bed
[09:47:23] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: water gets pretty flat even if the surface isn't ;)
[09:47:51] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I was talking about an incline or a decline to keep the water in the area.
[09:48:34] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: well that thing looks like at least 10cm tall
[09:48:47] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I guess it wouldhave to be a pretty serious incline.
[09:48:56] <BillCriswell> I knew the top of it would be flat :-p
[09:50:09] <Uhkis> also, it kinda has to be high enough not to break the ice while skating on it
[09:54:40] <BillCriswell> It's a pretty cool idea.
[09:54:45] <BillCriswell> If I had a back yard I'd do it.
[09:56:01] <Uhkis> would be cool, too bad winters in finland aren't winters anymore
[09:56:36] <Uhkis> also missing that backyard
[09:57:02] <robertmaxrees> backyards are the worst.
[09:57:06] <robertmaxrees> you can have mine.
[09:58:59] <Uhkis> tired of mowing the lawn? :D
[09:59:06] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: So I own land in california now?
[09:59:12] <BillCriswell> Didn't some gold thing happen there.
[09:59:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, near my town.
[09:59:27] <robertmaxrees> well, near-ish.
[09:59:36] <BillCriswell> So I probably have gold in my back yard.
[09:59:39] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis i actually like mowing my lawn, it's everything else i hate.
[09:59:46] <BillCriswell> Can you dig it up and get me the monies.
[10:00:05] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: like?
[10:00:20] <robertmaxrees> the drought followed by the rain killed my lawns.
[10:00:25] <robertmaxrees> so now I have massive mud pits.
[10:00:36] <Uhkis> oh
[10:00:39] <BillCriswell> Yuck.
[10:00:44] <robertmaxrees> and my wife gets ideas about things she wants that require a ton of work.
[10:00:45] <robertmaxrees> D:
[10:01:15] <Uhkis> "DIY!"
[10:01:17] <robertmaxrees> oh and my neighbors all have big trees that they never get trimmed on my side of the fences so I get all their leaves.
[10:01:42] <robertmaxrees> and branches and stuff.  1st world problems.
[10:17:20] <NoiseEee> haha Velveeta
[10:17:31] <Scriptonaut> do events not bubble by default?
[10:17:43] <Velveeta> depends on the event
[10:17:46] <Scriptonaut> I have a click even for a div
[10:17:53] <Scriptonaut> and I also have a click event for document
[10:17:58] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut they DO bubble by default.
[10:17:59] <Velveeta> that one should bubble by default
[10:18:03] <Scriptonaut> but when I click on the div the document one isn't being bubbled
[10:18:11] <robertmaxrees> *the event isn't bubbling.
[10:18:11] <Scriptonaut> isn't being fired*
[10:18:21] <Scriptonaut> ya
[10:18:22] <robertmaxrees> and that means something is stopping propagation along the way
[10:19:32] <Scriptonaut> fhttps://gist.github.com/robins35/91504571b8ea502be99f
[10:19:54] <Scriptonaut> line 44 is where the document (it's changed to window in this case) event is defined
[10:20:06] <robertmaxrees> *event handler.
[10:20:07] <Scriptonaut> and line 17 is where the div's click event is defined
[10:20:14] <Scriptonaut> yes handler
[10:20:36] <robertmaxrees> and the dropdown init would need to happen before the event is emitted.
[10:21:03] <Scriptonaut> ya, dropdown is called on pageload
[10:21:08] <Scriptonaut> initDropDown()
[10:21:48] <robertmaxrees> theoretically it should work, but there's a lot implied here i can't see.
[10:21:57] <Scriptonaut> ah, dang
[10:22:05] <Scriptonaut> it's a rails project so there could very well be some other stuff
[10:22:10] <Scriptonaut> thanks for the help
[10:22:12] <robertmaxrees> rails is irrelevant ;)
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> it's only whatever is in the client side.
[10:22:39] <Scriptonaut> ya, but rails often times will bundle some JS or something in there without you knowing
[10:22:47] <Scriptonaut> like some gem might have some JS library it loads for you
[10:22:51] <robertmaxrees> the "asset pipeline"
[10:22:56] <Scriptonaut> yep
[10:23:43] <Scriptonaut> hey, is there a way to fire/trigger an event?
[10:24:05] <robertmaxrees> .trigger()
[10:24:07] <Scriptonaut> I could explicitly trigger the document.click event inside the div click event
[10:24:12] <Scriptonaut> htanks
[10:24:15] <robertmaxrees> but don't do that.
[10:24:18] <NoiseEee> in general its better to call the event handler thats assigned to the event, Scriptonaut
[10:24:24] <robertmaxrees> just call the handler directly.
[10:24:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:24:27] <Scriptonaut> oh
[10:24:33] <Scriptonaut> ok so I need to name the function then right
[10:24:37] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:24:47] <robertmaxrees> don't proxy through the DOM like that if you can avoid it
[10:25:02] <Scriptonaut> ah, I didn't know that was bad practice, but it makes sense why it is
[10:26:23] <robertmaxrees> decouple your markup from your logic.
[10:55:29] <paulvd> hello, is there any way to check if an element is "partly" visible in the viewport ?
[10:55:49] <robertmaxrees> you can check to see if the top is in the viewport, but not the bottom.
[10:59:00] <BillCriswell> paulvd: I think I have code that does this.
[11:00:46] <paulvd> BillCriswell: and what is that?
[11:00:49] <BillCriswell> https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/540523374917984256 holy shit, did this exactly a year ago.
[11:00:49] <b-ot> BillCriswell: @brad_frost: After a week or two of using Inbox, I went back to using Gmail on both desktop and mobile. I found the interface really distracting.
[11:00:54] <BillCriswell> opps, wrong link.
[11:00:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/avaTAzUb/6/edit?html,css,js,output
[11:01:43] <BillCriswell> paulvd: You would calculate the offset top and the height of the element comparsed to the scroll top basically.
[11:01:58] <paulvd> hm
[11:02:09] <BillCriswell> compared*
[11:02:16] <BillCriswell> comparsed does sound like a real word.
[11:02:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like some crazy mathematics term.
[11:02:50] <BillCriswell> Which means I definitely couldn't have invented it.
[11:03:06] <BillCriswell> That's so weird ago. A year ago today I did that code.
[11:04:34] <BillCriswell> That's so weird though*
[11:09:04] <MikeD_> should I create/append options inside a loop, or reduce an array to a giant string and construct  the entire option list of a select in on operation?
[11:09:59] <duch_kazatel> build a fragment and append all at once.
[11:22:21] <abailarri> I know that my question is not ljquery strictly, but, what ways I have to create a webapp for have videochat rooms?
[11:22:36] <cjohnson> which part are you unsure about abailarri?
[11:22:45] <cjohnson> also try ##javascript and ##web
[11:29:09] <Taplar> anyone else getting a connection refused when trying to access code.jquery.com (ex. http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js) ?
[11:34:11] <cjohnson> works fine here
[11:34:17] <cjohnson> prob your network
[11:36:01] <Taplar> fun... ty
[11:37:20] <Slim> Hi guys! I'm having a weird issue... I'm adding an html element via jquery but it doesn't show up unless i make a change to it in chrome's element editor
[11:38:01] <Slim> when I go into the element viewer in chrome and "Edit as HTML" on the element that's not showing up, I can make a change and it shows up right then
[11:38:17] <Slim> Has anyone run into this bug before?
[11:40:29] <NoiseEee> you'd have to reproduce it on jsfiddle or something Slim, but no.
[11:40:42] <NoiseEee> is it just not styled correctly?
[12:04:18] <Misbehavist> :>
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee!
[13:55:59] <Misbehavist> gaize
[13:56:08] <Misbehavist> i gota take puss
[13:56:10] <Misbehavist> piss
[13:56:16] <Misbehavist> sory lel
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:57:19] <cjohnson> well be sure to read the docs Misbehavist
[13:58:12] <wazyl> having one hell of a time, trying to figure out why my $_POST content turns up blank via my ajax call.
[13:59:00] <cjohnson> use network tab and check what you're sending
[13:59:12] <cjohnson> paste your code if there's nothing obvious in the network tab
[14:03:20] <wazyl> http://pastebin.com/hi7CXEs2
[14:04:10] <wazyl> url is pretty much: print_r($_POST) to begin, with no further echo/print statements contained within.
[14:05:01] <cjohnson> how did your network tab? it listed the post variables?
[14:05:09] <cjohnson> network tab look*
[14:07:00] <cjohnson> wazyl: ^
[14:07:30] <wazyl> it did. via the only POST 200 OK -> Source
[14:07:30] <wazyl> login=asd&password=fdg
[14:07:54] <cjohnson> well don't just look for "any post". look for the one you're making here
[14:08:20] <cjohnson> hint: it's not a post
[14:10:49] <shoky> wazyl: data should probably be an object, not an array.  but you can just do  data = current.serializeArray();
[14:11:28] <shoky> or even data = current.serialize()
[14:11:38] <wazyl> I did try the ladder.
[14:12:00] <shoky> oh you said the params are being sent in the request?
[14:13:34] <wazyl> i did not.  but now that you mention it, i guess, i'm basically reworking the request aren't I.  I'm pulling the data from the form of sending via data; I suppose if that's the case, there really isn't anything in _POST ?
[14:13:53] <wazyl> hmm, I better, hold off on digging deeper with that thought train .
[14:14:50] <wazyl> new to this, so, I'm really talking about things I don't know quite well. anyways, I'll keep looking with firebug there.
[14:14:50] <shoky> if the form's action is post, and it has some inputs with names, that should work ok, if data is an object instead of an array, or you use serialize/serializeArray
[14:16:43] <shoky> er i mean the form's method, not action
[14:18:15] <wazyl> ok, well apparently, I'm full of shit.   I had originally tried data = $('form.ajax').serialize(); .
[14:20:31] <shoky> that could work, in some cases ;p
[14:26:24] <wazyl> shoky, is specifying dataType a must ?
[14:27:00] <wazyl> it seems, my return false is no longer triggered with those changes, though the url is printing a populated $_POST array now.
[14:27:13] <shoky> wazyl: no, that only tells jquery how to treat the response from the server
[14:28:07] <shoky> donno about your return false, but the proper way to prevent a form submit is...   .on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... })
[14:28:16] <shoky> return false should work too though
[14:34:03] <wazyl> alright, saw a TypeError fly past my console before it redirected to the php page.
[14:34:38] <shoky> you can have your console not clear automatically
[14:39:13] <Seedmanc> Suppose I have a set of elements of class A, each of them, in its turn has an element of same class somewhere deeper in the hierarchy. How do I write a selector that would only return me the list of upper elements of that class without the inner matches?
[14:39:35] <wazyl> shoky, cjohnson - thanks a lot .
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Seedmanc
[14:42:22] <b-ot> Seedmanc: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:44:41] <shoky> Seedmanc: here's one way.. $('.a').filter(function() { return !$(this).parents().is('.a') })
[14:47:15] <sahbeewah> alternatively: $(‘.a’).not(‘.a .a’)
[14:48:29] <Seedmanc> sahbeewah thanks, this seems to be working
[14:51:07] <cjohnson> I think I would prob do $('.parent .child').closest('.parent') or something like that
[14:51:39] <cjohnson> assuming closest works on collections like I think it does
[14:52:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd separate out the classes personally.
[14:53:06] <cjohnson> oh didn't notice it was same class. you could do the same deal with $('.parent .parent').closest('.parent') I guess. but I'd aim for 2 classes
[14:57:29] <shoky> .closest also looks at current element
[14:58:35] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[15:16:23] <varchar> Can someone tell my why the contextmenu doesn't line to the absolute top of the cursor pointer? http://jsfiddle.net/upyqp63p/
[15:32:50] <shoky> varchar: because the <ul> has a big margin by default
[15:39:53] <varchar> yea, thanks, margin: 0 fixed it.
[16:13:29] <nateritter> how would one pass an unknown number of parameters to $.when() ?
[16:25:58] <shoky> nateritter: using .apply  e.g.  $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises).then(..)
[16:28:10] <nateritter> shoky: Ok, right. Got that working. However, trying this passes one argument at a time to somefunction, rather than all of them as an array at the same time… $.when.apply($, promises.done(somefunction.apply($, [‘d1’, ‘d2’])); ….
[16:29:25] <nateritter> shoky: Sorry, stupid question… let me start over….
[16:29:27] <shoky> nateritter: not sure what you're trying to do there... that doesn't look right
[16:30:28] <shoky> but yeah using $.when with multiple promises will pass multiple arguments to your $.when callback
[16:31:06] <shoky> you can access them as an array via 'arguments'. (it's array-like)
[16:31:19] <nateritter> I want to pass all values (let’s say retuned from multiple ajax calls) to a callback after all the promises are fulfilled.
[16:33:33] <nateritter> So, I’m using $.when.apply($, promises) just fine… but then I want to send an unknown number of values to one single function, one time, …
[16:34:15] <nateritter> Here’s another way to put it …. I want to call via ajax and put all the responses together into an object or array.
[16:34:30] <nateritter> (multiple ajax calls… unknown number of calls actually)
[16:37:10] <shoky> nateritter: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv6rvfL/
[16:38:14] <shoky> args has 2 items, one for each request. each of these items is itself an array of size 3, where in index 0 there's the response body/object
[16:39:33] <nateritter> shoky: *looking*… and thank you...
[16:45:55] <nateritter> shoky: Works like a charm! Man, I’ve been beating my head against a wall trying to understand $.when, .apply, promises and deferred… crazy. This is so much simpler than the route I was taking. Thank you!!!
[16:46:16] <shoky> ;] no probs
[18:53:04] <iLogic> hey guys, i'm using .on('click', function()) on an <a> tag and works at first, but stops working after a .load() .. anyone has any idea?
[18:55:11] <iLogic> nevermind i solved it
[18:55:32] <iLogic> target has to be outside the loaded content
[19:30:59] <smokeyd> hey all, I am looking to create a drag-and-drop form-builder for inclusing in a webapp. What I am thinking is that I provide a bunch of fields and the user can drag-and-drop them into place in the form.
[19:32:17] <smokeyd> I could build something with sortable and draggable, but I would like the user to have quite a lot of control over the placement, like place fields side by side (float-left divs percentage width), or drag fields in between other fields.
[19:32:28] <smokeyd> so it is a bit more complicated than simple draggable and sortable
[19:32:49] <smokeyd> does a libary or something already exist that does something similar?
[19:32:56] <smokeyd> it would save me a hell of a lot of time I think
[19:36:17] <Mark_2> does anybody here know how to make a layer slide from the left to right as i enter the page?
[19:36:25] <Mark_2> im not sure if it’s jquery or css3
[19:44:09] <AcidRain2012> Mark_2 u should check out animate
[19:44:38] <Mark_2> AcidRain2012 : thx
[19:44:51] <AcidRain2012> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_animation1
[19:45:00] <AcidRain2012> actually here appears to be exactlly what you are looking for
[19:51:15] <Mark_2> hmm, it sort of does, but i don;t know how to make it play by itself
[19:51:22] <Mark_2> not clicking on the button
[19:53:49] <AcidRain2012> put it in the on document load
[19:54:40] <AcidRain2012> $(document).ready(function(){ $("div").animate({left:'250px'}, 3000); });
[19:57:02] <iLogic> Mark_2: is it a plugin you're using?
[19:57:19] <Mark_2> hmm?
[19:57:59] <iLogic> you didn't make the site, you're just making this one alteration?
[19:58:50] <Mark_2> im not sure if im getting your question right
[19:59:01] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today this is my website
[19:59:08] <Mark_2> and hey AcidRain2012
[19:59:12] <Mark_2> it worked thanks.
[20:13:00] <AcidRain2012> Mark_2 np :P
[21:08:57] <sandstorm|away> guys can I ask a question
[21:16:05] <andrew9183> !ask
[21:16:05] <b-ot> andrew9183: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:18:21] <secrettriangle> Anyone good with Isotope/Masonry know how to get this to resize smoothly? http://secrettriangle.net:8080/
[21:18:38] <andrew9183> secrettriangle: your site never loads
[21:19:02] <secrettriangle> andrew9183: it's changed a lot since the last you saw it probably
[21:19:15] <andrew9183> nope it still doesnt load
[21:19:22] <secrettriangle> It's not loading?
[21:19:26] <andrew9183> nope
[21:19:33] <secrettriangle> Can you screenshot?
[21:19:53] <secrettriangle> Or be more verbose, not loading could mean 1000x things
[21:21:20] <secrettriangle> andrew9183: hmm trying it now, you might be right
[21:41:03] <secrettriangle> andrew9183: fixed it
[21:41:10] <secrettriangle> Anyone good with Isotope/Masonry know how to get this to layout correctly on page load? http://secrettriangle.net:8080/
