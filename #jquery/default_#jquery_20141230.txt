[00:26:18] <Kartagis> probably very basic, but why am I getting undefined is not a function here ---> http://jsfiddle.net/0bv4pgzf/
[00:32:43] <suspicious_ee> Kartagis: too old jQuery version?
[00:33:40] <Kartagis> suspicious_eel: 1.6.4
[00:34:30] <Kartagis> heh, it's gone now
[00:34:50] <Kartagis> I thought .on was after 1.5.something
[00:39:23] <Kartagis> also, it didn't addClass
[00:42:59] <suspicious_ee> Kartagis: that's because your selector should be $("#work")
[00:43:15] <suspicious_ee> instead of $("#id")
[00:43:22] * Kartagis headdesks
[00:43:30] <Kartagis> of course
[00:43:40] <Kartagis> oh, it's bleeding
[00:55:25] <DevAntoine> hi
[00:56:50] <DevAntoine> I've got a selector returning multiple inputs. Is there some one liner equals to this: $mySelector.each(function() { $(this).val($(this).attr('foo')) }) ?? I tried this: $basePriceInputs.val($basePriceInputs.attr('data-dpa') but it sets the same value for all my inputs
[01:55:35] <arthurvr> Hi everybody!
[01:57:14] <Katharsis> hi
[02:02:35] <Katharsis> do you have experience with salvattore.min.js ?
[02:03:21] <arthurvr> nope
[02:03:45] <arthurvr> http://salvattore.com/ ?
[02:03:58] <Katharsis> yes
[02:05:32] <joroc> anyone using hammerjs?
[02:06:21] <Katharsis> arthurvr: http://pastebin.com/yfJ2wfhn check it out
[02:06:48] <Katharsis> i do not know how to reinitialize / reload main function in this script
[02:27:13] <jmdrawne_> Is there jquery method for +/- a date drop down selection? I'm currently using .val() - '1' etc but it seems to do odd things like jump to -month
[02:31:58] <jmdrawne_> Or is there a function to take the year into account too? ie when I press + it goes to Jan 2014
[02:53:33] <Laban> I've got an issue with accessing an appended object, can someone take a glimpse for me? http://jsfiddle.net/SimFre/qtjxsx2L/5/
[03:07:33] <Katharsis> i need lazy scrolling effect for 3 photo columns like this http://www.wookmark.com/, any jQuery plugin recommendation?
[03:14:20] <Omar-> Katharsis create your own, it's cheaper http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/infinite-scrolling/
[03:14:46] <Katharsis> Omar-: i'm not frontend dev.
[03:16:09] <Omar-> Katharsis http://www.jqueryrain.com/demo/jquery-lazy-load/
[03:20:33] <jmdrawne_> jQuery('#edit-field-dates-value-1-value-month option:eq('+n+')')    <-- please can someone tell me why n has + at either side?
[03:26:21] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ n is variable
[03:26:51] <Omar-> var n = number here, e.g. var n = 1
[03:26:54] <jmdrawne_> Omar-: Would $n work too then?
[03:27:55] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ var $n is the same as var n
[03:28:03] <jmdrawne_> Omar-: Learning php + js at the same and its getting a tad confusing :oD
[03:28:31] <jmdrawne_> Omar-: So when I call it I can use $n or +n+ ?
[03:30:02] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ hmmm, I'm not a PHP expert but you could echo it
[03:30:31] <jmdrawne_> Omar-: Sorry I'm just asking about js
[03:37:26] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ if n is defined yes you can.
[03:37:51] <jmdrawne_> Omar-: So what the difference? Why do both exist?
[03:37:53] <Omar-> $('#edit-field-dates-value-1-value-month option').eq(n) or .eq($n)
[03:38:31] <Omar-> $n and n? developers usually use $ to refer to an object
[03:38:41] <jmdrawne_> What about +n+ ?
[03:38:54] <Omar-> for example var $n = "<div class="whatever">foo</div>";
[03:41:35] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ + = . in php
[03:41:45] <Omar-> php .$variable. inside a string
[03:41:48] <jmdrawne_> ah
[03:41:52] <jmdrawne_> Now that makes sense
[03:41:56] <Omar-> js + n + inside a string
[03:42:28] <Omar-> var n = 0; hello + n // result: hello0
[03:44:49] <jmdrawne_> Ace, thanks for explaining that
[03:45:23] <Omar-> you're welcome
[04:16:21] <nikio_> hey
[04:16:48] <nikio_> how can I use http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ , to write a message to the user incase the server is down?
[04:19:18] <Omar-> jmdrawne_ sorry "hello" + n or 'hello' + n
[04:19:28] <Omar-> hello is a string, strings should be quoted
[04:19:54] <Omar-> "hello" + n + "world" = hello0world
[04:20:12] <arthurvr> nikio_: You can use .fail to write a message to the user
[04:20:35] <nikio_> arthurvr, ah ok
[04:20:45] <arthurvr> I mean jqXHR.fail()
[04:21:14] <nikio_> arthurvr, h
[04:21:20] <nikio_> that seems complex
[04:21:23] <arthurvr> why,
[04:21:56] <nikio_> arthurvr,so what do i change?
[04:21:57] <nikio_> http://hastebin.com/lozuyozoqo.js
[04:22:55] <arthurvr> http://hastebin.com/efixejenad.js
[04:23:11] <arthurvr> $.post is just a shorthand for $.ajax, so it returns a jqXHR
[04:23:23] <arthurvr> which will fire .fail when the request fails
[04:24:12] <arthurvr> (btw, before asking questions, this all was just in the api docs)
[04:24:26] <Laban> Any clue as to why my ajax-in-ajax-append-thingy is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/SimFre/qtjxsx2L/5/
[04:24:44] <arthurvr> let me look
[04:25:19] <arthurvr> just to clarify, what is it expected to do?
[04:25:27] <Laban> I'm appending a <ul> to a div, and wish to keep a reference to that specific ul and pass it to a function that adds the <li>'s
[04:26:00] <CssNoob> Why doesn't this work?
[04:26:05] <CssNoob> <p onclick="$(this).hide();"> fuck you, pay me! </p>
[04:26:18] <Laban> Line 20 of the js onwards.
[04:27:38] <Omar-> Laban target returns no specfic target
[04:27:41] <Laban> CssNoob: Works here....
[04:28:11] <CssNoob> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[04:28:15] <Laban> CssNoob: http://jsfiddle.net/SimFre/s9aLxj0r/
[04:28:26] <Laban> Did you load jQuery?
[04:28:40] <Omar-> Laban fixed http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qtjxsx2L/6/
[04:29:00] <Omar-> var target = $(entry)
[04:29:58] <Omar-> Laban var target = $(".jsCommmentContainer", $(entry)); is incorrect. you are looking for jsCommmentContainer inside itself
[04:31:22] <Laban> Ah
[04:33:31] <Omar-> Laban $(".child", $(parent))
[04:33:46] <Omar-> same as  $(parent).find(".child")
[04:34:08] <Omar-> $(".jsCommmentContainer", $(entry)) .jsCommmentContainer is $(entry)
[04:39:42] <Laban> Thanks
[04:40:12] <CssNoob> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not definedindex.htm:8 onclick
[04:40:18] <CssNoob> Still not working
[04:40:34] <CssNoob> It works from fiddle
[04:41:18] <Laban> Omar-: Updated a little, to make the tag tree a litle... http://jsfiddle.net/SimFre/qtjxsx2L/7/ Shouldn't this target be correct?
[04:41:35] <Laban> CssNoob: Is jQuery properly loaded?
[04:43:02] <nikio_> arthurvr, i saw it in the docs but i didnt see an example like you just showed
[04:43:13] <CssNoob> Shit, wrong typo
[04:43:19] <arthurvr> there is an exmple in
[04:43:44] <nikio_> arthurvr, yes i saw it before, but i didnt realize that was the one i needed :s
[04:43:45] <nikio_> sorry
[04:43:49] <[Non]> have anyone tried use jquery function in angularjs controller?
[04:44:04] <nikio_> i thought it was something else for some reason
[04:44:50] <arthurvr> nikio_: okay. Np ;-)
[04:45:52] <arthurvr> [Non]: of course. what's going wrong?
[04:46:10] <arthurvr> but you must keep in mind that angular falls  back to jQlite
[04:46:20] <arthurvr> see docs on this here: https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq
[04:46:54] <arthurvr> [Non]: ^
[04:47:26] <Omar-> Laban http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qtjxsx2L/8/
[04:49:37] <Laban> Why does that work and not mine? Isn't it pointing at the same thing?
[04:49:55] <dziegler> Can i check how far a user has scolled down on an page?
[04:50:21] <Omar-> i looked for jsCommentConatiner in second ajax call
[04:51:23] <Omar-> dziegler use $("body").scrollTop()
[04:51:41] <dziegler> Omar-: thanks
[04:52:14] <Omar-> or $(window) dziegler
[04:52:18] <XtenPhi> http://jsfiddle.net/5vmr0z9d/
[04:52:28] <XtenPhi> this need two times n hover for works
[04:52:29] <XtenPhi> why?
[04:53:06] <arthurvr> XtenPhi: check the console
[04:53:15] <arthurvr> XtenPhi: the imgpath variable isn't defined
[04:53:31] <Laban> Omar-: My thinking is that I'd like to pass the container where getComments should put its content, not define it in getComments.
[04:53:52] <arthurvr> XtenPhi: also this code won't be functional in jsfiddle because they wrap everything in a function
[04:54:19] <arthurvr> XtenPhi: you'il need to make a real reduced testcase
[04:54:20] <Omar-> Laban I got you
[04:54:34] <arthurvr> XtenPhi: where the testcase itself doesn't fail
[04:55:50] <Omar-> Laban http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qtjxsx2L/9/
[04:58:09] <Laban> Thank you! Perfect! :)
[04:59:42] <jmdrawne_> Any idea why this http://pastebin.com/LYRSnv39 n = 11 not 12?!
[05:00:49] <bacobart> jmdrawne_, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getmonth.asp
[05:00:53] <bacobart> "The getMonth() method returns the month (from 0 to 11) for the specified date, according to local time."
[05:01:34] <jmdrawne_> bacobart: Ugh thanks! Thought I was loosing the plot
[05:07:33] <Omar-> Laban or http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qtjxsx2L/10/
[05:07:37] <Omar-> the same after all
[05:09:12] <Laban> Works fine in fiddle, but I just can't get it to work on my real code.
[05:10:49] <Laban> I use Mustache to build a set of tags, and I get a jQ object back from $.Mustache.render(...), which I append just fine to the page. But I can't append stuff into the now rendered mustache object.
[05:19:41] <rodrigo23> anyone know of a good jquery slide tutorial
[05:19:49] <rodrigo23> slideshow*
[05:22:26] <XtenPhi> someone know why tooltipster plugin doesn't take the last record of the tables?
[05:22:57] <XtenPhi> The table info I'm working with jtable jquery
[05:30:27] <tirengarfio> I have modified the width of an image using css. Now I want to get the height of the modified image, how can I do that?
[05:32:08] <blackkbot> you didn't change the image height you just scaled it
[05:36:17] <blackkbot> but if its the this object you would do $(this)[0].getBoundingClientRect().width and that should give you the width
[06:17:44] <Paradisee> is possible to send json data when the mouse release the slider and changing the values above ? http://jqueryui.com/slider/#slider-vertical
[06:18:07] <Paradisee> i tried to put range instead of slide, but with range the value changes only when the mouse is released
[06:20:35] <arthurvr> yes, it has a change event
[06:20:37] <arthurvr> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[06:21:02] <arthurvr> however I don't know how many times/when that fires
[06:21:14] <arthurvr> Paradisee ^
[06:21:52] <Paradisee> i solved ty anyway
[06:29:16] <blackkbot> input would be the event
[06:29:27] <blackkbot> for an input slider
[06:30:38] <Paradisee> that kind of slider doesnt work on mobile....how can i fix it? http://jqueryui.com/slider/#slider-vertical
[06:31:17] <arthurvr> thanks arschmitz!
[06:31:56] <arschmitz> arthurvr: no problem
[06:32:05] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: Now we just have to hope they read it.
[06:32:33] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: you never know
[06:33:15] <BillCriswell> I have faith.
[06:43:21] <arschmitz> arthurvr: BillCriswell unless im mistaken #jquerymobile-dev should have redirected to #jqueryui-dev anyway
[06:46:03] <arthurvr> yeah
[06:46:20] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: This channel is he only one I'm in often.
[06:46:32] <BillCriswell> Well, jQuery related anyway.
[06:46:58] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: yeah i just meant in regards to that it was still in the topic
[06:47:11] <arschmitz> no one should have ever been in a dead channel
[06:47:11] <BillCriswell> Ahhh, got it. 8-)
[07:02:51] <khazad-dum> hello
[07:04:00] <arthurvr> hi!
[07:07:39] <DevAntoine> ain't .find($foo) (where $foo = $('.foo')) the same thing as .find('.foo')? The first one doesn't return anything while the second form works
[07:13:07] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: No.
[07:13:58] <arthurvr> arschmitz: BillCriswell: Another thing: is there a reason the `#jquery-developer-summit` still exists?
[07:14:04] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Wait, might be wrong.
[07:14:07] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: why so? The doc states the same
[07:14:19] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I have no idea haha
[07:14:21] <DevAntoine> ype: Selector A string containing a selector expression to match elements against.
[07:14:25] <DevAntoine> Type: Element or jQuery An element or a jQuery object to match elements against.
[07:14:27] <arschmitz> arthurvr: in case we do another one
[07:14:33] <arthurvr> Iarschmitz: BillCriswell: it has been inactive for at least months
[07:14:34] <DevAntoine> but this is not working as expected
[07:14:46] <shoky> DevAntoine: they should only be the same if you ran  $foo = $('.foo')  right before doing .find($foo)
[07:15:15] <arthurvr> arschmitz: BillCriswell: I mean we should mark it as inactive on irc.jquery.org than too
[07:15:31] <arthurvr> arschmitz: BillCriswell: like we did here https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org/issues/10
[07:16:15] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: http://jsbin.com/ruwuq/1/edit?html,js,output this works.
[07:16:24] <arschmitz> arthurvr: sure ajpiano would be te guy to ask about that
[07:16:25] <DevAntoine> shoky: oh yeah, that's my issue I guess
[07:16:53] <arthurvr> arschmitz: BillCriswell: I'il post it in the issue ;-)
[07:17:21] <BillCriswell> Never knew find had that ability.
[07:18:00] <BillCriswell> Seems useful now that I'm thinking about it more... but I've never needed it before.
[07:18:23] <DevAntoine> I wanted to transform this selector: $('.search', '.foo') to $foo.find($search) to factorize my selectors
[07:19:45] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: I don't really follow, but I'm not much of a word guy either haha
[07:19:50] <BillCriswell> Glad it works, though.
[07:20:51] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: well, your use case works, yeah. But mine is a little more complex: when the dom is loaded the $foo selector doesn't match everything at that time, because some html is not parsed. I'm parsing the extra html in a function, the same where I wanna use .find($foo)
[07:21:12] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[07:22:17] <DevAntoine> this is my function: http://pastebin.com/mcn06ATr
[07:22:26] <DevAntoine> as you can see, $tpl is the parsed html
[07:24:27] <Omar-> DevAntoine why not $tableProductTpl.find($unitHolder)?
[07:24:49] <DevAntoine> Omar-: because at this point it's just text
[07:24:55] <DevAntoine> it's a template stored in a script tag
[07:25:26] <Omar-> mustache, handlebars?
[07:26:01] <DevAntoine> Omar-: john reisig micro templating
[07:26:44] <Omar-> interesting
[07:26:53] <BillCriswell> Why this: $tableProductTpl[0].innerHTML = $tpl[0].outerHTML; over .html() ?
[07:26:59] <BillCriswell> Just curious is all.
[07:27:20] <Omar-> sounds like a liquor name haha
[07:28:04] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1956#issuecomment-68286347
[07:28:23] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: I still need to find time to explain more my issue
[07:28:46] <DevAntoine> but now, I don't know how to do it with my function to avoid copy/pasting selectors
[07:28:59] <shoky> ah if you're doing .find on just an html snippet then obviously it won't find any elements that are _actually_ in the DOM  (like elements in $('.discountUnit') )
[07:29:09] <Omar-> DevAntoine I remember that issue now
[07:29:28] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Sure you don't mean to be typing type="text/template"?
[07:29:28] <shoky> why not just store the string selector instead of doing a DOM query
[07:29:50] <shoky> e.g. unitHolder = '.discountUnit';
[07:29:59] <shoky> $tpl.find(unitHolder)
[07:31:26] <DevAntoine> shoky: yep, I'll do that
[07:31:55] <shoky> oh but you've got $unitHolder.text(unit);    not sure how that fits in...
[07:31:57] <DevAntoine> shoky: why obviously?
[07:31:58] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: I don't think you mean to be doing <script type="text/html"> for your templates.
[07:32:09] <shoky> your code doesn't make sense to me
[07:32:22] <DevAntoine> shoky: $(unitHolder) I guess
[07:32:40] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: why?
[07:32:47] <DevAntoine> shoky: why?
[07:33:08] <shoky> DevAntoine: var foo = $(someHtml);    foo is not in the DOM, nor are any of its descendants
[07:34:07] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: I just researched a bit and it seems ok. I misspoke.
[07:34:09] <shoky> it's just a DOM fragment in the air.  so looking in it for elements that are in the actual DOM tree, won't find anything
[07:34:20] <DevAntoine> shoky: are you talking of the github issue?
[07:34:31] <shoky> DevAntoine: just your pastebin
[07:35:28] <DevAntoine> shoky: that's why it's in a jQuery selector
[07:35:37] <DevAntoine> like this I can have an object with all my html parsed
[07:35:49] <shoky> DevAntoine: donno what you mean
[07:36:50] <shoky> it's fine to have that $tpl like you're doing. but it's not fine to do a .find(stuffInActualDom)  on it. because it doesnt have anything that's in the actual DOM. it's just some html you parsed
[07:38:28] <shoky> doing $($tableProductTpl.html())   jquery/browser doesn't care that the html happened to have come from somewhere in the DOM. it's just an html string that you're parsing
[07:38:37] <DevAntoine> shoky: I still don't see the issue. I can still use find on something which is not in the dom
[07:38:53] <shoky> sure you can, but not .find(somethingInTheActualDom)
[07:38:59] <DevAntoine> $('<div>') returns a new div, not inserted in the dom, where you can do everything you want with it
[07:39:12] <shoky> not look in it for things that are in the actual DOM
[07:39:47] <DevAntoine> I've fixed my issue anyway: http://pastebin.com/VdjJmLRz
[07:39:50] <DevAntoine> works like a charm
[07:39:50] <shoky> var div = $('<div>');  var inActualDom = $('.something');    div.find(inActualDom)  will always not find anything
[07:41:13] <BillCriswell> Ah, that makes it clear haha
[07:41:27] <ganicus555> hello
[07:41:44] <shoky> DevAntoine: that doesn't fully work. $(unitHolder).text(unit);   doesn't do anything to the unitHolder element inside $tpl
[07:42:36] <shoky> DevAntoine: ah but you can just delete that line
[07:42:40] <DevAntoine> shoky: it does
[07:42:48] <shoky> DevAntoine: no it doesn't, the next line does
[07:42:55] <DevAntoine> yah, that's my point
[07:43:03] <shoky> so, you can delete that line
[07:43:17] <shoky> it'll just affect any other unitHolders you have in the DOM, you don't watn that
[07:43:47] <DevAntoine> well, you don't have the whole context, I may have other elements matching the unitHolder selector, in the dom ;
[07:43:48] <DevAntoine> ;)
[07:43:58] <DevAntoine> yes, I want that
[07:44:05] <shoky> oh you want all to change? oks
[07:44:14] <DevAntoine> I want to edit the actual dom AND the template
[07:44:46] <shoky> well you can just do $(unitHolder).text(unit)  after setting the .innerHTML
[07:44:56] <shoky> and delete the .find  line
[07:45:12] <DevAntoine> shoky: nop, because what's inside a script tag ain't parsed as html
[07:45:30] <shoky> ah gotcha
[07:45:55] <DevAntoine> the workflow is: transform the text inside the script to a jquery element containing the parsed html, edit that html, then set it back inside the script tag
[07:46:24] <shoky> sounds gross ;)
[07:46:25] <DevAntoine> shoky: but thanks for your wondering :)
[07:46:41] <DevAntoine> shoky: it is but I havn't any better solution at the moment, nor any more time for it
[07:47:07] <shoky> oh well
[08:08:59] <Omar-> too quiet
[08:09:08] <Omar-> like a library
[08:13:48] <ntcbow> people *read the topic :D
[08:19:47] <MikeD_> i read the topic, what do you mean?
[08:24:02] <ntcbow> nobody asks stupid questions he/her could find out himself in a second
[08:24:18] <ntcbow> resp herself
[08:24:43] <ntcbow> soo, its quiet, too quiet, like in a library
[08:24:52] <ntcbow> psst
[08:25:01] <ntcbow> :)
[08:25:21] <_DB> is there anyway to center a image in the center of the screen depending on the position of my scroll bars?
[08:25:22] <_DB> im trying to make a loading bar but im having problems centering it
[08:25:52] <Omar-> _DB CSS is your friend
[08:25:59] <_DB> for example when I say margin top some percentage the page isnt the same size for everyone
[08:26:06] <_DB> so it has issues
[08:26:31] <Omar-> .loader { position: absolute; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0; margin:auto; }
[08:26:38] <Omar-> dont forget to add height and width
[08:27:04] <_DB> oh
[08:27:06] <ntcbow> maybe rather position: fixed?
[08:27:10] <_DB> alright
[08:27:12] <Omar-> this will center any div in spite of viewport/browser
[08:28:39] <Omar-> _DB http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/61f77mcp/
[08:29:47] <_DB> thanks a bunch
[08:29:58] <Omar-> no problems :)
[08:30:34] <XtenPhi> guys!!
[08:31:04] <XtenPhi> How can I select all what have specific class without affect another rules
[08:31:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.classname')
[08:31:33] <XtenPhi> some like $("*.classname*")
[08:31:41] <XtenPhi> something like this is posible?
[08:31:49] <robertmaxrees> that would select every element with that classname.
[08:37:23] <ntcbow> _DB: http://jsfiddle.net/03L2mL9g/
[08:44:59] <roue> hola
[08:45:18] <XtenPhi> Why in my table paginating of 10 records when I add an event listener at specific row works perfect less the last row
[08:45:23] <XtenPhi> roue : hola
[08:45:41] <robertmaxrees> XtenPhi huh?
[08:45:52] <robertmaxrees> XtenPhi is an event listener not working on new things you're adding?
[08:46:07] <XtenPhi> just the last thing
[08:46:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[08:46:14] <roue> I'm new to jquery. I'd like to use it to create a page that displays a sortable table I can update dynamically via a service that returns row data in json format. There seem to be a lot of plugin options. Can anyone recommend one rather than my sifting ignorantly through them ? :) Thanks.
[08:46:23] <XtenPhi> $('table.jtable > tbody > .jtable-data-row td:eq(11) > button').css('background', '#0F0');
[08:46:40] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ XtenPhi
[08:46:41] <b-ot> XtenPhi: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:47:00] <XtenPhi> that for example change the background of that td less the last vertically
[08:47:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:48:05] <XtenPhi> http://i.imgur.com/2dURapL.png
[08:48:06] <XtenPhi> this
[08:48:15] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle please.
[08:48:16] <XtenPhi> and the nex page too
[08:48:37] <robertmaxrees> how am I supposed to help if I have no idea what your html looks like?
[08:49:18] <XtenPhi> http://jsfiddle.net/cLz4kzcw/
[08:49:30] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help me at all.
[08:49:39] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[08:49:41] <arthurvr> yeah but that's a paste from your code
[08:49:48] <arthurvr> not a reduced test case
[08:50:21] <XtenPhi> http://jsfiddle.net/cLz4kzcw/1/
[08:50:34] <arthurvr> that's even worse
[08:50:46] <arthurvr> Once again that's a quick paste not a testcase
[08:50:56] <ntcbow> }//]]>
[08:51:02] <arthurvr> + it's pasted in the wrong places
[09:24:35] <alexclark> anyone up for some pretty obscure troubleshooting that only happens in mobile?
[09:25:16] <robertmaxrees> just ask - if somebody can help, they will.
[09:26:46] <alexclark> ok, so I have a fixed header for a single page style site.  It has active classes for the current section and you can click the links to bring you to an anchor
[09:27:03] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ alexclark
[09:27:04] <b-ot> alexclark: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:27:56] <alexclark> the problem that is only in mobile is if you click one of these links the class will never get removed by scrolling
[09:28:53] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: i have a link to the site if youd like that
[09:29:18] <robertmaxrees> a small test-case would be best.
[09:29:26] <robertmaxrees> but share whatever you want out to the channel.
[09:29:44] <alexclark> http://vandegrift.wpengine.com/
[09:31:25] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: a lot of moving pieces, i dont think a jsbin is best suited for this
[09:31:39] <robertmaxrees> for a small self-contained example it is ;)
[09:34:49] <PenguinMan98> Is anybody here who can help me with datatables?
[09:35:07] <robertmaxrees> PenguinMan98 you might get help
[09:35:14] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Still being a pain in the ass?
[09:35:25] <PenguinMan98> Yeah
[09:35:33] <PenguinMan98> I've tried a few different ways now
[09:35:47] <PenguinMan98> I found something that looked hopeful: https://datatables.net/reference/api/filter%28%29
[09:36:15] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Yeah I recall this.
[09:36:28] <PenguinMan98> So I wrote a function that way
[09:36:36] <PenguinMan98> And it is called whenever I change the dates
[09:36:42] <PenguinMan98> It correctly returns true/false
[09:36:42] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Didn't .search() or whatever make more sense to use?
[09:36:59] <PenguinMan98> But it doesn't actually filter
[09:40:28] <PenguinMan98> output: http://screencast.com/t/URMnTB3T
[09:41:59] <PenguinMan98> Code: http://pastebin.com/zzCC3xRX
[09:42:29] <xpheres> does anyone has an idea why a texarea in a form does not work in bootstrap?
[09:42:40] <xpheres> and it works outside bootstrap
[09:43:07] <PenguinMan98> xpheres: Try renaming the input?
[09:43:42] <xpheres> ok
[09:43:47] <xpheres> you think that can solve it?
[09:44:16] <PenguinMan98> Its possible the field has a name collision with something in bootstrap. It's not common, but it's something to check
[09:44:24] <xpheres> ah right
[09:44:25] <xpheres> let me check
[09:46:01] <NoiseEee> xpheres: what does "a texarea in a form does not work" even mean?
[09:46:49] <xpheres> hei
[09:46:54] <xpheres> penguiman98
[09:46:58] <xpheres> that solved the problem
[09:47:12] <xpheres> it seems that the name "#message" does not work in bootstrap
[09:47:27] <PenguinMan98> NoiseEee: My guess is that a 'textarea' is being referenced by id when a form is submitted. Without bootstrap, it grabs the id just fine but with bootstrap, it fails.  I guessed that there was a name collision.
[09:47:27] <Paradisee> why am i not able to add the button var inside the tr ?http://dpaste.com/2HZS95E
[09:47:40] <PenguinMan98> xpheres: Great!  Glad it was a simple thing
[09:48:15] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: the class property actually has to be in quotes
[09:48:29] <xpheres> yeah
[09:48:32] <PenguinMan98> Paradisee: are you using a <td> inside that <tr>?
[09:48:40] <Paradisee> yes?
[09:48:52] <xpheres> I was breaking my head to solve such a stupid problem
[09:48:55] <Paradisee> i have to make a grid
[09:49:04] <NoiseEee> 'class':'btn btn-default btn-xs'  , not class:'btn btn-default btn-xs' @ Paradisee
[09:49:13] <NoiseEee> its a special word
[09:49:34] <Paradisee> nope
[09:50:41] <Paradisee> how can i solve it?
[09:50:49] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: you're mixing DOM element and strings
[09:50:58] <NoiseEee> var tr = '<tr>' + td_room + td_in_value + td_out_value + button + '</tr>';
[09:51:02] <PenguinMan98> BillCriswell: The filter()DT method provides a way of filtering out content in an API instance's result set which does not pass the criteria set by the provided callback method. This method should not be confused with search()DT which is used to search for records in the DataTable.
[09:51:30] <NoiseEee> so "<tr>" is a string, but "button" is a DOM element.
[09:51:46] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Yeah I remember reading that.
[09:51:47] <Paradisee> so? how do i solve?
[09:52:08] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: use all strings or all dom elements, strings are likely easier at this point in your code
[09:52:27] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: ie: all "html markup" or all DOM elements
[09:52:32] <PenguinMan98> BillCriswell: So, given that I want to filter out content that doesn't match a criteria, it seems that filter() is the way to go, not .search().  I could be wrong though.
[09:53:43] <Paradisee> it gives me: [object Object]
[09:54:03] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: YEah I just remember talking about this with you before and I think we decided search would be better? I'm not sure I remember right, though.
[09:54:20] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: are you familiar with javascript or jquery?
[09:54:26] <PenguinMan98> Well, it is something I haven't tried yet
[09:54:51] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'm thinking a different PenguinMan98 haha
[09:55:17] <PenguinMan98> No I remember us discussing it. I just didnt' try it then
[09:55:30] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: use all strings or all dom elements, strings are likely easier at this point in your code.   and change the methods.  for example, $('#table-content').append(tr); would become $('#table-content').html(tr); assuming your <tr> was fixed as a proper string beforehand
[09:55:55] <NoiseEee> mind you that would overwrite the existing <tr>s but you get my point Paradisee... DOM or strings.
[09:55:56] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Still have a fiddle somewhere?
[09:57:28] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2RXHBCK
[09:57:31] <Paradisee> ugly like hell
[09:58:24] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: well yeah if you want to do it all in one line like that, ugly. but again, you'd not use the "append" method because that's for DOM elements
[09:59:10] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: but you *could* $('#table-content').append($(row));
[09:59:13] <Paradisee> isnt a better way to make it ?
[10:01:08] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: its up to you, any better way in my opinion would be a more 'readable' way
[10:01:43] <Paradisee> what a discovery
[10:01:45] <NoiseEee> maybe pushing each 'line' of markup into an array to be joined and appended, for example
[10:02:08] <PenguinMan98> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/tpv3eakn/15/
[10:02:15] <NoiseEee> or, go all DOM elements, whatever your style guide is etc... just be consistent Paradisee
[10:02:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[10:06:15] <PenguinMan98> $('sometable').html('tr').html( td_room.html() + td_in_value.html() + td_out_value.html() + button.html() );
[10:06:24] <PenguinMan98> perhaps
[10:06:36] <robertmaxrees> that's hard to read and awkward.
[10:06:52] <PenguinMan98> Agreed
[10:06:57] <PenguinMan98> but it does solve the problem
[10:07:12] <PenguinMan98> At least for adding a single row
[10:07:29] <robertmaxrees> don't exacerbate code readability problems.
[10:07:39] <PenguinMan98> heh
[10:09:18] <Paradisee> how can i put underscores automatically when i have a string like: "hi i am carlo" it should be ->> "hi_i_am_carlo"
[10:09:43] <PenguinMan98> textString.replace( ' ', '_' );?
[10:10:19] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: these are some pretty basic javascript methods
[10:10:25] <pentagrass> How would I change an element's hover style?
[10:10:37] <Paradisee> NoiseEee: if it was python was a joke
[10:10:40] <Paradisee> but it isnt
[10:10:55] <Paradisee> is there any function to make it like replace?
[10:10:58] <PenguinMan98> $('#someElem').style( 'hover', "some hover sytle" );
[10:11:14] <BillCriswell> Would need to actually do / /g, '_'
[10:11:18] <pentagrass> PenguinMan98: you da man!
[10:11:37] <BillCriswell> I don't think he's right though... lol
[10:11:44] <PenguinMan98> yeah, it was a WAG
[10:12:20] <BillCriswell> Paradisee: string.replace(/\s/g, '_');
[10:12:27] <Paradisee> already solved
[10:12:28] <Paradisee> ty
[10:12:35] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:13:01] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: I don't think you can modify that through JS (without writing out CSS).
[10:13:08] <PenguinMan98> pentagrass: $('#someElem:hover').style( 'styletochange', "new value");
[10:13:39] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: Think you mean .css() instead of .style()
[10:13:44] <BillCriswell> but still not sure that works.
[10:13:51] <PenguinMan98> Oh right
[10:13:54] <PenguinMan98> Yeah.  .css
[10:14:04] <PenguinMan98> *facepalm*
[10:14:25] <pentagrass> PenguinMan98: I'm starting to think you are not da man... :/
[10:14:54] <PenguinMan98> I'm an enthusiastic idiot with just enough experience to THINK I know what I'm talking about.
[10:15:13] <PenguinMan98> ;)
[10:15:23] <pentagrass> :P you still da man for being honest
[10:15:40] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: The closest you can come is like.. $('.foo').on('mouseenter', function () { $(this).css('foo', 'bar'); }).on('mouseleave', function () { $(this).css('foo', 'baz'); });... but you should really just use CSS.
[10:16:39] <pentagrass> BillCriswell: I think I know what to do in my situation. i'll just override the element with a custom hover style in my page
[10:16:54] <pentagrass> override the "style", rather
[10:17:13] <PenguinMan98> pentagrass: Following BillCriswell 's method, define a #someElem.class1:hover{} and a #someElem.class2:hover{} and then use jquery to switch classes on('mouseover' ?
[10:18:29] <PenguinMan98> Or yeah, just give the target an #id and write a #id:hover{} !important
[10:25:04] <PenguinMan98> So yeah, http://jsfiddle.net/tpv3eakn/16/ This looks like it SHOULD work
[10:25:07] <PenguinMan98> but it doesn't
[10:25:59] <TeddyMurray> does .on() work for dynamically added elements?
[10:26:05] <TeddyMurray> ive always used live and delegate
[10:26:10] <TeddyMurray> just learning its deprecated
[10:26:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:26:27] <robertmaxrees> need to use delegation.
[10:26:34] <robertmaxrees> which is easil done with .on()
[10:27:00] <PenguinMan98> .. wait, what?
[10:27:20] <robertmaxrees> you can use event delegation with .on()
[10:27:27] <robertmaxrees> (talking to TeddyMurray)
[10:27:46] <decx> are you people actually at work?
[10:27:55] <TeddyMurray> $("#tasks button").on("click",function () { like this?
[10:27:59] <TeddyMurray> decx, i work at home
[10:28:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:28:02] <PenguinMan98> yeah. It just looked like he asked "Can I use .on()" and you said "No. but you can easily use .on()"
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> PenguinMan98 it doesn't automatically bind to newly created elements.
[10:28:26] <robertmaxrees> but you can use event delegation so that doesn't matter.
[10:28:42] <robertmaxrees> $('#tasks').on('click', 'button', function() {}); - TeddyMurray
[10:28:50] <TeddyMurray> ah okay, yeah just saw it in the docs
[10:28:53] <TeddyMurray> thanks robertmaxrees
[10:28:57] <BillCriswell> Man, there is nothing jQuery like about DataTables.
[10:29:29] <PenguinMan98> BillCriswell: I don't understand it well enough to know either way
[10:30:10] <robertmaxrees> the API seems really unusual imo.
[10:30:20] <PenguinMan98> Alls I know is that this is my highest priority and I just can't get it to work right
[10:32:14] <PenguinMan98> <Beavis> And it sucks!  And we're never gonna score!  ... and it sucks!  and we're never gonna score!  .... ... and it sucks!
[10:32:59] <BillCriswell> I miss Beaver and Butthead, as my grandmom called them.
[10:33:13] <robertmaxrees> i just watched that christmas special.
[10:33:24] <robertmaxrees> "Hah.  Bumhug."
[10:33:31] <PenguinMan98> lol
[10:33:41] <decx> beaver and butthead are a fleshlight/dildo pairing
[10:34:11] <PenguinMan98> "Well, THAT escalated quickly."
[10:34:44] <pentagrass> Is there a selector for two classes? I have class 'foo' and 'bar'.. I tried: $(".foo .bar") but obviously that didn't work
[10:34:53] <decx> .foo.bar
[10:34:54] <PenguinMan98> use a comma
[10:35:07] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:35:17] <robertmaxrees> that selects ".foo OR .bar"
[10:35:18] <PenguinMan98> .foo,.bar will select all elements with one or the other.
[10:35:18] <pentagrass> ilol
[10:35:22] <robertmaxrees> .foo.bar is both
[10:35:30] <pentagrass> .foo,.bar ?
[10:35:36] <robertmaxrees> drop the comma
[10:35:36] <BillCriswell> There you go.
[10:35:46] <pentagrass> comma worked!!!
[10:35:54] * PenguinMan98 puts a point on the board!
[10:36:00] <robertmaxrees> i thought you wanted all elements with both classes.
[10:36:00] <pentagrass> PenguinMan98: once again you are da man
[10:36:12] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: sry for the confusion
[10:36:13] <PenguinMan98> woooo! *happy dance*
[10:36:21] <robertmaxrees> s'all good
[10:36:22] <StanAccy> Im trying to use .wrap() to wrap some HTML around an element.  The HTML I want to add is: <h1>Test</h1><div></div>  where the selected element gets inserted in between the div tags, but jquery seems to be taking the closing </h1> as the insertion point - can I avoid this?
[10:36:52] <PenguinMan98> StanAccy: try .prepend()?
[10:37:19] <PenguinMan98> oh wait
[10:37:19] <StanAccy> PenguinMan98: and .append() - that could work.  Thanks
[10:37:31] <PenguinMan98> append will work to put the h1 after the div
[10:37:41] <PenguinMan98> prepend could put the h1 before the div
[10:37:53] <StanAccy> Im basically decorating an existing <div> with some popup titling and close links
[10:38:09] <StanAccy> and wrapping the entire thing inside another <div> so that I can style accordingly
[10:38:20] <PenguinMan98> so .append( h1 ) . append( div )
[10:38:33] <decx> $(selector).before('<h1>').wrap('<div>')
[10:38:45] <decx> that'll wrap your thing and put a h1 before that
[10:39:01] <StanAccy> and then wrap that entire thing in a containing <div>, thanks
[10:39:20] <StanAccy> so there's no avoiding the wrap() methods interpreation of the close tags
[10:39:22] <PenguinMan98> or even $( '#outerDiv').html( '<h1>test</h1><div>' + stuff + '</div>');
[10:39:33] <StanAccy> I dont have outerdiv - thats being added :-)
[10:39:43] <StanAccy> Ive only got the target div to wrap around
[10:39:52] <PenguinMan98> oic
[10:40:06] <StanAccy> Im basically saying "Take this existing <div> and make it look all nice n fancy"
[10:40:08] <decx> as long as you do before() before .wrap() then your before() won't be wrapped
[10:41:22] <decx> that's a mouthful
[10:41:59] <pdcmoreira> lool
[10:42:12] <pdcmoreira> amazing phrase
[10:43:05] <pdcmoreira> would it be too bad if i asked a bootstrap question here? bootstrap channel is dead
[10:43:10] <StanAccy> bah, this still isnt working. Let me create a jsfiddle
[10:47:08] <StanAccy> ok, please take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/6rqqefjo/5/   - why is the "before()
[10:47:16] <StanAccy> content being closed off before the .after() runs ?
[10:48:09] <decx> so i gave you the answer and you ignored it
[10:48:14] <decx> thanks brah
[10:48:42] <StanAccy> decx: one sec - that wasnt working for me - I tried to simplify the fiddle
[10:49:01] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/6rqqefjo/6/
[10:49:29] <StanAccy> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/6rqqefjo/7/
[10:49:59] <decx> dont piecemeal your markup
[10:50:05] <StanAccy> decx: Thats not quite the same - Im wrapping the whole h1 with another div
[10:50:13] <decx> that wasn't in your spec
[10:50:39] <decx> switch wrap with before to wrap all
[10:50:55] <robertmaxrees> i feel like we need to add a rule about changing the question after somebody has hanswered you.
[10:51:06] <decx> football to the groin
[10:51:09] <StanAccy> hey hang ion - I did say that I was wrapping the whole thing
[10:51:11] * PenguinMan98 wonders how often hanswers happen
[10:51:14] <StanAccy> 13:38
[10:51:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:51:27] <robertmaxrees> that was almost a day ago now.
[10:51:30] <decx> more often in #jquery.es PenguinMan98
[10:52:07] <PenguinMan98> heh
[10:52:17] <robertmaxrees> decx is good people.
[10:52:23] <decx> we agree
[10:52:25] <StanAccy> when I use before() to try and put elements in there, it looks like jquery is closing off my open html elements
[10:52:42] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy you can only deal with full fragments, not partial ones.
[10:53:17] <StanAccy> so I have to do this piecemeal then
[10:53:26] <decx> no
[10:53:30] <StanAccy> wrap the inner div, then stick in a before() on the inner div
[10:53:31] <decx> like i said
[10:53:32] <decx> switch
[10:53:35] <decx> $('.wrapme').wrap('<div class="wrapper">').before( '<h1>Test</h1>' );
[10:53:37] <PenguinMan98> So, can anybody help me get in touch with the guys who make datatables? Or should I post this question up on StackExchange?
[10:53:47] <StanAccy> PenguinMan98: datatables.net ?
[10:53:49] <robertmaxrees> PenguinMan98 they have a forum.
[10:54:04] <PenguinMan98> awww.. forums. bleh
[10:54:07] <PenguinMan98> hehe
[10:54:10] <robertmaxrees> i suggested they make an IRC channel and they shot the idea down.
[10:54:35] <StanAccy> decx: Thanks - thats it. Much appreciated.
[10:56:10] <decx> when you build your markup with these methods then jquery will use document.createElement and not do a long html string where you can prepend and append opening and closing tags, that's what caused your problems
[10:56:23] <BillCriswell> What is this 2000?
[10:56:30] <robertmaxrees> plebs
[10:56:44] <decx> yeah a forum lol
[10:56:49] <decx> it's obviously the 80s
[10:56:55] <decx> because we're on irc
[10:56:58] <robertmaxrees> lols
[10:57:17] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: What else are you doing with DataTables? Cause I'd be tempted to just do it with plain jQuery at this point.
[10:57:17] <BillCriswell> Fuck all this noise.
[10:57:46] <PenguinMan98> Well, I tried a custom solution first
[10:57:55] <decx> not underscore?
[10:57:59] <PenguinMan98> I hit into too many problems
[10:58:31] <PenguinMan98> DataTables fixed 5/6 requirements right off the bat
[10:58:34] <BillCriswell> What other features of datatables are you using?
[10:58:41] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Ahhh, bummer.
[10:58:48] <PenguinMan98> The filtering, the pagination, etc.
[10:58:53] <PenguinMan98> sorting
[10:58:56] <robertmaxrees> we should make a DT alternative.
[10:59:12] <StanAccy> decx: So is doing what Im doing with wrap() and .before() the best way to achieve this?
[10:59:14] <PenguinMan98> The last one is just the f**ng date filter which SHOULD be easy
[10:59:47] <StanAccy> datatables is great :-0
[10:59:49] <decx> i dont know if it's the best way. but it's sane
[11:00:16] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/47182351/Grid-Widget
[11:00:56] <BillCriswell> The internet at work today has been an average of like.... 15 second load times.
[11:01:14] <robertmaxrees> arschmitz++
[11:01:30] <BillCriswell> Looks like a good jump off point.
[11:01:52] <BillCriswell> and it's done jQuerily.. which is a lot more than I can say for data tables.
[11:02:03] <PenguinMan98> wow, cool
[11:02:46] <PenguinMan98> Can I have multiple instances runnign in the same DOM?
[11:04:14] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: I've never come across this at any point in my jQuery help. I find that odd.
[11:06:06] <BillCriswell> Oh.. maybe cause I can't figure out how to download it haha
[11:06:36] <PenguinMan98> At the veeeeery bottom it says: 'there are no plans to continue but you can get the latest version here _____
[11:07:11] <BillCriswell> Ah, there it goes.
[11:07:28] <mvpgraff> Hello all
[11:07:32] <PenguinMan98> fork me baby fork me!@
[11:07:53] * PenguinMan98 snickers
[11:09:38] <BillCriswell> Someone got in trouble for saying that a while ago at a conference.
[11:09:54] <BillCriswell> Well, something similar.
[11:10:16] <BillCriswell> "I'd let him fork my repo" I think was a quote... it was such a mess over a dumb little joke.
[11:10:37] <mvpgraff> really? lol
[11:10:59] <mvpgraff> some people just can't handle forks.
[11:11:28] <PenguinMan98> wow
[11:11:38] <PenguinMan98> forkheads
[11:12:14] <PenguinMan98> But yeah, I can see the value in keeping conferences a bit more professional
[11:12:23] <PenguinMan98> just a little bit
[11:12:31] <PenguinMan98> https://github.com/fnagel/jQuery-Accessible-RIA
[11:12:45] <PenguinMan98> Found that on his page.  not sure what it all entails
[11:14:26] <bbclover> hey guys when was .on() added to jquery? Can I use it with jquery 1.3.1?
[11:14:57] <PenguinMan98> but the long and short of my problem is this: I have a lot of tabular data.  My requirements are : search it, sort it, date range it, keep the headers visible.
[11:14:58] <robertmaxrees> chgeck the docs :)
[11:15:08] <robertmaxrees> bbclover the docs tell you when things were added.
[11:15:22] <decx> in the second sentence even
[11:15:23] <PenguinMan98> chgeck sounds like something they do before a Geico commercial
[11:15:33] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[11:15:43] <bbclover> oh I see. 1.7. I looked at the docs but didn't see it on first glance
[11:15:54] <robertmaxrees> 1.3 is ancient
[11:16:09] <decx> yeah 1.3 is pretty old
[11:16:17] <decx> you have to spline in frog dna to actually use it
[11:16:20] <PenguinMan98> When I inherited the project, it already had searching and sorting.
[11:16:28] <PenguinMan98> I added a date filter and all was well with the world
[11:16:49] <PenguinMan98> Then came the problem of keeping the headers visible
[11:17:24] <PenguinMan98> I tried at LEAST 10 different plugins/methods for popping the header row up out of the table to follow the user down the page.
[11:17:41] <PenguinMan98> None of them brought happiness
[11:17:53] <decx> you dont detach the table header
[11:18:01] <PenguinMan98> Some of them do
[11:18:05] <decx> you create a separate floating header
[11:18:12] <PenguinMan98> That's what the rest do
[11:18:14] <bbclover> yeah this application is really old
[11:18:15] <decx> the would reflow the entire table
[11:18:21] <decx> that*
[11:19:16] <PenguinMan98> So I switched to datatables
[11:19:23] <PenguinMan98> that fixed teh header thing by adding pagination
[11:19:28] <PenguinMan98> but now the date filters don't work
[11:19:33] <PenguinMan98> bbl
[11:23:04] <d4rklit3> hi
[11:23:28] <d4rklit3> having some problems with appending elements to the page. when I append an element it and it increases the document height it scrolls to top of page.
[11:24:23] <d4rklit3> is that what it's supposed to do?
[11:24:56] <BillCriswell> d4rklit3: It sounds like you might be clicking a link to add the elements?
[11:25:14] <BillCriswell> So are you going to like page.html# ?
[11:25:21] <d4rklit3> no
[11:25:24] <d4rklit3> no hash or anything
[11:25:32] <d4rklit3> using masonry though, so its the masonry way to add them
[11:25:41] <d4rklit3> but it was happening without masonry too
[11:25:44] <BillCriswell> Oh... dunno then without a demo.
[11:46:16] <Tomashe> hey guys, wondering how can i re-init a plugin like that when i want, cuz my dom is dynamicly changeing and that plugin only init once when the page is loading and on the eleements that being on the screen. any suggestions ?
[11:46:17] <Tomashe> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nckprsn/scrollme/master/jquery.scrollme.js
[11:49:21] <ganicus555> question regarding jquery?
[11:49:25] <ganicus555> can i ask anyone?
[11:49:30] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ ganicus555
[11:49:30] <b-ot> ganicus555: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:50:56] <ganicus555> why do you need a js framework ?
[11:51:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery is more of a library.
[11:51:18] <robertmaxrees> and it's so you don't have to solve problems yourself.
[11:52:56] <ganicus555> and regarding other frameworks such as angular and and backbone, when do u have the need to use those ?
[11:53:06] <robertmaxrees> when you want data binding.
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> MV* style
[11:53:41] <robertmaxrees> and you don't want to roll it on your own.
[11:54:04] <ganicus555> like form data binding ?
[11:54:20] <robertmaxrees> like any kind of data binding.  anything you want MV* style structure for.
[11:54:45] <ganicus555> Kinda like the Django forms?
[11:54:53] <robertmaxrees> sort of, but in your frontent.
[11:54:55] <robertmaxrees> *frontend
[11:55:33] <ganicus555> so its basically a method of doing it in frontend instead of backend?
[11:55:38] <thinkxl> django controllers are diferent, even their MVC concept is different
[11:56:04] <thinkxl> ganicus555: is for manipulating most of your app in the front-end using MVC pattern
[11:56:05] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 you'd still have some kind of backend architecture as well.
[11:56:09] <thinkxl> and using back-end only for storing data
[11:56:14] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[11:56:33] <thinkxl> ganicus555: you do all your shit in the front-end and just query data from the back-end
[11:56:50] <thinkxl> so for manipulating views, routes and all that stuff you use MVC pattern
[11:56:55] <thinkxl> in the front-end
[11:57:07] <robertmaxrees> your backend also has to implement some of that functionality, too.
[11:57:22] <thinkxl> the endpoints of course
[11:57:33] <ganicus555> isnt putting ur logic and most of your code on your backend better?
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 define "better"
[11:57:42] <thinkxl> ganicus555: it depends on what your app does
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> thinkxl you also have to consider SEO implications, though that's less and less of a concern.
[11:57:57] <robertmaxrees> also, fallbacks.
[11:58:03] <thinkxl> well, yes
[11:58:05] <ganicus555> I mean there's a big tradeoff when you put all your code on the client side
[11:58:15] <thinkxl> ganicus555: it depends
[11:58:20] <thinkxl> there are not absolutes
[11:58:26] <thinkxl> ganicus555: see gmail
[11:58:33] <thinkxl> or wunderlist
[11:58:34] <ganicus555> also for me , 3 hours of JS = 15 min python
[11:58:50] <thinkxl> haah funny
[11:58:59] <thinkxl> 3 hours of python = 15 mins in js
[11:58:59] <thinkxl> for me
[11:59:05] <ganicus555> lol
[11:59:15] <thinkxl> you can use flask to do a restful api
[11:59:22] <thinkxl> and use backbone in the front-end
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 there's no absolute in that case.
[11:59:53] <robertmaxrees> the "tradeoff" is ambiguous.
[11:59:55] <thinkxl> also, the user management is trickier using the front-end approach
[12:00:13] <robertmaxrees> just a different set of considerations.
[12:00:17] <thinkxl> yup
[12:00:38] <ganicus555> flask?
[12:00:47] <thinkxl> you use python and don;t know flaskÇ
[12:00:58] <thinkxl> you live under a rock?
[12:01:17] <stompdaroach> HOW DID YOU KNOW
[12:01:23] <ganicus555> ll
[12:01:24] <ganicus555> lol
[12:01:27] <ganicus555> I use only django
[12:01:28] <thinkxl> I get out the rock one day per week
[12:01:40] <stompdaroach> thats healthy enough
[12:01:45] <thinkxl> see reddit, imgur, 9gag and hackernews
[12:01:47] <thinkxl> then come back
[12:02:05] <thinkxl> ganicus555: you like everything pre-built, then you must like Angular
[12:02:10] <thinkxl> lol
[12:02:26] <TeddyMurray> how would i make an image appear above a jquery mobile element?
[12:02:32] <TeddyMurray> im using z-index
[12:02:35] <ganicus555> guess so
[12:02:38] <TeddyMurray> but it still appears above
[12:02:49] <thinkxl> TeddyMurray: you have position: relative; ?
[12:03:02] <TeddyMurray> yeah
[12:03:07] <thinkxl> then don't know
[12:03:27] <thinkxl> TeddyMurray: show your code or your website so somebody can see where the problem is
[12:03:36] <thinkxl> and help you
[12:03:37] <ganicus555> still python is more readable , so thats one more considuration
[12:03:41] <TeddyMurray> ok
[12:03:45] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[12:03:50] <thinkxl> ganicus555: that is your opinion
[12:04:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:04:10] <thinkxl> braces in JavaScript and scoping are more readable
[12:04:24] <thinkxl> also JavaScript callback are awesome
[12:04:31] <thinkxl> s/are/is
[12:04:59] <ganicus555> I agree about callbacks but in general python forces you to write cleaner
[12:04:59] <thinkxl> ganicus555: but you are comparing apples with bananas
[12:05:17] <thinkxl> ganicus555: no language forces nobody to write cleaner
[12:05:27] <BillCriswell> I wonder why "Apples and Oranges" got so popular.
[12:05:31] <robertmaxrees> I'll agree that the enforcement of whitespace can be a good thing for format, but that doesn't make code inherently "cleaner"
[12:05:36] <BillCriswell> They're like the same shape and size almost.
[12:05:45] <BillCriswell> Apples and Bananans works better I think.
[12:05:46] <thinkxl> lol
[12:06:01] <BillCriswell> Am I off topic again?
[12:06:12] <robertmaxrees> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges
[12:06:32] <thinkxl> I have seen very awful python code lately
[12:06:36] <thinkxl> most of it on my repos, lol
[12:06:42] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ohhhhh
[12:06:44] <meLon> Does jQuery have a 'toggle' method that doesn't affect visibility?
[12:06:50] <thinkxl> ganicus555: whatever works better for you, go for it
[12:07:10] <thinkxl> meLon: toggleClass
[12:07:27] <ganicus555> so besides databinding any other main pro's for taking a js framework ?
[12:07:36] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 that's ephemeral.
[12:07:40] <robertmaxrees> which framework?
[12:07:44] <robertmaxrees> what problems are you trying to solve?
[12:07:47] <ganicus555> backbone or angular
[12:07:50] <BillCriswell> NASA agrees with me.
[12:08:07] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 if you need MV*, they're good to use.
[12:08:13] <robertmaxrees> there are alternatives out there, btw.
[12:08:15] <ganicus555> mainly i want to be able to code fast , on the backend side im pretty good with django
[12:08:30] <meLon> thinkxl: I want '.toggle(function() { '-like method (where I can do much more than change classes)
[12:08:31] <robertmaxrees> you have riot, vue, react, and some others available.
[12:08:31] <thinkxl> ganicus555: if you like django you must like angular
[12:08:38] <ganicus555> on the the frontend right now just jquery and clean JS as much as i can
[12:08:47] <robertmaxrees> some people like django for the modularity, thinkxl
[12:08:47] <thinkxl> ganicus555: backbone you have to write a lot of functionality by yourself
[12:08:50] <BillCriswell> Should I take a 5 day weekend?
[12:09:10] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: he agreed that he liked pre-built stuff
[12:09:18] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.
[12:09:27] <thinkxl> meLon: create your own method
[12:09:34] <thinkxl> toggleStuff();
[12:09:41] <thinkxl> with the extend api
[12:10:05] <ganicus555> So angular would go better with django ?
[12:10:20] <thinkxl> ganicus555: try both, what suits better for you
[12:10:20] <thinkxl> choose that one
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> with your style,
[12:10:24] <thinkxl> there are not this better than that
[12:10:29] <ganicus555> would you say the learning curves are the same ?
[12:10:37] <robertmaxrees> roughly.
[12:10:41] <thinkxl> oum...
[12:10:43] <thinkxl> probably
[12:10:48] <BillCriswell> Learning curves for what? Angular and Backbone?
[12:10:52] <ganicus555> y
[12:10:54] <thinkxl> Angular a little longer I guess
[12:11:11] <thinkxl> ganicus555: I would say read a little bit more about design patterns
[12:11:14] <thinkxl> before going that path
[12:11:23] <ganicus555> which one angular?
[12:11:23] <thinkxl> google JavaScript design patterns by Addy Osomani
[12:11:29] <ganicus555> k tnx
[12:11:51] <BillCriswell> Angular is a monster.
[12:12:12] <thinkxl> Ember is monster
[12:12:18] <robertmaxrees> you're a monster.
[12:12:22] <BillCriswell> They're both monsters.
[12:12:26] <thinkxl> BillCriswell: is the monster
[12:12:44] <ganicus555> im kinda bummped I went for a interview for web dev , and they had 6 front end guys said using angular and one Django backend gey :(((
[12:12:48] <BillCriswell> When it comes to how long it takes to pick it up.
[12:13:07] <ganicus555> whats up with this trend to move code to frontend :(
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> ganicus555 depends on the use case.
[12:13:19] <thinkxl> ganicus555: well, you have to move fast
[12:13:51] <ganicus555> how is that even possible 6 ppl on frontend vs 1 guy backend.. :(
[12:14:12] <thinkxl> well... what I see front-end people make nicer things than back-end
[12:14:33] <thinkxl> nowdays back-end people doing front-end is bower install bootstrap
[12:14:46] <xpheres> I installed bootstrap
[12:14:47] <ganicus555> wana here a joke ?
[12:14:52] <xpheres> but I don't rely all of it
[12:14:53] <ganicus555> hear*
[12:15:12] <xpheres> installing boostrap does not mean everything you do uses it
[12:15:13] <ganicus555> how do u call a russian doing DevOPS?
[12:15:28] <thinkxl> xpheres: I was kinda joking
[12:15:32] <xpheres> hehe ok
[12:15:44] <thinkxl> I know bootstrap is very useful
[12:15:58] <xpheres> I installed bootstrap in a project recently and I find it very cool for menus and messages and contact forms
[12:16:00] <thinkxl> but I joke about it to make people mad, same as jQuery haters
[12:16:12] <xpheres> but everything is else is not bootstrap
[12:16:15] <xpheres> but php and javascript
[12:16:18] <thinkxl> xpheres: for example I'm a front-end guy and I do a style-guide for each project
[12:16:24] <xpheres> cool
[12:16:33] <thinkxl> buuut if is a admin panel
[12:16:33] <xpheres> I need a front end developer
[12:16:38] <thinkxl> I go bootstrap 100%
[12:16:44] <BillCriswell> ganicus555: I really like vuejs.org if you're looking for something like.. right in the middle of angular and backbone.
[12:16:47] <xpheres> you may want to have a look at my project and give me feedback
[12:17:01] <xpheres> ?
[12:17:02] <thinkxl> BillCriswell: you get paid every time you promote vue right
[12:17:06] <thinkxl> xpheres: let me see
[12:17:10] <BillCriswell> thinkxl: I wish!
[12:17:33] <BillCriswell> The lead dev of Vue is now on the meteor team.
[12:17:42] <BillCriswell> So I'm hoping he brings what I like to meteor haha
[12:18:02] <thinkxl> haha
[12:18:28] <thinkxl> xpheres: well, you need to work on your design taste, I mean color, UI/UX all that stuff
[12:18:43] <thinkxl> give it more personality
[12:18:56] <thinkxl> http://rocketb.in/
[12:19:06] <thinkxl> I just finished this paste bin clone, but I don't think it looks like pastebin
[12:19:19] <thinkxl> so you can remember it for being a little bit different than average
[12:19:36] <thinkxl> powered by jQuery so I'm on-topic
[12:19:38] <thinkxl> lol
[12:19:47] <ganicus555> awww wow so many framework much learn
[12:19:48] <xpheres> yes thinkxl
[12:19:48] <xpheres> I know
[12:19:53] <xpheres> but I'm more developerr than designer
[12:20:21] <thinkxl> you can start reading about design
[12:20:42] <thinkxl> xpheres: https://hackdesign.org/
[12:20:51] <thinkxl> http://designforhackers.com/
[12:21:10] <ganicus555> whats the diffence between vue mVVM and angular MVC?
[12:22:03] <thinkxl> ganicus555: really?
[12:22:27] <thinkxl> haha you can read that in the documentation
[12:24:02] <xpheres> thanks thinkxl
[12:24:07] <xpheres> I subscribed
[12:24:10] <ganicus555> ok one last question for today , any toughts about coffescript ?
[12:24:22] <ganicus555> looks like its desined for pythonisnt no ? ?
[12:24:32] <thinkxl> ganicus555: creator is a ruby developer
[12:24:37] <thinkxl> so python wasn't in his mind I guess
[12:24:52] <ganicus555> ruby very close you know...
[12:24:59] <thinkxl> most of coffeescript syntax is very ruby alike
[12:25:11] <ganicus555> and also python like...
[12:25:22] <thinkxl> ok if you think that, that's fine
[12:25:31] <thinkxl> but take out of your head that you are going to write python for the web
[12:25:52] <thinkxl> you need to open your mind and say "Python isn't everything in this world"
[12:26:38] <ganicus555> well i prefer python for web than ruby
[12:27:20] <thinkxl> you can do python for the back-end, but if you do web you still have to do front-end
[12:27:24] <thinkxl> and that means JavaScript
[12:29:08] <ganicus555> sure but it looks like coffescript is an attemp to make fontend a bit more like writing ruby (or a bit python),
[12:29:16] <ganicus555> so you write all ruby like ,
[12:29:24] <thinkxl> what's your point
[12:29:44] <thinkxl> you asking something I'm answering it, but everything I answer it you say something against that
[12:29:47] <ganicus555> i was just trying to figure before what framwork to choose
[12:29:53] <ganicus555> thats it
[12:30:03] <thinkxl> try all, stick with the one you like most
[12:30:08] <ganicus555> rgr that
[12:30:24] <ganicus555> gonna take your advice for angular
[12:30:58] <thinkxl> cool :)
[12:31:27] <ganicus555> sorry for being a bit of a butthole :)
[12:31:44] <thinkxl> no worries I wasn't trying to be a dick
[12:32:00] <thinkxl> just getting to the point
[12:32:45] <ganicus555> no homo
[12:42:29] <notchris> How can I add “data-target” to a link with a specific URL
[12:59:23] <pentagrass> I have a div with content that overflows. When it overflows, it scrolls. Is there a way to have it automatically scroll to the bottom?
[13:00:50] <pentagrass> I tried doing something like this: <a href='#bottom'><div><!-- content--> <a id='bottom'></a></div> Then in a script on document.ready, I triggered "click" on the anchor
[13:01:14] <decx> element.scrollTop(999999999999) will do in most cases, but you can also be perfect with scrollTop( element.prop('scrollheight') - element.height() )
[13:01:56] <pentagrass> decx: How will scrollTop bring me all the way to the bottom of the content?
[13:02:36] <decx> because that's what scrollTop does, it goes to a scrollpoint
[13:02:57] <pentagrass> decx: ah, I just thought it was counter-intuitive
[13:04:55] <pentagrass> decx: I the second "perfect" method you described, but no luck
[13:05:13] <pentagrass> decx: I did $.scrollTop( ... ) // but I didn't see you use $ in your example
[13:05:25] <snover> “999999999999”
[13:05:47] <decx> element.scrollTop assumes that you cache your $('#mydiv') selector into an element variable
[13:06:25] <pentagrass> decx: you are the man, man.
[13:06:43] <pentagrass> decx: or woman, I don't discriminate
[13:08:16] <pentagrass> decx: but in all seriousness, that worked and I greatly appreciate your help.

[13:46:38] <wa5ted> why
[13:46:43] <PenguinMan98> Because I have datepickers
[13:47:06] <PenguinMan98> So they can either use those (mouseup) or just type the dates in (keyup)
[13:48:12] <PenguinMan98> I used to attach to the onChange but I switched away from it and I can't remember offhand why.
[13:49:34] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: The input even would probably be your best bet.

[13:50:56] <PenguinMan98> *goes to read*
[13:51:02] <BillCriswell> It's like a keyup, but it only runs when the actual content of the element changes.

[14:22:21] <Paradisee> how can i put an index here? $.each(data, function(room, room_obj) {
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee is data an array?
[14:24:11] <Paradisee> json
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> array or object?
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> JSON is a format that can be either.
[14:25:04] <Paradisee> room is a string
[14:25:10] <Paradisee> but i need to get an index also
[14:25:20] <Paradisee> but i wont use a global
[14:25:21] <robertmaxrees> if data isn't an array, there's no index to be had.
[14:56:16] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/04S6K9R

[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[14:58:07] <Paradisee> well, i create the button dinamically inside the table....
[14:58:14] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:58:20] <robertmaxrees> does the table exist on load?
[14:58:36] <Paradisee> yes but not the tr td button

[15:08:20] <robertmaxrees> on what line?
[15:08:48] <Paradisee> var room = $(this).prop('text');
[15:09:23] <robertmaxrees> should work fine unless your markup isn't what you think it is.
[15:09:35] <robertmaxrees> thought hat's not a valid attribute.
[15:09:59] <robertmaxrees> Are you trying to get the text of the button?

[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it up pls

[15:13:30] <robertmaxrees> why did you remove the delegated listener?
[15:13:45] <Paradisee> did i?
[15:14:01] <Paradisee> oh, i didnt put it
[15:14:59] <Paradisee> http://jsfiddle.net/hnr83kaj/6/
[15:15:00] <Paradisee> ^
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:15:12] <ntcbow> $(el).text() or $(el).html() should do it
[15:15:13] <robertmaxrees> a small test case yo.
[15:16:13] <robertmaxrees> if you want the text of something, use .text()
[15:16:45] <Paradisee> i just want to add test over there
[15:16:49] <Paradisee> text*
[15:17:04] <Paradisee> when i press on a different button it should change
[15:17:10] <Paradisee> based on the button text
[15:17:48] <Paradisee> undefined system.js:136
[15:17:48] <Paradisee> "Kitchen-1"
[15:17:51] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the basic ide.a
[15:18:01] <Paradisee> var room = $(this).prop('text');
[15:18:06] <robertmaxrees> $(this).text()
[15:18:10] <robertmaxrees> not .prop('text')
[15:18:31] <Paradisee> it has a value text:
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> text is not a valid attribute
[15:19:14] <Paradisee> ok now it works
[15:19:16] <Paradisee> stupid js
[15:19:21] <ntcbow> $('#myModal').on('clic... var room = $(this).text(); does log to console, but "this" is #myModal and has no text... me thinks
[15:19:21] <robertmaxrees> js isn't the problem here.,
[15:20:12] <Paradisee> well im not really sure eh
[15:20:26] <robertmaxrees> you're tackling too much at once.
[15:20:33] <Paradisee> i created the button dinamically using text: ''
[15:20:45] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything.
[15:20:48] <Paradisee> its not coerent...
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> what is "text: ''"
[15:20:59] <Paradisee> consistency*
[15:21:13] <robertmaxrees> javascript and jquery are plenty consistent in cases like this.
[15:21:20] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2FMTYJ3
[15:21:21] <Paradisee> ^
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you still read that using .text()
[15:21:53] <robertmaxrees> the example you sent just sets a textnode on the element.
[15:21:56] <Paradisee> and for the others prop
[15:22:04] <robertmaxrees> for the data attributes, you'd use .data()
[15:22:08] <robertmaxrees> .data('toggle')
[15:22:10] <Paradisee> just no sense for me :D
[15:22:21] <Paradisee> i know that bu you could also use prop anyway
[15:22:22] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> you SHOULD use .data() imo
[15:22:45] <Paradisee> ofc
[15:22:51] <Paradisee> and i actually do
[15:23:05] <Paradisee> well, i learned a new thing
[15:24:00] <robertmaxrees> good
[15:27:01] <Paradisee> is 'something new' a valid id?
[15:27:06] <Paradisee> with a space
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#id
[15:37:15] <tejas-manohar> can i print jquery version to console?

[15:40:36] <Paradisee> ?
[15:41:00] <ntcbow> Paradisee if you click the reset button it logs "reset" to console
[15:50:01] <ntcbow> Paradisee seen it? here i pulled the modal up a little.. http://jsfiddle.net/hnr83kaj/8/
[15:51:02] <ntcbow> ohh noo it didn't, i've messed it up again..
[15:52:07] <Paradisee> does anybody can download my project and see how can i fix a thing?
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:52:16] <Paradisee> i can't explain in a fiddle
[15:52:26] <ntcbow> yeah it does.. http://jsfiddle.net/hnr83kaj/9/
[15:52:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[15:52:38] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: can you?
[15:52:44] <robertmaxrees> i won't download it, to.
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> *no
[15:52:49] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having?
[15:53:01] <Paradisee> its too hard to explain
[15:53:12] <robertmaxrees> try
[15:53:19] <Paradisee> you wont understand
[15:53:23] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[15:53:24] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[15:53:46] <Paradisee> someone need to download it and see with his eyes
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> can you describe the problem anyway?
[15:54:01] <robertmaxrees> just for giggles
[15:54:20] <Paradisee> well...
[15:54:21] <Paradisee> let's try
[15:54:50] <Paradisee> i have this html: http://dpaste.com/3KZM355
[15:55:24] <Paradisee> there's a table and a modal right?
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:56:09] <Paradisee> when the page is loaded:
[15:56:10] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/35PKDVP
[15:56:29] <Paradisee> it actually fill the table with one button each row
[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> ok
[15:57:14] <Paradisee> after that: http://dpaste.com/07KH20E
[15:57:28] <Paradisee> it fills the modal too
[15:57:42] <Paradisee> i mean..
[15:57:48] <Paradisee> it fills the tabs in the modal
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:57:58] <Paradisee> fine......
[15:58:38] <Paradisee> bootstrap allows you to open the modal with those buttons i made
[15:58:51] <Paradisee> so i do not need js at all for that
[15:58:56] <Paradisee> is it ok until here?
[15:59:07] <robertmaxrees> you're making this far too complicated.
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[15:59:13] <Paradisee> i told you
[15:59:18] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3YA32W7
[15:59:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm telling you.
[15:59:40] <robertmaxrees> in one sentence, what is the issue you're having?
[15:59:41] <Paradisee> this allow to switch into the tabs in the modal
[16:00:01] <Paradisee> the problem is.....
[16:00:20] <Paradisee> i have to rows in the table, so tot button right?
[16:00:22] <Paradisee> tot*
[16:00:29] <Paradisee> lets say 5
[16:00:46] <Paradisee> those 5 represents 5 rooms
[16:01:30] <Paradisee> when i click on one of those, i have to be able to change the sliders in the json of that room
[16:02:22] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/01JEYVE
[16:02:27] <Paradisee> this is the json
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> you're doing too much at once.
[16:02:53] <robertmaxrees> break the problem up into smaller parts.
[16:03:44] <Paradisee> do you have a better suggestion to make it?
[16:03:55] <Paradisee> it is a thermostat
[16:03:58] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down into steps.
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> abstract things out.
[16:04:03] <Paradisee> a weekly thermostat
[16:04:08] <robertmaxrees> "when I click x, i want y to happen"
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> break y down into its component parts.  work on each of those.
[16:04:28] <Paradisee> already done
[16:04:33] <Paradisee> now i have to do this part
[16:05:18] <robertmaxrees> you just gave me 4 or 5 links worth of JS and html and a very confusing description.  boil your question down into one sentence.
[16:05:32] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: that was only 1 file
[16:05:42] <Paradisee> it was for you to be able to understand the problem
[16:05:51] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[16:06:04] <Paradisee> what does it mean
[16:06:16] <robertmaxrees> you're making the problem much more complex than it needs to be.
[16:06:32] <Paradisee> well, i didnt have other ideas
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> break the large problem down into smaller ones.
[16:07:11] <Paradisee> im telling you that im not able to do this part
[16:07:19] <Paradisee> i have no idea how
[16:07:48] <robertmaxrees> how have you gotten so far in the project, then?
[16:07:58] <Paradisee> like you just said
[16:08:01] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting code?
[16:08:11] <Paradisee> ofc not
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to say "when I click x, I need y to happen"
[16:08:16] <Paradisee> im a python programmer not a js
[16:08:21] <Paradisee> i totally hate this language
[16:08:34] <robertmaxrees> i like JS.,
[16:08:38] <Paradisee> well i dont
[16:08:38] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating things.
[16:09:08] <duckxx_> what mega menu module does everyone use? or a module recipe? was thinking about tb mega menu, but seeing what alternatives are there.
[16:09:26] <Paradisee> boostrap gh
[16:25:13] <Paradisee> i wrote this so far: http://dpaste.com/1EWH31A
[16:25:39] <Paradisee> so now i need to change the values to the real one from the json
[16:26:09] <Paradisee> how do i change the value of this: http://dpaste.com/07KH20E
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> whch values?  room, day, and hour?
[16:26:35] <Paradisee> on the temp_value
[16:26:45] <Paradisee> only
[16:27:13] <Paradisee> these sliders are made dinamically
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> pass in the data you need explicitly.
[16:27:42] <Paradisee> so when i load these values, the sliders have to change values
[16:27:53] <Paradisee> what do you mean
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> right, so when you load your data, you reinitialize your slider
[16:28:23] <Paradisee> my question basically is: how do i select the right slider to change value?
[16:31:01] <Paradisee> did you get my question?
[16:31:24] <Paradisee> http://www.filedropper.com/thermostat_3
[16:31:36] <Paradisee> anyway this is the project, you just need to do:
[16:31:44] <Paradisee> apt-get install python-flask
[16:31:52] <Paradisee> python index.py
[16:31:55] <Paradisee> that's it
[16:47:22] <Mark_2> anybody know how to emulate this navigaion ? the background color changes from black to white when it reaches certain scroll point. http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/demo9/#section-our-story
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away
[16:50:29] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee that's... a little much.
[16:51:07] <robertmaxrees> and you need to give each slider a unique ID to select on.
[16:53:45] <reynierpm> hi there and happy new year, almost, to every one, can any take a look to this post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27712487/nested-ajax-request-in-javascript-jquery-its-a-good-practice and give me some ideas?
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> That's not abnormal.
[16:54:43] <robertmaxrees> that's what promises are for.
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> if you need data from the first call to make the second, there's really no way around it.
[16:55:46] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I never work with promises before, will be possible, if is not to much, for you to setup a simple example just to get how them works?
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> you're using them now ;)
[16:55:58] <robertmaxrees> .done() uses promises.
[16:56:01] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees that is the problem I need data from the first call
[16:56:13] <robertmaxrees> what your're doing is what you'd wind up doing anyway.
[16:56:18] <reynierpm> umm amazing did not know
[16:56:36] <reynierpm> so there is no way to avoid the behavior?
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> if you need the data from the first to make the second, not really.
[16:56:51] <reynierpm> if I have 100 rows will be 99 unnecesary calls?
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> if you need the data, they're not unnecessary.
[16:57:35] <reynierpm> can I share my code with you?
[16:57:46] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle, sure
[16:57:56] <reynierpm> maybe you know a better way
[16:58:03] <reynierpm> waits a minute let me create the fiddle
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you're not listening.
[16:58:30] <robertmaxrees> do you need data from the first ajax call to make the second one?
[16:58:31] <reynierpm> why not?
[16:58:35] <reynierpm> yes
[16:58:39] <reynierpm> I need it
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> then you have to nest those calls
[16:59:11] <reynierpm> unless there is another way to share the data from the first call outside and use on click event
[16:59:42] <robertmaxrees> is the first ajax call the same for every button?
[17:00:29] <reynierpm> the first call just add some code to the DOM but second call is the same for every button
[17:00:49] <reynierpm> here http://jsfiddle.net/cjLejc71/ is not the functional example but will give you a better idea
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> but the second call relies on something from the first - that means what you have is basically what you get.
[17:01:30] <reynierpm> unfortunatelly yes, the second call depends on the first results since data comes from result
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> right.  and since that first one is unique, the second one is unique as well.
[17:01:55] <robertmaxrees> so you can't really skirt the problem.
[17:02:20] <reynierpm> ummm I don´t follow you, why the three calls on the first button? because the class selector?
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:02:57] <reynierpm> did you see the **Test #1** part on the post I point here?
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> that looked like another question to me.
[17:03:30] <robertmaxrees> your original question about nested ajax calls is what it is.
[17:03:35] <robertmaxrees> do you have a second question?
[17:03:56] <reynierpm> Hmmm yes the second one is the issue right now, perhaps should open a new question
[17:04:06] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> and the short answer is that you should use event delegation instead of creating a new listener.
[17:04:44] <reynierpm> event delegation as the answer on that post?
[17:04:50] <robertmaxrees> the second question, yeah.
[17:05:15] <robertmaxrees> that'll require you store the relevant data you care about in a ddifferent place (like using .data() on the nodes), but it'll take care of you re-binding the handlers.
[17:05:26] <reynierpm> but how I pass parameters from the first Ajax call to that event?
[17:05:39] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[17:05:42] <robertmaxrees> that's what I'm saying.
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing anything, you store that data somewhere else.
[17:06:18] <reynierpm> so on this line     <td><a data-backdrop="static" data-target="#addPaisesFabricante" data-toggle="modal" data-iteration="0" data-id="18" data-idpais="1" class="editable-pais" href="javascript:void(0)"><i title="" data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="fa fa-plus-circle" data-original-title="Agregar países"></i></a></td> I am already doing that right?
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> looks like it.
[17:06:51] <robertmaxrees> you just read those using .data(), instead of doing data.ent.id.
[17:06:55] <reynierpm> ok I get it now, thanks I´ll try if I have any other issues I will come back
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[17:07:11] <reynierpm> right, the node itself .data(´property´)
[17:07:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[17:07:20] <reynierpm> thanks
[17:07:27] <reynierpm> let me change my code to suit that
[17:51:12] <Busserl> Hi, what does this comment on stackoverflow about using jquery and phonegap together mean? Is it just about being able to write some code outside of doWhenBothFrameworksLoaded() in the answer? So inside this function I would be able to use both, but outside I could connect to the database in a script in <head> for example?  http://bit.ly/1rylapP
[17:52:34] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[17:52:50] <robertmaxrees> that uses two deferred objects that you resolve - then they both resolve, you run other coder.
[17:52:51] <robertmaxrees> *code
[17:56:38] <Busserl> robertmaxrees: OK, I do understand what deferred does, I am just a little unsure what the comment regarding to the question meant. Deferred lets me do something when both are loaded, I understand that. But the comment is about doing something before initmobile is fired, or jquerymobile is usable, nothing more, correct?
[17:57:09] <robertmaxrees> it lets you do things when both are usable.
[17:58:12] <Busserl> robertmaxrees: Yes, but the comment in the link is actually about separating that code from stuff, where these frameworks are not required, isn't it? :)
[17:58:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:58:29] <robertmaxrees> back up - what's your actual question?
[18:00:37] <Busserl> I just wanted to see if I undersood that one comment correctly. :) It is about making a DB connection as an example. I guess that connection in the example would not require jquerymobile and phonegap, so it could be run outside of the function triggered by the deferred, when both frameworks are ready?
[18:01:26] <robertmaxrees> the comment is to address cases where you need two different libraries loaded in order to do something.
[18:01:29] <Busserl> I guess the example was just about separating the code which needs both frameworks from the code which doesn't?
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you need both jqm and phonegap available and ready for use before you cna do anything
[18:02:13] <Busserl> robertmaxrees: I see, thanks
[18:02:31] <Busserl> I understood it differently.
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> the comment is alluding to an example where you might try to do something via jqm that you can't quite do because the other library isn't ready in time.
[18:03:07] <Busserl> robertmaxrees: I see now, I thought it was an example of an opposite case. :)
[18:03:10] <Busserl> thanks
[18:03:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:20:31] <spudzee> Does anyone know how to replicate the mouse un-bluring / un-dark effect that moving your mouse has on this site: https://www.canva.com/
[18:21:49] <spudzee> I'm so freakin in love with that effect
[18:46:30] <shoky> spudzee: http://jsfiddle.net/Lm6goLyr/   they add "_color" to the filename of the unblurred image.
[18:47:51] <shoky> spudzee: better now  http://jsfiddle.net/Lm6goLyr/1/
[18:56:33] <spudzee> shoky, I can't figure out how it works. It looks overly complicated
[18:58:39] <spudzee> shoky, how does it know what the image looks like unblurred?
[18:58:56] <spudzee> or does it blur the image?
[18:58:58] <spudzee> wtf
[19:00:00] <spudzee> me = confused
[19:01:07] <shoky> spudzee: https://static.canva.com/static/images/bg_travel.jpg  https://static.canva.com/static/images/bg_travel_color.jpg
[19:01:38] <spudzee> I want to worship whoever made this, they are my new god
[19:01:44] <spudzee> the god of jquery
[19:12:15] <Robdgreat> and robertmaxrees is his prophet
[20:40:42] <hanuman> hi  for select text, is working in firefox and google chrome but not in IE how can i change
[20:41:40] <Robdgreat> sounds right on
[20:42:02] <Robdgreat> encourage more people to use this code
[20:58:12] <hanuman> select text code by clicking in internet explorer
[22:28:36] <enigmabomb> Hey guys. Im having some trouble with a change event. Here’s a fiddle I made: http://jsfiddle.net/hx2m5zgt/ What’s wrong here?
[22:39:15] <Robdgreat> enigmabomb: you're not saying what it's doing
[22:41:46] <Robdgreat> enigmabomb: you want $lat.show();
[22:41:53] <Robdgreat> and $lat.hide();
[22:42:15] <Robdgreat> since you defined $lat as the desired elements at the top
[23:50:03] <hanuman> how can i select text by clicking in bootstrap modal
[23:59:40] <Mark_2> does anybody know what kind of slide this is? http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge/
